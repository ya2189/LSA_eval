mäzli
a
story
of
the
swiss
valleys
by
johanna
spyri
author
of
heidi
cornelli
etc
translated
by
elisabeth
stork
foreword
the
present
story
is
the
third
by
madame
spyri
to
appear
in
this
series
for
many
years
the
author
was
known
almost
entirely
for
her
alpine
classic
heidi
the
publication
of
a
second
story
cornelli
during
the
past
year
was
so
favorably
received
as
to
assure
success
for
a
further
venture
mäzli
may
be
pronounced
the
most
natural
and
one
of
the
most
entertaining
of
madame
spyri
creations
the
atmosphere
is
created
by
an
old
swiss
castle
and
by
the
romantic
associations
of
the
noble
family
who
lived
there
plot
interest
is
supplied
in
abundance
by
the
children
of
the
bergmann
family
with
varying
characters
and
interests
a
more
charming
group
of
young
people
and
a
more
wise
and
affectionate
mother
would
be
hard
to
find
every
figure
is
individual
and
true
to
life
with
his
or
her
special
virtues
and
foibles
so
that
any
grown
person
who
picks
up
the
volume
will
find
it
a
world
in
miniature
and
will
watch
eagerly
for
the
special
characteristics
of
each
child
to
reappear
naturalness
generosity
and
forbearance
are
shown
throughout
not
by
precept
but
by
example
the
story
is
at
once
entertaining
healthy
and
in
the
best
sense
of
a
word
often
misused
sweet
insipid
books
do
no
one
any
good
but
few
readers
of
whatever
age
they
may
be
will
fail
to
enjoy
and
be
the
better
for
mäzli
it
may
save
trouble
to
give
here
a
summary
of
the
bergmann
household
the
mother
is
sometimes
called
rector
on
account
of
her
being
the
widow
of
a
former
rector
of
the
parish
and
sometimes
maxa
to
avoid
confusion
with
the
wife
of
the
present
rector
it
is
as
if
there
were
two
john
smiths
one
of
whom
is
called
helen
maxa
being
of
course
a
feminine
christian
name
of
the
five
children
the
eldest
is
the
impulsive
bruno
who
is
just
of
an
age
to
go
away
to
a
city
school
next
comes
his
sister
mea
whose
fault
is
that
she
is
too
submissive
and
confiding
kurt
the
second
boy
is
the
most
enterprising
and
humorous
of
the
family
whereas
lippo
another
boy
is
the
soul
of
obedience
and
formality
most
original
of
all
is
mäzli
probably
not
over
six
as
she
is
too
young
to
go
to
school
the
writer
of
this
preface
knows
of
one
family
not
his
own
either
which
is
waiting
eagerly
for
another
book
by
the
author
of
heidi
and
cornelli
to
this
and
all
families
desirous
of
a
story
full
of
genuine
fun
and
genuine
feeling
the
present
volume
may
be
recommended

qualification

said
lippo
again
after
scrutinizing
the
unusual
performance
she
went
with
folded
hands
from
one
bed
to
the
other
before
following
her
brother
she
wanted
to
see
exactly
what
the
knight
looked
like
he
shook
the
little
girl
hand
with
all
his
might
can
you
guess
why
i
am
taking
you
up
there
a
head
was
raised
up
and
two
sharp
eyes
were
directed
towards
her
it
seemed
to
crown
all
the
preceding
pleasures
to
roam
without
restraint
in
the
woods
and
meadows
chapter
i
in
nolla
for
nearly
twenty
years
the
fine
old
castle
had
stood
silent
and
deserted
on
the
in
its
neighborhood
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
except
the
twittering
of
the
birds
and
the
soughing
of
the
old
on
bright
summer
evenings
the
swallows
whizzed
as
before
about
the
corner
gables
but
no
more
merry
eyes
looked
down
from
the
balconies
to
the
green
meadows
and
richly
laden
apple
trees
in
the
valley
but
just
now
two
merry
eyes
were
searchingly
raised
to
the
castle
from
the
meadow
below
as
if
they
might
discover
something
extraordinary
behind
the
shutters
mea
come
quick
the
young
spy
exclaimed
excitedly
look
now
opening
mea
who
was
sitting
on
the
bench
under
the
large
apple
tree
with
a
book
put
aside
the
volume
and
came
running
look
look
now
it
moving
her
brother
continued
with
growing
suspense
it
the
arm
of
a
black
coat
wait
soon
the
whole
shutter
will
be
opened
at
this
moment
a
black
object
lifted
itself
and
soared
up
to
the
tower
it
was
only
a
bird
a
large
said
the
disappointed
mea
you
have
called
me
at
least
twenty
times
already
every
time
you
think
that
the
shutters
will
open
and
they
never
do
you
can
call
as
often
as
you
please
from
now
on
i
shall
certainly
not
come
again
i
know
they
will
open
some
day
the
boy
asserted
firmly
only
we
tell
just
when
but
it
might
be
any
time
if
only
stiff
old
trius
would
answer
the
questions
we
ask
him
he
knows
everything
that
is
going
on
up
there
but
the
old
crosspatch
never
says
a
word
when
one
comes
near
him
to
talk
all
he
does
is
to
come
along
with
his
big
stick
he
naturally
does
want
anybody
to
know
what
is
happening
up
there
but
everybody
in
school
knows
that
a
ghost
wanders
about
and
sighs
through
the
pine
trees
mother
has
said
more
than
once
that
nothing
is
going
on
there
at
all
she
does
want
you
to
talk
about
the
ghost
with
the
and
she
has
asked
you
not
to
try
to
find
out
what
they
know
about
it
you
know
too
that
mother
wants
you
to
call
the
castle
watchman
trius
and
not
just
trius
oh
yes
i
call
him
trius
but
i
make
up
such
a
song
about
him
that
everybody
will
know
who
it
is
about
kurt
said
threateningly
how
can
he
help
it
when
there
is
no
ghost
in
wildenstein
about
which
he
could
tell
you
tales
mea
remarked
oh
he
has
enough
to
tell
kurt
eagerly
continued
many
wonderful
things
must
have
happened
in
a
castle
that
is
a
thousand
years
old
he
knows
them
all
and
could
tell
us
but
his
only
answer
to
every
question
is
a
beating
you
know
mea
that
i
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
or
spirits
but
it
is
so
exciting
to
imagine
that
an
old
old
baron
of
wallerstätten
might
wander
around
the
battlements
in
his
armor
i
love
to
imagine
him
standing
under
the
old
pine
trees
with
wild
eyes
and
threatening
gestures
i
love
to
think
of
fighting
him
or
telling
him
that
i
am
not
afraid
oh
yes
i
am
sure
you
would
run
away
if
the
armoured
knight
with
his
wild
eyes
should
come
nearer
said
mea
it
is
never
hard
to
be
brave
when
one
is
as
far
away
from
danger
as
you
are
now
oho
so
you
think
i
would
be
afraid
of
a
ghost
kurt
exclaimed
laughing
i
am
sure
that
the
ghost
would
rather
run
away
from
me
if
i
shouted
at
him
very
loudly
i
shall
make
a
song
about
him
soon
and
then
we
go
up
and
sing
it
for
him
all
my
school
friends
want
to
go
with
me
max
hans
and
clevi
his
sister
you
must
come
too
mea
and
then
you
see
how
the
ghost
will
sneak
away
as
soon
as
we
scream
at
him
and
sing
awfully
loud
but
kurt
how
can
a
ghost
which
does
exist
sneak
away
mea
exclaimed
with
all
your
wild
ideas
about
fighting
you
seem
to
really
believe
that
there
is
a
ghost
in
wildenstein
you
must
understand
mea
that
this
is
only
to
prove
that
there
is
none
kurt
eagerly
went
on
a
real
ghost
could
rush
towards
us
mad
with
rage
if
we
challenged
him
that
way
you
will
see
what
happens
it
will
be
a
great
triumph
for
me
to
prove
to
all
the
school
and
the
village
people
that
there
is
no
restless
ghost
who
wanders
around
wildenstein
no
i
sha
see
it
because
i
wo
come
mother
does
not
want
us
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this
story
you
know
that
kurt
oh
here
comes
elvira
i
must
speak
to
her
with
these
words
mea
suddenly
flew
down
the
mountainside
a
girl
of
her
own
age
was
slowly
coming
up
the
incline
it
was
hard
to
tell
if
this
measured
walk
was
natural
to
her
or
was
necessary
to
preserve
the
beautiful
red
and
blue
flowers
on
her
little
hat
which
were
not
able
to
stand
much
commotion
it
was
clearly
evident
however
that
the
approaching
girl
had
no
intention
of
changing
her
pace
despite
the
fact
that
she
must
have
noticed
long
ago
the
friend
who
was
hurrying
towards
her
she
certainly
could
move
her
proud
stilts
a
little
quicker
when
she
sees
how
mea
is
running
kurt
said
angrily
mea
should
do
it
oh
well
i
shall
make
a
song
about
elvira
that
she
wo
ever
forget
kurt
now
ran
away
too
but
in
the
opposite
direction
where
he
had
discovered
his
mother
she
was
standing
before
a
rose
bush
from
which
she
was
cutting
faded
blossoms
and
twigs
kurt
was
glad
to
find
his
mother
busy
with
work
which
did
not
occupy
her
thoughts
as
he
often
longed
for
such
an
opportunity
without
success
whenever
he
was
eager
to
discuss
his
special
problems
thoroughly
and
without
being
interrupted
his
young
brother
and
sister
were
sure
to
intrude
with
their
questions
or
the
two
elder
children
needed
her
advice
at
the
same
moment
so
kurt
rushed
into
the
garden
to
take
advantage
of
this
unusual
opportunity
but
today
again
he
was
not
destined
to
have
his
object
fulfilled
before
he
reached
his
mother
a
woman
approached
her
from
the
other
side
and
both
entered
immediately
into
a
lively
conversation
if
it
had
been
somebody
else
than
his
special
old
friend
apollonie
kurt
would
have
felt
very
angry
indeed
but
this
woman
had
gained
great
distinction
in
kurt
eyes
by
being
well
acquainted
with
the
old
caretaker
of
the
castle
so
he
always
had
a
hope
of
hearing
from
her
many
things
that
were
happening
there
to
his
great
satisfaction
he
heard
apollonie
say
on
his
approach
no
no
rector
old
trius
does
not
open
any
windows
in
vain
he
has
not
opened
any
for
nearly
twenty
years
he
might
want
to
wipe
away
the
dust
for
once
in
his
life
it
about
time
kurt
mother
replied
i
do
believe
the
master
has
returned
why
should
the
tower
windows
where
the
master
always
lived
be
opened
then
something
unusual
has
happened
said
apollonie
significantly
the
ghost
of
wildenstein
might
have
pushed
them
open
kurt
quickly
asserted
kurt
ca
you
stop
talking
about
this
story
it
is
only
an
invention
of
people
who
are
not
contented
with
one
misfortune
but
must
make
up
an
added
terror
the
mother
said
with
animation
you
know
kurt
that
i
feel
sorry
about
this
foolish
tale
and
want
you
to
pay
no
attention
to
it
but
mother
i
only
want
to
support
you
i
want
to
help
you
get
rid
of
people
superstitions
and
to
prove
to
them
that
there
is
no
ghost
in
wildenstein
kurt
assured
her
yes
yes
if
only
one
did
not
know
how
the
brothers
no
apollonie
the
rector
widow
interrupted
her
you
least
of
all
should
support
the
belief
in
these
apparitions
everybody
knows
that
you
lived
in
the
castle
more
than
twenty
years
and
so
people
think
that
you
know
what
is
going
on
you
realize
well
enough
that
all
the
talk
has
no
foundation
whatever
apollonie
lightly
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
said
no
more
but
mother
what
can
the
talk
come
from
then
when
there
is
no
foundation
for
it
as
you
say
asked
kurt
who
could
not
let
the
matter
rest
there
is
no
real
foundation
for
the
talk
the
mother
replied
and
no
one
of
all
those
who
talk
has
ever
seen
the
apparition
with
his
own
eyes
it
is
always
other
people
who
tell
and
those
have
been
told
again
by
others
that
something
uncanny
has
been
seen
at
the
castle
the
talk
first
started
from
a
misfortune
which
happened
years
ago
and
later
on
the
matter
came
up
and
people
thought
a
similar
misfortune
had
taken
place
again
although
this
was
an
absolutely
false
report
all
the
old
stories
were
brought
up
again
and
the
talk
became
livelier
than
ever
but
people
who
know
better
should
be
very
emphatic
in
suppressing
it
what
was
the
misfortune
that
happened
long
ago
in
the
castle
and
then
again
kurt
asked
in
great
suspense
i
have
no
time
to
tell
you
now
kurt
the
mother
declared
decisively
you
have
to
attend
to
your
school
work
and
i
to
other
affairs
when
i
have
you
all
together
quietly
some
evening
i
shall
tell
you
about
those
bygone
times
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
know
than
to
muse
about
all
the
reports
you
hear
you
are
most
active
of
all
in
that
kurt
and
i
do
not
like
it
so
i
hope
that
you
will
let
the
matter
rest
as
soon
as
you
have
understood
how
unfounded
the
talk
really
is
come
now
apollonie
and
i
will
give
you
the
plants
you
wanted
i
am
so
glad
to
be
able
to
let
you
have
some
of
my
geraniums
you
keep
your
little
flower
garden
in
such
perfect
order
that
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
it
during
the
foregoing
speeches
apollonie
face
had
clearly
expressed
disagreement
with
what
had
been
said
she
had
however
too
much
respect
for
the
lady
to
utter
her
doubts
bright
sunshine
spread
itself
over
her
features
now
because
her
flower
garden
was
her
greatest
pride
and
joy
yes
yes
rector
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
to
raise
flowers
she
said
nodding
her
head
they
always
do
their
duty
and
if
one
grows
a
little
to
one
side
i
can
put
a
stick
beside
it
and
it
grows
straight
again
as
it
ought
to
if
only
the
child
were
like
that
then
i
should
have
no
more
cares
but
she
only
has
her
own
ideas
in
her
head
and
such
strange
whims
that
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
where
they
come
from
there
is
nothing
bad
about
having
her
own
ideas
replied
the
widow
it
naturally
depends
on
what
kind
of
ideas
they
are
it
seems
to
me
that
loneli
is
a
child
who
is
easily
led
all
children
need
guidance
what
special
whims
does
loneli
have
oh
rector
nobody
knows
what
things
the
child
might
do
apollonie
said
eagerly
yesterday
she
came
home
from
school
with
glowing
eyes
and
said
to
me
i
should
love
to
go
to
spain
beautiful
flowers
of
all
colors
grow
there
and
large
sparkling
grapes
and
the
sun
shines
down
brightly
on
the
flowers
so
that
they
glisten
i
wish
i
could
go
right
away
just
think
of
a
child
saying
such
a
thing
i
wonder
what
to
expect
next
there
is
nothing
very
terrible
about
that
apollonie
said
the
widow
with
a
smile
the
child
might
have
heard
you
mention
spain
yourself
so
that
it
roused
her
imagination
she
probably
heard
in
school
about
the
country
and
her
wish
to
go
there
only
shows
that
she
is
extremely
attentive
to
think
out
how
she
might
get
there
some
time
is
a
very
innocent
pleasure
which
you
can
indulge
i
agree
with
you
that
children
should
be
brought
up
in
a
strict
and
orderly
way
because
they
might
otherwise
start
on
the
wrong
road
and
nobody
loves
such
children
but
loneli
is
not
that
kind
at
all
there
is
no
child
in
nolla
whom
i
would
rather
see
with
my
own
apollonie
honest
face
glowed
anew
that
is
my
greatest
consolation
she
said
and
i
need
it
many
say
to
me
that
an
old
woman
like
me
is
not
able
to
bring
up
and
manage
a
little
child
if
you
once
were
obliged
to
say
to
me
that
i
had
spoiled
my
grandchild
i
should
die
of
shame
but
i
know
that
the
matter
is
still
well
as
long
as
you
like
to
see
the
child
together
with
yours
thank
you
ever
so
much
now
those
will
fill
a
whole
bed
she
continued
upon
receiving
a
large
bunch
of
plants
from
her
kind
friend
please
let
me
know
if
i
can
help
in
any
way
i
am
always
at
home
for
you
rector
you
know
that
apollonie
now
said
with
renewed
thanks
carrying
her
large
green
bundle
very
carefully
in
order
not
to
injure
the
tender
little
branches
she
hurried
through
the
garden
towards
the
castle
height
the
rector
widow
glanced
after
her
thoughtfully
apollonie
was
intimately
connected
with
the
earliest
impressions
of
her
childhood
as
well
as
with
the
experiences
of
her
youth
with
all
the
people
whom
she
had
loved
most
and
who
had
stood
nearest
to
her
her
appearance
therefore
always
brought
up
many
memories
in
maxa
heart
since
her
death
when
she
had
left
the
rectory
in
the
valley
and
had
come
back
to
her
old
home
all
her
friends
called
her
maxa
to
distinguish
her
from
the
present
rector
wife
of
the
village
she
had
been
used
to
see
apollonie
in
her
parents
house
baroness
wallerstätten
the
mistress
of
the
castle
at
that
time
had
often
consulted
the
rector
as
to
many
things
apollonie
a
young
girl
then
had
always
been
her
messenger
and
everyone
liked
to
see
her
at
the
rectory
when
it
was
discovered
how
quick
and
able
young
apollonie
was
things
were
more
and
more
given
into
her
charge
at
the
castle
the
baroness
hardly
undertook
anything
in
her
household
without
consulting
apollonie
and
asking
her
assistance
the
children
who
were
growing
up
also
asked
many
favors
from
her
which
she
was
ever
ready
to
fulfill
the
devoted
faithful
servant
belonged
many
years
so
entirely
to
the
castle
that
everyone
called
her
castle
apollonie
maxa
was
suddenly
interrupted
in
her
thoughts
by
loud
and
repeated
calls
of
mama
mama
mama
it
sounded
once
more
from
two
clear
children
voices
and
a
little
boy
and
girl
stood
before
her
the
teacher
has
read
us
a
paper
on
which
was
written
began
the
boy

interrupted
the
girl
mäzli
said
the
mother

lippo
finish
otherwise
i
ca

what
you
want
mama
the
teacher
has
read
us
a
paper
on
which
was
written
that
in
sils
on
the
mountain
shall
i
too
shall
i
too
mäzli
his
sister
interrupted
again
be
quiet
mäzli
till
lippo
has
finished
the
mother
commanded
he
has
said
the
same
thing
twice
already
and
he
is
so
slow
there
has
been
a
fire
in
sils
on
the
mountain
and
we
are
to
send
things
to
the
people
shall
i
do
it
too
mama
shall
i
too
mäzli
had
told
it
all
in
a
single
breath
you
did
say
it
right
lippo
retorted
angrily
you
did
start
from
the
beginning
one
must
not
start
in
the
middle
the
teacher
told
us
that
now
i
tell
you
mama
the
teacher
has
read
us
a
paper
we
know
that
already
lippo
the
mother
remarked
what
was
in
the
paper
in
the
paper
was
written
that
a
big
fire
in
sils
on
the
mountain
has
destroyed
two
houses
and
everything
in
them
then
the
teacher
said
that
all
the
pupils
of
the
class
shall
i
too
shall
i
too
mäzli
urged
finish
a
little
quicker
now
lippo
said
the
mother
then
the
teacher
said
that
all
the
pupils
from
all
the
classes
must
bring
some
of
their
things
to
give
to
the
poor
children
shall
i
too
mama
shall
i
go
right
away
and
get
together
all
they
need
mäzli
said
rapidly
as
if
the
last
moment
for
action
had
arrived
yes
you
can
give
some
of
your
clothes
and
lippo
can
bring
some
of
his
the
mother
said
i
shall
help
you
for
we
have
plenty
of
time
is
sunday
and
the
children
are
sure
not
to
bring
their
things
to
school
before
monday
as
the
teacher
will
want
to
send
them
off
himself
lippo
agreed
and
was
just
beginning
to
repeat
the
exact
words
of
the
teacher
in
which
he
had
asked
for
contributions
but
he
had
no
chance
to
do
it
kurt
came
running
up
at
this
moment
calling
so
loudly
that
nothing
else
could
possibly
be
heard
mother
i
forgot
to
give
you
a
message
bruno
is
not
coming
home
for
supper
the
rector
is
climbing
high
ems
with
him
and
the
two
other
boys
they
will
only
be
home
at
nine
the
mother
looked
a
little
frightened
are
the
two
others
his
comrades
the
knippel
boys
kurt
assented
i
hope
everything
will
go
well
she
continued
when
those
three
are
together
outside
of
school
they
always
quarrel
when
we
came
here
first
i
was
so
glad
that
bruno
would
have
them
for
friends
but
now
i
am
in
continual
fear
that
they
will
clash
yes
mother
kurt
asserted
you
would
never
have
been
glad
of
that
friendship
if
you
had
really
known
them
wherever
they
can
harm
anybody
they
are
sure
to
do
it
and
always
behind
people
backs
and
bruno
always
is
like
a
loaded
just
a
little
spark
and
he
is
on
fire
and
explodes
it
is
time
to
go
in
said
the
mother
now
taking
the
two
youngest
by
the
hand
kurt
followed
it
had
not
escaped
him
that
an
expression
of
sorrow
had
spread
over
his
mother
face
after
his
words
he
hated
to
see
his
mother
worried
oh
mother
he
said
confidently
there
is
no
reason
for
you
to
be
upset
if
bruno
does
anything
to
them
they
are
sure
to
give
it
back
to
him
in
double
measure
they
do
it
in
a
sneaky
way
because
they
are
afraid
of
him
in
the
open
field
do
you
really
think
that
this
reassures
me
kurt
she
asked
turning
towards
him
kurt
now
realized
that
his
words
could
not
exactly
comfort
his
mother
but
he
felt
that
some
help
should
be
found
for
he
was
always
able
to
discover
such
a
good
side
to
every
evil
that
the
latter
was
swallowed
up
he
saw
an
advantage
now
you
know
mother
when
bruno
has
discharged
his
thunder
it
is
all
over
for
good
then
he
is
like
a
scrubbed
out
all
clean
and
polished
is
that
better
than
if
things
would
keep
sticking
there
mea
standing
at
the
open
window
was
beckoning
to
the
approaching
group
with
lively
gestures
it
meant
that
the
time
for
supper
was
already
overdue
kurt
rushing
to
her
side
informed
her
that
their
mother
meant
to
tell
them
the
story
of
wallerstätten
as
soon
as
everything
was
quiet
that
night
and
the
little
ones
were
put
to
bed
just
mark
now
if
we
wo
hear
about
the
ghost
of
wallerstätten
he
remarked
at
the
end
kurt
was
mistaken
however
everything
was
still
and
quiet
long
ago
the
little
ones
were
in
bed
and
the
last
lessons
were
done
but
bruno
had
not
yet
returned
over
and
over
again
the
mother
looked
at
the
clock
you
must
not
be
afraid
mother
that
they
will
have
a
quarrel
because
the
rector
is
with
them
kurt
said
consolingly
now
rapid
steps
sounded
outside
the
door
was
violently
flung
open
and
bruno
appeared
pale
with
rage
those
two
mean
creatures
those
malicious
rascals
the
sneaky
hypocrites
the
the
bruno
no
more
please
the
mother
interrupted
you
are
beside
yourself
come
sit
down
with
us
and
tell
us
what
happened
as
soon
as
you
feel
more
quiet
but
no
more
such
words
please
it
took
a
considerable
time
before
bruno
could
tell
his
experience
without
breaking
out
again
he
told
them
finally
that
the
rector
had
mentioned
the
castle
of
high
ems
in
their
lessons
that
day
after
asking
his
pupils
if
they
had
ever
inspected
the
famous
ruins
they
had
all
said
no
so
the
rector
invited
the
three
big
boys
to
join
him
in
a
walk
to
see
the
castle
it
was
quite
a
distance
away
and
they
had
examined
the
ruins
very
thoroughly
afterwards
the
rector
had
taken
them
to
a
neighboring
inn
for
a
treat
so
that
it
was
dark
already
when
they
were
walking
down
the
village
street
just
where
the
footpath
which
comes
from
the
large
farmhouse
crosses
the
road
bruno
continued
loneli
came
running
along
with
a
full
in
her
arm
that
scoundrel
edwin
quickly
put
out
his
foot
in
front
of
her
and
loneli
fell
down
her
whole
length
the
milk
bottle
flew
far
off
and
the
milk
poured
down
the
road
like
a
small
white
stream
the
boys
nearly
choked
with
laughter
and
all
i
was
able
to
do
was
to
give
edwin
a
sound
box
on
the
ear
bruno
concluded
nearly
boiling
with
rage
such
a
coward
he
ran
right
off
after
the
rector
who
had
gone
ahead
and
had
not
seen
it
loneli
went
silently
away
crying
to
herself
i
like
to
have
taken
hold
of
both
of
them
and
given
them
proper
yes
and
loneli
is
sure
to
be
scolded
by
her
grandmother
for
having
spilled
the
milk
mea
interrupted
she
always
thinks
that
loneli
is
careless
and
that
it
is
always
her
own
fault
when
somebody
harms
her
she
is
always
punished
for
the
slightest
little
fault
but
she
never
defends
herself
kurt
said
half
in
anger
partly
with
pity
if
those
two
ever
tried
to
harm
clevi
they
would
soon
get
their
faces
scratched
apollonie
has
brought
loneli
up
the
wrong
way
should
you
like
to
see
loneli
jump
at
a
boy
face
and
scratch
it
kurt
asked
the
mother
after
meditating
a
while
kurt
replied
i
guess
i
really
should
do
you
all
like
loneli
because
she
never
gets
rough
and
always
is
friendly
obliging
and
cheerful
her
grandmother
really
loves
her
very
much
but
she
is
a
very
honest
woman
and
worries
about
the
child
just
because
she
is
anxious
to
bring
her
up
well
i
should
be
extremely
sorry
if
she
scolded
loneli
in
the
first
excitement
about
the
spilled
milk
the
boys
should
have
gotten
the
blame
and
i
am
sure
that
apollonie
will
be
sorry
if
she
hears
later
on
what
really
happened
i
quickly
run
over
and
tell
her
about
it
kurt
suggested
the
mother
explained
to
him
however
that
grandmother
and
grandchild
were
probably
fast
asleep
by
that
time
are
we
going
to
have
the
story
of
castle
wildenstein
for
a
finish
now
he
inquired
but
his
mother
had
already
risen
pointing
to
the
wall
clock
and
kurt
saw
that
the
usual
time
for
going
to
bed
had
passed
as
the
following
day
was
a
sunday
he
was
satisfied
they
generally
had
quiet
evenings
then
and
there
would
be
no
interruptions
to
the
story
bruno
too
had
now
calmed
down
it
had
softened
him
that
his
mother
had
found
the
knippel
boys
behaviour
contemptible
and
that
she
had
not
excused
them
in
the
least
he
might
have
told
the
rector
about
it
but
such
accusations
he
despised
he
felt
quite
appeased
since
his
mother
had
shared
his
indignation
and
knew
about
the
matter
soon
the
house
lay
peacefully
slumbering
under
the
fragrant
apple
trees
the
golden
moon
above
was
going
her
way
and
seemed
to
look
down
with
friendly
eyes
as
if
she
was
gratified
that
the
house
which
was
filled
all
day
with
such
noise
and
lively
movement
was
standing
there
so
calm
and
peaceful
chapter
ii
divers
worries
before
the
mother
went
off
to
church
on
sunday
morning
she
always
glanced
into
the
to
see
if
the
children
were
quietly
settled
at
their
different
occupations
and
to
hope
that
everything
would
remain
in
order
during
her
absence
when
she
looked
in
everything
was
peaceful
bruno
and
mea
were
both
sitting
in
a
corner
lost
in
a
book
kurt
had
spread
out
his
drawings
on
a
table
before
him
and
lippo
and
mäzli
were
building
on
their
small
table
a
beautiful
town
with
churches
towers
and
large
palaces
the
mother
was
thoroughly
satisfied
and
went
away
for
awhile
everything
was
still
a
bright
ray
of
sunshine
fell
over
drawing
and
gaily
played
about
on
the
paper
kurt
looking
up
saw
how
the
meadows
were
sparkling
outside
the
two
rascally
from
yesterday
ought
to
be
locked
up
for
the
whole
day
kurt
suddenly
exploded
mea
apparently
had
been
busy
with
the
same
thought
for
she
assented
very
eagerly
the
two
talked
over
the
whole
affair
anew
and
had
to
give
vent
to
their
indignation
about
the
scoundrels
and
their
pity
for
poor
loneli
mäzli
must
have
found
the
conversation
entertaining
for
glancing
over
to
the
others
she
let
lippo
place
the
blocks
whichever
way
he
pleased
something
that
very
seldom
happened
only
when
the
children
said
no
more
she
came
back
to
her
task
goodness
gracious
kurt
exclaimed
suddenly
starting
up
from
his
drawing
you
ought
to
have
reminded
me
mea
that
we
have
to
bring
some
clothes
to
school
for
the
poor
people
whose
houses
were
burnt
up
you
heard
it
but
mother
does
not
even
know
about
it
yet
i
forgot
it
too
said
mea
quietly
continuing
to
read
mother
knows
about
it
long
ago
i
told
her
right
away
lippo
declared
teacher
told
us
to
be
sure
not
to
forget
quite
right
little
school
fox
kurt
replied
while
he
calmly
kept
on
drawing
as
long
as
his
mother
knew
about
the
matter
he
did
not
need
to
bother
any
more
but
the
last
words
had
interested
mäzli
very
much
throwing
together
the
houses
towers
and
churches
she
said
to
lippo
come
lippo
i
know
something
amusing
we
can
do
which
will
please
mama
too
lippo
wondered
what
that
could
be
but
he
first
laid
every
block
neatly
away
in
the
big
box
and
did
not
let
mäzli
hurry
him
in
the
least
do
do
it
that
way
mäzli
called
out
impatiently
throw
them
all
in
and
put
on
the
lid
then
it
all
done
one
must
not
do
that
mäzli
no
one
must
do
it
that
way
lippo
said
seriously
one
ought
to
put
in
the
first
block
and
pack
it
before
one
takes
up
the
second
then
i
wo
wait
for
you
mäzli
declared
rapidly
whisking
out
by
the
door
when
lippo
had
properly
filled
the
box
and
set
it
in
its
right
place
he
quickly
followed
mäzli
wondering
what
her
plan
was
but
he
could
find
her
nowhere
neither
in
the
hall
nor
in
the
garden
and
he
got
no
answer
to
his
loud
repeated
calls
finally
a
reply
came
which
sounded
strangely
muffled
as
if
from
up
above
so
he
went
up
and
into
her
bedroom
there
mäzli
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
a
heap
of
clothes
her
head
thrust
far
into
a
wardrobe
apparently
she
was
still
pulling
out
more
things
you
certainly
are
doing
something
wonderful
said
lippo
glancing
with
his
big
eyes
at
the
clothes
on
the
floor
i
am
doing
the
right
thing
said
mäzli
now
in
the
most
decided
tone
kurt
has
said
that
we
must
send
the
poor
people
some
clothes
so
we
must
take
them
all
out
and
lay
together
everything
we
do
need
any
more
mama
will
be
glad
when
she
has
no
more
to
do
about
it
and
they
can
be
sent
away
now
get
your
things
too
and
we
put
them
all
in
a
heap
the
matter
however
seemed
still
rather
doubtful
to
lippo
standing
thoughtfully
before
all
the
little
skirts
and
jackets
he
felt
that
this
would
not
be
quite
after
his
mother
wish
when
we
want
to
do
something
with
our
clothes
we
always
have
to
ask
mother
he
began
again
but
mäzli
did
not
answer
and
only
pulled
out
a
bunch
of
woolen
stockings
and
a
heavy
winter
cloak
spreading
everything
on
the
floor
no
i
wo
do
it
said
lippo
again
after
scrutinizing
the
unusual
performance
you
do
want
to
do
it
because
you
are
afraid
it
will
be
too
much
work
mäzli
asserted
with
a
face
quite
red
with
zeal
i
help
you
when
i
am
done
here
i
wo
do
it
anyhow
lippo
repeated
resolutely
i
wo
because
we
are
not
allowed
to
mäzli
found
no
time
to
persuade
him
further
as
she
began
to
hunt
for
her
heavy
winter
shoes
which
were
still
in
the
wardrobe
but
before
she
had
brought
them
forth
to
the
light
the
door
opened
and
the
mother
was
looking
full
of
horror
at
the
devastation
but
children
what
a
horrible
disorder
she
cried
out
and
on
sunday
morning
too
what
has
made
you
do
it
what
is
this
wild
shop
on
the
floor
now
you
see
mäzli
said
lippo
not
without
showing
great
satisfaction
at
having
so
clearly
proved
that
he
had
been
in
the
right
mäzli
tried
with
all
her
might
to
prove
to
her
mother
that
her
intention
had
solely
been
to
save
her
the
work
necessary
to
get
the
things
together
but
the
mother
now
explained
decidedly
to
the
little
girl
that
she
never
needed
to
undertake
such
actions
in
the
future
as
she
could
not
possibly
judge
which
clothes
she
still
needed
and
which
could
be
given
away
mäzli
was
also
told
that
such
help
on
her
part
only
resulted
in
double
work
for
her
mother
besides
i
can
see
mäzli
the
mother
concluded
that
your
great
zeal
seems
to
come
from
a
wish
to
get
rid
of
all
the
things
you
do
like
to
wear
yourself
all
your
woolen
things
which
you
always
say
scratch
your
skin
so
you
do
not
mind
if
other
children
have
them
mäzli
they
might
like
them
better
than
to
be
cold
was
mäzli
opinion
oh
mother
knippel
is
coming
up
the
road
toward
our
house
i
am
sure
she
is
coming
to
see
us
said
lippo
who
had
gone
to
the
window
and
i
have
not
even
taken
my
things
off
on
account
of
your
disorder
here
said
the
mother
a
little
frightened
mäzli
go
and
greet
knippel
and
take
her
into
the
front
room
tell
her
that
i
have
just
come
from
church
and
that
i
shall
come
directly
mäzli
ran
joyfully
away
the
errand
seemed
to
please
her
she
received
the
guest
with
excellent
manners
and
led
her
into
the
front
room
to
the
sofa
for
mäzli
knew
exactly
the
way
her
mother
always
did
then
she
gave
her
mother
message
very
well
very
well
and
what
do
you
want
to
do
on
this
beautiful
sunday
the
lady
asked
take
a
walk
mäzli
answered
rapidly
are
they
still
locked
up
she
then
casually
asked
who
who
whom
do
you
mean
and
the
lady
looked
somewhat
disapprovingly
at
the
little
girl
edwin
and
eugen
mäzli
answered
fearlessly
i
should
like
to
know
where
you
get
such
ideas
the
lady
said
with
growing
irritation
i
should
like
to
know
why
the
boys
should
be
locked
up
because
they
are
so
mean
to
loneli
all
the
time
mäzli
declared
the
mother
entered
now
to
her
friendly
greeting
she
only
received
a
very
cold
reply
i
only
wonder
rector
the
guest
began
immediately
in
an
irritated
manner
what
meanness
that
little
of
a
loneli
has
spread
and
invented
about
my
boys
but
i
wonder
still
more
that
some
people
should
believe
such
things
maxa
was
very
much
astonished
that
her
visitor
should
have
already
heard
what
had
taken
place
the
night
before
as
she
knew
that
her
sons
would
not
speak
of
it
of
their
own
free
will
as
long
as
you
know
about
it
already
i
shall
tell
you
what
happened
she
said
you
have
apparently
been
misinformed
it
had
nothing
to
do
whatever
with
a
meanness
on
loneli
part
mäzli
please
join
the
other
children
and
stay
there
till
i
come
the
mother
interrupted
herself
turning
to
the
little
girl
whose
eyes
had
been
expectantly
glued
on
the
visitor
face
in
the
hope
of
hearing
if
the
two
boys
were
still
locked
up
mäzli
walked
away
slowly
still
hoping
that
she
would
hear
the
news
before
she
reached
the
door
but
mäzli
was
doomed
to
be
disappointed
as
no
word
was
spoken
then
maxa
related
the
incident
of
the
evening
before
as
it
occurred
that
is
nothing
at
all
said
the
district
attorney
wife
in
answer
those
are
only
childish
jokes
all
children
hold
out
their
feet
sometimes
to
trip
each
other
such
things
should
not
be
reckoned
as
faults
big
enough
to
scold
children
for
i
do
not
agree
with
you
said
maxa
such
kinds
of
jokes
are
very
much
akin
to
roughness
and
from
small
cruelties
larger
ones
soon
result
loneli
has
really
suffered
harm
from
this
action
and
i
think
that
joking
ceases
under
such
circumstances
as
i
said
it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
of
losing
so
many
words
about
i
feel
decidedly
that
too
much
fuss
is
made
about
the
grandmother
and
the
child
apollonie
does
not
seem
to
get
it
out
of
her
head
that
her
name
was
and
she
carries
her
head
so
high
that
the
child
will
soon
learn
it
from
her
but
i
have
come
to
talk
with
you
about
something
much
more
important
the
visitor
now
gave
her
listener
some
information
that
seemed
to
be
far
from
pleasing
to
maxa
because
the
face
of
the
latter
became
more
and
more
worried
all
the
time
knippel
and
her
husband
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
time
had
come
when
their
sons
should
be
sent
to
the
neighboring
town
in
order
to
enter
the
lowest
classes
of
the
high
school
the
rector
teaching
had
been
sufficient
till
now
but
they
felt
that
the
boys
had
outgrown
him
and
belonged
to
a
more
advanced
school
so
they
had
decided
to
find
a
good
boarding
place
for
the
three
boys
together
as
bruno
would
naturally
join
them
in
order
that
they
could
remain
together
since
the
three
would
in
later
years
have
great
authority
in
the
little
community
it
would
be
splendid
if
they
were
educated
alike
and
could
agree
thoroughly
in
everything
my
husband
means
to
go
to
town
in
the
near
future
and
look
for
a
suitable
house
where
they
can
board
the
speaker
concluded
i
am
sure
that
you
will
be
grateful
if
the
question
is
solved
for
bruno
as
you
would
otherwise
be
obliged
to
settle
it
yourself
frau
maxa
heart
was
very
heavy
at
this
news
she
already
saw
the
consequences
and
pictured
the
terrible
scenes
that
would
result
if
the
three
boys
were
obliged
to
live
closely
together
the
thought
of
sending
bruno
away
from
home
already
troubles
me
greatly
she
said
finally
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
for
it
our
rector
who
has
offered
to
teach
them
out
of
pure
kindness
means
to
keep
the
boys
under
his
care
till
a
year
from
next
spring
they
are
able
to
learn
plenty
still
from
him
however
if
you
have
resolved
to
send
your
sons
away
i
shall
be
obliged
to
do
the
same
as
the
rector
could
not
continue
the
lessons
for
bruno
alone
maxa
declined
the
offer
of
her
visitor
to
look
up
a
for
bruno
as
she
had
to
talk
the
matter
over
first
with
her
brother
he
was
always
her
counsellor
in
these
things
because
he
was
the
children
guardian
the
district
attorney
wife
did
not
seem
gratified
with
this
information
as
she
was
anxious
to
have
the
matter
settled
then
and
there
she
remarked
rather
sarcastically
that
a
mother
should
be
able
to
decide
such
matters
alone
the
boys
are
sensible
enough
to
behave
properly
without
being
constantly
watched
she
added
i
can
certainly
say
that
mine
are
and
where
two
hold
to
the
right
path
a
third
is
sure
to
follow
my
eldest
is
never
one
to
follow
blindly
maxa
said
with
animation
i
should
not
wish
it
either
in
this
case
i
shall
keep
him
at
home
as
long
as
it
is
possible
for
me
and
after
that
i
shall
send
him
away
under
god
protection
just
as
you
say
the
other
lady
uttered
rising
and
taking
leave
we
can
talk
the
question
of
boarding
over
again
another
time
she
remarked
as
she
was
going
away
when
the
time
comes
my
husband
preparation
for
the
future
will
be
welcome
i
am
sure
when
the
mother
after
escorting
her
guest
came
back
to
the
room
mäzli
immediately
called
out
did
she
say
if
the
two
are
still
locked
up
what
are
you
inventing
mäzli
said
the
mother
you
probably
know
yourself
what
it
means
oh
yes
i
know
mäzli
assured
her
i
asked
her
if
the
boys
were
still
locked
up
because
kurt
said
that
kurt
laughed
out
loud
oh
you
naughty
child
to
talk
so
wild
because
i
say
that
those
two
ought
to
be
locked
up
mäzli
runs
over
and
immediately
asks
their
mother
that
question
maxa
now
understood
clearly
where
her
visitor
had
heard
about
her
boy
behaviour
of
yesterday
mäzli
she
said
admonishingly
have
you
forgotten
that
you
are
not
to
ask
questions
of
people
who
come
to
see
me
but
why
should
i
ask
what
the
children
are
doing
mäzli
declared
feigning
great
pity
in
her
voice
now
the
foxy
little
thing
wants
to
incline
mother
to
be
comforted
by
pretending
to
pity
them
kurt
declared
suddenly
a
terrific
shout
of
joy
sounded
from
all
voices
at
once
as
they
all
called
uncle
phipp
uncle
phipp
in
a
moment
they
had
disappeared
through
the
door
kurt
jumped
out
through
the
window
which
was
not
dangerous
for
him
and
was
the
shortest
way
to
the
street
the
mother
also
ran
outside
to
greet
uncle
phipp
who
was
her
only
brother
he
lived
on
his
estate
in
sils
valley
which
was
famous
for
its
fruit
he
was
always
the
most
welcome
guest
in
his
sister
house
he
had
been
away
on
a
journey
and
had
not
made
his
appearance
for
several
weeks
in
nolla
and
his
coming
was
therefore
greeted
with
special
enthusiasm
one
could
hardly
guess
that
there
was
an
uncle
in
the
midst
of
the
mass
which
was
moving
forward
and
taking
up
the
whole
breadth
of
the
road
the
five
children
were
hanging
on
to
him
on
all
sides
in
such
a
way
that
it
looked
as
if
one
solid
person
was
walking
along
on
many
feet
maxa
i
have
no
hand
for
you
as
you
can
see
the
brother
saluted
her
i
greet
you
heartily
though
with
my
head
which
i
can
still
nod
no
i
want
to
have
your
hand
maxa
replied
lippo
can
let
your
right
hand
go
for
a
moment
how
are
you
philip
welcome
home
did
you
have
a
pleasant
journey
and
did
you
find
what
you
were
looking
for
all
has
gone
to
my
greatest
satisfaction
forward
now
young
people
because
i
want
to
take
off
my
overcoat
the
uncle
commanded
it
is
filled
with
heavy
objects
which
might
pull
me
to
the
ground
shouting
with
joy
the
five
now
pushed
their
uncle
into
the
house
they
had
all
secretly
guessed
what
the
heavy
objects
in
his
long
pockets
were
when
the
uncle
had
reached
the
house
he
insisted
on
taking
off
his
coat
alone
in
order
to
prevent
the
things
from
being
hurt
he
had
to
hang
it
up
because
the
mother
insisted
that
they
should
go
to
lunch
and
postpone
everything
else
till
the
afternoon
the
next
difficult
and
important
question
to
be
settled
was
who
should
be
allowed
to
sit
beside
uncle
philip
at
dinner
because
those
next
had
the
best
chance
to
talk
to
him
he
chose
the
youngest
two
leading
him
in
triumph
to
the
table
they
placed
him
in
their
midst
with
joyfully
sparkling
eyes
it
was
a
merry
meal
the
children
were
allowed
to
ask
him
all
they
wanted
to
and
he
told
them
so
many
amusing
things
about
his
travels
that
they
could
never
get
weary
of
listening
last
of
all
the
good
things
came
the
sunday
cake
and
when
that
was
eaten
mäzli
showed
great
signs
of
impatience
as
if
the
best
of
all
were
still
to
come
i
think
that
mäzli
has
noticed
something
said
the
uncle
and
one
must
never
let
such
a
small
and
inquisitive
nose
point
into
empty
air
for
too
long
we
must
look
now
what
my
overcoat
has
brought
back
from
the
ship
mäzli
who
had
already
jumped
up
from
her
chair
seized
her
uncle
hand
as
soon
as
he
rose
she
wanted
to
be
as
close
to
him
as
possible
while
he
was
emptying
the
two
deep
pockets
what
lovely
red
books
came
out
first
he
presented
them
to
bruno
and
kurt
who
appeared
extremely
pleased
with
their
presents
this
is
for
mother
for
her
mending
mäzli
called
out
looking
with
suspense
at
her
uncle
fingers
he
was
just
pulling
out
a
dainty
little
sewing
case
you
guessed
wrong
that
time
mäzli
he
said
your
mother
gets
a
present
too
but
this
is
for
mea
who
is
getting
to
be
a
young
lady
she
will
soon
visit
her
friends
with
the
sewing
case
under
her
arm
oh
how
lovely
uncle
how
lovely
mea
cried
out
altogether
enchanted
with
her
gift
i
wish
you
had
brought
some
friends
for
me
with
you
they
are
hard
enough
to
find
here
i
promise
to
do
that
another
time
mea
there
was
no
more
room
for
them
in
my
overcoat
but
now
comes
the
most
important
thing
of
all
and
with
these
words
the
uncle
pulled
a
large
box
out
of
each
pocket
these
are
for
the
small
people
he
said
but
do
not
mix
them
up
in
one
are
stamping
little
horses
and
in
the
other
little
steaming
pots
which
is
for
mäzli
the
stamping
horses
she
said
quickly
i
do
think
so
take
it
now
and
look
said
the
uncle
when
lippo
had
received
his
box
also
the
two
ran
over
to
their
table
but
mäzli
suddenly
paused
uncle
philip
she
asked
eagerly
has
mother
gotten
something
too
something
nice
can
i
see
it
yes
something
very
nice
the
uncle
answered
but
she
has
not
gotten
it
yet
one
ca
see
it
but
one
can
hear
it
oh
a
piano
mäzli
guessed
quickly
no
no
mäzli
you
might
see
as
much
as
that
said
the
uncle
you
could
possibly
guess
it
it
ca
come
out
till
all
the
small
birds
are
tucked
into
their
nests
and
everything
is
still
and
quiet
mäzli
ran
to
her
table
at
last
and
when
she
found
a
perfect
array
of
shining
copper
kettles
cooking
pans
and
pots
in
her
box
she
forgot
completely
about
the
horses
she
dug
with
growing
astonishment
into
her
box
which
seemed
to
be
filled
with
ever
new
and
more
marvellous
objects
lippo
was
standing
up
his
beautifully
saddled
horses
in
front
of
him
but
the
thing
he
liked
best
of
all
was
a
groom
in
a
red
jacket
he
put
him
first
on
one
horse
and
then
on
all
the
others
for
to
the
boy
great
delight
he
fitted
into
every
saddle
he
sat
secure
straight
and
immovable
even
when
the
horses
trotted
or
galloped
uncle
philip
was
less
able
to
stand
the
quiet
which
was
reigning
after
the
presentation
of
his
gifts
than
were
the
children
who
were
completely
lost
in
the
new
marvels
he
told
them
now
that
he
was
ready
to
take
them
all
on
a
walk
mäzli
was
ready
before
anyone
because
she
had
thrown
everything
into
her
box
and
then
with
a
little
pushing
had
been
able
to
put
on
the
lid
this
did
not
worry
her
further
so
she
ran
towards
the
uncle
mäzli
you
must
do
that
no
you
must
lippo
called
after
her
but
the
little
girl
stood
already
outside
holding
her
uncle
hand
ready
for
the
march
everybody
else
was
ready
as
they
all
had
only
had
one
object
to
put
away
and
the
mother
gave
her
orders
to
kathy
the
cook
come
lippo
do
stay
behind
the
uncle
called
into
the
room
i
have
to
finish
first
then
i
come
right
away
the
little
boy
called
back
the
mother
was
ready
to
go
too
now
where
is
lippo
she
asked
examining
her
little
brood
he
sits
in
there
like
a
mole
in
his
hole
and
wo
come
out
said
kurt
shall
i
fetch
him
he
come
quickly
enough
then
no
no
the
mother
returned
i
attend
to
it
lippo
was
sitting
at
his
little
table
laying
one
horse
after
the
other
slowly
and
carefully
in
the
box
so
that
they
should
not
be
damaged
come
lippo
come
we
must
not
let
uncle
philip
wait
the
mother
said
but
mother
one
must
not
leave
before
everything
is
straightened
up
and
put
into
the
wardrobe
lippo
said
timidly
one
must
always
pack
up
properly
that
is
true
but
i
shall
help
you
said
the
mother
and
with
her
assistance
everything
was
soon
put
in
order
oh
here
comes
the
at
last
kurt
cried
out
no
you
must
not
scold
him
for
lippo
did
right
in
putting
his
things
in
order
before
taking
a
walk
said
his
mother
who
had
herself
given
him
that
injunction
bravo
my
i
taught
you
that
but
now
we
must
start
said
the
uncle
extending
his
hand
to
the
little
boy
where
shall
we
go
up
to
the
castle
kurt
quickly
suggested
everybody
was
satisfied
with
the
plan
and
the
mother
assented
eagerly
as
she
had
intended
the
same
thing
we
shall
go
up
towards
the
castle
hill
the
uncle
remarked
as
he
set
out
after
taking
the
two
little
ones
by
the
hand
we
shall
have
to
go
around
the
castle
wo
we
if
cross
trius
is
keeping
watch
we
wo
get
very
close
to
it
because
the
property
is
fenced
in
for
a
long
way
around
oh
we
can
go
up
on
the
road
to
the
entrance
said
kurt
with
animation
we
can
look
into
the
garden
from
there
but
everything
is
overgrown
on
the
right
is
a
wooden
fence
which
we
can
easily
climb
from
there
we
can
run
all
the
way
up
through
the
meadows
to
a
thick
hawthorn
hedge
on
the
other
side
of
that
begin
the
bushes
and
behind
that
the
woods
with
the
old
fir
and
pine
trees
but
we
ca
climb
over
it
we
could
easily
enough
get
to
the
castle
from
the
woods
you
seem
to
have
a
very
minute
knowledge
of
the
place
said
the
uncle
what
does
trius
say
to
the
climbing
of
hedges
in
the
meadows
there
are
beautiful
as
far
as
i
remember
he
beats
everybody
he
can
catch
was
kurt
information
even
if
they
have
no
intention
of
taking
the
apples
whenever
he
sees
anyone
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
hedge
he
begins
to
strike
out
at
them
his
intention
is
probably
to
show
everybody
who
tries
to
nose
around
that
the
fences
are
not
to
be
climbed
let
us
wait
for
your
mother
who
knows
all
the
little
ways
she
will
tell
us
where
to
go
uncle
philip
glanced
back
for
his
sister
who
had
remained
behind
with
mea
and
bruno
while
the
uncle
was
amusing
the
younger
ones
the
two
others
were
eagerly
talking
over
their
special
problems
with
her
so
that
they
got
ahead
very
slowly
to
which
side
shall
we
go
now
as
you
know
the
way
so
well
please
tell
us
where
to
go
said
the
uncle
when
the
three
had
approached
the
mother
replied
that
uncle
philip
knew
the
paths
as
well
as
she
if
not
even
better
as
long
as
the
decision
lay
with
her
however
she
chose
the
height
to
the
left
from
which
there
was
a
clear
view
of
the
castle
then
we
pass
by
apollonie
cottage
said
kurt
i
am
glad
then
we
can
see
what
loneli
is
doing
after
yesterday
trouble
she
is
the
nicest
child
in
school
let
us
go
there
the
uncle
assented
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
my
old
friend
apollonie
again
march
ahead
now
they
had
soon
reached
the
cottage
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
which
lay
bathed
in
brilliant
sunshine
only
the
old
in
the
corner
threw
a
shadow
over
the
wooden
bench
beneath
it
and
over
a
part
of
the
little
garden
grandmother
and
grandchild
were
sitting
on
the
bench
dressed
in
their
and
with
a
book
on
their
knees
a
delicious
perfume
of
rosemary
and
mignonette
filled
the
air
from
the
little
uncle
philip
looked
over
the
top
of
the
hedge
into
the
garden
real
sunday
peace
is
resting
on
everything
here
just
look
maxa
he
called
out
to
his
sister
look
at
the
and
the
mignonette
how
pleasant
and
charming
apollonie
looks
in
her
spotless
cap
and
shining
apron
with
the
child
beside
her
in
her
pretty
dress
loneli
had
just
noticed
her
best
friends
and
jumping
up
from
the
bench
she
ran
to
them
apollonie
glancing
up
now
recognized
the
company
too
radiant
she
approached
and
invited
them
to
step
into
her
garden
for
a
rest
she
was
already
opening
the
door
in
order
to
fetch
out
enough
chairs
and
benches
to
seat
them
all
when
maxa
stopped
her
she
told
apollonie
that
their
time
was
already
very
short
as
they
intended
to
climb
the
hill
but
they
had
wished
to
greet
her
on
their
way
up
and
to
see
her
garden
how
attractively
it
is
laid
out
mrs
apollonie
uncle
philip
exclaimed
this
small
space
is
as
lovely
as
the
large
used
to
be
your
roses
and
mignonette
the
cabbage
beans
and
beets
the
little
fountain
in
the
corner
are
so
charming
your
bench
under
the
looks
most
inviting
oh
falcon
you
are
still
as
fond
of
joking
as
ever
apollonie
returned
so
you
think
that
my
are
as
fine
as
those
up
there
used
to
be
indeed
who
has
ever
seen
the
like
of
them
or
of
my
wonderful
vegetable
garden
in
the
there
has
never
been
such
an
abundance
of
cauliflower
and
peas
such
rows
of
such
what
a
delight
their
care
was
to
me
such
a
garden
will
never
be
seen
again
i
have
to
sigh
every
time
when
i
think
that
anything
so
beautiful
should
be
forever
lost
but
that
ca
be
helped
uncle
philip
answered
there
is
one
great
advantage
you
have
here
nobody
can
possibly
disturb
your
sunday
peace
you
need
not
throw
up
your
hands
and
exclaim
is
the
worst
of
all
oh
falcon
so
you
still
remember
apollonie
exclaimed
yes
i
must
admit
that
the
three
young
gentlemen
have
trampled
down
many
a
young
plant
of
mine
still
i
should
not
mind
such
a
thing
if
i
only
had
the
care
of
the
garden
back
again
but
it
does
even
exist
any
more
trius
only
harvest
is
hay
and
apples
and
that
is
all
he
wants
apparently
because
he
has
thrown
everything
else
out
please
do
not
think
that
i
am
swimming
in
pure
peace
here
because
no
boys
are
stamping
down
my
garden
oh
no
it
is
very
difficult
to
read
my
sunday
psalm
in
peace
when
i
am
given
such
a
bitter
soup
of
grief
to
swallow
as
i
got
yesterday
it
keeps
on
burning
me
and
still
i
have
to
swallow
it
you
probably
mean
the
from
yesterday
kurt
interrupted
full
of
lively
interest
loneli
had
only
just
told
him
that
things
had
gone
very
badly
the
day
before
when
she
had
returned
home
all
soiled
from
her
fall
and
with
the
empty
so
he
felt
more
indignant
than
before
and
had
immediately
interpreted
apollonie
hint
i
want
to
tell
you
apollonie
that
it
was
not
loneli
fault
in
the
least
those
rascals
enjoy
sticking
out
their
feet
and
seeing
people
tumble
over
them
the
child
ca
possibly
have
behaved
properly
kurt
or
the
district
attorney
sons
would
not
have
teased
her
i
fetch
bruno
right
away
and
he
prove
to
you
that
loneli
did
nothing
whatever
he
saw
it
kurt
cried
eagerly
with
the
intention
of
fetching
his
brother
who
had
already
started
up
the
hill
but
his
mother
detained
him
it
was
not
her
wish
to
fan
bruno
rage
afresh
by
the
discovery
that
loneli
had
been
considered
guilty
she
therefore
narrated
the
incident
to
apollonie
just
as
bruno
had
reported
it
loneli
blue
eyes
glistened
with
joy
when
the
story
was
told
according
to
the
truth
she
knew
that
the
words
spoken
by
the
rector
widow
had
great
weight
with
her
grandmother
can
you
see
now
that
it
was
not
loneli
fault
kurt
cried
out
as
soon
as
his
mother
had
finished
yes
i
see
it
and
i
am
happy
that
it
is
so
said
apollonie
how
could
one
have
suspected
that
boys
who
had
a
good
education
should
want
to
hurt
others
without
cause
the
young
falcon
would
never
have
done
such
a
thing
i
know
that
he
only
ran
into
the
vegetable
garden
because
his
two
friends
were
chasing
him
from
both
sides
uncle
philip
laughed
i
am
glad
you
are
so
just
to
me
apollonie
even
when
you
scolded
the
falcon
properly
for
tramping
down
your
plants
you
knew
that
it
was
not
in
maliciousness
he
did
it
but
in
i
am
afraid
it
is
time
to
go
now
and
with
these
words
he
heartily
shook
his
old
acquaintance
by
the
hand
the
two
little
ones
who
had
never
left
his
side
were
ready
immediately
to
strike
out
once
more
they
soon
reached
the
hill
and
the
castle
which
was
bathed
in
the
soft
evening
light
lay
openly
before
them
a
hushed
silence
reigned
about
the
gray
building
and
the
old
pine
trees
under
the
tower
whose
branches
lay
trailing
on
the
ground
for
years
no
human
hand
had
touched
them
where
the
blooming
garden
had
been
wild
bushes
and
weeds
covered
the
ground
the
mother
and
uncle
settling
down
on
a
looked
in
silence
towards
the
castle
while
the
children
were
hunting
for
strawberries
on
the
sunny
incline
how
terribly
deserted
and
lonely
it
all
looks
uncle
philip
said
after
a
while
let
us
go
back
when
the
sun
is
gone
it
will
get
more
dreary
still
do
you
notice
anything
philip
asked
his
sister
taken
up
with
her
own
thoughts
can
you
see
that
all
the
shutters
are
closed
except
those
on
the
tower
balcony
do
you
remember
who
used
to
live
there
certainly
i
do
mad
bruno
used
to
live
there
the
brother
answered
as
his
rooms
alone
seem
to
be
kept
in
order
he
might
come
back
why
he
never
come
back
uncle
philip
exclaimed
you
know
that
we
heard
ages
ago
that
he
is
an
entirely
broken
man
and
that
he
lay
deadly
sick
in
malaga
tillman
who
went
to
spain
must
certainly
know
about
it
restless
baron
bruno
has
probably
found
his
last
long
ago
why
should
you
look
for
him
here
i
only
think
that
in
that
case
a
new
owner
of
the
place
would
have
turned
up
by
now
was
his
sister
opinion
two
young
members
of
the
family
the
children
of
salo
and
eleanor
are
still
alive
i
wonder
where
these
children
are
they
would
be
the
sole
owners
after
their
uncle
death
they
have
long
ago
been
disinherited
the
brother
exclaimed
i
do
not
know
where
they
are
but
i
have
an
idea
on
that
subject
i
shall
tell
you
about
it
when
we
are
alone
here
you
are
so
you
throw
worried
looks
in
all
directions
as
if
you
were
afraid
that
this
perfectly
solid
meadow
were
a
dangerous
pond
into
which
your
little
brood
might
fall
and
lose
their
lives
the
children
had
scattered
in
all
directions
bruno
had
gone
far
to
one
side
and
was
deeply
immersed
in
a
little
book
he
had
taken
with
him
mea
had
discovered
the
most
beautiful
she
had
ever
seen
in
all
her
life
which
grew
in
large
masses
beside
the
gurgling
mountain
stream
beside
herself
with
transport
she
flew
from
place
to
place
where
the
small
blue
flowers
sparkled
for
she
wanted
to
pick
them
all
kurt
had
climbed
a
tree
and
from
the
highest
branch
he
could
reach
was
searchingly
studying
the
castle
as
if
something
special
was
to
be
discovered
there
mäzli
having
discovered
some
strawberries
had
pulled
lippo
along
with
her
she
wanted
him
to
pick
those
she
had
found
while
she
hunted
for
more
in
the
meantime
the
mother
was
very
busy
keeping
an
eye
on
them
all
kurt
might
become
too
daring
in
his
climbing
feats
mäzli
might
run
away
too
far
and
lippo
might
put
his
strawberries
into
his
as
he
had
done
once
already
and
cause
great
harm
to
his
little
sunday
suit
you
fuss
and
worry
too
much
about
the
children
uncle
philip
said
just
let
the
children
simply
grow
saying
to
them
once
in
a
while
you
do
behave
you
be
locked
up
yes
that
certainly
sounds
simple
said
his
sister
it
is
a
pity
you
have
no
brood
of
your
own
to
bring
up
philip
as
lively
as
mine
and
each
child
entirely
different
from
the
others
so
that
one
has
to
be
urged
to
a
thing
that
another
has
to
be
kept
from
i
get
the
cares
without
looking
for
them
a
new
great
worry
has
come
to
me
which
even
you
wo
be
able
to
just
push
aside
maxa
told
her
brother
now
about
the
morning
interview
with
the
wife
of
the
district
attorney
she
told
him
of
the
problem
she
had
with
bruno
further
education
because
the
lessons
he
had
been
having
from
the
rector
would
end
in
the
fall
and
of
her
firm
intention
of
keeping
him
from
living
together
with
his
two
present
comrades
the
three
had
never
yet
come
together
without
bringing
as
a
result
some
mean
deed
on
one
side
and
an
explosion
of
rage
on
the
other
do
you
think
philip
that
it
will
be
a
great
care
for
me
to
think
that
the
three
are
living
under
one
roof
do
you
think
so
yourself
maxa
concluded
oh
maxa
that
is
an
old
story
there
have
been
boys
at
all
times
who
fought
together
and
then
made
peace
again
philip
that
does
not
console
me
the
sister
answered
that
has
never
been
bruno
way
at
all
he
never
fights
that
way
but
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
he
might
do
in
a
fit
of
anger
at
some
injustice
or
meanness
and
that
is
what
frightens
me
so
his
godfather
of
the
same
name
has
probably
passed
that
on
to
him
nobody
more
than
you
maxa
has
always
tried
to
wash
him
clean
and
excuse
him
for
all
his
deeds
of
anger
in
your
indestructible
admiration
uncle
philip
got
no
further
as
all
the
children
now
came
running
toward
them
the
two
little
ones
both
tried
hard
to
put
the
biggest
strawberries
they
had
found
into
the
mouths
of
their
mother
and
uncle
mea
could
not
hold
her
magnificent
bunch
of
near
enough
to
their
eyes
to
be
admired
the
two
older
boys
had
approached
too
as
they
had
an
announcement
to
make
the
sun
had
gone
down
behind
the
mountain
so
they
had
remembered
that
it
was
time
to
go
home
mother
and
uncle
rose
from
their
seats
and
the
whole
group
started
down
the
mountainside
the
two
little
ones
were
gaily
trotting
beside
the
uncle
bursting
into
wild
shouting
now
and
then
for
he
made
such
leaps
that
they
flew
high
into
the
air
sometimes
he
held
them
so
firmly
however
that
they
always
reached
the
ground
safely
at
the
entrance
to
the
house
kurt
had
a
brilliant
idea
oh
mother
he
called
out
excitedly
over
the
prospect
tonight
we
must
have
the
story
of
the
wallerstätten
family
it
will
fit
so
well
because
we
were
able
to
see
the
castle
today
with
all
its
gables
embrasures
and
battlements
but
the
mother
answered
i
am
sorry
to
say
we
ca
uncle
is
here
today
and
as
he
has
to
leave
early
tomorrow
morning
i
have
to
talk
to
him
tonight
you
have
to
go
to
bed
early
otherwise
you
will
be
too
tired
to
get
up
tomorrow
after
your
long
walk
oh
what
a
shame
what
a
shame
kurt
lamented
he
was
still
hoping
that
he
would
find
out
something
in
the
story
about
the
ghost
of
wildenstein
despite
the
fact
that
one
could
not
really
believe
in
him
sitting
on
the
tree
that
afternoon
he
had
been
lost
in
speculations
as
to
where
the
ghost
might
have
appeared
when
the
mother
went
to
mäzli
bed
that
night
to
say
prayers
with
her
she
found
her
still
very
much
excited
as
usual
by
the
happenings
of
the
day
she
always
found
it
difficult
to
quiet
the
little
girl
but
she
seemed
filled
by
very
vivid
impressions
now
that
everything
was
still
they
seemed
to
come
back
to
her
mäzli
sat
straight
up
in
her
bed
with
shining
eyes
as
soon
as
her
mother
appeared
why
was
the
allowed
to
spoil
apollonie
sunday
peace
she
cried
out
where
have
you
heard
that
mäzli
the
mother
said
quite
frightened
she
already
saw
the
moment
before
her
when
mäzli
would
tell
the
district
attorney
wife
that
new
appellation
you
must
never
use
that
expression
any
more
mäzli
you
see
nobody
would
be
able
to
know
what
you
mean
kurt
invented
it
apparently
when
apollonie
spoke
about
having
so
much
to
swallow
he
should
not
have
said
it
do
you
understand
mäzli
that
you
must
not
say
it
any
more
yes
but
why
is
anyone
allowed
to
spoil
apollonie
sunday
peace
mäzli
persevered
apollonie
was
her
special
friend
whom
she
wanted
to
keep
from
harm
no
one
should
do
it
mäzli
the
mother
replied
it
is
wrong
to
spoil
anybody
sunday
peace
and
no
one
should
do
it
but
our
good
god
should
quickly
call
down
do
it
do
do
it
then
they
would
know
that
they
were
not
allowed
was
mäzli
opinion
he
does
it
mäzli
he
does
it
every
time
anybody
does
wrong
said
the
mother
for
the
always
hears
such
a
voice
that
calls
out
to
him
do
it
do
do
it
but
sometimes
he
does
it
in
spite
of
the
voice
even
young
children
like
you
mäzli
hear
the
voice
when
they
feel
like
doing
wrong
and
they
do
wrong
just
the
same
i
only
wonder
why
god
does
not
punish
them
right
away
he
ought
to
do
that
mäzli
eagerly
replied
but
he
does
said
the
mother
as
soon
as
anybody
has
done
wrong
he
feels
a
great
weight
on
his
heart
so
that
he
keeps
on
thinking
wish
i
had
done
it
then
our
good
god
is
good
and
merciful
to
him
and
does
not
punish
him
further
he
gives
him
plenty
of
time
to
come
to
him
and
tell
him
how
sorry
he
is
to
have
done
wrong
god
gives
him
the
chance
to
beg
his
pardon
but
if
he
does
not
do
that
he
is
sure
to
be
punished
so
that
he
will
do
more
and
more
evil
and
become
more
terribly
unhappy
all
the
time
i
look
out
too
now
if
i
can
hear
the
voice
was
resolution
the
chief
thing
is
to
follow
the
voice
mäzli
said
the
mother
but
we
must
be
quiet
now
say
your
prayers
darling
then
you
will
soon
go
to
sleep
mäzli
said
her
little
prayer
very
devoutly
as
there
was
nothing
more
to
trouble
her
she
lay
down
and
was
half
asleep
as
soon
as
her
mother
closed
the
door
behind
her
she
was
still
expected
at
four
other
little
beds
every
one
of
the
children
had
a
problem
to
bring
to
her
but
there
was
so
little
time
left
that
they
had
to
be
put
off
till
in
fact
they
were
all
glad
to
make
a
little
sacrifice
for
their
beloved
uncle
when
she
came
back
into
the
room
she
found
him
hurrying
impatiently
up
and
down
he
could
hardly
wait
to
make
his
sister
the
announcement
to
which
he
had
already
referred
several
times
are
you
coming
at
last
he
called
to
her
are
you
not
a
bit
curious
what
present
i
have
brought
you
oh
philip
i
am
sure
it
can
only
be
a
joke
maxa
replied
i
should
love
to
know
what
you
meant
when
you
spoke
of
the
children
of
wallerstätten
it
happens
to
be
one
and
the
same
thing
the
brother
replied
come
here
now
and
sit
down
beside
me
and
get
your
right
away
so
that
you
wo
have
to
jump
up
again
i
know
you
you
will
probably
run
off
two
or
three
times
to
the
children
no
philip
is
sunday
and
i
wo
mend
the
children
are
all
sleeping
peacefully
so
please
tell
me
about
it
uncle
philip
sat
down
quietly
beside
his
sister
and
began
as
surely
as
i
am
now
sitting
here
beside
you
maxa
so
surely
young
leonore
of
wallerstätten
was
sitting
beside
me
three
days
ago
i
am
really
as
sure
as
anything
that
it
was
leonore
child
she
is
only
an
hour
distance
away
from
you
and
is
probably
going
to
stay
in
this
neighborhood
for
a
few
weeks
i
wanted
to
bring
you
this
news
as
a
present
maxa
first
could
not
say
a
word
from
astonishment
are
you
quite
sure
philip
she
asked
wishing
for
an
affirmation
how
could
you
become
so
sure
that
the
child
you
saw
was
leonore
little
daughter
first
of
all
because
nobody
who
has
known
leonore
can
ever
forget
what
she
looked
like
the
child
is
exactly
like
her
and
looks
at
one
just
the
way
leonore
used
to
do
secondly
the
child
name
was
leonore
too
thirdly
she
had
the
same
brown
curls
rippling
down
her
shoulders
that
her
mother
had
and
she
spoke
with
a
voice
as
soft
and
charming
for
the
fifth
and
sixth
reasons
because
only
leonore
could
have
such
a
child
for
there
could
not
be
two
people
like
her
in
the
whole
world
uncle
philip
had
grown
very
warm
during
these
ardent
proofs
please
tell
me
exactly
where
and
how
you
saw
the
child
the
sister
urged
so
the
brother
related
how
he
had
come
back
three
days
ago
from
a
trip
and
arriving
in
town
had
given
orders
in
the
hotel
for
a
carriage
to
be
brought
round
to
take
him
back
to
sils
that
same
evening
the
host
had
then
informed
him
that
two
ladies
had
just
ordered
a
carriage
to
take
them
to
the
same
destination
he
thought
that
as
long
as
they
had
seemed
to
be
strangers
and
were
anxious
to
know
more
about
the
road
they
would
be
very
glad
to
have
a
companion
who
was
going
the
same
way
so
the
host
had
made
all
necessary
arrangements
as
there
were
no
objections
to
the
plan
on
either
side
when
the
carriage
had
driven
up
he
had
seen
that
the
ladies
had
with
them
a
little
daughter
who
was
to
occupy
the
of
the
carriage
this
daughter
as
i
thought
was
leonore
child
i
am
as
certain
of
that
as
of
my
relation
with
you
the
brother
concluded
maxa
was
filled
with
great
excitement
could
one
of
the
children
for
whom
she
had
vainly
longed
and
inquired
for
such
long
years
be
really
so
near
her
would
she
be
able
to
see
her
who
were
the
ladies
to
whom
she
belonged
to
all
her
various
questions
the
brother
could
only
answer
that
the
ladies
with
whom
leonore
was
living
came
from
the
neighborhood
of
hannover
they
had
taken
a
little
villa
in
sils
on
the
mountain
which
they
had
seen
advertised
for
the
summer
months
he
had
shown
the
ladies
his
estate
in
sils
and
had
offered
to
serve
them
in
whatever
way
they
wished
then
they
had
taken
leave
leonore
name
had
wakened
so
many
happy
memories
of
her
beautiful
childhood
and
youth
in
maxa
that
she
began
to
revive
those
times
with
her
brother
and
tirelessly
talked
of
the
days
they
had
spent
there
together
with
her
unforgettable
friend
leonore
and
her
two
cousins
the
brother
seemed
just
as
ready
to
indulge
in
those
delightful
memories
as
she
was
and
whenever
she
ceased
he
began
again
to
talk
of
all
the
unusual
happenings
and
exploits
that
had
taken
place
with
their
dear
friends
do
you
know
maxa
i
think
we
had
much
better
playmates
than
your
children
have
he
said
finally
if
bruno
beats
his
comrades
i
like
it
better
than
if
he
acted
as
they
do
brother
and
sister
had
not
talked
so
far
into
the
night
for
a
long
time
nevertheless
maxa
could
not
get
to
sleep
for
hours
afterwards
leonore
image
with
the
long
brown
curls
and
the
winning
expression
in
her
eyes
woke
her
lively
desire
to
see
the
child
that
resembled
her
so
much
chapter
iii
castle
wildenstein
when
mäzli
and
lippo
were
neatly
washed
and
dressed
the
next
morning
they
came
downstairs
to
the
chattering
in
the
most
lively
manner
mäzli
was
just
telling
lippo
her
plans
for
the
afternoon
when
he
should
be
back
from
school
the
mother
after
attending
to
some
task
followed
the
children
who
were
standing
around
the
piano
as
soon
as
she
entered
kurt
broke
out
into
a
frightened
cry
oh
mother
we
have
forgotten
all
about
the
poor
people
whose
houses
burnt
down
and
we
were
supposed
to
take
the
things
with
us
this
morning
yes
the
teacher
told
us
twice
that
we
must
not
forget
it
lippo
complained
but
i
did
forget
it
do
worry
children
i
have
attended
to
it
said
the
mother
kathy
has
just
gone
to
the
school
with
a
basket
full
of
things
it
was
too
heavy
for
you
to
carry
oh
how
nice
and
convenient
it
is
to
have
a
mother
kurt
said
quite
relieved
the
mother
sat
down
at
the
piano
come
let
us
sing
our
morning
song
now
she
said
we
ca
wait
for
uncle
because
he
might
come
back
too
late
from
his
walk
opening
the
book
she
began
to
sing
the
golden
sun
with
joy
and
fun
the
children
taking
up
the
melody
sang
it
briskly
for
they
knew
it
well
mäzli
was
singing
full
of
zeal
too
and
wherever
she
had
forgotten
the
words
she
did
not
stop
but
made
up
some
of
her
own
two
stanzas
had
been
sung
when
kurt
said
we
must
stop
now
or
it
will
get
too
late
after
breakfast
it
is
time
to
go
to
school
the
mother
assenting
rose
and
went
to
the
table
to
fill
their
cups
but
lippo
broke
into
a
loud
wail
pulling
his
mother
back
he
cried
do
go
please
do
we
must
finish
it
we
have
to
finish
it
come
back
mother
come
back
she
tried
to
loosen
the
grip
of
the
boy
firm
little
fingers
on
her
dress
and
to
calm
him
but
she
did
not
succeed
and
he
kept
on
crying
louder
and
louder
come
back
you
said
one
must
not
leave
anything
half
done
we
did
finish
the
song
and
we
must
do
it
kurt
now
began
to
cry
out
too
let
go
your
we
get
to
school
late
mea
voice
joined
them
with
loud
exclamation
against
lippo
who
was
trying
hard
to
pull
his
mother
back
groaning
loudly
all
the
time
uncle
philip
entered
at
this
moment
what
on
earth
is
going
on
here
he
cried
loudly
into
the
confusion
everybody
began
to
explain
lippo
let
go
his
grip
at
last
and
approaching
his
uncle
solicited
his
help
kurt
voice
however
was
the
loudest
and
he
got
the
lead
in
telling
about
lippo
obstinacy
lippo
is
right
the
uncle
decided
one
must
finish
what
one
has
begun
this
is
a
splendid
principle
and
ought
to
be
followed
lippo
has
inherited
this
from
his
and
so
he
shall
also
have
his
help
come
lippo
we
sit
down
and
finish
the
song
to
the
last
word
but
uncle
philip
the
song
has
twelve
stanzas
and
we
have
to
go
to
school
lippo
must
go
too
kurt
cried
out
in
great
agitation
he
ca
get
an
excuse
for
saying
that
he
had
to
finish
his
morning
song
that
is
true
kurt
is
right
said
the
uncle
you
see
lippo
i
know
a
way
out
when
you
sing
mother
must
promise
me
to
finish
the
song
then
you
will
have
sung
it
to
the
end
we
ca
do
that
lippo
wailed
this
is
a
morning
song
and
we
sing
it
at
night
we
must
finish
it
now
wait
kurt
he
cried
aloud
when
he
saw
that
the
boy
was
taking
up
his
what
can
we
do
where
is
your
mother
why
does
she
run
away
at
such
a
moment
uncle
philip
cried
out
helplessly
call
for
your
mother
you
must
go
on
like
that
lippo
had
run
back
to
the
piano
and
leaning
against
it
was
crying
bitterly
kurt
after
opening
the
door
called
loudly
for
his
mother
in
a
voice
that
was
meant
to
bring
her
from
a
distance
this
exertion
proved
unnecessary
as
she
was
standing
immediately
behind
the
door
bruno
in
order
to
question
her
about
something
had
drawn
her
out
with
him
oh
mother
come
in
kurt
cried
in
milder
accents
come
and
teach
our
here
to
get
some
sense
school
is
going
to
start
in
five
minutes
the
mother
entered
maxa
where
did
you
go
the
brother
accosted
her
it
is
high
time
to
get
this
boy
straightened
out
just
look
at
the
way
he
is
clutching
the
piano
in
his
trouble
he
ought
to
be
off
kurt
is
right
the
mother
sitting
down
on
the
took
the
little
boy
hand
and
pulled
him
towards
her
come
lippo
there
is
nothing
to
cry
about
she
said
calmly
listen
while
i
explain
this
it
is
a
splendid
thing
to
finish
anything
one
has
begun
but
there
are
things
that
can
not
be
finished
all
at
once
then
one
divides
these
things
into
separate
parts
and
finishes
part
first
with
the
resolution
to
do
another
part
the
next
day
and
so
on
till
it
is
done
we
shall
say
now
our
song
has
twelve
stanzas
and
we
sing
two
of
them
every
morning
in
that
way
we
can
finish
it
on
the
sixth
day
and
we
have
not
left
it
unfinished
at
all
can
you
understand
lippo
are
you
quiet
now
yes
said
the
little
boy
looking
up
to
his
mother
with
an
expression
of
perfect
satisfaction
the
from
the
uncle
had
to
be
cut
extremely
short
come
soon
again
sounded
three
times
more
from
the
steps
and
then
the
children
started
off
the
mother
looking
through
the
window
followed
them
with
her
eyes
she
was
afraid
that
kurt
and
mea
would
leave
the
little
one
far
behind
on
account
of
having
been
kept
too
long
already
and
it
happened
as
she
feared
she
saw
lippo
trudging
on
behind
with
an
extraordinarily
full
on
his
back
can
you
see
what
lippo
is
carrying
she
asked
her
brother
the
lid
of
the
bag
was
thrust
open
and
a
thick
unwieldy
object
which
did
not
fit
into
it
was
protruding
what
is
he
carrying
along
i
wonder
can
you
see
what
it
is
i
can
only
see
a
round
object
wrapped
up
in
a
gray
paper
her
brother
replied
i
am
sure
it
must
be
something
harmless
i
have
to
say
that
lippo
is
a
wonderfully
obedient
and
good
boy
and
full
of
the
best
sense
as
soon
as
one
says
the
right
word
to
him
he
comes
why
did
you
wait
so
long
though
maxa
before
saying
it
to
him
was
uncle
rather
reproachful
question
why
did
you
run
away
and
leave
him
crying
and
moaning
he
needed
your
help
what
he
wanted
was
perfectly
correct
but
was
not
just
suitable
at
that
moment
and
he
needed
an
explanation
how
could
you
calmly
run
away
it
was
just
as
necessary
to
hear
bruno
question
the
sister
said
i
knew
that
lippo
was
in
good
hands
i
thought
naturally
that
you
would
be
able
to
say
the
right
word
to
him
you
know
yourself
how
he
respects
you
oh
yes
that
is
right
uncle
philip
admitted
it
is
not
always
easy
to
say
the
right
word
to
a
little
fellow
who
has
the
right
on
his
side
and
needs
to
have
the
other
side
shown
to
him
too
he
is
terribly
pedantic
besides
and
says
that
one
ca
sing
a
morning
song
in
the
evening
and
when
he
began
to
wail
in
his
helplessness
it
made
me
miserable
how
should
one
always
just
be
able
to
say
the
right
word
his
sister
smiled
do
you
admit
now
philip
that
bringing
up
children
is
not
a
very
simple
matter
there
is
a
truth
in
what
you
say
on
the
other
hand
it
does
not
look
very
terrible
either
the
brother
said
with
a
glance
at
mäzli
who
was
quietly
and
peacefully
sitting
at
the
table
eating
her
bread
and
milk
in
the
most
orderly
fashion
she
had
been
compelled
to
stop
in
the
middle
of
breakfast
by
the
excitement
caused
by
lippo
it
had
been
very
thrilling
but
now
she
could
calmly
finish
uncle
philip
suddenly
discovered
that
the
tune
set
for
his
departure
was
already
past
taking
a
rapid
leave
of
his
sister
he
started
to
rush
off
but
she
held
him
for
a
moment
please
philip
try
to
find
out
for
me
about
the
little
girl
to
whom
she
belongs
and
with
whom
she
is
travelling
she
begged
him
eagerly
please
do
that
for
me
if
your
supposition
that
she
is
leonore
child
is
right
i
simply
must
see
her
nobody
can
prevent
me
from
seeing
her
once
at
least
we
see
we
see
the
brother
answered
hurriedly
and
was
gone
the
next
moment
the
day
had
started
with
so
much
agitation
and
it
had
all
taken
so
much
time
that
maxa
had
her
hands
full
now
in
order
to
complete
the
most
necessary
tasks
before
the
children
came
back
from
school
mäzli
was
very
obedient
and
had
settled
down
on
her
little
chair
she
was
virtuously
knitting
on
a
white
rag
which
was
to
receive
a
bright
red
border
and
was
destined
to
dust
uncle
philip
desk
it
was
to
be
presented
to
him
on
his
next
birthday
as
a
great
surprise
mäzli
had
in
her
head
this
and
many
other
thoughts
caused
by
the
morning
scene
so
she
did
not
feel
the
same
inclination
to
set
out
on
trips
of
discovery
as
usual
and
remained
quietly
sitting
on
her
chair
her
mother
was
extremely
preoccupied
as
could
easily
be
seen
her
thoughts
had
nothing
to
do
with
either
the
laundry
or
the
orders
she
was
giving
to
kathy
nor
the
cooking
apples
she
had
sorted
out
in
the
cellar
her
hand
often
lay
immovably
on
these
while
she
absently
looked
in
front
of
her
her
thoughts
were
up
in
the
with
the
lovely
young
leonore
and
in
her
imagination
she
was
wandering
about
with
her
beloved
friend
singing
and
chattering
under
the
sounding
pine
trees
her
brother
news
had
wakened
all
these
memories
very
vividly
then
again
she
would
sigh
deeply
and
another
communication
filled
her
full
of
anxiety
bruno
had
asked
her
not
to
wait
for
him
at
dinner
as
he
had
resolved
to
stop
his
comrades
from
a
wicked
design
and
therefore
would
surely
be
a
trifle
late
what
this
was
and
what
action
he
meant
to
prevent
the
boy
had
not
had
time
to
say
for
kurt
had
opened
the
door
at
that
moment
calling
for
her
with
his
voice
of
thunder
all
she
had
been
able
to
do
was
to
beg
bruno
whatever
happened
not
to
let
his
anger
become
his
master
sooner
than
the
mother
had
expected
kurt
steps
could
be
heard
hurriedly
running
into
the
house
followed
by
a
loud
call
for
her
here
i
am
kurt
sounded
calmly
from
the
where
his
mother
had
finally
settled
down
after
her
tasks
beside
mäzli
chair
come
in
first
before
you
try
to
make
your
announcements
or
is
it
so
dreadfully
urgent
kurt
had
already
reached
his
mother
side
oh
mother
when
i
come
home
from
school
i
never
sure
if
you
are
in
the
top
or
the
bottom
of
the
house
he
said
so
i
have
to
inquire
in
plenty
of
time
especially
when
there
is
so
much
to
tell
you
as
there
is
now
listen
first
of
all
the
teacher
thanks
you
for
the
presents
for
the
poor
people
he
lets
you
know
that
if
you
think
it
suitable
to
send
them
a
helmet
of
cardboard
with
a
red
plume
he
will
put
it
by
for
the
present
or
did
you
have
a
special
intention
with
it
i
do
not
understand
a
word
of
what
you
say
kurt
the
mother
replied
that
moment
lippo
opened
the
door
he
was
apt
to
come
home
after
the
older
boy
for
kurt
was
not
obliged
to
wait
for
him
after
school
here
comes
the
one
who
will
be
able
to
explain
the
precious
gift
you
sent
mother
said
kurt
lippo
trotting
cheerfully
into
the
room
had
bright
red
cheeks
from
his
walk
the
mother
began
by
asking
tell
me
lippo
did
you
take
something
to
school
this
morning
in
your
for
the
poor
people
whose
houses
were
burnt
yes
mother
my
helmet
from
uncle
philip
lippo
answered
i
see
you
thought
that
if
a
poor
little
chap
had
no
shirt
he
would
be
glad
to
get
a
fine
helmet
with
a
plume
for
his
head
kurt
said
laughing
you
do
need
to
laugh
lippo
said
a
little
hurt
mother
told
us
that
we
must
not
only
send
things
we
do
want
any
more
so
i
gave
the
helmet
away
and
i
should
have
loved
to
keep
it
do
laugh
at
him
kurt
i
really
told
him
that
the
mother
affirmed
he
wanted
to
do
right
but
he
did
not
quite
find
the
right
way
of
doing
it
if
you
had
told
me
your
intention
lippo
i
could
have
helped
you
to
do
some
positive
good
next
time
you
want
to
help
tell
me
about
it
and
we
do
it
together
yes
i
will
lippo
said
quite
appeased
oh
mother
listen
kurt
was
continuing
i
have
to
tell
you
something
you
wo
like
and
we
do
like
either
just
think
loneli
had
to
sit
on
the
but
all
the
class
is
on
loneli
side
but
why
kurt
the
poor
child
the
mother
exclaimed
what
did
she
do
i
am
afraid
that
her
honest
old
grandmother
will
take
it
terribly
to
heart
she
be
in
deep
sorrow
about
it
and
will
probably
punish
loneli
again
no
indeed
she
must
not
do
that
kurt
said
eagerly
the
teacher
said
himself
that
he
hated
to
put
loneli
there
as
she
was
a
good
and
obedient
child
but
that
he
had
to
keep
his
word
he
had
announced
that
he
was
tired
of
the
constant
chattering
going
on
in
the
school
to
stop
it
he
had
threatened
to
put
the
first
child
on
the
that
was
caught
so
poor
loneli
had
to
sit
there
all
by
herself
and
she
cried
so
terribly
that
we
all
felt
sorry
but
of
course
mother
a
person
does
talk
alone
and
loneli
should
not
have
been
obliged
to
stay
there
alone
the
teacher
had
just
asked
is
talking
over
there
i
can
hear
some
whispering
who
is
it
loneli
answered
in
a
low
voice
so
she
had
to
be
punished
one
of
her
neighbors
should
have
said
too
of
course
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
there
was
another
one
loneli
might
have
asked
somebody
a
question
which
was
not
answered
his
mother
suggested
mea
will
know
all
about
it
for
she
followed
loneli
after
school
now
more
still
mother
kurt
continued
two
boys
from
my
class
were
beaten
this
morning
by
trius
early
this
morning
they
had
climbed
over
the
castle
hedge
to
inspect
the
apples
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
but
trius
was
already
about
and
stood
suddenly
before
them
with
his
heavy
stick
in
a
jiffy
they
had
a
real
for
the
hedge
is
high
and
firm
and
one
ca
get
across
it
quickly
now
for
my
fourth
piece
of
news
farmer
max
who
lives
behind
the
castle
has
told
everybody
that
when
his
father
came
back
late
yesterday
night
from
the
in
the
valley
he
saw
a
large
coach
which
was
right
behind
his
own
drive
into
the
he
was
quite
certain
that
it
went
there
but
nobody
seems
to
know
who
was
in
it
so
you
are
really
listening
at
last
mother
i
noticed
that
you
have
been
absentminded
till
now
farmer
max
told
us
something
else
about
his
father
that
you
would
like
me
to
repeat
i
know
you
would
not
say
so
if
it
were
not
wrong
you
had
better
not
repeat
it
kurt
said
the
mother
no
indeed
it
is
not
bad
but
very
strange
i
can
tell
you
though
because
i
do
believe
it
myself
max
told
that
his
father
said
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
coach
and
that
he
went
far
out
of
its
way
the
coachman
looked
as
if
he
only
had
half
a
head
and
his
was
rolled
up
terribly
high
in
order
to
hide
what
was
below
he
was
wildly
beating
the
horses
so
that
they
fairly
flew
up
the
while
sparks
of
fire
were
flying
from
their
hoofs
how
can
you
tell
such
rubbish
kurt
how
should
there
be
something
unnatural
in
such
a
sight
the
mother
scolded
him
i
am
sure
you
think
that
the
wildenstein
ghost
is
wandering
about
again
you
can
see
every
day
that
horses
hoofs
give
out
sparks
when
they
strike
stone
and
to
see
a
coachman
with
a
rolled
up
collar
in
windy
weather
is
not
an
unusual
sight
either
in
spite
of
all
i
say
to
you
kurt
you
seem
to
do
nothing
but
occupy
yourself
with
this
matter
ca
you
let
the
foolish
people
talk
without
repeating
it
all
the
time
kurt
was
very
glad
when
mea
entered
at
that
moment
for
he
had
really
disobeyed
his
mother
repeated
instructions
in
the
matter
but
he
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
only
acting
according
to
her
ideas
if
he
was
finally
able
to
prove
to
the
people
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
pure
invention
and
could
get
rid
of
the
whole
thing
for
good
why
are
your
eyes
all
swollen
he
accosted
his
sister
mea
exploded
now
half
angry
and
half
complaining
she
still
had
to
fight
against
her
tears
oh
mother
if
you
only
knew
how
difficult
it
is
to
stay
friends
with
elvira
whenever
i
do
anything
to
offend
her
she
sulks
and
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
me
for
days
when
i
want
to
tell
her
something
and
run
towards
her
speaking
a
little
hurriedly
she
is
hurt
then
she
always
says
i
spoil
the
flowers
on
her
hat
because
i
shake
them
and
then
she
turns
her
back
on
me
and
wo
even
speak
to
me
indeed
i
have
seen
that
long
ago
kurt
broke
in
and
i
began
a
song
about
her
yesterday
it
ought
to
be
sung
to
her
i
recite
it
to
you
a
song
about
a
well
known
young
lady
i
know
a
maiden
fair
of
face
who
mostly
turns
her
back
all
noise
she
thinks
a
great
disgrace
but
tricks
she
does
not
lack
no
kurt
you
must
go
on
with
that
song
mea
cried
with
indignation
mea
is
right
when
she
does
want
you
to
celebrate
her
friends
in
that
way
kurt
said
the
mother
and
if
she
asks
you
to
you
must
leave
off
but
i
am
her
brother
and
i
do
not
wish
to
see
my
sister
being
tyranized
over
and
treated
badly
by
a
friend
i
certainly
would
call
her
a
real
friend
kurt
eagerly
exclaimed
i
should
be
only
too
glad
if
my
song
made
her
so
angry
that
she
would
break
the
friendship
entirely
there
would
be
nothing
to
mourn
over
mea
however
fought
passionately
for
her
friend
and
never
gave
way
till
kurt
had
promised
not
to
go
on
with
his
ditty
but
her
mother
wanted
to
know
now
what
had
given
mea
such
red
eyes
so
she
told
them
that
she
had
followed
loneli
in
order
to
comfort
her
for
she
was
still
crying
loneli
had
told
her
then
about
being
caught
at
chattering
elvira
who
was
loneli
neighbor
had
asked
her
if
she
would
be
allowed
to
go
to
sils
on
dedication
day
next
sunday
and
loneli
had
answered
no
then
elvira
wanted
to
know
why
not
to
which
loneli
had
promised
to
give
her
an
answer
after
school
as
they
were
not
allowed
to
talk
in
school
that
moment
the
teacher
had
questioned
them
and
loneli
had
promptly
accused
herself
do
you
think
mother
that
elvira
should
have
admitted
that
she
asked
loneli
a
question
then
loneli
would
not
have
had
to
sit
on
the
alone
he
might
have
given
them
both
a
different
punishment
mea
said
quite
wrought
up
oho
now
she
sent
loneli
to
the
besides
and
loneli
is
a
friend
of
mine
kurt
threw
in
now
she
get
more
verses
after
all
elvira
should
certainly
have
done
so
the
mother
affirmed
yes
and
listen
what
happened
afterwards
mea
continued
with
more
ardor
than
before
i
ran
from
loneli
to
elvira
but
i
was
still
able
to
hear
poor
loneli
sobs
for
she
was
awfully
afraid
to
go
home
she
knew
that
she
had
to
tell
her
grandmother
about
it
and
she
was
sure
that
that
would
bring
her
a
terrible
punishment
when
i
met
elvira
i
told
her
that
it
was
unfair
of
her
not
to
accuse
herself
and
to
let
loneli
bear
the
punishment
alone
that
made
her
fearfully
angry
she
said
that
i
was
a
pleasant
friend
indeed
if
i
wished
this
punishment
and
shame
upon
her
she
should
not
have
said
that
mother
should
she
i
told
her
that
the
matter
was
easy
enough
for
her
as
it
was
all
settled
for
her
but
not
for
loneli
i
asked
to
tell
the
teacher
how
it
all
happened
so
that
he
could
say
something
in
school
and
let
the
children
know
what
answer
loneli
had
given
her
then
he
would
see
that
she
was
innocent
but
elvira
only
grew
angrier
still
and
told
me
that
she
would
look
for
another
friend
if
i
chose
to
preach
to
her
she
said
that
she
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
from
now
on
and
turning
about
ran
away
so
much
the
better
kurt
cried
out
now
you
wo
have
to
run
humbly
after
elvira
any
more
as
if
you
were
always
in
the
wrong
the
way
you
usually
do
to
win
her
precious
favor
why
should
mea
meet
her
friend
kindly
again
if
she
wants
to
kurt
said
the
mother
elvira
knows
well
enough
who
has
been
offended
this
time
and
has
broken
off
the
friendship
she
will
be
only
too
glad
when
mea
meets
her
kurt
was
beginning
another
protest
but
it
was
not
heard
lippo
and
mäzli
arrived
at
that
moment
loudly
announcing
the
important
news
that
kathy
was
going
to
serve
the
soup
in
a
moment
and
that
the
table
was
not
even
set
the
mother
had
put
off
preparations
for
dinner
on
purpose
during
the
foregoing
conversation
she
had
repeatedly
glanced
towards
the
little
garden
gate
to
see
if
bruno
was
not
coming
but
he
could
not
be
seen
yet
so
she
began
to
set
the
table
with
mea
while
lippo
too
assisted
her
the
little
boy
knew
exactly
where
everything
belonged
he
put
it
there
in
the
most
orderly
fashion
and
when
mea
put
a
fork
or
spoon
down
quickly
a
little
crookedly
he
straightway
put
them
perfectly
straight
the
way
they
belonged
kurt
laughed
out
loud
oh
lippo
you
must
become
an
then
all
your
tables
will
look
as
if
they
had
been
measured
out
with
a
compass
leave
lippo
alone
said
the
mother
i
wish
you
would
all
do
your
little
tasks
as
carefully
as
he
does
dinner
was
over
and
the
mother
was
looking
out
towards
the
road
in
greater
anxiety
but
bruno
had
not
come
now
he
comes
with
a
big
whip
kurt
shouted
suddenly
something
must
have
happened
for
one
does
not
usually
need
a
whip
in
school
the
younger
boy
opened
the
door
full
of
expectation
bruno
could
not
help
noticing
his
mother
frightened
expression
despite
the
rage
he
was
in
which
plainly
showed
in
his
face
he
exclaimed
as
he
entered
i
tell
you
right
away
what
happened
mother
so
that
you
wo
think
it
was
still
worse
i
have
only
whipped
them
both
as
they
deserved
that
is
all
but
bruno
that
is
bad
enough
you
seem
to
get
more
savage
all
the
time
the
mother
lamented
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
i
explain
it
right
away
and
then
you
will
have
to
admit
that
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
bruno
assured
her
the
two
told
me
last
saturday
that
they
had
a
scheme
for
in
which
i
was
to
join
they
had
discovered
that
the
lovely
plums
in
the
rector
garden
were
ripe
and
they
meant
to
steal
them
when
the
rector
is
through
with
his
lessons
at
twelve
he
always
goes
to
the
front
room
and
then
nobody
knew
what
is
going
on
in
the
garden
their
plan
was
to
use
this
time
in
order
to
shake
the
tree
and
fill
their
pockets
full
of
plums
i
was
to
help
them
i
told
them
what
a
disgrace
it
was
for
them
to
ask
me
and
i
said
that
i
would
find
means
to
prevent
it
so
they
noisily
called
me
a
traitor
and
told
me
that
accusing
them
was
worse
than
stealing
plums
i
said
that
it
was
my
intention
to
tell
on
them
but
i
would
come
and
use
my
whip
as
soon
as
they
touched
the
tree
so
they
laughed
and
sneered
at
me
and
said
that
they
were
neither
afraid
of
me
nor
of
my
whip
as
soon
as
our
lessons
were
done
at
twelve
they
ran
to
the
garden
and
getting
the
whip
i
had
hidden
in
the
hallway
i
ran
after
them
edwin
was
already
half
way
up
the
tree
and
eugene
was
just
beginning
to
climb
it
first
i
only
threatened
and
tried
in
that
way
to
force
edwin
down
and
keep
eugene
from
going
further
but
they
kept
on
sneering
at
me
till
edwin
had
reached
the
first
branch
and
was
shaking
it
so
hard
that
the
lovely
plums
came
spattering
to
the
ground
i
got
so
furious
at
that
that
i
began
to
beat
first
the
boy
higher
up
and
then
the
lower
one
first
edwin
tumbled
down
on
top
of
eugene
and
then
they
both
ran
away
moaning
while
i
kept
on
striking
them
they
left
the
plums
on
the
ground
and
i
followed
them
it
is
terrible
bruno
that
such
scenes
have
to
come
up
between
you
all
the
time
the
mother
lamented
you
are
always
the
one
who
gets
wild
and
loses
control
it
is
hard
to
excuse
that
even
if
your
intention
is
good
bruno
i
wish
i
could
keep
you
boys
apart
it
was
a
good
thing
he
became
furious
at
them
mother
kurt
remarked
you
see
it
shows
that
even
two
ca
get
the
better
of
him
if
he
had
not
been
so
mad
the
two
would
have
been
stronger
and
our
poor
rector
would
have
lost
his
plums
it
was
hard
to
tell
if
this
explanation
comforted
the
mother
she
had
gone
out
with
a
sign
to
attend
to
bruno
belated
lunch
the
time
was
already
near
at
hand
when
all
the
children
had
to
get
back
to
school
when
that
same
evening
the
little
ones
were
happily
playing
and
the
big
children
were
busy
with
their
school
work
kurt
stole
up
to
his
chair
and
asked
her
in
a
low
voice
shall
we
have
the
story
the
mother
nodded
as
soon
as
the
little
ones
are
in
bed
at
this
mäzli
pricked
up
her
ears
when
all
the
work
was
done
in
the
evening
all
the
family
usually
played
a
game
together
kurt
who
was
usually
the
first
to
pack
up
his
papers
was
still
scribbling
away
after
mea
had
laid
hers
away
looking
over
his
shoulder
into
the
she
exclaimed
he
is
writing
some
verses
again
who
is
the
subject
of
your
song
kurt
i
read
it
to
you
then
you
can
guess
yourself
said
the
boy
the
first
verse
is
already
written
somewhere
else
now
listen
to
the
second
she
stares
about
with
stately
mien
o
ho
just
look
at
me
if
i
am
not
acknowledged
queen
i
surely
ought
to
be
her
friend
agrees
with
patient
air
and
fastens
up
her
shoes
then
queenie
thinks
that
only
fair
she
could
well
refuse
but
if
the
friend
should
try
to
show
the
queen
her
faults
look
out
she
break
the
friendship
at
a
blow
and
straightway
turn
about
mea
had
been
obliged
to
laugh
a
little
at
first
at
the
description
of
the
humble
behaviour
which
did
not
seem
to
describe
her
very
well
finally
however
sad
memories
rose
up
in
her
do
you
know
mother
she
cried
out
excitedly
it
is
not
the
worst
that
she
shows
me
her
back
but
that
one
ca
ever
agree
with
her
every
time
i
find
anything
pleasant
and
good
she
says
the
opposite
and
when
i
say
that
something
is
wrong
and
horrid
she
wo
be
of
my
opinion
either
it
is
so
hard
to
keep
her
friendship
because
we
always
seem
to
quarrel
when
i
have
the
slightest
desire
to
just
let
her
go
she
is
the
same
as
her
brothers
said
bruno
i
never
want
their
friendship
again
and
i
wish
i
might
never
have
anything
more
to
do
with
them
it
is
better
to
give
them
things
the
way
you
did
kurt
remarked
i
can
understand
mea
said
the
mother
as
soon
as
we
came
here
she
tried
to
get
elvira
friendship
she
longs
for
friendship
more
than
you
do
oh
mother
i
have
six
or
eight
friends
here
that
is
not
so
bad
kurt
declared
i
could
say
much
for
any
of
them
bruno
said
quickly
it
must
hurt
mea
the
mother
continued
that
elvira
does
not
seem
to
be
capable
of
friendship
you
only
act
right
in
telling
her
what
you
consider
wrong
mea
if
you
show
your
attachment
to
her
and
try
not
to
be
hurt
by
little
differences
of
opinion
your
friendship
might
gradually
improve
as
lippo
and
mäzli
felt
that
the
time
for
the
general
game
had
come
they
came
up
to
their
mother
to
declare
their
wish
soon
everybody
was
merrily
playing
it
happened
as
it
did
every
day
that
the
clock
pointed
much
too
soon
to
the
time
which
meant
the
inexorable
end
of
playing
this
usually
happened
when
everybody
was
most
eager
and
everything
else
was
forgotten
for
the
moment
as
soon
as
the
clock
struck
playing
was
discontinued
the
evening
song
was
sung
and
then
followed
the
disappearance
of
the
two
little
ones
while
the
older
children
put
away
the
toys
the
mother
went
to
the
piano
to
choose
the
song
they
were
to
sing
mäzli
had
quickly
run
after
her
oh
please
mama
can
i
choose
the
song
she
asked
eagerly
certainly
tell
me
which
song
you
would
like
to
sing
best
mäzli
seized
the
effectively
but
mäzli
you
ca
even
read
said
the
mother
how
would
the
book
help
you
tell
me
how
the
song
begins
or
what
lines
you
know
i
find
it
right
away
mäzli
asserted
just
let
me
hunt
a
little
bit
with
this
she
began
to
hunt
with
such
zeal
as
if
she
were
seeking
a
treasure
here
here
she
cried
out
very
soon
while
she
handed
the
book
proudly
over
to
her
mother
the
latter
took
the
book
and
read
patience
oh
lord
is
needed
when
sorrow
grief
and
pain
but
mäzli
why
do
you
want
to
sing
this
song
her
mother
asked
kurt
had
stepped
up
to
them
and
looked
over
the
mother
shoulder
into
the
book
oh
you
sly
little
person
so
you
chose
the
longest
song
you
could
find
you
thought
that
lippo
would
see
to
it
that
we
would
sing
every
syllable
before
going
to
bed
yes
and
you
hate
to
go
to
bed
much
more
than
i
do
said
mäzli
a
little
revengefully
it
had
filled
her
with
wrath
that
her
beautiful
plan
had
been
seen
through
so
quickly
when
you
have
to
go
you
always
sigh
as
loud
as
yesterday
and
cry
what
a
shame
oh
what
a
shame
and
you
think
it
is
fearful
quite
right
cunning
little
mäzli
kurt
laughed
come
come
children
now
we
sing
instead
of
quarrelling
the
mother
admonished
them
we
sing
lovely
moon
is
risen
you
know
all
the
words
of
that
from
beginning
to
end
mäzli
they
all
started
and
finished
the
whole
song
in
peace
when
the
mother
came
back
later
on
from
the
beds
of
the
two
younger
children
the
three
elder
ones
sat
expectantly
around
the
table
for
kurt
had
told
them
of
their
mother
promise
to
tell
them
the
story
of
the
family
of
wallerstätten
that
evening
they
had
already
placed
their
mother
on
the
table
in
preparation
of
what
was
to
come
because
they
knew
that
she
would
not
tell
them
a
story
without
knitting
at
the
same
time
smilingly
the
mother
approached
everything
is
ready
i
see
so
i
can
begin
right
away
yes
and
right
from
the
start
please
from
the
place
where
the
ghost
first
comes
in
the
mother
looked
questioningly
at
kurt
it
seems
to
me
kurt
that
you
still
hope
to
find
out
about
this
ghost
whatever
i
may
say
to
the
contrary
i
shall
tell
you
though
how
people
first
began
to
talk
about
a
ghost
in
wildenstein
the
origin
of
these
rumors
goes
back
many
many
years
there
is
a
picture
in
the
castle
the
mother
began
to
relate
which
i
often
looked
at
as
a
child
and
which
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
it
represents
a
pilgrim
who
wanders
restlessly
about
far
countries
despite
his
hair
which
is
blowing
about
his
head
and
despite
his
looking
old
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
picture
of
the
ancestor
of
the
family
of
wallerstätten
the
family
name
is
thought
to
have
been
different
at
that
time
this
ancestor
is
said
to
have
been
a
man
extremely
susceptible
to
violent
outbreaks
in
his
passion
he
was
supposed
to
have
committed
many
evil
deeds
on
account
of
which
his
poor
wife
could
not
console
herself
praying
for
him
she
lay
whole
days
on
her
knees
in
the
chapel
she
died
suddenly
however
and
this
shocked
the
baron
so
mightily
that
he
could
not
remain
in
the
castle
in
order
to
find
peace
for
his
restless
soul
he
became
a
repentant
pilgrim
so
he
took
the
emblem
of
a
pilgrim
into
his
coat
of
arms
and
called
himself
wallerstätten
leaving
his
estate
and
his
sons
he
nevermore
returned
later
on
two
of
his
descendants
lived
in
the
castle
both
were
well
loved
and
respected
because
they
did
a
great
deal
to
have
the
land
cultivated
for
a
long
distance
around
and
as
a
result
all
the
farmers
became
rich
but
both
had
inherited
the
violent
temper
of
their
ancestor
and
the
truth
is
that
there
always
were
members
in
the
family
with
that
fatal
characteristic
nobody
knew
what
happened
between
the
brothers
but
one
morning
one
of
them
was
found
dead
on
the
floor
of
the
big
all
that
the
castle
guard
knew
about
it
was
that
his
two
masters
had
settled
a
dispute
with
a
duel
the
other
brother
had
immediately
disappeared
but
was
brought
back
dead
to
the
castle
a
few
days
afterwards
climbing
up
a
high
mountain
he
had
fallen
down
a
precipice
and
had
been
found
dead
these
events
threw
all
the
neighborhood
into
great
consternation
that
is
when
the
rumors
first
spread
that
the
restless
spirit
of
the
brother
murderer
was
seen
wandering
about
the
castle
all
this
happened
many
years
before
my
father
and
your
grandfather
moved
into
nolla
as
rector
the
rumor
had
somewhat
faded
then
and
all
that
we
children
heard
about
it
was
that
my
father
was
very
positive
in
denying
all
such
reports
that
reached
his
ears
your
grandfather
was
the
closest
friend
of
the
master
of
wallerstätten
whom
everybody
called
the
baron
i
can
only
remember
seeing
him
once
for
a
moment
but
he
made
an
unusual
impression
upon
me
i
remember
him
very
vividly
as
a
very
tall
man
going
with
rapid
steps
through
the
courtyard
and
mounting
a
horse
which
was
trying
to
rear
he
died
before
i
was
five
years
old
and
i
have
often
heard
my
father
say
to
my
mother
that
it
was
a
great
misfortune
for
the
two
sons
to
have
lost
their
father
i
felt
so
sorry
for
them
that
i
would
often
stop
in
the
middle
of
play
to
ask
her
mother
can
nobody
help
them
to
comfort
me
she
would
tell
me
that
god
alone
could
help
for
a
long
time
i
prayed
every
night
before
going
to
sleep
god
please
help
them
in
their
trouble
both
were
always
very
kind
and
friendly
with
me
i
was
up
at
the
castle
a
great
deal
because
the
baroness
maximiliana
of
wallerstätten
was
my
godmother
my
father
instructed
the
two
sons
and
acted
as
helper
and
adviser
to
the
baroness
in
many
things
he
went
up
to
her
every
morning
holding
me
by
one
hand
and
philip
by
the
other
my
brother
had
lessons
together
with
the
boys
who
were
one
year
apart
in
age
while
philip
was
just
between
them
bruno
the
elder
i
was
named
after
him
mother
was
i
bruno
interrupted
here
salo
was
a
year
younger
i
was
called
after
him
mea
said
quickly
you
wanted
a
salo
so
much
and
as
i
was
a
girl
you
called
me
malomea
did
you
the
mother
nodded
and
i
was
called
after
father
kurt
cried
out
in
order
to
prove
that
his
name
also
had
a
worthy
origin
i
went
up
to
the
castle
because
my
godmother
wished
it
she
would
have
loved
to
have
a
little
daughter
herself
therefore
she
occupied
herself
with
me
as
if
i
belonged
to
her
she
taught
me
to
embroider
and
to
do
other
fine
handwork
whenever
she
went
with
me
into
the
garden
and
through
the
estate
she
taught
me
all
about
the
trees
and
flowers
i
was
often
allowed
to
pick
the
violets
that
grew
in
great
abundance
beneath
the
hedges
and
in
the
grass
at
the
border
of
the
little
woods
oh
what
beautiful
days
those
were
soon
they
were
to
become
more
perfect
still
for
us
but
i
received
an
impression
in
those
days
which
remained
in
my
heart
for
a
long
while
like
a
menacing
power
often
frightening
me
so
that
i
was
very
unhappy
once
my
father
came
down
very
silently
from
the
castle
when
my
mother
asked
him
if
anything
had
happened
he
replied
and
i
still
hear
his
words
bruno
has
inherited
his
dreadful
passion
his
mother
is
naturally
more
worried
about
this
than
about
anything
else
look
at
him
kurt
said
dryly
glancing
at
bruno
who
was
sitting
beside
his
mother
for
answer
bruno
eyes
flashed
threateningly
at
his
brother
oh
please
go
on
mother
mea
urged
she
was
in
no
mood
to
have
the
tale
interrupted
by
a
fight
between
her
brothers
it
seemed
terrible
to
me
the
mother
continued
again
that
bruno
my
generous
kind
friend
should
have
anything
in
his
character
to
worry
his
mother
often
i
cried
quietly
in
a
corner
about
it
and
wondered
how
such
a
thing
could
be
i
had
to
admit
it
myself
however
whenever
the
three
boys
had
a
disagreement
or
anybody
did
something
to
displease
bruno
he
would
get
quite
beside
himself
with
rage
acting
in
a
way
which
he
must
have
been
sorry
for
later
on
i
have
to
repeat
again
though
that
he
had
at
bottom
a
noble
and
generous
nature
and
would
never
have
willingly
harmed
anyone
or
committed
a
cruel
deed
but
one
could
see
that
his
outbreaks
of
passion
might
drive
him
to
desperate
deeds
salo
his
brother
never
became
angry
but
he
had
a
very
unyielding
nature
just
the
same
he
was
just
as
obstinate
in
his
way
as
his
brother
and
never
gave
in
philip
was
always
on
his
side
for
the
two
were
the
best
of
friends
bruno
was
much
more
reserved
and
taciturn
than
salo
who
was
naturally
very
gay
and
could
sing
and
laugh
so
that
the
halls
would
loudly
with
his
merriment
the
baroness
herself
often
laughed
in
that
way
too
that
is
why
bruno
imagined
that
she
loved
her
younger
son
better
than
him
and
because
he
himself
loved
his
mother
passionately
he
could
not
endure
this
thought
it
was
not
true
however
she
loved
his
eldest
boy
passionately
and
everybody
who
was
close
to
her
could
see
it
when
i
was
ten
years
old
and
philip
fifteen
an
unusually
charming
girl
was
added
to
our
little
circle
i
above
everybody
else
was
enchanted
with
her
our
friends
at
the
castle
and
even
philip
who
certainly
was
not
easily
filled
with
enthusiasm
were
extremely
enthusiastic
about
our
new
playmate
she
was
a
girl
of
eleven
years
old
you
see
just
a
year
older
than
i
was
she
was
far
far
above
me
though
in
knowledge
ability
and
especially
in
her
manners
and
whole
behaviour
so
that
i
was
perfectly
carried
away
by
her
charm
her
name
was
leonore
she
was
related
to
the
baroness
and
had
come
down
from
the
far
north
in
fact
from
holstein
where
my
godmother
came
from
and
all
her
connections
lived
leonore
the
daughter
of
one
of
her
relations
had
very
early
lost
her
father
and
mother
as
her
mother
had
died
soon
after
the
baroness
decided
to
adopt
the
child
she
knew
that
leonore
would
otherwise
be
all
alone
in
the
world
and
she
hoped
that
a
gentle
sister
would
have
an
extremely
beneficial
influence
on
the
two
brothers
now
a
time
began
for
me
which
was
more
wonderful
than
anything
i
could
ever
have
imagined
leonore
was
to
continue
her
studies
of
course
and
take
up
new
ones
for
that
purpose
a
very
refined
german
lady
came
to
the
castle
very
soon
after
leonore
arrival
only
years
afterwards
i
realized
what
a
splendid
teacher
she
had
been
my
godmother
had
arranged
for
me
to
share
the
studies
with
leonore
and
therefore
i
was
to
live
all
day
at
the
castle
as
her
companion
only
returning
in
the
evenings
so
we
two
girls
spent
all
our
time
together
and
in
bad
weather
i
also
remained
there
for
the
night
leonore
had
a
tremendous
influence
on
me
and
i
am
glad
to
say
an
influence
for
my
good
for
i
was
able
to
look
up
to
her
in
everything
whatever
was
common
or
low
was
absolutely
foreign
to
her
noble
nature
this
close
companionship
with
her
was
not
only
the
greatest
enjoyment
of
my
young
years
but
was
the
greatest
of
benefits
for
my
whole
life
you
certainly
were
lucky
mother
mea
exclaimed
passionately
yes
and
uncle
philip
was
lucky
too
to
have
two
such
nice
friends
bruno
added
i
realize
that
the
mother
answered
you
have
no
idea
children
how
often
i
have
wished
that
you
too
could
have
such
friends
please
go
on
kurt
begged
impatiently
where
did
they
go
mother
does
anyone
know
what
has
become
of
them
whenever
our
brothers
as
we
called
them
were
free
the
mother
continued
they
were
our
beloved
playmates
we
valued
their
stimulating
company
very
much
and
were
always
happy
when
through
some
chance
they
were
exempt
from
some
of
their
numerous
lessons
they
always
asked
us
to
join
them
in
their
games
and
we
were
very
happy
that
they
wanted
our
company
baroness
von
wallerstätten
had
guessed
right
since
leonore
had
come
into
our
midst
the
brothers
fought
much
more
seldom
and
everybody
who
knew
bruno
well
could
see
that
he
tried
to
suppress
his
outbursts
of
rage
in
her
presence
once
leonore
had
become
pale
with
fright
when
she
had
been
obliged
to
witness
such
a
scene
and
bruno
had
not
forgotten
it
four
years
had
passed
for
us
in
cloudless
sunshine
when
a
great
change
took
place
the
young
barons
left
the
castle
in
order
to
attend
a
university
in
germany
and
philip
also
left
for
an
agricultural
school
so
we
only
saw
the
brothers
once
a
year
during
their
brief
holidays
in
the
summer
those
days
were
great
feast
days
then
for
all
of
us
and
we
enjoyed
every
single
hour
of
their
stay
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
we
always
began
and
ended
every
day
with
music
and
frequently
whole
days
were
spent
in
the
enjoyment
of
it
both
young
wallerstättens
were
extremely
musical
and
had
splendid
voices
and
leonore
exquisite
singing
stirred
everybody
deeply
the
baroness
always
said
that
leonore
voice
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
no
matter
if
she
sang
merry
or
serious
songs
it
affected
me
in
that
way
too
and
one
could
never
grow
weary
of
hearing
her
i
had
just
finished
my
seventeenth
and
leonore
her
eighteenth
year
when
a
summer
came
which
was
to
bring
grave
changes
we
did
not
expect
philip
home
for
the
holidays
through
the
baroness
help
he
was
already
filling
the
post
of
manager
of
an
estate
in
the
far
north
the
young
barons
had
also
completed
their
studies
and
were
expected
to
come
home
and
to
consult
with
their
mother
about
their
plans
for
the
future
she
fully
expected
them
to
travel
before
settling
down
and
after
that
she
hoped
sincerely
that
one
of
them
would
come
to
live
at
home
with
her
this
would
mean
that
he
would
take
the
care
of
the
estate
on
his
shoulders
with
its
troubles
and
responsibilities
soon
after
their
arrival
the
sons
seemed
to
have
had
an
interview
with
their
mother
which
clearly
worried
her
for
she
went
about
silently
refusing
to
answer
any
questions
bruno
strode
up
and
down
the
terrace
with
flaming
eyes
whole
hours
at
a
time
without
saying
a
word
salo
was
the
only
sociable
one
left
and
sometimes
he
would
come
and
sit
down
beside
us
but
if
we
questioned
him
about
their
apparent
feud
he
remained
silent
how
different
this
was
from
our
former
gay
days
but
this
painful
situation
did
not
last
long
on
the
fifth
or
sixth
day
after
their
arrival
the
brothers
did
not
appear
for
breakfast
the
baroness
immediately
inquired
in
great
anxiety
if
they
had
left
the
castle
but
nobody
seemed
to
have
noticed
them
apollonie
was
the
only
one
who
had
seen
them
going
upstairs
together
in
the
early
morning
so
she
was
sent
up
to
look
for
them
in
the
tower
rooms
when
she
found
them
empty
she
opened
the
door
of
the
old
by
some
strange
impulse
here
salo
was
crouching
half
fainting
on
the
floor
he
told
her
that
it
was
nothing
to
worry
about
and
that
he
had
only
lost
consciousness
for
a
moment
she
had
to
help
him
to
get
up
however
and
he
came
downstairs
supported
on
her
arm
the
baroness
never
said
a
word
she
stayed
in
her
son
chamber
till
the
physician
who
had
been
sent
for
had
gone
away
again
then
returning
to
us
she
sat
down
beside
leonore
and
me
and
told
us
that
we
ought
to
know
what
had
happened
apparently
she
was
very
calm
but
i
had
never
seen
her
face
so
pale
she
informed
us
that
when
she
had
spoken
to
her
sons
about
their
future
plans
she
had
discovered
that
neither
of
them
had
ever
spoken
about
it
to
the
other
now
they
both
declared
to
her
that
their
full
intention
had
been
for
years
to
come
home
after
the
completion
of
their
studies
and
to
live
in
wildenstein
with
her
and
leonore
bruno
was
quite
beside
himself
when
he
found
that
salo
had
apparently
no
intention
to
yield
to
him
in
the
matter
so
he
challenged
his
brother
to
a
duel
in
order
to
decide
which
of
them
was
to
remain
at
home
salo
had
been
wounded
and
losing
consciousness
had
fallen
to
the
ground
bruno
fearing
something
worse
had
disappeared
the
doctor
had
not
found
sale
wounds
of
a
serious
nature
but
as
he
had
a
delicate
constitution
great
care
had
to
be
taken
when
i
left
the
castle
that
day
i
felt
that
all
the
joy
and
happiness
i
had
ever
known
on
earth
was
shattered
and
this
feeling
stayed
with
me
a
long
while
after
soon
after
that
sad
event
the
baroness
got
ready
for
a
journey
to
the
south
where
she
meant
to
go
with
salo
and
leonore
salo
had
not
recovered
as
quickly
as
she
had
hoped
and
leonore
instead
of
getting
more
robust
in
our
vigorous
only
became
thinner
and
frailer
only
once
bruno
sent
his
mother
some
news
in
extremely
few
words
he
let
her
know
that
he
was
going
to
spain
and
that
she
need
not
trouble
more
about
him
but
the
news
of
his
brother
survival
reached
him
nevertheless
now
all
those
i
had
loved
so
passionately
had
gone
away
and
i
felt
it
very
deeply
there
the
castle
stood
sad
and
lifeless
and
its
lighted
windows
looked
down
no
more
upon
us
from
the
height
all
its
eyes
were
closed
and
were
to
remain
so
oh
oh
did
they
never
come
back
cried
out
kurt
with
regret
no
never
the
mother
replied
at
that
time
too
apparently
all
the
reports
which
had
long
ago
faded
were
revived
as
to
a
ghost
who
was
supposed
to
wander
about
the
castle
there
were
many
who
asserted
they
had
seen
or
heard
him
and
till
the
ghost
of
wildenstein
is
haunting
people
heads
look
at
him
said
bruno
dryly
pointing
to
the
lower
end
of
the
table
where
kurt
was
sitting
finish
please
mother
the
latter
quickly
urged
where
did
they
all
get
to
and
where
is
the
brother
who
disappeared
all
i
still
have
to
tell
you
is
short
and
sad
said
the
mother
leonore
faithfully
wrote
to
me
after
spending
the
first
winter
in
the
south
it
became
apparent
that
the
baroness
health
was
shattered
she
refused
to
return
to
the
castle
and
sent
her
instructions
to
apollonie
who
had
married
the
gardener
of
wildenstein
and
who
now
with
her
husband
became
caretaker
of
the
castle
three
years
afterwards
the
baroness
died
without
ever
having
returned
a
short
time
after
that
leonore
became
salo
wife
but
they
were
not
fated
to
remain
together
long
not
more
than
three
years
later
salo
died
of
a
violent
fever
and
leonore
followed
him
in
a
few
months
but
they
left
a
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
after
salo
death
leonore
was
left
alone
in
life
so
an
aunt
from
holstein
came
to
live
with
her
in
nice
after
leonore
death
this
aunt
took
the
two
children
home
with
her
i
heard
this
from
apollonie
who
had
been
sent
leonore
last
instructions
by
this
aunt
i
never
learned
anything
further
about
the
two
children
and
only
once
did
i
receive
word
from
baron
bruno
through
apollonie
your
late
father
young
rector
bergmann
had
married
me
just
about
the
time
when
we
heard
of
the
baroness
death
i
followed
him
very
gladly
to
sils
because
philip
had
just
bought
an
estate
there
and
was
very
anxious
to
have
me
close
to
him
one
day
apollonie
came
to
me
in
great
agitation
baron
bruno
never
once
sending
word
had
arrived
in
the
castle
after
an
absence
of
eight
years
and
had
brought
with
him
a
companion
by
the
name
of
demetrius
the
baron
had
naturally
expected
to
find
his
mother
his
brother
and
his
erstwhile
playmates
gathered
there
as
before
when
he
heard
from
apollonie
everything
that
had
happened
in
his
absence
he
broke
into
a
violent
passion
because
he
believed
that
the
news
had
been
purposely
kept
from
him
apollonie
was
able
to
show
him
his
late
mother
letters
where
she
had
given
her
exact
orders
in
case
of
his
return
he
could
also
see
from
them
that
she
wrote
to
him
frequently
and
had
tried
to
reach
him
in
vain
baron
bruno
had
lived
an
extremely
unsettled
existence
and
all
the
letters
had
miscarried
despite
the
orders
he
had
left
in
big
cities
to
have
them
forwarded
full
of
anger
and
bitterness
the
baron
immediately
left
and
till
the
present
hour
he
has
not
been
heard
of
demetrius
later
on
called
trius
by
everybody
came
back
a
few
years
ago
to
the
deserted
castle
apollonie
had
meanwhile
lost
her
husband
had
closed
up
all
the
rooms
at
the
castle
and
had
gone
to
live
again
in
the
former
gardener
cottage
where
she
is
living
now
from
the
time
when
he
reappeared
till
trius
has
led
a
solitary
life
and
sees
no
one
except
apollonie
and
her
only
when
he
is
in
need
of
her
however
hard
apollonie
tried
to
make
him
tell
about
his
master
he
would
not
do
it
you
know
now
about
my
happy
life
in
wildenstein
and
will
be
able
to
understand
the
reason
why
i
moved
here
again
after
the
death
of
your
father
another
inducement
was
that
our
dear
rector
an
erstwhile
friend
of
my
father
promised
to
give
bruno
instruction
which
he
could
not
get
at
a
country
school
so
that
i
was
able
to
keep
him
at
home
longer
you
see
now
you
know
why
the
deserted
castle
attracts
me
so
despite
its
sad
aspect
for
it
brings
back
to
me
my
most
beautiful
memories
oh
please
mother
tell
us
a
little
more
kurt
begged
eagerly
when
his
mother
rose
oh
mother
mea
joined
in
tell
us
more
about
your
friend
leonore
oh
yes
tell
us
more
mother
bruno
supplicated
there
must
be
more
to
know
still
did
baron
bruno
keep
on
travelling
in
spain
i
think
most
of
the
time
but
i
ca
tell
you
for
sure
the
mother
replied
i
know
everything
only
from
apollonie
who
had
these
reports
from
trius
but
he
either
does
not
choose
to
talk
or
does
not
know
very
much
himself
about
his
master
i
have
told
you
everything
now
and
you
must
go
to
bed
as
quickly
as
you
can
it
was
your
bedtime
long
ago
no
questions
or
supplications
helped
now
and
soon
the
house
was
silent
except
for
the
mother
quiet
steps
as
she
once
more
visited
the
children
beds
her
eldest
who
could
become
so
violent
lay
before
her
with
a
peaceful
expression
on
his
clear
brow
she
knew
how
high
his
standard
of
honor
was
but
how
would
he
end
if
his
unfortunate
trait
gained
more
ascendancy
over
him
soon
she
would
be
obliged
to
send
him
away
and
how
could
she
hope
for
a
loving
influence
in
strange
surroundings
which
was
the
only
thing
to
quiet
him
the
mother
knew
that
she
had
not
the
power
to
keep
her
children
from
pain
and
sin
but
she
knew
the
hand
which
leads
and
steadies
all
children
that
are
entrusted
to
it
that
can
guard
and
save
where
no
mother
hand
or
love
can
avail
she
went
with
folded
hands
from
one
bed
to
the
other
surrendering
her
children
to
their
father
protection
in
heaven
he
knew
best
how
much
they
were
in
need
of
his
loving
care
chapter
iv
an
unexpected
apparition
kurt
had
so
many
plans
the
next
day
that
he
already
rushed
to
school
as
if
he
had
not
a
minute
to
lose
mea
and
lippo
who
started
with
him
looked
full
of
astonishment
at
his
unusual
speed
arriving
at
the
school
he
saw
loneli
coming
along
with
a
drooping
head
and
not
as
usual
with
a
happy
stride
what
is
it
loneli
asked
kurt
coming
nearer
why
are
your
eyes
swollen
already
before
it
is
even
eight
just
he
happy
help
you
did
anybody
hurt
you
no
kurt
no
one
but
i
ca
be
happy
any
more
and
with
these
words
loneli
eyes
filled
again
with
tears
i
wish
you
could
see
grandmother
since
i
been
on
the
i
would
not
mind
if
she
were
angry
for
she
generally
forgives
me
again
after
a
while
but
she
is
sad
all
the
time
it
is
worst
when
i
go
to
school
in
the
morning
because
she
says
that
i
brought
down
shame
on
us
both
and
that
i
have
given
her
gray
hairs
she
said
to
me
that
after
having
lived
an
honorable
life
and
spent
most
of
it
with
the
most
noble
family
this
was
very
hard
for
her
she
felt
as
if
she
had
raised
me
only
to
bring
down
shame
on
both
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
loneli
broke
out
anew
into
tears
this
neverending
disgrace
together
with
the
constant
reproaches
she
had
had
to
bear
seemed
to
choke
her
no
no
loneli
you
do
need
to
cry
any
more
it
is
not
at
all
the
way
your
grandmother
is
taking
it
kurt
said
consolingly
i
go
to
her
ever
so
soon
to
explain
what
happened
please
be
happy
and
everything
will
come
out
all
right
do
you
think
so
loneli
asked
pleasantly
surprised
her
eyes
were
clear
again
for
she
always
believed
whatever
kurt
said
to
her
now
he
rushed
over
to
the
noisy
crowd
of
children
who
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
for
him
kurt
was
always
glad
to
have
such
numerous
friends
for
he
usually
needed
a
large
following
for
the
execution
of
his
schemes
he
had
two
large
undertakings
in
his
head
and
he
needed
to
persuade
his
comrades
to
join
him
he
was
explaining
with
such
violent
gestures
and
eager
words
that
they
entirely
neglected
the
first
strokes
of
the
tower
bell
at
the
last
and
eighth
stroke
the
little
crowd
dispersed
as
suddenly
as
a
flock
of
frightened
birds
then
they
rushed
into
the
school
house
kurt
was
home
ahead
of
everybody
too
he
approached
his
mother
with
a
large
sheet
of
paper
look
mother
trius
got
a
song
yesterday
evening
he
threatened
two
more
of
my
friends
with
the
stick
but
they
were
luckily
able
to
save
themselves
it
seems
as
if
he
had
at
least
four
eyes
and
ears
which
can
see
and
hear
whatever
is
going
on
i
finished
the
song
can
i
read
it
to
you
i
wish
you
had
no
friends
that
trius
has
occasion
to
frighten
with
a
stick
said
the
mother
i
hope
that
it
wo
ever
happen
to
you
oh
he
often
threatens
innocent
people
kurt
replied
listen
to
a
true
description
of
him
a
song
about
trius
the
boy
beater
old
trius
lives
in
our
town
a
haughty
man
is
he
and
every
one
that
he
can
catch
he
beats
right
heartily
old
trius
wears
a
yellow
coat
it
very
long
and
thick
but
all
the
children
run
away
at
sight
of
his
big
stick
old
trius
of
the
pointed
hat
he
wanders
all
around
and
if
he
beats
nobody
why
there
no
one
to
be
found
old
trius
thinks
to
spank
a
boy
is
really
very
kind
and
all
he
can
not
hit
in
front
at
least
he
hits
behind
old
trius
makes
a
pretty
face
with
every
blow
he
gives
he
beat
us
all
for
many
years
i
thinking
if
he
lives
the
mother
could
not
help
smiling
a
little
bit
during
the
perusal
but
now
she
said
seriously
this
song
must
under
no
condition
fall
into
trius
hands
he
might
not
look
at
it
as
a
joke
and
you
must
not
offend
him
i
advise
you
kurt
not
to
challenge
trius
in
any
way
for
he
might
reply
to
you
in
some
unexpected
fashion
he
has
his
own
ways
and
means
of
getting
rid
of
people
kurt
was
very
anxious
to
get
his
mother
permission
to
run
about
that
same
evening
by
moonlight
with
his
friends
and
his
mother
granted
it
willingly
i
hope
you
are
not
going
on
one
of
the
unfortunate
i
hear
so
much
about
she
added
kurt
quite
indignantly
assured
her
that
he
would
never
do
such
a
thing
lippo
was
pushing
him
to
one
side
now
the
little
boy
had
made
attempts
to
reach
his
mother
for
several
minutes
and
he
was
delighted
at
his
brother
quick
departure
rector
sends
you
his
regards
and
he
wants
to
know
if
you
wanted
to
give
him
an
answer
here
is
a
letter
said
lippo
where
did
you
bring
the
letter
from
asked
the
mother
i
did
bring
the
letter
lise
from
the
rectory
brought
it
was
lippo
information
but
lise
saw
me
in
front
of
the
door
and
said
that
i
should
take
the
letter
up
with
me
and
give
it
to
you
and
tell
her
whether
you
wanted
to
give
the
rector
an
answer
or
not
oh
that
is
just
the
way
a
message
ought
to
be
given
the
mother
said
with
a
smile
did
you
hear
it
mäzli
i
wish
you
could
learn
from
lippo
how
to
do
it
whenever
you
have
one
to
give
i
have
such
trouble
to
find
out
what
really
happened
and
what
you
have
only
imagined
mäzli
whose
was
at
that
moment
in
the
most
hopelessly
knotted
condition
was
ever
so
glad
when
her
mother
suggested
a
new
activity
quickly
flinging
her
knitting
away
she
jumped
up
from
her
stool
then
she
began
to
repeat
lippo
speech
word
for
word
i
did
not
bring
the
letter
lise
from
the
rectory
no
no
mäzli
i
do
not
mean
it
that
way
the
mother
interrupted
her
i
mean
that
the
reports
you
bring
me
so
often
sound
quite
impossible
i
want
you
to
be
as
careful
and
exact
in
them
as
lippo
in
the
meantime
the
mother
had
opened
the
letter
and
looked
suddenly
quite
frightened
tell
the
girl
that
i
shall
go
to
rector
myself
and
that
she
need
not
wait
for
an
answer
was
her
message
entrusted
to
lippo
the
thing
she
had
dreaded
so
much
was
settled
now
the
rector
let
her
know
in
his
letter
that
he
had
realized
the
time
had
come
for
his
pupils
to
be
put
into
different
hands
he
wrote
that
he
had
decided
to
discontinue
the
studies
with
them
next
fall
but
that
he
would
be
only
too
glad
to
be
of
assistance
to
maxa
in
consulting
about
further
education
he
closed
with
an
assurance
that
he
would
be
the
happier
to
do
so
because
bruno
had
always
been
very
dear
to
him
maxa
sitting
silently
with
folded
hands
was
lost
in
thought
this
was
something
that
happened
very
seldom
but
mea
stood
before
her
and
trying
to
get
her
sympathy
with
passionate
gestures
just
think
mother
she
cried
out
elvira
is
so
angry
now
that
she
will
never
have
anything
more
to
do
with
me
no
never
but
she
was
most
offended
because
i
told
her
that
it
was
wrong
of
her
not
to
admit
that
she
had
chattered
in
school
she
said
quite
sarcastically
that
if
i
chose
to
correct
her
on
account
of
that
raggedy
loneli
i
should
keep
loneli
for
a
friend
and
not
her
let
her
be
for
once
said
the
mother
till
now
you
have
always
gone
after
her
so
do
what
she
wishes
this
time
it
is
wrong
to
call
loneli
raggedy
few
people
are
as
honest
and
agreeable
as
apollonie
and
her
grandchild
mea
was
ready
with
many
more
complaints
for
whenever
anything
bothered
her
she
felt
the
need
to
tell
her
mother
she
realized
though
that
she
had
to
put
off
further
communications
for
a
quiet
evening
hour
bruno
had
approached
and
turning
to
his
mother
asked
in
great
suspense
mother
what
did
rector
write
to
you
have
the
been
discovered
i
do
not
think
that
they
have
brought
his
decision
about
but
i
am
sure
they
hastened
it
read
the
letter
said
his
mother
handing
it
to
him
that
is
not
so
bad
bruno
said
after
reading
it
as
soon
as
you
send
me
to
town
i
shall
be
rid
of
them
at
last
and
i
wo
have
to
bother
about
them
any
more
you
know
mother
that
all
they
care
about
is
to
do
mean
and
nasty
things
but
they
will
go
to
town
too
and
then
you
will
be
thrown
together
there
wo
be
anybody
then
who
cares
for
you
and
will
listen
to
you
the
mother
lamented
do
not
worry
mother
the
town
is
big
and
we
wo
be
so
close
together
i
keep
far
enough
away
from
them
you
may
be
sure
do
let
it
trouble
you
bruno
reassured
her
kurt
was
so
much
occupied
at
lunch
with
his
own
plans
and
ideas
that
he
never
even
noticed
when
his
favorite
dessert
appeared
on
the
table
lippo
seriously
looking
at
him
said
quite
reproachfully
now
you
even
see
that
we
have
such
an
indifference
seemed
wrong
to
the
little
boy
but
kurt
even
swallowed
the
after
lunch
he
begged
his
mother
permission
to
be
allowed
to
leave
immediately
because
he
still
had
so
much
to
talk
over
with
his
friends
i
tell
you
all
about
it
afterwards
mother
be
sure
that
i
am
doing
something
right
that
ought
to
be
done
he
reassured
her
if
only
i
can
go
now
having
obtained
permission
he
shot
away
and
arriving
at
the
flew
into
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
boys
but
before
their
plan
could
be
carried
out
the
children
were
obliged
to
sit
two
whole
hours
on
the
it
truly
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
end
lux
the
sexton
boy
who
preferred
pulling
the
and
being
violently
drawn
up
by
it
to
sitting
in
school
tapped
his
sleeve
how
late
is
it
max
he
asked
i
do
know
max
lux
whispered
again
the
second
expedition
will
be
more
fun
than
the
first
i
look
forward
to
it
more
do
you
you
can
look
forward
to
the
if
you
do
keep
quiet
max
retorted
squinting
with
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
teacher
the
latter
had
actually
directed
his
eyes
to
the
side
where
the
whisperers
sat
lux
bending
over
his
book
kept
quiet
at
last
finally
the
hour
came
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
swarm
was
outside
with
a
great
deal
of
noise
but
in
a
quick
and
pretty
orderly
fashion
they
now
formed
a
procession
which
began
to
move
in
the
direction
of
apollonie
little
house
here
a
halt
was
made
kurt
climbing
to
the
top
of
a
heap
of
logs
which
lay
in
the
pathway
stood
upright
while
the
others
grouped
themselves
about
him
apollonie
opened
the
window
a
little
but
hid
behind
it
for
she
was
wondering
what
was
going
on
loneli
stood
close
behind
her
she
had
just
come
back
breathlessly
for
she
had
heard
that
a
procession
was
coming
towards
her
grandmother
house
apollonie
kurt
cried
out
with
loud
voice
two
whole
classes
from
school
have
come
to
you
to
tell
you
that
it
was
not
loneli
fault
when
she
had
to
sit
on
the
it
only
happened
because
her
character
is
so
good
out
of
pure
politeness
she
answered
a
question
somebody
asked
her
when
the
teacher
wanted
to
know
who
was
chattering
she
honestly
accused
herself
she
did
not
tell
him
that
she
answered
a
question
in
fear
of
accusing
somebody
else
we
wanted
to
tell
you
all
about
it
so
that
you
wo
think
you
have
to
be
ashamed
of
loneli
we
think
and
know
that
she
is
the
friendliest
and
most
obliging
child
in
school
long
live
loneli
lux
suddenly
cheered
so
that
the
whole
band
involuntarily
joined
him
long
live
loneli
it
sounded
again
and
the
echo
from
the
repeated
loneli
apollonie
opened
the
window
completely
and
putting
out
her
head
cried
it
is
lovely
of
you
children
that
you
do
want
loneli
disgraced
i
thank
you
for
justifying
her
wait
a
minute
i
should
like
to
do
you
a
favor
too
with
that
apollonie
disappeared
from
the
window
soon
after
she
came
out
by
the
door
with
a
large
basket
of
fragrant
apples
on
her
arm
putting
it
in
front
of
the
children
she
said
encouragingly
help
yourselves
good
gracious
cried
out
lux
with
one
of
the
juicy
apples
between
his
teeth
i
know
these
they
only
grow
in
the
on
the
two
trees
on
the
right
in
the
corner
by
the
fence
do
you
know
that
kurt
he
said
confidentially
i
only
wonder
how
she
could
get
hold
of
such
a
basket
full
you
know
without
being
you
know
with
this
he
made
the
unmistakable
motion
of
trius
with
his
tool
of
correction
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
kurt
cried
out
full
of
indignation
apollonie
did
not
need
to
steal
them
trius
certainly
could
give
her
a
few
baskets
of
apples
for
all
the
shirts
she
sews
and
mends
for
him
oh
i
see
that
is
different
said
lux
now
properly
informed
in
the
shortest
time
the
huge
basket
was
emptied
of
its
delicious
apples
and
the
whole
band
had
dispersed
after
many
exclamations
of
thanks
they
all
ran
home
and
kurt
outran
them
all
it
was
important
now
to
do
his
as
speedily
as
possible
as
the
second
expedition
was
to
take
place
a
little
later
when
he
reached
the
front
door
he
noticed
that
knippel
was
coming
up
behind
him
running
ahead
quickly
he
flung
open
the
door
and
called
in
take
mäzli
out
of
the
way
or
else
something
horrible
will
happen
again
after
saying
this
he
ran
away
bruno
and
mea
who
were
busy
in
the
room
with
their
work
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
follow
kurt
command
if
he
found
it
so
necessary
why
did
he
do
it
himself
they
thought
remaining
seated
mäzli
had
risen
rapidly
and
looked
towards
the
door
with
large
expectant
eyes
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
knippel
now
entered
why
does
something
horrible
always
happen
when
knippel
comes
mäzli
asked
in
a
loud
voice
mea
quickly
getting
up
went
out
of
the
door
pulling
mäzli
after
her
to
explain
her
hasty
retreat
she
said
that
she
wanted
to
fetch
her
mother
she
simply
had
to
take
that
horrible
little
mäzli
out
of
the
way
who
could
know
what
she
might
say
next
she
always
brought
forward
her
most
awful
ideas
when
it
was
least
suitable
the
mother
who
was
on
the
way
already
entered
just
when
mea
was
running
out
with
mäzli
bruno
also
slipped
quickly
after
them
he
had
only
waited
for
his
appearance
in
order
to
fly
your
children
are
certainly
very
peculiar
the
district
attorney
wife
began
i
have
to
think
so
every
time
i
see
them
what
do
all
your
admonitions
help
i
should
like
to
know
nature
will
have
its
way
not
one
of
my
children
has
ever
been
so
impertinent
to
say
the
least
as
your
little
daughter
is
already
i
am
very
sorry
you
should
have
to
tell
me
that
maxa
replied
is
it
possible
that
the
child
should
have
unconsciously
said
an
impertinence
i
hope
you
have
never
had
a
similar
experience
with
my
older
children
no
i
could
not
say
that
knippel
answered
but
i
should
say
that
all
of
them
have
inherited
the
love
of
preaching
especially
your
daughter
mea
children
can
be
unlike
by
disposition
without
its
being
necessary
that
one
of
them
should
constantly
make
sermons
to
the
other
my
children
are
very
often
of
different
opinions
but
i
could
not
say
that
they
preach
much
to
each
other
said
maxa
it
is
certainly
mea
habit
to
do
so
and
that
is
why
she
is
not
able
to
keep
peace
with
her
friends
i
suppose
you
received
a
letter
from
our
rector
telling
you
of
the
refusal
to
teach
the
boys
any
further
this
was
said
with
a
less
severe
intonation
maxa
confirmed
the
statement
so
the
change
we
have
looked
forward
to
has
really
come
the
visitor
continued
and
my
husband
agrees
with
me
that
prompt
action
should
be
taken
he
is
going
to
the
city
in
fact
he
has
left
already
in
order
to
visit
his
sister
on
the
way
he
will
look
for
a
suitable
attractive
home
in
town
that
the
three
boys
can
move
into
next
fall
you
do
not
mean
to
tell
me
knippel
that
your
husband
is
ordering
for
bruno
too
maxa
said
in
consternation
oh
yes
and
this
is
why
my
husband
has
sent
me
here
to
let
you
know
how
glad
he
is
to
do
it
for
you
the
attorney
wife
said
soothingly
he
was
positively
sure
that
you
would
be
glad
if
he
decided
and
ordered
everything
to
suit
himself
and
you
but
knippel
i
am
not
prepared
for
this
i
have
not
even
spoken
to
my
brother
about
it
you
know
very
well
that
he
is
the
guardian
maxa
was
quite
unable
to
hide
her
excitement
you
can
be
reassured
for
we
have
thought
of
that
too
the
visitor
said
with
a
slightly
superior
smile
my
husband
sister
does
not
live
very
far
from
falcon
in
sils
so
he
planned
to
visit
your
brother
and
talk
the
plan
over
with
him
this
calmed
maxa
a
trifle
for
her
brother
knew
already
how
it
stood
between
the
three
comrades
and
how
little
she
wanted
them
to
live
together
but
she
could
not
help
wondering
why
these
people
were
trying
to
force
the
boys
to
live
together
i
do
not
really
understand
why
the
boys
should
have
to
live
together
she
said
with
animation
they
do
not
profess
to
feel
much
friendship
for
each
other
and
never
seek
each
other
out
you
yourself
knippel
do
not
seem
to
get
a
very
good
impression
from
my
children
ways
i
do
not
see
why
you
wish
your
sons
to
live
with
mine
at
all
it
is
a
matter
of
decorum
the
attorney
wife
replied
and
my
husband
agrees
with
me
what
would
people
in
town
say
if
the
sons
of
the
two
best
families
here
who
have
always
studied
together
should
not
live
together
everybody
would
think
that
something
special
had
happened
between
the
families
both
parties
will
only
gain
in
respect
by
joining
i
do
not
believe
that
people
in
the
city
will
be
interested
in
what
the
three
boys
are
doing
said
maxa
smiling
a
little
that
same
moment
the
door
was
flung
wide
open
with
a
triumphant
face
as
if
she
wanted
to
say
just
look
whom
i
bring
you
here
mäzli
stood
on
the
threshhold
leading
apollonie
in
the
latter
hastily
retreated
no
no
mäzli
she
said
quite
frightened
you
should
have
told
me
that
there
was
company
knippel
had
risen
to
take
her
departure
it
seems
to
me
that
other
visitors
are
greeted
very
joyfully
by
your
children
well
i
must
say
they
have
rather
odd
tastes
she
said
walking
towards
the
door
apollonie
is
a
very
old
friend
of
ours
all
the
children
love
her
very
much
they
may
have
inherited
this
attachment
though
maxa
replied
with
a
smile
i
only
want
to
say
one
more
word
said
the
lady
turning
round
before
stepping
outside
the
door
the
scene
your
son
kurt
enacted
in
front
of
apollonie
cottage
with
his
crowd
of
miscellaneous
friends
can
only
be
called
a
vulgar
noise
but
maxa
did
not
yet
know
what
kurt
had
done
the
visitor
turned
to
go
now
as
it
seemed
not
worth
her
while
to
waste
words
about
it
as
soon
as
the
field
was
clear
mäzli
rushed
out
of
a
pulling
apollonie
with
her
the
old
woman
was
terribly
apologetic
about
having
gone
into
the
room
when
she
had
told
mäzli
that
she
wanted
to
see
her
mother
the
little
girl
had
taken
her
there
without
any
further
ado
she
informed
the
rector
widow
that
she
had
come
to
her
with
a
quite
incredible
communication
maxa
found
it
necessary
at
this
point
to
interrupt
her
friend
she
had
noticed
that
mäzli
was
all
ears
to
what
was
coming
mäzli
go
and
play
with
lippo
till
i
come
she
said
please
tell
me
all
about
it
afterwards
apollonie
was
instruction
before
going
to
do
as
she
was
bid
apollonie
communication
took
a
considerable
time
she
had
just
left
when
the
family
sat
down
to
a
belated
supper
kurt
swallowed
his
meal
with
signs
of
immoderate
impatience
as
soon
as
possible
he
rushed
away
after
having
given
his
promise
not
to
come
home
late
the
friends
that
were
to
join
him
in
this
expedition
had
to
be
sought
out
first
when
he
neared
the
meeting
place
he
felt
a
little
disappointed
in
the
twilight
he
could
see
that
there
was
a
smaller
number
assembled
than
he
had
hoped
for
this
certainly
was
not
the
crowd
he
had
had
together
at
noon
when
at
least
all
the
boys
had
promised
to
take
part
in
his
new
enterprise
they
were
afraid
they
were
afraid
all
voices
cried
together
kurt
heard
now
while
each
screamed
louder
than
the
other
that
many
boys
and
girls
had
left
when
the
darkness
was
beginning
to
fall
among
the
few
that
were
left
there
were
only
four
girls
it
does
matter
said
kurt
there
are
enough
people
still
whoever
is
afraid
may
leave
we
must
start
though
because
we
have
rather
far
to
go
we
are
not
going
up
the
path
because
trius
watches
for
there
till
midnight
i
think
that
suits
us
exactly
for
he
must
not
hear
us
we
are
going
up
to
the
woods
at
the
back
of
the
castle
first
we
sing
our
challenge
then
comes
the
pause
to
give
the
ghost
enough
time
then
again
and
after
that
for
the
third
and
last
time
if
there
really
is
a
ghost
he
will
have
appeared
by
then
you
can
understand
that
he
wo
let
himself
be
teased
by
us
so
when
he
has
come
we
can
tell
everybody
what
we
did
then
see
that
it
is
only
a
superstition
and
that
there
is
no
wandering
ghost
in
wildenstein
forward
now
the
little
crowd
set
out
full
of
spirits
and
eagerness
for
the
adventure
for
kurt
had
clearly
shown
them
that
there
could
be
no
ghost
to
go
up
there
and
sing
loudly
to
a
ghost
was
capital
fun
furthermore
they
looked
forward
to
boasting
of
their
daring
deed
afterwards
faster
and
faster
they
climbed
so
that
only
half
of
the
usual
time
was
taken
in
reaching
their
destination
it
was
dark
at
first
but
the
moon
suddenly
came
out
from
behind
the
clouds
cheerfully
lighting
up
the
fields
having
reached
the
rear
of
the
castle
hill
they
hurried
up
the
incline
and
into
the
pinewoods
where
the
trees
stood
extremely
close
together
this
made
it
very
dark
despite
the
fact
that
the
wood
was
small
soon
clouds
covered
the
moon
and
the
little
band
became
stiller
and
stiller
here
and
there
one
of
the
children
sneaked
off
and
did
not
reappear
three
of
the
girls
after
mysteriously
whispering
together
were
gone
too
and
with
them
several
more
stole
away
for
there
was
a
strange
rustling
in
the
bushes
kurt
with
lux
and
his
enterprising
sister
clevi
were
at
the
extreme
front
when
it
became
very
still
kurt
turned
around
come
along
where
are
you
all
he
called
back
we
are
coming
several
voices
answered
from
some
children
immediately
behind
him
it
was
max
hans
and
simi
and
then
stoffi
and
rudi
behind
them
but
they
were
all
kurt
halted
where
is
the
whole
troup
asked
kurt
let
us
wait
till
they
catch
up
we
must
all
stay
together
up
there
but
none
followed
all
the
answer
kurt
got
to
his
question
was
the
screaching
of
an
owl
oh
they
gone
they
were
afraid
said
max
they
were
there
though
when
we
came
into
the
woods
the
cowards
clevi
cried
indignantly
to
be
afraid
of
trees
that
certainly
is
funny
well
we
are
afraid
anyway
otherwise
we
should
be
here
any
more
call
to
those
who
are
gone
max
called
back
come
on
now
come
kurt
commanded
there
are
eight
of
us
left
to
sing
so
we
must
all
sing
very
loud
on
they
went
speedily
till
they
could
see
the
end
of
the
woods
one
of
the
gray
towers
was
peering
between
the
trees
they
had
at
last
reached
their
goal
here
we
stop
said
kurt
but
we
must
not
go
outside
the
woods
the
wildenstein
ghost
might
otherwise
step
up
to
us
if
he
walks
around
the
terrace
here
we
go
kurt
began
and
all
the
others
vigorously
joined
him
come
out
you
ghost
of
wildenstein
for
we
are
not
afraid
we
come
here
in
the
bright
moonshine
to
sing
the
song
we
made
come
out
come
out
and
leave
your
den
you
never
scare
the
folks
again
everything
was
quiet
roundabout
only
the
night
wind
was
soughing
in
the
old
between
them
there
was
a
clear
view
of
the
terrace
which
the
moon
was
now
flooding
with
light
the
space
before
the
castle
lay
peaceful
and
deserted
we
must
sing
again
said
kurt
he
did
hear
us
if
he
does
give
us
an
answer
this
time
we
tell
him
what
we
know
then
we
sing
fearfully
loud
hurrah
we
have
a
certain
sign
there
is
no
ghost
in
wildenstein
then
we
start
again
clevi
who
was
gifted
with
a
voice
began
come
out
you
ghost
of
wildenstein
and
the
boys
with
voices
of
thunder
chimed
in
for
we
are
not
afraid
just
look
who
is
coming
there
who
can
it
be
said
kurt
staring
at
the
terrace
an
incredibly
tall
figure
which
could
not
possibly
be
human
was
wandering
across
the
terrace
with
slow
steps
it
could
not
be
a
tree
either
for
it
slowly
moved
over
towards
the
woods
did
he
really
see
straight
or
was
it
the
moonlight
which
was
throwing
a
flitting
shadow
that
moment
max
who
was
very
big
turned
about
and
fled
the
four
others
followed
headlong
leaving
only
lux
and
clevi
beside
kurt
the
horrible
figure
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
it
could
now
be
clearly
discerned
full
moonlight
fell
on
the
armor
he
was
garbed
in
and
made
it
as
well
as
the
high
helmet
with
waving
plumes
glitter
brightly
a
long
mantle
fell
from
his
shoulders
down
to
his
high
riding
boots
half
hiding
his
fearful
figure
could
this
be
a
human
creature
no
impossible
no
living
man
could
be
as
enormous
as
that
with
measured
steps
the
apparition
walked
silently
towards
the
pine
trees
here
the
three
singers
stood
not
uttering
a
sound
lux
like
one
crazed
suddenly
rushed
headlong
away
between
the
trees
and
down
the
hill
clevi
once
more
looked
at
the
approaching
figure
with
eyes
before
following
her
brother
she
wanted
to
see
exactly
what
the
knight
looked
like
kurt
was
left
quite
alone
and
still
the
fearful
creature
stalked
nearer
with
a
desperate
leap
he
sprang
to
one
side
and
left
the
woods
abruptly
hurrying
towards
the
meadow
he
ran
down
the
mountain
leaped
over
first
one
hedge
and
then
a
second
then
he
flew
on
till
he
stood
in
the
little
garden
at
home
where
a
peaceful
light
from
the
seemed
to
greet
him
breathing
deeply
he
ran
in
and
his
mother
met
him
at
the
door
oh
is
it
you
kurt
she
said
kindly
but
you
are
a
little
late
after
all
was
it
so
hard
to
leave
the
beautiful
moonlight
or
was
it
such
fun
rushing
about
but
kurt
you
are
entirely
out
of
breath
come
sit
down
a
moment
with
me
after
that
you
have
to
go
to
bed
all
the
others
have
gone
already
usually
kurt
would
have
adored
being
able
to
sit
alone
with
his
mother
and
have
all
her
attention
directed
towards
him
this
he
could
not
enjoy
now
might
not
his
mother
ask
him
further
details
about
his
walk
so
he
said
that
he
preferred
to
go
to
bed
right
away
and
his
mother
understood
that
he
was
glad
to
get
to
rest
after
running
about
so
ceaselessly
only
when
kurt
lay
safely
and
quietly
in
bed
could
he
think
over
what
had
happened
and
how
cowardly
he
had
acted
after
all
his
mother
had
clearly
told
him
that
there
was
no
ghost
in
wildenstein
whom
then
had
he
seen
in
armor
and
helmet
and
with
a
long
mantle
it
could
not
have
been
trius
because
he
was
a
short
stout
person
whereas
the
apparition
was
a
figure
might
it
be
a
sentinel
at
the
castle
who
was
ordered
to
go
about
may
be
the
old
had
always
wished
an
armed
sentinel
to
keep
watch
if
only
he
had
not
run
away
he
could
have
let
the
sentinel
walk
up
to
him
and
then
he
could
have
told
him
of
his
intention
the
sentinel
could
only
have
been
pleased
by
his
endeavor
to
get
rid
of
such
an
old
superstition
if
only
he
had
not
run
away
oh
yes
now
that
kurt
was
safely
under
cover
and
bruno
breathing
beside
him
spoke
of
his
big
brother
nearness
it
seemed
easy
enough
to
act
bravely
if
only
he
had
done
it
the
thing
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
was
how
anybody
could
be
so
horribly
tall
that
was
hardly
credible
kurt
felt
at
bottom
quite
sure
that
it
was
impossible
for
anybody
to
look
like
that
if
only
i
could
have
told
mother
about
it
he
sighed
but
he
felt
dreadfully
ashamed
she
had
absolutely
forbidden
him
troubling
himself
about
this
matter
even
with
his
intention
to
get
rid
of
the
talk
he
had
acted
against
her
command
well
and
what
had
he
accomplished
more
than
ever
the
whole
village
would
say
that
the
ghost
of
wildenstein
was
wandering
about
again
furthermore
he
did
not
know
how
to
gainsay
it
if
it
only
had
not
been
so
huge
when
the
mother
stepped
up
to
her
children
bedside
later
on
as
usual
she
stopped
a
little
while
before
kurt
hearing
him
moaning
in
his
sleep
she
thought
he
was
kurt
she
said
quietly
does
something
hurt
you
he
woke
up
oh
mother
he
said
seizing
her
hand
is
it
you
i
thought
the
ghost
of
wildenstein
was
stretching
out
his
enormous
arm
towards
me
you
were
dreaming
do
think
about
such
things
in
daytime
the
mother
said
kindly
have
you
forgotten
your
evening
prayer
after
the
excitements
of
the
day
yes
i
had
so
much
to
think
about
that
i
forgot
it
kurt
admitted
say
it
now
then
you
will
fall
asleep
more
quietly
said
the
mother
but
please
kurt
never
forget
that
god
hears
our
prayers
and
comforts
and
calms
us
only
when
we
open
our
hearts
entirely
to
him
you
know
kurt
do
you
that
we
must
hide
nothing
from
him
kurt
moaned
yes
in
a
very
low
voice
after
giving
him
a
kiss
the
mother
withdrew
chapter
v
oppressive
air
it
seemed
as
if
for
several
days
a
heavy
atmosphere
was
weighing
down
the
limbs
of
all
maxa
household
so
that
its
wonted
cheerfulness
was
entirely
absent
even
the
mother
went
about
more
silently
than
usual
for
the
worry
about
bruno
future
weighed
heavily
on
her
heart
she
had
written
to
her
brother
to
come
to
her
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
they
could
talk
the
matter
over
and
come
to
a
united
decision
he
had
answered
her
that
urgent
business
was
forcing
him
to
a
journey
to
south
germany
and
that
it
would
be
time
enough
to
settle
the
matter
after
his
return
bruno
having
heard
about
the
situation
was
already
wrought
up
by
the
mere
possibility
of
his
being
obliged
to
live
with
the
two
boys
secretly
he
was
already
making
the
wildest
plans
in
order
to
escape
such
an
intolerable
situation
why
should
he
simply
disappear
and
go
to
spain
like
the
young
baron
of
wallerstätten
probably
the
young
gentleman
had
had
some
money
to
dispose
of
while
he
had
none
he
might
hire
himself
out
as
a
sailor
however
and
travel
to
china
or
australia
he
might
study
the
inhabitants
and
peculiarities
of
these
countries
and
write
famous
books
about
them
in
that
way
he
could
make
a
good
livelihood
might
he
not
join
a
band
of
wandering
singers
his
mother
had
already
told
him
how
well
his
voice
sounded
and
that
she
wanted
him
to
develop
it
later
on
with
wrinkled
brows
bruno
sat
about
whole
evenings
not
saying
one
word
but
meditating
on
his
schemes
he
found
it
extremely
hard
to
tell
which
one
of
them
was
best
and
to
think
of
means
to
carry
it
out
mea
forehead
also
was
darkened
by
heavy
clouds
but
she
was
not
as
silent
as
her
brother
every
few
moments
exclamations
of
pain
or
indignation
escaped
her
but
had
she
not
fared
badly
when
they
had
moved
from
sils
to
nolla
elvira
had
immediately
approached
mea
as
if
she
wanted
to
become
her
friend
knippel
had
sent
her
an
invitation
in
order
to
cement
the
bonds
of
friendship
and
she
had
done
the
same
with
bruno
who
was
to
become
her
sons
close
comrade
it
was
quite
true
that
bruno
had
declared
from
the
beginning
that
he
would
not
make
friends
with
the
two
who
were
to
share
his
studies
and
every
time
they
came
together
fights
and
quarrels
were
the
result
but
mea
had
a
heart
which
craved
friendship
she
was
overcome
with
happiness
by
the
advances
of
the
knippel
family
and
immediately
gave
herself
to
her
new
friend
with
absolute
confidence
and
warm
love
soon
many
differences
of
opinion
and
of
natural
disposition
showed
themselves
in
the
two
girls
but
mea
in
her
overflowing
joy
of
having
found
a
friend
was
little
troubled
by
this
at
first
she
thought
that
all
these
things
would
come
right
by
and
by
when
they
came
closer
to
each
other
she
hoped
that
the
desired
harmony
would
come
when
they
became
better
acquainted
but
the
more
the
two
girls
got
to
know
know
each
other
the
deeper
their
differences
grew
and
every
attempt
at
a
clear
understanding
only
ended
in
a
wider
estrangement
maxa
had
always
tried
to
fill
her
children
with
a
contempt
not
only
of
all
wrong
but
also
of
low
and
ugly
actions
she
had
made
an
effort
to
keep
her
children
from
harmful
influences
and
to
implant
in
them
a
hate
for
these
things
whenever
mea
found
elvira
of
a
different
opinion
in
such
matters
she
was
assured
that
she
was
in
the
right
by
the
mother
opinion
which
coincided
with
her
own
so
she
felt
as
if
elvira
should
be
shown
the
right
way
too
whenever
this
happened
elvira
turned
from
her
and
told
her
that
she
wanted
to
hear
no
sermons
so
the
two
had
not
yet
become
friends
despite
the
fact
that
mea
was
still
hoping
and
wishing
for
it
and
her
brother
kurt
had
proved
himself
in
the
right
when
he
had
doubted
it
from
the
beginning
since
the
incident
with
loneli
when
mea
had
told
her
friend
her
opinion
in
perfectly
good
faith
elvira
had
not
spoken
to
her
any
more
and
had
remained
angry
but
mea
nature
was
not
inclined
to
sulk
whenever
she
felt
herself
injured
words
of
indignation
poured
out
from
her
like
fiery
lava
from
a
crater
after
that
everything
was
settled
she
had
been
obliged
to
sit
day
after
day
on
the
same
bench
with
the
sulking
girl
and
to
come
to
school
and
leave
again
without
saying
a
word
should
this
situation
which
had
already
become
intolerable
to
her
continue
forever
mea
could
only
moan
with
this
prospect
in
view
she
was
glad
that
kurt
was
in
a
strangely
depressed
mood
too
and
hardly
ever
spoke
he
would
otherwise
have
been
sure
to
make
several
horrible
songs
about
her
experiences
with
the
moping
elvira
kurt
who
was
usually
cheerful
had
been
as
terribly
depressed
for
the
last
few
days
as
if
he
had
been
carrying
a
heavy
weight
around
with
him
all
the
time
he
had
kept
something
from
his
mother
and
therefore
the
weight
seemed
to
get
heavier
and
heavier
it
oppressed
kurt
more
than
he
could
say
that
he
had
not
immediately
confessed
his
fault
but
how
could
the
mother
have
believed
him
when
he
told
her
that
he
had
seen
a
figure
which
could
not
possibly
be
human
he
really
felt
like
a
traitor
towards
his
mother
all
people
in
nolla
believed
anew
that
a
ghost
of
wildenstein
went
about
for
the
apparition
had
actually
been
seen
kurt
knew
quite
well
that
it
was
all
his
fault
he
hardly
dared
to
look
at
his
mother
and
he
longed
for
somebody
to
help
him
he
was
filled
with
the
craving
to
be
happy
again
only
lippo
and
mäzli
pursued
their
usual
occupations
and
were
untroubled
by
heavy
thoughts
as
soon
as
mäzli
noticed
that
the
usual
cheerfulness
had
departed
from
the
house
she
tried
to
get
into
a
different
atmosphere
at
once
she
always
knew
a
place
of
refuge
in
such
a
case
oh
mama
i
have
to
go
and
see
apollonie
she
would
repeatedly
say
with
firm
conviction
to
her
mother
having
the
greatest
confidence
in
guarding
hand
and
knowing
besides
that
mäzli
visits
always
were
welcome
the
mother
often
let
her
youngest
go
there
the
little
girl
was
well
able
to
find
her
way
to
the
cottage
and
always
went
without
attempting
any
digressions
from
the
path
in
the
evening
loneli
generally
accompanied
her
home
mäzli
would
arrive
carrying
a
large
bunch
of
flowers
the
inevitable
gift
from
apollonie
presenting
them
to
her
mother
she
would
shout
there
they
are
again
just
look
i
have
some
for
you
again
mother
the
mother
then
looked
full
of
delight
at
the
bunch
and
said
yes
those
are
the
same
lovely
mignonette
that
used
to
grow
in
the
apollonie
has
transplanted
them
into
her
own
but
they
were
much
finer
in
the
castle
nowhere
could
their
equal
have
been
found
she
concluded
inhaling
the
delicious
fragrance
of
the
flowers
mäzli
promptly
poked
her
little
nose
into
the
bouquet
uttering
an
exclamation
of
unspeakable
delight
loneli
eyes
were
very
merry
again
and
was
full
of
her
usual
gaiety
since
kurt
had
made
his
little
speech
and
had
rehabilitated
honour
before
the
school
children
the
grandmother
was
as
kind
to
her
as
of
yore
and
never
mentioned
the
again
loneli
heart
was
simply
filled
with
gratefulness
for
what
he
had
done
and
she
often
wished
in
turn
for
an
opportunity
to
help
him
out
of
some
trouble
she
had
noticed
that
kurt
was
no
longer
the
merriest
and
most
entertaining
of
the
children
and
had
given
up
being
their
leader
in
all
gay
undertakings
what
could
be
the
matter
loneli
hated
to
see
him
that
way
and
could
not
help
pondering
about
this
remarkable
change
being
extremely
observant
she
had
noticed
that
it
was
very
hard
to
find
out
the
truth
about
the
night
expedition
to
the
castle
all
the
boys
answers
consisted
in
dark
allusions
to
the
fact
that
the
ghost
was
wandering
about
wildenstein
more
than
ever
as
not
one
of
them
wanted
to
admit
the
hasty
retreat
before
the
ghost
had
even
been
properly
inspected
they
only
dropped
vague
and
terrifying
words
about
the
matter
brave
little
clevi
who
usually
relished
telling
of
her
dangerous
adventures
when
they
had
turned
out
well
was
as
silent
as
a
mouse
about
it
all
whenever
loneli
asked
her
a
straight
question
needing
a
straight
answer
clevi
ran
away
and
loneli
got
none
the
report
was
sure
to
have
some
foundation
and
the
most
noticeable
thing
of
all
was
that
change
had
come
since
that
night
that
same
day
he
had
taken
the
load
off
her
heart
and
had
been
so
gay
and
merry
so
loneli
put
two
and
two
together
and
having
made
these
observations
was
filled
with
sudden
wrath
as
soon
as
school
was
ended
she
rushed
to
the
astonished
clevi
oh
i
know
what
you
have
done
clevi
kurt
was
your
leader
and
you
did
obey
him
you
all
ran
away
because
you
were
afraid
oh
you
have
spoiled
it
all
for
him
yes
and
what
about
him
he
was
afraid
himself
clevi
cried
out
excitedly
for
the
reproach
had
stung
her
i
could
see
with
what
terrified
bounds
he
flew
down
the
was
he
afraid
too
do
you
really
mean
but
of
what
loneli
questioned
further
of
what
that
is
easily
said
of
what
you
ought
to
have
seen
that
huge
creature
coming
towards
us
from
the
castle
since
it
had
come
out
that
they
had
been
so
frightened
clevi
now
told
in
detail
about
the
horribly
tall
armoured
knight
with
the
high
boots
and
the
long
cloak
hanging
down
to
his
was
the
mantle
blue
loneli
who
had
been
listening
intensely
interrupted
it
was
and
you
can
imagine
we
did
not
see
the
color
clearly
clevi
said
indignantly
but
the
color
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
was
the
length
the
horrible
horrible
length
of
that
thing
it
looked
just
too
awful
he
had
a
high
helmet
on
his
head
besides
with
a
still
higher
bunch
of
black
plumes
that
nodded
in
the
most
frightful
way
a
gleam
of
joy
sparkled
in
loneli
eyes
flying
away
like
an
arrow
she
sought
out
maxa
house
kurt
was
standing
at
the
hawthorn
hedge
in
front
of
the
garden
with
his
schoolbag
still
slung
around
him
he
had
not
rushed
in
ahead
of
the
others
according
to
his
custom
with
puckered
brow
he
was
pulling
one
leaf
after
another
from
the
hedge
then
he
flung
them
all
away
as
if
he
wanted
with
each
to
rid
himself
of
a
disagreeable
thought
kurt
loneli
called
to
him
please
wait
a
moment
do
go
in
yet
for
i
want
to
tell
you
something
when
loneli
stood
beside
kurt
she
was
suddenly
filled
with
embarrassment
she
knew
exactly
what
she
had
to
say
but
it
would
sound
as
if
she
was
trying
to
examine
kurt
this
kept
her
from
beginning
tell
me
what
you
want
loneli
kurt
encouraged
her
when
he
saw
her
hesitation
so
loneli
began
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
if
oh
kurt
are
you
so
sad
on
account
of
what
happened
at
the
castle
and
because
you
thought
there
was
no
ghost
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
more
about
it
kurt
said
evasively
pulling
a
handful
of
leaves
from
the
hedge
and
throwing
them
angrily
to
the
ground
but
it
might
only
have
been
a
man
after
all
loneli
continued
quietly
yes
yes
that
is
easily
said
loneli
how
can
you
talk
when
you
have
even
seen
him
kurt
flung
the
last
leaves
away
impatiently
and
tried
to
go
but
loneli
would
not
yield
just
wait
a
moment
kurt
she
entreated
it
is
true
that
i
did
not
see
him
but
clevi
told
me
all
about
him
i
know
why
he
looked
that
way
and
why
he
was
so
enormous
i
also
know
where
he
got
the
armour
the
long
blue
mantle
and
the
high
black
plumes
what
kurt
exclaimed
staring
at
loneli
as
if
she
were
a
curious
ghost
herself
how
can
you
know
anything
about
it
certainly
i
know
about
it
loneli
assured
him
listen
you
must
remember
that
grandmother
lived
a
long
time
at
the
castle
so
she
has
told
me
everything
that
went
on
up
there
in
the
lowest
story
there
is
a
huge
old
hall
and
the
walls
are
covered
with
weapons
and
things
like
armour
and
helmets
in
one
corner
there
is
an
armoured
knight
with
a
helmet
on
his
head
whenever
the
young
gentlemen
from
the
castle
wanted
to
play
a
special
prank
one
of
them
would
take
the
knight
on
his
shoulders
and
the
knightly
long
mantle
would
be
hung
over
his
shoulders
so
as
to
cover
him
down
to
his
high
this
figure
looked
so
terrible
coming
along
the
terrace
that
everybody
always
ran
away
even
in
bright
daylight
once
the
two
young
ladies
shrieked
loudly
when
they
suddenly
saw
the
fearful
knight
that
pleased
the
young
gentlemen
more
than
anything
oh
then
my
mother
saw
him
too
and
knows
what
he
looks
like
kurt
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
start
for
he
had
been
breathlessly
listening
certainly
for
she
was
one
of
the
young
ladies
loneli
said
but
now
nobody
is
at
the
castle
except
trius
and
he
could
have
been
there
kurt
objected
i
know
that
he
sneaks
about
the
meadows
till
late
in
the
evening
in
order
to
catch
that
is
so
far
from
the
little
woods
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
heard
us
but
it
was
trius
just
the
same
you
can
believe
me
kurt
loneli
assured
her
friend
my
grandmother
has
often
said
that
trius
always
knows
everything
that
is
going
on
he
seems
to
hide
behind
the
hedges
and
then
suddenly
comes
out
from
behind
the
trees
when
one
least
expects
him
you
know
that
the
boys
have
known
about
your
plan
several
days
and
that
they
do
always
talk
in
a
low
voice
besides
they
have
been
trying
to
get
hold
of
apples
every
night
you
can
be
sure
that
trius
heard
distinctly
what
your
plan
was
yes
that
is
true
but
i
have
to
go
to
mother
now
kurt
exclaimed
as
he
started
toward
the
house
then
turning
back
once
more
he
said
thank
you
ever
so
much
loneli
you
have
done
me
a
greater
service
than
you
can
realize
by
telling
me
everything
nothing
could
have
made
me
happier
than
what
you
have
said
as
he
spoke
these
words
he
shook
the
little
girl
hand
with
all
his
might
the
boy
ran
into
the
house
while
loneli
hastened
home
with
leaps
and
bounds
for
her
heart
was
thrilling
with
great
joy
where
is
mother
where
is
mother
kurt
impetuously
asked
lippo
whom
he
met
in
the
hall
carrying
a
large
entrusted
to
him
by
kathy
one
knows
well
enough
where
mama
must
be
when
it
is
nearly
you
came
home
late
from
school
lippo
answered
carefully
trotting
away
with
his
fragile
burden
yes
i
did
you
little
sentinel
of
good
order
kurt
laughed
out
passing
lippo
in
order
to
hasten
to
the
now
kurt
could
laugh
again
oh
are
you
as
far
as
that
already
he
cried
out
in
surprise
when
he
found
everybody
settling
down
to
lunch
what
a
shame
i
wanted
to
tell
you
something
mother
she
gazed
at
him
questioningly
he
had
not
had
any
urgent
news
for
her
lately
and
she
was
glad
to
hear
his
clear
voice
and
see
his
merry
eyes
again
you
must
wait
now
till
after
lunch
kurt
she
said
kindly
for
you
were
rather
late
yes
i
was
rather
slow
at
first
kurt
informed
her
then
loneli
ran
after
me
to
tell
me
something
she
has
found
out
i
have
often
said
before
that
loneli
is
the
most
clever
child
in
all
nolla
besides
being
the
most
friendly
and
obliging
one
could
possibly
find
even
if
she
is
only
brought
up
by
simple
apollonie
she
is
more
refined
at
bottom
than
a
girl
i
know
who
adorns
her
outside
with
the
most
beautiful
ribbons
and
flowers
i
would
rather
have
a
single
loneli
than
a
thousand
elviras
lippo
had
been
anxiously
looking
at
kurt
for
some
time
here
come
the
beans
and
you
have
your
plate
still
full
of
soup
he
said
excitedly
kurt
i
think
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
eat
your
soup
instead
of
uttering
such
strange
speeches
besides
we
all
agree
with
you
about
loneli
i
think
that
she
is
an
unusually
nice
and
sympathetic
child
oh
kurt
the
observant
little
mäzli
exclaimed
do
you
have
to
talk
so
much
all
at
once
because
you
talked
so
little
yesterday
the
day
before
yesterday
and
the
day
before
that
yes
that
is
the
exact
reason
mäzli
kurt
said
with
a
laugh
his
soup
was
soon
eaten
for
his
spirits
had
fully
come
back
now
and
in
the
shortest
time
he
had
emptied
his
plate
kurt
was
only
able
to
get
his
mother
to
himself
after
school
the
elder
children
were
busy
at
that
time
and
the
two
little
ones
had
taken
a
walk
to
apollonie
his
mother
having
clearly
understood
his
wish
to
have
a
thorough
talk
with
her
had
reserved
this
quiet
hour
for
him
kurt
made
an
honest
confession
of
his
disobedience
without
once
excusing
himself
by
saying
that
he
had
only
done
it
to
destroy
all
foolish
superstition
and
by
this
means
to
become
her
helper
he
could
therefore
tell
her
without
reserve
how
terribly
he
had
been
cast
down
the
last
few
days
the
weight
had
been
very
heavy
on
his
heart
before
his
confession
because
he
had
been
so
ashamed
of
the
miserable
end
of
the
undertaking
he
had
moreover
been
very
much
afraid
that
she
would
tell
him
that
no
ghost
of
wildenstein
existed
after
he
himself
had
seen
the
incredible
apparition
what
loneli
had
told
him
had
relieved
him
immensely
now
his
mother
who
had
seen
the
terrible
sight
herself
could
understand
his
fright
oh
little
mother
i
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
me
any
more
kurt
begged
her
heartily
i
shall
never
do
anything
any
more
you
do
want
me
to
for
i
know
now
what
it
feels
like
i
know
that
this
was
my
punishment
for
doing
what
you
had
forbidden
me
to
do
when
his
mother
saw
that
kurt
had
realized
his
mistake
and
had
humbly
borne
the
punishment
she
did
not
scold
him
any
further
she
confirmed
everything
loneli
had
told
him
about
the
knight
she
also
agreed
with
the
little
girl
that
the
watchful
trius
had
probably
discovered
long
ago
what
kurt
had
planned
to
do
that
night
with
the
horrible
apparition
he
had
probably
meant
to
punish
and
banish
the
boys
for
good
oh
kurt
the
mother
concluded
i
hope
i
can
rely
on
you
from
now
on
not
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
matter
of
the
fabulous
ghost
of
wildenstein
kurt
could
give
his
honest
promise
for
he
had
enough
of
his
endeavour
to
prove
the
of
the
ghost
it
put
him
into
the
best
spirits
that
there
had
been
nothing
supernatural
about
it
and
that
he
was
able
again
to
talk
with
his
mother
as
before
with
a
loud
and
jubilant
song
he
joined
his
brothers
and
sisters
maxa
was
also
very
happy
that
kurt
had
regained
his
cheerfulness
what
met
her
ears
now
though
was
not
kurt
singing
but
loud
cries
of
delight
opening
the
door
she
distinguished
the
calls
of
uncle
philip
uncle
philip
so
her
brother
was
near
at
last
her
two
little
ones
who
had
met
with
him
on
their
stroll
home
were
bringing
him
along
all
five
children
shouted
loudly
in
order
to
let
their
uncle
know
how
welcome
he
was
oh
how
glad
i
am
that
you
have
come
at
last
welcome
philip
please
come
in
maxa
called
out
to
him
i
come
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
he
replied
breathing
heavily
he
held
a
child
with
each
hand
and
three
were
between
his
feet
all
welcoming
him
tumultuously
so
that
for
the
moment
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
move
forward
gradually
the
whole
knot
moved
into
the
house
and
towards
the
armchair
here
ten
busy
hands
fastened
him
down
so
that
he
should
not
at
once
get
away
you
rascals
you
the
uncle
said
quite
exhausted
a
man
is
lucky
to
escape
from
you
with
his
life
are
you
trying
to
throttle
your
godfather
lippo
whoever
put
two
fat
little
arms
about
a
neck
like
that
you
seem
to
have
climbed
the
chair
from
behind
and
to
have
only
your
foot
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
if
you
slip
i
shall
be
strangled
who
then
will
find
out
for
whom
i
brought
a
harmonica
buried
in
the
depths
of
my
it
gives
forth
the
most
beautiful
melodies
you
ever
heard
when
you
have
learned
to
play
it
a
harmonica
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
lippo
could
imagine
his
neighbor
in
school
a
little
girl
called
toneli
owned
one
and
could
play
whole
songs
on
it
he
had
always
thought
it
splendid
if
a
harmonica
was
really
destined
for
him
he
had
better
let
go
his
uncle
arm
uncle
philip
dove
into
his
deep
pockets
with
both
hands
and
soon
the
wonderful
coveted
object
really
came
to
light
and
how
much
bigger
and
finer
it
was
than
toneli
little
instrument
such
a
one
must
be
able
to
sound
the
loveliest
tones
lippo
holding
his
treasure
in
his
hand
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
his
own
property
but
uncle
philip
reassured
him
saying
come
lippo
take
it
the
harmonica
is
meant
for
you
there
were
presents
for
all
the
children
in
the
depths
of
the
pockets
and
one
child
after
another
ran
away
to
show
his
gift
to
his
mother
lippo
saw
and
heard
nothing
else
just
then
in
expectation
of
the
melodies
which
would
well
up
he
blew
with
all
his
might
quite
horrible
sounds
lippo
you
must
learn
how
to
play
a
little
first
everything
has
to
be
learned
give
it
to
me
said
uncle
philip
you
see
you
must
do
this
way
setting
the
instrument
to
his
lips
and
pushing
it
up
and
down
he
played
the
merriest
tunes
lippo
looked
up
in
speechless
admiration
at
his
he
was
tremendously
impressed
that
uncle
philip
could
do
everything
even
blow
a
harmonica
which
generally
only
boys
were
able
to
do
how
fine
it
sounded
he
was
sure
that
nobody
else
could
bring
forth
such
beautiful
melodies
lippo
was
interrupted
by
his
brothers
and
sisters
who
were
noisily
announcing
supper
so
uncle
philip
was
taken
in
their
midst
into
the
and
he
might
have
been
likened
to
a
captured
by
the
victors
amidst
shouts
of
triumph
the
mother
had
purposely
ordered
supper
a
little
early
and
she
noticed
that
her
brother
was
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
if
his
intention
had
been
to
shorten
the
time
he
could
have
with
the
children
he
had
no
intention
of
cheating
them
of
amusement
and
he
told
them
so
many
entertaining
things
that
they
felt
they
had
never
had
a
better
time
with
him
at
last
however
it
was
quiet
in
the
uncle
philip
was
sitting
there
alone
waiting
for
his
sister
who
had
gone
upstairs
with
the
children
first
of
all
philip
she
said
on
her
return
as
she
settled
down
beside
him
what
shall
be
done
with
bruno
i
am
sure
you
told
knippel
not
to
engage
board
and
lodging
for
him
on
the
contrary
i
gave
him
full
power
to
do
so
the
brother
replied
knippel
gave
me
the
impression
that
you
would
agree
to
it
and
would
be
very
grateful
if
he
took
the
matter
in
hand
so
i
thought
that
that
would
be
the
simplest
way
out
it
wo
be
so
very
terrible
if
the
boys
live
together
do
always
imagine
the
worst
but
i
must
tell
you
something
else
uncle
philip
seemed
to
be
rather
glad
to
pass
quickly
over
the
hard
problem
he
guessed
in
fact
that
his
communication
would
cause
his
sister
great
consternation
and
he
had
guessed
rightly
in
her
fright
over
his
first
words
she
had
not
even
heard
the
last
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
she
began
to
complain
i
can
see
quite
clearly
what
will
happen
without
unduly
imagining
anything
the
low
nature
and
character
of
the
two
boys
rouses
bruno
ire
and
he
constantly
flies
into
a
rage
when
he
is
with
them
it
is
my
greatest
sorrow
that
he
ca
control
himself
what
on
earth
will
happen
if
the
three
are
compelled
to
be
together
daily
nay
constantly
and
will
even
live
together
the
matter
frightens
me
more
than
you
can
realize
philip
and
now
you
have
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
change
the
plan
but
maxa
ca
you
see
that
i
could
not
act
otherwise
knippel
was
terribly
anxious
to
arrange
it
all
and
you
know
how
quickly
he
is
offended
he
always
imagines
that
his
low
birth
is
in
his
way
for
he
can
not
understand
our
utter
indifference
to
all
the
money
he
has
heaped
up
you
must
not
be
so
anxious
about
it
it
ca
possibly
last
very
long
the
brother
consoled
her
there
is
sure
to
be
a
violent
quarrel
between
them
soon
and
as
soon
as
that
happens
i
promise
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
that
will
give
us
good
grounds
to
separate
them
the
prospect
of
a
horrible
fight
was
however
no
consolation
to
maxa
but
she
said
nothing
more
for
the
matter
was
irrevocably
settled
i
have
to
tell
you
something
now
which
will
put
you
into
a
happier
mood
he
began
clearly
relieved
that
his
unpleasant
communication
had
been
made
yesterday
evening
the
two
ladies
from
hanover
who
were
my
travelling
companions
some
time
ago
came
to
me
to
ask
my
advice
about
something
which
troubled
them
very
much
they
have
received
an
urgent
call
to
return
home
to
their
aged
mother
who
has
fallen
very
ill
and
has
asked
to
see
them
the
little
girl
who
is
in
their
care
however
has
been
so
sick
for
a
few
days
that
they
had
to
call
the
doctor
they
summoned
him
again
yesterday
in
order
to
consult
him
as
to
whether
there
might
be
danger
if
the
child
travelled
he
told
them
positively
that
they
could
not
think
of
letting
her
go
now
and
that
she
might
not
be
able
to
go
for
weeks
a
slow
fever
showed
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
serious
illness
which
would
not
quickly
pass
the
ladies
were
extremely
frightened
and
told
the
doctor
their
dilemma
for
they
were
both
absolutely
compelled
to
leave
one
of
them
might
be
able
to
return
in
about
two
weeks
but
they
had
to
find
a
reliable
person
in
the
meantime
who
could
nurse
the
child
this
was
terribly
difficult
for
them
as
strangers
the
doctor
advice
was
to
bring
the
young
invalid
to
the
hospital
in
sils
where
she
would
be
well
taken
care
of
and
he
could
see
her
every
day
the
ladies
wanted
my
opinion
before
deciding
they
realize
that
doctors
always
favor
hospitals
because
the
care
of
their
patients
is
made
simple
and
easy
so
they
wondered
if
i
advised
them
to
have
the
young
girl
sent
there
i
told
them
that
the
place
was
not
at
all
badly
equipped
but
that
it
was
rather
small
and
the
patients
were
of
course
very
mixed
when
i
asked
the
ladies
if
it
would
not
be
better
if
the
child
parents
decided
that
difficult
question
i
received
the
information
that
leonore
von
wallerstätten
was
an
orphan
and
that
the
aunt
who
had
put
her
in
their
care
had
also
died
oh
philip
now
there
is
no
doubt
any
more
that
she
is
our
little
daughter
maxa
cried
in
the
greatest
agitation
oh
philip
how
could
you
ever
advise
them
to
send
her
to
the
hospital
why
did
you
say
right
away
that
your
sister
would
immediately
take
the
child
into
her
house
how
could
i
do
that
just
think
a
moment
maxa
said
the
brother
did
you
want
me
to
add
to
your
troubles
and
anxieties
by
bringing
a
patient
sick
with
fever
into
your
house
it
might
turn
out
to
be
a
dangerous
illness
which
all
your
five
might
catch
what
should
you
have
said
to
me
then
philip
i
shall
go
to
sils
with
you
and
i
ask
you
to
take
me
to
the
ladies
i
want
them
to
know
who
i
am
of
course
i
shall
tell
them
that
i
have
the
right
as
her
mother
nearest
friend
to
receive
leonore
into
my
house
and
to
nurse
her
i
am
sure
that
the
little
patient
can
take
the
trip
in
your
closed
carriage
you
can
quickly
go
to
the
doctor
to
tell
him
of
our
plan
and
have
the
carriage
sent
to
us
please
do
this
for
me
philip
i
ca
stand
that
the
child
of
our
leonore
should
go
to
a
strange
hospital
all
by
herself
maxa
had
spoken
with
such
decision
that
her
brother
had
listened
to
her
in
greatest
surprise
so
you
have
resolved
to
carry
this
through
maxa
are
you
sure
that
you
wo
have
to
take
it
all
back
after
your
excitement
has
vanished
he
asked
her
you
can
rely
on
me
philip
i
have
absolutely
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
the
sister
assured
him
you
must
help
me
now
to
put
it
through
i
shall
be
able
to
take
care
of
things
when
she
gets
here
but
do
all
in
your
power
to
prevent
the
ladies
from
putting
obstacles
in
my
path
you
see
i
do
not
even
know
them
i
shall
do
whatever
you
wish
the
listener
said
willingly
it
certainly
is
hard
to
tell
where
a
woman
will
set
up
complaints
and
where
she
will
suddenly
not
know
either
fear
or
obstacles
i
have
already
told
the
two
miss
remkes
about
you
as
soon
as
i
knew
the
child
name
i
realized
the
situation
i
told
the
ladies
about
your
being
the
best
friend
of
their
charge
mother
and
that
you
would
surely
go
to
see
her
now
and
then
in
the
hospital
this
pleased
them
greatly
uncle
philip
began
now
to
lay
minute
plans
for
the
morrow
his
sister
had
to
give
her
promise
to
be
ready
very
early
in
order
to
reach
sils
in
good
time
for
the
patient
was
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
he
also
gave
her
all
the
needed
instructions
relating
to
the
coachman
and
the
carriage
she
listened
quietly
till
he
had
finished
and
then
said
i
have
some
news
for
you
too
just
think
baron
bruno
has
come
back
he
arrived
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
nobody
could
see
him
he
is
absolutely
alone
now
in
the
desolate
castle
just
imagine
how
he
must
feel
to
be
within
those
walls
again
where
he
spent
his
happy
years
with
all
those
loved
ones
he
has
not
seen
since
he
left
the
castle
in
a
fit
of
terror
yes
and
why
did
it
happen
was
it
his
own
will
the
brother
said
harshly
whenever
you
speak
about
him
your
voice
takes
on
a
tone
as
if
you
were
speaking
about
a
misunderstood
angel
why
did
the
raging
lion
come
back
all
of
a
sudden
please
philip
do
be
so
hard
his
sister
said
he
is
entirely
left
alone
now
is
sorrow
easier
to
bear
when
it
is
our
own
doing
i
heard
that
he
was
that
is
probably
the
reason
why
he
has
come
home
i
know
all
this
from
apollonie
who
is
in
communication
with
trius
she
keeps
on
scheming
to
find
a
way
to
set
the
rooms
in
order
for
her
young
master
as
she
still
calls
him
she
knows
how
his
mother
would
wish
everything
to
be
for
her
son
i
understand
quite
well
that
she
worries
night
and
day
about
the
state
things
are
in
at
the
castle
her
former
master
has
for
nurse
servant
cook
and
valet
only
that
peculiar
and
ancient
trius
she
can
hardly
think
about
it
without
wishing
that
she
might
do
something
for
her
old
friend
the
poor
woman
is
so
anxious
to
make
his
life
at
the
castle
a
little
more
the
way
it
used
to
be
in
the
old
times
for
heaven
sake
maxa
i
hope
you
are
not
trying
to
interfere
do
you
intend
to
undertake
that
too
the
brother
exclaimed
in
perturbation
if
he
wanted
things
different
he
certainly
would
find
a
way
please
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
otherwise
you
be
sorry
you
can
be
perfectly
reassured
for
unfortunately
nothing
whatever
can
be
done
maxa
replied
if
i
had
known
a
way
to
do
something
for
him
i
should
have
done
it
my
great
wish
is
to
let
a
little
sunshine
into
the
closed
up
sombre
rooms
and
may
be
even
a
little
deeper
i
had
great
hopes
of
doing
something
through
apollonie
who
knows
so
much
about
the
castle
but
she
has
explained
the
state
of
affairs
to
me
she
was
going
to
enter
and
take
things
in
hand
as
soon
as
she
heard
from
trius
that
her
master
had
returned
for
she
still
considers
herself
his
servant
as
in
times
gone
by
it
was
her
intention
naturally
to
put
everything
into
the
usual
order
in
the
house
but
trius
wo
even
let
her
go
into
the
garden
he
let
her
know
that
he
had
received
orders
not
to
let
anyone
into
the
place
his
master
knew
no
one
here
and
had
no
intention
of
meeting
anyone
i
know
quite
well
therefore
that
i
shall
he
unable
to
gratify
my
great
desire
of
doing
something
for
that
miserable
lonely
man
so
much
the
better
the
brother
said
quite
relieved
i
am
glad
that
the
villain
has
bolted
you
out
himself
if
i
should
have
tried
to
keep
you
out
you
certainly
would
have
found
means
to
resist
me
i
know
i
willingly
admit
it
maxa
replied
with
a
smile
but
philip
i
should
consider
it
wise
for
us
to
go
to
bed
now
if
we
have
to
make
an
early
start
to
sils
brother
and
sister
separated
but
maxa
had
many
arrangements
to
make
before
she
came
to
rest
if
the
ladies
would
consent
to
put
the
little
girl
in
her
charge
she
meant
to
bring
her
immediately
home
with
her
therefore
everything
had
to
be
made
ready
for
the
little
patient
about
midnight
maxa
still
went
to
and
fro
in
a
bedroom
on
the
top
floor
which
was
entirely
isolated
when
everything
necessary
had
been
made
ready
she
tried
to
place
various
embellishments
in
the
little
chamber
finally
she
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
a
round
bowl
which
was
to
be
filled
with
the
most
beautiful
roses
from
her
garden
maxa
wanted
the
child
of
her
adored
leonore
to
receive
a
pleasant
impression
from
her
room
in
the
strange
new
house
when
the
morning
sun
would
shine
in
through
the
open
windows
and
the
green
slope
of
the
castle
would
send
its
greeting
to
her
she
did
not
want
little
leonore
to
feel
dissatisfied
with
her
new
quarters
with
this
thought
maxa
happily
closed
the
door
of
the
room
behind
her
and
sought
out
her
own
chamber
chapter
vi
new
friends
early
next
morning
brother
and
sister
started
towards
the
valley
before
going
maxa
had
given
her
orders
and
had
arranged
for
mäzli
to
spend
the
day
with
apollonie
in
order
to
prevent
her
from
getting
into
mischief
as
it
was
a
sunshiny
morning
and
the
paths
were
dry
walking
was
delightful
the
distance
they
had
to
traverse
occupied
about
two
hours
but
it
did
not
seem
long
as
soon
as
brother
and
sister
arrived
in
sils
they
went
to
see
the
two
misses
remke
both
ladies
were
kneeling
before
a
large
trunk
surrounded
by
heaps
of
clothes
shoes
books
and
boxes
and
a
hundred
trifles
besides
when
the
visitors
arrived
they
immediately
stood
before
the
open
door
of
the
room
used
for
packing
maxa
first
impulse
was
to
withdraw
with
an
excuse
but
the
ladies
had
jumped
up
already
and
most
cordially
greeted
their
kind
friend
mr
falcon
whom
they
called
their
helper
and
saviour
in
all
difficulties
they
received
his
sister
joyfully
too
for
they
had
been
most
eager
to
know
her
both
ladies
regretted
that
their
meeting
had
to
take
place
in
a
moment
when
their
house
appeared
in
its
most
unfavorable
light
maxa
assured
them
however
that
she
understood
the
preparations
for
their
impending
trip
and
said
that
she
would
not
disturb
them
longer
than
was
necessary
she
intended
therefore
to
voice
her
request
immediately
falcon
steering
straight
for
some
chairs
he
had
discovered
brought
them
for
the
ladies
despite
all
the
assorted
objects
on
the
floor
maxa
spoke
of
her
intention
of
taking
the
child
to
her
house
and
her
sincere
hope
that
there
would
be
no
objection
and
the
ladies
could
feel
their
visitor
great
eagerness
manifested
in
her
words
they
on
their
part
did
not
hide
the
great
relief
which
this
prospect
gave
them
and
were
extremely
glad
to
leave
their
young
charge
in
such
good
hands
it
has
been
very
hard
for
us
to
decide
to
leave
leonore
behind
one
of
them
said
unfortunately
we
must
go
and
she
is
not
able
to
travel
but
as
long
as
our
plans
seem
to
coincide
so
well
i
shall
ask
you
if
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
you
if
we
put
off
the
date
of
our
return
a
week
longer
you
must
realize
that
we
are
taking
the
journey
for
the
sake
of
our
sick
mother
and
that
everything
is
uncertain
in
such
a
case
one
can
never
tell
what
change
may
come
and
we
might
wish
to
stay
a
little
longer
maxa
hastened
to
assure
them
that
nothing
could
suit
her
better
than
to
keep
leonore
in
her
house
for
several
weeks
and
she
promised
to
send
frequent
news
about
the
little
girl
state
of
health
she
begged
them
not
to
be
anxious
about
her
and
not
to
hurry
back
for
sake
as
she
was
longing
to
see
the
child
instead
of
remaining
in
their
way
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
greet
leonore
she
was
sure
that
her
brother
who
had
already
risen
also
wanted
to
take
his
leave
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
how
completely
the
ladies
entered
into
his
sister
plans
he
wished
to
arrange
the
details
and
so
said
that
he
was
now
going
to
the
doctor
in
order
to
get
his
permission
for
the
little
trip
after
obtaining
this
as
he
sincerely
hoped
to
do
he
would
prepare
the
carriage
and
send
it
directly
to
the
house
as
it
was
important
for
the
patient
to
make
the
journey
during
the
best
portion
of
the
day
thereupon
he
hastened
off
one
of
the
ladies
took
maxa
to
the
sick
room
which
was
situated
in
the
uppermost
story
you
wo
find
leonore
alone
she
said
her
brother
is
with
her
he
is
taking
a
trip
through
switzerland
with
his
teacher
and
some
friends
and
came
here
ahead
of
them
in
order
to
see
his
sister
his
travelling
companions
will
join
him
here
and
then
they
are
all
going
back
to
germany
i
fear
that
the
poor
boy
will
lose
his
day
with
his
sister
if
i
take
her
with
me
maxa
said
regretfully
well
that
ca
be
altered
the
lady
quickly
replied
we
are
all
only
too
happy
that
you
are
willing
to
take
leonore
into
your
house
who
knows
how
her
stay
in
the
hospital
might
have
turned
out
poor
leonore
was
so
frightened
by
the
thought
but
we
knew
no
other
way
it
does
not
matter
about
her
brother
visit
because
they
can
see
each
other
again
in
hanover
for
he
is
at
a
boarding
school
there
the
lady
now
opened
a
door
and
led
maxa
into
a
room
leonore
look
here
is
bergmann
a
great
friend
of
your
mother
miss
remke
said
and
i
am
sure
you
will
be
glad
of
the
news
she
is
bringing
you
i
shall
accept
your
kind
permission
to
get
back
to
my
work
now
bergmann
everything
is
ready
for
leonore
because
she
was
to
leave
for
the
hospital
very
shortly
with
these
words
she
went
out
the
sick
child
sat
completely
dressed
on
a
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
half
reclining
on
the
pillows
maxa
had
to
agree
with
her
brother
who
had
said
that
she
had
her
mother
large
speaking
eyes
the
same
soft
brown
curls
and
the
same
serious
expression
on
her
delicately
shaped
little
face
maxa
would
have
easily
recognized
the
child
even
without
knowing
her
name
leonore
only
looked
more
serious
still
in
fact
her
glance
was
extremely
sad
and
at
that
moment
tears
were
hanging
on
her
lashes
for
she
had
been
crying
the
boy
sitting
by
her
got
up
and
made
a
bow
to
the
new
arrival
he
had
his
father
gay
blue
eyes
and
his
clear
open
brow
after
giving
him
her
hand
maxa
stepped
up
to
the
bed
to
greet
leonore
and
was
so
deeply
moved
that
she
could
barely
speak
my
dear
child
she
said
seizing
both
slender
hands
you
resemble
your
mother
so
much
that
i
have
to
greet
you
as
my
own
beloved
child
i
loved
her
very
much
and
we
meant
a
great
deal
to
each
other
you
remind
me
of
both
your
father
and
mother
salo
what
happiness
my
friendship
with
your
parents
has
brought
me
i
want
you
both
to
be
my
children
now
for
your
parents
were
the
best
friends
i
ever
had
in
the
world
this
speech
apparently
met
a
response
in
the
two
children
hearts
as
answer
leonore
took
maxa
hand
and
held
it
tight
between
her
own
and
salo
came
close
to
her
to
show
what
confidence
he
felt
then
he
said
joyfully
oh
i
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come
you
must
help
me
comfort
leonore
she
is
terribly
afraid
of
the
hospital
and
all
the
strange
people
there
she
even
imagines
that
she
will
die
there
alone
and
forsaken
and
was
crying
because
she
thinks
that
we
wo
see
each
other
again
i
have
to
go
so
far
away
and
i
ca
help
it
they
are
coming
to
fetch
me
and
then
i
have
to
go
back
to
school
what
shall
we
do
as
to
that
maxa
replied
nothing
can
be
done
but
if
leonore
has
to
spend
a
little
while
in
the
hospital
she
wo
be
an
absolute
stranger
there
i
wo
let
you
be
lonely
for
i
shall
often
go
to
see
you
dear
child
and
it
is
not
even
quite
certain
that
you
have
to
go
there
oh
yes
they
are
going
to
take
me
there
this
morning
maybe
quite
soon
said
leonore
listening
anxiously
she
again
grasped
hand
as
if
it
were
her
safety
anchor
maxa
did
not
gainsay
her
because
she
did
not
yet
know
what
the
doctor
might
decide
all
she
could
do
to
calm
leonore
was
to
tell
her
that
she
was
not
dangerously
she
might
recover
very
quickly
if
she
only
stayed
quiet
for
a
while
in
that
case
she
could
soon
see
her
brother
again
for
the
ladies
had
promised
to
take
her
home
as
soon
as
she
was
well
maxa
had
hardly
said
that
when
leonore
eyes
again
began
to
fill
with
tears
but
i
do
feel
at
home
there
we
really
have
no
home
anywhere
she
said
with
suppressed
sobs
yes
it
is
true
we
have
no
home
anywhere
salo
exclaimed
passionately
but
leonore
you
must
have
faith
in
me
fighting
against
his
rising
agitation
he
quickly
wiped
away
a
tear
from
his
eyes
which
were
usually
so
bright
it
wo
be
so
long
till
i
have
finished
my
studies
and
then
i
can
do
what
i
please
then
i
shall
try
to
find
a
little
house
for
us
both
which
will
be
our
home
i
am
going
to
get
that
if
i
have
to
work
for
twenty
years
in
the
fields
till
it
is
paid
for
salo
eyes
had
become
sunny
again
during
this
speech
he
looked
as
if
he
would
not
have
minded
seizing
a
hoe
that
very
moment
rapid
steps
were
now
heard
approaching
the
door
was
quickly
opened
and
miss
remke
called
out
on
entering
the
carriage
is
at
the
door
let
us
get
ready
for
i
do
not
want
the
gentleman
to
wait
i
am
sure
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
help
me
lift
leonore
out
of
bed
and
to
carry
her
down
stairs
leonore
had
grown
as
white
as
a
sheet
from
fright
may
i
ask
if
it
is
my
brother
carriage
or
maxa
hesitated
a
little
yes
certainly
the
lady
interrupted
while
she
rapidly
pulled
some
covers
and
shawls
out
of
a
wardrobe
your
brother
has
come
himself
in
order
to
see
that
the
carriage
is
well
protected
he
also
means
to
give
the
coachman
the
directions
himself
but
we
must
not
keep
him
waiting
what
a
kind
friend
he
is
maxa
had
already
lifted
leonore
from
her
bed
and
was
carrying
her
out
please
bring
all
the
necessary
things
downstairs
i
can
do
this
easily
alone
for
she
is
as
light
as
a
feather
she
called
back
to
the
lady
who
had
hastened
after
her
in
order
to
help
going
downstairs
mrs
maxa
said
leonore
i
am
going
to
take
you
home
with
me
now
the
doctor
is
letting
me
do
what
i
wished
you
will
stay
with
me
till
you
are
well
again
and
i
shall
take
care
of
you
shall
you
like
to
come
with
me
we
know
each
other
a
little
already
and
i
hope
you
wo
feel
so
strange
with
us
leonore
flinging
both
arms
about
maxa
neck
held
her
so
tight
that
she
could
feel
the
little
girl
considered
her
no
stranger
any
longer
suddenly
leonore
called
back
in
jubilating
tones
salo
salo
did
you
hear
salo
had
heard
her
call
but
comprehended
nothing
further
miss
remke
had
piled
such
heaps
of
shawls
and
covers
on
his
arms
that
one
always
slid
down
after
the
other
and
he
was
obliged
to
pick
them
up
again
as
quickly
as
the
circumstances
allowed
he
ran
after
his
sister
arrived
at
the
carriage
maxa
immediately
looked
about
for
her
brother
she
wanted
to
hand
leonore
to
him
while
she
prepared
everything
in
the
conveyance
for
the
child
comfort
he
was
already
there
understanding
his
sister
sign
he
took
the
child
into
his
arms
then
lifted
her
gently
into
the
carriage
his
glance
was
suddenly
arrested
by
the
boy
who
was
standing
beside
the
carriage
with
his
burdens
with
the
most
joyful
surprise
he
exclaimed
as
sure
as
i
am
born
this
must
be
a
young
salo
it
is
written
in
his
eyes
give
me
your
hand
boy
your
father
was
my
friend
my
best
friend
in
the
world
so
we
must
be
friends
too
salo
eyes
expressed
more
and
more
surprise
this
manner
of
being
taken
to
a
hospital
seemed
very
odd
to
him
the
strangest
of
all
however
was
that
leonore
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
smiling
contentedly
for
maxa
had
just
whispered
something
into
her
ear
do
we
have
to
say
now
leonore
salo
asked
jumping
up
the
carriage
step
and
ca
i
see
you
any
more
salo
maxa
said
i
was
just
thinking
that
you
could
sit
beside
the
coachman
if
you
want
to
you
can
drive
to
nolla
with
us
for
you
will
want
to
see
where
leonore
is
going
i
can
have
you
brought
back
in
time
to
meet
your
friends
do
you
approve
of
that
philip
certainly
certainly
the
brother
answered
but
if
that
is
the
plan
i
am
going
along
i
thought
at
first
that
this
trip
would
prove
a
very
mournful
one
it
seems
more
like
a
to
me
now
so
come
too
salo
and
i
will
sit
high
up
and
i
promise
to
bring
him
back
here
with
shining
eyes
the
boy
climbed
to
the
seat
which
the
coachman
had
just
relinquished
he
understood
now
that
the
hospital
was
not
to
be
their
destination
with
many
hearty
handshakes
and
good
wishes
the
two
remke
ladies
at
last
let
their
friend
and
adviser
go
after
many
more
last
greetings
to
all
the
party
the
carriage
finally
rolled
towards
the
valley
leonore
was
so
exhausted
that
leaning
against
her
companion
she
fell
asleep
but
she
staunchly
held
on
to
maxa
hand
which
seemed
to
her
that
of
a
loving
mother
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
felt
this
on
the
high
seat
outside
the
conversation
was
extremely
lively
young
salo
had
to
tell
where
and
how
he
lived
and
then
his
companion
explained
in
turn
the
places
they
were
passing
through
and
told
him
whatever
unusual
had
happened
in
the
neighborhood
the
uncle
found
out
that
neither
salo
nor
his
sister
had
the
slightest
remembrance
of
their
parents
the
boy
earliest
memory
went
back
to
an
estate
in
holstein
where
they
had
lived
with
an
elderly
his
sister
they
were
about
five
or
six
years
old
when
the
aunt
died
after
which
they
were
sent
to
hanover
to
their
present
abode
twice
a
year
a
relation
of
their
came
to
see
them
but
he
was
such
a
stiff
quiet
gentleman
that
they
could
not
enjoy
his
visits
it
was
however
this
man
who
always
decided
what
was
to
be
done
with
them
for
the
present
they
were
to
remain
where
they
were
till
salo
had
finished
his
studies
after
that
the
choice
where
to
settle
was
left
to
them
but
i
know
what
i
shall
do
first
of
all
salo
added
with
sparkling
eyes
just
then
the
old
castle
came
in
view
oh
what
a
wonderful
castle
with
great
towers
salo
exclaimed
it
is
all
closed
up
there
ca
be
anybody
living
there
it
does
seem
to
be
in
ruins
though
what
is
it
called
this
is
castle
wildenstein
the
boy
companion
curtly
answered
throwing
a
searching
glance
at
the
young
baron
the
latter
looked
innocently
up
at
the
gray
towers
remarking
that
anybody
who
owned
a
castle
like
that
would
simply
be
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
he
knows
nothing
about
the
castle
of
his
ancestors
and
the
whole
tragic
story
so
much
the
better
said
uncle
philip
to
himself
when
the
carriage
drove
up
before
maxa
door
everything
was
very
quiet
there
for
the
children
were
still
in
school
kathy
came
running
towards
them
with
astonished
eyes
she
did
not
know
at
all
what
was
going
on
and
that
was
a
novelty
for
her
salo
had
the
reins
pressed
into
his
hands
before
he
knew
it
with
a
bound
his
new
friend
had
jumped
to
the
ground
and
called
back
if
you
do
move
the
horses
will
stay
quiet
too
quickly
opening
the
carriage
he
lifted
leonore
out
and
carried
her
up
to
the
little
room
which
had
been
got
ready
for
her
maxa
followed
at
his
heels
he
then
turned
hurriedly
back
to
his
young
substitute
for
he
felt
a
little
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
what
might
happen
to
the
horses
and
carriage
the
boy
might
want
to
drive
about
and
the
horses
might
begin
to
jump
but
no
stiff
and
immovable
the
boy
sat
at
his
post
firmly
holding
the
reins
even
now
when
a
party
of
eight
feet
came
running
towards
him
salo
did
not
move
the
calls
of
uncle
philip
uncle
philip
sounded
with
more
vigor
than
usual
because
the
children
had
not
expected
him
back
so
soon
and
therefore
had
to
celebrate
his
coming
with
double
energy
uncle
philip
was
immediately
surrounded
and
eight
arms
held
him
so
tight
that
there
was
no
use
in
struggling
just
look
at
my
young
nobleman
up
there
he
said
vainly
trying
to
get
free
he
certainly
knows
what
it
means
to
remain
firmly
at
his
post
and
do
his
duty
if
he
had
not
held
the
reins
tightly
your
wild
cries
would
have
driven
horses
and
carriage
down
the
ravine
long
ago
all
arms
suddenly
dropped
and
all
eyes
were
directed
towards
the
figure
on
the
coachman
seat
in
the
unexpected
joy
of
their
uncle
return
nobody
had
noticed
the
boy
uncle
philip
who
was
free
now
let
salo
get
down
and
introduced
him
to
the
children
salo
had
a
friendly
greeting
for
every
one
and
his
eyes
sparkled
gaily
when
he
shook
their
hands
his
whole
appearance
was
so
attractive
and
engaging
that
the
children
immediately
took
a
liking
to
him
with
lively
gestures
they
surrounded
him
like
an
old
acquaintance
so
that
salo
quickly
felt
that
he
had
come
among
good
friends
even
the
reserved
bruno
whom
nobody
had
ever
been
able
to
approach
linked
salo
arm
confidentially
in
his
in
order
to
conduct
the
guest
into
the
house
here
bruno
sat
down
beside
salo
and
the
two
were
immediately
immersed
in
the
most
eager
conversation
mea
kurt
and
lippo
were
hunting
everywhere
for
their
mother
for
they
had
not
the
faintest
idea
where
she
had
gone
when
uncle
philip
came
back
he
called
them
together
and
told
them
where
their
mother
was
and
what
she
wished
them
to
know
through
him
as
she
had
brought
a
sick
child
with
her
she
could
have
no
intercourse
with
the
children
for
two
or
three
days
the
doctor
had
also
forbidden
them
to
go
up
to
the
and
they
were
to
do
the
best
they
could
during
that
time
if
the
sickness
should
get
worse
a
nurse
was
to
come
to
the
house
and
then
the
mother
would
be
free
again
if
the
illness
was
to
be
slight
on
the
contrary
the
children
would
be
admitted
to
the
and
make
leonore
acquaintance
they
could
even
help
a
little
in
her
care
for
the
mother
would
not
then
be
obliged
to
keep
them
apart
mäzli
was
to
be
sent
to
apollonie
every
morning
and
was
to
spend
the
day
there
not
to
be
able
to
have
a
glimpse
of
their
mother
for
two
or
three
days
was
depressing
news
indeed
the
three
children
faces
were
absolutely
disconcerted
for
the
obstacles
were
clearly
insurmountable
well
is
this
so
terrible
uncle
philip
said
cheerily
who
needs
to
let
his
wings
droop
just
think
if
you
were
in
the
place
of
the
sick
girl
who
has
no
mother
at
all
ca
you
let
her
have
yours
for
a
few
days
no
just
think
what
is
to
follow
your
mother
will
come
down
then
and
bring
you
a
new
playmate
leonore
is
friendly
and
charming
and
has
sweeter
manners
than
you
have
ever
seen
kurt
is
sure
to
make
dozens
of
songs
about
her
and
mea
will
be
carried
away
with
enthusiasm
for
her
lippo
will
find
an
affectionate
protectress
in
her
who
will
be
able
to
appreciate
his
virtues
are
you
satisfied
now
this
speech
really
had
splendid
results
all
three
were
willing
enough
now
to
let
the
sick
leonore
have
their
mother
and
they
were
anxious
besides
to
do
everything
in
their
power
to
make
leonore
recovery
speedy
the
uncle
description
of
the
new
playmate
had
wakened
such
a
lively
sympathy
in
them
that
they
were
ready
to
assist
him
in
many
ways
and
he
was
even
obliged
to
cool
their
zeal
as
their
guest
was
to
remain
such
a
short
while
uncle
philip
suggested
a
walk
in
order
to
show
him
the
surroundings
but
when
they
looked
around
for
salo
they
could
not
find
either
him
or
bruno
they
thought
of
the
same
thing
uncle
philip
said
it
will
be
great
fun
to
hunt
for
them
so
they
started
off
uncle
philip
had
guessed
right
bruno
had
found
his
new
friend
so
much
to
his
liking
that
he
wanted
to
keep
him
entirely
to
himself
while
the
uncle
had
talked
with
the
younger
children
he
had
led
salo
out
to
take
him
on
a
stroll
in
the
beautiful
sunset
salo
was
perfectly
satisfied
too
as
he
felt
himself
likewise
drawn
towards
bruno
in
this
short
time
the
two
boys
had
grown
as
confiding
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
for
years
and
they
were
just
then
wandering
towards
the
castle
hill
absorbed
in
lively
conversation
can
you
guess
why
i
am
taking
you
up
there
bruno
suddenly
asked
interrupting
the
talk
because
it
is
so
lovely
salo
replied
quickly
he
had
stopped
walking
and
was
looking
across
the
flowering
meadows
towards
the
castle
over
which
rosy
clouds
were
floating
on
the
bright
evening
sky
no
not
for
that
reason
said
bruno
but
because
it
belongs
to
an
uncle
of
yours
salo
looked
at
him
full
of
astonishment
but
bruno
what
an
idea
he
called
out
laughing
that
would
not
be
so
bad
but
it
ca
be
true
we
only
have
one
uncle
who
has
been
living
in
spain
for
a
number
of
years
and
who
expects
to
stay
there
the
castle
belongs
to
just
that
uncle
who
lives
in
spain
bruno
asserted
he
reminded
salo
of
the
fact
that
their
mothers
had
known
each
other
while
living
in
the
castle
and
had
grown
to
be
such
friends
there
salo
admitted
this
but
was
firmly
persuaded
that
the
castle
had
long
since
been
sold
and
that
his
uncle
would
never
come
back
he
had
heard
that
from
his
so
bruno
had
to
agree
with
him
that
the
castle
had
probably
been
sold
if
the
uncle
did
not
think
of
returning
do
you
know
salo
said
bruno
while
they
continued
their
walk
i
should
love
to
do
what
your
uncle
did
i
want
to
go
away
from
here
and
disappear
for
a
long
time
then
i
would
not
be
obliged
to
be
fettered
to
those
two
horrid
boys
i
ca
stand
it
and
you
now
know
yourself
what
they
are
like
bruno
had
described
his
two
comrades
to
his
new
friend
their
mean
attitude
and
their
frequent
and
contemptible
tricks
salo
had
repeatedly
shown
his
feeling
by
sudden
exclamations
and
he
said
now
with
comforting
sympathy
i
am
sure
it
must
make
you
feel
like
running
away
if
you
are
obliged
to
spend
all
your
days
with
two
such
boys
but
do
listen
to
them
pay
no
attention
to
them
and
let
them
do
and
say
what
they
please
if
they
want
to
be
mean
let
them
be
for
they
ca
make
you
different
oh
if
you
could
be
with
me
that
would
be
much
easier
bruno
said
i
should
know
then
that
you
felt
with
me
and
shared
my
anger
when
i
am
compelled
to
be
alone
with
them
and
they
do
sneaky
acts
to
people
who
ca
defend
themselves
i
always
get
so
mad
that
i
have
to
beat
them
that
always
brings
nasty
talk
and
makes
my
mother
unhappy
and
then
i
feel
worse
than
ever
if
only
i
could
go
far
away
and
never
have
to
meet
them
any
more
if
you
had
an
idea
what
it
is
like
not
to
have
any
home
at
all
you
would
not
wish
to
leave
yours
without
even
knowing
where
to
go
said
salo
you
would
not
think
that
anything
was
too
hard
to
bear
if
you
could
go
home
and
tell
your
mother
all
about
it
if
you
have
that
consolation
it
should
make
you
able
to
stand
a
lot
of
trouble
i
should
mind
living
with
those
two
during
school
term
if
i
could
go
to
a
place
during
the
holidays
that
were
a
real
home
for
me
and
leonore
every
time
i
come
to
her
she
cries
about
having
no
home
in
the
whole
wide
world
i
try
to
think
out
something
so
that
we
wo
have
to
wait
so
long
before
we
can
live
together
but
that
is
hard
to
carry
out
for
the
gentleman
in
holstein
who
decides
about
our
upbringing
wants
me
to
study
for
many
years
that
will
take
much
too
long
leonore
might
even
die
before
that
and
i
want
to
do
it
all
for
her
i
am
so
glad
now
that
leonore
has
fallen
ill
and
has
therefore
come
to
you
he
said
with
a
brighter
glance
i
wish
she
would
stay
sick
for
a
while
of
course
not
awfully
sick
he
corrected
himself
rapidly
i
mean
just
sick
enough
so
that
your
mother
would
not
let
her
go
i
know
quite
well
how
happy
leonore
will
be
with
her
she
was
so
kind
and
friendly
with
us
right
away
since
our
old
aunt
died
nobody
has
been
so
good
and
sweet
with
us
as
your
mother
and
that
will
do
more
good
to
leonore
than
anything
else
on
earth
salo
words
made
a
deep
impression
on
bruno
he
had
never
before
realized
that
everyone
did
not
have
a
lovely
home
like
his
and
a
mother
besides
who
was
always
ready
to
greet
him
affectionately
who
could
be
told
everything
could
help
him
bear
everything
who
shared
all
his
experiences
and
had
a
sympathy
like
no
one
else
all
this
he
had
accepted
as
if
it
could
not
be
otherwise
now
came
the
realization
that
things
might
be
different
poor
salo
and
his
sister
for
instance
had
to
suffer
bitterly
from
missing
what
he
had
always
enjoyed
to
the
full
without
thinking
about
it
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
sympathy
for
his
new
friend
who
looked
so
refined
and
charming
and
who
already
had
to
bear
such
sorrow
for
himself
and
his
sister
bruno
now
flung
behind
him
all
the
thoughts
and
schemes
he
had
had
in
connection
with
his
coming
fate
and
with
all
the
fire
of
his
nature
he
fastened
on
the
thought
of
doing
everything
in
his
power
to
help
salo
he
wanted
to
further
his
friend
plan
to
found
a
home
for
himself
and
his
sister
as
soon
as
possible
that
was
something
much
more
important
than
his
disinclination
to
dc
with
the
knippel
boys
now
i
shall
not
think
about
anything
but
what
you
can
do
to
make
your
plan
come
true
he
said
at
the
conclusion
of
his
meditation
if
there
are
two
of
us
who
are
so
set
on
finding
a
way
we
are
sure
to
succeed
somehow
it
seems
so
wonderful
to
me
said
salo
quite
overcome
by
bruno
warm
sympathy
i
have
various
friends
in
boarding
school
but
there
one
to
whom
i
could
have
told
what
i
am
always
thinking
about
as
i
have
told
you
you
are
so
different
from
them
will
you
be
my
friend
bruno
firmly
grasped
salo
proffered
hand
and
cried
out
with
beaming
eyes
yes
salo
i
will
be
your
friend
my
whole
life
long
i
wish
i
could
do
you
a
favor
too
as
you
have
done
me
but
i
have
not
done
anything
for
you
salo
said
with
surprise
oh
yes
you
have
now
that
i
know
i
have
a
friend
i
have
lost
my
dread
of
living
with
the
knippel
boys
i
know
that
i
can
let
them
do
as
they
please
for
i
know
that
i
have
a
friend
who
thinks
as
i
do
and
would
have
the
same
feeling
about
their
actions
i
be
able
to
tell
you
everything
and
you
will
tell
me
what
you
think
i
can
let
them
alone
and
think
of
you
do
you
know
bruno
the
way
i
feel
a
real
friendship
ought
to
be
salo
said
with
glowing
eyes
for
this
had
made
him
happy
too
i
think
it
ought
to
be
this
way
if
we
have
to
hear
of
anything
that
is
ugly
mean
or
rough
we
ought
to
think
right
away
i
have
a
friend
who
would
never
do
such
a
thing
if
we
hear
of
something
though
that
pleases
us
because
it
is
fine
noble
and
great
we
should
think
again
my
friend
would
do
the
same
do
you
agree
with
me
bruno
judged
himself
very
severely
because
his
mother
had
held
up
his
own
faults
to
him
so
that
he
knew
them
very
well
he
replied
hesitatingly
i
wish
one
could
always
be
the
way
one
wants
to
be
would
you
give
up
trusting
a
friend
right
away
if
he
did
not
act
the
way
you
expected
him
to
no
no
salo
said
quickly
such
a
friend
could
not
trust
me
any
more
either
i
mean
it
differently
the
friend
ought
to
hate
to
do
wrong
and
ought
to
want
to
do
right
he
ought
to
be
most
sorry
if
he
did
not
come
up
to
the
best
bruno
could
now
gladly
and
joyfully
assent
suddenly
the
two
boys
heard
their
names
called
out
loudly
turning
round
they
saw
kurt
and
lippo
hurrying
towards
them
and
the
uncle
following
with
mea
at
a
slower
pace
wait
wait
kurt
cried
out
so
loudly
that
the
echo
sounded
back
again
from
the
castle
wait
wait
the
two
friends
were
doing
just
what
had
been
asked
of
them
for
they
were
sitting
quietly
on
the
turf
the
brothers
had
now
reached
them
and
mea
soon
followed
with
the
uncle
whose
face
showed
signs
of
perturbation
i
hope
you
have
not
run
up
to
the
castle
with
salo
bruno
he
cried
out
with
agitation
oh
no
uncle
bruno
replied
we
sat
down
here
on
the
way
up
i
just
wanted
to
show
salo
the
castle
that
belonged
to
his
uncle
but
he
does
not
know
anything
about
it
he
thinks
that
it
has
been
sold
long
ago
because
he
never
heard
about
it
good
said
uncle
philip
with
satisfaction
now
let
us
quickly
go
home
it
is
not
right
to
starve
a
guest
on
his
first
visit
he
might
never
come
again
oh
i
certainly
shall
here
salo
hesitated
i
do
not
remember
the
name
he
added
quite
concerned
my
name
here
is
uncle
philip
the
kind
gentleman
answered
just
uncle
philip
nothing
else
am
i
allowed
to
call
you
uncle
too
that
makes
me
feel
so
much
at
home
salo
exclaimed
after
nodding
cordially
well
uncle
philip
i
mean
to
come
to
you
again
with
the
keenest
pleasure
every
time
i
am
invited
i
would
even
come
with
the
greatest
joy
if
you
never
gave
me
anything
to
eat
no
no
we
do
have
institutions
for
starving
people
uncle
philip
replied
we
are
returning
home
now
to
a
little
feast
i
have
told
kathy
to
get
ready
it
will
consist
mostly
of
country
dishes
our
guest
must
know
he
has
been
received
by
friends
oh
uncle
philip
i
felt
that
the
first
moment
i
met
you
salo
exclaimed
the
little
group
now
strolled
happily
down
the
incline
towards
the
house
mäzli
was
standing
in
the
doorway
with
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
she
had
received
the
news
from
kathy
that
they
were
to
have
omelette
sour
milk
and
sweet
biscuits
for
supper
in
honour
of
a
charming
guest
and
uncle
philip
who
had
come
back
so
mäzli
looked
out
at
them
and
as
soon
as
they
were
near
enough
studied
salo
very
carefully
he
must
have
pleased
her
for
she
quickly
ran
towards
him
and
reaching
out
her
hand
said
wo
you
stay
with
us
for
a
while
salo
laughed
yes
i
should
love
to
taking
him
by
the
hand
mäzli
led
him
into
the
house
and
to
the
room
where
the
inviting
table
was
already
set
kathy
had
been
so
many
years
in
the
house
that
she
knew
exactly
how
things
ought
to
be
everyone
sat
down
now
and
uncle
philip
was
amusingly
talking
everything
he
had
ordered
for
the
meal
tasted
so
delightfully
that
it
seemed
like
a
feast
to
them
and
salo
said
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
conceive
such
a
wonderful
end
of
my
holidays
if
i
had
imagined
the
most
marvellous
thing
in
the
world
if
salo
could
only
stay
here
a
few
days
if
only
day
more
bruno
urged
all
the
rest
were
of
the
same
opinion
and
they
loudly
begged
uncle
philip
to
persuade
him
to
spend
the
next
day
with
them
they
thought
that
even
one
day
together
would
be
perfect
for
everyone
yes
and
for
me
most
of
all
said
salo
but
i
can
not
my
teacher
and
comrades
are
coming
to
fetch
me
at
sils
at
ten
this
is
absolutely
settled
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
chance
for
my
staying
here
even
if
i
wished
it
more
than
anything
in
the
world
that
is
right
salo
that
is
the
way
to
talk
uncle
philip
said
what
has
to
be
has
to
be
even
if
we
do
like
it
please
do
not
beg
him
any
more
to
stay
let
us
play
a
nice
game
now
and
let
us
enjoy
ourselves
while
he
is
with
us
uncle
philip
soon
started
the
game
and
their
merry
mood
returned
with
the
fun
at
the
exact
time
when
their
mother
always
called
the
little
ones
for
bed
lippo
cried
uncle
philip
we
must
sing
the
evening
song
now
and
after
that
mäzli
and
i
must
go
to
bed
this
did
not
suit
mäzli
at
all
however
for
she
was
full
of
the
game
just
then
salo
who
was
sitting
beside
her
had
been
so
funny
that
it
suited
her
better
to
stay
here
than
to
go
to
bed
quickly
climbing
up
the
uncle
chair
from
behind
she
put
both
round
arms
caressingly
about
his
neck
and
whispered
in
his
ear
oh
darling
uncle
philip
is
a
is
it
ca
we
stay
up
a
little
longer
the
game
is
such
fun
and
it
so
tiresome
to
go
to
bed
yes
yes
it
is
a
the
uncle
assented
the
little
ones
can
stay
up
a
little
longer
let
us
all
keep
on
playing
mäzli
joyfully
skipped
back
to
her
place
and
the
merriment
was
resumed
the
game
which
was
very
amusing
was
made
more
so
by
uncle
funny
remarks
nobody
had
noticed
therefore
how
quiet
mäzli
had
grown
salo
suddenly
remarked
oh
look
mäzli
is
sound
asleep
she
is
nearly
tumbling
from
her
chair
and
the
little
girl
would
have
dropped
had
not
salo
held
her
by
quickly
putting
his
arm
about
her
uncle
philip
went
to
her
come
mäzli
come
he
said
encouragingly
open
your
eyes
quickly
and
mea
will
take
you
to
bed
no
no
mäzli
lamented
and
would
not
move
but
you
must
just
look
we
are
all
going
the
uncle
said
vigorously
do
you
want
to
stay
behind
no
no
no
mäzli
moaned
full
of
misery
mea
give
her
some
cake
the
uncle
ordered
then
she
wake
up
we
have
no
cake
uncle
mea
replied
what
you
do
have
a
thing
so
necessary
as
that
in
a
house
full
of
children
well
i
shall
get
some
he
said
quite
agitated
do
you
want
a
candy
mäzli
come
just
taste
how
sweet
it
is
no
no
no
mäzli
moaned
again
in
such
sorrowful
tones
as
no
one
had
ever
heard
from
the
energetic
little
child
suddenly
a
most
disturbing
thought
shot
through
the
uncle
brain
suppose
the
child
has
already
caught
the
fever
what
should
i
do
what
ought
one
to
do
he
cried
out
with
growing
anxiety
kathy
had
entered
the
room
in
the
meantime
to
see
if
anything
more
was
needed
that
is
the
way
falcon
she
said
going
up
to
mäzli
and
quickly
lifting
her
in
her
strong
arms
she
carried
her
upstairs
despite
all
her
lamenting
the
child
was
then
undressed
and
put
to
bed
in
the
shortest
time
she
was
sound
asleep
again
without
a
trace
of
fever
well
that
over
now
uncle
philip
said
quite
relieved
when
kathy
came
back
with
the
news
i
really
think
that
the
time
has
come
for
us
all
to
seek
our
beds
lippo
actually
looks
as
if
he
could
not
stand
on
his
little
legs
the
boy
was
as
white
as
chalk
from
staying
up
so
late
from
time
to
time
he
tried
to
open
his
eyes
but
they
always
fell
shut
again
the
uncle
taking
his
hand
wanted
to
lead
him
away
but
he
fought
against
it
uncle
philip
we
have
not
sung
the
evening
song
yet
he
said
clutching
the
piano
mercy
the
uncle
cried
out
disturbed
is
this
going
to
start
now
no
no
lippo
it
is
much
too
late
you
can
sing
two
songs
then
everything
will
be
straightened
out
then
we
shall
have
sung
two
songs
but
none
lippo
began
in
a
complaining
voice
holding
on
to
the
piano
and
pulling
his
uncle
towards
him
nothing
can
be
done
we
have
to
do
it
uncle
philip
said
with
resignation
for
he
knew
the
obstinacy
of
his
godson
in
regard
to
all
customs
kurt
you
can
tell
me
about
the
songs
please
find
the
shortest
in
the
or
we
shall
have
to
sing
till
morning
please
spare
us
such
a
miserable
scene
but
wait
kurt
the
song
must
have
a
tune
i
can
sing
for
as
nobody
plays
the
piano
i
have
to
set
the
tune
do
you
want
to
sing
with
us
too
salo
or
is
it
too
late
for
you
you
can
retire
if
you
prefer
you
go
upstairs
to
the
room
at
the
right
corner
oh
no
i
want
to
stay
as
long
as
anybody
is
left
salo
replied
i
shall
enjoy
singing
and
doing
everything
with
you
it
is
all
so
funny
and
strange
kurt
had
chosen
a
suitable
song
and
uncle
philip
began
it
so
vigorously
that
everybody
could
join
and
a
chorus
was
formed
voice
sounded
dreadfully
weak
but
he
sang
every
note
to
the
last
word
fighting
mightily
against
his
growing
sleepiness
now
the
little
company
could
wander
upstairs
to
their
respective
rooms
without
further
obstacle
oh
uncle
philip
breathed
relieved
when
they
had
reached
the
top
at
least
we
are
as
far
as
this
it
really
is
an
undertaking
to
keep
in
order
a
handful
of
children
where
one
always
differs
from
the
last
now
i
have
luckily
gotten
through
for
today
what
not
yet
what
is
the
matter
bruno
the
latter
approaching
his
uncle
with
clear
signs
that
he
wanted
him
for
something
had
pulled
him
aside
i
want
to
ask
you
for
something
said
bruno
i
wonder
if
you
will
do
me
a
great
favor
uncle
philip
salo
and
i
have
so
much
to
talk
about
still
and
he
must
leave
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
kurt
can
sleep
beside
you
in
the
guest
room
and
salo
could
sleep
in
kurt
bed
in
my
room
what
are
you
thinking
of
the
uncle
said
irritably
you
should
hear
what
your
mother
would
say
to
that
the
idea
of
having
a
wallerstätten
for
a
guest
and
offering
him
a
bed
which
has
been
used
already
that
would
seem
a
real
crime
in
her
eyes
that
ca
be
no
it
must
i
hope
you
can
see
it
too
do
you
yes
bruno
said
much
depressed
for
he
had
to
agree
but
uncle
could
not
stand
such
downcast
spirits
listen
bruno
he
said
you
realize
that
we
ca
do
it
that
way
but
an
uncle
knows
how
to
arrange
things
and
that
is
why
he
is
here
this
is
the
way
we
do
i
sleep
in
your
bed
and
salo
and
you
can
sleep
in
the
will
that
suit
oh
thank
you
uncle
philip
there
is
no
other
uncle
like
you
bruno
cried
out
in
his
enthusiasm
so
uncle
philip
last
difficulty
was
solved
for
and
everybody
was
willing
to
go
to
bed
soon
the
house
lay
in
deep
quiet
even
the
sick
child
in
the
highest
story
lay
calmly
sleeping
on
her
cool
pillows
she
did
not
even
notice
when
maxa
stepped
up
once
more
to
her
bedside
with
a
little
lamp
before
herself
retiring
she
wanted
to
listen
once
more
to
the
child
breathing
only
the
two
new
friends
were
still
talking
long
after
midnight
they
understood
each
other
so
thoroughly
and
upon
all
points
that
bruno
had
proposed
in
his
enthusiasm
that
they
would
not
waste
one
minute
of
the
night
in
sleep
salo
expressed
his
wish
over
and
over
again
that
bruno
might
become
his
comrade
in
the
boarding
school
but
finally
victorious
sleep
stole
unperceived
over
the
two
lads
and
quietly
closed
their
eyes
chapter
vii
the
mother
absence
has
consequences
next
morning
salo
was
allowed
to
go
into
his
sister
room
in
order
to
say
to
her
she
looked
at
him
so
cheerfully
that
he
asked
with
eager
delight
do
you
feel
so
much
better
already
leonore
oh
yes
i
feel
as
if
i
were
at
home
she
replied
with
shining
eyes
i
feel
as
if
our
mother
had
come
down
from
heaven
to
take
care
of
me
when
you
can
get
up
and
go
downstairs
you
will
be
happier
still
i
know
how
much
you
will
enjoy
meeting
the
whole
family
said
salo
then
you
will
feel
as
if
you
were
in
a
real
home
that
belongs
to
you
it
is
such
a
shame
that
you
have
to
go
leonore
sighed
but
this
time
the
tears
did
not
come
quite
so
urgently
how
things
had
changed
since
yesterday
how
different
it
was
now
to
stay
behind
at
this
moment
maxa
entered
the
room
she
had
left
it
as
she
wanted
to
give
brother
and
sister
an
opportunity
to
see
each
other
alone
but
the
time
had
come
for
salo
to
depart
and
he
was
obliged
to
leave
his
sister
it
seemed
harder
for
him
to
go
away
than
leave
leonore
behind
i
ca
even
say
that
i
wish
you
to
come
soon
i
have
to
hope
that
you
can
remain
here
a
long
while
he
said
cheerily
while
leonore
was
smiling
bravely
uncle
philip
ready
for
the
journey
stood
beside
the
carriage
all
the
children
ran
towards
salo
as
soon
as
he
appeared
and
when
he
said
he
was
treated
like
a
friend
of
the
family
of
many
years
standing
each
of
the
children
showed
his
grief
in
a
special
manner
mäzli
cried
loudly
over
and
over
again
oh
salo
please
come
soon
again
please
come
soon
again
when
the
carriage
was
rolling
away
and
the
handkerchiefs
that
fluttered
him
last
greetings
were
all
salo
could
see
from
the
distance
he
rapidly
brushed
away
a
few
tears
he
had
never
felt
so
thoroughly
at
home
anywhere
in
the
world
before
how
happy
he
had
been
the
thought
of
going
far
away
and
possibly
never
coming
back
gave
him
a
little
pang
of
grief
when
the
children
returned
at
noon
from
school
they
were
still
full
of
their
vivid
impression
of
salo
sudden
appearance
and
departure
they
were
all
anxious
to
tell
their
mother
about
it
because
they
knew
that
they
could
always
count
on
her
lively
sympathy
one
or
the
other
of
the
children
kept
forgetting
that
the
mother
must
not
be
sought
and
would
make
an
attempt
to
go
upstairs
but
they
were
always
met
by
unexpected
resistance
lippo
on
his
arrival
home
from
school
had
posted
himself
there
to
see
that
his
mother
orders
were
strictly
kept
he
also
had
missed
her
desperately
but
he
had
nevertheless
remembered
her
injunctions
and
was
quite
certain
that
the
others
might
forget
and
act
contrary
to
her
orders
placing
himself
on
the
first
step
he
would
hold
any
of
his
brothers
or
sisters
with
both
hands
when
they
came
towards
him
as
they
dashed
upstairs
when
he
cried
out
loudly
we
must
do
it
we
must
do
it
they
ran
away
again
quite
frightened
for
his
horrified
shrieks
might
have
penetrated
into
the
kathy
was
the
only
one
who
appreciated
lippo
worth
she
had
received
orders
to
remind
the
children
of
the
strict
command
and
she
knew
quite
well
from
previous
experiences
that
she
could
never
have
succeeded
as
effectively
as
he
mäzli
meanwhile
was
sitting
at
apollonie
table
gayly
eating
a
which
apollonie
knew
so
well
how
to
prepare
whenever
mäzli
came
to
a
meal
at
her
house
she
always
set
this
favorite
dish
before
the
child
the
days
when
mäzli
came
for
a
visit
here
were
happy
days
for
loneli
there
was
always
something
funny
going
on
at
because
mäzli
had
so
many
amusing
things
to
speak
about
on
those
days
she
was
never
obliged
to
tell
her
grandmother
exactly
what
lessons
she
had
known
in
school
and
which
she
had
not
usually
apollonie
was
dreadfully
anxious
to
hear
how
punctually
she
had
fulfilled
her
duties
and
she
always
chose
for
that
purpose
because
then
no
other
affair
interfered
with
talking
beaming
with
joy
loneli
now
sat
beside
mäzli
who
was
telling
uninterruptedly
about
salo
she
told
them
that
he
was
friendlier
and
nicer
than
any
boy
she
had
ever
seen
and
she
quoted
bruno
mea
and
kurt
as
saying
exactly
the
same
thing
usually
they
disagreed
on
such
points
apollonie
was
quite
absorbed
in
listening
too
and
nodding
her
head
once
in
a
while
she
seemed
to
say
yes
yes
i
know
that
he
could
be
called
salo
for
nothing
this
interesting
subject
of
conversation
kept
her
longer
than
usual
suddenly
she
started
up
quite
frightened
oh
is
it
possible
it
is
nearly
one
hurry
up
loneli
or
you
be
late
for
school
mäzli
you
and
i
have
something
to
do
too
this
afternoon
i
shall
take
you
on
a
walk
and
i
tell
you
where
we
are
going
as
soon
as
we
start
as
the
dishes
had
to
be
washed
first
apollonie
thought
that
mäzli
might
go
out
to
play
in
the
garden
but
mäzli
preferred
to
see
the
plates
washed
and
dried
and
afterwards
set
in
neat
rows
after
these
tasks
apollonie
put
on
a
good
apron
a
beautiful
and
after
packing
up
several
shirts
cloths
and
stockings
into
a
large
basket
the
two
set
out
where
are
we
going
mäzli
asked
inspecting
the
basket
who
are
you
taking
these
things
to
they
belong
to
trius
replied
apollonie
we
are
going
all
the
way
up
to
the
castle
as
far
as
the
great
iron
door
when
i
pull
the
trius
comes
and
gets
this
basket
you
be
able
to
peep
in
through
the
door
till
he
comes
back
again
with
the
empty
basket
can
one
look
into
the
garden
from
there
and
see
the
big
that
mama
liked
so
much
mäzli
asked
yes
yes
the
garden
is
there
apollonie
replied
with
a
profound
sigh
but
the
great
rose
and
mignonette
beds
are
gone
it
would
take
a
long
time
nowadays
to
find
even
a
couple
of
the
flowers
we
could
surely
find
them
inside
mäzli
said
with
great
certainty
but
mäzli
what
are
you
thinking
of
nobody
is
allowed
to
go
in
you
see
trius
lets
nobody
either
into
the
garden
or
into
the
castle
apollonie
repeated
with
great
emphasis
i
should
have
gone
in
long
ago
if
he
had
let
me
oh
how
i
should
have
loved
to
go
and
i
know
how
badly
needed
i
am
what
a
dreadful
disorder
all
the
rooms
must
be
in
if
i
could
only
go
a
single
time
to
do
the
most
necessary
things
apollonie
in
her
great
trouble
had
quite
forgotten
that
she
was
speaking
to
little
mäzli
why
should
you
bring
him
so
many
shirts
and
stockings
if
he
does
let
you
in
do
bring
him
anything
mäzli
cried
out
indignantly
no
no
mäzli
you
see
these
are
his
shirts
and
stockings
and
i
have
only
washed
and
mended
them
for
him
apollonie
explained
besides
trius
ca
do
as
he
pleases
do
you
see
the
open
windows
up
there
no
you
could
see
them
from
here
well
up
there
lives
a
sick
gentleman
a
baron
who
wo
let
anybody
come
into
the
garden
he
is
the
master
there
and
can
give
orders
and
people
must
not
disobey
him
look
one
can
see
the
open
windows
quite
plainly
now
can
we
see
the
bad
baron
too
asked
mäzli
peeping
up
searchingly
i
did
not
say
that
he
was
bad
mäzli
i
only
said
that
he
can
give
orders
apollonie
corrected
and
you
ca
see
him
because
he
is
lying
sick
in
bed
look
look
the
fine
thick
raspberry
bushes
used
to
be
there
apollonie
was
pointing
to
shrubs
that
were
climbing
up
the
castle
incline
oh
how
different
it
all
used
to
be
two
splendid
hedges
used
to
run
up
there
then
across
and
down
again
on
the
other
side
both
girls
and
boys
used
to
feast
on
them
for
whole
days
at
a
time
and
there
were
always
enough
left
for
pots
and
pots
full
of
jam
and
now
how
terrible
it
all
looks
everything
is
growing
wild
nobody
who
has
known
the
place
the
way
i
knew
it
could
have
ever
thought
that
it
would
look
like
this
mäzli
was
not
very
deeply
moved
by
the
change
she
had
long
been
gazing
at
the
high
gate
which
was
to
be
their
destination
and
which
they
were
nearing
rapidly
does
trius
take
his
big
stick
along
when
he
comes
down
to
the
gate
she
asked
looking
cautiously
about
her
yes
yes
he
never
goes
about
without
it
mäzli
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
apollonie
calmed
her
he
wo
hurt
you
and
i
should
advise
him
not
to
look
there
he
comes
already
he
has
been
spying
about
and
nothing
ever
escapes
him
trius
was
already
standing
at
the
gate
with
his
stick
and
opened
it
that
is
fine
he
said
receiving
the
basket
and
was
in
the
act
of
closing
the
door
again
immediately
no
no
trius
do
do
that
said
apollonie
restraining
him
she
had
vigorously
pushed
back
the
door
and
posted
herself
firmly
in
the
opening
i
always
do
my
duty
punctually
and
i
like
to
do
it
because
you
belong
to
the
castle
but
you
can
at
least
let
me
have
a
word
about
the
master
health
the
same
was
the
reply
the
same
what
does
that
mean
apollonie
retorted
do
you
watch
him
while
he
sleeps
are
you
cooking
the
right
things
for
him
what
does
the
master
eat
venison
what
how
can
you
cook
such
things
for
him
such
rich
and
heavy
meat
for
a
sick
man
what
does
the
doctor
say
to
that
nothing
what
nothing
he
certainly
must
say
what
his
patient
ought
to
eat
who
is
his
doctor
i
hope
a
good
one
i
am
afraid
the
master
is
not
troubling
much
about
it
did
you
fetch
the
one
from
sils
he
is
very
careful
i
know
no
who
do
you
have
no
one
apollonie
threw
up
her
arms
in
violent
agitation
so
the
baron
lies
up
there
sick
and
lonely
and
nobody
even
fetches
a
doctor
oh
if
his
mother
knew
this
that
simply
wo
do
and
i
am
going
in
please
let
me
in
the
master
wo
have
to
see
me
at
all
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
cook
something
strengthening
for
him
i
shall
only
put
his
room
in
order
and
if
he
happens
to
get
up
i
can
make
his
bed
oh
please
let
me
in
trius
you
know
that
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
please
let
me
nurse
the
sick
master
apollonie
voice
had
grown
supplicating
forbidden
was
the
curt
reply
but
i
am
no
stranger
here
i
have
served
in
this
house
for
more
than
thirty
years
apollonie
went
on
eagerly
i
know
what
is
needed
and
what
the
master
ought
to
have
things
are
not
attended
to
at
all
i
fear
and
indeed
i
know
it
after
all
i
am
an
old
acquaintance
and
only
come
an
hour
a
day
to
do
the
most
urgent
task
nobody
is
allowed
to
come
trius
said
again
in
his
unchangeable
dry
tone
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whether
apollonie
begged
or
scolded
in
her
anxiety
about
the
sick
master
she
had
forgotten
everything
else
where
is
the
child
she
suddenly
cried
out
in
great
anxiety
good
gracious
where
is
she
she
must
have
run
into
the
garden
trius
had
suddenly
grown
more
lively
throwing
the
gate
to
with
great
violence
he
turned
the
huge
key
before
pulling
it
rapidly
out
he
realized
that
apollonie
was
capable
of
doing
anything
in
her
excitement
about
the
lost
child
witch
baggage
he
murmured
angrily
swinging
his
stick
in
a
threatening
way
he
ran
towards
the
castle
trius
apollonie
screamed
after
him
with
all
her
might
if
you
touch
the
child
you
will
have
to
reckon
with
me
do
you
hear
hold
the
stick
down
she
ca
help
being
frightened
if
she
sees
you
but
he
had
quickly
been
lost
from
view
while
apollonie
and
trius
had
been
absorbed
in
their
violent
altercation
and
had
stared
at
each
other
she
in
wild
excitement
and
he
in
stiff
immovability
mäzli
had
slipped
from
between
the
two
as
swiftly
as
a
little
mouse
then
she
had
merrily
wandered
up
towards
the
castle
hoping
that
she
would
soon
see
the
garden
with
the
lovely
flowers
but
all
she
could
see
were
wild
bushes
and
stretches
of
grass
with
only
the
yellow
sparkling
flowers
which
grow
in
every
common
meadow
this
was
not
what
mäzli
had
expected
so
she
went
up
to
the
terrace
of
the
castle
and
looked
about
from
there
for
the
flower
garden
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
where
the
little
pine
wood
began
she
saw
something
that
looked
like
fiery
yellow
flowers
and
quickly
ran
there
but
instead
of
flowers
she
saw
a
lion
skin
shining
in
the
sun
to
see
what
was
under
the
skin
mäzli
came
closer
a
head
was
raised
up
and
two
sharp
eyes
were
directed
towards
her
it
was
a
man
who
had
half
raised
himself
on
the
long
chair
which
was
covered
by
the
skin
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
it
was
a
human
being
and
not
a
lion
she
came
nearer
and
asked
quite
confidentially
do
you
happen
to
know
where
the
beautiful
old
mignonette
is
that
mama
saw
in
the
garden
here
no
the
man
answered
curtly
maybe
trius
knows
but
one
ca
ask
him
are
you
afraid
of
trius
too
mäzli
asked
no
but
he
always
goes
about
with
a
big
stick
kurt
has
made
a
song
about
him
where
he
tells
everything
that
trius
does
mäzli
chattered
on
it
begins
like
this
old
trius
lives
in
our
town
a
haughty
man
is
he
and
every
one
that
he
can
catch
he
beats
right
heartily
i
do
remember
the
rest
but
it
is
quite
long
but
he
wants
to
make
a
song
about
salo
now
because
he
is
so
awfully
nice
he
said
it
as
soon
as
salo
went
away
today
we
all
like
him
and
bruno
said
that
if
he
made
a
stupid
song
he
would
tear
it
up
is
everybody
here
called
salo
and
bruno
the
gentleman
burst
out
angrily
no
nobody
except
bruno
you
know
he
is
my
big
brother
mäzli
explained
salo
only
came
yesterday
and
went
away
again
but
he
did
not
want
to
go
and
we
wanted
to
keep
him
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
if
his
sister
is
well
again
she
has
to
go
away
too
but
we
do
know
her
yet
her
name
is
leonore
who
sent
you
here
the
gentleman
ejaculated
harshly
but
mäzli
only
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
nobody
has
sent
me
nobody
knows
where
i
am
not
even
apollonie
mäzli
began
to
explain
i
only
ran
away
because
apollonie
had
to
tell
trius
so
many
things
and
i
wanted
to
see
the
mignonette
i
am
visiting
apollonie
because
mama
has
to
nurse
leonore
who
is
ill
and
ca
come
down
because
i
do
obey
kathy
very
well
and
she
has
to
cook
i
spend
the
days
with
apollonie
oh
here
he
comes
mäzli
interrupted
herself
suddenly
for
she
was
frightened
coming
close
to
her
new
acquaintance
as
if
to
seek
his
protection
she
whispered
confidentially
oh
you
help
me
please
if
he
tries
to
hurt
me
trius
was
rushing
towards
them
holding
out
his
stick
in
front
like
an
emblem
of
his
profession
the
gentleman
only
made
a
light
gesture
with
his
hand
and
trius
disappeared
as
he
had
come
wo
he
hurt
me
if
i
come
down
to
the
door
where
he
stands
mäzli
asked
she
retreated
slightly
from
her
protector
whom
she
had
held
tightly
in
her
fear
of
the
stick
no
he
replied
curtly
but
his
voice
did
not
sound
as
severe
as
before
a
fact
which
mäzli
noticed
immediately
she
was
very
grateful
to
him
for
chasing
trius
away
and
she
now
felt
desirous
of
doing
him
a
service
in
return
do
you
always
have
to
sit
alone
here
all
the
time
does
no
one
come
to
see
you
she
asked
full
of
sympathy
no
oh
then
i
must
come
to
you
another
time
and
i
keep
you
company
mäzli
said
consolingly
does
the
bad
baron
never
come
down
to
you
here
she
asked
anxiously
where
is
he
came
a
second
question
do
you
know
that
mäzli
said
in
great
surprise
he
is
up
there
where
the
windows
are
open
with
this
mäzli
looked
up
and
walking
close
to
the
chair
whispered
cautiously
a
sick
baron
lies
up
there
apollonie
says
that
he
is
not
bad
but
i
know
that
one
has
to
be
afraid
of
him
are
you
afraid
of
him
no
then
i
wo
be
afraid
of
him
either
mäzli
remarked
quite
reassured
the
gentleman
who
had
chased
away
trius
so
easily
and
was
not
afraid
of
the
bad
baron
gave
her
all
the
confidence
in
the
world
under
his
protection
she
could
face
every
danger
i
go
home
now
but
i
come
soon
again
and
with
this
mäzli
gave
her
hand
in
a
most
winning
way
when
she
wanted
to
say
she
realized
that
she
did
not
know
either
the
gentleman
name
or
title
so
she
stopped
i
am
the
castle
steward
said
the
gentleman
helping
mäzli
when
the
was
done
mäzli
ran
back
towards
the
door
sure
enough
trius
was
standing
inside
the
portals
and
apollonie
on
the
outside
for
the
careful
man
had
not
opened
them
again
he
thought
that
the
excited
woman
might
forcibly
enter
the
garden
in
order
to
seek
the
child
god
be
thanked
that
you
are
here
again
she
cried
when
mäzli
came
out
she
quickly
took
her
hand
trius
after
violently
shutting
the
gate
had
immediately
turned
his
back
upon
the
visitors
i
was
simply
frightened
to
death
mäzli
how
could
you
run
away
from
me
i
did
not
know
where
you
had
got
to
you
did
need
to
be
so
frightened
mäzli
said
with
calm
assurance
i
was
with
the
i
do
need
to
be
afraid
of
anything
with
him
not
even
of
mr
trius
what
the
what
are
you
saying
mäzli
who
said
it
was
the
steward
apollonie
words
were
full
of
anxiety
as
if
mäzli
might
be
threatened
with
great
danger
he
told
me
so
himself
he
was
sitting
all
alone
under
a
big
tree
he
sits
there
alone
all
the
time
but
i
am
going
up
to
see
him
soon
again
mäzli
informed
her
no
no
mäzli
what
are
you
thinking
of
you
ca
do
it
if
he
has
not
told
you
to
i
am
sure
trius
will
see
that
you
wo
get
in
there
any
more
said
apollonie
and
she
was
quite
sure
that
mäzli
plan
would
never
succeed
but
if
mäzli
ever
made
a
discovery
she
was
not
easily
led
away
yes
but
he
wo
be
allowed
to
stop
me
she
said
a
little
scornfully
that
evening
loneli
was
allowed
to
bring
mäzli
home
she
always
loved
to
go
to
maxa
house
because
kurt
and
mea
were
her
best
friends
loneli
was
always
so
friendly
and
obliging
to
everybody
that
the
school
children
often
asked
her
to
deliver
messages
this
often
took
place
in
cases
of
estrangements
when
a
third
person
was
needed
loneli
had
been
asked
after
school
to
give
a
message
to
mea
and
she
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
deliver
it
mea
had
sent
a
proposal
of
peace
to
elvira
through
loneli
for
she
hated
the
constant
sulking
of
her
friend
and
the
unpleasant
new
manner
she
exhibited
in
turning
her
back
upon
her
mea
had
twice
before
tried
to
be
reconciled
to
the
embittered
elvira
but
unfortunately
in
vain
she
did
not
dare
to
admit
this
to
kurt
who
would
not
have
approved
of
her
behaviour
but
would
have
even
made
a
horrible
song
about
it
but
one
could
always
rely
on
loneli
who
was
discreet
mea
standing
at
the
window
saw
loneli
coming
towards
the
house
and
ran
down
to
meet
her
i
have
to
tell
you
something
terribly
sad
about
elvira
loneli
said
quite
downcast
what
is
it
what
is
it
mea
asked
she
does
ever
want
to
renew
her
friendship
with
you
and
she
has
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
you
may
be
sure
that
i
should
not
tell
you
if
i
did
not
have
to
loneli
added
because
it
makes
me
so
sad
mea
reflected
a
moment
wondering
what
she
had
really
done
all
she
had
been
guilty
of
was
accusing
elvira
of
an
act
of
injustice
so
all
friendly
feelings
between
them
were
to
be
withdrawn
for
all
time
as
her
punishment
elvira
can
sulk
for
the
rest
of
eternity
if
she
wants
to
mea
said
now
without
the
slightest
trace
of
sadness
loneli
was
greatly
surprised
there
are
other
people
in
this
world
besides
her
i
should
have
loved
to
tell
elvira
who
was
staying
with
us
never
has
anybody
been
so
nice
and
pleased
us
so
i
wish
i
could
have
told
her
who
is
here
now
though
we
do
know
her
yet
but
elvira
keeps
on
turning
her
back
on
me
you
see
loneli
the
nicest
boy
about
bruno
age
came
to
see
us
and
his
sister
is
sick
upstairs
we
are
not
allowed
to
see
her
just
yet
but
i
can
hardly
wait
till
she
comes
down
if
she
is
as
nice
as
her
brother
she
is
the
nicest
child
any
of
us
have
ever
seen
at
this
description
loneli
vivacious
eyes
fairly
gleamed
with
sympathy
what
is
her
name
she
asked
expectantly
leonore
mea
answered
oh
loneli
immediately
began
my
grandmother
also
knew
a
young
lady
called
leonore
she
always
says
that
that
young
lady
was
as
lovely
as
an
angel
and
that
there
could
not
be
anybody
in
the
world
as
wonderful
as
she
i
am
rather
glad
if
leonore
is
not
like
an
angel
for
she
might
not
be
my
friend
then
mea
said
quickly
elvira
even
who
certainly
is
not
at
all
like
an
angel
has
to
break
her
friendship
with
me
every
few
weeks
maybe
she
does
that
because
she
is
so
little
like
an
angel
loneli
suggested
at
this
both
children
laughed
often
loneli
found
exactly
the
right
word
to
say
which
would
throw
light
on
the
matter
kurt
always
enjoyed
these
remarks
of
hers
at
that
moment
shrieks
of
joy
sounded
from
the
house
mama
is
coming
mama
is
coming
lippo
the
watchman
had
posted
himself
again
on
the
stairs
as
soon
as
he
had
returned
from
school
and
he
had
found
ample
work
there
kurt
had
again
forgotten
the
command
and
had
to
be
chased
away
and
even
bruno
had
made
an
attempt
to
quietly
steal
up
to
his
mother
but
all
this
had
only
brought
horrified
cries
from
the
little
boy
they
had
both
meant
no
wrong
whatever
all
they
had
wanted
was
to
quickly
say
a
word
to
the
mother
through
the
open
door
nevertheless
lippo
had
grown
terribly
wrought
up
about
it
a
firm
command
had
been
given
and
they
had
tried
to
break
it
so
they
all
had
been
obliged
to
give
way
before
his
violent
noise
a
strange
gentleman
had
come
too
who
was
up
the
stairs
with
two
leaps
but
lippo
had
grabbed
the
tails
of
his
coat
and
holding
on
to
them
with
both
hands
shrieked
nobody
is
allowed
to
go
up
you
must
not
go
up
laughingly
turning
about
the
gentleman
said
just
let
me
go
little
one
i
am
allowed
because
i
am
the
doctor
your
uncle
told
me
where
to
go
so
i
easily
find
my
way
but
i
make
use
of
you
some
day
for
you
are
a
splendid
sentinel
when
the
doctor
on
his
return
found
him
still
on
the
same
spot
he
called
him
a
pillar
of
good
order
and
told
him
that
he
would
send
for
him
if
he
should
ever
need
a
reliable
watchman
soon
after
lippo
uttered
sudden
shouts
of
joy
for
he
saw
his
mother
coming
downstairs
what
a
surprise
it
was
to
see
her
when
they
had
thought
that
she
would
be
shut
up
for
one
or
two
days
longer
mama
is
coming
mama
is
coming
all
had
heard
his
exclamations
and
mea
was
the
first
to
appear
pulling
loneli
after
her
bruno
came
rushing
from
one
side
and
kurt
from
the
other
and
mäzli
shot
like
an
arrow
right
into
their
midst
the
mother
found
herself
solidly
surrounded
mama
just
think
oh
listen
mama
oh
mama
i
want
to
tell
you
do
you
know
mama
this
came
from
all
sides
and
all
at
once
children
said
the
mother
we
must
be
very
happy
that
we
can
see
each
other
so
soon
again
i
wanted
to
send
one
of
you
to
apollonie
but
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
loneli
maxa
now
told
loneli
the
message
she
was
to
take
to
her
grandmother
the
doctor
had
just
been
there
and
had
found
leonore
much
better
already
as
her
fever
had
gone
down
he
feared
no
serious
illness
leonore
was
to
spend
several
more
days
in
bed
and
therefore
she
was
to
have
a
nurse
who
could
also
take
care
of
her
at
for
this
nobody
better
than
grandmother
apollonie
could
be
found
and
maxa
would
be
so
glad
for
her
patient
and
her
own
sake
if
she
could
arrange
to
come
to
the
house
for
several
days
and
nights
she
told
loneli
to
tell
her
grandmother
that
the
little
girl
was
named
leonore
and
that
maxa
was
quite
sure
she
would
not
be
hard
to
take
care
of
the
mother
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
detained
any
longer
to
all
the
questions
which
stormed
in
upon
her
she
only
had
one
answer
children
then
she
disappeared
again
into
the
sick
room
please
tell
me
what
she
is
like
when
you
have
seen
her
i
am
so
curious
said
loneli
taking
leave
and
mea
promised
to
give
the
sympathetic
loneli
a
full
report
of
everything
next
morning
extremely
early
apollonie
appeared
at
maxa
house
as
the
door
was
not
open
yet
she
knocked
quietly
and
after
a
while
kathy
appeared
with
heavy
sleepy
eyes
why
should
anybody
rush
about
at
this
early
hour
she
said
a
little
angrily
it
did
not
suit
her
at
all
that
apollonie
should
have
found
out
what
a
short
time
she
had
been
astir
i
begin
my
day
at
this
hour
said
apollonie
and
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
rush
about
i
can
leave
that
to
those
who
get
up
late
i
have
come
to
take
rector
place
in
the
sick
room
she
has
even
called
yet
kathy
flung
out
so
much
the
better
then
i
have
at
least
not
come
too
late
i
can
find
some
work
everywhere
and
with
this
apollonie
entered
the
living
room
and
began
to
set
it
in
order
kathy
did
not
hinder
her
and
to
show
her
gratitude
attempted
to
start
a
little
conversation
but
apollonie
was
not
in
the
mood
for
that
she
was
solely
filled
by
the
question
who
the
sick
leonore
was
that
she
was
going
to
nurse
could
it
be
possible
that
moment
a
bell
sounded
from
upstairs
and
apollonie
obeyed
the
call
maxa
opening
the
door
let
her
enter
wide
awake
leonore
was
sitting
up
in
bed
her
thick
curly
hair
was
falling
far
down
below
her
shoulders
and
her
dark
solemn
eyes
were
gazing
with
surprise
at
apollonie
the
latter
looked
immovably
at
the
little
girl
while
tears
were
coursing
down
her
cheeks
oh
oh
she
said
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
control
her
emotion
one
does
not
need
to
ask
where
our
little
leonore
comes
from
it
seems
to
me
as
if
old
times
had
come
back
again
yes
she
looked
exactly
like
that
when
she
came
to
the
castle
only
she
was
not
quite
so
pale
leonore
maxa
said
apollonie
has
known
both
your
father
and
mother
very
well
so
i
thought
that
you
would
like
to
have
her
for
a
nurse
certainly
leonore
replied
happily
while
she
stretched
out
her
hand
in
a
friendly
manner
towards
apollonie
wo
you
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
them
apollonie
was
only
too
glad
to
do
that
but
in
her
agitation
she
had
first
to
wipe
her
eyes
there
was
no
end
to
the
children
enthusiasm
when
they
found
that
their
mother
was
to
be
their
own
again
the
unaccustomed
separation
had
seemed
much
longer
and
harder
to
bear
than
they
had
imagined
but
it
was
all
over
now
she
was
back
and
would
be
theirs
now
for
all
time
to
come
bruno
suggested
that
they
should
divide
up
their
mother
time
between
them
this
would
make
it
possible
for
all
to
get
her
hearing
separately
in
all
this
time
a
great
deal
of
matter
had
accumulated
which
was
crying
to
be
heard
if
they
were
all
to
talk
to
her
at
once
as
had
happened
several
times
before
no
one
would
have
any
satisfaction
as
she
might
not
even
be
able
to
understand
them
so
it
was
settled
that
every
child
should
have
their
mother
alone
for
an
hour
and
they
were
to
take
their
turns
according
to
age
so
of
course
the
first
hour
after
school
from
eleven
till
twelve
belongs
to
me
was
bruno
statement
from
one
till
two
i
shall
have
my
turn
mea
cried
out
she
was
counting
on
asking
her
mother
so
many
questions
that
they
might
easily
take
three
hours
she
had
no
communications
to
make
but
she
was
terribly
eager
to
hear
all
about
leonore
i
get
the
time
between
four
and
five
said
kurt
this
term
suited
him
exactly
as
he
had
a
secret
hope
of
prolonging
it
somewhat
the
two
little
ones
were
to
have
the
remaining
time
before
supper
and
kurt
thought
that
they
could
not
have
very
much
to
tell
whereas
he
was
in
need
of
a
great
deal
of
advice
the
mother
had
been
quite
certain
that
bruno
in
his
interview
with
her
would
make
a
last
desperate
effort
to
escape
having
to
live
with
the
knippel
boys
what
was
her
surprise
when
she
found
that
this
had
been
entirely
pushed
into
the
background
by
his
lively
sympathy
in
destiny
bruno
thoughts
were
constantly
occupied
by
the
thought
that
his
new
charming
friend
stood
entirely
alone
in
the
world
as
salo
had
no
one
who
could
help
him
to
find
a
home
bruno
hoped
that
his
mother
would
be
able
to
give
him
some
advice
he
felt
sure
that
she
would
gladly
do
this
for
she
loved
both
children
tenderly
as
she
had
formerly
loved
their
parents
the
boy
had
been
absolutely
right
when
he
supposed
that
maxa
would
be
glad
to
help
them
but
she
had
to
tell
bruno
frankly
that
there
was
no
advice
she
was
able
to
give
she
had
no
authority
over
the
children
and
could
therefore
do
nothing
as
everything
depended
on
salo
early
completion
of
his
studies
so
that
he
could
choose
an
occupation
this
would
have
to
be
settled
by
the
gentleman
of
whom
salo
had
spoken
he
was
probably
a
relation
of
their
mother
who
had
undertaken
the
care
of
the
children
bruno
was
terribly
cast
down
when
he
heard
this
when
his
mother
did
not
give
him
help
and
counsel
right
away
she
usually
gave
him
some
hope
by
saying
we
shall
see
as
she
had
not
said
this
he
felt
certain
that
nothing
could
be
done
but
the
mother
unhappy
face
showed
to
bruno
that
her
disability
did
not
come
from
a
lack
of
sympathy
and
that
it
pained
her
very
much
that
she
could
do
nothing
when
bruno
came
out
of
the
room
he
was
very
silent
and
sadder
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
mea
on
the
contrary
came
skipping
out
from
her
interview
her
mother
had
told
her
that
leonore
was
charming
refined
and
modest
besides
being
extremely
grateful
for
every
little
favor
but
what
thrilled
mea
beyond
everything
was
that
leonore
had
repeatedly
told
her
mother
how
much
she
looked
forward
to
meeting
her
because
the
two
were
of
an
age
only
fear
was
that
mea
might
find
her
rather
tiresome
all
the
girls
in
the
boarding
school
had
always
accused
her
of
that
for
she
was
often
terribly
unhappy
and
she
could
not
help
it
mea
was
more
eager
than
ever
now
to
meet
leonore
for
she
was
already
filled
with
a
warm
love
for
the
sick
child
she
could
talk
and
think
of
practically
nothing
but
leonore
i
certainly
have
to
make
a
song
about
this
violent
new
friendship
kurt
said
in
the
evening
when
mea
had
urged
more
than
once
oh
mother
i
hope
you
wo
let
leonore
go
as
soon
as
she
can
come
down
and
the
doctor
says
she
is
well
otherwise
we
shall
barely
be
able
to
become
acquainted
mea
flared
like
a
rocket
at
her
brother
suggestion
crying
violently
indeed
you
wo
kurt
mea
mea
the
mother
admonished
her
i
propose
to
do
all
i
can
to
keep
leonore
here
as
long
as
possible
but
but
mea
she
might
be
put
to
flight
with
fear
and
never
be
seen
again
if
you
attack
your
poor
brothers
in
such
a
way
kurt
quickly
concluded
the
mother
sentence
mea
had
to
laugh
over
this
speech
which
little
resembled
her
style
of
talking
my
dear
kurt
she
said
i
am
quite
able
to
complete
a
sentence
without
your
assistance
i
wanted
to
say
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
do
very
much
because
the
ladies
will
take
leonore
when
it
suits
them
best
i
have
to
admit
however
that
there
was
some
truth
in
kurt
reply
leonore
has
such
a
delicate
refined
nature
that
it
might
frighten
her
to
see
you
carried
away
by
such
passion
mea
when
the
doctor
came
back
again
in
two
days
he
was
surprised
at
the
improved
condition
of
his
little
patient
if
she
was
not
so
very
young
the
doctor
said
to
maxa
while
she
accompanied
him
out
of
the
room
i
should
say
that
her
illness
came
largely
from
some
hidden
sorrow
and
inner
suffering
she
has
apparently
been
able
to
shake
it
off
in
the
good
care
and
affectionate
treatment
she
is
getting
here
but
i
can
scarcely
believe
this
of
a
child
when
maxa
asked
him
how
soon
leonore
could
leave
the
room
and
spend
the
day
with
her
very
active
children
he
answered
she
can
do
it
from
on
nothing
can
possibly
refresh
her
more
than
some
lively
playmates
with
this
he
took
his
leave
going
downstairs
he
met
apollonie
who
was
just
coming
up
with
a
laden
with
delicate
dishes
for
the
sick
child
that
is
right
said
the
doctor
it
gives
one
an
appetite
only
to
look
at
it
yes
the
poor
child
eats
like
a
little
bird
said
apollonie
but
rector
says
that
there
must
be
things
to
choose
from
in
order
to
tempt
her
how
is
she
getting
along
doctor
do
you
think
she
get
well
again
is
she
just
like
a
little
angel
that
is
hard
for
me
to
say
as
i
do
not
know
any
angels
he
said
smiling
but
she
might
be
for
all
i
know
i
am
sure
that
she
will
get
well
with
careful
nursing
and
you
are
sure
to
see
to
that
apollonie
you
seem
to
think
that
in
being
given
care
of
the
child
you
have
drawn
the
big
prize
in
the
lottery
indeed
i
have
i
really
have
she
cried
after
him
no
event
had
ever
been
looked
forward
to
with
such
great
suspense
in
maxa
house
as
the
appearance
of
leonore
as
soon
as
all
the
children
were
home
from
school
the
next
morning
their
mother
fetched
her
down
the
three
older
ones
were
standing
expectantly
together
in
a
little
group
while
the
two
smaller
ones
had
placed
themselves
with
eyes
near
the
door
leonore
entering
greeted
one
after
the
other
in
such
an
engaging
confidential
way
that
she
made
them
feel
as
if
they
were
old
friends
she
loved
their
mother
so
much
and
had
been
so
closely
drawn
to
her
that
she
was
fond
of
the
children
before
she
had
even
seen
them
this
pleased
them
tremendously
for
they
had
expected
leonore
to
be
very
different
from
themselves
and
had
been
rather
afraid
of
her
as
soon
as
they
saw
her
they
felt
that
they
might
each
be
special
friends
with
their
charming
guest
leonore
found
herself
surrounded
by
them
all
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
as
she
did
not
look
at
all
strong
yet
the
mother
had
led
her
there
leonore
tried
to
answer
all
the
questions
listen
to
all
the
projects
and
information
which
were
showered
upon
her
while
her
eyes
danced
with
merriment
these
unusual
surroundings
made
leonore
so
happy
that
her
face
became
quite
rosy
mea
had
been
already
completed
in
her
mind
a
plan
which
if
it
succeeded
would
make
it
possible
for
her
to
have
leonore
to
herself
sometimes
since
all
her
brothers
and
sisters
liked
the
visitor
so
much
it
was
not
easy
to
get
her
off
alone
if
only
her
mother
would
sanction
the
plan
that
day
mea
had
to
set
the
table
and
when
lunch
time
had
come
she
quickly
ran
to
her
mother
to
ask
her
if
she
might
take
apollonie
place
in
room
and
to
her
great
delight
she
willingly
consented
mea
told
her
she
would
only
be
too
glad
to
wait
on
leonore
at
night
if
she
could
but
be
with
her
leonore
really
needed
no
more
special
care
and
in
case
of
an
emergency
mea
could
easily
run
down
to
fetch
her
mother
leonore
will
mean
more
to
you
than
she
will
ever
realize
the
mother
concluded
and
i
feel
very
gratified
if
you
can
do
something
for
her
too
maxa
then
informed
apollonie
of
the
new
plan
and
she
felt
sure
that
the
latter
would
be
glad
to
get
home
again
i
do
everything
in
my
power
for
that
angel
she
exclaimed
i
should
go
to
live
in
the
desert
if
only
i
could
procure
a
home
for
her
after
dinner
she
went
to
leonore
to
say
and
the
child
pressed
her
hand
most
warmly
thanking
her
for
the
good
care
she
had
received
i
shall
never
forget
how
kind
you
have
been
apollonie
she
said
heartily
i
shall
come
to
see
you
as
soon
as
i
am
allowed
to
go
i
hope
that
we
shall
see
each
other
very
often
oh
yes
i
hope
so
please
ask
rector
to
let
you
come
to
me
as
often
as
possible
said
apollonie
before
leaving
leonore
now
told
the
children
that
apollonie
had
very
vividly
described
to
her
the
lovely
home
of
her
parents
and
the
wonderful
life
in
the
castle
she
had
said
frankly
that
she
would
never
desire
such
a
fine
home
if
only
salo
and
she
could
call
a
little
house
their
own
so
the
apollonie
had
suggested
that
they
might
live
with
her
she
could
easily
let
them
have
the
whole
cottage
with
the
exception
of
a
tiny
chamber
she
could
wait
on
them
and
what
more
could
they
desire
leonore
had
felt
that
this
would
be
better
than
anything
she
had
dreamed
of
as
she
could
come
over
to
maxa
and
her
children
as
often
as
she
pleased
how
happy
salo
would
be
if
she
wrote
him
about
it
yes
you
can
mäzli
declared
her
house
is
a
lovely
place
to
live
in
loneli
is
there
who
does
everything
one
wants
her
to
and
apollonie
always
cooks
what
one
likes
best
kurt
made
a
little
enigmatical
remark
to
mäzli
about
her
greed
but
before
she
could
have
it
explained
to
her
the
mother
turned
to
leonore
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
deluded
by
this
thought
dear
child
she
said
for
that
might
only
bring
you
disappointment
as
soon
as
you
are
well
you
can
walk
to
apollonie
cottage
and
then
you
will
see
what
a
tiny
place
it
is
the
great
obstacle
of
salo
studies
would
not
be
put
aside
in
that
way
either
for
he
could
not
join
you
there
for
years
oh
i
was
thinking
all
the
time
how
lovely
it
would
be
to
live
with
apollonie
it
would
be
so
wonderful
i
could
live
with
her
there
and
salo
could
come
to
us
in
the
holidays
till
he
is
through
with
his
studies
then
we
could
both
settle
here
in
the
neighborhood
leonore
had
been
counting
on
this
new
scheme
and
she
looked
up
at
maxa
as
if
she
longed
for
her
consent
as
maxa
did
not
have
the
heart
to
shatter
the
child
hopes
completely
she
decided
to
let
the
matter
rest
for
the
present
as
soon
as
they
could
visit
apollonie
leonore
could
judge
for
herself
how
impossible
the
plan
was
leonore
eyes
were
usually
very
sad
but
occasionally
she
would
look
quite
merry
and
it
was
so
that
she
appeared
that
evening
when
the
children
were
surrounding
her
on
all
sides
when
each
had
to
tell
her
so
much
and
tried
to
be
nearest
her
she
experienced
the
feeling
that
she
had
come
to
a
family
to
which
she
really
belonged
each
of
the
children
had
founded
a
special
relation
with
leonore
bruno
saw
himself
as
her
protector
and
adviser
and
as
her
brother
close
friend
he
meant
to
keep
an
active
watch
over
her
mea
whose
thoughts
had
been
completely
absorbed
for
days
in
her
new
friend
brought
her
all
the
warmth
of
a
heart
which
craved
friendship
passionately
kurt
had
made
it
his
duty
to
cheer
up
the
rather
melancholy
child
as
much
as
was
in
his
power
lippo
still
filled
a
little
with
his
post
of
sentinel
always
came
close
to
her
as
if
he
still
needed
to
watch
over
her
mäzli
was
of
the
firm
opinion
that
she
had
to
entertain
the
guest
so
she
would
relate
fragments
of
funny
things
she
knew
passing
from
one
to
another
in
this
way
leonore
got
to
hear
of
the
knippel
family
the
time
passed
so
quickly
that
loud
laments
were
heard
when
the
mother
announced
that
it
was
time
for
leonore
to
retire
she
did
not
want
her
strength
to
be
overtaxed
on
her
first
day
out
of
bed
we
shall
have
many
more
days
after
this
when
we
can
be
together
she
added
let
us
be
glad
of
that
there
might
not
be
so
many
for
i
feel
quite
well
already
leonore
said
with
a
sigh
maxa
smiled
we
must
thank
god
for
that
but
you
need
to
get
strong
and
i
hope
that
you
may
find
the
needed
recreation
and
change
here
then
she
accompanied
the
two
girls
up
to
their
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
as
mea
was
to
be
leonore
sole
nurse
from
now
on
maxa
wanted
to
reassure
herself
that
nothing
was
missing
it
was
in
mea
nature
to
endow
every
new
friend
with
marvellous
qualities
her
imagination
was
always
as
active
as
her
heart
which
she
gave
unreservedly
on
such
occasions
unfortunately
mea
suffered
many
disappointments
in
that
way
because
on
nearer
acquaintance
her
friends
very
seldom
came
up
to
her
expectations
she
always
tried
hard
to
hold
on
to
the
original
image
even
if
it
did
not
in
the
least
coincide
with
what
her
friends
proved
to
be
in
reality
and
this
brought
on
numberless
fights
with
kurt
who
with
his
usual
shrewdness
could
not
help
revealing
to
her
the
real
state
of
affairs
this
always
disillusioned
her
finally
for
it
was
hard
to
deny
his
proofs
whenever
another
girl
woke
a
passionate
love
in
her
she
was
bound
to
expect
something
unusual
from
her
a
week
had
passed
since
leonore
had
spent
her
first
day
as
convalescent
among
the
family
as
mea
had
the
privilege
of
being
in
the
closest
most
intimate
contact
with
her
new
friend
in
the
late
evening
hours
she
was
in
a
state
of
perfect
bliss
every
moment
of
the
day
that
she
was
home
she
tried
to
be
at
leonore
side
and
in
her
walks
to
and
from
school
there
existed
for
her
no
other
subject
of
conversation
than
leonore
it
was
quite
unusual
that
kurt
had
not
produced
a
rhyme
about
her
great
devotion
he
had
not
once
said
things
will
be
different
after
a
while
brother
and
sister
this
time
were
entirely
of
one
opinion
about
her
it
even
seemed
as
if
kurt
himself
had
caught
a
touch
of
the
friendship
fever
as
he
used
to
call
mea
great
devotion
apparently
bruno
was
of
the
same
opinion
too
in
all
his
free
hours
he
used
to
sit
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
his
books
paying
no
attention
to
anything
else
but
since
leonore
had
come
he
always
joined
the
merry
group
and
generally
had
something
to
relate
or
to
show
for
entertainment
this
he
did
in
a
quiet
gentler
manner
such
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
hardly
have
behaved
otherwise
lippo
felt
so
comfortable
in
leonore
presence
that
he
always
kept
as
close
to
her
as
possible
even
when
he
told
his
experiences
at
great
length
she
never
became
impatient
but
encouraged
him
to
go
on
when
his
brothers
and
sisters
made
sarcastic
remarks
about
him
from
time
to
time
he
would
confidentially
say
to
her
just
stay
with
us
always
leonore
you
are
at
home
here
now
even
if
you
have
no
home
anywhere
else
this
was
uttered
in
a
spirit
of
utter
conviction
as
the
little
boy
had
heard
it
from
her
own
lips
and
was
sure
that
this
would
be
the
best
for
them
all
leonore
blushed
a
deep
scarlet
at
these
words
as
if
lippo
had
pronounced
a
thought
she
did
not
dare
to
foster
in
her
own
heart
once
his
mother
had
noticed
this
so
she
told
lippo
one
evening
not
to
say
this
again
as
it
was
impossible
to
keep
leonore
it
was
much
better
not
to
speak
of
it
as
it
only
gave
her
pain
as
this
was
a
firm
command
lippo
obeyed
faithfully
he
kept
on
however
showing
leonore
that
he
loved
to
be
with
her
mäzli
love
for
leonore
showed
itself
more
than
anything
in
a
wish
to
lend
her
a
helping
hand
in
many
things
which
the
little
girl
felt
her
lovely
friend
stood
in
need
of
she
had
seen
quite
plainly
that
leonore
often
became
very
sad
when
everyone
else
about
her
was
laughing
and
she
herself
had
been
quite
bright
a
moment
before
but
mäzli
knew
how
she
was
going
to
help
she
meant
to
tell
apollonie
how
to
fit
up
her
cottage
for
leonore
and
salo
who
she
hoped
would
spend
his
holidays
there
too
she
meant
to
superintend
these
preparations
herself
and
to
have
it
all
fixed
as
daintily
as
possible
by
this
time
mea
new
friend
was
adored
by
the
whole
family
and
they
showed
it
by
doing
all
in
their
power
for
her
they
had
agreed
that
she
differed
absolutely
from
mea
former
friends
they
could
not
analyze
wherein
lay
the
charm
which
pervaded
her
whole
personality
the
children
had
never
known
anybody
who
was
so
polite
towards
everyone
including
kathy
who
only
spoke
affectionate
tender
words
and
always
seemed
so
grateful
when
others
were
kind
to
her
this
spirit
was
something
new
and
extremely
delightful
they
had
to
admit
to
themselves
that
they
wished
everybody
would
act
in
such
a
way
as
this
would
do
away
forever
with
the
fights
and
altercations
that
had
always
arisen
between
them
and
for
which
they
were
afterwards
always
sorry
the
only
thing
they
would
have
been
glad
to
change
in
leonore
were
her
sudden
fits
of
gloom
which
affected
them
all
leonore
tried
very
hard
to
fight
these
depressing
thoughts
but
they
went
so
deep
that
she
seldom
succeeded
their
mother
consoled
them
by
saying
that
leonore
would
get
stronger
as
soon
as
she
could
take
walks
with
them
in
the
woods
and
meadows
and
that
feelings
which
now
weighed
on
her
would
then
seem
lighter
a
few
days
later
the
children
including
leonore
came
back
with
rosy
cheeks
and
glowing
eyes
from
their
first
walk
to
the
surrounding
hills
the
fresh
mountain
breeze
had
exhilarated
them
so
much
that
the
feeling
of
was
laughing
from
their
young
faces
even
cheeks
that
were
usually
so
pale
were
faintly
tinged
with
a
rosy
hue
the
mother
stepped
out
of
the
garden
into
the
road
in
order
to
welcome
the
children
oh
she
cried
out
joyfully
this
first
walk
has
been
splendid
leonore
looks
like
a
fresh
taking
her
hand
with
great
tenderness
between
her
own
she
gazed
at
her
very
closely
in
order
to
rejoice
over
the
rosy
color
on
the
delicate
face
that
moment
a
approached
holding
by
each
hand
a
little
girl
the
children
clothes
were
so
ragged
that
their
little
bodies
were
scarcely
covered
looking
at
maxa
the
said
yes
yes
children
can
make
one
happy
enough
when
one
has
a
home
you
are
a
fortunate
lady
to
have
a
good
roof
for
your
own
it
would
be
better
for
two
such
homeless
ones
as
these
not
to
exist
they
are
sure
to
remain
homeless
all
their
lives
and
that
is
the
saddest
thing
of
all
with
that
she
stretched
out
her
hand
for
maxa
was
looking
at
her
intently
leonore
had
quickly
taken
off
her
shawl
and
jacket
may
i
give
it
to
them
she
asked
maxa
in
a
low
voice
the
had
already
noticed
the
girl
gesture
and
stretched
out
her
hands
in
her
direction
i
am
glad
young
lady
that
you
have
pity
for
these
homeless
ones
even
if
you
do
not
know
what
that
means
god
bless
you
leonore
looked
imploringly
into
maxa
face
the
latter
nodded
as
it
was
too
late
now
to
explain
to
leonore
what
action
would
have
been
better
she
made
up
her
mind
to
do
it
afterwards
for
similar
occasions
with
many
words
the
poor
woman
thanked
her
for
the
gift
she
was
very
anxious
to
kiss
the
young
lady
hand
for
the
two
garments
but
leonore
had
immediately
run
away
mea
followed
and
found
leonore
who
had
been
so
merry
on
the
walk
sitting
in
her
crying
bitterly
with
her
head
between
her
hands
what
is
the
matter
leonore
why
do
you
cry
so
terribly
mea
asked
quite
frightened
she
could
not
answer
at
once
the
mother
and
the
other
children
had
come
in
too
and
now
they
all
surrounded
the
sobbing
girl
in
great
amazement
and
sympathy
that
is
the
way
i
am
she
said
at
last
sobbing
aloud
i
am
homeless
like
them
anyone
who
is
homeless
has
to
remain
so
always
and
it
is
terrible
that
is
what
the
woman
said
and
i
believe
her
how
should
one
find
a
home
if
one
ca
look
for
one
leonore
had
never
before
broken
out
into
such
passionate
grief
maxa
looked
at
her
very
sorrowfully
she
is
a
real
wallerstätten
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
said
to
herself
that
will
mean
more
struggles
for
her
than
i
thought
at
a
sign
from
her
the
children
plainly
understood
that
she
asked
them
to
go
into
the
garden
for
a
little
while
sitting
down
beside
leonore
she
took
her
hand
between
her
own
and
waited
till
the
violent
outbreak
had
ceased
then
she
said
tenderly
oh
leonore
do
you
remember
what
you
told
me
once
when
you
were
ill
and
i
was
sitting
on
your
bed
you
told
me
that
you
found
a
song
among
your
mother
music
which
always
comforted
you
when
you
seemed
to
lose
courage
and
confidence
in
god
you
said
that
it
always
made
you
feel
that
he
was
not
forgetting
you
and
your
brother
and
that
he
is
looking
after
you
in
whatever
way
is
best
for
you
even
if
you
ca
recognize
it
now
have
you
forgotten
this
can
you
tell
me
your
favorite
verse
in
it
oh
yes
i
can
said
leonore
it
is
the
verse
god
who
disposest
all
things
well
i
want
but
what
thou
givest
me
oh
how
can
we
thine
acts
foretell
when
thou
art
far
more
wise
than
we
yes
i
always
feel
better
when
i
think
of
that
leonore
added
after
a
time
in
a
totally
changed
voice
it
makes
me
happy
because
i
know
that
god
can
do
for
us
what
salo
and
i
ca
do
for
ourselves
but
when
everything
stays
the
same
for
so
long
and
there
is
no
prospect
of
any
change
it
is
so
hard
to
keep
this
faith
if
we
ca
do
anything
for
ourselves
it
seems
as
if
everything
would
have
to
be
that
way
the
woman
said
that
if
anybody
is
homeless
once
he
has
to
remain
that
way
for
the
rest
of
his
life
no
no
leonore
maxa
answered
you
must
not
take
a
chance
word
seriously
the
poor
woman
only
said
it
because
she
saw
no
immediate
help
for
her
children
it
is
not
true
at
all
of
course
you
ca
look
ahead
into
your
future
but
you
can
ask
god
to
give
you
full
confidence
in
him
then
you
can
leave
it
all
to
him
and
the
sense
of
his
protection
will
make
you
calmer
it
will
also
keep
you
from
making
uncertain
plans
which
might
only
bring
fresh
disappointments
leonore
had
attentively
followed
every
word
maxa
had
uttered
looking
thoughtfully
in
front
of
her
for
a
moment
she
said
aunt
maxa
this
was
the
mode
of
address
she
had
long
ago
been
granted
you
want
me
to
think
of
apollonie
cottage
either
shall
we
have
a
disappointment
if
i
hope
that
we
can
find
a
home
there
yes
my
dear
child
it
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
for
you
and
your
brother
to
live
there
i
should
not
tell
you
this
if
i
were
not
absolutely
certain
and
you
can
imagine
that
i
should
not
shatter
such
a
hope
if
i
did
not
have
to
it
hurt
maxa
very
much
to
say
this
but
she
found
it
necessary
she
knew
that
apollonie
in
her
measureless
love
and
admiration
would
never
be
able
to
refuse
a
single
one
of
leonore
wishes
even
if
it
meant
the
impossible
i
shall
not
think
about
it
any
more
then
said
leonore
embracing
maxa
with
utter
confidence
and
i
shall
be
glad
now
that
i
can
still
remain
with
you
later
that
evening
when
the
children
were
all
together
and
leonore
had
conquered
her
grief
for
that
day
a
letter
came
for
their
mother
from
hanover
she
had
informed
the
ladies
of
leonore
complete
recovery
and
had
added
that
the
doctor
thought
it
necessary
for
the
child
to
enjoy
the
strengthening
mountain
air
for
a
while
longer
she
herself
had
no
other
wish
than
to
keep
leonore
in
her
house
as
long
as
possible
the
answer
was
full
of
warm
thanks
for
her
great
help
in
their
embarrassing
situation
they
were
very
glad
to
accept
her
great
kindness
for
two
more
weeks
after
which
one
of
them
would
come
to
fetch
leonore
home
maxa
glanced
with
a
heavy
heart
at
the
child
to
whom
she
had
grown
as
devoted
as
to
her
own
she
felt
dreadfully
sad
at
the
thought
of
letting
her
go
away
so
soon
the
worst
of
it
was
that
she
knew
the
ladies
abode
had
never
really
meant
a
home
for
poor
leonore
it
only
doubled
her
grief
to
know
how
hard
it
would
be
for
the
child
to
leave
her
but
as
she
had
no
right
over
her
she
could
do
nothing
the
only
thing
she
could
plan
was
to
ask
the
ladies
to
let
her
have
leonore
sometimes
during
the
summer
holidays
she
decided
not
to
dampen
the
children
good
spirits
that
evening
with
the
discouraging
news
in
the
letter
chapter
viii
mäzli
pays
visits
whenever
mäzli
found
the
time
heavy
on
her
hands
she
would
suddenly
remember
people
who
might
want
to
see
her
she
had
been
extremely
occupied
all
these
days
entertaining
leonore
as
during
school
hours
she
had
been
the
older
girl
sole
companion
her
brothers
and
sisters
were
now
home
for
a
holiday
and
constantly
surrounded
leonore
finding
herself
without
her
usual
employment
mäzli
ran
after
her
mother
on
the
morning
of
the
holiday
and
kept
on
saying
i
must
go
to
see
apollonie
i
am
sure
loneli
is
sad
that
i
have
not
been
to
see
her
so
long
until
her
mother
finally
gave
her
permission
to
go
that
afternoon
on
her
way
to
apollonie
mäzli
had
been
struck
by
an
idea
which
occupied
her
very
much
she
arrived
at
the
cottage
of
her
old
friend
and
sat
down
beside
loneli
who
was
not
in
the
least
sad
but
looked
about
her
with
the
merriest
eyes
i
must
go
see
the
she
said
quickly
i
promised
it
but
i
forgot
about
it
no
no
mäzli
apollonie
said
evasively
we
have
lots
of
other
things
to
do
we
have
to
see
if
the
plums
are
getting
ripe
on
the
tree
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
and
after
that
you
must
see
the
chickens
just
think
mäzli
they
have
little
chicks
and
you
will
have
to
see
them
i
am
sure
you
wo
ever
want
to
leave
them
oh
yes
when
i
have
seen
them
i
must
go
to
the
because
i
promised
to
mäzli
replied
i
am
sure
he
has
forgotten
all
about
it
and
does
not
remember
you
any
more
apollonie
said
trying
to
ward
mäzli
off
from
her
design
does
your
mama
know
that
you
mean
to
go
to
the
castle
no
because
i
only
thought
of
it
on
my
way
here
mäzli
assured
her
old
friend
but
one
must
always
keep
a
promise
kurt
told
me
that
trius
wo
even
let
you
in
apollonie
protested
certainly
he
has
to
i
know
the
well
and
he
is
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
trius
i
have
noticed
that
said
mäzli
firmly
holding
to
her
resolution
apollonie
realized
that
words
would
do
no
good
and
resolved
to
entertain
mäzli
so
well
with
the
little
chickens
and
other
things
that
it
would
finally
be
too
late
for
her
to
go
to
the
castle
mäzli
inspected
the
tiny
chickens
and
the
ripening
plums
with
great
enjoyment
but
as
this
had
barely
taken
any
time
at
all
she
soon
said
resolutely
i
have
to
go
now
because
it
is
late
if
you
would
like
to
stay
home
loneli
can
come
with
me
i
am
sure
we
can
easily
find
the
way
what
are
you
dreaming
of
mäzli
apollonie
cried
out
how
do
you
think
trius
would
receive
you
if
you
ask
him
to
let
you
in
i
should
like
to
know
you
find
out
something
you
wo
like
i
am
afraid
no
no
this
ca
be
if
you
insist
on
going
i
had
better
go
along
apollonie
went
indoors
to
get
ready
for
the
walk
as
she
always
put
on
better
clothes
whenever
she
mounted
to
the
castle
despite
the
fact
that
she
might
not
see
anyone
loneli
was
extremely
eager
to
have
a
chance
to
find
out
who
was
the
whom
mäzli
had
promised
to
visit
she
had
tried
to
persuade
her
grandmother
to
let
her
go
with
mäzli
in
which
case
her
mother
would
not
need
to
change
her
clothes
but
the
latter
would
not
even
hear
of
it
remarking
you
can
sit
on
the
bench
under
the
pear
tree
with
your
knitting
in
the
meantime
and
you
can
sing
a
song
we
are
sure
to
be
back
again
in
a
little
while
soon
they
started
off
apollonie
firmly
holding
mäzli
hand
trius
appeared
at
the
door
before
they
even
had
time
to
ring
it
seemed
as
if
the
man
really
had
his
eyes
on
everything
throwing
a
furious
glance
at
mäzli
he
opened
the
door
before
apollonie
had
said
a
word
but
he
had
taken
great
care
to
leave
a
crack
which
would
only
allow
a
little
person
like
mäzli
to
slip
through
without
sticking
fast
in
the
opening
mäzli
wriggled
through
and
started
to
run
away
the
next
moment
the
door
was
closed
again
do
you
think
i
intend
to
squeeze
myself
through
too
you
do
not
need
to
bolt
it
trius
apollonie
said
much
offended
it
is
not
necessary
to
cut
off
the
child
from
me
like
that
so
that
i
even
know
where
she
is
going
i
am
taking
care
of
her
remember
you
please
let
me
in
for
i
want
to
watch
her
that
is
all
forbidden
said
trius
why
did
you
let
the
child
in
i
was
ordered
to
what
you
were
ordered
to
by
the
master
cried
out
apollonie
oh
trius
how
could
he
let
the
child
go
in
and
walk
about
the
garden
while
his
old
servant
is
kept
out
she
ought
to
be
in
there
looking
after
things
i
am
sure
you
have
never
told
him
how
i
have
come
to
you
come
again
and
again
and
have
begged
you
to
admit
me
i
want
to
put
things
into
their
old
order
and
you
do
want
me
to
you
do
even
know
apparently
which
bed
he
has
and
if
his
pillows
are
properly
covered
you
said
so
yourself
i
am
sure
that
the
good
old
baroness
would
have
no
peace
in
her
grave
if
she
knew
all
this
and
this
is
all
your
fault
i
can
clearly
see
that
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
though
if
you
refuse
to
give
my
messages
to
the
master
as
i
have
begged
and
begged
you
to
so
often
i
find
another
way
i
write
a
letter
wo
help
what
wo
help
how
can
you
know
that
you
wo
know
what
in
the
letter
i
suppose
the
baron
still
reads
his
own
letters
apollonie
eagerly
went
on
he
receives
no
letters
from
these
parts
this
was
a
terrible
blow
for
apollonie
to
whom
this
new
thought
had
given
great
confidence
she
therefore
decided
to
say
nothing
more
and
quietly
watched
trius
as
he
walked
up
and
down
inside
the
garden
mäzli
in
the
meantime
had
eagerly
pursued
her
way
and
was
soon
up
on
the
terrace
glancing
about
from
there
she
saw
the
gentleman
again
stretched
out
in
the
shadow
of
the
pine
tree
as
she
had
seen
him
first
and
the
glinting
cover
was
lying
again
on
his
knees
mäzli
ran
over
to
him
how
do
you
do
are
you
angry
with
me
because
i
have
not
come
for
so
long
she
called
out
to
him
from
a
distance
and
a
moment
later
she
was
by
his
side
it
was
only
on
account
of
leonore
mäzli
continued
i
should
otherwise
have
come
ages
ago
but
when
the
others
are
all
in
school
she
ca
be
left
alone
so
i
stay
with
her
and
i
like
to
do
it
because
she
is
so
nice
everybody
likes
leonore
everybody
likes
her
terribly
kurt
and
bruno
too
they
stay
home
all
the
time
now
because
leonore
is
with
us
you
ought
to
know
how
nice
she
is
you
would
like
her
dreadfully
right
away
do
you
think
so
said
the
gentleman
while
something
like
a
smile
played
about
his
lips
is
it
your
sister
my
sister
no
indeed
mäzli
said
quite
astonished
at
his
error
she
is
salo
sister
the
boy
who
was
with
us
and
who
had
to
go
back
to
hanover
she
has
to
go
back
to
hanover
too
as
soon
as
she
is
well
and
mama
always
gets
very
sad
when
she
talks
about
it
but
mea
gets
sadder
still
and
even
cries
leonore
hates
to
leave
us
but
she
has
to
she
cried
dreadfully
once
because
she
can
never
never
have
a
home
as
long
as
she
lives
she
have
to
be
homeless
the
who
came
with
the
two
ragged
children
said
that
they
were
homeless
and
leonore
said
afterwards
am
that
way
too
and
then
she
cried
terribly
and
we
were
sent
out
into
the
garden
she
might
have
cried
still
more
if
she
had
thought
about
our
having
a
home
with
a
mama
while
she
has
none
she
has
no
papa
or
anybody
but
you
must
not
think
that
she
is
a
homeless
child
with
a
torn
dress
she
looks
quite
different
maybe
she
can
find
a
home
in
apollonie
little
house
under
the
hill
then
salo
can
come
home
to
her
in
the
holidays
but
mama
does
not
think
that
this
can
be
but
leonore
wants
it
ever
so
much
i
must
bring
her
to
you
one
day
who
are
you
child
what
is
your
name
asked
the
gentleman
abruptly
mäzli
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
i
am
mäzli
she
said
and
mama
has
the
same
name
as
i
have
but
they
do
call
her
that
some
people
call
her
rector
some
mama
and
uncle
philip
says
maxa
to
her
and
leonore
calls
her
aunt
maxa
is
your
father
the
rector
of
nolla
the
gentleman
asked
he
has
been
in
heaven
a
long
while
and
he
was
in
heaven
before
we
came
here
but
mama
wanted
to
come
back
to
nolla
because
this
was
her
home
we
do
live
in
the
rectory
now
but
where
there
is
a
garden
with
lots
of
paths
and
where
the
big
are
in
the
corners
here
and
here
and
here
mäzli
traced
the
position
of
the
bushes
exactly
on
the
lionskin
the
leaning
back
in
his
chair
said
nothing
more
do
you
find
it
very
tiresome
here
mäzli
asked
sympathetically
yes
i
do
was
the
answer
have
you
no
no
oh
i
bring
you
one
as
soon
as
i
come
again
and
then
but
perhaps
you
have
a
headache
mäzli
interrupted
herself
when
my
mama
wrinkles
up
her
forehead
the
way
you
do
she
always
has
a
headache
and
one
must
get
her
some
cold
water
to
make
it
better
i
quickly
get
some
and
the
next
instant
mäzli
was
gone
come
back
child
the
gentleman
called
after
her
there
is
nobody
in
the
castle
and
you
wo
find
any
it
seemed
strange
to
mäzli
that
there
should
be
nobody
to
bring
water
to
the
i
find
somebody
for
him
she
said
eagerly
running
down
the
incline
to
the
door
in
whose
vicinity
trius
was
wandering
up
and
down
you
are
to
go
up
to
the
at
once
she
said
standing
still
in
front
of
him
and
you
are
to
bring
him
some
cold
water
because
he
has
a
headache
but
very
quickly
trius
glanced
at
mäzli
in
an
infuriated
way
as
if
to
say
how
do
you
dare
to
come
to
me
like
this
then
throwing
the
door
wide
open
he
growled
like
a
cross
bear
out
of
here
first
so
i
can
close
it
after
mäzli
had
slipped
out
he
banged
the
big
door
with
all
his
might
so
that
the
hinges
rattled
turning
the
monstrous
key
twice
in
the
lock
he
also
bolted
it
with
a
vengeance
by
this
he
meant
to
show
that
no
one
could
easily
go
in
again
at
his
pleasure
apollonie
who
had
been
sitting
down
in
the
shade
not
far
from
the
door
now
went
up
to
mäzli
and
said
you
stayed
there
a
long
time
what
did
the
gentleman
say
very
little
but
i
told
him
a
lot
mäzli
said
he
has
a
headache
apollonie
and
just
think
nobody
ever
brings
him
any
water
and
trius
even
turns
the
key
and
bolts
the
door
before
he
goes
to
him
apollonie
broke
out
into
such
lamentations
and
complaints
after
these
words
that
mäzli
could
not
bear
it
but
he
has
the
water
long
ago
apollonie
i
am
sure
trius
gave
it
to
him
please
do
go
on
so
she
said
a
trifle
impatiently
but
this
was
only
oil
poured
on
the
flames
yes
no
one
knows
what
he
does
and
what
he
does
do
apollonie
lamented
louder
than
ever
the
poor
master
is
sick
and
all
his
servant
does
is
to
stumble
about
the
place
not
asking
after
his
needs
and
letting
everything
go
to
rack
and
ruin
not
a
or
a
is
to
be
seen
not
one
strawberry
or
raspberry
no
golden
apricots
on
the
wall
or
a
single
little
dainty
peach
the
disorder
everywhere
is
frightful
when
i
think
how
wonderfully
it
used
to
be
managed
by
the
baroness
apollonie
kept
on
wiping
her
eyes
because
present
conditions
worried
her
dreadfully
you
ca
understand
it
mäzli
she
continued
when
she
had
calmed
down
a
trifle
you
see
child
i
should
be
glad
to
give
a
finger
of
my
right
hand
if
i
could
go
up
there
one
day
a
week
in
order
to
arrange
things
for
the
master
as
they
should
be
and
fix
the
garden
and
the
vegetables
the
stuff
the
old
soldier
is
giving
him
to
eat
is
perfectly
horrid
i
know
mäzli
hated
to
hear
complaints
so
she
always
looked
for
a
remedy
you
do
need
to
be
so
unhappy
she
said
just
cook
some
nice
for
him
and
i
take
it
up
to
him
then
he
have
something
good
to
eat
something
much
better
than
vegetables
oh
yes
a
thousand
times
better
you
little
innocent
oh
when
i
think
of
forty
years
ago
apollonie
cried
out
but
she
complained
no
further
mäzli
answers
had
clearly
given
her
the
conviction
that
the
child
could
not
possibly
understand
the
difficult
situation
she
was
in
mäzli
chattered
gaily
by
apollonie
side
and
as
soon
as
she
reached
home
wanted
to
tell
her
mother
what
had
happened
but
the
child
was
to
have
no
opportunity
for
that
day
the
mother
had
been
very
careful
in
keeping
the
contents
of
miss
remke
letter
from
the
children
in
order
not
to
spoil
their
last
two
weeks
together
unfortunately
bruno
had
that
day
received
a
letter
from
salo
in
which
he
wrote
that
in
ten
days
one
of
the
ladies
was
coming
to
fetch
leonore
home
as
she
was
completely
well
salo
remarked
quite
frankly
that
he
himself
hardly
looked
forward
to
leonore
coming
as
he
saw
in
each
of
her
letters
how
happy
she
was
in
aunt
maxa
household
and
how
difficult
the
separation
would
be
for
her
whenever
he
thought
how
hard
it
would
be
for
her
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
change
again
all
his
joy
vanished
at
the
prospect
of
her
return
bruno
had
read
the
whole
letter
aloud
and
had
therewith
conjured
up
such
consternation
and
grief
on
every
side
that
the
mother
hardly
knew
how
to
comfort
them
leonore
herself
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
excited
group
she
gave
no
sound
and
had
unsuccessfully
tried
to
swallow
her
rising
tears
but
they
had
got
the
better
of
her
and
were
falling
over
her
cheeks
in
a
steady
stream
mea
was
crying
excitedly
oh
mother
you
must
help
us
you
have
to
write
to
the
ladies
that
they
must
come
please
do
let
leonore
go
bruno
remarked
passionately
that
no
one
had
the
right
to
drag
a
sick
person
on
a
journey
against
the
doctor
wishes
the
doctor
had
said
the
last
time
he
had
been
here
that
leonore
was
to
have
not
less
than
a
month
for
her
complete
recovery
kurt
cried
out
over
and
over
again
oh
mother
it
cruel
perfectly
cruel
we
all
want
to
keep
her
here
and
she
wants
to
stay
now
she
is
to
be
violently
taken
from
us
is
that
absolutely
cruel
lippo
coming
close
to
leonore
also
did
his
best
to
console
her
he
remembered
that
he
could
not
say
stay
with
us
any
more
but
he
had
another
plan
do
cry
leonore
he
said
encouragingly
as
soon
as
i
am
big
uncle
philip
has
promised
to
give
me
a
house
and
a
lot
of
meadows
i
be
a
farmer
then
and
i
write
to
you
to
come
to
live
with
me
and
salo
can
come
for
the
holidays
too
leonore
could
not
help
smiling
but
it
only
brought
more
tears
when
she
thought
how
much
love
she
was
receiving
from
all
these
children
and
that
she
had
to
leave
them
and
might
never
see
them
again
the
attempts
to
comfort
them
failed
entirely
because
she
had
no
hope
herself
in
the
middle
of
this
agitating
scene
mäzli
arrived
perfectly
happy
and
filled
with
her
recent
experiences
she
wished
to
relate
what
the
had
said
to
her
and
what
she
had
said
to
him
and
what
had
happened
afterwards
but
no
one
listened
because
they
were
so
deeply
absorbed
with
their
own
disturbing
thoughts
they
were
not
in
the
least
interested
in
what
mäzli
had
to
say
about
the
steward
as
they
all
thought
that
the
steward
was
trius
that
evening
the
happened
mäzli
actually
begged
to
go
to
bed
before
the
evening
song
had
been
sung
because
the
depressing
atmosphere
in
the
house
was
so
little
to
her
taste
that
she
even
preferred
to
go
to
bed
mea
had
been
hoping
till
now
that
her
mother
would
find
some
means
to
keep
leonore
if
it
could
not
be
the
way
apollonie
planned
she
might
at
least
stay
for
a
long
stretch
of
time
all
of
a
sudden
this
hope
was
gone
entirely
and
the
day
of
separation
was
terribly
near
the
girl
looked
so
completely
miserable
when
she
started
out
for
school
next
day
that
the
mother
had
not
the
heart
to
let
her
go
without
a
little
comfort
you
only
need
to
go
to
school
two
more
days
mea
she
said
next
week
you
can
stay
home
and
spend
all
your
time
with
leonore
mea
was
very
glad
to
hear
it
but
without
uttering
a
word
she
ran
away
for
everything
that
concerned
leonore
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
leonore
had
been
looking
so
pale
the
last
few
days
that
maxa
surveyed
her
anxiously
perhaps
the
recovery
had
not
been
as
complete
as
they
had
hoped
for
the
news
of
the
close
date
of
her
departure
had
proved
to
be
a
great
strain
for
her
maxa
went
about
quite
downcast
and
silent
herself
nothing
for
a
long
time
had
been
so
hard
for
her
to
bear
as
the
thought
of
separation
from
the
little
girl
she
had
begun
to
love
like
one
of
her
own
who
had
also
grown
so
lovingly
attached
to
her
the
pressure
lay
on
them
all
very
heavily
bruno
never
said
a
word
kurt
standing
in
a
corner
with
a
was
busily
scribbling
down
his
melancholy
thoughts
but
he
did
not
show
his
verses
to
anyone
as
the
tragic
feeling
in
them
might
have
drawn
remarks
from
bruno
which
he
might
not
have
been
able
to
endure
lippo
faithfully
followed
leonore
wherever
she
went
and
from
time
to
time
repeated
his
consoling
words
but
he
said
them
in
such
a
wailing
voice
that
they
sounded
extremely
doleful
mäzli
alone
still
gazed
about
her
with
merry
eyes
and
was
dancing
with
joy
when
she
saw
that
it
was
a
bright
sunny
day
you
can
take
a
little
walk
with
leonore
mäzli
the
mother
said
immediately
after
lunch
as
soon
as
the
other
children
had
started
off
to
school
leonore
will
grow
too
pale
if
she
does
not
get
into
the
open
air
take
her
on
a
pretty
walk
mäzli
you
might
go
to
apollonie
mäzli
most
willingly
got
her
little
hat
and
the
children
set
out
when
they
had
passed
across
the
garden
mäzli
suddenly
stood
still
oh
i
forgot
something
she
said
i
have
to
go
back
again
please
wait
for
me
i
wo
be
long
mäzli
disappeared
but
came
back
very
shortly
with
a
large
under
each
arm
they
were
the
biggest
she
had
found
and
she
had
chosen
them
because
she
thought
the
bigger
the
books
the
bigger
his
delight
at
looking
at
them
now
i
tell
you
what
i
thought
she
said
on
reaching
leonore
you
see
up
in
the
castle
under
a
big
tree
sits
the
sick
i
promised
to
go
to
see
him
soon
again
and
to
bring
him
a
picture
book
but
i
am
bringing
him
two
because
he
like
two
better
i
also
promised
to
bring
you
and
something
else
besides
you
do
know
why
he
needs
that
other
thing
but
you
will
hear
when
we
are
up
there
let
us
go
now
but
mäzli
i
do
know
the
gentleman
and
he
does
know
me
leonore
began
to
object
i
ca
go
because
he
might
not
like
it
besides
your
mother
knows
nothing
about
it
but
mäzli
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
giving
up
her
expedition
i
have
everything
i
want
to
bring
him
now
and
the
has
probably
been
waiting
for
us
all
day
so
you
see
we
simply
must
go
mama
also
says
that
one
has
to
go
to
see
sick
people
and
bring
them
things
because
it
cheers
them
up
he
has
to
sit
all
day
alone
under
the
tree
and
he
gets
dreadfully
tired
when
he
has
a
headache
not
a
person
comes
to
bring
him
anything
it
is
not
nice
of
you
not
to
want
to
go
when
he
is
expecting
us
mäzli
had
talked
so
eagerly
that
she
not
only
became
absolutely
convinced
herself
that
it
would
be
the
greatest
wrong
if
she
did
not
go
to
see
the
but
produced
a
similar
feeling
in
leonore
i
shall
gladly
go
with
you
if
you
think
the
sick
gentleman
does
not
object
she
said
i
only
did
know
whether
he
would
want
us
mäzli
was
satisfied
now
and
gaily
talking
led
leonore
toward
the
lofty
iron
door
the
path
led
up
between
fragrant
meadows
and
heavily
laden
apple
trees
and
when
they
reached
their
destination
they
found
it
quite
superfluous
to
ring
the
bell
trius
had
long
ago
observed
them
and
stood
immovably
behind
the
door
hoping
that
he
would
open
it
the
children
waited
expectantly
but
he
did
not
budge
we
want
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
said
mäzli
better
open
soon
not
for
two
was
the
answer
certainly
we
both
have
to
go
in
because
he
is
expecting
us
mäzli
informed
him
i
promised
to
bring
leonore
so
you
better
open
but
trius
did
not
stir
come
mäzli
we
better
go
back
said
leonore
in
a
low
voice
you
see
that
he
wo
open
it
maybe
he
is
not
allowed
but
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
turn
mäzli
from
her
project
if
he
wo
open
it
i
scream
so
loud
that
the
will
hear
it
she
said
obstinately
he
is
sure
to
say
something
then
for
he
is
waiting
for
us
i
can
shout
very
loud
just
listen
her
cry
was
so
vigorous
that
trius
became
quite
blue
with
rage
be
quiet
you
little
monster
he
said
but
he
opened
the
door
nevertheless
maybe
we
should
go
in
said
leonore
mäzli
pulled
her
along
however
and
never
let
go
her
hand
till
they
had
reached
the
terrace
she
had
no
desire
to
leave
her
friend
behind
when
they
were
so
near
their
goal
now
mäzli
quickly
taking
back
the
second
which
leonore
had
been
carrying
for
her
began
to
run
just
come
leonore
look
there
he
sits
already
with
this
mäzli
flew
over
to
the
large
pine
tree
how
do
you
do
did
i
come
soon
again
this
time
she
merrily
called
out
to
him
i
have
also
brought
everything
i
promised
here
are
the
picture
books
look
two
of
them
i
thought
you
might
look
through
one
too
quickly
mäzli
laid
both
books
on
the
lion
skin
and
began
to
rummage
through
her
pockets
look
what
else
i
brought
you
and
mäzli
laid
down
a
tiny
ivory
whistle
kurt
gave
it
to
me
once
and
now
i
give
it
to
you
if
you
have
a
headache
and
trius
is
far
away
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
whistle
then
he
can
come
and
bring
you
some
water
he
hear
it
far
far
away
because
it
whistles
as
loud
as
anything
just
try
it
once
i
have
also
brought
you
leonore
the
gentleman
started
slightly
and
looked
up
leonore
had
shyly
retreated
behind
the
chair
but
mäzli
pulled
her
forward
the
gentleman
now
threw
a
penetrating
glance
at
the
delicate
looking
little
girl
who
hardly
dared
to
raise
her
large
dark
eyes
to
his
leonore
who
had
blushed
violently
under
his
scrutiny
said
in
a
barely
audible
voice
perhaps
we
should
not
have
come
but
mäzli
thought
we
might
be
allowed
to
see
you
can
we
do
something
for
you
perhaps
mäzli
should
not
have
brought
me
oh
i
am
so
sorry
if
i
have
offended
you
no
indeed
mäzli
meant
well
when
she
wanted
me
to
meet
her
friend
the
gentleman
said
in
quite
a
friendly
voice
what
is
the
name
of
mäzli
friend
leonore
von
wallerstätten
the
girl
answered
and
noticing
the
large
books
on
the
gentleman
knees
she
added
may
i
take
the
books
away
they
might
be
too
heavy
yes
you
might
but
it
was
very
good
of
mäzli
to
bring
them
all
the
way
up
to
me
he
said
i
look
at
them
a
little
later
may
i
fix
your
pillow
for
you
it
does
not
do
you
much
good
that
way
said
leonore
pulling
it
up
it
had
long
ago
slipped
out
of
position
oh
this
is
better
this
is
lovely
the
sick
man
replied
comfortably
leaning
back
in
the
chair
what
a
shame
it
wo
stay
i
am
afraid
it
is
falling
down
again
said
leonore
regretfully
we
ought
to
have
a
ribbon
if
i
only
had
one
and
a
thread
and
needle
but
perhaps
we
could
come
again
leonore
became
quite
frightened
suddenly
at
her
boldness
and
remained
silent
from
embarrassment
but
mäzli
got
her
out
of
this
trying
situation
full
of
confidence
she
announced
that
they
would
return
the
next
day
with
everything
necessary
the
gentleman
now
asked
leonore
where
she
came
from
and
where
she
lived
she
related
that
she
had
been
living
in
a
boarding
school
for
several
years
ever
since
the
death
of
her
with
whom
both
she
and
her
brother
had
found
a
home
have
you
no
other
relations
the
gentleman
asked
keenly
observing
her
the
while
no
none
at
all
except
an
uncle
who
has
been
living
in
spain
for
many
years
my
aunt
told
us
that
he
wo
ever
come
back
and
that
no
one
knows
where
he
is
if
we
knew
where
he
is
we
should
have
written
to
him
long
ago
salo
would
go
to
spain
as
soon
as
he
was
allowed
to
and
i
should
go
to
him
in
any
case
why
the
gentleman
asked
because
he
is
our
father
brother
she
replied
and
we
could
love
him
like
a
father
too
he
is
the
only
person
in
the
whole
world
to
whom
we
could
belong
we
have
wished
many
and
many
a
time
a
chance
to
look
for
him
because
we
might
live
with
him
no
you
could
do
that
i
know
him
i
have
been
in
spain
the
said
curtly
a
light
spread
over
leonore
face
as
if
her
heart
had
been
suddenly
flooded
with
hope
oh
do
you
really
know
our
uncle
do
you
know
where
he
is
living
she
cried
out
while
her
cheeks
flushed
with
happiness
oh
please
tell
me
what
you
know
about
him
when
she
gazed
up
at
the
gentleman
with
such
sparkling
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
ought
to
consider
his
reply
carefully
suddenly
he
said
positively
no
no
you
can
never
seek
him
out
your
uncle
is
an
old
sick
man
and
no
young
people
could
possibly
live
with
him
he
must
remain
alone
in
his
old
owl
nest
you
could
not
go
to
him
there
but
we
should
go
to
him
so
much
more
if
he
is
old
and
ill
he
needs
us
more
then
than
if
he
had
a
family
leonore
said
eagerly
he
could
be
our
father
and
we
his
children
and
we
could
take
care
of
him
and
love
him
if
he
only
were
not
so
dreadfully
far
away
if
you
could
only
tell
us
where
he
lives
we
could
write
to
him
and
get
his
permission
to
go
there
without
him
we
ca
do
anything
at
all
because
von
stiele
in
hanover
wants
salo
to
study
for
years
and
years
longer
we
have
to
do
everything
he
says
unless
our
uncle
should
call
us
oh
please
tell
me
where
he
lives
just
think
of
all
the
deprivations
you
would
have
to
suffer
with
your
old
uncle
think
how
lonely
it
would
be
for
you
to
live
with
a
sick
man
in
a
wild
nest
among
the
rocks
what
do
you
say
to
that
he
said
curtly
oh
it
would
only
be
glorious
for
salo
and
me
to
have
a
real
home
with
an
uncle
we
loved
leonore
continued
showing
that
her
longing
could
not
be
quenched
there
is
only
one
thing
i
should
miss
there
but
i
have
to
miss
it
in
hanover
too
i
shall
never
never
feel
at
home
there
well
what
is
this
the
gentleman
queried
that
i
ca
be
together
with
aunt
maxa
and
the
children
shall
we
ask
aunt
maxa
advice
would
this
suit
you
child
oh
yes
indeed
leonore
answered
happily
at
the
mention
of
aunt
maxa
she
suddenly
remembered
that
they
had
not
told
her
where
they
were
going
as
she
was
afraid
that
they
had
remained
away
too
long
already
lenore
urged
mäzli
to
take
her
leave
quickly
while
she
gave
her
hand
to
the
steward
will
you
deliver
a
message
for
me
leonore
he
said
will
you
tell
your
aunt
maxa
that
the
master
of
the
castle
whom
she
knew
long
years
ago
would
love
to
visit
her
but
he
is
unable
ask
her
if
he
may
hope
that
she
will
come
up
to
him
at
the
castle
instead
mäzli
gave
her
hand
now
to
say
and
when
she
noticed
that
the
pillow
had
slipped
down
again
she
said
apollonie
would
just
love
to
set
things
in
order
for
you
but
trius
wo
let
her
in
she
would
be
willing
to
give
a
finger
from
her
right
hand
if
she
were
allowed
to
do
everything
trius
does
do
come
now
mäzli
said
leonore
for
she
had
the
feeling
that
this
peculiar
revelation
might
be
followed
by
others
as
unintelligible
but
the
smiled
as
if
he
had
comprehended
mäzli
words
maxa
was
standing
in
front
of
her
house
surrounded
by
her
children
anxiously
looking
for
the
two
missing
ones
nobody
could
understand
where
leonore
and
mäzli
might
have
stayed
so
long
suddenly
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
blue
ribbons
fluttering
from
leonore
hat
quickly
the
children
rushed
to
meet
them
where
do
you
come
from
where
did
you
stay
so
long
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
sounded
from
all
sides
in
the
castle
was
the
answer
the
excitement
only
grew
at
this
how
could
you
get
there
who
opened
the
door
what
did
you
do
at
the
castle
the
questions
were
poured
out
at
such
a
rate
that
no
answer
could
possibly
have
been
heard
i
went
to
see
the
before
i
have
been
to
see
him
quite
often
said
mäzli
loudly
for
she
was
desirous
of
being
heard
leonore
had
gone
ahead
with
the
mother
arm
linked
in
hers
for
she
was
very
anxious
to
deliver
her
message
kurt
was
too
much
interested
in
mäzli
expedition
to
the
castle
to
be
frightened
off
by
the
first
unintelligible
account
he
had
to
find
out
how
it
had
come
about
and
what
had
happened
but
the
two
did
not
get
very
far
in
their
dialogue
as
soon
as
mäzli
began
to
talk
first
about
trius
and
then
about
the
steward
kurt
always
said
quickly
but
this
is
all
one
and
the
same
person
do
make
two
out
of
them
mäzli
all
the
world
knows
that
trius
is
the
steward
of
castle
wildenstein
he
is
one
person
and
not
two
then
mäzli
answered
trius
is
one
and
the
is
another
they
are
two
people
and
not
one
after
they
had
repeated
this
about
three
times
bruno
said
oh
kurt
leave
her
alone
mäzli
thinks
that
there
are
two
when
she
calls
him
first
trius
and
then
mr
that
was
too
much
for
mäzli
and
shouting
vigorously
they
are
two
people
they
are
two
people
she
ran
away
leonore
had
related
in
the
meantime
how
mäzli
had
proposed
to
visit
the
sick
and
how
she
had
at
first
been
reluctant
to
go
till
mäzli
had
made
her
feel
that
she
was
wrong
she
related
everything
that
had
happened
and
all
the
questions
he
had
asked
her
just
think
aunt
maxa
leonore
went
on
the
gentleman
knows
our
uncle
in
spain
he
said
that
he
had
been
there
too
and
he
knows
that
our
uncle
is
old
and
ill
and
is
living
all
by
himself
i
wanted
so
much
to
find
out
where
he
was
and
asked
him
to
tell
me
but
he
thought
it
would
not
help
as
we
could
possibly
go
to
him
so
i
said
that
we
might
write
and
just
think
aunt
maxa
at
last
he
said
he
would
ask
your
advice
then
leonore
gave
her
message
he
did
not
say
that
the
as
he
called
himself
to
mäzli
sent
the
message
but
told
me
that
it
was
from
the
master
of
the
castle
whom
you
knew
a
long
time
ago
leonore
concluded
oh
just
think
aunt
maxa
we
might
find
our
uncle
after
all
oh
please
help
us
for
i
want
so
much
to
write
to
him
maxa
had
listened
with
agitation
and
she
was
so
deeply
affected
that
she
could
not
say
a
word
she
could
not
express
the
thought
which
thrilled
her
so
because
she
did
not
know
the
intentions
mea
loud
complaints
at
this
moment
conveniently
hid
her
mother
silence
oh
leonore
she
cried
out
if
you
go
to
spain
we
sha
see
each
other
again
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
then
you
will
never
never
come
back
here
any
more
do
you
really
think
so
leonore
asked
much
downcast
she
felt
that
it
would
be
hard
for
her
to
choose
in
such
a
case
and
she
suddenly
did
not
know
if
she
really
wanted
to
go
to
spain
it
is
not
very
easy
to
make
a
trip
to
spain
children
said
the
mother
and
i
am
sure
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
excited
about
it
when
kurt
after
the
belated
supper
that
night
renewed
his
examination
about
the
single
or
the
double
steward
of
castle
wildenstein
their
mother
announced
that
bedtime
had
not
only
come
for
the
little
ones
but
for
all
soon
after
the
whole
lively
party
was
sleeping
soundly
and
only
the
mother
was
still
sitting
in
her
room
sunk
in
deep
meditation
she
had
not
been
able
to
think
over
the
baron
words
till
now
and
she
wondered
what
hopes
she
might
build
upon
them
he
might
only
want
to
talk
over
leonore
situation
because
he
had
realized
how
little
she
felt
at
home
in
hanover
but
all
this
thinking
led
to
nothing
and
she
knew
that
our
good
lord
in
heaven
who
opens
doors
which
seem
most
tightly
barred
had
let
it
happen
for
a
purpose
she
was
so
grateful
that
she
would
be
able
to
see
the
person
who
more
than
anyone
else
held
leonore
destiny
in
his
hands
full
of
confidence
in
god
she
hoped
that
the
hand
which
had
opened
an
impassable
road
would
also
lead
an
embittered
heart
back
to
himself
and
by
renewing
in
him
the
love
of
his
fellowmen
bring
about
much
happiness
and
joy
chapter
ix
in
the
castle
the
next
afternoon
after
planning
a
pleasant
walk
for
leonore
and
mäzli
maxa
started
on
her
way
to
the
castle
as
soon
as
she
neared
the
grated
iron
door
it
opened
wide
and
holding
his
hat
in
his
hand
trius
stood
deeply
bowing
in
the
opening
may
i
see
the
baron
asked
maxa
after
another
reverence
trius
led
the
visitor
up
the
hill
and
when
he
had
duly
announced
her
invited
her
with
a
third
bow
to
step
forward
it
was
quite
evident
that
trius
had
been
definitely
ordered
to
change
his
usual
mode
of
behaviour
maxa
now
approached
the
chair
near
the
pine
tree
have
you
really
come
mrs
maxa
said
the
sick
man
putting
out
his
hand
did
no
bitter
feelings
against
the
keep
you
back
maxa
pressed
the
proffered
hand
and
replied
i
could
wish
for
no
greater
joy
baron
than
to
have
your
door
opened
for
me
i
have
wondered
oftener
than
you
could
think
if
this
would
ever
happen
for
i
wanted
an
opportunity
to
serve
you
i
know
no
bitter
feelings
and
never
have
known
them
everybody
who
has
loved
this
castle
and
its
inmates
has
known
they
suffered
grief
and
pain
i
returned
to
this
old
cave
here
to
die
said
the
baron
you
can
see
plainly
that
i
am
a
broken
man
i
only
wished
to
forget
the
past
in
this
solitude
and
i
thought
it
right
for
me
to
die
forgotten
then
your
little
girl
came
in
here
one
day
i
have
not
been
able
to
discover
how
oh
please
forgive
her
said
maxa
it
is
a
riddle
to
me
too
how
she
succeeded
in
entering
this
garden
i
knew
nothing
about
it
till
yesterday
evening
when
the
children
came
home
from
the
castle
i
am
terribly
afraid
that
mäzli
has
annoyed
you
she
has
not
done
so
at
all
for
she
is
her
mother
true
child
said
the
baron
she
was
so
anxious
to
help
me
and
to
bring
me
what
i
lacked
because
she
loved
leonore
so
much
she
wanted
me
to
know
her
too
but
i
can
not
understand
leonore
she
begged
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
see
her
uncle
as
she
wished
to
live
with
him
and
love
him
like
a
father
she
even
longs
to
seek
him
out
in
a
foreign
country
what
shall
i
do
please
give
me
your
advice
mrs
maxa
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
baron
the
lady
replied
with
an
overflowing
heart
god
himself
has
done
what
we
never
could
have
accomplished
despite
all
our
wishes
the
child
has
been
led
into
your
arms
by
god
and
therefore
belongs
to
you
from
now
on
you
must
become
her
father
and
let
her
love
and
take
care
of
you
you
will
soon
realize
what
a
treasure
she
is
and
through
her
the
good
old
times
will
come
back
to
this
castle
you
will
grow
young
again
yourself
as
soon
as
you
two
are
here
together
the
baron
replied
our
dear
maxa
always
saw
things
in
an
ideal
light
how
could
a
delicate
child
like
leonore
fit
into
a
wilderness
like
this
castle
everything
here
is
deserted
and
forlorn
just
think
of
the
old
watchman
here
and
me
what
miserable
housemates
we
should
be
wo
you
receive
the
child
in
your
house
for
she
clearly
longs
to
have
a
home
i
know
that
she
will
find
one
there
and
apparently
has
found
it
already
she
can
learn
by
and
by
who
her
uncle
is
and
then
she
can
come
to
visit
him
sometimes
amazed
at
this
sudden
change
maxa
was
silent
for
a
while
how
she
would
have
rejoiced
at
this
prospect
a
few
days
ago
i
love
leonore
like
my
own
child
and
wanted
nothing
better
than
to
keep
her
with
me
she
said
finally
but
i
think
differently
now
the
children
belong
to
you
and
the
castle
of
their
fathers
must
become
their
home
you
must
let
leonore
surround
you
with
her
delightful
and
soothing
personality
which
is
sure
to
make
you
happy
when
you
come
to
know
her
you
will
soon
realize
of
what
i
should
have
robbed
you
there
is
no
necessity
at
all
for
the
castle
to
remain
forlorn
and
empty
despite
the
loss
of
our
dear
loved
ones
the
life
here
can
again
become
as
pleasant
as
in
former
times
your
mother
always
hoped
that
this
would
happen
at
her
eldest
son
return
as
she
had
desired
that
his
home
should
remain
unchanged
even
after
her
death
leonore
can
have
her
quarters
in
your
mother
rooms
i
wonder
if
you
would
like
to
see
the
rooms
you
knew
so
well
maxa
the
baron
said
slowly
maxa
gladly
assented
to
this
may
i
go
everywhere
she
asked
i
know
my
way
so
well
certainly
wherever
you
wish
the
baron
replied
entering
the
large
hall
maxa
was
filled
with
deep
emotion
here
she
had
spent
the
most
beautiful
days
of
her
childhood
in
delicious
games
with
the
unforgettable
leonore
and
the
two
young
barons
everything
was
as
it
had
been
then
the
large
stone
table
in
the
middle
the
stone
benches
on
the
walls
and
the
niches
with
the
old
knights
of
wallerstätten
stood
there
as
of
yore
when
she
went
into
the
everything
looked
bare
and
empty
the
portraits
of
ancestors
had
been
taken
from
the
walls
and
the
glinting
pewter
plates
and
goblets
were
gone
from
the
large
oaken
sideboard
maxa
shook
her
head
going
up
the
stairs
she
decided
first
of
all
to
go
to
the
baron
rooms
for
she
wondered
what
care
he
was
receiving
rigid
with
consternation
she
stopped
under
the
doorway
what
a
room
it
was
not
the
tiniest
picture
was
on
the
wall
and
not
a
single
small
rug
lay
on
the
uneven
boards
nothing
but
an
empty
bedstead
an
old
wicker
chair
and
a
table
which
had
plainly
been
dragged
there
from
the
servants
quarters
comprised
the
furniture
maxa
looked
again
to
make
sure
that
it
was
really
the
baron
room
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
it
was
the
balcony
room
in
the
tower
where
did
the
baron
sleep
as
the
sight
proved
more
than
she
could
bear
she
quickly
sought
the
late
baroness
chamber
here
too
everything
was
empty
and
the
red
chairs
and
the
sofa
in
the
corner
over
which
all
the
pictures
of
the
children
used
to
hang
were
gone
only
an
empty
bedstead
stood
in
the
corner
maxa
went
next
to
leonore
room
which
used
to
be
extremely
pretty
lovely
pictures
used
to
hang
on
the
walls
chairs
covered
in
light
blue
silk
were
standing
about
a
bed
was
placed
in
a
corner
and
she
remembered
the
dearest
little
desk
on
which
two
flower
vases
always
filled
with
fresh
roses
used
to
stand
maxa
did
not
even
go
in
this
time
it
was
too
horribly
forlorn
the
only
thing
which
still
spoke
of
old
times
was
the
wallpaper
with
the
tiny
red
and
blue
flowers
she
quickly
went
out
throwing
a
single
glance
at
the
large
she
likened
it
to
a
dreary
desert
not
a
curtain
not
a
chair
or
painting
could
be
seen
where
could
all
the
valuable
furniture
have
gone
to
was
it
possible
that
the
castle
had
been
robbed
and
no
one
knew
of
it
it
was
probable
however
that
trius
did
not
know
about
anything
and
it
was
plain
that
the
baron
himself
had
not
troubled
about
these
things
maxa
hurriedly
went
back
to
him
to
what
a
dreary
home
you
have
come
back
my
poor
friend
she
cried
out
and
i
know
that
your
mother
never
wished
you
to
find
it
like
this
how
unhappy
you
must
have
felt
when
you
entered
these
walls
after
so
many
years
you
can
not
help
feeling
miserable
here
and
it
is
all
quite
incomprehensible
to
me
not
to
me
the
baron
quietly
replied
i
somehow
felt
it
had
to
be
that
way
did
i
value
my
home
before
it
is
a
just
retribution
to
me
to
find
the
place
so
empty
and
forlorn
i
only
returned
to
die
here
and
i
can
await
death
in
daytime
on
my
chair
out
here
and
at
night
time
in
my
nest
i
need
nothing
further
but
death
has
not
come
as
quickly
as
i
thought
it
would
why
are
you
trying
to
bring
me
back
to
life
again
this
is
what
i
decidedly
mean
to
do
so
we
shall
banish
the
subject
of
death
from
now
on
as
i
confidently
believe
that
our
lord
in
heaven
has
other
plans
for
you
maxa
said
decisively
i
can
see
for
myself
that
it
is
better
for
leonore
to
stay
with
us
and
i
am
ever
so
happy
for
your
permission
may
i
write
the
ladies
in
hanover
that
you
do
not
want
leonore
to
be
fetched
away
for
the
present
the
baron
heartily
gave
this
permission
i
have
to
trouble
you
for
one
thing
baron
can
you
remember
apollonie
who
was
for
many
years
your
most
faithful
servant
the
baron
smilingly
answered
of
course
i
remember
her
how
could
i
possibly
forget
apollonie
who
was
always
ready
to
help
us
in
everything
your
little
daughter
has
already
given
me
news
of
her
she
is
the
only
one
who
might
know
what
happened
to
the
furniture
maxa
continued
i
am
going
to
see
her
right
away
and
i
wish
you
would
admit
her
when
she
comes
in
case
the
place
has
really
been
robbed
you
must
let
me
get
what
you
require
nobody
is
looking
after
you
and
you
stand
sorely
in
need
of
good
care
i
am
quite
sure
that
your
mother
would
like
me
to
look
after
you
do
you
not
think
so
i
do
the
baron
replied
smilingly
and
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
be
obedient
after
these
words
maxa
took
her
leave
and
rapidly
walked
down
the
mountain
she
unexpectedly
entered
apollonie
garden
while
the
latter
was
working
there
and
immediately
described
to
her
the
terrible
state
of
things
at
the
castle
she
had
always
believed
that
the
baron
would
find
it
and
furnished
and
now
everything
was
gone
and
he
had
not
even
a
bed
to
sleep
in
but
was
obliged
to
spend
both
day
and
night
in
his
chair
apollonie
had
been
wringing
her
hands
all
the
time
and
broke
out
at
last
bitterly
how
could
i
have
foreseen
that
oh
what
a
turk
what
a
savage
what
an
old
heathen
that
miserable
trius
is
she
sobbed
full
of
rage
and
grief
i
understand
now
why
he
never
answered
my
questions
i
have
asked
him
many
a
time
if
he
had
taken
out
the
right
bed
and
was
using
the
things
belonging
to
it
which
were
marked
with
a
blue
crown
in
the
corners
he
only
used
to
grin
at
me
and
never
said
a
word
he
never
even
looked
for
them
and
calmly
let
my
poor
sick
baron
suffer
nothing
is
missing
not
even
the
tiniest
picture
or
trifle
and
he
had
to
come
back
to
a
terrible
waste
all
my
sleepless
nights
were
not
in
vain
but
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
it
could
be
as
bad
as
that
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
is
my
fault
yes
it
really
is
all
my
fault
maxa
and
apollonie
went
on
to
tell
how
this
had
come
about
baron
bruno
had
only
heard
the
news
of
his
brother
marriage
and
his
mother
death
when
he
returned
the
first
time
years
ago
he
left
again
immediately
and
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
did
not
intend
to
return
for
a
long
while
as
no
one
had
lived
at
the
castle
for
so
long
she
had
decided
to
put
all
the
beautiful
things
safely
away
in
order
to
keep
them
from
ruin
and
possible
thieves
so
she
had
stored
them
in
the
attic
wrapped
in
sheets
and
had
locked
the
place
up
apollonie
had
never
doubted
that
she
would
be
called
to
the
castle
as
soon
as
the
baron
returned
for
she
belonged
there
as
of
old
and
occupied
the
little
gardener
cottage
belonging
to
it
but
her
dreams
were
not
to
come
true
i
must
go
to
him
this
minute
gasped
apollonie
she
had
spoken
rapidly
and
with
intense
excitement
i
want
to
fix
my
master
room
i
am
sure
i
can
do
it
for
all
the
furniture
from
the
different
rooms
is
marked
and
grouped
together
but
shall
i
be
let
in
the
horrible
stubborn
old
watchman
always
keeps
me
out
but
maxa
was
able
to
quiet
her
on
that
score
by
the
baron
recent
promise
and
she
even
urged
apollonie
to
start
directly
the
baron
should
be
told
of
the
situation
and
have
a
bed
prepared
for
him
that
night
after
this
maxa
left
leonore
knowing
where
the
mother
had
gone
flew
to
meet
her
when
she
saw
her
coming
did
he
give
you
the
address
aunt
maxa
she
asked
expectantly
he
means
to
let
you
know
when
he
has
traced
it
this
seemed
quite
hopeful
to
leonore
and
she
was
glad
to
be
able
to
give
her
brother
this
news
maxa
herself
lost
no
time
in
writing
to
the
ladies
in
hanover
that
leonore
uncle
had
returned
and
wished
to
keep
her
near
him
apollonie
was
meanwhile
getting
ready
for
her
walk
her
agitation
was
so
great
that
she
took
rather
long
in
getting
ready
her
toilet
finally
completed
she
hurried
up
the
incline
with
astonishing
ease
for
the
hope
of
being
admitted
to
the
castle
made
her
feel
at
least
ten
years
younger
though
she
still
had
some
doubts
whether
the
door
would
be
opened
for
her
on
her
arrival
she
pulled
the
trius
appeared
quietly
opened
and
silently
walked
away
again
apollonie
who
knew
from
mäzli
where
the
master
was
went
towards
the
terrace
when
she
saw
the
sick
man
she
was
completely
overcome
by
memories
of
former
times
she
only
said
shakily
oh
baron
baron
i
can
not
bear
this
it
is
my
fault
that
you
have
no
proper
room
or
bed
and
ill
and
suffering
as
you
are
apollonie
could
get
no
further
for
sobs
and
tears
the
baron
shook
her
hand
kindly
what
is
the
matter
apollonie
we
have
always
been
good
friends
what
do
you
mean
he
then
heard
from
apollonie
that
it
had
been
the
baroness
wish
to
leave
the
whole
house
unchanged
on
account
of
his
possible
return
apollonie
frankly
admitted
that
she
had
only
moved
the
things
away
to
keep
them
from
being
ruined
and
had
naturally
counted
on
putting
every
object
back
again
as
soon
as
he
came
back
for
she
remembered
where
every
and
tiny
picture
belonged
she
begged
the
baron
permission
to
let
her
fix
his
room
another
one
the
day
after
and
so
on
till
the
castle
looked
again
as
his
mother
had
wished
it
to
be
the
baron
replied
that
apollonie
could
do
whatever
she
chose
adding
that
he
trusted
her
entirely
her
heart
was
filled
with
joy
as
she
ran
towards
the
attic
she
came
down
soon
afterwards
laden
with
blankets
sheets
and
pillows
only
to
go
up
again
for
a
new
load
this
went
on
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
between
times
she
set
the
manifold
objects
in
order
how
gladly
she
put
up
the
heavy
hangings
in
the
baron
room
she
knew
how
he
had
always
loved
the
beautiful
red
color
which
dimmed
the
bright
sunlight
apollonie
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looked
about
her
everything
was
there
down
to
the
two
the
baron
had
last
been
using
which
were
on
the
big
shell
of
the
bronze
inkstand
beside
them
lay
a
black
with
red
and
white
roses
which
miss
leonore
herself
had
embroidered
the
cover
was
half
turned
back
and
the
bed
with
the
high
pillows
was
ready
to
receive
the
sick
man
over
the
bed
hung
a
little
picture
of
his
mother
which
had
been
there
since
his
boyhood
and
apollonie
had
also
remembered
every
other
detail
when
she
went
down
to
the
terrace
a
cool
evening
breeze
was
already
blowing
through
the
branches
of
the
pine
tree
everything
is
ready
baron
she
said
we
are
going
to
carry
you
up
together
because
trius
ca
do
it
alone
i
am
sure
you
will
sleep
well
where
do
you
want
to
take
me
the
baron
asked
surprised
i
am
quite
comfortable
able
here
no
no
baron
it
is
getting
too
cool
for
you
here
your
room
is
a
better
place
at
this
hour
your
mother
would
have
wished
it
i
am
sure
will
you
allow
me
to
call
mr
trius
i
have
to
give
in
i
suppose
the
baron
acquiesced
trius
was
already
on
the
spot
for
he
was
blessed
with
splendid
hearing
you
are
to
carry
me
up
said
the
baron
apollonie
will
show
you
how
it
is
done
apollonie
immediately
seized
him
firmly
about
the
waist
you
do
the
same
trius
she
said
then
please
baron
put
one
arm
about
his
neck
and
one
around
mine
we
shall
clasp
hands
under
your
feet
and
lift
you
up
in
the
most
easy
comfortable
way
the
baron
was
lifted
and
carried
to
his
chamber
and
placed
on
the
fresh
bed
leaning
back
on
the
easy
pillows
he
looked
about
him
how
charming
it
is
he
said
letting
his
glance
rest
here
and
there
you
have
brought
everything
back
apollonie
and
have
made
it
look
the
way
it
was
years
ago
make
things
comfortable
for
him
for
the
night
now
apollonie
whispered
to
trius
leaving
the
room
to
repair
to
the
kitchen
gracious
heavens
what
disorder
she
cried
out
on
entering
for
the
whole
place
was
covered
with
dust
and
opening
a
cupboard
she
saw
only
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
couple
of
eggs
and
this
was
all
she
was
able
to
find
even
on
further
search
what
a
wretch
she
cried
out
in
bitter
rage
he
seems
to
give
his
master
nothing
but
eggs
but
i
know
what
i
do
she
said
to
herself
eagerly
seeking
for
a
key
which
she
discovered
as
of
old
on
a
rusty
nail
next
she
repaired
to
the
cellar
where
she
quickly
found
what
she
was
after
the
bottle
stood
in
sore
need
of
cleaning
however
as
did
everything
else
she
touched
then
she
set
about
beating
two
eggs
adding
a
glass
of
the
strengthening
wine
for
she
had
vividly
recollected
how
much
her
master
used
to
enjoy
this
when
she
entered
his
room
with
this
concoction
a
little
later
the
odor
from
it
was
so
inviting
that
the
baron
breathed
it
in
gratefully
trius
had
left
the
room
and
apollonie
had
put
the
empty
cup
away
and
yet
she
kept
on
setting
trifles
in
order
oh
baron
she
said
finally
there
is
so
much
to
do
still
i
saw
the
kitchen
just
now
if
the
baroness
had
seen
it
as
dirty
as
that
what
would
she
have
said
and
every
other
place
is
the
same
i
feel
as
if
i
could
rest
till
everything
is
set
in
order
i
wish
i
could
work
all
night
no
no
apollonie
you
must
have
a
good
night
rest
i
intend
to
sleep
too
in
this
lovely
bed
he
said
smilingly
would
you
like
to
live
here
again
and
undertake
the
management
of
the
castle
apollonie
stared
at
her
master
at
first
as
if
she
could
not
comprehend
his
words
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
are
you
willing
to
do
it
he
asked
again
am
i
willing
am
i
willing
oh
baron
of
course
i
am
and
you
can
not
know
how
happy
i
am
she
cried
out
with
frank
delight
i
can
come
morning
baron
but
now
i
wonder
what
you
say
you
see
i
am
living
with
my
daughter
child
who
is
twelve
years
old
she
is
a
very
good
child
but
is
scarcely
old
enough
yet
to
help
much
in
the
house
and
garden
how
splendid
when
apollonie
will
be
too
old
to
do
the
work
we
shall
have
a
young
one
to
carry
it
on
said
the
baron
when
you
move
up
here
tomorrow
you
will
know
which
quarters
to
choose
for
yourself
i
know
the
baron
sank
back
with
evident
comfort
into
his
pillows
and
apollonie
wandered
home
with
a
heart
overflowing
with
happiness
at
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
next
morning
she
was
already
in
front
of
her
cottage
packing
only
the
most
necessary
things
for
herself
and
the
child
into
a
cart
as
she
intended
to
fetch
the
rest
of
them
later
loneli
had
just
heard
the
great
news
because
she
had
been
asleep
when
her
grandmother
returned
the
night
before
she
was
so
absolutely
overcome
by
the
prospect
of
becoming
an
inmate
of
the
castle
that
she
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
little
chamber
come
come
the
grandmother
urged
we
have
no
time
for
wondering
as
we
shall
have
to
be
busy
all
day
what
will
kurt
and
mea
say
was
loneli
first
exclamation
she
would
have
loved
to
run
over
to
them
right
away
for
whenever
anything
happened
to
her
she
always
felt
the
wish
to
tell
her
two
best
friends
yes
and
think
what
rector
will
say
apollonie
added
but
let
us
quickly
finish
up
here
for
we
must
get
to
the
castle
as
soon
as
possible
you
are
not
going
to
school
for
the
next
two
days
and
on
sunday
i
hope
to
be
all
done
apollonie
rapidly
tied
up
her
bundle
and
locked
the
cottage
door
then
quickly
setting
out
they
did
not
stop
till
they
had
reached
the
door
trius
after
letting
them
wait
a
while
appeared
with
dragging
steps
why
not
before
daybreak
he
growled
because
you
might
have
been
still
in
bed
and
could
not
have
unlocked
the
door
but
for
that
i
should
have
come
then
apollonie
quickly
retorted
so
he
silently
led
the
way
for
he
had
had
to
realize
that
apollonie
was
not
in
the
least
backward
now
that
she
had
the
master
full
support
she
first
sought
out
her
old
chamber
and
loneli
was
extremely
puzzled
to
see
her
grandmother
wiping
her
eyes
over
and
over
again
the
whole
thing
was
like
a
beautiful
fairy
story
to
the
child
and
she
loved
the
charming
room
with
the
dark
wainscoting
along
the
wall
but
apollonie
did
not
indulge
very
long
in
dreams
and
memories
soon
after
she
was
making
war
on
the
fine
in
the
kitchen
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
it
already
looked
livable
and
cosy
there
trius
smiled
quite
pleasantly
when
he
entered
as
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
brewing
himself
and
his
master
a
cup
of
coffee
the
only
thing
he
usually
added
was
a
piece
of
dry
bread
as
he
was
too
lazy
to
get
milk
and
butter
from
the
neighboring
farmers
and
his
master
had
never
asked
for
either
the
steaming
coffee
and
hot
milk
and
the
fresh
white
bread
apollonie
had
prepared
looked
very
appetizing
to
him
the
wooden
benches
were
clean
scrubbed
and
he
did
object
to
absence
of
the
annoying
which
had
always
tickled
his
nose
apollonie
pouring
the
fragrant
beverage
into
a
large
cup
politely
invited
trius
to
take
his
seat
at
the
table
he
could
not
help
enjoying
the
meal
and
the
new
order
of
things
in
the
kitchen
apollonie
now
prepared
the
breakfast
tray
setting
on
it
the
good
old
china
that
the
baroness
had
always
used
she
had
put
a
plate
with
round
beside
the
steaming
and
fresh
round
rolls
peeped
invitingly
from
an
little
china
basket
when
apollonie
came
to
her
master
room
he
exclaimed
oh
how
good
this
looks
just
like
old
times
at
first
he
thought
that
even
looking
at
it
would
do
him
good
but
apollonie
did
not
agree
with
him
please
take
a
little
baron
she
begged
him
otherwise
your
strength
will
not
come
back
take
a
little
bit
at
first
and
gradually
more
and
more
i
know
you
will
like
the
butter
loneli
got
it
at
the
best
farm
hereabouts
after
tasting
a
little
the
baron
was
surprised
how
good
it
was
when
her
master
was
comfortably
sitting
in
the
lovely
morning
sun
apollonie
fetched
loneli
out
she
wanted
the
child
to
thank
him
for
receiving
her
into
his
house
now
the
great
task
of
cleaning
and
moving
began
and
it
took
a
whole
day
of
feverish
activity
to
get
the
rooms
in
the
castle
settled
only
at
meal
times
was
this
interrupted
for
apollonie
did
not
look
at
this
as
a
minor
matter
and
she
carefully
planned
what
to
give
her
master
for
trius
she
had
to
consider
the
quantity
for
he
seemed
to
have
an
excellent
appetite
and
clearly
enjoyed
coming
to
the
kitchen
he
had
begun
to
show
his
gratitude
to
apollonie
by
willingly
carrying
the
heavy
furniture
about
two
days
had
passed
in
uninterrupted
work
and
apollonie
had
accomplished
what
she
had
set
out
to
do
when
she
brought
her
master
his
breakfast
on
sunday
she
stood
irresolutely
holding
the
doorknob
in
her
hand
have
you
something
to
tell
me
apollonie
you
certainly
ca
complain
that
i
do
appreciate
your
delicious
coffee
just
look
at
the
progress
i
am
making
with
comical
seriousness
the
baron
pointed
to
the
empty
cup
and
the
sole
remaining
roll
god
be
thanked
and
praised
for
that
she
said
joyfully
i
shall
tell
you
because
you
asked
me
i
wonder
if
you
would
give
me
a
little
sunday
pleasure
by
inspecting
all
the
rooms
i
have
your
chair
already
at
the
door
after
the
great
work
apollonie
had
done
his
only
objection
was
that
she
desired
something
which
meant
pleasure
for
him
and
labour
for
her
but
he
was
willing
enough
to
be
put
into
the
heavy
it
is
wonderful
what
you
have
done
apollonie
he
concluded
you
seem
to
have
even
changed
trius
from
an
old
bear
into
an
obedient
lamb
soon
after
the
baron
sat
propped
up
in
his
here
guided
by
apollonie
he
was
taken
first
of
all
to
the
large
which
had
witnessed
all
the
happy
gatherings
of
the
family
and
their
friends
it
actually
glistened
in
its
renewed
splendor
and
the
baron
silently
looked
about
him
the
tower
room
which
had
been
his
brother
salo
abode
was
inspected
next
and
again
the
baron
uttered
no
word
beautiful
portraits
of
his
ancestors
adorned
these
walls
and
he
recalled
how
salo
had
loved
them
apollonie
moved
next
to
the
room
of
the
baroness
where
every
object
was
in
its
place
again
the
faithful
servant
noticed
how
her
glances
drank
it
all
in
and
as
they
remained
he
still
showed
no
desire
to
leave
my
mother
was
sitting
in
this
when
i
last
spoke
to
her
he
said
at
last
and
this
red
pin
cushion
was
lying
on
the
table
before
her
i
remember
standing
there
and
playing
with
the
pins
and
i
can
recall
every
word
she
said
do
carry
me
down
apollonie
he
continued
after
a
pause
i
want
to
spend
my
sunday
here
i
am
glad
there
are
no
more
empty
rooms
to
flee
from
apollonie
was
more
gratified
than
she
could
say
that
her
master
was
beginning
to
feel
at
home
and
hoped
that
it
would
soon
become
dear
to
him
she
wanted
him
to
see
also
leonore
bright
and
cheerful
room
which
the
baroness
had
had
furnished
in
the
daintiest
way
and
was
unable
to
suppress
her
wish
please
baron
take
one
more
small
trip
with
me
she
begged
we
can
soon
come
back
here
as
he
raised
no
objection
they
set
out
through
the
windows
of
the
room
the
woods
could
be
seen
flocks
of
gay
birds
sat
carolling
on
the
luxuriant
branches
of
the
fir
trees
and
their
songs
filled
the
room
with
laughter
the
baron
let
his
gaze
roam
out
to
the
trees
with
their
merry
minstrels
and
back
again
to
the
pleasant
chamber
you
have
accomplished
miracles
apollonie
he
cried
out
it
only
took
you
two
days
to
change
this
mournful
cave
into
a
pleasant
abode
where
young
people
could
be
happy
please
take
me
back
to
my
room
now
and
come
to
me
as
soon
as
you
find
time
for
i
have
something
to
talk
over
with
you
an
interview
lasting
a
considerable
time
took
place
that
afternoon
loneli
had
been
thinking
about
kurt
and
mea
while
she
was
wandering
happily
up
and
down
the
terrace
and
she
wondered
how
soon
they
would
hear
of
the
great
event
she
was
very
anxious
for
them
to
pay
her
a
visit
for
which
she
was
already
making
plans
when
loneli
came
back
from
her
stroll
she
saw
her
grandmother
sitting
on
the
sobbing
violently
but
grandmother
why
are
you
crying
everything
is
so
wonderful
here
and
all
the
birds
outside
are
singing
i
am
singing
with
them
in
my
heart
child
these
tears
are
tears
of
joy
said
the
grandmother
sit
down
loneli
and
i
tell
you
what
is
going
to
happen
i
feel
as
if
this
happiness
was
too
much
for
me
loneli
apollonie
was
once
more
swept
away
by
emotion
and
it
took
her
a
little
time
before
she
could
tell
loneli
the
wonderful
news
on
this
day
it
was
so
quiet
in
maxa
garden
that
it
hardly
seemed
as
if
the
whole
family
was
gathered
in
the
gardens
the
thought
of
its
being
leonore
last
sunday
kept
them
from
being
gay
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
playing
a
game
which
they
usually
enjoyed
the
mother
thoughts
were
wandering
too
for
she
had
waited
all
day
to
get
news
from
the
castle
wondering
what
this
meant
maxa
found
it
difficult
to
keep
her
attention
on
the
children
mäzli
undertook
a
little
stroll
from
time
to
time
for
her
companions
depressed
her
very
much
she
had
been
to
see
kathy
who
was
sitting
near
the
and
had
chatted
occasionally
with
the
passers
but
now
she
returned
carrying
a
letter
a
boy
brought
it
and
kathy
asked
him
from
whom
it
was
but
he
know
she
explained
give
it
to
me
mäzli
said
the
mother
it
is
addressed
to
leonore
though
she
added
a
bit
frightened
but
leonore
put
both
hands
up
to
her
face
please
read
it
aunt
maxa
i
ca
you
need
not
be
frightened
children
she
said
quickly
with
a
joyful
flush
on
her
cheeks
listen
as
the
wants
to
see
his
two
young
friends
leonore
and
mäzli
again
he
invites
them
with
the
rest
of
the
family
including
the
mother
to
spend
the
following
day
at
castle
wildenstein
i
am
glad
said
mäzli
rapidly
then
kurt
can
see
that
the
and
trius
are
two
people
the
children
had
been
entirely
taken
aback
by
fright
which
turned
into
surprise
but
they
began
to
shout
joyfully
now
for
the
prospect
of
being
invited
to
the
castle
was
an
event
nobody
could
have
predicted
for
years
they
had
only
seen
the
mysterious
shuttered
doors
and
windows
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
were
delighted
mea
had
heartily
voiced
her
delight
with
the
others
till
she
noticed
that
leonore
had
become
very
quiet
and
melancholy
but
leonore
she
exclaimed
why
do
you
look
forward
to
the
lovely
day
we
are
going
to
have
i
ca
imagine
anything
nicer
than
to
be
able
to
inspect
the
whole
castle
i
ca
leonore
replied
i
know
too
well
that
everything
will
be
over
after
that
day
and
i
may
even
never
see
you
any
more
poor
mea
was
deeply
affected
by
these
words
and
immediately
her
joy
had
flown
it
was
rather
difficult
to
quiet
everybody
down
in
bed
that
night
and
even
when
kurt
had
gone
to
sleep
he
uttered
strange
triumphant
exclamations
for
in
his
dreams
the
boy
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
highest
battlement
at
ten
next
morning
all
the
children
were
ready
to
leave
and
had
formed
a
regular
procession
bruno
and
kurt
had
placed
themselves
at
the
head
and
were
only
waiting
for
their
mother
now
the
two
boys
started
off
at
such
a
rate
that
no
one
else
could
keep
up
with
them
so
the
mother
appointed
leonore
and
mea
as
guides
and
herself
followed
with
mäzli
she
firmly
held
the
little
girl
hand
for
there
was
no
telling
what
she
might
undertake
otherwise
and
the
less
independent
lippo
held
his
mother
other
hand
so
that
the
two
older
brothers
were
obliged
to
accommodate
their
steps
to
the
rest
but
kurt
simply
bursting
with
impatience
dashed
ahead
once
only
to
drop
behind
again
later
on
he
would
appear
from
behind
a
hedge
lippo
simply
could
not
stand
such
disorder
and
to
even
up
the
pairs
he
took
bruno
hand
when
they
reached
the
familiar
door
at
last
to
their
surprise
both
wings
of
it
were
thrown
open
trius
with
his
hat
lowered
to
the
ground
stood
at
his
post
to
receive
them
shining
silver
buttons
set
off
a
coat
which
plainly
belonged
to
his
gala
suit
kurt
was
so
completely
confounded
by
this
reception
that
he
quickly
fell
into
line
with
the
rest
and
the
procession
proceeded
the
first
thing
they
saw
on
the
terrace
was
a
long
festive
table
with
garlands
of
ivy
and
flowers
apollonie
soon
after
appeared
in
a
beautiful
silk
gown
the
baroness
had
given
her
and
her
measured
movements
made
the
occasion
seem
extremely
solemn
she
had
to
all
appearance
become
castle
apollonie
again
loneli
wearing
a
pretty
dress
and
carrying
a
huge
bouquet
of
flowers
stepped
up
to
leonore
then
she
handed
her
the
flowers
and
recited
in
a
clear
impressive
voice
the
following
words
which
apollonie
had
composed
herself
thrice
welcome
to
this
home
of
thine
lady
of
castle
wildenstein
leonore
rigid
with
surprise
first
stared
at
loneli
then
looked
at
the
mother
maxa
took
leonore
hand
and
led
her
to
the
baron
who
had
smilingly
surveyed
the
scene
i
think
that
her
uncle
is
going
to
make
his
little
niece
a
speech
at
last
maxa
said
placing
leonore
hand
in
her
uncle
like
a
flash
comprehension
dawned
on
leonore
dear
uncle
dear
uncle
she
cried
out
embracing
him
tenderly
is
it
really
true
that
you
are
my
uncle
is
this
wonderful
thing
really
true
yes
child
i
am
the
uncle
you
longed
to
love
like
a
father
said
the
baron
i
want
to
be
your
father
and
i
hope
you
can
love
me
a
little
will
you
mind
living
with
me
leonore
oh
dear
dear
uncle
leonore
repeated
with
renewed
signs
of
warm
affection
it
is
not
very
hard
to
love
you
when
you
told
me
that
my
uncle
in
spain
was
sick
and
miserable
i
wished
he
could
be
just
like
you
i
really
ca
quite
believe
that
salo
and
i
may
live
with
you
in
this
wonderful
castle
where
i
can
be
so
near
aunt
maxa
and
everybody
i
love
i
wonder
what
salo
will
say
may
i
write
to
him
today
and
let
him
know
that
we
shall
have
a
home
with
you
how
do
you
do
mäzli
said
that
moment
thrusting
a
plump
round
hand
between
and
the
baron
mäzli
had
actually
made
use
of
the
first
moment
her
hand
was
free
now
kurt
can
see
for
himself
that
you
and
trius
are
two
people
ca
he
mr
steward
this
certainly
must
be
cleared
up
the
baron
answered
shaking
hand
we
shall
prove
to
them
all
that
mäzli
knows
what
she
has
seen
leonore
i
want
to
meet
your
friends
now
wo
you
bring
them
to
me
the
children
were
all
standing
around
their
mother
and
apollonie
who
were
clearing
up
the
mystery
for
them
the
mother
had
barely
been
able
to
check
their
violent
outbreak
but
could
not
quite
quench
all
enthusiasm
when
they
heard
that
leonore
had
come
to
introduce
them
to
her
uncle
they
were
a
little
scared
but
leonore
understood
their
hesitation
and
declared
just
come
you
have
no
idea
how
nice
he
is
pulling
mea
with
her
she
compelled
the
others
to
follow
and
arriving
at
her
uncle
side
she
immediately
began
this
is
bruno
my
best
friend
and
this
is
mea
my
best
friend
i
never
had
a
friend
like
her
in
all
my
life
this
is
kurt
kurt
is
my
friend
said
the
uncle
i
know
him
because
he
is
the
poet
i
hope
he
make
songs
about
us
all
now
i
know
the
one
about
mr
trius
quite
taken
aback
kurt
looked
at
the
baron
how
could
he
know
that
song
his
mother
had
strictly
forbidden
him
to
show
it
to
anyone
and
he
had
only
read
it
aloud
at
home
how
could
a
stranger
hear
about
it
you
can
say
in
your
new
song
that
and
trius
are
two
persons
and
not
one
you
can
see
that
yourself
mäzli
declared
aloud
kurt
then
suddenly
understood
that
his
impudent
small
sister
had
probably
been
the
informer
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
answer
but
leonore
helped
him
over
his
embarrassment
by
continuing
this
is
lippo
uncle
who
has
asked
me
to
live
with
him
when
he
is
grown
up
is
he
a
wonderful
friend
uncle
he
knew
i
had
no
home
you
have
quite
marvellous
friends
leonore
said
the
baron
they
must
visit
you
very
often
if
maxa
will
allow
it
gladly
and
i
know
that
their
happiness
will
be
yours
too
when
you
see
them
all
wandering
through
the
house
and
garden
yes
all
of
us
and
salo
too
leonore
exclaimed
do
you
think
salo
will
soon
be
here
uncle
apollonie
had
approached
the
lively
group
under
the
pine
tree
and
as
there
happened
to
be
a
suitable
pause
she
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
i
really
ought
to
invite
my
dear
friend
maxa
to
come
to
the
table
i
shall
ask
however
who
is
going
to
take
me
said
the
baron
all
the
children
immediately
cried
i
i
i
i
i
i
and
hands
caught
hold
of
the
back
and
both
sides
of
the
baron
chair
i
am
driving
in
a
coach
and
six
how
things
have
changed
for
me
the
gentleman
said
smilingly
the
meal
apollonie
had
planned
was
a
great
success
and
the
open
air
on
the
terrace
added
to
the
enjoyment
when
the
fruit
course
which
consisted
of
yellow
plums
was
eaten
the
baron
gave
the
young
birds
as
he
called
the
children
permission
to
fly
freely
about
it
seemed
to
crown
all
the
preceding
pleasures
to
be
able
to
roam
without
restraint
in
the
woods
and
meadows
first
of
all
they
ran
towards
the
adjoining
woods
where
their
need
for
an
outlet
could
be
gratified
long
years
to
you
leonore
bruno
cried
now
you
and
salo
are
going
to
have
a
wonderful
home
quite
near
to
us
is
it
splendid
when
salo
comes
we
shall
be
together
long
live
the
baron
kurt
screamed
now
with
all
his
might
hurrah
for
castle
wildenstein
the
wonderful
new
home
long
live
apollonie
but
where
is
loneli
he
suddenly
interrupted
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
outburst
she
ought
to
be
here
too
when
everybody
agreed
with
him
kurt
dashed
towards
the
terrace
where
loneli
was
just
helping
her
grandmother
carry
away
the
dishes
we
want
to
have
loneli
with
us
apollonie
please
let
her
come
with
me
kurt
explained
his
errand
who
wants
her
do
you
say
apollonie
began
rather
severely
despite
a
glad
note
in
her
voice
which
could
not
be
disguised
everybody
does
and
leonore
especially
was
kurt
sly
answer
you
can
go
loneli
said
the
grandmother
you
must
celebrate
this
great
day
with
them
loneli
actually
glowed
with
joy
when
she
ran
off
with
kurt
as
they
were
sitting
under
the
pine
tree
the
baron
and
maxa
were
reviving
memories
of
long
ago
and
he
listened
with
great
emotion
when
maxa
told
him
how
faithfully
his
mother
had
tried
to
send
him
news
her
letters
had
however
miscarried
because
he
had
changed
his
residence
so
frequently
but
he
had
wanted
him
to
know
how
constant
his
mother
love
had
been
and
how
anxiously
she
was
waiting
his
return
maxa
he
said
after
a
little
pause
i
feel
terribly
ashamed
i
came
here
with
anger
and
hate
in
my
heart
against
god
and
man
and
my
only
hope
was
to
die
as
soon
as
possible
i
expected
to
be
forsaken
and
despised
and
instead
of
that
i
meet
only
kindness
and
love
on
every
side
i
never
deserved
such
a
thing
do
you
think
i
can
ever
atone
for
all
the
wrong
i
done
we
must
always
bear
in
mind
that
there
is
one
who
is
glad
to
forgive
us
our
sins
baron
and
he
can
deliver
us
from
them
if
we
sincerely
beg
him
to
maxa
answered
as
the
baron
remained
silent
maxa
added
will
you
let
me
say
something
to
you
on
the
strength
of
our
old
friendship
baron
bruno
certainly
i
can
trust
my
dear
maxa
to
say
only
what
is
right
he
replied
i
have
noticed
that
you
have
evaded
mentioning
the
name
salo
that
you
seemed
reluctant
to
answer
leonore
questions
concerning
his
possible
coming
i
know
that
bitter
memories
are
connected
with
the
name
but
i
also
want
you
to
know
that
you
will
deprive
yourself
of
a
great
blessing
if
you
banish
the
boy
who
bears
that
name
please
let
him
come
here
if
only
for
a
little
while
maxa
begged
yet
more
strongly
so
that
you
can
see
him
if
you
willingly
see
him
who
may
be
the
pride
and
joy
of
your
life
then
open
the
door
of
his
home
because
before
god
it
is
right
which
you
must
feel
as
fully
as
i
the
baron
was
silent
then
finally
said
salo
may
come
maxa
face
shone
with
joy
and
gratitude
many
things
had
still
to
be
discussed
and
the
two
old
friends
remained
sitting
under
the
pine
tree
till
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
were
throwing
a
rosy
light
over
the
gray
castle
the
children
were
at
last
returning
from
their
walk
across
the
meadows
they
looked
like
a
garden
when
they
approached
the
baron
chair
for
they
were
covered
with
garlands
of
poppies
ivy
and
cornflowers
now
supper
was
announced
and
the
baron
was
escorted
to
the
terrace
as
before
it
was
a
true
triumphal
march
this
time
when
he
throned
in
his
chair
with
the
on
his
knees
was
pushed
along
by
the
gaily
decked
children
the
baron
told
them
how
much
he
would
enjoy
taking
a
similar
ride
into
the
fields
some
day
when
maxa
gave
the
sign
for
parting
after
the
merry
supper
party
no
sign
of
grief
was
shown
because
the
baron
had
already
told
them
that
leonore
was
to
move
up
into
the
castle
in
a
few
days
they
were
all
to
be
present
then
after
that
there
would
be
no
end
to
their
visits
when
the
baron
shook
mäzli
hand
at
parting
he
said
you
came
to
see
me
first
mäzli
so
you
shall
always
be
my
special
friend
yes
i
be
your
friend
mäzli
said
firmly
when
leonore
tenderly
took
leave
of
her
uncle
she
whispered
in
his
ear
may
salo
come
soon
uncle
this
time
the
answer
was
a
clear
affirmative
and
the
child
heart
was
filled
with
rapture
oh
aunt
maxa
he
cried
aloud
ca
we
sing
our
evening
song
up
here
i
should
love
to
sing
the
song
my
mother
used
to
sing
when
consent
was
given
they
grouped
themselves
about
the
baron
chair
and
sang
god
who
disposes
all
things
well
i
want
but
what
thou
givest
me
oh
how
can
we
thine
acts
foretell
when
thou
are
far
more
wise
than
we
all
the
way
home
the
children
kept
looking
back
at
the
castle
for
their
day
had
been
too
marvellous
the
next
day
three
letters
were
sent
to
salo
one
from
bruno
and
one
from
leonore
both
full
of
enthusiasm
about
the
great
event
of
the
day
before
and
one
from
maxa
the
last
thrilled
salo
most
because
it
contained
a
summons
for
him
to
come
to
his
new
home
the
news
that
baron
bruno
had
come
back
and
that
apollonie
had
resumed
her
old
post
at
the
castle
had
spread
all
over
the
neighborhood
everybody
had
heard
that
loneli
also
was
living
at
the
castle
that
baron
salo
daughter
had
come
and
his
son
was
soon
to
be
there
the
report
that
rector
bergmann
whole
family
had
spent
a
day
at
the
castle
was
reported
too
and
everybody
talked
about
the
intimate
friendship
of
the
two
families
a
few
days
after
the
celebration
at
the
castle
the
district
wife
came
to
call
on
maxa
she
lost
no
time
in
telling
her
hostess
that
she
counted
on
baron
salo
son
joining
the
other
three
lads
in
town
and
that
her
husband
had
agreed
to
look
up
another
room
for
him
she
had
no
doubt
that
the
sons
of
the
three
most
important
families
of
nolla
ought
naturally
to
live
and
study
together
and
she
knew
that
every
effort
would
be
made
to
find
salo
a
suitable
room
even
if
the
application
came
rather
late
maxa
did
not
need
to
mind
these
annoying
negotiations
now
but
calmly
replied
that
the
baron
would
send
his
nephew
to
the
high
school
in
the
city
and
would
undoubtedly
make
his
own
arrangements
knippel
after
remarking
that
her
husband
counted
on
seeing
the
baron
himself
withdrew
a
moment
after
she
left
loneli
came
into
the
house
to
see
mea
just
think
mea
the
loneli
said
to
her
i
have
a
message
for
you
from
elvira
she
wants
you
to
know
that
she
is
willing
to
forgive
you
on
condition
that
she
may
meet
leonore
she
wants
to
be
her
friend
and
sit
beside
her
in
school
it
too
late
now
and
it
wo
help
her
i
do
care
whether
she
wants
to
make
up
with
me
or
not
mea
said
placidly
neither
leonore
nor
i
are
going
to
school
you
wo
have
to
go
either
loneli
because
a
lady
is
coming
to
the
castle
to
teach
us
all
baron
wallerstätten
and
mama
have
settled
it
so
i
know
it
loneli
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
the
surprise
seemed
too
great
then
i
sha
have
to
sit
on
the
any
more
she
said
with
a
beaming
face
for
a
heavy
trouble
was
removed
from
her
heart
you
can
ask
leonore
if
she
wants
to
meet
elvira
said
mea
for
leonore
had
stepped
up
to
them
but
loneli
message
held
no
interest
whatever
for
leonore
who
wished
for
no
new
acquaintances
she
only
desired
to
give
the
time
she
was
not
spending
with
her
uncle
to
mea
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
least
of
all
she
wished
to
meet
a
girl
who
had
been
so
disagreeable
to
her
beloved
mea
uncle
philip
had
been
away
on
a
business
trip
on
his
arrival
home
he
received
the
following
note
from
his
sister
if
you
still
want
to
see
leonore
with
us
come
as
soon
as
possible
she
is
going
to
live
with
her
uncle
at
the
castle
in
a
very
few
days
i
shall
tell
you
all
about
it
when
you
come
he
arrived
the
very
next
morning
and
as
soon
as
he
met
his
sister
he
exploded
i
was
quite
sure
maxa
that
you
would
immediately
deliver
the
little
dove
into
the
vulture
claws
i
wish
i
had
never
put
her
in
your
care
come
in
philip
and
sit
down
maxa
said
composedly
we
are
going
to
have
dinner
in
a
moment
and
then
you
will
have
the
chance
to
ask
the
dove
herself
what
she
thinks
of
the
vulture
claws
uncle
philip
opened
the
door
and
found
the
children
absolutely
immersed
in
the
recent
events
the
instant
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
they
rushed
up
to
him
and
fairly
flooded
him
with
news
their
speeches
came
thick
and
fast
and
he
heard
nothing
but
manifestations
of
love
for
the
dear
good
baron
leonore
charming
uncle
the
good
kind
mäzli
had
not
given
up
this
title
even
now
do
you
see
philip
that
you
ca
swim
against
the
stream
said
maxa
when
she
was
sitting
alone
with
her
brother
after
dinner
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
pay
your
old
friend
a
call
that
would
add
you
to
the
list
of
his
admirers
instead
of
your
bearing
him
a
grudge
but
uncle
philip
violently
objected
to
this
proposal
baron
bruno
spoke
of
you
with
a
sincere
feeling
of
attachment
which
you
apparently
do
deserve
his
sister
said
he
was
afraid
of
your
feeling
towards
him
though
listen
to
what
he
said
fear
that
he
wo
wish
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
and
i
shall
be
powerless
in
that
case
i
wo
refuse
the
hand
of
an
old
friend
though
maxa
said
the
brother
now
if
he
offers
it
to
me
to
reestablish
peace
what
is
he
going
to
do
for
salo
son
salo
has
already
been
sent
word
that
he
is
to
have
the
castle
of
his
ancestors
for
a
home
replied
maxa
i
am
going
out
for
a
walk
uncle
philip
said
suddenly
taking
down
his
hat
from
the
peg
and
maxa
guessed
quite
well
where
he
was
going
he
reappeared
at
supper
time
and
sat
down
with
merry
eyes
in
the
midst
of
them
all
leonore
he
began
as
soon
as
you
are
the
mistress
of
the
castle
i
shall
often
be
your
guest
your
uncle
and
i
have
just
done
some
business
together
he
told
me
how
different
everything
used
to
be
in
the
castle
grounds
and
that
he
regretted
not
understanding
about
these
matters
so
he
asked
me
to
take
charge
of
things
as
they
were
in
my
special
field
he
hoped
my
old
attachment
to
the
place
at
these
words
uncle
voice
became
quite
hoarse
suddenly
maxa
your
is
so
sweet
it
makes
one
hoarse
he
said
for
he
would
never
admit
that
he
had
been
overcome
by
deep
emotion
so
i
have
undertaken
to
attend
to
the
matter
and
i
shall
often
come
to
the
castle
that
uncle
philip
belonged
to
the
castle
too
now
awoke
hearty
outbursts
from
the
children
which
the
mother
happily
joined
for
it
had
been
her
greatest
wish
that
the
two
should
become
friends
again
the
last
evening
before
leonore
was
to
move
into
the
castle
had
come
and
the
children
were
all
sitting
in
a
little
corner
they
were
in
the
most
cheerful
mood
busily
making
delightful
plans
for
the
future
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
wild
shrieks
of
joy
burst
from
everybody
salo
salo
salo
they
all
cried
out
the
boy
had
just
arrived
in
time
to
have
a
last
splendid
evening
with
his
friends
before
moving
into
his
new
home
the
next
day
turned
out
more
wonderful
than
they
had
ever
dared
to
dream
and
it
was
followed
again
by
a
succession
of
other
days
as
delightful
every
time
the
children
came
together
it
seemed
like
a
new
party
and
the
baron
took
great
care
that
those
parties
did
not
end
too
quickly
kurt
had
soon
informed
salo
and
bruno
that
there
was
a
large
hall
with
weapons
and
armor
at
the
ground
floor
of
the
castle
when
the
boys
asked
apollonie
to
admit
them
she
opened
a
little
side
door
for
them
because
trius
had
hidden
the
other
key
salo
lifted
the
armoured
knight
to
his
shoulders
and
had
the
long
blue
cloak
draped
around
him
he
looked
like
a
frightful
giant
as
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
big
room
and
kurt
recognized
the
ghost
of
wildenstein
he
had
seen
that
dreadful
night
salo
with
his
charming
disposition
soon
entirely
won
over
his
uncle
who
decided
to
send
his
nephew
to
the
neighboring
town
to
study
and
salo
and
bruno
were
to
spend
their
as
well
as
their
holidays
together
when
the
summer
holidays
were
over
salo
and
bruno
moved
into
town
but
even
this
did
not
prove
very
hard
the
children
were
not
to
be
separated
very
long
for
the
boys
were
to
spend
many
at
home
besides
all
their
holidays
bruno
had
soon
written
to
his
mother
from
town
that
she
need
not
worry
at
all
about
the
knippel
boys
as
they
scarcely
ever
saw
them
when
maxa
can
not
help
recalling
all
her
former
fears
and
plans
for
the
future
because
her
son
violent
temper
caused
her
such
anxiety
she
said
to
herself
with
a
glad
heart
oh
how
can
we
thine
acts
foretell
when
thou
are
far
more
wise
than
we
apollonie
has
become
the
real
true
of
yore
and
manages
for
her
master
sake
to
live
in
undisturbed
peace
with
trius
she
is
taking
such
good
care
of
the
baron
and
his
little
adopted
daughter
that
a
bloom
of
health
has
spread
over
their
cheeks
on
sunny
days
the
baron
can
frequently
be
seen
walking
up
and
down
the
terrace
on
arm
and
his
young
guide
is
very
careful
of
his
health
and
looks
after
him
tenderly
the
sound
of
a
beautiful
voice
can
often
be
heard
through
the
open
castle
windows
for
leonore
has
inherited
her
mother
voice
and
it
gives
her
uncle
the
keenest
pleasure
to
listen
to
the
songs
she
used
to
sing
in
bygone
days
the
people
in
nolla
unanimously
agree
that
the
ghost
of
wildenstein
has
gone
to
his
eternal
rest
because
peace
again
is
reigning
at
the
castle
the
end
