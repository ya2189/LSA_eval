uncle
john
duty
you
not
doing
your
duty
by
those
girls
john
merrick
the
gentleman
at
whom
this
assertion
was
flung
in
a
rather
angry
tone
did
not
answer
his
he
sat
gazing
reflectively
at
the
pattern
in
the
rug
and
seemed
neither
startled
nor
annoyed
merrick
a
lady
attired
in
an
elaborate
morning
gown
knitted
her
brows
severely
as
she
regarded
the
chubby
little
man
opposite
then
suddenly
remembering
that
the
wrinkles
might
leave
their
dreadful
mark
on
her
carefully
rolled
and
massaged
features
she
banished
them
with
a
pass
of
her
ringed
hand
and
sighed
dismally
it
would
not
have
mattered
especially
had
the
poor
children
been
left
in
their
original
condition
of
friendless
poverty
she
said
they
were
then
like
a
million
other
girls
content
to
struggle
for
a
respectable
livelihood
and
a
doubtful
position
in
the
lower
stratas
of
social
communion
but
you
interfered
you
came
into
their
lives
abruptly
appearing
from
those
horrid
western
wilds
with
an
amazing
accumulation
of
money
and
a
demand
that
your
three
nieces
become
your
special
and
what
is
the
result
the
little
man
looked
up
with
a
charming
smile
of
good
humored
raillery
his
keen
gray
eyes
sparkled
as
mischievously
as
a
schoolboy
softly
he
rubbed
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
as
if
enjoying
the
situation
what
is
it
martha
my
dear
what
is
the
result
he
asked
you
raised
them
from
their
lowly
condition
to
a
sphere
in
which
they
reign
as
queens
the
envy
of
all
who
know
them
you
lavished
your
millions
upon
them
unsparingly
they
are
not
only
presumptive
heiresses
but
already
possessed
of
independent
fortunes
ah
you
think
you
been
generous
to
these
girls
do
you
john
merrick
go
on
martha
go
on
you
taken
them
abroad
you
took
my
own
daughter
john
merrick
and
left
at
home
you
lugged
your
three
nieces
to
the
mountains
and
carried
them
to
the
seashore
you
even
encouraged
them
to
enlist
in
an
unseemly
campaign
to
elect
that
young
imbecile
kenneth
forbes
and
oh
martha
martha
get
to
the
point
if
you
can
i
going
presently
not
until
you
heard
me
out
you
given
your
nieces
every
advantage
in
your
power
save
one
and
the
neglect
of
that
one
thing
renders
futile
all
else
you
have
accomplished
now
indeed
her
listener
seemed
perplexed
he
passed
a
hand
over
his
shiny
bald
head
as
if
to
stimulate
thought
and
exorcise
bewilderment
what
is
it
then
what
have
i
neglected
was
his
mild
enquiry
to
give
those
girls
their
proper
standing
in
society
he
started
smiled
then
looked
grave
you
talking
foolishly
he
said
why
confound
it
martha
as
good
girls
as
ever
lived
they
highly
respected
and
sir
i
refer
to
fashionable
society
the
capitals
indicate
the
impressive
manner
in
which
merrick
pronounced
those
words
i
guess
money
makes
folks
fashionable
do
it
martha
no
indeed
how
ignorant
you
are
john
can
you
not
understand
that
there
is
a
cultured
aristocratic
and
exclusive
society
in
new
york
that
millions
will
not
enable
one
to
gain
to
oh
is
there
then
i
helpless
you
are
not
sir
eh
i
thought
you
said
listen
john
and
for
heaven
sake
try
for
once
to
be
receptive
i
am
speaking
not
only
for
the
welfare
of
my
daughter
louise
but
for
beth
and
patricia
your
nieces
are
charming
girls
all
three
with
the
advantages
you
have
given
them
they
may
well
become
social
celebrities
would
they
be
happier
so
of
course
every
true
woman
longs
for
social
distinction
especially
if
it
seems
difficult
to
acquire
nothing
is
dearer
to
a
girl
heart
than
to
win
acceptance
by
the
right
social
set
and
new
york
society
is
the
most
exclusive
in
america
i
afraid
it
will
continue
to
exclude
our
girls
martha
not
if
you
do
your
duty
john
that
reminds
me
what
is
your
idea
of
my
duty
martha
you
been
talking
in
riddles
so
far
he
protested
shifting
uneasily
in
his
chair
let
me
explain
more
concisely
then
your
millions
john
merrick
have
made
you
really
famous
even
in
this
wealthy
metropolis
in
the
city
and
at
your
club
you
must
meet
with
men
who
have
the
to
the
most
desirable
social
circles
men
who
might
be
induced
to
introduce
your
nieces
to
their
families
whose
endorsement
would
effect
their
proper
presentation
nonsense
it
is
nonsense
at
all
then
blamed
if
i
know
what
you
driving
at
you
very
obtuse
i
wo
agree
to
that
till
i
know
what
means
see
here
martha
you
say
this
social
position
that
the
girls
are
so
crazy
for
but
they
never
said
anything
to
about
it
ca
be
bought
in
the
next
breath
you
urge
me
to
buy
it
phoo
you
a
thoughtless
silly
woman
martha
and
let
your
wild
ambitions
run
away
with
your
common
sense
merrick
sighed
but
stubbornly
maintained
her
position
i
do
suggest
such
people
not
at
all
john
it
what
is
called
ah
ah
or
or
or
is
a
better
word
martha
do
you
imagine
there
any
value
in
social
position
that
can
be
acquired
by
of
course
it
has
to
be
acquired
some
way
if
one
is
not
born
to
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
louise
is
entitled
through
her
connection
with
family
pshaw
i
knew
family
martha
he
interrupted
an
arrant
lot
of
humbugs
john
merrick
do
get
riled
it
the
truth
i
on
her
father
side
louise
has
just
as
much
to
brag
about
an
no
more
we
merricks
never
amounted
to
much
an
did
hanker
to
trip
the
light
fantastic
in
swell
society
once
though
when
i
was
a
boy
i
had
a
cousin
who
spelled
down
the
whole
crowd
at
a
we
were
quite
proud
of
him
then
but
he
went
wrong
after
his
triumph
poor
fellow
and
became
a
book
agent
now
martha
i
imagine
this
talk
of
yours
is
all
hot
air
and
worked
off
on
me
not
because
the
girls
want
society
but
because
you
want
it
for
it
all
ambition
i
bet
a
peanut
you
misjudge
me
as
usual
john
i
am
urging
a
matter
of
simple
justice
your
nieces
are
lovely
girls
fitted
to
shine
in
any
sphere
of
life
she
continued
knowing
his
weak
point
and
diplomatically
fostering
it
our
girls
have
youth
accomplishments
money
everything
to
fit
them
for
social
triumphs
the
winter
season
is
now
approaching
the
people
are
flocking
back
to
town
from
their
country
homes
fashionable
gaieties
and
notable
events
will
soon
hold
full
sway
the
dear
girls
are
surely
entitled
to
enjoy
these
things
do
you
think
are
they
the
best
that
life
has
to
offer
and
why
they
enter
society
if
you
do
your
full
duty
once
get
them
properly
introduced
and
they
will
be
able
to
hold
their
own
with
perfect
ease
give
me
the
credit
for
knowing
these
things
john
and
try
to
help
your
nieces
to
attain
their
ambition
but
it
their
ambition
he
asked
doubtfully
they
have
not
said
so
in
words
but
i
can
assure
you
it
their
ambition
because
all
three
are
sensible
spirited
young
women
who
live
in
this
age
and
not
the
one
you
yourself
knew
a
half
century
or
so
ago
merrick
sighed
and
rubbed
his
head
again
then
he
slowly
rose
mornin
martha
he
said
with
a
somewhat
abstracted
nod
at
his
this
is
a
new
idea
to
me
i
think
it
over
chapter
ii
a
question
of
pull
john
merrick
face
was
not
so
cheery
as
usual
as
he
made
his
way
into
the
city
this
suggestion
of
martha
merrick
regarding
his
inattention
to
duty
to
his
beloved
nieces
was
no
easy
nut
to
crack
he
knew
his
to
be
a
frivolous
woman
with
many
trivial
ambitions
but
in
this
instance
he
had
misgivings
that
she
might
be
right
what
did
he
john
merrick
know
of
select
society
a
poor
man
of
humble
origin
he
had
wandered
into
the
infantile
embryo
west
years
ago
and
there
amassed
a
fortune
when
he
retired
and
returned
to
civilization
he
found
his
greatest
reward
in
the
discovery
of
three
charming
nieces
all
as
poor
as
job
turkey
but
struggling
along
bravely
each
in
her
individual
characteristic
way
and
well
worthy
their
doting
uncle
affectionate
admiration
merrick
had
recited
some
of
the
advantages
they
had
derived
from
the
advent
of
this
rich
relative
but
even
she
could
not
guess
how
devoted
the
man
was
to
the
welfare
of
these
three
fortunate
girls
nor
how
his
kindly
simple
heart
resented
the
insinuation
that
he
was
neglecting
anything
that
might
contribute
to
their
happiness
possession
of
money
had
never
altered
john
merrick
native
simplicity
he
had
no
extravagant
tastes
dressed
quietly
and
lived
the
life
of
the
people
on
this
eventful
morning
the
man
of
millions
took
a
car
to
the
elevated
station
and
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
train
once
seated
and
headed
cityward
he
took
out
his
memorandum
book
to
see
what
engagements
he
had
for
the
day
there
were
three
for
the
afternoon
at
twelve
he
had
promised
to
meet
von
taer
von
taer
gazing
reflectively
from
the
window
he
remembered
a
conversation
with
a
prominent
banker
some
month
or
so
before
von
taer
the
banker
had
said
is
an
aristocrat
with
an
independent
fortune
who
clings
to
the
brokerage
business
because
he
inherited
it
from
his
father
and
grandfather
i
hold
that
such
a
man
has
no
moral
right
to
continue
in
business
he
should
retire
and
give
the
other
fellow
a
chance
why
do
you
call
him
an
aristocrat
merrick
had
enquired
because
his
family
is
so
ancient
that
it
shames
the
ark
itself
i
imagine
his
ancestors
might
have
furnished
noah
the
lumber
to
build
his
ship
in
new
york
the
all
kowtow
to
von
taer
seems
to
me
he
has
the
right
to
be
a
broker
if
he
wants
to
asserted
merrick
the
right
yes
but
between
us
merrick
this
society
swell
has
no
mental
capacity
to
handle
such
an
uncertain
business
he
noted
for
doing
unwarranted
things
to
me
it
a
marvel
that
von
taer
shipwrecked
the
family
fortunes
long
ago
luck
has
saved
him
not
foresight
that
speech
of
a
few
weeks
ago
now
seemed
prophetic
to
john
merrick
within
a
few
days
the
aristocratic
broker
had
encountered
financial
difficulties
and
been
forced
to
appeal
to
merrick
to
whom
he
obtained
an
introduction
through
a
mutual
friend
von
taer
was
doubtless
solvent
for
he
controlled
large
means
but
unless
a
saving
hand
was
extended
at
this
juncture
his
losses
were
sure
to
be
severe
and
might
even
cripple
him
seriously
all
this
merrick
shrewdly
considered
in
the
space
of
a
few
moments
as
he
left
the
train
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
it
was
barely
eleven
he
decided
not
to
await
the
hour
of
appointment
with
his
usual
brisk
stride
he
walked
to
von
taer
offices
and
was
promptly
admitted
to
the
broker
sanctum
hedrik
von
taer
was
a
fine
looking
man
tall
grave
of
dignified
demeanor
and
courteous
manners
he
stood
until
his
visitor
was
seated
and
with
a
gesture
of
deference
invited
him
to
open
the
conversation
i
decided
to
make
you
the
loan
von
taer
began
merrick
in
his
practical
way
three
hundred
thousand
was
it
call
on
major
doyle
at
my
office
this
afternoon
and
he
arrange
it
for
you
an
expression
of
relief
crossed
the
broker
face
you
are
very
kind
sir
he
answered
i
assure
you
i
fully
appreciate
the
accommodation
glad
to
help
you
responded
the
millionaire
briskly
then
he
paused
with
marked
abruptness
it
occurred
to
him
he
had
a
difficult
proposition
to
make
to
this
man
to
avoid
the
cold
enquiring
eyes
now
fixed
upon
him
he
pulled
out
a
cigar
and
deliberately
cut
the
end
von
taer
furnished
him
a
match
he
smoked
a
while
in
silence
this
loan
sir
he
finally
began
is
freely
made
there
are
no
strings
tied
to
it
i
do
want
you
to
feel
i
demanding
any
sort
of
return
but
the
truth
is
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
grant
me
a
favor
von
taer
bowed
merrick
has
generously
placed
me
under
an
obligation
it
will
afford
me
pleasure
to
repay
said
he
but
his
eyes
held
an
uneasy
look
nevertheless
it
this
way
explained
the
other
i
three
nieces
fine
girls
von
taer
who
will
some
day
inherit
my
money
they
are
already
independent
financially
and
they
educated
and
amiable
young
women
take
my
word
for
it
i
am
sure
your
statements
are
justified
mr
merrick
yet
hedrik
von
taer
face
usually
unexpressive
denoted
blank
mystification
what
connection
could
these
girls
have
with
the
favor
to
be
demanded
got
any
girls
yourself
von
taer
a
daughter
sir
my
only
child
grown
up
a
young
lady
now
sir
then
you
understand
i
a
plain
uneducated
man
myself
never
been
any
nearer
swell
society
than
a
fifth
avenue
stage
my
money
has
given
me
commercial
position
but
no
social
one
worth
mentioning
your
a
bunch
i
ca
break
into
nohow
a
slight
smile
hovered
over
the
other
lips
but
he
quickly
controlled
it
they
tell
me
though
continued
the
speaker
that
family
has
long
ago
climbed
into
the
top
notch
of
society
you
one
o
the
big
guns
in
the
battery
an
hold
the
fort
against
all
comers
von
taer
merely
bowed
it
was
scarcely
necessary
to
either
admit
or
contradict
the
statement
uncle
john
was
a
little
indignant
that
his
companion
showed
no
disposition
to
assist
him
in
his
explanation
which
a
clear
head
might
now
easily
comprehend
so
with
his
usual
frankness
he
went
directly
to
the
point
i
like
my
girls
to
get
into
the
best
the
most
select
circles
he
announced
they
good
and
pretty
and
so
it
strikes
me
they
entitled
to
the
best
there
is
i
do
want
to
mix
with
your
swell
crowd
myself
because
i
ai
fit
likewise
the
outfit
much
to
my
taste
askin
your
pardon
but
with
women
it
different
they
need
to
stand
high
an
shine
bright
to
make
really
happy
and
if
any
special
lot
is
particularly
an
the
crowd
they
long
to
swarm
with
it
human
nature
female
human
nature
anyhow
you
catch
my
idea
von
taer
do
you
i
think
so
merrick
yet
i
fail
to
see
how
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
in
gratifying
the
ambition
of
your
charming
nieces
then
go
and
you
may
forget
what
i
said
the
visitor
arose
and
took
his
hat
from
the
table
it
was
only
a
fool
notion
anyway
just
a
thought
badly
expressed
to
help
my
girls
to
a
toy
that
money
ca
buy
hedrik
von
taer
gazed
steadily
into
the
man
face
there
was
something
in
the
simple
honest
of
this
wealthy
and
important
person
that
won
the
respect
of
all
he
met
the
broker
stern
eyes
softened
a
bit
as
he
gazed
and
he
allowed
a
fugitive
smile
due
to
his
own
change
of
attitude
to
wreathe
his
thin
lips
again
just
for
an
instant
sit
down
please
merrick
he
requested
and
rather
reluctantly
uncle
john
resumed
his
seat
you
may
not
have
an
especially
clear
idea
of
new
york
society
and
i
want
to
explain
my
recent
remark
so
that
you
will
understand
it
what
is
called
may
or
may
not
exist
but
certainly
it
is
no
distinct
league
or
association
it
may
perhaps
be
regarded
as
a
figure
of
speech
to
indicate
how
few
are
really
admitted
to
the
most
exclusive
circles
moreover
there
can
be
no
dominant
of
society
here
for
the
reason
that
not
all
grades
of
society
would
recognize
the
supremacy
of
any
one
set
or
clique
these
cliques
exist
for
various
reasons
they
fraternize
generally
but
keep
well
within
their
own
circles
kindred
tastes
attract
some
ancient
lineage
others
there
is
an
set
a
sporting
set
a
literary
set
an
aristocratic
set
a
rather
set
a
theatrical
set
and
so
on
these
may
all
lay
claim
with
certain
justice
to
membership
in
good
society
their
circles
are
to
an
extent
exclusive
because
some
distinction
must
mark
the
eligibility
of
members
and
outside
each
luminous
sphere
hovers
a
multitude
eager
to
pass
the
charmed
circle
and
so
acquire
recognition
often
it
is
hard
to
separate
the
initiate
from
the
uninitiate
even
by
those
most
expert
is
it
difficult
to
comprehend
such
a
condition
as
i
have
described
mr
merrick
somewhat
mr
von
taer
the
wonder
to
me
is
why
people
waste
time
in
such
foolishness
it
is
the
legitimate
occupation
of
many
the
folly
of
unwise
ambition
impels
others
there
is
a
fascination
about
social
life
that
appeals
to
the
majority
of
natures
let
us
compare
society
to
a
mountain
whose
sides
are
a
steep
incline
difficult
to
mount
to
stand
upon
the
summit
to
become
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
is
a
desire
inherent
seemingly
in
all
humanity
for
humanity
loves
distinction
in
the
scramble
toward
the
peak
many
fall
by
the
wayside
others
deceive
themselves
by
imagining
they
have
attained
the
apex
when
they
are
far
from
it
it
is
a
game
merrick
just
as
business
is
a
game
politics
a
game
and
war
a
game
you
know
how
few
really
win
here
said
uncle
john
musingly
is
a
philosophy
i
did
not
expect
from
you
von
taer
they
tell
me
you
one
who
stands
on
top
the
peak
and
you
were
born
that
way
and
did
have
to
climb
seems
to
me
you
rather
scorn
the
crowd
that
trying
to
climb
to
an
eminence
you
never
had
to
win
that
would
be
my
way
and
i
suspect
that
if
the
crowd
was
trying
to
climb
to
you
your
own
position
would
be
worth
a
cotton
hat
von
taer
had
no
answer
to
this
criticism
perhaps
he
scarcely
heard
it
for
he
appeared
lost
in
a
brown
study
finally
he
said
will
you
permit
my
daughter
to
call
upon
your
nieces
mr
merrick
of
course
sir
then
kindly
give
me
their
addresses
uncle
john
wrote
them
on
a
slip
of
paper
you
may
now
dismiss
the
subject
from
your
mind
sir
as
you
lately
advised
me
to
do
whatever
may
be
accomplished
in
the
direction
you
have
suggested
i
will
gladly
undertake
if
i
succeed
it
will
be
exceedingly
gratifying
to
us
all
i
am
sure
merrick
left
the
office
in
a
rather
humbled
and
testy
mood
he
disliked
to
ask
favors
at
any
time
and
now
felt
that
he
had
confided
himself
to
the
mercy
of
this
callous
aristocrat
and
met
with
a
distinct
rebuff
but
he
had
done
it
for
the
sake
of
his
beloved
nieces
and
they
would
never
know
what
humiliation
this
unsatisfactory
interview
had
cost
him
chapter
iii
diana
diana
von
taer
can
not
be
called
a
type
she
was
individual
aristocratic
to
her
finger
tips
she
was
unlike
all
other
aristocrats
an
admitted
queen
of
society
her
subjects
were
few
and
indifferent
she
possessed
ancient
lineage
was
highly
accomplished
had
been
born
to
the
purple
as
the
saying
is
but
none
of
these
things
conspired
to
make
her
the
curious
creature
she
was
as
we
make
her
acquaintance
she
is
years
of
age
and
looks
eighteen
she
is
tall
and
slender
and
carries
her
handsome
form
with
exquisite
grace
diana
is
never
abrupt
her
voice
is
ever
modulated
to
soft
even
tones
she
rises
from
a
chair
or
couch
with
the
lithe
sinuous
motion
of
a
serpent
uncoiling
her
face
critically
regarded
is
not
so
admirable
as
her
form
the
features
are
a
trifle
too
elongated
and
their
delicacy
is
marred
by
a
nose
a
bit
broad
and
unshapely
and
a
mouth
with
thin
lips
primly
set
her
dark
eyes
might
be
magnificent
if
wide
open
but
through
the
narrow
slits
of
their
lids
half
hidden
by
long
curling
lashes
the
eyes
peer
at
you
with
a
cold
watchful
intent
gaze
that
carries
a
certain
uncanny
and
disconcerting
fascination
yet
the
girl
is
essentially
feminine
if
you
refrain
from
meeting
that
discomfiting
gaze
and
her
familiars
have
learned
to
avoid
it
diana
impresses
you
as
being
graceful
dainty
and
possessed
of
charming
manners
her
taste
in
dress
is
perfect
she
converses
fluently
on
many
topics
it
is
her
custom
to
rise
at
ten
whatever
time
she
may
have
retired
the
night
before
to
read
until
luncheon
to
devote
the
remainder
of
her
day
to
the
requirements
of
society
eligible
young
men
of
admitted
social
standing
call
upon
diana
at
such
intervals
as
the
proprieties
require
they
chatter
small
talk
and
are
careful
to
address
her
with
deference
with
an
exception
to
be
referred
to
later
these
young
men
have
no
more
thought
of
flirting
with
miss
von
taer
than
they
would
with
the
statue
of
the
goddess
her
namesake
her
dinner
parties
and
entertainments
are
very
successful
she
is
greatly
admired
but
has
no
intimate
friends
when
her
mother
died
some
years
before
an
aunt
had
come
to
live
with
diana
and
now
posed
as
her
chaperon
cameron
was
a
stolid
corpulent
lady
with
a
countenance
perpetually
placid
and
an
habitual
aversion
to
displaying
intellect
her
presence
in
the
establishment
although
necessary
was
frankly
ignored
fortunately
she
never
obtruded
herself
hedrik
von
taer
was
passionately
devoted
to
his
daughter
he
alone
perhaps
of
all
the
world
thoroughly
understood
her
and
appreciated
her
talents
she
may
have
frightened
him
at
times
but
that
only
added
to
his
admiration
in
return
diana
displayed
a
calm
but
affectionate
regard
for
her
father
often
after
dinner
these
two
would
pass
an
hour
together
in
a
corner
of
the
where
the
cold
gray
eyes
of
the
man
met
the
intent
glance
of
the
girl
with
perfect
understanding
they
talked
of
many
things
including
business
hedrik
had
no
secrets
from
his
daughter
the
desperate
condition
of
his
finances
when
he
had
been
caught
in
a
corner
on
wheat
and
nearly
crushed
had
not
dismayed
her
in
the
least
it
was
she
who
had
counseled
him
to
appeal
to
john
merrick
since
the
name
and
fame
of
the
eccentric
millionaire
were
familiar
to
her
as
to
him
he
related
to
diana
his
interview
with
merrick
on
his
return
home
he
was
saved
the
three
hundred
thousand
were
now
in
the
bank
to
his
credit
and
he
could
weather
the
coming
storm
easily
perhaps
with
profit
in
a
tone
half
amused
half
serious
he
told
her
of
the
little
millionaire
desire
to
secure
into
good
society
for
his
three
nieces
diana
laughed
with
her
lips
her
eyes
never
laughed
then
she
took
in
her
hand
the
paper
containing
the
addresses
of
the
three
girls
and
regarded
it
thoughtfully
it
is
a
curious
request
she
said
in
her
soft
even
tones
but
one
we
can
not
diplomatically
disregard
provided
however
yes
diana
as
she
paused
provided
these
prospective
are
not
wholly
impossible
i
realize
that
returned
her
father
john
merrick
is
a
great
power
in
the
city
he
has
been
useful
to
me
and
may
be
again
i
have
this
chance
to
win
him
but
the
man
is
very
common
clay
despite
his
wealth
and
his
three
nieces
are
likely
to
be
made
of
the
same
material
should
they
prove
impossible
you
can
not
well
descend
to
introducing
them
to
our
set
i
am
not
certain
of
that
sir
said
the
girl
with
a
pretty
shrug
my
position
is
too
secure
to
be
jeopardized
by
any
error
of
this
sort
i
believe
i
may
introduce
these
girls
without
risk
i
shall
not
vouch
for
them
too
strongly
and
after
their
debut
they
must
stand
or
fall
on
their
own
merits
it
is
something
a
von
taer
has
never
yet
done
remarked
the
man
gravely
to
commercialize
his
social
position
but
father
dear
the
age
is
fast
commercializing
everything
i
think
our
especial
set
is
as
yet
comparatively
free
from
contamination
by
the
rich
but
even
among
us
money
has
glossed
many
offenses
that
a
generation
ago
would
have
meant
social
ostracism
he
nodded
that
is
true
diana
life
with
me
is
a
bit
dull
as
well
everlasting
routine
however
admirable
is
tiresome
i
scent
amusement
in
this
adventure
which
i
have
decided
to
undertake
with
your
permission
i
will
see
these
girls
and
quickly
decide
their
fate
should
they
prove
not
too
dreadfully
you
may
look
to
see
them
my
especial
i
leave
all
to
your
discretion
diana
returned
von
taer
with
a
sigh
if
in
the
end
some
of
the
more
particular
venture
to
reproach
them
it
will
not
matter
interrupted
the
daughter
lightly
as
her
dark
eyes
narrowed
to
a
hair
breadth
any
who
dares
reproach
diana
von
taer
will
afford
her
interesting
occupation
and
to
offset
that
remote
contingency
we
shall
permanently
enslave
the
powerful
john
merrick
i
understand
he
is
hard
as
nails
in
financial
matters
but
to
us
the
man
has
disclosed
his
one
weakness
ambition
to
promote
his
three
nieces
since
we
have
discovered
this
vulnerable
point
let
us
take
advantage
of
it
i
am
satisfied
the
loan
of
three
hundred
thousand
was
but
a
lure
and
how
cleverly
the
man
gauged
us
von
taer
scowled
get
your
wraps
diana
the
carriage
is
waiting
and
we
are
due
at
doldringham
crush
chapter
iv
the
three
nieces
the
von
taers
did
not
affect
motor
cars
in
some
circles
the
carriage
and
pair
is
still
considered
the
more
aristocratic
mode
of
conveyance
established
customs
do
not
readily
give
way
to
fads
and
freaks
consulting
her
memoranda
as
she
rode
along
in
her
handsome
tastefully
appointed
equipage
diana
found
that
louise
merrick
one
of
the
three
girls
she
had
set
out
to
discover
was
the
nearest
on
her
route
presently
she
rang
the
bell
at
the
merrick
residence
an
eminently
respectable
dwelling
in
a
desirable
neighborhood
diana
could
not
resist
a
sigh
of
relief
as
her
observant
glance
noted
this
detail
a
dignified
butler
ushered
her
into
a
reception
room
and
departed
with
her
card
it
was
now
that
the
visitor
nose
took
an
upward
tendency
as
she
critically
examined
her
surroundings
the
furnishings
were
abominable
a
mixture
of
distressingly
new
articles
with
those
evidently
procured
from
dealers
in
antiquities
money
had
been
lavished
here
but
good
taste
was
absent
to
understand
this
for
miss
von
taer
gauged
the
condition
truly
it
is
necessary
to
know
something
of
martha
merrick
this
lady
the
relict
of
john
merrick
only
brother
was
endowed
with
a
mediocre
mind
and
a
towering
ambition
when
left
a
widow
with
an
only
daughter
she
had
schemed
and
contrived
in
endless
ways
to
maintain
an
appearance
of
competency
on
a
meager
income
finally
she
divided
her
capital
derived
from
her
husband
life
insurance
into
three
equal
parts
which
she
determined
to
squander
in
three
years
in
an
attempt
to
hoodwink
the
world
with
the
belief
that
she
was
wealthy
before
the
three
years
were
ended
her
daughter
louise
would
be
twenty
and
by
that
time
she
must
have
secured
a
rich
and
been
safely
married
in
return
for
this
sacrifice
the
girl
was
to
see
that
her
mother
was
made
comfortable
thereafter
this
worldly
and
foolish
design
was
confided
to
louise
when
she
was
only
seventeen
and
her
unformed
mind
easily
absorbed
her
mother
silly
ambition
it
was
a
pity
for
louise
merrick
possessed
a
nature
sweet
and
lovable
as
well
as
instinctively
refined
a
nature
derived
from
her
dead
father
and
with
little
true
sympathy
with
unscrupulous
schemes
but
at
that
age
a
girl
is
easily
influenced
so
it
is
little
wonder
that
under
such
tuition
louise
became
calculating
sly
and
deceitful
to
a
most
deplorable
degree
such
acquired
traits
bade
fair
in
the
end
to
defeat
carefully
planned
for
the
daughter
had
a
premature
love
affair
with
a
youth
outside
the
pale
of
eligibility
louise
ignored
the
fact
that
he
had
been
disinherited
by
his
father
and
in
her
reckless
infatuation
would
have
sacrificed
her
mother
without
thought
or
remorse
the
dreadful
finale
had
only
been
averted
by
the
advent
of
uncle
john
merrick
who
had
changed
the
life
plans
of
the
widow
and
her
heedless
daughter
and
promptly
saved
the
situation
john
merrick
did
not
like
his
but
he
was
charmed
by
his
lovely
niece
and
took
her
at
once
to
his
affectionate
old
heart
he
saw
the
faults
of
louise
clearly
but
also
appreciated
her
sweeter
qualities
under
his
skillful
guidance
she
soon
redeemed
herself
and
regained
control
of
her
better
nature
the
girl
was
not
yet
perfect
by
any
means
she
was
to
an
extent
artificial
and
secretive
and
her
thoughtless
flirtations
were
far
from
wise
but
her
two
cousins
and
her
uncle
had
come
to
know
and
understand
her
good
points
they
not
only
bore
patiently
with
her
volatile
nature
but
strove
to
influence
her
to
demonstrate
her
inherent
good
qualities
in
one
way
her
mother
calculating
training
had
been
most
effective
louise
was
not
only
a
dainty
lovely
maid
to
the
eye
but
her
manners
were
gracious
and
winning
and
she
had
that
admirable
which
quickly
endears
one
even
to
casual
acquaintances
she
did
not
impress
more
intimate
friends
as
being
wholly
sincere
yet
there
was
nothing
in
her
acts
since
that
one
escapade
referred
to
that
merited
severe
disapproval
of
course
the
brilliant
idea
of
foisting
her
precious
daughter
upon
the
select
society
of
the
metropolis
was
original
with
merrick
louise
was
well
content
with
things
as
they
were
but
not
so
the
mother
the
rise
from
poverty
to
affluence
the
removal
of
all
cares
and
burdens
from
her
mind
had
merely
fostered
still
greater
ambitions
uncle
john
generosity
had
endowed
each
of
his
three
nieces
with
an
ample
fortune
i
want
to
enjoy
the
good
things
of
life
while
they
at
an
age
to
enjoy
he
said
for
the
older
one
gets
the
fewer
things
are
found
to
be
enjoyable
that
my
experience
anyhow
he
also
told
the
girls
frankly
that
they
were
to
inherit
jointly
although
not
equally
his
entire
fortune
yet
even
this
glowing
prospect
did
not
satisfy
merrick
since
all
her
plans
for
louise
from
the
very
beginning
had
been
founded
on
personal
selfishness
she
now
proposed
to
have
her
daughter
gain
admission
to
recognized
fashionable
society
in
order
that
she
might
herself
bask
in
the
reflection
of
the
glory
so
obtained
and
take
her
place
with
the
proud
matrons
who
formed
the
keystone
of
such
society
after
carefully
considering
ways
and
means
to
gain
her
object
she
had
finally
conceived
the
idea
of
utilizing
merrick
she
well
knew
uncle
john
would
not
consider
one
niece
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
and
had
therefore
used
his
influence
to
get
all
three
girls
properly
introduced
therefore
her
delight
and
excitement
were
intense
when
the
butler
brought
up
diana
card
and
she
realized
that
the
perfectly
swell
miss
von
taer
was
seated
in
her
reception
room
she
rushed
to
louise
who
wholly
innocent
of
any
knowledge
of
the
intrigue
which
had
led
to
this
climax
opened
her
blue
eyes
in
astonishment
and
said
with
a
gasp
oh
mother
what
shall
i
do
do
why
go
down
and
make
yourself
agreeable
of
course
it
your
chance
my
dear
your
great
chance
in
life
go
go
do
for
sake
keep
her
waiting
louise
went
down
in
her
most
affable
and
gracious
way
she
approached
the
visitor
and
said
it
is
very
nice
of
you
to
call
upon
me
i
am
glad
to
meet
miss
von
taer
diana
passing
conversational
nothings
with
the
young
girl
was
pleased
by
her
appearance
and
this
aspirant
for
social
honors
was
fresh
fair
and
attractive
with
a
flow
of
small
talk
at
her
tongue
end
really
thought
the
fastidious
visitor
this
one
at
least
will
do
me
no
discredit
if
she
is
a
fair
sample
of
the
others
we
shall
get
along
very
nicely
in
this
enterprise
to
louise
she
said
before
going
i
to
have
an
evening
the
nineteenth
will
you
assist
me
to
receive
now
that
we
are
acquainted
i
wish
to
see
more
of
you
my
dear
and
i
predict
we
shall
get
along
famously
together
the
girl
head
swam
help
miss
von
taer
to
receive
such
an
honor
had
been
undreamed
of
an
hour
ago
but
she
held
her
natural
agitation
under
good
control
and
only
a
round
red
spot
upon
each
cheek
betrayed
her
inward
excitement
as
she
prettily
accepted
the
invitation
beneath
their
drooping
lashes
diana
sagacious
eyes
read
the
thoughts
of
the
girl
quite
accurately
miss
von
taer
enjoyed
disconcerting
anyone
in
any
way
and
louise
was
so
simple
and
unsophisticated
that
she
promised
to
afford
considerable
amusement
in
the
future
by
the
time
diana
had
finished
her
brief
call
this
singular
creature
had
taken
the
measure
of
louise
merrick
in
every
detail
including
her
assumption
of
lightness
and
her
various
frivolities
she
understood
that
in
the
girl
were
capabilities
for
good
or
for
evil
as
she
might
be
led
by
a
stronger
will
and
musingly
diana
wondered
who
would
lead
her
as
for
louise
she
was
enraptured
by
her
distinguished
condescension
and
patronage
and
her
heart
bounded
at
the
thought
of
being
admitted
to
the
envied
social
coterie
in
which
diana
von
taer
shone
a
bright
particular
star
the
second
name
in
the
list
of
john
merrick
nieces
was
that
of
elizabeth
de
graf
she
lived
at
a
good
private
hotel
located
in
an
exclusive
residence
district
it
was
true
that
elizabeth
or
beth
as
she
was
more
familiarly
called
was
not
a
permanent
guest
at
this
hotel
when
in
new
york
she
was
accustomed
to
live
with
one
or
the
other
of
her
cousins
who
welcomed
her
eagerly
but
just
now
her
mother
had
journeyed
from
the
old
ohio
home
to
visit
beth
and
the
girl
had
no
intention
of
inflicting
her
parent
upon
the
other
girls
therefore
she
had
taken
rooms
at
the
hotel
temporarily
and
the
plan
suited
her
mother
excellently
for
one
thing
de
graf
could
go
home
and
tell
her
cloverton
gossips
that
she
had
stopped
at
the
most
fashionable
hotel
in
new
york
a
second
point
was
that
she
loved
to
feast
with
epicurean
avidity
upon
the
products
of
a
clever
being
one
of
those
women
who
live
to
eat
rather
than
eat
to
live
de
graf
was
john
merrick
only
surviving
sister
but
she
differed
as
widely
from
the
simple
kindly
man
in
disposition
as
did
her
ingenious
daughter
from
her
in
mental
attainments
the
father
professor
de
graf
was
supposed
to
be
a
musical
genius
before
beth
came
into
her
money
through
uncle
john
the
professor
taught
the
piano
and
singing
now
however
the
daughter
allowed
her
parents
a
liberal
income
and
the
musician
devoted
himself
to
composing
oratorios
and
concertas
which
no
one
but
himself
would
ever
play
to
be
quite
frank
the
girl
cared
little
for
her
gross
and
selfish
parents
and
they
in
turn
cared
little
for
her
beyond
the
value
she
afforded
them
in
the
way
of
dollars
and
cents
so
she
had
not
lived
at
home
where
constant
quarrels
and
bickerings
nearly
drove
her
frantic
since
uncle
john
had
adopted
her
in
catering
to
this
present
whim
of
her
mother
who
longed
to
spend
a
few
luxurious
weeks
in
new
york
beth
sacrificed
more
than
might
be
imagined
by
one
unacquainted
with
her
sad
family
history
whimsical
major
doyle
often
called
uncle
john
nieces
the
three
graces
but
beth
was
by
odds
the
beauty
of
them
all
splendid
brown
eyes
added
to
an
exquisite
complexion
almost
faultless
features
and
a
superb
carriage
rendered
this
fair
young
girl
distinguished
in
any
throng
fortunately
she
was
as
yet
quite
unspoiled
being
saved
from
vanity
by
a
morbid
consciousness
of
her
inborn
failings
and
a
sincere
loathing
for
the
moral
weakness
that
prevented
her
from
correcting
those
faults
judging
beth
by
the
common
standard
of
girls
of
her
age
both
failings
and
faults
were
more
imaginary
than
real
yet
it
was
her
characteristic
to
suspect
and
despise
in
herself
such
weaknesses
as
others
would
condone
or
at
least
regard
leniently
for
here
was
a
girl
true
and
staunch
incapable
of
intrigue
or
deceit
frank
and
outspoken
all
these
qualities
having
been
proven
more
than
once
everyone
loved
beth
de
graf
save
herself
and
at
this
stage
of
her
development
the
influence
of
her
cousins
and
of
uncle
john
had
conspired
to
make
the
supersensitive
girl
more
tolerant
of
herself
and
less
morbid
than
formerly
i
think
beth
knew
of
diana
von
taer
for
the
latter
portrait
frequently
graced
the
society
columns
of
the
new
york
press
and
at
times
the
three
nieces
in
confidential
mood
would
canvass
diana
and
her
social
exploits
as
they
did
the
acts
of
other
famous
personages
but
the
girl
had
never
dreamed
of
meeting
such
a
celebrity
and
miss
von
taer
card
filled
her
with
curious
wonder
as
to
the
errand
that
had
brought
her
the
de
grafs
lived
at
the
hotel
for
beth
had
determined
to
surround
her
sybaritic
mother
with
all
attainable
luxury
since
the
child
frequently
reproached
herself
with
feeling
a
distinct
repulsion
for
the
poor
woman
so
diana
was
ushered
into
a
pretty
parlor
where
beth
stood
calmly
awaiting
her
the
two
regarded
one
another
in
silence
a
moment
miss
de
graf
frank
eyes
covering
the
other
with
a
comprehensive
sweep
while
miss
von
narrowed
gaze
profoundly
observant
studied
the
beautiful
girl
before
her
with
that
impenetrable
gleam
that
precluded
any
solution
miss
von
taer
i
believe
said
beth
quietly
glancing
at
the
card
she
held
will
you
be
seated
diana
sank
gracefully
into
a
chair
the
sinuous
motion
attracted
attention
and
gave
her
a
slight
shiver
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
my
dear
began
the
visitor
in
soft
purring
accents
i
have
long
promised
myself
the
pleasure
of
a
call
and
in
spite
of
many
procrastinations
at
last
have
accomplished
my
ambition
beth
resented
the
affectation
of
this
prelude
and
slightly
frowned
diana
was
watching
she
always
watched
why
should
you
wish
to
call
upon
me
was
the
frank
demand
do
not
think
me
rude
please
but
i
am
scarcely
in
a
position
to
become
a
desirable
acquaintance
of
miss
von
taer
the
tone
was
a
trifle
bitter
and
diana
noted
it
a
subtile
antagonism
seemed
springing
up
between
them
and
the
more
experienced
girl
scented
in
this
danger
to
her
plans
she
must
handle
this
young
lady
more
cautiously
than
she
had
louise
merrick
your
position
is
unimpeachable
my
dear
was
the
response
you
are
john
merrick
niece
beth
was
really
angry
now
she
scowled
and
it
spoiled
her
beauty
diana
took
warning
and
began
to
think
quickly
i
referred
to
my
social
position
miss
von
taer
our
family
is
honest
enough
thank
god
but
it
has
never
been
accepted
in
what
is
termed
select
society
diana
laughed
a
quiet
rippling
laugh
as
icy
as
a
brook
in
november
but
as
near
gaiety
as
she
could
at
the
moment
accomplish
when
she
laughed
this
way
her
eyes
nearly
closed
and
became
inscrutable
beth
had
a
feeling
of
repulsion
for
her
caller
but
strove
to
shake
it
off
miss
von
taer
was
nothing
to
her
could
be
nothing
to
her
your
uncle
is
a
very
wealthy
man
said
diana
with
easy
composure
he
has
made
you
an
heiress
placing
you
in
a
class
much
sought
after
in
these
mercenary
days
but
aside
from
that
my
dear
your
personal
accomplishments
have
not
escaped
notice
and
gossip
declares
you
to
be
a
very
fascinating
young
woman
as
well
as
beautiful
and
good
i
do
not
imagine
society
claims
to
be
of
divine
origin
but
were
it
so
no
one
is
more
qualified
to
grace
it
the
blandishments
of
this
speech
had
less
effect
upon
beth
than
the
evident
desire
to
please
she
began
to
feel
she
had
been
ungracious
and
straightway
adopted
a
more
cordial
tone
i
am
sure
you
mean
well
miss
von
taer
she
hastened
to
say
and
i
assure
you
i
am
not
ungrateful
but
it
occurred
to
me
we
could
have
nothing
in
common
oh
my
dear
you
wrong
us
both
do
you
know
my
uncle
enquired
beth
he
is
the
friend
of
my
father
hedrik
von
taer
our
family
owes
john
merrick
much
consideration
therefore
i
decided
to
seek
pleasure
in
the
acquaintance
of
his
nieces
the
words
and
tone
seemed
alike
candid
beth
began
to
relent
she
sat
down
for
the
first
time
taking
a
chair
opposite
diana
you
see
she
said
artlessly
i
have
no
personal
inclination
for
society
which
is
doubtless
so
large
a
part
of
your
own
amusement
it
seems
to
me
artificial
and
insipid
those
who
view
from
a
distance
the
husk
of
a
cocoanut
have
little
idea
of
the
milk
within
declared
diana
softly
true
answered
beth
but
i
cracked
cocoanuts
and
sometimes
found
the
milk
sour
and
tainted
the
difference
you
observe
in
cocoanuts
is
to
be
found
in
the
various
grades
of
society
these
are
not
all
insipid
and
artificial
i
assure
you
they
may
be
worse
remarked
beth
i
heard
strange
tales
of
your
orgies
diana
was
really
amused
this
girl
was
proving
more
interesting
than
the
first
niece
she
had
interviewed
unaccustomed
to
seeking
acquaintances
outside
her
own
exclusive
circle
and
under
such
circumstances
these
meetings
were
to
her
in
the
nature
of
an
adventure
a
creature
of
powerful
likes
and
dislikes
she
already
hated
beth
most
heartily
but
for
that
very
reason
she
insisted
on
cultivating
her
further
acquaintance
you
must
not
judge
society
by
the
mad
pranks
of
a
few
of
its
members
she
responded
in
her
most
agreeable
manner
if
we
are
not
to
set
an
example
in
decorum
to
the
rest
of
the
world
we
are
surely
unfitted
to
occupy
the
high
place
accorded
us
but
you
must
see
and
decide
for
yourself
i
no
indeed
ah
do
not
decide
hastily
my
dear
let
me
become
your
sponsor
for
a
short
time
until
you
really
discover
what
society
is
like
then
you
may
act
upon
more
mature
judgment
i
do
not
understand
you
miss
von
taer
then
i
will
be
more
explicit
i
am
to
receive
a
few
friends
at
my
home
on
the
evening
of
the
nineteenth
will
you
be
my
guest
beth
was
puzzled
how
to
answer
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
that
perhaps
uncle
john
would
like
her
to
be
courteous
to
his
friend
daughter
and
that
argument
decided
her
she
accepted
the
invitation
i
want
you
to
receive
with
me
continued
diana
rising
in
that
way
i
shall
be
able
to
introduce
you
to
my
friends
beth
wondered
at
this
condescension
but
consented
to
receive
she
was
annoyed
to
think
how
completely
she
had
surrendered
to
the
will
of
miss
von
taer
for
whom
she
had
conceived
the
same
aversion
she
had
for
a
snake
she
estimated
diana
society
belle
though
she
was
to
be
sly
calculating
and
deceitful
worse
than
all
she
was
decidedly
clever
and
therefore
dangerous
nothing
good
could
come
of
an
acquaintance
with
her
beth
was
sure
yet
she
had
pledged
herself
to
meet
her
and
her
friends
the
nineteenth
lit
a
formal
society
function
how
much
beth
de
graf
misjudged
diana
von
taer
the
future
will
determine
the
interview
had
tired
diana
as
she
reentered
her
carriage
she
was
undecided
whether
to
go
home
or
hunt
up
the
third
niece
but
willing
square
was
not
five
minutes
drive
from
here
so
she
ordered
the
coachman
to
proceed
there
i
am
positively
out
of
my
element
in
this
affair
she
told
herself
for
it
is
more
difficult
to
cultivate
these
inexperienced
girls
than
i
had
thought
they
are
not
exactly
impossible
as
i
at
first
feared
but
they
are
so
wholly
unconventional
as
to
be
somewhat
embarrassing
as
analyzing
the
two
i
have
met
the
majority
one
strikes
me
as
being
transparently
affected
and
the
other
a
stubborn
attractive
fool
they
are
equally
untrained
in
diplomacy
and
unable
to
cover
their
real
feelings
here
am
i
practically
dragging
them
into
the
limelight
when
it
would
be
far
better
for
themselves
perhaps
for
me
that
they
remained
in
oblivion
ah
well
i
called
it
an
adventure
let
me
hope
some
tangible
plot
will
develop
to
compensate
me
for
my
trouble
life
seems
deadly
dull
i
need
excitement
is
it
to
be
furnished
by
john
merrick
nieces
i
wonder
willing
square
is
a
new
district
crowded
with
fashionable
apartment
houses
that
is
they
are
called
fashionable
by
their
builders
and
owners
and
accepted
as
such
by
their
fashionable
occupants
diana
knew
at
least
two
good
families
resident
in
willing
square
and
though
she
smiled
grimly
at
the
rows
of
oppressively
new
and
vulgar
buildings
she
still
was
not
ashamed
to
have
her
equipage
seen
waiting
there
number
willing
square
is
a
very
substantial
and
cozy
appearing
apartment
building
owned
in
fee
by
miss
patricia
doyle
diana
was
unaware
of
this
fact
but
rang
the
doyle
bell
and
ascended
to
the
second
floor
a
maid
received
her
with
the
announcement
that
miss
doyle
had
just
stepped
out
but
was
somewhere
in
the
building
would
the
visitor
care
to
wait
a
few
minutes
yes
diana
decided
she
would
wait
she
took
a
seat
in
the
snug
front
parlor
and
from
her
position
noted
the
series
of
rooms
that
opened
one
into
another
throughout
the
suite
all
richly
but
tastefully
furnished
in
homely
unassuming
manner
this
is
better
she
mused
there
is
no
attempt
at
foolish
display
in
this
establishment
at
any
rate
i
hope
to
find
miss
doyle
a
sensible
refined
person
the
name
is
irish
a
door
slammed
somewhere
down
the
line
of
rooms
and
a
voice
cried
in
excited
tones
i
found
a
baby
hi
there
nunkie
dear
i
found
a
baby
thereupon
came
the
sound
of
a
chair
being
pushed
back
as
a
man
voice
answered
in
equal
glee
why

little
rogue

bobby
darlin
a
babyish
voice
babbled
merrily
but
the
sounds
were
all
goos
and
ahs
without
any
resemblance
to
words
bobby
may
have
imagined
he
was
talking
but
he
was
not
very
intelligible
see
here
patsy
doyle

baby
cried
the
man
pleadingly
i
found

his
home

by
his
necktie
here

neigh

a
horse

a
horse
neigh
patsy
asked
a
muffled
voice
choking
and
chuckling
at
the
same
time
hee
hee
uncle
john
tried
to
neigh
and
made
a
sorry
mess
of
it
although
bobby
shrieked
with
delight
then
came
a
sudden
hush
diana
caught
the
maid
voice
perhaps
announcing
the
presence
of
a
visitor
for
patsy
cried
in
subdued
accents
goodness

so

baby

to
him
i
got
a
caller
diana
smiled
a
bit
scornfully
and
then
composed
her
features
as
a
young
girl
bustled
into
the
room
and
came
toward
her
with
frank
cordiality
indicated
in
the
wide
smile
and
hand
pardon
my
keeping
you
waiting
said
patsy
dropping
into
a
chair
opposite
her
visitor
uncle
john
and
i
were
romping
with
the
baby
from
upstarts
bobby
such
a
dear
i
did
quite
catch
the
name
mary
gave
me
and
forgot
to
look
at
your
card
i
am
miss
von
taer
not
diana
von
taer
the
swell
society
girl
cried
patsy
eagerly
diana
could
remember
when
she
had
been
so
completely
nonplused
before
after
an
involuntary
gasp
she
answered
quietly
i
am
diana
von
taer
well
i
glad
to
meet
you
just
the
same
said
patsy
cheerfully
we
outsiders
are
liable
to
look
on
society
folk
as
we
would
on
a
cage
of
monkeys
because
we
so
very
ignorant
you
know
and
the
bars
are
really
between
us
this
frank
disdain
verged
on
rudeness
although
the
girl
had
no
intention
of
being
rude
diana
was
annoyed
in
spite
of
her
desire
to
be
tolerant
perhaps
the
bars
are
imaginary
she
rejoined
carelessly
and
it
may
be
you
been
looking
at
the
and
not
at
the
entertainment
in
the
main
tent
will
you
admit
that
possibility
miss
doyle
patsy
laughed
gleefully
i
think
you
have
me
there
miss
von
taer
and
what
do
know
about
society
just
nothing
at
all
it
out
of
my
line
entirely
perhaps
it
is
was
the
slow
response
society
appeals
to
only
those
whose
tastes
seem
to
require
it
and
are
we
drawing
distinctions
enquired
miss
doyle
society
at
large
is
the
main
evidence
of
civilization
and
all
decent
folk
are
members
of
it
is
that
communism
asked
diana
perhaps
so
it
society
at
large
but
certain
classes
have
leagued
together
and
excluded
themselves
from
their
fellows
admitting
only
those
of
their
own
ilk
the
people
did
put
them
on
their
pedestals
they
put
themselves
there
yet
the
people
bow
down
and
worship
these
social
gods
and
seem
glad
to
have
them
the
newspapers
print
their
pictures
and
the
color
of
their
gowns
and
how
they
do
their
hair
and
what
they
eat
and
what
they
do
and
the
poor
washwomen
and
and
their
like
read
these
accounts
more
religiously
than
they
do
their
bibles
my
maid
mary
a
good
girl
but
she
grabs
the
society
sheet
of
the
sunday
paper
and
reads
it
from
top
to
bottom
i
never
look
at
it
myself
diana
cheeks
were
burning
she
naturally
resented
such
ridicule
having
been
born
to
regard
social
distinction
with
awe
and
reverence
inwardly
resolving
to
make
miss
patricia
doyle
regret
the
speech
she
hid
all
annoyance
under
her
admirable
and
answered
with
smooth
complacency
your
estimate
of
society
my
dear
miss
doyle
is
superficial
do
i
know
it
then
exclaimed
patsy
culture
and
breeding
similarity
of
taste
and
intellectual
pursuits
will
always
attract
certain
people
and
band
them
together
in
those
cliques
which
are
called
sets
they
are
not
secret
societies
they
have
no
rules
of
exclusion
congenial
minds
are
ever
welcome
to
their
ranks
this
is
a
natural
coalition
in
no
way
artificial
can
you
not
appreciate
that
miss
doyle
yes
indeed
admitted
patsy
promptly
you
quite
right
and
just
one
of
those
stupid
creatures
who
criticise
the
sun
because
a
cloud
before
it
probably
there
are
all
grades
of
society
because
there
are
all
grades
of
people
i
thought
you
would
agree
with
me
when
you
understood
murmured
diana
and
her
expression
was
so
smug
and
satisfied
that
patsy
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
spirit
of
mischief
and
have
i
seen
your
own
pictures
in
the
sunday
papers
she
asked
perhaps
if
you
robbed
your
maid
of
her
pleasure
and
very
pretty
pictures
they
were
too
they
showed
culture
and
breeding
all
right
and
the
latest
style
in
gowns
of
course
those
intellectual
in
your
set
did
need
an
introduction
to
you
you
were
advertised
as
an
example
of
perfection
to
spur
the
ambition
of
those
lower
down
in
the
social
scale
perhaps
a
good
thing
are
you
trying
to
annoy
me
demanded
diana
her
eyes
glaring
under
their
curling
lashes
dear
me
dear
me
cried
patsy
distressed
see
how
saucy
and
impudent
i
been
and
i
did
mean
a
bit
of
it
wo
you
forgive
me
please
miss
von
taer
there
we
begin
all
over
again
and
i
be
on
my
good
behavior
i
so
very
ignorant
you
know
diana
smiled
at
this
it
would
be
folly
to
show
resentment
to
such
a
childish
creature
unfortunately
she
said
i
have
been
unable
to
escape
the
vulgar
publicity
thrust
upon
me
by
the
newspapers
the
reporters
are
preying
vultures
rapacious
for
sensation
and
have
small
respect
for
anyone
i
am
sure
we
discourage
them
as
much
as
we
can
i
used
to
weep
with
mortification
when
i
found
myself
up
now
however
i
have
learned
to
bear
such
trials
with
fortitude
if
not
with
resignation
forgive
me
said
patsy
contritely
somehow
i
had
a
false
idea
of
these
things
if
i
knew
you
better
miss
von
taer
you
soon
convert
me
to
be
an
admirer
of
society
i
like
to
do
that
miss
doyle
for
you
interest
me
will
you
return
my
call
indeed
i
will
promised
the
girl
readily
i
flattered
that
you
called
on
me
at
all
miss
von
taer
for
you
might
easily
have
amused
yourself
better
you
must
be
very
busy
with
all
the
demands
society
makes
on
one
when
shall
i
come
make
it
some
off
time
when
we
wo
be
disturbed
diana
smiled
at
her
eagerness
how
nescient
the
poor
little
thing
was
your
cousins
miss
merrick
and
miss
de
graf
have
consented
to
receive
with
me
on
the
evening
of
the
nineteenth
will
you
not
join
us
louise
and
beth
cried
patsy
astounded
is
it
nice
of
them
and
may
i
count
upon
you
also
patsy
smiled
dubiously
into
the
other
face
let
me
out
of
it
she
said
ca
you
see
i
no
butterfly
diana
saw
many
things
having
taken
a
shrewd
account
of
the
girl
long
before
this
miss
patricia
doyle
was
short
and
plump
with
a
round
merry
face
covered
with
freckles
hair
indisputably
red
and
a
nose
also
she
possessed
a
pair
of
wonderful
blue
eyes
eyes
that
danced
and
scintillated
with
joyous
good
humor
eyes
so
captivating
that
few
ever
looked
beyond
them
or
noted
the
plain
face
they
glorified
but
the
critic
admitted
that
the
face
was
charmingly
expressive
the
sweet
and
sensitive
mouth
always
in
sympathy
with
the
twinkling
candid
eyes
life
and
energy
radiated
from
her
small
person
which
miss
von
taer
grudgingly
conceded
to
possess
unusual
fascination
here
was
a
creature
quite
imperfect
in
detail
yet
destined
to
allure
and
enchant
whomsoever
she
might
meet
all
this
was
quite
the
reverse
of
diana
own
frigid
personality
patsy
would
make
an
excellent
foil
for
her
as
you
please
my
dear
she
said
graciously
but
do
you
not
think
it
would
amuse
you
to
make
your
debut
in
society
unimpeachable
society
and
be
properly
introduced
to
the
occupants
of
the
as
your
cousins
will
be
patsy
reflected
if
beth
and
louise
had
determined
to
undertake
this
venture
why
should
she
hold
back
moreover
she
experienced
a
girlish
and
wholly
natural
curiosity
to
witness
a
fashionable
gathering
and
size
up
the
lions
for
herself
so
she
said
i
come
if
you
really
want
me
and
i
try
my
best
to
behave
nicely
but
i
ca
imagine
why
you
have
chosen
to
take
us
three
girls
under
your
wing
unless
with
sudden
intuition
it
for
uncle
sake
that
was
it
at
first
replied
diana
rising
to
go
but
now
that
seen
you
i
delighted
to
have
you
on
your
own
account
come
early
dear
we
must
be
ready
to
receive
our
guests
by
nine
nine
reflected
patsy
when
her
visitor
had
gone
why
often
in
bed
by
that
time
chapter
v
preparing
for
the
plunge
john
merrick
lived
with
the
doyles
at
their
willing
square
apartments
there
were
but
two
of
the
doyles
patricia
and
her
father
major
doyle
a
tall
handsome
soldierly
man
with
white
moustache
and
hair
the
major
was
noted
as
a
character
a
keen
wit
and
a
most
agreeable
type
of
the
old
irish
gentleman
he
fairly
worshipped
his
daughter
and
no
one
blamed
him
for
it
his
business
as
special
agent
and
manager
for
his
millions
kept
the
major
closely
occupied
and
afforded
john
merrick
opportunity
to
spend
his
days
as
be
pleased
the
rich
man
was
supposed
to
be
retired
yet
the
care
of
his
investments
and
income
was
no
light
task
as
the
major
found
we
are
accustomed
to
regard
extreme
wealth
as
the
result
of
shrewdness
not
wholly
divorced
from
unscrupulous
methods
yet
no
one
could
accuse
john
merrick
or
his
representative
with
being
other
than
kindly
and
honest
uncle
john
says
that
he
never
intended
to
get
rich
it
was
all
the
result
of
carelessness
he
had
been
so
immersed
in
business
that
he
failed
to
notice
how
fast
his
fortune
was
growing
when
he
awoke
to
a
realization
of
his
immense
accumulation
he
promptly
retired
appointing
major
doyle
to
look
after
his
investments
and
seeking
personal
leisure
after
many
years
of
hard
work
he
instructed
his
agent
to
keep
his
income
from
growing
into
more
capital
by
rendering
wise
assistance
to
all
worthy
charities
and
individuals
and
this
as
you
may
suppose
the
major
found
a
herculean
task
often
he
denounced
uncle
john
for
refusing
to
advise
him
claiming
that
the
millionaire
had
selfishly
thrust
the
burden
of
his
wealth
on
the
major
broad
shoulders
while
there
was
an
element
of
truth
in
this
the
burden
it
was
not
so
heavy
as
to
make
the
old
soldier
unhappy
and
the
two
men
loved
and
respected
one
another
with
manly
cordiality
patricia
was
recognized
as
uncle
john
favorite
niece
and
it
was
understood
she
was
to
inherit
the
bulk
of
his
property
although
some
millions
might
be
divided
between
beth
and
louise
if
they
married
wisely
neither
uncle
john
nor
the
major
ever
seemed
to
consider
patsy
marrying
she
was
such
a
child
that
wedlock
for
her
seemed
a
remote
possibility
the
sunday
afternoon
following
diana
von
taer
visit
to
the
three
nieces
found
the
girls
all
congregated
in
patsy
own
room
where
an
earnest
discussion
was
being
conducted
that
left
uncle
john
to
take
his
nap
in
the
big
morris
chair
in
the
living
room
where
major
doyle
sat
while
he
gazed
from
the
window
and
begrudged
the
moments
patsy
was
being
kept
from
him
finally
the
door
opened
and
the
three
girls
trooped
out
huh
is
the
conspiracy
all
growled
the
major
uncle
john
woke
up
with
a
final
snort
removed
the
newspaper
from
his
face
and
sat
up
he
smiled
benignantly
upon
his
nieces
it
all
your
fault
sor
declared
major
doyle
selecting
the
little
millionaire
as
the
safest
recipient
of
his
displeasure
your
foolishness
has
involved
us
all
in
this
dreadful
complication
why
on
earth
could
you
leave
alone
uncle
john
received
the
broadside
with
tolerant
equanimity
what
wrong
my
dears
he
enquired
directing
his
mild
glance
toward
the
bevy
of
young
girls
i
am
unaware
that
anything
is
wrong
uncle
replied
louise
gravely
but
since
we
are
about
to
make
our
debut
in
society
it
is
natural
we
should
have
many
things
to
discuss
that
would
prove
quite
uninteresting
to
men
really
uncle
john
this
is
a
great
event
perhaps
the
most
important
event
of
our
lives
shucks
an
shoestrings
grunted
the
major
what
in
this
painted
hollow
thing
ye
call
to
interest
three
healthy
girls
tell
me
that
you
do
understand
dear
said
patsy
soothing
him
with
a
kiss
i
think
he
does
remarked
beth
with
meditative
brows
modern
society
is
a
or
condition
to
a
large
extent
artificial
selfish
and
unwholesome
oh
beth
protested
louise
you
talking
like
a
rank
socialist
i
can
understand
common
people
sneering
at
society
which
is
so
far
out
of
their
reach
but
a
girl
about
to
be
accepted
in
the
best
circles
has
no
right
to
rail
at
her
own
caste
there
can
be
no
caste
in
america
declared
beth
stubbornly
but
there
caste
in
america
and
will
be
so
long
as
the
exclusiveness
of
society
is
recognized
by
the
people
at
large
continued
louise
if
it
is
a
condition
is
it
the
most
respected
most
refined
most
desirable
condition
that
one
may
attain
to
there
are
plenty
of
honest
and
happy
people
in
the
world
who
ignore
society
altogether
answered
beth
it
strikes
me
that
your
social
stars
are
mighty
few
in
the
broad
firmament
of
humanity
but
they
stars
for
all
that
dear
said
uncle
john
smiling
at
her
with
a
hint
of
approval
in
his
glance
yet
picking
up
the
argument
and
they
look
mighty
big
and
bright
to
the
crowd
below
it
quite
natural
you
ca
keep
individuals
from
gaining
distinction
even
in
america
there
are
few
generals
in
an
army
for
instance
and
they
but
that
no
reason
the
generals
ai
entitled
to
our
admiration
let
admire
then
from
a
distance
retorted
the
major
realizing
the
military
simile
was
employed
to
win
his
sympathy
certain
things
my
dear
major
are
naturally
dear
to
a
girl
heart
continued
uncle
john
musingly
and
we
who
are
not
girls
have
no
right
to
condemn
their
natural
longings
girls
love
dancing
pink
teas
and
and
where
can
they
find
in
all
their
perfection
but
in
high
society
girls
love
admiration
and
flirtations
you
do
my
dears
you
ca
deny
it
and
the
male
society
swells
have
the
most
time
to
devote
to
such
things
girls
love
pretty
dresses
oh
uncle
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
now
exclaimed
patsy
laughing
we
must
all
have
new
gowns
for
this
reception
and
as
to
assist
miss
von
taer
the
dresses
must
harmonize
so
to
speak
and
and
and
be
quite
suited
to
the
occasion
broke
in
louise
and
and
wear
our
lives
out
with
innumerable
fittings
concluded
beth
gloomily
but
why
new
dresses
demanded
the
major
you
plenty
of
old
ones
that
are
clean
and
pretty
i
sure
and
our
patsy
had
one
from
the
dressmaker
only
last
week
that
fit
for
a
queen
oh
daddy
you
do
understand
laughed
patsy
this
time
major
i
fear
you
do
agreed
beth
your
convictions
regarding
society
may
be
admirable
but
you
weak
on
the
gown
question
if
the
women
would
only
listen
to
me
began
the
major
dictatorially
but
uncle
john
cut
him
short
they
wo
sir
they
listen
to
no
man
when
it
comes
to
dressmaking
do
they
dress
to
captivate
the
men
then
asked
the
major
with
fine
sarcasm
not
at
all
answered
louise
loftily
men
seldom
know
what
a
woman
has
on
if
she
looks
nice
but
women
take
in
every
detail
of
dress
and
criticise
it
severely
if
anything
happens
to
be
out
of
date
ill
fitting
or
in
bad
taste
then
they
in
bad
taste
themselves
retorted
the
major
hotly
sir
who
are
you
to
criticise
woman
ways
asked
uncle
john
much
amused
the
major
was
silenced
but
he
glared
as
if
unconvinced
dressmaking
is
a
nuisance
remarked
beth
placidly
but
it
the
penalty
we
pay
for
being
women
you
nothing
but
slips
o
girls
not
out
of
your
teens
grumbled
the
major
and
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
we
want
to
do
you
credit
uncle
john
said
patsy
brightly
perhaps
our
names
will
be
in
the
papers
they
there
already
announced
merrick
picking
up
the
sunday
paper
that
lay
beside
him
a
chorus
of
exclamations
was
followed
by
a
dive
for
the
paper
and
even
the
major
smiled
grimly
as
he
observed
the
three
girlish
heads
close
together
and
three
pair
of
eager
eyes
scanning
swiftly
the
society
columns
here
it
is
cried
patsy
dancing
up
and
down
like
a
and
louise
read
in
a
dignified
voice
which
trembled
slightly
with
excitement
and
pleasure
the
following
item
miss
von
taer
will
receive
next
thursday
evening
at
the
family
mansion
in
honor
of
miss
merrick
miss
doyle
and
miss
de
graf
these
three
charming
are
nieces
of
john
merrick
the
famous
magnate
phoo
growled
the
major
during
the
impressive
hush
that
followed
that
it
exactly
your
names
are
printed
because
you
john
merrick
nieces
if
it
had
been
for
my
dears

the
fly
in
the
broth
diana
was
an
experienced
entertainer
and
under
her
skillful
supervision
the
reception
proved
eminently
successful
nor
had
she
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
the
three
she
presented
to
society
since
capable
had
supplemented
their
girlish
charms
and
freshness
with
costumes
pertinent
to
the
occasion
perhaps
patsy
chubby
form
looked
a
little
dumpish
in
her
party
gown
for
some
of
diana
female
guests
regarded
her
with
quiet
amusement
and
bored
tolerance
while
the
same
critical
posse
was
amazed
and
envious
at
beth
superb
beauty
and
stately
bearing
after
all
it
was
louise
who
captured
the
woman
contingency
and
scored
the
greatest
success
for
her
appearance
was
not
only
dainty
and
attractive
but
she
was
so
perfectly
and
responsive
and
bore
herself
so
admirably
under
the
somewhat
trying
circumstances
of
a
debut
that
she
won
the
cordial
goodwill
of
all
whom
she
encountered
the
hostess
was
elaborately
gowned
in
white
pompadour
satin
trimmed
with
white
chiffon
and
embroidered
in
pink
roses
and
pearls
the
von
taer
home
was
handsomely
decorated
for
the
occasion
since
diana
never
did
anything
by
halves
and
for
her
own
credit
insisted
on
attention
to
those
details
of
display
that
society
recognizes
and
loves
hundreds
of
american
beauties
and
kentia
palms
were
combined
in
beautifying
the
spacious
hall
while
orchids
in
marvelous
variety
nodded
their
blossoms
in
the
great
where
the
received
these
rare
and
precious
flowers
were
arranged
in
bronze
baskets
with
sprays
of
maidenhair
in
the
music
room
adjoining
great
clusters
of
madam
chantenay
roses
embellished
the
charming
scene
branches
of
supplied
by
were
banked
in
the
lofty
where
a
japanese
pergola
made
of
bamboo
and
lighted
with
red
lanterns
was
erected
at
the
upper
end
the
attendants
here
were
japanese
girls
in
native
costume
and
the
long
table
was
laid
with
a
lace
cloth
over
pink
satin
with
butterfly
bows
of
pink
tulle
the
table
itself
was
decorated
with
baskets
of
cecil
brunner
roses
mingled
with
lilies
of
the
valley
and
refreshments
were
distributed
to
the
standing
guests
as
they
entered
the
affair
was
in
the
nature
of
a
typical
crush
for
diana
list
of
eligibles
included
most
of
the
prominent
society
folk
then
in
town
and
she
was
too
important
a
personage
to
have
her
invitations
disregarded
beth
and
patsy
were
fairly
bewildered
by
the
numerous
introductions
until
names
became
meaningless
in
their
ears
but
louise
perfectly
composed
and
in
no
wise
distracted
by
her
surroundings
or
the
music
of
the
orchestra
and
the
perpetual
buzz
of
conversation
in
the
crowded
rooms
impressed
each
individual
upon
her
memory
clearly
and
was
not
likely
to
blunder
in
regard
to
names
or
individuality
in
the
future
this
is
a
rare
talent
indeed
and
scores
largely
in
one
favor
for
no
one
likes
to
think
himself
so
unimportant
as
to
be
forgotten
under
any
circumstances
it
was
during
the
thick
of
the
reception
that
one
of
miss
von
intimates
a
graceful
blond
girl
suddenly
seized
her
arm
and
whispered
oh
diana
guess
who
here
guess
my
dear
diana
knew
her
eyes
always
narrowed
until
the
lashes
shielded
their
sharp
watchfulness
seldom
missed
observing
anything
of
importance
she
pressed
her
hand
and
turned
again
to
the
line
of
guests
while
louise
who
had
overheard
the
excited
whisper
wondered
casually
what
it
might
mean
soon
after
she
knew
a
tall
handsome
young
fellow
was
bowing
before
diana
who
wonder
of
wonders
for
an
instant
unclosed
her
great
eyes
and
shot
an
electric
glance
into
his
smiling
face
the
glance
was
brief
as
unexpected
yet
it
must
have
told
the
young
man
something
for
he
flushed
and
bowed
again
as
if
to
hide
his
embarrassment
it
also
told
louise
something
and
her
heart
which
had
given
a
quick
bound
at
sight
of
the
man
face
began
to
cry
out
against
diana
von
taer
artifices
arthur
weldon
said
the
hostess
in
her
soft
voice
and
now
as
the
young
man
turned
an
eager
gaze
on
louise
and
half
extended
his
hand
the
girl
face
grew
pale
and
she
imitated
diana
to
the
extent
of
dropping
her
eyes
and
bowing
with
frigid
indifference
standing
close
he
whispered
louise
in
a
pleading
tone
that
made
diana
frown
wickedly
but
the
girl
was
unresponsive
and
another
instant
forced
him
to
turn
to
beth
why
arthur
are
you
here
then
said
the
girl
in
a
surprised
but
cordial
tone
that
is
not
astonishing
miss
beth
he
replied
the
puzzling
fact
is
that
are
here
and
under
such
auspices
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
patsy
now
claimed
him
with
a
frank
greeting
and
arthur
weldon
could
do
little
more
than
press
her
hand
when
the
line
forced
him
to
move
on
and
give
place
to
others
but
this
especial
young
fellow
occupied
the
minds
of
all
four
girls
long
after
the
crowd
had
swallowed
him
up
diana
was
uneasy
and
obviously
disturbed
by
the
discovery
that
he
was
known
to
the
three
cousins
as
well
as
by
the
memory
of
his
tone
as
he
addressed
louise
merrick
louise
who
had
read
diana
quick
glance
with
the
accuracy
of
an
intuitionist
felt
a
sudden
suspicion
and
dislike
for
diana
now
dominating
her
behind
all
this
was
a
mystery
which
shall
be
explained
here
because
the
reader
deserves
to
be
more
enlightened
than
the
characters
themselves
arthur
weldon
nature
was
a
queer
combination
of
weakness
and
strength
he
was
physically
brave
but
a
moral
coward
the
motherless
son
of
a
man
wholly
immersed
in
business
he
had
been
much
neglected
in
his
youth
and
his
unstable
character
was
largely
the
result
of
this
neglect
on
leaving
college
he
refused
a
business
career
planned
for
him
by
his
father
who
cast
him
off
with
scornful
indifference
and
save
for
a
slim
temporary
allowance
promised
to
disinherit
him
it
was
during
this
period
that
arthur
met
louise
and
fell
desperately
in
love
with
her
the
girl
appeared
to
return
the
young
fellow
devotion
but
shrewd
worldly
merrick
discovering
that
the
boy
was
practically
disinherited
and
had
no
prospects
whatever
forbade
him
the
house
louise
until
now
but
mildly
interested
in
the
resented
her
mother
interference
and
refused
to
give
him
up
she
found
ways
to
meet
arthur
weldon
outside
her
home
so
that
the
situation
had
become
complicated
and
dangerous
when
uncle
john
seized
his
three
nieces
and
whisked
them
off
to
europe
young
weldon
under
an
assumed
name
followed
and
attached
himself
to
the
party
but
john
merrick
suspicions
were
presently
aroused
and
on
discovering
the
identity
of
the
youth
he
forbade
him
or
louise
to
make
love
or
even
speak
of
such
a
thing
during
the
remainder
of
the
trip
the
young
fellow
by
manly
acts
on
some
occasions
and
grave
weaknesses
on
others
won
uncle
john
kindly
interest
the
old
gentleman
knew
human
nature
and
saw
much
to
admire
as
well
as
condemn
in
friend
beth
and
patsy
found
him
a
pleasant
comrade
and
after
all
was
tabooed
they
were
quite
a
harmonious
party
finally
the
sudden
death
of
weldon
father
left
him
the
possessor
of
a
fortune
he
returned
to
america
to
look
after
his
business
and
became
so
immersed
in
it
that
louise
felt
herself
neglected
when
she
came
home
expecting
him
to
dance
attendance
upon
her
as
before
she
treated
him
coldly
and
he
ceased
calling
his
volatile
and
sensitive
nature
resenting
such
treatment
it
is
curious
what
little
things
influence
the
trend
of
human
lives
many
estrangements
are
caused
by
trifles
so
intangible
that
we
can
scarcely
locate
them
at
all
at
first
the
girl
was
very
unhappy
at
the
alienation
but
soon
schooled
herself
to
forget
her
former
admirer
arthur
weldon
for
his
part
consoled
himself
by
plunging
into
social
distractions
and
devoting
himself
to
diana
von
taer
whose
strange
personality
for
a
time
fascinated
him
the
business
could
not
hold
young
weldon
vacillant
temperament
for
long
neither
could
diana
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
heart
more
staunch
than
he
himself
suspected
had
never
wavered
much
from
louise
yet
pride
forbade
his
attempting
to
renew
their
former
relations
it
was
now
some
months
since
he
had
seen
the
girl
and
his
eager
exclamation
was
wrested
from
him
by
surprise
and
a
sudden
awakening
to
the
fact
that
his
love
for
her
had
merely
slumbered
diana
worldly
cold
and
calculating
as
was
her
nature
had
been
profoundly
touched
by
arthur
devotion
to
her
usually
young
men
were
soon
repulsed
by
her
unfortunate
personality
which
was
not
easily
understood
therefore
her
intense
nature
responded
freely
to
this
admirer
attentions
and
if
diana
could
really
love
she
loved
arthur
weldon
he
had
never
proposed
to
her
or
even
intimated
it
was
his
intention
to
do
so
but
she
conceived
a
powerful
desire
to
win
him
and
had
never
abandoned
this
motive
when
he
grew
cold
and
appeared
to
desert
her
just
now
he
was
recently
back
from
italy
where
he
had
passed
several
months
and
diana
reception
was
his
first
reappearance
in
society
the
girl
had
planned
to
bring
him
to
her
side
this
evening
and
intended
to
exert
her
strongest
fascinations
to
lure
him
back
to
his
former
allegiance
so
her
annoyance
may
be
guessed
when
she
found
her
three
seemingly
more
familiar
with
the
young
man
than
was
she
herself
at
last
the
line
ended
and
the
introductions
were
complete
the
were
at
once
the
center
of
interested
groups
composed
of
those
who
felt
it
a
duty
or
pleasure
to
show
them
attention
diana
wandered
to
the
music
room
and
waylaid
arthur
weldon
who
was
just
about
to
make
his
escape
from
the
house
having
decided
it
was
impossible
to
find
an
opportunity
to
converse
with
louise
that
evening
i
so
glad
you
came
arthur
she
said
a
quick
glance
assuring
her
they
were
not
overheard
you
landed
from
the
steamer
but
yesterday
i
hear
and
came
straightway
to
pay
my
respects
to
my
old
friend
he
answered
lightly
is
it
unusual
for
you
to
present
diana
you
know
these
girls
do
you
arthur
yes
i
met
them
in
europe
and
flirted
with
miss
merrick
be
honest
arthur
i
know
your
secret
do
you
then
you
know
we
were
merely
good
friends
said
he
annoyed
at
her
accusation
of
course
you
called
her
did
you
to
be
sure
and
patsy
called
me
you
may
have
heard
her
patsy
that
miss
patricia
doyle
our
dear
little
patsy
oh
i
sure
you
did
fall
in
love
with
at
any
rate
i
not
so
sure
everybody
loves
patsy
but
i
had
no
time
for
i
was
doing
europe
was
that
a
year
or
so
ago
she
asked
realizing
he
was
trying
to
evade
further
reference
to
louise
yes
and
since
then
i
been
away
the
last
six
or
seven
months
as
you
know
on
my
second
trip
abroad
but
before
that
when
you
first
returned
if
i
remember
rightly
i
was
then
much
in
the
society
of
miss
von
taer
is
the
catechism
ended
at
last
yes
she
replied
laughing
do
think
me
inquisitive
arthur
i
was
surprised
to
find
you
knew
these
girls
with
whom
i
am
myself
but
lightly
acquainted
yet
you
introduce
them
to
your
very
select
set
to
please
my
father
who
wishes
to
please
mr
merrick
i
understand
said
he
nodding
but
they
nice
girls
diana
you
not
running
chances
i
assure
you
that
relieves
me
she
replied
rather
scornfully
if
arthur
weldon
will
vouch
for
them
but
i
do
i
vouch
for
no
one
not
even
myself
he
declared
hastily
she
was
calmly
reading
his
face
and
did
not
seem
to
approve
the
text
are
you
as
fickle
as
ever
then
she
asked
softly
i
not
fickle
diana
my
fault
is
that
i
never
serious
never
i
can
not
remember
ever
being
serious
at
least
where
a
girl
was
concerned
diana
bit
her
lips
to
restrain
a
frown
but
her
eyes
which
he
was
avoiding
flashed
wickedly
that
is
surely
a
fault
my
arthur
was
her
tender
reply
were
you
never
serious
during
our
quiet
evenings
together
our
dances
theatre
parties
and
romps
that
was
merely
fun
and
you
diana
oh
i
enjoyed
the
fun
too
it
meant
so
much
to
me
i
began
to
live
then
and
found
life
very
sweet
but
when
you
suddenly
left
me
and
went
abroad
ah
was
indeed
serious
her
tone
was
full
of
passionate
yearning
he
laughed
trying
to
appear
at
ease
some
sort
of
an
understanding
must
be
had
with
diana
sooner
or
later
and
she
might
as
well
realize
at
this
present
interview
that
the
old
relations
could
not
be
restored
his
nature
was
not
brutal
and
he
disliked
to
hurt
her
moreover
the
boy
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
had
been
a
far
more
ardent
admirer
of
this
peculiar
girl
than
any
fellow
should
be
who
had
had
no
serious
intentions
yet
it
would
be
folly
to
allow
diana
to
think
she
could
win
him
back
to
his
former
allegiance
no
compromising
word
had
ever
left
his
lips
he
had
never
spoken
of
love
to
her
yet
the
girl
attitude
seemed
to
infer
a
certain
possession
of
him
which
was
far
from
agreeable
having
gone
so
far
he
should
have
said
more
but
here
again
his
lack
of
moral
courage
proved
his
and
he
weakly
evaded
a
frank
expression
of
his
true
feelings
life
he
began
somewhat
haltingly
to
break
the
embarrassing
pause
is
only
serious
when
we
make
it
so
and
as
soon
as
we
make
it
serious
it
makes
us
unhappy
so
i
adopted
one
invariable
rule
to
laugh
and
be
gay
then
i
too
will
be
gay
and
together
we
enjoy
life
responded
diana
with
an
effort
to
speak
lightly
i
shall
let
your
moods
be
my
moods
arthur
as
a
good
friend
should
are
we
not
affinities
again
he
knew
not
what
to
say
her
persistence
in
clinging
to
her
intangible
hold
upon
him
was
extremely
irritating
and
he
realized
the
girl
was
far
too
clever
for
him
to
cope
with
and
was
liable
to
cause
him
future
trouble
instead
of
seizing
the
opportunity
to
frankly
undeceive
her
he
foolishly
evaded
the
subject
you
been
tempting
fate
he
remarked
with
assumed
carelessness
do
you
remember
that
to
stand
four
girls
in
a
row
is
a
bad
omen
only
for
the
one
who
first
winks
is
that
the
way
the
saying
goes
i
seldom
wink
myself
she
continued
smilingly
but
i
have
no
faith
in
ill
omens
their
power
is
entirely
due
to
mental
fear
i
think
not
said
arthur
glad
the
conversation
had
taken
this
turn
once
i
knew
a
fellow
with
thirteen
letters
in
his
name
he
had
no
mental
fear
but
he
proposed
to
a
girl
and
was
accepted
she
gave
him
one
of
those
sudden
swift
glances
that
were
so
disconcerting
if
you
had
a
middle
initial
there
would
be
thirteen
letters
in
your
own
name
arthur
weldon
but
i
have
diana
i
have
he
protested
eagerly
and
if
ever
i
propose
to
a
girl
i
sure
she
refuse
me
but
i
no
intention
of
doing
such
a
crazy
thing
so
i
perfectly
safe
you
can
not
be
sure
until
you
try
arthur
she
replied
pointedly
and
with
a
start
he
became
conscious
that
he
was
again
treading
upon
dangerous
ground
come
let
us
rejoin
your
guests
said
he
offering
her
his
arm
they
would
all
hate
me
if
they
knew
i
was
keeping
the
fair
diana
from
them
so
long
arthur
i
must
have
a
good
long
talk
with
you
one
of
our
old
delightful
confabs
she
said
earnestly
will
you
call
sunday
afternoon
then
we
shall
be
quite
undisturbed
he
hesitated
sunday
afternoon
he
answered
yes
all
right
i
come
diana
she
gave
him
a
grateful
look
and
taking
his
arm
allowed
him
to
lead
her
back
to
the
the
crush
was
over
many
having
already
departed
some
of
the
young
people
were
dancing
in
the
open
spaces
to
the
music
of
a
string
orchestra
hidden
behind
a
bank
of
ferns
in
the
hall
louise
and
beth
were
the
centers
of
attentive
circles
patsy
conversed
with
merry
freedom
with
a
group
of
ancient
dowagers
who
delighted
in
her
freshness
and
healthy
vigor
and
were
flattered
by
her
consideration
merrick
for
she
had
been
invited
sat
in
a
corner
gorgeously
robed
and
stiff
as
a
poker
her
eyes
devouring
the
scene
noting
the
triumph
of
louise
she
failed
to
realize
she
was
herself
neglected
a
single
glance
sufficed
to
acquaint
diana
with
all
this
and
after
a
gracious
word
to
her
guests
here
and
there
she
asked
arthur
to
dance
with
her
he
could
not
well
refuse
but
felt
irritated
and
annoyed
when
he
observed
louise
eyes
fastened
upon
him
in
amused
disdain
after
a
few
turns
he
discovered
some
departing
ones
waiting
to
bid
their
hostess
and
escaped
from
his
unpleasant
predicament
by
halting
his
partner
before
them
then
he
slipped
away
and
quietly
left
the
house
before
diana
had
time
to
miss
him
chapter
vii
the
hero
enters
and
trouble
begins
the
von
taer
reception
fully
launched
the
three
nieces
in
society
endorsed
by
diana
and
backed
by
john
merrick
millions
and
their
own
winsome
charms
they
were
sure
to
become
favorites
in
that
admirable
set
to
which
they
had
fortunately
gained
admittance
cards
poured
in
upon
them
during
the
succeeding
days
and
they
found
themselves
busy
returning
calls
and
attending
dinners
fetes
bridge
parties
and
similar
diversions
the
great
sandringham
took
a
decided
fancy
to
louise
and
when
the
committee
was
appointed
to
arrange
for
the
social
kermess
to
be
held
in
december
this
dictatorial
leader
had
the
girl
name
included
in
the
list
naturally
the
favor
led
to
all
three
cousins
taking
active
part
in
the
most
famous
social
event
of
the
season
and
as
an
especial
mark
of
favoritism
they
were
appointed
to
conduct
the
flower
booth
one
of
the
important
features
of
the
kermess
merrick
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
ecstatic
delight
uncle
john
declared
his
three
girls
were
sure
to
become
shining
lights
if
not
actual
constellations
wherever
they
might
be
placed
major
doyle
growled
and
protested
but
was
secretly
pleased
to
have
our
patsy
the
captain
of
the
dress
parade
where
he
fondly
imagined
she
outclassed
all
others
all
former
denunciations
of
society
at
large
were
now
ignored
even
by
unimpressive
beth
and
the
girls
soon
became
deeply
interested
in
their
novel
experiences
arthur
weldon
sulked
at
home
unhappy
and
undecided
for
a
day
or
two
after
the
reception
sunday
noon
he
dispatched
a
messenger
to
diana
with
a
note
saying
he
would
be
unable
to
keep
his
appointment
with
her
that
afternoon
then
he
went
straight
to
the
merrick
home
and
sent
his
card
to
louise
the
girl
flushed
smiled
frowned
and
decided
to
go
down
no
one
had
ever
interested
her
so
much
as
arthur
weldon
there
had
been
a
spice
of
romance
about
their
former
relations
that
made
her
still
regard
him
as
exceptional
among
mankind
she
had
been
asking
herself
since
the
night
of
the
reception
if
she
still
loved
him
but
could
not
come
to
a
positive
conclusion
the
boy
was
no
longer
ineligible
as
he
had
been
at
first
even
uncle
john
could
now
have
no
serious
objection
to
him
he
was
handsome
agreeable
occupied
a
good
social
position
and
was
fairly
well
off
in
the
way
of
worldly
goods
the
last
point
removing
merrick
former
rejection
of
arthur
as
a
desirable
but
girls
are
wayward
and
peculiar
in
such
an
du
and
none
of
these
things
might
have
weighed
with
louise
had
she
not
discovered
that
diana
von
taer
was
in
love
with
arthur
and
intended
to
win
him
that
aroused
the
girl
fighting
instincts
rendered
the
young
man
doubly
important
and
easily
caused
louise
to
forget
her
resentment
at
his
temporary
desertion
of
her
perhaps
she
reflected
it
had
partially
been
her
own
fault
now
that
arthur
showed
a
disposition
to
renew
their
friendship
and
she
might
promise
herself
the
satisfaction
of
defeating
diana
ambitions
it
would
be
diplomatic
at
least
to
receive
the
youth
with
cordial
frankness
therefore
she
greeted
him
smilingly
and
with
outstretched
hand
saying
this
is
quite
a
surprise
weldon
i
a
notion
you
had
forgotten
me
no
indeed
louise
how
could
you
imagine
such
a
thing
he
answered
reproachfully
there
was
some
evidence
of
the
fact
she
asserted
archly
at
one
time
you
gave
me
no
peace
then
you
became
retiring
at
last
you
disappeared
wholly
what
could
i
think
sir
under
such
circumstances
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
thoughtfully
how
pretty
she
had
grown
and
how
mature
and
womanly
louise
said
he
gently
do
let
us
indulge
in
mutual
reproaches
some
one
must
have
been
at
fault
and
i
willingly
take
all
the
blame
if
you
will
forgive
me
once
we
were
were
good
friends
we
we
intended
to
be
still
more
to
one
another
louise
but
something
occurred
i
know
what
to
to
separate
us
why
you
went
away
said
the
girl
laughing
and
that
of
course
separated
us
you
treated
me
like
a
beggar
do
forget
that
part
of
it
dear
of
course
i
went
away
and
consoled
yourself
with
a
certain
miss
diana
von
taer
it
has
lately
been
rumored
you
are
engaged
to
her
me
what
nonsense
but
he
hushed
guiltily
and
louise
noted
everything
and
determined
he
should
not
escape
punishment
diana
at
least
is
in
earnest
she
remarked
with
assumed
indifference
you
may
not
care
to
deny
that
you
have
been
very
attentive
to
her
not
especially
so
he
declared
stoutly
people
gossip
you
know
and
diana
is
charming
she
an
iceberg
oh
you
have
discovered
that
was
she
wholly
unresponsive
then
no
he
said
with
a
touch
of
anger
i
have
never
cared
for
diana
except
in
a
friendly
way
she
amused
me
for
a
while
when
when
i
was
wretched
but
i
never
made
love
to
her
not
for
a
moment
afterward
why
then
well
what
then
as
he
hesitated
growing
red
again
i
found
she
had
taken
my
careless
attentions
in
earnest
and
the
play
was
getting
dangerous
so
i
went
abroad
louise
considered
this
explanation
seriously
she
believed
he
was
speaking
the
truth
so
far
as
he
knew
but
at
the
same
time
she
realized
from
her
own
experience
that
arthur
might
as
easily
deceive
himself
as
diana
in
his
estimate
as
to
the
warmth
of
the
devotion
he
displayed
his
nature
was
impetuous
and
ardent
that
diana
should
have
taken
his
attentions
seriously
and
become
infatuated
with
the
handsome
young
fellow
was
not
a
matter
to
cause
surprise
gradually
louise
felt
her
resentment
disappearing
in
arthur
presence
the
charm
of
his
personality
influenced
her
to
be
lenient
with
his
shortcomings
and
his
evident
desire
for
a
reconciliation
found
an
echo
in
her
own
heart
mutual
explanations
are
excellent
to
clear
a
murky
atmosphere
and
an
hour
earnest
conversation
did
much
to
restore
these
two
congenial
spirits
to
their
former
affectionate
relations
of
course
louise
did
not
succumb
too
fully
to
his
pleadings
for
her
feminine
instinct
warned
her
to
keep
the
boy
on
the
anxious
seat
long
enough
to
enable
him
to
appreciate
her
value
and
the
honor
of
winning
her
good
graces
moreover
she
made
some
severe
conditions
and
put
him
on
his
good
behavior
if
he
proved
worthy
and
was
steadfast
and
true
why
then
the
future
might
reward
him
freely
diana
had
been
making
careful
plans
for
her
interview
with
arthur
that
sunday
afternoon
with
no
futile
attempt
to
deceive
herself
as
to
existent
conditions
she
coldly
weighed
the
chances
in
her
mental
scale
and
concluded
she
had
sufficient
power
to
win
this
unstable
youth
to
her
side
and
induce
him
to
forget
that
such
a
person
as
louise
merrick
ever
existed
diana
was
little
experienced
in
such
affairs
it
is
true
arthur
weldon
had
been
her
first
and
only
declared
admirer
and
no
one
living
had
studied
his
peculiar
nature
more
critically
than
this
observant
girl
also
she
knew
well
her
own
physical
failings
she
realized
that
her
personality
was
to
many
repulsive
rather
than
attractive
and
this
in
spite
of
her
exquisite
form
her
perfect
breeding
and
many
undeniable
accomplishments
men
as
a
rule
seldom
remained
at
her
side
save
through
politeness
and
even
seemed
to
fear
her
but
never
until
now
had
she
cared
for
any
man
sufficiently
to
wish
to
retain
or
interest
him
there
were
unsuspected
fascinations
lying
dormant
in
her
nature
and
miss
von
taer
calmly
reflected
that
the
exercise
of
these
qualities
backed
by
her
native
wit
and
capacity
for
intrigue
could
easily
accomplish
the
object
she
desired
thus
she
had
planned
her
campaign
and
carefully
dressed
herself
in
anticipation
of
arthur
call
when
his
note
came
canceling
the
engagement
after
rereading
his
lame
excuse
she
sat
down
in
a
quiet
corner
and
began
to
think
the
first
gun
had
been
fired
the
battle
was
on
and
like
a
wise
general
she
carefully
marshaled
her
forces
for
combat
an
hour
or
two
later
she
turned
to
her
telephone
book
and
called
up
the
merrick
establishment
a
voice
that
of
a
maid
evidently
answered
her
i
wish
to
speak
with
miss
merrick
said
diana
louise
annoyed
at
being
disturbed
left
arthur
side
to
respond
to
the
call
who
is
it
please
she
asked
is
weldon
still
there
or
has
he
gone
enquired
diana
disguising
her
voice
and
speaking
why
he
still
here
answered
bewildered
louise
but
who
is
talking
please
no
answer
do
you
wish
to
speak
with
mr
weldon
continued
the
girl
mystified
at
such
an
odd
procedure
diana
hung
up
her
receiver
severing
the
connection
the
click
of
the
instrument
assured
louise
there
was
no
use
in
waiting
longer
so
she
returned
to
arthur
she
could
not
even
guess
who
had
called
her
arthur
could
though
when
he
had
heard
her
story
and
diana
impudent
meddling
made
him
distinctly
uneasy
he
took
care
not
to
enlighten
louise
and
the
incident
was
soon
forgotten
by
her
it
proved
just
as
i
expected
mused
diana
huddled
in
her
chair
the
fool
has
thrown
me
over
to
go
to
her
but
this
is
not
important
with
the
situation
so
clearly
defined
i
shall
know
exactly
what
i
must
do
to
protect
my
own
interests
mr
von
taer
was
away
from
home
that
sunday
afternoon
and
would
not
return
until
a
late
hour
diana
went
to
the
telephone
again
and
after
several
unsuccessful
attempts
located
her
cousin
charles
connoldy
mershone
at
a
club
it
diana
she
said
when
at
last
communication
was
established
i
want
you
to
come
over
and
see
me
at
once
you
have
to
excuse
me
di
was
the
answer
i
was
unceremoniously
kicked
out
the
last
time
you
know
father
away
it
all
right
charlie
come
along
ca
see
it
my
fair
cousin
you
all
treated
me
like
a
and
i
not
anxious
to
mix
up
with
that
sort
of
a
relationship
anything
more
i
going
to
play
pool
to
win
my
dinner
funds
running
low
charlie
worse
than
that
they
invisible
then
pay
attention
call
a
taxi
at
once
and
get
here
as
soon
as
you
can
i
foot
the
bill
and
any
others
that
happen
to
be
bothering
you
a
low
surprised
whistle
came
over
the
wire
what
up
di
he
asked
with
new
interest
come
and
find
out
can
i
be
useful
assuredly
to
yourself
all
right
i
on
the
way
he
hung
up
and
diana
gave
a
sigh
of
content
as
she
slowly
returned
to
her
den
and
the
easy
chair
where
mershone
found
her
coiled
some
half
hour
later
this
is
a
queer
go
said
the
young
man
taking
a
seat
and
glancing
around
with
knitted
brows
it
is
so
long
since
dear
uncle
hedrik
tumbled
me
out
of
here
neck
and
crop
and
now
cousin
diana
invites
me
to
return
at
first
glance
young
mershone
seemed
an
attractive
young
fellow
tall
finely
formed
and
well
groomed
but
his
eyes
were
too
close
together
and
his
handsome
features
bore
unmistakable
marks
of
dissipation
you
disgraced
us
a
year
or
so
ago
charlie
said
diana
in
her
soft
quiet
accents
and
under
such
circumstances
we
could
not
tolerate
you
you
can
scarcely
blame
us
for
cutting
your
acquaintance
but
now
well
now
he
enquired
coolly
trying
to
read
her
impassive
face
i
need
the
services
of
just
such
an
unscrupulous
and
clever
individual
as
you
have
proven
yourself
to
be
i
willing
to
pay
liberally
for
those
services
and
you
doubtless
need
the
money
are
we
allies
then
mershone
laughed
with
little
genuine
mirth
of
course
my
dear
cousin
he
responded
provided
you
propose
any
legal
villainy
i
not
partial
to
the
police
but
i
really
need
the
money
as
you
suggest
and
you
will
be
faithful
she
asked
regarding
him
doubtfully
to
the
cause
you
may
be
sure
but
understand
me
i
balk
at
murder
and
burglary
somehow
the
police
seem
to
know
me
i
not
do
anything
that
might
lead
to
a
jail
sentence
because
there
are
easier
ways
to
get
money
however
i
do
imagine
your
proposed
plan
is
very
desperate
diana
it
more
liable
to
be
dirty
work
never
mind
you
may
command
me
my
dear
cousin
if
the
pay
is
ample
the
pay
will
be
ample
if
you
succeed
she
began
i
do
like
that
i
may
not
succeed
listen
to
me
charlie
do
you
know
arthur
weldon
slightly
not
very
well
i
intend
to
marry
him
he
has
paid
me
marked
attentions
in
the
past
but
now
he
wants
to
slip
the
leash
quite
natural
my
dear
he
has
become
infatuated
with
another
girl
a
inexperienced
little
thing
who
is
likely
to
marry
the
first
man
who
asks
her
she
is
very
rich
in
her
own
right
too
and
her
husband
will
be
a
fortunate
man
mershone
stared
at
her
then
he
whistled
took
a
few
turns
up
and
down
the
room
and
reseated
himself
evidently
he
ejaculated
lighting
a
cigarette
without
permission
and
then
leaning
back
thoughtfully
in
his
chair
charlie
continued
diana
you
may
as
well
marry
louise
merrick
and
settle
down
to
a
life
of
respectability
you
a
dashing
masterful
way
which
no
girl
of
her
sort
can
long
resist
i
propose
that
you
make
desperate
love
to
louise
merrick
and
so
cut
arthur
weldon
out
of
the
deal
entirely
my
part
of
the
comedy
will
be
to
attract
him
to
my
side
again
now
you
have
the
entire
proposition
in
a
nutshell
he
smoked
for
a
time
in
reflective
silence
what
the
girl
like
he
enquired
presently
is
she
attractive
sufficiently
so
to
fascinate
arthur
weldon
moreover
she
has
just
been
introduced
in
our
set
and
knows
nothing
of
your
shady
past
history
even
if
rumors
came
to
her
ears
young
creatures
of
her
sort
often
find
a
subtle
charm
in
a
man
accused
of
being
humph
if
you
win
her
you
get
a
wife
easily
managed
and
a
splendid
fortune
to
squander
as
you
please
sounds
interesting
di
does
it
but
in
regard
to
preliminary
expenses
she
interrupted
calmly
i
have
said
that
your
reward
will
be
ample
when
you
have
won
the
game
but
meantime
i
am
willing
to
invest
the
necessary
funds
in
the
enterprise
i
will
allow
you
a
thousand
a
month
bah
that
nothing
at
all
said
he
contemptuously
as
he
flicked
the
ashes
from
his
cigarette
what
do
you
demand
then
five
hundred
a
week
in
advance
it
an
expensive
job
di
very
well
i
will
give
you
five
hundred
a
week
but
only
as
long
as
you
work
earnestly
to
carry
out
the
plot
i
shall
watch
you
charlie
and
you
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
ultimate
reward
i
wo
my
sweet
cousin
it
a
bargain
he
said
readily
enough
when
do
i
begin
and
what
the
program
draw
your
chair
nearer
said
diana
restraining
her
triumphant
joy
i
explain
everything
to
you
in
detail
it
will
be
my
part
to
plan
and
yours
to
execute
good
he
exclaimed
with
a
cheerful
grin
i
feel
like
an
executioner
already
chapter
viii
opening
the
campaign
louise
little
romance
which
now
began
to
thrive
vigorously
was
regarded
with
calmness
by
her
cousins
and
her
mother
who
knew
of
the
former
episode
between
her
and
arthur
and
attached
little
importance
to
the
renewed
flirtation
in
which
they
indulged
that
they
were
deceived
in
their
estimate
was
due
to
the
girl
reputation
for
frivolity
where
young
men
were
concerned
she
had
been
dubbed
a
flirt
ever
since
she
first
began
to
wear
long
dresses
and
her
nature
was
not
considered
deep
enough
for
her
heart
to
be
ever
seriously
affected
therefore
the
young
girl
was
gravely
misjudged
louise
was
not
one
to
bare
her
heart
even
to
her
most
intimate
friends
and
no
one
now
suspected
that
at
last
her
deepest
truest
womanly
affections
were
seriously
involved
the
love
for
arthur
that
had
lain
dormant
in
her
heart
was
aroused
at
a
time
when
she
was
more
mature
and
capable
of
recognizing
truly
her
feelings
so
that
it
was
not
long
before
she
surrendered
her
reserve
and
admitted
to
him
that
life
would
mean
little
for
her
unless
they
might
pass
the
years
together
for
his
part
young
weldon
sincerely
loved
louise
and
had
never
wavered
from
his
firm
devotion
during
all
the
past
months
of
misunderstanding
the
general
impression
that
they
were
merely
flirting
afforded
the
lovers
ample
opportunity
to
have
their
walks
and
drives
together
undisturbed
and
during
these
soulful
communions
they
arrived
at
such
a
perfect
understanding
that
both
were
confident
nothing
could
ever
disturb
their
trust
and
confidence
it
was
at
a
theatre
party
that
the
three
first
met
charlie
mershone
but
they
saw
little
of
him
that
first
evening
and
scarcely
noticed
his
presence
louise
indeed
noted
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
more
than
once
with
thinly
veiled
admiration
and
without
a
thought
of
disloyalty
to
arthur
but
acting
upon
the
impulse
of
her
coquettish
nature
she
responded
with
a
demure
smile
of
encouragement
charlie
mershone
was
an
adept
at
playing
parts
he
at
first
regarded
louise
much
as
a
hunter
does
the
game
he
is
stalking
patsy
doyle
was
more
jolly
and
beth
de
graf
more
beautiful
than
miss
merrick
but
the
young
man
would
in
any
event
have
preferred
the
latter
dainty
personality
when
he
found
her
responsive
to
his
admiring
glances
he
was
astounded
to
note
his
heart
beating
rapidly
a
thing
quite
foreign
to
his
usual
temperament
yes
this
girl
would
do
very
nicely
both
as
a
wife
and
as
a
banker
assuredly
the
game
was
well
worth
playing
as
diana
had
asserted
he
must
make
it
his
business
to
discover
what
difficulties
must
be
overcome
in
winning
her
of
course
arthur
weldon
was
the
main
but
weldon
was
a
ninny
he
must
be
thrust
aside
diana
had
promised
to
attend
to
that
never
in
his
life
had
charles
connoldy
mershone
been
in
earnest
before
after
his
first
interview
with
louise
merrick
he
became
in
deadly
earnest
his
second
meeting
with
her
was
at
marie
delmar
bridge
whist
party
where
they
had
opportunity
for
an
extended
conversation
arthur
was
present
this
evening
but
by
some
chance
mershone
drew
louise
for
his
partner
at
cards
and
being
a
skillful
player
he
carried
her
in
progression
from
table
to
table
leaving
poor
arthur
far
behind
and
indulging
in
merry
repartee
and
mild
flirtation
until
they
felt
they
were
quite
well
acquainted
louise
found
the
young
man
a
charming
conversationalist
he
had
a
dashing
confidential
way
of
addressing
the
girl
which
impressed
her
as
flattering
and
agreeable
while
his
spirits
were
so
exuberant
and
sparkling
with
humor
that
she
was
thoroughly
amused
every
moment
while
in
his
society
indeed
mershone
was
really
talented
and
had
he
possessed
any
manly
attributes
or
even
the
ordinary
honorable
instincts
of
mankind
there
is
little
doubt
he
would
have
been
a
popular
favorite
but
he
had
made
his
mark
and
it
was
a
rather
grimy
one
from
earliest
youth
he
had
been
guilty
of
discreditable
acts
that
had
won
for
him
the
contempt
of
all
people
that
he
was
still
accepted
with
lax
tolerance
by
some
of
the
more
thoughtless
matrons
of
the
fashionable
set
was
due
to
his
family
name
they
could
not
forget
that
in
spite
of
his
numerous
lapses
from
respectability
he
was
still
a
mershone
not
one
of
the
careless
mothers
who
admitted
him
to
her
house
would
have
allowed
her
daughter
to
wed
him
and
the
degree
of
tolerance
extended
to
him
was
fully
appreciated
by
mershone
himself
he
knew
he
was
practically
barred
from
the
most
desirable
circles
and
seldom
imposed
himself
upon
his
former
acquaintances
but
now
with
a
distinct
object
in
view
he
callously
disregarded
the
doubtful
looks
he
encountered
and
showed
himself
in
every
where
he
could
secure
an
invitation
or
impudently
intrude
himself
he
made
frank
avowals
that
he
had
reformed
and
abandoned
his
evil
ways
forever
some
there
were
who
accepted
this
statement
seriously
and
diana
furthered
his
cause
by
treating
him
graciously
whenever
they
met
whereas
she
had
formerly
refused
to
recognize
her
cousin
louise
knew
nothing
at
all
of
charlie
mershone
history
and
permitted
him
to
call
when
he
eagerly
requested
the
favor
but
on
the
way
home
from
the
delmars
arthur
who
had
glowered
at
the
usurper
all
the
evening
took
pains
to
hint
to
louise
that
mershone
was
an
undesirable
acquaintance
and
had
a
bad
record
of
course
she
laughed
at
him
and
teased
him
thinking
he
was
jealous
and
rejoicing
that
in
mershone
she
had
a
tool
to
keep
arthur
toeing
the
mark
as
a
matter
of
truth
she
had
really
missed
her
lover
companionship
that
evening
but
forbore
to
apprise
him
of
the
fact
and
now
the
great
kermess
began
to
occupy
the
minds
of
the
three
cousins
who
were
to
share
the
important
flower
booth
between
them
the
kermess
was
to
be
the
holiday
sensation
of
the
season
and
bade
fair
to
eclipse
the
horse
show
in
popularity
it
was
primarily
a
charitable
entertainment
as
the
net
receipts
were
to
be
divided
among
several
deserving
hospitals
nevertheless
it
was
classed
as
a
high
society
function
and
only
the
elect
were
to
take
active
part
in
the
affair
the
ball
room
at
the
waldorf
had
been
secured
and
many
splendid
booths
were
to
be
erected
for
the
sale
of
novelties
notions
and
refreshments
there
were
to
be
lotteries
and
auctions
national
dances
given
by
groups
of
society
belles
and
other
novel
entertainments
calculated
to
empty
the
pockets
of
the
unwary
beth
was
somewhat
indignant
to
find
that
she
and
her
cousins
having
been
assigned
to
the
flower
booth
were
expected
to
erect
a
pavilion
and
decorate
it
at
their
own
expense
as
well
as
to
provide
the
stock
of
flowers
to
be
sold
there
is
no
fund
for
preliminary
expenses
you
know
remarked
sandringham
and
of
course
all
the
receipts
are
to
go
to
charity
so
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
stand
these
little
bills
ourselves
we
all
do
it
willingly
the
papers
make
a
good
deal
of
the
kermess
and
the
advertisement
we
get
is
worth
all
it
costs
us
beth
did
not
see
the
force
of
this
argument
she
thought
it
was
dreadful
for
society
really
good
society
to
wish
to
advertise
itself
but
gradually
she
was
learning
that
this
was
merely
a
part
of
the
game
to
be
talked
about
to
have
her
goings
and
comings
heralded
in
the
society
columns
and
her
gowns
described
on
every
possible
occasion
seemed
the
desire
of
every
society
woman
and
she
who
could
show
the
biggest
of
clippings
was
considered
of
highest
uncle
john
laughed
joyously
when
told
that
the
expenses
of
the
flower
booth
would
fall
on
the
shoulders
of
his
girls
and
there
was
no
later
recompense
why
not
he
cried
must
we
pay
the
fiddler
if
we
dance
it
a
game
declared
beth
angrily
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
yes
you
will
my
dear
replied
her
uncle
and
to
avoid
separating
you
chicks
from
your
i
going
to
stand
every
cent
of
the
expense
myself
why
it
for
charity
is
it
charity
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
and
i
just
a
miserable
sinner
that
needs
a
to
snuggle
in
how
can
the
poor
be
better
served
than
by
robbing
the
rich
go
ahead
girls
and
rig
up
the
swellest
booth
that
money
will
build
i
furnish
as
many
flowers
as
you
can
sell
and
charity
ought
to
get
a
neat
little
out
of
the
deal
that
nice
of
you
said
patsy
kissing
him
but
it
an
imposition
all
the
same
it
a
blessing
my
dear
it
will
help
a
bit
to
ease
off
that
dreadful
income
that
threatens
to
crush
me
he
rejoined
smiling
at
them
and
the
nieces
made
no
further
protest
well
knowing
the
kindly
old
gentleman
would
derive
untold
pleasure
in
carrying
out
his
generous
plans
the
flower
booth
designed
by
a
famous
architect
proved
a
splendid
and
most
imposing
structure
it
was
capped
by
a
monster
bouquet
of
artificial
orchids
in
which
reached
twenty
feet
into
the
air
the
three
cousins
had
their
gowns
especially
designed
for
the
occasion
beth
represented
a
lily
louise
a
rose
and
patricia
a
pansy
the
big
ball
room
had
been
turned
over
to
the
society
people
several
days
in
advance
that
the
elaborate
preparations
might
be
completed
in
time
and
during
this
period
groups
of
busy
energetic
young
folks
gathered
by
day
and
in
the
evenings
decorating
flirting
rehearsing
the
fancy
dances
and
amusing
themselves
generally
arthur
weldon
was
there
to
assist
uncle
john
nieces
but
his
pleasure
was
somewhat
marred
by
the
persistent
presence
of
charlie
mershone
who
having
called
once
or
twice
upon
louise
felt
at
liberty
to
attach
himself
to
her
party
the
ferocious
looks
of
his
rival
were
ignored
by
this
designing
young
man
and
he
had
no
hesitation
in
interrupting
a
to
monopolize
the
girl
for
himself
louise
was
amused
thinking
it
fun
to
worry
arthur
by
flirting
mildly
with
mershone
for
whom
she
cared
not
a
jot
both
patsy
and
beth
took
occasion
to
remonstrate
with
her
for
this
folly
for
having
known
weldon
for
a
long
time
and
journeyed
with
him
through
a
part
of
europe
they
naturally
espoused
his
cause
liking
him
as
much
as
they
intuitively
disliked
mershone
one
evening
arthur
his
patience
exhausted
talked
seriously
with
louise
this
fellow
mershone
said
he
is
a
bad
egg
a
despicable
son
of
a
decadent
family
his
mother
was
hedrik
von
taer
sister
but
the
poor
thing
has
been
dead
many
years
not
long
ago
charlie
was
tabooed
by
even
the
rather
fast
set
he
belonged
to
and
the
von
taers
especially
refused
to
recognize
their
relative
now
he
seems
to
go
everywhere
again
i
do
know
what
has
caused
the
change
i
sure
why
he
has
reformed
declared
louise
diana
told
me
so
she
said
he
had
been
a
bit
wild
as
all
young
men
are
but
now
his
behavior
is
irreproachable
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
insisted
arthur
mershone
is
a
natural
cad
he
been
guilty
of
all
sorts
of
dirty
tricks
and
is
capable
of
many
more
if
you
watch
out
louise
you
see
that
all
the
girls
are
shy
of
being
found
in
his
society
and
all
the
chaperons
cluck
to
their
fledglings
the
moment
the
hawk
appears
you
a
novice
in
society
just
yet
my
dear
and
it
wo
do
you
any
good
to
encourage
charlie
mershone
whom
everyone
else
avoids
he
very
nice
returned
louise
lightly
yes
he
must
be
nicer
than
i
am
admitted
the
young
man
glumly
and
thereupon
he
became
silent
and
morose
and
louise
found
her
evening
spoiled
the
warning
did
not
fall
on
barren
ground
however
in
the
seclusion
of
her
own
room
the
girl
thought
it
all
over
and
decided
she
had
teased
her
true
lover
enough
arthur
had
not
scolded
or
reproached
her
despite
his
annoyance
and
she
had
a
feeling
that
his
judgment
of
charlie
mershone
was
quite
right
although
the
latter
was
evidently
madly
in
love
with
her
the
girl
had
the
discretion
to
see
how
selfish
and
unrestrained
was
his
nature
and
once
or
twice
he
had
already
frightened
her
by
his
impetuosity
she
decided
to
retreat
cautiously
but
positively
from
further
association
with
him
and
at
once
began
to
show
the
young
man
coolness
mershone
must
have
been
chagrined
but
he
did
not
allow
louise
to
see
there
was
any
change
in
their
relations
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
merely
redoubled
his
attentions
sending
her
flowers
and
bonbons
daily
accompanied
by
ardently
worded
but
respectful
notes
really
louise
was
in
a
quandary
and
she
frankly
admitted
to
arthur
that
she
had
brought
this
embarrassment
upon
herself
yet
arthur
could
do
or
say
little
to
comfort
her
he
longed
secretly
to
punch
mershone
head
but
could
find
no
occasion
for
such
decided
action
diana
during
this
time
treated
both
arthur
and
louise
with
marked
cordiality
believing
her
time
would
come
to
take
part
in
the
comedy
she
refrained
from
interfering
prematurely
with
the
progress
of
events
she
managed
to
meet
her
accomplice
at
frequent
intervals
and
was
pleased
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
urge
charlie
to
do
his
utmost
in
separating
the
lovers
i
bound
to
win
di
he
said
grimly
for
i
love
the
girl
even
better
than
i
do
her
fortune
and
of
one
thing
you
may
rest
assured
weldon
shall
never
marry
her
what
will
you
do
asked
diana
curiously
anything
everything
that
is
necessary
to
accomplish
my
purpose
be
careful
said
she
warningly
keep
a
cool
head
charlie
and
do
anything
foolish
still
well
if
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
few
chances
do
it
arthur
weldon
must
not
marry
louise
merrick
chapter
ix
the
von
taer
pearls
uncle
john
really
had
more
fun
out
of
the
famous
kermess
than
anyone
else
the
preparations
gave
him
something
to
do
and
he
enjoyed
doing
openly
as
well
as
in
secret
ways
having
declared
that
he
would
stock
the
flower
booth
at
his
own
expense
he
confided
to
no
one
his
plans
the
girls
may
have
thought
he
would
merely
leave
orders
with
a
florist
but
that
was
not
the
merrick
way
of
doing
things
instead
he
visited
the
most
famous
greenhouses
within
a
radius
of
many
miles
contracting
for
all
the
floral
blooms
that
art
and
skill
could
produce
the
kermess
was
to
be
a
three
days
affair
and
each
day
the
floral
treasures
of
the
cast
were
delivered
in
reckless
profusion
at
the
flower
booth
which
thus
became
the
center
of
attraction
and
the
marvel
of
the
public
the
girls
were
delighted
to
be
able
to
dispense
such
blooms
and
their
success
as
saleswomen
was
assured
at
once
of
course
the
fair
vendors
were
ignorant
of
the
value
of
their
wares
for
uncle
john
refused
to
tell
them
how
extravagant
he
had
been
so
they
were
obliged
to
guess
at
the
sums
to
be
demanded
and
in
consequence
sold
priceless
orchids
and
rare
hothouse
flora
at
such
ridiculous
rates
that
merrick
chuckled
with
amusement
until
he
nearly
choked
the
public
being
cordially
invited
uncle
john
was
present
on
that
first
important
evening
and
wonder
of
wonders
was
arrayed
in
an
immaculate
suit
that
fitted
his
chubby
form
like
the
skin
of
a
banana
mayor
doyle
likewise
disguised
locked
arms
with
his
and
stalked
gravely
among
the
throng
but
neither
ever
got
to
a
point
in
the
big
room
where
the
flower
booth
was
not
in
plain
sight
the
major
pride
in
our
patsy
was
something
superb
uncle
john
was
proud
of
all
three
of
his
nieces
as
the
sale
of
wares
was
for
the
benefit
of
charity
these
old
fellows
purchased
liberally
mostly
flowers
and
had
enough
parcels
sent
home
to
fill
a
delivery
wagon
one
disagreeable
incident
only
marred
this
otherwise
successful
evening
successful
especially
for
the
three
cousins
whose
beauty
and
grace
won
the
hearts
of
all
diana
von
taer
was
stationed
in
the
hindoo
booth
and
the
oriental
costume
she
wore
exactly
fitted
her
sensuous
style
of
beauty
to
enhance
its
effect
she
had
worn
around
her
neck
the
famous
string
of
von
taer
pearls
a
collection
said
to
be
unmatched
in
beauty
and
unequaled
in
value
in
all
new
york
the
hindoo
booth
was
near
enough
to
the
flower
booth
for
diana
to
watch
the
cousins
and
the
triumph
of
her
late
was
very
bitter
for
her
to
endure
especially
annoying
was
it
to
find
arthur
weldon
devoting
himself
assiduously
to
louise
who
looked
charming
in
her
rose
gown
and
favored
arthur
in
a
marked
way
although
charlie
mershone
refusing
to
be
ignored
also
leaned
over
the
counter
of
the
booth
and
chatted
continually
striving
to
draw
miss
merrick
attention
to
himself
forced
to
observe
all
this
diana
soon
lost
her
accustomed
coolness
the
sight
of
the
happy
faces
of
arthur
and
louise
aroused
all
the
rancor
and
subtile
wit
that
she
possessed
and
she
resolved
upon
an
act
that
she
would
not
before
have
believed
herself
capable
of
leaning
down
she
released
the
catch
of
the
famous
pearls
and
unobserved
concealed
them
in
a
handkerchief
then
leaving
her
booth
she
sauntered
slowly
over
to
the
floral
display
which
was
surrounded
for
the
moment
by
a
crowd
of
eager
customers
many
of
the
vases
and
pottery
jars
which
had
contained
flowers
now
stood
empty
and
just
before
the
station
of
louise
merrick
the
stock
was
sadly
depleted
this
was
of
course
offset
by
the
store
of
money
in
the
little
drawer
beside
the
fair
and
louise
having
greeted
diana
with
a
smile
and
nod
turned
to
renew
her
conversation
with
the
young
men
besieging
her
diana
leaned
gracefully
over
the
counter
resting
the
hand
containing
the
handkerchief
over
the
mouth
of
an
empty
doulton
vase
empty
save
for
the
water
which
had
nourished
the
flowers
at
the
same
time
she
caught
louise
eye
and
with
a
gesture
brought
the
girl
to
her
side
those
young
men
are
wealthy
she
said
carelessly
her
head
close
to
that
of
louise
make
them
pay
well
for
their
purchases
my
dear
i
ca
rob
them
diana
was
the
laughing
rejoinder
but
it
is
your
duty
to
rob
at
a
kermess
and
in
the
interests
of
charity
persisted
diana
maintaining
her
voice
at
a
whisper
louise
was
annoyed
thank
you
she
said
and
went
back
to
the
group
awaiting
her
the
floral
booth
was
triangular
beth
officiated
at
one
of
the
three
sides
patsy
at
another
and
louise
at
the
third
diana
now
passed
softly
around
the
booth
interchanging
a
word
with
the
other
two
girls
after
which
she
returned
to
her
own
station
presently
while
chatting
with
a
group
of
acquaintances
she
suddenly
clasped
her
throat
and
assuming
an
expression
of
horror
exclaimed
my
pearls
what
the
von
taer
pearls
cried
one
the
von
taer
pearls
said
diana
as
if
dazed
by
her
misfortune
and
you
lost
them
dear
they
lost
she
echoed
well
there
was
excitement
then
you
may
be
sure
one
man
hurried
to
notify
the
and
the
private
detective
employed
oh
all
such
occasions
while
others
hastily
searched
the
booth
of
course
in
vain
diana
seemed
distracted
and
the
news
spread
quickly
through
the
assemblage
have
you
left
this
booth
at
all
asked
a
quiet
voice
that
of
the
official
whose
business
it
was
to
investigate
i
i
merely
walked
over
to
the
floral
booth
opposite
and
exchanged
a
word
with
miss
merrick
and
the
others
there
she
explained
the
search
was
resumed
and
charlie
mershone
sauntered
over
what
this
di
lost
the
big
pearls
i
hear
he
said
she
took
him
aside
and
whispered
something
to
him
he
nodded
and
returned
at
once
to
the
flower
booth
around
which
a
crowd
of
searchers
now
gathered
much
to
the
annoyance
of
louise
and
her
cousins
it
all
foolishness
you
know
said
uncle
john
to
the
major
confidentially
if
the
girl
really
dropped
her
pearls
some
one
has
picked
them
up
long
ago
young
mershone
seemed
searching
the
floral
booth
as
earnestly
as
the
others
and
awkwardly
knocked
the
doulton
vase
from
the
shelf
with
his
elbow
it
smashed
to
fragments
and
in
the
pool
of
water
on
the
floor
appeared
the
missing
pearls
there
was
an
awkward
silence
for
a
moment
while
all
eyes
turned
curiously
upon
louise
who
served
this
side
of
the
triangle
the
girl
appeared
turned
to
stone
as
she
gazed
down
at
the
gems
mershone
laughed
disagreeably
and
picked
up
the
recovered
treasure
which
diana
ran
forward
and
seized
said
the
detective
with
a
shrug
this
is
a
strange
occurrence
a
very
strange
occurrence
indeed
miss
von
taer
do
you
wish
no
exclaimed
diana
haughtily
i
accuse
no
one
it
is
enough
that
an
accident
has
restored
to
me
the
heirloom
stiffly
she
marched
back
to
her
own
booth
and
the
crowd
quietly
dispersed
leaving
only
arthur
uncle
john
and
the
major
standing
to
support
louise
and
her
astonished
cousins
why
confound
it
cried
the
little
millionaire
with
a
red
face
does
the
jade
mean
to
insinuate
not
at
all
sor
interrupted
the
major
sternly
her
early
education
has
been
neglected
that
all
come
dear
pleaded
arthur
to
louise
let
us
go
home
by
no
means
announced
beth
positively
let
us
stay
where
we
belong
why
we
not
half
sold
out
yet
chapter
x
misled
arthur
weldon
met
mershone
at
a
club
next
afternoon
you
low
scoundrel
he
exclaimed
it
was
trick
to
accuse
miss
merrick
of
a
theft
last
night
was
she
accused
enquired
the
other
blandly
i
had
heard
really
you
did
it
yourself
dear
me
said
mershone
deliberately
lighting
a
cigarette
you
or
your
precious
cousin
you
both
alike
declared
arthur
bitterly
but
you
have
given
us
wisdom
mershone
we
see
you
trick
us
again
the
young
man
stared
at
him
between
puffs
of
smoke
it
occurs
to
me
weldon
that
you
becoming
insolent
it
wo
do
my
boy
unless
you
guard
your
tongue
bah
resent
it
if
you
dare
you
coward
coward
yes
a
man
who
attacks
an
innocent
girl
is
a
coward
and
you
been
a
coward
all
your
life
mershone
for
one
reason
or
another
no
one
believes
in
your
pretended
reform
but
i
want
to
warn
you
to
keep
away
from
miss
merrick
hereafter
or
i
take
a
hand
in
your
punishment
myself
for
a
moment
the
two
eyed
one
another
savagely
they
were
equally
matched
in
physique
but
arthur
was
right
there
was
no
fight
in
mershone
that
is
of
the
order
he
would
fight
in
his
own
way
doubtless
and
this
made
him
more
dangerous
than
his
antagonist
supposed
what
right
have
you
sir
to
speak
for
miss
merrick
he
demanded
the
best
right
in
the
world
replied
arthur
she
is
my
promised
wife
indeed
since
when
that
is
none
of
your
affair
mershone
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
that
little
excitement
you
created
last
night
resulted
in
a
perfect
understanding
between
us
created
you
of
course
miss
merrick
does
not
care
to
meet
you
again
you
will
do
well
to
avoid
her
in
the
future
i
do
believe
you
weldon
you
bluffing
am
i
then
dare
to
annoy
miss
merrick
again
and
i
soon
convince
you
of
my
sincerity
with
this
parting
shot
he
walked
away
leaving
mershone
really
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
he
was
in
earnest
or
not
to
solve
the
question
he
called
a
taxicab
and
in
a
few
minutes
gave
his
card
to
the
merrick
butler
with
a
request
to
see
miss
louise
the
man
returned
with
a
message
that
miss
merrick
was
engaged
please
tell
her
it
is
important
insisted
mershone
again
the
butler
departed
and
soon
returned
any
message
for
miss
merrick
must
be
conveyed
in
writing
sir
he
said
she
declines
to
see
you
mershone
went
away
white
with
anger
we
may
credit
him
with
loving
louise
as
intensely
as
a
man
of
his
caliber
can
love
anyone
his
sudden
dismissal
astounded
him
and
made
him
frantic
with
disappointment
louise
treatment
of
the
past
few
days
might
have
warned
him
but
he
had
no
intuition
of
the
immediate
catastrophe
that
had
overtaken
him
it
was
his
that
was
injured
that
had
become
so
battered
there
was
little
of
it
left
but
he
had
set
his
whole
heart
on
winning
this
girl
and
felt
that
he
could
not
give
her
up
anger
toward
weldon
was
prominent
amongst
his
emotion
he
declared
between
his
set
teeth
that
if
louise
was
lost
to
him
she
should
never
marry
weldon
not
on
diana
account
but
for
his
own
vengeful
satisfaction
was
this
resolve
made
he
rode
straight
to
his
cousin
and
told
her
the
news
the
statement
that
arthur
was
engaged
to
marry
louise
merrick
drove
her
to
a
wild
anger
no
less
powerful
because
she
restrained
any
appearance
of
it
surveying
her
cousin
steadily
through
her
veiled
lashes
she
asked
is
there
no
way
we
can
prevent
this
thing
mershone
stalked
up
and
down
before
her
like
a
caged
beast
his
eyes
were
red
and
wicked
his
lips
were
pressed
tightly
together
diana
said
he
i
never
wanted
anything
in
this
world
as
i
want
that
girl
i
ca
let
that
mollycoddle
marry
her
she
flushed
and
then
frowned
it
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
the
man
of
her
choice
spoken
of
with
such
contempt
but
after
all
their
disappointment
and
desires
were
alike
mutual
and
she
could
not
break
with
charlie
at
this
juncture
suddenly
he
paused
and
asked
do
you
still
own
that
country
home
near
east
orange
yes
but
we
never
occupy
it
now
father
does
not
care
for
the
place
is
it
deserted
practically
so
madame
cerise
is
there
in
charge
old
cerise
i
was
going
to
ask
you
what
had
become
of
that
clever
female
she
was
too
clever
charlie
she
knew
too
much
of
our
affairs
and
was
always
prying
into
things
that
did
not
concern
her
so
father
took
an
antipathy
to
the
poor
creature
and
because
she
has
served
our
family
for
so
long
sent
her
to
care
for
the
house
at
east
orange
pensioned
her
eh
well
this
is
good
news
di
perhaps
the
best
news
in
the
world
i
believe
it
will
help
clear
up
the
situation
old
cerise
and
i
always
understood
each
other
will
you
explain
asked
diana
coldly
i
think
not
my
fair
cousin
i
prefer
to
keep
my
own
counsel
you
made
a
bad
mess
of
that
little
deal
last
night
and
are
responsible
for
the
climax
that
faces
us
besides
a
woman
is
never
a
good
conspirator
i
know
what
you
want
and
i
know
what
i
want
so
i
work
this
plan
alone
if
you
please
and
i
win
di
i
win
as
sure
as
fate
if
you
help
me
you
ask
me
to
help
you
and
remain
in
the
dark
yes
it
better
so
write
me
a
note
to
cerise
and
tell
her
to
place
the
house
and
herself
unreservedly
at
my
disposal
she
stared
at
him
fixedly
and
he
returned
the
look
with
an
evil
smile
so
they
sat
in
silence
a
moment
then
slowly
she
arose
and
moved
to
her
escritoire
drawing
a
sheet
of
paper
toward
her
and
beginning
to
write
is
there
a
telephone
at
the
place
enquired
mershone
abruptly
yes
then
telephone
cerise
after
i
gone
that
will
make
it
doubly
sure
and
give
me
the
number
too
so
i
can
jot
it
down
i
may
need
it
diana
quietly
tore
up
the
note
the
telephone
is
better
she
said
being
in
the
dark
sir
i
prefer
not
to
commit
myself
in
writing
you
quite
right
di
he
exclaimed
admiringly
but
for
sake
do
forget
to
telephone
madame
cerise
i
wo
charlie
and
see
here
keep
your
precious
plans
to
yourself
now
and
always
i
intend
to
know
nothing
of
what
you
do
i
merely
the
eh
well
never
mind
is
old
cerise
to
be
depended
upon
do
you
think
why
not
replied
the
girl
cerise
belongs
to
the
von
taers
body
and
soul
chapter
xi
the
brown
limousine
the
second
evening
of
the
society
kermess
passed
without
unusual
event
and
proved
very
successful
in
attracting
throngs
of
fashionable
people
to
participate
in
its
pleasures
louise
and
her
cousins
were
at
their
stations
early
and
the
second
installment
of
uncle
john
flowers
was
even
more
splendid
and
profuse
than
the
first
it
was
not
at
all
difficult
to
make
sales
and
the
little
money
drawer
began
to
bulge
with
its
generous
receipts
many
a
gracious
smile
or
nod
or
word
was
bestowed
upon
miss
merrick
by
the
society
folk
for
these
people
had
had
time
to
consider
the
accusation
against
her
implied
by
diana
von
taer
manner
when
the
pearls
were
discovered
in
the
empty
flower
vase
being
rather
impartial
judges
for
diana
was
not
a
popular
favorite
with
her
set
they
decided
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
a
niece
of
wealthy
old
john
merrick
would
descend
to
stealing
any
one
jewelry
miss
merrick
might
have
anything
her
heart
desired
pausing
to
count
the
cost
and
moreover
she
was
credited
with
sufficient
common
sense
to
realize
that
the
von
taer
heirlooms
might
easily
be
recognized
anywhere
so
a
little
gossip
concerning
the
queer
incident
had
turned
the
tide
of
opinion
in
favor
and
as
she
was
a
recent
with
a
charming
personality
all
vied
to
assure
her
she
was
held
blameless
a
vast
coterie
of
the
select
hovered
about
the
flower
booth
all
the
evening
and
the
cousins
joyously
realized
they
had
scored
one
of
the
distinct
successes
of
the
kermess
arthur
could
not
get
very
close
to
louise
this
evening
but
he
enjoyed
her
popularity
and
from
his
modest
retirement
was
able
to
exchange
glances
with
her
at
intervals
and
these
glances
assured
him
he
was
seldom
absent
from
her
thoughts
aside
from
this
he
had
the
pleasure
of
glowering
ferociously
upon
charlie
mershone
who
failing
to
obtain
recognition
from
miss
merrick
devoted
himself
to
his
cousin
diana
or
at
least
lounged
nonchalantly
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
hindoo
booth
mershone
was
very
quiet
there
was
a
speculative
look
upon
his
features
that
denoted
an
undercurrent
of
thought
diana
face
was
as
expressionless
as
ever
she
well
knew
her
action
of
the
previous
evening
had
severed
the
cordial
relations
formerly
existing
between
her
and
merrick
nieces
and
determined
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
a
snub
by
keeping
aloof
from
them
she
greeted
whoever
approached
her
station
in
her
usual
gracious
and
cultured
manner
and
refrained
from
even
glancing
toward
louise
hedrik
von
taer
appeared
for
an
hour
this
evening
he
quietly
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
the
complete
arrangements
of
the
kermess
chatted
a
moment
with
his
daughter
and
then
innocently
marched
over
to
the
flower
booth
and
made
a
liberal
purchase
from
each
of
the
three
girls
evidently
the
old
gentleman
had
no
inkling
of
the
incident
of
the
previous
evening
or
that
diana
was
not
still
on
good
terms
with
the
young
ladies
she
had
personally
introduced
to
society
his
action
amused
many
who
noted
it
and
louise
blushing
but
thoroughly
exchanged
her
greetings
with
diana
father
and
thanked
him
heartily
for
his
purchase
mr
von
taer
stared
stonily
at
charlie
mershone
but
did
not
speak
to
him
going
out
he
met
john
merrick
and
the
two
men
engaged
in
conversation
most
cordially
you
did
the
trick
all
right
von
taer
said
the
little
millionaire
and
i
much
obliged
as
you
may
suppose
you
not
ashamed
of
my
three
nieces
i
take
it
your
nieces
merrick
are
very
charming
young
women
was
the
dignified
reply
they
will
grace
any
station
in
life
to
which
they
may
be
called
when
the
evening
entertainment
came
to
an
end
arthur
weldon
took
louise
home
in
his
new
brown
limousine
leaving
patsy
and
her
father
uncle
john
and
beth
to
comfortably
fill
the
doyle
motor
car
now
that
the
engagement
of
the
young
people
had
been
announced
and
accepted
by
their
friends
it
seemed
very
natural
for
them
to
prefer
their
own
society
what
do
you
think
of
it
uncle
john
anyhow
asked
patsy
as
they
rode
home
it
all
right
dear
he
announced
with
a
sigh
i
hate
to
see
my
girls
take
the
matrimonial
dive
but
i
guess
they
got
to
come
to
it
sooner
or
later
later
for
me
laughed
patsy
as
for
young
weldon
continued
merrick
reflectively
he
has
some
mighty
good
points
as
i
found
out
long
ago
also
he
has
some
points
that
need
filing
down
but
i
guess
he
average
up
with
most
young
men
and
louise
seems
to
like
him
so
let
try
to
encourage
to
be
happy
eh
my
dears
louise
said
beth
slowly
is
no
more
perfect
than
arthur
they
both
have
faults
which
time
may
eradicate
and
as
at
present
they
are
not
disposed
to
be
hypercritical
they
ought
to
get
along
nicely
together
if
was
me
said
the
major
oracularly
i
never
marry
weldon
he
wo
propose
to
you
daddy
dear
returned
patsy
mischievously
he
prefers
louise
i
decided
long
ago
said
uncle
john
that
i
never
be
allowed
to
pick
out
the
husbands
for
my
three
girls
husbands
are
a
matter
of
taste
i
guess
and
a
girl
ought
to
know
what
sort
she
wants
if
she
do
and
makes
a
mistake
that
so
you
can
all
choose
for
yourselves
when
the
time
comes
and
i
stand
by
you
my
dears
through
thick
and
thin
if
the
husband
wo
play
fair
you
can
always
bet
your
uncle
john
will
oh
we
know
that
said
patsy
simply
and
beth
added
of
course
uncle
dear
thursday
evening
the
third
and
last
of
the
series
was
after
all
the
banner
night
of
the
great
kermess
all
the
world
of
society
was
present
and
such
wares
as
remained
unsold
in
the
booths
were
quickly
auctioned
off
by
several
fashionable
gentlemen
with
a
talent
for
such
brigandage
then
the
national
dances
and
songs
having
been
given
and
received
enthusiastically
a
grand
ball
wound
up
the
occasion
in
the
merriest
possible
way
charlie
mershone
was
much
in
evidence
this
evening
as
he
had
been
before
but
he
took
no
active
part
in
the
proceedings
and
refrained
from
dancing
his
pet
amusement
diana
observed
that
he
made
frequent
trips
downstairs
perhaps
to
the
hotel
offices
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
his
movements
except
his
cousin
and
miss
von
taer
watching
him
intently
decided
that
underneath
his
calm
exterior
lurked
a
great
deal
of
suppressed
excitement
at
last
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
uncle
john
and
the
major
took
beth
and
patsy
away
early
as
soon
as
their
booth
was
closed
but
louise
stayed
for
a
final
waltz
or
two
with
arthur
she
soon
found
however
that
the
evening
work
and
excitement
had
tired
her
and
asked
to
be
taken
home
i
go
and
get
the
limousine
around
said
arthur
that
new
chauffeur
is
a
stupid
fellow
by
the
time
you
managed
in
this
jam
to
get
your
wraps
i
shall
be
ready
come
down
in
the
elevator
and
i
meet
you
at
the
street
entrance
as
he
reached
the
street
a
man
an
ordinary
servant
to
judge
from
his
appearance
ran
into
him
full
tilt
and
when
they
recoiled
from
the
impact
the
fellow
with
a
muttered
curse
raised
his
fist
and
struck
young
weldon
a
powerful
blow
reeling
backward
a
natural
anger
seized
arthur
who
was
inclined
to
be
and
he
also
struck
out
with
his
fists
never
pausing
to
consider
that
the
more
dignified
act
would
be
to
call
the
police
the
little
spurt
of
fistcuffs
was
brief
but
it
gave
mershone
who
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
near
by
time
to
whisper
to
a
police
officer
who
promptly
seized
the
disputants
and
held
them
both
in
a
firm
grip
what
all
this
he
demanded
sternly
that
drunken
loafer
assaulted
me
without
cause
gasped
arthur
panting
it
a
lie
retorted
the
man
calmly
he
struck
me
first
well
i
arrest
you
both
said
the
officer
arrest
cried
arthur
indignantly
why
confound
it
man
i
no
talk
was
the
stern
command
come
along
and
keep
quiet
as
if
the
whole
affair
had
been
premeditated
and
prearranged
a
patrol
wagon
at
that
instant
backed
to
the
curb
and
in
spite
of
arthur
loud
protests
he
was
thrust
inside
with
his
assailant
and
at
once
driven
away
at
a
rapid
gait
at
the
same
moment
a
brown
limousine
drew
up
quietly
before
the
entrance
louise
appearing
in
the
doorway
in
her
opera
cloak
stood
hesitating
on
the
steps
peering
into
the
street
for
arthur
a
man
in
livery
approached
her
this
way
please
miss
merrick
he
said
weldon
begs
you
to
be
seated
in
the
limousine
he
will
join
you
in
a
moment
with
this
he
led
the
way
to
the
car
and
held
the
door
open
while
the
girl
having
no
suspicion
entered
and
sank
back
wearily
upon
the
seat
then
the
door
abruptly
slammed
and
the
man
in
livery
leaped
to
the
seat
beside
the
chauffeur
and
with
a
jerk
the
car
darted
away
so
sudden
and
astounding
was
this
that
louise
did
not
even
scream
indeed
for
the
moment
her
wits
were
dazed
and
now
charlie
mershone
stepped
from
his
hiding
place
and
with
a
satirical
smile
entered
the
vestibule
and
looked
at
his
watch
he
found
he
had
time
to
show
himself
again
at
the
kermess
for
a
few
moments
before
driving
to
the
ferry
to
catch
the
train
for
east
orange
some
one
touched
him
on
the
arm
very
pretty
sir
and
quite
cleverly
done
remarked
a
quiet
voice
mershone
started
and
glared
at
the
speaker
a
slender
unassuming
man
in
dark
clothes
what
do
you
mean
fellow
i
been
watching
the
comedy
sir
and
i
saw
you
were
the
star
actor
although
you
took
care
to
keep
hidden
in
the
wings
that
bruiser
who
raised
the
row
took
his
arrest
very
easily
i
suppose
you
arranged
to
pay
his
fine
and
he
is
worried
but
the
gentleman
surely
was
in
hard
luck
pounded
one
minute
and
pinched
the
next
you
arranged
it
very
cleverly
indeed
charlie
was
relieved
that
no
mention
was
made
of
the
abduction
of
louise
had
that
incident
escaped
notice
he
gave
the
man
another
sharp
look
and
turned
away
but
the
gentle
touch
again
restrained
him
not
yet
please
mr
mershone
who
are
you
asked
the
other
scowling
the
house
detective
it
my
business
to
watch
things
so
i
noticed
you
talking
to
the
police
officer
i
also
noticed
the
patrol
wagon
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
for
nearly
an
hour
my
report
on
that
will
amuse
them
at
headquarters
wo
it
and
i
noticed
you
nod
to
the
bruiser
just
as
your
victim
came
out
let
go
of
my
arm
sir
do
you
prefer
handcuffs
i
arrest
you
we
run
over
to
the
station
and
explain
things
do
you
know
who
i
am
perfectly
mershone
i
believe
i
ran
you
in
for
less
than
this
some
two
years
ago
you
gave
the
name
of
ryder
then
better
take
another
if
you
the
house
detective
why
do
you
mix
up
in
this
affair
enquired
mershone
his
anxiety
showing
in
his
tone
your
victim
was
a
guest
of
the
house
not
at
all
he
was
merely
attending
the
kermess
that
makes
him
our
guest
sir
are
you
ready
mershone
glanced
around
and
then
lowered
his
voice
it
all
a
little
joke
my
dear
fellow
said
he
and
you
are
liable
to
spoil
everything
with
your
bungling
here
drawing
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
do
let
us
waste
any
more
time
i
busy
the
man
chuckled
and
waved
aside
the
bribe
you
certainly
are
sir
you
busy
just
now
but
i
think
the
sergeant
over
at
the
station
will
give
you
some
leisure
and
listen
mershone
i
got
it
in
for
that
policeman
you
fixed
he
a
cheeky
individual
and
a
new
man
i
inclined
to
think
this
night
work
will
cost
him
his
position
and
the
patrol
which
i
never
can
get
when
i
want
it
seems
under
your
direct
management
these
things
have
got
to
be
explained
and
i
need
your
help
ready
sir
mershone
looked
grave
but
he
was
not
wholly
checkmated
thank
heaven
the
bungling
detective
had
missed
the
departure
of
louise
altogether
charlie
arrest
at
this
critical
juncture
was
most
unfortunate
but
need
not
prove
disastrous
to
his
plot
he
decided
it
would
be
best
to
go
quietly
with
the
man
weldon
had
become
nearly
frantic
in
his
demands
to
be
released
when
mershone
was
ushered
into
the
station
he
started
at
seeing
his
enemy
and
began
to
fear
a
thousand
terrible
indefinite
things
knowing
how
unscrupulous
mershone
was
but
the
waldorf
detective
who
seemed
friendly
with
the
police
sergeant
made
a
clear
brief
statement
of
the
facts
he
had
observed
mershone
denied
the
accusation
the
bruiser
denied
it
the
policeman
and
the
driver
of
the
patrol
wagon
likewise
stolidly
denied
it
indeed
they
had
quite
another
story
to
tell
but
the
sergeant
acted
on
his
own
judgment
he
locked
up
mershone
refusing
bail
he
suspended
the
policeman
and
the
driver
pending
investigation
then
he
released
arthur
weldon
on
his
own
recognisance
the
young
man
promising
to
call
and
testify
when
required
the
house
detective
and
arthur
started
back
to
the
waldorf
together
did
you
notice
a
young
lady
come
to
the
entrance
soon
after
i
was
driven
away
he
asked
anxiously
a
lady
in
a
opera
cloak
sir
yes
yes
why
she
got
into
a
brown
limousine
and
rode
away
arthur
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
thank
goodness
that
chauffeur
had
a
grain
of
sense
said
he
i
would
have
given
him
credit
for
it
anyway
i
glad
miss
merrick
is
safe
huh
grunted
the
detective
stopping
short
i
begin
to
see
this
thing
in
its
true
light
how
stupid
we
been
in
what
way
enquired
arthur
uneasily
why
did
mershone
get
you
arrested
just
at
that
moment
because
he
hated
me
i
suppose
tell
me
could
he
have
any
object
in
spiriting
away
that
young
lady
in
abducting
her
asked
the
detective
could
he
cried
arthur
terrified
and
trembling
he
had
every
object
known
to
villainy
come
to
the
hotel
let
hurry
man
let
fly
chapter
xii
fogerty
at
the
waldorf
arthur
own
limousine
was
standing
by
the
curb
the
street
was
nearly
deserted
the
last
of
the
kermess
people
had
gone
home
weldon
ran
to
his
chauffeur
did
you
take
miss
merrick
home
he
eagerly
enquired
miss
merrick
why
i
have
seen
her
sir
i
thought
you
all
forgotten
me
the
young
man
heart
sank
despair
seized
him
the
detective
was
carefully
examining
the
car
they
pretty
nearly
mates
weldon
as
far
as
the
brown
color
and
general
appearances
go
he
said
but
i
almost
positive
the
car
that
carried
the
young
lady
away
was
of
another
make
what
make
was
it
the
man
shook
his
head
ca
say
sir
i
was
mighty
stupid
and
that
a
fact
but
my
mind
was
so
full
of
that
assault
and
battery
case
and
the
trickery
of
that
fellow
mershone
that
i
was
looking
for
anything
else
can
you
get
away
asked
arthur
can
you
help
me
on
this
case
no
sir
i
must
remain
on
duty
at
the
hotel
but
perhaps
the
young
lady
is
now
safe
at
home
and
we
been
borrowing
trouble
in
case
been
stolen
however
you
better
see
fogerty
who
fogerty
here
his
card
sir
he
a
private
detective
and
may
be
busy
just
now
for
all
i
know
but
if
you
can
get
fogerty
you
got
the
best
man
in
all
new
york
arthur
sprang
into
the
seat
beside
his
driver
and
hurried
to
the
merrick
residence
in
a
few
minutes
merrick
was
in
violent
hysterics
at
the
disappearance
of
her
daughter
arthur
stopped
long
enough
to
telephone
for
a
doctor
and
then
drove
to
the
doyles
he
routed
up
uncle
john
and
the
major
who
appeared
in
pajamas
and
and
told
them
the
startling
news
a
council
of
war
was
straightway
held
uncle
john
trembled
with
nervousness
arthur
was
mentally
stupefied
the
major
alone
was
calm
in
the
first
place
said
he
what
object
could
the
man
have
in
carrying
off
louise
arthur
hesitated
to
prevent
our
marriage
i
suppose
he
answered
mershone
has
an
idea
he
loves
louise
he
made
wild
love
to
her
until
she
cut
his
acquaintance
but
it
wo
help
him
any
to
separate
her
from
her
friends
or
her
promised
husband
declared
the
major
do
worry
we
sure
to
find
her
sooner
or
later
how
how
shall
we
find
her
cried
uncle
john
will
he
murder
her
or
what
why
as
for
that
john
he
safe
locked
up
in
jail
for
the
present
and
unable
to
murder
anyone
retorted
the
major
it
probable
he
meant
to
follow
louise
and
induce
her
by
fair
means
or
foul
to
marry
him
but
he
harmless
enough
for
the
time
being
it
not
for
long
though
said
arthur
fearfully
they
liable
to
let
him
out
in
the
morning
for
he
has
powerful
friends
scoundrel
though
he
is
and
when
he
is
free
then
he
must
be
shadowed
of
course
returned
the
major
nodding
wisely
if
it
true
the
fellow
loves
louise
then
he
no
intention
of
hurting
her
so
make
your
minds
easy
wherever
the
poor
lass
has
been
taken
to
she
probably
safe
enough
but
think
of
her
terror
her
suffering
cried
uncle
john
wringing
his
chubby
hands
poor
child
it
may
be
his
idea
to
compromise
her
and
break
her
heart
we
stop
all
that
john
never
fear
promised
the
major
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
a
good
detective
fogerty
exclaimed
arthur
searching
for
the
card
who
fogerty
i
do
know
get
the
best
man
possible
commanded
merrick
spare
no
expense
hire
a
regiment
of
detectives
if
necessary
i
of
course
you
will
interrupted
the
major
smiling
but
we
wo
need
a
regiment
i
pretty
sure
the
game
is
in
our
hands
from
the
very
start
fogerty
is
highly
recommended
explained
arthur
and
related
what
the
house
detective
of
the
waldorf
had
said
better
go
at
once
and
hunt
him
up
suggested
uncle
john
what
time
is
it
after
two
but
i
go
at
once
do
and
let
us
hear
from
you
whenever
you
anything
to
tell
us
said
the
major
where
patsy
asked
arthur
sound
asleep
mind
ye
not
a
word
of
this
to
patsy
till
she
to
be
told
remember
that
john
well
i
go
said
the
young
man
and
hurried
away
fogerty
lived
on
eleventh
street
according
to
his
card
arthur
drove
down
town
making
good
time
the
chauffeur
asked
surlily
if
this
was
to
be
an
job
and
arthur
savagely
replied
that
it
might
take
a
week
ca
you
see
jones
that
i
in
great
trouble
he
added
but
you
shall
be
well
paid
for
your
extra
time
all
right
sir
that
no
more
than
just
said
the
man
it
none
of
my
affair
you
know
if
a
young
lady
gets
stolen
arthur
was
wise
enough
to
restrain
his
temper
and
the
temptation
to
kick
jones
out
of
the
limousine
five
minutes
later
they
paused
before
a
block
of
ancient
brick
dwellings
and
found
fogerty
number
a
card
over
the
bell
bore
his
name
and
arthur
lit
a
match
and
read
it
then
he
rang
impatiently
only
silence
arthur
rang
a
second
time
waited
and
rang
again
a
panic
of
fear
took
possession
of
him
at
this
hour
of
night
it
would
be
impossible
to
hunt
up
another
detective
if
fogerty
failed
him
he
determined
to
persist
as
long
as
there
was
hope
again
he
rang
look
above
sir
called
jones
from
his
station
in
the
car
arthur
stepped
back
on
the
stone
landing
and
looked
up
a
round
spark
as
from
a
cigarette
was
visible
at
the
open
window
while
he
gazed
the
spark
glowered
brighter
and
illumined
a
pale
haggard
boy
face
surmounted
by
tousled
locks
of
brick
colored
hair
hi
there
said
arthur
does
fogerty
live
here
he
pays
the
rent
answered
a
boyish
voice
with
a
tinge
of
irony
what
wanted
fogerty
is
wanted
is
he
at
home
he
is
responded
the
boy
i
must
see
him
at
once
on
important
business
wake
him
up
my
lad
will
you
wait
a
minute
said
the
youth
and
left
the
window
presently
he
opened
the
front
door
slipped
gently
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
let
sit
in
your
car
he
said
in
soft
quiet
tones
we
can
talk
more
freely
there
but
i
must
see
fogerty
at
once
protested
arthur
i
fogerty
q
fogerty
quintus
fogerty
the
first
and
last
and
only
individual
of
that
name
arthur
hesitated
he
was
terribly
disappointed
are
you
a
detective
he
enquired
by
profession
but
you
ca
be
very
old
the
boy
laughed
i
no
antiquity
sir
said
he
but
i
shed
the
knickerbockers
long
ago
who
sent
you
to
me
why
do
you
ask
i
tired
i
been
busy
weeks
just
finished
my
case
yesterday
and
need
a
rest
a
good
long
rest
but
if
you
want
a
man
refer
you
to
a
friend
gorman
of
the
waldorf
sent
me
to
you
and
said
you
help
me
oh
that
different
case
urgent
sir
very
the
young
lady
i
engaged
to
marry
was
abducted
less
than
three
hours
ago
fogerty
lighted
another
cigarette
and
the
match
showed
arthur
that
the
young
face
was
deeply
lined
while
two
cold
gray
eyes
stared
blankly
into
his
own
let
sit
in
your
limousine
sir
he
repeated
when
they
had
taken
their
places
behind
the
closed
doors
the
boy
asked
arthur
to
tell
him
all
about
it
and
do
forget
any
details
please
so
weldon
hastily
told
the
events
of
the
evening
and
gave
a
history
of
mershone
and
his
relations
with
miss
merrick
the
story
was
not
half
told
when
fogerty
said
tell
your
man
to
drive
to
the
police
station
on
the
way
arthur
resumed
his
rapid
recital
and
strove
to
post
the
young
detective
as
well
as
he
was
able
fogerty
made
no
remarks
nor
did
he
ask
a
single
question
until
weldon
had
told
him
everything
he
could
think
of
then
he
made
a
few
pointed
enquiries
and
presently
they
had
arrived
at
the
station
the
desk
sergeant
bowed
with
great
respect
to
the
youthful
detective
by
the
dim
light
arthur
was
now
able
to
examine
fogerty
for
the
first
time
he
was
small
slim
and
lean
his
face
attested
to
but
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
in
spite
of
its
deep
lines
and
serious
expression
although
his
hair
was
tangled
and
unkempt
fogerty
clothing
and
linen
were
neat
and
of
good
quality
he
wore
a
scotch
cap
and
a
horseshoe
pin
in
his
cravat
one
might
have
imagined
him
to
be
an
errand
boy
a
clerk
a
chauffeur
a
salesman
or
a
house
man
you
might
have
placed
him
in
almost
any
walk
in
life
perhaps
thought
arthur
he
might
even
be
a
good
detective
yet
his
personality
scarcely
indicated
it
mershone
in
billy
the
detective
asked
the
desk
sergeant
room
want
him
not
now
when
is
he
likely
to
go
when
parker
relieves
me
there
been
a
mob
here
to
get
mershone
off
i
could
prevent
his
using
the
telephone
but
i
a
stubborn
duck
eh
quintus
and
now
the
gentleman
has
gone
to
bed
vowing
vengeance
you
all
right
billy
we
both
know
mershone
gentleman
scoundrel
exactly
swell
society
blackleg
what
name
he
docked
under
smith
will
parker
let
him
off
with
a
fine
yes
or
without
it
parker
comes
on
at
six
good
i
take
a
nap
on
that
bench
got
to
keep
the
fellow
in
sight
billy
go
into
my
room
there
a
cot
there
thanks
old
man
i
will
i
dead
tired
then
fogerty
took
arthur
aside
go
home
and
try
to
sleep
he
advised
do
worry
the
young
lady
safe
enough
till
mershone
goes
to
her
hiding
place
when
he
does
i
be
there
too
and
i
try
to
have
you
with
me
do
you
think
you
can
arrange
it
alone
mr
fogerty
asked
arthur
doubtfully
the
boy
seemed
so
very
young
better
than
if
i
had
a
hundred
to
assist
me
why
this
is
an
easy
job
weldon
it
give
me
a
fine
chance
to
rest
up
and
you
wo
lose
mershone
never
he
mine
this
is
very
important
to
me
sir
continued
arthur
nervously
yes
and
to
others
most
of
all
it
important
to
fogerty
do
worry
sir
the
young
man
was
forced
to
go
away
with
this
assurance
he
returned
home
but
not
to
sleep
he
wondered
vaguely
if
he
had
been
wise
to
lean
upon
so
frail
a
reed
as
fogerty
seemed
to
be
and
above
all
he
wondered
where
poor
louise
was
and
if
terror
and
alarm
were
breaking
her
heart
chapter

diana
revolts
charlie
mershone
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
his
release
when
parker
came
on
duty
at
six
he
called
up
a
cab
and
went
at
once
to
his
rooms
at
the
bruxtelle
and
fogerty
followed
him
while
he
discarded
his
took
a
bath
and
donned
his
walking
suit
mershone
was
in
a
brown
study
hours
ago
louise
had
been
safely
landed
at
the
east
orange
house
and
placed
in
the
care
of
old
madame
cerise
who
would
guard
her
like
an
ogre
there
was
no
immediate
need
of
his
hastening
after
her
and
his
arrest
and
the
discovery
of
half
his
plot
had
seriously
disturbed
him
this
young
man
was
no
novice
in
intrigue
nor
even
in
crime
arguing
from
his
own
he
realized
that
the
friends
of
louise
were
by
this
time
using
every
endeavor
to
locate
her
they
would
not
succeed
in
this
he
was
positive
his
plot
had
been
so
audacious
and
all
clews
so
cleverly
destroyed
or
covered
up
that
the
most
skillful
detective
knowing
he
had
abducted
the
girl
would
be
completely
baffled
in
an
attempt
to
find
her
the
thought
of
detectives
in
this
connection
led
him
to
decide
that
he
was
likely
to
be
shadowed
that
was
the
most
natural
thing
for
his
opponents
to
do
they
could
not
prove
mershone
complicity
in
the
disappearance
of
louise
merrick
but
they
might
easily
suspect
him
after
that
little
affair
of
weldon
arrest
therefore
if
he
went
to
the
girl
now
he
was
likely
to
lead
others
to
her
better
be
cautious
and
wait
until
he
had
thrown
the
sleuths
off
his
track
having
considered
this
matter
thoroughly
mershone
decided
to
remain
quiet
by
eight
he
was
breakfasting
in
the
grill
room
and
fogerty
occupied
a
table
just
behind
him
during
the
meal
it
occurred
to
charlie
to
telephone
to
madame
cerise
for
assurance
that
louise
had
arrived
safely
and
without
a
scene
to
attract
the
attention
of
strangers
having
finished
breakfast
he
walked
into
the
telephone
booth
and
was
about
to
call
his
number
when
a
thought
struck
him
he
glanced
out
of
the
glass
door
in
the
hotel
lobby
were
many
loungers
he
saw
a
dozen
pairs
of
eyes
fixed
upon
him
idly
or
curiously
one
pair
might
belong
to
the
suspected
detective
if
he
used
the
telephone
there
would
be
a
way
of
discovering
the
number
he
had
asked
for
that
would
not
do
not
at
all
he
concluded
not
to
telephone
at
present
and
left
the
booth
his
next
act
was
to
purchase
a
morning
paper
and
seating
himself
carelessly
in
a
chair
he
controlled
the
impulse
to
search
for
a
scare
head
on
the
abduction
of
miss
merrick
if
he
came
across
the
item
very
well
he
would
satisfy
no
critical
eye
that
might
be
scanning
him
by
hunting
for
it
with
a
show
of
eagerness
the
game
was
in
his
hands
he
believed
and
he
intended
to
keep
it
there
fogerty
was
annoyed
by
the
man
evident
caution
it
would
not
be
easy
to
surprise
mershone
in
any
action
but
after
all
reflected
the
boy
resting
comfortably
in
the
cushions
of
a
big
leather
chair
all
this
really
made
the
case
the
more
interesting
he
was
rather
glad
mershone
was
in
no
hurry
to
precipitate
a
climax
a
long
stern
chase
was
never
a
bad
chase
by
and
bye
another
idea
occurred
to
charlie
he
would
call
upon
his
cousin
diana
and
get
her
to
telephone
madame
cerise
for
information
about
louise
it
would
do
no
harm
to
enlighten
diana
as
to
what
he
had
done
she
must
suspect
it
already
and
was
she
not
a
but
he
could
not
wisely
make
this
call
until
the
afternoon
so
meantime
he
took
a
stroll
into
broadway
and
walked
leisurely
up
and
down
that
thoroughfare
pausing
occasionally
to
make
a
trifling
purchase
and
turning
abruptly
again
and
again
in
the
attempt
to
discover
who
might
be
following
him
no
one
liable
to
be
a
detective
of
any
sort
could
he
discern
yet
he
was
too
shrewd
to
be
lulled
into
a
false
belief
that
his
each
and
every
act
was
unobserved
mershone
returned
to
his
hotel
went
to
his
room
and
slept
until
after
one
as
he
had
secured
but
little
rest
the
night
before
in
his
primitive
quarters
at
the
police
station
it
was
nearly
two
when
he
reappeared
in
the
hotel
restaurant
for
luncheon
and
he
took
his
seat
and
ate
with
excellent
appetite
during
this
meal
fogerty
also
took
occasion
to
refresh
himself
eating
modestly
at
a
retired
table
in
a
corner
mershone
sharp
eyes
noted
him
he
remembered
seeing
this
youth
at
breakfast
and
thoughtfully
reflected
that
the
boy
appearance
was
not
such
as
might
be
expected
from
the
guest
of
a
fashionable
and
hotel
silently
he
marked
this
individual
as
the
possible
detective
he
had
two
or
three
others
in
his
mind
by
this
time
the
boy
was
merely
added
to
the
list
of
possibilities
mershone
was
a
capital
actor
after
luncheon
he
sauntered
about
the
hotel
stared
from
the
window
for
a
time
looked
at
his
watch
once
or
twice
with
an
undecided
air
and
finally
stepped
to
the
porter
and
asked
him
to
call
a
cab
he
started
for
central
park
then
changed
his
mind
and
ordered
the
man
to
drive
him
to
the
von
taer
residence
where
on
arrival
diana
at
once
ordered
him
shown
into
her
private
parlor
the
young
man
found
his
cousin
stalking
up
and
down
in
an
extremely
nervous
manner
she
wrung
her
delicate
fingers
with
a
swift
spasmodic
motion
her
eyes
nearly
closed
shot
red
rays
through
their
slits
what
wrong
di
demanded
mershone
considerably
surprised
by
this
intense
display
of
emotion
on
the
part
of
his
usually
and
collected
cousin
wrong
she
echoed
everything
is
wrong
you
ruined
yourself
charlie
and
you
going
to
draw
me
into
this
dreadful
crime
also
in
spite
of
all
i
can
do
bah
do
be
a
fool
he
observed
calmly
taking
a
chair
am
the
fool
she
exclaimed
turning
upon
him
fiercely
did
calmly
perpetrate
a
deed
that
was
sure
to
result
in
disgrace
and
defeat
what
on
earth
has
happened
to
upset
you
he
asked
wonderingly
it
strikes
me
everything
is
progressing
beautifully
does
it
indeed
was
her
sarcastic
rejoinder
then
your
information
is
better
than
mine
they
called
me
up
at
three
this
morning
to
enquire
after
louise
merrick
as
if
should
know
her
whereabouts
why
did
they
come
to
for
such
information
why
she
stamped
her
foot
for
emphasis
i
suppose
said
charlie
mershone
they
called
up
everyone
who
knows
the
girl
it
would
be
natural
in
case
of
her
disappearance
come
here
cried
diana
seizing
his
arm
and
dragging
him
to
a
window
be
careful
try
to
look
out
without
showing
yourself
do
you
see
that
man
on
the
corner
well
he
has
been
patrolling
this
house
since
he
a
detective
charlie
whistled
what
makes
you
think
so
di
why
on
earth
should
they
suspect
you
why
because
my
disreputable
cousin
planned
the
abduction
without
consulting
me
and
oh
come
di
that
a
little
too
because
the
girl
has
been
carried
to
the
von
taer
house
house
in
east
orange
because
my
own
servant
is
at
this
moment
her
jailor
and
how
should
they
know
all
this
interrupted
mershone
impatiently
and
how
do
you
happen
to
know
it
yourself
diana
madame
cerise
called
me
up
at
five
just
after
louise
uncle
had
been
here
for
the
second
time
with
a
crew
of
officers
cerise
is
in
an
ugly
mood
she
said
a
young
girl
had
been
brought
to
her
a
prisoner
and
mershone
orders
were
to
keep
her
safely
until
he
came
she
is
greatly
provoked
at
our
using
her
in
this
way
but
promised
to
follow
instructions
if
i
accepted
all
responsibility
what
did
you
tell
her
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
affair
but
had
put
the
house
and
her
services
at
your
disposal
i
said
i
would
accept
no
responsibility
whatever
for
anything
you
might
do
mershone
looked
grave
and
scowled
the
old
hag
wo
betray
us
will
she
he
asked
uneasily
she
can
not
betray
me
for
i
have
done
nothing
charlie
she
said
suddenly
facing
him
i
wo
be
mixed
in
this
horrid
affair
you
must
carry
out
your
infamous
plan
in
your
own
way
i
know
nothing
sir
of
what
you
have
done
i
know
nothing
of
what
you
intend
to
do
do
you
understand
me
he
smiled
rather
grimly
i
hardly
expected
my
fair
cousin
that
you
would
be
frightened
into
retreat
at
this
stage
of
the
game
when
the
cards
are
all
in
our
hands
do
you
suppose
i
decided
to
carry
away
louise
without
fully
considering
what
i
was
doing
and
the
immediate
consequences
of
my
act
and
wherein
have
i
failed
all
has
gone
beautifully
up
to
this
minute
diana
your
fears
are
absolutely
foolish
and
against
your
personal
interests
all
that
i
am
doing
for
myself
benefits
you
doubly
just
consider
if
you
will
what
has
been
accomplished
for
our
mutual
benefit
the
girl
has
disappeared
under
suspicious
circumstances
before
she
again
rejoins
her
family
and
friends
she
will
either
be
my
wife
or
arthur
weldon
will
prefer
not
to
marry
her
that
leaves
him
open
to
appreciate
the
charms
of
diana
von
taer
does
it
not
already
my
dear
cousin
your
wishes
are
accomplished
my
own
task
i
admit
is
a
harder
one
because
it
is
more
delicate
the
brutality
of
this
argument
caused
even
diana
to
shudder
she
looked
at
the
young
man
half
fearfully
as
she
asked
what
is
your
task
why
first
to
quiet
louise
fears
then
to
turn
her
by
specious
arguments
lies
if
you
will
against
weldon
next
to
induce
her
to
give
me
her
hand
in
honest
wedlock
i
shall
tell
her
of
my
love
which
is
sincere
i
shall
argue
threaten
if
necessary
use
every
reasonable
means
to
gain
her
consent
you
never
succeed
cried
diana
with
conviction
then
i
try
other
tactics
said
he
blandly
if
you
do
you
monster
i
expose
you
warned
the
girl
having
dissolved
partnership
you
wo
be
taken
into
my
confidence
my
fair
cousin
you
have
promised
to
know
nothing
of
my
acts
and
i
see
you
do
then
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
came
to
her
with
a
hard
determined
look
upon
his
face
look
here
di
i
gone
too
far
in
this
game
to
back
out
now
i
going
to
carry
it
through
if
it
costs
me
my
life
and
liberty
and
yours
into
the
bargain
i
love
louise
merrick
i
love
her
so
well
that
without
her
the
world
and
its
mockeries
can
go
to
the
devil
there
nothing
worth
living
for
but
louise
louise
going
to
be
my
wife
diana
by
fair
means
or
foul
i
swear
to
make
her
my
wife
he
had
worked
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
excitement
surpassing
that
of
diana
now
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
collected
himself
with
a
slight
shudder
and
resumed
his
seat
diana
was
astonished
his
fierce
mood
served
to
subdue
her
own
regarding
him
curiously
for
a
time
she
finally
asked
you
speak
as
if
you
were
to
be
allowed
to
have
your
own
way
as
if
all
society
was
not
arrayed
against
you
have
you
counted
the
cost
of
your
action
have
you
considered
the
consequences
of
this
crime
i
have
committed
no
crime
he
said
stubbornly
all
fair
in
love
and
war
the
courts
will
refuse
to
consider
that
argument
i
imagine
she
retorted
moreover
the
friends
of
this
kidnaped
girl
are
powerful
and
active
they
will
show
you
no
mercy
if
you
are
discovered
if
i
fail
answered
mershone
slowly
i
do
not
care
a
continental
what
they
do
to
me
for
my
life
will
be
a
blank
without
louise
but
i
really
see
no
reason
to
despair
despite
your
womanish
croakings
all
seems
to
be
going
nicely
and
just
as
i
had
anticipated
i
am
glad
that
you
are
satisfied
diana
returned
with
scornful
emphasis
but
understand
me
sir
this
is
none
of
my
affair
in
any
way
except
that
i
shall
surely
expose
you
if
a
hair
of
the
girl
head
is
injured
you
must
not
come
here
again
i
shall
refuse
to
see
you
you
ought
not
to
have
come
is
there
anything
suspicious
in
my
calling
upon
my
cousin
as
usual
under
such
circumstances
yes
you
have
not
been
received
at
this
house
of
late
years
and
my
father
still
despises
you
there
is
another
danger
you
have
brought
upon
me
my
father
seemed
suspicious
this
morning
and
asked
me
quite
pointedly
what
i
knew
of
this
strange
affair
but
of
course
you
lied
to
him
all
right
diana
perhaps
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
from
your
alliance
and
i
let
you
out
of
the
deal
from
this
moment
the
battle
mine
after
all
and
i
fight
it
alone
but
i
need
more
money
you
ought
to
be
willing
to
pay
for
so
far
the
developments
are
all
in
your
favor
she
brought
a
handful
of
notes
from
her
desk
this
ends
our
partnership
charlie
she
said
very
well
a
woman
makes
a
poor
conspirator
but
is
invaluable
as
a
banker
there
will
be
no
more
money
this
ends
everything
between
us
i
thought
you
were
game
di
but
you
as
weak
as
the
ordinary
feminine
creation
she
did
not
answer
but
stood
motionless
a
defiant
expression
upon
her
face
he
laughed
a
little
bowed
mockingly
and
went
away
chapter
xiv
a
cool
encounter
on
leaving
the
house
mershone
buttoned
his
overcoat
tightly
up
to
his
chin
for
the
weather
was
cold
and
raw
and
then
shot
a
quick
glance
around
him
diana
suspect
was
still
lounging
on
the
corner
charlie
had
little
doubt
he
was
watching
the
house
and
the
movements
of
its
a
bad
sign
he
reflected
with
a
frown
otherwise
the
street
seemed
deserted
he
had
dismissed
the
cab
on
his
arrival
so
now
he
stepped
out
and
walked
briskly
around
the
corner
swinging
his
cane
jauntily
and
looking
very
unlike
a
fugitive
in
the
next
block
he
passed
a
youth
who
stood
earnestly
examining
the
conventional
display
in
a
druggist
window
mershone
observing
this
individual
gave
a
start
but
did
not
alter
his
pace
it
was
the
same
pale
boy
he
had
noticed
twice
before
at
the
hotel
in
his
alert
calculating
mind
there
was
no
coincidence
in
this
meeting
before
he
had
taken
six
more
steps
mershone
realized
the
exact
situation
at
the
next
crossing
he
stopped
and
waited
patiently
for
a
car
up
the
street
he
still
saw
the
youth
profoundly
interested
in
drugs
a
class
of
merchandise
that
seldom
calls
for
such
close
inspection
the
car
arrived
and
carried
mershone
away
it
also
left
the
youth
at
his
post
before
the
window
yet
on
arriving
at
the
bruxtelle
some
twenty
minutes
later
charlie
found
this
same
queer
personage
occupying
a
hotel
chair
in
the
lobby
and
apparently
reading
a
newspaper
with
serious
attention
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
quietly
walked
over
to
a
vacant
chair
beside
the
one
and
sat
down
the
youth
turned
the
paper
glanced
casually
at
his
neighbor
and
continued
reading
a
detective
i
believe
said
mershone
in
a
low
matter
of
fact
tone
who
me
asked
fogerty
lowering
the
paper
yes
your
age
deceived
me
for
a
time
i
imagined
you
were
a
newsboy
or
a
sporting
kid
from
the
country
but
now
i
observe
you
are
older
than
you
appear
all
sorts
of
people
seem
to
drift
into
the
detective
business
i
suppose
your
present
occupation
is
shadowing
me
fogerty
smiled
the
smile
was
genuine
i
might
even
be
a
lawyer
sir
he
replied
and
in
that
case
i
should
undertake
to
you
and
ask
your
reasons
for
so
queer
a
charge
or
you
might
be
a
transient
guest
at
this
hotel
the
other
returned
in
the
same
bantering
tone
for
i
saw
you
at
breakfast
and
luncheon
pretty
fair
here
is
he
but
you
did
stick
to
that
part
you
know
you
followed
me
where
i
made
a
call
on
a
relative
and
you
studied
the
colored
globes
in
a
druggist
window
when
i
went
away
i
wonder
why
people
employ
inexperienced
boys
in
such
important
matters
in
your
case
my
lad
it
was
easy
enough
to
detect
the
detective
you
even
took
the
foolish
chance
of
heading
me
off
and
returned
to
this
hotel
before
i
did
now
then
is
my
charge
unfounded
why
should
you
be
under
the
surveillance
of
a
detective
asked
fogerty
slowly
really
my
boy
i
can
not
say
there
was
an
unpleasant
little
affair
last
night
at
the
waldorf
in
which
i
was
not
personally
concerned
but
suffered
nevertheless
an
officious
deputy
caused
my
arrest
and
i
spent
an
unpleasant
night
in
jail
there
being
nothing
in
the
way
of
evidence
against
me
i
was
released
this
morning
and
now
i
find
a
detective
shadowing
me
what
can
it
all
mean
i
wonder
these
stupid
blunders
are
very
annoying
to
the
plain
citizen
who
however
innocent
feels
himself
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
i
understand
you
sir
said
fogerty
drily
for
some
moments
mershone
now
remained
silent
then
he
asked
what
are
your
instructions
concerning
me
to
his
surprise
the
boy
made
a
simple
frank
admission
i
to
see
you
do
get
into
more
mischief
sir
and
how
long
is
this
nonsense
to
continue
demanded
mershone
showing
a
touch
of
anger
for
the
first
time
depends
on
yourself
mershone
i
no
judge
myself
i
so
young
and
inexperienced
who
is
your
employer
oh
i
just
sent
out
by
an
agency
is
it
a
big
paying
proposition
asked
charlie
eyeing
the
diffident
youth
beside
him
critically
as
if
to
judge
his
true
caliber
not
very
big
you
see
if
i
been
a
better
detective
you
never
have
spotted
me
so
quickly
i
suppose
money
counts
with
you
though
as
it
does
with
everyone
else
in
the
world
of
course
sir
every
business
is
undertaken
to
make
money
mershone
drew
his
chair
a
little
nearer
i
need
a
clever
detective
myself
he
announced
confidentially
anxious
to
discover
what
enemy
is
persecuting
me
in
this
way
would
it
er
be
impossible
for
me
to
employ
to
er
look
after
my
interests
fogerty
was
very
serious
you
see
sir
he
responded
if
i
quit
this
job
they
may
not
give
me
another
in
order
to
be
a
successful
detective
one
must
keep
in
the
good
graces
of
the
agencies
that
easy
enough
asserted
mershone
you
may
pretend
to
keep
this
job
but
go
home
and
take
life
easy
i
send
you
a
daily
statement
of
what
i
been
doing
and
you
can
fix
up
a
report
to
your
superior
from
that
in
addition
to
this
you
can
put
in
a
few
hours
each
day
trying
to
find
out
who
is
annoying
me
in
this
rascally
manner
and
for
this
service
i
pay
you
five
times
the
agency
price
how
does
that
proposition
strike
you
riordan
me
name
riordan
said
fogerty
with
a
smile
no
mershone
shaking
his
head
gravely
i
ca
see
my
way
to
favor
you
it
an
easy
job
now
and
i
afraid
to
take
chances
with
a
harder
one
something
in
the
tone
nettled
mershone
but
the
pay
he
suggested
oh
the
pay
if
i
a
detective
fifty
years
i
make
an
easy
two
thousand
a
year
that
a
round
hundred
thousand
can
you
pay
me
that
much
to
risk
my
future
career
as
a
detective
mershone
bit
his
lip
this
fellow
was
not
so
simple
after
all
boyish
as
he
seemed
and
worse
than
all
he
had
a
suspicion
the
youngster
was
baiting
him
and
secretly
laughing
at
his
offers
of
bribery
they
will
take
you
off
the
job
now
that
i
have
discovered
your
identity
he
asserted
with
malicious
satisfaction
oh
no
answered
fogerty
they
wo
do
that
this
little
interview
merely
simplifies
matters
you
see
sir
i
an
expert
at
disguises
that
my
one
great
talent
as
many
will
testify
but
you
will
notice
that
in
undertaking
this
job
i
resorted
to
no
disguise
at
all
you
see
me
as
nature
made
me
and
was
a
poor
job
i
thinking
why
were
you
so
careless
it
was
carelessness
it
was
premeditated
there
not
the
slightest
objection
to
your
knowing
me
my
only
business
is
to
keep
you
in
sight
and
i
can
do
that
exactly
as
well
as
riordan
as
i
could
by
disguising
myself
mershone
had
it
on
his
tongue
end
to
ask
what
they
expected
to
discover
by
shadowing
him
but
decided
it
was
as
well
not
to
open
an
avenue
for
the
discussion
of
miss
merrick
disappearance
so
finding
he
could
not
bribe
the
youthful
detective
or
use
him
in
any
way
to
his
advantage
he
closed
the
interview
by
rising
i
going
to
my
room
to
write
some
letters
said
he
with
a
yawn
would
you
like
to
read
them
before
they
are
mailed
again
fogerty
laughed
in
his
cheerful
boyish
way
you
make
a
fine
detective
yourself
mershone
he
declared
and
i
advise
you
to
consider
the
occupation
i
a
notion
it
safer
and
better
pay
than
your
present
line
charlie
scowled
at
the
insinuation
but
walked
away
without
reply
fogerty
eyed
his
retreating
figure
a
moment
gave
a
slight
shrug
and
resumed
his
newspaper
day
followed
day
without
further
event
and
gradually
mershone
came
to
feel
himself
trapped
wherever
he
might
go
he
found
fogerty
on
duty
unobtrusive
silent
and
watchful
it
was
very
evident
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
young
man
to
lead
him
to
the
secret
hiding
place
of
louise
merrick
in
one
way
this
constant
surveillance
was
a
distinct
comfort
to
charlie
mershone
for
it
assured
him
that
the
retreat
of
louise
was
still
undiscovered
but
he
must
find
some
way
to
get
rid
of
his
shadow
in
order
that
he
might
proceed
to
carry
out
his
plans
concerning
the
girl
during
his
enforced
leisure
he
invented
a
dozen
apparently
clever
schemes
only
to
abandon
them
again
as
unpractical
one
afternoon
while
on
a
stroll
he
chanced
to
meet
the
bruiser
who
had
attacked
arthur
weldon
at
the
waldorf
and
been
liberally
paid
by
mershone
for
his
excellent
work
he
stopped
the
man
and
glancing
hastily
around
found
that
fogerty
was
a
block
in
the
rear
listen
he
said
i
want
your
assistance
and
if
you
quick
and
sure
there
is
a
pot
of
money
waiting
for
you
i
need
it
mershone
replied
the
man
grinning
there
a
detective
following
me
he
down
the
street
there
a
mere
boy
just
in
front
of
that
tobacco
store
see
him
sure
i
see
him
it
fogerty
his
name
is
riordan
no
it
fogerty
he
no
boy
sir
but
the
slickest
in
the
city
an
that
goin
some
i
can
tell
you
well
you
must
get
him
whoever
he
is
drag
him
away
and
hold
him
for
three
hours
two
one
give
me
a
chance
to
slip
him
that
all
can
you
do
it
i
pay
you
a
hundred
for
the
job
it
worth
two
hundred
mershone
it
is
safe
to
fool
with
fogerty
i
make
it
two
hundred
then
rest
easy
said
the
man
i
know
the
guy
and
how
to
handle
him
you
just
watch
him
like
he
watching
you
mershone
and
if
anything
happens
you
skip
as
lively
as
a
flea
i
can
use
that
two
hundred
in
my
business
then
the
fellow
passed
on
and
fogerty
was
still
so
far
distant
up
the
street
that
neither
of
them
could
see
the
amused
smile
upon
his
thin
face
chapter
xv
a
bewildering
experience
when
louise
merrick
entered
the
brown
limousine
which
she
naturally
supposed
to
belong
to
arthur
weldon
she
had
not
the
faintest
suspicion
of
any
evil
in
her
mind
indeed
the
girl
was
very
happy
this
especial
evening
although
tired
with
her
duties
at
the
kermess
a
climax
in
her
young
life
had
arrived
and
she
greeted
it
joyously
believing
she
loved
arthur
well
enough
to
become
his
wife
now
that
the
engagement
had
been
announced
to
their
immediate
circle
of
friends
she
felt
as
proud
and
elated
as
any
young
girl
has
a
right
to
be
under
the
circumstances
added
to
this
pleasant
event
was
the
social
triumph
she
and
her
cousins
had
enjoyed
at
the
kermess
where
louise
especially
had
met
with
rare
favor
the
fashionable
world
had
united
in
being
most
kind
and
considerate
to
the
dainty
attractive
young
and
only
diana
had
seemed
to
slight
her
this
was
not
surprising
in
view
of
the
fact
that
diana
evidently
wanted
arthur
for
herself
and
there
was
some
satisfaction
in
winning
a
lover
who
was
elsewhere
in
prime
demand
in
addition
to
all
this
the
little
dance
that
concluded
the
entertainment
had
been
quite
delightful
and
all
things
conspired
to
put
louise
in
a
very
contented
frame
of
mind
still
fluttering
with
the
innocent
excitements
of
the
hour
the
girl
went
to
join
arthur
without
a
fear
of
impending
misfortune
she
did
not
think
of
charlie
mershone
at
all
he
had
been
annoying
and
impertinent
and
she
had
rebuked
him
and
sent
him
away
cutting
him
out
of
her
life
altogether
perhaps
she
ought
to
have
remembered
that
she
had
mildly
flirted
with
diana
cousin
and
given
him
opportunity
for
the
impassioned
speeches
she
resented
but
louise
had
a
girlish
idea
that
there
was
no
harm
in
flirting
considering
it
a
feminine
license
she
saw
young
mershone
at
the
kermess
that
evening
paying
indifferent
attentions
to
other
women
and
ignoring
her
and
was
sincerely
glad
to
have
done
with
him
for
good
and
all
she
obeyed
readily
the
man
who
asked
her
to
be
seated
in
the
limousine
arthur
would
be
with
her
in
a
minute
he
said
when
the
door
closed
and
the
car
started
she
had
an
impulse
to
cry
out
but
next
moment
controlled
it
and
imagined
they
were
to
pick
up
weldon
on
some
corner
on
and
on
they
rolled
and
still
no
evidence
of
the
owner
of
the
limousine
what
could
it
mean
louise
began
to
wonder
had
something
happened
to
arthur
so
that
he
had
been
forced
to
send
her
home
alone
as
the
disquieting
thought
came
she
tried
to
speak
with
the
chauffeur
but
could
not
find
the
tube
the
car
was
whirling
along
rapidly
the
night
seemed
very
dark
only
a
few
lights
twinkled
here
and
there
outside
suddenly
the
speed
slackened
there
was
a
momentary
pause
and
then
the
machine
slowly
rolled
upon
a
wooden
platform
a
bell
clanged
there
was
a
whistle
and
the
sound
of
revolving
louise
decided
they
must
be
upon
a
and
became
alarmed
for
the
first
time
the
man
in
livery
now
opened
the
door
as
if
to
reassure
her
where
are
we
where
is
mr
weldon
enquired
the
girl
almost
hysterically
he
is
on
the
boat
miss
and
will
be
with
you
shortly
now
replied
the
man
very
respectfully
weldon
is
very
sorry
to
have
annoyed
you
miss
merrick
but
says
he
will
soon
explain
everything
so
that
you
will
understand
why
he
left
you
with
this
he
quietly
closed
the
door
again
although
louise
was
eager
to
ask
a
dozen
more
questions
prominent
was
the
query
why
they
should
be
on
a
instead
of
going
directly
home
she
knew
the
hour
must
be
late
but
while
these
questions
were
revolving
in
her
mind
she
still
suspected
no
plot
against
her
liberty
she
must
perforce
wait
for
arthur
to
explain
his
queer
conduct
so
she
sat
quietly
enough
in
her
place
awaiting
his
coming
while
the
ferry
puffed
steadily
across
the
river
to
the
jersey
shore
the
stopping
of
the
boat
aroused
louise
from
her
reflections
arthur
not
here
yet
voices
were
calling
outside
vehicles
were
noisily
leaving
their
positions
on
the
boat
to
clatter
across
the
platforms
but
there
was
no
sign
of
arthur
again
louise
tried
to
find
the
speaking
tube
then
she
made
an
endeavor
to
open
the
door
although
just
then
the
car
started
with
a
jerk
that
flung
her
back
against
the
cushions
the
knowledge
that
she
had
been
grossly
deceived
by
her
conductor
at
last
had
the
effect
of
arousing
the
girl
to
a
sense
of
her
danger
something
must
be
wrong
something
decidedly
wrong
and
fear
crept
into
her
heart
she
pounded
on
the
glass
windows
with
all
her
strength
and
shouted
as
loudly
as
she
could
but
all
to
no
avail
swiftly
the
limousine
whirled
over
the
dusky
road
and
either
her
voice
could
not
be
heard
through
the
glass
cage
in
which
she
was
confined
or
there
was
no
one
near
who
was
willing
to
hear
or
to
rescue
her
she
now
realized
how
wrong
she
had
been
to
sit
idly
during
the
trip
across
the
ferry
where
a
score
of
passengers
would
gladly
have
assisted
her
how
cunning
her
captors
had
been
to
lull
her
fears
during
that
critical
period
now
alas
it
was
too
late
to
cry
out
and
she
had
no
idea
where
she
was
being
taken
or
the
reason
of
her
going
presently
it
occurred
to
her
that
this
was
not
arthur
limousine
at
all
there
was
no
speaking
tube
for
one
thing
she
leaned
forward
and
felt
for
the
leathern
pocket
in
which
she
kept
a
veil
and
her
street
gloves
no
pocket
of
any
sort
was
to
be
found
an
unreasoning
terror
now
possessed
her
she
knew
not
what
to
fear
yet
feared
everything
she
made
another
attempt
to
cry
aloud
for
help
and
then
fell
back
unconscious
on
the
cushions
how
long
she
lay
in
the
faint
she
did
not
know
when
she
recovered
the
limousine
was
still
rattling
forward
at
a
brisk
gait
but
bumping
over
ruts
in
a
manner
that
indicated
a
country
road
through
the
curtains
she
could
see
little
but
the
black
night
although
there
was
a
glow
ahead
cast
by
the
searchlights
of
the
car
louise
was
weak
and
unnerved
she
had
no
energy
to
find
a
way
to
combat
her
fate
if
such
a
way
were
possible
a
dim
thought
of
smashing
a
window
and
hurling
herself
through
it
gave
her
only
a
shudder
of
repulsion
she
lacked
strength
for
such
a
desperate
attempt
on
on
on
would
the
dreary
journey
never
end
how
long
must
she
sit
and
suffer
before
she
could
know
her
fate
or
at
least
find
some
explanation
of
the
dreadful
mystery
of
this
wild
midnight
ride
at
last
when
she
had
settled
down
to
dull
despair
the
car
came
to
a
paved
road
and
began
to
move
more
slowly
it
even
stopped
once
or
twice
as
if
the
driver
was
not
sure
of
his
way
but
they
kept
moving
nevertheless
and
before
long
entered
a
driveway
there
was
another
stop
now
and
a
long
wait
louise
lay
dismally
back
upon
the
cushions
sobbing
hysterically
into
her
dripping
handkerchief
the
door
of
her
prison
at
last
opened
and
a
light
shone
in
upon
her
here
we
are
miss
said
the
man
in
uniform
still
in
quiet
respectful
tones
shall
i
assist
you
to
alight
she
started
up
eagerly
her
courage
returning
with
a
bound
stepping
unassisted
to
the
ground
she
looked
around
her
in
bewilderment
the
car
stood
before
the
entrance
to
a
modest
country
house
there
was
a
light
in
the
hall
and
another
upon
the
broad
porch
around
the
house
a
mass
of
trees
and
shrubbery
loomed
dark
and
forbidding
where
am
i
demanded
louise
drawing
back
haughtily
as
the
man
extended
a
hand
toward
her
at
your
destination
miss
was
the
answer
will
you
please
enter
no
not
until
i
have
an
explanation
of
this
this
singular
proceeding
she
replied
firmly
then
she
glanced
at
the
house
the
hall
door
had
opened
and
a
woman
stood
peering
anxiously
at
the
scene
outside
with
sudden
resolve
louise
sprang
up
the
steps
and
approached
her
any
woman
she
felt
in
this
emergency
was
a
welcome
refuge
who
are
you
she
asked
eagerly
and
why
have
i
been
brought
here
will
come
inside
please
said
the
woman
with
a
foreign
accent
it
is
cold
in
the
night
air
she
turned
to
lead
the
way
inside
while
louise
hesitated
to
follow
the
limousine
started
with
a
roar
from
its
cylinders
and
disappeared
down
the
driveway
the
two
men
going
with
it
the
absence
of
the
lamps
rendered
the
darkness
around
the
solitary
house
rather
uncanny
an
intense
stillness
prevailed
except
for
the
diminishing
rattle
of
the
receding
motor
car
in
the
hall
was
a
light
and
a
woman
louise
went
in
chapter
xvi
madame
cerise
custodian
the
woman
closed
the
hall
door
and
locked
it
then
she
led
the
way
to
a
long
dim
in
which
a
grate
fire
was
smouldering
a
stand
lamp
of
antique
pattern
but
dimly
illuminated
the
place
which
seemed
well
furnished
in
an
old
fashioned
way
will
not
you
remove
your
wraps
mees
mees
i
do
not
know
name
what
is
your
own
name
asked
louise
coming
closer
to
gaze
earnestly
into
the
other
face
i
am
called
madame
cerise
if
it
please
you
her
voice
while
softened
to
an
extent
by
the
french
accent
was
nevertheless
harsh
and
emotionless
she
spoke
as
an
automaton
slowly
and
pausing
to
choose
her
words
the
woman
was
of
medium
size
slim
and
straight
in
spite
of
many
years
her
skin
resembled
brown
parchment
her
eyes
were
small
black
and
beady
her
nose
somewhat
fleshy
and
her
lips
red
and
full
as
those
of
a
young
girl
the
age
of
madame
cerise
might
be
anywhere
between
fifty
and
seventy
assuredly
she
had
long
been
a
stranger
to
youth
although
her
dark
hair
was
but
slightly
streaked
with
gray
she
wore
a
gown
and
a
maid
jaunty
apron
and
cap
louise
inspected
her
closely
longing
to
find
a
friend
and
protector
in
this
curious
and
strange
woman
her
eyes
were
moist
and
pleading
an
appeal
hard
to
resist
but
madame
cerise
returned
her
scrutiny
with
a
wholly
impassive
expression
you
are
a
french
maid
asked
louise
softly
a
housekeeper
for
a
time
a
caretaker
ah
i
understand
are
your
employers
asleep
i
can
not
say
they
are
not
here
you
are
alone
in
this
house
alone
with
you
louise
had
a
sudden
access
of
alarm
and
why
am
i
here
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
pitifully
ah
who
can
tell
that
returned
the
woman
composedly
not
cerise
indeed
cerise
is
told
nothing
except
what
is
required
of
her
i
but
obey
my
orders
louise
turned
quickly
at
this
what
are
your
orders
then
she
asked
to
attend
with
my
best
skill
to
give
her
every
comfort
and
care
to
yes
yes
to
keep
her
safely
until
she
is
called
for
that
is
all
the
girl
drew
a
long
breath
who
will
call
for
me
then
i
am
not
inform
and
i
am
a
prisoner
in
this
house
may
call
it
so
if
it
please
her
but
reflect
there
is
no
place
else
to
go
it
is
bleak
weather
the
winter
soon
comes
and
here
i
can
make
you
the
comforts
you
need
louise
pondered
this
speech
which
did
not
deceive
her
while
still
perplexed
as
to
her
abduction
with
no
comprehension
why
she
should
have
been
seized
in
such
a
summary
manner
and
spirited
to
this
lonely
place
she
realized
she
was
in
no
immediate
danger
her
weariness
returned
tenfold
and
she
staggered
and
caught
the
back
of
a
chair
for
support
the
old
woman
observed
this
is
tired
said
she
see
it
is
past
four
by
the
clock
and
you
must
be
much
fatigue
by
the
ride
and
the
nervous
strain
i
i
completely
exhausted
murmured
louise
drooping
her
head
wearily
the
next
moment
she
ran
and
placed
her
hands
on
madame
shoulders
peering
into
the
round
beady
eyes
with
tender
pleading
as
she
continued
i
do
know
why
i
have
been
stolen
away
from
my
home
and
friends
i
do
know
why
this
dreadful
thing
has
happened
to
me
i
only
know
that
i
am
worn
out
and
need
rest
will
you
take
care
of
me
madame
cerise
will
you
watch
over
me
while
i
sleep
and
guard
me
from
all
harm
i
i
have
any
mother
to
lean
on
now
you
know
i
any
friend
at
all
but
the
grim
features
never
relaxed
a
muscle
but
a
softer
look
came
into
the
dark
eyes
and
the
woman
voice
took
on
a
faint
tinge
of
compassion
as
she
answered
nothing
can
harm
have
no
fear
i
will
take
care
of
you
i
will
watch
it
is
my
duty
it
is
also
my
pleasure
are
there
no
no
men
in
the
house
none
at
all
enquired
the
girl
peering
into
the
surrounding
gloom
nervously
there
is
no
person
at
all
in
the
house
but
you
and
i
and
you
will
admit
no
one
the
woman
hesitated
not
to
your
apartment
she
said
firmly
i
promise
it
louise
gave
a
long
fluttering
sigh
somehow
she
felt
that
she
could
rely
upon
this
promise
then
if
you
please
madame
cerise
i
like
to
go
to
bed
she
said
the
woman
took
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
upstairs
entering
a
large
airy
chamber
in
which
a
fire
burned
brightly
in
the
grate
the
furniture
here
was
dainty
and
feminine
in
an
alcove
stood
a
snowy
bed
the
covers
invitingly
turned
down
madame
cerise
set
the
lamp
upon
a
table
and
without
a
word
turned
to
assist
louise
the
beautiful
kermess
costume
elaborately
embroidered
with
roses
which
the
girl
still
wore
evidently
won
the
approval
she
unhooked
and
removed
it
carefully
and
hung
it
in
a
closet
very
dextrous
were
her
motions
as
she
took
down
the
girl
pretty
hair
and
braided
it
for
the
night
a
dainty
de
was
provided
it
is
my
own
she
said
simply
is
not
prepared
but
there
must
be
young
ladies
in
your
family
remarked
louise
thoughtfully
for
in
spite
of
the
stupor
she
felt
from
want
of
sleep
the
novelty
of
her
position
kept
her
alert
in
a
way
it
is
true
she
was
too
tired
and
bewildered
to
think
clearly
but
slight
details
were
impressing
themselves
upon
her
dimly
this
room
for
instance
of
course
a
young
lady
has
lived
here
she
has
left
some
odd
pieces
of
wardrobe
behind
her
at
times
in
going
away
when
you
waken
we
will
try
to
find
a
to
replace
your
will
indulge
in
the
bath
before
retiring
not
madame
cerise
i
too
tired
for
anything
but
sleep
indeed
she
had
no
sooner
crawled
into
the
enticing
bed
than
she
sank
into
unconscious
forgetfulness
this
was
to
an
extent
fortunate
louise
possessed
one
of
those
dispositions
cheery
and
equable
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
easily
crushed
into
apathy
by
any
sudden
adversity
she
would
not
suffer
so
much
as
a
more
excitable
and
nervous
girl
might
do
under
similar
circumstances
her
sleep
following
the
severe
strain
of
the
night
adventure
did
little
to
refresh
her
she
awoke
in
broad
daylight
to
hear
a
cold
wind
whistling
shrilly
outside
and
raindrops
beating
against
the
panes
madame
cerise
had
not
slept
much
during
the
night
for
an
hour
after
louise
retired
she
sat
in
her
room
in
deep
thought
then
she
went
to
the
telephone
and
notwithstanding
the
late
hour
called
up
diana
who
had
a
branch
telephone
on
a
table
at
her
bedside
miss
von
taer
was
not
asleep
she
had
had
an
exciting
night
herself
she
answered
the
old
caretaker
readily
and
it
did
not
surprise
her
to
learn
that
the
missing
girl
had
been
taken
to
the
east
orange
house
by
the
orders
of
charlie
mershone
she
enquired
how
louise
had
accepted
the
situation
forced
upon
her
and
was
shocked
and
rendered
uncomfortable
by
the
too
plainly
worded
protest
of
the
old
frenchwoman
madame
cerise
did
not
hesitate
to
denounce
the
abduction
as
a
heartless
crime
and
in
her
communication
with
diana
swore
she
would
protect
the
innocent
girl
from
harm
at
the
hands
of
mershone
or
anyone
else
i
have
ever
to
your
family
been
loyal
and
true
diana
said
she
but
i
will
not
become
the
instrument
of
an
abominable
crime
at
your
command
or
that
of
your
wicked
cousin
i
will
keep
the
girl
here
in
safety
if
it
is
your
wish
but
she
will
be
safe
indeed
as
long
as
cerise
guards
her
that
right
madame
stammered
diana
hardly
knowing
at
the
moment
what
to
say
be
discreet
and
silent
until
you
hear
from
me
again
guard
the
girl
carefully
and
see
that
she
is
not
too
unhappy
but
for
sake
keep
charlie
secret
until
he
sees
fit
to
restore
miss
merrick
to
her
friends
no
crime
is
contemplated
i
would
not
allow
such
a
thing
as
you
know
yet
it
is
none
of
my
affair
whatever
my
cousin
has
compromised
me
by
taking
the
girl
to
my
house
and
no
knowledge
of
the
abduction
must
get
abroad
if
we
can
help
it
do
you
understand
me
no
was
the
reply
the
safest
way
for
us
all
is
to
send
miss
merrick
away
that
will
be
done
as
soon
as
possible
with
this
the
old
frenchwoman
was
forced
to
be
content
and
she
did
not
suspect
that
her
report
had
made
miss
von
taer
nearly
frantic
with
fear
not
for
louise
but
for
her
own
precious
reputation
accustomed
to
obey
the
family
she
had
served
for
so
many
years
madame
cerise
hesitated
to
follow
her
natural
impulse
to
set
the
poor
young
lady
free
and
assist
her
to
return
to
her
friends
so
she
compromised
with
her
conscience
a
thing
she
was
not
credited
with
possessing
by
resolving
to
make
the
imprisonment
of
the
as
happy
as
possible
scarcely
had
louise
opened
her
eyes
the
following
morning
when
the
old
woman
entered
her
chamber
unlocking
the
door
from
the
outside
to
secure
admission
she
first
rebuilt
the
fire
and
when
it
was
crackling
cheerfully
she
prepared
a
bath
and
brought
an
armful
of
clothing
which
she
laid
out
for
inspection
over
the
back
of
a
sofa
she
produced
lingerie
too
and
louise
lay
cuddled
up
in
the
bedclothes
and
watched
her
keeper
thoughtfully
until
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
sufficiently
warmed
i
get
up
now
she
said
quietly
madame
cerise
was
assuredly
a
skilled
lady
maid
she
bathed
the
girl
wrapped
her
in
an
ample
kimono
and
then
seated
her
before
the
dresser
and
arranged
her
with
dextrous
skill
during
this
time
louise
talked
she
had
decided
her
only
chance
of
escape
lay
in
conciliating
this
woman
and
she
began
by
relating
her
entire
history
including
her
love
affair
with
arthur
weldon
diana
von
taer
attempt
to
rob
her
of
her
lover
and
the
part
that
charlie
mershone
had
taken
in
the
affair
madame
cerise
listened
but
said
nothing
and
now
continued
the
girl
tell
me
who
you
think
could
be
so
wicked
and
cruel
as
to
carry
me
away
from
my
home
and
friends
i
can
not
decide
myself
you
have
more
experience
and
more
shrewdness
ca
you
tell
me
madame
cerise
the
woman
muttered
inaudibly
mershone
might
be
an
enemy
because
i
laughed
at
his
continued
louise
musingly
would
a
man
who
loved
a
girl
try
to
injure
her
but
perhaps
his
love
has
turned
to
hate
anyhow
i
can
think
of
no
one
else
who
would
do
such
a
thing
or
of
any
reason
why
charlie
mershone
should
do
it
madame
cerise
merely
grunted
she
was
brushing
the
soft
hair
with
gentle
care
what
could
a
man
gain
by
stealing
a
girl
if
it
was
mershone
does
he
imagine
i
could
ever
forget
arthur
or
cease
to
love
him
or
that
arthur
would
forget
me
while
i
am
away
perhaps
it
diana
and
she
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
so
she
can
coax
arthur
back
to
her
side
but
that
nonsense
is
it
madame
cerise
no
girl
not
even
diana
von
taer
would
dare
to
act
in
such
a
manner
toward
her
rival
did
you
ever
hear
of
miss
von
taer
she
quite
a
society
belle
have
you
ever
seen
her
madame
cerise
the
woman
vouchsafed
no
reply
to
this
direct
enquiry
but
busied
herself
dressing
the
girl
hair
louise
casually
turned
over
the
hand
mirror
she
was
holding
and
gave
a
sudden
start
a
monogram
was
engraved
upon
the
metal
she
gazed
at
the
mark
fixedly
and
then
picked
up
a
brush
that
the
frenchwoman
laid
down
yes
the
same
monogram
appeared
upon
the
brush
the
sharp
eyes
of
cerise
had
noted
these
movements
she
was
a
little
dismayed
but
not
startled
when
louise
said
slowly
stands
for
diana
von
taer
and
it
is
likely
to
stand
for
anything
else
i
think
the
mystery
is
explained
now
and
my
worst
fears
are
realized
tell
me
madame
is
this
diana
von
taer
house
her
eyes
shone
with
anger
and
round
red
patches
suddenly
appeared
upon
her
pallid
cheeks
madame
cerise
drew
a
long
breath
it
used
to
be
was
her
quiet
answer
it
was
left
her
by
her
grandmother
but
mr
von
taer
did
not
like
the
place
and
they
have
not
been
here
lately
not
for
years
miss
von
taer
informed
me
some
time
ago
that
she
had
transferred
the
property
to
another
to
her
cousin
mr
mershone
asked
louise
quickly
that
may
be
the
name
i
can
not
remember
was
the
evasive
reply
but
you
must
know
him
as
he
is
diana
cousin
retorted
louise
why
will
you
try
to
deceive
me
am
i
not
helpless
enough
already
and
do
you
wish
to
make
me
still
more
miserable
i
have
seen
mershone
when
he
was
a
boy
many
times
he
was
not
the
favorite
with
diana
nor
with
monsieur
von
taer
for
myself
i
hated
him
there
was
decided
emphasis
to
the
last
sentence
louise
believed
her
and
felt
a
little
relieved
from
the
of
apparel
a
modest
outfit
was
obtained
to
clothe
the
girl
with
decency
and
comfort
if
not
in
the
prevailing
style
the
fit
left
much
to
be
desired
yet
louise
did
not
complain
as
weightier
matters
were
now
occupying
her
mind
the
toilet
completed
madame
cerise
disappeared
to
get
a
tray
containing
a
good
breakfast
she
seemed
exceedingly
attentive
if
you
will
give
me
the
proper
directions
i
will
start
for
home
at
once
announced
louise
with
firm
resolve
while
eating
her
egg
and
toast
i
am
unable
to
give
you
directions
and
i
can
not
let
you
go
was
the
equally
firm
reply
the
day
is
much
too
disagreeable
to
venture
out
in
unless
one
has
proper
conveyance
here
alas
no
conveyance
may
be
had
louise
tried
other
tactics
i
have
no
money
but
several
valuable
jewels
she
said
meaningly
i
am
quite
sure
they
will
obtain
for
me
a
conveyance
you
are
wrong
there
is
no
conveyance
to
be
had
persisted
the
old
woman
more
sternly
then
i
shall
walk
it
is
impossible
where
is
this
place
situated
how
far
is
it
from
new
york
how
near
am
i
to
a
or
to
a
train
i
can
not
tell
you
but
this
is
absurd
cried
louise
you
can
not
deceive
me
for
long
i
know
this
is
diana
von
taer
house
and
i
shall
hold
diana
von
taer
responsible
for
this
enforced
imprisonment
that
said
madame
cerise
coldly
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
but
must
understand
one
thing
she
must
not
leave
this
house
oh
indeed
at
least
until
the
weather
moderates
added
the
woman
more
mildly
she
picked
up
the
tray
went
to
the
door
and
passed
out
louise
heard
the
key
click
in
the
lock
chapter
xvii
the
mystery
deepens
uncle
john
was
both
astounded
and
indignant
that
so
bold
and
unlawful
an
act
as
the
abduction
of
his
own
niece
could
have
been
perpetrated
in
the
heart
of
new
york
and
directly
under
the
eyes
of
the
police
urged
by
the
major
merrick
was
at
first
inclined
to
allow
arthur
weldon
to
prosecute
the
affair
and
undertake
the
recovery
of
the
girl
being
assured
this
would
easily
be
accomplished
and
conceding
the
fact
that
no
one
had
a
stronger
interest
in
solving
the
mystery
of
disappearance
than
young
weldon
but
when
midday
arrived
and
no
trace
of
the
young
girl
had
yet
been
obtained
the
little
millionaire
assumed
an
important
and
decisive
air
and
hurried
down
town
to
take
a
hand
in
the
game
himself
after
a
long
interview
with
the
chief
of
detectives
merrick
said
impressively
now
understand
sir
not
a
hint
of
this
to
the
newspaper
folks
i
wo
have
any
scandal
attached
to
the
poor
child
if
i
can
help
it
set
your
whole
force
to
work
at
once
but
impress
them
with
the
need
of
secrecy
my
offer
is
fair
and
square
i
give
a
reward
of
ten
thousand
dollars
if
miss
merrick
is
discovered
within
hours
nine
thousand
if
she
found
during
the
next
hours
and
so
on
deducting
a
thousand
for
each
day
of
delay
that
for
the
officer
who
finds
her
for
yourself
sir
i
intend
to
express
my
gratitude
as
liberally
as
the
service
will
allow
me
to
is
this
all
clear
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
mr
merrick
the
child
must
be
found
and
found
blamed
quick
too
great
caesar
can
a
simple
affair
like
this
baffle
your
splendid
metropolitan
force
not
for
long
merrick
believe
me
but
this
assurance
proved
optimistic
day
by
day
crept
by
without
a
clew
to
the
missing
girl
being
discovered
without
development
of
any
sort
the
inspector
informed
merrick
that
it
began
to
look
like
a
mystery
arthur
even
after
several
sleepless
nights
still
retained
his
courage
i
on
the
right
track
sir
he
told
uncle
john
the
delay
is
annoying
but
not
at
all
dangerous
so
long
as
fogerty
holds
fast
to
mershone
louise
is
safe
wherever
she
may
be
mershone
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
i
positive
he
has
and
louise
ca
be
safe
while
she
a
prisoner
and
in
the
hands
of
strangers
i
want
the
girl
home
then
i
know
she
safe
i
want
her
home
too
sir
but
all
your
men
are
unable
to
find
her
it
seems
they
ca
even
discover
in
what
direction
she
was
taken
or
how
the
brown
limousine
seems
to
be
no
due
at
all
of
course
not
there
are
a
thousand
brown
limousines
in
new
york
do
you
imagine
she
still
somewhere
in
the
city
sir
enquired
arthur
that
my
theory
replied
uncle
john
she
must
be
somewhere
in
the
city
you
see
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
get
her
out
of
town
without
discovery
but
i
admit
this
detective
force
is
the
finest
aggregation
of
incompetents
i
ever
known
and
i
do
believe
your
precious
fogerty
is
any
better
either
of
course
beth
and
patsy
had
to
be
told
of
their
cousin
disappearance
as
soon
as
the
first
endeavor
to
trace
her
proved
a
failure
patsy
went
at
once
to
merrick
and
devoted
herself
to
comforting
the
poor
woman
as
well
as
she
could
beth
frowned
at
the
news
and
then
sat
down
to
carefully
think
out
the
problem
in
an
hour
she
had
logically
concluded
that
diana
von
taer
was
the
proper
person
to
appeal
to
if
anyone
knew
where
louise
was
it
was
diana
that
same
afternoon
she
drove
to
the
von
taer
residence
and
demanded
an
interview
diana
was
at
that
moment
in
a
highly
nervous
state
she
had
at
times
during
her
career
been
calculating
and
unscrupulous
but
never
before
had
she
deserved
the
accusation
of
being
malicious
and
wicked
she
had
come
to
reproach
herself
bitterly
for
having
weakly
connived
at
the
desperate
act
of
charlie
mershone
and
her
good
sense
assured
her
the
result
would
be
disastrous
to
all
concerned
in
it
contempt
for
herself
and
contempt
for
her
cousin
mingled
with
fears
for
her
cherished
reputation
and
so
it
was
that
miss
von
taer
had
almost
decided
to
telephone
madame
cerise
and
order
her
to
escort
louise
merrick
to
her
own
home
when
beth
card
came
up
with
a
curt
demand
for
a
personal
interview
the
natures
of
these
two
girls
had
never
harmonized
in
the
slightest
degree
beth
presence
nerved
diana
to
a
spirit
of
antagonism
that
quickly
destroyed
her
repentant
mood
as
she
confronted
her
visitor
her
demeanor
was
cold
and
suspicious
there
was
a
challenge
and
an
accusation
in
beth
eyes
that
conveyed
a
distinct
warning
which
miss
von
taer
quickly
noted
and
angrily
resented
perhaps
because
she
knew
it
was
deserved
it
would
have
been
easy
to
tell
beth
de
graf
where
her
cousin
louise
was
and
at
the
same
time
to
assure
her
that
diana
was
blameless
in
the
affair
but
she
could
not
endure
to
give
her
antagonist
this
satisfaction
beth
began
the
interview
by
saying
what
have
you
done
with
louise
merrick
that
was
of
course
equal
to
a
declaration
of
war
diana
was
sneering
and
scornful
thoroughly
on
guard
she
permitted
no
compromising
word
or
admission
to
escape
her
really
she
knew
nothing
of
louise
merrick
having
unfortunately
neglected
to
examine
her
antecedents
and
personal
characteristics
before
undertaking
her
acquaintance
one
is
so
likely
to
blunder
through
excess
of
good
nature
she
had
supposed
a
niece
of
john
merrick
would
be
of
the
right
sort
but
the
age
is
peculiar
and
one
can
not
be
too
cautious
in
choosing
associates
if
miss
merrick
had
run
away
from
her
home
and
friends
miss
von
taer
was
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
escapade
and
now
if
miss
de
graf
had
nothing
further
to
say
more
important
matters
demanded
time
beth
was
furious
with
anger
at
this
baiting
without
abandoning
a
jot
her
suspicions
she
realized
she
was
powerless
to
prove
her
case
at
this
time
with
a
few
bitter
and
cutting
remarks
made
she
afterward
said
in
she
retreated
as
gracefully
as
possible
and
drove
home
an
hour
later
she
suggested
to
uncle
john
that
he
have
a
detective
placed
where
diana
movements
could
be
watched
but
that
had
already
been
attended
to
by
both
merrick
and
fogerty
uncle
john
could
hardly
credit
diana
complicity
in
this
affair
the
young
lady
social
position
was
so
high
her
family
so
eminently
respectable
her
motive
in
harming
louise
so
inconceivable
that
he
hesitated
to
believe
her
guilty
even
indirectly
as
for
her
cousin
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
as
arthur
accused
him
unreservedly
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
any
man
of
birth
breeding
and
social
position
could
be
so
contemptible
as
to
perpetrate
an
act
of
this
character
yet
some
one
had
done
it
and
who
had
a
greater
incentive
than
charlie
mershone
poor
merrick
was
inconsolable
as
the
days
dragged
by
she
clung
to
patsy
with
pitiful
entreaties
not
to
be
left
alone
so
miss
doyle
brought
her
to
her
own
apartments
where
the
bereft
woman
was
shown
every
consideration
vain
and
selfish
though
merrick
might
be
she
was
passionately
devoted
to
her
only
child
and
her
fears
for
the
life
and
safety
of
louise
were
naturally
greatly
exaggerated
the
group
of
anxious
relatives
and
friends
canvassed
the
subject
morning
noon
and
night
and
the
longer
the
mystery
remained
unsolved
the
more
uneasy
they
all
became
this
said
uncle
john
sternly
as
he
sat
one
evening
facing
merrick
is
the
final
result
of
your
foolish
ambition
to
get
our
girls
into
society
i
ca
see
it
that
way
john
wailed
the
poor
woman
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
happening
in
society
before
have
you
i
do
keep
posted
he
growled
but
everything
was
moving
smoothly
with
us
before
this
confounded
social
stunt
began
as
you
must
admit
i
ca
understand
why
the
papers
are
not
full
of
it
sighed
merrick
musingly
louise
is
so
prominent
now
in
the
best
circles
of
course
said
the
major
drily
she
so
prominent
that
no
one
can
discover
her
at
all
and
it
lucky
for
us
the
newspapers
know
nothing
of
the
calamity
they
twist
the
thing
into
so
many
shapes
that
not
one
of
us
would
ever
again
dare
to
look
a
friend
in
the
eye
i
sure
my
darling
has
been
murdered
declared
merrick
weeping
miserably
she
made
the
statement
on
an
average
of
once
to
every
five
minutes
or
if
she
has
been
killed
yet
she
sure
to
be
soon
ca
be
done
that
last
appeal
was
hard
to
answer
they
had
done
everything
that
could
be
thought
of
and
here
it
was
tuesday
louise
had
been
missing
for
five
days
chapter
xviii
a
rift
in
the
clouds
the
tuesday
morning
just
referred
to
dawned
cold
and
wintry
a
chill
wind
blew
and
for
a
time
carried
isolated
snowflakes
whirling
here
and
there
gradually
as
the
morning
advanced
the
flakes
became
more
numerous
until
by
nine
an
old
fashioned
snowstorm
had
set
in
that
threatened
to
last
for
some
time
the
frozen
ground
was
soon
covered
with
a
thin
white
mantle
and
the
landscape
in
city
and
country
seemed
especially
forbidding
in
spite
of
these
adverse
conditions
charlie
mershone
decided
to
go
out
for
a
walk
he
felt
much
like
a
prisoner
and
his
only
recreation
was
in
getting
out
of
the
hotel
for
a
daily
stroll
moreover
he
had
an
object
in
going
abroad
so
he
buttoned
his
overcoat
up
to
his
chin
and
fearlessly
braved
the
storm
he
had
come
to
wholly
disregard
the
presence
of
the
detective
who
shadowed
him
and
if
the
youthful
fogerty
by
chance
addressed
him
he
was
rewarded
with
a
direct
snub
this
did
not
seem
to
disconcert
the
boy
in
the
least
and
as
usual
when
mershone
walked
out
fogerty
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
he
never
appeared
to
be
watching
his
man
closely
yet
never
for
an
instant
did
mershone
feel
that
he
had
shaken
the
fellow
off
on
this
especial
morning
the
detective
was
nearly
a
block
in
the
rear
with
the
snow
driving
furiously
into
his
face
when
an
automobile
suddenly
rolled
up
to
the
curb
beside
him
and
two
men
leaped
out
and
pinioned
fogerty
in
their
arms
there
was
no
struggle
because
there
was
no
resistance
the
captors
quickly
tossed
the
detective
into
the
car
an
open
one
which
again
started
and
turned
into
a
side
street
fogerty
seated
securely
between
the
two
burly
fellows
managed
to
straighten
up
and
rearrange
his
clothing
will
you
kindly
explain
this
unlawful
act
gentlemen
he
enquired
the
man
on
the
left
laughed
aloud
he
was
the
same
individual
who
had
attacked
arthur
weldon
the
one
who
had
encountered
mershone
in
the
street
the
day
before
cold
day
ai
it
fogerty
he
remarked
but
that
makes
it
all
the
better
for
a
little
auto

good
eh
pete
that
the
idea
responded
pete
cheerfully
very
kind
of
you
said
the
detective
leaning
back
comfortably
against
the
cushions
and
pulling
up
his
coat
collar
to
shield
him
from
the
wind
but
are
you
aware
that
i
on
duty
and
that
this
will
allow
my
man
to
slip
away
from
me

reply

years
ago
for
knocking
out
a
policeman
i
safe
enough
now
though
responded
big
bill
you
not
working
on
the
force
fogerty
you
only
a
private
burr
i
am
protected
just
the
same
asserted
fogerty
when
you
knabbed
me
i
was
shadowing
mershone
who
has
made
away
with
a
prominent
society
young
lady
oh
he
has
has
he
chuckled
big
bill
and
his
companion
laughed
so
gleefully
that
he
attracted
fogerty
attention
to
himself
ah
i
suppose
you
are
one
of
the
two
men
who
lugged
the
girl
off
he
remarked
and
i
must
congratulate
you
on
having
made
a
good
job
of
it
is
it
curious
by
the
way
that
the
fellow
who
stole
and
hid
this
girl
should
be
the
innocent
means
of
revealing
her
biding
place
the
two
men
stared
at
him
blankly
the
car
during
this
conversation
had
moved
steadily
on
turning
this
and
that
corner
in
a
way
that
might
have
confused
anyone
not
perfectly
acquainted
with
this
section
of
the
city
what
d
mean
by
that
talk
fogerty
demanded
big
bill
of
course
it
was
mershone
who
stole
the
girl
explained
the
detective
calmly
we
know
that
but
mershone
is
a
clever
chap
he
knew
he
was
watched
and
so
he
has
never
made
a
movement
to
go
to
his
prisoner
but
he
grew
restless
in
time
and
when
he
met
you
yesterday
fixed
up
a
deal
with
you
to
carry
me
away
so
he
could
escape
big
bill
looked
uncomfortable
you
know
a
lot
fogerty
he
said
doggedly
yes
i
found
that
human
nature
is
much
the
same
the
world
over
replied
the
detective
of
course
i
suspected
you
would
undertake
to
give
mershone
his
chance
by
grabbing
me
and
that
is
exactly
what
you
have
done
but
my
lads
what
do
you
suppose
i
have
done
in
the
meantime
they
both
looked
their
curiosity
but
said
nothing
i
simply
used
your
clever
plot
to
my
own
advantage
in
order
to
bring
things
to
a
climax
continued
fogerty
while
we
are
here
a
half
dozen
of
my
men
are
watching
every
move
that
mershone
makes
i
believe
he
will
lead
them
straight
to
the
girl
do
you
big
bill
growled
some
words
that
were
not
very
choice
and
then
yelled
to
the
chauffeur
to
stop
the
other
man
was
pale
and
evidently
frightened
see
here
fogerty
you
make
tracks
was
the
sharp
command
as
the
automobile
came
to
a
halt
you
worked
a
pretty
trick
on
us
to
your
own
showin
and
we
must
find
mershone
before
it
too
late
if
we
can
good
morning
said
fogerty
alighting
thank
you
for
a
pleasant
ride
and
other
things
they
dashed
away
and
left
him
standing
on
the
curb
and
after
watching
them
disappear
the
detective
walked
over
to
a
drug
store
and
entered
the
telephone
booth
that
you
hyde
this
is
fogerty
yes
sir
mershone
has
just
crossed
the
ferry
to
jersey
adams
is
with
him
i
hear
from
him
again
in
a
minute
hold
the
wire
fogerty
waited
soon
he
learned
that
mershone
had
purchased
a
ticket
for
east
orange
the
train
would
leave
in
fifteen
minutes
fogerty
decided
quickly
after
looking
at
his
watch
he
rushed
out
and
arrested
a
passing
taxicab
ready
for
a
quick
run
perhaps
a
long
one
he
asked
ready
for
anything
declared
the
man
the
detective
jumped
in
and
gave
hurried
directions
never
mind
the
speed
limit
he
said
no
one
will
interfere

politic
repentance
perhaps
no
one
not
even
merrick
was
so
unhappy
in
consequence
of
the
lamentable
crime
that
had
been
committed
as
diana
von
taer
immediately
after
her
interview
with
beth
her
mood
changed
and
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
be
free
from
complicity
in
the
abduction
bitterly
indeed
she
reproached
herself
for
her
enmity
toward
the
unsuspecting
girl
an
innocent
victim
of
diana
own
vain
desires
and
charles
mershone
heartless
wiles
repenting
her
folly
and
reasoning
out
the
thing
when
it
was
too
late
diana
saw
clearly
that
she
had
gained
no
possible
advantage
but
had
thoughtlessly
conspired
to
ruin
the
reputation
of
an
honest
ingenuous
girl
not
long
ago
she
had
said
that
her
life
was
dull
a
stupid
round
of
social
functions
that
bored
her
dreadfully
she
had
hoped
by
adopting
john
merrick
nieces
as
her
and
introducing
them
to
society
to
find
a
novel
and
pleasurable
excitement
that
would
serve
to
take
her
out
of
her
unfortunate
a
condition
to
which
she
had
practically
been
born
but
diana
had
never
bargained
for
such
excitement
as
this
she
had
never
thought
to
win
self
abhorrence
by
acts
of
petty
malice
and
callous
cruelties
yet
so
intrenched
was
she
in
the
conservatism
of
her
class
that
she
could
not
at
once
bring
herself
to
the
point
of
exposing
her
own
guilt
that
she
might
make
amends
for
what
had
been
done
she
told
herself
she
would
rather
die
than
permit
louise
to
suffer
through
her
connivance
with
her
reckless
unprincipled
cousin
she
realized
perfectly
that
she
ought
to
fly
without
a
moment
delay
to
the
poor
girl
assistance
yet
fear
of
exposure
of
ridicule
of
loss
of
caste
held
her
a
helpless
prisoner
in
her
own
home
where
she
paced
the
floor
and
moaned
and
wrung
her
hands
until
she
was
on
the
verge
of
nervous
prostration
if
at
any
time
she
seemed
to
acquire
sufficient
courage
to
go
to
louise
a
glance
at
the
detective
watching
the
house
unnerved
her
and
prevented
her
from
carrying
out
her
good
intentions
you
must
not
believe
that
diana
was
really
bad
her
lifelong
training
along
set
lines
and
practical
seclusion
from
the
everyday
world
were
largely
responsible
for
her
evil
impulses
mischief
is
sure
to
crop
up
in
one
form
or
another
among
the
idle
and
ambitionless
more
daring
wickedness
is
said
to
be
accomplished
by
the
wealthy
and
aimless
creatures
of
our
false
society
than
by
the
poorer
and
uneducated
classes
wherein
criminals
are
supposed
to
thrive
these
sins
are
often
unpublished
although
not
always
undiscovered
but
they
are
no
more
venial
because
they
are
suppressed
by
wealth
and
power
diana
von
taer
was
a
girl
who
rightly
led
might
have
been
capable
of
developing
a
noble
womanhood
yet
the
conditions
of
her
limited
environment
had
induced
her
to
countenance
a
most
dastardly
and
despicable
act
it
speaks
well
for
the
innate
goodness
of
this
girl
that
she
at
last
actually
rebelled
and
resolved
to
undo
insofar
as
she
was
able
the
wrong
that
had
been
accomplished
for
four
days
she
suffered
tortures
of
remorse
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
she
firmly
decided
to
act
regardless
of
who
might
be
watching
or
of
any
unpleasant
consequences
to
herself
she
quietly
left
the
house
unattended
and
started
directly
for
the
east
orange
mansion
chapter
xx
a
telephone
call
still
another
laggard
awoke
to
action
on
this
eventful
tuesday
morning
madame
cerise
had
been
growing
more
and
more
morose
and
dissatisfied
day
by
day
her
grievance
was
very
tangible
a
young
girl
had
been
brought
forcibly
to
the
house
and
placed
in
her
care
to
be
treated
as
a
prisoner
from
that
time
the
perpetrators
of
the
deed
had
left
the
woman
to
her
own
resources
never
communicating
with
her
in
any
way
during
a
long
life
of
servitude
madame
cerise
had
acquiesced
in
many
things
that
her
own
conscience
did
not
approve
of
for
she
considered
herself
a
mere
instrument
to
be
used
at
will
by
the
people
who
employed
and
paid
her
but
her
enforced
solitude
as
caretaker
of
the
lonely
house
at
east
orange
had
given
her
ample
time
to
think
and
her
views
had
lately
undergone
a
decided
change
to
become
the
jailer
of
a
young
pretty
and
innocent
girl
was
the
most
severe
trial
her
faithfulness
to
her
employers
had
ever
compelled
her
to
undergo
and
the
woman
deeply
resented
the
doubtful
position
in
which
she
had
been
placed
however
the
chances
were
that
madame
cerise
might
have
obeyed
her
orders
to
the
letter
had
not
so
long
a
period
of
waiting
ensued
during
these
days
she
was
constantly
thrown
in
the
society
of
louise
which
had
a
tendency
to
make
her
still
more
rebellious
the
girl
clung
to
cerise
in
her
helplessness
and
despair
and
constantly
implored
her
to
set
her
free
this
indeed
the
frenchwoman
might
have
done
long
ago
had
she
not
suspected
such
an
act
might
cause
great
embarrassment
to
diana
von
taer
whom
she
had
held
on
her
knee
as
an
infant
and
sought
to
protect
with
loyal
affection
it
was
hard
though
to
hear
the
pitiful
appeals
of
the
imprisoned
girl
and
to
realize
how
great
was
the
wrong
that
was
being
done
her
the
old
woman
was
forced
to
set
her
jaws
firmly
and
turn
deaf
ears
to
the
pleadings
in
order
not
to
succumb
to
them
straightway
meantime
she
did
her
duty
conscientiously
she
never
left
louise
room
without
turning
the
key
in
the
lock
and
she
steadfastly
refused
the
girl
permission
to
wander
in
the
other
rooms
of
the
house
the
prison
was
a
real
prison
indeed
but
the
turnkey
sought
to
alleviate
the
prisoner
misery
by
every
means
in
her
power
she
was
indefatigable
in
her
service
keeping
the
room
warm
and
neat
attending
to
the
girl
every
want
and
cooking
her
delicious
meals
while
this
all
tended
to
louise
comfort
it
had
little
affect
in
soothing
her
misery
between
periods
of
weeping
she
sought
to
cajole
the
old
woman
to
release
her
and
at
times
she
succumbed
to
blank
despair
arthur
was
always
in
her
mind
and
she
wondered
why
he
did
not
come
to
rescue
her
every
night
she
stole
softly
from
her
bed
to
try
the
door
hoping
cerise
had
forgotten
to
lock
it
she
examined
her
prison
by
stealth
to
discover
any
possible
way
of
escape
there
were
two
small
windows
and
one
large
one
the
latter
opened
upon
the
roof
of
a
small
porch
but
there
were
no
way
to
descend
from
it
unless
one
used
a
frail
lattice
at
one
end
which
in
summer
probably
supported
a
rose
or
other
vine
louise
shrank
intuitively
from
such
a
desperate
undertaking
unless
some
dreadful
crisis
occurred
she
would
never
dare
trust
herself
to
that
frail
support
yet
it
seemed
the
only
possible
way
of
escape
time
finally
wore
out
the
patience
of
madame
cerise
who
was
unable
longer
to
withstand
louise
pleadings
she
did
not
indicate
by
word
or
look
that
her
attitude
had
changed
but
she
made
a
secret
resolve
to
have
done
with
the
affair
altogether
often
in
their
conversations
the
girl
had
mentioned
arthur
weldon
she
had
given
cerise
his
address
and
telephone
number
and
implored
her
at
least
to
communicate
with
him
and
tell
him
his
sweetheart
was
safe
although
unhappy
this
had
given
the
old
woman
the
clever
idea
on
which
she
finally
acted
by
telephoning
weldon
she
could
give
him
the
information
that
would
lead
to
his
coming
for
louise
without
anyone
knowing
who
it
was
that
had
betrayed
the
secret
this
method
commended
itself
strongly
to
her
as
it
would
save
her
from
any
trouble
or
reproach
leaving
louise
at
breakfast
on
this
tuesday
morning
madame
cerise
went
down
to
the
telephone
and
was
soon
in
communication
with
arthur
she
told
him
in
a
quiet
tone
that
miss
louise
merrick
was
being
secluded
in
a
suburban
house
near
east
orange
and
described
the
place
so
he
could
easily
find
it
the
young
man
questioned
her
eagerly
but
aside
from
the
information
that
the
girl
was
well
and
uninjured
she
vouchsafed
no
further
comment
it
was
enough
however
arthur
in
wild
excitement
rushed
to
the
rescue
chapter
xxi
the
unexpected
happens
madame
cerise
well
knowing
she
had
accelerated
the
march
of
events
to
a
calmly
sat
herself
down
in
the
little
housekeeper
room
off
the
lower
hall
and
leaving
louise
to
her
moody
solitude
upstairs
awaited
the
inevitable
developments
outside
the
weather
was
cold
and
blustering
the
wind
whirled
its
burden
of
snowflakes
in
every
direction
with
blinding
bewildering
impartiality
it
was
a
bad
day
to
be
out
thought
the
old
frenchwoman
but
a
snowstorm
was
not
likely
to
deter
an
anxious
lover
she
calculated
the
time
it
would
take
monsieur
weldon
to
arrive
at
the
mansion
if
he
was
prompt
and
energetic
he
could
cover
the
distance
in
an
hour
and
a
half
by
train
or
three
hours
by
motor
car
but
he
must
prepare
for
the
journey
and
that
would
consume
some
time
perhaps
she
need
not
expect
him
within
two
hours
at
the
earliest
she
read
to
pass
away
the
time
selecting
a
book
from
a
shelf
of
french
novels
somehow
she
did
not
care
to
face
her
tearful
prisoner
again
until
she
could
restore
the
unhappy
girl
to
the
arms
of
her
true
lover
there
was
still
romance
in
the
soul
of
madame
cerise
however
withered
her
cheeks
might
be
she
was
very
glad
that
at
last
she
had
summoned
courage
to
act
according
to
the
dictates
of
her
heart
eh
what
is
this
a
rumble
of
wheels
over
the
frozen
snow
caused
her
to
glance
at
the
clock
above
the
mantel
not
by
any
possibility
could
monsieur
weldon
arrive
so
soon
who
then
could
it
be
she
sat
motionless
while
the
doorbell
rang
and
rang
again
nothing
must
interfere
with
the
pretty
she
had
so
fondly
anticipated
when
louise
faithful
knight
came
to
her
but
the
one
who
had
just
now
alighted
was
persistent
the
vehicle
had
been
sent
away
she
heard
the
sound
of
receding
wheels
and
the
new
arrival
wanted
to
get
in
the
bell
jerked
and
jangled
unceasingly
for
a
time
and
then
came
a
crash
against
the
door
as
if
a
stalwart
shoulder
was
endeavoring
to
break
it
down
madame
cerise
laid
down
her
book
placed
her
in
the
case
and
slowly
proceeded
down
the
hall
the
door
shook
with
another
powerful
impact
a
voice
cried
out
demanding
admittance
who
is
it
then
she
called
shrilly
open
the
door
confound
you
was
the
irritated
reply
the
woman
reflected
this
was
surely
young
mershone
voice
and
she
had
no
excuse
to
deny
him
admittance
quietly
she
unbolted
the
door
and
allowed
it
to
open
an
inch
while
she
peered
at
the
man
outside
oh
it
is
monsieur
mershone
of
course
it
is
he
roared
forcing
the
door
open
and
stalking
in
who
in
thunder
did
you
think
it
was
a
thousand
pardons
said
cerise
i
must
be
cautious
it
is
your
own
command
that
you
may
be
protected
i
deny
admittance
to
all
that
all
right
said
mershone
gruffly
while
he
stamped
his
feet
upon
the
rug
and
shook
the
snow
from
his
clothing
have
you
any
fire
in
this
beastly
old
refrigerator
i
nearly
frozen
where
miss
merrick
she
is
occupying
diana
room
in
the
west
wing
will
monsieur
please
to
come
this
way
she
led
him
to
her
own
little
room
and
so
engrossed
were
they
that
neither
remembered
he
had
failed
to
rebolt
the
front
door
a
good
fire
burned
in
the
grate
of
cerise
cosy
den
and
mershone
threw
off
his
overcoat
and
warmed
his
hands
as
he
showered
questions
upon
the
old
caretaker
how
is
the
girl
behaving
tears
and
hysterics
at
times
takes
it
hard
eh
she
is
very
unhappy
ever
mention
a
man
named
weldon
often
humph
he
did
not
like
this
report
has
anyone
been
here
to
disturb
you
or
to
make
enquiries
no
one
we
safe
enough
i
guess
it
was
a
mighty
neat
job
cerise
taken
altogether
although
the
fools
have
been
watching
me
night
and
day
that
the
reason
i
did
not
come
sooner
she
made
no
comment
mershone
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
stared
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
has
louise
miss
merrick
you
know
mentioned
my
name
at
all
at
times
in
what
way
with
loathing
and
contempt
he
scowled
at
her
savagely
do
you
think
she
suspects
that
i
carried
her
away
she
seems
to
know
it
absolutely
he
stared
at
the
fire
again
i
got
a
queer
job
on
my
hands
cerise
and
i
rely
on
you
to
help
me
said
he
presently
assuming
a
more
conciliating
manner
perhaps
i
in
a
box
or
a
hole
or
whatever
else
you
like
to
call
it
but
too
late
too
back
down
now
i
must
push
ahead
and
win
you
see
the
case
is
this
i
love
the
girl
and
had
her
brought
here
to
keep
her
from
another
man
by
hook
or
crook
i
going
to
make
her
my
wife
she
take
kindly
to
that
at
first
perhaps
but
i
make
her
happy
in
the
end
in
one
way
this
delay
has
been
a
good
thing
it
must
have
worn
her
out
and
broken
her
spirits
quite
a
bit
eh
she
seems
very
miserable
conceded
the
woman
do
you
find
her
hard
to
manage
does
she
show
much
temper
in
other
words
do
you
suppose
she
put
up
a
fight
madame
cerise
regarded
him
wonderingly
she
is
a
good
girl
was
her
reply
she
loves
with
much
devotion
the
man
from
whom
you
have
stolen
her
i
am
quite
positive
she
will
never
consent
to
become
your
wife
oh
you
are
well
i
intend
she
shall
marry
me
and
that
settles
it
she
unnerved
and
miserable
now
and
i
mean
to
grind
her
down
till
she
has
strength
to
resist
me
that
sounds
hard
i
know
but
it
the
only
way
to
accomplish
my
purpose
after
she
my
wife
i
be
very
kind
to
her
poor
thing
and
teach
her
to
love
me
a
man
can
do
anything
with
a
woman
if
he
sets
about
it
the
right
way
i
not
taking
this
stand
because
i
cruel
cerise
but
because
i
desperate
all
fair
in
love
and
war
you
know
and
this
is
a
bit
of
both
he
was
pacing
the
floor
by
this
time
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
an
anxious
look
upon
his
face
that
belied
his
bombastic
words
the
frenchwoman
expression
was
impassive
her
scorn
for
the
wretch
before
her
was
tempered
with
the
knowledge
that
his
cowardly
plan
was
doomed
to
defeat
it
was
she
who
had
checkmated
him
and
she
was
glad
now
and
again
her
eyes
sought
the
clock
while
she
silently
calculated
the
time
to
elapse
before
arthur
weldon
arrived
there
would
be
a
pretty
scene
then
cerise
would
have
much
enjoyment
in
witnessing
the
encounter
now
then
take
me
to
louise
commanded
mershone
suddenly
she
shrank
back
in
dismay
oh
not
yet
why
not
the
young
lady
is
asleep
she
will
not
waken
for
an
hour
perhaps
two
i
ca
wait
we
waken
her
now
and
give
her
an
idea
of
the
change
of
program
but
no
it
is
outrageous
the
poor
thing
has
but
now
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
after
many
bitter
hours
can
you
not
wait
a
brief
hour
having
waited
five
days
no
take
me
to
her
at
once
as
he
came
toward
her
the
woman
drew
away
i
can
not
she
said
firmly
see
here
cerise
i
intend
to
be
obeyed
i
wo
endure
any
nonsense
at
this
stage
of
the
game
believe
me
he
announced
fiercely
in
order
to
win
there
just
one
way
to
manage
this
affair
and
i
insist
upon
your
following
my
instructions
take
me
to
louise
i
will
not
she
returned
the
eyes
glittering
as
they
met
his
angry
gaze
then
i
go
alone
give
me
the
key
she
did
not
move
nor
did
she
answer
him
at
her
waist
hung
a
small
bunch
of
household
keys
and
this
he
seized
with
a
sudden
movement
and
jerked
loose
from
its
cord
you
miserable
hag
he
muttered
inflamed
with
anger
at
her
opposition
if
you
propose
to
defend
this
girl
and
defy
me
you
find
i
able
to
crush
you
as
i
will
her
while
i
gone
i
expect
you
to
come
to
your
senses
and
decide
to
obey
me
with
these
words
he
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
little
room
and
opened
it
just
outside
stood
fogerty
smiling
genially
glad
to
meet
you
again
mershone
he
said
may
i
come
in
thank
you
while
mershone
stood
bewildered
by
this
unexpected
apparition
the
detective
entered
the
room
closed
the
door
carefully
and
putting
his
back
to
it
bowed
politely
to
madame
cerise
pardon
this
seeming
intrusion
said
he
i
here
on
a
little
matter
of
business
having
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
charles
connoldy
mershone
chapter
xxii
gone
the
grim
face
of
madame
cerise
relaxed
to
allow
a
quaint
smile
to
flit
across
it
she
returned
fogerty
bow
with
a
deep
curtsy
mershone
after
one
brief
exclamation
of
dismay
wrested
from
him
by
surprise
threw
himself
into
the
chair
again
and
stared
at
the
fire
for
a
few
moments
there
was
intense
stillness
in
the
little
room
how
easy
it
is
said
fogerty
in
soft
musing
tones
to
read
thoughts
under
certain
circumstances
you
are
thinking
mershone
that
i
a
boy
and
not
very
strong
while
you
are
an
athlete
and
can
easily
overpower
me
i
have
come
at
a
disagreeable
time
and
all
your
plans
depend
on
your
ability
to
get
rid
of
me
but
i
four
good
men
within
call
who
are
just
now
guarding
the
approaches
to
this
house
they
like
to
come
in
i
know
because
it
very
cold
and
disagreeable
outside
but
suppose
we
allow
them
to
freeze
for
a
time
ah
i
thought
you
agree
with
me
sir
i
overheard
you
say
you
were
about
to
visit
miss
merrick
who
is
confined
in
a
room
upstairs
but
i
like
you
to
postpone
that
while
we
indulge
in
a
little
confidential
chat
together
you
see
the
rang
violently
fogerty
glanced
at
madame
cerise
will
you
see
who
it
is
he
asked
she
arose
at
once
and
left
the
room
mershone
turned
quickly
what
your
price
fogerty
he
asked
meaningly
for
what
for
getting
out
of
here
making
tracks
and
leaving
me
alone
every
man
has
his
price
and
i
trapped
i
willing
to
pay
anything
i
cut
it
out
sir
you
tried
this
once
before
i
not
to
be
bribed
have
you
really
a
warrant
for
my
arrest
i
carried
it
since
friday
it
no
use
mershone
the
game
up
and
you
may
as
well
grin
and
bear
it
mershone
was
about
to
reply
when
the
door
opened
and
diana
von
taer
came
in
with
a
swift
catlike
tread
and
confronted
him
with
flaming
eyes
you
coward
you
low
miserable
scoundrel
how
dare
you
come
here
to
annoy
and
browbeat
that
poor
girl
she
cried
in
clear
cutting
accents
without
noticing
the
presence
of
fogerty
oh
shut
up
di
you
in
it
as
deep
as
i
am
he
retorted
turning
away
with
a
flushed
face
i
not
sir
never
have
i
countenanced
this
wicked
criminal
act
she
declared
i
have
come
here
to
save
louise
from
your
wiles
and
carry
her
back
to
her
friends
i
dare
you
or
your
confederates
with
a
scornful
look
at
the
detective
to
interfere
with
me
in
any
way
then
she
turned
to
cerise
and
continued
where
is
miss
merrick
now
in
your
own
room
come
with
me
then
with
a
defiant
glance
at
mershone
she
turned
haughtily
and
left
the
room
cerise
followed
obediently
somewhat
astonished
at
the
queer
turn
of
events
left
alone
with
mershone
fogerty
chuckled
gleefully
why
it
seems
i
was
needed
after
all
said
he
and
we
both
of
us
taken
a
lot
of
trouble
for
nothing
mershone
the
chances
are
miss
von
taer
would
have
turned
the
trick
in
any
event
do
you
think
so
no
you
do
understand
her
she
would
have
interfered
if
she
had
been
scared
out
growled
the
other
she
sacrificed
me
to
save
herself
that
all
you
may
be
right
about
that
admitted
fogerty
and
then
he
got
up
to
answer
the
which
once
more
rang
violently
an
automobile
stood
outside
and
from
it
an
excited
party
trooped
into
the
hallway
disregarding
the
cutting
wind
and
blinding
snowflakes
that
assailed
them
as
they
passed
in
there
was
arthur
weldon
and
uncle
john
patricia
and
beth
and
all
as
they
saw
the
detective
cried
with
one
voice
where
louise
fogerty
had
just
managed
to
close
the
door
against
the
wintry
blast
when
the
answer
came
from
the
stairway
just
above
she
is
gone
the
voice
was
shrill
and
despairing
and
looking
up
they
saw
diana
standing
dramatically
posed
upon
the
landing
her
hands
clasped
over
her
heart
and
a
look
of
fear
upon
her
face
over
her
shoulder
the
startled
black
eyes
of
old
cerise
peered
down
upon
the
group
below
the
newcomers
were
evidently
bewildered
by
this
reception
they
had
come
to
rescue
louise
whom
they
imagined
confined
in
a
lonely
deserted
villa
with
no
companion
other
than
the
woman
who
guarded
her
arthur
own
detective
opened
the
door
to
them
and
diana
von
taer
whom
they
certainly
did
not
expect
to
meet
here
confronted
them
with
the
thrilling
statement
that
louise
had
gone
arthur
was
the
first
to
recover
his
wits
gone
he
repeated
gone
where
she
had
escaped
run
away
explained
diana
in
real
distress
when
asked
uncle
john
just
now
within
an
hour
was
it
cerise
at
ten
i
left
her
now
she
is
gone
said
the
old
woman
who
appeared
as
greatly
agitated
as
her
mistress
good
gracious
you
do
mean
to
say
she
left
the
house
in
this
storm
exclaimed
patsy
aghast
at
the
very
thought
what
shall
we
do
what
we
do
demanded
beth
eagerly
fogerty
started
up
the
stairs
cerise
turned
to
show
him
the
way
and
the
others
followed
in
an
awed
group
the
key
was
in
the
lock
of
the
door
to
the
missing
girl
room
but
the
door
itself
now
stood
ajar
fogerty
entered
cast
a
sharp
look
around
and
walked
straight
to
the
window
as
the
others
came
in
glancing
curiously
about
them
and
noting
the
still
smouldering
fire
and
the
evidences
of
recent
occupation
the
detective
unlatched
the
french
window
and
stepped
out
into
the
snow
that
covered
the
roof
of
the
little
porch
below
arthur
sprang
out
beside
him
leaving
the
rest
to
shiver
in
the
cold
blast
that
rushed
in
upon
them
from
the
open
window
fogerty
on
his
knees
scanned
the
snow
carefully
and
although
weldon
could
discover
no
sign
of
a
footprint
the
young
detective
nodded
his
head
sagaciously
and
slowly
made
his
way
to
the
trellis
at
the
end
here
it
was
plain
that
the
accumulation
of
snow
had
recently
been
brushed
away
from
the
frail
framework
it
was
strong
enough
to
hold
her
though
declared
fogerty
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
roof
descend
the
same
way
sir
go
back
by
the
stairs
and
meet
me
below
he
grasped
the
lattice
and
began
cautiously
to
lower
himself
to
the
ground
and
arthur
turned
to
rejoin
his
friends
in
the
room
that
is
the
way
she
escaped
without
doubt
he
said
to
them
poor
child
she
had
no
idea
we
were
about
to
rescue
her
and
her
long
confinement
had
made
her
desperate
did
she
have
a
cloak
or
any
warm
clothes
asked
beth
madame
cerise
hurriedly
examined
the
wardrobe
in
the
closets
yes
she
has
taken
a
thick
coat
and
a
knit
scarf
she
answered
but
i
am
sure
she
had
no
gloves
and
her
shoes
were
very
thin
how
long
do
you
think
she
has
been
gone
patsy
enquired
not
more
than
an
hour
i
was
talking
with
mershone
and
mershone
is
he
here
demanded
arthur
he
is
in
my
room
downstairs
or
was
when
you
came
said
the
woman
that
accounts
for
her
sudden
flight
declared
the
young
man
bitterly
she
doubtless
heard
his
voice
and
in
a
sudden
panic
decided
to
fly
did
mershone
see
her
he
asked
no
replied
cerise
with
one
accord
they
descended
to
the
lower
hall
and
the
caretaker
led
the
way
to
her
room
to
their
surprise
they
found
mershone
still
seated
in
the
chair
by
the
fire
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
here
is
another
crime
for
you
to
account
for
cried
arthur
advancing
upon
him
angrily
you
have
driven
louise
to
her
death
mershone
raised
one
hand
in
mild
protest
do
waste
time
cursing
me
he
said
try
to
find
louise
before
it
is
too
late
the
reproach
seemed
justified
arthur
paused
and
turning
to
merrick
said
he
is
right
i
go
help
fogerty
and
you
must
stay
here
and
look
after
the
girls
until
we
return
as
he
went
out
he
passed
diana
without
a
look
she
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
room
sobbing
miserably
beth
was
thoughtful
and
quiet
patsy
nervous
and
indignant
uncle
john
was
apparently
crushed
by
the
disaster
that
had
overtaken
them
suggestion
that
louise
might
perish
in
the
storm
was
no
idle
one
the
girl
was
not
only
frail
and
delicate
but
worn
out
with
her
long
imprisonment
and
its
anxieties
they
all
realized
this
i
believe
said
mershone
rising
abruptly
i
go
and
join
the
search
fogerty
has
arrested
me
but
you
need
worry
about
my
trying
to
escape
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
now
and
i
going
straight
to
join
the
detective
they
allowed
him
to
go
without
protest
and
he
buttoned
his
coat
and
set
out
in
the
storm
to
find
the
others
fogerty
and
arthur
were
by
this
time
in
the
lane
back
of
the
grounds
where
the
detective
was
advancing
slowly
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
the
tracks
are
faint
but
easily
followed
he
was
saying
the
high
heels
of
her
shoes
leave
a
distinct
mark
when
mershone
joined
them
arthur
scowled
at
the
fellow
but
said
nothing
fogerty
merely
smiled
from
the
lane
the
tracks
already
nearly
obliterated
by
the
fast
falling
snow
wandered
along
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
a
crossroads
where
they
became
wholly
lost
fogerty
looked
up
and
down
the
roads
and
shook
his
head
with
a
puzzled
expression
we
surely
traced
her
so
far
said
he
but
now
we
must
guess
at
her
further
direction
you
notice
this
track
of
a
wagon
it
may
have
passed
fifteen
minutes
or
an
hour
ago
the
hoof
tracks
of
the
horses
are
covered
so
i
not
positive
which
way
they
headed
i
only
know
there
are
indications
of
hoof
tracks
which
proves
it
a
farmer
wagon
the
question
is
whether
the
young
lady
met
it
and
caught
a
ride
or
whether
she
proceeded
along
some
of
the
other
trails
i
ca
find
any
indication
of
those
shoes
from
this
point
in
any
direction
better
get
your
car
weldon
and
run
east
a
few
miles
keeping
sharp
watch
of
the
wagon
tracks
on
the
way
it
was
a
heavy
wagon
for
the
wheels
cut
deep
mershone
and
i
will
go
west
when
you
driven
far
enough
to
satisfy
yourself
you
going
the
wrong
direction
you
may
easily
overtake
us
on
your
return
then
if
we
discovered
nothing
on
this
road
we
try
the
other
arthur
ran
back
at
once
to
the
house
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
started
on
his
quest
the
motor
car
was
powerful
enough
to
plow
through
the
deep
snow
with
comparative
ease
those
left
together
in
madam
cerise
little
room
were
more
to
be
pitied
than
the
ones
engaged
in
active
search
for
there
was
nothing
to
relieve
their
fears
and
anxieties
diana
unable
to
bear
the
accusing
looks
of
patsy
and
beth
resolved
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
her
complicity
in
the
affair
and
related
to
them
every
detail
of
her
connection
with
her
cousin
despicable
plot
she
ended
by
begging
their
forgiveness
and
wept
so
miserably
that
uncle
john
found
himself
stroking
her
hair
while
patsy
came
close
and
pressed
the
penitent
girl
hand
as
if
to
comfort
and
reassure
her
beth
said
nothing
she
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
as
yet
to
forgive
diana
selfish
conspiracy
against
her
cousin
happiness
if
louise
perished
in
this
dreadful
storm
the
proud
diana
von
taer
could
not
escape
the
taint
of
murder
the
end

chapter
xxiii
the
crisis
mershone
and
fogerty
plodded
through
the
snow
together
side
by
side
they
were
facing
the
wind
which
cut
their
faces
cruelly
yet
neither
seemed
to
mind
the
bitterness
of
the
weather
keep
watch
along
the
roadside
suggested
mershone
she
may
have
fallen
anywhere
you
know
she
could
endure
this
thing
long
poor
louise
you
were
fond
of
her
mr
mershone
asked
fogerty
not
unsympathetically
yes
that
was
why
i
made
such
a
struggle
to
get
her
it
was
a
mistake
sir
provided
a
woman
is
won
by
force
or
trickery
she
never
worth
getting
if
she
does
care
for
you
it
better
to
give
her
up
i
know
now
you
a
bright
fellow
mershone
a
clever
fellow
it
a
pity
you
could
direct
your
talents
the
right
way
they
jug
you
for
this
never
mind
the
game
of
life
is
worth
playing
i
done
with
it
and
the
sooner
i
go
to
the
devil
the
better
if
only
i
could
be
sure
louise
was
safe
i
toss
every
care
and
every
honest
thought
to
the
winds
from
this
moment
during
the
silence
that
followed
fogerty
was
thoughtful
indeed
his
mind
dwelt
more
upon
the
defeated
and
desperate
man
beside
him
than
upon
the
waif
he
was
searching
for
what
been
done
mershone
he
said
after
a
time
ca
be
helped
now
the
future
of
every
man
is
always
a
bigger
proposition
than
his
past
whoever
he
may
be
with
your
talents
and
genius
you
could
yet
make
of
yourself
a
successful
and
prosperous
man
respected
by
the
community
if
you
could
get
out
of
this
miserable
rut
that
has
helped
to
drag
you
down
but
i
ca
said
the
other
despondently
you
can
if
you
try
but
you
have
to
strike
for
a
place
a
good
way
from
new
york
go
west
forget
your
past
and
carve
out
an
honest
future
under
a
new
name
and
among
new
associates
you
equal
to
it
mershone
shook
his
head
you
forget
he
said
they
give
me
a
jail
sentence
for
this
folly
as
sure
as
fate
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
me
not
necessarily
see
here
mershone
it
wo
help
any
of
those
people
to
prosecute
you
if
the
girl
escapes
with
her
life
no
real
harm
has
been
done
although
you
caused
a
deal
of
unhappiness
in
one
way
or
another
for
my
part
i
like
to
see
you
escape
because
i
sure
this
affair
will
be
a
warning
to
you
that
will
induce
you
to
give
up
all
trickery
in
the
future
money
would
bribe
me
as
you
know
but
sympathy
and
good
fellowship
will
if
you
promise
to
skip
right
now
and
turn
over
a
new
leaf
you
are
free
where
could
i
go
there
a
town
a
mile
ahead
of
us
i
can
see
the
buildings
now
and
then
you
money
for
you
offered
it
to
me
i
have
any
assistants
here
i
all
alone
on
the
job
that
talk
about
four
men
was
only
a
bluff
push
me
over
in
the
snow
and
make
tracks
i
tell
weldon
escaped
and
advise
him
not
to
bother
you
it
very
easy
mershone
stopped
short
seized
the
detective
hand
and
wrung
it
gratefully
you
a
good
fellow
fogerty
i
i
thank
you
but
i
ca
do
it
in
the
first
place
i
ca
rest
in
peace
until
louise
is
found
or
i
know
her
fate
secondly
i
game
to
give
an
account
for
all
my
deeds
now
that
i
played
the
farce
out
and
lost
i
i
really
have
the
ambition
fogerty
to
make
a
new
start
in
life
and
try
to
reform
what
the
use
fogerty
did
not
reply
perhaps
he
realized
the
case
was
entirely
hopeless
but
he
had
done
what
he
could
to
save
the
misguided
fellow
and
give
him
a
chance
and
he
was
sorry
he
had
not
succeeded
meantime
arthur
weldon
almost
dazed
by
the
calamity
that
had
overtaken
his
sweetheart
found
an
able
assistant
in
his
chauffeur
who
when
the
case
was
explained
to
him
developed
an
eager
and
intelligent
interest
in
the
chase
fortunately
they
moved
with
the
storm
and
the
snow
presently
moderated
in
volume
although
the
wind
was
still
blowing
a
fierce
gale
this
gave
them
a
better
opportunity
than
the
others
to
observe
the
road
they
followed
jones
had
good
eyes
and
although
the
trail
of
the
heavy
wagon
was
lost
at
times
he
soon
picked
it
up
again
and
they
were
enabled
to
make
fairly
good
speed
i
believe
said
arthur
presently
that
the
marks
are
getting
clearer
i
know
they
are
sir
agreed
jones
then
we
come
in
the
right
direction
for
it
is
proof
that
the
wagon
was
headed
this
way
quite
right
sir
this
back
section
was
thinly
settled
and
the
occasional
they
passed
were
set
well
back
from
the
road
it
was
evident
from
the
closed
gates
and
drifted
snowbanks
that
no
teams
had
either
left
these
places
or
arrived
during
a
recent
period
arthur
was
encouraged
moreover
by
the
wagon
ruts
growing
still
more
clear
as
they
proceeded
and
his
excitement
was
great
when
jones
abruptly
halted
and
pointed
to
a
place
where
the
wheels
had
made
a
turn
and
entered
a
farm
yard
here
the
place
sir
announced
the
chauffeur
can
you
get
in
it
pretty
deep
sir
but
i
try
the
snow
was
crisp
and
light
owing
to
the
excessive
cold
and
the
machine
plowed
through
it
bravely
drawing
up
at
last
to
the
door
of
an
humble
cottage
as
arthur
leaped
out
of
the
car
a
man
appeared
upon
the
steps
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
looking
for
the
young
lady
sir
he
asked
is
she
here
cried
arthur
the
man
placed
his
finger
on
his
lips
although
the
wind
prevented
any
sound
of
voices
being
heard
within
gently
sir
do
make
a
noise
but
come
in
they
entered
what
seemed
to
be
a
kitchen
the
farmer
a
man
of
advanced
years
led
him
to
a
front
room
and
again
cautioning
him
to
be
silent
motioned
him
to
enter
a
stove
made
the
place
fairly
comfortable
by
a
window
sat
a
woman
bent
over
some
sewing
on
a
couch
opposite
lay
louise
covered
by
a
heavy
shawl
she
was
fast
asleep
her
hair
disheveled
and
straying
over
her
crimson
cheeks
flushed
from
exposure
to
the
weather
her
slumber
seemed
the
result
of
physical
exhaustion
for
her
lips
were
parted
and
she
breathed
deeply
arthur
after
gazing
at
her
for
a
moment
with
a
for
the
mysterious
actions
of
the
old
farmer
had
made
him
fear
the
worst
softly
approached
the
couch
and
knelt
beside
the
girl
he
loved
thanking
god
in
his
inmost
heart
for
her
escape
then
he
leaned
over
and
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her
cheek
louise
slowly
opened
her
eyes
smiled
divinely
and
threw
her
arms
impulsively
around
his
neck
i
knew
you
would
come
for
me
dear
she
whispered
chapter
xxiv
a
matter
of
course
all
explanations
were
barred
until
the
girl
had
been
tenderly
taken
to
her
own
home
and
under
the
loving
care
of
her
mother
and
cousins
had
recovered
to
an
extent
from
the
terrible
experiences
she
had
undergone
then
by
degrees
she
told
them
her
story
and
how
hearing
the
voice
of
her
persecutor
mershone
in
the
hall
below
she
had
become
frantic
with
fear
and
resolved
to
trust
herself
to
the
mercies
of
the
storm
rather
than
submit
to
an
interview
with
him
before
this
she
had
decided
that
she
could
climb
down
the
trellis
and
that
part
of
her
flight
she
accomplished
easily
then
she
ran
toward
the
rear
of
the
premises
to
avoid
being
seen
and
managed
to
find
the
lane
and
later
the
it
was
very
cold
but
her
excitement
and
the
fear
of
pursuit
kept
her
warm
until
suddenly
her
strength
failed
her
and
she
sank
down
in
the
snow
without
power
to
move
at
this
juncture
the
farmer
and
his
wife
drove
by
having
been
on
a
trip
to
the
town
the
man
sprang
out
and
lifted
her
in
and
the
woman
tenderly
wrapped
her
in
the
robes
and
blankets
and
pillowed
her
head
upon
her
motherly
bosom
by
the
time
they
reached
the
she
was
quite
warm
again
but
so
exhausted
that
with
a
brief
explanation
that
she
was
lost
but
somebody
would
be
sure
to
find
her
before
long
she
fell
upon
the
couch
and
almost
immediately
lost
consciousness
so
arthur
found
her
and
one
look
into
his
eyes
assured
her
that
all
her
troubles
were
over
they
did
not
prosecute
charlie
mershone
after
all
fogerty
pleaded
for
him
earnestly
and
uncle
john
pointed
out
that
to
arrest
the
young
man
would
mean
to
give
the
whole
affair
to
the
newspapers
which
until
now
had
not
gleaned
the
slightest
inkling
of
what
had
happened
publicity
was
to
be
avoided
if
possible
as
it
would
set
loose
a
thousand
malicious
tongues
and
benefit
nobody
the
only
thing
to
be
gained
by
prosecuting
mershone
was
revenge
and
all
were
willing
to
forego
that
doubtful
satisfaction
however
uncle
john
had
an
interview
with
the
young
man
in
the
office
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
at
which
mershone
was
given
permission
to
leave
town
quietly
and
pursue
his
fortunes
in
other
fields
if
ever
he
returned
or
in
any
way
molested
any
of
the
merricks
or
his
cousin
diana
he
was
assured
that
he
would
be
immediately
arrested
and
prosecuted
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law
mershone
accepted
the
conditions
and
became
an
exile
passing
at
once
out
of
the
lives
of
those
he
had
so
deeply
wronged
the
joyful
reunion
of
the
lovers
led
to
an
early
date
being
set
for
the
wedding
they
met
all
protests
by
pleading
their
fears
of
another
heartrending
separation
and
no
one
ventured
to
oppose
their
desire
merrick
quickly
recovered
her
accustomed
spirits
during
the
excitement
of
those
anxious
weeks
preceding
the
wedding
cards
were
issued
to
the
very
best
people
in
town
the
involved
anxiety
by
day
and
restless
dreams
by
night
all
eminently
enjoyable
there
were
entertainments
to
be
attended
and
congratulations
to
be
received
from
every
side
society
suspecting
nothing
of
the
tragedy
so
lately
enacted
in
these
young
lives
was
especially
gracious
to
the
betrothed
louise
was
the
recipient
of
innumerable
merry
showers
from
her
girl
associates
and
her
cousins
patsy
and
beth
followed
in
line
with
glass
showers
and
china
showers
until
the
prospective
bride
was
stocked
with
enough
wares
to
establish
a
emporium
as
uncle
john
proudly
declared
merrick
by
this
time
quite
reconciled
and
palpably
pleased
at
the
approaching
marriage
of
his
eldest
niece
was
not
to
be
outdone
in
social
stunts
that
might
add
to
her
happiness
he
gave
theatre
parties
and
banquets
without
number
and
gave
them
with
the
marked
success
that
invariably
attended
his
efforts
the
evening
before
the
wedding
uncle
john
and
the
major
claimed
arthur
for
their
own
and
after
an
hour
conference
between
the
three
that
left
the
young
fellow
more
happy
and
grateful
than
ever
before
he
was
entertained
at
his
last
bachelor
dinner
where
he
made
a
remarkable
speech
and
was
lustily
cheered
of
course
beth
and
patsy
were
the
bridesmaids
and
their
cousin
kenneth
forbes
came
all
the
way
from
elmhurst
to
be
arthur
best
man
no
one
ever
knew
what
it
cost
uncle
john
for
the
wonderful
decorations
at
the
church
and
home
for
the
music
the
banquet
and
all
the
other
details
which
he
himself
eagerly
arranged
on
a
magnificent
scale
and
claimed
was
a
part
of
his
wedding
present
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
young
people
had
driven
away
to
begin
the
journey
of
life
together
the
little
man
put
a
loving
arm
around
beth
and
patsy
and
said
between
smiles
and
tears
well
my
dears
i
lost
one
niece
and
that
a
fact
but
i
still
two
left
how
long
will
they
remain
with
me
i
wonder
dear
me
uncle
john
said
practical
patsy
your
necktie
untied
and
dangling
like
a
shoestring
i
hope
it
was
that
way
at
the
wedding
it
was
though
declared
the
major
chuckling
if
all
three
of
ye
get
married
my
dears
poor
uncle
john
will
come
to
look
like
a
scarecrow
and
all
that
in
the
face
of
swell
society
are
we
about
through
with
swell
society
now
asked
merrick
anxiously
are
we
about
done
with
it
it
caused
all
our
troubles
you
know
society
announced
beth
complacently
is
an
excellent
thing
in
the
abstract
it
has
its
black
sheep
of
course
but
i
think
no
more
than
any
other
established
class
of
humanity
dear
me
cried
uncle
john
you
once
denounced
society
that
said
she
was
before
i
knew
anything
at
all
about
it
