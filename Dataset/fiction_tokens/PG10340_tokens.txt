chapter
i
the
kinzer
farm
the
new
suit
and
the
wedding
between
the
village
and
the
inlet
and
half
a
mile
from
the
great
bay
lay
the
kinzer
farm
beyond
the
bay
was
a
sandbar
and
beyond
that
the
atlantic
ocean
for
all
this
was
on
the
southerly
shore
of
long
island
the
kinzer
farm
had
lain
right
there
acre
for
acre
no
more
no
less
on
the
day
when
hendrik
hudson
long
ago
sailed
the
good
ship
half
moon
into
bay
but
it
was
not
then
known
to
any
one
as
the
kinzer
farm
neither
was
there
then
as
now
any
bright
and
growing
village
crowding
up
on
one
side
of
it
with
a
and
a
nor
was
there
at
that
time
any
great
and
busy
city
of
new
york
only
a
few
hours
ride
away
over
on
the
island
of
manhattan
the
kinzers
themselves
were
not
there
then
but
the
bay
and
the
inlet
with
the
fish
and
the
crabs
and
the
ebbing
and
flowing
tides
were
there
very
much
the
same
before
hendrik
hudson
and
his
brave
dutchmen
knew
any
thing
whatever
about
that
corner
of
the
world
the
kinzer
farm
had
always
been
a
reasonably
fat
one
both
as
to
size
and
quality
and
the
good
people
who
lived
on
it
had
generally
been
of
a
somewhat
similar
description
it
was
therefore
every
way
correct
and
becoming
for
dabney
kinzer
widowed
mother
and
his
sisters
to
be
the
plump
and
hearty
beings
they
were
and
all
the
more
discouraging
to
poor
dabney
that
no
amount
of
regular
and
faithful
eating
seemed
to
make
him
resemble
them
at
all
in
that
respect
kinzer
excused
his
thinness
to
her
neighbors
to
be
sure
on
the
ground
that
he
was
such
a
growing
boy
but
for
all
that
he
caught
himself
wondering
now
and
then
if
he
would
never
be
done
with
that
part
of
his
trials
for
rapid
growth
has
its
trials
the
fact
is
he
said
to
himself
one
day
as
he
leaned
over
the
north
fence
i
more
like
ham
morris
farm
than
i
am
like
ours
his
farm
is
bigger
than
ours
all
round
but
it
too
big
for
its
fences
just
as
i
too
big
for
my
clothes
ham
house
is
three
times
as
large
as
ours
but
it
looks
as
if
it
had
grown
too
fast
it
has
any
paint
to
speak
of
nor
any
blinds
it
looks
as
if
somebody
just
built
it
there
and
then
forgot
it
and
gone
oft
and
left
it
out
of
doors
dabney
four
sisters
had
all
come
into
the
world
before
him
but
he
was
as
tall
as
any
of
them
and
was
frequently
taken
by
strangers
for
a
good
two
years
older
than
he
was
it
was
sometimes
very
hard
for
him
a
boy
of
fifteen
to
live
up
to
what
was
expected
of
those
extra
two
years
kinzer
still
kept
him
in
roundabouts
but
they
did
not
seem
to
hinder
his
growth
at
all
if
that
was
her
object
in
so
doing
there
was
no
such
thing
however
as
keeping
the
four
girls
in
roundabouts
of
any
kind
and
what
between
them
and
their
mother
the
pleasant
and
tidy
little
kinzer
homestead
with
its
snug
parlor
and
its
cosey
bits
of
rooms
and
chambers
seemed
to
nestle
away
under
the
shadowy
elms
and
sycamores
smaller
and
smaller
with
every
year
that
came
it
was
a
terribly
tight
fit
for
such
a
family
anyway
and
now
that
dabney
was
growing
at
such
a
rate
there
was
no
telling
what
they
would
all
come
to
but
kinzer
came
at
last
to
the
rescue
and
she
summoned
her
eldest
daughter
miranda
to
her
aid
a
very
notable
woman
was
the
widow
when
the
new
railway
cut
off
part
of
the
old
farm
she
had
split
up
the
slice
of
land
between
the
iron
track
and
the
village
into
town
lots
and
had
sold
them
all
off
by
the
time
the
railway
company
paid
her
for
the
damage
it
had
done
the
property
the
whole
kinzer
family
gained
visibly
in
plumpness
that
year
except
perhaps
dabney
of
course
the
condition
and
requirements
of
ham
morris
and
his
big
farm
just
over
the
north
fence
had
not
escaped
such
a
pair
of
eyes
as
those
of
the
widow
and
the
very
size
of
his
great
barn
of
a
house
finally
settled
his
fate
for
him
a
large
quiet
unambitious
but
and
industrious
young
man
was
hamilton
morris
and
he
had
not
the
least
idea
of
the
good
in
store
for
him
for
several
months
after
kinzer
decided
to
marry
him
to
her
daughter
miranda
but
all
was
soon
settled
dab
of
course
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
wedding
arrangements
and
ham
share
was
somewhat
contracted
not
but
what
he
was
at
the
kinzer
house
a
good
deal
nor
did
any
of
the
other
girls
tell
miranda
how
very
much
he
was
in
the
way
he
could
talk
however
and
one
morning
about
a
fortnight
before
the
day
appointed
he
said
to
miranda
and
her
mother
we
ca
have
so
very
much
of
a
wedding
your
house
is
so
small
and
you
chocked
it
so
full
of
furniture
right
down
nice
furniture
it
is
too
but
there
so
much
of
it
i
afraid
the
minister
have
to
stand
out
in
the
front
yard
the
house
do
for
this
time
replied
kinzer
there
be
room
enough
for
everybody
what
puzzles
me
is
dab
what
about
dab
asked
ham
ca
find
a
thing
to
fit
him
said
dab
mother
seems
as
if
he
were
all
odd
sizes
from
head
to
foot
fit
him
exclaimed
ham
oh
you
mean
goods
of
course
you
ca
he
have
to
be
measured
by
a
tailor
and
have
his
new
suit
built
for
him
such
extravagance
emphatically
remarked
kinzer
not
for
rich
people
like
you
and
for
a
wedding
replied
ham
and
dab
a
growing
boy
where
is
he
now
i
going
to
the
village
and
take
him
right
along
with
me
there
seemed
to
be
no
help
for
it
but
that
was
the
first
point
relating
to
the
wedding
concerning
which
ham
morris
was
permitted
to
have
exactly
his
own
way
his
success
made
dab
kinzer
a
fast
friend
of
his
for
life
and
that
was
something
there
was
also
something
new
and
wonderful
to
dabney
himself
in
walking
into
a
tailor
shop
picking
out
cloth
to
please
himself
and
being
so
carefully
measured
all
over
he
stretched
and
stretched
himself
in
all
directions
to
make
sure
nothing
should
turn
out
too
small
at
the
end
of
it
all
ham
said
to
him
now
dab
my
boy
this
suit
is
to
be
a
present
from
me
to
you
on
miranda
account
dab
colored
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
it
seemed
all
right
he
thought
and
so
he
came
frankly
out
with
thank
you
ham
you
always
was
a
prime
good
fellow
i
do
as
much
for
you
some
day
tell
you
what
i
do
then
i
have
another
suit
made
right
away
of
this
other
cloth
and
have
the
bill
for
that
one
sent
to
our
folks
do
it
exclaimed
ham
do
it
you
your
mother
orders
for
that
she
nothing
to
do
with
my
gift
splendid
almost
shouted
dab
oh
but
do
i
hope
they
fit
vit
said
the
tailor
vill
zay
vit
i
dell
you
zay
vit
you
like
a
knife
you
vait
und
zee
dab
failed
to
get
a
very
clear
idea
of
what
the
fit
would
be
but
it
made
him
almost
hold
his
breath
to
think
of
it
after
the
triumphant
visit
to
the
tailor
there
was
still
a
necessity
for
a
call
upon
the
shoemaker
and
that
was
a
matter
of
no
small
importance
dab
feet
had
always
been
a
mystery
and
a
trial
to
him
if
his
memory
contained
one
record
darker
than
another
it
was
the
endless
history
of
his
misadventures
with
boots
and
shoes
he
and
leather
had
been
at
war
from
the
day
he
left
his
until
now
but
now
he
was
promised
a
pair
of
shoes
that
would
be
sure
to
fit
so
the
question
of
dab
personal
appearance
at
the
wedding
was
all
arranged
between
him
and
ham
and
miranda
smiled
more
sweetly
than
ever
before
upon
the
latter
after
she
had
heard
her
usually
silent
brother
break
out
so
enthusiastically
about
him
as
he
did
that
evening
it
was
a
good
thing
for
that
wedding
that
it
took
place
in
fine
summer
weather
for
neither
kith
kin
nor
acquaintances
had
been
slighted
in
the
invitations
and
the
kinzers
were
one
of
the
oldest
families
to
have
gathered
them
all
under
the
roof
of
that
house
without
either
stretching
it
out
wider
or
boiling
the
guests
down
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
and
so
the
majority
with
dabney
in
his
new
clothes
to
keep
them
countenance
stood
out
in
the
cool
shade
of
the
grand
old
trees
during
the
ceremony
which
was
performed
near
the
open
door
and
were
afterwards
served
with
the
refreshments
in
a
style
which
spoke
volumes
for
kinzer
good
management
as
well
as
for
her
hospitality
the
only
drawback
to
dab
happiness
that
day
was
that
his
acquaintances
hardly
seemed
to
know
him
he
had
had
almost
the
same
trouble
with
himself
when
he
looked
in
the
glass
that
morning
ordinarily
his
wrists
were
several
inches
through
his
and
his
ankles
made
a
perpetual
show
of
his
stockings
his
neck
too
seemed
to
be
holding
his
head
as
far
as
possible
from
his
and
his
buttons
had
no
favors
to
ask
of
his
now
even
as
the
tailor
had
promised
he
had
received
his
first
fit
he
seemed
to
himself
to
tell
the
truth
to
be
covered
up
in
a
prodigal
waste
of
new
cloth
would
he
ever
ever
grow
too
big
for
such
a
suit
of
clothes
as
that
it
was
a
very
painful
thought
and
he
did
his
best
to
put
it
away
from
him
still
it
was
a
little
hard
to
have
a
young
lady
whom
he
had
known
since
before
she
began
to
walk
remark
to
him
excuse
me
sir
but
can
you
tell
me
if
dabney
kinzer
is
here
no
jenny
walters
sharply
responded
dab
he
is
here
why
dabney
exclaimed
the
pretty
jenny
is
that
you
i
declare
you
have
scared
me
out
of
a
year
growth
i
wish
you
scare
me
then
said
dab
then
my
clothes
would
stay
fitted
every
thing
had
been
so
well
arranged
beforehand
thanks
to
kinzer
that
the
wedding
had
no
chance
at
all
except
to
go
off
well
ham
morris
was
rejoiced
to
find
how
entirely
he
was
relieved
of
every
responsibility
do
worry
about
your
house
the
widow
said
to
him
the
night
before
the
wedding
we
go
over
there
as
soon
as
you
and
miranda
get
away
and
it
be
all
ready
for
you
by
the
time
you
get
back
all
right
said
ham
i
be
glad
to
have
you
take
the
old
place
in
hand
i
only
tried
to
live
in
a
corner
of
it
you
do
know
how
much
room
there
is
i
do
i
must
say
dabney
had
longed
to
ask
her
if
she
meant
to
have
it
moved
over
to
the
kinzer
side
of
the
north
fence
but
he
had
doubts
as
to
the
propriety
of
it
and
just
then
the
boy
came
in
from
the
tailor
with
his
bundle
of
new
clothes
chapter
ii
dab
old
clothes
get
a
new
boy
to
fit
hamilton
morris
was
a
very
promising
young
man
of
some
thirty
summers
he
had
been
an
orphan
for
a
dozen
years
and
the
wonder
was
that
he
should
so
long
have
lived
alone
in
the
big
house
his
father
left
him
at
all
events
miranda
kinzer
was
just
the
wife
for
him
miranda
mother
had
seen
that
at
a
glance
the
moment
her
mind
was
settled
about
the
house
as
to
that
and
his
great
spreading
farm
all
either
of
them
needed
was
ready
money
and
management
these
were
blessings
ham
was
now
made
reasonably
sure
of
on
his
return
from
his
and
he
was
likely
to
appreciate
them
as
for
dabney
kinzer
he
was
in
no
respect
overcome
by
the
novelty
and
excitement
of
the
all
the
rest
of
it
after
the
departure
of
ham
morris
and
the
bride
he
devoted
himself
to
such
duties
as
were
assigned
him
with
a
new
and
grand
idea
steadily
taking
shape
in
his
mind
he
felt
as
if
his
brains
too
like
his
body
were
growing
some
of
his
mother
older
and
more
intimate
friends
remained
with
her
all
day
probably
to
comfort
her
for
the
loss
of
miranda
and
two
or
three
of
them
dab
knew
would
stay
to
tea
so
that
his
services
would
be
in
demand
to
see
them
safely
home
all
day
long
moreover
samantha
and
keziah
and
pamela
seemed
to
find
themselves
wonderfully
busy
one
way
and
another
so
that
they
paid
even
less
attention
than
usual
to
any
of
the
ins
and
outs
of
their
brother
dabney
was
therefore
able
with
little
difficulty
to
take
for
himself
whatever
of
odd
time
he
might
require
for
putting
his
new
idea
into
execution
kinzer
herself
noticed
the
rare
good
sense
with
which
her
son
hurried
through
with
his
dinner
and
slipped
away
leaving
her
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
table
and
her
lady
guests
and
neither
she
nor
either
of
the
girls
had
a
thought
of
following
him
if
they
had
done
so
they
might
have
seen
him
draw
a
bundle
out
from
under
the
in
the
back
yard
and
hurry
down
through
the
garden
a
few
moments
more
and
dabney
had
appeared
on
the
fence
of
the
old
leading
down
to
the
shore
there
he
sat
eying
one
after
another
till
he
suddenly
sprang
from
his
perch
exclaiming
that
just
the
chap
why
they
fit
him
and
that
more
they
ever
did
for
me
dab
would
probably
have
had
to
search
along
the
coast
for
miles
before
he
could
have
found
a
human
being
better
suited
to
his
present
charitable
purposes
than
the
boy
who
now
came
so
lazily
down
the
road
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
color
or
that
he
was
all
over
of
about
the
same
shade
of
black
his
old
tow
trowsers
and
calico
shirt
revealed
the
shining
fact
in
too
many
places
to
leave
room
for
a
question
and
shoes
he
had
none
dick
said
dabney
was
you
ever
married
married
exclaimed
dick
with
a
peal
of
very
musical
laughter
is
i
married
no
is
you
no
replied
dabney
but
i
was
very
near
it
this
morning
dat
so
asked
dick
with
another
show
of
his
white
teeth

if

only
dressed

dab
just

these
golly
exclaimed
the
black
boy
but
he
seized
the
bundle
dab
threw
him
and
he
had
it
open
in
a
twinkling
any
in
de
pockets
he
asked
guess
not
said
dab
but
there
lots
of
room
say
dar
was
exclaimed
dick
but
wo
dese
be
warm
it
was
quite
likely
for
the
day
was
not
a
cool
one
and
dick
never
seemed
to
think
of
getting
off
what
he
had
on
before
getting
into
his
unexpected
present
coat
vest
and
trousers
they
were
all
pulled
on
with
more
quickness
than
dab
had
ever
seen
the
young
african
display
before
i
much
obleeged
to
ye
kinzer
said
dick
very
proudly
as
he
strutted
across
the
road
i
das
go
back
fru
de
village
what
you
do
then
asked
dab
i
better
go
said
dick
will
de
fish
bite
oh
the
clothes
wo
make
any
odds
to
them
said
dabney
i
must
go
back
to
the
house
and
so
he
did
while
dick
on
whom
the
garments
of
his
white
friend
were
really
a
pretty
good
fit
marched
on
down
the
road
feeling
grander
than
he
ever
had
before
in
all
his
life
that
be
a
good
thing
to
tell
ham
morris
when
he
and
miranda
get
home
again
muttered
dab
as
he
the
house
late
that
evening
when
dabney
returned
from
his
final
duties
as
escort
to
his
mother
guests
she
rewarded
him
with
more
than
he
could
remember
ever
receiving
of
motherly
commendation
i
been
really
quite
proud
of
you
dabney
she
said
as
she
laid
her
plump
hand
on
the
collar
of
his
new
coat
and
kissed
him
behaved
like
a
perfect
little
gentleman
only
mother
exclaimed
keziah
he
spent
too
much
of
his
time
with
that
little
jenny
walters
never
mind
kezi
said
dab
she
did
know
who
i
was
till
i
told
her
i
going
to
wear
a
label
with
my
name
on
it
when
i
go
over
to
the
village
and
then
you
put
on
your
other
suit
in
the
morning
said
kinzer
you
must
keep
this
for
sundays
and
great
occasions
any
more
weddings
coming
right
away
said
dab
with
a
sharp
glance
around
upon
what
remained
of
the
family
but
the
girls
were
all
very
busy
just
then
with
their
books
and
their
sewing
and
he
did
not
get
any
direct
reply
even
his
mother
walked
away
after
something
she
had
left
in
the
when
the
next
morning
came
dabney
kinzer
was
a
more
than
usually
early
riser
for
he
felt
that
he
had
waked
up
to
a
very
important
day
dabney
exclaimed
his
mother
when
he
came
in
to
breakfast
did
i
not
tell
you
to
put
on
your
other
suit
so
i
have
mother
replied
dab
this
is
my
other
suit
that
exclaimed
kinzer
so
it
is
cried
keziah
so
it
is
added
samantha
mother
that
is
not
what
he
had
on
yesterday
he
been
trading
again
mildly
suggested
pamela
dabney
said
kinzer
what
does
this
mean
mean
replied
dabney
why
these
are
the
clothes
you
told
me
to
buy
the
lot
i
wore
yesterday
were
a
present
from
ham
morris
he
a
splendid
fellow
i
glad
he
got
the
best
of
the
girls
that
was
a
bad
thing
for
dabney
to
say
just
then
for
it
was
vigorously
resented
by
the
remaining
three
as
soon
as
quiet
was
restored
however
kinzer
remarked
i
think
hamilton
should
have
consulted
me
about
it
but
it
too
late
now
anyhow
you
may
go
and
put
on
your
other
clothes
my
wedding
suit
asked
dab
no
indeed
i
mean
your
old
ones
those
you
took
off
night
before
last
dunno
where
they
are
slowly
responded
dab
do
know
where
they
are
responded
a
chorus
of
four
voices
no
said
dab
bill
lee
black
boy
had
em
on
all
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
reckon
he
gone
again
they
fit
him
a
good
sight
better
they
ever
did
me
if
dabney
had
expected
a
storm
to
come
from
his
mother
end
of
the
table
he
was
pleasantly
mistaken
and
his
sisters
had
it
all
to
themselves
for
a
moment
then
with
an
admiring
glance
at
her
son
the
thoughtful
matron
remarked
just
like
his
father
for
all
the
world
it
no
use
girls
dabney
a
growing
boy
in
more
ways
than
one
dabney
i
shall
want
you
to
go
over
to
the
morris
house
with
me
after
breakfast
then
you
may
hitch
up
the
ponies
and
we
do
some
errands
around
the
village
dab
kinzer
sisters
looked
at
one
another
in
blank
astonishment
and
samantha
would
have
left
the
table
if
she
had
only
finished
her
breakfast
pamela
as
being
nearest
to
dab
in
age
and
sympathy
gave
a
very
admiring
look
at
her
brother
second
good
fit
and
said
nothing
even
keziah
finally
admitted
in
her
own
mind
that
such
a
change
in
dabney
appearance
might
have
its
advantages
but
samantha
inwardly
declared
war
the
young
hero
himself
was
hardly
used
to
that
second
suit
as
yet
and
felt
any
thing
but
easy
in
it
i
wonder
he
said
to
himself
what
jenny
walters
would
say
to
me
now
wonder
if
she
know
me
not
a
doubt
of
it
but
after
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
and
gone
out
his
mother
remarked
it
really
all
right
girls
i
almost
fear
i
have
been
neglecting
dabney
he
is
a
little
boy
any
more
he
is
a
man
yet
exclaimed
samantha
and
he
talks
slang
dreadfully
but
then
he
does
grow
so
remarked
keziah
mother
said
pamela
could
you
get
dab
to
give
dick
lee
the
slang
along
with
the
old
clothes
we
see
about
it
replied
kinzer
it
was
very
clear
that
dabney
mother
had
begun
to
take
in
a
new
idea
about
her
son
it
was
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
unpleasant
to
find
out
that
he
was
growing
in
more
ways
than
one
and
it
was
quite
likely
that
she
had
indeed
kept
him
too
long
in
roundabouts
at
all
events
his
great
idea
had
been
worked
out
into
a
triumphant
success
and
before
the
evening
was
over
pamela
replied
to
a
remark
of
samantha
i
do
care
he
taller
than
i
am
and
i
ever
so
much
rather
have
a
walk
beside
me
to
meeting
chapter
iii
a
member
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
meets
a
young
gentleman
from
the
city
dick
lee
had
been
more
than
half
right
about
the
village
being
a
dangerous
place
for
him
with
such
an
unusual
amount
of
clothing
over
his
ordinary
uniform
the
very
dogs
every
one
of
whom
was
an
old
acquaintance
barked
at
him
on
his
way
home
that
night
and
proud
as
were
his
ebony
father
and
mother
of
the
improvement
in
their
son
appearance
they
yielded
to
his
earnest
entreaties
first
that
he
might
wear
his
present
all
the
next
day
and
second
that
he
might
betake
himself
to
the
bay
early
in
the
morning
and
so
keep
out
of
sight
till
he
got
used
to
it
you
jist
mind
wot
yer
about
said
his
mother
and
you
keep
dem
from
gettin
wet
i
jist
ca
to
hab
dem
spiled
right
away
the
fault
with
dab
kinzer
old
suit
after
all
had
lain
mainly
in
its
size
rather
than
its
materials
for
kinzer
was
too
good
a
manager
to
be
really
stingy
dick
succeeded
in
reaching
the
without
falling
in
with
any
one
who
seemed
disposed
to
laugh
at
him
but
there
right
on
the
wharf
was
a
white
boy
of
about
his
own
age
and
he
felt
a
good
deal
like
backing
out
nebber
seen
him
afore
either
said
dick
to
himself
den
i
guess
i
ai
afeard
ob
him
the
stranger
was
a
somewhat
short
and
but
bright
and
boy
with
a
pair
of
very
keen
eyes
but
after
all
the
first
word
he
spoke
to
poor
dick
was
hullo
clothes
where
are
you
going
with
all
that
boy
i
knowed
it
i
knowed
it
groaned
dick
but
he
answered
as
sharply
as
he
knew
how
i
goin
any
ob
youah
business
where
you
learn
how
to
fish
the
stranger
asked
down
south
know
they
had
any
there
nebbah
was
down
souf
was
the
somewhat
surly
reply
father
run
away
did
he
he
nebber
was
down
dar
nudder
nor
his
father
no
business
ob
yourn
said
dick
but
we
allers
lived
right
heah
on
dis
bay
guess
not
said
the
white
boy
knowingly
dick
was
right
nevertheless
for
his
people
had
been
slaves
among
the
very
earliest
dutch
settlers
and
had
never
lived
south
at
all
he
was
now
busily
getting
one
of
the
boats
ready
to
shove
off
but
his
white
tormentor
went
at
him
again
with
well
then
if
you
lived
round
here
as
long
as
that
you
must
know
everybody
reckon
i
do
are
there
any
nice
fellows
around
here
any
like
me
de
nicest
young
round
dis
bay
replied
dick
is
dab
kinzer
but
he
ai
like
you
not
nuff
to
hurt
him
dab
kinzer
exclaimed
the
stranger
where
he
get
his
name
in
de
bay
i
said
dick
as
he
shoved
his
boat
off
caught
wid
a
hook
anyhow
said
the
strange
boy
to
himself
that
probably
the
kind
of
fellow
my
father
would
wish
me
to
associate
with
only
it
likely
very
ignorant
and
he
walked
away
towards
the
village
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
forgotten
more
than
the
rest
of
his
race
were
ever
likely
to
find
out
at
all
events
dick
lee
had
managed
to
say
a
good
word
for
his
benefactor
little
as
he
could
guess
what
might
be
the
consequences
meantime
dab
kinzer
when
he
went
out
from
breakfast
had
strolled
away
to
the
north
fence
for
a
good
look
at
the
house
which
was
thenceforth
to
be
the
home
of
his
favorite
sister
he
had
seen
it
before
every
day
since
he
could
remember
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
fresh
and
almost
mournful
interest
for
him
just
now
hullo
he
exclaimed
as
he
leaned
against
the
fence
putting
up
ladders
oh
yes
i
see
that
old
tommy
mcgrew
the
well
ham
house
needs
a
new
coat
as
badly
as
i
did
sure
it
fit
too
only
it
ai
used
to
it
any
more
i
am
dabney
it
was
his
mother
voice
and
dab
felt
like
minding
very
promptly
that
morning
dabney
my
boy
come
here
to
the
gate
ham
morris
is
having
his
house
painted
he
remarked
as
he
walked
towards
his
mother
is
he
she
said
we
go
and
see
about
it
the
gate
between
the
two
had
been
there
from
time
immemorial
walked
right
through
as
they
drew
nearer
the
morris
house
however
dabney
discovered
that
carpenters
as
well
as
painters
were
plying
their
trade
in
and
about
the
old
homestead
there
were
piled
here
and
blinds
there
a
new
door
or
so
ready
for
use
a
great
stack
of
bundles
of
shingles
some
barrels
of
lime
and
a
heap
of
sand
whichever
way
dab
looked
there
were
visible
signs
of
an
approaching
renovation
going
to
fix
it
all
over
he
remarked
yes
replied
his
mother
it
be
as
good
as
new
it
was
well
built
and
will
bear
mending
i
could
say
that
of
some
of
the
shackling
things
they
been
putting
up
around
the
village
when
they
entered
the
house
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
the
shabby
days
of
the
morris
mansion
were
numbered
there
were
men
at
work
in
almost
every
room
ham
would
surely
give
plenty
of
time
at
that
rate
for
an
immense
amount
of
mending
and
his
house
would
be
as
the
widow
had
promised
all
ready
for
him
on
his
return
there
was
nothing
wonderful
to
dabney
in
the
idea
of
his
mother
going
about
and
inspecting
work
and
finding
fault
and
giving
directions
he
had
never
seen
her
do
any
thing
else
and
he
had
the
greatest
confidence
in
her
knowledge
and
ability
he
noticed
too
before
they
left
the
place
that
the
customary
was
going
ahead
with
even
more
regularity
and
energy
than
if
the
owner
himself
had
been
present
ham
farm
look
something
like
ours
one
of
these
days
he
said
if
things
go
on
at
this
rate
i
mean
it
shall
replied
his
mother
a
little
sharply
now
go
and
get
out
the
ponies
and
we
do
the
rest
of
our
errands
dab
started
for
the
barn
at
a
half
trot
for
if
there
was
one
thing
he
liked
better
than
another
it
was
to
have
the
reins
in
his
hands
and
that
pair
of
ponies
before
him
time
had
been
when
kinzer
did
her
own
driving
and
only
permitted
dab
to
hold
the
horses
while
she
made
her
calls
business
or
otherwise
but
that
day
had
been
safely
put
away
among
dab
unpleasant
memories
for
a
good
while
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
before
the
neat
buggy
held
the
widow
and
her
son
and
the
ponies
were
taking
them
briskly
down
the
road
towards
the
village
it
they
had
only
known
it
at
that
very
moment
ham
morris
and
his
blooming
bride
were
setting
out
for
a
drive
at
the
fashionable
where
they
had
made
their
first
stop
in
their
ham
said
miranda
it
seems
to
me
as
if
we
were
a
thousand
miles
from
home
we
shall
be
a
good
deal
farther
before
we
get
any
nearer
said
ham
but
i
wonder
what
they
are
doing
there
this
morning
mother
and
the
girls
and
dear
little
dabney
little
dabney
exclaimed
ham
with
a
queer
sort
of
laugh
on
his
face
why
miranda
do
you
think
dab
is
a
baby
yet
no
not
a
baby
but
well
he
a
boy
that
a
fact
but
he
be
as
tall
as
i
am
in
three
years
will
he
do
you
think
so
but
will
he
ever
get
fat
not
till
after
he
gets
his
full
length
said
ham
we
must
have
him
at
our
house
a
good
deal
after
we
get
home
and
feed
him
up
i
taken
a
liking
to
dab
feed
him
up
said
miranda
do
you
think
we
starve
him
no
i
suppose
not
but
how
many
meals
a
day
does
he
get
three
of
course
like
the
rest
of
us
and
he
never
misses
one
of
them
exactly
said
ham
i
should
suppose
he
would
i
never
miss
a
meal
myself
if
i
can
help
it
but
do
you
think
three
meals
a
day
is
rather
short
allowance
for
a
boy
like
dab
miranda
thought
a
moment
but
then
she
answered
positively
no
i
do
not
if
he
does
as
well
at
each
one
of
them
as
dabney
is
sure
to
well
said
ham
that
was
in
his
old
clothes
that
were
too
tight
for
him
now
he
got
a
good
loose
fit
with
plenty
of
room
you
do
know
how
much
more
he
may
need
no
miranda
i
going
to
have
an
eye
on
dab
you
a
dear
good
fellow
anyway
said
miranda
with
one
of
her
very
best
smiles
and
i
hope
mother
have
the
house
all
ready
for
us
when
we
get
back
she
will
replied
ham
after
a
moment
spent
in
somewhat
thoughtful
silence
do
you
know
miranda
i
shall
hardly
be
easy
about
that
till
i
see
what
she
done
with
it
it
was
in
a
dreadfully
baggy
condition
chapter
iv
two
boys
one
pig
and
an
unfortunate
that
him
dab
was
standing
by
his
ponies
in
front
of
a
store
in
the
village
his
mother
was
making
some
purchases
in
the
store
and
dab
was
thinking
how
the
morris
house
would
look
when
it
was
finished
and
it
was
at
him
the
old
farmer
was
pointing
in
answer
to
a
question
which
had
just
been
asked
him
the
questioner
was
the
boy
who
had
bothered
poor
dick
lee
that
morning
and
he
was
now
evidently
making
a
sort
of
study
of
dab
kinzer
at
that
moment
however
a
young
lady
quite
young
came
tripping
along
the
sidewalk
and
was
stopped
by
dabney
with
there
jenny
walters
if
i
did
forget
my
label
why
dabney
is
that
you
how
you
startled
me
forgot
your
label
yes
said
dab
i
in
another
new
suit
today
and
i
meant
to
have
a
label
on
the
collar
with
my
name
on
it
you
have
known
me
then
but
i
know
you
now
exclaimed
jenny
why
i
saw
you
yesterday
yes
and
i
told
you
it
was
me
can
you
read
jenny
why
what
a
question
because
if
you
ca
it
wo
do
me
any
good
to
wear
a
label
dabney
kinzer
exclaimed
jenny
there
an
other
thing
you
ought
to
get
what
that
some
good
manners
said
the
little
lady
snappishly
think
of
your
stopping
me
in
the
street
to
tell
me
i
ca
read
then
you
must
forget
me
so
quick
said
dab
if
you
meet
my
old
clothes
anywhere
you
must
call
them
dick
lee
they
had
a
change
of
name
so
he
in
them
is
he
i
do
doubt
they
look
better
than
they
ever
did
before
jenny
walked
away
at
once
at
the
end
of
that
remark
holding
her
head
pretty
high
and
leaving
her
old
playmate
feeling
as
if
he
had
had
a
little
the
worst
of
it
that
was
often
the
way
with
people
who
stopped
to
talk
with
jenny
walters
and
she
was
not
as
much
of
a
favorite
as
she
otherwise
might
have
been
dabney
looked
after
her
with
his
mouth
puckered
into
shape
for
a
whistle
but
she
had
hardly
disappeared
before
he
found
himself
confronted
by
the
strange
young
gentleman
is
your
name
dabney
kinzer
yes
i
believe
so
well
i
ford
foster
from
new
york
come
over
here
to
buy
goods
suggested
dabney
or
to
get
something
to
eat
ford
foster
was
apparently
of
about
dab
age
but
a
full
head
less
in
height
so
that
there
was
more
point
in
the
question
than
there
seemed
to
be
but
he
treated
it
as
not
worthy
of
notice
and
asked
do
you
know
of
a
house
to
let
anywhere
about
here
house
to
let
suddenly
exclaimed
the
voice
of
kinzer
behind
him
much
to
dab
surprise
are
you
asking
about
a
house
whom
for
ford
foster
had
been
quite
ready
to
chaff
dick
lee
and
he
would
not
have
hesitated
about
trying
a
like
experiment
upon
dabney
kinzer
but
he
knew
enough
to
speak
respectfully
to
the
portly
and
lady
before
him
now
yes
madam
he
said
with
a
ceremonious
bow
i
wish
to
report
to
my
father
that
i
have
found
an
acceptable
house
in
this
vicinity
you
do
kinzer
was
reading
the
young
gentleman
through
and
through
as
she
spoke
but
she
followed
her
exclamation
with
a
dozen
questions
all
of
which
he
answered
with
a
good
deal
of
clearness
and
intelligence
she
wound
up
at
last
with
go
right
home
then
and
tell
your
father
the
only
good
house
to
let
in
this
neighborhood
will
be
ready
for
him
next
week
i
show
it
to
him
when
he
comes
but
he
better
see
me
at
once
dabney
jump
into
the
buggy
i
in
a
hurry
the
ponies
were
in
motion
up
the
street
before
ford
foster
quite
recovered
from
the
shock
of
being
told
to
go
right
home
a
very
remarkable
woman
he
muttered
as
he
turned
away
and
she
did
not
tell
me
a
word
about
the
house
after
all
i
must
make
some
more
inquiries
the
boy
is
actually
well
dressed
for
a
place
like
this
mother
said
dabney
as
they
drove
along
you
would
let
have
ham
house
would
you
no
indeed
but
i
do
mean
to
have
our
own
stand
empty
with
that
reply
a
great
deal
of
light
broke
in
upon
dab
mind
that
it
is
it
he
said
to
himself
as
he
touched
up
the
ponies
well
there
be
room
enough
for
all
of
us
there
and
no
mistake
but
what
ham
say
that
was
a
question
which
he
could
safely
leave
to
the
very
responsible
lady
beside
him
and
she
found
errands
enough
for
him
during
the
remainder
of
that
forenoon
to
keep
him
from
worrying
his
mind
about
any
thing
else
as
for
ford
foster
it
was
not
until
late
on
the
following
day
that
he
completed
all
his
inquiries
to
his
satisfaction
he
took
the
afternoon
train
for
the
city
almost
convinced
that
much
as
he
undoubtedly
knew
before
he
came
he
had
actually
acquired
a
good
deal
more
knowledge
which
might
be
of
some
value
ford
was
almost
the
only
passenger
in
the
car
he
had
selected
trains
going
towards
the
city
were
apt
to
be
thinly
peopled
at
that
time
of
day
but
the
empty
cars
had
to
be
taken
along
all
the
same
for
the
benefit
of
the
crowds
who
would
be
coming
out
later
in
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
the
would
have
made
more
money
with
full
loads
both
ways
but
it
was
well
they
did
not
have
a
full
load
on
that
precise
train
ford
had
turned
over
the
seat
in
front
of
him
and
stretched
himself
out
with
his
feet
on
it
it
was
almost
like
lying
down
for
a
boy
of
his
length
and
it
was
the
very
best
position
he
could
possibly
have
taken
if
he
had
known
what
was
coming
known
what
was
coming
yes
there
was
a
pig
coming
that
was
all
but
it
was
quite
enough
considering
what
that
pig
was
about
to
do
he
was
going
where
he
chose
just
then
and
not
only
had
he
chosen
to
walk
upon
the
but
he
had
also
made
up
his
mind
not
to
turn
out
for
that
locomotive
and
its
train
of
cars
he
saw
it
of
course
for
he
was
looking
straight
at
it
and
the
engineer
saw
him
but
it
would
have
been
well
for
the
pig
if
he
had
been
discovered
a
few
seconds
earlier
what
a
whistle
exclaimed
ford
foster
at
that
moment
it
sounds
more
like
the
squeal
of
an
iron
pig
than
any
thing
else
i
but
at
that
instant
there
came
to
him
a
great
jolt
and
a
shock
and
ford
found
himself
tumbled
all
in
a
heap
on
the
seat
where
his
feet
had
been
then
came
bounce
after
bounce
and
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
and
then
a
crash
off
the
track
shouted
ford
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
i
have
missed
it
for
any
thing
i
do
hope
though
there
has
anybody
been
killed
in
the
tremendous
excitement
of
the
moment
he
could
hardly
have
told
how
he
got
out
of
that
car
but
it
did
not
seem
ten
seconds
before
he
was
standing
beside
the
engineer
and
conductor
of
the
train
looking
at
the
battered
engine
as
it
lay
upon
its
side
in
a
deep
ditch
the
just
behind
it
was
broken
all
to
pieces
but
the
did
not
seem
to
have
suffered
very
much
and
nobody
was
badly
hurt
as
the
engineer
and
fireman
had
jumped
off
in
time
there
had
been
very
little
left
of
the
pig
but
the
conductor
and
the
rest
seemed
much
disposed
to
say
unkind
things
about
him
and
about
his
owner
and
about
all
the
other
pigs
they
could
think
of
this
train
never
get
in
on
time
said
ford
to
the
conductor
a
little
later
how
i
get
to
the
city
the
railway
man
was
not
in
the
best
of
humors
and
he
answered
a
little
groutily
well
young
man
i
do
suppose
the
city
could
get
along
without
you
over
night
the
junction
with
the
main
road
is
only
two
miles
ahead
and
if
you
a
good
walker
you
may
catch
a
train
there
some
of
the
other
passengers
none
of
whom
were
much
more
than
badly
shaken
up
or
down
had
made
the
same
discovery
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
there
was
a
long
straggling
procession
of
uncomfortable
people
marching
by
the
side
of
the
in
the
hot
sun
they
were
nearly
all
of
them
making
unkind
remarks
about
pigs
and
the
faculty
they
had
of
not
getting
out
of
the
way
the
conductor
was
right
however
and
nearly
all
of
them
managed
to
walk
the
two
miles
to
the
junction
in
time
to
go
in
on
the
other
train
ford
foster
was
among
the
first
to
arrive
and
he
was
likely
to
reach
home
in
season
in
spite
of
the
pig
and
his
outrageous
conduct
as
for
his
danger
he
had
hardly
thought
of
that
and
he
again
and
again
declared
to
himself
that
he
would
not
have
missed
so
important
an
adventure
for
any
thing
he
could
think
of
it
almost
sounded
once
or
twice
as
if
he
took
to
himself
no
small
amount
of
personal
credit
not
to
say
glory
for
having
been
in
so
remarkable
an
accident
and
come
out
of
it
so
well
ford
return
when
he
should
make
it
was
to
take
him
to
a
great
pompous
stylish
crowded
in
one
of
the
fashionable
streets
of
the
great
city
there
was
no
wonder
at
all
that
wise
people
should
wish
to
get
out
of
such
a
place
in
such
hot
weather
still
it
was
the
sort
of
home
ford
foster
had
been
acquainted
with
all
his
life
and
it
was
partly
owing
to
that
that
he
had
become
so
prematurely
knowing
he
knew
too
much
in
fact
and
was
only
too
well
aware
of
it
he
had
filled
his
head
with
an
unlimited
stock
of
information
as
well
as
with
a
firm
persuasion
that
there
was
little
more
to
be
had
unless
indeed
it
might
be
scraps
of
such
outside
knowledge
as
he
had
now
been
picking
up
over
on
long
island
in
one
of
the
large
of
the
at
about
eight
that
evening
a
gentleman
and
lady
with
a
fair
girl
of
about
nineteen
were
sitting
near
an
open
window
very
much
as
if
they
were
waiting
for
somebody
such
a
kind
motherly
lady
she
was
one
of
those
whom
no
one
can
help
liking
after
seeing
her
smile
once
or
hearing
her
speak
ford
foster
himself
could
not
have
put
in
words
what
he
thought
about
his
mother
and
yet
he
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
expressing
his
respect
for
his
father
or
his
unbounded
admiration
for
his
pretty
sister
annie
o
husband
exclaimed
foster
are
you
sure
none
of
them
were
injured
so
the
telegraphic
report
said
not
a
bone
broken
of
anybody
but
the
pig
that
got
in
the
way
how
i
wish
he
would
come
groaned
annie
have
you
any
idea
father
how
ford
could
get
to
the
city
not
clearly
my
dear
said
her
father
but
you
can
trust
ford
not
to
miss
any
opportunity
he
just
the
boy
to
look
out
for
himself
in
an
emergency
ford
foster
father
took
very
strongly
after
the
son
in
whose
presence
of
mind
and
ability
he
expressed
so
much
confidence
he
had
just
such
a
square
active
bustling
sort
of
body
several
sizes
larger
with
just
such
keen
penetrating
eyes
anybody
would
have
picked
him
out
at
a
glance
for
a
lawyer
and
a
good
one
that
was
exactly
what
he
was
and
if
anybody
had
become
acquainted
with
either
son
or
father
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
afterward
in
identifying
the
other
it
required
a
good
deal
more
than
the
telegraphic
report
of
the
accident
or
even
her
husband
assurances
to
relieve
the
motherly
anxiety
of
good
foster
or
even
to
drive
away
the
shadows
from
the
face
of
annie
no
doubt
if
ford
himself
had
known
the
state
of
affairs
in
his
family
circle
they
would
have
been
relieved
earlier
for
even
while
they
were
talking
about
him
he
had
reached
the
end
of
his
adventures
and
was
already
in
the
house
it
had
not
so
much
as
occurred
to
him
that
his
mother
would
hear
of
the
disaster
to
the
pig
and
the
until
he
himself
should
tell
her
and
so
he
had
made
sure
of
his
supper
down
stairs
before
reporting
his
arrival
he
might
not
have
done
it
perhaps
but
he
had
entered
the
house
by
the
lower
way
through
the
area
door
and
that
of
the
had
stood
temptingly
open
with
some
very
eatable
things
spread
out
upon
the
table
that
had
been
too
much
for
ford
after
his
and
his
and
his
long
walk
now
at
last
up
he
came
three
stairs
at
a
time
brimful
of
new
and
wonderful
experiences
to
be
more
than
a
little
astonished
by
the
manner
and
enthusiasm
of
his
welcome
why
mother
he
exclaimed
when
he
got
a
chance
for
a
word
you
and
annie
could
have
said
much
more
if
i
been
the
pig
himself
the
pig
said
annie
yes
the
pig
that
stopped
us
he
and
the
engine
wo
go
home
to
their
families
do
make
fun
of
it
ford
said
his
mother
gently
it
too
serious
a
matter
just
then
his
father
broke
in
almost
impatiently
with
well
ford
my
boy
have
you
done
your
errand
or
shall
i
have
to
see
about
it
myself
you
been
gone
two
days
hours
and
a
half
father
replied
ford
taking
out
his
watch
i
kept
an
exact
account
of
my
expenses
we
saved
the
cost
of
advertising
and
spent
it
on
railroading
said
his
father
with
a
laugh
but
ford
asked
annie
did
you
find
a
house
a
good
one
yes
added
foster
now
i
sure
you
safe
i
do
want
to
hear
about
the
house
it
all
right
mother
said
ford
confidently
the
very
house
you
told
me
to
hunt
for
neither
too
large
nor
too
small
i
only
seen
the
outside
of
it
but
every
thing
about
it
is
in
order
there
were
plenty
of
questions
to
answer
now
but
ford
was
every
way
equal
to
the
occasion
some
of
his
answers
might
have
made
kinzer
herself
open
her
eyes
for
the
material
for
them
had
been
obtained
from
her
own
neighbors
ford
report
in
fact
compelled
his
father
to
look
at
him
with
an
expression
of
face
which
very
plainly
meant
that
my
boy
he
resembles
me
i
was
just
like
him
at
his
age
be
just
like
me
at
mine
there
was
excellent
reason
beyond
question
to
approve
of
the
manner
in
which
the
young
gentleman
had
performed
his
errand
in
the
country
and
foster
promptly
decided
to
go
over
in
a
day
or
two
and
see
what
sort
of
an
arrangement
could
be
made
with
kinzer
chapter
new
neighbors
and
getting
settled
the
week
which
followed
the
was
an
important
one
the
improvements
on
the
morris
house
were
pushed
along
in
a
way
that
astonished
everybody
every
day
that
passed
and
with
every
worth
of
work
that
was
done
the
good
points
of
the
old
mansion
came
out
stronger
and
stronger
the
plans
of
kinzer
had
been
a
good
while
in
getting
ready
and
she
knew
exactly
what
was
best
to
be
done
at
every
hole
and
corner
within
a
few
days
after
ford
trip
of
investigation
he
and
his
father
came
over
from
the
city
and
foster
speedily
came
to
a
perfect
understanding
with
dabney
mother
a
very
sort
of
a
woman
the
lawyer
remarked
to
his
son
but
what
a
great
dangling
overgrown
piece
of
a
boy
that
is
still
he
seems
intelligent
and
you
may
find
him
good
company
no
doubt
of
it
said
ford
i
may
be
useful
to
him
too
he
looks
as
if
he
could
learn
if
he
only
had
a
fair
chance
i
should
say
so
responded
foster
we
must
not
expect
too
much
of
fellows
brought
up
away
out
here
as
he
has
been
ford
gravely
assented
and
they
went
back
to
report
their
success
to
foster
and
annie
there
was
a
great
surprise
in
store
consequently
for
the
people
of
the
village
early
in
the
following
week
it
was
rumored
from
house
to
house
the
kinzers
are
all
over
to
ham
morris
and
then
before
the
public
mind
had
become
sufficiently
settled
to
inquire
into
the
matter
the
rumor
changed
itself
into
a
piece
of
positive
news
the
widder
kinzer
moved
over
into
ham
house
bag
and
baggage
so
it
was
although
the
carpenters
and
painters
and
glaziers
were
still
at
work
and
the
piles
of
kinzer
furniture
had
to
be
stored
around
as
best
could
be
some
part
of
them
had
even
to
be
locked
up
over
night
in
one
of
the
barns
the
kinzers
for
generations
had
been
a
trifle
weak
about
furniture
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
had
been
so
little
room
for
human
beings
in
their
house
the
little
parlor
indeed
had
been
filled
until
it
put
one
in
mind
of
a
small
with
not
room
enough
to
show
the
stock
on
hand
and
some
of
the
other
parts
of
the
house
required
knowledge
and
care
to
walk
about
in
them
it
was
bad
for
a
small
house
truly
but
not
so
much
so
when
the
same
articles
were
given
a
fair
chance
to
spread
themselves
it
was
a
treat
to
dab
to
watch
while
the
new
carpets
were
put
down
and
see
how
much
more
at
home
and
comfortable
all
that
furniture
looked
after
it
was
moved
into
its
new
quarters
he
remarked
to
keziah
it
wo
be
of
any
use
for
anybody
to
try
to
sit
on
that
sofa
and
play
the
piano
they
have
to
get
up
and
come
over
kinzer
took
good
care
that
the
house
she
left
should
speak
well
of
her
to
the
eyes
of
foster
when
that
lady
came
to
superintend
the
arrival
of
her
own
household
goods
the
character
of
these
by
the
way
at
once
convinced
the
village
gossips
that
lawyer
foster
must
be
a
good
deal
forehanded
in
money
matters
and
so
he
was
even
more
so
than
his
furniture
indicated
ford
had
a
wonderful
deal
to
do
with
the
settlement
of
his
family
in
their
new
home
and
it
was
not
until
nearly
the
close
of
the
week
that
he
found
time
for
more
than
an
occasional
glance
over
the
north
fence
although
he
and
dab
had
several
times
exchanged
a
word
or
two
when
they
met
each
other
on
the
road
take
the
two
farms
together
his
father
had
said
to
him
and
they
make
a
really
fine
estate
i
learn
too
that
the
kinzers
have
other
property
your
young
acquaintance
is
likely
to
have
a
very
good
start
in
the
world
ford
had
found
out
very
nearly
as
much
as
that
on
his
own
account
but
he
had
long
since
learned
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
teach
his
father
any
thing
however
well
he
might
succeed
with
ordinary
people
and
so
he
said
nothing
dabney
said
kinzer
that
friday
evening
you
been
a
great
help
all
the
week
suppose
you
take
the
ponies
morning
and
ask
young
foster
out
for
a
drive
mother
exclaimed
samantha
i
shall
want
the
ponies
myself
i
some
calls
to
make
and
some
shopping
dabney
will
have
to
drive
no
sam
said
dabney
if
you
go
out
with
the
ponies
have
my
old
clothes
to
drive
you
i
go
and
speak
to
them
about
it
what
do
you
mean
asked
samantha
i
mean
with
dick
lee
in
them
that
would
be
just
as
well
said
kinzer
the
ponies
are
gentle
enough
and
dick
drives
well
he
be
glad
enough
to
go
dick
lee
indeed
began
samantha
a
fine
boy
interrupted
dab
and
he
beginning
to
dress
well
his
new
clothes
fit
him
beautifully
all
he
really
needs
is
a
shirt
and
i
give
him
one
mine
are
getting
too
small
samantha
fingers
fidgeted
a
little
with
the
tidy
they
were
holding
but
kinzer
said
composedly
well
dabney
i
been
thinking
about
it
you
ought
not
to
be
tied
down
all
the
while
suppose
you
take
next
week
pretty
much
to
yourself
samantha
wo
want
the
ponies
every
day
the
other
horses
have
all
got
to
work
or
i
let
you
have
one
of
them
dabney
got
up
for
want
of
a
better
answer
and
walked
over
to
where
his
mother
was
sitting
and
gave
the
thoughtful
matron
a
good
sounding
kiss
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
help
thinking
this
comes
of
ham
morris
and
my
new
rig
there
dabney
that
do
said
his
mother
but
how
you
spend
saturday
guess
i
take
ford
foster
out
in
the
bay
if
he
go
replied
dabney
i
run
over
and
ask
him
it
was
not
too
late
and
he
was
out
of
the
house
before
there
was
any
chance
for
further
remarks
from
the
girls
now
he
muttered
as
he
walked
along
i
have
to
see
old
lawyer
foster
and
foster
and
i
do
know
who
all
besides
i
do
like
that
just
as
he
came
to
the
north
fence
however
he
was
hailed
by
a
clear
voice
dab
kinzer
is
that
you
guess
so
said
dab
is
that
you
ford
i
was
just
going
over
to
your
house
said
ford
well
so
was
i
just
coming
over
to
see
you
i
been
too
busy
all
the
week
but
they
let
up
on
me
at
last
i
got
our
family
nearly
settled
replied
ford
and
i
thought
ask
if
you
would
like
to
go
out
on
the
bay
with
me
teach
you
to
catch
crabs
dabney
drew
a
long
astonished
sort
of
whistle
but
he
finished
it
with
that
about
what
i
was
thinking
of
there
plenty
of
crabs
and
got
a
boat
we
wo
want
a
heavy
one
for
just
us
two
all
right
then
we
begin
on
crabs
but
some
other
day
we
go
for
bigger
fish
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
week
got
it
all
to
myself
said
dab
we
can
have
all
sorts
of
a
good
time
we
can
have
the
ponies
too
when
we
want
them
that
about
as
good
as
it
knows
how
to
be
responded
the
young
gentleman
from
the
city
i
like
to
explore
the
country
you
going
to
have
a
nice
place
of
it
over
there
before
you
get
through
only
if
i
had
the
planning
of
that
house
i
have
set
it
back
farther
too
much
room
all
round
it
not
enough
trees
either
dab
came
stoutly
to
the
defence
of
not
only
that
house
but
of
architecture
generally
and
was
fairly
overwhelmed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
by
a
flood
of
big
words
from
a
boy
of
his
own
age
he
could
have
eaten
up
ford
foster
if
properly
cooked
he
felt
sure
of
that
but
he
was
no
match
for
him
on
the
building
question
on
his
way
back
to
his
new
home
however
after
the
discussion
had
lasted
long
enough
he
found
himself
inquiring
that
all
very
nice
but
what
can
he
teach
me
about
crabs
we
see
about
that
beyond
a
doubt
the
crab
question
was
of
special
importance
but
one
of
far
greater
consequence
to
dab
kinzer
future
was
undergoing
discussion
at
that
very
hour
hundreds
of
miles
away
quite
a
little
knot
of
people
there
was
in
a
hotel
parlor
and
while
the
blooming
miranda
now
morris
was
taking
her
share
of
talk
very
well
with
the
ladies
ham
was
every
bit
as
busy
with
a
couple
of
elderly
gentlemen
it
just
as
i
say
morris
said
one
of
the
latter
with
a
superfluous
show
of
energy
there
no
better
institution
of
its
kind
in
the
country
than
grantley
academy
i
send
my
own
boys
there
and
just
written
about
it
to
my
foster
the
lawyer
he
have
his
boy
there
this
fall
no
better
place
in
the
country
sir
but
how
about
the
expenses
mr
hart
asked
ham
fees
are
just
what
i
told
you
sir
a
mere
nothing
as
for
board
all
i
pay
for
my
boys
is
three
dollars
a
week
all
they
want
to
eat
sir
and
good
accommodations
happy
as
larks
sir
all
the
time
cheap
sir
cheap
if
ham
morris
had
the
slightest
idea
of
going
to
school
at
a
academy
miranda
place
in
the
improved
house
was
likely
to
wait
for
her
for
he
had
a
look
on
his
face
of
being
very
nearly
convinced
she
did
not
seem
at
all
disturbed
however
and
probably
she
knew
that
her
husband
was
not
taking
up
the
school
question
on
his
own
account
nevertheless
that
was
the
reason
why
it
might
have
been
interesting
for
dab
kinzer
and
even
for
his
knowing
neighbor
to
have
added
themselves
to
the
company
ham
and
miranda
had
fallen
in
with
on
their
both
of
the
boys
had
a
different
kind
of
thinking
on
hand
and
that
night
dab
dreamed
that
a
gigantic
crab
was
trying
to
pull
ford
foster
out
of
the
boat
while
the
latter
calmly
remarked
to
him
there
my
young
friend
did
you
ever
see
anything
just
like
that
before
chapter
vi
crabs
boys
and
a
that
saturday
morning
was
a
sad
one
for
poor
dick
lee
his
mother
the
previous
night
carefully
locked
up
his
elegant
apparel
the
gift
of
dabney
kinzer
it
was
done
after
dick
was
in
bed
and
when
daylight
came
again
he
found
only
his
old
clothes
by
the
bedside
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
bear
no
doubt
but
dick
had
been
a
bad
boy
on
friday
he
had
sold
his
fish
instead
of
bringing
them
home
and
then
had
gone
and
squandered
the
money
on
a
brilliant
new
red
necktie
dat
good
for
me
to
wear
to
meetin
said
lee
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
gorgeous
bit
of
cheap
silk
reckon
it
wo
be
wasted
on
any
boy
i
show
ye
wot
to
do
wid
yer
fish
you
too
mighty
fine
anyhow
dick
was
disconsolate
for
a
while
but
his
humility
took
the
form
of
a
determination
to
go
for
crabs
that
day
mainly
because
his
mother
had
long
since
set
her
face
against
that
tribe
of
animals
dey
a
wasteful
sort
ob
fish
remarked
lee
in
frequent
explanation
of
her
dislike
dey
all
and
no
body
like
some
folks
i
know
on
i
do
mean
de
kinzers
dey
all
got
body
nuff
and
yet
that
inlet
had
a
name
and
reputation
of
its
own
for
crabs
there
was
a
wide
reach
of
shallow
water
inside
the
southerly
point
at
the
mouth
where
over
several
hundred
acres
of
muddy
flats
the
depth
varied
from
three
and
a
half
to
eight
feet
with
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tides
that
was
a
sort
of
perpetual
and
there
it
was
that
dick
lee
determined
to
expend
his
energies
that
saturday
very
likely
there
would
be
other
crabbers
on
the
flats
but
dick
was
not
the
boy
to
object
to
that
provided
none
of
them
should
notice
the
change
in
his
raiment
at
an
early
hour
therefore
dab
and
ford
were
preceded
by
their
young
colored
friend
they
themselves
waiting
for
later
breakfasts
than
lee
was
in
the
habit
of
preparing
dick
ill
fortune
did
not
leave
him
when
he
got
out
of
sight
of
his
mother
it
followed
him
down
to
the
shore
of
the
inlet
and
compelled
him
to
give
up
for
that
day
all
idea
of
borrowing
a
respectable
boat
there
were
several
belonging
to
the
neighbors
from
among
which
dick
was
accustomed
to
take
his
pick
in
return
for
errands
run
and
other
services
rendered
to
their
owners
but
on
this
particular
morning
not
one
of
them
all
was
available
some
were
fastened
with
ugly
chains
and
padlocks
two
were
hauled
away
above
even
mark
and
so
dick
could
not
have
got
either
of
them
into
the
water
even
if
he
had
dared
to
try
and
as
for
the
rest
as
dick
said
guess
dar
owners
must
hab
come
and
borrered
the
consequence
was
that
the
young
fisherman
was
for
once
compelled
to
put
up
with
his
own
boat
or
rather
his
father
the
three
wise
men
of
gotham
were
not
much
worse
off
when
they
went
to
sea
in
a
bowl
than
was
dick
lee
in
that
rickety
little
old
punt
did
it
leak
well
not
so
very
much
with
no
heavier
weight
than
dick
but
there
was
reason
in
his
remark
that
dis
yer
a
mean
boat
to
frow
down
a
fish
in
when
you
cotch
done
suah
to
git
drownded
yes
and
the
crabs
would
get
their
feet
wet
and
so
would
dick
but
he
resigned
himself
to
his
circumstances
and
pushed
away
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
not
been
able
to
free
himself
from
a
lingering
fear
lest
his
mother
might
come
after
him
before
he
could
get
afloat
with
orders
for
some
duty
or
other
on
shore
and
that
would
have
been
worse
than
going
to
sea
in
the
little
old
scow
a
good
deal
reckon
it
all
right
said
dick
as
he
shoved
off
it
be
an
awful
risk
to
trus
dem
nice
in
de
ole
boat
suah
nice
clothes
nice
boats
a
good
many
other
nice
things
were
as
yet
beyond
the
reach
of
dick
lee
but
he
was
quite
likely
to
catch
as
many
crabs
as
his
more
aristocratic
neighbors
as
for
dabney
kinzer
and
his
friend
from
the
city
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
after
all
at
an
hour
which
indicated
either
smaller
appetites
than
usual
or
greater
speed
at
the
plenty
of
boats
i
should
say
remarked
ford
as
he
surveyed
the
little
landing
and
its
vicinity
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
a
few
fleets
of
his
own
all
sorts
any
of
fast
not
many
said
dab
the
big
and
little
have
to
be
built
so
they
will
stand
pretty
rough
water
how
are
the
same
thing
there
ham
morris
yacht
that
why
she
as
big
as
any
in
the
lot
bigger
but
she
do
show
it
ca
we
take
a
cruise
in
her
asked
ford
any
time
ham
lets
me
use
her
whenever
i
like
she
fast
enough
but
she
built
so
she
stand
any
thing
safe
as
a
house
if
handled
right
handled
ford
foster
expression
of
face
would
have
done
honor
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
or
the
chairman
of
the
naval
affairs
committee
in
congress
or
any
other
perfect
seaman
noah
included
it
seemed
to
say
as
if
any
boat
could
be
otherwise
than
well
sailed
with
me
on
board
dabney
however
even
while
he
was
talking
had
been
hauling
in
from
its
float
and
grapnel
about
ten
yards
out
at
low
water
the
very
little
that
called
him
owner
she
was
just
such
a
boat
as
kinzer
would
naturally
have
provided
for
her
boy
stout
and
sensible
without
any
bad
habits
of
upsetting
or
the
like
not
too
large
for
dabney
to
manage
all
alone
the
jenny
as
he
called
her
and
as
her
name
was
painted
on
the
stern
was
all
the
better
for
having
two
on
board
and
had
room
in
her
then
for
more
the
inlet
pretty
narrow
for
a
long
reach
through
the
marsh
said
dabney
and
as
crooked
as
a
ram
horn
i
steer
and
you
pull
till
we
out
o
that
and
then
i
take
the
oars
i
might
as
well
row
out
to
the
said
ford
as
he
pitched
his
coat
forward
and
took
his
seat
at
the
oars
all
ready
ready
said
dab
and
the
jenny
glided
gracefully
away
from
the
landing
with
the
he
gave
her
ford
foster
had
had
oars
in
his
hands
before
but
his
experience
had
been
limited
to
a
class
of
vessels
different
in
some
respects
from
the
one
he
was
in
now
he
was
short
of
something
at
all
events
it
may
have
been
skill
or
it
may
have
been
legs
or
discretion
but
whatever
was
lacking
at
the
third
or
fourth
stroke
the
went
a
little
too
deeply
below
the
smooth
surface
of
the
water
there
was
a
vain
tug
a
little
out
of
time
and
then
there
was
a
boy
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
a
pair
of
shoes
lifted
high
in
the
air
you
got
it
shouted
dabney
got
what
exclaimed
an
angry
voice
from
down
there
between
the
seats
caught
the
first
replied
dabney
that
what
we
call
it
can
you
steer
guess
i
better
row
no
you
wo
was
the
very
resolute
reply
as
ford
regained
his
seat
and
his
oars
i
catch
any
more
crabs
of
that
sort
i
a
little
out
of
practice
that
all
i
should
say
you
were
a
little
well
it
wo
hurt
you
is
much
of
a
pull
ford
would
have
pulled
it
now
if
he
had
blistered
all
the
skin
off
his
hands
in
doing
so
and
he
did
very
creditable
work
for
some
minutes
among
the
turns
and
windings
of
the
narrow
inlet
here
we
are
shouted
dabney
at
last
we
are
in
the
inlet
yet
but
it
widens
out
into
the
bay
that
the
bay
out
yonder
yes
and
the
island
between
that
and
the
ocean
no
a
mere
bar
of
sand
how
get
past
it
right
across
there
almost
in
a
straight
line
we
run
it
next
week
in
ham
yacht
splendid
right
in
the
mouth
of
that
inlet
on
the
ocean
side
hurrah
exclaimed
ford
i
in
for
that
is
the
bay
deep
not
very
replied
dabney
but
it
gets
pretty
rough
sometimes
ford
was
getting
pretty
red
in
the
face
just
then
with
his
unaccustomed
exercise
and
his
friend
added
you
need
pull
so
hard
we
almost
there
hullo
if
there
dick
lee
in
his
box
that
boat
drown
him
some
day
and
his
dad
too
but
just
see
him
pull
in
crabs
ford
came
near
catching
one
more
as
he
tried
to
turn
around
for
the
look
proposed
exclaiming
dab
let
get
to
work
as
quick
as
we
can
they
might
go
away
might
fly
no
but
do
they
go
and
come
well
you
go
and
drop
the
grapnel
over
the
bows
and
we
see
come
in
pretty
quick
the
grapnel
or
little
anchor
was
thrown
over
quickly
enough
and
the
two
boys
were
in
such
an
eager
haste
that
they
had
hardly
a
word
to
say
to
dick
though
he
was
now
but
a
few
rods
away
now
it
happened
that
when
ford
and
dab
came
down
to
the
water
that
morning
each
of
them
had
brought
a
load
the
former
had
only
a
neat
little
japanned
tin
box
about
as
big
as
his
head
and
the
latter
besides
his
oars
carried
a
seemingly
pretty
heavy
basket
lots
of
lunch
i
should
say
had
been
ford
mental
comment
but
he
had
not
thought
it
wise
to
ask
questions
plenty
of
lunch
in
that
box
thought
dab
at
the
same
moment
but
only
as
a
matter
of
course
and
they
were
both
wrong
lunch
was
the
one
thing
they
had
both
forgotten
but
the
box
and
the
basket
ford
foster
came
out
of
his
own
accord
with
the
secret
of
the
box
for
he
now
took
a
little
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
unlocked
it
with
an
air
of
look
at
this
will
you
dab
kinzer
looked
and
was
very
sure
he
had
never
before
seen
quite
such
an
assortment
of
of
many
sorts
and
sizes
and
of
which
looked
as
if
they
had
thus
far
spent
their
lives
on
dry
land
he
remarked
i
see
a
lot
of
things
we
can
use
one
of
these
days
but
there
is
time
to
go
over
now
let
go
for
the
crabs
what
made
you
bring
your
box
along
oh
replied
ford
i
left
my
rods
at
home
both
of
you
i
go
for
crabs
with
a
rod
do
you
but
you
can
take
your
pick
of
hooks
and
lines
crabs
hooks
and
lines
why
yes
you
do
mean
to
scoop
up
in
that
do
you
dab
looked
at
his
friend
for
a
moment
in
blank
amazement
and
then
the
truth
broke
upon
him
for
the
first
time
oh
i
see
you
never
caught
any
crabs
well
just
you
lock
up
your
and
i
show
you
it
was
not
easy
for
dab
to
keep
from
laughing
in
ford
foster
face
but
his
mother
had
not
given
him
so
many
lessons
in
for
nothing
and
ford
was
permitted
to
close
his
ambitious
casket
without
any
worse
annoyance
than
his
own
wounded
pride
gave
him
but
now
came
out
the
secret
of
the
basket
the
cover
was
jerked
off
and
nothing
was
revealed
but
a
varied
assortment
of
clams
large
and
small
but
mostly
of
good
size
tough
old
customers
that
no
amount
of
roasting
or
boiling
would
ever
have
prepared
for
human
eating
what
are
they
for
bait
yes
bait
weight
and
all
how
that
dabney
reply
was
to
draw
from
his
pocket
a
couple
of
long
strong
cords
bits
of
old
he
cracked
a
couple
of
clams
one
against
the
other
tied
the
fleshy
part
of
one
to
each
of
the
cords
tied
bits
of
shell
on
a
foot
or
so
from
the
ends
for
sinkers
handed
one
cord
to
ford
took
the
other
himself
and
laid
the
he
had
brought
with
him
down
between
them
saying
now
we
ready
drop
your
clam
down
to
the
bottom
and
it
wo
be
half
a
minute
before
you
feel
something
pull
on
it
then
you
draw
it
up
gently
steady
as
you
know
how
you
must
jerk
the
crab
loose
get
the
knack
of
it
in
five
minutes
it
all
knack
there
is
any
thing
else
so
stupid
as
a
crab
ford
watched
carefully
and
obeyed
in
silence
the
directions
he
had
received
in
a
minute
or
so
more
the
operation
of
the
was
called
for
and
the
fun
began
you
got
him
exclaimed
ford
in
a
loud
whisper
as
he
saw
dab
quickly
plunge
the
net
into
the
water
and
then
shake
out
of
it
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
a
great
sprawling
crab
he
a
whopper
he
do
for
one
there
one
on
mine
i
declare
he
let
go
you
jerked
the
clam
away
from
him
sink
it
again
he
mad
about
it
he
take
right
hold
again
he
pulling
now
or
it
another
one
let
him
pull
lift
him
easy
long
as
he
thinks
he
stealing
something
he
hold
on
there
he
comes
see
him
ford
saw
the
white
flesh
of
the
clam
coming
slowly
up
through
the
water
and
he
held
his
breath
for
just
behind
and
below
it
was
a
sprawling
shadowy
something
that
was
tugging
with
all
its
might
at
that
tough
it
an
awful
big
one
shall
i
scoop
him
no
indeed
i
want
to
scoop
him
myself
i
saw
how
you
did
it
splash
went
the
net
as
the
prize
came
nearer
the
surface
and
ford
began
somewhat
excitedly
to
shake
it
all
over
the
bottom
of
the
boat
why
where
that
crab
you
do
mean
to
say
he
was
quick
enough
to
dodge
away
quick
well
no
that
is
just
the
trouble
i
forgot
to
tell
you
to
scoop
way
under
him
you
hit
him
square
and
knocked
him
ever
so
far
the
water
deceives
your
eyes
drive
the
net
under
him
quick
and
then
lift
i
got
one
now
just
you
see
how
i
scoop
ford
felt
dreadfully
disappointed
over
the
loss
of
his
first
crab
but
the
rapidity
with
which
he
caught
the
knack
of
it
after
that
was
a
great
credit
to
him
he
did
not
miss
the
next
one
he
pulled
up
it
was
great
fun
but
it
had
its
slack
moments
and
in
one
of
these
dab
suddenly
exclaimed
the
young
black
rascal
if
he
has
gone
and
got
a
a
they
were
both
staring
at
the
old
punt
where
dick
lee
was
apparently
enjoying
the
most
extraordinary
good
fortune
yes
that
it
that
why
he
beats
us
so
badly
they
a
sight
clams
only
you
ca
always
get
one
i
wonder
where
he
picked
up
that
one
but
how
he
does
pull
in
we
doing
well
enough
began
dabney
when
suddenly
there
came
a
shrill
cry
of
pain
from
the
black
boy
punt
he
barefooted
shouted
dab
with
it
must
be
confessed
something
like
a
grin
and
one
of
the
little
pirates
has
pinned
him
with
his
nippers
that
was
the
difficulty
exactly
and
there
need
not
have
been
any
very
serious
result
of
such
an
expression
of
a
crab
bad
temper
but
dick
lee
was
more
than
ordinarily
averse
to
any
thing
like
physical
pain
and
the
crab
which
now
had
him
by
the
toe
was
a
very
muscular
and
vicious
specimen
of
his
quarrelsome
race
the
first
consequence
of
that
vigorous
nip
was
a
momentary
dance
up
and
down
in
the
punt
accompanied
by
exclamatory
howls
from
dick
but
not
by
a
word
of
any
sort
from
the
crab
the
next
consequence
was
that
the
crab
let
go
but
so
at
the
same
instant
did
the
rotten
board
in
the
upon
which
dick
lee
had
so
rashly
danced
it
let
go
of
the
rest
of
the
boat
so
suddenly
that
poor
dick
had
only
time
for
one
tremendous
yell
as
it
let
him
right
down
through
to
his
armpits
the
water
was
perfectly
smooth
but
the
boat
was
full
in
an
instant
and
nearly
a
bushel
of
and
crabs
were
manoeuvring
in
all
directions
around
the
woolly
head
which
was
all
their
late
captor
could
now
keep
in
sight
up
with
the
grapnel
ford
shouted
dab
take
an
oar
we
both
row
he
can
swim
like
a
duck
but
he
might
split
his
throat
or
get
scared
to
death
or
those
crabs
might
go
for
him
and
eat
him
up
how
he
does
yell
chapter
vii
a
very
accidental
call
at
the
very
moment
when
the
angry
crab
closed
his
nippers
on
the
bare
big
toe
of
dick
lee
and
his
shrill
note
of
discomfort
rang
across
the
inlet
the
shriller
whistle
of
the
engine
announced
the
arrival
of
the
morning
train
from
the
city
at
the
little
station
in
the
village
a
moment
or
so
later
a
very
pretty
young
lady
was
standing
beside
a
trunk
on
the
platform
trying
to
get
some
information
from
the
flagman
can
you
tell
me
where
foster
lives
that
the
lawyer
from
new
yark
yes
he
from
new
york
said
the
young
lady
smiling
in
his
face
where
does
he
live
he
got
the
sassiest
boy
thin
is
it
him
as
took
the
kinzer
house

think
likely
it
is
can

tell
me
how
to
get

of
the
gurrels

but

get
to
the
house
is
it
there

afther
goin
hey
michael
me
boy
bring
up
yer
owld
rattlethrap
and
take
the
leddy
thrunk
she
be
goin
to
the
kinzer
place
sharp
now
i
should
say
it
was
muttered
the
young
lady
as
the
remains
of
what
had
been
a
carryall
were
pulled
up
beside
the
platform
by
the
skinny
skeleton
of
what
might
once
have
been
a
horse
it
a
rattletrap
there
was
no
choice
however
for
that
was
the
only
public
conveyance
at
the
station
and
the
trunk
was
already
whisked
in
behind
the
dashboard
and
the
driver
was
waiting
for
her
he
could
afford
to
wait
as
it
would
be
some
hours
before
another
train
would
be
in
there
was
no
door
to
open
in
that
carriage
it
was
all
door
except
the
top
and
bottom
and
the
pretty
passenger
was
neither
helped
nor
hindered
in
finding
her
place
on
the
back
seat
if
the
flagman
was
more
disposed
to
ask
questions
than
to
answer
them
michael
said
few
words
of
any
kind
except
to
his
horse
to
him
indeed
he
kept
up
a
constant
stream
of
encouraging
remarks
the
greatest
part
of
which
would
have
been
difficult
for
an
ordinary
hearer
to
understand
very
likely
the
horse
knew
what
they
meant
for
he
came
very
near
breaking
from
a
limp
into
a
trot
several
times
under
the
stimulus
of
all
that
clucking
and
now
the
distance
was
by
no
means
great
and
michael
seemed
to
know
the
way
perfectly
at
least
he
answered
yes
indade
to
several
inquiries
from
his
passenger
and
she
was
compelled
to
be
satisfied
with
that
what
a
big
house
it
is
and
painters
at
work
on
it
too
she
exclaimed
just
as
michael
added
a
vigorous
jerk
of
the
reins
to
the
whoa
with
which
he
stopped
his
nag
in
front
of
an
open
gate
are
you
sure
this
is
the
place
yes
fifty
cints
mum
by
the
time
the
trunk
was
out
of
the
carriage
and
swung
inside
of
the
gate
the
young
lady
had
followed
but
for
some
reason
michael
at
once
sprang
back
to
his
place
and
whipped
up
his
limping
steed
it
may
have
been
from
the
fear
of
being
asked
to
take
that
trunk
into
the
house
for
it
was
not
a
small
one
the
young
lady
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
and
then
left
it
where
it
was
and
walked
on
up
to
the
house
no
bell
no
knocker
the
workmen
had
not
reached
that
part
of
their
improvements
yet
but
the
door
was
open
and
a
very
neatly
furnished
parlor
at
the
left
of
the
hall
seemed
to
say
come
right
in
please
and
in
she
went
such
an
arrival
could
not
possibly
have
escaped
the
notice
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
and
as
the
young
lady
from
the
railway
came
in
at
the
front
another
and
a
very
lady
marched
through
to
the
parlor
from
the
rear
each
one
would
have
been
a
puzzle
to
the
other
if
the
elder
of
the
two
had
not
been
kinzer
and
the
widow
had
never
been
very
much
puzzled
in
all
her
life
at
all
events
she
put
out
her
hand
with
a
cordial
smile
saying
miss
foster
is
it
not
i
am
kinzer
how
could
he
have
made
such
a
mistake
yes
miss
annie
foster
but
do
please
explain
where
am
i
and
how
do
you
know
me
the
widow
laughed
cheerily
how
do
i
know
you
my
dear
why
you
resemble
your
mother
almost
as
much
as
your
brother
ford
resembles
his
father
you
are
only
one
door
from
home
here
and
i
have
your
trunk
taken
right
over
to
the
house
please
sit
down
a
moment
ah
my
daughter
samantha
miss
foster
excuse
me
a
moment
while
i
call
one
of
the
men
by
the
time
their
mother
was
fairly
out
of
the
room
however
keziah
and
pamela
were
also
in
it
and
annie
thought
she
had
rarely
seen
three
girls
whose
appearance
testified
so
strongly
to
the
healthiness
of
the
place
they
lived
in
the
flagman
questions
and
annie
answers
were
related
quickly
enough
and
the
cause
of
michael
blunder
was
plain
at
once
the
parlor
rang
again
with
peals
of
laughter
for
dab
kinzer
sisters
were
ready
at
any
time
to
look
at
the
funny
side
of
things
and
their
accidental
guest
saw
no
reason
for
not
joining
them
your
brother
ford
is
on
the
bay
crabbing
with
our
dabney
remarked
samantha
as
the
widow
returned
but
annie
eyes
had
been
furtively
watching
her
baggage
through
the
window
and
saw
it
swinging
upon
a
broad
pair
of
shoulders
just
then
and
before
she
could
bring
her
mind
to
bear
upon
the
crab
question
keziah
kinzer
exclaimed
if
there
is
foster
coming
through
the
garden
gate
my
mother
and
annie
was
up
and
out
of
the
parlor
in
a
twinkling
followed
by
all
the
ladies
of
the
kinzer
family
it
was
really
quite
a
procession
now
if
foster
was
in
any
degree
surprised
by
her
daughter
sudden
appearance
or
by
her
getting
to
the
kinzer
house
first
instead
of
to
her
own
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
she
did
not
say
so
by
a
word
or
a
look
not
a
breath
of
it
but
for
all
the
of
the
city
lady
kinzer
knew
perfectly
well
there
was
something
odd
and
unexpected
about
it
all
if
samantha
had
noticed
this
fact
there
might
have
been
some
questions
asked
possibly
but
one
of
the
widow
most
rigid
rules
in
life
was
to
mind
her
own
business
the
girls
indeed
were
quite
jubilant
over
an
occurrence
which
made
them
at
once
so
well
acquainted
with
their
very
attractive
new
neighbor
and
they
might
have
followed
her
even
beyond
the
gate
in
the
north
fence
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
mother
all
they
were
allowed
to
do
was
to
go
back
to
their
own
parlor
and
hold
a
council
of
war
in
the
course
of
which
annie
foster
was
discussed
from
her
bonnet
to
her
shoes
foster
had
been
abundantly
affectionate
in
greeting
her
daughter
but
when
once
they
were
alone
in
the
wee
of
the
old
kinzer
homestead
she
put
her
arms
around
her
saying
now
my
darling
tell
me
what
it
all
means
why
mother
it
was
partly
my
mistake
and
partly
the
flagman
and
the
driver
and
i
sure
kinzer
was
kind
she
knew
me
before
i
said
a
word
by
my
resemblance
to
you
oh
i
do
mean
that
how
is
it
you
are
here
so
soon
i
thought
you
meant
to
make
a
long
visit
at
your
uncle
hart
so
i
would
mother
if
it
had
not
been
for
those
boys
your
cousins
annie
cousins
mother
you
never
saw
such
young
bears
in
all
your
life
they
tormented
me
from
morning
till
night
but
annie
i
hope
you
have
not
offended
offended
mother
aunt
maria
thinks
they
perfect
and
so
does
uncle
joe
they
let
them
pull
the
house
down
over
their
heads
you
think
but
annie
what
did
they
do
and
what
did
you
say
do
mother
i
could
tell
you
in
all
day
but
when
they
poured
ink
over
my
cuffs
and
collars
i
said
i
would
come
home
i
had
just
one
pair
left
white
to
wear
home
and
i
travelled
all
night
poor
foster
a
cold
shudder
went
over
her
at
the
idea
of
that
ink
among
the
spotless
contents
of
her
own
what
boys
they
must
be
but
annie
what
did
your
aunt
say
uncle
joe
laughed
till
he
cried
and
aunt
maria
said
will
be
boys
and
i
half
believe
they
were
sorry
but
that
was
only
a
sort
of
a
i
would
stay
there
another
day
annie
had
other
things
to
tell
and
long
before
she
had
finished
her
story
there
was
no
further
fault
to
be
found
with
her
for
losing
her
temper
still
her
mother
said
mildly
i
must
write
to
maria
at
once
for
it
wo
do
to
let
those
boys
make
trouble
between
us
annie
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
face
which
very
plainly
said
nobody
in
the
wide
world
could
have
the
heart
to
quarrel
with
you
chapter
viii
a
rescue
and
a
grand
good
time
dab
kinzer
and
his
friend
were
prompt
enough
coming
to
the
rescue
of
their
unfortunate
but
to
get
him
out
of
the
queer
wreck
he
had
made
of
that
punt
looked
like
a
tough
task
to
both
of
them
and
they
said
as
much
i
is
drownin
exclaimed
dick
heroically
as
the
other
boat
was
pulled
alongside
of
him
jest
you
take
your
and
save
dem
crabs
they
wo
drown
said
ford
but
they
get
away
said
dab
as
he
snatched
up
the
scoop
head
is
perfectly
level
on
that
point
the
of
the
old
punt
were
under
water
half
the
time
but
the
crabs
were
pretty
well
penned
in
even
a
couple
of
them
that
had
mistaken
dick
wool
for
another
were
secured
without
difficulty
in
spite
of
the
firmness
with
which
they
clung
to
their
prize
what
luck
he
been
having
said
ford
he
always
does
said
dab
i
say
dick
how
i
scoop

in
has
you
done
got
all
de
crabs
every
pinner
of
den
you
jest
wait
a
minute
waiting
was
all
that
was
left
them
to
do
for
the
shining
black
face
and
woolly
head
disappeared
almost
instantly
he
sunk
exclaimed
ford
there
he
comes
replied
dab
he
swum
ashore
from
here
and
not
half
try
why
i
could
swim
twice
as
far
as
that
myself
and
he
can
beat
me
could
you
i
could
that
was
the
first
time
dab
had
heard
his
city
acquaintance
make
a
confession
of
inability
and
he
could
see
a
more
than
usually
thoughtful
expression
on
his
face
the
coolness
and
skill
of
dick
lee
in
his
hour
of
disaster
had
not
been
thrown
away
upon
him
if
i
had
my
clothes
off
said
ford
i
believe
i
try

to
the
surface

her
in
while

crabbing
she
is
worth
mending
but

said
dick
as
he
grasped
the
gunwale
of
dab
boat
and
began
to
climb
over
hold
on
dick

is
on

dry
water
like

and
so
saying
dick
tumbled
over
in
with
a
spatter
which
made
ford
foster
tread
on
two
of
three
crabs
in
getting
away
from
it
it
was
not
the
first
time
by
many
that
dick
lee
had
found
himself
bathing
in
that
bay
without
any
time
given
him
to
undress
and
now
it
was
discovered
that
the
shipwrecked
crabber
had
never
for
one
instant
lost
his
hold
of
the
line
to
the
other
end
of
which
was
fastened
his
precious
they
made
a
regular
crabbing
crew
now
two
to
pull
up
and
one
to
scoop
in
and
never
had
the
sprawling
game
been
more
plentiful
on
that
pasture
or
more
apparently
in
a
greedy
hurry
to
be
captured
what
on
earth
shall
we
do
with
them
all
asked
ford
soon
we
got
enough
for
a
mess
for
both
our
folks
said
dab
we
quit
this
and
go
for
some
fish
the
clams
are
good
bait
and
we
can
try
some
of
your
tackle
ford
face
brightened
a
good
deal
at
that
suggestion
for
he
had
more
than
once
cast
a
crest
fallen
look
at
his
pretentious
box
but
he
replied
a
mess
how
many
crabs
can
one
man
eat
i
do
know
said
dab
it
depends
a
good
deal
on
who
he
is
then
if
he
eats
the
shells
he
ca
take
in
so
many
eat
de
shells
yah
yah
yah
dat
beats
my
mudder
she
allers
wot
a
waste
de
shells
make
laughed
dick
i
jest
wish
we
might
ketch
some
fish
i
das
kerry
home
no
crabs
it
does
look
as
if
we
got
as
many
as
we
know
what
to
do
with
remarked
dab
as
he
looked
down
on
the
sprawling
multitude
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
we
turn
the
clams
out
of
the
basket
and
fill
that
but
we
must
put
any
crabs
in
the
we
stow
all
forward
the
basket
held
more
than
half
a
bushel
but
there
was
still
a
heap
of
what
ford
foster
called
the
crusties
to
pen
up
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
that
duty
attended
to
the
grapnel
was
pulled
up
and
dick
was
set
at
the
oars
while
dab
selected
from
ford
box
just
the
hooks
and
lines
their
owner
had
made
least
account
of
what
we
catch
dab
anything
nobody
knows
till
he
done
it
perch
porgies
cunners
maybe
a
bass
or
a
but
more
cunners
than
any
thing
else
unless
we
strike
some
flounders
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
that
a
big
enough
assortment
to
set
up
a
on
if
we
catch
we
got
a
good
enough
day
anyhow
and
the
be
about
right
by
the
time
we
get
to
work
why
not
try
here
there
no
fish
to
speak
of
and
because
the
crabs
clean
your
hook
for
you
as
fast
as
you
can
put
the
bait
on
we
must
go
out
to
deeper
water
and
better
bottom
dick
knows
just
where
to
go
you
might
hang
your
line
out
all
day
and
not
get
a
bite
if
you
did
strike
the
right
spot
ford
made
no
answer
but
looked
on
very
seriously
while
dab
skilfully
slit
up
a
tough
old
dutch
clam
into
bait
it
was
beginning
to
dawn
upon
him
that
he
could
teach
the
boys
whether
black
or
white
very
little
about
fishing
he
even
allowed
dab
to
pick
out
a
line
for
him
and
to
put
on
the
hook
and
sinker
and
dick
lee
showed
him
how
to
fix
his
bait
so
de
fust
cunner
dat
rubs
agin
it
wo
knock
it
off
dem
awful
mean
fish
good
for
nuffin
but
bait
a
merry
party
they
were
and
the
salt
water
was
rapidly
drying
from
the
garments
of
the
colored
as
he
pulled
strongly
and
skilfully
out
into
the
bay
and
around
toward
a
deep
cove
at
the
north
of
the
inlet
mouth
then
indeed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
ford
foster
learned
what
it
was
to
catch
fish
not
but
what
he
had
spent
many
an
hour
and
even
day
on
and
about
other
waters
with
a
rod
or
a
line
in
his
hand
but
he
had
never
before
had
two
such
born
fishermen
at
his
elbow
to
take
him
to
the
right
place
precisely
and
at
the
right
time
and
then
to
show
him
what
to
do
when
he
got
there
it
was
fun
enough
for
the
fish
bit
remarkably
well
and
some
of
those
which
came
into
the
boat
were
of
a
very
encouraging
size
and
weight
there
was
one
curious
thing
about
those
heavier
fish
ford
would
have
given
half
the
hooks
and
lines
in
his
box
if
he
could
have
caught
from
dick
or
dab
the
mysterious
knack
they
seemed
to
have
of
coaxing
the
biggest
of
the
finny
folk
to
their
bait
and
then
over
the
side
of
the
boat
there
some
kind
of
favoritism
about
it
he
remarked
never
mind
ford
replied
dab
dick
and
i
are
better
acquainted
with
them
they
always
a
little
shy
with
strangers
at
first
they
really
mean
to
be
impolite
favoritism
it
was
nevertheless
and
there
was
now
no
danger
but
what
dick
would
be
able
to
appease
the
mind
of
his
mother
without
making
any
mention
of
the
crabs
at
last
almost
suddenly
and
as
if
by
common
consent
the
fish
stopped
biting
and
the
two
shore
boys
began
to
put
away
their
lines
going
to
quit
asked
ford
time
up
and
the
tide
turned
replied
dab
not
another
bite
most
likely
till
late
this
evening
we
might
as
well
pull
up
and
start
for
home
that
a
curious
kind
of
a
habit
for
fish
to
have
they
all
got
it
though
this
bay
mus
look
out
for
wot
lef
ob
de
ole
scow
on
de
way

remarked
dick
a
little
solemnly
i
boun
to
ketch
it
for
dat
ole
board
we
find
it
and
tow
it
in
said
dab
and
perhaps
we
can
get
it
mended
anyhow
you
can
go
with
us
next
week
we
going
to
make
a
cruise
in
ham

yelled
the
excited

fun
she
jest
de
bes
boat
on
dis
hull
bay
you
ai
foolin
me
is
yer
he
was
strongly
assured
that
his
young
white
associates
were
in
sober
earnest
about
both
their
purpose
and
their
promise
and
after
that
he
insisted
on
rowing
all
the
distance
home
on
the
way
the
old
punt
was
taken
in
tow
but
the
tide
had
already
swept
it
so
far
inside
the
mouth
of
the
inlet
that
there
was
less
trouble
in
pulling
it
the
rest
of
the
way
it
was
hardly
worth
the
labor
but
dab
knew
what
a
tempest
the
loss
of
it
might
bring
around
the
ears
of
poor
dick
when
they
reached
the
landing
and
began
to
their
very
brilliant
catch
dabney
said
now
dick
take
your
string
home
leave
that
basket
of
crabs
at
foster
and
then
come
back
with
the
basket
and
carry
the
rest
of
to
our
house
ford
and
i
see
to
the
rest
of
the
fish
i
have
caught
half
as
many
as
you
have
either
of
you
said
ford
when
he
saw
with
what
justice
the
fish
were
divided
in
three
piles
as
they
were
scooped
out
of
the
what
of
that
replied
dab
we
follow
fishermen
rules
down
this
way
share
and
share
alike
you
know
all
the
luck
is
outside
the
boat
they
say
once
the
fish
are
landed
your
luck
as
good
as
mine
do
they
always
follow
that
rule
the
man
that
broke
it
would
find
company
very
easily
hereabouts
next
time
he
wanted
to
go
no
nor
for
any
thing
else
nobody
boat
with
him
well
if
it
the
regular
thing
said
ford
hesitatingly
but
tell
who
really
caught
oh
some
of
yours
are
right
good
ones
your
string
look
big
enough
some
days
just
as
you
caught
would
it
yes
it
would
do
you
imagine
we
can
pull
in
every
time
like
we
did
this
morning
crabs
nor
fish
no
i
not
anyhow
i
learned
some
things
i
guess
likely
we
go
for
some
more
next
week
now
for
a
tug
ai
they
heavy
though
the
boat
had
already
been
made
fast
and
the
two
boys
picked
up
their
strings
of
fish
two
for
each
after
dick
lee
had
started
for
home
and
heavy
things
they
were
to
carry
under
that
hot
sun
come
and
show
the
whole
lot
to
my
mother
said
ford
before
you
take
yours
into
the
house
i
like
to
have
her
see
them
all
all
right
replied
dab
but
he
little
dreamed
what
was
coming
for
when
he
and
ford
marched
proudly
into
the
with
their
finny
prizes
dabney
found
himself
face
to
face
with
not
good
foster
but
as
he
thought
the
most
beautiful
young
lady
he
had
ever
seen
ford
foster
shouted
annie
you
here
well
i
never
but
dab
kinzer
wished
all
those
fish
safely
back
again
swimming
in
the
bay
chapter
ix
there
are
different
kinds
of
boys
ham
morris
was
a
thoughtful
and
fellow
beyond
a
doubt
and
he
was
likely
to
be
a
valuable
friend
for
a
growing
boy
like
dab
kinzer
it
is
not
everybody
who
would
find
time
during
his
to
hunt
up
even
so
pretty
a
village
as
grantley
and
inquire
into
questions
of
board
and
lodging
and
schooling
that
was
precisely
what
ham
did
however
and
miranda
went
with
him
of
course
myers
to
the
hospitalities
of
whose
cool
and
house
he
had
been
commended
by
hart
was
so
crowded
full
with
summer
boarders
liberally
advertised
for
in
the
great
city
that
she
had
hardly
a
corner
left
in
which
to
stow
away
ham
and
his
bride
for
even
one
night
she
was
glad
enough
however
that
she
had
made
the
effort
and
found
one
after
she
discovered
the
nature
of
the
stranger
errand
in
grantley
and
that
it
included
winter
board
for
a
whole
boy
there
was
a
look
of
undisguised
astonishment
on
the
faces
of
the
regular
guests
when
they
gathered
for
the
next
meal
it
happened
to
be
supper
but
they
all
looked
at
the
table
and
then
at
one
another
it
was
a
pity
ham
and
miranda
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
those
glances
or
else
that
they
did
not
make
a
longer
stay
with
myers
they
might
have
learned
more
about
her
and
her
if
not
about
the
academy
as
it
was
they
only
gathered
a
very
high
opinion
of
her
cookery
and
hospitality
as
well
as
an
increase
of
respect
for
the
institution
of
learning
and
for
that
excellent
gentleman
hart
with
a
dim
hope
that
dabney
kinzer
might
be
permitted
to
enjoy
the
inestimable
advantages
offered
by
grantley
and
myers
and
the
society
of
hart
two
wonderful
boys
miranda
was
inclined
to
stand
up
for
her
brother
somewhat
but
finally
agreed
with
ham
that
what
dabney
needs
is
schooling
and
polish
my
dear
it
be
good
for
him
to
board
in
the
same
house
with
two
such
complete
young
gentlemen
as
the
hart
boys
of
course
ham
and
then
too
we
feel
sure
of
his
having
plenty
to
eat
there
was
almost
too
much
on
the
table
not
if
the
boarders
had
all
been
boys
of
dab
age
and
with
his
appetite
myers
is
evidently
accustomed
to
provide
for
them
i
should
say
so
she
was
and
ham
and
miranda
left
grantley
next
morning
after
a
very
early
breakfast
and
when
the
regular
boarders
came
to
theirs
they
might
have
guessed
at
once
that
the
transient
guests
had
gone
they
even
guessed
it
out
loud
at
dinner
and
at
supper
myers
had
given
ham
and
his
bride
a
world
of
interesting
information
about
grantley
and
the
things
and
people
in
it
but
there
was
one
thing
she
had
forgotten
or
neglected
to
mention
she
had
failed
to
tell
them
that
the
house
she
lived
in
and
the
outlying
farm
belonging
to
it
and
nearly
all
the
effects
it
contained
were
the
property
of
joseph
hart
having
cost
that
gentleman
very
little
more
than
a
sharp
lawsuit
neither
did
she
say
a
word
about
how
long
a
time
he
had
given
her
to
pay
him
his
price
for
it
all
that
was
her
own
private
affair
and
none
of
ham
business
or
miranda
still
it
might
have
had
its
importance
in
their
minds
if
they
had
been
informed
of
it
perhaps
too
some
of
their
rosy
impressions
might
have
been
a
little
modified
if
they
could
have
been
at
the
of
the
hart
homestead
the
morning
after
annie
foster
sudden
departure
the
table
truly
was
there
as
usual
with
the
on
it
and
there
were
husband
and
wife
at
either
end
but
the
two
side
seats
were
vacant
where
are
joe
and
foster
maria
asked
hart
i
sure
they
up
father
i
heard
them
come
down
stairs
an
hour
ago
i
ca
wait
for
them
you
came
home
late
last
night
and
they
have
seen
you
since
annie
went
away
there
had
been
a
suppressed
sound
of
whispers
in
the
entry
and
the
door
had
been
held
open
about
half
an
inch
by
some
hand
on
the
other
side
it
is
possible
therefore
that
hart
reply
was
heard
outside
oh
i
see
it
about
annie
look
here
maria
they
may
have
gone
a
little
too
far
but
if
annie
ca
take
a
joke
so
i
tried
to
say
to
her
began
his
wife
but
at
that
instant
the
whispers
in
the
entry
swelled
suddenly
to
loud
voices
and
two
boys
came
noisily
in
and
filled
the
side
chairs
at
the
table
sit
down
my
dears
said
hart
with
an
admiring
glance
from
one
to
the
other
i
have
told
your
father
about
the
sad
trick
you
played
upon
your
cousin
yes
you
young
rogues
added
hart
with
affected
sternness
you
have
driven
her
out
of
the
house
joe
said
the
boy
on
the
left
to
his
brother
across
the
table
you
glad
she
gone
you
bet
i
am
she
too
stiff
and
steep
for
me
spoiled
all
the
fun
we
had
and
so
you
spoiled
her
cuffs
and
collars
for
her
it
was
too
bad
altogether
i
afraid
there
wo
be
much
comfort
for
anybody
in
this
house
till
you
two
get
back
to
grantley
fuz
said
joe
do
you
hear
that
they
going
to
give
us
another
term
at
grantley
i
do
care
how
soon
we
go
so
we
have
got
to
board
at
old
mother
myers
i
ca
say
about
that
said
hart
i
half
made
her
a
promise
that
we
board
there
exclaimed
fuz
rebelliously
now
boys
said
their
mother
in
a
gentle
voice
that
sounded
a
little
like
good
foster
but
joe
sustained
his
brother
with
and
not
half
enough
of
it
i
just
wo
stand
it
another
winter
i
not
so
sure
it
will
be
necessary
after
all
said
their
father
who
seemed
to
have
dismissed
annie
grievance
from
his
mind
for
the
present
your
cousin
ford
is
sure
to
go
and
i
almost
certain
of
another
boy
besides
the
missionary
son
if
she
gets
a
few
others
herself
her
house
be
full
enough
and
you
can
board
somewhere
else
hurrah
for
that
shouted
fuz
and
if
the
new
house
does
feed
us
well
we
tear
it
down
if
you
do
tear
ours
down
before
you
go
i
be
satisfied
maria
you
must
write
to
your
sister
and
smooth
the
matter
over
boys
will
be
boys
and
i
would
like
to
have
any
coolness
spring
up
understand
it
that
was
very
nearly
all
that
was
said
about
it
and
the
two
boys
evidently
had
had
no
need
for
any
hesitation
in
coming
in
to
breakfast
they
were
not
so
a
pair
as
boys
go
although
it
may
be
few
other
people
would
have
seen
so
much
to
admire
in
them
as
their
mother
did
joe
the
elder
was
a
loud
boy
of
seventeen
or
thereabouts
with
a
perpetual
grin
on
his
face
as
if
he
had
discovered
in
this
world
nothing
but
a
long
procession
of
things
to
be
laughed
at
foster
so
named
after
his
lawyer
relative
was
a
year
and
a
half
younger
but
nearly
as
tall
as
joe
he
was
paler
but
with
hair
and
eyes
as
dark
and
he
wore
a
sort
of
habitual
as
if
his
mind
were
all
the
while
inquiring
if
anybody
within
sight
happened
to
have
any
thing
he
wanted
they
both
bore
a
strong
likeness
to
their
father
only
they
missed
something
bluff
and
hearty
in
his
accustomed
manner
and
they
each
had
also
a
little
suggestion
of
their
mother
that
did
not
however
go
so
far
as
to
put
anybody
in
mind
of
their
aunt
foster
nobody
need
have
failed
to
see
at
all
events
after
watching
one
or
two
of
their
glances
at
each
other
that
they
were
the
very
boys
to
play
the
meanest
kind
of
practical
jokes
when
they
could
do
it
safely
there
is
really
no
accounting
for
boys
and
joe
and
fuz
therefore
might
fairly
be
set
down
among
the
unaccountables
there
was
no
sort
of
wonder
that
their
mother
and
their
father
should
be
quite
willing
to
have
them
spend
of
the
year
at
and
as
much
as
possible
of
the
remainder
somewhere
else
than
at
home
after
hart
went
out
to
his
business
that
morning
and
hart
set
herself
about
her
usual
duties
joe
and
fuz
took
with
them
into
the
street
the
whole
grantley
question
we
have
to
go
fuz
of
course
but
we
must
have
more
to
eat
and
more
fun
than
we
had
last
time
ford
coming
is
he
the
little
prig
we
roast
him
so
we
will
that
young
missionary
look
out
about
him
joe
while
he
at
our
house
he
coming
right
here
you
know
do
you
be
afraid
his
folks
are
old
friends
of
mother
we
let
up
on
him
till
we
get
him
safe
to
grantley
then
we
fix
him
they
had
plots
and
plans
enough
to
talk
about
but
neither
they
nor
any
of
the
boys
they
named
nor
any
of
the
other
boys
they
did
not
name
had
the
least
idea
of
what
the
future
really
had
in
store
for
them
dab
kinzer
and
ford
foster
in
particular
had
no
idea
that
the
world
contained
such
a
place
as
grantley
or
such
a
landlady
as
myers
they
had
as
little
suspicion
of
them
as
they
had
had
of
finding
annie
foster
in
the
that
day
when
they
walked
in
with
their
famous
strings
of
fish
ford
kissed
his
sister
but
that
operation
hardly
checked
him
for
an
instant
in
his
voluble
narrative
of
the
stirring
events
of
his
first
morning
on
the
bay
there
was
really
little
for
anybody
else
to
do
but
to
listen
and
it
was
worth
hearing
there
was
no
sort
of
interruption
on
the
part
of
the
audience
but
the
moment
ford
paused
for
breath
his
mother
said
are
you
sure
the
black
boy
was
not
hurt
ford
hurt
mother
why
he
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
the
rest
all
know
him
and
they
went
right
past
my
hook
to
his
all
the
while
dear
me
exclaimed
foster
i
forgot
annie
this
is
friend
dabney
kinzer
our
neighbor
wo
you
shake
hands
with
me
mr
kinzer
said
annie
with
a
malicious
twinkle
of
fun
in
her
merry
blue
eyes
poor
dabney
he
had
been
in
quite
a
state
of
mind
for
at
least
three
minutes
but
he
would
hardly
have
been
his
own
mother
son
if
he
had
let
himself
be
entirely
posed
up
rose
his
long
right
arm
with
the
heavy
string
of
fish
at
the
end
of
it
and
annie
fun
broke
out
into
a
musical
laugh
just
as
her
brother
exclaimed
there
now
i
like
to
see
the
other
boy
of
your
size
can
do
that
look
here
dab
where
you
get
your
training
i
must
drop
the
fish
you
see
began
dab
but
ford
interrupted
him
with
indeed
you
given
me
half
i
got
as
it
is
annie
have
you
looked
at
the
crabs
you
ought
to
have
seen
dick
lee
with
a
lot
of
gripping
in
his
hair
in
his
hair
when
he
was
down
through
the
bottom
of
his
boat
they
have
eaten
him
up
if
they
had
a
chance
you
see
he
no
shell
on
him
exactly
said
annie
as
dab
lowered
his
fish
well
dabney
i
wish
you
would
thank
your
mother
for
me
for
sending
my
trunk
over
your
sisters
too
i
no
doubt
we
shall
be
very
neighborly
it
was
wonderfully
pleasant
to
be
called
by
his
first
name
by
so
very
pretty
a
young
lady
and
yet
it
seemed
to
bring
up
something
curious
into
dabney
kinzer
throat
she
considers
me
a
mere
boy
and
she
means
i
better
take
my
fish
right
home
was
the
next
thought
that
came
to
him
and
he
was
right
to
a
fraction
so
the
great
lump
in
his
throat
took
a
very
wayward
and
boyish
form
and
came
out
as
a
reply
accompanied
by
a
low
bow
i
will
thank
you
foster
i
see
you
ford
about
monday
and
the
yacht
annie
and
then
he
marched
out
with
his
fish
mother
did
you
hear
him
call
me
yes
and
i
heard
you
call
him
but
he
only
a
boy
i
do
care
exclaimed
ford
he
an
odd
fellow
but
he
a
good
one
did
you
see
how
wonderfully
strong
he
is
in
his
arms
i
lift
these
fish
at
to
save
my
life
he
knew
for
he
had
been
trying
his
best
with
his
own
it
was
quite
likely
that
dab
kinzer
rowing
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
had
developed
in
him
greater
strength
of
muscle
than
even
he
himself
was
aware
of
but
for
all
that
he
went
home
with
his
very
ears
tingling
could
she
have
thought
me
or
impertinent
he
muttered
to
himself
thought
about
him
poor
dab
kinzer
annie
foster
had
so
much
else
to
think
of
just
then
for
she
was
compelled
to
go
over
for
ford
benefit
the
whole
story
of
her
tribulations
at
her
uncle
and
the
many
rudenesses
of
joe
hart
and
his
brother
fuz
they
ought
to
be
drowned
said
ford
indignantly
in
ink
added
annie
just
as
they
drowned
my
poor
cuffs
and
collars
chapter
x
a
cruise
in
the
swallow
look
at
dabney
kinzer
said
jenny
walters
to
her
mother
in
church
the
next
morning
did
you
ever
see
anybody
hair
as
smooth
as
that
smooth
it
was
certainly
and
he
looked
all
over
as
if
he
had
given
all
the
care
in
the
world
to
his
personal
appearance
how
was
annie
foster
to
guess
that
he
had
gotten
himself
up
so
unusually
on
her
account
she
did
not
guess
it
but
when
she
met
him
at
the
after
service
she
was
careful
to
address
him
as
kinzer
and
that
made
poor
dabney
blush
to
his
very
eyes
there
he
exclaimed
i
know
it
know
what
asked
annie
know
what
you
thinking
do
you
indeed
yes
you
think
i
like
the
crabs
what
you
mean
you
think
i
was
green
enough
till
you
spoke
to
me
and
now
i
boiled
red
in
the
face
annie
could
not
help
laughing
a
little
quiet
sort
of
a
laugh
but
she
was
beginning
to
think
her
brother
friend
was
not
a
bad
specimen
of
a
long
island
country
boy
she
briskly
turned
away
the
small
remains
of
that
conversation
from
crabs
and
their
color
but
she
told
her
mother
on
their
way
home
she
was
sure
dabney
would
be
a
capital
associate
for
ford
that
young
gentleman
was
tremendously
of
the
same
opinion
he
had
come
home
the
previous
evening
from
a
long
conference
with
dab
brimful
of
the
proposed
yachting
cruise
and
his
father
had
freely
given
his
consent
much
against
the
inclinations
of
foster
my
dear
said
the
lawyer
i
feel
sure
a
woman
of
unusual
good
sense
would
not
permit
her
son
to
go
out
in
that
way
if
she
did
not
feel
safe
about
him
he
has
been
brought
up
to
it
you
know
and
so
has
the
colored
boy
who
is
to
go
with
them
yes
mother
argued
ford
there
is
half
the
danger
there
is
in
driving
around
new
york
in
a
carriage
there
might
be
a
storm
she
timidly
suggested
the
horses
might
run
away
or
you
might
get
upset
so
might
a
carriage
the
end
of
it
all
was
however
that
ford
was
to
go
and
annie
was
more
than
half
sorry
she
could
not
go
with
them
in
fact
she
said
so
to
dabney
himself
as
soon
as
her
little
laugh
was
ended
that
sunday
morning
some
time
or
other
i
be
glad
to
have
you
replied
dab
very
politely
but
not
this
trip
why
not
we
mean
to
go
right
across
the
bay
and
try
some
fishing
could
i
fish
well
no
i
do
think
you
could
why
could
i
because
well
because
most
likely
you
be
too
by
the
time
we
got
there
just
then
a
low
clear
voice
behind
dabney
quietly
remarked
how
smooth
his
hair
is
dab
face
turned
red
again
annie
foster
had
heard
it
as
distinctly
as
he
had
and
she
walked
right
away
with
her
mother
for
fear
she
should
laugh
again
it
my
own
hair
jenny
walters
said
dab
almost
savagely
as
he
turned
around
i
should
hope
it
was
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
go
to
church
for
anyhow
to
hear
people
talk
about
sailing
and
fishing
how
much
do
you
a
young
lady
like
miss
foster
cares
about
small
boys
or
little
girls
either
not
much
but
annie
and
i
mean
to
have
a
good
sail
before
long
annie
and
i
jenny
pert
little
nose
seemed
to
turn
up
more
than
ever
as
she
walked
away
for
she
had
not
beaten
her
old
playfellow
quite
as
badly
as
usual
there
were
several
sharp
things
on
the
very
tip
or
her
tongue
but
she
was
too
much
put
out
and
vexed
to
try
to
say
them
just
then
dab
made
the
rest
of
his
way
home
without
any
further
haps
or
mishaps
a
sail
on
the
bay
was
nothing
so
new
or
wonderful
for
him
to
look
forward
to
and
so
that
sunday
went
by
a
good
deal
like
all
his
other
sundays
as
for
ford
foster
on
the
contrary
his
mind
was
in
a
stew
and
turmoil
all
day
in
fact
just
after
tea
that
evening
his
father
asked
him
what
book
is
that
you
are
reading
ford
captain
cook
voyages
and
the
other
in
your
lap
robinson
crusoe
well
you
might
have
worse
books
than
they
are
that
a
fact
even
for
sunday
though
you
ought
to
have
better
but
which
of
them
do
you
and
dabney
kinzer
mean
to
imitate
crusoe
promptly
responded
ford
i
see
and
so
you
got
dick
lee
to
go
along
as
your
man
friday
he
dab
man
not
mine
oh
and
you
mean
to
be
crusoe
number
two
well
do
get
cast
away
on
any
desolate
island
that
all
ford
slipped
into
the
library
and
put
the
books
away
it
had
been
samantha
kinzer
room
and
had
plenty
of
in
addition
to
the
elegant
cases
foster
had
brought
from
the
city
with
him
for
samantha
was
inclined
to
be
of
a
literary
turn
of
mind
all
the
cases
and
shelves
were
full
too
but
not
on
any
one
of
them
was
ford
foster
able
to
discover
a
volume
he
cared
to
take
out
with
him
in
place
of
cook
or
crusoe
the
next
morning
within
half
an
hour
after
breakfast
every
member
of
the
two
families
was
down
at
the
landing
to
see
their
young
sailors
make
their
start
and
they
were
all
compelled
to
admit
that
dab
and
dick
seemed
to
know
precisely
what
they
were
about
as
for
ford
that
young
gentleman
was
wise
enough
with
all
those
eyes
watching
him
not
to
try
any
thing
that
he
was
not
sure
of
though
he
carefully
explained
to
annie
dab
is
captain
you
know
i
under
his
orders
dick
lee
was
hardly
the
wisest
fellow
in
the
world
for
he
added
encouragingly
and
you
doin
for
a
green
hand
you
is
the
wind
was
blowing
right
off
shore
and
did
not
seem
to
promise
any
thing
more
than
a
smart
breeze
it
was
easy
enough
to
handle
the
little
craft
in
the
inlet
and
in
a
marvellously
short
time
she
was
dancing
out
upon
the
blue
waves
of
the
spreading
bay
it
was
a
good
deal
more
like
a
sound
than
any
sort
of
a
bay
with
that
long
low
narrow
cutting
it
off
from
the
ocean
i
do
wonder
ham
morris
called
her
the
said
ford
how
she
skims
can
you
get
in
under
the
deck
there
forward
that
the
cabin
yes
that
the
cabin
replied
dab
but
ham
had
the
door
put
in
with
a
slide
it
fitted
with
rubber
we
can
put
our
things
in
there
but
it
too
small
for
any
thing
else
what
it
made
so
tight
for
oh
ham
says
he
made
his
yacht
a
those
places
at
the
sides
and
under
the
seats
are
all
she
might
capsize
but
never
sink
do
you
see
i
see
how
it
blows
it
a
little
fresh
now
we
are
getting
away
from
under
the
land
you
like
to
be
wrecked
good
fun
said
ford
i
got
wrecked
on
the
cars
the
first
time
i
came
over
here
on
the
cars
why
yes
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
that
then
followed
a
very
vivid
and
graphic
account
of
the
sad
fate
of
the
pig
and
the
locomotive
the
wonder
was
how
ford
should
have
failed
to
give
dab
that
story
before
no
such
failure
would
have
been
possible
if
his
head
and
tongue
had
not
been
so
wonderfully
busy
about
so
many
other
things
ever
since
his
arrival
i
glad
it
was
i
instead
of
annie
he
said
at
length
of
course
did
you
tell
me
she
came
through
all
alone
yes
and
she
did
like
it
much
either
travelled
all
night
she
ran
away
from
those
cousins
of
mine
oh
but
wo
i
pay
them
off
when
i
get
to
grantley
where
that
what
did
they
do
the
swallow
was
flying
along
nicely
now
with
dab
at
the
tiller
and
dick
lee
tending
sail
and
dab
could
listen
with
all
his
ears
to
account
of
his
sister
tribulations
and
the
merciless
practical
jokes
of
the
hart
boys
ai
they
older
and
bigger
than
you
asked
dabney
as
ford
closed
his
recital
what
can
you
do
with
two
of
them
they
ca
box
worth
a
cent
and
i
can
anyhow
i
mean
to
teach
them
better
manners
you
can
box
had
a
splendid
teacher
put
me
up
to
all
sorts
of
things
will
you
show
me
how
when
we
get
back
we
can
practise
all
we
choose
i
two
pair
of
gloves
hurrah
for
that
ease
her
dick
it
blowing
pretty
fresh
we
have
a
tough
time
tacking
home
against
such
a
breeze
as
this
maybe
change
before
night
dab
calmly
remarked
dick
we
a
mile
to
run
well
what
of
it
is
you
goin
fo
de
inlet
of
course
what
else
can
we
do
that
what
we
started
for
looks
kind
o
dirty
dat
all
so
far
as
ford
could
see
both
the
sky
and
the
water
looked
clean
enough
but
dick
was
entirely
right
about
the
weather
in
fact
if
captain
dabney
kinzer
had
been
a
more
experienced
and
prudent
seaman
he
would
have
kept
the
swallow
inside
the
bar
that
day
at
any
risk
of
ford
foster
good
opinion
as
it
was
even
dick
lee
keen
eyes
hardly
comprehended
how
threatening
was
the
foggy
haze
that
was
lying
low
on
the
water
miles
and
miles
away
to
seaward
it
was
magnificently
exciting
fun
at
all
events
and
the
swallow
fully
merited
all
that
had
been
said
in
her
favor
the
mile
to
run
was
a
very
short
one
and
it
seemed
to
ford
foster
that
the
end
of
it
would
bring
them
up
high
and
dry
on
the
sandy
beach
of
the
island
the
narrow
strait
of
the
inlet
between
the
bay
and
the
ocean
was
hardly
visible
at
any
considerable
distance
it
opened
to
view
however
as
they
drew
near
and
dab
kinzer
rose
higher
than
ever
in
his
good
opinion
as
the
swift
little
vessel
he
was
steering
shot
unerringly
into
the
contracted
channel
ai
we
pretty
near
where
you
said
we
were
to
try
for
some
fish
he
asked
just
outside
there
get
the
grapnel
ready
dick
sharp
now
sharp
it
was
and
ford
himself
lent
a
hand
and
in
another
moment
the
white
sails
went
down
jib
and
main
the
swallow
was
drifting
along
under
bare
poles
and
dick
lee
and
ford
were
waiting
the
orders
to
let
go
the
neat
little
anchor
heave
over
went
the
iron
the
hawser
followed
briskly
that
do
dick
hold
her
dick
gave
the
rope
a
skilful
turn
around
its
pin
and
dab
shouted
now
for
some
it
about
three
fathoms
and
the
tide
near
the
turn
alas
for
the
uncertainty
of
human
calculations
the
grapnel
caught
on
the
bottom
surely
and
firmly
but
the
moment
there
came
any
strain
on
the
seemingly
stout
hawser
that
held
it
the
latter
parted
like
a
thread
and
the
swallow
was
all
adrift
somebody
done
gone
cut
dat
rope
shouted
dick
as
he
frantically
pulled
in
the
treacherous
bit
of
hemp
there
was
an
anxious
look
on
dab
kinzer
face
for
a
moment
then
he
shouted
sharp
now
boys
or
we
be
rolling
in
the
surf
in
three
minutes
haul
away
dick
haul
with
him
ford
up
with
her
there
that
give
us
headway
ford
foster
looked
out
to
seaward
even
while
he
was
hauling
his
best
upon
the
sail
halyards
all
along
the
line
of
the
coast
at
distances
varying
from
a
hundred
yards
or
so
to
nearly
a
mile
there
was
an
irregular
line
of
foaming
breakers
an
awful
thing
for
a
boat
like
the
swallow
to
run
into
perhaps
but
ten
times
worse
for
a
larger
craft
for
the
latter
would
be
shattered
on
the
shoals
where
the
bit
of
a
yacht
would
find
plenty
of
water
under
her
that
is
if
she
did
not
at
the
same
time
find
too
much
water
her
ca
we
go
back
through
the
inlet
in
the
bar
asked
ford
not
with
this
wind
in
our
teeth
and
it
getting
worse
every
minute
no
more
will
it
do
to
try
to
keep
inside
the
surf
what
can
we
do
then
take
the
smoothest
places
we
can
find
and
run
the
sea
is
very
rough
outside
it
our
only
chance
poor
ford
foster
heart
sank
within
him
as
he
listened
and
as
he
gazed
ahead
upon
the
long
white
line
of
foaming
surf
and
tossing
breakers
he
saw
however
a
look
of
heroic
resolution
rising
in
captain
kinzer
face
and
it
gave
him
courage
to
turn
his
eyes
again
towards
the
surf
the
swallow
was
now
once
more
moving
in
a
way
to
justify
her
name
and
although
ford
was
no
sailor
he
could
see
that
her
only
chance
to
penetrate
that
perilous
barrier
of
broken
water
was
to
take
it
nose
on
as
dick
lee
expressed
it
that
was
clearly
the
thing
dab
kinzer
intended
to
do
there
were
places
of
comparative
smoothness
here
and
there
in
the
tossing
and
plunging
line
but
they
were
bad
enough
at
the
best
and
they
would
have
been
a
good
deal
worse
but
for
that
stiff
breeze
blowing
off
shore
now
for
it
shouted
dab
as
the
swallow
bounded
on
dar
dey
come
said
dick
ford
thought
of
his
mother
and
sister
and
father
but
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
and
hardly
felt
like
breathing
bows
foremost
full
sail
rising
like
a
cork
on
the
long
strong
billows
which
would
have
rolled
her
over
and
over
if
she
had
not
been
handled
so
skilfully
as
she
really
was
once
or
twice
pitching
dangerously
in
short
chopping
seas
and
shipping
water
enough
to
wet
her
brave
young
mariners
to
the
skin
and
call
for
vigorous
baling
afterwards
the
swallow
battled
gallantly
with
her
danger
for
a
few
moments
and
then
dab
kinzer
swung
his
hat
and
shouted
hurrah
boys
we
out
at
sea
dat
so
said
dick
so
it
is
remarked
ford
a
little
gloomily
but
how
on
earth
will
we
ever
get
ashore
again
we
ca
go
back
through
that
surf
well
replied
dab
if
it
does
come
on
to
blow
too
hard
we
run
right
on
down
the
coast
if
the
wind
lulled
or
whopped
around
a
little
we
find
our
way
in
easy
enough
long
before
night
we
might
have
a
tough
time
beating
home
across
the
bay
even
if
we
were
inside
the
bar
now
anyhow
we
safe
enough
out
here
ford
could
hardly
feel
that
very
strongly
but
he
was
determined
not
to
let
dab
see
it
and
he
made
an
effort
at
the
calmness
of
a
mohawk
as
he
said
how
about
fishing
guess
we
wo
bother
much
but
you
might
go
for
a
bluefish
sometimes
they
have
great
luck
with
them
right
along
here
chapter
xi
splendid
fishing
and
a
big
fog
there
is
no
telling
how
many
anxious
people
there
may
have
been
in
that
region
that
night
a
little
after
supper
but
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
state
of
mind
in
at
least
three
family
circles
good
foster
could
not
endure
to
stay
at
home
and
talk
about
the
matter
and
her
husband
and
annie
were
very
willing
to
go
over
to
the
kinzers
with
her
and
listen
to
the
encouraging
views
of
and
sensible
mother
they
were
welcomed
heartily
and
the
conversation
began
so
to
speak
right
in
the
middle
oh
kinzer
do
you
think
they
are
in
any
danger
i
hope
not
i
do
see
why
there
need
be
unless
they
try
to
return
across
the
bay
against
this
wind
but
do
you
think
they
try
do
you
mean
they
wo
be
home
exclaimed
foster
himself
i
sincerely
hope
not
said
the
widow
calmly
i
should
hardly
feel
like
trusting
dabney
out
in
the
boat
again
if
he
should
do
so
foolish
a
thing
but
where
can
he
stay
at
anchor
somewhere
or
on
the
island
almost
anywhere
but
tacking
all
night
on
the
bay
he
be
really
safer
out
at
sea
than
trying
to
get
home
out
at
sea
there
was
something
really
dreadful
in
the
very
idea
of
it
and
annie
foster
turned
pale
enough
when
she
thought
of
the
gay
little
yacht
and
her
brother
out
on
the
broad
atlantic
in
it
with
no
better
crew
than
dab
kinzer
and
dick
lee
samantha
and
her
sisters
were
hardly
as
steady
about
it
as
their
mother
but
they
were
careful
to
conceal
their
misgivings
from
their
neighbors
which
was
very
kindly
indeed
in
the
circumstances
there
was
little
use
in
trying
to
think
or
talk
of
any
thing
else
beside
the
boys
however
with
the
sound
of
the
high
wind
in
the
trees
out
by
the
roadside
and
a
very
anxious
circle
was
that
up
to
the
late
hour
at
which
the
members
of
it
separated
for
the
night
but
there
were
other
troubled
hearts
in
that
vicinity
old
bill
lee
himself
had
been
out
fishing
all
day
with
very
poor
luck
but
he
forgot
all
about
that
when
he
learned
on
reaching
the
shore
that
dick
and
his
white
friends
had
not
returned
he
even
pulled
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
inlet
to
see
if
the
gathering
darkness
would
give
him
any
signs
of
his
boy
he
did
not
know
it
but
while
he
was
gone
dick
mother
after
discussing
her
anxieties
with
some
of
her
neighbors
half
weepingly
unlocked
her
one
and
took
out
the
suit
which
had
been
the
pride
of
her
absent
son
she
had
never
admired
them
half
so
much
before
but
they
seemed
now
to
need
a
red
necktie
to
set
them
off
and
so
the
gorgeous
result
of
dick
fishing
and
trading
came
out
of
its
and
was
arranged
on
the
white
coverlet
of
her
own
bed
with
the
rest
of
his
best
garments
jus
de
for
a
handsome
young
feller
like
dick
she
muttered
to
herself
wot
for
an
ole
woman
like
me
want
to
put
on
any
sech
fool
finery
he
de
bestest
boy
in
de
worl
he
is
dat
is
onless
dar
ai
happened
to
her
husband
brought
her
home
no
news
when
he
came
and
dick
good
qualities
were
likely
to
be
seen
in
a
strong
light
for
a
while
longer
but
if
the
folk
on
shore
were
uneasy
about
the
swallow
and
her
crew
how
was
it
with
the
latter
themselves
as
the
darkness
closed
around
them
out
there
upon
the
tossing
water
very
cool
and
indeed
had
been
captain
dab
kinzer
and
he
had
encouraged
the
others
to
go
on
with
their
even
when
it
was
pretty
tough
work
to
keep
the
swallow
from
scudding
at
once
before
the
wind
he
was
anxious
also
not
to
get
too
far
from
shore
for
there
was
no
telling
what
sort
of
weather
might
be
coming
it
was
curious
moreover
what
very
remarkable
luck
they
had
or
rather
ford
and
dick
for
dab
would
not
leave
the
tiller
for
a
moment
splendid
fellows
were
those
and
hard
work
it
was
to
pull
in
the
heaviest
of
them
that
was
just
the
sort
of
weather
they
bite
best
in
but
it
is
not
often
that
such
young
fishermen
venture
to
take
advantage
of
it
no
nor
the
old
ones
either
for
only
the
stanchest
old
salts
of
montauk
or
new
london
would
have
felt
altogether
at
home
in
the
swallow
that
afternoon
i
guess
i
would
fish
any
more
said
dab
at
last
you
caught
ten
times
as
many
now
as
we
ever
thought
of
catching
some
of
them
are
whoppers
too
biggest
fishing
ever
i
did
said
ford
as
if
that
meant
a
great
deal
or
mos
anybody
else
out
dis
yer
way
added
dick
i
is
to
show
dem
fish
anywhar
no
more
i
ai
said
dab
but
you
getting
too
tired
and
so
am
i
we
must
have
a
good
hearty
lunch
and
put
swallow
before
the
wind
for
a
while
i
dare
risk
any
more
of
these
cross
seas
we
might
get
pitched
over
any
minute
they
rising
dat
so
said
dick
and
i
awful
hungry
i
is
the
swallow
was
well
enough
provisioned
for
a
short
cruise
not
to
mention
the
bluefish
and
there
was
water
enough
on
board
for
several
days
if
they
should
happen
to
need
it
but
there
was
little
danger
of
that
unless
the
wind
should
continue
to
be
altogether
against
them
it
was
blowing
hard
when
the
boys
finished
their
dinner
but
no
harder
than
it
had
already
blown
several
times
that
day
and
the
swallow
seemed
to
be
putting
forth
her
very
best
qualities
as
a
there
was
no
immediate
danger
apparently
but
there
was
one
symptom
which
dab
discerned
as
he
glanced
around
the
horizon
which
gave
him
more
anxiety
than
either
the
stiff
breeze
or
the
rough
sea
the
coming
darkness
no
for
stars
and
lighthouses
can
be
seen
at
night
and
steering
by
them
is
easy
enough
nights
are
pretty
dark
things
sometimes
as
most
people
know
but
the
darkest
thing
to
be
met
with
at
sea
whether
by
night
or
by
day
is
a
and
dabney
saw
signs
of
one
coming
rain
too
might
come
with
it
but
that
would
be
of
small
account
boys
he
said
do
you
know
we
out
of
sight
of
land
oh
no
we
not
replied
ford
confidently
look
yonder
that
is
land
ford
that
only
a
and
we
shall
be
all
in
the
dark
in
ten
minutes
the
wind
is
changing
too
and
i
hardly
know
where
we
are
look
at
your
compass
that
tells
me
the
wind
is
changing
a
little
and
it
going
down
but
i
would
dare
to
run
towards
the
shore
in
a
fog
and
at
night
why
not
why
do
you
remember
those
breakers
would
you
like
to
be
blown
through
them
and
not
see
where
you
were
going
well
no
said

i
rather
guess
i
would
jes
you
let

crustily

if

ford
respect
for
dabney
kinzer
was
growing
hourly
here
was
this
overgrown
gawk
of
a
green
country
boy
just
out
of
his
roundabouts
who
had
never
spent
more
than
a
day
at
a
time
in
the
great
city
and
never
lived
in
any
kind
of
a
in
fact
here
was
a
fellow
who
had
had
no
advantages
whatever
coming
out
as
a
sort
of
hero
ford
looked
at
him
hard
as
he
stood
there
with
the
tiller
in
his
hand
but
he
could
not
quite
understand
it
dab
was
so
quiet
and
about
it
all
and
as
for
that
youngster
himself
he
had
no
idea
that
he
was
behaving
any
better
than
any
other
boy
could
should
and
would
have
behaved
in
those
very
peculiar
circumstances
however
that
might
be
the
gay
and
buoyant
little
swallow
with
her
signal
lantern
swinging
at
her
was
soon
dancing
away
through
the
deepening
darkness
and
the
fog
and
her
young
commander
was
congratulating
himself
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
less
of
wind
and
sea
even
if
there
was
more
of
mist
i
could
expect
to
have
every
thing
to
suit
me
he
said
to
himself
and
now
i
hope
we
run
down
anybody

red
light
through
the
fog
yonder
chapter
xii
how
the
game
of
follow
my
leader
can
be
played
at
sea
there
was
yet
another
gathering
of
human
beings
on
the
surface
of
the
atlantic
that
evening
to
whose
minds
the
minutes
and
hours
were
going
by
with
no
small
burden
of
anxiety
to
carry
not
an
anxiety
perhaps
as
great
as
that
of
the
three
families
over
there
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
or
even
of
the
three
boys
tossing
along
through
the
fog
in
their
bubble
of
a
yacht
but
the
officers
and
not
a
few
of
the
passengers
and
crew
of
the
great
were
any
thing
but
easy
about
the
way
their
affairs
were
looking
it
would
have
been
so
much
more
agreeable
if
they
could
have
looked
at
them
at
all
had
they
no
pilot
on
board
to
be
sure
they
had
for
he
had
come
on
board
in
the
usual
way
as
they
drew
near
their
intended
port
but
they
had
somehow
seemed
to
bring
that
fog
along
with
them
and
the
captain
had
a
suspicion
that
neither
the
pilot
nor
he
himself
knew
exactly
where
they
now
were
that
is
a
bad
condition
for
a
great
ship
to
be
in
at
any
time
and
especially
when
it
was
drawing
so
near
a
coast
which
calls
for
good
seamanship
and
skilful
pilotage
in
the
best
of
weather
the
captain
would
not
for
any
thing
have
confessed
his
doubt
to
the
pilot
nor
the
pilot
his
to
the
captain
and
that
was
where
the
real
danger
lay
after
all
if
they
could
only
have
choked
down
their
pride
and
permitted
themselves
to
talk
of
their
possible
peril
it
would
very
likely
have
disappeared
that
is
they
could
at
least
have
decided
to
stop
the
vessel
till
they
were
rid
of
their
doubt
the
steamer
was
french
and
her
captain
a
french
naval
officer
and
it
is
possible
he
and
the
pilot
did
not
understand
each
other
any
too
well
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
the
speed
of
the
ship
should
be
somewhat
lessened
under
such
circumstances
but
it
would
have
been
a
good
deal
wiser
not
to
have
gone
on
at
all
not
to
speak
of
the
shore
they
were
nearing
they
might
be
sure
they
were
not
the
only
craft
steaming
or
sailing
over
those
busy
waters
and
vessels
have
sometimes
been
known
to
run
against
one
another
in
a
fog
as
thick
as
that
something
could
be
done
by
way
of
precaution
in
that
direction
and
lanterns
with
bright
colors
were
freely
swung
out
but
the
fog
was
likely
to
diminish
their
usefulness
somewhat
they
took
away
a
little
of
the
gloom
but
none
of
the
passengers
were
in
a
mood
to
go
to
bed
with
the
end
of
their
voyage
so
near
and
they
all
seemed
disposed
to
discuss
the
fog
if
not
the
general
question
of
mists
and
their
discomforts
all
of
them
but
one
and
he
a
boy
a
boy
of
about
dab
kinzer
age
slender
and
with
curly
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
complexion
which
would
have
been
fair
but
for
the
traces
it
bore
of
a
hotter
climate
than
that
of
either
france
or
america
he
seemed
to
be
all
alone
and
to
be
feeling
very
lonely
that
night
and
he
was
leaning
over
the
rail
peering
out
into
the
mist
humming
to
himself
a
sweet
wild
air
in
a
strange
but
exceedingly
musical
tongue
very
strange
very
musical
perhaps
no
such
words
had
ever
before
gone
out
over
that
part
of
the
atlantic
for
frank
harley
was
a
missionary
son
going
home
to
be
educated
and
the
sweet
song
was
a
hindustanee
hymn
which
his
mother
had
taught
him
in
india
suddenly
the
hymn
was
cut
short
by
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
lookout
as
it
announced
a
white
light
close
aboard
on
the
windward
bow
that
was
rapidly
followed
by
even
hoarser
hails
replied
to
by
a
voice
which
was
clear
and
strong
enough
but
not
hoarse
at
all
the
next
moment
something
which
was
either
a
white
sail
or
a
ghost
came
slipping
along
through
the
fog
and
then
the
conversation
did
not
require
to
be
shouted
any
longer
frank
could
even
hear
one
person
say
to
another
out
there
in
the
mist
ai
it
a
big
thing
ford
that
you
know
french
i
mean
to
study
it
when
we
get
home
it
as
easy
as
eating
dab
shall
i
tell
we
got
some
fish
of
course
we
sell
the
whole
cargo
sell
them
why
not
make
them
a
present
we
may
need
the
money
to
get
home
with
they
a
splendid
lot
enough
for
the
whole
dat
a
fack
dab
kinzer
de
sort
ob
fo
me
he
is
how
much
then
dollars
for
the
lot
they
worth
it
specially
if
we
lose
ham
boat
dab
philosophy
was
a
little
out
of
gear
but
a
perfect
rattle
of
questions
and
answers
followed
in
french
and
somewhat
to
frank
harley
astonishment
the
bargain
was
promptly
concluded
fresh
fish
just
out
of
the
water
were
a
particularly
pleasant
arrival
to
people
who
had
been
ten
days
out
at
sea
how
were
they
to
get
them
on
board
nothing
easier
since
the
little
swallow
could
run
along
so
nicely
under
the
stern
of
the
great
steamer
after
a
line
was
thrown
her
and
a
large
basket
was
swung
out
at
the
end
of
a
long
slender
spar
with
a
pulley
to
lower
and
raise
it
there
was
fun
in
the
loading
of
that
basket
but
even
the
boys
from
long
island
were
astonished
at
the
number
and
size
of
the
fine
to
which
they
were
treating
the
hungry
passengers
of
the
prudhomme
and
the
basket
had
to
go
and
come
again
and
again
the
steamer
steward
on
his
part
avowed
that
he
had
never
before
met
so
honest
a
lot
of
yankee
fishermen
perhaps
not
for
high
prices
and
short
weight
are
apt
to
go
together
where
luxuries
are
selling
the
pay
itself
was
handed
out
in
the
same
basket
which
went
for
the
fish
and
then
the
swallow
was
again
cast
loose
the
wind
was
not
nearly
so
high
as
it
had
been
and
the
sea
had
for
some
time
been
going
down
twenty
minutes
later
frank
harley
heard
for
he
understood
french
very
well
hullo
the
boat
what
are
you
following
us
for
oh
we
wo
run
you
down
do
be
alarmed
we
lost
our
way
out
here
and
we
going
to
follow
you
in
hope
you
know
where
you
are
there
was
a
cackle
of
surprise
and
laughter
among
the
officers
in
which
frank
and
some
of
the
passengers
joined
and
the
saucy
little
came
steadily
on
in
the
wake
of
her
gigantic
tide
this
is
grand
for
us
remarked
dab
kinzer
to
ford
as
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
of
the
prudhomme
they
pay
all
our
but
they
going
to
new
york
so
are
we
if
does
come
out
clear
and
with
a
good
wind
to
go
home
by
it
better
than
crossing
the
atlantic
in
the
dark
anyhow
but
what
a
steep
price
we
got
for
those
fish
they
always
ready
to
pay
well
for
such
things
at
the
end
of
a
voyage
said
dab
i
expected
though
they
try
and
beat
us
down
a
peg
they
generally
do
we
did
get
much
more
than
the
fair
market
price
after
all
only
we
got
rid
of
our
whole
catch
at
one
sale
that
was
a
good
deal
better
than
fishermen
are
apt
to
do
hour
followed
hour
and
the
swallow
followed
the
steamer
and
the
fog
followed
them
both
so
closely
that
sometimes
even
dick
lee
keen
eyes
could
with
difficulty
make
out
the
prudhomme
light
and
now
ford
foster
ventured
to
take
a
bit
of
a
nap
so
sure
did
he
feel
that
all
the
danger
was
over
and
that
captain
kinzer
was
equal
to
what
dick
lee
called
the
nagivation
of
that
yacht
how
long
he
had
slept
he
could
not
have
guessed
but
he
was
awakened
by
a
great
cry
from
out
the
mist
beyond
them
and
by
the
loud
exclamation
of
captain
kinzer
still
at
the
tiller
i
believe
she
run
ashore
it
was
a
loud
cry
indeed
and
there
was
good
reason
for
it
well
was
it
for
all
on
board
the
great
steamer
that
she
was
running
no
faster
at
the
time
and
that
there
was
no
hurricane
of
a
gale
to
make
things
worse
for
her
pilot
and
captain
had
both
together
missed
their
reckoning
neither
of
them
could
ever
afterward
tell
how
and
there
they
were
stuck
fast
in
the
sand
with
the
noise
of
breakers
ahead
of
them
and
the
dense
fog
all
around
frank
harley
peered
anxiously
over
the
rail
again
but
he
could
not
have
complained
that
he
was
wrecked
in
sight
of
shore
for
the
steamer
was
any
thing
but
a
wreck
as
yet
and
there
was
no
shore
in
sight
it
an
hour
to
sunrise
said
dab
to
ford
after
the
latter
had
managed
to
comprehend
the
situation
we
may
as
well
run
farther
in
and
see
what
we
can
see
it
must
have
been
aggravating
to
the
people
on
board
the
steamer
to
see
that
little
of
a
yacht
dancing
safely
along
over
the
shoal
on
which
their
leviathan
had
struck
and
to
hear
ford
foster
sing
out
if
we
known
you
meant
to
run
in
here
we
have
followed
some
other
pilot
they
in
no
danger
at
all
said
dab
if
their
own
boats
do
take
all
ashore
the
will
the
government
i
you
mean
yes
they
all
alongshore
here
everywhere
hark
there
goes
the
bang
away
it
sounds
a
good
deal
more
mad
than
scared
so
it
did
and
so
they
were
captain
pilot
passengers
and
all
captain
kinzer
found
that
he
could
safely
run
in
for
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
or
so
but
there
were
signs
of
surf
beyond
and
he
had
no
anchor
to
hold
on
by
his
only
course
was
to
tack
back
and
forth
as
carefully
as
possible
and
wait
for
daylight
as
the
french
sailors
were
doing
with
what
patience
they
could
command
in
less
than
half
an
hour
however
a
pair
of
long
graceful
manned
each
with
an
officer
and
eight
rowers
came
shooting
through
the
mist
in
response
to
the
repeated
summons
of
the
steamer
cannon
it
all
right
now
said
dab
i
knew
they
would
be
long
in
coming
let
find
out
where
we
are
that
was
easy
enough
the
steamer
had
gone
ashore
on
a
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
beach
and
a
short
distance
from
seabright
on
the
new
jersey
coast
and
there
was
no
probability
of
any
worse
harm
coming
to
her
than
the
delay
in
her
voyage
and
the
cost
of
pulling
her
out
from
the
sandy
bed
into
which
she
had
so
blindly
thrust
herself
the
passengers
would
most
likely
be
taken
ashore
with
their
baggage
and
sent
on
to
the
city
overland
in
fact
said
ford
foster
a
is
as
bad
for
a
steamer
as
a
pig
is
for
a
locomotive
the
train
you
were
wrecked
in
said
dab
was
running
fast
perhaps
the
pig
was
now
the
sandbar
was
standing
still
and
the
steamer
was
going
slow
my
what
a
crash
there
have
been
if
she
been
running
ten
or
twelve
knots
an
hour
with
a
heavy
sea
on
by
daylight
there
were
plenty
of
other
craft
around
including
yachts
and
from
long
branch
and
all
along
shore
and
the
long
island
boys
treated
the
occupants
of
these
as
if
they
had
sent
for
them
and
were
glad
to
see
them
seems
to
me
you
inclined
to
be
a
little
inquisitive
dab
said
ford
as
his
friend
peered
sharply
into
and
around
one
craft
after
another
but
just
then
dabney
sang
out
hullo
jersey
what
are
you
doing
with
two
grapnels
is
that
boat
of
yours
balky
mind
yer
eye
youngster
they
both
mine
i
reckon
you
might
sell
me
one
cheap
continued
dab
considering
how
you
got
give
you
ten
cents
for
the
big
one
ford
thought
he
understood
the
matter
now
and
he
said
nothing
but
the
jersey
wrecker
had
picked
up
both
of
those
anchors
one
time
and
another
and
had
no
sort
of
objection
to
talking
trade
ten
cents
let
you
have
it
for
fifty
dollars
is
it
gold
or
only
silver
gilt
pure
gold
my
boy
but
seem
it
you
i
let
you
have
it
for
ten
dollars
take
your
pay
in
clams
oh
hush
i
hai
no
time
to
gabble
mebbe

yer
wreck
if
you
reelly
want
that
there
wot
you
gim
me
five
dollars
gold
take
it
or
leave
it
said
dab
pulling
out
a
coin
from
the
money
he
had
received
for
his
bluefish
in
three
minutes
more
the
swallow
was
furnished
with
a
much
larger
and
better
anchor
than
the
one
she
had
lost
the
day
before
and
dick
lee
exclaimed
it
jes
takes
kinzer
for
some
minutes
before
this
as
the
light
grew
clearer
and
the
fog
lifted
a
little
frank
harley
had
been
watching
them
from
the
rail
of
the
prudhomme
and
wondering
if
all
the
in
america
dressed
as
well
as
these
two
hullo
you
was
the
greeting
which
now
came
to
his
ears
go
ashore
in
my
boat
not
till
i
eaten
some
of
your
fish
for
breakfast
said
frank
what
your
name
captain
dabney
kinzer
of
anywhere
on
long
island
what
yours
frank
harley
of
rangoon
i
declare
almost
shouted
ford
foster
if
you
not
the
chap
my
sister
annie
told
me
of
you
going
to
albany
to
my
uncle
joe
hart
ai
you
yes
to
hart
and
then
to
grantley
to
school
that
it
well
then
you
can
just
come
along
with
us
get
your
kit
out
of
your
we
can
send
over
to
the
city
after
the
rest
of
your
baggage
after
it
gets
in
along
with
you
where
to
my
father
house
instead
of
ashore
among
those
hotel
people
and
other
wreckers
the
captain
tell
you
it
all
right
frank
had
further
questions
to
ask
before
he
was
satisfied
as
to
whose
hands
he
was
about
to
fall
into
and
the
whole
arrangement
was
no
doubt
a
little
irregular
so
was
the
present
position
of
the
prudhomme
herself
however
and
all
landing
rules
were
a
trifle
out
of
joint
by
reason
of
that
circumstance
so
the
steamer
authorities
listened
to
frank
request
when
he
made
it
and
gruffly
granted
it
the
swallow
lay
quietly
at
her
new
anchor
while
her
passenger
to
be
was
completing
his
preparations
to
board
her
part
of
them
consisted
of
a
hearty
breakfast
fresh
bluefish
broiled
and
while
he
was
eating
it
the
crew
of
the
yacht
made
a
deep
hole
in
what
remained
of
their
own
supplies
nobody
who
had
seen
them
eat
would
have
suspected
that
their
long
night
at
sea
had
interfered
with
their
appetites
in
fact
each
of
them
remarked
to
the
others
that
it
had
not
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
we
make
a
good
run
said
dab
it
be
great
what
said
ford
in
some
astonishment
ai
you
going
to
new
york
at
all
what
for
i
thought
that
was
what
you
meant
to
do
shall
you
sail
right
straight
home
why
not
if
we
could
do
that
distance
at
night
and
in
a
storm
i
guess
we
can
in
a
day
of
such
splendid
weather
as
this
with
the
wind
just
right
too
chapter
xiii
home
again
here
we
are
the
wind
was
indeed
just
right
but
even
dab
forgot
for
the
moment
that
the
swallow
would
go
faster
and
farther
before
a
gale
than
she
was
likely
to
with
the
comparatively
mild
southerly
breeze
now
blowing
he
was
by
no
means
likely
to
get
home
by
as
for
danger
there
would
be
absolutely
none
unless
the
weather
should
again
become
stormy
and
there
was
no
probability
of
any
such
thing
at
that
season
and
so
after
he
had
eaten
his
breakfast
and
with
a
genuine
confidence
in
boys
frank
harley
came
on
board
the
swallow
as
a
passenger
the
anchor
was
lifted
and
the
gay
little
craft
spread
her
white
sails
and
slipped
lightly
away
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
stranded
steamer
they
have
her
out
of
that
in
a
week
said
ford
to
frank
my
father
know
just
what
to
do
about
your
baggage
and
so
forth
there
were
endless
questions
to
be
asked
and
answered
on
both
sides
but
at
last
dab
yawned
a
very
sleepy
yawn
and
said
ford
you
had
your
nap
wake
up
dick
there
and
let
him
take
his
turn
at
the
tiller
the
sea
as
smooth
as
a
lake
and
i
believe
i
go
to
sleep
for
an
hour
or
so
you
and
frank
can
keep
watch
while
dick
steers
he
a
good
steerer
whatever
dab
said
was
orders
now
on
board
the
swallow
and
only
reply
was
if
you
have
earned
a
good
nap
then
nobody
has
dick
too
responded
promptly
and
cheerfully
and
in
five
minutes
more
the
patient
and
skilful
young
captain
was
sleeping
like
a
top
look
at
him
said
ford
foster
to
frank
harley
i
do
know
what
made
of
he
been
at
that
tiller
for
hours
by
the
watch
in
all
sorts
of
weather
and
never
budged
they
do
make
that
kind
of
boy
in
india
replied
frank
he
de
bes
feller
you
ebber
seen
added
dick
lee
i
jes
proud
ob
him
i
is
smoothly
and
swiftly
and
safely
the
swallow
was
bearing
her
precious
cargo
across
the
summer
sea
but
the
morning
had
brought
no
comfort
to
the
two
homes
at
the
head
of
the
inlet
or
the
humble
cabin
in
the
village
old
bill
lee
was
out
in
the
best
boat
he
could
borrow
by
early
daylight
and
more
than
one
of
his
sympathizing
neighbors
followed
him
a
little
later
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
that
a
thorough
search
would
be
made
of
the
bay
and
the
island
and
so
foster
wisely
remained
at
home
to
comfort
his
wife
and
daughter
that
sort
of
boy
mourned
annie
is
always
getting
into
some
kind
of
mischief
annie
exclaimed
her
mother
indignantly
ford
is
a
good
boy
and
he
does
not
run
into
mischief
i
did
mean
ford
i
meant
that
dabney
kinzer
i
wish
we
never
seen
him
or
his
sailboat
either
annie
remarked
her
father
a
little
reprovingly
if
we
live
by
the
water
ford
go
out
on
it
and
he
had
better
do
so
in
good
company
wait
a
while
annie
was
silenced
but
it
was
only
too
clear
that
she
was
not
entirely
convinced
her
brother
absence
and
all
their
anxiety
were
positively
due
to
dab
kinzer
and
his
wicked
dangerous
little
yacht
and
he
must
be
to
blame
somehow
she
could
not
help
waiting
a
while
as
her
father
bade
her
but
her
eyes
already
told
that
she
had
been
doing
more
than
wait
summer
days
are
long
but
some
of
them
are
a
good
deal
longer
than
others
and
that
was
one
of
the
longest
any
of
those
people
had
ever
known
for
once
even
dinner
was
more
than
half
neglected
in
the
kinzer
family
circle
at
the
fosters
it
was
forgotten
almost
altogether
long
as
the
day
was
and
so
dreary
in
spite
of
all
the
bright
warm
sunshine
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
hours
would
not
hurry
and
the
wanderers
would
not
return
came
at
last
and
with
it
the
fosters
all
came
over
to
kinzer
again
to
take
tea
and
tell
her
of
several
fishermen
who
had
returned
from
the
bay
without
having
discovered
a
sign
of
the
swallow
or
its
crew
kinzer
talked
bravely
and
encouragingly
nevertheless
and
did
not
seem
to
abate
an
ounce
of
her
confidence
in
her
son
it
seemed
as
if
in
leaving
off
his
roundabouts
particularly
considering
the
way
in
which
he
had
left
them
off
dabney
must
have
suddenly
grown
a
great
many
sizes
in
his
mother
estimation
perhaps
too
that
was
because
he
had
not
left
them
off
any
too
soon
there
they
sat
around
the
the
two
mothers
and
all
the
rest
of
them
looking
gloomy
enough
while
over
there
in
her
bit
of
a
brown
house
in
the
village
sat
lee
in
very
much
the
same
frame
of
mind
trying
to
relieve
her
feelings
by
smoothing
imaginary
wrinkles
out
of
her
boy
best
clothes
and
planning
for
him
any
number
of
bright
red
neckties
if
he
would
only
come
back
to
wear
them
the
neighbors
were
becoming
more
than
a
little
interested
and
even
excited
about
the
matter
but
what
was
there
to
be
done
telegrams
had
been
sent
to
other
points
on
the
coast
and
all
the
fishermen
notified
it
was
really
one
of
those
puzzling
cases
where
even
the
most
neighborly
can
do
no
better
than
wait
a
while
still
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
people
of
all
sorts
including
bill
lee
lingering
around
the
landing
as
late
as
eight
that
evening
suddenly
one
of
them
exclaimed
there
a
light
coming
in
others
followed
with
there
a
boat
under
it
ham
boat
carried
a
light
i
bet
it
her
no
it
is
hold
on
and
see
there
was
not
long
to
hold
on
for
in
three
minutes
more
the
swallow
swept
gracefully
in
with
the
tide
and
the
voice
of
dab
kinzer
shouted
merrily
home
again
here
we
are
such
a
ringing
volley
of
cheers
answered
him
it
was
heard
and
understood
away
there
in
the
parlor
of
the
morris
house
and
brought
every
soul
of
that
anxious
circle
right
up
standing
must
be
it
dab
exclaimed
kinzer
o
mother
said
annie
is
ford
safe
they
would
cheer
like
that
my
dear
if
any
thing
had
happened
remarked
foster
but
in
spite
of
his
coolness
the
city
lawyer
forgot
to
put
his
hat
on
as
he
dashed
out
of
the
front
gate
and
down
the
road
towards
the
landing
then
came
one
of
those
times
that
it
takes
a
whole
orchestra
and
a
gallery
of
paintings
to
tell
any
thing
about
for
lee
as
well
as
her
husband
was
on
the
beach
and
within
a
minute
after
captain
kinzer
and
his
crew
had
landed
poor
dick
was
being
hugged
and
scolded
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
the
two
other
boys
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
perfect
tumult
of
embraces
and
cheers
frank
harley
turn
came
soon
moreover
for
ford
foster
found
his
balance
and
introduced
the
passenger
from
india
to
his
father
frank
harley
exclaimed
foster
i
heard
of
you
certainly
but
how
did
you
boys
i
do
understand
oh
father
it
all
right
we
took
frank
off
the
french
steamer
after
she
ran
ashore
ran
ashore
yes
down
the
jersey
coast
we
got
in
company
with
her
in
the
fog
after
the
storm
that
was
yesterday
evening
down
the
jersey
coast
do
you
mean
you
been
out
at
sea
yes
father
and
i
go
again
with
dab
kinzer
for
captain
do
you
know
father
he
never
left
the
rudder
of
swallow
from
the
moment
we
started
until
seven
this
morning
you
owe
him
your
lives
almost
shouted
foster
and
ford
added
emphatically
indeed
we
do
it
was
dab
own
mother
arms
that
had
been
around
him
from
the
instant
he
had
stepped
ashore
and
samantha
and
keziah
and
pamela
had
had
to
content
themselves
with
a
kiss
or
so
apiece
but
dear
good
foster
stopped
smoothing
ford
hair
and
forehead
just
then
and
came
and
gave
dab
a
right
motherly
hug
as
if
she
could
not
express
her
feelings
in
any
other
way
as
for
annie
foster
her
face
was
suspiciously
red
at
the
moment
but
she
walked
right
up
to
dab
after
her
mother
released
him
and
said
captain
kinzer
i
been
saying
dreadful
things
about
you
but
i
beg
pardon
i
be
entirely
satisfied
miss
foster
said
dabney
if
you
only
ask
somebody
to
get
us
something
to
eat
eat
exclaimed
kinzer
why
the
poor
fellows
of
course
hungry
kinzer
allers
does
know
jes
de
right
to
do
mumbled
dick
in
a
voice
and
his
mother
let
go
of
him
with
law
suz
so
dey
be
hungry
enough
they
all
were
indeed
and
the
moreover
was
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
the
further
particulars
of
their
wonderful
cruise
to
be
told
and
heard
dick
lee
was
led
home
in
triumph
to
a
capital
supper
of
his
own
and
as
soon
as
that
was
over
he
was
rigged
out
in
his
sunday
clothes
red
silk
necktie
and
all
and
invited
to
tell
the
story
of
his
adventures
to
a
roomful
of
admiring
neighbors
he
told
it
well
modestly
ascribing
every
thing
to
dab
kinzer
but
there
was
no
good
reason
in
any
thing
he
said
for
one
of
his
father
friends
to
inquire
next
morning
bill
lee
does
you
mean
for
to
say
as
dem
boys
run
down
de
french
steamah
in
dat
ar
boat
not
dat
not
zackly
ef
you
does
i
jes
want
to
say
i
been
down
at
her
and
she
ai
even
snubbed
her
bowsprit
chapter
xiv
a
great
many
things
getting
ready
to
come
the
newspapers
from
the
city
brought
full
accounts
of
the
stranding
of
the
prudhomme
and
of
the
safety
of
her
passengers
and
cargo
the
several
editors
seemed
to
differ
widely
in
their
opinions
relating
to
the
whole
affair
but
there
must
have
been
some
twist
in
the
mind
of
the
one
who
excused
everybody
on
the
ground
that
no
pilot
however
skilful
could
work
his
compass
correctly
in
so
dense
a
fog
as
that
none
of
them
had
any
thing
whatever
to
say
of
the
performances
of
the
swallow
the
yacht
had
been
every
bit
as
well
handled
as
the
great
steamship
but
then
she
had
reached
her
port
in
safety
and
she
was
such
a
little
thing
after
all
whatever
excitement
there
had
been
in
the
village
died
out
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
boys
were
safe
and
a
good
many
people
began
to
wonder
why
they
had
been
so
much
upset
about
it
anyhow
lee
herself
the
very
next
morning
so
far
recovered
her
peace
of
mind
as
to
wonder
wot
dab
kinzer
goin
to
do
wid
all
de
money
he
got
for
dem
bluefish
i
is
goin
to
ask
him
said
dick
he
as
for
dab
himself
he
did
an
immense
amount
of
useful
sleeping
that
first
night
but
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
he
shortly
made
a
discovery
and
the
other
boys
soon
made
another
dab
was
that
all
the
long
hours
of
daylight
and
darkness
while
he
held
the
tiller
of
the
swallow
he
had
been
thinking
as
well
as
steering
he
had
therefore
been
growing
very
fast
and
would
be
sure
to
show
it
sooner
or
later
ford
and
frank
found
that
dab
had
forgotten
nothing
he
had
said
about
learning
how
to
box
and
how
to
talk
french
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
to
them
about
another
important
thing
he
talked
enough
to
be
sure
but
a
great
original
idea
was
beginning
to
take
form
in
his
mind
and
he
was
not
quite
ready
yet
to
mention
it
to
any
one
i
guess
he
muttered
more
than
once
i
better
wait
till
ham
comes
home
and
talk
to
him
about
it
as
for
frank
harley
foster
had
readily
volunteered
to
visit
the
in
the
city
with
him
that
next
day
and
see
that
every
thing
necessary
was
done
with
reference
to
the
safe
delivery
of
his
baggage
at
the
same
time
of
course
foster
wrote
to
her
sister
hart
giving
a
full
account
of
all
that
had
happened
but
saying
that
she
meant
to
keep
frank
as
her
own
guest
for
a
while
if
hart
did
not
seriously
object
that
letter
made
something
of
a
sensation
in
the
hart
family
neither
hart
nor
her
husband
thought
of
making
any
objection
for
to
tell
the
truth
it
came
to
them
as
a
welcome
relief
it
just
the
best
arrangement
that
could
have
been
made
maria
all
around
said
he
write
at
once
and
tell
her
she
may
keep
him
as
long
as
she
pleases
that
was
very
well
for
them
but
the
boys
hardly
felt
the
same
way
about
it
they
had
been
planning
to
have
all
sorts
of
fun
with
that
young
missionary
in
their
own
house
he
was
as
fuz
expressed
it
to
be
put
through
a
regular
course
of
sprouts
and
take
the
hindu
all
out
of
him
never
mind
though
said
joe
after
the
letter
came
and
the
decision
of
their
parents
was
declared
we
serve
him
out
after
we
get
to
grantley
there
wo
be
anybody
to
interfere
with
the
fun
well
yes
replied
fuz
and
i
just
as
lief
not
see
too
much
of
him
before
that
he
wo
have
any
special
claim
on
us
neither
if
he
does
go
there
from
our
house
that
was
a
queer
sort
of
calculation
but
it
was
only
a
beginning
they
had
other
talks
on
the
same
subject
and
the
tone
of
them
all
had
in
it
a
promise
of
lively
times
at
grantley
for
the
friendless
young
stranger
from
india
others
however
were
thinking
of
the
future
as
well
as
themselves
and
joe
and
fuz
furnished
the
subject
for
more
than
one
animated
discussion
among
the
boys
down
there
by
the
long
island
shore
ford
foster
gave
his
two
friends
the
full
benefit
of
all
he
knew
concerning
his
cousins
it
a
good
thing
for
you
he
said
to
frank
that
the
steamer
go
ashore
anywhere
near
their
house
they
a
pair
of
born
young
wreckers
just
think
of
the
tricks
they
played
on
my
sister
annie
they
were
all
related
in
ford
most
graphic
style
with
comments
to
suit
from
his
audience
after
that
conversation
however
it
was
remarkable
what
good
attention
dab
kinzer
and
frank
harley
paid
to
their
it
even
exceeded
the
pluck
and
perseverance
with
which
dab
worked
at
his
french
and
ford
was
compelled
to
admit
to
him
in
particular
you
ought
to
have
a
teacher
somebody
you
kill
if
you
make
out
to
get
in
a
hit
on
him
you
too
long
in
the
reach
for
me
and
your
arms
are
too
hard
what
between
the
and
the
boat
there
could
be
no
question
but
what
frank
harley
had
landed
at
the
right
place
to
get
strong
in
there
was
plenty
of
fishing
bathing
riding
boating
boxing
if
they
had
worked
day
and
night
they
could
not
have
used
it
all
up
three
boys
together
can
find
so
much
more
to
do
than
one
can
all
alone
and
they
made
it
four
as
often
as
they
could
for
dick
lee
had
proved
himself
the
best
kind
of
company
frank
harley
experience
had
made
him
indifferent
to
the
mere
question
of
color
and
ford
foster
was
too
much
of
a
man
to
forget
that
long
night
of
gale
and
fog
and
danger
on
board
the
swallow
it
was
only
a
day
or
two
after
that
perilous
cruise
that
dab
kinzer
met
his
old
playmate
jenny
walters
just
in
the
edge
of
the
village
how
well
you
look
dabney
remarked
the
little
lady
drowning
must
agree
with
you
yes
said
dab
i
like
it
do
you
know
what
a
fuss
they
made
over
you
when
you
were
gone
i
they
nothing
else
to
do
jenny
said
dab
suddenly
holding
out
his
hand
you
must
quarrel
with
me
any
more
bill
lee
told
me
about
your
coming
down
to
the
landing
you
may
say
any
thing
to
me
you
want
to
jenny
colored
and
bit
her
lip
and
she
would
have
given
her
bonnet
to
know
if
bill
lee
had
told
dab
how
very
red
her
eyes
were
as
she
looked
down
the
inlet
for
some
sign
of
the
swallow
something
had
to
be
said
however
and
she
said
it
almost
spitefully
i
do
care
dabney
kinzer
it
did
seem
dreadful
to
think
of
you
three
boys
being
drowned
and
you
too
with
your
new
clothes
on
dab
she
a
right
girl
if
she
only
show
it
muttered
dab
as
jenny
tripped
away
but
she
is
a
bit
like
annie
foster
his
thoughts
must
have
been
on
something
else
than
his
acquaintances
nevertheless
for
his
next
words
were
how
i
do
wish
ham
morris
would
come
home
there
was
time
enough
for
that
and
ham
was
hardly
likely
to
be
in
a
hurry
the
days
were
well
employed
in
his
absence
and
as
they
went
by
the
morris
homestead
went
steadily
on
looking
less
and
less
like
its
old
self
and
more
and
more
like
a
house
made
for
people
to
live
and
be
happy
in
kinzer
and
her
daughters
had
now
settled
down
in
their
new
quarters
as
completely
as
if
they
had
never
known
any
others
and
it
seemed
to
dab
now
and
then
as
if
they
had
taken
almost
too
complete
possession
his
mother
had
her
room
of
course
and
a
big
one
it
was
there
could
be
no
objection
to
that
then
another
big
one
of
the
very
best
had
to
be
set
apart
and
fitted
up
for
ham
and
miranda
on
their
return
home
and
dab
had
taken
great
delight
in
doing
all
in
his
power
to
make
that
room
all
it
could
be
made
but
then
samantha
had
insisted
upon
having
a
separate
domain
and
keziah
and
pamela
had
imitated
their
elder
sister
to
a
fraction
the
had
to
be
provided
as
well
or
what
would
become
of
the
good
old
long
island
notions
of
hospitality
dab
said
nothing
while
the
partition
was
under
discussion
nor
for
a
while
afterwards
but
one
day
at
dinner
just
after
the
coming
of
a
letter
from
miranda
announcing
the
speedy
arrival
of
herself
and
her
husband
he
quietly
remarked
now
i
ca
sleep
in
ham
room
any
longer
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
out
on
the
roof
i
wo
sleep
in
the
garret
or
in
the
cellar
that
will
be
a
good
deal
as
morris
says
when
she
comes
calmly
responded
his
mother
as
miranda
says
said
dab
with
a
long
breath
miranda
gasped
samantha
and
her
sisters
in
chorus
yes
my
dears
certainly
said
their
mother
this
is
house
or
her
husband
not
mine
all
the
arrangements
i
have
made
are
only
temporary
she
and
ham
both
have
ideas
and
wills
of
their
own
i
only
done
the
best
i
could
for
the
time
being
the
girls
looked
at
one
another
in
blank
amazement
over
the
idea
of
kinzer
being
any
thing
less
than
the
mistress
of
any
house
she
might
happen
to
be
in
but
dabney
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
with
it
all
right
then
if
ham
and
miranda
are
to
settle
it
i
think
take
the
room
sam
has
now
you
need
take
away
your
books
sam
i
may
want
to
read
some
of
them
or
lend
them
to
annie
you
and
kezi
and
mele
had
better
take
that
upper
room
back
the
smell
of
the
paint
all
gone
now
and
there
three
kinds
of
carpet
on
the
floor
dabney
exclaimed
samantha
reproachfully
and
with
an
appealing
look
at
her
mother
who
however
said
nothing
on
either
side
and
was
a
woman
of
too
much
good
sense
to
take
any
other
view
of
the
matter
than
that
she
had
announced
things
were
again
all
running
on
smoothly
and
pleasantly
before
dinner
was
over
but
dab
ideas
of
how
the
house
should
be
divided
were
likely
to
result
in
some
changes
perhaps
not
precisely
the
ones
he
indicated
but
such
as
would
give
him
something
better
than
a
choice
between
the
garret
the
cellar
and
the
roof
at
all
events
only
three
days
would
now
intervene
before
the
arrival
of
the
two
travellers
and
any
thing
in
the
way
of
further
discussion
of
the
room
question
was
manifestly
out
of
order
every
thing
required
for
the
coming
reception
was
pushed
forward
by
kinzer
with
all
the
energy
she
could
bring
to
bear
and
dab
felt
called
upon
to
remark
to
pamela
is
it
wonderful
mele
how
many
things
she
finds
to
do
after
every
thing
done
the
widow
had
promised
her
that
his
house
should
be
ready
for
him
and
it
was
likely
to
be
a
good
deal
more
ready
than
either
he
or
his
wife
had
expected
chapter
xv
dabney
kinzer
to
the
rescue
one
of
the
most
troublesome
of
the
annoyances
which
come
nowadays
to
dwellers
in
the
country
within
easy
reach
of
any
great
city
is
the
bad
kind
of
strolling
beggar
known
as
the
tramp
he
is
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
and
he
goes
everywhere
asking
for
any
thing
he
wants
very
much
as
if
it
belonged
to
him
and
he
had
come
for
his
own
so
long
as
he
can
do
his
asking
of
a
woman
or
a
man
there
had
been
very
few
of
these
gentry
seen
in
that
vicinity
that
summer
for
a
wonder
and
those
who
had
made
their
appearance
had
been
reasonably
well
behaved
probably
because
there
had
been
so
many
men
around
as
a
general
thing
but
it
come
to
pass
on
the
very
day
in
which
ham
and
miranda
were
expected
to
arrive
by
the
last
of
the
evening
trains
just
as
dab
kinzer
was
turning
away
from
the
landing
where
he
had
been
for
a
look
at
the
swallow
and
to
make
sure
she
was
all
right
for
her
owner
eyes
that
a
very
disreputable
specimen
of
a
worthless
man
stopped
at
kinzer
to
beg
something
to
eat
and
then
sauntered
away
down
the
road
it
was
a
little
past
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
even
so
dirty
a
tramp
as
that
had
a
perfect
right
to
be
walking
along
then
and
there
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
salt
air
from
the
bay
were
as
much
his
as
anybody
and
so
was
the
water
in
the
bay
and
no
one
in
all
that
region
of
country
stood
more
in
need
of
plenty
of
water
than
he
the
vagabond
took
his
right
to
the
road
as
he
had
taken
his
other
right
to
beg
his
dinner
until
down
to
the
landing
he
was
met
by
an
opportunity
to
do
a
little
more
begging
give
a
poor
feller
suthin
he
impudently
drawled
as
he
stared
straight
into
the
sweet
fresh
face
of
annie
foster
annie
had
been
out
for
only
a
short
walk
but
she
happened
to
have
her
with
her
and
she
thoughtlessly
drew
it
out
meaning
to
give
the
scamp
a
trifle
if
only
to
get
rid
of
him
only
a
dime
miss
whined
the
tramp
as
he
shut
his
dirty
hand
over
annie
gift
come
now
make
it
a
dollar
my
beauty
i
call
it
all
square
for
a
dollar
the
whine
grew
louder
as
he
spoke
and
the
wheedling
grin
on
his
disgusting
face
changed
into
an
expression
so
menacing
that
annie
drew
back
with
a
shudder
and
was
about
returning
her
little
portemonnaie
to
her
pocket
no
you
do
honey
the
words
were
uttered
in
a
hoarse
and
husky
voice
and
were
accompanied
by
a
sudden
grip
of
poor
annie
arm
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
snatched
greedily
at
the
morocco
case
did
she
scream
how
could
she
help
it
or
what
else
could
she
have
done
under
the
circumstances
she
screamed
vigorously
whether
she
would
or
no
and
at
the
same
moment
dropped
her
in
the
grass
beside
the
path
so
that
it
momentarily
escaped
the
vagabond
clutches
shut
up
will
you
other
angry
and
evil
words
accompanied
by
more
than
one
vicious
threat
followed
thick
and
fast
as
annie
struggled
to
free
herself
while
her
assailant
peered
hungrily
around
after
the
missing
prize
it
is
not
at
all
likely
he
would
have
attempted
any
thing
so
bold
as
that
in
broad
daylight
if
he
had
not
been
drinking
too
freely
and
the
very
evil
spirit
which
had
prompted
him
to
his
rash
rascality
unfitted
him
for
its
immediate
consequences
these
latter
in
the
shape
of
dab
kinzer
and
the
lower
joint
of
a
stout
had
been
bounding
along
up
the
road
from
the
landing
at
a
tremendous
rate
for
nearly
half
a
minute
a
boy
of
fifteen
assailing
a
ruffian
why
not
age
hardly
counts
in
such
a
matter
and
then
it
is
not
every
boy
of
even
his
growth
that
could
have
brought
muscles
like
those
of
dab
kinzer
to
the
swing
he
gave
that
length
of
seasoned
ironwood
annie
saw
him
coming
but
her
assailant
did
not
until
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
do
any
thing
but
turn
and
receive
that
first
hit
in
front
instead
of
behind
it
would
have
knocked
over
almost
anybody
and
the
tramp
measured
his
length
on
the
ground
while
dabney
plied
the
rod
on
him
with
all
the
energy
he
was
master
of
oh
do
dabney
do
pleaded
annie
you
kill
him
i
would
want
to
do
that
said
dab
as
he
suspended
his
pounding
but
he
added
to
the
tramp
now
you
better
get
up
and
run
for
it
if
you
caught
around
here
again
it
be
the
worse
for
you
the
vagabond
staggered
to
his
feet
and
he
looked
savagely
enough
at
dab
but
the
latter
looked
so
very
ready
to
put
in
another
hit
with
that
terrible
cudgel
and
the
whole
situation
was
so
unpleasantly
suggestive
of
further
difficulty
that
the
youngster
advice
was
taken
without
a
word
that
is
if
a
shambling
kind
of
double
limp
can
be
described
as
a
run
for
it
here
it
is
i
found
my
said
annie
as
her
enemy
made
the
best
of
his
way
off
he
did
not
hurt
you
no
he
only
scared
me
except
that
i
suppose
my
arm
will
be
where
he
caught
hold
of
it
thank
you
ever
so
much
dabney
you
a
brave
boy
why
he
almost
twice
your
size
yes
but
the
butt
of
my
rod
is
twice
as
hard
as
his
head
said
dabney
i
was
almost
afraid
to
strike
him
with
it
i
might
have
broken
his
skull
you
did
even
break
your
rod
no
and
now
i
must
run
back
for
the
other
pieces
and
the
tip
i
dropped
them
in
the
road
please
dabney
see
me
home
first
said
annie
i
know
it
foolish
and
there
is
a
bit
of
danger
but
i
must
confess
to
being
a
good
deal
frightened
dab
kinzer
was
a
little
the
proudest
boy
on
long
island
as
he
walked
along
at
annie
side
in
compliance
with
her
request
he
went
no
farther
than
the
gate
to
be
sure
and
then
he
returned
for
the
rest
of
his
rod
but
before
he
got
back
with
it
keziah
kinzer
hurried
home
from
a
call
on
foster
bringing
a
tremendous
account
of
dab
heroism
and
then
his
own
pride
over
what
he
had
done
was
only
a
mere
drop
in
the
bucket
compared
to
that
of
his
mother
dabney
is
growing
wonderfully
she
remarked
to
samantha
he
be
a
man
before
any
of
us
know
it
if
dab
had
been
a
man
however
or
if
ham
morris
or
foster
had
been
at
home
the
matter
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
drop
there
that
tramp
ought
to
have
been
followed
arrested
and
shut
up
where
his
vicious
propensities
would
have
been
under
wholesome
restraint
for
a
while
as
it
was
after
hurrying
on
for
a
short
distance
and
making
sure
he
was
not
pursued
he
clambered
over
the
fence
and
sneaked
into
the
nearest
clump
of
bushes
from
this
safe
covert
he
watched
dab
kinzer
return
after
the
lighter
pieces
of
his
rod
and
then
he
even
dared
to
crouch
along
the
fence
and
see
which
house
his
young
conqueror
went
into
that
where
he
lives
is
it
he
muttered
with
a
scowl
of
the
most
ferocious
vengeance
well
they
have
some
fun
there
before
they
git
to
bed
or
i
know
the
reason
why
it
could
not
have
occurred
to
such
a
man
that
he
had
been
given
his
dinner
at
the
door
of
that
very
house
what
had
the
collection
of
his
rights
as
a
tramp
to
do
with
questions
of
gratitude
and
revenge
the
bushes
were
a
good
enough
for
the
time
and
he
crawled
back
to
them
with
the
air
and
manner
of
a
man
whose
mind
was
made
up
to
something
ford
and
frank
were
absent
in
the
city
that
day
with
foster
who
was
kindly
attending
to
some
affairs
of
frank
but
when
the
three
came
home
and
learned
what
had
happened
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
of
them
failed
most
completely
in
trying
to
express
his
boiling
indignation
they
were
all
on
the
point
of
running
over
to
the
morris
house
to
thank
dab
but
foster
interposed
i
do
think
i
would
will
do
as
well
and
you
know
expecting
and
morris
this
evening
it
was
harder
for
the
boys
to
give
it
up
than
for
foster
and
the
waiting
till
looked
a
little
dreary
they
were
lingering
near
the
north
fence
two
hours
later
with
a
faint
idea
of
catching
dab
even
though
they
knew
that
the
whole
kinzer
family
were
down
at
the
waiting
for
ham
and
miranda
there
was
a
good
deal
of
patience
to
be
exercised
by
them
also
for
that
was
provokingly
behind
time
and
there
was
waiting
to
be
done
accordingly
the
darkness
of
a
moonless
and
somewhat
cloudy
night
had
settled
over
the
village
and
its
surrounding
farms
long
before
the
belated
engine
puffed
its
way
in
front
of
the
just
at
that
moment
back
there
by
the
north
fence
ford
foster
exclaimed
what
that
smell
it
like
burning
hay
more
than
any
thing
else
replied
frank
where
can
it
come
from
i
like
to
know
we
have
had
a
light
out
at
our
barn
light
exclaimed
frank
just
look
yonder
why
it
that
old
barn
beyond
the
morris
and
kinzer
house
somebody
must
have
set
it
on
fire
hullo
i
thought
i
saw
a
man
running
come
on
frank
there
was
indeed
a
man
running
just
then
but
they
did
not
see
him
for
he
was
already
very
nearly
across
the
field
and
hidden
by
the
darkness
he
had
known
how
to
light
a
fire
that
would
smoulder
long
enough
for
him
to
get
away
he
was
not
running
as
well
nevertheless
as
he
might
have
done
before
he
came
under
the
operation
of
dab
kinzer
lower
joint
kinzer
did
her
best
to
prevent
any
thing
like
a
scene
at
the
when
ham
and
miranda
came
out
upon
the
platform
but
there
was
an
immense
amount
of
welcome
expressed
in
words
and
hugs
and
kisses
in
the
shortest
possible
space
of
time
there
was
no
lingering
on
the
platform
however
for
ham
and
his
wife
were
as
anxious
to
get
at
the
surprise
they
were
told
was
waiting
for
them
as
their
friends
were
to
have
them
come
to
it
before
they
were
half
way
home
the
growing
light
ahead
of
them
attracted
their
attention
and
then
they
began
to
hear
the
vigorous
shouts
of
fire
from
the
throats
of
the
two
boys
now
by
foster
himself
and
the
lawyer
voice
was
an
uncommonly
good
one
dabney
was
driving
the
ponies
and
they
had
to
go
pretty
fast
for
the
rest
of
that
short
run
surprise
exclaimed
ham
i
should
say
it
was
did
you
light
it
before
you
started
dabney
do
joke
hamilton
remarked
kinzer
it
may
be
a
very
serious
affair
for
all
of
us
but
i
ca
understand
how
in
all
the
world
that
barn
should
have
caught
fire
guess
it
was
set
said
dab
chapter
xvi
dab
kinzer
and
ham
morris
turn
into
a
the
morris
farm
as
has
been
said
was
a
pretty
large
one
and
the
same
tendency
on
the
part
of
its
owners
which
led
them
to
put
up
so
extensive
and
a
house
had
stimulated
them
from
time
to
time
to
make
the
most
liberal
provisions
for
the
storage
of
their
crops
barns
were
a
family
weakness
with
them
as
furniture
had
been
with
the
kinzers
the
first
barn
they
had
put
up
now
the
oldest
and
the
farthest
from
the
house
had
been
a
large
one
it
was
now
in
a
somewhat
dilapidated
condition
to
be
sure
and
was
bowed
a
little
northerly
by
the
weight
of
years
that
rested
on
it
but
it
had
still
some
hope
of
future
usefulness
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
tramp
and
his
box
of
matches
there
is
a
bit
of
use
in
trying
to
save
it
exclaimed
ham
as
they
were
whirled
in
through
the
gate
it
gone
but
ham
said
kinzer
we
can
save
the
other
barns
perhaps
look
at
the
cinders
falling
on
the
long
stable
if
we
could
keep
them
off
somehow
we
can
do
it
ham
exclaimed
dab
very
earnestly
mother
will
you
send
me
out
a
broom
and
a
rope
while
ham
and
i
set
up
the
ladder
you
the
boy
for
me
said
ham
i
guess
i
know
what
you
up
to
the
ladder
was
one
the
had
been
using
and
was
a
pretty
heavy
one
but
it
was
quickly
set
up
against
the
largest
and
most
valuable
of
the
barns
and
the
one
too
which
was
nearest
and
most
exposed
to
the
burning
building
and
its
flying
cinders
the
rope
was
on
hand
and
the
broom
by
the
time
the
ladder
was
in
position
ford
said
dab
you
and
frank
help
the
girls
bring
water
till
the
men
from
the
village
get
here
there
plenty
of
pails
but
every
one
of
our
hands
is
now
ham
i
ready
up
they
went
and
were
quickly
astride
of
the
ridge
of
the
roof
it
would
have
been
perilous
work
for
any
man
to
have
ventured
farther
unassisted
but
dab
tied
one
end
of
the
rope
firmly
around
his
waist
ham
tied
himself
to
the
other
and
then
dab
could
slip
down
the
steep
roof
in
any
direction
without
danger
of
slipping
off
to
the
ground
below
but
the
broom
it
was
as
useful
as
a
small
the
flying
cinders
of
burning
hay
or
wood
as
they
alighted
upon
the
shingles
of
the
roof
needed
to
be
swept
off
as
fast
as
they
fell
before
they
had
time
to
fulfil
their
errand
of
mischief
here
and
there
they
had
been
at
work
for
some
minutes
and
the
fresh
little
blazes
they
had
kindled
had
so
good
a
start
that
the
broom
alone
would
have
been
insufficient
and
there
the
pails
of
water
came
into
capital
play
ford
foster
had
never
shone
out
to
so
good
an
advantage
in
all
his
life
before
as
he
did
when
he
took
his
station
on
the
upper
rounds
of
that
ladder
and
risked
his
neck
to
hand
to
ham
it
was
hard
work
all
around
but
hardest
of
all
for
the
two
firemen
on
the
roof
now
and
then
the
strength
and
agility
of
ham
morris
were
put
to
pretty
severe
tests
as
dab
danced
around
under
the
scorching
heat
or
slipped
flat
upon
the
sloping
roof
it
was
well
for
ham
that
he
was
a
man
of
weight
and
substance
there
were
scores
and
scores
of
people
streaming
up
from
the
village
now
arriving
in
panting
squads
every
moment
and
kinzer
had
all
she
could
do
to
keep
them
from
rescuing
every
atom
of
her
furniture
out
of
the
house
and
piling
it
up
in
the
road
wait
please
she
said
to
them
very
calmly
if
ham
and
dab
save
the
long
barn
the
fire
wo
spread
any
farther
the
old
barn
wo
be
any
loss
to
speak
of
anyhow
fiercely
as
the
dry
old
barn
burned
it
used
itself
up
all
the
quicker
on
that
account
and
it
was
less
than
thirty
minutes
from
the
time
ham
and
dabney
got
at
work
before
roof
and
rafters
fell
in
and
the
worst
of
the
danger
was
over
the
men
and
boys
from
the
village
were
eager
enough
to
do
any
thing
that
now
remained
to
be
done
but
a
large
share
of
this
was
confined
to
standing
around
and
watching
the
bonfire
burn
down
to
a
harmless
heap
of
badly
smelling
ashes
as
soon
however
as
they
were
no
more
wanted
on
the
roof
the
two
volunteer
firemen
came
down
and
ham
morris
first
word
on
reaching
the
ground
was
dab
my
boy
how
you
grown
not
a
tenth
of
an
inch
in
mere
stature
and
yet
ham
was
entirely
correct
about
it
he
stared
at
dabney
for
a
moment
and
then
he
turned
and
stared
at
every
thing
else
there
was
plenty
of
light
just
then
moon
or
no
moon
and
ham
eyes
were
very
busy
for
a
full
minute
he
noted
rapidly
the
improvements
in
the
fences
sheds
barns
the
blinds
on
the
house
the
paint
a
host
of
small
things
that
had
changed
for
the
better
and
then
he
simply
said
come
on
dab
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
her
mother
and
sisters
had
already
given
miranda
a
hurried
look
at
what
they
had
done
but
ham
was
not
the
man
to
do
any
thing
in
haste
deliberately
and
silently
he
walked
from
room
to
room
and
from
cellar
to
garret
hardly
seeming
to
hear
the
frequent
comments
of
his
enthusiastic
young
wife
that
he
did
hear
all
that
had
been
said
around
him
as
he
went
however
was
at
last
made
manifest
for
he
said
dab
i
seen
all
the
other
rooms
where
yours
i
going
to
let
you
and
miranda
have
my
room
said
dab
i
think
i
shall
board
here
long
i
do
think
you
will
either
said
ham
emphatically
you
going
away
to
miranda
is
there
any
reason
why
dab
ca
have
the
room
up
stairs
with
the
that
room
had
been
samantha
choice
and
she
looked
at
dab
reproachfully
but
miranda
replied
no
indeed
not
if
you
wish
him
to
have
it
now
ham
said
dabney
i
not
big
enough
to
fit
that
room
give
me
one
nearer
my
size
that
a
little
loose
for
even
sam
and
she
take
any
tucks
in
it
samantha
look
changed
to
one
of
gratitude
and
she
did
not
notice
the
detested
nickname
well
then
said
ham
we
see
about
it
you
can
sleep
in
the
spare
chamber
mother
kinzer
i
could
say
enough
about
this
house
business
if
i
talked
all
night
it
must
have
cost
you
a
deal
of
money
i
could
have
dared
to
ask
it
i
guess
you
must
kiss
me
again
a
curious
thing
it
was
that
came
next
one
that
nobody
could
have
reckoned
on
kinzer
good
soul
had
set
her
heart
on
having
ham
and
miranda
house
ready
for
them
on
their
return
and
now
ham
seemed
to
be
so
pleased
about
it
she
actually
began
to
cry
she
said
too
i
so
sorry
about
the
barn
ham
only
laughed
in
his
quiet
way
as
he
kissed
his
portly
and
said
come
come
mother
kinzer
you
did
set
it
afire
ca
miranda
and
i
have
some
supper
dab
must
be
hungry
too
after
all
that
there
had
been
a
sharp
strain
on
the
nerves
of
all
of
them
that
day
and
evening
and
they
were
glad
enough
to
gather
around
the
while
all
that
was
now
left
of
the
old
barn
smouldered
peaceably
away
with
half
the
boys
in
the
village
on
guard
once
or
twice
ham
or
dab
went
out
to
see
that
all
was
dying
out
rightly
but
it
was
plain
that
all
the
danger
was
over
unless
a
high
wind
should
come
to
scatter
the
cinders
by
this
time
the
whole
village
had
heard
of
dab
adventure
with
the
tramp
and
had
at
once
connected
the
latter
with
the
fire
there
were
those
indeed
who
expressed
a
savage
wish
to
connect
him
with
it
bodily
and
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
had
done
his
running
away
promptly
and
had
hidden
himself
with
care
for
men
were
out
after
him
in
all
directions
on
foot
and
on
horseback
who
would
have
dreamed
of
so
dirty
a
vagabond
taking
to
the
water
he
a
splendid
fellow
anyway
odd
was
it
not
but
annie
foster
and
jenny
walters
were
half
a
mile
apart
when
they
both
said
that
very
thing
just
before
the
clock
in
the
village
church
hammered
out
the
news
that
it
was
ten
and
bedtime
they
were
not
either
of
them
speaking
of
the
tramp
it
was
long
after
that
however
before
the
lights
were
out
in
all
the
rooms
of
the
morris
mansion
chapter
xvii
dab
has
a
waking
dream
and
ham
gets
a
sniff
of
sleep
one
of
the
most
excellent
things
in
all
the
world
and
very
few
people
get
too
much
of
it
nowadays
as
for
dabney
kinzer
he
had
done
his
sleeping
as
regularly
and
faithfully
as
even
his
eating
up
to
the
very
night
after
ham
morris
came
home
to
find
the
old
barn
afire
there
had
been
a
few
a
very
few
exceptions
there
were
the
nights
when
he
was
expecting
to
go
before
daylight
and
waked
up
at
midnight
with
a
strong
conviction
that
he
was
late
about
starting
there
were
perhaps
a
dozen
of
eeling
expeditions
that
had
kept
him
out
late
enough
for
a
full
basket
and
a
proper
scolding
there
too
was
the
night
when
he
had
stood
so
steadily
by
the
tiller
of
the
swallow
while
she
danced
through
the
dark
across
the
rough
billows
of
the
atlantic
but
on
the
whole
dab
kinzer
had
been
a
good
sleeper
all
his
life
till
then
once
in
bed
and
there
had
been
for
him
an
end
of
all
wakefulness
on
that
particular
night
for
the
first
time
sleep
refused
to
come
late
as
was
the
hour
when
the
family
circle
broke
up
it
could
not
have
been
the
excitement
of
ham
and
miranda
return
he
would
have
gotten
over
that
by
this
time
no
more
could
it
have
been
the
fire
though
the
smell
of
smouldering
hay
came
in
pretty
strongly
at
times
through
the
windows
if
any
one
patch
of
that
great
roomy
bed
was
better
made
up
for
sleeping
than
the
rest
of
it
dab
would
surely
have
found
the
spot
for
he
tumbled
and
rolled
all
over
it
in
his
restlessness
some
fields
on
a
farm
will
grow
wheat
better
than
others
but
no
part
of
the
bed
seemed
to
grow
any
sleep
at
last
dab
got
wearily
up
and
took
a
chair
by
the
window
the
night
was
dark
but
the
stars
were
shining
and
every
now
and
then
the
wind
would
make
a
shovel
of
itself
and
toss
up
the
hot
ashes
the
fire
had
left
sending
a
dull
red
glare
around
on
the
house
and
barns
for
a
moment
and
flooding
all
the
neighborhood
with
a
stronger
smell
of
burnt
hay
if
you
going
to
burn
hay
soliloquized
dabney
it
wo
do
to
take
a
barn
for
a
stove
not
that
kind
of
a
barn
but
what
did
ham
morris
mean
by
saying
that
i
was
to
go
to
that
what
i
like
to
know
the
secret
was
out
he
had
kept
remarkably
still
for
him
all
the
evening
and
had
not
asked
a
question
but
if
his
brains
were
ever
to
work
over
his
books
as
they
had
over
ham
remark
his
future
chances
for
sound
sleep
were
all
gone
it
had
come
upon
him
so
suddenly
the
very
thing
he
thought
about
that
night
in
the
swallow
and
wished
for
and
dreamed
about
during
all
those
walks
and
talks
and
lessons
of
all
sorts
with
ford
foster
and
frank
harley
ever
since
they
came
in
from
that
memorable
cruise
it
was
a
wonderful
idea
and
dab
had
his
doubts
as
to
the
way
his
mother
would
take
to
it
when
it
should
be
brought
seriously
before
her
little
he
guessed
the
truth
ham
remark
had
gone
deep
into
other
ears
as
well
as
dabney
and
there
were
reasons
therefore
why
good
kinzer
was
sitting
by
the
window
of
her
own
room
at
that
very
moment
as
little
inclined
to
sleep
as
was
the
boy
she
was
thinking
of
so
proud
of
him
too
she
was
and
so
full
of
bright
motherly
thoughts
of
the
man
he
would
make
one
of
these
days
when
he
gets
his
growth
there
must
have
been
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
between
dab
and
his
mother
for
by
and
by
just
as
she
began
to
feel
drowsy
and
muttered
well
well
we
have
a
talk
about
it
dab
found
himself
nodding
against
the
and
slowly
rose
from
his
chair
remarking
guess
i
might
as
well
finish
that
dream
in
bed
if
i
tumbled
out
the
window
i
have
lit
among
miranda
they
got
their
thorns
all
out
at
this
time
o
night
it
was
necessary
for
them
both
to
sleep
hard
after
that
for
more
than
half
the
night
was
gone
and
they
were
to
be
up
early
so
indeed
they
were
but
what
surprised
kinzer
when
she
went
into
the
kitchen
was
to
find
miranda
there
before
her
you
here
my
dear
that
right
i
take
a
look
at
the
where
ham
out
among
the
stock
dab
just
gone
to
him
curious
things
people
will
do
at
times
miranda
had
put
down
the
on
the
range
there
was
not
a
single
one
of
the
farm
help
around
male
or
female
and
there
stood
the
blooming
young
bride
with
her
back
toward
her
mother
and
staring
out
through
the
open
door
and
then
kinzer
slipped
forward
and
put
her
arms
around
her
neck
well
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
for
those
two
women
to
stand
there
and
cry
but
it
seemed
to
do
them
good
and
miranda
remarked
at
last
as
she
kissed
her
mother
o
mother
it
is
all
so
good
and
beautiful
and
i
so
happy
and
then
they
both
laughed
in
a
subdued
and
quiet
way
and
miranda
picked
up
the
while
kinzer
walked
away
into
the
such
cream
as
there
seemed
to
be
on
all
the
pans
that
morning
as
for
ham
morris
his
first
visit
on
leaving
the
house
had
been
to
the
relics
of
the
old
barn
as
a
matter
of
course
not
much
of
a
loss
he
said
to
himself
but
it
might
have
been
but
for
dab
there
the
making
of
a
man
in
him
wonder
if
he
get
enough
to
eat
if
we
sent
him
up
yonder
on
the
whole
i
think
he
would
if
he
did
i
do
believe
it
would
be
his
fault
he
got
to
go
and
his
mother
agree
to
it
i
know
talk
about
if
one
of
worth
as
much
as
she
is
i
like
to
have
a
dozen
do
know
that
though
i
afraid
the
rest
would
have
to
take
back
seats
as
long
as
kinzer
was
in
the
house
very
likely
ham
was
right
but
just
then
he
heard
the
voice
of
dab
behind
him
i
say
ham
when
you
looked
at
the
other
things
i
want
to
show
you
swallow
i
have
hurt
her
a
bit
and
her
new
grapnel
worth
three
of
the
old
one
all
right
dab
i
think
i
like
a
sniff
of
the
water
come
on
nothing
else
i
know
of
like
that
smell
of
the
shore
with
the
tide
half
out
no
more
there
is
and
there
have
been
men
many
of
them
who
had
wandered
away
into
the
interior
of
the
country
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
long
miles
and
settled
there
and
even
got
rich
and
old
there
and
yet
who
have
come
all
the
way
back
again
just
to
get
another
smell
of
the
salt
marshes
and
the
and
the
tide
ham
actually
took
a
little
boat
and
went
on
board
the
swallow
when
they
reached
the
landing
and
dab
kept
close
to
him
she
all
right
ham
but
what
are
you
casting
loose
for
dab
they
wo
all
be
ready
for
breakfast
in
two
hours
the
stock
and
things
can
go
the
men
tend
to
just
haul
on
that
sheet
a
bit
now
the
jib
look
out
for
the
boom
there
the
wind
a
little
ahead
but
it
is
bad
ah
the
last
word
came
out
in
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
was
followed
by
a
chuckle
which
seemed
to
gurgle
all
the
way
up
from
ham
boots
this
is
better
than
railroading
he
said
to
dabney
as
they
tacked
into
the
long
stretch
where
the
inlet
widened
toward
the
bay
no
pounding
or
jarring
here
talk
of
your
fashionable
why
dab
there
ai
any
thing
else
in
the
world
prettier
than
that
reach
of
water
and
the
with
the
ocean
beyond
it
there
some
ducks
and
some
gulls
why
dab
do
you
see
that
there
a
porpoise
inside
the
bar
it
was
as
clear
as
daylight
that
ham
morris
felt
himself
at
home
again
and
that
his
brief
experience
of
the
outside
world
had
by
no
means
lessened
his
affection
for
the
place
he
was
born
in
if
the
entire
truth
could
have
been
known
it
would
have
been
found
that
he
felt
his
heart
warm
toward
the
whole
coast
and
all
its
inhabitants
including
the
clams
and
yet
it
was
remarkable
how
many
of
the
latter
were
mere
empty
shells
when
ham
finished
his
breakfast
that
morning
he
preferred
them
roasted
and
his
had
not
forgotten
that
trait
in
his
character
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
the
sail
dabney
found
himself
on
the
point
of
saying
something
about
but
each
time
his
friend
broke
away
to
the
discussion
of
other
topics
such
as
porpoises
crabs
or
the
sailing
qualities
of
the
swallow
and
dab
dimly
felt
that
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
another
time
so
he
waited
it
was
a
grand
good
time
however
to
be
had
before
breakfast
and
as
they
again
sailed
up
the
inlet
very
happy
and
very
hungry
dab
suddenly
exclaimed
ham
do
you
see
that
how
could
they
have
guessed
where
we
gone
there
the
whole
kinzer
tribe
and
the
boys
are
with
them
and
annie
what
boys
and
annie
oh
ford
foster
and
frank
harley
annie
is
ford
sister
they
live
in
our
old
house
you
know
what
become
of
jenny
you
mean
my
boat
there
she
is
hitched
a
little
out
just
beyond
the
landing
there
was
nothing
on
dab
face
to
lead
any
one
to
suppose
that
he
guessed
the
meaning
of
the
quizzical
grin
on
ham
it
is
barely
possible
however
that
there
would
have
been
fewer
people
at
the
landing
if
ham
and
dab
had
not
been
keeping
a
whole
of
hungry
mortals
including
a
bride
waiting
breakfast
for
them
chapter
xviii
how
dab
worked
out
another
of
his
great
plans
there
was
a
sort
of
council
at
the
of
the
foster
family
that
morning
and
ford
and
annie
found
their
side
of
it
voted
down
that
was
not
at
all
because
they
did
not
debate
vigorously
and
even
protest
but
the
odds
were
too
much
against
them
annie
my
dear
said
foster
at
last
in
a
gentle
but
decided
way
i
sure
your
aunt
maria
if
not
your
uncle
must
feel
hurt
at
your
coming
away
so
suddenly
if
we
invite
joe
and
foster
to
visit
us
it
will
make
it
all
right
yes
sharply
exclaimed
foster
we
must
have
them
come
behave
themselves
here
i
write
to
their
father
you
write
to
maria
they
her
own
boys
you
know
added
foster
soothingly
well
mother
said
annie
if
it
must
be
but
i
sure
they
make
us
all
very
uncomfortable
if
they
come
i
can
stand
for
a
week
or
so
said
ford
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
can
do
or
bear
more
than
most
people
i
get
dab
kinzer
to
help
me
entertain
them
excellent
said
foster
and
i
hope
they
will
be
civil
to
him
to
dabney
asked
annie
fuz
and
joe
civil
to
dab
kinzer
exclaimed
ford
certainly
i
hope
so
father
said
ford
may
i
say
just
what
i
was
thinking
speak
it
right
out
well
i
was
thinking
what
a
good
time
fuz
and
joe
would
be
likely
to
have
trying
to
get
ahead
of
dab
kinzer
annie
looked
at
her
brother
and
nodded
and
there
was
a
bit
of
a
twinkle
in
the
eyes
of
the
lawyer
himself
but
he
only
remarked
well
you
must
be
neighborly
i
do
believe
the
hart
boys
know
much
about
the
seashore
dab
and
frank
and
i
will
try
and
educate
them
annie
thought
of
the
ink
and
her
box
of
spoiled
cuffs
and
collars
while
her
brother
was
speaking
could
it
be
that
ford
meant
a
good
deal
more
than
he
was
saying
at
all
events
she
fully
agreed
with
him
on
the
dab
kinzer
question
that
was
one
council
and
it
was
one
of
peace
or
war
probably
a
good
deal
as
the
hart
boys
themselves
might
thereafter
determine
at
the
same
hour
however
matters
of
even
greater
importance
were
coming
to
a
decision
around
the
in
the
morris
mansion
ham
had
given
a
pretty
full
account
of
his
visit
to
grantley
including
his
dinner
at
myers
and
all
he
had
learned
relating
to
the
academy
it
seems
like
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
began
kinzer
when
ham
at
last
paused
for
breath
but
lid
caught
her
up
at
once
with
i
know
you
been
paying
out
a
good
deal
mother
kinzer
but
dab
must
go
if
i
pay
you
pay
indeed
for
my
boy
i
like
to
see
myself
now
i
found
out
what
he
is
i
mean
he
shall
have
every
advantage
if
this
grantley
the
right
place
mother
exclaimed
samantha
it
the
very
place
foster
is
going
to
send
ford
to
and
frank
harley
exactly
said
ham
hart
spoke
of
a
foster
his
a
lawyer
why
said
keziah
he
living
in
our
old
house
now
ford
foster
is
dab
greatest
crony
they
the
very
people
you
met
at
the
landing
yes
i
heard
all
that
said
ham
but
somehow
i
had
put
the
two
things
together
now
mother
kinzer
do
you
really
mean
dab
is
to
go
of
course
i
do
said
she
well
if
that
is
doing
it
easy
do
you
know
it
about
the
nicest
thing
i
heard
since
i
got
here
except
the
barn
said
dabney
unable
to
hold
in
any
longer
mother
may
i
stand
on
my
head
a
while
you
need
all
the
head
you
got
said
ham
you
wo
have
much
time
to
get
ready
he
have
books
enough
after
he
gets
there
said
kinzer
decidedly
i
risk
dabney
and
they
make
him
give
up
all
his
slang
added
samantha
yes
sam
when
i
come
back
i
talk
nothing
but
greek
and
latin
getting
french
now
from
ford
and
hindu
from
frank
harley
then
i
know
english
and
slang
and
think
of
one
man
with
seven
languages
but
dabney
soon
found
himself
unable
to
sit
still
even
at
the
not
that
he
got
up
hungry
for
he
had
done
his
duty
by
miranda
cookery
but
the
house
itself
big
as
it
was
seemed
too
small
to
hold
him
with
all
his
new
prospects
swelling
within
him
perhaps
moreover
the
rest
of
the
family
felt
that
they
would
be
better
able
to
discuss
the
important
subject
before
them
after
dab
had
taken
himself
out
into
the
open
air
for
none
of
them
tried
to
stay
his
going
this
beats
dreaming
all
hollow
he
said
to
himself
as
he
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
half
way
down
to
the
gate
between
the
two
gardens
now
i
see
what
can
be
done
about
that
other
matter
two
plans
in
one
head
and
so
young
a
head
as
that
yes
and
it
spoke
well
for
dab
heart
as
well
as
his
brains
that
his
plan
number
two
was
not
a
selfish
one
the
substance
of
it
came
out
in
the
first
five
minutes
of
the
talk
he
had
a
trifle
later
with
ford
and
frank
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
ford
you
know
there
twenty
dollars
left
of
the
money
the
frenchman
paid
us
for
the
bluefish
well
what
of
it
is
it
yours
one
share
of
it
mine
the
rest
is
yours
and
dick
he
needs
it
more
i
do
ford
did
you
know
dick
lee
was
real
bright
little
chap
as
ever
i
saw
why
well
he
ought
to
go
to
school
why
do
he
go
he
does
except
in
summer
he
might
go
to
the
academy
if
they
take
him
and
if
he
had
money
enough
to
go
with
academy
what
academy
why
grantley
of
course
i
going
and
so
are
you
and
frank
why
should
dick
go
you
going
hurrah
for
that
why
did
you
say
so
before
was
sure
till
this
morning
you
fellows
be
a
long
way
ahead
of
me
though
but
i
mean
to
catch
up
for
a
few
minutes
poor
dick
was
lost
sight
of
in
a
perfect
storm
of
talk
but
dab
came
back
to
him
with
dick
folks
are
dreadful
poor
but
we
might
raise
it
twenty
dollars
to
begin
with
i
ten
dollars
saved
up
and
i
know
mother
say
it
right
in
exclaimed
ford
it
was
hardly
likely
foster
would
express
her
assent
in
precisely
that
way
but
frank
harley
promptly
added
i
think
i
can
promise
five
i
mean
to
speak
to
ham
morris
and
mother
about
it
said
dab
all
i
wanted
was
to
fix
it
about
the
twenty
dollars
to
start
on
frank
shouted
ford
let
go
right
in
and
see
our
crowd
ford
was
evidently
getting
a
little
excited
and
it
was
hardly
five
minutes
later
that
he
wound
up
his
story
in
the
house
with
father
may
i
contribute
my
ten
dollars
to
the
richard
lee
education
fund
of
course
but
he
will
need
a
good
deal
more
money
than
you
boys
can
raise
why
father
the
advertisement
says
half
a
year
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
he
can
board
for
less
than
we
can
perhaps
myers
would
let
him
work
out
a
part
of
it
i
can
spare
as
much
as
ford
can
here
put
in
annie
do
you
leave
me
out
entirely
said
her
mother
with
a
smile
that
was
even
sweeter
than
usual
as
for
lawyer
foster
himself
he
had
been
hemming
and
coughing
in
an
odd
sort
of
way
for
a
moment
and
he
had
said
i
declare
several
times
but
he
now
remarked
somewhat
more
to
the
purpose
i
do
believe
in
giving
any
man
a
better
education
than
he
will
ever
know
what
to
do
with
but
then
this
dick
lee
and
you
boys
well
see
what
you
can
do
but
no
one
must
be
allowed
to
contribute
outside
of
the
foster
and
kinzer
families
and
frank
as
for
the
rest
hem
ah
i
think
i
say
that
there
wo
be
any
difficulty
you
father
why
not
annie
do
you
i
going
to
let
myself
be
beaten
in
such
a
matter
by
a
mere
like
dabney
kinzer
father
said
ford
if
you
seen
how
dick
behaved
that
night
out
there
on
the
ocean
in
swallow
just
as
well
just
as
well
my
son
hurrah
shouted
ford
then
it
all
right
and
dick
lee
have
a
fair
shake
in
the
world
a
what
my
son
exclaimed
his
mother
i
did
mean
to
talk
slang
mother
i
only
meant
well
you
know
how
dreadfully
black
he
is
but
then
he
can
steer
a
boat
tiptop
and
splendid
for
crabs
and
bluefish
and
dab
says
he
a
good
scholar
too
dab
a
very
good
boy
said
foster
but
your
friend
dick
will
need
an
outfit
i
imagine
clothing
and
almost
every
thing
i
must
see
kinzer
about
it
meantime
dick
lee
part
in
the
matter
and
that
of
his
family
had
been
taken
for
granted
all
around
an
hour
later
however
first
reply
to
her
son
after
listening
to
a
calculation
of
his
which
almost
made
it
seem
as
if
dick
would
make
money
by
going
to
grantley
was
what
if
lee
should
say
she
ca
spare
him
dab
countenance
fell
he
knew
lee
but
he
had
not
thought
so
far
as
that
he
said
something
not
very
intelligible
but
to
that
effect
well
dabney
if
we
can
make
the
other
arrangements
i
see
her
about
it
ham
morris
had
been
exchanging
remarkable
winks
with
miranda
and
samantha
and
now
gravely
suggested
maybe
the
academy
authorities
will
refuse
to
take
him
ford
says
they
had
a
blacker
boy
than
he
is
there
last
year
now
dab
exclaimed
ham
well
i
know
he
pretty
black
but
it
do
come
off
mother
said
samantha
foster
and
annie
are
coming
through
the
gate
dab
waited
just
long
enough
after
that
to
learn
the
news
concerning
the
richard
lee
education
fund
and
foster
offer
and
then
he
was
off
towards
the
shore
he
knew
very
well
in
which
direction
it
was
best
to
go
and
half
way
to
the
landing
he
met
dick
coming
up
the
road
with
a
basket
of
eels
on
his
arm
dick
shouted
dabney
i
going
away
to
at
an
academy
whar
up
in
new
england
they
call
it
grantley
academy
where
frank
and
ford
are
going
dat
spiles
it
all
said
dick
ruefully
now
i
got
to
fish
wid
fellers

no
you
wo
you
going
with
us
it
all
fixed
money
and
all
dick
would
never
have
thought
ordinarily
of
questioning
a
statement
made
by
captain
kinzer
but
the
rueful
expression
deepened
on
his
face
the
basket
of
eels
dropped
heavily
on
the
grass
the
tough
black
fingers
of
his
hands
twisted
nervously
together
for
a
moment
and
then
he
sat
mournfully
down
beside
the
basket
it
ai
no
use
dab
no
use
why
not
i
ai
a
boy

of
it

my

and
frank
brought
a
fresh
gust
of
enthusiasm
with
them
and
they
had
dick
and
his
eels
up
from
the
grass
in
short
order
we
must
see
lee
right
away
said
ford
it
would
never
do
to
let
dick
tell
her
guess
dat
so
said
dick
quite
an
embassy
they
made
those
four
boys
with
dab
kinzer
for
spokesman
and
dick
lee
almost
crouching
behind
them
lee
listened
with
open
mouth
while
dab
unfolded
his
plan
but
when
he
had
finished
she
shut
her
lips
firmly
together
they
were
not
very
thin
and
not
at
all
used
to
being
shut
and
in
another
instant
they
opened
again
sho
de
boy

dat

i

so
dab
groaned
poor
dick
it
ai
no
use
i
wish
i
was
a
eel
dabney
was
on
the
point
of
opening
a
whole
broadside
of
eloquence
when
ford
foster
pinched
his
arm
and
whispered
your
mother
coming
and
our
annie
with
her
then
let
clear
out
she
worth
a
lot
full
of
us
come
on
boys
if
lee
was
surprised
by
their
very
sudden
and
somewhat
unceremonious
retreat
she
need
not
have
been
after
she
learned
the
cause
of
it
she
stood
in
wholesome
awe
of
kinzer
and
a
brush
with
the
portly
widow
by
the
sweet
face
of
annie
foster
was
a
pretty
serious
matter
she
did
not
hesitate
about
beginning
the
skirmish
however
for
her
tongue
was
already
a
bit
loosened
and
in
fine
wot
dis
yer
kinzer
sendin
away
my
dick
to
a
furrin
is
he
nigh
nuff
spiled
oh
it
all
arranged
nicely
miss
foster
and
i
only
came
over
to
see
what
we
could
do
about
getting
his
clothes
ready
he
must
have
things
warm
and
nice
for
the
winters
are
cold
up
there
i
has
said
he
might
go
dick
put
down
dem
eels
an
he
has
said
he
go
dick
take
off
yer
hat
an
his
father
now
glorianna
interrupted
kinzer
calling
dick
mother
by
her
first
name
i
known
you
these
forty
years
and
do
you
suppose
going
to
argue
about
it
just
tell
us
what
dick
need
and
do
have
any
nonsense
the
money
all
provided
how
do
you
know
become
of
him
he
may
be
governor
yet
he
mought
preach
that
idea
had
suddenly
dawned
upon
the
perplexed
mind
of
lee
and
dick
fate
was
settled
she
was
prouder
than
ever
of
her
boy
and
truth
to
tell
her
opposition
was
only
what
kinzer
had
considered
it
a
piece
of
unaccountable
nonsense
to
be
brushed
away
by
just
such
a
hand
as
the
widow
own
chapter
xix
a
grand
and
an
experiment
by
richard
lee
that
was
a
great
day
for
the
boys
but
before
the
close
of
it
ford
foster
had
told
his
friends
the
news
that
joe
hart
and
his
brother
fuz
had
been
invited
to
visit
with
him
will
they
come
asked
dab
certainly
that
kind
of
boy
always
comes
nobody
wants
to
keep
him
from
coming
when
do
you
look
for
them
right
away
vacation
almost
gone
you
know
wo
they
be
ashamed
to
meet
your
sister
not
a
bit
they
try
their
tricks
even
after
they
get
here
all
right
we
help
all
we
know
how
but
boys
i
tell
you
what
we
must
try
for
what
that
one
grand
good
in
swallow
before
they
get
here
hurrah
for
that
annie
was
wishing
for
one
only
yesterday
we
have
all
of
your
folks
and
all
of
ours
swallow
is
plenty
big
enough
mother
would
go
and
father
ca
just
now
he
trying
a
case
but
there
annie
and
frank
and
me
and
my
mother
and
ham
and
miranda
and
our
girls
ham
go
sure
then
we
must
take
dick
lee
along
it
make
him
sick
if
we
did
of
course
ai
i
glad
about
him
could
we
get
ready
and
go
guess
not
so
quick
as
that
we
might
by
the
day
after
if
the
all
right
exactly
there
is
always
a
if
to
be
put
in
where
any
thing
depends
on
the
weather
kinzer
took
the
matter
up
with
enthusiasm
and
so
did
the
girls
miranda
included
and
ford
foster
was
quite
right
about
his
part
of
the
company
but
the
weather
it
looked
well
enough
to
unpractised
eyes
but
ham
morris
shook
his
head
and
went
to
consult
his
fishermen
friends
there
was
a
good
deal
of
done
thereupon
for
every
human
barometer
among
them
advised
him
to
wait
a
day
or
so
and
hardly
any
two
of
them
gave
him
the
same
reason
for
doing
it
ford
foster
was
at
the
house
when
ham
made
his
report
and
was
a
little
surprised
to
see
how
promptly
dab
kinzer
yielded
his
assent
to
the
verdict
such
warm
nice
weather
as
this
is
he
remonstrated
and
there
any
wind
to
speak
of
there
too
much
of
it
coming
was
ham
response
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
after
that
not
even
when
the
mail
brought
word
from
aunt
maria
that
both
of
her
dear
boys
would
arrive
in
a
day
or
two
our
last
chance
is
gone
annie
said
ford
when
the
news
came
o
mother
she
said
despondingly
what
shall
we
do
have
your
sail
just
the
same
and
invite
your
cousins
but
the
kinzers
why
annie
kinzer
will
not
think
of
neglecting
them
she
as
kind
as
kind
can
be
and
we
are
to
pay
her
with
joe
and
fuz
said
ford
well
i
wish
ham
morris
storm
would
come
along
he
only
had
to
wait
until
the
next
day
for
it
and
he
felt
quite
contented
to
be
safe
on
shore
while
it
lasted
there
was
no
call
for
any
laughter
at
the
prophecies
of
the
fishermen
after
it
began
to
blow
still
the
blow
was
not
a
long
one
and
ham
morris
remarked
this
is
only
an
outside
edge
of
it
it
a
good
deal
worse
than
this
out
at
sea
i
glad
we
not
out
in
it
ford
foster
thought
that
about
the
worst
of
that
weather
was
when
the
afternoon
train
came
in
and
he
had
to
show
a
pair
of
tired
moist
and
altogether
unpleasant
cousins
to
the
room
set
apart
for
them
the
clouds
in
his
mind
did
not
clear
away
perceptibly
even
when
just
after
supper
a
note
came
in
from
kinzer
inviting
the
hart
boys
to
join
the
next
morning
the
storm
may
not
be
over
growled
ford
a
little
sulkily
oh
said
annie
kinzer
adds
that
the
weather
will
surely
be
fine
after
such
a
blow
and
the
bay
will
be
quite
safe
and
smooth
does
she
know
the
clerk
of
the
weather
asked
joe
hart
got
one
of
her
own
said
ford
joe
and
ford
both
found
something
to
laugh
at
in
that
but
they
said
nothing
they
were
both
feeling
a
little
strange
as
yet
and
were
almost
inclined
to
try
and
behave
themselves
the
main
difficulty
in
the
way
of
it
being
a
queer
idea
they
had
that
their
ordinary
way
of
doing
things
made
up
a
fair
article
of
good
behavior
nobody
had
taken
the
pains
to
bounce
them
out
of
the
notion
when
the
morning
really
came
sea
and
earth
and
sky
seemed
to
be
all
the
better
for
the
trial
they
had
been
through
and
the
weather
was
all
that
kinzer
had
prophesied
of
it
the
grass
and
trees
were
greener
and
the
bay
seemed
bluer
while
the
few
clouds
visible
were
very
white
and
clean
as
if
all
the
storms
had
been
recently
washed
out
of
them
there
was
no
question
now
to
be
raised
concerning
the
or
any
part
of
it
not
a
single
thing
went
wrong
in
management
of
the
setting
out
and
that
was
half
the
day
won
to
begin
with
ford
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
joe
and
fuz
out
of
bed
so
early
as
was
necessary
but
he
gave
them
an
intimation
which
proved
quite
sufficient
you
better
hop
boys
ham
morris
would
wait
five
minutes
for
the
queen
of
england
or
even
for
me
joe
whispered
fuz
a
little
while
after
they
got
on
board
the
yacht
are
we
to
be
gone
a
week
why
what
up
such
piles
of
provisions
as
they
stowed
away
in
that
kennel
the
bit
of
a
cabin
under
the
at
which
fuz
pointed
was
pretty
well
filled
beyond
a
doubt
but
kinzer
knew
what
she
was
about
she
had
provided
luncheon
for
most
of
that
party
before
and
the
effect
on
them
of
the
was
also
to
be
taken
into
account
dab
said
ford
foster
you
forgotten
to
unhitch
the
here
she
is
towing
astern
that
all
right
we
may
need
her
she
too
heavy
to
be
taken
on
board
a
careful
fellow
was
hamilton
morris
and
he
well
knew
the
value
of
a
rowboat
to
a
as
for
joe
and
fuz
they
were
compelled
to
overcome
a
strong
inward
inclination
to
cast
the
boat
loose
such
a
good
joke
it
would
have
been
but
ham
morris
was
in
the
way
of
it
so
long
as
he
stood
at
the
tiller
the
swallow
was
steady
enough
to
inspire
even
annie
foster
with
a
feeling
of
confidence
but
ford
carefully
explained
to
her
the
difference
between
slipping
over
the
little
waves
of
the
landlocked
bay
and
plunging
into
the
gigantic
billows
of
the
stormy
atlantic
i
prefer
this
said
annie
but
i
would
have
missed
the
other
for
any
thing
replied
ford
would
you
dick
richard
lee
had
taken
his
full
share
in
the
work
of
starting
and
had
made
himself
singularly
useful
but
if
all
the
rest
had
not
been
so
busy
they
would
surely
have
noticed
his
remarkable
silence
hardly
a
word
had
he
uttered
that
anybody
could
remember
and
now
he
was
forced
to
say
something
his
mouth
opened
slowly
as
if
he
had
never
tried
to
speak
before
and
was
not
quite
sure
he
knew
how
no
foster
i
would
not
have
missed
that
trip
for
a
good
deal
every
word
came
out
by
itself
afoot
and
alone
and
as
different
from
dick
ordinary
speech
as
a
cut
stone
is
from
a
rough
one
ham
morris
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
ford
puckered
his
lips
into
the
shape
of
a
still
whistle
but
annie
caught
the
meaning
of
it
quicker
than
they
did
dick
she
said
at
once
are
we
to
fish
may
be
but
that
depends
on
mr
morris
every
word
was
slowly
and
carefully
uttered
a
good
deal
in
the
manner
of
a
man
counting
over
a
lot
of
money
and
looking
out
sharp
for
counterfeits
look
here
dick
suddenly
exclaimed
dab
kinzer
i
give
it
up
you
can
do
it
but
do
you
try
to
keep
it
up
all
day
kill
you
sure
as
any
thing
if
you
do
did
i
say
all
right
dab
anxiously
inquired
dick
with
a
happy
look
on
his
merry
black
face
every
word
said
dab
but
it
well
for
you
they
were
all
short
keep
on
practising
i
jes
do
dat
shuah
practising
dick
yes
that
was
it
and
he
joined
heartily
in
the
peal
of
laughter
with
which
the
success
of
his
first
attempt
at
folks
english
was
received
by
that
party
dab
explained
that
as
soon
as
dick
found
he
was
really
to
go
to
the
academy
he
determined
to
teach
his
tongue
new
habits
and
the
whole
company
heartily
approved
even
while
they
joined
dab
in
advising
him
not
to
attempt
too
much
at
a
time
you
might
sprain
your
tongue
over
a
big
word
said
ford
there
was
an
abundance
of
talk
and
fun
all
around
as
the
swallow
skimmed
onward
and
the
outlines
of
the
long
low
were
rapidly
becoming
more
distinct
nearer
they
drew
and
nearer
is
that
a
away
over
there
asked
annie
of
dab
yes
that
a
and
there
a
close
down
by
it
a
i
say
said
ford
are
there
men
there
all
the
while
are
there
many
wrecks
on
this
coast
ever
so
many
wrecks
said
dab
and
they
keep
a
sharp
lookout
there
used
to
be
more
before
there
were
so
many
it
was
a
bad
place
to
go
ashore
in
too
almost
as
bad
as
jersey
why
well
the
coast
itself
is
mean
enough
for
shoals
and
surf
and
then
there
were
the
wreckers
oh
i
understand
said
ford
not
the
government
men
no
the
old
sort
it
was
a
bad
enough
piece
of
luck
to
be
driven
in
on
that
bar
or
another
like
it
but
the
wreckers
made
it
as
much
worse
as
they
knew
how
to
they
were
all
listening
now
even
his
sisters
and
dabney
launched
out
into
a
somewhat
description
of
the
terrors
of
the
south
shore
in
old
times
and
new
and
of
the
character
and
deeds
of
the
men
who
were
formerly
the
first
to
find
out
if
any
thing
or
anybody
had
been
driven
ashore
what
a
prize
to
them
that
french
steamer
would
have
been
said
annie
the
one
you
and
ford
took
frank
from
no
she
would
why
she
was
wrecked
at
all
she
only
stuck
her
nose
in
the
sand
and
lay
still
till
the
tugs
came
and
pulled
her
off
that
is
a
wreck
a
wreck
is
where
the
ship
is
knocked
to
pieces
and
people
are
drowned
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
the
crew
ca
help
themselves
after
that
then
you
see
the
wreckers
have
a
notion
that
every
thing
that
comes
ashore
belongs
to
them
why
i
heard
some
of
our
old
fishermen
best
kind
of
men
too
talk
of
how
government
has
robbed
them
of
their
rights
by
the
new
system
said
annie
well
first
by
having
wrecks
prevented
and
then
by
having
all
property
kept
for
the
owners
is
that
strange
did
you
say
they
were
good
men
some
of
honest
as
the
day
is
long
about
every
thing
else
but
they
were
all
so
there
was
old
peter
now
and
he
lives
on
the
island
yet
there
his
cabin
you
can
just
see
it
sticking
out
of
the
edge
of
that
big
what
a
queer
thing
it
is
queer
i
guess
you
say
so
if
you
could
have
a
look
at
the
things
he
picked
up
along
shore
and
stowed
inside
of
it
there
is
but
just
room
for
him
to
cook
and
sleep
in
is
he
a
fisherman
too
why
that
his
trade
sometimes
the
storms
drift
the
sand
high
all
over
that
cabin
and
old
pete
has
to
dig
it
out
again
he
gets
snowed
under
two
or
three
times
every
winter
annie
foster
and
probably
some
of
the
others
were
getting
new
ideas
concerning
the
and
its
inhabitants
every
minute
and
she
felt
a
good
deal
like
dick
lee
she
would
have
missed
that
trip
for
any
thing
they
were
now
coasting
along
the
island
at
no
great
distance
and
although
it
was
not
nearly
noon
dabney
heard
joe
hart
say
to
his
brother
never
was
so
hungry
in
all
my
life
glad
they
did
lay
in
a
good
stock
of
provisions
so
am
i
returned
fuz
and
he
added
in
a
whisper
is
there
any
way
for
us
to
get
into
that
cabin
joe
shook
his
head
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
for
any
small
piracy
to
be
worked
on
that
craft
so
long
as
kinzer
remained
the
stewardess
of
it
and
the
two
hungry
boys
were
compelled
to
wait
her
motions
chapter
xx
a
wreck
and
some
wreckers
dismally
barren
and
lonesome
was
that
desolate
bar
between
the
bay
and
the
ocean
here
and
there
it
swelled
up
into
great
drifts
and
mounds
of
sand
which
were
almost
large
enough
to
be
called
hills
but
nowhere
did
it
show
a
tree
or
a
bush
or
even
a
patch
of
grass
annie
foster
found
herself
getting
melancholy
as
she
gazed
upon
it
and
thought
of
how
the
winds
must
sometimes
sweep
across
it
laden
with
and
rain
and
hail
or
with
the
bitter
sleet
and
blinding
snow
of
winter
dabney
she
said
was
the
storm
very
severe
here
last
night
and
yesterday
worse
than
it
was
over
on
our
side
of
the
bay
ten
times
were
there
any
vessels
wrecked
most
likely
but
it
too
soon
to
know
just
where
at
that
moment
the
swallow
was
running
around
a
sandy
point
jutting
out
into
the
bay
from
the
foot
of
the
highest
mound
on
the
bar
not
half
a
mile
from
the
and
only
twice
as
far
from
the
low
wooden
roof
of
the
where
as
dab
had
explained
to
his
guests
the
lifeboats
and
other
apparatus
of
all
sorts
were
kept
safely
housed
the
piles
of
drifted
sand
had
for
some
time
prevented
the
brightest
eyes
on
board
the
swallow
from
seeing
any
thing
to
seaward
but
now
as
they
came
around
the
point
and
a
broad
level
lay
before
them
ham
morris
sprang
to
his
feet
in
sudden
excitement
as
he
exclaimed
in
the
breakers
why
she
must
have
been
a
it
all
up
with
her
now
look
along
the
shore
shouted
dab
some
of
saved
anyhow
the
are
there
too
and
all
so
they
were
and
ham
was
right
about
the
vessel
though
not
a
mast
was
left
standing
in
her
now
if
there
had
been
indeed
she
might
have
been
kept
off
the
breakers
as
they
afterwards
learned
she
had
been
dismasted
in
the
storm
but
had
not
struck
until
after
daylight
that
morning
and
help
had
been
close
at
hand
and
promptly
given
there
was
no
such
thing
as
saving
that
unfortunate
hull
she
would
beat
to
pieces
just
where
she
lay
sooner
or
later
according
to
the
kind
of
weather
that
might
take
the
job
in
hand
and
the
size
and
force
of
the
waves
it
should
bring
with
it
the
work
done
already
by
the
men
had
been
a
good
one
and
it
had
not
been
very
easy
either
for
they
had
brought
the
crew
and
passengers
safely
through
the
boiling
surf
and
landed
them
all
upon
the
sandy
beach
they
had
even
saved
for
them
some
items
of
baggage
in
a
few
hours
the
coast
would
be
on
hand
to
look
out
for
the
cargo
there
was
therefore
no
chance
for
the
men
to
turn
an
honest
penny
without
working
hard
for
it
work
and
wages
enough
there
would
be
to
be
sure
helping
to
unload
whenever
the
sea
now
so
heavy
should
go
down
a
little
but
work
and
wages
were
not
the
precise
things
some
of
them
were
most
hungry
for
two
of
them
at
all
events
one
a
tall
grizzled
old
man
in
tattered
raiment
and
the
other
more
battered
still
but
with
no
look
of
the
sea
about
him
stood
on
a
gloomily
gazing
at
the
group
of
shipwrecked
people
on
the
shore
and
the
helpless
mass
of
timber
and
spars
out
there
among
the
beatings
of
the
surf
not
more
three
hunder
yards
out
she
break
up
soon
there
was
no
one
to
hender
wot
a
show
we
hev
i
reckon
growled
the
shorter
man
your
name
peter
ay
i
belong
yer
allers
lived
mark
whar
ye
come
from
the
only
answer
was
a
sharp
and
excited
exclamation
neither
of
them
had
been
paying
any
attention
to
the
bay
side
of
the
bar
and
while
they
were
gazing
at
the
wreck
a
very
pretty
little
yacht
had
cast
anchor
close
in
shore
and
then
with
the
help
of
a
rowboat
quite
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
latter
somewhat
for
the
greater
part
had
made
their
way
to
the
land
and
were
now
hurrying
forward
they
did
not
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
peter
and
his
companion
but
in
a
few
minutes
more
they
were
trying
to
talk
to
those
poor
people
on
the
seaward
beach
trying
but
not
succeeding
very
well
for
the
wreck
had
been
a
bremen
bark
with
an
assorted
cargo
and
some
fifty
passengers
all
emigrants
german
seemed
to
be
their
only
tongue
and
none
of
kinzer
spoke
german
too
bad
ford
foster
was
saying
about
it
when
there
came
a
sort
of
wail
from
a
group
at
a
little
distance
and
it
seemed
to
close
with
enfant
french
exclaimed
ford
why
they
look
as
dutch
as
any
of
the
rest
come
on
annie
let
try
and
speak
to
them
the
rest
followed
a
good
deal
like
a
flock
of
sheep
and
it
was
a
sad
enough
scene
that
lay
before
them
no
lives
had
been
lost
in
the
wreck
but
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
suffering
among
the
poor
passengers
cooped
up
between
decks
with
the
hatches
closed
while
the
storm
lasted
nobody
drowned
indeed
but
all
had
been
dreadfully
soaked
in
the
surf
in
getting
ashore
and
among
the
rest
had
been
the
child
now
lying
there
on
his
mother
lap
so
pinched
and
blue
and
seemingly
so
nearly
lifeless
french
were
they
yes
and
no
for
the
father
a
tall
stout
young
man
who
looked
like
a
farmer
told
ford
they
were
from
alsace
and
spoke
both
languages
the
child
was
it
sick
not
so
much
sick
as
dying
of
starvation
and
exposure
oh
such
a
sad
pleading
look
as
the
poor
mother
lifted
to
the
moist
eyes
of
kinzer
when
the
portly
widow
pushed
forward
and
bent
over
the
silent
boy
such
a
pretty
child
he
must
have
been
and
not
over
two
years
old
but
the
salt
water
was
in
his
tangled
curls
now
and
his
poor
lips
were
parted
in
a
weak
sick
way
that
told
of
utter
exhaustion
can
any
thing
be
done
mother
yes
dabney
there
can
you
and
ham
and
ford
and
frank
go
to
the
yacht
quick
as
you
can
and
bring
the
lamp
and
all
and
bread
and
milk
and
every
dry
napkin
and
towel
you
can
find
bring
shawl
such
quick
time
they
made
across
that
they
were
none
too
soon
either
for
as
they
came
running
down
to
their
boat
a
slouching
sort
of
fellow
walked
rapidly
away
from
it
he
was
going
to
steal
it
ca
go
for
him
now
dab
but
you
have
to
mount
guard
here
while
we
go
back
with
the
things
there
was
a
good
deal
of
the
guard
mounted
look
in
dab
face
when
they
left
him
a
few
minutes
later
standing
there
by
the
boat
and
he
had
one
of
the
oars
in
his
hand
an
oar
is
almost
as
good
a
club
as
the
lower
joint
of
a
and
that
was
exactly
the
thought
in
mind
ham
and
frank
and
ford
hurried
back
to
the
other
beach
to
find
that
kinzer
had
taken
complete
possession
of
that
baby
every
rag
of
his
damp
things
was
already
stripped
off
and
now
while
miranda
lighted
the
heater
and
made
some
milk
hot
in
a
minute
the
good
lady
began
to
rub
the
little
sufferer
as
only
an
experienced
mother
knows
how
then
there
was
a
warm
in
cloths
and
shawls
and
better
success
than
anybody
had
dreamed
of
in
making
the
seemingly
child
eat
something
that
was
about
all
the
matter
with
him
said
kinzer
now
if
we
can
get
him
and
his
mother
over
to
the
house
we
can
save
both
of
them
ford
how
long
did
you
say
it
was
since
they
eaten
any
thing
about
three
days
they
say
mercy
on
me
and
that
cabin
of
ours
holds
so
little
glad
it
full
anyhow
let
get
every
thing
out
and
over
here
right
away
the
cabin
no
hamilton
the
provisions
not
a
soul
among
them
all
thought
of
their
own
lunch
any
more
than
kinzer
herself
did
but
joe
and
fuz
were
not
among
them
just
then
on
the
contrary
they
were
over
there
by
the
shore
where
the
jenny
had
been
pulled
up
trying
to
get
dab
kinzer
to
put
them
on
board
the
swallow
somebody
ought
to
be
on
board
of
her
said
fuz
in
as
anxious
a
tone
as
he
could
assume
with
so
many
strange
people
around
it
is
safe
added
joe
fact
replied
dab
but
then
i
kind
o
like
to
feel
a
little
unsafe
the
hart
boys
had
a
feeling
at
that
moment
that
somehow
or
other
dab
knew
why
they
were
so
anxious
to
go
on
board
and
they
were
right
enough
for
he
was
saying
to
himself
they
can
wait
they
do
look
hungry
but
they
live
through
it
there
ai
any
cuffs
or
collars
in
ham
locker
all
there
was
then
in
the
locker
was
soon
out
of
it
after
kinzer
and
the
rest
came
for
they
brought
with
them
the
officers
of
the
wrecked
bark
and
neither
joe
nor
fuz
had
an
opportunity
to
so
much
as
help
distribute
that
supply
of
provisions
ham
went
over
to
see
that
the
distribution
should
be
properly
made
while
kinzer
saw
her
little
patient
with
his
father
and
mother
safely
stowed
on
board
the
swallow
i
save
that
baby
anyhow
she
said
to
miranda
and
ford
says
his
father
a
farmer
we
can
find
plenty
for
to
do
they
never
see
a
thing
of
their
baggage
and
i
guess
they
had
a
great
deal
she
was
just
the
woman
to
guess
correctly
about
such
a
matter
at
that
moment
dabney
was
saying
to
annie
foster
whom
do
you
guess
i
seen
i
ca
guess
who
was
it
the
tramp
the
same
one
the
very
same
there
he
goes
over
the
sandhill
yonder
with
old
peter
the
wrecker
we
got
to
hurry
home
now
but
i
going
to
set
ham
morris
on
his
track
before
we
get
through
you
never
find
him
again
do
you
old
peter
befriend
a
man
that
did
what
he
did
right
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
no
indeed
there
is
a
fisherman
from
here
to
montauk
that
would
join
to
hunt
him
out
he
safe
to
be
found
whenever
ham
wants
him
if
we
do
scare
him
away
now
do
scare
him
then
almost
whispered
annie
the
wind
was
fair
and
the
home
sail
of
the
swallow
was
really
a
swift
and
short
one
but
it
did
seem
dreadfully
long
to
her
passengers
kinzer
was
anxious
to
see
that
poor
baby
and
his
mother
safely
in
bed
ham
wanted
to
send
a
whole
load
of
refreshments
back
to
the
shipwrecked
people
dab
kinzer
could
not
keep
his
thoughts
from
following
that
tramp
and
then
if
the
truth
must
come
out
every
soul
on
board
the
beautiful
little
yacht
was
getting
more
and
more
painfully
aware
with
every
minute
that
passed
that
they
had
had
a
good
deal
of
and
excitement
and
a
splendid
sail
across
the
bay
but
no
dinner
not
so
much
as
a
red
herring
and
a
cracker
chapter
xxi
dab
and
his
friends
turn
themselves
into
cooks
and
waiters
as
for
the
kinzers
that
was
by
no
means
their
first
experience
in
such
matters
but
none
of
their
friends
had
ever
before
been
so
near
an
shipwreck
it
is
quite
possible
moreover
that
they
had
never
before
been
so
nearly
starved
as
they
were
that
day
at
least
something
to
that
effect
was
remarked
by
joe
hart
and
fuz
more
than
a
dozen
times
apiece
while
the
swallow
was
threading
the
crooked
inlet
and
making
her
way
to
the
landing
ham
said
dab
are
you
going
right
back
again
course
i
am
soon
as
i
can
get
a
load
of
eatables
together
from
the
house
and
the
village
you
have
to
stay
here
why
ca
i
go
with
you
plenty
for
you
to
do
at
the
house
and
around
while
i
gone
no
you
ca
go
dab
seemed
to
have
expected
as
much
for
he
turned
to
ford
with
then
ford
i
tell
you
what
we
must
do
what
that
we
must
see
about
the
famine
can
you
cook
no
i
can
then
ham
have
one
half
of
our
house
at
work
getting
his
cargo
ready
and
that
baby
fill
up
the
other
half
mother
wo
be
expecting
us
so
soon
and
our
cook
gone
out
for
the
day
annie
knows
something
she
can
help
me
then
those
hart
boys
die
if
they
not
fed
pretty
soon
look
at
fuz
why
he
ca
keep
his
mouth
shut
joe
and
his
brother
seemed
to
know
as
if
by
instinct
that
the
dinner
question
was
under
discussion
and
they
were
soon
taking
at
least
their
share
of
the
talk
oh
how
they
did
wish
it
had
been
a
share
of
something
to
eat
instead
the
swallow
was
carefully
moored
after
discharging
her
passengers
but
dab
did
not
start
for
the
house
with
his
mother
and
the
rest
he
even
managed
to
detain
some
of
the
empty
large
ones
too
come
on
kinzer
shouted
joe
hart
let
put
for
the
village
we
starve
here
a
fellow
that
starve
here
just
deserves
to
that
all
said
dabney
ford
there
bill
lee
boat
and
three
others
coming
in
all
right
one
of
a
dredger
ford
and
frank
could
only
guess
what
their
friend
was
up
to
but
dab
was
not
doing
any
sort
of
guessing
bill
he
shouted
as
dick
lee
father
came
within
hearing
bill
put
a
lot
of
your
best
panfish
in
this
basket
and
then
go
and
fetch
us
some
lobsters
there
half
a
dozen
in
your
pot
did
those
others
have
any
luck
more
responded
bill
then
we
take
both
lots
the
respect
of
the
city
boys
for
the
resources
of
the
shore
in
a
time
of
famine
began
to
rise
rapidly
a
few
moments
later
for
not
only
was
one
of
dab
baskets
promptly
laden
with
panfish
such
as
porgies
blackfish
and
perch
but
two
others
received
all
the
clams
and
oysters
they
were
at
all
anxious
to
carry
to
the
house
at
the
same
time
bill
lee
offered
as
an
amendment
on
the
lobster
question
yer

just

dick

over

bill
lee
would
have
sent

and
all
on
a
suggestion
that
the
kinzers
or
the
fosters
were
in
need
of
it
and
dick
would
have
carried
it
over
for
him
as
for

when
her
son

running
in
with
his
errand
she
exclaimed

insisted
however
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
back
door
of
the
old
kinzer
homestead
with
his
load
the
kitchen
beyond
that
door
had
become
almost
as
busy
a
place
as
was
that
of
miranda
morris
a
few
rods
away
ford
suddenly
exclaimed
dab
as
he
finished
scaling
a
large
porgy
what
if
mother
should
make
a
mistake
make
a
mistake
how
cook
that
baby
it
awful
why
its
mother
there
yes
but
they
put
her
to
bed
and
its
father
too
hey
here
come
the
lobsters
now
ford
the
rest
of
what
he
had
to
say
was
given
in
a
whisper
and
was
not
even
heard
by
annie
foster
who
was
just
then
looking
prettier
than
ever
as
she
busied
herself
around
the
the
bloom
that
was
coming
up
into
her
face
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
as
for
the
hart
boys
foster
had
invited
them
to
come
into
the
parlor
and
talk
with
her
until
dinner
should
be
ready
she
added
with
her
usual
smile
that
there
were
cooks
enough
in
the
kitchen
such
a
frying
and
broiling
before
ham
morris
was
ready
with
his
cargo
for
his
trip
back
to
the
wreck
and
right
in
the
midst
of
his
greatest
hurry
word
came
over
from
foster
that
the
table
was
waiting
for
them
all
even
kinzer
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
satisfaction
there
was
nothing
more
in
the
wide
world
that
she
could
do
just
then
for
either
that
baby
or
its
unfortunate
parents
and
she
was
beginning
to
worry
about
her
and
how
she
should
manage
to
get
him
to
eat
something
for
ham
morris
had
worked
himself
into
a
high
state
of
excitement
in
his
benevolent
haste
and
did
not
seem
to
know
that
he
was
hungry
miranda
had
entirely
sympathized
with
her
husband
until
the
arrival
of
that
message
from
foster
o
hamilton
and
good
foster
must
have
cooked
it
all
herself
no
miranda
said
ham
thoughtfully
our
dabney
went
home
with
ford
and
annie
i
ca
stay
more
than
a
minute
but
i
think
we
better
go
right
over
there
a
good
many
things
to
come
yet
from
the
village
go
they
did
while
the
charitable
neighbors
whom
ham
had
stirred
up
concerning
the
wreck
attended
to
the
completion
of
the
cargo
of
the
swallow
more
than
that
was
true
for
at
least
one
other
good
and
boat
would
be
ready
to
accompany
her
on
her
return
trip
across
the
bay
laden
with
creature
comforts
of
all
sorts
even
old
jock
the
village
not
by
any
means
the
best
man
in
the
world
had
come
waddling
down
to
the
landing
with
a
demijohn
of
old
and
his
gift
had
been
kindly
accepted
by
the
special
advice
of
the
village
physician
that
sort
of
thing
has
made
plenty
of
shipwrecks
around
here
said
the
man
of
medicine
and
the
people
on
the
bar
have
swallowed
so
much
salt
water
the
ca
hurt
maybe
the
doctor
was
wrong
about
it
but
the
demijohn
went
over
to
the
wreck
in
the
swallow
very
much
to
the
gratification
of
old
jock
foster
was
not
a
large
one
there
were
no
large
rooms
in
that
house
nevertheless
the
entire
party
managed
to
gather
around
the
table
all
except
dab
and
ford
dab
is
head
cook
and
i
head
waiter
had
been
ford
explanation
frank
and
the
boys
are
company
certainly
the
cook
had
no
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
his
work
the
coffee
was
excellent
the
fish
was
done
to
a
turn
the
oysters
roasted
broiled
or
stewed
and
likewise
the
clams
were
all
that
could
have
been
asked
of
them
bread
there
was
in
abundance
and
all
things
were
going
finely
till
kinzer
asked
her
son
as
his
face
showed
itself
at
the
dabney
you
not
sent
in
your
vegetables
we
waiting
for
them
dab
face
grew
redder
and
he
came
near
dropping
a
plate
he
held
in
his
hand
vegetables
oh
yes
well
ford
we
might
as
well
send
them
in
now
i
got
them
all
ready
annie
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
hard
at
her
brother
for
she
knew
very
well
that
not
so
much
as
a
potato
had
been
thought
of
in
their
preparations
ford
himself
looked
a
little
queer
but
he
marched
right
out
white
apron
and
all
a
minute
or
so
later
the
two
boys
came
in
again
each
bearing
aloft
a
huge
platter
one
of
these
was
solemnly
deposited
at
each
end
of
the
table
vegetables
why
they
lobsters
o
ford
how
could
you
the
last
exclamation
came
from
annie
foster
as
she
clapped
her
hands
over
her
face
were
those
lobsters
and
fellows
every
one
of
them
in
spite
of
lee
poor
opinion
but
they
were
a
little
too
well
dressed
even
for
a
their
thick
shoulders
were
adorned
with
collars
of
the
daintiest
material
and
finish
while
every
ungainly
flipper
wore
a
cuff
which
had
been
manufactured
for
a
different
kind
of
wrist
there
were
plenty
of
cuffs
and
collars
and
queer
enough
the
lobsters
looked
in
them
all
the
queerer
because
every
item
of
lace
and
linen
was
variegated
with
huge
black
spots
and
blotches
as
if
some
one
had
begun
to
wash
it
in
ink
joe
and
fuz
were
almost
as
red
as
the
lobsters
and
foster
face
looked
as
severe
as
it
could
but
that
is
not
saying
a
great
deal
the
kinzer
family
knew
all
about
those
cuffs
and
collars
and
ham
morris
and
the
younger
ladies
were
trying
hard
not
to
laugh
joe
said
fuz
snappishly
ca
you
take
a
joke
annie
got
the
laugh
on
us
this
time
i
exclaimed
annie
indignantly
no
indeed
that
some
of
work
and
mr
kinzer
i
ashamed
of
you
poor
dab
he
muttered
something
about
those
being
all
the
vegetables
he
had
and
retreated
to
the
kitchen
joe
and
fuz
however
were
not
of
the
sort
that
take
offence
easily
and
they
were
shortly
helping
themselves
quite
liberally
to
lobster
cuffs
or
no
cuffs
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
to
restore
harmony
at
the
table
but
dab
plan
for
punishing
the
hart
boys
was
a
complete
failure
as
ford
told
him
afterwards
feel
it
not
they
you
might
as
well
try
to
hurt
a
clam
with
a
pin
and
i
hurt
your
sister
feelings
instead
of
theirs
said
dab
well
i
never
try
any
thing
like
it
again
anyhow
joe
and
fuz
comfortable
they
ate
too
many
roasted
clams
and
a
good
deal
too
much
lobster
there
was
a
certain
degree
of
consolation
to
be
had
from
such
a
fact
as
that
chapter
xxii
the
real
mission
of
the
jug
ham
morris
ate
well
when
he
once
got
at
it
but
he
did
not
linger
long
at
the
for
his
heart
was
in
the
swallow
dab
would
have
given
more
than
ever
for
the
privilege
of
going
with
him
not
that
he
felt
so
dreadfully
charitable
but
that
he
did
not
care
to
prolong
his
stay
at
foster
as
cook
or
otherwise
he
had
not
by
any
means
lost
his
appetite
although
he
seemed
disposed
to
neglect
the
lobsters
and
when
he
had
taken
proper
care
of
it
he
hurried
away
on
an
errand
for
his
mother
in
the
direction
of
the
village
nearly
everybody
he
met
had
some
question
or
other
to
ask
him
about
the
wreck
and
it
was
not
to
have
been
expected
that
jenny
walters
would
let
her
old
acquaintance
pass
her
without
a
word
or
so
dab
answered
as
well
as
he
could
considering
the
disturbed
state
of
his
mind
but
he
wound
up
with
jenny
i
wish
you
come
over
to
our
house
by
and
by
what
for
oh
i
got
something
to
show
you
something
you
never
saw
before
do
you
mean
your
new
baby
the
one
you
found
on
the
bar
yes
but
that
baby
jenny
what
wonderful
about
it
why
it
only
two
years
old
and
it
can
squall
in
two
languages
that
a
good
deal
more
than
you
can
do
they
say
your
friend
miss
foster
speaks
french
retorted
jenny
was
she
ever
shipwrecked
in
french
may
be
so
but
not
in
german
well
dabney
i
do
propose
to
squall
in
any
thing
are
your
folks
going
to
burn
any
more
of
their
barns
this
year
not
unless
samantha
gets
married
jenny
do
you
know
what
the
latest
fashion
in
lobsters
changeable
green
i
suppose
no
i
mean
after
they
boiled
it
to
have
come
on
the
table
in
cuffs
and
collars
lace
around
their
necks
you
know
and
gloves
no
not
any
gloves
we
had
lobsters
at
foster
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
dabney
kinzer
it
time
you
went
to
school
again
i
going
in
a
few
days
going
do
you
mean
you
going
away
somewhere
ever
so
far
and
dick
lee
going
with
me
i
heard
about
him
but
i
did
know
he
meant
to
take
you
along
very
kind
of
dick
i
you
wo
speak
to
common
people
when
you
get
back
now
jenny
dabney
perhaps
i
come
over
before
you
go
if
only
to
take
a
look
at
that
shipwrecked
baby
a
good
many
of
kinzer
lady
friends
young
and
old
deemed
it
their
duty
to
come
and
do
that
very
thing
within
the
next
few
days
then
the
took
the
matter
up
and
both
the
baby
and
its
mother
were
provided
for
as
they
never
had
been
before
it
would
have
taken
more
languages
than
two
to
fairly
express
the
gratitude
of
the
poor
alsatians
as
for
the
rest
of
them
out
there
on
the
bar
they
were
speedily
taken
off
and
carried
to
the
city
none
of
them
being
seriously
the
worse
for
their
sufferings
after
all
ham
morris
declared
that
the
family
he
had
brought
ashore
came
just
in
time
to
help
him
out
with
his
fall
work
and
he
did
see
any
charity
in
it
good
for
ham
it
was
the
right
way
to
feel
about
it
but
dab
kinzer
thought
he
could
see
something
in
it
that
looked
like
charity
when
he
met
his
on
his
late
return
from
that
second
trip
across
the
bay
real
charity
never
cares
to
make
an
exhibition
of
itself
they
were
pretty
thoroughly
worn
out
both
of
them
but
they
carefully
moored
the
swallow
in
her
usual
berth
before
they
left
her
she
had
effectually
discharged
her
cargo
over
on
the
but
they
had
enough
of
a
load
to
carry
home
in
the
shape
of
empty
baskets
and
things
of
that
sort
is
every
thing
out
of
the
locker
dab
inquired
ham
all
but
the
jug
i
say
did
you
know
it
was
nearly
half
full
would
it
do
any
hurt
to
leave
it
here
the
jug
no
not
if
you
just
pour
out
the
rest
of
the
over
the
side
make
the
fish
drunk
well
it
do
that
for
anybody
else
if
i
can
help
it
well
if
it
good
for
people
i
guess
it
ca
hurt
the
fish
empty
it
dab
empty
it
and
come
along
the
doctor
was
so
far
wrong
and
i
was
glad
to
have
it
with
me
seemed
to
do
some
of
a
power
of
good
but
medicine
medicine
and
i
only
wish
some
people
i
know
of
would
remember
it
some
of
do
a
good
deal
of
that
kind
of
doctoring
the
condemned
liquor
was
already
gurgling
from
the
mouth
of
the
demijohn
into
the
salt
water
and
neither
fish
nor
eel
came
forward
to
get
a
share
of
it
they
were
probably
all
feeling
pretty
well
that
night
when
the
demijohn
was
empty
and
the
cork
replaced
it
was
set
down
again
in
the
cabin
and
that
was
left
unlocked
for
there
was
no
more
danger
in
it
for
anybody
dab
and
ham
were
altogether
too
tired
to
take
any
pains
there
was
no
call
for
dab
mind
must
have
been
tired
as
well
as
his
body
for
he
decided
to
postpone
until
the
morrow
the
report
he
had
to
make
about
the
tramp
he
was
strongly
of
the
opinion
that
the
latter
had
not
seen
him
to
recognize
him
and
at
all
events
the
matter
could
wait
so
it
came
to
pass
that
all
the
shore
and
the
road
that
led
away
from
it
and
the
village
the
road
led
into
were
deserted
and
silent
an
hour
or
so
later
when
a
with
her
one
sail
lowered
was
quietly
sculled
up
the
inlet
there
were
two
men
on
board
a
tall
one
and
a
shorter
one
and
they
ran
their
boat
right
alongside
the
swallow
as
if
that
were
the
precise
thing
they
had
come
to
do
burgin
remarked
the
tall
man
wot
ef
we
do
find
any
thin
arter
all
this
sailin
and
rowin
and
scullin
most
likely
he
kerried
it
to
the
house
in
course
he
has
the
keenly
watchful
eyes
of
burgin
had
noted
the
arrival
of
that
at
the
island
and
they
had
closely
followed
its
fortunes
from
first
to
last
he
had
more
than
half
tried
indeed
to
work
himself
in
among
the
crowd
as
one
of
the
sufferers
but
with
no
manner
of
success
the
officers
of
the
ship
knew
every
face
that
had
any
right
to
a
spoonful
and
burgin
failed
to
pass
him
he
had
not
failed
however
to
note
that
his
coveted
medicine
was
by
no
means
exhausted
and
to
see
ham
stow
the
demijohn
carefully
away
at
last
under
the
of
the
swallow
that
information
had
given
all
the
inducement
required
to
get
old
peter
and
his
boat
across
the
bay
and
the
ancient
wrecker
was
as
anxious
about
the
result
as
the
tramp
himself
could
be
it
was
hard
to
say
now
which
of
them
was
the
first
on
board
the
swallow
it
ai
locked
then
the
jug
ai
thar
wall
it
is
exclaimed
burgin
triumphantly
as
he
pulled
it
out
but
his
under
jaw
dropped
a
little
when
he
felt
how
light
it
lifted
reckon
they
helped
themselves
on
thar
way
hum
it
was
a
good
deal
worse
than
that
and
an
angry
and
disappointed
pair
were
they
when
the
cork
and
the
truth
came
out
thar
jest
a
good
smell
that
was
old
peter
remark
and
it
sounded
as
if
words
failed
him
to
add
to
it
but
burgin
wrath
exploded
in
a
torrent
of
bitter
abuse
of
the
man
or
men
who
had
emptied
that
demijohn
he
gave
old
peter
a
capital
chance
to
turn
upon
him
morosely
with
look
my
chap
is
this
your
boat
no
i
did
say
it
was
did
i
is
that
there
your
jug
i
do
know
if
i
keer
to
sit
and
hear
one
of
my
neighbors
and
he
a
good
feller
too
he
is
abused
all
night
jest
bekase
i
been
and
let
an
entire
stranger
make
a
fool
of
me
do
you
mean
me
well
ef
i
did
i
would
say
it
do
you
git
mad
now
it
pay
ye
jest
let
take
a
turn
the
village
you
kin
go
ef
you
want
ter
i
wait
for
ye
like
i
did
feel
much
like
doin
any
trampin
stay
thar
then
but
mind
you
do
try
on
any
runnin
away
with
my
boat
if
i
want
a
boat
old
man
there
plenty
here
that
better
worth
stealin
than
yourn
that
so
i
did
know
you
been
makin
any
kalkilation
on
it
i
wo
be
gone
any
great
while
he
was
gone
some
time
however
whatever
may
have
been
his
errand
old
peter
was
not
the
man
to
be
at
a
loss
for
one
of
some
sort
even
at
that
hour
of
the
night
and
his
present
business
perhaps
did
not
particularly
require
company
when
he
returned
at
last
he
found
his
own
boat
safe
enough
and
he
really
could
not
tell
if
any
of
the
others
had
walked
away
but
he
looked
around
in
vain
for
any
signs
of
his
late
comrade
not
that
he
spent
much
time
or
wasted
any
great
pains
in
searching
for
him
and
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
gave
it
up
gone
has
he
well
then
it
a
good
riddance
to
bad
rubbidge
i
no
aingil
but
that
feller
a
long
ways
i
am
whether
or
not
old
peter
was
right
in
his
estimate
of
himself
or
of
burgin
in
a
few
moments
more
he
was
all
alone
in
his
and
was
sculling
it
rapidly
out
of
the
crooked
inlet
his
search
for
burgin
had
been
a
careless
one
for
he
had
but
glanced
over
the
gunwale
of
the
swallow
a
second
look
might
have
shown
him
the
form
of
the
tramp
half
covered
by
a
loose
flap
of
the
sail
deeply
and
heavily
sleeping
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
it
was
every
bit
as
comfortable
a
bed
as
he
had
been
used
to
and
there
he
was
still
lying
long
after
the
sun
had
looked
in
upon
him
the
next
morning
other
eyes
than
the
sun
were
to
look
in
upon
him
before
he
awakened
from
that
untimely
and
imprudent
nap
it
was
not
so
very
early
when
ham
morris
and
dabney
kinzer
were
stirring
again
but
they
had
both
arisen
with
a
strong
desire
for
a
talk
and
ham
made
an
opportunity
for
one
by
saying
come
on
dab
let
go
down
and
have
a
look
at
swallow
ham
had
meant
to
talk
about
school
and
kindred
matters
but
dab
first
words
about
the
tramp
cut
off
all
other
subjects
you
ought
to
have
told
me
he
said
i
have
had
him
tied
up
in
a
minute
dab
explained
as
well
as
he
could
but
before
he
had
finished
ham
suddenly
exclaimed
there
dick
lee
on
board
swallow
what
on
earth
he
there
for
dick
shouted
dabney
dab
did
yo
set
this
yer
boat
to
trap
somebody
no
why
you
done
gone
an
cotched
jes
you
come
an
see
the
sound
of
dick
voice
so
near
them
reached
the
dull
ears
of
the
slumbering
tramp
and
as
ham
and
dabney
sprang
into
a
yawl
and
pushed
the
yacht
his
unpleasant
face
was
slowly
and
sleepily
lifted
above
the
rail
it
the
very
man
excitedly
shouted
dabney
the
tramp
yes
the
tramp
no
one
would
have
suspected
ham
morris
of
so
much
agility
although
his
broad
and
frame
promised
abundant
strength
but
he
was
on
board
the
swallow
like
a
flash
and
burgin
was
pinned
by
his
iron
grasp
before
he
could
so
much
as
guess
what
was
coming
le
go
o
me
i
got
you
it
was
too
late
for
any
such
thing
as
resistance
and
the
captive
settled
at
once
into
a
sullen
dogged
silence
after
the
ordinary
custom
of
his
kind
when
they
find
themselves
cornered
it
is
a
species
of
dull
brute
instinct
more
than
cunning
seemingly
but
not
a
word
more
did
ham
and
dab
obtain
from
their
prisoner
although
they
said
a
good
many
to
him
until
they
delivered
him
over
to
the
of
the
lawful
authorities
at
the
village
that
done
they
went
home
to
breakfast
feeling
that
they
had
made
a
good
morning
work
of
it
but
wondering
what
would
be
the
end
and
result
of
it
all
ten
years
i
guess
said
ham
in
state
prison
yes
breaking
stone
he
get
his
board
free
but
it
be
total
abstinence
for
him
i
wonder
what
took
him
on
board
swallow
i
know
the
jug
that
it
sure
you
live
i
saw
him
over
on
the
island
i
declare
to
think
of
an
empty
demijohn
having
so
much
good
in
it
chapter
xxiii
another
grand
plan
and
a
very
grand
runaway
the
whole
community
was
stirred
up
over
the
news
of
the
capture
of
the
tramp
it
made
a
excitement
for
a
place
of
that
size
but
none
of
the
inhabitants
took
a
deeper
interest
in
the
matter
than
did
ford
and
frank
and
the
two
hart
boys
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
get
their
minds
quite
right
about
it
especially
the
first
pair
to
whom
it
was
a
matter
of
unasked
question
just
how
much
help
ham
had
given
dab
in
capturing
the
marauder
foster
himself
got
a
little
excited
about
it
when
he
came
home
but
poor
annie
was
a
good
deal
more
troubled
than
pleased
o
mother
she
exclaimed
do
you
suppose
i
shall
have
to
appear
in
court
and
give
my
testimony
as
a
witness
i
hope
not
my
dear
perhaps
your
father
can
manage
to
prevent
it
somehow
it
would
not
have
been
an
easy
thing
to
do
even
for
so
good
a
lawyer
as
foster
if
burgin
himself
had
not
saved
them
all
trouble
on
that
score
long
before
the
slow
processes
of
country
criminal
justice
could
bring
him
to
actual
trial
so
many
misdeeds
were
brought
home
to
him
from
here
and
there
that
he
gave
the
matter
up
and
not
only
confessed
to
the
attack
on
annie
but
to
the
to
which
dab
cudgelling
had
provoked
him
he
made
his
case
so
very
clear
that
when
he
finally
came
before
a
judge
and
jury
and
pleaded
guilty
there
was
nothing
left
for
them
to
do
but
to
say
just
what
he
was
guilty
of
and
how
long
he
should
break
stone
to
pay
for
it
it
was
likely
to
be
a
good
deal
more
than
ten
years
if
he
lived
out
his
time
all
that
came
to
pass
some
months
later
however
and
just
now
the
village
had
enough
to
talk
about
in
discussing
the
peculiar
manner
of
his
capture
the
story
of
the
demijohn
leaked
out
of
course
and
while
it
did
not
rob
dab
and
ham
of
any
part
of
their
glory
it
was
made
to
do
severe
duty
in
the
way
of
a
temperance
lecture
old
jock
indeed
protested
you
see
boys
said
he
real
good
liquor
like
that
do
do
nobody
no
harm
that
was
the
real
stuff
prime
old
i
had
in
my
cellar
ten
year
last
christmas
an
it
jest
toled
that
feller
across
the
bay
and
captered
him
without
no
manner
of
diffikilty
there
were
some
among
his
auditors
who
could
have
testified
to
a
decidedly
different
kind
of
capture
one
effect
of
dab
work
on
the
day
of
the
including
his
special
performances
as
cook
and
as
milliner
to
the
lobsters
was
that
he
felt
himself
thenceforth
bound
to
be
somewhat
carefully
polite
to
joe
and
fuz
the
remaining
days
of
their
visit
would
have
been
altogether
too
few
for
the
varied
entertainments
he
laid
out
for
them
in
his
own
mind
by
way
of
reparation
for
his
unlucky
practical
joke
they
were
to
catch
all
there
was
in
the
bay
they
were
to
ride
everywhere
they
were
to
be
shown
every
thing
there
was
to
see
they
do
deserve
it
dab
said
ford
but
you
a
real
good
fellow
mother
says
so
does
she
said
dab
and
he
evidently
felt
a
good
deal
relieved
after
that
richard
lee
when
his
friends
once
more
found
time
to
think
of
him
had
almost
disappeared
from
the
public
eye
some
three
days
after
the
trip
while
all
the
other
boys
were
out
in
the
jenny
having
a
good
time
with
their
hooks
and
lines
mother
made
her
appearance
in
kinzer
or
miranda
with
a
face
that
was
even
darker
than
usual
with
a
cloud
of
motherly
anxiety
miss
kinzer
she
said
has
you

wish

jes
take
a
good
look

kinzer
promised
and
she
gave
her
black
friend
what
comfort
she
could
but
dick
lee
tongue
would
never
again
be
the
member
of
society
it
had
been
even
when
at
home
and
about
his
commonest
chores
he
was
all
the
while
struggling
with
what
he
called
his
pronounciation
if
he
should
succeed
as
well
with
the
rest
of
his
schooling
it
was
safe
to
say
that
it
would
not
be
thrown
away
upon
him
glorianna
went
her
way
that
morning
and
the
next
to
intrude
upon
kinzer
special
domain
was
her
himself
accompanied
by
his
blooming
bride
we
got
a
plan
you
apian
what
about
dab
and
his
friends
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
tolerably
long
consultation
and
the
results
of
it
were
duly
reported
to
dabney
when
he
came
home
with
his
fish
a
party
he
exclaimed
when
his
mother
finished
her
brief
but
comprehensive
statement
ham
and
miranda
to
give
a
party
for
us
boys
well
now
if
they
not
right
down
good
but
mother
we
have
to
get
it
up
mighty
quick
i
know
it
dab
but
that
easy
enough
with
all
the
help
we
have
take
care
of
that
a
party
but
mother
what
can
we
do
there
only
a
few
of
know
how
to
dance
i
do
for
one
you
must
talk
it
over
with
ford
perhaps
annie
and
frank
can
help
you
they
were
all
taken
into
counsel
soon
enough
and
endless
were
the
plans
and
propositions
made
till
even
kinzer
found
her
temper
getting
a
little
fretted
and
worried
over
them
at
all
events
it
was
a
settled
fact
that
the
party
was
to
be
and
the
invitations
went
out
in
due
and
proper
form
miranda
said
her
mother
on
the
morning
of
the
important
day
we
must
manage
to
get
rid
of
dabney
and
those
boys
for
a
few
hours
send
for
some
greens
to
rig
the
parlor
with
suggested
ham
let
take
the
ponies
do
you
think
the
ponies
are
safe
for
them
to
drive
just
now
oh
dab
can
handle
they
a
trifle
skittish
that
all
they
need
a
little
exercise
so
they
did
but
it
was
to
be
doubted
if
the
best
way
to
secure
it
for
them
was
to
send
them
out
in
a
light
wagon
with
a
load
of
five
lively
boys
now
do
you
let
one
of
the
other
boys
touch
the
reins
said
kinzer
dab
promise
to
that
effect
proved
a
hard
one
to
keep
for
fuz
and
joe
almost
tried
to
take
the
reins
away
from
him
before
they
had
driven
two
miles
from
the
house
he
was
firm
however
and
they
managed
to
reach
the
strip
of
woodland
some
five
miles
inland
where
they
were
to
gather
their
load
without
any
disaster
but
it
was
evident
to
dab
all
the
way
that
his
ponies
were
in
uncommonly
high
condition
he
took
them
out
of
the
wagon
while
the
rest
began
to
gather
their
liberal
harvest
of
evergreens
and
he
did
not
bring
them
near
it
again
until
all
was
ready
for
the
start
homeward
now
boys
he
said
you
get
in
joe
and
ford
and
fuz
on
the
back
seat
to
hold
down
the
greens
frank
get
up
there
forward
while
i
hitch
in
the
ponies
these
fellows
are
chuck
full
of
mischief
very
full
certainly
nor
did
dab
kinzer
know
exactly
what
the
matter
was
for
a
minute
or
so
after
he
seized
the
reins
and
sprang
up
beside
frank
harley
then
indeed
as
the
ponies
kicked
and
reared
and
plunged
he
thought
he
saw
something
work
out
from
under
their
collars
and
fall
to
the
ground
an
is
just
the
thing
to
worry
a
restive
horse
if
put
in
such
a
place
but
joe
and
fuz
had
hardly
expected
their
little
joke
to
be
so
very
successful
as
it
was
the
ponies
were
off
now
joe
shouted
fuz
let
jump
do
let
ford
exclaimed
dab
giving
his
whole
energies
to
the
horses
they
break
their
necks
if
they
do
hold
in
ford
who
was
in
the
middle
promptly
seized
an
arm
of
each
of
his
cousins
while
frank
clambered
over
the
seat
to
help
him
they
were
all
down
on
the
bottom
now
serving
as
a
weight
to
hold
the
evergreen
branches
as
the
light
wagon
bounced
and
rattled
along
over
the
smooth
level
road
in
vain
dab
pulled
and
pulled
at
the
ponies
run
they
would
and
run
they
did
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
keep
them
fairly
in
the
road
bracing
strongly
back
with
the
reins
wound
around
his
tough
hands
and
with
a
look
in
his
face
that
should
have
given
courage
even
to
the
hart
boys
dab
strained
at
his
task
as
bravely
as
when
he
had
stood
at
the
tiller
of
the
swallow
in
the
storm
there
was
no
such
thing
as
stopping
those
ponies
and
now
as
they
whirled
along
even
dabney
face
paled
a
little
i
must
reach
the
bridge
before
he
does
he
just
stupid
enough
to
keep
right
on
it
was
very
stupid
indeed
for
the
driver
of
that
to
try
and
reach
the
little
narrow
unrailed
bridge
first
it
was
an
old
sort
of
a
bridge
at
best
dab
loosened
the
reins
a
little
but
could
not
use
his
whip
why
ca
he
stop
it
was
a
moment
of
breathless
anxiety
but
the
wagoner
kept
stolidly
on
there
would
be
barely
room
to
pass
him
on
the
road
itself
none
at
all
on
the
narrow
bridge
the
ponies
did
it
they
seemed
to
put
on
an
extra
touch
of
speed
on
their
own
account
just
then
there
was
a
rattle
a
faint
crash
and
then
as
the
wheels
of
the
two
vehicles
almost
touched
each
other
in
passing
ford
shouted
the
bridge
is
down
such
a
narrow
escape
one
of
the
rotten
girders
never
half
strong
enough
had
given
way
under
the
sudden
shock
of
the
hinder
wheels
and
that
would
have
to
find
its
road
across
the
brook
as
best
it
could
there
were
more
wagons
to
pass
as
they
plunged
forward
and
rough
places
in
the
road
for
dabney
to
look
out
for
but
even
joe
and
fuz
were
now
getting
confidence
in
their
driver
before
long
too
the
ponies
themselves
began
to
feel
that
they
had
had
enough
of
it
then
it
was
that
dab
used
his
whip
again
and
the
streets
of
the
village
were
traversed
at
a
rate
to
call
for
the
disapprobation
of
all
people
here
we
are
ham
greens
and
all
did
they
run
far
dab
asked
ham
quietly
chapter
xxiv
dabney
great
party
the
boys
returned
a
good
deal
earlier
than
anybody
had
expected
but
they
made
no
more
trouble
as
ford
foster
remarked
they
were
all
willing
to
go
slow
for
a
week
after
being
carried
home
at
such
a
rate
by
dab
ponies
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
too
about
the
runaway
and
foster
longed
to
see
dabney
and
thank
him
on
ford
account
but
he
himself
had
no
idea
that
he
had
done
any
thing
remarkable
and
was
very
busy
decking
miranda
parlors
with
the
evergreens
a
nice
appearance
they
made
too
all
those
woven
branches
and
clustered
sprays
when
they
were
in
place
and
samantha
declared
for
them
that
they
had
kept
dab
out
of
mischief
all
the
afternoon
at
an
early
hour
after
supper
the
guests
began
to
arrive
for
kinzer
was
a
woman
of
too
much
good
sense
to
have
night
turned
into
day
when
she
could
prevent
it
as
the
stream
of
visitors
steadily
poured
in
dab
remarked
to
jenny
walters
we
shall
have
to
enlarge
the
house
after
all
if
it
were
only
a
dress
now
what
then
why
you
could
just
let
out
the
tucks
i
had
to
do
that
with
mine
jenny
shake
hands
with
me
what
for
dabney
i
so
glad
to
meet
somebody
else
that
outgrowing
something
there
was
a
tinge
of
color
rising
in
jenny
face
but
before
she
could
think
of
any
thing
to
say
dab
added
there
jenny
there
foster
and
annie

sweet
one
of
the
nicest
old

to
them

jenny
walters
had
been
unusually
kindly
and
gracious
in
her
manner
that
evening
and
her
very
voice
had
less
than
its
accustomed
sharpness
but
her
natural
disposition
broke
out
a
little
some
minutes
later
while
she
was
talking
with
annie
foster
said
she
i
wanted
so
much
to
get
acquainted
with
you
with
me
yes
i
seen
you
in
church
and
i
heard
you
talked
about
and
i
wanted
to
find
out
for
myself
find
out
what
asked
annie
a
little
soberly
why
you
see
i
do
believe
it
possible
for
any
girl
to
be
as
sweet
as
you
look
i
could
i
know
i
been
trying
these
two
days
and
i
nearly
worn
out
annie
eyes
opened
wide
with
surprise
and
she
laughed
merrily
as
she
answered
what
can
you
mean
i
glad
enough
if
my
face
does
tell
tales
of
me
but
mine
does
said
jenny
and
then
i
so
sure
to
tell
all
the
rest
with
my
tongue
i
do
wish
i
knew
what
were
your
faults
my
faults
what
for
i
do
know
seems
to
me
if
i
could
think
of
your
faults
instead
of
mine
it
would
be
so
hard
to
look
sweet
annie
could
but
see
that
there
was
more
earnestness
than
fun
in
the
queer
talk
of
her
new
acquaintance
the
truth
was
that
jenny
had
been
having
almost
as
hard
a
struggle
with
her
tongue
as
dick
lee
with
his
though
not
for
the
same
reason
before
many
minutes
she
had
frankly
told
annie
all
about
it
and
she
could
not
have
done
that
if
she
had
not
somehow
felt
that
annie
sweetness
was
genuine
the
two
girls
were
sure
friends
after
that
much
to
the
surprise
of
dabney
kinzer
he
indeed
had
been
too
much
occupied
in
caring
for
all
his
guests
to
pay
especial
attention
to
any
one
of
them
his
mother
had
looked
after
him
again
and
again
with
eyes
brimful
of
pride
and
of
commendation
of
the
way
in
which
he
was
acquitting
himself
as
host
foster
herself
remarked
to
her
husband
who
had
now
arrived
do
you
see
that
who
would
have
expected
as
much
from
a
raw
green
country
boy
but
my
dear
do
you
see
the
secret
of
it
is
that
he
not
thinking
of
himself
at
all
he
only
anxious
that
his
friends
should
have
a
good
time
that
it
but
then
that
too
is
a
very
rare
thing
in
a
boy
of
his
age
dabney
exclaimed
the
lawyer
in
a
louder
tone
of
voice
foster
i
glad
you
found
room
the
house
half
large
enough
it
do
i
understand
your
ponies
ran
away
with
you
they
did
come
home
in
a
hurry
that
a
fact
but
nobody
was
hurt
i
fear
there
would
have
been
but
for
you
do
you
start
for
grantley
with
the
other
boys
tomorrow
of
course
dick
lee
and
i
need
some
one
to
take
care
of
us
we
never
have
travelled
so
far
before
on
land
you
mean
is
dick
here
came
and
looked
in
sir
but
he
got
scared
by
the
crowd
and
went
home
poor
fellow
i
do
wonder
well
we
will
all
do
what
we
can
for
him
poor
dick
lee
and
yet
if
dabney
kinzer
had
known
his
whereabouts
at
that
very
moment
he
would
half
have
envied
him
dick
mother
was
in
the
kitchen
helping
about
the
refreshments
but
she
had
not
left
home
until
she
had
compelled
her
son
to
dress
himself
in
his
best
white
shirt
red
necktie
shining
shoes
and
all
and
she
had
brought
him
with
her
almost
by
force
you
goodnuff
to
go
to
de
and
leab
yer
pore
mother
an
i
reckon
you
good
nuff
for
de
party
dick
had
actually
ventured
in
from
the
kitchen
through
the
and
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
back
parlor
where
few
would
look
how
his
heart
did
beat
as
he
gazed
upon
the
merry
gathering
a
large
part
of
whom
he
had
known
all
his
born
days
but
there
was
a
opening
from
that
upon
the
long
piazza
which
kinzer
had
added
to
the
old
morris
mansion
and
hand
was
on
the
knob
of
that
door
almost
before
he
knew
it
then
he
was
out
on
the
road
to
the
landing
and
in
five
minutes
more
he
was
vigorously
rowing
the
jenny
out
through
the
inlet
towards
the
bay
his
heart
was
not
beating
unpleasantly
any
longer
but
as
he
shot
out
from
the
narrow
passage
through
the
flags
and
saw
the
little
waves
laughing
in
the
cool
dim
starlight
he
suddenly
stopped
rowing
leaned
on
his
oars
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
exclaimed
dar
i
safe
now
i
ai
got
to
say
a
word
to
nobody
out
yer
wonder
i
ebber
git
back
from
de
an
ketch
fish
in
dis
yer
bay
sho
course
i
will
but
goin
awful
dab
kinzer
thought
he
had
never
before
known
jenny
walters
to
appear
so
well
as
she
looked
that
evening
and
he
must
have
been
right
for
good
foster
said
to
annie
what
a
pleasant
kindly
face
your
new
friend
has
you
must
ask
her
to
come
and
see
us
she
seems
to
be
quite
a
favorite
with
the
kinzers
have
you
known
dabney
long
annie
had
asked
of
jenny
a
little
before
that
ever
since
i
was
a
little
bit
of
a
girl
and
a
big
boy
seven
or
eight
years
old
pushed
me
into
the
snow
was
it
dabney
no
but
dabney
was
the
boy
that
pushed
him
in
for
doing
it
and
then
helped
me
up
dab
rubbed
his
face
with
snow
for
him
till
he
cried
just
like
him
exclaimed
annie
with
emphasis
i
should
think
his
friends
here
will
miss
him
indeed
they
will
said
jenny
and
then
she
seemed
disposed
to
be
quiet
for
a
while
the
party
could
not
last
forever
pleasant
as
it
was
and
by
the
time
his
duties
as
host
were
all
done
and
over
dabney
was
tired
enough
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
soundly
his
arms
were
lame
and
sore
from
the
strain
the
ponies
had
given
them
and
that
may
have
been
the
reason
why
he
dreamed
half
the
night
that
he
was
driving
runaway
teams
and
crashing
over
rickety
old
bridges
there
was
some
reason
for
that
but
why
was
it
that
every
one
of
his
no
matter
who
else
was
in
it
seemed
to
have
jenny
walters
and
annie
foster
smiling
at
him
from
the
back
seat
he
rose
later
than
usual
next
morning
and
the
house
was
all
in
its
customary
order
by
the
time
he
got
down
stairs
breakfast
was
ready
also
and
it
was
hardly
over
before
dab
great
new
trunk
was
brought
down
into
the
passage
by
a
couple
of
the
farmhands
it
an
hour
yet
to
said
ham
morris
but
we
might
as
well
get
ready
we
must
be
on
hand
in
time
what
a
long
hour
that
was
and
not
even
a
chance
given
to
dab
to
run
down
to
the
landing
for
a
look
at
the
jenny
and
the
swallow
his
mother
and
ham
and
miranda
and
the
girls
seemed
to
be
all
made
up
of
that
morning
mother
said
dab
what
is
it
my
dear
boy
that
it
exactly
if
you
say
boy
again
ham
morris
have
to
carry
me
to
the
cars
i
all
kind
o
wilted
now
then
they
all
laughed
and
before
they
got
through
laughing
they
all
cried
except
ham
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
drew
a
long
whistle
the
ponies
were
at
the
door
now
the
light
wagon
was
a
roomy
one
but
when
dab
trunk
had
been
put
in
there
was
barely
room
left
for
the
ladies
and
dab
and
ham
had
to
walk
to
the
station
i
kind
o
glad
of
it
said
dab
it
was
a
short
walk
and
a
silent
one
but
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
platform
dab
exclaimed
there
they
are
all
of
them
the
whole
party
why
the
platform
as
crowded
as
our
house
was
last
night
kinzer
and
her
daughters
were
already
the
centre
of
a
talkative
crowd
of
young
people
and
ford
foster
and
frank
harley
with
joe
and
fuz
hart
were
asking
what
had
become
of
dab
for
the
train
was
in
sight
a
moment
later
as
the
puffing
locomotive
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
the
conductor
stepped
out
on
the
platform
exclaiming
look
folks
this
ai
right
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
picnic
you
ought
to
have
sent
word
and
i
have
tacked
on
an
extra
car
have
to
pack
in
now
best
you
can
he
seemed
much
relieved
when
he
found
how
small
a
part
of
that
crowd
were
to
be
his
passengers
dab
said
ford
this
is
your
not
ours
you
have
to
make
a
speech
dab
did
want
to
say
something
but
he
had
just
kissed
his
sisters
and
his
mother
and
half
a
dozen
of
his
friends
had
followed
the
example
of
jenny
walters
and
then
foster
had
kissed
him
and
ham
morris
had
shaken
hands
with
him
and
dab
could
not
have
said
a
word
to
have
saved
his
life
speech
whispered
ford
mischievously
as
dab
stepped
upon
the
but
dick
lee
who
had
just
escaped
from
the
tremendous
hug
his
mother
had
given
him
and
had
got
his
breath
again
came
to
his
friend
relief
in
the
nick
of
time
dick
felt
as
he
afterwards
explained
that
he
must
shout
or
he
should
go
off
and
so
at
the
top
of
his
shrill
voice
he
shouted
hurrah
for
kinzer
dar
ai
no
better
feller
lef
long
shoah
and
then
amid
a
chorus
of
cheers
and
laughter
and
a
grand
waving
of
white
handkerchiefs
the
engine
gave
a
deep
hysterical
cough
and
hurried
the
train
away
three
homesteads
by
the
long
island
shore
were
lonely
enough
that
evening
and
they
were
all
likely
to
be
lonelier
still
before
they
got
fairly
accustomed
to
the
continued
absence
of
those
boys
it
was
well
understood
that
the
fosters
had
determined
to
prolong
their
summer
in
the
country
until
the
arrival
of
cold
weather
they
had
found
all
things
so
pleasant
and
the
kinzers
were
well
pleased
with
that
as
samantha
remarked
if
it
only
to
compare
letters
i
do
hope
dabney
will
write
as
soon
as
he
gets
there
and
tell
us
all
about
it
he
will
said
his
mother
but
ham
face
put
on
a
somewhat
doubtful
look
i
not
quite
sure
about
dab
he
said
slowly
if
things
ai
just
right
he
the
sort
of
boy
that
would
say
a
word
about
it
well
i
must
say
i
liked
what
i
saw
of
myers
notions
about
feeding
people
chapter
xxv
the
boys
on
their
travels
a
great
city
and
a
great
dinner
the
conductor
of
that
train
need
not
have
been
much
alarmed
at
falling
in
with
a
picnic
of
any
moderate
size
for
he
would
have
had
room
in
his
train
to
seat
a
good
part
of
it
at
least
the
boys
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
seats
all
together
that
is
they
found
four
empty
ones
two
on
each
side
right
opposite
and
when
they
had
turned
over
the
front
seats
there
they
were
ford
and
frank
were
facing
dabney
and
dick
on
the
right
and
the
two
hart
boys
were
facing
each
other
on
the
left
each
with
a
whole
seat
to
himself
almost
the
first
thing
joe
did
after
taking
possession
was
to
lean
over
and
whisper
look
out
fuz
keep
your
secret
catch
me
spoiling
a
good
joke
the
other
party
seemed
disposed
to
keep
pretty
quiet
for
a
while
the
first
break
of
any
consequence
in
the
silence
coming
when
ford
foster
exclaimed
dab
it
was
right
along
here
what
was
where
the
pig
had
his
collision
with
my
train
first
time
i
was
over
here
did
you
hear
him
squeal
asked
frank
as
he
peered
through
the
window
the
pig
no
but
you
ought
to
have
heard
the
engine
squeal
when
it
saw
him
coming
the
story
had
to
be
all
told
over
again
of
course
and
did
good
service
in
getting
their
thoughts
in
order
for
the
trip
before
them
up
to
the
mention
of
the
pig
it
had
somehow
seemed
to
dab
as
if
the
at
the
station
and
all
the
people
on
it
had
kept
company
with
the
train
and
frank
harley
found
himself
calculating
the
distance
between
that
car
and
the
mission
at
rangoon
in
india
as
for
ford
foster
he
stood
in
less
need
of
any
pig
than
the
rest
from
the
fact
that
he
had
a
idea
in
his
head
he
kept
it
there
too
until
that
train
pulled
up
within
reaching
distance
of
one
of
the
brooklyn
ferries
before
them
lay
the
swift
tide
of
the
broad
east
river
and
beyond
that
with
its
borders
of
crowded
docks
and
bristling
masts
lay
the
streets
and
squares
and
swarmed
the
multitudes
of
the
great
city
of
new
york
ford
said
dabney
you
captain
this
time
what
are
we
to
do
now
well
if
i
ai
captain
i
guess
i
better
do
a
little
steering
we
must
give
our
checks
to
the
expressman
and
have
our
luggage
carted
over
to
the
grand
central
depot
will
it
be
sure
to
get
there
in
good
time
of
course
it
would
if
we
were
in
any
hurry
but
our
train
leave
until
three
and
the
express
wo
fail
to
have
it
there
before
that
ford
was
all
alive
with
the
responsibilities
of
his
position
as
the
only
boy
in
the
party
who
had
been
born
in
the
city
and
had
travelled
all
over
it
and
a
little
out
of
it
joe
and
fuz
he
said
will
want
to
take
the
night
boat
for
albany
they
more
time
on
their
hands
than
we
have
joe
fuz
why
ca
you
come
along
with
us
after
you
checked
your
trunks
we
be
getting
dinner
before
long
the
hart
boys
promptly
assented
after
a
look
at
each
other
and
a
sort
of
chuckle
might
as
well
keep
together
said
joe
we
like
to
take
a
look
at
things
come
along
i
show
you
frank
harley
had
seen
quite
a
number
of
great
cities
and
he
could
hardly
help
saying
something
about
them
while
they
were
going
over
on
the
ferryboat
they
were
all
as
far
forward
as
they
could
get
did
you
ever
see
any
thing
just
like
this
asked
dab
well
no
not
just
like
it
in
india
or
in
china
or
in
london
or
in
africa
said
ford
it
a
little
different
from
any
thing
i
ever
saw
well
is
it
bigger
that
was
a
question
frank
might
have
undertaken
to
answer
if
there
had
been
proper
time
given
him
but
just
then
the
boat
was
running
into
her
slip
away
down
town
and
ford
exclaimed
hurrah
boys
now
for
fulton
market
and
some
oysters
oysters
said
dab
yes
sir
there
more
oysters
in
that
old
shanty
than
there
are
in
your
bay
i
do
know
about
that
said
dab
staring
at
the
queer
huge
rickety
old
mass
of
unsightly
wood
and
glass
that
ford
was
pointing
at
after
they
got
ashore
i
hungry
anyhow
hungry
so
am
i
but
no
man
ought
to
say
he
been
in
new
york
till
he
tried
some
oysters
let
take
raw
said
fuz
then
we
can
go
ahead
dick
lee
had
been
in
the
city
before
but
never
in
such
company
nor
in
such
very
good
clothes
and
there
was
an
expression
on
his
face
a
good
deal
like
awe
when
he
actually
found
himself
standing
at
an
in
line
with
five
young
white
boys
the
man
behind
the
counter
served
him
too
in
regular
turn
and
dick
felt
it
a
point
of
honor
to
empty
the
before
him
as
quickly
as
any
of
the
rest
there
was
no
delay
about
that
anywhere
along
that
line
of
boys
dick
said
ford
where
your
lemon
there
it
is
ford
had
already
explained
to
the
rest
that
it
was
against
the
constitution
and
of
fulton
market
to
eat
a
raw
oyster
without
the
and
dick
would
have
blushed
if
he
could
dat
so
i
forgot
um
and
then
he
added
with
great
care
yes
foster
the
lemon
improves
the
oyster
i
declare
muttered
ford
he
keeping
it
up
the
oysters
were
eaten
and
then
it
was
come
on
boys
and
away
they
went
up
fulton
street
to
broadway
they
walked
two
and
two
as
well
as
the
streams
of
people
would
let
them
but
the
hart
boys
kept
a
little
in
the
rear
what
do
you
think
of
it
joe
think
of
what
walking
over
new
york
with
dick
lee
just
as
if
he
was
one
of
us
guess
nobody
think
we
walking
with
him
anybody
can
tell
what
we
are
just
by
looking
at
us
dick
face
shows
just
what
he
is
too
i
do
care
for
this
once
but
it
awful
if
any
such
thought
were
troubling
ford
foster
he
made
no
confession
of
it
and
was
even
specially
careful
now
and
then
to
turn
around
and
address
some
remark
or
other
to
the
member
from
africa
as
he
called
him
dick
said
dab
in
an
undertone
as
they
were
leaving
the
market
you
look
out
now
you
must
have
as
good
a
time
as
any
of
us
or
i
feel
right
about
it
jes
you
sail
right
ahead
dab
i
on
hand
ford
was
determined
to
do
the
honors
and
he
led
them
down
broadway
to
the
battery
before
he
started
up
town
and
he
had
something
to
say
about
a
great
many
of
the
buildings
dab
felt
his
respect
for
city
boys
increasing
rapidly
and
dick
remarked
ef
he
do
know
dis
coas
mos
as
well
as
i
know
de
bay
it
looked
like
it
and
he
also
seemed
to
be
on
terms
of
easy
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
human
fish
they
fell
in
with
not
that
he
spoke
to
any
of
them
but
he
pointed
out
the
several
kinds
policemen
firemen
loafers
brokers
carriers
a
dozen
more
with
a
degree
of
confidence
which
fairly
astonished
his
friends
i
could
learn
to
tell
all
of
them
that
wear
uniforms
myself
said
dabney
but
how
do
you
know
the
others
how
do
i
know
well
it
just
like
knowing
a
miller
or
a
blacksmith
when
you
see
him
they
all
have
some
kind
of
smut
on
them
that
comes
from
their
trade
there
may
have
been
something
in
that
or
it
may
be
barely
possible
that
ford
now
and
then
mixed
his
men
a
little
and
pointed
out
brokers
as
gamblers
and
busy
attorneys
as
probable
pickpockets
he
may
have
been
too
confident
on
they
went
till
the
brains
of
all
but
ford
and
frank
were
in
a
sort
of
whirl
even
dab
kinzer
was
contented
to
look
without
talking
and
dick
lee
although
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
found
unusual
difficulty
in
keeping
his
mouth
shut
it
positively
would
come
open
every
time
ford
pointed
out
another
big
building
and
told
him
what
it
was
they
were
not
travelling
very
fast
but
they
were
using
a
good
deal
of
time
in
all
that
and
walking
is
hungry
business
and
a
few
raw
oysters
could
not
last
six
hearty
boys
very
long
i
say
ford
sung
out
joe
from
the
rear
is
it
getting
pretty
near
time
for
us
to
think
of
getting
something
to
eat
we
there
now
we
going
to
have
our
dinner
at
the
magnilophant
what
that
said
frank
never
heard
of
it
oh
you
the
member
from
india
well
it
the
greatest
restaurant
in
the
known
world
or
in
paris
either
beats
any
thing
on
long
island
serve
you
up
any
thing
there
is
and
no
living
man
can
tell
what
he
eating
ford
was
in
high
spirits
and
seemed
all
one
chuckle
of
it
was
indeed
a
remarkably
elegant
establishment
in
its
line
into
which
he
led
them
a
few
minutes
later
there
certainly
was
nothing
like
it
on
long
island
whatever
might
be
true
of
paris
and
other
places
outside
of
the
known
world
dab
kinzer
felt
like
walking
very
straight
as
he
followed
his
leader
and
dick
lee
had
to
use
all
the
strength
he
had
to
keep
himself
from
taking
his
hat
right
off
when
he
went
in
there
was
any
amount
of
glitter
and
shine
in
all
directions
and
dab
had
a
confused
idea
that
he
had
never
before
believed
that
the
world
contained
so
many
tables
ford
seemed
wonderfully
at
home
and
at
ease
and
dick
found
voice
enough
to
say
half
aloud
ai
i
glad
he
got
de
rudder
dis
time
dab
could
steer
dis
yer
the
steering
was
well
done
and
it
brought
them
nearly
to
the
farther
end
of
the
great
splendid
room
and
seated
them
at
a
round
table
that
seemed
as
well
furnished
as
even
foster
own
they
all
imitated
ford
in
hanging
their
hats
on
the
appointed
pegs
before
sitting
down
now
boys
what
shall
we
have
he
said
as
he
gazed
learnedly
up
and
down
the
printed
bill
of
fare
speak
up
joe
fuz
what
your
weakness
every
boy
of
them
was
willing
to
let
ford
do
his
best
with
that
part
of
the
dinner
and
he
was
hard
at
work
deciding
what
soup
and
fish
he
had
better
pick
out
when
the
tall
waiter
who
had
bustled
forward
to
receive
the
coming
order
bent
over
his
shoulder
and
pointed
to
dick
lee
inquiring
beg
pardon
sah
is
dis
young
colored
of
youah
party
de
rules
ob
de
establishment
sah
dab
kinzer
felt
his
face
flush
fiery
red
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
he
hardly
knew
what
when
ford
looked
calmly
up
into
the
mahogany
face
of
the
mulatto
waiter
with
you
refer
to
my
friend
from
africa
we
talk
about
that
after
dinner
gumbo
soup
and
spanish
mackerel
if
you
please
sharp
now
but
sah
do
be
afflicted
my
friend
he
as
white
as
anybody
except
on
fridays
this
is
his
black
day
hurry
up
the
soup
and
fish
joe
and
fuz
were
looking
as
if
they
were
dreadfully
ashamed
of
something
but
poor
dick
was
sitting
up
as
straight
as
a
ramrod
under
the
influence
of
a
glance
that
he
had
taken
at
the
face
of
dab
kinzer
i
is
goin
back
on
him
and
ford
he
said
to
himself
i
foller
dem
fellers
right
fru
dis
yer
frank
harley
seemed
to
be
getting
some
information
in
the
country
he
had
lived
in
nearly
all
his
life
colored
people
were
as
good
as
anybody
if
they
were
of
the
right
sort
and
a
man
skin
had
little
to
do
with
the
degree
of
respect
paid
him
although
even
there
it
was
an
excellent
thing
to
be
white
as
for
the
mulatto
waiter
after
a
moment
more
of
hesitation
he
took
ford
order
and
walked
dignifiedly
away
muttering
nebber
seen
de
like
afore
reckon
i
is
to
tote
soup
and
fish
for
no
nigger
i
see
de
boss
that
meant
an
appeal
to
the
lordly
and
pompous
but
quite
gentlemanly
head
waiter
a
man
as
white
as
ford
foster
a
word
or
two
to
him
a
finger
pointed
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
and
the
keen
eyes
of
the
man
in
authority
took
it
all
in
six
of
them
five
white
and
one
black
well
gus
do
they
look
as
if
they
could
pay
their
bill
before
they
go
yes

in

he

sah
well
then
gus
you
just
tramp
right
along
if
he
and
the
rest
care
i
do
it
be
time
enough
for
me
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
when
somebody
offers
to
pay
me
for
it
give
their
dinner
sharp
it
jes
a
outrage
growled
the
offended
waiter
as
he
stalked
away
but
he
took
good
care
to
obey
his
orders
for
he
had
a
consciousness
that
the
eyes
of
his
master
were
on
him
he
could
hardly
have
guessed
how
completely
his
errand
had
been
understood
by
the
six
boys
or
how
closely
ford
foster
had
hit
it
said
he
in
reply
to
an
angry
remark
from
dab
kinzer
it
all
humbug
they
run
this
concern
to
make
money
and
they
want
some
of
ours
marigold
be
sent
right
back
with
our
soup
he
was
right
but
before
they
had
eaten
their
way
to
the
pie
and
pudding
ford
was
dignifiedly
informed
if
you
please
sah
my
name
is
marigold
sah
it
is
bellerington
sah
an
my
first
name
is
coffee
sah
it
augustus
you
do
say
replied
ford
well
augustus
do
forget
the
little
remark
i
made
about
pie
and
the
other
things
it
was
a
capital
dinner
and
ford
was
proud
of
it
for
he
had
picked
out
every
item
of
it
from
the
soup
to
the
macaroons
dick
lee
had
enjoyed
it
hugely
after
he
began
to
feel
that
his
first
social
victory
had
been
fairly
won
for
him
still
he
had
doubts
in
his
own
mind
as
to
whether
he
would
ever
dare
such
another
undertaking
with
less
than
five
white
boys
along
to
see
him
through
joe
and
fuz
ate
well
but
their
spirits
were
manifestly
low
for
they
were
painfully
conscious
of
having
forever
lost
the
good
opinion
of
that
mulatto
waiter
but
for
dick
lee
being
with
us
they
thought
he
and
everybody
else
would
have
known
we
were
gentlemen
we
never
be
caught
in
such
a
trap
again
it
is
a
very
sad
matter
no
doubt
to
lose
the
intelligent
respect
of
such
gentlemen
as
augustus
bellerington
but
it
sometimes
has
to
be
done
that
is
unless
their
good
opinion
is
to
be
gained
by
some
nice
little
stroke
of
sneaking
cowardice
joe
and
fuz
stood
it
out
indeed
mainly
because
they
were
in
some
way
more
afraid
of
dab
and
ford
and
frank
than
they
were
of
even
augustus
that
too
was
strange
for
they
were
older
than
either
of
the
others
and
taller
than
any
but
dabney
himself
the
dinner
was
well
eaten
and
it
was
well
paid
for
as
dabney
remarked
when
he
paid
his
share
and
half
of
dick
and
then
they
were
all
in
the
street
again
marching
along
and
towards
the
grand
central
railroad
depot
chapter
xxvi
the
first
morning
in
grantley
and
another
excellent
joke
ford
foster
was
the
only
one
of
those
six
boys
who
had
ever
seen
the
great
and
he
confessed
that
it
looked
a
little
large
even
to
him
frank
harley
freely
declared
that
he
had
seen
nothing
like
it
in
india
and
dick
lee
eyes
showed
all
the
white
they
had
to
show
before
he
had
seen
the
whole
of
it
their
first
errand
was
to
the
and
they
were
on
their
way
when
dab
kinzer
thoughtfully
remarked
now
joe
here
we
dragged
you
and
fuz
away
up
here
miles
and
miles
out
of
your
way
that
so
said
ford
but
they
can
take
a
down
got
hours
of
time
to
spare
no
hurry
said
joe
we
see
you
off
but
fuz
whispered
to
him
time
up
joe
joke
got
to
come
out
now
it
came
out
at
the
for
there
were
the
trunks
of
the
hart
boys
and
they
had
to
go
with
the
others
to
the
for
their
tickets
before
they
could
get
their
checks
do
you
mean
you
to
go
right
on
now
with
us
said
ford
in
some
astonishment
i
thought
you
were
going
home
first
no
we
got
a
letter
three
days
ago
telling
us
what
to
do
our
other
things
be
sent
on
by
express
the
joke
was
out
and
the
two
jokers
were
laughing
as
though
it
were
a
remarkably
good
one
in
their
estimation
but
ford
nodded
his
head
approvingly
uncle
joseph
is
a
wise
and
careful
man
about
his
children
he
said
slowly
he
did
mean
you
should
make
the
trip
alone
i
much
obliged
to
him
for
such
an
expression
of
his
confidence
in
me
the
laugh
somehow
died
away
as
if
a
sudden
fit
of
sickness
had
carried
it
off
while
a
broad
smile
widened
on
the
faces
of
the
other
boys
notably
including
dick
lee
but
the
were
to
be
looked
after
and
there
were
seats
in
the
to
be
secured
the
lost
joke
could
hide
itself
easily
in
all
that
hurry
and
excitement
the
sleeper
carry
us
the
best
part
of
the
way
said
ford
when
at
last
they
took
their
seats
but
we
have
a
doleful
little
ride
on
a
small
railway
early
in
the
morning
but
that
take
us
right
up
north
to
grantley
added
dab
with
a
breath
of
expectation
the
remaining
hours
of
that
friday
were
largely
spent
by
all
six
of
them
in
looking
out
of
the
windows
when
they
were
not
doing
that
it
was
mostly
because
joe
or
fuz
was
telling
some
yarn
or
other
about
grantley
and
its
academy
they
agreed
perfectly
in
their
somewhat
extravagant
praise
of
myers
and
her
daughter
almira
she
such
a
good
liberal
motherly
woman
said
joe
and
almira
a
sweet
young
lady
added
fuz
only
she
a
little
timid
about
boys
need
be
afraid
of
us
i
guess
said
ford
foster
with
a
benevolent
and
protecting
expression
on
his
face
while
dab
drew
a
mental
picture
of
the
fair
almira
as
a
sort
of
copy
of
annie
foster
after
the
darkness
came
and
the
sleeper
was
turned
into
a
great
full
of
little
shaky
bedrooms
there
was
no
more
talking
to
be
done
and
all
the
boys
were
tired
enough
to
go
to
sleep
one
consequence
of
their
beginning
their
slumbers
so
early
however
was
that
they
felt
bright
and
fresh
when
the
porter
aroused
them
before
daylight
next
morning
and
they
hurriedly
dressed
themselves
for
their
ride
on
what
ford
foster
called
the
switch
it
was
quite
a
respectable
railway
however
and
it
carried
them
through
scenery
so
different
from
any
that
dabney
or
dick
was
accustomed
to
that
they
lost
a
good
deal
of
what
joe
and
fuz
were
saying
about
abiram
brandegee
the
learned
principal
of
grantley
academy
it
was
of
less
importance
perhaps
because
they
had
heard
it
all
before
and
had
gathered
a
curious
collection
of
ideas
concerning
the
man
under
whose
direction
they
were
to
get
their
new
stocks
of
learning
dab
said
dick
if
it
was
any
fellers
but
them
said
it
i
want
to
go
home
well
yes
said
dab
quietly
but
then
that
just
it
you
guess
when
they
telling
the
truth
and
when
they
ai
is
dar
really
any
fun
in
lyin
do
you
dab
ca
say
dick
guess
there
would
be
much
for
you
or
me
dar
lots
ob
fun
in
ford
an
he
tells
de
truth
mos
all
de
time
stiddy
so
does
frank
jes
a
little
bit
stiddier
ford
never
lies
dick
no
sir
he
do
but
anoder
feller
lyin
he
kin
make
believe
he
do
know
it
bes
of
any
feller
i
ebber
seen
dick
exclaimed
dabney
what
if
brandegee
had
heard
you
say
that
i
would
tell
him
i
was
imitating
somebody
i
had
heard
solemnly
responded
dick
with
fair
correctness
the
ride
began
in
the
dark
hour
that
comes
before
the
dawn
and
the
train
ran
fast
the
sun
was
above
the
horizon
but
had
not
yet
peered
over
the
high
hills
around
grantley
when
the
excited
schoolboys
were
landed
at
the
little
station
in
the
outskirts
of
the
village
it
was
on
a
hillside
and
they
could
almost
look
down
upon
a
large
part
of
the
scene
of
their
good
time
coming
or
their
bad
time
a
good
deal
as
they
themselves
might
make
it
dab
and
his
friends
saw
that
valley
and
village
often
enough
afterwards
but
never
again
did
it
wear
to
them
precisely
the
same
look
it
put
on
that
morning
in
the
growing
light
of
that
noble
september
day
as
for
joe
and
fuz
it
was
all
an
old
story
to
them
and
what
was
more
they
had
another
joke
on
hand
there
the
academy
said
joe
that
big
white
concern
in
the
middle
of
the
green
and
with
so
short
a
steeple
steeple
enough
said
ford
are
the
rest
churches
yes
and
if
you
do
go
to
church
old
by
be
sure
to
hear
of
it
old
by
was
the
irreverent
nickname
they
had
selected
for
abiram
brandegee
and
fuz
added
never
mind
him
boys
he
a
raspy
old
fellow
but
he
such
a
little
old
withered
wisp
of
a
chap
you
soon
get
used
to
him
dab
was
bewildered
enough
just
then
to
wonder
how
such
a
malicious
old
dwarf
as
had
been
painted
to
him
could
have
managed
to
get
and
keep
so
high
a
position
in
so
remarkably
beautiful
a
place
as
grantley
he
said
something
about
the
village
being
so
pretty
but
dick
lee
had
been
staring
eagerly
in
all
directions
and
replied
with
jes
one
little
mite
of
a
patch
ob
water
is
dar
any
fish
to
ketch
fish
in
that
pond
said
fuz
why
it
alive
with
the
people
of
grantley
just
live
on
fish
guess
i
knows
how
many
dey
is
now
said
dick
soberly
and
he
was
not
far
from
right
for
there
were
no
fish
to
speak
of
in
that
myers
will
hardly
be
up
so
early
as
this
said
dab
we
can
get
our
trunks
over
by
and
by
let
have
a
look
at
the
village
joe
your
turn
to
steer
now
you
and
fuz
know
how
the
land
lies
they
were
ready
enough
to
tell
all
they
knew
and
a
good
deal
more
but
the
listeners
they
had
that
morning
were
not
without
eyes
of
their
own
and
it
was
not
a
very
fatiguing
task
to
walk
all
over
the
village
of
grantley
the
first
house
to
be
studied
with
special
care
was
the
neat
white
residence
of
brandegee
with
its
shady
trees
and
its
garden
for
joe
said
that
where
you
fellows
have
to
come
right
after
breakfast
to
be
examined
oh
but
wo
old
by
put
you
through
dick
lee
mouth
came
open
as
he
stared
at
the
knob
on
the
front
door
and
dabney
caught
himself
doubting
if
he
knew
the
even
ford
foster
wondered
if
there
was
really
any
thing
he
could
teach
brandegee
and
remarked
to
frank
harley
i
you
about
the
only
man
among
us
that
he
ca
corner
how
that
why
if
he
too
hard
on
you
you
can
answer
him
in
hindustanee
never
been
a
heathen
in
all
his
life
you
have
him
shuah
chuckled
dick
the
green
was
large
and
and
looked
like
the
best
kind
of
a
but
there
was
nothing
wonderful
about
the
academy
building
except
that
it
evidently
had
in
it
room
enough
for
a
great
many
boys
you
see
enough
of
it
before
you
get
through
said
fuz
but
there
have
to
be
lots
of
whittling
done
this
fall
whittling
what
for
why
do
you
see
they
gone
and
painted
the
old
thing
all
over
new
every
boy
cut
his
name
somewhere
before
we
left
last
term
all
painted
over
now
maybe
they
puttied
up
level
they
did
that
once
before
and
we
had
to
cut
all
out
again
oh
said
ford
i
see
you
were
afraid
they
forget
you
i
believe
they
would
you
have
pointed
out
myers
said
dabney
it
must
be
pretty
near
where
is
it
the
hart
boys
broke
out
into
a
joint
giggle
of
enjoyment
as
joe
responded
there
it
is
right
across
there
beyond
the
opposite
the
other
end
of
the
green
handy
in
bad
weather
it
a
pretty
house
too
said
ford

let
go
over
and
let
her
know
we

in
port
well

said
joe

fuz
and
i
wo
take
our
breakfast
there
this
morning
going
somewhere
else
eh
well
we
have
an
eye
to
your
trunks
when
they
come
the
giggle
grew
rapidly
into
a
laugh
as
fuz
exclaimed
trunks
why
our
baggage

to
our
we
do
put
up
with
mother
myers
this
time
got
a
new
place
oh
but
wo
you
fellows
just
love
her
and
almira
it
was
all
out
that
deep
secret
about
their
change
of
and
the
hart
boys
had
something
to
enjoy
this
time
for
dab
and
his
friends
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
blank
amazement
all
right
boys
shouted
ford
at
the
end
of
it
here
for
some
breakfast
joe
fuz
see
you
again
by
and
by
they
all
followed
him
but
they
could
see
that
there
was
something
more
hidden
under
the
mirth
of
joe
and
fuz
as
they
walked
away
and
they
were
hardly
out
of
hearing
before
dab
kinzer
remarked
look
a
here
boys
i
move
we
do
give
those
two
any
fun
at
our
expense
how
asked
ford
if
there
any
thing
at
myers
that
we
do
like
we
must
let
them
know
it
i
keep
my
mouf
shet
if
i
foun
de
house
was
an
ole
said
dick
emphatically
and
frank
and
ford
came
out
even
more
strongly
they
all
seemed
to
feel
as
if
some
kind
of
a
trick
had
been
played
upon
them
to
begin
with
however
it
served
to
put
them
on
their
guard
and
prevented
any
change
of
countenance
among
them
when
their
knock
at
the
front
door
of
that
house
was
answered
and
the
freckled
face
of
myers
beamed
out
upon
them
from
under
its
thin
smooth
glistening
thatch
of
carroty
hair
she
was
not
a
handsome
woman
and
she
had
a
thin
nose
and
a
narrow
mouth
and
very
pale
blue
eyes
but
she
was
all
one
smile
of
welcome
as
she
stood
in
that
doorway
mrs
myers
said
ford
with
an
extraordinary
bow
we
arrived
on
the
morning
train
i
am
mr
foster
and
then
with
a
half
turn
to
the
right
he
continued
myers
richard
lee
dabney
kinzer
francis
harley
our
baggage
will
come
over
pretty
soon
walk
in
young
gentlemen
walk
in
i
happy
to
see
almira
here
they
are
put
breakfast
on
the
table
right
away
that
is
a
bad
beginning
thought
dab
that
sounds
a
good
deal
like
what
ham
said
of
her
she
knew
we
must
be
hungry
walk
into
the
parlor
please
breakfast
be
ready
in
one
minute
show
you
your
rooms
afterwards
that
too
was
considerate
and
when
almira
herself
came
to
the
door
between
the
parlor
and
the
she
too
looked
as
if
it
were
quite
her
habit
to
smile
when
she
said
breakfast
ready
almira
smiled
but
she
was
too
much
like
her
mother
there
was
nothing
at
all
about
her
to
put
dabney
in
mind
of
annie
foster
or
of
either
of
his
own
sisters
samantha
or
keziah
or
pamela
could
have
been
made
over
into
two
almiras
in
every
thing
but
height
and
dab
made
up
his
mind
at
once
that
either
of
them
could
beat
her
at
smiling
not
so
much
perhaps
as
to
mere
quantity
but
as
to
quality
that
was
a
breakfast
which
would
have
fully
justified
ham
report
for
it
was
well
cooked
and
plentiful
the
johnnycake
in
particular
was
abundant
and
all
the
boys
took
to
it
kindly
glad
you
like
it
said
myers
almira
that
one
thing
we
must
forget
i
was
always
proud
of
my
johnny
cake
there
very
few
know
what
to
do
with
their
after
they
got
it
she
did
evidently
and
the
boys
all
said
so
except
dick
lee
he
could
do
full
justice
to
his
breakfast
indeed
but
he
was
saying
to
himself
all
the
while
i
i
ebber
git
used
to
dis
yer
it
jes
awful
dis
to
de
chapter
xxvii
a
new
kind
of
examination
three
large
trunks
and
one
small
one
were
delivered
at
front
door
before
that
first
breakfast
was
disposed
of
and
miss
almira
remarked
of
the
boys
a
few
minutes
later
how
strong
they
are
especially
mr
kinzer
do
make
a
mistake
almira
said
her
mother
in
an
undertone
glad
the
trunks
are
up
stairs
but
we
must
begin
by
saying
to
them
i
got
all
their
first
names
they
must
get
it
into
their
heads
that
they
any
thing
more
just
so
many
boys
she
hurried
up
stairs
however
and
it
did
not
take
long
to
make
her
new
boarders
know
their
places
so
far
as
their
rooms
were
concerned
that
house
was
largely
made
up
of
its
one
wing
on
the
first
floor
of
which
was
the
and
all
in
one
in
the
second
story
of
it
were
two
bedrooms
opening
into
each
other
the
first
and
larger
one
was
assigned
to
dab
and
ford
and
the
inner
one
to
frank
yours
is
a
coop
said
ford
to
his
friend
from
india
but
ours
is
big
enough
you
can
come
in
here
to
study
and
we
fix
it
up
prime
the
stove
a
queer
one
guess
they
burn
wood
up
here
mostly
of
course
so
long
as
there
was
a
good
on
the
outlying
farm
that
belonged
to
hart
speculation
the
stove
was
a
little
box
of
an
affair
with
two
griddles
on
top
and
was
quite
capable
of
warming
that
floor
she
putting
dick
away
in
back
somewhere
said
frank
we
must
look
and
see
what
she
done
for
him
the
main
building
of
that
house
was
only
big
enough
for
a
hall
a
parlor
opening
into
it
on
the
right
a
bedroom
and
large
closet
back
of
that
and
two
rooms
overhead
but
the
kitchen
and
back
which
must
have
been
stuck
on
at
a
later
day
had
only
one
wide
low
garret
of
a
room
in
the
space
under
the
roof
it
was
lighted
by
a
dormer
window
and
it
did
not
contain
any
stove
the
floor
was
bare
except
in
the
spot
covered
by
an
old
rug
before
the
little
narrow
bed
but
there
was
a
table
and
a
chair
by
standing
on
either
of
which
dick
would
be
able
to
put
his
hand
upon
the
unceiled
rafters
and
boards
of
the
roof
on
the
whole
it
was
a
room
well
calculated
to
be
as
hot
as
possible
in
summer
and
as
cold
as
possible
in
winter
but
that
would
do
very
well
in
spring
and
autumn
at
all
events
it
was
as
good
as
he
had
been
used
to
at
home
myers
herself
said
that
to
almira
and
the
answer
was
guess
it
is
and
better
too
dick
never
dreamed
of
making
any
criticisms
in
fact
his
young
brains
were
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
through
the
dust
of
which
every
thing
in
and
about
grantley
took
on
a
wonderfully
rosy
color
dis
room
he
said
to
his
inquiring
friends
when
they
looked
in
on
him
how
does
i
like
dis
room
it
de
bes
room
in
de
house
i
shall
study
hard
in
this
room
bully
for
you
said
ford
but
you
must
forget
there
a
stove
in
our
room
when
cold
weather
comes
got
your
books
out
here
they
are
i
will
pile
them
upon
the
table
stick
to
it
dick
said
ford
but
it
about
time
we
set
out
for
dr
dab
had
we
better
kindle
a
fire
before
we
go
it
makes
me
feel
chilly
to
think
of
it
we
all
be
warm
enough
before
he
gets
through
with
us
said
dab
but
the
sooner
we
get
there
the
better
maybe
there
are
other
boys
and
we
must
go
in
first
come
on
dick
not
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry
in
spite
of
dab
prudent
suggestion
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
they
were
met
by
myers
going
for
your
examination
that
right
dinner
be
ready
at
twelve
when
school
opened
it
will
be
a
few
minutes
earlier
so
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
eat
and
get
back
dick
as
soon
as
your
examination
over
i
want
you
to
come
right
back
here
so
i
can
finish
making
my
arrangement
with
you
yes
i
will
return
at
once
you
said
that
said
dab
the
moment
they
were
on
the
sidewalk
but
i
ca
guess
what
she
means
ham
morris
made
all
the
bargain
for
you
when
he
settled
for
me
it
all
right
though
course
it
is
i
got
to
work
out
half
my
board
chores
wot
i
been
used
to
all
my
life
frank
harley
had
seen
a
great
many
people
considering
how
young
he
was
and
he
had
done
less
talking
than
the
rest
that
morning
and
more
studying
of
his
landlady
and
her
daughter
the
results
of
it
came
out
now
tell
you
what
boys
if
i
not
mistaken
dick
lee
pay
more
for
his
board
than
we
will
for
ours
i
do
care
said
dick
bravely
it
wuff
a
good
deal
to
feed
a
boy
like
me
his
mother
had
told
him
so
many
a
time
and
in
that
matter
glorianna
had
not
been
so
far
from
the
truth
ham
morris
had
indeed
made
a
careful
and
particular
bargain
for
dick
and
that
his
duties
about
the
house
should
not
interfere
with
his
studies
he
had
done
more
for
he
had
insisted
on
buying
for
him
and
had
made
him
promise
to
write
to
him
about
the
way
things
went
at
grantley
up
the
street
marched
the
four
new
boys
still
a
little
slowly
until
ford
broke
out
into
a
sudden
word
of
encouragement
look
here
boys
we
a
set
of
i
like
to
know
if
we
need
be
afraid
of
any
thing
joe
and
fuz
hart
could
go
through
well
i
guess
not
replied
dab
let
push
ahead
he
found
himself
leading
the
procession
when
it
went
through
brandegee
front
gate
and
there
was
a
look
of
admiration
on
face
when
he
saw
how
promptly
and
courageously
captain
dab
kinzer
pulled
that
this
way
please
said
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
into
the
library
the
doctor
see
you
in
a
minute
and
we
see
him
muttered
ford
as
they
walked
in
and
he
added
in
a
whisper
to
dick
that
his
portrait
there
over
the
mantel
jes
so
said
dick
coming
dangerously
near
smiling
an
his
name
den
was
oliver
cromwell
an
dey
dressed
him
up
in
sheet
iron
that
was
the
name
printed
under
the
engraving
but
the
smile
had
barely
time
to
fade
from
dick
face
before
a
door
opened
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
and
the
dreaded
principal
of
grantley
academy
walked
in
my
young
friends
glad
to
see
you
so
early
his
hand
was
out
towards
dick
lee
as
he
spoke
and
they
all
had
what
ford
afterwards
called
a
good
square
shake
of
it
by
the
time
they
recovered
their
tongues
and
replied
to
that
genial
hearty
encouraging
welcome
dick
could
have
helped
it
if
he
had
tried
and
he
somehow
forgot
to
try
a
broad
grin
of
delight
spread
all
over
his
face
as
he
looked
up
in
that
of
the
doctor
the
latter
himself
was
smiling
a
good
deal
as
if
he
could
not
help
it
but
he
did
not
know
the
exact
reason
why
every
one
of
those
boys
looked
so
cheerful
just
then
the
thought
in
ford
mind
came
within
an
inch
of
getting
out
over
his
tongue
dwarf
why
he
more
like
a
giant
how
joe
and
fuz
hart
did
spin
it
the
great
man
was
certainly
a
good
six
feet
two
and
all
his
bodily
proportions
were
correspondingly
ample
frank
harley
was
the
last
to
be
shaken
hands
with
and
so
had
time
to
think
afraid
of
him
why
he
too
big
to
be
afraid
of
we
all
right
that
was
the
whole
truth
brandegee
was
too
big
in
mind
as
well
as
body
for
any
boy
of
their
size
to
feel
at
all
uneasy
after
the
first
of
looking
in
his
calm
broad
thoughtful
face
every
member
of
that
quartet
began
to
feel
a
queer
sort
of
impatience
to
tell
all
he
knew
about
books
the
doctor
mentioned
the
fact
that
he
had
that
morning
received
letters
from
their
parents
and
friends
announcing
their
arrival
but
the
oddity
of
it
was
that
he
seemed
to
know
at
sight
the
right
name
for
each
boy
and
the
right
boy
for
each
name
he
might
have
guessed
at
dick
thought
ford
but
how
did
he
know
me
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
century
spent
in
receiving
classifying
and
managing
young
gentlemen
of
all
sorts
had
given
the
man
of
learning
special
faculties
for
his
work
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
my
young
friends
but
i
think
there
will
be
little
difficulty
in
assigning
you
your
places
and
studies
be
seated
please
that
library
was
plainly
a
place
where
no
time
was
to
be
wasted
for
in
less
than
a
minute
more
ford
foster
was
suddenly
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
passage
of
easy
latin
that
will
do
give
me
a
free
translation
ford
did
so
glibly
enough
but
there
followed
no
word
of
comment
favorable
or
otherwise
similar
brief
glimpses
were
taken
of
three
or
four
other
studies
and
then
the
doctor
suddenly
remarked
to
him
in
french
your
father
has
written
me
very
fully
concerning
your
previous
studies
you
are
well
prepared
but
you
have
plenty
of
hard
work
before
you
ford
fairly
strained
his
best
french
in
the
reply
he
made
and
the
doctor
observed
i
see
constant
practice
i
wish
more
parents
would
be
as
mr
harley
i
had
not
been
informed
that
you
spoke
french
you
noticed
foster
mistake
please
correct
it
for
him
frank
blushed
to
his
eyes
but
he
obeyed
and
he
hardly
knew
how
it
was
that
before
the
doctor
rapid
questioning
was
over
his
answers
had
included
the
whole
range
of
his
schooling
and
acquirements
is
dey
doin
fine
was
the
proud
thought
in
the
mind
of
dick
lee
but
jes
wait
till
he
gits
hol
ob
dab
dick
confidence
in
his
friend
was
at
least
ten
times
greater
than
dabney
in
himself
the
very
air
of
the
room
he
was
in
seemed
to
the
latter
to
grow
oppressively
heavy
with
learning
and
he
dreaded
his
own
turn
more
than
ever
while
he
was
waiting
for
it
to
come
however
some
casual
reference
to
long
island
by
the
doctor
and
a
question
as
to
the
precise
character
of
its
southern
coast
rapidly
expanded
into
a
wider
range
of
geography
upon
the
heels
of
which
history
trod
a
little
carelessly
and
other
subjects
came
tumbling
in
until
dabney
discovered
that
he
was
computing
at
the
doctor
request
sundry
arithmetical
results
which
might
with
greater
propriety
have
been
reserved
for
his
examination
that
too
was
the
way
poor
dick
lee
came
to
make
so
bad
a
breakdown
his
shining
face
would
have
told
even
to
eyes
less
practised
than
those
of
brandegee
exactly
the
answer
as
to
kind
and
readiness
which
he
would
have
made
to
every
question
put
to
his
white
friends
that
is
unless
he
had
been
directly
called
upon
to
answer
out
aloud
there
is
no
telling
what
he
would
have
done
in
such
a
case
as
that
the
doctor
found
out
for
he
quietly
shifted
his
last
question
over
dab
left
shoulder
and
let
it
fall
upon
dick
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
scare
him
you
got
me
dis
time
dat
de
berry
place
whar
we
stopped
at
de
end
of
our
school
las
year
then
i
think
i
know
about
where
it
best
for
you
to
begin
i
have
another
talk
with
you
about
it
richard
you
must
come
up
and
see
me
again
it
was
not
a
great
deal
to
say
but
the
way
in
which
he
said
it
plainly
added
i
mean
to
be
your
friend
my
dear
boy
i
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
along
dick
understood
it
too
but
he
was
feeling
dolefully
about
his
tongue
just
then
missed
fire
de
fust
time
he
said
to
himself
but
he
carefully
replied
aloud
thank
you
sir
will
you
tell
me
when
to
come
right
away
after
tea
now
young
gentlemen
i
must
bid
you
bear
in
mind
that
the
first
law
of
grantley
academy
is
punctuality
i
expect
you
to
be
in
your
places
promptly
at
nine
monday
morning
we
will
sir
said
dabney
but
will
you
please
tell
us
when
we
are
to
be
examined
i
believe
kinzer
i
have
a
fair
idea
of
the
use
you
have
made
of
your
books
up
to
this
time
no
further
examination
will
be
necessary
i
will
see
you
all
with
others
after
school
is
opened
next
monday
they
were
politely
shown
out
of
the
library
but
they
did
not
clearly
comprehend
the
matter
until
they
had
drawn
each
a
good
long
breath
in
the
open
air
dab
said
ford
ca
you
see
it
i
beginning
to
seems
to
me
we
been
through
the
sharpest
examination
i
ever
heard
of
i
say
frank
do
you
know
any
thing
he
did
make
you
tell
him
nothing
but
hindustanee
and
a
little
teloogoo
well
yes
i
know
a
karen
hymn
he
got
all
the
rest
if
i
not
mistaken
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
but
what
brandegee
had
gained
a
correct
view
of
the
attainments
of
his
new
pupils
chapter
xxviii
an
unusual
amount
of
introduction
the
front
door
of
brandegee
library
had
hardly
closed
behind
that
earliest
flock
of
his
autumn
birds
before
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
swung
open
and
a
matron
stood
in
it
remarking
my
dear
there
are
more
than
a
dozen
waiting
in
the
parlor
have
you
not
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
on
those
four
they
worth
it
mary
there
enough
in
every
one
of
them
to
make
a
man
of
and
they
all
started
fairly
well
i
fear
that
is
more
than
you
will
be
able
to
say
of
all
these
others
of
course
it
will
their
fathers
and
mothers
have
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
that
they
were
all
examined
however
in
due
season
some
in
one
way
and
some
in
another
and
during
all
that
time
dab
kinzer
and
his
friends
were
inwardly
wondering
whether
they
said
so
or
not
precisely
what
impression
they
had
made
upon
the
doctor
it
was
just
as
well
every
way
that
they
did
not
know
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
with
one
accord
they
accompanied
dick
on
his
return
to
their
and
while
he
disappeared
through
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
with
miss
almira
some
invisible
dragged
them
up
stairs
not
that
they
really
had
any
studying
to
do
but
it
was
before
they
had
finished
turning
over
the
leaves
of
their
and
estimating
the
amount
of
hard
work
it
would
cost
to
prepare
for
an
examination
on
them
there
was
no
good
reason
for
complaint
of
that
dinner
any
more
than
of
their
breakfast
and
it
wound
up
with
a
very
excellent
pudding
concerning
which
dabney
went
so
far
as
to
say
he
would
like
to
send
the
recipe
home
to
his
mother
i
so
glad
you
like
it
said
myers
almira
just
remember
that
they
can
have
it
as
often
as
they
please
she
asked
them
too
how
they
proposed
to
spend
their
afternoon
and
smilingly
explained
as
to
dick
lee
that
saturday
is
one
of
my
busy
days
and
he
will
have
to
stay
at
home
and
help
errands
to
run
and
i
want
him
to
learn
how
he
a
bright
active
little
fellow
that
was
all
according
to
contract
but
dick
did
not
come
in
for
his
dinner
until
the
rest
had
eaten
theirs
and
then
he
barely
had
time
to
say
to
dab
kinzer
did
you
ebber
shell
corn
course
i
have
why
dar
a
bigger
heap
ob
corn
out
in
de
barn
dan
you
ebber
see
ham
well
no
not
so
big
as
mebbe
but
dar
more
ob
it
i
got
it
to
shell
dab
went
off
with
the
other
two
vaguely
beginning
to
ask
himself
if
shelling
corn
came
fairly
into
the
proper
meaning
of
the
word
chores
all
that
sort
of
thing
was
quickly
forgotten
however
for
there
were
a
dozen
groups
of
boys
scattered
here
and
there
over
the
broad
expanse
of
the
green
and
ford
foster
at
once
exclaimed
boys
let
examine
that
crowd
it
take
all
the
afternoon
to
find
what
they
know
getting
acquainted
is
apt
to
be
a
slow
process
in
cases
of
that
sort
unless
it
is
taken
hold
of
with
vigor
and
ford
was
the
very
fellow
to
hurry
it
up
before
the
afternoon
was
over
every
boy
on
that
green
knew
who
he
was
and
where
he
came
from
and
a
good
share
of
them
had
tried
their
hands
at
chaffing
him
and
his
friends
of
these
latter
it
may
safely
be
said
that
not
a
single
one
could
afterwards
remember
that
he
had
seemed
to
himself
to
get
the
best
of
it
first
day
at
school
is
pretty
safe
to
be
a
also
and
none
of
the
wordy
collisions
went
too
far
although
it
was
plain
that
the
had
not
yet
attained
any
high
degree
of
popularity
after
supper
dick
lee
set
off
for
brandegee
and
his
friends
attended
him
nearly
to
the
gate
they
would
have
been
glad
to
have
had
a
report
of
his
visit
from
him
on
his
return
but
he
had
his
chores
to
do
then
and
any
amount
of
careful
instruction
concerning
them
to
receive
from
myers
and
almira
the
other
three
were
more
thoroughly
tired
out
than
they
had
at
all
expected
and
were
all
quite
ready
to
agree
with
frank
harley
we
better
get
to
bed
boys
i
want
to
see
if
this
is
a
good
house
to
sleep
in
sleep
said
ford
i
could
go
to
sleep
in
an
omnibus
early
to
bed
meant
early
to
rise
necessarily
and
they
were
all
up
and
dressed
the
next
morning
when
dick
lee
slipped
in
on
them
before
they
had
time
to
ask
him
a
question
he
exclaimed
i
say
dab
is
you
goin
to
church
dis
mornin
of
course
we
all
going
so
i
heerd
myers
tell
miss
almiry
she
goin
to
take
you
along
wid
her
when
she
goes
richard
said
ford
are
you
going
hab
heerd
a
word
about
dat
do
you
go
back
on
your
friends
richard
be
all
ready
in
time
sure
you
live
and
go
with
us
or
i
complain
to
dr
brandegee
dick
grin
was
a
wide
one
but
he
responded
i
be
ready
see
i
ai
the
voice
of
almira
calling
his
name
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
prevented
any
further
conversation
just
then
and
dick
found
afterwards
that
he
had
undertaken
a
task
of
some
difficulty
he
hardly
knew
when
or
where
he
squeezed
out
the
time
for
the
proper
polishing
of
his
shoes
or
the
due
arrangement
of
his
magnificent
red
necktie
but
both
feats
were
accomplished
most
faithfully
the
subject
of
came
up
again
incidentally
at
the
and
the
remarks
of
her
young
boarders
met
the
emphatic
approval
of
myers
and
her
daughter
perhaps
because
neither
of
them
had
been
near
enough
after
dick
dodged
out
of
their
room
at
the
end
of
his
early
call
to
hear
dabney
kinzer
remark
ford
do
you
think
we
can
find
our
way
across
the
green
without
any
help
from
the
ladies
i
am
pondering
that
matter
what
do
you
say
frank
we
must
get
out
of
it
if
we
can
politely
i
do
just
see
how
we
do
it
do
it
why
we
all
wait
for
dick
lee
myers
took
a
little
too
much
for
granted
and
when
the
hour
came
for
starting
there
came
a
slight
disturbance
in
the
smooth
current
of
her
calculations
foster
she
called
out
in
her
best
voice
from
half
way
up
the
stairs
the
first
bell
is
ringing
are
you
and
your
friends
ready
ringing
responded
ford
so
it
is
i
regret
to
say
we
are
not
yet
ready
to
go
at
the
same
moment
dab
was
whispering
we
must
start
until
it
nearly
done
tolling
what
that
asked
frank
do
you
know
it
always
so
in
the
country
first
they
ring
the
bell
as
it
ringing
now
that
to
set
people
then
they
toll
it
you
hear
in
a
few
minutes
that
means
the
time
up
ford
foster
city
training
had
not
taught
him
as
much
as
that
but
he
was
glad
to
know
it
myers
once
more
urged
upon
them
the
necessity
of
making
haste
it
wo
do
to
be
late
she
said
i
never
allow
myself
to
be
a
minute
behind
time
the
last
clause
sounded
a
very
very
little
impatient
but
ford
once
more
politely
expressed
his
sorrow
and
abstained
from
putting
on
his
coat
at
that
moment
too
dick
lee
came
tiptoeing
in
from
his
cheerless
garret
and
looking
astonishingly
spruce
the
shine
on
his
shoes
was
a
brilliancy
to
be
remembered
and
so
was
the
shine
on
his
face
and
the
sunset
glow
of
his
necktie
sh
dick
said
dab
hold
still
a
minute
the
bell
beginning
to
toll
i
fear
almira
and
i
will
be
compelled
to
start
said
myers
regretfully
perhaps
you
can
overtake
us
if
you
hurry
perhaps
we
could
replied
ford
but
i
beg
you
will
not
let
yourself
be
late
on
our
account
we
coming
he
began
to
put
his
coat
on
as
she
and
almira
went
through
the
gate
in
such
a
village
as
that
no
one
was
afraid
to
leave
a
house
alone
for
an
hour
or
two
not
only
was
the
on
the
latch
as
usual
but
dick
lee
had
been
vaguely
expected
to
stay
at
home
there
again
myers
had
taken
too
much
for
granted
and
she
had
not
said
a
word
to
him
about
it
just
as
she
heard
the
bell
give
its
last
few
rapid
and
warning
strokes
and
disappeared
through
the
she
might
have
seen
had
she
turned
back
and
looked
once
more
towards
her
own
front
gate
four
youngsters
hurrying
from
it
across
the
street
as
if
a
great
deal
depended
on
their
reaching
church
before
service
could
begin
it
very
kind
of
myers
to
invite
us
remarked
ford
but
she
never
thought
how
bashful
we
be
about
it
they
were
quickly
within
the
ample
porch
of
the
roomy
and
not
at
all
overcrowded
edifice
and
were
greeted
by
two
or
three
elderly
gentlemen
with
a
degree
of
prompt
cordiality
which
left
little
to
be
asked
for
the
deacons
were
awake
to
their
duty
relating
to
new
scholars
students
they
called
them
and
every
attention
was
paid
these
four
who
had
begun
so
well
their
first
sunday
so
it
would
be
at
every
church
on
that
green
and
it
would
really
be
about
the
middle
of
the
term
before
stray
academy
boys
would
be
left
to
find
their
own
way
to
benches
in
the
galleries
one
of
the
best
pews
in
the
house
well
forward
in
the
middle
aisle
and
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
there
was
not
another
pew
in
church
that
morning
which
seemed
to
attract
so
large
a
share
of
the
attention
of
the
congregation
myers
and
almira
were
several
pews
behind
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
there
had
been
no
opportunity
to
capture
her
four
boarders
or
any
of
them
while
they
were
marching
in
almira
if
they
have
brought
dick
with
them
yes
mother
but
how
very
well
they
look
kinzer
is
really
quite
handsome
that
was
hardly
dab
opinion
of
himself
and
nobody
had
ever
taken
pains
to
tell
him
so
but
the
four
of
them
standing
up
together
and
all
singing
made
quite
a
picture
dick
lee
was
between
dab
kinzer
and
frank
harley
and
seemed
to
feel
in
honor
bound
to
sing
his
best
that
was
very
well
too
if
glorianna
could
but
have
had
a
look
at
her
boy
that
morning
there
is
no
such
thing
as
telling
how
proud
she
would
have
felt
about
him
it
was
too
bad
she
could
not
have
done
so
especially
as
dick
was
most
loyally
thinking
of
her
and
wishing
that
she
could
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
by
myers
or
anybody
else
with
the
strict
decorum
of
her
boarders
and
their
profound
attention
to
the
service
and
sermon
but
she
felt
that
she
had
a
duty
to
perform
and
she
only
waited
the
proper
time
for
its
performance
the
last
hymn
had
been
duly
sung
and
the
boys
were
drifting
along
with
the
tide
in
the
aisle
towards
the
door
when
dabney
nudged
ford
with
his
elbow
we
nabbed
ford
no
escape
this
time
that
a
fact
do
let
try
she
means
it
all
for
politeness
they
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
have
been
allowed
to
get
out
and
go
home
unnoticed
but
there
in
the
porch
awaiting
them
were
myers
and
almira
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
an
escape
it
would
have
been
unkind
to
try
in
the
face
of
so
much
smiling
besides
they
did
board
with
her
and
she
had
her
rights
of
property
one
of
which
was
to
show
them
off
and
introduce
them
she
proceeded
to
exercise
it
at
once
and
it
was
to
the
credit
of
the
three
white
boys
that
they
came
promptly
to
her
assistance
and
added
any
little
matter
she
might
happen
to
miss
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
deacon
short
this
is
dabney
kinzer
of
long
island
this
is
frank
harley
of
rangoon
son
of
rev
harley
our
missionary
this
is
ford
foster
son
of
the
eminent
lawyer
delighted
began
the
deacon
rapidly
grasping
and
shaking
hand
after
hand
with
a
peculiar
lift
of
his
elbow
that
placed
most
of
what
might
be
called
the
action
at
the
point
of
it
but
ford
was
thinking
of
the
thing
myers
had
omitted
and
he
promptly
added
glad
to
meet
you
deacon
short
and
this
is
my
friend
richard
lee
of
long
island
to
do
the
good
deacon
justice
his
grasp
of
dick
hand
was
every
bit
as
cordial
as
any
other
of
his
grasps
and
he
beamed
on
the
smiling
black
boy
in
a
way
that
gave
him
back
after
the
manner
of
a
reflection
a
great
glow
of
the
best
and
broadest
beaming
myers
did
not
stop
a
moment
in
the
repetition
of
her
formula
and
there
was
sharp
work
before
her
but
dab
tongue
was
also
loose
now
and
elder
potter
had
hardly
time
to
hear
who
he
was
before
deacon
short
had
to
let
go
of
dick
and
hear
dab
say
how
d
do
elder
potter
and
this
is
my
near
neighbor
and
friend
richard
lee
sunderland
began
myers
to
a
lady
whose
face
and
dress
declared
her
a
social
magnate
my
new
boarder
frank
harley
and
the
rest
of
her
introduction
speech
followed
and
stately
sunderland
had
just
time
to
utter
a
few
words
of
gracious
inquiry
about
the
precious
health
of
frank
father
and
mother
when
he
too
took
up
the
omission
and
dick
lee
introduction
stepped
into
the
place
of
any
other
answer
for
a
moment
it
was
a
good
thing
for
dick
as
sunderland
was
a
member
of
a
society
for
promoting
emigration
to
liberia
and
was
seized
at
once
with
a
dim
idea
that
a
part
of
her
mission
was
standing
before
her
in
very
brilliant
shoes
and
a
new
red
necktie
she
did
not
know
how
utterly
she
and
the
other
good
people
and
those
three
boys
were
demolishing
a
curious
vision
of
almira
and
her
mother
of
some
social
advantage
they
might
derive
thenceforward
from
having
a
colored
servant
in
their
employ
dick
own
chance
was
coming
right
down
upon
him
a
little
before
he
was
quite
ready
for
it
for
the
minister
and
his
wife
came
out
a
few
moments
later
and
sunderland
took
upon
herself
the
duty
of
presenting
richard
lee
to
them
very
much
if
as
she
would
have
said
my
dear
fallow
my
dear
fallow
see
what
i
found
is
he
not
remarkable
the
words
she
really
uttered
were
somewhat
more
formal
but
the
good
little
minister
and
very
little
wife
were
still
shaking
hands
with
dick
that
is
with
his
right
hand
when
he
turned
almost
eagerly
and
caught
hold
of
dab
kinzer
with
his
left
yes
sir
an
dis
is
dab
i
mean
this
is
my
friend
dabney
kinzer
of
long
island
de
bes
how
do
you
do
kinzer
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
fallow
and
dick
success
was
complete
except
that
he
was
saying
to
himself
i
jes
ca
trus
my
tongue
wid
de
oder
boys
dey
got
to
take
dar
chances
now
kinzer
said
miss
almira
at
that
moment
it
time
we
were
going
home
yes
frank
said
her
mother
patronizingly
i
think
we
had
better
be
going
if
such
an
exercise
as
introduction
could
earn
it
they
were
both
entitled
to
good
appetites
and
after
all
it
had
been
quite
a
nice
little
affair
dabney
was
quite
as
tall
as
miss
almira
but
as
they
walked
across
the
green
side
by
side
he
could
not
avoid
a
that
gave
him
a
very
clear
idea
of
the
difference
between
his
present
company
and
annie
foster
it
was
at
that
very
moment
that
it
occurred
to
frank
that
he
had
last
walked
home
from
church
under
the
protecting
wing
of
the
portly
and
matronly
kinzer
and
he
could
but
draw
some
kind
of
a
comparison
between
her
and
myers
they
both
widows
he
thought
but
there
is
any
other
resemblance
ford
and
dick
brought
up
the
rear
and
for
some
reason
or
there
may
have
been
more
than
one
they
were
both
in
capital
good
spirits
tell
you
wot
exclaimed
dick
if
goin
to
de
is
all
like
dis
yer
i
am
very
glad
indeed
that
i
ever
came
oh
you
all
right
said
ford
but
there
more
good
people
in
this
village
than
i
any
idea
of
i
glad
we
came
to
church
dick
said
myers
a
little
sharply
when
they
reached
the
gate
i
want
some
wood
and
a
pail
of
water
you
better
hurry
up
stairs
and
put
on
your
clothes
chapter
xxix
letters
home
from
the
dick
lee
first
grief
there
was
a
large
number
of
new
scholars
assembled
in
the
great
room
of
grantley
academy
on
the
first
monday
morning
of
that
fall
term
there
were
also
many
who
had
been
there
before
but
the
were
in
the
majority
there
were
boys
from
the
village
boys
from
the
surrounding
country
and
boys
from
even
farther
away
than
the
southern
shore
of
long
island
and
they
were
of
many
kinds
and
ages
the
youngest
may
have
been
under
twelve
and
entitled
to
ride
in
a
at
and
several
of
the
very
older
ones
had
already
cast
their
first
vote
as
men
counting
them
all
and
adding
those
who
were
to
make
their
appearance
during
the
week
they
made
a
little
army
of
nearly
two
hundred
there
was
also
a
young
ladies
department
with
about
a
hundred
pupils
and
there
was
quite
as
great
a
variety
among
them
as
among
their
young
gentlemen
the
assigned
to
the
lady
teachers
and
their
several
grades
of
learners
were
all
on
the
northern
side
of
the
academy
building
there
was
a
large
wing
there
that
belonged
to
them
and
they
only
met
the
boys
face
to
face
in
the
great
room
during
morning
exercises
even
those
of
them
who
lived
or
boarded
in
the
southern
half
of
the
village
found
their
way
across
the
green
coming
and
going
under
the
shade
of
the
most
northerly
row
of
trees
as
to
the
great
room
itself
there
had
been
much
trouble
about
the
name
of
it
brandegee
called
it
the
and
he
did
a
great
deal
towards
making
it
so
there
were
those
who
tried
to
say
chapel
when
they
spoke
of
it
but
so
many
others
refused
to
know
what
place
they
were
speaking
of
that
they
had
to
give
it
up
hall
would
not
fit
because
it
was
square
and
the
boys
generally
rejected
the
doctor
name
because
of
connected
with
the
word
lecture
so
it
came
to
be
the
great
room
and
no
more
and
a
great
thing
it
was
for
dick
lee
to
find
himself
sitting
on
one
of
the
front
seats
of
it
with
his
friends
all
in
line
at
his
right
waiting
their
turn
with
him
to
be
classified
and
sent
about
their
business
brandegee
made
wonderfully
rapid
work
of
it
and
his
several
assistants
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
the
fact
is
said
ford
the
first
chance
he
had
to
speak
to
dab
been
studying
that
man
he
taught
school
before
guess
he
knows
how
too
and
i
ai
afraid
about
dick
lee
now
seen
the
rest
he
can
go
right
ahead
of
some
of
them
they
bounce
him
if
he
does
tell
you
what
dab
if
you
and
i
want
to
be
popular
here
we
better
wear
our
old
clothes
every
day
but
sunday
and
miss
about
half
the
questions
that
come
to
us
dick
wo
be
sharp
enough
for
that
he
says
he
going
to
write
a
letter
home
tonight
made
him
turn
pale
too
those
first
letters
home
ford
was
a
matter
of
course
and
frank
harley
had
had
some
practice
already
but
dab
kinzer
had
never
tried
such
a
thing
before
and
dick
lee
would
not
come
to
anybody
else
for
instructions
neither
would
he
permit
anybody
not
even
captain
dab
to
see
his
letter
after
it
was
written
i
been
mighty
partikler
de
pronounciation
he
said
to
himself
specially
in
wot
i
wrote
to
morris
but
i
like
to
see
dem
all
read
dem
letters
guess
dar
be
a
high
time
at
our
house
it
would
be
a
long
while
before
frank
harley
epistle
would
reach
the
eyes
that
were
anxiously
waiting
for
it
but
there
were
indeed
high
times
in
those
three
houses
on
the
shore
old
bill
lee
was
obliged
to
trust
largely
to
the
greater
learning
of
his
wife
but
he
chuckled
over
every
word
he
managed
to
pick
out
as
if
he
had
pulled
in
a
bluefish
and
the
signature
at
the
bottom
affected
him
somewhat
as
if
he
had
captured
a
small
whale
sho
de
boy
said
glorianna
he

dar

i
goin

it
do
her
good
to
hear
from
de
so
it
did
for
dick
letter
to
his
mother
like
the
shorter
one
he
sent
to
ham
morris
was
largely
made
up
of
complimentary
remarks
concerning
dabney
kinzer
when
glorianna
knocked
at
the
kitchen
door
of
the
morris
mansion
however
it
was
opened
by
the
help
and
she
might
have
lost
her
errand
if
kinzer
had
not
happened
to
hear
her
voice
it
is
just
possible
it
was
pitched
somewhat
higher
than
usual
that
morning
glorianna
is
that
you
come
right
in
we
some
letters
from
the
boys
something
in
them
about
dick
that
you
be
glad
to
hear
sho
de
boy
course
dey
all
had
to
say
him
i
like
to
know
wot

dough
in
she
went
but
more
than
the
kinzer
family
were
gathered
in
the
foster
and
annie
had
brought
jenny
walters
with
them
and
ham
was
there
and
all
the
rest
and
they
all
sat
still
as
mice
while
glorianna
listened
to
dab
account
and
ford
of
the
journey
to
grantley
and
the
arrival
and
the
examination
and
their
there
was
not
a
word
of
complaint
anywhere
and
it
did
seem
as
if
ham
morris
was
right
when
he
said
we
hit
it
this
time
foster
i
think
i
ought
to
write
to
hart
and
thank
him
for
his
recommendation
just
as
you
please

kinzer
but

the
radiant
glorianna
but

wo

me
how
to
make
dat
puddin
i
like
to
know
jes
wot
dey
eat
at
de
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
know
that
the
boys
were
so
well
satisfied
but
there
was
her
usual
good
sense
in
kinzer
suggestion
about
its
being
the
very
first
week
there
are
never
any
more
such
letters
as
first
letters
nor
any
other
weeks
like
the
first
the
fact
that
there
were
so
many
boys
together
all
old
acquaintances
shut
out
any
such
thing
as
loneliness
and
it
was
not
time
to
be
homesick
all
that
week
was
really
spent
in
getting
settled
and
there
did
not
seem
to
be
more
than
a
day
or
so
of
it
saturday
came
around
again
somewhere
in
the
place
commonly
taken
by
wednesday
and
surprised
them
all
they
had
all
been
busy
enough
but
dick
lee
had
never
in
all
his
life
found
so
little
spare
time
on
his
hands
it
no
use
dab
he
remarked
on
friday
we
ca
eat
up
all
de
corn
i
shelled
not
if
we
has
johnnycake
from
now
till
nex
summer
dab
was
looking
a
little
thoughtful
at
that
moment
ford
he
said
slowly
has
she
missed
a
day
yet
a
corn
day
no
or
a
meal
no
i
said
i
cut
a
notch
on
my
slate
first
time
she
did
and
it
all
smooth
yet
he
held
it
up
as
he
spoke
and
frank
remarked
yes
smooth
enough
on
that
side
but
you
nicked
it
all
down
on
the
other
end
to
end
what
that
for
that
oh
that
quite
another
thing
i
keeping
tally
of
joe
and
fuz
every
time
one
of
asks
a
question
about
our
or
myers
or
almira
or
little
brandegee
i
nick
it
down
got
to
quit
pretty
soon
or
buy
another
slate
they
kind
o
kept
away
from
us
said
dab
they
in
only
one
of
my
classes
but
they
in
three
of
yours
ai
in
any
ob
mine
said
dick
but
brandegee
says
he
promote
me
soon
dick
tongue
always
began
to
work
better
the
moment
he
mentioned
the
i
do
mind
their
keeping
away
from
us
said
frank
nor
i
said
ford
at
that
moment
they
reached
their
own
gate
and
dick
darted
forward
in
response
to
an
imaginary
call
from
myers
ford
went
on
they
can
keep
away
all
they
please
but
they
wo
do
it
long
bound
on
mischief
of
some
kind
to
us
asked
frank
well
yes
but
it
light
on
richard
lee
first
he
wo
say
a
word
to
us
about
it
but
they
bothered
him
i
ask
him
said
dab
in
whose
face
a
flush
was
rising
they
must
let
dick
alone
they
wo
then
and
there
plenty
of
others
just
like
getting
together
in
a
kind
of
a
flock
these
last
two
or
three
days
some
of
are
pretty
big
ones
boys
exclaimed
frank
how
about
our
boxing
lessons
guess
we
have
forgotten
all
in
one
week
said
ford
i
was
thinking
about
so
were
they
all
and
they
held
a
about
it
in
their
own
room
before
supper
the
result
was
that
by
a
unanimous
vote
that
saturday
was
to
be
devoted
to
the
catching
of
fish
rather
than
to
playing
ball
or
any
thing
else
that
would
bring
them
into
immediate
contact
with
joe
and
fuz
they
had
all
brought
their
with
them
as
a
matter
of
course
plenty
of
worms
for
bait
were
to
be
dug
in
the
garden
and
dab
kinzer
had
learned
by
careful
inquiry
that
both
bait
and
tackle
could
be
used
to
good
purpose
in
the
waters
of
green
pond
and
sundry
other
small
bits
of
lakes
miles
and
miles
away
among
the
hills
to
the
north
of
grantley
we
have
a
grand
time
he
said
and
it
do
us
all
good
no
crabs
though
wonder
if
those
fish
bite
like
ours
down
in
the
bay
some
do
and
some
do
said
ford
i
caught
it
did
not
occur
to
him
now
however
that
he
could
probably
teach
dab
and
they
all
obeyed
the
there
were
three
kinds
of
on
the
table
but
the
boys
were
thinking
of
something
more
important
and
dab
hardly
received
his
first
cup
of
tea
before
he
remarked
we
all
going
myers
but
we
may
get
home
in
time

farm
dick
had
been
in
the
kitchen
and
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
door
while
dab
was
speaking
wood
he
muttered
to
himself

load
of
them
i
am
sorry

myers
with
more
of
firmness
and
less
of
smile
than
they

ever
seen

her
face
before
i

no
objection
to
the
rest
of
you

moment
chapter
xxx
dabney
kinzer
tries
fishing
for
the
first
time
conversation
did
not
flourish
at
the
that
friday
evening
there
was
a
puzzled
look
on
the
faces
of
myers
and
her
daughter
and
their
three
boarders
seemed
to
be
running
a
kind
of
race
with
each
other
as
to
which
of
them
should
make
out
to
be
the
most
carefully
polite
as
for
poor
dick
lee
out
there
in
the
kitchen
the
nearest
he
came
to
breaking
the
silence
was
in
a
sort
of
smothered
groan
and
a
determination
to
git
up
good
and
early
an
dig
dem
fellers
de
bes
worms
dey
is
in

gardin
there
was
talk
enough
in
the
room
up
stairs
in
the
course
of
the
evening
but
the
door
was
closed
and
there
was
no
chance
for
any
one
in
the
passage
outside
no
matter
how
silently
he
or
she
might
go
by
to
hear
a
distinct
word
of
it
you
see
boys
said
ford
foster
at
the
end
of
some
extended
remarks
i
not
at
all
mean
or
exacting
my
father
only
pays
myers
three
dollars
a
week
and
all
she
agreed
to
give
was
board
i
ca
expect
her
to
be
any
kind
of
an
aunt
too
and
let
me
go
i
take
it
all
off
her
hands
and
let
myself
go
it
hard
on
dick
though
said
dab
and
she
kind
o
got
the
right
of
it
i
she
has
but
if
he
is
earning
all
he
gets
i
mistaken
boys
if
she
puts
any
more
work
on
him
what
we
do
eat
said
dab
that
the
only
way
we
can
make
it
up
we
ca
do
it
dab
not
unless
the
price
of
goes
up
think
of
eating
another
three
dollars
worth
of
every
week
their
landlady
came
out
in
all
her
smiles
at
breakfast
and
hoped
they
would
have
good
success
with
their
fishing
only
she
added
i
not
very
fond
of
fish
and
i
never
take
the
trouble
to
clean
them
we
will
try
and
catch
ours
ready
cleaned
myers
said
ford
now
boys
if
you
ready
i
am
they
were
ready
bait
and
all
thanks
to
dick
and
the
breakfast
had
been
an
early
one
dab
thanked
myers
for
that
even
while
he
wished
he
had
ford
foster
tongue
to
do
it
with
in
fact
he
had
been
noticing
of
late
that
his
ideas
came
to
him
a
little
slowly
not
but
what
he
had
plenty
of
them
but
they
seemed
disposed
to
crowd
one
another
so
that
whenever
there
was
any
thing
to
be
said
in
a
hurry
ford
was
sure
to
get
ahead
of
him
and
sometimes
even
quiet
frank
harley
must
be
i
growing
somehow
he
said
to
himself
or
i
would
be
so
awkward
the
north
road
from
grantley
led
through
a
region
that
was
as
the
old
farmers
said
of
it
back
and
was
less
thickly
peopled
than
it
had
been
two
or
three
generations
before
there
had
once
been
pretty
well
cultivated
farms
all
around
some
of
the
little
lakes
that
were
now
bordered
by
stout
growths
of
forest
and
the
roads
among
the
hills
wore
a
neglected
look
many
of
them
as
if
it
had
ceased
to
profit
anybody
to
keep
them
in
order
there
was
coming
and
going
over
them
nevertheless
and
the
boys
managed
to
get
a
lift
of
nearly
five
miles
in
a
farmer
wagon
so
that
they
reached
the
vicinity
of
green
pond
sooner
than
they
had
expected
and
with
much
less
fatigue
the
same
farmer
in
response
to
anxious
questioning
by
dab
informed
him
fish
wall
nobody
do
ketch
much
nowadays
time
was
when
they
was
pretty
much
all
fished
out
but
i
heerd
there
was
some
fellers
turned
in
a
heap
of
seedlin
fish
three
or
four
year
ago
right
away
arter
that
my
boys
went
over
and
put
in
three
days
a
hand
runnin
but
they
did
get
nothin
but
plenty
of
them
yit
i
that
was
encouraging
but
ford
at
once
remarked
a
fish
are
they
not
i
know
them
somewhat
depressed
and
extended
laterally
guesso
you
school
at
the
ai
ye
yes
we
there
thought
so
it
a
good
thing
for
the
hope
you
ketch
some
o
them
seedlin
fish
ef
ye
do
you
kin
jest
stuff
with
big
words
and
bake
they
do
say
as
how
fish
is
good
for
the
brains
do
we
turn
off
somewhere
along
here
asked
dabney
green
pond
right
down
there
through
the
woods
not
more
a
mile
ye
do
lose
yer
way
what
bait
have
ye
got
bait
are
they
the
right
thing
worms
they
do
somebody
told
ye
did
they
take
ye
long
to
larn
how
to
put
on
there
was
not
a
great
deal
to
be
made
out
of
that
old
farmer
and
his
contempt
for
a
lot
of
ignorant
young
city
fellers
in
good
clothes
did
not
require
any
further
expression
they
left
him
with
a
wide
grin
on
his
wrinkled
face
and
followed
his
directions
over
the
nearest
fence
but
with
ideas
concerning
their
probable
string
of
fish
that
were
rather
depressed
than
extended
it
was
a
long
mile
but
it
did
not
contain
any
danger
of
getting
lost
and
at
the
end
of
it
they
had
quite
enough
of
a
surprise
to
pay
them
for
their
trouble
why
ford
it
a
beauty
dab
do
you
as
nice
a
pond
as
that
has
any
thing
in
it
but
no
boat
that
i
can
see
remarked
frank
we
fish
from
the
shore
said
dab
there
a
log
that
runs
away
out
in
rocks
too
rocks
and
trees
and
natural
ruggedness
all
around
and
some
ten
or
a
dozen
acres
of
clear
cold
beautiful
water
with
little
brooks
and
springs
running
into
it
and
a
brook
running
out
on
the
opposite
shore
that
would
have
to
grow
considerably
before
it
would
be
fit
for
boys
said
dabney
we
missed
it
how
that
asked
ford
put
on
the
smallest
hooks
you
got
right
away
and
try
for
minnows
there
must
be
pickerel
and
bass
here
bass
of
course
did
he
say
something
about
that
what
they
put
in
and
they
were
as
big
as
pins
when
his
boys
came
for
as
they
called
them
could
be
cut
from
the
bushes
at
the
margin
and
little
fish
could
be
taken
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
trying
for
large
ones
they
found
too
before
long
that
sometimes
a
very
respectable
perch
or
bass
would
stoop
to
nibble
at
one
of
the
elegant
worms
with
which
dick
lee
had
provided
them
no
turn
of
the
tide
to
wait
for
here
dab
said
ford
and
no
crabs
to
steal
your
bait
off
hey
there
comes
one
perch
first
game
for
my
hook
we
stay
till
dark
but
we
get
a
good
string
frank
your
under
never
fished
with
one
before
said
frank
i
soon
get
the
hang
of
it
that
was
a
capital
school
for
it
at
all
events
and
they
learned
that
it
might
be
a
good
thing
for
a
little
lake
like
that
to
have
a
bad
reputation
fished
out
years
ago
i
understand
now
said
dab
understand
what
why
those
fellows
in
the
village
that
sent
me
out
here
were
playing
a
joke
on
us
a
good
deal
like
one
of
joe
and
fuz
hart
best
kind
of
a
joke
but
if
we
tell
about
it
when
we
get
home
the
whole
village
be
over
here
next
week
then
we
wo
tell
hurrah
i
get
him
in
steady
now
if
he
is
a
see
him
run
boys
this
is
going
to
be
fun
they
did
not
neglect
their
and
before
a
great
while
they
were
varying
their
bait
very
much
to
their
advantage
how
they
did
wish
for
a
boat
so
they
could
try
the
deeper
water
they
worked
their
way
along
from
point
to
point
looking
for
the
best
spot
if
such
there
were
and
dabney
at
last
found
himself
quite
a
distance
ahead
of
his
companions
boys
ford
frank
a
boat
come
on
lying
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tree
that
had
fallen
into
the
water
not
much
of
a
boat
to
be
sure
and
without
any
oars
or
even
rowlocks
but
when
the
water
was
tipped
out
of
it
and
it
was
shoved
in
again
it
actually
floated
careful
ford
said
dab
remember
dick
lee
the
old
thing
may
come
to
pieces
it
was
made
yesterday
look
as
if
christopher
columbus
owned
it
and
forgot
just
where
he
left
it
we
can
paddle
with
pieces
of
bark
as
far
out
as
we
need
go
now
the
fun
was
doubled
and
some
of
the
pickerel
they
pulled
in
reminded
dabney
of
small
while
the
bass
and
perch
were
every
way
as
respectable
as
ordinary
porgies
and
except
for
size
he
had
even
to
confess
that
the
sea
itself
contained
a
great
many
small
fish
and
that
he
had
often
had
much
poorer
luck
in
his
own
beloved
bay
the
boat
was
a
great
acquisition
but
when
they
were
paddling
ashore
for
the
fourth
time
to
turn
her
over
and
let
the
water
out
dabney
remarked
it
after
boys
could
either
of
you
fellows
eat
any
thing
eat
said
frank
i
forgotten
that
yes
let
have
lunch
but
there
more
cold
than
any
thing
else
in
the
basket
there
plenty
of
salt
and
pepper
though
and
it
wo
take
any
time
at
all
to
make
a
fire
and
broil
some
fish
did
you
ever
go
on
a
and
do
your
own
cooking
no
i
never
did
nor
i
said
ford
very
reluctantly
can
we
do
it
do
it
i
show
you
no
kettle
we
have
to
broil
you
fellows
make
a
fire
while
i
clean
some
of
these
fish
it
was
every
bit
as
good
fun
as
catching
those
fish
to
cook
them
there
on
the
shore
of
that
lovely
little
lake
dabney
did
know
all
about
it
as
became
a
boy
and
he
took
a
particular
pride
in
showing
ford
and
frank
how
many
different
ways
there
were
of
cooking
a
fish
without
an
oven
or
a
kettle
or
a
gridiron
it
was
another
fine
point
to
discover
after
they
had
eaten
all
they
could
including
the
cold
that
they
did
not
seem
to
have
made
their
strings
of
fish
look
perceptibly
smaller
tell
you
what
boys
said
dabney
next
time
we
come
out
we
bring
a
hammer
and
nails
and
some
oakum
and
i
calk
up
that
old
punt
so
she
float
well
enough
only
it
wo
do
to
dance
in
her
then
said
ford
i
move
we
do
try
her
again
if
we
got
to
carry
all
these
fish
it
be
a
long
pull
home
we
not
half
sure
of
catching
another
ride
we
can
pole
our
fish
though
and
make
it
easy
carrying
how
that
i
show
you
cut
two
poles
hang
your
strings
half
way
shoulder
the
poles
and
take
turns
carrying
one
boy
getting
rested
all
the
while
and
no
cords
cutting
your
hands
that
was
as
sensible
as
if
his
own
mother
had
told
him
and
it
was
a
good
thing
he
thought
of
it
for
they
did
not
catch
a
ride
till
they
were
half
way
home
all
the
wagons
were
coming
the
other
way
of
course
on
saturday
afternoon
but
the
one
chat
then
caught
up
with
them
had
been
carrying
a
new
stove
home
and
was
returning
empty
fine
strings
of
fish
remarked
the
as
they
clambered
in
where
you
catch
over
in
one
of
the
lakes
did
ye
though
you
do
say
guess
i
know
the
place
you
must
have
had
an
walk
though
i
declare
i
goin
to
try
that
pond
first
day
i
get
away
want
some
of
these
would
rob
ye
but
you
got
that
pickerel
thank
ye
now
oh
and
the
bass
tew
you
good
fellers
he
seemed
to
be
another
and
dab
warned
him
at
parting
that
when
he
wanted
to
get
a
string
of
fish
if
he
come
to
him
he
tell
him
just
where
to
go
all
right
glad
i
had
the
luck
to
ketch
up
with
ye
dab
said
ford
as
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
grantley
i
know
late
but
we
must
walk
through
the
village
with
these
fish
if
it
only
to
have
the
whole
town
ask
us
where
we
caught
them
that
so
i
rested
now
too
let
get
right
out
they
were
nearly
at
the
southerly
end
of
the
village
and
there
was
quite
a
walk
before
them
dab
said
frank
we
more
fish
than
we
need
at
our
house
if
we
have
for
breakfast
and
dinner
both
i
been
thinking
of
that
let
vote
on
it
now
what
do
you
say
one
string
for
the
minister
yes
said
ford
a
bass
for
fallow
a
small
pickerel
for
fallow
and
a
perch
or
a
for
each
of
the
six
little
fallows
all
right
and
that
big
pickerel
i
caught
for
brandegee
and
the
biggest
bass
in
the
lot
to
keep
it
company
let
make
him
up
a
prime
good
mess
one
that
stand
an
examination
said
ford
chapter
xxxi
fight
and
what
came
of
it
dick
lee
was
an
unwise
boy
that
afternoon
he
knew
how
to
turn
his
hand
to
a
great
many
things
thanks
to
his
and
a
woodpile
was
one
of
the
matters
he
had
learned
how
to
deal
with
but
he
had
not
taken
hold
of
that
of
myers
with
any
heart
for
his
work
it
was
simply
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
that
he
was
pulling
in
fish
or
having
any
other
kind
of
fun
while
he
was
sawing
wood
or
even
while
splitting
it
there
was
however
something
almost
vicious
in
the
way
he
came
down
with
his
axe
upon
some
of
the
more
obstinate
pieces
he
will
be
a
very
useful
boy
remarked
myers
as
she
watched
him
from
the
window
but
i
fear
i
shall
have
some
difficulty
with
the
others
they
are
very
much
inclined
to
be
uppish
dick
toiled
faithfully
and
he
felt
it
as
a
kind
of
relief
late
in
the
day
to
be
sent
to
the
at
the
lower
end
of
the
village
with
a
basket
that
was
to
bring
home
the
usual
saturday
assortment
for
myers
he
did
well
enough
in
going
but
on
his
way
home
if
the
truth
must
be
told
dick
lee
loitered
dreadfully
it
was
so
nice
a
day
and
he
had
been
so
long
at
his
woodpile
and
he
had
had
so
little
time
to
call
his
own
that
week
over
on
the
green
the
boys
of
the
village
were
playing
a
sort
of
of
with
a
picked
nine
from
the
academy
and
there
seemed
no
reason
why
dick
and
his
basket
should
not
stroll
along
inside
the
of
the
green
and
see
them
play
it
that
was
where
his
unwisdom
showed
itself
for
among
the
boys
who
were
not
playing
were
joe
and
fuz
hart
and
all
their
crowd
and
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
seen
dick
on
the
green
all
alone
that
would
have
been
quite
enough
of
itself
considering
how
black
he
was
and
that
he
was
a
new
boy
at
the
academy
but
the
additional
fact
that
he
had
his
basket
on
his
arm
opened
the
way
to
trouble
for
him
all
the
sooner
he
was
standing
still
on
the
walk
near
the
fence
gazing
at
the
batting
and
catching
with
so
deep
an
interest
that
his
mouth
would
stay
open
when
he
suddenly
found
himself
surrounded
hullo
dick
what
you
got
in
your
basket
groceries
groceries
fresh
from
afriky
let
see
jes
you
keep
off
now
give
us
that
basket
do
you
tech
a
thing
what
you
got
midnight
none
ob
youah
business
i
to
mine
put
dat
back
now
will
you
dick
had
promptly
retreated
against
the
fence
in
his
surprise
and
vexation
and
was
defending
himself
and
his
cargo
vigorously
but
he
was
sadly
outnumbered
they
were
a
cowardly
lot
for
their
all
but
helpless
victim
had
even
received
several
sharp
blows
in
return
for
his
grasps
and
pushes
and
the
matter
threatened
to
end
unpleasantly
for
him
when
suddenly
joe
hart
felt
his
feet
jerked
from
under
him
down
he
went
and
over
went
fuz
on
top
of
him
and
then
there
were
four
or
five
boys
all
in
a
heap
with
dick
basket
upset
just
beyond
them
and
dick
himself
diving
hither
and
thither
after
its
late
contents
and
exclaiming
dab
come
i
all
right
now
jes
let
me
pick
up
some
ob
dese
there
was
a
resentful
ring
in
the
last
remark
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
something
like
war
after
the
recovery
of
his
groceries
but
it
was
indeed
the
voice
of
dab
kinzer
shouting
full
and
clear
pick
up
dick
we
just
in
time
a
boy
somewhat
larger
than
the
rest
a
good
taller
than
dabney
but
with
a
somewhat
pasty
and
unhealthy
complexion
had
selected
ford
foster
as
the
shortest
of
the
new
arrivals
and
demanded
what
are
you
meddling
for
just
as
he
aimed
a
clumsy
blow
at
his
head
that
blow
did
not
hit
ford
but
a
shorter
young
ruffian
had
also
picked
him
out
perhaps
for
the
same
reason
and
the
hit
he
aimed
reached
its
mark
for
ford
had
no
extra
pair
of
arms
behind
to
box
with
frank
harley
seemed
just
then
to
be
remarkably
busy
with
the
heap
of
boys
on
the
ground
spat
that
was
the
way
something
sounded
and
dab
kinzer
added
go
for
that
fellow
on
the
grass
ford
i
take
care
of
the
long
one
you
will
will
you
spat
spat
spat
oh
i
see
you
do
know
how
to
box
weak
in
the
arms
too
better
go
home
the
tall
boy
was
stepping
backwards
quite
rapidly
with
one
hand
on
his
nose
and
the
other
swinging
wildly
in
the
air
above
him
and
ford
was
keeping
the
fellow
on
the
grass
from
getting
up
when
all
the
noise
around
them
suddenly
ceased
dr
brandegee
where
where
coming
across
the
green
at
the
upper
end
he
coming
this
way
several
of
the
late
assailants
started
on
a
run
at
once
but
dab
kinzer
had
caught
a
sharp
whisper
from
frank
harley
and
he
shouted
no
you
wo
joe
hart
hold
on
fuz
that
other
chap
must
stay
too
give
dick
back
his
groceries
dey
hooked
a
pile
ob
said
dick
his
eyes
dancing
with
triumph
jes
make
hand
ober
do
you
mean
to
say
we
been
stealing
fiercely
demanded
joe
what
me
me
steal
almost
gasped
fuz
they
would
do
such
a
thing
as
that
said
ford
not
quite
comprehending
the
situation
that
it
said
dab
let
empty
their
pockets
joe
was
indignantly
turning
inside
out
the
side
pockets
of
his
neat
and
a
small
parcel
dropped
upon
the
ground
dem
de
cloves
shouted
dick
as
he
darted
forward
and
picked
it
up
the
fingers
of
fuz
almost
unconsciously
imitated
those
of
his
elder
brother
and
with
a
like
result
dat
de
cinnamon
if
de
oder
feller
did
git
de
tea
an
de
whar
de
nutmegs
these
too
were
forthcoming
as
well
as
a
paper
of
indigo
blue
for
the
next
monday
washing
and
other
items
which
testified
strongly
as
to
how
much
at
a
time
myers
was
in
the
habit
of
buying
it
was
all
over
in
less
than
half
a
minute
but
dick
assailants
looked
very
much
as
if
they
wanted
to
sink
right
down
through
the
grass
go
home
joseph
said
ford
go
home
foster
i
write
to
your
father
that
you
out
of
these
things
at
your
we
all
our
groceries
where
we
live
i
never
touched
a
thing
roared
joe
somebody
put
in
my
pockets
do
say
any
thing
more
joseph
said
ford
calmly
if
you
do
get
enough
to
eat
come
over
to
our
house
we
wo
let
you
starve
give
you
all
the
bluing
you
want
too
they
did
not
seem
to
need
any
just
then
and
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
boys
gathering
that
they
were
glad
to
take
ford
advice
and
hurry
away
even
then
a
good
deal
more
attention
might
have
been
paid
them
all
around
but
for
the
excitement
created
in
the
mind
of
every
boy
who
looked
at
the
great
strings
of
fish
dab
and
his
friends
had
dropped
when
they
went
in
to
the
rescue
of
dick
lee
questions
as
to
where
they
were
caught
and
how
poured
upon
the
young
fishermen
so
fast
that
it
was
not
easy
to
dodge
them
all
at
once
or
prevent
a
general
stampede
of
the
academy
boys
to
green
pond
they
use
up
the
boat
in
one
day
and
all
the
fish
in
the
next
said
dab
to
frank
but
where
you
learn
to
do
what
you
did
for
fuz
and
joe
oh
one
of
father
hindu
converts
had
been
a
juggler
he
taught
me
they
the
best
in
the
world
but
father
does
like
me
to
do
much
of
it
we
can
have
some
fun
with
it
yet
though
it
came
to
me
like
a
flash
when
i
saw
those
things
on
the
ground
served
right
spoiling
on
the
ground
was
next
thing
to
stealing
come
on
boys
said
ford
it
after
five
they
were
all
glad
to
escape
from
the
crowd
especially
dick
lee
and
it
was
not
until
they
were
across
the
street
that
the
tall
form
of
brandegee
came
slowly
down
past
the
he
seemed
particularly
interested
in
that
game
it
was
currently
reported
indeed
that
he
had
been
a
athlete
in
his
younger
days
and
that
he
took
a
quiet
in
the
morning
with
his
now
before
doing
any
thing
at
all
with
his
greek
and
latin
the
was
a
sunburned
student
of
at
least
twenty
and
the
doctor
noticed
how
neatly
he
had
been
doing
his
work
wish
i
could
catch
an
equation
as
well
as
i
can
a
ball
said
the
young
fellow
coloring
a
little
perhaps
at
the
memory
of
something
in
mathematics
which
had
got
by
him
you
will
i
think
by
the
way
did
i
see
what
looked
like
a
disturbance
down
here
among
the
boys
just
now
disturbance
well
yes
i
should
say
there
was
came
near
interrupting
the
game
any
thing
serious
well
it
might
have
been
some
of
the
boys
made
a
set
on
that
little
colored
chap
mean
thing
to
do
i
ha
stopped
it
myself
but
that
kinzer
boy
and
the
other
two
that
board
with
myers
they
cleared
it
all
up
in
no
time
no
fighting
i
hope
well
no
but
i
tell
you
what
doctor
the
rest
of
the
boys
let
that
nigger
alone
his
friends
can
box
ah
yes
i
understand
they
stood
by
him
would
see
him
imposed
upon
they
just
would
they
prime
little
chaps
the
other
boys
were
they
are
i
ha
helped
but
they
did
need
any
help
no
yes
i
see
it
wo
do
to
have
any
fighting
but
then
h
they
stood
right
by
him
mr
pulsifer
brandegee
there
if
he
has
made
me
lose
a
hit
i
ha
fetched
it
but
i
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
set
him
right
about
that
scrimmage
i
thought
those
three
chaps
were
kind
o
stuck
up
but
everybody
know
where
to
place
now
there
was
nothing
like
anger
or
even
disapproval
on
face
when
he
walked
away
but
he
was
muttering
know
how
to
box
do
they
i
thought
i
saw
something
like
it
they
a
fine
lot
of
young
fellows
i
must
keep
my
eye
on
them
they
be
men
one
of
these
days
they
were
only
boys
yet
however
and
they
were
hardly
arrived
in
front
of
the
before
they
began
to
make
the
proposed
division
of
the
fish
myers
came
to
meet
dick
and
receive
an
account
of
his
errand
you
been
gone
twice
as
long
i
declare
almira
come
here
and
see
these
fish
you
have
had
wonderful
luck
i
must
say
more
we
know
what
to
do
with
i
will
attend
to
the
cleaning
of
them
began
dabney
but
dick
interrupted
him
with
guess
not
dab
i
cleaned
loads
ob
fish
wo
be
no
time
at
all
puttin
jes
a
string
or
two
dick
will
clean
them
said
myers
but
it
too
late
to
cook
any
for
supper
she
turned
away
into
the
house
as
she
spoke
and
took
almira
with
her
now
boys
said
dabney
we
just
time
before
supper
to
go
with
these
other
strings
and
get
back
they
would
have
been
late
indeed
if
they
had
stopped
to
talk
with
every
one
who
wanted
to
admire
dab
big
pickerel
and
ford
remarkable
bass
but
a
little
good
management
brought
them
to
brandegee
in
not
much
more
than
five
times
the
number
of
minutes
needed
to
walk
the
distance
the
fish
were
handed
to
the
with
the
compliments
of
harley
kinzer
and
foster
and
a
great
flourish
of
a
bow
from
the
latter
which
could
hardly
be
made
to
keep
that
string
company
till
the
doctor
should
see
it
now
for
the
minister
the
good
man
himself
replied
to
the
ring
at
his
but
dabney
was
half
sorry
he
had
consented
to
be
spokesman
this
time
my
young
friends
said
fallow
inquiringly
fish
sir
said
dab
some
we
caught
over
in
green
pond
we
thought
we
bring
you
a
mess
of
he
thought
too
without
saying
it
now
i
made
a
mess
of
it
why
did
i
let
ford
do
it
thank
you
thank
you
my
young
friends
very
kind
and
thoughtful
you
walk
in
no
sir
thank
you
it
most
we
must
hurry
back
mary
come
and
see
these
fish
some
very
fine
ones
going
indeed
saw
you
in
church
last
sunday
hope
i
see
you
there
again
to
morrow
my
dear
young
friends
sir
they
walked
away
a
little
rapidly
but
with
a
vivid
and
decidedly
pleasant
impression
that
they
had
given
the
minister
an
extraordinary
amount
of
comfort
the
fish
ai
worth
much
said
ford
it
could
have
been
just
them
no
indeed
it
was
not
and
they
failed
to
make
it
out
to
their
satisfaction
but
it
might
have
helped
them
if
they
had
seen
him
hand
the
fish
to
mary
and
say
there
what
do
you
think
of
that
the
very
boys
i
told
you
of
the
ones
you
saw
on
the
green
fighting
exactly
i
must
see
brandegee
they
ca
be
altogether
bad
bad
no
there
must
be
something
about
it
the
doctor
always
knows
he
will
be
able
to
explain
it
i
know
great
was
the
confidence
of
the
grantley
people
in
brandegee
as
to
any
and
all
things
relating
to
his
boys
and
that
of
fallow
was
none
the
less
when
her
husband
returned
from
his
evening
call
defending
that
colored
boy
you
do
say
the
dear
brave
little
fellows
fighting
is
dreadful
did
any
of
them
get
hurt
hurt
dear
no
and
they
gave
those
young
ruffians
h
well
david
had
to
do
a
great
deal
of
fighting
mary
but
we
must
not
approve
too
my
dear
i
say
they
did
right
and
the
little
woman
tired
face
flushed
into
sudden
beauty
with
her
honest
enthusiasm
over
those
boys
they
had
not
reached
the
end
of
their
day
experiences
however
when
they
left
the
minister
gate
or
even
when
they
arrived
at
their
own
at
that
very
moment
myers
was
once
more
standing
in
the
kitchen
doorway
dick
as
soon
as
you
had
your
supper
you
may
take
one
of
those
strings
of
fish
over
to
deacon
short
and
another
to
sunderland
you
may
clean
all
the
rest
yes
said
dick
vaguely
but
dar
one
string
only
one
where
are
all
the
rest
i
like
to
know
dabney
and
his
friends
were
around
the
corner
of
the
house
now
and
her
last
question
was
plainly
directed
to
them
the
rest
of
what
mrs
myers
why
the
fish
what
have
you
done
with
them
oh
they
all
right
myers
said
ford
fish
are
good
for
brains
that
what
we
done
with
brains
what
exactly
next
to
us
three
the
men
that
work
their
brains
the
hardest
around
here
are
fallow
and
my
friend
dr
brandegee
and
you
never
asked
me
a
word
about
it
about
what
inquired
dabney
i
must
say
i
do
quite
understand
do
you
mean
about
what
we
were
to
do
with
our
fish
of
course
i
do
i
ca
allow
she
hesitated
a
moment
as
if
the
next
words
were
slow
in
coming
and
dab
helped
her
out
with
ca
allow
what
mrs
myers
and
ford
added
now
myers
there
nothing
healthier
than
fish
it
wo
hurt
either
of
is
supper
ready
i
hope
it
is
said
dab
i
getting
hungry
again
myers
looked
at
them
in
amazement
and
so
did
miss
almira
for
if
one
thing
was
plainer
than
another
it
was
that
neither
of
those
three
boys
understood
the
nature
of
her
complaint
it
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
them
that
she
had
or
could
or
would
claim
any
control
over
the
results
of
their
day
fun
not
even
when
she
said
i
intended
one
string
for
deacon
short
and
another
for
sunderland
do
work
their
brains
myers
said
ford
do
need
any
fish
but
then
if
we
have
as
good
luck
next
time
we
bear
them
in
mind
we
kept
enough
for
breakfast
and
the
big
ones
be
just
the
thing
for
dinner
that
had
been
the
plan
of
myers
herself
for
she
had
already
said
to
almira
it
be
a
real
saving
and
the
corned
beef
be
just
as
good
on
monday
more
talk
would
hardly
improve
such
a
case
as
that
and
it
was
really
beginning
to
dawn
upon
myers
that
her
three
boy
boarders
had
minds
and
wills
of
their
own
moreover
that
they
had
not
the
most
distant
idea
of
failing
to
exercise
them
on
every
proper
occasion

xxxii
old
friends
and
neighbors
of
his
come
to
visit
dabney
boys
remarked
dab
kinzer
when
they
gathered
in
their
own
room
after
supper
i
ca
say
we
learned
a
great
deal
this
first
week
but
we
found
a
tiptop
and
we
settled
the
hart
boys
should
wonder
if
myers
feels
a
good
deal
more
settled
than
she
did
too
said
ford
but
i
thinking
what
frank
harley
going
to
do
with
his
fingers
when
we
can
give
him
a
chance
we
loads
of
fun
ahead
or
i
mistaken
i
wo
try
it
on
very
often
said
frank
fun
fun
that
a
fact
but
i
came
here
to
learn
something
my
dear
young
friend
said
ford
with
a
sudden
imitation
of
fallow
think
of
how
much
you
learned
in
seven
days
dab
beginning
to
know
so
much
he
ca
talk
i
not
just
comfortable
about
dick
said
dabney
oh
he
come
out
all
right
the
corn

shelled

last
forever
he
does
know
how
to

a
she
tried
making
him
read
aloud
to
her
and
almira
last
night
but
dick
thinks
she
wo
ask
him
to
do
it
again
do
be
troubled
about
richard
his
future
is
safe
part
of
it
undoubtedly
and
the
boys
had
settled
more
things
for
themselves
and
him
than
those
they
mentioned
they
had
settled
their
own
position
among
the
boys
of
the
academy
and
the
village
old
and
young
for
every
soul
of
them
had
heard
about
the
big
fight
on
the
green
before
he
went
to
bed
that
night
they
had
secured
dick
lee
position
for
him
not
that
they
had
given
him
a
false
one
but
that
he
would
be
safe
to
enjoy
almost
unmolested
whatever
position
his
own
conduct
might
earn
for
him
that
was
all
any
boy
ought
to
have
black
or
white
they
had
done
much
as
ford
said
to
settle
their
own
position
at
their
but
that
was
nothing
of
importance
compared
to
the
impression
they
had
made
upon
the
large
heart
and
brain
of
the
stately
academy
principal
they
had
made
a
firm
friend
of
him
and
of
others
whose
friendship
was
worth
having
all
that
was
a
great
deal
to
have
accomplished
in
one
short
week
but
there
was
much
more
that
would
require
their
immediate
attention
books
fishing
lectures
french
elocution
kites
composition
nutting
and
the
academy
debating
society
and
the
list
of
the
future
demands
upon
their
time
grew
as
they
talked
until
ford
exclaimed
hold
on
boys
my
brains
wo
stand
any
more
till
after
i
eaten
a
supply
of
fish
they
ought
all
to
have
been
able
to
think
harder
after
the
next
breakfast
and
dinner
but
the
corned
beef
came
on
monday
and
with
it
as
usual
came
corn
in
other
forms
the
farm
had
done
well
that
year
with
that
particular
crop
but
so
had
all
the
other
farms
east
and
west
and
myers
found
her
best
market
for
her
maize
harvest
at
her
own
table
it
would
take
a
good
while
to
dispose
of
what
dick
had
already
shelled
and
all
she
could
do
was
to
be
liberal
as
to
quantity
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
with
her
on
that
score
but
dabney
did
not
ask
for
any
more
recipes
to
send
home
to
his
mother
the
second
week
was
much
longer
than
the
first
saturday
came
around
very
nearly
in
its
own
turn
this
time
but
it
brought
with
it
such
a
storm
of
wind
and
rain
as
not
only
shut
green
pond
out
of
all
possible
calculations
but
kept
the
village
green
as
well
clear
of
all
boys
it
was
a
good
time
to
write
letters
in
and
those
written
were
long
ones
but
they
did
not
contain
a
solitary
complaint
of
any
thing
the
boys
had
yet
discovered
in
or
about
grantley
hamilton
said
kinzer
after
pondering
a
little
over
her
letter
when
it
came
dabney
seems
to
be
well
satisfied
foster
says
ford
and
frank
are
but
i
notice
he
does
say
any
thing
about
his
appetite
i
do
hope
he
is
losing
it
he
seems
to
be
studying
hard
dabney
lose
his
appetite
in
less
than
two
weeks
no
mother
kinzer
it
would
take
him
longer
than
that
it
was
just
one
week
later
that
he
showed
her
a
part
of
a
curious
epistle
he
had
himself
received
from
dab
it
had
evidently
been
written
in
a
moment
of
what
is
called
confidence
i
tell
you
what
ham
he
wrote
mother
does
know
what
can
be
done
with
corn
myers
does
she
raised
a
heap
of
it
this
year
and
the
things
she
turns
it
into
would
drive
a
crazy
i
been
giving
them
latin
names
and
frank
he
turns
them
into
hindustanee
it
real
fun
sometimes
but
i
be
the
boy
i
was
i
getting
corned
my
hair
is
silkier
and
my
voice
is
husky
my
ears
are
growing
i
like
a
few
clams
and
some
fish
once
in
a
while
just
for
a
change
a
crab
would
taste
wonderfully
good
so
would
some
oysters
and
they
do
have
any
up
here
we
had
one
good
day
fishing
since
we
came
but
we
had
to
go
miles
and
miles
after
it
now
do
you
tell
mother
we
do
get
enough
to
eat
there
plenty
of
it
and
you
ought
to
see
myers
smile
when
she
passes
the
johnnycake
we
all
trying
to
learn
that
heavenly
smile
ford
does
it
best
i
think
dick
lee
is
getting
a
little
pale
perhaps
corn
does
agree
with
him
he
learning
fast
though
and
so
am
i
but
we
have
to
work
harder
than
ford
and
frank
i
guess
the
hart
boys
know
more
than
they
did
when
they
got
here
and
they
learn
it
all
out
of
their
books
either
we
keep
up
our
french
and
our
boxing
but
oh
would
i
like
to
go
for
some
just
now
has
mother
made
any
yet
i
almost
forgotten
how
they
taste
i
was
going
by
a
house
the
other
day
and
i
smelt
some
ham
cooking
i
was
real
glad
i
had
forgotten
i
knew
what
it
was
right
away
do
you
be
afraid
about
my
studying
for
i
at
it
all
the
while
except
when
we
playing
ball
or
eating
corn
they
say
they
have
sleighing
here
earlier
than
we
do
and
more
of
it
and
plenty
of
skating
well
now
do
say
any
thing
to
mother
about
the
corn
but
wo
i
eat
when
i
get
home
yours
all
the
while
dabney
kinzer
why
the
poor
fellow
exclaimed
kinzer
it
enough
to
stop
his
growth
it
was
not
many
days
after
that
before
dabney
received
a
couple
of
boxes
by
express
the
marks
told
where
they
came
from
and
he
and
the
other
boys
carried
them
right
up
stairs
in
the
face
of
a
kind
suggestion
from
myers
that
they
might
take
them
right
out
into
the
kitchen
and
open
them
there
she
had
almost
ceased
from
putting
her
wishes
in
any
more
dictatorial
form
but
she
and
almira
wondered
exceedingly
what
might
be
the
contents
of
those
boxes
dab
was
only
a
minute
or
so
in
finding
out
what
was
in
one
of
them
boiled
ham
a
whole
one
out
with
it
frank
all
that
brown
paper
why
it
a
pair
of
chickens
all
ready
to
roast
something
more
down
under
those
slats
said
ford
in
a
tone
of
great
excitement
and
they
not
much
mashed
either
it
wonderful
how
they
did
pack
them
slats
and
shingles
and
paper
said
ford
what
can
there
be
in
that
other
box
shall
we
eat
first
or
open
it
open
it
open
it
maybe
they
sent
you
some
corn
opened
it
was
with
a
desperate
display
of
energy
ice
said
frank
harley
sawdust
shouted
ford
fish
said
dabney
clams
oysters
crabs
lobsters
dick
lee
had
gazed
in
absolute
silence
up
to
that
very
moment
and
all
he
could
say
now
was
jes
ai
dey
fine
boys
said
dab
with
a
sort
of
loving
look
at
the
contents
of
that
box
do
you
suppose
we
can
eat
those
fellows
eat
exclaimed
ford
why
after
they
cooked
well
i
we
can
but
i
feel
more
like
shaking
hands
with
all
around
just
now
they
old
friends
and
neighbors
of
mine
you
know
yes
but
i
guess
we
better
eat
them
dab
said
dick
dey
jes
knock
all
de
correck
pronounciation
out
ob
me
dey
does
ford
frank
i
ask
myers
and
almira
up
here
right
away
those
oysters
and
clams
have
got
to
be
eaten
this
very
evening
they
did
not
need
twice
asking
and
there
was
a
thoughtful
expression
on
the
face
of
myers
when
she
looked
from
one
box
into
the
other
it
was
fairly
on
her
tongue
end
to
suggest
what
share
of
those
luxuries
should
be
taken
at
once
to
deacon
short
or
sunderland
but
she
stopped
in
time
for
that
thought
was
followed
by
another
what
could
the
boys
have
been
writing
home
about
her
cooking
and
her
table
there
might
be
something
serious
in
it
for
boarders
were
people
who
came
and
went
boys
or
no
boys
and
dab
and
his
friends
were
just
the
kind
of
boys
to
come
and
go
at
all
events
she
could
not
object
to
their
having
such
a
supply
as
that
sent
them
and
she
took
up
the
responsibility
of
all
the
cookery
required
at
once
it
was
a
feast
while
it
lasted
and
the
effects
of
it
upon
the
character
of
myers
table
were
permanent
there
was
no
further
danger
that
dab
growth
would
be
checked
in
any
such
manner
as
his
mother
had
feared
nor
was
there
any
great
doubt
remaining
as
to
the
steadiness
of
his
growth
in
other
ways
during
his
school
days
at
grantley
for
he
and
his
friends
were
now
settled
and
they
had
made
that
most
important
success
in
life
a
good
beginning
the
end
