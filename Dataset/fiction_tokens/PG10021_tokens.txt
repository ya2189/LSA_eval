book
of
the
little
ottleys
by
ada
leverson
to
robert
ross
chapter
i
a
verbal
invitation
because
edith
had
not
been
feeling
very
well
that
seemed
no
reason
why
she
should
be
the
centre
of
interest
and
bruce
with
that
jealousy
of
the
privileges
of
the
invalid
and
in
that
curious
spirit
of
rivalry
which
his
wife
had
so
often
observed
had
started
with
enterprise
an
indisposition
of
his
own
as
if
to
divert
public
attention
while
he
was
at
carlsbad
he
heard
the
news
then
he
received
a
letter
from
edith
speaking
with
deference
and
solicitude
of
bruce
rheumatism
entreating
him
to
do
the
cure
thoroughly
and
suggesting
that
they
should
call
the
little
girl
matilda
after
a
rich
and
sainted
though
still
living
aunt
of
edith
it
might
be
an
advantage
to
the
future
in
every
sense
to
have
a
godmother
so
wealthy
and
so
religious
it
appeared
from
the
detailed
description
that
the
new
daughter
had
as
a
matter
of
course
and
at
two
days
old
long
golden
hair
far
below
her
waist
sweeping
lashes
and
pencilled
brows
a
rosebud
mouth
an
intellectual
forehead
chiselled
features
and
a
tall
elegant
figure
she
was
a
magnificent
creature
and
was
a
superb
beauty
of
the
classic
type
and
yet
with
it
she
was
dainty
and
winsome
she
had
great
talent
for
music
this
it
appeared
was
shown
by
the
breadth
between
the
eyes
and
the
timbre
of
her
voice
overwhelmed
with
joy
at
the
advent
of
such
a
paragon
and
horrified
at
edith
choice
of
a
name
bruce
had
replied
at
once
by
wire
impulsively
not
matilda
i
would
rather
she
were
called
aspasia
edith
read
this
expression
of
feeling
on
a
colourless
telegraph
form
and
as
she
was
at
knightsbridge
unable
to
hear
the
ironical
tone
of
the
message
she
took
it
literally
she
criticised
the
name
but
was
easily
persuaded
by
her
to
make
no
objection
the
elder
mrs
ottley
pointed
out
that
it
might
have
been
very
much
worse
it
not
a
pretty
name
objected
edith
it
was
to
be
matilda
i
should
rather
have
called
her
something
out
of
maeterlinck
ygraine
or
ysolyn
something
like
that
dear
mygraine
a
nice
name
too
said
mrs
ottley
in
her
humouring
way
so
is
vaselyn
but
what
does
it
really
matter
i
should
hold
out
on
a
point
like
this
one
gets
used
to
a
name
let
the
poor
child
be
called
asparagus
if
he
wishes
it
and
let
him
feel
he
has
got
his
own
way
so
the
young
girl
was
named
aspasia
matilda
ottley
it
was
characteristic
of
edith
that
she
kept
to
her
own
point
though
not
aggressively
when
bruce
returned
after
his
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
but
pretend
he
had
meant
it
seriously
archie
called
his
sister
dilly
archie
had
been
rather
hurt
at
the
as
it
seemed
to
him
unnecessary
excitement
about
dilly
not
that
he
was
jealous
in
any
way
it
was
rather
that
he
was
afraid
it
would
spoil
her
to
be
made
so
much
of
at
her
age
make
her
perhaps
egotistical
and
vain
but
it
was
not
archie
way
to
show
these
fears
openly
he
did
not
weep
loudly
or
throw
things
about
as
many
boys
might
have
done
his
methods
were
more
roundabout
more
subtle
he
gave
hints
and
suggestions
of
his
views
that
should
have
been
understood
by
the
intelligent
he
said
one
morning
with
some
indirectness
had
such
a
lovely
dream
last
night
mother
you
pet
how
sweet
of
you
what
was
it
nothing
much
it
was
all
right
very
nice
it
was
a
lovely
dream
i
dreamt
i
was
in
heaven
how
delightful
who
was
there
this
is
always
a
woman
first
question
you
were
there
of
course
and
father
nurse
too
it
was
a
lovely
dream
such
a
nice
place
dilly
there
er
no
no
she
was
she
was
in
the
night
nursery
with
satan
sometimes
edith
thought
that
her
daughter
names
were
decidedly
a
failure
aspasia
by
mistake
matilda
through
obstinacy
and
dilly
by
accident
however
the
child
herself
was
a
success
she
was
four
years
old
when
the
incident
occurred
about
the
mitchells
the
whole
of
this
story
turns
eventually
on
the
mitchells
the
ottleys
lived
in
a
concise
white
flat
at
knightsbridge
father
had
some
time
ago
left
him
a
good
income
on
certain
conditions
one
was
that
he
was
not
to
leave
the
foreign
office
before
he
was
fifty
one
afternoon
edith
was
talking
to
the
telephone
in
a
voice
of
agonised
entreaty
that
would
have
melted
the
hardest
of
hearts
but
did
not
seem
to
have
much
effect
on
the
exchange
which
evidently
was
not
responsive
to
pathos
that
day
exchange
are
you
ringing
off
try
again
do
i
want
any
number
yes
i
do
want
any
number
of
course
or
why
should
i
ring
up
i
want
gerrard
here
archie
interposed
can
i
have
your
long
buttonhook
archie
you
ca
just
now
dear
go
away
archie
yes
i
said
gerrard
only
gerrard
are
you
there
oh
do
keep
on
asking
me
if
i
got
them
no
they
have
answered

you
oh

bruce
came
in
edith
rang
off
archie
disappeared
really
rather
wonderful
edith
what
that
sandow
exerciser
has
done
for
me
you
laughed
at
me
at
first
but
i
improved
marvellously
bruce
was
walking
about
doing
very
mild
gymnastics
and
occasionally
hitting
himself
on
the
left
arm
with
the
right
fist
look
at
my
muscle
look
at
it
and
all
in
such
a
short
time
said
edith
reason
i
know
what
an
extraordinary
effect
these
few
days
have
had
on
me
is
something
i
have
just
done
which
i
could
have
done
before
of
course
i
naturally
a
very
powerful
man
and
only
need
a
little
have
you
done
you
know
that
great
ridiculous
old
wooden
chest
that
your
awful
aunt
matilda
sent
you
for
your
birthday
absurd
present
i
call
it
mere
lumber
it
came
i
could
barely
push
it
from
one
side
of
the
room
to
the
other
now
i
lifted
it
from
your
room
to
the
quite
easily
pretty
good
is
it
of
course
it
very
good
for
you
to
do
all
these
exercises
no
doubt
it
capital
er
you
know
i
had
all
the
things
taken
out
of
the
chest
since
you
tried
it
before
do
you
what
things
i
did
know
there
was
anything
in
it
a
silver
and
a
couple
of
salvers
said
edith
in
a
low
voice
he
calmed
down
fairly
soon
and
said
i
have
some
news
for
you
you
know
the
mitchells
i
know
the
mitchell
your
hero
in
your
office
that
you
always
being
offended
with
at
i
know
the
mitchells
by
i
ought
to
what
do
you
think
they
done
they
asked
us
to
dinner
they
fancy
and
what
i
thought
was
so
particularly
jolly
of
him
was
that
it
was
a
verbal
invitation
mitchell
said
to
me
just
like
this
old
chap
are
you
doing
anything
on
sunday
evening
here
archie
came
to
the
door
and
said
can
i
have
your
long
buttonhook
edith
shook
her
head
and
frowned
ottley
old
chap
continued
bruce
are
you
and
your
wife
doing
anything
on
sunday
if
not
i
do
wish
you
would
waive
ceremony
and
come
and
dine
with
us
would
mrs
ottley
excuse
a
verbal
invitation
do
you
think
i
said
mitchell
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
believe
we
have
got
anything
on
yes
old
boy
we
shall
be
delighted
i
accepted
you
see
i
accepted
straight
out
when
you
treated
in
a
friendly
way
i
always
say
why
be
unfriendly
and
mrs
mitchell
is
a
charming
little
woman
i
sure
you
like
her
it
seems
she
been
dying
to
know
you
i
wonder
she
still
alive
then
because
you
and
mitchell
have
known
each
other
for
eight
years
and
i
never
met
her
yet
you
will
now
let
bygones
be
bygones
they
live
in
hamilton
place
yes
lane
told
you
he
was
doing
very
well
and
his
wife
has
private
means
archie
began
again
like
a
litany
i
have
your
long
buttonhook
i
know
where
it
is
archie
certainly
not
you
ca
fasten
laced
boots
with
a
buttonhook
well
that
will
be
fun
bruce
believe
they
going
to
have
games
after
dinner
said
bruce
very
jolly
musical
crambo
that
sort
of
thing
what
shall
you
wear
edith
do
let
me
have
your
long
buttonhook
i
want
it
it
is
for
my
boots
not
what
a
nuisance
you
are
do
go
away
i
think
i
shall
wear
my
dress
with
the
sort
of
coloured
sash
no
you
not
to
have
it
archie
mother
i
got
it
i
can
soon
mend
it
mother
on
sunday
evening
bruce
high
spirits
seemed
to
flag
he
had
one
of
his
sudden
reactions
he
looked
at
everything
on
its
dark
side
on
earth
that
thing
in
your
hair
edith
a
bandeau
do
like
it
your
hair
looks
very
nice
without
it
what
on
did
you
get
it
for
about
i
think
be
trivial
edith
we
shall
be
late
ah
it
really
does
seem
rather
a
pity
the
very
first
time
one
dines
with
people
like
the
mitchells
be
late
bruce
it
eight
and
eight
i
suppose
means
well
eight
sure
you
got
the
number
right
edith
my
memory
is
unerring
dear
i
never
make
a
mistake
have
you
ever
noticed
it
oh
yes
i
think
i
have
it
hamilton
place
look
sharp
dear
on
their
way
in
the
taxi
he
gave
her
a
good
many
instructions
and
advised
her
to
be
perfectly
at
her
ease
and
there
was
nothing
to
make
one
otherwise
in
either
mr
or
mrs
mitchell
also
he
said
it
did
matter
a
bit
what
she
wore
as
long
as
she
had
put
on
her
dress
it
seemed
a
pity
she
had
not
got
a
new
one
but
this
could
be
helped
as
there
was
now
no
time
edith
agreed
that
she
knew
of
no
really
suitable
place
where
she
could
buy
a
new
evening
dress
at
on
sunday
evening
and
anyhow
he
said
she
looked
quite
nice
really
very
smart
besides
mrs
mitchell
was
not
the
sort
of
person
who
would
think
any
the
less
of
a
pretty
woman
for
being
a
little
dowdy
and
out
of
fashion
when
they
drove
up
to
what
house
agents
call
in
their
emotional
way
a
superb
desirable
magnificent
town
mansion
they
saw
that
a
large
was
evidently
going
on
a
hall
porter
and
four
powdered
footmen
were
in
evidence
jove
said
bruce
as
he
got
out
no
idea
old
mitchell
did
himself
so
well
as
the
butler
had
never
heard
of
the
mitchells
the
house
belonged
to
lord
rosenberg
it
bruce
as
he
flung
himself
into
the
taxi
i
made
a
mistake
for
once
in
my
life
i
admit
it
of
course
really
hamilton
gardens
sorry
yet
somehow
i
rather
glad
mitchell
does
live
in
that
house
are
perfectly
right
said
edith
bankruptcy
of
an
old
friend
and
colleague
could
be
no
satisfaction
to
any
man
hamilton
gardens
was
a
gloomy
little
place
like
a
tenement
building
out
of
marylebone
road
bruce
in
trying
to
ring
the
bell
unfortunately
turned
out
all
the
electric
light
in
the
house
and
was
standing
alone
in
despair
in
the
dark
when
fortunately
the
porter
who
had
been
out
to
post
a
letter
ran
back
and
turned
up
the
light
again
should
have
thought
they
could
play
musical
crambo
here
called
out
to
edith
while
he
was
waiting
now
is
it
odd
i
have
a
funny
kind
of
feeling
that
the
right
address
is
hamilton
house
suppose
you
perfectly
certain
they
do
live
at
a
private
idiot
asylum
edith
suggested
doubtfully
on
inquiry
it
appeared
the
mitchells
did
not
live
at
hamilton
gardens
an
idea
occurred
to
edith
and
she
asked
for
a
directory
the
winthrop
mitchells
lived
at
hamilton
terrace
st
john
wood
last
said
bruce
we
shall
be
too
disgracefully
late
for
the
first
time
but
be
perfectly
at
your
ease
dear
promise
me
that
go
in
quite
naturally
else
can
i
go
in
mean
as
if
nothing
had
happened
think
we
better
tell
them
what
happened
said
edith
will
make
them
laugh
i
hope
they
will
have
begun
their
dinner
they
will
have
finished
it
we
may
find
them
at
their
games
now
do
be
bitter
edith
dear
never
be
bitter
life
has
its
ups
and
downs
well
i
rather
glad
after
all
that
mitchell
does
live
in
that
horrid
little
hole
sure
you
are
said
edith
could
be
no
possible
satisfaction
to
you
to
know
that
a
friend
and
colleague
of
yours
is
either
distressingly
hard
up
or
painfully
penurious
they
arrived
at
the
house
but
there
were
no
lights
and
no
sign
of
life
the
mitchells
lived
here
all
right
but
they
were
out
the
parlourmaid
explained
the
had
been
saturday
the
night
before
said
bruce
as
he
got
in
again
had
a
curious
presentiment
that
something
was
going
wrong
about
this
dinner
at
the
mitchells
dinner
at
the
mitchells
there
does
seem
to
be
any
you
know
bruce
continued
his
train
of
thought
felt
certain
somehow
that
it
would
be
a
failure
was
it
odd
i
often
think
i
a
pessimist
and
yet
look
how
well
i
taking
it
i
more
like
a
fatalist
sometimes
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
could
tell
you
what
you
are
said
edith
i
wo
because
now
you
must
take
me
to
the
carlton
we
shall
get
there
before
closed
chapter
ii
opera
glasses
whether
to
behave
with
some
coolness
to
mitchell
and
be
as
though
it
had
been
all
his
fault
or
to
be
lavishly
apologetic
was
the
question
bruce
could
not
make
up
his
mind
which
attitude
to
take
in
a
way
it
was
all
the
mitchells
fault
they
ought
to
have
given
him
a
verbal
invitation
it
was
rude
bohemian
wanting
in
good
form
it
showed
an
absolute
and
complete
ignorance
of
the
most
ordinary
and
elementary
usages
of
society
it
was
wanting
in
common
courtesy
really
when
one
came
to
think
about
it
it
was
an
insult
on
the
other
hand
technically
bruce
was
in
the
wrong
having
accepted
he
ought
to
have
turned
up
on
the
right
night
it
may
have
served
them
right
as
he
said
but
the
fact
of
going
on
the
wrong
night
being
a
lesson
to
them
seemed
a
little
obscure
edith
found
it
difficult
to
see
the
point
then
he
had
a
more
brilliant
idea
to
go
into
the
office
as
cheerily
as
ever
and
say
to
mitchell
pleasantly
looking
forward
to
next
saturday
old
chap
pretending
to
have
believed
from
the
first
that
the
invitation
had
been
for
the
saturday
week
and
that
the
dinner
was
still
to
come
this
edith
said
would
have
been
excellent
provided
that
the
parlourmaid
had
told
them
that
she
and
bruce
had
arrived
about
a
quarter
to
ten
on
sunday
evening
and
asked
if
the
mitchells
had
begun
dinner
the
chances
against
the
servant
having
kept
this
curious
incident
to
herself
were
almost
too
great
after
long
argument
and
great
indecision
the
matter
was
settled
by
a
cordial
letter
from
mrs
mitchell
asking
them
to
dinner
on
the
following
thursday
and
saying
she
feared
there
had
been
some
mistake
so
that
was
all
right
bruce
was
in
good
spirits
again
he
was
pleased
too
because
he
was
going
to
the
theatre
that
evening
with
edith
and
vincy
to
see
a
play
that
he
thought
would
be
very
good
he
had
almost
beforehand
settled
what
he
thought
of
it
and
practically
what
he
intended
to
say
but
when
he
came
in
that
evening
he
was
overheard
to
have
a
strenuous
and
increasingly
violent
argument
with
archie
in
the
hall
edith
opened
the
door
and
wanted
to
know
what
the
row
was
about
you
tell
me
edith
where
your
son
learns
such
language
he
keeps
on
worrying
me
to
take
him
to
the
zoological
gardens
to
see
the
well
you
hear
what
he
says
the
child
a
perfect
nuisance
who
put
it
into
his
head
to
want
to
go
and
see
this
animal
i
was
obliged
to
speak
quite
firmly
to
him
about
it
edith
was
not
alarmed
that
bruce
had
been
severe
she
thought
it
much
more
likely
that
archie
had
spoken
very
firmly
to
him
he
was
always
strict
with
his
father
and
when
he
was
good
bruce
found
fault
with
him
as
soon
as
he
grew
really
tiresome
his
father
became
abjectly
apologetic
archie
was
called
and
came
in
dragging
his
feet
and
pouting
in
tears
that
he
was
making
a
strenuous
effort
to
encourage
must
be
firm
with
him
continued
bruce
it
good
heavens
am
i
master
in
my
own
house
or
am
i
not
there
was
no
reply
to
this
rhetorical
question
he
turned
to
archie
and
said
in
a
gentle
conciliating
voice
old
chap
tell
your
mother
what
it
is
you
want
to
see
cry
dear
to
see
the
damned
chameleon
said
archie
with
his
hands
in
his
eyes
father
to
take
me
to
the
zoo
ca
go
to
the
zoo
this
time
of
the
evening
what
do
you
mean
want
to
see
the
damned
chameleon
hear
exclaimed
bruce
to
edith
taught
you
this
language
townsend
taught
it
me
it
dreadful
edith
he
becoming
a
reckless
liar
fancy
her
dreaming
of
teaching
him
such
things
if
she
did
of
course
she
must
be
mad
and
you
must
send
her
away
at
once
but
i
quite
sure
she
did
archie
you
know
miss
townsend
never
taught
you
to
say
that
what
have
you
got
into
your
head
she
did
exactly
teach
me
to
say
it
she
did
give
me
lessons
in
it
but
she
says
it
herself
she
said
the
damned
chameleon
was
lovely
and
i
want
to
see
it
she
did
say
i
ought
to
see
it
but
i
want
to
i
been
wanting
to
ever
since
she
said
it
at
lunch
today
and
i
do
want
to
lots
of
other
boys
go
to
the
zoo
and
why
i
i
want
to
see
it
so
much
i
must
speak
to
miss
townsend
about
this
very
seriously
in
the
first
place
people
have
got
no
right
to
talk
about
queer
animals
to
the
boy
at
all
we
all
know
what
he
is
and
in
such
language
i
should
have
thought
a
girl
like
miss
townsend
who
has
passed
examinations
in
germany
and
so
forth
would
have
had
more
sense
of
her
responsibility
more
tact
it
shows
a
dreadful
want
of
i
hardly
know
what
to
think
of
it
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
too
all
right
bruce
edith
laughed
townsend
told
me
she
had
been
to
see
the
aux
some
time
ago
she
was
enthusiastic
about
it
archie
dear
i
take
you
to
the
zoological
gardens
and
we
see
lots
of
other
animals
and
do
use
that
expression
ca
i
see
the
da
vincy
announced
the
servant
must
go
and
dress
said
bruce
vincy
wenham
vincy
was
always
called
by
everyone
simply
vincy
applied
to
him
it
seemed
like
a
pet
name
he
had
arrived
at
the
right
moment
as
he
always
did
he
was
very
devoted
to
both
edith
and
bruce
and
he
was
a
confidant
of
both
he
sometimes
said
to
edith
that
he
felt
he
was
just
what
was
wanted
in
the
little
home
an
intimate
stranger
coming
in
occasionally
with
a
fresh
atmosphere
was
often
of
great
value
as
for
instance
now
in
calming
or
averting
storms
had
anyone
asked
vincy
exactly
what
he
was
he
would
probably
have
said
he
was
an
observer
and
really
he
did
very
little
else
though
after
he
left
oxford
he
had
taken
to
writing
a
little
and
painting
less
he
was
very
fair
the
fairest
person
one
could
imagine
over
five
years
old
he
had
pale
silky
hair
a
minute
fair
moustache
very
good
features
a
single
eyeglass
and
the
appearance
always
of
having
been
very
recently
taken
out
of
a
bandbox
but
when
people
fancied
from
this
look
of
his
that
he
was
an
fop
they
soon
found
themselves
immensely
mistaken
he
was
but
looked
a
gilded
youth
of
twenty
and
sufficiently
gilded
as
he
said
not
perhaps
exactly
to
be
comfortable
but
to
enable
him
to
get
about
comfortably
and
see
those
who
were
he
had
a
number
of
relatives
in
high
places
who
bored
him
and
were
always
trying
to
get
him
married
he
had
taken
up
various
occupations
and
travelled
a
good
deal
but
his
greatest
pleasure
was
the
study
of
people
there
was
nothing
cold
in
his
observation
nothing
of
the
cynical
analyst
he
was
impulsive
though
very
quiet
immensely
and
ardently
sympathetic
and
almost
too
impressionable
and
enthusiastic
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
was
immensely
popular
generally
as
well
as
specially
he
was
so
interested
in
everyone
except
himself
was
ever
a
greater
general
favourite
there
seemed
to
be
no
type
of
person
on
whom
he
jarred
people
who
disagreed
on
every
other
subject
agreed
in
liking
vincy
but
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
for
acquaintances
and
spent
much
ingenuity
in
trying
to
avoid
them
he
only
liked
intimate
friends
and
of
all
he
had
perhaps
the
ottleys
were
his
greatest
favourites
his
affection
for
them
dated
from
a
summer
they
had
spent
in
the
same
hotel
in
france
he
had
become
extraordinarily
interested
in
them
he
delighted
in
bruce
but
had
with
edith
of
course
more
mutual
understanding
and
intellectual
sympathy
and
though
they
met
constantly
his
friendship
with
her
had
never
been
misunderstood
frivolous
friends
of
his
who
did
not
know
her
might
amuse
themselves
by
being
humorous
and
flippant
about
vincy
little
ottleys
but
who
had
ever
seen
them
together
could
possibly
make
a
mistake
they
were
an
example
of
the
absurdity
of
a
tradition
proneness
to
calumny
such
friendships
when
genuine
are
never
misconstrued
perhaps
society
is
more
often
taken
in
the
other
way
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
truth
on
this
subject
as
on
most
others
is
always
known
in
time
had
ever
even
tried
to
explain
away
the
intimacy
though
bruce
had
all
the
air
of
being
unable
to
do
without
vincy
society
sometimes
cynically
attributed
to
husbands
in
a
different
position
vincy
was
pleased
with
the
story
of
the
mitchells
that
edith
told
him
and
she
was
glad
to
hear
that
he
knew
the
mitchells
and
had
been
to
the
house
like
you
to
know
everyone
what
did
they
do
night
i
was
there
they
played
games
said
vincy
he
spoke
in
a
soft
even
voice
was
just
a
little
well
perhaps
just
a
bit
ghastly
i
thought
but
do
tell
bruce
that
evening
i
thought
the
people
were
quite
young
enough
and
when
they
played
and
lemons
and
the
bells
of
st
clements
and
so
on
their
bones
seemed
to
well
sort
of
rattle
if
you
know
what
i
mean
but
still
perhaps
it
was
only
my
fancy
mitchell
has
such
very
high
spirits
you
see
and
is
determined
to
make
everything
go
he
wo
have
conventional
parties
and
insists
on
plenty
of
verve
so
of
course
one
forced
to
have
it
he
sighed
have
any
children
and
they
make
a
kind
of
hobby
of
entertaining
in
an
unconventional
way
sounds
rather
fun
perhaps
you
will
be
asked
next
thursday
try
try
i
call
and
remind
her
of
me
i
daresay
she
ask
me
she
very
she
believes
in
spiritualism
too
wonder
who
be
there
might
be
there
or
anyone
else
as
they
say
of
marriage
it
a
lottery
they
might
have
roulette
or
a
spiritual
séance
or
kubelik
or
fancy
dress
heads
dress
heads
or
a
cotillion
or
just
bridge
you
never
know
the
house
is
rather
like
a
country
house
and
they
behave
accordingly
even
i
believe
sometimes
and
mitchell
adores
unpractical
jokes
too
see
it
rather
exciting
that
i
going
to
the
mitchells
at
last
perhaps
it
will
be
the
of
your
life
said
vincy
here
bruce
do
think
much
of
that
opera
glass
your
mother
gave
you
bruce
remarked
to
his
wife
soon
after
the
curtain
rose
the
fashion
said
edith
jade
the
latest
thing
do
care
if
it
is
the
fashion
it
no
use
here
try
it
vincy
he
handed
it
to
vincy
who
gave
bruce
a
quick
look
and
then
tried
it
quaint
and
pretty
i
think
i
like
the
effect
he
said
handing
it
back
to
bruce
may
be
quaint
and
pretty
and
it
may
be
the
latest
thing
and
it
may
be
jade
said
bruce
rather
sarcastically
i
not
a
slave
to
fashion
i
never
was
and
i
do
see
any
use
whatever
in
an
opera
glass
that
makes
everything
look
smaller
instead
of
larger
and
at
a
greater
distance
instead
of
nearer
i
call
it
rot
i
always
say
what
i
think
and
you
can
tell
your
mother
what
i
said
if
you
like
looking
through
it
the
wrong
side
dear
said
edith
chapter
iii
the
golden
quoribus
edith
had
been
very
pretty
at
twenty
but
at
her
prettiness
had
immensely
increased
she
had
really
become
a
beauty
of
a
particularly
troubling
type
she
had
long
deep
blue
eyes
features
hair
of
that
soft
fine
light
brown
just
tinged
with
red
called
by
the
french
châtain
clair
and
a
complexion
she
was
slim
but
not
angular
and
had
a
reposeful
grace
and
a
decided
attraction
for
both
men
and
women
they
generally
tried
to
express
this
fascination
by
discovering
resemblances
in
her
to
various
pictures
of
celebrated
artists
she
had
been
compared
to
almost
every
type
of
all
the
great
painters
botticelli
sir
peter
lely
gainsborough
some
people
said
she
was
like
a
sargent
others
called
her
a
type
there
was
no
end
to
the
old
and
new
masters
of
whom
she
seemed
to
remind
people
and
she
certainly
had
the
rather
insidious
charm
of
somehow
recalling
the
past
while
suggesting
something
undiscovered
in
the
future
there
was
a
good
deal
that
was
enigmatic
about
her
it
was
natural
not
assumed
as
a
pose
of
mysteriousness
she
was
not
all
on
the
surface
not
obvious
one
wondered
was
she
capable
of
any
depth
of
feeling
was
she
always
just
sweet
and
tactful
and
clever
or
could
there
be
another
side
to
her
character
had
she
for
instance
a
temperament
this
question
was
considered
one
of
interest
so
edith
had
a
great
many
admirers
some
were
new
and
fickle
others
were
old
and
faithful
she
had
never
yet
shown
more
than
a
conversational
interest
in
any
of
them
but
always
seemed
to
be
laughing
with
a
soft
mockery
at
her
own
success
edith
was
not
a
vain
woman
not
even
much
interested
in
dress
though
she
had
a
quick
eye
and
a
sure
impressionistic
gift
for
it
she
was
always
an
immense
favourite
with
women
who
felt
subconsciously
grateful
to
her
for
her
wonderful
forbearance
to
have
the
power
and
not
to
use
it
to
be
so
pretty
yet
never
not
even
coldly
display
her
conquests
but
this
liking
she
did
not
as
a
rule
return
in
any
decided
fashion
she
had
dreadfully
little
to
say
to
the
average
woman
except
to
a
few
intimate
friends
and
frankly
preferred
the
society
of
the
average
man
although
she
had
not
as
yet
developed
a
taste
for
coquetry
for
which
she
had
however
many
natural
gifts
she
was
much
taken
up
by
bruce
by
archie
and
dilly
and
was
fond
of
losing
herself
in
ideas
and
in
books
and
in
various
artistic
movements
and
fads
in
which
her
interest
was
cultivated
and
perhaps
inspired
by
vincy
vincy
was
her
greatest
friend
and
confidant
he
was
really
a
great
and
she
told
him
nearly
every
thought
still
archie
was
so
far
her
greatest
interest
he
was
a
particularly
pretty
boy
and
she
was
justified
in
thinking
him
rather
unusual
at
this
period
he
spent
a
considerable
amount
of
his
leisure
time
not
only
in
longing
to
see
real
animals
but
in
inventing
and
drawing
pictures
of
ones
horrible
creatures
or
quaint
creatures
for
which
he
found
the
strangest
names
he
told
dilly
about
them
but
dilly
was
not
his
audience
she
was
rather
his
confidante
and
literary
adviser
or
even
sometimes
his
collaborator
his
public
consisted
principally
of
his
mother
it
was
a
convention
that
edith
should
be
frightened
shocked
and
horrified
at
the
creatures
of
his
imagination
while
dilly
privately
revelled
in
their
success
miss
townsend
the
governess
was
rather
coldly
ignored
in
this
matter
she
had
a
way
of
speaking
of
the
animals
with
a
smile
as
a
nice
occupation
to
keep
the
children
quiet
she
did
not
understand
madam
would
you
kindly
go
into
the
nursery
master
archie
wishes
you
to
come
and
hear
about
the
golden
something
he
just
made
up
like
said
dilly
nurse
with
an
expression
of
resignation
edith
jumped
up
at
once
dear
tell
master
archie
i
coming
she
ran
into
the
nursery
and
found
archie
and
dilly
both
looking
rather
excited
archie
fairly
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
on
which
was
a
rough
sketch
which
he
would
not
let
her
see
and
hid
behind
him
archie
began
in
a
low
solemn
voice
rather
slowly
golden
quoribus
is
the
most
horrible
animal
the
most
animal
you
ever
heard
of
in
life
how
awful
said
edith
beginning
to
shiver
a
moment
let
me
sit
down
quietly
and
hear
about
it
she
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
clasped
her
hands
looking
at
him
with
a
terrified
expression
which
was
part
of
the
ritual
dilly
giggled
and
put
her
thumb
in
her
mouth
watching
the
effect
with
widely
opened
eyes
more
awful
than
the
gazeka
of
course
i
suppose
edith
said
rather
rashly
said
dilly
be
quiet
dilly
mother
he
was
reproachful
do
you
mean
the
gazeka
why
the
gazeka
nothing
at
all
it
a
rotten
little
animal
it
does
count
besides
it
is
real
it
never
was
real
gazeka
indeed
i
beg
your
pardon
said
edith
repentantly
go
on
the
golden
quoribus
is
more
frightening
even
than
the
jilbery
do
you
remember
how
awful
was
and
much
larger
worse
than
the
jilbery
oh
good
gracious
how
dreadful
it
like
of
all
it
as
long
as
from
here
to
brighton
said
archie
little
longer
said
dilly
shut
up
miss
as
long
it
called
the
golden
quoribus
because
bright
gold
except
the
bumps
and
the
bumps
are
green
green
said
dilly
oh
will
you
hold
your
tongue
dilly
green
terrible
and
what
shape
is
it
pointed
and
sharp
and
it
breathe
fire
asked
edith
archie
smiled
contemptuously
fire
oh
mother
do
you
think
it
a
silly
dragon
in
a
fairy
story
of
course
it
does
how
can
it
breathe
fire
said
edith
apologetically
on
the
peculiar
thing
about
it
besides
that
it
lives
entirely
on
muffins
and
mutton
and
the
frightening
part
i
coming
to
now
he
became
emphatic
and
spoke
slowly
golden
quoribus
has
more
claws
than
any
other
animal
in
the
whole
world
she
shuddered
said
archie
solemnly
has
large
claws
coming
out
of
its
head
head
good
gracious
has
claws
here
and
claws
there
claws
coming
out
of
the
eyes
and
claws
coming
out
of
the
ears
and
claws
coming
out
of
its
shoulders
and
claws
coming
out
of
the
forehead
edith
shivered
with
fright
and
held
up
her
hands
in
front
of
her
eyes
to
ward
off
the
picture
claws
coming
out
of
the
mouth
said
archie
coming
a
step
nearer
to
her
and
raising
his
voice
edith
jumped
claws
coming
out
of
the
hands
and
claws
coming
out
of
the
feet
said
dilly
wildly
and
recklessly
and
jumping
up
and
down
claws
on
the
ceiling
and
claws
on
the
floor
and
claws
all
over
the
world
with
one
violent
slap
she
was
sent
sprawling
shrieks
sobs
and
tears
filled
the
quiet
nursery
know
said
archie
when
he
had
been
persuaded
to
apologise
course
i
know
a
gentleman
ought
to
hit
a
lady
not
even
i
mean
especially
not
if
she
his
little
sister
but
oh
mother
ought
a
lady
to
interrupt
a
story
when
edith
told
vincy
he
entirely
took
archie
side
suppose
sargent
were
painting
a
beautiful
picture
and
one
of
his
pupils
snatching
the
from
him
insisted
on
finishing
it
and
spoiling
it
how
would
he
like
it
imagine
a
poet
who
had
just
written
a
great
poem
and
been
interrupted
in
reciting
it
by
someone
who
quickly
finished
it
off
all
wrong
the
author
might
be
forgiven
under
such
circumstances
if
in
his
irritation
he
took
a
strong
line
in
vincy
opinion
it
served
dilly
jolly
well
right
young
of
course
she
was
young
but
four
he
said
was
not
a
day
too
soon
to
begin
to
learn
to
respect
the
work
of
the
artist
edith
owned
that
archie
was
not
easily
exasperated
and
was
as
a
rule
very
patient
with
the
child
bruce
took
an
entirely
different
view
he
was
quite
gloomy
about
it
and
feared
that
archie
showed
every
sign
of
growing
up
to
be
an
apache
chapter
iv
the
mitchells
the
mitchells
were
as
vincy
had
said
extremely
hospitable
they
had
a
perfect
mania
for
receiving
they
practically
lived
for
it
and
the
big
house
at
hampstead
with
its
large
garden
covered
in
and
a
sort
of
studio
built
out
was
scarcely
ever
without
guests
when
they
have
some
sort
of
party
they
invariably
went
out
mitchell
great
joy
was
to
make
his
parties
different
from
others
by
some
childish
fantasy
or
other
he
especially
delighted
in
a
surprise
he
often
took
the
trouble
for
instance
to
have
a
telegram
sent
to
every
one
of
his
guests
during
the
course
of
the
evening
each
of
these
wires
contained
some
personal
chaff
or
practical
joke
at
other
times
he
would
give
everyone
little
presents
concealed
in
some
way
christmas
did
come
once
a
year
to
the
mitchells
it
seemed
never
to
go
away
one
was
always
surprised
not
to
find
a
christmas
tree
and
crackers
these
entertainments
always
splendidly
done
materially
and
curiously
erratic
socially
were
sometimes
extremely
amusing
at
others
of
course
a
frost
it
was
rather
a
and
the
guests
were
without
exception
the
most
extraordinary
mixture
in
london
they
included
delightful
people
absurd
people
average
people
people
who
were
smart
and
people
who
were
dowdy
some
who
were
respectable
and
nothing
else
some
who
were
deplorable
others
beautiful
and
many
merely
dull
there
was
never
the
slightest
attempt
at
any
sort
of
harmonising
or
of
suitability
there
was
a
great
deal
of
kindness
to
the
and
a
wild
and
extravagant
delight
in
any
novelty
in
fact
the
mitchells
were
everything
except
exclusive
and
as
they
were
not
guided
by
any
sort
of
rule
they
really
lived
in
st
john
wood
superior
to
suburban
or
indeed
any
other
restrictions
they
would
ask
the
same
guests
to
dinner
time
after
time
six
or
seven
times
in
succession
they
would
invite
cordially
a
person
of
no
attraction
whatsoever
whom
they
had
only
just
met
and
they
would
behave
with
casual
coolness
to
desirable
acquaintances
or
favourite
friends
whom
they
had
known
all
their
lives
however
there
was
no
doubt
that
their
parties
had
got
the
name
for
being
funny
and
that
was
quite
enough
london
people
in
every
set
are
so
desperate
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
way
for
variety
and
oddness
that
the
mitchells
were
frequently
asked
for
invitations
by
most
distinguished
persons
who
hoped
in
their
blasé
fatigue
to
meet
something
new
and
queer
for
the
real
londoner
is
a
good
deal
of
a
child
and
loves
punch
and
judy
shows
and
conjuring
tricks
symbolically
speaking
and
is
also
often
dreaming
of
the
chance
of
meeting
some
spring
novelty
in
the
way
of
romance
although
the
mitchells
were
proud
of
these
successes
they
were
as
free
from
snobbishness
as
almost
anyone
could
be
on
the
whole
mrs
mitchell
had
a
slight
weakness
for
celebrities
while
mr
mitchell
preferred
pretty
women
or
people
who
romped
it
was
merely
from
carelessness
that
the
ottleys
had
never
been
asked
before
when
edith
and
bruce
found
themselves
in
the
large
square
hall
with
its
oak
beams
and
early
english
fireplace
about
twenty
people
had
arrived
and
as
many
more
were
expected
a
lively
chatter
had
already
begun
for
each
woman
had
been
offered
on
her
arrival
a
basket
from
which
she
had
to
choose
a
brightly
coloured
ribbon
these
ribbons
matched
the
rosettes
presented
in
an
equally
haphazard
way
to
every
man
as
vincy
observed
it
gave
one
the
rather
ghastly
impression
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
cotillion
at
once
on
sight
before
dinner
which
was
a
little
frightening
in
reality
it
was
merely
so
that
the
partners
for
the
meal
should
be
chosen
by
chance
mitchell
thought
this
more
fun
than
arranging
guests
but
there
was
an
element
of
gambling
about
it
that
made
wary
people
nervous
everyone
present
would
have
cheated
had
it
been
possible
but
it
was
not
mrs
mitchell
was
a
tiny
creature
who
looked
absurdly
young
she
was
kind
sprightly
and
rather
like
a
grouse
mitchell
was
a
man
with
a
high
forehead
almost
too
much
ease
of
manner
and
a
twinkling
eye
the
chief
guests
tonight
consisted
of
lord
rye
a
suffraget
who
was
known
for
his
habit
of
barking
before
he
spoke
and
for
his
wonderful
ear
for
music
he
could
play
all
richard
oscar
and
johann
strauss
compositions
by
ear
on
the
piano
and
never
mixed
them
up
aylmer
ross
the
handsome
barrister
myra
mooney
who
had
been
on
the
stage
and
an
intelligent
foreigner
from
the
embassy
with
a
decoration
a
beard
and
an
armenian
accent
mrs
mitchell
said
he
was
the
minister
from
some
place
with
a
name
like
ruritania
she
had
a
vague
memory
there
was
also
a
mr
cricker
a
very
young
man
of
whom
it
was
said
that
he
could
dance
like
nijinsky
but
never
would
and
the
rest
were
chiefly
foreign
office
clerks
like
mitchell
and
bruce
more
barristers
and
their
wives
a
soldier
or
two
some
undergraduates
a
lady
photographer
a
few
pretty
girls
and
vague
people
there
were
to
be
forty
guests
for
dinner
and
a
few
more
in
the
evening
almost
immediately
on
her
arrival
edith
noticed
a
tall
man
with
smooth
fair
hair
observant
blue
eyes
and
a
rather
humorous
expression
and
she
instantly
decided
that
she
would
try
to
will
him
to
take
her
to
dinner
rather
a
superfluous
effort
of
magnetism
since
it
must
have
been
settled
already
by
fate
and
the
ribbons
it
was
obvious
from
one
quick
glance
that
he
shared
the
wish
to
their
absurdly
great
mutual
disappointment
a
lot
of
ground
was
covered
very
quickly
at
the
mitchells
their
ribbons
did
match
and
she
was
taken
to
dinner
by
captain
willis
who
looked
dull
fortune
however
favoured
her
on
her
other
side
she
found
the
man
who
looked
amusing
he
was
introduced
to
her
across
the
table
by
mrs
mitchell
with
as
mr
aylmer
ross
edith
felt
happy
tonight
her
spirits
were
raised
by
what
she
felt
to
be
an
atmosphere
as
the
french
say
full
of
indulgence
sympathetic
relaxing
in
which
either
cleverness
or
stupidity
could
float
equally
at
its
ease
the
puerility
of
the
silly
little
arrangements
to
amuse
removed
all
sense
of
ceremony
the
note
is
always
struck
by
the
hostess
and
she
was
everything
that
was
amiable
without
effort
or
affectation
was
ever
afraid
of
her
bruce
neighbour
at
dinner
was
the
delicate
actress
in
a
royal
fringe
and
a
tight
bodice
with
short
sleeves
who
had
once
been
a
celebrity
though
remembered
for
what
miss
myra
mooney
formerly
a
beauty
had
known
her
days
of
success
she
had
been
the
supreme
performer
of
ladylike
parts
she
had
been
known
as
the
very
quintessence
of
refinement
it
was
assumed
when
she
first
came
out
that
a
duke
would
go
to
the
devil
for
her
in
her
youth
and
that
in
her
late
maturity
she
would
tour
the
provinces
with
three
neither
of
these
prophecies
had
however
been
fulfilled
she
still
occasionally
took
small
titled
parts
in
repertoire
matinees
she
was
unable
to
help
referring
constantly
to
the
hit
she
made
in
at
manchester
in
nor
could
she
ever
resist
speaking
of
the
young
man
who
sent
her
red
carnations
every
day
of
his
blighted
existence
for
fifteen
years
a
pure
romance
indeed
for
as
she
owned
he
never
even
wished
to
be
introduced
to
her
she
still
called
him
poor
boy
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
now
and
according
to
the
illustrated
papers
spent
his
entire
time
in
giving
away
a
numberless
succession
of
daughters
in
brilliant
marriage
at
st
george
hanover
square
in
this
way
miss
mooney
lived
a
good
deal
in
the
past
but
she
was
not
unaware
of
the
present
and
was
always
particularly
nice
to
people
generally
regarded
as
bores
so
she
was
never
without
plenty
of
invitations
mitchell
had
had
formerly
a
slight
for
her
and
in
his
good
nature
pretended
to
think
she
had
not
altered
a
bit
she
was
still
refined
cela
ne
se
fait
it
was
practically
no
longer
possible
to
find
such
a
perfect
lady
even
on
the
stage
as
she
also
had
all
the
easy
good
nature
of
the
artist
and
made
herself
extremely
agreeable
bruce
was
delighted
with
her
and
evidently
thought
he
had
drawn
a
prize
wondered
aylmer
ross
said
this
could
possibly
happen
first
i
half
hoped
it
might
then
i
gave
it
up
in
despair
did
i
said
edith
yet
i
generally
know
i
a
touch
of
second
sight
i
think
at
well
i
have
second
sight
too
any
amount
only
it
always
wrong
however
the
mitchells
dears
said
edith
quite
do
you
know
them
well
well
indeed
but
i
never
seen
them
before
i
see
well
now
we
found
our
way
here
broken
the
ice
and
that
sort
of
thing
we
must
often
come
and
dine
with
them
must
we
mrs
ottley
ca
we
come
again
next
week
sweet
of
you
to
ask
us
i
sure
at
all
very
jolly
of
us
to
turn
up
the
boot
is
on
the
other
leg
or
whatever
the
phrase
is
by
the
way
i
sure
you
know
everything
mrs
ottley
tell
me
did
people
ever
wear
only
one
boot
at
a
time
do
you
think
or
how
did
this
expression
originate
wonder
something
in
his
suave
manner
of
taking
everything
for
granted
seemed
to
make
them
know
each
other
almost
too
quickly
and
gave
her
an
odd
sort
of
she
turned
to
captain
willis
on
her
other
side
say
he
said
querulously
this
a
bit
off
we
got
the
same
coloured
ribbons
and
you
have
said
a
word
to
me
yet
rather
rot
is
it
what
have
i
i
will
now
captain
willis
lowered
his
voice
to
a
confidential
tone
and
said
you
know
what
i
always
say
is
live
and
let
live
and
let
it
go
at
that
what
a
dark
saying
said
edith
a
burnt
almond
said
captain
willis
inconsequently
as
though
it
would
help
her
to
understand
mrs
ottley
that
what
i
always
say
but
people
wo
you
know
they
wo
and
there
it
is
he
seemed
resigned
chap
mitchell
is
he
musical
chairs
i
believe
that
what
we
to
play
this
evening
or
bridge
whichever
we
like
i
shall
go
in
for
bridge
i
not
musical
which
shall
you
do
asked
aylmer
of
edith
he
had
evidently
been
listening
talk
then
shall
we
i
ca
play
bridge
either
mrs
ottley
which
is
your
husband
i
did
notice
when
you
came
in
there
opposite
the
corner
chap
with
the
light
moustache
next
to
myra
mooney
it
she
said
seems
to
be
enjoying
himself
i
glad
got
miss
mooney
he
lucky
is
indeed
said
aylmer
a
woman
like
an
old
photograph
or
someone
in
a
book
said
edith
you
care
for
books
yes
rather
i
just
been
discovering
bourget
fancy
i
know
about
him
i
just
read
for
the
first
time
yes
rather
a
pompous
chap
is
he
but
you
could
do
worse
than
read
for
the
first
time
done
worse
i
been
reading
rudyard
kipling
for
the
last
time
do
you
like
him
why
feel
all
the
time
somehow
as
if
he
were
calling
me
by
my
christian
name
without
an
introduction
or
as
if
he
wanted
me
to
exchange
hats
with
him
she
said
so
fearfully
familiar
with
his
readers
you
think
he
keeps
at
a
respectful
distance
from
his
characters
however
why
worry
about
books
at
all
mrs
ottley
flowers
lilies
of
the
field
and
so
forth
do
toil
or
spin
why
should
they
belong
to
libraries
i
do
think
you
ever
ought
to
read
except
perhaps
sometimes
a
little
poetry
or
romance
you
see
that
is
what
you
are
rather
is
it
you
care
for
books
she
answered
ignoring
the
compliment
should
have
thought
you
loved
them
and
knew
everything
about
them
not
sure
that
i
know
know
quite
enough
believe
me
he
answered
earnestly
be
cultured
do
talk
about
lloyd
george
do
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
subjects
of
the
day
right
i
try
not
she
turned
with
a
laugh
to
captain
willis
who
seemed
very
depressed
say
you
know
he
said
complainingly
is
all
very
well
all
very
well
no
doubt
but
i
only
ask
one
thing
just
one
is
this
cricket
i
merely
ask
you
know
just
that
is
it
cricket
what
is
meant
to
be
what
the
matter
i
simply
fed
up
and
you
know
hardly
two
words
have
i
had
with
you
tonight
mrs
ottley
i
suppose
that
awfully
amusing
what
i
not
amusing
i
know
that
do
say
that
indeed
you
are
she
consoled
him
i
though
you
amuse
he
laughed
cheerily
he
always
filled
up
pauses
with
a
laugh
chapter
v
the
surprise
certainly
mrs
mitchell
on
one
side
and
captain
willis
on
the
other
had
suffered
neglect
but
they
seemed
to
become
hardened
to
it
towards
the
end
of
dinner
have
a
boy
too
aylmer
remarked
irrelevantly
a
nice
chap
just
ten
though
only
by
the
merest
slightest
movement
of
an
eyelash
edith
could
not
avoid
showing
her
surprise
ever
had
less
the
air
of
a
married
man
also
she
was
quite
ridiculously
disappointed
one
say
why
but
one
does
talk
to
a
married
man
quite
in
the
same
way
or
so
frankly
as
to
a
bachelor
if
one
is
a
married
woman
she
did
not
ask
about
his
wife
but
said
boys
are
rather
nice
things
to
have
about
are
they
she
was
looking
round
the
table
trying
to
divine
which
was
mrs
aylmer
ross
no
she
was
there
edith
felt
sure
of
it
it
was
an
unaccountable
satisfaction
he
all
right
and
now
give
me
a
detailed
description
of
children
ca
i
never
could
talk
about
them
see
i
should
like
to
see
them
i
saw
you
speak
to
vincy
dear
little
fellow
is
he
a
great
friend
of
mine
tremendously
devoted
to
him
too
he
what
used
to
be
called
an
exquisite
and
he
exquisite
he
has
an
exquisite
mind
but
of
course
you
know
what
a
good
sort
he
is
seems
rather
to
look
at
life
than
to
act
in
it
does
he
continued
aylmer
a
brilliant
sort
of
spectator
vincy
thinks
that
all
the
world
a
stage
but
always
in
the
front
row
of
the
stalls
i
never
could
be
like
that
i
always
want
to
be
right
in
the
thick
of
it
on
in
every
scene
and
always
performing
an
audience
said
edith
he
smiled
and
went
on
so
jolly
about
him
is
that
though
he
so
quiet
yet
genial
not
chilly
and
reserved
he
frank
i
mean
and
confiding
without
ever
saying
much
he
expresses
himself
in
his
own
way
quite
true
after
all
it
really
only
expression
that
makes
things
real
you
do
talk
about
a
thing
it
has
never
happened
it
does
always
follow
that
a
thing
has
happened
because
you
do
talk
about
it
said
edith
mrs
mitchell
going
she
floated
away
he
remained
in
a
rather
ecstatic
state
of
absence
of
mind
mrs
mitchell
gladly
told
edith
all
about
aylmer
ross
how
clever
he
was
how
nice
how
devoted
to
his
little
boy
he
had
married
very
young
it
seemed
and
had
lost
his
wife
two
years
after
this
was
ten
years
ago
and
according
to
mrs
mitchell
he
had
never
looked
at
another
woman
since
women
love
to
simplify
in
this
sentimental
way
she
said
consolingly
still
quite
young
under
forty
and
he
sure
to
fall
in
love
and
marry
again
doubt
said
edith
wishing
the
first
wife
had
remained
alive
she
disliked
the
second
one
nearly
all
the
men
had
now
joined
the
ladies
in
the
studio
with
the
exception
of
bruce
and
of
aylmer
ross
mrs
mitchell
had
taken
an
immense
fancy
to
edith
and
showed
it
by
telling
her
all
about
a
wonderful
little
tailor
who
made
coats
and
skirts
better
than
lucile
for
next
to
nothing
and
by
introducing
to
her
lord
rye
and
the
embassy
man
and
mr
cricker
edith
was
sitting
in
a
becoming
corner
under
a
shaded
light
from
which
she
could
watch
the
door
when
vincy
came
up
to
talk
to
her
seemed
to
get
on
rather
well
at
dinner
he
said
is
captain
willis
a
dear
simply
sweet
so
bright
and
clever
i
was
sure
you
like
him
edith
captain
willis
here
came
up
and
said
a
shade
more
jovially
than
he
had
spoken
at
dinner
with
his
laugh
you
know
mrs
ottley
what
i
always
say
is
live
and
let
live
and
let
it
go
at
that
what
but
they
never
you
know
they
wo
and
there
it
is
edith
now
did
a
thing
she
had
never
done
in
her
life
before
and
which
was
entirely
unlike
her
she
tried
her
utmost
to
retain
the
group
round
her
and
to
hold
their
attention
for
a
reason
of
which
she
was
hardly
conscious
she
wanted
aylmer
ross
to
see
her
surrounded
the
minister
from
the
place
with
a
name
like
ruritania
was
so
immensely
bowled
over
that
he
was
already
murmuring
in
a
low
voice
almost
a
hiss
as
they
say
in
melodrama
êtes
chez
vous
quand
dites
un
mot
un
mot
seulement
et
je
me
précipiterai
à
vos
while
at
the
same
time
in
her
other
ear
lord
rye
was
explaining
to
her
pretended
intense
interest
how
he
could
play
the
whole
of
the
chocolate
and
by
ear
without
a
single
mistake
sound
grumbled
captain
willis
why
do
it
vincy
was
listening
enjoying
himself
bruce
came
in
at
last
evidently
engaged
in
an
absorbed
and
intimate
conversation
with
aylmer
ross
they
seemed
so
much
interested
in
their
talk
that
they
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
sat
down
there
together
aylmer
gave
her
one
glance
only
edith
was
unreasonably
annoyed
what
on
earth
could
he
and
bruce
find
to
talk
about
at
length
growing
tired
of
her
position
she
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
to
look
at
a
picture
on
the
wall
turning
her
graceful
back
to
the
room
bruce
had
now
at
last
left
his
companion
but
still
aylmer
ross
did
not
go
and
speak
to
her
though
he
was
sitting
alone
musical
chairs
began
in
the
studio
someone
was
playing
stopping
suddenly
in
the
middle
to
shouts
of
laughter
and
shrieks
from
the
romping
players
in
the
some
of
the
people
were
playing
bridge
how
dull
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
just
before
the
party
practically
broke
up
edith
had
an
opportunity
of
saying
as
she
passed
aylmer
thought
we
were
going
to
have
a
talk
instead
of
playing
games
saw
you
were
occupied
he
answered
ceremoniously
like
to
interrupt
she
laughed
this
a
jealous
scene
mr
ross
wonder
he
said
smiling
if
so
whose
well
i
hope
to
see
you
again
soon
a
success
your
charming
wife
has
had
tonight
said
mrs
mitchell
to
bruce
as
they
took
leave
is
quite
wild
about
her
how
pretty
she
is
you
be
proud
of
her
they
were
nearly
the
last
mr
cricker
who
had
firmly
refused
the
whole
evening
in
spite
of
abject
entreaties
to
dance
like
nijinsky
suddenly
relented
when
everyone
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
was
leaping
alone
in
the
studio
while
lord
rye
always
a
great
lingerer
was
playing
richard
strauss
to
himself
on
the
baby
grand
and
smoking
a
huge
cigar
said
bruce
solemnly
as
they
drove
away
made
a
friend
tonight
there
was
one
really
charming
man
there
he
took
an
immense
fancy
to
me
who
was
that
was
that
he
mimicked
her
but
quite
stupid
women
are
in
some
things
why
aylmer
ross
the
chap
who
sat
next
to
you
at
dinner
i
suppose
you
did
appreciate
him
very
clever
very
interesting
he
was
anxious
to
know
several
things
which
i
was
glad
to
be
in
a
position
to
tell
him
yes
an
awfully
good
sort
i
asked
him
to
dine
at
my
club
one
day
to
go
on
with
our
conversation
did
you
why
should
i
however
it
seems
from
what
he
said
that
he
thinks
the
carlton
nicer
for
a
talk
so
i
going
to
ask
him
there
instead
you
can
come
too
dear
he
wo
mind
it
wo
prevent
our
talking
are
we
going
to
give
a
dinner
at
the
carlton
wish
you
would
oppose
me
edith
once
in
a
way
of
course
i
shall
our
flat
too
small
to
give
a
decent
dinner
he
one
of
the
nicest
chaps
i
ever
met
do
you
want
me
to
write
tomorrow
morning
then
dear
no
i
have
asked
him
already
really
which
day
i
suggested
next
thursday
but
he
thought
tomorrow
would
be
better
he
engaged
for
every
other
day
now
do
go
and
say
engaged
tomorrow
if
you
are
you
have
to
chuck
it
no
i
not
engaged
mentally
rearranging
her
evening
dress
edith
drove
home
thoughtfully
she
was
attracted
and
did
not
know
why
and
for
the
first
time
hoped
she
had
made
an
impression
it
had
been
a
long
evening
and
her
headache
she
said
necessitated
solitude
and
darkness
at
once
right
i
got
a
much
worse
headache
gout
i
think
but
never
mind
about
me
do
be
anxious
dear
i
say
that
miss
mooney
is
a
very
charming
woman
she
took
rather
a
fancy
to
me
edith
er
you
might
ask
her
to
dinner
too
if
you
like
to
make
a
fourth
really
ought
we
to
snatch
all
the
mitchells
friends
the
first
time
bruce
of
course
it
only
courteous
it
all
right
one
must
return
their
hospitality
chapter
vi
the
visit
the
following
afternoon
edith
was
standing
by
the
piano
in
her
condensed
white
trying
over
a
song
which
she
was
accompanying
with
one
hand
when
to
her
surprise
the
maid
announced
aylmer
ross
it
was
a
warm
day
and
though
there
was
a
fire
the
windows
were
open
letting
in
the
scent
of
the
mauve
and
pink
hyacinths
in
the
little
she
thought
as
she
came
forward
to
meet
him
that
he
seemed
entirely
different
from
last
night
her
first
impression
was
that
he
was
too
big
for
the
room
her
second
that
he
was
very
handsome
and
also
a
little
agitated
really
hardly
know
how
to
apologise
mrs
ottley
i
ought
to
have
turned
up
in
this
cool
way
but
your
husband
has
kindly
asked
me
to
dine
with
you
tonight
and
i
was
sure
of
the
time
i
thought
come
and
ask
you
he
waited
a
minute
course
if
i
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
find
you
in
i
should
just
have
left
a
note
he
looked
round
the
room
obviously
it
was
quite
unnecessary
for
him
to
have
called
he
could
have
sent
the
note
that
he
had
brought
with
him
she
was
flattered
she
thought
that
she
liked
his
voice
and
the
flash
of
his
white
teeth
when
he
smiled
i
glad
i
at
home
she
said
in
a
gentle
way
that
put
him
at
his
ease
and
yet
at
an
immense
distance
felt
in
the
mood
to
stop
at
home
and
play
the
piano
today
i
delighted
to
see
you
they
sat
down
by
the
fire
at
eight
tonight
shall
we
have
tea
no
thanks
is
it
too
early
i
keep
you
a
moment
thanks
very
much
you
were
playing
something
when
i
came
in
i
wish
play
it
to
me
over
again
nine
women
out
of
ten
would
have
refused
saying
they
knew
nothing
of
music
or
that
they
were
out
of
practice
or
that
they
never
played
except
for
their
own
amusement
or
something
of
the
kind
especially
if
they
took
no
pride
whatever
in
that
accomplishment
but
edith
went
back
to
the
piano
at
once
and
went
on
trying
over
the
song
that
she
know
without
making
any
excuse
for
the
faltering
notes
charming
he
said
tosti
of
course
she
came
back
to
the
fireplace
course
we
had
great
fun
last
night
did
we
enjoyed
myself
immensely
part
of
the
time
at
least
after
dinner
you
were
rather
horrid
mr
ross
you
would
come
and
talk
to
me
would
you
i
i
was
afraid
tell
me
do
i
seem
many
years
older
since
last
night
he
asked
do
see
any
difference
why
i
lived
months
almost
years
since
i
saw
you
last
time
does
go
by
hours
does
it
what
a
charming
little
room
this
is
it
suits
you
there
hardly
anything
in
it
but
everything
is
right
do
like
to
have
many
things
in
a
room
said
edith
holding
out
her
delicate
hands
to
the
fire
makes
me
nervous
i
have
gradually
accustomed
bruce
to
my
idea
by
removing
one
thing
at
a
time
photographs
pictures
horrid
old
wedding
presents
all
the
little
things
people
have
they
suggest
too
many
different
trains
of
thought
they
worry
me
he
getting
used
to
it
now
he
says
soon
there
be
nothing
left
but
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
bookcase
how
right
i
had
rather
the
same
idea
in
my
house
but
i
could
keep
it
up
it
different
for
a
man
alone
things
seem
to
accumulate
especially
pictures
i
know
such
a
lot
of
artists
i
very
unfortunate
in
that
respect
i
really
feel
i
ought
to
have
turned
up
like
this
mrs
ottley
not
very
kind
excuse
my
country
manners
but
how
nice
your
husband
is
he
was
very
kind
to
me
liked
very
much
too
seems
charming
he
repeated
then
said
with
a
change
of
tone
and
with
his
occasional
impulsive
brusqueness
wonder
does
he
ever
jar
on
you
in
any
way
no
never
he
could
he
amuses
me
edith
replied
softly
does
he
if
i
had
the
opportunity
i
wonder
if
i
should
you
he
spoke
thoughtfully
i
do
think
you
would
at
all
said
edith
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
quite
fair
he
laughed
and
seemed
rather
pleased
mean
i
should
bore
you
to
death
do
forgive
me
mrs
ottley
let
go
on
with
our
talk
of
last
night
i
feel
it
rather
like
the
palace
of
truth
here
i
do
know
why
there
must
be
something
in
the
atmosphere
i
seem
to
find
it
difficult
not
to
think
aloud
vincy
now
do
you
see
much
of
vincy
yes
he
comes
here
most
days
or
we
talk
on
the
telephone
see
he
your
confidant
and
you
his
dear
vincy
by
the
way
he
asked
me
last
night
to
go
to
a
at
his
flat
next
week
he
was
going
to
ask
one
or
two
other
kindred
spirits
as
i
think
called
to
see
something
some
collection
including
you
of
course
shall
certainly
go
said
edith
he
asks
me
or
not
aylmer
seemed
to
be
trying
to
leave
he
nearly
got
up
once
or
twice
and
sat
down
again
i
shall
see
you
tonight
he
said
eight
shall
you
wear
mrs
ottley
i
thought
perhaps
my
mauve
chiffon
what
do
you
advise
she
smiled
what
you
wore
last
night
no
was
very
jolly
i
liked
it
er
red
was
it
no
it
was
pink
she
answered
then
there
was
an
extraordinary
pause
in
which
neither
of
them
seemed
able
to
think
of
anything
to
say
there
was
a
curious
sort
of
vibration
in
the
air
it
getting
quite
springy
said
edith
as
she
glanced
at
the
window
one
of
those
sort
of
warm
days
that
seem
to
have
got
mixed
up
by
mistake
with
the
winter
was
his
reply
which
was
not
very
relevant
another
pause
was
beginning
vincy
announced
the
servant
he
was
received
with
enthusiasm
and
aylmer
ross
now
recovered
his
ease
and
soon
went
away
said
vincy
in
a
reproving
tone
how
soon
came
to
know
what
time
we
dine
he
was
just
passing
yes
he
would
want
to
know
he
lives
in
jermyn
street
i
suppose
knightsbridge
is
on
his
way
to
there
where
she
asked
here
said
vincy
happened
after
we
left
said
edith
saw
the
cricker
man
beginning
to
dance
with
hardly
anyone
looking
at
him
his
imitation
of
nijinsky
wonderful
asked
vincy
marvellous
i
thought
he
was
imitating
george
grossmith
do
you
know
i
love
the
mitchells
vincy
it
really
great
fun
there
fancy
bruce
seems
so
delighted
with
aylmer
ross
and
miss
mooney
that
he
insisted
on
their
both
dining
with
us
tonight
seemed
rather
carried
away
i
thought
there
a
fascination
about
aylmer
there
are
so
many
things
he
not
said
vincy
me
some
of
them
for
one
thing
he
not
fatuous
though
he
so
he
not
a
sort
of
person
or
anything
else
tedious
she
was
delighted
at
this
especially
he
took
a
fancy
to
a
person
well
it
might
be
rather
serious
if
you
take
my
meaning
said
vincy
sweet
of
him
so
unusual
do
you
like
myra
mooney
oh
rather
i
devoted
to
her
she
a
delightful
type
get
her
on
to
the
subject
of
the
red
carnations
she
splendid
about
them
she
received
them
every
day
at
for
fifteen
years
another
jolly
thing
about
aylmer
is
that
he
has
none
of
that
awful
modernness
thank
goodness
i
noticed
that
suppose
he
was
brilliant
today
he
was
too
thrilled
but
do
be
just
a
teeny
bit
careful
edith
dear
because
when
he
is
at
all
very
much
so
do
you
see
a
lot
you
seem
to
think
of
one
little
visit
vincy
after
all
it
was
only
one
has
been
time
yet
for
many
more
has
there
edith
dear
he
could
hardly
call
twice
the
same
day
on
the
first
day
too
yes
i
come
over
quite
queer
and
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
in
a
manner
of
speaking
when
i
clapped
eyes
on
him
setting
here
edith
liked
vincy
to
talk
in
his
favourite
cockney
strain
it
contrasted
pleasantly
with
his
soft
even
voice
and
appearance
bruce
she
said
bruce
came
in
carrying
an
enormous
basket
of
gilded
straw
it
was
filled
with
white
heather
violets
lilies
jonquils
gardenias
and
mimosa
the
handle
was
trimmed
with
mauve
ribbon
bruce
how
angelic
of
you
be
in
such
a
hurry
dear
these
are
not
from
me
they
arrived
just
at
the
same
time
that
i
did
brought
by
a
commissionaire
there
was
hardly
room
for
it
in
the
lift
edith
looked
quickly
at
the
card
it
bore
the
name
of
the
minister
of
the
place
with
a
name
like
ruritania
cheek
exclaimed
bruce
who
was
really
flattered
infernal
impertinence
upon
my
word
i
more
than
half
a
mind
to
go
and
tell
him
what
i
think
of
him
straight
from
the
shoulder
what
the
address
square
i
do
care
i
shall
go
straight
to
the
embassy
said
bruce
i
i
send
them
back
and
write
him
a
line
tell
him
that
englishwomen
are
not
in
the
habit
of
accepting
presents
from
undesirable
aliens
i
consider
it
a
great
liberty
are
i
right
vincy
but
perhaps
he
means
no

the

but
i
like
one
at

too
miscellaneous
and
crowded
women
are
never
satisfied
it
very
rude
and
ungrateful
to
the
poor
old
man
who
meant

nice
no
doubt
and
to
show
his
respect
for
englishwomen

let

chapter
vii
coup
de
foudre
when
aylmer
ross
got
back
to
the
little
brown
house
in
jermyn
street
he
went
to
his
library
and
took
from
a
certain
drawer
an
ivory
miniature
framed
in
black
he
looked
at
it
for
some
time
it
had
a
sweet
face
with
a
very
high
forehead
blue
eyes
and
dark
hair
arranged
in
two
festoons
of
plaits
turned
up
at
the
sides
it
represented
his
mother
in
the
early
sixties
and
he
thought
it
was
like
edith
he
had
a
great
devotion
and
cult
for
the
memory
of
his
mother
when
he
was
charmed
with
a
woman
he
always
imagined
her
to
be
like
his
mother
he
had
never
thought
this
about
his
wife
people
had
said
how
extraordinarily
aylmer
must
have
been
in
love
to
have
married
that
uninteresting
girl
in
particular
not
pretty
and
a
little
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
marriage
had
happened
entirely
by
accident
it
had
occurred
through
a
misunderstanding
during
a
game
of
consequences
in
a
country
house
she
was
terribly
literal
having
taken
some
joke
of
his
seriously
she
had
sent
him
a
touchingly
coy
letter
saying
she
was
overwhelmed
at
his
offer
feeling
she
was
hardly
worthy
to
be
his
wife
and
must
think
it
over
he
did
not
like
to
hurt
her
feelings
by
explaining
and
when
she
relented
and
accepted
him
he
could
bear
to
tell
her
the
truth
he
was
absurdly
and
he
thought
that
after
all
it
did
matter
so
very
much
the
little
house
left
him
by
his
mother
needed
a
mistress
he
would
probably
marry
somebody
or
other
anyhow
and
she
seemed
such
a
harmless
little
thing
it
would
please
her
so
much
when
the
hurried
marriage
had
come
to
a
pathetic
end
by
her
early
death
everyone
was
tragic
about
it
except
aylmer
all
his
friends
declared
he
was
and
lonely
and
would
never
marry
again
he
had
indeed
been
shocked
and
grieved
at
her
death
but
only
for
her
not
at
being
left
alone
that
part
was
a
relief
the
poor
little
late
mrs
aylmer
ross
had
turned
out
a
terrible
mistake
she
had
said
the
wrong
thing
from
morning
till
night
and
combining
a
prim
refined
manner
with
a
vulgar
point
of
view
had
been
in
every
way
dreadfully
impossible
he
had
really
been
patience
and
unselfishness
itself
to
her
but
he
had
suffered
the
fact
was
he
had
never
even
liked
her
that
was
the
reason
he
had
not
married
again
but
he
was
devoted
to
his
boy
in
a
quiet
way
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
is
adored
by
children
animals
servants
and
women
tall
strong
and
handsome
with
intelligence
beyond
the
average
yet
with
nothing
alarming
about
him
about
trifles
jealous
in
matters
of
love
perhaps
that
is
after
all
the
type
women
really
like
best
it
is
sheer
nonsense
to
say
that
women
enjoy
being
tyrannised
over
no
doubt
there
are
some
who
would
rather
be
bullied
than
ignored
but
the
hectoring
man
is
with
few
exceptions
secretly
detested
in
so
far
as
one
can
generalise
always
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
it
may
be
said
that
women
like
best
a
kind
clever
man
who
can
be
always
trusted
and
occasionally
if
necessary
deceived
aylmer
hardly
ever
got
angry
except
in
an
argument
about
ideas
yet
his
feelings
were
violent
he
was
impulsive
and
under
his
suave
and
manner
emotional
he
was
certainly
but
had
he
not
been
he
would
have
pleased
all
the
same
he
seemed
to
radiate
warmth
life
a
certain
careless
to
be
near
him
was
like
warming
one
hands
at
a
warm
fire
superficially
susceptible
and
inclined
to
be
experimental
he
had
not
the
instinct
of
the
collector
and
was
devoid
of
fatuousness
but
he
could
have
had
more
genuine
successes
than
all
the
don
juans
and
romeos
and
fausts
who
ever
climbed
rope
ladders
besides
his
physical
attraction
he
inspired
a
feeling
of
reliance
women
felt
safe
with
him
he
would
never
treat
anyone
badly
he
inspired
that
kind
of
trust
enormously
in
men
also
and
his
house
was
constantly
filled
with
people
asking
his
advice
and
begging
him
to
do
things
sometimes
not
very
easy
ones
he
was
always
being
left
guardian
to
young
persons
who
would
never
require
one
and
said
himself
he
had
become
almost
a
professional
trustee
as
aylmer
was
generous
and
very
extravagant
in
a
way
of
his
own
though
he
cared
nothing
for
show
he
really
worked
hard
at
the
bar
to
add
to
his
already
large
income
he
always
wanted
a
great
deal
of
money
he
required
ease
margin
and
he
had
no
special
hobbies
but
he
needed
luxury
in
general
of
a
kind
and
especially
the
luxury
of
getting
things
in
a
hurry
his
theory
being
that
everything
comes
to
the
man
who
wo
wait
he
was
not
above
detesting
little
material
hardships
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
for
instance
even
in
his
youngest
days
who
would
go
by
omnibus
to
the
gallery
to
the
opera
to
hear
a
favourite
singer
or
a
special
performance
not
that
he
had
the
faintest
tinge
of
snobbishness
but
simply
because
such
trifling
drawbacks
irritated
him
and
spoilt
his
pleasure
impressionistic
as
he
was
in
life
on
the
other
hand
curiously
aylmer
real
taste
in
art
and
decoration
was
delicate
detailed
and
meticulous
almost
to
preciousness
he
often
had
delightful
things
in
his
house
but
never
for
long
he
had
no
pleasure
in
property
valuable
possessions
worried
him
and
after
any
amount
of
trouble
to
get
some
object
of
art
he
would
often
give
it
away
the
next
week
for
he
really
liked
money
only
for
freedom
and
ease
the
general
look
of
the
house
was
consequently
distinguished
sincere
and
extremely
comfortable
it
was
neither
hackneyed
nor
bizarre
and
while
it
contained
some
interesting
things
had
no
superfluities
aylmer
had
been
spoilt
as
a
boy
and
was
still
wilful
and
a
little
impatient
for
instance
he
could
never
wait
even
for
a
but
always
sent
his
notes
by
taxi
to
wait
for
an
answer
and
now
he
wanted
something
in
a
hurry
and
was
very
much
afraid
he
would
never
get
it
aylmer
was
as
i
have
said
often
a
little
susceptible
this
time
he
felt
completely
bowled
over
he
had
only
seen
her
twice
that
made
no
difference
the
truth
was
it
sounds
romantic
but
is
really
scientific
all
romance
being
perhaps
based
on
science
that
edith
appearance
corresponded
in
every
particular
with
an
ideal
that
had
grown
up
with
him
whether
he
had
seen
some
picture
as
a
child
that
had
left
a
vague
and
lasting
impression
or
whatever
the
reason
was
the
moment
he
saw
her
he
felt
with
a
curious
mental
sensation
as
of
something
that
fell
into
its
place
with
a
click
y
est
that
she
realised
some
dream
in
fact
it
was
a
rare
and
genuine
case
of
de
had
she
been
a
girl
he
would
have
proposed
to
her
the
next
day
and
they
might
quite
possibly
have
married
in
a
month
and
lived
happily
ever
after
these
things
occasionally
happen
but
she
was
married
already
had
she
been
a
fool
or
a
bore
a
silly
little
idiot
or
a
fisher
of
men
a
social
sham
who
prattled
of
duchesses
or
a
strenuous
feminine
politician
who
babbled
of
votes
a
christian
scientist
bent
on
converting
an
adventuress
without
adventures
the
worst
kind
a
or
a
a
or
even
a
lady
novelist
it
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
whatever
she
had
been
mentally
or
morally
he
would
undoubtedly
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
physically
at
first
sight
but
it
was
very
much
worse
than
that
he
found
her
delightful
and
clever
he
was
certain
she
was
an
angel
she
was
married
to
ottley
ottley
was
all
right
rather
an
ass
rather
ridiculous
apparently
in
every
way
but
one
so
absurdly
hard
hit
was
aylmer
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
to
see
her
again
as
soon
as
possible
was
already
the
sole
object
in
his
life
did
she
like
him
intuitively
he
felt
that
during
his
little
visit
his
intense
feeling
had
radiated
and
not
displeased
perhaps
a
little
impressed
her
he
could
easily
he
knew
form
a
friendship
with
them
arrange
to
see
her
often
he
was
going
to
meet
her
tonight
through
his
own
arrangement
he
would
get
them
to
come
and
dine
with
him
soon
no
the
next
day
what
was
the
good
well
where
was
the
harm
aylmer
had
about
the
same
code
of
morals
as
the
best
of
his
numerous
friends
in
bohemia
in
clubland
and
in
social
london
he
was
no
more
scrupulous
on
most
subjects
than
the
ordinary
man
of
his
own
class
still
had
been
married
that
made
an
immense
difference
for
he
was
positively
capable
of
seeing
and
with
sympathy
from
the
husband
point
of
view
even
now
indifferent
as
he
had
been
to
his
own
wife
and
after
ten
years
it
would
have
caused
him
pain
and
fury
had
he
found
out
that
she
had
ever
tried
to
play
him
false
of
course
cases
varied
he
knew
that
if
edith
had
been
free
his
one
thought
would
have
been
to
marry
her
had
she
been
different
and
differently
placed
he
would
have
blindly
tried
for
anything
he
could
get
in
any
possible
way
but
as
she
was
he
felt
convinced
he
could
never
succeed
in
making
her
care
for
him
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
it
and
supposing
even
that
he
could
and
here
came
in
the
delicacy
and
scruple
of
the
man
who
had
been
married
himself
he
thought
he
would
even
wish
to
spoil
by
the
vulgarity
of
compromising
or
by
the
shadow
of
a
secret
the
serenity
of
her
face
the
gay
prettiness
of
that
life
no
he
would
if
he
could
and
yet
how
exciting
it
would
be
to
rouse
her
from
that
cool
composure
she
was
rather
enigmatic
but
he
thought
she
could
be
roused
and
she
was
so
clever
how
well
she
would
carry
it
off
how
she
would
never
bore
a
man
and
he
suddenly
imagined
a
day
with
her
in
the
country
then
he
thought
that
his
imagination
was
flying
on
far
too
fast
he
decided
not
to
be
a
hopeless
fool
but
just
to
go
ahead
and
talk
to
her
and
get
to
know
her
not
to
think
too
much
about
her
she
need
even
know
how
he
felt
to
idolise
her
from
a
distance
would
be
quite
delightful
enough
when
a
passion
is
not
realised
he
thought
it
fades
away
or
becomes
ideal
worship
dante
petrarch
that
sort
of
thing
it
could
never
fade
away
in
this
case
he
was
sure
how
pretty
she
was
how
lovely
her
mouth
was
when
she
smiled
she
had
no
prejudices
apparently
no
affectations
how
she
played
and
sang
that
song
again
when
he
asked
her
with
what
a
delightful
sense
of
humour
she
had
dealt
with
him
and
also
with
bruce
at
the
mitchells
ottley
must
be
a
little
difficult
sometimes
she
had
read
and
thought
she
had
the
same
tastes
as
he
he
wondered
if
she
would
have
liked
that
thing
in
on
gardens
that
he
had
just
read
he
began
looking
for
it
he
thought
he
would
send
it
to
her
asking
her
opinion
then
he
would
get
an
answer
and
see
her
handwriting
you
do
know
a
woman
until
you
have
had
a
letter
from
her
but
no
what
a
fool
he
would
look
besides
he
was
going
to
see
her
tonight
it
was
about
time
to
get
ready
knowing
subconsciously
that
he
had
made
some
slight
favourable
impression
at
any
rate
that
he
had
repelled
or
bored
her
he
dressed
with
all
the
anxiety
joy
and
thrills
of
excitement
of
a
boy
of
twenty
and
no
boy
of
twenty
can
ever
feel
these
things
as
keenly
or
half
as
elaborately
as
a
man
nearly
twice
that
age
since
all
the
added
experiences
disillusions
practice
knowledge
and
life
of
the
additional
years
help
to
form
a
part
of
the
same
emotion
making
it
infinitely
deeper
and
all
the
stronger
because
so
much
more
and
conscious
of
itself
he
seemed
so
nervous
while
dressing
that
soames
the
valet
to
whom
he
was
a
hero
ventured
respectfully
to
hope
there
was
nothing
wrong
i
all
right
said
aylmer
never
ill
i
think
soames
i
shall
probably
die
of
middle
age
he
went
out
laughing
leaving
the
valet
smiling
coldly
out
of
politeness
soames
never
understood
any
kind
of
jest
he
took
himself
and
everyone
else
seriously
but
he
already
knew
perfectly
well
that
his
master
had
fallen
in
love
last
night
and
he
disapproved
very
strongly
he
thought
all
that
sort
of
thing
ought
to
be
put
a
stop
to

i
really
do
know
what
to

it
shows
talent

the

it
naughty
of
him
to
have
written
what

a
little
girl
and
weaker
than
you
did
remember
archie
i
make
it
up
if
she
begs
my
pardon
not
unless
she
does
i
said
archie
magnanimously
shall
certainly
not
allow
her
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
at
this
moment
dilly
came
in
with
her
finger
in
her
tiny
mouth
and
went
up
to
archie
drawling
with
a
pout
and
in
a
whining
voice
did
mean
to
archie
beamed
at
once
all
right
dilly
he
said
forgivingly
then
he
turned
to
his
mother
have
you
got
that
paper
i
have
indeed
cross
out
that
and
put
in
aspasia
matilda
ottley
sorry
dilly
he
kissed
her
and
they
ran
off
together
hand
in
hand
looking
like
cherubs
and
laughing
musically
chapter
ix
aylmer
at
the
carlton
aylmer
had
easily
persuaded
bruce
and
edith
to
dine
with
him
next
day
although
they
were
engaged
to
the
elder
mrs
ottley
already
he
said
he
expected
two
or
three
friends
and
he
convinced
them
they
must
come
too
it
is
only
in
london
that
people
meet
for
the
first
time
at
a
friend
house
and
then
if
they
take
to
each
other
practically
live
together
for
weeks
after
no
matter
what
social
engagements
they
may
happen
to
have
these
are
all
thrown
aside
for
the
new
friend
london
people
with
all
their
correctness
are
really
more
unconventional
than
any
other
people
in
the
world
for
instance
in
paris
such
a
thing
could
never
happen
in
any
kind
of
unless
perhaps
it
were
among
artists
and
bohemians
and
even
then
it
would
be
their
great
object
to
prove
to
one
another
that
they
were
not
wanting
in
distractions
and
were
very
much
in
demand
the
lady
especially
would
make
the
man
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
seeing
her
again
from
calculation
to
make
herself
seem
of
more
value
such
solicitudes
would
never
even
occur
to
edith
but
she
had
a
scruple
about
throwing
over
old
mrs
ottley
your
mother
be
disappointed
edith
asked
dear
edith
you
can
safely
leave
that
to
me
of
course
she
be
disappointed
but
you
can
go
round
and
see
her
and
speak
to
her
nicely
and
tell
her
that
after
all
we
ca
come
because
we
got
another
engagement
am
i
to
tell
her
it
a
subsequent
one
otherwise
she
wonder
we
did
mention
it
before
be
in
a
hurry
dear
do
rush
things
remember
she
my
mother
perhaps
to
you
edith
it
seems
a
rather
idea
and
i
daresay
you
think
it
rot
but
to
me
there
something
very
sacred
about
the
idea
of
a
mother
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
looked
in
the
glass
dear
then
do
you
think
we
really
ought
to
have
kept
our
promise
to
dine
with
her
she
probably
be
looking
forward
to
it
i
daresay
she
asked
one
or
two
people
she
thinks
we
like
to
meet
us
alter
cases
edith
if
it
comes
to
that
aylmer
ross
has
got
two
or
three
people
coming
to
dine
with
him
whom
he
thinks
we
might
like
he
said
so
himself
that
why
he
asked
us
but
he
ca
have
asked
them
on
purpose
bruce
because
you
see
we
did
know
him
on
thursday
why
should
he
have
asked
them
on
purpose
you
argue
you
go
on
it
really
seems
to
me
you
getting
absurdly
exacting
and
touchy
edith
dear
i
believe
all
those
flowers
from
the
embassy
have
positively
turned
your
head
should
he
have
asked
them
on
purpose
you
admit
yourself
that
we
did
even
know
the
man
last
thursday
and
yet
you
expect
bruce
stopped
he
had
got
into
a
slight
tangle
edith
looked
away
she
had
not
quite
mastered
the
art
of
the
inward
smile
better
in
my
opinion
continued
bruce
walking
up
and
down
the
do
interrupt
me
in
your
impulsive
way
but
hear
me
out
it
would
be
far
more
kind
and
sensible
in
every
way
for
you
to
sit
right
down
at
that
little
take
out
your
stylographic
pen
and
write
and
tell
my
mother
that
i
have
a
bad
attack
of
influenza
yes
one
should
always
be
considerate
to
one
parents
i
suppose
it
really
is
the
way
i
was
brought
up
that
makes
me
feel
this
so
keenly
he
explained
edith
sat
down
to
the
bad
is
your
influenza
not
very
bad
because
it
would
worry
her
a
slight
stop
not
so
very
slight
we
must
let
her
think
it
the
ordinary
kind
and
then
she
think
it
catching
and
she
wo
come
here
for
a
few
days
and
that
will
avoid
our
going
into
the
matter
in
detail
which
would
be
better
she
thinks
it
catching
dear
she
want
archie
and
dilly
and
miss
townsend
and
nurse
to
go
and
stay
with
her
in
south
kensington
and
that
will
be
quite
an
affair
as
usual
very
thoughtful
of
you
you
a
clever
little
woman
sometimes
edith
wait
he
put
up
his
hand
with
a
gesture
frequent
with
him
like
a
policeman
stopping
the
traffic
at
hyde
park
corner
leave
out
the
influenza
altogether
and
just
say
i
caught
a
slight
chill
then
she
come
over
at
once
and
you
have
to
go
to
bed
dear
edith
said
bruce
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
there
no
need
that
i
should
be
laid
up
for
this
not
serious
he
was
beginning
to
believe
in
his
own
illness
as
usual
i
want
to
go
round
to
the
club
tonic
treatment
that
the
thing
that
often
the
very
best
thing
for
a
chill
this
sort
of
chill
ah
that
will
do
very
nicely
very
neatly
written
dear
as
soon
as
bruce
had
gone
out
edith
rang
up
the
elder
mrs
ottley
on
the
telephone
and
relieved
her
anxiety
in
advance
they
were
great
friends
the
sense
of
humour
possessed
by
her
took
the
sting
out
of
the
relationship
the
dinner
at
aylmer
house
was
a
great
success
bruce
enjoyed
himself
enormously
for
he
liked
nothing
better
in
the
world
than
to
give
his
opinion
and
aylmer
was
specially
anxious
for
his
view
as
to
the
authenticity
of
a
little
old
master
he
had
acquired
and
took
notes
also
of
a
word
of
advice
with
regard
to
electric
lighting
admitting
he
was
not
a
very
practical
man
and
bruce
evidently
was
edith
was
interested
and
pleased
to
go
to
the
house
of
her
new
friend
and
to
reconstruct
the
scene
as
it
must
have
been
when
mrs
aylmer
ross
had
been
there
freddy
the
boy
was
at
school
but
there
was
a
portrait
of
him
evidently
he
resembled
his
father
the
sketch
represented
him
with
the
same
broad
forehead
smooth
dense
light
hair
pale
blue
eyes
under
eyebrows
with
a
slight
frown
in
them
and
the
charming
mouth
rather
fully
curved
expressing
an
amiable
and
nature
the
boy
was
but
not
edith
thought
as
handsome
as
aylmer
the
only
other
woman
present
was
lady
everard
a
plump
talkative
woman
in
black
the
smiling
widow
of
lord
everard
and
well
known
for
her
lavish
musical
hospitality
and
her
vague
and
indiscriminate
good
nature
she
bristled
with
aigrettes
and
sparkled
with
diamonds
and
determination
she
was
marvellously
garrulous
about
nothing
in
particular
she
was
a
woman
who
never
stopped
talking
for
a
single
moment
but
in
a
way
that
resembled
leaking
rather
than
laying
down
the
law
tepidly
indifferently
and
rather
amusingly
she
prattled
on
without
ceasing
on
every
subject
under
the
sun
and
was
socially
a
valuable
help
because
where
she
was
there
was
never
an
awkward
pause
or
any
other
kind
vincy
was
there
and
young
cricker
whose
occasional
depressed
silences
were
alternated
with
what
he
called
a
certain
amount
of
sparkling
chaff
lady
everard
told
edith
that
she
felt
quite
like
a
sort
of
mother
to
aylmer
you
think
it
sad
mrs
ottley
she
said
when
they
were
alone
think
that
the
dear
fellow
has
no
wife
to
look
after
this
dear
little
house
it
always
seems
to
me
such
a
pity
but
still
i
always
say
at
any
rate
aylmer
married
once
and
that
more
than
most
of
them
do
nowadays
it
simply
horse
work
to
get
them
to
do
it
at
all
sometimes
i
think
it
perfectly
disgraceful
and
yet
i
ca
help
seeing
how
sensible
it
is
of
them
too
you
know
when
you
think
of
it
what
with
one
thing
and
another
what
does
a
man
of
the
present
day
need
a
wife
for
what
with
the
flats
where
everything
on
earth
is
done
for
them
and
the
kindness
of
friends
just
think
how
bachelors
are
spoilt
by
their
married
friends
and
their
clubs
and
the
frightful
expense
of
everything
it
seems
to
me
as
a
general
rule
that
the
average
man
must
be
madly
unselfish
or
a
perfect
idiot
to
marry
at
all
that
what
it
seems
to
me
do
you
when
you
think
of
all
the
responsibilities
they
take
upon
themselves
and
i
sure
there
are
not
many
modern
wives
who
expect
to
do
anything
on
earth
but
have
their
bills
and
bridge
debts
paid
and
their
perpetual
young
men
asked
to
dinner
and
one
thing
and
another
of
course
though
there
are
some
exceptions
she
smiled
amiably
tells
me
you
have
two
children
very
sweet
of
you
i
sure
what
darling
pets
they
must
be
angels
angels
oh
i
so
fond
of
children
but
particularly
it
funny
when
they
not
there
because
i
ca
stand
their
noise
now
my
little
grandchildren
my
daughter
eva
been
married
ten
years
lady
lindley
you
know
hers
are
perfect
pets
and
heavenly
angels
but
i
ca
stand
them
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
i
have
nerves
so
much
so
do
you
know
partly
because
i
go
in
a
good
deal
for
music
and
intellect
and
so
on
so
much
so
that
i
very
nearly
had
a
rest
cure
at
the
end
of
last
season
and
i
should
have
had
probably
but
that
new
young
french
singer
came
over
with
a
letter
of
introduction
to
me
and
of
course
i
could
desert
him
but
had
to
do
my
very
best
ever
heard
him
sing
yes
you
would
of
course
oh
how
wonderful
it
is
edith
waited
in
vain
for
a
pause
to
say
she
did
know
the
name
of
the
singer
lady
everard
went
on
leaning
comfortably
back
in
cricker
dances
very
prettily
too
he
came
to
one
of
my
evenings
and
had
quite
a
success
only
an
amateur
of
course
but
rather
nice
however
like
all
amateurs
he
wants
to
perform
only
when
people
would
rather
he
did
and
when
they
want
him
to
he
wo
he
refuses
that
the
amateur
all
over
the
professional
comes
up
to
the
scratch
when
wanted
and
stops
when
the
performance
is
not
required
it
all
the
difference
in
the
world
is
it
mrs
ottley
still
a
nice
boy
are
you
fond
of
music
really
fond
of
it
but
i
only
a
listener
lady
everard
seemed
delighted
and
brightened
up
you
do
sing
or
play
you
must
come
to
one
of
my
musical
evenings
we
have
all
the
stars
in
the
season
at
times
dear
melba
and
caruso
and
darling
bemberk
and
dear
debussy
oh
do
laugh
at
my
enthusiasm
my
dear
but
i
quite
and
then
of
course
we
have
any
amount
of
amateurs
and
all
the
new
young
professionals
that
are
coming
on
in
my
opinion
paul
la
france
that
the
young
man
i
was
telling
you
about
will
be
one
of
the
very
very
best
quite
at
the
top
of
the
tree
and
i
determined
he
shall
but
of
course
he
needs
care
and
encouragement
i
think
of
his
giving
a
in
which
lecture
on
his
own
singing
i
shall
be
on
the
platform
to
make
a
sort
of
introductory
speech
and
monti
of
course
will
accompany
he
is
the
only
accompanist
that
counts
but
then
i
suppose
he
been
accompanying
somebody
or
other
ever
since
he
was
a
little
boy
so
it
second
nature
to
him
and
you
must
come
and
bring
your
husband
does
he
go
with
you
to
places
very
nice
of
him
nowadays
if
husbands
and
wives
occasionally
go
to
the
same
parties
they
have
hardly
any
opportunity
of
meeting
at
all
that
what
i
always
say
but
then
of
course
still
almost
on
your
honeymoon
are
you
charming
in
the
cricker
was
confiding
in
aylmer
while
vincy
and
bruce
discussed
the
old
master
you
know
cricker
said
in
a
low
voice
this
girl
mania
for
me
i
get
wires
and
telephones
all
day
long
she
hardly
gives
me
time
to
shave
and
she
jolly
pretty
so
i
do
like
to
chuck
it
in
fact
i
dare
but
her
one
cry
is
cold
cold
she
says
i
as
cold
as
a
stone
what
do
you
thing
of
that
may
be
a
stone
and
a
rolling
one
at
that
said
aylmer
there
are
other
pebbles
on
the
beach
i
daresay
bet
not
one
of
them
as
stony
as
i
am
cried
cricker
cricker
came
a
little
nearer
lowering
his
voice
again
a
very
peculiar
case
he
said
proudly
course
it
always
is
see
she
frightfully
pretty
on
the
stage
and
married
one
of
the
most
awkward
positions
a
person
can
be
in
mind
you
i
sorry
for
her
i
thought
of
consulting
you
about
something
if
you
give
me
a
minute
or
two
old
chap
he
took
out
a
do
mean
ill
show
you
this
oh
no
i
ca
show
it
it
compromising
course
not
really
likes
to
show
a
really
lukewarm
love
letter
besides
it
would
hardly
be
cricker
put
the
case
back
my
dear
chap
i
was
going
to
show
it
to
you
i
should
dream
of
such
a
thing
to
anybody
but
i
was
just
going
to
read
you
out
a
sentence
from
which
you
can
form
an
opinion
of
my
predicament
it
no
good
mincing
matters
old
boy
the
woman
is
crazy
mad
about
me
there
you
got
it
straight
in
a
crazy
certainly
ca
be
very
sane
returned
aylmer
before
the
end
of
the
evening
aylmer
had
arranged
to
take
the
ottleys
to
see
a
play
that
was
having
a
run
after
this
he
dropped
in
to
tea
to
discuss
it
and
bruce
kept
him
to
dinner
day
after
day
went
on
and
they
saw
him
continually
he
had
never
shown
by
word
or
manner
any
more
of
his
sentiment
than
on
the
second
occasion
when
they
had
met
but
edith
was
growing
thoroughly
accustomed
to
this
new
interest
and
it
certainly
gave
a
zest
to
her
existence
for
she
knew
as
women
do
know
or
at
any
rate
she
believed
that
she
had
an
attraction
for
him
which
he
did
intend
to
give
away
the
situation
was
pleasant
and
notwithstanding
vincy
slight
anxiety
she
persisted
in
seeing
nothing
in
it
to
fear
in
any
way
aylmer
did
even
flirt
one
day
at
vincy
rooms
she
thought
he
seemed
different
vincy
with
all
his
gentle
manner
had
in
art
an
extraordinary
taste
for
brutality
and
violence
and
his
rooms
were
covered
with
pictures
by
futurists
and
cubists
wild
studies
by
wild
men
from
tahiti
and
a
curious
collection
of
savage
ornaments
and
weapons
do
quite
see
vincy
handling
that
chinese
sword
do
you
said
aylmer
laughing
nor
do
i
but
i
do
like
to
look
at
it
vincy
said
they
went
into
the
little
which
was
curiously
furnished
with
a
green
marble
narrow
as
in
the
pictures
of
the
last
supper
at
which
the
guests
could
sit
on
one
side
only
to
be
waited
on
from
the
other
on
it
as
decoration
it
was
laid
for
two
side
by
side
were
some
curious
straw
mats
a
few
laurel
leaves
a
little
marble
statuette
of
pan
and
three
tangerine
oranges
vincy
do
tell
me
what
are
you
going
to
eat
tonight
edith
exclaimed
you
with
other
people
i
can
never
imagine
you
sitting
down
to
a
proper
meal
eat
oh
a
nice
orange
i
think
said
he
sometimes
when
i
alone
i
just
have
a
nice
egg
and
a
glass
of
water
i
do
myself
very
well
worry
about
me
edith
when
they
were
alone
for
a
moment
aylmer
looked
out
of
the
window
it
was
rather
high
up
and
they
looked
down
on
the
hustling
crowds
of
people
pushing
along
through
the
warm
air
in
victoria
street
getting
decent
weather
he
said
quite
warm
they
always
suddenly
talked
commonplaces
when
they
were
first
left
alone
may
be
going
away
pretty
soon
he
said
away
oh
where
not
quite
sure
yet
there
was
a
pause
you
come
to
tea
tomorrow
wo
you
said
edith
indeed
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
i
shall
look
forward
to
it
at
five
he
spoke
formally
four
said
edith
shall
be
lunching
not
very
far
from
you
tomorrow
a
quarter
to
four
said
edith
wonder
who
this
other
place
is
laid
for
said
aylmer
looking
at
the
table
indiscreet
of
you
so
do
i
one
must
find
out
by
asking
heavens
no
cried
edith
an
extraordinary
idea
chapter
x
shopping
chez
soi
edith
was
expecting
aylmer
to
call
that
afternoon
before
he
went
away
she
was
surprised
to
find
how
perturbed
she
was
at
the
idea
of
his
going
away
he
had
become
almost
a
part
of
their
daily
existence
and
seeing
him
was
certainly
quite
the
most
amusing
and
exciting
experience
she
had
ever
had
and
now
it
was
coming
to
an
end
some
obscure
clairvoyance
told
her
that
his
leaving
and
telling
her
of
it
in
this
vague
way
had
some
reference
to
her
but
perhaps
she
thought
she
was
wrong
perhaps
it
was
simply
that
after
the
pleasant
intercourse
and
of
the
last
few
weeks
he
was
going
to
something
that
interested
him
more
he
was
a
widower
and
still
a
young
man
perhaps
he
was
in
love
with
someone
this
idea
was
far
from
agreeable
although
except
the
first
and
second
time
they
met
he
had
never
said
a
word
that
could
be
described
even
as
flirtation
he
showed
admiration
for
her
and
pleasure
in
her
society
but
he
rarely
saw
her
alone
the
few
visits
and
had
always
begun
by
conventional
commonplace
phrases
and
embarrassment
and
had
ended
in
a
delightful
sympathy
in
animated
conversation
in
a
flowing
confidence
and
gaiety
and
in
long
discussions
on
books
and
art
and
principally
people
that
was
all
in
fact
he
had
become
in
two
or
three
weeks
in
a
sense
de
la
they
went
everywhere
with
him
and
met
nearly
every
day
and
bruce
appeared
to
adore
him
it
was
entirely
different
from
her
long
and
really
intimate
friendship
with
vincy
vincy
was
her
confidant
her
friend
she
could
tell
everything
and
she
did
and
he
confided
in
her
and
told
her
all
except
one
side
of
his
life
of
which
she
was
aware
but
to
which
she
never
referred
this
was
his
secret
romance
with
a
certain
girl
artist
of
whom
he
never
spoke
although
edith
knew
that
some
day
he
would
tell
her
about
that
also
but
with
aylmer
there
was
and
would
always
be
less
real
freedom
and
impersonal
frankness
because
there
was
so
much
more
selfconsciousness
in
fact
because
there
was
an
unacknowledged
but
very
strong
mutual
physical
attraction
edith
had
however
felt
until
now
merely
the
agreeable
excitement
of
knowing
that
a
man
she
liked
and
in
whom
she
was
immensely
interested
was
growing
apparently
devoted
to
her
while
had
always
believed
that
she
would
know
how
to
deal
with
the
case
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
never
lead
to
anything
more
that
is
to
say
to
more
than
wished
and
now
he
was
going
away
why
and
where
however
the
first
thing
to
consider
was
that
she
would
see
him
today
the
result
of
this
consideration
was
the
obvious
one
she
must
do
some
shopping
edith
was
remarkably
feminine
in
every
attribute
in
manner
in
movement
and
in
appearance
indeed
for
a
woman
of
the
present
day
unusually
and
refreshingly
feminine
yet
she
had
certain
mental
characteristics
which
were
entirely
unlike
most
women
one
was
her
extreme
aversion
for
shops
and
indeed
for
going
into
any
concrete
little
details
it
has
been
said
that
her
feeling
for
dress
was
sure
and
unerring
but
it
was
entirely
that
of
the
artist
it
was
impressionistic
edith
was
very
clever
indeed
most
ingenious
in
managing
practical
affairs
as
long
as
she
was
the
director
the
general
of
the
campaign
but
she
did
not
like
carrying
out
in
detail
her
plans
she
liked
to
be
the
architect
not
the
workman
for
example
the
small
household
affairs
in
the
flat
went
on
wheels
everything
was
almost
always
perfect
but
edith
did
not
rattle
her
housekeeping
keys
or
count
the
coals
nor
did
she
even
go
through
accounts
or
into
the
kitchen
every
day
the
secret
was
simple
she
had
a
good
cook
and
housekeeper
who
managed
all
these
important
but
tedious
details
admirably
under
her
suggestions
in
order
to
do
this
edith
had
to
practise
a
little
fraud
on
bruce
a
justifiable
and
quite
unselfish
one
she
gave
the
cook
and
housekeeper
a
quarter
of
her
dress
allowance
in
addition
to
the
wages
bruce
considered
sufficient
because
bruce
believed
that
they
could
not
afford
more
than
a
certain
amount
for
a
cook
while
he
admitted
that
edith
who
had
a
few
hundred
pounds
a
year
of
her
own
might
need
to
spend
this
on
dress
very
little
of
it
went
on
dress
although
edith
was
not
very
economical
but
she
had
a
plan
of
her
own
she
knew
that
to
be
dressed
in
a
very
ordinary
style
that
is
to
say
simple
conventional
comme
il
faut
suited
her
by
throwing
her
unusual
beauty
into
relief
occasionally
a
touch
of
individuality
was
added
when
she
wanted
to
have
a
special
effect
but
she
never
entered
a
shop
very
rarely
interviewed
a
milliner
it
was
always
done
for
her
she
was
easy
to
dress
being
tall
slim
and
remarkably
pretty
she
thought
that
most
women
make
a
great
mistake
in
allowing
dress
to
be
the
master
instead
of
the
servant
of
their
good
looks
many
women
were
she
considered
entirely
crushed
and
made
insignificant
by
the
beauty
of
their
clothes
the
important
thing
was
to
have
a
distinguished
appearance
and
this
can
not
of
course
easily
be
obtained
without
expensive
elegance
but
edith
was
and
looked
younger
so
she
could
dress
simply
this
morning
edith
had
telephoned
to
her
friend
miss
bennett
an
old
schoolfellow
who
had
nothing
to
do
and
adored
commissions
edith
sitting
by
the
fire
or
at
the
gave
her
orders
which
were
always
decisive
short
and
yet
meticulous
miss
bennett
was
a
little
late
this
morning
and
edith
had
been
getting
quite
anxious
to
see
her
when
she
at
last
arrived
she
was
a
girl
with
a
small
hat
squashed
on
her
head
a
serge
coat
and
skirt
black
gloves
and
shoes
with
spats
edith
greeted
her
rather
reproachfully
with
late
grace
said
grace
the
name
suited
her
singularly
badly
she
was
plain
but
had
a
pleasant
face
a
pink
complexion
small
bright
eyes
protruding
teeth
and
a
scenario
for
a
figure
merely
a
collection
of
bones
on
which
a
dress
could
be
hung
she
was
devoted
to
edith
and
to
a
few
other
friends
of
both
sexes
of
whom
she
made
idols
she
was
hard
abrupt
enthusiastic
ignorant
and
humorous
but
i
had
to
do
a
lot
of
right
interrupted
edith
could
help
it
listen
to
what
i
want
you
to
do
ahead
said
miss
bennett
taking
out
a
and
pencil
edith
spoke
in
her
low
soft
impressive
voice
rather
slowly
anywhere
you
like
and
bring
me
back
two
or
three
perfectly
simple
you
know
the
sort
of
shape
rather
like
evening
cloaks
straight
lines
none
of
the
new
draperies
and
curves
in
red
blue
and
black
asked
miss
bennett
anything
you
like
but
made
of
liberty
satin
with
a
dull
surface
no
such
thing
grace
bennett
laughed
mean
charmeuse
or
perhaps
it
what
you
like
only
get
it
you
must
bring
them
back
in
a
taxi
girl
not
to
cost
more
than
oh
not
much
added
edith
the
most
woman
why
not
have
a
really
good
while
about
it
be
good
i
want
to
have
a
hard
outline
like
a
fergusson
really
what
that
mind
and
suppose
you
ca
get
the
shape
grace
some
evening
cloaks
the
kimonoish
kind
i
could
wear
one
over
a
lace
blouse
it
would
look
exactly
the
same
what
curious
ideas
you
have
but
you
right
enough
anything
else
said
miss
bennett
standing
up
ready
to
go
like
shopping
for
you
you
know
what
you
want
me
an
azalea
not
a
large
one
and
a
bit
of
some
dull
material
of
the
same
colour
to
drape
round
it
extraordinary
it
is
the
way
you
hate
anything
shiny
exclaimed
miss
bennett
making
a
note
know
i
only
like
effects
oh
and
in
case
i
choose
a
gown
get
me
just
one
very
large
black
velvet
orchid
too
that
all
edith
looked
at
her
shoes
they
were
perfect
tiny
pointed
and
made
of
black
suède
she
decided
they
would
do
that
all
dear
might
i
kindly
ask
said
miss
bennett
getting
up
particular
reason
for
all
this
are
you
going
to
have
the
flu
or
a
party
or
what
said
edith
who
was
always
frank
when
it
was
possible
expecting
a
visitor
who
never
seen
me
in
anything
but
a
coat
and
skirt
or
in
evening
dress
he
wants
a
change
does
he
be
vulgar
grace
thanks
awfully
dear
you
really
kind
they
both
laughed
and
edith
gently
pushed
her
friend
out
of
the
room
then
she
sat
down
on
a
sofa
put
up
her
feet
and
began
to
read
to
divert
her
thoughts
vincy
had
brought
it
to
convert
her
to
when
archie
and
dilly
were
out
and
edith
who
always
got
up
rather
early
was
alone
she
often
passed
her
morning
hours
in
reading
dreaming
playing
the
piano
or
even
in
thinking
she
was
one
of
the
few
women
who
really
can
think
and
enjoy
it
this
morning
she
soon
put
down
the
mad
clever
little
prophetic
oxford
journal
considering
she
was
usually
the
most
reposeful
woman
in
london
she
was
rather
restless
today
she
glanced
round
the
little
room
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
distract
or
irritate
or
even
to
suggest
a
train
of
thought
except
perhaps
the
books
everything
was
calming
and
soothing
with
a
touch
of
gaiety
in
the
lightness
of
the
wall
decorations
an
azalea
certainly
would
be
a
good
note
the
carpet
and
almost
everything
in
the
room
was
green
except
the
small
white
enamelled
piano
today
she
felt
that
she
wanted
to
use
all
her
influence
to
get
aylmer
to
confide
in
her
more
perhaps
he
was
slipping
away
from
her
she
would
have
been
only
a
little
incident
in
his
existence
while
she
certainly
wished
it
to
go
on
seeing
this
perhaps
it
ought
to
go
on
she
wondered
if
he
would
laugh
or
be
serious
today
whether
miss
bennett
had
come
up
in
the
lift
with
a
heap
of
cardboard
boxes
and
the
azalea
a
taxi
was
waiting
at
the
door
edith
opened
the
boxes
cutting
the
string
with
scissors
she
put
four
gowns
out
on
the
sofa
grace
explained
that
two
were
cloaks
two
were
gowns
all
she
could
get
the
one
said
edith
taking
out
one
of
a
deep
blue
colour
like
an
italian
sky
on
a
coloured
picture
it
had
a
collar
of
the
same
deep
blue
spotted
with
white
a
birdseye
effect
taking
off
her
coat
edith
slipped
the
gown
over
her
dress
and
went
to
her
room
followed
closely
by
miss
bennett
to
see
herself
in
the
long
mirror
said
edith
i
must
cut
off
those
buttons
i
hate
buttons
are
you
going
to
fasten
it
then
dear
hooks
and
eyes
marie
can
sew
them
on
the
deep
blue
with
the
white
spots
had
a
vivid
and
charming
effect
and
suited
her
blonde
colouring
she
saw
she
was
very
pretty
in
it
and
was
pleased
you
going
to
try
the
others
on
dear
asked
grace
what
the
good
this
one
will
do
then
i
take
them
back
sweet
wo
you
come
back
to
lunch
come
back
to
lunch
tomorrow
said
miss
bennett
you
can
tell
me
about
your
oh
and
here
a
little
bit
of
stuff
for
the
plant
i
suppose
you
put
the
azalea
into
the
large
pewter
vase
and
i
tie
this
round
its
neck
it
cotton
said
miss
bennett
could
get
any
silk
the
right
colour
i
like
cotton
if
only
it
not
called
sateen
darling
you
delightfully
quick
i
do
waste
time
said
miss
bennett
says
too
that
i
the
best
shopper
in
the
world
she
turned
round
to
add
dying
to
know
why
you
want
to
look
so
pretty
who
is
it
with
a
quiet
smile
edith
dismissed
her
chapter
xi
always
seems
to
me
so
unlike
you
aylmer
said
he
had
arrived
punctually
at
twenty
minutes
to
four
extreme
fondness
for
newspapers
you
quite
celebrated
as
a
collector
of
last
editions
are
you
know
it
very
unliterary
of
me
but
i
enjoy
reading
newspapers
better
than
reading
anything
else
in
the
world
after
all
contemporary
history
that
my
defence
but
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
so
intensely
interested
in
life
me
exactly
what
papers
do
you
really
read
she
laughed
morning
papers
never
mind
their
names
four
evening
papers
five
sunday
papers
academy
the
saturday
review
the
bookman
the
world
the
english
i
think
it
wicked
of
you
to
encourage
all
this
frivolity
and
what
price
queen
horrie
notes
or
the
we
have
those
too
for
bruce
does
archie
show
any
of
this
morbid
desire
for
journalism
yes
he
takes
in
and
little
i
see
you
reading
that
vincy
fault
of
course
it
is
do
you
find
time
for
all
this
culture
read
quickly
and
what
i
have
to
do
i
do
rather
quickly
that
why
you
never
seem
in
a
hurry
i
think
you
the
only
woman
i
know
in
london
do
think
i
solved
the
problem
of
i
reduced
it
to
a
science
not
working
i
suppose
wonderful
and
that
blue
you
really
think
so
he
was
beginning
to
get
carried
away
he
stood
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
pink
and
white
hyacinths
were
strongly
scented
in
the
warm
air
he
turned
round
she
said
demurely
will
be
nice
weather
for
you
to
go
away
now
wo
it
do
think
so
he
spoke
impulsively
shall
hate
it
i
shall
be
miserable
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
dying
to
ask
me
something
he
said
am
i
dying
to
ask
you
you
going
or
going
she
gave
her
most
vivid
smile
he
sat
down
with
a
sigh
people
still
sigh
sometimes
even
nowadays
do
know
where
i
going
but
i
tell
you
why
i
seeing
too
much
of
you
she
was
silent
see
mrs
ottley
seeing
a
great
deal
of
you
is
very
entrancing
but
it
dangerous
what
way
your
society
you
see
one
gets
to
feel
one
ca
do
without
it
do
you
see
why
should
you
do
without
it
he
looked
at
her
mean
there
no
reason
why
we
should
keep
on
going
to
plays
with
bruce
dining
with
bruce
being
always
with
bruce
bruce
and
aylmer
had
become
so
intimate
that
they
called
each
other
by
their
christian
names
you
see
it
makes
one
sometimes
feel
one
wants
more
and
more
of
you
of
your
society
i
mean
one
could
talk
better
alone
you
can
come
and
see
me
sometimes
ca
you
that
the
worst
of
all
he
answered
with
emphasis
aylmer
spoke
decidedly
not
a
man
who
could
ever
be
a
tame
cat
and
also
i
not
i
hope
a
man
who
who
would
dare
to
think
or
even
wish
to
spoil
to
is
that
really
why
you
going
she
asked
gently
forcing
me
to
answer
you
shall
you
soon
forget
all
about
it
he
changed
his
position
and
sat
next
to
her
on
the
sofa
so
you
wo
miss
me
a
bit
he
said
caressingly
care
if
you
never
saw
me
again
would
you
i
should
care
why
you
know
we
awfully
good
friends
i
like
you
immensely
much
as
vincy
so
differently
glad
of
that
at
any
rate
there
was
an
embarrassed
pause
this
is
really
the
last
time
i
to
see
you
for
ages
mrs
ottley
are
we
all
going
to
the
theatre
tomorrow
with
you
i
mean
bruce
said
so
yes
i
mean
the
last
time
alone
yes
i
got
a
box
for
moonshine
bruce
said
you
come
lady
everard
and
vincy
will
be
there
will
be
fun
i
love
that
sort
of
show
it
takes
one
right
away
from
life
instead
of
struggling
to
imitate
it
badly
like
most
plays
always
delightful
to
hear
what
you
say
and
anything
i
see
with
you
i
enjoy
and
believe
to
be
better
than
it
is
said
aylmer
know
you
cast
a
glamour
over
anything
but
the
next
day
i
going
away
for
three
months
at
least
long
time
it
will
it
seem
long
to
you
of
course
we
shall
i
shall
miss
you
very
much
i
told
you
so
he
insisted
she
smiled
they
looked
at
each
other
edith
felt
less
mistress
of
the
situation
than
she
had
expected
she
was
faced
with
a
choice
she
felt
it
she
knew
it
she
did
want
him
to
go
still
perhaps
there
was
a
vibration
in
the
air
suddenly
a
sharp
ring
was
heard
overpowered
by
a
sudden
impulse
aylmer
seized
her
impetuously
by
the
shoulders
kissed
her
roughly
and
at
random
before
she
could
stop
him
and
said
incoherently
i
love
you
edith
and
then
stood
up
by
the
mantelpiece
vincy
announced
the
servant
chapter
xii
moonshine
the
next
evening
bruce
and
edith
were
going
to
the
society
theatre
with
aylmer
it
was
their
last
meeting
before
he
was
to
go
away
edith
half
expected
that
he
would
put
it
off
but
there
was
no
change
made
in
the
plans
and
they
met
in
the
box
as
arranged
aylmer
had
expected
during
the
whole
day
to
hear
that
she
had
managed
to
postpone
the
party
at
one
moment
he
was
frightened
and
rather
horrified
when
he
thought
of
what
he
had
done
at
another
he
was
delighted
and
enchanted
about
it
and
told
himself
that
it
was
absolutely
justified
after
all
he
could
do
more
than
go
away
if
he
found
he
was
too
fond
of
her
no
hero
of
romance
could
be
expected
to
do
more
than
that
and
he
was
a
hero
of
romance
he
did
pretend
to
be
but
he
a
good
fellow
and
though
bruce
absurdities
irritated
him
a
great
deal
he
had
a
feeling
of
delicacy
towards
him
and
a
scrupulousness
that
is
not
to
be
found
every
day
at
other
moments
aylmer
swore
to
himself
cursing
his
impulsiveness
fearing
she
now
would
really
not
ever
think
of
him
as
he
wished
but
as
a
hustling
sort
of
brute
but
no
he
did
care
he
had
come
at
last
to
close
quarters
with
her
he
had
kissed
the
pretty
little
mouth
that
he
had
so
often
watched
with
longing
he
admitted
to
himself
that
he
had
really
wished
to
pose
a
little
in
her
eyes
to
be
the
noble
hero
in
the
third
act
who
goes
away
from
temptation
but
who
does
not
wish
for
the
before
one
idol
this
meeting
at
the
play
tonight
was
the
sort
of
that
is
almost
invariable
in
a
london
romance
how
he
looked
forward
to
it
for
after
vincy
came
in
only
a
few
banalities
had
been
said
he
was
to
see
her
now
for
the
last
time
the
first
time
since
he
had
given
himself
away
to
her
probably
it
was
only
her
usual
kindness
to
others
that
prevented
her
getting
out
of
the
evening
plans
he
thought
or
did
she
want
to
see
him
once
more
at
dinner
before
the
play
edith
was
very
bright
and
particularly
pretty
bruce
too
was
in
good
spirits
rather
sickening
he
remarked
going
away
like
this
we
shall
miss
him
horribly
we
and
then
where
the
sense
edith
in
a
chap
leaving
london
where
he
been
the
whole
of
the
awful
winter
just
as
it
begins
to
be
pleasant
here
pass
the
salt
spill
it
that
unlucky
not
that
i
believe
in
any
superstitious
rot
i
can
see
the
charm
of
the
quaint
old
ideas
about
black
cats
and
so
forth
but
i
do
for
one
moment
attach
any
importance
to
them
nor
to
the
number
thirteen
nor
any
of
that
sort
of
bosh
indeed
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
walked
round
a
ladder
only
today
rather
than
go
under
it
but
that
simply
because
i
do
go
in
for
trying
to
be
especially
original
dear
i
think
you
quite
right
oddly
enough
as
i
was
trying
to
tell
you
just
now
only
you
did
seem
to
be
listening
a
black
cat
ran
across
my
path
only
this
afternoon
he
smiled
gratified
at
the
recollection
do
you
mean
your
path
i
did
know
you
had
one
or
that
there
were
any
paths
about
here
literal
women
are
i
mean
nearly
ran
over
it
in
a
taxi
when
i
say
i
nearly
ran
over
it
i
mean
that
a
black
cat
on
the
same
side
of
the
taxi
if
you
must
have
details
ran
away
as
the
taxi
drove
on
yes
aylmer
is
a
thoroughly
good
chap
and
he
and
i
have
enormous
sympathy
i
do
know
any
man
in
the
world
with
whom
i
have
more
intellectual
sympathy
than
aylmer
ross
do
you
remember
how
i
pointed
him
out
to
you
at
once
at
the
mitchells
and
sometimes
when
i
think
how
you
used
to
sneer
at
the
mitchells
oh
you
did
you
know
dear
before
you
knew
them
and
i
remember
all
the
trouble
i
had
to
get
you
to
go
there
i
wonder
i
simply
wonder
do
you
see
through
going
there
as
i
advised
we
made
one
of
the
nicest
friends
we
ever
had
bruce
you
did
have
trouble
to
get
me
to
go
to
the
mitchells
you
forgetting
the
trouble
was
i
could
go
there
very
well
until
i
was
asked
the
very
first
time
we
were
asked
if
you
recollect
we
flew
why
we
went
on
the
wrong
night
that
does
look
as
if
i
was
very
keen
about
it
however
i
not
blaming
you
dear
it
was
your
fault
mind
you
continued
bruce
consider
the
society
theatre
pure
frivolity
but
one
thing
i
say
a
bad
show
there
is
better
than
a
good
show
anywhere
else
there
always
jolly
music
pretty
dresses
pretty
girls
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
dear
do
you
indeed
i
think
so
myself
course
the
first
row
of
the
chorus
is
not
what
it
was
when
i
was
a
bachelor
continued
bruce
frowning
thoughtfully
they
not
so
or
i
do
admire
them
so
much
or
they
do
admire
as
much
or
they
a
different
class
or
or
something
he
laughed
pleased
to
be
facetious
remarked
edith
dear
girl
you
know
perfectly
well
i
think
there
else
in
the
world
like
you
wherever
i
go
i
always
say
there
to
touch
my
wife
edith
got
up
sweet
of
you
continued
bruce
i
think
you
pretty
it
does
follow
that
i
think
everybody
else
is
hideous
i
tell
you
that
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
i
must
say
this
for
you
dear
i
never
seen
any
sign
of
jealousy
on
your
part
show
it
soon
enough
if
i
felt
it
if
i
thought
i
any
cause
said
edith
i
did
think
i
had
bruce
gave
a
rather
fatuous
smile
go
and
get
ready
my
dear
he
answered
let
talk
nonsense
who
going
to
be
there
tonight
do
you
know
only
lady
everard
and
vincy
everard
is
a
nice
woman
you
going
to
that
musical
thing
of
hers
i
suppose
i
suppose
so
in
the
afternoon
and
it
not
very
easy
for
me
to
get
away
in
the
afternoon
but
to
please
you
i
take
you
see
i
loathe
music
except
musical
comedies
and
i
think
if
ever
there
was
a
set
of
appalling
rotters
i
feel
inclined
to
knock
them
off
the
the
way
they
go
on
at
lady
everard
at
the
same
time
some
of
them
are
very
cultured
and
intelligent
chaps
and
a
very
charming
woman
one
ca
get
in
a
word
edgeways
but
one
does
well
she
listens
and
laughs
at
one
jokes
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
think
rather
glad
you
not
musical
edith
it
takes
a
woman
away
from
her
husband
musical
oh
dear
i
thought
i
was
said
edith
anyhow
not
when
i
here
so
it
does
matter
besides
your
being
appreciative
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
very
nice
look
what
a
social
success
you
had
at
the
everards
for
instance
through
listening
and
understanding
these
things
it
is
not
an
accomplishment
to
throw
away
no
edith
dear
i
should
tell
you
if
you
would
only
listen
to
me
to
keep
up
your
music
but
you
wo
and
there
an
end
of
it
that
soufflé
was
really
very
good
cook
improving
for
a
plain
little
cook
like
that
with
such
small
wages
and
no
kitchenmaid
she
does
quite
well
yes
she
not
bad
said
edith
she
knew
that
if
bruce
had
been
aware
the
cook
remuneration
was
adequate
he
would
not
have
enjoyed
his
dinner
they
were
in
the
box
in
the
pretty
theatre
lady
everard
very
smart
in
black
sparkling
with
diamonds
was
already
there
with
aylmer
vincy
had
not
arrived
the
house
was
crammed
to
the
ceiling
gay
electrical
music
of
exhilarating
futility
was
being
played
by
the
orchestra
the
scene
consisted
of
model
cottages
a
chorus
of
pretty
girls
in
striped
cotton
were
singing
the
heroine
came
on
she
was
well
known
for
her
smile
which
had
become
public
property
on
picture
and
the
obosh
bottles
she
was
dressed
as
a
also
but
in
striped
silk
with
a
real
lace
apron
and
a
few
diamonds
then
the
hero
arrived
he
wore
a
red
shirt
brown
boots
and
had
a
tenor
voice
he
explained
an
interesting
little
bit
of
the
plot
which
included
an
eccentric
will
and
other
novelties
the
humorous
dandy
of
the
play
was
greeted
with
shouts
of
joy
by
the
chorus
and
equal
enthusiasm
by
the
audience
he
agreed
to
change
places
with
the
hero
who
wished
to
give
up
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
a
year
to
marry
the
heroine
disinterested
murmured
lady
everard
nice
of
him
sure
it
is
many
people
that
would
do
a
thing
like
that
a
nice
voice
too
of
course
this
is
not
what
call
good
music
but
very
bright
in
its
way
and
the
words
i
always
think
these
words
are
so
clever
so
witty
listen
to
them
do
listen
to
them
dear
mrs
ottley
they
listened
to
the
beautiful
words
sung
of
which
the
refrain
ran
as
follows
author
told
the
actor
the
actor
had
a
fit
the
box
office
man
told
the
the
theatre
all
was
in
quite
a
whirl
the
told
the
chorus
whatever
could
it
be
the
super
asked
the
manager
what
did
the
censor
see
murmured
lady
everard
i
know
his
father
so
well
father
the
censor
the
father
of
the
composer
a
very
charming
man
when
he
was
young
he
used
to
come
to
my
parties
my
wednesdays
i
used
to
have
wednesdays
then
i
do
have
wednesdays
now
i
think
it
better
to
telephone
at
the
last
minute
any
particular
day
for
my
afternoons
because
after
all
you
never
know
when
the
artists
one
wants
are
disengaged
does
one
you
coming
on
wednesday
to
hear
paul
la
france
sing
dear
mrs
ottley
edith
smiled
and
nodded
assent
trying
to
stop
the
incessant
trickle
of
lady
everard
leaking
conversation
she
loved
theatres
and
she
enjoyed
hearing
every
word
which
was
impossible
while
there
was
more
dialogue
in
the
box
than
on
the
stage
also
aylmer
was
sitting
behind
her
the
comic
lady
now
came
on
there
were
shrieks
of
laughter
at
her
unnecessary
and
irrelevant
green
boots
and
crinoline
and
cockney
accent
she
proposed
to
marry
the
hero
who
ran
away
from
her
there
was
more
chorus
and
the
curtain
fell
in
the
interval
vincy
arrived
he
and
bruce
went
into
the
little
salon
behind
the
box
lady
everard
joined
them
there
edith
and
aylmer
looked
round
the
house
the
audience
at
the
society
theatre
is
a
special
one
as
at
the
plays
in
which
the
favourite
and
perform
there
are
always
far
more
women
than
men
at
this
theatre
there
are
always
far
more
men
than
women
the
stage
box
opposite
our
friends
was
filled
with
a
party
of
about
ten
men
looks
like
a
jury
said
edith
it
is
a
board
of
directors
said
aylmer
the
first
two
rows
of
the
stalls
were
principally
occupied
by
and
rather
elderly
gentlemen
many
had
grey
moustaches
and
a
military
bearing
others
were
inclined
to
be
stout
with
brilliant
exuberant
manners
and
very
dark
hair
that
simply
would
lie
flat
there
were
a
great
many
parties
made
up
like
those
of
our
friends
of
somebody
in
love
with
somebody
surrounded
by
chaperons
these
were
the
social
people
and
also
there
were
a
certain
number
of
young
men
with
pretty
women
who
were
too
fashionably
dressed
too
much
made
up
and
who
were
looking
forward
too
much
to
supper
these
ladies
seemed
inclined
to
crab
the
play
and
to
find
unimportant
little
faults
with
the
unimportant
actresses
there
were
many
americans
who
took
it
seriously
and
altogether
one
could
see
it
was
an
immense
success
in
other
words
everyone
had
paid
for
their
seats
the
play
was
over
aylmer
had
not
had
a
word
with
edith
he
was
going
away
the
next
day
and
he
asked
them
all
to
supper
of
course
he
drove
edith
and
lady
everard
took
the
other
two
in
her
motor
an
angel
if
you
forgiven
me
he
said
as
they
went
out
chapter
xiii
the
you
forgiven
me
he
asked
anxiously
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
dark
shelter
of
the
cab
oh
yes
please
do
let
talk
about
it
any
more
what
time
do
you
start
tomorrow
think
i
ought
to
go
then
say
so
you
rather
i
remained
here
rather
we
should
go
on
as
we
are
would
you
you
know
i
should
never
have
dreamt
of
suggesting
you
should
go
away
i
like
you
to
be
here
any
cost
to
me
no
edith
i
ca
stand
it
and
since
i
told
you
it
harder
your
knowing
makes
it
harder
should
have
thought
that
if
you
liked
anyone
so
much
you
would
want
to
see
them
all
the
time
as
much
as
possible
always
even
with
other
people
anything
rather
than
not
see
them
be
away
altogether
at
least
that
how
i
should
feel
doubt
you
would
that
a
woman
view
and
besides
you
see
you
do
care
more
i
cared
the
less
i
should
go
away
i
think
have
i
tried
and
i
ca
bear
it
you
do
know
how
cruel
you
are
with
your
sweetness
edith
oh
put
yourself
in
my
place
how
do
you
suppose
i
feel
when
i
been
with
you
like
this
near
you
looking
at
you
delighting
in
you
the
whole
evening
and
then
after
supper
you
go
away
with
bruce
had
a
very
pleasant
evening
no
doubt
it
all
right
for
you
to
feel
you
got
me
as
you
know
you
have
and
with
no
fear
no
danger
yes
you
enjoy
it
aylmer
he
saw
in
the
that
her
eyes
looked
reproachful
did
mean
it
i
sorry
i
always
being
sorry
his
bitter
tone
changed
to
gentleness
want
to
speak
to
you
now
edith
we
much
time
do
take
away
your
hand
a
minute
always
told
you
did
i
that
the
atmosphere
round
you
is
so
clear
that
i
feel
with
you
i
in
the
palace
of
truth
you
so
you
the
only
woman
i
ever
met
who
really
cared
for
truth
you
not
afraid
of
it
and
you
as
straight
and
honourable
as
a
man
i
do
mean
you
diplomatise
if
you
choose
of
course
and
better
than
anyone
but
it
is
your
nature
to
deceive
yourself
nor
anyone
else
i
recognise
that
in
you
i
love
it
and
that
why
i
ca
pretend
or
act
with
you
i
must
be
frank
do
be
frank
love
you
i
madly
in
love
with
you
i
adore
you
aylmer
stopped
deeply
moved
at
the
sound
of
his
own
words
few
people
realise
the
effect
such
words
have
on
the
speaker
saying
them
to
her
was
a
great
joy
and
an
indulgence
but
it
increased
painfully
his
passionate
feeling
making
it
more
accentuated
and
acute
to
let
himself
go
verbally
was
a
wild
bitter
pleasure
it
hurt
him
and
he
enjoyed
it
i
do
anything
in
the
world
to
get
you
and
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
too
and
if
you
cared
for
me
i
go
away
all
the
same
at
least
i
believe
i
should
we
shall
be
there
in
a
minute
dear
i
want
you
occasionally
to
write
to
me
there
no
earthly
reason
why
you
should
i
let
you
know
my
address
it
will
prevent
my
being
too
miserable
or
rushing
back
and
will
you
do
something
else
for
me
well
when
you
write
call
me
aylmer
you
never
have
yet
in
a
letter
treat
me
just
like
a
friend
as
you
treat
vincy
tell
me
what
you
doing
where
you
going
who
you
see
about
archie
and
dilly
about
your
new
dresses
and
hats
what
you
reading
any
little
thing
so
that
i
still
in
touch
with
you
i
will
i
shall
like
to
and
do
be
depressed
aylmer
do
enjoy
your
journey
write
to
me
too
i
going
to
write
to
you
but
only
in
an
official
way
only
for
bruce
and
listen
take
care
of
yourself
you
too
unselfish
do
what
you
want
sometimes
not
what
other
people
want
all
the
time
read
too
much
by
electric
light
and
try
your
eyes
and
do
go
out
in
these
thin
shoes
in
damp
weather
promise
she
laughed
a
little
touched
a
great
deal
with
the
children
i
like
to
think
of
you
with
them
and
i
hope
you
wo
be
always
going
out
he
continued
in
a
tone
of
unconscious
command
which
she
enjoyed
do
be
continually
at
lady
everard
or
at
the
mitchells
or
anywhere
i
hate
you
to
be
admired
how
i
hate
it
and
i
was
always
brought
up
to
believe
people
are
proud
of
what
called
the
of
the
people
that
they
like
you
believe
it
edith
that
all
bosh
vanity
and
nonsense
at
any
rate
i
know
i
not
in
fact
as
i
ca
have
you
myself
i
would
really
like
you
to
be
shut
up
very
happy
very
well
with
everything
in
the
world
you
like
even
thinking
of
me
a
little
but
absolutely
shut
up
and
if
you
did
go
out
for
a
breath
of
air
i
should
like
to
see
you
i
like
you
to
cover
up
your
head
wear
a
thick
veil
and
a
thick
loose
dress
very
oriental
she
laughed
not
a
bit
oriental
i
human
it
selfish
i
suppose
you
think
well
let
me
tell
you
if
you
care
to
know
that
it
and
nothing
else
edith
is
there
anything
in
the
world
i
can
do
for
you
while
i
away
it
would
be
kind
to
ask
me
remember
i
sha
see
you
for
three
months
i
may
come
back
in
september
ca
i
send
you
something
do
something
that
you
like
i
count
on
you
to
ask
me
at
any
time
if
there
anything
in
the
world
i
could
do
for
you
no
matter
what
no
woman
could
help
being
really
pleased
at
such
devotion
and
such
views
especially
when
they
were
not
going
to
be
carried
out
edith
was
thrilled
by
the
passionate
emotion
she
felt
near
her
how
cold
it
would
be
when
he
had
gone
he
nice
handsome
clever
a
darling
forget
me
aylmer
i
do
want
you
to
forget
me
later
on
have
a
real
friendship
do
use
that
word
it
so
false
such
humbug
for
at
any
rate
to
say
i
could
care
for
you
as
a
friend
is
simply
blasphemy
how
can
it
be
possible
for
but
i
try
thanks
for
you
an
angel
i
try
it
horribly
inconsistent
and
no
doubt
very
wicked
of
me
but
do
you
know
i
should
be
rather
pained
if
i
heard
you
had
fallen
in
love
with
someone
else
that
would
be
impossible
he
cried
never
it
the
real
thing
there
never
was
anyone
like
you
there
never
will
be
let
me
look
at
you
once
more
edith
and
now
here
we
are
edith
took
away
her
hand
scarf
coming
off
you
catch
cold
said
aylmer
and
as
he
was
trying
rather
awkwardly
to
put
the
piece
of
blue
chiffon
round
her
head
he
drew
the
dear
head
to
him
and
kissed
her
harshly
she
could
not
protest
it
was
too
final
besides
they
were
arriving
the
cab
stopped
vincy
came
to
the
door
to
normanhurst
cried
vincy
with
unnecessary
facetiousness
giving
them
a
slightly
anxious
glance
he
thought
edith
had
more
colour
than
usual
aylmer
was
pale
the
supper
was
an
absolute
and
complete
failure
the
guests
displayed
the
forced
gaiety
and
real
depression
and
constrained
absentmindedness
of
genuine
and
hopeless
boredom
except
for
lady
everard
ceaseless
flow
of
empty
prattle
the
pauses
would
have
been
too
obvious
edith
for
whom
it
was
a
dreary
was
rather
silent
aylmer
talked
more
and
a
little
more
loudly
than
usual
and
looked
worn
bruce
whom
champagne
quickly
saddened
became
vaguely
reminiscent
and
communicative
about
old
dead
forgotten
grievances
of
the
past
while
vincy
who
was
a
little
shocked
at
what
he
saw
and
he
always
saw
everything
did
his
very
best
just
saving
the
entertainment
from
being
a
too
disastrous
frost
good
luck
said
aylmer
lifting
his
glass
with
sham
conviviality
i
start
tomorrow
morning
by
the
orient
express
whispered
vincy
primly
it
sound
romantic
and
exciting
edith
said
two
words
together
are
so
delightfully
adventurous
orient
the
languid
east
and
yet
express
quickness
speed
it
a
fascinating
blend
of
ideas
it
adventurous
or
not
is
the
question
my
dear
girl
i
only
wish
we
were
going
too
said
bruce
with
a
sigh
i
never
can
get
away
from
my
wretched
work
to
have
any
fun
like
you
lucky
chaps
with
no
responsibilities
or
troubles
i
suppose
perhaps
we
may
take
the
children
to
westgate
for
whitsuntide
and
that
about
all
not
that
there
is
quite
a
good
hotel
there
and
of
course
it
all
right
for
me
because
i
shall
play
golf
all
day
and
run
up
to
town
when
i
want
to
still
it
very
different
from
one
of
these
jolly
long
journeys
that
you
gay
bachelors
can
indulge
in
i
not
a
gay
bachelor
my
boy
is
coming
to
join
me
in
the
summer
holidays
wherever
i
am
said
aylmer
but
that
not
the
point
i
should
like
to
go
with
you
now
at
once
do
you
wish
we
were
both
going
edith
why
are
we
going
with
him
tomorrow
june
just
the
nice
time
in
london
bruce
said
vincy
in
his
demure
voice
it
be
terribly
hot
said
lady
everard
vaguely
she
always
thought
every
place
must
be
terribly
hot
are
you
going
to
venice
delightful
the
viennese
are
so
charming
and
the
austrian
officers
oh
you
going
to
sicily
first
far
too
hot
paul
la
france
the
young
singer
you
know
told
me
that
when
he
was
in
sicily
his
voice
completely
altered
the
heat
quite
affected
the
of
his
voice
as
the
french
call
it
and
what
a
voice
it
is
at
its
best
it
not
the
tenor
of
course
but
the
medium
is
so
wonderfully
soft
and
well
developed
i
do
say
for
a
moment
that
he
will
ever
be
a
caruso
but
as
far
as
he
goes
and
he
goes
pretty
far
mind
it
really
wonderful
you
coming
on
wednesday
are
you
dear
mrs
ottley
ah
she
stopped
and
held
up
her
small
beaded
fan
that
the
band
playing
i
know
it
so
well
everyone
knows
it
it
either
or
or
no
is
it
really
what
is
it
all
the
old
italian
operas
are
coming
in
again
by
the
way
you
know
my
dear
the
that
sort
of
thing
there
nothing
like
it
for
showing
off
the
voice
wagner
practically
gone
out
at
least
what
call
out
and
i
always
said
debussy
would
last
paul
la
france
still
clings
to
brahms
brahms
suits
his
voice
better
than
anyone
else
he
always
falls
back
on
brahms
and
dear
de
lara
and
tosti
of
course
tosti
i
remember
aylmer
and
his
guests
had
reached
the
stage
of
being
apparently
all
lost
in
their
own
thoughts
and
the
conversation
had
been
practically
reduced
to
a
disjointed
monologue
on
music
by
lady
everard
when
the
lights
began
to
be
lowered
and
the
party
broke
up
coming
to
see
you
so
soon
said
vincy
chapter
xiv
the
letter
it
was
about
a
fortnight
later
edith
and
bruce
from
different
directions
arrived
at
the
same
moment
at
their
door
and
went
up
together
in
the
lift
on
the
little
was
a
letter
addressed
to
edith
she
took
it
up
rather
quickly
and
went
into
the
bruce
followed
her
a
letter
edith
do
you
suppose
it
is
bruce
i
have
supposed
it
was
edith
a
plum
pudding
he
laughed
very
much
are
very
humorous
today
bruce
she
sat
down
with
her
hat
veil
and
gloves
on
holding
the
letter
she
did
not
go
to
her
room
because
that
would
leave
her
no
further
retreat
bruce
sat
down
exactly
opposite
to
her
with
his
coat
and
gloves
on
he
slowly
drew
off
one
glove
folded
it
carefully
and
put
it
down
then
he
said
amiably
a
little
huskily
from
a
friend
beg
your
pardon
what
did
you
say
dear
he
raised
his
voice
unnecessarily
said
a
letter
from
a
friend
she
started
yes
i
heard
this
time
i
know
of
an
excellent
aurist
in
bond
street
i
wish
you
go
and
see
him
i
give
you
the
address
know
of
a
very
good
elocutionist
in
oxford
street
i
think
i
would
go
and
have
some
lessons
if
i
were
you
bruce
the
summer
classes
are
just
beginning
they
teach
you
to
speak
so
clearly
to
get
your
voice
over
the
footlights
as
it
were
i
think
all
men
require
to
study
oratory
and
elocution
it
comes
in
so
useful
bruce
lowered
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
you
playing
the
fool
with
me
she
nodded
amiably
in
the
manner
of
a
person
perfectly
deaf
but
who
is
pretending
to
hear
dear
yes
quite
right
do
you
mean
by
right
he
unfastened
his
coat
and
threw
it
open
glaring
at
her
a
little
me
do
know
is
that
letter
from
edith
he
said
breezily
in
a
tone
of
sudden
careless
and
cheery
interest
have
read
it
yet
bruce
she
answered
in
the
same
tone
brightly
why
do
you
read
it
i
shall
presently
i
opened
it
he
took
off
his
other
glove
folded
it
with
the
first
one
made
them
into
a
ball
and
threw
it
across
the
room
against
the
window
while
his
colour
deepened
do
you
want
to
have
a
game
shall
i
send
for
archie
why
do
you
take
off
your
hat
ca
think
why
do
you
take
off
your
coat
have
time
show
me
that
letter
letter
prevaricate
with
me
bruce
had
now
definitely
lost
his
temper
can
stand
anything
except
prevarication
anything
in
the
world
but
prevarication
i
can
endure
with
patience
but
that
as
if
you
did
know
perfectly
well
there
only
one
letter
i
want
to
see
your
letter
from
should
i
know
edith
got
up
and
went
towards
the
door
bruce
was
beforehand
with
her
and
barred
the
way
standing
with
his
arms
outstretched
and
his
back
to
the
door
i
pained
and
surprised
at
your
conduct
she
exclaimed
echo
my
words
i
will
be
echoed
do
you
hear
behaviour
then
if
you
prefer
the
word
why
do
you
wish
me
to
see
that
letter
edith
quickly
looked
at
the
letter
until
this
moment
she
had
had
an
unreasonable
and
nervous
terror
that
aylmer
might
have
forgotten
his
intention
of
writing
what
he
called
officially
and
might
have
written
her
what
she
now
inwardly
termed
a
lot
of
nonsense
but
she
now
saw
she
had
made
a
mistake
it
was
not
his
handwriting
nor
his
postmark
she
became
firmer
here
bruce
she
said
in
a
decided
voice
quietly
have
been
married
eight
years
and
i
consider
you
ought
to
trust
me
sufficiently
to
allow
me
to
open
my
own
letters
you
do
do
you
what
next
what
next
i
suppose
the
next
thing
you
wish
is
to
be
a
suffragette
question
said
edith
in
the
most
cool
high
irritating
voice
she
could
command
of
votes
for
women
hardly
enters
into
our
argument
here
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
take
no
interest
in
any
kind
of
politics
and
i
may
be
entirely
wrong
but
if
i
were
compelled
to
take
sides
on
the
subject
i
should
be
an
you
would
would
you
that
as
well
to
know
that
interesting
give
me
that
letter
you
think
you
have
the
right
to
speak
to
me
like
that
he
said
rather
pathetically
trying
to
control
himself
beg
you
i
you
to
let
me
see
the
letter
hang
it
all
you
know
perfectly
well
old
girl
how
fond
i
am
of
you
i
may
worry
you
a
bit
sometimes
but
you
know
my
heart
all
right
course
bruce
i
not
finding
fault
with
you
i
only
want
to
read
my
own
letter
that
all
if
i
let
you
out
of
this
room
without
having
shown
it
me
then
if
there
something
you
do
want
me
to
see
you
tear
it
up
or
chuck
it
in
the
fire
edith
was
quite
impressed
at
this
flash
of
prophetic
insight
she
admitted
to
herself
he
was
right
entirely
a
matter
of
principle
she
said
after
another
reassuring
look
at
the
envelope
only
a
matter
of
principle
dear
i
years
old
we
been
married
eight
years
you
leave
the
housekeeping
the
whole
ordering
of
the
children
education
and
heaps
of
other
quite
important
things
entirely
to
me
in
fact
you
lead
almost
the
life
of
a
schoolboy
without
any
of
the
tiresome
part
and
with
freedom
going
to
school
in
the
day
and
amusing
yourself
in
the
evening
while
everything
disagreeable
and
important
is
thought
of
and
seen
to
for
you
you
only
have
the
children
with
you
when
they
amuse
you
i
have
all
the
responsibility
i
have
to
be
patient
thoughtful
in
fact
you
leave
things
to
me
more
than
most
men
do
to
their
wives
bruce
you
wo
be
bothered
even
to
look
at
an
account
to
do
a
thing
but
i
not
complaining
you
not
it
sounded
a
little
like
it
it
is
i
do
all
this
responsibility
but
i
ought
at
least
to
be
allowed
to
read
my
letters
darling
you
shall
as
a
rule
look
here
old
girl
you
shall
i
promise
you
faithfully
dear
oh
edith
you
looking
awfully
pretty
i
like
that
hat
look
here
i
promise
you
dear
i
ask
you
again
never
as
long
as
i
live
but
i
a
fancy
to
read
this
particular
letter
why
not
just
gratify
it
it
a
very
harmless
whim
his
tone
suddenly
changed
do
you
suppose
there
the
damned
letter
something
you
jolly
well
anxious
i
should
see
she
made
a
step
forward
he
rushed
at
her
snatched
the
letter
out
of
her
hand
and
went
to
the
window
with
it
she
went
into
her
own
room
shut
the
door
and
threw
herself
on
the
bed
her
whole
frame
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
bruce
alone
with
trembling
fingers
tore
open
the
envelope
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
opposed
by
edith
before
in
this
way
he
read
these
words
in
stereotyped
writing
will
call
on
receipt
of
the
lavender

bruce
rushed
to
the
door
and
called
out
sorry
edie
i
say
i
sorry
come
back
there
was
no
answer
he
pushed
the
letter
under
the
door
of
her
room
and
said
through
the
keyhole
look
here
i
just
going
for
a
little
walk
i
be
back
to
dinner
do
be
angry
bruce
brought
her
home
a
large
bunch
of
parma
violets
but
neither
of
them
ever
referred
to
the
question
again
and
for
some
time
there
was
a
little
less
of
the
refrain
of
i
master
in
my
own
house
or
am
i
not
the
next
morning
when
a
long
letter
came
from
aylmer
from
spain
edith
read
it
at
breakfast
and
bruce
did
ask
a
single
question
however
she
left
it
on
his
plate
as
if
by
mistake
he
might
just
as
well
read
it
chapter
xv
mavis
argles
vincy
had
the
reputation
of
spending
his
fortune
with
elaborate
yet
careful
lavishness
buying
nothing
that
he
did
not
enjoy
and
giving
away
everything
he
did
not
want
at
the
same
time
his
friends
occasionally
wondered
on
what
he
spend
both
his
time
and
his
money
he
was
immensely
popular
quite
sought
after
socially
but
he
declined
half
his
invitations
and
lived
a
rather
quiet
existence
in
the
small
flat
with
its
oriental
decorations
and
violent
and
fierce
chinese
weapons
high
up
in
victoria
street
vincy
really
concealed
under
an
amiable
and
gentle
exterior
the
kindest
heart
of
any
man
in
london
there
was
in
him
than
met
the
eye
as
people
say
and
frank
and
confidential
as
he
was
to
his
really
intimate
friends
at
least
one
side
of
his
life
was
lived
in
shadow
it
was
his
secret
romance
with
a
certain
young
girl
artist
whom
he
saw
rarely
for
sufficient
reasons
he
was
not
devoted
to
her
in
the
way
that
he
was
to
edith
for
whom
he
had
the
wholehearted
enthusiasm
of
a
loyal
friend
and
the
idolising
worship
of
a
fanatic
admirer
it
was
perhaps
nature
a
little
to
sacrifice
himself
for
anyone
he
was
fond
of
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
thinking
out
means
of
helping
materially
the
young
and
always
he
succeeded
in
this
object
by
his
elaborate
and
tactful
care
for
he
knew
she
was
very
very
poor
and
that
her
pride
was
of
an
order
she
never
said
she
was
hard
up
as
every
modern
person
does
whether
rich
or
poor
but
he
knew
that
she
really
lacked
what
he
considered
very
nearly
if
not
quite
the
necessities
of
life
vincy
feeling
for
her
was
a
curious
one
he
had
known
her
since
she
was
sixteen
she
was
now
yet
he
did
not
trust
her
and
she
troubled
him
he
had
met
her
at
a
studio
at
a
time
when
he
had
thought
of
studying
art
seriously
sometimes
something
about
her
worried
and
wearied
him
yet
he
could
do
without
her
for
long
the
fact
that
he
knew
he
was
of
great
help
to
her
fascinated
him
he
often
thought
that
if
she
had
been
rich
and
he
poor
he
would
never
wish
to
see
her
again
certainly
it
was
the
touch
of
pathos
in
her
life
that
held
him
also
of
course
she
was
pretty
with
a
pale
thin
face
deep
blue
eyes
and
rich
dark
red
frizzy
hair
that
was
always
coming
down
the
untidy
hair
of
the
he
was
very
much
afraid
of
compromising
her
and
was
very
much
afraid
of
the
elderly
aunt
with
whom
she
lived
she
had
no
parents
which
made
her
more
pathetic
but
no
more
free
he
could
not
go
and
see
her
with
any
satisfaction
to
either
of
them
at
home
though
he
did
so
occasionally
this
was
why
she
first
went
to
see
him
at
his
flat
but
these
visits
as
they
were
both
placed
could
of
course
happen
rarely
mavis
argles
this
was
the
girl
extraordinary
name
had
a
curious
fascination
for
him
he
was
rather
fond
of
her
yet
the
greatest
wish
he
had
in
the
world
was
to
break
it
off
when
with
her
he
felt
himself
to
be
at
once
a
criminal
and
a
benefactor
a
sinner
and
a
saint
theoretically
theatrically
and
perhaps
conventionally
his
relations
with
her
constituted
him
the
villain
of
the
piece
yet
he
behaved
to
her
more
like
don
quixote
than
don
juan
one
afternoon
about
four
he
was
expecting
her
vincy
had
arranged
an
elaborate
tea
on
his
little
green
marble
everything
was
there
that
she
liked
she
was
particularly
attached
to
scones
he
also
had
sandwiches
sweets
chocolate
and
strawberries
as
he
heard
the
slightly
creaking
step
his
heart
began
to
beat
loudly
quick
beats
he
changed
colour
smiled
and
nervously
went
to
the
door
you
are
mavis
he
calmed
her
and
himself
by
this
banal
welcome
he
made
a
movement
to
help
her
off
with
her
coat
but
she
stopped
him
and
he
did
insist
guessing
that
she
supposed
her
blouse
to
be
unfit
for
publication
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
leaned
back
looking
at
him
with
her
pretty
weary
dreary
young
blue
eyes
seems
such
a
long
time
since
i
saw
you
said
vincy
tired
i
wish
i
had
a
lift
am
tired
she
spoke
in
rather
a
hoarse
voice
always
i
ought
not
to
stop
long
stay
a
minute
longer
wo
you
he
asked
i
like
that
i
only
just
this
moment
arrived
mavis
do
say
that
have
some
tea
he
waited
on
her
till
she
looked
brighter
is
aunt
jessie
jessie
been
rather
that
nasty
pain
asked
vincy
she
stared
at
him
then
laughed
if
you
remember
anything
about
it
mavis
i
do
remember
it
i
remember
what
was
the
matter
with
her
quite
well
bet
you
do
what
was
it
she
asked
with
childish
eagerness
was
that
wind
round
the
heart
that
she
gets
sometimes
she
told
me
about
it
nothing
seems
to
shift
it
either
mavis
laughed
hoarse
childlike
laughter
that
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
a
shame
to
make
fun
of
aunt
jessie
she
a
very
very
good
sort
good
gracious
mavis
if
it
comes
to
sorts
i
sure
she
quite
at
the
top
of
the
tree
but
do
let
bother
about
her
now
you
want
to
bother
about
you
come
out
and
dine
with
me
mavis
it
would
be
a
change
he
was
going
to
say
you
but
altered
it
me
no
vincy
you
ca
take
me
out
to
dinner
i
do
look
up
to
the
mark
she
looked
in
a
glass
hat
it
a
very
good
hat
it
cost
more
than
you
think
but
it
shows
signs
of
wear
that
reminds
me
began
vincy
you
think
happened
the
other
day
a
cousin
of
mine
who
was
up
in
london
a
little
while
bought
a
hat
it
did
suit
her
and
she
insisted
on
giving
it
to
me
she
did
know
what
to
do
to
get
rid
of
it
i
given
her
something
or
other
for
her
birthday
and
declared
she
would
give
this
to
for
birthday
and
so
i
got
it
on
my
hands
a
very
queer
thing
it
does
sound
true
does
it
do
have
some
more
tea
mavis
darling
thanks
i
have
another
cake
i
smoke
she
laughed
you
do
what
you
like
in
your
own
house
yours
he
answered
you
here
and
when
you
not
even
more
he
added
as
an
afterthought
he
struck
a
match
she
laughed
and
said
do
believe
i
understand
you
a
bit
i
went
to
the
play
last
night
said
vincy
mavis
it
was
such
a
wearing
play
about
nothing
i
suppose
they
always
are
now
no
it
was
all
about
everything
the
people
were
clever
it
was
something
cruel
how
clever
they
were
one
man
lay
down
the
law
oh
did
he
though
i
do
hold
with
being
bullied
and
lectured
from
the
stage
do
you
mavis
it
seems
so
unfair
when
you
ca
answer
back
it
bernard
shaw
she
asked
it
was
not
this
time
it
was
someone
else
oh
i
do
feel
sometimes
when
i
sitting
in
my
stall
so
good
and
quiet
holding
my
programme
nicely
and
sitting
up
straight
to
the
table
as
it
were
and
then
a
fellow
lets
me
have
it
tells
me
where
i
wrong
and
all
that
i
like
to
stand
up
and
give
a
back
answer
would
you
i
like
to
see
do
it
er
what
colour
is
that
hat
that
your
cousin
gave
you
colour
he
said
thoughtfully
smoking
me
see
what
colour
was
it
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
was
any
particular
colour
it
was
a
very
curious
colour
sort
of
or
was
it
cerise
or
violet
you
would
like
to
see
it
would
you
yes
i
like
to
see
it
i
would
try
it
on
of
course
he
opened
the
box
what
a
jolly
hat
she
exclaimed
may
not
know
it
but
that
would
just
suit
me
it
would
go
with
my
dress
too
she
took
off
her
own
hat
and
touched
up
her
hair
with
her
fingers
and
tried
on
the
other
under
it
her
eyes
brightened
in
front
of
the
glass
her
colour
rose
she
changed
as
one
looked
at
her
she
was
sixteen
again
the
child
he
had
first
met
at
the
art
school
you
think
it
suits
me
she
said
turning
round
i
think
you
look
very
charming
in
it
shall
i
put
it
back
there
was
a
pause
know
what
on
earth
to
do
with
it
he
said
discontentedly
so
silly
having
a
hat
about
in
a
place
like
this
of
course
you
would
dare
to
keep
it
i
suppose
it
does
suit
you
all
right
you
know
it
would
be
awfully
kind
of
you
a
funny
person
you
are
vincy
i
like
to
keep
it
what
could
i
tell
aunt
jessie
well
you
see
that
where
it
is
i
suppose
it
would
do
for
you
to
tell
her
the
truth
do
you
mean
by
the
truth
mean
what
i
told
you
how
my
cousin
cissie
cavanack
he
smiled
a
little
as
he
invented
this
name
up
to
town
chose
the
wrong
hat
did
know
what
to
do
with
it
and
you
know
could
tell
her
all
that
of
course
right
said
vincy
putting
the
other
hat
the
old
one
in
the
box
where
shall
we
dine
vincy
i
think
you
very
sweet
to
me
but
how
late

i
get
back
to
ravenscourt
park
not
miss
the
train
then
you
catch
the
quarter
to
ten
and
get
back
at
about
eleven
would
you
i
did
need
you
ask
do
know
vincy
i
have
a
curious
feeling
sometimes
i
believe
you
rather
glad
when
i
gone
relieved
my
dear
he
answered
how
you
worry
all
the
time
if
you
only
have
what
i
call
a
quiet
and
a
chat
without
being
always
on
the
fidget
always
looking
either
at
the
glass
or
at
the
clock
one
might
have
that
feeling
her
colour
rose
and
tears
came
to
her
eyes
then
you
glad
when
i
gone
she
pouted
do
care
for
me
a
bit
vincy
she
said
in
a
plaintive
voice
he
sat
down
next
to
her
on
the
little
striped
sofa
and
took
her
hand
give
over
mavis
do
give
over
i
wish
you
would
carry
on
like
that
you
do
carry
on
mavis

go
on
something
cruel

really
reely
i
mean
now

up
and
be
jolly
give
a
kiss
to
the
pretty
gentleman
and
look
at
all
these
pretty
stripes
on
the
sofa
there
that

as
if
i
were
a
baby

we
quarrelling
about
my
dear
i
only
ask
for
information
we
you
awfully
sweet
you
know
i
love
you
vincy
thought
perhaps
it
was
really
all
right
i
feel
miserable
and
jealous
he
smiled
what
are
you
jealous
of
mavis
everything
everyone
all
the
people
you
meet
that
all
well
you
the
only
person
i
ever
meet
by
appointment
at
any
rate
the
ottleys
his
eye
instinctively
travelled
to
a
photograph
of
edith
all
tulle
and
roses
a
rather
fascinating
portrait
about
asked
mavis
price
mrs
ottley
mavis
what
price
no
price
nothing
about
her
she
just
a
great
friend
of
mine
i
think
i
told
you
that
before
what
a
frightfully
bright
light
there
is
in
the
room
vincy
said
he
got
up
and
drew
the
blind
down
he
came
back
to
her
hair
coming
down
he
remarked
sorry
she
said
at
the
back
it
generally
is
move
let
me
do
it
pretending
to
arrange
it
he
took
all
the
hairpins
out
and
the
cloud
of
dark
red
hair
fell
down
on
her
shoulders
like
your
hair
mavis
seems
too
awful
i
should
have
been
with
you
such
a
long
time
this
afternoon
she
exclaimed
long
sometimes
it
seems
so
dreadful
to
think
i
ca
be
with
you
always
does
it
mavis
dear
will
you
do
up
your
hair
and
come
out
to
dinner
dear
i
think
i
better
not
because
of
aunt
jessie
very
well
all
right
then
you
will
another
time
you
do
want
me
to
stay
i
do
do
stay
next
time
next
tuesday
well
very
well
he
took
a
dark
red
carnation
out
of
one
of
the
vases
and
pinned
it
on
to
her
coat
next
time
i
see
you
she
said
want
to
have
a
long
talk
yes
we
must
must
we
he
took
her
downstairs
put
her
into
a
cab
it
was
six
he
felt
something
false
worrying
unreliable
and
incalculable
in
mavis
she
did
seem
real
he
wished
she
were
fortunate
and
happy
but
he
wished
even
more
that
he
were
never
going
to
see
her
again
and
still
he
walked
a
little
way
then
got
into
a
taxi
and
drove
to
see
edith
when
he
was
in
this
peculiar
condition
of
mind
the
odd
mixture
of
satisfaction
amusement
and
boredom
that
he
felt
now
he
always
went
to
see
edith
throwing
himself
into
the
little
affairs
of
her
life
as
if
he
had
nothing
else
on
his
mind
he
was
a
little
anxious
about
edith
it
seemed
to
him
that
since
aylmer
had
been
away
she
had
altered
a
little
chapter
xvi
more
of
the
mitchells
edith
had
become
an
immense
favourite
with
the
mitchells
they
hardly
ever
had
any
entertainment
without
her
her
success
with
their
friends
delighted
mrs
mitchell
who
was
not
capable
of
commonplace
feminine
jealousy
and
who
regarded
edith
as
a
find
of
her
own
she
often
reproached
winthrop
her
husband
for
having
known
bruce
eight
years
without
discovering
his
charming
wife
one
evening
they
had
a
particularly
gay
party
immediately
after
dinner
mitchell
had
insisted
on
dressing
up
and
was
solemnly
announced
in
his
own
house
as
prince
gonoff
a
russian
noble
he
had
a
mania
for
disguising
himself
he
had
once
travelled
five
hundred
miles
under
the
name
of
prince
gotoffski
in
a
fur
coat
a
foreign
accent
a
false
moustache
and
a
special
saloon
carriage
indeed
only
his
wife
knew
all
the
secrets
of
mitchell
wild
early
career
of
unpractical
jokes
to
some
of
which
he
still
clung
when
he
was
younger
he
had
carried
it
pretty
far
she
encouraged
him
yet
at
the
same
time
she
acted
as
ballast
and
was
always
explaining
his
jokes
sometimes
she
was
in
danger
of
explaining
him
entirely
away
she
loved
to
tell
of
his
earlier
exploits
how
often
when
younger
he
had
collected
money
for
charities
particularly
for
the
deaf
and
dumb
cats
league
in
which
he
took
special
interest
by
painting
halves
of
salmon
and
ships
on
fire
on
the
cold
grey
pavement
armed
with
an
accordion
and
masked
to
the
eyes
he
had
appeared
at
eastbourne
and
also
at
the
henley
regatta
as
a
mysterious
musician
at
the
regatta
he
had
been
warned
off
the
course
to
his
great
pride
and
joy
mrs
mitchell
assured
edith
that
his
race
with
a
few
choice
spirits
was
still
talked
of
at
st
leonard
of
course
are
put
in
the
chairs
and
you
pull
them
along
mr
mitchell
was
beaten
by
a
short
head
but
that
mrs
mitchell
declared
was
really
most
unfair
because
he
was
so
handicapped
his
man
was
much
stouter
than
any
of
the
others
and
the
race
by
rights
should
have
been
run
again
when
he
was
at
oxford
he
had
been
well
known
for
concealing
under
a
slightly
rowdy
exterior
the
highest
spirits
of
any
of
the
undergraduates
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
most
fascinating
of
it
seems
that
he
had
distinguished
himself
there
less
for
writing
greek
verse
though
he
was
good
at
it
than
for
the
wonderful
variety
of
fireworks
that
he
persistently
used
to
let
off
under
the
dean
window
it
was
this
fancy
of
his
that
led
first
to
his
popularity
and
afterwards
to
the
unfortunate
episode
of
his
being
sent
down
soon
after
which
he
had
married
privately
chiefly
in
order
to
send
his
parents
an
announcement
of
his
wedding
in
morning
as
a
surprise
some
people
had
come
in
after
dinner
for
there
was
going
to
be
a
little
as
mrs
mitchell
called
it
speaking
in
an
accent
of
her
own
so
appalling
that
as
vincy
observed
it
made
it
sound
quite
improper
edith
watched
intensely
amused
as
she
saw
that
there
were
really
one
or
two
people
present
who
never
having
seen
mitchell
before
naturally
did
not
recognise
him
now
so
that
the
disguise
was
considered
a
triumph
there
was
something
truly
agreeable
in
the
deference
he
was
showing
to
a
peculiarly
yellow
lady
in
red
adorned
with
ugly
real
lace
and
beautiful
false
hair
she
was
obviously
delighted
with
the
russian
prince
is
a
wonderful
man
said
mrs
mitchell
to
edith
as
she
watched
her
husband
proudly
would
dream
he
was
look
at
that
moustache
look
at
the
wonderful
way
his
coat
does
fit
got
just
that
russian
touch
with
his
clothes
i
do
know
how
done
it
i
sure
how
i
wish
dear
aylmer
ross
was
here
he
appreciate
it
so
much
i
wish
he
were
said
edith
ca
think
what
he
went
away
for
i
suppose
he
heard
the
east
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
the
old
wandering
craving
you
read
of
came
over
him
again
i
suppose
well
let
hope
he
meet
some
charming
girl
and
bring
her
back
as
his
bride
where
is
he
now
do
you
know
mrs
ottley
armenia
i
fancy
said
edith
well
we
do
want
him
to
bring
home
an
armenian
do
we
what
colour
are
they
blue
or
brown
or
what
i
hope
will
tell
lady
hartland
that
is
my
husband
she
expect
to
see
winthrop
tonight
she
never
met
him
you
know
but
he
really
ought
to
be
introduced
to
her
i
think
i
shall
tell
him
to
go
and
undress
when
they
had
a
little
dancing
and
she
been
down
to
supper
lady
hartland
was
the
yellow
lady
in
red
who
thought
she
was
flirting
with
a
fascinating
slav
a
sort
of
celebrity
continued
mrs
mitchell
was
an
american
once
and
she
married
sir
charles
hartland
for
her
money
i
hate
these
interested
marriages
do
you
especially
when
international
sir
charles
is
here
he
such
a
sweet
boy
he
a
friend
of
mr
cricker
it
through
mr
cricker
i
know
them
really
lady
everard
has
taken
a
fancy
to
young
cricker
she
wo
leave
him
alone
after
all
he
friend
and
as
he
not
musical
i
do
see
that
she
has
any
special
right
to
him
but
he
there
every
wednesday
now
and
does
his
dances
on
their
sunday
evenings
too
he
got
a
new
one
lovely
quite
lovely
an
imitation
of
lydia
kyasht
as
a
i
wanted
him
to
do
it
here
tonight
but
lady
everard
has
taken
him
to
the
opera
now
wo
you
dance
your
husband
promised
he
would
you
both
look
so
young
edith
refused
to
dance
she
sat
in
a
corner
with
vincy
and
watched
the
dancers
by
special
permission
as
it
was
so
the
turkey
trot
was
allowed
bruce
wanted
to
attempt
it
with
myra
mooney
but
she
was
horrified
and
insisted
on
dancing
the
to
a
jerky
american
said
vincy
think
you
quieter
than
you
used
to
be
sometimes
you
seem
rather
i
i
sorry
there
nothing
so
tedious
to
other
people
why
do
you
think
i
more
serious
think
you
miss
aylmer
i
do
he
gave
a
sort
of
meaning
to
everything
he
always
interesting
and
there
something
about
him
i
do
know
what
it
is
oh
do
be
frightened
vincy
i
not
going
to
use
the
word
personality
is
that
one
of
the
words
that
ought
to
be
forbidden
altogether
in
all
novels
and
newspapers
that
poor
tired
word
is
always
cropping
up
that
and
magnetism
and
temperament
and
technique
let
cut
out
technique
altogether
do
let
there
be
any
that
the
best
way
then
can
say
anything
about
it
i
fed
up
with
it
are
you
i
do
agree
with
you
at
all
i
think
there
ought
to
be
any
amount
of
technique
and
personality
and
magnetism
and
temperament
i
do
mind
much
technique
there
is
as
long
as
nobody
talks
about
it
but
neither
of
these
expressions
is
quite
so
bad
as
that
dreadful
thing
you
always
find
in
american
books
and
that
lots
of
people
have
caught
up
especially
palmists
and
manicures
mentality
mentality
very
depressing
said
vincy
could
get
along
nicely
without
it
i
think
i
had
a
long
letter
from
aylmer
today
he
seemed
unhappy
had
a
few
lines
yesterday
said
edith
said
he
was
having
a
very
good
time
what
did
he
say
to
you
he
wrote
frankly
to
is
he
enamoured
of
sorrow
got
the
hump
frightfully
off
colour
wants
to
come
back
to
london
he
misses
the
mitchells
i
suppose
the
mitchells
edith
smiled
and
looked
pleased
asked
me
not
to
come
here
much
but
he
would
want
you
to
go
anywhere
that
is
so
like
aylmer
he
not
jealous
of
course
how
could
he
be
it
only
a
little
exclusiveness
and
how
delightfully
rare
that
is
edith
dear
i
admire
him
for
it
most
people
now
seem
to
treasure
anything
they
value
in
proportion
to
the
extent
that
it
followed
about
and
surrounded
by
the
vulgar
public
i
sympathise
with
that
feeling
of
wishing
to
keep
anything
of
that
sort
to
oneself
are
more
secretive
than
jealous
yourself
but
i
have
very
much
the
same
feeling
edith
said
women
i
know
think
the
ideal
of
happiness
is
to
be
in
love
with
a
great
man
or
to
be
the
wife
of
a
great
public
success
to
share
his
triumph
they
forget
you
share
the
man
as
well
suppose
the
idea
is
that
after
the
publicity
and
the
acclamation
and
the
fame
and
the
public
glory
and
the
shouting
you
take
the
person
home
and
feel
he
is
only
yours
really
can
a
famous
person
be
only
yours
no
i
should
like
it
it
is
that
i
do
cleverness
and
brilliance
but
i
care
for
the
public
glory
see
you
do
mind
how
great
a
genius
he
is
as
long
as
he
appreciated
replied
vincy
then
in
heaven
name
let
us
stick
to
our
obscurities
chapter
xvii
the
agonies
of
aylmer
in
the
fresh
cheerfulness
of
the
early
morning
after
sleep
with
the
hot
june
sun
shining
in
at
the
window
aylmer
used
to
think
he
was
better
he
would
read
his
letters
and
papers
dress
slowly
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
crowds
on
the
pavement
he
had
come
back
to
paris
feel
the
infectious
cheeriness
and
sense
of
adventure
of
the
city
then
he
would
say
to
himself
that
his
trip
had
been
successful
he
better
when
he
went
out
his
heart
began
to
sink
a
little
already
but
he
fought
it
off
there
would
be
a
glimpse
of
an
english
face
flashing
past
in
a
carriage
he
thought
of
edith
but
he
put
it
aside
then
came
lunch
for
some
reason
immediately
after
lunch
his
malady
for
of
course
such
love
is
a
malady
incongruously
attacked
him
in
an
acute
form
after
lunch
he
asked
himself
could
it
be
that
only
when
he
was
absolutely
rested
before
he
had
had
any
sort
of
fatigue
that
the
deceptive
improvement
would
show
itself
he
felt
a
wondering
humiliation
at
his
own
narrow
grief
however
this
was
the
hour
that
it
recurred
he
did
know
why
he
had
tried
all
sorts
of
physical
cures
for
there
is
no
disguising
the
fact
that
such
suffering
is
physical
and
so
why
should
the
cure
not
be
also
he
had
tried
wine
no
wine
exercise
distraction
everything
and
especially
a
constant
change
of
scene
this
last
was
the
worst
of
all
he
felt
so
exiled
in
sicily
and
in
spain
so
terribly
far
away
it
was
unbearable
he
was
happier
directly
he
got
to
paris
because
he
seemed
more
in
touch
with
england
and
her
yes
the
pain
had
begun
again
aylmer
went
and
sat
alone
outside
the
café
it
was
not
his
nature
to
dwell
on
his
own
sensations
he
would
diagnose
them
quickly
and
acutely
and
then
throw
them
aside
he
was
quickly
bored
with
himself
he
was
no
egotist
but
today
he
thought
he
analyse
his
state
to
see
what
could
be
done
six
weeks
he
had
not
seen
her
for
six
weeks
the
longing
was
no
better
the
pain
seemed
to
begin
at
his
throat
pressing
down
gradually
on
the
chest
it
was
that
feeling
of
oppression
he
supposed
that
makes
one
sigh
as
though
there
were
a
weight
on
the
heart
and
certain
little
memories
made
it
acute
sudden
flashing
vivid
recollection
of
that
last
drive
was
like
a
sharp
jagged
tear
had
they
ever
been
on
nearer
terms
and
had
she
treated
him
badly
it
would
not
have
caused
this
slow
and
insidious
suffering
he
was
a
man
of
spirit
he
was
proud
and
energetic
he
would
have
thrown
it
off
if
he
could
have
been
angry
with
her
or
despised
her
he
could
have
cured
himself
in
time
instead
of
that
all
the
recollections
were
of
an
almost
sickening
sweetness
particularly
that
kiss
on
the
day
he
went
to
see
her
and
the
other
the
was
also
the
last
so
it
had
a
greater
bitterness
sharper
than
a
sword
joy
like
o
sudden
spear
these
words
casually
read
somewhere
came
back
to
him
whenever
he
remembered
her
aylmer
had
read
heard
of
these
obsessions
but
never
believed
in
them
it
was
folly
madness
he
stood
up
tossing
his
head
as
though
to
throw
it
off
he
went
to
fetch
some
friends
went
with
them
to
see
pictures
to
have
tea
and
to
drive
in
the
bois
accepting
also
an
invitation
to
dine
with
a
man
a
nice
boy
a
fellow
who
had
been
at
oxford
with
him
and
was
at
the
embassy
here
a
young
attaché
he
was
quite
nice
a
little
dull
and
a
little
too
fond
of
talking
about
his
chief
aylmer
got
home
at
about
six
to
dress
for
dinner
then
the
torture
began
again
it
was
always
worse
towards
evening
an
agony
of
longing
regret
fury
vague
jealousy
and
desire
he
stood
and
looked
out
of
the
window
again
at
the
crowd
hurrying
along
now
to
their
pleasures
or
their
happy
homes
so
many
people
in
the
world
like
stars
in
the
sky
why
want
the
one
star
only
why
cry
for
the
moon
he
had
no
photograph
of
her
but
he
still
thought
she
was
like
his
mother
miniature
and
often
looked
at
it
he
wished
he
was
going
to
dine
with
that
young
man
tonight
aylmer
was
the
most
genial
and
sociable
of
men
he
usually
disliked
being
alone
yet
just
now
being
with
people
bored
him
it
seemed
an
interruption
he
was
going
through
a
crisis
yes
he
could
not
stand
anyone
this
evening
he
rang
the
bell
and
sent
a
to
say
he
was
prevented
from
dining
with
his
friend
what
a
relief
when
he
had
sent
this
now
he
could
think
of
her
alone
in
peace
she
had
never
asked
him
to
go
away
it
was
his
own
idea
he
had
come
away
to
get
over
it
well
he
had
got
over
it
he
was
worse
but
it
was
because
he
did
see
her
no
he
did
deceive
himself
the
more
he
saw
of
her
the
worse
he
would
be
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
was
capable
of
feeling
so
intensely
and
deeply
as
aylmer
felt
and
never
in
his
life
before
had
he
felt
anything
like
it
and
now
it
came
on
again
with
the
ebb
and
flow
of
passion
like
an
illness
why
was
he
so
miserable
why
would
nothing
else
do
he
suddenly
remembered
with
a
smile
that
when
he
was
five
years
old
he
had
adored
a
certain
nurse
and
for
some
reason
or
other
his
mother
sent
her
away
he
had
cried
and
cried
for
her
to
come
back
he
remembered
even
now
how
people
had
said
the
child
will
soon
forget
but
he
wore
out
their
patience
he
cried
himself
to
sleep
every
night
and
his
perseverance
had
at
last
been
rewarded
after
six
weeks
the
nurse
came
back
his
mother
sent
for
her
in
despair
at
the
boy
misery
how
well
he
remembered
that
evening
and
her
plain
brown
face
with
the
twinkling
eyes
how
he
kissed
his
mother
and
thanked
her
the
nurse
stayed
till
he
went
to
school
and
then
he
soon
forgot
all
about
her
perhaps
it
was
in
his
nature
at
rare
intervals
to
want
one
particular
person
so
terribly
to
pine
and
die
for
someone
that
was
a
recollection
of
babyhood
and
yet
he
remembered
even
now
that
obstinate
aching
longing
he
suddenly
felt
angry
furious
what
was
edith
doing
now
saying
to
archie
and
dilly
they
certainly
did
look
as
she
had
said
heavenly
angels
in
their
night
attire
he
had
been
privileged
to
see
them
then
she
was
dressing
for
dinner
and
going
out
with
bruce
good
heavens
what
noble
action
had
bruce
ever
done
for
that
he
should
go
away
why
make
such
a
sacrifice
for
bruce
perhaps
sometimes
she
really
missed
him
a
little
they
had
had
great
fun
together
she
looked
upon
him
as
a
friend
not
only
that
but
he
knew
that
he
amused
her
that
she
liked
him
thought
him
clever
and
admired
him
even
but
that
was
all
yet
she
have
cared
for
him
he
knew
that
and
not
only
in
one
way
but
in
every
way
they
could
have
been
comrades
interested
in
the
same
things
they
had
the
same
sense
of
humour
much
the
same
point
of
view
she
would
have
made
him
probably
and
patient
as
she
was
in
certain
things
but
in
others
would
he
have
fired
her
with
his
own
ideas
and
feelings
and
violent
passions
and
enthusiasms
she
was
to
be
always
with
bruce
that
was
to
be
her
life
bruce
who
was
almost
indescribable
because
he
was
neither
bad
nor
stupid
nor
he
had
only
one
fault
défaut
il
est
impossible
said
aylmer
aloud
to
himself
he
took
up
a
book
of
course
one
of
books
something
she
had
lent
him
now
it
was
time
to
go
out
again
to
dinner
he
could
it
was
too
much
effort
tonight
he
would
give
way
and
suffer
grief
and
desire
and
longing
like
a
physical
pain
he
had
heard
from
her
lately
suppose
she
should
be
ill
suppose
she
was
forgetting
him
entirely
soon
they
would
be
going
away
to
some
summer
place
with
the
children
he
stamped
his
foot
like
an
angry
child
as
he
imagined
her
in
her
thin
summer
clothes
how
people
would
admire
her
how
young
she
would
look
why
could
he
find
some
fault
with
her
imagine
her
cold
priggish
dull
too
cautious
but
he
could
only
think
of
her
as
lovely
as
beyond
expression
attractive
drawing
him
like
a
magnet
as
marvellously
kind
gentle
graceful
and
clever
he
was
obliged
to
use
the
stupid
word
clever
as
there
was
no
other
he
suddenly
remembered
her
teeth
when
she
smiled
and
a
certain
slight
wave
in
her
thick
hair
that
was
a
natural
one
it
is
really
barely
decent
to
write
about
poor
aylmer
as
he
is
alone
suffering
thinking
himself
unwatched
he
suddenly
threw
himself
on
his
bed
and
gave
way
to
a
crisis
of
despair
about
an
hour
later
when
the
pain
had
somehow
become
stupefied
he
lit
a
cigarette
ashamed
of
his
emotion
even
to
himself
and
rang
the
servant
brought
him
a
letter
the
english
post
he
had
thought
so
much
of
her
felt
her
so
deeply
the
last
few
days
that
he
fancied
it
must
somehow
have
reached
her
he
read
dear
aylmer
glad
you
are
in
paris
it
seems
nearer
home
last
night
i
went
to
the
mitchells
and
mr
mitchell
disguised
himself
as
a
russian
count
nobody
worried
about
it
and
then
he
went
and
undisguised
himself
again
but
lady
hartland
worried
about
it
and
as
she
did
know
the
mitchells
before
when
he
was
introduced
to
her
properly
she
begged
him
to
give
her
the
address
of
that
charming
russian
and
vincy
was
there
and
darling
vincy
told
me
you
written
him
a
letter
saying
you
so
very
happy
and
oh
aylmer
i
do
see
the
point
of
your
waiting
till
september
to
come
back
why
do
you
come
going
away
for
archie
holidays
come
back
and
see

night

edith
the
bell
was
rung
violently
orders
were
given
arrangements
made
packing
was
done
aylmer
was
suddenly
quite
well
quite
happy
in
a
few
hours
he
was
in
the
midnight
express
due
to
arrive
in
london
at
six
in
the
morning
happy
beyond
expression
by
ten
in
the
morning
he
would
hear
her
voice
on
the
telephone
he
met
a
poor
man
just
outside
the
hotel
selling
matches
in
rags
aylmer
gave
him
three
hundred
francs
he
pretended
to
himself
that
he
did
want
any
more
french
money
he
felt
he
wanted
someone
else
to
be
happy
too
chapter
xviii
a
contretemps
edith
did
not
know
herself
what
had
induced
her
to
write
that
letter
to
paris
some
gradual
obscure
influence
in
an
impulsive
moment
of
weakness
a
conventional
dread
of
paris
for
one
idol
then
what
vincy
told
her
had
convinced
her
aylmer
was
unhappy
she
thought
that
surely
there
might
be
some
compromise
that
matters
could
be
adjusted
could
they
go
on
seeing
each
other
just
as
friends
surely
both
would
be
happier
than
separated
for
yes
there
was
no
doubt
she
missed
him
and
longed
to
see
him
is
there
any
woman
in
the
world
on
whom
a
sincere
declaration
from
a
charming
interesting
person
make
an
impression
and
particularly
if
that
person
goes
away
practically
the
next
day
leaving
a
blank
edith
had
a
high
opinion
of
her
own
strength
of
will
when
she
appeared
weak
it
was
on
some
subject
about
which
she
was
indifferent
she
took
a
great
pride
in
her
own
her
which
was
neither
coldness
nor
density
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
bear
always
with
the
little
irritations
bruce
caused
her
to
guide
him
in
the
right
direction
keep
her
influence
with
him
in
order
to
be
able
to
arrange
everything
about
the
children
just
as
she
wished
the
children
were
a
deep
and
intense
preoccupation
to
say
she
adored
them
is
insufficient
archie
she
regarded
almost
as
her
greatest
friend
dilly
as
a
pet
for
both
she
had
the
strongest
feeling
that
a
mother
could
have
and
yet
the
fact
remained
that
they
did
not
nearly
fill
her
life
with
edith
intellect
and
temperament
they
could
only
fill
a
part
bending
down
to
a
lower
stature
of
intelligence
all
day
long
would
make
one
head
ache
standing
on
tiptoe
and
stretching
up
would
do
the
same
one
needs
a
contemporary
and
a
comrade
perhaps
till
edith
met
aylmer
she
had
not
quite
realised
what
such
real
comradeship
might
mean
coupled
with
another
feeling
not
the
intellectual
sympathy
she
had
for
vincy
but
something
quite
different
when
she
recollected
their
last
drive
her
heart
beat
quickly
and
the
little
memories
of
the
few
weeks
of
their
gave
her
unwonted
moments
of
sentiment
above
all
it
was
a
real
solid
happiness
an
uplifting
pleasure
to
believe
he
was
utterly
devoted
to
her
and
so
in
a
moment
of
depression
a
feeling
of
the
sense
of
the
futility
of
her
life
she
had
perhaps
a
little
wantonly
written
to
ask
him
to
come
back
it
is
human
to
play
with
what
one
loves
she
thought
she
had
a
soft
tender
admiration
for
him
that
he
had
a
charm
for
her
that
she
admired
him
but
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
on
her
side
there
was
anything
that
could
disturb
her
in
any
way
and
so
that
his
sentiment
which
she
had
found
to
be
rather
infectious
should
never
carry
her
away
she
meant
only
to
see
him
now
and
then
to
meet
again
and
be
friends
as
soon
as
she
had
written
the
letter
and
sent
it
she
felt
again
a
cheerful
excitement
she
felt
sure
he
would
come
in
a
day
or
two
aylmer
arrived
as
i
have
said
eight
hours
after
he
received
the
letter
his
first
intention
was
to
ring
her
up
or
to
speak
to
bruce
on
the
telephone
but
it
so
happened
that
it
was
engaged
this
decided
him
to
have
a
short
rest
and
then
go
and
surprise
her
with
a
visit
he
thought
he
would
have
lunch
at
one
he
knew
she
always
lunched
with
the
children
at
this
hour
and
would
call
on
her
unexpectedly
at
two
before
she
would
have
time
to
go
out
they
might
have
a
long
talk
he
would
give
her
the
books
and
things
he
had
bought
for
her
and
he
would
have
the
pleasure
of
surprising
her
and
seeing
on
her
face
that
first
look
that
can
disguise
the
look
of
real
welcome
merely
to
be
back
in
the
same
town
made
him
nearly
wild
with
joy
how
jolly
london
looked
at
the
beginning
of
july
so
gay
so
full
of
life
and
then
he
read
a
letter
in
a
writing
he
did
know
it
was
from
mavis
argles
the
friend
of
vincy
the
young
vincy
had
given
her
his
address
some
time
ago
asking
him
for
some
special
privilege
which
he
possessed
to
see
some
of
the
chinese
pictures
in
the
british
museum
he
was
to
oblige
her
with
a
letter
to
the
museum
she
would
call
for
it
vincy
was
away
and
evidently
she
had
by
accident
chosen
the
day
of
aylmer
return
without
knowing
anything
of
his
absence
she
had
never
seen
him
in
her
life
aylmer
was
wandering
about
the
house
with
nothing
to
do
restlessly
counting
the
minutes
till
two
in
the
afternoon
he
remembered
the
very
little
that
vincy
had
told
him
of
mavis
how
proud
she
was
and
how
hard
up
he
saw
her
through
the
window
she
looked
pale
and
rather
shabby
he
told
the
servant
to
show
her
in
just
this
moment
got
your
letter
miss
argles
but
of
course
i
only
too
delighted
you
mr
vincy
said
you
give
me
the
letter
the
girl
sat
down
stiffly
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
vincy
had
said
she
was
pretty
aylmer
could
not
see
it
but
he
felt
brimming
over
with
sympathy
and
kindness
for
her
for
everyone
in
fact
she
wore
a
thin
light
grey
cotton
dress
and
a
small
grey
hat
her
hair
looked
rich
red
and
fluffy
as
ever
her
face
white
and
rather
thin
she
looked
about
seventeen
when
she
smiled
she
was
pretty
she
had
a
rossetti
mouth
that
must
have
been
what
vincy
admired
aylmer
had
no
idea
that
vincy
did
more
than
admire
her
very
mildly
you
let
me
take
you
there
suggested
aylmer
suddenly
he
had
nothing
on
earth
to
do
and
thought
it
would
fill
up
the
time
i
drive
you
there
and
show
you
the
pictures
and
then
would
you
come
and
have
lunch
i
got
an
appointment
at
two
she
firmly
declined
lunch
but
consented
that
he
should
drive
her
and
they
went
aylmer
talked
with
the
eagerness
produced
by
his
restless
excitement
and
she
listened
with
interest
somewhat
fascinated
as
people
always
were
with
his
warmth
and
vitality
as
they
were
driving
along
oxford
street
edith
walking
with
archie
saw
them
clearly
she
had
been
taking
him
on
some
mission
of
clothes
for
the
children
only
she
went
into
shops
he
was
talking
with
such
animation
that
he
did
not
see
her
to
a
pale
young
girl
with
bright
red
hair
edith
knew
the
girl
by
sight
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
was
vincy
friend
there
was
a
photograph
of
her
at
his
rooms
aylmer
did
not
see
her
after
a
start
she
kept
it
to
herself
she
walked
a
few
steps
then
got
into
a
cab
she
felt
ill
so
aylmer
had
never
got
her
letter
he
had
been
in
london
without
telling
her
he
had
forgotten
her
perhaps
he
was
deceiving
her
and
he
was
making
love
obviously
to
that
sickening
irritating
fool
so
edith
thought
of
her
vincy
silly
affected
when
edith
went
home
she
had
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
she
never
even
asked
herself
what
right
she
had
to
mind
so
much
she
only
knew
it
hurt
a
messenger
boy
at
once
of
course
mr
ross
i
saw
you
this
morning
i
wrote
you
a
line
to
paris
not
knowing
you
had
returned
when
you
get
the
note
forwarded
will
you
do
me
the
little
favour
to
tear
it
up
unopened

sure
you
will
do
this
to
please
me

going
away
in
a
day
or
two
but
i
do
know
where
please
do
trouble
to
come
and
see
me
ottley
aylmer
left
miss
argles
at
the
british
museum
when
he
went
back
he
found
this
letter
chapter
xix
an
extraordinary
afternoon
aylmer
guessed
at
once
she
had
seen
him
driving
being
a
man
of
sense
and
not
an
impossible
hero
in
a
feuilleton
instead
of
going
away
again
and
leaving
the
misunderstanding
to
ripen
he
went
to
the
telephone
endeavoured
to
get
on
and
to
explain
in
few
words
what
had
obviously
happened
to
follow
the
explanation
by
an
immediate
visit
was
his
plan
though
of
course
slightly
irritated
that
she
had
seen
him
under
circumstances
conveying
a
false
impression
on
the
other
hand
he
was
delighted
at
the
pique
her
letter
showed
especially
coming
immediately
after
the
almost
tender
letter
in
paris
he
rang
and
rang
and
used
language
and
after
much
difficulty
getting
an
answer
he
asked
he
could
not
get
a
pathetic
question
asked
plaintively
by
many
people
not
only
on
the
telephone
line
is
out
of
order
in
about
twenty
minutes
he
was
at
her
door
the
lift
seemed
to
him
preternaturally
slow
ottley
ottley
is
not
at
home
sir
at
his
blank
expression
the
servant
who
knew
him
and
of
course
liked
him
as
they
always
did
offered
the
further
information
that
mrs
ottley
had
gone
out
for
the
whole
afternoon
the
children
at
home
or
out
with
miss
townsend
children
are
out
sir
but
not
with
miss
townsend
they
are
spending
the
day
with
their
grandmother
do
you
happen
to
know
if
mr
and
mrs
ottley
will
be
at
home
to
dinner
heard
nothing
to
the
contrary
sir
i
come
in
and
write
a
note
he
went
into
the
little
it
was
intensely
associated
with
her
he
felt
a
little
ému
there
was
the
there
the
bookcase
the
few
chairs
the
grey
walls
some
pale
roses
fading
in
a
pewter
vase
the
restfulness
of
the
surroundings
filled
him
and
feeling
happier
he
wrote
on
the
grey
notepaper
mrs
ottley
i
arrived
early
this
morning
i
started
in
fact
from
paris
immediately
after
receiving
a
few
lines
you
very
kindly
sent
me
there
i
so
disappointed
not
to
see
you
unless
i
hear
to
the
contrary
and
even
if
i
do
i
think
i
propose
to
come
round
this
evening
about
nine
and
tell
you
and
bruce
all
about
my
travels
my
country
manners
in
thus
inviting
myself
but
i
know
you
will
say
no
if
you
do
want
me
and
in
that
case
i
shall
have
to
come
another
time
very
soon
instead
as
i
really
must
see
you
and
show
you
something
i
got
for
archie
yours
always
he
paused
and
then
added
he
went
to
his
club
there
to
try
and
pass
the
time
until
the
evening
he
meant
to
go
in
the
evening
even
if
she
put
him
off
again
and
if
they
were
out
to
wait
until
they
returned
pretending
he
had
not
heard
from
her
again
he
was
no
better
he
had
been
away
six
weeks
and
was
rather
more
in
love
than
ever
he
would
only
see
her
she
want
to
see
him
before
they
all
separated
for
the
summer
he
could
not
think
further
than
of
the
immediate
future
he
would
see
her
they
could
make
plans
afterwards
of
course
her
letter
was
simply
pique
she
had
given
herself
away
twice
once
in
the
angry
letter
also
in
the
previous
one
to
paris
where
was
she
now
what
did
it
mean
why
did
she
go
out
for
the
whole
afternoon
where
was
she
after
edith
had
written
and
sent
her
letter
to
aylmer
in
the
morning
mrs
ottley
the
elder
came
to
fetch
the
children
to
dine
and
edith
told
miss
townsend
to
go
for
the
afternoon
she
was
glad
she
would
be
absolutely
alone
you
very
well
dear
mrs
ottley
asked
this
young
lady
in
her
sweet
sympathetic
way
edith
was
fond
of
her
and
by
implication
only
occasionally
confided
in
her
on
other
subjects
than
the
children
today
however
edith
answered
that
she
was
well
but
was
going
to
see
about
things
before
they
went
away
do
know
how
we
shall
manage
without
you
for
the
holidays
miss
townsend
i
think
you
had
better
come
with
us
for
the
first
fortnight
if
you
do
mind
much
miss
townsend
said
she
would
do
whatever
edith
liked
she
could
easily
arrange
to
go
with
them
at
once
this
was
a
relief
for
just
at
this
moment
edith
felt
as
if
even
the
children
would
be
a
burden
sweet
gentle
miss
townsend
went
away
she
was
dressed
rather
like
herself
edith
observed
she
imitated
edith
she
had
the
soft
graceful
manner
and
sweet
voice
of
her
employer
she
was
slim
and
had
a
pretty
figure
but
was
entirely
without
edith
charm
or
beauty
vaguely
edith
wondered
if
she
would
ever
have
a
love
affair
ever
marry
she
hoped
so
but
selfishly
not
till
archie
went
to
eton
then
she
found
herself
looking
at
her
lonely
lunch
she
tried
to
eat
gave
it
up
asked
for
a
cup
of
tea
at
last
she
could
bear
the
flat
no
longer
it
was
a
glorious
day
very
hot
edith
felt
peculiar
she
thought
that
if
she
spent
all
the
afternoon
out
and
alone
it
would
comfort
her
and
she
would
think
it
out
trees
and
sky
and
sun
had
always
a
soothing
effect
on
her
she
went
out
walked
a
little
felt
worried
by
the
crowd
of
shoppers
swarming
to
sloane
street
and
the
brompton
road
got
into
a
taxi
and
drove
to
the
gate
of
kensington
gardens
opposite
kensington
gore
here
she
soon
found
a
seat
at
this
time
of
the
day
the
gardens
were
rather
unoccupied
and
in
the
burning
july
afternoon
she
felt
almost
as
if
in
the
country
she
took
off
her
gloves
a
gesture
habitual
with
her
whenever
possible
she
looked
utterly
restful
she
had
nothing
in
her
hands
for
she
never
carried
either
a
parasol
or
a
bag
nor
even
in
winter
a
muff
or
in
the
evening
a
fan
all
these
little
accessories
seemed
unnecessary
to
her
she
liked
to
simplify
she
hated
fuss
anything
worrying
agitating
and
now
she
felt
deeply
miserable
perturbed
and
agitated
what
a
punishment
for
giving
way
to
that
half
impulse
that
had
made
her
write
to
paris
she
had
begged
him
to
come
back
while
really
he
was
here
and
had
not
even
let
her
know
she
had
never
liked
what
she
had
heard
of
mavis
argles
but
had
vaguely
pitied
her
wondering
what
vincy
saw
in
her
and
wishing
to
believe
the
best
now
she
assumed
the
worst
as
soon
as
vincy
had
gone
out
of
town
he
was
staying
in
surrey
with
some
of
his
relatives
she
the
minx
began
flirting
or
carrying
on
with
aylmer
how
far
had
it
gone
she
wondered
jealously
she
did
not
believe
aylmer
to
be
harmless
he
was
so
easily
carried
away
his
feelings
were
impulsive
yet
it
was
only
a
very
short
time
since
vincy
had
told
her
of
miserable
letter
edith
was
not
interested
in
herself
and
seldom
thought
much
of
her
own
feelings
but
she
hated
and
now
she
faced
facts
she
adored
aylmer
it
had
been
purely
jealousy
that
made
her
write
to
paris
so
touchingly
asking
him
to
come
back
vague
fears
that
if
he
were
so
depressed
in
spain
perhaps
he
might
try
by
amusements
to
forget
her
in
paris
he
had
once
said
to
her
that
of
all
places
he
thought
paris
the
least
attractive
for
a
romance
because
it
was
all
so
obvious
so
prepared
so
professional
he
liked
the
unexpected
the
veiled
and
somewhat
more
hypocritical
atmosphere
and
in
the
fogs
of
london
he
had
said
were
more
romantic
mysteries
than
in
any
other
city
still
she
had
feared
and
besides
she
longed
to
see
him
so
she
had
unbent
and
thought
herself
soon
after
somewhat
reckless
it
was
a
little
wanton
and
unfair
to
bring
him
back
but
she
was
not
a
saint
she
was
a
woman
and
sometimes
bruce
was
trying
edith
belonged
to
the
superior
class
of
human
being
whom
jealousy
chills
and
cures
and
does
not
stimulate
to
further
efforts
it
was
not
in
her
to
go
in
for
competition
the
moment
she
believed
someone
else
took
her
place
she
relaxed
her
hold
this
is
the
finer
temperament
but
it
suffers
most
she
would
not
try
to
take
aylmer
away
let
him
remain
with
his
miss
argles
he
might
even
marry
her
he
deserved
it
she
meant
to
tell
vincy
of
course
poor
vincy
did
know
of
the
treachery
now
she
must
devote
herself
to
the
children
and
be
good
and
kind
to
bruce
at
least
bruce
was
to
her
in
his
way
he
had
been
in
love
when
they
married
but
edith
shrewdly
suspected
he
was
not
capable
of
very
much
more
than
a
weak
rather
fatuous
sentiment
for
any
woman
and
anyone
but
herself
would
have
lost
him
many
years
ago
would
very
likely
have
given
him
up
but
she
had
kept
it
all
together
had
really
helped
him
and
was
touched
when
she
remembered
that
jealous
scene
he
made
about
the
letter
the
letter
she
would
at
first
let
him
see
poor
bruce
well
they
were
linked
together
there
were
archie
the
angel
and
dilly
the
pet
she
was
and
aylmer
forty
he
ought
not
to
hold
so
strong
a
position
in
her
mind
but
he
did
yes
she
was
in
love
with
him
in
a
way
it
was
a
mania
an
obsession
but
she
would
now
soon
wrestle
with
it
and
conquer
it
the
great
charm
had
been
his
exclusive
devotion
but
also
his
appearance
his
figure
his
voice
he
looked
sunburnt
and
handsome
he
was
laughing
as
he
talked
to
the
miserable
creature
so
edith
called
her
in
her
own
mind
then
edith
had
a
reaction
she
would
cure
herself
today
no
more
flirtation
no
more
amitié
amoureuse
they
were
going
away
the
children
darlings
how
they
loved
her
and
bruce
she
was
reminding
herself
she
must
be
gentle
good
to
bruce
he
had
at
least
never
deceived
her
she
got
up
and
walked
on
and
on
it
was
about
five
now
as
she
walked
she
thought
how
fortunate
she
was
in
miss
townsend
what
a
nice
girl
she
was
what
a
good
friend
to
her
and
the
children
she
had
a
sort
of
intuition
that
made
her
always
have
the
right
word
the
right
manner
she
had
seemed
a
little
odd
lately
but
she
was
quite
pleased
to
come
with
them
to
the
country
what
made
her
think
of
miss
townsend
some
way
off
was
a
girl
with
her
back
to
edith
walking
with
a
man
her
figure
was
like
miss
townsend
and
she
wore
a
dress
like
the
one
copied
from
edith
edith
walked
more
quickly
it
was
the
retired
part
of
the
gardens
on
the
way
towards
the
bayswater
road
the
two
figures
turned
down
a
flowery
path
it
was
miss
townsend
she
had
turned
her
face
edith
was
surprised
was
interested
and
walked
on
a
few
steps
she
had
not
seen
the
man
clearly
then
they
both
sat
down
on
a
seat
he
took
her
hand
she
left
it
in
his
there
was
something
familiar
in
his
figure
and
clothes
and
edith
saw
his
face
yes
it
was
bruce
edith
turned
round
and
went
home
chapter
xx
journeys
end
so
that
was
how
bruce
behaved
to
her
the
deceit
of
both
of
them
hurt
her
immensely
but
she
pulled
herself
together
it
was
a
case
for
action
she
felt
a
bitter
amused
contempt
but
she
felt
it
to
do
anything
that
would
lead
to
a
life
of
miserable
bickering
and
mutual
harm
it
must
be
stopped
and
without
making
bruce
hate
her
she
wrote
the
second
note
of
this
strange
day
and
sent
it
by
a
messenger
giving
no
reason
of
any
kind
she
told
the
governess
that
she
had
decided
the
children
holidays
should
begin
from
that
day
and
that
she
was
unexpectedly
going
away
with
them
almost
immediately
and
she
added
that
she
would
not
require
miss
townsend
any
more
she
enclosed
a
cheque
and
said
she
would
send
on
some
books
and
small
possessions
that
miss
townsend
had
kept
there
this
was
sent
by
a
messenger
to
miss
townsend
home
near
westbourne
grove
she
would
find
it
on
her
return
from
her
walk
and
now
edith
read
aylmer
note
it
was
so
real
so
sincere
she
began
to
disbelieve
her
eyes
this
morning
it
gave
her
more
courage
she
wanted
to
be
absolutely
calm
and
looking
her
very
best
for
bruce
entrance
he
came
in
with
his
key
he
avoided
her
eye
a
little
looked
rather
sheepish
she
thought
it
was
about
seven
are
the
children
in
yet
far
too
late
for
them
to
be
out
fetched
dilly
she
has
gone
to
bed
archie
is
coming
presently
mother
will
send
him
all
right
are
you
edith
old
girl
quite
well
bruce
have
a
sort
of
idea
as
you
know
he
said
growing
more
at
ease
we
shall
rather
miss
a
miss
townsend
when
we
first
go
away
what
do
you
think
of
taking
her
for
part
of
the
time
ready
announced
edith
and
they
dined
towards
the
end
of
dinner
he
was
about
to
make
the
suggestion
again
when
edith
said
in
clear
calm
but
decided
tones
i
am
not
going
to
take
miss
townsend
away
with
us
she
is
not
coming
any
more
why
what
the
devil
the
idea
of
this
new
scheme
what
the
matter
with
miss
townsend
answered
edith
prefer
not
to
go
into
the
question
and
later
you
will
be
glad
i
did
not
i
decided
that
miss
townsend
is
not
to
come
any
more
at
all
i
written
to
tell
her
so
i
look
after
the
children
with
nurse
until
we
come
back
it
all
settled
bruce
was
silent
upon
my
word
he
exclaimed
looking
at
her
uneasily
it
your
own
way
of
course
but
upon
my
word
why
you
really
want
me
to
tell
you
exactly
why
i
would
so
much
prefer
not
all
right
edith
dear
after
all
hang
it
all
you
the
children
mother
it
for
you
to
settle
no
i
do
want
to
know
anything
have
it
as
you
wish
we
wo
discuss
it
again
shall
we
right
he
was
looking
really
rather
shamefaced
and
she
thought
she
saw
a
gleam
of
remorse
and
also
of
relief
in
his
eye
she
went
into
the
other
room
she
had
not
shown
him
aylmer
letter
after
ten
minutes
he
came
in
and
said
here
edith
make
what
arrangements
you
like
never
want
to
see
miss
townsend
again
she
looked
a
question
i
never
shall
she
was
really
pleased
at
this
and
held
out
her
hand
bruce
had
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
took
it
old
girl
i
think
i
go
round
to
the
club
for
an
hour
or
two
and
look
here
bruce
leave
it
to
me
to
tell
the
children
forget
after
the
holidays
archie
must
not
be
upset
you
do
edith
will
be
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
well
good
night
i
be
long
edith
was
really
delighted
she
felt
she
had
won
and
she
want
that
horrid
little
townsend
to
be
scored
off
was
it
natural
she
wanted
to
hear
no
more
about
it
there
was
a
ring
it
was
nine
it
was
aylmer
voice
chapter
xxi
the
great
exception
the
absurdly
simple
explanation
made
almost
in
dumb
show
by
action
rather
than
in
dialogue
was
soon
given
he
was
surprised
simply
enchanted
at
the
entire
frankness
of
her
recognition
she
acknowledged
openly
that
it
mattered
to
her
tremendously
whether
or
not
he
was
on
intimate
terms
or
flirting
with
little
miss
argles
or
with
little
miss
anybody
he
was
not
even
to
look
at
any
woman
except
herself
that
was
arranged
between
them
now
and
understood
they
were
side
by
side
with
hands
clasped
as
a
matter
of
course
things
taken
for
granted
that
he
formerly
never
dreamt
of
the
signs
of
emotion
in
her
face
he
attributed
of
course
to
the
morning
contretemps
knowing
nothing
of
the
other
trouble
heavenly
being
here
again
you
prettier
than
ever
edith
sweeter
than
ever
what
a
time
i
had
away
it
got
worse
and
worse
aylmer
far
too
good
and
kind
to
me
but
i
suffered
awfully
have
i
since
this
morning
i
felt
did
you
feel
tell
me
i
felt
when
i
saw
you
with
her
as
if
i
had
got
a
friend
in
the
world
i
felt
quite
alone
i
felt
as
if
the
ground
were
going
to
open
and
swallow
me
up
i
relied
on
you
so
much
far
more
than
i
knew
i
was
struck
dumb
and
rooted
to
the
spot
and
knocked
all
of
a
heap
in
a
manner
of
speaking
as
vincy
would
say
edith
went
on
laughing
now
you
cured
me
thoroughly
you
such
a
person
she
still
left
her
hand
in
his
her
eyes
were
very
bright
the
result
of
few
but
salt
tears
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
lifted
by
a
happy
smile
not
the
tantalising
smile
he
used
to
see
she
was
changed
and
was
he
thought
more
lovable
prettier
today
emotion
had
shaken
her
out
of
herself
the
reaction
of
this
evening
gave
a
brilliancy
to
her
eyes
happy
curves
to
her
lips
and
the
slight
disarrangement
of
her
hair
not
quite
tonight
gave
her
a
more
irresponsible
look
she
seemed
more
careless
younger
bruce
aylmer
asked
suddenly
gone
to
the
club
he
be
back
rather
soon
i
should
think
wo
wait
i
would
rather
not
meet
him
this
evening
when
shall
i
see
you
again
i
do
know
i
do
think
i
want
to
make
any
plans
now
you
wish
i
say
do
you
really
think
vincy
can
care
for
that
girl
believe
he
has
had
a
very
long
friendship
of
some
kind
with
her
he
never
told
me
actually
but
i
felt
it
edith
said
he
in
love
with
her
can
he
be
a
way
in
one
of
his
peculiar
ways
in
love
with
him
i
suppose
said
aylmer
was
only
because
she
thought
it
would
please
him
that
she
wanted
to
see
those
things
at
the
museum
i
think
she
a
little
anxious
i
found
her
a
wild
irritating
unaccountable
empty
creature
i
believe
she
wants
him
to
marry
her
hope
he
wo
unless
he
wants
to
said
edith
would
be
a
mistake
for
vincy
to
sacrifice
himself
as
much
as
that
hope
indeed
he
wo
exclaimed
aylmer
i
think
it
out
of
the
question
miss
argles
is
only
an
incident
surely
she
looks
the
slightest
of
episodes
a
very
long
episode
it
might
end
though
if
she
insists
and
he
wo
bother
never
mind
them
aylmer
replied
with
boyish
impatience
me
look
at
again
do
you
care
for
me
a
little
bit
edith
i
do
what
going
to
be
done
about
it
he
asked
with
happy
triviality
talk
nonsense
she
replied
just
going
to
see
each
other
sometimes
be
satisfied
with
anything
cried
aylmer
what
i
suffered
not
seeing
you
at
all
we
have
a
new
game
you
shall
the
rules
and
i
keep
them
the
summer
no
plans
tonight
i
must
think
she
looked
thoughtful
me
how
archie
he
said
all
right
delightful
dilly
too
but
i
rather
bothered
should
you
bother
what
it
about
tell
me
at
once
she
paused
a
moment
townsend
wo
be
able
to
come
back
any
more
she
said
steadily
what
a
pity
i
suppose
the
fool
of
a
girl
engaged
or
something
wo
come
back
any
more
answered
edith
you
have
to
get
a
new
miss
townsend
thought
of
being
their
governess
myself
during
the
holidays
anyhow
that
will
leave
you
hardly
any
time
no
leisure
for
what
anything
for
me
for
instance
said
aylmer
boldly
he
was
full
of
the
courage
and
audacity
caused
by
the
immense
relief
of
seeing
her
again
and
finding
her
so
responsive
there
is
of
course
no
joy
so
great
as
the
cessation
of
pain
in
fact
all
joy
active
or
passive
is
the
cessation
of
some
pain
since
it
must
be
the
satisfaction
of
a
longing
even
perhaps
an
unconscious
longing
a
desire
is
a
sort
of
pain
even
with
hope
without
it
is
despair
when
for
example
one
takes
artistic
pleasure
in
looking
at
something
beautiful
that
is
a
cessation
of
the
pain
of
having
been
deprived
of
it
until
then
since
what
one
enjoys
one
must
have
longed
for
even
without
knowing
it
here
said
aylmer
suddenly
do
believe
i
can
do
without
you
said
was
to
make
the
rules
them
then
go
on
we
be
intimate
friends
and
meet
as
often
as
we
can
once
a
week
you
may
say
you
care
for
me
and
i
say
the
same
that
all
if
you
find
you
do
like
it
ca
stand
it
as
you
say
then
have
to
go
away
again
agree
to
it
all
to
every
word
you
see
if
i
do
stick
to
it
absolutely
you
dear
aylmer
he
paused
i
must
kiss
you
never
again
right
never
again
after
tonight
tonight
is
the
great
exception
said
aylmer
she
made
a
tardy
and
futile
protest
then
she
said
aylmer
you
must
go
she
sighed
have
a
lot
of
worries
never
heard
you
say
that
before
let
me
take
them
and
demolish
them
for
you
ca
you
give
them
to
me
i
shall
give
nothing
more
to
you
there
are
to
be
no
more
exceptions
said
edith
promise
she
sat
quietly
alone
for
waiting
for
bruce
she
now
felt
sorry
for
bruce
utterly
and
completely
indifferent
about
townsend
case
as
she
already
humorously
called
it
to
herself
but
she
thought
she
be
strong
she
was
not
prepared
to
lose
her
dignity
nor
to
allow
the
children
to
be
educated
by
a
woman
whose
faith
at
least
with
them
and
in
their
home
was
unreliable
their
surroundings
must
be
it
would
make
a
certain
difference
to
them
she
thought
how
could
it
not
there
were
so
many
little
ways
in
which
she
might
spoil
them
or
tease
them
scamp
things
or
rush
them
or
be
nicer
to
one
of
them
or
less
nice
if
she
had
any
sort
of
concealed
relation
with
their
father
and
as
she
had
been
treated
absolutely
as
a
confidante
by
edith
the
girl
had
certainly
shown
herself
treacherous
and
rather
too
clearly
capable
of
dissimulation
edith
thought
this
must
have
a
bad
effect
on
the
children
edith
was
essentially
a
very
feminine
woman
though
she
had
a
mental
attitude
rightly
held
to
be
more
characteristic
of
men
being
so
feminine
so
enraged
under
her
calm
and
ease
she
was
of
course
not
completely
consistent
she
was
still
angry
and
very
scornful
of
miss
townsend
she
was
hurt
with
her
she
felt
a
friend
had
played
her
false
a
friend
too
in
the
position
of
deepest
trust
of
grave
responsibility
miss
townsend
knew
perfectly
well
what
the
children
were
to
edith
and
for
all
she
knew
there
was
in
edith
life
except
bruce
so
that
it
was
rather
cruel
edith
intended
to
keep
up
her
dignity
so
absolutely
that
miss
townsend
could
never
see
her
again
that
she
could
never
speak
to
edith
on
the
subject
she
wished
also
much
that
bruce
should
never
see
her
again
but
did
know
how
to
encompass
this
she
must
find
a
way
on
the
other
hand
after
the
first
shock
and
disgust
at
seeing
him
edith
anger
with
bruce
himself
had
entirely
passed
had
she
not
known
for
years
that
he
was
a
little
weak
a
little
fatuous
he
was
just
as
good
a
sort
now
as
he
had
ever
been
and
as
she
was
not
blinded
by
the
resentment
and
fury
of
the
real
jealousy
of
passion
edith
saw
clearly
and
knew
that
bruce
cared
far
more
for
than
for
anybody
else
that
in
so
far
as
he
could
love
anybody
he
loved
her
in
his
way
and
she
wanted
to
keep
the
whole
thing
together
on
account
of
archie
and
for
dilly
sake
she
must
be
so
kind
yet
so
strong
that
bruce
would
be
at
once
grateful
for
her
forbearance
and
afraid
to
take
advantage
of
it
rather
a
difficult
undertaking
and
she
had
seen
aylmer
again
there
was
nothing
in
it
about
miss
argles
what
happiness
she
ought
to
have
trusted
him
he
cared
for
her
he
loved
her
his
sentiment
was
worth
having
and
she
cared
for
him
too
how
much
she
did
quite
know
she
admired
him
he
fascinated
her
and
she
also
felt
a
deep
gratitude
because
he
gave
her
just
the
sort
of
passionate
worship
that
she
must
have
always
unconsciously
craved
for
certainly
the
two
little
events
of
today
had
drawn
her
nearer
to
him
she
had
been
far
less
reserved
that
evening
she
closed
her
eyes
and
smiled
to
herself
but
this
must
happen
again
with
a
strong
effort
of
she
banished
all
delightful
recollections
as
she
heard
bruce
come
up
in
the
lift
he
came
in
with
a
slightly
shy
uncomfortable
manner
again
she
felt
sorry
for
him
he
said
he
gave
her
a
quick
glance
a
sort
of
cautious
look
which
made
her
feel
rather
inclined
to
laugh
then
he
said
just
been
down
to
the
club
what
have
you
been
doing
been
here
know
he
was
in
town
only
come
for
a
few
days
should
like
to
see
him
said
bruce
looking
brighter
he
ask
after
me
he
looked
at
her
again
and
said
suspiciously
suppose
you
did
mention
what
he
cleared
his
throat
and
then
said
with
an
effort
of
that
she
thought
at
once
ridiculous
and
touching
here
i
do
wish
to
blame
you
in
any
way
for
what
er
arrangements
you
like
to
make
in
your
own
household
but
er
have
you
written
to
miss
townsend
she
wo
come
back
but
wo
she
ask
why
hope
not
asked
bruce
with
a
tinge
of
defiance
then
i
should
have
to
explain
and
i
do
like
explaining
there
was
another
pause
bruce
seemed
to
take
a
great
interest
in
his
nails
which
he
examined
separately
one
at
a
time
and
then
all
together
holding
both
hands
in
front
of
him
archie
enjoy
his
day
yes
said
edith
bruce
suddenly
stood
up
and
a
franker
more
manly
expression
came
into
his
face
he
looked
at
her
with
a
look
of
pain
tears
were
not
far
from
his
eyes
you
a
brick
you
too
good
for
me
she
looked
down
and
away
without
answering
here
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
please
you
there
is
i
do
it
whatever
it
is
on
my
word
of
honour
it
a
funny
thing
to
ask
you
but
you
know
our
late
governess
miss
townsend
i
should
like
you
to
promise
never
to
see
her
again
even
by
accident
if
you
meet
her
by
accident
i
mean
i
want
you
not
to
see
her
bruce
held
out
both
his
hands
swear
i
never
recognise
her
even
if
i
should
meet
her
accidentally
know
it
a
very
odd
thing
to
ask
continued
edith
a
fancy
why
should
i
mind
your
not
seeing
miss
townsend
he
did
answer
i
mind
and
i
be
grateful
edith
thought
one
might
be
unfaithful
without
being
disloyal
and
she
believed
bruce
now
she
was
too
sensible
to
ask
him
never
to
write
a
line
never
to
telephone
never
to
do
anything
else
besides
it
was
beneath
her
dignity
to
go
into
these
details
and
told
her
that
one
or
the
other
must
write
or
communicate
if
the
thing
was
to
be
stopped
if
miss
townsend
wrote
to
him
to
the
club
he
would
have
to
answer
bruce
meant
not
to
see
her
again
and
that
was
enough
you
not
cross
edith
not
depressed
she
gave
her
sweetest
smile
she
looked
brilliantly
happy
and
particularly
pretty
with
a
violent
reaction
of
remorse
and
a
sort
of
tenderness
he
tried
to
put
his
arm
round
her
she
moved
away
you
forgive
me
edith
for
anything
i
done
that
you
like
i
forgive
you
the
incident
is
closed
forgive
me
and
i
had
a
tiring
day
and
i
going
to
sleep
good
night
with
a
kind
little
nod
she
left
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
that
air
of
stupid
distinction
that
he
generally
assumed
when
in
a
lift
with
other
people
and
that
came
to
his
rescue
at
awkward
moments
a
dull
aloof
rather
haughty
expression
but
it
was
no
use
to
him
now
he
had
considerable
difficulty
in
refraining
from
venting
his
temper
on
the
poor
dumb
furniture
in
fact
he
did
give
a
kick
to
a
pretty
little
it
made
no
sound
but
its
curved
shoulder
looked
resentful
a
day
said
bruce
to
himself
he
went
to
his
room
pouting
like
archie
but
he
knew
he
had
got
off
cheaply
chapter
xxii
another
side
of
bruce
ever
since
his
earliest
youth
bruce
had
always
had
at
intervals
some
vague
vain
entanglement
with
a
woman
the
slightest
interest
practically
even
common
civility
shown
him
by
anyone
of
the
feminine
sex
between
the
ages
of
sixteen
and
sixty
flattered
his
vanity
to
such
an
extraordinary
extent
that
he
immediately
thought
these
ladies
were
in
love
with
him
and
it
did
take
much
more
for
him
to
be
in
love
with
them
and
yet
he
did
really
care
for
women
with
regard
to
them
his
point
of
view
was
entirely
that
of
vanity
and
in
fact
he
only
liked
both
men
or
women
who
made
up
to
him
or
who
gave
him
the
impression
that
they
did
edith
was
really
the
only
woman
for
whom
his
weak
and
flickering
passion
had
lingered
at
all
long
and
in
addition
to
that
the
first
glamour
of
which
had
faded
she
had
a
real
hold
over
him
he
felt
for
her
the
most
genuine
fondness
of
which
he
was
capable
besides
trust
and
a
certain
admiration
a
sort
of
respect
underlay
all
his
patronising
or
caprices
with
her
but
still
he
had
got
into
the
habit
of
some
feeble
flirtation
a
little
affair
and
at
first
he
missed
it
very
much
he
did
care
a
straw
for
miss
townsend
he
never
had
he
thought
her
plain
and
tedious
she
bored
him
more
than
any
woman
he
had
ever
met
and
yet
he
had
slipped
into
a
silly
sort
of
intrigue
beginning
by
a
few
words
of
pity
or
sympathy
to
her
and
by
the
idea
that
she
looked
up
to
him
in
admiration
he
was
very
much
ashamed
of
it
and
of
the
circumstances
he
was
not
proud
of
his
conquest
with
her
as
he
generally
was
he
felt
that
on
account
of
the
children
and
altogether
he
had
been
playing
it
a
bit
low
down
he
was
not
incapable
either
of
appreciating
edith
attitude
she
had
never
him
never
asked
him
for
a
single
detail
never
laboured
the
subject
nor
driven
the
point
home
nor
condescended
even
to
try
to
find
out
how
far
things
had
really
gone
she
had
even
told
him
how
she
knew
he
was
ashamed
to
ask
and
after
that
promise
of
forgiveness
she
never
referred
to
it
there
was
never
the
slightest
innuendo
teasing
reproach
yes
by
jove
edith
was
wonderful
and
so
bruce
meant
to
play
the
game
too
for
several
days
he
asked
the
porter
at
the
club
if
there
were
any
letters
receiving
the
usual
reply
sir
the
third
day
he
received
the
following
note
and
took
it
to
read
with
enjoyment
of
the
secrecy
combined
with
a
sort
of
shame
until
now
he
had
communicated
with
her
mr
ottley
of
course
you
know
i
not
returning
to
the
children
after
the
holidays
nor
am
i
going
with
you
to
westgate
i
very
unhappy
for
i
fear
i
have
offended
mrs
ottley
she
has
always
been
very
kind
to
me
till
now
but
i
shall
let
the
matter
rest
under
the
circumstances
i
suppose
i
shall
not
see
you
any
more
may
i
ask
that
you
should
not
call
or
write
i
and
mother
are
going
to
spend
the
summer
at
bexhill
with
some
friends
our
address
will
be
sandringham
seaview
road
bexhill
if
you
like
to
write
just
one
line
to
say
i
fear
i
have
been
rather
to
blame
in
seeing
you
without
mrs
ottley
knowledge
but
you
know
how
one
feelings
sometimes
lead
one
to
do
what
one
knows
one
ought
not
to
indeed
some
boarding
house
i
suppose
said
bruce
to
himself
a
lot
of
fine
grammar
for
a
governess
wishing
you
every
happiness
i
miss
the
children
yours
sincerely
margaret
townsend
i
shall
never
forget
how
happy
i
was
with
you
and
mrs
ottley
bruce
expression
as
he
read
the
last
line
was
rather
funny
a
silly
little
fool
and
i
sha
answer
he
reflected
the
letter
he
found
it
more
unsatisfactory
still
and
destroyed
it
the
thought
of
miss
townsend
bored
him
unutterably
and
indeed
he
was
incapable
of
caring
for
any
woman
however
feebly
for
more
than
two
or
three
weeks
he
was
particularly
fickle
vague
and
scrappy
in
his
emotions
edith
was
the
only
woman
for
whom
even
a
little
affection
could
last
and
he
would
have
long
tired
of
her
but
for
her
exceptional
character
and
the
extraordinary
trouble
and
tact
she
used
with
him
he
did
appreciate
her
fine
shades
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
value
her
as
another
man
might
have
done
but
he
was
always
coming
back
to
a
certain
steady
renewed
feeling
of
tenderness
for
her
with
the
curious
blindness
common
to
all
married
people
and
indeed
to
any
people
who
live
together
clever
edith
had
been
entirely
taken
in
in
a
certain
sense
she
had
always
felt
until
the
case
half
disdainfully
but
satisfactorily
certain
of
bruce
fidelity
she
knew
that
he
had
little
sham
flirtations
but
she
had
never
imagined
his
going
anywhere
near
an
intrigue
she
saw
now
that
in
that
she
had
been
duped
and
that
if
he
did
do
more
it
was
not
from
loyalty
to
her
still
she
now
felt
convinced
that
it
would
occur
again
she
had
treated
him
well
she
had
spared
him
in
the
matter
he
was
a
little
grateful
and
she
believed
he
would
be
straight
now
though
her
opinion
of
him
had
rather
gone
down
edith
always
felt
that
she
must
go
to
the
very
extreme
of
loyalty
to
anyone
who
was
faithful
to
her
she
valued
fidelity
so
deeply
and
now
this
feeling
was
naturally
relaxed
a
little
she
had
the
slightest
desire
for
revenge
but
she
felt
she
had
a
slightly
freer
hand
she
did
see
why
she
should
for
instance
deprive
herself
of
the
pleasure
of
seeing
aylmer
she
had
not
told
him
anything
about
it
that
day
at
the
club
bruce
in
his
depression
had
a
chat
with
goldthorpe
his
golfing
companion
and
sometime
confidant
over
a
cigarette
and
other
refreshments
bruce
murmured
how
he
had
put
an
end
to
the
little
affair
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
jolly
little
girl
she
was
yes
said
goldthorpe
indifferently
he
thought
edith
very
attractive
and
would
have
liked
to
have
the
duty
of
consoling
her
of
those
girls
that
sort
of
you
and
appeal
to
you
know
yes
eyes
no
by
jove
i
should
call
them
hazel
with
black
lashes
no
not
exactly
black
brown
nice
white
teeth
slim
figure
perhaps
a
bit
too
straight
brownish
hair
with
a
tinge
of
gold
in
the
sun
yes
twenty
continued
bruce
dreamily
he
knew
that
miss
townsend
was
but
suspected
goldthorpe
of
admiring
flappers
and
so
with
a
subconscious
desire
to
impress
him
rearranged
the
lady
age
twenty
if
that
rather
long
thin
hands
the
hands
of
a
lady
well
it
all
over
now
all
right
said
goldthorpe
he
seemed
to
have
had
enough
of
this
retrospective
inventory
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
he
had
an
appointment
bruce
thinking
he
seemed
jealous
smiled
to
himself
for
a
few
days
after
what
had
passed
there
was
a
happy
reaction
in
the
house
everyone
was
almost
unnaturally
sweet
and
polite
and
unselfish
about
trifles
to
everybody
else
edith
was
devoting
herself
to
the
children
bruce
had
less
of
her
society
than
usual
she
seemed
to
assume
they
were
to
be
like
brother
and
sister
he
would
at
present
raise
the
question
thinking
she
would
soon
get
over
such
a
rotten
idea
besides
a
great
many
people
had
left
town
and
they
were
themselves
in
the
rather
unsettled
state
of
intending
to
go
away
in
a
fortnight
though
happy
at
getting
off
so
easily
bruce
was
really
missing
the
meetings
and
notes
rather
than
the
girl
fortunately
vincy
now
returned
he
was
looking
sunburnt
and
happy
he
had
been
having
a
good
time
yet
he
looked
a
little
anxious
occasionally
as
if
perplexed
one
day
he
told
edith
that
he
had
just
had
a
rather
serious
quarrel
with
someone
who
was
awfully
cross
and
carried
on
like
anything
and
would
give
over
guess
who
she
is
what
does
she
want
you
to
do
wants
me
to
do
what
all
my
relations
are
always
bothering
me
to
do
said
vincy
with
a
different
person
to
marry
marry
her
i
suppose
shall
you
afraid
not
he
said
do
think
i
quite
can
you
think
it
would
be
rather
unkind
to
her
neither
of
them
had
mentioned
miss
argles
name
the
fact
that
vincy
referred
to
it
at
all
showed
her
that
he
had
recovered
from
his
infatuation
do
you
think
i
treating
the
poor
girl
badly
even
if
you
adored
her
it
would
end
unhappily
as
you
do
you
would
both
be
miserable
from
the
first
day
be
firm
be
nice
and
kind
to
her
and
tell
her
straight
out
and
come
and
stay
with
us
in
the
country
that
was
rather
my
idea
oh
but
edith
it
hard
to
hurt
anyone
know
i
saw
her
driving
with
aylmer
that
day
and
i
thought
he
liked
her
i
found
i
was
wrong
he
does
i
wish
i
could
get
some
nice
person
to
er
take
her
out
i
mean
take
her
on
sort
of
person
she
pretty
in
her
way
i
daresay
she
attract
someone

of
person
oh

do
know
some
nice
earl
would
please
her
or
one
of
those
artist
chaps
you
read
of
in
the
feuilletons
the
sort
of
artist
who
when
he
once
gets
a
tiny
little
picture
skied
at
the
academy
immediately
has
fortune
and
titles
and
things
rolling
in
a
little
picture
called
or
by
moonlight
or
something
of
that
sort
in
those
jolly
stories
means
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
at
once
jolly
is
it
vincy
dear
but
we
not
living
in
a
feuilleton
what
really
going
to
be
done
will
she
be
nasty
but
i
afraid
aunt
jessie
will
abuse
me
something
cruel
he
thought
a
little
while
fact
she
has
does
she
say
says
i
no
gentleman
she
said
i
had
no
business
to
lead
the
poor
girl
on
in
a
manner
of
speaking
and
walk
out
with
her
and
pay
her
marked
attention
and
then
not
propose
marriage
like
a
gentleman
you
rather
unhappy
just
now
vincy
i
spoke
to
frankly
and
said
i
would
like
to
go
on
being
her
friend
but
i
did
mean
to
marry
and
said
she
never
see
me
again
unless
i
did
what
else
about
all
thanks
very
much
said
vincy
here
bruce
came
in
he
said
have
you
asked
aylmer
to
come
and
stay
with
us
at
westgate
no
i
think
i
rather
not
on
earth
not
how
absurd
of
you
it
a
bit
selfish
dear
if
you
excuse
my
saying
so

all
very
well
for
you
you
got
the
children
and
vincy
to
amuse
you
you
coming

you
vincy
what
price
me
i
must
have
someone
else
who
can
go
for
walks
and
play
golf
a
real
pal
and
so
forth
i
need
exercise
and
intellectual
sympathy
aylmer
did
say
he
had
anywhere
else
to
go
going
to
take
his
boy
freddie
away
to
some
seaside
place
he
does
like
staying
with
people
right
then
i
shall
go
and
ask
him
to
come
and
stay
at
the
hotel
for
at
least
a
fortnight
i
shall
go
and
ask
him
now
inconsistent
edith
at
one
moment
you
seem
to
like
the
man
but
as
soon
as
i
want
to
make
a
pleasant
arrangement
you
off
it
so
like
a
woman
is
it
vincy
he
laughed
it
answered
vincy
look
here
i
going
right
down
to
jermyn
street
purposely
to
tell
him
i
be
back
to
dinner
do
stop
vincy
bruce
was
even
more
anxious
than
he
used
to
be
always
to
have
a
third
person
present
whenever
possible
he
walked
through
the
hot
july
streets
with
that
feeling
of
flatness
of
the
want
of
a
mild
excitement
apart
from
his
own
home
he
saw
aylmer
and
persuaded
him
to
come
while
he
was
there
a
rather
pretty
pale
girl
with
rough
red
hair
was
announced
aylmer
introduced
miss
argles
only
came
for
a
minute
to
bring
back
those
books
mr
ross
she
said
shyly
ca
stop
thank
you
so
much
said
aylmer
you
have
tea
nothing
i
go
at
i
only
brought
you
in
the
books
myself
to
show
you
they
were
safe
she
gave
a
slightly
coquettish
glance
at
aylmer
a
glance
at
bruce
sighed
heavily
and
went
away
she
was
dressed
in
green
serge
with
a
collar
of
black
lace
she
wore
black
suède
gloves
a
gold
bangle
and
a
smart
and
pretty
hat
the
hat
vincy
pretended
had
been
given
to
by
cissie
cavanack
his
entirely
imaginary
cousin
and
which
he
really
bought
for
her
in
bond
street
i
be
off
then
i
tell
edith
you
write
for
rooms
look
sharp
about
it
because
they
soon
go
at
the
best
hotels
any
rate
i
bring
freddie
down
for
a
week
said
aylmer
then
we
see
is
that
girl
asked
bruce
as
he
left
a
young
artist
and
i
lent
her
some
books
of
old
prints
she
wanted
she
not
a
particular
friend
of
mine
i
do
care
for
her
much
bruce
did
hear
the
last
words
for
he
was
flying
out
of
the
door
miss
argles
was
walking
very
slowly
he
joined
her
me
he
said
raising
his
hat
so
very
hot
am
i
going
your
way
would
you
allow
me
to
see
you
home
you
very
kind
i
sure
she
said
sadly
i
do
think
i
live
at
ravenscourt
park
bruce
thought
there
was
plenty
of
time
how
very
curious
that
just
where
i
was
going
said
he
boldly
he
put
up
his
stick
instead
of
a
taxi
a
hansom
drove
up
bruce
hailed
it
like
to
give
these
chaps
a
turn
when
i
can
he
said
it
would
take
longer
you
are
murmured
the
girl
i
really
rather
not
thank
you
how
shall
you
get
back
to
the
tube
no
it
far
too
hot
let
me
drop
you
as
i
going
in
your
direction
he
gave
her
a
rather
fixed
look
of
admiration
and
smiled
she
gave
a
slight
look
back
and
got
into
the
cab
ripping
red
hair
said
bruce
to
himself
as
he
followed
her
before
the
end
of
the
drive
which
for
him
was
a
sort
of
adventure
mavis
had
promised
to
meet
bruce
when
she
left
her
art
school
next
tuesday
at
a
certain
in
bond
street
bruce
went
home
happy
and
in
good
spirits
again
there
was
no
earthly
harm
in
being
kind
to
a
poor
little
girl
like
this
he
might
do
a
great
deal
of
good
she
seemed
to
admire
him
she
thought
him
so
clever
funny
thing
there
was
no
doubt
he
had
the
gift
women
liked
him
and
there
you
are
look
at
miss
mooney
at
the
mitchells
the
other
day
why
she
was
ever
so
nice
to
him
went
for
him
like
one
but
he
gave
her
no
encouragement
edith
was
there
he
would
worry
her
dear
girl
as
he
came
towards
home
he
smiled
again
and
edith
dear
edith
she
too
must
be
frightfully
keen
on
him
when
one
came
to
think
about
it
to
forgive
him
so
readily
about
margaret
tow
oh
confound
miss
townsend
this
girl
was
a
picture
a
sort
of
rossetti
and
she
had
had
such
trouble
lately
terrible
trouble
the
man
she
had
been
devoted
to
for
years
had
suddenly
thrown
her
over
heartlessly
what
a
brute
he
must
have
been
she
was
going
to
tell
him
all
about
it
on
tuesday
that
man
must
have
been
a
fiend
vincy
so
glad
you
still
here
let
have
dinner
edie
chapter
xxiii
at
lady
lady
everard
was
sitting
in
her
favourite
attitude
at
her
with
her
face
turned
to
the
door
she
had
once
been
photographed
at
her
with
a
curtain
behind
her
and
her
face
turned
to
the
door
the
photograph
had
appeared
in
queen
the
ladies
field
the
sketch
the
taller
the
bystander
home
chat
home
notes
the
woman
at
and
stately
homes
of
it
was
a
favourite
photograph
of
hers
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
it
and
therefore
she
always
liked
to
be
found
in
this
position
the
photo
had
been
called
everard
at
work
in
her
what
she
was
supposed
to
be
working
at
heaven
only
knew
for
she
never
wrote
a
line
of
anything
and
even
her
social
notes
and
invitation
cards
were
always
written
by
her
secretary
as
soon
as
a
visitor
came
in
she
rose
from
the
suspiciously
clean
put
down
the
dry
pen
on
a
spotless
blotter
went
and
sat
in
a
large
brocaded
in
front
of
some
palms
within
view
of
the
piano
and
began
to
talk
the
was
large
splendid
and
elaborately
decorated
there
was
a
frieze
all
round
representing
variously
coloured
and
somewhat
shapeless
creatures
playing
what
were
supposed
to
be
musical
instruments
one
in
a
short
blue
skirt
was
blowing
at
something
another
in
pink
drapery
who
squinted
was
strumming
on
a
lyre
other
figures
were
in
white
with
their
mouths
open
like
young
birds
preparing
to
be
fed
by
older
birds
they
represented
harmony
in
all
its
forms
there
were
other
attempts
at
the
classical
in
the
decoration
of
the
room
but
lady
everard
herself
had
reduced
this
idea
to
bathos
by
huge
quantities
of
signed
photographs
in
silver
frames
by
large
baskets
lined
with
blue
satin
and
trimmed
with
pink
rosettes
by
fans
which
were
pockets
stuffed
cats
which
were
paperweights
oranges
which
were
pincushions
and
other
debris
from
those
charitable
and
social
bazaars
of
which
she
was
a
constant
patroness
with
her
usual
curious
combination
of
weak
volubility
and
decided
of
the
law
she
was
preparing
to
hold
forth
to
young
la
france
whom
she
expected
on
the
subject
of
debussy
edvina
marcoux
the
appalling
singing
of
all
his
young
friends
his
own
good
looks
and
other
subjects
of
musical
interest
when
mr
cricker
was
announced
she
greeted
him
with
less
eagerness
if
less
patronage
than
her
other
protégé
but
graciously
offered
him
tea
and
permitted
a
cigarette
lady
everard
went
in
for
being
at
once
and
bohemian
she
was
truly
and
kind
except
to
rivals
in
her
own
sphere
but
when
jealous
she
was
rather
redoubtable
pleased
to
see
you
my
dear
willie
she
said
the
more
because
i
hear
mrs
mitchell
has
taken
wednesdays
now
not
a
nice
thing
to
do
i
think
although
after
all
i
suppose
we
could
hardly
really
clash
true
we
happen
to
know
a
few
of
the
same
people
by
that
lady
everard
meant
she
had
snatched
as
many
of
mrs
mitchell
friends
away
as
she
thought
desirable
as
a
general
rule
i
suppose
we
not
really
in
the
same
set
but
perhaps
going
on
there
afterwards
that
had
been
mr
clicker
intention
but
he
denied
it
with
surprise
and
apparent
pain
at
the
suspicion
she
settled
down
more
comfortably
well
mrs
mitchell
is
an
extremely
nice
hospitable
woman
and
her
parties
are
i
know
considered
amusing
but
i
do
think
i
really
do
that
her
husband
carries
his
practical
jokes
and
things
a
too
far
it
is
good
form
it
really
is
to
see
a
man
of
his
age
with
his
face
blacked
coming
in
after
dinner
with
a
banjo
calling
himself
the
musical
kaffir
as
he
did
the
last
time
i
was
there
i
find
it
that
the
word
he
seemed
to
think
that
we
were
all
children
at
a
juvenile
party
i
was
saying
so
to
lord
rye
only
last
night
lord
rye
likes
it
i
think
but
he
says
mr
mitchell
mad
that
what
it
is
a
little
mad
last
time
lord
rye
was
there
everybody
had
a
present
given
them
hidden
in
their
table
napkins
there
had
been
some
mistake
in
the
parcels
i
believe
and
miss
mooney
you
know
the
actress
myra
mooney
received
a
safety
razor
and
lord
rye
a
vanity
bag
everybody
screamed
with
laughter
but
i
must
say
it
seemed
to
me
rather
silly
i
was
there
myself
was
said
mr
cricker
got
a
very
pretty
little
feather
fan
i
suppose
the
things
really
had
been
mixed
up
and
after
all
i
was
very
glad
of
the
fan
i
was
able
to
give
it
to
he
stopped
sighed
and
looked
down
on
the
floor
is
that
affair
still
going
on
willie
dear
it
seems
to
me
a
pity
i
wish
you
would
try
and
give
it
up
know
but
she
he
said
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
anxiety
lady
everard
you
a
woman
of
the
world
and
know
everything
she
smiled
everything
willie
a
little
of
music
perhaps
i
know
a
good
voice
when
i
hear
it
i
have
a
certain
for
what
going
to
be
a
success
in
that
direction
and
of
course
i
been
everywhere
and
seen
everything
i
a
certain
natural
knowledge
of
life
too
and
keep
well
up
to
date
with
everything
that
going
on
i
knew
about
the
hendon
divorce
case
long
before
anyone
else
though
it
never
came
off
after
all
but
that
not
the
point
but
then
i
so
discreet
people
tell
me
things
at
any
rate
i
always
indeed
lady
everard
firmly
believed
herself
to
be
a
great
authority
on
most
subjects
but
especially
on
contemporary
gossip
this
was
a
delusion
in
reality
she
had
that
marvellous
talent
for
not
knowing
things
that
gift
for
ignorance
and
genius
for
inaccuracy
so
frequently
seen
in
that
cultured
section
of
society
of
which
she
was
so
popular
and
distinguished
a
member
it
is
a
talent
that
rarely
fails
to
please
particularly
in
a
case
like
her
own
there
is
always
a
certain
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
a
woman
of
position
and
wealth
who
plumes
herself
on
her
early
knowledge
and
special
information
is
absolutely
and
entirely
devoid
of
the
one
and
incorrect
in
the
other
a
marked
ignorance
in
a
professionally
person
has
always
something
touching
and
appealing
to
those
who
are
able
if
not
willing
to
set
that
person
right
it
was
taken
for
granted
among
her
acquaintances
and
probably
was
one
of
the
qualities
that
endeared
her
to
them
most
that
dear
lady
everard
was
generally
positive
and
always
wrong
i
do
know
most
things
perhaps
she
said
complacently
one
thing
i
know
is
that
this
woman
friend
of
yours
is
making
you
perfectly
miserable
you
longing
to
shake
it
off
ah
i
know
you
you
far
more
real
happiness
in
going
to
the
opera
with
me
than
even
in
seeing
her
and
the
more
she
pursues
you
the
less
you
like
it
am
i
not
right
i
suppose
so
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
lady
everard
if
she
did
well
what
you
might
call
make
a
dash
for
it
i
should
worry
about
her
at
all
continued
lady
everard
not
listening
like
coldness
coldness
reserve
the
only
way
in
the
world
to
draw
a
man
on
is
to
be
always
out
to
him
or
to
go
away
and
never
even
let
him
hear
your
name
mentioned
daresay
there
a
lot
in
that
said
cricker
wondering
why
she
did
not
try
that
plan
with
young
la
france
of
the
present
day
she
continued
growing
animated
such
a
terrible
terrible
mistake
i
what
do
they
do
when
they
like
a
young
man
oh
i
know
they
write
to
him
at
his
club
they
call
at
his
rooms
and
leave
messages
they
telephone
whenever
they
can
the
more
he
does
answer
their
invitations
the
more
they
invite
him
appalling
and
what
the
result
men
are
becoming
cooler
and
cooler
as
a
class
i
mean
of
course
there
are
exceptions
but
it
such
a
mistake
of
women
to
run
after
the
few
young
men
there
are
there
are
such
a
tremendous
lot
of
girls
and
married
women
nowadays
there
are
so
many
more
of
them
perhaps
that
why
they
do
it
said
cricker
rather
stupidly
any
rate
oh
well
i
know
if
my
friend
had
been
so
jolly
nice
to
me
at
first
and
kept
it
up
so
oh
well
you
know
what
i
mean
kept
on
keeping
on
if
i
may
use
the
expression
i
should
have
drifted
away
from
her
ages
ago
because
you
see
supposing
i
beginning
to
think
about
something
else
or
somebody
else
she
does
stand
it
she
stand
it
and
the
awkward
part
is
you
see
her
being
the
stage
married
makes
the
whole
thing
about
as
awkward
as
a
case
of
that
sort
can
possibly
be
would
not
ask
you
her
name
for
the
world
said
lady
everard
smoothly
course
i
know
she
a
beautiful
young
comedy
actress
or
is
it
tragedy
i
wonder
if
i
could
guess
her
first
name
will
you
tell
me
if
i
guess
right
she
looked
arch
i
say
i
ca
tell
you
who
it
is
lady
everard
really
not
the
first
name
i
do
you
to
tell
me
i
discretion
itself
i
prefer
not
to
know
the
christian
name
is
not
margaretta
is
it
ah
no
i
thought
not
it
irene
pettifer
there
i
guessed
the
fact
is
i
always
knew
it
my
dear
boy
your
secret
is
safe
with
me
i
the
tomb
i
me
lady
everard
said
cricker
with
every
sign
of
annoyance
no
more
irene
pettifer
than
it
you
yourself
please
believe
me
first
of
all
i
do
irene
pettifer
i
never
even
seen
her
photograph
she
not
young
not
married
and
an
entirely
different
sort
of
person
did
i
tell
you
i
knew
it
was
i
only
said
that
to
draw
you
however
have
a
little
more
tea
or
some
iced
coffee
it
so
much
more
refreshing
i
always
think
my
dear
willie
i
was
only
chaffing
you
i
knew
perfectly
well
it
was
either
of
the
people
i
suggested
the
point
is
it
seems
to
prey
on
your
mind
and
worry
you
and
you
break
it
off
how
can
i
will
dictate
you
a
letter
she
said
be
it
from
me
to
interfere
and
i
do
pretend
to
know
more
about
this
sort
of
thing
than
anybody
else
at
the
same
time
if
you
take
it
down
just
as
i
tell
it
and
send
it
off
you
find
it
will
do
admirably
have
you
got
a
pencil
as
if
dully
hypnotised
he
took
out
a
pencil
and
notebook
would
be
awfully
kind
of
you
lady
everard
it
might
give
me
an
idea
anyway
right
she
leant
back
and
half
closed
her
eyes
as
if
in
thought
then
started
up
with
one
finger
out
must
be
quick
because
i
expecting
someone
presently
she
said
we
got
time
for
this
now
begin
july
have
you
got
that
i
got
that
perhaps
just
thursday
thursday
looks
more
casual
more
full
of
feeling
than
the
exact
date
got
thursday
but
it
is
thursday
it
friday
right
friday
or
any
day
you
like
the
day
is
not
the
point
you
can
send
it
tomorrow
or
any
time
you
like
wednesday
my
dearest
irene
name
not
irene
no
i
forgot
take
that
out
dear
margaretta
circumstances
have
occurred
since
i
last
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
that
make
it
absolutely
impossible
that
i
could
ever
meet
you
again
i
say
on
ever
see
you
or
meet
you
again
you
wish
to
be
kind
to
her
i
suppose
yes
say
duty
has
to
come
between
us
but
god
knows
i
wish
you
well
tears
were
beginning
to
come
to
lady
everard
eyes
and
she
spoke
with
a
break
in
her
voice
wish
you
well
irene
not
irene
wish
you
well
margaretta
some
day
in
the
far
distant
future
think
of
me
and
be
thankful
for
what
i
have
done
it
for
your
good
and
my
own
happiness
that
we
part
now
and
for
ever
adieu
and
may
god
bless
you
how
do
you
sign
yourself
willie
well
then
be
more
serious
this
time
always
your
faithful
friend
william
stacey
cricker
he
glanced
over
the
note
his
face
falling
more
and
more
while
lady
everard
looked
more
and
more
satisfied
that
out
word
for
word
the
moment
you
go
back
and
send
it
off
she
said
all
the
worst
of
your
troubles
will
be
over
should
think
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
said
he
ruefully
you
promise
to
do
it
willie
oh
promise
me
yes
rather
said
he
for
word
lord
yes
that
to
say
unless
anything
a
word
willie
it
will
be
your
salvation
come
and
see
me
soon
and
tell
me
the
result
ah
here
you
are
cher
maître
with
a
bright
smile
she
welcomed
mr
la
france
who
was
now
announced
gently
dismissing
willie
with
a
push
of
the
left
hand
heavens
he
said
to
himself
as
he
got
into
the
cab
if
i
were
to
send
a
thing
like
that
there
would
be
murder
and
suicide
show
it
to
her
husband
and
he
come
round
and
knock
me
into
a
cocked
hat
for
it
dear
lady
everard
she
a
dear
but
she
does
know
anything
about
anything
he
tore
the
pages
out
of
his
and
called
out
to
the
cabman
the
address
of
the
mitchells
chère
madame
que
je
suis
fatigué
exclaimed
la
france
as
he
threw
himself
back
against
the
cushions
his
hair
was
long
and
smooth
and
fair
so
fair
that
he
had
been
spoken
of
by
jealous
singers
as
a
peroxide
blond
his
eyes
were
greenish
and
he
had
dark
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
he
was
his
voice
in
speaking
was
harsh
but
his
manner
soft
and
insidious
his
talents
were
cosmopolitan
his
tastes
international
he
had
no
duties
few
pleasures
and
that
entire
want
of
leisure
known
only
to
those
who
have
practically
nothing
whatever
to
do
that
what
you
always
say
said
lady
everard
laughing
it
is
always
true
he
said
with
a
strong
french
accent
should
take
more
exercise
paul
go
out
more
in
the
air
you
lead
too
secluded
a
life
exercises
i
practise
my
voice
every
day
twenty
minutes
but
i
did
mean
that
i
mean
in
the
open
air
sport
that
sort
of
thing
you
wish
i
go
horseback
riding
ver
nice
but
not
for
me
i
have
never
did
it
i
can
not
begun
now
lady
everard
i
spoil
all
the
of
my
voice
have
you
seen
again
that
pretty
little
lady
i
met
here
before
delicious
light
brown
hair
pretty
blue
eyes
a
wonderful
blue
a
blue
that
seem
to
say
to
everyone
something
different
exclaimed
lady
everard
you
referring
to
mrs
ottley
she
calmed
down
again
yes
she
charming
awfully
sweet
devoted
to
her
husband
you
know
absolutely
devoted
to
her
husband
so
rare
and
delightful
nowadays
in
london
yes
ver
nice
me
i
am
devoted
to
husband
too
i
go
to
see
him
he
ask
me
without
exclaimed
lady
everard
meet
him
the
other
night
he
ask
me
to
come
round
and
sing
him
a
song
i
can
not
ask
if
i
may
bring
lady
everard
in
my
pocket
paul
i
do
think
that
quite
a
nice
joke
to
make
i
must
say
then
relenting
she
said
know
it
only
your
artistic
fun
she
ver
devoted
to
him
he
have
great
confidence
in
her
he
trust
her
quite
he
sure
she
never
have
any
flirt
has
every
confidence
he
certain
absolutely
certain
exclaimed
lady
everard
wait
till
she
come
and
tell
him
i
suppose
is
right
he
continued
in
this
strain
for
some
time
constantly
going
back
to
his
admiration
for
edith
and
then
began
with
a
good
deal
of
bitterness
on
the
subject
of
another
young
singer
whom
he
declared
to
be
garçon
but
no
good
could
not
sing
for
nuts
she
heartily
agreed
and
they
began
to
get
on
beautifully
again
when
she
suddenly
said
to
him
it
true
you
were
seen
talking
in
the
park
to
that
girl
miss
turnbull
on
sunday
you
say
i
was
seen
i
was
you
could
not
know
i
talk
to
her
unless
i
was
seen
you
could
not
know
by
wireless
talk
nonsense
paul
she
answered
sharply
point
that
you
were
seen
but
that
you
did
it
did
it
me
i
did
do
anything
do
think
it
fair
to
me
i
must
say
it
hurt
my
feelings
that
you
should
meet
amy
turnbull
in
the
park
and
talk
to
her
what
could
i
say
it
is
ver
difficul
i
walk
through
the
park
she
walk
through
it
with
another
lady
she
speak
to
me
she
say
ah
dear
mr
la
france
what
pleasure
to
see
you
i
ask
you
lady
everard
could
i
a
foreigner
not
even
naturalised
here
could
i
order
her
out
of
the
park
could
i
scream
out
to
her
go
out
do
not
walk
in
ze
hyde
park
lady
everard
do
not
like
you
i
have
no
authority
to
say
that
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
persons
that
walk
in
their
own
park
in
their
own
country
she
might
answer
me
to
go
to
the
devil
she
might
say
to
me
what
lady
everard
not
like
me
so
i
am
not
allowed
in
the
park
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
in
a
case
like
this
chère
madame
i
have
no
legal
power
she
laughed
forgivingly
and
said
well
one
must
be
too
exacting
and
as
she
showed
some
signs
of
a
desire
to
pat
his
hair
he
rose
sat
down
to
the
piano
greatly
to
her
disappointment
and
filled
up
the
rest
of
the
time
by
improvising
from
memory
it
was
a
little
fatiguing
as
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
keep
up
an
expression
of
acute
rapture
during
the
whole
of
the
performance
which
lasted
at
least
of
an
hour
chapter
xxiv
miss
bennett
since
his
return
aylmer
saw
everything
through
what
he
called
a
microscope
that
is
to
say
every
detail
of
his
life
and
everything
connected
with
it
seemed
to
him
perfect
he
saw
edith
as
much
as
ever
and
far
less
formally
than
before
she
treated
him
with
affectionate
ease
she
had
admitted
by
her
behaviour
on
the
night
he
returned
that
she
cared
for
him
and
for
the
moment
that
was
enough
a
sort
of
general
relaxation
of
formality
due
to
the
waning
of
the
season
and
to
people
being
too
busy
to
bother
or
already
in
thought
away
seemed
to
give
a
greater
freedom
everyone
seemed
more
natural
and
more
satisfied
to
follow
their
own
inclinations
and
let
other
people
follow
theirs
london
was
getting
stale
and
tired
and
the
last
feverish
flickers
of
the
exhausted
season
alternated
with
a
kind
of
languor
in
which
nobody
bothered
much
about
anybody
else
affairs
general
interest
was
exhausted
and
only
a
strong
sense
of
seemed
to
be
left
people
clung
desperately
to
their
last
hopes
edith
was
curiously
peaceful
and
contented
she
would
have
had
scarcely
any
leisure
but
that
her
sometimes
relieved
her
of
the
care
of
the
children
being
very
anxious
that
they
should
not
lose
anything
from
miss
townsend
absence
she
gave
them
lessons
every
day
one
day
at
the
end
of
a
history
lesson
archie
said
miss
townsend
at
bexhill

bexhill

townsend

she
not
our
miss
townsend
any
more
why
is
she
gone
away
she
coming
back
watching
his
mother
face
he
realised
that
she
did
regret
this
so
he
said
miss
townsend
teaching
anybody
else
daresay
she
is
or
she
will
perhaps
are
their
names
should
i
know
you
think

archie
possible
wonder
if

very
kind
to
you

edith

archie

than
miss
townsend

of
her
i

edith

archie
putting
his
arm
round
her
neck
not
angry

fun

she
brings
parcels
because
i
ask
her
to
do
shopping
for
me
it
very
kind
of
her
she
waited
a
minute
then
he
said
do

me

bennett
brings
the
parcels

very
useful
i
can
untie
parcels
with
my
teeth

this
look
i
throw
myself
on
the
parcel
just
like
a
dog
and
shake
it
and
shake
it
and
then
i
untie
it
with
my
teeth
it
would
be
awfully
useful
she
refused
the
kind
offer
miss
bennett
arrived
as
usual
with
the
parcels
looking
pleasantly
and
important
wonder
if
these
things
will
do
she
said
as
she
put
them
out
on
the
table
they
sure
to
do
said
edith
perfect
dear
wait
till
you
see
them

do
think

much
interest

a
mechanical
railway

edith

more
interest
she

them
white

black
velvet
in
the

to
do

going
to
the
academy
with
me
and
aylmer
he
coming
to
fetch
us
really
what
fun
at
this
moment
he
arrived
edith
introduced
them
been
having
such
a
morning
shopping
she
said
deserve
a
little
treat
afterwards
do
i
sort
of
shopping
i
tell
you
what
you
ought
to
have
a
great
cricket
match
when
the
shopping
season
over
between
the
old
selfridgians
and
the
old
harrodians
he
said
laughing
they
walked
through
acres
of
oil
paintings
and
dozens
of
portraits
of
chief
justices
ca
imagine
anyone
but
royalty
enjoying
these
pictures
said
edith
do
go
to
see
pictures
they
go
to
view
exhibits
aylmer
answered
declaring
they
had
headache
before
they
had
been
through
the
second
room
they
sat
down
and
watched
the
people
one
sees
people
there
that
are
to
be
seen
nowhere
else
an
extraordinary
large
number
of
clergymen
a
peculiar
kind
of
provincial
and
strange
londoners
almost
impossible
to
place
in
surprising
clothes
then
they
gave
it
up
and
aylmer
took
them
out
to
lunch
at
a
club
almost
as
huge
and
noisy
and
as
miscellaneous
as
the
academy
itself
however
they
thoroughly
enjoyed
themselves
edith
and
bruce
were
to
take
up
their
abode
in
their
little
country
house
at
westgate
next
day
chapter
xxv
at
westgate
got
to
go
up
to
town
on
special
business
said
bruce
one
afternoon
after
receiving
a
telegram
which
he
had
rather
ostentatiously
left
about
hoping
he
would
be
questioned
on
the
subject
it
had
however
been
persistently
disregarded
have
you
look
at
this
wire
he
read
aloud
to
see
you
at
once
if
possible
come
up
today
of
course
who
should
it
be
he
spoke
aggressively
then
softened
down
to
explanation
in
town
a
few
days
on
business
too
i
may
be
detained
till
tuesday
or
even
wednesday
next
bruce
had
been
to
town
so
often
lately
his
manner
was
so
vague
he
seemed
at
once
so
happy
and
so
preoccupied
so
excited
so
pleased
so
worried
and
yet
so
unnaturally
that
edith
had
begun
to
suspect
he
was
seeing
miss
townsend
again
the
suspicion
hurt
her
for
he
had
given
his
word
of
honour
and
had
been
nice
to
her
ever
since
and
amiable
though
rather
absent
and
bored
with
the
children
she
walked
down
to
the
station
with
him
though
he
wished
to
go
in
the
cab
which
took
his
box
and
but
he
did
not
resist
her
wish
on
the
way
he
said
looking
round
as
if
he
had
only
just
arrived
and
had
never
seen
it
before
is
a
very
nice
little
place
it
just
the
right
place
for
you
and
the
children
if
i
were
you
i
should
stay
on
here
it
struck
her
he
spoke
in
a
very
detached
way
and
some
odd
foreshadowing
came
to
her
are
you
coming
back
she
asked
jokingly
an
idea
yes
of
course
but
i
told
you
this
business
of
mine
well
it
take
a
little
time
to
arrange
still
i
expect
to
be

wednesday
or
sooner
they
walked
on
and
had
nearly
reached
the
station

you
angry
with

for

his
boy
at
the
hotel

mother
and
vincy

plenty
of
companions
i
do
suppose
you
miss
me
much
you
see
a
this
is
a
sort
of
business
matter
women
do
understand
women
are
incapable
of
understanding
it
what
nature
is
it
do
you
mean
nature
it
not
of
any
particular
nature
indeed
how
like
a
woman
it
just
business
he
waited
a
minute
that
what
it
is
yes
it
stockbroking
i
want
to
see
a
chap
who
put
me
in
to
a
good
thing
a
perfectly
safe
thing
no
gambling
but
one
has
to
see
into
it
you
see
mitchell
wants
to
see
me
at
once
you
see
do
you
see
you
saw
his
wire
did
you
explained
have
i
are
you
satisfied
with
my
explanation
appear
to
be
very
but
i
not
asking
you
to
tell
me
any
details
about
the
business
whatever
it
may
be
they
arrived
at
the
station
and
bruce
gave
her
what
she
thought
a
very
queer
look
it
was
a
mixture
of
fear
daring
caution
and
a
sort
of
bravado
anxiety
was
in
it
as
well
as
a
pleased
me
frankly
something
i
like
to
know
bruce
you
getting
suspicious
of
me
edith
that
not
like
you
mind
you
it
a
great
mistake
in
a
woman
women
should
always
trust
mistrust
sometimes
drives
a
man
to
to
oh
anyhow
it
a
great
mistake
only
want
you
to
tell
me
something
bruce
i
believe
you
implicitly
if
you
answer
do
you
ever
see
miss
townsend
now
on
my
honour
i
swear
it
he
spoke
with
such
genuine
good
faith
that
she
believed
him
at
once
i
glad
and
have
you
never
since
seen
her
never
written
to
her
never
communicated
with
her
since
she
left
do
know
where
she
is
and
do
care
now
you
do
believe
me
he
asked
with
all
the
earnestness
and
energy
of
truth
forgive
me
for
asking
that
all
right
he
was
relieved
and
smiled
right
bruce
dear
i
glad
it
would
have
worried
me
go
edith
do
bother
to
wait
till
i
get
in
i
write
to
you
i
write
to
you
soon
she
still
lingered
seeing
something
odd
in
his
manner
my
love
to
my
mother
he
said
looking
away
say
edith
dear
nothing
she
waited
on
till
the
train
started
his
manner
was
alternately
peevish
and
kind
but
altogether
odd
her
last
glimpse
was
a
rather
pale
smile
from
bruce
as
he
waved
his
hand
and
then
turned
to
his
paper
what
it
matter
so
long
as
he
gone
exclaimed
aylmer
impatiently
when
she
expressed
her
wonder
at
bruce
going
the
tide
was
low
and
they
went
for
a
long
walk
over
the
hard
shining
sand
followed
by
archie
picking
up
wonderful
shells
and
slipping
on
the
green
seaweed
everything
seemed
fresh
lovely
she
herself
was
as
fresh
as
the
sea
breeze
and
aylmer
seemed
to
her
as
strong
as
the
sea
privately
edith
thought
him
irresistible
in
country
clothes
edith
had
everything
here
to
make
her
happy
including
bruce
mother
who
relieved
her
of
the
children
when
she
wanted
rest
and
in
whose
eyes
she
was
perfection
she
saw
restrained
adoration
in
aylmer
eyes
love
and
trust
in
the
eyes
of
the
children
she
had
all
she
wanted
and
yet
something
tugged
at
her
heart
and
worried
her
she
had
a
strange
and
melancholy
presentiment
but
she
threw
it
off
probably
there
was
nothing
really
wrong
with
bruce
perhaps
only
one
of
those
little
imaginary
romances
that
he
liked
to
fabricate
for
himself
or
perhaps
it
was
really
business
it
was
all
right
if
mr
mitchell
knew
about
it
yet
she
could
not
believe
that
mitchell
bruce
had
repeated
it
too
often
and
why
on
earth
should
mitchell
suddenly
take
to
sending
bruce
fantastic
telegrams
and
signing
them
for
no
reason
with
an
initial
chapter
xxvi
goggles
divine
heavenly
pets
and
ducks
of
angels
they
are
exclaimed
lady
everard
rather
distractedly
divine
and
so
good
too
i
never
saw
such
darlings
in
my
life
look
at
them
paul
are
they
sweet
lady
everard
with
her
party
what
aylmer
called
her
performing
troupe
had
driven
over
to
westgate
from
where
she
was
staying
in
the
neighbourhood
to
have
tea
with
edith
she
had
brought
with
her
a
sort
of
juvenile
party
consisting
of
mr
cricker
captain
willis
and
of
course
paul
la
france
the
young
singer
she
never
moved
without
him
she
explained
that
two
other
women
had
been
coming
also
but
they
had
deserted
her
at
the
last
minute
paul
la
france
had
been
trying
for
an
hour
and
a
half
to
make
eyes
through
motor
goggles
which
naturally
was
not
a
success
so
he
seemed
a
little
out
of
temper
archie
was
staring
at
him
as
if
fascinated
he
went
up
and
said
lend
me
your
goggles
certainement
of
course
i
will
voilà
mon
petit
darling
how
sweet
and
amusing
of
him
but
they
only
to
be
used
in
the
motor
you
know
do
break
them
darling
will
you
monsieur
will
want
them
again
ah
how
sweet
he
looks
as
he
put
them
on
never

a
darling
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
look
at
him
mrs
ottley

fair
head

the
delight
of
dilly

that

it
extraordinary

my
little
grandchildren

yet
i
simply

asked
archie
in
his
persistent
way
as
he
walked
round
the
group
on
the
lawn
in
goggles
followed
closely
by
dilly
saying
what
is
he
looking
exactly
like
a
live
doll
with
her
golden
hair
and
blue
ribbons
a
motorist

silly
motorist

dilly

with
his
loud
laugh
mrs
ottley
but

it

to

under

chair
he
a

repeated
dilly

little
aside

she
slowly

away
calling
out

a
silly
mangle
in
a
very
irritating
tone
archie
made
a
tremendous
effort
to
ignore
her
then
he
ran
after
her
saying
you

aylmer
seized

wire

ring
and
letters
by
every
post

thought
it

a
good
plan
to

for
a
bit
but
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
go
back
fancy
she
threatened
suicide
and
telling
her
husband
and
confiding
in
lady
everard
and
giving
up
the
stage
and
oh
goodness
knows
what
there
no
doubt
the
poor
child
is
absolutely
raving
about
me
no
doubt
whatever
aylmer
was
as
sympathetic
as
he
knew
how
the
party
was
just
going
off
when
la
france
found
that
the
goggles
had
disappeared
a
was
organised
great
excitement
prevailed
but
in
the
end
they
went
away
without
the
glasses
when
dilly
had
just
gone
to
sleep
in
her
cot
a
frightening
figure
crept
into
her
room
and
turned
on
the
electric
light
archie
what

it
who
is
it
oh
oh

frightened
said
archie
in
his
deepest
voice
obviously
hoping
she
would
be
frightened
he

in
pyjamas
and

frightened

what
i
what

i
mandrill
she
whined

goggles
and
kissed

chapter
xxvii
the
elopement
the
following
tuesday
edith
aylmer
vincy
and
mrs
ottley
were
sitting
on
the
veranda
after
dinner
they
had
a
charming
little
veranda
which
led
on
to
a
lawn
and
from
there
straight
down
to
the
sea
it
was
their
custom
to
sit
there
in
the
evening
and
talk
the
elder
mrs
ottley
enjoyed
these
evenings
and
the
most
modern
conversation
never
seemed
to
startle
her
she
would
listen
impassively
or
with
a
smile
as
if
in
silent
approval
to
the
most
monstrous
of
paradoxes
or
the
most
childish
chaff
aylmer
attention
and
kind
thought
for
her
had
absolutely
won
her
heart
she
consulted
him
about
everything
and
was
only
thoroughly
satisfied
when
he
was
there
his
strong
kind
decided
voice
his
good
looks
his
decision
and
a
sort
of
responsible
impulsiveness
all
appealed
to
her
immensely
she
looked
up
to
him
in
a
kind
of
admiring
maternal
way
edith
often
wondered
did
she
not
see
aylmer
devotion
but
if
she
did
mrs
ottley
thought
nothing
of
it
her
opinion
of
edith
was
so
high
that
she
trusted
her
in
any
complications
bruce
coming
down
tonight
she
asked
edith
to
have
a
wire
here
the
last
post
perhaps
he
written
instead
vincy
fetched
the
letters
there
was
one
from
bruce
edith
went
into
the
to
read
it
there
was
not
sufficient
light
on
the
veranda
in
growing
amazement
she
read
the
following
words
dear
edith
hope
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
will
not
worry
you
too
much
at
any
rate
i
do
hope
you
will
not
allow
it
to
affect
your
health
it
is
inevitable
and
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
it
as
soon
as
possible
i
say
this
in
no
spirit
of
unkindness
far
from
it
it
is
hard
to
me
to
break
the
news
to
you
but
it
must
be
done
argles
and
i
are
all
in
all
to
each
other

have
made
up
our
minds
on
account
of

to
throw
in
our
lot
together
and
we
are
starting
for
australia
today
when
this
reaches
you
we
shall
have
started
i
enclose
the
address
to
write
to

this
step
i
have
i
am
sure

for
the
best
it
may
cause
you
great
surprise
and
pain
i
regret
it
but
we
met
and
became
very
quickly
devoted
to
one
another
she
can
not
live
without
me
what
i
am
doing
is
my
duty
i
now
ask
you
and
believe
you
will
grant
my
request
to
make
arrangements
to
me
my
freedom
as
soon
as
mind
you
do
this
edith
for
it
is
really
my
duty
to
give
my
name
to
mavis
who
as
i
have
said
is
devoted
to
me
heart
and
soul
and
can
not
live
without
me
shall
always
have
the
greatest
regard
and
respect
for
you
and
you
am
sorry
also
about
my
mother
but
you
must
try
and
explain
that
it
is
for
the
best
you
also
will
know
exactly
what
to
do
and
how
to
bring
up
the
children
just
as
well
without
me
as
with
this
sudden
news
will
not
affect
your
health
in
any
way
and
that
you
will
try
and
stay
on
a
good
while
at
westgate
as
i
am
sure
the
air
is
doing
you
good
believe
me
yours
affectionately
as
always

you
do
forget
to
divorce

as
soon
as

will
give
you
all
the
advice
you
need
do
think
badly
of
me
i
have
meant
well
try
and
cheer
up
i
am
sorry
not
to
write
more
fully
but
you
can
imagine
how
i
was
rushed
to
catch
steamer
she
sat
alone
gazing
at
the
letter
under
the
light
she
was
divided
at
first
between
a
desire
to
laugh
and
cry
bruce
had
actually
eloped
his
silly
weakness
had
culminated
his
vanity
had
been
got
hold
of
horrid
little
had
positively
led
him
into
running
away
and
leaving
his
wife
and
children
controlling
herself
edith
went
to
the
veranda
and
said
to
mrs
ottley
that
bruce
was
coming
back
for
a
day
or
two
that
she
had
neuralgia
and
was
going
to
retire
but
begged
aylmer
not
to
go
yet
of
course
at
this
he
went
at
once
the
next
morning
aylmer
at
his
hotel
received
a
little
note
asking
him
to
come
round
and
see
edith
while
the
others
were
out
it
was
there
in
the
cool
shady
room
that
edith
showed
him
the
letter
god
he
exclaimed
looking
simply
wild
with
joy
is
too
marvellous
too
heavenly
do
you
realise
it
edith
do
you
see
he
wants
you
to
make
him
free
you
will
be
my
wife
settled
that
fixed
up
he
looked
at
her
in
delight
almost
too
great
for
expression
edith
knew
she
was
going
to
have
a
hard
task
now
she
was
pale
but
looked
completely
composed
she
said
wrong
aylmer
i
not
going
to
set
him
free
he
almost
shouted
you
mad
what
stick
to
him
when
he
does
want
you
ruin
the
wretched
girl
life
remains
to
be
seen
i
do
believe
everything
in
the
letter
the
children
he
exclaimed
when
he
does
the
children
when
he
deserts
them
is
their
father
father
then
if
you
were
married
to
a
criminal
who
implored
you
to
divorce
him
you
would
because
he
was
their
father
is
not
a
criminal
he
is
not
bad
he
is
a
fool
he
has
behaved
idiotically
and
i
can
never
care
for
him
in
the
way
i
used
to
but
i
mean
to
give
him
a
chance
i
not
going
to
jump
at
his
first
real
folly
to
get
rid
of
him
poor
bruce
she
laughed
aylmer
threw
himself
down
in
an
staring
at
her
amaze
me
he
said
amaze
me
you
not
human
do
you
adore
this
man
that
you
forgive
him
everything
you
do
even
seem
angry
do
adore
him
that
is
why
i
not
so
very
angry
i
was
terribly
hurt
about
miss
townsend
my
pride
my
trust
were
hurt
but
after
that
i
ca
ever
feel
that
personal
jealousy
any
more
what
i
have
got
to
think
of
is
what
is
best
you
do
care
for
me
i
better
go
away
he
turned
away
he
had
tears
in
his
eyes
do
aylmer
you
know
i
do
then
it
all
right
fate
seems
to
have
arranged
this
on
purpose
for
us
do
you
know
dear
how
i
be
good
to
the
children
how
i
do
anything
on
this
earth
for
them
why
i
reconcile
mrs
ottley
to
it
in
ten
minutes
i
do
he
started
up
not
going
to
let
mrs
ottley
know
anything
about
it
for
the
present
not
going
to
tell
her
i
shall
invent
a
story
to
account
for
his
absence
need
know
but
of
course
if
later
i
mean
if
he
persists
edith
do
be
a
fool
you
throwing
away
our
happiness
when
you
got
it
in
your
hand
are
some
things
that
one
do
said
edith
goes
against
the
grain
i
ca
take
advantage
of
his
folly
to
make
the
path
smoother
for
myself
what
will
become
of
him
when
they
quarrel
all
nonsense
bruce
is
only
weak
he
a
very
good
fellow
really
he
has
no
spirit
and
not
much
intellect
but
with
us
to
look
after
him
she
unconsciously
said
us
and
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
absurdity
of
it
he
will
get
along
all
right
yet
you
beyond
me
said
aylmer
give
up
understanding
you
she
stood
up
again
and
looked
out
of
the
window
him
have
his
silly
holiday
and
his
elopement
and
his
trip
he
thinks
it
will
make
a
terrific
sensation
and
i
hope
she
will
be
seasick
i
sure
she
will
she
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
and
then
after
you
take
him
back
you
have
no
pride
edith
she
turned
round
him
back
yes
officially
he
has
a
right
to
live
in
his
own
house
with
his
own
children
why
ever
since
i
found
out
about
miss
townsend
i
sure
i
was
nice
to
him
but
only
like
a
sister
yes
i
feel
just
like
a
sister
to
him
now
good
god
i
have
patience
with
all
this
nonsense
brotherly
husbands
who
run
away
with
other
girls
and
beg
you
to
divorce
them
sisterly
wives
who
forgive
them
and
stick
to
them
against
their
will
he
suddenly
stopped
and
held
out
his
hand
me
edith
i
believe
whatever
you
say
is
right
will
you
forgive
me
see
it
chiefly
on
account
of
the
children
if
it
were
for
them
i
take
advantage
of
this
to
be
happy
with
you
at
least
no
i
not
sure
that
i
would
not
if
i
thought
it
would
be
bruce
ruin
you
do
think
i
be
good
to
the
children
i
know
you
would
be
an
angel
to
them
but
what
the
use
i
tell
you
i
ca
do
it
wo
tease
you
i
wo
worry
you
any
more
he
said
in
a
rather
broken
voice
any
rate
think
what
a
terrible
blow
this
is
to
me
you
show
me
the
chance
of
heaven
then
you
voluntarily
dash
it
away
do
you
think
you
ought
to
consult
someone
you
have
asked
have
consulted
she
said
with
a
slight
smile
take
no
notice
of
what
i
say
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
wish
to
consult
anyone
i
have
made
my
own
decision
i
have
written
my
letter
she
took
it
out
of
her
bag
it
was
directed
to
bruce
at
the
address
he
had
given
her
in
australia
suppose
you
wo
let
me
read
it
he
said
sadly
think
i
rather
not
she
said
terribly
hurt
he
turned
to
the
door
no
you
shall
read
it
she
exclaimed
do
say
anything
make
no
remark
about
it
you
shall
read
it
because
i
trust
you
because
i
really
care
for
you
i
ought
to
he
said
dear
keep
it
to
yourself
his
delicacy
had
revived
and
he
was
ashamed
of
his
jealousy
but
now
she
insisted
on
showing
it
to
him
and
he
read
bruce
not
going
to
make
any
appeal
to
your
feelings
with
regard
to
your
mother
and
the
children
because
if
you
had
thought
even
of
me
a
little
this
would
not
have
happened
i
very
very
sorry
for
it
i
believe
it
happened
from
your
weakness
and
foolishness
or
you
could
not
have
behaved
with
such
irresponsibility
but
i
trying
to
look
at
it
quite
calmly
i
therefore
propose
to
do
nothing
at
all
for
three
months
if
i
acted
on
your
suggestion
you
might
regret
it
ever
after
if
in
three
months
you
write
to
me
again
in
the
same
strain
still
desiring
to
be
free
i
will
think
of
it
though
i
not
sure
that
i
should
do
it
even
then
but
in
case
you
change
your
mind
i
propose
to
tell
nobody
not
even
your
mother
by
the
time
you
get
this
letter
it
will
be
six
weeks
since
yours
to
me
and
you
may
look
at
things
differently
perhaps
by
then
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
have
told
your
mother
merely
that
you
have
been
ordered
away
for
a
change
and
i
shall
say
the
same
to
anyone
else
who
inquires
for
you
if
you
feel
after
this
time
still
responsible
and
that
you
have
a
certain
duty
still
remember
even
so
you
might
be
very
unhappy
together
all
your
lives
excuse
me
then
if
i
do
take
you
at
your
word
point
occurs
to
me
in
your
hurry
and
excitement
perhaps
you
forgot
that
your
father
legacy
depended
on
the
condition
that
you
should
not
leave
the
foreign
office
before
you
were
fifty
that
is
about
fourteen
years
from
now
if
you
are
legally
freed
and
marry
miss
argles
you
could
hardly
go
back
there
i
think
it
would
be
practically
impossible
under
those
circumstances
while
if
you
live
in
australia
you
will
have
hardly
any
means
i
merely
remind
you
of
this
in
case
you
had
forgotten
shall
regard
it
all
as
an
unfortunate
aberration
and
if
you
regret
it
and
change
your
mind
you
will
be
free
at
any
time
you
like
to
come
back
and
nothing
shall
be
ever
said
about
it
but
i
not
begging
you
to
do
so
i
may
be
wrong
perhaps
she
the
woman
to
make
you
happy
let
me
know
within
three
months
how
you
feel
about
it
will
suffer
except
myself
during
this
time
as
i
shall
keep
it
from
your
mother
and
shall
remain
here
during
this
time
perhaps
you
will
be
very
angry
with
me
that
i
do
wish
to
take
you
at
your
word
bruce
at
first
i
thought
i
would
but
i
doing
what
i
think
right
and
one
can
not
do
more
not
going
to
reproach
you
for
if
you
do
feel
the
claims
of
others
on
you
my
words
will
make
no
difference
over
what
i
say
should
you
be
unhappy
and
wish
to
separate
from
her
without
knowing
how
and
if
it
becomes
a
question
of
money
as
so
many
things
do
i
would
help
you
i
did
not
remind
you
about
your
father
legacy
to
induce
you
to
come
back
if
you
really
find
happiness
in
the
way
you
expect
we
could
arrange
it
you
see
i
have
thought
of
everything
in
one
night
but
you
be
happy
ottley
whenever
you
like
to
come
back
you
will
be
welcomed
and
nothing
shall
ever
be
said
about
it
aylmer
gave
her
back
the
letter
he
was
touched
see
she
said
eagerly
have
got
a
grain
of
jealousy
all
that
part
is
quite
finished
that
the
very
reason
why
i
can
judge
calmly
she
fastened
up
the
letter
and
then
said
with
a
smile
now
let
be
happy
the
rest
of
the
summer
wo
you
he
answered
that
she
was
marvellous
that
he
would
help
her
devote
himself
to
doing
whatever
she
wished
on
consideration
he
saw
that
there
was
still
hope
chapter
xxviii
bruce
returns
edith
exclaimed
vincy
fixing
his
eyeglass
in
his
eye
and
opening
his
mouth
in
astonishment
well
i
gormed
a
week
had
passed
since
the
news
of
bruce
elopement
the
little
group
at
westgate
did
seem
to
have
much
been
affected
by
it
and
this
was
the
less
surprising
as
aylmer
and
edith
had
kept
it
to
themselves
mrs
ottley
listened
imperturbably
to
edith
story
a
somewhat
incoherent
concoction
but
told
with
dash
and
decision
that
bruce
had
been
ordered
away
for
a
for
fear
of
a
nervous
breakdown
she
cried
a
little
said
nothing
kissed
edith
more
than
usual
and
took
the
children
away
for
longer
walks
and
drives
with
a
flashlight
of
intuition
she
felt
at
once
certain
there
was
something
wrong
but
she
did
wish
to
probe
the
subject
her
confidence
in
edith
reached
the
point
of
superstition
she
would
never
ask
her
questions
edith
had
assured
her
that
bruce
would
come
back
all
right
and
that
was
enough
personally
mrs
ottley
much
preferred
the
society
of
aylmer
to
that
of
her
son
aylmer
was
far
more
amusing
far
more
considerate
to
her
and
to
everybody
else
and
he
did
use
his
natural
charm
for
those
who
amused
him
only
as
the
ordinary
fascinating
man
does
probably
there
was
at
the
back
of
his
attentions
to
mrs
ottley
a
vague
idea
that
he
wanted
to
get
her
on
his
side
that
she
might
be
a
useful
ally
but
he
was
always
charming
to
elderly
women
and
inclined
to
be
brusque
with
younger
ones
excepting
edith
he
remembered
his
own
mother
with
so
great
a
cult
of
devotion
and
his
late
wife
with
such
a
depressed
indifference
edith
had
asked
aylmer
to
try
and
forget
what
had
happened
to
make
himself
believe
that
bruce
had
really
only
gone
away
medicinally
for
the
present
he
did
as
she
wished
but
he
was
longing
to
begin
talking
to
her
on
the
subject
again
both
because
it
interested
him
passionately
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
and
far
more
naturally
because
he
had
hopes
of
persuading
her
in
time
she
was
not
bound
by
letter
she
could
change
her
mind
bruce
might
and
possibly
would
insist
there
was
difficulty
in
keeping
the
secret
from
vincy
who
was
actually
staying
in
the
house
and
whose
wonderful
nerves
and
whimsical
mind
were
so
sensitive
to
every
variation
of
his
surroundings
he
had
the
gift
of
reading
people
minds
but
it
never
annoyed
anyone
one
felt
he
had
no
illusions
that
he
sympathised
with
one
weaknesses
and
follies
and
in
a
sense
enjoyed
them
from
a
literary
point
of
view
probably
his
friends
forgave
his
clear
vision
for
the
sake
of
his
interest
most
people
would
far
rather
be
seen
through
than
not
be
seen
at
all
one
day
vincy
alone
on
the
beach
with
edith
remarked
that
he
wondered
what
had
happened
to
mavis
edith
told
him
that
she
had
run
away
with
a
married
man
edith
he
exclaimed
would
have
thought
it
it
seems
almost
too
good
to
be
true
say
that
vincy
how
did
you
hear
it
you
know
everything
heard
it
on
good
authority
i
it
true
to
think
i
was
passing
the
remark
only
the
other
day
that
i
thought
i
ought
to
look
her
up
in
a
manner
of
speaking
or
write
continued
vincy
who
the
poor
dear
man
do
you
know
he
looked
at
her
with
a
sudden
vague
suspicion
of
he
knew
not
what
was
always
inclined
to
be
romantic
you
know
she
said
steadily
give
over
that
it
i
did
want
anyone
to
know
about
it
i
so
afraid
of
making
mrs
ottley
unhappy
you
not
serious
edith
suppose
i
better
show
you
his
letter
he
tells
me
to
ask
your
advice
she
gave
it
to
him
is
only
one
word
for
what
i
feel
about
it
vincy
said
as
he
gave
it
back
gormed
simply
gormed
gormed
edith
dear
is
really
the
only
word
not
jealous
said
edith
last
trouble
with
bruce
seems
to
have
cured
me
of
any
feeling
of
the
kind
but
i
have
a
sort
of
pity
and
affection
for
him
still
in
a
way
almost
like
a
mother
i
really
afraid
he
will
be
miserable
with
her
and
then
he
feel
tied
to
her
and
be
wretched
all
his
life
so
i
giving
him
a
chance
he
looked
at
her
with
admiring
sympathy
what
about
other
friends
oh
you
know
i
awfully
sorry
i
wish
i
married
her
now
then
she
would
have
bothered
about
bruce
you
ca
stand
her
vincy
know
edith
dear
but
i
marry
any
number
of
people
to
prevent
anything
tiresome
for
you
and
aylmer
of
course
edith
really
i
think
aylmer
ought
to
go
away
i
sure
he
ought
it
is
a
mistake
to
let
him
stay
here
under
these
circumstances
said
edith
do
see
that
if
i
were
going
to
take
bruce
at
his
word
then
it
would
be
different
of
course
does
seem
a
pity
not
to
in
some
ways
everything
would
be
all
nicely
settled
up
just
like
the
fourth
act
of
a
play
and
then
i
should
be
glad
i
had
married
mavis
oh
do
let
it
be
like
the
fourth
act
edith
can
life
be
like
a
play
it
hopeless
to
attempt
it
she
said
rather
sadly
do
you
think
if
bruce
knew
how
much
you
liked
aylmer
he
would
have
written
that
letter
and
i
do
believe
he
would
ever
have
gone
away
i
think
you
ought
to
send
aylmer
away
now
she
repeated
could
be
more
intensely
correct
mrs
ottley
staying
with
me
why
should
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
aylmer
because
bruce
is
having
a
heavenly
time
on
board
ship
suppose
there
that
point
of
view
said
vincy
rather
bewildered
say
edith
bruce
having
a
heavenly
time
on
board
ship
a
she
always
grumbles
she
always
complaining
she
never
never
satisfied
she
keeps
on
making
scenes
does
bruce
but
i
suppose
if
there
a
certain
predicament
then
oh
edith
are
you
unhappy
not
a
bit
now
i
think
i
only
really
unhappy
when
i
undecided
once
i
taken
a
line
no
matter
what
it
is
i
can
be
happy
again
i
can
adjust
myself
to
my
good
fortune
curiously
when
edith
had
once
got
over
the
pain
and
shock
that
the
letter
first
gave
her
she
was
positively
happier
now
than
she
ever
had
been
before
bruce
really
must
have
been
a
more
formidable
bore
than
she
had
known
since
his
absence
left
such
a
delicious
freedom
the
certainty
of
having
done
the
right
the
wisest
thing
was
a
support
a
proud
satisfaction
during
these
summer
days
aylmer
was
not
so
peacefully
happy
his
devotion
was
assiduous
silent
discreet
and
sometimes
his
feelings
were
almost
uncontrollable
but
he
hoped
and
he
consoled
himself
by
the
thought
that
some
day
he
would
really
have
his
wish
anything
might
happen
the
chances
were
all
in
his
favour
what
an
extraordinary
woman
she
was
and
how
pretty
how
subtle
how
perfect
their
life
might
be
together
he
implored
vincy
to
use
his
influence
ca
see
edith
in
anything
so
crude
as
the
as
that
court
vincy
said
bruce
begs
her
to
do
it
what
could
their
life
be
together
afterwards
it
simply
a
deliberate
sacrifice
every
hope
that
miss
argles
will
never
let
him
go
said
vincy
has
to
be
very
firm
to
get
away
from
her
oh
ever
so
firm
and
you
ca
think
how
many
times
a
day
she
must
be
reproaching
bruce
that
will
be
rather
a
change
for
him
however
anything
may
happen
said
vincy
soothingly
he
still
maintained
for
he
had
a
very
strong
sense
of
propriety
in
matters
of
form
that
aylmer
ought
to
go
away
but
edith
would
not
agree
so
the
children
played
and
enjoyed
themselves
and
sometimes
asked
after
their
father
and
mrs
ottley
though
a
little
anxious
enjoyed
herself
too
and
edith
had
never
been
so
happy
she
was
having
a
holiday
she
dismissed
all
trouble
and
lived
in
a
sort
of
dream
towards
the
end
of
the
summer
hearing
no
more
from
bruce
aylmer
grew
still
more
hopeful
he
began
to
regard
it
as
practically
settled
the
next
letter
in
answer
to
edith
would
doubtless
convince
her
and
he
would
then
persuade
her
it
was
tacitly
he
thought
almost
agreed
now
it
was
not
spoken
of
between
them
but
he
believed
it
was
all
right
aylmer
had
come
back
to
london
in
the
early
days
of
september
and
was
wandering
through
his
house
thinking
how
he
would
have
it
done
up
and
how
he
would
leave
it
when
they
were
married
when
a
telephone
message
summoned
him
to
knightsbridge
he
went
and
found
the
elder
mrs
ottley
just
going
away
he
thought
she
looked
at
him
rather
strangely
think
edith
wants
to
speak
to
you
she
said
as
she
left
the
room
edith
be
nice
to
her
and
she
fled
aylmer
waited
alone
looking
round
the
room
that
he
loved
because
he
associated
it
with
her
it
was
one
of
the
first
cold
damp
days
of
the
autumn
and
there
was
a
fire
edith
came
in
in
a
dark
dress
looking
pale
and
different
he
thought
she
had
seemed
the
very
spirit
of
summer
only
a
day
or
two
before
a
chill
presentiment
struck
to
his
heart
had
a
letter
go
on
do
keep
me
in
suspense
he
spoke
with
nervous
impatience
and
no
she
sat
down
by
him
she
had
no
wish
to
create
an
effect
but
she
found
it
difficult
to
speak
i
had
a
letter
she
said
quietly
quarrelled
they
quarrelled
on
board
he
hates
her
he
says
he
would
rather
die
than
remain
with
her
he
written
me
a
rather
nice
letter
they
quarrelled
so
frightfully
that
a
young
man
on
board
interfered
she
said
smiling
faintly
soon
as
they
arrived
the
young
man
married
her
he
a
commercial
traveller
he
only
it
seems
he
pitied
her
so
much
that
he
proposed
to
her
on
board
and
she
left
bruce
it
true
about
the
predicament
it
was
a
mistake
bruce
was
grateful
for
my
letter
he
glad
i
not
told
anyone
not
done
anything
now
the
children
will
never
know
but
i
told
mrs
ottley
all
about
it
i
thought
i
better
now
it
over
she
wo
ask
him
questions
bruce
is
on
his
way
home
right
said
aylmer
getting
up
him
come
forgive
him
again
that
right
would
you
have
done
that
for
never
if
you
had
once
been
unfaithful
and
i
knew
it
i
never
have
forgiven
you
quite
believe
it
but
why
i
care
for
you
too
much
if
you
had
been
in
bruce
position
i
should
never
have
seen
you
again
with
him
it
different
it
a
feeling
of
it
for
him
not
for
me
i
felt
no
jealousy
no
passion
so
i
could
judge
calmly
right
repeated
aylmer
ironically
right
judge
calmly
do
the
right
thing
you
know
best
he
stopped
a
moment
and
then
said
taking
his
hat
understand
now
i
see
clearly
at
last
you
had
the
opportunity
and
you
would
take
it
you
do
care
for
me
going
he
went
to
the
door
come
back
aylmer
do
go
like
that
you
know
i
care
for
you
but
what
could
i
do
i
foresaw
this
you
know
i
ca
feel
responsibility
about
bruce
i
could
make
my
happiness
out
of
someone
else
misery
he
would
have
been
miserable
and
not
only
that
it
would
have
been
his
ruin
bruce
could
never
be
safe
happy
or
all
right
except
here
you
think
he
alter
now
be
grateful
and
devoted
i
suppose
appreciate
you
people
alter
she
answered
neither
know
nor
care
if
he
will
but
you
i
could
have
made
you
happy
you
wo
let
me
oh
edith
how
could
you
torture
me
like
this
all
the
summer
did
mean
to
torture
you
we
enjoyed
being
together
but
it
makes
this
so
much
harder
would
be
such
a
risk
she
answered
is
anything
worth
having
unless
you
ready
to
risk
to
get
it
risk
everything
for
myself
but
not
for
others
if
you
feel
you
want
to
go
away
she
said
it
be
only
for
a
little
while
little
while
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
again
do
you
think
such
a
miserable
fool
do
you
think
i
could
endure
the
position
of
a
tame
cat
you
forget
i
a
man
no
i
never
see
you
again
now
not
if
it
kills
me
at
these
words
the
first
harsh
ones
she
had
ever
heard
from
him
her
nerves
gave
way
and
she
burst
into
tears
this
made
him
irresolute
for
his
almost
reached
the
point
of
weakness
he
went
up
to
her
as
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
her
once
more
then
he
said
you
chosen
you
been
cruel
to
me
and
you
too
good
to
him
but
i
suppose
you
must
carry
out
your
own
nature
edith
i
been
the
victim
that
all
wo
you
be
friends
she
said
i
wo
and
i
ca
he
waited
one
moment
more
you
change
your
mind
you
still
can
we
can
still
be
happy
we
can
be
everything
to
each
other
give
him
up
give
him
up
ca
said
edith
chapter
xxix
intellectual
sympathy
are
you
going
to
wear
tonight
edith
anything
say
anything
i
do
wish
you
to
wear
anything
i
anxious
you
should
look
your
best
really
nice
especially
as
we
have
been
to
the
mitchells
for
so
long
wear
your
new
blue
dress
well
bruce
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
and
looked
in
the
glass
i
a
bit
sunburnt
he
remarked
thoughtfully
it
does
suit
me
badly
not
really
badly
does
it
at
all
i
spoken
about
it
once
i
spoken
about
it
forty
times
this
is
too
full
see
about
it
let
me
have
to
speak
about
it
again
will
you
i
wonder
who
will
be
at
the
mitchells
tonight
i
suppose
there
be
the
new
person
the
woman
with
the
dramatic
contralto
foghorn
voice
and
the
usual
people
mr
cricker
lady
everard
miss
mooney
mooney
i
hope
not
i
ca
stand
that
woman
i
think
absurd
she
a
mass
of
affectation
and
prudishness
and
edith
do
want
to
interfere
between
mother
and
daughter
i
know
perfectly
capable
and
thoroughly
well
suited
to
bringing
up
a
girl
but
i
really
do
think
you
encouraging
dilly
in
too
great
extravagance
in
what
way
found
her
making
a
pinafore
for
her
doll
out
of
a
lace
flounce
of
real
old
venetian
lace
dilly
said
she
found
it
on
the
floor
the
floor
indeed
i
said
to
her
must
use
real
lace
she
said
not
it
a
real
doll
lately
dilly
got
a
way
of
answering
back
that
i
do
like
at
all
speak
to
her
about
it
will
you
edith
yes
of
course
i
will
afraid
my
mother
spoils
them
however
archie
will
be
going
to
school
soon
of
course
it
is
for
me
to
interfere
i
have
always
made
a
point
of
letting
you
do
exactly
as
you
like
about
the
children
have
i
edith
but
i
beginning
to
think
really
dilly
ought
to
have
another
gov
he
stopped
looking
she
only
five
quite
a
baby
said
edith
daresay
i
can
manage
her
for
the
present
leave
it
to
me
since
his
return
edith
had
never
once
referred
to
bruce
once
or
twice
he
had
thanked
her
with
real
gratitude
and
even
remorse
for
the
line
she
had
taken
but
her
one
revenge
had
been
to
change
the
subject
immediately
if
bruce
wished
to
discuss
the
elopement
that
she
had
so
laboriously
concealed
he
would
have
to
go
elsewhere
a
brilliantly
coloured
version
glittering
with
success
and
lurid
with
melodrama
had
been
given
greatly
against
the
hearer
will
to
goldthorpe
at
the
club
one
of
the
most
annoying
things
to
bruce
was
that
he
was
perfectly
convinced
when
he
was
confessing
the
exact
truth
that
goldthorpe
did
believe
a
word
of
it
it
was
unfortunate
too
for
bruce
that
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
keep
it
from
vincy
and
not
to
speak
of
the
affair
at
all
was
a
real
sacrifice
on
vincy
part
also
for
they
would
both
have
enjoyed
discussing
it
while
goldthorpe
the
only
human
being
in
whom
bruce
ever
really
confided
was
not
only
bored
but
incredulous
he
considered
bruce
not
only
tedious
to
the
verge
of
imbecility
but
unreliable
beyond
the
pardonable
point
of
inaccuracy
in
fact
bruce
was
his
ideal
of
the
most
wearisome
of
liars
and
the
most
untruthful
of
bores
and
here
was
poor
vincy
dying
to
hear
all
about
his
old
friend
mavis
he
never
knew
even
whether
she
had
mentioned
his
name
ready
to
revel
with
his
peculiar
humour
in
every
detail
of
the
strange
romance
particularly
to
enjoy
her
sudden
desertion
of
bruce
for
an
unmarried
commercial
traveller
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
on
and
yet
it
had
to
be
withheld
bruce
felt
it
would
be
disloyal
and
he
had
the
decency
to
be
ashamed
to
speak
of
his
escapade
to
an
intimate
friend
of
his
wife
bruce
complained
very
much
of
the
dullness
of
the
early
autumn
in
london
without
aylmer
this
sudden
mania
for
long
journeys
on
part
was
a
most
annoying
hobby
he
would
never
get
such
a
pleasant
friend
as
aylmer
again
aylmer
was
his
hero
do
you
think
he
gone
away
he
rather
irritatingly
persisted
have
the
slightest
idea
you
know
edith
it
has
sometimes
occurred
to
me
that
if
that
well
well
you
know
what
i
mean
if
things
had
turned
out
differently
and
you
had
done
as
i
asked
you
i
have
a
sort
of
idea
he
looked
away
aylmer
might
well
might
have
proposed
to
you
an
extraordinary
idea
he
never
did
show
any
sign
whatever
i
suppose
of
well
of
being
more
interested
in
you
than
he
ought
to
have
been
heavens
no
of
course
i
know
that
you
not
his
style
you
liked
him
very
much
did
you
edith
like
him
very
much
now
i
doubt
if
you
ever
quite
appreciated
him
he
so
full
of
ability
such
an
intellectual
chap
aylmer
is
more
a
man
man
miss
him
of
course
he
was
a
very
great
friend
of
mine
and
he
ever
at
all
in
the
least
seem
to
to
what
would
have
been
a
very
unfair
advantage
to
take
of
my
absence
if
he
had
continued
bruce
he
was
incapable
of
it
of
course
course
showed
any
special
interest
then
beyond
was
right
i
suppose
as
usual
you
never
appreciated
him
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
a
woman
appreciate
but
he
a
great
loss
to
me
edith
i
need
a
man
who
can
understand
intellectual
sympathy
vincy
announced
the
servant
vincy
had
not
lost
his
extraordinary
gift
for
turning
up
at
the
right
moment
he
was
more
welcome
than
ever
now
