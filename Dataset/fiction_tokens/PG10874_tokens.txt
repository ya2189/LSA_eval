the
two
ladies
received
hardy
information
with
something
akin
to
consternation
the
idea
of
the
autocrat
of
equator
lodge
as
a
stowaway
on
board
the
ship
of
his
ancient
enemy
proving
too
serious
for
ordinary
comment
kingdom
usual
expressions
of
surprise
well
i
never
did
and
good
gracious
alive
died
on
her
lips
and
she
sat
gazing
helpless
and
at
her
niece
i
wonder
what
he
said
she
gasped
at
last
miss
nugent
who
was
trying
to
imagine
her
father
in
his
new
role
aboard
the
conqueror
paid
no
heed
it
was
not
a
pleasant
idea
and
her
eyes
flashed
with
temper
as
she
thought
of
it
sooner
or
later
the
whole
affair
would
be
public
property
i
had
an
idea
all
along
that
he
was
in
london
murmured
kingdom
fancy
that
nathan
smith
standing
in
sam
room
telling
us
falsehoods
like
that
he
never
even
blushed
but
you
said
that
you
kept
picturing
father
walking
about
the
streets
of
london
wrestling
with
his
pride
and
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
come
home
again
said
her
niece
maliciously
kingdom
fidgeted
but
before
she
could
think
of
a
satisfactory
reply
bella
came
to
the
door
and
asked
to
speak
to
her
for
a
moment
profiting
by
her
absence
hardy
leaned
towards
miss
nugent
and
in
a
low
voice
expressed
his
sorrow
at
the
mishap
to
her
father
and
his
firm
conviction
that
everything
that
could
be
thought
of
for
that
unfortunate
comfort
would
be
done
our
fathers
will
probably
come
back
good
friends
he
concluded
there
is
nothing
would
give
me
more
pleasure
than
that
and
i
think
that
we
had
better
begin
and
set
them
a
good
example
it
is
no
good
setting
an
example
to
people
who
are
hundreds
of
miles
away
said
the
miss
nugent
besides
if
they
have
made
friends
they
do
want
an
example
set
them
but
in
that
case
they
have
set
us
an
example
which
we
ought
to
follow
urged
hardy
miss
nugent
raised
her
eyes
to
his
why
do
you
wish
to
be
on
friendly
terms
she
asked
with
disconcerting
composure
illustration
do
you
wish
to
be
on
friendly
terms
she
asked
i
should
like
to
know
your
father
returned
hardy
with
perfect
gravity
and
kingdom
and
you
he
eyed
her
steadily
as
he
spoke
and
miss
nugent
despite
her
utmost
efforts
realized
with
some
indignation
that
a
faint
tinge
of
colour
was
creeping
into
her
cheeks
she
remembered
his
covert
challenge
at
their
last
interview
at
wilks
and
the
necessity
of
reading
this
persistent
young
man
a
stern
lesson
came
to
her
with
all
the
force
of
a
public
duty
why
she
inquired
softly
as
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
assumed
a
pensive
expression
i
admire
him
for
one
thing
as
a
fine
seaman
said
hardy
yes
said
miss
nugent
and
and
i
always
had
a
great
liking
for
kingdom
he
continued
she
was
very
to
me
when
i
was
a
very
small
boy
i
remember
she
is
very
kind
and
amiable
the
baffled
miss
nugent
stole
a
glance
at
him
and
she
said
again
very
softly
and
very
motherly
said
hardy
without
moving
a
muscle
miss
nugent
pondered
and
stole
another
glance
at
him
the
expression
of
his
face
was
ingenuous
not
to
say
simple
she
resolved
to
risk
it
so
far
he
had
always
won
in
their
brief
encounters
and
monotony
was
always
distasteful
to
her
especially
monotony
of
that
kind
and
what
about
me
she
said
with
a
friendly
smile
you
said
hardy
with
a
gravity
of
voice
belied
by
the
amusement
in
his
eye
you
are
the
daughter
of
the
fine
seaman
and
the
niece
of
the
and
motherly
mrs
kingdom
miss
nugent
looked
down
again
hastily
and
all
the
shrew
within
her
clamoured
for
vengeance
it
was
the
same
masterful
jem
hardy
that
had
forced
his
way
into
their
seat
at
church
as
a
boy
if
he
went
on
in
this
way
he
would
become
unbearable
she
resolved
at
the
cost
of
much
personal
inconvenience
to
give
him
a
fall
but
she
realized
quite
clearly
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
time
of
course
you
and
jack
are
already
good
friends
she
said
softly
very
assented
hardy
such
good
friends
that
i
have
been
devoting
a
lot
of
time
lately
to
considering
ways
and
means
of
getting
him
out
of
the
snares
of
the
kybirds
i
should
have
thought
that
that
was
his
affair
said
miss
nugent
haughtily
mine
too
said
hardy
i
do
want
him
to
marry
miss
kybird
for
the
first
time
since
the
engagement
miss
nugent
almost
approved
of
it
why
not
let
him
know
your
wishes
she
said
gently
surely
that
would
be
sufficient
but
you
do
want
them
to
marry
said
hardy
ignoring
the
remark
i
do
want
my
brother
to
do
anything
shabby
replied
the
girl
but
i
should
be
sorry
of
course
if
they
did
not
very
good
said
hardy
armed
with
your
consent
i
shall
leave
no
stone
unturned
nugent
was
let
in
for
this
and
i
am
going
to
get
him
out
if
i
can
all
fair
in
love
and
war
you
do
mind
my
doing
anything
shabby
not
in
the
least
replied
miss
nugent
promptly
the
reappearance
of
kingdom
at
this
moment
saved
hardy
the
necessity
of
a
reply
conversation
reverted
to
the
missing
captain
and
hardy
and
kingdom
together
drew
such
a
picture
of
the
two
captains
fraternizing
that
miss
nugent
felt
that
the
millennium
itself
could
have
no
surprises
for
her
he
has
improved
very
much
said
kingdom
after
the
door
had
closed
behind
their
visitor
so
thoughtful
he
thoughtful
enough
agreed
her
niece
he
is
what
i
call
extremely
considerate
pursued
the
elder
lady
but
i
afraid
he
is
weak
anybody
could
turn
him
round
their
little
finger
i
believe
they
could
said
miss
nugent
gazing
at
her
with
admiration
if
he
wanted
to
be
turned
the
ice
thus
broken
hardy
spent
the
following
day
or
two
in
devising
plausible
reasons
for
another
visit
he
found
one
in
the
person
of
wilks
who
having
been
unsuccessful
in
finding
his
beloved
master
at
a
small
tavern
down
by
the
london
docks
had
returned
to
sunwich
by
no
means
benefited
by
his
change
of
air
to
learn
the
terrible
truth
as
to
his
disappearance
from
hardy
i
wish
they
shanghaid
me
instead
he
said
to
that
sympathetic
listener
or
mrs
silk
eh
said
the
other
staring
wot
be
the
end
of
it
i
do
know
said
wilks
laying
a
hand
which
still
trembled
on
the
other
knee
it
got
about
that
she
saved
my
life
by
careful
nussing
and
the
way
she
shakes
at
me
for
risking
my
valuable
life
as
she
calls
it
going
up
to
london
gives
me
the
shivers
nonsense
said
hardy
she
ca
marry
you
against
your
will
just
be
distantly
civil
to
her
can
you
be
distantly
civil
when
she
lives
just
opposite
inquired
the
steward
querulously
she
sent
teddy
over
at
ten
last
night
to
rub
my
chest
with
a
bottle
o
liniment
and
it
no
good
me
saying
all
right
when
she
been
spending
o
good
money
over
the
stuff
she
ca
marry
you
unless
you
ask
her
said
the
comforter
wilks
shook
his
head
people
in
the
alley
are
beginning
to
talk
he
said
dolefully
just
as
i
came
in
this
afternoon
old
george
lee
screwed
up
one
eye
at
two
or
three
women
wot
was
gossiping
near
and
when
i
asked
wot
got
to
wink
about
he
said
that
a
bit
o
blowed
in
his
eye
as
i
passed
it
sent
them
silly
creeturs
into
fits
illustration
he
said
that
a
bit
o
blowed
in
his
eye
they
soon
get
tired
of
it
said
hardy
wilks
still
gloomy
ventured
to
doubt
it
but
cheered
up
and
became
almost
bright
when
his
visitor
announced
his
intention
of
trying
to
smooth
over
matters
for
him
at
equator
lodge
he
became
quite
voluble
in
his
defence
and
attached
much
importance
to
the
fact
that
he
had
nursed
miss
nugent
when
she
was
in
long
clothes
and
had
taught
her
to
whistle
like
an
angel
at
the
age
of
five
i
felt
being
cut
adrift
by
her
more
than
anything
he
said
brokenly
years
i
sailed
with
the
and
served
faithful
and
this
is
my
reward
hardy
pleaded
his
case
next
day
miss
nugent
was
alone
when
he
called
and
moved
by
the
vivid
picture
he
drew
of
the
old
man
loneliness
accorded
her
full
forgiveness
and
decided
to
pay
him
a
visit
at
once
the
fact
that
hardy
had
not
been
in
the
house
five
minutes
she
appeared
to
have
overlooked
i
go
upstairs
and
put
my
hat
and
jacket
on
and
go
now
she
said
brightly
that
very
kind
of
you
said
hardy
his
voice
expressed
admiring
gratitude
but
he
made
no
sign
of
leaving
his
seat
you
do
mind
said
miss
nugent
pausing
in
front
of
him
and
slightly
extending
her
hand
not
in
the
least
was
the
reply
but
i
want
to
see
wilks
myself
perhaps
you
let
me
walk
down
with
you
the
request
was
so
unexpected
that
the
girl
had
no
refusal
ready
she
hesitated
and
was
lost
finally
she
expressed
a
fear
that
she
might
keep
him
waiting
too
long
while
she
got
ready
a
fear
which
he
politely
declined
to
consider
well
we
see
said
the
marvelling
miss
nugent
to
herself
as
she
went
slowly
upstairs
he
got
impudence
enough
for
forty
she
commenced
her
preparations
for
seeing
wilks
by
wrapping
a
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
reclining
in
an
with
a
novel
it
was
a
good
story
but
the
room
was
very
cold
and
even
the
pleasure
of
snubbing
an
intrusive
young
man
did
not
make
amends
for
the
lack
of
warmth
she
read
and
shivered
for
an
hour
and
then
with
chilled
fingers
lit
the
gas
and
proceeded
to
array
herself
for
the
journey
her
temper
was
not
improved
by
seeing
hardy
sitting
in
the
dark
over
a
good
fire
when
she
got
downstairs
i
afraid
i
kept
you
waiting
she
said
crisply
not
at
all
said
hardy
i
been
very
comfortable
miss
nugent
repressed
a
shiver
and
crossing
to
the
fire
thoughtlessly
extended
her
fingers
over
the
blaze
i
afraid
you
cold
said
hardy
the
girl
looked
round
sharply
his
face
or
as
much
of
it
as
she
could
see
in
the
firelight
bore
a
look
of
honest
concern
somewhat
at
variance
with
the
quality
of
his
voice
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
absurdity
of
altering
her
plans
on
his
account
she
would
have
postponed
her
visit
to
the
steward
until
another
day
the
walk
to
fullalove
alley
was
all
too
short
for
jem
hardy
miss
nugent
stepped
along
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
anxious
to
get
to
the
stake
and
have
it
over
and
she
answered
in
monosyllables
when
her
companion
pointed
out
the
beauties
of
the
night
a
bitter
east
wind
blew
up
the
road
and
set
her
yearning
for
the
joys
of
wilks
best
room
it
very
cold
she
said
shivering
hardy
assented
and
reluctantly
quickened
his
pace
to
keep
step
with
hers
miss
nugent
with
her
chin
sunk
in
a
fur
boa
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
and
turning
briskly
into
the
alley
turned
the
handle
of
wilks
door
and
walked
in
leaving
her
companion
to
follow
the
steward
who
was
smoking
a
long
pipe
over
the
fire
looked
round
in
alarm
then
his
expression
changed
and
he
rose
and
stammered
out
a
welcome
two
minutes
later
miss
nugent
enthroned
in
the
best
chair
with
her
toes
on
the
fender
gave
her
faithful
subject
a
free
pardon
and
full
permission
to
make
hot
coffee
and
do
you
ever
try
and
deceive
me
again
sam
she
said
as
she
sipped
the
comforting
beverage
no
miss
said
the
steward
humbly
i
a
lesson
i
never
try
and
shanghai
anybody
else
agin
as
long
as
i
live
after
this
virtuous
sentiment
he
sat
and
smoked
placidly
with
occasional
curious
glances
divided
between
his
two
visitors
an
idle
and
ridiculous
idea
which
occurred
to
him
in
connection
with
them
was
dismissed
at
once
as
too
preposterous
for
a
sensible
steward
to
entertain
kingdom
well
he
inquired
quite
well
said
the
girl
if
you
take
me
home
sam
you
shall
see
her
and
be
forgiven
by
her
too
thankee
miss
said
the
gratified
steward
and
what
about
your
foot
wilks
said
hardy
somewhat
taken
aback
by
this
arrangement
foot
sir
said
the
unconscious
wilks
wot
foot
why
the
bad
one
said
hardy
with
a
significant
glance
ho
that
one
said
wilks
beating
time
and
waiting
further
revelations
do
you
think
you
ought
to
use
it
much
inquired
hardy
wilks
looked
at
it
or
to
be
more
exact
looked
at
both
of
them
and
smiled
weakly
his
previous
idea
recurred
to
him
with
renewed
force
now
and
several
things
in
the
young
man
behaviour
hitherto
disregarded
became
suddenly
charged
with
significance
miss
nugent
looked
on
with
an
air
of
cynical
interest
better
not
run
any
risk
said
hardy
gravely
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
see
miss
nugent
home
if
she
will
allow
me
what
is
the
matter
with
it
inquired
miss
nugent
looking
him
full
in
the
face
hardy
hesitated
diplomacy
he
told
himself
was
one
thing
lying
another
he
passed
the
question
on
to
the
rather
badly
used
wilks
matter
with
it
repeated
that
gentleman
glaring
at
him
reproachfully
it
got
shootin
pains
right
up
it
i
suppose
it
was
walking
miles
and
miles
every
day
in
london
looking
for
the
was
too
much
for
it
is
it
too
bad
for
you
to
take
me
home
sam
inquired
miss
nugent
softly
the
perturbed
wilks
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
a
sportsman
his
sympathies
were
with
hardy
but
his
duty
lay
with
the
girl
i
do
my
best
miss
he
said
and
got
up
and
limped
very
well
indeed
for
a
first
attempt
round
the
room
then
miss
nugent
did
a
thing
which
was
a
puzzle
to
herself
for
some
time
afterwards
having
won
the
victory
she
deliberately
threw
away
the
fruits
of
it
and
declining
to
allow
the
steward
to
run
any
risks
accepted
hardy
escort
home
wilks
watched
them
from
the
door
and
with
his
head
in
a
whirl
caused
by
the
night
proceedings
mixed
himself
a
stiff
glass
of
grog
to
set
it
right
and
drank
to
the
health
of
both
of
them
illustration
wilks
drank
to
the
health
of
both
of
them
the
wind
had
abated
somewhat
in
violence
as
they
walked
home
and
moreover
they
had
their
backs
to
it
the
walk
was
slower
and
more
enjoyable
in
many
respects
than
the
walk
out
in
an
unusually
soft
mood
she
replied
to
his
remarks
and
stole
little
critical
glances
up
at
him
when
they
reached
the
house
she
stood
a
little
while
at
the
gate
gazing
at
the
starry
sky
and
listening
to
the
crash
of
the
sea
on
the
beach
it
is
a
fine
night
she
said
as
she
shook
hands
the
best
i
have
ever
known
said
hardy
chapter
xvii
the
weeks
passed
all
too
quickly
for
james
hardy
he
saw
kate
nugent
at
her
own
home
met
her
thanks
to
the
able
and
hearty
assistance
of
wilks
at
fullalove
alley
and
on
several
occasions
had
the
agreeable
task
of
escorting
her
back
home
he
cabled
to
his
father
for
news
of
the
illustrious
stowaway
immediately
the
was
notified
as
having
reached
port
elizabeth
the
reply
left
ship
confirmed
his
worst
fears
but
he
cheerfully
accepted
kingdom
view
that
the
captain
in
order
to
relieve
the
natural
anxiety
of
his
family
had
secured
a
passage
on
the
first
vessel
homeward
bound
captain
hardy
was
the
first
to
reach
home
in
the
early
hours
of
a
fine
april
morning
the
steamed
slowly
into
sunwich
harbour
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
town
was
revelling
in
a
description
of
captain
nugent
first
voyage
before
the
mast
from
lips
which
were
never
tired
of
repeating
it
down
by
the
waterside
nathan
smith
found
that
he
had
suddenly
attained
the
rank
of
a
popular
hero
and
his
modesty
took
alarm
at
the
publicity
afforded
to
his
action
it
was
extremely
distasteful
to
a
man
who
ran
a
quiet
business
on
lines
and
disbelieved
in
advertisement
he
lost
three
lodgers
the
same
day
illustration
a
popular
hero
jem
hardy
was
one
of
the
few
people
in
sunwich
for
whom
the
joke
had
no
charms
and
he
betrayed
such
an
utter
lack
of
sympathy
with
his
recital
that
the
latter
accused
him
at
last
of
wanting
a
sense
of
humour
i
do
see
anything
amusing
in
it
said
his
son
stiffly
captain
hardy
recapitulated
one
or
two
choice
points
and
was
even
at
some
pains
to
explain
them
i
ca
see
any
fun
in
it
repeated
his
son
your
behaviour
seems
to
me
to
have
been
deplorable
what
shouted
the
captain
hardly
able
to
believe
his
ears
captain
nugent
was
your
guest
pursued
the
other
he
got
on
your
ship
by
accident
and
he
should
have
been
treated
decently
as
a
saloon
passenger
and
been
apologized
to
for
coming
on
board
i
suppose
suggested
the
captain
it
would
have
been
amiss
was
the
reply
the
captain
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
him
thoughtfully
i
ca
think
what
the
matter
with
you
jem
he
said
ordinary
decent
ideas
that
all
said
his
son
scathingly
there
something
more
in
it
than
that
said
the
other
positively
i
do
like
to
see
this
business
with
you
jem
it
ai
natural
to
you
has
your
health
been
all
right
while
i
been
away
of
course
it
has
said
his
son
curtly
if
you
did
want
captain
nugent
aboard
with
you
why
did
you
put
him
ashore
it
would
have
delayed
you
long
think
of
the
worry
and
anxiety
you
caused
poor
mrs
kingdom
a
holiday
for
her
growled
the
captain
it
has
affected
her
health
continued
his
son
and
besides
think
of
his
daughter
she
a
girl
and
all
sunwich
is
laughing
over
her
father
mishap
nugent
fell
into
his
own
trap
exclaimed
the
captain
impatiently
and
it
wo
do
that
girl
of
his
any
harm
to
be
taken
down
a
peg
or
two
do
her
good
knock
some
of
the
nonsense
out
of
her
that
not
the
way
to
speak
of
a
lady
said
jem
hotly
the
offended
captain
regarded
him
somewhat
sourly
then
his
face
changed
and
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
before
his
son
with
consternation
depicted
on
every
feature
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
he
said
slowly
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
thinking
anything
of
kate
nugent
why
not
demanded
the
other
defiantly
why
should
i
captain
hardy
whistling
softly
made
no
reply
but
still
stood
eyeing
him
i
thought
there
was
some
other
reason
for
your
consideration
besides
decent
ideas
he
said
at
last
when
did
it
come
on
how
long
have
you
had
it
hardy
in
a
studiously
unfilial
speech
intimated
that
these
pleasantries
were
not
to
his
taste
no
of
course
not
said
the
captain
resuming
his
seat
well
sorry
if
it
serious
jem
but
i
never
dreamt
you
had
any
ideas
in
that
quarter
if
i
had
i
have
given
old
nugent
the
best
bunk
on
the
ship
and
sung
him
to
sleep
myself
has
she
given
you
any
encouragement
do
know
said
jem
who
found
the
conversation
awkward
extraordinary
thing
said
the
captain
shaking
his
head
extraordinary
like
a
play
play
said
his
son
sharply
play
repeated
his
father
firmly
what
is
the
name
of
it
i
saw
it
once
at
newcastle
the
lovers
take
poison
and
die
across
each
chests
because
their
people
wo
let
marry
and
that
reminds
me
i
saw
some
in
the
kitchen
jem
whose
is
it
i
glad
to
be
the
means
of
affording
you
amusement
said
jem
grinding
his
teeth
captain
hardy
regarded
him
affectionately
go
easy
my
lad
he
said
equably
go
easy
if
i
known
it
before
things
would
have
been
different
as
i
did
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
she
a
pretty
girl
and
a
good
one
too
for
all
her
airs
but
i
afraid
she
too
fond
of
her
father
to
overlook
this
that
where
you
made
such
a
mess
of
things
broke
in
his
son
why
on
earth
you
two
old
men
could
easy
said
the
startled
captain
when
you
are
in
the
early
fifties
my
lad
your
ideas
about
age
will
be
more
accurate
besides
nugent
is
seven
or
eight
years
older
than
i
am
what
became
of
him
inquired
jem
he
was
off
the
moment
we
berthed
said
his
father
suppressing
a
smile
i
do
mean
that
he
bolted
he
got
enough
starch
left
in
him
not
to
do
that
but
he
did
trespass
on
our
hospitality
a
moment
longer
than
was
necessary
i
heard
that
he
got
a
passage
home
on
the
columbus
he
knew
the
master
she
sailed
some
time
before
us
for
london
i
thought
he
have
been
home
by
this
it
was
not
until
two
days
later
however
that
the
gossip
in
sunwich
received
a
pleasant
fillip
by
the
arrival
of
the
injured
captain
he
came
down
from
london
by
the
midday
train
and
disdaining
the
privacy
of
a
cab
prepared
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
his
a
weaker
man
would
have
made
a
detour
but
he
held
a
direct
course
and
with
a
curt
nod
to
acquaintances
who
would
have
stopped
him
walked
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
home
tradesmen
ran
to
their
to
see
him
and
smoking
amphibians
lounging
at
street
corners
broke
out
into
sunny
smiles
as
he
passed
he
met
these
annoyances
with
a
set
face
and
a
cold
eye
but
his
views
concerning
children
were
not
improved
by
the
crowd
of
small
creatures
which
fluttered
along
the
road
ahead
of
him
and
hopeful
of
developments
clustered
round
the
gate
as
he
passed
in
illustration
he
met
these
annoyances
with
a
set
face
it
is
the
pride
and
privilege
of
most
returned
wanderers
to
hold
forth
at
great
length
concerning
their
adventures
but
captain
nugent
was
commendably
brief
at
first
he
could
hardly
be
induced
to
speak
of
them
at
all
but
the
necessity
of
contradicting
stories
which
bella
had
gleaned
for
kingdom
from
friends
in
town
proved
too
strong
for
him
he
ground
his
teeth
with
suppressed
fury
as
he
listened
to
some
of
them
the
truth
was
bad
enough
and
his
daughter
sitting
by
his
side
with
her
hand
in
his
was
trembling
with
indignation
poor
father
she
said
tenderly
what
a
time
you
must
have
had
it
wo
bear
thinking
of
said
kingdom
not
to
be
outdone
in
sympathy
he
met
these
annoyances
with
a
set
face
well
do
think
of
it
said
the
captain
shortly
kingdom
sighed
as
though
to
indicate
that
her
feelings
were
not
to
be
suppressed
in
that
simple
fashion
the
anxiety
has
been
very
great
she
said
shaking
her
head
but
everybody
been
very
kind
i
sure
all
our
friends
have
been
most
sympathetic
i
could
go
outside
the
house
without
somebody
stopping
me
and
asking
whether
there
was
any
news
of
you
i
no
idea
you
were
so
popular
even
the
milkman
i
like
some
tea
interrupted
the
captain
roughly
that
is
when
you
have
finished
your
very
interesting
information
kingdom
pursed
her
lips
together
to
suppress
the
words
she
was
afraid
to
utter
and
rang
the
bell
your
master
would
like
some
tea
she
said
primly
as
bella
appeared
he
has
had
a
long
journey
the
captain
started
and
eyed
her
fiercely
kingdom
her
good
temper
quite
restored
by
this
little
retort
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
gazed
at
him
with
renewed
sympathy
we
all
missed
you
very
much
said
kate
softly
but
we
had
no
fears
once
we
knew
that
you
were
at
sea
and
i
suppose
some
of
the
sailors
were
kind
to
you
suggested
the
unfortunate
kingdom
they
are
rough
fellows
but
i
suppose
some
of
them
have
got
their
hearts
in
the
right
place
i
daresay
they
were
sorry
to
see
you
in
such
a
position
the
captain
reply
was
of
a
nature
known
to
kingdom
and
her
circle
as
snapping
one
head
off
he
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
as
bella
brought
in
the
tray
and
accepting
a
cup
of
tea
began
to
discuss
with
his
daughter
the
events
which
had
transpired
in
his
absence
there
is
no
news
interposed
kingdom
during
an
interval
hall
aunt
died
the
other
day
never
heard
of
her
said
the
captain
neither
had
i
till
then
said
his
sister
what
a
lot
of
people
there
are
one
never
hears
of
john
the
captain
stared
at
her
offensively
and
went
on
with
his
meal
a
long
silence
ensued
i
suppose
you
did
get
to
hear
of
the
cable
that
was
sent
said
kingdom
making
another
effort
to
arouse
interest
what
cable
inquired
her
brother
the
one
hardy
sent
to
his
father
about
you
replied
kingdom
the
captain
pushed
his
chair
back
and
stared
her
full
in
the
face
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
his
sister
explained
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
been
speaking
to
young
hardy
exclaimed
the
captain
i
could
hardly
help
doing
so
when
he
came
here
returned
his
sister
with
dignity
he
has
been
very
anxious
about
you
captain
nugent
rose
and
strode
up
and
down
the
room
then
he
stopped
and
glanced
sharply
at
his
daughter
were
you
here
when
he
called
he
demanded
yes
was
the
reply
and
you
you
spoke
to
him
roared
the
captain
i
had
to
be
civil
said
miss
nugent
calmly
i
not
a
her
father
walked
up
and
down
the
room
again
kingdom
terrified
at
the
storm
she
had
evoked
gazed
helplessly
at
her
niece
what
did
he
come
here
for
said
the
captain
miss
nugent
glanced
down
at
her
plate
i
ca
imagine
she
said
demurely
the
first
time
he
came
to
tell
us
what
had
become
of
you
the
captain
stopped
in
his
walk
and
eyed
her
sternly
i
am
very
fortunate
in
my
children
he
said
slowly
one
is
engaged
to
marry
the
daughter
of
the
shadiest
rascal
in
sunwich
and
the
other
and
the
other
said
his
daughter
proudly
as
he
paused
the
other
said
the
captain
as
he
came
round
the
table
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
is
my
dear
and
obedient
daughter
yes
said
miss
nugent
but
that
is
what
you
were
going
to
say
you
need
not
worry
about
me
i
shall
not
do
anything
that
would
displease
you
chapter
xviii
with
a
view
to
avoiding
the
awkwardness
of
a
chance
meeting
with
any
member
of
the
nugent
family
hardy
took
the
sea
road
on
his
way
to
the
office
the
morning
after
the
captain
return
common
sense
told
him
to
leave
matters
for
the
present
to
the
healing
hand
of
time
and
to
cultivate
habits
of
by
no
means
agreeable
to
one
of
his
temperament
despite
himself
his
spirits
rose
as
he
walked
it
was
an
ideal
spring
morning
cool
and
sunny
the
short
turf
by
the
side
of
the
road
was
fragrant
under
his
heel
and
a
light
wind
stirred
the
blueness
of
the
sea
on
the
beach
below
two
grizzled
men
of
restful
habit
were
endeavouring
to
make
an
old
boat
waterproof
with
red
and
green
paint
a
long
figure
approaching
slowly
from
the
opposite
direction
broke
into
a
pleasant
smile
as
he
drew
near
and
quickened
his
pace
to
meet
him
you
out
early
said
hardy
as
the
old
man
stopped
and
turned
with
him
to
be
sir
said
wilks
darkly
out
early
and
late
and
more
often
than
not
getting
my
dinner
out
that
my
life
nowadays
ca
you
let
her
see
that
her
attentions
are
undesirable
inquired
hardy
gravely
ca
you
let
her
see
that
her
attentions
are
undesirable
illustration
you
let
her
see
that
her
attentions
are
undesirable
i
ca
be
rude
to
a
woman
said
the
steward
with
a
melancholy
smile
if
i
could
my
life
would
ha
been
very
different
she
always
stepping
across
to
ask
my
advice
about
teddy
or
something
o
that
sort
all
last
week
she
kept
borrowing
my
so
at
last
by
way
of
letting
see
i
did
like
it
i
went
out
and
bought
one
for
herself
what
the
result
instead
o
being
offended
she
went
out
and
bought
me
a
couple
o
when
i
did
wear
she
pretended
it
was
because
i
did
like
the
colour
and
she
went
and
bought
two
more
i
wearing
one
now
he
shook
his
head
ruefully
and
hardy
glanced
at
a
tie
which
would
have
paled
the
glories
of
a
rainbow
for
some
time
they
walked
along
in
silence
i
going
to
pay
my
respects
to
nugent
this
afternoon
said
wilks
suddenly
ah
said
the
other
i
knew
what
it
be
with
them
two
on
the
same
ship
continued
wilks
i
did
say
nothing
when
you
was
talking
to
miss
kate
but
i
knew
well
enough
ah
said
hardy
again
there
was
no
mistaking
the
significance
of
the
steward
remarks
and
he
found
them
somewhat
galling
it
was
all
very
well
to
make
use
of
his
humble
friend
but
he
had
no
desire
to
discuss
his
matrimonial
projects
with
him
it
a
great
pity
pursued
the
unconscious
wilks
just
as
everything
seemed
to
be
going
on
smoothly
but
while
there
life
that
a
smart
barge
over
there
said
hardy
pointing
it
out
wilks
nodded
i
shall
keep
my
eyes
open
this
afternoon
he
said
reassuringly
and
if
i
get
a
chance
of
putting
in
a
word
it
be
put
in
years
i
sailed
with
the
and
if
there
anybody
knows
his
weak
spots
it
me
he
stopped
as
they
reached
the
town
and
said
he
pressed
the
young
man
hand
sympathetically
and
a
wink
of
intense
artfulness
gave
point
to
his
last
remark
there
always
sam
wilks
cottage
he
said
in
a
husky
whisper
and
if
two
of
friends
to
meet
there
who
be
the
wiser
he
gazed
benevolently
after
the
young
man
retreating
figure
and
continued
his
stroll
his
own
troubles
partly
forgotten
in
the
desire
to
assist
his
friends
it
would
be
a
notable
feat
for
the
humble
steward
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
the
young
people
together
and
thereby
bringing
to
an
end
the
feud
of
a
dozen
years
he
pictured
himself
eventually
as
the
trusted
friend
and
adviser
of
both
families
and
in
one
daring
flight
of
fancy
saw
himself
hobnobbing
with
the
two
captains
over
pipes
and
whisky
neatly
dressed
and
carrying
a
small
offering
of
wallflowers
he
set
out
that
afternoon
to
call
on
his
old
master
giving
as
he
walked
the
last
touches
to
a
little
speech
of
welcome
which
he
had
prepared
during
dinner
it
was
a
happy
effort
albeit
a
trifle
laboured
but
captain
nugent
speech
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
gave
it
no
chance
he
started
the
moment
the
bowing
wilks
entered
the
room
his
voice
rising
gradually
from
low
bitter
tones
to
a
hurricane
note
which
bella
could
hear
in
the
kitchen
without
even
leaving
her
chair
wilks
stood
dazed
and
speechless
before
him
holding
the
wallflowers
in
one
hand
and
his
cap
in
the
other
in
this
attitude
he
listened
to
a
description
of
his
character
drawn
with
the
loving
skill
of
an
artist
whose
whole
heart
was
in
his
work
and
who
seemed
never
tired
of
filling
in
details
if
you
ever
have
the
hardihood
to
come
to
my
house
again
he
concluded
i
break
every
bone
in
your
misshapen
body
get
wilks
turned
and
groped
his
way
to
the
door
then
he
went
a
little
way
back
with
some
idea
of
defending
himself
but
the
door
of
the
room
was
slammed
in
his
face
he
walked
slowly
down
the
path
to
the
road
and
stood
there
for
some
time
in
helpless
bewilderment
in
all
his
sixty
years
of
life
his
feelings
had
never
been
so
outraged
his
cap
was
still
in
his
hand
and
with
a
helpless
gesture
he
put
it
on
and
scattered
his
floral
offering
in
the
road
then
he
made
a
for
the
two
schooners
though
convivial
by
nature
and
ever
free
with
his
money
he
sat
there
drinking
alone
in
silent
misery
men
came
and
went
but
he
still
sat
there
noting
with
mournful
pride
the
attention
caused
by
his
unusual
bearing
to
casual
inquiries
he
shook
his
head
to
more
direct
ones
he
only
sighed
heavily
and
applied
himself
to
his
liquor
curiosity
increased
with
numbers
as
the
day
wore
on
and
the
steward
determined
to
be
miserable
fought
manfully
against
an
cheerfulness
due
to
the
warming
properties
of
the
ale
within
i
you
ai
lost
nobody
sam
said
a
discomfited
inquirer
at
last
wilks
shook
his
head
you
look
as
though
you
lost
a
shilling
and
found
a
pursued
the
other
found
a
what
inquired

wrinkling
his
forehead
a
said
his
friend
who
did
said
wilks
the
other
attempted
to
explain
and
was
ably
assisted
by
two
friends
but
without
avail
the
impression
left
on
wilks
mind
being
that
somebody
had
got
a
shilling
of
his
he
waxed
exceeding
bitter
and
said
that
he
had
been
missing
shillings
for
a
long
time
you
labourin
under
a
mistake
sam
said
the
first
speaker
wilks
laughed
scornfully
and
essayed
a
sneer
while
his
friends
regarding
his
contortions
with
some
anxiety
expressed
a
fear
that
he
was
not
quite
himself
to
this
suggestion
the
steward
deigned
no
reply
and
turning
to
the
landlord
bade
him
replenish
his
mug
you
enough
wilks
said
that
gentleman
who
had
been
watching
him
for
some
time
wilks
gazing
at
him
mistily
did
not
at
first
understand
the
full
purport
of
this
remark
but
when
he
did
his
wrath
was
so
majestic
and
his
remarks
about
the
quality
of
the
brew
so
libellous
that
the
landlord
lost
all
patience
you
get
off
home
he
said
sharply
listen
t
me
said
wilks
impressively
i
do
want
no
words
with
you
said
the
you
get
off
home
while
you
can
that
right
sam
said
one
of
the
company
putting
his
hand
on
the
steward
arm
you
take
his
advice
wilks
shook
the
hand
off
and
eyed
his
adviser
ferociously
then
he
took
a
glass
from
the
counter
and
smashed
it
on
the
floor
the
next
moment
the
bar
was
in
a
ferment
and
the
landlord
gripping
wilks
round
the
middle
skilfully
piloted
him
to
the
door
and
thrust
him
into
the
road
illustration
he
took
a
glass
from
the
counter
and
smashed
it
on
the
floor
the
strong
air
blowing
from
the
sea
disordered
the
steward
faculties
still
further
his
treatment
inside
was
forgotten
and
leaning
against
the
front
of
the
tavern
he
stood
gazing
at
marvels
ships
in
the
harbour
suddenly
quitted
their
native
element
and
were
drawn
up
into
the
firmament
nobody
passed
but
twins
evening
wilks
said
a
voice
the
steward
peered
down
at
the
voice
at
first
he
thought
it
was
another
case
of
twins
but
looking
close
he
saw
that
it
was
edward
silk
alone
he
saluted
him
graciously
and
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
sky
sought
to
attract
his
attention
to
the
ships
there
yes
said
the
unconscious
mr
silk
sign
of
a
fine
day
are
you
going
my
way
wilks
smiled
and
detaching
himself
from
the
tavern
with
some
difficulty
just
saved
mr
silk
from
a
terrible
fall
by
clutching
him
forcibly
round
the
neck
the
ingratitude
of
mr
silk
was
a
rebuff
to
a
nature
which
was
at
that
moment
overflowing
with
good
will
for
a
moment
the
steward
was
half
inclined
to
let
him
go
home
alone
but
the
reflection
that
he
would
never
get
there
softened
him
pull
yourself
he
said
gravely
now
on
me
the
road
as
they
walked
rose
up
in
imitation
of
the
shipping
but
wilks
knew
now
the
explanation
teddy
silk
was
intoxicated
very
gently
he
leaned
towards
the
erring
youth
and
wagged
his
head
at
him
are
you
going
to
hold
up
or
are
you
demanded
mr
silk
shortly
the
steward
waived
the
question
he
knew
from
experience
the
futility
of
arguing
with
men
in
drink
the
great
thing
was
to
get
teddy
silk
home
not
to
argue
with
him
he
smiled
to
himself
and
with
a
sudden
movement
pinned
him
up
against
the
wall
in
time
to
arrest
fall
illustration
the
great
thing
was
to
get
teddy
silk
home
with
frequent
halts
by
the
way
during
which
the
shortness
of
mr
temper
furnished
wilks
with
the
texts
of
several
sermons
none
of
which
he
finished
they
at
last
reached
fullalove
alley
and
the
steward
with
a
brief
exhortation
to
his
charge
to
hold
his
head
up
bore
down
on
mrs
silk
who
was
sitting
in
her
doorway
i
brought

said
steadying
himself
against
the
doorpost
brought

the
bewildered
mrs
silk
don
say
anything
to
entreated
wilks
my
sake
thing
might
anybody
he
been
like
that
all
the
way
said
mr
silk
regarding
the
steward
with
much
disfavour
i
do
know
why
i
troubled
about
him
i
sure
crowd
roun
pursued
the
imaginative
wilks
up
teddy
i
sure
it
very
kind
of
you
wilks
said
the
widow
as
she
glanced
at
a
little
knot
of
neighbours
standing
near
will
you
come
inside
for
a
minute
or
two
she
moved
the
chair
to
let
him
pass
and
wilks
still
keeping
the
restraining
hand
of
age
on
the
shoulder
of
intemperate
youth
passed
in
and
stood
smiling
amiably
while
mrs
silk
lit
the
lamp
and
placed
it
in
the
centre
of
the
table
which
was
laid
for
supper
the
light
shone
on
a
knuckle
of
boiled
pork
a
loaf
and
a
wedge
of
cheese
i
suppose
you
wo
stay
and
pick
a
bit
o
with
us
said
mrs
silk
why
not
inquired
wilks
i
sure
if
i
had
known
said
mrs
silk
as
she
piloted
him
to
a
seat
i
something
nice
there
now
if
i
been
and
forgot
the
beer
she
left
the
table
and
went
into
the
kitchen
and
wilks
eyes
glistened
as
she
returned
with
a
large
brown
jug
full
of
foaming
ale
and
filled
his
glass
teddy
must
any
he
said
sharply
as
she
prepared
to
fill
that
gentleman
glass
just
a
glass
she
said
winsomely
not
a
drop
said
wilks
firmly
mrs
silk
hesitated
and
screwing
up
her
forehead
glanced
significantly
at
her
son
some
she
whispered
give
me
the
jug
said
mr
silk
indignantly
what
are
you
listening
to
for
ca
you
see
what
the
matter
with
not
to
it
said
wilks
put
it
he
thumped
the
table
emphatically
with
his
hand
and
before
her
indignant
son
could
interfere
mrs
silk
had
obeyed
it
was
the
last
straw
edward
silk
rose
to
his
feet
with
tremendous
effect
and
first
thrusting
his
plate
violently
away
from
him
went
out
into
the
night
slamming
the
door
behind
him
with
such
violence
that
the
startled
wilks
was
nearly
blown
out
of
his
chair
he
do
mean
nothing
said
mrs
silk
turning
a
rather
scared
face
to
the
steward
a
bit
jealous
of
you
i
wilks
shook
his
head
truth
to
tell
he
was
rather
at
a
loss
to
know
exactly
what
had
happened
and
then
there
love
affair
sighed
mrs
silk
he
never
get
over
the
loss
of
amelia
kybird
i
always
know
when
seen
her
that
miserable
there
no
getting
a
word
out
of
wilks
smiled
vaguely
and
went
on
with
his
supper
and
the
meal
finished
allowed
himself
to
be
installed
in
an
while
his
hostess
cleared
the
table
he
sat
and
smoked
in
high
good
humour
with
himself
the
occasional
remarks
he
made
being
received
with
an
enthusiasm
which
they
seldom
provoked
elsewhere
i
should
like
t
sit
all
night
he
said
at
last
i
do
believe
it
said
mrs
silk
playfully
like
t
sit
all
night
repeated
wilks
somewhat
sternly
all
nex
day
all
day
after
day
after
that
day
mrs
silk
eyed
him
softly
why
would
you
like
to
sit
here
all
that
time
she
inquired
in
a
low
voice
said
wilks
simply
i
do
feel
if
i
can
stand
he
closed
his
eyes
on
the
indignant
mrs
silk
and
fell
fast
asleep
it
was
a
sound
sleep
and
dreamless
and
only
troubled
by
the
occasional
ineffectual
attempts
of
his
hostess
to
arouse
him
she
gave
up
the
attempt
at
last
and
taking
up
a
pair
of
socks
sat
working
thoughtfully
the
other
side
of
the
the
steward
awoke
an
hour
or
two
later
and
after
what
seemed
a
terrible
struggle
found
himself
standing
at
the
open
door
with
the
cold
night
air
blowing
in
his
face
and
a
voice
which
by
an
effort
of
memory
he
identified
as
that
of
edward
silk
inviting
him
to
go
home
and
lose
no
time
about
it
then
the
door
slammed
behind
him
and
he
stood
balancing
himself
with
some
difficulty
on
the
step
wondering
what
had
happened
by
the
time
he
had
walked
up
and
down
the
deserted
alley
three
or
four
times
light
was
vouchsafed
to
him
and
shivering
slightly
he
found
his
own
door
and
went
to
bed
chapter
xix
any
hopes
which
hardy
might
have
entertained
as
to
the
attitude
of
miss
nugent
were
dispelled
the
first
time
he
saw
her
that
dutiful
daughter
of
a
sire
favouring
him
with
a
bow
which
was
exactly
half
an
inch
in
depth
and
then
promptly
bestowing
her
gaze
elsewhere
he
passed
captain
nugent
next
day
and
for
a
week
afterwards
he
had
only
to
close
his
eyes
to
see
in
all
its
appalling
virulence
the
glare
with
which
that
gentleman
had
acknowledged
his
attempt
at
recognition

captain
nugent
he
fared
no
better
in
fullalove
alley
a
visit
to
wilks
eliciting
the
fact
that
that
delectable
thoroughfare
had
been
put
out
of
bounds
for
miss
nugent
moreover
wilks
was
full
of
his
own
troubles
and
anxious
for
any
comfort
and
advice
that
could
be
given
to
him
all
the
alley
knew
that
mrs
silk
had
quarrelled
with
her
son
over
the
steward
and
without
knowing
the
facts
spoke
their
mind
with
painful
freedom
concerning
them
she
and
teddy
do
speak
to
each
other
now
said
wilks
gloomily
and
to
people
talk
you
think
it
was
my
fault
hardy
gave
him
what
comfort
he
could
he
even
went
the
length
of
saying
that
mrs
silk
was
a
fine
woman
she
acts
like
a
suffering
martyr
exclaimed
wilks
she
comes
over
dropping
hints
that
people
are
talking
about
us
and
that
they
ask
awkward
questions
pretending
to
misunderstand
every
time
is
enough
to
send
me
crazy
and
she
so
sudden
in
what
she
says
there
no
being
up
to
this
morning
she
asked
me
if
i
should
be
sorry
if
she
died
what
did
you
say
inquired
his
listener
i
said
admitted
wilks
reluctantly
i
could
say
anything
else
but
i
said
that
she
was
to
let
my
feelings
interfere

in
any
way

sailed
a
day
or
two
later
and
after
that
nothing
happened
equator

was
an
impregnable
fortress
and
the
only
member
of
the
garrison
he
saw
in
a
fortnight
was
bella
his
depression
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
his
partner
who
after
first
advising
and
then
a
visit
to
a
specialist
for
diseases
of
the
heart
finally
recommended
more
work
and
put
a
generous
portion
of
his
own
on
to
the
young
man
desk
hardy
who
was
in
an
evil
temper
pitched
it
on
to
the
floor
and
with
a
few
incisive
remarks
on
levity
unbecoming
to
age
pursued
his
duties
in
gloomy
silence
a
short
time
afterwards
however
he
had
to
grapple
with
his
work
in
real
earnest
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
genial
shipbroker
was
laid
up
with
a
rather
serious
illness
a
chill
caught
while
bathing
was
going
the
round
of
certain
unsuspected
weak
spots
and
the
patient
who
was
of
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
was
taking
a
greater
interest
in
medical
works
than
his
doctor
deemed
advisable
most
interesting
study
he
said
faintly
to
hardy
as
the
latter
sat
by
his
bedside
one
evening
and
tried
to
cheer
him
in
the
usual
way
by
telling
him
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
him
there
are
dozens
of
different
forms
of
liver
complaint
alone
and
i
got
all
liver
is
much
said
his
visitor
with
the
confidence
of
youth
mine
is
retorted
the
invalid
it
twice
its
proper
size
and
still
growing
base
of
the
left
lung
is
solidifying
or
i
much
mistaken
the
heart
instead
of
waltzing
as
is
suitable
to
my
time
of
life
is
doing
a
galop
and
everything
else
is
as
wrong
as
it
can
be
when
are
you
coming
back
inquired
the
other
back
repeated
swann
back
you
have
been
listening
i
a
wreck
all
through
violating
man
primeval
instinct
by
messing
about
in
cold
water
what
is
the
news
hardy
pondered
and
shook
his
head
nugent
is
going
to
be
married
in
july
he
said
at
last
he
better
have
had
that
trip
on
the
whaler
commented
swann
but
that
is
not
news
nathan
smith
told
it
me
this
morning
nathan
smith
repeated
the
other
in
surprise
i
done
him
a
little
service
said
the
invalid
got
him
out
of
a
mess
with
garth
and
co
he
been
here
two
or
three
times
and
i
must
confess
i
find
him
a
most
alluring
rascal
birds
of
a
feather
began
hardy
superciliously
do
flatter
me
said
swann
putting
his
hand
out
of
the
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
i
am
not
worthy
to
sit
at
his
feet
he
is
the
most
amusing
knave
on
the
coast
he
is
like
a
sunbeam
in
a
sick
room
when
you
can
once
get
him
to
talk
of
his
experiences
have
you
seen
young
nugent
lately
does
he
seem
cheerful
yes
but
he
is
not
was
the
reply
well
it
natural
for
the
young
to
marry
said
the
other
gravely
murchison
will
be
the
next
to
go
i
expect
possibly
returned
hardy
with
affected
calmness
blaikie
was
saying
something
about
it
this
morning
resumed
swann
regarding
him
from
lids
but
he
was
punching
and
tapping
me
all
about
the
ribs
while
he
was
talking
and
i
did
catch
all
he
said
but
i
think
it
all
arranged
murchison
is
there
nearly
every
day
i
understand
i
suppose
you
meet
him
there
hardy
whistling
softly
rose
and
walked
round
the
room
uncorking
medicine
bottles
and
sniffing
at
their
contents
a
smile
of
unaffected
pleasure
lit
up
his
features
as
he
removed
the
stopper
from
one
particularly
pungent
mixture
illustration
sniffing
at
their
contents
two
tablespoonfuls
three
times
a
day
he
read
slowly
when
did
you
have
the
last
swann
shall
i
ring
for
the
nurse
the
invalid
shook
his
head
impatiently
you
an
ungrateful
dog
he
muttered
or
you
would
tell
me
how
your
affair
is
going
have
you
got
any
chance
you
getting
now
said
hardy
calmly
i
better
go
all
right
go
then
responded
the
invalid
but
if
you
lose
that
girl
just
for
the
want
of
a
little
skilled
advice
from
an
expert
you
never
forgive
yourself
i
serious
well
you
must
be
ill
then
said
the
younger
man
with
anxiety
twice
said
swann
lying
on
his
back
and
apparently
addressing
the
ceiling
twice
i
have
given
this
young
man
invaluable
assistance
and
each
time
he
has
bungled
hardy
laughed
and
the
nurse
returning
to
the
room
bade
him
and
departed
after
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
sick
room
the
air
was
delicious
and
he
walked
along
slowly
deep
in
thought
from
nathan
smith
his
thoughts
wandered
to
jack
nugent
and
his
unfortunate
engagement
and
from
that
to
kate
nugent
for
months
he
had
been
revolving
impossible
schemes
in
his
mind
to
earn
her
gratitude
and
possibly
that
of
the
captain
by
extricating
jack
in
the
latter
connection
he
was
also
reminded
of
that
unhappy
victim
of
unrequited
affection
edward
silk
it
was
early
to
go
indoors
and
the
house
was
dull
he
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
and
his
thoughts
reverting
to
his
sick
partner
smiled
as
he
remembered
remarks
which
that
irresponsible
person
had
made
at
various
times
concerning
the
making
of
his
last
will
and
testament
then
he
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
as
a
wild
kind
of
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
him
he
stood
for
some
time
thinking
then
walked
a
little
way
and
then
stopped
again
as
various
difficulties
presented
themselves
for
solution
finally
despite
the
lateness
of
the
hour
he
walked
back
in
some
excitement
to
the
house
he
had
quitted
over
half
an
hour
before
with
the
intention
of
speaking
to
the
invalid
concerning
a
duty
peculiarly
incumbent
upon
elderly
men
of
means
the
nurse
who
came
out
of
the
sick
room
gently
closing
the
door
after
her
demurred
a
little
to
this
second
visit
but
receiving
a
promise
from
the
visitor
not
to
excite
the
invalid
left
them
together
the
odour
of
the
abominable
physic
was
upon
the
air
well
said
the
invalid
i
have
been
thinking
that
i
was
rather
uncivil
a
little
while
ago
said
hardy
ah
said
the
other
what
do
you
want
a
little
of
that
skilled
assistance
you
were
speaking
of
swann
made
an
alarming
noise
in
his
throat
hardy
sprang
forward
in
alarm
but
he
motioned
him
back
i
was
only
laughing
he
explained
hardy
repressed
his
annoyance
by
an
effort
and
endeavoured
but
with
scant
success
to
return
the
other
smile
go
on
said
the
shipbroker
presently
i
have
thought
of
a
scheme
for
upsetting
nugent
marriage
said
hardy
slowly
it
is
just
a
forlorn
hope
which
depends
for
its
success
on
you
and
nathan
smith
he
a
friend
of
kybird
said
the
other
drily
that
is
the
most
important
thing
of
all
rejoined
hardy
that
is
next
to
your
shrewdness
and
tact
everything
depends
upon
you
really
and
whether
you
can
fool
smith
it
is
a
great
thing
in
our
favour
that
you
have
been
taking
him
up
lately
are
you
coming
to
the
point
or
are
you
not
demanded
the
shipbroker
hardy
looked
cautiously
round
the
room
and
then
drawing
his
chair
close
to
the
bed
leaned
over
the
prostrate
man
and
spoke
rapidly
into
his
ear
what
cried
the
astounded
swann
suddenly
sitting
up
in
his
bed
you
you
scoundrel
it
to
be
done
said
hardy
you
ghoul
said
the
invalid
glaring
at
him
is
that
the
way
to
talk
to
a
sick
man
you
unscrupulous
rascal
it
be
amusement
for
you
pleaded
the
other
and
if
we
are
successful
it
will
be
the
best
thing
in
the
end
for
everybody
think
of
the
good
you
do
where
you
get
such
rascally
ideas
from
i
ca
think
mused
the
invalid
your
father
is
a
straightforward
honest
man
and
your
partner
uprightness
is
the
talk
of
sunwich
it
does
take
much
to
make
sunwich
talk
retorted
hardy
a
preposterous
suggestion
to
make
to
a
man
of
my
standing
said
the
shipbroker
ignoring
the
remark
if
the
affair
ever
leaked
out
i
should
never
hear
the
end
of
it
it
ca
leak
out
said
hardy
and
if
it
does
there
is
no
direct
evidence
they
will
never
really
know
until
you
die
they
can
only
suspect
very
well
said
the
shipbroker
with
a
glance
anything
to
get
rid
of
you
it
a
scheme
and
could
only
originate
with
a
young
man
whose
affections
have
weakened
his
head
i
consent
bravo
said
hardy
and
patted
him
on
the
back
swann
referred
to
the
base
of
his
left
lung
and
he
apologized
i
have
to
fix
it
up
with
blaikie
said
the
invalid
lying
down
again
murchison
got
two
of
his
best
patients
last
week
so
that
it
ought
to
be
easy
and
besides
he
is
fond
of
innocent
amusement
i
awfully
obliged
to
you
said
hardy
it
might
be
as
well
if
we
pretended
to
quarrel
said
the
invalid
reflectively
especially
as
you
are
known
to
be
a
friend
of
nugent
we
have
a
few
words
before
my
housekeeper
if
possible
to
insure
publicity
and
then
you
had
better
not
come
again
send
silk
instead
with
messages
hardy
thanked
him
and
whispered
a
caution
as
a
footstep
was
heard
on
the
landing
the
door
opened
and
the
nurse
followed
by
the
housekeeper
bearing
a
tray
entered
the
room
and
i
ca
be
worried
about
these
things
said
swann
in
an
acrimonious
voice
as
they
entered
if
you
are
not
capable
of
settling
a
simple
question
like
that
yourself
ask
the
to
instruct
you
it
your
work
retorted
hardy
and
a
nice
mess
it
in
said
the
nurse
coming
forward
hastily
you
must
leave
the
room

i
ca
have
you
exciting
my
patient
hardy
bestowed
an
indignant
glance
at
the

out

extraordinary
fierceness

wo

this
person
admitted
to
my
room
yes
yes
certainly
said
the
nurse
you
must
go
sir
at
once
please
i
going
said
hardy
almost
losing
his
gravity
at
the
piteous
spectacle
afforded
by
the
as
she
stood
still
holding
the
tray
and
staring
at
the
combatants
when
you
tired
of
skulking
in
bed
perhaps
you
come
and
do
your
share
of
the
work
swann
rose
to
a
sitting
position
and
his
demeanour
was
so
alarming
that
the
nurse
hastening
over
to
him
entreated
him
to
lie
down
and
waved
hardy
peremptorily
from
the
room

the
invalid

great
relish

said
the
invalid
he
gazed
fixedly
at
the
young
man
as
he
departed
and
then
catching
sight
in
his
turn
of
the
housekeeper
perplexity
laid
himself
down
and
buried
his
face
in
the
the
nurse
crossed
over
to
her
assistant
and
taking
the
tray
from
her
told
her
in
a
sharp
whisper
that
if
she
ever
admitted
hardy
again
she
would
not
be
answerable
for
the
consequences

began
to
cast
longing
glances
at

he
reminded
himself
that
the
labourer
was
worthy
of
his
hire
and
it
seemed
moreover
an
extremely
desirable
thing
that
captain
nugent
should
know
that
he

heard
the

swing
behind
him

he
entered
the

looked
up
and
stood
spellbound
at
his
audacity
as
a
fairly
courageous
young
person
she
was
naturally
an
admirer
of
boldness
in
others
but
this
seemed
sheer
recklessness
moreover
it
was
recklessness
in
which
if
she
stayed
where
she
was
she
would
have
to
bear
a
part
or
be
guilty
of
rudeness
of
which
she
felt
incapable
she
took
a
third
course
and
raising
her
eyebrows
at
the
unnecessarily
loud
knocking
with
which
the
young
man
announced
his
arrival
retreated
in
good
order
into
the
garden
where
her
father
in
a
somewhat
heated
condition
was
laboriously
planting
geraniums
she
had
barely
reached
him

sharply
as
he
straightened
his
aching
back
young
hardy
said
bella
impressively
i
showed
in
i
ask
to
take
a
chair
but
he
took
one
young

to
see
me
said
the
captain
to
his
daughter
after
bella
had
returned
to
the
house
how
dare
he
come

my
house

wo

shall
i
go
in
and
see
him
for
you

you
stay

you

him
speak

you
i
wo
have
him
look

he
beat
his
dirty
hands
together
and
strode
off
towards
the
house
jem
hardy
rose
from
his
chair
as
the
captain
entered
the
room
and
ignoring
a
look
of
black
inquiry
bade
him
good
afternoon
what
do
you
want
asked
the
captain
gruffly
as
he
stared
him
straight
in
the
eye
i
came
to
see
you
about
your
son
marriage
said
the
other
are
you
still
desirous
of
preventing
it
i
sorry
you
had
the
trouble
said
the
captain
in
a
voice
of
suppressed
anger
and
now
may
i
ask
you
to
get
out
of
my
house
hardy
bowed
i
am
sorry
i
have
troubled
you
he
said
calmly
but
i
have
a
plan
which
i
think
would
get
your
son
out
of
this
affair
and
as
a
business
man
i
wanted
to
make
something
out
of
it
the
captain
eyed
him
scornfully
but
he
was
glad
to
see
this
successful
son
of
his
old
enemy
tainted
with
such
sordid
views
instead
of
turning
him
out
he
spoke
to
him
almost
fairly
how
much
do
you
want
he
inquired
all
things
considered
i
am
asking
a
good
deal
was
the
reply
how
much
repeated
the
captain
impatiently
hardy
hesitated
in
exchange
for
the
service
i
want
permission
to
visit
here
when
i
choose
he
said
at
length
say
twice
a
week
words
failed
the
captain
none
with
which
he
was
acquainted
seemed
forcible
enough
for
the
occasion
he
faced
his
visitor
stuttering
with
rage
and
pointed
to
the
door
get
out
of
my
house
he
roared

out
of
my
house
he
roared
i
sorry
to
have
intruded
said
hardy
as
he
crossed
the
room
and
paused
at
the
door
it
is
none
of
my
business
of
course
i
thought
that
i
saw
an
opportunity
of
doing
your
son
a
good
turn
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
at
the
same
time
paying
off
old
scores
against
kybird
and
nathan
smith
i
thought
that
on
that
account
it
might
suit
you
good
afternoon
he
walked
out
into
the
hall
and
reaching
the
front
door
fumbled
clumsily
with
the
catch
the
captain
watching
his
efforts
in
grim
silence
began
to
experience
the
twin
promptings
of
curiosity
and
temptation
what
is
this
wonderful
plan
of
yours
he
demanded
with
a
sneer
just
at
present
that
must
remain
a
secret
said
the
other
he
came
from
the
door
and
unbidden
followed
the
captain
into
the
room
again
what
do
you
want
to
visit
at
my
house
for
inquired
the
latter
in
a
forbidding
voice
to
see
your
daughter
said
hardy
the
captain
had
a
relapse
he
had
not
expected
a
truthful
answer
and
when
it
came
in
the
most
tone
it
found
him
quite
unprepared
his
first
idea
was
to
sacrifice
his
dignity
and
forcibly
eject
his
visitor
but
more
sensible
thoughts
prevailed
you
are
quite
sure
i
suppose
that
your
visits
would
be
agreeable
to
my
daughter
he
said
contemptuously
hardy
shook
his
head
i
should
come
ostensibly
to
see
you
he
said
cheerfully
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
you
smoke
stuttered
the
captain
explosively
smoke
a
pipe
with
me
why
not
said
the
other
i
am
offering
you
my
services
and
anything
that
is
worth
having
is
worth
paying
for
i
suppose
we
could
both
smoke
pipes
under
pleasanter
conditions
what
have
you
got
against
me
it
is
my
fault
that
you
and
my
father
have
quarrelled
i
do
want
anything
more
to
say
to
you
said
the
captain
sternly
i
shown
you
the
door
once
am
i
to
take
forcible
measures
hardy
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
i
am
sorry
he
said
moving
to
the
door
again
so
am
i
said
the
other
it
a
pity
said
hardy
regretfully
it
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
i
had
set
my
heart
on
fooling
kybird
and
smith
and
now
all
my
trouble
is
wasted
nathan
smith
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
fall
the
captain
hesitated
his
visitor
seemed
to
be
confident
and
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
prevent
his
son
marriage
and
a
great
deal
to
repay
some
portion
of
his
debt
to
the
ingenious
smith
moreover
there
seemed
to
be
an
excellent
opportunity
of
punishing
the
presumption
of
his
visitor
by
taking
him
at
his
word
i
do
think
you
enjoy
your
smoking
here
much
he
said
curtly
i
take
my
chance
of
that
said
the
other
it
will
only
be
a
matter
of
a
few
weeks
and
then
if
i
am
unsuccessful
my
visits
cease
and
if
you
successful
am
i
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
for
the
rest
of
my
life
demanded
the
captain
that
will
be
for
you
to
decide
was
the
reply
is
it
a
bargain
the
captain
looked
at
him
and
deliberated
all
right
mondays
and
thursdays
he
said
laconically
hardy
saw
through
the
ruse
and
countered
now
swann
is
ill
i
ca
always
get
away
when
i
wish
he
said
easily
i
just
drop
in
when
i
can
good
day
he
opened
the
door
and
fearful
lest
the
other
should
alter
his
mind
at
the
last
moment
walked
briskly
down
the
path
to
the
gate
the
captain
stood
for
some
time
after
his
departure
deep
in
thought
and
then
returned
to
the
garden
to
be
skilfully
catechized
by
miss
nugent
and
when
my
young
friend
comes
with
his
pipe
you
be
in
another
room
he
concluded
warningly
miss
nugent
looked
up
and
patted
his
cheek
tenderly
what
a
talent
for
organization
you
have
she
remarked
softly
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
the
idea
of
his
taking
such
a
fancy
to
you
the
captain
coughed
and
eyed
her
suspiciously
he
had
been
careful
not
to
tell
her
hardy
reasons
for
coming
but
he
had
a
shrewd
idea
that
his
caution
was
wasted
today
is
thursday
said
kate
slowly
he
will
be
here
and
saturday
what
shall
i
wear
the
captain
resumed
his
gardening
operations
by
no
means
perturbed
at
the
prophecy
much
as
he
disliked
the
young
man
he
gave
him
credit
for
a
certain
amount
of
decency
and
his
indignation
was
proportionately
great
the
following
evening
when
bella
announced
hardy
he
made
a
genial
remark
about
shylock
and
a
pound
of
flesh
but
finding
that
it
was
only
an
excellent
conversational
opening
the
subject
of
shakespeare
plays
lapsed
into
silence
it
was
an
absurd
situation
but
he
was
host
and
hardy
allowed
him
to
see
pretty
plainly
that
he
was
a
guest
he
answered
the
latter
remarks
with
a
very
ill
grace
and
took
covert
stock
of
him
as
one
of
a
species
he
had
not
encountered
before
one
result
of
his
was
that
he
was
spared
any
feeling
of
surprise
when
his
visitor
came
the
following
evening
it
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
said
miss
nugent
who
came
into
the
room
after
hardy
had
departed
you
do
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
eh
said
her
father
sharply
i
mean
that
you
are
not
such
a
judge
of
character
as
i
am
said
kate
and
besides
i
have
made
a
special
study
of
young
men
the
only
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
why
you
should
have
such
an
extraordinary
fascination
for
him
you
talk
too
much
miss
said
the
captain
drawing
the
tobacco
jar
towards
him
and
slowly
filling
his
pipe
miss
nugent
sighed
and
after
striking
a
match
for
him
took
a
seat
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
placed
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
can
quite
understand
him
liking
you
she
said
slowly
the
captain
grunted
and
if
he
is
like
other
sensible
people
continued
miss
nugent
in
a
coaxing
voice
the
more
he
sees
of
you
the
more
he
like
you
i
do
hope
he
has
not
come
to
take
you
away
from
me
illustration
i
do
hope

the
indignant
captain
edged
her
off
the
side
of
his
chair
miss
nugent
quite
undisturbed
got
on
again
and
sat
tapping
the
floor
with
her
foot
her
arm
stole
round
his
neck
and
she
laid
her
cheek
against
his
head
and
smiled
wickedly
is
he
she
said
in
a
careless
voice
i
do
know
anything
about
his
looks
growled
her
father
miss
nugent
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
surprise
first
thing
i
noticed
she
said
with
commendable
gravity
he
very
and
very
determined
what
are
you
going
to
give
him
if
he
gets
poor
jack
out
of
this
miserable
business
give
him
said
her
father
staring
i
met
jack
yesterday
said
kate
and
i
can
see
that
he
is
as
wretched
as
he
can
be
he
would
say
so
of
course
if
hardy
is
successful
you
ought
to
recognize
it
i
should
suggest
one
of
your
new
photos
in
an
eighteenpenny
frame
she
slipped
off
the
chair
and
quitted
the
room
before
her
father
could
think
of
a
suitable
retort
and
he
sat
smoking
silently
until
the
entrance
of
kingdom
a
few
minutes
later
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
working
off
a
little
accumulated
gall
while
the
junior
partner
was
thus
trying
to
obtain
a
footing
at
equator
lodge
the
gravest
rumours
of
the
senior
partner
health
were
prevalent
in
the
town
nathan
smith
who
had
been
to
see
him
again
ostensibly
to
thank
him
for
his
efforts
on
his
behalf
was
of
opinion
that
he
was
breaking
up
and
in
conversation
with
kybird
shook
his
head
over
the
idea
that
there
would
soon
be
one
gentleman
the
less
in
a
world
which
was
none
too
full
of
them
we
all
got
to
go
some
day
observed
kybird
philosophically
that
cough
o
yours
getting
on
nat
smith
met
the
pleasantry
coldly
the
ailment
referred
to
was
one
of
some
standing
and
had
been
a
continual
source
of
expense
in
the
way
of
balsams
and
other
remedies
he
worried
about
money
he
said
referring
to
swann
ah
we
that
worry
said
kybird
nobody
to
leave
it
to
continued
smith
seems
a
bit
it
if
somebody
to
leave
it
to
would
so
much
to
leave
observed
kybird
sagely
it
a
rum
world
he
shook
his
head
over
it
and
went
on
with
the
uncongenial
task
of
marking
down
wares
which
had
suffered
by
being
exposed
outside
too
long
smith
who
always
took
an
interest
in
the
welfare
of
his
friends
made
suggestions
i
should
put
a
ticket
marked
at
this
on
that
coat
he
said
severely
it
ought
to
be
looked
at
it
the
best
out
o
three
all
together
said
kybird
evenly
and
look
said
smith
look
what
an
place
you
put
this
ticket
why
not
put
it
higher
up
on
the
coat
becos
the
ai
there
said
kybird
smith
apologized
and
watched
his
friend
without
further
criticism
gettin
ready
for
the
wedding
i
he
said
presently
kybird
assented
and
his
brow
darkened
as
he
spoke
of
surreptitious
raids
on
his
stores
made
by
kybird
and
daughter
their
idea
of
a
wedding
he
said
bitterly
is
to
dress
up
and
make
a
show
my
idea
is
a
few
real
good
old
pals
and
plenty
of
licker
you
to
both
observed
nathan
smith
whose
knowledge
of
the
sex
was
pretty
accurate
kybird
nodded
gloomily
and
jack
do
seem
to
been
it
off
partikler
well
lately
he
said
slowly
he
getting
more
uppish
than
wot
was
when
come
here
first
but
i
got
to
promise
that
he
settle
any
money
that
might
ever
get
left
him
on
smith
inscrutable
eyes
glistened
into
something
as
nearly
approaching
a
twinkle
as
they
were
capable
that
settle
the
five
he
said
warmly
are
you
goin
to
send
nugent
an
invite
for
the
wedding
illustration
are
you
goin
to
send
nugent
an
invite
for
the
wedding
they
to
be
asked
o
course
said
kybird
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
rendered
necessary
by
a
certain
lightness
in
his
manner
the
old
woman
do
like
the
nugent
lot
but
she
do
the
proper
thing
o
course
she
will
said
smith
soothingly
come
over
and
a
drink
with
me
it
your
turn
to
stand
