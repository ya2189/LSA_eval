the
genesis
of
the
experiment
after
years
of
waiting
for
time
and
place
and
person
the
rev
walter
drury
an
average
methodist
preacher
was
ready
to
begin
his
experiment
the
process
of
getting
adjusted
to
its
conditions
was
ended
he
believed
that
if
he
had
health
and
nothing
happened
to
his
mind
he
might
count
on
at
least
eight
years
more
at
first
church
delafield
a
pastorate
is
nothing
wonderful
in
methodism
the
right
preacher
makes
his
own
time
limit
he
would
not
think
himself
too
good
for
delafield
but
neither
did
he
rate
himself
too
low
he
just
felt
that
he
was
reasonably
secure
against
promotion
and
that
he
need
not
be
afraid
of
demotion
there
are
such
men
they
are
a
boon
to
bishops
the
unforeseen
was
to
be
reckoned
with
of
course
the
possible
shattering
of
all
his
plans
by
some
unimagined
misfortune
but
the
man
who
waits
until
he
is
secure
against
the
unknown
never
discovers
anything
not
even
himself
walter
drury
had
at
last
found
his
man
or
rather
his
boy
here
in
delafield
it
was
necessary
to
the
experiment
that
its
subject
should
be
a
decent
young
fellow
not
particularly
keen
on
formal
religion
but
well
in
body
and
mind
clean
straight
and
able
to
use
the
brains
he
had
when
need
arose
john
wesley
was
such
a
boy
would
the
result
be
worth
what
he
was
putting
into
the
venture
that
would
depend
on
one
standards
the
church
does
doubt
that
the
more
than
twice
ten
years
experiment
of
helms
in
the
south
end
of
boston
has
been
worth
the
price
and
helms
has
for
company
a
few
pioneers
in
other
fields
who
will
tell
you
they
have
drawn
good
pay
in
the
outcomes
of
their
patience
still
walter
drury
was
a
new
sort
of
specialist
the
thing
he
had
in
mind
to
do
had
been
almost
tried
a
thousand
times
a
thousand
times
it
had
been
begun
but
so
far
as
he
knew
no
one
preacher
had
thought
to
focus
every
possible
influence
on
a
single
life
through
a
full
cycle
of
change
he
meant
his
work
to
be
intensive
not
in
degree
only
but
in
duration
at
the
end
of
ten
years
if
then
he
had
not
shown
in
results
beyond
question
the
direction
of
the
church
next
great
advance
at
least
he
would
have
had
the
measureless
joy
of
the
effort
no
seeming
failure
could
rob
him
of
his
reward
now
do
not
image
this
preacher
as
a
dreaming
scattergood
he
would
do
as
much
as
any
man
should
that
is
to
say
his
utmost
in
his
pulpit
and
his
parish
the
experiment
should
be
no
robbing
of
collective
peter
to
pay
individual
paul
but
every
man
has
his
avocation
his
recreation
you
know
golf
roses
coins
first
editions
travel
walter
drury
being
a
confirmed
bachelor
missed
both
the
joys
and
the
demands
of
home
life
no
recluse
but
rather
a
companionable
man
he
cared
little
for
what
most
people
call
amusement
but
he
cared
tremendously
for
the
human
scene
in
which
he
lived
and
worked
he
would
be
happy
in
the
experiment
for
its
sheer
human
fascinations
that
it
held
a
deeper
interest
that
if
it
succeeded
it
would
reveal
an
untapped
reservoir
of
resources
available
for
the
church
and
the
kingdom
of
god
did
but
make
him
the
more
eager
to
be
at
it
in
hard
earnest
the
church
to
whose
work
he
had
joyfully
given
himself
from
his
youth
had
grown
to
be
a
mighty
and
a
highly
complex
machine
some
thought
it
was
more
machinery
than
life
more
organization
than
organism
but
walter
drury
knew
better
it
a
wonderful
machine
wheels
within
wheels
but
there
was
within
the
wheels
the
living
spirit
of
the
prophet
vision
partly
because
the
church
was
so
vast
and
its
work
of
such
infinite
variety
very
few
of
its
members
knew
what
it
did
or
how
or
why
it
was
all
over
the
land
and
in
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
people
joined
it
and
they
lived
their
lives
in
the
cheerful
and
congenial
circle
of
its
fellowship
but
the
planetary
sweep
of
its
program
and
its
enterprises
was
to
most
of
them
not
even
as
a
tale
that
is
told
they
were
content
to
be
busy
with
their
own
affairs
and
had
small
curiosity
to
know
what
meanings
and
mysteries
might
be
discovered
out
in
places
they
had
never
explored
even
though
just
the
corner
from
the
activities
of
the
familiar
home
congregation
walter
drury
at
the
end
of
one
reasonably
successful
pastorate
had
stood
bewildered
and
baffled
as
he
looked
back
over
his
five
years
of
effort
against
this
persistent
and
amiable
passivity
it
was
not
a
deliberate
sin
or
he
might
have
denounced
it
nor
a
temporary
numbness
or
he
might
have
waited
for
it
to
disappear
all
the
more
it
dismayed
him
at
the
beginning
of
his
ministry
he
had
set
this
goal
before
him
that
every
soul
under
his
care
might
see
as
he
saw
and
see
with
him
more
clearly
year
by
year
the
church
great
work
its
true
and
total
business
he
had
not
failed
as
the
annual
conference
reckons
failure
but
he
knew
he
had
been
less
than
successful
the
people
of
his
successive
appointments
were
receptive
people
as
church
folk
go
then
who
was
to
blame
that
sermons
and
books
and
advocates
and
pictures
and
high
officials
and
frequent
great
assemblies
always
accomplishing
something
always
left
behind
them
the
untouched
unmoved
majority
of
the
people
called
methodists
it
was
all
this
and
more
of
the
same
sort
which
at
last
took
shape
in
drury
thought
and
fixed
the
manner
and
matter
of
the
experiment
this
boy
he
had
found
with
a
name
that
might
be
either
prophecy
or
mockery
he
would
study
like
a
book
he
would
brood
over
his
life
mind
you
he
would
take
no
advantage
use
no
influence
unfairly
he
would
neither
dictate
nor
drive
he
would
not
trespass
even
so
far
as
to
the
outer
edges
of
the
boy
free
personality
for
the
most
part
he
would
stay
in
the
background
but
he
would
watch
the
boy
as
for
lesser
outcomes
darwin
watched
the
creatures
of
wood
and
field
without
revealing
all
his
purpose
he
would
set
before
this
boy
good
and
evil
the
lesser
good
and
the
greater
he
would
use
for
high
and
holy
ends
the
method
which
the
tempter
never
tires
of
using
for
confusion
he
would
show
this
boy
the
kingdoms
of
the
children
of
god
and
the
glories
of
them
and
would
promise
them
to
him
not
for
a
moment
shame
but
for
a
life
devotion
as
to
the
particular
form
in
which
the
result
of
the
experiment
might
appear
he
cared
little
he
had
a
certain
curiosity
on
the
subject
naturally
but
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
experiment
would
be
useless
if
he
laid
interfering
hands
on
its
inner
processes
that
would
be
like
trimming
a
whitethorn
tree
in
a
formal
garden
to
make
it
resemble
a
pyramid
he
was
not
making
a
thorn
pyramid
in
an
italian
garden
he
wanted
an
oak
to
grow
by
the
common
road
of
all
men
life
and
oaks
must
grow
or
not
at
all
four
years
of
the
ten
had
passed
that
part
of
the
history
of
john
wesley
which
is
told
in
the
following
pages
is
the
story
of
the
other
six
years
chapter
i
an
institute
panorama
if
anybody
expects
me
to
stay
away
from
institute
this
year
he
has
got
a
surprise
coming
that
all
the
meeting
was
just
breaking
up
after
a
speech
whose
closing
words
had
been
a
shade
less
tactful
than
the
occasion
called
for
but
the
last
two
sentences
of
that
speech
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
john
wesley
jr
the
epworth
league
of
first
church
delafield
was
giving
one
of
its
fairly
frequent
socials
the
program
had
gone
at
top
speed
for
more
than
an
hour
all
that
noise
could
do
by
that
peculiar
emanation
by
youth
termed
pep
had
been
drawn
upon
to
glorify
a
certain
forthcoming
event
with
whose
name
everybody
seemed
to
be
familiar
for
all
called
it
simply
the
institute
pennants
posters
and
photographs
supplied
a
sort
of
pictorial
noise
the
better
to
advertise
this
evidently
remarkable
event
which
one
might
gather
was
a
yearly
affair
held
during
the
summer
vacation
at
the
seat
of
cartwright
college
the
yells
and
songs
the
cheers
and
games
and
reminiscences
the
noisy
decorations
at
the
last
in
one
of
those
intense
moments
of
quiet
which
young
people
can
produce
as
by
magic
came
a
neat
little
speech
whose
purpose
was
highly
praiseworthy
but
to
john
wesley
it
ended
on
the
wrong
note
another
listener
took
mental
exception
to
it
though
his
anxiety
proved
to
be
groundless
it
was
a
recruiting
speech
directed
at
anybody
and
everybody
who
had
not
yet
decided
to
attend
the
institute
the
speaker
was
if
anything
a
trifle
more
cautious
than
canny
when
he
came
to
his
in
conclusion
and
his
zeal
touched
the
words
with
of
course
he
said
since
ten
or
at
most
twelve
is
our
quota
we
are
not
quite
free
to
encourage
the
attendance
of
everybody
particularly
of
our
younger
members
they
have
hardly
reached
the
age
where
the
institute
could
be
a
benefit
to
them
and
their
natural
inclination
to
make
the
week
a
period
of
good
times
and
mere
pleasure
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
interests
of
others
more
mature
and
serious
minded
now
the
pastor
of
the
church
the
rev
walter
drury
would
have
put
that
differently
he
said
to
himself
if
it
produced
any
bad
effects
it
would
need
to
be
corrected
certainly
just
then
amid
the
inevitable
applause
and
the
dismissal
of
the
brief
formal
assembly
for
the
social
something
snapped
inside
of
john
wesley
and
it
was
the
feeling
of
it
which
prompted
him
to
say
if
anybody
expects
me
to
stay
away
from
institute
this
year
he
has
got
a
surprise
coming
that
all
you
see
john
wesley
had
just
been
graduated
from
high
school
and
his
family
expected
him
to
go
to
college
in
the
fall
though
he
faced
that
expectation
without
much
enthusiasm
he
felt
his
new
freedom
he
addressed
his
rebellious
remark
to
the
league
president
marcia
dayne
a
sensible
girl
whom
he
had
known
as
long
as
he
had
known
anybody
in
the
church
last
year
everybody
said
i
was
too
young
they
all
talked
the
way
he
did
just
now
but
they
ca
say
i
am
too
young
now
and
with
that
easy
skill
which
is
one
of
the
secrets
of
youth
he
managed
to
contemplate
himself
serenely
conscious
that
he
was
personable
and
right
the
girl
turned
to
him
with
a
gesture
of
surprise
but
i
thought
your
father
had
agreed
to
let
you
take
that
trip
to
chicago
you
have
been
saving
up
for
will
he
let
you
go
to
the
institute
too
chicago
can
wait
said
john
wesley
grandly
dad
did
say
i
could
go
to
chicago
to
see
my
cousins
or
i
could
go
anywhere
else
that
i
wanted
well
i
am
going
to
the
institute
it
my
money
and
besides
i
am
tired
of
being
told
i
am
too
young
a
fellow
got
to
grow
up
some
time
that
all
right
said
marcia
but
what
your
special
interest
in
the
institute
do
you
truly
want
to
go
how
do
you
know
what
an
institute
is
like
her
voice
carried
further
than
marcia
thought
and
a
man
who
seemed
a
little
too
mature
to
be
one
of
the
young
people
turned
toward
her
he
was
smiling
and
any
time
these
four
years
the
town
would
have
told
you
there
was
a
friendlier
smile
inside
the
city
limits
he
was
in
business
dress
and
suggested
anything
but
the
parson
in
his
bearing
but
through
and
through
he
looked
the
good
minister
that
he
was
marcia
moved
toward
him
with
an
unspoken
appeal
she
wanted
help
he
was
waiting
for
that
signal
for
he
depended
a
good
deal
on
marcia
and
he
was
still
worried
about
that
unlucky
speech
well
marcia
are
you
telling
what
the
institute
really
is
he
asked
no
drury
i
not
i
too
much
surprised
at
finding
that
about
decided
to
go
you
just
in
time
to
tell
him
for
me
i
want
him
to
get
it
right
and
straight
well
the
pastor
responded
i
glad
of
that
if
he
really
going
he
find
out
that
definitions
are
not
descriptions
now
our
saint
sheridan
used
to
say
that
an
institute
was
a
combination
of
college
circus
and
camp
meeting
i
would
venture
a
different
putting
of
it
an
institute
is
a
bit
of
young
democracy
in
action
its
people
play
together
for
play
sake
and
for
finding
their
honest
human
level
they
study
together
to
become
decently
intelligent
about
some
of
the
real
business
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
how
the
church
proposes
to
transact
that
business
they
wait
for
new
vision
together
the
institute
being
a
good
time
and
a
good
place
for
seeing
life
clear
and
seeing
it
whole
yes
said
marcia
that
exactly
it
only
i
never
could
have
found
quite
the
right
words
do
you
think
will
find
it
too
poky
and
preachy
tell
him
to
try
it
and
see
as
you
did
last
year
said
pastor
drury
i
risk
that
said
john
wesley
in
his
newly
resolute
mood
he
knew
when
to
stop
this
preacher
particularly
concerned
as
he
was
about
john
wesley
he
saw
that
this
was
one
of
the
many
times
when
that
young
man
would
need
to
work
things
out
for
himself
marcia
would
give
what
help
might
be
called
for
at
the
moment
the
boy
was
turning
toward
the
institute
so
far
so
good
was
nearly
four
years
from
the
beginning
of
his
interest
in
this
young
fellow
with
the
methodist
name
he
was
a
special
friend
of
the
family
though
no
more
so
than
of
every
family
in
the
town
which
gave
him
the
slightest
encouragement
to
a
degree
which
no
one
suspected
he
shared
this
family
secret
hopes
for
its
son
and
heir
and
he
cherished
hopes
which
even
the
farwells
could
not
suspect
unless
he
was
much
mistaken
he
had
found
the
subject
for
his
experiment
that
mention
of
the
farwells
needs
to
be
explained
of
course
john
wesley
was
only
part
of
the
boy
name
in
full
he
was
john
wesley
farwell
son
of
john
wesley
farwell
of
the
farwell
hardware
as
a
little
fellow
he
had
no
chance
to
escape
junior
since
he
was
named
for
his
father
there
were
many
jacks
and
johns
and
johnnies
about
his
mother
good
methodist
that
she
was
secretly
enjoyed
calling
him
john
wesley
and
before
long
the
neighbors
and
the
neighborhood
children
followed
her
example
a
little
later
he
might
have
been
teased
out
of
it
but
at
the
impossible
age
when
boys
discover
that
queer
names
and
red
hair
and
make
convenient
excuses
for
mutual
torture
it
happened
that
he
had
attained
to
the
leadership
of
his
gang
for
some
reason
he
took
pride
in
his
two
methodist
names
and
made
short
work
of
those
who
ventured
to
take
liberties
with
them
in
all
other
respects
he
played
without
reserve
boyhood
immemorial
game
of
give
and
take
but
as
to
his
name
or
any
part
thereof
he
would
tolerate
no
foolishness
and
no
back
talk
when
he
reached
the
high
school
period
however
most
of
his
intimates
rarely
called
him
by
his
full
name
having
like
all
high
school
people
no
time
for
long
names
though
possessed
of
infinite
leisure
for
long
dreams
straightway
they
shortened
his
name
to
which
to
this
day
is
all
that
his
friends
find
necessary
very
well
then
this
is
at
eighteen
a
young
fellow
worth
knowing
take
a
look
at
him
impulsive
generous
not
what
you
would
call
handsome
but
possessed
of
a
genial
eye
and
a
ready
tongue
a
stubby
nose
and
a
few
scattered
freckles
a
fair
student
he
is
yet
far
from
bookishness
and
he
makes
friends
easily
of
late
he
has
been
paying
furtive
but
detailed
attention
to
his
hair
and
his
neckties
and
the
hang
of
his
clothes
though
still
in
small
danger
of
being
mistaken
for
a
tailor
model
with
such
a
name
you
will
understand
that
he
a
methodist
by
first
intention
born
so
he
is
a
pretty
sturdy
young
christian
showing
it
in
a
boy
modest
but
direct
fashion
which
even
his
teammates
of
the
football
squad
found
it
no
trouble
to
tolerate
because
they
knew
him
for
a
human
healthy
boy
and
not
a
morbid
religious
prig
pastor
drury
you
may
be
sure
had
taken
note
of
all
that
for
he
and
had
been
fast
friends
since
the
day
he
had
received
the
boy
into
the
church
the
morning
after
the
institute
social
announced
at
breakfast
his
sudden
change
of
plan
if
you
do
mind
dad
i
about
decided
to
go
to
the
institute
instead
of
chicago
there
is
a
bunch
of
us
going
and
drury
will
be
there
uncle
henry
folks
might
not
want
to
be
bothered
with
me
now
and
anyway
i
do
know
them
very
well
but
i
can
go
to
the
institute
with
the
church
crowd
and
there
will
be
tennis
and
swimming
and
plenty
of
other
fun
besides
the
big
program
which
was
quite
a
speech
for
john
wesley
did
know
much
about
the
institute
but
he
had
an
endless
regard
for
his
pastor
and
the
mother
was
characteristically
willing
to
postpone
her
boy
introduction
to
the
unknown
and
in
her
thought
therefore
the
menacing
city
so
after
the
brief
but
unhurried
devotions
at
the
breakfast
table
which
had
come
to
serve
in
place
of
the
family
prayers
parental
approval
was
forthcoming
and
thus
it
befell
that
selected
for
himself
a
future
whose
every
experience
was
to
be
affected
by
so
slight
a
matter
as
his
impulsive
choice
of
a
week
holiday
that
choice
expressed
to
him
the
new
freedom
of
his
years
for
he
had
not
even
been
conscious
of
the
quiet
influence
which
had
made
it
easier
than
he
knew
to
decide
as
he
had
done
it
was
a
mixed
and
lively
company
that
found
itself
crowded
around
the
registrar
table
at
the
institute
one
monday
evening
in
july
with
and
his
own
particular
chum
martin
luther
shenk
better
known
as
marty
right
in
the
middle
of
it
wondered
where
so
many
epworthians
could
have
come
from
did
they
really
hanker
after
the
institute
or
had
they
come
for
reasons
as
trivial
as
his
own
he
put
the
question
to
martin
luther
shenk
marty
do
you
reckon
these
are
all
here
for
real
epworth
league
work
or
does
the
institute
want
anybody
and
everybody
marty
had
been
scouting
a
little
and
he
answered
no
to
both
questions
i
should
say
some
have
come
just
to
be
coming
and
others
seem
to
be
here
for
business
but
i
saw
joe
carbrook
just
now
and
if
he
is
an
epworth
leaguer
i
am
the
prince
of
puget
sound
you
know
how
he
stands
at
home
wonder
what
he
came
for
just
then
joe
carbrook
himself
came
up
he
was
from
delafield
too
member
of
the
same
league
chapter
as
the
two
chums
but
he
had
rarely
condescended
to
league
affairs
having
had
two
rather
variegated
years
at
college
he
felt
he
must
show
his
sophistication
by
holding
himself
above
some
of
those
simple
old
observances
you
are
here
for
solemn
and
serious
work
you
two
he
remarked
mockingly
as
he
saw
the
boys
i
just
met
marcia
dayne
and
she
told
me
you
were
registering
well
i
here
too
drove
up
in
my
car
but
you
do
catch
me
tying
myself
down
to
all
that
study
stuff
i
looking
for
fun
not
work
nothing
new
for
you
in
that
joe
said
marty
but
i
should
think
you
might
try
the
study
stuff
if
only
for
a
change
after
you
have
spent
good
money
on
gas
and
tires
and
you
have
to
pay
for
your
meals
you
know
well
i
studied
hard
enough
last
month
in
college
cramming
for
the
final
exams
so
i
could
get
within
gunshot
of
enough
sophomore
credits
and
i
through
with
study
for
a
while
if
i
find
a
few
live
ones
in
this
crowd
i
guess
we
can
enjoy
ourselves
without
interfering
with
any
of
you
grinds
if
you
must
study
and
joe
carbrook
went
off
in
search
of
his
live
ones
and
marty
were
in
no
hurry
to
register
the
crowd
milling
around
in
the
office
was
interesting
and
was
still
wondering
how
many
of
them
himself
included
would
get
enough
institute
long
before
the
week
was
over
besides
it
was
yet
an
hour
before
supper
think
of
it
marty
all
these
people
come
from
epworth
leagues
just
like
ours
from
springfield
and
wolf
prairie
and
madison
and
all
over
this
part
of
the
state
what
for
i
like
to
know
will
you
look
at
those
pennants
wish
we
had
brought
one
or
two
of
ours
we
could
add
to
the
display
anyway
i
have
two
in
my
suitcase
said
marty
we
have
them
out
this
evening
at
the
introduction
meeting
and
maybe
you
find
out
for
by
that
time
the
introduction
meeting
in
the
chapel
after
supper
was
for
the
most
part
informal
yells
and
songs
and
the
waving
of
pennants
punctuated
the
proceedings
as
is
quite
the
proper
thing
in
an
epworth
league
gathering
some
people
who
see
only
what
is
on
the
surface
can
not
wholly
understand
the
exuberance
of
an
epworth
league
crowd
but
it
has
roots
in
something
very
real
the
dean
of
the
institute
managed
amid
the
roystering
and
the
intervals
of
attention
to
set
things
up
for
the
week
a
few
regulations
would
need
to
be
laid
down
and
these
would
be
fixed
not
by
the
faculty
or
by
the
dean
but
by
the
student
council
would
each
district
group
please
get
together
at
once
and
select
some
one
to
represent
the
group
on
this
council
this
request
being
obeyed
amid
considerable
confusion
with
marcia
dayne
appointed
from
the
fort
adams
district
and
the
council
excused
to
draft
the
basic
laws
for
the
week
the
faculty
was
introduced
one
by
one
each
teacher
was
given
the
opportunity
to
describe
his
or
her
course
so
that
out
of
the
eight
or
nine
courses
offered
every
delegate
might
select
two
besides
the
two
which
were
required
of
all
students
and
so
qualify
for
an
institute
diploma
found
himself
enjoying
all
this
hugely
it
appealed
to
his
growing
sense
of
freedom
from
schoolboy
restraint
if
he
did
go
to
any
of
the
classes
it
appeared
that
he
could
pick
the
ones
he
liked
up
to
now
he
had
entertained
no
thought
of
any
serious
work
but
the
faculty
talks
about
these
courses
made
him
think
there
might
be
worse
ways
of
spending
the
week
than
qualifying
for
an
institute
diploma
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
be
so
easy
and
so
friendly
of
course
he
could
see
that
the
study
would
not
be
much
even
if
he
signed
up
for
it
being
just
for
a
week
but
it
might
not
be
bad
fun
morning
watch
was
an
experience
to
he
was
surprised
to
find
himself
staying
awake
in
a
religious
meeting
and
was
even
more
surprised
to
be
enjoying
it
something
about
this
big
crowd
of
young
people
stirred
all
his
pulses
and
the
religion
they
heard
about
and
talked
about
seemed
to
something
very
real
and
desirable
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
christian
but
he
wondered
if
his
christian
life
might
not
become
more
confident
and
productive
in
this
atmosphere
one
almost
felt
that
anything
was
possible
meal
times
turned
out
to
be
times
of
orderly
disorder
and
his
friends
were
at
a
table
with
other
groups
from
the
fort
adams
district
and
he
quickly
mastered
the
raucous
roar
which
served
the
district
for
a
yell
before
the
end
of
the
second
day
his
alert
good
nature
made
him
cheer
leader
and
thereafter
he
rarely
had
time
to
eat
all
that
was
set
before
him
though
possessed
of
a
boy
healthy
appetite
it
was
simply
that
the
other
possibilities
of
the
hour
seemed
more
alluring
than
mere
food
from
the
first
day
of
the
class
work
found
himself
keen
for
all
that
was
going
on
there
was
variety
enough
so
that
he
felt
no
weariness
and
the
range
of
new
interests
opened
up
each
day
kept
him
at
constant
and
pleasurable
attention
without
knowing
just
how
he
was
catching
the
institute
spirit
he
walked
away
from
the
dining
hall
one
noon
with
his
and
he
talked
he
had
to
talk
to
somebody
and
walter
drury
contrived
to
know
of
his
need
why
drury
he
said
eagerly
i
just
finding
out
how
little
i
know
about
the
church
and
real
christian
work
i
thought
i
was
something
of
an
average
methodist
boy
but
if
the
people
at
home
are
no
better
than
i
am
i
can
see
how
being
a
preacher
to
such
a
bunch
is
a
job
correct
said
the
minister
i
find
that
out
many
a
time
to
my
humbling
but
honestly
now
are
you
learning
things
you
never
knew
before
i
am
answered
and
then
again
i
not
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
always
known
a
lot
of
what
we
are
getting
in
these
classes
though
there
is
plenty
of
new
stuff
too
but
until
now
i
did
get
much
out
of
what
i
knew
i
always
liked
to
hear
you
but
you
different
as
for
most
of
the
things
i
heard
i
just
thought
of
it
as
religious
talk
church
stuff
you
know
it
did
seem
to
matter
but
here
it
is
beginning
to
matter
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
i
can
see
that
it
matters
to
me
how
for
instance
well
take
the
class
in
home
missions
americanization
they
call
it
maybe
you
noticed
that
the
first
thing
the
teacher
did
was
to
divide
the
class
right
down
the
middle
and
tell
those
on
the
left
hand
yes
one
of
the
goats
that
for
the
rest
of
the
week
they
were
to
consider
themselves
aliens
the
others
were
to
play
americans
and
so
the
study
started
but
believe
me
we
aliens
have
already
begun
to
make
it
interesting
for
those
natives
some
of
want
to
come
over
on
our
side
already
but
they
ca
a
few
of
us
have
found
some
immigration
dope
in
the
college
library
and
it
is
pretty
strong
we
show
up
those
pilgrim
fathers
before
the
week
is
out
they
think
they
have
done
everything
an
alien
could
ask
when
they
let
him
into
the
country
and
then
they
work
him
twelve
hours
a
day
seven
days
a
week
or
else
let
him
hunt
the
country
over
for
any
sort
of
a
job
they
rob
him
by
making
him
pay
higher
prices
than
other
people
for
all
he
has
to
buy
they
force
him
to
live
in
places
not
fit
for
rats
and
on
top
of
everything
else
they
call
him
names
so
that
their
kids
stick
up
their
noses
at
his
children
in
the
school
grounds
after
all
that
they
expect
he
become
a
good
citizen
just
by
hearing
banner
at
the
movies
and
watching
the
flag
go
by
when
there
a
parade
say
drury
it
makes
me
sick
and
if
i
feel
that
way
just
to
be
pretending
i
a
for
a
week
how
do
you
suppose
the
real
aliens
feel
excuse
me
for
talking
like
this
but
honestly
something
like
that
is
going
on
in
all
these
classes
i
wish
we
could
take
up
such
things
in
the
league
at
home
and
he
forced
an
embarrassed
little
laugh
pastor
drury
laughed
too
and
said
of
course
they
could
as
he
linked
arms
with
and
they
passed
on
down
the
road
the
preacher
talked
but
little
contriving
merely
to
drop
a
question
now
and
then
and
talked
on
to
be
so
gabby
as
he
put
it
and
yet
moved
by
an
impulse
as
pleasant
as
it
was
novel
and
foreign
missions
drury
you
wo
be
offended
i
hope
but
somehow
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
i
have
always
connected
foreign
missions
with
collections
and
icy
mountains
and
little
naked
hottentots
and
something
i
do
know
just
what
about
the
river
ganges
but
here
why
that
china
class
just
makes
me
want
to
see
china
for
myself
and
find
out
how
much
of
the
advantages
of
american
life
over
chinese
has
come
on
account
of
religion
well
why
not
maybe
you
will
go
to
china
some
day
and
have
a
hand
in
it
all
suggested
the
pastor
to
try
him
out
the
boy
shook
his
head
no
i
do
think
so
i
am
certainly
getting
a
new
line
on
foreign
missions
but
i
do
think
there
missionary
stuff
in
me
i
have
to
go
at
the
proposition
some
other
way
then
pastor
drury
set
him
going
on
another
subject
what
do
you
think
of
the
young
folks
who
are
here
he
asked
well
at
first
i
thought
they
were
all
away
ahead
of
our
bunch
at
home
and
some
of
them
are
but
you
soon
find
out
that
the
majority
is
pretty
much
of
the
same
sort
as
ours
i
think
i
spotted
a
few
slackers
but
mighty
few
most
of
the
crowd
seems
to
be
all
right
and
i
already
made
some
real
friends
but
do
you
know
which
one
of
them
all
is
the
most
interesting
fellow
i
met
the
pastor
thought
he
did
but
he
merely
asked
who
why
that
greek
boy
phil
khamis
he
is
from
salonika
you
know
he
knows
the
old
country
like
a
book
and
he
going
back
some
day
maybe
to
be
some
kind
of
missionary
to
his
people
in
the
very
places
where
the
apostle
paul
preached
honest
i
never
knew
until
he
told
me
that
his
salonika
is
the
town
of
those
christians
to
whom
paul
wrote
two
of
his
letters
those
to
the
thessalonians
you
know
well
you
ought
to
hear
phil
talk
he
came
over
here
seven
years
ago
and
learned
the
english
language
from
the
preacher
at
westvale
yes
i
have
heard
about
him
said
drury
they
say
he
lived
in
the
parsonage
and
paid
the
preacher
for
his
english
lessons
by
giving
him
a
new
understanding
of
the
greek
new
testament
not
many
of
us
have
found
out
yet
how
to
get
such
pay
for
being
decent
to
our
friends
from
the
other
side
well
he
is
a
thoroughbred
anyway
and
do
you
notice
how
he
is
right
up
in
front
when
there
is
anything
doing
the
only
way
you
can
tell
he
is
american
born
is
that
he
is
so
anxious
to
help
out
on
all
the
unpleasant
work
when
i
look
at
phil
it
makes
me
boil
to
think
of
fellows
like
him
being
called
by
this
time
the
two
had
swung
back
into
the
campus
and
found
himself
drafted
to
hold
down
second
base
in
the
ball
game
but
that
is
a
story
for
others
to
tell
on
the
steps
of
the
library
marcia
dayne
and
some
other
girls
were
holding
an
informal
reception
joe
carbrook
with
one
or
two
of
his
friends
was
finding
it
agreeable
to
assume
a
superior
air
concerning
the
institute
the
impression
the
boys
gave
was
that
their
coming
to
the
institute
at
all
had
been
a
great
concession
but
that
they
were
under
no
illusions
about
the
place
all
this
is
all
right
joe
was
saying
for
those
who
need
it
but
what
the
good
of
it
all
to
us
for
instance
what
do
you
get
out
of
it
marcia
what
do
you
think
i
want
to
get
out
of
it
if
you
cared
for
the
young
people
work
at
home
i
should
think
you
could
see
how
this
as
you
call
it
would
help
you
to
do
better
work
and
more
of
it
at
delafield
as
you
ought
to
know
pretty
well
marcia
joe
replied
back
home
they
think
i
do
care
much
for
the
young
people
work
it
is
a
little
too
prim
and
for
me
if
you
excuse
me
for
saying
so
no
fun
in
it
at
all
though
i
admit
some
of
the
classes
here
have
more
life
in
them
than
i
looked
for
one
of
the
other
girls
who
knew
him
well
enough
to
speak
with
large
frankness
came
to
the
defense
of
them
all
saying
well
joe
i
see
that
you
get
very
far
with
what
you
call
fun
it
mostly
at
the
expense
of
other
people
including
your
father
who
pays
the
bills
besides
since
you
came
home
from
college
this
spring
you
seem
to
have
run
out
of
nearly
all
the
bright
ideas
you
started
with
i
wonder
if
it
ever
strikes
you
that
being
a
sport
as
you
call
it
is
mostly
being
a
nuisance
to
everybody
some
of
us
long
ago
got
over
thinking
you
clever
and
original
you
must
be
getting
over
it
yourself
by
now
surely
many
thanks
dear
lady
for
them
kind
words
joe
responded
as
he
bowed
low
in
mock
acknowledgment
you
make
yourself
quite
plain
miss
alma
wetherell
he
flung
back
the
insult
jauntily
as
he
and
his
companions
moved
on
but
at
least
one
of
the
group
suspected
that
the
words
had
struck
home
you
who
know
the
general
secretary
could
easily
forgive
his
delight
in
the
class
of
which
the
program
said
the
subject
was
methods
this
is
the
only
hour
in
an
institute
which
the
epworth
league
takes
for
its
own
work
rightly
enough
it
is
a
crowded
hour
with
the
whole
institute
present
and
usually
it
is
an
hour
of
unflagging
interest
and
marty
were
enjoying
their
first
institute
too
much
to
be
late
at
any
classes
they
were
merely
a
little
earlier
at
this
class
to
miss
any
of
it
would
be
a
distinct
loss
now
what
the
general
secretary
talked
about
was
no
more
than
the
everyday
work
of
the
league
how
it
meant
the
young
people
of
the
church
and
their
work
for
and
with
young
people
for
the
sake
of
the
future
but
he
had
a
way
with
him
he
said
the
league
was
a
great
scheme
of
self
with
the
ish
left
off
in
the
league
one
practiced
and
enjoyed
the
twin
luxuries
of
and
and
came
sooner
or
later
to
that
strange
new
knowledge
which
is
he
explained
how
epworthians
as
such
could
live
on
hours
a
day
the
plan
being
an
ingenious
and
yet
simple
financial
arrangement
for
keeping
the
league
work
moving
both
where
you
are
and
where
you
are
even
around
the
world
he
had
innumerable
stories
of
the
devotional
meeting
idea
the
idea
the
stewardship
idea
the
institute
idea
the
life
service
idea
the
recreation
idea
the
idea
and
every
other
league
idea
so
far
invented
but
all
this
is
merely
a
hint
of
what
the
general
secretary
meant
to
the
institute
and
particularly
to
the
delegates
from
delafield
even
joe
carbrook
had
been
impressed
he
heard
the
general
secretary
the
morning
after
that
little
exchange
of
compliments
on
the
library
steps
and
for
an
hour
thereafter
let
himself
enjoy
the
rare
luxury
of
thinking
the
results
were
somewhat
disconcerting
it
funny
said
marty
as
the
four
of
them
the
other
three
being
joe
marcia
and
sat
under
a
tree
in
the
afternoon
but
i
believe
that
man
could
make
even
trigonometry
interesting
i
thought
i
heard
all
that
could
be
said
about
the
devotional
meeting
but
did
you
get
that
scheme
for
leaders
he
sprung
this
morning
watch
me
when
we
get
back
home
that
all
you
need
suppose
you
are
the
only
one
who
got
it
said
marcia
everybody
was
trying
to
watch
the
general
secretary
and
to
take
notes
at
the
same
time
and
i
do
believe
you
are
any
quicker
at
that
than
the
rest
of
us
of
course
all
of
us
will
use
as
many
of
his
ideas
as
we
can
remember
when
we
get
home
again
joe
carbrook
with
a
new
seriousness
which
sat
awkwardly
on
him
confessed
that
he
could
not
understand
just
what
was
happening
it
was
evident
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
marcia
had
noticed
it
every
time
she
had
seen
him
since
that
encounter
with
alma
wetherell
i
guess
you
folks
know
i
am
not
easily
caught
but
i
ready
to
admit
that
man
has
hold
of
something
yes
and
i
half
convinced
that
this
institute
has
hold
of
something
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
is
if
i
could
really
believe
that
all
i
hear
and
see
at
this
place
is
part
of
being
young
and
part
of
being
a
christian
i
might
be
thinking
before
long
about
getting
into
the
game
myself
the
trouble
is
you
three
and
the
other
leaguers
i
watched
at
home
are
just
you
three
and
the
others
and
that
all
i
know
and
you
know
what
you
can
do
you
take
all
these
ideas
of
league
work
and
use
them
maybe
but
what
i
ca
see
is
how
you
will
pick
up
the
big
idea
of
this
place
and
get
back
home
without
losing
it
we
ca
said
marcia
not
without
all
sorts
of
help
visible
and
invisible
you
for
instance
if
you
would
really
get
into
the
game
as
you
say
nobody
could
guess
how
much
it
would
mean
to
our
league
and
it
might
mean
more
to
you
marcia
right
about
that
said
the
big
idea
of
this
place
that
you
speak
of
is
a
lot
too
big
for
us
to
take
home
alone
maybe
think
i
preaching
but
i
do
care
if
i
say
that
for
god
to
handle
alone
it
is
not
big
enough
he
makes
the
stars
and
gives
us
his
son
without
any
help
from
us
nobody
else
can
do
that
but
he
wo
make
our
league
at
home
a
success
without
us
and
all
of
us
together
ca
do
it
without
him
i
not
saying
i
know
how
to
do
it
even
then
but
the
way
it
looks
to
me
why
joe
he
said
with
sudden
intensity
as
he
faced
joe
carbrook
if
you
ever
get
hold
of
the
big
idea
and
the
big
idea
gets
hold
of
you
something
is
sure
to
happen
something
bigger
than
any
of
us
can
figure
out
now
i
know
you
have
it
in
you
all
four
showed
a
surprised
over
unexpected
venture
into
these
rather
deeper
conversational
waters
than
usual
and
there
was
more
surprise
when
joe
carbrook
began
to
talk
about
himself
he
laughed
to
hide
a
touch
of
embarrassment
but
with
little
mirth
and
then
he
said
well
that
not
all
foolishness
though
i
see
why
you
should
pick
on
me
why
not
marty
of
course
i
came
here
for
fun
and
i
have
had
some
though
not
just
the
sort
i
expected
and
had
several
jolts
too
i
might
as
well
admit
that
if
i
could
just
only
see
how
you
hitch
all
of
this
league
and
church
business
to
real
life
i
would
be
for
it
with
all
i
got
the
trouble
is
while
i
never
been
especially
proud
of
my
own
record
neither
have
i
seen
much
excuse
yet
for
what
you
members
have
been
busy
with
i
have
been
playing
my
way
and
you
have
been
playing
yours
but
it
all
seems
mostly
play
to
me
all
the
same
i
guess
i
am
getting
tired
of
my
kind
if
joe
could
ever
have
spoken
wistfully
you
might
have
suspected
him
of
it
just
then
clearly
thought
marcia
dayne
in
the
silence
that
followed
something
big
was
already
happening
but
how
to
help
it
on
she
could
not
tell
so
with
a
desperate
effort
to
do
the
right
thing
she
contrived
to
turn
the
subject
it
seemed
to
her
it
had
become
too
difficult
to
go
further
just
now
without
peril
to
joe
strange
new
interest
as
well
as
to
a
very
new
and
tremulous
little
hope
that
had
begun
to
sing
in
her
own
heart
the
shift
of
the
talk
was
a
true
institute
change
and
would
have
been
most
disconcerting
to
anyone
unfamiliar
with
the
ways
of
young
christians
but
marcia
was
sure
that
what
had
been
said
would
not
be
forgotten
and
she
knew
there
would
be
another
time
it
was
this
that
made
her
say
i
wish
you
boys
would
suggest
what
sort
of
stunt
our
district
should
give
on
stunt
night
you
know
the
time
is
getting
short
that
a
fact
exclaimed
marty
sitting
up
stunt
night
is
and
our
delegation
has
to
fix
up
the
stunt
for
the
fort
adams
district
let
get
to
work
on
something
we
been
mooning
long
enough
for
though
marty
never
thought
as
quickly
as
marcia
he
too
felt
some
instinct
of
fear
lest
by
an
unfortunate
word
they
should
break
the
spell
of
joe
carbrook
interest
in
the
big
idea
and
promptly
the
four
were
deep
in
a
study
of
stunts
to
the
uninitiated
stunt
night
at
the
institute
is
without
rime
or
reason
but
not
to
those
in
charge
who
are
looking
ahead
to
sunday
they
know
that
the
converging
and
cumulative
psychic
forces
which
the
institute
invariably
produces
must
be
tempered
along
about
midway
of
the
week
by
some
sharp
contrast
in
the
communal
life
otherwise
the
group
like
athletes
will
grow
emotionally
stale
before
the
week
is
done
and
at
the
end
of
that
is
and
flatness
hence
stunt
night
in
the
early
institute
years
it
was
easy
as
in
some
places
it
still
is
for
stunt
night
to
be
no
more
than
clowning
witless
and
cheap
but
there
is
a
distinct
tendency
to
exercise
the
imagination
in
producing
more
efforts
cartwright
happily
is
one
of
the
institutes
and
stunt
night
crowded
with
most
excellent
fooling
produced
two
or
three
creditable
and
performances
one
of
them
deserves
remembering
for
its
own
sake
besides
it
is
a
part
of
this
story
the
home
missions
class
furnished
the
inspiration
for
it
and
called
it
scum
o
the
earth
an
impromptu
immigration
pageant
a
boy
who
had
memorized
schauffler
poem
stood
off
stage
and
recited
it
while
group
after
group
of
immigrants
in
the
motley
of
the
steerage
passed
slowly
through
the
improvised
ellis
island
sifting
process
it
was
all
of
course
all
but
one
tense
moment
then
phil
khamis
stepped
on
the
platform
incarnating
in
his
own
proper
person
the
apostrophised
greek
boy
stay
are
we
doing
you
wrong
young
fellow
from
socrates
land
you
like
a
hermes
so
lissome
and
strong
fresh
from
the
master
praxiteles
hand
so
you
of
spartan
birth
descended
perhaps
from
one
of
the
band
deathless
in
story
and
song
who
combed
their
long
hair
at
thermopylae
pass
ah
i
forget
the
straits
alas
more
tragic
than
theirs
more
that
have
doomed
you
to
march
in
our
where
you
nothing
but
o
the
earth
the
audience
was
caught
unaware
it
had
been
vastly
interested
in
the
spectacle
as
a
spectacle
the
more
because
the
unusual
americanization
class
which
produced
it
had
attracted
general
attention
but
phil
khamis
everybody
friend
standing
there
an
immigrant
of
the
immigrants
smiling
his
wistful
friendly
smile
was
a
picture
as
dramatic
as
it
was
unexpected
first
there
were
ejaculations
of
astonishment
and
surprise
then
came
the
moment
of
understanding
and
a
stillness
fell
on
all
then
what
a
shout
led
off
the
unashamed
tears
falling
from
his
brimming
eyes
on
saturday
morning
was
sitting
beside
phil
khamis
at
morning
watch
the
leader
had
asked
for
answers
to
the
question
why
did
i
come
to
the
institute
getting
several
responses
of
the
conventional
sort
suddenly
phil
nudged
and
whispered
shall
i
tell
why
i
came
and
with
the
memory
of
stunt
night
thrill
not
yet
dulled
said
promptly
sure
go
ahead
when
phil
got
up
an
attentive
silence
fell
upon
them
all
the
greek
boy
had
made
many
friends
as
much
by
his
engaging
frankness
and
anxiety
to
learn
as
by
his
perpetual
eagerness
to
have
a
hand
in
every
bit
of
hard
work
that
turned
up
since
the
stunt
night
incident
he
was
favorite
friends
he
said
in
his
rather
careful
precise
way
i
am
here
for
a
different
reason
than
any
when
i
was
in
america
but
a
little
time
a
methodist
preacher
made
himself
my
friend
i
could
not
speak
english
only
a
few
words
he
took
me
to
his
home
he
taught
me
to
talk
the
american
way
he
find
me
other
friends
though
i
could
do
nothing
at
all
for
them
to
pay
them
back
now
i
am
christian
real
not
only
baptized
the
young
people
of
the
church
take
me
in
to
whatever
they
do
they
call
me
and
never
care
that
i
am
a
foreigner
so
when
i
heard
about
this
institute
i
say
to
myself
is
something
strange
to
me
but
i
hear
that
many
people
like
those
in
my
church
will
be
there
i
can
not
quite
believe
that
but
it
sounded
good
and
i
wanted
to
come
and
see
and
now
i
know
that
many
people
are
young
people
like
those
i
first
knew
they
treat
me
just
the
same
it
makes
me
love
america
much
more
and
if
i
could
tell
my
people
in
the
old
country
that
all
this
good
has
come
to
me
from
the
church
they
could
not
believe
it
still
it
is
true
everything
i
have
has
come
to
me
by
goodness
of
christian
people
there
were
some
amens
and
more
than
one
hitherto
unsuspected
cold
required
considerable
attention
all
the
way
to
breakfast
phil
held
embarrassed
court
while
his
hand
was
shaken
and
his
shoulder
was
thumped
and
he
was
told
solo
and
chorus
by
all
who
could
get
near
him
that
he
all
right
who
all
right
phil
khamis
but
was
walking
slowly
toward
the
dining
hall
alone
as
he
had
listened
to
phil
at
first
he
thought
good
old
scout
he
putting
it
over
but
by
the
time
the
greek
simple
words
were
ended
was
looking
himself
straight
in
the
eye
young
fellow
he
was
saying
you
have
come
mighty
near
feeling
glad
that
you
have
had
so
many
more
advantages
than
this
stranger
and
yet
ca
you
see
that
what
he
says
about
himself
is
almost
as
true
about
you
all
you
have
this
institute
your
religion
your
church
your
friends
the
kind
of
a
home
you
have
and
are
so
proud
of
everything
has
come
to
you
by
what
phil
calls
the
goodness
of
christian
people
and
then
it
was
breakfast
time
with
an
imperative
call
on
from
the
fort
adams
table
for
that
new
yell
we
fixed
up
last
night
and
the
minutes
in
which
he
had
talked
with
himself
were
for
the
time
forgotten
but
the
memory
of
them
came
back
in
the
days
after
the
institute
was
itself
a
memory
the
saturday
night
camp
fire
at
this
institute
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
was
not
the
boys
went
down
to
the
lake
shore
and
sat
around
a
big
fire
on
the
sand
the
girls
had
their
fire
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
at
the
other
edge
of
the
campus
nor
does
this
institute
care
for
too
much
praise
of
itself
its
traditional
spirit
is
to
work
more
for
outcomes
than
for
the
devices
which
produce
complacency
it
stages
only
a
few
opportunities
of
telling
why
i
like
this
institute
so
at
the
camp
fires
a
man
talked
to
the
boys
and
a
woman
to
the
girls
not
about
the
institute
but
about
life
these
speakers
knew
the
strange
effect
an
institute
week
has
on
impressionable
and
romantic
youth
they
knew
that
by
this
time
scores
of
the
students
were
either
saying
to
themselves
i
got
to
do
something
big
before
this
thing
over
or
were
vainly
trying
to
put
the
conviction
away
the
woman
who
talked
to
the
girls
happened
to
be
a
preacher
wife
this
gave
her
a
certain
advantage
when
she
told
the
listening
girls
that
the
greatest
of
all
occupations
for
them
was
not
some
special
vocation
but
what
ida
tarbell
has
called
the
business
of
being
a
woman
it
was
good
preparation
for
the
next
day
program
with
its
specific
and
glamorous
appeal
for
it
put
first
the
great
claim
so
that
special
vocations
could
be
seen
in
clear
air
and
could
be
fairly
measured
pastor
drury
who
talked
to
the
boys
was
talking
to
them
all
as
very
well
knew
but
every
word
seemed
for
him
as
indeed
it
was
in
a
sense
that
he
did
not
suspect
he
was
not
surprised
that
his
pastor
should
present
the
christian
life
as
effectively
livable
by
bricklayers
and
business
men
as
surely
as
by
missionaries
he
had
heard
that
before
but
to
the
old
message
had
a
new
setting
a
new
force
and
never
before
had
he
been
so
ready
to
receive
it
the
songs
had
sung
themselves
out
as
the
fire
changed
from
roaring
flame
and
flying
sparks
to
a
great
bed
of
living
coals
from
the
beginning
a
glowing
hearth
has
been
perfect
focus
for
straight
thought
and
plain
speech
the
boys
found
it
so
this
night
the
minister
began
so
simply
that
it
seemed
almost
as
if
his
voice
were
only
the
musings
of
many
just
become
audible
i
know
said
he
that
some
of
you
will
find
yourselves
and
will
eagerly
offer
your
lives
for
religious
callings
we
shall
all
be
proud
of
you
and
glad
to
see
it
but
most
of
you
can
not
do
that
you
are
already
sure
that
you
must
be
content
to
live
christian
lives
it
is
possible
that
you
may
feel
a
little
out
of
the
picture
and
those
who
are
hearing
a
special
call
might
regard
you
quite
unconsciously
of
course
as
not
exactly
on
their
level
now
suppose
we
get
this
thing
straight
there
is
no
great
nor
small
no
high
nor
low
in
real
service
the
differences
are
only
in
the
forms
of
work
you
do
the
quality
may
be
just
as
fine
in
one
place
as
in
another
the
boy
who
goes
into
the
ministry
or
who
becomes
a
medical
missionary
will
have
peculiar
chances
for
usefulness
so
also
will
the
boy
who
goes
into
business
or
farming
or
teaching
or
any
other
secular
occupation
just
because
he
is
not
called
to
religious
work
as
a
daily
business
he
dare
not
think
that
he
has
no
call
calling
is
not
for
the
few
but
for
the
many
and
just
now
the
man
who
puts
his
whole
soul
into
being
an
christian
in
his
daily
business
and
in
his
personal
life
as
a
responsible
citizen
must
have
the
genuine
missionary
spirit
he
must
live
like
a
prophet
that
is
a
messenger
from
god
he
must
know
the
christian
meaning
of
all
that
happens
in
the
world
and
he
must
stand
for
the
whole
christian
program
otherwise
not
all
the
ministers
and
missionaries
in
the
world
can
save
our
civilization
it
is
your
chance
of
a
great
career
you
who
will
make
up
the
rank
and
file
of
the
christian
army
in
the
next
years
do
you
know
what
you
are
are
the
hope
of
the
world
as
the
group
broke
up
in
the
dim
light
of
the
dying
embers
stumbled
into
joe
carbrook
and
the
two
headed
for
the
tents
together
they
had
been
on
a
much
more
friendly
footing
since
thursday
say
said
joe
abruptly
what
the
matter
with
me
i
came
to
this
place
without
knowing
just
why
thought
i
just
have
a
good
time
i
suppose
but
here
i
am
being
bumped
up
against
something
new
and
big
every
little
while
until
i
wonder
if
it
the
same
world
that
i
was
living
in
before
i
came
do
you
suppose
anybody
else
feels
that
way
is
it
the
place
or
the
people
or
what
i
do
just
know
said
trying
to
keep
from
showing
his
surprise
i
feel
a
good
deal
that
way
myself
i
think
it
maybe
that
this
is
the
first
time
we
ever
been
forced
to
look
squarely
at
some
of
the
things
that
seem
so
natural
here
at
home
it
easy
to
dodge
you
know
that
only
you
dodged
one
way
and
i
done
it
another
but
do
you
feel
different
the
way
i
do
do
you
feel
like
saying
to
yourself
here
joe
carbrook
quit
being
a
fool
see
what
you
could
do
if
you
settled
down
to
getting
ready
for
something
real
like
being
a
doctor
now
do
feel
that
way
you
do
know
it
but
i
always
thought
i
could
be
a
doctor
if
i
could
see
anything
in
it
and
then
the
other
side
of
me
speaks
up
and
says
carbrook
kid
yourself
you
know
you
have
got
the
nerve
to
try
even
if
you
had
the
grit
to
stick
it
through
is
it
that
way
with
you
paid
more
attention
to
religion
and
all
that
than
i
ever
did
and
what
you
said
on
thursday
about
the
idea
has
kept
me
guessing
ever
since
no
joe
my
trouble
not
like
yours
i
know
i
ca
be
a
doctor
nor
a
preacher
nor
a
missionary
i
got
nothing
of
that
in
me
but
what
we
heard
at
the
camp
fire
came
straight
at
me
as
i
tried
to
say
the
other
day
if
you
get
the
idea
of
the
institute
christian
service
looks
like
a
great
life
but
me
i
no
hope
to
be
anything
particular
just
one
of
the
crowd
and
i
never
quite
saw
until
how
that
might
be
a
great
life
too
as
they
were
parting
ventured
a
bold
suggestion
say
joe
if
you
think
you
could
be
a
doctor
not
a
missionary
doctor
joe
answer
was
a
swift
turning
on
his
heel
and
he
strode
away
with
never
a
word
probably
made
him
mad
thought
i
wonder
why
i
said
it
joe
the
last
boy
in
the
world
to
have
any
such
notion
but
well
already
begun
to
happen
to
him
that
sure
and
to
me
too
on
sunday
the
little
world
of
the
institute
assumed
a
new
and
no
less
attractive
aspect
everybody
was
dressed
for
sunday
as
at
home
classes
were
over
and
games
also
the
dining
room
became
for
the
first
time
a
place
of
comparative
quiet
with
now
and
then
the
singing
of
a
great
old
hymn
just
to
voice
the
institute
consciousness
the
morning
watch
talk
had
been
a
little
more
direct
a
little
more
tense
and
before
the
bishop
sermon
came
the
love
feast
now
the
methodists
of
the
older
generation
made
much
of
their
love
feasts
but
in
these
days
except
at
the
annual
conference
an
occasional
institute
is
almost
the
only
place
where
it
flourishes
with
something
of
the
ancient
fervor
many
changes
have
come
to
methodism
since
the
great
days
of
the
love
feast
changes
of
custom
and
thought
and
speech
but
your
ardent
young
methodist
of
any
period
chaplain
mccabe
peter
cartwright
jesse
lee
captain
webb
would
have
understood
and
gloried
in
this
institute
love
feast
it
spoke
their
speech
our
group
from
delafield
will
never
forget
it
nearly
all
of
them
spoke
marcia
dayne
first
because
she
was
usually
expected
to
lead
in
everything
of
the
sort
then
marty
then
and
last
of
all
and
most
astounding
joe
carbrook
marty
looked
the
soldier
and
he
put
his
confession
into
military
terms
he
spoke
about
his
captain
and
waiting
for
orders
and
a
new
understanding
of
obedience
before
got
his
chance
to
speak
the
leader
read
a
night
letter
from
an
institute
far
away
conveying
the
greetings
of
six
hundred
young
people
to
their
fellow
epworthians
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
in
terms
of
personal
experience
he
was
still
under
the
spell
of
last
night
camp
fire
and
his
brief
encounter
with
joe
carbrook
but
without
quite
knowing
what
could
possibly
come
of
all
that
and
the
telegram
gave
him
an
excuse
to
speak
in
another
vein
you
must
remember
that
up
to
now
he
had
been
wholly
local
in
his
league
interests
he
had
gone
to
no
conventions
he
was
not
a
reader
of
epworth
and
to
him
the
central
office
was
as
though
it
had
not
been
i
wonder
if
anybody
else
feels
as
i
do
he
said
about
this
league
of
ours
until
this
last
week
i
never
thought
much
about
it
but
we
just
heard
that
telegram
from
an
institute
bigger
than
this
a
thousand
miles
off
and
there
or
sixty
institutes
going
on
this
year
besides
the
winter
institutes
the
conventions
and
all
the
other
gatherings
we
seem
to
belong
to
a
movement
that
enrolls
almost
a
million
young
people
with
all
sorts
of
chances
to
learn
how
it
can
do
all
sorts
of
christian
work
by
actually
it
this
is
the
only
thing
i
found
out
here
but
it
makes
me
want
to
see
the
whole
league
become
as
good
as
it
is
big
i
do
want
to
be
dazzled
by
the
size
of
it
because
i
know
how
many
other
members
are
just
as
little
use
as
been
only
when
i
get
home
i
hope
i
going
to
be
a
different
sort
of
an
epworthian
and
i
ca
help
wishing
that
we
all
felt
that
way
about
being
more
good
in
the
league
we
can
make
it
a
hundred
times
more
useful
to
the
church
and
to
our
master
many
others
spoke
like
that
some
of
them
because
they
could
find
nothing
more
intimate
to
say
some
here
and
there
those
who
like
could
not
quite
trust
themselves
yet
to
talk
of
their
deeper
personal
experiences
and
then
joe
carbrook
arose
he
spoke
easily
as
joe
always
did
but
it
was
a
new
joe
carbrook
and
only
the
delafield
delegation
understood
how
amazing
was
the
change
this
institute
has
made
me
all
sorts
of
trouble
he
said
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
without
caring
anything
about
it
except
to
get
some
new
fun
out
of
it
i
came
along
intending
to
stir
up
some
of
you
if
i
could
and
i
knew
i
could
but
i
seen
what
a
fool
i
was
every
day
i
seen
that
a
little
more
distinctly
and
last
night
just
as
i
was
leaving
one
of
the
boys
after
the
camp
fire
he
said
something
about
what
i
might
do
with
my
life
i
do
know
how
seriously
he
meant
it
maybe
he
does
either
i
went
off
without
answering
him
there
any
answer
except
that
i
knew
i
was
fit
even
to
think
about
it
and
then
thank
god
i
met
a
man
who
understood
what
was
wrong
with
me
our
pastor
i
have
been
anything
but
trouble
to
him
at
home
but
that
made
no
difference
to
him
and
he
introduced
me
down
yonder
by
the
lake
to
a
friend
i
had
never
known
before
some
one
infinitely
understanding
infinitely
forgiving
he
showed
me
that
before
i
could
find
what
i
ought
to
be
i
have
to
come
to
terms
with
that
friend
and
i
have
whatever
happens
to
me
whatever
i
may
find
to
do
i
want
now
and
here
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
confess
jesus
christ
as
my
saviour
and
lord
the
bishop
preached
a
great
sermon
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
delafield
delegation
rightly
appreciated
it
they
were
too
much
occupied
with
the
incredible
fact
that
joe
carbrook
had
been
converted
and
had
openly
confessed
it
more
was
to
come
the
afternoon
meeting
long
established
in
the
institute
world
as
the
life
work
service
was
in
the
hands
of
a
few
leaders
who
knew
both
its
power
and
peril
an
invitation
would
be
given
for
all
to
declare
their
purpose
who
felt
called
to
special
christian
work
the
difficulty
was
to
encourage
the
most
timid
of
those
who
despite
their
timidity
felt
sure
of
the
inner
voice
and
yet
prevent
a
stampede
among
those
who
without
any
depth
of
desire
were
in
love
with
emotion
and
would
enjoy
being
conspicuous
if
only
for
the
brief
moment
of
the
service
for
once
a
woman
made
the
address
a
wise
woman
let
it
be
said
who
made
skillful
and
sure
distinctions
between
the
christian
life
as
a
life
and
the
work
of
the
christian
church
as
one
way
of
living
that
life
it
would
have
been
a
successful
afternoon
in
any
case
but
three
incidents
helped
the
speaker
when
she
asked
those
to
declare
themselves
who
had
decided
for
definite
christian
work
young
people
in
all
parts
of
the
room
arose
and
one
after
another
they
spoke
for
the
most
part
simply
and
modestly
of
their
hope
and
purpose
and
joe
carbrook
was
among
them
he
said
very
little
the
nub
of
it
being
that
he
had
always
thought
of
being
a
doctor
but
not
until
a
chance
remark
made
by
john
wesley
last
night
had
the
idea
appeared
to
him
important
just
to
make
one
more
among
the
thousands
of
doctors
in
america
was
one
thing
he
said
it
was
quite
another
to
think
of
being
the
only
physician
among
a
great
helpless
population
but
to
be
a
missionary
doctor
a
man
had
to
be
first
a
missionary
and
how
could
he
be
a
missionary
if
he
were
not
a
christian
well
as
he
had
confessed
at
the
love
feast
that
was
settled
last
night
and
as
soon
as
it
had
been
attended
to
be
knew
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
way
so
he
must
work
now
toward
being
a
medical
missionary
joe
declaration
stirred
the
whole
assembly
and
while
the
influence
of
it
was
still
on
them
saw
martin
luther
shenk
his
classmate
and
doubly
his
chum
since
a
memorable
day
of
the
preceding
october
get
up
and
quietly
announce
his
purpose
of
becoming
a
minister
and
i
hope
said
marty
that
i
may
find
my
lifework
in
some
of
the
new
home
mission
fields
we
have
been
learning
about
this
week
at
that
point
the
leader
felt
more
than
a
little
anxious
these
two
decisions
with
all
their
restraint
had
in
them
something
infectious
and
she
feared
lest
some
young
people
not
holding
themselves
perfectly
in
hand
might
be
moved
to
sentimental
and
unreflecting
declaration
if
there
had
been
any
such
danger
marcia
dayne
dispelled
it
she
was
all
aglow
with
a
new
joy
of
her
own
whose
secret
none
knew
but
herself
though
one
other
had
almost
dared
to
hope
he
could
guess
may
i
speak
she
asked
i
have
no
decision
to
make
for
myself
last
year
i
took
the
whenever
wherever
pledge
and
i
intend
to
keep
it
though
i
am
not
yet
sure
what
it
will
mean
but
i
know
a
boy
here
who
will
not
talk
unless
somebody
asks
him
and
there
a
reason
why
i
think
he
should
be
asked
please
may
we
hear
from
john
wesley
farwell
about
kind
of
a
call
taken
unawares
at
the
mention
of
his
name
was
still
at
a
loss
when
the
leader
seconded
marcia
invitation
and
the
knowledge
that
he
was
expected
to
say
something
unusual
did
not
make
for
but
he
understood
marcia
purpose
and
tried
to
pull
himself
together
miss
dayne
is
president
of
our
home
chapter
and
she
had
a
lot
to
do
with
my
coming
to
the
institute
he
began
she
has
heard
me
talk
since
i
found
out
a
little
about
the
institute
and
i
told
her
this
morning
something
of
what
joe
carbrook
and
i
had
discussed
last
night
after
the
camp
fire
well
to
get
to
the
point
i
think
she
wants
me
to
say
and
i
saying
it
to
myself
most
of
all
that
for
nearly
all
of
us
young
people
christian
lifework
must
mean
making
an
honest
living
doing
all
we
can
to
make
our
religion
count
at
home
and
then
backing
up
with
all
got
by
prayer
and
money
and
brains
all
these
others
like
joe
carbrook
and
marty
shenk
who
are
going
into
the
hardest
places
to
put
up
the
biggest
fight
that
in
them
we
just
got
to
do
it
or
be
quitters
as
phil
khamis
said
at
morning
watch
yesterday
we
have
has
come
to
us
by
the
goodness
of
christian
people
we
are
willing
to
be
the
last
links
of
that
chain
we
do
want
any
special
recognition
but
i
hope
the
bishop
and
the
general
secretary
and
the
dean
and
all
the
rest
of
the
league
leaders
will
know
they
can
count
on
us
just
as
we
know
they
can
count
on
these
friends
of
ours
who
have
just
become
life
service
volunteers
nobody
knows
what
might
have
happened
if
some
one
had
not
spoken
like
that
but
as
the
group
of
new
volunteers
stood
about
the
platform
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
the
other
young
people
instead
of
wandering
off
and
feeling
themselves
of
no
significance
came
crowding
about
them
to
say
to
them
fashion
something
of
what
little
speech
had
suggested
out
of
some
four
hundred
epworthians
enrolled
in
the
institute
about
forty
had
made
definite
decisions
but
certainly
not
less
than
two
hundred
more
had
also
faced
the
future
and
in
some
sort
had
made
a
new
contract
with
themselves
and
with
god
the
institute
ended
there
except
for
a
simple
vesper
service
after
the
evening
meal
and
on
monday
morning
the
whole
company
was
homeward
bound
the
delafield
delegation
had
separated
the
larger
group
went
home
by
train
but
joe
carbrook
insistence
was
not
to
be
withstood
so
and
marty
marcia
dayne
and
pastor
drury
were
joe
passengers
for
the
miles
between
institute
and
home
they
sang
they
cheered
they
yelled
the
institute
yells
they
lived
over
the
crowded
days
of
the
week
that
had
so
swiftly
passed
but
most
of
all
they
deeply
resolved
that
so
far
as
they
could
help
to
do
it
while
they
were
at
home
the
league
chapter
of
delafield
should
be
made
over
into
something
of
more
use
to
the
church
to
which
it
belonged
it
was
marty
who
put
their
purpose
into
the
fewest
words
we
and
the
others
who
have
been
to
the
institute
do
think
we
know
every
little
league
thing
said
he
and
we
do
think
we
are
the
whole
league
either
but
every
time
anybody
in
our
chapter
starts
anything
good
going
to
have
more
and
better
help
than
he
ever
had
before
which
thing
came
to
pass
as
may
one
day
be
recorded
the
rev
walter
drury
kept
his
own
counsel
but
he
knew
that
more
had
happened
than
the
putting
of
new
life
into
the
league
the
experiment
had
progressed
safely
through
some
most
difficult
stages
chapter
ii
john
wesley
bringing
up
those
words
of
phil
khamis
at
morning
watch
kept
popping
into
head
in
the
days
following
the
institute
everything
i
have
has
come
to
me
by
the
goodness
of
christian
people
i
know
that
must
be
true
he
would
say
to
himself
but
it
worth
tracing
back
the
preacher
was
coming
over
to
supper
one
night
as
he
loved
to
do
and
made
up
his
mind
to
bring
phil
idea
into
the
table
talk
he
was
on
even
better
terms
with
the
preacher
than
he
used
to
be
mother
had
said
much
about
the
institute
though
she
had
listened
eagerly
to
all
his
talk
of
the
crowded
week
and
she
was
vaguely
ill
at
ease
she
had
hoped
for
something
she
did
not
know
just
what
from
the
institute
and
she
was
not
yet
sure
whether
she
ought
to
feel
disappointed
but
she
provided
a
fine
supper
to
which
the
menfolk
paid
the
most
practical
and
sincere
of
all
compliments
and
since
nobody
had
anything
else
on
for
the
evening
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
talk
the
mother
had
a
moment
aside
with
the
minister
and
there
was
a
touch
of
anxiety
in
her
question
do
you
think
the
institute
helped
my
boy
and
the
pastor
had
just
time
to
whisper
back
it
helped
him
much
but
he
gave
even
more
help
than
he
got
you
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
him
i
am
he
growing
it
was
not
very
definite
but
it
brought
no
small
comfort
to
the
mother
heart
this
institute
idea
seems
to
be
everywhere
said
to
the
pastor
but
how
did
it
get
started
i
used
to
be
in
the
epworth
league
but
we
had
nothing
like
it
then
that
not
so
very
much
of
a
story
said
the
pastor
we
have
the
institute
idea
because
we
had
to
have
it
and
so
the
league
gave
it
form
and
substance
well
chimed
in
i
think
it
about
time
more
people
knew
about
it
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
explain
it
ever
since
we
came
back
from
the
institute
the
pastor
nodded
i
know
but
remember
even
you
were
not
really
interested
until
you
had
been
at
an
institute
do
you
think
our
institute
just
happened
i
know
it
did
replied
somebody
did
a
lot
of
planning
and
scheming
yes
returned
the
pastor
but
did
you
notice
that
a
large
part
of
its
work
touched
subjects
familiar
to
you
the
local
league
activities
for
instance
the
devotional
meeting
and
mission
study
and
stewardship
and
the
scope
of
the
business
meeting
which
not
so
long
ago
elected
you
to
membership
yes
you
right
though
i
do
see
anything
remarkable
in
that
it
was
a
league
institute
was
it
certainly
but
still
if
there
had
not
been
any
local
chapter
there
could
have
been
no
institute
do
you
see
what
i
mean
is
that
the
institute
came
because
your
chapter
needed
it
and
you
needed
it
not
because
the
institute
needed
you
it
merely
a
matter
of
tracing
things
back
thought
of
phil
words
sure
enough
he
responded
tracing
things
back
makes
a
lot
of
difference
i
been
going
over
what
phil
khamis
said
at
the
morning
watch
you
remember
how
everything
he
has
has
come
to
him
by
the
goodness
of
christian
people
at
first
i
thought
that
was
no
more
than
a
description
of
his
particular
case
because
i
knew
how
true
it
was
but
when
you
begin
to
trace
things
back
as
you
say
what
true
about
phil
is
true
about
all
of
us
anyway
about
me
how
is
that
son
farwell
asked
gently
well
i
mean
smilingly
answered
her
though
flushing
a
little
too
the
institute
that
seemed
to
me
something
new
and
different
is
really
tied
up
to
what
you
folks
and
the
whole
church
have
been
doing
for
me
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
and
so
they
talked
parents
and
pastor
and
quite
naturally
and
freely
of
the
long
chain
of
interest
which
had
linked
his
life
to
the
church
life
back
through
all
the
years
to
his
babyhood
had
been
in
the
league
only
a
year
or
two
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
in
the
church
always
and
the
memories
of
his
boyhood
which
had
the
church
for
center
were
intimately
interwoven
with
all
his
other
experiences
as
his
father
said
i
guess
pastor
if
you
tried
to
take
out
of
young
life
all
that
the
church
has
meant
to
him
it
would
puzzle
a
professor
to
explain
whatever
might
be
left
had
been
born
in
the
country
on
a
farm
whose
every
tree
and
fence
corner
he
still
loved
his
first
recollections
of
the
church
as
part
of
his
life
had
to
do
with
the
sunday
morning
drive
to
the
little
meetinghouse
which
stood
where
the
road
to
town
skirted
a
low
hill
it
had
on
one
side
stretching
back
to
the
rear
of
the
church
lot
and
some
sizeable
elms
and
maples
were
grouped
about
its
front
and
sides
it
was
a
structure
unless
you
counted
the
space
curtained
off
for
the
primary
class
as
always
did
for
back
of
this
curtain
protecting
folds
he
had
begun
his
career
as
a
sunday
school
pupil
and
had
made
his
first
friends
at
that
time
even
district
school
was
yet
a
year
ahead
of
him
with
its
wider
democratic
joys
and
griefs
and
its
larger
freedom
from
parental
oversight
when
was
six
going
on
seven
the
family
moved
to
delafield
though
retaining
ownership
of
the
farm
and
for
years
spent
nearly
every
saturday
on
the
old
place
in
free
and
blissful
association
with
the
shenk
children
whose
father
was
the
tenant
it
was
here
that
he
and
martin
luther
shenk
already
introduced
as
marty
being
of
the
same
age
had
sworn
eternal
friendship
a
vow
which
as
yet
showed
no
sign
whatever
of
the
ravages
of
time
there
were
three
other
children
ben
and
alice
and
jeannette
now
jeannette
was
only
two
years
younger
than
and
marty
but
through
most
of
the
years
when
was
going
every
week
to
the
farm
she
was
only
a
girl
and
far
behind
the
two
chums
by
all
the
exacting
standards
which
to
boys
are
more
than
law
but
there
came
a
time
reveling
in
reminiscences
before
so
patient
a
listener
as
the
preacher
though
it
was
an
old
story
rehearsed
how
he
had
served
for
years
as
superintendent
of
the
country
sunday
school
and
how
farwell
was
teacher
of
the
girls
bible
class
their
home
had
always
been
methodist
headquarters
he
said
as
methodists
usually
say
and
with
truth
when
they
moved
to
town
the
change
brought
no
loss
of
church
interest
the
farwells
merely
transferred
it
entire
to
delafield
first
church
first
being
more
a
title
than
a
numeral
since
there
was
no
second
but
first
church
had
not
a
few
progressive
saints
they
wanted
the
best
that
could
be
had
so
sunday
school
enthusiast
that
he
was
found
himself
in
a
new
place
of
opportunity
the
board
of
sunday
schools
at
chicago
had
been
asked
to
help
delafield
get
itself
in
line
with
the
best
ideas
and
methods
and
found
the
beginnings
at
least
of
sunday
school
science
in
active
operation
at
first
like
a
true
country
man
he
was
a
little
inclined
to
counsels
of
caution
but
in
his
country
sunday
school
work
he
had
acquired
such
strong
opinions
about
old
fogies
that
he
dreaded
being
thought
one
himself
and
that
how
it
happened
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
i
was
soon
reckoned
among
the
progressives
in
that
first
year
i
helped
win
their
fight
for
separate
departments
and
before
long
we
had
the
makings
of
a
real
graded
sunday
school
do
you
remember
mother
how
proud
you
were
when
young
there
was
graduated
from
the
primary
into
the
junior
department
all
this
was
before
pastor
drury
time
of
course
but
he
had
gone
through
the
same
experiences
in
other
pastorates
and
needed
not
to
have
anything
explained
how
long
have
we
had
a
class
in
our
sunday
school
he
asked
that
called
out
the
story
of
the
struggles
to
set
up
what
many
openly
called
a
useless
and
foolish
enterprise
the
sunday
school
was
chronically
short
of
teachers
and
yet
and
the
other
reformers
insisted
on
taking
out
of
the
regular
classes
the
best
teachers
in
the
school
and
a
score
of
the
most
promising
young
people
this
group
went
off
by
itself
into
a
remote
part
of
the
church
it
furnished
no
substitute
teachers
it
was
heard
of
at
all
and
loud
were
the
complaints
about
its
crippling
the
school
but
pastor
you
should
have
seen
the
difference
when
the
first
dozen
real
teachers
came
out
of
that
class
we
were
able
to
reorganize
the
whole
school
our
john
wesley
got
a
teacher
he
never
forget
and
of
course
we
kept
the
training
class
going
it
never
stopped
since
the
board
of
sunday
schools
has
given
us
the
courses
and
helped
us
keep
the
class
up
to
grade
in
its
work
and
you
know
what
sort
of
teachers
we
have
now
the
pastor
did
and
was
properly
thankful
in
some
of
his
other
pastorates
it
had
been
otherwise
to
his
sorrow
speaking
of
the
board
of
sunday
schools
the
elder
farwell
resumed
for
this
was
a
hobby
he
missed
no
chance
to
ride
it
made
all
the
difference
with
us
in
our
work
for
a
better
sunday
school
gave
us
expert
backing
you
know
and
i
notice
by
its
latest
annual
report
yes
i
always
get
a
copy
though
thinks
it
dry
reading
that
it
is
helping
sunday
schools
by
the
thousand
not
in
this
country
only
but
wherever
in
the
world
our
church
is
at
work
of
course
you
know
how
it
starts
sunday
schools
and
how
often
they
grow
into
churches
well
it
did
quite
do
that
here
but
this
church
is
a
sight
better
and
bigger
because
we
began
to
take
the
board
advice
when
we
did
it
was
a
good
thing
for
our
boy
and
many
another
boy
and
girl
that
the
board
woke
us
up
it
has
all
been
easy
work
though
the
minister
suggested
i
remember
that
when
i
came
i
found
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discontent
over
the
graded
lessons
sure
there
was
said
we
had
all
been
brought
up
on
the
uniform
lessons
and
most
of
us
thought
they
were
just
right
besides
we
rather
enjoyed
thinking
of
ourselves
as
keeping
step
with
the
whole
sunday
school
world
all
over
the
wide
earth
everybody
studying
the
same
scripture
on
the
same
sunday
and
that
was
a
big
idea
to
get
into
the
minds
of
christians
of
every
name
everywhere
yes
but
dad
put
in
what
was
the
good
of
it
if
the
lessons
did
fit
everybody
did
people
think
that
the
kids
in
the
primary
and
their
mothers
in
ma
class
ought
to
study
the
same
lesson
or
did
they
think
they
could
fit
the
same
lesson
to
everybody
by
the
different
notes
they
put
into
the
quarterlies
well
son
his
father
replied
i
reckon
we
thought
both
ways
and
not
so
sure
yet
that
it
ca
be
done
but
if
one
thing
more
than
another
reconciled
me
to
the
graded
lessons
it
was
that
they
made
being
a
sunday
school
teacher
a
good
deal
bigger
job
than
it
had
ever
been
it
was
harder
work
because
every
lesson
had
to
be
studied
by
the
teacher
and
in
a
different
way
from
what
was
thought
good
enough
in
the
old
days
and
i
for
anything
graded
lessons
or
whatever
that
make
people
take
sunday
school
teaching
more
seriously
then
farwell
ventured
to
take
up
the
story
it
was
about
that
time
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
drury
pastorate
that
joined
the
church
on
probation
much
to
her
surprise
and
humbling
i
had
even
thought
of
it
she
said
though
i
should
have
been
the
first
one
he
had
been
getting
ready
in
the
junior
league
as
i
very
well
knew
but
one
day
as
you
may
remember
brother
drury
did
for
that
day
was
the
real
beginning
of
this
story
you
made
an
invitation
at
the
end
of
a
real
simple
sermon
and
if
did
get
right
up
from
my
side
and
walk
straight
to
the
front
after
that
there
had
been
a
probationers
class
with
and
perhaps
twenty
others
meeting
the
pastor
every
week
for
straight
religious
teaching
so
that
at
easter
when
they
came
up
for
membership
what
with
their
sunday
school
and
junior
league
training
and
what
with
the
pastor
more
personal
instruction
they
were
able
to
pass
a
pretty
fair
examination
on
the
great
christian
truths
and
on
the
general
scheme
of
the
church
work
for
a
time
mother
was
a
trifle
disappointed
that
had
waited
for
the
big
revival
we
had
the
next
year
said
but
i
think
she
was
glad
afterward
yes
i
was
the
mother
said
you
see
i
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
in
revivals
and
i
do
yet
but
we
had
no
such
chance
to
get
the
right
christian
start
when
we
were
little
children
as
has
had
if
you
let
his
mother
say
so
and
that
made
a
revival
a
good
deal
more
important
to
us
when
our
church
did
get
ready
for
one
but
the
other
way
is
all
right
too
i
mother
enough
to
be
glad
has
known
some
of
the
experiences
the
boys
of
my
time
went
through
and
the
girls
as
well
he
no
worse
a
christian
for
having
been
right
in
the
church
ever
since
i
put
him
in
short
dresses
are
you
son
and
i
will
say
that
his
father
was
always
with
me
in
holding
to
the
promises
we
made
when
he
was
baptized
we
not
done
what
we
might
but
we
never
forgotten
that
those
promises
were
made
to
be
kept
felt
none
of
his
old
shrinking
from
such
talk
especially
since
the
institute
and
yet
he
had
the
healthy
boy
reluctance
to
discuss
himself
in
company
but
this
was
interesting
him
outside
himself
he
turned
to
the
pastor
that
what
i
meant
when
i
told
you
what
phil
said
i
all
for
the
church
and
church
people
and
church
ways
why
should
i
be
i
never
known
anything
else
i
remember
well
the
one
thing
i
did
like
when
it
first
came
along
and
that
was
the
new
sort
of
christmas
celebration
dad
and
the
others
planned
when
i
was
ten
or
eleven
you
know
what
christmas
means
to
such
kids
and
i
guess
we
were
all
selfish
together
because
we
did
use
our
heads
well
the
sunday
school
proposed
that
instead
of
us
all
getting
something
we
should
all
give
something
it
looked
pretty
cheap
to
us
little
fellows
at
first
and
our
teacher
had
all
he
could
do
to
hold
us
in
line
but
let
me
tell
you
every
boy
was
for
it
when
the
time
came
we
found
that
we
could
have
as
much
fun
giving
things
away
as
we
could
grabbing
things
and
anyway
nobody
really
cared
for
those
mosquito
net
stockings
filled
with
nuts
and
candy
and
one
orange
it
was
only
the
idea
of
getting
something
for
nothing
that
first
christmas
i
remember
our
class
dressed
up
as
delivery
boys
and
we
came
on
the
platform
with
enough
groceries
for
a
small
truck
load
that
we
had
bought
with
our
own
money
the
orphanage
got
next
day
and
one
class
was
dusty
millers
carrying
sacks
of
flour
and
another
put
on
a
stunt
of
searching
for
captain
kidd
treasure
and
they
found
a
keg
of
shining
coins
new
pennies
they
were
more
than
a
thousand
of
everything
went
to
the
orphanage
or
the
hospital
and
then
when
the
board
of
sunday
schools
began
to
get
us
interested
in
other
sunday
schools
and
in
missions
i
remember
a
scheme
they
call
a
plan
that
was
great
i
know
what
happened
to
it
i
got
right
into
the
game
every
time
how
do
you
happen
to
know
so
much
about
the
board
of
sunday
schools
asked
drury
oh
that
easy
you
know
how
it
is
in
our
sunday
school
they
make
one
or
two
of
us
young
fellows
serve
as
librarians
and
secretaries
and
such
and
miss
all
the
class
work
they
have
more
help
and
we
all
get
into
class
for
the
lesson
well
two
years
ago
dad
told
me
you
had
nominated
me
for
something
at
the
annual
sunday
school
meeting
it
was
only
a
sort
of
assistant
secretary
job
but
very
soon
i
began
to
catch
on
and
i
seen
a
lot
of
the
letters
and
leaflets
that
come
from
the
board
in
chicago
well
let
me
tell
you
that
board
of
sunday
schools
is
a
whale
of
a
machine
why
it
the
whole
church
at
work
to
make
better
sunday
schools
and
more
of
they
have
sunday
school
workers
in
all
sorts
of
wild
places
and
sunday
school
missionaries
in
foreign
lands
yes
and
last
year
i
happened
to
meet
one
of
their
secretaries
at
your
house
you
may
remember
but
you
never
think
he
was
just
a
secretary
he
was
so
keen
and
wide
awake
he
knew
the
boy
scouts
from
a
to
z
and
that
got
me
i
not
so
old
that
i
forgotten
my
scouting
and
he
knew
baseball
and
boys
books
and
all
that
do
you
think
brother
drury
if
more
of
the
fellows
knew
what
the
real
sunday
school
work
is
they
would
take
to
it
like
colts
to
a
bran
mash
they
could
help
it
said
the
pastor
and
you
may
have
noticed
that
your
father
and
the
other
people
of
our
sunday
school
board
are
trying
to
get
them
to
find
out
some
of
the
things
you
have
found
out
for
instance
you
know
what
the
two
organized
classes
of
freshmen
are
doing
and
the
other
organized
classes
seems
to
me
their
members
are
finding
out
that
sunday
school
is
something
big
and
fine
that
they
are
farwell
agreed
and
you
must
forget
my
wonderful
class
of
young
married
women
and
the
men
class
of
nearly
a
hundred
i
think
our
sunday
school
has
really
begun
to
change
the
ideas
of
a
lot
of
people
just
think
how
little
trouble
we
have
now
with
what
graded
lessons
we
have
and
how
happy
all
our
teachers
are
because
they
have
the
helps
they
need
for
just
the
sort
of
pupils
that
are
in
their
classes
that
so
said
i
do
suppose
even
old
brother
barnacle
as
he
is
would
vote
to
go
back
to
the
times
when
the
superintendent
reviewed
the
lesson
the
same
way
the
teachers
taught
it
from
a
printed
list
of
questions
seems
as
if
i
can
hear
henry
locke
yet
his
farm
joins
ours
down
by
the
creek
when
he
conducted
the
reviewing
at
deep
creek
he
would
hold
his
quarterly
at
arm
length
to
favor
his
eyes
and
then
look
up
from
it
to
the
school
and
shoot
the
question
at
everybody
what
did
peter
do
hey
he
sure
did
come
out
strong
on
peter
but
i
say
this
for
him
that
he
never
skipped
a
question
from
start
to
finish
all
three
laughed
a
little
over
henry
locke
and
then
the
pastor
said
he
must
stay
much
longer
but
he
did
want
to
back
up
belief
that
what
phil
khamis
had
said
was
true
of
everybody
we
are
all
debtors
look
at
this
young
here
will
you
he
said
to
the
father
and
mother
for
once
letting
himself
go
with
a
name
he
proud
of
and
a
home
life
that
many
a
fifth
avenue
and
lake
shore
drive
family
would
be
glad
to
pay
a
million
for
if
such
goods
were
on
sale
in
the
stores
going
to
tell
him
something
he
already
knows
young
man
and
there
was
a
gleam
in
the
pastor
eye
that
was
not
all
to
the
credit
of
the
work
he
was
praising
you
owe
a
big
debt
to
the
sunday
school
i
not
jealous
for
the
church
or
for
any
other
part
of
it
but
by
your
own
admission
the
sunday
school
has
had
a
lot
to
do
with
your
education
very
well
remember
it
is
a
part
of
what
phil
said
and
what
you
are
because
of
the
sunday
school
you
have
become
by
the
goodness
of
christian
people
i
do
think
you
forget
it
seeing
that
you
have
two
of
that
sort
of
people
in
your
own
home
all
the
time
and
then
with
a
fine
naturalness
the
little
group
knelt
by
the
chairs
and
two
of
the
four
he
who
was
pastor
of
the
whole
flock
and
he
who
with
simple
dignity
was
priest
in
his
own
household
gave
thanks
to
god
for
the
manifold
goodness
of
christian
people
of
which
they
were
all
partakers
every
day
as
he
went
home
walter
drury
thought
of
the
long
days
that
stretched
out
ahead
before
he
could
see
the
outcomes
of
the
great
experiment
but
this
night
had
seen
a
good
night
work
done
in
the
laboratory
and
he
was
content
one
tale
of
the
past
had
been
much
in
thought
that
night
but
nothing
on
earth
could
have
induced
him
to
talk
about
it
especially
since
the
happenings
at
the
institute
only
one
other
person
knew
all
of
its
inwardness
though
the
preacher
guessed
most
of
the
secret
pretty
shrewdly
and
everybody
was
familiar
with
its
outcome
it
was
the
story
of
marty
shenk
conversion
these
two
had
been
david
and
jonathan
from
their
little
boy
days
no
less
friends
because
they
were
so
unlike
marty
a
quiet
brooding
youngster
and
taking
things
as
they
came
and
asking
few
questions
but
always
the
leader
in
games
and
mischief
each
the
other
champion
against
all
comers
marty
father
on
the
farwell
farm
was
steady
enough
and
dependable
but
never
one
to
get
ahead
much
before
the
farwells
moved
to
town
he
had
rarely
stayed
on
the
same
farm
more
than
a
year
or
two
but
as
he
said
farwell
was
different
and
anybody
who
wanted
to
be
decent
could
get
along
with
him
so
for
many
saturdays
and
vacations
of
boyhood
years
and
marty
had
roamed
the
countryside
and
were
in
their
of
the
old
farm
marty
came
in
to
high
school
from
the
farm
and
often
he
stayed
with
over
the
weekend
his
school
work
was
uneven
ahead
in
mathematics
and
the
sciences
and
something
below
the
average
in
other
studies
that
however
has
no
place
in
this
story
of
course
he
and
were
thick
as
thieves
except
when
class
work
made
temporary
separations
necessary
they
lived
the
life
together
that
meant
also
for
these
two
the
social
life
of
the
church
which
occasionally
paid
special
attention
to
the
students
so
you
might
find
them
at
epworth
league
socials
sunday
school
class
doings
in
the
sunday
school
orchestra
violin
and
cornet
respectively
and
most
significant
of
all
in
its
effect
on
all
the
later
years
they
went
through
week
together
the
hand
of
the
pastor
was
in
that
too
marty
was
not
a
christian
had
been
a
church
member
for
years
and
early
in
his
course
he
had
faced
and
accepted
all
that
being
a
christian
seemed
to
mean
to
a
boy
there
had
been
hard
places
to
get
over
some
of
the
boys
and
girls
were
merciless
in
their
unconscious
tests
of
his
religion
some
were
openly
scornful
and
others
sought
by
indirect
and
furtive
means
to
break
his
influence
in
the
school
for
he
had
no
small
gift
of
leadership
and
he
cared
a
good
deal
that
it
should
count
for
the
decencies
of
life
by
senior
year
the
sort
of
trouble
that
a
christian
boy
encounters
in
school
was
almost
all
ended
but
it
had
been
more
through
his
dogged
resistance
to
opposition
than
because
of
any
special
zest
in
christian
service
and
then
came
the
announcement
of
week
with
confronted
by
two
stubborn
facts
he
had
only
one
real
chum
and
that
chum
was
not
a
christian
pastor
drury
had
let
fall
a
remark
a
month
before
the
week
to
the
effect
that
any
christian
who
had
a
chum
could
dodge
week
but
he
could
dodge
his
chum
when
the
week
was
past
the
chum
would
still
be
on
hand
think
as
he
would
there
was
no
honest
way
of
escape
from
whatever
those
facts
might
require
of
him
so
long
accustomed
to
go
ahead
and
take
what
came
had
known
himself
bound
by
the
obligations
of
this
matter
also
days
and
days
before
the
activities
of
week
began
the
two
were
out
one
saturday
on
the
north
road
they
had
been
up
to
the
woods
on
barker
hill
for
nuts
and
with
good
success
the
day
was
warm
the
way
was
long
and
there
was
no
hurry
when
they
came
to
the
roadside
at
the
wood
edge
they
sat
on
a
fallen
tree
and
talked
at
least
marty
did
for
was
not
himself
it
was
his
chance
and
he
knew
it
but
a
thousand
impulses
leaped
to
life
within
him
to
make
him
put
off
what
he
knew
he
ought
to
say
the
fear
of
being
misunderstood
even
by
marty
the
knowledge
that
marty
in
the
qualities
by
which
boys
judge
and
are
judged
was
quite
as
good
as
himself
and
above
all
his
sense
of
total
unfitness
to
be
a
pattern
of
the
christian
life
to
anybody
filled
him
with
an
uneasiness
that
actually
hurt
and
marty
soon
discovered
that
something
was
amiss
willing
as
he
was
to
do
his
full
share
of
the
talking
he
became
aware
that
except
for
inarticulate
commonplaces
he
was
having
to
do
it
all
what
the
matter
with
you
all
at
once
he
asked
you
not
taken
suddenly
sick
are
you
you
were
all
right
when
we
were
among
the
trees
you
sick
laughed
shortly
no
old
man
i
not
sick
but
i
up
against
a
new
game
for
me
and
i
not
in
training
sounds
interesting
said
marty
but
sort
of
mysterious
is
it
anything
i
can
do
on
it
surely
is
but
first
i
got
to
say
something
and
i
want
you
to
promise
that
you
wo
think
i
putting
on
or
butting
in
because
not
nothing
like
it
will
you
will
i
promise
said
marty
much
bewildered
course
i
promise
not
to
think
anything
about
you
that
you
do
want
me
to
think
but
i
must
say
i
do
know
within
a
thousand
miles
what
you
driving
at
out
with
it
and
even
if
you
the
train
bandit
who
held
up
the
cannonball
or
if
you
plotted
to
kidnap
the
board
of
education
i
never
tell
marty
quizzical
humor
was
not
making
enterprise
any
easier
he
had
always
supposed
that
what
the
leaflets
called
personal
evangelism
had
to
be
done
in
a
spirit
of
solemnity
but
how
was
he
to
acquire
the
proper
frame
of
mind
and
certainly
there
was
nothing
solemn
about
marty
just
now
yet
the
thing
had
gone
too
far
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
he
tried
to
think
how
drury
would
do
it
but
saw
only
that
if
it
was
mr
dairy
business
he
would
go
straight
to
the
center
of
it
desperately
therefore
he
plunged
in
well
marty
he
said
speaking
now
with
nervous
haste
what
i
up
against
is
this
what
the
matter
with
your
being
a
christian
he
will
never
forget
the
swift
look
of
blank
amazement
that
marty
turned
on
him
nor
the
flush
that
followed
the
first
astonished
start
for
marty
did
not
answer
and
turned
his
face
away
was
sure
that
in
his
blundering
bluntness
he
had
offended
and
probably
angered
his
closest
friend
the
distress
of
that
thought
served
at
least
to
drive
away
all
the
which
thus
far
had
plagued
him
say
marty
he
pleaded
putting
his
hand
on
the
other
arm
forget
it
if
i
hurt
your
feelings
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
i
not
fit
to
talk
about
such
things
to
anybody
and
honest
i
meant
nothing
but
to
say
what
i
knew
i
got
to
say
then
marty
turned
himself
back
slowly
and
saw
the
troubled
look
in
his
eyes
in
a
voice
that
trembled
despite
his
proud
effort
at
control
he
said
old
man
you
need
apologize
you
did
surprise
me
i
admit
i
was
looking
for
anything
like
this
it
all
right
though
and
i
certainly
not
mad
about
it
but
say
let
me
put
something
up
to
you
why
did
you
never
think
to
ask
me
that
question
before
why
it
was
this
way
began
somewhat
puzzled
at
the
form
of
the
question
and
still
thinking
he
must
set
himself
right
with
marty
you
know
the
epworth
league
is
planning
for
those
special
meetings
soon
week
and
i
been
asked
to
lead
one
of
the
meetings
but
you
can
see
that
i
would
be
ready
to
lead
a
meeting
like
that
unless
i
had
put
this
thing
of
being
a
christian
up
to
you
anyway
you
the
only
real
chum
i
got
drury
said
something
a
little
while
ago
that
made
it
mighty
plain
yes
said
marty
i
can
see
that
but
why
did
you
never
say
anything
to
me
about
it
when
there
was
any
meeting
coming
have
we
always
shared
everything
else
since
away
back
this
is
the
one
subject
that
you
and
i
have
kept
away
from
in
our
talk
of
all
we
ever
thought
about
and
i
was
wondering
why
well
i
do
exactly
know
replied
it
may
have
been
that
it
never
seemed
to
be
any
of
my
business
that
it
was
the
business
or
the
sunday
school
teacher
or
somebody
and
you
know
i
always
been
surer
of
what
you
really
are
than
i
have
of
myself
i
think
i
was
always
afraid
you
would
either
make
fun
of
me
or
believe
i
was
letting
on
to
be
better
than
you
were
but
when
the
league
got
into
this
plan
why
the
name
itself
was
an
and
seen
lately
that
a
fellow
got
to
be
a
christian
out
and
out
or
his
religion
is
no
good
and
when
i
heard
the
preacher
say
not
long
ago
that
a
fellow
might
dodge
week
but
he
could
forever
dodge
his
chum
i
knew
i
had
to
speak
to
you
but
you
sure
you
not
offended
let
me
admit
a
thing
to
you
i
never
said
so
before
but
been
wanting
somebody
to
ask
me
to
be
a
christian
for
a
long
time
i
was
a
coward
about
it
and
would
let
on
i
been
wanting
to
find
out
what
i
got
to
do
but
i
would
ask
do
you
think
i
be
a
christian
i
know
you
could
be
a
long
way
better
christian
than
i
am
answered
with
unwonted
feeling
and
if
you
did
take
jesus
christ
to
be
your
master
it
would
be
more
than
just
your
getting
religion
you
would
be
the
biggest
kind
of
for
me
and
for
other
people
i
know
of
it
the
one
thing
you
need
to
be
a
hundred
per
cent
right
i
a
pretty
poor
christian
myself
marty
partly
because
i
do
know
how
to
think
much
about
it
but
you
be
dead
in
earnest
to
get
all
that
there
is
in
the
christian
life
and
maybe
i
could
follow
along
behind
you
always
helped
every
other
way
and
i
always
wanted
you
to
help
me
be
a
genuine
christian
marty
put
his
hand
on
shoulder
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
you
got
me
rated
a
lot
too
high
he
said
how
can
i
help
you
but
we
two
have
been
pretty
good
chums
so
far
have
we
well
a
lot
to
settle
before
i
can
be
sure
i
a
christian
but
it
means
everything
for
you
to
think
i
can
be
of
some
use
and
i
promise
you
this
i
not
let
up
until
i
am
a
christian
and
we
stick
together
all
the
more
when
i
am
us
two
is
that
ago
it
was
a
go
was
ready
and
far
more
than
ready
to
call
it
a
go
it
had
been
easier
than
he
had
expected
but
then
it
had
all
been
so
different
from
the
vague
and
formal
thing
he
had
been
afraid
of
he
could
hardly
believe
but
he
had
one
request
to
make
i
know
settle
whatever
has
to
be
settled
he
said
a
bit
unsteadily
but
when
it
all
done
and
you
tell
people
about
it
as
i
know
you
will
please
marty
do
bring
me
into
it
publicly
i
mean
let
just
have
this
understanding
between
ourselves
i
can
lead
my
meeting
now
but
no
need
to
say
anything
about
me
besides
i
made
a
mess
of
it
it
may
be
the
best
mess
anybody
ever
stirred
up
for
me
but
i
wo
say
anything
to
worry
you
if
the
time
comes
for
me
to
say
anything
at
all
and
i
believe
it
will
it
did
marty
and
the
pastor
had
two
or
three
long
interviews
from
the
last
of
them
the
boy
came
away
with
a
new
light
on
his
face
and
a
new
spring
in
his
step
evidently
whatever
needed
to
be
settled
had
been
settled
he
kept
his
promise
to
his
chum
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
choosing
the
night
when
led
the
meeting
to
stand
up
at
the
first
opportunity
and
make
his
straightforward
confession
of
love
and
loyalty
since
god
had
made
him
a
sharer
in
the
life
that
is
in
christ
then
for
a
moment
feared
marty
might
forget
their
agreement
but
marty
said
simply
and
part
of
the
joy
that
is
in
my
heart
is
because
there
is
a
new
tie
the
only
other
one
we
needed
between
myself
and
my
chum
the
leader
of
this
meeting
in
the
back
of
the
room
walter
drury
quietly
looking
on
sent
up
a
silent
thanksgiving
the
great
experiment
was
going
well
chapter
iii
campus
days
so
it
was
that
and
marty
had
come
into
the
inner
places
of
each
other
lives
of
all
the
developments
of
institute
week
naturally
the
one
which
filled
thoughts
with
a
sort
of
awed
gladness
was
marty
decision
to
offer
himself
for
the
ministry
joe
was
much
more
dramatic
for
saw
when
the
decision
was
made
that
marty
could
not
have
been
meant
for
anything
but
a
preacher
it
was
as
fit
as
you
please
as
to
joe
previous
opinion
had
been
pretty
equally
divided
one
side
leaning
to
the
idea
that
he
might
make
a
lawyer
and
the
other
predicting
that
he
was
more
likely
to
be
a
perpetual
and
profitable
client
for
some
other
lawyer
in
the
light
of
the
institute
happenings
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
question
of
college
would
promptly
become
a
practical
matter
to
four
delafield
people
marty
was
greatly
troubled
for
he
knew
if
he
was
to
be
a
preacher
he
must
go
to
college
and
he
could
see
how
felt
no
great
urge
though
it
had
always
been
understood
that
he
would
go
marcia
dayne
had
one
year
of
normal
school
to
her
credit
and
would
take
another
next
year
perhaps
but
this
year
she
must
teach
joe
carbrook
spent
little
time
in
debate
with
himself
he
let
everybody
know
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
missionary
doctor
and
that
he
would
go
to
the
state
university
for
the
rest
of
his
college
course
but
what
about
the
religious
influence
of
the
university
marcia
dayne
had
ventured
to
ask
him
one
evening
as
they
walked
slowly
under
the
elms
of
monroe
avenue
i
do
know
about
that
joe
answered
and
maybe
i
making
a
mistake
but
i
do
think
so
to
begin
with
there
is
any
question
about
equipment
at
the
state
university
they
have
everything
any
church
school
has
and
probably
more
than
most
church
schools
for
what
i
want
and
they
work
in
close
relationship
to
the
medical
school
that
one
thing
the
big
reason
though
i
wonder
if
you
understand
it
i
believe
i
could
understand
anything
you
might
be
thinking
about
now
joe
and
marcia
voice
had
in
it
a
note
which
stirred
that
usually
young
man
out
of
all
his
easy
composure
i
remember
that
marcia
he
said
in
the
thrill
of
a
swift
elation
i
remember
that
because
i
think
you
do
understand
and
some
day
i
but
i
got
at
least
five
years
of
plugging
ahead
of
me
and
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
your
big
reason
for
going
to
the
state
university
marcia
broke
in
though
she
wondered
afterward
if
her
instinct
had
not
played
her
false
yes
joe
said
with
a
little
effort
well
this
is
it
you
know
i
did
make
much
of
a
hit
at
college
i
pulled
through
sophomore
year
but
that
about
all
and
i
doubt
if
the
faculty
will
pass
resolutions
of
regret
when
i
do
show
up
there
in
the
fall
the
religious
influences
of
a
church
school
did
prevent
me
from
being
a
good
deal
of
a
heathen
though
i
will
say
that
was
no
fault
of
the
school
maybe
i
ought
to
go
back
and
face
the
music
it
would
be
so
bad
i
guess
but
i
feel
more
like
making
a
clean
new
start
in
a
new
place
the
state
university
would
be
any
worse
for
me
than
i
should
be
for
it
if
nothing
had
happened
to
change
my
point
of
view
so
that
is
the
issue
but
if
the
state
university
life
is
able
to
beat
me
before
i
get
to
sawing
bones
at
all
i
make
a
pretty
missionary
doctor
if
i
ever
landed
in
foreign
parts
would
i
marcia
could
find
nothing
to
say
perhaps
because
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
other
and
more
personal
aspects
of
joe
plans
for
the
future
and
as
joe
people
were
completely
oblivious
to
everything
except
the
startling
change
that
had
come
over
him
and
were
abundantly
able
to
send
him
to
three
universities
at
once
if
necessary
joe
carbrook
was
as
good
as
enrolled
marty
and
did
not
find
the
future
opening
up
before
them
so
easily
marty
for
all
he
could
not
imagine
the
way
opening
before
such
as
himself
was
all
eagerness
about
the
nearest
methodist
school
which
happened
to
be
the
one
where
the
institute
had
been
held
cartwright
college
it
was
named
as
may
be
supposed
in
honor
of
peter
cartwright
that
pioneer
methodist
preacher
who
became
famous
on
the
same
sort
of
schooling
which
sufficed
for
abraham
lincoln
and
once
ran
against
lincoln
himself
for
congress
was
not
specially
eager
to
look
for
a
college
education
anywhere
why
should
he
be
since
he
was
expecting
to
go
into
business
the
two
had
many
a
discussion
marty
arguing
in
favor
of
college
for
everybody
and
admitting
that
for
preachers
and
teachers
and
lawyers
and
doctors
it
was
necessary
but
what
use
could
it
be
in
business
but
say
you
not
going
to
be
one
of
these
a
man
died
a
grocer
sort
of
business
men
urged
marty
that
your
future
with
a
knowledge
of
more
than
markets
and
look
at
the
personal
side
of
college
life
have
you
heard
drury
say
that
if
he
anything
else
to
show
for
his
four
years
at
college
than
the
lifelong
friendships
he
made
there
it
would
have
been
worth
all
it
cost
and
you
have
reason
to
know
he
does
forget
the
studies
that
all
right
marty
rejoined
i
do
need
much
convincing
on
that
score
i
can
see
the
good
times
too
you
know
i
try
for
all
the
athletics
i
could
get
into
and
i
guess
i
could
keep
my
end
up
socially
but
is
all
that
worth
my
time
for
the
next
four
years
studying
subjects
that
would
be
no
earthly
good
to
me
in
business
in
making
a
living
i
mean
the
other
boys
in
hardware
stores
would
have
four
years
the
start
of
me
but
do
you
remember
what
our
commencement
speaker
said
on
that
very
point
he
told
us
we
had
to
be
men
and
women
first
no
matter
what
occupations
we
got
into
and
he
bore
down
hard
on
how
it
was
a
good
deal
bigger
business
to
make
a
life
than
to
make
a
living
in
these
days
the
most
dangerous
people
to
themselves
and
to
all
of
us
are
the
uneducated
people
yes
i
remember
admitted
and
social
values
of
education
he
called
that
did
he
and
that
what
i
not
sure
of
it
seems
pretty
foggy
to
me
but
old
man
you
going
that
settled
and
maybe
i
just
let
dad
send
me
to
keep
you
company
if
i
ca
find
any
better
reason
that
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
marty
retorted
with
the
least
little
touch
of
resentment
in
his
tone
you
your
dad
send
you
my
dad
ca
send
me
though
he
do
all
he
able
to
do
and
how
i
can
earn
enough
to
get
through
is
more
than
i
can
see
from
here
but
asserted
confidently
there
a
way
just
the
same
and
i
think
i
know
how
to
find
out
about
it
i
have
been
a
second
assistant
deputy
secretary
in
the
sunday
school
for
nothing
you
reminded
me
of
the
commencement
address
i
ask
you
if
you
remember
children
day
it
came
the
very
next
sunday
yes
i
remember
it
but
what
of
it
well
my
boy
we
took
up
a
collection
for
you
we
did
not
much
we
did
and
anyway
do
you
think
i
accept
that
sort
of
help
i
not
looking
for
charity
yet
and
marty
showed
the
hurt
he
felt
steady
martin
luther
i
would
want
you
to
get
that
collection
anyway
it
was
near
big
enough
but
do
you
know
that
every
children
day
collection
in
the
whole
church
goes
to
the
board
of
education
and
that
it
has
become
a
big
fund
never
to
be
given
away
but
always
to
be
loaned
to
students
getting
ready
to
be
preachers
and
such
it
no
charity
it
the
same
business
you
want
me
to
go
to
college
for
i
can
see
that
much
without
getting
any
nearer
to
college
than
the
delafield
first
church
sunday
school
you
borrow
the
money
just
as
if
you
stepped
up
to
a
bank
window
and
you
agree
to
pay
it
back
as
soon
as
you
can
after
you
graduate
then
it
goes
into
the
fund
again
and
some
other
boy
or
girl
borrows
it
and
so
on
more
than
thousand
students
have
borrowed
from
this
fund
about
fifteen
hundred
of
got
loans
last
year
ask
the
preacher
if
i
not
giving
you
this
straight
marty
had
no
immediate
way
of
testing
this
unusual
wealth
of
information
so
he
said
well
maybe
there
something
in
it
i
talk
to
brother
drury
about
it
anyway
that
observing
man
was
quite
willing
to
be
talked
to
when
marty
presented
himself
at
the
study
a
few
days
later
he
found
the
pastor
as
well
prepared
as
if
he
had
been
expecting
some
such
interview
as
indeed
he
had
he
told
marty
the
story
of
the
student
loan
fund
how
it
originated
in
the
celebration
of
the
centenary
of
american
methodism
in
and
how
it
had
been
growing
all
through
the
years
both
by
the
annual
day
offering
and
by
the
increasing
return
of
loans
from
former
students
then
he
explained
that
this
fund
and
many
other
educational
affairs
were
in
the
hands
of
the
church
board
of
education
this
board
marty
heard
is
a
sort
of
educational
clearing
house
for
the
whole
church
and
especially
for
methodist
schools
of
higher
learning
it
helps
young
people
to
go
to
college
and
it
helps
the
colleges
to
take
care
of
the
young
people
when
they
go
of
course
always
using
money
which
has
come
from
the
churches
it
has
charge
of
a
group
of
special
schools
in
the
south
and
it
sets
the
scholastic
standards
to
which
all
the
schools
and
colleges
must
conform
besides
looking
out
for
these
interests
it
helps
the
school
to
provide
courses
in
the
bible
and
christian
principles
and
it
furnishes
workers
to
serve
the
colleges
in
caring
for
the
religious
life
of
the
students
marty
listened
carefully
and
with
no
lack
of
interest
but
when
the
minister
paused
the
boy
mind
sprang
back
to
his
own
particular
concern
but
drury
can
any
student
borrow
money
from
that
fund
well
no
said
the
preacher
not
every
student
only
those
who
are
preparing
for
the
ministry
or
for
other
careers
of
special
service
they
have
to
show
that
the
loan
will
help
them
in
preparing
to
be
of
some
definite
christian
value
when
they
graduate
that
wo
affect
you
you
can
borrow
not
all
you
could
use
perhaps
but
enough
to
be
a
big
help
how
much
do
you
expect
to
need
why
answered
marty
i
hardly
know
i
had
really
thought
it
possible
i
could
go
but
dad
says
he
let
me
have
all
he
can
and
they
tell
me
a
fellow
can
get
work
to
do
if
he
not
particular
about
easy
jobs
i
pretty
sure
i
could
manage
except
for
tuition
and
books
but
then
you
may
as
well
consider
it
settled
said
the
pastor
cartwright
college
will
welcome
you
on
those
terms
or
i
know
the
reason
why
and
i
think
you
can
count
on
going
with
you
was
not
hard
to
convince
his
parents
were
all
for
it
the
pastor
had
no
intention
of
overdoing
his
own
part
in
the
affair
and
contented
himself
with
a
suggestion
that
disposed
of
main
objection
had
been
saying
to
him
one
day
i
know
i
should
have
a
good
time
at
college
but
i
should
be
four
years
later
getting
into
business
than
the
other
boys
that
depends
on
what
means
replied
drury
you
would
not
need
four
years
to
catch
up
if
college
does
for
you
what
i
think
it
will
besides
you
intending
to
be
a
christian
citizen
i
take
it
and
that
will
be
even
more
of
a
job
than
to
be
a
successful
hardware
man
colleges
have
been
operating
these
many
years
to
give
young
people
the
best
possible
preparations
for
a
whole
life
remember
what
john
milton
said
i
care
not
how
late
i
come
so
i
come
fit
you
want
to
come
to
your
work
as
fit
as
they
make
do
you
and
owned
up
that
he
did
i
do
mean
to
be
a
dub
in
business
and
i
no
right
to
be
a
dub
anywhere
me
for
cartwright
brother
drury
another
day
work
in
the
laboratory
walter
drury
knew
how
to
be
patient
yet
every
experience
like
this
was
a
tonic
to
his
soul
and
now
he
must
be
content
for
a
time
to
let
others
carry
the
work
through
its
next
stages
though
he
would
hold
himself
ready
for
any
unexpected
development
that
might
arise
so
it
befell
that
and
marty
started
to
cartwright
and
a
week
later
joe
carbrook
went
off
to
the
state
university
the
day
after
they
had
matriculated
and
marty
were
putting
their
room
to
rights
oh
yes
they
thought
it
would
be
well
to
share
the
same
room
and
as
they
puttered
about
they
reviewed
the
happenings
of
the
first
day
they
had
made
a
preliminary
exploration
of
the
grounds
and
buildings
revisiting
the
places
which
had
become
familiar
during
institute
week
and
living
over
that
crowded
and
epochal
time
marty
scouting
around
for
something
to
do
had
discovered
that
he
could
get
work
such
as
it
was
for
ten
hours
a
week
anyway
and
maybe
more
at
thirty
to
fifty
cents
an
hour
he
had
a
little
money
left
after
paying
his
tuition
and
the
college
registrar
assured
him
that
the
loan
from
the
board
of
education
would
be
forthcoming
therefore
the
talk
turned
on
money
that
tuition
bill
sure
reduced
the
swelling
in
my
pocketbook
marty
remarked
as
he
examined
his
visible
resources
what
do
you
think
it
did
to
mine
marty
observed
quietly
i
still
giddy
from
being
relieved
of
so
much
money
in
one
operation
and
yet
i
ca
see
how
they
get
along
look
at
the
big
faculty
they
have
and
all
these
buildings
to
keep
up
and
keep
going
when
i
think
of
how
big
a
dollar
seems
to
me
the
tuition
looks
like
the
national
debt
of
mexico
but
when
i
try
to
figure
out
how
much
it
costs
the
college
per
student
i
feel
as
though
i
were
paying
prices
for
a
dinner
how
they
do
it
who
told
you
i
was
to
be
looked
on
in
the
light
of
a
world
almanac
my
son
i
could
give
you
the
answer
to
that
question
without
getting
out
of
my
chair
but
for
one
small
difficulty
i
just
do
know
tell
you
what
it
a
good
question
let
look
in
the
catalogue
i
like
to
find
information
in
that
volume
about
something
besides
the
four
centuries
of
study
that
loom
before
my
freshman
eyes
so
they
looked
in
the
catalogue
and
discovered
that
cartwright
college
had
an
endowment
of
producing
an
income
of
about
a
year
and
that
the
churches
of
its
territory
gave
about
more
they
learned
also
that
most
of
the
buildings
had
been
provided
by
friends
of
the
college
with
the
carnegie
library
mainly
the
gift
of
the
millionaire
ironmaster
they
learned
also
that
about
of
the
endowment
had
been
raised
in
the
last
two
years
under
the
promise
of
the
general
education
board
which
is
a
rockefeller
creation
to
provide
the
last
the
college
property
was
valued
at
about
half
a
million
dollars
and
there
you
are
martin
luther
my
bold
reformer
said
cheerfully
the
people
who
put
up
the
money
have
invested
about
two
and
a
half
millions
on
you
and
me
and
the
other
five
hundred
students
say
about
a
year
per
student
and
we
pay
the
rest
of
what
it
costs
to
give
us
a
college
career
to
a
year
depending
on
our
taste
in
courses
i
remember
i
felt
as
if
the
john
wesley
farwell
family
had
almost
gone
broke
when
dad
signed
up
for
on
that
last
endowment
campaign
i
thought
the
money
gone
forever
but
i
see
now
he
merely
invested
it
i
come
to
cartwright
to
spend
the
income
of
it
and
a
little
more
five
or
six
people
have
given
a
thousand
dollars
apiece
to
make
a
college
course
possible
for
each
of
us
there
some
reason
in
college
endowments
after
all
and
marty
said
one
good
i
can
see
in
this
particular
endowment
is
that
anybody
but
a
selfish
idiot
would
be
glad
to
match
four
years
of
his
life
against
all
the
money
and
work
that
christian
people
have
put
into
cartwright
college
i
hope
you
do
mean
anything
personal
by
that
remark
said
with
mock
solemnity
because
i
inclined
to
believe
you
more
than
half
right
it
reminds
me
again
of
what
phil
khamis
said
i
beginning
to
think
i
never
have
a
chance
to
forget
that
greek
christian
remark
about
christians
by
being
off
at
school
together
and
marty
gave
each
other
unconfessed
but
very
real
moral
support
in
those
first
days
when
a
lone
freshman
would
have
known
he
was
homesick
but
another
antidote
both
pleasant
and
potent
was
supplied
by
the
epworth
league
of
first
church
it
had
allied
itself
with
the
college
and
for
the
women
students
with
the
in
various
ways
but
particularly
it
purposed
to
see
that
the
first
few
sundays
were
safely
tided
over
so
the
two
chums
found
themselves
in
one
of
the
two
highly
attractive
study
courses
which
had
been
put
on
in
partnership
with
the
sunday
school
it
was
in
the
early
afternoon
of
one
of
the
early
sundays
that
called
marty
attention
to
a
still
more
alluring
opportunity
looky
here
marty
it
raining
i
know
but
i
a
feeling
that
better
not
write
that
letter
home
until
a
little
further
on
in
the
day
what
to
stop
us
from
taking
a
look
at
this
league
fellowship
hour
we
invited
to
and
getting
a
light
lunch
we
do
need
to
stay
to
the
league
meeting
unless
we
choose
though
we
members
you
know
marty
picked
up
the
card
of
invitation
which
had
flipped
across
the
table
to
him
and
read
it
well
he
commented
it
reads
all
right
let
try
it
out
into
the
rain
they
went
and
put
in
two
highly
cheerful
hours
including
one
in
the
devotional
meeting
so
that
when
marty
at
last
sat
down
to
write
home
he
produced
without
quite
knowing
how
a
letter
that
was
vastly
more
heartening
when
it
reached
the
farm
than
it
would
have
been
if
he
had
written
it
before
dark
joe
carbrook
set
out
for
the
state
university
in
what
was
for
him
a
fashion
quite
subdued
before
his
experience
at
the
institute
he
would
have
gone
if
at
all
in
his
own
car
and
his
arrival
would
have
been
notice
to
the
sporty
crowd
that
another
candidate
for
initiation
into
that
select
circle
had
arrived
but
joe
was
enjoying
the
novelty
of
thinking
a
little
before
he
acted
though
he
would
always
be
of
the
irrepressible
sort
he
was
not
the
same
joe
he
had
laid
out
a
program
which
surprised
himself
somewhat
and
astonished
most
of
the
people
who
knew
him
he
knew
now
that
he
would
become
if
he
could
a
doctor
a
missionary
doctor
no
other
career
entered
his
mind
he
would
finish
his
college
work
at
the
state
university
and
then
go
to
medical
school
he
would
devote
himself
without
ceasing
to
all
the
studies
he
would
need
not
for
him
any
social
life
any
relaxation
of
purpose
grimly
he
told
himself
that
his
play
days
were
over
they
had
been
lively
while
they
lasted
but
they
were
done
of
course
that
was
foolish
if
he
had
persisted
in
any
such
scholastic
regimen
the
effort
would
have
lasted
a
few
days
or
possibly
weeks
and
then
in
a
reaction
of
disgust
he
might
easily
have
come
to
despair
of
the
whole
project
fortunately
for
joe
and
for
a
good
many
other
people
his
purpose
of
digging
into
his
books
and
laboratory
work
and
doggedly
avoiding
any
other
interest
was
tempered
by
the
happenings
of
the
first
week
doubtless
he
would
have
made
a
desperate
struggle
but
it
would
have
been
useless
not
even
conversion
can
make
new
habits
overnight
and
in
his
first
two
years
at
college
joe
had
been
known
to
teachers
and
students
alike
as
distinctly
a
sketchy
student
wholly
inexpert
at
concentrated
effort
and
so
instead
of
becoming
first
a
grind
and
then
a
discouraged
rebel
against
it
all
he
had
the
immense
good
fortune
to
be
captured
by
an
observant
junior
whom
he
had
met
while
they
were
both
registering
for
chemistry
iii
you
new
here
said
the
junior
heatherby
by
name
and
i
had
two
years
of
it
maybe
you
let
me
show
you
the
place
i
the
proud
of
a
decidedly
nanny
you
know
and
i
rather
like
bumping
people
around
town
in
it
that
was
the
beginning
of
many
things
joe
liked
it
that
heatherby
made
no
apologies
for
his
car
and
before
long
he
discovered
that
the
other
barnard
was
equally
unaffected
and
friendly
it
was
something
of
a
surprise
though
to
learn
that
barnard
was
not
a
student
but
the
pastor
of
the
university
methodist
church
of
late
known
as
the
wesley
foundation
i
not
up
on
methodism
as
i
should
be
said
joe
to
barnard
a
day
or
two
later
and
i
may
as
well
admit
that
i
never
heard
before
of
this
wesley
foundation
of
yours
is
it
a
church
affair
well
rather
barnard
answered
it
is
just
exactly
that
you
know
or
could
have
guessed
that
a
good
many
of
the
students
here
are
from
methodist
homes
about
a
fourth
of
the
whole
student
body
as
it
happens
and
our
church
has
been
coming
to
see
perhaps
a
bit
slowly
that
although
the
state
could
not
provide
any
religious
influences
and
could
certainly
do
nothing
for
denominational
interests
there
was
all
the
more
reason
for
the
church
to
do
it
that
the
idea
under
the
foundation
so
to
speak
and
the
work
is
now
established
in
nine
of
the
great
state
universities
yes
i
see
joe
mused
but
just
what
is
the
foundation
duty
and
how
do
you
do
it
barnard
laughed
as
he
said
we
do
pretty
near
everything
in
this
university
we
have
a
regular
methodist
church
with
a
membership
made
up
almost
entirely
of
faculty
and
students
the
town
people
have
their
own
first
church
over
on
the
west
side
our
church
has
its
sunday
school
its
epworth
league
chapter
and
other
activities
we
try
to
come
out
strong
on
the
social
side
and
in
a
little
while
when
our
social
center
building
is
up
we
after
the
money
for
it
now
we
can
do
a
good
deal
more
there
is
plenty
of
demand
for
it
that
all
church
work
of
course
i
suppose
you
have
no
relation
to
the
university
though
joe
asked
studies
and
all
that
yes
indeed
and
we
coming
to
more
of
it
but
gradually
we
are
already
offering
courses
in
religious
subjects
with
teachers
recognized
by
the
university
and
credit
given
it
all
very
new
yet
you
know
but
we
hoping
and
going
ahead
i
should
think
so
said
joe
with
emphasis
but
where
does
the
money
come
from
for
all
this
it
must
be
methodist
money
of
course
who
puts
it
up
oh
the
usual
people
said
barnard
a
few
methodists
have
provided
some
of
it
but
the
really
big
money
has
to
come
from
the
churches
collections
and
subscriptions
and
all
that
this
sort
of
work
is
being
done
in
other
schools
where
the
wesley
foundation
is
not
organized
the
money
comes
officially
through
two
of
the
benevolent
boards
yes
queried
joe
i
often
heard
of
benevolences
but
i
never
thought
of
them
as
meaning
anything
to
me
how
do
they
hook
up
to
a
proposition
like
that
well
said
barnard
the
board
of
education
naturally
is
interested
because
of
the
methodist
students
who
are
here
and
the
board
of
home
missions
and
church
extension
is
interested
because
at
bottom
this
is
the
realest
sort
of
home
mission
and
church
extension
work
do
these
boards
supply
all
the
money
you
need
was
joe
next
question
no
not
all
at
once
anyway
barnard
answered
we
needing
a
good
deal
more
before
this
thing
really
gets
on
its
feet
and
when
our
people
know
what
work
can
be
done
in
state
schools
and
what
a
glorious
chance
we
have
i
think
they
see
that
the
money
is
provided
the
students
are
there
half
a
hundred
thousand
of
them
and
the
church
must
be
there
too
well
joe
said
i
admire
the
faith
of
you
and
i
want
to
join
you
know
although
i
a
mighty
green
hand
at
religious
work
i
got
to
go
at
it
hard
there
a
reason
so
please
count
me
in
on
everything
where
i
likely
to
fit
at
all
i
did
tell
you
did
i
that
i
headed
for
medicine
going
to
be
a
missionary
doctor
if
they
take
me
when
ready
maybe
your
foundation
can
do
something
with
me
barnard
thought
it
could
and
the
next
two
years
justified
his
confidence
joe
carbrook
as
downright
in
his
new
purpose
as
he
had
been
in
his
old
scornful
refusal
to
look
at
life
seriously
quickly
found
a
place
for
himself
in
the
church
and
the
other
activities
of
the
foundation
it
saved
him
from
his
first
heedless
resolution
to
study
an
impossible
number
of
hours
a
day
and
from
the
certain
crash
which
would
have
followed
it
gave
him
not
a
few
friends
and
he
was
soon
deep
in
the
affairs
of
the
league
and
the
church
besides
it
made
possible
some
special
friendships
among
the
faculty
which
were
to
be
of
immense
value
in
later
days
while
joe
carbrook
was
fitting
himself
into
the
life
of
the
university
and
the
wesley
foundation
the
chums
at
cartwright
were
quite
as
busy
making
themselves
a
part
of
their
new
world
as
always
they
made
a
good
team
so
much
so
that
people
began
to
think
of
them
not
as
individuals
but
as
necessarily
related
like
a
pair
of
shoes
or
collar
and
tie
or
pork
and
beans
and
though
the
old
differences
of
temperament
and
interest
had
not
lessened
the
two
had
reached
a
fine
contentment
over
each
other
purposes
was
happy
in
and
marty
believed
implicitly
in
the
wisdom
of
understood
purpose
to
be
a
forthright
christian
layman
but
it
was
not
all
plain
sailing
for
nobody
bothered
marty
he
was
going
into
the
ministry
and
that
settled
that
among
the
students
who
went
in
for
religious
work
were
several
who
could
not
quite
share
marty
complacence
over
program
they
thought
it
strange
that
so
active
a
christian
with
the
right
stuff
in
him
as
everybody
recognized
should
not
declare
himself
for
some
religious
vocation
and
from
time
to
time
men
came
to
college
bishops
secretaries
specialists
to
talk
to
the
students
about
this
very
thing
there
was
a
student
volunteer
band
in
which
were
enrolled
all
the
students
looking
to
foreign
mission
work
the
prospective
preachers
had
a
club
of
their
own
and
there
was
even
a
little
organized
group
of
boys
and
girls
who
thought
seriously
of
social
service
in
some
form
or
another
as
a
career
now
before
the
end
of
sophomore
year
had
come
to
know
all
or
nearly
all
of
these
young
enthusiasts
some
of
them
developed
into
staunch
and
satisfying
friends
if
he
had
run
with
the
sport
crowd
which
was
always
looking
for
recruits
or
if
he
had
been
merely
a
hard
student
working
for
phi
beta
kappa
he
might
have
been
let
alone
but
without
being
able
to
wear
an
identifying
label
he
yet
belonged
with
those
who
had
come
to
college
with
a
definite
life
purpose
just
because
nobody
seemed
to
realize
that
being
a
christian
in
business
could
be
as
distinct
a
vocation
as
any
was
at
times
vaguely
troubled
in
spite
of
his
confident
stand
at
the
institute
he
wondered
a
little
at
what
he
had
almost
come
to
feel
was
his
callousness
not
that
he
was
uninterested
for
marty
he
had
vast
unspoken
ambitions
which
would
have
stunned
that
unsuspecting
youth
if
they
had
ever
become
vocal
and
he
never
tired
of
the
prospects
which
opened
up
before
his
other
friends
he
kept
up
an
intermittent
correspondence
with
joe
carbrook
and
found
himself
thinking
much
about
the
strange
chain
of
circumstances
which
promised
to
make
a
medical
missionary
out
of
joe
he
more
than
suspected
that
joe
and
marcia
dayne
were
vastly
interested
in
each
other
future
and
he
got
a
lot
of
satisfaction
out
of
that
they
would
have
a
great
missionary
career
no
he
was
not
unfeeling
about
all
these
high
purposes
of
the
boys
and
girls
he
knew
and
if
he
could
just
get
a
final
answer
to
the
one
question
that
was
bothering
him
his
college
life
would
need
nothing
to
make
it
wholly
satisfying
he
had
early
forgotten
all
his
old
reluctance
to
put
college
before
business
marty
knew
something
of
what
was
passing
in
mind
and
it
troubled
him
a
little
he
thought
of
tackling
himself
and
by
this
time
there
was
nothing
under
the
sun
they
could
not
discuss
with
each
other
freely
but
he
did
not
quite
trust
himself
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
write
to
their
pastor
at
home
he
knew
that
for
some
reason
drury
had
a
peculiar
interest
in
and
was
sure
he
could
count
on
it
now
i
know
bothered
he
wrote
but
he
does
talk
about
it
i
think
he
has
been
disturbed
by
hearing
so
much
about
special
calls
to
special
work
we
had
several
lifework
meetings
lately
and
the
needs
of
the
world
have
been
pretty
strongly
stated
but
the
stand
he
took
at
the
institute
is
just
as
right
for
him
as
mine
is
for
me
ca
you
write
to
him
or
something
walter
drury
could
do
better
than
write
he
turned
up
at
cartwright
that
same
week
it
happened
that
three
or
four
prospective
preachers
and
christian
workers
had
been
in
their
room
that
afternoon
and
was
trying
to
think
the
thing
through
once
more
he
recalled
what
his
pastor
had
said
at
the
camp
fire
and
his
own
testimony
on
institute
sunday
in
the
meeting
after
marcia
dayne
had
put
it
up
to
him
but
he
was
making
heavy
weather
of
it
and
just
then
came
the
pastor
knock
at
the
door
there
was
a
boisterous
welcome
from
them
both
with
something
like
relief
in
heart
that
he
would
not
could
not
speak
but
he
could
get
help
now
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
he
asked
the
usual
question
what
in
the
world
brings
you
to
cartwright
oh
said
pastor
drury
i
like
to
come
to
cartwright
your
an
old
friend
besides
why
should
i
come
to
see
you
two
if
i
wish
you
are
still
part
of
my
flock
you
know
so
they
talked
of
anything
and
everything
by
and
by
marty
said
he
must
go
over
to
the
library
and
pretty
soon
was
telling
his
friend
the
pastor
all
that
had
been
disturbing
him
it
all
began
in
the
summer
before
i
came
to
college
at
the
institute
here
you
know
when
you
spoke
at
the
camp
fire
on
saturday
night
i
remember
the
pastor
replied
you
had
taken
much
interest
in
your
future
work
before
that
no
real
interest
i
guess
admitted
i
always
taken
things
as
they
came
and
did
go
looking
for
what
i
could
see
i
was
enjoying
every
day
living
and
did
care
deeply
about
anything
else
why
though
i
been
a
methodist
all
my
life
you
remember
how
i
knew
nothing
at
all
about
the
methodist
church
outside
of
delafield
except
what
little
i
picked
up
about
its
sunday
schools
by
serving
as
an
assistant
to
our
sunday
school
secretary
and
when
i
began
to
hear
at
the
institute
about
home
missions
and
foreign
missions
about
negro
education
and
other
business
that
the
church
was
doing
i
saw
right
off
that
it
was
up
to
us
young
people
to
supply
the
new
workers
that
were
always
needed
but
even
so
only
those
who
had
a
real
fitness
for
it
ought
to
offer
themselves
and
i
thought
too
that
something
else
would
be
needed
i
was
any
duller
than
lots
of
other
church
members
even
the
older
ones
did
seem
to
know
much
more
about
the
church
outside
than
i
did
you
would
take
up
collections
for
the
benevolences
but
if
you
told
us
what
they
meant
we
did
pay
enough
attention
to
get
the
idea
clearly
so
as
to
have
any
real
understanding
i
suppose
the
women
societies
had
more
i
know
my
mother
talks
about
industrial
homes
in
the
south
and
schools
in
india
she
in
both
the
societies
you
know
but
that
is
about
all
and
it
seemed
when
i
began
to
find
out
about
things
drury
that
if
our
whole
church
needed
workers
for
all
these
places
it
needed
just
as
much
to
have
in
the
local
churches
men
and
women
who
would
know
about
the
work
in
a
big
way
and
who
would
care
in
a
big
way
to
back
up
the
whole
work
as
it
should
be
backed
up
so
when
you
spoke
at
the
camp
fire
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
to
hear
and
when
i
was
called
on
i
made
that
sort
of
a
declaration
the
next
day
at
the
life
decision
services
yes
i
remember
that
too
said
drury
and
i
remember
telling
joe
carbrook
that
you
had
undertaken
as
big
a
career
as
any
of
them
that
what
i
kind
of
thought
too
said
simply
but
rooming
with
marty
shenk
he
going
to
make
a
great
preacher
too
keeps
me
thinking
and
i
know
about
all
the
students
who
are
getting
ready
for
special
work
and
lately
i
been
wondering
about
some
special
sort
of
work
you
like
to
do
drury
prompted
no
not
that
at
all
i
just
as
sure
as
ever
i
not
that
sort
if
only
i
can
make
good
in
business
there
where
i
belong
but
can
a
fellow
make
good
just
as
a
christian
in
the
same
way
i
expect
marty
shenk
to
make
good
as
a
christian
preacher
the
pastor
stood
up
and
came
over
to
chair
my
boy
i
know
just
what
you
are
facing
it
is
a
pretty
old
struggle
and
there
only
one
way
out
of
it
god
has
any
first
place
and
second
place
for
the
people
that
let
him
guide
them
a
man
may
refuse
his
call
either
to
go
or
to
stay
and
then
no
matter
what
he
does
it
will
be
a
second
best
but
you
wait
for
your
call
for
my
part
i
think
probably
you
got
it
and
it
to
a
very
real
life
if
you
and
those
like
you
should
fail
we
should
soon
have
no
more
missionaries
and
if
the
missionaries
should
fail
we
should
soon
have
no
more
church
god
has
little
patience
with
a
church
that
always
stays
at
home
and
i
doubt
if
he
has
more
for
a
church
that
does
stand
by
the
men
and
women
it
has
sent
to
the
outposts
it
is
all
one
job
there
was
much
more
of
the
same
sort
and
when
walked
with
his
pastor
to
the
train
the
next
morning
the
only
doubt
that
had
ever
really
disturbed
him
in
college
was
quieted
for
good
walter
drury
went
back
to
delafield
and
his
work
surer
now
than
ever
that
the
experiment
was
going
forward
he
knew
certainly
that
all
this
was
only
the
getting
ready
that
the
real
tests
would
come
later
but
he
was
well
content
it
was
early
football
season
of
the
junior
year
the
state
university
took
on
cartwright
college
for
the
first
saturday
game
everybody
well
knowing
that
it
was
only
a
practice
romp
for
the
university
always
a
big
time
for
cartwright
this
year
it
was
a
day
for
remembering
joe
carbrook
who
had
been
graduated
from
the
university
in
june
and
was
now
a
medical
student
in
the
city
drove
down
to
see
the
game
for
loyalty
sake
he
joined
the
little
bunch
of
university
rooters
on
the
east
stand
otherwise
it
was
cartwright
crowd
as
well
as
day
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
neither
side
scored
until
the
last
quarter
and
then
both
sides
made
a
touchdown
cartwright
first
a
high
tricky
wind
spoiled
both
attempts
to
kick
goal
and
time
was
called
with
a
score
at
cartwright
had
held
state
to
a
tie
for
the
first
time
in
history
joe
came
from
the
game
with
the
chums
and
took
supper
with
them
the
whole
town
was
ablaze
with
excitement
over
its
team
great
showing
against
the
state
and
the
talk
at
table
was
all
of
the
way
eleven
could
now
go
romping
down
the
schedule
and
take
every
other
college
into
camp
including
of
course
barton
poly
their
dearest
foe
the
boys
were
happy
to
have
joe
with
them
he
looked
so
big
and
fine
and
had
the
same
easy
breezy
bearing
as
of
old
nor
had
he
lost
any
of
that
frank
attitude
toward
his
own
career
which
never
failed
to
interest
everybody
he
met
after
supper
they
had
an
hour
together
in
the
room
those
boys
in
the
medical
school
surely
do
amuse
me
he
laughed
when
i
tell
i
to
be
a
missionary
doctor
which
i
do
first
thing
to
give
sort
of
a
shock
they
do
often
get
they
stand
off
and
say
you
as
if
i
had
told
i
was
to
be
a
traffic
cop
or
a
trapeze
artist
in
the
circus
some
of
seem
to
think
i
queer
in
the
head
but
boys
they
are
the
ones
with
rooms
to
let
when
the
others
talk
about
hanging
out
a
shingle
in
chicago
or
saint
louis
or
cleveland
or
some
other
place
i
tell
to
watch
me
when
i
the
only
doctor
between
siam
and
sunrise
wo
i
be
somebody
with
my
own
hospital
made
out
o
mud
i
know
and
a
dispensary
and
a
few
native
helpers
who
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
next
and
all
the
sick
people
coming
from
ten
days
journey
away
to
the
foreign
doctor
and
then
his
mood
changed
that
what
get
me
though
all
those
helpless
ignorant
humans
who
do
even
know
what
i
can
do
for
their
bodies
let
alone
having
any
suspicion
of
what
somebody
else
can
do
for
their
souls
but
it
will
be
wonderful
next
thing
to
being
with
him
in
galilee
there
was
a
pause
each
boy
filling
it
with
thoughts
he
would
not
speak
where
do
you
expect
to
find
that
work
joe
asked
him
the
answer
was
quick
and
straight
wherever
i
sent
boy
he
said
only
i
told
the
candidate
secretary
what
i
want
i
met
him
last
summer
in
chicago
and
there
nothing
like
getting
in
your
bid
early
he
agreed
to
recommend
me
when
i
ready
for
the
hardest
neediest
most
neglected
place
that
open
if
i
going
into
this
missionary
doctor
business
i
want
a
chance
to
prove
christianity
where
they
wo
be
able
to
say
that
christianity
could
have
done
it
alone
it
then
with
one
of
those
quick
turns
which
were
joe
carbrook
devices
for
concealing
his
feelings
he
said
and
how
everything
going
at
this
methodist
college
of
yours
your
boys
put
up
a
beautiful
game
and
they
ought
to
have
won
how
the
rest
of
the
school
both
the
boys
assured
him
everything
was
going
in
a
properly
satisfactory
fashion
but
marty
had
caught
one
word
that
he
wanted
joe
to
enlarge
upon
why
do
you
say
college
it
is
a
methodist
college
but
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
that
joe
rose
to
the
mild
challenge
do
think
i
mean
to
be
nasty
he
said
but
i
ca
help
comparing
this
place
with
the
state
university
and
i
wonder
if
there
any
big
reason
for
such
colleges
as
this
you
know
they
all
have
a
hard
time
and
the
state
spends
dollars
to
the
church
dimes
yes
we
know
that
do
we
and
marty
appealed
to
his
chum
remembering
the
frequent
and
talks
they
had
on
that
very
contrast
said
sure
but
plainly
meant
to
leave
the
defense
of
the
christian
college
to
marty
who
to
tell
the
truth
was
quite
willing
there
room
for
both
and
need
for
both
said
that
earnest
young
man
each
has
its
work
to
do
the
state
university
will
probably
help
in
attracting
most
of
those
who
want
special
technical
equipment
and
the
church
colleges
will
keep
on
serving
those
who
want
an
education
for
its
own
sake
whatever
special
line
they
may
take
up
afterward
though
each
will
say
it
welcomes
both
sorts
of
students
this
suited
joe
he
intended
marty
to
keep
it
up
a
while
so
he
said
but
why
is
a
church
college
anyway
and
he
got
his
answer
for
marty
too
was
eager
for
the
fray
the
church
college
he
retorted
with
the
merest
hint
of
asperity
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
that
people
call
higher
education
the
church
was
founding
colleges
and
supporting
them
before
the
state
thought
even
of
primary
schools
look
at
oxford
and
cambridge
church
colleges
look
at
harvard
and
yale
and
princeton
and
the
smaller
new
england
colleges
church
colleges
look
at
syracuse
and
wesleyan
and
northwestern
and
chicago
look
at
vanderbilt
and
most
of
the
other
great
schools
of
the
south
they
are
church
colleges
founded
most
of
them
before
the
first
state
university
and
many
before
there
was
any
public
high
school
the
church
college
showed
the
way
if
it
had
never
done
anything
else
it
has
some
rights
as
the
pioneer
of
higher
learning
had
been
getting
more
interested
he
had
never
heard
marty
in
quite
this
strain
and
he
was
proud
of
him
that
a
pretty
good
answer
he
given
you
joe
he
said
with
a
chuckle
now
is
it
it
is
admitted
joe
i
reckon
i
knew
most
of
what
you
say
marty
but
i
had
thought
of
it
that
way
before
now
i
want
to
ask
another
question
only
do
think
i
doing
it
for
meanness
i
got
a
reason
and
my
question
is
this
granting
all
that
the
church
schools
have
done
is
it
worth
all
they
cost
to
keep
them
up
now
in
our
time
i
mean
i
think
it
is
marty
answered
quieter
now
they
do
provide
a
different
sort
of
educational
opportunity
as
i
said
then
they
are
producing
most
of
the
recruits
that
the
churches
need
for
their
work
since
the
churches
began
to
care
for
their
members
in
the
state
universities
a
rather
larger
number
of
candidates
for
christian
service
are
coming
out
of
the
universities
but
until
the
last
year
or
two
nearly
all
came
and
the
very
large
majority
still
comes
and
probably
for
years
will
come
from
the
church
colleges
and
there
another
reason
that
you
state
advocates
ought
to
remember
our
methodist
colleges
in
this
country
have
about
fifty
thousand
students
if
these
colleges
were
to
be
put
out
of
business
ten
of
the
very
greatest
state
universities
would
have
to
be
duplicated
dollar
for
dollar
at
public
expense
to
take
care
of
the
methodist
students
alone
when
you
think
of
all
the
other
denominations
you
would
need
to
duplicate
all
the
state
universities
now
in
existence
if
you
purposed
to
do
the
work
the
church
colleges
are
now
doing
and
if
you
could
get
the
money
or
if
the
students
did
take
to
the
change
the
country
would
be
short
just
that
many
thousand
men
and
women
the
whole
methodist
church
with
the
other
churches
is
doing
a
piece
of
unselfish
national
service
that
costs
up
into
the
hundreds
of
millions
and
where
any
other
big
money
that
better
spent
when
marty
stopped
he
looked
up
into
joe
face
and
blushed
with
an
embarrassed
you
think
you
been
stringing
me
do
you
now
marty
joe
spoke
genially
do
you
misunderstand
i
said
i
had
a
reason
i
have
my
folks
have
some
money
they
want
to
put
into
a
safe
place
and
they
like
cartwright
i
do
too
but
you
know
how
it
is
i
want
to
be
sure
anyhow
i
glad
i
asked
these
questions
you
given
me
some
highly
important
information
and
honestly
i
grateful
you
surely
do
think
i
small
enough
to
be
making
fun
of
you
or
of
cartwright
if
i
seemed
to
be
i
apologize
on
the
spot
believe
me
and
there
was
no
mistaking
his
genuine
earnestness
of
course
i
believe
you
old
man
marty
rejoined
just
a
wee
bit
ashamed
forgive
me
too
but
i
been
reading
up
on
that
college
thing
lately
and
it
a
little
different
from
what
most
people
think
so
you
got
me
going
i
glad
he
did
said
it
makes
me
prouder
than
ever
of
cartwright
college
and
as
he
got
up
he
said
as
though
still
at
the
game
the
now
and
gave
cartwright
favorite
yell
as
a
solo
while
marty
and
joe
grinned
approval
and
some
students
passing
in
the
street
answered
it
with
the
skyrocket
there
is
material
for
a
book
all
mixt
of
interest
varying
from
very
light
comedy
to
unplumbed
gloom
in
the
life
of
two
boys
at
college
any
two
and
some
day
the
chronicles
of
the
delafield
duo
may
be
written
but
not
now
senior
year
with
its
bright
glory
and
its
seriously
borne
responsibilities
it
found
marty
a
trifle
less
shy
and
reticent
than
when
he
came
to
cartwright
and
a
shade
more
studious
marty
would
miss
phi
beta
kappa
but
only
by
the
merest
fraction
would
rank
about
number
in
a
graduating
class
of
marty
had
successfully
represented
his
college
twice
in
debate
and
had
played
second
on
the
nine
and
end
in
the
eleven
doing
each
job
better
than
well
but
rarely
drawing
the
spotlight
his
way
curiously
enough
you
had
but
to
talk
to
marty
and
you
would
learn
that
was
the
finest
athlete
and
the
most
popular
student
in
school
conversely
was
prepared
to
set
cartwright
debating
record
as
incarnated
in
marty
against
that
of
any
other
college
in
the
state
what
was
more
he
cherished
an
unshakable
confidence
that
the
rev
martin
luther
shenk
would
be
one
of
the
leading
ministers
of
his
conference
within
five
years
and
so
they
came
to
commencement
with
the
shenk
and
the
farwell
families
pastor
drury
and
marcia
dayne
in
the
throng
of
visitors
drury
rarely
missed
commencements
at
cartwright
and
naturally
he
could
not
stay
away
this
year
the
farwells
thought
marcia
might
like
to
see
her
old
schoolmates
graduate
and
the
boys
had
written
her
that
they
wanted
somebody
they
could
trot
around
during
commencement
week
who
might
be
trusted
to
join
in
the
i
knew
him
when
chorus
without
being
tempted
to
introduce
devastating
reminiscences
and
marcia
being
in
love
with
life
and
youth
had
been
delighted
to
accept
the
combined
invitation
she
was
not
at
all
in
love
with
either
of
the
boys
nor
they
with
her
they
thought
they
knew
where
her
heart
had
been
given
and
they
counted
joe
carbrook
a
lucky
man
tell
us
marcia
said
one
afternoon
as
the
three
of
them
were
down
by
the
lake
how
it
happens
you
went
to
the
training
school
instead
of
the
normal
school
last
year
that
just
like
a
man
said
marcia
here
am
i
your
awed
and
admiring
slave
brought
on
to
adorn
the
crowning
event
of
your
scholastic
career
and
you
do
even
remember
that
i
finished
the
normal
school
course
in
three
years
and
graduated
a
year
ago
marty
rolled
over
on
the
sand
in
wordless
glee
aw
now
marcia
why
boggled
fairly
caught
but
soon
recovering
himself
you
must
have
been
ashamed
of
it
then
i
do
remember
something
about
your
getting
through
now
you
mention
the
fact
but
why
did
i
receive
an
invitation
answer
me
that
young
lady
oh
we
educators
do
think
commencement
amounts
to
so
much
as
all
that
with
us
you
know
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
so
forth
but
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
knew
you
could
come
either
of
you
and
i
was
saving
up
a
little
on
commencement
expenses
so
i
left
you
and
a
good
many
others
off
the
list
i
needed
the
money
the
simple
fact
and
the
reason
you
did
see
me
at
home
last
summer
was
because
i
was
busy
spending
the
money
i
had
saved
on
your
invitations
and
other
expensive
things
marty
usually
waited
for
but
the
idea
which
now
occurred
to
him
demanded
utterance
say
marcia
i
think
it
fine
of
you
to
be
studying
dispensary
work
and
first
aid
how
did
you
know
marcia
demanded
never
mind
i
saw
joe
carbrook
in
chicago
when
we
went
through
on
our
way
to
the
debate
and
i
guessed
a
good
deal
more
than
he
told
me
which
was
much
marty
said
marcia
her
face
aglow
and
her
brave
eyes
looking
into
his
there
nothing
secret
about
it
when
joe
gets
through
medical
school
we
shall
go
out
together
to
whatever
field
they
choose
for
him
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
get
ready
to
help
is
that
why
you
been
going
to
training
school
asked
they
had
so
long
been
used
to
such
complete
frankness
with
each
other
that
the
question
was
taken
as
meant
yes
it
is
said
marcia
joe
has
been
doing
perfectly
splendid
work
in
his
medical
course
and
they
say
he
will
probably
turn
out
to
be
a
wonderful
doctor
everybody
is
surprised
at
his
thoroughness
except
me
i
know
what
he
means
by
it
but
of
course
he
has
little
time
for
training
in
other
sorts
of
religious
work
and
so
ever
since
last
june
i
been
dividing
my
time
between
a
settlement
dispensary
and
the
training
school
why
should
i
be
as
keen
on
my
preparation
as
he
is
on
his
when
we
going
out
to
the
same
work
you
should
marcia
you
should
agreed
vigorously
and
proud
of
you
are
we
marty
i
remember
thinking
two
years
ago
what
fine
missionary
pioneers
you
two
would
make
only
trouble
is
never
know
anything
about
it
after
we
once
seen
your
pictures
in
epworth
among
the
recruits
of
the
year
if
you
were
only
going
where
a
feller
could
hope
to
visit
you
once
every
two
years
or
so
marcia
looked
out
across
the
lake
but
she
was
seeing
the
white
sails
that
glided
along
above
the
rippling
blue
of
its
waters
in
a
moment
she
pulled
herself
together
and
observed
that
there
had
been
enough
talk
about
a
mere
visitor
what
of
you
two
now
that
your
student
occupation
gone
tell
her
about
yourself
marty
said
she
knows
what
i
going
to
do
and
for
the
moment
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
drab
and
unromantic
prospect
in
spite
of
his
agreement
with
drury
that
all
service
ranks
alike
with
god
marty
was
always
slow
to
talk
of
himself
it
is
much
he
said
the
district
superintendent
is
asking
me
to
fill
out
the
year
on
the
ellis
and
valencia
circuit
the
present
pastor
is
going
to
colorado
for
his
health
so
i
to
be
the
young
and
he
smiled
a
wry
little
smile
he
had
no
conceit
of
himself
to
make
the
appointment
seem
poor
rather
he
wondered
how
any
circuit
would
consent
to
put
up
with
a
boy
crude
preaching
and
awkward
pastoral
effort
but
was
otherwise
minded
a
country
circuit
for
marty
did
not
accord
with
his
views
at
all
marty
was
too
good
for
a
country
church
he
argued
mainly
from
his
memories
of
the
bare
little
meetinghouse
of
his
early
childhood
in
his
periodical
trips
to
the
farm
he
had
seen
the
old
church
grow
older
and
more
forlorn
as
one
family
after
another
moved
away
and
the
multiplying
cars
brought
the
town
and
its
allurements
almost
to
the
front
gate
of
every
farm
so
had
tried
to
say
no
for
marty
who
would
not
say
it
for
himself
it
was
one
of
the
rare
times
when
they
did
not
see
eye
to
eye
but
it
made
no
difference
in
their
sturdy
affection
nothing
ever
could
and
marty
would
take
the
appointment
commencement
over
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
the
chums
went
their
separate
ways
marty
to
his
circuit
and
home
to
delafield
then
for
a
little
while
each
had
frequent
days
without
quite
realizing
what
made
his
world
so
flavorless
but
that
passed
and
the
young
preacher
settled
down
to
his
preaching
and
the
young
merchant
to
his
merchandising
and
soon
all
things
seemed
as
if
they
had
been
just
so
through
the
years
to
came
just
one
indication
of
the
change
that
college
had
made
pastor
drury
though
he
found
it
wise
to
do
much
of
his
important
work
in
secret
thought
to
make
use
of
the
which
most
towns
possess
in
june
and
which
is
felt
especially
though
not
confessed
by
the
college
colony
the
year
diplomas
are
still
very
new
in
june
so
a
college
night
was
announced
for
the
social
rooms
with
a
college
sermon
to
follow
on
the
next
sunday
night
the
league
and
the
senior
sunday
school
department
united
to
send
a
personal
invitation
to
every
college
graduate
in
town
and
to
every
student
home
for
the
vacation
they
responded
four
score
of
them
to
the
call
as
moved
about
and
greeted
people
he
had
known
for
years
he
began
to
realize
that
college
has
its
own
freemasonry
these
other
graduates
were
from
all
sorts
of
schools
two
had
been
to
harvard
and
one
to
princeton
several
were
state
university
alumni
cartwright
was
represented
by
nine
six
of
them
undergraduates
and
the
others
confessed
themselves
as
being
from
chicago
syracuse
de
pauw
three
or
four
sorts
of
wesleyan
northwestern
knox
wabash
western
reserve
and
many
more
not
even
all
methodist
by
any
means
perceived
and
yet
the
fellowship
among
these
strangers
was
very
real
they
spoke
each
tongue
they
had
common
interests
and
common
experiences
he
told
himself
that
here
was
a
suggestion
as
to
the
new
friends
he
might
make
in
delafield
without
forgetting
the
old
ones
and
the
prospect
of
life
in
delafield
began
to
take
on
new
values
on
the
next
sunday
night
not
so
many
college
people
were
out
to
hear
drury
and
sermon
on
what
our
town
asks
of
its
youth
and
a
few
of
those
who
came
were
inclined
to
resent
what
they
called
a
lecture
on
manners
and
duty
but
to
the
sermon
was
precisely
the
challenge
to
service
he
had
been
looking
for
it
made
up
for
his
feeling
at
commencement
that
he
was
out
of
it
it
completed
all
which
drury
had
suggested
at
the
institute
camp
fire
four
years
ago
all
that
he
himself
had
tried
to
say
at
the
decision
service
on
the
day
after
the
camp
fire
all
that
the
pastor
had
urged
two
years
ago
when
confessed
to
him
his
new
hesitations
and
uneasiness
the
pastor
had
not
preached
any
great
thing
he
had
simply
told
the
college
folk
in
his
audience
that
no
matter
where
they
had
gone
to
school
many
people
had
invested
much
in
them
and
that
the
investment
was
one
which
in
its
very
nature
could
not
be
realized
on
by
the
original
investors
the
only
possible
beneficiaries
were
either
the
successive
college
generations
or
the
communities
in
which
they
found
their
place
if
they
chose
to
take
as
personal
and
unconditional
all
the
benefits
of
their
education
none
could
forbid
them
that
choice
but
if
they
accepted
education
as
a
trust
a
stewardship
something
to
be
used
for
the
common
good
they
would
be
worth
more
to
delafield
than
all
the
new
factories
the
chamber
of
commerce
could
coax
to
the
town
and
to
those
who
might
be
interested
in
this
view
of
education
pastor
drury
said
young
people
of
the
colleges
you
have
been
trained
to
some
forms
of
laboratory
work
in
chemistry
in
biology
in
geology
yes
even
in
english
i
invite
you
to
think
of
your
own
town
of
delafield
as
your
living
laboratory
in
which
you
will
be
at
once
experimenters
and
part
of
the
experiment
stuff
look
at
this
town
with
all
its
good
and
evil
its
dying
powers
and
its
new
forces
its
dullnesses
and
its
enthusiasms
its
folly
and
wisdom
its
old
ways
and
its
new
people
its
wealth
and
want
do
you
think
it
is
already
becoming
a
bit
of
the
kingdom
of
god
or
if
you
conclude
that
it
seems
to
be
going
in
ways
that
lead
very
far
from
the
kingdom
do
you
think
it
might
possess
any
kingdom
possibilities
if
you
do
no
matter
what
your
occupation
in
delafield
delafield
itself
may
be
your
true
vocation
your
call
from
god
for
john
wesley
farwell
it
was
to
become
all
of
that
chapter
iv
exploring
main
street
found
small
opportunity
to
make
himself
obnoxious
by
becoming
a
civic
missionary
before
the
time
he
was
busy
enough
with
his
adjustment
to
the
business
life
of
delafield
and
madison
county
this
being
the
declared
commercial
sphere
of
the
john
farwell
hardware
company
always
had
known
hardware
but
hitherto
in
a
purely
amateur
and
detached
fashion
now
he
lived
with
it
from
tacks
to
tractors
ten
or
twelve
hours
a
day
he
found
that
being
the
son
of
his
father
gained
him
no
safe
conduct
through
the
shop
or
with
the
customers
he
had
a
lot
to
learn
even
if
he
was
john
wesley
farwell
that
he
was
the
heir
apparent
to
all
this
array
of
cast
iron
and
wrought
and
galvanized
of
tin
and
wire
and
steel
and
aluminum
and
nickel
did
not
save
him
from
aching
back
and
skinned
knuckles
nor
from
the
various
initiations
staged
by
the
three
or
four
other
employees
but
he
was
getting
his
bearings
and
not
from
the
store
and
the
warehouse
only
a
good
hardware
store
in
a
country
town
is
a
center
of
democracy
for
town
and
country
alike
in
what
other
place
do
farmers
and
artisans
country
women
and
city
women
meet
on
so
nearly
equal
terms
not
in
the
postoffice
nor
in
the
bank
and
certainly
not
in
the
department
store
but
the
hardware
store
customers
men
and
women
all
are
masters
of
the
tools
they
work
with
and
whoso
loves
the
tools
of
his
craft
is
brother
to
every
other
craftsman
it
was
in
the
store
therefore
that
began
to
absorb
some
of
the
knowledge
and
acquire
some
of
the
experiences
that
were
to
make
his
work
something
to
his
town
for
one
thing
he
got
a
new
view
of
local
geography
in
terms
of
tools
all
the
farmers
from
the
bottoms
of
mill
creek
called
for
pretty
much
the
same
implements
the
upland
farms
had
different
needs
the
wives
who
lived
along
the
route
of
the
creamery
wagon
had
one
sort
of
troubles
with
tinware
the
women
of
the
fruit
farms
another
knew
this
by
the
exchange
of
experiences
he
listened
to
while
he
sold
milk
strainers
and
canning
outfits
he
found
out
that
the
people
on
the
edge
of
town
who
made
garden
were
particular
about
certain
tools
and
equipment
which
the
wheat
farmer
would
not
even
look
at
and
the
townpeople
he
learned
to
classify
in
the
same
way
he
was
soon
on
good
terms
with
those
store
clerks
who
were
handy
men
about
the
house
with
women
who
did
all
their
own
work
with
blacksmiths
and
carpenters
with
unskilled
laborers
and
garage
mechanics
in
time
he
could
almost
tell
where
a
man
lived
and
what
he
did
for
a
living
just
by
the
hardware
he
bought
and
the
questions
he
asked
about
it
heretofore
had
thought
he
knew
most
of
the
people
in
delafield
but
the
first
weeks
in
the
store
showed
him
that
he
knew
only
a
few
up
to
this
time
most
of
the
people
in
delafield
had
meant
practically
his
school
friends
the
clerks
and
salespeople
in
certain
stores
and
the
members
of
the
first
methodist
church
that
is
to
say
in
the
main
to
him
delafield
had
been
the
church
and
the
church
had
been
delafield
but
now
he
realized
that
his
church
was
only
a
small
part
of
delafield
the
town
had
other
churches
it
had
lodges
when
the
store
outfitted
odd
fellows
hall
with
new
window
shades
he
learned
that
the
odd
fellows
shared
the
place
with
strong
lodges
of
the
maccabees
and
modern
woodmen
and
there
were
other
halls
farwell
was
a
mason
but
these
other
lodges
seemed
to
have
as
many
members
as
the
masons
and
one
or
the
other
of
them
was
always
getting
ready
for
a
big
public
display
the
same
condition
was
true
of
the
country
people
he
began
to
hear
about
the
farm
federation
and
the
grange
and
the
farmers
elevator
and
the
cooperative
creamery
for
members
of
all
of
these
groups
passed
in
and
out
of
the
store
one
day
remarked
to
the
pastor
who
had
dropped
into
the
store
drury
i
never
noticed
before
how
this
place
is
alive
with
societies
and
clubs
and
lodges
and
things
everybody
seems
to
belong
to
three
or
four
organizations
and
they
talk
about
but
i
do
hear
much
about
our
church
and
nothing
at
all
about
the
old
church
out
at
deep
creek
yet
i
used
to
think
that
the
church
was
the
whole
thing
the
older
man
nodded
it
true
he
said
all
the
churches
together
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
community
they
are
the
best
and
usually
the
forces
we
have
i
sure
of
that
but
the
church
and
the
town
have
to
reckon
with
these
others
what
good
are
they
all
they
must
cost
a
pile
of
money
what
for
that
what
you
might
call
a
whale
of
a
question
john
farwell
senior
who
had
been
standing
by
listening
essayed
to
answer
and
you
have
heard
yet
of
all
the
organizations
look
at
me
for
example
i
belong
to
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
rotary
club
i
on
the
executive
committee
of
the
madison
county
horticultural
society
and
i
just
retired
from
the
board
of
directors
of
the
civic
league
then
you
must
think
of
the
political
parties
and
the
county
sunday
school
association
and
the
annual
chautauqua
and
i
do
know
what
all
yes
and
i
notice
dad
that
a
good
many
of
these
said
are
just
for
the
men
the
women
must
have
nearly
as
many
why
delafield
ought
to
be
a
model
town
and
the
country
here
ought
to
be
a
regular
paradise
with
all
these
helpers
and
uplifters
on
the
job
but
it
is
maybe
they
not
all
on
the
job
that
about
it
my
boy
his
father
agreed
i
sometimes
think
we
need
just
one
more
organization
a
society
that
would
never
meet
but
between
the
meetings
of
all
the
other
societies
would
actually
get
done
the
things
they
talk
about
and
pass
resolutions
about
and
then
go
off
and
forget
until
the
next
meeting
well
dad
what
i
want
to
find
out
said
as
he
started
off
with
drury
to
the
post
office
is
where
the
church
heads
in
drury
is
sure
it
has
a
big
responsibility
and
maybe
it
has
but
what
is
it
willing
to
do
and
able
to
do
and
what
will
the
town
let
it
do
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
question
heard
his
father
voice
echoing
after
him
up
the
street
sure
that
is
the
question
and
drury
added
three
questions
in
one
found
himself
taking
notice
in
a
way
he
had
not
done
before
through
all
his
years
in
delafield
as
might
be
expected
he
had
come
home
from
college
with
new
ideas
and
new
standards
the
town
looked
rather
more
sordid
and
commonplace
than
was
his
boy
remembrance
of
it
of
late
it
had
taken
to
growing
and
a
large
part
of
its
development
had
come
during
his
college
years
so
he
must
needs
learn
his
own
town
all
over
again
cherishing
his
young
college
graduate
vague
new
enthusiasm
for
a
better
world
he
had
little
sympathy
with
much
that
delafield
opinion
acclaimed
as
progress
the
delafield
daily
dispatch
carried
at
its
masthead
every
afternoon
one
or
more
of
such
slogans
as
these
be
a
delafield
booster
boost
for
more
industries
put
delafield
on
the
map
double
delafield
in
half
a
decade
delafield
the
darling
of
destiny
watch
delafield
grow
but
do
stop
boosting
to
rubber
these
were
taken
by
many
citizens
as
a
sort
of
business
gospel
any
theorist
who
ventured
to
question
the
wisdom
of
bringing
more
people
to
town
whether
the
town
business
could
give
them
all
a
decent
living
or
not
was
told
to
sell
his
hammer
and
buy
a
horn
said
nothing
he
was
too
young
and
too
recent
a
comer
into
the
town
business
life
but
he
could
not
work
up
any
zeal
for
this
form
of
town
loyalty
a
big
cannery
had
been
built
down
near
the
river
where
truck
gardens
flourished
and
there
was
a
new
furniture
factory
at
the
edge
of
the
freight
yards
hereabouts
a
lot
of
supremely
ugly
flats
had
gone
up
two
families
to
each
floor
and
three
stories
high
and
in
eyes
the
rubbish
and
disorder
and
generally
slattern
appearance
of
the
region
was
no
great
addition
to
delafield
attractions
still
more
did
the
tumbledown
shacks
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
cannery
offend
the
eyes
and
to
be
frank
the
ears
and
nose
as
well
it
was
a
lot
of
hovels
occupied
by
listless
frowsy
adults
and
noisy
children
here
existence
seemed
to
be
a
grim
caricature
of
life
the
children
the
only
symbol
of
abundance
to
be
seen
continued
to
be
grotesque
in
their
very
dirt
what
clothes
they
had
were
second
or
garments
too
large
for
them
which
they
seemed
to
be
perpetually
in
danger
of
losing
altogether
to
delafield
had
always
been
a
town
of
homes
but
in
these
dismal
quarters
there
was
little
to
answer
to
the
home
idea
they
were
merely
places
where
people
contrived
to
camp
for
a
time
longer
or
shorter
none
but
a
gradgrind
could
call
them
homes
one
of
the
factory
foremen
was
a
great
admirer
of
drury
who
introduced
him
to
one
day
when
the
foreman
had
come
to
the
store
for
some
tools
he
had
talked
with
and
in
time
a
rather
casual
friendliness
developed
between
them
it
was
this
same
foreman
angus
macpherson
a
scot
with
a
name
for
shrewdness
who
gave
the
boy
his
first
glimpse
of
what
the
factory
and
the
cannery
meant
to
delafield
especially
the
factory
was
down
at
the
factory
to
see
about
some
new
that
had
been
installed
and
his
errand
finished
he
stopped
for
a
chat
with
angus
this
factory
was
here
when
i
went
off
to
college
he
said
what
ever
brought
it
to
delafield
at
that
macpherson
was
off
to
a
perfect
start
ye
see
my
boy
he
began
delafield
is
so
central
it
is
a
good
town
for
a
plant
freights
on
lumber
and
finished
stuff
are
not
so
high
as
in
some
places
and
then
there
labor
lots
of
husky
fellows
around
here
want
better
than
farm
wages
and
they
want
a
chance
at
town
life
as
well
men
from
the
big
cities
with
families
hope
to
find
a
quieter
cheaper
place
to
live
so
we
had
no
trouble
getting
help
skill
is
essential
for
most
of
the
work
it
not
much
of
a
trick
nowadays
to
get
by
in
most
factories
the
machines
do
most
of
the
thinking
for
you
and
that
good
in
some
ways
only
the
men
that
the
machines
ca
work
up
much
pride
in
the
output
things
go
well
enough
when
business
is
good
but
when
the
factory
begins
to
run
short
time
and
lay
men
off
like
it
did
last
winter
there
trouble
wanted
to
know
what
sort
of
trouble
oh
well
said
macpherson
strikes
hurt
worst
at
the
time
but
strikes
are
just
like
boils
a
sign
of
something
wrong
inside
and
and
well
ye
ca
expect
the
factory
to
go
on
making
golden
oak
rockers
just
to
store
in
the
sheds
somebody
has
to
buy
but
the
boys
ai
happy
over
weeks
let
alone
no
jobs
at
all
his
sociology
professor
at
cartwright
recalled
had
talked
a
good
deal
about
the
labor
question
but
maybe
this
foreman
knew
something
about
it
too
so
put
it
up
to
him
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
macpherson
what
makes
the
thing
the
papers
call
unrest
macpherson
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
settled
himself
more
comfortably
on
a
pile
of
boards
and
proceeded
to
deliver
his
soul
or
part
of
it
i
can
tell
you
but
there
them
that
would
ship
me
out
of
town
if
i
talked
too
much
so
i
have
to
be
careful
john
wesley
you
got
a
grand
name
and
the
church
john
wesley
started
has
a
good
name
though
it
not
my
church
i
a
scot
you
know
but
i
know
your
preacher
and
he
and
i
are
of
the
same
mind
about
this
i
know
well
then
if
your
methodist
church
could
find
a
method
with
labor
it
would
get
hold
of
the
same
sort
of
common
people
as
the
ones
who
heard
jesus
gladly
these
are
not
in
the
way
of
being
saints
ye
ken
but
they
think
that
somewhere
there
is
a
rotten
spot
in
the
world
of
factories
and
shops
and
mills
they
think
they
learn
from
experience
who
by
the
way
is
the
dominie
of
a
school
that
they
get
most
of
the
losses
and
few
of
the
profits
of
industry
they
get
a
living
wage
when
times
are
good
when
times
are
bad
they
lose
the
one
thing
they
got
to
sell
and
that
their
day
work
when
a
loafing
day
is
gone
nothing
to
show
for
it
and
no
way
to
make
it
up
maybe
that
as
it
should
be
but
the
worker
ca
see
it
especially
if
the
boss
can
still
buy
gasoline
and
tires
when
the
plant
is
idle
oh
yes
laddie
i
know
the
working
man
is
headstrong
i
tell
you
privately
i
think
he
a
fool
because
so
often
he
gets
into
a
blind
rage
and
wants
to
smash
the
very
tools
that
earn
his
bite
and
sup
he
may
have
reason
to
hate
some
employer
but
why
hate
the
job
it
a
good
job
if
he
makes
good
chairs
he
goes
on
strike
many
the
time
without
caring
that
it
hurts
him
and
his
worse
than
it
hurts
the
boss
and
often
the
boss
thinks
he
wants
nothing
bigger
than
a
few
more
things
maybe
he
wild
for
a
phonograph
and
a
ford
and
golden
oak
rockers
of
his
own
in
the
parlor
and
photographs
enlarged
in
crayon
hanging
on
the
walls
and
a
steady
job
but
listen
to
me
john
wesley
and
you
be
a
credit
to
your
namesake
these
wild
unreasonable
workers
with
all
their
foolishness
and
sometimes
wickedness
are
whiles
dreaming
of
a
different
world
a
better
world
for
everybody
be
no
harm
if
some
bosses
dreamed
more
about
that
too
me
boy
your
preacher
he
a
fine
man
too
is
drury
he
understands
that
and
he
wants
to
use
it
for
something
to
build
on
that
why
i
tell
folks
he
a
methodist
preacher
with
a
real
method
in
his
ministry
now
i
quit
me
fashin
and
get
back
to
the
job
i
doubt
you
be
busy
yourself
this
afternoon
he
gripped
hand
so
that
the
knuckles
were
unable
to
forget
him
all
day
but
what
he
had
said
gripped
harder
than
his
handshake
if
the
furniture
factory
was
a
mixed
blessing
what
of
the
cannery
somewhat
to
his
own
surprise
was
getting
interested
in
his
town
but
if
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
wonder
how
he
happened
to
develop
all
this
new
concern
he
soon
ceased
to
think
of
it
so
slight
a
matter
could
not
stay
in
the
front
of
his
thinking
when
he
really
began
to
know
something
of
the
delafield
to
which
he
had
never
paid
much
attention
it
was
through
joe
carbrook
that
he
got
his
next
jolt
joe
now
spending
his
vacations
in
ways
that
amazed
people
who
had
memories
of
his
wild
younger
manner
was
in
and
out
of
the
farwell
store
a
good
deal
also
he
spent
considerable
time
with
pastor
drury
though
there
is
no
record
of
what
they
talked
about
old
boy
joe
asked
one
day
coming
away
from
the
study
have
you
ever
by
any
chance
observed
main
street
why
yes
answered
seeing
that
two
or
three
or
four
times
a
day
i
walk
six
blocks
of
it
back
and
forth
to
this
store
door
i
suppose
i
have
oh
yes
that
way
joe
came
back
at
him
and
you
seen
me
a
thousand
times
but
did
you
ever
observe
me
my
ears
for
instance
and
he
put
his
hands
over
them
which
one
is
the
larger
without
in
the
least
understanding
what
his
friend
was
driving
at
and
stupidly
wondering
if
he
ever
had
noticed
any
difference
in
joe
ears
stared
with
inane
bewilderment
is
one
really
larger
than
the
other
he
asked
helplessly
joe
took
his
hands
down
and
laughed
i
knew
it
he
said
never
observed
my
ears
and
yet
you
think
you
have
observed
main
street
as
it
happens
each
of
my
ears
takes
the
but
you
did
know
it
well
never
mind
ears
i
thinking
about
main
street
what
do
you
know
of
main
street
thought
he
could
make
up
for
the
ear
question
so
he
said
boldly
joe
carbrook
i
can
name
every
place
from
here
to
the
livery
barn
north
and
from
here
to
the
bridge
south
on
both
sides
of
the
street
want
me
to
prove
it
no
i
do
i
reckon
you
can
but
i
believe
you
still
as
blind
as
i
been
about
main
street
just
the
same
i
know
chicago
pretty
well
and
i
doubt
if
there
as
big
a
percentage
of
graft
and
littleness
and
and
going
to
the
devil
generally
on
state
street
or
wabash
avenue
as
there
is
an
main
street
delafield
you
not
trying
to
say
that
our
business
men
are
crooks
are
you
joe
asked
with
a
touch
of
resentment
you
know
i
happen
to
be
connected
with
a
business
house
on
main
street
myself
sure
i
know
it
and
there
marshall
field
on
state
street
and
lyon
healy
on
wabash
avenue
and
hart
schaffner
marx
over
by
the
chicago
river
just
the
same
as
here
but
i
well
of
course
there
a
story
back
of
it
all
mother
heard
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
that
one
of
our
old
epworth
league
girls
was
having
a
hard
time
of
it
she
working
at
the
racket
store
helping
to
support
her
folks
they
had
sickness
and
the
girl
does
get
big
wages
so
mother
asked
me
to
look
her
up
mother
ca
get
about
very
easily
you
know
and
since
i
studying
medicine
she
seems
to
think
i
the
original
i
made
a
few
discreet
inquiries
discreet
that
is
for
me
and
can
you
guess
who
that
girl
is
you
ca
i
know
well
she
alma
wetherell
and
the
identical
girl
who
gave
me
such
a
dressing
down
one
day
at
the
cartwright
institute
four
years
ago
remember
say
that
day
she
told
me
so
much
of
the
deadly
truth
about
myself
that
i
hated
her
even
more
for
knowing
what
to
say
than
i
did
for
saying
it
but
she
had
a
big
lot
to
do
with
waking
me
up
and
i
owe
her
something
had
not
remembered
the
institute
incident
but
he
recalled
that
alma
was
at
cartwright
that
summer
and
he
had
seen
her
at
church
occasionally
since
he
came
home
from
college
she
was
living
in
town
and
working
in
some
store
or
other
he
knew
but
that
was
all
what
did
you
find
out
he
asked
joe
i
found
out
enough
so
that
alma
has
a
better
job
and
things
are
going
easier
at
home
but
that
was
just
a
starter
my
brave
john
wesley
do
you
remember
your
college
sociology
and
economics
and
civics
and
all
the
rest
never
mind
confessing
you
do
i
did
either
but
i
began
to
review
in
actual
business
practice
first
i
told
the
right
merchant
what
sort
of
a
bookkeeper
i
had
found
slaving
away
for
ten
dollars
a
week
on
the
dark
smelly
balcony
of
the
racket
and
he
given
alma
a
job
at
twenty
in
a
office
then
i
told
peters
of
the
racket
what
i
had
done
and
why
he
did
like
it
but
it
will
do
him
good
that
made
me
feel
able
to
settle
anything
and
i
looking
around
for
my
next
joy
as
journeyman
rescuer
and
expert
business
adjuster
honest
i
not
seen
near
all
there
is
to
see
but
i
swamped
already
you
got
to
come
along
you
and
some
others
and
see
for
yourself
what
the
matter
with
main
street
not
all
at
once
but
before
very
long
shared
joe
aroused
interest
pastor
drury
was
with
them
of
course
and
the
three
called
into
consultation
a
few
other
capable
and
trustworthy
men
and
women
marcia
dayne
had
come
home
for
a
few
weeks
holiday
and
at
once
enlisted
alma
wetherell
was
able
to
give
some
highly
significant
suggestions
there
was
no
noise
of
trumpets
and
no
publicity
of
any
sort
drury
insisted
that
what
they
needed
first
and
most
was
not
newspaper
attention
and
not
even
organization
but
exact
information
so
for
many
days
a
group
of
puzzled
and
increasingly
astonished
people
set
about
the
study
of
their
own
town
principal
street
as
though
they
had
never
seen
it
before
and
in
truth
they
never
had
it
was
no
different
from
all
other
small
town
business
districts
the
gem
theater
vied
with
the
star
and
the
orpheum
in
lavish
display
of
gaudy
posters
advertising
pictures
that
were
coming
and
in
two
weeks
of
observation
the
investigators
learned
what
sort
of
moving
pictures
delafield
demanded
or
at
least
what
sort
it
got
they
took
note
of
the
amethyst
coterie
saturday
night
dances
wardrobe
cents
ladies
free
and
of
the
boys
and
girls
who
patronized
the
place
the
various
cigar
and
combinations
were
quietly
observed
some
of
the
observers
learning
for
the
first
time
that
young
men
are
so
determined
to
get
together
that
they
are
not
to
be
deterred
by
dirt
or
bad
air
or
foul
and
brainless
talk
the
candy
stores
with
soda
fountains
and
some
of
the
drug
stores
which
served
refreshments
took
on
a
new
importance
instead
of
being
no
more
than
handy
purveyors
of
sweets
of
soft
drinks
and
household
remedies
they
were
seen
to
be
also
social
centers
places
for
dates
and
telephone
flirtations
and
dalliance
much
of
their
doings
was
the
merest
silly
but
generally
the
youthful
patrons
welcomed
all
this
because
it
was
a
change
from
the
empty
dullness
of
homes
that
had
missed
the
home
secret
and
from
the
still
duller
and
wasting
monotony
of
uninteresting
toil
it
was
pastor
drury
who
suggested
the
explanation
for
all
these
forms
of
profitless
and
often
dangerous
amusement
he
was
chatting
with
the
whole
group
one
night
and
merely
happened
to
address
himself
first
to
jr
your
great
namesake
was
so
much
a
part
of
his
day
that
he
believed
with
most
other
great
religious
thinkers
of
his
time
that
play
was
a
device
of
the
devil
his
belief
belonged
to
theology
and
psychology
but
even
more
it
grew
out
of
the
vicious
diversions
of
the
rich
and
the
brutalizing
amusements
of
the
poor
both
were
bad
and
there
was
not
much
middle
ground
but
here
on
main
street
we
see
people
most
of
them
young
who
feel
without
always
understanding
why
that
they
simply
must
be
amused
they
feel
it
so
strongly
that
they
will
pay
any
price
for
it
if
circumstances
wo
let
them
get
it
any
other
way
and
main
street
is
ready
to
oblige
them
there
could
be
no
amusement
business
if
people
were
not
clamoring
to
be
amused
and
we
know
now
why
we
have
no
right
to
say
that
all
this
clamor
is
the
devil
prompting
is
it
queer
that
the
church
is
only
now
beginning
to
believe
in
the
genuineness
and
wholesomeness
of
the
play
instinct
though
it
is
a
proper
and
natural
human
hunger
literally
everybody
wants
to
play
people
pay
more
for
the
gratification
of
this
hunger
than
they
do
for
bread
or
shoes
or
education
or
religion
they
take
greater
moral
risks
for
it
than
they
do
for
money
we
have
seen
people
who
undoubtedly
are
going
to
the
devil
by
the
amusement
route
unless
something
is
done
to
stop
them
they
go
wrong
quicker
and
oftener
in
their
play
than
in
their
work
are
we
going
to
be
content
with
denouncing
the
dance
hall
and
the
poolroom
and
the
vile
pictures
and
the
loose
conduct
of
the
places
and
electric
park
have
we
some
sort
of
duty
to
see
that
every
young
person
in
delafield
has
a
chance
at
enjoyable
and
decent
play
all
agreed
that
the
pastor
was
right
though
they
were
not
so
clear
about
what
could
be
done
but
commercialized
amusement
was
not
all
they
found
in
their
quiet
voyages
of
discovery
up
and
down
main
street
the
chain
stores
had
come
to
delafield
not
the
and
only
but
stores
which
specialized
in
groceries
tobacco
shoes
dry
goods
drugs
and
other
commodities
alongside
of
them
were
the
locally
owned
stores
altogether
main
street
had
far
too
many
stores
to
afford
good
service
or
reasonable
prices
with
all
this
duplication
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
main
street
was
a
street
of
underlings
clerks
and
salespeople
and
delivery
men
that
condition
produced
low
wages
and
inefficient
methods
many
of
the
workers
being
too
young
to
be
out
of
school
and
too
dense
to
show
any
intelligence
about
the
work
they
were
supposed
to
do
cheap
help
was
costly
and
the
efficient
help
was
scarcely
to
be
found
at
any
price
the
investigators
were
frankly
dismayed
at
the
extent
and
complexity
of
the
situation
they
had
thought
to
find
occasional
cases
calling
for
adjustment
or
even
for
the
law
but
instead
they
had
found
a
whole
fabric
of
interwoven
questions
amusements
wages
competition
cooperation
ignorance
vulgarity
vice
cheapness
trickery
business
is
business
true
they
had
found
more
honest
businesses
than
shady
ones
more
faithful
clerks
than
shirkers
more
decent
people
in
the
pleasure
resorts
than
doubtful
people
but
the
total
of
folly
and
evil
was
very
great
could
the
church
do
anything
to
decrease
it
and
that
question
led
the
little
company
of
inquisitive
christians
into
yet
wider
reaches
of
inquiry
and
joe
and
marcia
at
suggestion
agreed
to
be
a
sort
of
unofficial
committee
to
find
out
about
the
churches
of
delafield
he
told
them
that
this
was
first
of
all
a
work
for
laymen
the
preachers
might
come
in
later
joe
invited
the
others
to
the
new
carbrook
home
on
the
heights
into
which
his
people
had
lately
moved
the
heights
was
a
new
thing
to
a
rather
exclusive
residential
quarter
which
had
been
laid
out
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
with
houses
in
the
midst
of
wide
lawns
a
heights
club
house
and
tennis
courts
and
an
exquisite
little
gothic
church
when
our
folks
first
talked
about
moving
out
here
i
thought
it
was
all
right
and
i
do
yet
in
some
ways
explained
joe
but
the
heights
is
getting
a
little
too
good
for
me
i
not
as
keen
about
being
exclusive
as
i
used
to
be
i
thought
lately
that
exclusiveness
may
be
just
as
bad
for
people
inside
the
gates
as
for
the
people
outside
but
here
we
are
as
the
atlantic
city
whale
said
when
the
ebb
tide
stranded
it
in
front
of
the
board
walk
what
are
we
up
to
us
three
we
up
to
finding
out
about
the
town
churches
said
maybe
they
can
help
the
town
more
than
they
do
but
we
do
know
how
and
so
far
we
have
found
anybody
else
who
knows
how
and
marcia
said
at
least
we
know
some
things
we
have
the
figures
about
one
delafield
citizen
in
seven
goes
to
church
or
sunday
school
on
sunday
church
membership
is
one
in
ten
and
as
many
people
go
to
the
movies
and
the
columbia
vaudeville
and
the
dance
halls
and
poolrooms
on
saturday
as
go
to
church
on
sunday
to
say
nothing
of
the
crowds
that
go
on
the
other
five
days
joe
carbrook
whistled
that
a
tough
nut
to
crack
gentle
people
he
said
because
you
simply
got
to
think
of
those
other
five
days
the
chances
are
that
four
times
as
many
people
in
delafield
go
to
other
public
places
as
go
to
church
and
sunday
school
what
can
the
churches
do
asked
you
ca
make
people
go
to
church
no
assented
marcia
and
if
you
could
it
would
be
foolish
we
want
to
make
people
like
the
churches
not
hate
them
one
thing
i
believe
our
churches
can
do
is
to
put
their
public
services
more
into
methods
and
forms
that
do
have
to
be
taken
for
granted
or
just
mentally
dodged
half
the
time
people
do
know
what
a
religious
service
really
stands
for
meaning
by
that
joe
queried
as
much
to
hear
marcia
talk
as
for
the
sake
of
what
she
might
say
well
they
have
seen
and
heard
it
since
they
were
children
when
they
were
little
they
did
understand
it
and
now
it
is
so
familiar
that
they
forget
they
do
understand
it
marcia
responded
not
wholly
oblivious
of
joe
strategy
but
too
much
in
earnest
to
care
heard
of
a
successful
preacher
in
the
east
who
seems
to
be
making
them
understand
he
says
he
tries
to
put
into
each
service
four
things
light
music
motion
that
is
change
and
a
touch
of
the
dramatic
why
not
i
think
it
could
be
done
without
destroying
the
solemnity
of
the
worship
they
did
it
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
and
they
do
it
in
saint
peter
at
rome
and
in
westminster
abbey
and
saint
john
cathedral
in
new
york
why
should
we
do
it
here
in
our
little
churches
make
a
note
of
it
ordered
joe
it
worth
suggesting
to
some
of
the
preachers
made
his
note
rather
absently
and
offered
a
conclusion
of
his
own
the
church
must
take
note
of
the
town
sore
spots
too
i
found
out
that
crowding
people
in
tenements
and
shacks
means
disease
and
immorality
is
that
the
church
affair
angus
macpherson
has
taught
me
that
when
the
jobs
are
gone
little
crimes
come
followed
by
bigger
ones
and
sickness
comes
too
with
the
death
rate
going
up
babies
are
born
to
unmarried
mothers
and
babies
with
names
or
without
die
off
a
lot
faster
in
the
river
shacks
and
the
east
side
tenements
than
they
do
up
this
way
maybe
the
church
could
help
all
this
even
if
it
knew
but
i
for
asking
it
to
know
i
vote
for
that
joe
asserted
if
you
vote
for
my
proposition
which
is
this
our
churches
must
quit
trying
just
to
be
prosperous
they
must
quit
competing
for
business
like
rival
barkers
at
a
street
fair
they
must
begin
to
find
out
that
their
only
reason
for
existence
is
the
service
they
can
give
to
those
who
need
it
most
they
got
to
believe
in
each
other
and
work
with
each
other
and
with
all
the
other
town
forces
that
are
trying
to
make
a
better
delafield
that
right
said
i
was
talking
to
drury
this
morning
and
i
asked
him
what
he
would
think
of
our
starting
a
suggestion
list
he
said
it
ought
to
be
a
fine
thing
but
he
wants
us
to
do
it
all
ourselves
just
the
same
we
can
take
our
suggestions
to
him
and
then
if
he
believes
in
them
he
can
talk
to
the
other
preachers
about
them
and
of
course
about
any
ideas
of
his
own
because
you
know
i
pretty
sure
he
has
been
thinking
about
all
this
a
good
deal
longer
than
we
have
it
was
agreed
that
the
list
should
be
started
marcia
was
not
willing
to
keep
it
to
themselves
she
wanted
to
have
it
talked
about
in
league
and
sunday
school
and
prayer
meeting
and
then
when
everybody
had
been
given
the
chance
to
add
to
it
and
to
improve
on
it
but
not
to
weaken
it
that
it
be
put
out
for
general
discussion
among
all
the
churches
and
then
said
joe
carbrook
we
might
call
it
everyday
doctrines
of
delafield
if
we
stick
to
the
things
every
citizen
will
admit
he
ought
to
believe
and
do
the
churches
will
still
have
all
the
chance
they
have
now
to
preach
those
things
which
must
be
left
to
the
individual
conscience
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
document
with
which
delafield
was
to
become
very
familiar
in
the
months
which
followed
never
before
had
the
town
been
so
generally
interested
in
one
set
of
ideas
and
to
this
day
you
can
always
start
a
conversation
there
by
mentioning
the
everyday
doctrines
of
delafield
the
methodist
preacher
gave
them
their
final
form
but
he
took
no
credit
for
the
substance
of
them
though
secretly
he
was
vastly
proud
that
the
young
people
and
especially
should
have
so
thoroughly
followed
up
his
first
suggestion
of
a
civic
creed
the
everyday
doctrines
of
delafield
every
part
of
delafield
is
as
much
delafield
as
any
other
part
we
are
citizens
of
a
commonwealth
and
delafield
should
be
in
fact
as
well
as
name
a
democratic
community
whenever
two
delafield
citizens
can
better
do
something
for
the
town
than
one
could
do
it
they
should
get
together
and
the
same
holds
good
for
twenty
citizens
or
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
one
of
the
town
mottoes
should
be
delafield
is
not
divided
everything
will
help
delafield
if
it
means
better
people
in
better
homes
with
better
chances
at
giving
their
children
the
right
but
anything
which
merely
means
more
people
or
more
money
or
more
business
is
likely
to
cost
more
than
it
comes
to
we
will
boost
for
delafield
therefore
but
we
will
first
be
careful
every
part
of
delafield
is
entitled
to
clean
streets
and
plenty
of
air
water
and
sunlight
it
is
perhaps
possible
to
be
a
christian
amid
ugliness
and
filth
but
it
is
not
easy
and
it
is
not
necessary
every
family
in
delafield
has
the
right
to
a
place
that
can
be
made
into
a
home
at
a
cost
that
will
permit
of
family
proper
privacy
and
the
ordinary
decencies
of
civilized
living
every
case
of
poverty
in
delafield
should
be
considered
as
a
reflection
on
the
town
as
being
preventable
and
curable
by
remedies
which
any
town
that
is
careful
of
its
good
name
can
apply
delafield
believes
that
beauty
pays
better
than
ugliness
therefore
she
is
for
trees
and
flowers
green
lawns
and
clean
streets
paint
where
it
properly
belongs
and
everybody
setting
a
good
example
by
caring
for
his
own
premises
and
so
inciting
his
neighbor
to
outdo
him
the
only
industries
delafield
needs
are
those
which
can
provide
for
their
operation
without
forcing
workers
to
be
idle
so
much
of
the
time
as
to
reduce
apparent
income
and
so
to
cause
poverty
sickness
and
temptation
to
wrongdoing
the
standard
of
income
ought
to
be
for
the
year
and
not
by
the
day
in
the
interest
of
homes
rather
than
in
the
interest
of
lodging
houses
and
lunch
rooms
delafield
can
support
or
should
find
ways
to
support
the
workers
needed
in
her
stores
shops
and
factories
at
fair
pay
without
making
use
of
children
who
should
continue
in
school
and
without
reckoning
on
the
desperation
of
those
made
poor
by
their
dependence
on
a
job
amusements
in
delafield
can
be
and
ought
to
be
clean
and
available
for
everybody
this
calls
for
playgrounds
and
weekday
playtime
as
well
as
plenty
of
recreational
opportunities
provided
by
the
churches
without
features
the
forms
of
amusement
provided
for
pay
can
be
and
should
be
influenced
by
public
opinion
positively
expressed
rather
than
by
public
indifference
any
picture
house
would
rather
be
praised
for
bringing
a
good
picture
to
town
than
condemned
for
showing
a
bad
one
picture
people
enjoy
praise
as
much
as
preachers
do
delafield
many
organizations
should
tell
the
whole
town
what
they
are
trying
to
do
so
that
unnecessary
duplication
of
plan
and
purpose
may
first
be
discovered
and
then
done
away
with
whenever
a
delafield
church
or
club
or
society
proposes
to
engage
in
a
work
that
is
to
benefit
the
town
the
plan
ought
to
be
made
known
and
in
due
time
the
results
should
be
published
as
widely
as
was
the
plan
this
will
help
us
to
learn
by
our
delafield
failures
as
well
as
by
our
delafield
successes
the
churches
of
delafield
are
delafield
property
as
the
schools
are
though
paid
for
in
a
different
way
neither
schools
nor
churches
exist
for
their
own
sakes
but
for
delafield
and
then
some
every
church
in
delafield
should
have
a
definite
parish
and
every
section
or
group
should
have
a
church
the
churched
should
lead
in
providing
for
the
unchurched
and
the
overchurched
might
spare
out
of
their
abundance
of
workers
and
equipment
some
of
the
resources
that
are
needed
the
first
concern
of
all
the
churches
should
be
to
reach
the
unchurched
and
to
make
church
friends
of
the
this
goes
for
all
the
churches
it
is
more
important
to
get
the
sense
of
god
and
principles
of
jesus
into
the
thought
of
the
whole
town
than
to
set
protestant
and
roman
catholic
in
mutually
suspicious
and
hateful
opposition
devout
jew
and
sincere
christian
must
realize
that
righteousness
in
delafield
can
not
be
attended
to
by
either
without
the
other
the
churches
of
delafield
believe
that
all
matters
of
social
concern
work
wages
housing
health
amusement
and
morals
are
part
of
every
church
business
therefore
they
will
not
cease
to
urge
their
members
always
to
deal
with
these
matters
as
christian
citizens
not
merely
as
christians
every
child
and
young
person
in
delafield
ought
to
be
in
the
day
school
on
weekdays
and
in
sunday
school
on
sunday
delafield
discourages
needless
absence
from
one
as
much
as
from
the
other
delafield
wants
the
best
possible
teachers
teaching
in
all
her
schools
she
insists
on
trained
teachers
on
week
days
and
needs
them
on
sundays
therefore
she
believes
that
is
part
of
every
church
duty
to
delafield
there
one
thing
about
all
this
that
bothers
me
said
when
they
had
finished
the
final
draft
of
the
every
day
doctrines
not
that
the
only
one
but
some
of
these
doctrines
stand
small
chance
of
being
put
into
practice
until
the
church
people
are
willing
to
spend
more
money
on
such
work
it
ca
be
done
on
the
present
income
of
the
churches
or
by
the
usual
methods
that
a
fact
joe
carbrook
agreed
i
already
made
up
my
mind
that
the
carbrooks
would
have
to
dig
a
little
deeper
and
so
must
everybody
else
who
cares
yes
but
how
to
get
everybody
else
to
care
that
the
trouble
persisted
dad
one
of
the
stewards
you
know
and
they
find
it
no
easy
job
to
collect
even
what
the
church
needs
now
they
have
a
deficit
to
worry
with
every
year
almost
marcia
dayne
was
the
only
other
member
of
the
let
know
delafield
group
who
happened
to
be
present
at
this
last
meeting
she
had
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
speak
i
surprised
at
you
two
she
said
do
you
know
the
only
really
workable
financial
way
out
well
not
exactly
admitted
i
suppose
if
we
could
only
get
people
to
care
more
they
would
give
more
it
a
matter
of
letting
them
know
the
need
and
all
that
i
guess
for
instance
marcia
was
not
ready
for
his
for
instances
john
wesley
she
interrupted
with
mock
severity
as
a
thinker
you
have
shone
at
times
with
a
good
deal
more
brilliance
than
that
if
you
had
said
it
just
the
other
way
you
would
have
been
nearer
right
people
give
if
they
care
of
course
but
it
is
even
more
certain
that
they
will
care
if
they
give
the
thing
we
need
is
to
show
them
how
to
give
joe
carbrook
broke
into
an
incredulous
laugh
in
other
words
my
fair
marcia
you
want
christians
to
give
before
they
care
what
it
is
they
are
giving
to
or
even
know
about
it
do
you
think
our
church
will
be
a
long
time
financing
the
every
day
doctrines
on
that
system
joe
and
marcia
never
hesitated
to
take
opposite
sides
in
a
discussion
and
always
with
frankness
so
marcia
came
back
promptly
i
know
you
think
it
unreasonable
she
said
but
there
a
condition
you
overlook
we
became
christians
long
before
any
of
us
thought
about
studying
delafield
needs
and
if
we
and
all
the
rest
of
the
christians
of
the
town
had
accepted
our
financial
relation
to
the
kingdom
and
had
acted
on
it
from
the
start
there
would
always
be
money
enough
and
to
spare
oh
yes
joe
said
understandingly
i
see
now
you
mean
the
tithe
marcia
knew
no
matter
how
that
joe
had
begun
to
think
about
tithing
and
this
seemed
the
opportune
time
to
stress
it
a
little
more
it
could
help
the
every
day
doctrines
and
both
joe
and
were
keen
for
that
so
marcia
admitted
that
she
did
mean
the
tithe
i
do
pretend
to
know
how
it
began
any
more
than
i
know
how
real
homes
were
established
after
the
fall
or
how
keeping
sunday
began
i
do
know
these
began
long
before
there
was
any
fourth
or
fifth
commandment
or
any
children
of
israel
and
i
gone
over
all
the
whole
subject
with
drury
he
has
a
lot
of
practical
pamphlets
on
the
tithe
i
believe
that
it
is
the
easiest
surest
fairest
and
cheerfulest
way
of
doing
two
christian
things
at
once
acknowledging
god
ownership
of
all
we
have
and
going
into
partnership
with
god
in
his
work
for
the
world
what
the
books
sometimes
call
christian
stewardship
i
like
to
see
those
pamphlets
said
it
queer
you
have
seen
them
before
this
said
marcia
drury
has
distributed
hundreds
of
them
but
maybe
that
was
when
you
were
away
at
cartwright
anyway
i
get
some
for
you
joe
was
holding
his
thought
to
the
main
matter
marcia
said
he
if
you
can
make
good
on
what
you
said
just
now
pamphlets
or
no
pamphlets
i
agree
to
become
a
tither
first
to
start
where
you
did
how
is
tithing
easier
than
giving
whenever
you
feel
like
giving
now
though
marcia
expected
no
such
challenge
she
was
game
i
not
the
one
to
prove
all
that
but
i
believe
what
i
said
and
i
try
to
make
good
as
you
put
it
but
please
do
say
when
you
talk
about
tithing
or
even
about
any
sort
of
financial
plan
for
christians
the
first
word
is
giving
comes
afterward
well
then
tithing
is
the
easiest
way
because
when
you
are
a
tither
you
always
have
tithing
money
you
begin
by
setting
the
tenth
apart
for
these
uses
and
it
is
no
more
hardship
to
pay
it
out
than
to
pay
out
any
other
money
that
you
have
been
given
with
instructions
for
its
use
not
bad
at
all
said
joe
now
tell
us
why
it
is
the
surest
way
of
using
a
christian
money
by
this
time
marcia
was
beginning
to
enjoy
herself
it
is
the
surest
because
it
almost
collects
itself
no
begging
no
schemes
you
have
tithing
money
on
hand
and
you
have
almost
always
therefore
you
need
to
be
coaxed
into
thinking
you
can
spare
it
if
the
cause
is
a
real
claim
that
all
you
need
to
find
out
and
when
you
begin
to
put
money
into
any
cause
you
going
to
get
interested
in
that
cause
besides
when
all
christians
tithe
there
will
be
more
than
enough
money
for
every
good
work
had
not
thought
much
of
the
tithe
except
as
being
one
of
those
religious
fads
and
he
knew
that
every
church
had
a
few
religious
faddists
but
he
had
long
cherished
a
vast
respect
for
marcia
good
sense
and
what
she
was
saying
seemed
reasonable
enough
he
wondered
if
it
could
be
backed
up
by
evidence
joe
smilingly
took
up
the
next
excellence
of
the
tithe
which
marcia
had
named
let
me
see
did
you
say
that
the
tithe
is
the
fairest
of
all
christian
financial
schemes
not
that
exactly
marcia
corrected
i
said
it
was
the
fairest
way
of
acknowledging
god
ownership
and
of
working
with
him
in
partnership
and
it
is
it
puts
definiteness
in
the
place
of
whim
it
is
proportional
to
our
circumstances
it
is
not
difficult
drury
says
that
forty
years
search
has
failed
to
find
a
tither
who
has
suffered
hardship
because
of
paying
the
tithe
well
joe
put
in
if
marcia
can
produce
the
evidence
on
these
three
points
you
may
as
well
take
the
fourth
for
granted
if
tithing
is
the
easiest
surest
and
fairest
plan
of
christian
stewardship
seems
to
me
it
just
got
to
be
cheerful
i
going
to
look
into
it
and
if
right
as
i
should
wonder
it
up
to
you
and
me
to
get
our
finances
onto
the
ten
per
cent
basis
joe
was
never
a
reluctant
convert
to
anything
when
he
saw
the
new
way
his
instinct
was
for
immediate
action
let
go
over
to
drury
he
proposed
and
see
if
we
ca
settle
this
thing
i
hope
marcia
right
and
he
looked
into
her
eyes
with
a
glance
of
something
more
than
friendly
and
if
she
is
i
ready
to
begin
tithing
pastor
drury
always
a
busy
man
reckoned
interviews
like
this
as
urgent
business
always
not
once
nor
twice
but
many
times
in
the
course
of
a
year
his
quiet
indirect
work
resulted
in
similar
expeditions
to
his
study
and
as
a
rule
he
knew
about
when
to
expect
them
he
produced
the
pamphlets
added
a
few
suggestions
of
his
own
and
let
the
three
young
people
do
most
of
the
talking
they
stayed
a
long
time
no
one
caring
about
that
as
they
were
thanking
the
pastor
before
leaving
joe
said
with
his
usual
directness
marcia
right
and
here
where
i
begin
to
be
a
systematic
christian
as
far
as
my
dealings
with
money
are
concerned
not
in
the
least
ashamed
to
follow
joe
lead
said
same
here
wish
i
known
it
sooner
now
we
got
to
preach
it
and
joe
said
to
drury
in
the
last
moment
at
the
door
drury
if
we
could
all
get
a
conscience
about
the
tithe
and
pay
attention
to
that
conscience
half
the
everyday
doctrines
would
not
even
need
to
be
stated
they
would
be
and
the
other
half
could
be
put
into
practice
with
a
bang
the
delafield
got
hold
of
a
copy
of
the
everyday
doctrines
and
printed
the
whole
of
it
with
a
not
unfavorable
editorial
comment
under
the
caption
when
will
all
this
come
true
but
walter
drury
when
he
saw
it
said
to
himself
it
has
already
come
true
in
a
very
real
sense
for
john
wesley
and
these
others
believe
in
it
and
he
knew
it
marked
one
more
stage
of
the
experiment
so
that
he
could
thank
god
and
take
courage
chapter
v
here
the
alien
there
the
little
brown
church
it
was
all
very
well
to
work
out
the
everyday
doctrines
of
delafield
to
secure
their
adoption
and
application
by
all
the
churches
of
delafield
was
another
matter
the
unofficial
committee
scattered
for
one
thing
joe
carbrook
went
back
to
medical
school
and
marcia
to
the
settlement
and
the
training
school
marty
was
traveling
his
circuit
and
the
pastor
and
a
few
others
continued
their
studies
of
the
town
nobody
had
yet
ventured
to
talk
about
experts
but
it
began
to
be
evident
that
the
situation
would
soon
require
thoroughgoing
and
skilled
assistance
otherwise
all
that
had
been
learned
would
surely
be
lost
one
day
in
the
late
fall
a
stranger
dropped
in
at
the
farwell
hardware
store
and
asked
for
farwell
jr
he
had
called
first
on
pastor
drury
who
was
expecting
him
and
that
diplomat
had
said
to
him
go
see
i
think
he
help
you
to
get
something
started
with
two
of
the
other
clerks
was
unloading
a
shipment
of
stovepipes
the
marks
of
his
task
were
conspicuous
all
over
him
and
he
scarcely
looked
the
part
of
the
young
methodist
but
the
visitor
was
accustomed
to
know
men
when
he
saw
them
under
all
sorts
of
disguises
called
to
the
front
of
the
store
met
the
visitor
with
a
questioning
gaze
farwell
i
am
manford
conover
of
philadelphia
back
there
we
have
heard
something
of
the
doctrines
of
delafield
and
i
been
sent
to
find
out
about
them
and
their
authors
sent
repeated
why
should
anybody
send
you
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
to
delafield
just
for
that
he
could
not
know
how
much
pastoral
and
even
episcopal
planning
was
back
of
that
afternoon
call
do
think
that
we
reckon
it
to
be
unimportant
farwell
said
conover
pleasantly
you
see
i
from
a
methodist
society
with
a
long
name
and
a
business
as
big
as
its
name
the
board
of
home
missions
and
church
extension
the
thing
some
of
you
are
starting
here
in
delafield
is
our
sort
of
thing
it
may
supply
our
board
with
new
business
in
its
line
and
what
we
can
do
for
you
may
make
your
local
work
productive
of
lasting
results
in
other
places
as
well
as
here
did
not
quite
understand
but
he
was
willing
to
be
instructed
for
he
had
found
out
that
the
effort
to
promote
the
everyday
doctrines
was
forever
developing
new
possibilities
and
at
the
same
time
revealing
new
expanses
of
delafield
ignorance
and
need
anybody
who
appeared
to
have
intelligence
and
interest
was
the
more
welcome
they
talked
a
while
and
then
i
tell
you
what
proposed
how
long
do
you
expect
to
be
in
town
conover
replied
that
as
yet
he
had
made
no
arrangement
for
leaving
then
let
get
together
a
few
people
after
prayer
meeting
our
pastor
of
course
and
the
editor
of
the
he
the
right
sort
if
he
does
boost
a
good
deal
and
miss
leigh
of
the
high
school
she
all
right
every
way
and
whitehill
the
president
of
the
woman
association
of
our
church
that
the
missionary
societies
and
the
ladies
aid
merged
into
one
she
a
regular
progressive
and
harry
field
who
just
getting
hold
of
his
job
in
the
league
and
the
sunday
school
superintendent
that
dad
you
know
he
had
the
job
for
a
couple
of
years
now
and
he
as
keen
about
it
as
harry
is
over
the
league
they
got
together
and
out
of
that
first
simple
discussion
came
all
sorts
of
new
difficulties
for
delafield
methodism
to
face
and
master
manford
conover
was
a
preacher
with
a
business
man
training
and
viewpoint
he
may
have
mentioned
his
official
title
when
he
first
appeared
but
nobody
remembered
it
when
people
could
think
of
his
name
he
was
the
man
from
the
board
which
was
all
the
same
to
him
after
that
first
night
meeting
conover
gave
several
days
to
walks
about
delafield
had
found
the
shacks
and
the
tenements
and
joe
carbrook
had
introduced
to
main
street
but
it
was
left
to
conover
to
show
him
europe
and
africa
in
delafield
there
a
certain
town
in
a
middle
western
state
far
better
known
than
delafield
rich
intelligent
highly
its
churches
and
schools
and
clubs
are
matters
for
complacent
satisfaction
and
you
would
be
safe
in
saying
that
not
one
in
five
of
its
people
know
that
the
town
has
a
negro
quarter
an
italian
section
a
bohemian
settlement
a
scandinavian
community
a
greek
colony
and
some
other
centers
of
cultures
and
customs
alien
to
what
they
assume
is
the
town
distinctive
character
they
know
of
course
that
such
people
live
in
the
town
could
help
knowing
it
their
maids
are
scandinavian
or
negro
they
buy
vegetables
and
candy
from
the
greeks
they
hear
of
bootlegging
and
blind
tigers
among
certain
foreign
groups
the
rough
work
of
the
town
is
done
by
men
who
speak
little
or
no
english
but
all
this
makes
small
impression
it
is
a
commonplace
of
american
town
life
and
scarcely
ever
does
it
present
itself
as
something
to
be
looked
into
or
needing
to
be
understood
so
conover
found
it
to
be
with
delafield
the
everyday
doctrines
were
well
enough
but
he
knew
a
good
deal
of
spade
work
must
be
done
before
they
could
take
root
and
grow
he
fronted
a
condition
which
has
its
counterpart
in
most
american
towns
each
of
which
is
two
towns
one
being
certain
and
delimited
areas
where
languages
and
braces
live
amid
conditions
far
removed
from
the
american
notion
of
what
is
endurable
and
the
other
the
better
part
of
town
sometimes
smugly
called
the
residence
section
where
white
americans
have
homes
conover
and
pastor
drury
compared
notes
they
were
of
one
mind
as
to
the
conditions
which
conover
had
found
conditions
not
surprising
to
the
minister
who
knew
more
about
delafield
than
any
of
his
own
people
suspected
one
afternoon
they
met
on
the
street
and
he
led
them
into
a
candy
store
for
hot
chocolate
as
they
sipped
the
chocolate
they
talked
as
usual
saying
whatever
he
happened
to
think
of
say
conover
he
remarked
i
notice
in
all
your
talk
about
the
foreigner
in
america
you
have
once
referred
to
the
idea
of
the
melting
pot
do
you
think
that
just
what
america
is
all
these
people
coming
here
and
getting
americanized
and
assimilated
and
all
that
i
think
america
was
the
melting
pot
if
i
could
see
more
signs
of
the
melting
conover
answered
but
look
at
delafield
how
much
does
the
melting
pot
melt
here
then
he
looked
across
the
store
do
you
know
the
proprietor
mr
farwell
he
asked
yes
indeed
nick
and
i
are
good
friends
answered
then
i
wish
you
introduce
me
returned
conover
oh
nick
called
will
you
come
over
here
a
minute
nick
came
wiping
his
hands
on
his
apron
nick
said
doing
the
honors
you
know
drury
the
pastor
of
our
church
and
this
is
conover
from
philadelphia
a
very
good
friend
of
ours
he
been
looking
around
town
and
wants
to
ask
you
something
nick
brisk
and
cheerful
manner
was
at
its
best
for
he
liked
besides
liking
the
trade
he
brought
sure
said
he
i
tell
him
anything
if
i
know
it
glad
for
the
chance
dulas
said
conover
he
had
taken
note
of
the
name
on
the
window
you
know
the
east
side
pretty
well
do
you
then
you
know
that
many
italians
live
just
north
of
linden
street
and
there
a
block
or
so
of
polish
homes
between
linden
and
the
next
street
south
sure
i
do
said
nick
confidently
i
live
on
other
side
of
them
myself
see
every
day
very
well
conover
went
on
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
how
do
the
italians
and
the
poles
get
along
together
they
do
have
nothing
much
to
do
with
one
another
nick
replied
it
like
this
the
poles
they
talk
polish
and
maybe
a
little
english
the
italians
they
speak
italian
and
some
can
talk
english
only
not
much
but
poles
they
ca
talk
italian
at
all
and
italians
ca
talk
polish
so
how
could
they
get
together
that
just
the
question
dulas
conover
agreed
i
telling
these
gentlemen
that
it
is
harder
for
the
different
people
to
know
one
another
and
to
be
friendly
with
one
another
than
it
is
for
them
to
know
and
associate
with
americans
sure
mister
nick
said
with
great
positiveness
sure
before
i
speak
english
i
know
nobody
but
greeks
and
when
i
start
learning
english
i
got
no
time
to
learn
polish
or
italian
or
whatever
it
is
english
i
got
to
speak
if
i
run
a
candy
store
but
not
those
other
languages
and
he
went
off
to
serve
a
customer
who
had
just
entered
there
you
have
that
side
said
conover
to
the
minister
and
the
need
of
english
as
an
americanizing
force
and
the
meed
of
it
as
a
medium
of
communication
between
the
different
foreign
groups
looks
as
though
we
got
to
bear
down
hard
on
english
do
you
think
as
nick
says
i
do
drury
assented
it
will
come
out
all
right
with
the
children
i
hope
they
getting
the
english
but
it
makes
things
hard
just
now
what
can
the
church
do
put
in
should
it
undertake
to
teach
english
as
that
preacher
taught
phil
khamis
you
remember
drury
or
americanization
or
what
i
think
it
should
do
something
else
first
said
conover
why
should
we
americans
try
to
make
europeans
understand
us
unless
we
first
try
to
understand
them
is
ours
the
first
move
but
this
is
the
country
they
going
to
live
in
returned
they
ca
expect
us
to
adjust
ourselves
to
european
ways
they
got
to
do
the
adjusting
have
they
why
conover
came
back
because
we
were
here
first
but
the
indian
was
here
before
us
we
told
him
he
need
do
any
adjusting
at
all
and
see
what
we
made
of
him
maybe
these
europeans
can
add
enriching
elements
to
our
american
culture
i
guess
so
but
and
was
evidently
at
a
loss
but
they
got
to
obey
our
laws
you
know
and
fit
into
our
civilization
the
indian
was
different
we
could
make
indians
of
ourselves
and
he
become
civilized
americanized
you
mean
and
conover
laughed
a
little
at
the
irony
of
it
no
no
not
that
but
he
would
meet
us
half
way
even
said
i
think
suggested
pastor
drury
that
what
conover
means
is
that
we
better
be
a
little
less
stiff
to
newcomers
than
the
indian
was
to
us
am
i
right
exactly
right
returned
conover
europe
is
in
a
general
way
the
of
us
all
but
many
of
her
children
were
late
in
getting
here
the
earlier
ones
have
made
their
contributions
why
may
not
the
later
ones
also
bring
gifts
for
our
common
treasure
well
what
in
particular
do
you
mean
asked
who
was
finding
himself
adrift
he
had
been
quite
willing
in
the
institute
days
to
be
an
admirer
of
phil
khamis
and
to
forget
that
phil
was
of
alien
birth
but
this
was
something
more
complicated
particulars
are
not
so
simple
conover
said
but
for
instance
some
european
peoples
have
a
fine
musical
appreciation
some
delight
in
oratory
some
are
mystical
and
dreamy
some
are
very
children
in
their
love
of
color
some
are
almost
artists
in
their
feeling
for
beauty
in
their
work
some
do
not
enjoy
rough
play
and
others
can
not
endure
to
be
quiet
some
have
inherited
a
passionate
love
of
country
and
great
traditions
of
patriotism
we
ca
value
all
these
things
in
just
the
way
they
do
but
at
least
we
can
believe
that
such
interests
and
instincts
are
worth
something
to
america
then
our
americanization
work
will
be
not
only
more
intelligent
but
far
more
sympathetic
if
i
may
turn
to
the
immediate
business
drury
said
with
a
smile
of
apology
suppose
you
tell
what
your
board
has
to
suggest
for
us
here
in
delafield
mr
conover
conover
turned
to
i
wonder
if
you
know
anything
about
centenary
church
he
asked
that
little
old
brick
barn
over
in
the
east
bottoms
why
yes
or
i
used
to
if
was
quite
a
church
when
i
was
a
youngster
but
i
been
that
way
lately
i
guess
it
pretty
much
run
down
with
all
those
foreigners
moving
in
most
of
the
old
members
have
probably
moved
away
i
know
there
were
two
methodist
boys
with
me
in
high
school
who
lived
down
there
but
they
moved
up
to
the
heights
one
of
them
lives
next
to
the
carbrooks
drury
should
take
you
down
that
way
one
of
these
days
said
conover
and
you
find
that
when
your
friends
moved
out
of
the
church
the
foreigners
who
live
nearby
did
not
move
in
centenary
church
is
run
down
as
you
say
drury
added
and
the
few
members
who
are
left
do
know
which
way
to
turn
they
have
a
supply
pastor
who
is
able
to
do
much
he
gets
a
pitiful
salary
but
they
ca
pay
more
and
there
no
money
at
all
nor
any
accommodations
for
any
special
attention
to
the
newcomers
well
said
conover
i
instructed
to
tell
you
delafield
methodists
that
the
board
of
home
missions
and
church
extension
is
ready
to
help
make
a
new
centenary
church
for
the
people
who
now
live
around
it
we
have
a
department
that
pays
special
attention
to
immigrant
and
alien
populations
our
workers
know
in
general
what
is
needed
we
can
put
some
trained
people
into
centenary
with
a
pastor
who
knows
how
to
direct
their
work
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
a
parish
house
there
and
a
modernized
church
building
and
a
fine
array
of
everyday
work
being
done
there
my
but
that
sounds
great
drury
does
it
asked
in
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
then
he
checked
himself
it
sounds
well
enough
he
said
but
all
that
means
a
lot
of
money
where
the
money
to
come
from
from
you
of
course
conover
replied
but
not
all
or
most
from
you
my
board
is
a
benevolent
board
that
is
to
say
it
is
the
whole
church
at
work
in
such
enterprises
as
this
that
one
way
in
which
its
share
of
the
church
benevolent
offerings
is
used
but
you
do
mean
to
tell
us
said
incredulously
that
you
can
drop
in
on
a
place
like
delafield
make
up
your
mind
what
is
needed
and
then
dump
a
lot
of
money
into
a
church
just
like
that
oh
it
not
so
informal
as
all
that
conover
said
the
thing
has
to
go
through
the
official
channels
of
course
your
district
superintendent
and
brother
drury
and
the
bishop
and
several
others
have
had
a
hand
in
it
already
all
concerned
have
agreed
as
to
the
needs
and
possibilities
but
delafield
is
also
a
good
place
to
put
on
a
demonstration
an
actual
operating
scheme
i
have
been
making
ready
for
a
survey
of
the
whole
east
side
just
a
preliminary
study
and
before
anything
positive
is
done
we
must
make
a
more
thorough
inquiry
we
expect
to
find
out
everything
that
needs
to
be
known
there
was
only
one
anxiety
i
had
about
it
pastor
drury
said
and
that
has
been
all
taken
away
i
was
keen
to
have
this
be
a
truly
christian
demonstration
not
just
a
settlement
or
a
parish
house
or
night
school
classes
but
a
real
demonstration
of
christian
service
among
people
who
now
know
little
about
it
in
some
places
these
activities
are
being
set
going
because
church
people
know
they
ought
to
do
something
and
it
is
easier
to
give
money
and
have
gymnasiums
and
moving
pictures
than
to
make
real
proof
of
partnership
with
christ
by
personal
service
and
sacrifice
take
your
old
friend
martin
luther
shenk
do
you
know
that
he
working
at
this
very
difficulty
and
i
hear
he
finding
even
in
the
country
that
some
people
will
really
give
themselves
while
others
will
give
only
their
money
and
their
time
thought
of
week
and
how
he
had
had
to
drive
himself
to
speak
to
marty
so
he
knew
the
pastor
was
right
and
he
went
home
with
all
sorts
of
questions
running
through
his
mind
but
with
no
very
satisfying
answers
to
make
them
coming
back
in
a
wakeful
night
to
drury
casual
mention
of
marty
the
thought
of
his
chum
set
him
to
wondering
how
that
sturdy
young
itinerant
was
making
it
go
on
the
ellis
and
valencia
circuit
just
as
the
pastor
guessed
it
might
to
wonder
was
to
decide
he
would
take
a
holiday
a
word
or
two
with
his
father
in
the
morning
gave
him
the
excuse
for
what
he
wanted
to
do
then
he
got
valencia
on
the
long
distance
and
the
operator
told
him
she
would
find
the
reverend
shenk
for
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
started
out
that
morning
to
visit
along
the
state
line
highway
as
it
was
part
of
her
business
to
know
at
the
third
try
marty
was
found
and
he
answered
hail
with
a
shout
after
the
first
exchange
of
noisy
greetings
say
marty
dad
asked
me
to
run
down
in
your
part
of
the
world
and
look
at
some
new
barn
furniture
that
been
put
in
around
ellis
ventilators
and
stanchions
and
individual
drinking
cups
for
the
holsteins
not
like
the
way
we
used
to
treat
the
cows
on
our
farm
hey
well
what
do
you
say
if
i
turn
fashionable
for
once
and
come
down
for
the
not
this
week
but
next
no
need
to
ask
marty
a
question
like
that
come
on
down
make
it
friday
and
i
show
you
the
sights
we
got
something
doing
at
the
ellis
church
something
i
want
you
to
see
then
marty
thought
of
a
few
books
that
he
had
left
at
home
and
hello
are
you
listening
well
how
you
like
to
go
out
to
the
farm
before
you
come
down
here
jeanette
has
gathered
a
bundle
of
my
books
and
i
need
wo
you
get
for
me
and
bring
them
along
certainly
would
the
farm
was
home
to
both
the
boys
and
was
almost
as
welcome
there
as
marty
to
one
member
of
the
family
quite
so
though
she
had
never
mentioned
it
on
the
next
sunday
morning
drove
out
of
town
in
time
to
get
to
the
little
old
church
of
his
childhood
for
morning
service
then
he
would
go
home
with
the
shenks
for
dinner
spend
the
afternoon
get
the
books
and
come
home
when
he
was
ready
there
was
no
hurry
had
given
him
two
sundays
leave
of
absence
from
sunday
school
the
next
sunday
would
be
his
and
marty
but
this
would
be
his
and
jeannette
not
that
he
needed
to
make
any
special
plans
for
being
with
jeannette
shenk
of
late
he
had
found
the
half
hour
drive
down
to
the
old
farm
the
prelude
to
a
pleasant
evening
sometimes
he
would
make
the
round
trip
twice
running
out
to
bring
jeanette
into
town
when
something
was
going
on
and
taking
her
home
afterward
in
the
immemorial
fashion
as
turned
to
the
church
yard
lane
leading
up
to
the
old
horseshed
he
noticed
that
there
were
only
two
cars
there
besides
his
own
and
one
sidebar
buggy
battered
and
with
a
decrepit
and
gray
mare
between
the
shafts
it
was
time
for
meeting
and
he
contrasted
emptiness
of
the
long
sheds
with
the
crowding
vehicles
of
his
childhood
memories
in
those
days
so
tightly
were
buggies
and
surries
and
democrats
and
even
spring
wagons
and
an
occasional
sulky
wedged
into
the
space
that
it
was
nothing
unusual
for
the
sermon
to
be
interrupted
by
an
uproar
in
the
sheds
when
some
peevish
horse
attempted
to
set
its
teeth
in
the
neck
of
a
neighbor
with
a
resultant
squealing
and
plunging
a
cramping
of
wheels
and
a
rattle
of
harness
which
could
neutralize
the
most
vociferous
circuit
rider
eloquence
at
the
door
fell
in
with
the
little
group
of
men
who
according
to
ancient
custom
had
waited
in
the
yard
for
the
announcement
of
the
first
hymn
before
ending
their
talk
of
crops
and
roads
and
stock
and
joining
the
women
and
children
within
inside
the
contrast
with
the
older
day
was
even
more
striking
the
church
small
as
it
was
seemed
almost
empty
the
shenks
were
there
including
jeannette
as
promptly
managed
to
observe
father
foltz
and
his
daughter
stood
in
their
accustomed
place
they
had
come
in
the
venerable
sidebar
buggy
just
as
for
two
decades
past
mother
foltz
had
been
out
of
the
house
in
years
and
among
earliest
recollections
were
those
of
the
cottage
prayer
meetings
that
he
had
attended
with
his
father
in
foltz
speckless
sickroom
then
there
were
the
four
newells
and
bellamy
and
and
haggard
with
their
two
little
girls
and
a
few
people
did
not
know
perhaps
altogether
no
wonder
the
preacher
was
disheartened
and
preached
a
flavorless
sermon
where
were
the
boys
and
girls
of
even
a
dozen
years
ago
where
the
children
who
began
their
sunday
school
career
in
the
little
recess
back
of
the
curtain
and
where
the
whole
families
that
once
filled
the
place
surely
old
deep
creek
church
had
fallen
on
evil
days
it
was
a
dismal
service
with
its
dreary
sermon
and
its
tuneless
hymns
after
the
benediction
shook
hands
with
the
preacher
whom
he
knew
slightly
and
exchanged
greetings
with
all
the
old
friends
well
john
wesley
said
father
foltz
with
glum
garrulity
this
the
church
you
used
to
know
when
you
was
little
i
mind
in
them
times
when
you
folks
lived
on
the
farm
how
we
thought
we
have
to
enlarge
the
meetinghouse
but
it
a
good
thing
we
never
done
it
there
room
enough
now
and
the
old
man
indulged
in
a
mirthless
toothless
grimace
the
shenks
did
invite
him
to
dinner
their
understanding
was
finer
than
that
pa
shenk
just
said
let
me
drive
out
first
john
wesley
i
go
on
ahead
and
open
the
gate
and
said
to
jeannette
jump
into
my
car
jean
it
is
fair
to
put
everybody
into
pa
shenk
ford
when
mine
younger
and
nearly
empty
so
that
was
that
all
regular
and
comfortable
and
proper
if
newell
smiled
as
she
watched
them
drive
away
what
of
it
she
was
heard
to
say
to
bellamy
i
known
for
three
years
that
those
two
ought
to
wake
up
and
fall
in
love
with
each
other
and
they
been
slower
than
father
foltz
old
gray
mare
but
it
looks
as
though
they
were
getting
their
eyes
open
at
last
at
the
farm
shenk
hurried
to
finish
up
the
dinner
preparations
with
jeannette
to
help
ben
and
little
alice
contended
for
favor
until
he
took
alice
on
his
knee
and
put
one
arm
about
her
and
the
other
about
her
brother
standing
by
the
chair
and
pa
shenk
talked
about
the
church
i
reckon
i
should
complain
john
wesley
he
said
seeing
that
our
marty
is
a
country
preacher
and
maybe
he
be
having
to
handle
a
job
like
this
some
time
but
i
ca
believe
he
will
his
letters
do
read
like
it
but
pa
shenk
said
do
you
suppose
the
trouble
here
in
deep
creek
is
because
you
so
near
town
nine
miles
is
nothing
these
days
but
when
you
first
came
to
the
farm
there
was
only
one
automobile
in
the
township
now
everybody
can
go
into
town
to
church
they
can
boy
pa
shenk
answered
but
they
do
not
all
of
some
do
care
enough
to
go
anywhere
tenants
mostly
they
are
some
go
to
town
all
right
enough
but
not
to
church
a
few
go
to
church
i
admit
but
only
a
few
started
to
speak
hesitated
then
blurted
it
out
maybe
dad
and
others
like
him
are
responsible
for
some
of
the
trouble
they
pulled
out
and
left
just
a
few
to
carry
the
load
you
all
right
of
course
you
really
belong
here
but
a
lot
of
the
farmers
who
have
moved
to
town
have
rented
their
places
to
what
you
call
tenants
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
poor
way
to
build
up
anything
in
the
country
churches
or
anything
else
tenants
that
are
always
moving
do
get
to
know
anybody
or
to
count
for
anything
it
not
much
wonder
they
are
no
use
to
the
church
there
a
good
deal
in
that
john
wesley
said
pa
shenk
your
father
and
me
we
get
along
fine
we
more
like
partners
than
owner
and
tenant
but
it
is
so
with
these
renters
the
owner
raises
the
rent
as
the
price
of
land
rises
and
the
tenant
is
mostly
too
poor
to
do
anything
much
after
he
paid
the
rent
besides
he
got
no
stake
in
the
neighborhood
why
should
he
pay
to
help
build
a
new
church
when
he
got
to
move
the
first
of
march
and
the
church
has
been
as
careless
about
him
as
he
has
been
about
the
church
that
what
bothers
me
commented
but
even
so
i
should
think
something
could
be
done
to
interest
these
folks
they
all
got
families
to
bring
up
something
can
be
done
too
said
pa
shenk
you
remember
when
the
people
on
upper
deep
creek
used
to
come
here
to
church
four
miles
or
so
well
now
they
are
going
to
fairfield
church
owners
renters
everybody
it
surprising
how
fairfield
church
is
growing
that
going
away
from
town
not
to
it
and
they
as
near
to
town
as
we
are
then
persisted
how
do
you
account
for
it
only
one
way
my
boy
said
pa
shenk
i
as
much
to
blame
as
any
but
we
had
some
preachers
here
that
did
seem
to
understand
and
then
lately
we
had
preachers
who
stayed
in
town
all
the
time
except
on
preaching
sunday
and
we
scarcely
saw
or
heard
of
all
the
two
weeks
between
they
have
held
protracted
meetings
for
several
years
and
i
ai
blaming
what
the
use
of
holding
meetings
when
you
know
nobody
coming
except
people
that
were
converted
before
our
present
pastor
was
born
you
say
some
people
are
going
over
to
fairfield
asked
why
do
they
go
there
when
they
could
go
to
town
about
as
easy
well
john
wesley
pa
shenk
answered
soberly
i
think
i
know
but
you
say
you
going
to
spend
next
sunday
with
marty
from
what
marty
writes
i
a
notion
it
much
the
same
on
his
work
as
it
is
at
fairfield
except
that
marty
has
two
points
wait
till
next
week
and
then
come
back
and
tell
us
how
you
explain
the
difference
between
deep
creek
church
and
ellis
in
the
afternoon
jeannette
and
took
a
ride
around
the
neighborhood
whose
every
tree
and
culvert
and
rural
they
knew
without
in
the
least
being
tired
of
seeing
it
their
talk
was
on
an
old
old
subject
and
not
remarkable
yet
somehow
it
was
more
to
them
both
than
any
poet
rhapsody
and
their
occasional
silences
were
no
less
eloquent
but
in
a
more
than
usually
prosaic
moment
jeannette
said
john
wesley
i
wonder
if
there
any
hope
to
get
the
deep
creek
young
people
interested
in
church
the
way
they
used
to
be
i
just
hungry
for
the
sort
of
good
times
the
older
boys
and
girls
used
to
have
when
you
and
marty
and
i
were
nothing
but
children
they
enjoyed
themselves
and
so
did
everybody
else
what
the
matter
with
so
many
country
churches
nowadays
to
which
question
could
only
answer
i
do
know
i
realize
things
were
so
bad
here
maybe
i
get
some
ideas
about
it
next
saturday
and
sunday
your
father
seems
to
think
marty
is
getting
started
on
the
right
track
and
that
reminds
me
do
let
me
go
away
without
those
books
he
wants
will
you
this
is
not
a
record
of
that
sunday
afternoon
drive
nor
of
the
many
others
which
followed
on
other
sundays
and
on
the
days
between
some
other
time
there
may
be
opportunity
for
the
whole
story
of
jeannette
and
as
drove
up
to
ellis
corners
post
office
late
the
next
friday
afternoon
marty
waylaid
him
and
demanded
to
be
taken
aboard
drive
a
further
east
he
said
after
their
boisterous
greetings
that
where
we
eat
at
ambery
then
just
across
the
road
to
the
church
we
got
something
special
on
a
box
supper
asked
or
a
party
but
he
knew
better
marty
told
him
to
wait
and
see
supper
was
a
pleasant
meal
the
amberys
being
pleasant
people
who
lived
in
a
cozy
new
house
but
was
mystified
to
hear
marty
speak
of
henry
ambery
as
a
retired
farmer
he
knew
retired
farmers
in
town
plenty
of
them
and
some
no
happier
for
being
there
but
in
the
country
oh
said
marty
that
easy
our
church
is
the
social
hub
of
all
this
community
and
i
told
the
amberys
that
if
they
built
here
they
would
be
as
well
off
as
in
town
i
right
too
they
bought
two
acres
for
less
than
the
price
of
a
town
lot
and
they
have
most
of
the
farm
comforts
as
well
as
all
the
modern
conveniences
you
did
notice
any
signs
of
homesickness
did
you
no
had
though
he
knew
the
sort
of
homesickness
when
he
saw
it
and
the
amberys
are
worth
more
to
the
church
than
they
ever
were
marty
added
i
thinking
of
a
scheme
to
colonize
two
or
three
other
retiring
farmers
within
easy
reach
of
this
church
why
not
they
got
cars
and
can
drive
to
the
county
seat
in
an
hour
if
they
want
to
that
better
than
living
there
all
the
time
with
nothing
to
do
by
this
the
two
were
at
the
church
a
pretty
frame
building
with
a
community
house
adjoining
the
auditorium
people
were
beginning
to
arrive
in
all
sorts
of
vehicles
cars
mostly
looked
for
signs
of
a
feed
but
vainly
no
spread
tables
no
smell
of
cooking
or
rattle
of
dishes
from
the
kitchen
what
is
it
marty
he
asked
and
marty
laughed
as
he
answered
singing
school
with
some
variations
that
all
certainly
it
was
something
which
interested
the
countryside
for
there
was
every
indication
of
a
crowded
house
heard
the
singing
and
noted
with
high
approval
the
variations
which
modernized
the
old
order
he
thought
the
idea
plenty
good
enough
even
for
delafield
which
for
him
left
nothing
more
to
be
said
and
there
a
feed
after
all
but
it
was
distinctly
light
refreshments
such
as
was
used
to
at
delafield
first
church
on
the
way
back
to
the
amberys
and
well
into
the
night
in
room
they
talked
about
the
circuit
and
its
work
it
is
a
circuit
rightly
you
know
marty
said
i
preach
every
sunday
at
both
places
and
for
the
present
grinned
i
can
get
across
the
whole
parish
every
day
if
necessary
but
i
working
it
a
little
more
systematically
than
that
you
must
be
i
can
hardly
believe
even
what
i
seen
already
replied
when
i
was
at
deep
creek
last
sunday
i
was
sure
it
was
all
off
with
the
country
church
and
on
the
way
down
here
i
passed
three
abandoned
meetinghouses
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
persuade
you
out
of
it
you
know
i
was
much
in
favor
of
your
coming
here
in
the
first
place
but
maybe
that
a
bigger
job
than
i
thought
you
right
john
wesley
about
that
i
do
budge
if
i
can
make
myself
big
enough
for
the
job
it
too
interesting
and
things
are
happening
there
no
danger
of
this
church
being
abandoned
but
what
do
you
do
marty
to
make
things
happen
i
know
they
just
happen
i
from
the
country
too
remember
that
what
do
i
do
not
but
well
we
work
with
our
heads
first
and
our
hearts
then
we
get
out
and
go
at
it
take
our
very
first
social
difficulty
in
delafield
you
have
a
dozen
places
to
go
to
here
either
the
church
or
the
schoolhouse
that
all
the
choice
there
is
and
the
schoolhouse
has
its
limitations
so
our
folks
have
decided
to
make
the
church
both
here
and
at
valencia
the
center
of
the
community
that
explains
the
social
hall
we
call
it
house
everything
that
goes
on
except
the
barn
dances
over
east
that
we
ca
do
much
with
so
far
goes
on
in
the
church
or
starts
with
the
church
or
ends
at
the
church
that
the
first
scheme
we
put
over
it
was
fairly
easy
you
know
because
all
our
country
people
are
pretty
much
one
lot
we
have
no
rich
and
no
really
poor
and
they
not
organized
to
death
either
as
you
are
in
delafield
do
you
try
to
have
something
going
on
every
night
and
nearly
every
day
as
brother
drury
does
with
us
asked
not
quite
replied
marty
we
ca
we
too
busy
growing
the
food
for
you
town
folks
but
we
keep
up
a
pretty
stiff
pace
for
the
preacher
i
have
no
time
hanging
on
my
hands
i
should
think
not
commented
if
you
try
to
run
everything
drury
always
seems
to
have
lots
of
time
just
because
he
makes
the
rest
of
us
run
the
works
in
delafield
first
oh
he
does
does
he
said
marty
shortly
who
knew
something
of
the
older
minister
strategy
that
according
to
how
you
look
at
it
not
above
learning
from
him
and
i
do
run
everything
either
but
there
or
thereabouts
most
of
the
time
how
do
you
get
time
for
your
study
and
your
sermons
then
queried
if
you
on
the
go
so
much
marty
turned
a
quizzical
look
at
my
beloved
chum
how
did
you
and
i
get
time
for
our
studies
at
cartwright
he
said
besides
i
making
one
hand
wash
the
other
the
social
life
here
for
instance
used
to
be
pretty
bad
before
henderson
came
that
the
preacher
whose
place
i
took
it
was
pulling
away
from
the
church
now
it
draws
to
the
church
henderson
started
that
the
people
who
are
my
main
dependence
in
the
other
affairs
are
mostly
the
same
people
i
can
count
on
in
the
sunday
school
and
league
and
the
preaching
service
the
more
we
do
the
better
it
is
for
what
we
do
sundays
then
there
another
because
these
people
and
i
know
one
another
so
well
i
could
put
on
airs
in
the
pulpit
if
i
wanted
to
i
just
got
to
preach
straight
and
i
wo
preach
a
thing
i
ca
back
up
myself
i
use
country
illustrations
show
them
their
own
world
it
one
big
white
mark
for
the
farwell
farm
as
you
might
suppose
that
i
know
the
best
side
of
country
life
though
i
do
advertise
your
real
estate
i
know
said
but
do
you
find
country
people
pretty
hard
to
manage
that
our
experience
at
the
store
they
are
particular
and
critical
and
think
they
know
just
what
they
want
they
do
too
marty
asserted
why
should
they
i
believe
i
can
tell
you
one
big
difference
between
the
city
boy
and
the
country
you
been
both
see
if
i
right
the
country
boy
minds
his
folks
and
his
teacher
but
everything
else
minds
him
he
is
boss
of
every
critter
on
the
place
from
the
hens
to
the
horses
whenever
he
has
anything
to
do
with
them
at
all
so
he
learns
to
think
for
them
as
well
as
for
himself
in
the
city
the
boy
has
no
chance
to
give
orders
he
under
orders
all
the
time
the
traffic
cop
the
truant
officer
the
boss
in
the
shop
or
the
office
the
street
car
conductor
the
janitor
everybody
bosses
him
and
he
bosses
nothing
except
his
kid
brothers
and
sisters
so
he
may
come
to
be
half
cringer
and
half
bully
the
country
boy
is
not
likely
to
be
much
afraid
and
he
soon
learns
that
if
he
tries
to
boss
even
the
boys
without
good
reason
it
does
pay
maybe
that
the
reason
so
many
country
boys
make
good
when
they
go
to
the
city
and
the
reason
why
a
city
boy
like
me
suggested
would
be
a
misfit
in
the
country
oh
you
scoffed
marty
you
do
count
you
a
but
as
i
meant
to
say
you
right
about
country
folks
they
are
a
little
close
maybe
they
are
more
independent
in
their
business
than
town
people
but
they
learn
how
to
work
together
they
exchange
farm
work
and
work
the
roads
and
they
are
fairly
dependent
on
one
another
for
all
social
life
on
deep
creek
the
tenant
farmers
are
the
biggest
difficulty
your
dad
told
me
last
sunday
said
they
go
to
town
when
they
go
anywhere
and
not
to
church
either
i
know
said
marty
and
i
do
much
blame
from
all
i
hear
but
henderson
changed
that
considerably
in
this
community
he
found
out
that
the
tenants
were
just
as
human
as
the
others
only
they
had
the
idea
that
nobody
cared
about
them
because
they
might
be
here
and
gone
and
what
do
you
think
i
find
tenant
farmers
around
here
are
beginning
to
take
longer
leases
one
or
two
are
about
like
dad
been
with
your
father
more
partners
than
anything
else
every
renter
family
in
this
neighborhood
comes
to
our
church
and
only
three
or
four
fight
shy
of
us
at
valencia
all
right
said
drowsily
go
to
sleep
now
i
got
to
inspect
that
holstein
hotel
in
the
morning
and
i
know
what
country
hours
are
the
next
day
drove
off
toward
the
big
barns
of
his
customer
and
left
marty
deep
in
the
mysteries
of
sunday
sermon
marty
was
yet
a
very
young
preacher
and
one
sermon
a
week
was
all
he
could
manage
as
several
of
his
admirers
had
found
out
to
his
discomfiture
when
one
sunday
they
followed
him
from
ellis
in
the
morning
to
valencia
at
night
but
the
twicers
professed
to
enjoy
it
farmer
was
quite
ready
to
talk
about
the
new
barn
equipment
and
how
it
was
working
and
he
had
remarkably
few
complaints
these
more
for
form
sake
than
anything
else
that
business
was
soon
out
of
the
way
but
farmer
bellamy
was
interested
in
other
things
besides
ventilators
and
so
you
a
friend
of
our
preacher
he
said
in
the
questioning
affirmative
of
the
deliberate
country
well
he
quite
a
young
fellow
you
never
get
up
early
enough
to
find
him
working
in
a
cold
collar
maybe
he
a
mite
ambitious
but
i
do
know
as
always
came
promptly
to
marty
defense
he
not
ambitious
for
himself
bellamy
i
vouch
for
that
but
i
should
wonder
he
is
ambitious
about
his
work
and
maybe
that
not
a
bad
thing
for
a
country
preacher
in
these
days
that
so
bellamy
assented
but
i
doubt
we
keep
him
he
be
getting
a
church
in
town
before
long
now
had
no
instructions
from
marty
but
he
thought
he
might
venture
and
he
had
been
introduced
to
a
few
ideas
that
he
had
never
met
in
the
days
when
he
objected
to
marty
taking
a
country
circuit
i
tell
you
something
bellamy
he
said
marty
is
a
boy
who
loves
the
country
if
he
has
the
right
sort
of
backing
i
should
wonder
he
stayed
here
a
good
long
time
he
got
enough
plans
ahead
for
this
circuit
of
his
bellamy
laughed
he
has
that
if
he
waits
to
get
all
going
we
sure
of
him
for
a
while
why
he
wants
to
make
the
church
the
most
important
business
in
the
whole
neighborhood
and
what
more
getting
some
of
us
to
see
it
that
way
too
yes
i
guess
that
his
dream
said
and
it
so
much
better
than
the
reality
up
around
where
i
used
to
live
that
i
would
head
him
off
if
i
were
you
head
him
off
bellamy
laughed
again
why
do
you
know
what
he
did
in
the
fall
when
some
of
us
told
him
we
could
do
much
for
missions
he
phoned
all
over
the
neighborhood
the
day
before
he
set
out
with
a
truck
he
had
hired
for
the
job
told
us
to
put
into
the
truck
anything
we
could
spare
and
what
do
you
think
before
night
he
drove
into
hill
city
with
a
big
overload
even
for
that
truck
of
wheat
corn
butter
eggs
chickens
sausage
apples
potatoes
and
dear
knows
what
sold
the
lot
for
dollars
he
paid
nine
dollars
for
the
truck
got
a
rate
on
it
and
turned
in
for
missions
sixty
dollars
never
given
more
than
twenty
in
cash
but
that
was
all
next
sunday
he
reported
and
before
any
of
us
could
say
the
lord
says
he
think
the
lord
giving
any
of
us
much
credit
for
that
stuff
we
owe
him
a
good
deal
more
than
a
few
eggs
that
we
never
miss
i
just
wanted
to
show
you
that
when
we
country
people
really
start
paying
our
tithe
to
the
almighty
our
missionary
and
other
offerings
will
make
that
truckload
look
like
the
crumbs
from
our
tables
i
proved
that
we
rich
instead
of
being
too
poor
to
provide
for
missions
and
it
all
our
father
you
know
when
we
pay
him
our
tithe
we
admit
that
in
the
only
practical
way
funny
thing
was
the
whole
business
had
been
so
queer
nobody
got
mad
over
his
plain
talk
some
of
us
have
begun
to
tithe
and
to
enjoy
it
yes
that
young
feller
is
quite
a
young
feller
rather
admired
the
tale
of
the
truck
it
was
like
marty
right
enough
to
get
his
tithing
talk
illustrated
with
a
load
of
produce
but
there
was
more
than
a
hint
of
a
new
marty
with
a
new
directness
and
confidence
so
he
asked
what
else
is
he
doing
that
making
a
difference
and
the
floodgates
were
lifted
the
bellamy
gift
of
utterance
had
a
congenial
theme
for
an
hour
the
stream
ran
strong
and
steady
and
when
it
would
have
stopped
none
could
tell
but
remembered
he
had
promised
to
be
back
with
marty
for
dinner
and
so
in
the
midst
of
a
story
about
marty
saturday
afternoon
outings
with
the
boys
highly
reminiscent
of
their
own
saturdays
in
the
deep
creek
timber
made
his
excuses
and
hurried
away
in
that
hour
he
had
heard
of
the
observing
of
special
days
thanksgiving
and
christmas
particularly
of
the
rage
for
athletic
equipment
on
every
farm
which
had
youngsters
so
that
the
usual
anaemic
croquet
outfit
had
given
place
to
basketball
practice
sets
ball
nets
and
other
paraphernalia
some
of
it
not
much
used
now
since
winter
had
come
but
under
marty
leadership
a
skating
rink
construction
gang
had
thrown
up
a
dirt
embankment
in
a
low
spot
near
the
creek
and
then
cut
a
channel
far
enough
upstream
to
flood
about
four
acres
of
swamp
bellamy
told
about
the
skating
tournaments
every
afternoon
of
the
cold
weather
for
the
school
children
and
saturday
afternoons
for
the
older
young
folks
more
people
went
than
skated
too
the
garrulous
farmer
asserted
it
was
just
another
of
that
young
preacher
sociability
schemes
and
there
was
no
end
to
seemed
like
to
him
there
was
even
more
on
the
business
side
of
country
life
how
marty
had
joined
forces
with
the
grange
and
the
county
agent
and
the
cooperators
of
the
creamery
and
the
elevator
and
the
school
teachers
and
so
on
and
so
on
would
be
the
last
to
worry
about
such
a
program
it
just
fitted
his
ideas
but
it
made
him
a
little
more
interested
in
the
sunday
services
would
marty
preaching
match
his
community
work
but
before
sunday
morning
came
had
other
questions
to
ask
he
put
them
to
marty
in
intervals
of
the
skating
races
and
again
after
supper
before
going
over
to
the
church
to
meet
a
little
group
of
folk
my
marty
called
them
who
were
learning
with
him
how
to
adapt
sunday
school
science
and
the
teaching
art
to
the
conditions
of
the
open
country
all
of
questions
were
really
one
big
question
say
marty
boy
i
always
knew
you
had
something
in
you
that
did
show
on
the
surface
but
i
never
thought
it
was
exactly
the
stuff
they
need
to
make
country
preachers
how
does
it
happen
that
you
blossomed
out
in
these
few
months
as
a
moses
to
lead
a
parish
if
the
right
scientific
name
out
of
such
a
wilderness
as
i
saw
at
deep
creek
last
sunday
marty
made
a
pass
at
his
chum
in
the
fashion
of
the
cartwright
days
and
waited
for
the
return
punch
before
answering
do
you
me
john
wesley
besides
this
circuit
was
no
wilderness
henderson
the
preacher
who
was
here
before
me
was
just
the
man
for
this
work
he
knew
the
country
and
believed
it
had
the
makings
of
even
more
attractive
life
than
the
town
too
bad
he
had
to
quit
but
he
started
these
folks
thinking
the
right
way
and
then
do
you
remember
i
wrote
last
summer
that
i
was
spending
two
weeks
at
a
school
for
rural
ministers
oh
yes
i
remember
that
answered
but
that
no
explanation
i
spent
four
years
at
a
college
for
town
and
country
boys
and
now
look
at
me
two
weeks
is
a
little
too
short
a
course
to
produce
miracles
even
with
such
an
intellect
as
yours
notwithstanding
your
name
is
bigger
than
mine
martin
luther
now
if
you
said
four
weeks
i
might
almost
have
believed
you
but
two
weeks
well
it
just
is
done
that
all
make
fun
of
it
will
you
said
marty
with
another
jab
now
listen
to
me
that
thing
is
simple
enough
first
off
i
been
thinking
four
years
about
being
a
preacher
on
top
of
that
i
been
a
country
boy
for
years
i
know
the
deep
creek
neighborhood
better
than
you
do
because
i
had
to
live
there
you
were
just
visiting
the
farm
your
father
paid
taxes
on
when
i
came
here
i
found
that
henderson
had
set
things
going
he
told
me
what
his
dream
was
so
when
i
went
to
that
school
i
was
ready
to
take
in
every
word
and
see
every
picture
and
get
a
grip
on
every
principle
maybe
you
know
that
it
was
one
of
many
such
schools
set
up
by
the
rural
work
leaders
of
our
home
missions
board
and
it
was
a
great
school
they
had
no
use
for
ruralists
so
the
faculty
instead
of
being
made
up
of
paper
experts
was
a
bunch
of
men
who
it
was
worth
a
year
of
dawdling
over
you
see
i
knew
i
could
come
back
here
and
try
everything
on
my
own
people
it
was
like
the
squeers
school
in
nickleby
when
the
spelling
class
was
up
squeers
says
to
smike
the
big
helpless
dunce
window
and
smike
says
right
squeers
says
go
out
and
wash
well
i
hope
i
got
the
spelling
a
little
nearer
right
but
i
came
home
and
began
washing
my
windows
that
all
said
huh
and
that
stood
for
understanding
and
approval
and
confidence
as
to
marty
preaching
it
was
a
boy
preaching
naturally
but
it
was
preaching
and
the
people
came
for
it
remarked
to
himself
the
contrast
between
the
cars
around
ellis
church
and
the
forlornly
vacant
he
had
seen
at
deep
creek
the
sunday
before
the
hearty
singing
of
people
glad
to
be
singing
together
the
contagious
interest
of
a
house
and
the
simple
directness
of
the
preacher
were
all
of
a
piece
here
was
no
effort
to
ape
the
forms
of
a
cathedral
but
neither
was
there
any
careless
cheap
slovenliness
and
assuredly
there
were
no
religious
stunts
marty
preached
the
christian
evangel
not
moralized
agriculture
he
made
the
gospel
invitation
a
social
appeal
without
blinking
its
primary
message
to
the
individual
to
place
himself
under
the
authority
of
christ
love
he
put
first
things
in
front
him
that
cometh
unto
me
and
then
with
simple
illustrations
and
words
as
simple
he
showed
that
they
who
had
accepted
christ
lordship
were
honor
bound
to
live
together
under
a
new
sort
of
law
from
that
of
the
restless
pushing
world
it
shall
not
be
so
among
you
besides
he
told
them
they
could
not
separate
service
from
profit
they
knew
for
instance
that
their
farm
values
were
a
third
higher
because
of
the
presence
of
the
church
and
its
work
but
they
would
find
that
the
profit
motive
was
not
big
enough
to
keep
the
church
going
they
had
to
love
the
work
and
do
it
for
love
of
it
that
afternoon
the
friends
drove
over
to
valencia
where
at
night
marty
would
preach
again
this
his
one
sermon
of
the
week
and
left
him
there
turning
his
car
homeward
for
the
miles
to
delafield
as
they
parted
gripped
marty
hand
and
said
old
man
i
own
up
i
thought
you
ought
not
to
bury
yourself
in
the
country
but
i
had
no
need
to
worry
i
know
preachers
who
are
buried
in
town
all
right
you
have
a
bigger
field
and
a
livelier
one
than
they
will
ever
find
and
i
never
say
another
word
about
your
school
if
the
home
missions
board
had
nothing
else
to
do
such
work
as
it
showed
you
how
to
do
would
be
worth
all
the
board
costs
i
going
to
make
trouble
for
drury
and
the
district
superintendent
and
the
bishop
and
the
board
and
anybody
else
i
can
get
hold
of
until
deep
creek
gets
the
same
sort
of
chance
as
this
circuit
of
yours
if
only
they
knew
where
to
find
another
martin
luther
shenk
that
the
rub
and
with
a
last
handclasp
the
chums
went
their
separate
ways
on
monday
called
up
pastor
drury
and
gave
that
gentleman
who
was
expecting
it
a
summary
of
his
day
with
marty
i
awfully
glad
i
happened
to
think
of
going
over
there
he
said
not
only
for
the
sake
of
being
with
the
old
boy
again
but
because
i
got
some
new
notions
about
the
country
church
and
about
what
we
methodists
are
beginning
to
do
for
the
places
where
methodism
got
its
start
and
walter
drury
said
yes
i
glad
too
so
he
was
he
could
put
down
a
new
mark
on
the
credit
side
of
the
experiment
chapter
vi
is
he
not
a
man
and
a
brother
the
colored
methodists
of
delafield
who
called
their
church
saint
marks
had
always
been
on
good
terms
with
their
white
drury
and
the
pastor
of
saint
marks
found
many
occasions
of
helping
each
other
in
their
work
the
single
way
in
which
these
two
showed
themselves
conscious
of
the
color
line
was
that
while
the
pastor
of
first
church
often
preached
in
saint
marks
when
the
pastor
of
saint
marks
appeared
in
the
pulpit
of
first
church
it
was
to
speak
on
some
aspect
of
his
work
knew
saint
marks
of
old
in
his
days
that
church
had
for
its
preacher
one
of
a
race
a
man
mighty
in
exhortation
even
though
narrowly
circumscribed
in
scholastic
equipment
his
preaching
was
redolent
of
the
camp
meeting
and
he
counted
that
sermon
lost
which
did
not
evoke
a
shout
or
two
from
the
front
benches
a
few
of
first
church
younger
people
often
went
to
sing
at
saint
marks
on
special
occasions
and
went
all
the
more
cheerfully
because
of
the
chance
it
afforded
to
hear
brother
king
officer
preach
where
he
got
that
name
is
not
known
but
he
had
no
other
do
not
think
the
young
people
either
went
to
scoff
or
remained
to
pray
if
at
times
they
were
amused
at
brother
officer
peculiarities
so
were
some
members
of
his
own
flock
and
brother
officer
was
wise
enough
to
assume
that
no
disrespect
was
intended
and
if
the
white
visitors
treated
his
fervent
appeals
to
the
unconverted
and
backsliders
as
part
of
the
program
but
having
no
slightest
application
to
them
this
was
also
the
regular
thing
and
nobody
was
troubled
thereat
but
while
was
away
at
college
a
new
pastor
had
come
to
saint
marks
a
college
and
seminary
graduate
and
he
had
come
just
in
time
brother
officer
was
getting
old
but
the
determining
factor
which
made
the
change
necessary
was
that
delafield
happened
to
be
near
one
of
the
general
routes
by
which
thousands
of
colored
people
were
moving
northward
exoduses
have
been
before
kansas
still
remembers
the
exodus
from
tennessee
of
forty
years
ago
but
this
latest
exodus
had
no
one
nor
any
single
destination
it
was
a
vast
shifting
of
negro
populations
from
below
mason
and
dixon
line
and
it
swept
northward
toward
all
the
great
industrial
centers
its
cause
and
consequences
make
a
remarkable
story
for
which
there
is
no
room
in
this
chronicle
delafield
thought
it
could
not
absorb
many
more
negroes
but
before
the
exodus
movement
subsided
the
stragglers
who
had
turned
aside
at
delafield
had
more
than
doubled
the
negro
population
of
the
town
a
heavy
burden
of
new
responsibility
was
on
the
young
pastor
of
saint
marks
the
newcomers
had
no
such
alertness
and
resourcefulness
as
his
own
people
they
were
helpless
in
the
face
of
new
experiences
soon
they
became
a
worry
and
an
enigma
to
the
town
authorities
but
especially
and
inevitably
they
turned
to
the
churches
of
their
own
color
of
which
delafield
could
boast
but
two
a
methodist
and
a
baptist
so
saint
marks
and
its
pastor
found
both
new
opportunity
and
new
troubles
one
day
in
the
early
spring
drury
dropped
in
to
the
farwell
store
and
asked
if
he
would
be
busy
that
night
the
road
to
deep
creek
was
at
its
spring
worst
and
had
nothing
special
on
he
said
as
much
and
answering
his
look
of
inquiry
the
pastor
said
there
a
man
speaking
at
saint
marks
who
a
yale
graduate
and
a
negro
also
a
methodist
does
the
combination
interest
you
why
yes
answered
it
might
you
know
i
used
to
go
with
the
bunch
to
saint
marks
when
brother
officer
was
pastor
but
i
have
been
since
he
left
i
like
to
see
what
the
new
preacher
is
doing
and
it
ought
to
be
worth
something
to
hear
a
negro
alumnus
of
yale
william
hightower
it
seemed
was
the
speaker
name
a
confident
man
in
his
thirties
as
soon
discovered
hightower
was
a
distinctively
modern
negro
where
king
officer
had
been
almost
cringing
hightower
thought
however
diplomatically
spoken
was
that
of
an
mind
where
officer
accepted
as
part
of
the
social
order
the
colored
man
dependence
on
the
white
hightower
spoke
of
something
he
called
racial
solidarity
it
was
plain
that
he
meant
his
negro
hearers
to
make
much
of
the
negro
capacity
for
there
was
little
bitterness
and
no
radicalism
in
the
speech
but
to
it
had
a
queer
new
note
he
said
as
much
to
drury
on
the
way
home
why
that
hightower
hardly
ever
mentioned
the
church
although
he
was
speaking
at
a
church
meeting
and
how
independent
he
was
so
you
noticed
that
did
you
the
pastor
responded
to
me
it
is
one
of
the
signs
of
a
new
day
but
do
you
think
it
is
a
good
day
mr
drury
queried
yes
perhaps
i
do
know
anyhow
it
is
new
and
some
of
the
blame
for
it
is
on
our
shoulders
the
way
the
negro
thinks
and
feels
is
a
striking
proof
of
the
fact
often
forgotten
that
when
you
settle
old
questions
you
raise
new
ones
maybe
said
doubtfully
but
i
did
know
we
had
settled
the
negro
question
nor
i
agreed
drury
what
we
i
mean
we
methodists
settled
when
we
began
to
deal
with
the
negro
right
after
emancipation
was
not
the
race
question
it
was
not
even
a
missionary
question
in
the
old
sense
but
it
was
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
education
we
should
give
the
young
colored
people
for
we
set
out
deliberately
to
give
them
schooling
first
with
evangelism
as
an
accompaniment
the
stress
was
on
education
and
we
decided
at
the
outset
on
a
certain
sort
of
education
i
should
think
ventured
that
any
old
sort
of
education
would
serve
the
first
teachers
had
to
begin
at
the
bottom
did
they
yes
and
lower
than
any
beginnings
you
know
anything
about
the
pastor
replied
our
first
workers
began
without
equipment
without
encouragement
and
without
everything
else
except
a
great
pity
for
the
freedman
did
you
notice
by
the
way
that
the
speaker
never
said
or
mentioned
slavery
it
is
a
new
day
i
tell
you
i
wish
you
explain
just
what
you
mean
by
that
drury
said
i
do
seem
to
get
it
i
mean
said
drury
that
as
soon
as
our
church
had
decided
to
do
something
for
the
emancipated
slaves
it
began
to
work
out
a
scheme
of
negro
education
that
was
before
tuskegee
and
even
before
hampton
institute
maybe
we
never
thought
of
the
booker
washington
idea
or
purely
industrial
education
but
at
any
rate
we
went
on
the
theory
that
the
negro
deserved
and
in
time
could
take
as
good
an
education
as
any
other
american
so
we
started
academies
and
colleges
and
even
universities
for
him
and
a
medical
school
and
a
theological
seminary
i
can
see
myself
that
there
a
difference
between
that
and
the
industrial
idea
said
decidedly
there
is
answered
the
minister
all
the
difference
which
has
helped
to
bring
this
new
day
i
talking
about
and
to
produce
such
negro
leaders
as
william
hightower
you
see
it
this
way
booker
washington
believed
that
after
the
negro
had
been
taught
to
read
and
write
and
cipher
his
next
and
greatest
educational
need
was
to
learn
to
make
a
living
well
what
the
matter
with
that
retorted
seems
to
me
common
sense
possibly
drury
answered
dryly
but
what
would
you
say
was
the
first
thing
needed
in
the
fight
against
the
almost
total
illiteracy
of
the
freedmen
why
teachers
i
suppose
said
and
it
would
sure
take
a
lot
of
teachers
even
to
make
a
start
drury
said
that
exactly
the
fact
it
has
called
for
so
many
that
to
this
day
there
is
anything
like
enough
teachers
although
some
of
our
schools
and
those
of
other
churches
have
been
at
work
for
fifty
years
and
remember
that
practically
all
of
these
teachers
except
in
a
few
advanced
schools
must
be
black
teachers
themselves
brought
up
out
of
ignorance
well
said
that
my
point
the
quicker
we
could
teach
the
teachers
the
sooner
they
would
be
ready
to
teach
others
that
is
to
say
drury
interpreted
the
less
we
taught
them
the
better
seems
to
me
i
heard
something
of
a
small
revolt
in
your
time
at
cartwright
because
it
seemed
necessary
that
a
young
tutor
should
be
temporarily
assigned
to
the
class
in
sophomore
english
chuckled
it
was
my
class
why
that
fellow
was
never
more
than
two
jumps
ahead
of
the
daily
work
we
knew
he
had
to
study
his
own
lesson
assignments
before
he
could
hear
a
recitation
we
getting
anything
out
of
it
except
the
bare
text
so
some
of
the
boys
made
things
lively
for
a
few
days
and
he
asked
to
be
relieved
quite
so
your
class
had
every
imaginable
advantage
over
the
colored
boys
and
girls
in
our
schools
just
one
teacher
below
par
and
yet
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
to
have
all
colored
teachers
no
more
than
two
jumps
ahead
of
their
pupils
well
yes
i
see
said
with
a
touch
of
thoughtfulness
i
suppose
a
good
teacher
needs
more
than
the
minimum
knowledge
is
that
the
methodist
theory
now
you
talking
like
yourself
drury
told
him
yes
that
the
methodist
theory
for
the
fifty
years
of
the
old
freedmen
aid
society
now
the
board
of
education
for
negroes
it
has
run
these
schools
eighteen
of
them
now
with
five
thousand
seven
hundred
and
two
earnest
students
enrolled
on
a
double
theory
the
first
part
of
the
theory
is
that
every
child
black
white
red
or
yellow
ought
to
have
all
the
education
he
can
use
anything
less
than
that
would
be
as
good
as
saying
that
america
cares
to
develop
its
human
resources
only
just
so
far
and
not
to
the
limit
the
other
part
of
the
theory
is
that
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
be
put
off
with
half
an
education
is
a
preacher
or
a
teacher
the
best
is
just
good
enough
for
all
teachers
whether
they
teach
from
a
desk
or
from
a
pulpit
i
guess
that
so
too
said
you
getting
me
interested
now
go
on
and
tell
me
some
more
the
new
pastor
of
saint
marks
told
me
said
drury
irrelevantly
that
they
would
be
wanting
some
new
roofing
for
the
barn
turning
into
a
community
house
i
should
be
surprised
if
you
sold
the
church
a
nice
little
bill
of
goods
and
while
you
are
at
it
you
might
talk
to
the
pastor
driver
his
name
about
this
thing
from
his
side
of
the
road
he
knows
more
than
i
do
said
he
would
and
though
he
would
have
meant
it
in
any
case
the
hint
about
roofing
made
certain
that
elder
driver
would
have
a
call
in
the
morning
from
a
rising
young
hardware
salesman
by
this
time
they
were
at
the
farwell
gate
and
said
goodnight
drury
walked
home
but
before
he
got
ready
for
his
beloved
last
hour
of
the
day
with
its
easy
chair
and
its
cherished
book
he
called
up
his
colored
colleague
and
they
had
a
brief
talk
over
the
now
walter
drury
had
taken
no
one
into
his
confidence
about
the
experiment
nor
did
he
intend
to
he
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
keeping
his
own
counsel
through
the
years
so
elder
driver
could
not
know
the
true
inwardness
of
this
telephone
call
indeed
it
was
so
casual
that
he
did
not
even
think
to
mention
it
to
when
that
alert
roofing
specialist
turned
up
next
morning
i
heard
you
were
going
to
put
new
roofing
on
that
barn
you
are
fixing
up
driver
and
i
thought
i
might
get
your
order
for
the
job
maybe
you
know
that
we
do
a
good
deal
of
that
sort
of
work
and
we
can
give
you
expert
service
the
right
roofing
put
on
to
stay
and
to
stay
put
yes
they
were
thinking
of
that
roof
had
to
because
it
leaked
like
a
market
basket
and
they
needed
the
place
right
now
what
with
the
many
colored
methodists
who
had
come
to
town
and
had
no
home
only
rooms
in
the
little
houses
of
the
colored
settlement
that
had
been
too
small
for
comfort
even
before
the
exodus
but
the
place
would
be
worth
a
lot
to
their
work
when
they
got
it
about
how
much
do
you
think
of
spending
mr
driver
asked
knowing
the
limited
means
of
saint
marks
he
expected
to
supply
the
cheapest
roofing
the
farwell
hardware
company
had
in
stock
but
pastor
driver
had
a
surprise
for
him
why
he
said
we
want
the
best
there
is
that
building
was
a
barn
i
admit
but
it
is
strongly
built
and
we
expect
to
fix
it
pretty
thoroughly
we
have
a
gift
from
the
board
of
home
missions
and
church
extension
and
we
match
that
with
as
much
again
of
our
own
money
enough
in
all
to
swing
the
building
around
off
the
alley
put
it
on
a
new
foundation
next
to
the
church
and
remodel
it
for
our
needs
that
news
to
me
said
though
of
course
i
glad
to
hear
it
but
i
did
know
that
the
board
put
money
into
such
work
as
this
somehow
i
supposed
you
were
under
the
board
of
education
for
negroes
no
not
for
this
sort
of
church
work
the
colored
pastor
answered
i
was
the
board
of
education
for
negroes
as
you
put
it
for
a
long
time
myself
in
the
days
when
it
was
called
the
freedmen
aid
society
and
so
was
my
wife
but
now
we
doing
missionary
work
and
that
the
other
board
job
oh
yes
assented
i
might
have
known
that
and
you
mean
that
you
were
under
the
freedmen
aid
society
when
you
were
going
to
school
is
that
it
that
it
said
pastor
driver
with
a
gleaming
smile
i
was
in
two
of
the
schools
philander
smith
college
at
little
rock
arkansas
and
clark
university
at
atlanta
georgia
then
i
got
my
theological
course
at
gammon
on
the
same
campus
as
clark
you
say
your
wife
was
in
school
too
yes
with
an
even
brighter
smile
she
was
at
clark
when
i
met
her
like
me
she
attended
two
schools
on
that
campus
the
other
was
thayer
home
a
girls
dormitory
supported
by
the
woman
home
missionary
society
a
home
then
how
could
it
be
a
school
asked
that
just
it
farwell
the
minister
explained
it
was
a
school
of
home
life
not
only
cooking
and
sewing
and
scrubbing
and
what
all
you
think
of
as
domestic
science
but
a
school
of
the
home
spirit
just
the
thing
my
people
need
thayer
was
and
is
a
place
where
the
girl
students
of
clark
university
learn
how
to
make
real
homes
and
in
the
college
classes
they
learn
what
you
might
suppose
any
college
student
would
learn
that
why
i
said
driver
went
to
two
schools
recalled
the
hightower
speech
of
the
night
before
and
the
discussion
with
drury
on
the
way
home
he
wanted
to
go
into
it
all
with
this
pastor
who
was
much
past
his
own
age
and
evidently
had
some
ideas
for
the
first
time
he
wondered
too
how
it
happened
that
in
that
draft
of
the
everyday
doctrines
of
delafield
they
had
altogether
ignored
the
negro
was
that
a
symptom
of
something
then
he
remembered
his
errand
and
the
work
which
was
waiting
up
at
the
store
so
he
said
excuse
me
driver
for
being
so
inquisitive
i
never
thought
much
about
our
church
colored
work
but
what
i
heard
at
last
night
meeting
started
me
rather
curious
that
i
should
be
here
talking
about
it
with
you
the
very
next
morning
is
it
but
about
that
roofing
now
of
course
you
look
around
and
get
other
estimates
but
anyway
i
be
glad
to
take
the
measurements
and
give
you
our
figures
i
promise
you
they
be
worth
considering
i
sure
of
that
farwell
said
the
other
heartily
and
if
i
have
any
influence
with
the
committee
and
i
think
i
have
you
lose
any
sleep
over
any
other
figures
we
might
get
as
for
being
inquisitive
about
our
work
here
i
wish
more
of
this
town
white
methodists
would
get
inquisitive
and
that
reminds
me
there
to
be
an
epworth
league
convention
here
week
after
next
and
i
been
told
to
invite
one
of
the
league
leaders
in
your
church
to
make
a
short
address
on
the
opening
night
you
a
league
leader
i
know
and
the
first
one
i
thought
about
so
i
asking
you
right
now
will
you
come
over
and
speak
for
us
now
though
always
said
he
was
no
speaker
he
had
never
hesitated
to
accept
invitations
to
take
part
in
league
conventions
but
this
was
different
he
made
no
answer
for
a
minute
and
in
the
pause
his
mind
was
busy
with
all
he
knew
and
all
he
had
acquired
at
second
hand
about
the
relations
of
colored
christians
and
white
and
particularly
about
what
might
be
thought
and
said
if
it
should
be
announced
that
he
was
to
speak
at
a
negro
epworth
league
convention
and
then
he
had
the
grace
to
blush
realizing
that
this
colored
pastor
waiting
so
quietly
for
his
answer
must
infallibly
have
followed
his
thoughts
in
his
swift
he
felt
that
the
least
amends
he
could
make
for
his
unspoken
discourtesy
was
a
prompt
acceptance
of
the
invitation
so
he
looked
up
and
said
hurriedly
driver
forgive
me
for
not
speaking
sooner
i
do
the
best
i
can
and
then
regaining
his
composure
have
you
any
idea
as
to
the
subject
i
supposed
to
talk
about
yes
the
colored
minister
replied
not
without
a
touch
of
curious
tenseness
in
his
voice
the
committee
wanted
me
to
get
a
representative
from
your
chapter
to
make
a
address
of
welcome
on
behalf
of
the
epworthians
of
first
church
again
was
forced
to
hesitate
here
he
was
an
epworthian
but
knowing
nothing
at
all
about
the
work
of
these
other
young
methodists
until
he
scarcely
knew
they
existed
and
now
he
was
asked
to
welcome
them
to
town
in
the
name
of
the
league
but
once
again
shame
compelled
him
to
take
the
bold
course
with
an
apologetic
smile
he
said
well
that
the
last
subject
i
could
imagine
you
give
to
any
of
us
at
first
church
your
young
people
and
ours
have
hardly
been
aware
of
each
other
and
it
seems
queer
that
you
should
ask
me
to
make
an
address
of
welcome
in
your
church
but
as
i
think
of
it
maybe
this
is
just
what
somebody
ought
to
do
and
i
might
as
well
try
it
trouble
is
what
am
i
going
to
say
we
risk
that
farwell
said
pastor
driver
confidently
just
say
what
you
think
and
you
do
all
right
was
by
no
means
sure
of
that
and
the
more
he
thought
about
his
speech
in
the
next
few
days
the
more
confused
he
became
any
ordinary
speech
of
welcome
would
be
easy
glad
you
were
sensible
enough
to
come
to
delafield
make
yourselves
at
home
freedom
of
the
city
our
latch
strings
are
out
command
us
for
anything
we
can
do
congratulate
you
on
the
fine
work
you
are
doing
know
when
we
return
this
visit
and
come
to
the
places
you
represent
you
will
make
us
welcome
and
so
on
but
it
was
plainly
impossible
for
him
to
talk
like
that
it
would
be
true
and
it
would
certainly
not
be
prudent
he
put
the
thing
up
to
what
i
say
dad
he
asked
you
know
we
have
had
much
to
do
with
the
people
of
saint
marks
and
maybe
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
make
any
sudden
change
as
to
that
even
if
some
of
us
wanted
to
but
i
got
to
talk
like
a
christian
whether
i
feel
like
one
or
not
my
son
his
father
answered
him
sententiously
it
your
speech
not
mine
but
if
an
old
fogy
may
suggest
something
why
not
forget
all
about
the
usual
sort
of
welcome
address
why
not
say
something
of
the
whole
program
of
our
church
as
it
affects
our
colored
people
it
touches
the
young
folks
more
than
any
others
welcome
them
to
that
that
all
very
fine
objected
everybody
who
on
for
an
address
of
welcome
is
advised
by
his
friends
to
cut
out
the
old
stuff
but
it
means
work
and
you
know
that
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
what
you
call
the
whole
program
of
our
church
for
the
colored
people
that
man
driver
knows
but
i
ca
ask
him
of
course
not
assented
but
you
can
ask
somebody
else
i
venture
drury
can
tell
you
where
to
find
all
you
would
want
to
talk
about
ask
him
you
never
bothered
by
bashfulness
with
him
if
i
remember
right
admitted
he
had
already
thought
of
that
he
and
i
were
talking
about
this
very
thing
the
night
before
i
went
to
see
about
that
roofing
but
here
the
point
i
not
to
represent
the
pastor
but
the
young
people
and
i
not
so
sure
that
what
drury
might
give
me
if
he
were
willing
could
be
made
to
fit
into
a
league
speech
under
the
circumstances
i
try
it
anyway
said
the
elder
farwell
he
nearly
always
willing
seems
to
me
and
a
pretty
safe
adviser
most
of
the
time
all
right
agreed
i
see
him
but
he
probably
tell
me
to
find
things
out
for
myself
he
a
good
scout
is
drury
the
best
pastor
i
ever
knew
or
want
to
know
but
sometimes
he
has
the
queerest
streaks
wo
help
a
fellow
a
little
bit
and
when
you
absolutely
sure
he
could
if
he
would
it
wo
be
enough
to
see
him
though
even
if
he
is
in
a
generous
mood
and
gives
me
more
dope
than
i
can
use
better
talk
to
some
of
the
league
people
and
still
he
gravitated
toward
the
pastor
study
it
was
the
easiest
way
the
pastor
was
always
in
a
more
generous
mood
than
gave
him
credit
for
it
was
only
that
he
never
supplied
crutches
when
people
needed
to
use
their
legs
nor
brains
when
they
needed
to
use
their
heads
nor
emotions
when
they
needed
to
use
their
hearts
he
told
to
rummage
through
the
one
bookshelf
in
the
study
which
held
his
small
but
usable
collection
of
books
and
pamphlets
on
the
negro
and
see
what
he
might
find
and
as
always
they
talked
i
can
tell
by
that
preacher
at
saint
marks
said
how
i
had
the
wrong
end
of
the
argument
that
night
we
came
from
hightower
address
a
man
with
a
big
job
like
his
has
to
be
a
pretty
big
man
and
he
needs
all
the
education
he
can
get
there
a
principle
in
that
suggested
drury
see
if
this
seems
a
reasonable
way
to
state
it
in
dealing
with
any
people
the
more
needy
they
are
the
better
equipped
and
trained
their
leaders
should
be
yes
sir
it
sounds
reasonable
enough
admitted
and
yet
i
never
thought
of
it
until
now
but
you
said
something
the
other
night
that
i
do
see
yet
that
may
be
no
fault
of
yours
my
boy
said
the
minister
with
a
laugh
what
was
it
why
you
said
men
like
hightower
are
inclined
to
overlook
the
work
of
the
church
and
that
it
was
the
church
own
fault
something
about
raising
new
questions
when
you
settle
old
ones
oh
yes
said
drury
i
remember
maybe
saying
it
the
own
fault
is
not
just
the
way
to
put
it
say
instead
that
you
educate
children
nor
yet
races
that
are
developing
and
expect
them
to
turn
out
exactly
according
to
your
notions
of
the
future
because
when
their
minds
are
growing
they
are
developing
not
according
to
something
in
you
but
according
to
something
in
them
so
every
teacher
and
i
suppose
every
parent
has
moments
of
wondering
how
it
ever
happens
that
young
people
learn
so
much
that
is
not
taught
them
and
it
the
same
way
with
races
you
mean
inquired
that
hightower
is
like
that
i
mean
pastor
drury
replied
that
everybody
is
like
that
if
we
had
given
the
negro
no
education
at
all
we
could
probably
have
kept
him
contented
for
a
good
many
years
with
just
being
if
we
had
given
no
negro
anything
but
a
chance
the
race
would
have
been
pretty
slow
to
develop
discontent
but
hightower
went
to
yale
and
du
bois
went
to
harvard
and
germany
and
pickens
went
to
yale
and
so
on
thousands
of
colored
men
and
women
have
been
graduated
from
colleges
of
liberal
arts
and
so
they
are
not
satisfied
with
conditions
which
would
have
been
heavenly
bliss
to
their
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
i
know
i
stupid
said
a
trifle
ruefully
but
i
always
supposed
that
education
was
good
for
everybody
now
you
seem
to
say
that
education
makes
people
discontented
of
course
it
does
said
drury
that
the
reason
it
is
good
for
them
would
you
be
content
to
call
a
shack
home
and
live
as
the
plantation
hand
lives
if
you
would
the
world
profit
out
of
you
and
your
own
profit
out
of
yourself
would
be
much
real
education
does
exactly
mean
discontent
and
the
people
who
are
discontented
may
be
uncomfortable
to
live
with
if
we
think
they
ought
to
be
docile
but
they
get
us
forward
maybe
you
right
conceded
and
the
church
is
not
to
be
blamed
still
if
our
work
for
the
black
man
has
made
him
troublesome
and
given
him
ideas
bigger
than
he
can
hope
to
realize
how
does
that
fit
in
with
our
christianity
should
the
church
be
a
peacemaker
instead
of
a
now
john
wesley
the
other
said
in
mock
protest
that
sermon
of
mine
on
peace
but
a
sword
must
have
been
wasted
on
you
our
lord
most
certainly
came
to
make
peace
and
he
spoke
a
great
blessing
on
peacemakers
but
he
was
himself
the
world
greatest
disturber
peace
while
there
is
injustice
or
ignorance
or
any
sort
of
wickedness
has
nothing
to
do
with
christ
intentions
i
know
that
the
of
the
north
and
the
more
persistent
of
the
south
were
always
asking
for
that
sort
of
peace
but
they
could
have
it
nobody
ever
can
have
it
so
long
as
jesus
has
a
single
follower
in
the
world
well
what
has
all
this
to
do
asked
with
our
church
special
work
for
the
colored
people
ah
yes
the
pastor
answered
that
the
very
thing
you
must
find
out
before
you
make
that
address
of
welcome
by
this
time
had
gathered
up
a
pile
of
books
pamphlets
reports
and
papers
enough
he
thought
to
serve
as
the
raw
material
of
a
thesis
and
he
said
to
drury
would
you
mind
if
i
took
this
home
i
bring
it
all
back
and
it
not
likely
i
damage
it
the
asking
was
no
more
than
a
form
for
years
the
people
of
first
church
had
known
themselves
freely
welcome
to
any
book
in
the
shelves
an
interest
in
his
books
was
passport
to
his
special
favor
his
own
evident
love
for
books
had
been
the
best
possible
insurance
that
these
particular
borrowers
would
be
more
scrupulous
than
the
general
this
bit
of
pastoral
work
it
should
be
said
with
the
frequent
that
grew
out
of
it
was
not
least
among
all
the
reasons
why
first
church
people
thought
their
bachelor
minister
just
the
man
for
them
so
off
went
with
his
armful
and
for
a
week
thereafter
you
might
have
supposed
he
was
cramming
for
a
final
exam
of
some
sort
early
in
his
preparation
he
decided
that
his
father
advice
was
wise
and
he
put
the
stress
of
his
effort
on
the
church
work
and
how
negro
youth
had
responded
to
it
the
other
matter
was
too
delicate
he
felt
for
his
amateur
handling
and
besides
he
was
not
altogether
sure
even
of
his
own
position
on
the
convention
night
saint
marks
was
crowded
with
young
colored
people
some
of
whom
came
from
places
a
hundred
miles
away
they
were
badged
and
pennanted
quite
in
the
fashion
to
which
was
accustomed
but
for
their
color
and
to
be
frank
for
a
little
more
restraint
and
thoughtfulness
in
their
really
unusual
singing
they
were
just
young
methodists
at
a
convention
not
different
from
caucasian
methodists
of
the
same
age
when
turn
came
to
speak
the
chairman
introduced
him
in
the
fewest
possible
words
but
with
the
courtesy
which
belongs
to
saying
farwell
will
make
the
delegates
welcome
in
the
name
of
the
first
church
epworthians
and
he
did
he
had
his
notes
pretty
full
ones
to
which
he
made
frequent
references
but
the
quality
in
his
speech
which
drew
the
convention
cheers
was
its
frank
and
natural
simplicity
i
would
have
begged
off
from
this
duty
if
i
could
he
began
but
i
knew
from
the
moment
i
was
asked
that
i
had
no
decent
excuse
but
i
knew
so
little
of
what
i
ought
to
say
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
dig
just
as
i
used
to
do
at
school
the
result
of
my
digging
is
that
i
know
now
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
know
why
first
church
young
people
should
join
in
welcoming
you
to
delafield
some
of
them
do
know
yet
any
more
than
i
did
ten
days
ago
but
i
intend
to
enlighten
them
the
first
chance
i
get
we
first
church
epworthians
might
welcome
you
for
many
reasons
but
i
have
decided
to
stick
to
two
because
as
i
have
said
i
have
just
been
learning
something
about
them
we
welcome
you
then
because
you
represent
the
most
eager
hunger
for
complete
education
that
exists
in
america
unless
our
new
hebrew
citizens
can
match
it
no
others
can
the
record
of
our
church
schools
for
your
race
prove
that
it
simply
is
not
possible
to
keep
the
negro
youth
out
of
school
they
will
walk
further
eat
less
work
harder
and
stay
longer
to
get
an
education
than
for
anything
else
in
the
world
not
so
many
days
ago
i
ignorantly
thought
that
the
r
was
all
that
ought
to
be
offered
partly
because
the
need
is
so
great
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
that
thought
when
i
tell
you
that
now
i
know
what
ignorance
it
revealed
in
me
the
great
need
is
the
strongest
argument
for
the
highest
education
because
of
your
great
numbers
and
because
of
your
ever
intenser
racial
the
negro
must
educate
the
negro
be
physician
for
the
negro
preach
to
the
negro
nurse
the
negro
lead
the
negro
in
all
his
upward
effort
otherwise
these
things
will
be
done
badly
or
patronizingly
or
not
at
all
but
if
you
are
to
do
your
own
educational
work
your
educators
must
be
fully
equipped
it
is
not
possible
to
send
the
whole
race
to
college
but
it
is
possible
to
send
youth
to
the
race
for
this
reason
our
church
has
established
normal
schools
colleges
of
liberal
arts
professional
schools
homes
for
college
girls
so
that
the
coming
leaders
of
your
people
may
have
access
to
the
best
the
world
offers
in
science
and
literature
in
medicine
and
law
in
business
and
religion
you
will
not
mistake
my
purpose
i
am
sure
in
saying
that
you
know
better
than
we
can
guess
how
your
people
through
no
fault
of
theirs
have
been
long
in
bondage
to
the
unskilled
hand
the
unawakened
mind
and
the
uninspired
heart
but
it
is
more
and
more
an
unwilling
bondage
and
our
church
your
church
has
set
up
these
schools
and
these
training
homes
i
have
mentioned
as
though
she
were
saying
in
the
words
of
one
of
your
own
wonderful
songs
my
people
go
and
the
results
are
coming
your
two
bishops
one
in
the
south
and
one
in
africa
your
leaders
in
the
church
highest
councils
your
educators
your
business
men
your
great
preachers
are
part
of
the
answer
to
your
church
passion
to
give
full
freedom
to
all
her
people
for
you
are
people
the
people
of
the
christian
church
we
are
all
god
people
it
seems
to
me
that
just
now
god
is
interested
in
bringing
to
every
race
in
the
world
the
chance
of
liberty
for
hand
and
head
and
heart
god
has
greater
things
for
us
all
to
do
than
we
can
now
understand
but
all
his
purposes
must
wait
on
our
getting
free
from
everything
that
would
defeat
our
work
our
young
people
welcome
you
because
with
all
else
you
represent
a
great
purpose
to
make
religion
intelligent
you
know
as
we
do
that
piety
to
be
vital
must
be
mixed
with
sound
learning
you
have
the
missionary
spirit
which
never
thrives
in
an
atmosphere
of
resistance
to
education
you
are
christians
fellow
workers
we
are
sharers
with
you
in
personal
devotion
to
our
lord
and
in
the
common
purpose
to
make
him
master
of
all
life
and
finally
let
me
say
it
bluntly
we
welcome
you
because
we
believe
in
your
pride
of
race
and
honor
it
in
you
as
we
honor
it
in
our
fellow
citizens
of
other
races
they
and
you
have
some
things
in
common
but
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
when
i
congratulate
you
on
what
is
peculiar
to
you
you
have
been
fully
americanized
for
more
generations
than
most
other
americans
you
have
no
need
to
strive
after
the
american
spirit
i
have
a
friend
of
greek
birth
who
thinks
pridefully
back
to
the
golden
age
of
greece
and
i
envy
him
his
glorying
but
your
pride
of
race
turning
away
from
the
unhappy
past
sees
your
golden
age
in
the
days
to
come
not
in
the
dim
yesterdays
you
are
the
makers
not
the
inheritors
of
a
great
destiny
for
that
noble
future
which
is
to
be
yours
in
our
common
america
you
do
well
to
hold
as
above
price
the
purity
and
strength
of
your
racial
life
better
than
we
of
caucasian
stock
you
know
that
only
so
may
all
the
values
be
fully
realized
which
are
to
be
africa
contribution
to
the
spiritual
wealth
of
america
and
the
world
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
for
the
implications
of
the
last
sentence
were
not
as
plain
as
they
might
have
been
but
when
the
audience
caught
somewhat
daring
appeal
to
its
racial

chapter
vii
the
first
american
civilization
the
full
record
of
commercial
career
must
he
left
to
some
other
chronicler
but
an
occasional
reference
to
it
can
not
be
omitted
from
these
pages
pastor
drury
brother
albert
a
saint
louis
business
man
who
knew
the
old
city
by
the
mississippi
from
the
levees
to
the
university
was
a
citizen
who
loved
his
city
so
well
that
he
did
not
need
to
join
a
boosters
club
to
prove
it
the
two
drurys
saw
each
other
as
both
averred
all
too
seldom
on
the
infrequent
occasions
when
they
met
as
for
instance
during
a
certain
church
federation
gathering
which
had
brought
the
minister
down
to
saint
louis
from
delafield
their
visiting
was
a
joyous
thing
to
see
lounging
in
the
city
club
one
day
after
lunch
with
every
other
subject
of
common
interest
at
least
touched
on
brother
albert
turned
to
brother
walter
and
how
goes
the
church
and
parish
of
delafield
you
told
me
long
ago
that
you
wanted
to
stay
there
ten
years
it
more
than
eight
now
does
the
mark
yet
stand
yes
it
still
stands
if
nothing
should
interfere
said
walter
he
had
never
told
his
brother
the
reason
back
of
that
mark
and
he
was
not
ready
even
yet
for
that
of
late
he
had
taken
to
wondering
when
and
how
the
experiment
would
come
to
its
crisis
he
wanted
some
help
just
now
and
here
might
be
an
opening
so
he
went
on
i
been
working
away
at
several
special
jobs
as
you
know
i
like
to
do
and
one
of
them
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
a
young
fellow
named
farwell
john
wesley
farwell
who
be
the
mainstay
of
the
best
hardware
store
in
delafield
before
long
if
he
sticks
to
it
everybody
calls
him
and
he
the
sort
of
boy
that
has
always
interested
me
he
so
he
paused
his
thoughts
busy
with
the
experiment
well
his
brother
broke
in
after
a
moment
what
this
young
john
wesley
methodist
been
doing
it
is
altogether
what
he
has
been
doing
but
it
what
i
like
to
see
him
get
a
chance
to
do
explained
the
preacher
he
tied
to
the
store
and
to
delafield
so
far
and
i
reasons
for
wanting
him
to
see
some
parts
of
this
country
he
never
see
from
main
street
in
our
town
well
brother
mine
maybe
he
could
be
induced
to
leave
that
particular
main
street
there
where
we
get
the
best
citizens
of
this
village
has
he
any
objections
to
making
a
change
to
travel
for
instance
i
do
know
said
walter
probably
not
he
young
and
has
a
pretty
good
education
i
do
know
that
he
ambitious
to
make
himself
the
best
hardware
man
in
our
section
and
i
believe
he
do
it
in
time
personally
i
him
to
travel
but
how
would
anybody
go
about
getting
him
the
chance
albert
drury
laughed
that
easy
only
a
preacher
could
be
expected
to
see
it
if
any
country
boy
really
knows
the
stuff
he
handles
whether
it
is
hardware
or
candy
or
hides
he
can
get
the
chance
all
right
this
town
wants
him
do
you
know
that
the
big
wholesale
houses
recruit
their
sales
forces
by
spotting
just
such
boys
as
your
john
wesley
farwell
may
be
but
what
do
you
mean
by
calling
him
average
if
he
such
a
keen
judge
of
hardware
oh
well
he
more
than
average
on
hardware
but
he
so
beautifully
average
human
one
of
those
chaps
who
do
most
of
the
real
work
of
the
world
all
right
old
man
i
not
sure
that
i
follow
you
but
anyway
i
may
be
of
some
use
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
know
the
very
man
peter
mcdougall
who
a
friend
i
can
bank
on
is
sales
manager
of
the
cummings
hardware
corporation
nothing
will
come
of
it
if
peter
is
not
impressed
but
all
i
need
to
do
is
to
tell
him
there
a
prospective
star
salesman
up
at
delafield
and
his
man
who
has
that
territory
will
be
looking
up
your
john
wesley
before
you
have
time
to
write
another
sermon
by
the
way
he
added
what
part
of
the
country
did
you
say
you
wanted
young
farwell
to
see
i
did
say
the
preacher
admitted
but
i
would
like
him
to
see
something
of
the
southwest
i
want
to
see
what
will
happen
when
he
bumps
up
against
the
sort
of
civilization
that
followed
the
spanish
to
america
well
of
course
you
know
that
wholesale
hardware
houses
do
run
salesmen
excursions
to
help
methodist
preachers
try
out
the
effect
of
american
history
on
their
young
parishioners
no
matter
how
lofty
the
motive
and
albert
drury
poked
his
brother
in
the
ribs
but
supposing
this
boy
is
otherwise
good
stuff
he
be
in
the
right
place
if
he
goes
with
the
cummings
people
a
big
share
of
their
business
is
in
that
end
of
the
world
if
had
been
told
of
this
conversation
which
he
was
he
might
not
have
been
quite
so
mystified
over
the
letter
from
the
great
peter
mcdougall
which
came
a
few
weeks
after
the
preacher
return
from
saint
louis
mcdougall
he
knew
well
by
reputation
having
heard
about
him
from
every
cummings
man
who
unpacked
samples
in
delafield
and
to
be
invited
to
saint
louis
by
the
great
man
with
the
possibility
of
an
opening
ultimately
in
our
sales
force
was
a
surprise
as
interesting
as
it
was
unexpected
naturally
could
not
know
how
much
careful
investigation
had
preceded
the
writing
of
that
letter
the
cummings
corporation
did
not
act
on
impulse
but
he
would
have
accepted
the
invitation
in
any
case
and
that
is
enough
for
the
present
purpose
of
the
story
of
first
business
venture
away
from
delafield
not
without
some
hesitation
did
he
close
with
the
cummings
offer
but
after
he
had
talked
it
all
over
with
the
folks
at
home
and
then
all
over
again
out
at
deep
creek
with
jeannette
shenk
who
was
both
sorry
and
proud
it
was
settled
reaching
saint
louis
the
canny
mcdougall
looked
him
over
and
thought
him
worth
trying
out
so
over
he
went
to
the
stock
department
then
followed
busy
weeks
in
the
buildings
of
the
cummings
hardware
corporation
down
by
the
river
learning
the
stock
he
discovered
before
the
end
of
the
first
day
that
he
had
never
yet
guessed
what
hardware
meant
he
wandered
through
the
mazes
of
the
vast
warehouses
until
his
legs
ached
much
and
his
eyes
ached
more
at
last
came
the
day
when
he
found
himself
on
the
road
not
alone
of
course
but
in
tow
of
fred
finch
an
old
cummings
salesman
who
had
occasionally
made
delafield
the
cummings
people
did
not
throw
their
new
men
overboard
and
let
them
swim
if
they
could
they
had
a
careful
training
system
of
which
the
stockroom
days
were
one
part
and
this
personally
conducted
introduction
to
the
road
was
another
albert
drury
had
been
sufficiently
interested
in
his
brother
wish
to
drop
a
hint
to
mcdougall
to
which
that
executive
would
have
paid
no
attention
if
it
had
not
fitted
in
just
then
with
the
requirements
of
his
sales
policy
but
the
hint
sent
out
with
finch
over
the
longest
route
which
the
house
worked
for
trade
on
the
map
this
route
was
a
great
thing
with
its
point
at
saint
louis
and
the
whole
southwest
this
side
of
the
colorado
river
included
in
the
sweep
of
its
sides
and
top
to
fred
finch
it
was
a
weary
journey
but
gave
no
thought
to
its
discomforts
he
was
seeing
the
country
as
well
as
learning
to
sell
hardware
and
both
occupations
were
highly
absorbing
before
long
he
found
too
that
he
was
seeing
a
new
people
storekeepers
he
knew
as
being
of
his
own
guild
the
small
towns
were
much
like
delafield
when
you
had
become
used
to
their
newer
crudeness
of
architecture
and
their
sprawling
planlessness
and
the
people
who
used
hardware
were
very
much
like
his
customers
at
home
he
had
no
fear
of
failing
to
become
a
salesman
after
the
first
few
experiences
under
finch
watchful
eye
his
father
had
taught
him
a
sort
of
salesmanship
which
experience
could
only
make
more
effective
he
knew
already
never
to
sell
what
he
could
see
his
customer
ought
not
to
buy
and
he
knew
always
to
contrive
as
much
as
possible
that
the
customer
should
do
the
selling
to
himself
the
elder
farwell
used
to
say
let
your
customer
once
see
the
advantage
that
buying
is
to
him
and
he
care
what
advantage
selling
is
to
you
now
as
has
been
said
before
this
is
not
a
salesman
story
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
before
the
two
got
back
to
saint
louis
knew
he
had
found
his
trade
he
was
a
natural
salesman
and
so
fred
finch
reported
to
peter
mcdougall
if
it
hardware
he
said
that
boy
can
sell
it
and
i
do
care
where
you
put
him
he
can
sell
to
people
who
ca
speak
english
and
i
believe
he
could
sell
to
deaf
mutes
or
the
blind
he
knows
the
line
and
they
know
he
knows
it
why
this
very
first
trip
he
sold
more
goods
on
his
own
than
on
the
house
brand
said
he
knew
what
the
stuff
would
do
and
people
took
that
who
usually
want
to
know
about
the
guarantee
all
of
which
peter
mcdougall
filed
where
he
would
not
forget
it
but
to
go
back
to
the
trip
itself
along
the
railway
in
kansas
began
to
see
without
trucks
roughly
fitted
up
for
dwellings
men
and
women
and
children
were
in
occupation
and
all
the
household
functions
and
processes
were
going
on
though
somewhat
primitively
mexicans
said
finch
as
pointed
out
the
cars
section
hands
when
i
first
began
to
make
this
territory
you
never
saw
them
except
right
down
on
the
border
but
they
have
moved
a
long
way
east
and
north
i
saw
lots
of
them
in
the
yards
at
kansas
city
last
time
i
was
there
watched
the
life
with
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
here
and
there
were
poor
little
attempts
at
color
and
adornment
flowers
in
window
boxes
and
bits
of
lace
at
the
windows
delafield
had
plenty
of
foreigners
but
these
were
foreigners
of
another
sort
they
seemed
to
be
entirely
at
home
i
suppose
he
said
to
finch
these
mexicans
have
come
to
the
states
to
get
away
from
the
robbery
and
ruin
that
mexico
has
had
instead
of
government
these
last
ten
years
and
more
yes
finch
answered
thousands
of
but
not
all
some
of
these
mexicans
are
older
americans
than
we
are
we
took
over
when
we
got
texas
and
new
mexico
and
california
from
old
mexico
they
were
here
then
speaking
the
spanish
their
ancestors
had
learned
three
hundred
years
ago
and
more
but
they
all
the
same
mexicans
no
matter
on
which
side
of
the
rio
grande
they
were
born
of
course
those
born
on
this
side
have
had
some
advantages
that
the
peons
never
knew
but
do
you
mean
wanted
to
know
that
they
are
not
really
american
citizens
fred
finch
said
no
he
did
mean
exactly
that
certainly
those
born
on
this
side
were
american
citizens
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
and
those
who
came
across
the
rio
grande
could
get
naturalized
but
that
made
little
real
difference
a
mexican
was
a
mexican
and
you
had
to
deal
with
him
as
one
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
that
explanation
but
he
preferred
to
wait
until
he
had
seen
enough
so
that
he
could
ask
his
questions
more
intelligently
so
he
kept
relatively
still
but
his
eyes
did
not
cease
from
observing
as
the
trip
progressed
and
the
jumps
between
towns
became
longer
the
young
salesman
had
time
to
see
a
good
deal
in
the
far
southwest
he
became
aware
that
the
increasingly
numerous
mexican
population
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
dwellers
more
or
less
migratory
it
was
a
settled
people
its
little
adobe
villages
queer
and
quaint
as
they
seemed
to
eyes
were
centers
of
established
life
and
he
discovered
that
in
these
villages
always
one
building
overshadowed
all
the
rest
one
day
as
they
were
headed
towards
el
paso
he
ventured
to
mention
this
to
his
traveling
companion
seems
to
me
he
said
that
none
of
these
little
mud
villages
is
too
poor
to
have
a
church
and
mostly
a
pretty
good
church
too
how
do
they
manage
it
now
finch
was
no
student
of
church
life
but
he
did
know
a
little
about
the
country
that
the
way
it
is
all
over
this
southwest
my
boy
and
across
the
line
in
old
mexico
it
a
good
deal
more
so
my
guess
is
that
the
churches
and
the
priests
began
by
teaching
the
people
that
whatever
else
happened
they
had
to
put
up
for
the
church
and
from
what
noticed
i
reckon
that
now
nothing
else
matters
much
to
the
church
it
has
become
a
kind
of
poor
relation
that
got
to
be
fed
and
helped
whether
it
amounts
to
anything
or
not
but
it
a
long
way
from
being
as
humble
and
thankful
as
you
would
naturally
expect
a
poor
relation
to
be
during
the
el
paso
layover
the
two
of
them
took
a
day
across
the
international
bridge
had
watched
the
mexicans
coming
over
and
he
wanted
to
see
the
country
they
came
from
you
not
see
much
over
there
a
friendly
spoken
customs
official
told
him
it
a
pretty
poor
section
of
desert
about
these
parts
you
ought
to
get
away
down
into
the
heart
of
the
country
yes
i
suppose
so
responded
but
there
is
time
on
this
trip
are
such
people
as
these
coming
over
to
the
united
states
right
along
i
should
say
they
are
said
the
man
of
authority
with
emphasis
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
the
mexican
population
of
the
united
states
has
about
doubled
three
quarters
of
a
million
have
crossed
the
rio
grande
somewhere
or
the
border
further
west
you
people
from
the
east
make
a
big
fuss
over
immigration
from
europe
but
you
hardly
seem
to
know
that
a
regular
flood
has
been
pouring
in
through
these
southwestern
gateways
you
will
some
day
what
they
saw
on
the
mexican
side
of
the
bridge
was
as
the
customs
man
had
said
nothing
much
but
came
away
with
a
strange
sense
of
depression
he
had
never
before
seen
so
much
of
the
raw
material
of
misery
and
squalor
what
he
had
observed
with
wondering
pity
in
the
villages
on
the
american
side
was
as
nothing
to
the
unrelieved
hopelessness
of
the
south
bank
of
the
river
that
night
in
the
hotel
lobby
noticed
a
but
rather
elderly
man
whom
he
recognized
as
one
whom
he
had
seen
over
in
mexico
earlier
in
the
day
with
the
memory
of
what
he
had
seen
yet
fresh
upon
him
ventured
a
commonplace
or
two
with
the
stranger
and
found
him
so
genial
and
interesting
that
they
were
still
talking
long
after
fred
finch
had
yawned
himself
off
to
bed
i
thought
i
remembered
seeing
you
over
there
said
the
unknown
and
you
did
look
like
a
seasoned
traveler
more
like
the
amateur
i
am
myself
though
i
do
get
about
a
little
i
no
seasoned
sightseer
said
this
is
my
first
time
out
and
that
maybe
the
reason
i
developed
so
much
curiosity
about
the
people
we
saw
do
you
know
much
about
them
who
the
mexicans
the
other
man
smiled
and
then
was
suddenly
serious
my
friend
i
begin
to
think
i
making
the
mexicans
my
hobby
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
if
you
are
really
interested
in
the
mexicans
as
human
beings
i
rather
tell
you
what
i
know
than
do
anything
else
i
can
think
of
it
is
often
i
find
a
traveling
man
who
cares
well
i
do
care
asserted
stoutly
they
people
folks
are
they
and
it
looks
as
though
they
could
stand
having
somebody
get
interested
in
them
a
little
ah
i
see
now
what
you
are
you
are
that
remarkable
combination
a
traveling
man
and
a
christian
am
i
right
why
i
suppose
so
said
with
a
smile
and
a
touch
of
the
old
boyish
pride
in
his
name
my
initials
as
you
might
say
are
wesley
and
i
not
ashamed
of
them
and
that
means
you
are
not
only
a
christian
but
a
methodist
my
dear
man
we
must
shake
on
that
i
a
methodist
myself
as
the
stage
robber
said
to
brother
van
with
the
romantic
name
of
tanner
got
my
first
interest
in
mexico
and
the
mexicans
when
my
daughter
married
a
young
methodist
preacher
and
they
went
down
there
as
missionaries
i
make
a
trip
to
see
them
and
the
babies
about
once
a
year
but
now
i
am
getting
interested
in
these
people
as
an
american
and
i
hope
a
christian
who
tries
to
work
at
the
business
what
did
you
say
your
other
name
was
had
said
but
now
he
did
and
the
two
settled
to
their
talk
this
william
tanner
some
sort
of
retired
business
man
certainly
seemed
to
know
his
mexico
and
he
had
that
most
subtle
of
all
stimulants
a
curious
and
sympathetic
hearer
by
consequence
he
was
eager
to
give
all
that
would
take
before
long
had
edged
in
a
question
about
the
church
he
said
you
know
tanner
we
have
a
pretty
good
roman
catholic
church
in
my
home
town
though
father
does
tie
up
much
to
what
the
other
churches
are
trying
to
do
and
some
of
his
flock
seem
to
me
pretty
wild
for
sheep
now
these
churches
down
here
are
all
roman
catholic
too
yet
they
certainly
do
look
any
kin
to
saint
ursula
at
delafield
are
they
it
was
the
sort
of
question
which
william
tanner
had
asked
himself
many
a
time
when
he
first
came
to
mexico
this
is
the
way
of
it
farwell
he
said
the
church
came
to
mexico
and
to
all
latin
america
from
spain
and
portugal
it
had
a
few
great
names
we
must
acknowledge
in
those
early
times
but
in
a
little
while
it
settled
down
to
two
activities
to
make
itself
the
sole
religious
authority
and
to
get
rich
it
was
a
church
of
god
and
gold
and
as
a
matter
of
course
it
preached
that
it
was
the
supreme
arbiter
of
life
and
death
in
matters
of
faith
and
extended
its
authority
into
every
relation
of
life
it
brought
from
the
lands
of
the
inquisition
the
idea
of
priestly
power
and
there
was
none
to
dispute
it
in
latin
america
as
there
was
in
the
colonies
of
our
own
country
it
gave
the
people
little
instruction
and
no
responsibility
or
freedom
it
made
outward
submission
the
test
of
piety
and
faith
and
so
when
spain
lost
its
grip
on
the
western
hemisphere
the
church
found
itself
with
nothing
but
its
claim
of
power
to
fall
back
on
well
you
know
that
would
work
only
with
the
ignorant
and
the
superstitious
mexico
and
all
latin
america
for
that
matter
clear
to
the
straits
of
magellan
is
a
land
of
innumerable
crosses
but
no
christ
the
church
has
had
left
to
it
what
it
wanted
that
is
the
priestly
prerogatives
it
marries
baptizes
absolves
buries
where
the
people
can
pay
the
fees
and
the
people
for
various
reasons
have
not
cared
that
this
is
all
if
they
are
afraid
or
want
to
make
a
show
they
call
in
the
church
if
they
do
care
or
if
they
are
poor
they
go
unbaptized
unmarried
unshriven
and
do
not
see
that
it
makes
any
difference
they
have
no
understanding
of
the
church
as
a
christian
institution
in
fact
i
think
it
would
puzzle
most
of
them
to
tell
what
a
true
church
ought
to
be
now
all
this
is
the
church
reward
for
its
ancient
choice
which
so
far
as
i
can
see
is
still
its
choice
to
the
average
latin
american
the
church
is
and
in
the
nature
of
things
must
be
a
demander
of
pay
for
ceremonial
and
a
bitterly
jealous
defender
of
all
its
old
autocratic
claims
that
is
of
the
nature
of
the
church
but
i
do
understand
interposed
if
the
people
have
no
real
use
for
the
church
why
do
they
support
it
it
certainly
is
supported
that
farwell
is
the
tragedy
of
the
church
in
all
these
lands
said
tanner
soberly
the
church
began
by
looking
to
its
own
interests
first
it
wanted
great
establishments
and
a
docile
people
it
found
the
gospel
hard
to
preach
to
the
natives
the
real
gospel
i
mean
the
cruelties
and
greed
of
the
conquest
had
made
impossible
any
preaching
of
a
ministering
merciful
and
unselfish
christ
in
fact
the
vast
majority
of
the
priests
who
came
over
from
europe
brought
with
them
no
such
ideas
the
church
was
ruler
not
missionary
and
so
far
as
it
dares
it
sticks
stubbornly
to
that
notion
even
to
this
day
so
it
has
had
to
make
practical
compromise
with
the
paganism
and
superstition
it
found
here
many
of
its
religious
observances
are
the
aboriginal
pagan
practices
disguised
in
christian
dress
and
given
christian
names
the
church
has
sold
its
birthright
for
the
privilege
of
exploiting
the
credulity
and
the
fears
of
the
people
it
has
made
merchandise
of
all
its
functions
now
after
the
centuries
have
come
and
gone
both
church
and
people
through
long
custom
are
willing
to
have
it
so
the
people
have
their
great
churches
with
incense
and
lights
and
all
the
pomp
of
medaeival
days
but
they
have
no
living
christ
and
no
thought
of
him
the
priests
have
their
trade
in
ceremonial
and
their
perquisites
but
they
have
no
power
over
the
hearts
of
men
as
his
new
acquaintance
paused
for
breath
after
this
long
answer
to
a
short
question
remembering
something
fred
finch
had
said
brought
the
remark
in
the
man
who
is
showing
me
the
ropes
as
a
hardware
man
tells
me
that
all
over
latin
america
the
church
is
likely
to
be
the
one
real
building
in
every
town
and
village
is
that
also
something
that
the
people
are
so
used
to
that
they
do
notice
it
any
more
oh
yes
tanner
assented
i
suppose
the
contrast
between
the
church
and
the
miserable
little
hovels
around
it
never
occurs
to
any
of
them
it
has
always
been
so
the
church
has
built
itself
up
out
of
the
community
and
for
the
most
part
it
puts
very
little
back
it
conducts
schools
to
be
sure
and
yet
eighty
per
cent
of
the
mexican
people
are
illiterate
it
has
some
few
institutions
of
help
and
mercy
but
the
whole
land
cries
out
for
doctors
and
teachers
and
friendly
human
concern
is
that
really
so
asked
do
the
people
really
want
our
missionaries
or
are
we
protestants
just
shoving
ourselves
in
i
can
see
that
something
is
desperately
wrong
but
we
are
mostly
saxon
and
they
are
latins
do
these
people
want
what
to
them
must
seem
a
queer
religion
and
a
lot
of
strange
ideas
so
long
as
they
do
not
understand
what
we
come
for
naturally
they
are
suspicious
when
they
find
out
they
take
to
mission
work
and
missionaries
with
very
little
urging
i
wish
you
would
meet
my
tanner
said
with
positiveness
why
the
one
tormenting
desire
of
that
man
life
is
to
see
more
missionaries
sent
down
into
mexico
more
doctors
more
teachers
more
workers
of
every
sort
he
writes
letters
to
the
board
of
foreign
missions
that
would
make
your
heart
ache
the
church
at
home
could
oversupply
mexico
with
the
sort
of
help
it
desperately
needs
if
it
should
turn
every
recruit
that
way
and
disregard
all
the
rest
of
the
world
mission
fields
do
you
mean
asked
who
was
seeing
new
questions
bob
up
every
time
an
earlier
one
was
answered
do
you
mean
that
so
many
missionaries
could
be
used
on
productive
christian
work
right
away
or
is
it
that
we
ought
to
have
a
big
force
to
prepare
for
the
long
future
of
our
work
in
mexico
now
was
not
so
sure
that
this
was
an
intelligent
question
but
he
had
heard
that
in
some
mission
fields
it
was
necessary
to
wait
years
for
real
and
permanent
results
his
companion
saw
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
the
question
it
was
part
of
the
whole
problem
i
mean
it
both
ways
he
said
what
i
seen
of
our
methodist
work
down
in
these
parts
particularly
its
schools
and
one
wonderful
hospital
makes
me
sure
we
could
get
big
harvests
of
interest
and
success
right
off
we
doing
it
already
considering
our
relatively
small
force
and
our
limited
equipment
but
all
latin
american
work
takes
patience
i
made
one
trip
down
as
far
as
santiago
de
chile
and
what
is
true
in
mexico
is
i
guess
about
as
true
in
other
parts
the
roman
catholic
church
has
been
here
four
hundred
years
and
its
biggest
result
is
that
the
people
who
do
fear
it
despise
it
latin
america
is
called
christian
but
it
is
a
world
in
which
what
you
and
i
call
religion
simply
does
not
count
well
then
that
what
makes
me
talk
about
the
need
of
persistence
and
patience
the
bad
effects
of
three
or
four
hundred
years
of
such
religion
as
has
been
taught
and
practiced
between
the
rio
grande
and
cape
horn
ca
be
got
rid
of
in
a
hurry
wait
till
mexico
has
had
a
real
chance
at
the
christ
of
the
new
testament
for
three
hundred
years
and
then
see
had
yet
another
question
to
ask
before
he
was
ready
to
call
it
a
day
if
all
that
you
say
is
so
and
i
believe
it
is
tanner
why
should
so
many
of
the
mexicans
hate
the
united
states
they
do
for
heard
it
spoken
of
a
good
deal
lately
and
i
remember
what
was
always
said
when
some
one
proposed
that
we
should
intervene
to
make
peace
and
restore
order
in
mexico
it
would
take
ten
years
and
a
million
men
and
all
mexico
would
unite
to
oppose
us
you
talk
about
how
much
the
mexicans
need
us
and
want
us
but
a
great
many
of
them
surely
do
want
us
at
all
i
know
what
that
means
tanner
admitted
and
it
is
true
we
are
all
influenced
by
the
past
look
at
the
history
of
our
dealings
with
mexico
the
very
ideas
we
fought
to
establish
as
the
charter
of
our
own
freedom
we
repudiated
when
we
dealt
with
mexico
three
quarters
of
a
century
ago
we
had
every
advantage
and
what
we
wanted
we
took
certainly
we
have
done
better
by
it
than
mexico
might
have
done
but
i
never
heard
that
reason
given
in
a
court
of
law
to
excuse
the
same
sort
of
transaction
if
it
touched
only
private
individuals
then
in
late
years
big
business
has
gone
into
mexico
it
has
had
to
take
big
chances
it
has
paid
better
wages
than
the
peon
could
earn
any
other
way
it
has
a
lot
to
its
credit
but
it
has
been
much
like
big
business
in
other
places
and
anyway
the
admitted
great
profits
have
enriched
the
foreigner
not
the
mexican
besides
mexico
is
not
the
states
as
you
say
it
is
latin
in
its
civilization
not
saxon
it
does
not
want
our
sort
of
culture
and
some
of
our
missionaries
both
of
the
church
and
of
industry
have
thought
that
the
mexican
ought
to
be
that
a
fatal
mistake
in
any
mission
field
outside
the
states
all
in
all
you
can
see
that
it
is
entirely
inevitable
that
the
mexican
should
understand
our
motives
or
appreciate
them
when
he
does
understand
but
that
all
the
more
reason
for
bearing
down
hard
on
every
form
of
genuine
missionary
work
it
the
only
thing
that
we
americans
can
do
in
mexico
with
any
hope
of
avoiding
suspicion
or
of
our
presence
being
acceptable
to
the
mexicans
in
the
long
run
we
got
to
fight
the
backfire
of
our
american
commercialism
and
the
prejudice
which
is
as
real
on
the
texas
side
of
the
river
as
it
is
on
the
other
for
if
the
mexican
thinks
in
terms
of
the
american
of
the
southwest
is
just
as
likely
to
think
in
terms
of
when
and
tanner
parted
for
the
night
it
was
with
the
mutual
promise
that
they
would
have
another
talk
some
time
the
next
day
but
the
promise
could
not
be
kept
the
retired
business
man
heard
from
some
of
his
business
in
the
early
morning
and
had
just
time
to
say
a
hurried
farewell
as
he
put
it
i
thought
i
had
retired
but
unless
i
get
back
to
look
after
this
particular
affair
i
may
have
to
get
into
the
harness
again
and
that
is
not
a
cheerful
prospect
at
my
age
so
i
go
to
business
to
avert
the
danger
of
going
back
to
business
a
little
later
the
two
hardware
salesmen
were
in
el
paso
again
after
a
couple
of
side
trips
took
advantage
of
a
long
train
wait
to
hunt
up
the
city
library
he
wanted
to
know
whether
tanner
was
right
in
saying
that
the
question
was
much
the
same
everywhere
he
wrote
a
letter
to
drury
that
night
having
thus
far
used
picture
postcards
until
he
was
ashamed
in
the
letter
he
took
occasion
to
mention
his
talk
with
the
missionary
and
his
own
bit
of
reading
up
on
the
subject
said
he
i
guess
that
man
tanner
was
right
he
did
not
speak
much
of
the
difference
between
the
people
of
one
country
and
those
of
another
which
rather
surprised
me
he
said
nothing
of
the
two
great
classes
the
rulers
with
much
european
blood
and
the
peons
largely
or
altogether
indian
there
must
be
all
sorts
of
latin
americans
rich
and
poor
mixed
blood
of
many
strains
castilian
and
aztec
and
inca
and
whatever
other
people
were
here
when
columbus
set
the
fashion
for
american
voyages
but
this
is
where
this
hit
the
heart
of
the
trouble
latin
america
has
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
but
everywhere
it
has
the
same
church
and
it
is
a
church
that
ca
ever
make
good
any
more
it
might
at
the
beginning
but
it
ca
now
it
has
a
reputation
as
fixed
as
julius
caesar
i
hardly
ready
to
set
up
as
an
expert
observer
being
only
a
cub
salesman
on
his
first
trip
but
drury
i
believe
i
can
see
already
that
the
only
chance
for
these
people
to
get
religion
and
everything
else
which
religion
ought
to
produce
is
for
us
to
send
it
to
them
maybe
that
would
stir
up
the
church
down
here
and
help
to
give
it
another
chance
at
the
confidence
though
i
not
sure
our
church
ought
to
send
doctors
the
amount
of
fearful
disease
that
flourishes
among
the
poorer
people
is
just
frightful
if
joe
carbrook
were
not
so
set
on
going
to
the
orient
he
could
do
a
big
work
here
and
so
could
a
thousand
other
doctors
it
would
be
so
much
more
than
mere
doctoring
it
would
be
the
biggest
kind
of
preaching
and
the
church
should
send
teachers
you
know
i
believe
in
conversion
but
if
the
mexicans
i
have
seen
are
samples
of
latin
america
common
people
they
need
teachers
who
have
the
patience
of
christ
a
good
deal
more
than
they
need
flaming
evangelists
who
make
a
big
stir
and
soon
pass
on
because
these
folks
have
just
to
be
made
over
in
their
very
minds
they
are
not
ready
for
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
until
they
have
seen
it
lived
long
experience
has
made
them
doubtful
of
living
saints
though
plenty
of
them
pray
to
dead
ones
this
is
the
whole
trouble
drury
it
seems
to
me
they
known
only
a
church
that
had
got
off
the
track
any
religious
work
that
reaches
them
now
has
almost
to
begin
all
over
again
it
has
to
undo
their
thinking
about
prayer
and
faith
and
god
love
and
human
conduct
and
nearly
every
other
christian
idea
they
have
a
christian
vocabulary
but
it
means
very
little
they
think
they
can
buy
religion
if
they
want
it
any
kind
they
want
and
if
they
ca
afford
it
or
do
want
it
they
do
quite
think
they
be
sent
to
hell
for
that
in
spite
of
what
the
priest
says
they
think
enough
to
be
afraid
but
not
enough
to
be
sure
of
anything
the
missionaries
have
to
teach
them
a
new
set
of
religious
numerals
if
you
get
what
i
mean
before
it
is
any
use
to
teach
them
the
arithmetic
of
the
gospel
i
beginning
to
see
that
everything
among
the
latin
americans
runs
back
to
the
need
of
christian
living
the
wrong
notion
of
religion
has
got
them
all
twisted
i
know
delafield
is
a
long
way
from
being
christian
but
the
difference
between
delafield
and
such
a
pitiful
mud
village
as
i
seen
lately
has
more
to
do
with
the
sort
of
christianity
each
place
has
been
taught
than
with
anything
else
whatever
but
i
never
thought
of
that
before
as
pastor
drury
read
that
letter
his
heart
warmed
within
him
he
said
to
himself
john
wesley
is
to
see
he
says
please
god
he
mus
stop
now
until
he
gets
his
eyes
wide
open
the
thing
is
working
out
he
groping
around
for
something
and
some
day
he
find
it
chapter
viii
christ
and
the
east
for
a
first
trip
the
southwestern
expedition
under
fred
finch
tutelage
had
been
something
of
an
exploit
finch
report
to
peter
mcdougall
was
more
than
verified
by
the
order
sheets
and
the
observant
peter
keeping
track
of
things
during
the
succeeding
weeks
noticed
with
quiet
satisfaction
that
not
a
single
order
was
canceled
to
himself
he
said
the
lad
a
find
i
thinking
from
finch
talk
i
should
say
he
has
not
only
a
natural
knack
of
selling
but
he
sells
for
keeps
and
that
the
idea
peter
anybody
can
sell
if
the
buyer
means
to
call
off
the
order
by
the
next
mail
this
john
wesley
boy
may
go
far
and
i
have
to
tell
albert
drury
the
next
time
i
see
him
that
done
the
house
of
cummings
a
real
favor
the
months
went
by
kept
his
wits
about
him
and
on
the
road
he
stuck
to
his
salesman
faith
that
goods
are
better
sold
by
those
who
know
exactly
how
they
may
be
used
and
that
they
are
never
sold
until
they
are
bought
so
he
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
peter
mcdougall
the
proof
of
that
is
easy
peter
gave
him
a
week
off
before
the
end
of
his
first
year
delafield
looked
better
to
the
homecoming
salesman
than
it
had
to
the
boy
coming
back
from
college
and
the
town
was
glad
to
see
him
he
meant
something
to
not
a
few
of
its
people
altogether
outside
the
interest
of
the
farwells
and
pastor
drury
and
jeannette
deep
creek
was
his
first
port
of
call
after
his
first
at
home
he
had
been
welcomed
with
deep
quiet
gladness
by
the
home
folks
and
he
had
talked
a
little
over
the
telephone
with
the
preacher
then
time
was
a
laggard
until
he
could
head
the
farwell
car
toward
deep
creek
and
the
old
farm
jeannette
welcome
was
all
that
even
he
could
ask
though
of
course
just
precisely
what
it
was
is
none
of
our
business
in
the
car
and
by
the
fireplace
in
the
shenk
living
room
and
around
the
farm
they
considered
many
things
some
of
them
not
so
personal
as
others
told
the
story
of
his
life
in
saint
louis
and
on
the
road
jeannette
listening
like
another
desdemona
to
the
recital
and
once
again
it
was
not
the
adventure
which
supplied
the
thrill
but
the
adventurer
and
jeannette
told
him
the
news
of
delafield
how
joe
carbrook
and
marcia
dayne
wedding
had
been
the
most
wonderful
wedding
ever
seen
in
delafield
with
the
town
as
proud
of
its
scapegrace
as
it
was
of
the
beautiful
bride
how
brother
marty
had
been
finding
many
excuses
of
late
for
driving
up
from
his
circuit
and
how
he
managed
to
see
alma
wetherell
a
good
deal
how
alma
was
now
head
bookkeeper
and
cashier
of
the
emporium
the
town
biggest
store
and
how
she
was
such
a
dear
girl
how
pastor
drury
and
marty
had
become
great
friends
how
the
minister
was
not
so
well
as
usual
and
people
were
getting
to
be
a
little
worried
about
him
how
the
delafield
church
had
taken
up
tithing
and
was
not
only
doing
a
lot
better
financially
but
in
every
other
way
how
deep
creek
was
going
to
have
a
new
minister
a
friend
whom
marty
had
met
at
the
summer
school
for
rural
ministers
who
would
try
to
help
the
deep
creek
people
get
an
church
building
and
learn
to
use
it
how
the
everyday
doctrines
of
delafield
had
been
first
boosted
and
then
forgotten
and
now
again
several
of
them
were
being
practiced
in
some
quarters
and
much
more
though
never
to
the
wearing
out
of
interest
certainly
not
the
news
being
just
what
he
wanted
to
know
and
the
reporter
thereof
being
just
the
person
he
wanted
to
tell
it
to
him
one
bit
of
news
jeannette
did
not
tell
for
the
sufficient
reason
that
she
did
not
know
it
pastor
drury
and
brother
marty
become
great
friends
but
what
jeannette
could
not
tell
was
the
special
bond
of
interest
which
was
back
of
the
fact
marty
had
long
been
aware
that
for
some
reason
the
delafield
pastor
was
peculiarly
concerned
about
never
did
he
guess
walter
drury
secret
but
he
knew
well
enough
there
was
one
these
two
the
town
preacher
and
the
young
circuit
rider
read
to
each
other
letters
and
talked
much
about
him
and
his
experiences
and
made
in
general
the
theme
of
many
discussions
it
has
been
good
for
the
boy
that
he
has
had
that
border
trip
said
the
pastor
to
marty
a
few
days
before
got
back
do
you
think
so
marty
was
as
ever
ardent
and
chum
i
certainly
do
he
said
he
growing
is
and
growing
the
right
way
we
need
business
men
of
just
the
quality
that
showing
in
him
the
pastor
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
spoke
marty
when
comes
home
i
hope
something
will
set
him
thinking
about
the
outer
world
that
has
no
word
of
our
christ
he
has
seen
it
yet
not
clearly
and
you
know
that
there
is
any
hope
for
that
world
to
get
out
of
the
depths
until
it
gets
the
news
of
a
helper
i
counting
on
you
to
help
me
with
if
the
chance
comes
just
between
ourselves
you
know
i
do
all
i
can
drury
you
may
be
sure
of
that
said
marty
and
he
did
holiday
brought
several
young
people
together
who
had
not
met
for
a
long
time
marty
came
up
again
and
spent
the
day
with
all
over
town
from
the
store
to
the
house
and
back
again
in
the
evening
farwell
made
a
feast
to
which
besides
marty
jeannette
and
alma
and
pastor
drury
were
bidden
farwell
was
much
more
to
delafield
than
the
best
cook
and
the
most
remarkable
housekeeper
in
the
place
but
her
son
insisted
that
she
was
these
to
begin
with
certainly
she
had
not
been
experimenting
on
the
two
all
these
years
for
nothing
after
dinner
talk
no
need
of
any
other
game
in
that
company
at
such
a
time
there
was
plenty
to
talk
about
and
all
had
their
reasons
for
enjoying
it
naturally
must
tell
about
himself
letters
are
all
very
well
but
they
are
no
more
than
makeshifts
after
all
he
was
modest
enough
about
it
not
having
any
special
exploits
to
parade
before
their
wondering
eyes
but
quite
willing
his
western
experiences
being
called
for
he
was
soon
telling
not
of
desert
and
cactus
and
irrigation
but
of
the
people
who
had
so
taken
his
attention
the
mexicans
i
believe
said
he
that
we
can
do
something
really
big
down
there
and
it
our
business
nobody
except
american
christians
will
do
it
nobody
else
can
besides
the
mexicans
are
christians
in
name
now
what
they
need
is
the
reality
they
are
not
impossible
just
uncertain
all
i
heard
and
what
little
i
saw
made
me
believe
they
are
suffering
from
bad
leadership
and
ignorance
more
than
from
anything
hopelessly
wrong
they
seem
easy
to
get
along
with
the
women
are
the
most
patient
workers
i
ever
heard
of
and
the
poor
mexicans
the
do
want
an
end
to
fighting
and
banditry
well
marty
asked
what
the
first
thing
we
ought
to
think
about
for
mexico
i
told
you
i
do
know
anything
about
mexico
except
at
but
i
should
say
schools
schools
are
good
for
any
land
do
you
think
drury
and
in
mexico
they
are
such
great
disturbers
of
the
old
slouching
indifference
they
will
make
the
right
kind
of
discontent
schools
bring
other
things
new
ideas
of
health
and
sanitation
home
improvement
social
outlook
and
all
that
then
with
the
schools
i
guess
the
straight
gospel
the
mexicans
wo
get
converted
all
at
once
and
they
wo
become
like
us
ever
but
about
ready
to
say
that
whether
missions
are
needed
anywhere
else
or
not
they
surely
are
needed
in
mexico
and
mexico
is
the
first
to
south
america
which
is
next
on
my
list
of
the
places
that
ought
to
have
the
whole
scheme
of
christian
teaching
and
life
yes
said
alma
and
you
know
i
suppose
that
the
beginning
of
our
panama
mission
was
an
epworth
league
institute
enterprise
well
it
was
california
young
people
assumed
the
support
of
the
first
missionary
sent
there
and
later
he
went
on
down
to
south
america
with
the
same
young
people
determined
to
take
him
on
as
their
representative
just
as
they
did
in
panama
where
did
you
get
that
story
wanted
to
know
oh
i
forgot
alma
answered
him
laughing
you
have
had
time
to
read
the
epworth
herald
in
saint
louis
yes
i
have
young
lady
retorted
but
i
missed
that
anyway
it
on
the
right
track
i
think
we
got
to
change
the
thinking
of
all
latin
america
about
christianity
if
we
can
most
of
the
men
they
say
are
atheists
made
so
very
largely
by
their
loss
of
faith
in
the
church
and
many
of
the
women
substitute
an
almost
fierce
devotion
to
the
same
church
for
what
we
think
of
as
being
genuine
religion
the
minister
spoke
up
just
here
i
should
think
it
would
be
pretty
difficult
to
treat
our
united
states
mexicans
in
one
way
and
those
across
the
rio
grande
in
another
we
must
evangelize
on
both
sides
of
the
river
but
only
on
this
side
can
we
even
attempt
to
americanize
that
right
affirmed
and
even
on
this
side
we
ca
do
what
we
may
do
in
delafield
the
language
is
a
big
question
and
it
has
two
sides
but
no
matter
what
the
difficulties
i
for
a
great
advance
of
missions
and
education
starting
with
mexico
and
going
all
the
way
to
cape
horn
that
all
very
fine
interposed
marty
but
what
about
the
rest
of
the
world
what
about
the
world
that
has
not
even
the
beginning
of
christian
knowledge
marty
had
put
the
question
on
the
urge
of
the
moment
and
not
until
it
was
out
did
he
remember
that
drury
had
asked
him
to
help
raise
this
very
issue
well
answered
slowly
maybe
that
part
of
the
world
is
worse
though
i
do
know
but
we
ca
tackle
everything
latin
america
is
an
immense
job
by
itself
and
we
have
some
real
responsibility
there
a
sort
of
christian
monroe
doctrine
ought
we
to
scatter
our
forces
the
world
has
its
own
religions
and
has
had
them
for
hundreds
maybe
thousands
of
years
what
the
hurry
just
now
if
we
could
do
everything
we
protestant
christians
i
mean
in
this
country
and
britain
it
might
be
different
but
we
ca
why
not
concentrate
yes
marty
came
back
but
not
because
latin
america
is
so
nearly
christian
what
about
this
atheism
and
superstition
and
ignorance
it
just
a
civilization
with
christian
labels
on
some
parts
of
it
one
thing
i
heard
put
in
jeannette
not
that
she
wanted
to
argue
but
she
felt
she
ought
to
say
something
on
side
if
she
could
that
the
religions
of
the
orient
at
least
are
really
great
religions
more
suited
to
the
minds
of
the
people
than
any
other
is
east
and
west
is
west
you
know
but
of
course
the
people
do
live
up
to
the
high
levels
of
their
beliefs
americans
do
either
drury
shot
an
amused
yet
admiring
glance
at
jeannette
what
a
loyal
soul
she
was
then
said
he
the
religions
of
the
east
great
religions
jeannette
they
represent
the
best
that
men
can
do
the
orient
has
a
genius
for
religion
and
it
has
produced
far
better
systems
than
the
west
could
have
done
some
of
the
truth
that
we
western
people
get
only
in
christianity
the
thinkers
of
asia
worked
out
for
themselves
but
god
was
back
of
it
all
that
suited
present
mood
all
right
then
let
clean
up
as
we
go
delafield
saint
louis
the
southwest
mexico
latin
america
the
logical
order
then
the
rest
of
the
world
marty
put
in
a
protest
here
that
wo
do
old
man
your
logic
lame
you
want
us
to
go
into
mexico
now
with
all
we
got
your
letters
have
said
so
and
you
said
it
again
but
we
not
up
as
we
go
look
at
delafield
the
town
you
moved
away
from
look
at
saint
louis
the
town
where
you
make
your
living
are
they
christianized
cleaned
up
yet
you
are
ready
for
mexico
no
you
all
wrong
i
do
believe
the
world
going
to
be
saved
the
way
you
break
up
prairie
sod
a
field
at
a
time
and
let
the
rest
alone
got
to
do
our
missionary
work
the
way
they
feed
famine
sufferers
they
do
give
any
applicant
all
he
can
eat
but
they
try
to
make
the
supply
go
giving
each
one
a
little
remember
the
rest
of
the
world
is
as
human
as
our
western
hemisphere
i
know
admitted
and
i
do
say
i
got
the
right
of
it
have
to
see
the
orient
before
i
made
up
my
mind
but
those
countries
have
waited
a
long
while
a
few
more
years
would
be
any
great
matter
alma
wetherell
now
joined
the
opposition
it
looked
as
though
and
jeannette
must
stand
alone
for
the
old
people
said
nothing
though
they
listened
with
eager
ears
said
alma
i
think
it
would
matter
a
lot
the
more
we
do
for
one
people
while
ignoring
all
the
others
the
less
we
should
care
to
drop
a
developing
work
to
begin
at
the
bottom
somewhere
else
there
something
in
that
conceded
i
not
meaning
to
be
stubborn
but
i
had
just
a
glimpse
of
the
size
of
the
missionary
job
in
one
little
corner
of
the
world
even
that
is
too
big
for
us
we
could
put
our
whole
missionary
investment
into
mexico
without
being
able
to
do
what
is
needed
the
missionary
job
as
you
call
it
is
too
big
certainly
for
our
present
resources
said
the
pastor
everybody
knows
that
yes
said
marty
who
wondered
if
drury
had
forgotten
their
compact
about
but
why
limit
ourselves
to
our
present
resources
they
are
not
all
we
could
get
if
the
church
came
to
believe
in
the
bigness
of
her
privilege
i
like
to
see
for
myself
as
says
but
i
ca
why
do
you
get
a
real
traveling
job
and
go
about
the
world
looking
things
over
for
us
old
man
me
said
sarcastically
yes
that
a
likely
prospect
just
as
i
getting
over
being
scared
by
a
sample
case
i
do
well
to
hold
the
job
i
got
alma
did
know
what
marty
game
was
but
she
played
up
to
his
suggestion
why
should
you
go
she
asked
you
told
us
that
cummings
hardware
and
tools
are
sold
all
over
the
world
does
that
mean
salesmen
and
are
you
a
salesman
they
have
to
send
somebody
why
should
they
pick
on
you
some
time
rose
to
the
lure
for
the
moment
all
salesman
nothing
in
it
alma
no
chance
at
all
but
i
would
like
to
show
the
world
the
civilizing
values
of
good
tools
and
i
go
if
i
got
the
chance
jeannette
reaction
was
quicker
than
thinking
would
you
go
half
way
around
the
world
just
for
that
she
asked
with
a
hint
of
alarm
why
yes
i
would
said
that
is
if
you
were
willing
whereupon
everybody
laughed
but
jeannette
whose
pale
cheeks
flamed
into
sudden
rosiness
the
minister
came
to
her
rescue
it
would
be
a
good
thing
every
way
if
more
laymen
would
see
the
realities
of
oriental
life
and
bring
back
an
impartial
report
suppose
you
should
be
right
and
we
found
that
the
orient
could
wait
until
the
western
hemisphere
had
been
thoroughly
christianized
think
how
many
thousands
perhaps
millions
of
dollars
could
be
directed
into
more
productive
channels
i
can
see
what
a
great
influence
such
reports
would
have
if
they
came
from
christian
laymen
we
have
learned
to
expect
stories
of
complete
failure
when
the
ordinary
traveler
comes
back
and
maybe
the
missionaries
have
their
bias
too
but
business
men
with
christian
ideals
that
would
be
different
now
all
this
was
far
from
unpleasant
to
he
detested
posing
but
why
would
it
be
worth
something
to
have
laymen
report
on
missionary
work
of
course
though
if
the
time
ever
came
when
the
firm
was
willing
to
trust
him
abroad
he
would
have
much
chance
to
study
missions
business
would
have
to
come
first
it
was
no
less
a
dream
for
being
an
agreeable
one
there
no
danger
of
my
going
he
told
them
the
cummings
people
are
not
sending
cub
salesmen
to
promote
their
big
asiatic
trade
what
could
they
make
by
it
then
the
talk
drifted
to
the
carbrooks
marty
said
well
we
spoiled
your
scheme
a
little
right
here
in
delafield
joe
carbrook
and
marcia
are
in
china
by
now
and
i
like
to
see
both
of
as
they
get
down
to
work
you
ca
keep
all
our
interest
on
this
side
of
the
pacific
so
long
as
those
two
are
on
the
other
no
said
warmly
and
i
do
want
to
i
help
to
back
up
those
two
missionaries
wherever
they
go
and
his
thoughts
went
back
to
camp
fire
night
at
cartwright
institute
when
he
had
said
to
joe
carbrook
without
suspecting
the
consequences
say
joe
if
you
think
you
could
be
a
doctor
why
not
a
missionary
doctor
then
he
asked
the
company
just
where
have
these
missionary
infants
been
sent
nobody
knew
exactly
they
had
the
name
of
the
town
and
the
province
but
the
geography
of
china
is
not
as
yet
familiar
even
to
those
who
support
the
missions
and
missionaries
of
that
vast
mysterious
land
the
pastor
thought
it
was
two
or
three
hundred
miles
inland
from
foochow
anyhow
said
he
it
is
a
town
of
about
one
hundred
thousand
people
or
more
and
joe
hospital
is
the
only
one
in
the
whole
district
the
man
whose
place
he
takes
is
home
on
furlough
and
i
looked
up
his
work
in
the
annual
report
of
the
foreign
missions
board
six
or
eight
years
ago
the
hospital
was
a
building
of
brick
with
a
mud
floor
and
accommodations
for
about
patients
he
was
running
it
on
something
like
five
dollars
a
day
but
it
is
better
now
costs
more
too
and
there
a
school
attached
where
marcia
has
already
begun
to
make
herself
necessary
or
i
much
mistaken
so
the
talk
ran
on
until
the
evening
was
far
spent
and
everybody
wished
there
could
be
half
a
dozen
such
evenings
before
must
go
back
to
saint
louis
and
the
road
no
other
opportunity
offered
however
and
all
too
soon
for
some
people
was
gone
again
from
delafield
walter
drury
seeing
his
chance
set
himself
to
follow
up
the
talk
of
that
one
evening
it
had
given
him
a
lead
as
to
the
next
phase
of
the
experiment
and
he
wanted
to
try
out
the
idea
before
anything
else
might
happen
so
he
wrote
to
his
brother
albert
in
saint
louis
i
know
i
a
bother
to
you
the
letter
ran
but
you
have
always
been
generous
being
your
own
unselfish
self
it
about
young
farwell
wesley
you
know
i
judge
he
a
boy
with
a
fine
business
future
and
i
found
out
from
his
father
some
of
the
reasons
why
he
is
making
good
now
i
know
much
about
business
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
qualities
which
make
a
good
salesman
for
a
beginner
would
be
profitable
to
his
company
if
they
sent
him
to
their
oriental
trade
he
young
enough
to
learn
something
over
there
my
own
interest
is
not
on
that
side
of
the
affair
but
i
know
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
to
suggest
his
going
unless
the
cummings
people
could
see
a
business
advantage
in
it
if
you
think
it
is
not
asking
too
much
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
mcdougall
about
it
tell
him
what
i
have
written
and
what
i
told
you
long
ago
about
albert
drury
had
unbounded
confidence
in
his
brother
sincerity
and
sense
so
he
lost
no
time
in
getting
an
interview
with
his
friend
mcdougall
see
here
peter
said
he
i
be
frank
with
you
i
know
you
think
i
better
be
if
i
to
get
anywhere
that
very
true
said
mcdougall
with
assumed
severity
well
then
read
my
brother
letter
and
then
tell
me
if
he
wanting
the
impossible
peter
mcdougall
read
the
letter
twice
no
he
said
when
he
handed
it
back
he
not
wanting
the
impossible
he
given
me
an
idea
i
owe
you
something
already
for
finding
this
young
fellow
and
i
tell
you
what
i
thinking
of
of
course
the
boy
is
seasoned
enough
yet
but
getting
there
fast
a
couple
of
long
trips
a
few
months
under
my
own
eye
here
in
the
office
and
he
be
ready
now
your
brother
has
hinted
at
exactly
what
young
farwell
is
good
for
that
boy
sells
goods
by
getting
over
onto
the
buyer
side
and
he
knows
tools
knew
before
we
hired
him
well
then
here
the
idea
one
big
need
of
our
foreign
trade
is
to
show
our
agencies
what
can
really
be
done
with
american
hardware
and
tools
it
takes
more
than
a
salesman
and
farwell
has
the
knack
so
there
you
are
tell
your
brother
the
boy
shall
have
his
chance
a
few
months
later
mcdougall
sent
for
and
put
the
whole
proposal
before
him
but
i
not
an
expert
mcdougall
protested
i
have
the
experience
and
i
might
fall
down
completely
in
a
new
field
like
that
we
not
looking
for
an
expert
said
mcdougall
shortly
you
know
what
every
user
of
our
stuff
ought
to
know
you
can
put
yourself
in
his
place
and
you
be
a
sort
of
missionary
how
about
it
at
the
word
memory
awoke
and
he
heard
again
what
had
been
said
in
the
living
room
at
delafield
when
he
was
last
at
home
a
missionary
and
here
was
the
very
chance
they
had
all
talked
about
of
course
i
should
like
to
go
if
you
think
i
do
he
said
peter
looked
at
him
more
kindly
than
was
his
wont
my
boy
he
said
i
know
something
about
you
outside
of
business
though
not
much
and
i
think
you
do
mind
you
your
missionary
work
will
be
tools
and
hardware
not
the
methodist
church
you
will
have
to
show
people
who
have
their
own
ideas
about
tools
how
much
more
convenient
our
goods
are
handier
lighter
more
adaptable
what
they
need
over
there
is
modern
stuff
it
will
help
them
to
raise
more
crops
and
do
better
work
and
earn
a
better
income
you
nothing
to
do
with
selling
policies
finance
credits
and
all
that
just
be
a
tool
and
hardware
missionary
where
had
you
thought
of
sending
me
asked
still
somewhat
dazed
oh
wherever
we
have
agencies
that
you
can
use
as
bases
china
the
philippines
malaysia
india
you
will
have
to
figure
on
a
year
or
nearly
that
and
you
must
stick
to
the
ports
or
the
big
cities
get
hold
of
people
who
show
you
the
country
the
places
where
our
goods
are
most
needed
and
least
known
study
the
people
and
their
tools
work
out
better
ways
of
doing
things
do
try
to
hustle
the
east
but
remember
that
the
east
is
doing
a
little
hustling
on
its
own
account
these
days
and
talk
turkey
to
our
agencies
when
you
sure
you
have
something
to
talk
about
the
rest
is
detail
the
trip
determined
on
preparations
were
hastened
a
month
before
the
date
of
starting
had
time
for
no
more
than
a
hurried
visit
to
delafield
to
say
to
the
home
folk
and
to
the
preacher
whom
he
had
come
to
think
of
as
timothy
might
have
thought
of
paul
then
he
had
something
else
to
say
to
jeannette
his
prospects
were
becoming
so
promising
that
he
could
ask
her
a
very
definite
question
and
he
dared
to
hope
for
a
definite
answer
jeannette
troubled
at
the
thought
of
his
long
absence
in
strange
lands
consoled
herself
by
her
promise
which
was
his
promise
also
as
soon
as
he
came
home
again
they
would
be
married
brother
drury
should
officiate
assisted
by
the
rev
martin
luther
shenk
brother
of
the
charming
bride
as
put
it
walter
drury
was
not
his
usual
alert
self
thought
and
it
hurt
him
to
see
his
friend
touched
even
a
little
by
the
years
but
the
pastor
brightened
up
and
grew
visibly
better
as
told
him
all
his
plans
just
think
drury
he
said
with
animation
i
to
be
a
missionary
after
all
once
long
ago
i
remember
you
suggested
i
might
go
to
china
and
see
for
myself
the
difference
between
their
religion
and
ours
and
now
i
going
to
china
who
knows
maybe
i
see
joe
carbrook
at
his
work
and
then
i
to
go
all
over
the
east
to
preach
the
gospel
of
better
tools
then
he
became
thoughtful
do
you
think
almost
as
good
as
the
gospel
of
better
bodies
joe
gospel
surely
i
do
said
the
pastor
if
you
and
joe
preach
in
the
same
spirit
knowing
that
china
wo
be
saved
even
by
hospitals
and
modern
hardware
they
help
but
remember
our
understanding
you
have
your
chance
now
to
see
the
religions
of
the
east
going
right
among
the
people
as
you
will
you
can
find
out
more
in
a
week
than
the
average
tourist
ever
discovers
i
give
you
the
names
of
some
people
who
will
gladly
help
you
and
we
shall
want
a
full
report
when
you
come
back
god
bless
you
it
was
a
tired
preacher
who
went
to
bed
that
night
this
new
adventure
of
his
boy
what
would
it
mean
to
the
experiment
he
had
done
his
best
to
keep
that
pledge
to
himself
not
always
had
the
project
been
easy
he
could
not
control
all
its
circumstances
but
in
the
main
it
had
gone
well
and
now
was
in
the
last
stage
of
the
experiment
walter
drury
had
contrived
to
shape
its
larger
conditions
with
the
help
of
many
friendly
but
unsuspecting
conspirators
this
tour
in
the
interest
of
better
tools
was
due
mainly
to
his
initiative
but
he
could
do
nothing
more
the
event
was
now
out
of
his
hands
the
relaxed
tension
made
him
realize
that
his
nerves
were
shaky
and
he
had
a
sense
of
great
depression
but
before
he
went
to
bed
he
pulled
himself
together
long
enough
to
write
to
five
missionaries
including
joe
carbrook
whose
fields
were
on
or
near
the
route
would
travel
he
had
told
that
he
would
let
these
men
know
of
his
coming
but
he
did
more
to
each
one
he
said
a
word
of
appeal
do
argue
much
with
this
boy
of
mine
i
want
him
to
see
it
without
too
many
opinions
explain
all
you
please
and
let
him
get
as
near
as
he
can
to
the
people
you
are
dealing
with
if
as
i
hope
he
gets
a
glimpse
of
the
work
inner
meaning
i
shall
be
satisfied
the
first
day
which
spent
in
shanghai
was
a
big
day
for
him
even
amid
the
strangeness
of
the
scene
he
felt
almost
at
home
the
people
who
had
the
cummings
agency
had
received
their
instructions
and
were
prepared
to
help
him
every
way
he
could
begin
an
trip
at
once
if
he
wished
then
he
met
the
first
of
the
men
to
whom
pastor
drury
had
written
mark
rutledge
and
at
once
he
saw
that
this
alert
young
missionary
who
used
modern
speech
in
deliberate
but
direct
fashion
would
be
of
immense
service
to
him
rutledge
received
gospel
of
tools
with
almost
boyish
enthusiasm
i
always
said
he
exclaimed
that
if
the
other
business
men
of
america
had
as
much
sense
as
the
tobacco
folks
they
would
hasten
the
christianizing
of
china
by
many
a
year
not
that
tobacco
is
helping
far
from
it
but
it
the
idea
of
fitting
their
product
to
this
particular
market
and
your
house
has
evidently
caught
that
idea
you
must
have
a
real
sales
manager
in
saint
louis
of
course
i
help
you
all
i
can
some
of
the
help
which
mark
rutledge
gave
him
was
of
a
sort
that
could
not
rightly
estimate
at
the
time
but
he
knew
it
was
good
as
long
as
he
stayed
in
shanghai
and
as
often
he
came
back
to
the
city
as
a
base
he
and
rutledge
were
pretty
frequently
together
the
missionary
kept
his
own
counsel
as
to
the
drury
letter
merely
dropping
a
hint
now
and
then
or
a
suggestion
which
fitted
both
the
cummings
program
and
the
pastor
desire
the
inland
trips
for
business
purposes
kept
busy
for
weeks
he
found
himself
in
so
utterly
novel
a
situation
that
he
saw
he
could
not
work
out
anything
without
careful
study
and
expert
chinese
cooperation
as
he
came
and
went
he
saw
under
rutledge
guidance
much
of
the
inside
of
mission
work
in
shanghai
he
found
a
methodist
publishing
house
sending
out
literature
all
over
china
as
well
as
two
monthly
papers
one
in
chinese
and
one
in
english
many
missionary
boards
had
headquarters
here
from
shanghai
as
a
business
center
every
form
of
missionary
work
was
being
promoted
reaching
as
far
as
the
foothills
of
the
thibetan
plateau
hospital
equipment
was
distributed
and
school
equipment
and
supplies
of
every
variety
he
saw
that
it
was
the
financial
center
too
and
mission
finance
is
a
special
science
shanghai
seemed
to
to
be
one
of
the
great
capitals
of
the
missionary
world
rutledge
own
work
many
sided
as
saw
it
was
had
two
aspects
of
special
significance
rutledge
was
sending
back
to
america
all
the
information
he
could
gather
from
the
whole
field
with
the
skill
of
a
trained
reporter
he
showed
the
missionaries
how
to
write
so
as
to
make
a
genuine
story
seem
convincing
and
how
to
subordinate
the
details
to
the
importance
of
making
a
clear
and
single
impression
the
other
work
of
rutledge
which
caught
eye
was
his
activity
in
behalf
of
the
young
people
of
china
until
lately
nothing
at
all
had
been
done
comparable
to
the
specialized
development
of
young
work
in
america
but
now
the
epworth
league
was
beginning
to
be
utilized
and
adapted
to
chinese
ways
funds
were
available
not
much
but
a
beginning
leaders
were
being
trained
a
larger
measure
of
local
chinese
help
was
being
employed
asked
mark
rutledge
about
all
this
one
day
is
it
going
to
make
a
difference
with
the
work
by
and
by
if
you
get
so
many
natives
into
places
of
responsibility
are
they
ready
for
it
no
said
rutledge
they
not
but
we
must
make
them
ready
you
have
begun
to
see
china
yet
but
already
you
can
see
that
the
country
could
never
be
even
in
the
narrowest
use
of
that
word
by
foreign
missionaries
and
it
ought
not
to
be
you
mean
that
we
americans
ought
to
consider
our
work
in
china
as
temporary
asked
rutledge
answered
frankly
i
do
if
you
let
me
put
my
own
meaning
into
we
must
start
things
and
much
that
must
be
done
in
the
long
run
has
not
yet
been
started
we
must
stay
here
beyond
my
life
expectation
or
yours
but
china
will
be
christianized
by
the
chinese
not
by
foreigners
as
far
ahead
as
we
can
see
the
work
will
have
help
from
outside
but
i
honestly
want
the
time
to
come
when
we
missionaries
will
be
looked
upon
as
the
foreign
helpers
of
the
chinese
church
not
as
now
controlling
the
work
ourselves
and
enlisting
the
services
of
helpers
then
tell
me
another
thing
persisted
is
our
christianity
as
the
chinese
get
it
any
advance
on
their
own
religion
or
is
their
religion
all
right
if
they
would
work
it
as
we
hope
they
may
work
the
christian
program
that
two
questions
said
rutledge
dryly
but
after
all
it
is
only
one
our
christianity
as
the
chinese
get
it
is
far
ahead
of
the
best
they
have
in
ideals
in
human
values
everything
even
if
they
were
more
consistent
in
responding
to
its
claims
than
christians
are
the
old
religions
and
china
has
several
are
helpless
we
are
not
killing
off
the
old
faiths
if
we
should
get
out
these
would
none
the
less
die
out
in
time
but
then
china
would
be
left
without
any
religion
at
all
instead
she
going
to
have
the
christian
faith
in
a
form
that
will
accord
with
the
genius
of
the
chinese
mind
that
my
sure
confidence
or
i
would
be
here
it
was
necessary
that
should
run
down
the
coast
to
foochow
the
base
for
his
next
operations
in
the
hardware
adventure
i
know
green
he
said
to
rutledge
and
i
may
be
thinking
of
impossibilities
but
do
you
suppose
there
be
any
chance
for
me
to
get
up
to
carbrook
place
from
foochow
i
told
you
about
him
and
his
wife
and
i
rather
see
those
two
than
anybody
else
in
all
the
east
it
not
impossible
at
all
rutledge
assured
him
carbrook
post
is
not
so
very
far
from
foochow
as
distances
go
in
china
and
ralph
bellew
at
the
college
will
help
you
yes
my
pastor
at
home
told
me
to
be
sure
and
call
on
him
said
and
took
his
leave
of
a
man
he
would
long
remember
the
call
of
professor
bellew
was
not
delayed
long
after
had
found
his
bearings
in
foochow
and
the
professor
welcome
was
even
more
cordial
than
that
of
the
cummings
agency
though
these
gentlemen
were
of
course
the
soul
of
courtesy
if
they
were
not
so
sure
as
peter
mcdougall
that
or
any
other
american
could
teach
them
anything
about
selling
the
cummings
line
in
china
at
least
they
would
not
put
anything
in
his
way
one
important
interior
town
yenping
they
had
hoped
might
visit
but
unfortunately
there
was
no
one
connected
with
the
agency
who
could
be
sent
with
him
they
understood
that
some
of
his
missionary
friends
were
ready
to
help
him
in
the
general
enterprise
and
perhaps
they
might
be
able
to
suggest
something
when
the
difficulty
was
stated
to
professor
bellew
he
said
why
one
of
our
stations
it
is
a
little
out
of
the
way
to
go
up
to
carbrook
place
on
the
way
to
yenping
but
we
see
that
you
get
to
both
towns
that
certainly
good
of
you
professor
said
gratefully
told
you
about
joe
carbrook
and
i
can
hardly
wait
until
i
get
to
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
told
everybody
about
joe
carbrook
professor
bellew
was
sympathetic
i
know
he
said
and
i
understand
when
you
come
back
if
we
can
manage
the
dates
you
may
find
something
here
which
you
ought
to
see
the
carbrook
hospital
it
has
another
name
in
the
annual
reports
but
this
will
identify
it
sufficiently
for
our
purposes
spread
itself
all
over
the
compound
and
beyond
in
its
welcome
to
joe
and
marcia
were
first
and
joyfullest
the
school
turned
out
to
the
last
scholar
and
even
the
hospital
walking
cases
insisted
on
having
a
share
in
the
welcome
to
the
foreign
doctor
friend
tell
us
what
you
are
up
to
said
the
carbrooks
when
they
were
back
in
the
house
after
a
sketchy
inspection
of
the
whole
establishment
hospital
dispensary
school
chapel
and
so
forth
and
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
with
it
now
that
you
have
the
hospital
you
have
been
dreaming
about
so
long
said
but
told
his
story
first
just
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
as
he
said
then
he
turned
to
marcia
and
said
how
about
it
carbrook
well
said
marcia
that
name
is
not
so
strange
as
it
was
feeling
as
if
i
had
been
married
a
long
time
judging
by
the
responsibilities
that
are
dumped
on
me
just
because
i
am
the
wife
and
this
doctor
man
of
mine
hardly
knows
whether
to
be
happy
or
miserable
he
happy
because
he
has
found
the
very
place
he
wanted
and
he
miserable
because
he
ought
to
be
learning
the
language
and
ca
get
away
from
the
work
that
crowds
in
on
him
and
you
yourself
marcia
asked
are
you
happy
or
miserable
or
both
she
as
mixed
up
as
i
am
old
man
joe
answered
for
her
talk
about
the
language
i
do
hanker
after
learning
it
but
i
got
to
some
time
if
they
would
just
let
me
be
a
sort
of
doctor
i
be
much
obliged
the
work
is
fairly
maddening
you
know
it
was
a
question
of
closing
up
this
hospital
or
putting
me
in
as
a
green
hand
of
course
there
are
the
nurses
and
a
couple
of
students
but
i
glad
they
put
me
in
only
look
at
the
job
never
a
day
without
new
patients
a
steady
stream
at
the
why
i
done
operations
alone
here
that
at
home
they
hardly
let
me
hold
sponges
for
had
to
do
well
commented
is
that
what
you
came
for
it
is
marcia
answered
these
two
had
a
queer
way
of
speaking
for
each
other
and
it
would
be
a
good
plenty
if
the
hospital
were
all
but
we
are
putting
up
a
new
building
to
take
the
place
of
an
adobe
horror
and
joe
has
to
buy
bricks
and
deal
with
workmen
and
give
advice
and
dispense
medicine
and
do
operations
all
with
the
help
of
a
none
too
sure
interpreter
he
the
busiest
man
i
do
believe
between
here
and
foochow
wanted
to
draw
joe
out
about
the
work
in
general
what
of
the
evangelistic
work
and
the
educational
work
and
all
the
rest
but
joe
would
not
rise
to
it
i
tell
you
honestly
i
just
do
know
have
had
time
to
find
out
when
i
got
here
i
found
people
standing
three
deep
around
the
hospital
doors
some
wanting
help
for
themselves
and
some
anxious
to
bring
relatives
or
friends
i
was
at
work
before
anything
was
unpacked
except
my
instruments
and
i
been
at
it
ever
since
everything
else
could
wait
but
all
this
human
misery
could
and
i
do
know
much
of
what
the
evangelistic
value
of
it
all
will
be
we
have
a
bible
woman
and
a
teacher
in
the
school
who
are
very
devoted
they
read
and
pray
every
day
with
the
patients
and
as
for
gratitude
i
never
expected
to
be
thanked
for
what
i
did
as
i
have
been
thanked
here
i
tell
you
one
thing
i
did
dream
a
man
could
be
so
content
in
the
midst
of
such
a
hurricane
of
work
i
done
to
a
standstill
every
day
i
bump
into
difficulties
and
tackle
responsibilities
that
i
had
even
heard
of
in
medical
school
though
i
have
killed
anybody
yet
and
all
the
time
i
remember
how
i
used
to
wish
i
might
be
the
only
doctor
between
siam
and
sunrise
i
plenty
near
enough
to
that
in
all
conscience
the
only
doctor
in
this
town
of
one
hundred
thousand
and
a
district
around
us
so
big
that
i
afraid
to
measure
it
on
one
side
the
next
doctor
is
a
good
hundred
miles
away
now
do
you
know
how
i
feel
oh
yes
insufficient
until
it
hurts
like
the
toothache
yet
somehow
as
though
i
were
carrying
on
here
not
in
place
of
the
man
who
has
gone
home
on
furlough
but
in
place
of
jesus
christ
himself
you
know
i
not
irreverent
i
might
have
been
but
this
has
taken
all
of
the
temptation
out
of
me
it
is
his
work
not
mine
turned
to
marcia
again
i
thought
you
said
this
joe
of
yours
was
miserable
i
seen
him
when
he
was
enjoying
himself
pretty
well
but
i
never
saw
him
like
this
i
know
marcia
admitted
and
i
did
mean
he
was
really
unhappy
but
it
is
a
big
strain
and
there
no
sign
of
its
letting
up
until
the
regular
doctor
gets
back
the
next
day
watched
his
old
friend
amid
the
press
of
duties
which
crowded
the
hours
and
he
marveled
as
much
as
the
wretchedness
of
the
patients
as
he
did
at
the
steady
resourcefulness
of
the
man
whom
he
had
known
when
he
was
delafield
adventurous
and
spendthrift
idler
as
he
looked
on
could
understand
something
which
had
been
a
closed
book
to
him
before
no
one
could
stand
by
and
see
this
abjectness
of
need
this
helplessness
this
pathetic
faith
which
was
almost
fatalistic
in
the
foreign
doctor
miraculous
powers
it
recalled
that
beseeching
cry
in
the
new
testament
story
lord
if
thou
thou
without
being
deeply
poignantly
glad
that
there
were
such
men
as
joe
carbrook
it
was
all
very
well
to
talk
at
long
range
about
letting
china
and
other
places
wait
but
on
the
spot
nobody
could
talk
that
way
the
visit
might
have
lasted
two
weeks
instead
of
two
days
and
then
the
carbrooks
would
have
hung
on
and
besought
him
to
stay
a
little
longer
torture
would
not
have
drawn
any
admission
from
them
but
back
of
all
the
joy
in
the
work
was
a
something
that
left
them
without
words
as
and
his
little
group
from
foochow
set
out
for
the
next
stopping
place
just
before
the
last
silent
told
his
friends
about
jeannette
and
himself
and
promised
joe
a
wedding
present
you
see
he
said
i
never
sent
you
one
when
you
were
married
and
i
like
to
send
you
a
double
one
now
for
yourselves
and
for
us
you
send
me
word
what
it
is
you
most
need
for
the
hospital
an
outfit
or
a
sterilizer
or
a
thingamajig
for
making
cultures
microscope
included
and
jeannette
and
i
will
see
that
you
get
it
i
a
tither
you
know
and
my
been
raised
and
i
want
to
do
something
to
show
what
a
fool
i
was
before
i
knew
what
sort
of
a
business
you
were
really
in
out
here
so
do
be
modest
you
ca
hurt
my
feelings
back
at
foochow
in
the
course
of
the
slow
days
which
chinese
travel
gives
to
those
who
go
aside
from
the
beaten
path
professor
bellew
welcomed
with
eager
warmth
you
back
just
in
time
if
you
can
stay
a
few
days
the
celebration
of
the
fortieth
anniversary
of
the
college
begins
had
at
least
a
week
business
with
the
cummings
agents
he
had
found
some
conditions
on
his
inland
journey
which
called
for
much
discussion
so
he
had
time
for
sharing
in
a
good
deal
of
the
celebration
it
was
something
to
marvel
at
that
a
christian
college
had
been
at
work
in
this
great
city
for
forty
years
the
president
of
the
college
and
his
wife
started
the
proceedings
with
a
formal
reception
at
which
a
chinese
orchestra
furnished
music
outside
the
house
and
western
musicians
rendered
more
familiar
selections
in
the
parlors
alumni
flocked
to
the
reception
men
of
every
variety
of
occupation
but
all
one
in
their
devotion
to
their
alma
mater
the
next
afternoon
was
given
over
to
athletics
and
the
evening
to
a
lecture
quite
in
the
american
fashion
the
third
day
being
sunday
listened
to
an
american
missionary
in
the
morning
who
spoke
boldly
of
the
prime
need
for
a
college
like
this
if
the
youth
of
china
were
to
be
trained
for
the
highest
service
to
their
country
at
night
he
sat
through
nearly
three
hours
of
the
most
amazing
testimony
meeting
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
led
by
a
chinese
who
had
been
graduated
from
the
college
thirty
years
before
the
eagerness
almost
impatience
to
confess
what
jesus
christ
and
christian
education
had
meant
to
these
chinese
leaders
for
it
was
evident
they
leaders
was
a
thing
to
stir
the
most
sluggish
christian
pulse
mind
took
him
back
to
a
memorable
love
feast
at
cartwright
institute
when
joe
carbrook
had
made
his
first
confession
of
and
surrender
to
jesus
christ
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
likeness
between
these
two
so
different
gatherings
was
far
more
real
than
all
their
contrasts
on
monday
the
anniversary
banquet
brought
the
american
consul
a
representative
of
the
provincial
governor
and
many
other
dignitaries
and
on
tuesday
the
students
put
on
a
pageant
which
illustrated
in
gorgeousness
of
color
and
costume
and
accessories
the
history
of
the
college
besides
all
this
pomp
and
circumstance
there
was
a
wonderful
industrial
exhibit
the
president
of
china
sent
a
scroll
as
did
also
the
prime
minister
former
students
in
the
cities
of
china
from
peking
to
amoy
sent
subscriptions
amounting
to
thousand
dollars
for
new
buildings
and
other
old
students
in
the
philippines
sent
a
second
thousand
dollars
all
of
which
stirred
to
the
very
soul
here
was
a
christian
college
older
than
many
in
america
its
results
could
not
be
measured
by
any
visible
standards
yet
he
had
seen
graduates
of
the
school
and
students
who
did
not
stay
long
enough
to
graduate
men
of
light
and
leading
men
of
wealth
and
station
officials
men
in
whom
the
spirit
of
the
new
china
burned
christian
workers
and
all
these
bore
convincing
testimony
that
this
college
had
been
the
one
great
mastering
influence
of
their
lives
a
christian
college
in
china
thought
of
it
all
and
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
i
am
the
same
individual
as
he
who
not
so
many
months
ago
was
talking
about
the
good
sense
of
letting
china
wait
indefinitely
for
christ
anyhow
somebody
has
had
better
sense
than
that
every
day
of
the
last
forty
years
the
tour
of
the
tools
was
teaching
more
than
he
could
teach
the
merchants
of
asia
and
yet
he
was
doing
no
little
missionary
work
as
evidenced
both
in
his
own
reports
to
peter
mcdougall
and
still
more
in
the
reports
which
went
to
that
observant
gentleman
after
had
moved
on
from
any
given
place
the
cummings
hardware
corporation
may
be
without
a
soul
as
corporations
are
known
to
be
but
it
has
many
eyes
these
eyes
followed
progress
from
shanghai
to
foochow
to
hong
kong
to
manila
they
observed
how
he
studied
artisans
and
their
ways
with
tools
and
the
ways
of
builders
with
house
fittings
and
the
various
devices
with
which
in
field
and
garden
the
toilers
set
themselves
to
their
endless
labor
as
the
eyes
of
the
cummings
organization
saw
these
things
the
word
went
back
across
the
water
to
saint
louis
and
peter
mcdougall
took
credit
to
himself
for
a
commendable
shrewdness
but
the
eyes
had
no
instructions
to
report
on
the
tool
missionary
other
activities
and
therefore
no
report
was
made
none
the
less
they
saw
and
wondered
and
thought
that
there
was
something
back
of
it
all
there
was
more
back
of
it
than
they
could
have
guessed
for
had
come
to
a
new
zest
for
both
of
his
quests
the
business
which
had
brought
him
into
the
east
was
daily
becoming
more
fascinating
in
its
possibilities
and
promise
in
even
greater
measure
the
interests
which
belong
especially
to
this
chronicle
were
taking
on
a
new
importance
everywhere
he
went
he
sought
out
the
missions
and
the
missionaries
he
plied
the
workers
with
question
on
question
until
they
told
him
all
the
hopes
and
fears
and
needs
and
longings
which
often
they
hesitated
to
put
into
their
official
letters
to
the
boards
in
manila
he
saw
after
a
little
more
than
two
decades
of
far
from
complete
missionary
occupation
the
signs
that
a
christian
civilization
was
rising
the
schools
and
churches
and
hospitals
and
other
organization
work
established
in
manila
were
proof
that
all
through
the
islands
the
everyday
humdrum
of
missionary
service
was
going
forward
perhaps
without
haste
but
surely
without
rest
when
he
came
to
singapore
that
traffic
corner
to
which
all
the
sea
roads
of
the
east
converge
he
heard
the
story
of
a
miracle
and
then
he
saw
the
miracle
itself
the
college
they
told
him
what
it
meant
not
the
missionaries
only
but
the
chinese
merchants
who
controlled
the
cummings
line
for
all
the
archipelago
and
sumatra
planters
and
british
officials
and
business
men
from
malaysian
trade
centers
whose
names
he
had
never
before
heard
the
teacher
who
put
himself
at
service
was
one
of
the
men
to
whom
pastor
drury
had
written
his
word
of
appeal
on
behalf
he
respected
it
altogether
and
the
more
because
he
well
knew
that
here
was
no
need
for
mere
talk
a
visitor
with
eyes
and
ears
could
come
to
his
own
conclusions
if
the
college
were
not
its
own
strongest
argument
no
words
could
strengthen
it
the
college
had
been
started
by
intrepid
men
who
had
no
capital
but
faith
and
an
overmastering
sense
of
duty
that
was
a
short
generation
ago
now
saw
crowded
halls
and
students
with
purposeful
faces
and
he
heard
how
at
first
by
the
hundreds
and
now
by
thousands
the
product
of
this
school
was
spreading
a
sense
of
christian
through
all
the
vast
island
and
ocean
spaces
from
rangoon
to
new
guinea
and
from
batavia
to
sulu
but
it
may
as
well
be
told
that
even
more
than
china
india
made
the
deepest
impress
on
the
mind
and
heart
of
our
from
the
moment
when
he
landed
in
calcutta
to
the
moment
when
he
watched
the
low
coasts
of
the
ganges
delta
merge
into
the
horizon
far
astern
india
would
not
let
him
alone
he
saw
poverty
such
as
could
scarcely
be
described
and
religious
rites
the
very
telling
of
which
might
sear
the
tongue
if
china
poor
had
a
certain
apathy
which
seemed
like
poise
even
in
their
wretchedness
not
so
india
but
rather
a
misery
a
dull
progress
toward
nothing
better
with
only
nothingness
and
its
empty
peace
at
last
once
in
calcutta
and
his
business
plans
set
going
he
started
out
to
find
some
of
the
city
christian
forces
they
were
not
easy
to
find
as
in
every
oriental
city
missionary
work
is
relatively
small
indeed
began
to
think
that
this
third
city
of
asia
had
little
religion
of
any
sort
he
had
been
prepared
in
part
for
the
first
meager
showing
of
mission
work
on
shipboard
he
had
encountered
the
usual
assortment
of
missionary
critics
the
unobservant
the
profane
the
superior
the
and
all
that
tribe
the
first
of
them
he
had
met
on
the
second
day
out
from
san
francisco
and
every
boat
which
sailed
the
eastern
seas
appeared
to
carry
its
complement
of
and
enemies
of
the
whole
missionary
enterprise
while
steaming
up
the
bay
of
bengal
the
chorus
appeared
at
its
critical
best
was
told
as
they
neared
calcutta
that
the
indian
christian
was
servile
and
slick
and
totally
untrustworthy
never
had
these
expert
observers
seen
a
genuine
convert
but
only
hypocrites
liars
petty
thieves
and
grafters
in
spite
of
it
all
at
last
he
found
the
methodist
mission
and
it
was
not
so
small
when
once
you
saw
the
whole
of
it
by
great
good
fortune
his
instructions
from
home
ordered
him
up
country
as
far
as
cawnpore
and
to
his
delight
he
met
a
methodist
bishop
one
of
the
new
ones
who
was
setting
out
with
a
party
for
the
northwest
so
on
the
bishop
most
cordial
invitation
he
joined
himself
to
the
company
and
learned
in
a
day
or
two
from
experts
how
to
make
the
best
of
india
rather
trying
travel
conditions
benares
allahabad
cawnpore
lucknow
came
to
these
cities
with
a
queer
feeling
of
having
been
there
before
long
ago
in
his
early
sunday
school
days
the
names
of
these
places
and
the
wonders
of
them
had
been
the
theme
of
almost
the
only
missionary
book
he
had
at
that
age
cared
to
read
at
allahabad
said
his
companions
of
the
way
an
epworth
league
convention
was
to
be
held
and
made
up
his
mind
that
a
league
convention
in
india
would
be
doubly
worth
attending
he
did
attend
it
too
but
it
left
no
such
memory
as
another
gathering
in
the
same
city
a
memory
which
he
knows
will
last
after
every
other
picture
of
the
east
has
faded
from
his
recollection
the
party
had
reached
allahabad
at
the
time
of
the
khumb
mela
a
vast
outpouring
of
massed
humanity
too
great
for
any
but
the
merest
guesses
at
its
numbers
this
mela
feast
religious
pilgrimage
whatever
it
might
mean
to
these
endless
multitudes
is
held
here
at
stated
times
because
the
two
sacred
rivers
the
jumna
and
the
ganges
come
together
at
allahabad
and
tradition
has
it
that
a
third
river
flows
beneath
the
surface
to
meet
the
others
so
the
place
is
trebly
sacred
its
waters
potent
for
purification
no
matter
how
great
one
sin
with
the
others
set
out
for
an
advantageous
observation
point
on
the
wall
of
the
fort
which
stands
on
the
tongue
of
land
between
the
two
streams
on
the
way
assured
himself
that
if
calcutta
seemed
without
religion
here
was
more
than
enough
of
it
to
redress
the
balances
in
the
throng
was
a
holy
man
whose
upraised
arm
had
been
held
aloft
until
it
had
atrophied
and
would
never
more
swing
by
his
side
and
yonder
another
holy
one
sat
in
the
sand
with
a
circle
of
little
fires
burning
close
about
him
the
seeker
after
he
knew
not
what
who
made
his
search
while
lying
on
a
bed
of
spikes
was
here
and
once
a
procession
passed
two
hundred
men
all
holy
after
the
fashion
of
hindu
holiness
all
utterly
naked
with
camels
and
elephants
moving
in
their
train
as
if
to
show
how
these
were
counted
men
of
special
sanctity
the
people
fell
on
their
faces
to
the
ground
beside
them
as
they
passed
and
kissed
their
shadows
on
the
sand
the
point
of
vantage
reached
bewildered
eyes
could
scarce
make
his
brain
believe
what
they
saw
he
was
standing
on
a
broad
wall
thirty
feet
above
the
water
and
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
back
from
it
up
and
down
the
stream
was
an
endless
solid
mass
of
heads
looked
for
some
break
in
the
crowd
some
thinning
out
of
its
packed
bodies
but
as
far
as
he
could
see
there
was
no
break
no
end
government
officials
had
estimated
the
number
of
pilgrims
at
two
millions
a
signal
must
have
been
given
or
an
hour
had
come
could
not
tell
which
but
somehow
the
people
knew
that
now
was
the
opportunity
to
enter
the
water
and
gain
cleansing
from
all
sin
a
mighty
resistless
movement
carried
the
human
stream
to
meet
the
river
inevitably
the
weaker
individuals
were
swept
along
helpless
and
those
who
fell
arose
no
more
horrified
stood
looking
down
on
the
slow
irresistible
movement
of
the
writhing
bodies
and
he
saw
a
woman
drop
a
british
police
officer
standing
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
beneath
ordered
a
native
policeman
to
get
the
woman
out
but
the
native
seeing
the
crush
and
unwilling
to
risk
himself
for
so
slight
a
cause
waited
until
his
superior
turned
away
to
another
point
of
peril
and
then
snatching
the
police
turban
from
his
head
was
lost
in
the
general
mass
the
woman
trampled
to
death
and
twenty
other
men
and
women
with
her
in
sight
of
the
stunned
watchers
on
the
wall
who
were
compelled
to
see
these
lives
crushed
out
powerless
to
help
by
so
much
as
a
weight
what
was
it
all
for
asked
his
companions
on
the
wall
and
they
said
that
the
word
went
out
at
certain
times
and
the
people
flocked
to
this
mela
they
came
to
wash
in
the
sacred
waters
at
the
propitious
moment
nothing
else
mattered
not
the
inescapable
pollution
of
the
rivers
not
the
weariness
and
hunger
and
many
distresses
of
the
way
it
was
a
chance
so
the
wise
ones
declared
to
be
rid
of
sin
certainly
it
might
not
avail
but
who
would
not
venture
if
mayhap
there
might
be
cleansing
of
soul
in
the
waters
of
mother
ganges
on
another
day
came
to
a
temple
not
a
great
towering
shrine
but
a
sort
of
place
a
sacred
cow
temple
here
was
a
family
which
had
journeyed
four
hundred
miles
to
worship
before
the
idols
of
this
temple
they
offered
rice
to
one
idol
flowers
to
another
holy
water
from
the
river
to
a
third
no
one
might
know
what
inner
urge
had
driven
them
here
the
priest
slow
to
heed
them
at
length
deigned
to
dip
his
finger
in
a
little
paint
and
with
it
he
smeared
the
caste
mark
on
the
foreheads
of
the
worshipers
it
was
heartless
empty
formality
watched
the
woman
particularly
her
face
was
an
unrelieved
sadness
she
had
fulfilled
the
prescribed
rites
in
the
appointed
place
but
there
was
no
surcease
from
the
endless
round
of
dull
misery
which
she
knew
was
her
ordained
lot
thought
i
suppose
this
is
a
sort
of
joining
the
church
an
initiation
or
something
of
that
sort
not
much
like
what
happened
when
i
joined
the
church
in
delafield
everybody
was
glad
there
here
nobody
is
glad
not
even
the
priest
at
cawnpore
was
able
to
combine
business
with
his
missionary
inquiries
here
he
found
great
woollen
and
cotton
mills
not
unlike
those
of
america
except
that
in
these
mills
women
and
children
were
working
long
hours
seven
days
a
week
for
a
miserable
wage
it
was
heathenism
plus
commercialism
that
is
to
say
a
double
heathenism
for
when
business
is
not
tempered
by
the
christian
spirit
it
is
as
pagan
as
any
cow
temple
in
these
mills
was
a
possible
market
for
certain
sorts
of
cummings
goods
as
learned
in
the
business
quarter
of
the
city
he
wanted
more
opportunity
to
see
how
the
goods
he
dealt
in
could
be
used
and
having
by
now
learned
the
path
of
least
resistance
he
appealed
to
a
missionary
it
was
specially
fortunate
that
he
did
for
the
missionary
introduced
him
to
the
secretary
of
the
largest
mills
in
the
city
an
indian
christian
with
a
history
now
this
is
a
hint
at
the
story
of
well
let
us
call
him
abraham
his
own
is
another
bible
name
of
more
humble
associations
but
he
deserves
to
be
called
abraham
thirty
years
ago
a
missionary
first
evangelized
and
then
baptized
some
two
hundred
villagers
outcasts
untouchables
social
lepers
being
newly
become
christians
they
deposed
their
old
village
god
the
landlord
beat
them
and
berated
them
but
they
were
done
with
the
idol
now
that
was
no
easy
adventure
of
faith
and
those
who
thus
adventured
could
not
hope
for
material
gain
they
were
more
despised
than
ever
yet
inevitably
they
began
to
rise
in
the
human
scale
the
missionary
found
one
of
them
a
young
man
of
parts
him
he
took
and
taught
to
read
to
write
to
know
the
scriptures
he
began
to
be
an
exhorter
then
a
local
preacher
and
at
last
he
joined
the
conference
as
a
methodist
itinerant
at
six
dollars
a
month
now
this
boy
was
the
father
of
abraham
as
a
preacher
he
opened
village
schools
and
taught
the
children
their
letters
his
own
boy
among
them
abraham
learned
quickly
a
place
was
found
for
him
in
a
mission
boarding
school
thence
he
moved
on
and
up
to
lucknow
christian
college
it
was
this
man
who
escorted
through
the
great
mills
of
which
he
was
an
executive
he
had
a
salary
of
two
hundred
dollars
a
month
if
his
father
had
been
an
american
village
preacher
at
twelve
hundred
dollars
a
year
abraham
salary
relatively
would
need
to
be
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
abraham
was
the
superintendent
of
a
sunday
school
in
cawnpore
he
was
giving
himself
to
all
sorts
of
betterment
work
which
would
lessen
the
misery
of
the
poor
he
had
a
seat
in
the
city
council
a
hostel
for
boys
was
one
of
his
enterprises
here
was
a
man
doing
his
utmost
to
christianize
the
industry
in
which
thousands
of
his
country
men
spent
their
lives
a
christian
and
a
man
who
must
be
reckoned
with
no
longer
spurned
and
despised
as
a
casteless
nobody
followed
abraham
about
the
mills
with
growing
admiration
inside
the
walls
light
orderly
paths
flowers
cleanliness
outside
the
gate
to
step
across
the
road
was
to
walk
a
thousand
years
into
the
past
among
the
smells
and
the
ageless
noises
of
the
bazaar
with
its
chaffering
and
cheating
its
primitive
crudities
and
its
changeless
wares
certainly
a
cawnpore
mill
is
not
the
ideal
industrial
commonwealth
but
without
men
like
abraham
to
alleviate
its
grimness
the
coming
of
larger
opportunities
through
work
like
this
might
well
lay
a
heavier
burden
on
men
lives
than
the
primitive
and
costly
toil
which
it
has
displaced
there
was
just
time
for
a
visit
to
lucknow
a
city
which
to
the
british
is
the
historic
place
of
mutiny
and
siege
to
american
methodists
a
place
both
of
history
and
of
advance
worshiped
in
the
great
hindustani
methodist
church
the
busy
home
of
many
activities
in
the
congregation
were
many
students
girls
from
isabella
thoburn
college
and
boys
from
lucknow
christian
college
lifelong
methodist
as
he
was
quickly
recognized
even
amid
these
new
surroundings
the
familiar
aspects
of
a
methodist
church
on
its
busy
day
the
crowding
congregations
were
enough
to
stir
one
blood
a
noble
organ
sounded
out
the
call
to
worship
and
led
the
choir
and
people
in
the
service
of
praise
there
was
a
sunday
school
in
full
operation
and
an
epworth
league
chapter
completely
organized
and
active
his
guide
confided
to
that
this
church
had
yet
another
point
of
resemblance
to
the
great
churches
at
home
it
was
quite
accustomed
to
sending
a
committee
to
conference
to
tell
the
bishop
whom
it
wanted
for
preacher
next
year
was
not
quite
satisfied
the
days
of
his
wanderings
must
soon
be
over
but
before
he
left
india
he
wanted
to
see
the
missionary
in
actual
contact
with
the
immemorial
paganism
of
the
villages
for
he
had
discovered
that
the
village
is
india
how
was
the
christian
message
meeting
all
the
dreary
emptinesses
and
limitations
of
village
life
once
more
he
appealed
to
his
missionary
guide
this
latest
one
the
last
of
the
five
men
to
whom
pastor
drury
had
written
before
had
set
out
on
his
travels
could
he
show
his
visitor
a
little
of
missionary
work
in
village
environment
surely
nothing
easier
the
district
superintendent
said
we
jump
into
my
ford
great
thing
for
india
the
ford
and
still
greater
for
us
missionaries
and
we
go
the
village
of
their
quest
once
reached
the
ford
drew
up
before
a
neat
brick
house
built
around
three
sides
of
a
courtyard
with
verandas
on
the
court
side
this
was
no
usual
mud
hut
but
a
house
and
a
parsonage
withal
here
lived
the
indian
village
preacher
and
his
family
the
preacher
wife
was
neatly
dressed
and
capable
the
children
clean
and
the
room
had
its
table
and
on
the
table
books
that
meant
nothing
to
but
the
superintendent
gave
him
to
understand
that
a
table
with
books
in
an
indian
village
house
was
comparable
in
its
rarity
to
a
american
home
with
a
pipe
organ
and
a
butler
the
lunch
of
native
food
seemed
delicious
if
it
was
hot
to
healthy
appetite
and
if
he
had
not
seen
over
how
tiny
a
fire
it
had
been
prepared
he
would
have
credited
the
smiling
housewife
with
a
lavishly
equipped
kitchen
people
began
to
drop
in
it
was
somewhat
disconcerting
to
the
visitor
to
see
these
callers
squatting
on
their
heels
talking
one
to
another
but
watching
him
continually
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
one
of
them
the
chaudrie
headman
of
the
village
being
introduced
to
told
him
the
superintendent
acting
as
interpreter
how
the
boys
school
flourished
and
how
he
and
other
christians
had
gone
yesterday
on
an
evangelizing
visit
to
another
village
not
yet
christian
but
sure
to
ask
for
a
teacher
soon
the
preacher
in
a
rather
precise
clipped
english
asked
if
he
cared
to
walk
about
the
village
we
could
go
to
the
ward
where
most
of
our
christians
live
they
will
be
most
glad
to
welcome
you
the
way
led
through
dirty
narrow
streets
or
rather
let
us
say
through
the
spaces
between
dwellings
to
the
quarter
here
were
people
of
the
bottom
stratum
of
indian
life
yet
it
was
a
christian
community
in
the
making
the
little
school
was
in
session
a
group
of
fifteen
or
twenty
boys
and
girls
with
their
teacher
it
was
all
very
crude
but
the
children
read
their
lessons
for
the
visitor
and
did
sums
on
the
board
and
sang
a
hymn
which
the
pastor
had
composed
and
recited
the
lord
prayer
and
the
psalm
these
said
the
pastor
are
the
children
of
a
people
which
for
a
thousand
years
has
not
known
how
to
read
or
write
yet
see
how
they
learn
yes
the
superintendent
agreed
but
that
is
the
best
of
it
as
you
know
they
are
untouchables
now
but
even
caste
which
is
stronger
than
death
yields
to
education
once
these
boys
and
girls
have
an
education
they
can
not
be
ignored
or
kept
down
they
will
find
a
place
in
the
social
order
i
can
see
that
said
thinking
of
abraham
but
education
is
not
a
missionary
monopoly
is
it
if
these
children
were
educated
by
hindus
would
not
the
resulting
rise
in
their
condition
come
just
the
same
it
would
perhaps
the
missionary
answered
but
your
is
too
big
for
the
low
caste
and
the
people
there
is
no
education
unless
it
is
christian
education
we
have
a
monopoly
though
not
of
our
choosing
the
educated
hindu
will
not
do
this
work
under
any
circumstances
it
has
been
tried
with
all
the
prestige
of
the
government
which
is
no
small
matter
in
india
and
nothing
comes
of
it
not
long
ago
the
government
proposed
a
wonderful
scheme
for
the
education
of
the
classes
the
money
was
provided
and
the
equipment
as
well
there
were
plenty
of
hindus
that
is
who
were
indebted
to
the
government
for
their
education
they
were
invited
to
take
positions
in
the
new
schools
but
no
not
for
any
money
or
any
other
inducement
would
these
teachers
go
near
and
there
you
are
i
know
of
no
way
out
for
the
great
masses
of
india
except
as
the
gospel
opens
the
door
is
there
no
attempt
of
any
sort
on
the
part
of
indians
who
are
not
christians
surely
some
of
them
are
enlightened
enough
to
see
the
need
and
to
rise
above
caste
suspected
he
was
asking
a
question
which
had
but
one
answer
yes
there
is
such
an
effort
occasionally
the
superintendent
admitted
the
arya
samaj
movement
makes
an
attempt
once
in
a
while
but
it
always
fails
if
a
few
are
bold
enough
to
disregard
caste
they
are
never
enough
to
do
anything
that
counts
the
effort
is
scarcely
more
than
a
gesture
and
even
so
it
would
not
have
been
made
but
for
the
activities
of
the
missionaries
and
so
ended
indian
studies
before
many
days
he
was
retracing
his
way
calcutta
singapore
hongkong
shanghai
yokohama
and
then
on
a
day
he
found
himself
aboard
a
liner
whose
prow
turned
eastward
from
japan
great
port
and
his
heart
was
flying
a
pennant
the
like
of
which
never
trailed
from
any
masthead
this
experiment
teacheth
for
the
first
day
or
so
out
from
japan
behaved
himself
as
does
any
ordinary
american
in
similar
case
all
the
sensations
of
the
journey
were
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
his
longings
to
be
home
the
voyage
so
slow
the
pacific
so
wide
but
shortly
he
resigned
himself
to
the
pervading
restfulness
of
shipboard
and
began
to
make
acquaintances
of
them
all
one
only
has
any
interest
for
us
miss
helen
morel
late
of
manila
her
place
was
next
to
his
at
the
table
like
she
was
traveling
alone
and
before
they
had
been
on
board
hours
they
had
discovered
that
both
were
methodists
he
from
delafield
in
the
middle
west
she
from
pennsylvania
found
altogether
to
his
surprise
that
she
listened
with
flattering
attention
while
he
talked
for
is
no
braggart
nor
is
he
overmuch
given
to
we
know
him
better
than
that
but
it
was
pleasant
none
the
less
on
good
days
to
walk
up
and
down
the
long
decks
and
on
other
days
to
sit
in
comfortable
deck
chairs
with
nothing
to
do
but
talk
miss
morel
being
a
teacher
going
home
after
three
years
of
steady
close
work
in
a
manila
high
school
was
ready
to
talk
of
anything
but
school
work
she
found
herself
immensely
interested
in
experiences
he
had
told
her
of
the
double
life
so
to
say
which
he
had
led
preaching
the
good
news
of
better
tools
and
studying
the
work
of
other
men
and
women
as
truly
salesmen
as
himself
who
preached
a
more
arresting
and
insistent
gospel
i
glad
to
meet
some
one
who
knows
about
missions
at
first
hand
miss
morel
began
one
morning
as
they
stepped
out
on
the
promenade
deck
for
their
constitutional
you
know
i
think
people
at
home
do
understand
at
all
they
are
so
absorbed
with
their
little
parish
affairs
that
they
ca
appreciate
this
wonderful
work
that
is
being
done
so
far
from
home
agreed
though
not
without
mental
reservations
he
knew
how
true
it
was
that
many
of
the
home
folks
did
not
rightly
value
mission
work
but
he
was
not
so
sure
about
their
little
parish
affairs
he
watched
to
see
if
miss
morel
meant
to
expand
that
idea
but
she
evidently
had
thought
at
once
of
something
else
said
she
sometimes
i
think
that
if
the
gossip
about
missionaries
and
missions
which
is
so
general
in
the
orient
gets
back
home
as
it
surely
does
in
one
way
or
another
it
must
have
a
certain
influence
on
what
people
think
about
the
work
oh
that
said
with
no
little
scorn
that
stuff
is
always
ignorant
or
malicious
and
i
doubt
if
it
gets
very
far
with
church
people
of
course
it
may
with
outsiders
i
heard
it
any
amount
of
it
you
ca
miss
it
if
you
travel
in
the
east
and
there
just
enough
excuse
for
it
to
make
it
a
particularly
vicious
sort
of
slander
you
could
say
as
much
about
the
churches
at
home
and
a
case
here
and
there
would
not
be
lacking
to
furnish
proof
certainly
said
the
teacher
and
yet
missions
are
so
wonderful
so
much
more
worth
while
than
anything
that
is
being
done
at
home
you
think
there
it
was
again
i
afraid
i
do
follow
you
miss
morel
said
with
a
puzzled
air
do
you
mean
that
the
churches
at
home
are
not
onto
their
job
if
you
excuse
the
phrase
his
companion
laughed
as
she
answered
maybe
not
quite
as
strong
as
that
but
they
are
doing
the
same
old
thing
in
the
same
old
way
going
to
church
and
home
again
to
sunday
school
and
home
again
to
young
people
meeting
and
home
again
but
out
here
and
her
hand
swung
in
a
half
circle
as
though
she
meant
to
include
the
whole
pacific
basin
out
here
men
and
women
are
doing
such
splendid
pioneer
work
in
all
sorts
of
fascinating
ways
true
enough
assented
i
seen
that
all
right
but
the
home
church
is
so
dead
as
you
might
think
just
before
i
left
delafield
to
go
to
saint
louis
for
instance
a
new
work
for
the
people
of
our
town
was
being
started
with
the
board
of
home
missions
and
church
extension
backing
up
the
local
workers
they
were
planning
to
make
a
great
church
center
for
all
these
people
and
i
hear
that
it
is
getting
a
good
start
oh
yes
i
can
well
believe
that
farwell
miss
morel
hastened
to
say
i
think
work
for
the
immigrant
is
so
very
interesting
do
you
but
of
course
that
not
quite
what
i
meant
the
usual
dull
things
that
churches
do
you
know
well
take
another
instance
that
i
happen
to
remember
had
a
touch
of
the
sort
of
feeling
he
used
to
delight
in
at
cartwright
when
he
was
gathering
his
material
for
a
debate
my
first
summer
after
leaving
college
a
few
of
us
in
first
church
got
busy
studying
our
own
town
we
found
two
of
the
general
church
boards
ready
to
help
us
with
facts
and
methods
the
home
missions
people
gave
us
one
sort
of
help
and
another
board
with
the
longest
name
of
them
all
the
board
of
temperance
prohibition
and
public
morals
showed
us
how
to
go
about
an
investigation
of
the
town
undesirable
citizens
and
their
influence
it
is
in
that
sort
of
business
for
all
of
us
you
know
that
must
have
been
exciting
said
miss
morel
i
know
i
should
enjoy
such
work
what
did
you
find
out
and
what
could
you
do
about
it
that
was
a
question
not
to
be
glibly
answered
knew
but
he
meant
to
be
fair
about
it
we
found
out
plenty
that
surprised
us
a
great
deal
he
added
that
ought
to
be
done
and
much
more
that
needed
to
be
changed
we
even
went
so
far
as
to
draw
up
a
sort
of
civic
creed
everyday
doctrines
of
delafield
the
town
paper
printed
it
and
it
was
talked
about
for
a
while
but
probably
we
were
the
people
who
got
the
most
out
of
it
it
showed
us
what
we
church
members
might
mean
to
the
town
and
that
was
worth
something
miss
morel
was
sure
it
was
but
she
came
back
to
her
first
idea
about
the
home
churches
do
you
think
that
much
of
the
preaching
and
all
that
is
pretty
dull
and
tiresome
i
came
from
a
little
country
church
and
it
was
so
dreary
thought
of
deep
creek
and
said
i
know
what
you
mean
but
even
the
country
church
is
improving
i
must
tell
you
some
time
about
marty
my
chum
he
a
country
preacher
helped
in
his
training
by
the
rural
department
of
the
home
missions
board
and
his
people
come
in
crowds
to
his
preaching
country
churches
are
waking
up
and
the
board
people
at
philadelphia
have
had
a
lot
to
do
with
it
well
i
glad
but
anyway
home
missions
is
rather
commonplace
have
you
noticed
and
miss
morel
looked
almost
as
though
she
were
asking
a
question
of
state
i
ca
say
i
found
it
so
said
stoutly
i
was
some
time
learning
but
i
ran
into
a
lot
of
experiences
before
i
left
home
take
the
work
for
colored
people
for
instance
i
had
to
make
a
speech
at
a
convention
and
i
found
out
that
our
church
has
a
board
of
education
for
negroes
which
is
doing
more
than
any
other
agency
to
train
negro
preachers
and
teachers
and
home
makers
and
doctors
and
other
leaders
that
not
so
very
commonplace
would
you
say
so
well
no
the
young
lady
admitted
it
is
very
important
work
of
course
and
i
dearly
love
to
have
a
share
in
it
i
am
a
great
believer
in
the
colored
races
you
know
but
you
are
making
me
begin
to
think
i
am
all
wrong
about
the
church
at
home
i
do
mean
to
belittle
it
perhaps
i
appreciate
it
more
than
i
realized
anyway
tell
me
something
else
that
you
have
found
out
there
is
time
objected
but
if
you
wo
think
me
a
nuisance
maybe
i
can
tell
you
part
of
it
for
example
sunday
school
long
ago
i
discovered
that
the
whole
church
was
providing
for
sunday
school
progress
through
a
board
of
sunday
schools
and
there
is
a
modern
sunday
school
idea
anywhere
that
this
board
does
put
into
its
scheme
of
work
i
was
a
very
small
part
of
it
myself
for
a
while
so
i
know
yes
and
even
i
know
a
little
about
the
sunday
school
board
confessed
miss
morel
it
has
helped
us
a
lot
in
the
philippines
and
so
i
must
admit
that
the
church
does
try
to
improve
and
extend
sunday
school
work
what
else
told
about
his
experiences
on
the
mexican
border
where
home
missions
and
foreign
missions
came
together
then
seeing
that
she
was
really
listening
he
told
of
his
and
marty
college
days
how
marty
had
borrowed
money
from
the
board
of
education
and
how
the
same
board
had
a
hand
in
the
college
evangelistic
work
he
told
about
the
deaconesses
who
managed
the
hospital
at
manchester
and
the
training
school
which
marcia
dayne
carbrook
had
attended
when
she
was
getting
ready
to
go
to
china
that
school
had
sent
out
hundreds
of
deaconesses
and
other
workers
the
thought
of
marcia
made
him
think
of
joe
and
he
told
what
he
knew
of
how
the
wesley
foundation
at
the
state
university
had
helped
joe
when
he
could
easily
have
made
shipwreck
of
his
missionary
purpose
of
course
the
story
of
his
visit
to
the
carbrooks
in
china
must
also
be
told
miss
morel
changed
the
subject
again
tell
me
farwell
she
asked
were
you
in
the
epworth
league
when
you
were
at
home
i
surely
was
said
that
was
where
i
got
my
first
start
at
the
cartwright
institute
and
the
story
jumped
back
to
those
days
when
he
was
just
out
of
high
school
as
he
paused
miss
morel
said
i
was
an
epworthian
too
and
in
the
young
women
missionary
societies
we
had
a
combination
society
in
our
church
so
i
was
a
esther
and
a
bearer
as
well
those
organizations
did
me
a
world
of
good
you
know
when
i
think
of
it
the
women
missionary
societies
have
done
a
wonderful
work
in
america
and
everywhere
i
guess
they
have
said
i
know
my
mother
has
always
been
a
member
of
both
and
she
always
been
the
most
intelligent
and
active
missionary
in
the
farwell
family
the
talk
languished
for
a
while
and
then
miss
morel
exclaimed
i
know
why
we
stopped
talking
we
hungry
it
is
almost
time
for
luncheon
and
if
you
have
an
appetite
like
mine
you
impatient
for
the
call
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
that
there
was
only
ten
minutes
of
the
morning
left
so
they
separated
to
get
ready
against
the
sounding
of
the
dinner
gong
but
was
not
hungry
he
was
struggling
with
an
old
thought
that
to
him
had
all
the
tantalizing
quality
of
novelty
the
talk
of
the
morning
had
become
a
sort
of
of
church
boards
how
did
it
happen
that
the
church
was
busy
with
this
and
that
and
the
other
work
why
a
board
of
hospitals
and
homes
why
a
deaconess
board
even
though
deaconess
work
happened
to
be
merciful
and
gentle
and
christlike
what
was
the
church
doing
with
a
book
concern
how
came
it
that
we
had
that
board
with
the
long
name
temperance
prohibition
and
public
morals
he
had
traveled
from
yokohama
to
lucknow
and
back
and
everywhere
he
had
found
this
same
church
doing
all
sorts
of
work
with
no
slightest
suspicion
but
that
all
of
it
was
her
proper
business
so
picture
after
picture
flickered
before
his
mind
eye
as
though
his
brain
had
built
up
a
mental
movie
from
all
sorts
of
memory
film
a
hundred
feet
of
this
two
hundred
of
that
a
thousand
here
there
just
a
flash
it
had
all
one
common
mark
it
was
all
the
church
but
the
of
it
its
lightning
change
bewildered
him
the
pictures
leaped
from
cartwright
to
cawnpore
from
the
country
church
at
ellis
to
joe
carbrook
hospital
in
china
from
new
york
and
philadelphia
and
chicago
and
cincinnati
and
washington
to
the
ends
of
the
country
and
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
in
and
through
it
all
swift
bits
of
unrelated
yet
vivid
hints
of
and
of
prayer
meetings
and
institutes
of
new
churches
and
old
colleges
of
revivals
and
sewing
societies
of
league
socials
and
annual
conferences
of
deaconesses
visiting
dreary
homes
and
nurses
going
about
in
great
hospitals
of
beginners
departments
and
old
people
homes
of
kindergartens
and
clinics
and
preparatory
classes
there
seemed
no
end
to
it
all
every
moment
some
new
aspect
of
the
church
activity
showed
itself
and
then
was
gone
it
was
a
most
confused
and
confusing
experience
and
all
through
the
rest
of
the
day
caught
himself
wondering
again
and
again
at
the
variety
and
complexity
of
the
church
affairs
why
should
a
church
be
occupied
with
all
this
medley
why
should
it
be
so
distracted
from
its
main
purpose
to
be
a
jack
of
all
trades
why
should
it
open
its
doors
and
train
its
workers
and
spend
its
money
in
persistent
response
to
every
imaginable
human
appeal
perhaps
that
might
be
it
once
a
philosopher
had
said
i
am
a
man
and
therefore
nothing
human
is
foreign
to
me
what
if
the
church
by
its
very
nature
must
be
like
that
what
if
this
really
were
its
main
purpose
all
these
varied
and
sometimes
almost
conflicting
activities
no
more
than
its
effort
to
obey
the
central
law
of
its
life
was
in
his
stateroom
he
paced
the
narrow
aisle
between
the
berths
three
steps
forward
three
steps
back
like
a
caged
wild
thing
something
was
coming
to
new
reality
in
his
soul
he
was
scarce
conscious
of
the
walls
that
shut
him
in
once
he
stopped
by
the
open
port
he
looked
out
at
the
tumbling
rollers
of
the
wide
pacific
and
as
he
looked
he
thought
of
the
vastness
of
this
sea
how
its
waters
washed
the
icy
shores
of
alaska
and
the
atolls
of
the
marquesas
how
they
carried
on
their
bosom
the
multitudinous
commerce
of
a
hundred
peoples
how
from
santiago
to
shanghai
and
from
the
yukon
to
new
zealand
it
was
one
ocean
serving
all
lands
and
taking
toll
of
all
in
spite
of
all
the
complexities
and
diversities
of
the
lands
about
this
ocean
they
had
one
possession
which
all
might
claim
as
it
claimed
them
the
sea
it
gave
them
neighbors
and
trade
climate
and
their
daily
bread
in
the
sociology
and
geography
and
economics
of
the
orient
this
pacific
ocean
was
the
great
common
denominator
in
the
geography
and
economics
and
sociology
of
the
kingdom
of
god
might
it
not
be
must
it
not
be
the
not
only
the
pacific
basin
but
the
round
world
was
like
that
every
part
of
it
dependent
on
all
the
rest
and
growing
every
day
more
and
more
conscious
of
all
the
rest
railways
helped
this
process
and
so
did
steamships
and
air
routes
and
telegraph
and
wireless
more
than
that
all
the
world
was
becoming
increasingly
related
to
the
life
of
every
part
with
raw
material
produced
in
brazil
to
make
tires
for
the
limousines
of
fifth
avenue
and
the
lake
shore
drive
what
of
the
new
kinship
between
the
producers
in
brazil
and
the
users
in
the
states
all
good
was
coming
to
be
the
good
of
all
the
earth
and
all
evil
was
able
to
affect
the
lives
of
unsuspecting
folk
half
the
earth
circumference
away
in
such
a
time
what
an
insistent
call
for
the
program
and
power
of
the
christian
faith
and
the
call
could
be
answered
had
seen
the
church
applying
the
program
as
well
in
a
chinese
city
and
in
an
indian
village
as
in
his
home
town
and
on
the
mexican
border
he
was
sure
that
the
power
that
was
in
the
christian
message
could
heal
all
the
hurts
of
the
world
and
bring
all
peoples
into
a
of
good
will
this
was
what
jesus
meant
to
do
not
just
to
save
here
and
there
a
little
group
for
heaven
out
of
the
general
hopelessness
but
to
save
and
make
whole
the
heart
of
mankind
the
church
was
not
first
of
all
seeking
its
own
enlargement
but
extending
the
reach
of
its
purpose
it
did
all
its
work
for
a
far
greater
reason
than
any
increase
in
its
own
numbers
and
importance
in
a
word
for
the
christianizing
of
life
sunday
and
every
day
in
delafield
as
well
as
in
the
forests
of
the
amazon
and
the
huddled
cities
of
china
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
berth
in
the
first
glow
of
this
new
understanding
his
nerves
had
steadied
to
a
serenity
that
was
akin
to
awe
yet
he
knew
he
had
made
no
great
discovery
the
thing
he
saw
had
been
there
all
the
time
then
his
mind
set
to
work
again
on
that
motley
procession
of
pictures
which
he
had
likened
to
a
patchwork
film
was
it
as
disjointed
as
it
seemed
could
it
not
be
so
put
together
as
to
make
a
true
continuity
consistent
and
complete
why
not
in
the
events
of
his
own
life
strangely
enough
he
had
the
clue
to
its
right
arrangement
by
what
seemed
to
be
accidental
or
incidental
opportunity
it
had
been
his
singular
fortune
to
come
in
contact
with
some
aspect
or
another
of
all
the
work
his
church
was
doing
and
every
element
of
it
from
the
beginners
class
at
delafield
to
the
language
school
at
nanking
from
the
college
social
in
first
church
to
the
celebration
at
foochow
it
was
all
new
testament
work
its
center
was
always
jesus
christ
teaching
or
example
or
appeal
there
was
in
its
complexity
a
vast
simplicity
each
was
a
part
of
all
and
all
was
in
each
john
wesley
farwell
said
that
young
man
to
himself
this
thing
is
not
your
discovery
but
how
does
that
bit
of
keats
go
felt
i
like
some
watcher
of
the
skies
when
a
new
planet
swims
into
his
ken
or
like
stout
cortez
when
with
eagle
eyes
he
stared
at
the
pacific
and
all
his
men
looked
at
each
other
with
a
wild
surmise
silent
upon
a
peak
in
darien
there
you
have
it
but
i
might
have
known
cortez
if
it
cortez
could
not
have
guessed
the
pacific
he
had
nothing
to
suggest
it
but
i
might
have
guessed
the
singleness
of
the
church
work
what
is
my
name
for
unless
i
can
appreciate
the
man
who
said
world
is
my
parish
and
who
would
do
anything
sell
books
keep
a
savings
bank
open
a
dispensary
for
the
sake
of
saving
souls
that
the
single
idea
the
simple
idea
it
makes
all
these
queer
activities
part
of
one
great
activity
and
rests
them
all
on
one
truth
one
foundation
is
jesus
christ
her
lord
but
the
wonderful
thing
to
me
is
that
after
all
this
time
i
should
suddenly
have
found
this
out
for
myself
what
a
story
to
take
home
to
delafield
pastor
drury
is
going
to
have
the
surprise
of
his
life
three
people
met
as
his
train
pulled
in
to
the
station
at
delafield
the
other
two
were
his
father
and
mother
after
the
first
tearfully
happy
greetings
looked
around
the
platform
i
rather
thought
brother
drury
might
have
come
too
he
said
the
others
exchanged
meaning
glances
and
his
father
asked
then
you
did
get
my
second
letter
at
san
francisco
no
said
in
vague
alarm
only
the
one
what
wrong
is
drury
he
at
home
now
son
said
the
elder
farwell
gravely
he
came
home
from
our
conference
hospital
at
hillcrest
two
weeks
ago
we
hope
going
to
gain
considerable
strength
but
he
had
some
sort
of
a
stroke
we
do
rightly
know
what
and
he
pretty
hard
hit
better
than
he
was
last
week
but
he
ca
leave
his
room
sits
in
his
easy
chair
and
does
say
much
heart
ached
without
always
realizing
it
he
had
been
counting
on
long
talks
with
the
pastor
there
was
so
much
to
tell
him
and
especially
so
since
that
wonderful
day
out
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
when
he
had
seen
what
he
even
dared
to
call
his
of
the
church
so
he
said
you
and
mother
drive
on
home
i
walk
up
with
jeannette
for
lovers
who
had
just
met
after
a
year
separation
these
two
were
strangely
subdued
they
had
everything
to
say
to
each
other
but
this
sudden
falling
of
the
shadow
of
suffering
on
their
meeting
checked
the
words
on
their
lips
will
he
get
better
asked
jeannette
they
fear
not
she
answered
the
doctors
say
he
may
live
for
several
years
but
he
will
never
preach
again
he
just
sits
there
he
been
so
anxious
to
see
you
you
must
go
of
course
and
what
shall
i
say
about
the
wedding
if
he
ca
leave
his
room
jeannette
interrupted
him
if
he
ca
leave
his
room
it
will
make
no
difference
church
wedding
or
home
wedding
i
should
have
chosen
as
i
have
told
you
but
you
and
i
john
wesley
are
going
to
be
married
by
walter
drury
wherever
he
is
if
he
alive
on
our
wedding
day
why
yes
said
with
a
little
break
in
his
voice
it
seem
right
any
other
way
we
can
have
the
dinner
or
breakfast
or
whatever
it
is
just
the
same
but
we
be
married
in
his
room
glad
you
feel
that
way
about
it
too
though
it
just
like
you
and
it
was
so
went
up
to
the
study
as
soon
as
he
could
rid
himself
of
the
dust
of
the
day
travel
more
eager
to
show
walter
drury
he
loved
him
than
to
tell
his
story
or
even
to
arrange
for
the
wedding
as
to
that
ceremony
the
plans
had
long
ago
been
understood
nothing
more
was
needed
than
to
tell
walter
drury
his
study
afforded
a
better
background
and
setting
for
this
particular
wedding
than
a
cathedral
could
provide
was
prepared
for
a
great
change
in
pastor
drury
but
he
noticed
no
such
signs
of
breakdown
as
he
had
expected
to
see
he
did
not
know
that
the
beloved
pastor
was
keyed
up
for
this
meeting
he
could
not
guess
that
the
beaming
eye
the
old
radiant
smile
the
touch
of
color
in
a
face
usually
pale
were
on
special
if
unconscious
display
because
the
pastor
heart
was
thanking
god
that
he
had
been
permitted
to
welcome
home
his
son
in
the
gospel
those
had
been
dreary
days
in
the
hospital
despite
the
ceaseless
ministries
of
nurses
and
doctors
and
friends
from
delafield
this
hospital
was
a
place
of
noble
service
one
of
many
such
places
which
have
arisen
in
the
methodism
of
the
last
forty
years
it
was
a
hospital
through
and
through
the
last
word
in
equipment
and
competence
but
not
at
all
an
institution
it
was
at
once
a
home
for
the
sick
and
a
training
school
of
the
christian
graces
where
the
distressed
of
body
and
mind
could
be
given
the
relief
they
needed
all
of
it
given
gladly
in
christ
name
walter
drury
was
not
unmindful
of
the
care
and
skill
which
the
hospital
staff
lavished
on
him
though
no
more
faithfully
on
him
than
on
many
an
unknown
or
unresponsive
patient
but
he
was
in
a
pitifully
questioning
mood
the
doctors
had
told
him
he
could
not
expect
to
preach
again
when
the
district
superintendent
had
come
to
visit
him
he
carried
away
with
him
walter
drury
request
for
retirement
at
the
coming
session
of
the
annual
conference
in
his
quiet
moments
there
were
so
many
of
them
now
the
broken
man
counted
up
his
years
of
service
all
too
few
as
it
seemed
to
him
and
lacking
much
of
what
they
might
have
shown
in
outcomes
for
the
church
and
the
kingdom
his
conference
was
one
of
the
few
which
paid
the
full
annuity
claim
of
its
retired
preachers
but
even
so
he
had
not
much
to
look
forward
to
his
years
in
the
active
ranks
meant
that
he
could
count
on
times
a
year
on
which
to
live
when
he
gave
up
his
work
perhaps
he
could
live
on
this
with
what
little
he
had
been
able
to
put
aside
at
any
rate
he
could
be
glad
now
that
there
was
none
but
himself
to
think
about
but
was
it
worth
all
he
had
put
into
his
vocation
his
brother
in
saint
louis
not
remarkably
successful
in
his
business
had
been
able
at
least
to
make
some
provision
for
his
old
age
he
too
might
have
been
a
moderately
successful
business
or
professional
man
truly
it
was
more
than
the
older
preachers
had
this
conference
annuity
which
would
keep
him
from
actual
want
so
much
surely
had
been
gained
by
the
church
growing
sense
of
responsibility
for
its
veterans
but
had
it
really
paid
was
all
the
gentle
efficiency
of
the
hospital
and
all
the
church
money
which
would
come
to
him
from
the
conference
funds
and
the
board
of
conference
claimants
enough
to
compensate
him
for
the
long
years
when
he
had
been
spendthrift
of
all
his
powers
for
the
sake
of
his
work
he
knew
of
course
the
answer
to
his
questions
no
one
better
but
he
was
a
preacher
old
before
his
time
and
knowing
the
answer
was
not
at
all
the
same
as
the
answer
so
he
had
been
brought
home
from
hillcrest
and
much
cast
down
nor
did
he
regain
any
of
his
old
buoyancy
of
spirit
until
the
day
when
they
told
him
w
would
be
home
next
week
it
was
then
that
he
told
himself
if
has
come
back
with
only
a
story
to
tell
and
gloom
was
in
his
face
but
if
he
has
come
back
with
story
to
tell
and
his
heart
leaped
within
him
at
the
thought
the
pastor
and
were
soon
talking
away
with
the
old
familiarity
but
mostly
about
inconsequentials
neither
was
quite
prepared
for
more
intimate
communion
and
of
course
the
returning
traveler
had
much
to
do
the
wedding
was
near
at
hand
and
everybody
but
himself
had
been
getting
ready
this
long
time
so
the
call
was
too
brief
to
suit
either
of
them
with
the
longer
visits
each
hoped
for
of
necessity
deferred
to
a
more
convenient
season
must
make
a
hurried
journey
to
saint
louis
to
turn
in
his
report
to
peter
mcdougall
which
report
peter
was
much
better
prepared
to
receive
than
suspected
and
a
highly
satisfactory
arrangement
was
made
for
continued
connection
with
the
cummings
hardware
corporation
doubtless
all
weddings
are
much
alike
in
their
ceremonial
aspects
short
or
long
ancient
ritual
or
commonplace
legal
form
the
essence
of
them
all
is
that
this
man
and
this
woman
say
i
will
so
it
was
in
walter
drury
study
and
then
the
little
group
seated
itself
about
the
pastor
marty
with
alma
wetherell
soon
to
become
marty
all
the
shenks
the
elder
farwells
john
wesley
and
jeannette
the
dinner
would
not
be
for
an
hour
yet
and
this
was
the
pastor
time
pastor
drury
could
not
talk
much
he
had
kept
his
chair
as
he
read
the
ritual
and
now
he
sat
and
smiled
quietly
on
them
all
but
once
and
again
his
eye
sought
and
the
look
was
a
question
yet
unanswered
what
sort
of
a
voyage
home
did
you
have
farwell
asked
her
son
motherlike
using
even
a
query
about
the
weather
to
turn
attention
to
her
boy
a
good
voyage
mother
said
a
fine
voyage
but
one
day
will
you
let
me
tell
it
here
all
of
you
i
hardly
been
any
more
eager
for
my
wedding
day
than
for
a
chance
to
say
this
i
wo
tire
you
drury
will
i
you
never
do
that
my
boy
said
the
preacher
but
do
bother
about
me
i
long
had
a
feeling
that
what
you
are
going
to
say
will
be
better
for
me
than
all
the
doctors
for
he
had
seen
the
eager
glow
on
face
and
his
heart
was
ready
to
be
glad
thus
it
was
that
told
the
story
of
his
great
moment
how
he
had
talked
with
miss
morel
one
morning
of
the
work
of
the
church
and
how
in
the
afternoon
he
had
looked
through
the
open
port
of
his
stateroom
and
had
seen
an
ocean
that
looked
like
the
church
and
a
church
that
seemed
like
the
ocean
i
shall
remember
that
day
forever
i
think
he
said
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
could
put
all
the
pieces
of
my
life
together
my
home
my
church
the
sunday
school
the
league
college
the
needy
life
of
this
town
your
country
work
marty
mexico
china
india
everything
and
i
could
see
as
one
wonderful
perfect
picture
every
bit
of
it
necessary
to
all
the
rest
our
church
at
work
to
make
jesus
christ
lord
of
all
life
in
my
home
and
clear
to
the
of
the
world
out
yonder
under
the
snows
of
tibet
can
you
see
it
folks
i
think
always
could
mr
drury
and
he
put
his
hand
affectionately
on
the
knee
pastor
drury
face
was
even
paler
than
its
wont
but
in
his
eyes
glowed
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
he
was
hearing
what
sometimes
he
had
feared
he
might
not
last
long
enough
to
hear
the
experiment
was
justified
and
he
was
comforted
he
picked
up
the
bible
that
lay
near
his
hand
and
turned
to
the
gospel
by
luke
i
hope
none
of
you
will
think
wrest
the
book
words
to
lesser
meanings
he
said
but
there
is
only
one
place
in
it
that
can
speak
what
is
in
my
heart
and
he
read
the
song
of
simeon
in
the
temple
lord
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
thy
salvation
and
so
to
the
end
it
was
very
still
when
his
weak
voice
ceased
but
in
a
moment
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
cry
from
why
drury
it
has
been
all
these
years
what
do
you
mean
said
marty
somewhat
alarmed
and
thoroughly
mystified
exactly
what
i
say
marty
ca
you
see
it
too
ca
all
of
you
see
it
and
looked
from
one
face
to
another
around
the
room
jeannette
know
what
i
mean
do
you
and
jeannette
at
once
smiling
and
tearful
said
yes
thought
about
it
many
times
and
i
know
now
it
is
true
marty
said
maybe
so
but
what
for
he
was
still
bewildered
why
began
with
eager
haste
drury
planned
all
this
years
and
years
ago
not
our
wedding
i
do
mean
that
and
he
paused
long
enough
to
find
jeannette
hand
and
get
it
firmly
in
his
own
we
managed
that
ourselves
did
we
dear
but
i
do
know
why
this
blessed
minister
of
god
began
somewhere
far
back
yonder
to
show
me
what
god
was
trying
to
do
through
our
church
and
later
through
the
other
churches
he
saw
that
i
went
to
institute
he
steered
me
through
my
sunday
school
work
he
showed
me
my
lifework
he
made
me
want
to
go
to
college
he
introduced
me
to
the
delafield
that
is
outside
our
own
church
he
got
me
my
job
in
saint
louis
do
you
dare
to
deny
it
as
the
pastor
raised
a
protesting
hand
i
talked
with
our
sales
manager
he
put
the
idea
of
the
far
eastern
trip
into
mind
and
well
it
has
been
pastor
drury
all
these
years
he
knew
what
he
was
pastor
drury
had
kept
his
secret
bravely
but
there
was
no
need
to
keep
it
longer
and
now
he
was
well
content
that
these
dear
friends
should
have
discovered
it
on
such
a
day
of
joy
after
all
it
had
been
a
beautiful
experiment
and
not
altogether
without
its
value
so
he
made
no
more
ado
and
in
his
heart
there
was
a
great
peace
