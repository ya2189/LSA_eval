lyttleton
it
was
as
we
have
seen
through
the
remarkable
and
unexpected
return
of
colonel
mires
to
england
and
the
no
less
singular
circumstance
of
the
rencontre
in
the
bench
that
old
wilton
was
reinstated
in
the
position
from
which
years
back
he
had
been
by
the
harsh
rigour
of
the
law
ruthlessly
expelled
as
nathan
gomer
had
stated
to
grahame
the
colonel
not
only
came
forward
to
prove
the
genuineness
of
his
own
signature
and
the
integrity
of
the
document
to
which
it
was
attached
but
he
was
able
to
show
that
a
duplicate
existed
to
point
out
the
solicitor
in
whose
hands
it
had
been
placed
and
to
help
to
refresh
this
old
recollection
as
to
what
had
become
of
that
most
important
paper
the
individual
thus
from
his
seclusion
had
long
retired
from
practice
but
he
yet
retained
many
important
deeds
and
documents
to
which
he
had
been
attesting
witness
or
a
party
in
some
way
it
was
therefore
mainly
by
colonel
instrumentality
that
wilton
was
once
more
a
man
of
wealth
and
position
and
knowing
this
the
former
felt
no
scruple
in
becoming
a
frequent
visitor
at
house
he
had
indeed
a
secret
motive
which
impelled
him
to
present
himself
pretty
constantly
at
table
he
had
not
unmoved
looked
upon
the
face
of
flora
wilton
first
in
the
courtyard
of
the
prison
and
many
times
since
when
surrounded
by
all
those
accessories
to
personal
charms
which
elegant
dress
and
freedom
from
anxiety
afford
at
first
a
high
degree
of
admiration
was
raised
in
his
breast
by
a
personal
beauty
of
rare
excellence
which
at
the
same
time
struck
him
as
being
familiar
to
him
a
glorious
star
worshipped
in
boyhood
since
lost
and
now
suddenly
reappearing
in
his
sphere
which
was
only
too
sparsely
studded
with
orbs
of
light
the
admiration
deepened
as
it
was
fed
by
frequent
observation
into
a
more
ardent
emotion
love
and
passion
were
called
into
being
and
the
colonel
had
not
been
long
the
frequent
guest
at
abode
ere
he
found
himself
ardently
in
love
with
flora
he
was
at
an
age
when
love
is
a
dangerous
tenant
in
a
breast
in
youth
he
had
been
tinged
with
romance
but
he
had
had
more
than
enough
selfishness
to
counteract
its
promptings
his
passions
were
no
doubt
strong
while
they
lasted
but
they
were
sufficiently
evanescent
to
commit
no
havoc
on
his
heart
there
was
one
solitary
case
in
which
the
love
which
is
deaf
to
the
urgings
of
and
susceptible
to
all
that
is
noble
generous
and
exalted
sought
a
home
in
his
bosom
but
the
heart
he
coveted
had
been
bestowed
the
hand
be
yearned
to
obtain
was
given
to
another
he
was
compelled
to
subdue
the
fonder
workings
of
his
soul
and
in
a
distant
clime
amid
the
whirl
of
gay
heartless
frivolous
society
to
deaden
the
restless
action
of
a
sentiment
he
could
not
wholly
forget
he
was
so
far
successful
that
he
reduced
it
to
subordination
the
stirring
activity
of
camp
life
and
warfare
the
indolent
intriguing
nature
of
domestic
society
in
india
where
ladies
are
scarce
and
gentlemen
officers
are
in
excess
these
and
many
other
causes
peculiar
to
his
isolation
from
all
his
english
ties
kept
this
emotion
deep
beneath
the
surface
it
was
however
like
a
trout
in
a
deep
and
shady
recess
in
a
pool
and
would
spring
to
the
surface
whenever
the
attracting
influence
of
a
tempting
object
reached
it
he
had
as
we
have
said
been
but
a
short
time
a
partaker
of
the
pleasant
society
of
flora
when
he
found
raging
in
his
breast
a
flame
which
burned
the
fiercer
at
every
attempt
he
himself
made
to
subdue
it
when
it
became
evident
to
him
that
her
beauty
was
the
predominating
object
in
his
vision
whether
absent
from
her
or
present
he
determined
to
settle
the
question
by
widening
the
intervals
of
his
visits
he
shortened
them
under
the
impression
that
they
were
lengthened
his
conduct
towards
her
soon
began
to
wear
the
colour
and
the
impress
of
his
feelings
his
dark
brown
eyes
settled
upon
her
with
a
dreamy
fond
expression
his
dark
visage
scarcely
susceptible
of
change
yet
showed
the
glow
of
pleasure
he
felt
when
she
appeared
in
the
room
and
his
voice
softened
to
a
mellow
tone
as
he
addressed
her
in
language
which
often
partook
of
the
rich
imagery
of
the
east
at
first
he
had
the
field
all
to
himself
his
society
his
ardent
gaze
and
his
honeyed
words
did
not
appear
distasteful
to
her
she
did
not
refrain
from
appearing
when
she
knew
that
he
was
in
the
nor
did
she
show
any
disposition
to
retire
when
in
his
society
this
was
gratifying
to
him
as
soon
as
he
discovered
that
she
had
become
necessary
to
his
happiness
and
yet
it
afforded
ground
for
a
very
small
congratulation
flora
had
not
noticed
his
conduct
as
distinct
from
the
manner
in
which
she
was
usually
accosted
and
regarded
from
her
earliest
recollection
every
one
had
looked
upon
her
smilingly
and
tenderly
and
spoken
to
her
gently
and
fondly
colonel
mires
had
done
no
more
and
she
saw
nothing
different
in
his
behaviour
to
her
to
that
of
others
at
all
times
she
had
been
grateful
for
this
good
feeling
so
generally
evinced
towards
her
and
had
tried
to
repay
it
by
being
herself
sweet
tempered
kind
mannered
and
soft
spoken
hitherto
she
had
made
no
distinction
between
persons
now
she
began
to
perceive
that
there
was
one
she
should
like
to
make
a
homage
it
would
be
little
short
of
felicity
to
herself
to
render
she
began
to
feel
that
there
was
a
voice
whose
music
touched
her
brain
and
thrilled
the
pulses
of
her
heart
whose
language
simple
as
it
might
be
bore
a
richer
poetry
than
all
that
tongue
of
poet
ever
uttered
there
was
a
hand
whose
pressure
filled
her
with
emotions
no
other
touch
could
raise
there
was
a
presence
whose
absence
was
not
compensated
for
by
the
coming
of
all
the
world
beside
she
began
to
be
sensible
of
the
new
feeling
growing
upon
her
and
taking
possession
of
her
soul
after
hal
vivian
paid
his
first
visit
as
distinct
from
and
subsequent
to
that
when
accompanied
by
lotte
he
being
rather
retiring
by
nature
and
abashed
by
the
style
in
which
the
wiltons
now
lived
made
his
appearance
but
seldom
though
he
would
gladly
have
spent
every
hour
of
the
day
beneath
the
roof
that
sheltered
flora
but
if
he
came
seldom
colonel
mires
came
often
and
thus
flora
began
to
shape
her
first
distinction
between
persons
she
had
no
objection
to
the
frequent
appearance
of
mires
but
she
would
infinitely
rather
that
hal
came
oftener
even
if
his
coming
were
to
cause
the
absence
of
the
colonel
even
if
it
occasioned
him
to
stay
away
for
ever
she
did
not
permit
this
impression
in
favour
to
show
itself
as
soon
as
she
began
to
recognise
it
and
assure
herself
that
it
was
a
reality
she
fashioned
it
into
her
first
secret
which
was
to
be
looked
at
with
no
eyes
but
her
own
so
she
came
to
compare
the
interval
that
passed
between
the
visits
of
hal
and
the
space
of
time
that
elapsed
during
the
absence
of
colonel
mires
and
she
began
to
think
that
if
hal
had
ever
conceived
the
notion
of
vexing
her
this
was
just
the
plan
that
would
be
most
successful
at
each
of
his
last
visits
hal
had
met
colonel
mires
the
ordinary
civilities
passed
between
them
but
they
looked
at
each
other
with
fierce
eyes
colonel
mires
could
not
but
regard
young
vivian
as
a
formidable
rival
who
must
be
got
rid
of
at
any
cost
he
had
not
forgotten
how
when
first
he
gazed
upon
the
fair
face
of
flora
she
hung
upon
his
arm
and
seemed
to
cling
to
him
as
if
with
him
only
was
safety
he
could
not
but
see
now
how
pleased
and
even
tender
was
the
expression
of
her
eyes
when
they
were
turned
upon
him
and
how
sweet
the
smile
with
which
she
welcomed
him
he
could
not
avoid
noticing
that
hal
was
a
young
fellow
dressed
in
the
latest
style
of
fashion
in
clothes
of
the
best
material
chosen
with
excellent
taste
and
that
the
small
quantity
of
jewellery
he
displayed
was
of
costly
material
and
the
very
first
workmanship
altogether
the
colonel
felt
himself
matched
against
heavy
odds
and
he
foresaw
that
he
would
have
to
adopt
in
the
coming
struggle
unusual
weapons
it
was
true
he
had
the
chances
that
the
young
tradesman
might
not
aspire
to
hand
or
if
he
had
the
temerity
to
do
so
it
was
scarcely
probable
that
old
wilton
would
give
his
assent
to
such
an
alliance
he
had
however
but
little
faith
in
chance
and
he
resolved
not
to
trust
to
it
to
set
wilton
and
young
vivian
at
variance
and
to
ruin
him
in
estimation
were
tasks
to
which
he
designed
to
devote
himself
and
to
which
he
would
have
exclusively
applied
himself
but
that
hal
turned
out
to
be
not
the
only
competitor
he
had
to
deal
with
notion
of
colonel
mires
is
quickly
summed
up
it
was
that
the
conveyed
insult
in
every
glance
he
directed
at
flora
and
that
he
waited
but
for
the
opportunity
in
private
to
act
as
he
would
not
dare
openly
day
thought
hal
with
set
teeth
and
a
frowning
brow
shall
have
to
beat
him
to
a
he
looked
forward
to
that
day
not
without
a
feeling
of
eager
anticipation
when
old
wilton
made
one
of
the
party
he
engrossed
the
conversation
of
the
colonel
there
was
much
to
refer
to
in
the
events
of
the
past
and
the
old
man
was
minute
in
his
inquiries
and
pertinacious
in
insisting
upon
copious
and
clearly
expressed
details
while
thus
occupied
the
colonel
with
fiery
eyes
would
watch
the
movements
of
hal
and
flora
with
sickening
forebodings
he
would
note
how
completely
satisfied
they
were
with
each
society
how
unflagging
their
conversation
how
little
the
outer
world
attracted
their
attention
how
completely
they
were
absorbed
in
gazing
into
each
eyes
and
treasuring
up
words
or
observations
light
and
simple
in
themselves
which
fell
from
the
lips
loves
her
he
grated
through
his
compressed
teeth
the
whelp
shall
no
more
wed
her
than
if
she
were
a
princess
royal
of
it
is
possible
that
wilton
obtained
some
incoherent
answers
during
the
periods
when
the
colonel
was
mentally
making
these
observations
and
it
is
certain
that
the
manner
of
the
latter
to
hal
grew
more
distant
haughty
and
contemptuous
than
ever
even
as
to
him
grew
more
defiant
keeping
pace
with
it
it
was
upon
a
day
when
flora
and
vivian
while
wilton
was
pursuing
some
inquiries
addressed
to
colonel
mires
standing
in
the
recess
of
a
deep
bay
window
conversing
in
a
low
tone
about
lotte
that
the
colonel
found
his
position
insupportable
old
wilton
was
more
than
usually
pointed
in
his
questions
and
displayed
great
anxiety
about
the
exactness
of
the
replies
he
requested
the
colonel
was
frequently
called
upon
to
repeat
his
answers
and
in
many
instances
to
explain
them
with
deliberation
and
clearness
all
the
time
he
was
called
upon
to
do
this
he
observed
hal
and
flora
in
close
animated
converse
conducted
in
so
low
a
tone
that
not
a
word
could
reach
his
ears
it
was
so
intended
flora
did
this
for
sake
the
circumstances
which
had
happened
in
connection
with
her
were
not
of
a
nature
to
be
spoken
loudly
in
indifferent
ears
she
therefore
depressed
her
voice
to
so
soft
a
tone
that
hal
had
to
bend
his
face
near
to
hers
to
catch
the
sound
and
comprehend
its
meaning
her
warm
breath
must
frequently
have
played
upon
his
cheek
if
so
it
was
as
balmy
as
the
softest
zephyr
ever
breathed
upon
a
summer
evening
as
fragrant
as
the
odour
of
a
thousand
flowers
mires
rapidly
lost
the
sound
of
voice
and
heard
nothing
but
the
low
murmuring
tones
of
the
youthful
pair
saw
nought
but
that
hand
rested
upon
arm
and
that
their
faces
were
in
a
proximity
which
maddened
him
to
behold
bear
it
longer
he
could
not
he
was
just
about
to
betray
himself
by
some
violent
insane
remark
when
a
servant
entered
and
announced
to
wilton
that
malcome
grahame
accompanied
by
the
honorable
lester
vane
would
be
glad
of
a
few
conversation
with
him
the
gentlemen
in
here
wilton
returned
laconically
at
least
this
interruption
was
in
the
eyes
of
colonel
mires
agreeable
for
it
broke
up
that
torturing
tète
and
saved
him
from
committing
himself
in
a
very
ridiculous
manner
he
could
not
however
let
pass
the
opportunity
of
scowling
at
young
vivian
in
a
way
highly
expressive
of
hatred
and
malignity
which
was
responded
to
by
the
young
gentleman
who
saw
and
rightly
interpreted
it
with
a
steadfast
look
of
ineffable
scorn
the
servant
returned
and
almost
immediately
ushered
in
malcolm
and
lester
vane
young
grahame
sent
his
eyes
swiftly
round
the
room
in
search
of
lotte
but
was
grievously
disappointed
not
to
see
her
vane
looked
directly
in
face
and
continued
to
do
so
during
the
interview
with
but
a
trifling
exception
causing
her
embarrassment
which
he
observed
with
pleasure
because
whenever
he
perceived
that
he
raised
an
emotion
in
the
female
breast
he
supposed
that
he
had
eliminated
a
symptom
favourable
to
himself
malcolm
finding
the
only
person
he
had
really
come
to
visit
not
present
opened
his
business
to
wilton
who
received
him
with
sufficient
coldness
to
have
made
uncomfortable
a
more
sensitive
person
dear
wilton
he
said
with
much
awkward
hesitation
was
the
intention
of
my
good
mamma
and
two
of
my
sisters
to
have
paid
you
and
miss
wilton
an
introductory
visit
to
open
up
a
friendship
between
you
and
to
induce
if
possible
miss
wilton
to
form
an
agreeable
intimacy
with
my
sisters
but
unfortunately
my
elder
sister
helen
was
most
unaccountably
and
suddenly
attacked
with
a
fainting
fit
yesterday
morning
and
she
is
still
very
mamma
has
therefore
been
unable
to
carry
out
her
wish
but
fearing
that
you
might
after
your
interview
with
my
father
imagine
there
was
some
inexplicable
delay
in
the
tender
of
kind
and
social
relations
to
you
and
your
remarkably
charming
daughter
miss
wilton
i
have
been
greatly
to
my
own
satisfaction
deputed
to
act
as
their
and
to
offer
the
kindest
congratulations
of
our
at
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
wilton
coldly
inclined
his
head
thank
grahame
and
her
daughters
for
the
honour
they
intend
me
and
miss
wilton
he
said
frigidly
do
not
at
present
mix
much
in
society
we
leave
to
a
future
time
the
desire
to
form
new
friends
permit
me
however
to
thank
you
for
the
manner
in
which
you
have
performed
the
task
allotted
to
no
credit
due
to
me
for
that
replied
malcolm
truly
believe
he
added
folks
at
home
are
animated
by
a
wish
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
you
and
your
family
and
upon
my
honour
i
echo
it
besides
we
are
relatives
you
know
relatives
grahame
observed
old
wilton
as
though
he
wished
that
they
should
continue
such
he
turned
abruptly
to
lester
vane
and
continuing
said
vane
are
you
of
the
vanes
of
durham
branch
of
my
family
replied
vane
uncle
of
mine
lived
on
an
estate
in
the
county
robert
tempest
vane
of
weardale
old
and
dear
friend
of
mine
we
were
hoys
and
men
together
friends
from
our
first
meeting
until
death
separated
us
cried
wilton
with
ardour
to
hear
this
wilton
exclaimed
vane
eagerly
i
be
permitted
to
hope
that
you
will
allow
me
although
i
can
do
so
but
imperfectly
i
fear
to
renew
that
friendship
in
my
unworthy
person
wilton
took
his
proffered
hand
and
grasped
it
warmly
shall
have
the
sincerest
pleasure
in
such
an
arrangement
he
responded
will
afford
me
much
gratification
i
loved
your
uncle
for
his
frank
heart
his
noble
spirit
and
his
honourable
manliness
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
you
i
shall
find
a
worthy
representative
of
hope
i
shall
not
wrong
so
generous
a
supposition
said
vane
with
affected
modesty
feel
assured
you
will
not
rejoined
wilton
and
turning
to
flora
he
said
me
specially
present
the
honorable
lester
vane
to
you
my
darling
as
the
nephew
of
the
dearest
friend
i
ever
had
i
request
you
out
of
your
love
for
me
to
render
to
him
the
warmest
hospitality
of
our
house
and
such
direct
attention
as
my
most
valued
guest
is
at
all
times
entitled
flora
bowed
at
her
fervidly
uttered
instructions
and
submitted
her
hand
to
the
pressure
of
lester
but
she
liked
not
his
eyes
they
made
her
as
they
had
done
helen
grahame
shudder
she
liked
not
his
voice
least
of
all
she
liked
the
cold
touch
of
his
soft
smooth
fingers
wilton
he
said
in
a
subdued
deep
tone
i
could
have
formed
a
wish
constructed
so
as
to
gain
for
me
in
its
realisation
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
felicity
it
should
have
been
that
which
would
have
compassed
what
has
come
to
pass
to
be
thrown
into
the
society
of
your
honoured
parent
the
loved
friend
of
a
relative
whose
memory
i
reverence
is
indeed
a
deep
gratification
but
to
have
to
that
happiness
added
the
high
privilege
commended
to
your
best
attention
of
enjoying
your
sweet
society
is
to
place
me
in
a
state
of
beatitude
of
which
i
am
undeserving
but
of
which
in
true
sincerity
of
heart
i
will
strive
to
make
myself
lester
vane
was
rather
fond
of
this
flowery
style
of
expression
it
was
a
mistake
when
adopted
to
create
an
effect
on
such
minds
as
those
possessed
by
flora
wilton
or
helen
grahame
it
was
as
hollow
to
them
and
as
transparent
as
a
glass
globe
malcolm
thought
it
a
masterly
power
of
language
to
make
woman
colonel
mires
had
some
such
thought
and
gnawed
his
lips
as
he
listened
hal
only
smiled
and
turned
away
if
such
expressions
were
flowers
at
all
he
believed
them
to
be
artificial
flowers
and
at
best
a
bad
imitation
of
nature
to
this
rhapsody
as
to
her
request
flora
only
bowed
she
turned
her
face
away
from
steadfast
gaze
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
her
when
the
interview
terminated
and
she
should
be
once
more
alone
with
hal
for
she
imagined
she
had
still
much
to
say
to
him
malcolm
grahame
had
received
special
commands
from
his
father
to
make
himself
as
agreeable
to
flora
as
circumstances
would
permit
and
he
actually
made
some
way
in
her
good
opinion
because
he
spoke
a
little
earnestly
of
lotte
expressed
a
fear
that
he
had
startled
her
at
the
sudden
meeting
in
the
garden
and
uttered
a
wish
to
see
her
to
offer
an
apology
for
unintentional
rudeness
if
such
were
needed
he
dropped
no
hint
that
he
knew
her
to
be
humble
in
her
position
spoke
praisefully
of
her
pleasant
face
her
smiling
eyes
and
her
graceful
figure
and
he
did
so
with
such
seeming
frankness
of
tone
and
manner
that
flora
felt
absolutely
gratified
she
smiled
on
him
as
she
had
not
done
on
lester
vane
she
talked
to
him
with
less
reserve
than
she
would
have
displayed
if
that
particular
subject
had
not
been
broached
and
vane
grew
absolutely
envious
to
find
that
malcolm
who
had
not
had
the
benefit
of
a
friendly
word
from
wilton
made
evidently
more
rapid
progress
in
his
good
graces
than
he
who
stood
before
her
with
the
advantages
of
person
rank
and
a
powerful
recommendation
from
her
father
he
looked
on
claim
to
her
favour
as
simply
contemptible
he
had
a
mean
opinion
of
his
intellect
and
of
his
capabilities
as
a
rival
he
would
have
laughed
him
to
scorn
he
could
hardly
understand
therefore
the
progress
had
made
in
good
opinion
it
was
something
of
a
lesson
he
however
dismissed
the
impression
it
had
for
a
moment
made
upon
his
mind
he
accounted
for
it
in
accordance
with
his
own
low
estimate
of
feminine
truth
and
purity
by
the
conceit
that
flora
was
playing
off
malcolm
against
him
with
the
view
of
securing
by
that
small
piece
of
coquetry
his
direct
attention
malcolm
failed
notwithstanding
his
diligent
inquiries
to
learn
more
about
lotte
than
that
she
was
no
longer
in
the
house
and
that
she
lived
in
london
in
the
western
quarter
there
the
conversation
respecting
her
ceased
he
had
sense
enough
to
understand
that
to
pursue
it
further
would
be
to
make
his
notice
of
her
too
marked
having
renewed
a
pressing
invitation
to
wilton
and
his
daughter
if
they
would
graciously
waive
the
introductory
visit
of
his
mamma
on
account
of
his
sister
sudden
attack
and
having
as
he
believed
and
with
some
show
of
reason
rendered
himself
quite
as
agreeable
to
miss
wilton
as
could
under
the
circumstances
be
expected
he
took
his
leave
accompanied
by
lester
vane
the
latter
individual
wholly
indifferent
as
to
the
effect
he
might
produce
upon
the
minds
of
the
gentlemen
there
assembled
was
very
desirous
of
creating
an
impression
upon
flora
but
he
failed
to
attract
even
a
glance
from
her
and
her
hand
motionless
under
his
pressure
was
hastily
withdrawn
even
as
he
touched
it
when
he
retired
through
the
doorway
he
saw
that
her
gaze
was
fastened
upon
the
face
of
the
young
and
handsome
person
introduced
to
him
as
vivian
his
quick
eye
and
his
experience
noted
all
these
symptoms
of
the
small
way
he
had
made
in
her
favour
said
he
to
himself
will
fall
far
more
easily
into
my
mesh
than
helen
grahame
she
is
so
pure
so
guileless
so
innocent
of
the
ways
that
she
is
without
suspicion
that
best
defence
for
woman
against
art
my
heart
now
aches
to
gain
her
she
must
be
mine
my
wife
be
it
but
she
shall
be
mine
he
had
at
his
departure
informed
wilton
that
he
should
take
advantage
of
his
friendly
invitation
and
he
hoped
that
his
occasional
visits
would
not
be
deemed
intrusive
the
warmth
with
which
old
wilton
responded
to
this
suggestion
by
repeating
his
desire
that
he
would
frequently
test
his
hospitality
removed
any
hesitation
he
might
have
in
again
presenting
himself
there
without
a
special
invitation
and
he
determined
quickly
to
avail
himself
of
an
opening
so
eminently
favourable
to
his
design
to
lay
siege
to
heart
somehow
the
interruption
caused
by
these
visitors
seemed
to
render
the
remaining
part
of
the
day
less
cheerful
and
happy
than
it
had
commenced
old
wilton
sat
in
his
easy
chair
plunged
in
deep
thought
colonel
mires
though
full
of
rumination
took
care
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
hal
and
by
joining
them
flora
occasionally
appeared
abstracted
and
hal
wore
an
expression
upon
his
face
very
much
as
if
his
visions
of
the
future
were
clouded
and
sad
as
the
colonel
did
not
and
would
not
shift
his
quarters
the
conversation
grew
until
at
length
it
became
absolutely
irksome
to
hal
and
he
rose
to
depart
flora
fancied
that
as
he
bade
her
farewell
his
tone
was
cold
and
she
missed
the
pressure
of
his
hand
she
knew
too
his
eye
was
averted
and
he
lingered
not
as
usual
upon
the
threshold
of
the
door
but
he
went
away
and
never
looked
back
to
meet
the
gaze
she
directed
to
him
and
which
meant
to
say
with
an
expression
she
could
not
trust
to
her
words
nor
to
her
soft
fingers
but
he
looked
not
back
once
no
not
once
yet
when
without
the
house
he
directed
his
steps
to
the
nearest
entry
to
the
park
and
paused
not
until
he
gained
a
spot
where
he
could
look
upon
the
lighted
window
of
the
room
in
which
he
knew
she
sat
thinking
perhaps
of
the
gentleman
who
had
that
day
been
first
presented
to
her
and
was
shortly
to
be
little
else
than
a
constant
companion
flora
dearest
he
murmured
compressing
his
hands
tightly
was
a
dream
a
happy
happy
dream
i
wake
to
misery
you
can
never
never
be
mine
it
would
be
only
mad
presumption
to
entertain
longer
a
hope
so
blissful
oh
so
very
blissful
you
will
wed
some
one
higher
nobler
than
myself
for
you
are
of
proud
and
high
descent
and
i
but
humbly
born
if
in
this
your
happiness
be
secured
i
love
you
far
far
too
well
to
seek
or
wish
a
change
i
can
only
hope
and
pray
that
he
who
wins
you
may
love
you
as
truly
as
fondly
as
devotedly
as
i
he
paused
for
his
throat
swelled
and
there
was
a
gush
of
water
in
his
eyes
that
made
the
lighted
window
upon
which
they
rested
dim
and
indistinct
now
shall
be
my
future
course
he
continued
with
deep
emotion
ambition
is
strangled
in
its
birth
fame
what
have
i
to
do
with
fame
sought
only
that
my
hour
of
triumph
should
be
rewarded
by
her
sweet
smile
of
joy
what
to
me
the
rank
in
which
high
success
would
place
me
if
her
eyes
glowing
with
gratified
pride
at
sight
of
the
honours
i
had
won
were
lost
to
me
no
life
hath
no
more
a
motive
to
render
it
worth
its
endurance
a
rifle
and
the
prairies
of
the
far
west
shall
be
my
world
there
at
least
in
the
vast
solitudes
i
can
uninterrupted
dwell
upon
her
memory
revel
in
glorious
visions
of
her
angel
a
hand
placed
lightly
upon
his
shoulder
interrupted
his
soliloquy
he
turned
sharply
to
find
at
his
side
colonel
mires
word
with
you
he
said
to
hal
abruptly
returned
hal
coldly
can
have
to
say
to
me
can
as
well
be
said
here
as
elsewhere
we
are
sight
of
that
window
it
is
perhaps
as
well
returned
the
colonel
there
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
hal
made
no
remark
upon
the
insinuation
thus
conveyed
and
the
colonel
proceeded
you
i
ought
to
have
no
difficulty
in
coming
to
the
point
he
said
with
one
in
a
different
position
my
task
would
not
be
so
easy
therefore
i
at
once
say
i
perceive
that
you
with
ignorant
cried
hal
fiercely
me
another
word
if
such
expressions
are
to
be
addressed
to
me
i
will
submit
to
insult
from
no
man
breathing
he
who
attempts
it
had
need
beware
of
a
strong
arm
and
a
spirit
which
never
yet
bent
or
quailed
before
a
is
not
my
design
to
insult
you
i
gain
no
end
by
it
if
i
use
plain
terms
attribute
it
to
my
desire
to
describe
exactly
the
act
of
one
of
mean
birth
aspiring
to
ally
himself
to
a
house
with
a
pedigree
extending
to
the
norman
mires
as
few
words
if
you
please
between
us
as
possible
briefly
state
the
object
of
your
seeking
this
interview
with
me
my
answer
shall
be
clear
decided
and
prompt
as
it
so
an
accident
has
enabled
you
to
render
a
service
to
miss
wilton
the
firemen
of
london
nightly
do
the
same
thing
to
hundreds
and
are
content
with
the
fee
they
receive
as
their
reward
you
on
the
contrary
with
as
i
have
said
warn
you
to
be
choice
in
your
terms
actually
on
account
of
the
common
deed
you
performed
have
inflated
yourself
with
a
monstrous
notion
that
you
might
aspire
to
the
hand
of
a
young
lady
of
birth
and
wealth
you
have
perhaps
been
led
to
nurse
this
ridiculous
conception
because
miss
wilton
with
the
true
and
refined
courtesy
of
a
lady
has
extended
towards
you
a
kindness
of
manner
she
would
have
displayed
to
the
very
fireman
you
forestalled
if
he
had
been
the
person
who
rescued
her
from
the
peril
she
was
you
finished
cried
hal
impatiently
i
have
told
you
to
abandon
for
ever
the
wild
and
preposterous
idea
which
seems
to
have
taken
possession
of
you
and
to
abstain
from
further
visits
to
the
house
of
wilton
under
the
risk
of
my
resentment
and
perhaps
an
ignominious
punishment
i
have
reply
is
sir
returned
hal
with
a
swelling
breast
and
a
sensation
upon
his
forehead
like
a
burning
band
i
wholly
deny
your
right
to
interfere
either
in
or
my
affairs
i
have
further
to
inform
you
that
i
am
master
of
my
actions
and
that
i
intend
to
remain
so
i
conclude
sir
by
telling
you
in
full
explanation
of
the
estimation
in
which
i
hold
your
resentment
that
should
you
dare
in
my
hearing
speak
of
miss
wilton
as
but
now
you
have
done
or
should
attempt
to
renew
this
conversation
with
me
i
will
treat
you
as
i
would
a
snarling
troublesome
officious
hound
stand
out
of
my
path
hal
placed
his
open
hand
on
the
breast
of
colonel
mires
and
thrust
him
back
he
strode
with
a
firm
but
dignified
step
from
the
spot
yelled
mires
will
horsewhip
you
for
this
shall
meet
when
you
have
a
horsewhip
answered
hal
scornfully
your
promises
until
with
rage
and
fury
swelling
his
frame
and
forming
a
hundred
schemes
of
a
deadly
revenge
the
foiled
colonel
hastened
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
hal
had
taken
this
villain
hopes
to
take
to
his
arms
the
fairest
brightest
piece
of
handicraft
hal
muttered
as
he
pursued
his
way
homeward
will
vex
and
trouble
her
by
his
detestable
addresses
oh
flora
dearest
if
i
may
not
aspire
to
your
hand
or
hope
for
your
love
i
may
at
least
pass
my
life
in
protecting
you
from
the
machinations
of
such
villains
as
this
at
least
i
shall
be
near
you
i
will
watch
over
you
and
preserve
you
from
ill
if
i
may
never
never
shelter
you
from
harm
within
these
arms
as
my
own
my
chapter
the
dreadful
secret
oh
shame
oh
guilt
oh
horror
oh
remorse
oh
punishment
had
satan
never
fallen
hell
had
been
made
for
me
oh
leonora
leonora
leonora
young
helen
grahame
borne
helpless
to
her
remained
for
many
hours
without
exhibiting
any
sign
of
returning
consciousness
an
experienced
physician
had
been
summoned
and
at
length
the
fit
was
so
far
mastered
by
the
application
of
remedies
and
restoratives
that
the
semblance
of
death
no
longer
remained
and
she
was
roused
into
motion
though
not
to
consciousness
she
was
delirious
at
first
and
sitting
upright
in
the
bed
caught
the
terrified
weeping
evangeline
by
the
wrist
and
pointed
into
vacancy
see
she
shrieked
stands
tottering
on
the
side
hold
him
back
for
mercy
sake
hold
him
back
or
he
will
be
lost
oh
hugh
but
one
moment
pause
for
very
charity
pause
i
come
to
you
one
moment
hugh
i
will
hang
on
your
breast
i
will
cling
to
you
i
will
go
through
the
world
with
you

one
instant
save
him
save
him
hugh
hugh
see
he
curses
me
his
eyes
glare
angrily
on
me
he
tosses
his
hands
wildly
in
the
air
he
leaps
ha
a
piercing
shriek
burst
from
her
lips
and
rang
through
the
house
evangeline
threw
her
arms
round
her
sister
and
by
force
prevented
her
from
springing
from
the
bed
on
to
the
floor
darling
she
exclaimed
sobbing
as
she
felt
the
quivering
trembling
frame
of
her
sister
shake
in
every
limb
as
though
she
was
struck
with
an
ague
look
upon
me
i
am
eva
sister

see
only
a
horrible
vision

dreadful
dream

words
mock
me
exclaimed
helen
in
a
low
subdued
tone
her
large
dark
eyes
wandering
slowly
round
the
room
word
helen
dearest
and
i
would
not
utter
it
my
cold
selfishness
has
killed
him
the
remorseless
sea
has
closed
over
him
the
moaning
wind
chants
his
dirge
the
slimy
seaweed
entangles
his
locks
he
lays
upon
the
cold
cold
sand
in
the
green
depths
his
white
wan
face
turned
despairing
to
the
harsh
world
which
had
no
compassion
for
him
he
is
gone
he
is
for
ever
gone
i
i
have
slain
him
a
fearful
passion
of
hysteric
weeping
followed
these
words
her
whole
frame
was
convulsed
it
took
the
united
aid
of
the
physician
chayter
and
evangeline
to
hold
her
down
in
order
to
prevent
her
committing
some
wild
act
of
delirious
extravagance
the
paroxysm
passed
away
but
it
left
her
utterly
prostrate
the
physician
declaring
her
out
of
immediate
danger
retired
leaving
evangeline
and
chayter
to
watch
by
her
as
she
lay
wan
and
motionless
the
faint
heaving
of
her
bosom
only
telling
that
she
was
not
dead
intercourse
with
hugh
was
known
only
to
herself
and
to
him
she
had
no
and
it
was
well
that
grahame
was
not
present
during
the
ravings
uttered
by
her
daughter
a
secret
is
never
so
well
kept
as
when
it
is
never
entrusted
helen
believed
this
and
confided
to
no
one
the
love
passage
in
her
young
life
evangeline
in
her
innocence
believed
that
the
mere
relation
of
the
incident
with
which
hugh
riversdale
was
connected
coming
upon
helen
at
a
moment
when
she
was
not
quite
in
health
had
so
shocked
her
as
to
produce
this
grave
result
but
such
would
not
have
been
the
interpretation
by
grahame
at
present
that
lady
decided
in
her
own
mind
that
helen
had
been
attacked
by
this
fit
wholly
irrespective
of
the
paragraph
in
the
paper
but
she
would
at
once
have
surmised
the
truth
if
she
had
seen
how
her
daughter
wept
the
loss
of
the
person
they
not
notice
the
report
of
the
physician
was
that
she
had
suffered
a
severe
attack
of
hysteria
that
she
was
much
prostrated
with
a
tendency
to
be
delirious
but
that
though
she
might
be
compelled
to
keep
her
chamber
for
some
time
there
was
no
real
danger
was
necessary
that
she
should
be
well
nursed
he
said
and
as
he
perceived
that
in
that
mansion
where
pride
reigned
supreme
she
was
not
likely
to
obtain
the
careful
and
constant
attention
which
she
so
much
needed
he
recommended
a
person
to
be
sent
for
from
the
institution
for
trained
nurses
grahame
approved
of
the
suggestion
and
within
a
couple
of
hours
one
a
tall
matronly
female
was
duly
installed
empress
of
sick
chamber
she
had
a
struggle
at
first
to
wrest
the
empire
from
evangeline
but
she
was
so
forcible
in
her
reasoning
and
so
kind
and
gentle
in
her
manner
that
eva
yielded
up
the
sway
on
the
understanding
that
she
should
spend
the
greater
portion
of
her
time
at
her
bedside
and
now
the
house
assumed
an
aspect
of
quiet
the
duke
of
allborne
had
just
begun
to
find
favourable
qualities
in
margaret
not
visible
to
the
eyes
of
others
but
bright
in
his
for
her
homage
to
him
had
been
so
direct
that
he
could
but
notice
and
approve
it
direct
flattery
rarely
disgusts
the
it
charmed
the
duke
and
he
purred
as
he
received
it
he
would
have
become
more
marked
in
his
attentions
to
the
artful
girl
but
sudden
illness
brought
his
and
lester
visit
to
an
abrupt
close
they
quitted
with
expressions
of
complimentary
condolence
and
promised
at
a
future
time
to
repeat
their
visit
both
intended
to
keep
their
word
lester
vane
had
no
thought
of
yielding
up
his
designs
on
helen
he
neither
forgot
nor
forgave
he
had
correctly
read
her
intention
to
make
a
prize
of
his
heart
and
then
to
toss
it
away
as
a
worthless
gain
he
overlooked
the
provocation
he
gave
her
for
entertaining
such
a
scheme
unjustifiable
as
it
was
and
he
resolved
to
punish
her
there
was
a
blow
to
wipe
out
and
he
thought
he
knew
how
to
exact
ample
vengeance
in
atonement
of
it
so
he
determined
to
return
again
to
the
house
when
helen
had
recovered
the
anticipated
visit
of
old
wilton
and
his
daughter
flora
to
the
house
of
grahame
was
not
paid
the
reason
assigned
was
that
wilton
with
his
daughter
had
gone
into
the
country
rather
unexpectedly
to
take
possession
of
the
estate
of
which
he
had
been
so
long
deprived
the
pressing
claims
upon
grahame
were
all
satisfied
a
large
sum
had
been
placed
to
his
credit
at
his
bankers
and
proceedings
were
going
on
to
carry
into
effect
nathan
scheme
grahame
was
upon
the
whole
though
rather
mystified
and
vexed
by
a
lurking
uneasiness
glad
that
the
deed
bearing
the
signature
of
eustace
wilton
which
the
latter
had
never
written
had
so
strangely
disappeared
and
he
was
also
rather
pleased
though
perplexed
to
find
chewkle
had
never
returned
to
him
after
his
departure
with
the
professed
object
of
enlisting
the
services
of
two
arrant
scoundrels
in
the
atrocious
business
of
false
swearing
he
therefore
set
out
on
a
business
visit
to
an
estate
he
possessed
in
scotland
with
a
much
easier
frame
of
mind
and
a
more
decided
disposition
to
enact
the
part
of
a
haughty
feudal
lord
than
he
had
done
on
the
visits
immediately
preceding
the
present
grahame
and
margaret
were
incessantly
engaged
in
fulfilling
with
propriety
what
they
deemed
the
duties
of
the
station
they
held
they
were
in
their
carriage
the
day
and
the
night
at
the
opera
at
and
routs
evangeline
spent
all
the
time
allotted
her
by
her
mamma
and
by
the
nurse
truebody
in
room
but
in
the
sick
chamber
or
away
from
it
her
soft
footsteps
and
her
sweet
low
voice
were
rarely
heard
so
the
mansion
was
for
the
most
part
silent
as
an
untenanted
house
of
prayer
helen
was
slowly
recovering
she
was
still
very
ill
since
her
raving
in
her
delirium
she
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
the
fond
and
affectionate
questions
of
evangeline
she
replied
by
a
faint
loving
smile
or
a
gentle
pressure
of
the
hand
but
not
a
word
to
the
physician
or
to
the
nurse
she
either
nodded
slightly
or
shook
her
head
but
not
a
sound
escaped
her
lips
at
length
the
physician
terminated
his
visits
recommending
that
helen
should
rise
for
an
hour
or
two
extending
the
time
each
day
until
she
had
strength
enough
to
resume
her
ordinary
routine
of
life
truebody
had
been
most
attentive
to
her
patient
her
medical
knowledge
was
excellent
and
frequently
most
usefully
applied
her
kindness
her
patient
unweary
watching
most
exemplary
it
had
won
as
it
could
not
fail
to
do
the
gratitude
of
helen
occasionally
displayed
by
a
beaming
look
not
at
all
difficult
of
interpretation
one
night
towards
midnight
when
eva
had
after
embracing
and
kissing
her
sister
tenderly
retired
to
her
own
room
to
pray
as
usual
for
the
speedy
restoration
of
helen
to
health
truebody
seated
herself
by
the
bedside
and
took
wasted
hand
in
her
own
and
held
it
there
grahame
she
said
in
a
low
tone
are
progressing
though
slowly
to
recovery
but
there
is
one
impediment
to
your
more
rapid
return
to
health
which
i
confess
i
am
sadly
afraid
can
not
be
easily
she
paused
helen
turned
her
dark
eyes
upon
her
with
an
inquiring
look
but
did
not
speak
have
a
weight
preying
on
your
mind
which
alone
causes
the
physical
prostration
under
which
you
suffer
continued
truebody
will
continue
to
keep
you
here
unless
prompt
arrangements
are
made
to
alleviate
it
by
some
decided
step
on
your
helen
remained
silent
still
truebody
went
on
you
a
friend
miss
grahame
she
asked
adding
do
not
mean
a
mere
acquaintance
nor
yet
a
relative
but
a
friend
in
whom
you
can
place
the
fullest
confidence
and
who
would
spare
no
exertion
and
faint
not
at
trial
and
trouble
to
serve
you
speak
my
child
for
in
truth
it
is
a
momentous
question
i
ask
of
helen
faintly
shook
her
head
and
in
a
feeble
voice
replied
i
have
not
not
one
the
tears
clustered
in
her
eyes
truebody
gazed
upon
her
sadly
have
need
of
one
sore
need
of
one
she
said
gravely
you
have
some
painful
secret
in
your
there
was
a
silence
as
of
the
grave
eyes
looked
into
the
dark
shadow
in
her
room
as
though
there
she
saw
a
phantom
she
spoke
not
you
never
confided
by
word
or
hint
to
anyone
that
grief
which
now
oppresses
you
asked
truebody
in
a
curiously
solemn
tone
a
flush
spread
itself
over
the
hitherto
pale
features
of
helen
and
then
it
passed
away
leaving
her
whiter
than
ever
she
murmured
in
a
low
voice
where
is
he
who
has
brought
you
to
this
condition
asked
truebody
in
a
tone
betraying
indignation
do
not
speak
do
not
think
harshly
of
him
exclaimed
helen
with
a
quivering
lip
anguish
his
misery
and
his
despair
were
greater
than
my
own
then
in
hoarse
accents
she
briefly
spoke
of
the
circumstances
which
called
hugh
away
of
his
letter
to
her
of
her
mental
struggles
her
hesitation
and
vacillation
until
too
late
even
to
write
to
him
and
then
of
the
incident
published
in
the
newspaper
truebody
listened
in
silence
with
her
eyes
intently
fixed
upon
features
perusing
them
earnestly
as
though
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
not
something
more
which
helen
studiously
concealed
but
she
did
not
seem
to
find
what
she
sought
presently
she
said
abruptly
you
married
a
change
instantly
passed
over
the
features
of
helen
an
expression
impossible
to
describe
it
told
that
a
throng
of
unutterable
thoughts
were
passing
through
her
brain
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
she
said
in
an
almost
inarticulate
voice
truebody
took
a
firmer
hold
of
her
hand
in
my
eyes
my
child
she
said
solemnly
me
truly
are
you
ignorant
of
your
actual
condition
my
condition
feebly
echoed
helen
you
not
my
poor
girl
exclaimed
truebody
in
a
deep
and
earnest
tone
ere
a
few
short
months
have
passed
over
your
head
you
will
become
a
mother
face
became
instantly
of
a
ghastly
whiteness
she
turned
an
affrighted
glare
upon
truebody
her
lips
moved
as
though
she
would
speak
but
could
not
a
film
spread
itself
over
her
eyes
a
moment
before
unnaturally
bright
and
she
swooned
away
truebody
let
fall
her
hand
and
hastened
to
apply
restoratives
her
tears
fell
fast
upon
the
pallid
countenance
over
which
she
bent
like
a
tender
mother
she
murmured
deluded
child
riches
have
not
saved
her
from
sin
nor
spared
her
sorrow
oh
woman
woman
you
who
claim
this
frail
creature
as
your
child
what
have
you
not
to
answer
for
once
again
helen
became
conscious
and
now
she
was
face
to
face
with
her
true
position
now
she
felt
more
terribly
the
upbraidings
of
for
not
having
complied
with
passionate
appeal
to
her
but
the
opportunity
was
passed
he
was
gone
perhaps
to
heaven
she
was
here
alone
alone
with
her
sin
something
to
surprise
she
did
not
exhibit
the
violent
emotions
she
had
expected
her
to
give
way
to
on
being
restored
to
a
full
sense
of
her
position
she
wept
it
is
true
her
eyes
rained
tears
and
her
sobs
low
wailing
sobs
were
very
painful
to
hear
but
she
was
almost
motionless
it
was
as
though
she
cowered
beneath
the
to
hide
herself
for
very
shame
after
a
time
she
whispered
is
a
dreadful
secret
a
most
dreadful
secret
i
have
had
since
i
have
laid
here
a
terrifying
sense
of
the
truth
but
i
drove
it
away
i
would
not
think
of
it
i
would
not
believe
it
but
oh
is
it
true
is
it
true
true
repeated
truebody
emphatically
helen
clasped
her
hands
and
said
to
her
imploringly
me
to
deal
with
this
fearful
discovery
alone
but
oh
truebody
if
you
have
a
spark
of
human
charity
breathe
not
to
mortal
the
calamity
with
which
heaven
has
afflicted
me
in
meting
out
to
me
my
deserts
oh
think
of
my
and
of
my
pride
in
the
honour
of
our
house
to
know
of
my
fall
would
crush
them
that
foul
blot
on
their
escutcheon
would
slay
them
oh
truebody
let
me
not
add
murder
to
my
dread
fault
i
implore
you
i
pray
of
you
upon
my
knees
with
bitter
bitter
tears
i
will
pray
of
you
as
you
alone
discovered
my
secret
so
retain
it
in
your
own
comforted
in
this
my
poor
child
she
replied
will
not
add
a
pang
to
the
anguish
which
i
am
sure
you
must
now
so
keenly
suffer
but
what
i
must
know
and
what
i
will
know
is
the
course
you
are
going
to
shall
know
as
soon
as
i
have
the
power
to
decide
at
present
my
brain
is
racked
with
agony
my
temples
burn
and
throb
i
can
not
collect
my
thoughts
into
anything
like
coherency
let
me
but
have
quiet
quiet
truebody
and
i
shall
be
able
then
to
shape
out
the
path
my
guilt
and
shame
may
compel
me
to
take
without
injuring
or
degrading
those
who
are
so
jealous
of
their
virtue
and
their
thought
truebody
they
had
mixed
up
with
this
stern
purity
of
character
a
little
common
humanity
if
the
haughty
mother
of
this
frail
sinful
girl
had
been
but
as
proud
of
being
a
good
watchful
loving
parent
as
she
has
been
of
her
long
line
of
ancestry
this
dreadful
thing
surely
had
not
she
turned
to
helen
and
said
shall
have
quiet
and
rest
so
that
you
may
gather
strength
to
reflect
upon
the
consequences
of
your
terrible
error
and
pray
to
god
for
will
try
to
do
all
you
counsel
responded
helen
excitedly
though
speaking
in
the
same
hissing
undertone
i
must
be
left
for
a
time
to
myself
be
alone
quite
alone
above
all
let
not
eva
come
to
me
grahame
no
no
not
eva
not
eva
i
can
not
now
dare
to
look
in
her
sinless
face
i
can
not
bear
the
soft
gaze
of
her
innocent
eyes
nor
hear
those
affectionate
words
emanating
from
her
pure
heart
without
acutely
feeling
each
look
each
tone
of
her
dear
voice
as
a
terrible
reproach
i
have
so
looked
down
upon
her
simplicity
taunted
her
guilelessness
scoffed
at
her
singleness
of
heart
that
the
very
sight
of
her
seems
to
humble
me
to
the
will
be
so
very
grieved
to
be
forbidden
the
usual
seat
by
your
bedside
said
truebody
deprecatingly
know
it
i
feel
it
i
can
see
her
turning
sorrowfully
away
when
you
deny
her
access
to
me
but
she
is
now
to
me
an
angel
of
such
spotless
purity
and
i
so
foul
so
black
so
begrimed
with
wickedness
that
were
she
to
lay
her
tender
hand
upon
me
and
with
those
immaculate
lips
press
my
hot
forehead
i
should
shrink
from
her
fearing
to
pollute
her
by
the
you
may
inwardly
feel
and
i
would
not
have
you
repulse
any
such
sense
of
your
grievous
fault
it
will
be
necessary
to
obtain
a
control
over
your
feelings
and
to
appear
much
as
usual
said
truebody
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
by
refusing
to
see
your
sister
eva
dear
sweet
creature
that
she
is
you
will
give
rise
to
questions
which
it
will
be
difficult
to
will
be
guided
by
you
but
pray
let
me
be
alone
for
the
next
day
or
two
urged
helen
will
tell
her
that
unless
i
am
for
a
short
time
left
entirely
to
myself
my
recovery
will
be
greatly
retarded
she
will
not
after
that
press
her
own
kind
desires
in
opposition
to
my
recovery
and
now
if
my
beating
brain
will
let
me
i
will
try
to
sleep
and
strive
to
gather
strength
for
oh
i
have
a
dreadful
task
to
encounter
a
desperate
part
to
play
good
night
truebody
remember
your
promise
not
a
word
to
mortal
not
a
word
not
a
word
as
you
hope
hereafter
for
mercy
from
the
almighty
truebody
slept
in
a
small
antechamber
her
room
door
was
in
apartment
and
this
she
always
left
open
all
night
having
performed
a
few
necessary
duties
and
bade
helen
farewell
for
the
night
she
retired
to
her
bed
at
length
helen
was
quite
alone
the
slight
hum
of
the
trees
in
the
garden
was
broken
only
by
the
monotonous
ticking
of
the
over
the
fireplace
an
hour
passed
and
not
a
sound
broke
the
intense
stillness
which
reigned
throughout
the
house
suddenly
helen
sat
straight
up
in
the
bed
she
stretched
her
arms
out
and
murmured
in
accents
of
the
keenest
misery
hugh
hugh
pardon
and
pity
me
if
you
are
dead
come
to
me
in
the
spirit
let
your
sad
eyes
once
more
turn
on
mine
i
will
not
tremble
nor
faint
nor
be
appalled
come
to
me
bear
me
with
you
for
oh
it
is
dreadful
to
be
here
alone
alone
hugh
oh
you
know
not
how
lone
i
am
so
utterly
lonely
no
no
oh
mercy
heaven
not
not
alone
no
more
alone
with
a
low
wail
more
like
a
cry
of
horror
than
the
sob
of
anguish
she
sank
shivering
down
and
buried
her
head
beneath
the
once
more
she
raised
herself
and
parted
her
long
black
hair
from
her
tearful
eyes
dim
with
long
weeping
you
dead
hugh
she
moaned
is
happiness
for
you
if
you
are
i
may
not
die
i
dare
not
die
i
must
live
live
for
for
oh
i
shall
go
frantic
live
live
where
where
she
clasped
her
hands
in
despair
i
can
not
stay
here
no
i
must
out
into
the
world
oh
where
to
hide
my
misery
and
my
shame
from
all
the
pitying
and
the
pitiless
oh
hugh
that
i
had
fled
to
you
if
i
had
but
listened
to
the
pleadings
of
my
heart
i
had
not
fallen
before
the
whisperings
of
my
pride
and
thus
the
night
through
did
she
start
up
and
murmur
in
moaning
accents
or
hide
herself
beneath
the
sobbing
and
wailing
in
the
very
wildest
grief
the
pale
gray
dawn
began
to
show
through
the
transparent
blind
when
sleep
stole
over
the
exhausted
girl
and
it
was
ere
she
awoke
strengthened
though
not
refreshed
by
her
long
slumber
awoke
as
truebody
had
told
her
to
be
face
to
face
with
her
miserable
situation
she
did
not
shrink
from
it
the
nurse
kept
her
promise
and
suffered
no
one
to
enter
the
chamber
but
herself
and
helen
had
all
the
quiet
she
could
hope
for
she
lay
motionless
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
nurse
could
however
see
that
her
mind
was
working
with
ceaseless
activity
occasionally
she
would
perceive
her
dark
eyes
shining
with
an
unnatural
brilliancy
turned
upon
herself
and
she
knew
that
helen
was
taking
into
her
calculations
her
aid
or
her
silence
she
did
not
try
to
induce
her
to
speak
especially
as
she
saw
that
she
had
a
disinclination
to
do
so
she
believed
it
to
be
better
for
her
to
think
a
steady
reflection
upon
the
failings
of
our
nature
tends
to
promote
an
endeavour
to
remedy
them
under
such
an
impression
she
did
not
care
to
make
helen
talk
helen
slept
all
that
night
but
the
following
day
was
a
counterpart
of
the
last
neither
grahame
nor
margaret
made
any
attempt
to
see
her
when
they
were
requested
not
to
visit
her
for
a
day
or
so
but
evangeline
could
scarcely
be
moved
from
the
chamber
door
she
stole
there
upon
tiptoe
and
stood
without
for
hours
listening
intently
if
she
could
have
only
heard
helen
speak
it
would
have
made
her
heart
light
and
glad
that
night
at
the
hour
when
the
household
were
retiring
to
repose
evangeline
escaped
the
vigilance
of
truebody
and
crept
to
the
bedside
helen
lay
there
in
deep
thought
as
for
hours
she
had
been
living
over
her
past
life
and
vainly
trying
to
shape
out
of
the
obscure
future
the
lot
she
would
have
to
endure
her
restless
eyes
suddenly
fell
upon
the
upturned
loving
face
of
her
sister
that
face
so
full
of
tenderness
and
yet
charged
with
an
expression
deprecating
her
anger
for
having
broken
through
the
arrangement
which
compelled
her
absence
at
first
helen
shrank
as
if
horrified
from
her
but
evangeline
leaned
over
and
caught
her
in
her
arms
not
be
angry
with
me
helen
dearest
she
said
entreatingly
indeed
indeed
i
could
not
sleep
without
speaking
just
one
little
word
to
you
and
kissing
you
i
sobbed
all
last
night
it
was
foolish
i
know
but
i
could
not
bear
to
go
to
bed
without
having
even
seen
you
during
the
do
not
touch
me
eva
said
helen
gasping
and
struggling
to
free
herself
from
her
affectionate
embrace
eva
burst
into
tears
not
be
cross
with
me
helen
darling
for
i
love
you
fondly
and
dearly
she
exclaimed
i
too
much
intrude
my
love
upon
you
forgive
me
for
i
can
not
help
it
say
to
me
only
night
eva
and
kiss
me
and
i
will
leave
you
oh
so
happy
helen
could
not
bear
this
tenderness
of
her
and
not
respond
to
it
she
strained
her
passionately
to
her
bosom
and
sobbed
violently
upon
her
neck
she
then
wiped
her
scalding
tears
from
her
burning
eyes
and
kissed
eva
fervidly
upon
the
forehead
she
whispered
in
her
ear
love
you
with
my
whole
soul
i
have
wronged
you
i
have
treated
you
with
unkindness
darling
no
unfeeling
scorn
eva
cruel
selfish
pride
i
am
punished
eva
you
can
not
dream
how
fearfully
but
let
that
pass
mine
the
crime
mine
the
atonement
know
this
however
that
my
eyes
are
opened
and
my
error
stands
before
me
a
monument
of
glowing
brass
you
do
not
understand
this
sweet
eva
but
you
will
comprehend
that
from
the
inmost
depths
of
my
heart
i
love
and
honour
in
in
the
the
time
to
come
i
shall
never
forget
your
more
than
sisterly
affection
your
dear
love
for
me
and
i
shall
pray
for
blessings
to
be
showered
upon
you
eva
pray
for
you
as
i
hope
you
will
will
pray
for
the
last
words
were
almost
inaudible
she
kissed
the
astonished
eva
again
and
again
with
passionate
fervour
and
then
she
bade
her
not
to
say
a
word
but
to
leave
her
and
come
again
at
the
same
hour
on
the
following
night
you
will
say
night
and
good
bye
dearest
to
me
will
you
not
helen
asked
eva
softly
and
fondly
helen
felt
as
if
she
should
be
suffocated
by
a
rising
hysterical
sob
but
she
contrived
to
force
out
the
words
night
and
good
bye
dearest
eva
and
then
she
fell
back
almost
lifeless
on
the
bed
eva
bent
over
her
imprinted
one
last
kiss
upon
her
burning
lips
and
then
ran
out
of
the
room
with
a
heart
throbbing
with
joy
and
kneeling
down
at
her
own
bedside
she
prayed
with
sincerity
and
fervour
for
the
recovery
and
for
the
happiness
of
her
sister
helen
in
the
early
morning
while
helen
seemed
yet
sleeping
truebody
went
upon
an
errand
which
her
patient
had
begged
her
to
execute
herself
it
took
her
to
no
great
distance
from
the
house
and
when
she
returned
she
went
into
the
kitchen
and
made
breakfast
for
helen
herself
according
to
her
usual
custom
and
then
she
carried
it
up
to
her
bedside
but
helen
was
not
there
nor
in
the
room
nor
in
the
house
ransacked
in
wild
terror
by
truebody
upon
the
toilet
table
was
subsequently
found
a
note
addressed
to
grahame
within
ran
the
following
words
not
for
me
i
have
departed
of
my
own
free
will
rest
satisfied
in
this
that
the
life
bestowed
by
my
creator
will
not
beshortened
by
a
despairing
hand
one
word
of
solemn
warning
inquire
not
be
content
that
there
is
a
mystery
do
not
seek
to
draw
a
veil
from
that
which
hidden
can
not
wound
you
but
if
revealed
would
destroy
you
forget
me
so
she
was
gone
grahame
after
perusing
this
strange
and
to
her
mind
incomprehensible
epistle
concluded
to
take
no
step
in
the
matter
until
she
had
consulted
with
upon
the
subject
such
undignified
behaviour
on
the
part
of
her
eldest
daughter
was
unpardonable
margaret
thought
that
her
mother
had
adopted
quite
the
proper
course
to
pursue
malcolm
was
out
of
town
for
a
few
days
and
evangeline
upon
her
knees
implored
truebody
to
accompany
her
over
london
in
search
of
her
absent
sister
truebody
in
deep
tribulation
promised
everything
and
did
nothing
yes
she
did
one
thing
she
kept

otway
so
lotte
clinton
began
the
world
afresh
her
prospects
were
newer
and
brighter
since
she
had
been
flung
abruptly
and
rudely
upon
the
hard
world
she
had
not
known
such
true
comfort
and
happiness
as
she
now
enjoyed
the
death
of
her
parents
within
a
few
days
of
each
other
had
left
her
and
her
brother
her
senior
only
some
fifteen
months
utterly
destitute
the
disinterested
charity
of
a
neighbouring
humble
tradesman
who
had
known
something
of
the
family
in
better
times
not
only
provided
the
expenses
of
the
double
funeral
but
paused
not
until
it
had
placed
the
boy
in
a
office
and
the
girl
at
a
as
an
apprentice
for
three
years
in
the
house
in
those
three
years
lotte
had
been
trained
to
exist
with
as
few
hours
nightly
sleep
as
it
was
possible
for
her
young
nature
to
sustain
without
actually
sinking
under
it
but
she
had
acquired
the
whole
mystery
of
and
some
little
knowledge
of
dressmaking
when
the
term
of
her
apprenticeship
expired
she
went
through
the
routine
of
day
work
until
her
skill
and
the
known
power
she
had
of
working
long
after
midnight
and
rising
with
the
sun
enabled
her
to
ask
for
and
to
obtain
her
work
at
home
the
advantages
afforded
her
by
this
arrangement
were
that
she
saved
the
time
occupied
in
passing
to
and
from
her
place
of
business
and
she
was
spared
exposure
to
insult
on
her
nightly
return
to
her
humble
lodging
when
our
tale
opened
she
was
occupied
in
making
those
pretty
blonde
flowered
fronts
worn
by
ladies
as
the
inner
adornment
of
their
bonnets
for
making
up
these
she
was
paid
at
the
rate
of
and
for
some
per
at
this
miserable
pay
she
had
to
rise
with
the
dawn
and
work
until
past
the
hour
of
midnight
to
earn
even
a
scanty
a
fair
creature
consulting
her
mirror
has
with
gratified
pride
observed
the
becoming
properties
of
the
small
and
pretty
addition
to
her
but
how
very
few
have
reflected
that
their
own
efforts
to
procure
it
as
cheaply
as
possible
have
helped
to
hurry
many
a
poor
exhausted
careworn
sister
into
the
crowded
paths
of
sin
or
into
a
pauper
grave
lotte
was
rapid
with
her
needle
and
was
full
of
that
she
might
be
she
possessed
great
powers
of
endurance
and
to
preserve
her
independence
she
taxed
those
powers
to
the
utmost
no
one
but
herself
knew
what
privations
she
had
undergone
no
one
but
herself
could
tell
of
the
hardships
she
had
faced
struggled
with
without
a
despairing
sigh
and
had
surmounted
until
the
cruel
circumstances
succeeding
the
fire
had
ruthlessly
dragged
from
her
all
hope
now
her
trials
and
her
miseries
seemed
to
have
vanished
she
had
not
to
work
so
hard
for
she
was
far
better
paid
and
if
her
old
habit
of
early
rising
still
adhered
to
her
she
laid
her
pretty
happy
face
upon
her
soft
pillow
at
least
an
hour
before
midnight
her
furniture
was
all
her
own
too
now
to
the
kind
liberality
of
flora
wilton
she
was
indebted
for
that
and
she
had
at
least
a
sovereign
by
her
for
an
emergency
she
had
begun
to
deposit
in
a
savings
bank
already
she
had
a
plan
daintily
conceived
which
involved
a
fair
amount
of
poetical
justice
she
had
indomitable
perseverance
and
if
events
unforeseen
and
uncontrollable
did
not
occur
she
fully
resolved
to
carry
it
out
her
room
her
one
room
for
she
had
only
one
was
a
little
picture
so
clean
so
tidy
so
prettily
arranged
it
was
there
was
her
table
with
its
two
flaps
so
that
if
she
felt
lonely
and
somewhat
disposed
to
turn
with
liberal
hand
her
economy
aside
it
would
accommodate
a
visitor
ay
actually
company
then
in
addition
to
her
neat
set
of
chairs
there
was
a
sofa
which
by
a
marvel
of
mechanical
ingenuity
was
converted
at
night
into
a
pretty
little
bedstead
there
was
upon
the
floor
a
carpet
upon
the
flowered
walls
a
picture
or
two
not
of
much
value
but
they
added
to
the
liveliness
of
the
room
she
had
too
a
charming
little
canary
such
a
dear
tiltle
which
chirruped
and
sang
to
her
all
the
long
day
looking
at
her
every
now
and
then
and
calling
to
her
with
as
knowing
an
expression
in
his
little
bright
eye
as
if
he
were
that
young
smart
though
anky
grocer
himself
round
the
corner
who
never
served
her
with
sugar
but
he
gazed
upon
her
as
if
like
the
genuine
he
was
a
long
drawn
there
were
flowers
in
the
window
she
was
very
fond
of
flowers
she
could
not
afford
the
more
expensive
kinds
but
as
it
was
she
delighted
in
tending
her
geraniums
her
mignionette
her
fuchsias
and
her
trained
convolvuli
altogether
in
her
eyes
her
room
was
an
earthly
paradise
she
almost
sighed
with
too
much
happiness
as
at
times
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
from
her
work
to
gaze
around
if
charley
could
only
see
me
here
how
happy
he
would
be
she
would
often
say
to
herself
and
then
she
would
pray
with
earnest
fervour
that
he
might
soon
be
restored
to
her
as
yet
she
had
not
had
a
visitor
flora
was
away
in
the
country
hal
vivian
she
had
expected
to
call
if
only
to
say
do
you
do
but
he
had
never
been
and
bantom
who
had
promised
to
return
the
visit
which
lotte
full
of
gratitude
and
thankfulness
to
her
for
her
motherly
kindness
in
her
distress
had
paid
had
not
yet
put
in
an
appearance
several
times
when
a
loud
ring
came
to
bell
she
ran
with
a
light
step
and
a
beating
heart
down
the
stairs
to
answer
the
door
expecting
to
see
some
loved
face
reward
her
hopeful
anticipations
but
it
was
only
milk
or
a
boy
to
bring
her
a
fresh
supply
of
work
and
take
away
that
which
she
had
done
she
would
return
up
to
her
room
with
just
a
little
bit
of
a
sigh
and
take
refuge
once
more
in
the
sanguine
belief
that
some
one
would
come
to
see
her
and
that
before
long
she
little
dreamed
all
this
while
that
there
was
on
the
to
find
her
one
who
was
fully
as
anxious
to
become
a
visitor
to
her
as
she
could
be
to
receive
one
she
was
all
unconscious
that
her
round
attractive
face
had
won
the
heart
of
heir
of
the
haughty
that
is
so
much
of
the
article
as
he
possessed
alas
too
like
many
others
of
his
sex
as
far
as
woman
was
concerned
his
heart
greatly
resembled
a
cabbage
luxuriant
in
leaf
but
without
the
solid
centre
which
was
necessary
to
make
it
of
value
to
the
possessor
she
had
no
inkling
that
while
she
longed
for
some
face
bearing
a
kind
expression
to
come
shining
through
her
doorway
that
a
suitor
for
her
love
was
roaming
through
the
more
retired
of
the
streets
examining
apartments
to
let
making
kind
inquiries
after
imaginary
persons
of
impatient
landladies
in
the
strong
hope
that
he
should
at
last
shining
through
the
to
her
as
though
by
the
most
charming
accident
in
the
world
but
this
swain
was
not
successful
something
more
than
the
reverse
for
he
pursued
his
investigation
in
a
manner
so
peculiar
that
in
several
cases
he
was
suspected
of
being
after
the
or
any
stray
purse
or
plate
instead
of
the
lodgings
and
was
consequently
answered
with
abruptness
not
permitted
to
be
left
by
himself
for
an
instant
and
was
shown
to
the
door
with
all
possible
speed
in
other
instances
he
was
imagined
to
be
an
individual
shrinking
from
an
interview
with
sharp
and
urgent
creditors
whose
claims
he
could
not
liquidate
in
nearly
every
case
he
was
considered
impertinently
inquisitive
and
received
monosyllables
in
reply
but
not
in
satisfaction
of
the
object
of
his
questions
as
that
formed
precisely
the
point
upon
which
the
interrogated
joined
issue
with
him
especially
if
the
lady
with
diminished
resources
who
let
apartments
to
help
out
her
income
or
who
had
room
than
she
wanted
happened
to
have
a
daughter
old
enough
to
be
thought
of
by
young
men
and
to
think
of
them
then
malcolm
grahame
observed
as
he
questioned
the
elderly
face
redden
her
brow
contract
her
lips
purse
up
her
eyes
brighten
and
her
conversational
powers
stricken
with
a
sudden
frost
and
he
found
himself
gradually
backed
inch
by
inch
down
the
stairs
along
the
passage
too
narrow
mostly
to
be
dignified
with
the
name
of
a
hall
until
he
was
fairly
in
the
street
and
then
the
door
was
slammed
in
his
face
rude
thought
he
odd
too
they
should
treat
a
person
of
my
standing
and
appearance
in
such
a
beastly
the
more
his
imagination
dwelt
upon
lotte
the
more
infatuated
he
grew
the
difficulties
thrown
in
his
path
in
his
endeavour
to
discover
her
served
but
to
add
to
the
flame
already
kindled
and
thus
much
time
that
ought
to
have
been
passed
at
oxford
was
spent
in
wandering
through
whole
streets
of
unlet
apartments
to
find
one
who
had
no
idea
of
his
existence
and
who
as
soon
as
his
identity
was
established
would
think
about
him
pretty
much
as
she
had
done
before
that
is
to
say
not
at
all
a
recent
effort
of
handicraft
had
been
purchased
by
a
lady
of
title
in
belgravia
and
requiring
other
articles
of
attire
for
her
sprigs
she
desired
that
the
person
young
or
old
who
had
made
the
articles
she
had
purchased
and
was
much
pleased
with
should
upon
a
certain
evening
after
dinner
wait
upon
her
to
take
her
instructions
delighted
with
the
taste
exhibited
in
the
things
she
had
bought
the
lady
concluded
that
the
same
excellent
fancy
would
be
displayed
by
the
young
person
in
whatever
was
made
under
her
own
directions
in
fact
that
by
such
a
mode
of
procedure
the
very
best
results
would
be
produced
she
was
therefore
very
particular
in
requesting
the
presence
of
the
actual
workwoman
her
wishes
were
conveyed
to
lotte
and
she
glad
of
a
little
change
readily
assented
to
attend
upon
the
lady
resolving
to
make
by
allowing
herself
plenty
of
time
something
more
than
a
mere
walk
of
her
journey
so
she
tied
on
the
prettiest
of
little
bonnets
we
must
tell
the
truth
so
as
to
cover
only
half
her
head
and
to
hide
that
graceful
turn
in
her
neck
which
without
shawl
or
bonnet
commanded
the
admiration
of
any
person
with
half
an
eye
for
beauty
of
form
and
she
donned
her
mantle
which
fell
so
gracefully
from
her
shoulders
giving
a
tantalising
suggestion
of
the
small
waist
it
concealed
from
view
but
not
from
the
imagination
and
she
drew
on
gradually
with
a
patience
and
perseverance
in
those
matters
the
small
kid
gloves
and
then
she
seized
her
little
morocco
hung
it
on
her
arm
and
sallied
forth
she
thought
with
a
smile
and
a
suppressed
sigh
no
one
has
been
to
pay
me
a
visit
it
consoles
me
to
think
i
have
a
visit
to
now
she
had
not
left
her
residence
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
hal
vivian
with
grave
and
thoughtful
face
called
at
her
residence
to
see
her
and
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
her
upon
a
subject
of
interest
to
her
and
of
moment
to
himself
he
was
vexed
to
find
that
she
was
out
but
on
learning
that
she
had
gone
to
eaton
square
he
said
it
was
probable
he
might
walk
in
that
direction
and
in
all
likelihood
he
should
see
her
he
therefore
declined
to
leave
a
message
perhaps
an
hour
had
elapsed
when
miss
bell
again
gave
forth
a
loud
peal
this
time
there
appeared
at
the
door
two
young
men
one
of
whom
inquired
for
lotte
with
great
earnestness
he
displayed
much
disappointment
when
told
that
though
the
young
lady
for
whom
he
inquired
certainly
lived
there
that
she
was
not
within
when
however
it
was
made
known
to
him
whither
she
had
gone
he
with
his
friend
at
once
departed
in
quest
of
her
now
as
though
visits
were
to
fall
on
lotte
as
thick
as
hail
during
her
absence
bantom
spruced
up
and
decorated
with
a
tall
shirt
collar
so
that
his
wife
laughed
until
she
absolutely
wept
as
she
walked
round
and
surveyed
him
when
dressed
presented
himself
at
her
abode
for
admission
but
he
had
been
observed
by
a
policeman
to
hang
round
the
door
for
at
least
five
minutes
before
he
selected
the
he
intended
to
manipulate
upon
and
when
apparently
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
pulled
it
out
with
such
tenderness
that
it
was
only
at
the
fourth
effort
a
slight
ensued
he
had
allowed
about
three
minutes
to
elapse
between
each
pull
a
quarter
was
therefore
very
nearly
consumed
before
the
door
was
opened
to
him
the
policeman
having
little
on
his
mind
and
nothing
to
do
but
to
crack
nuts
lessened
gradually
the
distance
between
himself
and
bantom
until
he
stood
at
his
shoulder
when
landlady
threw
wide
the
entrance
to
her
mansion
she
almost
fainted
at
beholding
the
strange
man
she
had
seen
a
short
time
previously
walking
slowly
up
and
down
opposite
her
house
seeming
to
examine
it
with
the
eye
of
a
practised
burglar
picking
out
its
most
vulnerable
part
and
with
him
a
policeman
a
variety
of
horrible
suggestions
presented
themselves
to
her
and
she
gasped
for
breath
without
being
able
to
utter
a
word
bantom
looked
slightly
bewildered
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
policeman
at
his
elbow
he
was
at
a
loss
to
conceive
his
object
in
pausing
there
and
waited
for
him
to
state
his
business
to
the
housekeeper
the
policeman
who
was
no
artist
in
his
profession
urged
by
a
sense
of
duty
and
a
presentiment
that
bantom
was
animated
by
a
hope
of
plunder
also
remained
silent
to
hear
what
bantom
had
to
say
for
himself
for
a
minute
therefore
the
three
gazed
upon
each
other
without
speaking
the
landlady
broke
ground
by
faintly
demanding
to
what
remarkable
event
she
might
attribute
the
honour
of
this
most
visit
whereupon
bantom
gracefully
resigned
to
x
the
privilege
of
speaking
first
a
privilege
which
was
immediately
accepted
and
used
in
directing
a
series
of
sharp
interrogatories
addressed
to
bantom
every
one
of
which
he
replied
to
with
skilful
evasion
the
officer
at
length
declared
himself
extremely
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
his
examination
and
requested
bantom
to
accompany
him
to
the
in
order
that
he
might
give
more
satisfactory
explanations
concerning
himself
to
the
inspector
on
duty
to
this
proposition
bantom
emphatically
declined
to
accede
he
declared
it
a
violation
of
the
liberty
of
the
subject
to
which
he
would
not
submit
and
as
x
endeavoured
to
enforce
his
suggestion
a
collision
ensued
landlady
when
she
saw
the
hand
upon
collar
and
hand
upon
the
belt
and
the
two
commence
to
revolve
with
frightful
rapidity
thought
it
prudent
to
take
no
further
part
in
the
interview
she
therefore
retired
closed
her
door
bolted
it
and
put
the
chain
up
she
ascended
to
the
room
above
and
peeped
over
a
blind
to
ascertain
what
followed
her
departure
she
heard
a
great
shuffling
of
feet
upon
the
pavement
and
the
roar
of
many
voices
there
were
frequent
heavy
bumps
at
the
street
door
as
of
human
bodies
swung
violently
against
it
the
knocker
rapped
at
these
times
untouched
by
mortal
hand
then
the
uproar
increased
grew
swelled
into
a
mighty
sound
and
at
last
she
saw
the
heels
of
bantom
quivering
in
the
air
waving
above
the
shoulders
of
five
policemen
who
were
bearing
him
off
in
triumph
to
that
audience
with
the
inspector
at
the
suggested
in
the
first
instance
by
x
but
which
bantom
had
so
obstinately
refused
to
attend
all
this
while
lotte
was
on
her
way
to
eaton
square
she
paused
occasionally
to
look
in
at
the
shops
the
and
the
commanding
the
largest
portion
of
her
attention
though
at
the
time
bantom
was
doing
desperate
battle
against
such
unequal
odds
she
was
steadfastly
regarding
a
large
variety
of
pipes
in
a
window
with
the
intention
of
one
day
selecting
one
and
making
him
a
present
of
it
she
went
on
and
reached
hyde
park
she
struck
across
towards
the
serpentine
the
sky
was
blue
clear
and
serene
the
air
was
balmy
and
the
soft
turf
green
and
smooth
the
throngs
moving
to
and
fro
in
carriages
and
on
foot
dressed
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
made
the
scene
busy
and
lively
and
she
tripped
on
full
of
joyful
tenderness
and
freshened
spirits
light
and
free
as
a
bird
the
route
she
had
determined
to
pursue
lay
along
the
path
on
the
banks
of
the
serpentine
river
over
the
bridge
and
so
towards
knightsbridge
as
she
went
on
she
admired
the
gay
equipages
and
the
superb
dresses
of
the
fair
creatures
borne
in
them
and
no
touch
of
envy
mingled
with
her
admiration
glad
of
heart
herself
she
was
delighted
to
see
how
smiling
and
happy
every
one
appeared
with
what
a
light
elastic
step
each
one
seemed
to
move
and
how
deliciously
the
breeze
wafted
to
her
ear
the
unsaddened
ring
of
childish
laughter
when
suddenly
she
came
upon
the
of
the
humane
society
it
stood
in
the
gloomy
shadow
of
a
cluster
of
trees
upon
the
bank
near
to
it
was
moored
a
boat
in
which
lay
at
rest
the
formidable
employed
to
rescue
the
drowning
or
to
bring
up
from
the
cold
depths
of
the
river
the
dead
a
cold
thrill
ran
through
her
frame
as
she
gazed
upon
it
and
she
hastened
on
the
hue
of
the
still
river
before
so
blue
and
sparkling
in
its
ripples
now
seemed
to
change
to
become
leaden
and
motionless
she
remembered
the
dark
night
when
with
cold
sinking
heart
she
hurried
to
leap
from
an
arched
height
into
a
chill
and
fatal
embrace
that
she
might
there
end
in
a
wakeless
sleep
her
sorrow
and
her
despair
she
remembered
the
sudden
grip
of
her
wrist
the
gentle
voice
in
her
ear
and
the
infinite
mercy
of
the
great
and
good
god
who
had
saved
her
in
the
very
moment
of
committing
a
mortal
sin
a
throng
of
tears
gushed
into
her
eyes
she
murmured
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
to
him
for
his
beneficence
to
her
and
a
blessing
on
hal
for
his
interposition
while
the
soft
words
of
gratefulness
yet
stirred
her
quivering
lips
her
tearful
eyes
fell
upon
the
pale
features
of
a
young
beautiful
and
elegantly
dressed
lady
who
was
passing
beneath
a
group
of
trees
seemingly
desirous
of
screening
herself
from
public
gaze
and
evidently
affected
with
the
deepest
sadness
oh
that
terrible
expression
of
despair
upon
her
pallid
face
that
aspect
of
blank
hopeless
desolation
which
the
most
accomplished
mime
or
the
vilest
cheat
could
never
simulate
how
sure
and
perfect
an
index
is
it
of
the
utter
misery
crushing
the
prostrated
heart
of
those
whose
countenances
bear
its
fearful
impress
lotte
recognised
it
instantly
she
felt
that
so
she
must
have
looked
when
her
wretchedness
had
reached
its
culminating
point
her
sympathy
prompted
her
to
speak
to
the
young
lady
but
as
she
advanced
with
this
purpose
she
perceived
that
the
object
of
her
interest
observing
her
hastily
retreated
and
hurried
away
in
the
direction
of
kensington
gardens
she
gazed
wistfully
after
her
and
felt
impelled
to
follow
for
she
knew
there
was
an
aching
heart
beating
against
a
prison
grate
from
which
it
longed
to
escape
she
would
with
earnest
fervour
have
done
her
best
to
pour
consolation
into
the
dull
ear
of
the
strange
lady
and
as
far
as
she
could
have
softened
the
anguish
of
her
racked
soul
but
the
young
and
evidently
girl
moved
so
quickly
away
that
she
was
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
in
less
than
a
minute
after
she
detected
that
she
had
attracted
attention
lotte
therefore
proceeded
upon
her
mission
was
received
with
magnificent
condescension
by
the
stately
mistress
of
the
splendid
mansion
to
whom
she
had
been
accredited
endured
much
patronage
as
she
took
her
instructions
was
honoured
with
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
piece
of
cake
after
her
walk
permitted
to
retire
at
the
proper
moment
was
winked
at
by
the
footman
who
conducted
her
out
and
who
thought
her
jewced
nice
gal
and
found
herself
in
the
square
uncertain
which
route
to
take
on
her
return
to
her
own
dear
little
paradise
of
a
room
her
decision
was
formed
for
her
she
had
been
unable
to
chase
from
her
brain
a
vision
of
the
pale
face
she
had
seen
in
the
park
it
haunted
her
from
the
moment
the
reality
faded
from
her
sight
it
settled
before
her
the
large
eyes
gazing
upon
her
own
sadly
and
steadfastly
while
she
listened
to
details
of
juvenile
dress
it
grew
brighter
and
more
vivid
when
alone
in
the
deepening
twilight
and
it
seemed
to
glow
with
brighter
aspect
as
she
turned
herself
to
retrace
her
steps
through
the
park
again
and
pass
the
spot
where
she
had
seen
the
wan
features
which
she
had
an
indistinct
undefined
impression
she
had
known
under
happier
circumstances
should
perhaps
be
less
anxious
about
her
she
thought
for
that
ugly
she
shuddered
preserve
her
from
seeking
rashly
such
a
grave
as
that
she
pressed
on
towards
the
spot
where
she
had
encountered
the
young
lady
who
had
so
strongly
and
so
strangely
excited
her
interest
on
reaching
it
she
was
scarcely
surprised
to
discern
in
the
murky
obscurity
occasioned
by
the
umbrageous
foliage
of
many
trees
whose
branches
intertwined
a
shadowy
phantom
like
a
female
pacing
agitatedly
on
the
narrow
pathway
beneath
lotte
glided
noiselessly
up
to
her
for
she
knew
that
she
now
beheld
the
same
young
creature
she
had
before
seen
though
her
mental
agony
expressed
by
her
excited
movements
appeared
to
have
increased
in
intensity
since
she
had
quitted
her
as
lotte
gained
her
side
she
heard
with
a
sharp
pang
her
choking
sob
of
acute
misery
she
saw
her
wring
her
hands
in
despairing
agony
and
then
lotte
placed
her
lingers
lightly
upon
her
shoulder
the
lady
turned
with
a
low
smothered
shriek
to
see
who
had
touched
her
but
on
finding
that
it
was
a
young
female
a
stranger
she
drew
herself
up
haughtily
and
said
in
a
low
grating
voice
do
you
want
with
me
lotte
quietly
took
a
firm
hold
of
her
elegant
mantle
and
then
replied
in
an
earnest
tone
me
you
are
smitten
by
some
terrible
replied
the
young
lady
coldly
as
lotte
paused
do
not
repel
me
she
cried
fervidly
do
not
i
am
aware
it
may
appear
intrusive
and
rude
in
me
to
trespass
upon
your
are
right
it
is
both
rude
and
intrusive
leave
me
interrupted
the
young
lady
a
little
vehemently
endeavouring
at
the
same
time
to
remove
her
mantle
from
grasp
but
she
retained
her
hold
and
continued
in
urgent
tones
heaven
is
my
witness
i
am
animated
by
no
common
motives
you
are
a
lady
i
am
humble
grief
knows
no
distinction
the
human
heart
is
susceptible
of
misery
though
a
diadem
may
glitter
upon
the
brow
of
its
possessor
the
rich
are
not
exempt
from
its
blight
even
though
it
be
the
common
inheritance
of
the
poor

the
young
lady
turned
her
unbending
head
away
still
cold
and
stern
by
a
rapid
movement
she
drew
a
purse
from
the
pocket
of
her
dress
and
offering
it
to
lotte
said
almost
harshly
it
and
leave
me
madam
madam
cried
lotte
passionately
not
misconstrue
me
you
are
a
woman
as
i
am
we
are
both
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
creator
he
gave
us
our
lives
to
hold
in
trust
not
to
fling
wildly
away
and
rush
unbidden
into
his
dread
the
startling
energy
of
tones
caused
the
young
lady
to
recede
a
pace
and
mutter
something
which
was
inaudible
lotte
in
her
excitement
changed
her
grip
from
the
mantle
to
the
wrist
of
the
young
creature
she
was
addressing
there
she
cried
in
a
low
tone
but
with
a
terrible
emphasis
she
pointed
to
the
dark
sluggish
mass
of
water
stretching
east
and
west
upon
that
dark
vaporous
river
the
graveyard
of
the
madly
despairing
i
stood
upon
the
brink
of
a
river
mightier
and
blacker
than
that
before
you
upon
its
very
edge
i
stood
prepared
to
spring
into
its
deadly
depths
because
i
was
friendless
homeless
hopeless
do
you
mark
me
the
haughty
girl
cowered
do
she
murmured
with
a
bitter
wail
of
sorrowing
distraction
even
such
as
now
burst
from
your
lips
i
was
about
to
leap
out
of
life
i
was
seized
by
the
wrist
as
i
now
seize
you
and
by
a
friend
to
shame
me
from
my
dreadful
purpose
god
had
sent
to
me
a
friend
as
as
he
now
sends
me
to
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
clasped
the
hands
of
the
young
lady
believe
that
though
humble
i
can
and
will
do
all
within
my
power
to
serve
you
to
console
you
to
soothe
the
dreadful
anguish
which
urges
you
to
crime
beyond
can
console
or
soothe
me
hoarsely
replied
the
young
lady
me
free
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
has
with
you
oh
it
has
with
you
urged
lotte
vehemently
glimmering
light
there
is
to
penetrate
the
foulest
vault
of
sin
and
despair
have
but
faith
in
me
and
i
will
show
you
though
it
be
as
a
star
shining
afar
the
beacon
of
hope
burning
steadily
perhaps
you
have
not
yet
tested
the
value
of
sincere
friendship
perhaps
you
know
not
what
peace
may
be
won
by
pouring
your
sorrows
in
a
tenderly
attentive
ear
or
confiding
your
fears
your
worst
forebodings
even
your
sins
for
alas
we
are
all
more
or
less
tainted
to
a
sympathising
the
young
lady
squeezed
hands
spasmodically
never
had
such
a
friend
i
know
not
what
it
means
she
said
her
lips
quivering
with
emotion
me
he
such
a
one
to
you
exclaimed
lotte
with
intense
eagerness
but
truthful
come
let
us
away
from
this
dark
lonely
place
come
with
me
for
so
long
as
you
will
i
live
by
myself
quite
quite
alone
no
one
visits
me
for
i
am
humble
very
humble
but
oh
i
am
happy
now
and
i
will
strive
to
bring
back
peacefulness
and
calm
to
your
poor
disturbed
heart
i
will
not
ask
you
one
word
about
the
past
i
will
not
seek
for
your
confidence
but
will
act
always
as
though
i
possessed
it
your
station
it
is
evident
is
far
higher
than
mine
but
you
can
think
me
a
foster
sister
though
still
in
all
tenderness
of
affection
and
loving
service
a
she
felt
the
limbs
of
the
young
stranger
tremble
she
saw
that
she
shook
like
an
aspen
from
head
to
foot
and
she
rose
up
to
catch
her
in
her
arms
for
she
knew
that
she
yearned
to
fall
within
them
and
weep
weep
long
and
bitterly
at
length
lotte
whose
eye
from
time
to
time
rested
painfully
upon
the
still
almost
river
passed
her
arm
gently
round
the
waist
of
the
young
lady
and
drew
her
softly
away
she
was
yet
sobbing
but
she
made
no
resistance
earnest
sincerity
had
subdued
her
haughty
pride
it
had
found
its
way
to
her
heart
and
to
her
reason
it
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
offered
a
future
where
before
all
had
been
blank
obscurity
it
opened
up
to
her
a
store
of
womanly
sympathy
and
service
which
until
now
she
had
credited
but
not
found
and
what
weighed
much
with
her
it
offered
her
with
life
a
secret
seclusion
for
that
was
now
as
needful
to
her
as
life
itself
and
so
she
accepted
the
new
position
as
though
she
had
suffered
herself
to
be
persuaded
and
had
yielded
yet
she
thought
as
she
went
on
clinging
to
supporting
arm
this
is
to
be
humble
how
large
the
price
paid
by
rank
to
become
ignorant
of
human
worth
the
group
of
trees
and
the
leaden
river
were
left
behind
and
the
two
young
creatures
upon
whom
the
shadows
of
fate
had
successively
so
darkly
fallen
moved
into
the
open
space
slowly
pursuing
the
pathway
leading
towards
the
glaring
lights
of
oxford
street
chapter
the
assault
and
the
rescue
permit
me
sir
to
pass
not
till
you
hear
of
your
good
fortune
my
dear
you
have
attracted
in
one
moment
what
hundreds
of
your
sex
have
twinkled
their
eyes
for
whole
years
in
vain
my
notice
i
will
bring
you
into
the
world
myself
your
made
sir
this
kind
of
conversation
is
new
to
me
i
insist
upon
passing
when
we
fellows
of
superior
class
show
ourselves
the
women
throw
themselves
at
us
pick
and
choose
is
the
way
and
happy
is
she
we
deign
to
catch
in
our
arms
attempts
to
lay
hold
of
her
bursts
into
tears
unheard
of
assurance
what
do
you
seer
in
me
to
encourage
such
insolence
or
is
it
the
very
baseness
of
you
nature
that
insults
a
woman
because
she
has
no
protection
advances
between
them
protection
is
not
so
distant
as
you
imagined
dibdin
jun
heart
out
of
its
own
sore
struggles
had
been
schooled
to
compassionate
deeply
and
tenderly
the
afflictions
and
trials
of
others
especially
of
her
own
sex
she
had
no
thought
in
taking
to
her
bosom
this
poor
wanderer
of
the
responsibility
she
was
entailing
upon
herself
the
cold
suggestions
of
worldly
prudence
and
the
heartless
promptings
of
mincing
propriety
had
no
voice
loud
enough
to
reach
her
ear
she
saw
only
that
one
lonely
helpless
pressed
as
she
had
been
ruthlessly
by
a
mad
despair
upon
the
brink
of
an
awful
abyss
would
spring
into
its
unfathomable
depths
if
she
stretched
not
forth
her
hand
to
hold
her
back
she
paused
not
in
her
impulse
to
save
this
young
forlorn
desolate
woman
to
ask
in
what
why
or
how
she
had
erred
or
to
reflect
whether
she
was
destitute
even
though
elegantly
dressed
and
if
so
that
her
noble
purpose
of
restoring
her
if
possible
back
to
the
sunny
paths
of
ife
could
only
be
accomplished
by
many
a
personal
sacrifice
no
not
one
selfish
thought
mingled
itself
with
her
sympathy
her
own
initiation
into
suffering
had
stimulated
her
unbiassed
by
any
personal
consideration
to
rescue
one
placed
in
a
like
peril
to
that
in
which
she
had
stood
and
she
was
prepared
to
conduct
the
young
stranger
to
her
own
abode
without
further
inquiry
without
stipulation
or
condition
rash
inconsiderate
cries
rigid
decorum
a
blessed
sample
of
pure
human
compassion
exclaims
old
but
alas
too
often
abused
philanthropy
the
young
stranger
read
human
nature
by
instinct
rather
than
by
experience
she
felt
assured
that
the
girl
who
had
pleaded
with
her
so
passionately
against
the
commission
of
her
meditated
sin
was
sincere
truthful
and
trustworthy
and
she
resolved
to
place
confidence
in
her
she
had
been
struck
by
the
words
live
by
myself
quite
quite
alone
no
one
visits
me
for
i
am
upon
them
had
followed
the
promise
of
the
tender
affectionate
loving
services
of
a
sister
and
those
words
had
conjured
up
before
her
eyes
a
young
loving
anxious
face
that
of
one
whose
gentle
heart
would
break
if
she
came
to
know
that
the
tenant
of
the
sick
couch
she
had
so
patiently
watched
had
perished
by
the
terrible
crime
of
then
she
found
it
impossible
to
resist
the
earnest
pleadings
of
her
new
found
friend
and
she
yielded
her
will
up
to
her
with
some
vague
notion
that
she
should
be
conducted
to
a
quiet
retired
place
where
her
friends
search
for
her
as
they
might
would
never
discover
her
they
proceeded
slowly
along
the
path
stretching
across
the
park
lotte
alone
sustaining
the
conversation
which
she
knew
how
to
shape
so
as
not
to
jar
upon
the
feelings
of
her
companion
she
tried
also
so
to
arrange
her
discourse
as
to
give
some
knowledge
of
her
occupation
and
style
of
life
that
the
young
lady
might
have
a
just
notion
of
the
new
home
she
was
going
to
and
how
it
was
supported
lotte
spoke
hopefully
and
cheerfully
of
the
future
even
though
she
extracted
not
a
sound
not
even
a
monosyllable
in
reply
but
she
was
not
disconcerted
at
this
for
she
knew
by
sad
experience
the
heart
of
the
young
mourner
upon
her
arm
was
too
full
for
speech
the
increasing
darkness
spreading
over
the
wide
treeless
expanse
contrasted
by
the
distant
lights
made
the
surrounding
place
seem
drear
and
caused
lotte
who
was
not
much
more
courageous
when
in
the
midst
of
a
wide
space
in
the
dark
than
most
of
her
sex
to
increase
her
speed
her
companion
who
had
drawn
a
thick
veil
down
over
her
face
completely
shrouding
her
features
offered
no
objection
to
this
change
in
their
pace
but
if
anything
appeared
desirous
of
accelerating
it
seemingly
wishful
now
she
had
decided
on
accepting
a
new
condition
of
life
to
hurry
to
it
so
as
to
escape
the
observation
of
the
outer
world
their
walk
thus
became
rapid
and
the
lights
drew
nearer
and
grew
brighter
suddenly
a
footstep
quick
and
light
sounded
immediately
behind
them
and
a
hand
touched
lotte
lightly
on
the
shoulder
she
turned
and
perceived
at
her
elbow
a
tall
moustached
gentleman
a
little
in
advance
of
two
others
arm
in
arm
who
were
following
him
up
he
addressed
lotte
a
hurry
you
are
in
my
dear
he
said
have
had
to
increase
my
pace
to
a
gallop
to
catch
you
walk
so
fast
i
beg
of
you
you
fatigue
me
and
do
you
know
that
disturbs
my
lotte
gazed
upon
him
with
inexpressible
astonishment
know
you
she
said
with
unequivocal
surprise
am
sure
you
know
me
you
have
mistaken
me
sir
for
some
other
the
man
bent
his
head
down
and
looked
closely
and
impertinently
at
her
face
he
appeared
rather
agreeably
surprised
by
its
prettiness
absurd
he
exclaimed
catching
hold
of
her
wrist
affectation
you
little
coy
queen
you
we
are
good
friends
you
know
of
he
tried
to
put
her
hand
within
his
arm
lotte
wrenched
her
hand
from
him
and
stamped
her
foot
indignantly
dare
you
touch
me
she
said
her
face
and
neck
becoming
a
brilliant
crimson
are
aware
that
i
am
an
entire
stranger
to
you
and
that
your
speaking
thus
to
me
is
an
little
pearl
exclaimed
the
man
with
a
slight
laugh
as
he
placed
himself
before
her
to
impede
her
advance
at
this
moment
his
companions
arrived
and
one
of
them
said
with
a
stupid
grin
brace
only
spoonly
vane
and
i
will
have
to
go
newmarket
for
the
lotte
felt
her
companion
shiver
shrink
cower
as
though
she
would
sink
into
the
earth
she
clung
tightly
desperately
to
lotte
and
in
a
low
hissing
whisper
she
murmured
sake
let
us
fly
aside
sir
cried
lotte
firmly
and
with
clear
tones
to
the
man
who
detained
her
us
pass
on
without
further
will
do
anything
in
the
world
my
little
pet
to
gratify
you
responded
the
man
whom
she
addressed
that
a
i
can
not
do
again
lotte
stamped
her
little
foot
angrily
you
shall
she
exclaimed
ruffled
dove
by
jupiter
exclaimed
her
tormentor
laughing
if
there
is
one
thing
i
love
to
see
beyond
aught
else
it
is
a
ruffled
dove
it
is
such
a
pretty
bird
and
it
swells
and
extends
its
feathers
and
struts
so
gloriously
i
feel
that
i
could
catch
it
in
my
arms
and
press
say
though
by
jove
here
spoonly
stop
suddenly
observed
the
person
who
had
before
spoken
know
this
young
lady
you
must
give
way
to
me
know
her
grahame
cried
the
man
he
addressed
as
spoonly
that
gives
an
interesting
turn
to
the
know
her
grahame
cried
the
third
individual
advancing
introduce
us
we
shall
make
a
blissful
termination
to
a
dull
barrack
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
companion
seemed
as
though
she
would
crawl
upon
the
earth
from
the
spot
it
was
the
honorable
lester
vane
who
spoke
lotte
was
at
a
loss
to
divine
why
she
betrayed
so
much
abject
fear
but
she
felt
that
it
called
upon
her
for
renewed
spirit
and
exertions
she
caught
a
firmer
hold
of
her
arm
and
pushing
her
first
assailant
out
of
her
path
hurried
on
but
he
instantly
pursued
and
caught
her
are
a
little
vixenish
fairy
he
said
like
vixens
i
have
a
filly
which
is
the
sweetest
creature
to
look
at
in
the
world
of
racers
but
she
has
a
temper
and
i
have
named
her
vixen
i
like
vixens
my
little
yacht
a
perfect
duck
upon
the
water
will
run
in
the
teeth
of
a
breeze
like
an
arrow
as
if
out
of
spite
i
have
named
her
vixen
i
finding
that
remonstrance
as
well
as
resistance
were
utterly
unavailing
lotte
screamed
for
assistance
loudly
and
vehemently
her
cry
was
so
sudden
so
unexpected
so
shrill
and
piercing
that
it
startled
even
those
men
against
whose
insults
it
was
directed
almost
instantly
from
a
hollow
the
shadowy
forms
of
two
men
appeared
dark
against
the
sky
both
gave
a
shout
and
in
another
moment
racing
like
deer
they
reached
the
side
of
lotte
and
her
companion
is
all
this
cried
one
of
the
new
arrivals
these
men
insulted
you
lotte
uttered
an
almost
hysterical
shriek
charley
she
cried
and
disengaging
herself
from
her
companion
she
threw
herself
upon
the
neck
of
her
brother
for
it
was
he
but
her
embrace
passionate
and
loving
as
it
was
lasted
but
an
instant
in
another
moment
she
had
again
possessed
herself
of
the
arm
of
the
young
lady
are
safe
now
oh
we
are
safe
now
she
cried
in
joyous
tones
should
think
so
muttered
charley
with
a
slight
swelling
of
the
throat
then
he
said
fellows
have
insulted
you
have
they
not
lotte
echoed
vane
fiercely
is
the
truer
and
the
better
word
exclaimed
companion
will
say
puppies
walk
on
lotte
dear
with
your
friend
said
charley
to
his
sister
will
join
you
presently
you
need
no
more
be
afraid
we
will
deal
with
these
lord
spoonly
for
he
was
a
lord
placed
himself
directly
in
front
of
charley
dirty
clerk
he
cried
dare
you
apply
such
epithets
to
gentlemen
you
see
that
we
are
three
to
two
and
therefore
could
take
advantage
of
your
want
of
strength
by
the
pair
of
you
but
i
will
prevent
that
by
taking
upon
myself
to
chastise
you
charley
and
by
ducking
your
friend
vane
and
grahame
hold
that
fellow
while
i
give
this
one
a
as
he
spoke
he
suddenly
seized
charley
by
the
collar
and
raised
his
light
malacca
cane
to
inflict
severe
punishment
upon
him
but
as
it
descended
it
was
caught
by
companion
and
twisted
out
of
lord
hand
at
the
same
time
he
caught
his
lordship
by
the
neck
jerked
him
from
his
grip
of
charley
and
lashed
him
with
his
own
cane
until
he
absolutely
roared
from
pain
charley
in
the
meanwhile
attacked
vane
but
that
honourable
gentleman
parleyed
he
objected
to
a
fistic
encounter
and
submitted
to
say
was
sorry
for
what
had
rather
than
do
battle
with
his
hands
he
would
not
have
hesitated
an
instant
let
him
have
justice
with
the
small
sword
or
the
pistol
to
have
confronted
his
antagonist
but
then
charley
was
not
a
person
so
he
believed
whom
he
could
meet
on
such
terms
and
therefore
to
avoid
the
vulgar
appearance
of
maltreatment
upon
his
handsome
face
he
said
here
my
man
to
stand
up
and
fight
like
a
couple
of
boxers
is
not
to
my
taste
and
is
merely
ridiculous
where
our
physical
powers
appear
so
unequal
therefore
i
say
that
i
am
sorry
the
young
ladies
were
offended
they
were
only
accosted
in
joke
and
nothing
occurred
to
make
that
foolish
young
creature
scream
as
she
did
surveyed
him
with
a
look
of
disdain
he
waved
his
hand
contemptously
mark
he
said
will
overtake
the
girls
i
do
not
think
these
fellows
will
trouble
us
any
mark
as
charley
styled
his
friend
put
the
cane
to
his
knee
broke
it
into
two
pieces
and
uttering
a
few
indignant
comments
flung
it
towards
his
prostrate
antagonist
he
then
took
arm
and
accompanied
him
in
the
same
direction
as
lotte
and
her
companion
had
pursued
they
were
hardly
gone
when
a
man
came
up
to
where
lester
vane
was
bending
over
his
friend
who
had
been
most
severely
thrashed
he
touched
his
hat
to
vane
saying
me
sir
what
has
happened
scoundrel
cried
vane
passionately
ought
to
have
been
here
before
this
to
have
given
a
thrashing
to
a
couple
of
ruffians
who
have
assaulted
us
however
you
may
do
some
good
yet
hurry
along
yon
path
you
will
overtake
two
men
they
will
join
two
girls
see
where
they
go
to
and
bring
back
word
to
me
be
particular
in
the
address
and
ascertain
that
you
are
correct
be
off
with
you
the
man
touched
his
hat
and
hurried
after
charley
and
his
companion
in
the
meantime
charley
had
overtaken
lotte
in
a
few
brief
words
he
explained
to
her
that
he
had
been
to
new
york
and
having
succeeded
in
aiding
an
officer
to
capture
the
person
of
whom
he
had
been
sent
in
quest
he
had
immediately
returned
with
the
prisoner
to
england
on
board
the
vessel
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
fellow
who
he
said
strangely
enough
turned
out
to
be
the
son
of
the
person
in
whose
house
lotte
had
lodged
when
he
left
england
and
he
had
broken
to
him
as
well
as
he
could
the
pecuniary
distress
into
which
the
family
had
been
plunged
but
he
was
not
prepared
to
find
that
the
house
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
and
his
relatives
dispersed
he
knew
not
where
this
gentleman
said
lotte
mark
wilton
i
presume
said
charley
he
is
anxious
to
have
his
mind
set
at
rest
about
his
father
and
lotte
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
there
was
light
enough
to
see
that
his
countenance
much
resembled
save
that
it
was
of
course
manly
in
all
its
points
and
his
skin
was
browned
by
exposure
to
the
sun
to
say
this
is
to
suggest
that
he
was
a
very
handsome
young
fellow
and
so
lotte
thought
the
more
she
looked
at
him
it
was
satisfactory
to
think
that
one
so
as
he
had
lifted
his
strong
right
arm
in
her
defence
and
she
resolved
when
an
opportunity
offered
to
work
some
little
article
of
use
and
present
him
with
it
in
testimony
of
her
appreciation
of
his
valour
she
felt
a
pleasure
too
in
telling
him
that
his
father
had
become
the
possessor
of
a
large
fortune
that
he
lived
in
a
fine
house
that
flora
was
now
a
lady
and
that
he
would
become
a
grand
gentleman
mark
listened
with
evident
surprise
but
with
no
display
of
emotion
and
he
took
down
the
address
of
the
house
in
the
park
tenanted
by
his
father
that
he
might
proceed
there
that
night
or
rather
immediately
on
reaching
oxford
street
beyond
this
point
lotte
would
not
permit
her
brother
to
accompany
her
me
not
wherefore
charley
she
said
know
my
address
and
when
you
come
to
see
me
tomorrow
or
next
day
at
furthest
then
i
will
explain
much
that
may
seem
strange
and
inexplicable
to
you
charley
clinton
had
too
much
confidence
in
his
sister
to
ask
a
question
or
to
press
his
desire
to
accompany
her
to
her
lodging
he
therefore
bade
her
good
night
without
putting
a
question
respecting
or
making
any
allusion
to
the
young
lady
who
was
with
her
and
he
promised
to
call
upon
her
not
on
the
following
day
but
the
day
succeeding
mark
wilton
also
took
his
farewell
of
her
but
now
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
her
face
and
he
saw
her
bright
eye
her
cheek
flushed
with
excitement
and
the
pure
ingenuous
expression
upon
her
pretty
face
he
mentally
promised
himself
that
the
parting
now
taking
place
should
not
be
for
long
at
first
is
an
open
question
it
certainly
is
subjected
in
this
country
to
a
wholesale
doubt
while
in
the
warmer
climes
of
the
sunny
south
it
is
an
every
hour
occurrence
here
where
we
take
impressions
with
a
qualification
it
is
considered
almost
apocryphal
that
a
man
or
woman
should
fall
in
love
with
one
of
the
opposite
sex
the
moment
they
cast
eyes
upon
each
other
yet
it
is
not
deemed
wonderful
that
persons
seeing
an
article
which
at
the
first
glance
strikes
them
as
being
beautiful
should
conceive
instantly
a
desire
to
possess
it
and
call
it
their
own
why
should
there
be
a
difference
between
the
emotions
raised
by
the
inanimate
and
the
animate
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
love
which
is
clothed
with
passion
springs
into
existence
at
the
first
sight
of
the
object
although
other
causes
may
be
afterwards
attributed
and
proofs
may
be
adduced
that
it
was
of
slow
growth
fostered
and
increased
by
charms
freshly
and
continuously
developed
but
the
fact
of
the
first
impression
calling
love
into
existence
we
venture
to
think
remains
indisputable
mark
was
perhaps
unconscious
of
the
effect
which
expressive
and
attractive
face
had
really
upon
him
he
saw
that
she
was
pretty
and
that
her
manner
was
agreeable
he
thought
he
should
like
to
see
her
again
he
felt
almost
instantly
after
he
had
entertained
that
thought
that
he
must
see
her
again
and
as
he
pressed
her
soft
hand
and
gazed
into
her
clear
mild
eyes
he
resolved
that
he
would
see
her
again
and
so
they
parted
lotte
silently
sharing
his
impressions
the
groom
despatched
by
lester
vane
to
follow
charley
and
mark
was
embarrassed
by
perceiving
the
two
young
men
suddenly
proceed
in
opposite
directions
while
the
young
ladies
took
a
wholly
different
course
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
follow
them
all
so
he
decided
upon
following
the
females
he
shrewdly
surmised
that
the
females
being
alone
would
proceed
home
and
that
where
the
females
lived
the
young
men
were
likely
to
visit
and
thus
at
some
future
time
if
needful
might
be
tracked
to
their
own
abodes
he
followed
unobserved
lotte
and
her
young
companion
to
the
house
in
which
the
former
resided
and
watched
them
in
then
he
carefully
noted
down
the
name
of
the
street
and
the
number
of
the
house
but
although
he
went
to
butcher
and
baker
and
publican
he
failed
to
ascertain
name
he
returned
therefore
to
the
hotel
where
he
knew
he
should
find
his
master
with
all
the
information
he
could
obtain
and
now
lotte
was
at
home
in
her
own
little
room
her
candle
lighted
and
the
door
locked
she
was
alone
with
her
new
acquaintance
she
gently
forced
her
to
a
seat
upon
the
sofa
she
said
in
soft
tones
purposely
made
so
that
she
might
give
strength
and
encouragement
to
the
young
lady
to
speak
is
my
home
all
my
home
for
the
limits
of
my
property
are
bounded
by
these
walls
but
here
i
sit
the
day
long
employed
at
my
needle
the
song
of
my
little
bird
ringing
joyously
in
my
ears
the
bright
sky
shining
beyond
my
windows
the
fresh
air
coming
in
among
my
flowers
and
being
so
fortunate
as
to
have
no
lack
of
employment
i
am
as
happy
as
the
day
is
she
paused
and
looked
at
her
companion
her
hand
was
to
her
face
her
bowed
head
yet
partly
concealed
by
her
veil
lotte
knelt
suddenly
but
softly
at
her
feet
and
took
both
her
hands
in
hers
is
not
so
long
she
said
in
yet
lower
tones
i
was
waked
in
my
sleep
by
the
wild
cry
of
fire
the
house
in
which
i
dwelt
was
a
mass
of
living
flame
the
noble
intrepidity
of
young
vivian
you
do
not
know
him
ah
he
is
such
a
fine
youth
saved
my
life
circumstances
placed
me
where
this
dire
calamity
most
deeply
affected
me
what
shall
i
say
i
became
a
hopeless
homeless
outcast
i
sought
refuge
from
my
despair
in
an
attempt
to
die
by
my
own
hand
yet
i
am
here
i
can
wear
a
smile
on
my
face
a
song
is
ever
on
my
lips
and
i
have
a
contented
heart
nay
let
your
eyes
rest
on
mine
there
is
hope
for
all
hope
for
the
most
despairing
hope
even
for
those
whose
crimes
seem
most
to
repel
it
will
you
believe
that
for
you
only
there
is
no
hope
on
this
earth
not
on
this
earth
murmured
the
young
stranger
plaintively
this
earth
and
there
even
where
you
least
expect
it
cried
lotte
with
energy
pointing
heavenward
then
she
raised
her
hands
and
gently
unfastened
the
superb
brooch
which
confined
the
mantle
worn
by
her
companion
letting
her
garment
fall
from
her
shoulders
behind
her
where
she
sat
me
she
said
would
not
offend
you
nor
would
i
seem
troublesomely
attentive
but
i
have
elevated
myself
to
the
post
of
and
i
wish
to
perform
the
duties
i
have
as
she
said
this
she
with
the
same
gentle
violence
which
forbade
the
impulsive
resistance
offered
slightly
by
the
young
lady
removed
her
bonnet
and
the
two
girls
now
looked
into
each
eyes
with
unimpeded
gaze
lotte
saw
the
sharp
traces
of
recent
illness
upon
the
pale
features
of
the
young
lady
as
strongly
as
the
lines
which
developed
hopeless
woe
and
her
heart
was
drawn
yet
closer
to
her
new
companion
she
saw
that
her
features
were
beautiful
she
detected
in
the
thin
aquiline
nose
the
small
ear
the
delicate
lips
and
the
exquisitely
transparent
skin
the
evidences
of
aristocratic
birth
she
detected
also
that
the
impression
she
had
previously
entertained
of
having
before
somewhere
seen
the
face
on
which
now
she
gazed
was
confirmed
and
she
said
quietly
have
seen
you
have
said
the
young
lady
laconically
knew
it
but
where
i
can
not
remember
i
recollect
your
face
well
and
where
i
saw
it
was
in
the
garden
in
the
rear
of
lotte
clasped
her
hands
together
she
remembered
the
in
the
garden
the
group
and
most
of
all
that
proud
young
beauty
who
stood
among
all
as
it
then
seemed
the
of
the
and
was
the
prostrate
agonized
being
before
her
that
same
haughty
girl
she
gazed
on
her
intently
alas
yes
it
was
she
but
what
a
wreck
in
a
period
so
brief
she
could
scarcely
credit
the
evidence
of
her
senses
scarce
believe
that
splendid
loveliness
such
as
she
had
seen
admired
could
become
so
bruised
and
shattered
as
this
which
she
now
saw
before
her
she
remained
silent
for
a
minute
steadfastly
gazing
upon
her
and
then
she
said
then
are
she
hesitated
the
young
lady
compressed
her
hands
together
as
if
with
sudden
agony
and
in
broken
accents
murmured
grahame
there
was
again
a
silence
and
then
lotte
looked
up
wistfully
in
her
face
and
said
must
have
suffered
deeply
dreadfully
but
pray
believe
the
worst
to
be
past
look
upon
me
as
a
trustful
loving
faithful
attendant
in
whom
you
may
confide
safely
so
much
as
you
may
see
fit
to
reveal
i
ask
no
more
i
will
preserve
your
secret
faithfully
and
do
all
all
that
i
can
to
bring
to
you
peace
and
then
helen
fell
upon
her
neck
and
wept
a
long
long
passion
of
tears
and
when
the
fount
was
exhausted
she
in
broken
tones
and
disjointed
words
and
with
sobs
and
groans
revealed
all
to
lotte
more
far
more
than
ever
she
had
breathed
to
mortal
before
lotte
listened
with
breathless
attention
sometimes
in
astonishment
at
others
in
fright
but
when
half
fainting
the
worst
part
of
the
history
was
confessed
by
helen
she
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
and
wept
with
her
a
error
out
of
a
love
oh
it
was
not
unpardonable
least
of
all
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
with
a
young
and
loving
heart
it
was
far
into
the
night
before
helen
laid
her
wearied
frame
down
upon
humble
couch
the
tender
and
compassionate
girl
made
a
pretence
of
arranging
her
little
domestic
matters
so
that
she
did
not
retire
with
her
but
busied
herself
about
the
room
until
she
perceived
that
utterly
worn
out
and
exhausted
helen
had
fallen
into
a
slumber
then
she
knelt
down
by
the
modest
bedside
and
in
humble
intercession
prayed
long
and
earnestly
for
her
then
with
calmer
heart
and
quieter
mind
she
sate
herself
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
watched
in
silence
the
sad
face
of
the
pale
and
haggard
sleeper
chapter
the
gold
and
the
alloy
keep
your
eye
on
him
the
man
avoids
me
knows
that
i
now
know
him
watch
him
as
you
would
watch
the
wild
boar
when
he
make
against
you
in
the
gap
like
him
he
must
be
speared
he
stands
between
me
and
a
brave
inheritance
i
may
depend
on
you
too
late
to
doubt
it
let
no
foolish
pity
shake
your
bosom
byron
the
flight
of
helen
grahame
from
her
home
was
not
followed
by
a
convulsion
of
the
household
its
internal
economy
proceeded
with
the
same
regularity
as
before
grahame
her
grand
and
beautiful
eldest
daughter
the
pride
of
her
family
would
it
was
only
natural
to
expect
have
been
overwhelmed
by
agony
distress
apprehension
and
unutterable
woe
at
her
mysterious
bereavement
love
of
offspring
is
the
prominent
element
of
maternity
a
is
a
most
loving
mother
though
its
nature
is
none
of
the
tenderest
grahame
might
reasonably
be
credited
with
much
mental
suffering
in
consequence
of
the
flight
of
her
child
considering
too
how
elegant
how
accomplished
how
handsome
that
child
was
to
say
that
she
remained
unaffected
by
any
of
the
emotions
commonly
produced
by
such
an
event
would
be
perhaps
advancing
too
much
to
say
that
she
displayed
none
of
them
no
not
one
is
only
truth
whatever
might
have
been
stirred
up
in
the
inner
recesses
of
a
nature
whose
depths
no
mortal
save
herself
had
plumbed
remained
concealed
she
permitted
no
line
of
anxious
care
to
invade
the
regularity
of
her
smooth
brow
nor
did
she
allow
her
coldly
placid
bearing
or
the
existing
arrangements
governing
her
daily
movements
to
undergo
any
change
miss
grahame
had
left
her
home
whither
she
had
gone
wherefore
or
in
what
manner
she
considered
from
her
point
of
view
to
be
that
young
business
alone
she
was
herself
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
offer
explanations
to
any
one
upon
domestic
occurrences
as
well
might
such
a
surrender
of
dignity
be
expected
from
imperial
majesty
to
the
inquiries
of
friends
it
would
be
enough
to
say
that
miss
grahame
was
absent
and
that
was
the
only
decided
step
she
determined
upon
taking
in
the
really
terrible
event
she
would
it
is
true
have
gladly
plied
her
servants
with
the
waters
of
lethe
so
that
the
past
which
in
any
way
took
in
miss
grahame
might
be
forgotten
by
them
but
she
made
no
allusion
to
her
and
discharging
at
a
notice
chayter
maid
sternly
forbade
her
own
attendant
or
any
other
member
of
the
household
to
repeat
her
name
in
her
presence
margaret
grahame
wasted
not
her
powers
of
imagination
in
endeavouring
to
divine
why
her
sister
helen
had
fled
she
rather
looked
upon
the
circumstance
as
one
that
had
rid
her
of
a
formidable
rival
and
she
fixed
her
sluggish
single
thought
yet
more
steadfastly
upon
the
young
duke
of
allborne
malcolm
exclusively
under
the
control
of
his
mother
when
he
heard
from
her
his
flight
at
her
desire
moved
not
with
a
view
of
tracing
the
fugitive
he
thought
her
departure
odd
and
wondered
what
it
could
all
mean
but
beyond
an
undefined
feeling
of
surprise
mingled
with
a
vague
anxiety
he
was
not
more
affected
than
if
some
attendant
pertaining
to
the
household
from
childhood
had
mysteriously
disappeared
he
had
been
from
early
boyhood
at
public
schools
and
had
met
his
sister
only
in
the
vacations
at
which
periods
their
intercourse
under
the
forms
of
domestic
etiquette
laid
down
by
grahame
for
the
observance
of
her
children
was
not
more
affectionate
in
its
nature
than
if
they
had
been
ceremonious
acquaintances
it
is
the
common
and
natural
tendency
of
public
education
that
is
the
system
which
removes
a
child
from
home
influences
to
detach
or
diminish
filial
and
fraternal
love
the
young
heart
always
seeking
for
something
to
love
fastens
upon
objects
with
which
it
comes
in
daily
contact
love
of
kindred
is
weakened
in
the
personal
attachments
formed
at
school
and
as
during
the
progress
to
man
or
womanhood
the
opportunities
for
correcting
this
evil
are
rather
lessened
by
the
extra
studies
imposed
the
youth
of
both
sexes
usually
terminate
the
educational
career
with
a
strong
impression
that
parents
are
exacting
on
the
side
the
having
a
predominant
passion
for
stinginess
and
on
the
that
has
a
great
many
ridiculous
notions
and
is
only
another
form
of
the
odious
grim
feminine
tyrant
from
whose
rigorous
despotism
she
has
been
just
emancipated
perhaps
therefore
it
is
not
so
surprising
that
malcolm
grahame
went
out
to
dine
with
some
friends
in
the
guards
on
the
day
of
his
flight
his
equanimity
being
not
much
more
disturbed
than
usual
evangeline
was
the
only
one
who
appeared
to
feel
acutely
and
to
see
the
affair
in
its
true
light
but
then
she
was
considered
to
be
of
weak
intellect
it
was
a
common
thing
for
her
to
violate
all
her
gentle
loving
nature
her
soft
womanly
sympathies
impelled
her
to
do
this
and
her
absurdities
as
her
mamma
styled
the
sweet
evidences
of
her
affectionate
disposition
were
allowed
to
exhibit
themselves
only
on
sufferance
on
this
occasion
however
she
displayed
such
frantic
inconsolable
grief
that
she
was
dismissed
harshly
to
her
own
room
and
was
ordered
to
remain
there
until
she
could
quit
it
with
a
face
serene
and
passionless
upon
which
remained
no
traces
of
the
suffering
her
flight
had
occasioned
her
grahame
had
not
been
communicated
with
his
first
impulse
was
to
telegraph
to
him
to
return
instantly
to
london
upon
second
thoughts
she
decided
to
await
his
return
with
him
she
acted
as
with
others
she
simply
expressed
her
will
when
she
adopted
a
course
of
action
it
did
not
cross
her
that
grahame
might
object
to
her
mode
of
proceeding
in
respect
to
disappearance
but
if
it
had
it
would
not
have
influenced
her
it
was
enough
that
she
considered
the
course
she
had
pursued
the
proper
one
grahame
stayed
away
from
london
longer
than
was
expected
freed
from
embarrassments
he
played
the
lord
in
his
haughtiest
and
worst
aspect
his
harshness
and
his
despotic
tyranny
had
obtained
for
him
an
outward
show
of
slavish
deference
with
a
fierce
of
mortal
hatred
this
bowing
down
and
worshipping
had
him
and
he
returned
to
his
london
mansion
swelled
in
feeling
to
the
dimensions
of
a
mighty
noble
it
was
not
until
he
presided
at
the
dinner
table
that
he
noticed
the
absence
of
his
daughter
helen
it
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
still
too
ill
to
leave
her
chamber
nature
asserting
her
right
to
be
heard
even
in
the
icy
dominion
of
stronghold
touched
his
heart
he
felt
the
twinge
and
grahame
respecting
her
the
servants
waiting
at
table
glanced
at
each
eyes
margaret
and
malcolm
sat
coldly
immovable
gentle
bosom
heaved
and
fell
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
and
looked
down
striving
to
restrain
the
hot
tears
which
sprang
up
to
her
trembling
lids
grahame
displayed
not
the
slightest
perceptible
emotion
but
replied
to
her
question
by
saying
in
a
tone
which
he
knew
was
intended
to
preclude
further
inquiry
at
that
time
grahame
is
from
grahame
bent
his
head
in
acknowledgment
and
removed
the
conversation
to
the
scene
of
his
recent
visit
he
enlarged
upon
the
improved
aspect
of
his
estates
and
upon
the
additions
he
intended
to
make
what
accession
of
territory
and
what
increase
of
tenantry
he
had
acquired
and
was
about
to
acquire
he
described
the
torchlight
procession
to
welcome
his
arrival
and
the
vast
assemblage
gathered
to
bid
him
farewell
of
whom
would
have
rejoiced
at
his
downfall
with
savage
joy
all
the
while
he
spoke
there
was
ringing
in
his
brain
the
words
grahame
is
from
as
he
described
the
stately
reception
he
gave
his
tenants
in
the
hall
of
his
scotch
castle
feeling
second
to
no
monarch
in
europe
the
words
grahame
is
from
home
danced
before
his
eyes
not
one
passage
in
his
description
illustrative
of
his
own
elevated
position
came
gradually
from
his
lips
but
he
heard
those
words
as
if
every
one
was
a
note
in
a
grahame
is
from
he
thought
as
he
took
wine
with
his
wife
where
under
what
circumstances
why
should
no
place
no
name
be
mentioned
he
dared
not
ask
he
felt
he
durst
not
he
glanced
furtively
at
all
the
faces
at
table
from
only
could
he
gather
aught
to
satisfy
him
that
there
was
something
unusual
and
unsatisfactory
in
the
disappearance
of
helen
he
said
to
her
abruptly
but
not
austerely
little
wine
evangeline
you
do
not
look
well
she
turned
her
large
clear
eyes
glittering
with
tears
upon
him
he
saw
her
small
upper
lip
quiver
and
he
perceived
that
her
heart
was
too
full
for
her
to
articulate
a
word
as
she
returned
his
salutation
is
something
wrong
something
horrible
has
happened
he
muttered
to
himself
and
he
became
almost
silent
during
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
the
dessert
spread
upon
the
table
and
the
servants
had
retired
he
asked
in
a
seemingly
careless
tone
long
has
helen
been
away
with
whom
is
she
staying
brow
slightly
contracted
she
produced
a
small
beautifully
finished
and
opening
it
took
from
it
her
letter
which
she
handed
to
her
husband
room
was
one
morning
found
by
her
nurse
untenanted
she
said
coldly
letter
was
discovered
upon
her
toilette
such
explanation
as
it
affords
you
have
equally
with
myself
i
know
no
eyes
raced
down
the
trembling
characters
penned
by
his
wretched
child
and
when
he
came
to
the
conclusion
he
looked
up
to
his
wife
in
bewildered
astonishment
does
all
this
mean
he
cried
almost
fiercely
grahame
shrugged
her
shoulders
a
low
sob
burst
from
lips
grahame
he
exclaimed
with
a
strong
scottish
accent
an
evidence
of
unusual
feeling
i
to
understand
that
you
are
unable
to
offer
any
further
explanation
than
this
miserable
epistle
affords
are
grahame
replied
his
wife
with
cold
sullenness
you
make
no
effort
to
trace
her
he
asked
you
no
clue
to
the
place
of
her
flight
have
taken
no
steps
in
the
matter
whatever
extraordinary
conduct
mistress
grahame
he
cried
with
a
brow
of
crimson
very
unsatisfactory
delay
she
glanced
at
him
with
her
dull
gray
eyes
are
the
head
of
the
house
grahame
she
replied
as
such
will
take
the
steps
you
deem
expedient
for
myself
i
as
a
representative
of
a
line
whose
annals
are
unstained
will
never
permit
a
degenerate
child
to
continue
to
move
in
the
same
circle
or
breathe
the
same
air
as
myself
she
has
forgotten
her
position
her
dignity
her
blood
she
has
forfeited
her
claim
to
her
name
and
therefore
with
her
own
hand
has
sundered
the
ties
of
affinity
in
my
eyes
she
is
again
a
low
cry
of
acute
grief
burst
from
evangeline
repeated
grahame
only
a
little
more
emphatically
for
the
interruption
into
the
depths
of
a
grave
from
which
there
is
no
earthly
redemption
grahame
your
and
my
daughter
margaret
claverhouse
is
now
the
eldest
female
representative
of
our
name
in
your
family
and
from
this
moment
it
will
be
so
understood
margaret
we
will
she
rose
as
she
spoke
motioning
to
margaret
to
follow
her
example
as
she
did
so
evangeline
flung
herself
wildly
at
her
feet
mercy
madam
she
cried
is
still
your
child
she
is
my
sister
my
dear
sister
oh
in
mercy
do
not
discard
her
she
is
our
own
flesh
and
blood
you
are
her
mother
oh
in
the
face
of
god
do
not
forget
that
though
she
may
have
erred
she
is
but
human
christ
forgave
and
came
to
save
the
erring
mother
have
mercy
as
you
hope
for
it
at
the
day
of
eternal
judgment
grahame
drew
her
dress
angrily
from
the
clutch
of
evangeline
she
stepped
back
as
the
face
of
her
girl
bowed
itself
upon
her
feet
and
she
said
sternly
raise
this
raving
girl
from
her
unworthy
of
her
name
she
pleads
for
one
who
has
disgraced
herself
and
in
vain
evangeline
retire
to
your
room
and
there
remain
until
you
can
meet
me
in
a
manner
becoming
your
position
as
a
she
turned
to
grahame
and
added
haughtily
but
emphatically
path
you
perceive
grahame
has
been
selected
i
shall
pursue
it
without
swerving
from
it
i
suggest
this
to
you
that
you
may
be
able
to
understand
what
i
deem
the
proper
course
for
you
to
she
swept
haughtily
out
of
the
room
closely
followed
by
her
daughter
margaret
malcolm
lifted
his
sister
evangeline
up
he
whispered
to
her
not
to
make
herself
a
little
fool
about
a
thing
that
could
not
be
helped
and
was
so
far
animated
by
the
common
promptings
of
humanity
as
to
her
to
her
chamber
seeing
that
she
had
hardly
strength
to
get
there
alone
grahame
in
the
meanwhile
with
contracted
brow
and
in
thoughtful
abstraction
made
his
way
to
his
library
he
entered
it
slowly
and
moodily
the
lamp
which
his
servant
had
lighted
had
been
turned
down
the
whole
of
the
further
parts
of
the
room
were
in
deep
shadow
has
disgraced
the
name
of
grahame
he
muttered
between
his
set
teeth
how
how
it
is
a
black
mystery
still
she
has
gone
fled
she
must
be
discarded
disowned
how
could
receive
her
again
has
she
not
disgraced
the
name
of
grahame
and
he
looked
around
him
loftily
and
proudly
he
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
up
on
the
shadowed
cornice
he
saw
written
in
letters
of
lambent
flame
the
frightful
word
forgery
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
still
in
fiery
characters
leaping
coruscating
glittering
he
saw
the
word
he
dared
not
look
into
either
of
the
murky
corners
of
the
apartment
for
in
one
he
expected
to
see
sitting
grinning
and
gibbering
at
him
like
a
fiend
his
arch
accomplice
chewkle
disgraced
the
name
of
grahame
what
then
had
done
in
what
immaculate
position
did
he
stand
that
he
should
close
his
door
upon
his
child
discard
disown
her
upon
a
mere
suspicion
of
error
he
slunk
into
a
chair
he
felt
how
hollow
was
his
pride
how
contemptible
himself
with
an
impatient
and
trembling
hand
he
turned
up
the
lamp
until
the
room
was
one
glare
of
light
he
rang
his
bell
violently
the
summons
was
answered
by
whelks
me
said
grahame
resuming
his
cold
austere
manner
any
person
been
here
desiring
to
see
me
privately
during
my
absence
he
alluded
to
chewkle
he
fully
expected
to
be
told
that
he
had
called
three
or
four
times
he
was
therefore
surprised
to
hear
answer
him
negatively
you
sure
he
said
pointedly
am
sure
no
person
been
of
that
deskripshun
sir
the
man
replied
stay
there
was
one
yes
there
was
one
was
that
inquired
grahame
sharply
was
the
small
little
dwarf
who
the
janders
offul
sir
gummy
sir
responded
whelks
gomer
corrected
grahame
thoughtfully
presently
he
said
that
individual
that
person
named
chewkle
not
call
in
my
absence
sir
returned
whelks
who
had
traced
to
the
best
of
his
belief
his
missing
sovring
to
him
gummy
asked
me
if
he
had
called
lately
which
i
told
him
no
and
he
asked
me
if
i
know
where
i
could
find
him
which
i
tell
him
i
not
a
whelks
would
have
availed
himself
of
it
rather
promptly
if
he
had
this
absence
of
chewkle
in
connection
with
the
loss
of
the
document
with
forged
signature
was
both
mysterious
and
disturbingly
perplexing
the
painful
doubts
it
gave
birth
to
in
his
mind
were
not
relieved
by
the
information
that
nathan
gomer
had
been
making
inquiries
respecting
him
he
saw
however
that
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
appear
to
seek
chewkle
he
was
likely
to
prove
sufficiently
a
locust
without
his
taking
such
a
step
he
therefore
determined
to
await
his
appearance
seeming
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
his
mind
he
turned
over
a
few
letters
which
lay
upon
his
table
and
said
in
a
deliberate
but
apparently
apathetic
tone
miss
maid
to
a
miss
sir
said
whelks
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
a
stalker
sir
returned
grahame
with
a
frown
maid
chayter
that
is
her
name
i
oh
yaas
yaas
sir
she
gone
yaas
sir
you
know
where
she
is
to
be
found
think
i
a
impression
it
is
at
least
her
come
out
at
her
and
bring
her
to
me
instantly
quietly
you
whelks
bowed
and
retired
he
guessed
his
object
and
very
quickly
unkennelled
chayter
who
likewise
suspected
the
reason
why
grahame
sent
for
her
and
prepared
herself
accordingly
within
a
short
time
from
receiving
his
instructions
whelks
introduced
chayter
into
the
library
and
stationed
himself
outside
the
door
with
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
to
put
himself
in
possession
of
what
transpired
at
the
interview
but
a
current
of
air
so
sharp
and
so
steady
poured
through
the
small
opening
into
his
ear
that
he
was
compelled
to
retire
to
avoid
another
onslaught
of
his
quick
eye
detected
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
with
grahame
a
little
pile
of
sovereigns
some
eight
or
ten
upon
the
table
grahame
pointed
to
them
shall
be
yours
he
said
you
afford
me
any
satisfactory
information
respecting
the
disappearance
of
miss
can
only
tell
you
what
i
know
sir
replied
the
girl
regarding
the
sovereigns
with
a
wishful
eye
what
you
may
have
reason
to
assume
he
added
he
then
put
a
variety
of
questions
to
her
some
of
which
she
answered
truthfully
and
others
by
mere
invention
it
was
not
much
that
he
ascertained
yet
enough
to
know
that
helen
was
in
the
habit
of
meeting
some
person
at
night
in
the
garden
that
whoever
he
was
he
frequently
addressed
letters
to
her
and
was
no
doubt
the
person
who
being
discovered
suddenly
by
the
honorable
lester
vane
had
felled
that
gentleman
to
the
earth
grahame
racked
his
brain
to
no
purpose
to
fix
upon
some
one
likely
to
be
the
man
who
had
so
singularly
beguiled
his
daughter
from
her
high
place
and
at
length
he
handed
the
money
to
chayter
and
bade
her
if
she
could
obtain
any
further
information
upon
the
strange
subject
to
communicate
it
to
him
and
she
should
be
liberally
rewarded
find
her
out
said
chayter
when
she
left
will
be
worth
my
while
be
clever
if
she
keeps
herself
hidden
from
me
chayter
was
premature
in
her
conclusions
grahame
sat
alone
to
reflect
upon
his
situation
a
cloud
had
once
more
risen
upon
his
fair
sky
and
threatened
a
storm
the
flight
and
possible
of
his
daughter
helen
would
certainly
become
known
and
prove
humbling
to
the
pride
of
his
house
the
arrangements
between
himself
and
wilton
had
yet
to
be
completed
he
had
received
large
sums
of
money
for
which
he
had
given
acknowledgments
and
should
anything
arise
to
destroy
the
present
understanding
his
position
would
be
frightful
utter
ruin
and
beggary
must
at
one
blow
ensue
but
there
was
no
reason
to
presume
that
the
proposition
made
by
nathan
gomer
and
acceded
to
by
wilton
would
not
be
completed
there
was
a
possibility
of
his
son
malcolm
marrying
flora
wilton
still
there
was
the
possible
contingency
of
something
arising
to
prevent
either
being
accomplished
ah
if
old
wilton
had
but
perished
in
the
fire
which
had
consumed
his
house
or
had
died
in
prison
the
whole
of
the
wealth
in
dispute
would
have
come
to
him
grahame
if
the
old
man
were
to
die
now
before
the
arrangement
was
completed
the
same
result
would
take
place
for
the
existence
of
mark
wilton
was
a
problem
so
far
as
knowledge
of
him
went
if
he
were
to
die
now
safety
wealth
and
a
future
secure
from
the
fears
that
now
tortured
him
would
be
the
consequence
to
him
if
he
were
to
die
now
heart
throbbed
and
he
felt
cold
as
ice
he
threw
his
eyes
stealthily
round
the
library
he
was
alone
the
man
was
old
how
small
a
thing
might
rob
him
of
life
a
common
accident
a
potion
administered
in
mistake
a
subtle
poison
in
fruit
grahame
rose
from
his
chair
could
he
have
seen
the
aspect
of
his
own
features
at
this
moment
in
the
glass
he
would
have
almost
screamed
with
horror
he
tottered
rather
than
walked
to
a
and
ran
his
eye
down
the
back
of
his
books
presently
he
clutched
at
one
drew
it
out
and
moved
back
with
it
to
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
lamp
the
book
was
labelled
with
a
hand
which
shook
as
if
it
was
smitten
with
the
palsy
he
turned
over
a
few
of
the
leaves
and
began
reading
with
some
avidity
an
article
on
tieuté
deeply
interested
in
the
revelations
he
became
unconscious
of
all
else
until
the
pressure
of
a
heavy
hand
upon
his
shoulder
caused
him
to
start
with
fright
and
to
spring
back
several
feet
just
where
he
had
been
standing
he
beheld
a
grim
man
whose
clothes
where
shabby
greasy
and
dusty
whose
face
was
pale
and
whose
eyes
were
red
whose
matted
hair
was
straggling
over
his
forehead
and
whose
thick
stubbly
beard
rendered
his
grimy
visage
yet
more
foul
in
its
aspect
grahame
stretched
his
hand
towards
the
bell
a
sudden
motion
on
the
part
of
the
stranger
arrested
his
attention
and
then
he
saw
for
the
first
time
that
his
visitor
was
no
other
than
chewkle
he
gazed
upon
him
with
an
emotion
which
partook
of
offended
pride
uneasy
wonder
and
a
lurking
darkly
foreboding
fear
chewkle
now
present
was
not
at
least
in
appearance
the
chewkle
first
introduced
to
our
readers
then
he
was
the
commission
agent
now
he
was
the
dirty
ruffian
the
change
was
so
remarkable
as
to
extort
an
immediate
remark
from
grahame
who
with
knitted
brows
demanded
of
him
how
he
came
to
visit
him
in
such
filthy
guise
mind
about
that
returned
chewkle
evincing
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
his
intention
to
dispense
with
ceremony
and
with
deferential
respect
come
here
on
a
holiday
visit
i
can
tell
you
i
came
about
that
forger
hush
man
are
you
mad
that
you
speak
so
loud
interrupted
grahame
excitedly
mad
and
no
mistake
cried
chewkle
drawing
the
dirty
cuff
of
his
coat
across
his
parched
and
blackened
lips
been
hunted
like
a
dog
by
the
hofiicers
but
i
been
run
down
yet
and
i
be
if
you
does
the
thing
rights
and
you
must
or
by
threats
man
again
interposed
grahame
attempting
to
assume
a
firm
and
haughty
manner
me
how
it
is
you
appear
before
me
in
this
disreputable
condition
and
for
what
you
wish
in
thus
forcing
upon
me
an
interview
at
so
unseasonable
an
hour
chewkle
glared
at
him
with
red
eyes
he
perused
the
features
of
grahame
as
though
to
read
in
their
expression
the
line
of
conduct
he
intended
to
adopt
with
him
here
he
said
his
beetling
brows
descending
low
enough
to
hide
the
upper
lids
of
his
glittering
eyes
be
no
mistake
between
us
that
dockyment
document
forgotten
it
so
soon
that
dockyment
bearing
old
name
which
you
forged
in
my
presence
that
dockyment
which
you
think
to
be
lost
but
which
because
i
knows
where
it
is
and
can
have
it
brought
forard
at
a
notice
that
dockyment
which
you
would
swear
i
dessay
that
never
seen
before
only
you
forget
that
you
made
a
davy
when
it
went
to
be
registered
that
the
signature
was
genuine
and
was
done
in
your
presence
and
in
that
dockyment
which
a
few
years
ago
would
hanged
you
at
newgate
and
which
now
if
i
likes
mind
if
will
drag
you
before
a
judge
and
jury
and
turn
you
mighty
proud
as
you
are
into
a
wretch
silence
or
strangle
you
cried
grahame
springing
upon
him
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
fright
volubility
urged
by
his
irritation
having
resisted
all
extravagant
signs
and
motions
to
check
it
he
struck
down
hands
and
said
you
and
mark
me
take
my
advice
and
be
quiet
or
make
your
own
too
to
you
do
you
want
with
me
growled
grahame
in
anxious
fear
seeing
that
it
would
be
useless
to
expostulate
with
or
threaten
such
a
determined
ruffian
he
formed
a
hasty
resolve
to
give
him
the
money
or
some
portion
off
it
that
he
expected
he
would
require
and
get
rid
of
him
wants
this
of
you
money
expected
as
but
not
without
earning
it
got
something
to
tell
as
will
startle
you
listen
and
see
whether
it
be
worth
while
to
open
your
purse
to
me
old
wilton
wants
one
link
of
evidence
to
make
him
master
of
all
that
property
you
have
been
trying
to
get
he
replied
grahame
with
a
of
what
was
to
follow
that
link
i
know
where
to
clap
my
hand
on
it
and
bring
it
to
light
or
if
liberally
renoomerated
to
keep
it
this
truth
cried
grahame
petrified
chewkle
immediately
took
a
terrific
oath
to
confirm
its
assertion
a
man
he
added
his
name
is
josh
maybee
eh
same
the
same
where
is
he
jest
what
i
shall
keep
for
the
present
to
myself
i
mind
telling
you
that
he
does
not
know
his
own
vally
and
that
i
does
and
i
means
to
make
a
trifle
by
him
either
out
of
you
or
wilton
for
if
you
think
it
worth
while
to
pay
to
keep
the
man
dark
wilton
will
i
daresay
think
very
little
of
a
hundred
or
two
to
have
him
turn
intelligence
is
indeed
important
murmured
grahame
with
colourless
features
swear
that
he
is
living
and
can
easily
be
produced
confess
if
you
are
able
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
you
are
entitled
to
a
handsome
sum
from
thought
hear
when
when
you
say
that
you
that
you
will
keep
the
man
those
were
yonr
words
i
think
chewkle
nodded
feel
i
precisely
understand
yonr
meaning
am
i
to
be
assured
that
you
will
will
so
arrange
matters
that
this
man
this
maybee
can
appear
again
either
to
disturb
my
peace
or
or
to
substantiate
claim
to
the
estate
grahame
looked
into
eyes
with
a
strange
meaning
chewkle
read
the
expression
correctly
instantly
and
he
instinctively
shuddered
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
then
he
whispered
is
it
grahame
threw
his
eyes
slowly
round
the
library
and
then
fastened
them
again
on
inflamed
orbs
would
be
the
source
of
unceasing
torture
to
me
to
know
the
evidence
of
which
you
speak
to
be
living
and
that
at
any
moment
it
might
be
true
muttered
chewkle
would
be
to
my
interest
to
pay
handsomely
very
handsomely
if
i
knew
the
evidence
chewkle
my
good
wants
werry
much
at
this
moment
my
position
is
this
i
was
secretary
and
treasurer
to
a
benefit
society
and
a
little
while
ago
they
wanted
money
in
a
hurry
and
i
let
their
funds
i
you
speaks
plain
but
not
correctly
i
had
and
it
was
inconvenient
to
return
jest
when
they
wanted
they
was
rash
and
listen
to
explanations
and
set
the
police
on
me
i
have
been
hiding
and
seeking
and
starving
ever
since
but
i
can
square
it
by
paying
the
sum
they
lent
you
lent
yourself
what
is
its
amount
forty
want
that
sum
now
josh
maybee
must
turn
up
in
favour
the
bobbies
are
too
close
upon
my
heels
to
waste
any
time
in
parleying
about
grahame
drew
forth
his
and
from
it
selected
a
fifty
pound
note
he
opened
it
to
the
greedy
eyes
of
chewkle
but
he
retained
it
while
he
spoke
will
give
you
this
note
now
he
said
slowly
and
in
a
marked
manner
relieve
you
from
your
present
difficulties
but
i
will
give
you
twice
ten
times
that
amount
when
i
know
that
the
evidence
we
have
spoken
of
can
not
at
any
time
mind
at
any
time
be
me
the
note
said
chewkle
shall
be
made
easy
in
a
few
days
and
i
shall
be
as
as
jolly
as
a
sandboy
grahame
gave
him
the
note
he
took
it
and
after
carefully
reading
it
put
it
away
into
his
pocket
them
will
be
worth
fingering
he
said
with
a
grin
and
added
abruptly
perhaps
if
old
wilton
was
to
die
suddenly
it
might
be
something
in
my
a
sickly
smile
passed
over
face
is
no
telling
what
happens
to
old
men
he
replied
have
no
desire
to
harm
the
old
fellow
but
i
would
give
a
magnificent
douceur
to
the
man
who
brought
me
tidings
that
he
had
been
gathered
to
his
then
he
added
quickly
away
i
expect
some
of
my
family
here
can
not
you
contrive
to
slip
out
unobserved
responded
chewkle
with
a
knowing
look
came
in
by
the
garding
and
up
the
hanging
staircase
luckily
the
winder
was
half
open
though
the
blind
was
down
i
shall
go
back
the
same
grahame
now
understood
the
secret
of
his
sudden
and
noiseless
appearance
he
was
not
sorry
to
know
that
the
man
could
retire
from
the
house
without
being
seen
but
he
resolved
that
a
like
opportunity
to
enter
at
unbidden
moments
should
not
be
afforded
him
he
watched
him
descend
into
the
garden
listened
to
his
stealthy
tread
upon
the
smooth
gravel
path
and
remained
motionless
until
his
intent
ear
could
detect
no
other
sound
than
the
rustle
of
leaves
stirred
by
the
soft
breath
of
a
gentle
night
breeze
then
he
returned
to
his
table
he
took
up
the
work
he
had
hastily
thrown
it
from
him
when
startled
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
chewkle
he
gazed
with
a
aspect
at
the
book
opened
it
closed
it
with
a
smart
clap
and
then
walking
with
a
firm
step
to
his
bookcase
he
replaced
it
shall
not
now
need
its
aid
he
muttered
then
he
sat
himself
by
his
library
table
after
musing
a
moment
or
two
he
jerked
his
head
once
or
twice
and
ejaculated
a
scoundrel
that
fellow
chewkle
is
then
he
calmly
applied
himself
to
the
perusal
of
some
letters
chapter
the
coveted
heart
bestowed
she
saw
it
waxing
very
pale
and
dead
and
straight
all
so
lisped
tenderly
here
she
ceased
her
timid
quest
but
in
her
tone
and
look
he
read
the
rest
oh
isabella
i
can
half
perceive
that
i
might
speak
my
grief
into
thine
ear
if
thou
ever
anything
believe
believe
how
i
love
thee
believe
how
near
my
soul
is
to
its
doom
i
would
not
grieve
thy
hand
by
unwelcome
pressing
would
not
fear
thine
eyes
by
gazing
but
i
can
not
live
another
night
and
not
my
passion
shrive
keats
as
soon
as
lawyers
had
executed
and
completed
all
the
preliminaries
necessary
to
reinstate
him
in
the
possession
of
that
property
from
which
some
years
back
he
had
been
so
unceremoniously
expelled
and
had
transferred
the
accumulated
arrears
from
the
court
of
chancery
to
his
bankers
the
old
man
set
out
with
flora
suddenly
and
alone
once
more
to
tread
those
halls
where
before
he
had
reigned
supreme
as
lord
and
master
wilton
had
a
motive
in
proceeding
to
his
long
lost
home
thus
privately
his
heart
was
susceptible
of
emotion
a
long
course
of
comparative
poverty
had
tended
greatly
to
weaken
his
nervous
system
and
when
last
he
left
the
spot
he
was
now
about
to
visit
a
young
trembling
wife
whom
he
had
loved
passionately
and
tenderly
and
with
a
devotion
which
had
never
changed
under
the
afflicting
trials
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
clung
weeping
to
his
arm
long
waving
grass
swayed
softly
to
and
fro
now
above
where
she
lay
in
her
last
sleep
he
knew
that
those
tearful
eyes
which
had
looked
up
at
the
picturesque
old
building
had
dwelt
upon
the
valley
and
the
the
clustering
woods
and
the
distant
villages
with
lingering
agonized
gaze
could
never
more
regard
them
never
more
bend
their
earnest
beaming
glad
looks
of
recognition
upon
the
places
where
in
early
and
in
happy
times
they
had
so
loved
to
rest
he
knew
he
should
have
a
sharp
wrestle
with
his
spirit
when
he
placed
again
his
footstep
upon
the
threshold
of
his
recovered
mansion
and
he
wished
no
eye
save
that
of
heaven
or
of
his
child
to
irreverently
obtrude
upon
his
sacred
emotions
this
will
explain
why
he
so
suddenly
departed
from
london
without
communicating
to
anyone
his
intention
and
why
flora
submitted
to
his
request
not
to
mention
his
purpose
even
to
one
person
it
was
night
when
they
reached
their
destination
in
a
carriage
which
bore
them
from
the
railway
station
to
their
new
home
and
by
the
strict
injunctions
of
wilton
the
housekeeper
and
one
servant
only
were
at
the
entrance
of
harleydale
hall
to
receive
them
wilton
with
an
agitated
manner
drew
arm
within
his
own
and
entered
the
spacious
hall
he
threw
his
eyes
hurriedly
round
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
everything
appeared
to
be
much
in
the
same
state
as
when
he
had
quitted
it
the
housekeeper
an
elderly
matron
advanced
and
in
trembling
voice
said
welcome
sir
home
welcome
to
your
own
god
be
praised
you
have
won
your
rights
you
thank
you
steadfast
he
replied
huskily
am
glad
to
see
you
are
still
here
sir
thank
heaven
and
madam
your
dear
lady
i
am
so
proud
daughter
my
daughter
mrs
steadfast
a
mere
child
when
last
you
saw
flora
put
aside
her
veil
that
the
old
servant
who
had
many
a
time
held
her
in
her
arms
should
see
her
face
and
the
changes
that
time
had
made
in
it
the
housekeeper
uttered
an
exclamation
and
muttered
very
counterpart
then
she
turned
to
old
wilton
and
said
your
dear
lady
my
loved
and
honoured
young
mistress
sir
for
young
she
was
when
last
i
saw
wilton
removed
his
hat
and
gazing
upwards
said
in
a
low
impressive
tone
yet
tremulous
with
intense
feeling
is
in
heaven
there
was
a
solemn
stillness
for
an
instant
the
housekeeper
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
flora
gently
stole
her
hand
into
her
and
pressed
it
then
the
old
man
with
a
burst
of
anguish
hurried
up
the
staircase
and
parting
in
broken
sentences
with
his
daughter
for
the
night
sought
the
retirement
of
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
there
battled
with
his
sorrow
alone
flora
too
passed
a
part
of
the
night
in
tears
and
prayer
tears
for
the
loss
of
the
gentle
being
she
had
loved
so
affectionately
and
prayer
for
an
with
her
hereafter
in
the
regions
of
paradise
somehow
the
form
of
hal
vivian
was
interwoven
with
her
thoughts
and
her
prayers
she
wept
as
her
vision
brought
him
to
her
eyes
she
knew
not
wherefore
and
her
cheek
hushed
and
burned
as
in
fancy
she
saw
his
quiet
earnest
gaze
bent
upon
her
face
the
sun
was
penetrating
brightly
through
the
window
of
her
sleeping
chamber
as
she
awoke
she
pressed
her
beautiful
eyes
with
the
delicate
tips
of
her
soft
fingers
and
then
opening
them
gazed
around
her
surprised
and
somewhat
disappointed
to
find
that
she
was
no
longer
dreaming
as
with
the
assistance
of
her
maid
she
attired
herself
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
upon
the
lovely
landscape
spread
before
her
upland
and
woodland
valley
and
ridge
all
clothed
in
luxuriant
verdure
fair
as
eye
ever
rested
upon
and
her
dreams
were
called
up
by
the
beautiful
scene
before
her
a
rosy
blush
mantled
on
her
cheek
as
she
remembered
that
hal
took
part
in
her
dreams
and
probably
she
thought
that
as
with
joy
she
had
wandered
with
him
in
flowery
meads
and
shadowy
groves
in
her
dream
the
reality
if
it
were
to
occur
here
would
not
be
altogether
distasteful
to
her
again
her
cheek
burned
and
her
gentle
bosom
heaved
as
in
her
mental
dreams
she
saw
his
full
clear
eye
turned
upon
her
with
thoughtful
fervour
strange
that
she
should
not
ask
herself
what
this
emotion
meant
for
the
first
few
days
she
wandered
with
her
father
or
alone
over
the
more
attractive
portions
of
the
property
memory
was
busy
all
the
while
and
she
sought
to
retrace
spots
and
places
she
had
in
laughing
childhood
gambolled
over
at
the
expiration
of
a
week
colonel
mires
made
his
appearance
there
was
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
his
features
his
skin
was
of
a
white
sallowness
his
eye
was
brighter
and
the
edges
of
the
eyelids
were
red
as
if
inflamed
his
black
hair
seemed
longer
and
to
be
straggling
as
if
the
care
originally
displayed
in
its
arrangement
had
been
abandoned
his
voice
too
was
hoarser
in
its
tone
and
his
manner
appeared
agitated
and
abrupt
wilton
did
not
notice
the
alteration
in
him
but
flora
observed
it
and
attributed
it
to
some
event
that
had
happened
and
had
brought
him
sorrow
so
she
was
more
kind
in
her
manner
to
him
and
seemed
to
evince
more
interest
in
his
conversation
than
she
had
ever
before
exhibited
there
was
no
disguise
in
the
joy
which
he
displayed
at
this
but
she
saw
in
it
nothing
more
than
gratefulness
for
her
endeavour
to
wile
away
moments
he
would
otherwise
have
spent
in
sad
thoughts
his
flushed
cheek
and
his
increased
excitement
were
not
interpreted
as
he
could
have
wished
for
that
he
entertained
for
her
the
passion
of
love
was
exactly
the
last
thing
she
would
have
conceived
respecting
him
he
sought
by
all
the
experience
he
was
master
of
to
increase
and
improve
the
opportunity
afforded
him
in
having
the
field
to
himself
of
ingratiating
himself
in
her
good
graces
and
of
winning
her
favour
but
anxious
as
he
was
upon
the
point
he
was
afraid
to
declare
himself
for
fear
of
startling
her
timid
nature
all
unpractised
in
the
ways
and
thus
damage
the
cause
he
had
at
heart
a
cause
which
he
trusted
to
conduct
to
success
by
obtaining
an
influence
over
her
the
insidious
approaches
of
which
should
be
so
cautiously
concealed
that
she
would
be
unable
to
detect
them
until
she
discovered
herself
in
trammels
from
which
she
would
be
unable
to
get
free
it
is
easy
to
lay
plans
for
the
capture
of
a
heart
artless
innocent
gentle
yielding
she
may
be
but
even
when
those
plans
matured
by
all
that
practised
skill
and
experience
can
suggest
are
put
in
operation
it
is
often
found
at
the
moment
of
anticipated
triumph
that
the
surrender
of
the
heart
depends
solely
on
some
condition
which
was
omitted
in
the
calculations
upon
which
the
plans
were
constructed
women
have
strong
instincts
as
well
as
large
intuitive
perceptions
not
reducible
to
any
known
laws
of
reasoning
they
dislike
a
certain
man
because
they
do
and
suspect
him
from
no
more
explainable
cause
now
this
man
may
be
well
versed
in
the
weaknesses
of
the
fairer
sex
and
well
acquainted
with
all
the
points
upon
which
they
are
most
susceptible
and
accessible
but
if
he
has
excited
dislike
and
suspicion
however
fair
and
clear
his
conduct
may
have
been
he
may
just
as
well
lay
plans
to
capture
the
moon
in
the
expectation
of
being
successful
as
to
lay
siege
to
the
heart
of
a
woman
who
dislikes
or
suspects
him
in
anticipation
of
winning
it
the
advantage
colonel
mires
possessed
in
being
the
sole
guest
of
wilton
he
continued
for
some
little
time
to
enjoy
and
he
observed
with
no
small
gratification
that
flora
sat
and
listened
with
quiet
attention
and
evident
interest
to
his
strange
and
wild
stories
of
indian
life
romantic
adventures
in
campaigns
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
he
narrated
with
graphic
power
artfully
making
himself
the
hero
of
the
events
without
seeming
intentionally
to
do
it
occasionally
and
with
consummate
skill
he
would
interweave
with
his
relations
love
stories
mostly
to
show
how
a
man
like
himself
had
daring
the
stormy
period
of
his
life
raised
up
an
ideal
beauty
to
love
and
worship
how
on
the
long
weary
march
in
the
quiet
night
in
his
tent
pitched
upon
the
cold
damp
earth
or
in
the
fierce
din
of
warlike
strife
he
had
looked
upon
that
face
as
a
lodestar
cheering
him
on
his
march
shining
upon
him
in
the
silent
night
and
leading
him
on
to
glory
in
the
roar
of
battle
how
in
after
times
the
reality
had
presented
itself
to
his
longing
eyes
and
how
he
had
wooed
the
gentle
creature
and
brought
her
to
love
him
for
dangers
he
had
how
she
believing
his
ardent
vow
that
his
whole
future
life
should
be
devoted
to
the
consummation
of
her
future
happiness
had
given
to
him
her
hand
with
her
heart
in
it
flora
listened
to
such
stories
with
downcast
eyes
and
thoughtful
air
it
was
evident
they
made
an
impression
upon
her
it
seemed
even
that
she
loved
to
listen
to
them
it
was
plain
that
she
did
not
grow
weary
of
them
for
she
never
displayed
inattention
or
a
desire
to
be
away
while
he
was
deep
in
such
a
narration
but
whether
she
interpreted
them
as
he
wished
her
to
do
he
was
unable
to
detect
yet
she
was
given
much
to
wander
alone
she
contrived
to
elude
the
endeavours
made
by
the
colonel
to
accompany
her
soon
after
dawn
she
would
be
away
in
the
woods
or
in
the
glen
upon
the
or
by
the
fair
brook
that
meandered
like
a
silver
thread
through
the
valley
or
she
would
slip
away
when
she
perceived
that
her
father
had
engaged
his
guest
in
conversation
of
a
character
not
likely
to
terminate
for
some
little
time
many
a
sequestered
spot
shaded
by
the
soft
green
leaves
of
graceful
trees
she
found
in
her
rambles
and
secure
from
interruption
enjoyed
its
solitary
retirement
and
its
quiet
beauties
but
always
alone
she
shared
the
pleasure
she
obtained
in
visiting
these
leafy
recesses
with
no
one
it
may
have
been
that
here
she
was
free
to
think
without
the
possibility
of
the
emotions
playing
over
her
expressive
features
being
seen
and
interpreted
without
too
the
full
play
of
her
thoughts
being
impeded
she
would
sit
for
hours
in
dreamy
abstraction
sometimes
she
would
weep
unbidden
tears
weep
she
could
not
tell
why
would
feel
depressed
lonely
sad
without
attempting
to
assign
a
cause
often
would
her
cheek
flush
and
her
bosom
heave
while
deep
sighs
burst
from
her
breast
and
she
would
look
distastefully
round
her
rise
and
with
impatient
manner
wander
to
some
other
spot
only
to
repeat
her
emotions
and
then
return
home
perhaps
to
seek
her
chamber
and
there
relieve
her
surcharged
heart
by
weeping
suffering
this
strange
she
knew
not
wherefore
one
day
it
was
announced
to
the
discomfiture
of
colonel
mires
that
the
honorable
lester
vane
had
arrived
and
craved
the
honour
of
paying
his
respects
to
wilton
and
his
daughter
the
old
man
exhibited
considerable
pleasure
at
this
arrival
and
warmly
welcomed
his
new
guest
reception
of
him
under
the
strong
injunctions
of
her
father
had
rather
too
much
display
to
please
the
colonel
who
could
not
help
looking
upon
vane
with
jealous
misgivings
he
met
him
with
a
cold
and
haughty
reserve
which
vane
perceived
and
returned
with
interest
at
first
lester
vane
declared
that
he
had
arrived
with
the
purpose
only
of
paying
a
flying
visit
but
he
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
wilton
into
making
a
longer
stay
and
he
very
quickly
gave
colonel
mires
an
opportunity
of
discovering
that
he
was
passionately
smitten
by
charms
and
that
he
intended
to
win
her
if
he
could
colonel
mires
grew
deadly
sick
at
heart
as
the
conviction
without
the
consolation
of
one
poor
doubt
forced
itself
upon
him
the
honorable
lester
vane
was
a
formidable
rival
he
was
many
years
his
junior
he
was
tall
and
possessed
a
handsome
face
he
was
the
son
of
a
nobleman
and
some
day
would
be
himself
a
lord
he
could
thus
not
only
present
a
hand
some
person
to
the
consideration
of
a
young
girl
who
had
been
for
many
years
placed
in
a
humble
sphere
but
could
offer
to
her
the
prospect
of
becoming
a
titled
lady
an
inducement
almost
always
of
weight
in
feminine
consideration
the
colonel
therefore
found
that
he
had
much
very
much
to
do
to
even
maintain
the
ground
he
fancied
he
had
gained
and
very
much
more
to
oust
a
rival
who
had
as
he
believed
every
advantage
in
his
favour
and
superior
claims
to
his
own
in
the
struggle
for
hand
lester
vane
had
conceived
a
passionate
attachment
for
the
person
of
flora
a
burning
feverish
attachment
with
which
pure
love
had
little
to
do
her
beauty
had
taken
his
soul
by
storm
and
absence
from
her
had
inflamed
his
imagination
to
an
intensity
he
found
it
impossible
to
endure
hence
in
spite
of
certain
other
designs
he
had
formed
and
was
determined
upon
accomplishing
he
had
felt
himself
compelled
on
finding
wilton
had
left
london
to
follow
him
down
to
the
country
he
detected
the
position
of
colonel
mires
in
an
instant
is
a
friend
of
the
family
he
said
to
himself
with
a
sneer
is
smitten
with
miss
beauty
and
he
expects
to
cunningly
worm
himself
into
her
good
graces
and
so
make
her
his
wife
bah
she
would
never
willingly
sacrifice
herself
to
him
no
no
i
like
the
fellow
i
like
the
expression
of
his
eyes
they
have
a
dangerous
character
i
can
cope
with
him
i
think
but
if
i
fail
by
art
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
goad
him
by
insult
into
a
challenge
fourteen
paces
and
a
firm
hand
will
settle
the
matter
between
us
for
so
flora
immediately
after
the
advent
of
lester
vane
found
her
society
courted
both
by
him
and
colonel
mires
with
a
solicitude
and
an
earnestness
which
quickly
became
embarrassing
to
her
her
father
passed
a
great
deal
of
his
time
alone
in
his
library
his
restoration
to
the
society
of
his
books
was
one
of
the
happiest
conditions
in
his
change
from
poverty
to
wealth
he
hardly
knew
how
enough
to
indulge
in
those
treasures
of
art
and
science
thus
repossessed
and
which
had
been
his
passion
in
former
times
flora
was
thus
left
to
the
it
might
almost
be
said
importunities
of
her
guests
for
though
both
as
men
did
not
exceed
the
strict
rules
of
good
society
yet
they
took
every
occasion
to
make
her
see
and
to
understand
that
their
attentions
were
dictated
by
something
warmer
than
the
impulses
of
common
friendship
she
had
one
protection
in
the
fact
that
the
rivalry
existing
between
these
lovers
made
each
take
every
precaution
that
the
other
should
not
have
the
satisfaction
and
the
advantage
of
a
with
the
object
of
their
mutual
passion
and
this
was
even
extended
to
her
excursions
lester
vane
at
times
watched
and
followed
her
but
he
had
scarcely
reached
her
side
when
they
were
joined
by
mires
who
would
on
no
suggestion
or
hint
from
vane
quit
the
pair
until
the
house
was
reached
and
flora
had
retired
to
her
own
apartment
this
occurred
several
times
flora
began
to
feel
distressed
and
alarmed
not
any
direct
profession
of
love
had
fallen
from
the
lips
of
either
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
not
to
comprehend
by
the
devoted
attentions
the
fervent
language
and
the
ardent
looks
addressed
to
her
by
each
that
these
professions
would
be
made
and
at
no
distant
period
thus
she
began
to
contract
the
duration
of
her
stay
in
the
presence
of
her
guests
and
to
so
contrive
her
rambles
that
they
should
take
place
at
periods
when
she
was
likely
to
be
secure
from
interruption
she
grew
pale
and
melancholy
was
often
abstracted
while
in
the
company
of
those
who
sought
exclusively
to
occupy
her
attention
and
without
being
marked
in
her
increasing
desire
for
seclusion
she
presented
herself
in
the
or
only
when
she
could
not
well
escape
the
duties
of
her
position
it
was
not
difficult
for
either
colonel
mires
or
lester
vane
to
see
that
flora
looked
upon
the
seemingly
accidental
rencontres
with
themselves
in
their
strolls
as
unfortunate
and
that
she
viewed
them
with
distaste
colonel
mires
even
took
the
trouble
to
sound
her
on
the
subject
and
succeeded
in
eliciting
from
her
that
she
preferred
in
her
morning
walks
to
be
quite
alone
lester
vane
caught
at
her
acknowledgment
and
proposed
a
shooting
excursion
for
the
following
morning
to
colonel
mires
who
promptly
acceded
to
the
proposition
flora
perceived
that
this
was
a
delicate
attention
to
her
wish
and
responded
by
a
grateful
look
to
vane
who
treasured
it
up
to
be
that
night
gloated
over
as
a
step
gained
towards
the
goal
he
looked
forward
to
reach
see
my
way
better
from
that
glance
he
thought
i
have
yet
by
any
occurrence
that
has
happened
i
will
rack
my
brain
to
lay
her
under
small
obligations
those
little
thankfulnesses
gathered
together
will
reach
to
the
magnitude
of
fondness
and
if
i
but
make
her
fond
if
i
can
only
make
her
fond
the
victory
is
that
morning
early
lester
vane
and
colonel
mires
equipped
for
the
sport
attended
by
the
gamekeeper
and
their
grooms
set
out
upon
their
expedition
flora
seeing
her
father
safe
in
his
library
surrounded
by
his
favourite
authors
and
bent
upon
scientific
experiments
which
were
likely
to
absorb
his
devoted
attention
until
took
a
book
with
her
and
sauntered
away
from
the
house
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
which
she
had
seen
the
gentlemen
take
she
directed
her
steps
towards
a
sequestered
glen
through
which
the
valley
stream
flowed
chanting
its
bubbling
lay
and
where
wild
flowers
were
profuse
young
trees
thickly
intertwined
shaded
the
sun
from
the
soft
even
emerald
sward
and
the
silence
was
only
disturbed
by
the
singing
of
birds
striving
to
rival
the
musical
murmur
of
the
rippling
water
as
it
swept
windingly
through
the
secluded
place
of
late
she
had
visited
this
spot
more
frequently
than
any
other
for
in
her
approach
to
it
she
had
not
been
encountered
by
either
the
colonel
or
vane
nor
did
she
ever
within
its
precincts
see
living
creatures
save
the
birds
darting
from
the
sunlight
into
the
shadowy
trees
or
the
fish
leaping
out
of
the
stream
in
pursuit
of
their
prey
she
was
therefore
not
a
little
disturbed
and
surprised
on
making
her
way
to
her
accustomed
seat
to
find
it
occupied
by
a
gentleman
who
with
his
head
resting
upon
his
hand
was
seated
gazing
upon
the
stream
in
an
attitude
of
abstracted
contemplation
she
would
have
retreated
if
possible
without
attracting
the
observation
of
the
stranger
but
the
glitter
of
her
flowing
garments
had
attracted
his
eyes
and
he
turned
towards
her
rising
up
as
he
did
so
a
faint
exclamation
burst
from
her
lips
as
the
stranger
advanced
in
her
direction
with
something
of
a
hesitating
manner
but
she
eagerly
held
out
both
her
hands
to
greet
him
her
eyes
glittered
like
diamonds
and
a
rosy
flush
suddenly
spread
itself
over
neck
face
and
forehead
vivian
she
exclaimed
strange
we
should
meet
here
you
have
come
down
to
pay
us
a
visit
have
you
not
heaven
how
pale
you
look
are
you
ill
it
was
hal
vivian
certainly
and
with
a
face
pale
anxious
and
marked
with
lines
of
sorrow
he
took
her
extended
hands
he
saw
how
her
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
at
meeting
him
it
was
an
expression
scarcely
to
be
misunderstood
or
observed
by
him
at
least
with
apathy
he
saw
too
the
crimson
flush
upon
her
cheek
and
perhaps
his
own
became
of
as
deep
a
hue
strange
that
we
have
met
here
miss
wilton
he
replied
trying
to
clear
his
voice
and
to
speak
with
a
firm
tone
did
not
foresee
that
you
would
visit
this
retired
spot
indeed
i
myself
found
it
out
yesterday
only
and
struck
by
its
quiet
beauty
revisited
it
this
have
then
been
in
the
neighbourhood
some
days
at
least
said
flora
with
surprise
and
added
in
a
reproachful
tone
have
not
called
to
see
my
father
or
or
myself
what
have
we
done
vivian
to
occasion
on
your
part
such
singular
conduct
have
we
offended
you
you
surely
should
know
we
would
not
lightly
do
no
oh
not
offended
me
replied
hal
quickly
and
earnestly
it
is
not
should
you
vivian
if
not
offended
refrain
from
paying
us
a
visit
if
even
one
of
mere
ceremony
she
returned
with
a
slightly
pouting
lip
because
pardon
me
miss
wilton
if
i
speak
with
too
much
plainness
i
would
not
for
my
own
happiness
pain
or
wound
you
but
i
feel
some
explanation
of
my
recent
and
future
conduct
is
due
to
you
at
least
in
offering
this
explanation
i
may
be
inflicting
upon
you
some
disquiet
if
i
should
i
ask
in
anticipation
your
pardon
for
i
may
not
swerve
from
the
truth
in
what
i
shall
reveal
and
you
will
judge
that
whatever
may
be
its
effect
it
has
not
been
uttered
with
any
intention
to
displease
he
took
flora
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
the
spot
where
he
had
been
reclining
and
begged
her
to
be
seated
there
while
he
addressed
her
she
went
unresistingly
and
complied
with
his
request
her
heart
beat
violently
her
ears
burned
and
tingled
and
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
green
tremulous
grass
at
her
feet
yet
she
heard
clearly
and
distinctly
every
tone
of
his
rich
musical
voice
seemed
to
vibrate
upon
her
heart
and
to
bury
itself
therein
and
she
felt
as
if
she
could
sit
thus
and
listen
to
him
for
ever
wilton
he
said
will
be
brief
for
what
i
have
to
say
should
be
so
for
your
sake
and
for
my
own
the
sooner
it
is
over
the
better
our
acquaintance
has
been
spread
over
some
years
but
it
has
been
limited
in
its
character
the
events
of
the
past
few
months
have
thrown
us
into
more
intimate
relation
and
have
resulted
in
creating
an
influence
over
me
which
time
can
never
efface
i
have
come
to
know
this
to
know
miss
wilton
that
your
gentle
nature
no
less
than
your
other
perfections
have
absorbed
all
of
passion
of
love
i
may
ever
hope
to
have
and
this
at
a
time
when
it
is
forced
upon
me
that
your
position
and
birth
are
far
removed
above
mine
that
any
hopes
i
might
entertain
or
wishes
i
might
form
would
be
unjust
to
you
i
feel
and
that
they
are
improbable
of
realization
i
can
not
deny
to
myself
i
have
probed
my
heart
my
soul
and
find
that
change
in
my
feelings
towards
you
can
never
come
i
could
not
therefore
continue
to
visit
you
to
have
you
ever
in
my
eyes
and
know
that
you
could
never
never
be
mine
i
could
not
see
you
often
and
look
upon
your
heavenly
face
listen
to
the
music
of
your
words
grow
faint
beneath
the
soft
gaze
of
your
quiet
tender
eyes
and
content
myself
with
that
bliss
without
seeking
to
raise
in
your
heart
the
same
love
that
burned
in
mine
i
tried
to
induce
myself
to
do
this
i
tried
to
believe
that
i
could
remain
near
you
watch
over
you
as
a
guardian
spirit
and
be
happy
in
the
thought
that
i
could
shield
you
from
danger
or
from
sorrow
that
i
could
see
calmly
another
wear
the
gem
i
would
give
almost
existence
to
possess
but
oh
flora
i
am
but
human
miserably
weakly
human
my
love
is
selfish
at
least
in
this
i
can
not
look
upon
you
in
the
possession
of
another
so
i
have
come
to
the
determination
to
leave
this
country
for
ever
and
in
some
distant
land
struggle
with
my
hopeless
passion
as
best
i
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
his
lip
quivered
with
the
strong
emotion
which
convulsed
his
frame
he
pressed
his
trembling
lip
with
his
teeth
and
then
went
on
had
intended
to
have
spared
myself
the
pang
of
parting
with
you
for
ever
but
it
was
not
to
be
i
came
down
here
to
gaze
my
last
upon
the
roof
that
sheltered
you
to
obtain
if
possible
one
last
look
upon
your
dear
form
to
breathe
a
prayer
for
your
eternal
happiness
can
not
bear
it
cried
flora
springing
to
her
feet
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
flung
herself
upon
his
neck
must
not
go
hal
she
cried
with
intense
excitement
must
not
shall
not
leave
me
i
should
break
my
heart
i
should
die
if
you
were
parted
from
me
he
pressed
her
with
passionate
ardour
to
his
breast
his
heart
wras
too
full
to
utter
a
word
nothing
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
quiet
air
but
the
gentle
warbling
of
a
lonely
bird
the
plaintive
chant
of
the
running
stream
and
low
sobbing
chapter
mark
wilton
think
not
i
love
him
though
i
ask
for
him
but
a
peevish
boy
yet
he
talks
well
but
what
care
i
for
words
yet
words
do
well
when
he
that
speaks
them
pleases
those
that
hear
it
is
a
pretty
youth
not
very
pretty
but
sure
proud
and
yet
his
pride
becomes
him
shakspere
when
helen
grahame
opened
her
eyes
after
a
somewhat
protracted
sleep
she
looked
around
her
for
a
minute
in
unutterable
surprise
the
morning
previously
she
had
awakened
in
an
agony
of
sorrow
it
is
true
but
to
look
upon
all
the
luxurious
refinements
and
comforts
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
sleeping
chambers
of
the
wealthy
alone
now
she
beheld
herself
in
a
small
the
bed
appointments
being
evidently
supplemental
and
not
fitly
pertaining
to
the
room
clean
they
were
but
vastly
inferior
in
material
and
pattern
to
what
she
had
been
accustomed
a
fire
was
burning
clearly
in
the
small
grate
and
a
kettle
steaming
and
singing
cheerfully
stood
upon
the
hob
upon
a
table
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
spread
the
breakfast
appurtenances
and
at
the
window
sat
a
young
girl
plying
her
needle
with
a
rapidity
and
skill
something
magical
in
its
character
a
moment
more
and
helen
grahame
realised
her
position
she
remembered
her
terrible
conversation
with
truebody
her
nurse
the
charge
and
her
own
fearful
conviction
of
its
truth
she
remembered
the
sleepless
horrors
of
that
dreadful
night
the
simulated
sleep
at
dawn
the
absence
of
the
nurse
the
hasty
dressing
the
scribbled
note
the
slinking
glide
down
the
staircase
the
swift
dash
into
the
garden
and
the
rapid
exit
as
it
happened
unseen
by
the
private
entrance
she
had
a
confused
recollection
of
streets
crowded
with
throngs
of
people
of
the
roar
of
carriages
the
bewildering
turmoil
of
active
daily
business
life
and
then
faint
and
weak
of
a
long
long
dreamy
rest
upon
a
seat
in
an
open
park
of
wild
schemes
for
the
future
floating
through
her
brain
without
the
power
to
reduce
them
to
practicability
of
a
sinking
foreboding
sense
of
helplessness
a
startling
perception
that
she
must
starve
and
die
and
she
shivered
and
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
remembered
the
grim
water
remembered
how
like
a
magnet
it
drew
her
towards
it
how
it
wooed
her
with
a
low
dirge
the
burden
of
which
was
that
hugh
was
there
how
it
offered
her
eternal
repose
and
stilled
its
surface
so
that
calmness
and
peace
seemed
alone
to
be
found
within
its
placid
bosom
then
she
remembered
the
small
voice
that
rose
up
and
made
a
claim
on
life
the
agonized
struggle
that
followed
the
sudden
interposition
of
a
stranger
the
deep
voice
of
lester
vane
being
saved
from
his
loathly
arms
and
on
on
incident
by
incident
until
her
eyes
and
thoughts
rested
upon
the
face
of
the
young
fair
girl
who
sat
at
the
window
her
eyes
bent
fixedly
upon
her
work
and
her
hand
swiftly
and
unceasingly
moving
to
and
fro
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
made
her
her
that
she
was
now
the
only
friend
she
had
in
the
wide
wide
world
and
that
but
for
her
she
would
have
been
at
this
moment
face
to
face
with
an
offended
creator
that
but
for
her
she
must
now
even
become
a
wretched
outcast
she
began
to
see
that
pride
was
a
hollow
phantom
powerless
to
serve
at
need
that
selfishness
slaughtered
sympathy
and
repelled
friendship
that
true
worth
and
pure
human
philanthropy
were
to
be
found
in
the
humble
that
human
creatures
were
human
clay
alike
and
the
distinctions
of
the
world
proved
their
shadowy
nature
by
melting
away
at
the
first
touch
of
adversity
she
saw
that
the
young
girl
who
had
saved
her
was
what
the
world
calls
humble
she
involuntarily
placed
her
hands
before
her
eyes
and
felt
how
humble
she
herself
was
by
comparison
in
the
eyes
of
god
presently
she
felt
soft
fingers
gently
drawing
her
hands
from
her
eyes
and
she
heard
a
sweet
low
voice
it
said
not
weep
pray
do
not
it
will
make
you
ill
and
me
so
wretched
tears
are
foes
when
they
deter
us
from
doing
our
duty
to
ourselves
will
you
not
rise
and
dress
we
will
talk
of
the
future
over
breakfast
do
you
know
miss
i
have
secured
you
the
dearest
little
room
next
to
this
where
nobody
can
intrude
upon
you
and
where
i
will
strive
to
make
you
as
cheerful
and
as
happy
as
i
can
if
you
should
feel
depressed
and
lonely
as
at
times
i
daresay
you
will
but
you
know
that
you
have
had
too
much
indulgence
in
grief
just
now
and
so
you
must
dry
your
eyes
and
exert
yourself
come
come
you
will
try
to
oblige
me
will
you
not
helen
caught
her
hands
in
her
own
with
a
sudden
clutch
and
pressed
them
to
her
burning
lips
then
she
flung
back
her
dark
tresses
from
her
face
of
marble
hue
over
which
escaped
from
their
bands
they
had
straggled
will
exert
myself
she
said
will
face
my
trial
i
will
be
firm
and
meet
the
worst
as
becomes
a
no
no
no
not
that
name
i
must
breathe
that
name
no
once
again
she
pressed
her
hands
convulsively
over
her
eyes
but
she
removed
them
quickly
with
me
she
said
will
not
distress
you
again
by
giving
way
to
my
sorrow
but
with
patience
and
fortitude
i
will
look
back
on
the
past
and
await
the
lotte
replied
in
hopeful
language
and
assisted
her
to
dress
she
saw
with
an
astonishment
she
could
scarcely
conceal
how
much
help
her
guest
required
and
how
natural
it
seemed
for
her
to
expect
it
to
be
afforded
her
helen
on
the
other
hand
could
not
avoid
noticing
how
unused
lotte
was
to
her
task
and
said
with
a
faint
smile
must
learn
to
dress
myself
it
will
serve
to
pave
the
way
for
the
many
changes
i
shall
have
to
encounter
i
shall
no
doubt
be
troublesome
to
you
at
first
but
i
trust
by
persevering
efforts
to
acquire
that
selfreliance
i
now
understand
to
be
so
essential
to
my
new
condition
in
and
she
kept
her
word
at
first
she
looked
upon
every
feature
of
her
altered
position
with
wonder
the
novelty
of
the
circumstances
by
which
she
was
surrounded
helped
in
some
degree
to
alleviate
her
anguish
and
served
to
teach
her
a
lesson
of
life
she
could
scarcely
have
obtained
through
any
other
medium
everything
about
her
was
different
to
what
she
had
been
accustomed
life
itself
seemed
to
be
squeezed
into
such
narrow
limits
the
rooms
the
sparse
furniture
the
appointments
at
meals
even
the
meals
themselves
with
no
one
to
wait
at
table
to
hand
anything
all
seemed
small
and
and
she
kept
wondering
why
the
apartments
should
be
so
cramped
and
why
the
comforts
and
the
luxuries
she
had
possessed
at
home
were
not
here
she
even
hinted
so
much
to
lotte
who
explained
to
her
that
the
distinction
was
occasioned
by
the
difference
of
income
poor
lotte
she
had
flattered
herself
that
her
little
room
was
a
small
terrestrial
paradise
however
she
did
not
spare
herself
but
went
so
much
into
her
own
circumstances
as
to
show
that
by
incessant
labour
she
realised
an
income
which
when
fairly
justly
and
economically
apportioned
enabled
her
to
accomplish
no
more
than
helen
saw
around
her
helen
heard
the
amount
of
her
weekly
earnings
with
an
air
of
incredulity
it
be
possible
that
you
toil
so
long
and
so
wearily
for
a
sum
so
small
she
asked
but
i
am
rather
fortunate
said
lotte
with
a
cheerful
smile
and
added
with
a
grave
and
thoughtful
face
miss
grahame
many
many
hundred
girls
and
women
some
with
families
work
harder
and
longer
hours
than
i
do
for
less
than
half
that
i
have
in
a
moment
squandered
thrice
that
amount
on
the
veriest
trifles
upon
which
i
have
not
looked
a
second
time
said
helen
with
a
deep
sigh
lotte
changed
the
conversation
and
perceiving
as
well
as
conceiving
how
much
helen
would
feel
the
change
from
her
splendid
home
to
these
humble
apartments
did
all
in
her
power
by
cheerfulness
of
manner
and
by
paying
her
every
attention
to
lighten
her
care
and
to
make
her
moments
pass
at
least
peacefully
she
had
to
work
later
at
night
and
to
submit
to
some
small
privations
of
which
helen
knew
nothing
to
accomplish
her
generous
kindness
but
she
felt
rewarded
in
seeing
that
helen
was
softened
by
her
considerate
and
thoughtful
conduct
in
noting
too
that
the
dull
settled
cloud
upon
her
brow
was
gradually
passing
away
nature
was
of
that
mixed
kind
found
mostly
in
women
of
her
class
because
its
faults
are
mainly
those
created
by
position
and
false
teachers
she
was
gifted
with
all
the
tenderness
pertaining
to
a
gentle
loving
creature
but
she
possessed
also
an
indomitable
haughtiness
which
had
been
fostered
and
cultivated
by
her
proud
mother
her
had
been
permitted
to
have
its
course
until
it
grew
into
a
tyranny
because
her
weak
proud
parent
believed
it
to
be
a
symbol
of
high
breeding
she
ruled
all
beneath
her
with
a
lofty
domination
taught
by
those
who
alone
claimed
control
over
her
actions
that
such
a
line
of
conduct
became
the
eldest
daughter
of
an
ancient
house
all
the
soft
and
endearing
qualities
which
she
possessed
were
pressed
back
and
allowed
few
opportunities
of
appearing
they
did
now
and
then
peep
forth
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
from
a
sky
overspread
with
a
cold
austere
pall
but
it
was
only
when
nature
rebelled
and
would
make
a
sign
to
show
that
they
had
not
been
slain
outright
by
harsh
conventional
forms
helen
was
at
once
impassioned
and
ambitious
but
having
given
her
entire
control
she
suffered
impulses
to
govern
her
hence
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
which
had
transpired
between
her
and
hugh
riversdale
she
saw
him
and
was
struck
with
his
handsome
face
and
noble
bearing
as
he
was
by
her
beauty
he
became
the
ardent
wooer
but
in
secret
his
burning
looks
his
fervid
language
his
tender
adoration
created
a
new
feeling
in
her
breast
love
and
passion
sprang
up
in
her
soul
together
and
she
suffered
them
to
proceed
in
their
course
impetuously
without
an
attempt
to
arrest
or
check
their
career
her
mother
and
her
instructors
taking
their
cue
from
her
father
had
been
more
careful
to
instil
into
her
mind
the
doctrines
and
practices
of
pride
than
the
precepts
of
religion
or
the
practice
of
morality
she
loved
hugh
with
all
the
fierceness
of
an
ungovernable
passion
and
she
let
it
have
its
way
they
had
met
in
secret
and
the
notion
of
having
a
secret
pleased
her
she
kept
it
as
such
it
is
just
to
her
to
say
that
she
had
no
sense
of
having
committed
wrong
or
any
act
of
shame
or
sin
she
had
been
from
infancy
taught
and
permitted
to
exercise
her
and
she
did
it
in
this
with
what
result
we
have
seen
a
veil
had
now
fallen
from
before
her
eyes
she
saw
whither
her
faults
had
hurried
her
and
she
prepared
to
undergo
the
penance
imposed
upon
her
without
shrinking
from
its
rigour
or
attempting
to
evade
its
obligations
in
the
hurry
of
her
flight
she
had
not
thought
of
the
means
of
providing
for
the
future
and
save
a
few
pounds
which
happened
to
be
in
her
purse
she
had
brought
no
money
with
her
it
suggested
itself
to
her
now
that
she
would
need
more
when
the
trifle
she
possessed
was
gone
but
where
was
it
to
come
from
she
felt
that
lotte
would
solve
that
problem
for
her
apply
to
those
whom
she
had
quitted
she
would
not
but
she
had
some
skill
with
her
needle
and
she
hoped
to
be
able
to
assist
her
young
benefactor
at
first
in
order
that
ultimately
she
might
be
able
to
produce
the
means
requisite
for
her
own
support
some
two
or
three
days
had
elapsed
ere
she
had
come
to
comprehend
her
position
in
its
true
light
but
when
she
did
she
applied
herself
to
the
work
before
her
bravely
charles
clinton
had
called
to
see
his
sister
as
he
promised
upon
the
following
day
and
after
a
few
inquiries
respecting
her
companion
of
the
previous
evening
which
lotte
answered
evasively
he
gave
her
a
narrative
of
his
rapid
voyage
to
the
united
states
and
back
and
prolonged
it
hoping
that
her
friend
who
he
understood
resided
in
the
next
room
would
appear
he
guessed
that
there
was
some
mystery
connected
with
her
and
the
surmise
set
him
longing
to
know
what
it
could
be
but
as
lotte
did
not
volunteer
a
word
about
her
and
he
knew
her
firmness
on
certain
points
he
felt
it
would
be
useless
to
question
her
the
mysterious
lady
did
not
notwithstanding
that
he
spun
his
narrative
out
present
herself
to
his
eyes
and
as
lotte
told
him
that
he
could
not
stay
there
all
night
and
that
it
was
quite
time
he
was
at
home
he
rose
laughingly
kissed
her
affectionately
took
his
departure
determining
to
return
shortly
and
abruptly
that
he
might
pop
upon
the
strange
lady
in
his
apartment
the
day
succeeding
this
a
smart
ring
at
the
bell
conducted
lotte
down
to
the
street
door
and
there
she
saw
bantom
standing
glowing
in
his
best
clothes
and
smiling
over
the
edges
of
a
tall
white
but
he
had
a
most
unfavourable
looking
black
eye
and
strips
of
plaster
were
placed
upon
his
nose
his
cheekbone
and
his
forehead
lotte
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
but
immediately
welcomed
him
and
invited
him
up
to
her
little
room
asking
in
rather
a
loud
tone
as
she
ascended
the
stairs
how
bantom
and
all
the
little
bantoms
were
a
signal
which
was
responded
to
by
her
finding
her
room
untenanted
when
she
reached
it
she
bade
bantom
sit
down
and
begged
him
to
excuse
her
working
while
he
talked
for
she
could
listen
and
stitch
too
she
had
a
presentiment
that
this
was
not
a
mere
visit
of
ceremony
but
it
had
reference
to
the
disordered
aspect
of
his
visage
perhaps
her
help
was
needed
and
if
it
were
so
so
far
as
it
was
possible
she
was
ready
and
anxious
to
afford
it
but
no
it
turned
out
not
to
be
the
object
of
visit
he
explained
that
he
had
called
upon
her
the
night
before
the
one
preceding
and
that
without
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
say
who
he
was
and
why
he
was
in
this
locality
the
police
had
seized
upon
him
in
the
most
tyranical
manner
and
bore
him
to
the
took
five
on
to
do
it
miss
he
said
with
a
cunning
and
a
satisfied
smile
when
i
came
to
matters
to
the
inspector
he
said
i
been
werry
hardly
used
he
dismissed
me
at
once
and
suspended
the
policeman
as
first
collared
me
and
going
to
bring
a
action
agin
him
and
the
lawyer
says
i
shall
get

damages
but
lor

that

about

becos

matter
consarning

bit
of
good
fortin

echoed
lotte
in
surprise
then
she
added
with
a
smile

be
very
acceptable
to
me
you
you

my
mind
when

returned
lotte
laughing
have
heard
you
say
that
is
that
handsome
you
remember
that
you
i
sticks
to
it
cried
bantom
slapping
his
thigh
done
the
thing
handsome
to
me
and
to
everybody
sure
and
as
handsome
a
young
beauty
as
ever
walked
to
my
thinking
ah
and
to
others
too
as
lotte
raised
her
finger
and
turning
her
soft
sweet
laughing
eyes
upon
him
she
said
bantom
if
you
continue
in
this
praiseful
strain
i
shall
think
you
have
come
here
only
to
court
me
and
what
will
bantom
say
to
that
when
i
tell
her
bantom
indulged
in
a
short
howl
for
him
to
court
her
would
have
been
in
his
eyes
an
attempt
to
be
palliated
only
on
the
ground
of
the
wildest
lunacy
thinks
then
said
he
smoothing
the
long
nap
of
his
new
carefully
with
his
better
on
that
pint
and
at
once
let
you
know
why
come
you
remember
that
orful
night
when
you
went
out
in
the
evening
and
come
back
agin
the
tears
sprang
into
eyes
do
indeed
she
replied
in
a
low
tone
he
continued
the
next
morning
a
flunkey
comes
to
me
dressed
in
pupple
livery
and
brings
a
fippun
note
in
a
letter
from
you
the
lord
bless
your
thoughtful
natur
go
on
what
of
that
circumstance
said
lotte
with
an
aspect
of
wonder
said
bantom
few
days
ago
that
same
pupple
flunkey
comes
to
me
and
axes
me
a
lot
of
questions
about
me
ejaculated
lotte
astonished
could
he
wish
to
know
about
me
miss
wilton
his
mistress
is
acquainted
with
my
address
and
would
write
here
to
me
if
she
wished
to
see
and
speak
with
it
his
young
missus
as
wants
to
know
but
his
young
master
i
suxpexs
observed
bantom
with
a
knowing
nod
young
master
said
lotte
turning
a
crimson
brother
only
suxpexs
mind
jest
as
much
as
that
he
said
a
gentleman
day
did
he
come
to
you
did
you
say
bantom
counted
on
his
fingers
days
ago
he
replied
it
could
not
have
been
he
said
lotte
to
herself
a
sigh
unconsciously
escaping
her
lips
bantom
proceeded
answer
until
i
what
he
wanted
with
you
he
observed
was
right
and
kind
of
you
bantom
responded
lotte
thoughtfully
said
the
simple
fellow
he
told
me
that
a
as
he
knew
had
taken
a
great
interest
in
your
welfare
and
he
like
to
think
that
such
a
pretty
girl
as
you
i
beg
pardon
miss
them
was
his
very
words
should
be
working
your
eyes
out
your
when
you
orter
be
in
a
carriage
of
your
own
and
therefore
he
wants
to
see
you
and
come
to
a
arrangement
with
you
whereby
he
will
give
you
a
and
a
carriage
and
to
make
a
lady
on
you
so
that
you
should
never
to
work
no
lotte
listened
to
him
in
breathless
astonishment
gradually
as
he
proceeded
she
felt
her
neck
face
and
brow
burn
as
if
a
hectic
fever
raged
there
in
the
intensity
of
her
scorn
at
this
proposal
the
purpose
of
which
with
a
quickness
and
penetration
she
at
once
comprehended
her
power
of
speech
almost
failed
her
but
by
an
effort
she
cleared
her
throat
and
said
did
the
servant
mention
the
name
no
replied
bantom
not
perceiving
her
emotion
do
that
i
axed
him
but
he
said
the
gentleman
do
that
hisself
when
he
saw
lotte
drew
a
long
breath
and
fixing
her
eyes
upon
face
with
a
steadfast
gaze
to
read
all
that
was
passing
within
his
mind
she
said
gravely
you
heard
this
extraordinary
offer
made
bantom
what
did
you
think
of
it
what
said
you
in
reply
face
brightened
up
said
he
answered
earnestly
you
deserved
all
the
good
the
lord
could
shower
upon
you
in
this
life
and
i
told
him
it
would
be
a
day
for
me
when
i
that
you
a
fortun
and
was
a
in
your
own
lotte
saw
that
bantom
in
his
simplicity
of
heart
did
not
detect
the
intention
disguised
in
this
liberal
offer
but
that
he
believed
it
to
be
a
genuine
sample
of
philanthropy
on
the
part
of
some
wealthy
romantic
individual
you
mention
my
address
she
inquired
anxiously
pupple
wanted
that
badly
he
did
returned
bantom
smoothing
his
rough
though
new
beaver
hat
my
wife
said
no
it
be
best
to
leave
all
in
your
she
was
quite
sure
act
the
right
down
true
bantom
said
lotte
laying
her
hand
gently
upon
his
arm
and
looking
him
sadly
in
the
face
wife
was
right
in
her
suggestion
and
you
too
in
following
it
i
know
not
who
the
person
is
who
has
thus
singled
me
out
for
cruel
insult
but
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
the
nature
of
the
errand
upon
which
you
have
been
sent
to
me
you
have
seen
at
night
in
the
street
a
poor
frail
creature
wearing
a
hollow
smile
upon
her
painted
face
daunting
in
a
gaudy
dress
shunned
by
the
respectable
of
her
own
sex
and
frequently
harshly
repelled
of
treated
as
a
shameless
object
by
numbers
of
yours
a
being
whose
position
is
at
once
horrifying
to
the
virtuously
disposed
and
a
misery
and
a
curse
to
herself
but
the
position
of
this
poor
abandoned
outcast
is
less
degraded
than
that
of
the
which
the
gentleman
of
whom
you
have
spoken
would
make
me
because
into
her
sin
and
shame
the
first
may
have
been
driven
by
dreadful
destitution
while
the
other
voluntarily
purchases
her
pollution
by
empty
phantoms
of
luxury
but
remains
still
an
object
of
scorn
and
the
truth
struck
bantom
now
his
face
darkened
until
it
became
almost
purple
the
veins
in
his
throat
and
forehead
swelled
like
cords
he
ground
his
teeth
as
if
he
would
reduce
them
to
powder
and
he
clenched
his
hands
burying
his
nails
in
the
palms
at
length
a
groan
burst
from
his
heaving
chest
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
cried
hoarsely
and
rapidly
that
i
should
been
picked
out
to
come
with
such
a
object
to
you
i
know
it
miss
oh
i
know
it
by
the
living
lord
i
never
forgive
me
you
you
i
deserve
it
but
miss
i
shall
see
pupplesuit
agen
nip
him
i
will
make
him
tell
me
who
sent
him
to
me
about
you
and
when
squeezed
out
of
him
the
name
drag
the
hound
here
and
force
him
on
his
bended
knees
to
beg
parding
on
you
i
will
i
bantom
as
he
concluded
darted
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
of
farewell
he
rushed
down
stairs
into
the
street
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
a
loud
bang
ere
she
could
overtake
him
she
followed
him
to
the
street
opened
the
door
to
look
after
him
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
mark
wilton
they
recognized
each
other
instantly
and
lotte
unconsciously
for
the
moment
forgot
bantom
for
mark
smiled
agreeably
upon
her
and
she
could
not
somehow
help
smiling
pleasantly
upon
him
in
return
mark
put
out
his
hand
and
she
placed
hers
in
it
a
commonplace
salutation
enough
but
it
did
not
convey
to
either
in
the
present
instance
that
impression
mark
evidently
wished
to
be
invited
to
enter
the
house
and
lotte
blushing
like
a
rose
passed
the
compliment
upon
him
not
feeling
altogether
sure
that
she
was
acting
in
accordance
with
the
strict
rules
of
rigid
propriety
however
mark
found
himself
seated
in
the
little
room
admiring
its
tasteful
neatness
and
chirruping
to
the
little
song
bird
who
hopped
about
his
perch
laid
his
head
knowingly
on
one
side
and
cried
to
him
almost
as
familiarly
as
it
did
to
lotte
shall
make
no
stranger
of
you
wilton
said
lotte
renewing
her
work
am
very
busy
and
my
work
has
to
be
finished
at
a
stated
make
a
stranger
of
me
i
beg
responded
mark
somewhat
earnestly
for
after
every
inspection
of
figure
and
face
he
grew
more
anxious
for
friendly
relations
with
her
will
talk
and
you
can
work
and
talk
too
said
lotte
with
a
laugh
sex
are
not
very
good
listeners
unless
they
have
the
power
to
interpolate
frequently
you
know
but
i
will
try
to
be
a
model
of
attention
and
goodness
so
commence
if
you
please
am
acquainted
with
your
merits
and
your
virtues
returned
mark
brother
enlarged
upon
them
as
we
came
across
the
atlantic
together
i
knew
a
great
deal
about
you
before
i
saw
you
but
i
was
not
quite
prepared
i
confess
on
meeting
you
to
find
stand
convicted
of
such
gross
exaggeration
as
a
result
of
his
blind
partiality
interposed
lotte
quickly
you
err
miss
clinton
what
i
intended
to
say
reference
to
your
sister
and
your
father
you
told
me
so
you
know
wilton
when
you
came
in
again
interrupted
lotte
this
time
her
cheek
heightened
its
colour
and
her
smile
gave
place
to
rather
a
grave
look
mark
wilton
bowed
feel
your
reproof
miss
clinton
he
said
hastily
acquit
me
of
having
any
intention
to
offend
you
and
believe
me
i
will
not
again
give
you
cause
to
complain
of
the
tone
of
my
she
turned
upon
him
an
expression
of
such
beaming
gratefulness
that
he
was
amply
repaid
for
the
momentary
pang
her
observation
recalling
him
to
the
object
of
his
visit
and
the
grave
look
with
which
it
was
accompanied
occasioned
him
he
saw
at
once
that
in
her
humble
isolated
position
she
demanded
his
respect
she
perceived
by
the
instant
alteration
in
his
manner
that
he
was
ready
sincerely
to
accord
it
not
but
that
he
had
at
first
involuntarily
paid
it
and
was
now
only
straying
from
it
because
he
had
been
led
away
by
the
turn
of
the
conversation
and
his
sense
of
the
prettiness
of
her
face
as
he
saw
the
rising
blush
upon
her
clear
transparent
cheek
he
felt
himself
become
red
too
and
he
thought
it
was
very
ridiculous
it
was
at
this
moment
their
eyes
met
and
he
received
her
grateful
glance
with
a
glow
of
deep
gratification
and
she
read
a
language
in
his
gaze
which
no
words
could
have
framed
there
was
an
embarrassing
silence
for
a
minute
and
then
mark
dashed
abruptly
at
the
subject
of
his
visit
it
appeared
from
what
he
stated
that
although
he
had
been
to
his
late
abode
in
the
park
he
had
not
made
himself
known
there
because
his
father
and
sister
had
quitted
for
the
country
but
had
contented
himself
by
making
a
few
inquiries
and
in
ascertaining
their
present
address
he
said
too
that
he
had
endeavoured
to
see
his
old
friend
and
companion
harry
vivian
but
had
not
succeeded
as
he
too
was
away
from
home
some
business
he
had
to
transact
in
london
he
added
was
likely
to
detain
him
about
a
week
and
therefore
he
told
her
that
it
had
struck
him
that
it
would
be
as
well
if
he
could
obtain
some
little
account
of
the
changes
that
had
occurred
during
his
absence
from
england
to
his
relatives
that
he
might
be
somewhat
prepared
for
the
new
condition
in
which
he
had
been
assured
he
should
find
them
and
he
looked
to
lotte
as
the
person
most
capable
of
affording
him
that
information
now
ordinarily
there
would
be
nothing
of
interest
or
importance
likely
to
grow
out
of
such
an
interview
and
mark
might
have
put
his
questions
and
lotte
replied
to
them
without
anything
arising
to
move
them
out
of
the
even
tenour
of
their
way
but
it
happened
that
lotte
possessed
charms
of
feature
and
person
of
a
peculiarly
attractive
kind
and
mark
was
possessed
of
discrimination
and
taste
in
addition
to
this
he
was
gifted
with
an
extremely
handsome
face
being
a
likeness
of
his
sister
flora
and
as
lotte
had
taste
and
discernment
too
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
during
the
questioning
and
the
replies
that
each
should
gradually
confirm
the
favourable
opinion
of
the
other
which
they
had
in
the
first
instance
formed
we
are
loth
to
confess
it
but
at
least
two
hours
flew
by
before
mark
or
lotte
had
a
notion
of
the
length
to
which
the
interview
had
extended
and
then
mark
rose
quite
aware
that
it
was
time
to
leave
he
was
very
reluctant
to
do
so
but
he
obtained
permission
to
come
again
if
once
if
only
once
to
say
good
bye
to
her
and
to
convey
a
message
to
flora
ha
lotte
had
forgotten
that
he
remembered
it
that
is
to
say
he
conceived
the
suggestion
because
it
pointed
to
an
opportunity
of
calling
upon
lotte
at
some
future
time
with
her
reply
lotte
was
glad
he
had
remembered
it
she
said
she
was
and
in
truth
she
was
for
without
acknowledging
so
much
to
herself
she
was
pleased
to
think
that
there
would
be
an
opportunity
of
seeing
him
again
soon
at
last
he
was
gone
and
lotte
sat
down
to
her
work
to
think
of
him
to
ply
her
needle
swiftly
and
mechanically
to
have
the
material
upon
which
she
worked
every
now
and
then
blotted
out
from
her
sight
and
nothing
left
in
its
place
but
a
rich
brown
face
and
deep
blue
eyes
yet
she
was
not
so
absorbed
by
her
own
pleasant
thoughts
that
she
wholly
forgot
one
who
needed
her
attention
and
who
she
knew
was
making
a
brave
effort
to
struggle
with
her
trial
of
deep
humiliation
to
endure
it
with
patience
and
to
frame
herself
to
meet
whatever
further
mortifications
and
privations
she
might
have
to
undergo
lotte
knew
that
to
keep
her
in
conversation
to
look
hopefully
and
in
a
sanguine
spirit
to
the
future
while
a
dead
silence
was
preserved
respecting
the
past
was
the
best
mode
of
lifting
her
out
of
a
killing
despondency
and
therefore
much
as
she
was
harrassed
by
the
incessant
application
her
work
demanded
of
her
she
still
in
her
pure
unselfishness
made
the
time
and
opportunity
to
keep
the
mind
of
helen
from
dwelling
upon
the
misery
of
her
situation
thus
when
sitting
thinking
of
mark
wilton
she
remembered
that
helen
was
alone
and
though
she
really
justly
had
not
an
instant
to
spare
from
her
task
she
ran
lightly
and
briskly
into
her
apartment
to
tell
her
that
she
was
again
free
from
visitors
and
to
persuade
her
to
come
and
sit
with
her
and
tell
her
all
about
the
beautiful
places
she
had
visited
abroad
she
found
helen
kneeling
by
her
bedside
her
face
buried
in
the
coverlet
and
her
hands
clasped
in
anguish
above
her
head
she
heard
her
sobs
and
bending
over
her
she
raised
her
tenderly
and
supported
her
in
her
arms
with
me
she
said
softly
and
sit
with
me
you
must
not
remain
alone
dear
young
lady
it
makes
you
too
sad
come
come
she
conducted
helen
gently
to
her
placed
her
upon
the
sofa
and
sat
by
her
side
she
pillowed
her
head
upon
her
own
soft
bosom
and
she
whispered
in
her
ear
affliction
is
sore
indeed
but
yet
be
comforted
for
if
all
that
you
have
told
me
be
true
and
from
my
depths
i
believe
you
there
is
a
limit
to
your
selfreproach
bitter
regret
and
wild
despair
should
be
the
last
emotions
of
a
dying
heart
he
yet
lives
be
sure
and
living
you
are
saved
oh
did
he
but
know
that
you
called
to
him
now
with
appealing
arms
how
he
would
fly
to
you
look
up
then
dear
young
lady
in
strong
conviction
that
god
is
merciful
and
beneficent
his
hand
has
been
laid
heavily
upon
you
but
if
it
has
pressed
you
down
believe
that
it
will
raise
you
up
and
sustain
you
in
the
time
to
by
unremitting
kindness
and
such
generous
sentiments
did
lotte
seek
to
win
her
from
the
indulgence
of
her
deep
sorrow
and
at
other
times
by
simple
questions
about
famous
cities
and
spots
of
which
she
had
only
heard
and
helen
had
visited
she
contrived
to
restore
her
to
something
like
calmness
it
was
while
speaking
almost
in
a
state
of
abstraction
that
eyes
involuntarily
fell
upon
a
glass
which
reflected
the
door
of
the
apartment
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
affrighted
surprise
pressed
her
hands
over
her
face
to
conceal
it
and
cowering
as
if
she
should
shrink
into
the
place
beneath
at
every
step
tottered
rather
than
ran
out
of
the
room
at
the
same
moment
lotte
was
startled
by
hearing
a
voice
whose
tones
were
quite
unknown
to
her
exclaim
pardon
let
me
disturb
anybody
i
want
to
see
miss
she
turned
round
in
her
seat
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
and
beheld
standing
in
the
doorway
a
young
gentleman
who
was
to
her
an
utter
stranger
chapter
the
compact
for
the
sport
to
have
the
engineer
hoist
with
his
own
petard
and
it
shall
go
hard
but
i
will
delve
one
yard
below
their
mines
and

moon
shakspere
chewkle
with
a
tolerably
large
sum
of
money
in
his
pocket
felt
quite
a
different
man
to
the
chewkle
hunted
like
a
fox
by
a
pack
of
policemen
or
a
fugitive
slave
according
to
his
own
view
of
the
matter
by
bloodhounds
he
was
a
cunning
fellow
was
chewkle
he
had
spoken
truth
when
he
stated
that
he
had
made
use
of
embezzled
the
money
entrusted
to
him
by
a
benefit
society
but
he
had
carefully
secreted
their
books
when
he
left
word
that
he
was
into
the
country
and
he
was
now
prepared
to
home
produce
his
books
carefully
made
up
hand
over
the
balance
and
commence
actions
at
law
for
slander
against
every
person
worth
sueing
whom
he
could
discover
to
have
spoken
prejudicially
against
him
his
place
of
abode
was
watched
but
not
so
closely
as
to
prevent
his
slinking
into
it
during
a
violent
shower
of
rain
unobserved
and
regaining
his
room
having
carefully
shut
out
every
possibility
of
a
light
breaking
through
a
chink
or
cranny
in
shutter
or
door
he
proceeded
to
light
a
lamp
to
fetch
out
his
books
to
set
them
in
order
and
when
that
was
done
to
sneak
to
bed
he
woke
with
the
dawn
and
got
away
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
man
set
to
watch
the
premises
inasmuch
as
that
individual
was
at
the
moment
tightly
hugged
in
the
arms
of
morpheus
chewkle
made
his
way
to
the
residence
of
jukes
who
received
him
with
a
grin
of
felicitous
surprise
as
he
knew
there
was
a
reward
offered
for
his
apprehension
and
he
instantly
resolved
to
obtain
it
by
handing
his
dear
old
pal
chewk
over
to
the
tender
attentions
of
the
police
this
hope
of
aggrandisement
was
dispelled
however
by
chewkle
confessing
his
knowledge
of
the
charges
made
against
him
and
that
the
police
were
after
him
the
books
to
show
all
straightforward
jukes
he
cried
snapping
his
fingers
the
ballence
suggested
jukes
forget
the
little
here
cried
chewkle
slapping
his
pocket
the
here
to
bring
fifty
actions
them
who
has
been
calling
me
hard
names
slandering
my
character
jukes
serve
every
man
on
with
a
writ
jukes
and
them
as
can
pay
foller
up
them
as
is
straw
screw
some
costs
out
on
eh
jukes
there
see
that
as
he
concluded
he
produced
a
fifty
pound
note
given
to
him
by
grahame
lots
more
where
that
came
from
he
cried
work
up
that
mine
until
got
a
pretty
trifle
out
on
jukes
looked
at
the
note
with
the
eyes
of
a
vulture
and
bent
towards
chewkle
with
the
manner
of
a
spaniel
he
adored
money
and
reverenced
those
who
possessed
it
being
himself
a
myrmidon
of
the
law
one
of
its
harshest
and
most
brutal
he
feared
its
operation
because
he
only
too
well
knew
its
power
he
had
been
suffering
his
tongue
to
wag
very
freely
in
defamation
of
chewkle
and
the
mention
of
an
action
made
him
sweat
with
nervous
apprehension
he
wrung
hand
as
though
he
would
twist
it
from
the
wrist
am
glad
of
this
old
boy
he
said
precious
glad
this
old
chewk
had
a
precious
fight
for
you
old
boy
i
said
come
back
to
shame
here
i
am
said
chewkle
with
the
sternness
of
assumed
innocence
serve
out
see
but
come
jukes
i
want
this
flimsy
changed
and
i
want
you
to
take
it
for
me
to
the
old
gal
in
threadneedle
ha
laughed
jukes
looking
blank
and
by
no
means
fascinated
with
the
proposition
ha
its
all
i
ha
ha
i
say
its
all
right
and
square
old
chewk
eh
one
of
who
been
speaking
me
behind
my
back
eh
asked
chewkle
in
a
very
significant
tone
jukes
laughed
vacantly
and
suggested
that
such
a
notion
was
utterly
preposterous
said
chewkle
look
there
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
a
name
written
on
the
back
of
the
note
see
that
name
park
you
now
you
can
put
the
name
and
address
of
chewkle
on
it
that
will
do
it
jukes
did
not
think
he
said
that
half
of
that
was
necessary
the
word
of
was
all
he
required
and
he
took
the
note
leaving
chewkle
to
await
his
return
he
returned
with
the
money
and
chewkle
in
pursuance
of
a
plan
he
had
formed
took
some
of
his
best
clothes
out
of
pledge
got
shaved
and
scoured
for
it
required
that
labour
to
get
his
flesh
cleaned
had
his
hair
cut
and
brushed
his
whiskers
trimmed
and
really
came
out
quite
smart
and
looking
very
much
as
of
old
like
an
individual
engaged
in
the
recovery
of
small
debts
making
a
variety
of
promises
largely
interlarded
with
boasts
to
juke
not
one
of
which
he
intended
to
redeem
he
made
his
way
to
his
friend
scorper
a
clerk
and
having
secured
his
services
proceeded
to
face
his
creditors
for
three
hours
the
turmoil
was
tremendous
he
was
given
into
custody
went
before
a
magistrate
was
charged
with
felonious
embezzlement
produced
his
books
and
the
balance
which
he
declared
himself
ready
to
hand
over
to
a
properly
constituted
person
appointed
by
the
society
itself
satisfied
the
magistrate
that
he
was
a
grossly
individual
was
discharged
and
obtained
subsequently
a
list
of
persons
who
having
called
him
with
great
truth
and
justice
a
rogue
and
swindler
he
instructed
scorper
to
proceed
against
them
all
for
defaming
his
precious
character
chewkle
had
a
deep
motive
in
all
this
he
knew
sufficient
of
human
nature
to
be
aware
that
his
present
triumph
coupled
with
the
actions
at
law
would
cause
people
who
had
been
busy
in
talking
about
him
speculating
on
his
movements
or
wondering
to
their
friends
what
he
was
up
to
to
take
no
further
notice
of
him
whatever
to
drop
him
as
he
said
to
himself
if
he
was
a
hot
he
was
going
in
now
for
a
desperate
stake
and
he
was
especially
anxious
that
his
future
movements
should
not
attract
attention
he
was
pretty
fairly
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
property
grahame
would
obtain
by
the
death
of
maybee
or
of
wilton
provided
the
latter
had
no
son
living
he
speculated
at
first
whether
he
should
gain
most
by
keeping
his
word
with
grahame
or
by
revealing
all
he
knew
to
wilton
but
a
little
reflection
soon
decided
him
that
he
could
obtain
more
continuous
gifts
from
grahame
than
wilton
because
he
should
be
able
to
put
on
a
screw
with
the
former
by
constant
threats
while
with
the
latter
it
would
be
only
by
appeals
to
his
gratitude
that
he
should
be
able
occasionally
to
obtain
money
after
the
first
reward
he
knew
that
men
soon
grow
tired
of
being
grateful
when
it
costs
them
money
he
did
himself
so
feeling
a
pretty
sure
conviction
that
he
should
be
able
by
the
pressure
of
threats
to
draw
the
largest
income
from
grahame
he
decided
upon
adhering
to
his
course
even
though
it
laid
the
crime
of
murder
upon
his
soul
the
spirit
of
acquisitiveness
was
however
strong
within
him
it
was
evident
to
him
that
money
was
to
be
extracted
from
wilton
by
holding
out
the
alluring
promise
of
producing
the
missing
evidence
necessary
to
secure
to
him
the
large
property
now
in
the
clutches
of
chancery
he
might
even
go
to
the
length
of
mentioning
the
name
of
maybee
and
other
particulars
necessary
to
prove
his
ability
to
perform
his
promise
before
he
put
the
poor
old
prisoner
out
of
the
way
of
being
produced
by
anybody
now
he
knew
from
two
or
three
sources
that
nathan
gomer
had
interested
himself
much
in
affairs
no
doubt
as
chewkle
surmised
at
a
swinging
profit
and
it
suggested
itself
to
him
that
he
would
be
the
man
to
apply
to
in
the
matter
nathan
would
listen
to
him
with
a
ready
ear
because
no
doubt
profit
was
to
be
made
out
of
the
transaction
and
nathan
had
the
ear
of
wilton
so
that
what
he
suggested
was
likely
to
be
carried
out
accordingly
chewkle
one
evening
directed
his
steps
to
the
chambers
of
the
remarkable
little
saffronfaced
dwarf
chewkle
had
no
favourable
opinion
of
the
individual
he
was
about
to
visit
he
had
an
uncomfortable
sense
that
the
satellites
of
satan
were
on
certain
conditions
permitted
to
visit
the
earth
to
lure
men
to
perdition
and
that
nathan
was
one
of
the
demoniacal
crew
he
the
notion
with
a
grim
laugh
every
time
it
presented
itself
but
he
could
not
drive
the
impression
away
in
one
of
the
dreariest
in
the
city
of
london
there
is
a
narrow
passage
leading
into
what
may
be
termed
a
duodecimo
square
it
contains
twelve
houses
the
floors
of
which
are
let
out
in
chambers
that
is
to
say
they
would
be
if
tenants
were
rife
but
only
a
few
can
boast
of
being
occupied
to
one
of
the
largest
gloomiest
and
dustiest
chewkle
advanced
upon
the
in
faded
black
letters
he
saw
painted
by
the
hands
of
a
writer
in
his
noviciate
the
words
floor
the
hour
was
so
far
advanced
that
lamps
in
the
streets
and
in
shop
windows
were
lighted
and
by
contrast
the
square
was
dark
still
chewlde
was
able
to
decipher
the
words
upon
the
but
the
staircase
was
uncomfortably
obscure
however
he
mounted
the
stairs
he
went
up
gently
as
though
plunder
being
his
object
he
had
no
wish
to
arouse
the
attention
of
any
inmate
he
felt
he
scarcely
knew
why
a
strange
apprehension
that
one
of
the
closed
doors
he
had
to
pass
would
as
he
reached
it
burst
open
and
some
frantic
individual
in
a
fit
of
wild
frenzy
dash
upon
him
and
seize
him
by
the
throat
on
the
assumption
that
he
chewkle
had
no
business
to
be
anywhere
but
in
the
or
at
dartmoor
he
paused
without
any
such
event
happening
before
the
door
upon
the
second
floor
it
was
awfully
dark
here
he
groped
for
a
door
and
found
an
outer
one
open
the
inner
door
was
closed
but
it
yielded
to
the
pressure
of
his
hand
and
opened
inwardly
the
room
within
was
intensely
dark
chewkle
gave
a
short
dry
cough
but
it
was
not
responded
to
is
out
he
thought
to
himself
and
has
forgotten
to
lock
his
chewkle
paused
to
take
breath
for
his
thoughts
oppressed
him
his
ideas
his
speculations
and
impressions
respecting
nathan
gomer
were
interwoven
with
and
sovereigns
with
and
diamonds
with
indian
riches
with
in
truth
wealth
inexhaustible
gomer
was
an
individual
in
his
estimation
who
trusted
none
of
his
valuables
to
other
care
save
such
moneys
as
he
advanced
on
undeniable
security
and
consequently
the
room
in
which
he
chewkle
was
then
standing
must
be
the
storehouse
of
fabulous
wealth
this
storehouse
in
an
indiscreet
moment
had
been
left
unguarded
unprotected
open
to
the
lustful
hand
of
any
lucky
individual
like
himself
who
dropping
in
promiscuously
as
he
had
done
could
enrich
himself
and
disappear
with
his
prize
swiftly
and
unobserved
leaving
no
trace
behind
him
chewkle
broke
out
into
a
nervous
perspiration
and
instantly
became
active
he
groped
about
for
the
table
which
no
doubt
had
a
drawer
where
the
keys
of
chests
containing
heaps
of
gold
and
notes
were
deposited
he
found
a
table
and
felt
for
the
coveted
drawer
then
he
uttered
a
roar
of
fright
in
a
corner
of
the
room
a
light
suddenly
displayed
itself
it
shone
brightly
on
the
face
of
nathan
gomer
grinning
hideously
at
him
in
another
moment
his
eyes
were
dazzled
to
blindness
by
the
light
being
turned
full
upon
his
own
face
he
heard
nathan
in
his
strange
shrill
voice
cry
chewkle
is
it
my
good
industrious
friend
chewkle
come
to
pay
me
a
visit
to
serve
me
of
course
and
himself
slightly
perhaps
how
do
you
do
chewkle
large
drops
of
cold
perspiration
rolled
down
that
forehead
he
tried
to
speak
but
for
the
minute
he
found
his
voice
was
gone
and
he
could
only
make
one
or
two
hoarse
sounds
in
his
throat
nathan
gomer
who
had
been
lying
screwed
up
in
an
arm
chair
now
rose
up
and
lighted
a
lamp
from
a
lantern
which
he
had
in
his
hand
and
then
he
motioned
to
chewkle
to
be
seated
found
the
door
open
abruptly
observed
chewkle
feeling
that
an
explanation
of
his
peculiar
proceedings
was
due
from
him
know
you
did
said
gomer
with
a
grin
opened
it
for
you
wire
and
spring
simple
said
chewkle
thought
you
was
out
and
had
left
valuable
property
he
and
you
were
trying
to
find
it
out
so
as
to
secure
it
eh
returned
nathan
with
a
grin
coughed
chewkle
i
it
was
very
dark
and
i
was
about
for
for
for
lucifer
box
i
suppose
suggested
nathan
sarcastically
jest
it
i
thought
to
myself
that
you
had
left
i
never
do
chewkle
i
am
not
of
an
absent
or
forgetful
nature
i
am
a
methodical
man
and
do
everything
systematically
well
now
have
a
light
you
are
seated
and
so
am
i
you
have
come
to
me
with
some
purpose
and
minutes
are
more
precious
than
gold
chewkle
to
your
business
at
gomer
what
i
likes
and
why
i
preferred
to
you
to
direct
to
wilton
sir
he
was
lately
in
the
bench
and
is
now
at
harleydale
manor
devon
a
friend
of
yourn
i
believe
business
is
directly
then
with
him
is
directly
affected
by
it
returned
chewkle
dropping
his
eyes
unable
to
endure
the
bright
gaze
of
the
little
you
desire
to
negociate
the
matter
through
me
continued
gomer
as
chewkle
paused
do
he
answered
said
gomer
laconically
wilton
is
claimant
to
a
large
property
in
devonshire
and
elsewhere
said
chewkle
i
have
been
concerned
for
grahame
of
course
you
know
i
am
aware
of
nathan
gomer
nodded
is
about
that
property
i
want
to
speak
to
you
sir
he
added
on
observed
nathan
drily
have
some
information
about
it
some
information
very
important
to
wilton
i
can
assure
hem
have
you
had
a
quarrel
with
grahame
inquired
nathan
sharply
sir
no
sir
returned
chewkle
a
very
good
friend
to
me
he
will
this
information
of
which
you
speak
affect
his
interest
with
regard
to
his
claim
to
the
devonshire
property
asked
nathan
gomer
regarding
chewkle
with
a
fixed
gaze
him
there
sir
responded
chewkle
knock
him
out
of
my
good
chewkle
you
suggest
that
he
is
your
very
kind
friend
eh
for
the
matter
that
he
is
sir
but
you
sir
are
a
man
of
the
world
i
says
a
distinguished
man
of
the
world
am
i
right
am
prepared
to
concede
that
point
to
save
time
responded
nathan
gomer
with
a
grin
sir
the
very
vallyble
information
i
possess
make
grahame
inherit
that
property
though
he
still
prefers
a
claim
to
it
but
it
will
actually
put
wilton
into
possession
of
will
completely
establish
his
claim
to
it
exclaimed
chewkle
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
adding
information
worth
having
i
should
said
nathan
gomer
coolly
wilton
has
had
in
his
day
many
such
offers
but
they
turned
out
moonshine
all
of
them
how
is
he
to
know
that
your
information
is
any
better
than
that
which
has
already
proved
worthless
explain
why
in
a
very
few
words
answered
chewkle
so
said
nathan
know
sir
better
than
i
do
that
the
marriage
of
father
and
mother
is
a
pint
in
their
register
of
marriage
was
cut
out
the
parish
book
and
the
cetiffykit
has
never
been
found
but
it
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
possession
of
a
cousin
who
has
a
claim
to
some
part
of
the
true
very
correct
responded
gomer
still
cool
but
nevertheless
edging
his
chair
a
little
closer
to
chewkle
this
man
disappeared
many
years
did
good
if
he
can
be
found
and
produced
all
the
property
will
become
quite
see
the
force
of
that
conclusion
friend
you
look
here
this
man
maybee
maybee
that
is
his
maybee
this
maybee
maybee
i
think
joshua
joshua
ah
yes
old
fellow
among
his
pals
in
spike
hotel
is
called
josh
be
sure
very
probable
go
on
good
chewkle
said
nathan
gomer
with
glittering
eyes
and
a
glowing
face
but
just
now
without
a
grin
upon
his
features
if
this
cousin
is
brought
forward
he
can
produce
no
doubt
the
cetiffykit
of
the
marriage
of
father
and
mother
and
by
proving
his
legitimacy
substantiate
his
claim
to
the
true
very
feasible
but
suppose
he
produce
the
certificate
my
chewkle
what
then
was
present
at
the
marriage
he
can
prove
that
by
bringing
forward
witnesses
who
were
present
as
well
as
himself
and
therefore
establish
the
fact
beyond
a
very
strong
i
confess
but
how
is
it
my
good
chewkle
that
this
man
what
is
his
name
mind
his
name
sir
said
chewkle
vexed
with
himself
to
find
he
had
let
it
slip
out
stupid
in
me
to
forget
his
name
said
nathan
gomer
tapping
his
forehead
no
matter
how
is
it
that
this
man
does
not
himself
come
forward
he
must
be
well
aware
that
in
helping
wilton
to
obtain
his
rights
he
would
be
securing
his
own
eh
chewkle
how
do
you
explain
that
a
secret
i
can
not
tell
without
putting
you
in
the
same
position
as
myself
and
then
you
know
my
claim
for
giving
you
the
information
be
worth
much
and
i
want
a
stiff
sum
i
do
responded
chewkle
with
a
marked
emphasis
upon
the
last
sentence
suppose
i
may
ask
how
you
came
to
find
this
man
out
and
how
you
obtained
from
him
the
information
you
have
already
given
to
me
asked
gomer
regarding
him
with
a
penetrating
glance
said
chewkle
assuming
an
indifferent
tone
although
he
was
aware
he
was
treading
on
delicate
ground
employed
the
man
to
carry
some
messages
for
me
and
other
little
matters
and
one
day
i
treated
him
to
some
beer
over
the
drink
he
repeated
some
of
the
things
as
had
occurred
to
him
years
ago
while
he
was
talking
i
found
the
circumstances
he
related
tallied
with
what
grahame
and
old
wilton
wanted
to
clear
up
and
then
i
went
quickly
to
work
and
sucked
him
as
dry
as
a
pump
given
last
hinted
to
him
of
course
that
what
he
was
telling
to
you
might
turn
out
of
value
to
both
suggested
gomer
a
word
returned
chewkle
with
a
wink
no
if
put
him
up
to
that
i
might
have
for
my
share
of
the
the
supplied
gomer
with
a
grin
chewkle
grinned
too
that
he
said
the
price
of
producing
the
man
and
giving
a
large
fortune
to
he
remains
still
in
ignorance
of
the
service
he
might
be
to
wilton
said
gomer
as
if
thoughtfully
that
very
strange
when
you
remembers
that
father
and
mother
were
married
in
disguised
names
said
chewkle
nathan
gomer
felt
greatly
disposed
to
give
way
to
a
whistle
but
he
restrained
his
feelings
and
though
he
felt
astonished
he
looked
composed
after
a
reflection
he
said
to
chewkle
can
you
produce
what
did
you
say
his
name
was
flurry
yourself
about
his
name
returned
chewkle
the
man
you
want
let
me
see
thursday
friday
saturday
in
ten
days
from
this
i
can
do
can
will
i
am
well
paid
for
much
does
that
mean
open
your
mouth
exclaimed
nathan
with
a
grin
hun
two
a
a
thousand
pounds
cried
chewkle
with
a
sudden
bound
from
the
sum
he
purposed
at
first
asking
worth
it
i
should
say
returned
nathan
gomer
with
a
contortion
which
was
something
between
a
yawn
and
a
horrifying
convulsion
there
is
consent
to
be
obtained
to
the
payment
of
this
large
sum
he
added
the
terms
upon
which
it
is
to
be
paid
to
be
i
admits
returned
chewkle
with
a
cunning
leer
i
must
have
something
in
hand
you
know
before
i
goes
from
here
a
farthing
returned
nathan
gomer
coolly
i
shall
not
be
a
shilling
the
richer
nor
a
the
poorer
whether
the
man
is
produced
or
kept
perdu
all
you
have
been
telling
me
may
be
lies
you
know
my
chewkle
i
mean
to
insinuate
that
such
is
the
case
but
when
one
is
called
to
pay
down
for
bare
assertion
then
it
is
necessary
to
be
told
you
truth
sir
replied
chewkle
with
earnestness
and
then
thoughtlessly
as
the
forged
deed
flashed
through
his
mind
he
said
i
could
tell
you
some
information
about
grahame
as
like
to
you
said
nathan
gomer
coolly
have
lent
him
a
heap
of
money
you
inquired
chewkle
with
a
tone
as
much
as
to
say
know
you
am
well
secured
said
gomer
apathetically
therefore
chewkle
it
is
of
no
use
your
trying
it
on
with
me
in
that
it
sure
that
grahame
has
borrowed
money
many
a
prouder
man
than
he
has
done
the
same
thing
but
he
has
given
security
for
it
there
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
routine
of
worldly
circumstances
in
that
he
may
be
in
difficulties
now
perhaps
he
is
he
he
might
be
there
is
nothing
however
that
grahame
has
done
or
is
likely
to
do
but
what
would
be
strictly
honorable
and
therefore
nothing
you
can
say
about
him
can
affect
wilton
wrong
i
could
tell
you
a
trifle
about
a
forged
deed
as
would
uncurl
your
and
make
it
quiver
like
that
of
a
cat
if
i
what
could
you
tell
me
all
what
that
question
restored
chewkle
to
his
equilibrium
which
nathan
taunts
were
fast
pulling
him
out
of
he
bit
his
lips
and
mentally
called
himself
a
fool
of
great
magnitude
for
having
permitted
himself
to
be
so
far
drawn
out
so
to
prevent
further
trips
of
speech
he
rose
up
and
prepared
to
go
you
will
not
give
me
anything
down
gomer
he
said
off
i
come
agen
it
be
worth
my
you
would
like
to
go
to
wilton
and
see
him
you
can
ask
him
if
he
will
put
down
the
large
sum
you
ask
upon
the
mere
faith
of
your
promise
to
produce
the
man
of
whom
you
have
spoken
the
proposition
is
so
very
chewkle
thought
for
a
moment
then
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
face
of
nathan
inquiringly
and
said
then
is
your
idea
of
that
matter
to
be
fair
between
man
and
man
proposition
is
this
replied
gomer
have
no
objection
to
give
you
a
sovereign
now
and
to
meet
you
morning
at
nine
and
then
either
give
you
a
further
sum
and
enter
into
an
agreement
with
you
or
tell
you
that
i
intend
to
take
no
further
steps
in
the
chewkle
reflected
for
an
instant
he
should
be
sure
of
a
pound
at
least
perhaps
he
might
get
more
the
offer
appeared
also
too
reasonable
if
he
wished
it
to
be
thought
he
intended
to
act
honestly
to
refuse
so
he
intimated
his
readiness
to
consent
to
it
and
nathan
gave
to
him
a
sovereign
saying
to
him
must
meet
me
exactly
at
nine
morning
at
the
paddington
station
of
the
great
western
railway
i
will
see
you
at
that
hour
or
as
shortly
after
as
possible
in
the
for
if
i
decide
upon
purchasing
your
information
i
shall
proceed
immediately
afterwards
direct
to
harleydale
manor
to
wilton
said
chewkle
quietly
tell
you
i
produce
the
man
for
ten
true
but
you
will
want
the
money
you
ask
and
i
must
obtain
the
authority
to
give
it
you
you
understand
right
replied
chewkle
punctual
good
night
exclaimed
nathan
gomer
and
laying
hold
of
a
button
of
coat
he
led
him
to
the
outer
door
nodded
and
grinned
at
him
with
so
elfish
an
expression
that
chewkle
was
really
glad
to
get
away
he
saw
nathan
close
his
outer
door
and
heard
him
lock
it
he
heard
him
double
lock
and
bolt
the
inner
door
and
then
he
groped
his
way
down
into
the
street
a
queer
little
imp
of
old
he
muttered
to
himself
then
he
chuckled
done
him
i
think
he
said
shall
have
that
money
and
he
may
hook
for
the
evidence
for
i
shall
be
off
for
a
little
while
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
likewise
in
the
neighbourhood
of
harleydale
but
not
for
the
benefit
of
old
health
i
think
rapidly
improve
after
i
down
about
his
he
turned
into
the
and
so
on
into
a
crowded
thoroughfare
in
the
meantime
nathan
gomer
on
returning
to
his
easy
chair
drew
up
his
knees
to
his
chin
and
went
through
some
extraordinary
evolutions
he
rubbed
his
yellow
hands
with
delight
and
his
golden
visage
glistened
and
beamed
with
felicity
chewkle
he
cried
cunning
chewkle
ho
ho
ho
such
a
cunning
fellow
josh
maybee
is
the
man
eh
confined
in
spike
hotel
which
is
the
prison
i
will
be
closeted
with
him
while
chewkle
is
admiring
the
carpetbags
and
longing
to
secure
the
heaviest
in
the
of
the
railway
having
settled
my
business
with
maybee
i
shall
turn
my
attention
to
the
forged
deed
executed
i
suppose
by
grahame
and
stolen
i
suspect
by
chewkle
ay
on
that
very
morning
i
watched
him
to
and
from
his
lodgings
and
the
chambers
of
solicitors
it
will
come
right
at
last
all
come
right
at
last
flora
from
your
bright
abode
in
heaven
your
gentle
eyes
may
witness
that
i
have
striven
truly
and
honestly
to
keep
the
solemn
vow
i
have
made
and
though
on
earth
you
regarded
me
with
emotions
of
distaste
or
sad
compassionateness
only
you
may
bend
on
me
a
smile
of
tenderness
denied
to
me
on
earth
alas
alas
he
placed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
with
a
strange
shivering
convulsion
of
the
frame
sobbed
aloud
chapter
lester
vane
and
vivian
take
back
the
foul
reproach
railer
nor
urge
my
rage
too
far
lest
thou
find
i
have
as
daring
spirit
in
my
blood
as
thou
or
any
of
thy
race
boasted
and
though
no
gaudy
titles
my
birth
yet
heaven
that
made
me
honest
made
me
more
than
ever
king
did
when
he
made
a
lord
insolent
villain
rowe
the
passionate
embrace
which
had
followed
flora
adjuration
to
harry
vivian
not
to
leave
england
was
but
the
prelude
to
fervent
acknowledgments
of
mutual
love
hal
had
quickly
come
to
a
sense
of
what
constituted
his
predilection
for
flora
he
admired
her
beauty
her
sweetness
of
manner
and
amiability
of
disposition
these
emotions
concentrated
produced
within
him
a
species
of
devotional
reverence
flora
on
the
contrary
loved
him
without
being
conscious
of
more
than
this
she
was
fully
sensible
of
his
handsome
personal
qualifications
she
was
attached
to
him
by
ties
of
gratitude
of
the
strongest
nature
for
had
he
not
saved
her
life
she
was
instinctively
pleased
flattered
gratified
by
his
subdued
and
almost
reverential
manner
towards
her
by
the
unfailing
homage
of
his
clear
beaming
eyes
in
truth
by
all
those
small
silent
attentions
and
that
gentle
deference
which
are
so
grateful
to
the
heart
of
woman
it
has
been
said
that
a
woman
can
not
even
to
herself
explain
why
she
loves
the
being
to
whom
she
yields
her
heart
it
is
not
alone
by
qualities
of
person
or
of
mind
she
is
won
but
there
is
a
charm
that
fascinates
and
enthralls
her
which
silently
defies
description
and
will
not
submit
to
analysis
this
charm
flora
discovered
in
harry
vivian
without
knowing
truly
what
was
its
real
effects
upon
her
it
elevated
him
into
the
first
place
in
her
estimation
so
gradually
and
naturally
that
she
did
not
detect
the
truth
although
she
found
herself
almost
constantly
thinking
of
him
dreaming
of
him
wishing
that
he
would
come
again
to
see
her
even
as
soon
as
he
had
departed
but
when
she
met
him
in
the
glen
in
harleydale
park
saw
his
saddened
countenance
listened
to
his
confession
of
love
and
heard
his
expressed
determination
of
parting
with
her
for
ever
then
she
awakened
to
a
sense
of
the
state
of
her
heart
then
she
saw
that
he
was
essential
to
her
happiness
and
that
if
he
went
abroad
to
return
no
more
to
her
her
future
life
would
be
one
of
blank
hopeless
desolation
she
found
now
that
she
loved
him
fondly
and
dearly
and
as
she
clung
to
him
she
revealed
with
words
broken
by
sobs
the
truth
to
him
and
extorted
from
him
a
promise
that
he
would
change
his
resolve
now
that
he
knew
her
heart
was
irrevocably
his
some
hours
passed
in
fond
communings
up
to
this
moment
their
relation
to
each
other
had
while
essentially
friendly
not
been
of
a
confiding
character
it
was
so
now
the
time
however
came
when
they
must
part
and
they
did
so
with
mutual
expressions
of
tenderness
but
with
the
understanding
that
for
the
present
their
attachment
should
be
kept
as
a
secret
between
them
and
remain
such
until
a
favourable
moment
presented
itself
for
an
avowal
it
was
also
arranged
that
no
mention
should
be
made
by
either
of
their
present
meeting
but
that
hal
should
return
to
the
inn
at
which
he
had
put
up
and
that
he
should
pay
his
visit
to
the
manor
house
as
though
he
had
arrived
from
london
on
a
visit
having
taken
advantage
of
the
general
invitation
he
had
received
from
her
father
to
come
to
his
house
when
he
would
with
the
certainty
of
always
receiving
a
warm
welcome
they
separated
flora
with
a
light
step
and
a
strange
buoyancy
of
spirit
hastened
towards
the
house
and
after
allowing
her
as
he
believed
time
to
regain
it
hal
left
the
sequestered
glen
for
evermore
a
dear
spot
in
his
memory
and
struck
off
by
a
through
the
wood
to
the
inn
at
which
he
had
stopped
on
his
arrival
during
the
shooting
lester
vane
and
colonel
mires
accidentally
became
separated
the
former
was
an
ardent
sportsman
and
in
the
excitement
of
excellent
sport
he
followed
up
his
game
with
more
celerity
and
eagerness
than
the
colonel
whose
long
residence
in
india
had
grafted
upon
him
habits
of
indolence
which
he
felt
little
disposition
to
change
when
the
latter
found
that
he
was
left
alone
for
he
had
seated
himself
beneath
the
branches
of
an
oak
to
rest
for
a
short
time
abruptly
occurred
to
him
that
lester
vane
had
a
motive
in
being
so
violently
active
and
that
he
purposed
distancing
him
with
the
object
of
having
somewhere
a
with
flora
the
fact
was
that
his
mind
always
dwelling
upon
her
and
being
apprehensively
jealous
of
the
power
of
others
to
win
her
favour
to
his
disadvantage
he
construed
circumstances
in
many
instances
falsely
and
absurdly
so
as
to
square
with
his
prevailing
impression
determined
therefore
not
to
be
jockeyed
by
vane
he
wended
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
manor
house
taking
a
somewhat
circuitous
route
not
heeding
the
occasional
though
distant
reports
of
lester
gun
in
the
opposite
direction
because
eaten
up
by
his
jealous
suspicions
he
regarded
the
continued
discharges
as
a
mere
blind
and
believed
them
to
be
kept
up
by
the
gamekeeper
under
the
instructions
of
vane
purposely
to
deceive
him
sick
restless
with
inflamed
thoughts
he
pursued
his
course
until
he
found
himself
emerge
into
the
open
park
as
he
did
so
he
perceived
flora
emerge
by
a
narrow
path
between
two
hills
forming
a
small
natural
gorge
from
the
glen
where
she
had
met
hal
he
watched
her
proceed
to
the
manor
house
which
was
in
view
he
noted
the
elastic
step
with
which
she
hastened
on
and
he
felt
a
painful
burning
emotion
of
wonder
as
to
why
her
bearing
should
have
in
so
brief
a
period
undergone
a
change
at
once
evident
and
to
him
remarkable
he
had
not
long
to
wait
in
wonder
her
form
was
scarcely
lost
among
the
shrubs
and
trees
with
which
the
gardens
were
profusely
adorned
when
his
eyes
suddenly
lighted
upon
the
form
of
young
vivian
emerging
from
the
same
gorge
which
flora
had
so
recently
left
hal
made
unconsciously
direct
to
the
spot
where
the
colonel
was
standing
but
desirous
of
not
being
observed
by
him
the
latter
instantly
retreated
and
concealed
himself
in
a
small
brake
until
the
object
of
his
curiosity
and
wonder
passed
the
distance
which
divided
them
prevented
his
recognising
at
first
the
person
of
the
stranger
who
he
felt
convinced
had
just
terminated
an
interview
with
flora
alone
and
in
a
solitary
spot
he
trembled
with
rage
and
agony
his
lips
became
parched
his
hands
and
forehead
burned
as
he
concluded
it
must
be
vane
and
he
resolved
upon
his
arrival
near
where
he
lay
concealed
to
advance
and
tax
him
at
any
risk
of
consequences
with
the
ungentlemanly
duplicity
of
which
he
believed
he
had
been
guilty
what
however
was
his
astonishment
and
fury
when
he
found
that
harry
vivian
was
the
hero
of
the
interview
the
stranger
who
had
infused
into
manner
that
apparent
happiness
in
which
of
late
especially
it
had
been
so
deficient
his
first
impulse
was
to
rush
from
his
covert
fasten
upon
him
and
strangle
him
but
the
physical
proportions
of
hal
were
such
as
to
compel
him
to
reflect
in
spite
of
his
intense
vindictiveness
upon
the
prospect
of
success
in
such
a
step
to
be
himself
overpowered
and
fail
would
be
destruction
to
his
hopes
and
he
paused
to
rack
his
brain
for
the
best
course
for
him
to
adopt
but
harry
vivian
was
light
of
heart
and
of
step
too
and
he
was
abreast
of
mires
and
had
disappeared
in
the
recesses
of
the
wood
before
the
latter
had
decided
upon
what
step
he
should
take
nothing
was
left
for
him
but
to
retrace
his
steps
with
the
endeavour
of
meeting
lester
vane
as
he
returned
from
his
sport
he
threw
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
moved
away
with
a
shadow
of
gloom
settled
upon
his
features
he
muttered
to
have
thought
of
my
gun
a
stiff
charge
in
both
barrels
would
have
more
than
sufficed
to
have
dealt
him
his
fate
and
who
would
have
suspected
me
he
cast
his
eyes
rapidly
in
the
direction
hal
had
taken
but
no
sign
of
him
was
visible
not
even
his
receding
footstep
could
be
heard
in
the
solemn
stillness
he
failed
to
meet
lester
vane
in
the
wood
and
when
they
encountered
at
dinner
he
saw
that
the
latter
treated
him
coldly
and
with
suspicious
distrust
as
usual
old
wilton
engaged
him
in
conversation
leaving
lester
the
opportunity
of
paying
undivided
attention
to
flora
with
glaring
eyes
he
watched
every
movement
of
both
he
perceived
that
his
rival
was
actuated
by
no
common
motive
to
gain
the
favourable
opinion
of
flora
and
he
observed
that
she
seemed
abstracted
and
inattentive
though
her
cheek
was
blooming
like
a
rose
and
her
eye
shining
like
a
star
but
for
the
circumstance
he
had
witnessed
that
morning
he
would
have
believed
that
the
low
earnest
words
and
the
deep
fervent
gaze
of
lester
vane
had
occasioned
her
heightened
colour
and
the
brilliancy
of
her
eye
now
he
was
convinced
that
her
secret
interview
with
young
vivian
was
the
cause
and
he
cursed
him
bitterly
in
his
heart
flora
pleading
a
headache
retired
early
and
colonel
mires
feeling
that
conversation
after
she
had
gone
would
be
insupportable
alleged
fatigue
as
an
excuse
to
seek
his
room
leaving
lester
vane
and
old
wilton
alone
the
colonel
was
too
excited
to
remain
in
his
room
and
he
walked
upon
the
terrace
gazing
up
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
sleeping
apartments
imagining
that
in
which
flora
would
repose
and
groaning
in
spirit
as
he
thought
that
he
would
not
be
the
chosen
object
of
her
thoughts
and
prayers
ere
she
sank
into
the
fairy
land
of
dreams
once
or
twice
he
fancied
that
a
shadow
flitted
past
him
although
at
some
little
distance
and
suddenly
remembering
the
incident
in
park
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
same
watcher
at
window
there
might
be
here
upon
the
same
errand
he
darted
into
the
deep
shadow
of
a
buttress
upon
the
terrace
and
crouching
glided
like
a
panther
stealing
after
his
prey
up
to
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
the
object
disappear
he
always
carried
a
brace
of
small
pocket
pistols
with
him
it
had
been
his
custom
in
india
when
stationed
among
the
hill
tribes
and
he
did
so
in
england
he
had
never
hesitated
to
shoot
one
of
the
natives
even
upon
a
trifling
pretext
he
would
not
have
hesitated
much
to
do
a
similar
thing
in
england
but
that
the
law
is
inconveniently
sensitive
upon
that
point
now
he
seemed
to
feel
himself
justified
in
using
the
deadly
weapon
because
it
would
be
discharged
at
some
prowler
seeking
plunder
such
at
least
was
the
reason
he
should
offer
for
his
murderous
act
that
he
arranged
with
himself
he
drew
from
his
breast
pocket
a
pistol
and
upon
observing
a
man
wrapped
in
a
loose
cloak
silently
approach
from
the
precincts
of
a
turreted
wing
of
the
mansion
he
felt
convinced
though
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
features
that
he
knew
the
stranger
he
raised
his
pistol
and
took
a
careful
aim
but
himself
and
purpose
were
detected
and
the
stranger
sprang
hastily
forward
towards
him
mires
pulled
the
trigger
a
flash
of
light
and
a
report
followed
at
the
same
instant
he
felt
a
heavy
blow
strike
him
upon
the
temple
which
hurled
him
over
the
balustrade
that
edged
the
terrace
and
he
fell
among
the
flowers
beneath
on
to
the
soft
earth
and
lay
there
stunned
when
he
recovered
the
servants
were
closing
up
the
house
with
a
brain
racking
and
splitting
he
rose
up
his
hand
yet
grasped
the
pistol
his
finger
still
curled
round
the
trigger
had
he
slain
the
man
at
whom
he
had
fired
he
gazed
around
him
and
listened
there
was
no
trace
of
excitement
either
within
or
without
the
building
no
sign
that
the
discharge
of
the
pistol
had
been
heard
or
the
short
violent
struggle
between
himself
and
the
stranger
witnessed
he
shook
himself
and
hastily
brushed
the
evidences
of
his
fall
from
his
attire
he
slowly
ascended
the
steps
of
the
terrace
feeling
cold
and
shivering
while
his
limbs
ached
as
though
he
had
been
beaten
all
over
he
threw
a
glance
at
the
spot
where
he
had
fired
at
the
stranger
but
failed
to
perceive
a
prostrate
human
body
although
he
could
not
believe
that
he
had
missed
his
aim
he
entered
the
house
and
then
retired
to
his
room
to
pass
the
night
in
profitless
speculation
and
mystified
wonder
that
he
had
encountered
young
vivian
he
felt
convinced
but
so
far
as
he
knew
only
to
his
own
discomfiture
beyond
all
was
a
chaos
of
doubt
presumption
and
ardent
but
malicious
wishes
in
the
morning
he
met
at
breakfast
wilton
flora
and
lester
vane
but
not
a
word
transpired
in
allusion
to
the
event
of
the
preceding
night
flora
seemed
cheerful
and
expectant
she
frequently
gazed
out
of
the
window
into
the
park
with
what
object
mires
very
shrewdly
guessed
and
it
was
evident
both
to
him
and
to
vane
that
the
animation
she
had
displayed
on
the
preceding
evening
was
maintained
lester
vane
was
cold
to
mires
but
more
than
ever
devoted
in
his
manner
to
flora
who
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
his
profound
attention
her
thoughts
being
engrossed
by
a
subject
far
more
pleasing
to
her
while
the
colonel
with
a
heart
gnawed
by
emotions
of
envy
and
jealousy
was
regarding
the
only
too
tender
politeness
of
vane
a
servant
entered
with
a
letter
addressed
to
wilton
the
old
gentleman
opened
it
and
after
running
his
eye
hastily
over
its
contents
he
handed
it
to
flora
is
from
young
vivian
he
said
is
in
the
neighbourhood
and
will
be
here
this
morning
on
a
short
visit
he
shall
be
welcome
very
welcome
i
shall
be
most
glad
to
see
him
for
irrespective
of
the
great
obligation
i
owe
to
him
i
like
the
youth
himself
to
his
manly
spirit
is
allied
considerable
genius
and
ability
he
possesses
rare
skill
in
his
art
and
is
modest
withal
a
true
sign
that
he
is
no
mere
both
mires
and
vane
bent
their
eyes
upon
flora
to
watch
the
effect
this
announcement
would
have
upon
her
and
to
observe
the
expression
of
her
beautiful
features
as
she
perused
the
note
placed
in
her
hands
their
scrutiny
was
the
reverse
of
they
saw
a
roseate
glow
spring
into
her
cheeks
and
mount
to
her
fair
white
brow
they
observed
with
disturbed
feelings
the
glitter
of
her
eye
and
the
soft
smile
that
gently
curled
her
short
upper
lip
mires
with
wrathful
vindictiveness
interpreted
the
play
of
her
features
and
lester
vane
did
so
too
but
in
vexed
wonder
is
this
person
the
latter
mentally
asked
himself
possesses
evidently
a
high
place
in
miss
good
opinion
in
what
relation
does
he
stand
to
her
what
are
his
claims
upon
her
favour
he
at
once
with
considerable
artifice
addressed
himself
to
the
task
of
ascertaining
and
soon
learned
from
lips
and
from
expressive
countenance
all
and
more
than
he
desired
to
know
rival
he
thought
and
smiled
contemptuously
scarcely
imagine
he
excels
me
in
personal
qualifications
he
mused
on
all
other
points
i
have
him
at
an
enormous
advantage
i
will
crush
his
pretensions
if
he
have
any
at
harry
vivian
was
not
long
behind
his
note
he
was
greeted
in
a
warm
friendly
manner
by
old
wilton
and
by
flora
with
a
quiet
earnestness
which
could
not
fail
to
impress
as
it
was
intended
those
who
witnessed
it
with
a
sense
of
the
estimation
in
which
she
held
him
and
it
did
its
work
with
surprise
and
anger
she
observed
that
colonel
mires
on
wilton
presenting
his
new
guest
to
him
threw
up
his
head
in
a
manner
purposely
and
offensively
insolent
and
that
lester
vane
drew
himself
up
haughtily
and
scarcely
moved
at
the
introduction
she
saw
the
quick
flash
of
eyes
and
the
scarlet
flush
which
spread
itself
like
a
band
across
his
forehead
impulsively
she
moved
towards
him
to
remove
as
far
as
possible
by
her
own
marked
attention
the
wound
her
guests
had
inflicted
upon
him
by
their
contemptuous
mode
of
receiving
him
but
her
father
who
did
not
appear
to
have
noticed
the
behaviour
of
either
of
her
guests
caught
her
by
the
hand
my
darling
he
said
will
avail
myself
of
your
arm
to
assist
me
to
my
library
this
morning
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
and
as
our
friends
know
each
other
now
they
will
excuse
our
short
absence
and
find
amusement
in
the
pleasure
of
their
own
society
until
our
with
the
air
of
a
patrician
he
waved
his
hand
to
his
guests
and
turned
to
leave
the
room
on
reaching
the
threshold
of
the
door
flora
looked
back
to
hal
for
she
felt
grieved
after
what
she
had
witnessed
to
leave
him
in
a
position
which
must
necessarily
be
embarrassing
to
him
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
her
and
it
seemed
to
her
with
a
saddened
expression
in
them
she
gently
disengaged
her
arm
from
her
grip
and
said
moment
dear
father
i
will
follow
she
returned
to
the
room
and
he
proceeded
towards
the
library
she
hastened
towards
hal
with
a
smiling
countenance
she
laid
her
white
hand
upon
his
arm
and
whispered
in
his
ear
he
smiled
and
pressed
her
hands
in
evident
gratefulness
and
she
quitted
the
room
looking
back
upon
him
to
the
last
not
a
glance
or
motion
did
she
vouchsafe
to
vane
or
to
mires
for
she
with
swelling
bosom
seemed
to
feel
that
the
insult
directed
at
harry
vivian
was
levelled
at
her
also
and
she
resented
it
accordingly
of
course
this
was
not
so
construed
by
either
of
the
suitors
nor
did
they
seem
to
read
her
interpretation
of
their
conduct
in
her
bearing
towards
themselves
they
only
saw
in
it
a
confirmation
of
their
fears
that
she
had
by
far
too
strong
a
predilection
for
the
youth
whose
society
they
had
somewhat
unexpectedly
been
called
upon
to
enjoy
she
was
gone
and
hal
was
left
alone
with
the
pair
colonel
mires
cast
a
hurried
glance
at
him
there
was
no
sign
of
the
last
encounter
upon
his
person
or
in
his
manner
he
doubted
therefore
if
he
could
have
been
the
man
he
had
seen
and
fired
at
but
if
not
who
could
it
have
been
that
was
a
question
to
be
settled
hereafter
he
caught
bright
eye
fixed
upon
him
and
he
tried
with
gloomy
knitted
brows
to
frown
it
down
but
as
it
never
wavered
in
its
settled
gaze
he
deliberately
turned
his
back
upon
him
and
with
a
formal
salute
to
lester
vane
he
strode
out
of
the
room
the
latter
was
thus
left
alone
with
harry
vivian
he
looked
steadfastly
and
scrutinisingly
at
him
from
head
to
foot
he
could
not
deny
to
himself
that
hal
was
eminently
handsome
and
that
he
was
dressed
fashionably
nay
elegantly
and
with
unexceptionable
taste
but
he
was
a
parvenu
a
creature
in
trade
only
just
out
of
his
apprenticeship
what
a
rival
lip
curled
as
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
he
even
laughed
and
aloud
it
was
a
mocking
laugh
and
grated
on
ear
most
harshly
his
impetuous
blood
surged
boilingly
through
his
veins
and
he
trembled
in
his
effort
to
appear
collected
and
calm
but
such
an
outward
aspect
he
felt
in
his
present
position
to
be
imperative
to
preserve
and
by
a
strong
effort
he
kept
his
inward
indignation
from
revealing
itself
after
his
sneering
laugh
vane
with
a
direct
and
insolent
stare
again
scanned
vivian
from
top
to
toe
as
he
smiled
he
twirled
the
points
of
his
moustache
between
his
fingers
and
thumb
and
then
turning
his
back
deliberately
upon
harry
vivian
walked
up
to
a
and
arranged
his
collar
harry
saw
now
that
he
was
the
object
of
deliberate
and
studied
insult
but
he
felt
that
it
would
not
be
advisable
to
create
a
scene
in
house
by
any
impetuous
or
violent
conduct
for
the
behaviour
of
colonel
mires
towards
him
he
could
make
allowance
but
this
man
had
no
such
excuse
in
vindication
of
his
position
as
a
young
honourable
man
he
resolved
not
to
submit
to
the
indignity
or
to
suffer
vane
to
part
from
him
in
the
belief
that
he
would
endure
contumelious
rudeness
without
resenting
he
advanced
towards
him
and
said
in
a
low
but
clear
firm
voice
vane
lester
vane
turned
slowly
round
and
stared
at
him
a
most
rude
offensive
stare
it
was
as
though
his
groom
had
suddenly
addressed
him
on
easy
and
familiar
terms
it
failed
to
add
anything
to
the
resentment
which
hal
felt
at
the
treatment
he
had
already
experienced
because
it
could
not
exceed
in
offence
the
previous
contumely
directed
at
him
but
he
proceeded
to
say
with
the
air
of
one
who
would
be
neither
put
down
nor
put
aside
lester
vane
we
meet
here
upon
an
equal
footing
that
is
as
guests
of
wilton
i
have
the
honour
of
being
received
by
him
and
miss
wilton
as
a
friend
let
us
therefore
understand
each
other
while
i
am
thus
received
by
them
i
claim
to
stand
in
the
same
position
as
any
of
their
guests
and
to
be
regarded
by
those
guests
as
holding
beneath
this
roof
no
meaner
station
here
sir
i
am
your
equal
and
i
request
you
to
distinctly
understand
that
i
will
not
calmly
endure
unprovoked
insult
from
you
or
any
individual
lester
vane
regarded
him
with
a
glance
of
scornful
contempt
and
replied
in
a
haughty
supercilious
tone
good
man
you
forget
yourself
and
presume
let
me
give
you
distinctly
to
understand
that
i
differ
with
you
in
your
view
of
the
laws
and
regulations
which
govern
the
position
of
visitors
in
this
or
any
house
wilton
is
undoubtedly
master
in
his
house
and
of
his
own
actions
but
i
am
no
less
the
master
of
mine
wilton
in
his
eccentricity
may
choose
to
invite
here
some
son
or
apprentice
it
is
immaterial
which
but
i
am
not
bound
to
entertain
violent
feelings
of
friendship
for
him
or
even
to
associate
with
him
what
is
more
i
do
not
choose
to
do
he
was
about
to
leave
the
room
but
hal
caught
him
by
the
wrist
he
said
me
you
can
not
go
this
vane
tried
to
fling
him
off
but
hal
held
him
as
if
he
were
in
a
vice
and
said
will
be
unadvisable
to
struggle
or
to
raise
your
voice
because
i
shall
then
consider
you
desire
to
make
the
household
a
witness
to
our
brief
discussion
and
i
shall
deem
you
coward
as
well
as
poltroon
now
sir
mark
me
i
repeat
it
in
this
house
i
stand
your
equal
out
of
it
your
superior
ay
sir
your
superior
you
may
be
as
the
son
of
a
poor
lord
an
honorable
without
deserving
even
that
appellative
for
honour
is
independent
of
condition
you
may
possess
a
at
which
the
officer
is
the
most
frequent
visitor
you
may
drive
a
carriage
obtained
upon
promise
of
payment
attended
by
a
groom
in
arrears
of
a
wages
you
may
move
in
fashionable
circles
attired
in
clothes
not
paid
for
or
display
at
times
money
wrung
by
hard
pleading
from
usurers
at
exorbitant
interest
you
may
do
worse
even
than
all
this
for
in
your
to
be
honourable
is
not
to
be
honest
but
no
item
of
that
foul
list
entitles
you
to
treat
me
with
scorn
or
to
reflect
upon
my
birth
or
position
nor
shall
it
i
will
not
permit
your
very
brassy
nobility
to
be
flashed
in
my
eyes
and
sounded
in
my
ears
as
pure
gold
i
know
the
ring
of
the
true
metal
too
well
for
that
if
i
am
a
i
scorn
to
do
a
dishonourable
action
and
therefore
i
may
justly
which
you
can
not
lay
a
claim
to
the
title
of
and
now
let
me
warn
you
that
as
i
hold
myself
to
be
in
all
particulars
upon
which
manhood
may
pride
itself
infinitely
your
superior
any
further
insult
tacit
or
direct
will
be
resented
by
me
in
such
manner
as
your
courage
or
your
cowardice
may
determine
now
he
flung
him
from
him
then
turning
his
back
he
walked
slowly
to
the
window
which
was
open
and
stepped
upon
the
terrace
strolling
with
a
calm
and
seemingly
imperturbed
manner
along
the
tesselated
pavement
lester
vane
was
livid
with
passion
he
was
obliged
to
wipe
the
froth
from
his
mouth
yet
by
no
outward
extravagance
of
manner
did
he
betray
the
emotions
seething
within
his
breast
his
first
impulse
was
to
follow
and
commit
some
act
of
violence
upon
his
aggressor
his
second
to
act
as
though
he
had
come
in
collision
with
some
low
vulgar
personage
as
soon
therefore
as
he
was
released
he
shook
his
wrist
apparently
to
remove
from
it
visible
marks
of
a
dirty
hand
he
smoothed
the
wrinkled
evidences
of
the
tight
grip
which
had
held
him
and
walked
to
the
to
arrange
his
attire
should
it
have
been
disarranged
in
the
little
passage
which
had
just
taken
place
he
was
acting
he
believed
the
eye
of
the
to
be
upon
him
it
was
not
the
performance
was
therefore
in
this
instance
thrown
away
the
glass
told
him
that
his
lips
were
parched
and
as
white
as
his
face
he
bit
them
sharply
to
redden
them
would
not
be
difficult
to
incite
that
fellow
to
go
out
with
me
he
muttered
could
put
a
bullet
in
his
heart
at
fourteen
paces
to
a
dead
he
paused
for
a
moment
reflectively
then
added
it
would
not
do
to
go
out
with
him
i
should
raise
him
insulting
vagabond
to
my
level
no
ruin
him
here
and
that
promptly
the
girl
is
mine
thank
the
stars
that
is
settled
it
is
very
clear
that
mires
bears
towards
him
a
mortal
hatred
together
we
will
get
up
a
little
plot
to
blast
him
in
the
favour
of
wilton
and
my
skill
in
exercising
an
influence
over
a
woman
is
mean
indeed
if
i
can
not
make
the
simple
pretty
flora
despise
him
hum
let
me
see
i
will
seek
out
mires
at
once
and
with
his
aid
fling
the
scoundrel
a
harder
than
ever
he
has
sustained
in
his
life
when
he
is
disposed
of
i
must
turn
my
attention
to
my
friend
mires
i
like
that
visage
i
like
his
scowl
i
must
be
careful
how
i
handle
him
but
as
for
my
friend
the
he
concluded
with
gnashing
teeth
shall
be
tossed
into
a
before
he
leaves
this
with
the
pretty
flora
as
a
spectator
looking
on
and
enjoying
the
he
cast
a
glance
towards
the
terrace
but
did
not
observe
the
object
of
his
spite
and
envy
he
then
quitted
the
room
and
proceeded
to
that
of
colonel
mires
where
a
servant
had
informed
him
that
he
would
find
him
he
tapped
lightly
at
the
door
and
entered
the
chamber
he
beheld
colonel
mires
leaning
forward
upon
the
edge
of
his
yet
in
such
a
mariner
as
to
avoid
observation
and
that
he
was
gazing
eagerly
down
upon
the
terrace
beneath
his
curiosity
being
aroused
he
moved
with
a
noiseless
step
to
shoulder
and
peered
over
it
the
attention
was
so
riveted
upon
some
object
that
he
did
not
perceive
his
unexpected
visitor
and
the
latter
beheld
on
the
terrace
young
vivian
who
appeared
to
be
somewhat
closely
examining
a
particular
spot
presently
he
stooped
down
picked
up
something
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
colonel
mires
uttered
an
oath
as
he
witnessed
the
act
and
the
next
moment
stepping
back
he
came
in
contact
with
vane
he
gazed
upon
him
fiercely
and
said
sir
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
strange
intrusion
upon
my
privacy
pardon
colonel
exclaimed
lester
vane
with
a
quiet
smile
and
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
wish
to
have
a
few
words
in
private
with
you
and
sought
you
with
that
purpose
i
knocked
at
your
door
and
imagined
that
i
heard
your
voice
bidding
me
enter
i
came
in
fact
to
confer
with
you
respecting
the
individual
who
has
this
morning
obtruded
himself
in
this
house
i
observed
that
you
did
not
welcome
him
with
any
indication
of
delight
and
as
i
regard
his
advent
as
an
infliction
and
a
nuisance
it
struck
me
that
together
we
might
rid
ourselves
and
the
house
of
a
common
enemy
by
some
little
arrangement
concerted
for
that
mires
listened
coldly
he
by
no
means
jumped
at
the
proposition
but
he
motioned
vane
to
be
seated
and
they
sat
down
to
confer
chapter
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
good
father
i
beseech
you
on
my
knees

me

word

early
at
home

in
company

or
sleeping

my
care

been
to

a
gentleman
of
princely
parentage

fair
demesnes

and
nobly
trained

my
soul

thee
is
there
no
pity
sitting
in
the
clouds
that
sees
into
the
bottom
of
my
grief
shakspere
wilton
did
not
observe
wherefore
his
daughter
quitted
his
arm
and
the
in
all
probability
if
he
had
seen
the
little
incident
which
followed
he
would
have
taken
no
notice
of
it
he
took
again
her
proffered
arm
and
together
they
entered
his
library
she
arranged
his
easy
chair
her
frequent
office
while
he
carefully
fastened
the
door
then
placing
a
chair
for
her
he
motioned
her
to
be
seated
she
obeyed
gazing
upon
him
with
an
expression
of
gradually
dawning
surprise
can
you
possibly
have
to
communicate
to
me
in
this
retired
private
manner
dear
sir
she
exclaimed
expecting
that
the
interview
would
result
in
the
information
that
he
had
some
present
to
make
her
a
pleasure
he
had
frequently
indulged
in
since
his
recent
accession
to
wealth
still
there
was
an
unusual
expression
in
his
air
and
manner
that
warranted
a
strange
and
uneasy
foreboding
that
it
would
prove
of
greater
importance
and
less
pleasure
than
a
mere
present
the
old
man
gave
a
loud
preparatory
hem
to
clear
his
voice
and
then
said
with
a
peculiar
earnestness
of
tone
my
sweet
one
during
the
struggling
years
of
poverty
to
which
we
were
together
doomed
neither
i
nor
your
sainted
mother
made
any
allusion
in
your
presence
or
in
that
of
your
brother
to
the
past
affluence
from
which
we
were
so
harshly
and
unexpectedly
thrust
nor
did
we
mention
at
any
time
the
names
of
those
with
whom
we
associated
or
with
whom
we
were
on
intimate
or
friendly
terms
but
there
were
many
some
are
dead
some
i
do
not
wish
to
renew
relations
with
others
i
may
shortly
invite
here
that
i
may
have
the
joy
of
seeing
the
old
hall
brightened
up
with
the
loved
faces
of
happier
times
to
come
however
to
the
point
and
purport
of
this
interview
i
must
tell
you
that
there
was
one
friend
to
whom
i
was
greatly
attached
he
was
the
playmate
of
my
childhood
the
school
companion
of
my
boyhood
and
my
friend
in
after
years
his
name
was
montague
vane
of
weardale
you
heard
me
i
think
on
meeting
with
the
honorable
lester
vane
in
london
name
him
in
terms
indicating
the
high
esteem
in
which
i
held
attention
began
to
be
riveted
and
her
wonder
at
the
coming
revelation
to
increase
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
she
merely
bowed
continued
wilton
friendship
was
so
and
unselfish
as
we
each
many
times
proved
it
to
he
that
we
determined
on
both
contracting
alliances
to
draw
that
friendship
yet
closer
by
cementing
if
providence
permitted
us
a
union
between
our
flora
felt
the
colour
stealing
from
her
cheeks
and
she
could
hear
the
beating
of
her
heart
she
watched
with
intense
eagerness
the
expression
her
features
wore
while
speaking
and
she
remained
wholly
silent
awaiting
what
was
yet
to
come
her
father
went
on
if
heaven
blessed
us
with
children
of
opposite
sex
we
made
a
solemn
compact
to
betroth
them
that
in
due
time
they
might
wed
each
flora
became
paler
than
marble
and
a
dizziness
seemed
to
take
possession
of
her
so
that
she
could
scarcely
preserve
her
equilibrium
her
father
did
not
observe
her
but
went
on
with
the
same
thoughtful
manner
as
before
denied
him
family
he
continued
flora
breathed
again
i
was
more
blessed
he
proceeded
were
born
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
wife
of
montague
vane
breathed
her
last
her
death
was
sudden
and
the
shock
to
my
friend
appeared
to
be
irrecoverable
our
compact
would
thus
have
fallen
through
but
that
he
urged
and
entreated
me
to
permit
him
to
nominate
the
son
of
his
elder
brother
lord
colborne
instead
of
the
child
he
had
hoped
would
have
handed
down
his
name
i
assented
and
each
solemnly
vowed
to
visit
with
our
lasting
displeasure
and
irreconcilable
hostility
either
of
the
children
attempting
to
frustrate
our
compact
by
wilful
and
obstinate
cruel
muttered
flora
overwhelmed
with
agony
at
what
had
just
been
communicated
to
her
still
her
father
had
not
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
to
observe
the
effect
this
startling
intelligence
would
naturally
have
but
continued
addressing
her
is
a
singular
coincidence
he
said
young
grahame
whose
father
by
the
way
has
written
to
propose
for
your
hand
for
his
son
ho
ho
i
have
declined
that
honour
i
say
it
is
singular
that
young
grahame
should
by
accident
introduce
to
me
and
to
you
the
son
of
lord
colborne
who
as
you
may
surmise
is
that
young
vane
to
whom
in
your
infancy
i
contracted
you
yet
more
singular
for
these
events
generally
turn
out
the
reverse
of
what
is
intended
or
desired
vane
declares
himself
most
strongly
and
passionately
attached
to
you
and
that
it
will
be
to
him
the
proudest
and
happiest
event
that
has
happened
or
can
happen
in
his
life
when
you
bestow
your
hand
upon
him
we
talked
the
matter
over
for
some
length
of
time
last
night
after
you
had
retired
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
the
ardour
of
his
affection
for
you
or
that
he
will
make
it
the
study
of
his
future
life
to
render
your
happiness
perfect
and
complete
he
will
be
a
lord
some
day
you
know
and
thus
the
humble
daughter
of
the
poor
old
gilder
will
be
lady
and
ride
her
barbary
courser
it
would
be
wholly
impossible
to
attempt
to
depict
the
horror
and
amazement
of
flora
on
receiving
this
announcement
of
the
disposal
of
her
hand
and
person
she
sat
utterly
aghast
the
dreams
of
the
previous
night
and
at
the
golden
dawn
were
at
one
blow
rudely
shattered
her
father
had
always
been
so
gentle
in
his
tenderness
to
her
so
mindful
of
her
wishes
and
inclinings
so
overjoyed
to
gratify
them
so
careful
not
to
thwart
them
that
though
a
strange
unbidden
impression
had
obtruded
itself
in
her
felicitous
daydreams
that
he
might
object
to
her
love
for
hal
vivian
yet
she
felt
that
he
was
so
devotedly
fond
of
her
he
would
not
be
able
to
withstand
her
fond
and
earnest
pleadings
in
favour
such
a
contingency
as
this
which
he
submitted
to
her
she
could
not
by
any
possibility
have
surmised
thought
was
absolutely
paralysed
she
knew
not
what
to
say
how
to
act
for
what
to
prepare
in
short
she
was
completely
confounded
bewildered
ready
to
die
with
fright
and
grief
even
now
wilton
had
not
raised
his
eyes
to
catch
the
expression
of
his
face
he
was
not
without
a
consciousness
that
he
was
exercising
a
stretch
of
parental
authority
beyond
its
just
limits
and
he
began
to
have
a
perception
that
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
him
if
he
were
to
feel
his
white
arms
entwining
his
neck
her
soft
lips
pressing
upon
his
forehead
as
they
uttered
in
a
low
whisper
her
assent
to
do
as
he
wished
her
but
she
made
no
sign
and
he
had
a
distinct
sense
that
she
did
not
sought
this
interview
with
you
my
darling
he
continued
with
a
slight
cough
i
thought
before
you
formed
for
yourself
an
attachment
you
should
know
my
position
and
your
own
in
respect
to
the
disposal
of
your
hand
also
because
the
young
man
to
whom
you
are
betrothed
is
in
the
house
and
because
further
he
is
urgent
to
plead
his
own
cause
to
do
which
of
course
i
have
granted
him
full
permission
you
must
expect
to
hear
from
his
lips
the
soft
language
of
affection
to
think
of
him
with
tenderness
and
always
to
remember
that
he
will
be
your
future
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
unhappy
girl
sobbing
hysterically
she
flung
herself
at
his
feet
and
clasped
his
knees
wilton
did
not
expect
this
display
he
had
been
surprised
at
her
silence
and
a
feeling
crept
over
him
that
she
did
not
receive
the
revelation
he
made
with
her
usual
deference
to
any
expression
of
his
will
but
he
did
not
look
for
a
weeping
suppliant
at
his
feet
he
started
back
and
cried
amazed
my
child
why
do
you
act
thus
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
affrighted
sorrow
me
in
mercy
spare
me
she
gasped
not
let
me
leave
you
pray
pray
do
not
urge
your
proposition
upon
me
foolish
girl
he
replied
soothingly
shall
not
separate
you
will
still
be
beneath
this
roof
with
me
oh
believe
me
i
stipulated
for
that
there
there
dry
your
tears
you
can
be
a
happy
wife
as
well
as
a
fond
no
no
she
exclaimed
with
shuddering
vehemence
can
not
i
can
not
i
dare
not
she
half
shrieked
not
echoed
her
father
elevating
his
eyebrows
with
wonder
almost
with
terror
words
are
a
mystery
to
me
your
conduct
inexplicable
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
can
not
oh
i
can
not
receive
addresses
she
exclaimed
almost
frantically
this
is
but
childish
absurdity
unless
you
have
some
grave
complaint
to
make
to
me
against
vane
said
her
father
with
a
slight
sternness
of
manner
he
done
aught
to
give
you
offence
she
replied
in
a
faint
tone
there
aught
in
his
appearance
or
manner
to
create
aversion
in
your
breast
he
inquired
is
not
that
she
returned
is
not
that
she
paused
is
it
inquired
her
father
flora
your
position
does
not
become
the
relation
in
which
we
stand
to
each
other
be
seated
be
composed
and
calm
tell
me
where
lies
your
objection
to
vane
she
rose
up
slowly
and
stood
before
her
father
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
throat
to
subdue
its
spasmodic
heavings
do
not
love
him
she
ejaculated
almost
inaudibly
can
well
believe
that
returned
her
father
gently
acquaintance
has
been
short
people
out
of
romances
and
in
the
actual
world
fall
in
love
with
each
other
the
instant
they
meet
it
takes
time
and
observation
besides
many
little
nameless
charms
to
raise
love
at
present
you
have
not
you
can
not
have
anything
to
say
against
the
personal
appearance
of
lester
vane
he
is
gentlemanly
in
his
manners
honourable
in
his
sentiments
and
in
his
disposition
amiable
and
kind
i
judge
so
from
what
i
have
seen
these
are
endearing
qualities
and
when
you
are
thrown
more
into
each
society
when
he
yet
more
softens
his
manner
in
his
wooing
and
consults
your
wishes
and
tastes
makes
your
will
his
and
shows
to
you
that
he
has
no
greater
earthly
bliss
than
that
afforded
him
in
seeing
you
happy
when
you
come
to
observe
this
and
to
appreciate
it
then
then
you
will
begin
to
love
cried
flora
emphatically
say
yes
responded
wilton
with
sharp
emphasis
water
wears
away
you
will
receive
him
on
probation
you
can
not
remain
to
many
and
constant
kindnesses
it
is
not
your
nature
to
do
so
and
when
you
find
yourself
growing
grateful
you
will
find
love
creeping
into
your
heart
to
keep
it
she
had
found
it
implore
you
sir
to
spare
me
from
an
ordeal
agonising
to
me
and
utterly
useless
and
hopeless
in
its
result
to
the
person
for
whom
it
is
appointed
she
rejoined
with
extreme
earnestness
never
can
love
not
cried
her
father
in
a
more
excited
tone
than
he
had
yet
used
and
now
regarding
the
expression
on
her
face
with
startled
wonder
he
had
never
before
seen
it
so
aroused
or
such
a
strange
gleam
flashing
from
her
eye
she
spoke
not
in
answer
to
this
question
not
i
ask
he
cried
loudly
and
harshly
see
by
your
manner
that
you
imply
a
motive
for
that
assertion
again
i
ask
you
why
not
she
struggled
passionately
with
her
emotions
she
wrung
her
hands
and
looked
about
her
almost
piteously
for
some
aid
or
help
by
which
she
might
escape
from
answering
this
question
he
thundered
animated
by
a
rage
she
had
never
yet
seen
him
display
it
seemed
gradually
to
change
her
to
stone
she
drew
herself
gently
up
crossed
her
hands
over
her
breast
closed
her
eyes
and
said
in
a
low
but
clear
firm
voice
love
already
another
wilton
who
in
his
excitement
had
risen
angrily
from
his
feet
now
staggered
back
and
sank
into
his
chair
like
one
smitten
with
paralysis
he
pressed
his
hands
over
his
forehead
upon
which
stood
large
drops
of
perspiration
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
and
cried
hoarsely
is
impossible
it
is
a
subterfuge
it
is
but
if
it
were
true
girl
i
have
years
years
ago
registered
a
i
she
exclaimed
hysterically
what
you
had
done
i
too
have
registered
a
vow
with
heaven
i
may
not
can
not
will
not
break
with
a
loud
sobbing
cry
she
ran
from
the
room
and
sought
her
own
plunged
into
a
deeper
grief
than
any
yet
known
by
her
although
she
had
suffered
much
she
saw
that
she
was
to
be
torn
from
hal
and
her
heart
clung
to
him
only
the
more
vehemently
now
she
knew
indeed
that
she
loved
him
now
she
experienced
in
its
fullest
force
how
entirely
he
was
enwoven
with
all
her
hopes
of
future
happiness
she
knew
it
too
at
the
moment
that
she
was
to
be
robbed
of
him
perhaps
for
ever
she
gave
way
to
the
wildest
emotions
of
sorrow
she
flung
herself
by
her
bedside
upon
her
knees
and
called
upon
god
to
help
her
in
her
distraction
she
pictured
lester
vane
approaching
her
stealing
his
arm
snakelike
about
her
waist
and
his
hot
breath
reeking
on
her
cheek
she
shuddered
and
shrieked
may
i
help
myself
she
gasped
how
how
oh
i
am
so
alone
so
alone
none
to
counsel
me
what
am
i
to
do
how
save
myself
from
this
fate
oh
hal
hal
had
you
but
let
me
perish
in
the
blistering
flames
i
shall
go
mad
i
shall
go
mad
she
sank
as
she
in
acute
agony
vehemently
ejaculated
these
words
prostrate
upon
the
floor
in
abject
despair
and
almost
senseless
wilton
remained
for
some
time
alone
in
his
library
overwhelmed
by
the
result
of
his
interview
with
his
daughter
a
project
he
had
nursed
for
years
even
in
his
destitution
and
especially
in
his
affluence
was
destroyed
from
the
quarter
in
which
he
least
expected
to
meet
with
opposition
he
was
foiled
too
by
an
event
upon
which
he
had
not
calculated
flora
in
love
with
whom
with
whom
ah
that
was
the
point
who
had
won
her
young
susceptible
heart
of
young
vivian
he
never
thought
it
was
but
the
other
day
he
was
a
mere
youth
his
figure
did
not
therefore
now
present
itself
to
his
inquiring
eyes
was
it
young
grahame
his
father
had
written
to
propose
the
match
but
where
had
they
met
then
too
he
was
vulgar
and
foolish
no
no
he
gave
taste
more
credit
who
was
there
else
no
one
save
mires
the
old
man
stopped
in
his
walk
he
have
taken
the
opportunity
of
being
my
guest
to
gain
her
simple
heart
he
muttered
with
a
fierce
and
angry
gesture
he
possibly
have
done
this
he
may
he
is
subtle
and
insinuating
if
he
has
he
shall
never
have
her
never
it
may
be
that
i
have
hit
the
truth
in
this
surmise
but
i
will
be
sure
i
will
question
him
and
from
his
own
lips
learn
the
he
rang
his
bell
violently
and
a
servant
answered
him
colonel
mires
he
said
sharply
to
him
that
when
he
is
at
liberty
i
should
be
glad
of
a
few
conversation
with
him
here
in
the
the
man
disappeared
with
a
bow
and
performed
his
errand
an
hour
probably
elapsed
during
which
wilton
was
eaten
up
with
anxiety
and
a
thousand
distracting
and
inexact
surmises
he
was
about
again
to
summon
his
servant
to
request
the
presence
of
his
guest
when
colonel
mires
made
his
appearance
wilton
made
a
sharp
and
curt
remark
upon
the
engagement
which
had
so
long
detained
him
from
complying
with
his
request
for
an
interview
but
he
expressed
his
gratification
that
it
had
not
wholly
prevented
him
from
presenting
himself
the
colonel
saw
that
something
had
happened
and
excused
himself
by
stating
that
the
servant
who
had
conveyed
to
him
the
message
had
given
him
no
intimation
that
wilton
desired
the
interview
to
be
immediate
it
is
calculated
to
have
a
material
influence
upon
my
future
peace
it
is
one
which
can
not
commence
too
early
nor
close
too
soon
wilton
exclaimed
as
he
motioned
colonel
mires
to
a
seat
which
he
accepted
wilton
then
proceeded
have
a
daughter
colonel
mires
almost
at
a
marriageable
colonel
face
flushed
crimson
as
bright
eye
met
his
he
only
bowed
however
wondering
what
this
observation
was
to
prelude
especially
as
he
could
see
that
the
old
man
was
trembling
with
strong
excitement
daughter
as
you
are
aware
colonel
mires
continued
wilton
my
favourite
child
the
gift
of
wedded
love
the
most
beautiful
among
her
sex
the
of
my
i
had
designed
a
certain
position
for
her
i
had
bound
myself
to
its
fulfilment
by
a
vow
i
have
through
the
greatest
trials
and
worst
vicissitudes
cherished
it
and
now
when
upon
the
verge
of
its
consummation
i
find
my
purpose
retarded
flung
back
by
an
event
as
unlooked
for
as
it
is
most
sir
indeed
mark
me
colonel
mires
i
am
fully
acquainted
with
my
temperament
her
inclinings
every
phase
of
her
gentle
disposition
i
am
fully
convinced
that
she
has
no
guile
would
not
cast
about
her
to
find
a
man
to
love
to
bestow
her
heart
upon
in
the
ultimate
hope
of
following
up
the
gift
with
that
of
her
hand
it
is
not
her
nature
she
must
be
wooed
to
be
i
believe
exclaimed
colonel
mires
with
some
little
emphasis
course
responded
wilton
let
me
inform
you
sir
if
you
know
it
not
already
she
has
been
wooed
sir
and
won
surreptitiously
wooed
and
stealthily
fraudulently
the
face
of
colonel
mires
changed
colour
like
a
chameleon
he
knitted
his
brows
and
bent
an
almost
fierce
gaze
upon
wilton
you
strong
reasons
sir
for
forming
this
strange
conclusion
he
inquired
colonel
rejoined
wilton
with
an
expressive
gesture
very
best
i
have
it
on
the
authority
of
the
lady
an
oath
escaped
the
lips
of
the
colonel
he
rose
and
paced
the
room
in
visible
agitation
when
he
had
somewhat
controlled
his
emotion
he
returned
to
his
seat
and
confronting
wilton
he
said
you
tell
me
sir
who
has
thus
acted
is
what
i
wish
to
know
exclaimed
wilton
striking
the
palm
of
his
hand
with
his
clenched
fist
lady
omitted
that
very
important
item
in
her
confession
i
sent
for
you
under
an
impression
that
you
were
the
very
man
who
could
supply
that
valuable
piece
of
colonel
mires
was
bursting
to
ask
for
the
circumstances
which
led
to
this
confession
on
the
part
of
flora
he
could
easily
understand
that
it
must
have
arisen
from
a
proposition
made
by
her
father
to
her
extremely
repugnant
to
her
feelings
he
had
an
instinctive
sense
that
he
was
not
the
object
of
her
choice
and
he
was
at
least
glad
that
flora
had
rejected
the
proposed
husband
whoever
he
might
be
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
at
the
same
time
to
form
a
shrewd
guess
at
the
person
flora
had
acknowledged
loving
from
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
wilton
was
at
present
he
foresaw
that
it
would
be
easy
to
ruin
the
successful
rival
in
estimation
at
once
and
as
he
believed
for
ever
he
therefore
instantly
resolved
to
attempt
it
you
formed
no
surmise
identifying
the
person
who
has
inveigled
your
affections
he
asked
replied
wilton
drily
i
ask
who
it
is
prefer
hearing
your
communication
first
responded
wilton
in
the
same
hard
manner
think
i
can
show
him
to
you
and
at
this
moment
exclaimed
mires
rising
am
afraid
that
i
expect
you
can
returned
wilton
growing
more
stern
severe
and
cold
in
his
manner
me
if
you
please
observed
mires
noticing
the
distant
manner
of
his
host
he
advanced
to
the
centre
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
terrace
beneath
he
motioned
to
wilton
to
gaze
below
he
pointed
out
hal
vivian
who
stood
in
an
attitude
of
melancholy
abstraction
his
gaze
seemingly
fixed
upon
the
beautiful
landscape
stretching
away
to
the
horizon
is
the
man
he
exclaimed
emphatically
wilton
gazed
upon
him
with
distended
orbs
and
then
gave
utterance
to
a
wild
laugh
of
incredulity
he
exclaimed
remarked
mires
it
yet
is
the
old
wilton
pressed
his
hands
to
his
temples
and
tried
to
look
back
upon
the
past
the
effort
helped
him
to
no
solution
of
the
enigma
that
his
daughter
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
apprentice
seemed
incredible
but
when
he
came
to
remember
that
he
had
saved
her
life
had
been
able
to
pay
her
many
most
acceptable
attentions
when
she
was
in
misery
and
distress
he
began
to
believe
that
there
might
be
something
in
it
after
all
he
staggered
rather
than
walked
to
his
seat
and
pressing
his
hands
again
over
his
brow
once
more
went
over
the
scenes
in
which
under
his
eye
they
had
taken
part
together
there
was
not
enough
to
satisfy
him
yet
that
the
assertion
could
be
true
he
turned
sharply
to
him
inform
me
colonel
he
said
you
came
to
alight
upon
this
discovery
the
colonel
shrugged
his
shoulders
had
a
shrewd
notion
of
it
from
the
first
he
returned
observed
his
conduct
when
visiting
you
at
the
park
i
detected
his
artful
duplicity
immediately
after
i
had
been
as
your
guest
called
upon
to
endure
his
company
i
noticed
his
obsequious
deference
to
you
his
readiness
to
coincide
with
your
views
and
to
assent
without
reflection
to
all
you
did
not
observe
that
remarked
wilton
thoughtfully
replied
colonel
mires
did
you
notice
his
marked
though
quiet
attentions
to
your
daughter
his
incessant
gaze
upon
her
eyes
when
she
was
present
his
subdued
yet
devoted
bearing
to
her
the
cunning
manner
in
which
he
turned
every
word
from
her
lips
into
an
acknowledgment
of
love
or
asked
for
grateful
remembrances
of
an
act
which
the
royal
conductor
would
have
done
much
better
and
have
expected
scarcely
scanty
thanks
for
the
able
performance
of
his
duty
you
did
not
observe
how
he
foisted
his
society
upon
her
at
every
turn
because
you
never
dreamed
that
he
would
be
guilty
of
such
presumption
any
more
than
you
could
have
any
conception
that
he
had
induced
her
to
consent
to
clandestine
meetings
or
of
the
number
of
such
interviews
which
have
taken
old
wilton
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
howl
of
wounded
rage
and
pride
mires
this
is
a
most
grave
charge
he
cried
with
foaming
lips
is
one
that
compromises
my
fair
fame
as
well
as
the
honour
of
young
vivian
of
whom
until
you
have
spoken
concerning
him
i
have
heard
nothing
but
what
redounds
to
his
colonel
mires
sneered
in
fact
he
said
have
been
prepared
for
your
ears
do
not
misapprehend
me
wilton
he
continued
hastily
have
no
intention
or
design
to
compromise
the
fair
fame
of
miss
wilton
she
is
too
pure
too
ingenuous
and
artless
for
any
charge
having
such
object
to
be
sustained
but
her
simple
guileless
nature
lays
her
open
to
the
designs
of
an
unprincipled
adventurer
who
by
adventitious
circumstances
has
obtained
some
influence
over
her
and
she
might
be
induced
to
consent
to
an
interview
artfully
suggested
and
ardently
pressed
without
having
in
her
simplicity
any
notion
that
her
assent
would
bear
a
construction
unfavourable
to
her
to
any
lady
acting
in
the
same
manner
under
similar
wilton
waved
his
hand
sternly
us
keep
to
facts
colonel
he
said
are
now
charging
upon
my
daughter
and
vivian
the
grave
impropriety
of
indulging
in
clandestine
interviews
are
you
prepared
with
proofs
can
speak
to
one
having
occurred
yesterday
replied
colonel
mires
echoed
wilton
are
mistaken
you
must
he
vivian
did
not
arrive
from
london
until
that
is
at
least
are
you
sure
of
what
you
assert
saw
him
in
your
park
yesterday
let
him
deny
it
if
he
mires
i
must
see
this
matter
to
the
end
i
will
send
for
vivian
this
moment
and
interrogate
him
and
in
your
you
will
returned
mires
coolly
wilton
rang
the
hell
sharply
and
when
the
servant
answered
the
summons
he
said
will
find
in
the
garden
my
guest
vivian
ask
him
to
attend
me
here
immediately
say
that
i
have
something
of
importance
to
confer
with
him
the
man
disappeared
and
in
a
few
minutes
young
vivian
was
ushered
into
the
library
he
started
on
seeing
colonel
mires
and
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
flushed
and
excited
countenance
of
old
wilton
the
scene
between
himself
and
flora
in
the
glen
on
the
day
preceding
flashed
across
his
mind
and
instantly
a
grim
foreshadowing
of
what
was
to
come
passed
like
a
gloomy
cloud
over
his
brain
manner
was
grave
cold
even
harsh
colonel
mires
met
him
with
an
insulting
but
triumphant
curl
of
the
lip
which
hal
retorted
with
a
glance
of
scorn
and
defiance
vivian
commenced
wilton
his
voice
trembling
in
his
eagerness
to
come
at
the
truth
am
given
to
understand
that
you
have
designs
upon
the
affections
of
my
daughter
miss
wilton
that
you
have
prosecuted
those
designs
with
secrecy
and
subtlety
and
by
mean
artifices
have
in
some
degree
succeeded
in
your
unworthy
purpose
wilton
sir
interrupted
hal
in
a
voice
which
startled
him
you
conscious
of
the
nature
of
the
words
you
are
addressing
to
me
mean
artifices
unworthy
purpose
this
is
bitter
language
sir
which
i
do
not
deserve
and
most
indignantly
repudiate
to
me
rejoined
wilton
with
an
imperious
manner
respect
responded
hal
at
the
same
time
i
must
insist
sir
in
addressing
me
you
do
not
employ
terms
derogatory
to
my
honour
colonel
mires
laughed
scornfully
hal
turned
fiercely
to
him
day
of
reckoning
is
to
come
he
exclaimed
is
unnecessary
for
you
to
add
to
your
then
again
turning
to
wilton
he
continued
presume
sir
that
i
have
been
brought
here
as
a
delinquent
placed
upon
his
trial
that
you
will
enact
the
parts
of
judge
and
jury
and
this
man
will
be
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
the
witness
and
will
offer
the
whole
of
the
evidence
be
it
so
proceed
with
your
charges
i
will
not
utter
one
word
until
you
have
both
finished
i
shall
then
reply
to
the
allegations
and
of
this
be
assured
sir
that
i
shall
not
now
any
more
than
i
have
ever
done
swerve
from
the
truth
be
the
consequences
what
they
may
to
hal
kept
his
promise
not
a
word
was
extorted
from
him
by
the
wild
suppositions
of
wilton
or
by
the
insults
the
taunts
or
the
base
insinuations
of
colonel
mires
but
at
last
when
wilton
called
upon
him
for
his
answer
he
had
discovered
that
although
flora
had
confessed
to
having
disposed
of
her
heart
she
had
not
stated
to
whom
that
all
that
had
been
produced
against
himself
were
the
suppositions
of
the
old
man
or
suggestions
of
the
bitter
enemy
before
him
even
the
accidental
interview
of
the
day
before
so
strongly
referred
to
rested
only
on
colonel
statement
of
having
seen
flora
and
himself
emerge
successively
from
the
glen
and
he
perceived
that
if
he
chose
to
keep
his
mouth
sealed
the
main
features
of
the
charge
would
hang
upon
the
veracity
of
the
colonel
respecting
which
it
was
certain
that
wilton
did
not
entertain
the
most
exalted
notions
he
however
resolved
to
free
flora
from
the
faintest
breath
of
imputation
and
to
acknowledge
just
so
much
with
regard
to
their
mutual
passion
as
the
turn
his
own
defence
and
explanations
might
eliminate
and
no
more
had
the
course
adopted
to
examine
him
been
what
it
ought
to
have
been
he
would
not
have
concealed
an
incident
as
it
was
he
determined
to
reserve
as
much
as
he
could
from
colonel
mires
at
least
before
however
he
could
speak
the
library
door
was
flung
open
and
the
servant
announced
in
a
loud
voice
mark
chapter
the
unpleasant
conference
you
are
charged
your
own
heart
may
inform
you
why
with
such
a
crime
as
give
it
utterance
and
then
meet
the
consequences
you
shall
do
so
unless
first
who
accuses
me
all
things
if
not
all
men
the
universal
rumour
my
own
presence
on
the
spot
the
place
the
time
and
every
speck
of
circumstance
unite
to
fix
the
blot
on
you
byron
chewkle
attired
as
a
traveller
about
to
undertake
a
long
journey
entered
the
of
the
great
western
railway
station
on
the
morning
following
his
interview
with
nathan
gomer
precisely
as
the
clock
pealed
the
hour
of
nine
he
gazed
about
him
inspected
with
unabashed
steadfastness
the
features
of
the
individuals
assembled
in
readiness
for
the
train
and
then
seated
himself
in
a
conspicuous
situation
he
arranged
his
hair
and
his
hat
he
looked
slowly
once
more
at
every
face
and
then
putting
the
knob
of
his
walking
stick
to
his
lips
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
a
heap
of
miscellaneous
luggage
he
commenced
to
wait
for
nathan
gomer
at
the
same
hour
nathan
presented
himself
at
the
gate
of
the
prison
and
in
his
turn
waited
for
admission
he
took
the
opportunity
of
obtaining
from
one
of
the
officers
the
some
particulars
respecting
joshua
maybee
and
immediately
the
opportunity
was
afforded
him
he
made
direct
for
that
apartment
on
the
county
side
of
the
prison
josh
maybee
was
not
afflicted
with
a
mania
for
early
rising
he
liked
to
take
out
a
large
share
of
existence
reclining
between
sheets
upon
a
mattress
he
would
have
preferred
a
down
bed
but
that
was
a
luxury
unknown
to
the
prison
at
least
on
the
county
side
he
therefore
went
to
bed
early
and
rose
late
he
was
miserably
poor
and
as
scarcely
anything
in
the
place
acknowledged
him
for
master
he
had
no
fear
of
being
robbed
consequently
he
slept
with
his
door
unlocked
it
saved
him
a
trouble
night
and
morning
nathan
gomer
therefore
entered
his
room
without
difficulty
and
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
he
gazed
upon
the
poor
mean
prison
bed
and
upon
the
pallid
old
face
lying
upon
the
pillow
the
eyes
closed
in
sleep
he
sighed
for
the
sallow
hue
of
the
features
and
the
long
lines
furrowing
forehead
and
cheek
told
of
long
incarceration
and
much
continued
mental
suffering
he
drew
towards
the
bed
with
a
noiseless
step
and
taking
off
his
hat
and
gloves
he
laid
them
aside
with
his
stick
he
then
seated
himself
upon
the
floor
by
the
bedside
placing
his
face
within
a
foot
of
so
that
when
the
latter
awoke
he
should
be
promptly
alive
to
the
fact
that
he
was
honoured
with
the
presence
of
a
visitor
without
pretending
to
assert
that
the
eyes
of
nathan
gomer
possessed
magnetic
influence
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
very
shortly
after
nathan
had
fixed
them
upon
joshua
sealed
orbs
the
latter
commenced
a
tremulous
vibration
and
ultimately
the
eyeballs
appeared
to
be
slowly
rotating
beneath
the
lids
increasing
their
motion
until
the
eyelids
seemed
forced
open
and
the
eyes
of
josh
maybee
and
nathan
gomer
met
for
an
instant
there
was
perfect
silence
accompanied
by
a
fixed
stare
on
both
sides
maybee
being
uncertain
whether
he
was
dreaming
or
awake
then
nathan
grinned
whereupon
maybee
uttered
a
roar
of
fright
and
would
have
leaped
out
of
bed
but
that
nathan
restrained
him
bade
him
lie
down
again
and
not
be
terrified
he
called
upon
him
to
preserve
his
calmness
as
he
desired
to
have
a
long
conversation
with
him
he
also
told
him
that
he
would
have
occasion
to
exercise
his
memory
with
patient
perseverance
and
to
communicate
the
result
of
the
examination
to
him
he
added
that
he
might
expect
immediate
remuneration
for
his
revelations
equivalent
to
their
value
as
well
as
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
liberation
from
the
den
in
which
he
had
so
long
been
incarcerated
josh
maybee
listened
in
silent
amazement
he
looked
distrustfully
and
suspiciously
at
his
mysterious
visitor
and
notwithstanding
the
grand
promises
of
pecuniary
recompense
and
release
from
imprisonment
he
did
not
seem
disposed
to
entertain
the
proposition
or
to
do
anything
indeed
to
prolong
the
interview
his
flesh
crawled
as
he
looked
upon
the
singular
features
of
the
strange
being
before
him
who
nodded
and
grinned
at
him
very
much
after
the
manner
of
the
gnomes
of
the
golden
harz
of
whom
in
his
younger
days
he
had
read
with
awe
and
he
could
hardly
help
thinking
that
the
little
stranger
was
at
least
a
native
of
a
lower
world
gifted
with
the
power
of
appearing
on
earth
adopting
when
he
availed
himself
of
the
advantage
he
possessed
a
form
and
deportment
calculated
to
fling
into
hysterics
of
terror
all
whom
he
honoured
with
his
presence
it
was
not
until
hathan
gomer
perceived
the
alarm
his
appearance
excited
that
he
more
clearly
explained
the
nature
of
his
visit
and
displayed
his
knowledge
of
the
information
obtained
from
chewkle
then
maybee
became
more
composed
quitted
his
squalid
bed
and
dressed
himself
in
his
greased
and
faded
habiliments
by
the
liberality
of
gomer
he
was
provided
with
a
breakfast
the
like
of
which
he
had
not
tasted
for
years
and
when
he
had
finished
his
repast
and
emotions
stole
over
him
of
a
right
royal
and
monarchical
character
nathan
commenced
enlisting
his
sympathies
in
favour
of
wilton
and
his
daughter
whom
he
remembered
on
his
attention
being
drawn
to
them
he
followed
up
his
observations
by
reverting
to
the
earlier
periods
of
life
extorted
from
him
a
complete
history
of
past
events
and
elicited
as
he
proceeded
all
that
was
essential
to
the
establishment
of
claim
to
the
estates
left
by
old
eglinton
this
done
nathan
gomer
being
beyond
a
doubt
satisfied
on
even
to
the
production
of
documents
entered
into
a
compact
with
joshua
maybee
which
the
latter
swore
to
fulfil
the
dwarf
having
supplied
the
poor
old
prisoner
with
funds
arranged
when
he
would
again
see
him
and
then
took
his
departure
he
jumped
into
a
cab
on
quitting
the
prison
and
drove
to
a
the
interview
between
him
and
his
legal
adviser
was
marked
by
much
excitement
on
the
part
of
nathan
gomer
and
evident
surprise
on
that
of
the
lawyer
as
well
as
by
the
rapid
taking
of
notes
when
this
interview
terminated
nathan
flung
himself
once
more
into
a
cab
and
was
whirled
away
at
a
smart
pace
for
a
new
destination
chewkle
during
this
period
sat
in
the
at
the
railway
station
patiently
for
he
was
amused
by
the
coming
and
going
of
persons
by
the
diversity
of
bags
and
parcels
moving
to
and
fro
the
contents
of
which
he
imagined
and
coveted
and
the
general
activity
and
bustle
prevailing
in
such
a
place
but
when
ten
struck
he
began
to
fancy
that
he
had
mistaken
the
time
appointed
and
had
arrived
here
an
hour
before
his
time
he
sharply
examined
every
person
who
entered
expecting
to
see
nathan
but
eleven
came
and
passed
and
gomer
had
not
made
his
appearance
chewkle
now
began
to
grow
uneasy
he
went
carefully
over
the
last
interview
but
could
not
alight
upon
any
part
of
it
in
which
to
use
his
own
language
he
had
himself
he
therefore
tried
to
content
himself
by
assuming
that
nathan
gomer
had
been
unexpectedly
detained
on
some
important
business
and
he
decided
on
allowing
him
the
latitude
of
another
hour
it
was
striking
twelve
when
exhausted
by
the
dreary
task
of
enduring
three
expectancy
he
rose
to
depart
having
fixed
his
eye
upon
a
black
leather
travelling
bag
which
seemed
to
be
worth
taking
away
he
advanced
towards
it
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
about
to
take
possession
of
his
own
property
and
hurry
away
with
it
he
had
his
hand
upon
the
handle
and
was
in
the
act
of
making
a
plunge
at
the
doorway
when
he
felt
himself
seized
by
the
wrist
and
a
voice
said
sharply
in
his
ear
down
that
bag
he
dropped
it
instanter
and
turned
to
apologise
for
his
to
as
he
presumed
an
officer
but
found
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
nathan
gomer
his
jaw
dropped
he
uttered
a
kind
of
hysterical
screeching
laugh
and
gasped
out
something
respecting
being
made
to
wait
so
long
without
having
anything
to
amuse
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
felt
inwardly
convinced
that
the
dwarf
had
been
hiding
somewhere
ever
since
nine
to
have
the
opportunity
of
pouncing
upon
him
in
the
very
act
in
which
he
was
caught
nathan
made
no
allusion
to
the
discrepancy
between
the
hour
he
had
named
to
meet
chewkle
and
that
at
which
he
appeared
he
merely
said
me
he
quitted
his
hold
of
chewkle
as
he
spoke
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
station
into
the
street
and
chewkle
followed
him
at
the
same
rapid
pace
nathan
made
his
way
to
a
small
tavern
in
the
vicinity
and
diving
into
a
low
dark
room
motioned
to
chewkle
who
was
at
his
heels
with
an
unpleasant
suspicion
that
a
policeman
was
bringing
up
the
rear
to
take
a
seat
he
ordered
chewkle
a
stiff
glass
of
a
compound
called
by
a
most
elastic
stretch
of
the
imagination
brandy
and
water
and
when
they
were
alone
and
chewkle
actively
engaged
in
disposing
of
his
powerful
beverage
nathan
briefly
told
him
that
he
had
decided
to
take
no
steps
in
the
matter
upon
which
he
chewkle
had
on
the
previous
evening
visited
him
made
up
your
mind
to
that
eh
said
chewkle
eyeing
him
steadfastly
i
am
resolved
was
the
reply
may
change
your
mind
suggested
chewkle
said
gomer
will
make
me
alter
my
can
observed
chewkle
emphatically
the
same
propositions
and
inducements
have
been
held
out
before
but
proved
after
considerable
cost
urged
chewkle
nathan
gomer
shook
his
head
tell
you
it
cried
chewkle
almost
fiercely
he
exclaimed
in
a
lower
tone
and
touching
nathan
on
the
sleeve
rather
wilton
have
the
property
than
grahame
you
nathan
nodded
suppose
the
man
i
spoke
to
you
about
last
night
was
to
die
die
echoed
nathan
coldly
was
to
die
all
of
a
sudding
and
i
was
to
put
into
hand
a
cettifyket
of
the
death
he
would
push
on
his
claim
only
chance
would
be
floored
and
grahame
must
the
man
is
healthy
and
die
suggested
gomer
with
a
air
which
had
its
effect
men
die
very
suddenly
sometimes
you
know
said
chewkle
in
a
meaning
tone
its
a
strornirary
fact
that
men
who
are
wanted
out
the
way
goes
out
of
the
way
jest
in
the
nick
nathan
felt
the
roots
of
his
hair
tingle
and
vibrate
the
scoundrel
meant
murder
he
was
sure
of
that
he
made
no
answer
chewlde
dropped
his
head
suddenly
and
hissed
in
ear
old
wilton
hisself
was
to
turn
up
his
toes
when
he
was
out
a
walking
eh
i
grahame
would
come
in
for
the
swag
then
eh
a
keen
sort
i
can
tell
face
grew
a
deeper
amber
than
ever
his
eyes
almost
blazed
in
their
brightness
he
felt
a
kind
of
choking
sensation
but
he
controlled
himself
has
a
son
he
murmured
away
not
known
where
as
they
says
on
the
enwellops
when
a
letter
with
a
writ
in
it
comes
back
replied
chewkle
quickly
he
added
would
have
possession
of
the
lot
before
that
young
un
turned
up
and
if
he
ever
should
show
again
he
easily
get
out
of
the
nathan
gomer
mused
presently
he
said
is
something
in
your
suggestion
worth
knows
there
is
chimed
in
chewkle
may
therefore
alter
my
mind
in
so
far
as
paying
wilton
a
visit
and
consulting
with
him
upon
it
observed
gomer
really
i
think
anything
will
come
of
it
in
the
face
of
the
arrangement
now
being
effected
he
continued
the
dockyments
signed
by
both
parties
inquired
chewkle
rather
eagerly
they
are
not
yet
signed
replied
gomer
a
part
of
the
provisions
have
been
carried
out
for
i
have
advanced
grahame
a
large
sum
of
knows
it
on
the
understanding
that
if
the
agreement
completed
he
is
to
return
all
the
money
do
it
returned
chewkle
emphatically
came
down
upon
him
with
that
proposal
like
a
hangel
from
the
sky
and
saved
him
from
crunching
up
like
a
bit
burnt
wood
you
saved
him
from
wuss
much
wuss
but
neither
here
nor
there
he
let
a
chance
slip
to
get
the
whole
of
the
estate
into
his
claws
try
a
leetle
more
this
brandy
if
you
please
some
the
right
sort
this
is
subjoined
chewkle
labouring
under
a
delirious
delusion
on
that
point
his
glass
was
replenished
and
the
interval
seemed
to
give
nathan
gomer
time
to
cogitate
although
actually
his
plan
had
been
matured
before
he
sought
chewkle
at
the
railway
station
at
length
he
said
will
see
wilton
but
i
can
not
make
the
journey
to
harleydale
until
three
weeks
have
weeks
echoed
chewkle
three
years
wilton
may
be
dead
before
three
weeks
is
thought
gomer
he
fixed
his
eye
upon
chewkle
and
said
is
as
providence
directs
for
myself
i
have
important
business
in
birmingham
manchester
liverpool
and
dublin
which
must
be
transacted
and
i
have
no
one
to
nominate
in
my
place
if
i
go
to
i
do
the
work
exclaimed
chewkle
falling
plump
into
the
trap
exclaimed
gomer
inquiringly
i
am
used
to
all
sorts
of
commission
work
and
collecting
hunt
up
a
man
with
any
officer
in
the
force
and
dun
a
man
out
of
his
account
and
out
of
his
mind
with
any
collector
in
the
commission
asked
gomer
leave
that
to
you
i
has
five
per
cent
on
small
things
and
two
and
on
large
and
my
expenses
but
leave
that
to
gomer
sat
and
mused
and
expressed
doubts
as
to
whether
he
could
trust
him
and
played
so
much
and
so
well
with
his
fish
that
the
latter
absolutely
gorged
himself
with
the
hook
he
importuned
the
dwarf
so
urgently
at
last
to
employ
him
in
the
business
he
spoke
of
that
the
little
man
consented
on
condition
that
he
started
to
birmingham
by
the
three
train
that
day
to
this
proposition
chewkle
assented
readily
and
declared
himself
ready
to
go
home
to
his
lodgings
at
once
get
a
few
things
for
his
journey
and
then
depart
on
his
mission
gomer
accompanied
him
furnished
him
with
papers
instructions
and
money
for
his
travelling
expenses
and
never
left
him
until
he
saw
the
train
leave
the
platform
at
euston
square
station
with
chewkle
inside
bound
for
birmingham
nathan
gomer
returned
to
his
and
it
was
late
at
night
before
he
saw
his
bed
the
following
morning
an
application
was
made
in
the
court
of
chancery
in
the
case
of
maybee
and
an
eloquent
counsel
dwelt
long
and
forcibly
on
the
terrible
punishment
inflicted
upon
a
man
imprisoned
for
eighteen
years
through
an
act
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
his
solicitor
the
lord
chancellor
granted
an
order
for
the
man
to
be
produced
in
court
and
on
the
following
day
wan
haggard
and
sallow
in
the
face
dirty
and
tattered
in
his
attire
he
was
brought
before
the
lord
chancellor
in
the
custody
of
an
officer
of
the
prison
the
lord
chancellor
interrogated
him
and
elicited
much
that
excited
great
commiseration
and
his
discharge
was
ordered
forthwith
the
necessary
legal
forms
having
been
complied
with
nathan
gomer
conveyed
him
away
from
the
prison
after
settling
all
claims
and
bore
him
where
chewkle
was
likely
to
have
much
trouble
to
find
him
nathan
had
requested
chewkle
to
correspond
with
him
at
stated
intervals
and
inform
him
of
the
progress
he
had
made
in
the
mission
he
had
undertaken
chiefly
a
collection
of
overdue
bills
the
agent
duly
kept
his
engagements
although
nathan
gomer
began
to
have
shrewd
suspicions
that
he
was
keeping
as
well
some
of
the
proceeds
however
the
postmarks
upon
his
communications
were
evidence
of
his
being
far
from
london
and
that
served
the
purpose
of
his
employer
to
perfection
having
made
skilful
and
satisfactory
arrangements
in
london
nathan
gomer
started
from
thence
to
harleydale
manor
to
have
an
interview
with
wilton
upon
the
new
and
important
phase
in
his
situation
he
arrived
at
his
destination
at
a
remarkable
moment
on
reaching
the
and
entering
the
hall
he
gave
his
name
to
the
and
was
informed
that
a
servant
had
the
moment
previously
ascended
to
the
library
to
announce
a
gentleman
who
had
followed
him
up
nathan
gomer
with
a
light
step
sprang
up
the
stairs
and
arrived
at
the
library
door
as
the
servant
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
announced
mark
for
the
moment
he
was
astounded
but
recovering
himself
he
raised
his
finger
to
the
servant
who
recognized
him
and
would
have
announced
him
too
he
glided
behind
a
screen
and
awaited
the
result
of
a
meeting
which
he
knew
would
prove
of
a
peculiar
kind
he
had
no
conception
of
the
scene
enacting
at
the
moment
of
arrival
and
he
was
to
be
surprised
even
yet
more
than
he
expected
old
wilton
upon
the
name
of
his
son
being
announced
started
and
staggered
as
if
he
had
been
smitten
a
violent
blow
then
he
drew
himself
up
erect
his
flushed
face
became
pale
and
his
brow
remained
contracted
as
sternly
as
before
mark
wilton
entered
with
a
hasty
step
and
advanced
rapidly
to
his
father
with
the
intention
of
embracing
him
but
he
paused
upon
observing
the
old
attitude
and
demeanour
he
stretched
out
his
hands
he
exclaimed
with
emotion
the
old
man
remained
rigid
as
a
statue
and
made
no
sign
of
taking
the
proffered
hands
how
changed
he
was
since
mark
had
last
seen
him
then
in
a
poor
lodging
surrounded
by
poverty
and
bowed
by
care
and
toil
he
seemed
the
poor
haggard
slave
of
want
now
the
tenant
of
a
noble
mansion
attired
as
a
gentleman
conscious
of
the
position
to
which
he
had
been
born
he
looked
like
a
patrician
only
to
be
approached
with
deference
and
humility
but
for
certain
characteristics
of
feature
mark
would
not
have
known
him
again
wilton
regarded
his
son
with
a
glance
which
while
it
noted
the
change
that
time
and
climate
had
made
in
him
too
abated
none
of
its
sternness
mark
wilton
he
said
in
harsh
tones
have
passed
since
you
flung
away
your
title
to
address
me
by
the
name
of
father
you
quitted
my
roof
by
an
exercise
of
your
own
you
return
to
me
i
presume
under
a
similar
influence
not
having
during
the
whole
interval
communicated
with
me
or
any
of
your
relatives
i
am
therefore
to
attribute
i
suppose
your
present
visit
to
the
circumstance
of
a
change
for
the
better
in
my
condition
reaching
your
filial
face
became
the
hue
of
crimson
he
folded
his
arms
and
looked
his
father
steadfastly
in
the
eyes
left
home
sir
he
exclaimed
in
a
firm
tone
motives
which
i
had
hoped
you
would
have
appreciated
i
was
a
burden
to
you
sir
in
your
poverty
i
absorbed
a
share
of
that
income
which
was
barely
enough
to
support
the
family
without
my
addition
i
had
no
means
of
aiding
you
for
i
knew
no
trade
i
left
you
therefore
to
fight
the
world
as
best
i
could
so
that
i
relieved
you
of
a
tax
upon
your
exertions
i
left
you
in
silence
because
i
would
spare
myself
the
entreaties
the
urgings
and
implorings
to
me
to
remain
at
home
they
would
have
deeply
affected
and
pained
me
without
making
me
swerve
from
my
purpose
i
have
remained
silent
during
my
absence
because
my
career
has
been
a
chequered
one
i
would
not
write
to
you
until
i
could
send
some
earnest
of
my
love
for
you
all
with
my
communication
it
was
only
at
the
last
moment
when
almost
in
a
day
i
became
the
owner
of
considerable
wealth
that
i
felt
the
time
had
come
for
you
to
be
made
acquainted
with
my
existence
and
immediately
i
hastened
to
england
to
share
with
you
what
i
had
obtained
and
if
it
were
not
enough
for
all
to
leave
you
once
more
until
i
had
won
from
fortune
sufficient
for
myself
such
sir
are
the
facts
i
can
not
beg
you
to
believe
them
because
you
know
sir
as
a
boy
i
respected
truth
too
reverently
to
give
you
the
right
to
doubt
them
i
have
no
more
to
say
sir
than
this
my
bursting
heart
tells
me
that
had
my
most
fondly
loved
my
sainted
mother
have
been
spared
by
god
to
have
met
me
here
my
reception
would
not
have
been
such
as
you
have
extended
to
mark
pressed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
there
was
a
convulsive
twitching
about
the
mouth
of
old
wilton
and
his
eyelids
filled
with
water
he
exclaimed
in
a
husky
voice
my
son
in
the
name
of
her
whom
you
have
apostrophised
come
to
my
heart
mark
sprang
into
his
arms
and
they
embraced
they
wrung
each
hands
warmly
and
the
reconciliation
was
complete
harry
vivian
would
have
retired
to
leave
the
father
and
son
to
themselves
though
colonel
mires
did
not
offer
to
move
but
old
wilton
waved
his
hand
to
him
to
stay
will
oblige
me
by
remaining
if
you
please
vivian
he
said
making
an
effort
to
clear
his
voice
will
settle
our
little
unpleasant
conference
before
you
take
your
departure
you
must
see
that
it
will
be
wise
to
do
so
nay
that
it
will
emphatically
be
necessary
to
do
exclaimed
young
wilton
suddenly
that
nephew
old
wilton
assented
grandly
with
his
head
the
manner
was
distinctly
patronising
alas
how
easy
it
is
to
forget
past
services
when
the
remembrance
would
interfere
with
present
selfish
considerations
young
wilton
advanced
rapidly
to
where
vivian
stood
and
seized
his
hand
he
cried
exclaimed
hal
the
grasp
of
the
hand
that
followed
was
not
less
warm
and
earnest
than
that
which
had
taken
place
between
father
and
son
mark
knew
nature
well
and
prized
its
worth
at
its
true
value
after
a
few
brief
words
of
congratulation
on
both
sides
mark
said
father
speaks
of
an
he
looked
sharply
at
colonel
mires
hope
hal
there
is
nothing
between
you
and
silent
for
the
present
mark
exclaimed
his
father
hastily
shall
know
all
shortly
and
i
am
sure
you
will
see
matters
from
the
same
point
of
view
as
myself
vivian
you
were
about
to
speak
when
my
son
entered
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
proceed
my
son
may
as
well
be
present
at
what
is
about
to
take
hal
bowed
have
but
little
to
say
wilton
he
exclaimed
in
reply
that
little
i
trust
will
be
to
the
pur
pose
i
have
been
charged
with
having
surreptitiously
and
artfully
ensnared
the
affections
of
your
daughter
miss
wilton
i
answer
that
this
charge
has
been
made
to
you
by
one
who
deliberately
preferred
it
knowing
it
to
be
utterly
shamefully
and
scandalously
colonel
mires
with
a
furious
gesture
sprang
to
his
feet
harry
vivian
turned
to
him
with
a
firm
unmoved
air
and
waved
him
calmly
but
contemptuously
back
to
his
seat
wilton
he
said
with
dignified
appeal
remained
silent
while
contumely
and
base
imputations
were
heaped
upon
my
head
i
expect
nay
i
demand
that
at
least
justice
be
rendered
to
me
mark
wilton
appeared
by
what
was
passing
and
stood
gazing
upon
his
father
and
his
old
playmate
in
mate
surprise
in
the
meanwhile
wilton
observed
hastily
to
the
accused
vivian
it
is
your
right
and
justice
shall
be
meted
out
to
you
but
this
distinct
denial
so
unexpected
what
does
it
mean
wilton
returned
vivian
unable
to
control
the
excitement
under
which
every
nerve
quivered
while
acknowledging
a
deep
and
passionate
love
for
your
daughter
miss
wilton
i
scornfully
and
indignantly
repudiate
the
infamous
charge
of
having
surreptitiously
or
insidiously
attempted
to
win
her
heart
i
have
sir
so
instinctive
so
full
a
perception
of
her
innocence
and
purity
of
the
natural
delicacy
of
the
direction
of
her
mind
that
a
purpose
so
base
would
never
suggest
itself
to
me
further
sir
i
consider
the
presumption
that
miss
wilton
would
lend
an
ear
to
such
incitement
an
insult
to
her
and
but
for
your
presence
i
would
have
lashed
like
a
hound
the
paltry
knave
who
is
the
author
of
the
insult
and
of
the
lie
wilton
i
can
not
submit
to
this
outrage
roared
colonel
mires
once
more
starting
to
his
feet
and
making
a
dash
at
hal
but
mark
wilton
sprang
forward
and
stayed
him
he
forced
him
back
to
the
spot
where
he
had
been
seated
know
not
who
you
are
or
under
what
circumstances
you
are
here
he
said
sternly
to
him
i
do
know
vivian
and
i
have
the
fullest
faith
in
his
honour
i
know
too
by
what
has
just
passed
that
you
have
been
using
the
name
of
my
sister
too
freely
and
too
impertinently
for
my
satisfaction
now
you
must
not
attempt
here
by
blustering
or
playing
the
part
of
a
bully
to
seek
to
escape
from
your
position
you
must
either
prove
what
you
have
gone
so
far
as
to
assert
or
you
must
look
to
be
expelled
hence
by
an
operation
more
summary
than
me
cried
mires
his
lips
purple
with
passion
wilton
as
your
guest
i
claim
to
be
treated
with
propriety
and
wilton
called
impetuously
to
his
son
to
return
to
his
side
and
suggested
to
colonel
mires
that
his
own
intemperate
movement
had
caused
interference
he
then
turned
to
hal
and
said
vivian
you
register
a
denial
and
make
an
admission
in
a
breath
are
you
prepared
upon
your
honour
to
state
that
you
have
had
no
clandestine
meeting
with
my
daughter
at
any
period
of
your
acquaintance
almost
screamed
mires
you
dare
to
utter
a
falsehood
so
easily
and
so
clearly
to
be
disproved
whom
asked
hal
contemptuously
me
he
cried
with
furious
emphasis
hal
regarded
him
with
a
scornful
curl
of
the
lip
and
said
have
not
to
learn
that
you
find
pleasure
in
sneaking
into
shadowy
coverts
and
dark
spots
to
play
the
spy
in
order
that
you
may
fill
well
the
equally
honourable
office
of
informer
i
shall
prove
one
day
to
your
small
satisfaction
in
this
instance
your
contemptible
manouvres
will
avail
you
nothing
they
have
given
you
a
foundation
and
your
own
vile
nature
supplied
materials
for
a
fabric
but
it
is
a
of
the
dirtiest
hal
turned
from
him
to
wilton
and
added
reiterate
sir
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
foundation
for
such
a
charge
once
in
my
life
i
have
met
miss
wilton
alone
but
the
rencontre
was
accidental
and
unexpected
i
have
now
only
to
say
that
undesirous
as
i
am
to
recur
to
the
past
i
am
compelled
to
call
your
attention
to
your
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
which
have
drawn
us
together
and
i
ask
you
to
remember
any
act
of
mine
that
has
given
you
reason
to
doubt
that
i
have
acted
or
should
act
in
any
way
unworthily
or
he
ceased
and
a
silence
of
almost
a
minute
ensued
wilton
did
recur
to
the
past
he
remembered
the
offer
of
service
made
by
the
generous
youth
in
the
hour
of
his
frightful
distress
he
remembered
that
mainly
to
his
gallantry
he
was
indebted
for
not
only
the
life
of
his
daughter
but
for
the
preservation
of
the
important
document
which
had
restored
him
to
his
present
position
but
he
remembered
too
the
vow
he
had
made
to
the
friend
of
his
boyhood
and
it
decided
him
how
to
act
he
looked
upon
handsome
face
flushed
with
excitement
and
felt
that
it
offered
a
fair
excuse
for
predilection
will
soon
wear
off
he
mentally
exclaimed
she
no
longer
meets
with
or
sees
vivian
he
said
addressing
him
with
an
assumed
calm
loftiness
am
content
to
believe
that
you
may
have
conceived
an
attachment
for
my
daughter
and
that
you
have
not
acted
upon
that
impression
to
secretly
endeavour
to
secure
her
affection
in
return
let
all
that
has
been
said
upon
that
point
be
at
once
and
for
ever
buried
it
however
becomes
a
grave
duty
on
my
part
to
counsel
you
to
eradicate
that
passion
because
it
can
never
be
recompensed
as
you
may
hope
my
daughter
flora
is
she
was
promised
to
that
individual
when
in
infancy
even
under
a
vow
to
ratify
it
i
can
not
recall
it
i
would
not
if
i
could
she
never
can
be
yours
now
vivian
i
am
not
unmindful
of
your
past
services
i
appreciate
them
warmly
and
am
most
unlikely
to
forget
them
by
any
breach
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
but
you
must
see
this
can
no
longer
be
a
place
for
you
to
visit
i
must
therefore
take
my
farewell
of
you
i
shall
be
happy
to
hear
of
your
future
welfare
and
of
your
fame
for
i
have
always
entertained
an
opinion
that
a
high
destiny
awaits
you
at
any
time
that
i
can
be
of
hal
made
an
impatient
indignant
gesture
wilton
bowed
understand
the
feeling
he
said
i
honour
it
however
i
desire
not
to
part
in
anger
with
you
be
this
the
proof
he
tendered
his
hand
to
hal
who
coldly
received
it
concluded
wilton
impressively
desire
that
we
may
part
at
your
earliest
convenience
with
this
i
terminate
this
most
unpleasant
interview
and
would
crave
to
be
left
alone
with
my
hal
bowed
stiffly
and
proceeded
to
retire
colonel
mires
rose
to
depart
also
mark
wilton
stepped
before
him
he
said
sternly
pointing
to
the
seat
may
have
something
more
to
tell
my
father
and
permit
me
to
suggest
to
you
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
father
he
said
will
attend
vivian
during
the
remainder
of
his
brief
stay
for
the
honour
of
the
house
and
you
understand
he
concluded
hastily
as
he
ran
after
young
vivian
wilton
glanced
at
the
passionate
workings
of
colonel
features
as
he
watched
hal
depart
and
comprehended
his
meaning
at
once
he
therefore
detained
the
colonel
with
him
until
return
informed
him
of
departure
immediately
after
mark
had
disappeared
nathan
gomer
glided
out
of
the
room
too
and
pausing
in
the
corridor
muttered
to
himself
like
this
what
does
the
old
man
want
he
had
enough
sorrow
and
affliction
in
his
poverty
does
he
want
to
create
a
condition
of
unhappiness
in
his
wealth
he
i
will
see
flora
and
talk
with
her
about
this
affair
my
mission
is
to
see
the
children
all
happy
and
i
will
ay
i
as
he
concluded
he
rapidly
made
his
way
to
chamber
and
tapped
lightly
at
the
door
chapter
lester
vane
and
helen
forbear
my
lord
here
let
me
rather
die
and
end
my
sorrows
and
my
shame
for
ever
away
with
this
perverseness
too
much
nay
if
you
strive
monstrous
affectation
retire
i
beg
you
leave
me
thus
to
coy
it
with

rowe
lotte
clinton
when
she
beheld
a
young
man
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
at
her
although
startled
by
the
sudden
fright
exhibited
by
helen
grahame
felt
assured
that
the
smartly
attired
apparition
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
room
he
intended
to
visit
she
rose
hastily
and
advanced
towards
him
to
prevent
his
entering
further
into
the
room
and
acquainted
him
with
the
conclusion
at
which
she
arrived
he
shook
his
head
and
laughed
he
returned
no
my
dear
madam
i
have
made
no
mistake
i
came
to
see
i
do
not
know
you
she
replied
quietly
suppose
not
we
have
met
before
though
he
exclaimed
have
no
recollection
of
you
she
said
with
an
inquiring
look
at
his
face
dare
say
not
he
answered
with
an
undisguised
stare
of
admiration
countenance
possesses
no
such
points
of
attraction
as
yours
your
charming
features
struck
me
forcibly
when
i
first
beheld
them
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
them
out
of
my
head
since
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
discovering
you
but
i
have
at
last
succeeded
and
i
have
now
come
to
improve
our
friendship
and
make
you
love
me
if
i
it
flashed
across
the
mind
of
lotte
that
this
was
benevolent
hero
who
was
anxious
to
present
her
with
a
fortune
her
face
and
neck
instantly
became
of
the
hue
of
scarlet
have
come
here
to
insult
me
she
cried
indignantly
unless
you
immediately
depart
i
will
summon
assistance
leave
my
room
sir
she
uttered
this
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
the
young
man
with
an
alarmed
aspect
raised
both
his
hands
deprecatingly
hush
make
such
a
noise
he
cried
have
not
come
here
to
insult
you
i
like
you
too
much
for
that
upon
my
honour
and
soul
i
do
now
sit
down
and
let
me
talk
quietly
to
you
i
am
wealthy
and
lotte
stamped
her
foot
passionately
this
room
sir
quit
this
house
this
instant
sir
or
scream
for
with
a
hurried
gesture
the
intruder
closed
the
door
and
said
hastily
tell
you
i
want
in
any
way
to
offend
you
i
came
here
if
possible
to
make
you
think
well
of
me
and
look
kindly
upon
me
as
i
do
on
you
consider
i
am
a
gentleman
born
i
mind
telling
you
that
i
am
a
grahame
i
mind
telling
you
that
lotte
started
as
she
heard
the
name
and
with
distended
eyelids
looked
again
at
his
face
what
name
she
inquired
he
answered
a
place
in
the
park
and
one
in
scotland
my
name
is
malcolm
malcolm
grahame
i
saw
you
in
the
garden
at
you
recollect
lotte
did
indeed
this
then
was
brother
all
unconscious
that
a
thin
partition
alone
divided
him
from
his
missing
sister
lotte
reflected
for
a
moment
he
had
certainly
seen
his
sister
had
he
recognised
her
this
she
had
to
learn
perhaps
he
had
come
with
the
purpose
of
endeavouring
to
discover
and
take
her
away
she
determined
he
should
not
succeed
unless
with
own
consent
she
felt
that
she
had
a
difficult
task
to
play
and
one
likely
to
be
in
all
respects
unpleasant
she
was
however
equally
conscious
that
she
had
undertaken
as
a
duty
the
office
of
protecting
and
assisting
helen
with
the
object
if
possible
of
preserving
her
fair
fame
through
the
present
terrible
phase
of
her
existence
she
would
not
therefore
permit
the
fear
of
personal
insult
or
threatened
dangers
of
other
kinds
to
make
her
shrink
from
the
responsibility
she
had
so
nobly
now
said
malcolm
coaxingly
on
observing
her
muse
will
let
me
sit
down
for
a
few
minutes
you
i
do
want
to
set
myself
right
with
lotte
trembled
and
looked
very
pale
and
then
red
she
would
then
and
there
have
ended
the
interview
if
she
had
given
way
to
her
natural
impulse
but
she
knew
how
earnestly
helen
wished
to
learn
what
had
followed
her
departure
from
home
and
so
for
her
sake
she
said
it
may
appear
strange
after
what
has
just
passed
that
i
should
seem
to
desire
to
prolong
this
interview
but
i
have
a
question
or
two
to
ask
of
shall
be
delighted
to
answer
any
questions
you
may
put
to
me
if
i
can
do
she
made
a
brave
effort
to
seem
collected
while
he
was
admiring
the
graceful
line
from
her
head
to
her
shoulder
as
her
face
was
averted
and
then
she
turned
to
him
and
said
have
no
desire
to
be
improperly
inquisitive
sir
nor
to
wound
your
feelings
by
the
questions
i
may
put
to
you
but
i
have
a
good
motive
and
no
injury
to
you
or
your
family
can
result
from
your
answering
me
nice
answered
malcolm
go
have
no
member
of
your
family
ill
i
believe
commenced
lotte
with
a
beating
heart
for
she
knew
there
was
another
ear
beside
her
own
who
would
greedily
drink
in
all
his
replies
no
he
returned
unsuspiciously
i
often
see
the
governor
for
he
is
much
engaged
and
when
he
is
not
he
is
something
like
a
porcupine
not
to
be
too
closely
approached
as
for
ma
i
never
knew
her
to
be
ill
it
is
undignified
so
she
condescend
to
have
an
ailment
and
my
sister
margaret
thinks
as
she
does
ha
ha
no
they
are
well
enough
he
concluded
said
lotte
pursuing
her
point
have
other
yes
oh
ay
he
responded
is
little
eva
upon
my
honour
i
had
forgotten
her
really
how
droll
well
she
is
not
i
think
in
good
health
she
is
she
frets
a
great
deal
goes
into
corners
and
cries
walks
into
the
garden
and
cries
wanders
over
the
house
and
cries
a
regular
little
pump
a
nothing
to
her
ha
ha
does
she
fret
inquired
lotte
with
hesitation
a
slight
colour
came
into
face
tell
he
returned
can
tell
i
hardly
think
she
knows
herself
excepting
that
she
has
lost
a
pet
and
favourite
and
she
is
mourning
for
that
stupid
it
was
i
think
an
elder
sister
to
those
you
have
malcolm
coughed
and
grew
red
in
the
face
have
not
mentioned
miss
helen
grahame
what
of
her
malcolm
appeared
unpleasantly
disconcerted
presently
he
said
lotte
started
back
astounded
and
echoed
the
word
in
such
an
incredulous
tone
that
malcolm
added
is
to
us
excuse
me
but
you
are
touching
on
a
tender
point
a
family
but
malcolm
and
lotte
started
as
he
concluded
for
at
this
instant
a
sharp
cry
of
acute
pain
rang
in
their
ears
it
was
followed
by
a
low
wailing
sob
and
then
all
was
silent
again
lotte
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
for
that
burst
of
agony
from
the
inner
room
made
it
ache
she
knew
whence
the
sound
proceeded
and
from
whom
malcolm
was
sufficiently
not
to
make
any
remark
respecting
the
sound
he
had
heard
but
he
thought
it
strange
and
wondered
much
what
it
meant
lotte
recalled
his
straying
thoughts
by
asking
if
his
sister
evangeline
spoke
thus
of
her
sister
helen
he
returned
she
is
nobody
she
is
so
unlike
all
the
family
mamma
told
her
that
she
must
consider
helen
as
dead
and
that
is
why
she
frets
and
whines
about
the
place
so
much
however
the
topic
is
disagreeable
pray
let
us
say
no
more
about
have
ended
sir
returned
lotte
quietly
but
dreading
what
was
to
come
more
questions
to
ask
he
cried
she
shook
her
head
then
he
said
here
you
are
very
pretty
i
never
saw
a
face
i
like
so
much
as
yours
i
am
anxious
that
you
should
understand
that
because
it
is
my
wish
to
have
the
opportunity
of
gazing
upon
it
as
often
as
possible
now
you
are
perpetually
drawing
that
infernal
needle
backwards
and
forwards
from
morning
until
night
making
your
pretty
face
pale
and
weary
and
worn
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
now
my
notion
is
compliment
me
interposed
lotte
interrupted
malcolm
eagerly
in
his
turn
take
you
away
from
this
place
throw
the
needle
to
the
devil
place
you
in
a
pretty
country
house
own
servants
brougham
convert
me
from
a
humble
virtuous
needlewoman
into
a
shameless
and
an
abandoned
outcast
cried
lotte
firmly
and
in
clear
tones
upon
my
honour
he
cried
grahame
i
have
not
spoken
to
you
previous
to
this
hour
but
if
i
had
proposed
as
soon
as
we
met
that
you
should
become
a
thief
a
degraded
and
criminal
rogue
you
would
consider
that
i
had
inflicted
an
insulting
outrage
upon
your
honour
and
you
would
ask
me
indignantly
what
there
was
in
your
conduct
and
your
appearance
that
called
forth
so
great
and
undeserved
an
clearly
but
i
ask
of
what
i
have
been
guilty
that
you
should
so
so
insult
me
she
could
not
keep
down
the
tears
which
would
spring
into
her
eyes
he
perceived
them
and
said
excitedly
want
to
make
you
cry
i
upon
my
upon
my
by
heaven
i
want
to
insult
must
quit
this
place
this
moment
sir
and
return
to
it
no
more
i
caution
you
out
of
considerations
which
you
can
not
surmise
though
you
may
some
day
know
them
not
to
repeat
this
visit
for
it
will
be
at
a
risk
which
knowingly
you
would
fly
from
incurring
go
malcolm
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
he
would
have
spoken
but
lotte
walked
out
of
the
room
and
left
him
so
he
descended
the
stairs
feeling
that
he
had
not
been
anything
like
so
successful
as
he
had
hoped
have
broken
the
ice
though
he
muttered
with
a
nod
of
the
head
is
something
she
is
very
pretty
and
very
scornful
by
jove
but
then
girls
are
always
coy
at
first
the
next
step
capital
idea
go
and
see
lester
vane
and
get
his
advice
strange
that
she
should
ask
about
the
people
at
home
odd
thing
that
what
did
it
mean
he
had
not
much
brains
to
puzzle
so
he
soon
gave
up
speculating
upon
what
he
could
find
no
clue
to
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
return
of
lester
vane
to
town
for
after
the
incident
which
had
occurred
at
harleydale
manor
and
which
had
ended
as
it
were
in
the
expulsion
of
young
vivian
old
wilton
had
an
interview
with
him
and
suggested
that
under
existing
circumstances
it
would
be
the
best
policy
for
him
to
take
his
leave
and
return
when
mind
was
more
calm
and
he
would
have
the
field
to
himself
lester
vane
the
more
readily
assented
to
this
proposition
as
a
glance
at
mark
form
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
told
him
he
had
somewhere
met
him
under
disagreeable
circumstances
although
his
memory
would
not
furnish
him
with
the
details
and
for
the
present
is
would
be
politic
to
avoid
him
he
therefore
acted
upon
the
suggestion
and
disappeared
from
harleydale
he
had
not
been
many
days
in
london
before
malcolm
grahame
called
on
him
and
after
some
desultory
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
name
arose
and
he
had
to
repress
further
questioning
by
declaring
that
she
was
on
a
visit
to
a
branch
of
the
family
in
the
wilds
of
scotland
he
stated
his
own
case
his
design
and
the
difficulties
which
hitherto
had
prevented
him
from
carrying
it
into
execution
vane
regarded
him
with
a
smile
of
contempt
even
as
he
pricked
up
his
ears
at
glowing
description
of
the
beauty
of
the
girl
of
whom
he
spoke
malcolm
was
cunning
enough
to
conceal
that
she
was
the
heroine
of
the
adventure
in
hyde
park
but
all
else
he
knew
respecting
her
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
vane
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
his
cigar
in
deep
thought
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
malcolm
and
said
in
a
decided
manner
tell
you
what
grahame
you
have
gone
the
wrong
way
to
work
with
this
girl
she
has
got
some
lofty
notions
about
the
church
and
the
ring
and
you
at
once
kicked
the
two
out
of
your
offer
i
wonder
she
did
not
bring
in
some
tall
lout
of
a
brother
to
beat
you
unmercifully
for
your
cool
audacity
i
tell
you
grahame
your
chance
with
her
is
over
unless
your
proceeding
is
explained
as
a
mistake
i
will
see
her
assure
her
that
an
error
or
a
misconception
has
sprung
up
between
you
and
prevail
upon
her
to
give
you
another
really
this
is
kind
of
you
said
malcolm
shaking
his
hand
heartily
a
few
evenings
afterwards
lester
vane
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
lotte
dwelt
a
child
opened
the
door
and
he
having
had
a
full
description
from
malcolm
of
the
part
of
the
building
in
which
lotte
was
located
ascended
the
stairs
with
a
noiseless
footstep
and
paused
before
her
he
listened
all
was
quiet
within
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
to
find
himself
suddenly
face
to
face
with
helen
grahame
both
started
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
perhaps
the
intensity
of
surprise
was
exhibited
in
a
greater
degree
by
lester
vane
than
by
helen
yet
it
flashed
through
his
mind
that
malcolm
grahame
had
appeared
fidgetty
and
uneasy
while
being
questioned
respecting
his
sister
and
the
place
where
he
said
she
had
gone
to
pay
a
visit
a
glance
at
helen
told
him
that
something
grave
had
happened
that
she
had
quitted
home
under
circumstances
of
an
unfavourable
kind
though
what
they
could
be
he
was
wholly
at
a
loss
to
divine
he
felt
too
that
at
that
moment
he
was
master
of
the
situation
and
the
revenge
he
had
promised
himself
was
within
his
reach
how
did
she
feel
she
who
had
contemplated
leading
this
man
on
by
the
small
stratagems
of
a
heartless
coquette
to
become
her
adoring
slave
that
she
might
at
an
instant
turn
on
him
and
crush
him
with
her
scorn
oh
she
was
humiliated
indeed
never
did
she
feel
the
beauty
and
the
value
of
truthfulness
so
much
as
now
vane
was
the
first
to
speak
he
fastened
his
eye
upon
her
with
the
insulting
gaze
of
an
impudent
libertine
grahame
he
said
is
a
pleasure
wholly
unexpected
my
star
is
indeed
in
the
helen
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
she
felt
the
whole
force
of
the
insult
conveyed
by
his
eyes
his
voice
and
his
words
she
responded
with
a
stern
haughty
gaze
vane
she
replied
am
at
a
loss
to
account
for
your
presence
here
it
is
unbidden
and
unwished
for
no
less
than
it
is
intrusive
i
request
that
you
will
me
helen
if
you
prefer
it
miss
grahame
has
miss
grahame
so
soon
forgotten
the
language
her
eyes
have
at
times
addressed
to
me
beneath
her
roof
does
she
expect
that
she
is
to
spread
her
wiles
with
a
result
satisfactory
only
to
herself
that
she
is
to
ensnare
the
eagle
and
that
act
is
to
suffice
to
tame
him
too
she
tried
to
take
captive
my
poor
susceptible
heart
and
if
she
has
succeeded
should
she
wonder
and
feel
insulted
that
i
desire
some
return
are
unmanly
you
are
contemptibly
base
you
would
not
dare
thus
to
insult
me
but
that
you
see
that
i
am
alone
and
unprotected
leave
me
instantly
she
cried
with
a
proud
impatient
passionate
gesture
of
her
hand
he
answered
coolly
until
we
have
come
to
a
better
understanding
with
each
other
it
is
easy
for
me
to
comprehend
indeed
i
am
partly
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
you
have
left
home
for
ever
that
you
are
here
residing
in
humble
obscurity
for
which
you
were
never
destined
in
the
person
of
your
haughty
father
and
your
ridiculously
proud
mother
the
world
has
turned
its
back
upon
you
it
is
for
you
to
do
the
same
upon
helen
frantically
motioned
to
him
to
leave
the
room
her
whole
frame
was
convulsed
with
violent
emotion
she
cried
hoarsely
insulting
villain
go
or
your
continued
presence
will
slay
me
oh
is
there
no
help
near
to
save
me
as
if
in
answer
to
her
appeal
the
door
opened
and
bantom
with
a
slightly
excited
manner
looked
in
he
had
visited
his
friend
in
who
had
been
the
medium
of
malcolm
offer
to
lotte
after
shaking
the
senses
almost
out
of
him
he
extorted
from
him
that
the
who
had
made
a
tool
of
him
lived
next
door
to
residence
bantom
went
there
and
had
an
interview
with
whelks
who
finding
that
bantom
intended
mischief
transferred
to
shoulders
the
responsibility
of
having
insulted
lotte
believing
that
bantom
would
never
find
him
and
if
he
did
he
would
not
dare
to
touch
him
he
had
mistaken
his
man
bantom
had
hunted
vane
down
and
had
caught
him
here
your
pardon
mum
he
said
to
helen
with
a
bow
i
wants
a
word
with
this
feller
lester
vane
turned
fiercely
towards
him
dirty
ruffian
he
exclaimed
dare
you
intrude
here
leave
the
room
this
instant
bantom
knitted
his
brows
lister
wane
it
he
said
with
a
growl
that
meant
mischief
lester
started
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
fellow
wait
until
i
leave
here
he
answered
hastily
your
name
is
lister
wane
it
i
ask
you
that
persisted
bantom
is
fool
go
out
of
the
shall
you
with
do
you
mean
scoundrel
i
talk
to
you
here
but
where
feel
every
word
i
sez
responded
bantom
with
a
grip
he
caught
vane
by
the
collar
and
wrist
and
dragged
him
out
of
the
room
with
rough
violence
but
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
helen
grahame
with
hysteric
joy
saw
herself
thus
unexpectedly
relieved
from
the
presence
of
the
base
and
heartless
villain
who
had
taken
advantage
of
her
defenceless
position
to
so
basely
insult
her
but
the
scene
had
been
too
severe
in
the
emotions
it
occasioned
and
she
had
a
gradually
fading
sense
that
there
was
a
violent
dashing
and
crashing
down
the
staircase
a
terrible
disturbance
in
the
street
which
died
away
leaving
her
in
a
swoon
chapter
a
love
his
years
but
young
but
his
experience
old
his
head
but
his
judgment
ripe
and
in
a
word
for
far
behind
his
worth
come
all
the
praises
that
i
now
bestow
he
is
complete
in
feature
and
in
mind
with
all
good
grace
to
grace
a
gentleman
shakspere
lotte
clinton
returning
home
to
her
apartment
with
some
fresh
work
from
the
persons
who
employed
her
arrived
near
to
her
abode
at
the
culminating
point
of
a
great
disturbance
in
the
immediate
vicinity
with
some
alarm
she
learned
that
the
uproar
had
commenced
in
the
house
in
which
she
resided
and
that
some
low
man
had
grievously
maltreated
a
gentleman
who
had
been
taken
to
the
hospital
while
his
assailant
aided
by
a
large
proportion
of
the
mob
who
it
appeared
had
espoused
his
cause
had
escaped
on
entering
the
house
she
found
the
lodgers
and
the
landlady
assembled
in
solemn
conclave
and
the
moment
they
perceived
her
they
called
upon
her
for
an
explanation
of
such
in
her
apartment
a
demand
she
heard
with
astonishment
and
with
which
she
was
utterly
unable
to
comply
regarding
those
who
addressed
her
with
an
affrighted
look
she
made
no
reply
but
ran
upstairs
entered
her
apartment
and
turned
the
key
for
a
variety
of
strange
thoughts
connected
with
helen
ran
through
her
mind
she
was
not
surprised
to
find
her
pale
and
motionless
tears
still
clinging
to
her
pallid
cheeks
she
threw
down
the
parcel
she
had
brought
home
with
her
and
at
once
applied
some
simple
restoratives
to
her
senseless
companion
but
it
was
not
until
a
long
and
patient
perseverance
had
been
exercised
that
she
was
rewarded
with
the
signs
of
returning
animation
when
helen
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
speak
and
to
recollect
what
had
passed
she
threw
herself
into
arms
and
told
her
all
then
followed
passionate
pleadings
and
supplications
to
the
humble
to
quit
her
present
place
of
abode
and
move
to
another
more
obscure
and
secluded
where
they
were
not
likely
to
be
tracked
nor
disturbed
where
not
even
own
brother
should
for
a
time
know
how
to
find
them
lotte
as
she
listened
to
urgent
appeals
gazed
round
her
neat
little
room
at
her
bird
her
flowers
all
that
made
it
so
cheerful
and
ministered
so
much
to
her
happiness
she
thought
of
the
brief
but
delicious
visits
of
her
brother
and
there
were
latent
impressions
too
most
agreeable
even
to
contemplate
of
probable
morning
calls
to
be
made
by
mark
wilton
these
anticipated
and
other
actual
pleasures
she
must
sacrifice
if
she
complied
with
the
wish
of
helen
nay
more
she
felt
that
a
sudden
departure
and
secret
mode
of
living
must
fling
her
own
fair
character
under
the
shadow
of
suspicion
she
was
progressing
now
in
the
favour
she
was
more
prosperous
than
she
had
ever
been
she
was
lifted
out
of
a
state
of
the
hardest
and
poorest
paid
toil
the
world
seemed
to
begin
to
smile
in
earnest
upon
her
to
go
back
into
a
species
of
obscurity
with
helen
was
to
deaden
if
not
destroy
all
those
brighter
hopes
which
without
making
them
known
to
mortal
she
had
shaped
and
fashioned
and
pressed
to
her
heart
it
was
in
fact
to
renew
under
yet
harder
terms
her
desperate
battle
with
life
all
these
considerations
struck
her
with
their
full
force
the
sacrifice
required
was
of
herself
not
for
herself
she
gazed
thoughtfully
pained
thought
it
was
upon
beautiful
but
face
she
perceived
the
lines
of
acute
misery
which
already
had
begun
to
display
themselves
and
it
flashed
across
her
brain
at
the
instant
that
if
she
said
nay
to
prayer
helen
would
go
alone
into
secrecy
among
strangers
friendless
and
lotte
supported
the
trembling
earnest
agonized
suppliant
in
her
arms
i
had
not
found
a
friend
in
my
extremity
she
whispered
to
her
had
perished
we
will
go
away
from
here
together
and
let
the
world
say
what
it
may
of
me
i
am
innocent
of
i
can
justify
myself
in
the
eyes
of
the
almighty
and
i
need
care
little
for
what
others
may
unkindly
believe
i
may
be
humble
but
you
shall
find
me
miss
grahame
a
true
friend
i
will
sustain
you
to
the
last
in
your
terrible
affliction
to
the
best
of
my
power
so
compose
and
calm
yourself
as
well
as
you
can
and
leave
the
rest
to
lotte
lotte
sobbed
helen
kissing
her
cheek
passionately
more
than
friend
how
can
i
be
ever
sufficiently
grateful
to
you
a
word
not
a
word
cried
lotte
putting
her
hand
gently
before
her
mouth
and
conducting
her
tenderly
to
a
seat
by
eight
the
next
evening
lotte
and
her
companion
had
removed
from
their
late
abode
without
leaving
behind
them
a
clue
to
their
new
address
lotte
had
managed
well
she
had
no
debts
so
it
was
not
likely
that
there
would
be
any
active
inquiries
after
her
when
she
had
left
her
late
landlady
who
liked
all
her
lodgers
to
be
the
patterns
of
prudence
and
quietude
was
not
after
the
two
appearances
of
bantom
altogether
disturbed
at
losing
the
two
young
girls
especially
as
they
had
from
the
first
declined
her
advances
repudiated
her
familiarity
and
had
at
no
time
been
seduced
by
her
into
the
sin
of
gossiping
she
knew
nothing
about
their
private
affairs
from
first
to
last
she
therefore
did
not
trouble
herself
to
inquire
whither
they
were
going
or
why
they
had
left
her
house
she
wished
if
anything
for
inquirers
if
there
happened
to
be
any
to
conclude
that
she
had
herself
given
them
warning
lotte
wrote
a
note
to
her
brother
charley
informing
him
that
she
had
quitted
her
apartments
but
that
she
had
at
present
a
motive
for
concealing
the
locality
to
which
she
had
moved
she
added
that
in
due
time
he
would
know
the
occasion
for
the
mystery
surrounding
her
movements
and
she
called
upon
him
to
have
the
same
strong
faith
in
her
truth
and
virtue
which
he
had
hitherto
entertained
and
to
which
she
felt
she
was
and
always
would
be
justly
entitled
she
appended
a
postscript
that
of
course
it
was
affectionate
heartily
loving
in
fact
but
it
was
worded
so
mysteriously
as
to
cause
him
the
pain
of
forming
some
horrible
surmises
and
conjectures
and
it
carried
him
to
the
abandoned
residence
but
he
could
learn
only
that
she
together
with
her
companion
her
bird
and
her
flowers
had
left
the
house
without
leaving
any
clue
even
to
the
direction
which
she
had
taken
after
racking
his
brain
for
a
motive
for
his
strange
conduct
or
a
suggestion
which
might
help
him
to
trace
her
out
it
occurred
to
him
that
harry
vivian
might
be
able
to
furnish
him
with
some
intelligence
respecting
her
inexplicable
flight
lotte
in
fervent
language
had
acquainted
him
with
the
services
hal
had
rendered
her
in
the
perilous
moment
when
house
was
in
flames
as
well
as
later
when
he
suddenly
met
with
her
and
saved
her
from
destruction
charley
was
quite
aware
also
from
subsequent
circumstances
that
vivian
had
expressed
a
friendly
anxiety
for
future
welfare
and
had
betrayed
an
interest
in
her
well
being
and
doing
since
she
had
been
at
her
late
abode
it
was
not
improbable
that
on
comparing
notes
with
him
vivian
might
be
able
to
bring
to
light
some
matter
which
would
enable
the
brother
to
follow
and
to
find
his
sister
and
to
obtain
from
her
some
better
reasons
for
her
remarkable
conduct
than
her
note
to
him
contained
the
premises
at
clerkenwell
were
closed
and
he
made
his
way
to
highbury
strange
events
still
son
the
absent
and
unregretted
had
returned
home
a
wild
profligate
and
outcast
he
was
in
years
gone
by
when
he
quitted
in
ignominious
flight
his
roof
and
the
land
that
gave
him
birth
he
returned
a
ragged
dirty
discharged
soldier
from
the
east
india
service
discharged
too
in
disgrace
his
sudden
appearance
sufficiently
in
liquor
to
be
brutish
in
his
conduct
his
demand
to
be
received
and
to
make
his
house
his
home
a
drunken
mad
orgie
on
the
night
of
his
return
when
valuable
glass
pictures
ornaments
were
wantonly
and
recklessly
destroyed
produced
in
harper
a
fit
of
apoplexy
and
in
two
hours
he
was
a
corpse
it
was
during
the
outrageous
rioting
of
the
prodigal
son
that
harry
vivian
returned
home
from
harleydale
his
efforts
to
restrain
the
ruffian
from
his
acts
of
violence
ended
in
a
tremendous
struggle
between
the
two
during
which
the
younger
harper
swore
with
fearful
oaths
to
murder
his
antagonist
but
strength
prevailed
and
he
succeeded
in
forcing
him
to
the
ground
and
there
with
help
binding
him
so
firmly
that
he
could
do
no
further
mischief
they
then
conveyed
him
to
a
bed
upon
which
he
was
laid
to
sleep
off
his
drunkenness
but
he
continued
shouting
howling
and
blaspheming
for
a
greater
portion
of
the
night
until
exhausted
by
his
own
ravings
and
horrible
threats
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
the
horrors
of
that
night
slew
mr
harper
as
soon
as
his
son
robert
upon
returning
to
a
state
of
consciousness
from
his
drunken
sleep
was
informed
of
his
death
he
insisted
upon
being
relieved
from
his
gyves
and
only
partially
restored
to
sobriety
he
demanded
why
he
had
been
thus
secured
when
it
was
explained
to
him
by
a
workman
of
his
a
powerful
fellow
who
had
been
placed
to
watch
him
and
who
related
what
had
taken
place
in
strong
and
not
flattering
language
his
brow
fell
he
said
not
a
word
but
seemed
to
feel
ashamed
of
his
conduct
of
the
previous
night
he
asked
to
be
released
and
promised
not
to
be
guilty
of
like
conduct
especially
as
his
father
at
that
moment
lay
dead
in
the
house
when
he
descended
to
his
and
had
assured
himself
the
old
man
was
no
more
he
ascertained
from
his
prostrate
weeping
mother
the
name
of
his
solicitor
and
his
address
on
pretence
of
making
the
necessary
arrangements
consequent
upon
the
unhappy
event
which
had
happened
at
an
interview
with
this
solicitor
he
elicited
that
so
far
as
he
knew
harper
had
made
no
will
at
least
his
professional
services
had
not
been
called
in
to
execute
one
in
fact
the
latter
said
he
had
often
urged
upon
his
client
the
importance
and
the
necessity
of
making
a
proper
disposition
of
his
worldly
affairs
but
those
urgings
had
never
been
attended
to
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
with
the
proper
success
robert
harper
thanked
him
told
him
he
should
send
him
notice
to
be
present
at
the
funeral
and
made
his
way
to
the
manufactory
where
as
he
expected
he
found
vivian
in
a
few
brief
bitter
words
he
informed
hal
of
the
death
of
his
uncle
his
generous
patron
his
unfailing
friend
harper
had
been
seized
with
apoplexy
and
had
expired
after
hal
had
left
highbury
at
dawn
that
morning
robert
gazed
with
an
insolent
air
of
triumph
upon
the
shocked
white
features
of
hal
who
stood
transfixed
like
a
statue
and
he
said
to
him
master
here
now
i
suppose
you
know
that
if
you
soon
make
you
know
it
the
old
gone
off
and
left
no
will
behind
him
do
you
know
that
because
if
you
you
will
know
it
from
this
time
and
be
made
to
know
it
too
i
am
the
heir
and
sole
master
of
all
here
now
last
night
you
assumed
some
mighty
fine
airs
and
if
it
that
a
parcel
of
fools
might
be
talking
i
would
give
you
such
a
thrashing
now
that
you
be
able
to
crawl
for
a
month
there
is
one
thing
i
can
do
and
that
i
will
do
see
i
am
master
get
out
of
here
come
be
off
at
once
or
kick
you
out
beggar
if
you
fancy
you
have
any
claim
upon
me
go
to
law
for
it
i
can
stand
that
you
have
a
farthing
from
me
any
other
way
been
king
of
the
castle
here
too
long
so
be
off
beggarly
upstart
he
extended
his
arm
to
push
young
vivian
to
the
door
but
the
latter
turned
to
him
with
a
glittering
eye
and
a
lip
which
trembled
with
intense
emotion
not
lay
a
hand
upon
me
he
said
in
low
but
emphatic
tones
i
will
fell
you
to
the
earth
i
would
not
in
memory
of
the
dear
and
noble
man
your
father
and
my
constant
benefactor
willingly
be
guilty
of
such
an
act
at
this
moment
but
the
horrible
consequence
of
your
last
frantic
bestiality
coupled
with
your
present
barbarous
behaviour
almost
drives
me
into
a
frenzy
of
desperation
it
wants
but
your
touch
to
thrust
me
into
madness
i
warn
you
to
let
me
pass
hence
without
another
word
or
robert
harper
had
had
a
too
lengthened
experience
in
physiognomy
not
to
be
able
to
interpret
the
expression
which
made
features
rigid
as
though
they
were
chiselled
in
marble
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
without
attempting
to
reply
harry
vivian
seized
his
hat
and
cloak
and
rushed
from
the
place
one
earnest
interview
he
sought
with
the
solicitor
who
had
so
long
conducted
affairs
in
which
that
gentleman
promised
to
protect
the
interests
of
harper
and
to
place
the
property
under
proper
seal
and
authority
so
that
robert
harper
could
not
commence
to
dissipate
it
in
wild
debauchery
before
it
was
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
there
was
no
will
and
then
to
highbury
we
pass
over
passionate
grief
at
the
bedside
of
his
deceased
relative
to
whom
he
was
so
fondly
and
warmly
attached
and
the
equally
sorrowful
interview
between
harper
and
him
during
which
her
agony
and
incoherence
occasioned
by
the
terrible
affliction
with
which
she
had
been
so
suddenly
visited
prevented
him
narrating
what
that
morning
had
taken
place
at
the
manufactory
or
telling
her
that
he
would
not
fail
to
watch
over
her
when
she
should
be
left
alone
with
her
son
subsequently
he
forwarded
a
claim
to
robert
harper
to
be
present
at
the
funeral
of
his
uncle
his
letter
was
returned
to
him
torn
in
two
halves
yet
he
was
present
at
the
solemn
ceremony
prayed
fervently
during
the
service
and
lingered
long
after
the
had
gone
that
he
might
stand
by
the
grave
and
pay
the
tribute
of
his
tears
and
the
last
sad
testimonies
of
his
loving
respect
for
the
departed
when
he
quitted
the
graveyard
it
was
no
more
to
return
to
the
house
which
had
sheltered
him
from
boyhood
these
were
the
facts
which
charley
clinton
partially
gathered
from
his
inquiries
at
highbury
and
as
no
one
knew
where
harry
vivian
was
now
to
be
found
he
had
to
turn
disappointedly
away
his
acute
intellect
was
not
however
to
be
so
easily
thwarted
the
very
nature
of
his
occupation
gave
a
tone
of
inquiry
to
his
mind
and
in
the
getting
up
of
evidence
on
which
service
he
had
been
frequently
employed
he
had
found
so
much
advantage
result
from
pushing
investigation
beyond
what
appeared
to
be
its
natural
limits
that
he
resolved
not
to
pause
at
the
point
he
had
now
reached
often
what
we
seek
is
to
be
found
in
places
where
we
deem
it
least
likely
to
be
situated
charley
knew
this
and
he
cast
about
for
some
other
acquaintance
or
friend
of
who
might
be
able
to
drop
even
a
hint
upon
which
he
could
act
he
thought
eventually
of
miss
wilton
and
at
once
made
his
way
to
the
park
to
see
whether
the
family
was
in
town
if
not
he
determined
to
write
as
soon
as
he
reached
his
lodgings
having
absolutely
no
claim
to
insist
on
seeing
miss
wilton
if
she
were
to
be
denied
to
him
presuming
that
she
was
at
the
town
house
he
determined
upon
his
mode
of
proceeding
by
an
accident
he
mistook
residence
for
and
commenced
those
operations
upon
the
porter
there
which
were
intended
for
the
functionary
next
door
he
was
skilled
and
successful
whelks
being
called
into
the
conference
and
it
was
resolved
that
clinton
should
see
youngest
daughter
the
eldest
being
from
home
and
the
next
at
the
opera
with
her
mamma
charley
had
explained
that
his
business
was
of
importance
and
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
any
charitable
institution
or
case
of
urgent
distress
recommended
by
the
vicar
of
his
parish
therefore
it
was
considered
that
a
few
words
with
miss
evangeline
who
after
all
was
not
looked
upon
as
holding
any
position
in
the
family
could
result
in
nothing
likely
to
turn
out
unpleasant
to
the
parties
paid
to
effect
the
interview
accordingly
charles
clinton
and
evangeline
grahame
were
brought
face
to
face
he
was
a
little
embarrassed
at
first
but
when
he
began
to
explain
that
he
came
to
put
a
few
questions
to
her
which
he
hoped
she
would
be
able
to
answer
respecting
a
missing
young
lady
he
at
once
lost
his
embarrassment
and
grew
interested
in
observing
a
flush
mount
to
her
cheek
and
her
eyes
glisten
while
in
earnestness
she
rested
her
small
hand
upon
his
arm
and
looked
up
into
his
face
watching
his
countenance
and
listening
to
his
words
with
intense
avidity
she
did
not
notice
that
he
addressed
her
as
miss
wilton
but
when
he
mentioned
that
it
was
sister
who
was
missing
she
turned
from
him
with
an
air
of
grievous
disappointment
this
movement
produced
an
explanation
and
he
delicately
contrived
to
elicit
from
her
that
she
too
had
lost
a
sister
under
circumstances
no
less
strange
and
mysterious
than
those
attending
the
disappearance
of
lotte
while
she
was
speaking
the
remembrance
of
friend
the
companion
of
her
flight
flashed
across
his
mind
and
when
she
had
ceased
speaking
he
gave
a
rapid
sketch
of
her
person
to
evangeline
it
was
graphic
and
truthful
is
she
exclaimed
evangeline
clasping
her
hands
then
followed
a
thousand
questions
put
to
him
vehemently
the
date
the
day
the
dress
all
confirmed
her
supposition
but
his
answers
were
necessarily
limited
he
could
say
very
little
save
that
up
to
a
certain
time
a
young
lady
had
resided
with
his
sister
and
that
they
had
departed
somewhere
together
where
he
could
not
conjecture
but
was
now
engaged
in
endeavouring
to
ascertain
again
and
again
she
made
him
repeat
the
particulars
which
assured
her
that
helen
was
still
living
and
though
once
more
hiding
away
in
some
mysterious
she
was
nevertheless
neither
beyond
the
pale
of
discovery
nor
the
probability
of
being
communicated
with
visited
perhaps
restored
to
her
home
by
her
evangeline
oh
that
she
might
be
permitted
to
assist
in
the
search
for
her
she
suggested
this
very
very
earnestly
and
seemed
sadly
disconcerted
when
he
shook
his
head
was
there
no
portion
of
the
inquiry
in
which
she
could
take
part
was
there
no
species
of
aid
she
could
lend
ah
if
he
could
only
point
out
in
what
particular
her
services
would
be
useful
with
what
delight
she
would
render
them
he
gazed
earnestly
upon
her
features
me
he
said
suddenly
while
a
peculiar
expression
of
surprise
stole
over
his
face
fear
i
have
committed
some
mistake
if
you
are
the
sister
of
the
young
lady
lately
residing
with
mine
you
can
hardly
be
miss
wilton
or
surely
your
brother
mark
would
have
recognized
name
is
grahame
my
name
is
helen
grahame
i
have
no
brother
named
mark
responded
evangeline
naively
i
trust
you
will
pardon
my
intrusion
he
added
moving
as
if
about
to
retire
wilton
is
a
a
friend
of
my
though
a
stranger
to
me
and
i
hoped
that
i
should
from
her
obtain
some
desirable
pray
do
not
apologize
exclaimed
evangeline
with
a
air
seeming
to
feel
the
clue
to
her
sister
slipping
through
her
fingers
wilton
when
in
town
resides
in
the
next
dwelling
to
this
but
that
young
lady
with
her
papa
has
been
for
some
long
time
away
from
london
she
can
not
possibly
know
anything
about
miss
she
looked
at
his
card
sudden
departure
i
am
the
causes
which
have
led
to
it
he
asked
with
rather
a
marked
emphasis
she
gave
an
inquiring
look
into
his
face
and
said
told
me
you
had
a
letter
he
said
with
bitterness
written
as
to
acquaint
me
with
my
purposed
departure
to
drive
me
half
distracted
and
to
bid
me
live
upon
the
shadowy
hope
that
she
will
some
day
see
me
will
she
will
shall
she
must
i
will
not
rest
until
i
find
helen
with
her
be
sure
if
as
i
suppose
they
are
yet
are
surely
together
you
believe
they
are
together
do
you
not
my
honour
my
dear
young
lady
i
do
indeed
i
know
my
sister
lotte
so
well
that
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
she
is
plunging
into
some
mysterious
course
of
proceeding
to
favour
her
companion
and
friend
without
having
a
thought
or
reflection
upon
the
injury
it
may
do
sir
said
evangeline
tenderly
not
be
angry
with
your
sister
i
can
so
well
appreciate
and
sympathise
with
conduct
such
as
hers
if
it
should
prove
that
for
sake
she
has
incurred
your
displeasure
and
the
cold
censure
i
will
love
her
and
take
her
to
my
heart
and
be
a
fond
affectionate
friend
if
she
will
permit
me
to
charley
here
very
nearly
gravely
committed
himself
he
was
in
the
habit
when
lotte
gave
utterance
to
sentiments
which
chimed
with
his
best
feelings
to
seize
her
round
the
waist
press
her
to
his
breast
and
kiss
her
forehead
the
words
which
had
just
fallen
from
the
lips
of
evangeline
were
uttered
in
such
a
soft
tone
and
evinced
so
much
kindness
and
gentleness
of
nature
that
upon
the
impulse
he
was
about
to
seize
her
and
go
through
the
usual
performance
when
she
spoke
again
and
brought
him
back
to
a
recollection
of
the
presence
in
which
he
stood
me
implore
you
she
exclaimed
with
much
warmth
of
manner
abstain
from
judging
your
dear
sister
unkindly
until
you
are
actually
in
possession
of
the
true
facts
which
have
influenced
her
actions
it
is
sir
so
easy
to
conjecture
in
a
defaming
spirit
so
impossible
to
make
reparation
for
the
wound
an
unjust
accusation
inflicts
upon
an
innocent
and
honest
heart
i
pray
you
therefore
to
forbear
judging
her
until
you
can
justly
claim
the
title
to
do
charley
felt
extremely
gratified
by
what
fell
from
lips
no
more
complete
illustration
of
his
real
feelings
could
have
been
given
even
by
himself
and
he
expressed
himself
with
some
fervour
in
reply
preparing
to
take
his
leave
he
promised
to
relax
no
effort
likely
to
enable
him
to
discover
the
secret
abode
of
the
two
fugitives
a
problem
now
gravely
presented
itself
evangeline
was
and
would
be
devoured
by
an
intense
anxiety
to
learn
any
tidings
connected
with
her
sister
helen
and
a
firm
conclusion
that
in
future
charles
clinton
must
be
the
medium
through
whom
it
was
to
be
settled
itself
in
her
mind
but
how
charles
clinton
was
a
stranger
to
her
family
he
was
unentitled
to
visit
them
if
he
wrote
to
her
her
letters
would
be
opened
before
they
reached
her
either
by
her
mamma
or
by
her
sister
margaret
as
the
family
save
herself
had
by
common
consent
forborne
to
mention
her
sister
name
and
even
to
think
of
her
as
one
dead
she
arrived
at
a
conviction
that
no
letter
written
by
charles
clinton
containing
matter
connected
with
helen
would
ever
be
permitted
to
reach
her
what
was
to
be
done
to
both
it
appeared
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
settle
the
question
they
could
meet
in
some
retired
spot
at
periods
agreed
upon
at
each
meeting
at
these
interviews
charles
would
recount
his
labours
and
report
progress
evangeline
would
be
able
to
gratify
the
wish
nearest
her
heart
by
being
brought
nearer
to
communion
with
her
sister
and
probably
to
win
her
back
to
peace
happiness
and
her
home
no
sense
of
the
impropriety
of
such
clandestine
meetings
occurred
to
either
charles
clinton
had
no
thought
of
wrong
had
station
been
far
humbler
than
his
own
he
would
have
met
her
treated
her
with
the
respectful
deference
due
from
man
to
virtue
and
innocence
would
have
protected
her
if
she
needed
his
brave
defence
and
have
restored
her
to
her
home
as
pure
as
when
she
first
put
her
full
trust
in
his
honour
evangeline
knew
so
little
of
evil
she
saw
none
in
taking
this
step
her
relatives
were
all
frigid
and
harshly
repellant
to
her
helen
had
been
cold
to
her
too
but
at
times
she
had
displayed
a
passionate
fondness
for
her
and
those
ebullitions
of
fondness
had
appeared
when
they
were
and
could
only
be
evidences
of
heart
emotions
and
it
was
these
evident
impulses
which
made
evangeline
know
that
a
fire
of
affection
glowed
beneath
the
icy
surface
and
to
love
her
therefore
no
trouble
had
been
taken
to
instil
and
graft
upon
her
innocent
nature
a
full
and
perfect
system
of
she
therefore
arranged
with
charles
clinton
for
their
first
meeting
in
the
most
guileless
faith
in
his
honour
in
the
most
implicit
trustfulness
in
the
expediency
of
the
step
she
purposed
taking
the
end
being
good
and
charitable
and
in
perfect
unconsciousness
of
the
consequences
likely
to
result
from
a
series
of
clandestine
meetings
between
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
and
a
very
frank
young
fellow
they
were
in
an
apartment
upon
the
ground
floor
whose
windows
opened
and
gave
egress
to
a
lawn
conducting
to
a
gravelled
path
in
the
garden
they
had
named
the
place
the
day
the
hour
they
were
to
meet
when
charles
was
to
report
to
her
how
far
his
search
was
to
prove
successful
evangeline
had
just
innocently
placed
her
hand
in
his
as
he
was
bidding
her
farewell
when
a
shadow
fell
upon
the
pair
both
looked
up
startled
they
beheld
before
them
a
young
man
whose
form
was
concealed
by
a
cloak
but
whose
face
was
white
and
haggard
evangeline
uttered
a
faint
scream
and
instinctively
drew
close
to
charles
for
protection
the
stranger
observed
the
surprise
of
one
and
the
affright
of
the
other
not
alarmed
he
cried
in
a
low
hurried
tone
have
no
sinister
motive
i
swear
before
heaven
though
i
appear
thus
strangely
before
you
miss
i
would
have
one
word
with
you
for
mercy
sake
do
not
deny
evangeline
shrank
still
closer
to
charles
in
evident
alarm
the
latter
instantly
said
sharply
sir
who
you
are
and
why
you
appear
here
in
this
abrupt
and
strange
the
stranger
made
him
no
reply
but
clasping
his
hands
he
stretched
them
towards
evangeline
and
said
in
tones
of
suffering
and
anxiety
is
helen
tell
me
only
where
is
helen
i
have
heard
that
she
is
gone
fled
hence
in
secret
oh
tell
me
only
whither
she
has
gone
that
i
may
but
see
her
once
again
you
are
young
and
your
heart
can
not
be
made
of
adamant
tell
me
in
pity
tell
me
where
is
helen
a
thousand
thoughts
careered
wildly
through
the
brain
of
evangeline
who
was
this
man
what
had
he
to
do
with
flight
was
he
the
cause
she
turned
deathly
white
and
faint
she
burst
into
tears
the
stranger
still
with
clasped
hands
sank
upon
his
knees
before
her
murmuring
with
intense
excitement
it
true
that
she
is
gone
evangeline
wrung
her
hands
and
could
not
speak
has
fled
from
home
said
charles
fled
alone
cried
the
stranger
to
him
eagerly
did
replied
charles
where
in
mercy
tell
me
that
have
yet
to
learn
it
is
my
purpose
to
search
for
and
if
possible
to
find
she
in
london
think
you
she
is
in
london
believe
nay
i
am
convinced
of
that
replied
charles
emphatically
bless
you
cried
the
stranger
wildly
more
i
shall
see
her
for
london
has
no
secret
spot
i
will
not
narrowly
examine
until
i
have
found
her
the
whole
world
shall
not
keep
her
from
with
these
words
he
rushed
from
the
room
by
the
way
he
had
entered
with
if
possible
increased
wildness
of
manner
leaving
charles
astounded
and
evangeline
yet
frightened
and
weeping
charles
endeavoured
to
restore
eva
to
a
degree
of
composure
by
suggesting
that
the
remarkable
event
which
had
just
happened
might
perhaps
afford
a
clue
to
the
sudden
flight
from
home
of
her
sister
but
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence
a
tremendous
knock
at
the
resounded
through
the
building
father
faintly
cried
evangeline
and
like
a
startled
fawn
ran
from
charles
to
her
own
room
he
advanced
to
the
door
feeling
his
cheek
burn
fiercely
and
wholly
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
the
haughty
owner
of
the
mansion
the
was
flung
back
wide
he
heard
the
shuffling
of
feet
a
rapid
step
ascend
the
stairs
and
then
a
door
banged
loudly
the
next
instant
whelks
stood
by
his
side
he
said
in
a
whisper
and
added
with
a
grin
you
like
to
see
in
the
charles
shook
his
head
with
a
degree
of
energy
indicative
of
the
strength
of
the
negative
he
wished
to
convey
and
slipped
a
shilling
into
the
hand
of
whelks
as
an
additional
contribution
it
happened
to
be
a
new
one
felt
thick
and
crisp
whelks
slid
it
into
his
pocket
under
the
impression
that
it
was
a
sovereign
he
laid
his
finger
upon
the
side
of
his
nose
shall
know
you
when
you
come
again
sir
he
whispered
at
home
sir
you
shall

good
charley
stood
once
more
in
the
park
alone
the
stars
shone
brightly
above
him
he
had
certainly
met
with
a
remarkable
adventure
but
where
was
lotte
he
was
no
nearer
to
the
object
with
which
he
came
there
than
he
was

shakspere
nathan
gomer
reached
the
door
of
the
chamber
of
flora
wilton
and
paused
he
looked
about
him
up
the
corridor
and
down
the
corridor
and
then
stooping
down
he
peeped
through
the
keyhole
he
uttered
an
exclamation
not
of
joy
he
pressed
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
and
looked
once
more
up
and
down
the
corridor
and
then
gently
opening
chamber
door
he
glided
within
closed
it
after
him
and
stood
for
a
moment
and
gazed
upon
the
prostrate
girl
a
tear
twinkled
in
both
eyes
he
brushed
them
sharply
away
flora
my
child
he
whispered
yet
loud
enough
for
her
to
hear
though
his
step
had
been
noiseless
and
her
grief
was
still
in
its
intensity
he
bent
over
her
and
raised
her
up
with
eyes
red
and
swimming
in
tears
she
turned
her
feeble
gaze
upon
him
and
could
not
in
spite
of
her
anguish
repress
an
exclamation
of
surprise
at
seeing
the
strange
looking
benefactor
of
her
father
before
her
she
attempted
to
efface
the
traces
of
her
tears
and
to
speak
but
the
task
was
not
so
easily
to
be
accomplished
nathan
perceived
her
intention
and
its
result
and
in
a
voice
agitated
and
slightly
husky
he
said
to
her
mind
me
pretty
one
mind
me
i
know
all
make
no
struggle
with
your
grief
on
my
account
i
say
make
it
for
me
and
when
you
have
exhausted
yourself
and
feel
very
ill
as
you
will
if
you
go
on
in
this
fashion
i
think
i
may
say
that
you
will
then
take
for
comfort
you
can
now
if
you
like
my
assurance
that
you
may
rely
on
me
as
a
friend
and
all
shall
yet
go
well
i
say
i
think
you
may
rely
on
me
i
know
whither
your
heart
has
travelled
and
where
it
resteth
i
have
vowed
to
secure
your
happiness
flora
i
say
your
happiness
and
it
is
not
wealth
that
gives
happiness
i
think
i
know
that
i
believe
i
may
say
i
do
know
that
you
shall
be
happy
yet
pretty
one
if
you
will
be
flora
turned
gratefully
towards
him
she
knew
that
he
possessed
inexplicable
power
and
seemed
to
be
able
to
produce
results
according
to
his
pleasure
and
she
felt
that
for
him
to
say
that
in
this
affair
of
the
heart
he
would
stand
her
friend
was
almost
tantamount
considering
the
extraordinary
influence
he
possessed
over
her
father
to
placing
her
hand
in
before
the
she
bent
her
sweet
eyes
upon
him
gratefully
can
i
thank
you
she
said
in
a
low
tone
me
he
cried
with
a
grin
must
wait
before
you
do
that
i
say
you
should
never
be
premature
with
thanks
you
should
always
wait
until
the
promise
is
redeemed
and
you
are
benefited
to
your
wish
then
thank
promises
are
slippery
things
i
say
promises
sometimes
are
not
fulfilled
thank
me
my
dear
child
when
you
feel
supremely
happy
through
my
he
turned
his
back
to
her
pressed
his
two
hands
together
beneath
his
chin
and
gazed
heavenwards
shall
be
he
murmured
providence
you
shall
flora
could
not
help
regarding
him
with
a
strange
mixture
of
reverence
and
dread
reverence
for
he
had
been
known
only
to
her
as
a
great
benefactor
to
the
family
and
with
dread
because
he
was
so
singular
in
his
outward
form
and
appeared
at
such
remarkable
moments
and
in
so
strange
a
manner
he
turned
again
to
her
apparently
he
read
the
expression
of
her
features
for
a
pleased
smile
lighted
up
his
features
and
he
tapped
her
gently
and
pleasantly
on
the
shoulder
come
he
said
up
those
tears
and
look
cheerful
i
have
said
all
shall
go
as
you
wish
it
it
shall
i
have
now
an
agreeable
surprise
for
you
so
you
pop
on
your
bonnet
and
make
your
way
into
the
garden
and
pace
by
the
side
of
the
fountain
until
my
surprise
comes
and
startles
pray
you
to
excuse
me
sir
said
flora
faltering
i
have
no
strength
to
leave
this
chamber
just
spirit
either
i
fancy
he
observed
with
his
peculiar
grin
she
did
not
reply
and
he
went
on
you
must
have
your
surprise
here
then
i
suppose
it
wears
a
hat
a
coat
and
trousers
it
is
bronzed
with
the
sun
in
the
face
it
went
away
in
years
gone
by
without
a
word
to
family
or
friends
roamed
over
seas
and
strange
almost
screamed
flora
home
laconically
replied
nathan
flora
staggered
to
a
seat
and
looked
as
if
she
would
faint
her
nostrils
were
inflated
and
she
breathed
short
and
quick
cried
nathan
growing
frightened
at
her
aspect
up
your
courage
he
is
well
hearty
happy
longing
to
see
you
shall
i
send
him
to
you
moment
gasped
flora
my
heart
aches
and
i
feel
sick
and
faint
until
he
again
folds
his
loving
arms
about
me
nathan
blew
his
nose
and
coughed
shall
be
here
in
a
in
five
minutes
he
said
after
two
or
three
efforts
to
clear
his
throat
send
him
never
fear
i
think
i
said
five
minutes
that
will
give
you
time
to
prepare
yourself
remember
no
more
tears
all
will
yet
go
well
i
have
said
he
hurried
from
the
room
as
he
spoke
and
though
he
knew
that
mark
and
hal
were
together
he
contrived
to
keep
his
word
and
it
was
so
far
well
that
he
did
inasmuch
that
mark
after
a
somewhat
lengthened
interview
with
his
sister
immediately
sought
out
hal
in
the
village
to
which
he
had
retired
and
remained
with
him
until
he
took
the
train
for
london
and
then
he
parted
with
him
on
the
most
friendly
terms
during
absence
nathan
gomer
presented
himself
before
old
wilton
who
received
him
with
the
same
eagerness
and
respect
he
had
always
previously
displayed
colonel
mires
who
was
having
a
with
his
host
took
the
opportunity
which
the
coming
of
nathan
gomer
afforded
him
to
retire
to
brood
over
dark
projects
for
the
future
nathan
looked
after
him
like
him
he
muttered
in
him
got
some
purpose
haunting
him
and
he
will
try
to
execute
it
too
i
say
he
will
make
the
attempt
must
look
after
do
you
say
asked
wilton
trying
to
catch
his
words
for
your
ear
replied
nathan
a
little
tartly
have
a
bad
habit
of
talking
while
i
am
thinking
foolish
that
i
may
venture
to
say
that
it
is
a
very
foolish
wilton
responded
and
then
nathan
gomer
drawing
a
chair
near
to
him
sat
down
and
at
once
proceeded
to
business
he
circumstantially
and
clearly
related
all
the
incidents
which
had
transpired
in
connection
with
josh
maybee
even
to
the
trick
which
he
had
himself
played
chewkle
and
he
assured
him
that
the
missing
documents
were
all
secured
and
in
safe
possession
arrangements
also
he
informed
him
had
been
completed
with
maybee
who
had
a
rightful
share
in
the
property
the
only
thing
he
waited
for
was
to
know
what
course
was
to
be
pursued
with
respect
to
grahame
who
was
now
entirely
in
their
power
features
assumed
a
hard
grim
expression
his
eyeballs
contracted
into
small
glittering
circles
he
fastened
them
upon
the
brilliant
orbs
of
nathan
gomer
mercy
he
growled
through
his
clenched
teeth
must
be
coughed
nathan
gomer
eh
wilton
echoed
wilton
with
a
hiss
do
you
think
i
can
forget
the
years
of
grinding
torturing
poverty
he
has
caused
me
do
you
think
i
can
wipe
out
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
the
recollection
of
the
last
effort
of
his
accursed
cupidity
the
act
which
tore
me
from
my
children
and
hurried
me
to
the
horrors
of
a
prison
nathan
nathan
he
cried
clutching
at
his
wrist
and
speaking
in
a
low
guttural
tone
an
evidence
of
the
depth
of
the
emotion
under
which
he
laboured
i
consign
his
acts
to
oblivion
when
i
look
round
these
walls
when
i
pace
these
chambers
when
i
wander
in
the
grounds
yonder
among
the
flowers
and
the
trees
and
miss
companionship
her
gentle
presence
who
made
this
abode
a
paradise
whose
absence
shrouds
it
in
intense
gloom
no
no
almost
groaned
nathan
shrouding
his
eyes
with
his
hands
reigned
here
a
queen
of
light
of
joy
the
music
of
her
voice
the
magic
of
her
sweet
and
tender
beaming
eyes
made
harleydale
a
heaven
was
she
not
thrust
from
hence
was
she
not
crammed
into
a
den
of
wretchedness
into
a
foul
impure
atmosphere
compelled
to
endure
privation
want
rags
by
whom
by
whom
answer
me
that
i
had
earlier
known
whither
you
had
transported
yourselves
when
you
quitted
this
moaned
nathan
evidently
in
anguish
at
the
picture
wilton
was
placing
before
his
eyes
it
not
grahame
continued
wilton
fiercely
he
not
juggle
me
out
of
my
signature
to
bonds
that
he
might
utterly
destroy
me
when
he
knew
that
she
a
very
flower
cultured
only
in
the
tenderest
carefulness
sheltered
from
the
ruder
atmosphere
of
human
society
had
been
suddenly
hurled
where
the
blasts
of
poverty
and
degradation
were
blighting
her
making
her
pine
fade
droop
away
out
of
life
she
my
soul
my
spirit
the
immortal
part
of
my
being
who
having
gone
from
me
leaves
this
frame
a
machine
this
world
an
expanse
of
murky
mist
penetrated
with
only
one
gleam
that
bright
spot
in
futurity
when
released
from
this
miserable
shackle
this
valueless
body
i
shall
join
her
angel
spirit
did
he
not
slay
her
curse
him
did
he
not
destroy
her
with
his
damned
impenitent
obduracy
does
not
her
spirit
shriek
for
revenge
wilton
flung
his
arms
up
in
the
air
and
almost
screamed
these
last
words
nathan
gomer
rose
up
and
in
a
tone
of
solemnity
which
thrilled
through
frame
exclaimed
he
paused
for
a
moment
convulsed
with
emotion
then
he
proceeded
gentle
spirit
never
harboured
such
a
sentiment
she
left
to
god
the
exaction
of
atonement
your
wrongs
which
made
her
a
sufferer
did
not
extort
from
her
a
single
wish
for
retribution
you
know
it
wilton
she
felt
the
loss
of
the
bright
clear
air
the
waving
trees
the
open
hills
the
flowery
vales
deeply
but
it
was
because
you
were
thrust
from
them
because
those
gentle
tributes
of
her
love
for
you
were
reared
in
a
sickly
atmosphere
instead
of
the
healthy
happy
home
of
which
they
were
unjustly
deprived
she
sorrowed
for
them
she
pined
to
see
your
waning
health
she
faded
drooped
died
for
she
had
not
been
gifted
with
the
power
to
drag
out
existence
in
such
a
sphere
as
that
to
which
you
all
were
doomed
she
hoped
she
prayed
for
the
time
when
she
might
see
all
restored
to
this
fair
place
again
she
knew
and
felt
acutely
the
wrong
which
kept
you
from
it
but
the
wickedness
of
a
bad
man
never
drew
from
her
lips
a
curse
nor
raised
within
her
breast
a
wish
or
desire
for
a
remorseless
revenge
her
spirit
was
too
angelic
too
pure
too
good
oh
wilton
wilton
her
loss
is
indeed
dreadful
nathan
pressed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
hurried
to
the
end
of
the
room
followed
by
the
wondering
gaze
of
wilton
whose
intense
and
bitter
rage
against
grahame
changed
into
intense
astonishment
at
what
had
fallen
from
his
lips
what
knew
he
of
her
who
had
gone
from
them
to
the
what
entitled
him
thus
to
describe
and
enlarge
upon
her
sweet
unavenging
nature
when
where
how
had
known
having
mastered
his
feelings
nathan
returned
to
the
table
wearing
to
surprise
his
usual
aspect
wilton
rapidly
put
the
above
questions
to
him
nathan
waved
his
hand
explanation
wilton
he
said
coldly
keep
until
a
future
day
let
us
return
to
the
purpose
in
hand
grahame
is
neck
and
ankles
in
your
power
it
is
for
you
to
determine
what
shall
be
again
the
passion
for
revenge
animated
the
breast
of
old
wilton
would
not
have
spared
me
he
ejaculated
in
a
guttural
tone
right
has
he
to
expect
mercy
at
my
hands
when
he
would
have
shown
none
to
me
had
his
machinations
proved
successful
is
beside
the
question
wilton
it
is
in
your
power
now
to
have
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
or
in
a
spirit
of
grand
magnanimity
to
return
good
for
evil
make
your
wilton
leaned
over
the
table
and
in
the
same
fiercely
vindictive
tone
he
growled
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
i
will
exact
all
i
nathan
paced
the
room
with
rather
long
strides
and
returning
again
sat
down
plan
he
said
laconically
arrangements
with
grahame
in
respect
to
the
division
of
the
estates
are
not
are
shall
not
be
you
hold
his
promissory
notes
o
capable
of
being
demanded
at
any
sums
you
have
advanced
are
large
you
insist
on
their
being
paid
instanter
what
will
be
the
result
to
him
and
irretrievable
nathan
beggary
most
abject
beggary
and
imprisonment
as
well
for
the
property
he
once
owned
is
so
deeply
mortgaged
that
not
a
farthing
will
be
available
to
pay
my
new
claims
upon
wilton
compressed
his
hands
together
his
family
his
proud
haughty
family
nathan
what
of
them
must
necessarily
be
thrown
on
the
world
wholly
wilton
rubbed
his
hands
with
savage
pleasure
are
his
mortgagees
do
you
know
their
names
and
addresses
he
asked
in
a
hissing
whisper
am
the
only
mortgagee
responded
nathan
almost
proudly
and
yet
coldly
must
transfer
all
the
debts
and
mortgages
to
me
cried
wilton
with
an
exulting
laugh
then
i
alone
shall
hold
complete
power
over
him
then
he
shall
be
made
to
feel
the
clanging
beating
of
the
brain
the
dead
booming
of
the
heart
the
sickness
of
hopeless
despair
the
shrinking
cowering
of
the
spirit
which
they
feel
who
have
been
hurled
from
a
high
estate
with
heavy
soul
to
drink
the
dregs
of
poverty
i
must
have
the
mortgages
the
i
o
all
all
all
said
nathan
with
a
gloom
hanging
on
his
brow
are
mine
obtained
after
long
long
hard
struggles
i
shall
retain
them
i
too
have
a
purpose
to
serve
though
even
in
this
i
act
for
another
he
raised
his
eyes
upward
then
he
added
hastily
proud
ambitious
man
must
be
punished
but
the
mode
of
his
punishment
must
after
all
i
see
be
left
to
wilton
with
feverish
animation
urged
his
point
but
nathan
gomer
was
not
to
be
moved
and
the
result
of
the
conference
was
that
wilton
to
his
deep
mortification
was
compelled
to
leave
in
the
hands
of
nathan
the
entire
management
of
the
recovery
of
the
estates
and
the
punishment
of
his
implacable
foe
incidentally
nathan
alluded
to
intention
with
respect
to
flora
and
listened
quietly
to
a
recapitulation
of
what
he
had
overheard
as
well
as
to
renewed
expressions
of
determination
that
nothing
should
turn
him
from
the
decision
at
which
he
had
arrived
nathan
gomer
made
no
further
comment
upon
it
than
to
advise
him
to
send
away
lester
vane
for
the
present
and
to
let
the
affair
remain
in
abeyance
until
he
was
put
into
possession
of
the
estates
of
which
he
had
been
so
long
deprived
to
which
advice
wilton
assented
it
was
immediately
following
this
interview
that
grahame
received
a
letter
from
nathan
gomer
it
was
placed
in
his
hands
as
he
entered
his
house
on
the
night
of
charles
interview
with
evangeline
he
knew
the
handwriting
at
a
glance
he
snatched
it
from
the
hand
of
whelks
he
forbade
him
to
follow
and
he
hurried
almost
raced
up
the
staircase
to
his
library
he
locked
his
door
on
entering
the
room
and
flung
the
letter
on
the
table
while
he
raised
the
faint
light
of
the
lamp
to
a
brilliant
glare
do
not
like
the
look
of
that
note
he
exclaimed
hate
the
handwriting
it
is
always
the
harbinger
of
intelligence
which
wrings
my
heart
so
that
i
could
shriek
with
pain
why
is
it
that
i
have
some
spell
hanging
over
me
a
species
of
curse
that
embitters
every
joy
i
try
to
make
my
own
it
is
strange
that
in
my
securest
moments
i
should
ever
have
some
accursed
thing
to
intervene
and
show
me
the
rotten
foundation
of
my
assumptions
one
fact
however
i
am
now
at
least
certain
of
shall
not
die
a
and
to
confess
the
truth
it
is
an
end
i
much
he
took
up
the
letter
and
held
it
to
the
light
he
examined
the
superscription
and
then
the
seal
at
last
with
a
hasty
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
read
the
missing
link
which
so
long
prevented
wilton
proving
his
rightful
title
to
the
eglinton
estates
has
at
length
been
discovered
solicitor
has
at
this
moment
in
his
possession
all
the
documents
essential
to
the
prosecution
of
his
claim
wilton
has
in
consequence
refused
to
complete
the
arrangements
which
were
commenced
for
a
division
of
that
large
property
between
you
and
him
you
will
therefore
perceive
that
the
immediate
return
of
the
sums
advanced
by
me
to
you
in
accordance
with
our
agreement
will
be
necessary
to
prevent
my
commencing
an
action
for
the
recovery
i
have
the
honour
to
remain
sir
your
obedient
servant
grahame
read
every
word
in
the
letter
clearly
and
distinctly
the
first
time
the
second
time
he
perused
it
his
thoughts
of
the
future
thronged
in
his
brain
and
mixed
themselves
up
with
the
words
he
tried
to
read
it
a
third
time
but
the
lines
waved
up
and
down
the
letters
commingled
he
threw
it
from
him
and
sank
into
his
chair
he
pressed
his
aching
temples
with
his
hands
they
burned
and
throbbed
violently
and
he
tried
to
think
what
would
be
the
first
step
to
be
pursued
he
saw
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
write
to
nathan
gomer
at
once
and
stave
him
off
for
a
time
with
promises
he
knew
that
if
he
did
not
answer
his
letter
he
would
commence
to
sue
him
without
further
notice
his
next
step
was
to
send
for
chewkle
and
consult
with
him
he
had
quite
expected
that
according
to
promise
maybee
had
been
disposed
of
but
he
felt
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
to
speculate
when
action
was
essential
chewkle
had
given
to
him
necessary
information
how
to
communicate
with
him
when
he
wished
to
do
so
and
he
adopted
the
mode
with
which
he
had
been
furnished
the
letter
to
gomer
was
dispatched
and
chewkle
was
communicated
with
but
as
the
latter
was
not
in
london
a
week
elapsed
before
he
made
his
appearance
by
arrangement
he
adopted
the
same
mode
of
entry
as
before
and
made
his
way
into
the
library
by
night
from
the
garden
he
was
not
sorry
to
avail
himself
of
this
plan
because
it
was
not
his
wish
for
several
reasons
that
nathan
gomer
should
become
acquainted
with
his
presence
in
london
grahame
when
assured
that
they
were
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
laid
letter
before
chewkle
the
first
three
lines
were
enough
for
chewkle
he
slapped
his
thigh
and
with
an
oath
exclaimed
got
the
best
me
said
grahame
anxiously
but
chewkle
could
not
explain
his
roguery
prevented
him
doing
that
he
evaded
the
question
by
saying
mind
that
now
explain
how
done
me
at
the
proper
he
saw
at
once
that
nathan
gomer
had
extracted
from
him
in
some
way
a
clue
to
josh
maybee
and
had
honoured
him
chewkle
with
a
commission
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
while
he
obtained
possession
of
the
prize
possession
he
paused
at
the
word
the
prison
had
possession
of
maybee
nathan
gomer
with
all
his
cunning
and
artifice
he
believed
could
not
juggle
him
out
of
that
place
for
he
had
been
incarcerated
at
the
order
of
the
court
of
chancery
and
he
knew
that
the
detainer
at
the
gate
was
not
to
be
paid
off
a
long
and
tedious
process
in
chancery
he
believed
must
be
gone
through
before
the
release
of
maybee
could
be
effected
sulphur
phiz
get
him
out
of
there
he
soliloquised
he
might
have
been
able
to
get
of
and
gammon
a
good
deal
out
of
it
may
not
be
altogether
too
late
now
maybee
has
a
weakness
for
beer
and
i
knows
what
to
drop
in
his
pewter
to
keep
him
from
going
into
any
court
law
anywhere
but
to
six
foot
by
ten
of
grahame
bent
his
gaze
firmly
upon
light
gray
eyes
he
contracted
his
brows
and
spoke
only
in
whispers
but
they
were
painfully
audible
and
had
a
strange
harsh
sound
which
was
disagreeable
and
discordant
even
to
the
not
ear
of
chewkle
he
said
time
over
the
poor
wretch
in
prison
let
him
live
on
he
has
given
up
the
documents
his
presence
in
court
will
be
but
of
secondary
importance
now
my
bold
and
skilful
friend
chewkle
if
the
principal
dies
if
wilton
was
to
be
found
dead
i
as
i
have
before
intimated
to
you
become
beyond
all
dispute
possessor
of
the
property
do
you
not
understand
chewkle
gave
a
nod
is
an
old
man
feeble
with
no
physical
strength
continued
graliame
laying
his
hand
on
rather
muscular
arm
chewkle
nodded
again
know
where
he
dwells
harleydale
manor
know
it
said
chewkle
is
fond
of
walking
in
the
evening
chewkle
now
an
old
man
may
drop
down
in
a
wood
and
die
in
an
apoplectic
fit
or
fall
over
some
of
the
hanging
rocks
which
are
on
the
estate
there
are
many
ways
a
man
may
seem
to
have
died
a
natural
death
chewkle
my
knows
a
good
many
ways
said
chewkle
thoughtfully
that
the
thing
is
to
manage
so
as
not
to
be
do
not
think
there
is
much
fear
of
that
responded
grahame
with
an
affected
assumption
of
its
improbability
not
returned
chewkle
the
danger
to
number
von
as
i
looks
at
however
i
dessay
i
can
put
that
right
if
everything
else
is
squared
to
make
it
worth
my
grahame
produced
a
bank
of
england
note
for
fifty
pounds
my
good
chewkle
is
an
earnest
of
my
future
intentions
towards
you
he
observed
with
a
furtive
glance
at
the
somewhat
excited
countenance
as
he
placed
the
note
in
the
trembling
fingers
it
immediately
disappeared
like
magic
in
his
vest
he
turned
with
a
grin
to
his
employer
and
said
shall
be
done
once
urged
grahame
quickly
is
essential
that
no
time
should
be
lost
i
should
go
if
i
were
you
by
the
earliest
train
right
sir
hear
of
it
afore
the
out
in
the
best
friend
how
deeply
i
shall
stand
indebted
to
thought
chewkle
deeper
than
you
imagines
i
but
he
said
aloud
me
see
supposed
to
be
at
liverpool
which
is
a
good
thing
for
even
old
gummy
suspect
my
being
at
harleydale
and
i
shall
quietly
watch
for
the
old
man
taking
his
evening
walk
the
last
on
earth
for
at
all
grahame
shuddered
he
felt
anxious
to
get
rid
of
his
villainous
companion
think
we
understand
each
other
now
he
remarked
in
a
tone
which
intimated
that
he
wished
the
interview
to
terminate
replied
chewkle
with
a
very
meaning
nod
think
we
do
understand
each
other
now
and
my
belief
we
shall
understand
one
another
better
by
and
bye
good
night
night
good
night
cried
grahame
hastily
and
added
careful
how
you
descend
the
staircase
it
is
narrow
the
night
is
dark
and
an
accident
just
now
would
be
me
but
what
if
i
had
old
wilton
here
suggested
chewkle
with
a
savage
cackle
hush
exclaimed
grahame
in
a
whisper
so
loud
mind
how
you
go
do
not
let
the
servants
discover
you
whatever
you
do
and
above
all
be
sure
to
neglect
no
precaution
which
may
tend
to
ensure
the
success
of
your
chewkle
waved
his
hand
exultingly
and
disappeared
the
next
morning
he
was
on
his
way
towards
harleydale
manor
bent
on
executing
his
murderous
mission
chapter
the
return
home
and
with
a
fixed
eye
her
face
he
on
her
and
she
on
him
strange
how
like
they
looked
the
expression
was
the
same
serenely
savage
with
a
little
change
in
the
large
dark
mutual
darted
flame
for
she
too
was
as
one
who
could
avenge
if
cause
should
be
a
lioness
though
tame
her
blood
before
her
face
up
and
her
truly
of
his
race
byron
a
child
was
born
in
sobbing
anguish
in
cowering
shame
in
comparative
privation
a
little
weeping
helpless
weak
boy
was
ushered
into
life
oh
had
that
proud
woman
the
parent
of
the
young
mother
been
present
in
that
close
chamber
where
lay
fainting
the
of
her
flock
her
heartless
pride
must
have
received
a
blow
which
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
prove
beneficial
to
her
humanity
it
must
surely
have
roused
up
some
of
those
better
feelings
of
womanly
nature
of
which
none
of
the
sex
are
wholly
divested
unless
they
are
lost
indeed
upon
a
poorly
furnished
but
clean
bed
lay
stretched
helen
grahame
attended
only
by
her
ministering
angel
lotte
clinton
the
sudden
and
wholly
unexpected
interview
with
lester
vane
the
subsequent
flight
with
all
its
attendant
anxieties
and
apprehensions
and
fatigues
all
combined
to
do
their
work
upon
her
weak
frame
at
the
expiration
of
three
weeks
she
was
however
so
far
recovered
as
to
move
about
again
while
lotte
was
ill
enough
although
she
would
not
acknowledge
so
much
to
take
her
place
in
the
bed
helen
had
quitted
she
had
been
gentle
nurse
and
had
attended
her
with
patient
unwearying
assiduity
it
was
during
this
period
that
little
store
of
money
was
for
the
first
time
broken
in
before
the
birth
of
the
child
lotte
had
been
enabled
to
earn
enough
to
support
both
but
to
save
nothing
when
the
time
came
that
her
whole
attention
was
absorbed
by
helpless
prostration
her
labours
with
her
needle
were
necessarily
stopped
but
now
that
helen
had
strength
to
get
about
again
and
the
was
growing
very
low
it
became
necessary
that
she
should
once
more
return
to
her
close
application
in
the
task
of
was
there
not
another
claim
too
now
upon
her
exertion
the
little
healthy
boy
of
whom
unconsciously
she
grew
so
fond
and
who
was
caressed
and
fondled
by
its
young
mother
with
such
passionate
devotion
that
she
had
no
eyes
or
thought
for
aught
else
seemed
to
call
upon
her
to
redouble
her
efforts
that
he
might
be
spared
the
fatal
consequences
of
wasting
privation
one
night
she
quietly
explained
to
helen
their
position
and
the
necessity
there
would
be
for
her
to
again
apply
to
the
persons
who
had
last
employed
her
to
furnish
her
with
work
will
be
careful
she
said
avoid
the
chances
of
our
residence
being
discovered
but
we
are
not
fairies
you
know
helen
we
must
eat
and
drink
and
pay
our
helen
turned
her
large
dark
eyes
upon
her
face
and
fixed
them
there
she
did
not
reply
for
she
had
made
a
discovery
shall
be
sure
to
obtain
as
much
as
i
can
do
continued
lotte
thoughtfully
i
am
convinced
by
sitting
close
to
my
work
to
support
us
all
comfortably
you
can
devote
your
time
to
dear
little
hugh
so
as
to
keep
him
smiling
and
well
and
i
can
do
the
rest
all
the
the
child
was
sleeping
and
previous
to
commencement
of
the
conversation
helen
was
sitting
abstracted
in
deep
reflection
upon
the
past
from
this
she
was
roused
by
remarks
and
now
she
sat
and
gazed
in
painful
wonder
upon
her
face
it
was
pinched
haggard
and
wan
it
was
as
different
from
that
round
sweet
pleasant
countenance
she
had
looked
upon
with
a
satisfied
assurance
that
its
owner
was
entitled
to
her
fullest
confidence
when
first
alone
with
her
in
her
own
neat
little
chamber
as
could
be
conceived
once
form
was
wasted
too
her
dress
sat
loosely
upon
her
and
her
white
hands
looked
long
and
bony
the
words
she
uttered
rang
in
ears
sitting
close
to
my
work
i
can
support
us
all
she
weak
wasted
and
ill
to
devote
herself
to
such
a
task
the
whole
of
past
services
and
exertions
and
her
own
unconscious
selfishness
suddenly
flashed
through
brain
she
now
arrived
at
a
more
clear
and
complete
appreciation
of
what
lotte
had
really
done
for
her
what
she
had
sacrificed
and
what
she
had
suffered
then
came
the
question
as
to
motive
helen
rapidly
retraced
the
events
of
her
past
acquaintance
with
her
young
companion
and
endeavoured
in
such
prospects
of
the
future
as
might
have
presented
themselves
to
her
to
find
an
incentive
for
such
tender
devotion
as
she
had
evinced
towards
her
from
first
to
last
but
she
could
discover
nothing
which
detracted
from
her
pure
womanly
sympathy
her
unselfish
disinterestedness
how
heart
warmed
to
her
as
she
reached
the
only
conclusion
it
was
possible
to
form
and
lotte
looked
so
attenuated
so
strengthless
so
much
as
though
she
had
overtaxed
her
powers
and
was
gradually
sinking
into
the
arms
of
death
that
as
helen
gazed
upon
her
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
which
shut
her
out
from
her
sight
then
she
rose
up
and
moved
towards
her
hastily
she
flung
her
arms
about
her
and
wept
passionately
upon
her
neck
making
lotte
both
surprised
and
alarmed
have
i
said
she
ejaculated
quickly
nothing
i
hope
to
pain
you
helen
drove
back
her
tears
she
raised
up
her
head
seized
hands
and
kissed
them
ardently
am
pained
dearest
lotte
she
exclaimed
with
quivering
earnestness
but
striving
to
speak
collectedly
now
i
see
that
while
you
have
been
my
constant
generous
disinterested
friend
faithful
and
unwearied
in
your
kind
very
kind
services
to
me
i
have
been
altogether
selfish
exacting
and
inconsiderate
do
not
say
so
interposed
lotte
sweet
friend
who
can
judge
so
well
as
i
continued
helen
am
i
to
you
that
you
should
have
done
all
this
for
me
have
told
you
again
interrupted
lotte
but
helen
would
not
let
her
finish
me
speak
lotte
darling
she
exclaimed
is
all
unnecessary
for
you
to
say
one
word
you
can
not
weaken
the
fullness
of
my
conviction
nor
deter
me
from
a
purpose
i
have
determined
upon
executing
i
shall
not
tell
you
what
that
purpose
is
beyond
that
it
embraces
nothing
your
pure
nature
would
shrink
from
i
am
resolved
to
act
now
hitherto
you
have
done
all
i
shall
do
my
part
in
future
it
is
time
how
often
lotte
dear
have
i
not
quietly
submitted
to
your
counsel
and
acted
as
you
have
wished
henceforward
for
a
time
at
least
you
must
obey
me
you
must
submit
for
a
few
days
not
to
think
of
needlework
but
to
lay
quiet
and
still
in
bed
and
let
me
wait
upon
could
not
oh
i
could
not
murmured
lotte
touched
by
this
acknowledgment
but
helen
kissed
her
and
silenced
her
and
would
not
hear
her
objections
and
threatened
to
do
all
kind
of
desperate
things
unless
she
assented
to
her
request
lotte
alternately
coaxed
and
menaced
obeyed
though
she
was
restive
and
uncomfortable
under
the
knowledge
that
their
store
was
growing
hourly
less
while
helen
had
really
no
notion
of
the
value
of
money
or
its
want
unable
to
remain
long
in
bed
under
such
circumstances
lotte
struggled
through
two
days
on
the
third
she
persisted
in
getting
up
declaring
she
was
quite
strong
and
fit
now
to
undertake
anything
the
rest
had
certainly
done
her
previously
exhausted
frame
good
and
helen
could
not
help
perceiving
its
effects
upon
her
face
and
her
manner
so
she
made
no
great
objection
to
her
rising
but
that
same
evening
about
six
she
startled
lotte
by
appearing
before
her
dressed
as
when
first
they
met
in
hyde
park
lotte
was
dancing
the
infant
in
her
arms
helen
took
it
abruptly
from
her
kissed
it
passionately
many
times
and
then
placed
it
again
in
arms
the
latter
overwhelmed
with
surprise
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
the
greatest
astonishment
are
you
going
helen
in
name
do
not
be
guilty
of
any
rash
or
unadvised
step
oh
i
should
break
my
heart
if
out
of
any
mistaken
feeling
of
commiseration
or
tenderness
for
me
you
should
come
to
harm
not
fear
for
me
dear
dear
lotte
returned
helen
earnestly
worst
that
could
have
fallen
upon
me
has
come
to
pass
and
fate
will
not
persecute
me
further
i
shall
return
to
you
and
my
poor
cherub
there
very
soon
be
in
pity
tell
me
whither
you
are
going
cried
lotte
in
tears
she
had
some
frightful
forebodings
my
house
cried
helen
with
a
bright
eye
and
compressed
lip
before
lotte
could
recover
from
the
bewilderment
into
which
this
announcement
flung
her
she
heard
the
outer
door
slam
sharply
and
she
knew
that
helen
was
on
her
way
to
fulfil
her
purpose
she
pressed
the
little
babe
to
her
bosom
and
sat
down
to
think
about
her
position
her
brother
and
perhaps
mark
wilton
while
these
thoughts
were
yet
passing
through
brain
helen
grahame
stood
before
the
house
from
which
in
such
shame
and
anguish
she
had
fled
she
grew
sick
and
faint
and
for
a
moment
her
strength
and
courage
failed
her
but
she
remembered
her
little
child
and
wan
face
and
thin
figure
then
her
arm
was
nerved
and
she
knocked
boldly
as
of
old
at
the
door
the
porter
opened
it
but
when
he
saw
who
it
was
who
claimed
admission
he
drew
back
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
helen
heeded
it
not
nor
did
she
utter
a
word
to
him
but
passed
through
the
hall
with
a
proud
air
as
she
had
been
wont
to
display
when
at
home
and
no
shadow
rested
upon
her
fair
name
as
she
ascended
the
staircase
she
encountered
whelks
who
upon
thus
suddenly
coming
face
to
face
with
her
all
but
fainted
her
step
dignified
as
it
was
made
scarcely
a
sound
and
her
face
so
white
and
delicate
convinced
him
that
he
was
confronted
by
apparition
she
fastened
her
brilliant
black
eye
upon
him
and
haughtily
inquired
where
the
family
were
the
room
miss
he
gasped
dinner
she
asked
miss
he
replied
not
yet
certain
that
he
was
not
holding
converse
with
a
real
ghost
are
all
at
maid
chayter
where
is
she
demanded
helen
in
the
same
imperious
tone
left
miss
responded
whelks
with
a
gulp
gone
directly
after
you
some
time
ago
he
knew
not
how
to
express
himself
in
his
excitement
miss
maid
exclaimed
helen
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
her
miss
she
she
are
in
miss
room
miss
returned
helen
in
the
same
cold
haughty
voice
and
added
sternly
not
my
arrival
to
any
one
i
will
announce
she
passed
him
and
proceeded
direct
to
her
room
within
it
was
seated
the
young
maid
who
attended
evangeline
she
had
taken
the
opportunity
while
the
family
were
at
dinner
to
place
herself
very
close
to
the
light
of
a
lamp
and
read
over
slowly
and
earnestly
a
letter
addressed
to
her
by
one
george
jenkins
wherein
he
had
made
statements
which
made
her
eyes
glitter
and
her
lips
to
pucker
into
a
small
circle
she
laid
her
letter
in
her
lap
to
revel
in
one
enchanting
sentence
when
she
became
conscious
of
the
presence
of
some
one
in
the
room
standing
in
front
of
her
with
a
slight
scream
she
leaped
up
and
crumpling
her
letter
in
her
hand
crammed
it
into
her
pocket
and
with
scarlet
face
and
trembling
limbs
saw
that
the
eldest
miss
grahame
or
her
wraith
stood
before
her
she
was
about
to
make
a
very
lively
demonstration
but
helen
checked
her
not
alarmed
she
said
hastily
no
noise
do
as
i
direct
you
for
i
shall
need
your
are
really
and
truly
miss
grahame
come
home
again
asked
the
girl
her
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
their
sockets
helen
almost
smiled
as
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
for
the
features
of
the
inquirer
betrayed
so
singular
an
expression
the
girl
clapped
her
hands
how
happy
you
will
make
miss
eva
she
exclaimed
has
done
nothing
but
weep
and
sigh
for
you
since
you
have
been
helen
felt
a
rush
of
tears
to
her
eyes
but
she
made
no
remark
in
answer
to
this
observation
she
however
put
some
questions
to
the
girl
respecting
her
own
room
and
finding
that
it
remained
precisely
as
she
left
it
she
went
to
it
followed
by
the
maid
in
a
desk
belonging
to
her
and
which
in
her
illness
she
had
hidden
for
it
contained
many
of
letters
was
a
store
of
money
sums
the
balances
of
many
allowances
hoarded
under
the
impression
that
one
day
they
would
collectively
be
sufficient
to
buy
some
coveted
jewelled
trinket
which
would
exceed
in
price
an
amount
her
father
would
be
likely
to
approach
in
the
purchase
of
a
gift
for
her
the
gold
was
needed
for
a
very
different
purpose
now
she
discovered
the
desk
precisely
as
she
had
left
it
and
she
made
herself
at
once
mistress
of
what
she
came
to
obtain
she
went
to
her
wardrobe
her
dresses
hung
there
as
she
had
left
them
and
after
surveying
them
for
a
minute
she
turned
to
maid
and
said
abruptly
me
to
having
selected
her
most
elegant
and
becoming
apparel
she
proceeded
to
make
her
toilet
and
quickly
appeared
in
full
evening
dress
when
the
girl
had
almost
completed
attiring
her
helen
said
to
her
whether
dinner
is
over
but
not
a
word
that
i
am
the
girl
with
an
air
of
mystery
stamped
on
her
features
proceeded
on
to
the
and
having
conferred
with
the
butler
returned
and
said
is
on
the
table
is
well
muttered
helen
will
face
them
there
was
a
strange
expression
upon
her
features
there
was
no
humility
her
eye
her
brow
her
lips
were
all
defiant
having
obtained
what
she
came
for
her
object
in
facing
her
relatives
was
not
altogether
clear
even
to
herself
it
was
an
impulse
she
could
not
resist
she
knew
how
little
real
affection
she
had
experienced
from
her
parents
and
her
sister
margaret
they
were
all
too
proud
to
be
fond
and
she
could
not
endure
the
sting
of
their
accusing
thoughts
or
remarks
she
had
no
intention
to
let
them
know
the
truth
even
now
but
at
the
same
time
she
wished
them
to
feel
that
she
had
acted
in
a
spirit
of
independent
and
that
her
course
in
future
would
be
governed
by
the
same
influence
she
remembered
what
she
had
written
in
the
note
she
had
left
behind
upon
her
dressing
table
addressed
to
her
mother
when
she
fled
its
contents
she
determined
to
make
the
of
her
action
it
happened
that
grahame
had
guests
that
day
there
were
two
very
high
very
proud
very
rich
members
of
the
aristocracy
a
kinsman
of
his
from
the
north
infinitely
more
proud
than
rich
and
the
young
duke
of
allborne
who
had
recently
exhibited
symptoms
of
being
entangled
in
the
meshes
which
margaret
grahame
had
with
cold
calculation
and
no
mean
skill
contrived
to
wind
about
him
helen
perhaps
would
have
shrunk
from
encountering
this
assemblage
had
she
known
that
her
relatives
were
not
dining
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
put
the
question
and
she
proceeded
to
the
expecting
only
to
meet
her
parents
her
brother
and
her
sisters
the
conversation
at
the
table
when
she
entered
the
was
as
animated
and
lively
as
might
be
expected
grahame
was
endeavouring
to
forget
that
he
stood
upon
a
volcano
which
roared
and
seethed
and
bubbled
beneath
his
feet
he
was
engaged
discussing
a
political
question
with
his
two
aristocratic
friends
grahame
was
occupied
with
her
kinsman
and
margaret
exclusively
with
the
duke
alternately
flattering
him
and
deferring
with
the
profoundest
attention
and
deference
to
his
observations
so
that
he
felt
quite
sure
that
if
she
did
not
possess
the
beauty
of
many
he
had
seen
she
had
wonderful
discrimination
malcolm
was
silently
drinking
to
lotte
pledging
her
mentally
every
time
the
bottle
came
round
and
evangeline
still
and
retiring
as
ever
was
thinking
about
her
sister
helen
and
perhaps
the
young
gentleman
who
had
lost
a
sister
too
the
door
flew
open
widely
grahame
shouted
the
butler
with
extended
orbs
and
inflated
nostrils
helen
full
dressed
pale
as
marble
but
stately
as
a
queen
walked
up
the
room
to
an
unoccupied
seat
upon
the
right
hand
of
her
mother
she
made
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
to
those
present
and
then
seated
herself
with
a
considering
the
events
which
had
happened
quite
startling
grahame
was
involuntarily
repeated
by
every
one
present
and
naturally
all
eyes
rested
upon
her
a
strange
and
as
it
were
a
solemn
stillness
followed
her
appearance
her
face
was
so
white
so
transparent
and
colourless
her
eyes
shone
with
such
unearthly
brilliancy
her
hair
lay
so
black
and
glossy
upon
her
brow
contrasting
powerfully
with
her
snowy
temples
she
sat
so
erect
and
gazed
around
her
with
so
haughty
and
defiant
a
mien
that
if
not
deemed
a
phantom
by
those
who
were
strangers
to
her
they
at
least
suspected
that
she
had
risen
from
a
bed
of
sickness
and
in
a
fit
of
temporary
derangement
had
decked
herself
out
in
ball
attire
and
presented
herself
thus
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
before
them
the
eyes
of
the
guests
next
sought
the
face
of
grahame
to
learn
what
effect
this
apparition
had
upon
his
face
had
become
as
white
as
that
of
his
own
child
he
could
have
screamed
with
horror
when
he
saw
her
bend
her
full
dark
eye
on
his
and
slowly
and
calmly
seat
herself
before
him
a
thousand
thoughts
passed
through
his
already
tortured
mind
whither
had
she
been
whence
had
she
come
and
in
that
dread
interval
what
had
happened
how
had
she
come
back
and
for
why
did
she
now
appear
and
thus
she
was
his
own
child
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
but
oh
so
changed
so
dreadfully
changed
a
spectral
shadow
only
of
her
former
self
was
she
now
what
was
he
to
do
what
could
he
do
he
dare
not
for
very
pride
sake
hazard
a
scene
but
how
receive
her
what
could
he
say
she
anticipated
him
in
a
firm
clear
voice
she
exclaimed
addressing
herself
to
him
was
unaware
that
you
were
honoured
with
the
presence
of
guests
sir
or
i
should
have
not
joined
the
circle
until
you
assembled
in
the
i
hope
they
and
you
will
accept
my
apologies
for
presenting
myself
here
either
too
soon
or
too
coming
here
at
all
thought
grahame
with
an
inward
groan
grahame
seemed
to
contract
to
shrivel
into
a
thin
old
woman
while
margaret
let
her
eyes
close
and
her
brow
fall
she
sealed
her
lips
too
and
sat
like
a
granite
figure
and
became
almost
of
the
same
hue
malcolm
looked
at
his
sister
and
drank
another
glass
of
port
appears
to
me
he
thought
there
will
be
a
serious
disturbance
in
this
of
all
evangeline
alone
recognised
her
sister
as
her
sister
retiring
by
nature
she
may
have
been
but
she
was
bold
in
this
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
passing
with
more
display
than
she
was
in
the
habit
of
making
behind
those
who
sat
between
her
and
helen
she
heeded
not
her
stern
look
or
her
stony
aspect
but
she
caught
her
hands
and
pressed
them
she
bent
over
and
kissed
her
cold
cold
forehead
home
helen
dearest
she
said
with
passionate
tenderness
but
there
her
speech
left
her
and
tears
thronged
into
her
eyes
helen
could
not
now
articulate
a
word
if
her
life
had
depended
on
it
she
squeezed
hands
and
oh
how
she
longed
to
kiss
her
but
she
felt
she
dare
not
at
a
glance
from
helen
eva
resumed
her
seat
the
little
incident
of
which
evangeline
had
been
the
heroine
seemed
to
assure
the
guests
that
they
had
surmised
wrongly
and
the
two
aristocrats
at
once
bent
over
to
grahame
and
requested
to
his
dismay
to
be
introduced
to
his
eldest
daughter
the
duke
of
allborne
sprang
to
his
feet
and
cried
with
some
vivacity
me
lindsay
and
elsingham
to
have
that
honaw
i
have
had
the
vewy
gweat
playshaw
of
enjoying
the
agweeable
society
of
miss
gwahame
on
vawious
occasions
always
with
incweasing
delight
and
in
dwawing
you
together
i
feel
convinced
i
shall
be
confawing
on
you
both
a
happiness
of
which
at
pwesent
you
have
no
but
grahame
in
a
voice
scarcely
articulate
thanked
him
declined
his
services
and
took
the
office
upon
himself
he
went
through
the
ceremony
of
introduction
with
frigid
formality
and
helen
supported
it
with
a
grace
and
dignity
which
elevated
her
in
the
estimation
of
the
gentlemen
to
whom
she
was
introduced
although
they
had
yet
a
misgiving
respecting
her
from
the
continued
cold
silence
towards
her
of
every
member
of
her
family
save
evangeline
the
duke
began
to
engage
her
in
conversation
made
some
remarks
respecting
the
delicate
health
her
appearance
betrayed
and
was
in
full
career
to
forget
margaret
entirely
in
his
increasing
admiration
of
beauty
when
once
more
the
door
of
the
room
was
flung
wide
and
the
butler
announced
honorable
lester
helen
set
her
teeth
together
hard
she
drew
her
form
proudly
erect
and
sat
more
like
a
queen
than
ever
man
should
have
announced
the
honawable
lestaw
vane
i
think
gwahame
exclaimed
the
young
duke
with
a
slight
laugh
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
duke
returned
vane
calmly
suffering
his
gaze
to
wander
slowly
round
the
table
grahame
was
conscious
that
i
should
be
unable
to
join
until
this
hour
and
kindly
consented
to
waive
his
eye
fell
upon
helen
grahame
and
he
paused
his
face
betrayed
an
aspect
of
intense
amazement
then
his
eye
ran
rapidly
round
upon
the
countenances
of
all
there
another
instant
and
he
had
recovered
his
he
went
on
speaking
waive
the
usual
observances
in
my
favour
and
admit
me
at
any
hour
i
might
be
able
to
reach
a
few
words
of
vapid
nothings
and
lester
seated
himself
before
his
wine
that
he
might
more
quietly
and
coolly
examine
the
vision
before
him
and
learn
if
possible
the
cause
of
her
being
here
where
after
his
interview
with
her
at
the
humble
lodgings
he
least
of
all
expected
to
meet
her
he
had
been
soundly
thrashed
by
bantom
but
though
he
was
confined
for
a
week
to
his
chamber
he
had
got
over
it
without
however
as
yet
discovering
the
individual
who
had
subjected
him
to
the
outrage
once
his
eyes
and
met
but
there
was
an
expression
in
her
bright
orbs
which
he
could
not
bear
unmoved
and
he
looked
away
from
her
suddenly
grahame
rose
from
her
seat
and
prepared
to
quit
the
room
the
gentlemen
rose
up
too
the
mother
seemed
to
shrink
and
totter
as
she
passed
the
child
at
whom
only
she
had
looked
once
since
she
entered
but
to
whom
she
had
not
uttered
a
word
margaret
would
have
haughtily
though
hastily
followed
her
but
that
helen
with
an
imperial
bearing
stood
before
her
and
compelled
her
to
halt
while
she
took
her
place
as
the
eldest
daughter
next
to
her
mother
the
incident
was
but
momentary
and
might
have
been
considered
accidental
but
for
the
decisive
action
and
even
grand
bearing
of
helen
whiter
still
from
the
insult
her
sister
margaret
would
have
publicly
forced
upon
her
every
one
observed
it
and
the
sympathy
of
the
guests
at
least
was
with
her
they
passed
out
of
the
room
grahame
hurrying
to
her
own
chamber
and
fastening
herself
within
as
if
in
fear
that
helen
should
seek
her
there
margaret
copied
her
example
but
helen
went
only
where
she
wished
to
go
to
room
to
have
a
few
loving
words
with
her
youngest
sister
before
she
took
her
leave
of
her
home
for
ever
she
had
attained
her
object
if
any
she
had
and
she
intended
to
leave
as
abruptly
as
she
had
entered
caring
not
to
see
one
of
her
relatives
save
evangeline
more
when
the
door
closed
one
of
the
distinguished
guests
a
peer
and
a
bachelor
known
to
be
enormously
wealthy
turned
to
his
half
distracted
host
and
said
your
eldest
daughter
is
the
most
lovely
woman
i
ever
beheld
she
has
the
dignity
of
an
empress
and
the
form
of
a
goddess
cleopatra
herself
could
not
have
been
more
grandly
grahame
bowed
distressed
beyond
measure
he
knew
not
how
to
answer
the
peer
added
addressing
the
guests
honour
my
toast
with
bumpers
miss
grahame
he
drained
his
glass
to
the
dregs
so
did
all
but
grahame
the
wine
tasted
like
molten
lead
in
his
mouth
he
put
down
his
glass
scarcely
touched
my
life
exclaimed
the
young
duke
with
his
vacant
laugh
do
believe
you
aw
smitten
with
miss
chawms
accept
your
tribute
to
my
taste
he
answered
with
a
seriousness
of
tone
which
there
was
no
mistaking
man
honoured
with
the
hand
of
one
so
beautiful
ought
to
wish
for
no
greater
exaltation
on
earth
were
miss
grahame
and
would
she
condescend
to
turn
her
eyes
upon
one
who
would
offer
her
a
waning
devotion
i
think
upon
my
faith
your
grace
would
have
good
reason
to
find
your
suggestion
not
very
wide
of
the
the
duke
laughed
loudly
and
was
echoed
by
one
or
two
others
lester
vane
sat
grimly
silent
so
did
grahame
the
latter
suddenly
rose
up
and
bade
his
son
malcolm
do
the
honours
of
the
table
for
him
during
a
short
absence
he
had
caught
at
a
straw
he
had
been
long
drowning
and
everything
resembling
a
straw
approaching
the
vortex
in
which
he
was
slowly
and
surely
revolving
he
clutched
at
his
daughter
helen
might
yet
be
a
peeress
the
idol
of
a
nobleman
of
vast
wealth
she
might
now
be
the
means
of
plucking
him
from
destruction
even
while
the
destroying
waters
were
bubbling
on
his
lips
helen
and
evangeline
had
but
interchanged
a
few
hurried
words
when
their
father
suddenly
stood
before
them
they
both
rose
he
exclaimed
sternly
and
coldly
me
to
my
not
a
word
more
he
made
a
gesture
which
was
so
imperious
in
character
that
she
could
not
but
involuntarily
obey
it
and
she
went
in
the
direction
in
which
he
pointed
he
followed
her
and
when
they
were
within
the
room
he
locked
the
door
evangeline
crept
after
them
she
stood
at
the
library
door
in
silence
but
in
tears
