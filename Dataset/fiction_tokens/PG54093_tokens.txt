am
your
loving
son
it
was
the
table
room
of
one
of
the
best
hotels
in
nice
a
large
room
gay
and
attractive
according
to
its
kind
as
fresh
paint
bright
decoration
and
expanse
of
could
make
it
from
end
to
end
were
ranged
small
tables
varying
in
size
but
uniform
in
the
radiant
spotlessness
of
their
white
cloths
and
the
brightness
of
their
silver
china
or
glass
and
to
and
fro
between
the
tables
and
from
the
tables
to
the
door
moved
active
waiters
whose
one
aim
in
life
seemed
to
be
the
anticipation
of
the
wishes
of
the
visitors
for
whose
pleasure
alone
they
apparently
existed
it
was
early
and
proper
was
hardly
in
full
swing
as
yet
but
a
good
many
of
the
tables
were
occupied
and
a
subdued
hum
of
conversation
pervaded
the
air
a
hum
compounded
of
the
chatter
of
american
women
and
the
quick
eager
volubility
of
french
tongues
backed
by
a
less
pronounced
but
perfectly
perceptible
undercurrent
of
german
and
english
the
whole
diversified
now
and
then
by
a
light
laugh
the
sounds
were
subdued
because
the
room
was
large
and
sparsely
filled
but
they
were
gay
the
smiling
alacrity
of
the
waiters
was
apparently
at
once
a
symptom
of
and
a
subtle
tribute
to
the
humour
of
the
hour
there
were
sundry
faces
here
and
there
among
the
little
groups
men
to
whom
neither
ambition
nor
care
could
have
been
empty
words
women
with
lines
about
their
faces
not
lightly
come
by
young
girls
with
the
vague
desire
and
unrest
of
youth
young
men
with
its
secrets
and
its
aspirations
but
all
individuality
of
care
anxiety
or
desire
seemed
to
be
in
abeyance
for
the
time
being
enjoyment
somewhat
conventional
enjoyment
of
the
kind
that
rather
covers
up
trouble
as
not
than
disperses
it
was
evidently
the
order
of
the
day
it
was
within
three
days
of
the
carnival
and
the
visitors
who
were
crowding
into
nice
came
one
and
all
with
fixedly
and
obviously
intention
the
link
between
the
little
letter
not
little
by
any
means
in
a
material
sense
since
its
capitals
sprawled
and
staggered
over
a
large
sheet
of
foreign
letter
paper
and
the
smart
atmosphere
of
the
nice
table
room
was
a
woman
who
sat
at
a
little
table
by
one
of
the
open
windows
and
she
was
much
more
easily
to
be
identified
arguing
from
her
appearance
and
manner
with
her
present
surroundings
than
with
the
images
conjured
up
by
the
blotted
letter
in
her
hand
she
was
a
small
woman
with
a
very
erect
little
figure
the
trimness
of
which
was
accentuated
by
the
conventional
perfection
of
the
dress
she
wore
it
was
not
such
a
dress
as
would
commend
itself
to
the
fashionable
woman
of
at
that
date
eighteen
hundred
and
garments
for
ladies
were
not
but
it
had
won
a
glance
of
respect
nevertheless
from
every
woman
in
the
room
in
the
course
of
the
few
minutes
which
had
elapsed
since
its
wearer
had
entered
her
hair
was
fair
very
plentiful
and
very
fashionably
dressed
her
eyes
were
blue
her
colouring
pale
if
she
had
had
no
other
claims
on
a
attention
no
more
marked
characteristics
she
might
have
been
called
rather
pretty
she
was
rather
pretty
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
her
prettiness
was
dwarfed
and
put
out
of
sight
by
the
stronger
influence
of
her
manner
and
expression
as
she
sat
there
reading
her
letter
neither
moving
nor
speaking
she
was
stamped
from
head
to
foot
as
far
as
externals
went
as
one
of
a
type
of
woman
which
commands
more
superficial
homage
than
perhaps
any
other
the
woman
of
the
world
the
the
quiet
unquestioning
assurance
even
the
superficiality
of
her
expression
in
its
total
absence
of
intellectuality
or
emotionalism
spoke
to
character
the
narrow
character
truly
which
is
cognisant
only
of
shallow
waters
knows
them
and
reigns
in
them
but
it
was
a
noticeable
feature
about
her
that
even
this
character
had
gone
to
the
accentuation
of
the
type
in
her
as
to
her
age
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
to
guess
it
from
her
appearance
her
face
was
quite
unworn
evidently
such
emotions
as
she
had
known
had
gone
by
no
means
deep
and
yet
it
was
not
young
there
was
too
much
knowledge
of
the
world
about
it
for
youthfulness
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
years
old
she
was
sitting
alone
at
the
little
table
by
the
window
and
her
perfect
freedom
from
nervousness
or
even
consciousness
of
the
admiring
glances
cast
at
her
emphasized
her
perfect
a
waiter
smiling
and
assiduous
even
beyond
the
smiling
assiduity
with
which
he
had
waited
at
other
tables
appeared
with
her
breakfast
and
as
he
arranged
it
on
the
table
she
replaced
the
blotted
letter
in
its
envelope
with
a
certain
lingering
touch
that
was
apparently
quite
unconscious
and
contrasted
rather
oddly
with
her
face
the
envelope
was
addressed
in
a
writing
to
william
romayne
hôtel
florian
it
was
one
of
a
pile
and
she
took
up
the
others
and
looked
them
through
they
all
bore
the
same
name
are
no
letters
for
romayne
she
said
to
the
waiter
carelessly
the
voice
was
rather
thin
and
as
would
have
been
expected
from
her
face
slightly
unsympathetic
but
it
was
refined
and
well
modulated
her
french
was
excellent
the
waiter
thus
questioned
showed
a
letter
a
looking
letter
in
a
blue
envelope
which
he
had
brought
in
on
his
tray
and
presented
it
with
a
torrent
of
explanation
and
apology
it
had
arrived
last
night
before
the
arrival
of
monsieur
and
madame
and
with
carelessness
but
with
quite
amazing
carelessness
indeed
it
had
been
placed
in
a
private
ordered
by
another
english
monsieur
who
had
arrived
only
this
morning
by
the
valet
of
this
english
monsieur
it
had
been
given
to
the
waiter
this
moment
only
by
the
waiter
it
was
now
given
to
madame
with
ten
million
desolations
that
such
an
accident
should
have
occurred
monsieur
had
seemed
so
anxious
for
letters
on
his
arrival
if
madame
would
have
the
goodness
to
explain
madame
stopped
the
flood
of
protestations
with
a
little
gesture
however
it
might
affect
monsieur
the
accident
did
not
appear
to
disturb
her
greatly
indeed
it
was
inconceivable
that
she
should
be
easily
ruffled
romayne
have
the
letter
at
once
she
said
send
him
also
a
cup
of
coffee
and
an
english
newspaper
the
waiter
signified
his
readiness
to
do
her
bidding
with
the
greatest
alacrity
took
the
letter
from
her
with
an
apologetic
bow
laid
by
her
side
a
newspaper
for
own
reading
as
he
said
and
retired
left
once
more
alone
madame
proceeded
to
breakfast
in
a
dainty
leisurely
fashion
ignoring
the
newspaper
for
the
present
and
drawing
from
the
envelope
in
which
she
had
replaced
the
childish
little
epistle
a
second
letter
it
was
a
long
one
and
she
read
it
placidly
as
she
went
on
with
her
breakfast
dear
hermia
it
ran
has
just
accomplished
the
enclosed
with
a
great
deal
of
pride
and
excitement
the
wild
scrawls
that
occur
here
and
there
were
the
result
of
imperative
demands
on
his
part
to
be
allowed
to
write
by
the
dear
pet
is
very
well
and
grows
sweeter
every
day
i
believe
you
were
to
meet
romayne
at
mentone
on
the
second
i
think
he
said
and
to
go
on
to
nice
the
next
day
so
i
hope
you
will
get
this
soon
after
you
arrive
there
i
hope
the
change
will
do
romayne
good
he
came
here
to
see
julian
yesterday
and
i
did
not
think
him
looking
well
nor
did
father
he
only
laughed
when
father
told
him
so
we
were
so
glad
to
get
your
last
letter
you
are
not
a
very
good
correspondent
are
you
but
of
course
you
were
going
out
a
great
deal
in
paris
and
had
not
much
time
for
writing
you
seem
to
have
had
a
delightful
time
there
falconer
came
back
last
week
he
has
been
away
nearly
a
year
you
know
he
is
very
brown
and
has
a
long
beard
which
is
rather
becoming
the
royal
geographical
are
beginning
to
think
rather
highly
of
him
father
is
told
and
he
will
probably
get
something
important
to
do
before
long
father
wanted
him
to
come
and
stay
here
but
he
has
gone
back
to
his
old
chambers
not
very
cousinly
of
him
i
think
say
whether
you
are
coming
to
london
for
the
season
i
asked
romayne
but
he
said
he
did
not
know
what
your
plans
were
i
do
so
hope
you
will
come
though
i
am
afraid
i
should
not
be
pleased
if
the
spirit
should
move
you
to
settle
down
in
england
and
demand
julian
however
i
suppose
that
is
not
very
likely
much
love
dear
hermia
very
affectionate
cousin
romayne
finished
the
letter
which
she
had
read
with
leisurely
calm
as
though
her
interest
in
it
was
by
no
means
of
a
thrilling
nature
and
then
opened
and
glanced
through
the
others
which
were
waiting
their
turn
they
were
of
various
natures
one
or
two
came
from
villas
about
nice
and
consisted
of
more
or
less
pressing
invitations
one
was
from
a
leader
of
society
in
rome
a
long
chatty
letter
which
the
recipient
read
with
evident
amusement
and
interest
there
were
also
one
or
two
bills
at
which
romayne
glanced
with
the
composure
of
a
woman
with
whom
money
is
plentiful
breakfast
and
correspondence
were
alike
disposed
of
at
last
and
by
this
time
the
room
was
nearly
full
the
laughter
and
talk
was
louder
now
the
atmosphere
of
gaiety
was
more
accentuated
outside
in
the
sunshine
in
the
public
gardens
a
band
was
playing
romayne
was
alone
it
is
true
and
her
voice
consequently
added
nothing
to
the
pervading
note
but
her
presence
solitary
as
it
was
was
no
jarring
element
she
was
not
lonely
her
solitude
was
evidently
an
affair
of
the
moment
merely
she
was
absolutely
in
touch
with
the
spirit
of
the
hour
and
no
laughing
excited
girl
there
witnessed
more
eloquently
or
more
unconsciously
to
the
dominion
of
the
pleasures
of
life
than
did
the
looking
little
woman
to
whom
its
pleasures
were
also
its
businesses
the
only
businesses
she
knew
she
had
gathered
her
letters
together
and
was
rising
from
her
seat
with
a
certain
amount
of
indecision
in
her
face
when
a
waiter
entered
the
room
and
came
up
to
her
ladies
wishing
to
see
madame
were
in
the
salon
he
said
and
he
handed
her
as
he
spoke
a
bearing
the
name
underneath
the
name
was
written
in
pencil
unconscionable
hour
to
invade
you
but
we
are
going
this
afternoon
to
la
turbie
and
we
hope
we
may
perhaps
persuade
you
to
join
ladies
are
in
the
salon
you
say
said
romayne
glancing
up
with
the
careless
satisfaction
of
a
woman
to
whom
the
turn
of
events
usually
does
bring
satisfaction
perhaps
because
her
demands
and
her
experience
are
alike
of
the
most
superficial
description
the
salon
madame
returned
the
waiter
ladies
and
two
he
was
conducting
her
obsequiously
across
the
room
as
he
spoke
and
a
moment
later
he
opened
the
door
of
the
salon
and
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
in
a
little
clamour
ensued
upon
her
entrance
greetings
questions
and
answers
as
between
acquaintances
who
had
not
met
for
some
time
and
met
now
with
a
pleasure
which
seemed
rather
part
and
parcel
of
the
gaiety
to
which
the
atmosphere
of
the
had
witnessed
than
an
affair
of
the
feelings
all
five
visitors
were
apparently
under
the
eldest
being
a
man
of
perhaps
three
or
addressed
by
romayne
as
lord
cloughton
the
youngest
a
pretty
girl
who
was
introduced
by
the
leader
of
the
party
presumably
lady
cloughton
herself
quite
a
young
woman
as
little
they
were
all
they
were
all
apparently
in
the
best
possible
spirits
and
bent
upon
enjoyment
and
gay
little
laughs
interspersed
the
chatter
incessantly
breaking
from
one
or
the
other
on
little
or
no
apparent
provocation
eventually
lady
voice
detached
itself
and
went
on
alone
heard
you
were
here
she
said
a
man
who
is
staying
here
we
are
at
the
français
you
know
and
we
said
at
once
romayne
is
not
engaged
for
so
many
people
come
you
see
until
the
day
before
the
carnival
and
consequently
of
course
one
has
fewer
friends
and
fewer
engagements
and
this
week
is
not
so
full
you
know
she
has
no
engagement
for
we
said
pleasant
it
would
be
if
she
would
come
with
us
to
la
we
have
to
make
acquaintance
you
know
so
charmed
to
have
the
opportunity
i
hope
he
is
well
well
thanks
replied
his
wife
has
been
in
london
all
the
winter
his
business
always
seems
to
take
him
to
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
and
either
the
climate
or
his
work
seems
to
have
knocked
him
up
a
little
he
seems
to
have
got
into
a
shocking
habit
of
sitting
up
all
night
and
staying
in
bed
all
day
at
least
he
has
acted
on
that
principle
during
the
week
we
have
been
together
he
is
actually
not
up
romayne
smiled
as
she
spoke
her
apparently
sat
very
lightly
on
her
in
fact
there
was
something
singularly
disengaged
and
impersonal
in
her
manner
of
speaking
of
him
altogether
her
visitor
received
her
smile
with
a
pretty
little
unmeaning
laugh
and
went
on
with
much
superficial
eagerness
may
perhaps
be
up
in
time
for
our
expedition
though
we
thought
of
starting
in
about
two
time
they
say
the
place
is
perfectly
beautiful
at
this
time
of
year
perhaps
you
know
returned
romayne
enough
i
have
never
been
to
nice
before
i
have
often
talked
of
wintering
here
but
i
have
always
eventually
gone
somewhere
else
are
you
here
for
the
first
time
she
added
turning
to
the
young
man
whom
she
had
received
as
allan
and
who
evidently
occupied
the
position
of
mutual
acquaintance
between
herself
and
her
other
visitors
he
was
answering
her
in
the
affirmative
when
lord
cloughton
struck
in
with
a
cheery
laugh
been
here
two
days
and
he
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
nice
is
a
beastly
hole
romayne
he
said
expedition
is
really
a
device
on
our
part
for
cheering
him
up
he
let
himself
be
persuaded
into
putting
some
money
into
a
new
bank
and
the
new
bank
has
smashed
have
you
seen
the
papers
now
allan
lost
much
fortunately
it
that
that
weighs
upon
him
but
he
is
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
his
own
imbecility
you
old
fellow
the
young
man
laughed
freely
enough
i
am
he
said
would
you
be
cloughton
he
romayne
and
tell
me
you
have
done
the
same
because
any
fellow
would
in
my
place
however
if
romayne
is
more
likely
to
join
us
this
afternoon
if
the
proceedings
are
presented
to
her
in
the
light
of
a
charity
quite
willing
to
pose
as
an
object
take
pity
on
me
romayne
do
pity
you
answered
romayne
lightly
seem
to
me
to
be
much
depressed
and
your
misfortunes
appear
to
be
of
your
own
making
but
i
shall
be
delighted
to
go
with
you
this
afternoon
she
continued
turning
to
lady
cloughton
i
feel
sure
that
romayne
will
also
be
is
quite
charming
of
you
exclaimed
lady
cloughton
rising
as
she
spoke
then
i
think
if
we
were
to
call
for
you
yes
we
will
call
for
you
in
two
hours
from
now
so
glad
you
can
come
the
little
boy
quite
well
so
glad
in
two
hours
then
au
there
was
a
flutter
of
departure
a
chorus
of
bright
meaningless
last
words
and
romayne
stood
at
the
head
of
the
great
staircase
waving
her
hand
in
farewell
as
her
visitors
with
a
last
backward
glance
and
parting
smiles
and
gestures
disappeared
from
view
she
stood
a
moment
watching
some
people
in
the
hall
below
whose
appearance
had
struck
her
at
dinner
on
the
previous
evening
and
as
she
looked
idly
at
them
she
saw
a
man
come
in
an
englishman
evidently
just
off
a
journey
and
a
as
she
decided
absently
and
go
up
to
a
waiter
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
the
englishman
evidently
asked
a
question
and
then
another
and
another
and
finally
the
waiter
glanced
up
the
stairs
to
where
romayne
stood
carelessly
watching
and
obviously
pointed
her
out
to
his
interlocutor
asking
a
question
in
his
turn
the
englishman
after
looking
quickly
in
direction
shook
his
head
in
answer
and
walked
into
the
with
a
vague
feeling
of
surprise
and
curiosity
romayne
turned
and
moved
away
she
retraced
her
steps
evidently
intending
to
go
upstairs
but
as
she
passed
the
open
door
of
the
she
hesitated
her
eyes
caught
by
the
bright
prospect
visible
through
the
open
windows
which
looked
out
over
the
public
gardens
and
the
blue
mediterranean
her
ears
caught
by
the
sounds
from
the
band
still
playing
outside
she
the
room
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
with
inattentive
pleasure
the
dialogue
she
had
witnessed
in
the
hall
quite
forgotten
as
she
thought
of
her
own
affairs
she
thought
of
the
immediate
prospects
of
the
next
few
weeks
wholly
satisfactory
prospects
they
were
to
judge
from
her
expression
she
thought
of
the
letters
she
had
received
that
morning
mentally
answering
the
invitations
she
had
received
she
thought
of
the
acquaintances
who
had
just
left
her
and
of
the
engagement
she
had
made
for
that
afternoon
and
then
as
if
the
necessity
for
seeing
her
husband
on
the
subject
had
by
this
means
become
freshly
present
to
her
she
turned
away
from
the
window
and
went
out
of
the
room
and
up
the
staircase
on
her
way
she
chanced
to
glance
down
into
the
hall
and
noticed
the
englishman
to
whom
the
waiter
had
pointed
her
out
leaning
in
a
reposeful
and
eminently
stationary
attitude
against
the
entrance
she
would
ask
who
he
was
she
resolved
idly
she
went
on
until
she
came
to
a
door
at
the
end
of
a
long
corridor
outside
which
stood
a
dainty
little
pair
of
walking
shoes
and
a
pair
of
boots
she
glanced
at
them
and
lifted
her
eyebrows
slightly
a
characteristic
gesture
and
then
opened
the
door
it
led
into
a
little
from
which
another
doorway
on
the
left
led
evidently
into
a
larger
room
beyond
the
glimpse
of
the
latter
afforded
by
the
partly
open
door
showed
it
dim
and
dark
by
contrast
with
the
light
outside
apparently
the
blind
was
but
slightly
raised
there
was
no
sunshine
in
the
either
though
it
was
light
enough
and
as
romayne
went
in
and
shut
the
door
she
seemed
to
pass
into
a
silence
that
was
almost
oppressive
the
band
the
strains
of
which
had
reached
her
at
the
very
threshold
was
not
audible
in
the
room
in
shutting
the
door
she
seemed
to
shut
out
all
external
sounds
and
within
the
room
was
absolute
stillness
the
contrast
however
made
no
impression
whatever
upon
romayne
she
was
by
no
means
sensitive
evidently
to
such
subtle
influence
she
glanced
carelessly
through
the
doorway
into
the
dim
vista
of
the
bedroom
beyond
and
going
to
the
other
end
of
the
knelt
down
by
a
portmanteau
and
began
to
search
in
it
with
the
uncertainty
of
a
woman
whose
packing
is
done
for
her
by
a
maid
she
found
what
she
wanted
sundry
dainty
adjuncts
to
attire
one
of
which
a
large
lace
sunshade
required
a
little
attention
she
took
up
an
elaborate
little
case
for
work
implements
that
lay
on
the
table
and
selected
a
needle
and
thread
and
a
thimble
and
perhaps
the
dead
silence
about
her
oppressed
her
a
little
unconsciously
to
herself
for
she
hummed
as
she
did
so
a
bar
or
two
of
the
waltz
she
had
shut
out
as
she
shut
the
door
then
with
the
needle
moving
deftly
to
and
fro
in
her
white
hands
she
moved
down
the
and
standing
in
the
light
for
the
sake
of
her
work
she
spoke
through
the
doorway
into
the
still
dark
bedroom
cloughtons
have
been
here
william
she
said
people
i
met
in
rome
this
winter
i
think
i
told
you
i
they
wanted
us
to
go
to
la
turbie
with
them
this
afternoon
and
i
said
we
would
that
is
to
say
i
only
answered
conditionally
for
you
of
course
will
you
go
there
was
no
answer
no
sound
of
any
kind
not
so
much
as
a
stir
or
a
rustle
to
indicate
that
the
sleep
of
the
man
hidden
in
the
dimness
beyond
and
only
sleep
surely
could
account
for
his
silence
was
even
broken
by
the
words
addressed
to
him
yet
the
voice
which
proceeded
from
the
serene
little
figure
standing
in
the
sombre
light
of
the
with
its
attention
more
or
less
given
to
the
trivial
work
in
its
hands
was
penetrating
in
its
quality
though
not
loud
romayne
paused
a
moment
listening
then
with
that
expressive
movement
of
her
eyebrows
she
went
back
again
to
the
she
had
left
took
up
a
little
pair
of
scissors
which
were
necessary
to
give
the
finishing
touch
to
her
work
gave
that
finishing
touch
with
careless
deliberation
studied
the
effect
with
satisfaction
and
then
laid
down
the
sunshade
and
returned
to
the
doorway
into
the
bedroom
she
stood
on
the
threshold
this
time
and
the
darkness
before
her
and
the
sombre
light
behind
her
seemed
to
meet
upon
her
figure
the
silence
and
stillness
all
about
her
seemed
to
claim
even
the
space
she
occupied
she
said
crisply
again
there
was
no
answer
no
sound
or
stir
of
any
sort
or
kind
and
for
the
first
time
the
silence
seemed
to
strike
her
she
moved
quickly
forward
into
the
dimness
are
you
asleep
her
eyes
had
fallen
on
the
bed
and
she
stopped
suddenly
for
it
was
empty
she
paused
an
instant
and
in
that
instant
the
silence
seemed
to
rise
and
dominate
the
atmosphere
as
with
a
grim
and
mighty
presence
before
which
everything
shallow
or
superficial
sank
into
insignificance
all
that
was
typical
and
conventional
about
the
woman
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
stillness
arrested
by
she
knew
not
what
suddenly
seemed
to
stand
out
jarring
and
incongruous
as
though
unreality
had
been
met
and
touched
into
by
a
great
reality
then
it
subsided
altogether
and
only
the
simplest
elements
of
womanhood
were
left
the
womanhood
common
to
the
peasant
and
the
princess
as
the
wife
took
two
or
three
quick
steps
forward
she
turned
the
corner
of
the
bed
that
hid
the
greater
part
of
the
room
from
her
and
then
staggered
back
with
a
sharp
cry
at
her
feet
partly
dressed
there
lay
the
figure
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
been
talking
his
right
hand
dropped
straight
by
his
side
clenched
a
revolver
his
face
a
handsome
face
probably
an
hour
ago
was
white
and
fixed
his
eyes
were
glassy
on
the
floor
beside
him
lay
an
open
letter
a
letter
written
on
blue
paper
william
romayne
was
asleep
indeed
his
wife
might
tear
at
the
the
hotel
servants
might
hurry
and
rush
to
and
fro
even
the
englishman
might
render
his
assistance
but
it
was
all
in
vain
william
romayne
was
beyond
their
reach
chapter
ii
the
long
railway
journey
from
paris
to
nice
was
nearly
over
the
passengers
jaded
and
tired
out
for
the
most
part
after
a
night
in
the
train
were
beginning
to
rouse
to
a
languid
interest
in
the
landscape
to
become
aware
that
dawn
and
the
uncomfortable
and
unfamiliar
early
day
had
some
time
since
given
place
to
a
fuller
and
maturer
light
and
to
consult
their
watches
reminding
themselves
or
one
another
as
the
case
might
be
that
they
were
due
at
nice
at
alone
in
one
of
the
carriages
was
a
passenger
who
had
accepted
the
situation
with
the
most
indifference
from
first
to
last
he
had
made
his
arrangements
for
the
night
with
the
skill
and
deliberation
of
an
experienced
traveller
and
as
the
morning
advanced
he
had
composed
himself
as
comfortably
as
circumstances
permitted
in
a
corner
of
his
carriage
now
and
then
casting
a
keen
comprehensive
glance
at
the
country
through
which
he
was
being
carried
these
glances
however
were
evidently
instinctive
and
almost
unconscious
for
the
most
part
he
gazed
straight
before
him
with
a
preoccupied
frown
and
a
grave
and
anxious
expression
in
marked
contrast
with
his
physical
imperturbability
he
was
a
man
of
apparently
three
or
tall
rather
lean
than
thin
and
very
his
face
and
the
right
hand
from
which
he
had
pulled
off
the
glove
were
bronzed
a
deep
and
he
wore
a
long
brown
beard
but
he
was
not
otherwise
his
eyes
indeed
were
very
keen
and
steady
but
the
rest
of
his
face
conveyed
the
impression
that
he
owed
these
characteristics
rather
to
trained
habits
of
material
observation
than
to
general
intellectual
depths
the
mouth
was
firm
and
strong
but
neither
sensitive
nor
sympathetic
and
the
straight
nose
was
as
distinctly
too
thin
as
the
rather
high
forehead
was
too
narrow
on
a
on
the
seat
beside
him
was
the
name
dennis
falconer
the
train
steamed
slowly
into
the
station
at
nice
at
last
the
traveller
stepped
out
on
to
the
platform
and
the
shade
of
grave
preoccupation
which
had
touched
him
seemed
to
descend
on
him
more
heavily
and
as
he
did
so
he
was
walking
down
the
platform
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
when
he
was
stopped
by
a
quick
exclamation
from
a
little
wiry
man
with
a
shrewd
clever
face
who
had
just
come
into
the
station
as
alive
he
cried
met
my
boy
the
gravity
of
the
younger
face
relaxed
for
the
moment
into
a
smile
of
astonishment
aston
he
exclaimed
i
was
thinking
of
looking
you
up
in
london
no
idea
you
were
abroad
the
other
man
laughed
a
very
pleasant
jovial
laugh
taking
a
holiday
he
said
know
that
any
particular
right
to
it
but
i
know
these
places
and
i
took
it
into
my
head
that
i
should
like
to
have
a
look
at
a
carnival
in
nice
and
you
my
boy
just
back
from
africa
you
are
i
know
come
for
the
carnival
by
way
of
a
change
eh
face
altered
he
said
gravely
and
with
a
good
deal
of
restraint
not
come
for
pleasure
very
much
the
reverse
sorry
to
he
paused
apparently
intending
to
say
no
more
on
the
subject
but
the
keen
kindly
interest
in
his
face
or
something
magnetic
about
the
man
influenced
him
in
spite
of
himself
know
whether
the
facts
about
this
bank
business
are
known
here
yet
he
said
if
they
are
understand
aston
when
i
tell
you
that
i
and
my
old
uncle
are
the
only
male
relations
of
william
a
quick
flash
of
grave
intelligence
passed
across
face
he
hesitated
and
glanced
dubiously
at
the
younger
man
did
you
leave
london
he
said
abruptly
morning
was
the
somewhat
surprised
reply
come
in
good
time
my
boy
said
aston
very
gravely
romayne
wants
a
relation
with
her
if
ever
she
did
in
her
life
was
her
husband
ever
a
friend
of
yours
dennis
have
never
met
him
i
know
very
little
even
of
his
wife
what
is
it
doctor
romayne
shot
himself
yesterday
morning
a
short
sharp
exclamation
broke
from
falconer
and
then
there
was
a
total
silence
between
the
two
men
as
the
sudden
unspeakable
horror
in
face
resolved
itself
into
a
shocked
almost
awestruck
gravity
am
thankful
to
have
met
you
he
said
at
last
in
a
low
stern
voice
i
am
more
than
thankful
that
i
he
held
out
his
hand
as
he
spoke
as
though
what
he
had
heard
impelled
him
to
go
on
his
way
and
aston
wrung
it
with
warm
sympathy
shall
meet
again
he
said
me
know
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
i
am
staying
at
the
grave
and
stern
but
not
apparently
shaken
or
rendered
nervous
by
the
news
he
had
heard
or
by
the
prospect
of
the
meeting
before
him
as
a
sympathetic
or
emotional
man
must
have
been
dennis
falconer
strode
out
of
the
station
grave
and
stern
he
reached
his
destination
and
enquired
for
romayne
his
question
was
answered
by
the
proprietor
himself
supplemented
by
ejaculations
from
attendant
waiters
in
a
tone
in
which
sympathetic
interest
familiarity
and
even
a
certain
amount
of
resentment
were
inextricably
blended
monsieur
would
see
madame
romayne
pauvre
of
a
demeanour
so
beautiful
yes
even
in
these
frightful
circumstances
so
beautiful
and
so
distinguished
monsieur
had
but
just
arrived
from
england
monsieur
had
then
perhaps
not
heard
monsieur
was
aware
he
was
a
kinsman
of
madame
monsieur
would
then
doubtless
appreciate
the
so
great
inconvenience
occasioned
the
damage
sustained
by
one
of
the
first
hotels
in
nice
by
the
event
monsieur
would
see
madame
at
once
but
yes
madame
was
visible
there
was
in
fact
a
monsieur
with
her
even
now
an
english
monsieur
from
the
english
scotland
yard
madame
had
sent
but
monsieur
was
indeed
in
haste
monsieur
left
no
possibility
of
doubt
on
that
score
the
waiter
told
off
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
on
the
vigorous
demonstration
to
that
effect
evoked
by
the
mention
of
the
monsieur
from
scotland
yard
had
to
hasten
his
usual
pace
considerably
to
keep
ahead
of
those
quick
firm
footsteps
and
it
was
almost
breathlessly
that
he
at
last
threw
open
a
door
at
the
end
of
a
long
corridor
name
is
public
property
in
connection
with
the
affair
then
in
london
since
yesterday
morning
the
words
spoken
in
a
hard
thin
voice
came
to
ear
as
the
door
opened
and
the
announcement
kinsman
of
madame
passed
unheeded
as
he
moved
hastily
forward
into
the
room
it
was
a
small
private
evidently
by
no
means
the
best
in
the
hotel
with
his
back
to
the
door
stood
a
young
man
in
an
attitude
of
professional
calm
rather
belied
by
a
certain
nervous
fingering
of
the
hat
he
held
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
found
his
position
a
somewhat
embarrassing
one
facing
him
and
indirectly
facing
the
door
stood
romayne
she
was
dressed
in
black
from
head
to
foot
but
the
gown
she
wore
was
one
that
she
had
had
in
her
wardrobe
very
fashionably
made
with
no
trace
of
mourning
about
it
other
than
its
hue
emphasized
perhaps
by
the
incongruity
of
her
conventional
smartness
but
a
result
of
the
past
hours
independent
of
any
such
emphasis
all
the
more
salient
points
of
her
demeanour
of
the
day
before
seemed
to
be
accentuated
into
hardness
her
perfect
as
she
faced
the
young
man
before
her
it
was
the
man
she
had
noticed
on
the
previous
morning
questioning
the
waiter
was
hard
her
perfect
freedom
from
any
touch
of
emotion
or
agitation
was
hard
her
face
a
little
sharpened
and
haggard
and
reddened
slightly
about
the
eyelids
apparently
rather
from
want
of
sleep
than
from
tears
was
very
hard
her
eyes
brighter
than
usual
and
her
rather
thin
mouth
were
eloquent
of
bitterness
rather
than
desolation
of
spirit
she
turned
quickly
towards
the
door
as
falconer
entered
and
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
with
an
unrecognising
stare
then
as
he
advanced
to
her
without
speaking
and
with
outstretched
hand
something
that
was
almost
a
spasm
of
comprehension
passed
across
her
face
settling
into
a
stiff
little
society
smile
is
dennis
falconer
it
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
ought
to
have
known
you
at
once
i
am
very
glad
to
see
uncle
thought
we
decided
yesterday
morning
dennis
falconer
hesitated
and
stopped
he
was
thrown
out
of
his
reckoning
taken
hopelessly
aback
as
it
were
by
something
so
entirely
unlike
what
he
had
expected
as
was
her
whole
bearing
though
indeed
he
had
been
quite
unconscious
of
expecting
anything
but
romayne
remained
completely
mistress
of
the
situation
is
very
kind
of
you
she
said
with
the
same
hard
composure
was
very
kind
of
my
she
hesitated
hardly
perceptibly
and
then
said
the
lines
about
her
mouth
growing
more
bitter
have
heard
falconer
bowed
his
head
in
assent
and
she
turned
toward
the
young
man
who
had
drawn
a
little
apart
during
this
colloquy
gentleman
comes
from
scotland
yard
she
said
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
go
into
matters
with
him
i
do
not
understand
business
or
legal
details
falconer
will
represent
me
she
added
to
the
young
man
who
bowed
with
an
alacrity
that
suggested
as
did
his
glance
at
falconer
that
the
prospect
of
conferring
with
a
man
rather
than
a
woman
was
a
distinct
relief
to
him
then
before
not
very
rapid
mind
had
adjusted
itself
to
the
situation
she
had
bowed
slightly
to
the
young
man
and
left
the
room
chapter
iii
three
days
before
the
name
of
william
romayne
had
been
widely
known
and
respected
throughout
europe
as
the
name
of
a
successful
and
distinguished
financier
now
it
was
the
centre
of
a
wonder
as
the
name
of
a
master
swindler
detected
a
bank
established
in
london
within
the
last
twelve
months
in
connection
with
a
company
offering
an
exceptionally
high
rate
of
interest
had
suddenly
suspended
payment
the
circumstances
were
so
ordinary
and
the
explanation
offered
so
plausible
that
at
first
no
suspicion
of
underhand
dealings
presented
itself
it
was
in
connection
with
the
first
whispers
which
ran
like
wildfire
through
financial
london
of
something
beneath
the
surface
that
it
first
became
known
that
william
romayne
had
some
connection
as
yet
undefined
by
rumour
with
the
bank
in
question
a
fact
hitherto
quite
unknown
the
whispers
grew
with
rapidity
which
was
almost
incredible
even
to
the
whisperers
into
a
definite
and
authentic
shout
of
accusation
and
with
the
exposure
of
an
outline
of
such
daring
and
ingenious
fraud
as
had
not
been
perpetrated
for
many
a
day
another
fact
had
become
public
property
the
exposure
had
been
brought
about
by
an
incredibly
blunder
on
the
part
of
the
master
mind
by
which
the
whole
affair
had
been
conceived
william
was
the
master
mind
and
william
romayne
in
trying
to
overreach
alike
his
dupes
and
his
confederates
had
overreached
himself
his
own
hand
had
created
the
clue
which
had
led
eventually
to
the
ruin
of
the
scheme
he
had
originated
his
death
with
the
news
of
which
the
london
stock
exchange
was
ringing
only
a
few
hours
after
it
was
known
in
nice
was
the
forfeit
paid
by
a
strong
nature
to
which
success
in
all
its
undertakings
was
the
very
salt
of
life
romayne
on
leaving
the
passed
along
the
passages
to
her
own
room
not
that
which
she
had
entered
hours
before
to
consult
with
her
husband
as
to
the
pleasure
expedition
of
the
afternoon
her
face
and
manner
altering
not
at
all
her
composure
was
evidently
neither
forced
nor
unreal
the
emotion
created
in
her
by
the
tragic
circumstances
through
which
she
was
living
was
obviously
not
the
heartbroken
shame
and
despair
naturally
to
be
attributed
to
a
wife
so
situated
but
a
bitter
and
burning
resentment
had
william
romayne
passed
away
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
or
by
any
violent
accident
his
widow
would
have
mourned
him
with
conventional
lamentation
and
with
a
certain
amount
of
genuine
regret
he
had
committed
suicide
as
the
letter
lying
by
his
side
revealed
to
his
wife
even
while
she
hardly
realised
that
he
was
indeed
dead
as
his
only
way
of
escape
from
the
consequences
of
fraud
on
the
brink
of
detection
and
his
attitude
to
his
memory
under
these
circumstances
was
the
natural
outcome
of
the
character
of
their
married
life
hermia
stirling
at
nineteen
had
been
a
pretty
practical
girl
with
her
rather
shallow
nature
somewhat
prematurely
matured
she
had
been
an
orphan
from
her
babyhood
and
having
no
near
relations
in
england
her
nineteen
years
of
life
had
been
lived
under
varied
auspices
resulting
in
more
desultory
education
moral
as
well
as
mental
than
was
good
for
her
the
most
impressionable
of
those
years
however
those
from
fourteen
to
nineteen
had
been
passed
with
connections
of
her
young
and
wealthy
society
women
with
no
ideas
beyond
society
life
and
with
little
perceptible
principle
but
that
of
social
expediency
hermia
was
just
nineteen
just
out
and
taking
to
the
life
before
her
with
the
ease
and
zest
of
a
born
woman
of
the
world
when
one
of
these
ladies
died
and
the
other
married
and
went
away
to
america
with
her
husband
at
this
juncture
the
guardian
her
only
brother
returned
from
india
to
settle
in
london
with
his
only
child
a
girl
two
years
older
than
hermia
and
it
was
obvious
that
his
home
must
be
also
but
neither
old
falconer
nor
his
daughter
had
the
slightest
taste
or
capacity
for
fashionable
life
and
before
she
had
spent
six
months
with
them
the
world
had
become
to
hermia
an
insufferably
dull
and
tiresome
place
she
had
known
william
romayne
in
society
he
was
rich
he
was
handsome
and
he
was
very
popular
there
was
that
indefinable
something
about
him
manner
magnetism
or
tact
which
constitutes
a
kind
of
dominating
charm
he
was
not
the
less
in
that
he
was
vaguely
understood
to
be
a
business
man
of
some
sort
with
dealings
in
shares
and
stocks
all
over
the
world
a
locality
which
lent
a
picturesque
haziness
to
his
affairs
consequently
when
he
followed
hermia
into
her
new
life
and
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
passed
over
the
fact
that
he
was
years
her
senior
and
consented
with
the
practical
promptitude
of
a
nature
for
which
romance
and
sentiment
were
not
for
eighteen
months
she
and
her
husband
had
lived
in
a
large
house
in
eaton
square
entertaining
and
being
entertained
through
two
brilliant
seasons
which
took
away
any
girlishness
which
hermia
had
ever
possessed
and
gave
her
qualities
which
she
admired
infinitely
more
she
found
her
husband
very
pleasant
very
easy
to
live
with
and
after
the
first
six
months
quite
unexacting
his
business
took
him
into
the
city
every
day
at
this
time
though
as
his
wife
said
complacently
he
was
not
the
least
like
the
ordinary
city
man
but
at
the
end
of
the
season
which
followed
on
the
birth
of
their
child
he
announced
that
he
would
have
to
spend
certainly
six
months
possibly
more
in
america
he
showed
no
ardent
desire
to
take
his
wife
with
him
and
his
wife
had
no
desire
whatever
to
go
she
wanted
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
summer
at
one
of
the
fashionable
health
resorts
and
to
winter
in
rome
such
an
arrangement
was
accordingly
made
between
them
in
the
simplest
most
way
arguing
no
shadow
of
on
either
side
and
during
the
four
years
which
had
elapsed
since
then
husband
and
wife
had
each
gone
his
or
her
own
way
meeting
when
occasion
served
for
a
month
or
two
at
a
time
now
in
london
now
in
paris
now
in
rome
and
presumably
finding
the
arrangement
mutually
satisfactory
the
little
boy
had
been
left
for
the
most
part
to
the
care
of
cousin
frances
falconer
romayne
regarded
him
with
the
careless
affection
of
a
woman
to
whom
her
child
owes
nothing
but
bare
life
to
whom
its
arrival
in
the
world
has
been
rather
a
tiresome
interlude
merely
in
her
round
of
pleasures
and
pursuits
who
has
had
no
time
since
and
has
seen
no
occasion
to
make
time
to
give
it
that
care
which
other
people
as
it
seemed
to
her
could
give
it
quite
as
well
as
she
and
who
is
waiting
vaguely
until
it
shall
be
up
to
find
it
interesting
that
her
had
taken
him
in
the
course
of
those
four
years
into
every
corner
of
the
globe
where
the
passing
of
money
from
hand
to
hand
is
elevated
into
a
science
romayne
knew
and
with
that
fact
her
knowledge
of
his
affairs
began
and
ended
he
made
her
an
ample
allowance
whenever
they
met
she
found
him
the
same
handsome
rather
callous
but
withal
fascinating
man
clever
with
a
cleverness
which
she
could
appreciate
the
cleverness
which
made
money
and
held
a
position
in
society
and
she
had
asked
nothing
more
of
him
her
regard
for
him
if
regard
that
could
be
called
which
was
more
truly
indifference
had
been
founded
on
appreciation
of
his
success
before
failure
before
the
social
disgrace
which
must
be
the
lot
of
a
detected
swindler
and
suicide
it
disappeared
totally
and
instantaneously
to
be
replaced
by
a
burning
sense
of
personal
outrage
and
insult
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
she
left
her
room
again
dennis
falconer
received
a
message
to
the
effect
that
romayne
was
sure
that
he
must
be
tired
and
begged
that
he
would
not
think
of
her
until
he
had
lunched
and
rested
when
she
did
reappear
she
was
in
weeds
and
the
contrast
between
her
dress
with
its
tragic
significance
of
desolation
and
her
face
untouched
with
feeling
was
inexpressible
dennis
falconer
was
in
the
when
she
entered
it
his
sense
of
duty
was
largely
developed
and
he
was
also
keenly
sensible
of
the
moral
aspect
of
the
affair
with
which
he
was
brought
into
such
close
contact
the
first
of
these
senses
kept
him
in
waiting
in
anticipation
of
the
appearance
of
the
woman
for
whose
assistance
he
was
there
and
the
second
weighed
so
heavily
upon
him
that
the
publicity
of
the
hotel
would
have
been
intolerable
to
him
under
the
circumstances
he
rose
quickly
as
romayne
came
in
a
look
of
slight
constraint
on
his
face
dennis
falconer
had
no
near
relation
and
perhaps
this
absence
of
close
ties
to
england
had
had
something
to
do
with
his
adoption
of
the
life
of
a
traveller
and
explorer
in
connection
with
the
royal
geographical
society
old
falconer
uncle
was
his
second
cousin
only
though
the
younger
man
had
been
brought
up
to
address
him
as
uncle
but
in
so
small
a
clan
distant
relationship
counts
for
more
than
in
a
family
where
first
cousins
and
brothers
and
sisters
abound
and
there
was
nothing
strange
to
dennis
falconer
or
to
romayne
in
the
fact
of
his
coming
to
her
support
even
though
they
hardly
knew
one
another
but
falconer
had
been
chilled
and
even
repelled
by
her
manner
of
the
morning
and
he
was
very
conscious
now
of
having
his
acquaintance
to
make
and
of
approaching
the
process
with
a
vague
prejudice
against
her
in
his
mind
this
prejudice
was
not
dissipated
by
her
first
words
spoken
with
a
suavity
somewhat
low
in
pitch
truly
but
with
a
tacit
ignoring
of
the
significance
of
their
meeting
which
seemed
to
the
man
she
addressed
to
whom
society
life
with
its
obligations
and
conventionalities
was
practically
an
unknown
quantity
simply
jarring
and
unsuitable
hope
you
are
rested
she
said
suppose
though
that
to
such
a
traveller
as
you
are
the
journey
from
london
to
nice
is
nothing
i
hear
from
frances
constantly
about
your
exploits
and
she
tells
me
that
we
are
to
expect
great
things
of
you
what
a
long
time
it
is
since
we
met
she
sat
down
as
she
spoke
with
a
hard
little
smile
and
falconer
murmured
something
almost
unintelligible
thinking
that
his
manner
arose
from
mere
embarrassment
instinct
dictated
to
her
to
set
him
at
his
ease
and
with
no
faintest
comprehension
of
his
attitude
of
mind
she
proceeded
to
chat
to
him
about
his
own
affairs
asking
him
questions
which
elicited
coherent
answers
indeed
but
answers
which
grew
terser
and
sterner
until
she
thought
indifferently
that
her
cousin
was
a
rather
heavy
person
at
last
there
came
a
pause
a
pause
during
which
falconer
gazed
grimly
and
uncomfortably
at
the
floor
and
when
romayne
broke
it
it
was
with
a
different
tone
and
manner
hard
and
detective
told
you
more
than
he
told
me
possibly
she
said
there
is
anything
more
for
me
to
hear
i
should
like
to
hear
it
you
had
better
i
think
read
this
letter
romayne
received
it
yesterday
she
handed
him
that
letter
written
on
blue
paper
which
had
lain
by
the
dead
side
and
falconer
took
it
in
silence
the
letter
was
from
one
of
william
confederates
it
was
the
desperate
letter
of
a
desperate
man
who
knew
himself
to
be
addressing
the
man
to
whom
he
was
to
owe
ruin
and
disgrace
the
crisis
had
evidently
been
so
wholly
unexpected
that
detection
was
actually
imminent
before
the
criminals
recognised
it
as
even
possible
the
gist
of
the
letter
was
contained
in
the
statement
that
before
it
met
the
eyes
of
the
man
for
whom
it
was
intended
the
whole
scheme
would
be
exploded
falconer
read
it
through
his
face
very
stern
he
finished
it
and
refolded
it
still
in
silence
and
romayne
said
in
a
dry
thin
voice
bears
out
as
you
see
what
the
detective
no
doubt
told
you
that
there
was
so
little
ground
for
suspicion
three
days
ago
that
he
was
sent
out
merely
to
watch
and
without
even
a
warrant
he
found
a
telegram
waiting
for
him
here
from
his
authorities
yesterday
told
me
so
answered
falconer
distantly
and
constrainedly
handing
her
back
the
letter
as
he
spoke
without
comment
is
not
the
faintest
possibility
of
hushing
it
up
i
conclude
she
asked
in
the
same
hard
voice
falconer
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
the
indefinite
disapprobation
of
her
which
had
been
growing
in
him
almost
with
every
word
she
said
taking
form
in
his
face
in
a
distinct
expression
of
reprobation
the
faintest
he
said
emphatically
do
i
see
that
such
a
possibility
is
in
any
way
to
be
she
glanced
at
him
with
a
quick
movement
of
her
eyebrows
she
did
not
speak
however
and
a
silence
ensued
between
them
one
of
those
uncomfortable
silences
eloquent
of
conscious
want
of
sympathy
it
was
broken
this
time
by
falconer
who
spoke
with
formal
politeness
and
restraint
will
wish
to
get
away
from
this
place
as
soon
as
possible
no
doubt
he
said
may
be
some
slight
delay
before
we
are
put
into
possession
of
the
papers
and
other
effects
at
present
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
here
but
i
will
of
course
do
all
i
can
to
hasten
she
said
papers
oh
you
mean
papers
are
there
any
do
you
think
a
will
i
suppose
will
if
there
is
one
will
be
so
much
waste
paper
i
fear
said
falconer
with
uncompromising
sternness
is
no
chance
of
any
property
being
saved
even
if
it
was
possible
to
wish
for
such
a
thing
but
there
may
be
papers
nevertheless
in
fact
no
doubt
there
must
be
and
you
will
of
course
wish
to
have
said
romayne
thoughtfully
of
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
in
a
dry
constrained
voice
you
mean
me
to
understand
that
i
am
absolutely
penniless
your
own
money
in
your
own
hands
or
in
i
fear
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
such
is
the
falconer
spoke
very
stiffly
and
distantly
and
romayne
rose
from
her
chair
a
little
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
window
when
she
turned
to
him
again
it
was
to
speak
of
the
formalities
necessary
with
the
nice
authorities
and
a
few
moments
later
the
interview
was
ended
by
the
appearance
of
dinner
during
the
few
days
that
followed
the
distance
between
them
which
that
first
interview
established
so
imperceptibly
but
so
certainly
never
lessened
it
grew
indeed
with
their
contact
with
one
another
to
falconer
whole
attitude
of
mind
her
whole
personality
was
simply
and
entirely
antipathetic
that
a
woman
under
such
circumstances
should
speak
and
act
and
think
as
romayne
spoke
and
acted
and
as
far
as
he
could
tell
thought
with
so
little
sense
of
any
but
the
social
aspect
of
her
crime
with
so
little
realisation
of
the
ruin
that
crime
had
brought
to
hundreds
of
innocent
people
with
so
little
moral
feeling
of
any
kind
was
in
the
highest
degree
reprehensible
to
him
having
assumed
a
mental
attitude
of
reprehension
he
stopped
short
his
perceptions
were
not
sufficiently
keen
to
allow
of
his
understanding
that
some
pity
might
be
due
also
suffering
is
not
always
to
be
estimated
by
the
worth
of
the
object
through
which
it
is
inflicted
not
often
indeed
in
this
world
where
the
sum
of
suffering
is
out
of
all
proportion
greater
than
the
sum
of
spirituality
conception
of
life
might
be
in
the
last
degree
narrow
and
selfish
and
as
such
it
might
be
in
the
highest
degree
to
be
deprecated
but
such
as
it
was
it
was
all
she
had
and
within
its
limits
her
life
was
now
in
ruin
her
aims
and
ends
in
life
might
be
of
the
poorest
and
deserving
of
unsparing
condemnation
but
she
had
nothing
beyond
and
the
pain
of
their
overthrow
was
to
her
dormant
sensibility
not
so
very
disproportionate
to
the
suffering
inflicted
on
a
more
sensitive
organisation
by
the
shattering
of
higher
hopes
romayne
for
her
part
found
her
cousin
with
the
reserve
and
formality
of
demeanour
which
the
situation
developed
in
him
simply
a
tiresome
and
uncongenial
companion
he
was
very
attentive
to
her
his
manner
as
she
acknowledged
to
herself
more
than
once
with
a
heavy
sigh
was
excellent
and
he
managed
her
difficult
and
painful
affairs
with
admirable
strength
and
tact
she
learnt
in
the
course
of
those
few
days
to
respect
him
and
depend
on
him
in
spite
of
herself
and
even
against
her
will
but
it
was
not
surprising
that
the
end
of
their
enforced
dual
solitude
should
be
looked
for
more
or
less
eagerly
by
both
parties
they
were
almost
entirely
dependent
on
one
another
for
companionship
falconer
it
is
true
saw
aston
once
or
twice
but
of
acquaintances
not
one
had
even
left
a
card
of
condolence
upon
her
neither
the
cloughtons
nor
any
other
of
the
who
had
previously
been
so
anxious
for
her
society
showed
any
sign
of
being
aware
of
her
existence
under
her
present
circumstances
the
form
taken
by
first
allusion
to
the
probable
limits
of
their
detention
in
nice
had
created
in
both
of
them
by
one
of
those
vague
chains
of
idea
which
are
so
unaccountable
and
so
often
experienced
a
tendency
to
think
and
speak
of
the
termination
of
that
detention
when
they
did
speak
together
on
the
subject
as
the
papers
are
given
there
was
some
question
at
one
time
as
to
whether
or
no
even
the
private
papers
of
william
romayne
would
be
returned
to
his
widow
and
these
same
papers
thus
surrounded
by
an
element
of
painful
uncertainty
and
at
the
same
time
elevated
into
a
kind
of
order
of
release
obtained
in
the
minds
of
both
a
fictitious
importance
on
their
own
account
romayne
found
herself
thinking
about
them
conjecturing
about
them
even
dreaming
about
them
until
at
last
when
they
were
actually
placed
in
her
hand
they
possessed
a
curious
fascination
for
her
it
was
about
midday
when
she
and
falconer
returned
from
their
final
appearance
before
the
authorities
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
holding
the
large
shabby
lately
handed
to
her
with
a
grave
papers
the
noise
of
the
carnival
floated
in
at
the
window
in
striking
contrast
with
the
two
sombre
figures
think
i
will
go
and
look
them
over
she
said
in
a
low
rather
surprised
voice
would
like
to
go
out
perhaps
please
think
about
me
i
will
spend
the
day
quietly
he
answered
her
courteously
and
she
left
the
room
slowly
with
her
eyes
fixed
curiously
on
the
in
her
hand
chapter
iv
romayne
carried
the
to
her
bedroom
and
set
it
down
on
a
small
table
she
and
falconer
were
leaving
nice
on
the
following
morning
and
her
maid
was
just
finishing
her
packing
romayne
inspected
the
arrangements
gave
her
sundry
orders
and
then
dismissed
her
left
alone
she
made
one
or
two
trifling
preparations
for
the
journey
on
her
own
account
and
when
these
were
completed
to
her
satisfaction
she
drew
the
table
on
which
she
had
placed
the
to
the
open
window
and
seated
herself
she
drew
the
box
towards
her
and
unlocked
it
and
there
was
nothing
in
her
face
as
she
did
so
but
the
hard
resentment
which
had
grown
upon
it
during
the
last
few
days
just
touched
by
an
indefinite
and
equally
hard
curiosity
the
interest
which
those
papers
possessed
for
her
had
been
created
by
purely
artificial
means
intrinsically
they
were
nothing
to
her
the
position
which
the
possession
of
them
had
occupied
in
her
thoughts
lately
was
the
sole
source
of
the
impulse
under
which
she
was
acting
now
under
any
other
circumstances
she
might
hardly
have
cared
to
look
at
them
she
raised
the
lid
and
paused
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
compact
mass
of
papers
within
with
a
sudden
vague
touch
of
more
personal
interest
the
box
was
nearly
full
the
various
sets
of
papers
were
carefully
and
methodically
fastened
together
and
endorsed
evidently
upon
a
system
romayne
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
took
out
a
packet
at
random
it
consisted
of
bills
all
bearing
dates
within
the
last
six
months
all
sent
in
by
leading
london
tradesmen
and
all
for
large
amounts
romayne
glanced
at
the
figures
and
her
eyebrows
moved
with
an
expression
of
slight
surprise
which
was
almost
immediately
dominated
by
bitter
acceptance
and
comprehension
she
opened
none
however
until
she
came
to
one
bearing
the
name
of
a
london
jeweller
she
read
the
name
and
the
amount
of
the
bill
and
paused
then
a
new
curiosity
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
unfolded
the
paper
quickly
the
account
was
a
very
long
one
and
as
her
eyes
travelled
quickly
down
it
taking
in
item
after
item
a
dull
red
colour
crept
into
her
face
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
contemptuous
resentment
she
was
evidently
surprised
and
yet
with
herself
for
being
surprised
of
the
items
in
the
bill
in
her
hand
were
for
articles
of
jewellery
not
worn
by
men
and
not
one
of
these
had
ever
been
seen
by
william
wife
she
stuffed
the
paper
back
into
its
fastening
tossed
the
bundle
away
and
took
another
packet
from
the
box
with
quickened
interest
it
consisted
of
miscellaneous
documents
all
likewise
connected
with
her
life
in
london
during
the
past
winter
but
of
no
particular
interest
the
next
packet
she
opened
was
of
the
same
nature
and
with
that
the
top
layer
of
the
box
came
to
an
end
the
papers
below
were
evidently
older
of
varying
ages
indeed
to
judge
from
their
varying
tints
of
yellow
disarranging
a
lower
layer
in
taking
out
the
packet
nearest
to
her
hand
romayne
saw
that
there
were
older
papers
still
beneath
and
realised
that
the
box
before
her
contained
the
private
papers
of
many
years
probably
all
the
private
papers
which
william
romayne
had
preserved
throughout
his
life
she
opened
the
packet
she
had
drawn
out
hastily
and
with
an
angry
glitter
in
her
eyes
it
consisted
of
documents
not
likely
as
it
seemed
to
be
of
any
interest
to
her
she
glanced
through
the
first
unheedingly
enough
and
then
as
she
reached
the
end
something
seemed
suddenly
to
touch
her
attention
she
paused
a
moment
with
a
startled
incredulous
expression
on
her
face
and
began
to
it
slowly
and
carefully
she
read
it
to
the
end
again
and
her
face
as
she
finished
was
a
little
pale
and
she
freed
another
paper
from
the
packet
almost
mechanically
with
an
absorbed
preoccupied
look
in
her
eyes
opened
it
and
read
it
with
a
strained
hardly
comprehending
attention
which
grew
gradually
and
imperceptibly
as
she
went
on
from
paper
to
paper
into
a
kind
of
stupefied
horror
she
finished
the
thick
packet
in
her
hands
and
then
she
paused
lifting
her
pale
face
for
a
moment
and
gazing
straight
before
her
with
an
indescribable
expression
on
its
shallow
hardness
as
though
she
was
realising
something
almost
incredibly
bitter
and
repugnant
to
her
and
was
stunned
by
the
realisation
then
her
instincts
and
habits
of
life
and
thought
seemed
to
assert
themselves
as
it
were
and
to
dominate
the
situation
her
expression
changed
the
stupefied
look
gave
place
to
what
was
little
deeper
than
bitter
excitement
a
patch
of
angry
colour
succeeded
the
pallor
of
a
moment
earlier
and
her
eyes
glittered
turning
to
the
again
she
proceeded
to
ransack
it
with
a
hasty
eagerness
of
touch
which
differed
markedly
from
the
careless
composure
of
her
earlier
proceedings
paper
after
paper
was
torn
open
glanced
through
sometimes
even
with
a
feverish
attention
and
tossed
aside
sometimes
with
a
sudden
deepening
of
that
angry
flush
sometimes
with
a
movement
of
the
lips
as
though
an
interjection
formed
itself
upon
them
always
with
a
heightening
of
her
excitement
until
one
packet
only
remained
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
romayne
snatched
it
out
and
then
started
slightly
as
she
saw
that
it
did
not
consist
as
the
majority
of
the
others
had
done
of
business
papers
but
of
letters
in
a
handwriting
nor
was
it
so
old
as
many
of
the
papers
she
had
looked
at
some
of
which
had
borne
dates
years
back
she
opened
it
with
a
sudden
hardening
of
her
excitement
which
seemed
to
mark
the
change
from
almost
impersonal
to
intensely
personal
interest
she
saw
that
the
date
was
that
of
the
second
year
after
her
marriage
that
each
letter
was
annotated
in
her
writing
and
then
she
began
deliberately
to
read
her
lips
very
thin
and
set
her
eyes
cold
and
hard
she
read
the
letters
all
through
with
every
comment
inscribed
on
them
and
by
the
time
she
laid
the
last
upon
the
table
her
very
lips
were
white
with
vindictive
feeling
strangely
incongruous
on
her
little
conventional
face
she
sat
quite
still
for
a
moment
and
then
rose
abruptly
and
stood
by
the
window
with
her
back
to
the
table
looking
out
upon
the
evening
sky
the
strength
of
feeling
died
out
of
her
face
however
in
the
course
of
a
very
few
minutes
leaving
it
only
very
white
and
rather
as
though
she
had
received
a
series
of
shocks
which
had
made
a
mark
even
on
material
so
difficult
to
impress
as
her
artificial
personality
and
she
turned
and
contemplated
the
table
littered
now
with
documents
of
all
sorts
as
though
she
saw
not
the
actual
heaps
of
papers
but
something
beyond
them
contemptible
and
disgusting
to
her
beyond
expression
then
suddenly
she
moved
forward
crammed
the
papers
indiscriminately
into
the
forced
down
the
lid
and
carried
the
box
out
of
the
room
down
the
stairs
towards
the
where
she
had
left
dennis
falconer
it
was
an
impulse
not
wholly
consistent
with
the
of
her
ordinary
manner
but
that
manner
had
been
acquired
in
a
world
where
shocks
and
difficulties
were
more
or
less
disbelieved
in
face
to
face
with
so
unconventional
a
condition
of
affairs
conventional
instincts
were
necessarily
at
fault
and
there
being
no
strong
motive
power
in
her
to
supply
their
place
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
relieve
herself
by
turning
to
the
man
on
whom
the
past
few
days
had
taught
her
to
rely
dennis
falconer
was
not
in
the
when
she
opened
the
door
but
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
contemplating
the
empty
room
he
came
down
the
corridor
behind
her
you
looking
for
me
he
said
with
distant
courtesy
as
he
reached
her
he
made
a
movement
to
relieve
her
of
the
box
she
carried
and
as
he
did
so
he
was
struck
by
her
expression
there
anything
here
you
wish
me
to
see
he
said
quickly
and
gravely
she
said
she
spoke
in
a
dry
hard
voice
about
which
there
was
a
ring
of
excitement
which
made
him
look
at
her
again
and
realise
vaguely
that
something
was
wrong
he
followed
her
into
the
room
and
she
motioned
to
him
to
put
the
box
on
the
table
have
been
looking
them
over
she
said
indicating
the
papers
with
a
gesture
i
have
brought
them
to
you
they
are
very
she
laughed
a
bitter
crackling
little
laugh
and
the
disapproval
in
ambush
in
dennis
expression
developed
a
little
you
wish
me
to
go
over
them
now
and
with
you
he
enquired
stiffly
with
me
i
think
thank
you
she
answered
the
novel
excitement
about
her
manner
finding
expression
once
more
in
that
harsh
laugh
reading
is
enough
but
now
if
you
mind
there
are
business
points
on
which
i
may
possibly
be
she
did
not
look
as
though
she
spoke
from
conviction
i
should
like
you
to
read
them
i
will
go
out
into
the
garden
it
is
quite
empty
always
at
this
time
and
i
want
some
her
tone
and
the
glance
she
cast
at
the
as
she
spoke
made
it
evident
that
it
was
not
closeness
of
material
atmosphere
alone
that
had
created
the
necessity
will
read
them
now
certainly
if
you
wish
it
he
returned
then
as
she
took
up
a
book
which
lay
on
a
table
with
a
mechanical
gesture
of
acknowledgement
he
opened
the
door
for
her
and
she
went
out
of
the
room
he
came
back
to
the
table
drew
up
a
chair
and
opened
the
two
hours
later
dennis
falconer
was
still
sitting
in
that
same
chair
his
right
hand
which
rested
on
the
table
clenched
until
the
knuckles
were
white
his
face
pale
to
the
very
lips
beneath
its
tan
in
his
eyes
fixed
in
a
kind
of
dreadful
fascination
on
the
piles
of
papers
before
him
there
was
a
look
of
shocked
almost
incredulous
horror
which
seemed
to
touch
all
that
was
narrow
and
dogmatic
about
his
ordinary
expression
into
something
deep
and
almost
solemn
the
door
opened
and
he
started
painfully
it
was
only
the
waiter
with
preliminary
preparations
for
dinner
and
recovering
himself
with
an
effort
falconer
rose
and
slowly
almost
as
though
their
very
touch
was
repugnant
to
him
began
to
replace
the
papers
in
the
box
he
locked
it
and
then
left
the
room
carrying
it
with
him
dinner
was
served
and
romayne
had
been
waiting
some
two
or
three
minutes
before
he
reappeared
he
was
still
pale
and
the
horror
had
rather
settled
down
on
to
his
face
than
left
it
but
it
had
changed
its
character
somewhat
the
breadth
was
gone
from
it
it
was
as
though
he
had
passed
through
a
moment
of
expansion
and
insight
to
contract
again
to
his
ordinary
limits
romayne
was
standing
near
the
window
the
excitement
had
almost
entirely
subsided
from
her
manner
leaving
her
only
harder
and
more
bitter
in
expression
than
she
had
been
three
hours
before
she
glanced
sharply
at
falconer
as
he
came
towards
her
with
a
constrained
conventional
word
or
two
of
apology
answered
him
with
the
words
his
speech
demanded
and
they
sat
down
to
dinner
it
was
a
silent
meal
romayne
made
two
or
three
remarks
on
general
topics
and
asked
one
or
two
questions
as
to
their
journey
of
the
following
day
and
falconer
responded
as
briefly
as
courtesy
allowed
on
his
own
account
he
originated
no
observation
whatever
until
dinner
was
over
and
the
final
disappearance
of
the
waiter
had
been
succeeded
by
a
total
silence
romayne
was
still
sitting
opposite
him
one
elbow
resting
on
the
table
her
head
leaning
on
her
hand
as
she
absently
played
with
some
grapes
on
which
her
eyes
were
fixed
falconer
glanced
across
at
her
once
or
twice
evidently
with
a
growing
conviction
that
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
speak
and
with
a
growing
uncertainty
as
to
what
he
should
say
this
latter
condition
of
things
helped
to
make
his
tone
even
unusually
formal
and
dogmatic
as
he
said
at
last
i
fear
must
seem
almost
a
farce
she
glanced
up
quickly
her
eyes
very
bright
and
hard
she
said
drily
know
that
there
is
any
new
call
for
sympathy
is
there
after
all
things
are
very
much
where
they
were
a
kind
of
shock
passed
across
face
a
materialisation
of
a
mental
process
we
know
now
he
began
stiffly
we
knew
before
was
quite
enough
interrupted
romayne
one
has
arrived
violently
at
the
foot
of
the
precipice
it
is
of
no
particular
moment
how
long
one
has
been
living
on
the
edge
while
nothing
was
known
romayne
was
only
on
the
edge
and
as
no
one
knew
of
the
precipice
it
was
practically
as
though
none
existed
directly
one
thing
came
out
it
was
all
over
he
was
over
the
edge
nothing
could
make
it
either
better
or
she
spoke
almost
carelessly
though
very
bitterly
as
though
she
felt
her
words
to
be
almost
truisms
and
falconer
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
said
with
stern
formality
as
though
he
were
making
a
deliberate
effort
to
realise
her
point
of
view
imply
that
fall
his
going
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
if
i
may
adopt
your
figure
consisted
in
the
discovery
of
his
misdeeds
do
you
mean
that
you
think
it
would
have
been
better
if
nothing
had
ever
been
known
romayne
raised
her
eyebrows
course
she
said
amazedly
then
catching
sight
of
her
face
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
little
gesture
of
deprecating
concession
of
course
i
mean
that
romayne
himself
would
have
been
any
better
if
nothing
had
ever
come
out
she
said
impatiently
right
and
wrong
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
would
have
been
the
same
i
suppose
but
i
see
how
ruin
and
suicide
improve
the
she
rose
as
she
spoke
and
falconer
made
no
answer
romayne
had
touched
on
the
great
realities
of
life
the
everlasting
mystery
of
the
spirit
of
man
with
its
unfathomable
obligations
and
disabilities
had
touched
on
them
carelessly
patronisingly
as
that
kind
of
she
was
as
absolutely
blind
to
the
depth
of
their
significance
as
is
a
man
without
eyesight
to
the
illimitable
spaces
of
the
sky
above
him
to
falconer
her
tone
was
simply
scandalising
he
did
not
understand
her
ignorance
he
could
not
touch
the
pathos
of
its
limitations
and
the
possibilities
by
which
it
was
surrounded
the
grim
irony
of
such
a
tone
as
used
by
the
ephemeral
of
the
immutable
was
beyond
his
ken
have
several
things
to
see
to
upstairs
romayne
went
on
after
a
pause
shall
go
up
now
and
i
think
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
not
come
down
again
we
start
so
early
good
night
night
he
returned
stiffly
and
with
a
little
superior
contemptuous
smile
on
her
face
she
went
away
chapter
v
dennis
falconer
had
been
alone
for
nearly
an
hour
when
his
solitude
was
broken
up
by
the
appearance
of
a
waiter
who
presented
him
with
a
card
and
the
information
that
the
gentleman
whose
name
it
bore
was
in
the
the
name
was
and
after
a
reflection
falconer
told
the
waiter
to
ask
the
gentleman
to
come
upstairs
falconer
had
spent
that
last
hour
in
meditation
which
had
grown
steadily
deeper
and
graver
it
seemed
to
have
carried
him
beyond
the
formal
and
dogmatic
attitude
of
mind
with
which
he
had
met
romayne
back
to
the
borders
of
those
larger
regions
he
had
touched
when
he
sat
looking
at
william
papers
and
there
was
a
warmth
and
gratitude
in
his
reception
of
aston
when
that
gentleman
appeared
that
suggested
that
he
was
not
so
completely
sufficient
for
himself
as
usual
is
very
full
i
imagine
he
said
as
he
welcomed
the
little
doctor
cousin
has
gone
to
bed
and
i
thought
if
you
mind
coming
up
doctor
we
should
be
better
off
answer
was
characteristically
hearty
and
alert
knowing
it
to
be
last
night
at
nice
he
had
come
round
he
said
just
for
a
farewell
word
and
to
arrange
if
possible
for
a
meeting
later
on
under
happier
circumstances
a
quiet
chat
over
a
cigar
was
what
he
had
not
hoped
for
but
the
thing
of
all
others
he
would
like
he
settled
himself
with
a
genial
instinct
for
comfort
in
the
falconer
pulled
round
to
the
window
for
him
accepted
a
cigar
and
prepared
to
light
it
glancing
now
and
again
at
the
younger
face
with
shrewd
kindly
eyes
which
had
already
noticed
something
unusual
in
its
expression
aston
and
dennis
falconer
had
met
some
six
years
before
in
africa
under
circumstances
which
had
brought
out
all
that
was
best
in
the
young
character
and
aston
had
been
warmly
attracted
by
him
being
a
particularly
shrewd
student
of
human
nature
he
had
taken
his
measure
accurately
enough
subsequently
and
knew
as
certainly
as
one
man
may
of
another
where
his
weak
points
lay
and
how
time
was
dealing
with
them
but
his
kindness
for
and
interest
in
dennis
falconer
had
never
abated
perhaps
because
his
insight
did
not
as
so
much
human
insight
does
stop
at
the
weak
points
dennis
falconer
for
his
part
regarded
aston
with
an
affectionate
respect
which
he
gave
to
hardly
any
other
man
on
earth
there
was
a
short
silence
as
the
two
men
lit
their
cigars
and
then
aston
with
another
glance
at
face
broke
it
with
a
kindly
delicate
enquiry
after
romayne
falconer
answered
it
almost
absently
but
with
an
instinctive
stiffening
so
to
speak
of
his
face
and
voice
and
there
was
another
pause
the
doctor
was
trying
the
experiment
of
waiting
for
a
lead
he
was
just
deciding
that
he
must
make
another
attempt
on
his
own
account
when
falconer
took
his
cigar
from
between
his
lips
and
said
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
evening
sky
always
glad
to
see
you
doctor
but
i
never
was
more
glad
than
a
sound
proceeded
from
the
doctor
which
might
have
been
described
as
a
grunt
if
it
had
been
less
delicately
sympathetic
and
falconer
continued
been
trying
to
think
out
a
problem
and
it
was
one
too
many
for
me
the
origin
of
he
was
thoroughly
in
earnest
and
nothing
was
further
from
him
than
any
thought
of
lightness
or
flippancy
but
there
was
a
calm
familiarity
and
acquaintanceship
with
his
subject
about
his
tone
that
produced
a
slight
quiver
about
the
corners
of
the
little
mouth
he
did
not
speak
however
and
the
movement
with
which
he
took
his
cigar
from
between
his
lips
and
turned
to
falconer
was
merely
sympathetic
and
interested
course
i
know
an
unprofitable
subject
enough
continued
falconer
almost
apologetically
shall
never
be
much
the
wiser
on
the
subject
struggle
as
we
may
but
still
now
and
then
it
seems
to
be
forced
on
one
it
has
been
forced
on
me
of
william
romayne
suggested
aston
so
delicately
that
the
words
seemed
rather
a
sympathetic
comment
than
a
question
returned
falconer
have
been
looking
through
his
private
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
continued
as
if
drawn
on
almost
in
spite
of
himself
knew
him
by
repute
i
dare
say
doctor
he
had
one
of
those
strong
personalities
which
get
conveyed
even
by
hearsay
a
clever
man
striking
and
dominating
universally
liked
and
deferred
to
yet
he
must
have
been
as
absolutely
without
principle
as
this
table
is
without
he
struck
the
little
table
between
them
with
his
open
hand
as
he
spoke
and
then
as
though
the
expression
of
his
feelings
had
begotten
as
is
often
the
case
an
irresistible
desire
to
relieve
himself
further
he
answered
interested
ejaculation
as
if
it
had
been
the
question
the
doctor
was
at
once
too
and
too
full
of
tact
to
put
were
no
papers
connected
with
this
last
disgraceful
affair
of
course
those
as
you
know
i
dare
say
were
all
seized
in
london
the
past
life
that
these
private
papers
throw
light
on
light
did
i
say
it
was
a
life
of
systematic
villainy
for
which
no
colours
could
be
dark
he
had
uttered
his
last
sentence
involuntarily
as
it
seemed
and
now
he
laid
down
his
cigar
and
turning
to
aston
began
to
speak
low
and
quickly
are
papers
of
all
kinds
he
said
business
documents
memoranda
of
every
description
and
of
them
at
least
have
reference
to
fraud
and
wrong
of
one
kind
or
another
not
one
penny
that
man
possessed
can
have
been
honestly
come
by
his
business
was
swindling
every
one
of
his
business
transactions
was
founded
on
fraud
he
can
have
had
no
faith
or
honesty
of
any
sort
or
kind
he
was
living
with
another
woman
before
he
had
been
married
a
year
all
that
letters
he
deceived
her
abominably
and
fortunate
that
she
died
are
annotated
and
endorsed
like
his
memoranda
evidently
kept
deliberately
as
so
much
stored
experience
for
future
use
aston
had
listened
with
a
keen
alert
expression
of
intent
interest
his
cigar
was
forgotten
and
he
laid
it
down
now
as
if
impatient
of
any
distraction
and
leant
forward
over
the
table
with
his
shrewd
kindly
little
eyes
fixed
eagerly
on
falconer
human
nature
was
a
hobby
of
his
confidence
or
more
truly
perhaps
the
manner
of
it
had
swept
away
all
conventional
barriers
and
the
elder
man
asked
two
or
three
quick
penetrating
questions
far
back
do
these
records
go
he
asked
finally
cover
years
i
should
say
returned
falconer
first
note
on
a
successful
fraud
must
have
been
made
when
he
was
about
why
even
then
when
he
was
a
mere
boy
he
must
have
been
entirely
without
moral
sense
said
the
doctor
with
a
certain
dry
briskness
of
manner
which
was
apt
to
come
to
him
in
moments
of
excitement
is
exactly
what
he
was
my
boy
it
was
that
in
conjunction
with
his
powerful
brain
that
made
him
what
you
called
just
now
dominating
it
gave
him
over
his
he
was
as
literally
without
moral
sense
as
a
man
is
without
a
sense
of
colour
or
a
homicidal
maniac
without
a
sense
of
the
sanctity
of
human
an
expression
of
rather
horrified
and
entirely
uncomprehending
protest
spread
itself
over
face
was
not
mad
he
objected
with
that
incapacity
for
penetrating
beneath
the
surface
which
was
characteristic
of
him
never
even
heard
that
there
was
madness
in
the
would
find
it
if
you
looked
far
enough
without
a
doubt
answered
the
doctor
decidedly
is
a
most
interesting
subject
dennis
and
one
that
very
difficult
to
look
into
without
upsetting
the
whole
theory
of
moral
responsibility
and
doing
more
harm
than
enough
i
say
romayne
was
mad
as
the
word
is
usually
understood
but
all
you
tell
me
confirms
a
notion
i
have
had
about
him
ever
since
this
affair
came
out
he
was
what
we
call
morally
insane
tell
you
what
first
put
the
idea
into
my
head
it
was
the
extraordinary
obtuseness
the
extraordinary
want
of
perception
of
that
blunder
of
his
that
burst
up
the
whole
thing
look
at
it
for
yourself
it
was
a
flaw
in
his
comprehension
of
moral
sense
only
possible
in
a
man
who
knew
of
the
quality
by
hearsay
alone
he
must
have
been
a
very
remarkable
man
i
wish
i
had
known
him
have
heard
the
term
insanity
of
course
said
falconer
slowly
and
distastefully
ignoring
the
last
purely
æsthetic
sentence
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
doctor
if
pardon
my
saying
so
a
very
dangerous
tampering
with
things
that
should
be
sacred
even
from
science
i
can
not
believe
that
any
man
is
actually
incapable
of
knowing
right
from
difficulty
is
said
the
doctor
drily
the
words
right
and
wrong
sometimes
convey
nothing
to
him
as
the
words
red
and
blue
convey
nothing
to
a
man
and
the
endearments
of
his
wife
convey
nothing
to
the
lunatic
who
is
convinced
that
she
is
trying
to
poison
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
abruptly
there
any
children
falconer
glanced
at
him
and
changed
colour
slightly
he
said
slowly
boy
the
keen
shrewd
face
of
the
elder
man
softened
suddenly
and
indescribably
under
one
of
those
quick
sympathetic
impulses
which
were
great
charm
help
his
mother
he
said
gently
falconer
moved
quickly
and
protestingly
and
there
was
a
touch
of
something
like
rebuke
in
his
voice
as
he
said
you
mean
to
say
that
you
think
believe
in
heredity
i
suppose
interrupted
the
doctor
quickly
at
least
you
believe
in
the
heredity
you
deny
that
a
child
may
or
rather
must
inherit
not
only
physical
traits
and
infirmities
but
mental
tendencies
likes
dislikes
aptitudes
incapacities
or
what
not
be
consistent
man
and
acknowledge
the
sequel
though
pleasanter
to
shut
eyes
to
it
i
admit
put
the
theory
of
moral
insanity
out
of
the
question
for
the
moment
if
you
like
say
that
romayne
was
a
pronounced
specimen
of
the
common
criminal
why
should
not
his
child
inherit
his
tendency
to
crime
his
aptitude
for
lying
and
thieving
as
he
might
inherit
his
eyes
or
his
liking
for
music
if
he
had
had
a
turn
that
way
a
religious
man
falconer
i
know
you
believe
i
take
it
that
the
sins
of
the
fathers
shall
be
visited
on
the
children
how
can
they
be
visited
more
heavily
than
in
their
reproduction
you
mark
my
words
my
boy
that
little
child
of
unless
he
inherits
strong
counter
influences
from
his
mother
or
some
ancestor
will
go
the
way
his
father
has
gone
and
may
end
as
his
father
has
ended
there
was
a
slight
sound
by
the
door
behind
the
two
men
as
aston
finished
finished
with
a
force
and
solemnity
that
carried
a
painful
thrill
of
conviction
even
through
the
not
very
penetrable
outer
crust
of
dogma
which
enwrapped
dennis
falconer
and
the
latter
turned
his
head
involuntarily
the
next
instant
both
men
had
sprung
to
their
feet
and
were
standing
dumb
and
aghast
face
to
face
with
romayne
she
was
standing
with
her
hand
still
on
the
lock
of
the
door
as
if
her
attention
had
been
arrested
just
as
she
was
entering
the
room
she
had
apparently
recoiled
for
she
was
pressed
now
tightly
against
the
door
her
face
was
white
to
the
very
lips
and
a
vague
thought
passed
through
falconer
that
he
had
never
seen
it
before
it
was
as
though
the
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
gazed
at
aston
had
changed
it
beyond
recognition
there
was
a
dead
silence
a
moment
during
which
aston
turned
from
red
to
white
and
from
white
to
red
again
and
struggled
vainly
to
find
words
a
moment
during
which
falconer
could
only
stare
blankly
at
that
unfamiliar
face
then
while
the
two
men
were
still
utterly
at
a
loss
romayne
seemed
gradually
to
command
herself
as
if
with
a
tremendous
effort
gradually
as
he
looked
at
her
falconer
saw
the
face
with
which
he
was
familiar
shape
itself
so
to
speak
upon
that
other
face
he
did
not
know
he
saw
her
eyes
change
and
harden
as
if
with
the
effort
necessitated
by
her
conventional
instinct
against
a
scene
he
saw
the
quivering
horror
of
her
mouth
alter
and
subside
in
the
hard
society
smile
he
knew
well
only
rather
stiffer
than
usual
as
her
face
was
whiter
and
then
he
heard
her
speak
with
a
little
movement
of
her
head
in
civil
recognition
of
presence
she
said
to
falconer
book
is
on
that
table
will
you
give
it
to
me
please
her
voice
was
quite
steady
though
thin
almost
mechanically
falconer
handed
her
the
book
she
asked
for
and
with
another
slight
inclination
of
her
head
before
aston
had
recovered
his
balance
sufficiently
to
speak
she
was
gone
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
a
low
ejaculation
broke
from
the
doctor
then
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
slowly
a
remarkable
falconer
drew
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
though
he
were
a
little
dazed
think
not
he
said
stupidly
when
you
know
her
returned
the
doctor
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
him
you
do
know
her
if
falconer
could
have
seen
romayne
an
hour
later
he
would
have
been
more
than
ever
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
his
judgement
the
preparations
for
departure
were
nearly
concluded
she
had
dismissed
her
maid
and
was
finishing
them
herself
with
her
usual
quiet
deliberation
though
her
face
was
very
pale
and
set
but
it
might
have
perplexed
him
somewhat
if
he
had
seen
her
when
everything
was
done
stop
short
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
lift
her
hands
to
her
head
as
though
something
oppressed
her
almost
more
heavily
than
she
could
bear
as
his
father
ended
she
said
below
her
breath
and
disgrace
she
turned
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
her
stood
and
drew
from
it
a
letter
thrust
into
a
pocket
with
several
others
it
was
the
blotted
little
letter
which
began
dear
mamma
and
when
she
returned
it
to
the
bag
at
last
her
face
was
once

the

chapter

there
are
two
diametrically
opposed
points
of
view
from
which
london
life
is
regarded
by
those
who
know
of
it
only
by
hearsay
that
from
which
life
in
the
metropolis
is
contemplated
with
somewhat
awestruck
and
dubious
eyes
as
necessarily
involving
a
continuous
vortex
of
society
and
dissipation
and
that
which
recognises
no
except
during
the
eight
or
ten
weeks
of
high
pressure
known
as
the
season
both
these
points
of
view
are
essentially
false
in
no
place
is
it
possible
to
lead
a
more
completely
life
than
in
london
in
no
place
is
it
possible
to
lead
a
simpler
and
more
life
on
the
other
hand
that
feverish
access
of
stir
and
movement
which
makes
the
months
of
may
and
june
stand
out
and
focus
so
to
speak
the
attention
of
onlookers
is
only
an
acceleration
and
accentuation
of
the
life
which
is
lived
in
certain
strata
of
the
london
world
for
eight
or
nine
months
in
the
year
a
large
proportion
of
the
intellectual
work
of
the
world
is
done
in
london
to
be
in
society
is
a
great
assistance
to
the
intellectual
worker
of
on
his
road
to
material
prosperity
consequently
a
large
section
of
is
of
necessity
in
london
from
october
to
july
and
since
people
must
have
some
occupation
even
out
of
the
season
social
life
in
a
somewhat
lower
key
indeed
than
the
pitch
of
the
season
but
on
the
same
artificial
foundations
goes
on
undisturbed
gathering
about
it
as
any
institution
will
do
a
crowd
of
that
unattached
host
of
idlers
male
and
female
whose
movements
are
dictated
solely
by
their
own
pleasure
or
their
own
weariness
it
was
the
march
of
one
of
the
last
of
the
eighties
a
wild
march
wind
was
taking
the
most
radical
liberties
with
the
aristocratic
neighbourhood
of
grosvenor
place
racing
and
tearing
and
shrieking
down
the
chimneys
with
a
total
absence
of
the
respect
due
to
wealth
if
it
could
have
got
in
at
one
in
particular
of
the
many
windows
at
which
it
rushed
so
vigorously
it
might
have
swept
round
the
room
and
out
again
with
a
whoop
of
amusement
for
the
room
contained
some
twelve
ladies
of
varying
ages
and
demeanours
and
with
perhaps
one
or
two
exceptions
each
lady
was
talking
at
the
top
of
her
speed
which
in
some
cases
was
very
considerable
and
of
her
voice
which
as
a
rule
was
penetrating
every
speaker
was
apparently
addressing
the
same
elderly
and
placid
lady
who
sat
comfortably
back
in
an
and
made
no
attempt
to
listen
to
any
one
perhaps
she
recognised
the
futility
of
such
a
course
the
elderly
and
placid
lady
was
the
mistress
of
the
very
handsomely
and
fashionably
furnished
and
of
the
house
to
which
it
belonged
her
dress
bore
traces
so
near
to
vanishing
point
that
their
actual
presence
had
something
a
little
ludicrous
about
it
of
the
last
lingering
stage
of
mourning
her
name
was
pomeroy
robert
pomeroy
and
she
was
presiding
over
the
committee
for
a
charity
bazaar
fashionable
charities
and
their
frequent
concomitant
the
fashionable
bazaars
which
have
superseded
the
fashionable
private
theatricals
of
some
years
ago
are
generally
and
perhaps
uncharitably
supposed
by
a
certain
class
of
cynical
unfashionables
to
have
their
motive
power
in
a
feminine
love
of
excitement
and
desire
for
conspicuousness
perhaps
there
is
another
aspect
under
which
they
may
present
themselves
namely
as
a
proof
that
not
even
a
long
course
of
society
life
can
destroy
the
instinct
for
work
even
though
the
circumstances
under
which
it
struggles
may
render
it
so
mere
a
travesty
of
the
real
thing
from
this
point
of
view
and
when
the
promoter
of
a
charitable
folly
is
a
woman
who
puts
into
the
business
an
almost
painfully
earnest
enthusiasm
which
might
have
been
so
useful
if
she
had
only
known
more
of
any
life
outside
her
own
narrow
round
the
situation
is
not
without
its
pathos
but
when
as
in
the
present
instance
a
and
venerable
philanthropic
institution
is
suddenly
taken
up
and
patronised
by
such
a
woman
as
the
secretary
and
treasurer
of
the
present
committee
a
woman
who
would
have
been
and
vociferous
in
any
sphere
and
who
had
been
moulded
by
circumstances
into
a
pronounced
specimen
of
a
certain
type
of
fashionable
woman
dashing
loud
essentially
unsympathetic
the
position
in
the
incongruities
and
discrepancies
involved
becomes
wholly
humorous
ralph
halse
in
virtue
of
her
office
as
secretary
and
treasurer
was
sitting
at
right
hand
her
conception
as
to
the
duties
of
her
office
seemed
to
be
limited
to
a
sense
that
it
behoved
her
never
for
a
single
instant
to
leave
off
addressing
the
chair
and
this
duty
she
fulfilled
with
a
conscientious
energy
worthy
of
the
highest
praise
she
had
the
and
institution
before
alluded
to
about
a
month
earlier
a
capital
time
of
year
you
know
when
one
has
nothing
to
do
and
can
attend
to
things
thoroughly
she
had
explained
to
her
friends
she
had
determined
that
must
be
done
as
she
had
rather
vaguely
phrased
it
and
she
had
applied
herself
exuberantly
and
forthwith
to
the
organisation
of
a
bazaar
the
season
was
lent
philanthropy
was
the
fashion
scheme
became
the
pet
hobby
of
the
moment
and
the
committee
was
selected
exclusively
from
among
women
well
known
in
society
the
committee
was
tremendously
in
earnest
nobody
could
listen
to
it
and
doubt
that
fact
for
a
moment
at
the
same
time
a
listener
would
have
found
some
difficulty
in
determining
what
was
the
particular
point
which
had
evoked
such
enthusiasm
because
as
has
been
said
the
members
were
all
talking
at
once
their
eloquence
was
checked
at
last
not
as
might
have
been
the
case
with
a
male
committee
by
a
few
short
and
pithy
words
from
the
gently
smiling
president
but
by
the
appearance
of
five
tea
the
torrent
of
declamatory
enthusiasm
thereupon
subsided
quenched
in
the
individual
consciousness
that
took
possession
of
each
lady
that
she
was
for
her
tea
and
had
been
working
like
a
the
committee
broke
up
with
charming
informality
into
duets
and
trios
even
ralph
halse
ceased
to
address
the
chair
though
she
could
not
cease
to
express
her
views
on
the
vital
point
which
had
roused
the
committee
to
a
state
bordering
on
frenzy
she
turned
to
her
nearest
neighbour
halse
was
a
tall
woman
in
a
highly
coloured
style
and
appearing
younger
than
her
years
she
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
grey
and
the
delicate
sobriety
of
her
attire
was
oddly
out
of
keeping
with
her
florid
personality
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
hobby
which
had
preceded
the
present
idea
of
the
bazaar
in
her
mind
halse
was
a
woman
of
hobbies
had
been
ritualism
of
an
advanced
type
perhaps
some
of
the
fervour
with
which
her
latest
interest
had
been
embraced
was
due
to
a
certain
sense
of
flatness
in
its
predecessor
but
be
that
as
it
may
her
present
very
fashionable
attire
represented
her
idea
of
lenten
mourning
see
myself
how
there
can
be
two
opinions
on
the
subject
she
said
ralph
halse
very
seldom
did
see
how
there
could
be
two
opinions
on
a
subject
on
which
her
own
views
were
decided
dress
is
a
distinct
feature
and
of
course
there
must
be
more
effect
and
more
variety
when
each
woman
is
dressed
as
suits
her
best
than
when
there
is
any
attempt
at
uniform
you
agree
with
me
lady
bracondale
sure
the
woman
she
addressed
was
of
the
pronounced
elderly
aristocratic
type
tall
and
thin
and
sallow
of
complexion
she
seemed
to
be
altogether
superior
to
enthusiasm
of
any
kind
and
her
manner
was
of
that
unreal
kind
of
dignity
and
chilling
suavity
in
which
nothing
is
genuine
but
its
slight
touch
of
condescension
dress
is
a
pretty
sight
she
said
it
is
perhaps
a
drawback
that
of
course
all
the
can
not
be
expected
to
wear
the
words
were
spoken
with
an
emphasis
which
plainly
conveyed
the
sense
that
no
such
abrogation
of
dignity
could
by
any
possibility
be
expected
of
herself
is
your
opinion
pomeroy
lady
bracondale
added
turning
to
the
chairwoman
of
the
committee
attention
was
not
claimed
for
the
moment
otherwise
than
by
her
serene
enjoyment
of
her
cup
of
tea
which
she
was
sipping
with
the
air
of
a
woman
who
has
done
and
is
conscious
of
having
done
a
hard
work
perhaps
it
is
somewhat
fatiguing
to
be
talked
to
by
twelve
ladies
all
at
once
lady
question
was
one
which
pomeroy
rarely
answered
however
even
in
her
secret
heart
so
she
only
smiled
now
and
shook
her
head
thoughtfully
fancy
dress
gives
so
much
scope
for
individual
taste
you
think
said
halse
course
it
does
my
dear
halse
every
one
can
wear
what
they
like
and
that
is
very
nice
answered
pomeroy
comfortably
on
the
other
hand
a
quiet
uniform
can
be
worn
by
any
one
said
lady
bracondale
with
explanatory
condescension
any
one
of
course
so
important
assented
the
chairwoman
with
bland
cheerfulness
then
as
lips
parted
to
give
vent
to
a
flood
of
eloquence
she
continued
placidly
in
her
gentle
contented
voice
romayne
is
not
here
yet
i
wonder
what
she
will
say
met
her
at
the
french
embassy
last
night
said
halse
with
a
slightly
aggressive
inflection
in
her
voice
she
told
me
she
meant
to
come
if
she
could
make
time
apparently
she
has
not
been
able
to
romayne
repeated
lady
bracondale
interrogatively
think
met
her
really
one
feels
quite
out
of
the
there
was
a
fine
affectation
of
sincerity
about
the
words
which
would
however
hardly
have
deceived
the
most
unsophisticated
hearer
as
to
the
position
in
society
or
her
own
appreciation
of
it
lady
bracondale
was
distinctly
a
person
to
be
known
by
anybody
wishing
to
make
good
a
claim
to
be
considered
in
society
and
she
was
loftily
conscious
of
the
fact
she
had
only
just
returned
to
town
from
bracondale
where
she
had
been
spending
the
last
two
months
she
repeated
romayne
ah
yes
to
be
sure
the
name
is
familiar
to
me
i
thought
it
was
there
was
a
little
woman
years
ago
whom
we
met
on
the
continent
her
husband
dear
me
now
what
was
it
ah
yes
her
husband
failed
or
no
of
course
i
recollect
he
was
a
swindler
of
some
sort
of
course
one
never
met
her
again
romayne
is
the
same
ralph
says
said
halse
sipping
her
tea
least
her
husband
was
william
romayne
who
was
the
moving
spirit
in
a
big
bank
swindle
and
a
lot
of
other
things
i
believe
years
ago
she
turned
up
about
two
months
ago
and
took
a
house
in
chelsea
lots
of
money
apparently
she
has
a
son
he
would
be
of
course
who
is
going
to
the
dear
me
said
lady
bracondale
with
freezing
stateliness
she
propose
to
go
into
society
it
was
a
most
scandalous
affair
my
dear
pomeroy
as
far
as
i
remember
a
connection
of
lord
lost
some
money
i
recollect
and
i
think
the
man
romayne
i
mean
of
course
poisoned
himself
or
something
we
were
at
nice
when
it
happened
he
committed
suicide
there
and
it
was
most
unpleasant
she
expect
one
to
know
her
eighteen
years
had
passed
since
the
same
woman
had
expressed
herself
as
eager
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
man
and
the
haze
which
had
wrapped
itself
in
her
mind
about
the
tragedy
which
had
frustrated
her
desire
in
that
direction
was
not
the
only
outcome
for
her
of
the
passing
of
those
years
lady
bracondale
had
been
lady
cloughton
eighteen
years
ago
the
wife
of
the
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
bracondale
poor
and
with
a
somewhat
perfunctorily
yielded
position
she
and
her
husband
had
been
moreover
a
cheery
pair
living
chiefly
on
the
continent
and
getting
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
out
of
life
his
death
had
given
to
lord
cloughton
the
family
title
and
the
family
lands
and
with
his
accession
to
wealth
importance
and
responsibilities
his
whole
personality
had
gradually
seemed
to
become
transformed
her
satisfaction
in
her
new
dignities
took
the
form
of
living
rigidly
up
to
what
she
considered
their
obligations
laxity
frivolity
of
any
kind
seemed
to
her
to
abrogate
from
the
importance
of
her
position
she
ranged
herself
on
the
side
of
strict
decorum
and
respectability
and
became
more
precise
than
the
precisians
her
husband
at
the
same
time
developed
talents
latent
in
his
obscurity
and
became
a
prominent
politician
and
the
and
exclusive
lady
bracondale
was
now
in
truth
a
power
in
society
consequently
the
tone
in
which
she
disposed
of
the
intruder
who
had
ventured
unauthorised
to
obtain
recognition
during
her
absence
was
crushing
and
conclusive
but
individuality
was
of
too
soft
a
consistency
to
allow
of
her
being
crushed
and
she
replied
placidly
and
with
unconscious
practicality
do
know
her
dear
lady
bracondale
she
said
had
some
friends
among
really
nice
people
to
begin
with
and
every
one
has
called
on
her
i
really
know
how
it
has
happened
but
it
is
years
and
years
ago
you
know
and
she
really
is
a
delightful
little
woman
quite
wrapped
up
in
her
boy
almost
before
the
words
were
well
uttered
before
lady
bracondale
could
translate
into
speech
the
aristocratic
disapproval
written
stiffly
on
her
face
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
footman
announced
romayne
chapter
vii
eighteen
years
lay
between
the
events
which
lady
bracondale
recalled
so
hazily
and
the
romayne
who
crossed
the
threshold
of
as
the
footman
spoke
her
name
those
eighteen
years
had
changed
her
at
once
curiously
more
and
curiously
less
than
the
years
between
and
usually
change
a
woman
she
looked
at
the
first
glance
very
little
older
than
she
had
done
eighteen
years
ago
younger
indeed
than
she
had
looked
during
those
early
days
of
her
widowhood
such
changes
as
time
had
made
in
her
appearance
seemed
mainly
due
to
the
immense
difference
in
the
styles
of
dress
now
obtaining
the
dainty
colouring
the
cut
of
her
frock
the
pose
of
her
bonnet
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
with
its
fluffy
curls
all
seemed
to
accentuate
her
prettiness
and
to
bring
out
the
youthfulness
which
a
little
woman
without
strongly
marked
features
may
keep
for
so
long
the
fluffy
hair
was
a
now
instead
of
a
pale
yellow
and
the
change
was
becoming
although
it
helped
greatly
though
very
subtly
to
alter
the
character
of
her
face
the
outline
of
her
features
was
perhaps
a
trifle
sharper
than
it
had
been
and
there
were
sundry
lines
about
the
mouth
and
eyes
when
it
was
in
repose
but
these
were
obliterated
as
a
rule
by
a
characteristic
to
which
all
the
minor
changes
in
her
seemed
to
have
more
or
less
direct
reference
a
characteristic
which
seemed
to
make
the
very
similarity
between
the
woman
of
and
the
woman
of
eighteen
years
before
seem
unreal
the
singular
brightness
and
vivacity
of
her
expression
her
features
were
animated
eager
almost
restless
her
gestures
and
movements
were
alert
and
quick
her
voice
as
she
spoke
to
an
acquaintance
here
and
there
as
she
moved
up
was
brisk
and
laughing
her
dress
and
demeanour
were
the
dress
and
demeanour
of
the
day
to
the
subtlest
shade
she
had
been
a
typical
woman
of
the
world
eighteen
years
before
she
was
a
typical
woman
of
the
world
now
but
in
the
old
days
the
personality
of
the
woman
had
been
dominated
by
and
merged
in
the
type
now
the
type
seemed
to
be
penetrated
by
something
from
within
which
was
not
to
be
wholly
suppressed
she
came
quickly
down
the
long
smiling
and
nodding
as
she
came
and
greeted
pomeroy
with
a
little
exaggerated
gesture
of
despair
and
apology
you
really
finished
she
cried
everything
settled
how
shocking
of
me
then
as
she
shook
hands
with
halse
she
added
with
a
sweetness
of
tone
which
seemed
to
cover
an
underlying
tendency
which
was
not
sweet
we
have
such
a
host
in
our
secretary
that
really
one
voice
more
or
less
makes
very
little
really
i
know
that
we
have
settled
anything
said
pomeroy
have
talked
things
over
you
know
it
is
such
a
mistake
to
be
in
a
hurry
you
think
so
not
a
doubt
of
it
was
the
answer
given
with
a
laugh
dear
pomeroy
i
have
been
in
a
hurry
for
the
last
six
weeks
and
a
frightful
state
of
things
had
a
capital
meeting
though
why
i
believe
i
am
actually
the
only
defaulter
the
hard
blue
eyes
were
moving
rapidly
over
the
room
as
romayne
spoke
there
was
an
eager
comprehensive
glance
in
them
as
though
the
survey
taken
was
in
some
sense
a
survey
of
material
or
at
one
instant
of
a
and
it
gave
a
certain
unreality
to
their
carelessness
only
defaulter
yes
agreed
pomeroy
comfortably
now
romayne
you
must
let
me
introduce
you
to
a
new
member
of
our
committee
quite
an
acquisition
why
where
oh
and
serenely
oblivious
of
the
stony
stare
with
which
lady
bracondale
a
few
paces
off
was
regarding
the
opposite
wall
of
the
room
just
over
the
bonnet
pomeroy
with
her
kind
fat
hand
on
arm
approached
the
exclusive
acquisition
me
introduce
romayne
dear
lady
bracondale
she
said
with
unimpaired
placidity
the
stony
stare
was
lowered
an
inch
or
two
until
it
was
about
on
a
level
with
eyebrows
and
lady
bracondale
bowed
icily
but
at
the
same
moment
romayne
held
out
her
hand
with
a
graceful
little
exclamation
of
surprise
it
was
not
genuine
though
it
sounded
so
those
keen
quick
blue
eyes
had
seen
lady
bracondale
and
recognised
her
in
the
course
of
their
progress
up
the
room
and
had
observed
her
withdrawal
of
herself
those
two
or
three
paces
from
vicinity
and
it
was
as
they
rested
for
an
instant
only
on
her
in
their
subsequent
survey
of
the
room
that
that
subtle
change
suggestive
of
a
sense
of
coming
battle
had
come
to
them
they
looked
full
into
lady
face
now
with
a
smiling
ease
which
was
just
touched
with
a
suggestion
of
pleasure
in
the
meeting
hardly
know
whether
we
require
an
introduction
said
romayne
she
spoke
with
cordiality
which
was
just
sufficiently
careless
to
be
thoroughly
is
so
many
years
since
we
met
though
that
perhaps
our
former
acquaintanceship
must
be
considered
to
have
died
a
natural
death
i
am
very
pleased
that
it
should
have
a
resurrection
she
finished
with
a
little
light
laugh
and
lady
bracondale
found
almost
to
her
own
surprise
that
they
were
shaking
hands
if
she
had
been
able
to
analyse
cause
and
effect
which
she
was
not
she
would
have
known
that
it
was
that
carelessness
in
manner
that
influenced
her
a
powerful
prompter
to
a
freezing
demeanour
is
withdrawn
when
the
other
party
is
obviously
insensible
to
cold
is
really
too
bad
of
me
to
be
so
late
continued
romayne
proceeding
to
pass
over
their
past
acquaintance
as
a
half
forgotten
recollection
to
which
they
were
both
indifferent
and
taking
up
matters
as
they
stood
with
the
easy
unconcern
and
casual
conversationalism
of
a
society
woman
least
it
would
be
if
my
time
were
my
own
just
now
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
sole
for
the
moment
is
the
getting
ready
of
our
little
place
for
my
boy
i
ought
to
have
shut
myself
up
with
carpenters
and
upholsterers
until
it
was
done
i
assure
you
i
even
dine
out
without
a
guilty
feeling
that
i
ought
to
be
seeing
after
something
or
other
connected
with
chairs
and
tables
she
finished
with
a
laugh
about
which
there
was
a
touch
of
artificiality
as
there
had
been
about
her
tone
as
she
alluded
to
her
perhaps
the
only
thoroughly
genuine
point
about
her
at
that
moment
was
a
certain
intent
watchfulness
strongly
repressed
in
the
eyes
with
which
she
met
lady
stare
and
something
about
the
spirited
pose
of
her
head
and
the
lines
of
her
face
always
recalling
vaguely
and
indefinitely
that
idea
of
single
combat
lady
bracondale
however
was
not
a
judge
of
artificiality
and
manner
with
its
perfect
assurance
and
careless
assumption
of
a
position
and
a
footing
in
society
affected
her
in
spite
of
herself
the
stony
stare
relaxed
perceptibly
as
she
said
stiffly
enough
but
with
condescending
interest
are
expecting
your
son
in
town
am
expecting
him
every
day
i
am
delighted
to
say
answered
romayne
with
a
little
conventional
gush
of
superficial
enthusiasm
you
have
no
idea
how
forlorn
i
am
without
him
we
are
quite
absurdly
devoted
to
one
another
as
i
often
tell
him
stupid
fellow
but
i
always
think
you
that
a
man
is
much
better
out
of
the
way
during
the
agonies
of
furnishing
so
i
insisted
on
his
making
a
little
tour
while
i
plunged
into
the
fray
he
was
very
anxious
to
help
of
course
dear
fellow
but
i
told
him
frankly
that
he
would
be
more
hindrance
than
help
and
packed
him
off
and
made
a
great
baby
of
myself
when
he
was
gone
of
course
i
have
had
to
console
myself
by
making
our
little
place
as
perfect
as
possible
as
a
surprise
for
him
you
know
how
these
things
grow
one
little
surprise
after
another
comes
into
head
and
one
excuses
oneself
for
extravagance
when
for
you
thinking
of
settling
in
london
enquired
lady
bracondale
she
was
unbending
moment
by
moment
in
direct
contradiction
of
her
preconceived
determination
romayne
was
so
bright
and
so
unconscious
she
ran
off
her
pretty
maternal
platitudes
with
such
careless
confidence
that
iciness
on
lady
part
would
have
assumed
a
futile
and
even
ridiculous
appearance
was
the
answer
are
going
to
settle
down
a
regular
cosy
couple
it
has
been
our
castle
in
the
air
all
the
time
his
education
has
been
going
on
he
is
to
read
for
the
bar
and
i
tell
him
that
he
will
value
a
holiday
more
in
another
year
or
two
poor
fellow
but
afraid
i
bore
about
him
frightfully
she
added
with
another
laugh
it
is
rather
hard
on
him
poor
boy
for
he
really
is
not
a
bore
i
think
you
will
like
him
lady
bracondale
i
remember
young
men
always
adored
you
lady
bracondale
smiled
absolutely
smiled
and
said
graciously
graciously
for
her
that
is
to
say
must
bring
him
to
see
me
i
should
like
to
call
upon
you
if
you
will
give
me
your
romayne
was
in
the
act
of
complying
complying
with
smiling
indifference
which
was
the
very
perfection
of
society
manner
when
pomeroy
evidently
moved
solely
by
the
impetus
of
the
excited
group
of
ladies
of
which
she
was
the
serenely
smiling
centre
bore
cheerfully
down
upon
them
we
ought
to
vote
about
the
fancy
dress
before
we
separate
this
afternoon
she
suggested
shall
we
talk
it
over
a
little
more
at
the
next
meeting
perhaps
that
would
be
wiser
romayne
she
looked
invitingly
at
romayne
as
if
for
her
opinion
on
the
subject
and
the
invitation
was
responded
to
with
that
little
laugh
let
us
put
it
off
until
the
next
meeting
she
said
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
really
must
run
away
now
but
at
the
next
meeting
i
promise
faithfully
to
be
here
at
the
beginning
and
stay
until
the
very
whereupon
it
became
evident
that
the
greater
part
of
the
committee
was
anxious
to
postpone
the
decision
on
the
knotty
point
in
question
and
was
conscious
of
more
or
less
pressing
engagements
a
general
exodus
ensued
halse
alone
remaining
to
expound
her
views
to
pomeroy
all
by
herself
and
in
a
higher
and
more
conclusive
tone
than
before
a
neat
little
coupé
was
waiting
for
romayne
she
gave
the
coachman
the
order
at
first
and
then
paused
and
told
him
to
go
to
a
famous
cigar
she
got
into
the
carriage
with
a
smiling
gesture
of
farewell
to
lady
bracondale
whose
brougham
passed
her
at
the
moment
but
as
she
leant
back
against
the
cushions
the
smile
died
from
her
lips
with
singular
suddenness
it
left
her
face
very
intent
the
eyes
very
bright
and
hard
the
lips
set
and
a
little
compressed
the
lines
about
them
and
about
her
eyes
showed
out
faintly
under
this
new
aspect
of
her
face
in
spite
of
the
eager
satisfaction
which
was
its
dominant
expression
the
battle
had
evidently
been
fought
and
won
and
the
victor
was
ready
and
braced
for
the
next
she
got
out
at
the
cigar
and
when
she
returned
to
her
carriage
there
was
that
expression
of
elation
about
her
which
often
attends
the
perpetration
of
a
piece
of
extravagance
but
as
she
was
driven
through
the
fading
sunlight
of
the
march
afternoon
towards
chelsea
her
face
settled
once
more
into
that
intent
reflection
and
satisfaction
it
was
a
narrow
slip
of
a
house
at
which
her
coupé
eventually
stopped
wedged
in
among
much
more
mansions
in
the
most
fashionable
part
of
chelsea
but
what
it
lacked
in
size
it
made
up
in
brightness
and
general
smartness
it
had
evidently
been
recently
done
up
with
all
the
latest
improvements
in
paint
and
fittings
generally
and
it
presented
a
very
attractive
appearance
indeed
romayne
let
herself
in
with
a
and
went
quickly
across
the
prettily
decorated
hall
into
a
room
at
the
back
of
what
was
evidently
the
she
opened
the
door
and
then
stood
still
upon
the
threshold
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
was
stealing
in
at
the
window
the
lower
half
of
which
was
filled
in
with
indian
blinds
and
as
it
fell
in
long
slanting
rays
across
the
silent
room
it
seemed
to
emphasize
and
at
the
same
time
to
soften
and
beautify
an
impression
of
waiting
and
of
expectancy
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
everything
that
room
contained
it
was
furnished
it
was
not
large
as
a
compromise
between
a
and
a
study
and
its
every
item
from
the
bookcases
and
the
to
the
bronzes
on
the
mantelpiece
was
in
the
most
approved
and
latest
style
and
of
the
very
best
kind
every
conceivable
detail
had
evidently
been
thought
out
and
attended
to
the
room
was
obviously
absolutely
complete
and
perfect
only
on
the
something
seemed
lacking
and
some
brown
paper
parcels
lay
there
waiting
to
be
unfastened
and
it
had
as
obviously
never
been
lived
in
it
was
like
a
body
without
a
soul
the
lingering
light
stole
along
the
wall
touching
here
and
there
those
unused
objects
waiting
characterless
for
that
strange
character
which
the
personality
of
a
man
impresses
always
on
the
room
in
which
he
lives
and
its
last
touch
fell
upon
the
face
of
the
woman
standing
in
the
doorway
the
artificiality
of
its
expression
was
standing
out
in
strong
relief
as
if
in
half
conscious
half
instinctive
struggle
with
something
that
lay
behind
something
which
the
aspect
of
that
empty
room
had
developed
out
of
its
previous
intentness
and
excitement
with
a
little
affected
laugh
as
though
some
one
else
had
been
present
or
as
though
affectation
were
indeed
second
nature
to
her
romayne
went
up
to
the
and
began
to
undo
the
parcels
lying
there
they
contained
a
very
handsome
set
of
fittings
for
a
and
she
arranged
them
in
their
places
clearing
away
the
paper
with
scrupulous
care
and
with
another
little
laugh
a
ridiculous
woman
she
said
half
aloud
with
just
the
intonation
she
had
used
in
speaking
to
lady
bracondale
of
her
for
what
a
spoilt
fellow
she
turned
away
went
out
of
the
room
with
one
backward
glance
as
she
closed
the
door
and
upstairs
to
the
she
had
just
entered
the
room
when
a
thought
seemed
to
strike
her
utterly
ridiculous
she
said
to
herself
quite
forgot
to
notice
whether
there
were
any
letters
she
was
just
crossing
the
room
to
ring
for
a
servant
when
the
bell
rang
vigorously
and
she
stopped
short
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
she
went
to
the
door
and
stood
there
listening
that
she
might
prepare
herself
beforehand
for
the
possible
visitor
for
whom
she
evidently
had
no
desire
tiresome
she
said
to
herself
is
it
i
wonder
she
heard
the
parlourmaid
go
down
the
hall
and
open
the
door
romayne
at
home
with
a
shock
and
convulsion
which
only
the
wildest
leap
of
the
heart
can
produce
the
listening
face
in
the
doorway
with
the
conventional
smile
which
might
momently
be
called
for
just
quivering
on
it
half
in
abeyance
half
in
evidence
was
suddenly
transformed
every
trace
of
artificiality
fell
away
blotted
out
utterly
before
the
swift
involuntary
flash
of
mother
love
and
longing
with
which
those
hard
blue
eyes
those
pretty
superficial
little
features
were
in
that
instant
transfigured
the
elaborately
dressed
figure
caught
at
the
as
any
homely
drudge
might
have
done
the
woman
of
the
world
startled
out
of
or
into
herself
forgot
the
world
julian
the
white
trembling
lips
murmured
as
she
spoke
the
word
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
there
dashed
a
tall
young
man
who
caught
her
in
his
arms
with
a
delighted
laugh
her
own
laugh
but
with
a
boyish
ring
of
sincerity
in
it
taken

mother

my
telegram
chapter
viii
romayne
had
been
left
eighteen
years
before
absolutely
penniless
when
dennis
falconer
took
her
back
from
nice
to
her
home
in
london
she
had
returned
to
that
house
wholly
dependent
for
herself
and
for
her
little
boy
on
the
generosity
she
would
meet
with
there
fortunately
old
falconer
was
a
rich
man
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
money
in
the
falconer
family
and
as
its
representatives
decreased
in
number
that
money
had
collected
itself
in
the
hands
of
a
few
survivors
a
long
nervous
illness
slight
enough
in
itself
but
begetting
considerable
restlessness
and
irritability
had
followed
on
her
return
to
london
so
natural
her
cousin
and
uncle
had
said
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
such
an
illness
was
anything
but
natural
in
such
a
woman
as
romayne
and
anything
but
consistent
with
her
demeanour
during
the
early
days
of
her
widowhood
partly
by
the
advice
of
the
doctor
partly
by
reason
of
the
sense
unexpressed
but
shared
by
all
concerned
that
london
was
by
no
means
a
desirable
residence
for
the
widow
of
william
romayne
old
falconer
and
his
daughter
left
their
quiet
london
home
and
went
abroad
with
her
no
definite
period
was
talked
of
for
their
return
to
england
and
they
settled
down
in
a
charming
little
house
near
the
lake
of
geneva
in
the
same
house
when
julian
was
seven
years
old
frances
falconer
died
her
death
was
comparatively
sudden
and
the
blow
broke
her
heart
from
that
time
forward
his
only
close
interests
in
life
were
romayne
and
her
boy
the
vague
expectation
of
a
return
to
london
at
some
future
time
faded
out
altogether
only
desire
was
to
please
his
niece
and
she
with
the
same
tendency
towards
seclusion
which
had
dictated
their
first
choice
of
a
continental
home
suggested
a
place
near
heidelberg
here
they
lived
for
five
years
more
and
then
falconer
also
died
leaving
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
romayne
the
remainder
was
to
go
to
dennis
falconer
to
his
only
other
near
relation
william
little
son
he
left
no
money
so
seven
years
after
her
death
romayne
was
a
rich
woman
again
rich
and
independent
as
she
had
never
been
before
and
practically
alone
in
the
world
with
her
son
in
her
relations
with
her
son
those
seven
years
had
brought
about
a
curious
alteration
or
developement
the
dawnings
of
this
change
had
been
observed
by
frances
falconer
during
the
early
months
of
widowhood
she
had
spoken
to
her
father
with
tears
in
her
eyes
of
her
belief
that
her
cousin
was
turning
for
consolation
to
her
child
blindly
attached
to
her
cousin
she
had
never
acknowledged
her
previous
easy
indifference
as
a
mother
she
stood
by
while
the
first
place
in
little
easy
affections
was
gradually
won
away
from
herself
not
only
without
a
thought
of
resentment
but
without
any
capacity
for
the
criticism
of
demeanour
in
her
new
capacity
as
a
devoted
mother
to
her
that
devotion
was
the
natural
and
beautiful
outcome
of
the
overthrow
of
her
married
life
to
sundry
other
people
the
new
departure
presented
other
aspects
dennis
falconer
spending
a
few
days
at
the
house
near
the
lake
of
geneva
regarded
with
eyes
of
stern
distaste
what
seemed
to
him
the
most
affected
superficial
travesty
of
the
maternal
sentiment
ever
exhibited
meditating
upon
the
subject
by
himself
he
referred
assumption
of
the
character
of
devoted
mother
to
the
innate
artificiality
of
a
fashionable
woman
denied
the
legitimate
outlet
of
society
life
he
went
away
marvelling
at
the
blindness
of
his
uncle
and
cousin
and
asking
himself
with
heavy
disapprobation
how
long
the
pose
would
last
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
seemed
only
to
confirm
it
the
wholly
artificial
manner
with
which
romayne
had
alluded
to
her
in
was
the
same
manner
with
which
in
his
early
she
had
alluded
to
her
boy
only
developed
by
years
death
and
her
own
consequent
independence
had
made
no
difference
in
her
way
of
life
education
had
been
proceeded
with
on
the
continent
as
had
been
already
arranged
his
mother
living
always
near
at
hand
that
they
might
be
together
whenever
it
was
possible
in
his
holidays
they
took
little
luxurious
tours
together
but
into
society
romayne
went
not
at
all
until
julian
was
over
twenty
when
the
haze
of
fifteen
years
had
wound
itself
about
the
memory
of
william
romayne
and
his
misdeeds
of
those
misdeeds
william
son
knew
nothing
the
one
point
of
discord
between
old
falconer
and
his
niece
had
been
her
alleged
intention
of
keeping
the
truth
from
him
if
possible
for
ever
death
removed
the
only
creature
who
had
a
right
to
protest
against
her
decision
when
julian
as
he
grew
older
asked
his
first
questions
about
his
father
she
told
him
that
he
had
and
had
died
suddenly
and
begged
him
not
to
question
her
and
the
boy
careless
and
had
taken
her
at
her
word
with
the
termination
of
university
career
it
became
necessary
that
some
arrangement
should
be
made
for
his
future
as
julian
grew
up
the
topic
had
come
up
between
the
mother
and
son
with
increasing
frequency
introduced
as
a
rule
not
as
might
have
been
expected
by
the
young
man
whom
it
most
concerned
but
by
romayne
from
the
very
first
it
had
been
presented
to
him
as
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
start
in
life
to
which
he
was
to
look
forward
was
to
be
made
in
london
london
was
to
be
their
home
and
he
was
to
read
for
the
english
bar
on
these
premises
all
plans
and
suggestions
were
grounded
and
was
not
the
nature
to
carve
out
the
idea
of
a
future
for
himself
in
opposition
to
that
presented
to
him
consequently
the
arrangements
of
which
the
bright
little
house
in
chelsea
was
the
preliminary
outcome
were
matured
with
much
gaiety
and
enthusiasm
in
what
romayne
called
merrily
family
council
of
and
a
certain
touch
of
feverish
excitement
which
had
pervaded
his
consideration
of
the
subject
moved
julian
to
a
carelessly
affectionate
compunction
in
that
it
was
presumably
for
his
sake
that
she
had
remained
so
long
away
from
the
life
she
apparently
preferred
the
arrangement
by
which
romayne
eventually
came
to
london
alone
was
not
part
of
the
original
scheme
as
the
time
fixed
for
their
departure
thither
drew
nearer
that
feverish
excitement
increased
upon
her
strangely
it
seemed
as
an
expression
of
the
nervous
restlessness
that
possessed
her
that
she
finally
insisted
on
his
joining
some
friends
who
were
going
for
two
months
to
egypt
and
leaving
her
to
with
the
agonies
of
furnishing
as
she
said
alone
the
arrangement
had
separated
the
mother
and
son
for
the
first
time
within
memory
the
fact
had
perhaps
had
little
practical
influence
on
his
enjoyment
in
the
interval
but
it
gave
an
added
fervour
to
his
boyish
demonstration
of
delight
in
that
first
moment
of
meeting
as
he
held
her
in
his
vigorous
young
arms
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
think
of
my
having
surprised
you
after
all
he
cried
gleefully
at
last
ought
to
have
had
my
telegram
this
morning
why
got
nervous
while
been
alone
mother
quite
trembling
romayne
laughed
a
rather
uncertain
little
laugh
she
was
indeed
trembling
from
head
to
foot
her
face
was
very
pale
still
but
as
she
raised
it
to
her
son
the
strange
transfigured
look
had
passed
from
it
utterly
and
her
normal
expression
had
returned
to
it
in
all
its
superficial
liveliness
brought
back
by
an
effort
of
will
conscious
or
instinctive
which
was
perceptible
in
the
slight
stiffness
of
all
the
lines
at
the
same
moment
she
seemed
to
become
aware
of
the
close
clinging
pressure
with
which
her
hand
had
closed
upon
the
arm
which
held
her
and
she
relaxed
it
in
a
gesture
of
playful
rebuke
and
deprecation
would
you
have
bad
boy
she
said
lightly
you
know
i
hate
surprises
oh
i
suppose
you
want
to
flatter
yourself
that
your
poor
little
mother
get
on
without
you
to
take
care
of
her
well
perhaps
she
very
well
a
demoralising
confession
for
you
sir
but
it
was
not
such
a
confession
as
her
face
had
been
only
a
few
minutes
before
in
fact
the
spoken
words
seemed
rather
to
belie
that
mute
witness
they
were
spoken
in
her
ordinary
tone
and
the
gesture
with
which
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
to
draw
him
into
the
was
one
of
her
usual
pretty
affected
gestures
as
sharp
a
contrast
as
possible
to
the
first
clinging
unconscious
touch
me
look
at
you
she
said
gaily
make
sure
that
i
have
got
my
own
bad
penny
back
from
africa
and
not
somebody
she
drew
him
laughingly
into
the
fullest
light
the
fading
day
afforded
and
proceeded
to
him
as
she
said
her
face
full
of
a
superficial
vivacity
which
seemed
to
be
doing
battle
all
the
time
with
something
behind
something
which
looked
out
of
her
hard
bright
eyes
eager
and
insistent
julian
romayne
was
a
tall
young
man
taller
by
a
head
than
the
mother
smiling
up
at
him
he
was
well
developed
for
his
years
slight
and
and
carrying
himself
more
gracefully
than
most
young
englishmen
but
except
in
this
particular
and
in
a
slight
tendency
towards
the
use
of
more
gesture
than
is
common
in
england
his
foreign
training
was
in
no
wise
perceptible
in
his
appearance
the
first
impression
he
made
on
people
who
knew
them
both
was
that
he
was
exactly
like
his
mother
and
that
his
features
touched
into
manliness
were
a
very
desirable
inheritance
for
her
son
for
he
was
distinctly
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
the
upper
part
of
his
face
and
his
colouring
were
he
had
the
fair
hair
which
had
been
hers
eighteen
years
ago
he
had
her
blue
eyes
and
her
pale
complexion
and
his
nose
and
the
shape
of
his
brow
were
hers
but
his
mouth
was
larger
and
rather
than
his
and
the
line
of
the
chin
and
jaw
was
totally
different
no
characteristics
either
intellectual
or
moral
were
to
be
read
in
his
face
his
expression
was
simply
bright
and
with
the
good
temper
which
has
never
been
tried
and
is
the
result
rather
of
circumstances
than
of
principle
that
strange
something
in
face
seemed
to
retreat
into
the
depths
from
which
it
had
come
as
she
looked
at
him
she
finished
her
inspection
with
a
gay
tirade
against
the
coat
which
he
was
wearing
and
julian
replied
with
a
boyish
laugh
knew
be
down
upon
it
he
said
say
does
it
look
so
very
bad
get
a
new
fit
out
two
or
three
in
fact
mother
what
an
awfully
pretty
little
what
an
awfully
clever
little
mother
you
are
he
flung
his
arm
round
her
again
with
the
careless
affectionate
demonstrativeness
which
her
manner
seemed
to
produce
in
him
and
looked
round
the
room
with
admiring
eyes
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
young
man
who
knew
better
than
some
men
twice
his
age
how
a
room
should
look
and
whose
appreciation
was
better
worth
having
than
it
seemed
quite
ready
for
me
you
see
he
declared
delightedly
did
you
mean
i
should
like
to
know
by
wanting
to
keep
me
away
for
another
fortnight
there
was
a
pause
before
romayne
spoke
she
looked
up
into
his
face
with
a
rather
strange
expression
in
her
eyes
and
then
looked
away
across
the
room
to
where
a
little
pile
of
accepted
invitations
lay
on
her
that
curious
light
at
once
of
battle
and
of
triumph
was
strong
upon
her
face
as
it
had
not
been
yet
she
said
at
last
and
there
was
an
unusual
ring
about
her
voice
am
quite
ready
for
you
something
more
than
the
furnishing
of
a
house
had
gone
to
the
preparation
of
a
place
in
society
for
the
widow
and
son
of
william
romayne
and
only
the
woman
who
had
effected
that
preparation
knew
how
and
how
completely
it
had
been
achieved
a
moment
later
face
had
changed
again
and
she
was
laughing
lightly
at
comments
as
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
hold
and
went
towards
the
bell
boy
she
said
as
she
rang
glad
you
think
nice
have
some
she
had
just
poured
him
out
a
cup
of
tea
and
quick
easy
question
and
answer
as
to
his
crossing
were
passing
between
them
when
the
bell
rang
and
she
broke
off
suddenly
in
her
speech
can
that
be
she
said
a
caller
it
must
be
six
now
i
wonder
whether
if
it
should
be
a
caller
dawson
will
have
the
sense
to
say
not
at
home
perhaps
i
had
better
she
rose
as
she
spoke
and
moved
quickly
across
the
room
to
the
door
but
she
was
too
late
as
she
opened
the
door
she
heard
the
street
door
open
below
and
heard
the
words
home
with
the
softest
possible
ejaculation
of
annoyance
she
closed
the
door
stealthily
a
nuisance
she
said
rapidly
a
time
to
call
i
trust
they
and
thereupon
her
face
changed
suddenly
and
completely
into
her
usual
society
smile
as
the
door
opened
again
and
she
rose
to
receive
her
visitors
dear
halse
she
exclaimed
what
a
delightful
surprise
now
say
that
you
have
come
to
tell
me
that
anything
has
gone
wrong
about
the
bazaar
she
continued
agitatedly
tell
me
that
miss
pomeroy
she
was
shaking
hands
with
her
younger
visitor
as
she
spoke
a
girl
of
apparently
about
twenty
very
correctly
dressed
as
pretty
as
a
girl
can
be
with
neither
colour
expression
nor
startlingly
correct
features
whose
eyes
are
for
the
most
part
fastened
on
the
ground
she
was
only
child
she
did
not
deal
romayne
the
blow
which
the
latter
appeared
to
anticipate
but
reassured
her
in
a
neatly
constructed
sentence
uttered
in
a
rather
demure
but
perfectly
voice
halse
had
been
prevented
for
the
moment
from
monopolising
the
conversation
by
reason
of
her
keen
interest
in
the
young
man
standing
by
the
fireplace
but
miss
words
were
hardly
uttered
before
she
turned
excitedly
to
romayne
if
she
was
going
to
make
a
mistake
the
disagreeables
of
the
position
would
be
with
her
hostess
she
had
decided
your
son
romayne
she
cried
must
be
surely
such
a
wonderful
likeness
only
really
i
can
hardly
believe
that
your
son
i
was
ridiculous
enough
to
expect
quite
a
boy
oh
say
that
he
has
just
arrived
and
we
are
interrupting
your
first
how
truly
frightful
let
me
tell
you
this
moment
what
i
came
for
and
fly
romayne
answered
her
with
a
suave
smile
am
going
to
introduce
my
boy
first
if
you
mind
she
said
and
then
as
julian
in
obedience
to
her
look
came
forward
with
the
easy
alacrity
of
a
young
man
whose
social
instincts
are
of
the
highly
civilised
kind
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
with
an
artificial
air
of
affectionate
pride
and
continued
lightly
first
london
introduction
julian
ralph
halse
miss
pomeroy
he
has
only
just
arrived
as
you
guessed
she
added
in
an
aside
to
halse
no
doubt
he
is
furiously
angry
with
me
for
allowing
him
to
be
caught
with
the
dust
of
his
journey
on
but
anger
was
not
perceptible
in
his
face
or
in
his
manner
which
was
very
pleasant
and
ready
even
after
he
had
handed
tea
and
cake
and
subsided
into
conversation
with
miss
pomeroy
halse
found
it
difficult
to
concentrate
herself
on
the
business
which
had
brought
her
to
chelsea
her
speech
to
romayne
as
to
the
brilliant
idea
which
had
struck
her
just
after
the
committee
broke
up
was
as
voluble
as
usual
certainly
but
less
connected
than
it
might
have
been
all
right
then
such
a
weight
off
my
mind
she
said
as
she
copied
an
address
into
her
with
a
circumstance
and
importance
which
would
have
befitted
the
settlement
of
the
fate
of
nations
is
so
important
to
get
things
settled
at
once
you
think
so
the
moment
it
occurred
to
me
i
saw
how
important
it
was
that
there
should
not
be
a
delay
and
i
said
to
maud
pomeroy
us
go
at
once
to
romayne
and
she
will
give
us
the
address
and
then
dear
pomeroy
can
write
the
letter
here
breath
gave
out
for
the
moment
and
she
let
her
eyes
which
had
strayed
constantly
in
the
direction
of
julian
and
miss
pomeroy
rest
on
the
young
face
must
have
your
son
among
the
stewards
romayne
she
said
important
now
i
wonder
whether
it
has
occurred
to
you
as
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
a
man
or
two
just
a
man
or
with
an
impressive
emphasis
on
the
last
word
as
though
three
men
would
be
altogether
beside
the
mark
be
rather
an
advantage
on
the
committee
now
what
is
your
opinion
romayne
you
think
you
could
be
very
useful
to
us
she
turned
towards
julian
as
she
spoke
quite
regardless
of
the
fact
that
miss
correctly
modulated
little
voice
was
stopped
by
her
tones
and
romayne
turned
towards
him
also
he
and
miss
pomeroy
were
sitting
together
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
as
her
eye
fell
upon
the
pair
a
curious
little
flash
as
of
an
idea
or
a
revelation
leaped
for
an
instant
into
eye
julian
moved
and
transferred
his
attention
to
halse
with
an
easy
courtesy
which
was
a
curiously
natural
reproduction
of
his
more
artificial
manner
and
which
was
at
the
same
time
very
young
and
unassuming
he
laughed
lightly
shall
be
delighted
to
be
a
steward
he
said
to
be
useful
in
any
way
but
the
idea
of
a
committee
is
would
make
great
fun
of
us
at
your
horrid
clubs
no
doubt
retorted
halse
i
know
what
you
young
men
are
but
you
can
be
rather
useful
in
these
cases
sometimes
though
of
course
it
do
to
tell
you
she
laughed
loudly
and
then
rose
with
a
sudden
access
of
haste
must
really
go
she
said
halse
had
innumerable
girl
friends
all
of
whom
she
was
wont
to
address
by
their
christian
names
we
are
behaving
abominably
we
stay
another
moment
not
another
but
they
did
stay
a
great
many
other
seconds
while
halse
pressed
julian
into
the
service
of
the
bazaar
in
all
sorts
and
kinds
of
capacities
and
managed
to
find
out
a
great
deal
about
his
past
life
in
the
process
when
at
last
she
swooped
down
upon
maud
pomeroy
metaphorically
speaking
as
though
that
eminently
decorous
young
lady
had
been
responsible
for
the
delay
and
carried
her
off
in
a
very
tornado
of
protestation
attended
to
the
front
door
as
in
courtesy
bound
by
julian
romayne
left
alone
in
the
let
her
face
relax
suddenly
from
its
responsive
brightness
into
an
unmistakeable
expression
of
feminine
irritation
and
dislike
woman
she
said
to
herself
me
well
she
will
talk
about
nothing
but
julian
all
this
evening
wherever
she
may
be
and
she
goes
everywhere
so
perhaps
it
has
been
worth
while
to
endure
then
as
julian
appeared
again
she
said
gaily
dear
boy
been
here
an
hour
and
we
shall
both
be
late
for
dinner
be
off
with
you
and
dress
it
was
a
very
cosy
little
dinner
that
followed
romayne
as
carefully
dressed
for
her
son
as
she
could
have
been
for
the
most
critical
stranger
was
also
at
her
brightest
and
most
responsive
they
talked
for
the
most
part
of
people
and
their
doings
society
gossip
romayne
told
julian
all
about
bazaar
deriding
the
whole
affair
as
an
excuse
for
deriding
its
promoter
but
with
no
realisation
of
its
innate
absurdity
and
giving
julian
to
understand
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
to
be
in
it
an
idea
which
he
was
evidently
quite
capable
of
appreciating
dinner
over
she
drew
his
arm
playfully
through
hers
and
took
him
all
over
the
house
me
see
that
you
approve
she
said
with
a
laughing
assumption
of
burlesque
suspense
the
last
room
into
which
she
took
him
was
the
little
room
at
the
back
of
the
and
as
his
previous
tone
of
appreciation
and
pleasure
developed
into
genuine
boyish
exclamations
of
delight
at
the
sight
of
it
the
intense
satisfaction
in
her
face
struck
oddly
on
her
manner
like
it
my
lord
she
said
disgraceful
extravagance
is
rewarded
by
your
gracious
approval
then
your
ridiculous
mother
is
silly
enough
to
be
she
gave
him
a
little
careless
touch
half
shake
and
half
caress
and
julian
threw
his
arm
round
her
rapturously
should
think
i
did
like
it
he
said
boyishly
say
i
have
to
work
hard
here
mother
what
an
awfully
jolly
smoking
table
you
smoke
here
now
suggested
romayne
way
of
taking
possession
oh
yes
stay
with
she
sat
down
as
she
spoke
in
one
of
the
low
by
the
fire
taking
a
little
from
the
mantelpiece
as
she
did
so
and
julian
with
an
exclamation
of
supreme
satisfaction
threw
himself
into
a
long
with
an
air
of
general
proprietorship
which
sat
oddly
on
his
youthful
figure
and
proceeded
to
select
and
light
a
cigar
a
silence
followed
rather
a
long
silence
julian
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
in
luxurious
contentment
romayne
sat
with
her
dainty
head
with
its
elaborate
arrangement
of
hair
resting
against
a
cushion
her
face
half
hidden
by
the
shade
thrown
by
the
as
she
held
it
up
in
one
slender
ringed
hand
she
seemed
to
be
looking
straight
into
the
fire
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
boyish
face
beside
her
she
was
the
first
to
break
silence
is
two
nearly
three
months
since
we
were
together
she
said
the
words
might
have
been
the
merest
comment
in
themselves
but
there
was
something
in
the
bright
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
something
half
suggestion
half
invitation
which
implied
a
desire
to
make
them
the
opening
of
a
conversation
julian
perceptions
however
were
by
no
means
of
the
acutest
and
he
detected
no
undertone
it
is
he
assented
with
dreamy
cheerfulness
long
did
you
spend
in
cairo
the
question
which
came
after
a
pause
was
evidently
another
attempt
on
a
new
line
again
it
failed
i
tell
you
ten
days
said
julian
lazily
romayne
changed
her
position
she
leant
forward
her
elbow
on
her
knee
her
cheek
resting
on
her
hand
the
screen
still
shading
her
face
catechism
is
going
to
begin
she
said
gaily
cigar
was
finished
he
roused
himself
and
dropped
the
end
into
the
by
his
side
as
he
said
with
a
smile
catechism
catechism
sir
returned
his
mother
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
let
you
off
without
insisting
on
a
full
and
particular
account
of
all
your
doings
during
the
last
ten
weeks
full
and
particular
account
of
all
my
doings
he
said
say
that
sounds
formidable
it
the
only
thing
is
had
it
in
my
fullest
and
most
particular
she
laughed
fullest
and
most
particular
mind
she
exclaimed
leaning
back
in
her
chair
again
with
a
restless
movement
shall
catechise
all
the
same
my
curiosity
knows
no
limits
you
see
now
you
are
on
your
honour
as
a
as
a
spoilt
boy
my
honour
as
a
spoilt
boy
all
right
fire
away
mum
he
pulled
himself
up
folding
his
hands
with
an
assumption
of
little
demeanour
and
laughing
into
her
face
she
also
drew
herself
up
and
laughed
back
at
him
one
have
you
lost
your
heart
to
any
pretty
girl
in
the
past
ten
weeks
two
have
you
flirted
much
with
any
girl
pretty
or
plain
you
overdrawn
your
allowance
mum
got
such
a
jolly
generous
mother
mum
you
oh
have
you
any
secrets
from
your
mother
the
question
broke
from
her
in
a
kind
of
cry
but
she
turned
it
before
it
was
finished
into
burlesque
and
julian
burst
into
a
shout
of
laughter
a
solitary
secret
there
will
that
do
she
was
looking
straight
into
his
face
her
own
still
in
shadow
and
there
was
a
pause
almost
a
breathless
pause
on
her
part
it
seemed
then
she
broke
into
a
laugh
will
do
capitally
she
said
catechism
is
she
rose
as
she
spoke
and
added
a
word
or
two
about
a
note
she
had
to
write
may
as
well
go
up
into
the
if
you
have
finished
smoking
she
said
is
an
invitation
from
some
friends
of
the
pomeroys
a
dinner
you
think
miss
pomeroy
a
very
pretty
girl
response
was
rather
languid
but
his
mother
did
not
press
the
point
she
turned
away
to
replace
the
screen
on
the
mantelpiece
and
as
she
did
so
a
thought
seemed
to
strike
her
julian
she
said
you
go
to
alexandria
what
about
those
curtains
you
were
to
get
me
her
back
was
towards
julian
and
she
did
not
notice
the
hesitation
which
preceded
his
reply
he
was
putting
his
into
his
pocket
and
the
process
seemed
to
demand
all
his
attention
go
to
alexandria
unfortunately
he
said
lightly
fosters
had
been
there
and
care
to
go
the
clock
struck
twelve
that
night
when
romayne
rose
at
last
from
the
chair
in
front
of
her
bedroom
fireplace
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
for
more
than
an
hour
the
fire
had
gone
out
before
her
eyes
unnoticed
and
she
shivered
a
little
as
she
rose
her
face
was
strangely
pale
and
and
the
hair
harmonised
ill
with
the
anxiety
of
its
look
begins
from
she
said
to
herself
is
his
life
that
begins
from
chapter
ix
a
presentable
fellow
there
was
an
unusual
ring
of
excitement
in
voice
it
was
about
ten
in
the
evening
and
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
her
own
looking
up
into
face
as
he
stood
before
her
having
just
come
into
the
room
smiling
back
at
her
with
a
certain
touch
of
excitement
about
his
appearance
also
he
was
in
evening
dress
he
had
evidently
bestowed
particular
pains
upon
his
attire
and
the
flower
in
his
buttonhole
was
an
exceptionally
dainty
one
romayne
was
also
in
evening
dress
and
in
evening
dress
of
the
most
elaborate
description
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
fashion
of
the
day
her
appearance
was
absolutely
perfect
no
detail
from
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
to
the
point
of
the
silk
shoe
just
visible
beneath
her
skirt
had
been
neglected
everything
was
in
good
taste
and
in
the
height
of
fashion
and
the
effect
of
the
whole
heightened
by
the
background
afforded
by
the
quiet
little
with
its
softly
shaded
lamps
was
almost
startling
in
its
suggestion
of
luxury
and
refinement
the
fashion
of
the
moment
was
peculiarly
becoming
to
romayne
and
evening
dress
with
its
artificialities
and
its
conventionalities
always
enhanced
her
good
points
strictly
conventional
as
they
were
with
that
light
of
excitement
on
her
face
and
a
certain
suggestion
about
her
of
verve
and
vivacity
she
looked
almost
charming
enough
to
justify
the
boyish
exclamations
of
exaggerated
admiration
into
which
julian
had
broken
on
entering
the
room
there
was
an
eager
restless
happiness
in
her
eyes
which
leapt
up
into
almost
triumphant
life
as
she
gave
a
little
touch
to
buttonhole
and
then
pushed
him
a
step
or
two
further
back
that
she
might
look
at
him
again
and
repeated
her
commendatory
words
with
a
laugh
then
on
a
little
gesture
from
her
he
picked
up
her
cloak
which
lay
on
a
chair
near
put
it
carefully
about
her
and
opening
the
door
for
her
followed
her
downstairs
nearly
three
weeks
had
elapsed
since
arrival
in
london
and
in
that
time
short
as
it
was
his
expression
had
changed
somewhat
there
was
a
quickened
interest
and
alertness
about
it
which
detracted
from
his
boyishness
inasmuch
as
it
made
him
look
as
though
life
had
actually
begun
for
him
it
would
have
been
wholly
untrue
to
say
that
any
touch
of
responsibility
or
ambition
had
dawned
upon
his
young
face
but
a
subtle
something
had
come
to
it
which
was
perhaps
a
materialisation
of
a
mental
movement
which
did
duty
for
those
emotions
in
the
course
of
those
three
weeks
he
had
had
several
interviews
with
the
man
with
whom
he
was
to
read
all
the
preliminaries
of
his
legal
career
had
been
settled
and
in
more
than
one
talk
with
his
mother
on
the
conclusion
of
some
arrangement
the
preliminaries
had
been
far
outstripped
and
he
had
been
conducted
in
triumph
to
the
bench
itself
but
in
all
these
buildings
of
castles
in
the
air
there
was
a
factor
in
the
foundations
of
his
fortunes
never
allowed
by
his
mother
to
drop
out
of
sight
the
main
factor
it
became
when
she
was
the
architect
relegating
to
a
subordinate
position
even
the
hard
work
on
which
julian
was
wont
to
expatiate
with
enthusiasm
and
energy
sometimes
as
a
means
sometimes
as
an
end
sometimes
as
the
sum
total
of
all
human
ambition
social
success
social
position
were
woven
into
all
his
schemes
for
the
future
as
they
talked
together
woven
in
with
no
direct
statements
or
precepts
but
with
an
insidious
insistence
and
a
tacit
assumption
of
their
value
in
the
scale
of
things
as
a
truism
in
no
need
of
formulation
society
life
had
begun
for
him
with
the
very
day
after
his
arrival
in
town
and
had
moved
briskly
with
him
through
the
following
weeks
briskly
but
in
a
small
way
easter
had
intervened
and
no
large
entertainments
had
been
given
was
to
be
as
romayne
said
gaily
as
she
settled
her
train
and
her
cloak
in
the
brougham
into
which
he
had
followed
her
his
first
public
appearance
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
first
of
the
coming
season
a
dance
to
be
given
at
a
house
in
park
lane
not
very
large
but
very
desirable
at
which
again
on
authority
all
the
right
people
would
be
must
dance
of
course
but
not
all
the
evening
julian
his
mother
said
as
their
drive
drew
to
an
end
shall
want
to
introduce
you
a
good
deal
and
engage
yourself
for
supper
if
you
can
help
it
sorry
to
be
so
hard
upon
you
she
finished
with
a
laugh
light
as
her
tone
had
been
throughout
then
their
carriage
drew
up
suddenly
and
her
face
in
shadow
for
the
moment
changed
strangely
for
an
instant
all
the
happiness
all
the
excitement
and
superficiality
died
out
of
it
quenched
in
a
kind
of
revelation
of
heartsick
anxiety
so
utterly
out
of
all
proportion
with
the
occasion
as
to
be
absolutely
ghastly
ghastly
as
only
a
momentary
revelation
of
the
cruel
and
incongruities
of
life
can
be
the
next
moment
as
julian
sprang
out
of
the
carriage
and
turned
to
help
her
out
her
expression
changed
again
it
took
them
some
time
to
get
up
to
the
for
though
the
party
was
by
no
means
a
crush
they
had
arrived
at
the
most
fashionable
moment
and
the
staircase
was
crowded
salutations
conveyed
by
graceful
movements
of
the
head
passed
across
an
intervening
barrier
of
gay
dresses
and
black
coats
between
romayne
and
numbers
of
acquaintances
above
her
or
below
her
on
the
stairs
and
as
she
smiled
and
bowed
she
murmured
comments
to
julian
names
or
data
criticisms
of
dress
or
appearance
until
at
last
patience
and
the
continual
movement
of
the
stream
of
which
they
made
part
brought
them
face
to
face
with
their
hostess
the
conventional
handshake
the
conventional
words
of
greeting
passed
between
that
lady
and
romayne
and
then
the
latter
indicated
julian
with
a
smiling
gesture
me
introduce
my
boy
lady
arden
she
said
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
she
spoke
with
an
accentuation
of
that
maternal
pride
which
was
her
usual
pose
setting
as
it
were
her
tone
for
the
night
and
certainly
julian
as
he
bowed
and
then
shook
the
hand
lady
arden
held
out
to
him
was
a
legitimate
subject
for
pride
his
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
occasion
had
given
to
his
manner
and
expression
not
only
that
touch
of
excitement
which
made
him
positively
handsome
but
a
certain
added
readiness
and
assurance
by
no
means
presuming
and
very
attractive
lady
eyes
rested
on
him
with
obvious
approval
as
she
said
the
few
words
the
situation
demanded
with
unusual
graciousness
and
a
sign
from
her
brought
one
of
her
daughters
to
her
side
she
introduced
julian
to
the
girl
care
of
romayne
ida
she
said
has
only
lately
come
to
london
find
him
some
nice
let
me
have
him
back
please
lady
ida
laughed
romayne
as
they
passed
on
with
the
girl
into
the
room
are
some
friends
of
his
to
whom
he
must
spare
a
little
time
the
gay
replies
with
which
julian
and
his
guide
who
after
a
comprehensive
glance
at
him
had
shown
considerable
readiness
to
do
her
bidding
disappeared
in
the
crowd
were
lost
to
romayne
her
attention
was
claimed
by
a
man
at
her
elbow
i
have
a
dance
romayne
he
said
romayne
shook
hands
and
laughed
really
i
know
she
said
think
i
must
give
up
dancing
from
got
a
great
son
here
do
you
know
look
there
he
is
with
lady
ida
arden
boy
he
it
seem
the
right
thing
for
his
mother
to
be
dancing
about
now
does
it
she
laughed
again
a
gay
little
laugh
well
in
the
key
she
had
set
in
her
first
introduction
of
julian
and
the
man
to
whom
she
spoke
protested
vigorously
seems
to
me
exactly
the
right
thing
he
said
idea
of
your
having
a
son
is
the
preposterous
point
you
know
come
i
say
romayne
be
so
horribly
i
must
introduce
him
you
see
i
must
do
my
duty
as
a
ida
is
introducing
him
she
has
introduced
him
to
of
the
best
girls
in
the
room
the
colloquy
carried
on
on
either
side
in
the
lightest
of
tones
finally
ended
in
promising
a
and
the
couple
drifted
apart
romayne
to
find
acquaintances
close
at
hand
among
the
first
she
met
was
lady
bracondale
condescendingly
amiable
to
whom
she
pointed
out
julian
with
laughing
he
was
dancing
now
and
dancing
extremely
well
am
so
absurdly
proud
of
him
she
said
want
to
introduce
him
to
you
if
i
can
catch
him
but
dancing
men
are
so
inconveniently
some
time
had
worn
away
and
she
had
repeated
the
substance
of
this
speech
in
sundry
forms
to
sundry
persons
before
julian
rejoined
her
she
had
cast
several
rather
preoccupied
glances
in
his
direction
when
she
became
aware
of
him
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
threading
his
way
through
the
intervening
groups
in
her
direction
just
as
she
was
accosted
by
a
rather
elderly
man
do
you
do
romayne
they
tell
me
that
you
have
a
son
here
and
i
decline
to
believe
he
spoke
in
a
pleasant
refined
voice
marred
however
by
all
the
affectation
of
the
day
and
with
a
tone
about
it
as
of
a
man
absolutely
secure
of
position
and
used
to
some
amount
of
homage
he
was
a
certain
lord
garstin
a
distinguished
figure
in
london
society
rich
and
idle
he
was
troubled
with
no
ideals
fashionable
women
with
all
the
weaknesses
which
he
knew
quite
well
were
quite
as
high
a
type
of
woman
as
he
thought
possible
or
at
least
desirable
and
he
had
a
considerable
admiration
for
romayne
as
a
very
and
attractive
specimen
of
the
type
he
preferred
she
shook
hands
with
him
with
a
laugh
and
a
gathering
together
of
her
social
resources
so
to
speak
which
suggested
that
in
her
scheme
of
things
he
was
a
power
whose
suffrage
was
eminently
desirable
is
true
notwithstanding
she
said
brightly
am
the
proud
possessor
of
a
son
lord
garstin
a
very
dear
boy
i
assure
you
we
are
settling
down
in
london
it
possible
was
the
answer
uttered
with
exaggerated
incredulity
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
may
i
ask
is
reading
for
the
bar
began
romayne
and
then
becoming
aware
that
the
subject
of
her
words
had
by
this
time
reached
her
side
she
turned
slightly
and
laid
her
hand
on
arm
with
a
pretty
gesture
he
is
she
said
me
introduce
him
julian
this
is
lord
garstin
he
has
been
kindly
asking
me
about
julian
knew
all
about
lord
garstin
and
his
tone
and
manner
as
he
responded
to
his
words
were
touched
with
a
deference
which
made
them
as
his
mother
said
to
herself
what
they
ought
to
the
elder
man
looked
him
over
with
eyes
which
as
far
as
their
vision
extended
were
as
keen
as
eyes
need
be
great
many
of
your
admirers
will
find
it
difficult
to
realise
your
existence
he
said
pleasantly
of
course
we
have
all
heard
of
you
you
are
going
to
the
bar
eh
lord
garstin
had
a
great
following
among
smart
young
men
and
the
fact
was
rather
a
weakness
of
his
he
liked
to
have
young
men
about
him
to
be
admired
and
imitated
by
them
his
manner
to
julian
was
characteristic
of
these
tastes
free
from
condescension
as
superiority
can
only
be
when
it
is
absolute
and
unassailable
and
full
of
easy
familiarity
romayne
standing
fanning
herself
between
them
listened
for
reply
with
a
certain
intent
suspense
beneath
her
smile
lord
approval
was
so
important
to
him
the
simple
unaffected
frankness
of
the
answer
satisfied
her
ear
and
lord
expression
as
he
listened
to
it
satisfied
her
eye
and
with
a
laughing
comment
on
words
she
allowed
her
attention
to
be
drawn
away
for
the
moment
by
an
acquaintance
who
claimed
it
in
passing
there
was
a
slight
flush
of
elation
on
her
face
when
a
few
moments
later
the
chat
between
lord
garstin
and
julian
being
broken
off
the
former
moved
away
with
a
friendly
nod
to
the
young
man
and
a
little
gesture
and
smile
to
herself
significant
of
congratulation
and
walk
round
the
room
she
said
gaily
slipping
her
hand
through
arm
are
hundreds
of
people
you
must
be
introduced
during
the
that
followed
julian
was
introduced
to
a
large
proportion
of
those
people
in
the
room
who
were
best
worth
knowing
romayne
seemed
to
have
wasted
no
time
on
the
acquaintance
of
mediocrities
his
presentation
to
lady
bracondale
had
just
been
accomplished
when
halse
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
greeted
romayne
with
stereotyped
enthusiasm
a
success
she
said
in
a
loud
whisper
as
julian
talked
to
lady
bracondale
is
quite
taken
by
surprise
i
know
why
sure
but
i
think
any
one
was
prepared
for
such
a
charming
young
man
been
quite
in
love
with
him
ever
since
i
saw
him
first
you
know
and
we
really
must
have
him
on
the
bazaar
halse
had
been
out
of
town
for
easter
and
the
affairs
of
the
bazaar
had
been
somewhat
in
abeyance
in
consequence
romayne
she
continued
seizing
upon
julian
want
to
talk
to
you
you
really
must
help
me
at
this
juncture
the
man
who
had
pressed
romayne
to
dance
earlier
in
the
evening
came
up
to
her
and
claimed
the
promise
she
had
made
him
then
she
cast
a
glance
of
laughing
pity
at
julian
intended
for
his
eyes
alone
and
moved
away
was
too
bad
mother
he
declared
laughing
as
he
met
her
a
little
later
coming
out
of
the
to
make
up
you
must
have
one
turn
with
me
just
one
we
danced
together
for
he
was
full
of
eagerness
a
little
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
the
evening
and
her
laughing
protestations
her
ridicule
of
him
for
wanting
to
dance
with
his
mother
went
for
nothing
they
only
let
loose
on
her
a
torrent
of
boyish
persuasion
and
finally
she
hesitated
laughed
undecidedly
and
yielded
she
too
was
a
little
flushed
and
elated
as
though
with
triumph
turn
then
you
absurd
boy
she
said
and
she
let
him
draw
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
lead
her
back
into
the
they
went
only
times
round
the
room
in
spite
of
his
protestations
against
stopping
but
romayne
was
too
excellent
a
dancer
and
too
striking
a
figure
for
those
turns
to
pass
unnoticed
when
she
stopped
and
made
him
take
her
flushed
and
laughing
out
of
the
room
she
was
instantly
surrounded
by
a
group
of
men
vehemently
reproaching
her
for
dancing
with
her
son
to
the
exclusion
of
so
many
partners
and
laughingly
denouncing
julian
help
it
she
protested
gaily
i
know
a
ridiculous
sight
but
we
are
rather
ridiculous
we
two
you
know
come
julian
take
me
home
this
moment
let
me
disappear
covered
with
she
went
swiftly
downstairs
as
she
spoke
laughing
prettily
and
a
few
minutes
later
julian
with
a
good
deal
of
extraneous
and
wholly
unnecessary
assistance
was
putting
her
into
her
carriage
the
whole
evening
had
gone
off
admirably
romayne
said
the
next
morning
repeating
the
dictum
with
which
she
had
parted
from
julian
at
night
with
less
excitement
but
with
undiminished
satisfaction
during
the
course
of
the
next
three
or
four
weeks
that
satisfaction
a
certain
genuine
and
deliberate
satisfaction
which
seemed
to
underlie
the
superficial
gaiety
and
brightness
of
her
manner
seemed
to
grow
upon
her
the
season
had
begun
early
and
very
gaily
and
she
and
julian
were
in
great
request
it
was
perhaps
as
well
that
little
work
was
expected
of
the
embryo
barrister
before
the
winter
for
he
and
his
mother
were
out
night
after
night
welcomed
and
made
much
of
wherever
they
went
as
so
attractive
a
pair
one
of
whom
was
steeped
to
the
in
knowledge
of
her
world
were
sure
to
be
romayne
arranged
a
series
of
weekly
in
the
little
house
at
chelsea
which
promised
to
be
in
a
small
way
one
of
the
features
of
the
season
they
were
very
small
very
select
and
very
cheery
no
better
hostess
was
to
be
found
in
london
and
there
was
a
touch
of
sentiment
about
the
relation
between
the
hostess
and
the
pleasant
young
host
which
was
by
no
means
without
charm
for
the
guests
bazaar
too
which
was
affording
far
more
entertainment
to
its
promoters
than
it
seemed
at
all
likely
to
afford
to
its
supporters
served
to
bring
julian
into
special
prominence
he
was
not
clever
but
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
done
in
connection
with
a
bazaar
on
which
intellect
would
be
thrown
away
and
julian
proved
himself
what
halse
described
effusively
as
most
useful
dear
an
expression
by
which
she
probably
meant
to
convey
the
fact
that
he
was
always
ready
to
toil
for
the
committee
without
too
close
an
investigation
into
the
end
to
be
attained
by
the
said
toiling
he
was
quite
an
important
person
at
all
the
meetings
connected
with
the
bazaar
and
the
fact
gave
him
a
standing
with
the
innumerable
people
concerned
which
he
would
otherwise
hardly
have
attained
so
soon
his
introduction
to
lord
garstin
resulted
about
a
fortnight
after
it
took
place
in
an
invitation
to
a
bachelor
dinner
an
invitation
to
one
of
lord
dinners
was
in
its
way
about
as
desirable
a
thing
as
a
young
man
could
receive
and
the
pleased
repressed
importance
on
face
as
he
came
into
the
to
his
mother
before
he
started
to
keep
the
engagement
was
like
a
faint
reflection
of
the
satisfaction
with
which
expression
was
transfused
going
she
said
brightly
i
shall
be
at
the
by
eleven
and
i
shall
expect
you
there
some
time
before
twelve
enjoy
yourself
sir
he
kissed
her
with
careless
affection
and
she
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
for
a
conceited
boy
as
he
hoped
lightly
that
she
would
not
find
her
solitary
evening
dull
she
had
refused
to
dine
out
without
him
saying
laughingly
that
she
should
enjoy
a
holiday
and
then
he
went
off
whistling
gaily
and
arranging
his
buttonhole
it
wanted
a
few
minutes
only
to
the
when
he
arrived
at
the
club
where
the
dinner
was
to
be
given
three
of
his
fellow
guests
were
already
assembled
and
to
two
of
these
young
men
about
town
he
had
already
been
introduced
know
these
two
fellows
i
think
said
lord
garstin
lightly
turning
to
the
third
man
tells
me
that
you
and
he
have
not
yet
been
introduced
delighted
to
perform
the
ceremony
julian
romayne
marston
loring
julian
held
out
his
hand
with
a
frank
exclamation
of
pleasure
he
had
recognised
in
marston
loring
a
young
man
whom
he
had
seen
about
incessantly
during
the
past
month
and
who
had
excited
a
good
deal
of
secret
and
boyish
admiration
in
him
by
reason
of
a
certain
assumption
of
cynicism
with
which
an
excellent
society
manner
was
just
sufficiently
seasoned
to
give
it
character
it
was
conventional
character
enough
but
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
julian
should
understand
that
awfully
glad
to
meet
you
he
said
pleasantly
known
you
by
sight
for
ages
i
you
was
the
answer
spoken
with
a
slight
smile
and
a
touch
of
cordiality
which
delighted
julian
pleasure
is
distinctly
marston
loring
was
not
a
young
man
his
features
indeed
would
have
been
insignificant
but
for
the
presence
of
that
spurious
air
of
refinement
which
life
in
society
usually
produces
and
for
something
more
genuine
namely
a
strength
and
resolution
about
the
mould
of
his
chin
and
the
set
of
his
thin
lips
which
had
won
him
a
reputation
for
being
among
the
superficial
observers
of
the
social
world
he
was
but
his
face
might
have
been
the
face
of
a
man
twenty
years
older
so
entirely
destitute
was
it
of
any
of
the
gracious
possibilities
which
should
characterise
early
manhood
it
was
pale
and
lined
and
worn
with
very
ugly
suggestiveness
and
there
were
stories
told
about
him
whispered
and
laughed
at
in
many
of
the
houses
where
he
was
received
which
accounted
amply
for
those
lines
the
pose
too
which
it
pleased
him
to
adopt
was
that
of
elderly
superiority
to
all
the
illusions
and
credulities
of
youth
marston
loring
was
a
man
of
whom
it
was
vaguely
but
universally
said
that
he
had
on
so
well
reduced
to
facts
this
statement
meant
primarily
that
with
no
particular
rights
in
that
direction
he
had
gradually
worked
his
way
into
a
position
in
society
a
position
the
insecurity
and
unreality
of
which
was
known
only
to
himself
and
secondarily
that
by
dint
of
influence
hard
work
hard
work
was
also
part
of
his
pose
and
a
certain
amount
of
unscrupulousness
he
was
making
money
at
the
bar
when
most
men
dependent
on
their
profession
would
have
starved
at
it
he
had
brown
eyes
dull
and
curiously
but
very
keen
and
calculating
and
they
were
even
keener
than
usual
as
they
gave
julian
one
quick
look
think
we
belong
to
the
same
profession
he
said
with
easy
friendliness
are
reading
with
allardyce
are
you
not
a
good
man
they
tell
me
answered
julian
not
a
little
impressed
by
the
critical
and
experienced
tone
of
the
approbation
say
done
much
with
him
yet
one
do
much
at
this
time
of
year
you
loring
smiled
rather
sardonically
what
it
is
to
be
a
gentleman
of
independent
fortune
he
said
people
have
to
burn
the
candle
at
both
the
five
chat
which
ensued
before
the
arrival
of
the
fifth
guest
a
certain
lord
hesseltine
known
only
by
sight
to
julian
and
the
announcement
of
dinner
was
just
enough
to
create
a
regret
in
mind
when
he
found
that
he
and
his
new
acquaintance
were
seated
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
contribution
to
the
general
conversation
throughout
dinner
witty
cynical
and
assured
completed
his
conquest
and
when
on
the
subsequent
adjournment
of
the
party
to
the
loring
strolled
up
to
him
cigar
in
hand
the
prospect
of
a
was
greatly
to
satisfaction
an
odd
thing
it
is
that
we
should
never
have
been
introduced
before
he
began
lighting
his
own
cigar
and
scanning
the
other
man
with
youthful
admiring
eyes
is
odd
returned
loring
placidly
throwing
himself
into
an
as
he
spoke
and
signing
an
invitation
to
julian
to
establish
himself
in
another
as
like
every
one
else
been
an
immense
admirer
of
your
mother
all
this
year
i
wonder
whether
you
recognise
what
a
lucky
fellow
you
are
romayne
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
at
the
easy
familiarity
of
the
address
and
he
crossed
his
legs
with
careless
as
he
answered
with
the
lightness
of
youth
ought
to
i
i
say
i
know
my
mother
would
be
awfully
pleased
to
know
you
you
must
let
me
introduce
you
to
her
are
you
coming
on
to
the
shall
be
only
too
delighted
answered
loring
watching
the
smoke
from
his
cigar
with
his
dull
brown
eyes
and
answering
the
first
part
of
speech
unfortunately
got
an
affair
in
chelsea
and
another
in
kensington
but
we
shall
meet
night
at
the
i
suppose
course
assented
julian
eagerly
will
be
capital
there
was
a
pause
broken
by
loring
with
a
reference
to
a
political
opinion
formulated
by
one
of
the
other
men
at
dinner
and
a
talk
about
politics
ensued
eager
on
part
cynical
and
effectively
reserved
on
a
political
discussion
when
the
discussers
hold
the
same
political
faith
has
much
the
same
effect
in
promoting
rapid
intimacy
between
men
granted
a
predisposition
towards
intimacy
on
either
side
as
a
discussion
of
the
reigning
fashion
in
dress
has
with
a
certain
class
of
women
when
lord
began
to
break
up
and
loring
and
julian
rose
to
take
their
departure
they
parted
with
a
which
would
have
befitted
an
acquaintanceship
three
months
rather
than
three
hours
old
night
said
julian
pleased
to
have
met
you
loring
see
you
night
my
mother
will
be
shall
be
delighted
said
loring
right
then
night
arrange
that
look
in
at
the
house
good
a
few
talk
with
lord
garstin
who
had
taken
a
decided
fancy
to
charming
little
boy
and
julian
was
standing
on
the
pavement
of
street
with
that
pleasant
sense
of
exhilaration
and
warmth
of
heart
which
is
an
attendant
in
youth
on
the
inauguration
of
a
new
friendship
it
was
a
night
in
early
may
and
a
fine
hot
day
had
ended
as
evening
drew
on
in
sultry
closeness
the
clouds
had
been
rolling
up
steadily
though
not
a
breath
of
air
seemed
to
be
stirring
now
and
it
was
evident
that
a
storm
was
inevitable
before
long
julian
was
hot
and
excited
he
had
only
a
short
distance
to
go
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
decided
the
wish
being
father
to
the
thought
that
it
would
up
for
the
present
and
that
he
would
walk
he
set
out
up
street
and
along
piccadilly
taking
the
right
road
by
instinct
his
busy
thoughts
divided
between
satisfaction
at
the
idea
of
belonging
to
the
club
in
london
introduced
thereinto
by
lord
garstin
and
loring
and
his
gifts
and
graces
he
had
just
turned
into
berkeley
street
when
a
rattling
peal
of
thunder
roused
him
with
a
start
and
the
next
instant
the
thunder
was
followed
by
a
perfect
deluge
of
rain
it
was
so
sudden
and
he
was
so
entirely
unprepared
that
his
only
instinct
for
the
moment
was
to
step
back
hastily
into
the
shelter
of
a
portico
in
front
of
which
he
was
just
passing
and
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
a
young
woman
who
must
have
been
following
him
up
the
street
a
young
woman
in
the
shabby
hat
and
jacket
of
a
take
refuge
perforce
beneath
the
same
shelter
with
a
shrinking
movement
which
was
not
undignified
though
it
seemed
to
imply
that
she
was
almost
more
afraid
of
him
than
of
the
drenching
bitter
rain
then
his
reasoning
powers
reasserting
themselves
in
the
comparative
security
of
the
portico
he
began
to
consider
what
he
should
do
he
was
within
seven
walk
of
his
destination
but
seven
walk
in
such
rain
as
was
beating
down
on
the
pavement
before
him
would
render
him
wholly
unfit
to
present
himself
at
a
party
and
course
as
he
said
to
himself
there
was
not
a
cab
to
be
seen
a
blinding
flash
of
lightning
cut
across
his
reflections
and
drove
him
back
a
step
or
two
farther
into
shelter
involuntarily
and
as
a
terrific
peal
of
thunder
followed
it
instantaneously
he
glanced
almost
unconsciously
at
the
sharer
of
his
shelter
jove
he
said
to
himself
the
girl
had
retreated
as
he
himself
had
done
and
was
standing
close
up
against
the
door
of
the
house
to
which
the
portico
belonged
in
the
extreme
corner
from
that
which
he
himself
occupied
but
except
for
that
tacit
acknowledgement
of
his
presence
she
seemed
no
longer
conscious
of
it
she
was
looking
straight
out
at
the
storm
her
head
a
little
lifted
as
though
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
sky
and
her
face
outlined
by
her
dark
clothes
and
the
dark
paint
of
the
door
behind
her
stood
out
in
great
distinctness
it
was
rather
thin
and
pale
and
very
the
large
brown
eyes
were
heavy
and
haggard
it
was
not
worthy
of
a
second
glance
at
that
moment
according
to
any
canon
of
the
world
in
which
julian
lived
and
yet
it
drew
from
him
that
exclamation
of
startled
admiration
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
he
told
himself
vaguely
apparently
the
intent
gaze
of
which
he
himself
was
hardly
conscious
affected
its
object
she
moved
uneasily
and
turning
as
if
involuntarily
met
his
eyes
the
next
instant
she
was
moving
hastily
from
under
the
portico
when
the
driver
of
a
hansom
cab
became
aware
of
existence
and
pulled
up
suddenly
sir
he
shouted
answered
julian
quickly
dashing
across
the
drenched
pavement
hundred
and
three
berkeley
square
chapter
x
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
in
chelsea
were
bright
and
pretty
and
by
no
means
the
least
attractive
was
the
the
late
fixed
by
romayne
for
the
season
as
she
said
gave
plenty
of
time
for
the
sun
to
find
its
way
in
at
the
windows
and
on
the
morning
following
dinner
with
lord
garstin
the
sunshine
was
dancing
on
the
walls
and
the
soft
warm
air
floating
in
at
the
open
windows
as
though
the
thunderstorm
of
the
previous
evening
had
cleared
the
air
to
some
purpose
the
two
occupants
of
the
room
as
they
faced
one
another
across
the
dainty
little
had
been
laughing
and
talking
after
their
usual
fashion
ever
since
they
sat
down
talking
of
the
party
of
the
night
before
and
of
engagements
in
the
future
and
finally
reverting
to
lord
dinner
and
marston
loring
of
whom
julian
had
already
had
a
great
deal
to
say
have
a
kind
of
feeling
that
he
and
i
are
going
to
be
chums
mother
he
said
as
he
carried
his
round
the
table
to
her
to
be
refilled
think
he
took
to
me
rather
do
you
know
a
very
surprising
thing
it
returned
his
mother
laughing
you
took
to
him
well
if
you
must
pick
up
a
chum
you
do
it
under
better
auspices
than
lord
took
to
him
no
end
answered
julian
eagerly
do
hope
like
think
i
am
pretty
sure
to
like
him
said
romayne
graciously
remember
hearing
about
him
some
time
ago
that
he
was
quite
one
of
the
rising
young
men
of
the
day
he
was
to
have
been
introduced
to
me
then
i
forget
why
it
come
off
your
coffee
julian
took
his
cup
with
a
word
of
thanks
and
turned
back
to
his
chair
and
his
mother
began
again
loring
is
a
member
of
the
i
suppose
she
said
the
was
the
name
of
the
club
at
which
lord
dinner
had
been
given
suppose
you
will
want
to
be
setting
up
a
club
in
no
time
sir
julian
laughed
and
then
replied
somewhat
eagerly
and
confidentially
as
though
in
unconscious
response
to
a
certain
invitation
in
his
tone
of
course
a
fellow
does
want
a
club
mother
he
said
feels
it
more
and
more
you
know
of
course
i
should
awfully
like
to
belong
to
the
why
not
responded
his
mother
brightly
watching
him
rather
narrowly
as
she
spoke
garstin
would
put
you
up
no
doubt
if
i
asked
eyes
sparkled
would
be
he
exclaimed
awfully
jolly
of
you
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
continued
tentatively
would
be
rather
expensive
you
know
the
only
thing
i
suppose
answered
his
mother
laughing
a
very
expensive
luxury
altogether
however
i
imagine
another
hundred
a
year
would
do
then
as
he
broke
into
vehement
demonstrations
of
delight
and
gratitude
she
added
with
another
laugh
which
did
not
seem
to
ring
quite
true
think
you
need
ever
run
short
of
money
there
was
a
pause
as
julian
the
picture
of
glowing
satisfaction
finished
his
breakfast
and
then
romayne
rose
are
you
going
to
do
this
morning
she
said
julian
glanced
out
of
the
window
he
said
an
awfully
jolly
morning
it
i
promised
to
see
after
some
for
miss
stall
puppies
and
kittens
and
canary
birds
rum
idea
it
what
are
you
doing
this
morning
dear
it
turned
out
that
romayne
had
nothing
particular
on
her
hands
beyond
a
visit
to
a
jeweller
in
bond
street
and
accepting
very
easily
his
substitution
of
miss
commission
for
the
legal
studies
to
which
he
was
supposed
to
devote
himself
in
the
mornings
she
took
up
his
reference
to
the
weather
and
suggested
that
they
should
drive
together
to
execute
first
his
business
and
then
her
own
will
be
rather
nice
driving
this
morning
she
said
we
can
take
a
turn
in
the
certainly
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
excuse
for
those
people
who
had
already
begun
to
say
that
romayne
was
never
happy
without
her
son
by
her
side
she
spared
no
pains
however
to
make
him
happy
with
her
and
as
they
drove
along
there
was
probably
no
brighter
or
brisker
talk
than
theirs
in
progress
in
all
london
they
drove
through
the
west
end
streets
and
penetrated
in
search
of
miss
requirements
into
regions
into
which
romayne
had
hardly
ever
penetrated
before
regions
which
rather
amused
her
in
their
squalor
when
julian
had
done
his
commission
in
plenty
of
time
to
undo
it
and
do
it
again
before
the
bazaar
came
off
as
he
remarked
with
a
laugh
they
turned
back
again
and
went
to
bond
street
have
a
little
private
matter
to
attend
to
here
said
julian
as
he
followed
his
mother
into
the
shop
just
have
the
kindness
to
stop
at
your
end
of
the
shop
will
you
please
and
leave
me
to
mine
romayne
laughed
and
shook
her
head
at
him
it
was
within
a
few
days
of
her
birthday
which
was
always
demonstratively
honoured
by
her
son
you
are
not
to
be
extravagant
she
said
holding
up
a
slender
threatening
finger
with
mock
severity
i
will
not
have
it
i
shall
descend
upon
you
unawares
and
keep
you
in
she
let
him
leave
her
with
another
laugh
and
he
disappeared
to
the
other
end
of
the
shop
while
she
followed
a
shopman
to
a
counter
near
the
door
just
turning
away
from
it
she
met
pomeroy
and
her
daughter
this
is
really
most
delightful
exclaimed
pomeroy
if
any
speech
so
comfortable
and
so
entirely
unexcited
may
be
described
as
an
exclamation
is
always
charming
to
see
you
dear
romayne
of
course
but
it
really
is
particularly
charming
this
morning
it
maud
very
nice
said
romayne
brightly
turning
to
maud
pomeroy
with
a
smile
and
pressing
the
hand
with
an
affectionate
familiarity
developed
in
her
with
regard
to
miss
pomeroy
by
the
last
few
weeks
a
hardly
perceptible
touch
of
additional
satisfaction
had
come
to
her
face
as
she
saw
the
mother
and
daughter
tell
me
why
of
course
said
pomeroy
placidly
she
sat
down
as
she
spoke
with
that
instinct
for
personal
ease
under
all
circumstances
which
was
her
ruling
characteristic
is
just
what
i
want
to
do
my
dear
romayne
it
is
the
bazaar
of
course
it
really
is
a
most
awkward
thing
it
maud
it
seems
that
we
have
asked
ladies
all
most
important
to
become
and
we
possibly
make
room
for
more
than
eighteen
stalls
now
what
would
you
ah
romayne
how
do
you
do
pomeroy
had
broken
off
her
tale
of
woe
as
placidly
as
she
had
begun
it
and
had
greeted
julian
with
comfortable
cordiality
he
had
come
up
hastily
not
becoming
aware
of
his
companions
until
he
was
close
to
them
is
awfully
lucky
for
me
he
exclaimed
want
a
lady
desperately
for
half
a
minute
and
my
mother
do
miss
pomeroy
turning
eagerly
to
the
demure
figure
standing
by
side
you
come
to
the
other
end
of
the
shop
with
me
for
half
a
minute
it
would
be
awfully
good
of
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
tone
of
fashionable
the
pseudo
which
passes
for
the
real
thing
in
society
which
as
addressed
by
julian
romayne
to
miss
pomeroy
and
her
mother
was
one
of
the
results
of
his
work
in
connection
with
the
bazaar
and
before
miss
pomeroy
could
answer
romayne
interposed
somebody
very
frequently
did
interpose
when
miss
pomeroy
was
addressed
no
one
ever
seemed
to
expect
opinions
or
decisions
from
her
perhaps
because
she
was
her
daughter
perhaps
because
of
her
curiously
characterless
exterior
while
the
fact
that
she
had
never
been
known
to
controvert
a
statement
in
words
doubtless
accentuated
the
tendency
of
her
acquaintance
to
make
statements
for
her
will
be
awfully
good
of
you
romayne
said
to
her
now
laughing
you
are
kind
enough
to
help
this
silly
fellow
to
insist
on
his
remembering
that
his
mother
will
be
very
angry
indeed
if
he
is
extravagant
i
shall
have
to
give
up
having
a
birthday
i
then
as
julian
with
a
gay
gesture
of
repression
to
his
mother
waited
for
miss
answer
with
another
pleading
would
be
ever
so
good
of
you
the
girl
with
a
glance
at
her
mother
said
with
a
conventional
smile
pleasure
and
walked
away
by
his
side
pomeroy
looked
after
julian
with
an
approving
smile
he
was
a
favourite
of
hers
a
nice
fellow
she
murmured
amiably
and
romayne
laughed
her
pretty
laugh
glad
you
find
him
so
she
said
dear
pomeroy
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
a
marston
loring
he
goes
everywhere
he
i
think
i
have
seen
him
at
your
yes
returned
pomeroy
as
placidly
as
ever
but
with
a
decision
which
indicated
that
she
was
giving
expression
to
a
popular
verdict
not
merely
to
an
opinion
of
her
own
is
quite
a
young
man
to
know
very
clever
and
rising
i
know
what
his
people
were
he
has
been
so
successful
that
it
really
signify
you
know
he
lives
in
chambers
i
remember
where
but
it
is
a
very
good
he
money
asked
romayne
really
know
said
pomeroy
is
doing
extremely
well
at
the
bar
by
the
way
they
say
and
herewith
pomeroy
lowered
her
voice
and
confided
to
her
interlocutor
two
or
three
details
in
connection
with
marston
private
life
the
life
which
in
the
world
no
one
is
supposed
to
recognise
which
might
have
been
considered
by
no
means
to
his
credit
they
were
not
details
which
affected
his
society
character
in
any
way
however
and
romayne
only
laughed
with
such
slight
affectation
of
reprobation
as
a
woman
of
the
world
should
show
are
all
alike
i
suppose
she
said
with
that
fashionable
indulgence
which
has
probably
done
as
much
as
anything
else
towards
making
men
he
was
lord
best
man
he
pomeroy
was
just
confirming
to
marston
loring
what
was
evidently
a
certificate
of
social
merit
when
julian
and
miss
pomeroy
reappeared
and
romayne
with
an
exclamation
at
herself
as
a
gossip
turned
to
the
shopman
who
had
been
waiting
her
pleasure
at
a
discreet
distance
and
transacted
her
business
settled
anything
about
this
trying
business
of
the
said
pomeroy
plaintively
as
she
finished
i
wonder
we
were
thinking
of
taking
a
turn
in
the
park
we
maud
pomeroy
had
a
curious
little
habit
of
constantly
referring
to
her
daughter
would
be
so
kind
of
you
dear
romayne
if
you
would
send
your
carriage
home
and
take
a
turn
with
us
you
and
romayne
and
i
would
take
you
home
of
course
i
really
am
anxious
to
know
what
you
advise
for
there
seems
to
be
an
idea
that
i
am
in
some
way
responsible
for
the
awkwardness
so
absurd
you
know
i
am
quite
sure
i
have
only
done
as
i
was
apparently
it
had
not
occurred
to
pomeroy
that
to
do
as
you
are
told
by
four
or
five
different
people
with
totally
different
ends
in
view
is
apt
to
lead
to
confusion
romayne
fell
in
with
the
plan
proposed
after
an
demur
with
smiling
alacrity
and
the
in
the
that
followed
was
a
very
gay
one
miss
pomeroy
and
julian
laughed
and
talked
together
that
is
to
say
julian
laughed
and
talked
in
the
best
of
good
spirits
and
miss
pomeroy
put
in
just
the
correct
words
and
pretty
smiles
which
were
wanted
to
keep
his
conversation
in
full
swing
romayne
and
pomeroy
facing
them
disposed
of
the
difficulty
in
connection
with
the
bazaar
after
a
good
deal
of
irrelevant
discussion
by
saying
very
often
and
in
a
great
many
words
that
three
more
stalls
must
be
got
in
somewhere
a
decision
which
seemed
to
pomeroy
to
make
everything
perfectly
right
although
she
had
had
it
elaborately
demonstrated
to
her
that
such
a
course
was
absolutely
impossible
it
was
one
when
romayne
and
julian
were
put
down
at
their
own
door
and
the
barouche
drove
off
amid
a
chorus
of
light
laughter
and
last
words
the
sunshine
the
fresh
air
the
movement
or
something
less
simple
and
less
physical
seemed
to
have
had
a
most
exhilarating
effect
on
romayne
her
face
was
almost
as
radiant
in
its
curiously
different
fashion
as
was
radiant
with
the
unreasoning
good
spirits
of
youth
nice
people
she
said
lightly
wonder
whether
lunch
is
ready
quite
starving
oh
letters
taking
up
three
or
four
which
lay
on
the
us
trust
they
are
interesting
she
turned
into
the
as
she
spoke
sorting
the
envelopes
in
her
hand
for
you
your
friend
von
mühler
it
she
said
tossing
it
to
julian
carelessly
for
me
an
invitation
obviously
one
from
ponsonby
about
her
stall
i
suppose
and
one
from
she
stopped
suddenly
the
last
letter
of
the
pile
was
contained
in
a
small
square
envelope
and
addressed
in
what
was
obviously
a
handwriting
a
good
handwriting
clear
and
strong
but
somewhat
cramped
and
precise

a
curious
stillness
seemed
to
come
over
the
little
alert
figure
as
the
pale
blue
eyes
caught
sight
of
the
writing
and
then
romayne
moved
and
walked
slowly
away
to
the
window
still
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
envelope
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
she
opened
it
and
drew
out
a
sheet
of
bearing
a
few
lines

the
same

clear
hand

and
what
have
your
correspondents
got
to
say
i
have
had
no
end
of
a
screed
from
von
nearly
ten
minutes
had
passed
and
romayne
started
violently
she
thrust
the
letter
still
open
in
her
hand
though
she
was
looking
fixedly
out
of
the
window
back
into
its
envelope
and
turned
her
face
had
altered
curiously
and
completely
all
its
colour
all
the
genuine
animation
which
had
pervaded
it
as
she
came
into
the
room
had
disappeared
it
was
pale
and
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
and
eyes
were
very
visible
dinner
invitation
from
lady
ashton
she
said
a
long
rigmarole
from
ponsonby
to
tell
me
that
she
is
resigning
her
stall
and
why
she
is
doing
it
poor
pomeroy
should
be
grateful
to
her
her
tone
was
an
exaggeration
of
her
bright
carelessness
of
ten
minutes
before
forced
and
unnatural
her
back
was
towards
the
window
or
even
boyish
eyes
might
have
noticed
the
stiff
unreality
of
the
smile
with
which
she
spoke
they
sat
down
to
lunch
together
but
the
strange
change
which
had
come
to
her
did
not
pass
away
julian
did
most
of
the
talking
though
the
readiness
of
her
comments
and
her
smiles
which
left
her
lips
always
hard
and
set
and
never
seemed
to
touch
her
eyes
prevented
his
being
in
the
least
aware
of
the
fact
their
afternoon
was
spent
apart
but
when
they
met
again
there
was
that
about
her
face
which
made
julian
say
with
some
surprise
you
tired
mother
they
were
going
to
a
large
before
the
very
smart
to
which
julian
and
loring
had
referred
on
the
previous
evening
as
an
opportunity
for
meeting
and
romayne
was
magnificently
dressed
there
were
diamonds
round
her
throat
and
in
her
hair
and
as
they
flashed
and
sparkled
seeming
to
lend
glow
and
animation
to
her
face
as
she
laughed
at
him
for
a
ridiculous
boy
julian
thought
carelessly
that
he
must
have
imagined
the
drawn
look
which
had
struck
him
though
he
had
only
recognised
it
as
on
his
face
as
though
his
words
had
startled
or
even
annoyed
her
she
gave
neither
julian
nor
any
one
else
any
further
excuse
for
taxing
her
with
fatigue
throughout
the
long
and
rather
dull
dinner
she
was
vivacity
itself
her
face
always
smiling
her
laugh
always
ready
as
the
evening
went
on
a
flush
made
its
appearance
on
her
cheeks
as
though
the
mental
stimulus
under
which
that
gaiety
was
produced
involved
a
veritable
quickening
of
the
pulses
and
her
son
when
he
met
her
in
the
hall
after
she
had
uncloaked
for
their
second
party
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
his
mother
look
as
he
expressed
it
must
look
out
for
loring
he
said
eagerly
there
he
is
mother
just
inside
the
doorway
that
fellow
do
you
see
with
a
yellow
buttonhole
it
was
easier
to
recognise
an
acquaintance
than
to
approach
within
speaking
distance
of
him
and
some
time
elapsed
during
which
romayne
and
julian
exchanged
greetings
on
all
sides
and
were
received
by
lady
bracondale
before
they
found
themselves
also
just
inside
the
doorway
romayne
had
given
one
quick
keen
glance
in
the
direction
indicated
by
julian
and
then
had
become
apparently
oblivious
of
marston
existence
until
julian
finally
exclaimed
met
loring
awfully
pleased
to
see
you
mother
may
i
introduce
marston
loring
she
turned
her
head
then
and
bent
it
very
graciously
holding
out
her
hand
with
her
most
charming
smile
have
known
you
by
sight
for
a
long
time
loring
she
said
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
delight
is
mine
was
the
response
spoken
with
just
that
touch
of
deference
which
is
never
so
attractive
to
a
woman
as
when
it
is
exhibited
in
conjunction
with
such
a
personality
as
is
one
for
which
i
have
wished
for
a
long
time
the
papers
interposed
julian
eagerly
lost
nottingham
you
see
he
was
alluding
to
a
which
had
led
to
the
political
discussion
of
the
evening
before
and
loring
nodded
see
said
loring
has
told
you
no
doubt
he
went
on
turning
to
romayne
we
foregathered
to
a
considerable
extent
last
night
over
politics
and
other
the
last
words
were
spoken
with
a
glance
at
the
younger
man
which
seemed
to
ascribe
to
their
acquaintance
an
altogether
more
personal
and
friendly
footing
than
political
discussion
alone
could
have
afforded
it
and
romayne
laughed
very
graciously
he
has
told
me
she
said
am
rather
thinking
of
getting
a
little
jealous
of
you
a
few
more
talk
followed
talk
in
which
loring
bore
himself
with
his
usual
cynical
manner
just
tempered
into
even
unusual
effectiveness
and
then
romayne
prepared
to
move
on
must
come
and
see
us
she
said
to
loring
will
give
you
the
address
i
am
at
home
on
fridays
and
i
hope
you
will
dine
with
us
before
long
she
gave
him
a
pretty
nod
and
an
and
turned
away
awfully
jolly
he
mother
exclaimed
julian
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
earshot
good
style
returned
romayne
approvingly
is
just
the
kind
of
man
to
get
on
you
have
a
good
deal
of
discrimination
sir
she
added
the
mother
and
son
were
separated
after
that
and
about
half
an
hour
later
romayne
caught
sight
of
julian
disappearing
with
a
very
pretty
girl
whose
face
she
did
not
know
in
the
direction
of
the
just
as
she
herself
was
greeted
by
lord
garstin
and
pressed
to
repair
thither
no
she
said
lightly
is
such
a
crowd
and
i
really
want
she
paused
that
accentuated
vivacity
was
still
about
her
as
she
looked
up
at
lord
garstin
with
a
little
smile
and
a
gesture
which
he
thought
unusually
charming
want
a
little
chat
with
you
though
very
much
she
said
with
pretty
confidence
going
to
ask
you
to
give
me
some
advice
do
you
know
will
it
bore
you
frightfully
the
contrary
it
will
delight
me
was
the
ready
and
by
no
means
insincere
response
romayne
made
a
gracious
and
grateful
movement
of
her
head
would
rather
take
your
opinion
than
that
of
any
other
man
i
know
she
said
confidentially
she
stopped
and
laughed
slightly
about
my
boy
of
course
she
said
want
to
know
what
you
think
of
a
club
for
a
young
man
in
his
position
do
you
think
now
that
it
is
a
good
thing
yes
returned
lord
garstin
consider
a
good
club
of
the
first
importance
to
a
young
man
your
young
man
ought
to
be
a
member
of
the
he
paused
a
moment
looking
at
her
as
she
nodded
her
head
softly
waiting
as
though
for
further
words
of
wisdom
from
him
and
thought
what
a
delightful
little
woman
she
was
i
talk
to
him
about
it
he
said
pleasantly
will
see
to
it
with
pleasure
if
you
would
like
nothing
certainly
could
have
been
more
delightful
than
manner
as
she
spoke
just
the
right
words
of
graceful
acknowledgement
and
acceptance
then
she
made
a
gaily
disparaging
comment
on
club
life
and
lord
advocacy
of
it
and
a
few
bantering
laughing
repartee
followed
that
society
repartee
of
which
romayne
was
a
mistress
from
thence
she
drifted
into
talk
about
the
party
and
a
complaint
of
the
heat
of
the
room
is
time
we
were
going
i
think
she
remarked
with
a
gay
little
laugh
a
mother
is
a
miserable
slave
you
see
i
am
until
called
for
i
suppose
i
were
not
absolutely
obliged
to
go
myself
returned
lord
garstin
encourage
such
a
suggestion
on
your
part
but
as
that
is
the
case
unfortunately
shall
i
find
your
boy
first
and
send
him
to
you
romayne
shook
her
head
with
another
laugh
saw
him
retire
to
the
a
little
while
ago
with
a
very
pretty
girl
she
said
make
it
a
point
never
to
hurry
him
under
such
circumstances
but
if
you
should
meet
him
you
might
tell
him
that
i
am
quite
ready
when
he
is
good
night
the
room
was
not
by
any
means
crowded
now
it
was
getting
late
and
a
great
many
people
were
in
the
the
corner
of
the
room
in
which
romayne
was
standing
happened
to
be
nearly
deserted
there
was
no
one
near
her
and
after
lord
garstin
left
her
she
stood
still
fanning
herself
and
looking
straight
before
her
with
her
bright
smile
and
animated
expression
rather
stereotyped
on
her
face
suddenly
as
if
involuntarily
she
turned
her
head
she
looked
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
met
the
eyes
of
a
man
standing
against
the
wall
who
had
been
looking
fixedly
at
her
ever
since
lord
garstin
joined
her
for
an
instant
not
the
slightest
perceptible
change
of
expression
touched
her
face
only
the
very
absoluteness
of
its
immobility
suggested
that
that
immobility
was
the
result
of
a
sudden
and
tremendous
effort
of
then
the
colour
faded
slowly
from
her
cheeks
and
from
her
lips
the
smile
did
not
disappear
but
it
gradually
assumed
a
ghastly
appearance
of
being
carved
in
marble
her
eyes
widened
slightly
and
became
strangely
fixed
the
man
was
dennis
falconer
and
he
and
she
were
looking
at
one
another
across
the
gulf
of
eighteen
years
it
was
only
for
a
moment
then
romayne
still
quite
colourless
lifted
her
eyebrows
prettily
and
made
a
gesture
of
amazed
recognition
and
falconer
moved
and
came
slowly
towards
her
a
surprising
thing
she
exclaimed
holding
out
her
hand
had
no
idea
you
were
here
how
do
you
do
welcome
home
her
tone
was
perfectly
easy
and
gracious
so
indeed
that
it
deprived
her
words
of
any
personal
or
emotional
significance
whatever
and
relegated
their
with
subtle
skill
to
the
most
conventional
of
society
grounds
the
rather
man
with
the
good
reserved
manner
who
stood
before
her
accepted
the
position
with
grave
readiness
you
he
said
he
spoke
with
distant
courtesy
about
which
there
was
not
even
the
suggestion
of
that
friendliness
as
of
distant
kinship
which
had
made
her
reception
of
him
nearly
perfect
as
a
work
of
art
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
be
in
england
have
been
away
let
me
see
two
years
said
romayne
with
the
vivacious
assumption
of
intelligent
interest
which
the
social
situation
demanded
is
it
really
and
you
have
done
wonderful
things
i
hear
funnily
enough
i
have
been
hearing
about
you
only
i
must
congratulate
he
bent
his
head
with
a
courteous
gesture
of
thanks
have
had
my
note
i
hope
he
said
are
settled
in
london
now
thomson
tells
thomson
was
the
family
lawyer
and
he
and
dennis
falconer
himself
were
trustees
under
old
will
yes
she
answered
suavely
had
it
just
before
lunch
so
nice
of
you
to
write
to
me
yes
we
are
settled
she
had
been
fanning
herself
carelessly
throughout
the
short
colloquy
glancing
at
falconer
or
about
the
room
with
every
appearance
of
perfect
ease
but
now
as
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
something
seemed
to
catch
her
attention
she
hesitated
appeared
to
forget
what
she
had
intended
to
say
tried
to
recover
herself
and
failed
julian
had
come
into
the
room
and
was
just
parting
gaily
from
some
one
in
the
doorway
dennis
falconer
did
not
take
up
her
unfinished
sentence
he
followed
the
direction
of
her
eyes
across
the
room
until
his
own
rested
upon
julian
and
then
he
started
slightly
and
glanced
down
at
the
woman
by
his
side
romayne
laughed
a
rather
high
unnatural
laugh
she
faced
him
with
her
eyes
very
hard
and
bright
and
her
lips
smiling
and
through
all
the
artificiality
of
her
face
and
manner
there
was
something
lurking
in
those
hard
bright
eyes
as
she
did
it
something
not
to
be
caught
or
defined
which
made
the
movement
almost
heroic
recognise
him
she
said
lightly
like
me
he
at
that
moment
julian
started
across
the
room
evidently
to
come
to
his
mother
he
came
on
stopping
incessantly
to
exchange
laughing
bowing
and
smiling
and
as
though
there
were
a
fascination
for
them
about
his
gay
young
figure
the
man
and
woman
standing
together
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
watched
him
draw
nearer
and
nearer
words
continued
to
come
from
romayne
a
pretty
inconsequent
flow
of
society
chatter
but
it
no
more
tempered
the
strange
gaze
with
which
her
eyes
followed
her
son
than
did
the
unheeding
silence
with
which
falconer
received
them
as
his
grave
eyes
rested
also
on
the
young
man
the
whole
thing
was
so
incongruous
the
expression
of
those
two
pair
of
eyes
was
so
utterly
out
of
harmony
with
their
surroundings
and
with
the
laughing
unconscious
boy
on
whom
they
were
fixed
that
they
seemed
to
draw
him
out
from
the
brightly
dressed
smiling
groups
through
which
he
passed
and
isolate
him
strangely
in
a
weird
atmosphere
of
his
own
you
are
sir
cried
his
mother
gaily
looking
no
longer
at
julian
as
he
stood
close
to
her
at
last
but
beyond
him
garstin
told
me
you
were
ready
to
go
dear
said
julian
pleasantly
hope
i
kept
you
was
no
hurry
she
answered
smiling
her
voice
was
a
little
thin
and
strained
will
go
now
i
think
but
i
want
to
introduce
you
first
to
some
one
whose
name
you
know
this
is
your
cousin
dennis
chapter
xi
it
was
a
rather
close
afternoon
in
the
third
week
of
may
fine
weather
had
lasted
without
a
break
for
more
than
a
fortnight
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
there
had
been
little
or
no
breeze
and
the
inevitable
effect
had
been
produced
upon
london
the
streets
were
a
combination
of
dust
which
defied
the
and
glare
which
seemed
to
radiate
alike
from
the
heavy
sky
the
houses
and
the
pavements
it
was
only
three
and
piccadilly
was
as
yet
far
from
being
crowded
the
pavement
was
mainly
occupied
by
the
working
population
which
hurries
to
and
fro
along
the
london
streets
from
morning
to
night
regardless
of
fashionable
hours
and
the
few
representatives
of
the
class
women
and
carefully
and
sauntering
men
stood
out
with
peculiar
distinctness
but
the
figure
of
dennis
falconer
as
he
walked
westward
along
the
north
side
of
piccadilly
was
conspicuous
not
only
on
these
rather
unenviable
terms
at
the
first
glance
it
would
have
seemed
that
the
past
eighteen
years
had
altered
him
considerably
and
altered
him
always
for
the
better
analysed
carefully
the
alteration
resolved
itself
into
a
very
noticeable
increase
of
maturity
and
of
a
certain
kind
of
strength
and
the
improvement
into
the
fact
that
his
weak
points
were
of
a
kind
to
be
far
less
perceptible
as
such
on
a
mature
than
on
an
immature
face
his
face
was
thin
and
very
brown
there
were
worn
lines
about
it
which
told
of
physical
endurance
and
in
the
sharper
chiselling
of
the
whole
the
thinness
of
the
nose
and
the
narrowness
of
the
forehead
were
no
longer
striking
the
somewhat
superiority
of
his
younger
days
had
disappeared
under
the
hand
of
time
and
a
certain
sternness
which
had
replaced
it
seemed
to
give
dignity
to
his
expression
the
keen
steadiness
of
his
eyes
had
strengthened
and
indeed
it
was
their
expression
which
helped
in
a
very
great
degree
to
make
his
face
so
noticeable
he
no
longer
wore
a
beard
and
the
firm
square
outline
of
his
chin
and
jaw
were
visible
while
his
mouth
was
hidden
by
a
moustache
like
his
hair
he
was
very
well
dressed
but
there
was
that
about
the
simple
conventionality
of
his
attire
which
suggested
that
its
correctness
was
rather
a
concession
to
exterior
demands
than
the
expression
of
personal
weakness
more
than
one
of
the
people
who
turned
their
heads
to
look
at
him
as
he
walked
down
piccadilly
were
familiar
with
that
grave
stern
face
it
had
been
reproduced
lately
in
the
pages
of
all
the
illustrated
papers
and
people
glanced
at
it
with
the
interest
created
by
the
appearance
in
the
flesh
of
something
of
a
celebrity
falconer
had
done
a
great
deal
of
good
work
for
the
geographical
society
in
the
course
of
the
past
eighteen
years
work
characterised
by
no
brilliancy
or
originality
of
intellectual
resource
but
eminently
persevering
conscientious
and
patient
during
the
last
year
however
a
chapter
of
accidents
had
conspired
to
invest
the
expedition
of
which
he
was
the
leader
with
a
touch
of
romance
and
excitement
with
which
his
personality
would
never
have
endued
it
the
achievement
in
which
the
expedition
had
resulted
had
been
hailed
in
england
as
a
national
triumph
and
dennis
falconer
found
himself
one
of
the
lions
of
the
moment
but
the
position
especially
for
a
man
who
believed
himself
to
attach
no
value
whatever
to
it
had
been
somewhat
dearly
bought
falconer
as
he
walked
the
london
streets
on
that
may
afternoon
was
trying
to
realise
himself
as
at
home
in
them
settled
among
them
perhaps
for
an
indefinite
period
and
the
effort
brought
an
added
shade
of
gravity
to
his
face
the
terrible
physical
strain
of
the
last
six
months
a
strain
the
severity
of
which
he
had
hardly
realised
at
the
time
as
he
endured
from
day
to
day
with
the
simple
unimaginative
perseverance
of
a
man
for
whom
nerves
have
no
existence
had
told
even
upon
his
iron
constitution
and
a
couple
of
great
london
doctors
had
condemned
him
to
a
inactivity
at
least
under
penalties
too
grave
to
be
provoked
he
turned
down
sloane
street
and
another
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
him
to
number
queen
anne
street
he
rang
was
admitted
and
ushered
upstairs
into
the
the
room
was
empty
and
falconer
walked
across
it
glancing
about
him
with
those
keen
habitually
observant
eyes
of
his
and
on
his
face
there
was
something
of
the
stiffness
and
reserve
which
had
characterised
his
voice
a
minute
earlier
as
he
asked
for
romayne
until
the
night
now
nearly
a
fortnight
ago
when
they
had
met
in
lady
dennis
falconer
had
seen
romayne
only
once
since
their
journey
from
nice
had
ended
in
old
house
that
one
occasion
had
been
his
visit
to
his
uncle
so
called
in
his
swiss
home
in
the
second
year
of
widowhood
he
had
been
in
europe
several
times
since
then
and
had
always
made
a
point
of
visiting
old
falconer
but
on
every
subsequent
occasion
it
had
happened
rather
strangely
as
he
had
thought
to
himself
once
or
twice
that
romayne
was
away
from
home
after
old
death
communication
between
them
occurred
only
at
the
rarest
intervals
dennis
falconer
was
only
remaining
relation
and
in
this
capacity
had
been
left
by
her
uncle
one
of
her
trustees
but
any
necessary
business
was
transacted
by
his
fellow
trustee
old
lawyer
but
the
clan
instinct
was
very
strong
in
falconer
it
brought
in
its
wake
a
whole
set
of
duties
and
obligations
which
for
most
men
are
and
the
sense
of
duty
which
had
been
characteristic
of
him
in
early
manhood
had
only
been
more
deeply
and
narrowly
engraved
by
every
succeeding
year
arrived
in
london
and
knowing
romayne
to
be
settled
there
he
had
considered
it
incumbent
on
him
to
call
on
her
and
had
written
the
note
which
she
had
received
nearly
a
fortnight
ago
he
had
written
it
with
much
the
same
expression
on
his
face
only
a
little
less
pronounced
perhaps
as
rested
on
it
now
that
he
was
waiting
for
romayne
in
her
own
through
all
the
changes
brought
about
by
the
passing
of
eighteen
years
the
mental
attitude
produced
in
him
towards
romayne
during
those
weeks
of
dual
solitude
at
nice
had
remained
almost
untouched
except
inasmuch
as
its
disapproval
had
been
accentuated
by
everything
he
had
heard
of
her
since
it
had
been
vivified
and
rendered
as
it
were
tangible
and
definite
by
the
short
interview
at
lady
party
which
had
made
her
a
reality
instead
of
a
remembrance
to
him
he
was
standing
before
a
large
and
very
admirable
photograph
of
julian
julian
at
his
very
best
and
most
attractive
contemplating
it
with
a
heavy
frown
when
the
door
behind
him
opened
under
a
light
quick
touch
and
romayne
came
into
the
room
is
too
shocking
to
have
kept
you
waiting
she
said
glad
to
see
you
i
gave
myself
too
much
shopping
to
do
and
i
have
had
quite
a
fearful
rush
her
voice
and
manner
were
very
easy
very
conventionally
cordial
and
as
it
seemed
to
falconer
there
was
not
a
natural
tone
or
movement
about
her
it
was
her
afternoon
and
she
was
charmingly
dressed
in
something
soft
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
the
play
of
expression
on
her
face
was
even
more
vivacious
and
effective
than
usual
exaggeratedly
so
even
she
shook
hands
and
pointed
him
to
a
seat
sinking
into
a
chair
herself
with
an
affectation
of
victory
over
the
the
subtle
assumption
of
the
most
superficial
society
relation
as
alone
existing
between
them
was
as
insidious
and
as
indefinable
as
it
had
been
on
their
previous
meeting
and
seemed
to
set
the
of
the
situation
even
before
she
spoke
again
is
a
frightful
season
she
said
horribly
busy
they
say
it
is
to
be
a
short
one
i
am
sure
i
trust
it
is
true
if
we
are
any
of
us
to
be
left
alive
at
the
end
and
everything
seems
to
be
crammed
into
a
few
weeks
you
think
so
you
are
very
lucky
to
have
arrived
just
now
does
not
seem
to
be
a
particularly
desirable
place
certainly
answered
falconer
his
manner
was
very
formal
and
reserved
a
great
contrast
to
her
apparent
ease
she
said
lifting
her
eyebrows
with
a
smile
that
sounds
rather
ungrateful
in
you
do
you
know
for
london
finds
you
a
very
desirable
visitor
one
hears
of
you
am
afraid
i
must
confess
that
i
take
very
little
pleasure
in
going
returned
falconer
stiffly
life
in
london
seems
to
me
to
have
altered
for
the
worse
in
every
direction
since
i
last
took
part
in
yet
you
go
out
a
great
deal
with
a
laugh
sounds
a
trifle
inconsistent
am
not
sufficiently
egotistical
to
imagine
that
my
individual
refusal
to
countenance
it
would
have
any
effect
upon
society
answered
falconer
still
more
stiffly
tolerate
is
by
no
means
to
reasons
for
the
toleration
in
question
the
real
reasons
of
which
he
himself
was
wholly
unconscious
would
have
astonished
him
not
a
little
if
he
could
have
brought
himself
to
realise
them
in
their
narrow
conventionality
fortunately
it
did
not
occur
to
romayne
to
ask
for
them
with
the
ready
tact
of
a
woman
of
the
world
she
turned
the
conversation
with
a
gracefully
worded
question
as
to
his
recent
expedition
he
answered
it
with
the
courteous
generality
only
rather
more
gravely
spoken
with
which
he
had
answered
a
great
many
similar
questions
put
to
him
during
the
past
week
by
ladies
to
whom
he
had
been
introduced
in
his
capacity
of
momentary
celebrity
and
she
passed
on
from
one
point
to
another
with
the
superficial
interest
evoked
by
one
of
the
topics
of
the
hour
her
exaggerated
comments
and
questions
more
or
less
wide
of
the
mark
were
exhausted
at
length
and
a
pause
followed
a
fact
that
indicated
though
falconer
did
not
know
it
that
the
preceding
conversation
had
involved
some
kind
of
strain
on
the
bright
little
woman
who
had
kept
it
up
so
vivaciously
the
pause
was
broken
by
falconer
have
heard
he
said
poor
illness
it
would
hardly
be
true
to
say
that
romayne
started
even
slightly
but
a
curious
kind
of
flush
seemed
to
pass
across
her
face
as
she
answered
both
her
voice
and
her
manner
seemed
instinctively
to
increase
and
emphasize
that
distance
which
she
had
tacitly
set
between
them
it
was
as
though
the
introduction
into
the
conversation
of
a
name
their
mutual
familiarity
with
which
represented
mutual
interests
and
connections
had
created
the
instinct
in
her
poor
man
she
said
carelessly
has
been
a
good
deal
of
illness
about
this
season
am
afraid
it
is
a
bad
business
went
on
falconer
with
no
comprehension
of
the
turn
she
had
given
to
the
conversation
and
with
his
mental
condemnation
of
what
seemed
to
him
simple
heartlessness
on
her
part
not
wholly
absent
from
his
voice
was
to
be
a
consultation
and
i
shall
call
this
evening
to
hear
the
result
but
i
am
afraid
there
is
very
slender
very
sad
said
romayne
with
polite
interest
falconer
bent
his
head
in
grave
assent
and
then
with
a
view
to
arousing
in
her
shallow
nature
as
it
seemed
to
him
some
remembrance
at
least
of
the
usefulness
to
her
of
the
man
whose
probable
death
she
contemplated
so
carelessly
he
said
with
formal
courtesy
has
done
all
the
work
connected
with
our
joint
trusteeship
so
admirably
hitherto
that
there
has
been
no
need
for
my
services
but
if
while
he
is
ill
you
should
find
yourself
in
want
of
his
aid
in
that
capacity
i
need
not
say
that
i
am
entirely
at
your
again
that
curious
flush
passed
across
face
leaving
it
rather
pale
this
time
so
much
she
said
quickly
really
could
not
think
of
troubling
you
no
doubt
i
shall
be
able
to
hold
on
until
thomson
is
well
again
thanks
immensely
you
will
not
be
within
reach
for
very
long
i
suppose
shall
be
in
london
for
a
year
certainly
answered
falconer
acknowledging
her
tacit
refusal
to
recognise
any
claim
on
him
in
the
formal
directness
of
his
reply
then
as
she
uttered
a
sharp
little
exclamation
of
surprise
he
added
briefly
am
in
the
hands
unfortunately
there
is
something
wrong
with
me
they
am
very
sorry
she
began
prettily
though
her
eyes
were
rather
hard
and
preoccupied
but
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
to
admit
an
influx
of
visitors
and
falconer
rose
to
go
glad
to
have
seen
you
she
said
as
she
turned
to
him
after
welcoming
the
have
a
cup
of
tea
it
is
always
rather
crushing
when
a
man
refuses
tea
it
anson
turning
as
she
spoke
to
a
lady
sitting
close
by
then
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
speaking
in
a
tone
which
still
included
the
other
lady
in
the
conversation
she
alluded
for
the
first
time
to
julian
the
whole
call
had
gone
by
without
one
of
those
references
to
with
which
all
acquaintances
were
so
familiar
that
such
an
omission
under
the
circumstances
would
have
been
hardly
credible
to
any
one
of
them
so
sorry
you
have
missed
my
boy
she
said
now
with
her
apologetic
laugh
afraid
i
am
absurdly
proud
of
him
that
so
dear
mrs
anson
but
he
really
is
a
dear
is
going
to
the
bar
i
believe
said
falconer
his
face
and
voice
alike
were
uncompromisingly
stern
and
unbending
answered
mother
is
not
clever
dear
boy
but
i
hope
he
may
do
fairly
well
shall
you
be
at
the
we
are
going
first
to
see
the
american
actor
they
rave
about
so
a
funny
little
domestic
party
i
and
my
son
and
my
new
and
particular
face
did
not
regain
its
normal
colour
as
she
turned
her
attention
to
her
other
callers
nor
did
those
faint
lines
about
her
mouth
and
eyes
disappear
she
was
particularly
charming
that
afternoon
but
always
as
she
welcomed
one
set
of
visitors
or
parted
from
another
laughing
talking
or
listening
so
gaily
there
was
a
faint
hardly
definable
air
of
preoccupation
about
her
she
had
a
great
many
visitors
and
the
afternoon
grew
hotter
as
it
wore
on
when
she
dressed
for
dinner
that
night
finding
herself
strangely
nervous
irritable
with
her
maid
and
edge
altogether
as
she
expressed
it
she
was
very
definite
and
distinct
in
her
that
such
an
unusual
state
of
things
was
owing
solely
to
the
heat
and
tiresome
rather
unnecessarily
distinct
and
explicit
it
would
have
seemed
since
there
was
apparently
no
chance
of
contradiction
the
acquaintanceship
between
julian
and
marston
loring
had
developed
during
the
past
fortnight
with
surprising
rapidity
they
had
dined
together
at
the
club
they
had
smoked
together
in
chambers
and
they
had
met
incessantly
at
dances
homes
or
dinners
on
all
of
which
occasions
romayne
had
been
uniformly
gracious
to
her
friend
at
a
a
few
miles
out
of
london
admittedly
the
greatest
failure
of
the
season
when
loring
and
the
romaynes
had
walked
about
together
all
the
afternoon
with
that
carelessness
of
social
obligations
which
a
dull
party
is
apt
to
engender
the
scheme
for
the
present
evening
had
been
arranged
loring
adding
a
preliminary
dinner
at
a
restaurant
with
himself
in
the
capacity
of
host
to
romayne
and
her
son
to
the
original
suggestion
that
they
should
go
together
to
the
theatre
julian
was
in
high
spirits
as
they
drove
off
to
keep
their
engagement
but
his
responses
to
his
chatter
were
neither
so
ready
nor
so
bright
as
usual
he
glanced
at
her
once
or
twice
and
then
said
boyishly
look
awfully
done
up
mother
romayne
turned
to
him
quickly
her
eyes
sparkling
angrily
her
whole
face
looking
irritable
and
annoyed
dear
julian
she
said
sharply
a
very
bad
habit
to
be
constantly
commenting
on
appearance
especially
when
your
remarks
are
uncomplimentary
you
told
me
i
looked
tired
the
other
day
please
do
it
again
such
an
ebullition
of
temper
was
an
almost
thing
with
romayne
and
julian
could
only
stare
at
her
in
helpless
astonishment
not
hurt
but
simply
surprised
and
inclined
to
be
resentful
he
could
not
realise
as
a
woman
might
have
done
the
jarred
quivering
state
of
nerves
implied
in
such
an
outbreak
and
he
simply
thought
his
mother
was
rather
odd
when
a
moment
later
she
stretched
out
her
hand
hastily
and
laid
it
on
his
with
a
quick
tight
squeeze
was
abominably
cross
dear
she
said
in
a
voice
which
shook
mind
i
am
all
right
but
she
was
not
all
right
and
though
she
made
a
valiant
effort
to
collect
her
forces
and
appear
so
her
gaiety
throughout
dinner
was
strained
and
forced
quick
perception
realised
instantly
that
something
was
wrong
with
her
and
his
demeanour
under
the
circumstances
was
significant
at
once
of
the
work
of
the
past
fortnight
and
of
his
individual
capacity
for
turning
everything
to
his
own
ends
with
a
tacit
assumption
of
a
certain
right
to
consider
her
he
evinced
just
such
a
delicate
appreciation
of
her
mood
as
gave
her
a
sense
of
rest
and
soothing
without
letting
her
feel
for
a
moment
that
he
found
anything
wanting
in
her
his
pose
was
always
that
of
a
man
to
whom
youth
or
even
early
manhood
with
its
follies
and
inexperiences
is
a
thing
of
the
dim
past
and
he
used
that
pose
now
to
the
utmost
advantage
combining
a
mental
equality
with
the
mother
with
an
actual
equality
with
the
son
as
his
contemporary
in
a
manner
which
made
him
seem
in
a
very
subtle
way
equally
the
friend
of
each
he
talked
of
course
almost
exclusively
to
romayne
never
however
failing
to
include
julian
in
the
conversation
and
he
so
managed
the
conversation
as
to
take
all
its
trouble
on
his
own
shoulders
and
give
romayne
little
to
do
but
listen
and
be
entertained
he
succeeded
so
well
that
the
by
the
time
it
was
over
had
done
the
work
of
many
days
in
advancing
his
dawning
intimacy
with
romayne
she
felt
better
she
told
herself
as
they
entered
the
theatre
told
herself
with
rather
excessive
eagerness
and
satisfaction
perhaps
because
of
something
within
of
which
the
quick
nervous
movement
of
her
hands
as
she
unfastened
her
cloak
was
the
outward
and
visible
sign
the
curtain
was
just
going
up
as
they
seated
themselves
and
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
the
two
seats
to
their
left
remained
empty
then
romayne
whose
attention
was
by
no
means
chained
to
the
stage
became
aware
of
the
slow
and
difficult
approach
of
a
flow
of
and
apologetic
conversation
combined
with
the
large
person
of
a
lady
and
a
moment
or
two
later
she
was
being
fallen
over
by
halse
who
was
followed
by
a
girl
and
who
continued
to
explain
the
situation
fluently
and
audibly
until
a
distinct
expression
of
the
opinion
of
the
pit
caused
her
to
subside
temporarily
she
began
to
talk
again
before
the
applause
on
the
fall
of
the
curtain
had
died
away
and
her
voice
reached
romayne
to
whom
her
remarks
were
addressed
across
the
girl
who
was
with
her
and
julian
who
was
sitting
on
his
left
hand
with
gradually
increasing
distinctness
curious
that
our
seats
should
be
together
were
the
first
words
romayne
heard
have
just
been
meeting
a
connection
of
yours
the
explorer
you
know
dennis
falconer
so
fascinating
oh
my
cousin
i
think
she
has
had
the
pleasure
of
being
introduced
to
you
though
she
has
met
your
son
miss
hilda
newton
miss
hilda
newton
was
a
very
pretty
dark
girl
of
a
somewhat
pronounced
type
she
had
large
perceptive
black
eyes
singularly
unabashed
a
charming
little
nose
and
a
rather
large
mouth
with
a
good
deal
of
shrewd
character
about
it
she
was
understood
to
be
a
country
cousin
of
with
whom
she
had
been
staying
for
the
last
three
weeks
but
only
a
very
critical
and
rather
unkind
eye
could
have
traced
the
country
cousin
in
her
dress
which
had
a
great
deal
of
style
and
dash
about
it
she
acknowledged
introduction
of
her
with
rather
excessive
and
after
a
casual
word
or
two
to
romayne
addressed
herself
to
julian
it
was
she
with
whom
he
had
disappeared
to
supper
at
lady
home
and
they
had
evidently
seen
a
good
deal
of
one
another
in
the
interval
romayne
had
noticed
them
together
more
than
once
and
she
had
taken
a
dislike
to
miss
pretty
independent
face
and
manners
in
her
present
mood
it
was
an
absolute
relief
to
her
to
find
in
the
girl
a
legitimate
excuse
for
irritation
and
a
reason
for
the
fact
that
speech
had
somehow
undone
all
the
work
of
the
early
part
of
the
evening
and
set
her
nerves
on
edge
afresh
bad
style
she
said
to
herself
angrily
giving
an
unheeding
ear
to
halse
as
she
watched
miss
newton
reply
with
a
little
twirl
of
her
fan
to
an
eager
question
of
what
one
would
expect
in
a
cousin
of
that
then
she
became
aware
that
was
vociferously
insisting
on
changing
places
with
julian
and
that
julian
was
acceding
to
the
proposition
with
considerable
alacrity
and
before
she
had
well
realised
exactly
what
the
change
involved
halse
with
much
paraphernalia
of
fan
and
programme
was
established
at
her
side
and
julian
and
miss
newton
were
seated
together
at
the
end
of
the
row
practically
isolated
by
the
stream
of
conversation
horrid
to
talk
across
people
it
said
that
lady
airily
though
no
crowd
ever
collected
would
have
interfered
with
her
flow
of
language
is
much
more
comfortable
my
dear
romayne
i
am
simply
dying
to
rave
to
somebody
about
your
cousin
he
is
your
cousin
he
mr
falconer
you
know
what
a
splendid
man
of
course
all
the
accounts
of
his
work
have
been
most
fascinating
but
the
man
himself
makes
it
all
seem
so
much
more
real
you
know
now
do
tell
me
is
he
your
first
cousin
and
do
you
remember
him
when
he
was
quite
a
little
boy
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
romayne
took
up
her
fan
and
unfurled
it
she
was
looking
past
halse
at
julian
and
miss
newton
who
were
looking
over
the
same
programme
with
their
heads
rather
close
together
her
eyebrows
were
slightly
contracted
and
her
eyes
very
bright
and
the
restless
movements
of
the
slender
hand
that
held
the
fan
seemed
to
be
an
expression
of
intense
inward
irritation
dear
no
dennis
falconer
is
not
my
first
cousin
by
any
means
she
said
carelessly
though
her
voice
was
a
trifle
sharp
or
fourth
or
something
of
that
is
quite
a
hero
he
said
halse
gushingly
addressing
loring
you
met
him
loring
though
his
glance
had
every
appearance
of
perfect
carelessness
was
watching
romayne
intently
he
had
noticed
her
access
of
nervous
irritability
and
he
was
curious
as
to
the
cause
was
it
her
flirtation
with
miss
newton
was
it
dislike
to
halse
or
had
it
any
connection
with
dennis
falconer
he
had
his
reasons
for
a
study
of
idiosyncrasies
he
said
met
him
the
other
night
a
good
sort
of
fellow
he
magnificent
said
halse
enthusiastically
must
have
him
at
the
bazaar
my
dear
romayne
that
i
am
quite
determined
if
he
would
sell
african
trophies
for
us
you
know
a
tooth
or
oh
is
it
well
anything
of
that
sort
it
would
be
a
fortune
to
us
have
you
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
cousins
are
so
often
just
like
brothers
and
sisters
are
they
not
a
low
laugh
and
a
toss
of
her
head
from
miss
newton
at
this
moment
closed
the
perusal
of
the
programme
and
julian
turned
his
attention
to
perusing
the
pretty
black
eyes
instead
lips
seemed
to
tighten
and
whiten
and
the
fingers
which
held
the
fan
were
tightly
clenched
as
she
answered
in
a
voice
which
rang
hard
in
spite
of
her
efforts
they
are
of
course
but
it
depends
so
much
on
circumstances
dennis
falconer
and
i
had
not
met
for
years
until
the
other
at
that
moment
the
curtain
went
up
leaving
halse
literally
with
her
mouth
open
and
the
instant
it
fell
romayne
leant
across
to
miss
newton
with
a
comment
on
the
performance
spoken
in
a
rather
thin
tense
voice
and
with
eyes
that
glittered
as
though
the
nervous
strain
under
which
the
speaker
was
labouring
was
becoming
almost
insupportable
apparently
something
in
her
face
repelled
the
girl
for
her
answer
was
of
the
briefest
and
julian
throwing
himself
into
the
breach
he
and
miss
newton
were
instantly
absorbed
in
an
animated
discussion
it
was
a
long
wait
and
loring
noting
every
one
of
the
restless
movements
of
the
woman
by
his
side
as
she
talked
and
laughed
so
sharply
understood
that
to
romayne
every
moment
meant
nervous
torture
the
instant
the
green
curtain
fell
on
the
third
act
she
rose
and
loring
followed
her
example
and
wrapped
her
quickly
and
deftly
in
her
cloak
say
i
think
much
of
your
american
prodigy
she
said
to
him
with
a
forced
laugh
must
confess
that
he
has
bored
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
really
stand
any
more
boredom
and
shall
go
straight
home
julian
she
glanced
round
for
him
as
she
spoke
but
he
was
escorting
halse
and
her
cousin
and
she
was
waiting
for
him
in
her
brougham
before
he
joined
her
you
come
to
the
club
with
me
suggested
loring
carelessly
as
julian
received
his
announcement
of
her
intentions
rather
blankly
do
you
say
to
a
game
of
billiards
right
responded
julian
old
fellow
it
was
only
that
i
told
miss
newton
we
were
coming
on
she
a
jolly
girl
mother
romayne
smiled
pretty
indeed
she
said
lightly
a
sad
pity
such
an
ineligible
fellow
it
and
loring
as
the
carriage
drove
off
said
to
himself
admiringly
a
wonderfully
clever
woman
reaction
from
a
heavy
strain
even
apparently
if
it
is
only
the
strain
of
combating
exhaustion
engendered
by
heat
is
a
terrible
thing
when
romayne
got
out
of
her
carriage
after
her
long
drive
her
face
was
haggard
and
drawn
she
passed
into
the
house
gathered
up
mechanically
and
without
a
glance
two
letters
waiting
for
her
on
the
told
the
maid
who
was
waiting
for
her
that
she
might
go
to
bed
and
went
up
into
the
there
was
a
low
chair
by
a
little
table
covered
with
dainty
useless
paraphernalia
which
she
particularly
affected
she
sat
down
in
it
now
almost
unconsciously
as
it
seemed
without
even
loosening
her
cloak
and
with
a
long
low
sigh
the
moments
passed
and
still
she
sat
there
a
curious
grey
pallor
about
her
face
her
eyes
gazing
straight
before
her
as
though
they
were
looking
into
the
future
or
the
past
at
last
as
if
by
a
sudden
fierce
effort
of
will
she
roused
herself
and
began
to
tear
open
the
letters
still
in
her
hand
as
if
with
a
desperate
instinct
towards
occupying
her
thoughts
her
eyes
fell
on
the
letter
by
this
time
open
in
her
hand
and
she
read
it
almost
unconsciously
taking
in
the
sense
gradually
as
she
read
cousin
hermia
have
just
heard
to
my
great
sorrow
of
the
death
of
our
old
friend
thomson
and
i
think
it
right
to
let
you
know
of
it
i
believe
i
need
not
remind
you
that
on
any
future
occasion
on
which
the
help
of
your
now
unfortunately
sole
trustee
may
be
necessary
you
will
find
me
entirely
at
your
service
yours
with
a
sudden
fierce
gesture
of
which
her
small
white
fingers
looked
hardly
capable
romayne
crushed
the
letter
in
her
hand
and
lifted
her
head
be
thrown
upon
him
she
said
in
a
curious
breathless
tone
have
to
come
into
contact
close

personal
contact

chapter
xii
the
season
as
romayne
had
told
dennis
falconer
was
to
be
a
short
one
and
its
proceedings
were
apparently
to
be
regulated
on
the
old
principle
of
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
gaieties
overtook
one
another
in
too
rapid
succession
and
an
unusually
sunny
and
breezy
may
and
june
with
the
inevitable
action
of
such
weather
on
human
beings
even
under
the
most
artificial
conditions
rendered
these
gaieties
a
shade
more
really
gay
than
usual
the
atmosphere
was
not
again
so
close
as
it
had
been
on
the
afternoon
when
dennis
falconer
called
on
romayne
and
it
is
presumable
that
the
weather
must
have
been
responsible
for
her
general
unusualness
of
mood
on
the
evening
of
that
day
for
if
she
was
not
quite
herself
on
the
following
morning
the
touch
of
in
her
brightness
was
so
slight
as
to
be
hardly
perceptible
and
a
day
or
two
later
it
had
entirely
disappeared
certainly
if
constant
stir
and
movement
are
conducive
to
good
spirits
there
was
nothing
wonderful
in
satisfaction
with
life
for
she
had
not
as
she
complained
laughingly
a
single
moment
to
herself
a
regular
treadmill
she
exclaimed
gaily
one
day
to
lord
garstin
had
really
forgotten
what
a
terrible
thing
a
london
season
was
seems
to
agree
with
you
was
the
answer
is
one
lady
of
my
acquaintance
and
only
one
who
seems
to
grow
younger
every
day
mean
me
she
laughed
assure
you
i
am
growing
grey
with
incessantly
running
after
that
boy
of
mine
he
is
as
difficult
to
catch
as
any
lion
of
the
season
i
never
see
him
except
at
parties
intimacy
with
marston
loring
had
grown
apace
and
it
had
led
to
sundry
social
consequences
which
were
his
mother
said
good
for
little
dinners
at
the
club
to
which
he
had
been
duly
elected
dinners
at
which
he
was
now
guest
now
host
jovial
little
bachelor
suppers
made
up
among
the
very
best
loring
himself
was
very
careful
though
he
knew
better
than
to
make
his
care
perceptible
except
in
its
results
never
to
allow
himself
to
be
placed
in
the
position
of
a
rival
to
romayne
for
her
time
and
company
he
lost
no
opportunity
of
making
himself
useful
and
agreeable
to
romayne
now
using
pleasantly
arrogated
rights
as
friend
now
his
superior
and
knowledge
of
the
world
until
he
gradually
assumed
the
position
of
friend
of
the
house
but
club
life
necessarily
created
in
julian
interests
apart
from
his
mother
interests
which
she
was
apparently
well
content
that
he
should
have
so
long
as
his
chatter
to
her
on
the
subject
revealed
that
they
were
all
connected
with
good
it
was
furthermore
a
season
of
very
pretty
a
large
majority
of
whom
elected
to
look
upon
romayne
as
a
nice
boy
and
to
exact
or
permit
any
amount
of
slavery
from
him
in
the
matters
of
fetching
and
carrying
and
general
attendance
known
to
be
so
profoundly
ineligible
you
see
his
mother
would
say
to
him
laughing
is
in
the
least
afraid
of
you
poor
boy
and
she
looked
on
with
perfect
calmness
as
he
danced
and
rode
and
did
church
parade
looked
on
with
a
calmness
which
might
have
been
mistaken
for
indifference
but
for
the
significant
fact
that
she
always
knew
which
of
his
was
in
the
ascendant
for
the
moment
miss
newton
had
gone
home
on
the
day
following
the
meeting
at
the
theatre
falconer
was
to
be
seen
about
throughout
the
season
making
his
grave
concession
to
the
weaknesses
of
society
romayne
and
julian
met
him
constantly
and
he
was
asked
to
and
attended
the
most
formal
of
the
dinners
given
at
queen
anne
street
but
the
intercourse
between
him
and
his
as
romayne
called
herself
was
of
the
most
distant
and
type
julian
did
not
take
to
him
at
all
is
such
a
solemn
fellow
mother
he
said
seems
to
think
that
doing
something
wrong
all
the
an
observation
to
which
romayne
replied
by
laughing
a
rather
forced
laugh
and
changing
the
conversation
the
last
event
of
the
season
as
it
became
evident
as
the
weeks
ran
on
would
be
the
bazaar
in
aid
of
discovery
among
charities
it
was
perhaps
as
well
that
the
institution
in
question
was
by
no
means
in
such
urgent
need
of
patronage
as
might
have
been
argued
from
demeanour
towards
it
earlier
in
the
proceedings
for
that
enthusiasm
on
the
subject
had
suffered
severely
in
the
contest
with
the
numerous
other
enthusiasms
which
had
succeeded
it
and
the
affairs
of
the
bazaar
had
been
pursued
by
all
its
supporters
with
energy
which
is
most
charitably
to
be
described
as
intermittent
three
separate
dates
had
been
fixed
for
the
opening
day
and
after
a
great
deal
of
money
had
been
spent
in
printing
and
advertising
each
of
these
in
succession
had
had
to
be
abandoned
owing
to
the
singular
incompleteness
of
every
fundamental
arrangement
though
as
halse
observed
impatiently
after
the
third
postponement
there
were
and
heaps
of
chinese
finally
it
was
announced
for
the
fifth
and
sixth
of
july
and
owing
to
herculean
efforts
on
the
part
of
unfortunate
men
enlisted
in
the
cause
who
apparently
braced
themselves
to
the
task
with
a
desperate
sense
that
if
the
affair
was
not
somehow
or
another
carried
through
now
by
fair
means
or
foul
they
were
doomed
to
struggle
in
a
tumultuous
sea
of
fashionable
feminine
futility
for
the
remainder
of
their
miserable
lives
on
the
fifth
the
bazaar
was
actually
opened
it
was
late
in
the
evening
of
that
eventful
day
and
in
various
fashionable
exhausted
ladies
stretched
on
sofas
were
recruiting
their
forces
after
their
severe
labours
it
had
been
the
fashion
for
the
last
week
or
more
among
the
prospective
to
allude
to
the
fatigue
before
them
with
resigned
and
heroic
sighs
of
awful
import
consequently
they
were
now
convinced
to
a
woman
that
they
were
in
the
last
stages
of
exhaustion
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
doubtful
whether
out
of
the
sensations
of
all
the
helpers
concerned
with
the
exception
of
the
devoted
before
mentioned
who
had
retired
to
various
clubs
in
a
state
of
collapse
a
decent
state
of
fatigue
could
have
been
constructed
and
the
reason
for
this
was
threefold
in
the
first
place
so
much
money
had
been
spent
in
announcing
the
dates
when
the
bazaar
did
not
take
place
that
there
was
exceedingly
little
forthcoming
to
announce
the
date
when
it
did
take
place
consequently
its
attractive
existence
remained
almost
unknown
to
the
general
public
and
the
services
of
the
sellers
were
in
very
slight
demand
in
the
second
place
the
greater
part
of
the
work
which
could
not
be
done
by
proxy
was
left
undone
and
in
the
third
place
each
lady
had
been
throughout
the
day
so
deeply
convinced
of
the
nature
of
her
occupation
that
she
thought
it
only
her
duty
to
whenever
that
course
was
open
to
her
which
was
almost
always
in
the
at
chelsea
very
cool
and
pretty
with
its
open
windows
and
its
plentiful
supply
of
flowers
and
ferns
romayne
was
lying
on
the
sofa
as
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
socially
speaking
demanded
of
her
in
an
attitude
of
graceful
weariness
an
attitude
which
was
rather
belied
by
the
alert
expression
of
her
contented
face
she
had
dined
at
home
a
quiet
little
dinner
you
know
cold
because
goodness
knows
when
we
shall
get
it
with
julian
and
loring
at
seven
the
bazaar
did
not
close
until
nine
but
all
the
principal
had
thought
it
their
duty
to
the
following
day
not
to
wear
themselves
quite
out
and
had
left
the
last
two
hours
to
the
care
of
one
or
other
of
the
of
whom
women
may
usually
have
a
supply
if
they
choose
and
quiet
little
dinner
was
only
one
of
a
score
of
similar
functions
very
dainty
and
luxurious
in
view
of
the
tremendous
exertions
which
had
preceded
them
which
were
being
held
in
various
fashionable
parts
of
london
at
ten
loring
had
taken
his
leave
declaring
sympathetically
that
romayne
must
long
for
perfect
quiet
after
her
exertions
it
was
then
that
romayne
had
betaken
herself
to
her
sofa
and
her
papers
an
immense
time
it
is
since
we
have
had
such
a
domesticated
hour
romayne
had
laid
down
her
literature
some
moments
before
and
had
been
lying
looking
at
julian
with
that
curious
expression
in
her
eyes
which
would
creep
into
them
now
and
again
when
they
rested
on
the
young
figure
and
which
harmonised
so
ill
with
the
shallow
vivacious
prettiness
of
the
rest
of
her
face
she
spoke
however
with
her
usual
light
laugh
at
herself
and
julian
laughed
too
as
he
threw
down
his
magazine
and
turned
towards
her
is
an
age
it
he
said
during
the
final
agony
of
preparation
for
the
bazaar
julian
had
been
in
immense
request
not
that
he
was
one
of
the
devoted
or
that
he
did
much
definite
work
but
he
was
always
ready
to
discuss
any
private
fad
with
her
for
any
length
of
time
and
to
rush
all
over
london
about
nothing
his
exertions
and
the
exhaustion
engendered
thereby
had
rendered
necessary
a
great
deal
of
recreation
at
the
club
he
had
repaired
thither
very
frequently
of
late
instead
of
escorting
his
mother
home
on
the
conclusion
of
their
tale
of
parties
for
the
night
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
it
is
so
nearly
over
observed
romayne
carelessly
it
is
never
worth
while
in
the
world
in
which
romayne
moved
to
express
more
than
half
your
meaning
in
words
and
julian
quite
understood
that
she
alluded
not
to
the
domestic
hour
but
to
the
season
her
words
were
not
prompted
by
any
actual
weariness
of
the
round
of
life
she
characterised
as
but
the
sentiment
was
in
the
air
the
fashionable
air
that
is
to
say
she
and
julian
in
common
with
the
greater
part
of
their
world
were
leaving
london
at
the
end
of
the
week
has
been
awfully
jolly
said
julian
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
resting
his
head
against
his
loosely
locked
hands
had
no
idea
that
life
was
such
a
business
his
mother
smiled
and
there
was
a
strange
touch
of
triumph
in
her
smile
is
a
business
she
assented
one
lives
it
among
the
right
people
and
in
the
right
position
i
imagine
you
see
by
this
time
that
it
much
use
otherwise
he
laughed
as
though
his
appreciation
of
her
words
rendered
them
almost
a
truism
to
him
and
there
was
a
silence
it
was
broken
by
julian
costs
a
lot
of
money
he
said
in
a
casual
indefinite
way
but
with
a
quick
glance
at
his
mother
it
cheap
certainly
was
the
laughing
answer
i
think
we
shall
then
noticing
something
a
little
deprecating
about
his
pose
and
expression
romayne
added
with
mock
reprehension
not
going
to
ask
me
to
raise
your
allowance
you
extravagant
boy
julian
moved
and
leaning
forward
clasped
his
hands
round
one
knee
as
if
the
uncomfortable
and
transitory
pose
assisted
explanation
he
laughed
back
at
her
but
he
was
looking
nevertheless
somewhat
ashamed
of
himself
not
that
exactly
he
began
rather
lamely
a
splendid
allowance
mother
dear
and
no
end
grateful
but
the
fact
is
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
lately
at
the
club
i
care
for
cards
you
know
but
one
must
play
a
bit
and
i
have
been
rather
a
fool
look
here
dear
i
suppose
i
suppose
you
let
me
have
two
hundred
could
you
before
we
go
away
you
know
hundred
julian
my
dear
boy
there
was
a
strong
tone
of
surprise
and
remonstrance
in
voice
and
there
was
also
a
very
distinct
note
of
annoyance
but
all
these
sentiments
seemed
rather
to
apply
to
the
demand
which
was
apparently
unseasonable
than
to
the
desirability
of
the
transaction
she
was
neither
startled
nor
distressed
is
young
fordyce
mother
continued
her
son
deprecatingly
was
awfully
foolish
to
play
with
him
so
beastly
lucky
and
you
see
i
must
settle
it
before
i
go
have
you
none
of
your
own
demanded
his
mother
with
some
asperity
in
her
tone
creditor
was
a
young
man
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
good
sort
of
fellow
who
would
never
in
society
awfully
sorry
to
say
i
returned
julian
meekly
there
was
a
pause
and
romayne
tapped
impatiently
on
the
papers
lying
by
her
is
such
an
inconvenient
moment
she
said
at
last
have
just
made
all
my
arrangements
for
the
quarter
i
mean
that
you
have
it
of
course
you
can
dear
but
it
is
difficult
to
lay
my
hand
on
it
at
this
could
arrange
it
for
you
suggested
julian
alluding
to
falconer
in
his
capacity
of
trustee
for
the
first
time
as
it
happened
romayne
started
violently
and
a
sharp
exclamation
of
dissent
rose
to
her
lips
she
stopped
it
half
uttered
and
paused
a
moment
controlling
herself
with
difficulty
she
said
at
last
in
rather
a
hard
tone
would
rather
not
do
that
i
will
think
it
over
and
see
what
can
be
done
we
must
raise
your
allowance
sir
i
have
mines
sprung
on
me
like
this
she
had
risen
as
she
spoke
and
as
he
followed
her
example
she
lifted
her
face
towards
him

the
kiss
which
always
passed
between
them

the
presented
a
singularly
fresh
and
unworn
appearance
considering
how
much
they
had
undergone
as
they
gradually
put
in
an
appearance
at
their
stall
on
the
following
day
and
gathered
together
in
little
knots
to
compare
notes
as
to
their
sufferings
and
here
and
there
to
allude
incidentally
to
their
takings
which
certainly
seemed
disproportionate
to
the
exertions
of
which
they
were
the
result
the
fancy
dress
idea
on
which
whole
soul
had
been
set
in
march
had
been
abandoned
when
halse
found
a
fresh
hobby
in
april
and
each
lady
wore
that
variety
of
the
fashion
of
the
day
which
seemed
most
desirable
in
her
eyes
all
the
dresses
were
very
and
as
their
wearers
moved
about
visiting
one
stalls
exchanging
greetings
and
inspecting
one
wares
with
critical
eyes
they
showed
to
conspicuous
advantage
for
during
the
first
hour
at
least
the
and
their
satellites
male
and
female
a
mere
handful
of
people
in
the
great
hall
had
the
entire
place
with
all
its
decorations
to
themselves
it
was
the
cheap
day
however
and
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
the
hall
gradually
filled
with
that
curious
class
of
person
which
is
always
craving
for
any
link
however
with
the
fashionable
world
and
makes
it
a
point
of
to
attend
all
public
functions
in
which
chances
to
be
engaged
these
votaries
of
fashion
walked
about
looking
not
at
the
stalls
but
at
the
ladies
in
attendance
on
them
turning
away
as
a
rule
in
stolid
silence
when
invited
in
mellifluous
tones
to
buy
or
perhaps
investing
a
shilling
when
long
search
had
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
a
twopenny
article
to
be
had
for
that
sum
for
the
sake
of
making
a
purchase
from
one
of
the
leaders
of
fashion
some
of
them
with
a
vague
notion
that
it
was
fashionable
to
every
one
kept
up
a
great
show
of
talk
and
laughter
and
were
constantly
seeing
acquaintances
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
with
whom
they
never
by
any
chance
came
in
contact
but
no
one
spent
more
than
five
shillings
and
the
began
to
find
the
position
pall
call
this
deadly
said
halse
subsiding
into
a
chair
and
looking
up
pathetically
at
julian
romayne
who
stood
by
julian
should
have
been
in
attendance
at
the
stall
next
but
one
where
pomeroy
and
his
mother
reigned
but
halse
in
view
of
the
exertions
before
her
had
summoned
to
her
aid
about
a
week
before
miss
hilda
newton
and
miss
hilda
newton
was
looking
irresistibly
bewitching
in
a
big
yellow
hat
her
spirits
also
bore
the
strain
of
the
proceedings
better
than
did
those
of
the
other
young
ladies
we
pick
out
some
things
cheap
with
a
little
grimace
go
about
among
the
people
and
try
and
sell
them
she
said
now
adventurously
looking
up
into
face
with
her
pretty
black
eyes
dancing
done
it
heaps
of
times
at
bazaars
and
it
always
goes
well
let
us
try
romayne
was
by
no
means
loath
and
a
few
minutes
later
his
mother
whose
eyes
had
been
covering
stall
all
the
time
she
tried
to
persuade
into
a
purchase
a
girl
whose
sole
object
was
a
sufficiently
prolonged
inspection
of
dress
to
enable
her
to
find
out
how
body
was
made
saw
them
sally
forth
together
laughing
and
talking
in
low
confidential
tones
her
lips
tightened
slightly
the
reappearance
of
miss
newton
had
found
dislike
to
the
pretty
opinionated
girl
as
active
and
apparently
unreasoning
as
it
had
been
on
her
previous
visit
a
very
good
idea
she
said
now
suavely
turning
to
pomeroy
who
sat
by
a
picture
of
placid
content
and
indicating
the
adventurous
pair
as
they
disappeared
among
the
people
must
try
something
of
the
sort
i
think
maud
miss
pomeroy
had
recently
become
maud
to
romayne
you
see
i
really
think
something
might
be
done
in
that
miss
pomeroy
who
was
standing
in
front
of
the
stall
a
charming
and
apparently
quite
inanimate
figure
in
white
assented
demurely
and
romayne
looking
round
for
a
man
caught
the
eye
of
loring
he
came
to
her
instantly
do
capitally
she
said
brightly
and
miss
pomeroy
making
no
objection
to
the
proceeding
was
started
forth
with
loring
the
latter
carrying
a
small
to
emulate
miss
newton
and
julian
that
was
quite
untouched
however
when
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
they
returned
to
the
stall
a
little
hot
and
discomfited
made
a
success
said
loring
with
a
rather
sardonic
smile
pomeroy
says
no
good
now
that
fellow
julian
doing
a
roaring
trade
julian
and
miss
newton
in
point
of
fact
were
at
that
moment
visible
returning
to
stall
evidently
in
high
feather
all
their
stock
sold
out
romayne
watched
julian
counting
his
gains
into
hand
saying
laughingly
to
loring
as
she
did
so
are
not
boy
enough
for
this
kind
of
thing
afraid
and
then
julian
with
a
final
laughing
nod
turned
away
from
halse
and
came
hastily
towards
his
stall
right
said
romayne
gaily
ignoring
the
fact
that
he
had
evidently
not
come
to
stay
was
just
wanting
you
sir
to
go
round
with
miss
pomeroy
if
she
will
kindly
go
with
you
and
get
rid
of
some
of
our
odds
and
ends
julian
stopped
short
and
flushed
a
little
awfully
sorry
he
said
come
back
and
do
it
with
pleasure
but
i
have
just
promised
to
go
round
again
with
miss
newton
i
came
to
see
if
you
could
give
us
some
his
mother
supplied
his
wants
smilingly
and
he
was
gone
she
had
turned
away
with
rather
compressed
lips
when
a
voice
behind
her
said
half
hesitatingly
half
gushingly
and
with
a
strong
german
accent
are
surely
unmistaken
it
is
yes
it
must
be
the
romayne
romayne
turned
quickly
and
gazed
at
the
speaker
obviously
unrecognisingly
nor
did
the
two
figures
with
whom
she
was
confronted
look
in
the
least
like
acquaintances
of
hers
they
were
young
women
of
the
plainest
and
most
angular
german
type
shabbily
dressed
according
to
the
canons
of
german
taste
remembers
us
not
gretchen
began
the
younger
of
the
two
and
then
a
sudden
light
of
recollection
broke
over
romayne
they
were
two
girls
who
had
been
training
for
a
musical
career
at
leipsic
whom
it
had
been
the
fashion
to
patronise
they
had
not
developed
as
had
been
expected
however
and
she
had
entirely
forgotten
their
existence
schmitz
she
said
now
with
distant
brightness
of
course
how
stupid
of
me
how
do
you
do
they
were
very
loquacious
romayne
had
heard
all
about
their
careers
all
the
reasons
that
had
led
to
their
spending
a
fortnight
in
london
and
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
moment
had
come
for
getting
rid
of
them
when
having
exhausted
themselves
in
compliments
on
her
appearance
they
enquired
after
julian
we
have
seen
romayne
said
the
elder
ah
but
much
since
we
had
the
pleasure
to
see
his
mother
it
was
in
alexandria
in
the
winter
past
we
hoped
that
some
concerts
there
might
be
possible
but
there
is
so
much
jealousy
and
favouritism
it
was
in
alexandria
that
we
met
him
he
was
travelling
in
egypt
he
told
to
said
romayne
smothering
a
yawn
was
in
egypt
she
stopped
suddenly
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
contract
strangely
did
you
say
you
saw
him
she
said
was
in
alexandria
he
was
there
for
the
day
only
and
he
was
to
us
most
kind
he
arrived
in
the
morning
early
by
the
same
train
and
he
showed
us
much
until
at
night
he
alexandria
at
alexandria
must
have
made
a
mistake
it
was
some
other
tone
was
curiously
unlike
that
in
which
she
had
conducted
the
early
part
of
the
conversation
it
was
sharp
and
direct
fräulein
schmitz
seemed
to
notice
and
resent
the
change
we
have
not
made
a
mistake
i
must
assure
you
she
said
stiffly
was
at
alexandria
we
saw
him
go
away
in
the
there
was
a
pause
romayne
was
looking
straight
before
her
with
those
strangely
contracted
eyes
her
lips
a
thin
pale
line
the
sisters
waited
a
moment
evidently
affronted
then
finding
that
romayne
took
no
notice
whatever
of
them
they
exchanged
resentful
glances
and
the
elder
spoke
will
say
she
said
formally
is
time
that
we
were
going
romayne
seemed
to
remember
their
presence
gradually
only
then
she
said
quickly
and
in
a
voice
that
sounded
as
though
her
throat
were
dry
are
going
at
once
right
out
of
the
hall
at
once
once
we
are
going
yes
was
the
reply
and
with
a
stiff
inclination
of
their
heads
they
moved
away
romayne
followed
the
two
angular
forms
with
her
eyes
until
they
reached
the
entrance
and
disappeared
then
she
swept
a
quick
glance
round
the
hall
julian
was
at
the
further
end
deeply
absorbed
in
his
proceedings
with
miss
newton
the
fräulein
schmitz
had
evidently
been
unseen
by
him
his
mother
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
a
strange
fixed
gaze
and
then
she
turned
her
eyes
away
mechanically
and
moved
her
mouth
with
a
little
twitch
as
though
she
felt
the
muscles
stiffening
and
knew
that
they
must
not
take
the
lines
they
would
there
was
a
deadly
pallor
about
her
mouth
at
that
instant
loring
came
up
to
her
with
a
witty
satirical
comment
on
the
scene
at
which
she
was
apparently
gazing
and
for
the
next
few
minutes
she
stood
there
exchanging
gay
little
observations
with
him
the
pallor
never
altering
her
eyes
never
moving
then
quite
suddenly
she
turned
towards
him
want
some
tea
she
said
me
to
the
refreshment
place
loring
julian
was
threading
his
way
to
where
she
stood
and
though
she
turned
instantly
in
the
direction
of
the
refreshment
stall
followed
perforce
by
loring
she
passed
close
to
him
he
stopped
and
said
something
but
she
only
nodded
to
him
and
went
rapidly
on
a
great
many
other
were
recruiting
themselves
with
tea
and
ices
and
they
were
all
more
or
less
in
spirits
real
or
affected
at
the
approaching
prospect
of
the
end
of
their
labours
romayne
was
instantly
hailed
as
one
of
a
very
smart
group
and
took
her
place
with
eager
gaiety
she
did
not
go
back
to
her
stall
tea
being
over
but
moved
about
the
bazaar
always
with
a
little
party
in
attendance
laughing
and
talking
she
and
julian
were
dining
with
a
large
party
of
at
they
were
all
to
repair
thither
direct
from
the
bazaar
and
romayne
took
a
detachment
in
her
carriage
only
one
instant
of
solitude
came
to
her
before
the
luxurious
hilarious
meal
only
one
instant
when
the
stream
of
descending
ladies
left
her
behind
on
an
upper
landing
in
that
instant
as
if
involuntarily
and
unconsciously
to
herself
the
gaiety
fell
from
her
face
like
a
mask
leaving
it
haggard
and
ghastly
she
put
her
hand
it
was
icy
cold
up
to
her
head
told
me
a
lie
she
said
to
herself
lie
oh
my
boy
she
was
very
bright
and
witty
as
she
and
julian
drove
home
together
and
the
greyish
whiteness
which
was
stealing
over
her
face
was
unnoticed
by
her
careless
eyes
even
when
they
stood
in
the
hall
you
going
straight
up
mother
he
said
so
say
good
night
i
want
a
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
him
with
that
indescribable
tenderness
which
haunted
her
eyes
at
times
as
they
rested
on
him
intensified
a
thousandfold
come
and
sit
with
you
for
a
little
while
if
you
will
have
me
she
said
she
tried
evidently
for
her
usual
manner
and
succeeded
inasmuch
as
julian
noticed
nothing
beyond
but
beneath
the
surface
there
was
something
not
wholly
to
be
suppressed
something
which
looked
out
of
her
eyes
trembled
in
her
voice
lingered
in
her
touch
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
something
which
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
shreds
of
affectation
with
which
she
strove
to
cover
it
and
with
the
profound
unconsciousness
was
as
pathetic
as
it
was
beautiful
and
strange
she
drew
him
into
his
own
little
room
and
then
with
a
forced
laugh
at
herself
she
pushed
him
gently
into
a
chair
and
insisted
on
waiting
upon
him
bringing
him
cigar
matches
anything
she
could
think
of
to
add
to
his
comfort
laughing
all
the
time
at
him
and
at
herself
and
hugging
those
shreds
of
affectation
close
but
there
was
that
about
her
if
there
had
been
any
one
to
see
and
understand
which
made
her
one
with
all
the
many
mothers
since
the
world
began
who
with
their
hearts
aching
and
bleeding
with
impotent
pity
and
love
have
tried
to
find
some
outlet
for
their
yearning
in
the
strange
instinct
for
service
which
goes
always
hand
in
hand
with
mother
love
as
with
no
other
love
on
earth
she
lit
his
match
at
last
and
then
knelt
down
beside
his
chair
dearest
she
said
dearest
you
shall
have
that
two
hundred
if
you
like
you
did
not
think
me
vexed
about
it
did
you
you
know
i
only
want
you
to
be
happy
julian
you
julian
laid
down
his
cigar
with
a
merry
laugh
should
be
a
fool
if
i
he
answered
patting
her
hand
with
boyish
affection
awfully
good
of
you
dear
and
frightfully
grateful
i
make
such
a
fool
of
myself
romayne
put
up
her
hand
quickly
promise
julian
she
said
in
a
strange
breathless
way
might
you
might
forget
you
know
and
then
perhaps
you
like
to
tell
me
and
i
want
to
know
i
always
want
to
know
she
stopped
abruptly
an
almost
agonised
appeal
in
her
eyes
she
was
still
kneeling
at
his
side
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
and
suddenly
abruptly
almost
as
though
the
words
forced
themselves
from
her
against
her
will
she
said
with
a
slight
catch
in
her
voice
i
met
fräulein
schmitz
he
met
her
eyes
for
a
moment
his
own
questioning
and
uncomprehending
then
gradually
there
stole
over
his
face
recollection
vague
at
first
which
became
as
it
grew
definite
rather
shamefaced
rather
annoyed
and
rather
amused
he
said
his
tone
was
light
and
daring
enough
though
a
touch
of
genuine
shame
and
embarrassment
lurked
in
it
i
call
that
hard
lines
he
was
smiling
daringly
into
her
face
with
an
acceptance
of
the
situation
that
was
perfectly
frank
his
hands
as
they
rested
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
were
tightly
wrung
together
and
her
eyes
never
stirred
from
his
face
she
said
rather
hoarsely
did
you
he
laughed
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
throwing
out
his
hands
with
a
graceful
foreign
movement
was
rather
a
culprit
you
see
he
said
only
spent
those
few
hours
in
alexandria
and
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
your
commission
and
i
felt
such
a
brute
about
it
that
i
up
to
confessing
it
was
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
and
it
conveyed
itself
as
such
romayne
knelt
there
for
a
moment
more
looking
into
his
eyes
her
own
wide
and
strained
and
then
she
rose
heavily
and
slowly
to
her
feet
there
was
a
pause
the
silence
was
broken
by
julian
evidently
with
a
view
to
changing
a
subject
on
which
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
show
to
conspicuous
advantage
going
to
write
to
falconer
i
suppose
you
like
to
do
it
dear
would
you
he
would
get
the
letter
in
better
time
if
it
was
posted
the
first
thing
you
could
do
it
at
my
table
there
romayne
did
not
speak
julian
could
not
see
her
face
she
said
at
last
and
her
voice
sounded
rather
hollow
and
far
away
will
do
it
if
you
she
bent
down
and
kissed
him
night
she
said
you
write
here
said
julian
in
some
surprise
go
upstairs
she
answered
and
went
out
of
the
room
she
went
upstairs
moving
slowly
and
heavily
straight
to
her
dainty
little
and
sat
down
drawing
out
a
sheet
of
paper
she
wrote
the
conventional
words
of
address
to
dennis
falconer
and
then
she
stopped
suddenly
and
lifted
her
face
it
was
ghastly
the
eyes
sunken
and
dim
seemed
to
be
confronting
the
very
irony
of
fate
chapter
xiv
jolliest
week
ever
had
in
my
life
wonder
how
often
said
that
before
august
had
come
and
gone
the
greater
part
of
september
had
followed
in
its
wake
and
a
ruddy
september
sun
was
making
the
end
of
the
summer
glorious
in
the
large
garden
of
a
large
country
house
in
norfolk
everything
seen
in
its
wonderful
radiance
seemed
to
be
even
overcharged
with
colour
if
such
a
thing
is
possible
with
nature
it
was
as
though
all
the
beauty
of
the
summer
had
been
intensified
and
arrested
in
its
maturity
into
one
final
glow
the
rich
green
of
the
smooth
lawns
the
colours
of
the
autumnal
flowers
the
tints
of
the
foliage
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
all
alike
to
be
pausing
for
the
moment
at
the
most
perfect
point
of
radiance
but
nature
never
pauses
and
that
this
was
indeed
the
final
glow
the
end
of
her
summer
beauty
was
revealed
here
and
there
by
little
significant
touches
or
written
across
earth
and
sky
in
broader
letters
the
birds
were
gone
or
going
even
as
julian
romayne
spoke
a
flight
of
swallows
overhead
was
wheeling
and
darting
hither
and
thither
in
preparation
for
an
imminent
departure
the
very
glory
of
the
trees
meant
decay
and
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
indefatigable
gardeners
dead
leaves
strewed
the
trim
lawns
and
gravel
paths
all
these
signs
and
tokens
of
the
approach
of
the
inevitable
end
were
particularly
conspicuous
about
the
narrow
grass
path
shut
in
by
high
yew
hedges
up
and
down
which
julian
romayne
and
hilda
newton
were
sauntering
together
fallen
leaves
were
thick
upon
it
and
in
the
by
which
it
was
bordered
the
summer
flowers
whose
day
was
long
since
done
had
not
been
replaced
by
their
autumn
successors
apparently
the
walk
was
a
secluded
and
little
frequented
one
on
which
it
was
not
worth
while
to
spend
much
pains
judging
from
the
coquettish
toss
of
the
head
tempered
by
a
certain
softness
of
tone
with
which
miss
newton
replied
to
the
insinuated
regret
of
words
it
seemed
not
improbable
that
those
characteristics
had
something
to
do
with
their
selection
of
that
particular
spot
for
their
stroll
they
had
been
staying
in
this
pleasant
country
house
together
for
the
last
week
the
hostess
having
taken
a
fancy
to
cousin
in
town
and
now
in
another
hour
julian
and
his
mother
would
be
on
their
way
home
as
the
words
fell
from
his
lips
julian
turned
impetuously
towards
the
pretty
piquant
face
it
was
shaded
by
a
bewitching
garden
hat
never
meant
it
so
much
before
on
my
honour
he
said
impulsively
adding
with
a
boyish
suggestion
of
tender
reproach
in
his
voice
should
have
thought
you
might
have
known
that
awfully
hard
lines
to
think
miss
newton
had
a
large
crimson
dahlia
in
her
hand
and
she
was
plucking
the
petals
slowly
away
and
scattering
them
at
her
feet
it
she
said
know
it
is
he
returned
ardently
trying
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
dark
face
bent
over
the
crimson
flower
you
tell
me
that
a
little
sorry
too
miss
newton
hilda
his
vigorous
young
hand
was
just
closing
over
the
pretty
little
fingers
that
held
the
dahlia
the
dainty
little
figure
was
yielding
to
him
nothing
loath
it
seemed
when
from
the
further
end
of
the
grass
walk
a
third
voice
broke
in
upon
their
and
as
they
started
instinctively
apart
romayne
accompanied
by
their
hostess
came
sauntering
towards
them
a
farewell
look
at
the
quaint
old
walk
julian
she
said
with
suave
carelessness
as
she
drew
near
them
garden
is
looking
too
beautiful
this
morning
it
miss
newton
what
a
lovely
dahlia
that
is
you
were
showing
julian
she
looked
smilingly
at
miss
newton
as
she
spoke
apparently
quite
unconscious
that
the
face
was
white
not
with
embarrassment
disappointment
or
emotion
but
with
sheer
angry
resentment
and
she
moved
on
as
she
spoke
tacitly
compelling
miss
newton
to
move
on
at
her
side
while
julian
and
the
other
lady
followed
perforce
together
have
only
about
ten
minutes
more
afraid
she
said
was
just
taking
a
last
stroll
round
the
place
with
ponsonby
afraid
we
shall
find
london
rather
unbearable
the
call
of
duty
is
always
so
very
inconvenient
she
was
leading
the
way
toward
the
house
and
her
little
laugh
eliciting
only
a
monosyllabic
response
from
the
girl
at
her
side
she
resumed
what
was
practically
a
monologue
carried
on
with
a
suavity
and
ease
which
was
perhaps
by
just
a
touch
her
farewells
which
followed
almost
immediately
on
their
arrival
at
the
house
when
a
little
bustle
of
departure
ensued
in
which
miss
newton
took
no
part
that
young
lady
having
promptly
disappeared
were
characterised
by
the
same
manner
about
which
there
was
also
a
little
touch
of
suppressed
excitement
it
was
not
until
she
and
julian
were
alone
together
in
a
carriage
of
the
london
express
that
her
gay
words
and
laughs
ceased
and
she
let
herself
sink
back
in
her
corner
unfolding
a
newspaper
with
a
short
hardly
audible
sigh
of
relief
a
very
slight
and
indefinable
change
had
come
to
face
in
the
course
of
the
last
two
months
it
had
been
perceptible
in
her
animation
and
was
still
more
perceptible
in
her
repose
the
lines
about
her
face
which
had
needed
special
influences
to
bring
them
into
prominence
during
the
winter
were
always
plainly
perceptible
now
and
they
gave
her
face
a
very
slightly
careworn
look
which
was
emphasized
by
the
expression
of
her
eyes
and
mouth
the
eyes
had
always
a
slightly
restless
look
in
them
in
these
days
even
now
as
she
read
her
paper
or
appeared
to
read
it
there
was
no
concentration
in
them
and
every
now
and
then
they
were
lifted
hastily
almost
furtively
over
the
edge
the
mouth
was
at
once
weaker
and
more
determined
weaker
inasmuch
as
it
had
grown
more
sensitive
more
nervously
responsive
to
the
movements
of
her
restless
eyes
and
more
determined
as
though
with
the
expression
of
a
constant
mental
attitude
there
was
a
good
deal
of
indecision
in
her
face
and
its
expression
varied
slightly
but
incessantly
as
she
fixed
her
eyes
anew
on
the
printed
words
before
her
after
each
fleeting
glance
at
the
boyish
face
outlined
by
the
cushions
opposite
she
laid
down
her
paper
at
last
with
a
little
deliberate
rustle
apparently
intended
to
attract
attention
and
as
she
did
so
her
face
assumed
its
ordinary
superficial
vivacity
an
expression
which
harmonised
less
well
with
the
rather
sharpened
features
than
it
had
done
three
months
before
good
novel
julian
she
said
airily
smothering
a
yawn
as
she
spoke
and
indicating
with
a
little
gesture
of
her
head
the
book
in
hand
julian
had
been
holding
the
book
in
his
hand
ever
since
they
left
the
little
norfolk
station
from
which
they
had
started
but
he
had
scarcely
turned
a
page
his
features
were
composed
into
an
expression
of
boyish
resentment
about
which
there
was
that
distinct
suggestion
of
sullenness
which
is
the
usual
outward
expression
of
the
hauteur
of
youth
as
his
mother
spoke
he
flushed
hotly
with
angry
particularly
he
said
without
lifting
his
eyes
there
was
a
pause
during
which
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
with
concentration
enough
in
them
now
and
then
she
broke
into
a
light
laugh
and
leaning
suddenly
forward
laid
one
of
her
hands
on
his
old
boy
she
said
in
a
tone
half
mocking
half
sympathising
was
very
hard
on
you
it
a
cruel
fate
that
makes
young
men
so
ineligible
and
girls
so
pretty
and
throws
the
two
perversely
together
if
any
thought
to
spare
from
yourself
sir
though
i
think
you
should
bestow
a
little
gratitude
upon
me
for
my
very
timely
arrival
she
laughed
again
and
in
her
laugh
as
in
her
voice
there
was
the
faintest
possible
touch
of
reality
and
that
reality
was
anxiety
then
as
julian
twisted
his
hand
from
under
hers
with
a
gruff
and
almost
inaudible
see
that
she
leant
back
in
her
seat
again
with
a
smile
dear
boy
she
said
gaily
a
very
sad
position
for
you
i
admit
but
for
the
present
dependent
on
your
mother
not
such
a
very
stingy
mother
eh
sir
i
think
find
it
will
be
all
right
for
you
when
the
right
young
woman
turns
up
as
no
doubt
she
will
some
day
perhaps
find
that
your
mother
abdicate
so
very
ungracefully
but
you
see
it
must
be
the
right
young
woman
in
spite
of
the
laugh
in
it
there
was
a
ring
in
the
tone
in
which
the
words
were
spoken
which
was
full
of
significance
and
the
significance
and
the
laughter
seemed
to
be
doing
battle
together
as
romayne
went
on
ignoring
interjection
think
you
would
have
found
it
a
very
pleasant
situation
to
be
engaged
to
miss
newton
with
the
prospect
before
you
of
keeping
her
waiting
until
you
had
made
your
fortune
at
the
bar
and
sorry
to
say
i
share
your
conviction
of
the
moment
that
she
is
the
right
young
woman
she
is
very
pretty
i
allow
and
a
very
nice
girl
no
voice
grew
a
little
hard
as
she
said
the
last
words
not
at
all
the
sort
of
girl
that
i
should
like
you
to
marry
she
has
no
money
in
the
first
have
enough
for
both
said
julian
impetuously
and
then
stopped
short
and
coloured
crimson
his
mother
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
poor
boy
she
said
have
enough
for
both
just
what
i
want
you
to
remember
in
your
intercourse
with
pretty
girls
after
all
you
know
the
position
has
its
advantages
you
may
flirt
as
much
as
you
like
while
known
to
be
dependent
on
your
mother
and
no
one
will
take
you
too
julian
did
not
echo
her
laugh
nor
did
he
make
any
comment
on
her
words
he
sat
with
his
face
turned
away
from
her
and
a
rather
strange
expression
in
his
eyes
an
expression
which
was
at
once
unformed
and
mutinous
his
mother
could
not
see
it
but
the
outline
of
his
profile
apparently
disturbed
her
the
anxiety
in
her
face
deepened
again
mixed
this
time
with
an
expression
of
doubt
and
as
though
to
emphasize
the
lightness
of
her
preceding
tone
she
turned
the
conversation
into
a
comment
on
the
landscape
and
took
up
her
paper
again
the
remainder
of
the
journey
passed
in
total
silence
and
the
drive
home
from
the
station
was
silent
too
an
arrival
in
london
at
the
end
of
september
is
not
a
very
pleasant
proceeding
unless
it
is
approached
with
considerable
industry
determination
and
a
large
stock
of
energy
the
butterflies
of
society
and
indeed
a
large
proportion
of
the
bees
have
not
yet
returned
those
who
have
returned
have
done
so
under
stern
compulsion
to
begin
the
work
and
there
is
a
general
sentiment
as
of
the
end
of
holidays
and
the
beginning
of
term
time
the
day
that
had
been
so
radiantly
lovely
in
norfolk
had
evidently
been
oppressively
hot
and
airless
in
town
and
the
general
air
of
exhaustion
and
squalor
which
such
circumstances
are
apt
to
produce
in
london
did
not
help
to
render
its
appearance
more
attractive
number
queen
anne
street
chelsea
itself
seemed
to
be
touched
by
the
general
depression
the
summer
flowers
in
the
had
been
taken
away
and
their
successors
were
apparently
waiting
for
orders
from
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
as
romayne
and
julian
entered
the
hall
there
was
that
indefinable
atmosphere
about
the
house
which
two
abandonment
to
even
the
best
of
servants
is
apt
to
produce
an
atmosphere
which
is
the
reverse
of
cheerful
there
were
letters
lying
on
the
one
of
which
romayne
handed
to
julian
with
the
comment
allardyce
it
julian
will
he
be
ready
for
you
legal
studies
were
in
fact
to
begin
in
earnest
on
the
following
day
and
when
the
next
morning
he
said
to
his
mother
and
set
out
for
the
temple
she
followed
him
to
the
door
with
a
laughing
that
at
least
was
her
ostensible
motive
but
there
was
something
in
her
face
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
as
he
turned
away
on
the
doorstep
which
suggested
that
the
last
words
she
said
to
him
were
those
that
she
had
really
followed
him
to
say
time
shall
you
be
back
julian
and
as
he
answered
carelessly
tell
not
till
i
expect
there
came
into
her
eyes
a
curious
shadow
of
yearning
anxiety
care
of
yourself
sir
she
said
lightly
and
went
back
into
the
house
that
shadow
lived
in
her
eyes
all
day
as
she
went
about
giving
orders
and
things
to
rights
as
she
said
striving
in
fact
with
a
concealed
earnestness
which
seemed
somewhat
disproportionate
to
its
object
to
give
the
house
that
peculiar
air
of
brightness
which
had
been
so
characteristic
of
it
and
which
somehow
did
not
seem
so
easily
to
be
obtained
as
formerly
her
face
was
gaiety
itself
however
when
she
stood
in
the
as
the
rang
very
daintily
dressed
in
a
which
julian
had
admired
waiting
for
her
son
a
moment
elapsed
and
julian
dashed
downstairs
breathless
and
apologetic
but
rather
sparing
of
his
words
his
first
work
hardly
seemed
to
have
dissipated
the
cloud
which
had
hung
about
him
that
morning
at
breakfast
and
as
his
mother
slipped
her
hand
playfully
into
his
arm
with
a
laughing
word
or
two
of
forgiveness
he
turned
and
led
her
out
of
the
room
without
the
response
which
would
have
been
natural
to
him
you
had
a
pleasant
day
said
romayne
lightly
as
they
sat
down
to
dinner
well
returned
julian
indifferently
he
said
no
more
and
romayne
with
one
of
her
quick
glances
at
him
began
to
talk
of
her
own
day
she
had
paid
some
calls
in
the
afternoon
and
had
a
great
deal
of
news
for
him
as
to
who
had
and
who
had
not
returned
to
town
and
a
great
deal
of
gossip
which
was
both
amusing
in
itself
and
rendered
more
amusing
by
the
piquant
animation
with
which
she
retailed
it
it
failed
to
rouse
much
interest
in
julian
apparently
however
and
after
a
time
his
mother
returned
to
her
original
topic
again
with
a
quick
anxious
glance
at
his
face
you
find
allardyce
easy
to
work
with
she
enquired
interestedly
this
time
i
suppose
so
was
the
unresponsive
response
long
did
he
keep
you
got
away
at
four
something
seemed
to
leap
in
eyes
to
be
instantly
suppressed
as
she
said
with
an
indifference
which
any
ear
keener
than
might
have
detected
to
be
forced
and
what
have
you
been
doing
since
then
may
i
ask
you
did
not
come
in
till
a
quarter
past
perhaps
julian
felt
the
inquisition
in
the
question
though
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
unusual
in
his
voice
for
he
answered
rather
briefly
went
to
the
garrick
with
a
fellow
demanded
his
mother
in
the
same
tone
julian
moved
impatiently
another
fellow
reading
with
allardyce
he
answered
he
took
me
as
though
the
suppressed
impatience
of
his
tone
had
not
escaped
her
romayne
found
herself
reminded
at
this
point
of
something
she
had
heard
that
afternoon
during
one
of
her
visits
and
she
proceeded
to
place
her
little
piece
of
news
before
julian
with
every
advantage
that
narration
could
give
it
though
her
face
looked
rather
thin
and
sharp
as
she
talked
dinner
was
over
by
this
time
and
as
she
finished
with
a
laugh
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
put
her
hand
on
arm
his
face
was
somewhat
bored
and
dissatisfied
as
though
his
effort
for
his
entertainment
entirely
failed
to
compensate
him
for
the
merry
of
the
last
month
think
i
shall
have
to
come
and
keep
you
company
while
you
smoke
your
cigar
she
said
lightly
adding
with
an
assumption
of
a
sudden
thought
on
the
subject
which
was
not
wholly
successful
the
garrick
club
must
be
a
most
attractive
spot
if
you
stayed
there
from
four
till
seven
julian
took
a
quick
step
forward
the
movement
might
have
been
due
to
his
desire
to
open
the
door
for
her
or
it
might
have
been
an
expression
of
the
irritation
of
which
his
face
was
full
get
there
at
four
he
said
really
know
what
time
it
was
but
it
must
have
been
nearly
five
and
i
walked
home
so
i
left
somewhere
about
the
irritation
was
in
his
voice
as
well
as
in
his
face
and
his
mother
patted
him
gaily
on
the
shoulder
with
her
most
artificially
laugh
quite
annoyed
at
being
asked
so
many
questions
she
exclaimed
a
dreadful
nuisance
to
have
such
a
silly
old
mother
it
but
you
told
me
what
griffiths
is
like
yet
julian
had
tried
to
laugh
in
answer
to
her
first
words
but
the
sound
produced
had
been
almost
as
greatly
wanting
in
reality
as
had
been
the
ease
of
his
tone
and
he
answered
now
with
undisguised
impatience
oh
like
any
other
fellow
mother
nothing
particular
one
way
or
the
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
hastily
was
rather
thinking
of
running
down
to
the
club
this
evening
dear
if
you
mind
being
alone
i
want
to
hear
whether
loring
has
come
back
just
a
chance
he
might
be
there
you
he
had
said
that
morning
that
there
was
no
likelihood
of
returning
for
another
two
or
three
days
but
romayne
forbore
to
remind
him
of
that
fact
nor
did
she
allude
to
the
conviction
which
had
turned
her
suddenly
rather
pale
namely
that
his
thoughts
of
going
down
to
the
club
had
arisen
within
the
last
few
minutes
well
dear
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
by
all
means
oh
no
i
shall
be
quite
happy
with
a
he
did
not
look
back
at
her
as
he
left
the
room
after
another
word
or
two
or
the
expression
on
her
face
might
have
arrested
even
his
youthfully
and
preoccupied
attention
loring
was
not
at
the
club
nor
was
there
any
information
to
be
obtained
there
as
to
his
movements
julian
played
a
game
of
billiards
and
lost
it
through
sheer
carelessness
and
then
determined
to
go
home
again
he
would
walk
part
of
the
way
he
said
to
himself
though
he
had
had
one
walk
that
day
he
wanted
to
things
the
phrase
was
serious
and
by
comparison
with
the
process
to
which
it
was
attached
grandiloquent
mental
apparatus
was
at
present
as
undeveloped
as
that
of
a
fashionable
young
man
of
may
usually
be
taken
to
be
the
process
of
things
over
as
conducted
within
his
head
involved
no
stern
process
of
reasoning
no
exhaustive
system
of
logical
deduction
from
cause
to
effect
no
opinions
of
the
past
or
decisions
for
the
future
when
he
proposed
to
himself
to
things
over
in
short
he
simply
meant
that
he
should
ring
a
strictly
limited
number
of
changes
on
the
fact
that
as
he
expressed
it
vaguely
to
himself
it
was
hard
it
had
taken
him
some
time
to
come
to
this
conclusion
he
had
flirted
with
miss
hilda
newton
very
happily
for
the
last
ten
days
with
a
great
deal
of
wholly
unnecessary
assistance
from
that
young
lady
herself
without
the
very
faintest
definite
intentions
towards
her
he
had
enjoyed
it
and
she
had
enjoyed
it
and
the
idea
which
had
occurred
to
him
once
or
twice
that
his
mother
did
not
enjoy
it
had
not
particularly
affected
him
circumstances
alone
would
have
been
responsible
for
the
proposal
which
had
so
nearly
been
an
accomplished
fact
on
the
day
before
and
had
the
speech
to
miss
newton
interrupted
by
romayne
reached
its
legitimate
conclusion
and
received
its
inevitable
response
it
was
extremely
likely
that
he
might
by
this
time
have
been
the
victim
of
a
vague
consciousness
of
having
made
a
mistake
but
it
had
been
interrupted
and
a
sense
of
having
been
thwarted
was
consequently
not
unnatural
in
its
author
that
sense
of
injury
which
might
have
passed
away
in
mere
sentiment
but
which
on
the
other
hand
might
if
it
had
been
left
untouched
by
words
have
developed
into
a
secret
breach
between
mother
and
son
had
been
focussed
and
rendered
definite
and
tangible
as
it
were
by
his
laughing
speeches
in
the
train
it
was
as
he
had
sat
gazing
blankly
out
of
the
window
during
the
last
of
their
journey
that
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
before
mentioned
that
it
was
hard
makes
a
fellow
feel
such
a
fool
he
said
to
himself
as
morosely
as
the
undeveloped
nature
of
his
temperament
permitted
as
he
issued
moodily
from
his
club
and
started
in
the
direction
of
piccadilly
makes
a
fellow
feel
such
a
confounded
fool
he
could
not
reduce
this
general
principle
to
detail
but
what
he
really
felt
was
something
of
the
sensation
of
the
child
who
realises
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
the
of
the
fairyland
of
shadows
in
which
he
has
been
performing
prodigies
of
valour
all
the
intercourse
with
the
pretty
girls
of
his
which
julian
had
hitherto
accepted
simply
and
unquestioningly
had
suddenly
become
flat
stale
and
unprofitable
to
him
all
illusions
had
gone
from
it
and
the
reality
was
painfully
unsatisfying
and
wounding
to
his
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
a
vague
understanding
and
a
practical
realisation
julian
had
known
of
course
from
the
very
first
that
he
was
dependent
on
his
mother
but
he
had
never
felt
it
until
the
previous
day
he
had
known
that
marriage
without
her
consent
was
practically
impossible
for
him
but
the
fact
had
never
before
been
brought
home
to
him
the
veto
which
had
descended
so
impalpably
and
decisively
upon
what
he
was
now
prepared
to
characterise
as
his
hopes
with
regard
to
miss
newton
shrivelling
them
to
nothingness
had
also
shrivelled
away
all
the
embellishing
haze
by
which
the
conditions
of
his
life
had
been
surrounded
the
background
to
all
his
thoughts
on
the
subject
the
background
which
had
grown
up
almost
without
consciousness
on
his
own
part
with
his
first
humiliated
realisation
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
which
remained
a
vague
brooding
shadow
in
his
mind
was
resentment
against
his
mother
a
resentment
which
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
careless
and
effusive
affection
of
his
attitude
to
her
hitherto
threw
a
curious
light
on
his
relations
with
her
but
against
this
background
and
affecting
him
far
more
keenly
was
a
sore
sense
that
life
had
suddenly
lost
its
savour
for
him
the
charm
of
flirtation
had
vanished
utterly
before
his
words
as
to
its
harmlessness
the
privilege
which
she
assigned
to
him
seemed
to
reduce
him
to
the
level
of
a
shadow
among
substances
to
put
him
at
a
hopeless
disadvantage
with
all
the
women
of
his
world
and
render
his
intercourse
with
them
a
farce
of
which
both
they
and
he
must
be
perfectly
conscious
all
such
utter
humbug
he
said
to
himself
that
being
the
nearest
definition
he
could
attain
of
the
vague
thoughts
that
were
passing
through
his
mind
then
he
ceased
to
express
himself
even
mentally
and
walked
along
meditating
moodily
and
discontentedly
he
was
walking
along
piccadilly
when
he
found
his
thoughts
gradually
returning
to
his
actual
surroundings
as
though
something
were
drawing
them
unconsciously
to
himself
as
extraneous
objects
which
one
is
not
even
aware
of
noticing
will
sometimes
do
it
was
about
eleven
not
a
very
pleasant
time
in
piccadilly
and
the
pavement
was
by
no
means
crowded
the
first
detail
to
which
he
awoke
was
the
hilarious
demeanour
of
a
young
man
just
in
front
of
him
who
was
walking
very
unsteadily
in
the
same
direction
as
himself
he
was
a
young
man
of
the
commonest
cockney
type
obviously
in
the
maudlin
stage
of
intoxication
as
senses
became
more
fully
alive
he
noticed
a
pace
or
two
in
front
of
the
young
man
the
figure
of
a
girl
she
was
walking
hurriedly
and
nervously
and
as
the
young
man
quickened
his
uneven
steps
in
response
to
a
sudden
quickening
of
hers
julian
saw
that
the
intoxicated
speeches
which
had
first
grown
into
his
own
meditation
were
addressed
to
the
girl
and
that
she
was
trying
in
vain
to
escape
from
them
it
was
not
a
particularly
uncommon
sight
for
a
london
street
and
a
glance
would
naturally
have
been
all
the
attention
julian
would
have
vouchsafed
it
but
as
the
pair
preceded
him
up
piccadilly
the
girl
shrinking
and
afraid
afraid
to
attract
attention
by
too
rapid
movements
as
much
afraid
as
her
nervous
undecided
glances
around
her
showed
of
the
help
a
protest
might
attract
to
her
as
of
her
pursuer
the
man
sodden
and
brutal
absolutely
destitute
for
the
moment
of
reasoning
faculty
julian
found
his
attention
fascinated
by
them
a
spark
of
natural
youthful
chivalry
entirely
undeveloped
by
his
life
stirred
in
him
he
quickened
his
steps
involuntarily
apparently
and
with
no
definite
intention
for
he
was
just
passing
them
with
a
quick
undecided
glance
at
the
girl
when
he
saw
her
stop
suddenly
and
shrink
back
against
a
neighbouring
whether
a
faint
shriek
really
came
from
her
or
not
he
never
knew
but
her
eyes
met
his
and
appealed
to
him
almost
as
if
without
the
consciousness
the
man
had
laid
a
hot
drunken
hand
upon
the
worn
ungloved
fingers
julian
stopped
go
he
said
peremptorily
his
tone
was
so
sharp
and
the
interference
was
so
sudden
and
that
the
man
stupid
with
drink
did
as
he
was
bidden
as
if
involuntarily
off
continued
julian
in
the
same
tone
the
man
stared
at
him
for
a
minute
and
broke
into
a
maudlin
laugh
a
discordant
snatch
of
a
comic
song
and
staggered
on
his
way
as
though
the
sudden
breaking
of
his
chain
of
ideas
had
obliterated
the
girl
from
his
memory
she
was
standing
as
julian
turned
to
her
leaning
back
against
the
shaking
from
head
to
foot
but
evidently
making
a
violent
effort
to
control
herself
you
sir
she
murmured
tremulously
and
was
moving
to
go
on
her
way
with
faltering
trembling
footsteps
when
julian
stopped
her
is
not
a
nice
place
for
you
to
be
alone
in
he
said
almost
involuntarily
you
far
to
go
he
had
looked
at
her
for
that
moment
during
which
she
had
stood
motionless
with
her
face
outlined
against
the
dark
shutter
with
a
strangely
mingled
feeling
that
her
face
was
wonderfully
unlike
any
with
which
he
was
acquainted
and
yet
that
he
had
actually
seen
it
before
seen
it
and
experienced
the
same
sensation
it
was
white
now
to
the
very
lips
and
the
great
brown
eyes
dark
and
liquid
looked
out
from
under
their
soft
lashes
and
level
eyebrows
wide
with
terror
and
distress
her
features
were
beautifully
formed
though
they
were
so
thin
and
worn
that
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
julian
to
class
her
among
the
ranks
of
pretty
girls
but
the
real
charm
of
her
face
lay
about
her
mouth
it
was
very
strong
though
the
strength
was
latent
and
entirely
unconscious
very
simple
and
very
sweet
and
even
the
pallor
of
her
lips
and
the
slight
trembling
about
them
could
not
detract
from
the
beauty
of
the
line
they
made
her
hair
as
julian
noticed
was
of
a
soft
black
and
very
luxuriant
she
was
rather
tall
and
her
shabby
jacket
concealed
and
spoilt
the
outline
of
her
figure
but
the
set
of
her
head
was
full
of
instinctive
grace
she
paused
a
moment
before
she
answered
him
looking
into
his
face
with
a
simple
directness
which
had
a
dignity
of
its
own
sir
she
said
in
a
low
voice
which
shook
a
little
in
spite
of
her
evident
efforts
to
steady
it
the
hammersmith
not
going
to
walk
are
you
said
julian
apparently
her
glance
at
his
face
had
satisfied
her
she
answered
him
this
time
without
hesitation
sir
she
said
her
voice
was
very
musical
and
refined
it
harmonised
better
with
her
face
than
with
her
worn
dress
and
the
dignified
deference
of
her
manner
you
must
let
me
see
you
safely
part
of
the
way
at
any
rate
said
julian
impulsively
she
hesitated
and
looked
at
him
again
and
this
time
the
large
eyes
grew
moist
with
tears
very
silly
of
me
she
said
tremulously
i
think
it
was
his
touching
me
that
upset
me
she
had
been
rubbing
one
hand
all
this
time
mechanically
and
involuntarily
as
it
seemed
over
the
hand
on
which
that
drunken
touch
had
fallen
did
try
to
get
a
but
they
were
all
full
i
let
you
take
such
it
needed
only
the
unconscious
gratitude
of
those
words
to
convince
julian
that
it
would
be
no
trouble
whatever
and
he
asserted
the
same
with
an
assumption
of
authority
and
masterfulness
quite
new
to
him
it
was
an
hour
and
a
half
later
when
his
mother
sitting
up
wakeful
in
her
own
room
caught
the
slight
sound
made
by
his
in
the
door
and
noticed
a
pause
before
the
door
was
opened
in
that
pause
there
had
come
to
julian
one
of
those
sudden
flashes
of
light
which
sometimes
illuminate
a
question
course
he
said
to
himself
as
he
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
course
