chapter
the
shadow
in
the
sunshine
and
the
sunlight
clasps
the
earth
shelley
from
her
chamber
window
he
would
catch
her
beauty
faster
than
the
falcon
spies
and
constant
as
her
vespers
would
he
watch
because
her
face
was
turned
to
the
same
skies
keats
a
bright
sunny
morning
at
the
end
of
june
in
busy
restless
london
the
overarching
vault
of
heaven
was
filled
with
an
atmosphere
of
golden
hue
sunshine
was
glowing
upon
cathedral
turrets
and
upon
the
church
spires
upon
the
pinnacles
of
lofty
buildings
and
the
crowns
of
tall
factory
shafts
the
bronzed
and
tarnished
ball
and
cross
of
and
the
monument
which
a
tall
bully
lifts
its
head
shone
as
if
they
had
been
newly
gilded
there
was
sunshine
upon
and
housetops
golden
beams
permeating
the
confined
air
in
close
garrets
through
their
narrow
windows
flooding
wide
streets
and
illuminating
pestiferous
courts
where
riotous
hilarity
sometimes
but
joy
never
came
sunshine
blazed
upon
the
broad
and
winding
thames
over
whose
flowing
surface
lazy
barges
dawdled
and
panting
river
steamers
raced
leaving
in
their
sinuous
paths
myriads
of
scintillations
and
rather
an
unpleasant
odour
as
well
sunshine
was
on
the
footways
and
in
the
roadways
and
in
the
gutters
making
mirrors
of
small
muddy
pools
sunshine
there
was
for
the
ragged
and
the
richly
dressed
for
the
beggar
and
the
prince
alike
for
the
robust
and
happily
for
the
sickly
invalid
sunshine
everywhere
making
brilliant
the
parks
and
open
places
and
interpenetrating
all
the
foulest
recesses
of
this
huge
city
giving
light
where
it
was
rarely
seen
and
rousing
to
a
glad
activity
the
teeming
life
already
in
its
first
throes
of
daily
labour
beautiful
in
this
the
bright
sunshine
but
oh
yet
more
enchanting
in
the
glory
with
which
it
invested
the
fair
face
of
a
young
girl
peering
out
of
the
upper
window
of
a
house
situated
in
one
of
the
closest
streets
she
stood
there
gazing
heavenward
her
mild
blue
eyes
bending
beneath
the
influence
of
the
golden
glare
of
of
light
yet
seeming
to
revel
in
their
luxuriance
as
though
they
spoke
to
her
in
fairy
language
of
other
and
happier
times
and
places
now
far
away
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
in
the
shop
of
a
working
goldsmith
one
john
harper
there
stood
a
youth
an
apprentice
to
the
noble
art
of
working
in
gold
the
beauty
and
the
clearness
of
the
fair
morning
had
elevated
and
refreshed
his
youthful
spirits
but
ah
how
much
greater
their
exhilaration
when
his
upturned
eyes
were
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
that
beautiful
young
girl
whose
radiant
face
and
delicately
modelled
form
were
brought
out
in
brilliant
relief
by
the
dazzling
sunbeams
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
brightest
conceptions
of
the
beautiful
his
dreamy
fashionings
of
a
faultless
ideal
combined
with
all
his
native
and
his
acquired
skill
had
never
yet
enabled
him
to
realise
thing
of
to
rival
the
perfect
excellence
and
marvellous
charms
of
that
young
face
upon
which
his
eager
eyes
were
now
fastened
raphael
in
his
rarest
had
not
in
his
belief
attained
the
sentiment
of
angelic
purity
beaming
in
her
features
nor
had
carlo
dolci
in
the
loveliest
madonna
he
ever
painted
anticipated
it
motionless
he
stood
and
with
suspended
breath
gazed
upon
her
as
though
she
were
one
lone
bright
star
shining
unaccompanied
in
the
vast
field
of
the
deep
blue
heavens
in
the
silent
night
his
mind
the
while
lost
in
a
maze
of
rapture
and
of
wonder
yet
he
had
seen
it
often
for
years
and
now
he
had
a
consciousness
that
a
saddening
gloom
overspread
the
earth
far
and
near
what
made
the
surrounding
space
in
a
moment
so
sombre
had
a
huge
cloud
suddenly
sprung
up
from
its
sullen
rest
and
spreading
itself
enviously
over
the
broad
sky
absorbed
the
sunlight
was
the
sunshine
which
had
converted
smoky
london
into
a
city
of
golden
palaces
abruptly
withdrawn
no
sunbeams
yet
glanced
upon
the
buildings
and
danced
upon
the
rippling
waters
but
the
young
maiden
had
disappeared
from
her
window
she
had
suddenly
fled
from
it
as
a
startled
fawn
would
spring
into
a
covert
at
the
sound
of
the
approaching
footsteps
of
a
hunter
bent
upon
its
destruction
so
though
the
sunshine
was
as
brilliant
as
before
the
whole
universe
in
the
eyes
of
harry
vivian
the
young
goldsmith
seemed
plunged
into
a
profound
and
solemn
gloom
for
she
was
no
longer
where
he
yet
gazed
he
felt
oppressed
in
this
glittering
sunshine
which
had
no
light
for
him
and
he
drew
towards
the
outer
door
that
in
the
free
fresh
air
he
might
breathe
more
freely
as
he
gained
the
threshold
he
started
and
an
exclamation
of
surprise
escaped
his
lips
opposite
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
dwelt
the
young
girl
upon
whom
his
eyes
had
gazed
so
fondly
stood
a
man
who
in
costume
and
manner
was
the
reverse
of
prepossessing
who
was
he
and
what
could
he
want
there
were
questions
which
harry
at
once
put
to
himself
he
had
come
on
business
most
disagreeable
business
that
was
beyond
a
doubt
for
there
was
nothing
either
in
his
garb
or
in
his
manner
which
betrayed
the
idle
visitor
harry
therefore
conceived
it
to
be
his
especial
duty
with
rather
questionable
propriety
however
to
observe
his
movements
he
saw
the
man
examine
the
house
from
the
scraper
at
the
door
to
the
parapet
below
the
roof
and
then
make
a
peculiar
sign
to
some
person
or
persons
who
lying
prevented
harry
from
catching
a
glimpse
of
them
then
he
gave
a
treble
knock
at
the
door
facing
which
he
was
standing
young
vivian
did
not
like
that
knock
it
was
not
a
peal
of
three
distinct
knocks
for
a
lodger
nor
was
it
the
easy
of
a
genteel
visitor
no
it
was
a
bad
imitation
of
a
knock
followed
by
a
faltering
sneaking
tap
had
any
embarrassed
individual
accustomed
to
visits
from
or
heard
that
knock
and
caught
sight
of
that
man
at
his
door
he
would
have
instantly
implored
some
other
inmate
of
the
house
to
tell
the
visitor
that
he
had
sailed
to
the
furthest
extremity
of
the
hudson
bay
territory
and
would
never
be
home
again
the
fact
was
it
was
not
alone
that
the
knock
was
a
but
the
dress
also
loudly
proclaimed
the
purport
of
the
visits
he
paid
upon
his
head
slinking
down
to
his
eyebrows
was
a
hat
which
had
long
endured
severe
stress
of
weather
to
its
disadvantage
upon
his
body
and
that
was
his
mark
he
wore
a
loose
brown
great
coat
styled
by
advertising
tailors
sack
it
was
dirty
discoloured
much
worn
at
the
pockets
and
strongly
impregnated
with
the
odour
of
the
cheapest
and
rankest
tobacco
that
coat
worn
at
the
hottest
end
of
june
betrayed
him
it
was
his
a
child
brought
up
in
that
neighbourhood
would
have
told
you
by
that
coat
worn
in
the
height
of
summer
heats
the
nature
of
his
profession
the
young
goldsmith
on
seeing
him
held
his
breath
he
had
a
conviction
that
the
errand
would
of
necessity
prove
an
unpleasant
one
and
after
a
reflection
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
of
the
apparently
engaged
in
looking
up
and
down
the
street
but
he
never
took
his
eye
for
an
instant
off
the
man
in
the
dingy
brown
coat
that
individual
had
just
raised
his
extremely
dirty
fingers
to
repeat
the
offensive
knock
when
the
slowly
opened
and
an
elderly
man
presented
himself
is
her
father
muttered
the
young
goldsmith
retiring
within
his
shop
yet
only
a
few
paces
for
though
uninfluenced
by
any
meanly
inquisitive
motives
he
felt
constrained
to
watch
the
proceedings
of
the
shabby
personage
he
observed
the
wan
old
man
and
his
visitor
engaged
in
rather
a
vigorous
colloquy
conducted
with
brutal
coarseness
on
the
part
of
the
man
in
the
brown
coat
and
on
the
other
side
with
the
air
of
one
upon
whom
some
heavy
and
startling
demand
is
made
which
he
is
wholly
unprepared
or
unable
to
meet
after
some
extravagant
gestures
had
been
exhibited
by
both
persons
the
individual
in
the
dingy
brown
sack
abruptly
terminated
it
by
thrusting
rudely
back
the
old
man
springing
past
him
and
ascending
the
stairs
wringing
his
hands
with
a
distracted
aspect
the
old
man
staggered
after
him
the
quick
eye
of
harry
vivian
had
detected
the
agonised
bearing
of
the
old
man
during
the
whole
time
he
was
in
conversation
with
his
unwelcome
visitor
he
had
with
pain
perceived
the
emotion
of
horror
which
seemed
to
paralyse
his
limbs
as
he
tottered
up
the
stairs
after
the
dusky
fellow
and
with
nervous
apprehension
he
wondered
what
scene
was
then
being
enacted
in
the
apartments
above
was
that
fair
young
creature
present
in
all
human
probability
she
was
possibly
subjected
to
the
coarse
insults
of
the
unprepossessing
individual
who
had
forced
his
way
into
her
presence
the
teeth
of
the
youth
set
firmly
together
as
the
thought
intruded
itself
and
he
felt
that
it
would
prove
an
infinite
comfort
to
him
if
he
detected
the
vulgar
rascal
in
any
act
of
insolence
addressed
to
her
to
grip
him
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
fling
him
out
of
the
window
into
the
street
at
this
moment
old
harper
the
goldsmith
his
master
and
his
uncle
too
made
his
appearance
from
an
inner
workshop
young
vivian
who
was
racking
his
brain
for
a
scheme
which
should
enable
him
to
make
one
of
the
party
opposite
turned
quickly
to
him
and
said
sir
i
am
glad
you
have
come
in
there
is
the
silver
race
cup
from
which
ought
to
have
been
sent
to
the
it
has
been
overlooked
it
is
wanted
home
quickly
you
think
i
had
better
run
over
with
it
at
once
to
old
wilton
no
hal
sir
why
not
was
so
slow
over
the
last
things
we
gave
him
to
chase
you
ought
to
remember
that
hal
for
you
used
to
run
over
there
constantly
to
urge
him
on
you
hal
turned
suddenly
scarlet
do
continued
the
goldsmith
in
future
i
think
we
had
better
send
all
these
jobs
to
old
verity
at
the
back
of
the
sessions
the
perspiration
stood
in
small
globes
on
the
forehead
of
young
vivian
forget
sir
he
said
with
a
pleading
tone
wilton
has
been
long
in
failing
health
that
it
is
not
so
long
since
he
lost
his
wife
oh
sir
this
is
not
a
time
to
take
his
work
harper
gently
stroked
his
chin
no
hal
it
is
not
he
said
after
a
short
pause
at
the
same
time
his
unfortunate
position
is
not
an
excuse
we
can
offer
to
the
firms
who
employ
us
for
delay
in
the
work
with
which
we
are
entrusted
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
ourselves
to
allow
the
shortcomings
of
others
to
prove
the
occasion
of
loss
of
custom
to
i
will
answer
for
punctuality
this
time
urged
hal
eagerly
you
know
he
is
our
best
chaser
shall
i
run
over
with
it
and
impress
upon
him
that
it
is
wanted
as
soon
as
it
can
be
done
you
may
hal
said
the
goldsmith
remember
to
point
out
to
him
the
necessity
for
punctuality
assure
him
that
if
there
be
any
delay
over
the
completion
of
this
job
he
may
reckon
it
as
the
last
he
will
have
from
the
apprentice
with
a
pleased
smile
nodded
his
head
caught
up
the
cup
which
bore
upon
it
a
rare
example
of
his
own
skill
and
ran
out
of
the
shop
a
moment
more
and
a
sharp
ringing
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
dwelt
old
wilton
the
gold
chaser
another
moment
and
the
apprentice
stood
within
the
chamber
he
had
so
longed
to
enter
and
he
became
at
once
a
spectator
and
a
participator
in
a
painful
scene
the
sounds
of
angry
altercation
caught
his
ear
as
he
reached
the
room
door
the
gruff
tone
of
voice
of
the
unwelcome
guest
preponderating
acting
upon
and
animated
by
an
impulse
which
he
perhaps
would
not
have
cared
to
acknowledge
even
to
himself
he
did
not
pause
to
crave
admission
but
entered
the
room
without
displaying
the
courtesy
of
a
preliminary
knock
he
saw
before
him
old
wilton
and
facing
him
the
man
in
brown
they
were
at
high
words
on
the
appearance
of
hal
both
men
became
silent
and
fixed
their
eyes
intently
and
inquiringly
upon
him
they
waited
for
him
to
speak
the
apprentice
cast
his
eyes
quickly
round
the
room
but
the
maiden
he
hoped
to
see
was
not
there
and
he
drew
breath
he
perceived
that
he
was
expected
to
commence
the
conversation
and
clearing
his
voice
he
said
hurriedly
wilton
i
have
some
work
here
for
he
put
the
silver
cup
upon
the
table
it
will
require
your
nicest
skill
and
the
instructions
are
therefore
rather
elaborate
so
if
you
please
i
will
wait
until
you
are
disengaged
before
no
no
exclaimed
old
wilton
interrupting
him
snatching
up
the
cup
he
thrust
it
back
into
the
arms
of
young
vivian
it
away
take
it
away
he
added
almost
frantically
must
not
remain
here
now
no
no
no
not
asked
the
individual
in
the
loose
great
coat
sharply
speak
not
cried
wilton
hoarsely
glaring
at
him
and
then
turning
to
the
apprentice
he
ejaculated
with
great
excitement
go
i
beg
i
entreat
you
to
go
away
pray
young
sir
go
i
interposes
a
objection
intervened
the
former
speaker
and
turning
to
vivian
he
said
with
an
assumption
of
authority
be
so
kind
as
to
put
that
piece
plate
down
where
you
put
it
i
do
not
rejoined
vivian
sharply
turning
his
bright
eye
full
upon
the
speaker
with
an
expression
that
savoured
very
strongly
of
a
disposition
to
resist
the
dirty
man
did
not
like
the
language
it
spake
but
he
affected
not
to
be
influenced
by
the
threat
it
conveyed
he
answered
temperately
yet
impressively
is
what
i
suppose
look
here
young
you
know
me
my
jukes
it
might
have
been
snooks
or
wiggins
or
any
other
name
not
down
in
the
category
of
the
young
acquaintances
or
friends
the
indifference
he
displayed
on
hearing
it
could
not
be
greater
if
it
had
he
so
expressed
himself
for
which
jukes
rewarded
him
with
a
stare
of
astonishment
and
whistled
then
he
chuckled
in
luck
you
are
he
continued
then
you
are
young
werry
likely
know
me
better
some
day
a
certainly
the
youth
recognised
the
office
if
he
did
not
the
name
a
thrill
ran
through
his
frame
as
the
fellow
hissed
the
words
between
his
teeth
and
a
sound
like
a
low
wail
burst
from
the
lips
of
old
wilton
the
youth
turned
towards
him
his
bosom
swelling
with
the
generous
impulses
natural
to
his
age
and
in
tones
of
earnest
sincerity
he
exclaimed
i
in
any
way
aid
you
wilton
the
tone
the
look
the
gesture
of
the
youth
needed
nothing
to
commend
them
to
the
keen
appreciation
of
the
old
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
the
generous
proffer
fell
upon
his
ears
but
he
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
thank
you
master
vivian
he
said
you
can
not
help
me
no
you
can
not
aid
do
not
know
wilton
what
i
might
be
able
to
accomplish
if
you
would
give
me
the
opportunity
he
urged
no
replied
the
old
man
me
to
battle
it
out
with
this
man
as
best
i
leave
that
cup
afore
you
go
exclaimed
jukes
addressing
vivian
help
the
do
not
intend
to
go
yet
said
hal
vivian
when
i
do
believe
me
i
shall
take
no
instructions
from
you
about
the
destination
of
this
jukes
whistled
shrilly
by
the
united
aid
of
his
first
and
third
fingers
and
instantly
the
room
door
opened
a
couple
of
yet
shabbier
and
much
dirtier
personages

his
frame

asked

earnestly
jukes
raised
his
dirty

and
recklessly

plunged
into
a
fit
of
reflection
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
and
said
to
his
companions

obeyed

and
quitted

horrible
ejaculated
hal
with
a
glance
of
commiseration
at
the
old
man
who
with
downcast
eyes
and
set
teeth
was
listening
to
every
word
that
fell
from
the
lips
course
it
is
repeated
jukes
with
an
air
of
triumph

may
save

all
this
and
like
the
princesses
and
children

fairy
tales

and
there

a
free
man
agin
with
all
his
traps

young
vivian
approached

a
grave
one
wilton

said

simple
signature

two
heavy
thousand
pounds

jukes
elevating
his
voice
as

repeated
the
amount
of

the
old
man

ketch
of
eustace
wilton
there
sudds
and
you
nutty
begin
to
take
a
hinventory
of
these
had
the
men
thus
summoned
to
appear
indulged
themselves
while
outside
the
door
with
the
pastime
of
listening
at
the
keyhole
they
could
hardly
have
made
a
quicker
response
than
they
did
to
the
call
of
jukes
but
as
they
entered
the
room
by
one
door
a
young
girl
ran
into
it
by
another
and
cast
her
arms
about
the
old
neck
saying
in
an
affrighted
tone
dear
father
who
and
why
are
these
men
here
why
are
you
in
such
grief
the
old
man
sank
upon
a
seat
bowing
his
face
upon
the
table
and
burying
his
hands
in
his
gray
hair
he
sobbed
with
agony
the
girl
only
tightened
her
loving
embrace
and
turned
her
face
towards
the
ruffians
who
were
about
to
jest
at
the
situation
it
was
the
young
maiden
vivian
had
seen
at
the
window
seeming
like
a
golden
seraph
in
the
sunshine
when
jukes
perceived
the
exquisite
countenance
of
daughter
turned
with
an
aspect
of
distressed
inquiry
towards
him
he
instinctively
removed
the
hat
of
many
showers
from
his
dusty
head
and
made
her
a
slight
bow
his
satellites
also
approached
as
near
as
they
could
to
an
imitation
of
his
action
and
stood
still
instead
of
displaying
as
they
had
intended
a
vast
amount
of
unnecessary
activity
this
respect
was
an
instinctive
tribute
to
her
innocent
loveliness
purity
commands
reverence
even
as
beauty
does
admiration
vivian
felt
with
a
rising
in
the
throat
a
sudden
desire
to
produce
from
his
pocket
which
contained
but
a
very
few
shillings
several
thousand
pounds
with
which
to
pay
off
the
debt
and
then
an
almost
irresistible
inclination
to
trundle
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
the
three
fellows
whose
presence
created
so
much
misery
he
could
do
nothing
however
but
clear
his
voice
and
addressing
the
young
lady
say
is
a
most
unhappy
affair
miss
wilton
and
i
regret
very
sincerely
that
it
is
in
my
power
to
do
little
either
in
the
way
of
assistance
or
advice
but
with
your
permission
i
will
fetch
over
my
uncle
harper
he
possesses
vast
experience
and
no
doubt
he
will
show
us
a
way
out
of
this
maze
of
difficulty
and
he
did
not
wait
for
her
permission
but
running
across
the
road
returned
the
silver
cup
to
its
former
place
and
in
a
few
hurried
passionate
words
explained
to
his
uncle
what
had
occurred
he
succeeded
in
prevailing
on
him
to
return
with
him
to
apartments
in
some
vague
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
suggest
a
mode
by
which
the
old
man
might
be
saved
from
destruction
a
most
painful
scene
followed
the
appearance
of
harper
by
pertinent
questions
he
elicited
that
under
circumstances
which
could
not
then
be
explained
wilton
had
given
bonds
to
the
amount
of
two
thousand
pounds
that
those
bonds
were
that
he
had
been
sued
for
the
recovery
of
the
amount
that
judgment
had
been
obtained
against
him
and
that
execution
had
issued
but
withal
the
man
jukes
was
empowered
to
withdraw
arrest
and
execution
on
the
condition
that
wilton
signed
a
certain
document
which
jukes
then
had
in
his
possession
this
signature
wilton
sternly
and
inflexibly
refused
to
give
and
when
it
was
urged
upon
him
to
do
so
for
the
sake
of
her
who
was
wholly
dependent
upon
him
he
grew
frenzied
and
vowed
that
he
would
submit
to
death
rather
than
comply
harper
the
goldsmith
finding
that
reasoning
expostulations
suggestions
and
pleadings
were
alike
in
vain
said
there
was
no
way
to
save
him
and
matters
must
take
their
course
like
a
vulture
pouncing
upon
its
prey
jukes
seized
upon
the
almost
lifeless
old
man
and
proceeded
to
drag
him
away
his
daughter
clung
in
horrified
agony
to
him
in
truth
it
was
a
sad
and
painful
sight
it
was
scarcely
more
than
a
year
since
death
had
ruthlessly
torn
her
mother
from
this
fair
young
child
and
now
it
seemed
as
though
the
grim
tyrant
in
the
person
of
jukes
was
robbing
her
of
her
father
also
the
old
knees
trembled
and
his
quivered
as
though
he
had
been
smitten
with
the
palsy
he
embraced
his
daughter
with
frenzied
emotion
and
in
tones
of
passionate
grief
cried
my
own
my
beautiful
darling
i
leave
you
but
for
a
brief
time
bear
up
against
this
dreadful
visitation
as
bravely
as
you
can
my
girl
it
is
for
the
sake
of
your
brother
and
for
you
darling
that
i
endure
this
misery
but
have
trust
my
child
in
an
creator
happiness
will
come
to
us
again
some
day
my
child
some
will
do
my
best
dear
father
if
you
will
take
me
with
you
murmured
flora
through
her
blinding
tears
will
strive
to
be
brave
and
to
endure
patiently
and
calmly
but
oh
indeed
indeed
it
will
terrible
to
be
left
here
she
flung
herself
upon
his
neck
and
sobbed
bitterly
harper
coughed
a
watery
mist
shrouded
everything
from
the
sight
of
young
vivian
but
jukes
declaring
that
he
had
no
warrant
of
arrest
against
any
turned
spitefully
on
old
wilton
tore
him
from
the
agonised
embrace
of
his
weeping
child
and
bore
him
away
harper
followed
them
down
the
stairs
to
see
that
no
unnecessary
harshness
was
employed
in
conveying
the
trembling
prisoner
into
the
street
when
they
were
gone
flora
wilton
sank
into
a
chair
hal
approached
her
and
in
a
gentle
voice
he
said
to
her
brother
mark
and
i
were
intimate
friends
miss
wilton
before
he
went
abroad
will
you
not
also
look
upon
me
as
a
friend
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
do
much
yet
all
that
i
can
do
to
serve
you
shall
be
done
with
my
whole
heart
pray
believe
me
i
will
not
obtrude
upon
the
very
natural
grief
which
now
so
heavily
weighs
you
down
but
i
entreat
you
when
you
may
need
aid
not
to
forget
flora
rose
up
she
turned
her
large
beautiful
eyes
yet
more
lustrous
from
the
tears
which
filled
them
upon
him
and
with
a
quivering
lip
murmured
vivian
kindness
at
a
moment
like
this
is
doubly
valuable
it
has
a
language
which
of
late
has
been
very
very
strange
in
our
ears
and
now
that
that
he
he
is
gone
i
her
voice
gradually
became
inaudible
as
her
features
were
overspread
with
a
paleness
she
stretched
out
her
small
white
hand
as
though
to
feel
for
some
place
to
lean
upon
for
support
she
appeared
at
a
moment
to
have
been
stricken
with
blindness
she
tottered
swayed
to
and
fro
and
would
have
fallen
heavily
upon
the
ground
but
that
hal
with
a
sudden
cry
caught
her
in
his
strong
arms
and
saved
her
the
exclamation
uttered
by
vivian
attracted
the
attention
of
mr
nutty
he
was
making
out
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
in
the
room
and
had
just
written
down
in
a
penny
memorandum
book
cheers
tabbel
when
he
heard
the
same
voice
cry
for
some
water
quick
run
he
responded
instantly
be
blowed
i
go
for
no
water
the
man

the
worm
upon

tell
thee
what
my
friend
he
is
a
very
serpent
in
my
way

mine
doth
tread

shakspere
sunshine
still
sunbeams
making
a
golden
palace
of
a
gothic
mansion
in
the
park
gilding
its
fretted
roof
its
traceries
and
its
triple
arched
and
ornamented
windows
tinting
the
graceful
trees
which
gently
waved
in
the
gardens
before
and
behind
it
scattering
golden
stars
upon
the
lake
and
investing
the
flowers
and
shrubs
with
a
beauty
which
rendered
the
place
around
little
less
than
an
earthly
paradise
sunshine
and

in

a
room

furnished
containing
every
appliance
a
morbid
attention
to
personal
comfort

need
or
the
invention
of
luxurious
imagination
could
devise
were
seated
an
elderly
gentleman
his
wife
and
three
daughters
one
of
these
girls
was
a
beauty
all
had
pretensions
to
good
looks
but
she
was
strikingly
handsome
the
name
of
the
owner
of
this
mansion
was
grahame
he
was
a
pale
man
a
dress
suit
of
black
and
a
white
cravat
which
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
being
unpleasantly
and
rather
dangerously
tight
about
his
neck
added
to
the
austerity
of
his
aspect
his
wife
an
intensely
proud
woman
whose
pride
was
apparent
in
her
air
her
dress
her
features
sat
like
an
imperious
creature
whose
foible
had
no
other
quality
than
the
worst
species
of
haughtiness
like
the
very
frankest
person
in
the
world
she
wore
her
heart
upon
her
sleeve
and
displayed
its
entire
sentiment
in
the
material
of
which
her
attire
was
made
in
its
fashion
and
in
the
style
in
which
it
was
worn
the
jewellery
upon
her
wrists
her
arms
her
fingers
about
her
neck
and
at
her
waist
betrayed
the
only
feeling
of
which
she
was
capable
she
lived
moved
breathed
in
an
atmosphere
of
inordinate
unreasoning
pride
no
other
and
the
who
came
in
contact
with
her
felt
it
before
she
uttered
a
word
to
or
glanced
at
them
in
her
eyes
they
were
pottery
of
the
commonest
earthen
material
whilst
the
clay
of
which
she
was
herself
formed
produced
a
porcelain
of
the
rarest
kind
so
she
sat
to
be
looked
at
not
touched
her
husband
outwardly
was
of
the
same
stamp
within
he
was
begrimed
with
cowardly
meanness
granite
selfishness
a
cringing
obsequiousness
to
the
wealthy
and
the
powerful
and
an
icy
haughtiness
to
all
whom
he
understood
to
be
his
inferiors
in
position
by
his
standard
pride
was
measured
as
honour
and
nobility
of
soul
gold
as
the
essence
of
all
virtue
his
daughters
brought
up
under
such
guidance
could
hardly
fail
to
be
impregnated
with
the
principles
or
rather
lack
of
principle
by
which
their
parents
were
governed
yet
exercised
upon
the
youngest
their
influence
failed
to
win
a
proselyte
her
organisation
had
not
been
adapted
by
nature
to
receive
the
impressions
the
authors
of
her
being
laboured
to
create
and
therefore
when
she
hazarded
an
opinion
favourable
to
the
purest
sympathies
of
a
kindly
nature
or
displayed
an
emotion
which
betrayed
that
she
had
a
heart
she
was
called
a
fool
and
treated
as
a
pariah
by
the
whole
family
she
had
been
christened
evangeline
but
her
imperial
mamma
frequently
informed
her
it
was
a
misnomer
that
in
truth
her
name
should
have
been
gosling
which
she
had
somewhere
heard
meant
a
young
goose
truly
a
young
silly
goose
the
second
daughter
resembled
her
mother
in
all
things
was
in
fact
her
counterpart
she
even
bore
her
dualistic
name
margaret
claverhouse
and
like
her
maternal
parent
was
supremely
proud
and
hateful
in
all
her
characteristics
the
eldest
girl
the
beauty
of
the
family
was
composed
of
somewhat
discordant
elements
in
person
she
was
eminently
attractive
her
figure
was
tall
and
commanding
and
its
outline
was
as
graceful
as
its
air
was
majestic
her
face
as
we
have
said
was
extremely
beautiful
but
he
must
have
a
bold
heart
who
falling
in
love
with
it
would
woo
her
in
the
expectation
that
he
could
win
her
with
ease
and
retain
her
by
indifference
her
features
were
regular
her
eyes
large
glittering
and
of
that
deep
brown
which
is
often
mistaken
for
black
her
eyelids
were
full
and
her
eyelashes
so
long
as
really
to
form
a
fringe
to
the
lid
her
eyebrows
were
arched
her
hair
was
darker
than
her
eyes
and
not
less
brilliant
her
mouth
was
small
yet
it
had
a
sensual
fulness
no
less
apparent
then
the
scornful
curl
which
ever
seemed
to
keep
it
in
a
state
of
unrest
as
the
hand
of
her
maid
was
skilled
and
incessantly
in
requisition
the
arrangement
of
her
tresses
that
wondrous
ornament
to
woman
may
be
said
to
have
been
faultless
her
attire
was
admirably
chosen
to
assist
her
beauty
and
its
fit
was
a
triumph
of
the
art
her
mother
had
instilled
into
her
a
belief
that
she
was
a
queen
of
beauty
and
she
looked
thought
moved
as
though
she
were
an
empress
as
yet
it
was
supposed
that
her
affections
had
not
been
touched
from
infancy
she
had
been
tutored
to
believe
that
to
be
human
in
feeling
was
to
descend
to
the
level
of
the
common
herd
that
the
world
and
what
it
contained
were
made
for
her
not
she
for
the
world
she
was
gifted
with
all
the
elements
of
which
energy
and
passion
are
composed
and
she
was
capable
of
loving
with
a
force
not
often
allotted
even
to
woman
but
her
passions
her
energies
her
tenderness
had
been
rendered
dormant
by
the
counsels
of
worldly
pride
as
the
warm
gushing
stream
is
converted
by
a
slow
frost
into
a
silent
motionless
block
of
ice
should
there
come
before
her
eyes
the
man
whose
physical
beauty
and
whose
mental
intelligence
woke
up
her
heart
from
its
icy
dream
into
passionate
life
and
that
love
should
prove
to
be
unrequited
woe
woe
to
her
and
possibly
to
him
she
had
been
named
helen
after
a
maternal
relative
from
whom
the
most
exaggerated
expectations
were
entertained
and
she
bore
it
as
though
she
in
virtue
of
it
already
possessed
the
vast
inheritance
it
was
understood
to
foreshadow
this
family
were
engaged
while
the
broad
sunshine
was
gladdening
the
poor
and
the
respectable
promenading
in
the
park
into
which
the
windows
of
the
mansion
looked
in
discussing
the
conduct
of
the
only
son
of
the
house
of
grahame
who
instead
of
having
obtained
at
college
a
for
the
honour
of
the
family
had
forwarded
home
a
packet
of
accounts
the
gross
total
of
which
considerably
exceeded
the
handsome
allowance
placed
to
his
credit
by
his
father
grahame
spoke
with
considerable
dissatisfaction
of
the
course
his
son
must
have
pursued
to
have
plunged
thus
largely
into
debt
and
though
it
was
in
accordance
with
his
wish
that
his
son
had
for
his
college
companions
and
intimate
acquaintances
the
duke
of
allborne
the
young
earl
of
carlton
and
the
experienced
lord
suedmuch
yet
he
thought
that
even
their
intimacy
at
the
price
his
son
had
paid
for
it
or
rather
that
which
was
called
upon
to
pay
much
too
dear
and
he
expressed
himself
on
the
subject
with
an
emphasis
which
his
pride
rendered
unusual
grahame
turned
upon
him
a
sidelong
glance
with
her
eyes
and
said
coldly
and
contemptuously
is
a
grahame
the
members
of
that
race
are
not
used
to
measure
their
wants
their
pleasures
or
even
their
caprices
by
miserable
considerations
of
economy
i
said
to
malcolm
when
we
parted
always
that
you
are
a
grahame
if
those
with
whom
you
associate
act
as
though
their
wealth
ran
a
stream
whose
source
is
inexhaustible
let
your
expenditure
be
no
less
illimitable
than
theirs
even
to
represent
in
wealth
a
river
is
a
sea
of
dissipation
and
of
debt
sharply
exclaimed
grahame
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
out
of
a
gold
grahame
your
sense
of
the
dignity
of
your
position
is
becoming
impaired
responded
the
stately
lady
wholly
closing
her
eyes
madam
he
returned
me
i
simply
object
to
unnecessary
and
preposterous
an
expression
of
ineffable
disdain
passed
over
the
features
grahame
she
remarked
in
a
frigid
tone
you
at
a
moment
become
poor
the
face
of
grahame
instantly
changed
to
a
brilliant
scarlet
hue
then
to
a
purple
finally
it
became
livid
globules
of
cold
perspiration
gathered
thickly
upon
his
brow
he
thrust
his
chair
back
a
few
paces
and
there
was
something
of
an
affrighted
expression
in
his
eyes
as
he
gazed
upon
hen
her
eyelids
were
yet
close
down
over
her
pale
gray
eyes
as
he
wiped
the
deathly
damp
from
his
brow
helen
grahame
turned
her
bright
dark
eyes
upon
him
with
a
scornful
look
in
her
estimation
the
concentration
of
meanness
of
soul
was
to
place
a
limit
upon
lavish
expenditure
she
did
not
utter
a
word
but
she
tried
to
balance
in
her
own
mind
which
of
the
two
occasioned
her
father
the
most
terror
her
cold
displeasure
or
extravagance
margaret
thought
with
her
sister
that
economy
was
but
another
word
for
a
despicable
narrowness
of
soul
not
but
that
she
was
economical
enough
when
called
upon
for
an
exercise
of
charity
but
for
any
selfish
purpose
a
compulsory
contraction
of
expenditure
would
have
been
regarded
by
her
as
an
example
of
the
lowest
and
most
vulgar
niggardliness
she
listened
with
disdain
to
her
parent
and
thought
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
her
father
to
give
like
a
grahame
in
order
that
her
brother
malcolm
should
lavish
it
like
a
grahame
evangeline
to
whom
the
conversation
had
been
distressing
observing
that
her
father
had
become
suddenly
silent
raised
her
soft
eyes
and
marked
the
expression
that
passed
over
his
features
in
alarm
she
hastily
left
her
seat
and
in
a
low
affectionate
tone
said
as
she
took
his
hand
and
leaned
over
him
sir
you
are
not
well
you
are
agitated
can
your
seat
evangeline
he
exclaimed
hoarsely
as
he
drew
his
hand
from
her
petulantly
am
not
agitated
i
am
well
you
are
obtrusive
and
evangeline
retreated
to
her
place
at
the
window
she
took
up
the
embroidery
on
which
she
had
been
engaged
and
went
on
with
it
in
silence
but
a
tear
dropped
upon
her
work
no
one
heeding
the
silly
goose
it
passed
unnoticed
grahame
spoke
again
is
coming
home
she
said
he
has
invited
two
of
his
college
companions
the
young
duke
of
allborne
and
the
honourable
lester
vane
to
accompany
him
here
on
a
visit
no
doubt
grahame
you
will
not
lose
so
valuable
an
opportunity
to
impress
upon
your
son
in
the
presence
of
his
spendthrift
associates
that
your
narrow
income
forbids
your
meeting
claims
interrupted
grahame
tartly
is
you
who
are
losing
a
sense
of
your
position
now
let
us
change
the
subject
i
will
speak
with
malcolm
upon
his
return
a
proper
maintenance
of
his
position
and
the
honour
of
his
house
is
one
thing
a
disreputable
squandering
of
his
income
quite
another
in
that
spirit
i
speak
now
in
that
spirit
will
i
address
myself
to
is
the
honourable
lester
vane
inquired
margaret
grahame
of
her
mother
young
man
of
an
ancient
and
high
family
replied
grahame
very
handsome
exclaimed
helen
adding
at
least
malcolm
writes
me
he
praises
him
highly
declares
that
he
possesses
great
personal
attractions
and
is
sure
i
we
shall
all
like
him
did
not
name
him
in
the
few
lines
he
wrote
to
me
said
margaret
he
did
to
you
eva
did
he
not
remarked
helen
turning
her
brilliant
eyes
with
a
mocking
glance
upon
her
youngest
sister
a
gush
of
tears
came
again
into
the
eyes
of
evangeline
she
did
not
raise
them
from
her
employment
that
her
emotion
might
be
seen
by
her
sisters
she
answered
with
a
quivering
lip
and
in
a
low
faltering
tone
suppose
malcolm
had
not
time
to
write
to
me
i
have
had
no
letter
from
him
since
he
has
been
margaret
smiled
she
was
not
accustomed
to
laugh
absurd
do
you
think
he
would
write
to
you
what
conceit
she
observed
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
what
other
feeling
should
she
entertain
for
a
sister
who
possessed
merely
the
cardinal
virtues
and
was
utterly
deficient
in
an
appreciation
of
worldly
pomps
and
vanities
at
this
part
of
the
conversation
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
it
opened
at
the
same
moment
and
an
individual
attired
in
a
suit
of
black
of
the
most
approved
court
dress
cut
advanced
into
the
room
the
eyes
of
the
family
were
turned
upon
him
but
he
scarcely
appeared
to
be
disposed
to
collapse
under
that
honour
his
neck
was
garnished
with
an
unexceptionable
cravat
which
was
arranged
with
such
precision
that
it
seemed
to
be
wrought
in
alabaster
and
carved
elaborately
his
wig
for
as
he
confessed
to
admiring
he
had
dispensed
with
his
looked
as
though
it
had
been
subjected
to
a
severe
storm
of
whitewash
and
had
been
violently
brushed
he
approached
his
master
and
bending
over
him
said
in
a
confidential
manner
yet
with
a
gesture
of
grave
but
humble
deference
pesson
is
come
sir
what
person
inquired
grahame
with
the
air
of
one
who
denied
the
right
of
any
to
seek
an
audience
with
him
pesson
concerning
which
you
gave
me
sir
i
asked
into
the
libree
my
library
man
cried
grahame
rising
up
angrily
what
does
the
fellow
mean
how
dare
you
ask
any
into
my
library
without
my
instructions
to
that
effect
said
he
were
chewkle
sir
and
if
you
please
to
the
face
of
grahame
turned
as
pale
as
death
and
then
changed
to
an
intense
crimson
yes
yes
yes
yes
he
cried
hurriedly
altering
his
tone
to
him
say
i
will
come
to
him
the
man
bowed
and
quitted
the
room
grahame
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
sunlight
it
lay
upon
the
grassy
lawn
upon
the
sloping
meads
upon
the
waving
trees
like
gleaming
gold
dust
the
soft
breeze
made
the
leaves
flutter
merrily
birds
darted
to
and
fro
in
the
clear
air
singing
gaily
and
brilliantly
attired
ladies
and
children
moved
over
the
open
places
in
the
broad
park
animated
by
the
beauty
of
the
scene
and
the
glory
of
the
sunshine
grahame
looked
distastefully
upon
it
it
with
the
feelings
at
war
within
his
breast
and
he
turned
from
it
with
an
impatient
exclamation
he
set
his
teeth
together
drew
a
long
breath
and
with
his
features
more
pallid
than
usual
strode
out
of
the
room
grahame
too
much
occupied
with
visions
of
her
own
dignity
when
she
thought
at
all
which
was
not
often
took
no
notice
of
the
disturbed
manner
of
her
husband
if
she
had
seen
it
she
would
not
have
credited
the
evidence
of
her
own
eyes
a
grahame
disturbed
or
agitated
the
thing
was
impossible
neither
did
helen
who
was
sketching
fancy
portraits
of
the
honourable
lester
vane
nor
margaret
who
was
not
even
troubled
by
an
effort
of
imagination
observe
him
but
evangeline
perceived
his
inward
perturbation
and
not
daring
to
offer
a
word
or
breathe
a
hope
that
she
might
aid
in
alleviating
it
sat
sadly
at
her
needlework
filled
with
a
foreboding
that
something
foreshadowed
trial
and
affliction
to
the
house
grahame
descended
to
his
library
in
one
corner
of
it
upon
the
edge
of
a
chair
under
which
his
hat
was
placed
sat
with
his
knees
close
together
and
his
toes
poised
on
the
floor
a
strange
looking
personage
a
sort
of
hybrid
between
a
fast
clerk
and
an
undertaker
it
was
chewkle
chewkle
was
an
agent
a
commission
agent
he
undertook
any
description
of
business
no
matter
what
he
sold
coals
and
coffee
he
introduced
distracted
tradesmen
to
usurious
he
offered
two
shillings
and
sixpence
in
the
pound
to
indignant
creditors
for
unhappy
insolvents
he
would
supply
you
with
a
good
article
in
tea
at
two
and
eight
he
raised
money
on
mortgage
and
having
a
friend
who
did
that
sort
of
thing
for
spendthrifts
who
needed
it
he
laid
out
money
on
fancy
horses
for
fast
individuals
with
imaginary
though
the
horses
he
backed
for
them
were
rarely
landed
winners
at
the
post
he
knew
all
the
good
investments
in
mines
and
would
obtain
shares
for
anybody
at
a
comparatively
low
price
though
some
day
they
be
at
fabulous
premiums
he
but
he
would
undertake
anything
whatever
clean
or
dirty
if
paid
his
commission
and
no
questions
when
the
remunerator
was
liberal
he
rose
up
as
grahame
entered
and
made
him
a
bow
morning
chewkle
said
grahame
loftily
what
success
got
our
man
safe
sir
he
replied
with
a
feeble
grin
the
family
the
apartments
sir
but
we
shall
move
the
goods
for
sale
by
the
sheriff
and
then
they
must
go
out
you
know
the
the
streets
sir
or
the
no
resources
as
i
then
of
course
he
has
signed
the
undertaking
a
not
yet
he
will
afraid
not
grahame
had
seated
himself
with
the
air
of
a
mogul
emperor
giving
audience
to
a
hindoo
slave
he
rose
to
his
feet
as
if
a
had
been
discharged
at
him
nonsense
he
cried
with
fierce
astonishment
such
pressure
the
man
can
not
possibly
he
does
sir
and
swears
he
will
not
sign
if
he
has
to
starve
and
rot
in
grahame
passed
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
gulped
as
if
he
would
choke

to
be
done
he
asked
without
it
sir
suggested
chewkle
mildly
his
signature
must
be
to
the
sir
said
chewkle
slowly
and
looking
carefully
round
the
room
to
see
that
no
other
person
was
present
it
may
be
there
on
the
grahame
looked
at
him
steadfastly
he
asked
chewkle
reduced
his
voice
to
a
whisper
have
got
his
name
on
a
letter
i
sir
very
difficult
to
write
like
it
i
exclaimed
grahame
with
dilated
eyes
do
you
counsel
sir
i
merely
suggests
that
if
the
signature
must
be
there
on
the
deed
no
obstinate
old
fool
should
prevent
its
being
placed
there
and
where
money
is
not
a
hobject
it
can
easily
be
teeth
chattered
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
transported
into
a
frosty
atmosphere
he
said
grimly
you
know
what
the
law
declares
such
an
act
to
be
chewkle
nodded
with
perfect
must
be
done
sir
he
rejoined
emphatically
position
depends
on
it
you
must
balance
beggary
destitution
ruin
against
rank
fortune
groaned
grahame
sinking
into
his
chair
and
pressing
his
hands
over
his
eyes
chapter
possession
disturbed
you
are
welcome
take
your
place
are
you
acquainted
with
the
difference
that
holds
this
present
question
in
the
court
i
am
informed
thoroughly
of
the
cause
which
is
the
merchant
here
and
which
is
the
jew
shakspere
in
the
dreams
of
harry
vivian
the
delicate
form
and
sweet
smiling
face
of
flora
wilton
had
appeared
to
him
and
not
unfrequently
but
then
she
seemed
ever
to
be
some
queen
of
faëryland
seated
on
a
throne
of
gems
of
dazzling
brilliancy
in
floral
realms
of
more
exquisite
beauty
than
mortal
eye
had
ever
beheld
on
earth
or
waking
fancy
in
its
most
gorgeous
development
could
conceive
in
his
moments
of
romantic
imaginings
when
his
mind
was
filled
with
her
beauty
he
certainly
had
sketched
a
few
scenes
comprising
events
in
which
both
he
and
flora
figured
still
his
ardent
imagination
had
not
carried
him
beyond
the
presentation
of
a
flower
and
the
reward
for
the
gift
with
which
the
soft
grateful
look
from
eyes
the
loveliest
in
the
world
would
enrich
him
he
had
never
foreshadowed
a
time
for
true
love
is
ever
subdued
in
action
by
the
most
genuine
modesty
when
he
should
within
his
arms
press
to
his
throbbing
heart
the
form
which
had
in
his
eyes
no
equal
or
that
the
face
so
rare
in
its
perfection
should
recline
upon
his
shoulder
close
to
his
lips
yet
so
it
chanced
to
be
circumstances
he
could
have
never
shaped
had
come
to
pass
and
the
bliss
of
entwining
his
arms
about
the
small
delicate
waist
of
flora
wilton
was
bestowed
upon
him
at
a
moment
the
most
unexpected
when
he
was
unprepared
to
welcome
it
and
unable
to
enjoy
it
nay
rather
than
bliss
the
emotion
he
experienced
might
be
said
to
have
been
one
of
terror
not
without
its
gratification
it
is
true
for
he
would
not
have
resigned
her
senseless
as
she
was
to
another
for
worlds
still
the
deathly
hue
with
which
her
features
were
overspread
the
compressed
lips
the
closed
eye
from
which
a
tear
had
struggled
and
disengaging
itself
lodged
yet
upon
her
cheek
made
him
fear
that
the
frightful
visitation
which
had
so
suddenly
fallen
upon
her
was
a
calamity
greater
than
her
gentle
nature
was
able
to
sustain
he
grew
himself
cold
and
faint
as
the
supposition
crossed
him
that
unless
some
sudden
and
energetic
measures
were
adopted
she
would
pass
from
her
swoon
into
the
unawakening
sleep
of
death
unacquainted
with
anything
pertaining
to
fainting
fits
and
under
a
strong
impression
that
swooning
and
giving
up
the
ghost
were
synonymous
his
calls
for
water
and
for
aid
merged
from
the
vehement
into
the
frantic
he
unheeded
the
representations
made
by
mr
nutty
that
men
in
possession
never
quit
the
sight
of
goods
placed
in
their
charge
until
the
amount
they
represent
is
satisfied
he
threatened
him
most
fiercely
for
not
flying
to
execute
his
commands
but
at
the
close
of
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
agitation
he
found
flora
yet
senseless
in
his
arms
and
mr
nutty
dancing
and
declaiming
vowing
that
he
would
take
the
of
willin
as
strove
to
hinterrupt
him
in
his
in
the
midst
of
this
harangue
by
mr
nutty
upon
the
majesty
of
his
professional
avocation
the
door
of
the
apartment
opened
and
a
young
girl
glided
in
she
had
met
old
wilton
on
the
stairs
in
custody
of
the
officers
and
had
seen
him
borne
away
she
had
loitered
outside
of
the
door
of
the
apartment
she
heard
the
low
sobbing
wail
of
the
afflicted
girl
whose
tears
were
wrung
from
her
by
the
terrifying
conviction
that
her
destruction
was
involved
in
the
loss
of
her
father
she
heard
too
the
calls
of
vivian
together
with
the
angry
colloquy
between
him
and
nutty
and
then
she
decided
on
offering
her
assistance
she
was
only
a
maker
working
for
a
wholesale
house
in
the
city
producing
the
fronts
worn
inside
bonnets
for
sevenpence
halfpenny
per
dozen
she
rose
at
six
in
the
morning
and
worked
until
twelve
at
night
in
order
to
complete
two
dozen
per
diem
out
of
the
sum
thus
realized
weekly
she
had
to
live
pay
her
lodging
and
find
herself
in
clothes
so
she
had
not
much
time
on
her
hands
nor
much
money
in
her
pocket
and
was
what
the
world
calls
a
person
of
no
importance
but
she
had
a
heart
a
gentle
compassionate
loving
heart
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
though
her
complexion
was
something
wan
and
her
eyelids
were
rather
tinged
with
pink
but
if
these
appearances
detracted
something
from
her
prettiness
what
did
they
not
add
to
the
interest
and
the
sympathy
raised
in
the
beholder
they
told
of
early
rising
and
midnight
toil
the
rapid
wearing
out
of
young
and
beautiful
human
life
so
that
thousands
of
thoughtless
beings
of
her
own
sex
might
set
off
to
advantage
their
facial
attractions
not
to
lengthen
this
digression
for
we
shall
know
much
more
of
this
young
damsel
by
and
by
lotte
clinton
for
that
was
her
name
hearing
the
cry
of
young
vivian
for
water
entered
the
apartment
prepared
to
offer
her
services
if
they
were
likely
to
be
required
she
saw
flora
wilton
lying
in
the
arms
of
hal
vivian
whose
handsome
face
she
recognised
in
an
instant
for
she
had
often
observed
it
from
her
garret
window
upturned
to
the
house
in
which
she
dwelt
though
his
look
reached
not
so
high
as
where
she
sat
peering
behind
her
mignionette
and
nasturtiums
hal
knew
her
not
but
just
now
she
made
her
appearance
to
his
conception
as
an
angel
newly
come
from
paradise
he
turned
his
eager
eyes
upon
her
wilton
is
in
deep
affliction
he
said
quickly
has
fainted
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
bring
some
water
her
in
a
chair
said
lotte
softly
will
be
better
there
she
will
have
more
air
i
will
run
for
water
and
my
smelling
salts
sometimes
at
night
i
grow
faint
and
dizzy
and
can
not
see
my
work
and
they
relieve
me
then
she
said
this
as
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
poor
girl
she
had
but
too
often
had
occasion
to
use
the
stimulant
for
the
purpose
she
named
vivian
almost
unconsciously
felt
a
reluctance
to
resign
his
beautiful
burden
but
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
course
proposed
by
lotte
was
the
proper
one
to
be
adopted
therefore
he
placed
the
yet
lifeless
flora
with
the
tenderest
carefulness
upon
a
chair
and
supported
her
drooping
head
upon
his
breast
lotte
swift
of
foot
had
not
been
a
minute
obtaining
the
ammoniacal
salts
and
a
teacup
with
water
in
it
she
did
not
possess
a
tumbler
for
she
could
not
afford
herself
beer
and
the
water
she
took
at
her
dinner
or
supper
when
she
could
afford
to
indulge
in
the
latter
luxury
was
as
sweet
to
her
out
of
a
cup
as
a
glass
she
set
to
work
as
a
woman
almost
instinctively
proceeds
in
these
matters
while
she
had
all
that
tender
sympathy
and
commiseration
which
the
condition
of
flora
could
elicit
from
any
one
imbued
with
a
generous
susceptibility
she
was
endowed
also
with
that
species
of
calm
and
firm
collectedness
so
valuable
in
emergencies
where
human
life
is
at
stake
she
set
vivian
to
work
bathing
with
the
cool
water
the
white
temples
from
which
his
trembling
fingers
had
parted
the
long
waving
hair
while
she
herself
applied
the
ammonia
to
the
nostrils
of
flora
and
chafed
her
palms
when
the
inhalation
had
done
its
work
thus
assaulted
nature
returned
to
its
duty
and
reasserted
its
claims
over
the
motionless
system
of
the
young
girl
who
gradually
opened
her
eyes
gazing
wildly
about
her
she
abruptly
rose
up
from
her
seat
as
though
she
had
awakened
out
of
some
painful
dream
the
faces
of
vivian
and
lotte
seemed
to
confuse
her
but
when
her
large
sad
eyes
fell
upon
the
unattractive
countenance
of
mr
nutty
turned
upon
her
with
an
aspect
in
which
the
expression
was
undecided
as
he
was
not
certain
whether
the
swoon
was
a
sham
or
a
fact
memory
returned
and
her
bereavement
with
the
future
and
all
the
horrors
of
its
uncertainty
save
that
the
direst
poverty
must
attend
it
burst
upon
her
she
wrung
her
hands
in
the
fulness
of
her
misery
and
then
she
murmured
through
her
blinding
tears
father
support
me
now
lotte
stole
her
arm
about
waist
and
whispered
in
her
ear
up
miss
wilton
you
have
friends
who
will
not
desert
she
asked
bitterly
know
of
no
relative
save
my
father
and
my
brother
my
father
is
in
prison
my
brother
is
far
far
away
and
i
am
a
homeless
helpless
hopeless
hopeless
exclaimed
vivian
not
say
that
miss
wilton
remember
that
i
have
told
you
mark
and
i
were
friends
before
he
went
away
i
know
him
so
well
that
i
believe
if
any
near
and
dear
relative
of
mine
were
during
my
absence
to
fall
into
trouble
and
affliction
he
would
be
the
first
to
come
forward
and
help
her
and
as
his
friend
what
he
would
do
that
ought
i
to
do
i
make
no
boast
but
oh
miss
wilton
do
not
fear
but
that
i
will
do
my
best
and
that
at
least
you
shall
not
be
helpless
nor
homeless
while
i
can
command
a
shilling
and
have
strength
to
work
for
you
are
a
dear
fellow
and
make
me
foolish
enough
to
cry
and
i
wish
you
said
lotte
her
eyes
suffused
with
tears
likewise
you
are
young
and
green
thought
mr
nutty
as
he
put
down
in
his
inventory
large
spewn
chimblee
ornymint
and
flora
with
eyes
beaming
with
gratitude
proffered
her
hand
to
vivian
who
took
it
and
pressed
it
it
would
have
been
a
dear
delight
to
him
to
have
kissed
it
but
he
felt
that
this
was
not
a
time
for
such
a
display
of
gallantry
or
feeling
know
not
how
to
thank
you
vivian
she
said
in
trembling
accents
i
fear
i
can
not
while
i
sincerely
appreciate
your
generous
offers
of
assistance
to
me
avail
myself
of
them
your
friendship
for
my
brother
gives
to
me
no
claim
upon
your
aid
neither
does
it
entitle
me
to
accept
it
and
guided
by
the
precepts
and
counsels
my
dear
father
has
implanted
in
my
mind
i
seem
clearly
to
comprehend
that
it
would
be
may
i
say
an
indiscretion
were
i
to
act
otherwise
than
in
most
grateful
terms
to
decline
what
your
disinterested
generosity
has
prompted
you
to
propose
i
confess
that
i
have
been
terribly
shocked
and
shaken
by
what
has
occurred
but
the
nervous
tremor
i
at
this
moment
endure
will
pass
away
and
i
shall
look
with
fervent
faith
to
a
brighter
and
green
too
thought
mr
nutty
and
placed
in
his
inventory
immidge
a
figgur
of
lotte
interposed
as
hal
with
rather
a
disconcerted
aspect
was
about
to
urge
her
acceptance
of
his
renewed
offer
us
see
vivian
she
said
to
him
tomorrow
will
bring
forth
at
present
everything
is
in
confusion
by
we
shall
know
the
worst
what
can
be
done
and
what
there
will
remain
to
do
then
miss
wilton
will
be
better
able
to
judge
in
what
you
can
be
of
service
to
her
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
will
feel
less
reluctance
to
accept
the
kindly
aid
you
have
offered
in
such
a
friendly
and
worthy
manner
sensible
girl
that
thought
mr
nutty
for
her
too
be
bound
he
put
down
at
the
same
moment
in
his
inventory
peece
of
clokk
wurk
wownd
up
and
goen
nutmy
graytur
coles
hal
seeing
that
the
advice
tendered
by
lotte
clinton
was
acceptable
to
flora
resolved
to
follow
it
and
turning
to
the
former
he
said
understand
far
better
than
i
do
the
way
to
manage
in
such
a
matter
as
this
i
am
only
anxious
to
be
of
service
and
my
intention
is
sincere
i
may
by
a
want
of
tact
produce
an
effect
entirely
opposite
to
that
which
i
most
desire
you
are
intelligent
and
good
natured
you
said
lotte
with
a
laugh
are
he
repeated
i
fancy
you
interpret
justly
my
am
sure
i
do
she
answered
promptly
i
place
myself
in
your
hands
you
will
not
leave
miss
wilton
for
the
present
he
added
for
a
minute
she
replied
are
all
that
i
could
hope
you
to
be
he
rejoined
if
i
can
help
you
you
will
send
for
me
you
i
will
responded
lotte
he
cried
miss
wilton
keep
up
your
spirits
matters
are
at
their
worst
they
mend
you
know
and
surely
your
affairs
could
hardly
be
in
a
more
unhappy
predicament
than
at
this
moment
preserve
your
faith
in
the
goodness
of
god
and
do
not
despair
of
the
flora
could
not
reply
she
could
only
return
the
pressure
of
his
hand
and
then
hide
her
face
upon
the
neck
of
lotte
clinton
hal
then
breathed
a
few
words
into
the
ear
of
nutty
to
the
effect
that
though
he
was
an
officer
of
the
law
engaged
in
one
of
its
most
unpleasant
duties
it
was
quite
possible
for
him
to
do
his
gently
but
that
if
he
should
entertain
a
contrary
opinion
and
offer
or
attempt
to
offer
to
carry
out
in
a
spirit
of
hostility
arrogance
and
coarseness
the
part
he
had
to
perform
he
might
prepare
himself
for
a
reckoning
the
settlement
of
which
would
not
be
in
his
favour
nutty
was
too
old
a
hand
at
his
craft
not
to
know
that
it
was
best
to
be
civil
when
as
he
in
rather
free
terms
said
was
summat
hanging
to
it
or
to
hesitate
to
be
a
brute
when
the
utter
poverty
of
the
poor
creatures
whose
goods
were
seized
rendered
even
his
possession
money
a
question
of
doubt
in
the
present
case
he
very
sagaciously
saw
that
if
he
acted
in
an
apparently
compassionate
and
considerate
spirit
to
the
daughter
of
old
wilton
and
took
care
to
let
his
behaviour
come
to
the
ears
of
young
vivian
his
purse
would
be
rendered
all
the
heavier
by
it
but
if
he
adopted
an
abrupt
harshness
of
manner
terrified
her
and
permitted
her
to
save
no
little
trinket
upon
which
she
set
some
priceless
personal
value
he
might
get
a
inflicted
with
no
light
or
unwilling
hand
he
took
therefore
the
suggestion
of
vivian
in
good
part
winked
his
eyes
significantly
jerked
his
thumb
over
his
left
shoulder
placed
his
thumb
to
his
nose
fluttered
his
fingers
and
otherwise
bewildered
the
apprentice
who
could
only
presume
that
these
evolutions
meant
that
his
wishes
should
be
complied
with
he
therefore
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
not
only
to
seem
to
comprehend
them
but
to
so
far
imitate
them
by
slapping
his
pocket
tapping
the
palm
of
his
hand
with
one
finger
and
pointing
to
nutty
so
as
to
give
that
grubby
individual
to
understand
that
if
he
behaved
kindly
there
be
something
to
nutty
smiled
complacently
bent
the
most
philanthropic
and
benevolent
of
glances
upon
flora
nodded
his
head
and
murmured
with
a
slight
grin
knows
all
about
thus
assured
harry
vivian
waved
his
hand
towards
flora
up
your
spirits
he
cried
will
go
right
then
with
an
effort
he
quitted
the
room
ran
lightly
down
the
stairs
and
was
soon
in
his
private
room
engaged
with
him
in
earnest
conversation
in
the
meantime
lotte
busied
herself
at
the
sacrifice
of
at
least
a
dozen
cap
fronts
or
rather
half
a
dozen
hours
to
be
replaced
by
six
taken
out
of
those
devoted
by
her
during
the
week
to
sleep
in
conferring
with
flora
as
to
the
course
she
would
have
to
pursue
when
all
the
furniture
was
swept
away
and
she
was
left
penniless
and
destitute
you
no
relations
in
london
inquired
lotte
if
you
have
only
one
or
two
i
will
pop
on
my
bonnet
and
mantle
and
run
to
them
very
quickly
let
them
be
who
they
may
they
would
surely
afford
you
some
never
heard
my
father
speak
even
of
one
in
london
or
elsewhere
returned
flora
have
lived
very
secluded
while
here
we
have
not
always
lived
thus
i
can
remember
dwelling
in
a
large
house
with
beautiful
furniture
mirrors
chandeliers
and
gorgeous
decorations
lovely
gardens
with
fountains
and
flowers
but
that
is
long
long
ago
i
know
not
when
i
know
not
why
we
left
it
or
when
or
how
we
came
here
it
seems
to
me
that
i
awakened
from
a
dream
of
faëryland
to
find
myself
in
these
poor
apartments
and
my
poor
father
destroying
his
life
by
the
deadly
closeness
of
his
application
to
his
know
then
of
no
relations
you
could
ask
to
help
you
said
lotte
replied
flora
friends
whose
assistance
you
might
ask
flora
shook
her
head
you
any
money
to
go
on
with
little
which
for
safety
is
i
want
to
know
nothing
about
it
interposed
mr
nutty
abruptly
here
when
i
put
down
in
my
any
harticle
you
touch
it
arterwards
leastwise
you
must
give
it
up
as
put
it
down
but
you
know
you
can
do
as
you
like
with
anything
as
i
put
down
do
you
tumble
mr
nutty
having
rather
a
mean
opinion
of
the
worldly
experience
of
flora
addressed
his
speech
to
lotte
but
that
young
lady
who
had
a
shrewd
guess
at
the
intention
sought
to
be
conveyed
in
the
first
speech
did
not
comprehend
quite
clearly
the
last
sentence
unless
as
she
conceived
the
man
had
a
notion
that
her
professional
avocation
was
dancing
on
horseback
and
leaping
through
hoops
or
over
poles
held
by
colonels
in
the
army
of
the
emperor
of
the
brazils
she
therefore
thanked
him
for
the
suggestion
he
offered
but
at
the
same
time
mystified
him
by
informing
him
that
she
had
never
been
on
horseback
in
her
life
in
a
few
whispers
she
made
flora
understand
meaning
and
suggested
that
if
there
happened
to
be
any
article
to
which
she
attached
any
particular
value
now
was
the
time
to
transfer
it
to
a
place
of
safety
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
mr
nutty
flora
hesitated
to
avail
herself
of
the
offer
not
so
lotte
is
my
room
she
said
one
can
enter
it
unless
i
please
i
have
the
key
you
can
put
anything
you
like
within
it
and
i
should
like
to
see
any
one
dare
to
come
in
and
attempt
to
take
it
still
flora
hesitated
people
seem
to
have
the
power
to
take
all
she
observed
if
they
are
justly
entitled
to
their
claim
it
would
be
an
act
of
dishonesty
to
keep
anything
back
from
dear
exclaimed
lotte
know
that
they
are
justly
entitled
and
therefore
you
have
the
right
to
assume
that
they
are
not
they
act
at
all
events
like
brutes
and
that
is
why
believe
they
have
no
more
right
to
a
single
thing
here
than
i
have
so
i
should
act
just
as
if
they
had
not
now
i
will
tell
you
what
my
advice
is
you
point
out
to
me
what
you
in
your
heart
should
like
to
save
and
leave
the
rest
to
a
sensible
gal
muttered
nutty
as
he
entered
in
his
inventory
a
arm
chare
and
floured
at
this
moment
there
was
a
gentle
knock
at
the
room
door
and
mr
nutty
opened
it
about
two
inches
and
peered
through
want
said
he
gruffly
to
some
one
without
clinton
is
she
here
asked
a
pleasant
voice
without
know
her
live
here
said
nutty
slamming
the
door
to
lotte
screamed
it
open
the
door
she
cried
is
my
brother
in
an
instant
she
put
nutty
aside
opened
the
door
and
putting
her
head
out
said
hastily
in
charley
i
am
so
glad
you
are
then
followed
a
sound
as
of
the
chirruping
of
young
sparrows
it
was
charley
and
lotte
performing
the
usual
act
of
grace
on
meeting
each
other
it
being
customary
for
the
pair
to
kiss
a
dozen
times
in
rapid
succession
a
quick
fire
painful
only
to
those
who
participate
lotte
led
forward
her
brother
a
rather
young
man
and
introduced
him
to
flora
with
a
manner
which
plainly
said
he
a
nice
fellow
flora
was
however
in
no
mood
for
introductions
to
strangers
she
bowed
but
did
not
speak
is
a
lawyer
said
lotte
triumphantly
flora
slightly
bowed
again
without
comprehending
that
the
fact
would
be
of
any
advantage
to
her
and
mr
nutty
snorted
as
if
he
instantly
smelt
hostile
opposition
to
his
supremacy
the
fact
was
charley
was
a
clerk
on
shillings
per
week
but
he
had
improved
the
opportunities
he
possessed
by
working
very
hard
reading
up
the
best
works
on
the
study
and
practice
of
the
law
making
himself
master
of
cases
which
were
precedents
and
in
fact
doing
his
best
to
fit
himself
either
for
the
bar
if
he
could
raise
the
necessary
funds
to
be
called
to
it
or
to
be
a
solicitor
his
principal
object
as
at
present
entertained
by
him
was
to
place
his
sister
above
the
reach
of
want
and
the
necessity
for
her
present
labour
he
little
knew
how
hard
the
work
how
small
the
earnings
out
of
his
narrow
weekly
salary
he
contrived
occasionally
to
make
her
little
presents
and
certainly
he
visited
no
place
or
person
more
regularly
or
more
frequently
than
he
did
the
humble
abode
of
his
sister
not
that
he
went
much
anywhere
for
he
well
knew
that
eminence
in
the
path
he
had
marked
out
to
pursue
could
not
be
achieved
unless
by
an
incessant
and
persevering
study
which
has
destroyed
more
men
than
it
has
ever
made
great
lotte
knew
of
his
devotion
to
his
task
how
he
sat
poring
over
dreadfully
dry
books
lighted
in
his
task
by
the
midnight
oil
and
supported
in
his
trying
work
by
the
noble
hope
that
he
should
be
able
some
day
to
keep
her
like
a
lady
how
dearly
she
loved
him
for
it
no
one
could
know
but
herself
and
in
addition
she
thought
him
the
cleverest
lawyer
in
existence
much
worthier
in
respect
of
merit
to
preside
over
the
bench
of
judges
than
the
lord
chief
justice
himself
therefore
when
she
mentioned
to
flora
that
he
was
a
lawyer
she
fully
expected
to
see
her
leap
with
delight
and
she
felt
disappointed
that
she
did
not
in
order
to
prove
his
incontestable
superiority
she
in
rapid
terms
explained
to
him
what
had
occurred
and
begged
him
to
display
the
legal
knowledge
which
she
was
sure
he
possessed
by
ordering
mr
nutty
to
quit
the
premises
instanter
and
to
consider
himself
fortunate
if
he
did
so
without
receiving
that
shaking
to
which
she
fully
believed
he
was
entitled
charley
smiled
and
shook
his
head
but
such
was
the
influence
of
loveliness
on
him
that
after
one
careful
perusal
of
her
fair
lineaments
he
needed
no
urging
from
his
sister
to
render
assistance
if
he
could
he
did
not
ask
himself
whether
his
exertions
would
be
made
in
a
deserving
cause
he
knew
they
would
be
performed
on
behalf
of
one
possessing
rare
personal
attractions
and
under
his
first
impressions
that
sufficed
he
commenced
action
by
questioning
mr
nutty
who
exhibited
most
restive
indications
under
examination
charley
demanded
to
see
the
warrant
under
which
mr
nutty
held
possession
which
mr
nutty
refused
but
under
the
bewildering
sharp
quick
and
pertinent
questions
of
the
young
lawyer
he
let
slip
the
fact
that
jukes
had
gone
away
without
lodging
it
with
him
are
not
certain
that
jukes
has
it
i
dare
be
sworn
cried
charley
looking
at
him
fixedly
yes
i
am

that
will

oath
on
it
i
seed
it
in
his
hand
when
he
made
the
seizure

his
prisoner

after
him

with
a
look
if
he
goes

but
out
he
must
go

nutty

use
the
proper
force
to
put

and
unless
you
at
once

i
warn

you
must
take
the
consequences
of
the
false
position
in
which
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
your
employer
through
his
negligence
has
placed
cried
nutty
folding
his
arms
and
placing
his
back
against
the
wall
well
said
charley
is
a
point
we
have
to
he
caught
mr
nutty
firmly
by
the
wrist
and
then
giving
his
own
hand
an
overturn
and
an
underturn
he
with
his
left
hand
seized
him
by
his
collar
and
drew
him
at
a
rapid
rate
towards
the
door
mr
nutty
uttered
a
yell
he
cried
my
arm
on
charley
however
heeded
him
not
but
put
him
outside
the
door
on
to
the
landing
the
man
in
possession
was
thus
no
longer
entitled
to
his
cognomen
chapter
the
forgery
thou
do
such
a
deed
for
all
the
world
why
would
not
you
no
by
this
heavenly
light
by
my
troth
i
think
i
should
shakspere
charley
had
barely
the
room
when
jukes
burst
into
it
with
a
sudden
crash
followed
by
sudds
and
nutty
a
noisy
and
angry
colloquy
instantly
ensued
but
charley
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
character
of
the
men
he
had
to
deal
with
either
to
permit
himself
to
be
bullied
or
browbeaten
and
he
had
no
intention
that
they
should
maintain
their
standing
upon
illegal
documents
authorised
by
flora
wilton
and
in
the
name
of
her
father
he
demanded
to
see
the
warrant
of
execution
upon
the
goods
jukes
refused
he
had
come
back
to
take
them
away
and
had
a
van
at
the
door
for
that
purpose
charley
however
would
on
no
account
allow
this
he
defied
jukes
to
remove
the
furniture
until
the
proper
return
had
been
made
to
the
sheriff
or
until
the
claims
of
the
landlord
had
been
satisfied
he
interposed
other
legal
objections
and
raised
points
of
a
technical
description
on
the
face
of
the
warrant
which
jukes
had
at
length
produced
until
even
that
astute
personage
became
mystified
and
consented
to
leave
things
in
until
the
morning
when
having
obtained
advice
from
the
solicitor
by
whom
he
had
been
employed
he
should
be
prepared
to
act
with
more
determined
vigour
than
now
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
jukes
had
been
promised
a
handsome
remuneration
if
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
old
signature
to
a
document
confessed
to
be
of
great
importance
and
he
knew
that
it
was
not
exactly
his
best
course
to
act
in
such
a
manner
as
to
drive
the
man
frenzied
with
rage
by
the
harsh
and
heartless
proceedings
he
was
instructed
to
take
he
was
well
aware
that
a
strong
pressure
must
be
applied
to
bring
the
obstinate
old
to
compliance
with
the
demand
now
made
upon
him
but
he
was
also
shrewd
enough
to
surmise
that
an
overpressure
would
have
the
contrary
effect
to
that
desired
and
instead
of
disposing
old
wilton
to
sign
would
render
him
more
firmly
than
ever
fixed
on
his
refusal
the
warrant
was
therefore
with
due
ceremony
handed
to
mr
nutty
and
he
was
instructed
to
remain
until
either
the
claim
under
which
possession
was
held
had
been
paid
or
he
was
directed
to
quit
he
received
it
with
a
grim
smile
of
satisfaction
and
prepared
to
go
on
with
his
inventory
with
an
inflexible
resolve
that
the
most
treasured
article
of
affection
should
not
after
this
escape
being
recorded
in
his
list
but
even
now
things
were
not
to
remain
as
thus
arranged
the
door
of
the
apartment
which
had
been
closed
was
once
more
unceremoniously
thrown
open
an
old
man
with
a
shrivelled
face
of
a
deep
turmeric
hue
as
if
the
yellow
jaundice
had
been
for
years
his
favourite
complaint
stalked
rather
than
walked
into
the
room
he
was
a
man
with
a
certain
peculiarity
in
his
mien
which
would
prevent
the
possibility
of
his
going
anywhere
in
society
without
his
being
stared
at
he
wore
a
cloth
frock
coat
a
buff
waistcoat
as
yellow
as
his
own
face
and
chocolate
trousers
almost
tight
enough
to
be
pantaloons
upon
his
feet
which
were
small
were
polished
boots
and
upon
his
head
a
bright
black
carefully
brushed
beaver
hat
very
much
turned
up
at
the
brim
he
was
followed
by
a
small
man
dressed
all
in
black
save
his
cravat
his
whiskers
and
his
hair
were
white
with
the
whiteness
of
what
is
dead
and
formed
a
strange
contrast
to
his
garb
the
old
gentleman
on
gaining
the
middle
of
the
room
turned
a
pair
of
jet
black
brilliant
eyes
upon
jukes
and
smiled
not
auspiciously
but
cynically
and
yet
triumphantly
wrong
room
ejaculated
jukes
suggestively
at
all
replied
the
old
man
exhibiting
a
row
of
teeth
which
appeared
ghastly
in
that
golden
visage
name
is
nathan
gomer
this
house
is
mine
i
am
the
landlord
and
my
claim
upon
the
contents
of
these
apartments
takes
precedence
of
yours
i
think
it
does
i
say
i
believe
it
you
the
landlord
said
jukes
eyeing
him
doubtfully
can
prove
that
jukes

jukes

broker
added
nathan
gomer
less
than
one
hundred
pounds

owing
to
me
for
how
long

months
replied
nathan
gomer
wilton
rented
the
whole
house
and
has
not
paid
me
the
last
rent
there
is
not
more
than
enough
here
to
satisfy
my
claim
i
think
so
i

i

there
is
gruffly
muttered
jukes
your

of

said
nathan
gomer

it
formal
and
like
to
look
at
it
said
jukes
to
charley
should
he
answered
it
to
nathan
gomer
looked
at
him
with
inquiring
eyes
and
watched
him
read
every
word
in
the
document
with
careful
attention
from
the
first
to
the
last
when
he
had
ended
his
perusal
nathan
gomer
smiled
informal
or
contrary
to
law
there
he
exclaimed
said
charley
with
a
sigh
is
dreadful
murmured
lotte
flora
however
was
not
further
distressed
at
least
she
displayed
no
additional
grief
at
this
new
incident
she
had
in
fact
been
so
stunned
and
overwhelmed
by
the
first
event
of
the
morning
that
which
involved
the
compulsory
absence
of
her
father
that
any
circumstance
of
a
minor
description
could
neither
add
to
nor
diminish
her
sorrow
nathan
gomer
turned
to
jukes
can
go
he
said
you
may
take
your
myrmidons
with
return
the
writ
to
the
sheriff
with
nully
bony
on
it
i
exclaimed
jukes
chagrined
you

nathan

if
it
suits
thank
ye
your
name
will
be
handed
in
to

and
drain
solicitors
old
jewry
replied
jukes
with
a
most
significant
nod
of
the
head
which
implied
a
threat
will
do
as
well
said
nathan
know
me
they
stand
indebted
to
me
in
a
good
round
the
nether
jaw
of
jukes
slightly
dropped
he
gave
a
steadfast
look
at
nathan
gomer
his
eyes
then
slowly
ran
round
the
room
and
settled
on
flora
who
pale
as
marble
stood
as
though
she
were
in
a
trance
all
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
around
her
he
gazed
at
her
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
a
sudden
flash
illumined
his
eyes
indicating
that
a
new
idea
had
taken
possession
of
him
and
then
he
turned
to
his
followers
and
said
then
sudds
come
along
nutty
good
day
gomer
your
turn
this
day
good
day
jukes
as
you
say
i
think
it
is
my
turn
this
time
i
believe
i
may
say
it
is
my
turn
this
time
answered
nathan
rubbing
his
hands
jukes
hastened
out
of
the
room
closely
attended
by
his
satellites
nutty
looking
especially
as
his
possession
money
would
in
all
probability
be
returned
as
well
as
the
writ
when
these
men
had
fairly
slammed
the
after
them
and
the
sound
had
risen
up
through
the
house
nathan
gomer
who
had
listened
attentively
for
it
surveyed
the
persons
of
both
charley
and
lotte
and
then
addressing
flora
said
wilton
are
these
young
persons
friends
of
yours
flora
upon
hearing
her
name
started
and
slightly
shuddered
as
one
rousing
from
a
painful
reverie
lotte
gave
her
no
time
to
answer
for
she
said
hastily
yes
sir
new
friends
it
is
true
but
not
the
less
disposed
warmly
to
serve
her
in
her
present
terrible
affliction
so
far
as
our
humble
means
will
pray
what
are
your
means
demanded
nathan
lotte
for
a
moment
hung
her
head
and
a
bright
flush
mounted
to
her
cheek
and
forehead
then
she
flung
up
her
face
and
with
her
clear
bright
eyes
looked
steadfastly
at
the
little
old
man
with
the
golden
visage
in
a
few
rapid
words
she
sketched
the
position
of
herself
and
her
brother
and
the
bright
youthful
sanguine
hopes
they
both
entertained
of
their
future
lotte
well
said
my
pet
cried
charley
patting
her
affectionately
and
approvingly
upon
the
shoulder
as
for
what
i
can
do
why
somehow
see
you
through
it
a
book
or
two
less
and
a
dinner
he
was
about
to
say
but
he
checked
himself
and
substituted
pleasure
the
fewer
i
miss
and
i
would
not
forego
the
happiness
of
witnessing
your
gratification
at
being
able
to
serve
a
friend
in
distress
for
something
far
beyond
such
sacrifices
as
cried
nathan
gomer
to
lotte
a
day
for
eighteen
hours
at
shillings
sometimes
she
interposed
boastfully
shillings
always
if
you
will
continued
nathan
you
no
margin
for
doing
anything
but
starving
and
slaving
if
you
pay
your
way
and
you
my
he
added
turning
to
charley
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
achieve
to
the
bar
have
not
a
farthing
to
waste
upon
even
the
luxury
of
seeing
your
sister
destroy
herself
in
an
attempt
to
accomplish
a
feat
which
is
not
only
impracticable
but
impossible
no
no
go
on
as
you
have
been
going
on
and
let
us
see
what
time
will
bring
he
paused
and
then
after
running
his
eye
over
the
warrant
he
addressed
flora
saying
wilton
i
place
this
warrant
in
your
keeping
impressing
upon
you
that
you
must
always
have
it
in
your
possession
in
safe
custody
except
when
you
leave
home
for
a
short
time
then
you
must
entrust
it
to
some
friend
who
will
hold
it
here
until
your
return
so
long
as
you
do
this
no
person
like
jukes
can
disturb
or
remove
your
furniture
you
will
keep
it
until
you
see
me
again
or
until
you
hear
from
me
i
am
a
stranger
to
you
not
prepossessing
in
my
appearance
but
i
am
not
quite
so
as
i
have
been
represented
to
be
nor
quite
so
selfish
in
my
nature
as
you
may
hereafter
be
led
to
believe
now
mark
what
i
say
you
have
been
left
in
a
position
of
great
trust
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
calamity
much
will
be
demanded
of
your
energy
and
self
reliance
remember
helps
those
who
help
therefore
while
you
are
grateful
for
place
no
reliance
in
promises
farewell
we
shall
meet
again
may
it
be
when
you
will
not
need
my
assistance
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
closely
followed
by
graba
leaving
flora
no
less
than
lotte
in
a
state
of
bewildered
astonishment
neither
of
the
girls
had
seen
nathan
gomer
before
and
his
sudden
appearance
together
with
the
power
he
had
assumed
and
the
kindness
which
in
a
cold
abrupt
manner
he
had
displayed
completely
astounded
them
they
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
nor
so
far
as
lotte
was
concerned
how
to
talk
enough
about
it
but
though
she
talked
briskly
she
acted
smartly
and
rousing
flora
into
action
proceeded
to
things
straight
and
to
render
the
aspect
of
the
place
pretty
much
what
it
had
been
before
jukes
made
his
most
unwelcome
appearance
leaving
her
and
flora
to
the
task
to
which
they
had
devoted
themselves
let
us
follow
the
movements
of
nathan
gomer
he
stood
alone
at
the
door
of
grahame
in
the
park
very
shortly
after
he
had
quitted
residence
and
he
sent
in
his
card
in
a
rather
peremptory
manner
by
the
same
individual
who
had
announced
chewkle
he
took
no
heed
of
the
representations
made
to
him
that
grahame
were
engaged
and
when
he
were
engaged
his
instructions
was
that
no
person
should
be
admitted
to
interrupt
him
my
card
see
said
nathan
emphatically
you
refuse
he
added
as
the
man
hesitated
will
walk
up
into
the
library
where
you
say
he
is
engaged
with
some
one
and
obtain
your
dismissal
by
acquainting
your
master
with
your
refusal
to
announce
there
was
something
in
the
manner
of
nathan
that
whelks
the
head
footman
did
not
approve
of
especially
as
he
felt
himself
overawed
by
it
in
spite
of
the
affront
to
which
he
was
called
upon
to
submit
it
was
evident
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
little
visitor
his
importance
was
sadly
underrated
and
that
he
should
have
to
put
in
his
pocket
the
threat
of
dismissal
which
had
been
held
out
to
him
and
which
though
he
turned
his
nose
up
at
it
caused
him
to
take
the
card
and
proceed
into
the
library
as
the
word
issued
from
his
lips
he
took
no
heed
of
it
for
his
mind
was
filled
with
nathan
gomer
not
favourably
he
exclaimed
in
the
affected
strain
he
usually
adopted
when
addressing
his
master
is
a
pesson
dare
you
scoundrel
intrude
when
i
am
especially
and
privately
engaged
with
any
gentleman
cried
grahame
leaping
to
his
feet
and
speaking
passionately
while
his
eyes
sparkled
with
fury
whelks
started
back
and
his
wig
sent
up
a
small
cloud
of
flour
he
was
so
startled
by
the
sudden
action
of
grahame
that
he
could
hear
his
own
heart
beat
against
his
ribs
ask
pardon
sir
he
faltered
out
the
pesson
the
person
below
cried
grahame
forgetting
in
his
rage
that
dignified
pride
which
never
permitted
an
ebullition
of
anger
whelks
heartily
echoed
the
sentiment
but
dared
not
so
express
himself
he
only
bowed
affirmatively
i
not
repeatedly
told
you
sir
continued
grahame
sternly
i
will
only
be
seen
by
those
of
whom
i
have
some
knowledge
or
whom
i
desire
to
see
another
infringement
of
my
order
and
you
shall
be
summarily
it
struck
whelks
that
his
master
spoke
in
much
the
same
strain
when
he
saw
chewkle
he
therefore
handed
to
him
card
grahame
snatched
the
card
from
the
salver
on
which
whelks
presented
it
and
on
reading
it
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
to
hide
any
emotion
which
might
betray
itself
he
sank
down
into
his
chair
and
laid
himself
back
plunged
in
intense
thought
then
he
looked
at
the
card
and
appeared
to
read
it
a
dozen
times
at
length
he
turned
to
whelks
and
said
say
i
shall
be
happy
to
have
the
honour
of
receiving
this
whelks
with
an
expression
of
surprise
on
a
countenance
incapable
of
displaying
any
very
distinct
phase
of
emotion
descended
to
the
hall
to
obey
his
commands
chewkle
said
grahame
when
whelks
had
disappeared
i
ask
you
to
favour
me
by
stepping
into
this
chamber
for
a
few
minutes
my
visitor
a
very
wealthy
and
distinguished
person
i
assure
you
will
not
detain
me
long
and
then
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
renewing
our
important
chewkle
expressed
his
happiness
at
having
the
opportunity
of
obliging
grahame
in
any
fashion
and
promptly
dived
into
a
small
room
overlooking
the
park
and
connected
with
the
library
he
heard
grahame
lock
the
door
securing
him
in
his
little
retreat
but
he
carefully
placed
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
in
anticipation
of
picking
up
something
worth
hearing
and
retaining
if
he
was
paid
handsomely
for
secrecy
grahame
had
scarcely
resumed
his
seat
when
nathan
gomer
entered
the
library
he
returned
the
bow
graciously
performed
with
which
he
was
greeted
and
placing
his
hat
and
gloves
upon
a
chair
seated
himself
upon
another
and
commenced
speaking
in
rather
a
louder
key
than
grahame
thought
quite
desirable
grahame
he
began
have
not
met
before
but
you
are
not
unacquainted
with
my
dear
no
of
course
it
is
most
familiar
to
me
observed
grahame
my
money
continued
nathan
gomer
not
returned
grahame
a
little
confused
have
made
me
fresh
proposals
a
short
term
i
hope
you
understand
that
so
but
i
want
to
know
upon
what
foundation
you
base
your
expectation
of
returning
the
sums
demanded
whole
sole
entire
possession
of
an
enormous
property
vast
estates
yielding
a
splendid
income
and
a
very
considerable
amount
in
cash
the
accumulation
of
is
in
chancery
link
is
wanting
i
think
to
perfect
your
claim
my
dear
sir
a
mere
nothing
such
as
it
is
we
are
prepared
to
supply
you
are
eh
are
quite
clear
about
that
was
ever
more
that
is
satisfactory
to
be
sure
but
stay
is
there
not
another
person
who
has
something
to
do
with
it
one
one
dear
me
what
is
his
name
one
pshaw
how
absurd
in
me
to
forget
know
of
no
person
save
myself
gomer
who
has
the
shadow
of
a
claim
to
any
portion
of
a
soul
i
have
been
misinformed
i
was
given
to
understand
that
a
person
named
named
i
do
not
often
forget
names
can
not
you
help
me
grahame
to
the
name
of
the
individual
who
claims
the
property
of
which
you
have
spoken
as
well
as
you
i
this
was
said
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
and
the
manner
of
a
man
who
having
made
a
positive
assertion
sees
that
it
is
doubted
and
wishes
it
to
be
thought
that
the
incredulity
is
unjust
the
glittering
eye
of
nathan
gomer
seemed
to
play
over
every
feature
of
countenance
suddenly
he
said
with
startling
abruptness
i
remember
it
i
have
it
wilton
is
the
name
wilton
who
follows
the
occupation
of
a
chaser
has
he
not
a
claim
also
wanting
a
link
to
this
property
it
might
have
been
fancy
but
the
sound
of
a
whistle
appeared
to
issue
from
the
vicinity
of
a
in
the
door
of
the
overlooking
the
park
wilton
exclaimed
grahame
assuming
an
air
of
reflection
to
hide
his
embarrassment
no
oh
no
i
know
nothing
of
any
such
do
not
the
man
himself
living
in
clerkenwell
not
where
is
clerkenwell
ugh
ugh
nathan
gomer
was
seized
with
a
cough
he
rose
up
took
his
hat
and
gloves
and
put
them
on
with
slow
precision
his
glittering
eye
once
more
perused
every
feature
in
face
grahame
he
said
slowly
shall
hear
from
you
thank
you
my
dear
sir
replied
grahame
rubbing
his
hands
me
hope
in
a
manner
agreeable
to
my
wishes
and
in
accordance
with
your
known
will
be
one
of
two
things
grahame
either
to
comply
with
your
proposition
or
to
issue
process
for
the
recovery
of
the
money
now
due
by
you
to
me
good
morning
grahame
he
seemed
to
glide
out
of
the
room
down
the
staircase
and
presented
himself
at
the
elbow
of
whelks
before
that
personage
had
any
conception
that
his
services
were
required
to
show
out
the
yellow
which
he
was
just
informing
the
had
a
few
minutes
before
shown
in
to
the
in
a
sharp
shrill
tone
nathan
requested
to
be
let
out
and
taking
upon
himself
the
duty
of
the
inert
porter
threw
open
the
wide
and
closed
it
with
a
loud
bang
thankful
he
knew
not
wherefore
that
the
was
out
of
the
house
grahame
looked
after
nathan
as
he
moved
rapidly
but
noiselessly
down
the
stairs
and
returned
into
the
library
feeling
that
the
interview
had
been
of
a
very
unsatisfactory
character
he
experienced
an
uneasy
impression
with
respect
to
the
inquiries
made
by
nathan
gomer
respecting
wilton
he
cursed
the
name
of
the
old
but
for
him
he
might
be
in
secure
possession
of
the
wealth
he
coveted
and
which
there
was
no
disguising
it
he
imperatively
needed
the
obstinacy
while
it
did
not
benefit
himself
was
very
likely
to
send
him
grahame
headlong
to
ruin
for
want
of
what
only
a
signature
a
simple
signature
ah
suggestion
flashed
through
his
brain
it
was
but
to
attach
a
name
to
a
bond
who
would
know
that
he
had
done
it
but
chewkle
and
would
not
money
buy
any
tongue
with
aid
it
might
be
done
who
else
could
know
it
wilton
starving
dying
in
prison
shattered
by
grief
want
and
toil
his
children
outcasts
in
the
streets
driven
perhaps
into
dens
of
infamy
how
could
they
prosecute
a
claim
against
him
if
they
did
should
he
not
have
the
wealth
to
defeat
every
such
attempt
could
he
not
buy
off
or
suborn
all
witnesses
against
him
the
possessions
and
the
money
he
should
acquire
by
that
single
signature
would
enable
him
to
cope
with
the
most
greedy
demands
for
bearing
false
witness
shallow
reasoning
enough
but
conclusive
in
his
eyes
his
train
of
thought
having
conducted
him
to
this
point
the
fact
that
he
had
chewkle
locked
up
in
the
small
overlooking
the
park
presented
itself
had
the
man
overheard
what
had
transpired
between
him
and
nathan
gomer
a
flush
of
heat
crossed
his
brow
at
the
supposition
for
the
moment
he
forgot
all
the
dictates
of
his
pride
lost
utterly
his
austere
bearing
and
crept
on
to
the
door
of
the
little
chamber
he
softly
removed
the
key
and
peered
through
the
keyhole
but
without
catching
sight
of
chewkle
he
replaced
the
key
without
a
sound
and
turning
the
lock
noiselessly
he
flung
the
door
open
suddenly
chewkle
with
his
arms
folded
was
standing
in
a
contemplative
attitude
gazing
out
of
the
window
and
watching
the
sportive
movements
of
some
wild
fowl
upon
the
lake
a
chewkle
i
am
at
liberty
now
exclaimed
grahame
recovering
his
pompous
manner
and
feeling
convinced
that
his
conference
with
nathan
gomer
had
not
been
overheard
by
the
commission
agent
chewkle
professed
himself
to
be
quite
ready
to
proceed
to
business
and
begged
grahame
when
he
made
apologies
for
detaining
him
while
he
transacted
important
matters
not
to
mention
it
indeed
there
was
no
necessity
as
quick
ear
applied
in
the
right
place
had
heard
every
word
that
passed
so
the
poor
old
fool
wilton
continues
obstinate
does
he
exclaimed
grahame
to
chewkle
when
they
were
both
as
hadamant
returned
chewkle
is
only
doing
himself
harm
suggested
grahame
nobody
else
no
good
added
chewkle
certainly
is
not
acting
in
a
manner
to
entitle
him
to
consideration
observed
grahame
reflectively
a
bit
of
it
responded
chewkle
is
to
be
got
out
of
sort
you
may
as
well
try
to
get
butter
out
flint
so
if
i
was
you
sir
i
should
just
say
nothen
to
anybody
but
me
and
go
do
it
at
once
a
good
time
never
grahame
grew
cold
and
white
and
his
teeth
chattered
it
was
a
tremendous
act
the
punishment
penal
servitude
for
life
how
the
words
rang
in
his
ears
a
moment
more
and
the
threat
of
nathan
gomer
boomed
through
his
brain
like
the
minute
guns
of
a
ship
of
war
announcing
an
approaching
execution
process
for
the
recovery
of
the
money
now
he
shivered
as
though
he
had
come
out
of
a
cold
spring
bath
he
placed
his
trembling
fingers
upon
the
handle
of
a
drawer
and
opened
it
he
turned
over
some
papers
and
drew
forth
a
letter
it
bore
the
signature
wilton
in
a
bold
hand
is
his
handwriting
he
said
to
chewkle
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
with
a
sickly
smile
my
wig
said
chewkle
as
he
gazed
on
it
with
admiring
eyes
prime
clear
sort
of
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
parchment
is
that
inquired
grahame
with
chattering
teeth
deed
that
wilton
sign
responded
chewkle
you
got
a
piece
of
thin
paper
he
asked
grahame
with
a
beating
heart
and
trembling
hand
gave
him
half
a
sheet
of
thin
post
will
just
do
he
said
he
then
put
his
hand
into
his
side
pocket
and
produced
a
small
phial
containing
a
thin
fluid
with
a
pink
tinge
he
produced
a
pencil
and
steeping
it
in
the
liquid
painted
over
the
back
of
that
portion
of
the
note
which
contained
the
signature
of
wilton
grahame
with
eyes
starting
out
of
their
sockets
watched
him
without
breathing
after
waiting
for
a
minute
he
examined
carefully
and
then
laying
it
upon
the
thin
paper
which
he
had
previously
damped
he
slightly
burnished
the
back
and
there
appeared
upon
the
thin
paper
the
signature
of
wilton
reversed
this
he
in
turn
laid
upon
the
deed
on
the
place
for
the
name
of
the
person
signing
the
deed
to
appear
and
again
using
the
burnisher
with
more
firmness
he
reproduced
though
somewhat
faintly
the
name
of
wilton
upon
the
deed
said
he
to
grahame
it
is
you
have
only
to
mark
over
it
carefully
and
the
name
will
be
there
with
such
exactness
the
man
himself
swear
it
do
it
my
good
friend
chewkle

the
pen
and

over
it
gasped
grahame
convulsively

firmly

beautiful
dot
that
l

now
for
that
little
bit
flourish
it
done
capitally
done
the
grahame
uttered
a
groan
and
sank
back
in
his
chair
chewkle
caught
him
with
a
sudden
grip
by
the
wrist
is
a
dreadful
secret
i
have
of
yourn
he
growled
me
to
you
that
have
to
be
generous
to
me
to
make
me
keep
it
witness
of
my
infamy
your
most
avaricious
wishes
shall
be
gratified
hissed
grahame
through
his
teeth
have
only
to
be
the
grave
said
chewkle
placing
his
finger
to
his
lip
suddenly
grahame
uttered
a
shout
of
horror
his
eye
fell
upon
nathan
gomer
who
a
few
paces
from
him
was
standing
watching
him
attentively
god
gomer
how
what
why
are
you
here
he
exclaimed
gasping
for
breath
chewkle
in
an
instant
spread
a
newspaper
which
was
on
the
table
over
the
deed
not
alarm
yourself
grahame
replied
nathan
gomer
with
the
coolest
merely
returned
to
say
after
a
brief
reflection
that
i
have
decided
on
entertaining
your
proposals
you
had
better
therefore
put
your
solicitor
in
connection
with
mine
good
morning
eye
glittered
on
chewkle
for
an
instant
so
as
to
make
that
person
feel
most
uncomfortable
then
he
moved
swiftly
and
noiselessly
out
of
the
room
grahame
pale
as
death
sank
back
in
his
chair
chewkle
gazed
in
the
direction
which
nathan
gomer
had
taken
and
ejaculated
blowed
chapter
the
conflagration
the
wild
confusion
and
the
swarthy
glow
of
flames
on
high
and
torches
from
below
the
shriek
of
terror
and
the
mingling
yell
he
climbs
the
crackling
stair
he
bursts
the
door
nor
feels
his
feet
glow
scorching
with
the
floor
his
breath
choked
gasping
with
the
volumed
smoke
but
still
from
room
to
room
his
way
he
broke
byron
the
events
of
the
morning
in
which
he
had
taken
so
prominent
a
part
presented
to
hal
vivian
when
alone
in
his
chamber
that
evening
rather
a
wide
field
for
contemplation
he
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
which
the
close
of
the
labour
gave
him
to
retire
to
the
solitude
of
his
neatly
furnished
bedroom
because
unobserved
he
could
there
review
the
circumstances
which
had
that
day
occurred
and
give
to
them
the
colouring
most
agreeable
to
the
feelings
which
had
recently
taken
possession
of
him
he
threw
himself
into
an
easy
chair
and
was
quickly
engaged
in
drawing
deductions
not
for
a
second
was
the
fair
face
of
flora
absent
from
his
vision
the
rugged
visage
of
jukes
the
grimy
features
of
his
satellites
the
impassible
countenance
of
nathan
gomer
which
seemed
moulded
out
of
fine
gold
the
bright
frank
aspect
of
lotte
by
turns
floated
across
his
mental
speculum
but
never
to
displace
that
of
flora
out
of
the
past
a
future
was
to
be
formed
he
tried
to
construct
it
and
in
doing
so
set
himself
honestly
to
work
to
examine
those
feelings
which
prompted
him
so
strongly
to
undertake
the
task
he
sought
to
understand
why
he
should
interest
himself
at
all
in
the
affairs
of
the
old
what
motives
should
have
induced
him
to
interfere
and
take
part
in
what
had
happened
that
morning
or
why
he
should
be
so
very
eager
to
effect
certain
happy
results
he
had
in
contemplation
and
the
answer
which
constantly
presented
itself
to
these
and
other
questions
was
flora
wilton
hal
vivian
was
just
out
of
his
time
but
a
few
days
and
his
seven
long
years
were
out
he
was
at
that
age
in
man
when
love
partakes
very
strongly
of
the
imaginative
and
clothes
the
object
of
affection
with
an
excellence
and
perfection
which
though
it
be
not
always
just
makes
her
whom
he
loves
to
him
a
almost
every
youth
creates
in
his
mind
a
standard
of
perfect
loveliness
and
if
he
perchance
meets
with
a
face
which
presents
some
resemblance
to
the
mental
image
he
has
formed
he
at
once
proceeds
to
invest
it
with
all
the
charms
with
which
he
has
endowed
the
unreal
the
maid
is
elected
to
the
first
place
in
his
heart
she
becomes
his
guiding
influence
he
busies
himself
by
contemplating
schemes
of
impossible
delights
for
her
is
anxious
to
be
at
her
side
whenever
apart
and
most
loth
when
with
her
to
tear
himself
from
her
no
doubt
a
very
considerable
amount
of
mental
deception
is
practised
during
this
phase
of
youthful
existence
and
when
marriage
has
bestowed
upon
the
lovesick
swain
the
object
he
has
so
ardently
coveted
he
perhaps
finds
that
he
has
been
gazing
through
what
he
now
considers
the
wrong
end
of
the
telescope
harry
vivian
was
however
like
all
youths
of
his
age
in
no
condition
to
believe
that
the
being
he
had
made
his
representative
angel
could
ever
prove
the
reverse
he
had
always
seen
her
mild
and
gentle
soft
in
manner
courteous
in
speech
amiable
in
expression
and
exquisitely
lovely
in
person
he
could
suppose
no
other
side
to
the
picture
and
so
as
she
outwardly
resembled
an
angel
he
gave
her
credit
for
being
inwardly
a
saint
his
intimacy
with
her
was
slight
his
opportunities
of
seeing
her
save
during
the
past
year
when
he
had
made
them
had
not
been
many
he
had
interchanged
but
few
words
with
her
and
they
were
of
a
very
commonplace
description
he
had
not
hitherto
thought
of
her
more
than
that
she
was
a
girl
of
rare
and
delicate
beauty
whose
features
he
should
like
to
reproduce
in
some
of
the
choice
modellings
of
the
precious
metals
entrusted
to
him
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
no
artist
however
marvellous
his
skill
in
delineating
the
female
face
divine
had
ever
succeeded
in
producing
one
so
beautiful
as
love
had
however
taken
no
part
in
this
admiration
he
had
gazed
upon
her
and
thought
of
her
as
he
would
have
done
of
the
best
efforts
of
the
greatest
masters
of
art
thing
of
beauty
but
animated
with
life
her
sudden
appearance
at
the
window
the
golden
sunbeams
falling
on
her
face
her
hair
her
light
dress
bringing
her
beauty
out
in
strong
relief
from
the
dark
chamber
in
which
she
stood
altered
at
one
stroke
the
condition
of
his
feelings
passion
sprang
into
life
simultaneously
with
the
glance
he
turned
upon
her
it
intermingled
with
his
admiration
and
became
love
he
was
not
conscious
of
the
change
wrought
within
him
when
he
instinctively
surmised
that
trouble
and
trial
hovered
over
her
and
that
he
should
take
an
active
part
in
endeavouring
to
avert
it
he
had
not
a
notion
of
it
even
when
seated
with
harper
his
uncle
discoursing
on
the
position
of
the
wilton
family
he
employed
himself
devising
how
the
all
but
orphaned
child
of
their
skilled
workman
might
be
rescued
from
destitution
here
in
his
chamber
alone
in
deep
meditation
and
it
flashed
through
his
mind
a
sudden
glow
of
heat
pervaded
his
frame
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
impulsively
a
strange
tremor
thrilled
through
him
a
feeling
of
apprehension
crept
over
him
and
a
species
of
sadness
oppressed
him
wherefore
he
could
not
comprehend
here
was
food
for
contemplation
indeed
and
he
resumed
his
seat
to
pursue
this
new
subject
through
its
many
ramifications
until
he
should
arrive
at
some
kind
of
ultimate
result
one
fact
followed
from
this
discovery
made
by
him
up
to
this
moment
he
had
been
in
his
knowledge
of
the
world
a
mere
boy
he
was
at
a
moment
transformed
into
a
man
he
had
to
love
and
the
affection
was
not
of
the
same
nature
as
that
entertained
for
kith
or
kin
he
had
taken
up
a
responsibility
and
at
once
there
was
something
to
live
for
work
for
seek
for
and
to
win
fame
wealth
honour
were
now
worth
striving
to
gain
because
there
was
one
whose
approbation
he
coveted
to
share
the
wealth
and
honour
to
be
secured
by
persevering
energy
and
untiring
ardour
in
commencing
his
struggle
with
the
world
here
was
an
incentive
to
ambition
beyond
a
mere
love
of
art
or
the
desire
to
excel
and
a
motive
for
reaping
golden
opinions
beyond
the
common
wish
to
become
rich
it
is
true
there
was
nothing
in
manner
to
lead
him
to
believe
that
he
had
created
any
such
impression
upon
her
as
she
had
upon
him
and
the
probabilities
were
that
she
did
not
see
him
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
gentlemanly
and
young
man
who
had
been
kind
and
considerate
to
her
father
in
business
and
singularly
generous
and
friendly
to
her
in
her
moment
of
trial
all
this
he
quite
understood
and
though
he
felt
himself
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
he
did
not
deceive
himself
into
any
other
notion
than
that
to
win
her
love
his
work
was
yet
to
commence
to
be
prosecuted
with
faithful
perseverance
and
in
an
honorable
and
unselfish
spirit
as
true
love
looks
to
marriage
as
its
goal
so
did
that
possessed
by
hal
but
romantic
generous
and
as
he
was
by
nature
he
had
yet
so
much
of
the
common
leaven
in
him
that
it
struck
him
it
would
be
worth
consideration
to
ascertain
into
what
kind
of
family
he
should
introduce
himself
by
an
alliance
with
miss
wilton
his
own
position
was
very
soon
determined
he
was
the
son
of
a
deceased
sister
of
harper
the
goldsmith
was
apprenticed
to
him
and
would
in
all
probability
be
his
heir
as
his
only
son
had
turned
out
wild
in
his
youth
and
had
after
the
commission
of
some
outrageous
piece
of
profligacy
disappeared
it
was
supposed
he
had
fled
to
india
but
from
his
departure
to
the
present
hour
he
had
not
been
heard
of
harper
had
mentioned
to
hal
an
intention
that
he
had
formed
of
taking
him
into
partnership
with
him
but
he
had
decided
first
on
subjecting
him
to
a
probation
of
a
year
or
two
to
try
whether
the
promise
of
steadiness
and
sobriety
which
his
youth
had
given
would
be
realised
future
might
consequently
be
said
to
be
formed
for
him
and
it
was
into
his
family
he
should
introduce
miss
wilton
as
his
wife
if
ever
the
union
took
place
therefore
while
considering
his
own
happiness
he
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
not
to
overlook
that
of
his
uncle
who
had
behaved
to
him
from
his
infancy
as
a
tender
just
and
generous
father
it
would
be
a
task
he
should
impose
upon
himself
to
ascertain
as
far
as
possible
the
previous
history
of
old
wilton
not
that
he
feared
the
result
would
turn
out
other
than
he
could
wish
but
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
there
was
a
mystery
hanging
over
the
old
worker
in
gold
which
it
would
be
proper
if
possible
to
penetrate
some
years
back
wilton
had
suddenly
presented
himself
at
the
shop
of
harper
for
employment
in
carving
in
gold
inquiries
elicited
that
he
had
not
been
bred
to
the
business
he
professed
but
was
what
might
be
termed
a
scientific
amateur
harper
was
struck
by
his
language
and
by
his
remarks
upon
the
processes
and
art
of
modelling
and
chasing
and
being
much
pressed
at
the
time
with
an
excess
of
business
he
entrusted
him
with
some
valuable
work
the
more
readily
when
he
found
that
old
wilton
resided
exactly
opposite
to
him
wilton
returned
with
his
task
accomplished
in
a
manner
greatly
to
satisfaction
and
from
that
time
he
had
been
employed
by
him
he
always
executed
his
work
excellently
but
he
was
not
always
punctual
and
twice
or
thrice
harper
in
anger
had
threatened
to
discontinue
employing
him
but
wilton
generally
contrived
to
smooth
away
his
irritation
and
they
went
on
as
before
nothing
was
known
of
him
whence
or
when
or
how
he
came
he
seldom
went
out
and
only
worked
for
harper
so
much
hal
knew
no
one
knew
more
and
yet
they
do
know
a
good
deal
about
each
other
in
clerkenwell
hal
resolved
now
that
his
knowledge
should
not
sleep
here
although
at
the
present
moment
he
could
not
see
quite
clearly
his
way
to
learn
more
his
future
cogitations
were
terminated
by
a
call
to
supper
and
that
meal
being
discussed
he
retired
to
rest
to
think
again
as
before
and
to
fall
into
a
deep
heavy
slumber
he
dreamed
he
thought
he
met
with
flora
in
some
leafy
coppice
and
in
secret
and
that
while
conversing
with
her
in
a
strain
of
loving
tenderness
they
were
interrupted
by
the
tramp
of
a
body
of
persons
approaching
he
fancied
that
he
seized
flora
in
his
arms
and
fled
with
her
but
was
pursued
and
that
his
pursuers
shouted
and
uttered
fierce
threats
he
looked
back
and
saw
that
old
wilton
headed
jukes
and
his
followers
as
well
as
nathan
gomer
and
his
uncle
who
seemed
to
be
the
most
excited
of
the
party
and
called
him
by
name
loudly
then
as
he
still
fled
he
observed
that
his
pursuers
were
armed
and
he
heard
his
uncle
call
to
them
to
fire
upon
him
he
fled
on
still
his
voice
shouted
in
his
ear
fire
fire
at
last
he
sprang
up
in
his
bed
suddenly
awakened
and
still
the
voice
vehemently
cried
fire
fire
a
heavy
hand
beat
violently
against
the
panels
of
his
and
completely
aroused
him
he
at
once
leaped
to
the
floor
and
unlocked
his
door
he
found
his
uncle
without
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
he
was
lord
he
cried
thought
you
would
never
wake
there
is
a
fire
throw
on
your
clothes
hal
my
boy
fire
where
asked
hal
hastily
the
way
returned
harper
quick
while
i
pacify
your
aunt
who
is
frightened
to
he
lit
candle
as
he
spoke
and
shuffled
hastily
away
in
his
slippers
over
the
way
why
house
was
over
the
way
hal
felt
his
blood
rush
violently
through
his
veins
over
the
way
what
if
it
should
be
there
he
drew
on
his
clothes
with
hasty
swiftness
and
he
heard
the
low
hoarse
sounds
of
a
gathering
mob
in
the
streets
the
tramp
of
running
feet
the
violent
knocking
at
doors
and
the
shouts
of
boys
and
men
crying
all
that
was
absolutely
essential
to
wear
but
nothing
that
would
impede
his
activity
or
application
of
strength
did
hal
put
on
and
then
he
hurried
to
one
of
the
front
windows
of
the
house
and
looked
out
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
sudden
and
violent
shock
that
ran
through
his
frame
though
he
had
thought
it
possible
he
had
not
believed
it
probable
that
it
could
be
abode
which
was
on
fire
yet
his
first
glance
told
him
that
the
lower
part
of
that
house
was
in
flames
a
mob
had
gathered
round
an
active
policeman
was
pushing
it
about
to
clear
the
way
for
the
inhabitants
to
bring
out
their
furniture
from
the
burning
house
that
is
if
they
had
a
chance
to
do
aught
beyond
saving
their
lives
the
door
of
the
house
was
open
and
volumes
of
smoke
were
pouring
forth
a
dull
red
flame
throwing
a
ruby
glare
was
to
be
seen
gleaming
through
the
windows
of
the
kitchen
and
the
parlour
the
upper
part
of
the
house
seemed
lost
in
wreathing
dull
gray
cloudy
masses
of
vapour
which
rolled
up
from
the
seat
of
the
fire
rising
up
above
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
assembled
mob
came
the
shouts
of
those
who
were
on
their
way
with
the
first
engine
it
seemed
to
be
the
herald
of
succour
but
alas
it
was
only
the
brought
up
by
an
energetic
beadle
four
men
and
about
twenty
dirty
ragged
boys
the
turncock
arrived
with
it
and
he
though
able
in
the
daylight
to
find
the
blindfold
could
not
without
great
difficulty
discover
it
with
his
eyes
briskly
exercised
at
night
at
lengthy
when
the
parish
engine
bravely
foremost
in
the
rank
was
ready
a
mass
of
volunteers
sprang
forward
to
pump
it
turncock
succeeded
in
pulling
up
the
plug
and
saturating
a
dozen
venturesome
persons
who
with
engineering
spirits
watched
the
operation
the
hose
of
the
was
at
once
connected
with
the
stream
of
water
and
with
a
hurrah
the
volunteers
began
to
work
the
handles
of
the
pump
but
though
they
were
made
to
sound
briskly
nothing
came
of
it
the
as
it
has
ever
been
from
the
hour
it
was
first
invented
to
the
present
time
was
found
to
be
practicably
useless
no
water
could
be
forced
into
the
directing
pipe
to
play
upon
the
burning
house
the
flames
grew
fiercer
the
smoke
denser
and
crackling
sounds
of
wood
splitting
and
the
sputtering
of
sparks
were
more
distinctly
heard
then
there
was
suddenly
a
mighty
cry
from
the
mob
at
the
upper
windows
appeared
shrieking
for
aid
the
forms
of
two
young
girls
they
were
in
their
night
dresses
and
had
evidently
only
just
been
aroused
three
or
four
brave
young
fellows
rushed
into
the
passage
of
the
house
to
ascend
the
stairs
to
save
them
but
a
sheet
of
flame
suddenly
leaped
forth
and
drove
them
back
scorched
thus
victorious
it
seized
the
staircase
in
its
blistering
embrace
and
hissed
and
sputtered
as
it
danced
and
darted
upwards
cutting
off
with
a
species
of
savage
joy
all
means
of
egress
by
that
route
shouts
were
raised
for
the
as
the
attempting
rescuers
were
forced
back
by
the
blinding
burst
of
flame
into
the
streets
and
preparations
were
made
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
to
receive
with
as
much
safety
as
possible
those
who
would
be
called
upon
to
leap
from
the
dizzy
heights
of
the
upper
floor
as
a
last
desperate
resort
to
save
their
otherwise
doomed
lives
a
distant
hubbub
growing
louder
as
it
drew
near
announced
the
approach
of
the
its
advent
was
hailed
with
lusty
shouts
and
fifty
volunteers
rushed
to
facilitate
its
arrival
but
impeding
and
retarding
its
progress
in
their
meritorious
desire
to
get
it
up
to
the
scene
of
disaster
as
quickly
as
possible
this
was
the
state
of
things
when
hal
looked
out
of
window
to
ascertain
where
the
fire
had
broken
out
a
downward
glance
at
the
rolling
masses
of
smoke
and
intermittent
flashes
of
forked
flame
an
upward
glance
at
the
windows
where
huddled
together
were
the
shrinking
weeping
distracted
females
and
he
was
the
next
minute
in
front
of
the
house
making
a
mad
attempt
to
ascend
the
burning
staircase
the
fire
had
however
obtained
complete
possession
it
roared
and
licked
as
it
roared
every
particle
of
woodwork
within
its
reach
brightening
up
as
if
with
ferocious
glee
as
it
gained
strength
and
sending
forth
showers
of
coruscations
sparkling
and
glittering
seemingly
to
mark
as
a
festive
occasion
one
of
the
most
dreadful
visitations
to
which
human
society
is
occasionally
subjected
blinded
and
suffocated
hal
was
compelled
to
give
back
to
save
the
life
which
might
yet
be
successfully
employed
in
rescuing
that
of
others
as
he
reached
the
doorway
the
came
up
the
conductor
placed
it
against
the
wall
but
before
he
could
commence
his
perilous
ascent
a
light
youthful
figure
sprang
past
him
on
to
the
wheel
caught
in
his
hands
the
nearest
rundle
of
the
ladder
and
ran
lightly
upwards
followed
by
a
cheer
from
the
mob
and
a
shout
from
the
conductor
to
come
down
again
for
inexperience
no
matter
how
honorably
influenced
is
in
most
cases
a
sad
marplot
in
such
emergencies
surrounded
by
frightful
danger
exposed
to
fatal
consequences
by
a
false
step
or
an
error
in
judgment
the
safety
of
valuable
lives
hanging
upon
a
thread
experience
allied
to
calmness
and
cool
under
the
most
trying
contingencies
is
essential
to
successful
operation
in
these
cases
knowledge
is
indeed
power
to
know
how
to
act
and
when
to
act
what
to
use
and
how
to
use
it
with
the
necessary
courage
to
do
and
dare
all
that
may
be
required
is
the
battle
and
victory
rarely
fails
to
follow
it
when
it
is
properly
conducted
it
can
be
understood
therefore
why
the
conductor
of
the
who
had
saved
many
lives
enraged
at
the
act
of
hal
vivian
shouted
so
vehemently
to
him
to
return
he
knew
by
many
instances
that
such
a
proceeding
as
that
of
which
the
youth
was
guilty
while
it
imperilled
the
rescue
of
those
sought
to
be
saved
added
to
the
number
he
was
called
upon
to
preserve
his
own
life
was
always
in
jeopardy
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
to
which
he
was
quite
equal
and
it
was
vexing
to
find
another
placing
himself
in
peril
without
occasion
for
it
and
in
all
probability
doing
far
more
harm
than
good
quick
as
he
was
in
his
chase
after
hal
he
failed
to
reach
him
before
he
was
at
the
window
where
clustered
the
affrighted
girls
ere
he
could
clutch
hold
of
him
hal
sprang
on
the
and
was
the
next
instant
in
the
room
he
was
recognised
immediately
by
those
whom
he
came
to
deliver
flora
as
she
saw
form
upon
the
edge
of
the
window
and
witnessed
him
bound
into
the
room
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
as
the
light
from
the
street
flashed
upon
his
animated
excited
countenance
her
heart
received
upon
it
the
impression
of
a
face
it
was
not
likely
to
permit
easily
to
be
effaced
reward
you
vivian
she
exclaimed
hysterically
have
come
to
save
perish
with
you
he
replied
excitedly
i
will
not
leave
the
room
until
you
are
all
safely
bless
you
god
bless
you
sobbed
lotte
clinton
who
as
white
as
death
was
trembling
like
an
aspen
then
young
fellow
cried
the
conductor
putting
his
head
into
the
window
you
are
here
you
must
make
yourself
useful
and
be
as
cool
as
a
cowcumber
recollect
we
here
to
spend
a
week
shut
that
door
look
sharp
or
all
be
stifled
in
a
no
sooner
commanded
than
done
at
the
same
instant
the
clattering
of
feet
at
full
gallop
over
the
ringing
stones
the
heavy
rumble
of
whirling
wheels
the
rattling
cheers
of
a
mob
which
was
fast
growing
into
a
multitude
announced
the
arrival
of
the
first
practicable
by
this
time
lotte
was
placed
within
the
cradle
of
the
and
was
safely
lowered
down
to
those
beneath
a
roar
of
gratification
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
spectators
as
they
beheld
one
added
to
the
list
of
the
saved
hal
watched
until
lotte
was
lifted
out
of
the
escape
and
then
he
turned
to
flora
to
request
her
to
be
in
readiness
to
take
her
place
in
the
little
it
must
be
understood
that
these
operations
were
performed
with
the
utmost
rapidity
consistent
with
safety
the
room
was
more
than
half
filled
by
a
dense
smoke
when
hal
entered
and
although
the
door
was
since
closed
it
had
streamed
in
through
crannies
and
chinks
so
as
to
fill
it
the
open
window
rather
holding
it
in
the
room
than
suffering
it
to
escape
when
lotte
and
her
companion
the
conductor
of
the
departed
the
atmosphere
had
become
heated
and
stifling
it
was
also
so
thick
that
scarcely
a
thing
a
foot
off
could
be
distinguished
astonishment
and
alarm
can
be
imagined
when
on
the
return
of
the
cradle
he
spoke
to
flora
and
received
no
answer
but
a
moment
past
and
she
was
at
his
elbow
she
was
now
gone
he
could
not
see
her
he
called
to
her
but
received
no
reply
he
felt
about
the
room
but
he
was
nearly
suffocated
without
succeeding
in
finding
her
he
heard
the
roaring
of
the
flames
beneath
him
the
smoke
grew
each
moment
thicker
and
denser
large
drops
of
perspiration
poured
from
him
instinctively
he
cowered
to
the
floor
and
spread
his
hands
in
all
directions
afraid
to
open
his
mouth
for
fear
of
being
stifled
the
conductor
of
the
now
poked
his
head
into
the
window
and
shouted
for
the
pair
to
save
their
lives
while
they
had
a
chance
but
he
received
no
answer
he
leaped
into
the
room
and
threw
himself
on
the
floor
groping
about
upon
his
hands
and
knees
he
uttered
a
shrill
cry
but
met
with
no
response
he
persevered
as
long
as
he
could
breathe
but
without
meeting
the
bodies
of
either
the
youth
or
the
maiden
it
was
his
impression
that
overpowered
by
the
smoke
they
had
sunk
senseless
upon
the
floor
but
he
could
nowhere
find
them
and
at
last
mystified
and
all
but
suffocated
he
was
compelled
to
retreat
to
the
window
the
fire
was
at
the
door
of
the
room
shooting
its
long
forks
of
flame
into
the
old
wood
of
which
it
was
composed
and
with
such
intense
heat
that
it
was
quickly
one
mass
of
flame
and
sputtering
sparks
with
a
heavy
heart
the
conductor
got
out
of
the
room
on
to
his
machine
and
he
was
barely
upon
it
when
a
long
blast
of
flame
followed
him
with
the
speed
of
lightning
and
darted
out
of
both
windows
cracking
and
smashing
the
fragile
glass
panes
causing
them
to
fly
in
all
directions
playing
fantastically
over
and
wreathing
up
the
architraves
of
the
windows
lighting
up
as
it
did
so
the
excited
faces
of
the
swaying
yelling
mob
below
the
conductor
slid
down
the
escape
and
communicated
the
appalling
intelligence
that
in
the
burning
rooms
above
were
two
miserable
young
creatures
who
by
the
time
he
was
relating
the
occurrence
had
become
shapeless
blackened
charred
masses
of
human
clay
the
scene
had
now
grown
intensely
exciting
more
engines
had
arrived
and
hundreds
of
persons
were
added
to
those
already
assembled
a
body
of
policemen
were
employed
in
forcing
the
turbulent
crowd
back
so
as
to
give
the
firemen
room
for
their
exertions
the
street
was
turned
into
a
river
and
the
fire
brigade
accoutred
like
the
heavy
dragoons
of
a
former
period
were
plashing
through
the
muddy
stream
getting
their
engines
into
working
order
with
the
systematic
and
as
it
appeared
to
the
anxious
gazers
the
rather
apathetic
regularity
of
organised
action
frantic
occupiers
of
adjoining
houses
were
flinging
out
their
furniture
their
little
all
and
that
uninsured
the
beds
and
chairs
tables
and
drawers
formed
as
they
were
brought
or
thrown
hastily
into
the
streets
a
motley
jumble
some
of
them
being
borne
away
by
active
parties
never
more
to
be
returned
to
the
original
owner
persons
burned
to
death
was
a
cry
which
ran
through
the
crowd
and
was
again
and
again
by
the
individuals
of
which
it
was
formed
a
thrill
of
horror
accompanying
it
wherever
it
went
an
explosion
and
up
shot
a
body
of
flame
into
the
air
attended
by
a
shower
of
sparks
fragments
of
burning
wood
and
flaming
articles
the
volumes
of
smoke
of
gold
and
tint
rolling
away
painfully
contrasting
with
the
heavens
the
roof
was
gone
a
brilliant
glare
was
thrown
over
all
objects
far
and
near
making
the
place
around
as
light
as
day
lo
a
sudden
and
tremendous
cry
burst
from
the
agitated
multitude
pressing
crowding
and
crushing
upon
the
foot
and
roadways
there
look
there
burst
from
a
thousand
throats
and
as
many
hands
pointed
to
a
particular
spot
the
adjoining
house
to
now
a
burning
mass
had
a
tall
irregular
but
pointed
roof
as
though
two
rooms
had
been
built
above
the
old
roof
of
much
less
dimensions
than
those
beneath
at
the
smallest
possible
cost
and
with
an
utter
disregard
of
architectural
rule
up
the
jagged
side
of
this
slanting
erection
a
human
figure
was
observed
climbing
slowly
his
arm
encircling
a
form
all
in
white
his
position
was
terrifyingly
dangerous
the
least
slip
and
he
together
with
his
burden
would
be
precipitated
into
the
burning
ruins
still
roaring
spluttering
and
flaming
below
him
he
lay
almost
flat
upon
his
face
on
the
rough
tiles
his
right
hand
grasping
the
carved
edge
of
the
angle
of
the
roof
gradually
he
worked
his
hand
upwards
and
by
a
tremendous
exertion
of
strength
he
drew
himself
and
his
companion
up
a
foot
at
each
movement
it
was
desperate
labour
a
fearful
struggle
with
death
it
seemed
to
those
who
gazed
upon
him
a
mere
impossibility
that
he
could
save
himself
and
the
girl
whom
he
still
clutched
round
the
waist
on
he
went
slowly
the
bright
flames
lighting
him
in
his
task
but
reducing
his
strength
by
the
intense
heat
they
threw
out
he
succeeded
in
getting
one
leg
across
the
angle
of
the
roof
but
in
doing
so
he
slipped
back
at
least
two
feet
a
shriek
of
horror
burst
from
the
crowd
and
rose
up
in
the
air
like
a
the
youth
did
not
yet
despair
but
with
desperate
exertion
he
arrested
his
descent
with
his
knees
he
paused
but
a
moment
and
renewed
his
efforts
to
ascend
using
his
knees
now
to
enable
him
to
maintain
his
position
on
the
roof
while
he
elevated
his
body
so
as
to
extend
his
reach
until
he
obtained
a
hold
higher
than
before
that
he
might
thus
ultimately
gain
a
place
of
comparative
safety
it
was
hal
vivian
who
was
with
flora
wilton
in
this
frightful
situation
he
had
crawled
in
search
of
her
into
an
adjoining
apartment
to
that
which
he
had
entered
from
the
street
she
had
hurried
thither
to
save
something
to
which
she
knew
her
father
attached
great
importance
but
overpowered
by
the
smoke
she
had
after
securing
it
fallen
senseless
hal
fortunately
found
her
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
room
and
the
reflection
from
the
fire
below
enabled
him
just
to
see
the
window
he
tore
it
open
and
saw
that
the
parapet
adjoined
the
roof
of
the
next
house
he
sprang
on
to
it
and
commenced
the
perilous
task
of
endeavouring
to
escape
a
horrible
death
and
of
saving
with
his
own
a
life
he
esteemed
far
more
valuable
the
falling
roof
of
the
house
he
had
just
quitted
when
it
sank
with
its
dreadful
crash
was
within
an
ace
of
taking
him
with
it
it
was
a
fearful
moment
but
he
surmounted
it
and
attempted
to
proceed
at
the
instant
the
crowd
caught
sight
of
him
he
heard
not
their
cry
saw
nothing
thought
not
of
aught
but
the
endeavour
to
reach
a
place
of
safety
with
her
he
strained
every
nerve
and
sinew
to
accomplish
his
object
but
human
endurance
though
backed
by
the
urgings
and
influence
of
a
strong
will
has
its
limits
he
now
reached
that
point
when
with
sickening
dismay
he
found
his
strength
failing
him
and
although
his
firmness
and
determination
were
unshaken
his
power
to
go
on
was
departing
to
slacken
his
tenacious
hold
was
to
be
hurled
into
the
yawning
gulph
of
fire
behind
him
he
knew
this
well
that
knowledge
had
as
yet
sustained
him
and
he
clung
to
the
roof
still
with
desperation
resolved
notwithstanding
the
quivering
of
his
fingers
the
agonising
aching
of
the
arm
which
supported
flora
and
the
trembling
of
his
knees
to
continue
to
the
last
his
exertions
to
save
the
maiden
or
to
pass
out
of
life
with
her
slowly
rising
up
as
before
he
made
a
clutch
at
the
top
of
the
roof
and
caught
it
but
he
found
that
beyond
drawing
himself
and
the
form
of
the
senseless
girl
a
little
higher
he
could
do
no
more
it
required
an
effort
of
unusual
strength
to
reach
the
summit
where
he
believed
he
could
remain
safe
until
rescued
and
that
effort
exhausted
nature
was
incapable
of
making
nay
he
felt
that
he
could
but
a
few
minutes
longer
cling
there
and
if
some
aid
did
not
reach
him
his
almost
superhuman
exertions
would
have
been
made
in
vain
he
remained
motionless
trying
to
recover
his
spent
breath
and
while
in
this
position
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
people
thronging
in
the
streets
reached
his
ears
and
seemed
to
rouse
him
from
his
slowly
approaching
listless
inanition
he
breathed
a
prayer
a
thought
what
flora
yet
might
be
to
him
and
what
that
great
world
of
which
he
had
yet
seen
so
little
might
have
in
store
for
him
flashed
through
his
brain
the
effect
upon
him
was
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
to
the
soldier
at
the
moment
of
some
fearful
charge
in
which
death
is
the
alternative
of
glory
he
drew
himself
upwards
struggling
with
the
obstacles
which
seemed
to
try
and
force
him
backwards
and
almost
with
a
scream
upon
his
lips
he
found
himself
oscillating
upon
the
spot
he
had
with
such
trying
exertion
sought
to
reach
exhausted
and
unable
to
make
another
effort
a
shadow
fell
upon
him
he
turned
his
feeble
eyes
upon
the
occasion
of
it
and
saw
one
of
the
fire
brigade
who
having
laid
a
short
ladder
against
the
side
of
the
roof
had
mounted
it
and
reached
him
behind
this
man
rose
up
the
helmet
of
a
second
fireman
closely
following
his
comrade
in
his
work
of
mercy
hal
knew
at
a
glance
that
flora
and
himself
were
saved
he
no
longer
strove
to
continue
the
battle
with
fate
and
did
not
attempt
to
resist
the
embrace
of
insensibility
as
he
felt
the
grip
of
the
fireman
upon
his
collar
and
heard
undistinguishable
words
fall
from
him
greeting
him
chapter
the
noble
guests
have
deserted
me
where
am
i
now
not
in
your
heart
while
care
weighs
on
your
brow
no
no
you
have
dismissed
me
and
i
go
from
your
breast
houseless
ay
ay
it
must
be
so
he
answered
john
keats
grahame
though
greatly
agitated
at
the
sudden
appearance
and
abrupt
disappearance
of
nathan
gomer
at
a
moment
of
such
dread
importance
did
not
make
any
comment
upon
it
to
chewkle
he
felt
unequal
to
such
a
task
and
perhaps
too
he
thought
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
suppose
that
the
strange
little
moneyed
man
had
either
observed
or
suspected
any
foul
play
in
the
act
he
must
have
seen
in
commission
so
he
folded
his
arms
and
remained
silent
assuming
the
aspect
of
profound
meditation
chewkle
finding
the
coast
clear
of
the
small
enemy
would
have
given
free
vent
to
the
feelings
which
were
turbulent
and
in
turmoil
within
him
but
grahame
repressed
the
very
first
outbreak
be
silent
on
the
matter
he
observed
hastily
as
if
aroused
suddenly
from
a
fit
of
abstraction
speculations
upon
the
situation
are
worth
nothing
and
may
lead
us
astray
if
suffered
to
have
the
rein
keep
what
you
know
safely
locked
within
your
own
breast
trust
the
key
in
my
keeping
alone
your
reward
shall
not
certainly
be
less
than
your
expectations
gomer
doubtless
saw
me
affixing
a
signature
to
a
deed
and
would
presume
it
to
be
my
own
he
could
not
imagine
the
truth
and
therefore
though
startled
at
the
moment
i
do
not
upon
reflection
see
any
occasion
for
alarm
let
me
see
you
again
in
a
few
days
my
good
friend
and
in
the
meantime
endeavour
to
suggest
a
mode
of
bringing
that
wretchedly
obstinate
old
man
wilton
to
grahame
rang
a
sharply
and
whelks
instantly
was
in
the
room
chewkle
a
thing
to
say
which
had
strong
reference
to
an
immediate
pecuniary
supply
but
grahame
did
not
afford
him
the
opportunity
for
he
addressed
whelks
as
he
entered
and
bade
him
escort
chewkle
to
the
door
he
tendered
a
finger
to
the
commission
agent
as
a
parting
salute
honoured
him
with
a
stiff
bow
and
retired
promptly
to
the
further
end
of
the
library
way
if
you
please
exclaimed
whelks
to
chewkle
as
with
head
erect
and
shoulders
back
he
with
the
stateliness
of
a
tartar
soldier
in
an
drama
marched
out
of
the
room
chewkle
glanced
at
grahame
and
at
whelks
he
had
a
pressing
occasion
for
a
few
pounds
but
though
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
for
and
have
a
sum
and
indeed
in
a
private
on
his
way
thither
that
morning
he
had
composed
the
conversation
which
was
to
take
place
between
himself
and
grahame
and
which
was
to
terminate
in
a
princely
act
of
munificence
towards
him
on
the
part
of
the
latter
personage
he
found
himself
sneaking
out
treading
on
the
shadow
of
whelks
without
having
uttered
a
word
or
having
obtained
a
penny
the
princely
act
of
munificence
did
not
come
off
upon
this
occasion
but
he
promised
himself
that
before
long
it
should
and
ere
he
was
out
of
the
house
he
had
flung
his
friendship
for
grahame
to
the
winds
and
had
carved
for
himself
an
antagonistic
attitude
in
which
he
played
the
part
of
one
who
having
in
his
possession
a
dreadful
secret
by
which
the
safety
of
another
is
compromised
makes
money
by
it
frequently
as
the
door
closed
upon
him
grahame
turned
a
fitful
gaze
in
that
direction
and
quickly
but
silently
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
then
he
paced
up
and
down
the
library
almost
convulsed
by
a
fierce
mental
struggle
he
pressed
his
burning
palm
upon
his
aching
forehead
and
muttered
rapidly
and
wildly
must
be
done
now
there
is
no
escape
no
escape
none
retreat
is
utterly
impossible
and
the
advance
must
be
swift
or
in
spite
of
crime
utter
crushing
ruin
must
be
the
result
no
there
is
no
stopping
now
that
forgery
is
useless
worthless
while
he
lives
to
prove
it
what
it
is
but
how
dispose
of
him
without
having
any
apparent
connection
with
his
death
let
me
see
i
must
have
no
accomplice
i
already
have
one
too
many
he
will
be
a
thorn
in
my
side
i
can
see
that
but
there
is
time
enough
to
think
of
the
plan
by
which
i
shall
get
rid
of
him
but
this
wilton
he
must
die
and
that
immediately
yes
he
must
die
he
must
die
or
i
perish
but
how
to
kill
him
how
how
he
threw
himself
in
his
chair
and
racked
his
brain
for
a
device
by
which
to
accomplish
his
devilish
purpose
without
compromising
himself
but
as
he
did
so
the
magnitude
of
the
crime
he
proposed
to
effect
was
not
lost
upon
him
he
felt
that
his
face
was
livid
his
hands
cold
and
clammy
while
drops
of
icy
sweat
trickled
from
his
temples
on
to
his
cheek
bones
his
teeth
too
chattered
and
his
limbs
trembled
as
though
he
had
been
suddenly
nipped
by
a
frost
some
hours
elapsed
before
his
torturing
reverie
terminated
even
then
he
had
only
an
indistinct
notion
of
the
course
which
he
calculated
upon
as
the
best
to
be
adopted
the
vulgar
modes
of
knife
or
poison
he
foresaw
could
not
be
employed
by
him
because
he
would
have
to
be
connected
however
remotely
with
the
deed
and
how
to
accomplish
his
design
without
the
aid
of
one
or
the
other
was
a
problem
harder
for
him
to
work
out
than
the
most
difficult
in
the
four
to
an
indifferent
mathematician
he
certainly
hit
upon
a
scheme
but
he
was
not
sure
that
it
would
accomplish
the
object
in
view
there
was
not
however
time
to
project
a
plan
requiring
consummate
skill
in
its
details
and
rare
ability
to
execute
need
was
driving
and
the
ground
was
such
as
the
devil
must
cover
without
the
option
of
a
choice
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
act
at
once
for
he
required
immediately
the
funds
which
the
successful
execution
of
his
infamous
purpose
would
place
at
his
disposal
as
if
to
sustain
him
in
the
resolution
he
had
formed
he
was
aroused
by
the
arrival
of
whelks
at
the
library
door
who
when
it
was
opened
informed
him
that
his
son
had
just
returned
home
accompanied
by
the
duke
of
allborne
and
the
honorable
lester
vane
and
that
they
awaited
him
in
the
dismissing
whelks
with
a
message
to
the
effect
that
he
would
immediately
join
them
he
hastened
to
his
to
obliterate
all
traces
of
the
mental
struggle
he
had
for
so
many
hours
endured
and
making
a
slight
alteration
in
his
attire
he
descended
with
solemn
step
and
slow
to
welcome
his
guests
upon
their
arrival
from
college
he
found
on
entering
the
gorgeously
furnished
apartment
his
wife
and
daughters
entertaining
the
new
arrivals
after
the
manner
of
the
house
always
excepting
evangeline
who
sat
back
in
a
window
recess
as
if
she
had
no
business
there
a
few
words
of
stately
congratulation
and
welcome
from
grahame
and
the
whole
party
returned
to
the
position
which
it
occupied
when
he
entered
the
keen
eye
of
grahame
ran
over
the
forms
of
the
two
young
men
who
were
thus
introduced
into
his
family
for
the
first
time
and
naturally
the
young
duke
was
the
first
to
attract
his
attention
he
was
tall
over
six
feet
and
stout
with
his
height
he
was
fair
with
round
blue
eyes
a
small
mouth
and
no
whiskers
upon
his
cheeks
or
moustache
upon
his
upper
lip
or
the
sign
of
a
hair
in
the
vicinity
his
hands
and
feet
were
small
but
there
was
a
bulky
plethoric
character
about
his
frame
and
his
legs
had
an
ungraceful
leaning
to
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
rich
and
not
unmusical
but
like
many
members
of
the
aristocracy
his
tongue
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
letter
and
as
a
not
unusual
consequence
he
used
words
containing
that
letter
more
frequently
than
did
persons
who
could
sound
it
like
the
roll
of
a
drumstick
upon
a
he
was
dressed
elegantly
the
jewellery
he
wore
though
spare
in
quantity
was
superb
in
material
and
costly
the
honorable
lester
vane
was
of
an
entirely
different
stamp
and
could
perhaps
have
better
sustained
the
character
of
a
duke
than
his
friend
standing
about
five
feet
ten
he
was
remarkably
and
erect
and
seemed
to
be
at
least
six
feet
high
he
was
dark
and
though
not
a
military
man
wore
a
and
trimmed
moustache
his
features
were
regular
and
his
eyes
were
a
very
dark
blue
and
shaded
by
long
black
eyelashes
his
hair
and
whiskers
being
of
the
same
hue
as
the
latter
his
hands
were
white
and
small
and
his
feet
were
equally
neat
in
their
proportions
he
was
dressed
with
consummate
taste
and
care
and
of
all
men
was
calculated
to
attract
the
notice
of
women
malcolm
grahame
short
in
stature
was
a
rather
ugly
likeness
of
his
sister
margaret
possessing
all
her
pride
but
not
enough
of
her
studied
coldness
to
prevent
it
becoming
vulgar
arrogance
he
was
rather
overdressed
too
and
altogether
presented
a
remarkable
contrast
to
his
college
companions
it
was
soon
perceptible
that
he
toadied
them
and
that
they
both
held
him
at
no
very
flattering
height
in
their
estimation
why
then
did
they
accompany
him
home
an
answer
to
that
question
might
have
been
found
in
the
glances
bestowed
by
both
the
young
men
on
the
beautiful
helen
grahame
who
conscious
of
her
own
charms
received
the
homage
of
their
eyes
as
simply
her
due
they
were
both
very
shortly
after
their
introduction
aware
that
she
interpreted
their
looks
of
admiration
rather
steadfastly
bestowed
that
they
did
not
surprise
nor
did
they
abash
her
nay
when
to
show
her
power
she
flashed
those
brilliant
orbs
upon
them
by
turns
with
a
clear
steadfast
gaze
they
were
fain
to
let
their
eyelids
fall
to
screen
their
unsteady
eyes
from
the
direct
unfaltering
look
she
bent
upon
them
both
regarded
her
in
the
light
of
a
prize
worth
having
though
each
looked
on
the
achievement
from
a
different
point
of
view
one
seriously
hoped
to
win
it
without
the
formulary
of
the
wedding
ring
the
other
with
that
aid
but
with
the
addition
also
of
a
golden
store
helen
grahame
was
unquestionably
beautiful
the
heightened
colour
of
her
cheek
the
sparkling
dancing
of
her
brilliant
eye
as
she
observed
the
impression
her
personal
attractions
had
made
upon
the
two
young
highborn
men
greatly
enhanced
that
beauty
which
excited
admiration
even
when
in
repose
it
kept
them
at
her
side
and
engrossed
the
largest
share
of
their
attention
with
a
quickness
of
perception
helen
saw
that
she
should
soon
have
both
these
men
suitors
for
her
favour
sighing
at
her
feet
for
her
love
the
gracefully
fashioned
form
of
lester
vane
pleased
her
eye
and
taste
the
ducal
coronet
of
his
bulky
friend
roused
her
ambition
and
dazzled
her
and
she
foresaw
that
she
should
be
perplexed
when
as
she
instinctively
knew
would
be
the
case
both
wooed
her
which
to
prefer
it
was
something
to
have
a
handsome
for
a
husband
but
to
be
a
duchess
ah
why
at
the
moment
did
she
sigh
so
sharply
why
did
a
spasm
run
through
her
frame
and
make
her
clutch
convulsively
at
a
chair
for
support
was
it
that
this
momentary
pang
reminded
her
that
in
neither
decision
would
her
heart
be
enlisted
or
that
there
was
another
and
more
grave
consideration
which
rendered
such
a
speculation
a
forbidden
subject
after
the
which
usually
attend
an
introduction
grahame
suggested
that
the
guests
should
be
shown
to
their
respective
rooms
where
they
might
remove
the
traces
of
their
journey
and
prepare
their
toilet
for
dinner
to
be
served
at
eight
a
suggestion
which
was
somewhat
readily
accepted
and
appeared
to
be
grateful
to
all
parties
the
duke
and
the
honorable
lester
vane
had
heard
malcolm
grahame
boast
of
his
beautiful
sister
helen
and
his
proud
sister
meg
they
had
availed
themselves
of
his
apparently
unlimited
command
of
money
and
they
considered
that
his
family
were
enormously
wealthy
but
vulgar
and
when
malcolm
invited
them
home
to
spend
a
week
with
him
at
his
in
london
they
both
having
of
their
own
in
the
great
city
looked
upon
the
invitation
as
a
good
joke
and
accepted
it
in
the
same
spirit
they
each
resolved
to
add
to
the
favours
they
had
bestowed
upon
him
by
permitting
him
always
to
pay
by
borrowing
his
money
in
return
for
their
company
and
by
running
off
with
the
pretty
sister
of
whom
he
spoke
so
enthusiastically
they
had
even
entered
into
a
bet
with
each
other
as
to
which
would
prove
successful
they
were
however
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
the
grahames
living
in
a
style
of
elegant
luxury
and
the
members
of
it
displaying
a
pride
of
bearing
not
even
surpassed
by
the
ineffably
proud
somerset
himself
whose
wife
a
percy
never
attempted
the
liberty
of
kissing
him
they
were
equally
posed
to
find
the
pretty
sister
a
brilliant
beauty
who
could
only
be
approached
with
deference
and
humility
who
was
not
to
be
gained
with
a
glance
of
passion
or
won
by
the
pretended
asseverations
of
a
love
having
no
existence
lester
vane
saw
his
course
at
once
his
income
was
narrow
and
during
his
life
would
not
be
increased
by
inheritances
or
bequests
from
any
branch
of
his
family
near
or
remote
to
gain
a
beautiful
wife
with
an
enormous
dowry
was
precisely
the
means
by
which
he
purposed
elevating
himself
to
wealth
and
within
a
few
minutes
after
his
introduction
to
helen
he
abandoned
his
criminal
project
and
took
up
the
matrimonial
one
he
formed
the
determination
too
of
thwarting
promptly
and
effectually
the
designs
without
appearing
to
do
so
until
he
was
sure
of
the
lady
because
he
knew
not
when
and
how
he
might
require
his
interest
and
service
the
young
duke
was
quite
thrown
out
too
by
what
was
presented
to
his
astonished
eyes
malcolm
grahame
after
all
was
not
the
he
had
fancied
him
to
be
and
his
sister
instead
of
being
merely
a
pretty
silly
girl
was
one
to
grace
a
throne
his
was
not
a
nature
easily
to
abandon
a
resolution
once
formed
and
he
thought
of
helen
as
a
mistress
with
a
gratified
emotion
not
to
be
described
a
passion
for
her
was
at
once
raised
in
his
heart
he
too
remembering
his
bet
with
lester
vane
made
his
resolutions
in
respect
to
the
intentions
of
his
friend
but
as
his
own
in
that
particular
remained
unchanged
he
decided
upon
preserving
silence
respecting
it
for
the
present
both
the
young
men
were
therefore
glad
to
escape
to
their
rooms
to
recover
their
surprise
on
finding
themselves
in
an
atmosphere
they
had
not
expected
and
in
contact
with
persons
differing
materially
from
the
conceptions
they
had
formed
of
them
they
were
anxious
to
reflect
upon
their
line
of
conduct
during
their
stay
and
having
well
considered
the
path
to
choose
to
follow
it
out
the
two
girls
and
their
mother
were
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
comparing
notes
and
devising
plans
to
be
carried
out
so
long
as
their
guests
remained
grahame
seemed
to
be
in
a
dream
glad
to
be
away
from
everybody
yet
hating
to
be
alone
a
brilliant
dinner
was
served
at
the
appointed
hour
as
there
was
no
point
of
resemblance
in
the
characters
of
those
present
save
in
those
of
margaret
grahame
and
her
mother
the
conversation
was
certainly
not
monotonous
it
afforded
however
an
opportunity
for
those
interested
in
such
a
task
to
observe
and
mentally
comment
upon
their
companions
and
to
draw
conclusions
to
be
treasured
up
for
future
use
the
duke
of
allborne
was
placed
on
the
right
hand
of
grahame
the
honorable
lester
vane
on
the
right
of
grahame
the
duke
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
having
the
fair
helen
as
his
right
hand
neighbour
and
lester
vane
was
honoured
with
the
company
of
margaret
for
which
he
was
not
disposed
to
be
especially
grateful
evangeline
faced
her
brother
malcolm
and
thus
arranged
they
proceeded
to
discuss
the
various
courses
to
partake
of
the
choicest
wines
to
converse
and
to
gaze
upon
each
other
the
last
item
was
by
no
means
the
least
important
the
duke
did
his
best
to
engross
the
conversation
of
helen
and
to
keep
his
round
light
blue
eyes
settled
upon
her
which
she
affected
only
to
observe
now
and
then
by
accident
then
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
turned
the
corners
of
her
mouth
the
deep
blue
eyes
of
lester
vane
rarely
left
her
face
even
when
he
was
addressed
by
others
as
often
as
she
turned
hers
in
his
direction
which
with
a
motive
she
did
occasionally
she
perceived
his
earnest
dreamy
gaze
fixed
upon
her
twice
or
thrice
it
made
her
shudder
she
knew
not
why
it
was
fixed
expressive
teeming
with
passion
but
if
it
possessed
fascination
it
was
that
of
the
serpent
insensibly
every
now
and
then
her
eyes
wandered
towards
his
and
settled
for
a
moment
upon
them
each
was
conscious
of
the
effect
they
were
creating
and
when
helen
averted
hers
a
strange
dread
thrilled
through
her
frame
now
although
the
beautiful
face
of
this
girl
absorbed
so
much
of
gaze
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
there
was
another
face
possessing
great
claims
to
loveliness
at
the
table
at
first
the
timid
reserve
of
evangeline
had
caused
him
to
pass
her
over
unnoticed
but
now
that
she
sat
almost
opposite
to
him
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
her
she
was
attired
in
a
dinner
dress
of
pale
blue
and
silver
and
being
very
fair
looked
charming
her
gentleness
and
quietness
prevented
her
attracting
much
attention
to
the
duke
she
was
mixed
up
with
the
lights
the
plate
and
malcolm
grahame
but
the
eye
of
vane
marked
her
down
must
fall
in
with
her
when
she
is
alone
he
thought
in
the
morning
or
in
byeways
she
can
be
made
i
am
sure
to
believe
and
to
keep
a
secret
at
any
once
more
his
eye
fell
upon
helen
who
was
turning
her
dark
bright
eyes
upon
the
duke
and
electrifying
him
with
her
beauty
while
she
confused
him
by
the
smartness
of
her
sallies
will
have
her
mused
lester
vane
may
be
a
task
surrounded
with
almost
insuperable
difficulties
but
i
will
have
margaret
claverhouse
grahame
divided
her
attentions
between
her
plate
and
the
young
duke
she
had
estimated
lester
vane
at
pretty
much
his
value
and
therefore
did
not
trouble
her
head
any
more
about
him
she
fastened
her
gray
eyes
upon
the
duke
as
often
as
her
dinner
would
admit
and
she
came
to
the
same
conclusion
respecting
him
that
lester
vane
had
with
her
sister
helen
must
be
mine
he
is
fat
and
awkward
she
thought
he
is
a
duke
and
i
am
born
to
bear
the
rank
of
a
on
the
period
appointed
by
etiquette
for
the
ladies
to
retire
arriving
the
young
ladies
led
by
grahame
quitted
the
apartment
to
leave
the
gentlemen
to
their
wine
they
were
now
on
much
more
familiar
terms
with
each
other
and
as
the
ladies
retired
the
duke
rising
with
the
gentlemen
said
to
helen
miss
gwahame
i
gwow
evwy

moah
and
moah
convinced
that
the
wegulation
which
dwove
the
ladies

society
though
only
faw
a
time
was
absolutely
bawbawous
and
the
pwesent

of
the
most
admiwable
kind

my
hospitable
host
count
the
minutes
until
we
join
you
in
the
dwawing
i
exclaimed
lester
vane
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
compelled
helen
to
turn
towards
him
their
eyes
met
again
she
felt
a
strange
thrilling
dread
pass
over
her
frame
she
turned
her
eyes
away
am
grateful
she
responded
with
a
bow
and
hastily
quitted
the
room
with
her
mother
and
sisters
she
did
not
enter
the
but
ran
into
her
own
and
throwing
herself
in
a
chair
buried
her
face
in
a
handkerchief
she
gave
way
to
a
passionate
burst
of
tears
presently
she
drew
from
her
bosom
a
small
note
broke
the
seal
and
perused
its
contents
many
times
and
then
she
crushed
it
in
her
hand
inopportune
she
exclaimed
in
a
vexed
tone
night
but
this
still
the
terms
are
so
peremptory
what
is
to
be
done
she
looked
at
her
watch
is
the
hour
she
said
if
i
let
it
pass
by
and
go
not
we
part
then
to
meet
no
more
no
no
that
must
not
be
oh
fickle
heart
to
what
fate
will
you
drive
me
at
this
moment
her
maid
entered
the
room
and
she
hastily
secreted
the
note
she
mused
for
a
second
and
then
she
said
give
me
a
shawl
i
will
walk
in
the
garden
my
head
is
very
dark
miss
returned
the
girl
the
air
is
getting
cold
it
will
be
dangerous
to
your
health
to
walk
there
me
a
shawl
chayter
cried
helen
impatiently
is
my
pleasure
to
walk
there
my
brain
the
girl
knew
it
was
useless
to
remonstrate
further
and
handed
her
a
thick
shawl
which
she
threw
hastily
over
her
head
and
left
the
room
in
a
moment
she
returned
and
said
that
dress
i
bade
you
alter
this
morning
you
may
thank
you
miss
exclaimed
the
girl
joyfully
for
it
was
a
rich
one
chayter
remain
here
until
you
see
me
remember
that
if
i
am
sent
for
to
say
that
i
am
lying
upon
my
couch
for
a
few
minutes
and
do
not
wish
to
be
not

a
word
to
any
one
that
i
have
gone
to
the
to
a
soul

good
girl
i
will
reward
you
on
my
as
she
concluded
she
hastened
down
the
private
staircase
got
a
sweetheart
swear
murmured
chayter
reflectively
find
that
out
see
if
i
that
will
be
many
a
dress
in
my
helen
hurried
on
tiptoe
until
she
reached
one
of
the
parlours
which
had
a
window
opening
on
to
the
lawn
she
passed
out
thence
closing
the
window
silently
after
her
she
kept
upon
the
lawn
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
for
a
short
distance
and
then
pursuing
a
winding
path
did
not
pause
until
she
reached
a
small
thicket
of
trees
planted
on
the
banks
of
a
tongue
of
land
curving
the
ornamental
waters
here
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
then
she
coughed
thrice
a
voice
whispered
and
she
clapped
her
hand
the
next
instant
there
issued
from
the
thicket
a
young
man
who
immediately
placed
himself
at
her
side
feared
you
would
not
come
dearest
he
said
in
a
low
tone
hugh
she
answered
was
indeed
a
task
difficult
to
execute
but
you
so
earnestly
wished
me
to
meet
you
that
i
am
is
shameful
of
me
to
doubt
you
helen
after
the
proofs
of
affection
which
you
have
bestowed
upon
me
yet
i
know
the
full
value
of
my
prize
and
i
so
fear
to
lose
you
still
love
me
hugh
she
asked
thoughtfully
you
oh
helen
why
do
you
ask
that
terrible
question
have
i
changed
in
look
in
word
in
thought
in
act
he
exclaimed
earnestly
she
said
no
yet
do
you
not
think
a
time
may
come
when
your
love
for
me
will
be
diverted
to
another
you
not
hugh
imagine
a
time
when
one
fairer
less
exacting
more
gentle
than
myself
may
win
from
me
that
love
you
say
i
now
alone
possess
this
language
affrights
me
i
do
not
understand
it
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
then
added
passionately
it
is
not
for
you
to
hazard
such
a
terrible
supposition
i
love
you
helen
i
have
sworn
it
i
shall
never
change
never
swerve
from
that
adoration
that
idolatry
with
which
i
worship
you
oh
we
are
about
to
part
for
a
time
helen
and
is
this
a
moment
to
raise
such
doubts
she
remained
silent
he
pressed
his
clenched
hand
upon
his
heart
and
said
with
deep
emotion
i
repeat
we
are
about
to
part
you
can
not
have
met
me
to
tell
me
that
the
love
you
have
declared
for
me
the
love
which
you
have
proved
and
which
i
have
oh
so
fondly
so
dearly
cherished
has
faded
suddenly
away
at
a
moment
and
you
wish
that
the
separation
commencing
now
should
last
for
ever
you
dare
not
do
it
no
no
hugh
no
she
cried
earnestly
he
ejaculated
in
low
but
deep
tones
as
though
his
very
existence
depended
upon
her
answer
have
as
i
believe
proved
to
me
that
you
loved
me
you
love
me
still
do
you
not
yes
yes
hugh
she
returned
with
fervour
do
indeed
hugh
love
you
with
my
whole
she
sank
upon
his
breast
and
he
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
passionately
at
this
instant
there
was
the
sound
of
a
footstep
upon
the
gravel
path
she
sprang
from
his
embrace
sake
be
silent
she
whispered
she
turned
her
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
advancing
footsteps
and
saw
approaching
the
spot
where
she
stood
with
her
companion
the
honorable
lester
vane
chapter
love
awakening
oh
love
no
habitant
of
earth
thou
art
an
unseen
seraph
we
believe
in
thee
a
faith
whose
martyrs
are
the
broken
heart
but
never
yet
hath
seen
nor
shall
see
the
naked
eye
thy
form
as
it

made
thee
as
it
peopled

even
with
its
own
desiring
phantasy
and
to
a
thought
such
shape
and
image
given
as
haunts
the
soul
wearied
wrung
and
riven
harold
a
sudden
involuntary
effort
of
the
memory
had
nearly
cost
flora
wilton
her
life
in
that
dreadful
moment
when
the
house
in
which
she
had
for
years
resided
was
a
prey
to
the
raging
flames
when
her
own
escape
owing
to
the
fearful
rapidity
with
which
the
fire
gained
ascendancy
was
a
question
of
doubt
she
had
remembered
a
packet
of
papers
which
her
father
had
given
into
her
charge
with
injunctions
to
preserve
it
even
at
the
hazard
of
her
life
it
had
been
placed
by
herself
in
a
spot
which
though
secret
was
yet
of
easy
access
to
obtain
it
would
be
but
the
act
of
a
minute
the
conductor
had
yet
to
return
to
convey
her
from
the
burning
house
to
the
street
below
and
she
made
the
attempt
simultaneously
with
the
conception
of
the
thought
the
room
she
entered
was
densely
filled
with
smoke
she
obtained
the
object
of
her
search
she
remembered
no
more
when
again
consciousness
returned
to
her
she
was
in
the
arms
of
hal
high
in
the
air
upon
a
dreadful
slope
the
ruddy
glare
of
the
roaring
flames
making
visible
to
her
the
frightful
danger
of
her
position
she
relapsed
into
insensibility
and
when
once
more
she
opened
her
eyes
she
found
herself
in
bed
the
motherly
face
of
an
elderly
woman
bending
over
her
and
her
wrist
in
the
hand
of
a
medical
attendant
who
had
himself
applied
the
restoratives
which
had
brought
her
back
to
life
a
thousand
questions
thronged
to
her
lips
first
wonder
then
incoherence
then
with
an
awakening
sense
of
what
had
happened
her
desolate
destitute
condition
burst
with
full
force
upon
her
and
she
fell
into
a
passionate
fit
of
weeping
the
soft
kindly
voice
of
the
woman
at
her
side
was
addressed
to
her
in
soothing
tones
while
the
strictest
injunctions
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
doctor
forbidding
speech
on
either
side
he
recommended
flora
to
commend
herself
to
god
and
then
endeavour
to
sleep
under
the
conviction
that
the
fearful
event
in
which
she
had
borne
so
prominent
a
part
had
not
involved
any
loss
of
life
poor
flora
she
had
no
words
at
command
no
language
in
which
to
express
the
emotions
the
horrors
of
the
night
had
occasioned
and
she
obeyed
the
behest
of
silence
simply
because
her
tongue
refused
its
office
she
listened
to
the
exhortations
addressed
to
her
and
made
a
feeble
motion
to
the
effect
that
she
would
endeavour
to
comply
with
the
wishes
that
had
been
expressed
and
so
she
was
left
alone
where
was
she
she
cast
her
weeping
eyes
around
but
in
the
room
recognised
no
object
that
could
enlighten
her
upon
that
point
by
the
aid
of
the
light
of
the
candle
which
had
been
left
burning
upon
a
table
she
could
distinguish
everything
in
the
room
plainly
enough
but
there
was
nothing
to
tell
her
whose
house
she
was
within
but
she
had
a
surmise
women
quick
at
assumption
are
rarely
far
wrong
in
their
suppositions
flora
when
she
opened
her
eyes
to
find
herself
at
a
dizzy
height
above
the
uproar
of
the
excited
multitude
assembled
to
witness
the
destruction
of
the
dwelling
by
the
remorseless
fire
saw
too
that
she
was
in
the
firm
grasp
of
harry
vivian
she
remembered
that
now
and
she
was
led
to
believe
therefore
that
she
had
been
conveyed
by
him
to
the
house
of
his
uncle
and
that
the
kind
and
tender
matron
who
had
spoken
to
her
such
words
of
tenderness
was
his
aunt
her
lip
quivered
as
the
thought
passed
through
her
mind
and
when
following
the
counsel
of
the
doctor
no
less
than
the
dictates
of
her
own
pure
mind
she
offered
up
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
to
the
throne
of
grace
for
her
escape
she
invoked
a
blessing
upon
the
head
of
him
who
had
perilled
so
much
to
accomplish
the
work
of
her
deliverance
it
has
been
said
that
it
is
seldom
a
woman
disposes
of
her
own
heart
circumstances
decide
for
her
one
thing
is
certain
that
she
does
not
long
remain
in
ignorance
when
her
heart
has
been
made
captive
a
man
may
for
some
time
believe
and
assure
himself
that
he
only
admires
and
esteems
some
very
pretty
girl
an
accident
will
however
disclose
to
him
that
he
loves
her
this
is
not
the
case
with
woman
a
man
upon
whom
she
casts
at
first
an
indifferent
eye
may
possess
attractions
which
gradually
gaining
her
good
will
ultimately
win
her
affections
but
her
heart
will
no
sooner
be
his
than
she
becomes
cognizant
of
the
fact
and
she
takes
her
position
accordingly
flora
had
been
present
many
times
when
hal
vivian
had
visited
her
father
upon
business
she
had
been
irresistibly
struck
by
his
handsome
face
and
figure
his
pleasant
expression
of
countenance
and
his
mild
courteous
manner
but
if
she
had
then
thought
of
him
at
all
it
was
to
consider
him
as
an
amiable
young
man
bearing
the
palm
perhaps
from
every
other
she
had
as
yet
seen
nothing
more
now
as
she
sought
to
close
her
eyes
in
sleep
she
saw
vividly
his
face
the
bright
red
glow
of
the
fire
glaring
upon
it
she
saw
his
glittering
eye
his
contracted
brow
his
inflated
nostril
and
compressed
lip
the
collective
symbols
of
brave
energy
she
saw
too
that
the
contour
was
handsome
and
noble
with
an
almost
painful
distinctness
she
perceived
that
the
daring
effort
of
courage
which
then
so
brilliantly
animated
his
fine
face
was
solely
made
to
save
her
from
a
dreadful
death
while
giving
him
full
credit
for
the
very
noblest
impulse
she
had
not
been
true
to
her
nature
if
she
had
not
instinctively
felt
that
his
arduous
exertions
received
an
impetus
from
some
favourable
impression
she
had
created
upon
him
indefinite
unacknowledged
as
this
conception
in
her
agitated
state
really
was
it
was
not
without
its
influence
in
composing
her
to
slumber
her
dead
pale
face
seemed
to
look
down
upon
her
from
its
place
in
heaven
gently
and
placidly
her
countenance
quivering
with
an
agonised
anxiety
of
expression
disturbed
and
sorrowful
oppressed
her
but
the
features
of
hal
floated
before
her
vision
appearing
to
grow
brighter
and
brighter
in
her
eyes
and
to
suggest
a
hopeful
and
happy
future
it
was
broad
daylight
when
she
awoke
she
turned
her
pained
eyes
around
her
and
beheld
at
her
side
again
that
same
kind
motherly
face
which
had
been
the
first
she
looked
upon
the
night
before
when
recovering
from
insensibility
she
was
greeted
with
kind
words
as
on
the
previous
occasion
and
was
permitted
this
time
not
only
to
recur
mentally
to
the
sad
event
of
the
night
before
but
to
obtain
some
control
over
her
natural
emotions
before
a
question
was
put
to
her
which
called
upon
her
to
utter
a
word
during
this
interval
she
learned
that
all
her
surmises
had
been
founded
on
a
true
basis
that
she
was
indebted
to
hal
vivian
for
an
almost
miraculous
escape
from
a
dreadful
death
and
that
she
had
been
received
and
sheltered
beneath
the
roof
of
harper
where
she
was
assured
that
she
was
welcome
to
remain
until
some
arrangements
for
her
comfort
and
convenience
could
be
made
further
flora
was
given
to
understand
that
the
good
samaritan
before
her
was
harper
who
though
she
had
servants
in
the
house
believed
that
her
own
ministrations
to
the
suffering
girl
would
be
attended
with
more
beneficial
results
than
if
she
had
delegated
the
task
to
others
harper
was
a
truly
generous
woman
and
her
efforts
to
serve
others
had
at
least
the
gratifying
effect
of
rewarding
herself
for
hitherto
she
had
been
so
fortunate
as
not
to
misplace
them
or
throw
them
away
on
unworthy
objects
her
doves
of
pity
and
goodwill
had
always
brought
her
back
an
olive
branch
and
if
they
had
not
it
is
doubtful
whether
she
would
have
ceased
to
render
those
services
which
came
so
opportunely
and
were
so
grateful
to
whoever
needed
them
when
flora
could
command
herself
to
speak
she
in
warm
and
eloquent
terms
expressed
her
deep
and
earnest
gratitude
for
that
bravery
which
the
nephew
of
harper
had
exhibited
in
the
behalf
of
herself
and
to
the
goodness
and
charity
of
the
old
lady
who
in
her
distress
had
granted
her
so
valuable
an
asylum
speak
of
it
my
child
returned
harper
my
part
i
wish
my
hospitality
had
been
afforded
to
you
under
happier
circumstances
and
as
for
hal
heaven
bless
us
i
thought
i
should
have
died
when
i
saw
him
crawling
with
you
up
the
roof
of
that
horrible
old
house
over
the
way
sure
i
never
expected
to
see
you
come
down
alive
either
of
you
and
in
truth
i
believe
you
would
if
it
been
for
those
bold
firemen
who
mercy
on
us
were
up
in
the
flames
moving
about
like
a
parcel
of
demons
in
the
fiery
regions
in
the
play
flora
clasped
her
hands
and
said
sorrowfully
perilling
of
life
for
me
and
i
can
in
no
way
repay
tut
my
dear
returned
harper
think
about
that
these
men
are
paid
for
their
work
it
is
their
duty
and
they
are
used
to
vivian
suggested
flora
what
i
said
my
dear
observed
harper
garrulously
is
neither
paid
for
nor
used
to
such
work
but
when
i
said
so
he
closed
my
mouth
with
a
kiss
and
vowed
that
it
was
his
duty
that
he
had
performed
and
if
it
was
to
do
again
he
would
not
hesitate
one
minute
to
go
through
all
he
did
last
is
so
noble
said
flora
with
the
faintest
of
sighs
fellow
ejaculated
harper
looks
rather
jaded
this
morning
and
so
odd
with
his
whiskers
and
eyebrows
singed
with
the
fierce
fire
ah
it
was
a
dreadful
exclaimed
flora
with
a
shudder
and
he
was
so
eager
to
know
how
you
were
continued
harper
me
what
a
many
questions
he
asked
me
about
you
ah
well
i
told
him
you
should
yourself
reply
to
him
bye
and
flora
was
conscious
of
a
rosy
hue
stealing
into
her
cheek
she
thought
of
his
deep
earnest
eyes
and
how
steadfastly
they
would
after
the
late
event
settle
upon
hers
and
how
she
would
never
be
able
to
meet
his
though
she
had
at
other
times
and
recently
done
so
without
even
a
passing
thought
upon
the
matter
why
was
this
she
sighed
perhaps
she
guessed
it
was
some
two
or
three
days
before
she
was
enabled
to
grant
an
interview
to
hal
anxious
as
she
was
for
the
meeting
all
her
clothes
had
been
consumed
by
the
fire
and
dresses
were
world
too
for
her
flora
was
not
affected
on
the
point
of
dress
she
had
no
unnecessary
or
false
pride
in
that
respect
but
she
had
the
natural
regard
to
external
appearance
which
every
woman
young
or
old
unless
utterly
lost
possesses
and
though
she
was
not
truly
cognisant
of
the
influence
a
tasteful
arrangement
of
garments
would
have
in
heightening
charms
already
of
a
very
superior
order
she
had
no
desire
to
present
herself
to
harry
vivian
disguised
in
a
dress
sufficiently
capacious
for
harper
but
in
no
degree
to
her
dimensions
with
most
generous
spirit
and
charming
willingness
the
old
lady
put
the
powers
of
her
draper
and
her
dressmaker
into
active
requisition
and
flora
was
able
to
quit
her
room
in
the
time
mentioned
she
rapidly
recovered
her
health
and
a
certain
serenity
of
mind
the
loss
of
all
her
little
property
buried
among
the
charred
ruins
opposite
was
an
evil
to
be
regretted
but
it
was
a
fact
which
no
grief
could
disturb
or
obviate
a
remedy
was
to
be
sought
something
was
to
be
done
for
herself
probably
for
her
father
too
who
an
inmate
of
a
prison
was
scarcely
likely
to
be
able
to
help
himself
and
from
the
moment
she
came
to
recognise
and
comprehend
her
position
her
mind
busied
itself
in
forming
plans
for
the
future
by
which
she
should
at
least
be
able
to
support
him
who
had
no
one
now
in
the
wide
wide
world
to
look
up
to
but
herself
she
was
hopeful
and
sanguine
but
she
knew
very
little
of
the
world
old
harper
knew
a
very
great
deal
about
it
plain
and
as
he
appeared
he
had
for
some
time
past
determined
to
have
a
country
house
at
islington
in
fact
had
decided
upon
it
and
was
slowly
having
it
furnished
he
pushed
on
the
work
now
for
after
a
very
grave
consultation
with
harper
his
wife
he
decided
that
the
poor
girl
bereaved
of
home
by
fire
and
of
a
father
by
the
law
could
not
turn
out
into
the
streets
so
looking
upon
her
as
a
trust
confided
to
his
care
by
the
almighty
he
resolved
to
take
charge
of
her
house
feed
and
clothe
her
until
something
was
done
in
her
behalf
by
such
persons
as
had
a
better
title
to
perform
the
good
work
than
himself
thus
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
calculated
upon
entering
his
new
house
at
highbury
which
he
should
leave
in
the
morning
and
return
to
at
night
accompanied
by
his
nephew
and
he
resolved
that
flora
wilton
should
become
an
inmate
as
well
as
those
who
constituted
his
family
he
absolutely
chuckled
to
think
what
a
delightful
companion
she
would
make
his
wife
who
having
lived
so
long
in
the
old
house
in
clerkenwell
would
find
the
solitude
of
her
new
home
without
such
society
as
that
now
ready
for
her
absolutely
insupportable
harper
confided
to
hal
the
task
of
imparting
to
flora
his
intentions
owes
you
something
for
the
service
you
afforded
her
in
escaping
said
the
old
goldsmith
so
if
she
raises
any
foolish
objection
the
prompting
of
a
reluctance
to
become
burdensome
or
any
such
stuff
as
that
for
she
is
just
the
sort
of
girl
to
show
a
great
deal
of
pride
you
know
you
will
be
able
to
combat
her
arguments
and
reason
her
out
of
face
lighted
up
as
though
a
sunbeam
had
made
it
radiant
what
happiness
to
have
her
dwelling
at
his
home
her
eyes
to
greet
him
when
he
returned
at
night
and
follow
him
when
he
departed
in
the
morning
her
voice
to
welcome
him
and
to
speed
him
on
his
way
her
delicious
presence
to
smoothe
down
the
fatigues
of
his
daily
labour
and
to
wile
away
imperceptibly
hours
which
otherwise
might
drag
their
slow
length
tediously
along
harry
vivian
overflowing
with
instructions
and
his
own
emotions
of
delight
one
morning
by
arrangement
entered
the
room
in
which
flora
was
seated
alone
and
advanced
towards
her
shyly
and
slowly
flora
who
as
the
door
opened
turned
her
gaze
upon
it
as
though
she
knew
whose
gentle
hand
was
on
the
latch
ere
the
door
had
given
him
to
her
eyes
as
he
made
his
way
into
the
apartment
rose
up
the
colour
fled
from
her
cheek
and
she
was
seized
with
such
a
sudden
and
violent
palpitation
of
the
heart
that
she
was
forced
back
into
her
chair
again
she
trembled
all
over
then
her
cheek
flushed
and
she
felt
once
more
impelled
to
rise
and
hurry
towards
him
to
grasp
his
hand
and
pour
forth
a
torrent
of
eloquent
gratefulness
the
emotion
which
she
experienced
was
new
and
strange
to
her
her
every
nerve
thrilled
rather
with
a
sense
of
pleasure
rather
than
with
any
other
feeling
she
was
confused
dizzy
but
withal
an
overpowering
gladness
reigned
within
her
soul
that
he
and
she
were
once
more
face
to
face
ay
they
were
palm
to
palm
too
at
first
without
a
word
what
could
they
say
their
hearts
were
too
full
for
utterance
both
remembered
how
together
they
had
trembled
on
the
verge
of
eternity
and
there
was
a
deep
solemnity
in
the
thought
which
for
the
moment
forbade
speech
flora
was
the
first
wonderful
gift
pertaining
to
woman
to
recover
her
in
words
low
toned
but
earnest
and
heartfelt
she
expressed
her
sense
of
the
obligation
she
owed
him
and
though
he
recovering
too
his
speech
would
have
stayed
her
she
was
not
to
be
so
checked
but
gave
utterance
to
all
her
full
heart
dictated
my
own
life
i
am
your
debtor
i
am
sensible
what
i
owe
to
you
on
that
account
she
observed
with
much
feeling
i
can
never
never
discharge
the
obligation
nay
perhaps
i
would
not
if
i
could
for
indeed
vivian
after
the
brave
and
noble
conduct
you
have
displayed
it
affords
me
a
gratification
i
have
no
words
to
describe
to
know
that
i
shall
henceforward
be
attached
to
you
by
ties
of
gratitude
which
no
adverse
circumstances
can
ever
why
did
she
suddenly
turn
so
crimson
and
look
affrighted
at
the
words
which
she
herself
had
uttered
was
it
that
eye
danced
with
joy
or
that
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
pressed
it
with
them
well
it
matters
not
her
eye
fell
upon
the
ground
and
her
hand
remained
within
his
she
did
not
offer
to
withdraw
it
though
he
had
kissed
it
softly
and
tenderly
it
is
true
but
not
without
a
little
if
ever
so
little
he
had
not
seen
her
frightened
look
but
her
words
had
made
his
heart
leap
and
but
that
he
had
the
proposition
of
his
uncle
to
make
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
would
have
responded
to
them
by
confessing
that
her
attachment
however
ardent
was
fully
reciprocated
by
him
as
it
was
he
restrained
himself
dear
miss
wilton
he
said
in
a
somewhat
tremulous
tone
not
my
services
i
was
excited
by
the
occurrence
and
acted
upon
an
noble
one
not
uncommon
thousands
would
have
done
as
i
have
done
had
they
similar
opportunities
and
i
should
have
exerted
myself
equally
had
you
been
an
entire
stranger
to
i
believe
said
flora
innocently
and
is
to
say
continued
hal
correcting
himself
for
he
did
not
quite
like
her
to
entertain
that
belief
impression
is
that
i
should
i
must
acknowledge
miss
wilton
that
knowing
you
as
i
have
had
the
honour
of
doing
for
some
time
i
had
an
additional
incentive
to
endeavour
to
snatch
you
from
an
awful
death
i
very
much
congratulate
myself
that
i
succeeded
and
i
pray
you
to
believe
that
you
can
not
be
more
overjoyed
at
my
good
fortune
than
myself
thank
god
you
are
safe
and
i
hope
almost
recovered
from
the
fright
we
will
let
the
past
go
and
cast
an
eye
upon
the
have
already
done
so
interposed
flora
do
not
dispute
it
my
dear
miss
wilton
returned
he
speaking
quietly
yet
firmly
as
though
to
drown
all
opposition
my
uncle
has
been
beforehand
with
you
he
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
knows
much
he
is
a
wealthy
man
too
miss
wilton
and
can
well
afford
to
be
kind
considerate
and
generous
he
is
quite
alive
to
the
very
embarrassing
position
in
which
the
late
sad
disaster
has
placed
you
and
he
is
anxious
that
you
should
not
experience
its
inconvenience
during
the
interval
which
must
elapse
between
any
arrangements
you
may
be
able
to
make
hereafter
for
your
future
course
he
has
laid
out
his
plans
with
which
you
are
connected
he
confesses
that
they
are
not
without
a
little
selfishness
in
them
but
he
is
wishful
that
you
should
overlook
that
and
not
offer
any
opposition
to
the
proposal
he
has
empowered
me
to
make
to
he
then
in
the
most
delicate
words
he
was
able
to
employ
laid
before
her
his
plan
and
begged
her
to
assent
to
it
to
have
refused
under
present
circumstances
would
have
been
simply
a
preposterous
absurdity
she
had
no
such
notion
but
she
felt
this
additional
kindness
most
acutely
she
remained
silent
because
she
felt
that
she
should
sob
as
she
spoke
if
she
attempted
to
give
utterance
to
her
feelings
she
turned
her
large
eyes
suffused
in
tears
upon
him
he
was
easily
able
to
read
their
language
with
instinctive
delicacy
desirous
of
sparing
her
further
distress
from
painful
recollections
he
terminated
the
interview
here
in
a
rejoiced
spirit
he
interpreted
her
look
of
overflowing
gratitude
as
an
acceptance
of
his
liberal
offer
and
he
once
more
pressed
her
unreluctant
hand
as
relieving
her
of
any
necessity
for
speaking
he
informed
her
that
he
should
convey
to
his
relative
her
judicious
decision
upon
the
matter
if
he
were
not
in
love
now
it
is
more
than
doubtful
if
ever
he
could
be
during
the
period
which
had
elapsed
between
the
rescue
and
the
present
moment
flora
had
not
for
an
instant
forgotten
her
father
the
expression
of
dire
misery
which
pervaded
his
features
when
he
parted
from
her
in
custody
of
jukes
and
sudds
remained
present
to
her
as
vividly
as
though
it
had
been
photographed
upon
her
vision
it
haunted
her
and
added
greatly
to
the
sad
impression
with
which
the
recent
occurrences
and
several
afflicting
events
had
clouded
her
young
life
in
the
years
immediately
past
she
wished
so
much
to
see
her
father
again
to
be
with
him
to
minister
to
his
wants
and
to
his
comforts
to
both
of
which
she
felt
assured
he
had
no
one
to
attend
and
must
therefore
be
plunged
into
a
state
of
despairing
wretchedness
in
accepting
the
offer
of
harper
she
saw
in
no
selfish
or
spirit
that
she
would
in
her
present
dreadful
strait
be
at
least
provided
with
a
home
until
some
means
were
obtained
to
place
her
where
she
would
be
no
longer
a
burden
to
harper
and
she
had
not
therefore
hesitated
thankfully
to
fall
in
with
the
arrangement
proposed
yet
she
desired
to
be
the
companion
and
loving
attendant
upon
her
father
in
prison
in
prison
how
that
dreadful
word
rang
in
her
ears
she
had
but
a
vague
notion
of
that
receptacle
for
vice
dishonesty
and
misfortune
she
had
no
clear
perception
of
the
difference
between
the
and
the
place
of
incarceration
to
her
it
was
one
huge
black
building
frowning
and
grim
in
its
aspect
without
all
cells
chains
and
torture
within
to
some
such
a
place
she
believed
her
father
to
have
been
borne
she
shrank
not
to
share
his
captivity
she
had
a
sense
that
the
air
would
be
foul
stifling
pestiferous
and
the
cell
wanting
the
light
of
day
she
pictured
four
black
mildewed
walls
a
straw
bed
always
damp
with
slime
and
dank
with
humid
earth
a
small
wretched
table
a
pitcher
of
water
and
a
lump
of
dark
noisome
bread
she
had
heard
of
such
places
there
might
be
some
alleviation
where
the
crime
was
only
inability
to
pay
but
a
prison
was
still
a
prison
and
hopeful
as
she
might
be
that
his
condition
was
not
so
bad
yet
she
could
see
it
in
no
other
light
to
harper
she
revealed
her
wishes
but
that
good
lady
not
only
had
a
difficulty
in
believing
in
its
practicability
but
even
in
its
propriety
harper
was
consulted
and
he
hastened
to
set
flora
right
not
suppose
he
said
wilton
that
i
have
overlooked
the
situation
of
your
father
common
humanity
would
have
forbidden
that
i
made
it
my
duty
to
send
to
him
as
early
as
the
gates
of
the
establishment
where
he
is
detained
were
open
on
the
morning
after
the
fire
to
let
him
know
that
the
sad
disaster
had
happened
but
that
his
child
was
safe
in
my
charge
i
further
caused
him
to
be
informed
that
as
soon
as
you
were
able
to
leave
your
chamber
you
would
go
to
him
and
explain
all
that
i
was
unable
to
sir
let
me
go
to
him
at
once
cried
flora
eagerly
you
feel
strong
enough
certainly
replied
harper
sir
i
am
quite
strong
enough
quite
indeed
i
am
i
so
long
to
see
him
i
have
so
much
so
very
much
to
say
to
it
so
hal
shall
accompany
you
to
protect
you
you
can
not
go
it
would
not
be
well
to
do
so
through
the
agency
of
some
unknown
friend
a
writ
of
has
been
obtained
and
your
father
has
been
removed
from
whitecross
street
to
the
prison
all
of
which
you
do
not
understand
however
there
he
is
and
the
place
is
one
of
which
you
can
have
no
conception
the
assemblage
there
is
large
mixed
and
not
scrupulous
in
its
behaviour
you
would
be
bewildered
without
some
one
to
make
inquiries
for
you
and
be
perhaps
rudely
assailed
by
the
unreflecting
or
the
callous
and
the
impertinent
yes
hal
shall
go
with
you
and
you
will
believe
me
find
the
prison
somewhat
different
to
the
picture
you
have
sketched
in
your
flora
listened
in
silence
and
acquiesced
in
the
arrangement
not
that
the
disagreeable
part
of
it
would
be
the
society
of
hal
nay
she
would
have
gone
with
jukes
rather
than
not
have
gone
at
all
malicious
ogre
as
she
considered
him
but
she
would
have
preferred
to
have
gone
alone
she
felt
an
intuitive
reluctance
that
hal
whom
she
so
much
esteemed
and
whom
therefore
she
would
have
wished
to
have
seen
her
relatives
in
their
best
light
should
visit
her
father
in
a
prison
and
that
the
visit
should
be
paid
with
her
but
inexorable
circumstances
compelling
she
set
out
with
him
her
small
hand
resting
upon
his
arm
and
making
him
feel
a
far
wealthier
and
happier
potentate
than
any
monarch
that
ever
reigned
upon
earth
chapter
the
prison
a
divinity
doth
shape
our
ends
rough
hew
them
how
we
will
hamlet
when
they
together
reached
the
lodge
or
gate
as
it
is
called
of
the
prison
hal
and
flora
gazed
with
surprise
on
the
motley
group
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
unlocked
that
they
might
enter
to
see
those
confined
within
a
sallow
faced
turnkey
who
seemed
all
eyes
was
what
is
called
the
lock
and
he
of
every
individual
about
to
pass
into
the
prison
with
a
sharp
scrutiny
and
with
a
rapidity
which
told
that
this
had
been
for
years
his
daily
practice
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
were
standing
there
together
elbow
to
elbow
the
shabby
man
who
acted
as
messenger
the
aristocrat
moustached
and
habited
in
the
latest
fashion
the
slatternly
dressed
woman
with
a
basket
containing
small
purchases
and
the
fine
lady
whose
husband
had
settled
a
fortune
upon
her
but
who
was
himself
for
a
few
thousands
and
whose
carriage
waited
without
the
gate
the
squalid
child
the
pampered
boy
the
virtuous
and
the
vicious
were
huddled
together
forming
no
indifferent
sample
of
the
congregation
gathered
within
the
embrace
of
the
high
brick
crested
walls
the
turnkey
who
had
been
reading
a
newspaper
with
one
eye
and
surveying
his
guests
with
the
other
having
found
the
collection
of
guests
large
enough
rose
slowly
up
and
opened
the
door
a
crowd
was
waiting
on
the
opposite
side
to
come
out
as
hal
with
his
young
and
beautiful
but
shrinking
companion
passed
the
turnkey
he
inquired
where
he
should
find
wilton
and
had
to
repeat
his
question
before
he
could
obtain
a
reply
at
last
as
the
way
was
being
stopped
up
because
hal
with
the
blood
tingling
in
his
forehead
refused
to
budge
until
he
obtained
his
answer
the
man
said
in
a
low
and
surly
tone
in
no
hal
passed
on
and
entered
a
long
quadrangle
where
he
saw
assembled
some
three
or
four
hundred
persons
of
all
descriptions
many
of
them
passing
away
their
hours
of
confinement
in
the
game
of
rackets
an
exclamation
of
surprise
burst
from
both
his
lips
and
from
her
visions
of
a
damp
horrible
dungeon
were
dissipated
in
a
moment
the
day
was
cloudless
and
as
the
sun
streamed
down
among
the
hordes
congregated
together
bustling
here
and
there
standing
in
groups
or
engaged
actively
at
rackets
laughing
shouting
or
speaking
in
high
tones
the
scene
appeared
more
like
a
community
enjoying
a
festival
day
than
a
body
of
prisoners
in
confinement
visited
by
condoling
friends
surprised
eyes
ran
eagerly
over
the
lively
masses
thronging
in
groups
or
moving
rapidly
to
and
fro
and
she
felt
a
great
weight
removed
from
her
heart
although
even
her
small
stock
of
worldly
knowledge
told
her
that
the
aspect
of
the
society
she
beheld
gathered
here
was
a
shade
shabbier
and
a
dash
more
slovenly
than
that
met
with
both
she
and
her
companion
were
slightly
confused
but
the
latter
after
a
curious
gaze
at
the
motley
multitude
turned
his
attention
to
the
object
with
which
he
visited
the
place
he
saw
upon
the
arched
doorways
leading
to
the
prison
chambers
a
painted
number
upon
the
and
shrewdly
guessed
at
the
explanation
of
in
no
which
had
at
first
a
little
mystified
him
before
he
could
advance
many
paces
an
experienced
eye
picked
him
out
as
an
and
a
visitor
a
dingy
tattered
man
sallow
with
long
confinement
and
the
pressure
of
an
enduring
poverty
which
had
as
he
who
gave
it
as
a
toast
said
stuck
by
him
long
after
his
friends
had
deserted
him
touched
hal
on
the
elbow
here
i
see
he
observed
as
the
young
man
turned
sharply
around
to
see
a
friend
i
presume
if
you
will
honour
me
with
the
name
of
the
gentleman
residing
here
i
will
conduct
you
straight
to
his
room
if
you
find
him
there
search
for
him
among
the
players
sure
to
find
him
one
of
the
conveniences
of
this
establishment
is
that
the
friend
you
call
to
see
is
never
far
from
his
hutch
at
is
not
known
in
our
hal
saw
that
the
information
was
to
be
purchased
at
an
arbitrary
gift
he
felt
that
a
guide
was
unnecessary
as
the
information
he
had
received
from
the
turnkey
though
not
at
first
clear
was
plain
enough
now
yet
there
was
something
in
the
careworn
aspect
of
the
features
in
the
wistful
anxious
expression
of
his
eye
telling
of
the
strong
hope
he
had
now
before
him
of
obtaining
a
breakfast
so
that
hal
who
had
breakfasted
heartily
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
disappoint
his
expectations
and
after
a
perusal
of
the
poor
face
and
a
hasty
glance
at
his
threadbare
attire
he
said
want
to
see
a
wilton
do
you
know
where
he
is
situated
hal
had
almost
said
confined
but
he
arrested
the
word
ere
it
left
his
lips
wilton
repeated
the
man
is
a
new
comer
eh
is
replied
hal
returned
the
man
he
is
either
in
or
in
can
save
you
the
trouble
of
speculating
by
telling
in
interrupted
the
man
is
the
only
other
room
which
has
been
recently
occupied
the
lawyers
you
a
lawyer
sir
hal
laughed
freely
he
answered
am
not
a
to
hear
it
the
precious
rastals
they
have
been
driving
a
roaring
trade
lately
ah
sir
what
a
glorious
country
this
would
have
been
without
lawyers
no
writs
no
executions
no
imprisonment
for
debt
by
jove
what
a
splendid
state
of
the
man
shut
his
eyes
to
enjoy
the
ecstacy
he
felt
even
in
imagining
such
an
utopia
swindlers
no
doubt
observed
hal
with
a
smile
lawyers
are
essentially
necessary
to
prevent
honest
men
being
devoured
by
true
sir
that
is
one
side
of
the
question
if
they
confined
themselves
to
that
line
they
would
be
a
valuable
body
of
professionals
but
unfortunately
they
do
not
you
are
too
young
and
too
inexperienced
to
know
that
they
are
much
more
the
friend
than
the
honest
counsellor
and
hal
shook
his
head
you
know
i
hope
you
may
never
have
occasion
to
know
i
do
god
knows
i
do
i
have
been
here
eighteen
years
sir
never
in
all
that
time
beyond
the
door
through
which
you
entered
this
pandemonium
the
lawyers
brought
me
here
and
here
i
am
likely
to
you
take
the
the
act
no
i
am
here
for
contempt
of
court
a
contempt
of
which
i
am
intentionally
as
innocent
as
you
are
a
contempt
about
which
i
knew
nothing
yet
the
rascally
lawyers
clapped
me
in
here
for
it
and
here
i
have
been
ever
since
because
i
am
not
able
to
purge
my
contempt
as
they
call
it
besides
if
it
were
not
for
contempt
that
i
am
here
i
take
the
benefit
for
i
am
connected
with
a
large
property
and
i
intend
to
let
the
villains
have
that
simply
because
i
should
like
a
bird
be
glad
to
get
out
of
my
cage
however
sir
you
want
to
see
wilton
and
not
to
listen
to
my
doleful
history
come
along
sir
this
he
shuffled
onward
as
he
spoke
and
hal
prepared
to
follow
him
as
he
did
so
he
caught
sight
of
a
man
within
three
feet
of
him
fastening
a
stare
of
passionate
admiration
upon
sweet
face
his
gaze
was
impudent
only
so
far
as
that
it
was
fixed
and
steadfast
he
had
caught
sight
of
her
countenance
and
had
stopped
short
as
though
he
had
been
transfixed
suddenly
to
the
ground
he
was
about
forty
years
of
age
evidently
a
gentleman
probably
a
military
man
for
his
carriage
was
remarkably
erect
and
his
upper
lip
though
that
nowadays
is
no
symbol
of
the
profession
of
arms
was
garnished
with
a
thin
black
moustache
long
at
the
ends
and
having
the
appearance
of
being
perpetually
manipulated
by
the
finger
and
thumb
of
either
hand
his
complexion
was
very
dark
bearing
evidence
of
having
for
years
been
exposed
to
the
tender
mercies
of
an
indian
sun
his
eyes
were
a
brilliant
jet
and
unusually
large
they
flashed
as
he
moved
them
his
hair
which
was
short
was
black
as
were
his
whiskers
which
were
thin
and
polished
curling
at
the
edges
with
a
uniformity
that
spoke
of
irons
his
attire
was
plain
and
dark
but
that
of
a
gentleman
he
was
evidently
one
in
no
common
position
hal
ran
his
eye
scrutinisingly
over
him
and
then
turned
a
side
glance
at
flora
whose
face
he
perceived
to
be
flushed
and
its
expression
that
of
one
distressed
at
being
thus
rudely
stared
out
of
countenance
of
course
with
the
instincts
of
his
youth
he
felt
convulsed
with
a
jealous
rage
and
burned
to
commit
himself
in
some
wrathful
and
violent
way
as
flora
was
nearest
to
the
stranger
and
must
have
touched
him
as
she
passed
hal
moved
her
by
an
easy
act
setting
his
shoulder
firm
he
increased
his
pace
as
if
to
follow
the
messenger
and
came
into
sharp
collision
with
the
gentleman
who
had
not
yet
removed
his
eyes
from
the
face
of
flora
the
effect
of
the
concussion
was
to
thrust
him
back
some
two
or
three
feet
while
hal
passed
on
apparently
unmoved
another
minute
and
the
latter
felt
his
shoulder
rudely
seized
he
wheeled
round
instanter
the
man
he
had
pushed
out
of
his
path
was
at
his
side
his
features
distorted
with
rage
cub
he
cried
dare
you
thrust
yourself
against
me
are
quite
able
to
frame
the
explanation
if
you
require
one
and
to
comprehend
my
refusal
to
make
any
apology
returned
hal
with
calmness
me
also
counsel
you
not
to
repeat
the
offence
of
which
you
have
been
guilty
or
the
consequences
as
now
may
not
terminate
in
a
simple
he
moved
on
as
the
excited
individual
exclaimed
for
that
fair
creature
on
your
arm
i
would
have
caned
you
soundly
you
insolent
lip
curled
contemptuously
he
refrained
from
replying
to
the
threat
and
left
the
man
to
resent
his
conduct
in
any
shape
he
pleased
they
were
now
before
the
open
dooorway
no
and
followed
the
messenger
up
the
worn
stone
steps
that
looked
as
though
water
was
to
them
a
fable
and
grease
their
daily
food
by
the
aid
of
the
iron
banisters
and
arm
flora
with
beating
heart
reached
the
second
flight
and
saw
the
messenger
who
had
preceded
them
halting
in
the
stone
corridor
before
a
door
upon
it
was
painted
the
figure
this
then
was
in
and
within
the
room
which
that
painted
door
guarded
was
her
father
a
prisoner
still
there
was
no
grim
turnkey
no
dripping
walls
no
dark
dungeon
though
heaven
knows
the
vaulted
passages
lighted
by
small
arched
windows
looked
dreary
enough
is
the
place
said
the
messenger
room
where
wilton
is
staying
and
with
better
luck
than
i
have
ah
sir
my
friends
have
all
died
or
wandered
away
long
ago
and
i
without
them
or
help
of
any
kind
have
been
obliged
to
declare
myself
on
the
county
that
means
sir
that
i
am
supplied
with
a
room
and
a
scanty
allowance
of
food
by
the
authorities
but
not
a
farthing
in
money
sir
not
a
farthing
you
see
before
you
sir
a
wretch
who
has
not
a
farthing
nor
any
means
of
obtaining
one
save
through
the
charity
of
kind
persons
like
yourself
who
reward
me
with
a
trifle
for
conducting
them
to
their
hal
put
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
drew
forth
the
usual
reward
was
about
twopence
sometimes
by
the
a
penny
was
doled
out
or
a
profitless
you
but
that
was
munificence
with
economy
how
long
would
it
supply
him
with
tobacco
and
beer
the
eye
glistened
as
a
ray
of
light
fell
upon
the
coin
it
was
one
of
the
last
new
dies
and
was
bright
as
from
the
mint
a
beautiful
piece
of
silver
he
exclaimed
with
a
grin
of
satisfaction
you
a
gentleman
when
you
come
again

for
me

knock
and
see
whether
wilton

in
his
room
if
not
run
into
the
ground
and
hunt
him
flora
tapped
gently
at
the
door
but
there
was
no
response
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
lock
gently
and
opened
it
a
little
way
she
looked
into
the
apartment
with
a
throbbing
heart
upon
a
bed
she
saw
seated
her
father
the
very
picture
of
desolation
and
woe
his
head
was
bowed
almost
to
his
knees
and
his
two
hands
were
spread
open
over
his
forehead
he
seemed
unconscious
of
everything
but
the
intense
anguish
under
the
influence
of
which
his
body
was
swaying
to
and
fro
flora
ran
into
the
room
she
sank
upon
her
knees
at
his
feet
she
drew
gently
his
hands
from
before
his
eyes
and
twined
her
arms
about
him
with
a
sweet
tenderness
dear
father
she
said
up
see
your
own
has
come
to
you
to
be
with
you
to
share
your
prison
to
tend
you
and
to
be
a
comfort
to
you
as
she
was
at
home
look
at
me
speak
to
me
father
with
a
startled
cry
the
old
man
looked
up
as
if
suddenly
roused
out
of
a
dream
of
gloom
and
horror
into
a
paradise
of
sunshine
he
caught
soft
cheeks
between
his
withered
hands
and
gazed
upon
her
young
bright
lovely
face
with
an
expression
of
passionate
joy
lighting
up
his
wrinkled
pallid
features
he
cried
hysterically
my
my
not
dead
not
consumed
my
own
flo
not
lost
to
me
for
ever
oh
beneficent
creator
i
can
bear

sorrows

assuaged
come
what
come
may
i
care
not
for
my
child

spared
to
me
to
my
heart
my
darling
the
old
man
drew
her
to
his
breast
and
pressed
her
convulsively
there
sobbing
as
he
did
so
like
a
child
hal
with
water
glittering
in
his
eyes
turned
his
face
from
them
and
looked
out
upon
the
bustling
noisy
groups
in
the
racket
ground
beneath
shabby
josh
maybee
made
an
effort
to
clear
his
throat
as
if
he
had
swallowed
a
cobweb
and
felt
that
in
spite
of
all
his
economic
resolutions
at
least
twopence
of
the
would
instantly

melted
into
beer
he
darted
away
down
the
stone
staircase
two
steps
at
a
time
with
the
practised
agility
of
one
who
had
descended
them
many
hundred
times
as
soon
as
flora
could
disengage
herself
from
her
embrace
she
drew
his
attention
to
hal
who
had
all
the
time
modestly
remained
close
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
in
glowing
terms
she
related
to
him
the
part
which
he
had
played
in
the
dreadful
fire
the
origin
of
which
was
a
mystery
she
told
him
of
the
desperate
hazard
he
had
incurred
in
his
efforts
to
save
her
life
and
she
also
related
to
him
what
had
since
occurred
old
wilton
with
tears
in
his
eyes
thanked
him
vivian
he
said
feebly
day
may
be
distant
but
i
have
faith
that
it
will
come
when
i
shall
in
some
degree
be
able
to
repay
you
for
the
past
not
that
salvation
of
a
life
can
ever
be
meetly
rewarded
but
something
in
the
direction
may
be
achieved
some
service
may
be
needed
by
you
and
it
may
be
in
my
power
to
render
it
it
will
show
at
least
the
spirit
of
my
gratefulness
towards
you
vivian
i
have
not
always
been
the
abject
wretch
you
now
see
me
i
may
not
continue
to
be
such
ah
my
god
he
cried
putting
his
hands
to
his
forehead
as
though
smitten
with
sudden
agony
and
then
turning
to
his
astonished
daughter
who
was
regarding
him
with
an
affrighted
look
he
said
in
a
tone
of
unutterable
anguish
was
hopelessly
utterly
destroyed
in
that
dreadful
she
clasped
her
hands
bowed
her
head
and
replied
sorrowfully
everything
he
groaned
bitterly
fire
was
so
sudden
and
so
violent
observed
hal
gently
those
who
escaped
had
hardly
time
to
save
themselves
in
their
night
dresses
opportunity
was
barely
afforded
for
the
old
man
rose
up
and
paced
the
room
murmuring
in
accents
of
acute
misery
gone
all
gone
the
long
cherished
hope
of
years
the
one
link
which
through
all
my
misery
has
bound
me
to
life
everything
has
perished
my
long
long
sustained
hopefulness
is
swept
from
me
and
henceforth
there
is
nothing
left
but
misery
and
despair
dear
father
do
not
give
way
to
such
gloomy
fears
cried
flora
tenderly
caressing
him
cloud
has
long
hung
over
our
house
it
is
at
its
darkest
now
but
it
will
disperse
and
pass
never
cried
the
old
man
hoarsely
that
dread
fire
all
our
expectations
all
the
possibilities
of
restoring
them
are
consumed
we
might
have
been
wealthy
in
the
time
to
come
now
we
must
be
beggars
for
sorrows
overpower
your
better
reason
wilton
exclaimed
hal
pained
to
see
the
acute
grief
of
the
old
man
and
the
sharp
tears
of
anguish
coursing
down
the
cheeks
of
flora
whom
he
seemed
to
love
more
deeply
and
fervently
each
time
his
eye
traced
the
exquisite
beauty
of
her
features
old
wilton
turned
to
him
know
not
the
extent
of
my
loss
vivian
he
said
almost
sharply
can
not
therefore
measure
the
depth
of
my
then
addressing
his
daughter
he
said
my
child
i
am
to
blame
that
i
did
not
confide
to
you
the
true
value
of
that
document
which
i
charged
you
to
guard
with
your
life
had
i
done
so
you
have
saved
that
packet
cried
flora
eagerly
interrupting
him
returned
for
it
at
the
last
moment
and
i
should
have
died
when
i
secured
it
had
not
vivian
risked
his
life
to
follow
me
and
bear
me
through
flame
and
smoke
to
a
place
of
she
turned
a
soft
glance
upon
hal
as
she
said
this
which
made
his
heart
leap
again
old
wilton
stood
speechless
staring
upon
her
as
if
distraught
while
she
spoke
as
she
concluded
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
is
it
where
is
it
she
drew
from
beneath
her
mantle
a
small
packet
and
handed
it
to
him
he
clutched
it
with
trembling
fingers
he
ran
his
eye
eagerly
over
it
though
it
shook
in
his
hands
so
that
to
decipher
a
word
of
that
which
was
written
in
endorsement
upon
it
seemed
impossible
his
breath
went
and
came
in
short
convulsive
sobs
is
the
same
he
murmured
is
the
same
saved
saved
my
saved
the
last
words
sounded
feebly
and
he
staggered
as
if
he
was
about
to
fall
hal
rushed
forward
and
caught
him
in
his
arms
the
emotion
had
been
too
much
for
him
and
he
had
fallen
into
a
swoon
hal
laid
him
tenderly
on
his
bed
and
unloosed
his
neckcloth
while
flora
procuring
some
water
from
a
brown
pitcher
which
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
apartment
bathed
his
temples
and
his
lips
with
it
after
some
anxious
moments
spent
in
the
endeavour
to
restore
him
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
opened
his
eyes
they
fell
upon
his
face
close
to
his
own
her
soft
arm
was
his
pillow
and
her
gentle
hand
wiped
the
clammy
dew
from
his
forehead
you
better
dearest
father
she
asked
in
low
tones
better
he
ejaculated
happy
saved
he
pressed
her
cheek
to
his
and
they
mingled
their
tears
together
hal
knew
they
had
much
to
say
to
each
other
private
matters
to
communicate
the
past
to
speak
about
and
the
future
to
arrange
in
such
communion
he
felt
that
he
would
only
be
an
intruder
and
he
availed
himself
of
the
situation
to
say
would
gladly
be
alone
with
your
father
miss
wilton
you
have
much
to
talk
over
of
importance
which
my
presence
would
render
embarrassing
to
both
i
feel
a
curiosity
to
watch
the
proceedings
below
i
will
return
for
you
in
an
he
did
not
wait
for
the
answer
but
quitted
the
room
closing
the
door
after
him
good
and
generous
youth
exclaimed
old
wilton
gazing
after
him
that
all
the
world
were
like
him
flora
echoed
the
sentiment
but
in
silence
perhaps
too
she
had
her
thoughts
concerning
him
or
why
did
her
full
lid
droop
as
the
sound
of
his
descending
footstep
gradually
lost
itself
in
the
echoes
of
the
vaulted
passages
as
harry
vivian
entered
the
quadrangle
where
were
assembled
the
and
their
friends
and
satellites
he
gazed
around
upon
the
noisy
active
throng
uncertain
whither
to
bend
his
steps
he
impulsively
strolled
towards
the
farther
end
of
the
quadrangle
where
was
going
on
vigorously
as
he
moved
on
his
eye
suddenly
caught
sight
of
the
dark
military
looking
personage
who
had
so
rudely
stared
at
flora
wilton
and
whom
he
had
so
unceremoniously
ejected
from
his
path
he
was
in
close
conversation
with
old
josh
maybee
and
twice
or
thrice
during
their
conversation
he
pointed
to
no
and
josh
maybee
pointed
there
too
even
up
at
the
window
of
no
where
flora
was
with
her
father
not
for
an
instant
did
hal
doubt
that
flora
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
it
was
so
natural
for
him
to
surmise
it
the
moustached
man
had
stared
at
her
in
the
most
marked
manner
impertinently
and
rudely
as
hal
believed
he
was
struck
with
her
beauty
that
was
certain
he
could
hardly
be
to
blame
for
that
how
could
he
help
it
but
there
the
matter
ought
to
end
why
was
he
making
inquiries
about
her
as
it
was
very
evident
he
was
why
should
he
desire
to
know
who
and
what
she
was
perhaps
he
wished
to
see
her
again
and
to
speak
to
her
nothing
more
probable
according
to
calculation
of
consequences
he
thought
he
had
better
not
make
the
attempt
after
a
few
minutes
thus
occupied
the
tall
dark
gentleman
left
josh
maybee
and
walked
as
if
in
deep
thought
towards
the
end
of
the
quadrangle
josh
maybee
hurried
with
a
smiling
face
towards
the
doorway
where
hal
was
yet
standing
he
would
have
passed
but
hal
caught
him
by
the
arm
he
said
want
a
word
with
you
maybee
if
you
please
young
sir
cried
maybee
who
appeared
quite
excited
have
been
lucky
to
me
sir
just
had
a
crown
given
to
guess
who
gave
it
to
you
a
tall
dark
man
with
whom
you
were
just
now
very
same
returned
maybee
rubbing
his
hands
it
fair
to
ask
the
subject
of
your
conversation
observed
hal
hesitatingly
replied
maybee
caution
me
to
keep
what
was
said
to
myself
he
asked
me
first
of
all
who
was
that
pretty
girl
and
dear
heart
she
has
a
blessed
sweet
face
that
was
with
you
sir
and
i
told
him
that
i
know
then
he
gave
me
a
crown
piece
which
i
put
away
quickly
for
fear
he
should
ask
for
change
or
to
have
it
back
again
ah
there
aint
many
crowns
and
given
away
here
sir
exclaimed
hal
impatiently
was
not
all
that
passed
bless
you
no
sir
returned
maybee
turning
the
crown
over
the
and
the
over
the
crown
in
his
pocket
he
asked
me
where
i
conducted
you
to
i
told
him
in
he
asked
the
name
of
the
gentleman
you
went
to
visit
i
told
him
then
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
anything
about
wilton
and
i
told
him
no
was
he
a
scientific
man
i
said
i
know
had
he
come
up
from
the
country
i
tell
him
he
asked
me
a
good
many
more
such
questions
but
i
answer
him
then
he
said
he
was
himself
an
indian
officer
and
had
not
long
returned
he
had
been
away
a
long
long
time
he
said
but
he
knew
a
wilton
before
he
went
away
and
he
wondered
if
he
were
the
same
of
course
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
answer
that
question
and
then
he
wished
to
know
the
room
and
i
pointed
it
out
to
him
all
he
mention
his
own
name
inquired
hal
thoughtfully
sir
he
merely
said
he
was
an
officer
just
returned
from
india
nothing
more
responded
maybee
who
felt
more
disposed
for
the
twopennyworth
of
beer
he
had
promised
himself
than
ever
hal
let
him
go
in
less
than
a
minute
maybee
was
at
the
bar
and
a
foaming
pint
was
placed
before
him
hal
walked
up
and
down
reflecting
upon
this
event
he
looked
after
the
indian
officer
but
he
had
disappeared
and
though
he
remained
in
the
quadrangle
the
time
he
had
prescribed
for
himself
to
remain
away
from
apartments
he
saw
nothing
more
of
the
man
with
whom
he
had
come
into
collision
the
hour
having
passed
he
ascended
the
stairs
with
a
light
step
and
paused
before
the
door
of
no
he
fancied
he
heard
voices
within
and
knocked
gently
for
admission
his
summons
was
perhaps
not
heard
and
he
repeated
it
louder
in
the
interval
he
was
convinced
that
there
were
voices
which
he
did
not
recognise
and
this
lent
a
greater
firmness
to
his
knock
he
heard
old
voice
exclaim
in
and
he
entered
he
was
not
a
little
surprised
on
advancing
into
the
room
to
perceive
the
indian
officer
accompanied
by
a
young
dashingly
dressed
fellow
seated
far
too
near
to
flora
to
be
agreeable
to
him
old
wilton
was
standing
and
displayed
an
air
of
dignity
which
hal
certainly
had
never
seen
him
wear
before
there
was
a
silence
upon
his
entrance
and
the
indian
officer
gazed
upon
him
grimly
old
wilton
however
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
the
manner
of
a
gentleman
motioned
him
to
a
seat
and
then
turning
to
the
officer
said
was
about
to
ask
of
you
wilton
whether
you
ever
lived
in
devonshire
i
before
i
reply
permitted
to
ask
your
motive
in
questioning
me
you
a
i
have
just
returned
from
india
after
an
absence
with
one
short
exception
seventeen
years
one
of
my
first
objects
on
arriving
in
england
on
retiring
from
the
service
has
been
to
find
out
those
old
friends
dwelling
in
this
country
who
in
my
early
years
were
kind
and
generous
in
their
conduct
to
me
among
those
i
can
so
class
was
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
wilton
who
dwelt
at
harleydale
manor
devon
a
chance
glance
at
that
young
exquisite
face
awakened
memories
long
since
slumbering
and
the
accidental
mention
of
your
name
in
connection
with
it
led
me
to
seek
you
to
ask
whether
you
are
eustace
wilton
of
harleydale
manor
old
lip
quivered
he
drew
himself
up
erect
and
said
am
that
man
the
officer
rose
to
his
feet
and
grasped
his
hand
shaking
it
with
great
apparent
warmth
has
wrought
great
changes
in
us
both
he
said
am
colonel
mires
of
the
bengal
army
that
same
ensign
mires
whom
you
defended
at
a
moment
when
honour
reputation
family
life
itself
were
at
old
wilton
started
as
the
name
fell
upon
his
ears
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
face
of
the
officer
and
appeared
to
scan
every
lineament
then
uttering
an
exclamation
of
wonder
he
released
his
hand
from
the
grip
of
the
colonel
and
sank
into
his
seat
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
chapter
the
mystery
till
fate
or
fortune
near
the
place
his
steps
where
secret
palamon
was
laid
full
little
thought
of
him
the
gentle
knight
who
flying
death
had
there
concealed
his
flight
in
brakes
and
brambles
hid
and
shunning
mortal
strife
and
less
he
knew
him
for
his
hated
foe
but
feared
him
as
a
man
he
did
not
know
palamon
and
arcite
helen
grahame
with
her
hand
tightly
clutching
the
wrist
of
the
young
man
with
whom
she
had
been
in
such
tender
converse
retreated
noiselessly
into
the
deepest
shadows
of
the
small
thicket
where
they
had
met
and
there
stood
with
her
companion
as
the
honorable
lester
vane
advanced
motionless
though
greatly
agitated
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
her
guest
in
the
garden
at
such
a
moment
she
betrayed
no
outward
sign
of
emotion
she
could
hear
the
beating
of
her
heart
but
by
an
almost
superhuman
exertion
she
was
calm
collected
prepared
for
action
if
discovered
and
even
in
such
an
emergency
could
have
spoken
without
any
visible
symptom
of
embarrassment
the
honorable
lester
vane
paused
before
the
cluster
of
trees
he
even
took
a
step
or
two
as
though
to
enter
its
recess
helen
had
he
but
advanced
one
foot
more
would
have
emerged
from
her
place
of
concealment
and
with
some
ready
excuse
for
being
there
have
led
him
away
so
that
her
companion
might
have
escaped
unobserved
but
as
if
satisfied
that
it
possessed
no
outlet
he
turned
away
and
sauntered
slowly
and
thoughtfully
down
the
gravelled
path
by
a
separate
route
to
that
by
which
he
had
approached
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
hearing
helen
turned
to
her
companion
exclaiming
must
leave
you
hugh
and
at
once
nay
dearest
do
not
urge
me
to
remain
you
know
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
me
to
share
your
dear
society
for
hours
would
it
were
for
ever
but
it
would
be
madness
to
risk
discovery
for
a
few
minutes
of
stolen
i
can
not
part
from
you
thus
returned
the
youth
at
her
side
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
am
quitting
london
you
know
it
possibly
by
dawn
in
the
morning
and
these
may
be
the
last
few
precious
moments
i
may
pass
with
you
for
a
long
and
dreary
you
will
soon
return
hugh
she
said
with
a
seeming
conviction
that
his
absence
would
be
brief
he
shook
his
head
sadly
do
not
know
what
are
the
intentions
of
my
uncle
with
respect
to
my
future
movements
he
answered
know
only
that
i
am
ordered
to
be
in
readiness
to
proceed
at
a
notice
to
southampton
there
to
await
further
instructions
and
to
be
prepared
for
the
possibility
of
having
to
undertake
a
far
more
distant
more
distant
journey
hugh
i
have
very
powerful
reasons
for
believing
that
my
destination
is
an
exclamation
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
young
girl
a
thousand
thoughts
flashed
through
her
brain
at
the
vision
of
a
long
separation
from
him
who
now
addressed
her
alas
for
hugh
they
were
not
such
thoughts
as
he
could
have
wished
to
occupy
her
mind
she
would
regret
his
departure
unquestionably
but
it
brought
with
it
a
sense
of
liberty
a
freedom
of
action
an
unquestioned
license
for
listening
to
soft
words
from
other
lips
and
for
responding
to
meaning
glances
from
admiring
eyes
without
the
dullness
of
indifference
or
a
flash
of
scorn
the
suggestion
of
a
protracted
separation
brought
more
strongly
before
her
mind
the
ducal
coronet
of
the
young
peer
now
in
her
mansion
and
the
impressive
eyes
of
lester
vane
she
was
silent
her
mind
was
too
busy
to
permit
her
to
speak
a
word
she
had
involuntarily
uttered
an
exclamation
when
he
revealed
his
fear
that
he
was
about
to
leave
england
for
a
lengthened
term
and
he
attributed
her
subsequent
silence
to
the
grief
he
presumed
she
would
necessarily
feel
at
the
occurrence
of
an
event
which
to
him
was
distracting
he
twined
his
arms
about
her
waist
and
she
rested
her
beautiful
face
upon
his
shoulder
he
pressed
the
lips
thus
offered
up
to
his
own
and
with
a
groan
of
agony
murmured
helen
my
own
noble
beautiful
one
my
treasure
it
will
be
death
to
me
to
part
with
you
i
can
not
will
not
go
i
will
submit
to
any
sacrifice
rather
i
will
not
be
torn
from
you
for
in
truth
it
will
break
my
dearest
do
not
give
way
thus
she
rejoined
as
her
youthful
companion
under
the
intense
pressure
of
his
feelings
suffered
his
head
to
fall
upon
her
neck
and
sobbed
passionately
is
not
like
you
hugh
i
have
seen
you
brave
enough
in
desperate
peril
come
be
brave
now
remember
you
are
making
yourself
unhappy
upon
a
surmise
i
could
view
it
only
as
a
surmise
helen
he
returned
sadly
i
have
too
much
occasion
for
faith
in
the
presentiment
which
oppresses
childishness
hugh
we
have
parted
before
but
only
to
meet
again
and
with
increased
happiness
you
quitted
me
hopefully
you
have
returned
to
me
joyously
why
not
again
is
clear
helen
he
said
raising
up
his
head
and
dashing
away
the
tear
which
yet
trembled
on
his
cheek
you
can
contemplate
a
separation
with
calmness
and
expectation
of
meeting
you
soon
again
certainly
she
replied
his
quick
ear
detected
a
slight
coolness
and
a
little
impatience
in
the
tone
in
expectation
of
not
soon
meeting
again
he
asked
sharply
and
with
misgiving
imagine
that
which
is
not
likely
to
happen
she
returned
pettishly
have
told
you
that
it
i
do
not
comprehend
what
of
late
has
possessed
you
she
retorted
in
the
same
fretful
voice
have
suffered
the
most
ridiculous
fancies
and
chimeras
to
seize
upon
your
brain
and
you
not
only
make
yourself
miserable
but
you
seem
to
wish
to
compel
everybody
else
to
become
you
wrong
i
fear
i
do
not
even
when
you
must
have
been
conscious
that
to
accomplish
a
meeting
with
you
was
to
me
next
to
an
impossibility
you
insisted
upon
my
complying
with
your
request
and
you
bring
me
here
only
to
entertain
me
with
a
string
of
doubts
and
fears
which
are
not
worthy
of
he
started
and
released
her
hand
of
which
until
now
he
had
retained
possession
do
not
love
me
helen
he
exclaimed
passionately
as
he
recoiled
from
her
love
you
hugh
she
replied
throwing
up
her
head
angrily
are
ungrateful
sir
ask
your
reason
at
what
sacrifice
have
i
paused
for
you
you
at
least
have
had
proof
that
my
love
for
you
was
of
no
ordinary
character
you
helen
he
cried
falling
upon
his
knees
before
her
me
forgive
me
i
am
frenzied
at
the
prospect
of
losing
you
i
do
love
you
so
fondly
so
dearly
so
madly
that
death
in
any
shape
seems
to
me
preferable
to
being
torn
from
you
for
years
you
are
my
idol
its
worship
my
adoration
and
if
i
am
captious
full
of
strange
conceptions
and
dread
misgivings
attribute
it
alone
to
my
passion
for
you
my
helen
my
beloved
it
is
rarely
that
a
young
girl
who
is
possessed
of
genuine
tenderness
of
feeling
for
a
young
and
handsome
man
remains
an
indifferent
listener
to
his
ardent
expressions
of
passionate
devotion
helen
grahame
was
not
less
susceptible
in
this
particular
than
the
weakest
of
her
sex
she
bent
over
hugh
parted
with
her
soft
white
hand
his
rich
glossy
hair
from
his
forehead
and
pressed
it
with
her
ruby
lips
hugh
rise
she
said
fondly
and
earnestly
entreat
you
pray
be
more
calm
elevate
yourself
above
this
morbid
feeling
of
unhappiness
and
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
communicate
to
me
for
indeed
i
must
almost
instantly
return
to
the
house
i
am
expected
in
the
and
if
missed
a
messenger
will
be
sent
in
search
of
me
i
would
not
for
worlds
be
discovered
he
exclaimed
with
a
quivering
lip
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
once
more
twined
his
arms
about
her
graceful
form
leave
london
i
know
not
yet
at
what
hour
for
southampton
if
that
were
to
be
the
limit
of
my
journey
i
should
not
be
thus
depressed
but
from
a
confidential
source
i
have
received
the
hint
that
i
shall
be
called
upon
to
proceed
by
the
overland
route
to
india
to
the
city
of
agra
i
believe
this
is
decided
our
separation
can
not
therefore
be
less
than
for
six
months
it
may
be
for
years
it
is
this
thought
which
wounds
me
so
deeply
for
what
may
not
happen
in
my
absence
what
indeed
he
paused
for
a
moment
overpowered
by
a
throng
of
painful
anticipations
helen
remained
perfectly
silent
and
clearing
his
voice
he
went
on
can
not
ask
you
not
to
forget
me
he
said
know
that
would
be
impossible
but
but
i
would
ask
you
helen
i
would
ask
you
when
i
am
gone
far
far
hence
to
remember
what
we
have
been
to
each
other
and
to
continue
to
me
as
i
vow
to
heaven
i
will
ever
to
you
remain
true
loving
and
cried
helen
starting
suddenly
footstep
approaches
i
must
fly
farewell
hugh
god
bless
you
and
guard
you
until
we
meet
again
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
he
strained
her
passionately
to
his
breast
and
imprinted
a
thousand
fervid
kisses
on
her
lips
you
will
be
true
to
me
helen
he
whispered
will
hugh
i
will
she
replied
with
an
earnestness
rivalling
his
own
swear
it
dear
do
i
do
one
more
passionate
embrace
many
murmured
but
farewells
a
long
long
kiss
then
she
broke
hastily
from
his
arms
darted
swiftly
into
the
deep
shadows
of
the
trees
flitted
like
a
phantom
over
the
grassy
lawn
and
disappeared
with
a
melancholy
gaze
he
caught
the
last
wave
of
her
white
garments
as
they
vanished
in
the
distance
and
in
the
darkness
and
then
with
a
deep
sigh
he
proceeded
slowly
to
quit
the
spot
ere
he
had
proceeded
a
dozen
yards
a
hand
was
placed
somewhat
vigorously
upon
his
shoulder
he
turned
quickly
the
figure
of
a
man
was
before
him
but
in
the
darkness
he
could
distinguish
nothing
further
a
voice
he
did
not
recognise
said
roughly
to
him
why
are
you
lurking
here
hugh
flung
him
fiercely
hack
are
you
who
dare
thus
address
me
he
cried
angrily
you
shall
know
somewhat
too
soon
for
your
satisfaction
returned
his
questioner
again
seizing
him
and
with
great
strength
dragging
him
from
the
thicket
towards
the
gravel
path
lady
too
he
added
hardly
escape
detection
i
have
marked
her
more
he
was
unable
to
say
for
the
impetuous
bands
of
hugh
clutched
his
throat
and
prevented
further
utterance
a
desperate
struggle
ensued
it
was
so
far
but
a
wrestle
hugh
sought
to
release
himself
from
the
grip
of
him
who
had
seized
him
and
his
captor
did
his
utmost
to
retain
his
hold
in
the
course
of
the
contention
they
emerged
from
the
thicket
into
the
moonlight
which
fell
upon
the
faces
of
both
each
was
thus
able
to
distinguish
clearly
the
features
of
his
antagonist
but
both
were
utter
strangers
to
each
other
simultaneously
they
detected
they
had
not
met
before
hugh
riversdale
knew
not
that
he
was
striving
with
lester
vane
but
he
was
sure
that
he
should
never
forget
the
face
the
pallid
face
within
a
foot
of
his
own
which
the
gray
moonlight
was
tinting
with
the
hue
of
death
nor
did
lester
vane
fear
he
should
fail
to
remember
the
features
of
one
whom
he
instantly
perceived
was
strikingly
handsome
and
no
common
personage
he
found
his
strength
failing
him
that
hugh
would
succeed
in
releasing
himself
from
his
custody
and
he
shouted
loudly
for
help
the
next
instant
he
received
a
tremendous
blow
upon
the
temple
and
was
hurled
to
the
ground
with
such
force
as
to
compel
him
to
remain
there
stunned
and
insensible
hugh
cast
a
glance
upon
him
as
he
lay
motionless
upon
the
gravel
path
have
seen
that
face
in
a
he
muttered
enemy
from
henceforward
we
have
for
the
first
time
crossed
each
path
we
shall
again
woe
to
him
who
stumbles
on
it
the
sounds
of
persons
running
along
the
garden
walk
caught
his
ear
at
this
moment
servants
roused
by
the
shouts
of
lester
vane
were
hastening
to
his
assistance
hugh
plunged
into
the
thicket
vaulted
over
the
iron
fencing
upon
the
edge
of
the
ornamental
waters
plunged
into
the
winding
canal
and
swimming
briskly
but
noiselessly
beneath
the
shadows
of
some
weeping
willows
continued
his
progress
until
he
reached
a
bend
of
the
stream
not
visible
from
garden
and
then
emerging
from
the
water
he
disappeared
among
the
thick
cluster
of
trees
which
there
lined
its
banks
in
the
meanwhile
the
form
of
lester
vane
lying
insensible
was
discovered
by
two
or
three
male
servants
under
the
direction
of
whelks
during
the
race
from
the
house
he
was
absolutely
last
in
it
but
on
finding
that
there
was
no
enemy
to
encounter
he
exhibited
the
most
reckless
display
of
daring
and
rushed
to
the
front
directly
his
pale
green
eyes
fell
upon
the
prostrate
form
of
guest
he
exclaimed
my
if
it
the
lester
wane
grashus
is
it
the
wine
overcom
i
wonder
said
one
of
the
servants
got
a
hugly
bump
on
his
forrid
a
precious
whack
that
somebody
about
here
must
given
it
owdashus
thief
no
doubt
suggested
whelks
with
a
swift
glance
over
his
left
shoulder
at
the
clump
of
trees
and
a
shudder
which
lifted
his
scalp
and
pained
him
in
the
heels
he
added
quickly
to
the
man
who
had
just
spoken
me
to
carry
lester
corpse
if
he
is
a
corpse
into
the
and
you
cussinks
he
continued
addressing
the
other
servant
dash
into
that
clump
trees
and
about
for
the
whelks
and
jackson
hurried
on
with
their
burden
and
declining
the
verb
to
search
proposed
by
whelks
sallied
out
for
that
gallant
official
the
policeman
who
is
supposed
to
know
no
fear
and
to
be
ever
ready
to
seize
the
most
ferocious
ruffian
in
existence
with
the
same
promptness
with
which
he
would
attack
cold
mutton
down
a
deep
area
by
the
time
the
house
was
gained
by
this
little
party
grahame
had
been
alarmed
with
his
son
malcolm
and
the
duke
of
allborne
he
was
hastening
to
the
garden
when
he
encountered
whelks
and
jackson
bearing
the
body
of
lester
vane
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
injured
young
man
aroused
from
the
stupor
into
which
the
blow
he
had
received
had
flung
him
recovered
his
feet
and
gazed
round
him
with
an
astonished
air
he
looked
into
the
many
eager
faces
bent
upon
his
own
without
recognising
any
of
them
the
duke
of
allborne
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
shook
him
saying
at
the
same
moment
wecovaw
youawself
my
good
fellah
we
aw
all
fwiends
allborne
you
me
the
sound
of
his
voice
brought
back
the
absent
recollection
of
lester
vane
he
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
as
though
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
then
he
exclaimed
hastily
remember
all
now
all
distinctly
he
looked
up
and
addressing
grahame
he
said
dear
sir
if
you
will
allow
me
to
retire
for
a
few
minutes
to
collect
myself
i
will
join
you
with
the
ladies
in
the
where
i
will
relate
to
you
the
strange
incident
in
which
i
have
i
believe
borne
the
worst
vane
responded
grahame
quickly
attack
you
have
made
by
no
common
individual
grahame
one
who
is
by
this
time
i
have
no
doubt
far
beyond
the
object
vane
observed
grahame
with
an
air
of
mystified
wonder
plunder
nor
violence
returned
lester
vane
adding
hastily
interrogate
me
no
further
now
a
few
minutes
hence
and
i
will
relate
all
that
occurred
i
beg
now
to
be
allowed
to
retire
to
my
grahame
bowed
and
directed
whelks
to
show
vane
to
his
chamber
while
he
with
the
duke
and
malcolm
his
son
took
their
way
to
the
talking
over
the
mysterious
event
the
ladies
had
entered
the
room
a
moment
before
them
and
they
now
heard
from
the
gentlemen
with
astonishment
that
the
honorable
lester
vane
walking
in
the
garden
had
been
suddenly
attacked
and
felled
to
the
earth
by
some
unknown
assailant
not
the
least
astounded
of
the
party
present
was
helen
grahame
the
blood
rushed
from
her
heart
to
her
brain
she
felt
as
though
a
thousand
bells
were
ringing
in
her
ears
then
the
swept
back
to
her
heart
leaving
her
as
cold
as
death
and
as
colourless
hugh
riversdale
and
lester
vane
had
encountered
each
other
what
had
passed
her
first
impulse
was
to
dart
out
of
the
room
the
house
and
flee
anywhere
anywhere
the
next
to
remain
where
she
was
face
all
that
might
be
brought
forward
to
crush
her
for
ever
and
to
deny
every
charge
firmly
steadfastly
even
to
deny
hugh
riversdale
if
in
custody
he
were
brought
forward
to
confront
her
oh
that
she
could
only
know
what
had
actually
occurred
so
that
she
might
be
prepared
to
enact
the
part
it
would
be
best
for
her
to
play
why
did
lester
vane
refuse
to
explain
what
had
happened
when
he
first
recovered
in
presence
why
did
he
defer
it
until
all
were
assembled
in
the
did
he
know
that
she
had
had
an
interview
with
hugh
riversdale
this
was
remarkable
and
much
disturbed
her
yet
if
he
did
know
that
she
had
a
clandestine
meeting
with
his
assailant
he
could
surely
entertain
no
feeling
of
animosity
towards
her
that
seemed
impossible
the
acquaintance
of
an
hour
could
hardly
have
raised
up
in
his
breast
a
wish
to
injure
her
yet
why
did
he
pursue
the
strange
course
of
refusing
to
relate
what
had
passed
unless
he
knew
she
would
be
present
to
hear
the
recital
her
anxious
surmises
were
the
suspicions
that
haunted
a
guilty
mind
for
she
had
no
just
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
connect
her
with
the
mystery
at
all
she
was
perplexed
disconcerted
plunged
into
an
agony
of
mind
as
she
pursued
this
train
of
reasoning
still
she
saw
the
imperious
necessity
of
appearing
calm
collected
and
full
of
wonder
only
to
the
extent
she
would
have
been
had
she
had
no
further
share
in
the
event
than
her
sister
margaret
by
an
effort
of
her
will
she
knew
she
could
achieve
this
much
and
she
resolved
to
do
it
as
she
formed
the
resolution
the
door
opened
and
lester
vane
entered
he
was
pale
there
was
a
slight
wound
on
his
forehead
strapped
up
but
otherwise
he
was
as
and
had
the
same
cold
smile
playing
upon
his
lips
as
when
first
he
entered
the
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
a
thrill
of
pain
ran
through
the
frame
of
helen
as
she
felt
his
large
dark
eye
settle
upon
her
then
a
sudden
sense
of
her
danger
roused
her
to
exertion
and
she
forced
down
all
outward
sign
of
the
conflict
going
on
within
her
breast
she
turned
her
glittering
eyes
slowly
but
full
upon
lester
met
him
on
his
own
and
drove
him
back
for
her
gaze
was
so
firm
and
unwavering
that
he
turned
his
eyes
after
a
searching
glance
at
her
upon
the
ground
all
crowded
round
him
save
evangeline
who
as
usual
sat
quietly
and
unobtrusively
in
a
retired
part
of
the
room
if
there
was
in
that
brilliantly
lighted
apartment
such
a
spot
helen
was
among
the
first
of
those
who
called
upon
lester
vane
to
explain
the
remarkable
affair
which
had
had
so
unpleasant
a
termination
for
him
her
inquiries
were
dictated
by
the
most
intense
desire
to
ascertain
if
her
suspicions
were
correct
but
her
acting
was
a
masterpiece
it
had
the
air
of
a
very
natural
curiosity
only
the
ordeal
however
was
yet
to
come
by
general
request
eagerly
urged
lester
vane
commenced
his
recital
helen
perceived
that
he
closely
and
scrutinisingly
perused
her
features
while
he
spoke
and
a
strange
feeling
took
sudden
possession
of
her
it
was
a
contemptuous
consciousness
of
a
superiority
in
the
power
of
deception
she
knew
that
he
was
trying
to
read
what
was
passing
within
her
heart
she
applied
herself
to
the
task
of
baffling
him
feeling
that
she
could
accomplish
it
with
ease
it
was
her
first
direct
essay
in
simulation
under
strong
pressure
but
she
went
to
the
task
with
the
skill
of
a
practised
adept
cunning
is
not
alone
an
art
it
is
necessarily
a
part
of
human
organisation
but
to
become
subtle
and
refined
it
requires
to
be
cultivated
with
careful
discrimination
and
to
be
pursued
with
merciless
indifference
to
the
feelings
of
the
object
upon
whom
it
is
exercised
the
crafty
rarely
fails
to
detect
the
crafty
unless
the
more
crafty
with
consummate
ability
assumes
genuine
simplicity
then
as
there
appears
to
be
nothing
to
guard
against
cunning
is
to
be
effectively
deceived
by
an
affectation
of
its
absence
helen
never
troubled
herself
to
reason
upon
the
point
though
she
had
plenty
of
natural
shrewdness
to
have
reached
this
conclusion
if
she
had
addressed
her
mind
to
the
task
she
was
naturally
an
accomplished
actress
and
with
no
great
effort
could
have
seemed
as
full
of
natural
wonderment
at
what
had
happened
as
her
sisters
margaret
and
evangeline
but
she
decided
upon
adopting
a
defiant
aspect
one
which
should
say
to
vane
seek
by
an
attempt
to
confuse
me
with
your
steadfast
gaze
to
compel
me
to
make
an
admission
i
defy
it
was
a
mistake
because
that
look
at
once
raised
up
an
impression
in
his
mind
that
she
had
something
to
conceal
that
though
she
listened
to
his
story
attentively
met
his
gaze
at
certain
parts
of
the
recital
unflinchingly
made
remarks
and
put
questions
all
tending
to
disconnect
her
with
any
share
in
the
transaction
she
was
in
some
degree
mixed
up
with
if
she
was
not
one
of
the
principal
actors
in
the
little
drama
it
is
true
that
evangeline
exhibited
emotions
of
distress
and
confusion
but
he
detected
in
her
conduct
no
sign
of
guilt
nothing
by
which
he
could
presume
her
to
have
been
a
participator
in
the
scene
he
believed
himself
to
have
disturbed
if
even
she
were
a
confidante
but
helen
by
her
manner
challenged
his
suspicions
and
as
it
appeared
to
him
laughed
them
to
scorn
yet
in
doing
so
gave
him
reason
to
form
a
conviction
that
they
were
well
grounded
he
set
his
teeth
and
felt
the
blood
mount
to
his
sallow
features
it
was
but
for
a
moment
and
he
became
as
pale
as
before
but
he
determined
to
apply
himself
to
the
task
of
making
himself
master
of
secret
and
by
its
possession
master
of
her
to
be
used
as
his
own
selfish
interests
might
dictate
he
related
to
his
marvelling
auditors
how
he
had
escaped
from
the
dining
room
to
allay
the
heat
of
his
fevered
blood
in
the
cool
air
which
had
been
playing
among
the
fragrant
and
sighing
through
the
graceful
trees
in
the
elegantly
arranged
garden
for
the
sake
of
effect
the
speaker
adopted
a
poetical
style
of
narration
not
without
success
upon
the
majority
of
his
listeners
the
lip
of
helen
curled
to
her
the
chosen
language
was
another
proof
of
this
art
and
she
scarcely
attempted
to
disguise
from
him
that
such
was
her
impression
a
sense
of
her
estimate
of
his
display
added
only
to
the
intensity
of
his
resolve
to
obtain
entire
power
over
her
that
he
might
make
her
endure
tenfold
the
annoyance
it
was
something
more
which
she
made
him
suffer
now
he
could
not
quite
comprehend
why
they
so
suddenly
stood
in
an
antagonistic
position
to
each
other
it
was
enough
for
him
that
they
did
so
and
that
he
believed
that
he
should
be
able
to
avenge
himself
upon
one
who
viewed
him
in
a
light
insulting
to
his
vanity
proceeding
with
his
tale
he
said
that
as
he
slowly
paced
the
gravelled
walk
in
the
broad
moonlight
he
fancied
that
he
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
in
a
retired
part
of
the
garden
low
and
subdued
in
truth
but
still
he
was
struck
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
sound
which
was
that
of
two
persons
in
secret
conference
he
gained
the
spot
from
whence
it
appeared
to
come
and
found
himself
fronting
a
small
cluster
of
trees
into
which
he
directed
his
gaze
but
not
observing
any
figure
or
sign
of
a
human
being
he
assured
himself
that
he
had
been
deceived
that
he
had
mistaken
the
soft
bubbling
of
the
flowing
waters
beyond
for
tones
of
the
human
voice
he
continued
his
walk
but
he
had
not
proceeded
far
ere
the
sounds
which
had
previously
attracted
his
attention
were
renewed
the
position
he
had
gained
enabled
him
to
command
a
view
of
the
thicket
he
fixed
his
deep
dark
eyes
upon
helen
as
he
arrived
at
this
part
of
his
narrative
but
her
eyelid
never
wavered
nor
did
her
face
undergo
any
change
he
felt
himself
baffled
for
a
moment
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
retraced
his
footsteps
and
when
near
the
clump
of
trees
paused
with
the
intent
of
catching
if
possible
some
of
the
words
which
passed
between
the
two
persons
who
were
engaged
in
such
deep
and
earnest
conversation
not
he
added
hastily
as
he
saw
the
eye
of
helen
glitter
with
scorn
to
play
the
part
of
a
paltry
but
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
unconsciously
encountered
a
couple
of
enamoured
servants
deep
in
a
with
what
withering
emphasis
he
used
those
words
or
had
detected
a
brace
of
thieves
in
the
act
of
concerting
measures
to
rob
the
house
of
grahame
while
standing
irresolute
as
to
the
steps
he
should
take
a
female
emerged
from
the
thicket
and
fled
past
him
towards
the
house
my
house
cried
grahame
elevating
his
eyebrows
with
astonishment
so
cried
lester
vane
she
did
not
enter
it
he
cried
his
eyes
sparkling
with
fury
shameless
person
world
impression
is
said
lester
observing
how
intently
and
with
what
remarkable
helen
regarded
him
she
disappeared
in
the
shrubbery
in
front
of
the
house
i
can
not
be
positive
for
the
next
moment
i
was
in
contact
with
her
still
face
was
rigid
her
features
composed
and
her
eye
steadily
fixed
upon
his
but
there
was
no
expression
of
wonder
upon
her
countenance
as
upon
that
of
all
the
rest
what
more
needed
lester
to
tell
him
that
it
was
she
whom
he
had
seen
flitting
from
the
grove
of
trees
across
the
garden
to
the
house
and
that
she
held
secret
meetings
with
some
person
unknown
to
her
family
this
wretch
this
insolent
scoundrel
cried
grahame
fastened
upon
him
i
presume
and
thus
was
most
murderously
assaulted
said
lester
vane
speaking
slowly
and
with
distinctness
moonlight
fell
upon
his
face
that
i
saw
clearly
and
well
would
know
it
again
exclaimed
grahame
with
eagerness
a
million
faces
he
answered
between
his
teeth
and
then
added
was
a
person
and
i
should
have
let
him
pass
but
he
made
a
desperate
blow
at
me
although
he
did
not
utter
a
word
i
avoided
his
first
attack
and
collared
him
determined
to
punish
him
for
his
cowardly
and
dastardly
conduct
i
called
for
assistance
as
i
had
no
intention
of
entering
into
a
personal
conflict
with
a
low
ruffian
about
whom
i
knew
nothing
but
he
inflicted
upon
my
forehead
a
blow
with
some
weapon
which
rendered
me
insensible
and
so
ends
my
monstrous
exclaimed
grahame
with
an
air
of
indignant
pride
never
heard
of
such
an
outrage
you
can
describe
the
man
vane
so
that
the
police
may
be
able
to
track
him
and
take
him
into
custody
accurately
replied
lester
not
my
head
aches
and
the
task
would
be
an
annoyance
with
pleasure
but
excuse
the
creature
with
this
desperate
person
could
you
not
my
dear
vane
describe
her
if
it
were
only
her
attire
urged
grahame
may
be
in
the
house
interposed
grahame
feeling
that
a
deadly
outrage
had
been
committed
upon
the
family
pride
may
be
in
the
house
returned
lester
with
a
peculiar
glance
directed
to
helen
i
can
inform
you
in
reply
to
your
question
is
that
her
dress
was
of
some
light
fabric
but
as
she
fled
past
me
like
a
phantom
i
was
not
able
to
observe
her
sufficiently
well
to
give
a
description
of
the
lady
indeed
exclaimed
grahame
in
a
tone
of
immeasurable
contempt
grahame
this
strange
affair
must
be
thoroughly
grahame
it
shall
be
he
replied
widiculously
womantic
miss
gwahame
laughed
the
duke
of
allborne
addressing
helen
helen
started
as
he
spoke
she
had
listened
to
the
sneering
sarcasms
of
lester
and
to
her
expressions
of
withering
contempt
as
though
she
had
been
exposed
to
an
atmosphere
of
flame
and
was
bound
to
endure
its
tremendous
torture
without
one
sob
of
pain
but
great
as
was
her
agony
her
thoughts
would
fly
away
with
her
to
him
who
had
occasioned
this
scene
she
was
therefore
thankful
to
the
duke
for
thus
checking
an
absence
of
mind
which
might
have
excited
attention
and
caused
remark
she
replied
to
him
with
a
vivacity
which
somewhat
astonished
lester
vane
though
it
helped
to
confirm
the
suspicions
he
entertained
connecting
her
with
the
interview
in
the
thicket
she
adroitly
contrived
to
place
the
affair
in
a
ridiculous
light
without
openly
giving
cause
of
offence
to
him
because
with
affected
sympathy
she
deplored
the
injury
he
had
received
but
she
went
so
far
as
to
cause
him
to
observe
with
a
sickly
smile
miss
grahame
conceive
that
the
affair
after
all
was
a
mere
fancy
occasioned
by
the
fatigues
of
my
journey
the
stwength
of
our
fwiend
fine
old
pawt
exclaimed
the
duke
with
a
loud
laugh
grahame
instantly
took
helen
to
task
in
so
serious
and
so
stately
a
manner
that
lester
vane
interfered
to
obtain
pardon
for
her
which
was
granted
at
his
instance
in
a
manner
that
mortified
her
only
more
bitterly
than
she
had
yet
been
will
bring
him
a
suppliant
to
my
feet
she
said
mentally
as
her
eyes
sparkling
like
a
star
fastened
upon
him
when
he
is
prostrate
abject
crush
him
the
next
evening
helen
and
lester
were
walking
in
the
garden
together
she
had
already
begun
to
weave
her
web
round
him
and
he
seemed
likely
to
become
so
enmeshed
as
never
more
to
escape
from
it
suddenly
when
near
the
ornamental
water
he
paused
he
drew
from
his
breast
a
small
but
exquisitely
fine
cambric
handkerchief
beg
your
pardon
miss
grahame
he
said
i
betray
any
impertinent
curiosity
but
i
am
desirous
of
knowing
whether
you
are
acquainted
with
this
handkerchief
she
looked
at
it
in
a
corner
embroidered
were
the
initials
it
was
her
own
and
one
of
value
she
smiled
she
answered
ought
to
know
it
well
found
it
beneath
a
tree
there
he
added
pointing
to
the
thicket
in
which
she
had
parted
with
hugh
riversdale
she
had
no
doubt
dropped
it
on
leaving
hugh
the
night
before
she
felt
an
acute
pain
run
through
her
brain
as
she
saw
in
what
direction
his
finger
pointed
and
that
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
were
absolutely
glaring
upon
her
she
detected
in
an
instant
how
much
depended
upon
her
answer
controlling
as
before
with
a
remarkable
exertion
of
the
expression
of
her
features
she
assumed
an
air
of
indifference
and
flinging
the
handkerchief
into
the
stream
upon
the
brink
of
which
she
was
standing
she
answered
it
is
one
i
some
time
since
gave
to
my
maid
lester
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
in
reply
he
was
baffled
he
watched
the
handkerchief
float
away
and
he
said
to
himself
it
was
you
who
stood
last
night
in
the
thicket
along
with
the
fellow
who
felled
me
to
the
earth
despite
this
check
i
will
proye
it
and
to
chapter
the
inexplicable
liberation
alas
mad
this
is
the
very
coinage
of
your
brain
this
bodiless
creation
ecstasy
is
very
cunning
in
shakspere
the
emotion
displayed
by
old
wilton
when
colonel
mires
made
himself
known
to
him
by
reference
to
an
incident
which
had
occurred
to
him
at
a
period
now
long
past
was
a
mystery
to
the
two
persons
likely
to
be
best
acquainted
with
its
source
flora
who
flew
to
her
aid
marvelled
at
it
and
the
indian
colonel
wondered
no
less
flora
knew
nothing
however
of
the
event
alluded
to
as
her
father
had
not
suffered
mention
of
it
to
escape
his
lips
but
colonel
mires
from
whom
some
emotion
might
perhaps
have
been
expected
while
recurring
to
it
having
been
a
principal
actor
in
a
circumstance
of
a
remarkable
nature
could
find
in
a
rapid
review
of
what
had
then
occurred
no
cause
for
wilton
to
be
thus
suddenly
affected
wilton
had
been
called
upon
to
render
a
great
a
valuable
and
disinterested
service
he
had
performed
it
nobly
because
it
then
seemed
he
was
in
nowise
personally
interested
or
affected
by
the
result
why
therefore
he
should
now
appear
overcome
by
his
feelings
somewhat
staggered
the
colonel
and
set
him
cogitating
perhaps
after
all
there
had
been
a
motive
in
his
generosity
and
if
so
it
certainly
behoved
him
to
find
it
out
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
flora
was
surprised
but
that
emotion
gave
way
to
one
of
affright
when
she
beheld
her
pale
and
haggard
face
his
closed
eyes
and
his
lips
apart
it
looked
like
the
approach
of
death
she
knew
what
a
shock
the
arrival
of
jukes
had
given
him
shattered
as
his
frame
had
been
by
affliction
it
had
been
yet
more
deeply
shaken
by
the
mortal
agony
he
had
endured
when
he
first
learned
the
destruction
of
the
residence
he
had
quitted
by
fire
when
his
darling
child
barely
escaped
with
life
events
calculated
to
act
upon
his
nervous
system
had
rapidly
followed
each
other
and
the
last
by
its
sudden
effect
upon
him
seemed
in
no
degree
the
least
severe
as
she
hung
over
him
mournful
and
foreboding
words
fell
from
her
lips
she
turned
her
eyes
appealingly
for
aid
to
hal
for
of
those
present
he
was
the
only
one
to
whom
she
could
address
herself
in
reliance
upon
the
sincerity
of
his
readiness
to
assist
her
colonel
mires
observed
her
glance
and
at
whom
it
was
directed
before
hal
nimble
though
he
was
in
responding
to
her
mute
summons
could
reach
her
colonel
mires
placed
himself
at
the
side
of
her
father
laid
his
fingers
upon
his
wrist
and
said
in
a
low
but
musical
tone
of
voice
not
alarmed
miss
wilton
a
sudden
faintness
only
has
seized
your
father
when
last
we
met
his
position
was
very
far
above
this
and
on
meeting
with
me
no
doubt
the
fearful
reverse
he
has
experienced
has
acted
upon
his
weak
frame
pray
cease
to
fear
i
believe
that
i
can
speedily
restore
him
and
when
he
is
a
little
collected
and
composed
we
will
design
measures
to
remove
him
from
this
of
the
flora
turned
her
eyes
with
a
grateful
expression
upon
him
but
became
instantly
embarrassed
by
his
steadfast
gaze
while
a
creeping
sensation
of
fear
and
dislike
passed
over
her
head
she
glanced
at
hal
and
was
rather
startled
to
find
him
regarding
the
colonel
with
a
very
fierce
expression
why
she
did
not
understand
she
had
yet
to
learn
that
a
lover
rarely
betrays
satisfaction
when
he
perceives
the
gaze
of
one
of
his
own
sex
dwelling
with
marked
admiration
upon
the
fair
features
of
the
maid
he
loves
perhaps
the
colonel
observed
the
fiery
look
of
the
young
goldsmith
if
he
did
he
outwardly
took
no
notice
of
it
but
taking
from
his
breast
pocket
a
small
case
which
contained
a
phial
he
poured
a
few
drops
into
some
water
and
administered
it
to
old
wilton
who
had
no
sooner
taken
it
than
he
revived
and
became
speedily
conscious
of
the
presence
of
his
visitors
as
the
dark
features
of
the
colonel
attracted
his
attention
he
clutched
his
hand
and
in
a
hoarse
whisper
said
it
safe
is
it
safe
what
safe
dear
father
she
asked
paper
the
paper
i
gave
into
your
care
he
replied
wildly
yes
she
responded
quickly
gave
it
back
to
you
scarce
half
an
hour
ago
do
you
not
remember
he
placed
his
hand
to
his
brow
and
then
pressed
his
fingers
over
his
eyes
as
if
to
recal
what
had
recently
passed
the
influence
of
the
restorative
administered
to
him
by
the
colonel
was
quickly
apparent
he
withdrew
his
hand
and
gazed
about
him
but
only
for
a
moment
he
rose
up
his
eye
was
bright
his
carriage
firm
and
his
head
erect
his
bearing
gave
him
the
aspect
of
another
man
mires
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
exultation
arrival
in
england
at
this
juncture
is
most
opportune
your
discovery
of
me
in
this
prison
an
interposition
of
providence
its
consequences
to
me
are
of
vital
importance
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
joy
the
happiness
it
has
brought
to
a
man
bowed
down
by
a
succession
of
dire
wilton
i
am
unprepared
to
hear
such
expressions
from
your
lips
believe
me
it
affords
me
especial
gratification
rejoined
colonel
mires
casting
his
eyes
craftily
upon
flora
to
observe
what
effect
her
words
in
his
praise
would
have
upon
her
but
she
saw
not
his
glance
for
she
was
watching
anxiously
the
features
of
hal
vivian
who
was
listening
to
her
father
with
a
countenance
which
appeared
to
assume
a
deeper
gravity
at
every
succeeding
sentence
and
she
wondered
that
he
should
grow
so
serious
and
seem
so
sad
because
her
father
spoke
in
tones
of
joyfulness
had
she
known
that
he
considered
her
favour
a
passport
to
her
own
she
might
not
have
marvelled
at
his
sober
countenance
at
all
old
wilton
proceeded
addressing
the
colonel
hackneyed
aphorism
which
tells
us
that
darkest
hour
is
the
hour
before
the
dawn
is
true
in
my
case
colonel
mires
my
dark
hour
has
spent
the
whole
force
of
its
pestilential
blackness
upon
me
i
have
been
utterly
shrouded
in
its
gloom
your
coming
is
as
the
dawn
which
will
herald
my
day
of
sunshine
how
wondrous
are
the
workings
of
providence
but
now
i
was
lo
in
an
instant
i
bound
into
new
life
and
yet
in
the
same
old
old
world
oh
colonel
mires
my
heart
is
too
full
for
utterance
i
will
take
another
and
a
better
opportunity
to
express
not
alone
what
i
feel
but
to
explain
to
you
wherefore
your
arrival
has
filled
me
with
delight
and
why
it
will
prove
to
me
a
benefit
so
my
honour
wilton
by
so
doing
you
will
confer
a
great
favour
upon
me
returned
colonel
mires
at
present
i
do
assure
you
your
expression
of
high
satisfaction
and
your
excited
manner
form
together
a
problem
which
i
feel
quite
incapable
of
working
to
a
successful
should
be
more
than
surprised
if
such
were
not
the
case
returned
old
wilton
quickly
could
you
understand
my
gladness
at
beholding
you
when
the
only
conclusion
you
could
form
from
the
past
would
be
that
i
should
meet
you
with
combined
feelings
of
regret
and
reproach
it
is
not
possible
for
you
to
conjecture
how
your
advent
should
be
productive
of
happiness
to
me
and
my
coming
to
england
even
though
i
know
not
how
should
be
the
occasion
of
so
agreeable
a
change
in
the
lot
of
miss
wilton
i
shall
only
be
too
delighted
at
my
good
fortune
without
caring
to
inquire
by
what
happy
combination
of
circumstances
it
has
been
effected
exclaimed
colonel
mires
with
another
very
steadfast
earnest
glance
at
flora
which
embarrassed
her
and
did
not
have
the
desired
effect
of
making
her
think
favourably
of
him
colonel
mires
exclaimed
wilton
drily
i
have
no
doubt
raise
up
such
a
feeling
in
your
the
colonel
winced
but
bowed
affirmatively
wilton
then
added
hastily
mires
your
discovery
of
my
detention
in
this
prison
is
of
course
entirely
the
result
of
accident
you
did
not
come
here
to
see
me
of
that
i
am
moment
i
had
a
old
wilton
waved
his
hand
am
quite
able
to
comprehend
the
reason
of
your
presence
colonel
he
said
i
am
not
to
sustain
a
longer
interview
to
day
you
will
do
me
a
favour
by
excusing
me
now
but
if
you
will
oblige
me
with
your
address
i
will
call
upon
you
there
at
any
appointment
you
may
make
and
take
an
occasion
to
explain
to
you
much
of
the
present
harry
vivian
had
previously
entertained
some
doubts
about
the
saneness
of
old
wilton
the
strange
rebound
from
abject
wretchedness
to
a
species
of
delirious
joy
startled
him
could
see
nothing
in
the
exterior
of
the
swarthy
colonel
from
india
to
raise
up
such
a
paroxysm
of
gratification
as
that
displayed
by
the
careworn
old
man
unless
he
expected
him
to
pay
off
the
detainers
at
the
prison
gate
and
thus
set
him
free
but
when
old
wilton
requested
of
colonel
mires
his
address
and
offered
to
call
upon
him
at
time
he
might
appoint
then
doubts
were
dissipated
what
with
two
thousand
pounds
turned
into
locks
bolts
bars
and
iron
gates
to
arrest
his
movements
to
talk
of
keeping
appointments
outside
the
why
it
was
the
very
phantasy
of
lunacy
he
believed
him
to
be
without
a
farthing
in
the
world
and
had
provided
himself
with
a
little
sum
with
which
to
carry
the
old
man
on
if
he
would
accept
it
and
there
was
previously
every
probability
that
he
would
but
now
to
hear
his
tone
and
to
note
his
manner
as
well
as
to
listen
to
his
airy
offer
to
appear
anywhere
at
any
time
he
felt
disposed
to
button
his
pocket
and
to
laugh
he
did
not
do
either
he
whistled
it
was
a
soft
low
sound
unconsciously
emitted
not
altogether
well
bred
we
must
admit
but
it
was
the
very
symbol
of
extreme
surprise
old
wilton
heard
him
glanced
at
him
turned
his
eyes
away
and
a
faint
smile
curled
his
upper
lip
flora
heard
the
whistle
too
she
looked
at
hal
and
then
at
her
father
she
had
her
misgivings
likewise
she
believed
every
shilling
he
had
possessed
to
be
gone
and
to
hear
him
speak
thus
made
her
heart
throb
violently
oh
if
grief
and
trial
should
have
turned
his
brain
her
father
understood
her
gaze
he
read
her
thoughts
and
his
smile
deepened
colonel
mires
heard
the
unconscious
whistle
also
he
darted
a
look
at
hal
and
then
turned
to
wilton
and
peering
at
him
under
his
eyebrows
in
a
scrutinising
manner
he
said
in
a
tone
which
had
more
than
a
tinge
of
irony
in
it
you
say
wilton
course
thought
hal
just
it
he
might
as
well
say
hence
one
is
as
likely
as
the
to
his
surprise
not
less
than
to
that
of
colonel
mires
wilton
answered
if
you
please
at
what
hour
moonshine
thought
hal
old
man
how
mad
he
is
getting
in
the
morning
returned
the
colonel
with
a
grim
smile
ten
echoed
wilton
have
not
named
the
place
he
added
must
be
here
if
there
is
to
be
a
meeting
anywhere
thought
hal
colonel
mires
produced
a
and
handed
a
card
to
wilton
who
held
it
close
to
his
eyes
far
he
muttered
and
then
exclaimed
aloud
will
be
there
colonel
punctually
and
without
will
not
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
i
hope
said
colonel
mires
with
a
mystified
air
no
oh
no
returned
old
wilton
with
a
smile
be
sure
not
reflected
hal
should
it
there
is
only
two
thousand
pounds
to
prevent
him
leaving
the
prison
and
what
is
that
to
a
man
who
has
not
two
crowns
to
jingle
together
colonel
mires
gave
a
dry
cough
was
not
aware
he
said
it
was
an
easy
thing
to
effect
a
liberation
from
this
place
i
have
an
old
friend
in
durance
here
whom
i
came
to
see
he
has
been
here
a
length
of
time
and
is
in
tribulation
at
the
remote
possibility
of
his
thing
is
not
difficult
when
you
know
the
way
i
have
a
way
returned
wilton
rather
curtly
two
thousand
pounds
too
of
course
mentally
suggested
hal
considering
it
hard
to
understand
why
under
such
circumstances
wilton
should
have
suffered
himself
to
be
imprisoned
at
all
shall
keep
my
appointment
colonel
mires
never
fear
said
wilton
decidedly
though
coldly
leave
here
possibly
suggested
the
colonel
shall
accompany
my
daughter
hence
responded
wilton
hal
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
this
last
remark
by
wilton
seemed
to
him
quite
to
settle
the
point
of
his
sanity
old
gentleman
his
brain
is
completely
turned
poor
flora
fresh
troubles
instead
of
coming
happiness
for
you
he
thought
i
will
try
everything
to
make
your
heavy
burden
of
care
sit
as
lightly
upon
your
shoulders
as
let
me
repeat
colonel
remarked
old
wilton
with
emphasis
shall
be
glad
if
by
taking
your
leave
you
will
close
this
interview
i
am
fatigued
overcome
by
the
exciting
events
of
the
past
few
days
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
my
daughter
and
vivian
as
noble
and
gallant
a
gentleman
as
england
ever
ejaculated
the
colonel
in
a
tone
of
insulting
surprise
nevertheless
continued
wilton
and
raising
his
voice
said
a
bayard
peur
et
sans
would
have
hesitated
ere
he
attempted
to
perform
the
brave
deed
this
gallant
youth
has
lately
achieved
you
will
know
more
of
him
it
was
strange
how
steadfastly
the
two
men
looked
into
each
eyes
as
wilton
uttered
these
words
colonel
mires
was
a
soldier
a
martinet
he
had
been
able
to
look
down
his
inferior
officers
and
his
men
by
the
hard
fixedness
of
his
gaze
but
he
could
not
compel
hal
to
wink
an
eyelash
the
clear
bright
eye
of
the
youth
was
not
to
be
made
to
waver
and
the
colonel
found
himself
obliged
to
be
the
first
to
remove
his
gaze
he
thought
can
never
be
the
suitor
for
the
hand
of
daughter
if
he
is
he
shall
never
have
her
by
heaven
so
lovely
a
creature
shall
never
be
thrown
away
upon
such
a
churl
as
he
a
pearl
for
such
a
pig
bah
he
was
however
with
much
discomfort
forced
to
leave
the
pearl
with
the
pig
and
obliged
to
see
that
while
flora
would
not
permit
her
eyes
to
meet
his
she
frequently
suffered
them
radiant
with
lustrous
beauty
to
settle
upon
face
lingering
there
as
though
loth
to
leave
what
they
loved
to
dwell
upon
it
was
not
an
agreeable
reflection
considering
the
new
emotions
awakened
in
his
breast
by
the
sight
of
her
face
it
may
have
been
that
dormant
passion
only
was
aroused
he
chose
to
consider
it
a
new
sensation
and
determined
to
satiate
it
at
any
cost
or
hazard
he
was
however
not
a
man
to
suffer
himself
to
appear
to
be
disconcerted
he
was
cool
and
calculating
and
was
not
defeated
until
the
possibility
of
victory
was
wholly
removed
then
he
accepted
the
condition
with
inward
mortification
perhaps
and
a
hope
to
obtain
the
alternative
of
revenge
but
he
did
not
suffer
to
appear
whatured
rage
and
disappointment
he
felt
acutely
but
no
one
ever
saw
him
exhibit
either
he
took
his
leave
of
flora
with
that
gentlemanly
respect
that
betokens
good
breeding
of
hal
with
a
formal
bow
which
said
plainly
though
not
rudely
may
be
a
chevalier
bayard
disguised
as
a
civilian
but
i
am
not
ambitious
of
making
your
he
shook
wilton
heartily
by
the
hand
as
if
he
were
sincere
at
least
in
that
performance
and
expressing
his
gratification
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
him
early
on
the
following
morning
he
took
his
departure
bearing
with
him
his
friend
who
had
been
all
eyes
and
ears
but
of
no
speech
when
wilton
by
gazing
from
the
window
had
satisfied
himself
that
colonel
mires
had
mingled
with
the
throng
below
he
returned
to
the
centre
of
the
room
and
folding
his
daughter
to
his
heart
he
kissed
her
forehead
and
said
to
her
own
sweet
darling
cease
to
regard
me
with
such
anxious
eyes
i
am
not
mad
in
very
truth
my
child
i
am
not
my
sorrows
have
sorely
tried
me
but
heaven
has
been
withal
kind
and
has
spared
me
my
reason
you
do
not
know
the
source
of
my
present
joy
as
you
know
not
the
occasion
of
my
fall
from
a
position
the
pleasures
and
luxuries
of
which
you
were
too
young
to
appreciate
and
which
were
snatched
from
you
ere
you
were
old
enough
to
regret
or
comprehend
yet
dear
father
whenever
i
see
a
handsome
mansion
filled
with
splendid
furniture
magnificent
pictures
beautiful
sculpture
standing
in
the
midst
of
gay
parterres
over
which
wave
graceful
trees
i
seem
to
go
back
to
a
time
when
i
lived
in
such
scenes
i
have
fancied
that
i
have
dreamed
of
these
lovely
places
in
childhood
and
when
i
have
in
later
days
come
to
see
them
i
have
believed
that
my
dreams
only
have
recurred
to
dreams
my
but
a
real
mansion
with
its
luxurious
apartments
its
galleries
of
pictures
sculptures
and
articles
of
rare
and
costly
its
terraced
gardens
its
stately
trees
its
glassy
streams
and
lakes
its
tall
fountains
and
its
gorgeous
woodlands
no
dream
my
for
in
such
a
scene
you
were
born
in
such
a
scene
you
shall
reign
queen
of
beauty
ere
you
are
much
older
my
no
dream
but
he
clutched
her
by
the
wrist
dream
has
been
from
the
hour
when
that
splendour
at
one
remorseless
dreadful
swoop
was
torn
from
my
grasp
up
to
the
moment
of
appearance
here
that
fearful
interval
has
been
the
dark
horrible
terrible
dream
but
my
the
shadows
of
the
night
are
passing
from
us
the
fragrance
of
the
morning
air
is
in
my
nostrils
the
golden
dawn
has
begun
to
light
up
our
too
long
darkened
hemisphere
and
we
shall
yet
revel
in
the
refulgent
beams
of
an
unclouded
he
pressed
her
again
and
again
to
his
bosom
and
kissed
her
with
passionate
fondness
while
large
tears
rolled
down
his
yet
pallid
cheeks
while
yet
caressing
her
and
as
hal
was
preparing
to
ask
him
to
give
him
some
proof
that
what
he
had
just
previously
asserted
was
no
mere
hallucination
a
faint
knock
was
heard
at
the
room
door
before
wilton
could
clear
his
voice
to
give
the
permission
to
enter
the
room
the
door
opened
and
closed
instantly
but
rapid
as
was
the
action
the
door
on
closing
had
left
within
the
room
nathan
gomer
he
nodded
at
wilton
he
nodded
at
hal
and
he
smiled
that
is
grinned
at
flora
all
the
while
his
face
glowed
like
burnished
gold
upon
which
a
sunbeam
rested
wilton
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
he
ran
up
to
him
and
seized
him
by
the
hand
wanted
to
see
you
he
cried
imagined
as
much
here
i
am
responded
nathan
old
wilton
cast
his
eyes
rapidly
upon
flora
upon
hal
and
then
on
nathan
gomer
for
an
instant
he
appeared
perplexed
then
he
said
to
hal
has
not
seen
the
wonders
of
this
place
master
henry
vivian
will
you
conduct
her
where
she
can
see
how
the
prisoners
pass
away
their
long
and
wearisome
days
of
confinement
just
for
a
hal
could
have
told
him
that
she
had
already
witnessed
as
much
as
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
see
but
he
guessed
that
wilton
desired
to
be
alone
with
nathan
gomer
and
he
bowed
assent
have
no
objection
master
vivian
observed
wilton
fancying
that
he
hesitated
echoed
hal
with
an
astounded
look
objection
what
to
have
flora
to
himself
for
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
unquestionably
not
he
emphatically
expressed
himself
to
that
effect
and
so
flora
tied
on
her
sweet
little
bonnet
and
put
on
her
neat
little
mantle
and
laid
the
softest
of
soft
hands
upon
his
arm
making
it
thrill
to
his
heart
near
to
which
it
rested
until
he
hardly
remembered
anything
but
that
she
was
at
his
side
at
once
the
richest
dearest
treasure
upon
earth
confused
by
the
noise
and
by
the
jostling
of
the
throng
of
persons
in
the
racket
ground
they
unconsciously
strolled
round
to
the
back
of
the
prison
or
to
the
county
side
as
it
is
termed
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
three
this
part
was
comparatively
deserted
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
writing
the
needy
prisoners
who
lived
on
the
support
of
their
creditors
and
the
county
were
alone
permitted
to
mix
on
the
parade
in
front
or
to
visit
their
fellow
prisoners
who
were
better
off
than
themselves
during
that
part
of
the
day
no
county
prisoner
for
they
had
their
prison
pride
liked
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
bird
so
he
showed
himself
in
front
as
long
as
he
could
the
back
part
thus
as
we
have
said
had
few
persons
promenading
its
precincts
at
the
hours
named
flora
and
hal
were
in
consequence
comparatively
alone
in
their
walk
as
they
strolled
on
both
seemed
full
of
thought
after
a
silence
which
endured
for
a
short
time
a
few
remarks
were
made
but
of
no
personal
nature
at
length
hal
ventured
to
say
to
her
it
be
possible
my
dear
miss
wilton
that
your
father
is
not
labouring
under
a
delusion
in
speaking
of
his
immediate
liberation
somehow
flora
had
expected
this
question
yet
she
had
not
prepared
an
answer
to
it
she
paused
for
a
moment
then
replied
the
moment
my
dear
father
was
seized
as
a
prisoner
until
now
the
whole
affair
has
been
inexplicable
to
me
i
believe
you
know
even
more
of
his
affairs
than
i
do
what
can
i
answer
the
matter
of
his
conversation
seems
to
me
to
be
visionary
yet
i
never
remember
him
to
be
so
clear
in
his
delivery
nor
so
elated
without
being
may
only
be
a
sign
of
the
disease
which
may
have
fastened
itself
upon
him
following
the
terrible
agony
of
grief
he
has
had
to
vivian
in
mercy
do
not
say
so
pray
do
not
i
do
not
think
he
is
deranged
do
you
not
remember
that
when
he
said
to
me
he
was
not
mad
how
coherently
he
spoke
i
entreat
you
vivian
not
to
say
you
think
his
mind
is
gone
if
you
do
i
shall
believe
hal
saw
the
tears
spring
into
her
eyes
and
he
blamed
himself
for
having
brought
them
there
especially
when
she
said
will
so
much
add
to
the
grief
i
have
already
would
not
add
to
it
for
the
world
miss
wilton
he
said
hastily
and
added
thoughtfully
may
have
been
selfishness
which
has
led
me
to
form
the
supposition
but
i
would
willingly
though
not
cheerfully
abandon
it
if
i
thought
by
so
doing
you
would
be
spared
one
painful
cheerfully
said
flora
with
innocent
surprise
with
reluctance
vivian
reluctance
miss
wilton
that
is
not
the
word
sorrow
is
the
truer
do
not
understand
you
i
am
i
suppose
very
dull
but
vivian
is
it
possible
that
you
could
be
sorry
to
find
my
father
not
insane
she
inquired
with
some
earnestness
he
said
what
your
father
has
said
be
not
the
wanderings
of
a
disturbed
mind
the
return
of
the
gentleman
who
has
recently
visited
him
from
india
has
opened
up
to
him
an
immediate
return
to
some
former
wealthy
position
even
though
the
instrument
appears
as
unconscious
of
his
power
to
effect
it
as
we
i
understand
it
returned
flora
finding
hal
pause
he
exclaimed
strong
feeling
being
manifest
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
should
not
i
trust
you
will
credit
me
be
sorry
that
he
had
achieved
his
immediate
release
from
this
filthy
prison
or
that
he
and
you
you
miss
wilton
were
restored
to
a
position
you
so
eminently
deserve
to
occupy
but
i
should
i
fear
grieve
to
think
that
all
your
good
could
not
be
accomplished
without
my
discomfort
asked
flora
catching
his
arm
and
looking
into
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
interest
for
which
he
would
have
willingly
pressed
her
to
his
heart
if
he
dared
he
was
a
little
confused
for
he
saw
plain
enough
that
if
he
had
no
heart
to
pain
her
she
had
no
desire
to
occasion
him
discomfort
miss
wilton
he
answered
speak
honestly
to
you
i
had
reared
up
a
little
fabric
based
upon
what
i
thought
to
be
your
condition
i
had
expected
from
it
much
happiness
perhaps
that
of
securing
to
you
immunity
from
troubles
and
trials
so
far
as
i
could
by
the
return
of
this
indian
officer
it
is
dashed
to
the
ground
and
shattered
to
atoms
i
rejoice
most
sincerely
that
it
has
brought
you
and
your
father
good
but
do
not
think
harshly
of
me
if
i
selfishly
regret
that
by
it
my
prospects
of
felicity
are
swept
away
entirely
in
the
time
to
come
when
difference
of
position
shall
part
us
for
ever
may
i
ask
you
flora
miss
wilton
to
believe
that
had
the
opportunity
been
afforded
me
i
would
when
tried
have
proved
to
you
a
sincere
and
a
true
friend
the
time
to
come
when
we
shall
part
for
ever
what
difference
of
station
should
part
us
oh
vivian
i
could
not
i
would
not
accept
a
position
which
might
bring
such
an
estrangement
to
pass
i
would
sooner
die
i
owe
my
life
to
your
she
seized
his
hand
and
kissed
it
and
then
burst
into
tears
hal
was
almost
in
the
act
of
placing
his
arm
about
her
and
giving
vent
to
a
passionate
declaration
when
a
hand
was
placed
upon
his
shoulder
he
turned
round
with
a
sudden
start
which
almost
upset
the
individual
who
had
touched
him
he
found
it
to
be
nathan
gomer
who
grinned
and
pointing
with
his
thumb
behind
him
said
to
flora
father
awaits
you
both
in
his
room
he
is
about
to
quit
the
prison
with
you
but
he
wishes
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
before

byron
helen
grahame
sat
in
her
alone
scarce
had
elapsed
since
she
had
quitted
the
side
of
lester
vane
after
their
stroll
in
the
garden
her
handkerchief
which
she
had
dropped
during
her
interview
with
hugh
riversdale
in
the
thicket
yet
glared
before
her
eyes
as
it
had
done
when
presented
by
him
who
with
a
sharp
penetrating
gaze
had
sought
to
extract
evidence
out
of
her
confusion
to
assure
him
that
she
was
the
heroine
of
the
stolen
interview
he
had
disturbed
she
yet
saw
it
floating
and
whirling
among
the
circling
eddies
of
the
meandering
waters
which
ran
past
her
feet
and
drew
such
small
consolation
from
the
possibility
of
its
never
being
again
recovered
at
least
to
her
disadvantage
as
it
might
afford
her
it
was
something
to
have
destroyed
the
only
evidence
that
could
identify
her
with
that
stolen
meeting
which
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
mystification
excitement
and
scandal
among
the
household
she
could
scarcely
prevent
a
proud
smile
of
triumph
curling
her
small
upper
lip
when
she
reflected
that
the
mastery
she
possessed
over
the
play
of
her
features
when
she
brought
her
will
into
action
had
enabled
her
to
baffle
the
scrutiny
of
vane
which
she
felt
instinctively
was
exerted
to
enable
him
to
obtain
power
over
her
her
womanly
instincts
were
too
acute
too
keen
for
her
not
to
comprehend
that
it
is
true
she
had
no
notion
that
he
intended
to
act
basely
or
falsely
to
her
in
spite
of
his
display
his
assumption
of
wealth
and
the
inferences
he
left
to
be
drawn
from
his
suggestions
she
entertained
a
conviction
that
his
sources
of
income
were
far
more
limited
in
capacity
than
he
wished
them
to
appear
her
reputed
affluence
of
the
reality
of
which
she
in
common
with
the
other
members
of
the
family
had
no
doubt
she
could
easily
understand
would
attract
the
attention
of
a
young
man
of
high
family
who
had
but
little
with
which
to
support
his
station
and
she
as
readily
comprehended
that
he
would
do
his
best
to
secure
the
hand
of
the
eldest
daughter
of
a
man
of
wealth
if
with
it
he
ensured
also
the
certainty
of
a
handsome
settlement
to
say
nothing
of
the
unquestionable
charms
of
the
he
would
have
to
take
with
the
gold
she
had
not
been
hours
in
his
company
before
she
detected
that
he
had
determined
upon
becoming
a
suitor
for
her
hand
having
fortified
himself
with
a
belief
that
her
father
would
give
with
her
a
dower
which
would
for
ever
set
at
rest
his
pecuniary
anxieties
for
the
future
but
she
revolted
at
the
thought
of
being
sought
for
what
she
should
bring
rather
than
for
her
beauty
her
heart
so
brimful
of
passion
and
tenderness
for
her
very
self
especially
did
she
recoil
from
the
supposition
that
she
was
a
to
be
lured
by
such
a
voice
for
the
purpose
of
his
own
aggrandisement
and
her
whole
soul
rose
in
rebellion
against
being
made
the
puppet
in
such
a
scheme
the
honorable
lester
vane
was
and
handsome
there
were
certain
points
in
his
figure
and
in
his
lineaments
of
a
character
to
attract
and
to
win
the
admiration
of
many
women
those
at
least
who
with
the
failing
of
their
sex
are
led
by
appearances
he
had
a
voice
and
a
tongue
gifted
with
the
soft
cunning
of
oily
phrases
in
so
eminent
a
degree
that
it
could
be
scarcely
surpassed
by
that
which
our
mother
eve
found
herself
unequal
to
resist
there
were
few
women
who
if
would
have
been
likely
to
resist
his
advances
or
to
have
remained
proof
against
them
were
he
to
address
himself
to
them
as
a
lover
hitherto
he
had
not
found
female
conquest
difficult
there
was
a
peculiarity
in
his
manner
and
appearance
which
interested
a
woman
in
his
favour
immediately
she
beheld
him
and
thus
having
mastered
the
approaches
he
where
he
listed
found
the
citadel
not
difficult
to
carry
by
a
de
helen
was
conscious
of
all
this
she
had
read
his
character
intuitively
and
had
formed
a
just
estimate
of
him
perhaps
her
predominant
feeling
towards
him
was
contempt
but
with
that
was
mingled
a
strange
dread
of
some
power
he
possessed
to
injure
her
and
which
at
a
future
period
he
would
exercise
with
a
merciless
malignity
she
knew
this
impression
had
no
foundation
in
fact
was
in
truth
a
mere
in
defined
sense
of
impending
evil
of
which
he
was
to
be
the
perpetrator
she
the
sufferer
yet
true
to
the
nature
of
her
sex
her
conclusion
arrived
at
by
no
process
of
reasoning
was
as
clear
and
determined
as
though
it
had
been
based
upon
a
train
of
facts
which
admitted
neither
of
doubt
nor
dispute
least
she
murmured
can
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
even
though
he
will
i
am
fully
convinced
omit
no
stratagem
to
gain
my
love
as
the
means
of
securing
my
hand
and
portion
the
portion
being
rather
a
considerable
item
in
the
object
he
proposes
to
accomplish
his
eye
looks
down
searchingly
into
my
heart
as
though
he
would
read
and
interpret
its
most
delicate
mysteries
and
fathom
its
secrets
that
he
may
hold
me
in
duress
never
i
defy
him
he
can
not
shall
not
detect
or
decipher
anything
i
may
purpose
to
conceal
he
has
destined
me
for
his
prey
a
golden
fly
to
be
enmeshed
in
the
entanglements
of
a
web
every
filament
of
which
is
too
palpable
in
my
eyes
ha
there
are
two
words
to
a
bargain
it
would
be
a
delicious
revenge
to
bring
this
schemer
down
upon
his
knees
before
me
actually
and
absolutely
an
abject
wooer
so
that
when
with
burning
words
and
scorching
tears
he
pleaded
his
love
i
might
spurn
him
with
my
foot
i
will
do
it
already
has
he
commenced
with
consummate
art
to
make
me
think
about
him
he
must
exercise
a
wily
skill
indeed
to
make
me
love
him
i
will
meet
him
upon
his
own
i
will
not
appear
to
employ
either
art
or
skill
yet
will
i
stake
my
happiness
that
i
will
compel
him
to
love
me
with
a
passionate
ardour
of
which
now
he
does
not
believe
his
soul
capable
ay
and
when
with
a
whirlwind
of
pleadings
urgings
and
fervid
prayers
he
implores
me
to
bestow
my
heart
upon
him
then
in
my
moment
of
triumph
i
will
open
up
to
his
terrible
discomfiture
my
full
knowledge
of
the
speculation
which
embraced
my
purse
with
my
person
and
laugh
with
derisive
scorn
at
so
shallow
an
attempt
to
win
and
wear
me
while
that
reference
to
herself
yet
trembled
upon
her
lips
a
thought
rushed
through
her
brain
and
a
flush
of
crimson
spread
itself
over
her
fair
neck
and
face
and
then
it
subsided
and
left
her
deadly
pale
at
this
moment
the
ring
at
the
given
with
skilful
force
resounded
suddenly
through
the
house
the
noise
made
her
start
and
utter
a
faint
scream
her
heart
began
to
beat
violently
while
a
strange
presentiment
seized
her
that
the
epistle
which
had
arrived
by
this
channel
was
for
her
an
emotion
of
dread
oppressed
her
for
which
she
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
she
had
but
few
correspondents
and
among
them
there
was
not
one
whose
communication
ought
to
contain
any
matter
to
occasion
her
feelings
of
dread
she
had
forgotten
one
she
listened
breathlessly
for
the
light
of
chayter
she
was
not
disappointed
the
door
opened
and
her
quiet
sleek
maid
entered
bearing
a
note
upon
a
small
silver
salver
helen
assumed
an
air
of
indifference
she
did
not
feel
she
glanced
from
beneath
her
long
dark
eyelashes
rapidly
at
the
letter
but
she
played
with
the
pendants
of
a
bracelet
and
yawned
in
face
letter
for
you
if
you
please
miss
said
the
girl
and
handed
it
to
her
it
down
chayter
said
she
will
read
it
by
and
by
i
am
in
no
humour
now
to
bore
over
a
long
crossed
scrawl
from
a
tiresome
school
the
girl
laid
the
letter
upon
the
small
table
at
elbow
remarking
to
herself
as
she
gazed
upon
the
superscription
that
the
school
friend
wrote
a
remark
ably
vigorous
masculine
hand

inquired
helen
with
seeming
apathy
although
deeply
interested
in
the
answer
the

if
you
please

girl
answered
mamma
and
the
rest
of
them

surprised
and
annoyed
to
hear
this
she
did
not
stay
to
inquire

upon
the
first
blush
it
seemed
to
her
that
lester
vane
had
no
right
to
be
alone
with
her
sister
she
was
irritated
and
vexed
not
as
she
suggested
to
herself
that
she
cared
because
she
had
a
contempt
for
the
man
but
then
to
preserve
merely
the
harmony
of
consistency
he
ought
to
be
alone
with
no
one
else
but
her
and
look
into
no
other
eyes
than
her
own
evangeline
too
so
reserved
so
shy
she
shook
her
head
perhaps
there
was
more
art
and
depth
in
that
apparently
timid
girl
than
any
of
them
had
ever
dreamed
of
she
determined
instantly
to
observe
her
more
closely
evangeline
hitherto
had
passed
as
a
stupid
harmless
nervous
child
yet
beneath
such
an
exterior
might
lurk
much
shrewd
sagacity
and
a
power
to
think
and
act
for
herself
for
which
she
had
not
previously
received
credit
helen
rather
prided
herself
upon
her
own
perceptive
faculties
and
like
many
of
her
sex
she
was
so
exceedingly
as
to
be
at
times
precipitated
into
forming
erroneous
conclusions
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
would
not
be
altogether
impolitic
to
put
in
an
appearance
rather
unexpectedly
in
the
drawingroom
where
vane
was
with
her
sister
a
glance
at
the
faces
of
both
she
assured
herself
would
suffice
to
tell
her
what
course
vane
was
pursuing
and
it
would
serve
to
direct
her
future
conduct
she
rose
with
this
intention
and
as
she
moved
past
her
little
table
her
eye
fell
upon
the
letter
which
the
sudden
communication
by
chayter
respecting
her
sister
and
lester
vane
had
caused
her
to
forget
she
turned
her
eyes
hastily
around
the
apartment
chayter
was
no
longer
there
she
was
alone
she
took
up
the
letter
and
held
it
to
the
lamp
so
that
she
might
see
the
superscription
clearly
she
started
as
she
recognised
the
handwriting
i
thought
so
she
ejaculated
is
from
hugh
how
thoughtless
to
address
to
me
here
she
examined
the
which
bore
the
name
of
southampton
she
drew
a
long
breath
as
though
to
nerve
herself
to
meet
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
she
felt
would
have
a
marked
influence
upon
her
future
destiny
and
then
she
broke
the
seal
the
contents
were
penned
by
a
hurried
and
trembling
hand
the
very
character
of
the
scrawled
letters
betrayed
the
workings
of
a
mind
convulsed
by
passion
and
sorrow
the
words
themselves
only
too
emphatically
proved
what
the
characters
suggested
she
read
with
burning
eyes
what
follows
thou
passionately
loved
measure
the
intensity
of
my
grief
when
you
learn
that
my
dread
forebodings
are
verified
i
sail
by
the
to
india
on
the
three
days
hence
my
agony
is
insupportable
to
be
parted
from
you
for
years
perhaps
never
more
to
meet
on
earth
drives
me
to
despair
distraction
i
could
refuse
to
quit
england
i
did
an
alternative
was
presented
to
me
it
involved
the
desolation
of
one
to
insure
whose
happiness
my
life
were
too
mean
a
gift
it
would
have
hurled
me
into
beggary
and
would
still
have
sundered
me
from
you
from
you
helen
you
my
the
font
from
whence
i
draw
the
only
joy
this
world
can
yield
me
what
could
i
do
the
chained
and
manacled
slave
had
more
freedom
of
action
than
i
my
choice
lay
between
this
loathed
voyage
and
comparative
annihilation
and
my
consent
to
leave
england
has
been
thus
wrung
from
me
helen
though
but
these
feeble
words
greet
your
tender
eyes
yet
i
am
with
you
face
to
face
near
near
to
you
in
a
cold
thrill
ran
through
the
frame
of
helen
as
she
read
these
words
and
she
raised
her
eyes
shrinking
and
gazing
into
the
misty
space
before
her
as
if
expecting
to
see
his
form
and
grim
standing
there
but
she
saw
only
the
pictures
on
the
walls
and
the
hanging
draperies
so
with
a
cold
tremor
she
went
on
with
the
perusal
of
the
letter
remember
helen
that
night
when
we
stood
together
in
the
abbey
ruins
alone
the
cold
grey
moonlight
streamed
through
the
oriel
window
shattered
and
decayed
it
was
and
rested
upon
a
mutilated
cross
you
remember
that
cross
helen
as
silver
like
it
stood
out
in
bold
relief
my
earnest
gaze
was
upon
it
helen
when
my
fevered
trembling
lips
uttered
words
in
your
ear
only
too
feeble
and
inexpressive
to
convey
the
depth
and
intensity
of
that
love
which
your
gentle
tenderness
and
your
unsurpassed
beauty
had
won
from
me
and
by
that
cross
i
swore
to
be
true
to
you
while
i
had
life
i
see
that
cross
now
helen
can
you
i
repeat
the
oath
i
took
on
that
night
will
you
oh
helen
dearest
you
do
not
forget
that
while
my
vow
was
yet
vibrating
in
your
ear
you
turned
your
lustrous
eyes
upon
that
glowing
emblem
of
mortal
redemption
your
sweet
head
reclined
upon
my
heaving
breast
and
in
faltering
words
you
owned
that
the
passion
was
not
unrequited
that
you
loved
me
your
warm
fragrant
breath
played
upon
my
cheeks
as
you
pointed
to
that
cross
and
called
heaven
to
witness
to
your
truth
to
testify
that
in
the
time
to
come
your
affection
should
be
as
unchanging
and
as
unchangeable
as
my
own
look
helen
there
see
you
not
that
cross
standing
sharply
and
brightly
out
from
the
shadows
beyond
will
you
refuse
the
duty
it
calls
upon
you
to
perform
or
forget
the
oath
it
commands
you
to
remember
out
of
my
deep
love
for
you
at
what
sacrifice
would
i
pause
what
hesitate
to
do
and
dare
that
you
might
be
mine
ah
helen
will
you
be
mine
as
you
have
so
often
fondly
sworn
you
were
and
would
be
ever
are
you
prepared
for
the
test
which
shall
prove
it
it
is
this
will
you
on
receipt
of
this
letter
join
me
here
will
you
helen
i
have
made
every
arrangement
by
which
you
can
travel
on
the
by
the
four
train
to
southampton
alone
and
secure
from
interruption
on
your
arrival
you
will
be
received
by
a
lady
who
will
be
expecting
you
and
will
conduct
you
to
apartments
prepared
for
you
on
the
we
will
be
united
by
marriage
as
we
have
been
by
love
and
nay
we
will
then
bid
farewell
to
england
with
hearts
light
and
free
for
come
any
evil
after
it
we
shall
at
least
be
happy
in
the
possession
of
each
other
and
can
no
more
be
parted
but
by
death
helen
my
own
helen
if
you
will
fly
to
me
the
devotion
of
a
life
will
be
too
poor
a
return
for
the
integrity
the
purity
the
magnanimity
of
your
love
if
you
come
not
well
words
would
be
idle
helen
staggered
to
her
chair
as
she
concluded
the
epistle
she
pressed
her
hands
to
her
throbbing
temples
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
she
had
not
the
power
for
a
minute
or
two
to
summon
a
single
thought
to
her
aid
remember
that
night
ay
the
events
crowded
into
it
were
not
likely
to
be
forgotten
by
her
as
her
hot
palms
pressed
down
her
eyelids
she
saw
as
in
a
vision
the
ruined
abbey
desolate
and
silent
in
the
broad
the
walls
the
dilapidated
aisles
the
windows
mouldering
and
falling
away
very
skeletons
of
what
they
had
once
been
the
rude
masses
of
masonry
half
buried
in
the
long
rank
grass
but
above
all
that
cross
that
cross
it
now
glittered
and
sparkled
and
wreathed
before
her
eyes
as
if
it
were
living
flame
and
darted
out
long
forked
arrowy
tongues
to
blister
and
consume
her
if
she
violated
her
oath
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
scream
and
a
shudder
of
horror
she
gazed
affrightedly
round
her
the
sight
of
her
maid
chayter
who
had
with
noiseless
step
reentered
the
room
however
dispelled
the
vision
and
restored
her
to
something
like
composure
she
looked
for
her
letter
it
was
open
upon
the
table
where
it
had
fallen
waving
her
hand
she
said
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
me
chayter
i
will
ring
when
i
require
your
the
girl
glanced
at
the
letter
and
then
at
her
mistress
she
gave
a
short
cough
is
growing
late
miss
she
said
hesitatingly
thought
me
almost
shrieked
the
haughty
beauty
stamping
her
foot
violently
the
girl
dropped
a
hurried
curtsey
and
slunk
swiftly
out
of
the
room
she
had
been
witness
to
small
displays
of
irritability
but
never
to
such
an
ebullition
of
temper
as
this
when
alone
helen
strode
to
the
door
and
locked
it
she
threw
herself
into
her
chair
and
again
pressed
her
beating
temples
with
her
hands
he
mad
she
murmured
with
him
and
to
india
how
selfish
how
unreasonable
he
asked
for
a
sacrifice
as
the
test
of
her
love
but
what
a
sacrifice
she
loved
him
he
ought
to
know
that
what
had
she
not
done
to
give
him
proofs
of
it
if
the
proofs
he
had
already
received
were
insufficient
what
could
suffice
not
even
the
very
sacrifice
he
called
upon
her
to
make
he
had
spoken
of
sacrifices
he
had
reminded
her
of
their
mutual
vow
but
now
he
sought
to
make
her
crown
those
cumulative
sacrifices
by
inducing
her
to
fling
away
all
personal
considerations
and
follow
his
fortunes
to
minister
to
his
happiness
by
the
surrender
of
her
own
not
that
she
doubted
she
should
be
happy
in
becoming
his
wife
but
then
there
was
so
much
that
went
to
make
up
the
sum
of
perfect
contentment
which
she
must
forego
upon
quitting
home
and
which
she
could
not
hope
to
possess
or
enjoy
after
she
had
linked
her
fate
with
his
trifles
are
they
at
best
but
to
have
pleasure
the
rule
and
retirement
the
exception
to
be
flattered
admired
the
cynosure
of
adoring
eyes
are
constituent
parts
of
many
a
happiness
wanting
only
the
love
of
one
to
make
a
perfect
felicity
helen
was
called
upon
to
make
her
election
she
could
not
it
appeared
have
done
both
if
she
flung
away
the
pleasures
of
the
world
and
the
comforts
of
wealth
she
would
have
to
be
compensated
by
passionate
love
and
entire
devotion
if
she
flung
away
his
love
well
there
was
still
her
luxurious
home
and
and
if
he
was
bent
upon
being
so
very
very
obstinate
in
his
selfish
demands
and
in
the
event
of
her
not
taking
part
in
his
wild
scheme
were
to
sunder
the
connection
between
them
well
there
were
others
moving
in
a
higher
sphere
than
his
who
would
kneel
at
her
feet
and
give
to
her
entire
and
undisputed
sway
so
that
she
but
bestowed
her
hand
upon
the
suppliant
will
write
to
him
she
said
taking
up
his
letter
and
placing
it
in
her
desk
which
she
carefully
locked
i
will
write
to
him
and
show
to
him
the
weakness
and
the
folly
of
what
he
asks
papa
would
be
frenzied
and
mamma
would
surely
die
of
mortified
pride
if
i
were
to
take
such
a
step
no
no
it
must
not
be
you
were
not
in
your
senses
hugh
when
you
addressed
that
letter
to
me
and
so
thoughtless
too
to
direct
it
here
poor
fellow
poor
dear
fellow
how
he
loves
me
how
deeply
dearly
he
truly
loves
me
dear
hugh
yes
i
well
remember
that
night
of
mutual
confession
oh
i
well
remember
the
tumult
of
joy
which
swelled
my
bosom
when
your
trembling
voice
and
nearly
inarticulate
words
told
me
that
which
i
already
instinctively
knew
but
which
i
so
longed
for
you
to
confess
my
dear
dear
hugh
to
what
result
the
train
of
reflection
now
taking
an
opposite
path
to
that
which
at
first
it
pursued
might
have
led
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
helen
was
here
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
followed
by
the
voice
of
chayter
who
informed
her
young
mistress
that
she
was
expected
in
the
inquiries
having
been
already
made
for
her
she
gave
a
rapid
glance
at
her
face
in
the
glass
it
was
pale
as
alabaster
but
there
was
no
further
trace
of
the
disorder
her
mind
had
suffered
and
so
assuming
a
calm
demeanour
she
admitted
chayter
do
believe
i
have
been
dozing
she
said
to
the
sleek
girl
believe
anything
of
the
kind
thought
chayter
but
smiling
said
me
miss
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
lovely
and
have
a
dozen
noble
and
beautiful
gentlemen
grieving
to
death
for
miss
it
is
as
i
say
continued
the
girl
can
see
there
is
his
grace
talking
of
nothing
but
you
and
the
honorable
vane
hoping
that
you
are
not
ill
because
you
keep
your
own
room
and
you
all
the
while
so
indifferent
dozing
in
your
chair
and
miss
margaret
looking
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
as
if
she
would
give
her
ears
to
be
taken
notice
of
by
either
of
me
chayter
exclaimed
helen
abruptly
if
you
can
pray
be
silent
your
volubility
makes
my
head
chayter
understood
a
hint
though
she
did
not
quite
comprehend
whether
volubility
meant
impertinence
or
overwhelming
information
she
gathered
from
tone
that
she
was
in
no
humour
to
listen
to
her
prattle
and
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
keep
her
tongue
still
when
its
rattle
was
likely
to
be
unwelcome
helen
quickly
made
her
toilet
and
had
seldom
looked
more
beautiful
than
she
did
when
she
entered
the
which
though
half
filled
by
the
guests
and
family
was
all
but
silent
without
her
her
eye
ran
round
the
apartment
as
she
glided
in
and
she
perceived
her
mamma
and
sister
margaret
conversing
together
her
papa
was
discoursing
with
the
young
duke
upon
the
management
of
estates
and
detailing
a
plan
by
which
to
obtain
the
largest
possible
amount
of
income
with
the
least
possible
expenditure
to
all
of
which
the
duke
appeared
to
listen
though
he
yawned
frequently
but
he
rescued
himself
from
the
charge
of
inattention
by
occasionally
observing
malcolm
was
upon
a
couch
and
lester
vane
was
seated
by
the
side
of
her
sister
evangeline
talking
with
her
in
a
tone
sufficiently
low
as
not
to
be
heard
at
least
where
she
stood
what
strange
feeling
was
it
that
possessed
her
when
her
eye
fell
upon
evangeline
and
lester
vane
as
it
were
why
did
a
flush
mount
to
her
brow
and
a
pang
of
vexation
shoot
through
her
breast
he
was
nothing
to
her
what
he
might
do
ought
to
have
no
interest
in
her
eyes
for
if
any
feeling
for
him
was
predominant
in
her
heart
it
was
not
certainly
of
a
favourable
nature
yet
he
had
gazed
upon
her
so
ardently
and
spoken
to
her
with
such
gentle
tones
that
if
she
could
draw
a
conclusion
from
his
manner
it
was
that
her
beauty
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
his
heart
now
to
see
his
dreamy
eyes
dwelling
on
innocent
face
so
earnestly
to
observe
his
impressive
manner
as
he
addressed
her
with
words
toned
so
as
to
make
her
gentle
heart
thrill
with
a
new
emotion
was
to
be
made
to
feel
that
she
had
made
no
impression
upon
him
at
all
or
that
he
made
love
to
her
simply
passer
le
she
burnt
with
vexation
shall
love
me
she
thought
me
kneel
to
me
oh
but
how
i
will
spurn
him
shatter
him
with
my
poor
hugh
riversdale
upon
the
appearance
of
helen
the
duke
of
st
allborne
flung
over
the
elaborate
dissertation
to
which
he
was
supposed
to
be
listening
and
quitting
mr
grahame
advanced
hastily
to
his
daughter
lester
vane
caught
sight
of
her
at
the
same
moment
and
rose
to
his
feet
but
without
evincing
any
emotion
other
than
that
of
pleasure
at
her
arrival
deah
miss
gwahame
exclaimed
the
duke

in
a
flutter
of
excitement

my
not
being
present
with
my
mamma
and
sisters
to
receive
you
in
the
replied
helen
favouring
him
with
one
of
her
most
bewitching
smiles
am
really
ashamed
to
acknowledge
to
your
grace
the
truth
but
i
am
afraid
that
while
reading
a
few
pages
of
a
novel
i
fell
into
the
most
unromantic
doze
the
duke
laughed
appreciatively
a
doze
after
dinner
who
comprehended
its
luxury
more
keenly
than
himself
apologise
miss
gwahame
he
exclaimed
think
a
nap
after
wine
one
of
the
wosiest
and
most
delicate
awdinations
of
helen
smiled
bewitchingly
again
at
the
duke
for
she
knew
the
eye
of
lester
vane
who
had
slowly
approached
her
was
on
her
face
lord
duke
she
returned
not
misinterpret
me
i
dozed
after
my
ha
laughed
the
duke
beg
pawdon
exactly
i
could
not
suppose
however
miss
gwahame
that
the
wine
you
sipped
at
dinnaw
would
have
thwown
you
into
a
doze
i
alluded
to
myself
eh
vane
this
girl
is
devilish
pwetty
thought
the
duke
as
he
turned
to
his
friend
is
a
pawfect
beauty
i
must
weally
wun
off
with
are
skilled
in
indulgence
you
are
in
fact
a
perfect
master
of
that
species
of
luxury
allbome
replied
vane
smiling
and
added
with
marked
to
helen
would
not
have
done
you
the
injustice
miss
grahame
to
have
presumed
that
a
slumber
had
denied
us
the
pleasure
of
your
fair
society
if
you
had
not
yourself
offered
it
in
explanation
of
your
absence
i
should
if
permitted
to
speculate
upon
your
movements
have
imagined
that
a
stroll
by
moonlight
along
the
sinuous
paths
of
the
most
excellently
arranged
garden
attached
to
this
mansion
had
occupied
you
pleasantly
that
tempted
by
the
beauty
of
the
night
or
some
other
cause
you
had
been
induced
to
linger
in
the
purple
shadows
thrown
upon
the
place
beneath
by
the
luxuriant
foliage
of
a
certain
cluster
of
graceful
trees
bending
in
pensive
reflection
over
the
flowing
stream
whose
rippling
waters
lave
their
base
the
balmy
air
responding
to
the
chant
of
the
low
music
with
soft
sighs
and
gently
fondling
in
its
murmuring
the
deep
green
leaves
still
and
silent
in
their
evening
the
duke
looked
up
at
his
friend
in
indescribable
astonishment
lester
vane
went
on
a
scene
miss
grahame
heightened
by
those
associations
your
own
glowing
thoughts
could
supply
would
naturally
furnish
an
ample
excuse
for
an
absence
so
much
regretted
by
all
present
may
i
suggest
that
you
should
adopt
it
rather
than
confess
to
an
afterdinner
nap
dreams
of
pumpkin
pie
interposed
helen
with
sarcastic
bitterness
and
a
very
formal
bend
she
understood
his
allusion
it
brought
a
scarlet
flush
on
her
cheek
and
made
her
eye
flash
like
a
diamond
her
lip
curled
scornfully
as
she
replied
to
him
and
if
the
sarcastic
tone
she
adopted
was
unnoticed
by
others
it
was
not
lost
upon
him
vane
she
added
not
concealing
an
expression
of
disdain
prefer
to
adhere
to
the
vulgar
truth
there
are
people
to
whom
such
a
course
is
inconvenient
but
i
find
it
less
troublesome
than
to
have
to
coin
a
number
of
small
prevarications
i
am
afraid
i
am
rather
an
unromantic
individual
i
catch
cold
and
have
bad
fits
of
sneezing
come
on
when
i
am
foolish
enough
to
be
tempted
by
some
poetical
enthusiast
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
a
moonlight
night
shadowy
trees
rippling
waters
and
sighing
breezes
on
those
occasions
there
is
always
a
quantity
of
mist
about
moist
exhalations
powerfully
suggestive
i
assure
you
vane
of
influenza
moonlight
scenes
are
very
pretty
things
at
the
opera
or
in
a
picture
but
the
reality
is
really
very
trying
to
the
vewy
weflections
i
have
frequently
made
myself
burst
forth

with
much
vivacity

miss
grahame
said
vane
nettled
by
the
tone
she
assumed
imagined
that
your
temperament
was
highly
sentimental
and
there
was
a
hidden
meaning
even
in
these
words
helen
detected
so
much
though
she
did
not
at
the
moment
perceive
the
object
at
which
the
shaft
was
levelled
she
replied
quickly
have
been
premature
vane
in
forming
your
estimate
of
my
character
i
am
not
so
easily
read
as
my
sister
evangeline
she
is
imbued
with
romance
as
no
doubt
you
have
before
this
discovered
she
trusts
to
seeming
poor
child
i
do
for
a
moment
her
eye
fastened
itself
piercingly
upon
him
she
then
took
the
ready
arm
and
advanced
up
the
to
a
magnificent
harp
to
fulfil
a
promise
made
by
her
to
the
duke
at
dinner
as
she
did
so
she
looked
for
evangeline
but
she
had
quitted
the
room
when
lester
vane
rose
up
to
greet
her
and
she
liked
not
her
disappearance
lester
vane
looked
after
helen
as
with
queenly
dignity
she
paced
the
room
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
his
bulky
ungraceful
friend
all
the
brighter
and
more
beautiful
for
the
contrast
am
right
he
mused
am
on
the
track
she
chafes
at
the
very
mention
of
garden
and
moonlight
my
experiment
too
succeeds
two
suns
may
not
shine
in
her
hemisphere
she
is
already
jealous
of
my
attention
to
her
little
simple
innocent
sister
there
is
power
in
that
i
will
use
it
i
will
have
her
completely
in
my
he
moved
towards
grahame
and
the
passionless
statue
her
daughter
margaret
perfectly
at
his
ease
and
as
unconcerned
as
though
the
incident
of
the
moment
alone
occupied
his
thoughts
helen
too
appeared
to
commence
her
task
in
perfect
serenity
of
mind
yet
the
words
remember
that
cross
helen
were
ringing
in
her
brain
and
though
she
sang
words
and
music
correctly
and
never
faltered
in
the
accompaniment
she
prayed
for
the
hour
of
release
from
the
presence
of
guests
the
sounds
of
voices
the
glaring
lights
to
be
again
alone
in
her
room
to
wrestle
with
memories
of
passion
and
promise
to
contend
with
conflicting
emotions
to
decide
upon
obeying
the
impulse
of
her
heart
or
to
determine
upon
one
great
sacrifice
in
order
to
secure
the
triumphs
of
a
brilliant
position
alone
what
would
she
not
have
given
at
that
moment
while
singing
with
such
charming
taste
to
have
been
alone
before
her
song
commenced
grahame
had
been
summoned
to
an
interview
with
some
person
who
required
to
see
him
on
business
of
importance
and
during
the
performance
of
the
song
while
approving
smiles
were
upon
the
features
of
his
guests
and
his
wife
and
daughter
margaret
sat
in
ineffable
elation
he
lay
upon
the
floor
of
his
library
in
a
fit
chapter
a
life
struggle
where
the
lamps
quiver
so
far
in
the
river
with
many
a
light
from
many
a
casement
from
garret
and
basement
she
stood
with
amazement
houseless
by
night
the
bleak
wind
of
march
made
her
tremble
and
shiver
but
not
the
dark
arch
or
the
black
flowing
river
mad
from
history
glad
to
mystery
swift
to
be
anywhere
anywhere
out
of
the
world
hood
within
a
close
narrow
chamber
upon
a
miserable
bed
sparely
provided
with
bedclothes
lay
a
young
girl
weak
and
wasted
struggling
in
the
deadly
grip
of
a
fierce
fever
the
room
a
back
attic
bore
evidence
of
the
humble
position
of
the
householder
and
in
addition
to
its
native
foul
atmosphere
was
impregnated
with
the
sickly
odour
prevalent
in
chambers
in
which
there
is
sickness
a
truckle
bed
a
table
a
chair
comprised
the
furniture
a
soiled
and
ragged
curtain
at
the
window
comprehended
all
the
room
possessed
in
the
shape
of
drapery
or
hangings
the
walls
were
bare
and
washed
with
the
odious
distemper
colour
so
prevalent
in
prisons
and
apartments
in
poor
neighbourhoods
the
with
wide
interstices
between
them
and
large
here
and
there
where
mice
looked
up
and
unspareable
halfpence
sometimes
rolled
down
had
not
even
a
show
of
comfort
in
the
way
of
a
small
bit
of
old
by
the
bedside
all
within
and
around
bespoke
poverty
of
the
grimmest
school
the
girl
who
lay
upon
the
bed
moaning
in
a
disturbed
slumber
with
flushed
cheeks
and
pale
and
transparent
lips
was
no
other
than
lotte
clinton
upon
the
night
of
the
fire
when
landed
safely
by
the
conductor
of
the
she
found
herself
in
her
thin
exposed
to
the
cold
night
air
which
struck
chill
to
her
unprotected
bosom
while
her
naked
tender
feet
were
upon
the
hard
stones
ankle
deep
in
rushing
water
the
shock
she
had
experienced
on
being
awakened
out
of
a
deep
slumber
by
the
startling
horrifying
cry
of
fire
the
terror
which
all
but
paralysed
her
when
and
nearly
suffocated
she
discovered
her
room
filled
with
smoke
the
excitement
which
followed
the
rushing
from
her
chamber
the
roaring
of
the
flames
the
crackling
and
sputtering
of
the
burning
wood
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
mob
the
perilous
descent
to
the
ground
the
sudden
exposure
to
the
eager
gaze
of
a
multitude
of
faces
red
in
the
glaring
unnatural
light
the
whirl
the
turmoil
mingled
with
a
species
of
hysterical
joy
and
gratefulness
at
her
deliverance
created
a
combination
of
emotions
beyond
her
physical
powers
of
endurance
it
is
not
wonderful
that
affrighted
unknowing
where
to
turn
whither
to
go
what
to
do
chilled
to
the
marrow
by
the
piercing
coldness
of
the
water
rushing
over
her
unprotected
delicate
feet
utterly
overwhelmed
by
what
had
happened
by
the
incidents
surrounding
her
and
in
which
she
was
yet
an
actor
she
should
succumb
and
find
that
as
some
person
hastily
and
roughly
seized
her
about
the
waist
she
should
have
a
dim
consciousness
that
the
whole
scene
was
fading
from
her
as
some
expiring
terrible
vision
and
that
when
it
disappeared
from
her
eyes
she
should
be
lifeless
in
the
arms
of
the
person
who
had
caught
hold
of
her
the
man
who
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
was
a
small
tradesman
dealing
in
coals
and
potatoes
and
a
little
a
very
little
greengrocery
he
lived
in
a
neighbouring
street
in
a
small
house
and
was
blessed
with
a
wife
and
nine
children
who
were
up
somehow
he
was
one
of
the
first
on
the
spot
when
the
alarm
of
fire
was
given
he
saw
lotte
landed
from
the
he
observed
the
agonized
expression
upon
the
poor
face
heard
her
low
hysteric
sobbing
and
saw
her
totter
as
though
she
would
fall
upon
her
face
in
the
muddy
eddying
pool
in
which
barefooted
she
was
standing
it
was
enough
for
him
he
drew
off
instantly
his
heavy
coat
of
cable
cord
and
flinging
it
over
her
shoulders
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
and
raced
off
to
his
old
with
his
burden
followed
by
a
small
train
of
women
and
boys
his
wife
was
no
little
astonished
at
this
sudden
accession
to
her
household
but
her
womanly
sympathy
was
roused
immediately
she
beheld
the
condition
of
the
poor
girl
and
learned
that
she
had
been
rescued
from
the
raging
fire
which
her
husband
had
so
short
a
time
previously
run
off
to
see
and
she
at
once
busied
herself
by
applying
those
restoratives
known
to
most
women
which
though
simple
are
efficacious
in
restoring
to
consciousness
those
of
the
sex
who
fall
into
swoons
lotte
clinton
being
a
girl
of
strong
feelings
was
not
however
easily
brought
to
a
calm
sense
of
her
great
affliction
on
the
contrary
she
recovered
from
one
fainting
fit
only
to
fall
into
another
worse
than
its
predecessor
and
when
by
the
aid
of
the
parish
doctor
who
had
been
called
in
she
was
relieved
from
successive
swoons
and
thrown
into
a
sleep
it
was
only
to
awake
in
a
paroxysm
of
fever
and
delirium
two
days
she
lay
thus
on
the
third
late
at
night
when
the
parish
doctor
made
his
appearance
in
order
that
he
might
see
his
patient
the
last
thing
he
stood
with
the
woman
of
the
house
at
the
of
the
poor
girl
two
or
three
anxious
questions
were
put
to
him
but
he
shook
his
head
as
the
woman
thought
ominously
is
rapidly
approaching
a
crisis
he
said
the
dawn
her
fate
will
be
decided
she
has
in
her
favour
youth
and
a
good
constitution
but
it
is
impossible
to
tell
what
may
result
from
the
ravages
of
so
fierce
a
fever
as
that
under
which
she
is
suffering
we
must
hope
for
the
best
and
leave
the
rest
in
the
hands
of
god
i
think
it
would
be
proper
to
make
her
friends
acquainted
with
her
condition
and
the
sooner
they
are
here
at
her
the
better
will
be
their
chance
of
taking
their
last
farewell
of
those
were
dread
words
shadows
did
they
cast
the
woman
raised
her
apron
to
her
eyes
and
gulped
audibly
once
or
twice
know
where
to
find
her
friends
if
she
has
any
poor
child
she
said
huskily
jem
picked
her
up
out
the
fire
and
brought
her
here
been
to
ax
after
her
and
we
know
where
to
go
never
been
in
her
senses
since
she
was
here
else
i
should
have
got
her
to
tell
me
but
lawk
lawk
it
is
a
sad
thing
for
a
poor
girl
like
this
to
die
away
from
home
and
a
friend
or
relation
to
close
her
poor
dear
eyes
a
mother
myself
sir
god
knows
i
should
be
dreadful
wretched
if
one
of
my
babbies
was
to
die
away
from
me
in
this
lonesome
the
poor
woman
sobbed
unaffectedly
as
she
concluded
the
doctor
with
a
glittering
tear
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
laid
his
hand
gently
upon
her
shoulder
there
is
life
there
is
hope
bantom
he
said
kindly
is
too
early
to
despair
yet
had
the
young
woman
nothing
about
her
when
your
husband
saved
her
no
letter
bless
you
nothing
on
but
those
night
things
you
see
on
her
not
a
blessed
rag
else
my
jem
has
been
a
trying
if
he
could
learn
anything
about
her
but
lor
he
goes
about
such
matters
in
sech
a
bladderheaded
sort
way
that
i
wonder
at
his
making
a
bad
out
on
it
he
lurches
and
prowls
about
when
he
goes
to
ax
for
his
own
in
sech
a
way
that
people
are
on
him
it
was
only
the
other
day
he
went
for
a
little
bill
which
it
was
a
long
time
a
we
wanted
the
money
badly
when
he
explained
what
come
for
in
sech
an
in
and
out
round
about
sort
a
way
that
the
people
sent
for
a
policeman
come
on
the
sneak
to
prig
the
and
mats
in
the
the
doctor
could
hardly
forbear
a
smile
he
turned
his
eyes
however
on
face
and
bent
his
head
down
closely
to
listen
to
her
breathing
he
felt
her
pulse
timing
its
rapid
beats
by
his
watch
then
he
laid
down
the
unresisting
hand
and
addressed
himself
to
ban
tom
thing
he
said
is
very
very
ill
if
she
wakes
shortly
give
to
her
a
dose
of
the
medicine
i
have
brought
with
me
she
must
have
it
especially
if
she
be
violent
incoherent
and
resists
your
attempts
to
administer
it
should
it
not
have
the
effect
of
pacifying
her
send
for
me
at
once
good
night
bantom
pray
to
god
to
spare
her
for
she
is
on
the
threshold
of
death
he
concluded
with
much
solemnity
in
his
tone
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
room
she
lighted
him
down
the
stairs
and
when
she
heard
the
close
she
returned
to
the
sick
room
to
watch
by
the
side
of
her
friendless
patient
her
husband
and
her
children
were
in
bed
he
had
his
long
hard
work
to
perform
on
the
morrow
and
rest
was
essential
to
him
the
little
colony
of
children
were
better
where
they
were
than
anywhere
else
bantom
too
had
her
share
of
hard
work
cut
out
for
her
for
the
next
day
and
required
sleep
but
she
did
not
heed
it
she
thought
only
of
the
poor
young
creature
who
she
believed
to
be
rapidly
quitting
her
brief
earthly
career
for
one
that
would
have
no
limit
by
the
feeble
rays
of
the
miserable
rushlight
burning
she
watched
the
flushed
face
of
lotte
perceiving
it
become
each
minute
more
crimson
and
saw
her
bosom
heave
and
fall
and
she
listened
with
a
beating
heart
to
her
stertorous
breathing
she
saw
her
head
roll
from
side
to
side
her
burning
hands
open
and
shut
and
clutch
at
the
she
heard
with
an
aching
heart
the
low
moan
of
pain
which
oozed
as
it
were
with
prolonged
mournful
cadence
from
the
lips
of
the
poor
girl
and
she
prepared
for
the
sudden
and
violent
awakening
to
which
the
doctor
had
alluded
but
lotte
became
silent
and
motionless
again
the
only
change
in
her
was
that
her
tongue
white
and
rigid
protruded
from
her
mouth
the
heart
of
good
bantom
smote
her
as
she
observed
it
and
she
feared
that
the
fatal
moment
was
indeed
at
hand
she
however
performed
her
duty
as
a
nurse
with
watchful
perseverance
and
with
some
grapes
which
the
doctor
had
brought
she
moistened
the
dry
and
parched
tongue
of
poor
lotte
this
gentle
attention
persevered
in
passed
not
unrewarded
she
could
see
it
had
a
grateful
influence
though
as
it
seemed
to
her
lotte
was
dying
in
an
unconscious
state
and
would
breathe
her
last
without
making
any
sign
so
though
she
knew
only
the
prayers
taught
to
her
in
childhood
and
seldom
went
to
a
place
of
worship
she
remembered
the
words
of
the
doctor
and
she
knelt
down
by
the
bedside
she
was
unacquainted
with
the
subtleties
of
contending
faiths
she
had
a
faith
which
went
deeper
she
believed
implicitly
in
the
supreme
power
of
god
in
his
ability
to
give
and
to
take
away
in
that
spirit
she
appealed
to
him
she
prayed
to
him
in
earnest
sincerity
to
grant
to
the
motionless
friendless
girl
stretched
on
the
bed
before
her
a
longer
term
if
that
by
a
more
extended
sojourn
on
earth
she
might
know
a
greater
happiness
than
had
perhaps
yet
been
her
lot
but
that
if
it
was
the
divine
will
to
remove
her
hence
she
implored
him
with
earnest
heart
though
with
all
humility
and
reverence
to
take
her
to
his
bosom
that
the
shadow
of
sorrow
or
affliction
might
fall
upon
her
never
more
when
her
prayer
was
ended
she
turned
her
eyes
suffused
with
tears
upon
her
unconscious
patient
she
started
the
hectic
crimson
of
the
cheek
had
paled
down
and
was
fast
changing
to
a
pallid
hue
it
seemed
even
that
on
her
brow
a
moisture
had
appeared
the
heavy
breathing
had
abated
as
had
the
moaning
and
uneasy
movement
of
head
and
hands
suddenly
eyes
opened
and
she
gazed
feebly
around
her
she
looked
intently
at
the
bare
walls
the
scanty
furniture
and
then
earnestly
upon
bantom
who
was
watching
her
every
motion
with
absorbing
eagerness
at
length
in
a
low
voice
she
murmured
wonderingly
where
am
i
who
are
you
what
strange
place
is
this
own
common
sense
told
her
that
the
crisis
was
over
and
so
far
the
life
was
saved
with
a
burst
of
gratitude
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
together
my
god
you
have
listened
to
my
prayer
you
have
heard
me
a
sinner
you
have
spared
her
tears
checked
her
voice
and
she
buried
her
face
once
more
in
the
lotte
regarded
her
with
surprise
as
indeed
she
did
the
whole
situation
she
felt
strangely
weak
and
powerless
had
she
been
ill
what
did
it
all
mean
she
repeated
the
question
in
a
low
voice
and
then
bantom
jumped
up
and
hurried
to
the
medicine
bottle
she
poured
out
a
dose
and
said
as
tenderly
as
if
lotte
was
her
own
child
drink
that
like
a
good
girl
and
ask
a
single
question
until
you
are
stronger
it
will
be
quite
time
enough
to
know
all
lotte
would
have
persisted
but
bantom
was
peremptory
and
she
was
obliged
to
succumb
within
ten
minutes
after
the
medicine
had
been
administered
she
was
asleep
the
battle
had
been
fought
youth
constitution
and
judicious
treatment
had
won
the
victory
the
abatement
of
the
symptoms
was
as
rapid
as
had
been
the
attack
of
the
fever
and
in
two
days
more
lotte
was
able
to
sit
up
in
bed
and
communing
with
herself
come
to
a
full
knowledge
of
the
peculiarity
and
the
distressing
nature
of
her
situation
she
had
in
the
interval
between
the
crisis
and
the
present
moment
followed
the
directions
of
the
doctor
obeyed
his
instructions
and
swallowed
his
medicine
with
the
intrepidity
of
a
martyr
the
result
had
been
all
that
could
be
desired
in
her
progress
to
health
fresh
air
was
only
needed
to
complete
the
rest
how
was
that
to
be
got
at
how
at
present
could
she
obtain
more
than
came
in
at
her
window
she
had
no
clothes
all
had
been
destroyed
at
the
fire
everything
had
been
consumed
including
the
very
little
money
she
had
her
very
first
impulse
had
been
on
coming
to
a
sense
of
her
position
to
send
for
her
brother
charley
but
alas
a
had
embezzled
upwards
of
a
thousand
pounds
from
the
firm
to
which
they
both
belonged
and
had
absconded
charley
had
been
at
once
charged
to
accompany
a
detective
engaged
to
pursue
him
to
america
and
he
had
started
on
the
very
night
of
the
fire
he
was
already
on
the
atlantic
leaving
the
shores
of
england
at
the
rate
of
three
hundred
miles
per
day
he
had
despatched
a
hasty
note
to
lotte
informing
her
of
the
mission
upon
which
he
had
been
despatched
and
directing
her
should
she
require
a
little
pecuniary
assistance
during
his
absence
to
apply
in
his
name
to
his
firm
and
it
would
be
readily
afforded
her
this
letter
she
never
got
charley
had
slipped
it
into
the
of
a
on
his
way
to
the
euston
station
and
it
was
conveyed
to
its
destination
by
the
postman
on
the
following
morning
but
as
he
was
not
able
to
deliver
it
he
returned
to
the
dead
letter
office
first
carefully
writing
upon
it
burnt
down
gone
away
not
known
bantom
was
however
employed
by
lotte
as
a
messenger
to
her
brother
to
inform
him
of
her
sad
misfortune
but
he
pursued
his
inquiries
for
charley
in
a
manner
so
mysterious
that
he
raised
in
the
mind
of
the
clerk
whom
he
addressed
a
strong
impression
that
charley
clinton
was
deeply
his
debtor
for
coals
and
greengrocery
now
was
never
out
of
debt
and
had
an
intense
loathing
for
all
creditors
they
were
he
used
to
say
so
offensively
pertinacious
even
when
they
had
got
an
answer
therefore
he
replied
to
questions
with
curt
brevity
all
bantom
could
gather
was
that
charles
clinton
had
sailed
for
america
and
his
return
was
a
question
involved
in
obscurity
and
the
clerk
facetiously
added
might
not
be
for
years
and
it
might
not
be
for
this
intelligence
was
a
sad
blow
to
lotte
what
to
do
she
could
not
tell
the
honest
people
who
had
taken
her
in
to
their
humble
house
lived
too
closely
from
hand
to
mouth
to
aid
her
indeed
she
was
already
a
burden
to
them
they
could
ill
nay
could
not
afford
to
keep
her
this
she
was
at
no
loss
to
comprehend
by
what
she
heard
and
saw
after
her
passion
of
bitter
bitter
tears
on
learning
that
charley
had
gone
to
another
quarter
of
the
globe
had
passed
away
she
consulted
with
bantom
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
can
not
lie
here
she
exclaimed
shall
worry
myself
to
death
if
i
could
get
out
i
could
get
work
i
could
in
some
way
repay
you
for
your
kindness
bantom
but
to
be
kept
thus
oh
i
had
better
died
better
have
she
wrung
her
hands
and
sobbed
violently
no
use
your
taking
on
in
this
way
said
bantom
to
her
ready
to
mingle
her
tears
with
her
for
to
say
truth
the
poor
creature
was
easily
moved
to
weep
turn
up
be
bound
my
things
is
too
big
for
you
and
too
poor
besides
i
got
much
i
stand
upright
in
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
hit
on
a
way
to
dress
you
afore
long
so
worrit
yourself
as
for
the
bit
you
eats
lor
that
among
so
many
on
us
there
there
hold
your
tongue
gal
and
keep
your
spirits
up
find
a
way
to
help
and
so
she
did
she
went
among
her
neighbours
to
make
up
the
different
articles
that
constitute
the
dress
of
a
woman
and
poor
as
nearly
all
of
whom
she
begged
were
none
when
they
heard
frightful
story
refused
her
appeal
the
poor
never
refuse
to
help
the
poor
if
they
have
any
means
her
last
application
however
should
have
been
her
first
for
it
was
to
a
young
girl
about
own
age
and
figure
she
was
an
artificial
florist
a
worker
too
of
eighteen
hours
out
of
the
a
diligent
unmurmuring
white
slave
she
was
able
to
sympathise
with
poor
lotte
and
she
generously
offered
to
lend
her
all
the
clothes
she
would
require
until
she
obtained
work
and
would
be
able
to
return
them
with
delight
bantom
accepted
her
offer
and
conveyed
the
clothes
to
lotte
with
yet
greater
delight
did
the
poor
girl
attire
herself
in
them
and
hurry
to
the
house
for
which
she
had
worked
before
the
fire
had
rendered
her
homeless
she
revealed
her
unhappy
position
to
the
individual
who
had
employed
her
there
are
few
like
him
thank
heaven
he
listened
coldly
to
her
statement
and
finding
that
six
dozen
cap
fronts
his
property
had
been
consumed
in
the
fire
instead
of
commiserating
her
abruptly
informed
her
that
she
must
pay
for
the
blonde
and
flowers
before
she
had
any
more
work
and
if
in
two
days
she
did
not
bring
to
him
the
amount
he
would
pay
her
a
visit
accompanied
by
a
policeman
sickened
and
affrighted
lotte
hurried
from
the
house
her
hopes
once
more
dashed
to
the
ground
her
heart
bursting
with
agony
no
one
to
go
to
for
counsel
or
assistance
what
was
to
be
done
almost
frantic
she
wandered
about
without
an
aim
feeling
that
she
could
not
go
back
to
the
kind
people
who
had
sheltered
her
unless
she
had
some
prospect
of
lifting
herself
out
of
her
desolate
destitution
and
recompensing
them
at
least
for
her
board
although
she
could
never
repay
the
service
and
the
attention
they
had
rendered
to
her
she
wandered
through
the
streets
growing
weak
and
faint
from
an
exertion
to
which
she
was
not
equal
and
from
being
many
hours
without
food
gradually
becoming
desperate
as
hopeless
she
thought
of
the
coming
night
and
the
dark
waters
that
swept
silently
beneath
the
frowning
arches
of
the
bridges
which
spanned
their
breadth
and
an
thought
kept
ringing
in
her
ears
anywhere
out
of
the
world
suddenly
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
printed
bill
it
said
thousand
hands
wanted
not
a
second
elapsed
between
her
discovery
of
that
bill
and
the
resting
of
her
trembling
hand
upon
the
knocker
of
the
door
her
timid
summons
was
responded
to
and
her
application
for
work
met
with
success
she
was
requested
to
enter
a
room
and
to
sit
down
and
a
she
was
furnished
with
materials
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
produced
a
which
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
employer
the
answers
to
inquiries
put
to
her
being
deemed
satisfactory
materials
for
twelve
dozen
fronts
were
given
to
her
in
a
box
which
she
was
to
return
with
her
work
with
a
light
heart
and
a
heavy
parcel
she
returned
to
bantom
constant
work
was
promised
to
her
provided
she
was
punctual
and
her
work
was
approved
of
she
had
no
fears
about
that
she
promised
the
work
on
the
following
friday
night
the
task
could
only
be
accomplished
by
incessant
toil
but
she
resolved
to
accomplish
it
and
she
did
in
the
little
squalid
bedroom
she
sat
to
her
exacting
toil
few
were
the
hours
of
sleep
she
obtained
during
the
time
between
the
commencement
and
the
close
of
her
labours
but
she
was
rewarded
by
completing
the
last
front
within
an
hour
of
the
time
specified
more
fit
for
bed
than
for
a
journey
through
the
crowded
streets
she
staggered
rather
than
walked
to
the
house
of
her
new
employer
her
work
was
given
in
and
it
was
commended
she
was
told
to
come
the
following
evening
at
six
the
time
when
the
workers
were
paid
and
bring
her
book
when
she
would
receive
the
money
due
to
her
and
more
work
would
be
given
to
her
elated
she
returned
to
her
poor
abode
and
slept
happily
that
night
at
least
she
had
in
five
days
and
nights
there
was
not
much
to
be
taken
out
for
sleep
earned
ten
shillings
she
hoped
the
next
week
to
earn
a
like
sum
and
by
assisted
by
the
kind
forbearance
of
the
bantoms
to
gradually
clear
off
her
debt
and
to
get
herself
clothes
which
she
should
wear
with
the
satisfaction
that
they
were
her
own
ah
she
raised
up
wonderful
and
glittering
fabrics
but
they
were
based
upon
most
intangible
foundations
however
she
slumbered
lightly
and
rose
refreshed
busying
herself
the
whole
of
the
day
in
lightening
labours
by
assisting
her
in
attending
to
her
small
regiment
of
blessings
at
six
the
next
evening
punctually
and
with
anxious
hopes
she
stood
before
the
house
of
her
new
employer
she
looked
up
wistfully
at
it
it
wore
a
peculiar
air
of
silence
and
dulness
which
she
had
not
before
observed
she
did
not
pause
to
think
upon
the
impression
thus
suddenly
raised
but
knocked
at
the
door
a
pang
smote
her
breast
as
it
occurred
to
her
that
a
hollow
sound
echoed
through
the
house
on
the
fall
of
the
knocker
as
though
it
was
empty
she
instinctively
again
cast
her
eyes
upwards
the
windows
were
all
closed
there
were
no
blinds
but
all
was
dark
within
the
house
and
so
still
so
dreadfully
still
she
waited
her
summons
remained
unanswered
she
knocked
again
the
same
hollow
sound
reverberated
through
the
building
and
her
heart
began
to
sink
and
die
within
her
a
young
girl
now
came
up
stopped
at
the
door
and
knocked
she
was
bound
upon
the
same
errand
as
lotte
save
that
a
work
was
due
to
her
she
had
scrambled
and
starved
over
the
past
week
she
scarcely
knew
how
wan
and
weak
but
full
of
hope
she
was
here
for
the
miserable
sum
for
which
she
had
bartered
health
exhausted
her
strength
and
perilled
her
young
life
there
was
no
answer
to
her
knock
at
the
door
save
the
same
hollow
mocking
echo
as
before
another
girl
made
her
appearance
a
third
a
fourth
a
fifth
a
sixth
all
here
upon
one
errand
to
claim
the
scanty
sum
for
which
they
had
worked
almost
from
dawn
to
dawn
they
spoke
to
each
other
questioningly
they
looked
into
each
eyes
with
dread
apprehension
and
they
conversed
in
low
excited
tones
the
wages
they
had
come
to
receive
had
been
earned
with
a
it
was
to
them
of
vital
consequence
one
or
two
had
homes
and
parents
upon
whom
to
fall
back
for
assistance
but
the
loss
of
the
money
to
the
others
left
them
only
a
choice
between
the
streets
and
the
river
lotte
grasped
at
a
railing
near
her
for
support
a
throng
of
sharp
ringing
sounds
rushed
through
her
brain
she
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
she
could
not
have
uttered
a
sound
her
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
her
throat
swelled
and
contracted
as
though
it
would
stifle
her
she
began
to
lose
her
perception
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
everything
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
a
harrowing
consciousness
that
her
beggary
her
loneliness
and
desolation
had
assumed
proportions
of
more
terrible
magnitude
than
they
had
ever
yet
done
that
they
surpassed
her
power
to
endure
them
longer
she
had
a
dim
impression
that
a
person
residing
next
door
told
them
all
that
their
employer
had
fled
with
his
goods
ere
daybreak
no
one
knew
whither
sickened
lotte
quitted
her
hold
of
the
railing
which
had
sustained
her
and
staggered
away
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
her
way
to
the
black
and
murky
river
careering
swiftly
and
noiselessly
through
the
heart
of
the
vast
metropolis
down
to
the
sea
river
the
river
those
were
the
only
words
she
muttered
these
words
of
such
terrible
significance
seemed
to
be
shrieked
by
demons
in
her
ears
she
saw
them
in
fiery
characters
dancing
like
before
her
leading
her
on
to
her
doom
she
followed
unresistingly
how
she
found
her
way
what
route
she
chose
to
the
she
knew
not
cared
not
she
reached
a
bridge
that
spanned
the
dark
waters
ere
she
was
conscious
of
her
proximity
to
that
grave
which
could
be
by
one
desperate
plunge
and
now
the
fearful
act
she
contemplated
presented
itself
in
its
most
awful
guise
before
her
despairing
eyes
but
not
to
deter
her
from
her
frantic
purpose
no
if
she
remained
on
earth
her
future
was
all
black
and
unshapen
there
was
rest
and
immunity
from
the
horrors
of
want
and
destitution
in
the
grave
she
knelt
down
and
prayed
she
compressed
her
hands
tightly
together
a
wild
hysteric
groan
forced
from
her
by
the
intense
anguish
created
by
her
unutterable
thoughts
burst
from
her
lips
and
she
hurried
on
to
the
bridge
to
end
by
one
fearful
plunge
her
sorrows
and
her
young
life
as
she
swept
on
to
a
recess
blinded
by
her
misery
maddened
by
a
despair
devoid
of
one
glimmering
of
hope
the
glare
from
one
of
the
lamps
fell
upon
her
ghastly
face
at
that
instant
a
strong
hand
caught
her
by
the
wrist
and
a
friendly
voice
exclaimed
clinton
miss
clinton
she
fell
back
against
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
the
voice
changed
its
tone
for
one
of
horror
and
surprise
and
it
said
heaven
what
is
the
matter
with
you
how
deadly
white
you
are
what
has
happened
where
are
you
going
die
to
die
she
murmured
hoarsely
but
faintly
hush
my
dear
friend
said
he
who
stayed
her
in
a
soft
and
slightly
reproving
tone
and
added
yourself
i
entreat
you
do
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
so
collect
your
thoughts
and
then
turn
your
eyes
on
me
i
am
a
friend
i
have
a
right
to
that
title
and
you
will
acknowledge
it
presently
i
claim
to
aid
you
in
affliction
or
trial
you
will
not
i
am
sure
miss
clinton
refuse
consolation
or
help
in
need
from
harry
lotte
uttered
a
faint
hysteric
cry
she
clutched
his
arm
and
bowed
her
head
upon
his
breast
she
knew
he
had
the
power
to
help
her
she
knew
he
would
as
she
clung
to
him
he
felt
her
frame
tremble
and
quiver
as
though
she
had
been
smitten
with
an
ague
and
her
hot
tears
fell
fast
upon
the
hand
which
held
hers
and
pressed
it
he
let
her
weep
in
a
few
minutes
he
whispered
will
not
stay
here
lotte
it
is
chill
and
cold
and
we
excite
attention
from
the
he
conducted
her
from
the
bridge
but
a
few
steps
only
for
she
was
nearly
powerless
and
unable
longer
to
continue
the
struggle
without
fatigue
he
quickly
perceived
it
and
had
some
notion
of
the
cause
so
he
said
am
so
glad
i
have
found
you
at
last
i
have
made
many
efforts
since
the
night
of
the
fire
to
discover
you
but
in
vain
not
alone
to
satisfy
my
own
anxiety
respecting
you
but
to
allay
the
apprehensions
of
your
friend
miss
wilton
to
whom
you
were
so
kind
in
her
hour
of
bitter
trial
ah
lotte
her
misery
is
all
past
her
future
life
promises
to
be
one
of
supreme
happiness
if
wealth
and
station
can
ensure
it
come
to
her
now
she
so
wishes
to
see
you
again
it
is
not
so
far
a
cab
will
quickly
take
us
to
her
you
will
have
at
least
a
kindly
sympathetic
ear
in
which
to
pour
your
sorrows
and
who
knows
the
meeting
between
you
may
be
the
termination
of
all
your
trials
and
lotte
tried
to
reply
an
inarticulate
murmur
was
all
that
escaped
her
lips
her
deep
emotion
did
not
so
easily
admit
of
suppression
a
cab
opportunely
approached
and
hal
engaged
it
he
lifted
lotte
in
she
had
not
power
to
help
herself
he
followed
her
into
the
vehicle
and
gave
his
directions
to
the
driver
the
man
whipped
his
horse
and
the
cab
rattled
away
from
the
bridge
lotte
thought
of
the
sombre
river
whirling
on
grimly
and
she
shuddered
violently
hal
pressed
her
hand

lotte
he
whispered

pope
dissertation
upon
the
improvement
of
land
and
the
general
economy
and
management
of
estates
had
been
abruptly
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
his
daughter
into
the
room
where
the
guests
and
family
were
assembled
his
apathetic
and
somewhat
drowsy
auditor
the
young
duke
immediately
on
observing
the
approach
of
helen
grahame
with
a
slight
excuse
to
his
host
emancipated
himself
from
the
dull
topic
droned
into
his
ears
and
advanced
hastily
to
meet
her
almost
at
the
same
moment
whelks
entered
the
apartment
with
a
printed
card
upon
a
silver
salver
it
was
an
elegant
production
the
typography
was
bold
and
in
effect
smudgy
and
the
general
smacked
rather
loudly
of
the
seven
press
it
was
dingy
too
and
nibbled
at
the
corners
indicating
cogitation
on
the
part
of
the
person
whom
it
represented
the
pasteboard
having
been
used
unconsciously
instead
of
the
grimy
the
quick
eye
of
grahame
caught
sight
of
it
almost
the
instant
whelks
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
door
carrying
it
very
much
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
a
huge
slug
on
a
plate
which
he
was
seeking
the
earliest
opportunity
to
dispose
of
eyes
flashed
fire
what
could
the
idiot
mean
by
bringing
to
him
such
a
dun
drabby
bit
of
card
at
such
a
moment
he
glared
at
whelks
who
remained
unaffected
his
gaze
was
upon
the
soiled
article
he
carried
and
his
reflections
far
away
into
the
future
resting
upon
the
rosy
hour
when
liberated
from
flunkeydom
he
should
with
sarah
the
cook
unite
hands
and
savings
and
go
into
business
it
was
not
he
thought
with
such
hinfamous
fustian
smelling
as
that
which
rested
on
the
silver
salver
as
though
it
had
no
business
there
that
he
should
make
his
business
announcement
to
a
british
public
bursting
with
a
desire
to
deal
with
him
and
as
he
dreamed
thus
he
reached
his
master
grahame
and
margaret
claverhouse
both
with
an
astonishment
and
indignation
which
their
indomitable
pride
could
barely
repress
saw
upon
the
silver
salver
in
the
hands
of
whelks
the
offensively
dusky
shabby
card
and
if
glances
could
slay
remains
would
have
been
spread
over
the
magnificently
walls
he
was
however
as
we
have
said
all
unconscious
of
the
effect
he
was
creating
upon
the
members
of
the
household
and
he
reached
only
to
perceive
him
glowering
upon
him
like
a
tiger
inflamed
with
most
sanguinary
intentions
with
a
low
guttural
growl
he
was
about
to
make
known
to
whelks
the
nature
of
his
convictions
in
having
at
such
an
inopportune
moment
thrust
upon
him
so
foul
a
communication
when
his
eye
caught
sight
of
the
name
printed
according
to
the
trade
term
in
egyptian
of
chewkle
he
felt
as
if
some
one
had
suddenly
smote
him
on
the
head
with
a
club
and
he
broke
into
a
cold
sweat
this
man
was
in
possession
of
his
horrid
secret
he
was
in
his
power
at
any
time
he
could
blazon
forth
to
the
world
that
a
grahame
the
proudest
of
a
proud
family
had
committed
a
base
act
of
forgery
he
was
now
amenable
to
the
law
of
transportation
liable
to
be
torn
from
his
present
high
position
and
compelled
to
work
and
toil
with
thieves
and
scoundrels
in
a
penal
colony
these
reflections
none
the
less
vivid
for
presenting
themselves
in
that
brilliantly
lighted
room
and
in
the
presence
of
guests
of
high
birth
made
his
face
grow
white
and
his
knees
tremble
he
whipped
up
the
card
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
hoping
that
it
had
escaped
the
eyes
of
all
but
himself
whelks
delivered
then
an
urgent
message
from
chewkle
and
grahame
said
in
a
low
tone
is
he
the
sir
returned
the
footman
with
a
nose
him
into
the
library
i
will
come
to
him
immediately
exclaimed
grahame
in
the
same
tone
as
before
whelks
bowed
and
departed
to
obey
the
instructions
he
had
received
and
then
to
discuss
with
sarah
the
nature
of
the
business
of
a
agent
as
he
styled
occupation
and
wherefore
it
should
as
it
appeared
to
him
that
it
most
certainly
did
obtain
so
great
an
influence
over
such
a
man
as
grahame
grahame
perceiving
that
helen
had
absorbed
the
attention
of
the
duke
and
lester
vane
glided
out
of
the
room
into
the
library
as
he
entered
it
he
became
conscious
of
a
strong
smell
of
the
weed
which
however
to
his
olfactory
nerves
had
not
scent
of
the
rose
and
he
saw
chewkle
with
part
of
a
truly
british
cheroot
in
his
hand
standing
near
to
the
lamp
upon
the
table
harassed
by
doubts
as
to
the
propriety
of
relighting
it
or
the
propriety
of
doing
nothing
of
the
sort
grahame
bowed
patronisingly
but
said
hastily
smoking
i
hope
chewkle
returned
chewkle
was
out
afore
i
came
in
but
i
thought
if
you
mind
you
know
indeed
i
do
mind
responded
grahame
quickly
and
then
added
most
fiercely
as
he
perceived
the
red
and
begrimed
face
of
his
visitor
his
dirty
collar
his
necktie
and
his
hair
disordered
all
indicating
the
frequent
quaffing
and
replenishment
of
glass
which
and
inebriate
tell
me
chewkle
to
what
circumstance
i
am
to
attribute
your
visit
at
to
me
a
most
inconvenient
time
sir
things
happens
without
particularly
caring
for
our
convenience
answered
chewkle
with
a
hiccup
which
left
a
strong
odour
of
some
beverage
not
green
tea
behind
it
would
all
like
things
to
fall
out
jest
as
we
would
wish
but
they
it
seems
as
if
the
more
you
wish
the
more
they
said
grahame
not
liking
this
preface
continued
chewkle
when
things
run
cross
we
must
if
we
wants
to
right
go
to
work
at
once
without
caring
about
convenience
at
least
my
sentiments
my
way
doing
very
proper
way
no
doubt
my
good
friend
exclaimed
grahame
growing
yet
more
anxious
pray
tell
me
what
a
very
orkurd
matter
as
things
stand
replied
chewkle
is
it
what
is
it
cried
grahame
feverishly
just
this
old
out
out
out
of
prison
gasped
grahame
clutching
at
a
chair
for
support
else
replied
chewkle
placing
his
hands
behind
him
and
rocking
himself
backwards
and
forwards
on
his
toes
and
heels
in
a
very
dangerous
fashion
for
one
in
his
state
escaped
inquired
grahame
his
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
their
sockets
such
luck
answered
chewkle
he
had
soon
been
nabbed
agen
and
taken
back
to
been
kept
closer
than
do
you
mean
speak
out
man
you
are
inflicting
upon
me
indescribable
torture
exclaimed
grahame
excitedly
he
is
he
dead
no
got
more
lives
than
a
cat
he
has
no
sir
out
of
quod
because
been
and
paid
all
the
the
money
echoed
grahame
incredulously
mag
of
it
sir
every
farthing
he
has
wiped
off
the
detainer
lodged
at
the
gate
him
and
he
is
free
to
roam
about
grahame
stood
as
if
he
ejaculated
like
one
in
a
dream
sir
all
the
same
for
that
i
saw
scathe
the
managing
clerk
to
your
solicitor
and
he
told
me
all
about
it
the
debts
and
costs
is
paid
and
wilton
is
out
the
money
has
been
paid
under
protest
sir
so
you
touch
a
penny
on
it
until
proved
your
right
to
it
by
a
scathe
says
he
think
anything
that
because
the
firm
holds
a
dockyment
which
wilton
has
signed
in
your
favour
as
put
him
out
court
slap
now
what
i
wants
to
know
is
this
is
the
dockyment
he
spoke
of
the
same
as
grahame
clutched
his
wrist
looked
around
him
with
trepidation
and
raised
his
finger
warningly
chewkle
hiccuped
again
and
lowered
his
tone
and
added
it
the
same
as
as
as
you
signed
for
him
grahame
drew
a
deep
breath
but
made
no
reply
chewkle
was
a
shrewd
reader
of
physiognomy
and
obtained
the
information
he
sought
from
the
distorted
workings
of
haggard
features
he
gave
vent
to
his
sensations
on
learning
what
he
sought
to
know
in
a
low
prolonged
whistle
is
wuss
than
i
took
them
to
be
he
murmured
then
he
addressed
grahame
do
you
think
he
asked
is
as
has
been
making
himself
so
very
hactive
in
getting
old
wilton
out
hotel
you
guess
why
that
little
imidge
who
dropped
in
so
unexpected
when
you
jest
finished
that
bit
writing
for
the
hobstinate
the
bench
god
gasped
grahame
assisted
wilton
the
money
i
believe
sir
and
is
going
to
stand
his
friend
in
the
law
case
observed
chewkle
emphatically
grahame
clasped
his
hands
and
paced
the
room
in
agitation
he
passed
his
feverish
fingers
convulsively
over
his
temples
is
to
be
done
what
is
to
be
done
he
cried
have
commenced
to
act
upon
that
accursed
document
i
thought
he
never
never
would
come
out
of
prison
but
would
die
there
and
urged
by
the
frightfully
pressing
nature
of
my
necessity
my
situation
in
connection
with
the
estates
to
which
i
lay
claim
i
lodged
the
deed
with
my
lawyer
and
ordered
him
to
proceed
upon
it
he
has
commenced
i
know
he
has
commenced
the
deed
is
registered
all
will
be
discovered
and
oh
my
god
what
will
ensue
for
life
to
a
dead
certainty
replied
chewkle
in
slow
emphatic
tones
be
called
upon
to
prove
the
signatur
you
do
that
then
course
a
forgery
well
who
did
it
you
got
to
show
how
you
come
by
it
you
do
that
and
then
be
found
guilty
and
sentenced
for
life
clear
i
chewkle
felt
himself
at
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
seized
by
the
throat
cried
grahame
froth
foaming
and
bubbling
from
his
mouth
was
your
hellish
counsel
but
for
your
infernal
suggestion
and
complicity
i
should
never
have
thought
of
it
but
you
shall
share
my
fate
my
fate
transportation
oh
horror
horror
my
house
my
family
i
i
death
death
chewkle
felt
the
cold
clammy
fingers
of
his
antagonist
loosen
and
as
the
last
words
died
on
his
lips
he
saw
him
stagger
back
and
before
he
could
catch
him
he
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
fit
first
impulse
was
to
call
for
help
but
instantly
it
flashed
across
his
mind
that
he
should
have
a
thousand
questions
to
answer
besides
being
regarded
with
looks
of
distrust
and
suspicion
he
had
no
wish
at
that
hour
and
in
the
rather
free
style
and
state
of
his
costume
to
have
to
encounter
the
family
to
explain
that
which
it
was
so
important
should
be
left
unexplained
and
he
proceeded
to
attempt
himself
to
play
the
part
of
a
medical
attendant
chewkle
was
stronger
than
he
looked
and
he
had
need
of
all
his
strength
to
pin
grahame
to
the
floor
during
the
violent
paroxysms
of
the
fit
by
which
he
had
been
seized
he
succeeded
by
dint
of
tremendous
exertion
in
overmastering
the
desperate
struggles
of
the
prostrate
man
and
when
they
had
ceased
he
loosened
his
neckcloth
obtained
some
water
from
a
bottle
upon
the
table
bathed
his
temples
and
lips
with
it
until
grahame
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
wildly
around
him
like
one
waking
up
out
of
some
dreadful
dream
after
a
few
incoherent
expressions
he
became
once
more
alive
to
his
position
he
walked
up
and
down
his
library
wringing
his
hands
and
displaying
the
greatest
possible
mental
anguish
suddenly
he
paused
before
chewkle
and
with
a
stern
countenance
he
said
blindly
following
your
counsel
i
have
placed
myself
in
a
situation
of
awful
peril
tell
me
what
must
be
done
to
avoid
the
dreadful
degradation
with
which
i
am
threatened
how
is
this
frightful
false
step
to
be
retrieved
by
going
on
sir
as
if
gone
stark
staring
mad
answered
chewkle
rather
brusquely
a
good
deal
at
stake
you
know
and
only
one
way
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
game
by
being
as
cool
as
hice
and
as
clear
about
the
you
must
be
slow
to
think
and
decide
but
prompt
to
hact
you
are
in
a
mess
pretty
certain
the
only
way
to
get
out
of
it
is
to
be
quite
calm
and
to
calculate
your
chances
carefully
to
say
not
a
word
to
nobody
but
them
you
must
employ
and
fight
it
out
to
the
last
hinch
for
this
advice
seemed
tolerably
sound
but
grahame
could
not
reflect
calmly
nor
calculate
coldly
he
could
do
nothing
but
have
shifting
visions
of
the
happy
time
of
youth
when
he
was
free
from
the
cares
and
responsibilities
of
life
and
of
the
grim
shadowy
future
lying
behind
a
curtain
of
black
and
obscure
vapour
they
were
mingled
in
one
picture
whirling
and
rioting
through
his
aching
brain
and
incapacitating
him
from
sitting
down
to
plan
a
scheme
by
which
he
might
escape
the
consequences
of
the
crime
he
had
committed
is
useless
he
said
at
length
impatiently
expect
from
me
in
my
present
excitement
any
suggestion
dictated
by
cool
reflection
my
brain
is
in
chaotic
confusion
it
is
racked
with
agony
i
feel
that
something
must
instantly
be
done
but
what
what
my
good
chewkle
can
not
you
devise
something
you
are
cooler
than
i
you
see
if
the
wust
comes
to
the
wust
sir
responded
chewkle
calculatingly
be
hit
so
hard
as
you
i
can
afford
to
be
cooler
now
my
notion
is
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
get
hold
of
that
jeuced
dockyment
and
when
got
hold
on
to
drop
it
quietly
into
the
good
thought
send
for
it
at
once
to
my
solicitor
be
at
the
hoffice
now
interposed
chewkle
must
let
me
manage
it
be
with
afore
nine
to
morrow
morning
so
as
to
bust
upon
afore
they
opens
their
letters
or
commences
looking
at
papers
which
have
been
served
on
in
different
causes
be
in
such
a
fluster
hurry
to
get
back
to
you
that
get
the
dockyment
out
of
instead
of
being
put
off
with
a
promise
to
look
it
out
and
send
it
by
a
clerk
we
wait
you
know
we
have
it
and
see
bring
it
back
with
me
all
best
of
friends
how
can
i
reward
you
said
grahame
clutching
at
hope
and
relief
from
the
scheme
proposed
said
chewkle
tenner
will
do
for
me
jest
now
i
greedy
though
i
am
short
of
grahame
was
here
made
to
understand
that
a
ten
pound
note
was
needed
he
drew
one
promptly
from
his
purse
and
gave
it
to
chewkle
who
instantly
transferred
it
to
his
badly
worn
portmonnaie
which
he
plunged
into
the
depths
of
his
pocket
must
write
a
note
a
strong
note
to
your
solicitor
sir
he
observed
when
the
money
was
stowed
away
him
to
give
to
the
deed
mention
my
name
immediately
on
the
receipt
of
your
note
dash
under
that
will
throw
him
off
his
guard
he
will
give
the
dockyment
to
me
bring
it
to
you
and
then
you
can
destroy
it
is
registered
and
that
will
afford
proof
that
there
was
such
a
document
suggested
grahame
nervously
that
there
was
perhaps
answered
chewkle
what
of
that
to
prove
on
a
thing
that
forthcoming
to
substantiate
a
charge
of
for
sake
to
substantiate
such
a
charge
upon
a
thing
as
exist
that
be
put
in
in
support
of
the
case
it
be
but
what
if
proceedings
have
already
commenced
and
my
lawyer
is
prepared
to
put
in
that
deed
to
bar
the
claim
they
will
make
he
what
if
he
has
this
very
day
for
i
urged
him
to
proceed
with
all
then
we
must
be
prepared
to
prove
that
it
it
his
i
want
more
in
this
affair
than
ourselves
but
we
be
beat
while
there
is
a
chance
of
winning
suppose
i
swears
i
saw
him
sign
the
deed
and
suppose
old
jukes
swears
saw
him
do
it
and
suppose
his
follerers
sudds
and
dirty
nutty
swears
they
stood
by
and
saw
it
signed
how
then
nothing
can
be
brought
against
us
to
invalidate
our
evidence
and
what
could
the
hother
side
do
then
old
wilton
will
swear
of
course
hard
and
fast
that
he
did
not
sign
but
what
then
you
appear
in
the
matter
you
commissioned
me
to
get
it
signed
and
i
brings
forard
three
respectable
men
who
swears
swears
mind
they
saw
him
sign
it
be
believed
then
he
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
these
men
will
be
difficult
to
get
but
got
their
price
sir
and
are
to
be
all
these
remarks
and
suggestions
rascally
as
they
were
afforded
comfort
to
grahame
they
conveyed
to
him
a
glimmering
of
hope
that
the
difficulty
after
all
was
not
so
desperate
as
he
had
presumed
it
to
be
he
recoiled
at
the
notion
of
having
to
work
with
such
dirty
instruments
when
however
did
dishonesty
and
crime
ever
work
with
other
tools
but
he
did
not
recoil
at
the
work
itself
to
obtain
a
vast
advantage
at
the
price
of
the
misery
and
destruction
of
another
would
not
have
occasioned
him
a
remorse
or
in
any
degree
have
ruffled
his
equanimity
or
serenity
but
to
accomplish
that
task
by
the
aid
of
a
small
knot
of
low
rascals
was
the
source
of
extreme
annoyance
and
vexation
to
him
still
if
the
object
could
not
be
obtained
without
such
assistance
he
elected
to
employ
it
rather
than
forego
his
purpose
they
were
the
means
to
the
end
at
which
he
sought
to
arrive
disagreeable
enough
but
necessary
to
the
result
and
as
such
accepted
the
alternative
of
stoutly
maintaining
the
forged
signature
of
wilton
to
be
genuine
had
not
struck
him
the
suggestion
was
a
valuable
one
and
he
resolved
to
treasure
it
up
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
own
word
would
have
weight
in
a
court
of
justice
from
the
high
position
which
he
held
in
society
and
if
he
repudiated
having
had
anything
to
do
with
the
signature
or
of
having
been
present
when
it
was
being
signed
he
would
in
all
probability
be
believed
not
alone
because
it
would
seem
the
natural
course
for
him
wanting
the
signature
to
have
pursued
to
obtain
it
but
because
it
would
be
considered
incredible
that
he
had
descended
to
any
unworthy
artifice
or
to
crime
even
to
have
possessed
himself
of
it
its
return
to
his
own
possession
was
however
of
the
first
importance
its
destruction
would
raise
another
question
to
be
settled
hereafter
so
he
sat
down
and
penned
the
letter
to
his
solicitor
the
outlines
of
which
chewkle
had
supplied
as
he
completed
it
and
inclosed
it
in
an
envelope
he
said
to
chewkle
am
disturbed
to
learn
that
gomer
has
interested
himself
in
favour
that
fact
tells
rather
against
my
interests
he
is
a
singular
man
is
sir
echoed
chewkle
as
yallar
as
a
canary
everywhere
at
once
and
people
says
as
rich
as
though
why
should
be
called
rich
i
never
could
understand
unless
it
is
they
grows
in
profusion
you
get
at
six
bunches
a
is
a
very
extraordinary
man
said
grahame
musingly
very
extraordinary
man
enormously
wealthy
i
fear
the
man
i
fear
him
i
know
why
but
i
feel
terrified
in
his
presence
and
i
shudder
when
i
think
of
is
orful
hugly
and
that
is
the
truth
observed
chewkle
emphatically
adding
talk
about
him
sir
or
if
you
find
him
at
your
elber
be
surprised
to
see
him
walk
out
the
dark
at
the
end
of
the
room
exclaimed
grahame
with
a
slight
shudder
as
chewkle
jerked
his
thumb
over
his
left
shoulder
to
the
part
of
the
room
then
in
shadow
to
confess
the
truth
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
though
he
might
have
been
appalled
to
have
seen
the
apparition
of
nathan
gomer
in
the
spot
pointed
out
but
he
would
not
appear
to
acknowledge
so
much
to
chewkle
he
finished
the
superscription
of
the
note
and
handed
it
to
his
agent
saying
will
deliver
this
to
the
principal
of
the
firm
and
i
presume
i
may
expect
you
here
about
ten
tomorrow
morning
will
all
depend
upon
what
time
the
principal
comes
to
business
in
the
morning
sir
answered
chewkle
i
shall
be
there
afore
the
postman
and
have
the
deed
safe
enough
depend
on
course
it
was
this
business
alone
that
induced
you
to
come
here
inquired
grahame
almost
fearing
to
ask
in
case
there
might
be
further
unpleasant
communications
for
him
to
receive
else
sir
returned
chewkle
although
the
bank
note
was
the
principal
occasion
of
his
visit
i
learned
the
news
about
wilton
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
lose
no
time
in
letting
you
know
knowing
what
i
knowed
you
yes
yes
quite
right
you
did
quite
right
observed
grahame
hastily
me
see
you
with
the
deed
as
early
as
you
can
in
the
morning
good
night
grahame
rang
for
whelks
as
he
spoke
and
was
promptly
answered
by
the
immediate
appearance
of
his
man
who
had
applied
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
with
most
persevering
zeal
in
the
hope
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
audiences
with
his
proud
and
haughty
master
but
he
had
caught
nothing
but
the
which
subsequently
took
him
for
a
walk
up
and
down
his
bedroom
all
night
to
the
in
the
morning
afterwards
to
covent
garden
market
for
poppy
heads
and
subsequently
it
treated
itself
to
scorching
flannel
blistering
fermentations
and
applications
of
hot
and
cold
vinegar
until
whelks
was
nearly
pickled
on
the
disappearance
of
his
servant
and
chewkle
grahame
returned
to
his
guests
with
a
smiling
face
and
perfect
serenity
of
manner
although
every
one
in
the
room
noticed
his
haggard
aspect
and
the
ghastly
whiteness
of
his
face
as
he
made
no
complaint
they
were
too
well
bred
to
make
any
remark
and
exerting
himself
to
please
his
pallid
anxiousness
passed
without
further
observation
in
the
meanwhile
chewkle
followed
whelks
down
stairs
the
first
twinges
of
pain
were
introducing
themselves
to
notice
a
sensation
as
if
he
was
being
repeatedly
stabbed
in
the
ear
with
a
bradawl
was
the
first
intimation
he
had
of
something
unpleasant
coming
on
he
had
a
dim
notion
at
the
same
time
that
chewkle
was
addressing
him
as
but
the
lunges
with
the
figurative
were
so
brisk
when
they
once
commenced
that
he
was
plunged
into
the
wildest
confusion
being
for
the
moment
uncertain
whether
he
was
descending
to
the
mat
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
upon
his
locks
or
upon
his
tight
patent
pumps
chewkle
on
reaching
the
hall
however
made
him
understand
that
he
was
anxious
to
get
change
for
a
note
and
wished
to
know
where
he
could
achieve
it
whelks
who
was
desirous
of
holding
a
little
conversation
with
him
in
hopes
to
worm
something
out
of
him
explanatory
of
the
strange
and
anomalous
influence
he
evidently
possessed
with
the
head
of
the
household
offered
to
accommodate
him
having
he
said
he
believed
as
much
gold
in
his
purse
he
produced
it
and
displayed
to
the
greedy
eyes
of
chewkle
some
eighteen
or
twenty
sovereigns
as
whelks
counted
out
the
gold
a
storm
of
stabs
set
in
on
the
inner
portion
of
his
ear
so
that
he
grew
embarrassed
and
handed
a
number
of
sovereigns
to
chewkle
saying
as
his
eyes
overran
with
water
if
they
are
right
ow
ow
ow
the
dreadfullest
chewkle
counted
eleven
sovereigns
and
said
the
amount
was
quite
right
he
handed
the
note
to
whelks
and
thrust
the
sovereigns
into
his
pocket
was
to
say
to
you
sir
commenced
whelks
i
should
like
to
have
a
chat
with
you
if
ow
ow
ow
i
never
wheugh
oh
my
thing
said
chewkle
anxious
to
get
off
with
the
extra
sovereign
should
it
it
hout
echoed
whelks
my
hear
sir
ow
ow
ow
yes
responded
chewkle
inattentive
to
everything
but
getting
away
it
hout
by
all
means
get
it
done
for
a
bob
good
night
good
he
darted
through
the
doorway
as
the
porter
threw
open
the
door
to
admit
a
friend
of
his
own
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
his
home
he
lay
awake
after
getting
to
bed
for
some
time
busily
plotting
and
before
he
dropped
asleep
he
made
up
his
mind
how
he
would
act
by
eight
in
the
morning
he
appeared
before
the
door
of
the
offices
of
solicitors
he
knocked
and
the
laundress
who
was
setting
the
office
rights
admitted
him
he
pretended
to
be
surprised
that
no
clerk
was
there
but
on
his
stating
that
he
had
been
sent
upon
business
of
the
utmost
importance
by
a
client
of
the
firm
and
that
he
must
not
go
back
without
an
answer
the
woman
accommodated
him
with
a
seat
he
sat
motionless
but
watched
her
movements
closely
he
observed
her
enter
an
inner
apartment
the
consulting
room
of
the
principal
she
remained
in
there
some
little
time
and
when
she
returned
he
engaged
her
in
conversation
in
a
chatty
affable
familiar
way
silently
observing
at
the
same
time
that
she
placed
the
key
of
the
inner
apartment
in
a
particular
spot
presently
she
was
summoned
to
make
the
breakfast
of
one
of
clients
on
another
floor
and
telling
chewkle
that
the
clerk
would
shortly
arrive
she
left
him
alone
he
watched
her
through
the
keyhole
ascend
the
stairs
then
he
heard
a
door
above
bang
and
her
foot
reverberating
overhead
with
the
greatest
possible
quickness
he
made
for
the
spot
where
the
key
was
placed
and
securing
it
unlocked
the
door
of
the
inner
apartment
and
glided
into
the
room
he
gazed
sharply
around
at
the
boxes
on
the
shelves
and
upon
one
japanned
large
and
square
he
saw
printed
in
white
letters
the
name
of
grahame
and
beneath
it
the
date
of
the
year
he
made
for
it
and
opened
it
noiselessly
it
was
three
parts
full
of
papers
upon
the
very
top
was
the
deed
for
which
he
had
come
thither
he
recognised
the
endorsement
but
he
opened
it
and
at
the
bottom
saw
signature
as
grahame
had
written
it
the
sight
of
the
name
was
sufficient
he
carefully
closed
the
box
retreated
from
the
room
replaced
the
key
where
he
had
taken
it
from
put
the
deed
beneath
his
waistcoat
and
then
buttoned
his
coat
over
that
up
to
his
chin
he
reseated
himself
in
pretty
much
the
same
position
as
that
he
had
taken
when
the
laundress
left
him
and
upon
his
face
he
wore
a
blank
expression
leaving
it
a
debateable
point
whether
he
was
more
stupid
than
innocent
the
clock
of
a
neighbouring
church
struck
nine
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
the
door
opened
and
a
young
man
about
two
and
twenty
entered
he
started
on
seeing
chewkle
and
looked
as
disconcerted
as
a
man
who
comes
suddenly
upon
a
creditor
whom
he
can
not
pay
the
said
creditor
being
inexorable
and
rapacious
and
money
his
only
pacificator
if
such
were
the
feelings
his
apprehensions
were
relieved
by
chewkle
stating
the
object
of
his
visit
be
here
till
ten
replied
the
clerk
open
his
letters
and
if
i
did
i
dare
give
up
any
papers
you
must
wait
till
he
he
gave
chewkle
back
the
letter
and
told
him
to
take
his
seat
again
which
chewkle
did
about
nine
chewkle
said
suddenly
that
he
wanted
to
make
a
call
at
no
great
distance
off
and
he
thought
he
might
as
well
go
on
that
business
as
sit
there
doing
nothing
until
ten
by
which
hour
he
could
certainly
be
again
at
the
office
the
clerk
said
he
thought
so
too
so
chewkle
went
leisurely
away
no
sooner
out
of
sight
of
the
office
than
he
jumped
into
a
cab
and
drove
to
his
own
house
and
in
a
secret
place
deposited
in
an
iron
chest
with
other
articles
of
value
the
deed
he
had
purloined
he
locked
the
chest
safely
and
once
more
made
his
way
to
the
street
where
he
hired
another
cab
rattled
back
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
office
discharged
it
and
entered
the
office
at
three
minutes
to
ten
not
here
yet
said
the
clerk
chewkle
obeyed
looking
vacant
laughing
stupidly
when
the
eye
of
the
clerk
caught
his
a
pump
thought
the
young
man
chewkle
felt
slightly
uneasy
for
fear
the
managing
clerk
scathe
should
make
his
appearance
and
recognise
him
but
he
calculated
he
was
engaged
at
westminster
in
a
cause
and
would
be
hunting
up
witnesses
before
he
made
his
appearance
at
the
office
as
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
principal
of
the
firm
entered
chewkle
rose
up
and
handed
him
the
letter
grahame
park
he
said
said
the
solicitor
with
a
smile
answer
be
seated
i
will
give
you
one
the
clerk
handed
to
his
principal
the
key
of
his
room
he
took
it
unlocked
the
door
and
passing
in
closed
it
after
him
chewkle
sat
and
waited
for
the
as
if
he
was
engaged
counting
the
letters
in
the
printed
notices
of
sittings
in
term
stuck
up
over
the
fireplace
presently
a
bell
rang
and
the
clerk
entered
the
room
closing
the
door
after
him
chewkle
still
reading
the
printed
paper
some
time
elapsed
happened
wonder
muttered
chewkle
still
staring
at
the
printed
bill
by
and
by
the
clerk
made
his
appearance
and
said
o
chewkle
in
he
led
the
way
into
the
inner
apartment
and
chewkle
saw
the
solicitor
with
a
flushed
face
and
excited
countenance
going
through
the
papers
in
the
box
with
the
name
of
grahame
painted
upon
it
name
is
chewkle
i
believe
said
the
solicitor
as
chewkle
approached
him
is
my
name
and
no
other
sir
he
replied
you
were
sent
hither
for
a
deed
by
grahame
eh
inquired
the
lawyer
deed
sir
why
he
said
to
be
a
paper
packet
returned
chewkle
yes
do
you
know
what
the
paper
was
about
sir
no
why
grahame
is
so
anxious
to
have
it
sir
no
sir
very
odd
very
remarkable
scathe
must
have
got
it
or
put
it
somewhere
suggested
the
clerk
can
furnish
no
other
solution
of
the
mystery
answered
the
principal
in
the
same
tone
if
that
is
the
case
scathe
is
very
much
to
blame
and
will
not
fail
to
be
made
acquainted
with
my
opinion
to
that
then
raising
his
voice
he
addressed
chewkle
good
enough
to
tell
grahame
that
i
will
send
the
deed
up
to
him
by
one
of
my
told
me
to
say
sir
that
he
wait
for
that
so
i
was
to
bring
it
with
could
not
wait
for
what
do
you
mean
sir
i
he
thought
you
might
be
busy
and
would
put
off
sending
the
packet
to
him
until
it
suited
your
i
see
um
well
deliver
the
message
i
have
given
he
said
i
to
go
without
to
grahame
my
man
and
say
i
will
send
it
up
to
him
by
my
clerk
exclaimed
the
solicitor
speaking
under
increasing
irritation
with
marked
emphasis
go
back
without
it
sir
on
no
consideration
persisted
chewkle
assuming
a
dogged
manner
my
the
solicitor
looked
fiercely
at
him
and
raising
his
voice
said
have
it
i
say
you
have
it
it
is
not
at
this
moment
do
you
understand
chewkle
quite
understood
that
it
was
certainly
not
unless
some
one
picked
the
lock
of
his
iron
safe
but
he
appeared
not
to
comprehend
anything
except
that
he
was
ordered
not
to
return
without
a
paper
growled
the
solicitor
angrily
he
sat
down
and
penned
a
note
to
grahame
stating
that
his
managing
clerk
as
the
business
was
being
pushed
on
had
the
deed
under
his
charge
he
was
at
the
moment
down
at
westminster
engaged
upon
a
cause
but
that
on
his
return
the
deed
should
be
forwarded
to
grahame
folding
up
his
note
and
directing
it
he
gave
it
to
chewkle
saying
that
to
grahame
turning
sharply
to
his
clerk
he
added
crumpler
show
him
crumpler
caught
chewkle
by
the
coat
sleeve
drew
him
into
the
outer
office
and
pointed
significantly
to
way
chewkle
exhibited
his
teeth
no
mistaking
them
for
pearls
to
crumpler
and
obeyed
the
sign
he
descended
the
stairs
rapidly
and
moved
along
the
footway
of
the
street
quivering
in
the
throes
of
what
he
considered
an
immense
triumph
hincome
for
life
he
muttered
deed
will
be
as
good
as
a
to
me
i
can
bleed
grahame
of
jest
whatever
i
pleases
by
threatening
of
him
i
to
let
him
know
got
the
forged
but
i
shall
in
good
time
as
i
knows
where
it
is
and
i
can
keep
it
dark
or
blow
it
jest
whichever
i
likes
it
and
send
it
up

by
walker
i
they
little
thinks
i
nabbed
it
none
of
will
ever
dream
that
i
could
lay
a
to
one
about
that
i
as
he
offered
to
lay
these
very
long
odds
he
ran
up
against
nathan
gomer
the
visage
of
the
little
man
shone
like
burnished
gold
his
eyes
danced
and
sparkled
and
he
chuckled
as
if
animated
by
the
most
pleasurable
emotions
friend
chewkle
he
exclaimed
placing
his
cold
fishy
hand
upon
fevered
wrist
are
active
this
morning
full
of
business
away
from
home
to
a
office
then
hurrying
back
in
a
cab
to
your
charmingly
retired
abode
away
in
a
cab
back
to
the
solicitors
and
now
ha
ha
eh
be
sworn
to
in
the
park
with
communication
i
say
communication
he
he
brisk
fellow
sharp
fellow
smart
he
poked
chewkle
in
the
ribs
and
chewkle
felt
as
if
the
dent
his
finger
made
remained
and
would
continue
a
hole
for
the
rest
of
his
life
continued
nathan
am
so
partial
to
sharp
fellows
especially
when
they
move
about
so
nimbly
to
serve
others
without
a
thought
of
serving
themselves
eh
friend
chewkle
i
say
without
one
thought
of
doing
themselves
a
small
chewkle
tried
to
laugh
but
no
sound
issued
from
his
distended
jaws
he
felt
his
flesh
crawl
and
creep
over
his
bones
and
his
marrow
vibrate
his
scalp
seemed
to
have
the
and
needles
and
his
hair
to
rise
slowly
up
dust
and
all
threatening
to
tilt
his
hat
into
the
mud
nathan
grinned
at
him
like
a
hindoo
idol
nodded
and
diving
among
the
flowing
stream
of
persons
ceaselessly
passing
on
disappeared
chewkle
shuddered
and
drew
a
long
breath
believe
the
devil
hisself
he
groaned
and
slowly
now
doubtfully
pursued
his
way
to
abode
made
very
uneasy
by
the
conviction
that
the
secret
of
his
performance
was
not
exclusively
confined
to
himself
chapter
love
at
first
sight
i
pray
sir
tell
me
is
it
possible
that
love
should
of
a
sudden
take
such
hold
oh
tranio
till
i
found
it
to
be
true
i
never
thought
it
possible
or
likely
but
see
while
idly
i
stood
looking
on
i
found
the
effect
of
love
in
idleness
shakspere
when
hal
vivian
and
flora
wilton
summoned
by
nathan
gomer
rejoined
old
wilton
prior
to
his
departure
from
the
bench
they
found
him
at
the
gate
leading
into
the
or
cage
through
which
every
incomer
or
outgoer
must
pass
awaiting
them
he
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
both
flora
and
hal
to
have
become
another
being
he
was
yet
meanly
clad
his
face
was
still
furrowed
and
bore
the
lines
of
care
and
sorrow
and
his
hair
straggled
loosely
and
wildly
but
there
was
a
brilliancy
in
his
eye
recently
so
dim
there
was
a
hectic
flush
upon
his
cheek
of
late
wan
and
pallid
and
his
figure
some
few
hours
past
drooping
the
symbol
of
hopeless
wretchedness
was
now
erect
firm
and
that
of
a
gentleman
even
the
tone
of
his
voice
had
undergone
a
change
it
had
been
sharp
though
weak
and
querulous
it
was
now
round
and
clear
indicating
a
heart
purified
and
emancipated
from
the
destroying
influences
of
despair
his
manner
which
had
been
that
of
a
grateful
and
respectful
recipient
of
services
now
assumed
the
character
of
the
power
to
confer
them
not
haughtily
nor
patronisingly
but
gently
and
kindly
still
marked
by
conscious
elevation
of
position
the
golden
key
used
by
some
as
yet
unknown
good
angel
had
shot
back
the
bolts
of
the
prison
to
let
eustace
wilton
pass
into
the
free
world
beyond
the
gatekeepers
had
an
instinctive
respect
for
a
man
who
could
pay
two
thousand
pounds
after
so
short
a
detention
so
they
cast
away
their
brusque
sharp
extraofficial
impertinence
of
manner
and
obsequiously
congratulated
him
upon
his
early
departure
they
expressed
their
full
and
decided
conviction
that
he
would
not
quit
without
remembering
those
attached
to
the
establishment
because
as
the
spokesman
forcibly
rather
than
elegantly
observed
was
the
custom
gentlemen
as
was
gentlemen
to
act
as
sech
and
to
behave
wilton
had
not
forgotten
the
poor
box
and
in
the
elation
of
his
spirits
could
not
resist
the
appeal
thus
made
to
him
to
the
manifest
astonishment
of
hal
vivian
and
to
the
marvel
of
flora
he
took
from
his
purse
two
sovereigns
and
handed
them
to
the
gatekeeper
who
accepted
the
amount
with
a
smile
which
extended
to
the
visages
of
two
of
his
brother
officers
who
were
at
his
elbow
prepared
to
divide
the
gift
as
soon
as
back
was
turned
nathan
gomer
witnessed
the
act
with
undisguised
disgust
and
muttered
they
fatten
on
the
flesh
and
blood
of
the
destitute
and
the
he
took
wilton
by
the
arm
as
he
spoke
and
hurried
him
through
the
cage
to
the
entrance
where
a
cab
was
waiting
to
receive
the
party
here
nathan
gomer
after
a
brief
private
conference
with
wilton
took
his
leave
and
the
cab
departed
for
the
residence
of
harper
wilton
was
compelled
to
proceed
there
his
own
dwelling
was
now
a
heap
of
charred
and
blackened
ruins
but
he
had
no
intention
of
staying
beneath
the
roof
of
harper
one
hour
longer
than
was
necessary
he
was
grateful
in
his
acknowledgments
to
the
good
goldsmith
and
his
wife
once
more
he
also
assured
hal
that
the
obligation
he
had
conferred
upon
him
by
saving
flora
from
destruction
was
one
which
he
could
never
repay
and
that
he
should
consider
himself
bound
in
the
future
to
perform
for
him
any
service
within
his
power
when
called
upon
by
him
to
do
so
for
two
days
old
wilton
was
constantly
occupied
abroad
his
manner
was
peculiar
and
mysterious
he
volunteered
no
explanations
and
answered
questions
with
reserve
he
never
alluded
to
the
circumstances
of
his
sudden
liberation
from
prison
nor
was
even
flora
made
by
him
acquainted
with
the
means
by
which
it
had
been
effected
upon
the
evening
of
the
second
day
he
returned
to
residence
and
laconically
informed
the
old
goldsmith
that
he
had
been
successful
in
securing
a
furnished
house
he
proposed
therefore
at
once
to
remove
himself
and
his
daughter
thither
that
they
might
no
longer
prove
a
burden
to
those
who
had
so
unexpectedly
such
an
addition
made
to
their
numbers
but
who
had
played
the
part
of
samaritans
so
nobly
the
announcement
was
listened
to
with
regret
by
at
least
one
person
present
but
no
objection
could
be
interposed
and
before
the
hour
of
midnight
had
arrived
flora
found
herself
wooing
the
coy
embraces
of
slumber
upon
a
down
bed
in
an
elegantly
furnished
one
of
a
suite
in
a
handsome
villa
mansion
in
the
park
she
had
parted
with
hal
quietly
neither
had
displayed
emotion
what
they
felt
was
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
all
present
their
words
were
few
but
each
seemed
to
wish
the
other
to
understand
that
lightly
to
forget
would
not
be
possible
it
was
some
compensation
to
hal
for
the
rude
shattering
of
the
ideal
fabric
he
had
so
blissfully
reared
to
receive
from
wilton
the
assurance
that
the
doors
of
his
house
would
ever
be
open
to
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
enter
whenever
he
pleased
and
that
he
might
in
fact
view
it
as
a
second
home
saviour
of
my
child
deserves
no
less
at
my
hands
he
added
when
hal
vivian
encountered
poor
lotte
clinton
he
had
therefore
no
hesitation
in
conveying
her
direct
to
the
new
residence
of
flora
wilton
flora
had
frequently
inquired
after
her
and
had
hoped
that
she
would
visit
her
for
she
had
not
forgotten
her
display
of
womanly
sympathy
when
she
was
distracted
by
a
combination
of
troubles
and
she
was
anxious
to
express
her
grateful
sense
of
kindheartedness
and
her
hope
that
some
day
she
might
be
able
to
repay
it
but
lotte
came
not
flora
imagined
that
her
brother
had
conveyed
her
to
some
place
of
residence
near
his
own
and
though
at
times
uneasy
thoughts
would
rise
and
suggest
that
she
might
have
escaped
the
horrors
of
the
burning
house
only
to
fall
into
new
dangers
still
she
hoped
that
she
should
see
her
again
smiling
and
cheerful
as
she
had
been
and
in
a
better
position
than
ever
hal
knew
this
and
decided
that
he
could
not
do
better
than
conduct
lotte
to
her
when
he
found
her
in
a
condition
of
despair
and
destitution
which
had
given
up
all
other
hope
of
relief
but
what
would
afford
as
the
cab
pursued
its
way
lotte
sat
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
weeping
she
wished
to
restrain
the
violence
of
her
emotions
to
attain
a
calmness
which
would
enable
her
to
speak
to
hal
with
some
degree
of
steadiness
but
in
vain
she
had
not
power
to
resist
the
torrent
the
floodgates
were
borne
away
and
she
could
only
lean
in
the
corner
of
the
vehicle
and
let
her
tears
pursue
their
impetuous
course
it
was
not
that
new
hopes
were
awakened
or
that
she
doubted
the
result
of
her
meeting
with
hal
she
knew
instinctively
it
would
lift
her
for
the
moment
out
of
her
despairing
destitution
but
it
still
rendered
her
future
shadowy
and
undefined
she
must
accept
pecuniary
obligations
from
him
she
shrank
from
them
needlessly
enough
but
her
fears
had
by
reflection
been
aroused
and
her
desperate
situation
had
magnified
them
into
unnatural
proportions
after
all
her
thoughts
were
of
a
very
uncertain
character
she
was
too
prostrated
to
think
much
she
had
with
a
mind
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
frenzy
stood
upon
the
verge
of
eternity
a
moment
more
and
she
had
precipitated
herself
into
the
obscure
and
misty
regions
of
that
unmapped
land
she
had
been
suddenly
held
back
to
renew
the
battle
of
life
upon
what
terms
was
hidden
from
her
but
the
revulsion
of
feeling
occasioned
by
this
recall
overmastered
all
faculties
but
that
of
weeping
and
left
her
as
we
have
stated
absorbed
in
tears
hal
sought
not
to
check
them
it
would
be
time
enough
to
speak
to
her
when
the
paroxysm
had
ceased
or
at
least
abated
somewhat
of
its
violence
he
hoped
then
for
the
return
of
better
feelings
not
that
he
intended
to
read
her
any
homily
upon
the
folly
and
the
wickedness
of
the
crime
into
the
commission
of
which
she
was
hurrying
because
he
believed
that
more
powerful
suggestions
than
any
he
could
offer
would
present
themselves
to
her
and
because
also
from
what
little
he
knew
of
her
nature
he
felt
fully
convinced
that
the
incitement
to
leap
out
of
life
into
the
dread
unknown
must
have
been
of
a
description
exceeding
the
sustaining
powers
of
others
gifted
even
with
a
higher
capacity
of
endurance
than
she
possessed
so
for
a
considerable
distance
they
rode
on
in
silence
her
sobs
had
grown
gradually
wider
in
the
interval
of
their
inspirations
and
ultimately
the
painful
sound
ceased
entirely
having
satisfied
himself
that
she
had
not
fainted
he
made
a
few
commonplace
observations
yet
not
altogether
unconnected
with
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
fallen
in
with
her
at
a
moment
of
such
intense
importance
in
order
to
prove
to
her
that
it
was
a
direct
interposition
of
providence
in
her
behalf
a
faint
monosyllable
uttered
now
and
then
was
all
she
returned
in
reply
for
she
felt
her
helpless
position
most
acutely
however
grateful
she
ought
to
have
been
for
her
rescue
from
an
attempt
to
commit
and
she
was
glad
when
the
cab
stopped
at
the
address
which
hal
had
given
to
the
driver
having
dismissed
the
vehicle
hal
led
lotte
up
the
gravelled
path
leading
to
the
door
of
new
residence
and
gave
a
summons
at
the
door
with
the
hand
of
one
who
felt
he
had
a
right
of
in
that
house
at
any
time
he
was
ushered
into
the
hall
promptly
it
was
his
first
visit
a
glance
told
him
the
style
in
which
wilton
so
recently
a
humble
to
his
establishment
had
commenced
to
live
the
who
opened
the
door
turned
his
inquiring
eyes
upon
the
new
comers
uncertain
whether
to
be
civil
or
calmly
insulting
to
them
he
had
yet
to
learn
the
description
of
visitors
whom
his
new
master
delighted
to
honour
hal
sensitive
and
restive
under
suspicion
as
to
his
status
in
society
drew
a
card
from
his
and
in
a
very
decided
tone
which
sounded
like
command
said
as
he
handed
the
small
piece
of
thin
pasteboard
to
him
will
please
to
say
that
i
am
desirous
of
seeing
miss
wilton
and
that
i
shall
esteem
it
a
favour
if
she
will
grant
me
an
interview
at
once
and
the
instantly
summoned
a
dressed
in
a
livery
of
deep
violet
hue
and
gave
him
the
card
and
the
message
scarcely
a
minute
elapsed
ere
the
man
reappeared
and
bade
him
follow
him
hal
pressed
the
arm
of
lotte
as
he
felt
her
cower
by
his
side
overwhelmed
by
what
her
dim
eyes
beheld
and
he
led
her
gently
in
the
direction
the
man
had
taken
she
tottered
and
could
hardly
find
strength
to
walk
courage
lotte
my
good
girl
my
life
for
it
you
will
be
tenderly
received
he
whispered
gently
to
her
oh
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
those
encouraging
words
but
all
this
grandeur
she
could
have
met
flora
readily
if
she
were
as
she
had
until
now
known
her
but
to
come
before
her
so
hapless
a
wretch
as
she
deemed
herself
to
be
in
the
midst
of
all
this
luxury
and
wealth
was
only
a
new
trial
she
said
not
a
word
but
she
feared
her
reception
to
be
pitied
and
to
be
patronised
now
would
be
to
slay
her
the
man
ushered
them
into
a
small
but
elegantly
furnished
apartment
a
lamp
burned
brightly
upon
the
table
near
to
it
stood
flora
wilton
dressed
as
hal
had
never
seen
her
before
her
attire
was
such
as
a
princess
might
have
worn
and
with
pride
for
it
was
costly
in
its
value
and
in
its
taste
unimpeachable
as
the
light
fell
full
upon
her
face
and
form
hal
turned
faint
flora
smiled
sweetly
and
said
in
a
tone
musical
half
joyous
yet
half
reproachful
am
so
glad
to
see
you
hal
mr
vivian
i
i
thought
you
would
have
come
before
i
quite
ex
she
paused
for
she
suddenly
perceived
lotte
who
had
tremblingly
shrunk
behind
hal
wishing
from
the
depths
of
her
aching
heart
she
had
never
never
been
induced
to
come
here
hal
followed
the
direction
of
her
eyes
and
he
said
hastily
am
grateful
miss
wilton
for
your
kind
reception
but
at
least
i
do
not
claim
it
for
myself
i
have
one
poor
sorrowful
heart
here
with
me
for
whom
i
entreat
your
warm
interest
she
needs
it
to
ensure
your
sympathy
i
may
only
suggest
that
lotte
not
a
word
more
flora
was
at
the
side
of
lotte
in
an
instant
with
her
arm
round
her
waist
the
bright
rays
of
the
lamp
fell
upon
the
thin
white
wasted
features
of
the
poor
creature
flora
had
last
seen
her
a
roundfaced
pretty
lively
laughing
girl
what
a
dreadful
change
did
she
now
behold
she
burst
into
tears
she
twined
her
arms
about
shoulders
she
laid
her
cold
wan
face
upon
her
own
warm
bosom
lotte
lotte
dear
dear
lotte
what
has
happened
she
murmured
through
her
streaming
tears
are
are
you
so
dreadfully
changed
confide
in
me
as
in
a
sister
pray
pray
do
oh
my
heart
aches
to
see
you
thus
indeed
lotte
it
does
in
very
truth
it
why
had
flora
been
grand
had
she
played
the
lady
had
she
offered
to
take
the
case
presented
to
her
by
hal
at
an
early
moment
and
promised
to
do
something
lotte
might
have
been
pierced
to
the
heart
but
she
would
then
have
stood
up
bravely
and
haughtily
have
declined
the
intended
favour
though
she
consigned
herself
to
destitution
by
the
act
but
to
be
caught
thus
to
heart
to
be
embraced
to
have
poured
into
her
ears
expressions
of
tender
sympathy
to
feel
upon
her
cheeks
the
tears
of
human
pity
which
had
the
essence
of
divine
pity
to
feel
to
be
convinced
that
the
tender
commiseration
which
flora
though
unknowing
the
circumstances
had
exhibited
for
her
was
sincere
it
was
all
all
more
than
she
could
bear
she
sank
at
feet
embraced
her
knees
tried
to
ejaculate
her
gratefulness
tried
to
tell
that
now
indeed
she
felt
herself
lifted
out
of
despair
and
degradation
but
exhausted
nature
refused
to
do
more
and
she
fell
back
upon
the
carpet
in
a
swoon
hal
who
had
walked
to
the
end
of
the
apartment
half
choked
in
his
efforts
to
repress
the
tears
which
would
flow
into
his
eyes
now
at
a
sudden
cry
from
the
lips
of
flora
rushed
forward
and
raised
lotte
from
the
ground
while
flora
rang
the
bell
which
brought
into
the
apartment
her
maid
a
young
but
strong
good
looking
and
seemingly
girl
flora
beckoned
to
her
me
to
bear
this
young
lady
into
my
she
said
has
fainted
be
very
gentle
and
tender
in
your
movements
mercy
for
she
is
very
dear
young
lady
said
the
girl
gazing
upon
ghastly
features
do
look
bad
she
received
her
from
custody
and
lifting
her
up
in
her
arms
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
she
bore
her
tenderly
to
chamber
and
laid
her
gently
on
the
bed
as
flora
was
following
hal
detained
her
and
in
a
few
brief
words
acquainted
her
with
the
circumstances
which
had
attended
his
meeting
with
lotte
he
left
her
to
obtain
the
rest
from
her
own
surmises
or
from
any
communications
lotte
might
make
and
he
took
the
opportunity
of
bidding
her
farewell
promising
that
he
would
pay
a
more
formal
visit
and
make
a
more
protracted
stay
within
a
few
days
not
fail
said
flora
with
some
earnestness
my
father
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
here
he
has
made
many
inquiries
respecting
you
and
i
i
do
hope
you
will
come
she
need
have
been
under
no
apprehension
that
he
would
stay
away
her
beauty
was
a
magnet
which
would
have
drawn
visitors
loving
her
far
less
passionately
than
he
he
made
his
way
home
defiantly
challenging
the
ideal
to
produce
such
exquisite
and
perfect
loveliness
as
the
real
had
that
night
presented
to
him
flora
hurried
to
her
chamber
where
poor
lotte
yet
lay
senseless
she
was
too
ill
that
night
to
leave
her
bed
she
was
placed
under
the
careful
skill
of
an
eminent
physician
who
at
once
declared
her
illness
to
be
occasioned
solely
by
mental
distress
and
treated
her
accordingly
we
may
here
mention
that
bantom
grew
very
uneasy
when
nine
came
and
lotte
had
not
come
back
and
by
ten
bantom
was
dispatched
in
search
of
her
with
strong
injunctions
not
to
go
about
his
task
as
if
he
was
anxious
to
give
her
into
the
custody
of
the
police
on
a
charge
of
petty
larceny
or
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
induce
persons
to
believe
that
he
was
on
the
prowl
with
the
view
of
dishonestly
possessing
himself
of
property
which
but
to
proceed
at
once
and
make
his
inquiries
in
a
clear
and
straightforward
manner
bantom
fortunately
possessed
the
address
of
the
knave
for
whom
lotte
had
worked
without
obtaining
her
earnings
and
he
went
there
direct
he
quickly
found
that
the
place
was
shut
up
and
that
the
proprietor
had
been
done
out
of
her
wages
he
said
to
himself
is
afeard
to
come
back
a
hiding
of
herself
somewheres
i
must
find
her
else
be
and
somethen
foolish
keep
that
gal
the
same
as
i
would
one
of
my
own
kids
rather
than
any
harm
should
come
to
her
that
i
would
sure
she
is
honest
and
ah
blessed
if
ever
i
saw
anyone
woman
or
man
work
so
hard
as
she
did
over
them
wimmen
will
have
without
a
farden
how
many
of
their
own
blessed
sort
they
kills
in
the
on
i
wish
i
could
get
hold
that
cove
that
got
the
poor
gal
to
do
all
that
work
and
then
hooked
it
scrag
him
make
a
korps
on
him
or
my
name
jem
the
chances
are
that
if
bantom
had
fallen
in
with
him
at
the
moment
he
would
have
kept
his
word
or
at
least
have
so
severely
trounced
him
that
his
most
intimate
friends
would
for
a
lengthened
period
have
been
unable
to
recognise
him
bantom
was
checked
at
the
very
place
where
he
expected
to
obtain
information
none
of
the
persons
living
near
to
the
house
where
lotte
had
called
for
her
money
had
seen
her
and
he
had
to
start
off
to
find
a
clue
to
her
as
best
he
could
he
inquired
at
at
hospitals
and
at
but
without
gaining
any
tidings
of
her
and
the
night
had
worn
away
when
he
returned
to
report
his
ill
success
bantom
wrung
her
hands
poor
young
lonesome
thing
drownded
herself
she
cried
along
the
cussed
money
she
told
me
she
owed
us
she
said
she
would
she
said
she
poor
bantom
sobbed
bitterly
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
bantom
looked
upon
lotte
very
much
as
he
would
upon
a
dog
which
he
had
picked
up
brought
home
found
to
possess
good
qualities
and
had
grown
into
a
pet
he
had
found
and
brought
lotte
home
and
he
felt
a
personal
interest
in
her
which
could
not
have
been
created
in
his
breast
under
any
other
circumstances
when
therefore
he
heard
his
surmise
he
seized
his
hat
put
it
on
his
head
and
tired
as
he
was
prepared
to
sally
forth
again
he
said
in
a
husky
tone
likes
to
know
the
wust
i
does
i
purfers
it
off
to
the
river
i
am
to
show
you
wrong
keep
up
your
pluck
old
gal
be
back
as
quick
as
ever
i
he
went
traversed
both
sides
of
the
river
between
london
and
westminster
bridges
and
crawled
home
in
the
morning
exhausted
as
the
clock
was
striking
seven
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
despondent
as
ever
man
in
this
world
was
and
said
told
you
keziah
you
wus
wrong
nobody
has
drownded
themselves
this
blessed
night
been
both
sides
of
the
river
from
to
a
loud
knock
at
this
instant
was
given
at
the
and
bantom
came
into
collision
at
the
lock
and
both
pulled
at
it
together
it
was
not
lotte
who
had
knocked
and
their
countenances
fell
for
with
hearts
beating
high
with
hope
they
had
fully
persuaded
themselves
she
had
come
at
last
a
footman
in
violet
livery
met
their
gaze
instead
he
looked
at
husband
and
wife
and
with
the
air
and
manner
of
a
cabinet
minister
in
his
court
dress
he
said
inquiringly
me
exclaimed
husband
and
wife
together
the
footman
produced
a
letter
and
handed
it
to
bantom
if
all
right
he
said
bantom
could
read
but
not
with
ease
and
rapidity
he
could
write
too
but
his
hand
was
bold
and
slightly
irregular
he
was
very
nervous
this
morning
and
the
handwriting
of
the
superscription
was
so
delicate
a
fairy
might
have
penned
it
he
looked
at
his
wife
opened
the
envelope
and
took
out
a
sheet
of
delicate
note
paper
which
he
unclosed
it
contained
a
bank
of
england
note
which
with
trembling
fingers
bantom
spread
wide
note
my
goodness
he
exclaimed
with
astonishment
he
mechanically
handed
the
paper
which
had
contained
the
note
to
the
footman
looks
like
a
good
scholard
he
observed
read
that
pretty
writing
for
the
footman
with
a
supercilious
smile
not
sorry
to
be
put
in
possession
of
the
contents
of
the
note
read
asfollows
sends
her
love
to
and
bantom
and
begs
them
to
forgive
her
for
any
uneasiness
she
may
have
occasioned
them
she
desires
to
assure
them
that
though
ill
she
is
quite
burst
from
lips
sounds
composed
of
hysterical
laughter
and
a
genuine
cry
although
the
latter
was
the
offspring
of
joy
alone
bantom
flung
her
apron
over
her
head
that
the
tears
she
shed
might
not
be
visible
to
the
strange
young
man
in
violet
she
had
small
need
to
be
ashamed
of
the
honest
tears
of
happiness
at
the
communication
thus
received
of
safety
the
footman
was
rather
indignant
at
this
interruption
he
saw
nothing
as
he
said
to
at
and
he
requested
them
to
be
quiet
while
he
read
the
contents
of
the
note
they
obeyed
him
an
occasional
sigh
and
sniff
from
bantom
being
the
only
further
interruption
the
note
went
on
to
say
that
lotte
would
see
them
shortly
but
in
part
payment
of
what
she
was
indebted
to
them
she
inclosed
the
note
hoping
they
would
believe
she
would
never
forget
their
kindness
to
her
there
was
joy
in
house
that
day
his
shop
was
better
stocked
than
usual
and
many
of
the
very
poor
were
allowed
to
have
credit
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
bantom
could
not
have
afforded
lotte
on
being
recovered
from
her
swoon
though
very
feeble
and
under
strong
injunctions
not
to
speak
could
not
rest
until
she
had
unfolded
her
true
condition
to
flora
and
begged
her
to
let
the
bantoms
at
least
know
that
she
was
safe
that
her
mysterious
absence
as
nearly
as
possible
might
be
accounted
for
we
have
seen
in
what
manner
flora
complied
with
her
wish
a
few
days
and
the
tender
care
and
kindness
of
flora
wilton
were
rewarded
by
the
rapidly
returning
strength
of
lotte
she
was
able
to
leave
her
room
and
to
walk
in
the
garden
with
flora
these
walks
in
the
soft
fresh
air
did
much
to
revive
her
the
garden
was
so
prettily
laid
out
the
flowers
so
profuse
and
beautiful
she
loved
flowers
passionately
that
it
afforded
her
considerable
pleasure
to
stroll
there
in
company
with
her
kind
friend
besides
while
most
grateful
for
the
affectionate
sympathy
and
generosity
of
flora
she
had
no
notion
of
remaining
dependant
she
had
far
too
brave
a
spirit
for
that
and
she
felt
that
these
daily
walks
among
the
flowers
in
the
bright
clear
air
were
bringing
back
to
her
health
and
strength
to
renew
the
labour
of
breadwinning
one
lovely
morning
while
strolling
with
flora
she
said
to
her
lightly
garden
adjoining
this
appears
to
be
extremely
beautiful
although
it
is
hardly
possible
to
get
a
glimpse
at
flora
smiled
have
discovered
already
the
mysteries
of

from

they
pursued
a
winding
course
for
a
short
distance
and
were
stopped
by

the

lay
spread

turned
her
large
dark
eyes
upon
flora
it
was
impossible
not
to
acknowledge
the
extreme
loveliness
of
the
fair
young
face
upon
which
her
gaze
rested
but
a
pang
of
mortification
and
jealousy
penetrated
her
bosom
for
words
rang
in
her
ears
and
a
glance
told
her
that
his
eyes
were
riveted
upon
face
with
an
expression
of
passionate
admiration
the
scene
lasted
but
a
moment
flora
abashed
and
almost
terrified
shrank
back
and
hurried
away
closely
followed
by
lotte
who
felt
like
being
detected
in
a
somewhat
mean
act
of
espionage

in
this

was

in

in
the
fleecy
clouds
in
the
waters
of
the
fountain
in
the
shadows

the
night

the

and
lovely

determined
to

should

shakspere
grahame
entered
his
library
on
the
morning
following
his
interview
with
chewkle
at
least
an
hour
before
the
time
appointed
for
the
return
of
that
individual
with
the
deed
which
he
had
promised
to
obtain
and
of
which
he
had
possessed
himself
to
use
as
an
instrument
of
extortion
there
was
no
sound
in
the
library
save
the
ticking
of
the
valuable
and
exquisitely
finished
specimen
of
handicraft
the
skeleton
timepiece
upon
the
broad
marble
for
grahame
sat
with
hands
clasped
before
him
plunged
in
profound
and
uneasy
thought
but
though
a
stillness
pervaded
the
apartment
there
was
a
terrible
storm
raging
within
his
bosom
position
was
perilous
and
critical
on
attaining
his
majority
he
had
inherited
landed
property
from
which
he
derived
an
income
of
nearly
ten
thousand
a
year
and
personal
property
to
the
value
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
he
married
a
near
relative
of
a
scotch
duke
also
a
grahame
and
kin
of
many
of
the
proudest
if
poorest
families
in
scotland
with
her
he
had
a
dowry
of
ten
thousand
pounds
and
thus
he
may
be
said
to
have
commenced
his
married
life
in
a
station
of
affluence
and
with
the
brightest
prospects
of
happiness
but
he
had
during
his
minority
been
brought
up
in
parsimonious
seclusion
like
the
majority
of
his
race
he
was
burdened
with
an
arrogant
pride
a
pride
that
would
eat
toasted
herrings
and
potatoes
in
state
that
would
look
down
in
ineffable
scorn
upon
the
tradesmen
it
was
too
poor
to
pay
a
pride
that
was
essentially
inflation
and
wholly
devoid
of
true
dignity
when
approaching
manhood
provided
with
the
narrowest
allowance
he
had
preferred
to
be
chiefly
in
the
glen
or
on
the
mountain
where
but
little
money
was
needed
to
mixing
with
the
gay
world
into
which
his
narrow
stipend
would
have
introduced
him
slightly
above
the
condition
of
a
beggar
and
thus
he
passed
his
minority
away
yearning
for
the
death
of
his
miserly
father
who
scraped
and
saved
and
accumulated
without
a
thought
crossing
him
that
some
day
the
mean
and
acquisitive
spirit
which
inhabited
his
frame
would
take
its
flight
suddenly
to
the
unknown
land
and
with
the
old
and
withered
trunk
it
had
inhabited
leave
all
the
savings
and
dirty
hoardings
and
scrapings
behind
so
it
turned
out
one
morning
old
grahame
was
found
at
the
threshold
of
his
door
a
stiff
stark
grinning
corpse
and
claverhouse
grahame
was
declared
the
inheritor
of
ten
thousand
a
year
and
thirty
thousand
pounds
besides
shortly
after
this
he
encountered
margaret
grahame
as
she
was
marriageable
and
had
ten
thousand
pounds
by
way
of
dowry
he
proposed
for
her
hand
how
could
she
refuse
ten
thousand
a
year
the
possibility
of
liking
claverhouse
grahame
never
entered
her
imagination
she
took
him
as
part
of
the
fortune
rather
because
she
could
not
have
the
fortune
without
him
and
because
the
married
state
was
not
altogether
complete
without
a
husband
of
love
in
its
purity
and
holiness
she
had
no
conception
she
considered
her
father
and
mother
as
grand
and
dignified
persons
entitled
to
filial
respect
and
deference
from
her
she
was
passionately
fond
of
state
and
pomp
and
display
of
jewels
of
dress
of
genealogy
whatever
pertained
to
an
elevated
position
but
an
emotion
purely
disinterested
one
equal
to
a
she
never
possessed
she
gave
her
hand
to
grahame
because
the
act
brought
her
ten
thousand
a
year
her
heart
was
only
so
far
involved
in
the
transaction
that
it
vibrated
with
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
the
situation
in
which
such
an
income
would
place
her
it
was
a
natural
consequence
of
probation
and
his
immeasurable
pride
a
pride
which
like
his
had
been
confined
by
the
economical
style
of
living
adopted
by
her
parents
to
enable
them
to
give
such
a
wedding
portion
with
her
as
he
had
received
that
his
imagination
should
convert
the
capabilities
of
ten
thousand
a
year
into
those
of
five
times
the
amount
and
that
by
the
same
process
of
mental
exaggeration
his
forty
thousand
pounds
should
appear
inexhaustible
he
proceeded
to
live
as
though
his
income
possessed
an
elasticity
which
enabled
it
to
stretch
to
any
length
and
was
startled
at
the
end
of
some
few
years
to
find
that
his
forty
thousand
pounds
had
not
only
evaporated
but
that
his
liabilities
more
than
exceeded
three
income
he
was
too
proud
to
make
his
wife
acquainted
with
this
unpleasant
state
of
his
affairs
because
it
would
necessitate
suggestions
of
retrenchment
now
she
had
formed
so
large
an
estimate
of
her
dowry
that
he
was
quite
aware
she
would
taunt
him
with
having
unjustifiably
made
away
with
it
although
she
had
herself
spent
every
shilling
of
it
and
a
large
sum
in
addition
in
the
indulgence
of
her
overweening
pride
she
would
too
he
knew
hurl
upon
him
expressions
of
contempt
for
having
inveigled
her
with
so
splendid
a
jointure
from
her
castle
home
in
the
highlands
where
a
great
deal
of
dirty
state
was
maintained
at
a
small
cost
only
to
subject
her
to
the
degradation
of
being
compelled
when
she
formed
a
wish
suggested
for
the
gratification
of
her
darling
pride
to
take
the
means
of
accomplishing
it
into
consideration
he
therefore
said
not
a
word
to
her
and
went
on
as
before
save
that
he
looked
more
closely
into
his
own
affairs
raised
his
rents
where
possible
to
the
highest
limits
forgave
no
tenant
on
any
plea
arrears
and
squeezed
all
he
could
out
of
renewals
of
leases
hard
uncompromising
refusing
to
spend
a
shilling
on
his
land
he
was
hated
by
the
whole
tenantry
and
when
to
gratify
the
stately
dreams
of
his
wife
he
paid
an
annual
visit
to
the
castle
his
tenants
one
and
all
uttered
reluctantly
the
hurrahs
which
under
the
dark
threats
of
the
steward
they
gave
to
greet
his
arrival
in
spite
of
his
efforts
he
found
it
impossible
to
pay
off
his
liabilities
and
make
his
income
support
the
style
in
which
he
lived
what
he
contrived
to
save
his
wife
expended
growing
as
her
family
increased
in
years
more
arrogantly
proud
than
ever
it
was
not
that
she
lavished
or
squandered
money
but
her
tastes
were
enormously
expensive
she
bought
as
an
empress
preferring
to
give
many
hundreds
for
rare
objects
rather
than
single
pounds
for
articles
equally
handsome
but
more
common
and
it
was
these
heavy
drains
upon
his
resources
which
kept
grahame
in
a
perpetual
state
of
embarrassment
at
length
many
of
his
debts
assumed
a
pressing
character
he
shrank
from
appearing
in
a
eyes
deficient
in
funds
and
to
obtain
ready
cash
a
first
mortgage
on
a
portion
of
his
property
was
executed
once
within
the
vortex
rescue
by
the
aid
of
his
remaining
property
without
the
most
rigid
curtailment
of
every
unnecessary
expense
was
utterly
hopeless
and
at
the
moment
of
his
forging
name
to
the
deed
which
chewkle
had
that
morning
stolen
a
few
thousand
pounds
at
his
bankers
was
all
he
possessed
to
meet
heavy
engagements
and
all
the
future
for
every
acre
of
his
lands
was
in
the
possession
of
a
mortgagee
there
was
however
an
enormous
property
to
which
he
preferred
a
claim
by
right
of
descent
it
was
disputed
and
in
chancery
the
claimants
had
been
many
but
they
had
dwindled
down
by
death
to
two
himself
and
eustace
wilton
years
back
during
the
lifetime
of
the
owner
of
the
property
wilton
had
lived
upon
a
portion
of
the
estate
a
slice
of
considerable
dimensions
and
held
under
a
simple
document
a
deed
of
gift
though
not
drawn
up
by
a
lawyer
the
original
owner
died
suddenly
and
as
it
was
believed
intestate
as
he
died
without
issue
and
no
will
could
be
found
a
host
of
claimants
sprang
up
and
the
estate
went
into
chancery
then
wilton
was
called
upon
to
prove
his
claim
to
the
estate
he
held
and
to
improve
which
he
had
expended
every
sixpence
of
the
fortune
he
had
possessed
independent
of
it
he
produced
his
document
so
far
as
the
wording
of
the
instrument
went
it
had
full
legal
force
but
proof
was
needed
that
it
was
in
the
actual
handwriting
of
the
deceased
and
that
it
was
in
all
respects
executed
by
him
in
favour
of
wilton
given
freely
fairly
without
coercion
and
with
the
full
intention
that
wilton
should
enjoy
have
and
hold
possession
of
the
estate
thus
presented
to
him
for
ever
it
had
been
witnessed
but
the
witness
was
gone
away
no
one
knew
where
the
handwriting
of
the
document
was
questioned
and
on
the
trial
to
prove
title
to
the
estate
the
weight
of
evidence
for
and
against
its
being
genuine
was
divided
if
it
did
preponderate
it
was
rather
against
than
for
him
the
judge
held
the
of
the
witness
to
be
fatal
to
the
claim
and
a
verdict
was
so
given
the
property
was
therefore
wrested
from
wilton
he
was
turned
homeless
into
the
world
with
his
wife
and
family
while
the
estate
itself
was
joined
to
the
other
property
and
the
whole
income
went
into
the
hands
of
the
receiver
appointed
by
the
court
to
be
held
in
trust
disgorged
only
when
a
claimant
appeared
who
could
prove
his
title
to
inherit
it
in
the
claim
to
the
property
as
a
whole
wilton
was
the
nearest
of
kin
but
here
again
he
was
debarred
for
want
of
a
witness
who
was
believed
to
be
living
but
who
could
not
be
found
chain
of
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim
was
unbroken
and
his
title
to
the
property
indisputable
if
wilton
were
out
of
the
way
the
only
thing
which
debarred
obtaining
the
estates
was
a
doubt
thrown
upon
the
validity
of
his
marriage
grahame
knew
that
and
so
far
as
it
went
it
was
enough
to
keep
him
out
of
possession
but
if
wilton
signed
a
paper
waiving
all
claim
to
the
property
which
was
at
his
finger
tips
without
the
power
to
grasp
it
grahame
would
as
the
only
other
surviving
claimant
become
entitled
to
it
and
would
obtain
it
for
as
we
have
said
his
chain
of
evidence
proving
his
right
to
it
next
of
kin
failing
was
complete
in
all
its
parts
it
may
now
be
understood
how
immensely
important
it
was
to
him
to
obtain
signature
to
a
deed
which
he
had
had
most
carefully
drawn
up
and
we
have
seen
the
lengths
to
which
he
went
to
obtain
it
it
may
also
be
understood
wherefore
wilton
preferred
imprisonment
under
the
strong
hope
that
his
witness
would
some
day
appear
rather
than
sign
a
deed
which
excluded
not
only
himself
but
his
family
from
the
possession
of
wealth
which
was
in
truth
and
justice
though
not
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
law
actually
theirs
grahame
pondered
over
the
past
down
to
the
present
despairing
moment
what
was
now
to
be
done
with
the
payment
of
the
two
bonds
given
by
wilton
while
trying
his
right
to
possess
that
which
had
been
given
him
he
had
lost
all
power
by
pressure
over
him
and
destitution
perhaps
imprisonment
stared
him
in
the
face
no
not
imprisonment
no
not
that
he
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
case
which
with
a
furtive
glance
round
the
chamber
he
opened
it
contained
within
a
pair
of
pistols
he
took
one
out
and
examined
it
is
loaded
he
muttered
in
good
he
replaced
it
in
the
velvet
compartment
made
to
receive
it
and
returned
the
case
to
the
drawer
which
he
closed
and
locked
are
there
when
needful
he
said
between
his
clenched
teeth
grahame
knows
how
to
die
but
not
to
endure
the
degradation
of
poverty
and
ignominy
i
will
never
die
a
death
he
added
with
a
fearful
oath
he
pressed
his
hands
over
his
burning
forehead
and
racked
his
brain
to
find
a
path
by
which
he
could
conquer
his
difficulties
usurious
wretch
gomer
has
promised
me
funds
upon
the
very
document
which
before
this
he
must
know
will
not
be
completed
he
muttered
is
to
be
done
what
if
i
persist
in
affirming
that
the
signature
has
been
given
and
act
upon
the
man
advice
suborn
the
men
he
named
and
boldly
claim
the
whole
property
it
is
an
enormous
prize
and
worth
the
risk
i
can
pay
the
villains
well
to
hold
their
tongues
until
i
am
fairly
in
possession
and
then
then
who
knows
at
some
carouse
at
which
are
assembled
to
celebrate
their
success
something
in
their
drink
may
make
them
sleep
sleep
to
the
day
of
doom
i
do
not
like
the
man
chewkle
the
scoundrel
is
beginning
to
grow
insultingly
familiar
and
will
i
foresee
ere
long
assume
a
mastery
over
me
i
must
specially
direct
my
attention
to
his
permanent
welfare
when
by
his
aid
my
scheme
is
consummated
then
then
if
he
escapes
what
i
shall
prepare
for
him
his
good
fortune
will
be
a

sir
exclaimed
a
servant
suddenly
throwing
open
the
library
door
heart
leaped
within
him
and
it
palpitated
painfully
but
he
exhibited
his
accustomed
cold
him
in
he
exclaimed
chewkle
entered
with
the
air
of
a
disappointed
man
his
manner
presented
a
strong
contrast
to
the
offensive
easy
indifference
it
had
displayed
the
evening
before
grahame
detected
it
instantly
he
replied
to
bow
by
an
inclination
of
the
head
and
pointed
to
a
chair
upon
the
edge
of
which
chewkle
gently
sank
poising
himself
when
there
with
the
skill
of
a
performer
on
the
tight
rope
have
obtained
the
deed
chewkle
said
grahame
of
no
sir
returned
chewkle
quite
i
entertained
very
hopes
but
they
has
been
chucked
down
into
the
deeps
of
the
greatest
disappointment
them
lawyers
do
you
mean
they
did
not
refuse
to
give
it
to
you
asked
grahame
hastily
and
sternly
no
not
quite
that
where
is
it
jest
it
where
is
it
sir
jest
what
i
should
like
to
do
you
mean
cried
grahame
springing
to
his
feet
with
a
countenance
of
alarm
do
not
mean
to
say
it
has
been
stolen
cried
chewkle
leaping
up
with
a
face
suddenly
of
the
hue
of
scarlet
would
be
too
good
a
joke
too
prig
such
a
thing
as
that
like
to
know
yourself
man
you
are
speaking
in
enigmas
cried
grahame
excitedly
chewkle
drew
from
out
of
a
dirty
piece
of
light
brown
paper
which
had
been
employed
in
the
task
of
enclosing
of
sugar
the
letter
he
received
from
the
solicitor
grahame
snatched
it
from
him
and
tore
it
open
he
read
the
contents
twice
and
then
sat
down
and
reflected
for
a
minute
is
nothing
chewkle
he
said
more
composedly
i
perceive
in
this
communication
to
occasion
alarm
the
deed
will
be
sent
here
to
day
by
one
of
the
hopes
it
may
observed
chewkle
laconically
the
meantime
my
good
friend
said
grahame
assuming
a
bland
tone
have
been
pondering
over
the
situation
and
i
am
afraid
we
have
gone
a
little
too
far
to
pause
now
or
to
retrace
our
echoed
chewkle
opening
his
eyes
widely
continued
grahame
i
stand
in
the
position
of
a
principal
in
the
affair
you
take
the
part
of
an
accessory
before
the
fact
and
a
very
important
one
you
are
too
inasmuch
as
you
counselled
the
deed
and
instructed
me
how
to
perform
it
lending
your
assistance
chewkle
would
have
here
interposed
some
very
emphatic
observations
but
that
grahame
checked
him
and
continued
speaking
is
not
my
intention
he
said
my
wish
that
the
conversation
should
assume
its
present
tone
i
would
rather
that
it
took
a
shape
which
while
it
consulted
my
interest
gave
liberal
promise
of
rich
advantages
to
chewkle
pricked
up
his
ears
night
if
you
remember
said
grahame
slowly
fixing
his
eye
firmly
upon
that
of
his
threw
out
several
suggestions
calculated
to
afford
me
in
the
distress
of
mind
under
which
i
was
labouring
a
very
considerable
degree
of
consolation
do
you
remember
this
chewkle
caught
hold
of
his
dusty
shaggy
whiskers
at
the
roots
and
drew
them
out
to
their
full
extent
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
thumb
several
times
to
appear
the
unconscious
act
of
a
man
plunged
in
reflection
presently
he
said
altogether
certain
as
i
grahame
now
repeated
the
plan
which
he
had
the
previous
evening
proposed
to
accomplish
by
the
aid
of
jukes
and
his
companions
by
which
in
spite
of
all
protestations
and
oaths
to
the
contrary
the
signature
was
to
be
sworn
to
as
being
and
genuine
chewkle
listened
in
silence
and
when
grahame
concluded
by
observing
that
he
had
almost
decided
upon
adopting
it
chewkle
felt
himself
to
be
unpleasantly
situated
upon
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
grahame
had
been
candid
enough
to
acknowledge
that
unless
he
obtained
the
estate
he
would
be
lost
destroyed
unable
to
reward
the
services
of
any
person
but
that
if
he
by
the
assistance
of
friends
succeeded
in
securing
it
the
most
magnificent
recompense
should
be
bestowed
upon
them
difficulty
consisted
in
having
possession
of
the
deed
if
he
retained
it
it
seemed
that
grahame
would
be
reduced
to
poverty
and
his
of
the
guilty
act
of
forgery
would
bring
him
nothing
perhaps
but
the
questionable
advantage
of
being
brought
under
the
anxious
consideration
of
a
judge
and
jury
as
a
if
he
gave
it
up
to
grahame
he
would
have
to
account
for
its
possession
an
acknowledgment
of
the
truth
would
place
him
at
once
in
the
power
of
grahame
who
could
give
him
if
he
pleased
into
the
custody
of
the
police
as
a
thief
there
was
certainly
no
middle
course
to
steer
save
waiting
for
a
little
while
to
see
what
direction
matters
would
take
he
reflected
that
it
would
be
wise
not
to
be
precipitate
but
that
it
would
be
best
to
carefully
consider
whether
there
was
a
safe
way
to
hit
upon
which
would
conduct
him
out
of
his
perplexing
position
he
began
to
fear
he
had
been
too
hasty
in
securing
the
deed
the
possession
now
seemed
to
be
by
no
means
so
valuable
to
him
as
it
had
done
when
he
locked
it
up
carefully
in
his
iron
safe
the
figure
of
nathan
gomer
kept
dancing
before
his
eyes
too
in
the
most
disagreeable
fashion
it
was
embarrassingly
suggestive
and
it
disturbed
him
grahame
awaited
his
opinion
upon
the
adoption
of
the
desperate
course
with
impatience
and
at
length
said
hastily
are
you
silent
does
the
intention
to
carry
out
your
own
suggestion
startle
and
terrify
you
he
replied
is
not
that
but
swearing
point
blank
in
a
court
of
law
that
a
signature
to
a
deed
was
written
by
a
man
whose
hand
never
went
near
it
and
in
the
teeth
of
his
oath
to
the
contrary
altogether
to
be
done
without
a
good
deal
consideration
and
you
think
it
will
be
the
best
plan
to
wait
until
you
have
got
the
deed
back
in
your
own
hands
wherefore
it
is
in
the
custody
of
my
so
sure
about
that
suggested
chewkle
artfully
but
uncomfortably
could
not
find
it
this
his
managing
clerk
has
it
safe
enough
he
will
proceed
by
the
proper
legal
course
to
claim
the
estate
which
this
waiver
of
at
once
will
put
me
in
possession
of
of
course
wilton
will
dispute
it
we
shall
swear
he
signed
to
be
released
from
the
judgments
we
held
against
him
prove
his
signature
on
oath
i
obtain
the
estate
and
you
and
your
friends
a
rich
reward
therefore
having
finally
resolved
to
pursue
this
plan
the
deed
can
not
be
better
placed
than
where
it
is
chewkle
shook
his
head
he
had
rather
the
deed
had
been
anywhere
but
where
it
now
was
he
however
interposed
no
further
objection
but
suggested
that
he
should
pay
a
visit
to
jukes
and
nutty
to
sound
them
upon
the
matter
see
sir
this
plan
makes
us
commit
perjury
as
well
as
forgery
he
exclaimed
laying
such
emphasis
on
the
two
crimes
that
grahame
started
and
involuntarily
shuddered
he
continued
is
not
every
man
who
has
the
pluck
to
take
a
false
oath
and
stick
to
it
stick
to
it
the
rub
sir
taking
a
false
oath
much
but
when
the
counsel
begins
to
badger
you
and
to
ask
you
this
question
and
that
sometimes
about
the
subjeck
and
sometimes
about
things
as
has
nothen
to
do
with
it
and
then
comes
slap
back
to
the
subjeck
again
so
as
to
jerk
a
contradictory
confession
out
on
you
that
as
tries
you
i
got
much
doubt
about
jukes
he
can
stand
any
amount
he
can
but
i
certain
about
however
i
will
go
onto
at
once
sound
cautiously
without
using
any
observed
grahame
approvingly
if
they
agrees
i
will
come
to
terms
with
them
and
if
they
must
get
some
one
else
suggested
grahame
chewikle
passed
his
hand
over
his
chin
he
replied
is
if
they
are
to
be
very
few
words
more
were
interchanged
between
them
ere
chewkle
quitted
the
house
cursing
the
deed
which
he
had
with
such
an
exercise
of
cunning
purloined
and
which
would
require
so
much
ingenuity
to
restore
and
leave
him
unsuspected
of
the
theft
and
forgery
exclaimed
grahame
as
soon
as
he
knew
himself
to
be
alone
is
hastening
on
in
the
career
of
crime
what
if
some
voice
were
to
howl
in
the
ear
of
mistress
grahame
that
her
husband
was
a
perjurer
and
a
forger
a
grahame
one
of
the
race
that
has
prided
itself
upon
never
having
cowered
under
the
taint
of
dishonour
a
wretched
criminal
liable
to
be
dragged
with
all
the
horrors
of
the
lowest
degradation
to
the
bar
of
justice
thence
to
work
out
in
chains
a
fearful
servitude
in
the
company
of
wretches
the
most
desperate
into
what
a
frightful
position
has
my
pecuniary
embarrassment
hurled
me
henceforth
i
shall
live
in
perpetual
horror
of
discovery
of
being
called
upon
at
any
moment
to
face
an
officer
a
loud
single
knock
at
the
library
door
at
this
moment
made
his
heart
leap
into
his
mouth
and
nearly
caused
him
to
scream
with
fright
but
that
his
voice
forsook
him
before
he
could
recover
sufficiently
to
accord
permission
to
enter
nathan
gomer
walked
into
the
room
pale
and
haggard
grahame
regarded
him
with
any
other
feeling
than
that
of
complacency
nathan
gomer
held
mortgages
on
his
property
and
had
advanced
money
on
a
bond
the
day
of
payment
named
in
it
was
fast
approaching
he
had
also
promised
upon
certain
security
to
furnish
additional
funds
grahame
could
only
look
upon
him
with
the
eyes
of
one
deeply
indebted
to
him
he
believed
that
he
would
realise
some
portion
of
the
sums
he
had
loaned
but
he
knew
that
if
fate
proved
adverse
to
him
nathan
would
lose
largely
as
well
he
both
hated
and
feared
him
and
he
viewed
his
presence
now
with
distrust
he
anticipated
that
he
was
the
harbinger
of
bad
news
everything
had
gone
so
wrong
of
late
there
was
nothing
else
to
expect
nathan
gomer
turned
up
his
shining
yellow
visage
and
grinned
how
grahame
loathed
that
grin
it
seemed
to
betoken
only
mischief
he
motioned
to
nathan
to
take
a
chair
and
in
a
husky
voice
begged
to
be
informed
what
fortunate
circumstance
it
was
to
which
he
was
indebted
for
the
felicity
his
presence
thus
unannounced
afforded
him
matter
i
apprehend
of
no
small
importance
to
you
grahame
replied
nathan
grahame
gulped
no
doubt
it
was
of
importance
to
him
he
expected
that
most
painful
importance
what
else
could
it
be
think
i
am
prepared
he
said
anything
you
may
have
to
communicate
to
me
whatever
distressing
features
it
may
think
not
said
nathan
you
have
a
new
neighbour
next
door
to
you
he
pointed
as
he
spoke
and
asked
you
know
his
name
grahame
looked
at
him
with
some
surprise
what
did
such
a
question
portend
nathan
only
grinned
and
grahame
answered
coldly
am
not
accustomed
to
take
any
notice
of
my
neighbours
or
trouble
myself
to
make
inquiries
respecting
would
have
been
interested
if
you
had
in
the
present
ejaculated
grahame
a
curl
turning
his
lip
his
name
is
wilton
eustace
wilton
ah
you
are
interested
grahame
clutched
nathan
by
the
arm
he
shouted
wretched
man
dying
inch
by
inch
in
his
poverty
a
day
or
so
back
in
the
prison
and
next
door
neighbour
with
an
income
of
five
thousand
and
cash
to
the
tune
of
sixty
thousand
replied
nathan
gomer
with
forcible
emphasis
groaned
grahame
ejaculated
gomer
what
magic
has
it
been
accomplished
inquired
grahame
apparently
stupefied
by
what
he
heard
magic
at
all
returned
nathan
gomer
grinning
simple
process
of
law
years
ago
a
near
relative
named
eglinton
a
connection
of
your
own
gave

him
an

a
trumped
grahame
be
careful
what
you
say
until
you
have
heard
more
when
our
tongues
run
away
with
us
we
have
sometimes
occasion
to
lament
the
want
of
a
curb
this
estate
was
taken
from
him
by
the
court
of
chancery
because
he
failed
only
to
produce
the
attesting
the
witness
was
a
fiction
an
imaginary
person
has
recently
returned
from
india
a
colonel
in
the
east
india
service
and
sufficiently
tangible
to
satisfy
the
law
this
officer
has
not
only
sworn
to
the
genuineness
of
the
deed
of
gift
but
has
proved
its
validity
by
giving
information
of
the
existence
of
a
duplicate
lodged
by
eglinton
himself
in
the
hands
of
a
solicitor
long
since
retired
from
practice
this
has
been
produced

to
the
satisfaction
of
the
chancellor
and
the
estate
together
with
the
large
arrears
accumulated
are
in
the
process
of
being
restored
to
grahame
listened
in
grim
silence
he
felt
choking
with
spite
and
envy
the
man
he
had
pressed
to
the
verge
of
despair
in
the
hope
to
compel
him
to
sign
away
his
birthright
was
now
immeasurably
his
superior
in
position
as
he
was
his
equal
in
descent
he
would
be
a
formidable
antagonist
to
fight
with
the
miserable
deed
he
had
forged
he
could
not
dare
to
attempt
it
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
with
a
groan
nathan
gomer
had
brought
him
ill
news
indeed
he
had
expected
foul
tidings
yet
not
such
as
this
he
could
have
wept
scalding
tears
of
bitterness
vexation
and
rage
he
bit
his
white
and
trembling
lips
and
exerting
himself
to
control
his
tremulous
voice
he
said
is
to
give
me
this
information
you
have
waited
upon
me
gomer
i
suppose
and
with
no
other
object
the
misty
shapes
dancing
before
his
eyes
began
to
take
the
distinct
form
of
a
pistol
with
which
he
had
resolved
to
anticipate
the
thunderbolt
hovering
over
to
crush
him
have
another
object
calculated
i
think
to
prove
vastly
advantageous
to
you
returned
nathan
with
a
grin
know
i
have
your
interest
at
heart
he
grined
again
i
wish
to
serve
you
in
my
own
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
grinned
again
then
he
went
on
and
wilton
are
the
claimants
to
the
whole
of
old
property
wilton
wants
a
witness
you
want
wilton
dead
hem
all
this
time
neither
of
you
are
deriving
any
benefit
from
the
property
now
supposing
you
and
wilton
were
to
unite
your
claims
and
possess
it
jointly
the
sum
accumulated
in
arrears
is
enormous
and
the
yearly
rental
largely
improved
since
death
is
at
least
thirty
thousand
now
an
income
of
fifteen
thousand
pounds
sterling
with
half
the
enormous
sum
in
cash
for
each
would
not
be
so
bad
i
conceive
the
money
would
be
doing
more
good
i
suspect
administering
to
the
comforts
the
pleasures
the
enjoyments
of
yourselves
and
respective
families
than
it
will
in
swelling
the
millions
already
held
in
trust
by
the
court
of
chancery
how
say
you
grahame
what
is
your
opinion
of
my
proposition
all
the
time
nathan
gomer
was
speaking
grahame
experienced
a
variety
of
emotions
he
was
cold
and
hot
by
turns
now
his
knees
quivered
and
his
teeth
chattered
anon
he
burnt
as
if
scorched
by
fever
what
burst
of
sunshine
was
this
on
a
heart
almost
buried
in
a
dense
gloom
what
sudden
saving
hand
was
this
lifting
him
up
out
of
the
quicksands
of
almost
fathomless
debt
and
placing
him
upon
a
rock
firm
enough
to
stand
the
shock
of
any
storm
what
haven
of
safety
was
this
stretching
out
its
unassailable
arms
to
receive
him
into
its
secure
shelter
even
while
sinking
beneath
the
hurricane
raging
around
him
did
he
hear
aright
had
nathan
gomer
come
hither
only
to
taunt
him
the
dwarf
albeit
he
grinned
seemed
to
be
perfectly
earnest
and
sincere
in
his
proposition
and
had
no
doubt
good
grounds
for
making
it
it
struck
grahame
suddenly
that
wilton
had
perhaps
ascertained
that
his
chance
of
obtaining
any
of
the
property
beyond
what
he
had
recovered
was
hopeless
and
therefore
now
sought
by
a
stratagem
to
secure
half
if
this
were
the
fact
there
was
nothing
to
bar
claim
to
all
and
the
splendid
income
with
the
immense
sum
in
ready
cash
roused
his
avarice
it
dazzled
his
vision
not
a
farthing
should
wilton
have
if
he
could
obtain
all
all
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
be
to
possess
himself
of
all
he
did
not
observe
how
keenly
nathan
was
perusing
his
features
nor
conceive
with
what
skilled
eyes
he
read
in
their
changing
expression
the
thoughts
which
were
passing
through
his
mind
he
little
thought
how
bare
his
base
greed
lay
before
the
man
from
whom
of
all
others
he
would
have
most
concealed
it
after
a
pause
purposely
made
by
him
to
reduce
his
tone
of
voice
and
his
manner
to
an
attitude
of
perfect
calm
he
said
to
nathan
friend
wilton
of
course
suggested
this
proposition
does
not
even
dream
of
it
was
the
reply
the
contrary
he
is
most
sanguine
of
shortly
discovering
the
witness
who
can
prove
the
validity
of
his
marriage
with
his
father
certainly
his
chances
of
doing
so
are
such
as
to
bar
any
other
claim
to
the
property
until
it
is
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
all
his
efforts
have
hopelessly
failed
in
the
meantime
you
have
heavy
liabilities
approaching
maturity
you
best
know
what
resources
you
possess
to
meet
them
and
if
they
are
not
unquestionable
and
beyond
the
reach
of
casualties
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
leap
with
gladness
at
the
chance
of
suddenly
acquiring
the
wealth
my
suggestion
would
place
within
your
grahame
thought
for
a
moment
his
present
position
was
very
ugly
still
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
think
a
proposition
so
extraordinary
as
this
would
be
made
to
him
unless
his
chances
of
obtaining
the
property
had
in
some
manner
unknown
to
himself
materially
improved
now
if
he
could
elicit
this
he
would
not
for
an
instant
hesitate
to
decline
to
accede
to
the
terms
and
with
this
object
he
commenced
to
nathan
gomer
but
before
he
had
completed
a
sentence
a
servant
entered
with
a
letter
grahame
recognised
the
superscription
as
his
handwriting
and
saying
to
gomer
hastily
me
he
tore
it
open
and
read
its
contents
they
were
to
inform
him
that
the
managing
clerk
of
the
firm
having
returned
it
was
ascertained
that
he
had
not
had
the
deed
it
must
therefore
be
unfortunately
mislaid
grahame
was
assured
that
prompt
steps
would
be
taken
to
recover
it
but
if
they
failed
the
usual
course
to
discover
any
article
of
importance
missing
or
stolen
would
be
adopted
without
the
least
loss
of
time
grahame
was
aghast
at
this
information
that
the
deed
was
lost
or
stolen
was
clear
in
either
case
his
position
was
painfully
embarrassing
the
proposal
of
nathan
gomer
was
therefore
a
harbour
of
refuge
to
be
secured
instanter
to
be
secured
at
all
so
he
turned
to
him
and
said
quickly
reason
have
you
to
suppose
that
wilton
will
meet
your
views
if
he
is
in
the
position
in
this
affair
which
you
declare
him
to
be
is
unnecessary
to
give
my
reason
will
you
have
an
interview
with
him
upon
the
subject
yes
yes
readily
when
shall
it
take
place
minute
if
you
will
i
know
that
he
is
at
is
so
sudden
hardly
imagine
the
possession
of
fifteen
thousand
can
occur
too
soon
for
your
peace
and
safety
on
sir
i
will
accompany
within
five
minutes
from
that
time
nathan
gomer
and
grahame
were
ushered
into
library
the
persecutor
and
the
persecuted
stood
face
to
face
chapter
selfishness
and
sorrow
but
most
the
proud
honoria
event
and
thought
to
her
alone
the
vision
sent
her
guilt
presents
to
her
distracted
mind
justice
dryden
if
flora
lovely
countenance
had
so
remarkable
an
effect
upon
the
duke
of
allborne
and
specially
upon
the
heart
of
the
honorable
lester
vane
it
is
very
certain
that
the
persons
of
those
gentlemen
made
no
such
impression
either
upon
flora
or
even
lotte
both
were
so
embarrassed
at
their
sudden
intrusion
as
it
appeared
upon
the
privacy
of
the
party
in
the
adjoining
garden
that
they
hurried
away
without
taking
particular
notice
of
the
individuals
composing
it
but
both
flora
and
lotte
had
a
floating
impression
that
one
of
the
gentlemen
there
had
large
deep
dark
eyes
and
that
he
used
them
too
unreservedly
and
unscrupulously
flora
had
also
an
idea
of
a
fair
young
gentle
face
the
soft
eyes
of
which
regarded
her
with
tenderness
and
admiration
beyond
this
nothing
was
retained
in
their
minds
of
the
persons
they
had
encountered
flora
only
laughingly
suggested
that
she
should
scarcely
attempt
again
to
observe
her
garden
from
that
point
of
view
both
girls
had
quite
overlooked
malcolm
grahame
but
if
the
duke
and
lester
vane
were
struck
by
the
beauty
of
face
so
was
malcolm
by
that
of
lotte
it
was
precisely
of
that
order
of
prettiness
which
especially
commended
itself
to
his
taste
selfish
and
proud
as
his
mother
silly
and
conceited
too
there
was
not
much
space
in
his
heart
for
affection
nevertheless
passion
occupied
a
tolerably
large
space
and
the
gratification
of
it
was
a
first
consideration
with
him
in
his
eyes
lotte
was
the
girl
he
had
yet
seen
and
to
call
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
kingdom
his
was
an
ambition
he
did
not
count
the
cost
even
to
the
poor
girl
who
was
to
be
captured
and
wear
his
chains
he
had
found
satins
and
jewels
and
golden
gifts
achieve
wonders
he
believed
there
was
no
limit
to
their
efficacy
in
conquering
a
scruples
and
he
had
the
strongest
possible
conviction
that
if
employed
without
reserve
or
hesitation
the
most
severely
rigid
propriety
would
succumb
to
their
influence
to
be
smitten
with
the
face
of
lotte
was
to
desire
to
obtain
her
he
viewed
it
as
a
question
of
time
and
money
and
he
made
a
memorandum
in
his
to
that
effect
lotte
thus
favoured
by
his
admiration
and
his
intentions
had
not
observed
him
if
she
had
she
would
have
forgotten
him
immediately
afterwards
no
her
thoughts
were
employed
upon
the
future
under
the
care
and
kindness
of
flora
she
had
in
one
short
week
won
back
more
strength
and
health
than
she
would
have
done
in
a
month
under
the
roof
of
bantom
or
such
an
one
as
she
could
herself
afford
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
her
mind
was
at
peace
in
respect
to
the
present
and
hopeful
as
regarded
the
future
one
week
longer
she
decided
to
stay
beneath
the
roof
of
her
good
friend
and
then
into
the
world
again
that
she
might
eat
the
bread
for
which
her
own
hands
had
laboured
successfully
it
was
in
vain
that
flora
endeavoured
to
change
her
determination
her
nature
and
free
spirit
recoiled
from
being
indebted
even
to
flora
for
a
home
so
long
as
she
had
strength
to
work
and
was
able
to
obtain
it
she
would
support
herself
until
she
became
the
wife
of
the
man
she
had
yet
to
see
and
love
and
then
if
able
to
keep
her
she
would
accept
the
luxury
the
wedded
state
might
afford
her
if
not
they
would
work
together
and
together
win
a
living
for
both
she
did
not
refuse
to
accept
from
flora
a
complete
stock
of
clothes
nor
the
loan
of
a
small
sum
of
money
to
start
with
nor
did
she
ridiculously
refuse
her
profferred
assistance
in
procuring
an
apartment
in
a
respectable
dwelling
nor
when
flora
urged
upon
her
to
employ
her
abilities
upon
some
description
of
needlework
less
slavish
and
better
paid
than
making
did
she
refuse
to
make
the
effort
or
hesitate
to
accept
work
from
a
juvenile
clothing
warehouse
obtained
through
the
influence
of
new
dressmaker
her
spirit
of
independence
was
neither
fastidious
nor
affected
it
was
genuine
sincere
and
directed
her
along
a
path
that
while
by
her
open
ingenuous
cheerful
loving
disposition
she
gained
the
affection
of
all
who
knew
her
she
commanded
their
respect
by
eschewing
all
obligations
calculated
to
fetter
her
freedom
of
action
malcolm
grahame
during
the
last
few
days
of
his
stay
had
contrived
to
ascertain
her
name
and
the
information
that
she
was
a
humble
friend
of
miss
a
communication
he
received
with
great
satisfaction
because
it
intimated
that
she
was
poor
to
be
poor
was
to
be
accessible
to
temptation
and
he
resolved
to
use
gold
profusely
to
gain
her
he
little
thought
while
making
this
ignoble
calculation
that
he
himself
stood
on
the
very
brink
of
a
degraded
beggary
lotte
was
poor
but
her
poverty
had
no
blur
of
dishonour
upon
it
he
caught
sight
of
her
walking
alone
in
the
garden
several
times
and
rushed
to
an
upper
window
to
waft
a
kiss
his
fingers
to
her
or
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
left
side
of
a
rather
narrow
chest
or
to
render
himself
conspicuously
ridiculous
in
other
ways
his
vagaries
were
uselessly
performed
and
expended
without
result
for
lotte
did
not
once
perceive
him
and
left
the
roof
of
flora
wilton
in
the
park
without
knowing
or
desiring
to
know
that
any
such
vain
heartless
coxcomb
as
malcolm
grahame
was
in
existence
the
interview
between
old
wilton
and
grahame
was
brief
on
the
side
of
the
former
it
was
conducted
with
cold
dignity
and
on
the
latter
after
two
or
three
revelations
were
made
which
yet
further
opened
his
eyes
to
the
tremendous
character
of
the
gulf
on
the
verge
of
which
he
had
stood
with
so
slippery
a
footing
with
an
oily
obsequiousness
which
was
contemptible
nathan
gomer
conducted
the
whole
proceedings
and
displayed
an
influence
over
wilton
the
more
extraordinary
as
it
was
evidently
not
obtained
at
the
price
of
pecuniary
obligations
the
preliminaries
were
all
arranged
grahame
consenting
to
terms
which
gave
him
the
enjoyment
of
half
the
property
and
surplus
funds
in
trust
until
the
claim
of
wilton
was
fully
substantiated
when
grahame
was
to
resign
his
half
and
enter
upon
arrangements
by
which
he
would
gradually
restore
to
the
estate
the
sums
he
had
received
from
it
the
arrangement
was
far
from
being
a
satisfactory
one
to
grahame
but
his
position
was
that
of
a
drowning
man
and
therefore
he
was
only
too
glad
to
seize
anything
that
floated
within
his
reach
by
which
he
might
support
himself
for
a
time
if
not
save
himself
altogether
a
memorandum
was
drawn
up
by
nathan
who
grinned
as
he
composed
it
grinned
as
grahame
signed
it
and
grinned
yet
more
when
he
appended
his
name
as
a
witness
to
it
he
even
laughed
a
fat
chuckling
laugh
as
he
drew
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
sheet
of
paper
upon
which
the
memorandum
was
executed
bore
the
proper
stamp
it
was
turn
to
smile
when
throwing
a
cold
doubt
upon
the
realisation
of
the
estates
to
be
thus
divided
gomer
laconically
requested
him
to
furnish
him
with
a
list
of
his
most
pressing
engagements
and
he
would
at
once
liquidate
them
have
some
thousands
lying
idle
at
my
bankers
he
said
may
as
well
realize
a
slightly
better
percentage
from
the
security
questioned
grahame
doubtfully
require
nothing
more
than
your
acknowledgment
of
the
amounts
advanced
and
your
copy
of
this
memorandum
replied
gomer
grahame
assented
delightedly
and
would
have
taken
the
most
affectionate
farewell
of
both
wilton
and
nathan
gomer
but
that
the
former
coldly
repelled
him
and
the
latter
grinned
in
his
face
in
a
manner
so
strangely
impish
that
he
involuntarily
shuddered
and
hastened
away
as
he
descended
the
stairs
he
encountered
flora
wilton
just
as
she
was
entering
her
favourite
a
small
one
overlooking
the
garden
he
started
as
he
caught
sight
of
her
upturned
face
and
turning
to
nathan
gomer
who
was
following
him
he
said
wilton
i
nathan
nodded
strikingly
beautiful
he
ejaculated
introduce
me
he
added
gomer
did
so
briefly
saying
will
soon
have
the
opportunity
of
knowing
each
other
truth
gomer
exclaimed
grahame
in
his
grandest
manner
shall
look
forward
with
impatience
for
that
honour
i
need
not
add
and
high
flora
could
only
look
timidly
from
one
to
the
other
and
feel
extremely
relieved
by
the
absence
of
both
nathan
gomer
having
ere
they
parted
reiterated
his
promise
of
supplying
grahame
with
all
the
funds
his
present
need
required
that
gentleman
walked
into
his
mansion
with
the
cold
loftiness
of
a
sultan
and
with
high
elation
of
spirits
not
that
the
latter
emotion
rendered
him
cheerful
on
the
contrary
it
expanded
and
inflated
his
pride
it
made
him
look
over
to
the
verge
of
the
horizon
and
believe
the
lands
and
domains
between
were
his
own
it
made
him
regard
his
servants
as
serfs
his
tradespeople
as
vassals
his
acquaintances
as
persons
who
lived
only
to
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
his
smiles
himself
an
imperial
personage
to
whom
it
was
the
duty
of
the
world
in
general
to
bow
down
and
worship
during
the
last
ten
days
he
had
felt
rather
disposed
to
sneak
out
of
sight
than
to
exhibit
his
greatness
to
wondering
eyes
now
removed
from
the
danger
of
imminent
disgrace
his
own
grand
staircase
appeared
too
circumscribed
for
the
majesty
of
his
presence
whelks
who
had
by
hot
lotions
and
cold
lotions
and
fomentations
and
blistering
garlic
new
flannel
a
couple
of
calomel
pills
and
a
of
black
draught
subdued
the
lost
a
sovereign
how
he
was
mystified
in
imagining
and
taken
the
form
of
a
ghostly
shadow
noticed
the
change
in
his
master
but
with
infinitely
less
surprise
than
that
alteration
which
made
him
almost
familiar
with
chewkle
with
the
instinctive
perception
of
individuals
of
his
class
he
presumed
by
the
ascendancy
of
the
commission
agent
that
was
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
find
out
what
hence
his
civility
to
chewkle
and
his
desire
to
form
an
acquaintance
with
him
whatever
that
something
was
it
was
plain
by
his
resumption
of
stern
pomposity
that
it
was
grahame
preceded
by
whelks
entered
the
room
in
which
he
expected
to
find
grahame
and
one
at
least
of
her
daughters
but
the
whole
family
as
well
as
the
two
guests
who
had
been
prevailed
to
extend
their
visit
beyond
the
term
originally
intended
were
assembled
together
engaged
in
conversation
which
did
not
pause
for
an
instant
at
the
appearance
of
grahame
it
be
pawsible
lady

exclaimed
the
young
duke
addressing
miss
margaret
grahame
using
the

said
in

to
one
of

chawming
sex
scarcely
noticed
the
person
returned
margaret
in
a
cold
supercilious
tone
bending
her
eyes
upon
a
magnificently
jewelled
bracelet
clasping
her
fat
white
arm
which
she
placed
in
various
positions
to
study
the
effect
of
the
ornament
and
to
admire
trinket
and
arm
together
helen
looked
up
at
the
duke
with
a
quick
action
and
a
glittering
eye
she
said
in
a
slightly
petulant
tone
dolls
have
the
divinest
faces
my
lord
duke
yet
we
do
not
fall
into
raptures
with
assuredly
miss
grahame
observed
lester
vane
slowly
little
children
do
in
their
eyes
faces
possess
immense
attractions
and
they
have
a
title
to
be
ranked
as
the
best
judges
of
beauty
in
dolls
he
paused
and
looked
into
eyes
men
lay
claim
to
be
of
loveliness
in
woman
she
responded
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
sneer
he
bowed
indeed
they
ought
to
be
he
rejoined
quickly
why
are
your
sex
so
desirous
to
obtain
the
approving
admiration
of
ours
fallacy
which
your
sex
has
the
impertinence
to
assert
and
the
fatuity
to
believe
she
responded
with
a
curling
lip
shrewd
imbecility
nevertheless
returned
vane
smiling
meaningly
say
you
miss
evangeline
i
think
she
had
the
sweetest
face
i
ever
beheld
exclaimed
evangeline
with
an
enthusiasm
which
afflicted
grahame
if
that
lady
permitted
any
emotion
residing
soberly
within
her
frame
to
agitate
itself
to
the
extent
of
affliction
cried
malcolm
like
dolls
even
now
the
fact
is
you
are
all
at
fault
the
companion
was
the
prettiest
of
the
haw
maid
inquired
the
duke
extending
his
eyebrows
half
way
up
his
forehead
her
friend
i
have
seen
them
arm
in

none
of
you
looked
at
her
face
i
did
she
had
the
prettiest
in
christendom
allborne
all
the
world
to
i
without
inadvertence
inquire
whose
merits
you
are
discussing
inquired
grahame
with
a
loftiness
he
had
for
some
time

romantic

grahame
fiercely
as

as

apparitions
of
angelic
beauty
present
themselves
in

returned
the
duke
the

she

faw
an

and
then
we
aw
divided
in
opinion
with
wespect
to

the
manner
of
grahame
in
a
moment
strangely
altered
its
character
young
lady
is
exquisitely
beautiful
he
exclaimed
with
an
emphasis
which
made
grahame
slowly
elongate
upwards
and
margaret
claverhouse
open
her
eyes
to
their
full
extent
while
the
others
looked
at
him
with
surprise
at
length
grahame
found
a
tongue
should
have
hardly
conceived
that
such
a
person
had
attracted
the
notice
of
grahame
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
contemptuous
surprise
have
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
the
young
father
he
returned
sharply
stung
by
the
tone
of
his
remark
grahame
knew
not
how
to
support
this
dreadful
wound
to
her
pride
her
upper
lip
trembled
grahame
she
said
you
been
seized
by
the
weakness
of
toadying
to
some
man
some
person
some
mushroom
trader
because
he
has
been
able
to
make
a
little
parade
by
successful
plunder
mistress
grahame
exclaimed
grahame
with
imperious
grandeur
you
suffer
yourself
to
be
betrayed
into
any
observation
you
may
be
disposed
hereafter
to
recall
let
me
inform
you
that
wilton
the
father
of
the
young
lady
of
whom
you
appear
to
speak
and
think
so
slightingly
is
a
gentleman
possessing
twenty
thousand
a
year
and
cash
to
the
extent
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
an
exclamation
burst
from
the
lips
of
all
present
grahame
felt
that
she
had
been
premature
how
margaret
began
to
hate
flora
me
add
continued
grahame
wilton
can
claim
an
older
and
a
nobler
descent
than
either
you
madam
or
myself
in
his
veins
runs
the
blood
of
the
stuarts
the
eglintons
the
grahames
and
the
gordons
when
therefore
you
apply
the
epithets
of
and
to
him
you
injuriously
insult
a
gentleman
entitled
to
your
highest
he
ought
to
have
added
also
for
the
of
his
proud
lady
short
time
back
he
was
a
pauper
whom
i
sued
and
thrust
into
grahame
was
sure
now
she
had
been
premature
margaret
hated
flora
more
than
ever
she
had
despised
her
before
she
feared
her
now
cried
the
duke
is
a
twuly
bwilliant
to
owaw
womance
gwahame
you
must
pawsitively
intwoduce
me
to
that
delightful
young
lady
miss
what
is
haw
name
responded
grahame
grahame
will
probably
make
a
visit
to
miss
wilton
and
introduce
the
young
ladies
miss
wilton
i
have
no
doubt
will
be
induced
to
return
the
visit
this
as
a
matter
of
course
our
families
are
though
distantly
related
wilton
descends
from
the
elder
shall
have
the
greatest
pleasure
in
paying
a
visit
to
this
pearl
of
beauty
said
grahame
with
an
animation
quite
unusual
to
her
regret
my
hasty
observations
but
who
could
have
dreamed
that
our
next
neighbour
was
of
such
distinguished
birth
and
position
and
a
relative
too
i
will
not
defer
my
visit
and
taking
advantage
of
the
relationship
waive
a
portion
of
that
ceremony
i
consider
it
essential
in
other
cases
to
i
shall
have
too
an
introduction
to
this
of
beauty
thought
lester
vane
will
save
me
a
world
of
i
not
go
with
you
when
you
pay
your
first
visit
to
miss
wilton
dear
mamma
asked
evangeline
muttered
margaret
contemptuously
will
go
alone
i
shall
not
grahame
frowned
his
wife
caught
the
expression
of
his
face
and
in
a
tone
which
her
daughters
all
knew
was
intended
to
silence
opposition
she
said
and
margaret
will
accompany
me
they
will
exert
themselves
to
win
the
favourable
opinion
of
their
relative
attracting
her
to
visit
us
by
their
cheerful
smiles
rather
than
repelling
her
by
any
formal
frigidity
you
evangeline
who
set
all
the
rules
of
propriety
at
defiance
must
remain
at
home
or
you
will
only
commit
yourself
in
some
such
manner
as
heroines
do
in
you
think
i
ought
to
accompany
you
madam
exclaimed
malcolm
with
a
strong
impression
that
he
should
get
an
opportunity
of
exchanging
looks
and
words
with
lotte
think
the
visit
will
hardly
be
without
my
it
suddenly
struck
grahame
that
a
match
between
malcolm
and
flora
wilton
would
in
all
respects
be
most
desirable
the
young
lady
possessed
a
long
line
of
ancestry
wealth
and
beauty
what
more
could
a
man
desire
in
a
wife
a
marriage
too
would
end
the
conflicting
interests
of
both
parties
he
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
wilton
would
gladly
embrace
the
advantages
offered
by
such
a
plan
and
he
therefore
almost
looked
upon
it
as
being
accomplished
his
own
future
peace
being
secured
by
the
arrangement
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
flora
might
object
or
malcolm
offer
any
opposition
he
looked
upon
marriage
as
a
contract
in
which
it
was
the
duty
to
secure
for
their
children
eligible
matches
and
for
the
children
to
unhesitatingly
complete
them
he
was
immediately
therefore
anxious
that
malcolm
should
accompany
his
mother
and
his
suggestion
took
the
shape
of
a
command
no
one
but
himself
had
any
inkling
of
his
project
but
though
some
little
surprise
was
manifested
no
remark
was
made
or
objection
raised
as
the
visit
was
not
to
be
paid
until
the
next
morning
the
subject
was
here
changed
and
lester
vane
as
before
addressed
his
attentions
almost
exclusively
to
helen
he
rarely
spoke
to
her
without
conveying
a
meaning
beyond
the
apparent
import
of
his
words
he
omitted
no
opportunity
either
by
word
or
glance
to
induce
her
to
believe
that
he
was
fascinated
by
her
personal
attractions
and
charmed
by
the
graces
of
her
mind
she
threw
herself
as
much
in
his
way
as
possible
whether
in
the
presence
of
her
family
or
alone
and
she
exerted
all
her
powers
to
enslave
him
she
was
by
turns
full
of
fire
and
life
seemingly
gratified
by
his
presence
anon
cold
and
pettish
she
would
laugh
with
him
and
frown
at
him
display
interest
in
what
he
said
or
did
when
he
appeared
least
to
desire
to
chain
her
attention
and
seem
most
provokingly
indifferent
when
he
wished
her
to
listen
to
him
heedfully
most
of
all
when
alone
did
she
play
with
him
when
by
some
tenderness
of
manner
he
would
be
induced
to
commence
acknowledgments
warmer
than
those
warranted
by
friendship
she
would
parry
his
observations
turn
them
to
ridicule
or
give
to
them
an
interpretation
they
were
never
intended
to
bear
so
that
he
would
trust
only
to
his
expressive
eyes
to
say
what
she
refused
to
hear
his
tongue
utter
he
could
tell
by
her
drooping
lid
and
rising
blush
that
she
comprehended
that
language
and
that
if
she
would
defiantly
encounter
his
gaze
she
must
read
it
and
interpret
it
loves
me
he
would
say
to
himself
she
must
be
mine
under
what
contract
circumstances
must
alone
decide
for
that
decision
was
arrived
at
when
he
heard
that
flora
wilton
was
well
born
and
rich
his
hand
should
be
for
her
his
passion
for
helen
it
is
easy
to
make
calculations
based
on
probabilities
but
when
contingencies
are
left
out
the
result
mostly
takes
a
very
different
form
to
that
which
it
first
promised
to
assume
helen
had
carefully
watched
his
countenance
while
her
father
spoke
of
flora
wilton
she
had
not
forgotten
how
his
eyes
seemed
to
gloat
on
her
beauty
when
he
beheld
her
in
the
garden
and
she
felt
convinced
by
the
expression
which
passed
over
his
features
when
he
learned
that
miss
wilton
was
of
good
birth
and
rich
that
he
then
formed
designs
respecting
her
a
flush
of
indignation
and
mortification
passed
through
her
frame
will
bring
him
to
my
feet
and
spurn
him
yet
she
said
to
herself
it
was
in
this
spirit
they
were
all
but
toying
with
each
other
when
malcolm
who
had
been
reading
the
uttered
an
exclamation
and
turning
to
his
father
he
said
remember
young
riversdale
sir
you
do
helen
of
course
he
cried
turning
to
his
sister
had
fame
life
depended
upon
an
unchanged
countenance
she
must
have
lost
both
she
on
the
instant
grew
deathly
pale
she
could
not
reply
she
merely
bent
her
head
son
of
major
riversdale
said
grahame
think
we
met
them
in
the
north
returned
malcolm
i
remember
his
father
died
a
beggar
and
his
uncle
an
east
india
merchant
took
charge
of
him
made
him
a
clerk
or
something
of
that
kind
observed
grahame
person
one
could
not
notice
now
why
did
you
introduce
his
name
to
our
notice
is
a
paragraph
about
him
in
the
it
is
rather
a
strange
affair
read
it
out
replied
malcolm
so
said
his
mother
helen
held
her
breath
she
felt
that
some
dreadful
disclosure
was
about
to
be
made
which
would
overwhelm
her
too
oh
that
she
might
not
faint
if
only
she
did
not
faint
and
could
get
to
her
room
to
wrestle
with
the
trial
for
such
it
must
be
alone
she
sat
with
closed
hands
teeth
her
eyes
only
open
motionless
as
a
statue
malcolm
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
journal
he
held
in
his
hand
and
in
a
loud
clear
voice
read
as
follows
singular
circumstance
attended
the
departure
from
these
shores
of
the
peninsula
and
oriental
steam
ship
the
bearing
the
mails
for
india
and
china
when
off
the
needles
a
young
gentleman
whose
name
was
ascertained
to
be
hugh
riversdale
was
observed
to
be
regarding
the
receding
cliffs
of
england
with
deep
emotion
suddenly
uttering
a
loud
cry
said
by
some
who
heard
it
to
be
the
name
of
a
lady
he
sprang
on
to
the
taffrail
of
the
ship
and
leaped
into
the
sea
fortunately
a
was
standing
off
and
on
waiting
the
arrival
of
an
american
liner
her
crew
had
observed
the
suicidal
act
and
made
most
noble
efforts
to
rescue
the
young
gentleman
their
exertions
were
we
are
happy
to
say
so
far
crowned
with
success
that
they
picked
up
the
body
in
a
lifeless
state
meanwhile
the
engines
of
the
under
the
thrilling
cry
of
man
overboard
had
been
stopped
and
reversed
and
the
crew
of
the
were
thus
enabled
to
convey
the
body
on
board
the
the
most
advisable
course
to
be
pursued
as
the
best
medical
assistance
with
ready
access
to
restoratives
could
be
there
promptly
afforded
we
are
unable
to
state
whether
the
exertions
to
restore
life
were
successful
as
on
the
recovery
of
the
body
the
engines
of
the
steamer
were
set
in
motion
the
crew
of
the
returned
to
their
vessel
and
the
ripon
at
speed
proceeded
on
her
distant
strange
affair
that
concluded
malcolm
laying
down
the
paper
womantic
ha
ha
laughed
the
young
duke
folly
that
to
dwown
oneself
for
love
ha
ha
suddenly
they
were
all
startled
by
a
terrified
cry
bursting
from
the
lips
of
evangeline
she
sprang
from
her
seat
and
twined
her
arms
round
her
eldest
sister
helen
she
cried
dearest
helen
you
are
ill
darling
speak
helen
speak
for
sake
oh
mamma
mamma
pray
come
to
helen
she
is
dying
helen
sat
erect
still
rigid
as
a
stone
statue
and
as
lifeless
she
had
listened
in
a
state
of
feeling
to
the
reading
of
the
paragraph
up
to
a
certain
point
she
heard
the
description
of
emotion
at
the
sight
of
the
diminishing
heights
of
the
land
containing
all
that
he
loved
or
prized
she
knew
that
her
form
her
averted
form
was
at
that
instant
before
his
humid
eyes
she
heard
his
despairing
call
upon
her
name
she
saw
him
suddenly
spring
up
upon
the
edge
and
leap
out
with
a
wild
cry
plunging
down
down
into
the
dreadful
depths
of
the
surging
sea
to
find
that
peaceful
release
from
intense
mental
anguish
which
she
had
selfishly
and
heartlessly
denied
to
him
here
then
all
was
dark
she
sat
motionless
stark
consciousness
departing
from
her
and
leaving
her
without
sense
or
motion
and
grahame
were
disturbed
at
the
undignified
departure
from
the
proprieties
of
life
displayed
by
both
helen
and
evangeline
grahame
especially
was
grieved
to
think
that
the
example
of
icy
immobility
set
on
all
occasions
by
margaret
claverhouse
was
not
followed
by
both
her
sisters
the
bell
was
rung
violently
by
malcolm
who
except
evangeline
displayed
the
most
feeling
of
the
family
chayter
was
summoned
and
helen
accompanied
by
evangeline
was
borne
to
her
apartment
lester
vane
retired
to
the
garden
folding
his
arms
he
paced
the
sinuous
paths
thoughtfully
he
muttered
mystery
is
solved
this
youth
hugh
riversdale
was
my
assailant
in
the
alcove
and
helen
was
his
companion
there
hem
his
merchant
uncle
has
despatched
his
clerk
to
india
he
out
of
his
grief
like
a
mad
fool
leaps
into
the
sea
and
she
swoons
to
hear
of
his
folly
she
is
selfish
but
she
loves
him
and
seeks
to
fool
me
he
struck
me
this

well
she
shall
avenge
the
blow
away
with

of

no

leaned
upon

ran
along
