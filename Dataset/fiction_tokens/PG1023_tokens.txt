preface
a
chancery
judge
once
had
the
kindness
to
inform
me
as
one
of
a
company
of
some
hundred
and
fifty
men
and
women
not
labouring
under
any
suspicions
of
lunacy
that
the
court
of
chancery
though
the
shining
subject
of
much
popular
prejudice
at
which
point
i
thought
the
judge
eye
had
a
cast
in
my
direction
was
almost
immaculate
there
had
been
he
admitted
a
trivial
blemish
or
so
in
its
rate
of
progress
but
this
was
exaggerated
and
had
been
entirely
owing
to
the
parsimony
of
the
public
which
guilty
public
it
appeared
had
been
until
lately
bent
in
the
most
determined
manner
on
by
no
means
enlarging
the
number
of
chancery
judges
appointed
i
believe
by
richard
the
second
but
any
other
king
will
do
as
well
this
seemed
to
me
too
profound
a
joke
to
be
inserted
in
the
body
of
this
book
or
i
should
have
restored
it
to
conversation
kenge
or
to
vholes
with
one
or
other
of
whom
i
think
it
must
have
originated
in
such
mouths
i
might
have
coupled
it
with
an
apt
quotation
from
one
of
shakespeare
sonnets
my
nature
is
subdued
to
what
it
works
in
like
the
dyer
hand
pity
me
then
and
wish
i
were
renewed
but
as
it
is
wholesome
that
the
parsimonious
public
should
know
what
has
been
doing
and
still
is
doing
in
this
connexion
i
mention
here
that
everything
set
forth
in
these
pages
concerning
the
court
of
chancery
is
substantially
true
and
within
the
truth
the
case
of
gridley
is
in
no
essential
altered
from
one
of
actual
occurrence
made
public
by
a
disinterested
person
who
was
professionally
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
monstrous
wrong
from
beginning
to
end
at
the
present
moment
august
there
is
a
suit
before
the
court
which
was
commenced
nearly
twenty
years
ago
in
which
from
thirty
to
forty
counsel
have
been
known
to
appear
at
one
time
in
which
costs
have
been
incurred
to
the
amount
of
seventy
thousand
pounds
which
is
a
friendly
suit
and
which
is
i
am
assured
no
nearer
to
its
termination
now
than
when
it
was
begun
there
is
another
suit
in
chancery
not
yet
decided
which
was
commenced
before
the
close
of
the
last
century
and
in
which
more
than
double
the
amount
of
seventy
thousand
pounds
has
been
swallowed
up
in
costs
if
i
wanted
other
authorities
for
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
i
could
rain
them
on
these
pages
to
the
shame
of
a
parsimonious
public
there
is
only
one
other
point
on
which
i
offer
a
word
of
remark
the
possibility
of
what
is
called
spontaneous
combustion
has
been
denied
since
the
death
of
krook
and
my
good
friend
lewes
quite
mistaken
as
he
soon
found
in
supposing
the
thing
to
have
been
abandoned
by
all
authorities
published
some
ingenious
letters
to
me
at
the
time
when
that
event
was
chronicled
arguing
that
spontaneous
combustion
could
not
possibly
be
i
have
no
need
to
observe
that
i
do
not
wilfully
or
negligently
mislead
my
readers
and
that
before
i
wrote
that
description
i
took
pains
to
investigate
the
subject
there
are
about
thirty
cases
on
record
of
which
the
most
famous
that
of
the
countess
cornelia
de
baudi
cesenate
was
minutely
investigated
and
described
by
giuseppe
bianchini
a
prebendary
of
verona
otherwise
distinguished
in
letters
who
published
an
account
of
it
at
verona
in
which
he
afterwards
republished
at
rome
the
appearances
beyond
all
rational
doubt
observed
in
that
case
are
the
appearances
observed
in
krook
case
the
next
most
famous
instance
happened
at
rheims
six
years
earlier
and
the
historian
in
that
case
is
le
cat
one
of
the
most
renowned
surgeons
produced
by
france
the
subject
was
a
woman
whose
husband
was
ignorantly
convicted
of
having
murdered
her
but
on
solemn
appeal
to
a
higher
court
he
was
acquitted
because
it
was
shown
upon
the
evidence
that
she
had
died
the
death
of
which
this
name
of
spontaneous
combustion
is
given
i
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
add
to
these
notable
facts
and
that
general
reference
to
the
authorities
which
will
be
found
at
page
vol
the
recorded
opinions
and
experiences
of
distinguished
medical
professors
french
english
and
scotch
in
more
modern
days
contenting
myself
with
observing
that
i
shall
not
abandon
the
facts
until
there
shall
have
been
a
considerable
spontaneous
combustion
of
the
testimony
on
which
human
occurrences
are
usually
received
in
bleak
house
i
have
purposely
dwelt
upon
the
romantic
side
of
familiar
things

most

of

sinners
holds
this

on

the

sitting
here
as

is
with
a
foggy
glory
round
his
head
softly
fenced
in
with
crimson
cloth
and
curtains
addressed
by
a
large
advocate
with
great
whiskers
a
little
voice
and
an
interminable
brief
and
outwardly
directing
his
contemplation
to
the
lantern
in
the
roof
where
he
can
see
nothing
but
fog
on
such
an
afternoon
some
score
of
members
of
the
high
court
of

bar
ought
to
be
as
here
they
are
mistily
engaged
in
one
of
the
ten
thousand
stages
of
an
endless
cause
tripping
one
another
up
on
slippery
precedents
groping
in
technicalities
running
their
and
horsehair
warded
heads
against
walls
of
words
and
making
a
pretence
of
equity
with
serious
faces
as
players
might

such
an
afternoon
the
various
solicitors
in
the
cause
some
two
or
three
of
whom
have

from

fortune
by
it

to
be
as

not
ranged
in

might
look
in
vain
for

at
the
bottom

nonsense
piled

there
well
may
the
fog
hang
heavy
in
it
as
if
it
would
never
get
out
well
may
the
windows
lose
their
colour
and
admit
no
light
of

into

may
the
uninitiated
from
the
streets
who
peep
in
through
the
glass
panes
in
the
door
be
deterred
from
entrance
by
its
owlish
aspect
and
by
the
drawl
languidly
echoing
to
the
roof
from
the
padded
dais
where
the
lord
high
chancellor
looks
into
the
lantern
that
has
no
light
in
it

where
the
attendant
wigs
are
all
stuck
in
a
this
is
the
court
of
chancery
which
has
its
decaying
houses
and
its
blighted
lands
in
every
shire
which
has
its
lunatic
in
every
madhouse
and
its
dead
in
every
churchyard
which
has
its
ruined
suitor
with
his
slipshod
heels
and
threadbare
dress
borrowing
and
begging
through
the
round
of
every
man
acquaintance
which
gives
to
monied
might
the
means
abundantly
of
wearying
out
the
right
which
so
exhausts
finances
patience

hope
so
overthrows
the
brain
and
breaks
the
heart
that
there

a
little
mad
old
woman
in

is
always
in

from

sitting

always
expecting

incomprehensible
judgment
to
be
given
in
her
favour

periodically
appears
from

and
breaks
out
into
efforts
to
address
the
chancellor
at
the
close
of
the
day
business
and
who
can
by
no
means
be
made
to
understand
that

is

making
it
desolate

a
quarter
of

century

himself
in

of
sonorous
complaint

scarecrow

of

become
so
complicated
that
no
man
alive
knows
what
it
means
the
parties
to
it
understand
it
least
but
it
has
been
observed
that
no
two
chancery
lawyers
can
talk
about
it
for
five
minutes
without
coming
to
a
total
disagreement
as
to
all
the
premises
innumerable
children
have
been
born
into
the
cause
innumerable
young
people
have
married
into
it
innumerable
old
people
have
died
out
of
it
scores
of
persons
have
deliriously
found
themselves
made
parties
in
jarndyce

without
knowing
how

why
whole

a
long
procession
of
chancellors
has
come
in

gone
out

legion
of
bills
in

been
transformed
into
mere
bills
of
mortality
there
are
not
three
jarndyces
left
upon
the
earth
perhaps
since
old
tom
jarndyce
in
despair
blew
his
brains
out
at
a
in
chancery
lane
but
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
still
drags
its
dreary
length
before
the
court
perennially
hopeless
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
has
passed
into
a
joke
that
is
the
only
good
that
has
ever
come
of
it
it
has
been
death
to
many
but
it
is
a
joke
in
the
profession
every
master
in

has
had
a
reference
out
of
it
every
chancellor
was
in
it
for
somebody
or
other
when
he
was
counsel
at
the
bar
good
things
have
been
said
about
it
by
old
benchers
in
select
committee
after
dinner
in
hall
articled
clerks
have
been
in
the
habit
of
fleshing
their
legal
wit
upon
it
the
last
lord
chancellor
handled
it
neatly
when
correcting
blowers
the
eminent
silk
gown
who
said
that
such
a
thing
might
happen
when
the
sky
rained
potatoes
he
observed
or
when
we
get
through
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
blowers
a
pleasantry
that
particularly
tickled
the
maces
bags
and
purses
how
many
people
out
of
the
suit
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
has
stretched
forth
its
unwholesome
hand
to
spoil
and
corrupt
would
be
a
very
wide
question
from
the
master
upon
whose
impaling
files
reams
of
dusty
warrants
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
have
grimly
writhed
into
many
shapes
down
to
the
in
the
six
clerks
office
who
has
copied
his
tens
of
thousands
of
chancery
under
that
eternal
heading
no
man
nature
has
been
made
better
by
it
in
trickery
evasion
procrastination
spoliation
botheration
under
false
pretences
of
all
sorts
there
are
influences
that
can
never
come
to
good
the
very
solicitors
boys
who
have
kept
the
wretched
suitors
at
bay
by
protesting
time
out
of
mind
that
chizzle
mizzle
or
otherwise
was
particularly
engaged
and
had
appointments
until
dinner
may
have
got
an
extra
moral
twist
and
shuffle
into
themselves
out
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
the
receiver
in
the
cause
has
acquired
a
goodly
sum
of
money
by
it
but
has
acquired
too
a
distrust
of
his
own
mother
and
a
contempt
for
his
own
kind
chizzle
mizzle
and
otherwise
have
lapsed
into
a
habit
of
vaguely
promising
themselves
that
they
will
look
into
that
outstanding
little
matter
and
see
what
can
be
done
for
drizzle
who
was
not
well
used
when
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
shall
be
got
out
of
the
office
shirking
and
sharking
in
all
their
many
varieties
have
been
sown
broadcast
by
the
cause
and
even
those
who
have
contemplated
its
history
from
the
outermost
circle
of
such
evil
have
been
insensibly
tempted
into
a
loose
way
of
letting
bad
things
alone
to
take
their
own
bad
course
and
a
loose
belief
that
if
the
world
go
wrong
it
was
in
some
manner
never
meant
to
go
right
thus
in
the
midst
of
the
mud
and
at
the
heart
of
the
fog
sits
the
lord
high
chancellor
in
his
high
court
of
chancery
tangle
says
the
lord
high
chancellor
latterly
something
restless
under
the
eloquence
of
that
learned
gentleman
mlud
says
tangle
tangle
knows
more
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
than
anybody
he
is
famous
for
it
supposed
never
to
have
read
anything
else
since
he
left
school
have
you
nearly
concluded
your
argument
mlud
no
variety
of
points
feel
it
my
duty
tsubmit
ludship
is
the
reply
that
slides
out
of
tangle
several
members
of
the
bar
are
still
to
be
heard
i
believe
says
the
chancellor
with
a
slight
smile
eighteen
of
tangle
learned
friends
each
armed
with
a
little
summary
of
eighteen
hundred
sheets
bob
up
like
eighteen
hammers
in
a
pianoforte
make
eighteen
bows
and
drop
into
their
eighteen
places
of
obscurity
we
will
proceed
with
the
hearing
on
wednesday
fortnight
says
the
chancellor
for
the
question
at
issue
is
only
a
question
of
costs
a
mere
bud
on
the
forest
tree
of
the
parent
suit
and
really
will
come
to
a
settlement
one
of
these
days
the
chancellor
rises
the
bar
rises
the
prisoner
is
brought
forward
in
a
hurry
the
man
from
shropshire
cries
my
lord
maces
bags
and
purses
indignantly
proclaim
silence
and
frown
at
the
man
from
shropshire
in
reference
proceeds
the
chancellor
still
on
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
to
the
young
girl
begludship
pardon
boy
says
tangle
prematurely
in
reference
proceeds
the
chancellor
with
extra
distinctness
to
the
young
girl
and
boy
the
two
young
people
tangle
crushed
whom
i
directed
to
be
in
attendance
and
who
are
now
in
my
private
room
i
will
see
them
and
satisfy
myself
as
to
the
expediency
of
making
the
order
for
their
residing
with
their
uncle
tangle
on
his
legs
again

with
their
chancellor
looking
through
his
double
at
the

his
desk
grandfather
begludship
pardon
victim
of
rash
action
brains
suddenly
a
very
little
counsel
with
a
terrific
bass
voice
arises
fully
inflated
in
the
back
settlements
of
the
fog
and
says
will
your
lordship
allow
me
i
appear
for
him
he
is
a
cousin
several
times
removed
i
am
not
at
the
moment
prepared
to
inform
the
court
in
what
exact
remove
he
is
a
cousin
but
he
is
a
cousin
leaving
this
address
delivered
like
a
sepulchral
message
ringing
in
the
rafters
of
the
roof
the
very
little
counsel
drops
and
the
fog
knows
him
no
more
everybody
looks
for
him
nobody
can
see
him
i
will
speak
with
both
the
young
people
says
the
chancellor
anew
and
satisfy
myself
on
the
subject
of
their
residing
with
their
cousin
i
will
mention
the
matter
morning
when
i
take
my
seat
the
chancellor
is
about
to
bow
to
the
bar
when
the
prisoner
is
presented
nothing
can
possibly
come
of
the
prisoner
conglomeration
but
his
being
sent
back
to
prison
which
is
soon
done
the
man
from
shropshire
ventures
another
remonstrative
my
lord
but
the
chancellor
being
aware
of
him
has
dexterously
vanished
everybody
else
quickly
vanishes
too
a
battery
of
blue
bags
is
loaded
with
heavy
charges
of
papers
and
carried
off
by
clerks
the
little
mad
old
woman
marches
off
with
her
documents
the
empty
court
is
locked
up
if
all
the
injustice
it
has
committed
and
all
the
misery
it
has
caused
could
only
be
locked
up
with
it
and
the
whole
burnt
away
in
a
great
funeral
pyre
why
so
much
the
better
for
other
parties
than
the
parties
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
chapter
ii
in
fashion
it
is
but
a
glimpse
of
the
world
of
fashion
that
we
want
on
this
same
miry
afternoon
it
is
not
so
unlike
the
court
of
chancery
but
that
we
may
pass
from
the
one
scene
to
the
other
as
the
crow
flies
both
the
world
of
fashion
and
the
court
of
chancery
are
things
of
precedent
and
usage
oversleeping
rip
van
winkles
who
have
played
at
strange
games
through
a
deal
of
thundery
weather
sleeping
beauties
whom
the
knight
will
wake
one
day
when
all
the
stopped
spits
in
the
kitchen
shall
begin
to
turn
prodigiously
it
is
not
a
large
world
relatively
even
to
this
world
of
ours
which
has
its
limits
too
as
your
highness
shall
find
when
you
have
made
the
tour
of
it
and
are
come
to
the
brink
of
the
void
beyond
it
is
a
very
little
speck
there
is
much
good
in
it
there
are
many
good
and
true
people
in
it
it
has
its
appointed
place
but
the
evil
of
it
is
that
it
is
a
world
wrapped
up
in
too
much
jeweller
cotton
and
fine
wool
and
can
not
hear
the
rushing
of
the
larger
worlds
and
can
not
see
them
as
they
circle
round
the
sun
it
is
a
deadened
world
and
its
growth
is
sometimes
unhealthy
for
want
of
air
my
lady
dedlock
has
returned
to
her
house
in
town
for
a
few
days
previous
to
her
departure
for
paris
where
her
ladyship
intends
to
stay
some
weeks
after
which
her
movements
are
uncertain
the
fashionable
intelligence
says
so
for
the
comfort
of
the
parisians
and
it
knows
all
fashionable
things
to
know
things
otherwise
were
to
be
unfashionable
my
lady
dedlock
has
been
down
at
what
she
calls
in
familiar
conversation
her
place
in
lincolnshire
the
waters
are
out
in
lincolnshire
an
arch
of
the
bridge
in
the
park
has
been
sapped
and
sopped
away
the
adjacent
ground
for
half
a
mile
in
breadth
is
a
stagnant
river
with
melancholy
trees
for
islands
in
it
and
a
surface
punctured
all
over
all
day
long
with
falling
rain
my
lady
dedlock
place
has
been
extremely
dreary
the
weather
for
many
a
day
and
night
has
been
so
wet
that
the
trees
seem
wet
through
and
the
soft
loppings
and
prunings
of
the
woodman
axe
can
make
no
crash
or
crackle
as
they
fall
the
deer
looking
soaked
leave
quagmires
where
they
pass
the
shot
of
a
rifle
loses
its
sharpness
in
the
moist
air
and
its
smoke
moves
in
a
tardy
little
cloud
towards
the
green
rise
that
makes
a
background
for
the
falling
rain
the
view
from
my
lady
dedlock
own
windows
is
alternately
a
view
and
a
view
in
indian
ink
the
vases
on
the
stone
terrace
in
the
foreground
catch
the
rain
all
day
and
the
heavy
drops
fall
drip
drip
drip
upon
the
broad
flagged
pavement
called
from
old
time
the
ghost
walk
all
night
on
sundays
the
little
church
in
the
park
is
mouldy
the
oaken
pulpit
breaks
out
into
a
cold
sweat
and
there
is
a
general
smell
and
taste
as
of
the
ancient
dedlocks
in
their
graves
my
lady
dedlock
who
is
childless
looking
out
in
the
early
twilight
from
her
boudoir
at
a
keeper
lodge
and
seeing
the
light
of
a
fire
upon
the
latticed
panes
and
smoke
rising
from
the
chimney
and
a
child
chased
by
a
woman
running
out
into
the
rain
to
meet
the
shining
figure
of
a
man
coming
through
the
gate
has
been
put
quite
out
of
temper
my
lady
dedlock
says
she
has
been
bored
to
death
therefore
my
lady
dedlock
has
come
away
from
the
place
in
lincolnshire
and
has
left
it
to
the
rain
and
the
crows
and
the
rabbits
and
the
deer
and
the
partridges
and
pheasants
the
pictures
of
the
dedlocks
past
and
gone
have
seemed
to
vanish
into
the
damp
walls
in
mere
lowness
of
spirits
as
the
housekeeper
has
passed
along
the
old
rooms
shutting
up
the
shutters
and
when
they
will
next
come
forth
again
the
fashionable
intelligence
which
like
the
fiend
is
omniscient
of
the
past
and
present
but
not
the
future
can
not
yet
undertake
to
say
sir
leicester
dedlock
is
only
a
baronet
but
there
is
no
mightier
baronet
than
he
his
family
is
as
old
as
the
hills
and
infinitely
more
respectable
he
has
a
general
opinion
that
the
world
might
get
on
without
hills
but
would
be
done
up
without
dedlocks
he
would
on
the
whole
admit
nature
to
be
a
good
idea
a
little
low
perhaps
when
not
enclosed
with
a
but
an
idea
dependent
for
its
execution
on
your
great
county
families
he
is
a
gentleman
of
strict
conscience
disdainful
of
all
littleness
and
meanness
and
ready
on
the
shortest
notice
to
die
any
death
you
may
please
to
mention
rather
than
give
occasion
for
the
least
impeachment
of
his
integrity
he
is
an
honourable
obstinate
truthful
intensely
prejudiced
perfectly
unreasonable
man
sir
leicester
is
twenty
years
full
measure
older
than
my
lady
he
will
never
see
again
nor
perhaps
nor
yet
he
has
a
twist
of
the
gout
now
and
then
and
walks
a
little
stiffly
he
is
of
a
worthy
presence
with
his
hair
and
whiskers
his
fine
his
waistcoat
and
his
blue
coat
with
bright
buttons
always
buttoned
he
is
ceremonious
stately
most
polite
on
every
occasion
to
my
lady
and
holds
her
personal
attractions
in
the
highest
estimation
his
gallantry
to
my
lady
which
has
never
changed
since
he
courted
her
is
the
one
little
touch
of
romantic
fancy
in
him
indeed
he
married
her
for
love
a
whisper
still
goes
about
that
she
had
not
even
family
howbeit
sir
leicester
had
so
much
family
that
perhaps
he
had
enough
and
could
dispense
with
any
more
but
she
had
beauty
pride
ambition
insolent
resolve
and
sense
enough
to
portion
out
a
legion
of
fine
ladies
wealth
and
station
added
to
these
soon
floated
her
upward
and
for
years
now
my
lady
dedlock
has
been
at
the
centre
of
the
fashionable
intelligence
and
at
the
top
of
the
fashionable
tree
how
alexander
wept
when
he
had
no
more
worlds
to
conquer
everybody
knows
or
has
some
reason
to
know
by
this
time
the
matter
having
been
rather
frequently
mentioned
my
lady
dedlock
having
conquered
her
world
fell
not
into
the
melting
but
rather
into
the
freezing
mood
an
exhausted
composure
a
placidity
an
equanimity
of
fatigue
not
to
be
ruffled
by
interest
or
satisfaction
are
the
trophies
of
her
victory
she
is
perfectly
if
she
could
be
translated
to
heaven
she
might
be
expected
to
ascend
without
any
rapture
she
has
beauty
still
and
if
it
be
not
in
its
heyday
it
is
not
yet
in
its
autumn
she
has
a
fine
face
originally
of
a
character
that
would
be
rather
called
very
pretty
than
handsome
but
improved
into
classicality
by
the
acquired
expression
of
her
fashionable
state
her
figure
is
elegant
and
has
the
effect
of
being
tall
not
that
she
is
so
but
that
the
most
is
made
as
the
honourable
bob
stables
has
frequently
asserted
upon
oath
of
all
her
points
the
same
authority
observes
that
she
is
perfectly
got
up
and
remarks
in
commendation
of
her
hair
especially
that
she
is
the
woman
in
the
whole
stud
with
all
her
perfections
on
her
head
my
lady
dedlock
has
come
up
from
her
place
in
lincolnshire
hotly
pursued
by
the
fashionable
intelligence
to
pass
a
few
days
at
her
house
in
town
previous
to
her
departure
for
paris
where
her
ladyship
intends
to
stay
some
weeks
after
which
her
movements
are
uncertain
and
at
her
house
in
town
upon
this
muddy
murky
afternoon
presents
himself
an
old
gentleman
and
eke
solicitor
of
the
high
court
of
chancery
who
has
the
honour
of
acting
as
legal
adviser
of
the
dedlocks
and
has
as
many
boxes
in
his
office
with
that
name
outside
as
if
the
present
baronet
were
the
coin
of
the
trick
and
were
constantly
being
juggled
through
the
whole
set
across
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
and
along
the
passages
and
through
the
rooms
which
are
very
brilliant
in
the
season
and
very
dismal
out
of
it
to
visit
but
a
desert
to
live
in
the
old
gentleman
is
conducted
by
a
mercury
in
powder
to
my
lady
presence
the
old
gentleman
is
rusty
to
look
at
but
is
reputed
to
have
made
good
thrift
out
of
aristocratic
marriage
settlements
and
aristocratic
wills
and
to
be
very
rich
he
is
surrounded
by
a
mysterious
halo
of
family
confidences
of
which
he
is
known
to
be
the
silent
depository
there
are
noble
mausoleums
rooted
for
centuries
in
retired
glades
of
parks
among
the
growing
timber
and
the
fern
which
perhaps
hold
fewer
noble
secrets
than
walk
abroad
among
men
shut
up
in
the
breast
of
tulkinghorn
he
is
of
what
is
called
the
old
school
a
phrase
generally
meaning
any
school
that
seems
never
to
have
been
young
and
wears
tied
with
ribbons
and
gaiters
or
stockings
one
peculiarity
of
his
black
clothes
and
of
his
black
stockings
be
they
silk
or
worsted
is
that
they
never
shine
mute
close
irresponsive
to
any
glancing
light
his
dress
is
like
himself
he
never
converses
when
not
professionally
consulted
he
is
found
sometimes
speechless
but
quite
at
home
at
corners
of
in
great
country
houses
and
near
doors
of
concerning
which
the
fashionable
intelligence
is
eloquent
where
everybody
knows
him
and
where
half
the
peerage
stops
to
say
how
do
you
do
mr
tulkinghorn
he
receives
these
salutations
with
gravity
and
buries
them
along
with
the
rest
of
his
knowledge
sir
leicester
dedlock
is
with
my
lady
and
is
happy
to
see
tulkinghorn
there
is
an
air
of
prescription
about
him
which
is
always
agreeable
to
sir
leicester
he
receives
it
as
a
kind
of
tribute
he
likes
tulkinghorn
dress
there
is
a
kind
of
tribute
in
that
too
it
is
eminently
respectable
and
likewise
in
a
general
way
it
expresses
as
it
were
the
steward
of
the
legal
mysteries
the
butler
of
the
legal
cellar
of
the
dedlocks
has
tulkinghorn
any
idea
of
this
himself
it
may
be
so
or
it
may
not
but
there
is
this
remarkable
circumstance
to
be
noted
in
everything
associated
with
my
lady
dedlock
as
one
of
a
class
as
one
of
the
leaders
and
representatives
of
her
little
world
she
supposes
herself
to
be
an
inscrutable
being
quite
out
of
the
reach
and
ken
of
ordinary
mortals
seeing
herself
in
her
glass
where
indeed
she
looks
so
yet
every
dim
little
star
revolving
about
her
from
her
maid
to
the
manager
of
the
italian
opera
knows
her
weaknesses
prejudices
follies
haughtinesses
and
caprices
and
lives
upon
as
accurate
a
calculation
and
as
nice
a
measure
of
her
moral
nature
as
her
dressmaker
takes
of
her
physical
proportions
is
a
new
dress
a
new
custom
a
new
singer
a
new
dancer
a
new
form
of
jewellery
a
new
dwarf
or
giant
a
new
chapel
a
new
anything
to
be
set
up
there
are
deferential
people
in
a
dozen
callings
whom
my
lady
dedlock
suspects
of
nothing
but
prostration
before
her
who
can
tell
you
how
to
manage
her
as
if
she
were
a
baby
who
do
nothing
but
nurse
her
all
their
lives
who
humbly
affecting
to
follow
with
profound
subservience
lead
her
and
her
whole
troop
after
them
who
in
hooking
one
hook
all
and
bear
them
off
as
lemuel
gulliver
bore
away
the
stately
fleet
of
the
majestic
lilliput
if
you
want
to
address
our
people
sir
say
blaze
and
sparkle
the
jewellers
meaning
by
our
people
lady
dedlock
and
the
rest
you
must
remember
that
you
are
not
dealing
with
the
general
public
you
must
hit
our
people
in
their
weakest
place
and
their
weakest
place
is
such
a
place
to
make
this
article
go
down
gentlemen
say
sheen
and
gloss
the
mercers
to
their
friends
the
manufacturers
you
must
come
to
us
because
we
know
where
to
have
the
fashionable
people
and
we
can
make
it
fashionable
if
you
want
to
get
this
print
upon
the
tables
of
my
high
connexion
sir
says
sladdery
the
librarian
or
if
you
want
to
get
this
dwarf
or
giant
into
the
houses
of
my
high
connexion
sir
or
if
you
want
to
secure
to
this
entertainment
the
patronage
of
my
high
connexion
sir
you
must
leave
it
if
you
please
to
me
for
i
have
been
accustomed
to
study
the
leaders
of
my
high
connexion
sir
and
i
may
tell
you
without
vanity
that
i
can
turn
them
round
my
finger
in
which
sladdery
who
is
an
honest
man
does
not
exaggerate
at
all
therefore
while
tulkinghorn
may
not
know
what
is
passing
in
the
dedlock
mind
at
present
it
is
very
possible
that
he
may
my
lady
cause
has
been
again
before
the
chancellor
has
it
mr
tulkinghorn
says
sir
leicester
giving
him
his
hand
yes
it
has
been
on
again
tulkinghorn
replies
making
one
of
his
quiet
bows
to
my
lady
who
is
on
a
sofa
near
the
fire
shading
her
face
with
a
it
would
be
useless
to
ask
says
my
lady
with
the
dreariness
of
the
place
in
lincolnshire
still
upon
her
whether
anything
has
been
done
nothing
that
you
would
call
anything
has
been
done
replies
tulkinghorn
nor
ever
will
be
says
my
lady
sir
leicester
has
no
objection
to
an
interminable
chancery
suit
it
is
a
slow
expensive
british
constitutional
kind
of
thing
to
be
sure
he
has
not
a
vital
interest
in
the
suit
in
question
her
part
in
which
was
the
only
property
my
lady
brought
him
and
he
has
a
shadowy
impression
that
for
his
name
the
name
of
dedlock
to
be
in
a
cause
and
not
in
the
title
of
that
cause
is
a
most
ridiculous
accident
but
he
regards
the
court
of
chancery
even
if
it
should
involve
an
occasional
delay
of
justice
and
a
trifling
amount
of
confusion
as
a
something
devised
in
conjunction
with
a
variety
of
other
somethings
by
the
perfection
of
human
wisdom
for
the
eternal
settlement
humanly
speaking
of
everything
and
he
is
upon
the
whole
of
a
fixed
opinion
that
to
give
the
sanction
of
his
countenance
to
any
complaints
respecting
it
would
be
to
encourage
some
person
in
the
lower
classes
to
rise
up
somewhere
like
wat
tyler
as
a
few
fresh
affidavits
have
been
put
upon
the
file
says
tulkinghorn
and
as
they
are
short
and
as
i
proceed
upon
the
troublesome
principle
of
begging
leave
to
possess
my
clients
with
any
new
proceedings
in
a
cause
cautious
man
tulkinghorn
taking
no
more
responsibility
than
necessary
and
further
as
i
see
you
are
going
to
paris
i
have
brought
them
in
my
pocket
sir
leicester
was
going
to
paris
too
by
the
by
but
the
delight
of
the
fashionable
intelligence
was
in
his
lady
tulkinghorn
takes
out
his
papers
asks
permission
to
place
them
on
a
golden
talisman
of
a
table
at
my
lady
elbow
puts
on
his
spectacles
and
begins
to
read
by
the
light
of
a
shaded
lamp
chancery
between
john
jarndyce
my
lady
interrupts
requesting
him
to
miss
as
many
of
the
formal
horrors
as
he
can
tulkinghorn
glances
over
his
spectacles
and
begins
again
lower
down
my
lady
carelessly
and
scornfully
abstracts
her
attention
sir
leicester
in
a
great
chair
looks
at
the
file
and
appears
to
have
a
stately
liking
for
the
legal
repetitions
and
prolixities
as
ranging
among
the
national
bulwarks
it
happens
that
the
fire
is
hot
where
my
lady
sits
and
that
the
is
more
beautiful
than
useful
being
priceless
but
small
my
lady
changing
her
position
sees
the
papers
on
the
table
looks
at
them
nearer
looks
at
them
nearer
still
asks
impulsively
who
copied
that
tulkinghorn
stops
short
surprised
by
my
lady
animation
and
her
unusual
tone
is
it
what
you
people
call
she
asks
looking
full
at
him
in
her
careless
way
again
and
toying
with
her
screen
not
quite
probably
tulkinghorn
examines
it
as
he
speaks
the
legal
character
which
it
has
was
acquired
after
the
original
hand
was
formed
why
do
you
ask
anything
to
vary
this
detestable
monotony
oh
go
on
do
tulkinghorn
reads
again
the
heat
is
greater
my
lady
screens
her
face
sir
leicester
dozes
starts
up
suddenly
and
cries
eh
what
do
you
say
i
say
i
am
afraid
says
tulkinghorn
who
had
risen
hastily
that
lady
dedlock
is
faint
my
lady
murmurs
with
white
lips
only
that
but
it
is
like
the
faintness
of
death
do
speak
to
me
ring
and
take
me
to
my
room
tulkinghorn
retires
into
another
chamber
bells
ring
feet
shuffle
and
patter
silence
ensues
mercury
at
last
begs
tulkinghorn
to
return
better
now
quoth
sir
leicester
motioning
the
lawyer
to
sit
down
and
read
to
him
alone
i
have
been
quite
alarmed
i
never
knew
my
lady
swoon
before
but
the
weather
is
extremely
trying
and
she
really
has
been
bored
to
death
down
at
our
place
in
lincolnshire
chapter
iii
a
progress
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
beginning
to
write
my
portion
of
these
pages
for
i
know
i
am
not
clever
i
always
knew
that
i
can
remember
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
indeed
i
used
to
say
to
my
doll
when
we
were
alone
together
now
dolly
i
am
not
clever
you
know
very
well
and
you
must
be
patient
with
me
like
a
dear
and
so
she
used
to
sit
propped
up
in
a
great
with
her
beautiful
complexion
and
rosy
lips
staring
at
me
or
not
so
much
at
me
i
think
as
at
nothing
while
i
busily
stitched
away
and
told
her
every
one
of
my
secrets
my
dear
old
doll
i
was
such
a
shy
little
thing
that
i
seldom
dared
to
open
my
lips
and
never
dared
to
open
my
heart
to
anybody
else
it
almost
makes
me
cry
to
think
what
a
relief
it
used
to
be
to
me
when
i
came
home
from
school
of
a
day
to
run
upstairs
to
my
room
and
say
oh
you
dear
faithful
dolly
i
knew
you
would
be
expecting
me
and
then
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
leaning
on
the
elbow
of
her
great
chair
and
tell
her
all
i
had
noticed
since
we
parted
i
had
always
rather
a
noticing
way
not
a
quick
way
oh
no
a
silent
way
of
noticing
what
passed
before
me
and
thinking
i
should
like
to
understand
it
better
i
have
not
by
any
means
a
quick
understanding
when
i
love
a
person
very
tenderly
indeed
it
seems
to
brighten
but
even
that
may
be
my
vanity
i
was
brought
up
from
my
earliest
remembrance
like
some
of
the
princesses
in
the
fairy
stories
only
i
was
not
charming
by
my
godmother
at
least
i
only
knew
her
as
such
she
was
a
good
good
woman
she
went
to
church
three
times
every
sunday
and
to
morning
prayers
on
wednesdays
and
fridays
and
to
lectures
whenever
there
were
lectures
and
never
missed
she
was
handsome
and
if
she
had
ever
smiled
would
have
been
i
used
to
think
like
an
angel
but
she
never
smiled
she
was
always
grave
and
strict
she
was
so
very
good
herself
i
thought
that
the
badness
of
other
people
made
her
frown
all
her
life
i
felt
so
different
from
her
even
making
every
allowance
for
the
differences
between
a
child
and
a
woman
i
felt
so
poor
so
trifling
and
so
far
off
that
i
never
could
be
unrestrained
with
her
no
could
never
even
love
her
as
i
wished
it
made
me
very
sorry
to
consider
how
good
she
was
and
how
unworthy
of
her
i
was
and
i
used
ardently
to
hope
that
i
might
have
a
better
heart
and
i
talked
it
over
very
often
with
the
dear
old
doll
but
i
never
loved
my
godmother
as
i
ought
to
have
loved
her
and
as
i
felt
i
must
have
loved
her
if
i
had
been
a
better
girl
this
made
me
i
dare
say
more
timid
and
retiring
than
i
naturally
was
and
cast
me
upon
dolly
as
the
only
friend
with
whom
i
felt
at
ease
but
something
happened
when
i
was
still
quite
a
little
thing
that
helped
it
very
much
i
had
never
heard
my
mama
spoken
of
i
had
never
heard
of
my
papa
either
but
i
felt
more
interested
about
my
mama
i
had
never
worn
a
black
frock
that
i
could
recollect
i
had
never
been
shown
my
grave
i
had
never
been
told
where
it
was
yet
i
had
never
been
taught
to
pray
for
any
relation
but
my
godmother
i
had
more
than
once
approached
this
subject
of
my
thoughts
with
rachael
our
only
servant
who
took
my
light
away
when
i
was
in
bed
another
very
good
woman
but
austere
to
me
and
she
had
only
said
esther
good
night
and
gone
away
and
left
me
although
there
were
seven
girls
at
the
neighbouring
school
where
i
was
a
day
boarder
and
although
they
called
me
little
esther
summerson
i
knew
none
of
them
at
home
all
of
them
were
older
than
i
to
be
sure
i
was
the
youngest
there
by
a
good
deal
but
there
seemed
to
be
some
other
separation
between
us
besides
that
and
besides
their
being
far
more
clever
than
i
was
and
knowing
much
more
than
i
did
one
of
them
in
the
first
week
of
my
going
to
the
school
i
remember
it
very
well
invited
me
home
to
a
little
party
to
my
great
joy
but
my
godmother
wrote
a
stiff
letter
declining
for
me
and
i
never
went
i
never
went
out
at
all
it
was
my
birthday
there
were
holidays
at
school
on
other
birthdays
none
on
mine
there
were
rejoicings
at
home
on
other
birthdays
as
i
knew
from
what
i
heard
the
girls
relate
to
one
another
there
were
none
on
mine
my
birthday
was
the
most
melancholy
day
at
home
in
the
whole
year
i
have
mentioned
that
unless
my
vanity
should
deceive
me
as
i
know
it
may
for
i
may
be
very
vain
without
suspecting
it
though
indeed
i
do
my
comprehension
is
quickened
when
my
affection
is
my
disposition
is
very
affectionate
and
perhaps
i
might
still
feel
such
a
wound
if
such
a
wound
could
be
received
more
than
once
with
the
quickness
of
that
birthday
dinner
was
over
and
my
godmother
and
i
were
sitting
at
the
table
before
the
fire
the
clock
ticked
the
fire
clicked
not
another
sound
had
been
heard
in
the
room
or
in
the
house
for
i
do
know
how
long
i
happened
to
look
timidly
up
from
my
stitching
across
the
table
at
my
godmother
and
i
saw
in
her
face
looking
gloomily
at
me
it
would
have
been
far
better
little
esther
that
you
had
had
no
birthday
that
you
had
never
been
born
i
broke
out
crying
and
sobbing
and
i
said
oh
dear
godmother
tell
me
pray
do
tell
me
did
mama
die
on
my
birthday
no
she
returned
ask
me
no
more
child
oh
do
pray
tell
me
something
of
her
do
now
at
last
dear
godmother
if
you
please
what
did
i
do
to
her
how
did
i
lose
her
why
am
i
so
different
from
other
children
and
why
is
it
my
fault
dear
godmother
no
no
no
do
go
away
oh
speak
to
me
i
was
in
a
kind
of
fright
beyond
my
grief
and
i
caught
hold
of
her
dress
and
was
kneeling
to
her
she
had
been
saying
all
the
while
let
me
go
but
now
she
stood
still
her
darkened
face
had
such
power
over
me
that
it
stopped
me
in
the
midst
of
my
vehemence
i
put
up
my
trembling
little
hand
to
clasp
hers
or
to
beg
her
pardon
with
what
earnestness
i
might
but
withdrew
it
as
she
looked
at
me
and
laid
it
on
my
fluttering
heart
she
raised
me
sat
in
her
chair
and
standing
me
before
her
said
slowly
in
a
cold
low
voice
i
see
her
knitted
brow
and
pointed
finger
your
mother
esther
is
your
disgrace
and
you
were
hers
the
time
will
come
and
soon
enough
when
you
will
understand
this
better
and
will
feel
it
too
as
no
one
save
a
woman
can
i
have
forgiven
her
but
her
face
did
not
relent
the
wrong
she
did
to
me
and
i
say
no
more
of
it
though
it
was
greater
than
you
will
ever
know
than
any
one
will
ever
know
but
i
the
sufferer
for
yourself
unfortunate
girl
orphaned
and
degraded
from
the
first
of
these
evil
anniversaries
pray
daily
that
the
sins
of
others
be
not
visited
upon
your
head
according
to
what
is
written
forget
your
mother
and
leave
all
other
people
to
forget
her
who
will
do
her
unhappy
child
that
greatest
kindness
now
go
she
checked
me
however
as
i
was
about
to
depart
from
her
so
frozen
as
i
was
and
added
this
submission
diligent
work
are
the
preparations
for
a
life
begun
with
such
a
shadow
on
it
you
are
different
from
other
children
esther
because
you
were
not
born
like
them
in
common
sinfulness
and
wrath
you
are
set
apart
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
crept
to
bed
and
laid
my
doll
cheek
against
mine
wet
with
tears
and
holding
that
solitary
friend
upon
my
bosom
cried
myself
to
sleep
imperfect
as
my
understanding
of
my
sorrow
was
i
knew
that
i
had
brought
no
joy
at
any
time
to
heart
and
that
i
was
to
no
one
upon
earth
what
dolly
was
to
me
dear
dear
to
think
how
much
time
we
passed
alone
together
afterwards
and
how
often
i
repeated
to
the
doll
the
story
of
my
birthday
and
confided
to
her
that
i
would
try
as
hard
as
ever
i
could
to
repair
the
fault
i
had
been
born
with
of
which
i
confessedly
felt
guilty
and
yet
innocent
and
would
strive
as
i
grew
up
to
be
industrious
contented
and
and
to
do
some
good
to
some
one
and
win
some
love
to
myself
if
i
could
i
hope
it
is
not
to
shed
these
tears
as
i
think
of
it
i
am
very
thankful
i
am
very
cheerful
but
i
can
not
quite
help
their
coming
to
my
eyes
there
i
have
wiped
them
away
now
and
can
go
on
again
properly
i
felt
the
distance
between
my
godmother
and
myself
so
much
more
after
the
birthday
and
felt
so
sensible
of
filling
a
place
in
her
house
which
ought
to
have
been
empty
that
i
found
her
more
difficult
of
approach
though
i
was
fervently
grateful
to
her
in
my
heart
than
ever
i
felt
in
the
same
way
towards
my
school
companions
i
felt
in
the
same
way
towards
rachael
who
was
a
widow
and
oh
towards
her
daughter
of
whom
she
was
proud
who
came
to
see
her
once
a
fortnight
i
was
very
retired
and
quiet
and
tried
to
be
very
diligent
one
sunny
afternoon
when
i
had
come
home
from
school
with
my
books
and
portfolio
watching
my
long
shadow
at
my
side
and
as
i
was
gliding
upstairs
to
my
room
as
usual
my
godmother
looked
out
of
the
and
called
me
back
sitting
with
her
i
found
which
was
very
unusual
indeed
a
stranger
a
portly
gentleman
dressed
all
in
black
with
a
white
cravat
large
gold
watch
seals
a
pair
of
gold
and
a
large
upon
his
little
finger
this
said
my
godmother
in
an
undertone
is
the
child
then
she
said
in
her
naturally
stern
way
of
speaking
this
is
esther
sir
the
gentleman
put
up
his
to
look
at
me
and
said
come
here
my
dear
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
asked
me
to
take
off
my
bonnet
looking
at
me
all
the
while
when
i
had
complied
he
said
ah
and
afterwards
yes
and
then
taking
off
his
and
folding
them
in
a
red
case
and
leaning
back
in
his
turning
the
case
about
in
his
two
hands
he
gave
my
godmother
a
nod
upon
that
my
godmother
said
you
may
go
upstairs
esther
and
i
made
him
my
curtsy
and
left
him
it
must
have
been
two
years
afterwards
and
i
was
almost
fourteen
when
one
dreadful
night
my
godmother
and
i
sat
at
the
fireside
i
was
reading
aloud
and
she
was
listening
i
had
come
down
at
nine
as
i
always
did
to
read
the
bible
to
her
and
was
reading
from
john
how
our
saviour
stooped
down
writing
with
his
finger
in
the
dust
when
they
brought
the
sinful
woman
to
him
so
when
they
continued
asking
him
he
lifted
up
himself
and
said
unto
them
that
is
without
sin
among
you
let
him
first
cast
a
stone
at
her
i
was
stopped
by
my
godmother
rising
putting
her
hand
to
her
head
and
crying
out
in
an
awful
voice
from
quite
another
part
of
the
book
ye
therefore
lest
coming
suddenly
he
find
you
sleeping
and
what
i
say
unto
you
i
say
unto
all
watch
in
an
instant
while
she
stood
before
me
repeating
these
words
she
fell
down
on
the
floor
i
had
no
need
to
cry
out
her
voice
had
sounded
through
the
house
and
been
heard
in
the
street
she
was
laid
upon
her
bed
for
more
than
a
week
she
lay
there
little
altered
outwardly
with
her
old
handsome
resolute
frown
that
i
so
well
knew
carved
upon
her
face
many
and
many
a
time
in
the
day
and
in
the
night
with
my
head
upon
the
pillow
by
her
that
my
whispers
might
be
plainer
to
her
i
kissed
her
thanked
her
prayed
for
her
asked
her
for
her
blessing
and
forgiveness
entreated
her
to
give
me
the
least
sign
that
she
knew
or
heard
me
no
no
no
her
face
was
immovable
to
the
very
last
and
even
afterwards
her
frown
remained
unsoftened
on
the
day
after
my
poor
good
godmother
was
buried
the
gentleman
in
black
with
the
white
neckcloth
reappeared
i
was
sent
for
by
rachael
and
found
him
in
the
same
place
as
if
he
had
never
gone
away
my
name
is
kenge
he
said
you
may
remember
it
my
child
kenge
and
carboy
lincoln
inn
i
replied
that
i
remembered
to
have
seen
him
once
before
pray
be
seated
here
near
me
do
distress
yourself
it
of
no
use
rachael
i
need
inform
you
who
were
acquainted
with
the
late
miss
barbary
affairs
that
her
means
die
with
her
and
that
this
young
lady
now
her
aunt
is
dead
my
aunt
sir
it
is
really
of
no
use
carrying
on
a
deception
when
no
object
is
to
be
gained
by
it
said
kenge
smoothly
aunt
in
fact
though
not
in
law
do
distress
yourself
do
weep
do
tremble
rachael
our
young
friend
has
no
doubt
heard
of
the
a
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
never
said
rachael
is
it
possible
pursued
kenge
putting
up
his
that
our
young
friend
i
beg
you
wo
distress
yourself
never
heard
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
i
shook
my
head
wondering
even
what
it
was
not
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
said
kenge
looking
over
his
glasses
at
me
and
softly
turning
the
case
about
and
about
as
if
he
were
petting
something
not
of
one
of
the
greatest
chancery
suits
known
not
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
the
a
in
itself
a
monument
of
chancery
practice
in
which
i
would
say
every
difficulty
every
contingency
every
masterly
fiction
every
form
of
procedure
known
in
that
court
is
represented
over
and
over
again
it
is
a
cause
that
could
not
exist
out
of
this
free
and
great
country
i
should
say
that
the
aggregate
of
costs
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
rachael
i
was
afraid
he
addressed
himself
to
her
because
i
appeared
inattentive
amounts
at
the
present
hour
to
from
to
thousand
pounds
said
kenge
leaning
back
in
his
chair
i
felt
very
ignorant
but
what
could
i
do
i
was
so
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
subject
that
i
understood
nothing
about
it
even
then
and
she
really
never
heard
of
the
cause
said
kenge
surprising
miss
barbary
sir
returned
rachael
who
is
now
among
the
seraphim
i
hope
so
i
am
sure
said
kenge
wished
esther
only
to
know
what
would
be
serviceable
to
her
and
she
knows
from
any
teaching
she
has
had
here
nothing
more
well
said
kenge
upon
the
whole
very
proper
now
to
the
point
addressing
me
miss
barbary
your
sole
relation
in
fact
that
is
for
i
am
bound
to
observe
that
in
law
you
had
none
being
deceased
and
it
naturally
not
being
to
be
expected
that
rachael
oh
dear
no
said
rachael
quickly
quite
so
assented
kenge
that
rachael
should
charge
herself
with
your
maintenance
and
support
i
beg
you
wo
distress
yourself
you
are
in
a
position
to
receive
the
renewal
of
an
offer
which
i
was
instructed
to
make
to
miss
barbary
some
two
years
ago
and
which
though
rejected
then
was
understood
to
be
renewable
under
the
lamentable
circumstances
that
have
since
occurred
now
if
i
avow
that
i
represent
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
and
otherwise
a
highly
humane
but
at
the
same
time
singular
man
shall
i
compromise
myself
by
any
stretch
of
my
professional
caution
said
kenge
leaning
back
in
his
chair
again
and
looking
calmly
at
us
both
he
appeared
to
enjoy
beyond
everything
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
i
could
wonder
at
that
for
it
was
mellow
and
full
and
gave
great
importance
to
every
word
he
uttered
he
listened
to
himself
with
obvious
satisfaction
and
sometimes
gently
beat
time
to
his
own
music
with
his
head
or
rounded
a
sentence
with
his
hand
i
was
very
much
impressed
by
him
even
then
before
i
knew
that
he
formed
himself
on
the
model
of
a
great
lord
who
was
his
client
and
that
he
was
generally
called
conversation
kenge
jarndyce
he
pursued
being
aware
of
the
i
would
say
desolate
position
of
our
young
friend
offers
to
place
her
at
a
establishment
where
her
education
shall
be
completed
where
her
comfort
shall
be
secured
where
her
reasonable
wants
shall
be
anticipated
where
she
shall
be
eminently
qualified
to
discharge
her
duty
in
that
station
of
life
unto
which
it
has
pleased
shall
i
say
providence
to
call
her
my
heart
was
filled
so
full
both
by
what
he
said
and
by
his
affecting
manner
of
saying
it
that
i
was
not
able
to
speak
though
i
tried
jarndyce
he
went
on
makes
no
condition
beyond
expressing
his
expectation
that
our
young
friend
will
not
at
any
time
remove
herself
from
the
establishment
in
question
without
his
knowledge
and
concurrence
that
she
will
faithfully
apply
herself
to
the
acquisition
of
those
accomplishments
upon
the
exercise
of
which
she
will
be
ultimately
dependent
that
she
will
tread
in
the
paths
of
virtue
and
honour
and
the
a
so
forth
i
was
still
less
able
to
speak
than
before
now
what
does
our
young
friend
say
proceeded
kenge
take
time
take
time
i
pause
for
her
reply
but
take
time
what
the
destitute
subject
of
such
an
offer
tried
to
say
i
need
not
repeat
what
she
did
say
i
could
more
easily
tell
if
it
were
worth
the
telling
what
she
felt
and
will
feel
to
her
dying
hour
i
could
never
relate
this
interview
took
place
at
windsor
where
i
had
passed
as
far
as
i
knew
my
whole
life
on
that
day
week
amply
provided
with
all
necessaries
i
left
it
inside
the
stagecoach
for
reading
rachael
was
too
good
to
feel
any
emotion
at
parting
but
i
was
not
so
good
and
wept
bitterly
i
thought
that
i
ought
to
have
known
her
better
after
so
many
years
and
ought
to
have
made
myself
enough
of
a
favourite
with
her
to
make
her
sorry
then
when
she
gave
me
one
cold
parting
kiss
upon
my
forehead
like
a
from
the
stone
porch
it
was
a
very
frosty
day
i
felt
so
miserable
and
that
i
clung
to
her
and
told
her
it
was
my
fault
i
knew
that
she
could
say
so
easily
no
esther
she
returned
it
is
your
misfortune
the
coach
was
at
the
little
we
had
not
come
out
until
we
heard
the
wheels
and
thus
i
left
her
with
a
sorrowful
heart
she
went
in
before
my
boxes
were
lifted
to
the
and
shut
the
door
as
long
as
i
could
see
the
house
i
looked
back
at
it
from
the
window
through
my
tears
my
godmother
had
left
rachael
all
the
little
property
she
possessed
and
there
was
to
be
a
sale
and
an
old
with
roses
on
it
which
always
seemed
to
me
the
first
thing
in
the
world
i
had
ever
seen
was
hanging
outside
in
the
frost
and
snow
a
day
or
two
before
i
had
wrapped
the
dear
old
doll
in
her
own
shawl
and
quietly
laid
her
i
am
half
ashamed
to
tell
it
in
the
under
the
tree
that
shaded
my
old
window
i
had
no
companion
left
but
my
bird
and
him
i
carried
with
me
in
his
cage
when
the
house
was
out
of
sight
i
sat
with
my
in
the
straw
at
my
feet
forward
on
the
low
seat
to
look
out
of
the
high
window
watching
the
frosty
trees
that
were
like
beautiful
pieces
of
spar
and
the
fields
all
smooth
and
white
with
last
night
snow
and
the
sun
so
red
but
yielding
so
little
heat
and
the
ice
dark
like
metal
where
the
skaters
and
sliders
had
brushed
the
snow
away
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
coach
who
sat
on
the
opposite
seat
and
looked
very
large
in
a
quantity
of
wrappings
but
he
sat
gazing
out
of
the
other
window
and
took
no
notice
of
me
i
thought
of
my
dead
godmother
of
the
night
when
i
read
to
her
of
her
frowning
so
fixedly
and
sternly
in
her
bed
of
the
strange
place
i
was
going
to
of
the
people
i
should
find
there
and
what
they
would
be
like
and
what
they
would
say
to
me
when
a
voice
in
the
coach
gave
me
a
terrible
start
it
said
what
the
are
you
crying
for
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
lost
my
voice
and
could
only
answer
in
a
whisper
me
sir
for
of
course
i
knew
it
must
have
been
the
gentleman
in
the
quantity
of
wrappings
though
he
was
still
looking
out
of
his
window
yes
you
he
said
turning
round
i
did
know
i
was
crying
sir
i
faltered
but
you
are
said
the
gentleman
look
here
he
came
quite
opposite
to
me
from
the
other
corner
of
the
coach
brushed
one
of
his
large
furry
cuffs
across
my
eyes
but
without
hurting
me
and
showed
me
that
it
was
wet
there
now
you
know
you
are
he
said
do
you
yes
sir
i
said
and
what
are
you
crying
for
said
the
gentleman
do
you
want
to
go
there
where
sir
where
why
wherever
you
are
going
said
the
gentleman
i
am
very
glad
to
go
there
sir
i
answered
well
then
look
glad
said
the
gentleman
i
thought
he
was
very
strange
or
at
least
that
what
i
could
see
of
him
was
very
strange
for
he
was
wrapped
up
to
the
chin
and
his
face
was
almost
hidden
in
a
fur
cap
with
broad
fur
straps
at
the
side
of
his
head
fastened
under
his
chin
but
i
was
composed
again
and
not
afraid
of
him
so
i
told
him
that
i
thought
i
must
have
been
crying
because
of
my
godmother
death
and
because
of
rachael
not
being
sorry
to
part
with
me
confound
mrs
rachael
said
the
gentleman
let
her
fly
away
in
a
high
wind
on
a
broomstick
i
began
to
be
really
afraid
of
him
now
and
looked
at
him
with
the
greatest
astonishment
but
i
thought
that
he
had
pleasant
eyes
although
he
kept
on
muttering
to
himself
in
an
angry
manner
and
calling
rachael
names
after
a
little
while
he
opened
his
outer
wrapper
which
appeared
to
me
large
enough
to
wrap
up
the
whole
coach
and
put
his
arm
down
into
a
deep
pocket
in
the
side
now
look
here
he
said
in
this
paper
which
was
nicely
folded
is
a
piece
of
the
best
that
can
be
got
for
money
sugar
on
the
outside
an
inch
thick
like
fat
on
mutton
chops
here
a
little
pie
a
gem
this
is
both
for
size
and
quality
made
in
france
and
what
do
you
suppose
it
made
of
livers
of
fat
geese
there
a
pie
now
let
see
you
eat
thank
you
sir
i
replied
thank
you
very
much
indeed
but
i
hope
you
wo
be
offended
they
are
too
rich
for
me
floored
again
said
the
gentleman
which
i
did
at
all
understand
and
threw
them
both
out
of
window
he
did
not
speak
to
me
any
more
until
he
got
out
of
the
coach
a
little
way
short
of
reading
when
he
advised
me
to
be
a
good
girl
and
to
be
studious
and
shook
hands
with
me
i
must
say
i
was
relieved
by
his
departure
we
left
him
at
a
milestone
i
often
walked
past
it
afterwards
and
never
for
a
long
time
without
thinking
of
him
and
half
expecting
to
meet
him
but
i
never
did
and
so
as
time
went
on
he
passed
out
of
my
mind
when
the
coach
stopped
a
very
neat
lady
looked
up
at
the
window
and
said
miss
donny
no
esther
summerson
that
is
quite
right
said
the
lady
miss
donny
i
now
understood
that
she
introduced
herself
by
that
name
and
begged
miss
donny
pardon
for
my
mistake
and
pointed
out
my
boxes
at
her
request
under
the
direction
of
a
very
neat
maid
they
were
put
outside
a
very
small
green
carriage
and
then
miss
donny
the
maid
and
i
got
inside
and
were
driven
away
everything
is
ready
for
you
esther
said
miss
donny
and
the
scheme
of
your
pursuits
has
been
arranged
in
exact
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
your
guardian
mr
jarndyce
of
did
you
say
of
your
guardian
jarndyce
said
miss
donny
i
was
so
bewildered
that
miss
donny
thought
the
cold
had
been
too
severe
for
me
and
lent
me
her
do
you
know
my
guardian
jarndyce
i
asked
after
a
good
deal
of
hesitation
not
personally
esther
said
miss
donny
merely
through
his
solicitors
kenge
and
carboy
of
london
a
very
superior
gentleman
kenge
truly
eloquent
indeed
some
of
his
periods
quite
majestic
i
felt
this
to
be
very
true
but
was
too
confused
to
attend
to
it
our
speedy
arrival
at
our
destination
before
i
had
time
to
recover
myself
increased
my
confusion
and
i
never
shall
forget
the
uncertain
and
the
unreal
air
of
everything
at
greenleaf
miss
house
that
afternoon
but
i
soon
became
used
to
it
i
was
so
adapted
to
the
routine
of
greenleaf
before
long
that
i
seemed
to
have
been
there
a
great
while
and
almost
to
have
dreamed
rather
than
really
lived
my
old
life
at
my
godmother
nothing
could
be
more
precise
exact
and
orderly
than
greenleaf
there
was
a
time
for
everything
all
round
the
dial
of
the
clock
and
everything
was
done
at
its
appointed
moment
we
were
twelve
boarders
and
there
were
two
miss
donnys
twins
it
was
understood
that
i
would
have
to
depend
by
and
by
on
my
qualifications
as
a
governess
and
i
was
not
only
instructed
in
everything
that
was
taught
at
greenleaf
but
was
very
soon
engaged
in
helping
to
instruct
others
although
i
was
treated
in
every
other
respect
like
the
rest
of
the
school
this
single
difference
was
made
in
my
case
from
the
first
as
i
began
to
know
more
i
taught
more
and
so
in
course
of
time
i
had
plenty
to
do
which
i
was
very
fond
of
doing
because
it
made
the
dear
girls
fond
of
me
at
last
whenever
a
new
pupil
came
who
was
a
little
downcast
and
unhappy
she
was
so
sure
indeed
i
do
know
why
to
make
a
friend
of
me
that
all
were
confided
to
my
care
they
said
i
was
so
gentle
but
i
am
sure
they
were
i
often
thought
of
the
resolution
i
had
made
on
my
birthday
to
try
to
be
industrious
contented
and
and
to
do
some
good
to
some
one
and
win
some
love
if
i
could
and
indeed
indeed
i
felt
almost
ashamed
to
have
done
so
little
and
have
won
so
much
i
passed
at
greenleaf
six
happy
quiet
years
i
never
saw
in
any
face
there
thank
heaven
on
my
birthday
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
never
been
born
when
the
day
came
round
it
brought
me
so
many
tokens
of
affectionate
remembrance
that
my
room
was
beautiful
with
them
from
new
year
day
to
christmas
in
those
six
years
i
had
never
been
away
except
on
visits
at
holiday
time
in
the
neighbourhood
after
the
first
six
months
or
so
i
had
taken
miss
donny
advice
in
reference
to
the
propriety
of
writing
to
kenge
to
say
that
i
was
happy
and
grateful
and
with
her
approval
i
had
written
such
a
letter
i
had
received
a
formal
answer
acknowledging
its
receipt
and
saying
we
note
the
contents
thereof
which
shall
be
duly
communicated
to
our
client
after
that
i
sometimes
heard
miss
donny
and
her
sister
mention
how
regular
my
accounts
were
paid
and
about
twice
a
year
i
ventured
to
write
a
similar
letter
i
always
received
by
return
of
post
exactly
the
same
answer
in
the
same
round
hand
with
the
signature
of
kenge
and
carboy
in
another
writing
which
i
supposed
to
be
kenge
it
seems
so
curious
to
me
to
be
obliged
to
write
all
this
about
myself
as
if
this
narrative
were
the
narrative
of
my
life
but
my
little
body
will
soon
fall
into
the
background
now
six
quiet
years
i
find
i
am
saying
it
for
the
second
time
i
had
passed
at
greenleaf
seeing
in
those
around
me
as
it
might
be
in
a
every
stage
of
my
own
growth
and
change
there
when
one
november
morning
i
received
this
letter
i
omit
the
date

madam
your
obedt
servts
kenge
and
carboy
miss
esther
summerson
oh
never
never
never
shall
i
forget
the
emotion
this
letter
caused
in
the
house
it
was
so
tender
in
them
to
care
so
much
for
me
it
was
so
gracious
in
that
father
who
had
not
forgotten
me
to
have
made
my
orphan
way
so
smooth
and
easy
and
to
have
inclined
so
many
youthful
natures
towards
me
that
i
could
hardly
bear
it
not
that
i
would
have
had
them
less
sorry
i
am
afraid
not
but
the
pleasure
of
it
and
the
pain
of
it
and
the
pride
and
joy
of
it
and
the
humble
regret
of
it
were
so
blended
that
my
heart
seemed
almost
breaking
while
it
was
full
of
rapture
the
letter
gave
me
only
five
days
notice
of
my
removal
when
every
minute
added
to
the
proofs
of
love
and
kindness
that
were
given
me
in
those
five
days
and
when
at
last
the
morning
came
and
when
they
took
me
through
all
the
rooms
that
i
might
see
them
for
the
last
time
and
when
some
cried
esther
dear
say
to
me
here
at
my
bedside
where
you
first
spoke
so
kindly
to
me
and
when
others
asked
me
only
to
write
their
names
with
esther
love
and
when
they
all
surrounded
me
with
their
parting
presents
and
clung
to
me
weeping
and
cried
what
shall
we
do
when
dear
dear
esther
gone
and
when
i
tried
to
tell
them
how
forbearing
and
how
good
they
had
all
been
to
me
and
how
i
blessed
and
thanked
them
every
one
what
a
heart
i
had
and
when
the
two
miss
donnys
grieved
as
much
to
part
with
me
as
the
least
among
them
and
when
the
maids
said
bless
you
miss
wherever
you
go
and
when
the
ugly
lame
old
gardener
who
i
thought
had
hardly
noticed
me
in
all
those
years
came
panting
after
the
coach
to
give
me
a
little
nosegay
of
geraniums
and
told
me
i
had
been
the
light
of
his
eyes
indeed
the
old
man
said
so
what
a
heart
i
had
then
and
could
i
help
it
if
with
all
this
and
the
coming
to
the
little
school
and
the
unexpected
sight
of
the
poor
children
outside
waving
their
hats
and
bonnets
to
me
and
of
a
gentleman
and
lady
whose
daughter
i
had
helped
to
teach
and
at
whose
house
i
had
visited
who
were
said
to
be
the
proudest
people
in
all
that
country
caring
for
nothing
but
calling
out
esther
may
you
be
very
happy
could
i
help
it
if
i
was
quite
bowed
down
in
the
coach
by
myself
and
said
oh
i
am
so
thankful
i
am
so
thankful
many
times
over
but
of
course
i
soon
considered
that
i
must
not
take
tears
where
i
was
going
after
all
that
had
been
done
for
me
therefore
of
course
i
made
myself
sob
less
and
persuaded
myself
to
be
quiet
by
saying
very
often
esther
now
you
really
must
this
will
not
do
i
cheered
myself
up
pretty
well
at
last
though
i
am
afraid
i
was
longer
about
it
than
i
ought
to
have
been
and
when
i
had
cooled
my
eyes
with
lavender
water
it
was
time
to
watch
for
london
i
was
quite
persuaded
that
we
were
there
when
we
were
ten
miles
off
and
when
we
really
were
there
that
we
should
never
get
there
however
when
we
began
to
jolt
upon
a
stone
pavement
and
particularly
when
every
other
conveyance
seemed
to
be
running
into
us
and
we
seemed
to
be
running
into
every
other
conveyance
i
began
to
believe
that
we
really
were
approaching
the
end
of
our
journey
very
soon
afterwards
we
stopped
a
young
gentleman
who
had
inked
himself
by
accident
addressed
me
from
the
pavement
and
said
i
am
from
kenge
and
carboy
miss
of
lincoln
inn
if
you
please
sir
said
i
he
was
very
obliging
and
as
he
handed
me
into
a
fly
after
superintending
the
removal
of
my
boxes
i
asked
him
whether
there
was
a
great
fire
anywhere
for
the
streets
were
so
full
of
dense
brown
smoke
that
scarcely
anything
was
to
be
seen
oh
dear
no
miss
he
said
this
is
a
london
particular
i
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
a
fog
miss
said
the
young
gentleman
oh
indeed
said
i
we
drove
slowly
through
the
dirtiest
and
darkest
streets
that
ever
were
seen
in
the
world
i
thought
and
in
such
a
distracting
state
of
confusion
that
i
wondered
how
the
people
kept
their
senses
until
we
passed
into
sudden
quietude
under
an
old
gateway
and
drove
on
through
a
silent
square
until
we
came
to
an
odd
nook
in
a
corner
where
there
was
an
entrance
up
a
steep
broad
flight
of
stairs
like
an
entrance
to
a
church
and
there
really
was
a
churchyard
outside
under
some
cloisters
for
i
saw
the
gravestones
from
the
staircase
window
this
was
kenge
and
carboy
the
young
gentleman
showed
me
through
an
outer
office
into
kenge
room
there
was
no
one
in
it
and
politely
put
an
for
me
by
the
fire
he
then
called
my
attention
to
a
little
hanging
from
a
nail
on
one
side
of
the
in
case
you
should
wish
to
look
at
yourself
miss
after
the
journey
as
you
going
before
the
chancellor
not
that
requisite
i
am
sure
said
the
young
gentleman
civilly
going
before
the
chancellor
i
said
startled
for
a
moment
only
a
matter
of
form
miss
returned
the
young
gentleman
kenge
is
in
court
now
he
left
his
compliments
and
would
you
partake
of
some
refreshment
there
were
biscuits
and
a
decanter
of
wine
on
a
small
table
and
look
over
the
paper
which
the
young
gentleman
gave
me
as
he
spoke
he
then
stirred
the
fire
and
left
me
everything
was
so
strange
the
stranger
from
its
being
night
in
the
the
candles
burning
with
a
white
flame
and
looking
raw
and
cold
that
i
read
the
words
in
the
newspaper
without
knowing
what
they
meant
and
found
myself
reading
the
same
words
repeatedly
as
it
was
of
no
use
going
on
in
that
way
i
put
the
paper
down
took
a
peep
at
my
bonnet
in
the
glass
to
see
if
it
was
neat
and
looked
at
the
room
which
was
not
half
lighted
and
at
the
shabby
dusty
tables
and
at
the
piles
of
writings
and
at
a
bookcase
full
of
the
most
books
that
ever
had
anything
to
say
for
themselves
then
i
went
on
thinking
thinking
thinking
and
the
fire
went
on
burning
burning
burning
and
the
candles
went
on
flickering
and
guttering
and
there
were
no
snuffers
until
the
young
gentleman
by
and
by
brought
a
very
dirty
pair
for
two
hours
at
last
kenge
came
he
was
not
altered
but
he
was
surprised
to
see
how
altered
i
was
and
appeared
quite
pleased
as
you
are
going
to
be
the
companion
of
the
young
lady
who
is
now
in
the
private
room
miss
summerson
he
said
we
thought
it
well
that
you
should
be
in
attendance
also
you
will
not
be
discomposed
by
the
lord
chancellor
i
dare
say
no
sir
i
said
i
do
think
i
shall
really
not
seeing
on
consideration
why
i
should
be
so
kenge
gave
me
his
arm
and
we
went
round
the
corner
under
a
colonnade
and
in
at
a
side
door
and
so
we
came
along
a
passage
into
a
comfortable
sort
of
room
where
a
young
lady
and
a
young
gentleman
were
standing
near
a
great
fire
a
screen
was
interposed
between
them
and
it
and
they
were
leaning
on
the
screen
talking
they
both
looked
up
when
i
came
in
and
i
saw
in
the
young
lady
with
the
fire
shining
upon
her
such
a
beautiful
girl
with
such
rich
golden
hair
such
soft
blue
eyes
and
such
a
bright
innocent
trusting
face
miss
ada
said
kenge
this
is
miss
summerson
she
came
to
meet
me
with
a
smile
of
welcome
and
her
hand
extended
but
seemed
to
change
her
mind
in
a
moment
and
kissed
me
in
short
she
had
such
a
natural
captivating
winning
manner
that
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
sitting
in
the
with
the
light
of
the
fire
upon
us
talking
together
as
free
and
happy
as
could
be
what
a
load
off
my
mind
it
was
so
delightful
to
know
that
she
could
confide
in
me
and
like
me
it
was
so
good
of
her
and
so
encouraging
to
me
the
young
gentleman
was
her
distant
cousin
she
told
me
and
his
name
richard
carstone
he
was
a
handsome
youth
with
an
ingenuous
face
and
a
most
engaging
laugh
and
after
she
had
called
him
up
to
where
we
sat
he
stood
by
us
in
the
light
of
the
fire
talking
gaily
like
a
boy
he
was
very
young
not
more
than
nineteen
then
if
quite
so
much
but
nearly
two
years
older
than
she
was
they
were
both
orphans
and
what
was
very
unexpected
and
curious
to
me
had
never
met
before
that
day
our
all
three
coming
together
for
the
first
time
in
such
an
unusual
place
was
a
thing
to
talk
about
and
we
talked
about
it
and
the
fire
which
had
left
off
roaring
winked
its
red
eyes
at
us
as
richard
said
like
a
drowsy
old
chancery
lion
we
conversed
in
a
low
tone
because
a
gentleman
in
a
bag
wig
frequently
came
in
and
out
and
when
he
did
so
we
could
hear
a
drawling
sound
in
the
distance
which
he
said
was
one
of
the
counsel
in
our
case
addressing
the
lord
chancellor
he
told
kenge
that
the
chancellor
would
be
up
in
five
minutes
and
presently
we
heard
a
bustle
and
a
tread
of
feet
and
kenge
said
that
the
court
had
risen
and
his
lordship
was
in
the
next
room
the
gentleman
in
the
bag
wig
opened
the
door
almost
directly
and
requested
kenge
to
come
in
upon
that
we
all
went
into
the
next
room
kenge
first
with
my
darling
it
is
so
natural
to
me
now
that
i
ca
help
writing
it
and
there
plainly
dressed
in
black
and
sitting
in
an
at
a
table
near
the
fire
was
his
lordship
whose
robe
trimmed
with
beautiful
gold
lace
was
thrown
upon
another
chair
he
gave
us
a
searching
look
as
we
entered
but
his
manner
was
both
courtly
and
kind
the
gentleman
in
the
bag
wig
laid
bundles
of
papers
on
his
table
and
his
lordship
silently
selected
one
and
turned
over
the
leaves
miss
clare
said
the
lord
chancellor
miss
ada
clare
kenge
presented
her
and
his
lordship
begged
her
to
sit
down
near
him
that
he
admired
her
and
was
interested
by
her
even
i
could
see
in
a
moment
it
touched
me
that
the
home
of
such
a
beautiful
young
creature
should
be
represented
by
that
dry
official
place
the
lord
high
chancellor
at
his

and
stepped

hum
said
the
lord
chancellor
turning
over
more
leaves
jarndyce
of
bleak
house
my
lord
kenge
observed
in
a
low
voice
if
i
may
venture
to
remind
your
lordship
provides
a
suitable
companion
for
for
richard
carstone
i
thought
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
heard
his
lordship
say
in
an
equally
low
voice
and
with
a
smile
for
miss
ada
clare
this
is
the
young
lady
miss
summerson
his
lordship
gave
me
an
indulgent
look
and
acknowledged
my
curtsy
very
graciously
miss
summerson
is
not
related
to
any
party
in
the
cause
i
think
no
my
lord
kenge
leant
over
before
it
was
quite
said
and
whispered
his
lordship
with
his
eyes
upon
his
papers
listened
nodded
twice
or
thrice
turned
over
more
leaves
and
did
not
look
towards
me
again
until
we
were
going
away
kenge
now
retired
and
richard
with
him
to
where
i
was
near
the
door
leaving
my
pet
it
is
so
natural
to
me
that
again
i
ca
help
it
sitting
near
the
lord
chancellor
with
whom
his
lordship
spoke
a
little
part
asking
her
as
she
told
me
afterwards
whether
she
had
well
reflected
on
the
proposed
arrangement
and
if
she
thought
she
would
be
happy
under
the
roof
of
jarndyce
of
bleak
house
and
why
she
thought
so
presently
he
rose
courteously
and
released
her
and
then
he
spoke
for
a
minute
or
two
with
richard
carstone
not
seated
but
standing
and
altogether
with
more
ease
and
less
ceremony
as
if
he
still
knew
though
he
was
lord
chancellor
how
to
go
straight
to
the
candour
of
a
boy
very
well
said
his
lordship
aloud
i
shall
make
the
order
jarndyce
of
bleak
house
has
chosen
so
far
as
i
may
judge
and
this
was
when
he
looked
at
me
a
very
good
companion
for
the
young
lady
and
the
arrangement
altogether
seems
the
best
of
which
the
circumstances
admit
he
dismissed
us
pleasantly
and
we
all
went
out
very
much
obliged
to
him
for
being
so
affable
and
polite
by
which
he
had
certainly
lost
no
dignity
but
seemed
to
us
to
have
gained
some
when
we
got
under
the
colonnade
kenge
remembered
that
he
must
go
back
for
a
moment
to
ask
a
question
and
left
us
in
the
fog
with
the
lord
chancellor
carriage
and
servants
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
well
said
richard
carstone
that
over
and
where
do
we
go
next
miss
summerson
do
you
know
i
said
not
in
the
least
said
he
and
do
you
know
my
love
i
asked
ada
no
said
she
do
you
not
at
all
said
i
we
looked
at
one
another
half
laughing
at
our
being
like
the
children
in
the
wood
when
a
curious
little
old
woman
in
a
squeezed
bonnet
and
carrying
a
reticule
came
curtsying
and
smiling
up
to
us
with
an
air
of
great
ceremony
oh
said
she
the
wards
in
jarndyce
happy
i
am
sure
to
have
the
honour
it
is
a
good
omen
for
youth
and
hope
and
beauty
when
they
find
themselves
in
this
place
and
do
know
what
to
come
of
it
mad
whispered
richard
not
thinking
she
could
hear
him
right
mad
young
gentleman
she
returned
so
quickly
that
he
was
quite
abashed
i
was
a
ward
myself
i
was
not
mad
at
that
time
curtsying
low
and
smiling
between
every
little
sentence
i
had
youth
and
hope
i
believe
beauty
it
matters
very
little
now
neither
of
the
three
served
or
saved
me
i
have
the
honour
to
attend
court
regularly
with
my
documents
i
expect
a
judgment
shortly
on
the
day
of
judgment
i
have
discovered
that
the
sixth
seal
mentioned
in
the
revelations
is
the
great
seal
it
has
been
open
a
long
time
pray
accept
my
blessing
as
ada
was
a
little
frightened
i
said
to
humour
the
poor
old
lady
that
we
were
much
obliged
to
her
she
said
mincingly
i
imagine
so
and
here
is
conversation
kenge
with
his
documents
how
does
your
honourable
worship
do
quite
well
quite
well
now
do
be
troublesome

a
good
soul

kenge

the
way
back

no
means
said
the
poor
old
lady
keeping
up
with
ada
and
me
anything
but
troublesome
i
shall
confer
estates
on
both
which
is
not

troublesome
i
trust
i
expect

judgment
shortly
on
the
day
of
judgment
this
is
a
good
omen
for
you
accept
my

she
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
steep
broad
flight
of
stairs
but
we
looked
back
as
we
went
up
and
she
was
still
there
saying
still
with
a
curtsy
and
a
smile
between
every
little
sentence

and
hope
and

we
were
to
pass
the
night
kenge
told
us
when
we
arrived
in
his
room
at
jellyby
and
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
he
took
it
for
granted
i
knew
who
jellyby
was
i
really
do
sir
i
returned
perhaps
carstone
or
miss
clare
but
no
they
knew
nothing
whatever
about
jellyby
jellyby
said
kenge
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
casting
his
eyes
over
the
dusty
as
if
it
were
jellyby
biography
is
a
lady
of
very
remarkable
strength
of
character
who
devotes
herself
entirely
to
the
public
she
has
devoted
herself
to
an
extensive
variety
of
public
subjects
at
various
times
and
is
at
present
until
something
else
attracts
her
devoted
to
the
subject
of
africa
with
a
view
to
the
general
cultivation
of
the
coffee
berry
and
the
natives
and
the
happy
settlement
on
the
banks
of
the
african
rivers
of
our
superabundant
home
population
jarndyce
who
is
desirous
to
aid
any
work
that
is
considered
likely
to
be
a
good
work
and
who
is
much
sought
after
by
philanthropists
has
i
believe
a
very
high
opinion
of
mrs
jellyby
kenge
adjusting
his
cravat
then
looked
at
us
and
jellyby
sir
suggested
richard
ah
jellyby
said
kenge
is
a
i
do
know
that
i
can
describe
him
to
you
better
than
by
saying
that
he
is
the
husband
of
mrs
jellyby
a
nonentity
sir
said
richard
with
a
droll
look
i
do
say
that
returned
kenge
gravely
i
ca
say
that
indeed
for
i
know
nothing
whatever
of
jellyby
i
never
to
my
knowledge
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
jellyby
he
may
be
a
very
superior
man
but
he
is
so
to
speak
merged
merged
in
the
more
shining
qualities
of
his
wife
kenge
proceeded
to
tell
us
that
as
the
road
to
bleak
house
would
have
been
very
long
dark
and
tedious
on
such
an
evening
and
as
we
had
been
travelling
already
jarndyce
had
himself
proposed
this
arrangement
a
carriage
would
be
at
jellyby
to
convey
us
out
of
town
early
in
the
forenoon
of
he
then
rang
a
little
bell
and
the
young
gentleman
came
in
addressing
him
by
the
name
of
guppy
kenge
inquired
whether
miss
summerson
boxes
and
the
rest
of
the
baggage
had
been
sent
round
guppy
said
yes
they
had
been
sent
round
and
a
coach
was
waiting
to
take
us
round
too
as
soon
as
we
pleased
then
it
only
remains
said
kenge
shaking
hands
with
us
for
me
to
express
my
lively
satisfaction
in
good
day
miss
clare
the
arrangement
this
day
concluded
and
my
to
you
miss
summerson
lively
hope
that
it
will
conduce
to
the
happiness
the
glad
to
have
had
the
honour
of
making
your
acquaintance
mr
carstone
welfare
the
advantage
in
all
points
of
view
of
all
concerned
guppy
see
the
party
safely
there
where
is
mr
guppy
said
richard
as
we
went
downstairs
no
distance
said
guppy
round
in
thavies
inn
you
know
i
ca
say
i
know
where
it
is
for
i
come
from
winchester
and
am
strange
in
london
only
round
the
corner
said
guppy
we
just
twist
up
chancery
lane
and
cut
along
holborn
and
there
we
are
in
four
minutes
time
as
near
as
a
toucher
this
is
about
a
london
particular
now
it
miss
he
seemed
quite
delighted
with
it
on
my
account
the
fog
is
very
dense
indeed
said
i
not
that
it
affects
you
though
i
sure
said
guppy
putting
up
the
steps
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
do
you
good
miss
judging
from
your
appearance
i
knew
he
meant
well
in
paying
me
this
compliment
so
i
laughed
at
myself
for
blushing
at
it
when
he
had
shut
the
door
and
got
upon
the
box
and
we
all
three
laughed
and
chatted
about
our
inexperience
and
the
strangeness
of
london
until
we
turned
up
under
an
archway
to
our
destination
a
narrow
street
of
high
houses
like
an
oblong
cistern
to
hold
the
fog
there
was
a
confused
little
crowd
of
people
principally
children
gathered
about
the
house
at
which
we
stopped
which
had
a
tarnished
brass
plate
on
the
door
with
the
inscription
jellyby
do
be
frightened
said
guppy
looking
in
at
the
one
of
the
young
jellybys
been
and
got
his
head
through
the
area
railings
oh
poor
child
said
i
let
me
out
if
you
please
pray
be
careful
of
yourself
miss
the
young
jellybys
are
always
up
to
something
said
guppy
i
made
my
way
to
the
poor
child
who
was
one
of
the
dirtiest
little
unfortunates
i
ever
saw
and
found
him
very
hot
and
frightened
and
crying
loudly
fixed
by
the
neck
between
two
iron
railings
while
a
milkman
and
a
beadle
with
the
kindest
intentions
possible
were
endeavouring
to
drag
him
back
by
the
legs
under
a
general
impression
that
his
skull
was
compressible
by
those
means
as
i
found
after
pacifying
him
that
he
was
a
little
boy
with
a
naturally
large
head
i
thought
that
perhaps
where
his
head
could
go
his
body
could
follow
and
mentioned
that
the
best
mode
of
extrication
might
be
to
push
him
forward
this
was
so
favourably
received
by
the
milkman
and
beadle
that
he
would
immediately
have
been
pushed
into
the
area
if
i
had
not
held
his
pinafore
while
richard
and
guppy
ran
down
through
the
kitchen
to
catch
him
when
he
should
be
released
at
last
he
was
happily
got
down
without
any
accident
and
then
he
began
to
beat
guppy
with
a
in
quite
a
frantic
manner
nobody
had
appeared
belonging
to
the
house
except
a
person
in
pattens
who
had
been
poking
at
the
child
from
below
with
a
broom
i
do
know
with
what
object
and
i
do
think
she
did
i
therefore
supposed
that
jellyby
was
not
at
home
and
was
quite
surprised
when
the
person
appeared
in
the
passage
without
the
pattens
and
going
up
to
the
back
room
on
the
first
floor
before
ada
and
me
announced
us
as
them
two
young
ladies
missis
jellyby
we
passed
several
more
children
on
the
way
up
whom
it
was
difficult
to
avoid
treading
on
in
the
dark
and
as
we
came
into
jellyby
presence
one
of
the
poor
little
things
fell
downstairs
down
a
whole
flight
as
it
sounded
to
me
with
a
great
noise
jellyby
whose
face
reflected
none
of
the
uneasiness
which
we
could
not
help
showing
in
our
own
faces
as
the
dear
child
head
recorded
its
passage
with
a
bump
on
every
stair
richard
afterwards
said
he
counted
seven
besides
one
for
the
landing
received
us
with
perfect
equanimity
she
was
a
pretty
very
diminutive
plump
woman
of
from
forty
to
fifty
with
handsome
eyes
though
they
had
a
curious
habit
of
seeming
to
look
a
long
way
off
as
if
i
am
quoting
richard
again
they
could
see
nothing
nearer
than
africa
i
am
very
glad
indeed
said
jellyby
in
an
agreeable
voice
to
have
the
pleasure
of
receiving
you
i
have
a
great
respect
for
jarndyce
and
no
one
in
whom
he
is
interested
can
be
an
object
of
indifference
to
me
we
expressed
our
acknowledgments
and
sat
down
behind
the
door
where
there
was
a
lame
invalid
of
a
sofa
jellyby
had
very
good
hair
but
was
too
much
occupied
with
her
african
duties
to
brush
it
the
shawl
in
which
she
had
been
loosely
muffled
dropped
onto
her
chair
when
she
advanced
to
us
and
as
she
turned
to
resume
her
seat
we
could
not
help
noticing
that
her
dress
did
nearly
meet
up
the
back
and
that
the
open
space
was
railed
across
with
a
of
like
a
the
room
which
was
strewn
with
papers
and
nearly
filled
by
a
great
covered
with
similar
litter
was
i
must
say
not
only
very
untidy
but
very
dirty
we
were
obliged
to
take
notice
of
that
with
our
sense
of
sight
even
while
with
our
sense
of
hearing
we
followed
the
poor
child
who
had
tumbled
downstairs
i
think
into
the
back
kitchen
where
somebody
seemed
to
stifle
him
but
what
principally
struck
us
was
a
jaded
and
though
by
no
means
plain
girl
at
the
who
sat
biting
the
feather
of
her
pen
and
staring
at
us
i
suppose
nobody
ever
was
in
such
a
state
of
ink
and
from
her
tumbled
hair
to
her
pretty
feet
which
were
disfigured
with
frayed
and
broken
satin
slippers
trodden
down
at
heel
she
really
seemed
to
have
no
article
of
dress
upon
her
from
a
pin
upwards
that
was
in
its
proper
condition
or
its
right
place
you
find
me
my
dears
said
jellyby
snuffing
the
two
great
office
candles
in
tin
candlesticks
which
made
the
room
taste
strongly
of
hot
tallow
the
fire
had
gone
out
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
grate
but
ashes
a
bundle
of
wood
and
a
poker
you
find
me
my
dears
as
usual
very
busy
but
that
you
will
excuse
the
african
project
at
present
employs
my
whole
time
it
involves
me
in
correspondence
with
public
bodies
and
with
private
individuals
anxious
for
the
welfare
of
their
species
all
over
the
country
i
am
happy
to
say
it
is
advancing
we
hope
by
this
time
next
year
to
have
from
a
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
healthy
families
cultivating
coffee
and
educating
the
natives
of
on
the
left
bank
of
the
niger
as
ada
said
nothing
but
looked
at
me
i
said
it
must
be
very
gratifying
it
is
gratifying
said
jellyby
it
involves
the
devotion
of
all
my
energies
such
as
they
are
but
that
is
nothing
so
that
it
succeeds
and
i
am
more
confident
of
success
every
day
do
you
know
miss
summerson
i
almost
wonder
that
you
never
turned
your
thoughts
to
africa
this
application
of
the
subject
was
really
so
unexpected
to
me
that
i
was
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
receive
it
i
hinted
that
the
climate
the
finest
climate
in
the
world
said
jellyby
indeed
certainly
with
precaution
said
jellyby
you
may
go
into
holborn
without
precaution
and
be
run
over
you
may
go
into
holborn
with
precaution
and
never
be
run
over
just
so
with
africa
i
said
no
doubt
i
meant
as
to
holborn
if
you
would
like
said
jellyby
putting
a
number
of
papers
towards
us
to
look
over
some
remarks
on
that
head
and
on
the
general
subject
which
have
been
extensively
circulated
while
i
finish
a
letter
i
am
now
dictating
to
my
eldest
daughter
who
is
my
amanuensis
the
girl
at
the
table
left
off
biting
her
pen
and
made
a
return
to
our
recognition
which
was
half
bashful
and
half
i
shall
then
have
finished
for
the
present
proceeded
jellyby
with
a
sweet
smile
though
my
work
is
never
done
where
are
you
caddy
her
compliments
to
mr
swallow
and
begs
said
caddy
begs
said
jellyby
dictating
inform
him
in
reference
to
his
letter
of
inquiry
on
the
african
project
no
peepy
not
on
my
account
peepy
so
was
the
unfortunate
child
who
had
fallen
downstairs
who
now
interrupted
the
correspondence
by
presenting
himself
with
a
strip
of
plaster
on
his
forehead
to
exhibit
his
wounded
knees
in
which
ada
and
i
did
not
know
which
to
pity
most
the
bruises
or
the
dirt
jellyby
merely
added
with
the
serene
composure
with
which
she
said
everything
go
along
you
naughty
peepy
and
fixed
her
fine
eyes
on
africa
again
however
as
she
at
once
proceeded
with
her
dictation
and
as
i
interrupted
nothing
by
doing
it
i
ventured
quietly
to
stop
poor
peepy
as
he
was
going
out
and
to
take
him
up
to
nurse
he
looked
very
much
astonished
at
it
and
at
ada
kissing
him
but
soon
fell
fast
asleep
in
my
arms
sobbing
at
longer
and
longer
intervals
until
he
was
quiet
i
was
so
occupied
with
peepy
that
i
lost
the
letter
in
detail
though
i
derived
such
a
general
impression
from
it
of
the
momentous
importance
of
africa
and
the
utter
insignificance
of
all
other
places
and
things
that
i
felt
quite
ashamed
to
have
thought
so
little
about
it
six
said
jellyby
and
our
dinner
hour
is
nominally
for
we
dine
at
all
hours
five
caddy
show
miss
clare
and
miss
summerson
their
rooms
you
will
like
to
make
some
change
perhaps
you
will
excuse
me
i
know
being
so
much
occupied
oh
that
very
bad
child
pray
put
him
down
miss
summerson
i
begged
permission
to
retain
him
truly
saying
that
he
was
not
at
all
troublesome
and
carried
him
upstairs
and
laid
him
on
my
bed
ada
and
i
had
two
upper
rooms
with
a
door
of
communication
between
they
were
excessively
bare
and
disorderly
and
the
curtain
to
my
window
was
fastened
up
with
a
fork
you
would
like
some
hot
water
would
you
said
miss
jellyby
looking
round
for
a
jug
with
a
handle
to
it
but
looking
in
vain
if
it
is
not
being
troublesome
said
we
oh
it
not
the
trouble
returned
miss
jellyby
the
question
is
if
there
is
any
the
evening
was
so
very
cold
and
the
rooms
had
such
a
marshy
smell
that
i
must
confess
it
was
a
little
miserable
and
ada
was
half
crying
we
soon
laughed
however
and
were
busily
unpacking
when
miss
jellyby
came
back
to
say
that
she
was
sorry
there
was
no
hot
water
but
they
could
find
the
kettle
and
the
boiler
was
out
of
order
we
begged
her
not
to
mention
it
and
made
all
the
haste
we
could
to
get
down
to
the
fire
again
but
all
the
little
children
had
come
up
to
the
landing
outside
to
look
at
the
phenomenon
of
peepy
lying
on
my
bed
and
our
attention
was
distracted
by
the
constant
apparition
of
noses
and
fingers
in
situations
of
danger
between
the
hinges
of
the
doors
it
was
impossible
to
shut
the
door
of
either
room
for
my
lock
with
no
knob
to
it
looked
as
if
it
wanted
to
be
wound
up
and
though
the
handle
of
ada
went
round
and
round
with
the
greatest
smoothness
it
was
attended
with
no
effect
whatever
on
the
door
therefore
i
proposed
to
the
children
that
they
should
come
in
and
be
very
good
at
my
table
and
i
would
tell
them
the
story
of
little
red
riding
hood
while
i
dressed
which
they
did
and
were
as
quiet
as
mice
including
peepy
who
awoke
opportunely
before
the
appearance
of
the
wolf
when
we
went
downstairs
we
found
a
mug
with
a
present
from
tunbridge
wells
on
it
lighted
up
in
the
staircase
window
with
a
floating
wick
and
a
young
woman
with
a
swelled
face
bound
up
in
a
flannel
bandage
blowing
the
fire
of
the
now
connected
by
an
open
door
with
jellyby
room
and
choking
dreadfully
it
smoked
to
that
degree
in
short
that
we
all
sat
coughing
and
crying
with
the
windows
open
for
half
an
hour
during
which
jellyby
with
the
same
sweetness
of
temper
directed
letters
about
africa
her
being
so
employed
was
i
must
say
a
great
relief
to
me
for
richard
told
us
that
he
had
washed
his
hands
in
a
and
that
they
had
found
the
kettle
on
his
and
he
made
ada
laugh
so
that
they
made
me
laugh
in
the
most
ridiculous
manner
soon
after
seven
we
went
down
to
dinner
carefully
by
jellyby
advice
for
the
besides
being
very
deficient
in
were
so
torn
as
to
be
absolute
traps
we
had
a
fine
a
piece
of
roast
beef
a
dish
of
cutlets
and
a
pudding
an
excellent
dinner
if
it
had
had
any
cooking
to
speak
of
but
it
was
almost
raw
the
young
woman
with
the
flannel
bandage
waited
and
dropped
everything
on
the
table
wherever
it
happened
to
go
and
never
moved
it
again
until
she
put
it
on
the
stairs
the
person
i
had
seen
in
pattens
who
i
suppose
to
have
been
the
cook
frequently
came
and
skirmished
with
her
at
the
door
and
there
appeared
to
be
ill
will
between
them
all
through
dinner
which
was
long
in
consequence
of
such
accidents
as
the
dish
of
potatoes
being
mislaid
in
the
coal
skuttle
and
the
handle
of
the
corkscrew
coming
off
and
striking
the
young
woman
in
the
chin
jellyby
preserved
the
evenness
of
her
disposition
she
told
us
a
great
deal
that
was
interesting
about
and
the
natives
and
received
so
many
letters
that
richard
who
sat
by
her
saw
four
envelopes
in
the
gravy
at
once
some
of
the
letters
were
proceedings
of
ladies
committees
or
resolutions
of
meetings
which
she
read
to
us
others
were
applications
from
people
excited
in
various
ways
about
the
cultivation
of
coffee
and
natives
others
required
answers
and
these
she
sent
her
eldest
daughter
from
the
table
three
or
four
times
to
write
she
was
full
of
business
and
undoubtedly
was
as
she
had
told
us
devoted
to
the
cause
i
was
a
little
curious
to
know
who
a
mild
bald
gentleman
in
spectacles
was
who
dropped
into
a
vacant
chair
there
was
no
top
or
bottom
in
particular
after
the
fish
was
taken
away
and
seemed
passively
to
submit
himself
to
but
not
to
be
actively
interested
in
that
settlement
as
he
never
spoke
a
word
he
might
have
been
a
native
but
for
his
complexion
it
was
not
until
we
left
the
table
and
he
remained
alone
with
richard
that
the
possibility
of
his
being
jellyby
ever
entered
my
head
but
he
was
jellyby
and
a
loquacious
young
man
called
quale
with
large
shining
knobs
for
temples
and
his
hair
all
brushed
to
the
back
of
his
head
who
came
in
the
evening
and
told
ada
he
was
a
philanthropist
also
informed
her
that
he
called
the
matrimonial
alliance
of
jellyby
with
jellyby
the
union
of
mind
and
matter
this
young
man
besides
having
a
great
deal
to
say
for
himself
about
africa
and
a
project
of
his
for
teaching
the
coffee
colonists
to
teach
the
natives
to
turn
legs
and
establish
an
export
trade
delighted
in
drawing
jellyby
out
by
saying
i
believe
now
jellyby
you
have
received
as
many
as
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
letters
respecting
africa
in
a
single
day
have
you
not
or
if
my
memory
does
not
deceive
me
jellyby
you
once
mentioned
that
you
had
sent
off
five
thousand
circulars
from
one
at
one
time
always
repeating
jellyby
answer
to
us
like
an
interpreter
during
the
whole
evening
jellyby
sat
in
a
corner
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
if
he
were
subject
to
low
spirits
it
seemed
that
he
had
several
times
opened
his
mouth
when
alone
with
richard
after
dinner
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
but
had
always
shut
it
again
to
richard
extreme
confusion
without
saying
anything
jellyby
sitting
in
quite
a
nest
of
waste
paper
drank
coffee
all
the
evening
and
dictated
at
intervals
to
her
eldest
daughter
she
also
held
a
discussion
with
quale
of
which
the
subject
seemed
to
be
if
i
understood
it
the
brotherhood
of
humanity
and
gave
utterance
to
some
beautiful
sentiments
i
was
not
so
attentive
an
auditor
as
i
might
have
wished
to
be
however
for
peepy
and
the
other
children
came
flocking
about
ada
and
me
in
a
corner
of
the
to
ask
for
another
story
so
we
sat
down
among
them
and
told
them
in
whispers
puss
in
boots
and
i
do
know
what
else
until
jellyby
accidentally
remembering
them
sent
them
to
bed
as
peepy
cried
for
me
to
take
him
to
bed
i
carried
him
upstairs
where
the
young
woman
with
the
flannel
bandage
charged
into
the
midst
of
the
little
family
like
a
dragon
and
overturned
them
into
cribs
after
that
i
occupied
myself
in
making
our
room
a
little
tidy
and
in
coaxing
a
very
cross
fire
that
had
been
lighted
to
burn
which
at
last
it
did
quite
brightly
on
my
return
downstairs
i
felt
that
jellyby
looked
down
upon
me
rather
for
being
so
frivolous
and
i
was
sorry
for
it
though
at
the
same
time
i
knew
that
i
had
no
higher
pretensions
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
we
found
an
opportunity
of
going
to
bed
and
even
then
we
left
jellyby
among
her
papers
drinking
coffee
and
miss
jellyby
biting
the
feather
of
her
pen
what
a
strange
house
said
ada
when
we
got
upstairs
how
curious
of
my
cousin
jarndyce
to
send
us
here
my
love
said
i
it
quite
confuses
me
i
want
to
understand
it
and
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
what
asked
ada
with
her
pretty
smile
all
this
my
dear
said
i
it
must
be
very
good
of
jellyby
to
take
such
pains
about
a
scheme
for
the
benefit
of
natives
and
yet
peepy
and
the
housekeeping
ada
laughed
and
put
her
arm
about
my
neck
as
i
stood
looking
at
the
fire
and
told
me
i
was
a
quiet
dear
good
creature
and
had
won
her
heart
you
are
so
thoughtful
esther
she
said
and
yet
so
cheerful
and
you
do
so
much
so
unpretendingly
you
would
make
a
home
out
of
even
this
house
my
simple
darling
she
was
quite
unconscious
that
she
only
praised
herself
and
that
it
was
in
the
goodness
of
her
own
heart
that
she
made
so
much
of
me
may
i
ask
you
a
question
said
i
when
we
had
sat
before
the
fire
a
little
while
five
hundred
said
ada
your
cousin
jarndyce
i
owe
so
much
to
him
would
you
mind
describing
him
to
me
shaking
her
golden
hair
ada
turned
her
eyes
upon
me
with
such
laughing
wonder
that
i
was
full
of
wonder
too
partly
at
her
beauty
partly
at
her
surprise
esther
she
cried
my
dear
you
want
a
description
of
my
cousin
jarndyce
my
dear
i
never
saw
him
and
i
never
saw
him
returned
ada
well
to
be
sure
no
she
had
never
seen
him
young
as
she
was
when
her
mama
died
she
remembered
how
the
tears
would
come
into
her
eyes
when
she
spoke
of
him
and
of
the
noble
generosity
of
his
character
which
she
had
said
was
to
be
trusted
above
all
earthly
things
and
ada
trusted
it
her
cousin
jarndyce
had
written
to
her
a
few
months
ago
a
plain
honest
letter
ada
said
proposing
the
arrangement
we
were
now
to
enter
on
and
telling
her
that
in
time
it
might
heal
some
of
the
wounds
made
by
the
miserable
chancery
suit
she
had
replied
gratefully
accepting
his
proposal
richard
had
received
a
similar
letter
and
had
made
a
similar
response
he
had
seen
jarndyce
once
but
only
once
five
years
ago
at
winchester
school
he
had
told
ada
when
they
were
leaning
on
the
screen
before
the
fire
where
i
found
them
that
he
recollected
him
as
a
bluff
rosy
fellow
this
was
the
utmost
description
ada
could
give
me
it
set
me
thinking
so
that
when
ada
was
asleep
i
still
remained
before
the
fire
wondering
and
wondering
about
bleak
house
and
wondering
and
wondering
that
yesterday
morning
should
seem
so
long
ago
i
do
know
where
my
thoughts
had
wandered
when
they
were
recalled
by
a
tap
at
the
door
i
opened
it
softly
and
found
miss
jellyby
shivering
there
with
a
broken
candle
in
a
broken
candlestick
in
one
hand
and
an
in
the
other
good
night
she
said
very
sulkily
good
night
said
i
may
i
come
in
she
shortly
and
unexpectedly
asked
me
in
the
same
sulky
way
certainly
said
i
do
wake
miss
clare
she
would
not
sit
down
but
stood
by
the
fire
dipping
her
inky
middle
finger
in
the
which
contained
vinegar
and
smearing
it
over
the
ink
stains
on
her
face
frowning
the
whole
time
and
looking
very
gloomy
i
wish
africa
was
dead
she
said
on
a
sudden
i
was
going
to
remonstrate
i
do
she
said
do
talk
to
me
miss
summerson
i
hate
it
and
detest
it
it
a
beast
i
told
her
she
was
tired
and
i
was
sorry
i
put
my
hand
upon
her
head
and
touched
her
forehead
and
said
it
was
hot
now
but
would
be
cool
she
still
stood
pouting
and
frowning
at
me
but
presently
put
down
her
and
turned
softly
towards
the
bed
where
ada
lay
she
is
very
pretty
she
said
with
the
same
knitted
brow
and
in
the
same
uncivil
manner
i
assented
with
a
smile
an
orphan
ai
she
yes
but
knows
a
quantity
i
suppose
can
dance
and
play
music
and
sing
she
can
talk
french
i
suppose
and
do
geography
and
globes
and
needlework
and
everything
no
doubt
said
i
i
ca
she
returned
i
ca
do
anything
hardly
except
write
i
always
writing
for
ma
i
wonder
you
two
were
not
ashamed
of
yourselves
to
come
in
this
afternoon
and
see
me
able
to
do
nothing
else
it
was
like
your
ill
nature
yet
you
think
yourselves
very
fine
i
dare
say
i
could
see
that
the
poor
girl
was
near
crying
and
i
resumed
my
chair
without
speaking
and
looked
at
her
i
hope
as
mildly
as
i
felt
towards
her
it
disgraceful
she
said
you
know
it
is
the
whole
house
is
disgraceful
the
children
are
disgraceful
i
disgraceful
miserable
and
no
wonder
priscilla
drinks
she
always
drinking
it
a
great
shame
and
a
great
story
of
you
if
you
say
you
smell
her
it
was
as
bad
as
a
waiting
at
dinner
you
know
it
was
my
dear
i
do
know
it
said
i
you
do
she
said
very
shortly
you
sha
say
you
do
you
do
oh
my
dear
said
i
if
you
wo
let
me
speak
you
speaking
now
you
know
you
are
do
tell
stories
miss
summerson
my
dear
said
i
as
long
as
you
wo
hear
me
out
i
do
want
to
hear
you
out
oh
yes
i
think
you
do
said
i
because
that
would
be
so
very
unreasonable
i
did
not
know
what
you
tell
me
because
the
servant
did
not
come
near
me
at
dinner
but
i
do
doubt
what
you
tell
me
and
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
you
need
make
a
merit
of
that
said
she
no
my
dear
said
i
that
would
be
very
foolish
she
was
still
standing
by
the
bed
and
now
stooped
down
but
still
with
the
same
discontented
face
and
kissed
ada
that
done
she
came
softly
back
and
stood
by
the
side
of
my
chair
her
bosom
was
heaving
in
a
distressful
manner
that
i
greatly
pitied
but
i
thought
it
better
not
to
speak
i
wish
i
was
dead
she
broke
out
i
wish
we
were
all
dead
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
us
in
a
moment
afterwards
she
knelt
on
the
ground
at
my
side
hid
her
face
in
my
dress
passionately
begged
my
pardon
and
wept
i
comforted
her
and
would
have
raised
her
but
she
cried
no
no
she
wanted
to
stay
there
you
used
to
teach
girls
she
said
if
you
could
only
have
taught
me
i
could
have
learnt
from
you
i
am
so
very
miserable
and
i
like
you
so
much
i
could
not
persuade
her
to
sit
by
me
or
to
do
anything
but
move
a
ragged
stool
to
where
she
was
kneeling
and
take
that
and
still
hold
my
dress
in
the
same
manner
by
degrees
the
poor
tired
girl
fell
asleep
and
then
i
contrived
to
raise
her
head
so
that
it
should
rest
on
my
lap
and
to
cover
us
both
with
shawls
the
fire
went
out
and
all
night
long
she
slumbered
thus
before
the
ashy
grate
at
first
i
was
painfully
awake
and
vainly
tried
to
lose
myself
with
my
eyes
closed
among
the
scenes
of
the
day
at
length
by
slow
degrees
they
became
indistinct
and
mingled
i
began
to
lose
the
identity
of
the
sleeper
resting
on
me
now
it
was
ada
now
one
of
my
old
reading
friends
from
whom
i
could
not
believe
i
had
so
recently
parted
now
it
was
the
little
mad
woman
worn
out
with
curtsying
and
smiling
now
some
one
in
authority
at
bleak
house
lastly
it
was
no
one
and
i
was
no
one
the
purblind
day
was
feebly
struggling
with
the
fog
when
i
opened
my
eyes
to
encounter
those
of
a
little
spectre
fixed
upon
me
peepy
had
scaled
his
crib
and
crept
down
in
his
and
cap
and
was
so
cold
that
his
teeth
were
chattering
as
if
he
had
cut
them
all
chapter
v
a
morning
adventure
although
the
morning
was
raw
and
although
the
fog
still
seemed
heavy
i
say
seemed
for
the
windows
were
so
encrusted
with
dirt
that
they
would
have
made
midsummer
sunshine
dim
i
was
sufficiently
forewarned
of
the
discomfort
within
doors
at
that
early
hour
and
sufficiently
curious
about
london
to
think
it
a
good
idea
on
the
part
of
miss
jellyby
when
she
proposed
that
we
should
go
out
for
a
walk
ma
wo
be
down
for
ever
so
long
she
said
and
then
it
a
chance
if
breakfast
ready
for
an
hour
afterwards
they
dawdle
so
as
to
pa
he
gets
what
he
can
and
goes
to
the
office
he
never
has
what
you
would
call
a
regular
breakfast
priscilla
leaves
him
out
the
loaf
and
some
milk
when
there
is
any
overnight
sometimes
there
is
any
milk
and
sometimes
the
cat
drinks
it
but
i
afraid
you
must
be
tired
miss
summerson
and
perhaps
you
would
rather
go
to
bed
i
am
not
at
all
tired
my
dear
said
i
and
would
much
prefer
to
go
out
if
you
sure
you
would
returned
miss
jellyby
i
get
my
things
on
ada
said
she
would
go
too
and
was
soon
astir
i
made
a
proposal
to
peepy
in
default
of
being
able
to
do
anything
better
for
him
that
he
should
let
me
wash
him
and
afterwards
lay
him
down
on
my
bed
again
to
this
he
submitted
with
the
best
grace
possible
staring
at
me
during
the
whole
operation
as
if
he
never
had
been
and
never
could
again
be
so
astonished
in
his
life
looking
very
miserable
also
certainly
but
making
no
complaint
and
going
snugly
to
sleep
as
soon
as
it
was
over
at
first
i
was
in
two
minds
about
taking
such
a
liberty
but
i
soon
reflected
that
nobody
in
the
house
was
likely
to
notice
it
what
with
the
bustle
of
dispatching
peepy
and
the
bustle
of
getting
myself
ready
and
helping
ada
i
was
soon
quite
in
a
glow
we
found
miss
jellyby
trying
to
warm
herself
at
the
fire
in
the
which
priscilla
was
then
lighting
with
a
smutty
parlour
candlestick
throwing
the
candle
in
to
make
it
burn
better
everything
was
just
as
we
had
left
it
last
night
and
was
evidently
intended
to
remain
so
the
had
not
been
taken
away
but
had
been
left
ready
for
breakfast
crumbs
dust
and
were
all
over
the
house
some
pewter
pots
and
a
hung
on
the
area
railings
the
door
stood
open
and
we
met
the
cook
round
the
corner
coming
out
of
a
wiping
her
mouth
she
mentioned
as
she
passed
us
that
she
had
been
to
see
what
it
was
but
before
we
met
the
cook
we
met
richard
who
was
dancing
up
and
down
thavies
inn
to
warm
his
feet
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
us
stirring
so
soon
and
said
he
would
gladly
share
our
walk
so
he
took
care
of
ada
and
miss
jellyby
and
i
went
first
i
may
mention
that
miss
jellyby
had
relapsed
into
her
sulky
manner
and
that
i
really
should
not
have
thought
she
liked
me
much
unless
she
had
told
me
so
where
would
you
wish
to
go
she
asked
anywhere
my
dear
i
replied
anywhere
nowhere
said
miss
jellyby
stopping
perversely
let
us
go
somewhere
at
any
rate
said
i
she
then
walked
me
on
very
fast
i
do
care
she
said
now
you
are
my
witness
miss
summerson
i
say
i
do
care
but
if
he
was
to
come
to
our
house
with
his
great
shining
lumpy
forehead
night
after
night
till
he
was
as
old
as
methuselah
i
would
have
anything
to
say
to
him
such
asses
as
he
and
ma
make
of
themselves
my
dear
i
remonstrated
in
allusion
to
the
epithet
and
the
vigorous
emphasis
miss
jellyby
set
upon
it
your
duty
as
a
child
oh
do
talk
of
duty
as
a
child
miss
summerson
where
ma
duty
as
a
parent
all
made
over
to
the
public
and
africa
i
suppose
then
let
the
public
and
africa
show
duty
as
a
child
it
much
more
their
affair
than
mine
you
are
shocked
i
dare
say
very
well
so
am
i
shocked
too
so
we
are
both
shocked
and
there
an
end
of
it
she
walked
me
on
faster
yet
but
for
all
that
i
say
again
he
may
come
and
come
and
come
and
i
wo
have
anything
to
say
to
him
i
ca
bear
him
if
there
any
stuff
in
the
world
that
i
hate
and
detest
it
the
stuff
he
and
ma
talk
i
wonder
the
very
opposite
our
house
can
have
the
patience
to
stay
there
and
be
a
witness
of
such
inconsistencies
and
contradictions
as
all
that
sounding
nonsense
and
ma
management
i
could
not
but
understand
her
to
refer
to
quale
the
young
gentleman
who
had
appeared
after
dinner
yesterday
i
was
saved
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
pursuing
the
subject
by
richard
and
ada
coming
up
at
a
round
pace
laughing
and
asking
us
if
we
meant
to
run
a
race
thus
interrupted
miss
jellyby
became
silent
and
walked
moodily
on
at
my
side
while
i
admired
the
long
successions
and
varieties
of
streets
the
quantity
of
people
already
going
to
and
fro
the
number
of
vehicles
passing
and
repassing
the
busy
preparations
in
the
setting
forth
of
shop
windows
and
the
sweeping
out
of
shops
and
the
extraordinary
creatures
in
rags
secretly
groping
among
the
rubbish
for
pins
and
other
refuse
so
cousin
said
the
cheerful
voice
of
richard
to
ada
behind
me
we
are
never
to
get
out
of
chancery
we
have
come
by
another
way
to
our
place
of
meeting
yesterday
and
by
the
great
seal
here
the
old
lady
again
truly
there
she
was
immediately
in
front
of
us
curtsying
and
smiling
and
saying
with
her
yesterday
air
of
patronage
the
wards
in
jarndyce
happy
i
am
sure
you
are
out
early
said
i
as
she
curtsied
to
me
i
usually
walk
here
early
before
the
court
sits
retired
i
collect
my
thoughts
here
for
the
business
of
the
day
said
the
old
lady
mincingly
the
business
of
the
day
requires
a
great
deal
of
thought
chancery
justice
is
so
difficult
to
follow
who
this
miss
summerson
whispered
miss
jellyby
drawing
my
arm
tighter
through
her
own
the
little
old
lady
hearing
was
remarkably
quick
she
answered
for
herself
directly
a
suitor
my
child
at
your
service
i
have
the
honour
to
attend
court
regularly
with
my
documents
have
i
the
pleasure
of
addressing
another
of
the
youthful
parties
in
jarndyce
said
the
old
lady
recovering
herself
with
her
head
on
one
side
from
a
very
low
curtsy
richard
anxious
to
atone
for
his
thoughtlessness
of
yesterday
explained
that
miss
jellyby
was
not
connected
with
the
suit
ha
said
the
old
lady
she
does
not
expect
a
judgment
she
will
still
grow
old
but
not
so
old
oh
dear
no
this
is
the
garden
of
lincoln
inn
i
call
it
my
garden
it
is
quite
a
bower
in
the
where
the
birds
sing
melodiously
i
pass
the
greater
part
of
the
long
vacation
here
in
contemplation
you
find
the
long
vacation
exceedingly
long
do
you
we
said
yes
as
she
seemed
to
expect
us
to
say
so
when
the
leaves
are
falling
from
the
trees
and
there
are
no
more
flowers
in
bloom
to
make
up
into
nosegays
for
the
lord
court
said
the
old
lady
the
vacation
is
fulfilled
and
the
sixth
seal
mentioned
in
the
revelations
again
prevails
pray
come
and
see
my
lodging
it
will
be
a
good
omen
for
me
youth
and
hope
and
beauty
are
very
seldom
there
it
is
a
long
long
time
since
i
had
a
visit
from
either
she
had
taken
my
hand
and
leading
me
and
miss
jellyby
away
beckoned
richard
and
ada
to
come
too
i
did
not
know
how
to
excuse
myself
and
looked
to
richard
for
aid
as
he
was
half
amused
and
half
curious
and
all
in
doubt
how
to
get
rid
of
the
old
lady
without
offence
she
continued
to
lead
us
away
and
he
and
ada
continued
to
follow
our
strange
conductress
informing
us
all
the
time
with
much
smiling
condescension
that
she
lived
close
by
it
was
quite
true
as
it
soon
appeared
she
lived
so
close
by
that
we
had
not
time
to
have
done
humouring
her
for
a
few
moments
before
she
was
at
home
slipping
us
out
at
a
little
side
gate
the
old
lady
stopped
most
unexpectedly
in
a
narrow
back
street
part
of
some
courts
and
lanes
immediately
outside
the
wall
of
the
inn
and
said
this
is
my
lodging
pray
walk
up
she
had
stopped
at
a
shop
over
which
was
written
krook
rag
and
bottle
warehouse
also
in
long
thin
letters
krook
dealer
in
marine
stores
in
one
part
of
the
window
was
a
picture
of
a
red
paper
mill
at
which
a
cart
was
unloading
a
quantity
of
sacks
of
old
rags
in
another
was
the
inscription
bones
bought
in
another
bought
in
another
old
iron
bought
in
another
bought
in
another
ladies
and
gentlemen
wardrobes
bought
everything
seemed
to
be
bought
and
nothing
to
be
sold
there
in
all
parts
of
the
window
were
quantities
of
dirty
bottles
blacking
bottles
medicine
bottles
and
bottles
pickle
bottles
wine
bottles
ink
bottles
i
am
reminded
by
mentioning
the
latter
that
the
shop
had
in
several
little
particulars
the
air
of
being
in
a
legal
neighbourhood
and
of
being
as
it
were
a
dirty
and
disowned
relation
of
the
law
there
were
a
great
many
ink
bottles
there
was
a
little
tottering
bench
of
shabby
old
volumes
outside
the
door
labelled
law
books
all
at
some
of
the
inscriptions
i
have
enumerated
were
written
in
like
the
papers
i
had
seen
in
kenge
and
carboy
office
and
the
letters
i
had
so
long
received
from
the
firm
among
them
was
one
in
the
same
writing
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
of
the
shop
but
announcing
that
a
respectable
man
aged
wanted
engrossing
or
copying
to
execute
with
neatness
and
dispatch
address
to
nemo
care
of
krook
within
there
were
several
bags
blue
and
red
hanging
up
a
little
way
within
the
lay
heaps
of
old
crackled
parchment
scrolls
and
discoloured
and
i
could
have
fancied
that
all
the
rusty
keys
of
which
there
must
have
been
hundreds
huddled
together
as
old
iron
had
once
belonged
to
doors
of
rooms
or
strong
chests
in
lawyers
offices
the
litter
of
rags
tumbled
partly
into
and
partly
out
of
a
wooden
scale
hanging
without
any
counterpoise
from
a
beam
might
have
been
counsellors
bands
and
gowns
torn
up
one
had
only
to
fancy
as
richard
whispered
to
ada
and
me
while
we
all
stood
looking
in
that
yonder
bones
in
a
corner
piled
together
and
picked
very
clean
were
the
bones
of
clients
to
make
the
picture
complete
as
it
was
still
foggy
and
dark
and
as
the
shop
was
blinded
besides
by
the
wall
of
lincoln
inn
intercepting
the
light
within
a
couple
of
yards
we
should
not
have
seen
so
much
but
for
a
lighted
lantern
that
an
old
man
in
spectacles
and
a
hairy
cap
was
carrying
about
in
the
shop
turning
towards
the
door
he
now
caught
sight
of
us
he
was
short
cadaverous
and
withered
with
his
head
sunk
sideways
between
his
shoulders
and
the
breath
issuing
in
visible
smoke
from
his
mouth
as
if
he
were
on
fire
within
his
throat
chin
and
eyebrows
were
so
frosted
with
white
hairs
and
so
gnarled
with
veins
and
puckered
skin
that
he
looked
from
his
breast
upward
like
some
old
root
in
a
fall
of
snow
hi
hi
said
the
old
man
coming
to
the
door
have
you
anything
to
sell
we
naturally
drew
back
and
glanced
at
our
conductress
who
had
been
trying
to
open
the
with
a
key
she
had
taken
from
her
pocket
and
to
whom
richard
now
said
that
as
we
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
where
she
lived
we
would
leave
her
being
pressed
for
time
but
she
was
not
to
be
so
easily
left
she
became
so
fantastically
and
pressingly
earnest
in
her
entreaties
that
we
would
walk
up
and
see
her
apartment
for
an
instant
and
was
so
bent
in
her
harmless
way
on
leading
me
in
as
part
of
the
good
omen
she
desired
that
i
whatever
the
others
might
do
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
comply
i
suppose
we
were
all
more
or
less
curious
at
any
rate
when
the
old
man
added
his
persuasions
to
hers
and
said
aye
aye
please
her
it
wo
take
a
minute
come
in
come
in
come
in
through
the
shop
if
door
out
of
order
we
all
went
in
stimulated
by
richard
laughing
encouragement
and
relying
on
his
protection
my
landlord
krook
said
the
little
old
lady
condescending
to
him
from
her
lofty
station
as
she
presented
him
to
us
he
is
called
among
the
neighbours
the
lord
chancellor
his
shop
is
called
the
court
of
chancery
he
is
a
very
eccentric
person
he
is
very
odd
oh
i
assure
you
he
is
very
odd
she
shook
her
head
a
great
many
times
and
tapped
her
forehead
with
her
finger
to
express
to
us
that
we
must
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
him
for
he
is
a
little
you
know
m
said
the
old
lady
with
great
stateliness
the
old
man
overheard
and
laughed
it
true
enough
he
said
going
before
us
with
the
lantern
that
they
call
me
the
lord
chancellor
and
call
my
shop
chancery
and
why
do
you
think
they
call
me
the
lord
chancellor
and
my
shop
chancery
i
do
know
i
am
sure
said
richard
rather
carelessly
you
see
said
the
old
man
stopping
and
turning
round
they
hi
here
lovely
hair
i
have
got
three
sacks
of
ladies
hair
below
but
none
so
beautiful
and
fine
as
this
what
colour
and
what
texture
that
do
my
good
friend
said
richard
strongly
disapproving
of
his
having
drawn
one
of
ada
tresses
through
his
yellow
hand
you
can
admire
as
the
rest
of
us
do
without
taking
that
liberty
the
old
man
darted
at
him
a
sudden
look
which
even
called
my
attention
from
ada
who
startled
and
blushing
was
so
remarkably
beautiful
that
she
seemed
to
fix
the
wandering
attention
of
the
little
old
lady
herself
but
as
ada
interposed
and
laughingly
said
she
could
only
feel
proud
of
such
genuine
admiration
krook
shrunk
into
his
former
self
as
suddenly
as
he
had
leaped
out
of
it
you
see
i
have
so
many
things
here
he
resumed
holding
up
the
lantern
of
so
many
kinds
and
all
as
the
neighbours
think
but
they
know
nothing
wasting
away
and
going
to
rack
and
ruin
that
why
they
have
given
me
and
my
place
a
christening
and
i
have
so
many
old
parchmentses
and
papers
in
my
stock
and
i
have
a
liking
for
rust
and
must
and
cobwebs
and
all
fish
that
comes
to
my
net
and
i
ca
abear
to
part
with
anything
i
once
lay
hold
of
or
so
my
neighbours
think
but
what
do
they
know
or
to
alter
anything
or
to
have
any
sweeping
nor
scouring
nor
cleaning
nor
repairing
going
on
about
me
that
the
way
i
got
the
ill
name
of
chancery
i
mind
i
go
to
see
my
noble
and
learned
brother
pretty
well
every
day
when
he
sits
in
the
inn
he
do
notice
me
but
i
notice
him
there
no
great
odds
betwixt
us
we
both
grub
on
in
a
muddle
hi
lady
jane
a
large
grey
cat
leaped
from
some
neighbouring
shelf
on
his
shoulder
and
startled
us
all
hi
show
how
you
scratch
hi
tear
my
lady
said
her
master
the
cat
leaped
down
and
ripped
at
a
bundle
of
rags
with
her
tigerish
claws
with
a
sound
that
it
set
my
teeth
on
edge
to
hear
she
do
as
much
for
any
one
i
was
to
set
her
on
said
the
old
man
i
deal
in
among
other
general
matters
and
hers
was
offered
to
me
it
a
very
fine
skin
as
you
may
see
but
i
have
it
stripped
off
that
war
like
chancery
practice
though
says
you
he
had
by
this
time
led
us
across
the
shop
and
now
opened
a
door
in
the
back
part
of
it
leading
to
the
as
he
stood
with
his
hand
upon
the
lock
the
little
old
lady
graciously
observed
to
him
before
passing
out
that
will
do
krook
you
mean
well
but
are
tiresome
my
young
friends
are
pressed
for
time
i
have
none
to
spare
myself
having
to
attend
court
very
soon
my
young
friends
are
the
wards
in
jarndyce
jarndyce
said
the
old
man
with
a
start
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
the
great
suit
krook
returned
his
lodger
hi
exclaimed
the
old
man
in
a
tone
of
thoughtful
amazement
and
with
a
wider
stare
than
before
think
of
it
he
seemed
so
rapt
all
in
a
moment
and
looked
so
curiously
at
us
that
richard
said
why
you
appear
to
trouble
yourself
a
good
deal
about
the
causes
before
your
noble
and
learned
brother
the
other
chancellor
yes
said
the
old
man
abstractedly
sure
your
name
now
will
be
richard
carstone
carstone
he
repeated
slowly
checking
off
that
name
upon
his
forefinger
and
each
of
the
others
he
went
on
to
mention
upon
a
separate
finger
yes
there
was
the
name
of
barbary
and
the
name
of
clare
and
the
name
of
dedlock
too
i
think
he
knows
as
much
of
the
cause
as
the
real
salaried
chancellor
said
richard
quite
astonished
to
ada
and
me
aye
said
the
old
man
coming
slowly
out
of
his
abstraction
yes
tom
jarndyce
you
excuse
me
being
related
but
he
was
never
known
about
court
by
any
other
name
and
was
as
well
known
there
as
she
is
now
nodding
slightly
at
his
lodger
tom
jarndyce
was
often
in
here
he
got
into
a
restless
habit
of
strolling
about
when
the
cause
was
on
or
expected
talking
to
the
little
shopkeepers
and
telling
to
keep
out
of
chancery
whatever
they
did
says
he
being
ground
to
bits
in
a
slow
mill
it
being
roasted
at
a
slow
fire
it
being
stung
to
death
by
single
bees
it
being
drowned
by
drops
it
going
mad
by
grains
he
was
as
near
making
away
with
himself
just
where
the
young
lady
stands
as
near
could
be
we
listened
with
horror
he
come
in
at
the
door
said
the
old
man
slowly
pointing
an
imaginary
track
along
the
shop
on
the
day
he
did
it
the
whole
neighbourhood
had
said
for
months
before
that
he
would
do
it
of
a
certainty
sooner
or
later
he
come
in
at
the
door
that
day
and
walked
along
there
and
sat
himself
on
a
bench
that
stood
there
and
asked
me
you
judge
i
was
a
mortal
sight
younger
then
to
fetch
him
a
pint
of
wine
says
he
i
am
much
depressed
my
cause
is
on
again
and
i
think
i
nearer
judgment
than
i
ever
was
i
had
a
mind
to
leave
him
alone
and
i
persuaded
him
to
go
to
the
tavern
over
the
way
there
side
my
lane
i
mean
chancery
lane
and
i
followed
and
looked
in
at
the
window
and
saw
him
comfortable
as
i
thought
in
the
by
the
fire
and
company
with
him
i
had
hardly
got
back
here
when
i
heard
a
shot
go
echoing
and
rattling
right
away
into
the
inn
i
ran
out
neighbours
ran
out
twenty
of
us
cried
at
once
jarndyce
the
old
man
stopped
looked
hard
at
us
looked
down
into
the
lantern
blew
the
light
out
and
shut
the
lantern
up
we
were
right
i
need
tell
the
present
hearers
hi
to
be
sure
how
the
neighbourhood
poured
into
court
that
afternoon
while
the
cause
was
on
how
my
noble
and
learned
brother
and
all
the
rest
of
grubbed
and
muddled
away
as
usual
and
tried
to
look
as
if
they
had
heard
a
word
of
the
last
fact
in
the
case
or
as
if
they
had
oh
dear
me
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
if
they
had
heard
of
it
by
any
chance
ada
colour
had
entirely
left
her
and
richard
was
scarcely
less
pale
nor
could
i
wonder
judging
even
from
my
emotions
and
i
was
no
party
in
the
suit
that
to
hearts
so
untried
and
fresh
it
was
a
shock
to
come
into
the
inheritance
of
a
protracted
misery
attended
in
the
minds
of
many
people
with
such
dreadful
recollections
i
had
another
uneasiness
in
the
application
of
the
painful
story
to
the
poor
creature
who
had
brought
us
there
but
to
my
surprise
she
seemed
perfectly
unconscious
of
that
and
only
led
the
way
upstairs
again
informing
us
with
the
toleration
of
a
superior
creature
for
the
infirmities
of
a
common
mortal
that
her
landlord
was
a
little
m
you
know
she
lived
at
the
top
of
the
house
in
a
pretty
large
room
from
which
she
had
a
glimpse
of
lincoln
inn
hall
this
seemed
to
have
been
her
principal
inducement
originally
for
taking
up
her
residence
there
she
could
look
at
it
she
said
in
the
night
especially
in
the
moonshine
her
room
was
clean
but
very
very
bare
i
noticed
the
scantiest
necessaries
in
the
way
of
furniture
a
few
old
prints
from
books
of
chancellors
and
barristers
wafered
against
the
wall
and
some
reticles
and
containing
documents
as
she
informed
us
there
were
neither
coals
nor
ashes
in
the
grate
and
i
saw
no
articles
of
clothing
anywhere
nor
any
kind
of
food
upon
a
shelf
in
an
open
cupboard
were
a
plate
or
two
a
cup
or
two
and
so
forth
but
all
dry
and
empty
there
was
a
more
affecting
meaning
in
her
pinched
appearance
i
thought
as
i
looked
round
than
i
had
understood
before
extremely
honoured
i
am
sure
said
our
poor
hostess
with
the
greatest
suavity
by
this
visit
from
the
wards
in
jarndyce
and
very
much
indebted
for
the
omen
it
is
a
retired
situation
considering
i
am
limited
as
to
situation
in
consequence
of
the
necessity
of
attending
on
the
chancellor
i
have
lived
here
many
years
i
pass
my
days
in
court
my
evenings
and
my
nights
here
i
find
the
nights
long
for
i
sleep
but
little
and
think
much
that
is
of
course
unavoidable
being
in
chancery
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
offer
chocolate
i
expect
a
judgment
shortly
and
shall
then
place
my
establishment
on
a
superior
footing
at
present
i
do
mind
confessing
to
the
wards
in
jarndyce
in
strict
confidence
that
i
sometimes
find
it
difficult
to
keep
up
a
genteel
appearance
i
have
felt
the
cold
here
i
have
felt
something
sharper
than
cold
it
matters
very
little
pray
excuse
the
introduction
of
such
mean
topics
she
partly
drew
aside
the
curtain
of
the
long
low
garret
window
and
called
our
attention
to
a
number
of
hanging
there
some
containing
several
birds
there
were
larks
linnets
and
goldfinches
i
should
think
at
least
twenty
i
began
to
keep
the
little
creatures
she
said
with
an
object
that
the
wards
will
readily
comprehend
with
the
intention
of
restoring
them
to
liberty
when
my
judgment
should
be
given
they
die
in
prison
though
their
lives
poor
silly
things
are
so
short
in
comparison
with
chancery
proceedings
that
one
by
one
the
whole
collection
has
died
over
and
over
again
i
doubt
do
you
know
whether
one
of
these
though
they
are
all
young
will
live
to
be
free
mortifying
is
it
not
although
she
sometimes
asked
a
question
she
never
seemed
to
expect
a
reply
but
rambled
on
as
if
she
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
when
no
one
but
herself
was
present
indeed
she
pursued
i
positively
doubt
sometimes
i
do
assure
you
whether
while
matters
are
still
unsettled
and
the
sixth
or
great
seal
still
prevails
i
may
not
one
day
be
found
lying
stark
and
senseless
here
as
i
have
found
so
many
birds
richard
answering
what
he
saw
in
ada
compassionate
eyes
took
the
opportunity
of
laying
some
money
softly
and
unobserved
on
the
we
all
drew
nearer
to
the
cages
feigning
to
examine
the
birds
i
ca
allow
them
to
sing
much
said
the
little
old
lady
for
you
think
this
curious
i
find
my
mind
confused
by
the
idea
that
they
are
singing
while
i
am
following
the
arguments
in
court
and
my
mind
requires
to
be
so
very
clear
you
know
another
time
i
tell
you
their
names
not
at
present
on
a
day
of
such
good
omen
they
shall
sing
as
much
as
they
like
in
honour
of
youth
a
smile
and
curtsy
hope
a
smile
and
curtsy
and
beauty
a
smile
and
curtsy
there
we
let
in
the
full
light
the
birds
began
to
stir
and
chirp
i
can
not
admit
the
air
freely
said
the
little
old
lady
the
room
was
close
and
would
have
been
the
better
for
it
because
the
cat
you
saw
downstairs
called
lady
jane
is
greedy
for
their
lives
she
crouches
on
the
parapet
outside
for
hours
and
hours
i
have
discovered
whispering
mysteriously
that
her
natural
cruelty
is
sharpened
by
a
jealous
fear
of
their
regaining
their
liberty
in
consequence
of
the
judgment
i
expect
being
shortly
given
she
is
sly
and
full
of
malice
i
half
believe
sometimes
that
she
is
no
cat
but
the
wolf
of
the
old
saying
it
is
so
very
difficult
to
keep
her
from
the
door
some
neighbouring
bells
reminding
the
poor
soul
that
it
was
nine
did
more
for
us
in
the
way
of
bringing
our
visit
to
an
end
than
we
could
easily
have
done
for
ourselves
she
hurriedly
took
up
her
little
bag
of
documents
which
she
had
laid
upon
the
table
on
coming
in
and
asked
if
we
were
also
going
into
court
on
our
answering
no
and
that
we
would
on
no
account
detain
her
she
opened
the
door
to
attend
us
downstairs
with
such
an
omen
it
is
even
more
necessary
than
usual
that
i
should
be
there
before
the
chancellor
comes
in
said
she
for
he
might
mention
my
case
the
first
thing
i
have
a
presentiment
that
he
will
mention
it
the
first
thing
this
morning
she
stopped
to
tell
us
in
a
whisper
as
we
were
going
down
that
the
whole
house
was
filled
with
strange
lumber
which
her
landlord
had
bought
piecemeal
and
had
no
wish
to
sell
in
consequence
of
being
a
little
this
was
on
the
first
floor
but
she
had
made
a
previous
stoppage
on
the
second
floor
and
had
silently
pointed
at
a
dark
door
there
the
only
other
lodger
she
now
whispered
in
explanation
a
the
children
in
the
lanes
here
say
he
has
sold
himself
to
the
devil
i
do
know
what
he
can
have
done
with
the
money
hush
she
appeared
to
mistrust
that
the
lodger
might
hear
her
even
there
and
repeating
hush
went
before
us
on
tiptoe
as
though
even
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
might
reveal
to
him
what
she
had
said
passing
through
the
shop
on
our
way
out
as
we
had
passed
through
it
on
our
way
in
we
found
the
old
man
storing
a
quantity
of
packets
of
in
a
kind
of
well
in
the
floor
he
seemed
to
be
working
hard
with
the
perspiration
standing
on
his
forehead
and
had
a
piece
of
chalk
by
him
with
which
as
he
put
each
separate
package
or
bundle
down
he
made
a
crooked
mark
on
the
panelling
of
the
wall
richard
and
ada
and
miss
jellyby
and
the
little
old
lady
had
gone
by
him
and
i
was
going
when
he
touched
me
on
the
arm
to
stay
me
and
chalked
the
letter
j
upon
the
wall
in
a
very
curious
manner
beginning
with
the
end
of
the
letter
and
shaping
it
backward
it
was
a
capital
letter
not
a
printed
one
but
just
such
a
letter
as
any
clerk
in
kenge
and
carboy
office
would
have
made
can
you
read
it
he
asked
me
with
a
keen
glance
surely
said
i
it
very
plain
what
is
it
j
with
another
glance
at
me
and
a
glance
at
the
door
he
rubbed
it
out
and
turned
an
a
in
its
place
not
a
capital
letter
this
time
and
said
what
that
i
told
him
he
then
rubbed
that
out
and
turned
the
letter
r
and
asked
me
the
same
question
he
went
on
quickly
until
he
had
formed
in
the
same
curious
manner
beginning
at
the
ends
and
bottoms
of
the
letters
the
word
jarndyce
without
once
leaving
two
letters
on
the
wall
together
what
does
that
spell
he
asked
me
when
i
told
him
he
laughed
in
the
same
odd
way
yet
with
the
same
rapidity
he
then
produced
singly
and
rubbed
out
singly
the
letters
forming
the
words
bleak
house
these
in
some
astonishment
i
also
read
and
he
laughed
again
hi
said
the
old
man
laying
aside
the
chalk
i
have
a
turn
for
copying
from
memory
you
see
miss
though
i
can
neither
read
nor
write
he
looked
so
disagreeable
and
his
cat
looked
so
wickedly
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
of
the
birds
upstairs
that
i
was
quite
relieved
by
richard
appearing
at
the
door
and
saying
miss
summerson
i
hope
you
are
not
bargaining
for
the
sale
of
your
hair
do
be
tempted
three
sacks
below
are
quite
enough
for
mr
krook
i
lost
no
time
in
wishing
krook
good
morning
and
joining
my
friends
outside
where
we
parted
with
the
little
old
lady
who
gave
us
her
blessing
with
great
ceremony
and
renewed
her
assurance
of
yesterday
in
reference
to
her
intention
of
settling
estates
on
ada
and
me
before
we
finally
turned
out
of
those
lanes
we
looked
back
and
saw
krook
standing
at
his
in
his
spectacles
looking
after
us
with
his
cat
upon
his
shoulder
and
her
tail
sticking
up
on
one
side
of
his
hairy
cap
like
a
tall
feather
quite
an
adventure
for
a
morning
in
london
said
richard
with
a
sigh
ah
cousin
cousin
it
a
weary
word
this
chancery
it
is
to
me
and
has
been
ever
since
i
can
remember
returned
ada
i
am
grieved
that
i
should
be
the
enemy
as
i
suppose
i
am
of
a
great
number
of
relations
and
others
and
that
they
should
be
my
enemies
as
i
suppose
they
are
and
that
we
should
all
be
ruining
one
another
without
knowing
how
or
why
and
be
in
constant
doubt
and
discord
all
our
lives
it
seems
very
strange
as
there
must
be
right
somewhere
that
an
honest
judge
in
real
earnest
has
not
been
able
to
find
out
through
all
these
years
where
it
is
ah
cousin
said
richard
strange
indeed
all
this
wasteful
wanton
is
very
strange
to
see
that
composed
court
yesterday
jogging
on
so
serenely
and
to
think
of
the
wretchedness
of
the
pieces
on
the
board
gave
me
the
headache
and
the
heartache
both
together
my
head
ached
with
wondering
how
it
happened
if
men
were
neither
fools
nor
rascals
and
my
heart
ached
to
think
they
could
possibly
be
either
but
at
all
events
ada
i
may
call
you
ada
of
course
you
may
cousin
richard
at
all
events
chancery
will
work
none
of
its
bad
influences
on
us
we
have
happily
been
brought
together
thanks
to
our
good
kinsman
and
it
ca
divide
us
now
never
i
hope
cousin
richard
said
ada
gently
miss
jellyby
gave
my
arm
a
squeeze
and
me
a
very
significant
look
i
smiled
in
return
and
we
made
the
rest
of
the
way
back
very
pleasantly
in
half
an
hour
after
our
arrival
jellyby
appeared
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
the
various
things
necessary
for
breakfast
straggled
one
by
one
into
the
i
do
not
doubt
that
jellyby
had
gone
to
bed
and
got
up
in
the
usual
manner
but
she
presented
no
appearance
of
having
changed
her
dress
she
was
greatly
occupied
during
breakfast
for
the
morning
post
brought
a
heavy
correspondence
relative
to
which
would
occasion
her
she
said
to
pass
a
busy
day
the
children
tumbled
about
and
notched
memoranda
of
their
accidents
in
their
legs
which
were
perfect
little
calendars
of
distress
and
peepy
was
lost
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
brought
home
from
newgate
market
by
a
policeman
the
equable
manner
in
which
jellyby
sustained
both
his
absence
and
his
restoration
to
the
family
circle
surprised
us
all
she
was
by
that
time
perseveringly
dictating
to
caddy
and
caddy
was
fast
relapsing
into
the
inky
condition
in
which
we
had
found
her
at
one
an
open
carriage
arrived
for
us
and
a
cart
for
our
luggage
jellyby
charged
us
with
many
remembrances
to
her
good
friend
jarndyce
caddy
left
her
desk
to
see
us
depart
kissed
me
in
the
passage
and
stood
biting
her
pen
and
sobbing
on
the
steps
peepy
i
am
happy
to
say
was
asleep
and
spared
the
pain
of
separation
i
was
not
without
misgivings
that
he
had
gone
to
newgate
market
in
search
of
me
and
all
the
other
children
got
up
behind
the
barouche
and
fell
off
and
we
saw
them
with
great
concern
scattered
over
the
surface
of
thavies
inn
as
we
rolled
out
of
its
precincts
chapter
vi
quite
at
home
the
day
had
brightened
very
much
and
still
brightened
as
we
went
westward
we
went
our
way
through
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
air
wondering
more
and
more
at
the
extent
of
the
streets
the
brilliancy
of
the
shops
the
great
traffic
and
the
crowds
of
people
whom
the
pleasanter
weather
seemed
to
have
brought
out
like
flowers
by
and
by
we
began
to
leave
the
wonderful
city
and
to
proceed
through
suburbs
which
of
themselves
would
have
made
a
pretty
large
town
in
my
eyes
and
at
last
we
got
into
a
real
country
road
again
with
windmills
milestones
farmers
waggons
scents
of
old
hay
swinging
signs
and
horse
troughs
trees
fields
and
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
green
landscape
before
us
and
the
immense
metropolis
behind
and
when
a
waggon
with
a
train
of
beautiful
horses
furnished
with
red
trappings
and
bells
came
by
us
with
its
music
i
believe
we
could
all
three
have
sung
to
the
bells
so
cheerful
were
the
influences
around
the
whole
road
has
been
reminding
me
of
my
namesake
whittington
said
richard
and
that
waggon
is
the
finishing
touch
halloa
the
matter
we
had
stopped
and
the
waggon
had
stopped
too
its
music
changed
as
the
horses
came
to
a
stand
and
subsided
to
a
gentle
tinkling
except
when
a
horse
tossed
his
head
or
shook
himself
and
sprinkled
off
a
little
shower
of
our
postilion
is
looking
after
the
waggoner
said
richard
and
the
waggoner
is
coming
back
after
us
good
day
friend
the
waggoner
was
at
our
why
here
an
extraordinary
thing
added
richard
looking
closely
at
the
man
he
has
got
your
name
ada
in
his
hat
he
had
all
our
names
in
his
hat
tucked
within
the
band
were
three
small
notes
one
addressed
to
ada
one
to
richard
one
to
me
these
the
waggoner
delivered
to
each
of
us
respectively
reading
the
name
aloud
first
in
answer
to
richard
inquiry
from
whom
they
came
he
briefly
answered
master
sir
if
you
please
and
putting
on
his
hat
again
which
was
like
a
soft
bowl
cracked
his
whip
his
music
and
went
melodiously
away
is
that
jarndyce
waggon
said
richard
calling
to
our
yes
sir
he
replied
going
to
london
we
opened
the
notes
each
was
a
counterpart
of
the
other
and
contained
these
words
in
a
solid
plain
hand
i
look
forward
my
dear
to
our
meeting
easily
and
without
constraint
on
either
side
i
therefore
have
to
propose
that
we
meet
as
old
friends
and
take
the
past
for
granted
it
will
be
a
relief
to
you
possibly
and
to
me
certainly
and
so
my
love
to
you
john
jarndyce
i
had
perhaps
less
reason
to
be
surprised
than
either
of
my
companions
having
never
yet
enjoyed
an
opportunity
of
thanking
one
who
had
been
my
benefactor
and
sole
earthly
dependence
through
so
many
years
i
had
not
considered
how
i
could
thank
him
my
gratitude
lying
too
deep
in
my
heart
for
that
but
i
now
began
to
consider
how
i
could
meet
him
without
thanking
him
and
felt
it
would
be
very
difficult
indeed
the
notes
revived
in
richard
and
ada
a
general
impression
that
they
both
had
without
quite
knowing
how
they
came
by
it
that
their
cousin
jarndyce
could
never
bear
acknowledgments
for
any
kindness
he
performed
and
that
sooner
than
receive
any
he
would
resort
to
the
most
singular
expedients
and
evasions
or
would
even
run
away
ada
dimly
remembered
to
have
heard
her
mother
tell
when
she
was
a
very
little
child
that
he
had
once
done
her
an
act
of
uncommon
generosity
and
that
on
her
going
to
his
house
to
thank
him
he
happened
to
see
her
through
a
window
coming
to
the
door
and
immediately
escaped
by
the
back
gate
and
was
not
heard
of
for
three
months
this
discourse
led
to
a
great
deal
more
on
the
same
theme
and
indeed
it
lasted
us
all
day
and
we
talked
of
scarcely
anything
else
if
we
did
by
any
chance
diverge
into
another
subject
we
soon
returned
to
this
and
wondered
what
the
house
would
be
like
and
when
we
should
get
there
and
whether
we
should
see
jarndyce
as
soon
as
we
arrived
or
after
a
delay
and
what
he
would
say
to
us
and
what
we
should
say
to
him
all
of
which
we
wondered
about
over
and
over
again
the
roads
were
very
heavy
for
the
horses
but
the
pathway
was
generally
good
so
we
alighted
and
walked
up
all
the
hills
and
liked
it
so
well
that
we
prolonged
our
walk
on
the
level
ground
when
we
got
to
the
top
at
barnet
there
were
other
horses
waiting
for
us
but
as
they
had
only
just
been
fed
we
had
to
wait
for
them
too
and
got
a
long
fresh
walk
over
a
common
and
an
old
before
the
carriage
came
up
these
delays
so
protracted
the
journey
that
the
short
day
was
spent
and
the
long
night
had
closed
in
before
we
came
to
albans
near
to
which
town
bleak
house
was
we
knew
by
that
time
we
were
so
anxious
and
nervous
that
even
richard
confessed
as
we
rattled
over
the
stones
of
the
old
street
to
feeling
an
irrational
desire
to
drive
back
again
as
to
ada
and
me
whom
he
had
wrapped
up
with
great
care
the
night
being
sharp
and
frosty
we
trembled
from
head
to
foot
when
we
turned
out
of
the
town
round
a
corner
and
richard
told
us
that
the
who
had
for
a
long
time
sympathized
with
our
heightened
expectation
was
looking
back
and
nodding
we
both
stood
up
in
the
carriage
richard
holding
ada
lest
she
should
be
jolted
down
and
gazed
round
upon
the
open
country
and
the
starlight
night
for
our
destination
there
was
a
light
sparkling
on
the
top
of
a
hill
before
us
and
the
driver
pointing
to
it
with
his
whip
and
crying
that
bleak
house
put
his
horses
into
a
canter
and
took
us
forward
at
such
a
rate
uphill
though
it
was
that
the
wheels
sent
the
road
drift
flying
about
our
heads
like
spray
from
a
presently
we
lost
the
light
presently
saw
it
presently
lost
it
presently
saw
it
and
turned
into
an
avenue
of
trees
and
cantered
up
towards
where
it
was
beaming
brightly
it
was
in
a
window
of
what
seemed
to
be
an
house
with
three
peaks
in
the
roof
in
front
and
a
circular
sweep
leading
to
the
porch
a
bell
was
rung
as
we
drew
up
and
amidst
the
sound
of
its
deep
voice
in
the
still
air
and
the
distant
barking
of
some
dogs
and
a
gush
of
light
from
the
opened
door
and
the
smoking
and
steaming
of
the
heated
horses
and
the
quickened
beating
of
our
own
hearts
we
alighted
in
no
inconsiderable
confusion
ada
my
love
esther
my
dear
you
are
welcome
i
rejoice
to
see
you
rick
if
i
had
a
hand
to
spare
at
present
i
would
give
it
you
the
gentleman
who
said
these
words
in
a
clear
bright
hospitable
voice
had
one
of
his
arms
round
ada
waist
and
the
other
round
mine
and
kissed
us
both
in
a
fatherly
way
and
bore
us
across
the
hall
into
a
ruddy
little
room
all
in
a
glow
with
a
blazing
fire
here
he
kissed
us
again
and
opening
his
arms
made
us
sit
down
side
by
side
on
a
sofa
ready
drawn
out
near
the
hearth
i
felt
that
if
we
had
been
at
all
demonstrative
he
would
have
run
away
in
a
moment
now
rick
said
he
i
have
a
hand
at
liberty
a
word
in
earnest
is
as
good
as
a
speech
i
am
heartily
glad
to
see
you
you
are
at
home
warm
yourself
richard
shook
him
by
both
hands
with
an
intuitive
mixture
of
respect
and
frankness
and
only
saying
though
with
an
earnestness
that
rather
alarmed
me
i
was
so
afraid
of
jarndyce
suddenly
disappearing
you
are
very
kind
sir
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
laid
aside
his
hat
and
coat
and
came
up
to
the
fire
and
how
did
you
like
the
ride
and
how
did
you
like
jellyby
my
dear
said
jarndyce
to
ada
while
ada
was
speaking
to
him
in
reply
i
glanced
i
need
not
say
with
how
much
interest
at
his
face
it
was
a
handsome
lively
quick
face
full
of
change
and
motion
and
his
hair
was
a
silvered
i
took
him
to
be
nearer
sixty
than
fifty
but
he
was
upright
hearty
and
robust
from
the
moment
of
his
first
speaking
to
us
his
voice
had
connected
itself
with
an
association
in
my
mind
that
i
could
not
define
but
now
all
at
once
a
something
sudden
in
his
manner
and
a
pleasant
expression
in
his
eyes
recalled
the
gentleman
in
the
stagecoach
six
years
ago
on
the
memorable
day
of
my
journey
to
reading
i
was
certain
it
was
he
i
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
life
as
when
i
made
the
discovery
for
he
caught
my
glance
and
appearing
to
read
my
thoughts
gave
such
a
look
at
the
door
that
i
thought
we
had
lost
him
however
i
am
happy
to
say
he
remained
where
he
was
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
jellyby
she
exerts
herself
very
much
for
africa
sir
i
said
nobly
returned
jarndyce
but
you
answer
like
ada
whom
i
had
not
heard
you
all
think
something
else
i
see
we
rather
thought
said
i
glancing
at
richard
and
ada
who
entreated
me
with
their
eyes
to
speak
that
perhaps
she
was
a
little
unmindful
of
her
home
floored
cried
jarndyce
i
was
rather
alarmed
again
well
i
want
to
know
your
real
thoughts
my
dear
i
may
have
sent
you
there
on
purpose
we
thought
that
perhaps
said
i
hesitating
it
is
right
to
begin
with
the
obligations
of
home
sir
and
that
perhaps
while
those
are
overlooked
and
neglected
no
other
duties
can
possibly
be
substituted
for
them
the
little
jellybys
said
richard
coming
to
my
relief
are
really
i
ca
help
expressing
myself
strongly
sir
in
a
devil
of
a
state
she
means
well
said
jarndyce
hastily
the
wind
in
the
east
it
was
in
the
north
sir
as
we
came
down
observed
richard
my
dear
rick
said
jarndyce
poking
the
fire
i
take
an
oath
it
either
in
the
east
or
going
to
be
i
am
always
conscious
of
an
uncomfortable
sensation
now
and
then
when
the
wind
is
blowing
in
the
east
rheumatism
sir
said
richard
i
dare
say
it
is
rick
i
believe
it
is
and
so
the
little
jell
i
had
my
doubts
about
are
in
a
oh
lord
yes
it
easterly
said
jarndyce
he
had
taken
two
or
three
undecided
turns
up
and
down
while
uttering
these
broken
sentences
retaining
the
poker
in
one
hand
and
rubbing
his
hair
with
the
other
with
a
vexation
at
once
so
whimsical
and
so
lovable
that
i
am
sure
we
were
more
delighted
with
him
than
we
could
possibly
have
expressed
in
any
words
he
gave
an
arm
to
ada
and
an
arm
to
me
and
bidding
richard
bring
a
candle
was
leading
the
way
out
when
he
suddenly
turned
us
all
back
again
those
little
jellybys
could
you
did
you
now
if
it
had
rained
or
raspberry
tarts
or
anything
of
that
sort
said
jarndyce
oh
cousin
ada
hastily
began
good
my
pretty
pet
i
like
cousin
cousin
john
perhaps
is
better
then
cousin
john
ada
laughingly
began
again
ha
ha
very
good
indeed
said
jarndyce
with
great
enjoyment
sounds
uncommonly
natural
yes
my
dear
it
did
better
than
that
it
rained
esther
aye
said
jarndyce
what
did
esther
do
why
cousin
john
said
ada
clasping
her
hands
upon
his
arm
and
shaking
her
head
at
me
across
him
for
i
wanted
her
to
be
quiet
esther
was
their
friend
directly
esther
nursed
them
coaxed
them
to
sleep
washed
and
dressed
them
told
them
stories
kept
them
quiet
bought
them
keepsakes
my
dear
girl
i
had
only
gone
out
with
peepy
after
he
was
found
and
given
him
a
little
tiny
horse
and
cousin
john
she
softened
poor
caroline
the
eldest
one
so
much
and
was
so
thoughtful
for
me
and
so
amiable
no
no
i
wo
be
contradicted
esther
dear
you
know
you
know
it
true
the
darling
leaned
across
her
cousin
john
and
kissed
me
and
then
looking
up
in
his
face
boldly
said
at
all
events
cousin
john
i
will
thank
you
for
the
companion
you
have
given
me
i
felt
as
if
she
challenged
him
to
run
away
but
he
did
where
did
you
say
the
wind
was
rick
asked
jarndyce
in
the
north
as
we
came
down
sir
you
are
right
there
no
east
in
it
a
mistake
of
mine
come
girls
come
and
see
your
home
it
was
one
of
those
delightfully
irregular
houses
where
you
go
up
and
down
steps
out
of
one
room
into
another
and
where
you
come
upon
more
rooms
when
you
think
you
have
seen
all
there
are
and
where
there
is
a
bountiful
provision
of
little
halls
and
passages
and
where
you
find
still
older
in
unexpected
places
with
lattice
windows
and
green
growth
pressing
through
them
mine
which
we
entered
first
was
of
this
kind
with
an
roof
that
had
more
corners
in
it
than
i
ever
counted
afterwards
and
a
chimney
there
was
a
wood
fire
on
the
hearth
paved
all
around
with
pure
white
tiles
in
every
one
of
which
a
bright
miniature
of
the
fire
was
blazing
out
of
this
room
you
went
down
two
steps
into
a
charming
little
looking
down
upon
a
which
room
was
henceforth
to
belong
to
ada
and
me
out
of
this
you
went
up
three
steps
into
ada
bedroom
which
had
a
fine
broad
window
commanding
a
beautiful
view
we
saw
a
great
expanse
of
darkness
lying
underneath
the
stars
to
which
there
was
a
hollow
in
which
with
a
three
dear
adas
might
have
been
lost
at
once
out
of
this
room
you
passed
into
a
little
gallery
with
which
the
other
best
rooms
only
two
communicated
and
so
by
a
little
staircase
of
shallow
steps
with
a
number
of
corner
stairs
in
it
considering
its
length
down
into
the
hall
but
if
instead
of
going
out
at
ada
door
you
came
back
into
my
room
and
went
out
at
the
door
by
which
you
had
entered
it
and
turned
up
a
few
crooked
steps
that
branched
off
in
an
unexpected
manner
from
the
stairs
you
lost
yourself
in
passages
with
mangles
in
them
and
tables
and
a
native
hindu
chair
which
was
also
a
sofa
a
box
and
a
bedstead
and
looked
in
every
form
something
between
a
bamboo
skeleton
and
a
great
and
had
been
brought
from
india
nobody
knew
by
whom
or
when
from
these
you
came
on
richard
room
which
was
part
library
part
part
bedroom
and
seemed
indeed
a
comfortable
compound
of
many
rooms
out
of
that
you
went
straight
with
a
little
interval
of
passage
to
the
plain
room
where
jarndyce
slept
all
the
year
round
with
his
window
open
his
bedstead
without
any
furniture
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
for
more
air
and
his
cold
bath
gaping
for
him
in
a
smaller
room
adjoining
out
of
that
you
came
into
another
passage
where
there
were
and
where
you
could
hear
the
horses
being
rubbed
down
outside
the
stable
and
being
told
to
hold
up
and
get
over
as
they
slipped
about
very
much
on
the
uneven
stones
or
you
might
if
you
came
out
at
another
door
every
room
had
at
least
two
doors
go
straight
down
to
the
hall
again
by
steps
and
a
low
archway
wondering
how
you
got
back
there
or
had
ever
got
out
of
it
the
furniture
rather
than
old
like
the
house
was
as
pleasantly
irregular
ada
was
all
flowers
in
chintz
and
paper
in
velvet
in
needlework
in
the
brocade
of
two
stiff
courtly
chairs
which
stood
each
attended
by
a
little
page
of
a
stool
for
greater
state
on
either
side
of
the
our
was
green
and
had
framed
and
glazed
upon
the
walls
numbers
of
surprising
and
surprised
birds
staring
out
of
pictures
at
a
real
trout
in
a
case
as
brown
and
shining
as
if
it
had
been
served
with
gravy
at
the
death
of
captain
cook
and
at
the
whole
process
of
preparing
tea
in
china
as
depicted
by
chinese
artists
in
my
room
there
were
oval
engravings
of
the
months
ladies
haymaking
in
short
waists
and
large
hats
tied
under
the
chin
for
june
noblemen
pointing
with
to
village
steeples
for
october
portraits
in
crayons
abounded
all
through
the
house
but
were
so
dispersed
that
i
found
the
brother
of
a
youthful
officer
of
mine
in
the
and
the
grey
old
age
of
my
pretty
young
bride
with
a
flower
in
her
bodice
in
the
as
substitutes
i
had
four
angels
of
queen
anne
reign
taking
a
complacent
gentleman
to
heaven
in
festoons
with
some
difficulty
and
a
composition
in
needlework
representing
fruit
a
kettle
and
an
alphabet
all
the
movables
from
the
wardrobes
to
the
chairs
and
tables
hangings
glasses
even
to
the
pincushions
and
on
the
displayed
the
same
quaint
variety
they
agreed
in
nothing
but
their
perfect
neatness
their
display
of
the
whitest
linen
and
their
wheresoever
the
existence
of
a
drawer
small
or
large
rendered
it
possible
of
quantities
of
and
sweet
lavender
such
with
its
illuminated
windows
softened
here
and
there
by
shadows
of
curtains
shining
out
upon
the
starlight
night
with
its
light
and
warmth
and
comfort
with
its
hospitable
jingle
at
a
distance
of
preparations
for
dinner
with
the
face
of
its
generous
master
brightening
everything
we
saw
and
just
wind
enough
without
to
sound
a
low
accompaniment
to
everything
we
heard
were
our
first
impressions
of
bleak
house
i
am
glad
you
like
it
said
jarndyce
when
he
had
brought
us
round
again
to
ada
it
makes
no
pretensions
but
it
is
a
comfortable
little
place
i
hope
and
will
be
more
so
with
such
bright
young
looks
in
it
you
have
barely
half
an
hour
before
dinner
there
no
one
here
but
the
finest
creature
upon
earth
a
child
more
children
esther
said
ada
i
do
mean
literally
a
child
pursued
jarndyce
not
a
child
in
years
he
is
grown
up
he
is
at
least
as
old
as
i
am
but
in
simplicity
and
freshness
and
enthusiasm
and
a
fine
guileless
inaptitude
for
all
worldly
affairs
he
is
a
perfect
child
we
felt
that
he
must
be
very
interesting
he
knows
jellyby
said
jarndyce
he
is
a
musical
man
an
amateur
but
might
have
been
a
professional
he
is
an
artist
too
an
amateur
but
might
have
been
a
professional
he
is
a
man
of
attainments
and
of
captivating
manners
he
has
been
unfortunate
in
his
affairs
and
unfortunate
in
his
pursuits
and
unfortunate
in
his
family
but
he
do
care
he
a
child
did
you
imply
that
he
has
children
of
his
own
sir
inquired
richard
yes
rick
more
nearer
a
dozen
i
should
think
but
he
has
never
looked
after
them
how
could
he
he
wanted
somebody
to
look
after
him
he
is
a
child
you
know
said
jarndyce
and
have
the
children
looked
after
themselves
at
all
sir
inquired
richard
why
just
as
you
may
suppose
said
jarndyce
his
countenance
suddenly
falling
it
is
said
that
the
children
of
the
very
poor
are
not
brought
up
but
dragged
up
harold
skimpole
children
have
tumbled
up
somehow
or
other
the
wind
getting
round
again
i
am
afraid
i
feel
it
rather
richard
observed
that
the
situation
was
exposed
on
a
sharp
night
it
is
exposed
said
jarndyce
no
doubt
that
the
cause
bleak
house
has
an
exposed
sound
but
you
are
coming
my
way
come
along
our
luggage
having
arrived
and
being
all
at
hand
i
was
dressed
in
a
few
minutes
and
engaged
in
putting
my
worldly
goods
away
when
a
maid
not
the
one
in
attendance
upon
ada
but
another
whom
i
had
not
seen
brought
a
basket
into
my
room
with
two
bunches
of
keys
in
it
all
labelled
for
you
miss
if
you
please
said
she
for
me
said
i
the
housekeeping
keys
miss
i
showed
my
surprise
for
she
added
with
some
little
surprise
on
her
own
part
i
was
told
to
bring
them
as
soon
as
you
was
alone
miss
miss
summerson
if
i
do
deceive
myself
yes
said
i
that
is
my
name
the
large
bunch
is
the
housekeeping
and
the
little
bunch
is
the
cellars
miss
any
time
you
was
pleased
to
appoint
morning
i
was
to
show
you
the
presses
and
things
they
belong
to
i
said
i
would
be
ready
at
six
and
after
she
was
gone
stood
looking
at
the
basket
quite
lost
in
the
magnitude
of
my
trust
ada
found
me
thus
and
had
such
a
delightful
confidence
in
me
when
i
showed
her
the
keys
and
told
her
about
them
that
it
would
have
been
insensibility
and
ingratitude
not
to
feel
encouraged
i
knew
to
be
sure
that
it
was
the
dear
girl
kindness
but
i
liked
to
be
so
pleasantly
cheated
when
we
went
downstairs
we
were
presented
to
skimpole
who
was
standing
before
the
fire
telling
richard
how
fond
he
used
to
be
in
his
of
football
he
was
a
little
bright
creature
with
a
rather
large
head
but
a
delicate
face
and
a
sweet
voice
and
there
was
a
perfect
charm
in
him
all
he
said
was
so
free
from
effort
and
spontaneous
and
was
said
with
such
a
captivating
gaiety
that
it
was
fascinating
to
hear
him
talk
being
of
a
more
slender
figure
than
jarndyce
and
having
a
richer
complexion
with
browner
hair
he
looked
younger
indeed
he
had
more
the
appearance
in
all
respects
of
a
damaged
young
man
than
a
elderly
one
there
was
an
easy
negligence
in
his
manner
and
even
in
his
dress
his
hair
carelessly
disposed
and
his
loose
and
flowing
as
i
have
seen
artists
paint
their
own
portraits
which
i
could
not
separate
from
the
idea
of
a
romantic
youth
who
had
undergone
some
unique
process
of
depreciation
it
struck
me
as
being
not
at
all
like
the
manner
or
appearance
of
a
man
who
had
advanced
in
life
by
the
usual
road
of
years
cares
and
experiences
i
gathered
from
the
conversation
that
skimpole
had
been
educated
for
the
medical
profession
and
had
once
lived
in
his
professional
capacity
in
the
household
of
a
german
prince
he
told
us
however
that
as
he
had
always
been
a
mere
child
in
point
of
weights
and
measures
and
had
never
known
anything
about
them
except
that
they
disgusted
him
he
had
never
been
able
to
prescribe
with
the
requisite
accuracy
of
detail
in
fact
he
said
he
had
no
head
for
detail
and
he
told
us
with
great
humour
that
when
he
was
wanted
to
bleed
the
prince
or
physic
any
of
his
people
he
was
generally
found
lying
on
his
back
in
bed
reading
the
newspapers
or
making
in
pencil
and
could
come
the
prince
at
last
objecting
to
this
in
which
said
skimpole
in
the
frankest
manner
he
was
perfectly
right
the
engagement
terminated
and
skimpole
having
as
he
added
with
delightful
gaiety
nothing
to
live
upon
but
love
fell
in
love
and
married
and
surrounded
himself
with
rosy
cheeks
his
good
friend
jarndyce
and
some
other
of
his
good
friends
then
helped
him
in
quicker
or
slower
succession
to
several
openings
in
life
but
to
no
purpose
for
he
must
confess
to
two
of
the
oldest
infirmities
in
the
world
one
was
that
he
had
no
idea
of
time
the
other
that
he
had
no
idea
of
money
in
consequence
of
which
he
never
kept
an
appointment
never
could
transact
any
business
and
never
knew
the
value
of
anything
well
so
he
had
got
on
in
life
and
here
he
was
he
was
very
fond
of
reading
the
papers
very
fond
of
making
with
a
pencil
very
fond
of
nature
very
fond
of
art
all
he
asked
of
society
was
to
let
him
live
that
much
his
wants
were
few
give
him
the
papers
conversation
music
mutton
coffee
landscape
fruit
in
the
season
a
few
sheets
of
and
a
little
claret
and
he
asked
no
more
he
was
a
mere
child
in
the
world
but
he
did
cry
for
the
moon
he
said
to
the
world
go
your
several
ways
in
peace
wear
red
coats
blue
coats
lawn
sleeves
put
pens
behind
your
ears
wear
aprons
go
after
glory
holiness
commerce
trade
any
object
you
prefer
only
let
harold
skimpole
live
all
this
and
a
great
deal
more
he
told
us
not
only
with
the
utmost
brilliancy
and
enjoyment
but
with
a
certain
vivacious
candour
speaking
of
himself
as
if
he
were
not
at
all
his
own
affair
as
if
skimpole
were
a
third
person
as
if
he
knew
that
skimpole
had
his
singularities
but
still
had
his
claims
too
which
were
the
general
business
of
the
community
and
must
not
be
slighted
he
was
quite
enchanting
if
i
felt
at
all
confused
at
that
early
time
in
endeavouring
to
reconcile
anything
he
said
with
anything
i
had
thought
about
the
duties
and
accountabilities
of
life
which
i
am
far
from
sure
of
i
was
confused
by
not
exactly
understanding
why
he
was
free
of
them
that
he
was
free
of
them
i
scarcely
doubted
he
was
so
very
clear
about
it
himself
i
covet
nothing
said
skimpole
in
the
same
light
way
possession
is
nothing
to
me
here
is
my
friend
jarndyce
excellent
house
i
feel
obliged
to
him
for
possessing
it
i
can
sketch
it
and
alter
it
i
can
set
it
to
music
when
i
am
here
i
have
sufficient
possession
of
it
and
have
neither
trouble
cost
nor
responsibility
my
steward
name
in
short
is
jarndyce
and
he
ca
cheat
me
we
have
been
mentioning
jellyby
there
is
a
woman
of
a
strong
will
and
immense
power
of
business
detail
who
throws
herself
into
objects
with
surprising
ardour
i
do
regret
that
i
have
not
a
strong
will
and
an
immense
power
of
business
detail
to
throw
myself
into
objects
with
surprising
ardour
i
can
admire
her
without
envy
i
can
sympathize
with
the
objects
i
can
dream
of
them
i
can
lie
down
on
the
grass
in
fine
weather
and
float
along
an
african
river
embracing
all
the
natives
i
meet
as
sensible
of
the
deep
silence
and
sketching
the
dense
overhanging
tropical
growth
as
accurately
as
if
i
were
there
i
do
know
that
it
of
any
direct
use
my
doing
so
but
it
all
i
can
do
and
i
do
it
thoroughly
then
for
heaven
sake
having
harold
skimpole
a
confiding
child
petitioning
you
the
world
an
agglomeration
of
practical
people
of
business
habits
to
let
him
live
and
admire
the
human
family
do
it
somehow
or
other
like
good
souls
and
suffer
him
to
ride
his
it
was
plain
enough
that
jarndyce
had
not
been
neglectful
of
the
adjuration
skimpole
general
position
there
would
have
rendered
it
so
without
the
addition
of
what
he
presently
said
it
only
you
the
generous
creatures
whom
i
envy
said
skimpole
addressing
us
his
new
friends
in
an
impersonal
manner
i
envy
you
your
power
of
doing
what
you
do
it
is
what
i
should
revel
in
myself
i
do
feel
any
vulgar
gratitude
to
you
i
almost
feel
as
if
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
giving
you
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
the
luxury
of
generosity
i
know
you
like
it
for
anything
i
can
tell
i
may
have
come
into
the
world
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
your
stock
of
happiness
i
may
have
been
born
to
be
a
benefactor
to
you
by
sometimes
giving
you
an
opportunity
of
assisting
me
in
my
little
perplexities
why
should
i
regret
my
incapacity
for
details
and
worldly
affairs
when
it
leads
to
such
pleasant
consequences
i
do
regret
it
therefore
of
all
his
playful
speeches
playful
yet
always
fully
meaning
what
they
expressed
none
seemed
to
be
more
to
the
taste
of
jarndyce
than
this
i
had
often
new
temptations
afterwards
to
wonder
whether
it
was
really
singular
or
only
singular
to
me
that
he
who
was
probably
the
most
grateful
of
mankind
upon
the
least
occasion
should
so
desire
to
escape
the
gratitude
of
others
we
were
all
enchanted
i
felt
it
a
merited
tribute
to
the
engaging
qualities
of
ada
and
richard
that
skimpole
seeing
them
for
the
first
time
should
be
so
unreserved
and
should
lay
himself
out
to
be
so
exquisitely
agreeable
they
and
especially
richard
were
naturally
pleased
for
similar
reasons
and
considered
it
no
common
privilege
to
be
so
freely
confided
in
by
such
an
attractive
man
the
more
we
listened
the
more
gaily
skimpole
talked
and
what
with
his
fine
hilarious
manner
and
his
engaging
candour
and
his
genial
way
of
lightly
tossing
his
own
weaknesses
about
as
if
he
had
said
i
am
a
child
you
know
you
are
designing
people
compared
with
me
he
really
made
me
consider
myself
in
that
light
but
i
am
gay
and
innocent
forget
your
worldly
arts
and
play
with
me
the
effect
was
absolutely
dazzling
he
was
so
full
of
feeling
too
and
had
such
a
delicate
sentiment
for
what
was
beautiful
or
tender
that
he
could
have
won
a
heart
by
that
alone
in
the
evening
when
i
was
preparing
to
make
tea
and
ada
was
touching
the
piano
in
the
adjoining
room
and
softly
humming
a
tune
to
her
cousin
richard
which
they
had
happened
to
mention
he
came
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
near
me
and
so
spoke
of
ada
that
i
almost
loved
him
she
is
like
the
morning
he
said
with
that
golden
hair
those
blue
eyes
and
that
fresh
bloom
on
her
cheek
she
is
like
the
summer
morning
the
birds
here
will
mistake
her
for
it
we
will
not
call
such
a
lovely
young
creature
as
that
who
is
a
joy
to
all
mankind
an
orphan
she
is
the
child
of
the
universe
jarndyce
i
found
was
standing
near
us
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
an
attentive
smile
upon
his
face
the
universe
he
observed
makes
rather
an
indifferent
parent
i
am
afraid
oh
i
do
know
cried
skimpole
buoyantly
i
think
i
do
know
said
jarndyce
well
cried
skimpole
you
know
the
world
which
in
your
sense
is
the
universe
and
i
know
nothing
of
it
so
you
shall
have
your
way
but
if
i
had
mine
glancing
at
the
cousins
there
should
be
no
brambles
of
sordid
realities
in
such
a
path
as
that
it
should
be
strewn
with
roses
it
should
lie
through
bowers
where
there
was
no
spring
autumn
nor
winter
but
perpetual
summer
age
or
change
should
never
wither
it
the
base
word
money
should
never
be
breathed
near
it
jarndyce
patted
him
on
the
head
with
a
smile
as
if
he
had
been
really
a
child
and
passing
a
step
or
two
on
and
stopping
a
moment
glanced
at
the
young
cousins
his
look
was
thoughtful
but
had
a
benignant
expression
in
it
which
i
often
how
often
saw
again
which
has
long
been
engraven
on
my
heart
the
room
in
which
they
were
communicating
with
that
in
which
he
stood
was
only
lighted
by
the
fire
ada
sat
at
the
piano
richard
stood
beside
her
bending
down
upon
the
wall
their
shadows
blended
together
surrounded
by
strange
forms
not
without
a
ghostly
motion
caught
from
the
unsteady
fire
though
reflecting
from
motionless
objects
ada
touched
the
notes
so
softly
and
sang
so
low
that
the
wind
sighing
away
to
the
distant
hills
was
as
audible
as
the
music
the
mystery
of
the
future
and
the
little
clue
afforded
to
it
by
the
voice
of
the
present
seemed
expressed
in
the
whole
picture
but
it
is
not
to
recall
this
fancy
well
as
i
remember
it
that
i
recall
the
scene
first
i
was
not
quite
unconscious
of
the
contrast
in
respect
of
meaning
and
intention
between
the
silent
look
directed
that
way
and
the
flow
of
words
that
had
preceded
it
secondly
though
jarndyce
glance
as
he
withdrew
it
rested
for
but
a
moment
on
me
i
felt
as
if
in
that
moment
he
confided
to
me
and
knew
that
he
confided
to
me
and
that
i
received
the
confidence
his
hope
that
ada
and
richard
might
one
day
enter
on
a
dearer
relationship
skimpole
could
play
on
the
piano
and
the
violoncello
and
he
was
a
composer
had
composed
half
an
opera
once
but
got
tired
of
it
and
played
what
he
composed
with
taste
after
tea
we
had
quite
a
little
concert
in
which
richard
who
was
enthralled
by
ada
singing
and
told
me
that
she
seemed
to
know
all
the
songs
that
ever
were
written
and
jarndyce
and
i
were
the
audience
after
a
little
while
i
missed
first
skimpole
and
afterwards
richard
and
while
i
was
thinking
how
could
richard
stay
away
so
long
and
lose
so
much
the
maid
who
had
given
me
the
keys
looked
in
at
the
door
saying
if
you
please
miss
could
you
spare
a
minute
when
i
was
shut
out
with
her
in
the
hall
she
said
holding
up
her
hands
oh
if
you
please
miss
carstone
says
would
you
come
upstairs
to
skimpole
room
he
has
been
took
miss
took
said
i
took
miss
sudden
said
the
maid
i
was
apprehensive
that
his
illness
might
be
of
a
dangerous
kind
but
of
course
i
begged
her
to
be
quiet
and
not
disturb
any
one
and
collected
myself
as
i
followed
her
quickly
upstairs
sufficiently
to
consider
what
were
the
best
remedies
to
be
applied
if
it
should
prove
to
be
a
fit
she
threw
open
a
door
and
i
went
into
a
chamber
where
to
my
unspeakable
surprise
instead
of
finding
skimpole
stretched
upon
the
bed
or
prostrate
on
the
floor
i
found
him
standing
before
the
fire
smiling
at
richard
while
richard
with
a
face
of
great
embarrassment
looked
at
a
person
on
the
sofa
in
a
white
with
smooth
hair
upon
his
head
and
not
much
of
it
which
he
was
wiping
smoother
and
making
less
of
with
a
miss
summerson
said
richard
hurriedly
i
am
glad
you
are
come
you
will
be
able
to
advise
us
our
friend
skimpole
do
be
alarmed
is
arrested
for
debt
and
really
my
dear
miss
summerson
said
skimpole
with
his
agreeable
candour
i
never
was
in
a
situation
in
which
that
excellent
sense
and
quiet
habit
of
method
and
usefulness
which
anybody
must
observe
in
you
who
has
the
happiness
of
being
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
your
society
was
more
needed
the
person
on
the
sofa
who
appeared
to
have
a
cold
in
his
head
gave
such
a
very
loud
snort
that
he
startled
me
are
you
arrested
for
much
sir
i
inquired
of
skimpole
my
dear
miss
summerson
said
he
shaking
his
head
pleasantly
i
do
know
some
pounds
odd
shillings
and
halfpence
i
think
were
mentioned
it
pound
sixteen
and
sevenpence
observed
the
stranger
that
wot
it
is
and
it
sounds
somehow
it
sounds
said
skimpole
like
a
small
sum
the
strange
man
said
nothing
but
made
another
snort
it
was
such
a
powerful
one
that
it
seemed
quite
to
lift
him
out
of
his
seat
skimpole
said
richard
to
me
has
a
delicacy
in
applying
to
my
cousin
jarndyce
because
he
has
lately
i
think
sir
i
understood
you
that
you
had
lately
oh
yes
returned
skimpole
smiling
though
i
forgot
how
much
it
was
and
when
it
was
jarndyce
would
readily
do
it
again
but
i
have
the
feeling
that
i
would
prefer
a
novelty
in
help
that
i
would
rather
and
he
looked
at
richard
and
me
develop
generosity
in
a
new
soil
and
in
a
new
form
of
flower
what
do
you
think
will
be
best
miss
summerson
said
richard
aside
i
ventured
to
inquire
generally
before
replying
what
would
happen
if
the
money
were
not
produced
jail
said
the
strange
man
coolly
putting
his
handkerchief
into
his
hat
which
was
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
or
coavinses
may
i
ask
sir
what
is
coavinses
said
the
strange
man
a
richard
and
i
looked
at
one
another
again
it
was
a
most
singular
thing
that
the
arrest
was
our
embarrassment
and
not
skimpole
he
observed
us
with
a
genial
interest
but
there
seemed
if
i
may
venture
on
such
a
contradiction
nothing
selfish
in
it
he
had
entirely
washed
his
hands
of
the
difficulty
and
it
had
become
ours
i
thought
he
suggested
as
if
to
help
us
out
that
being
parties
in
a
chancery
suit
concerning
as
people
say
a
large
amount
of
property
richard
or
his
beautiful
cousin
or
both
could
sign
something
or
make
over
something
or
give
some
sort
of
undertaking
or
pledge
or
bond
i
do
know
what
the
business
name
of
it
may
be
but
i
suppose
there
is
some
instrument
within
their
power
that
would
settle
this
not
a
bit
on
it
said
the
strange
man
really
returned
skimpole
that
seems
odd
now
to
one
who
is
no
judge
of
these
things
odd
or
even
said
the
stranger
gruffly
i
tell
you
not
a
bit
on
it
keep
your
temper
my
good
fellow
keep
your
temper
skimpole
gently
reasoned
with
him
as
he
made
a
little
drawing
of
his
head
on
the
of
a
book
do
be
ruffled
by
your
occupation
we
can
separate
you
from
your
office
we
can
separate
the
individual
from
the
pursuit
we
are
not
so
prejudiced
as
to
suppose
that
in
private
life
you
are
otherwise
than
a
very
estimable
man
with
a
great
deal
of
poetry
in
your
nature
of
which
you
may
not
be
conscious
the
stranger
only
answered
with
another
violent
snort
whether
in
acceptance
of
the
or
in
disdainful
rejection
of
it
he
did
not
express
to
me
now
my
dear
miss
summerson
and
my
dear
richard
said
skimpole
gaily
innocently
and
confidingly
as
he
looked
at
his
drawing
with
his
head
on
one
side
here
you
see
me
utterly
incapable
of
helping
myself
and
entirely
in
your
hands
i
only
ask
to
be
free
the
butterflies
are
free
mankind
will
surely
not
deny
to
harold
skimpole
what
it
concedes
to
the
butterflies
my
dear
miss
summerson
said
richard
in
a
whisper
i
have
ten
pounds
that
i
received
from
kenge
i
must
try
what
that
will
do
i
possessed
fifteen
pounds
odd
shillings
which
i
had
saved
from
my
quarterly
allowance
during
several
years
i
had
always
thought
that
some
accident
might
happen
which
would
throw
me
suddenly
without
any
relation
or
any
property
on
the
world
and
had
always
tried
to
keep
some
little
money
by
me
that
i
might
not
be
quite
penniless
i
told
richard
of
my
having
this
little
store
and
having
no
present
need
of
it
and
i
asked
him
delicately
to
inform
skimpole
while
i
should
be
gone
to
fetch
it
that
we
would
have
the
pleasure
of
paying
his
debt
when
i
came
back
skimpole
kissed
my
hand
and
seemed
quite
touched
not
on
his
own
account
i
was
again
aware
of
that
perplexing
and
extraordinary
contradiction
but
on
ours
as
if
personal
considerations
were
impossible
with
him
and
the
contemplation
of
our
happiness
alone
affected
him
richard
begging
me
for
the
greater
grace
of
the
transaction
as
he
said
to
settle
with
coavinses
as
skimpole
now
jocularly
called
him
i
counted
out
the
money
and
received
the
necessary
acknowledgment
this
too
delighted
skimpole
his
compliments
were
so
delicately
administered
that
i
blushed
less
than
i
might
have
done
and
settled
with
the
stranger
in
the
white
coat
without
making
any
mistakes
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
shortly
said
well
then
i
wish
you
a
good
evening
miss
my
friend
said
skimpole
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
after
giving
up
the
sketch
when
it
was
half
finished
i
should
like
to
ask
you
something
without
offence
i
think
the
reply
was
cut
away
then
did
you
know
this
morning
now
that
you
were
coming
out
on
this
errand
said
skimpole
know
it
at
said
coavinses
it
did
affect
your
appetite
did
make
you
at
all
uneasy
not
a
bit
said
coavinses
i
know
if
you
wos
missed
you
would
be
missed
a
day
makes
no
such
odds
but
when
you
came
down
here
proceeded
skimpole
it
was
a
fine
day
the
sun
was
shining
the
wind
was
blowing
the
lights
and
shadows
were
passing
across
the
fields
the
birds
were
singing
nobody
said
they
war
in
my
hearing
returned
coavinses
no
observed
skimpole
but
what
did
you
think
upon
the
road
wot
do
you
mean
growled
coavinses
with
an
appearance
of
strong
resentment
think
i
got
enough
to
do
and
little
enough
to
get
for
it
without
thinking
thinking
with
profound
contempt
then
you
did
think
at
all
events
proceeded
skimpole
to
this
effect
skimpole
loves
to
see
the
sun
shine
loves
to
hear
the
wind
blow
loves
to
watch
the
changing
lights
and
shadows
loves
to
hear
the
birds
those
choristers
in
nature
great
cathedral
and
does
it
seem
to
me
that
i
am
about
to
deprive
harold
skimpole
of
his
share
in
such
possessions
which
are
his
only
birthright
you
thought
nothing
to
that
effect
i
certainly
did
not
said
coavinses
whose
doggedness
in
utterly
renouncing
the
idea
was
of
that
intense
kind
that
he
could
only
give
adequate
expression
to
it
by
putting
a
long
interval
between
each
word
and
accompanying
the
last
with
a
jerk
that
might
have
dislocated
his
neck
very
odd
and
very
curious
the
mental
process
is
in
you
men
of
business
said
skimpole
thoughtfully
thank
you
my
friend
good
night
as
our
absence
had
been
long
enough
already
to
seem
strange
downstairs
i
returned
at
once
and
found
ada
sitting
at
work
by
the
fireside
talking
to
her
cousin
john
skimpole
presently
appeared
and
richard
shortly
after
him
i
was
sufficiently
engaged
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
in
taking
my
first
lesson
in
backgammon
from
jarndyce
who
was
very
fond
of
the
game
and
from
whom
i
wished
of
course
to
learn
it
as
quickly
as
i
could
in
order
that
i
might
be
of
the
very
small
use
of
being
able
to
play
when
he
had
no
better
adversary
but
i
thought
occasionally
when
skimpole
played
some
fragments
of
his
own
compositions
or
when
both
at
the
piano
and
the
violoncello
and
at
our
table
he
preserved
with
an
absence
of
all
effort
his
delightful
spirits
and
his
easy
flow
of
conversation
that
richard
and
i
seemed
to
retain
the
transferred
impression
of
having
been
arrested
since
dinner
and
that
it
was
very
curious
altogether
it
was
late
before
we
separated
for
when
ada
was
going
at
eleven
skimpole
went
to
the
piano
and
rattled
hilariously
that
the
best
of
all
ways
to
lengthen
our
days
was
to
steal
a
few
hours
from
night
my
dear
it
was
past
twelve
before
he
took
his
candle
and
his
radiant
face
out
of
the
room
and
i
think
he
might
have
kept
us
there
if
he
had
seen
fit
until
daybreak
ada
and
richard
were
lingering
for
a
few
moments
by
the
fire
wondering
whether
jellyby
had
yet
finished
her
dictation
for
the
day
when
jarndyce
who
had
been
out
of
the
room
returned
oh
dear
me
what
this
what
this
he
said
rubbing
his
head
and
walking
about
with
his
vexation
what
this
they
tell
me
rick
my
boy
esther
my
dear
what
have
you
been
doing
why
did
you
do
it
how
could
you
do
it
how
much
apiece
was
it
the
wind
round
again
i
feel
it
all
over
me
we
neither
of
us
quite
knew
what
to
answer
come
rick
come
i
must
settle
this
before
i
sleep
how
much
are
you
out
of
pocket
you
two
made
the
money
up
you
know
why
did
you
how
could
you
oh
lord
yes
it
due
east
must
be
really
sir
said
richard
i
do
think
it
would
be
honourable
in
me
to
tell
you
skimpole
relied
upon
us
lord
bless
you
my
dear
boy
he
relies
upon
everybody
said
jarndyce
giving
his
head
a
great
rub
and
stopping
short
indeed
sir
everybody
and
he
be
in
the
same
scrape
again
next
week
said
jarndyce
walking
again
at
a
great
pace
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
that
had
gone
out
he
always
in
the
same
scrape
he
was
born
in
the
same
scrape
i
verily
believe
that
the
announcement
in
the
newspapers
when
his
mother
was
confined
was
tuesday
last
at
her
residence
in
botheration
buildings
skimpole
of
a
son
in
difficulties
richard
laughed
heartily
but
added
still
sir
i
do
want
to
shake
his
confidence
or
to
break
his
confidence
and
if
i
submit
to
your
better
knowledge
again
that
i
ought
to
keep
his
secret
i
hope
you
will
consider
before
you
press
me
any
more
of
course
if
you
do
press
me
sir
i
shall
know
i
am
wrong
and
will
tell
you
well
cried
jarndyce
stopping
again
and
making
several
absent
endeavours
to
put
his
candlestick
in
his
pocket
i
here
take
it
away
my
dear
i
do
know
what
i
am
about
with
it
it
all
the
wind
invariably
has
that
effect
i
wo
press
you
rick
you
may
be
right
but
really
to
get
hold
of
you
and
esther
and
to
squeeze
you
like
a
couple
of
tender
young
saint
michael
oranges
it
blow
a
gale
in
the
course
of
the
night
he
was
now
alternately
putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
as
if
he
were
going
to
keep
them
there
a
long
time
and
taking
them
out
again
and
vehemently
rubbing
them
all
over
his
head
i
ventured
to
take
this
opportunity
of
hinting
that
skimpole
being
in
all
such
matters
quite
a
child
eh
my
dear
said
jarndyce
catching
at
the
word
being
quite
a
child
sir
said
i
and
so
different
from
other
people
you
are
right
said
jarndyce
brightening
your
woman
wit
hits
the
mark
he
is
a
child
an
absolute
child
i
told
you
he
was
a
child
you
know
when
i
first
mentioned
him
certainly
certainly
we
said
and
he
is
a
child
now
is
he
asked
jarndyce
brightening
more
and
more
he
was
indeed
we
said
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
the
height
of
childishness
in
you
i
mean
me
said
jarndyce
to
regard
him
for
a
moment
as
a
man
you
ca
make
him
responsible
the
idea
of
harold
skimpole
with
designs
or
plans
or
knowledge
of
consequences
ha
ha
ha
it
was
so
delicious
to
see
the
clouds
about
his
bright
face
clearing
and
to
see
him
so
heartily
pleased
and
to
know
as
it
was
impossible
not
to
know
that
the
source
of
his
pleasure
was
the
goodness
which
was
tortured
by
condemning
or
mistrusting
or
secretly
accusing
any
one
that
i
saw
the
tears
in
ada
eyes
while
she
echoed
his
laugh
and
felt
them
in
my
own
why
what
a
cod
head
and
shoulders
i
am
said
jarndyce
to
require
reminding
of
it
the
whole
business
shows
the
child
from
beginning
to
end
nobody
but
a
child
would
have
thought
of
singling
you
two
out
for
parties
in
the
affair
nobody
but
a
child
would
have
thought
of
your
having
the
money
if
it
had
been
a
thousand
pounds
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
said
jarndyce
with
his
whole
face
in
a
glow
we
all
confirmed
it
from
our
night
experience
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
said
jarndyce
however
rick
esther
and
you
too
ada
for
i
do
know
that
even
your
little
purse
is
safe
from
his
inexperience
i
must
have
a
promise
all
round
that
nothing
of
this
sort
shall
ever
be
done
any
more
no
advances
not
even
sixpences
we
all
promised
faithfully
richard
with
a
merry
glance
at
me
touching
his
pocket
as
if
to
remind
me
that
there
was
no
danger
of
our
transgressing
as
to
skimpole
said
jarndyce
a
habitable
doll
house
with
good
board
and
a
few
tin
people
to
get
into
debt
with
and
borrow
money
of
would
set
the
boy
up
in
life
he
is
in
a
child
sleep
by
this
time
i
suppose
it
time
i
should
take
my
craftier
head
to
my
more
worldly
pillow
good
night
my
dears
god
bless
you
he
peeped
in
again
with
a
smiling
face
before
we
had
lighted
our
candles
and
said
oh
i
have
been
looking
at
the
i
find
it
was
a
false
alarm
about
the
wind
it
in
the
south
and
went
away
singing
to
himself
ada
and
i
agreed
as
we
talked
together
for
a
little
while
upstairs
that
this
caprice
about
the
wind
was
a
fiction
and
that
he
used
the
pretence
to
account
for
any
disappointment
he
could
not
conceal
rather
than
he
would
blame
the
real
cause
of
it
or
disparage
or
depreciate
any
one
we
thought
this
very
characteristic
of
his
eccentric
gentleness
and
of
the
difference
between
him
and
those
petulant
people
who
make
the
weather
and
the
winds
particularly
that
unlucky
wind
which
he
had
chosen
for
such
a
different
purpose
the
of
their
splenetic
and
gloomy
humours
indeed
so
much
affection
for
him
had
been
added
in
this
one
evening
to
my
gratitude
that
i
hoped
i
already
began
to
understand
him
through
that
mingled
feeling
any
seeming
inconsistencies
in
skimpole
or
in
jellyby
i
could
not
expect
to
be
able
to
reconcile
having
so
little
experience
or
practical
knowledge
neither
did
i
try
for
my
thoughts
were
busy
when
i
was
alone
with
ada
and
richard
and
with
the
confidence
i
had
seemed
to
receive
concerning
them
my
fancy
made
a
little
wild
by
the
wind
perhaps
would
not
consent
to
be
all
unselfish
either
though
i
would
have
persuaded
it
to
be
so
if
i
could
it
wandered
back
to
my
house
and
came
along
the
intervening
track
raising
up
shadowy
speculations
which
had
sometimes
trembled
there
in
the
dark
as
to
what
knowledge
jarndyce
had
of
my
earliest
history
even
as
to
the
possibility
of
his
being
my
father
though
that
idle
dream
was
quite
gone
now
it
was
all
gone
now
i
remembered
getting
up
from
the
fire
it
was
not
for
me
to
muse
over
bygones
but
to
act
with
a
cheerful
spirit
and
a
grateful
heart
so
i
said
to
myself
esther
esther
esther
duty
my
dear
and
gave
my
little
basket
of
housekeeping
keys
such
a
shake
that
they
sounded
like
little
bells
and
rang
me
hopefully
to
bed
chapter
vii
the
ghost
walk
while
esther
sleeps
and
while
esther
wakes
it
is
still
wet
weather
down
at
the
place
in
lincolnshire
the
rain
is
ever
falling
drip
drip
drip
by
day
and
night
upon
the
broad
flagged
the
ghost
walk
the
weather
is
so
very
bad
down
in
lincolnshire
that
the
liveliest
imagination
can
scarcely
apprehend
its
ever
being
fine
again
not
that
there
is
any
superabundant
life
of
imagination
on
the
spot
for
sir
leicester
is
not
here
and
truly
even
if
he
were
would
not
do
much
for
it
in
that
particular
but
is
in
paris
with
my
lady
and
solitude
with
dusky
wings
sits
brooding
upon
chesney
wold
there
may
be
some
motions
of
fancy
among
the
lower
animals
at
chesney
wold
the
horses
in
the
stables
the
long
stables
in
a
barren
where
there
is
a
great
bell
in
a
turret
and
a
clock
with
a
large
face
which
the
pigeons
who
live
near
it
and
who
love
to
perch
upon
its
shoulders
seem
to
be
always
consulting
they
may
contemplate
some
mental
pictures
of
fine
weather
on
occasions
and
may
be
better
artists
at
them
than
the
grooms
the
old
roan
so
famous
for
work
turning
his
large
eyeball
to
the
grated
window
near
his
rack
may
remember
the
fresh
leaves
that
glisten
there
at
other
times
and
the
scents
that
stream
in
and
may
have
a
fine
run
with
the
hounds
while
the
human
helper
clearing
out
the
next
stall
never
stirs
beyond
his
pitchfork
and
the
grey
whose
place
is
opposite
the
door
and
who
with
an
impatient
rattle
of
his
halter
pricks
his
ears
and
turns
his
head
so
wistfully
when
it
is
opened
and
to
whom
the
opener
says
woa
grey
then
steady
noabody
wants
you
may
know
it
quite
as
well
as
the
man
the
whole
seemingly
monotonous
and
uncompanionable
stabled
together
may
pass
the
long
wet
hours
when
the
door
is
shut
in
livelier
communication
than
is
held
in
the
servants
hall
or
at
the
dedlock
arms
or
may
even
beguile
the
time
by
improving
perhaps
corrupting
the
pony
in
the
in
the
corner
so
the
mastiff
dozing
in
his
kennel
in
the
with
his
large
head
on
his
paws
may
think
of
the
hot
sunshine
when
the
shadows
of
the
tire
his
patience
out
by
changing
and
leave
him
at
one
time
of
the
day
no
broader
refuge
than
the
shadow
of
his
own
house
where
he
sits
on
end
panting
and
growling
short
and
very
much
wanting
something
to
worry
besides
himself
and
his
chain
so
now
and
he
may
recall
the
house
full
of
company
the
full
of
vehicles
the
stables
full
of
horses
and
the
full
of
attendants
upon
horses
until
he
is
undecided
about
the
present
and
comes
forth
to
see
how
it
is
then
with
that
impatient
shake
of
himself
he
may
growl
in
the
spirit
rain
rain
rain
nothing
but
rain
and
no
family
here
as
he
goes
in
again
and
lies
down
with
a
gloomy
yawn
so
with
the
dogs
in
the
across
the
park
who
have
their
restless
fits
and
whose
doleful
voices
when
the
wind
has
been
very
obstinate
have
even
made
it
known
in
the
house
itself
upstairs
downstairs
and
in
my
lady
chamber
they
may
hunt
the
whole
while
the
raindrops
are
pattering
round
their
inactivity
so
the
rabbits
with
their
tails
frisking
in
and
out
of
holes
at
roots
of
trees
may
be
lively
with
ideas
of
the
breezy
days
when
their
ears
are
blown
about
or
of
those
seasons
of
interest
when
there
are
sweet
young
plants
to
gnaw
the
turkey
in
the
always
troubled
with
a
probably
christmas
may
be
reminiscent
of
that
summer
morning
wrongfully
taken
from
him
when
he
got
into
the
lane
among
the
felled
trees
where
there
was
a
barn
and
barley
the
discontented
goose
who
stoops
to
pass
under
the
old
gateway
twenty
feet
high
may
gabble
out
if
we
only
knew
it
a
waddling
preference
for
weather
when
the
gateway
casts
its
shadow
on
the
ground
be
this
as
it
may
there
is
not
much
fancy
otherwise
stirring
at
chesney
wold
if
there
be
a
little
at
any
odd
moment
it
goes
like
a
little
noise
in
that
old
echoing
place
a
long
way
and
usually
leads
off
to
ghosts
and
mystery
it
has
rained
so
hard
and
rained
so
long
down
in
lincolnshire
that
rouncewell
the
old
housekeeper
at
chesney
wold
has
several
times
taken
off
her
spectacles
and
cleaned
them
to
make
certain
that
the
drops
were
not
upon
the
glasses
rouncewell
might
have
been
sufficiently
assured
by
hearing
the
rain
but
that
she
is
rather
deaf
which
nothing
will
induce
her
to
believe
she
is
a
fine
old
lady
handsome
stately
wonderfully
neat
and
has
such
a
back
and
such
a
stomacher
that
if
her
stays
should
turn
out
when
she
dies
to
have
been
a
broad
family
nobody
who
knows
her
would
have
cause
to
be
surprised
weather
affects
rouncewell
little
the
house
is
there
in
all
weathers
and
the
house
as
she
expresses
it
is
what
she
looks
at
she
sits
in
her
room
in
a
side
passage
on
the
ground
floor
with
an
arched
window
commanding
a
smooth
quadrangle
adorned
at
regular
intervals
with
smooth
round
trees
and
smooth
round
blocks
of
stone
as
if
the
trees
were
going
to
play
at
bowls
with
the
stones
and
the
whole
house
reposes
on
her
mind
she
can
open
it
on
occasion
and
be
busy
and
fluttered
but
it
is
shut
up
now
and
lies
on
the
breadth
of
bosom
in
a
majestic
sleep
it
is
the
next
difficult
thing
to
an
impossibility
to
imagine
chesney
wold
without
rouncewell
but
she
has
only
been
here
fifty
years
ask
her
how
long
this
rainy
day
and
she
shall
answer
fifty
year
three
months
and
a
fortnight
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
if
i
live
till
tuesday
rouncewell
died
some
time
before
the
decease
of
the
pretty
fashion
of
and
modestly
hid
his
own
if
he
took
it
with
him
in
a
corner
of
the
churchyard
in
the
park
near
the
mouldy
porch
he
was
born
in
the
and
so
was
his
young
widow
her
progress
in
the
family
began
in
the
time
of
the
last
sir
leicester
and
originated
in
the
the
present
representative
of
the
dedlocks
is
an
excellent
master
he
supposes
all
his
dependents
to
be
utterly
bereft
of
individual
characters
intentions
or
opinions
and
is
persuaded
that
he
was
born
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
their
having
any
if
he
were
to
make
a
discovery
to
the
contrary
he
would
be
simply
stunned
would
never
recover
himself
most
likely
except
to
gasp
and
die
but
he
is
an
excellent
master
still
holding
it
a
part
of
his
state
to
be
so
he
has
a
great
liking
for
rouncewell
he
says
she
is
a
most
respectable
creditable
woman
he
always
shakes
hands
with
her
when
he
comes
down
to
chesney
wold
and
when
he
goes
away
and
if
he
were
very
ill
or
if
he
were
knocked
down
by
accident
or
run
over
or
placed
in
any
situation
expressive
of
a
dedlock
at
a
disadvantage
he
would
say
if
he
could
speak
leave
me
and
send
rouncewell
here
feeling
his
dignity
at
such
a
pass
safer
with
her
than
with
anybody
else
rouncewell
has
known
trouble
she
has
had
two
sons
of
whom
the
younger
ran
wild
and
went
for
a
soldier
and
never
came
back
even
to
this
hour
rouncewell
calm
hands
lose
their
composure
when
she
speaks
of
him
and
unfolding
themselves
from
her
stomacher
hover
about
her
in
an
agitated
manner
as
she
says
what
a
likely
lad
what
a
fine
lad
what
a
gay
clever
lad
he
was
her
second
son
would
have
been
provided
for
at
chesney
wold
and
would
have
been
made
steward
in
due
season
but
he
took
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
to
constructing
out
of
saucepans
and
setting
birds
to
draw
their
own
water
with
the
least
possible
amount
of
labour
so
assisting
them
with
artful
contrivance
of
hydraulic
pressure
that
a
thirsty
canary
had
only
in
a
literal
sense
to
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
the
job
was
done
this
propensity
gave
rouncewell
great
uneasiness
she
felt
it
with
a
mother
anguish
to
be
a
move
in
the
wat
tyler
direction
well
knowing
that
sir
leicester
had
that
general
impression
of
an
aptitude
for
any
art
to
which
smoke
and
a
tall
chimney
might
be
considered
essential
but
the
doomed
young
rebel
otherwise
a
mild
youth
and
very
persevering
showing
no
sign
of
grace
as
he
got
older
but
on
the
contrary
constructing
a
model
of
a
she
was
fain
with
many
tears
to
mention
his
backslidings
to
the
baronet
rouncewell
said
sir
leicester
i
can
never
consent
to
argue
as
you
know
with
any
one
on
any
subject
you
had
better
get
rid
of
your
boy
you
had
better
get
him
into
some
works
the
iron
country
farther
north
is
i
suppose
the
congenial
direction
for
a
boy
with
these
tendencies
farther
north
he
went
and
farther
north
he
grew
up
and
if
sir
leicester
dedlock
ever
saw
him
when
he
came
to
chesney
wold
to
visit
his
mother
or
ever
thought
of
him
afterwards
it
is
certain
that
he
only
regarded
him
as
one
of
a
body
of
some
odd
thousand
conspirators
swarthy
and
grim
who
were
in
the
habit
of
turning
out
by
torchlight
two
or
three
nights
in
the
week
for
unlawful
purposes
nevertheless
rouncewell
son
has
in
the
course
of
nature
and
art
grown
up
and
established
himself
and
married
and
called
unto
him
rouncewell
grandson
who
being
out
of
his
apprenticeship
and
home
from
a
journey
in
far
countries
whither
he
was
sent
to
enlarge
his
knowledge
and
complete
his
preparations
for
the
venture
of
this
life
stands
leaning
against
the
this
very
day
in
rouncewell

fine
young
fellow

poor
uncle

unquiet
as
usual
on
this
reference
they
say
i
am
like
my
father
grandmother
like
him
also
my
dear
but
most
like
your
poor
uncle
george
and
your
dear
father
rouncewell
folds
her
hands
again
he
is
well
thriving
grandmother
in
every
way
i
am
thankful
rouncewell
is
fond
of
her
son
but
has
a
plaintive
feeling
towards
him
much
as
if
he
were
a
very
honourable
soldier
who
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
he
is
quite
happy
says
she
quite
i
am
thankful
so
he
has
brought
you
up
to
follow
in
his
ways
and
has
sent
you
into
foreign
countries
and
the
like
well
he
knows
best
there
may
be
a
world
beyond
chesney
wold
that
i
understand
though
i
am
not
young
either
and
i
have
seen
a
quantity
of
good
company
too
grandmother
says
the
young
man
changing
the
subject
what
a
very
pretty
girl
that
was
i
found
with
you
just
now
you
called
her
rosa
yes
child
she
is
daughter
of
a
widow
in
the
village
maids
are
so
hard
to
teach
that
i
have
put
her
about
me
young
an
apt
scholar
and
will
do
well
she
shows
the
house
already
very
pretty
she
lives
with
me
at
my
table
here
i
hope
i
have
not
driven
her
away
she
supposes
we
have
family
affairs
to
speak
about
i
dare
say
she
is
very
modest
it
is
a
fine
quality
in
a
young
woman
and
scarcer
says
rouncewell
expanding
her
stomacher
to
its
utmost
limits
than
it
formerly
was
the
young
man
inclines
his
head
in
acknowledgment
of
the
precepts
of
experience
rouncewell
listens
wheels
says
she
they
have
long
been
audible
to
the
younger
ears
of
her
companion
what
wheels
on
such
a
day
as
this
for
gracious
sake
after
a
short
interval
a
tap
at
the
door
come
in
a
shy
village
beauty
comes
in
so
fresh
in
her
rosy
and
yet
delicate
bloom
that
the
drops
of
rain
which
have
beaten
on
her
hair
look
like
the
dew
upon
a
flower
fresh
gathered
what
company
is
this
rosa
says
rouncewell
it
two
young
men
in
a
gig
who
want
to
see
the
house
yes
and
if
you
please
i
told
them
so
in
quick
reply
to
a
gesture
of
dissent
from
the
housekeeper
i
went
to
the
and
told
them
it
was
the
wrong
day
and
the
wrong
hour
but
the
young
man
who
was
driving
took
off
his
hat
in
the
wet
and
begged
me
to
bring
this
card
to
you
read
it
my
dear
watt
says
the
housekeeper
rosa
is
so
shy
as
she
gives
it
to
him
that
they
drop
it
between
them
and
almost
knock
their
foreheads
together
as
they
pick
it
up
rosa
is
shyer
than
before
guppy
is
all
the
information
the
card
yields
guppy
repeats
rouncewell
guppy
nonsense
i
never
heard
of
him
if
you
please
he
told
me
that
says
rosa
but
he
said
that
he
and
the
other
young
gentleman
came
from
london
only
last
night
by
the
mail
on
business
at
the
magistrates
meeting
ten
miles
off
this
morning
and
that
as
their
business
was
soon
over
and
they
had
heard
a
great
deal
said
of
chesney
wold
and
really
did
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
they
had
come
through
the
wet
to
see
it
they
are
lawyers
he
says
he
is
not
in
tulkinghorn
office
but
he
is
sure
he
may
make
use
of
tulkinghorn
name
if
necessary
finding
now
she
leaves
off
that
she
has
been
making
quite
a
long
speech
rosa
is
shyer
than
ever
now
tulkinghorn
is
in
a
manner
part
and
parcel
of
the
place
and
besides
is
supposed
to
have
made
rouncewell
will
the
old
lady
relaxes
consents
to
the
admission
of
the
visitors
as
a
favour
and
dismisses
rosa
the
grandson
however
being
smitten
by
a
sudden
wish
to
see
the
house
himself
proposes
to
join
the
party
the
grandmother
who
is
pleased
that
he
should
have
that
interest
accompanies
him
though
to
do
him
justice
he
is
exceedingly
unwilling
to
trouble
her
much
obliged
to
you
says
guppy
divesting
himself
of
his
wet
dreadnought
in
the
hall
us
london
lawyers
do
often
get
an
out
and
when
we
do
we
like
to
make
the
most
of
it
you
know
the
old
housekeeper
with
a
gracious
severity
of
deportment
waves
her
hand
towards
the
great
staircase
guppy
and
his
friend
follow
rosa
rouncewell
and
her
grandson
follow
them
a
young
gardener
goes
before
to
open
the
shutters
as
is
usually
the
case
with
people
who
go
over
houses
guppy
and
his
friend
are
dead
beat
before
they
have
well
begun
they
straggle
about
in
wrong
places
look
at
wrong
things
do
care
for
the
right
things
gape
when
more
rooms
are
opened
exhibit
profound
depression
of
spirits
and
are
clearly
knocked
up
in
each
successive
chamber
that
they
enter
rouncewell
who
is
as
upright
as
the
house
itself
rests
apart
in
a
or
other
such
nook
and
listens
with
stately
approval
to
rosa
exposition
her
grandson
is
so
attentive
to
it
that
rosa
is
shyer
than
ever
and
prettier
thus
they
pass
on
from
room
to
room
raising
the
pictured
dedlocks
for
a
few
brief
minutes
as
the
young
gardener
admits
the
light
and
reconsigning
them
to
their
graves
as
he
shuts
it
out
again
it
appears
to
the
afflicted
guppy
and
his
inconsolable
friend
that
there
is
no
end
to
the
dedlocks
whose
family
greatness
seems
to
consist
in
their
never
having
done
anything
to
distinguish
themselves
for
seven
hundred
years
even
the
long
of
chesney
wold
can
not
revive
spirits
he
is
so
low
that
he
droops
on
the
threshold
and
has
hardly
strength
of
mind
to
enter
but
a
portrait
over
the
painted
by
the
fashionable
artist
of
the
day
acts
upon
him
like
a
charm
he
recovers
in
a
moment
he
stares
at
it
with
uncommon
interest
he
seems
to
be
fixed
and
fascinated
by
it
dear
me
says
guppy
who
that
the
picture
over
the
says
rosa
is
the
portrait
of
the
present
lady
dedlock
it
is
considered
a
perfect
likeness
and
the
best
work
of
the
master
blest
says
guppy
staring
in
a
kind
of
dismay
at
his
friend
if
i
can
ever
have
seen
her
yet
i
know
her
has
the
picture
been
engraved
miss
the
picture
has
never
been
engraved
sir
leicester
has
always
refused
permission
well
says
guppy
in
a
low
voice
i
be
shot
if
it
ai
very
curious
how
well
i
know
that
picture
so
that
lady
dedlock
is
it
the
picture
on
the
right
is
the
present
sir
leicester
dedlock
the
picture
on
the
left
is
his
father
the
late
sir
leicester
guppy
has
no
eyes
for
either
of
these
magnates
unaccountable
to
me
he
says
still
staring
at
the
portrait
how
well
i
know
that
picture
i
dashed
adds
guppy
looking
round
if
i
do
think
i
must
have
had
a
dream
of
that
picture
you
know
as
no
one
present
takes
any
especial
interest
in
guppy
dreams
the
probability
is
not
pursued
but
he
still
remains
so
absorbed
by
the
portrait
that
he
stands
immovable
before
it
until
the
young
gardener
has
closed
the
shutters
when
he
comes
out
of
the
room
in
a
dazed
state
that
is
an
odd
though
a
sufficient
substitute
for
interest
and
follows
into
the
succeeding
rooms
with
a
confused
stare
as
if
he
were
looking
everywhere
for
lady
dedlock
again
he
sees
no
more
of
her
he
sees
her
rooms
which
are
the
last
shown
as
being
very
elegant
and
he
looks
out
of
the
windows
from
which
she
looked
out
not
long
ago
upon
the
weather
that
bored
her
to
death
all
things
have
an
end
even
houses
that
people
take
infinite
pains
to
see
and
are
tired
of
before
they
begin
to
see
them
he
has
come
to
the
end
of
the
sight
and
the
fresh
village
beauty
to
the
end
of
her
description
which
is
always
this
the
terrace
below
is
much
admired
it
is
called
from
an
old
story
in
the
family
the
walk
no
says
guppy
greedily
curious
what
the
story
miss
is
it
anything
about
a
picture
pray
tell
us
the
story
says
watt
in
a
half
whisper
i
do
know
it
sir
rosa
is
shyer
than
ever
it
is
not
related
to
visitors
it
is
almost
forgotten
says
the
housekeeper
advancing
it
has
never
been
more
than
a
family
anecdote
you
excuse
my
asking
again
if
it
has
anything
to
do
with
a
picture
observes
guppy
because
i
do
assure
you
that
the
more
i
think
of
that
picture
the
better
i
know
it
without
knowing
how
i
know
it
the
story
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
picture
the
housekeeper
can
guarantee
that
guppy
is
obliged
to
her
for
the
information
and
is
moreover
generally
obliged
he
retires
with
his
friend
guided
down
another
staircase
by
the
young
gardener
and
presently
is
heard
to
drive
away
it
is
now
dusk
rouncewell
can
trust
to
the
discretion
of
her
two
young
hearers
and
may
tell
them
how
the
terrace
came
to
have
that
ghostly
name
she
seats
herself
in
a
large
chair
by
the
window
and
tells
them
in
the
wicked
days
my
dears
of
king
charles
the
first
i
mean
of
course
in
the
wicked
days
of
the
rebels
who
leagued
themselves
against
that
excellent
king
sir
morbury
dedlock
was
the
owner
of
chesney
wold
whether
there
was
any
account
of
a
ghost
in
the
family
before
those
days
i
ca
say
i
should
think
it
very
likely
indeed
rouncewell
holds
this
opinion
because
she
considers
that
a
family
of
such
antiquity
and
importance
has
a
right
to
a
ghost
she
regards
a
ghost
as
one
of
the
privileges
of
the
upper
classes
a
genteel
distinction
to
which
the
common
people
have
no
claim
sir
morbury
dedlock
says
rouncewell
was
i
have
no
occasion
to
say
on
the
side
of
the
blessed
martyr
but
it
is
supposed
that
his
lady
who
had
none
of
the
family
blood
in
her
veins
favoured
the
bad
cause
it
is
said
that
she
had
relations
among
king
enemies
that
she
was
in
correspondence
with
them
and
that
she
gave
them
information
when
any
of
the
country
gentlemen
who
followed
his
majesty
cause
met
here
it
is
said
that
my
lady
was
always
nearer
to
the
door
of
their
than
they
supposed
do
you
hear
a
sound
like
a
footstep
passing
along
the
terrace
watt
rosa
draws
nearer
to
the
housekeeper
i
hear
the
on
the
stones
replies
the
young
man
and
i
hear
a
curious
echo
i
suppose
an
echo
which
is
very
like
a
halting
step
the
housekeeper
gravely
nods
and
continues
partly
on
account
of
this
division
between
them
and
partly
on
other
accounts
sir
morbury
and
his
lady
led
a
troubled
life
she
was
a
lady
of
a
haughty
temper
they
were
not
well
suited
to
each
other
in
age
or
character
and
they
had
no
children
to
moderate
between
them
after
her
favourite
brother
a
young
gentleman
was
killed
in
the
civil
wars
by
sir
morbury
near
kinsman
her
feeling
was
so
violent
that
she
hated
the
race
into
which
she
had
married
when
the
dedlocks
were
about
to
ride
out
from
chesney
wold
in
the
king
cause
she
is
supposed
to
have
more
than
once
stolen
down
into
the
stables
in
the
dead
of
night
and
lamed
their
horses
and
the
story
is
that
once
at
such
an
hour
her
husband
saw
her
gliding
down
the
stairs
and
followed
her
into
the
stall
where
his
own
favourite
horse
stood
there
he
seized
her
by
the
wrist
and
in
a
struggle
or
in
a
fall
or
through
the
horse
being
frightened
and
lashing
out
she
was
lamed
in
the
hip
and
from
that
hour
began
to
pine
away
the
housekeeper
has
dropped
her
voice
to
a
little
more
than
a
whisper
she
had
been
a
lady
of
a
handsome
figure
and
a
noble
carriage
she
never
complained
of
the
change
she
never
spoke
to
any
one
of
being
crippled
or
of
being
in
pain
but
day
by
day
she
tried
to
walk
upon
the
terrace
and
with
the
help
of
the
stone
balustrade
went
up
and
down
up
and
down
up
and
down
in
sun
and
shadow
with
greater
difficulty
every
day
at
last
one
afternoon
her
husband
to
whom
she
had
never
on
any
persuasion
opened
her
lips
since
that
night
standing
at
the
great
south
window
saw
her
drop
upon
the
pavement
he
hastened
down
to
raise
her
but
she
repulsed
him
as
he
bent
over
her
and
looking
at
him
fixedly
and
coldly
said
will
die
here
where
i
have
walked
and
i
will
walk
here
though
i
am
in
my
grave
i
will
walk
here
until
the
pride
of
this
house
is
humbled
and
when
calamity
or
when
disgrace
is
coming
to
it
let
the
dedlocks
listen
for
my
step
watt
looks
at
rosa
rosa
in
the
deepening
gloom
looks
down
upon
the
ground
half
frightened
and
half
shy
there
and
then
she
died
and
from
those
days
says
rouncewell
the
name
has
come
down
the
ghost
walk
if
the
tread
is
an
echo
it
is
an
echo
that
is
only
heard
after
dark
and
is
often
unheard
for
a
long
while
together
but
it
comes
back
from
time
to
time
and
so
sure
as
there
is
sickness
or
death
in
the
family
it
will
be
heard
then
and
disgrace
grandmother
says
watt
disgrace
never
comes
to
chesney
wold
returns
the
housekeeper
her
grandson
apologizes
with
true
true
that
is
the
story
whatever
the
sound
is
it
is
a
worrying
sound
says
rouncewell
getting
up
from
her
chair
and
what
is
to
be
noticed
in
it
is
that
it
must
be
heard
my
lady
who
is
afraid
of
nothing
admits
that
when
it
is
there
it
must
be
heard
you
can
not
shut
it
out
watt
there
is
a
tall
french
clock
behind
you
placed
there
purpose
that
has
a
loud
beat
when
it
is
in
motion
and
can
play
music
you
understand
how
those
things
are
managed
pretty
well
grandmother
i
think
set
it
watt
sets
it
music
and
all
now
come
hither
says
the
housekeeper
hither
child
towards
my
lady
pillow
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
dark
enough
yet
but
listen
can
you
hear
the
sound
upon
the
terrace
through
the
music
and
the
beat
and
everything
i
certainly
can
so
my
lady
says
chapter
viii
covering
a
multitude
of
sins
it
was
interesting
when
i
dressed
before
daylight
to
peep
out
of
window
where
my
candles
were
reflected
in
the
black
panes
like
two
beacons
and
finding
all
beyond
still
enshrouded
in
the
indistinctness
of
last
night
to
watch
how
it
turned
out
when
the
day
came
on
as
the
prospect
gradually
revealed
itself
and
disclosed
the
scene
over
which
the
wind
had
wandered
in
the
dark
like
my
memory
over
my
life
i
had
a
pleasure
in
discovering
the
unknown
objects
that
had
been
around
me
in
my
sleep
at
first
they
were
faintly
discernible
in
the
mist
and
above
them
the
later
stars
still
glimmered
that
pale
interval
over
the
picture
began
to
enlarge
and
fill
up
so
fast
that
at
every
new
peep
i
could
have
found
enough
to
look
at
for
an
hour
imperceptibly
my
candles
became
the
only
incongruous
part
of
the
morning
the
dark
places
in
my
room
all
melted
away
and
the
day
shone
bright
upon
a
cheerful
landscape
prominent
in
which
the
old
abbey
church
with
its
massive
tower
threw
a
softer
train
of
shadow
on
the
view
than
seemed
compatible
with
its
rugged
character
but
so
from
rough
outsides
i
hope
i
have
learnt
serene
and
gentle
influences
often
proceed
every
part
of
the
house
was
in
such
order
and
every
one
was
so
attentive
to
me
that
i
had
no
trouble
with
my
two
bunches
of
keys
though
what
with
trying
to
remember
the
contents
of
each
little
drawer
and
cupboard
and
what
with
making
notes
on
a
slate
about
jams
and
pickles
and
preserves
and
bottles
and
glass
and
china
and
a
great
many
other
things
and
what
with
being
generally
a
methodical
sort
of
foolish
little
person
i
was
so
busy
that
i
could
not
believe
it
was
when
i
heard
the
bell
ring
away
i
ran
however
and
made
tea
as
i
had
already
been
installed
into
the
responsibility
of
the
and
then
as
they
were
all
rather
late
and
nobody
was
down
yet
i
thought
i
would
take
a
peep
at
the
garden
and
get
some
knowledge
of
that
too
i
found
it
quite
a
delightful
place
in
front
the
pretty
avenue
and
drive
by
which
we
had
approached
and
where
by
the
by
we
had
cut
up
the
gravel
so
terribly
with
our
wheels
that
i
asked
the
gardener
to
roll
it
at
the
back
the
with
my
darling
at
her
window
up
there
throwing
it
open
to
smile
out
at
me
as
if
she
would
have
kissed
me
from
that
distance
beyond
the
was
a
and
then
a
paddock
and
then
a
snug
little
and
then
a
dear
little
as
to
the
house
itself
with
its
three
peaks
in
the
roof
its
windows
some
so
large
some
so
small
and
all
so
pretty
its
against
the
for
roses
and
and
its
homely
comfortable
welcoming
look
it
was
as
ada
said
when
she
came
out
to
meet
me
with
her
arm
through
that
of
its
master
worthy
of
her
cousin
john
a
bold
thing
to
say
though
he
only
pinched
her
dear
cheek
for
it
skimpole
was
as
agreeable
at
breakfast
as
he
had
been
overnight
there
was
honey
on
the
table
and
it
led
him
into
a
discourse
about
bees
he
had
no
objection
to
honey
he
said
and
i
should
think
he
had
not
for
he
seemed
to
like
it
but
he
protested
against
the
overweening
assumptions
of
bees
he
did
at
all
see
why
the
busy
bee
should
be
proposed
as
a
model
to
him
he
supposed
the
bee
liked
to
make
honey
or
he
would
do
it
nobody
asked
him
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
bee
to
make
such
a
merit
of
his
tastes
if
every
confectioner
went
buzzing
about
the
world
banging
against
everything
that
came
in
his
way
and
egotistically
calling
upon
everybody
to
take
notice
that
he
was
going
to
his
work
and
must
not
be
interrupted
the
world
would
be
quite
an
unsupportable
place
then
after
all
it
was
a
ridiculous
position
to
be
smoked
out
of
your
fortune
with
brimstone
as
soon
as
you
had
made
it
you
would
have
a
very
mean
opinion
of
a
manchester
man
if
he
spun
cotton
for
no
other
purpose
he
must
say
he
thought
a
drone
the
embodiment
of
a
pleasanter
and
wiser
idea
the
drone
said
unaffectedly
you
will
excuse
me
i
really
can
not
attend
to
the
shop
i
find
myself
in
a
world
in
which
there
is
so
much
to
see
and
so
short
a
time
to
see
it
in
that
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
looking
about
me
and
begging
to
be
provided
for
by
somebody
who
does
want
to
look
about
him
this
appeared
to
skimpole
to
be
the
drone
philosophy
and
he
thought
it
a
very
good
philosophy
always
supposing
the
drone
to
be
willing
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
bee
which
so
far
as
he
knew
the
easy
fellow
always
was
if
the
consequential
creature
would
only
let
him
and
not
be
so
conceited
about
his
honey
he
pursued
this
fancy
with
the
lightest
foot
over
a
variety
of
ground
and
made
us
all
merry
though
again
he
seemed
to
have
as
serious
a
meaning
in
what
he
said
as
he
was
capable
of
having
i
left
them
still
listening
to
him
when
i
withdrew
to
attend
to
my
new
duties
they
had
occupied
me
for
some
time
and
i
was
passing
through
the
passages
on
my
return
with
my
basket
of
keys
on
my
arm
when
jarndyce
called
me
into
a
small
room
next
his
which
i
found
to
be
in
part
a
little
library
of
books
and
papers
and
in
part
quite
a
little
museum
of
his
boots
and
shoes
and
sit
down
my
dear
said
jarndyce
this
you
must
know
is
the
growlery
when
i
am
out
of
humour
i
come
and
growl
here
you
must
be
here
very
seldom
sir
said
i
oh
you
do
know
me
he
returned
when
i
am
deceived
or
disappointed
in
the
wind
and
it
easterly
i
take
refuge
here
the
growlery
is
the
room
in
the
house
you
are
not
aware
of
half
my
humours
yet
my
dear
how
you
are
trembling
i
could
not
help
it
i
tried
very
hard
but
being
alone
with
that
benevolent
presence
and
meeting
his
kind
eyes
and
feeling
so
happy
and
so
honoured
there
and
my
heart
so
full
i
kissed
his
hand
i
do
know
what
i
said
or
even
that
i
spoke
he
was
disconcerted
and
walked
to
the
window
i
almost
believed
with
an
intention
of
jumping
out
until
he
turned
and
i
was
reassured
by
seeing
in
his
eyes
what
he
had
gone
there
to
hide
he
gently
patted
me
on
the
head
and
i
sat
down
there
there
he
said
that
over
pooh
do
be
foolish
it
shall
not
happen
again
sir
i
returned
but
at
first
it
is
difficult
nonsense
he
said
it
easy
easy
why
not
i
hear
of
a
good
little
orphan
girl
without
a
protector
and
i
take
it
into
my
head
to
be
that
protector
she
grows
up
and
more
than
justifies
my
good
opinion
and
i
remain
her
guardian
and
her
friend
what
is
there
in
all
this
so
so
now
we
have
cleared
off
old
scores
and
i
have
before
me
thy
pleasant
trusting
trusty
face
again
i
said
to
myself
esther
my
dear
you
surprise
me
this
really
is
not
what
i
expected
of
you
and
it
had
such
a
good
effect
that
i
folded
my
hands
upon
my
basket
and
quite
recovered
myself
jarndyce
expressing
his
approval
in
his
face
began
to
talk
to
me
as
confidentially
as
if
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
conversing
with
him
every
morning
for
i
do
know
how
long
i
almost
felt
as
if
i
had
of
course
esther
he
said
you
do
understand
this
chancery
business
and
of
course
i
shook
my
head
i
do
know
who
does
he
returned
the
lawyers
have
twisted
it
into
such
a
state
of
bedevilment
that
the
original
merits
of
the
case
have
long
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
it
about
a
will
and
the
trusts
under
a
will
or
it
was
once
it
about
nothing
but
costs
now
we
are
always
appearing
and
disappearing
and
swearing
and
interrogating
and
filing
and
and
arguing
and
sealing
and
motioning
and
referring
and
reporting
and
revolving
about
the
lord
chancellor
and
all
his
satellites
and
equitably
waltzing
ourselves
off
to
dusty
death
about
costs
that
the
great
question
all
the
rest
by
some
extraordinary
means
has
melted
away
but
it
was
sir
said
i
to
bring
him
back
for
he
began
to
rub
his
head
about
a
will
why
yes
it
was
about
a
will
when
it
was
about
anything
he
returned
a
certain
jarndyce
in
an
evil
hour
made
a
great
fortune
and
made
a
great
will
in
the
question
how
the
trusts
under
that
will
are
to
be
administered
the
fortune
left
by
the
will
is
squandered
away
the
legatees
under
the
will
are
reduced
to
such
a
miserable
condition
that
they
would
be
sufficiently
punished
if
they
had
committed
an
enormous
crime
in
having
money
left
them
and
the
will
itself
is
made
a
dead
letter
all
through
the
deplorable
cause
everything
that
everybody
in
it
except
one
man
knows
already
is
referred
to
that
only
one
man
who
do
know
it
to
find
out
all
through
the
deplorable
cause
everybody
must
have
copies
over
and
over
again
of
everything
that
has
accumulated
about
it
in
the
way
of
cartloads
of
papers
or
must
pay
for
them
without
having
them
which
is
the
usual
course
for
nobody
wants
them
and
must
go
down
the
middle
and
up
again
through
such
an
infernal
of
costs
and
fees
and
nonsense
and
corruption
as
was
never
dreamed
of
in
the
wildest
visions
of
a
witch
sabbath
equity
sends
questions
to
law
law
sends
questions
back
to
equity
law
finds
it
ca
do
this
equity
finds
it
ca
do
that
neither
can
so
much
as
say
it
do
anything
without
this
solicitor
instructing
and
this
counsel
appearing

that

and
that

and
so
on
through
the
whole
alphabet
like
the
history
of
the
apple
pie
and
thus
through
years
and
years
and
lives
and
lives
everything
goes
on
constantly
beginning
over
and
over
again
and
nothing
ever
ends
and
we
ca
get
out
of
the
suit
on
any
terms
for
we
are
made
parties
to
it
and
must
be
parties
to
it
whether
we
like
it
or
not
but
it
wo
do
to
think
of
it
when
my
great
uncle
poor
tom
jarndyce
began
to
think
of
it
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
the
jarndyce
sir
whose
story
i
have
heard
he
nodded
gravely
i
was
his
heir
and
this
was
his
house
esther
when
i
came
here
it
was
bleak
indeed
he
had
left
the
signs
of
his
misery
upon
it
how
changed
it
must
be
now
i
said
it
had
been
called
before
his
time
the
peaks
he
gave
it
its
present
name
and
lived
here
shut
up
day
and
night
poring
over
the
wicked
heaps
of
papers
in
the
suit
and
hoping
against
hope
to
disentangle
it
from
its
mystification
and
bring
it
to
a
close
in
the
meantime
the
place
became
dilapidated
the
wind
whistled
through
the
cracked
walls
the
rain
fell
through
the
broken
roof
the
weeds
choked
the
passage
to
the
rotting
door
when
i
brought
what
remained
of
him
home
here
the
brains
seemed
to
me
to
have
been
blown
out
of
the
house
too
it
was
so
shattered
and
ruined
he
walked
a
little
to
and
fro
after
saying
this
to
himself
with
a
shudder
and
then
looked
at
me
and
brightened
and
came
and
sat
down
again
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
told
you
this
was
the
growlery
my
dear
where
was
i
i
reminded
him
at
the
hopeful
change
he
had
made
in
bleak
house
bleak
house
true
there
is
in
that
city
of
london
there
some
property
of
ours
which
is
much
at
this
day
what
bleak
house
was
then
i
say
property
of
ours
meaning
of
the
suit
but
i
ought
to
call
it
the
property
of
costs
for
costs
is
the
only
power
on
earth
that
will
ever
get
anything
out
of
it
now
or
will
ever
know
it
for
anything
but
an
eyesore
and
a
heartsore
it
is
a
street
of
perishing
blind
houses
with
their
eyes
stoned
out
without
a
pane
of
glass
without
so
much
as
a
with
the
bare
blank
shutters
tumbling
from
their
hinges
and
falling
asunder
the
iron
rails
peeling
away
in
flakes
of
rust
the
chimneys
sinking
in
the
stone
steps
to
every
door
and
every
door
might
be
death
door
turning
stagnant
green
the
very
crutches
on
which
the
ruins
are
propped
decaying
although
bleak
house
was
not
in
chancery
its
master
was
and
it
was
stamped
with
the
same
seal
these
are
the
great
seal
impressions
my
dear
all
over
england
the
children
know
them
how
changed
it
is
i
said
again
why
so
it
is
he
answered
much
more
cheerfully
and
it
is
wisdom
in
you
to
keep
me
to
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
the
idea
of
my
wisdom
these
are
things
i
never
talk
about
or
even
think
about
excepting
in
the
growlery
here
if
you
consider
it
right
to
mention
them
to
rick
and
ada
looking
seriously
at
me
you
can
i
leave
it
to
your
discretion
esther
i
hope
sir
said
i
i
think
you
had
better
call
me
guardian
my
dear
i
felt
that
i
was
choking
again
i
taxed
myself
with
it
esther
now
you
know
you
are
when
he
feigned
to
say
this
slightly
as
if
it
were
a
whim
instead
of
a
thoughtful
tenderness
but
i
gave
the
housekeeping
keys
the
least
shake
in
the
world
as
a
reminder
to
myself
and
folding
my
hands
in
a
still
more
determined
manner
on
the
basket
looked
at
him
quietly
i
hope
guardian
said
i
that
you
may
not
trust
too
much
to
my
discretion
i
hope
you
may
not
mistake
me
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
a
disappointment
to
you
to
know
that
i
am
not
clever
but
it
really
is
the
truth
and
you
would
soon
find
it
out
if
i
had
not
the
honesty
to
confess
it
he
did
not
seem
at
all
disappointed
quite
the
contrary
he
told
me
with
a
smile
all
over
his
face
that
he
knew
me
very
well
indeed
and
that
i
was
quite
clever
enough
for
him
i
hope
i
may
turn
out
so
said
i
but
i
am
much
afraid
of
it
guardian
you
are
clever
enough
to
be
the
good
little
woman
of
our
lives
here
my
dear
he
returned
playfully
the
little
old
woman
of
the
i
do
mean
skimpole
rhyme
old
woman
and
whither
so
high
sweep
the
cobwebs
out
of
the
sky
you
will
sweep
them
so
neatly
out
of
our
sky
in
the
course
of
your
housekeeping
esther
that
one
of
these
days
we
shall
have
to
abandon
the
growlery
and
nail
up
the
door
this
was
the
beginning
of
my
being
called
old
woman
and
little
old
woman
and
cobweb
and
shipton
and
mother
hubbard
and
dame
durden
and
so
many
names
of
that
sort
that
my
own
name
soon
became
quite
lost
among
them
however
said
jarndyce
to
return
to
our
gossip
here
rick
a
fine
young
fellow
full
of
promise
what
to
be
done
with
him
oh
my
goodness
the
idea
of
asking
my
advice
on
such
a
point
here
he
is
esther
said
jarndyce
comfortably
putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
stretching
out
his
legs
he
must
have
a
profession
he
must
make
some
choice
for
himself
there
will
be
a
world
more
wiglomeration
about
it
i
suppose
but
it
must
be
done
more
what
guardian
said
i
more
wiglomeration
said
he
it
the
only
name
i
know
for
the
thing
he
is
a
ward
in
chancery
my
dear
kenge
and
carboy
will
have
something
to
say
about
it
master
somebody
a
sort
of
ridiculous
sexton
digging
graves
for
the
merits
of
causes
in
a
back
room
at
the
end
of
quality
court
chancery
lane
will
have
something
to
say
about
it
counsel
will
have
something
to
say
about
it
the
chancellor
will
have
something
to
say
about
it
the
satellites
will
have
something
to
say
about
it
they
will
all
have
to
be
handsomely
feed
all
round
about
it
the
whole
thing
will
be
vastly
ceremonious
wordy
unsatisfactory
and
expensive
and
i
call
it
in
general
wiglomeration
how
mankind
ever
came
to
be
afflicted
with
wiglomeration
or
for
whose
sins
these
young
people
ever
fell
into
a
pit
of
it
i
do
know
so
it
is
he
began
to
rub
his
head
again
and
to
hint
that
he
felt
the
wind
but
it
was
a
delightful
instance
of
his
kindness
towards
me
that
whether
he
rubbed
his
head
or
walked
about
or
did
both
his
face
was
sure
to
recover
its
benignant
expression
as
it
looked
at
mine
and
he
was
sure
to
turn
comfortable
again
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stretch
out
his
legs
perhaps
it
would
be
best
first
of
all
said
i
to
ask
richard
what
he
inclines
to
himself
exactly
so
he
returned
that
what
i
mean
you
know
just
accustom
yourself
to
talk
it
over
with
your
tact
and
in
your
quiet
way
with
him
and
ada
and
see
what
you
all
make
of
it
we
are
sure
to
come
at
the
heart
of
the
matter
by
your
means
little
woman
i
really
was
frightened
at
the
thought
of
the
importance
i
was
attaining
and
the
number
of
things
that
were
being
confided
to
me
i
had
not
meant
this
at
all
i
had
meant
that
he
should
speak
to
richard
but
of
course
i
said
nothing
in
reply
except
that
i
would
do
my
best
though
i
feared
i
really
felt
it
necessary
to
repeat
this
that
he
thought
me
much
more
sagacious
than
i
was
at
which
my
guardian
only
laughed
the
pleasantest
laugh
i
ever
heard
come
he
said
rising
and
pushing
back
his
chair
i
think
we
may
have
done
with
the
growlery
for
one
day
only
a
concluding
word
esther
my
dear
do
you
wish
to
ask
me
anything
he
looked
so
attentively
at
me
that
i
looked
attentively
at
him
and
felt
sure
i
understood
him
about
myself
sir
said
i
yes
guardian
said
i
venturing
to
put
my
hand
which
was
suddenly
colder
than
i
could
have
wished
in
his
nothing
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
there
were
anything
i
ought
to
know
or
had
any
need
to
know
i
should
not
have
to
ask
you
to
tell
it
to
me
if
my
whole
reliance
and
confidence
were
not
placed
in
you
i
must
have
a
hard
heart
indeed
i
have
nothing
to
ask
you
nothing
in
the
world
he
drew
my
hand
through
his
arm
and
we
went
away
to
look
for
ada
from
that
hour
i
felt
quite
easy
with
him
quite
unreserved
quite
content
to
know
no
more
quite
happy
we
lived
at
first
rather
a
busy
life
at
bleak
house
for
we
had
to
become
acquainted
with
many
residents
in
and
out
of
the
neighbourhood
who
knew
jarndyce
it
seemed
to
ada
and
me
that
everybody
knew
him
who
wanted
to
do
anything
with
anybody
else
money
it
amazed
us
when
we
began
to
sort
his
letters
and
to
answer
some
of
them
for
him
in
the
growlery
of
a
morning
to
find
how
the
great
object
of
the
lives
of
nearly
all
his
correspondents
appeared
to
be
to
form
themselves
into
committees
for
getting
in
and
laying
out
money
the
ladies
were
as
desperate
as
the
gentlemen
indeed
i
think
they
were
even
more
so
they
threw
themselves
into
committees
in
the
most
impassioned
manner
and
collected
subscriptions
with
a
vehemence
quite
extraordinary
it
appeared
to
us
that
some
of
them
must
pass
their
whole
lives
in
dealing
out
to
the
whole
directory
shilling
cards
cards
cards
penny
cards
they
wanted
everything
they
wanted
wearing
apparel
they
wanted
linen
rags
they
wanted
money
they
wanted
coals
they
wanted
soup
they
wanted
interest
they
wanted
autographs
they
wanted
flannel
they
wanted
whatever
jarndyce
had
or
had
not
their
objects
were
as
various
as
their
demands
they
were
going
to
raise
new
buildings
they
were
going
to
pay
off
debts
on
old
buildings
they
were
going
to
establish
in
a
picturesque
building
engraving
of
proposed
west
elevation
attached
the
sisterhood
of
mediaeval
marys
they
were
going
to
give
a
testimonial
to
jellyby
they
were
going
to
have
their
secretary
portrait
painted
and
presented
to
his
whose
deep
devotion
to
him
was
well
known
they
were
going
to
get
up
everything
i
really
believe
from
five
hundred
thousand
tracts
to
an
annuity
and
from
a
marble
monument
to
a
silver
they
took
a
multitude
of
titles
they
were
the
women
of
england
the
daughters
of
britain
the
sisters
of
all
the
cardinal
virtues
separately
the
females
of
america
the
ladies
of
a
hundred
denominations
they
appeared
to
be
always
excited
about
canvassing
and
electing
they
seemed
to
our
poor
wits
and
according
to
their
own
accounts
to
be
constantly
polling
people
by
tens
of
thousands
yet
never
bringing
their
candidates
in
for
anything
it
made
our
heads
ache
to
think
on
the
whole
what
feverish
lives
they
must
lead
among
the
ladies
who
were
most
distinguished
for
this
rapacious
benevolence
if
i
may
use
the
expression
was
a
pardiggle
who
seemed
as
i
judged
from
the
number
of
her
letters
to
jarndyce
to
be
almost
as
powerful
a
correspondent
as
jellyby
herself
we
observed
that
the
wind
always
changed
when
pardiggle
became
the
subject
of
conversation
and
that
it
invariably
interrupted
jarndyce
and
prevented
his
going
any
farther
when
he
had
remarked
that
there
were
two
classes
of
charitable
people
one
the
people
who
did
a
little
and
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
the
other
the
people
who
did
a
great
deal
and
made
no
noise
at
all
we
were
therefore
curious
to
see
pardiggle
suspecting
her
to
be
a
type
of
the
former
class
and
were
glad
when
she
called
one
day
with
her
five
young
sons
she
was
a
formidable
style
of
lady
with
spectacles
a
prominent
nose
and
a
loud
voice
who
had
the
effect
of
wanting
a
great
deal
of
room
and
she
really
did
for
she
knocked
down
little
chairs
with
her
skirts
that
were
quite
a
great
way
off
as
only
ada
and
i
were
at
home
we
received
her
timidly
for
she
seemed
to
come
in
like
cold
weather
and
to
make
the
little
pardiggles
blue
as
they
followed
these
young
ladies
said
pardiggle
with
great
volubility
after
the
first
salutations
are
my
five
boys
you
may
have
seen
their
names
in
a
printed
subscription
list
perhaps
more
than
one
in
the
possession
of
our
esteemed
friend
jarndyce
egbert
my
eldest
twelve
is
the
boy
who
sent
out
his
to
the
amount
of
five
and
threepence
to
the
tockahoopo
indians
oswald
my
second
ten
and
a
half
is
the
child
who
contributed
two
and
to
the
great
national
smithers
testimonial
francis
my
third
nine
one
and
sixpence
halfpenny
felix
my
fourth
seven
eightpence
to
the
superannuated
widows
alfred
my
youngest
five
has
voluntarily
enrolled
himself
in
the
infant
bonds
of
joy
and
is
pledged
never
through
life
to
use
tobacco
in
any
form
we
had
never
seen
such
dissatisfied
children
it
was
not
merely
that
they
were
weazened
and
shrivelled
though
they
were
certainly
that
too
but
they
looked
absolutely
ferocious
with
discontent
at
the
mention
of
the
tockahoopo
indians
i
could
really
have
supposed
egbert
to
be
one
of
the
most
baleful
members
of
that
tribe
he
gave
me
such
a
savage
frown
the
face
of
each
child
as
the
amount
of
his
contribution
was
mentioned
darkened
in
a
peculiarly
vindictive
manner
but
his
was
by
far
the
worst
i
must
except
however
the
little
recruit
into
the
infant
bonds
of
joy
who
was
stolidly
and
evenly
miserable
you
have
been
visiting
i
understand
said
pardiggle
at
mrs
jellyby
we
said
yes
we
had
passed
one
night
there
jellyby
pursued
the
lady
always
speaking
in
the
same
demonstrative
loud
hard
tone
so
that
her
voice
impressed
my
fancy
as
if
it
had
a
sort
of
spectacles
on
too
and
i
may
take
the
opportunity
of
remarking
that
her
spectacles
were
made
the
less
engaging
by
her
eyes
being
what
ada
called
choking
eyes
meaning
very
prominent
jellyby
is
a
benefactor
to
society
and
deserves
a
helping
hand
my
boys
have
contributed
to
the
african
project
egbert
one
and
six
being
the
entire
allowance
of
nine
weeks
oswald
one
and
a
penny
halfpenny
being
the
same
the
rest
according
to
their
little
means
nevertheless
i
do
not
go
with
jellyby
in
all
things
i
do
not
go
with
jellyby
in
her
treatment
of
her
young
family
it
has
been
noticed
it
has
been
observed
that
her
young
family
are
excluded
from
participation
in
the
objects
to
which
she
is
devoted
she
may
be
right
she
may
be
wrong
but
right
or
wrong
this
is
not
my
course
with
my
young
family
i
take
them
everywhere
i
was
afterwards
convinced
and
so
was
ada
that
from
the
eldest
child
these
words
extorted
a
sharp
yell
he
turned
it
off
into
a
yawn
but
it
began
as
a
yell
they
attend
matins
with
me
very
prettily
done
at
six
in
the
morning
all
the
year
round
including
of
course
the
depth
of
winter
said
pardiggle
rapidly
and
they
are
with
me
during
the
revolving
duties
of
the
day
i
am
a
school
lady
i
am
a
visiting
lady
i
am
a
reading
lady
i
am
a
distributing
lady
i
am
on
the
local
linen
box
committee
and
many
general
committees
and
my
canvassing
alone
is
very
extensive
perhaps
no
one
more
so
but
they
are
my
companions
everywhere
and
by
these
means
they
acquire
that
knowledge
of
the
poor
and
that
capacity
of
doing
charitable
business
in
general
in
short
that
taste
for
the
sort
of
thing
which
will
render
them
in
after
life
a
service
to
their
neighbours
and
a
satisfaction
to
themselves
my
young
family
are
not
frivolous
they
expend
the
entire
amount
of
their
allowance
in
subscriptions
under
my
direction
and
they
have
attended
as
many
public
meetings
and
listened
to
as
many
lectures
orations
and
discussions
as
generally
fall
to
the
lot
of
few
grown
people
alfred
five
who
as
i
mentioned
has
of
his
own
election
joined
the
infant
bonds
of
joy
was
one
of
the
very
few
children
who
manifested
consciousness
on
that
occasion
after
a
fervid
address
of
two
hours
from
the
chairman
of
the
evening
alfred
glowered
at
us
as
if
he
never
could
or
would
forgive
the
injury
of
that
night
you
may
have
observed
miss
summerson
said
pardiggle
in
some
of
the
lists
to
which
i
have
referred
in
the
possession
of
our
esteemed
friend
jarndyce
that
the
names
of
my
young
family
are
concluded
with
the
name
of
o
pardiggle
one
pound
that
is
their
father
we
usually
observe
the
same
routine
i
put
down
my
mite
first
then
my
young
family
enrol
their
contributions
according
to
their
ages
and
their
little
means
and
then
pardiggle
brings
up
the
rear
pardiggle
is
happy
to
throw
in
his
limited
donation
under
my
direction
and
thus
things
are
made
not
only
pleasant
to
ourselves
but
we
trust
improving
to
others
suppose
pardiggle
were
to
dine
with
jellyby
and
suppose
jellyby
were
to
relieve
his
mind
after
dinner
to
pardiggle
would
pardiggle
in
return
make
any
confidential
communication
to
jellyby
i
was
quite
confused
to
find
myself
thinking
this
but
it
came
into
my
head
you
are
very
pleasantly
situated
here
said
pardiggle
we
were
glad
to
change
the
subject
and
going
to
the
window
pointed
out
the
beauties
of
the
prospect
on
which
the
spectacles
appeared
to
me
to
rest
with
curious
indifference
you
know
mr
gusher
said
our
visitor
we
were
obliged
to
say
that
we
had
not
the
pleasure
of
acquaintance
the
loss
is
yours
i
assure
you
said
pardiggle
with
her
commanding
deportment
he
is
a
very
fervid
impassioned
speaker
full
of
fire
stationed
in
a
waggon
on
this
lawn
now
which
from
the
shape
of
the
land
is
naturally
adapted
to
a
public
meeting
he
would
improve
almost
any
occasion
you
could
mention
for
hours
and
hours
by
this
time
young
ladies
said
pardiggle
moving
back
to
her
chair
and
overturning
as
if
by
invisible
agency
a
little
round
table
at
a
considerable
distance
with
my
on
it
by
this
time
you
have
found
me
out
i
dare
say
this
was
really
such
a
confusing
question
that
ada
looked
at
me
in
perfect
dismay
as
to
the
guilty
nature
of
my
own
consciousness
after
what
i
had
been
thinking
it
must
have
been
expressed
in
the
colour
of
my
cheeks
found
out
i
mean
said
pardiggle
the
prominent
point
in
my
character
i
am
aware
that
it
is
so
prominent
as
to
be
discoverable
immediately
i
lay
myself
open
to
detection
i
know
well
i
freely
admit
i
am
a
woman
of
business
i
love
hard
work
i
enjoy
hard
work
the
excitement
does
me
good
i
am
so
accustomed
and
inured
to
hard
work
that
i
do
know
what
fatigue
is
we
murmured
that
it
was
very
astonishing
and
very
gratifying
or
something
to
that
effect
i
do
think
we
knew
what
it
was
either
but
this
is
what
our
politeness
expressed
i
do
not
understand
what
it
is
to
be
tired
you
can
not
tire
me
if
you
try
said
pardiggle
the
quantity
of
exertion
which
is
no
exertion
to
me
the
amount
of
business
which
i
regard
as
nothing
that
i
go
through
sometimes
astonishes
myself
i
have
seen
my
young
family
and
pardiggle
quite
worn
out
with
witnessing
it
when
i
may
truly
say
i
have
been
as
fresh
as
a
lark
if
that
eldest
boy
could
look
more
malicious
than
he
had
already
looked
this
was
the
time
when
he
did
it
i
observed
that
he
doubled
his
right
fist
and
delivered
a
secret
blow
into
the
crown
of
his
cap
which
was
under
his
left
arm
this
gives
me
a
great
advantage
when
i
am
making
my
rounds
said
pardiggle
if
i
find
a
person
unwilling
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i
tell
that
person
directly
am
incapable
of
fatigue
my
good
friend
i
am
never
tired
and
i
mean
to
go
on
until
i
have
done
it
answers
admirably
miss
summerson
i
hope
i
shall
have
your
assistance
in
my
visiting
rounds
immediately
and
miss
clare
very
soon
at
first
i
tried
to
excuse
myself
for
the
present
on
the
general
ground
of
having
occupations
to
attend
to
which
i
must
not
neglect
but
as
this
was
an
ineffectual
protest
i
then
said
more
particularly
that
i
was
not
sure
of
my
qualifications
that
i
was
inexperienced
in
the
art
of
adapting
my
mind
to
minds
very
differently
situated
and
addressing
them
from
suitable
points
of
view
that
i
had
not
that
delicate
knowledge
of
the
heart
which
must
be
essential
to
such
a
work
that
i
had
much
to
learn
myself
before
i
could
teach
others
and
that
i
could
not
confide
in
my
good
intentions
alone
for
these
reasons
i
thought
it
best
to
be
as
useful
as
i
could
and
to
render
what
kind
services
i
could
to
those
immediately
about
me
and
to
try
to
let
that
circle
of
duty
gradually
and
naturally
expand
itself
all
this
i
said
with
anything
but
confidence
because
pardiggle
was
much
older
than
i
and
had
great
experience
and
was
so
very
military
in
her
manners
you
are
wrong
miss
summerson
said
she
but
perhaps
you
are
not
equal
to
hard
work
or
the
excitement
of
it
and
that
makes
a
vast
difference
if
you
would
like
to
see
how
i
go
through
my
work
i
am
now
about
with
my
young
family
to
visit
a
brickmaker
in
the
neighbourhood
a
very
bad
character
and
shall
be
glad
to
take
you
with
me
miss
clare
also
if
she
will
do
me
the
favour
ada
and
i
interchanged
looks
and
as
we
were
going
out
in
any
case
accepted
the
offer
when
we
hastily
returned
from
putting
on
our
bonnets
we
found
the
young
family
languishing
in
a
corner
and
pardiggle
sweeping
about
the
room
knocking
down
nearly
all
the
light
objects
it
contained
pardiggle
took
possession
of
ada
and
i
followed
with
the
family
ada
told
me
afterwards
that
pardiggle
talked
in
the
same
loud
tone
that
indeed
i
overheard
all
the
way
to
the
about
an
exciting
contest
which
she
had
for
two
or
three
years
waged
against
another
lady
relative
to
the
bringing
in
of
their
rival
candidates
for
a
pension
somewhere
there
had
been
a
quantity
of
printing
and
promising
and
proxying
and
polling
and
it
appeared
to
have
imparted
great
liveliness
to
all
concerned
except
the
pensioners
who
were
not
elected
yet
i
am
very
fond
of
being
confided
in
by
children
and
am
happy
in
being
usually
favoured
in
that
respect
but
on
this
occasion
it
gave
me
great
uneasiness
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
doors
egbert
with
the
manner
of
a
little
footpad
demanded
a
shilling
of
me
on
the
ground
that
his
was
boned
from
him
on
my
pointing
out
the
great
impropriety
of
the
word
especially
in
connexion
with
his
parent
for
he
added
sulkily
by
her
he
pinched
me
and
said
oh
then
now
who
are
you
you
would
like
it
i
think
what
does
she
make
a
sham
for
and
pretend
to
give
me
money
and
take
it
away
again
why
do
you
call
it
my
allowance
and
never
let
me
spend
it
these
exasperating
questions
so
inflamed
his
mind
and
the
minds
of
oswald
and
francis
that
they
all
pinched
me
at
once
and
in
a
dreadfully
expert
way
screwing
up
such
little
pieces
of
my
arms
that
i
could
hardly
forbear
crying
out
felix
at
the
same
time
stamped
upon
my
toes
and
the
bond
of
joy
who
on
account
of
always
having
the
whole
of
his
little
income
anticipated
stood
in
fact
pledged
to
abstain
from
cakes
as
well
as
tobacco
so
swelled
with
grief
and
rage
when
we
passed
a
shop
that
he
terrified
me
by
becoming
purple
i
never
underwent
so
much
both
in
body
and
mind
in
the
course
of
a
walk
with
young
people
as
from
these
unnaturally
constrained
children
when
they
paid
me
the
compliment
of
being
natural
i
was
glad
when
we
came
to
the
brickmaker
house
though
it
was
one
of
a
cluster
of
wretched
hovels
in
a
with
pigsties
close
to
the
broken
windows
and
miserable
little
gardens
before
the
doors
growing
nothing
but
stagnant
pools
here
and
there
an
old
tub
was
put
to
catch
the
droppings
of
from
a
roof
or
they
were
banked
up
with
mud
into
a
little
pond
like
a
large
at
the
doors
and
windows
some
men
and
women
lounged
or
prowled
about
and
took
little
notice
of
us
except
to
laugh
to
one
another
or
to
say
something
as
we
passed
about
gentlefolks
minding
their
own
business
and
not
troubling
their
heads
and
muddying
their
shoes
with
coming
to
look
after
other
people
pardiggle
leading
the
way
with
a
great
show
of
moral
determination
and
talking
with
much
volubility
about
the
untidy
habits
of
the
people
though
i
doubted
if
the
best
of
us
could
have
been
tidy
in
such
a
place
conducted
us
into
a
cottage
at
the
farthest
corner
the
room
of
which
we
nearly
filled
besides
ourselves
there
were
in
this
damp
offensive
room
a
woman
with
a
black
eye
nursing
a
poor
little
gasping
baby
by
the
fire
a
man
all
stained
with
clay
and
mud
and
looking
very
dissipated
lying
at
full
length
on
the
ground
smoking
a
pipe
a
powerful
young
man
fastening
a
collar
on
a
dog
and
a
bold
girl
doing
some
kind
of
washing
in
very
dirty
water
they
all
looked
up
at
us
as
we
came
in
and
the
woman
seemed
to
turn
her
face
towards
the
fire
as
if
to
hide
her
bruised
eye
nobody
gave
us
any
welcome
well
my
friends
said
pardiggle
but
her
voice
had
not
a
friendly
sound
i
thought
it
was
much
too
and
systematic
how
do
you
do
all
of
you
i
am
here
again
i
told
you
you
could
tire
me
you
know
i
am
fond
of
hard
work
and
am
true
to
my
word
there
a
growled
the
man
on
the
floor
whose
head
rested
on
his
hand
as
he
stared
at
us
any
more
on
you
to
come
in
is
there
no
my
friend
said
pardiggle
seating
herself
on
one
stool
and
knocking
down
another
we
are
all
here
because
i
thought
there
war
enough
of
you
perhaps
said
the
man
with
his
pipe
between
his
lips
as
he
looked
round
upon
us
the
young
man
and
the
girl
both
laughed
two
friends
of
the
young
man
whom
we
had
attracted
to
the
doorway
and
who
stood
there
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
echoed
the
laugh
noisily
you
ca
tire
me
good
people
said
pardiggle
to
these
latter
i
enjoy
hard
work
and
the
harder
you
make
mine
the
better
i
like
it
then
make
it
easy
for
her
growled
the
man
upon
the
floor
i
wants
it
done
and
over
i
wants
a
end
of
these
liberties
took
with
my
place
i
wants
an
end
of
being
drawed
like
a
badger
now
to
and
question
according
to
custom
i
know
what
you
to
be
up
to
well
you
have
got
no
occasion
to
be
up
to
it
i
save
you
the
trouble
is
my
daughter
yes
she
is
look
at
the
water
smell
it
that
wot
we
drinks
how
do
you
like
it
and
what
do
you
think
of
gin
instead
a
my
place
dirty
yes
it
is
dirty
it
dirty
and
onwholesome
and
we
had
five
dirty
and
onwholesome
children
as
is
all
dead
infants
and
so
much
the
better
for
them
and
for
us
besides
have
i
read
the
little
book
wot
you
left
no
i
a
read
the
little
book
wot
you
left
there
a
nobody
here
as
knows
how
to
read
it
and
if
there
wos
it
would
be
suitable
to
me
it
a
book
fit
for
a
babby
and
i
not
a
babby
if
you
was
to
leave
me
a
doll
i
should
nuss
it
how
have
i
been
conducting
of
myself
why
i
been
drunk
for
three
days
and
been
drunk
four
if
had
the
money
do
i
never
mean
for
to
go
to
church
no
i
do
never
mean
for
to
go
to
church
i
should
be
expected
there
if
i
did
the
beadle
too
for
me
and
how
did
my
wife
get
that
black
eye
why
i
give
it
her
and
if
she
says
i
did
she
a
lie
he
had
pulled
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
say
all
this
and
he
now
turned
over
on
his
other
side
and
smoked
again
pardiggle
who
had
been
regarding
him
through
her
spectacles
with
a
forcible
composure
calculated
i
could
not
help
thinking
to
increase
his
antagonism
pulled
out
a
good
book
as
if
it
were
a
constable
staff
and
took
the
whole
family
into
custody
i
mean
into
religious
custody
of
course
but
she
really
did
it
as
if
she
were
an
inexorable
moral
policeman
carrying
them
all
off
to
a
ada
and
i
were
very
uncomfortable
we
both
felt
intrusive
and
out
of
place
and
we
both
thought
that
pardiggle
would
have
got
on
infinitely
better
if
she
had
not
had
such
a
mechanical
way
of
taking
possession
of
people
the
children
sulked
and
stared
the
family
took
no
notice
of
us
whatever
except
when
the
young
man
made
the
dog
bark
which
he
usually
did
when
pardiggle
was
most
emphatic
we
both
felt
painfully
sensible
that
between
us
and
these
people
there
was
an
iron
barrier
which
could
not
be
removed
by
our
new
friend
by
whom
or
how
it
could
be
removed
we
did
not
know
but
we
knew
that
even
what
she
read
and
said
seemed
to
us
to
be
for
such
auditors
if
it
had
been
imparted
ever
so
modestly
and
with
ever
so
much
tact
as
to
the
little
book
to
which
the
man
on
the
floor
had
referred
we
acquired
a
knowledge
of
it
afterwards
and
jarndyce
said
he
doubted
if
robinson
crusoe
could
have
read
it
though
he
had
had
no
other
on
his
desolate
island
we
were
much
relieved
under
these
circumstances
when
pardiggle
left
off
the
man
on
the
floor
then
turning
his
head
round
again
said
morosely
well
you
done
have
you
for
i
have
my
friend
but
i
am
never
fatigued
i
shall
come
to
you
again
in
your
regular
order
returned
pardiggle
with
demonstrative
cheerfulness
so
long
as
you
goes
now
said
he
folding
his
arms
and
shutting
his
eyes
with
an
oath
you
may
do
wot
you
like
pardiggle
accordingly
rose
and
made
a
little
vortex
in
the
confined
room
from
which
the
pipe
itself
very
narrowly
escaped
taking
one
of
her
young
family
in
each
hand
and
telling
the
others
to
follow
closely
and
expressing
her
hope
that
the
brickmaker
and
all
his
house
would
be
improved
when
she
saw
them
next
she
then
proceeded
to
another
cottage
i
hope
it
is
not
unkind
in
me
to
say
that
she
certainly
did
make
in
this
as
in
everything
else
a
show
that
was
not
conciliatory
of
doing
charity
by
wholesale
and
of
dealing
in
it
to
a
large
extent
she
supposed
that
we
were
following
her
but
as
soon
as
the
space
was
left
clear
we
approached
the
woman
sitting
by
the
fire
to
ask
if
the
baby
were
she
only
looked
at
it
as
it
lay
on
her
lap
we
had
observed
before
that
when
she
looked
at
it
she
covered
her
discoloured
eye
with
her
hand
as
though
she
wished
to
separate
any
association
with
noise
and
violence
and
ill
treatment
from
the
poor
little
child
ada
whose
gentle
heart
was
moved
by
its
appearance
bent
down
to
touch
its
little
face
as
she
did
so
i
saw
what
happened
and
drew
her
back
the
child
died
oh
esther
cried
ada
sinking
on
her
knees
beside
it
look
here
oh
esther
my
love
the
little
thing
the
suffering
quiet
pretty
little
thing
i
am
so
sorry
for
it
i
am
so
sorry
for
the
mother
i
never
saw
a
sight
so
pitiful
as
this
before
oh
baby
baby
such
compassion
such
gentleness
as
that
with
which
she
bent
down
weeping
and
put
her
hand
upon
the
mother
might
have
softened
any
mother
heart
that
ever
beat
the
woman
at
first
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
and
then
burst
into
tears
presently
i
took
the
light
burden
from
her
lap
did
what
i
could
to
make
the
baby
rest
the
prettier
and
gentler
laid
it
on
a
shelf
and
covered
it
with
my
own
handkerchief
we
tried
to
comfort
the
mother
and
we
whispered
to
her
what
our
saviour
said
of
children
she
answered
nothing
but
sat
weeping
weeping
very
much
when
i
turned
i
found
that
the
young
man
had
taken
out
the
dog
and
was
standing
at
the
door
looking
in
upon
us
with
dry
eyes
but
quiet
the
girl
was
quiet
too
and
sat
in
a
corner
looking
on
the
ground
the
man
had
risen
he
still
smoked
his
pipe
with
an
air
of
defiance
but
he
was
silent
an
ugly
woman
very
poorly
clothed
hurried
in
while
i
was
glancing
at
them
and
coming
straight
up
to
the
mother
said
jenny
jenny
the
mother
rose
on
being
so
addressed
and
fell
upon
the
woman
neck
she
also
had
upon
her
face
and
arms
the
marks
of
ill
usage
she
had
no
kind
of
grace
about
her
but
the
grace
of
sympathy
but
when
she
condoled
with
the
woman
and
her
own
tears
fell
she
wanted
no
beauty
i
say
condoled
but
her
only
words
were
jenny
jenny
all
the
rest
was
in
the
tone
in
which
she
said
them
i
thought
it
very
touching
to
see
these
two
women
coarse
and
shabby
and
beaten
so
united
to
see
what
they
could
be
to
one
another
to
see
how
they
felt
for
one
another
how
the
heart
of
each
to
each
was
softened
by
the
hard
trials
of
their
lives
i
think
the
best
side
of
such
people
is
almost
hidden
from
us
what
the
poor
are
to
the
poor
is
little
known
excepting
to
themselves
and
god
we
felt
it
better
to
withdraw
and
leave
them
uninterrupted
we
stole
out
quietly
and
without
notice
from
any
one
except
the
man
he
was
leaning
against
the
wall
near
the
door
and
finding
that
there
was
scarcely
room
for
us
to
pass
went
out
before
us
he
seemed
to
want
to
hide
that
he
did
this
on
our
account
but
we
perceived
that
he
did
and
thanked
him
he
made
no
answer
ada
was
so
full
of
grief
all
the
way
home
and
richard
whom
we
found
at
home
was
so
distressed
to
see
her
in
tears
though
he
said
to
me
when
she
was
not
present
how
beautiful
it
was
too
that
we
arranged
to
return
at
night
with
some
little
comforts
and
repeat
our
visit
at
the
house
we
said
as
little
as
we
could
to
jarndyce
but
the
wind
changed
directly
richard
accompanied
us
at
night
to
the
scene
of
our
morning
expedition
on
our
way
there
we
had
to
pass
a
noisy
where
a
number
of
men
were
flocking
about
the
door
among
them
and
prominent
in
some
dispute
was
the
father
of
the
little
child
at
a
short
distance
we
passed
the
young
man
and
the
dog
in
congenial
company
the
sister
was
standing
laughing
and
talking
with
some
other
young
women
at
the
corner
of
the
row
of
cottages
but
she
seemed
ashamed
and
turned
away
as
we
went
by
we
left
our
escort
within
sight
of
the
brickmaker
dwelling
and
proceeded
by
ourselves
when
we
came
to
the
door
we
found
the
woman
who
had
brought
such
consolation
with
her
standing
there
looking
anxiously
out
it
you
young
ladies
is
it
she
said
in
a
whisper
for
my
master
my
heart
in
my
mouth
if
he
was
to
catch
me
away
from
home
he
pretty
near
murder
me
do
you
mean
your
husband
said
i
yes
miss
my
master
jenny
asleep
quite
worn
out
she
scarcely
had
the
child
off
her
lap
poor
thing
these
seven
days
and
nights
except
when
i
been
able
to
take
it
for
a
minute
or
two
as
she
gave
way
for
us
she
went
softly
in
and
put
what
we
had
brought
near
the
miserable
bed
on
which
the
mother
slept
no
effort
had
been
made
to
clean
the
room
it
seemed
in
its
nature
almost
hopeless
of
being
clean
but
the
small
waxen
form
from
which
so
much
solemnity
diffused
itself
had
been
composed
afresh
and
washed
and
neatly
dressed
in
some
fragments
of
white
linen
and
on
my
handkerchief
which
still
covered
the
poor
baby
a
little
bunch
of
sweet
herbs
had
been
laid
by
the
same
rough
scarred
hands
so
lightly
so
tenderly
may
heaven
reward
you
we
said
to
her
you
are
a
good
woman
me
young
ladies
she
returned
with
surprise
hush
jenny
jenny
the
mother
had
moaned
in
her
sleep
and
moved
the
sound
of
the
familiar
voice
seemed
to
calm
her
again
she
was
quiet
once
more
how
little
i
thought
when
i
raised
my
handkerchief
to
look
upon
the
tiny
sleeper
underneath
and
seemed
to
see
a
halo
shine
around
the
child
through
ada
drooping
hair
as
her
pity
bent
her
head
how
little
i
thought
in
whose
unquiet
bosom
that
handkerchief
would
come
to
lie
after
covering
the
motionless
and
peaceful
breast
i
only
thought
that
perhaps
the
angel
of
the
child
might
not
be
all
unconscious
of
the
woman
who
replaced
it
with
so
compassionate
a
hand
not
all
unconscious
of
her
presently
when
we
had
taken
leave
and
left
her
at
the
door
by
turns
looking
and
listening
in
terror
for
herself
and
saying
in
her
old
soothing
manner
jenny
jenny
chapter
ix
signs
and
tokens
i
do
know
how
it
is
i
seem
to
be
always
writing
about
myself
i
mean
all
the
time
to
write
about
other
people
and
i
try
to
think
about
myself
as
little
as
possible
and
i
am
sure
when
i
find
myself
coming
into
the
story
again
i
am
really
vexed
and
say
dear
dear
you
tiresome
little
creature
i
wish
you
would
but
it
is
all
of
no
use
i
hope
any
one
who
may
read
what
i
write
will
understand
that
if
these
pages
contain
a
great
deal
about
me
i
can
only
suppose
it
must
be
because
i
have
really
something
to
do
with
them
and
ca
be
kept
out
my
darling
and
i
read
together
and
worked
and
practised
and
found
so
much
employment
for
our
time
that
the
winter
days
flew
by
us
like
birds
generally
in
the
afternoons
and
always
in
the
evenings
richard
gave
us
his
company
although
he
was
one
of
the
most
restless
creatures
in
the
world
he
certainly
was
very
fond
of
our
society
he
was
very
very
very
fond
of
ada
i
mean
it
and
i
had
better
say
it
at
once
i
had
never
seen
any
young
people
falling
in
love
before
but
i
found
them
out
quite
soon
i
could
not
say
so
of
course
or
show
that
i
knew
anything
about
it
on
the
contrary
i
was
so
demure
and
used
to
seem
so
unconscious
that
sometimes
i
considered
within
myself
while
i
was
sitting
at
work
whether
i
was
not
growing
quite
deceitful
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
be
quiet
and
i
was
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
they
were
as
quiet
as
mice
too
so
far
as
any
words
were
concerned
but
the
innocent
manner
in
which
they
relied
more
and
more
upon
me
as
they
took
more
and
more
to
one
another
was
so
charming
that
i
had
great
difficulty
in
not
showing
how
it
interested
me
our
dear
little
old
woman
is
such
a
capital
old
woman
richard
would
say
coming
up
to
meet
me
in
the
garden
early
with
his
pleasant
laugh
and
perhaps
the
least
tinge
of
a
blush
that
i
get
on
without
her
before
i
begin
my
day
grinding
away
at
those
books
and
instruments
and
then
galloping
up
hill
and
down
dale
all
the
country
round
like
a
highwayman
it
does
me
so
much
good
to
come
and
have
a
steady
walk
with
our
comfortable
friend
that
here
i
am
again
you
know
dame
durden
dear
ada
would
say
at
night
with
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
and
the
firelight
shining
in
her
thoughtful
eyes
i
do
want
to
talk
when
we
come
upstairs
here
only
to
sit
a
little
while
thinking
with
your
dear
face
for
company
and
to
hear
the
wind
and
remember
the
poor
sailors
at
sea
ah
perhaps
richard
was
going
to
be
a
sailor
we
had
talked
it
over
very
often
now
and
there
was
some
talk
of
gratifying
the
inclination
of
his
childhood
for
the
sea
jarndyce
had
written
to
a
relation
of
the
family
a
great
sir
leicester
dedlock
for
his
interest
in
richard
favour
generally
and
sir
leicester
had
replied
in
a
gracious
manner
that
he
would
be
happy
to
advance
the
prospects
of
the
young
gentleman
if
it
should
ever
prove
to
be
within
his
power
which
was
not
at
all
probable
and
that
my
lady
sent
her
compliments
to
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
she
perfectly
remembered
that
she
was
allied
by
remote
consanguinity
and
trusted
that
he
would
ever
do
his
duty
in
any
honourable
profession
to
which
he
might
devote
himself
so
i
apprehend
it
pretty
clear
said
richard
to
me
that
i
shall
have
to
work
my
own
way
never
mind
plenty
of
people
have
had
to
do
that
before
now
and
have
done
it
i
only
wish
i
had
the
command
of
a
clipping
privateer
to
begin
with
and
could
carry
off
the
chancellor
and
keep
him
on
short
allowance
until
he
gave
judgment
in
our
cause
he
find
himself
growing
thin
if
he
did
look
sharp
with
a
buoyancy
and
hopefulness
and
a
gaiety
that
hardly
ever
flagged
richard
had
a
carelessness
in
his
character
that
quite
perplexed
me
principally
because
he
mistook
it
in
such
a
very
odd
way
for
prudence
it
entered
into
all
his
calculations
about
money
in
a
singular
manner
which
i
do
think
i
can
better
explain
than
by
reverting
for
a
moment
to
our
loan
to
skimpole
jarndyce
had
ascertained
the
amount
either
from
skimpole
himself
or
from
coavinses
and
had
placed
the
money
in
my
hands
with
instructions
to
me
to
retain
my
own
part
of
it
and
hand
the
rest
to
richard
the
number
of
little
acts
of
thoughtless
expenditure
which
richard
justified
by
the
recovery
of
his
ten
pounds
and
the
number
of
times
he
talked
to
me
as
if
he
had
saved
or
realized
that
amount
would
form
a
sum
in
simple
addition
my
prudent
mother
hubbard
why
not
he
said
to
me
when
he
wanted
without
the
least
consideration
to
bestow
five
pounds
on
the
brickmaker
i
made
ten
pounds
clear
out
of
coavinses
business
how
was
that
said
i
why
i
got
rid
of
ten
pounds
which
i
was
quite
content
to
get
rid
of
and
never
expected
to
see
any
more
you
do
deny
that
no
said
i
very
well
then
i
came
into
possession
of
ten
pounds
the
same
ten
pounds
i
hinted
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
returned
richard
i
have
got
ten
pounds
more
than
i
expected
to
have
and
consequently
i
can
afford
to
spend
it
without
being
particular
in
exactly
the
same
way
when
he
was
persuaded
out
of
the
sacrifice
of
these
five
pounds
by
being
convinced
that
it
would
do
no
good
he
carried
that
sum
to
his
credit
and
drew
upon
it
let
me
see
he
would
say
i
saved
five
pounds
out
of
the
brickmaker
affair
so
if
i
have
a
good
rattle
to
london
and
back
in
a
and
put
that
down
at
four
pounds
i
shall
have
saved
one
and
it
a
very
good
thing
to
save
one
let
me
tell
you
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
got
i
believe
richard
was
as
frank
and
generous
a
nature
as
there
possibly
can
be
he
was
ardent
and
brave
and
in
the
midst
of
all
his
wild
restlessness
was
so
gentle
that
i
knew
him
like
a
brother
in
a
few
weeks
his
gentleness
was
natural
to
him
and
would
have
shown
itself
abundantly
even
without
ada
influence
but
with
it
he
became
one
of
the
most
winning
of
companions
always
so
ready
to
be
interested
and
always
so
happy
sanguine
and
i
am
sure
that
i
sitting
with
them
and
walking
with
them
and
talking
with
them
and
noticing
from
day
to
day
how
they
went
on
falling
deeper
and
deeper
in
love
and
saying
nothing
about
it
and
each
shyly
thinking
that
this
love
was
the
greatest
of
secrets
perhaps
not
yet
suspected
even
by
the
other
i
am
sure
that
i
was
scarcely
less
enchanted
than
they
were
and
scarcely
less
pleased
with
the
pretty
dream
we
were
going
on
in
this
way
when
one
morning
at
breakfast
jarndyce
received
a
letter
and
looking
at
the
superscription
said
from
boythorn
aye
aye
and
opened
and
read
it
with
evident
pleasure
announcing
to
us
in
a
parenthesis
when
he
was
about
through
that
boythorn
was
coming
down
on
a
visit
now
who
was
boythorn
we
all
thought
and
i
dare
say
we
all
thought
too
i
am
sure
i
did
for
one
would
boythorn
at
all
interfere
with
what
was
going
forward
i
went
to
school
with
this
fellow
lawrence
boythorn
said
jarndyce
tapping
the
letter
as
he
laid
it
on
the
table
more
than
five
and
forty
years
ago
he
was
then
the
most
impetuous
boy
in
the
world
and
he
is
now
the
most
impetuous
man
he
was
then
the
loudest
boy
in
the
world
and
he
is
now
the
loudest
man
he
was
then
the
heartiest
and
sturdiest
boy
in
the
world
and
he
is
now
the
heartiest
and
sturdiest
man
he
is
a
tremendous
fellow
in
stature
sir
asked
richard
pretty
well
rick
in
that
respect
said
jarndyce
being
some
ten
years
older
than
i
and
a
couple
of
inches
taller
with
his
head
thrown
back
like
an
old
soldier
his
stalwart
chest
squared
his
hands
like
a
clean
blacksmith
and
his
lungs
there
no
simile
for
his
lungs
talking
laughing
or
snoring
they
make
the
beams
of
the
house
shake
as
jarndyce
sat
enjoying
the
image
of
his
friend
boythorn
we
observed
the
favourable
omen
that
there
was
not
the
least
indication
of
any
change
in
the
wind
but
it
the
inside
of
the
man
the
warm
heart
of
the
man
the
passion
of
the
man
the
fresh
blood
of
the
man
rick
and
ada
and
little
cobweb
too
for
you
are
all
interested
in
a
visitor
that
i
speak
of
he
pursued
his
language
is
as
sounding
as
his
voice
he
is
always
in
extremes
perpetually
in
the
superlative
degree
in
his
condemnation
he
is
all
ferocity
you
might
suppose
him
to
be
an
ogre
from
what
he
says
and
i
believe
he
has
the
reputation
of
one
with
some
people
there
i
tell
you
no
more
of
him
beforehand
you
must
not
be
surprised
to
see
him
take
me
under
his
protection
for
he
has
never
forgotten
that
i
was
a
low
boy
at
school
and
that
our
friendship
began
in
his
knocking
two
of
my
head
tyrant
teeth
out
he
says
six
before
breakfast
boythorn
and
his
man
to
me
will
be
here
this
afternoon
my
dear
i
took
care
that
the
necessary
preparations
were
made
for
boythorn
reception
and
we
looked
forward
to
his
arrival
with
some
curiosity
the
afternoon
wore
away
however
and
he
did
not
appear
the
arrived
and
still
he
did
not
appear
the
dinner
was
put
back
an
hour
and
we
were
sitting
round
the
fire
with
no
light
but
the
blaze
when
the
suddenly
burst
open
and
the
hall
resounded
with
these
words
uttered
with
the
greatest
vehemence
and
in
a
stentorian
tone
we
have
been
misdirected
jarndyce
by
a
most
abandoned
ruffian
who
told
us
to
take
the
turning
to
the
right
instead
of
to
the
left
he
is
the
most
intolerable
scoundrel
on
the
face
of
the
earth
his
father
must
have
been
a
most
consummate
villain
ever
to
have
such
a
son
i
would
have
had
that
fellow
shot
without
the
least
remorse
did
he
do
it
on
purpose
jarndyce
inquired
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
scoundrel
has
passed
his
whole
existence
in
misdirecting
travellers
returned
the
other
by
my
soul
i
thought
him
the
dog
i
had
ever
beheld
when
he
was
telling
me
to
take
the
turning
to
the
right
and
yet
i
stood
before
that
fellow
face
to
face
and
did
knock
his
brains
out
teeth
you
mean
said
jarndyce
ha
ha
ha
laughed
lawrence
boythorn
really
making
the
whole
house
vibrate
what
you
have
not
forgotten
it
yet
ha
ha
ha
and
that
was
another
most
consummate
vagabond
by
my
soul
the
countenance
of
that
fellow
when
he
was
a
boy
was
the
blackest
image
of
perfidy
cowardice
and
cruelty
ever
set
up
as
a
scarecrow
in
a
field
of
scoundrels
if
i
were
to
meet
that
most
unparalleled
despot
in
the
streets
i
would
fell
him
like
a
rotten
tree
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
jarndyce
now
will
you
come
upstairs
by
my
soul
jarndyce
returned
his
guest
who
seemed
to
refer
to
his
watch
if
you
had
been
married
i
would
have
turned
back
at
the
and
gone
away
to
the
remotest
summits
of
the
himalaya
mountains
sooner
than
i
would
have
presented
myself
at
this
unseasonable
hour
not
quite
so
far
i
hope
said
jarndyce
by
my
life
and
honour
yes
cried
the
visitor
i
would
be
guilty
of
the
audacious
insolence
of
keeping
a
lady
of
the
house
waiting
all
this
time
for
any
earthly
consideration
i
would
infinitely
rather
destroy
myself
infinitely
rather
talking
thus
they
went
upstairs
and
presently
we
heard
him
in
his
bedroom
thundering
ha
ha
ha
and
again
ha
ha
ha
until
the
flattest
echo
in
the
neighbourhood
seemed
to
catch
the
contagion
and
to
laugh
as
enjoyingly
as
he
did
or
as
we
did
when
we
heard
him
laugh
we
all
conceived
a
prepossession
in
his
favour
for
there
was
a
sterling
quality
in
this
laugh
and
in
his
vigorous
healthy
voice
and
in
the
roundness
and
fullness
with
which
he
uttered
every
word
he
spoke
and
in
the
very
fury
of
his
superlatives
which
seemed
to
go
off
like
blank
cannons
and
hurt
nothing
but
we
were
hardly
prepared
to
have
it
so
confirmed
by
his
appearance
when
jarndyce
presented
him
he
was
not
only
a
very
handsome
old
gentleman
upright
and
stalwart
as
he
had
been
described
to
us
with
a
massive
grey
head
a
fine
composure
of
face
when
silent
a
figure
that
might
have
become
corpulent
but
for
his
being
so
continually
in
earnest
that
he
gave
it
no
rest
and
a
chin
that
might
have
subsided
into
a
double
chin
but
for
the
vehement
emphasis
in
which
it
was
constantly
required
to
assist
but
he
was
such
a
true
gentleman
in
his
manner
so
chivalrously
polite
his
face
was
lighted
by
a
smile
of
so
much
sweetness
and
tenderness
and
it
seemed
so
plain
that
he
had
nothing
to
hide
but
showed
himself
exactly
as
he
was
incapable
as
richard
said
of
anything
on
a
limited
scale
and
firing
away
with
those
blank
great
guns
because
he
carried
no
small
arms
whatever
that
really
i
could
not
help
looking
at
him
with
equal
pleasure
as
he
sat
at
dinner
whether
he
smilingly
conversed
with
ada
and
me
or
was
led
by
jarndyce
into
some
great
volley
of
superlatives
or
threw
up
his
head
like
a
bloodhound
and
gave
out
that
tremendous
ha
ha
ha
you
have
brought
your
bird
with
you
i
suppose
said
jarndyce
by
heaven
he
is
the
most
astonishing
bird
in
europe
replied
the
other
he
is
the
most
wonderful
creature
i
would
take
ten
thousand
guineas
for
that
bird
i
have
left
an
annuity
for
his
sole
support
in
case
he
should
outlive
me
he
is
in
sense
and
attachment
a
phenomenon
and
his
father
before
him
was
one
of
the
most
astonishing
birds
that
ever
lived
the
subject
of
this
laudation
was
a
very
little
canary
who
was
so
tame
that
he
was
brought
down
by
boythorn
man
on
his
forefinger
and
after
taking
a
gentle
flight
round
the
room
alighted
on
his
master
head
to
hear
boythorn
presently
expressing
the
most
implacable
and
passionate
sentiments
with
this
fragile
mite
of
a
creature
quietly
perched
on
his
forehead
was
to
have
a
good
illustration
of
his
character
i
thought
by
my
soul
jarndyce
he
said
very
gently
holding
up
a
bit
of
bread
to
the
canary
to
peck
at
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
seize
every
master
in
chancery
by
the
throat
morning
and
shake
him
until
his
money
rolled
out
of
his
pockets
and
his
bones
rattled
in
his
skin
i
would
have
a
settlement
out
of
somebody
by
fair
means
or
by
foul
if
you
would
empower
me
to
do
it
i
would
do
it
for
you
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
all
this
time
the
very
small
canary
was
eating
out
of
his
hand
i
thank
you
lawrence
but
the
suit
is
hardly
at
such
a
point
at
present
returned
jarndyce
laughing
that
it
would
be
greatly
advanced
even
by
the
legal
process
of
shaking
the
bench
and
the
whole
bar
there
never
was
such
an
infernal
cauldron
as
that
chancery
on
the
face
of
the
earth
said
boythorn
nothing
but
a
mine
below
it
on
a
busy
day
in
term
time
with
all
its
records
rules
and
precedents
collected
in
it
and
every
functionary
belonging
to
it
also
high
and
low
upward
and
downward
from
its
son
the
to
its
father
the
devil
and
the
whole
blown
to
atoms
with
ten
thousand
hundredweight
of
gunpowder
would
reform
it
in
the
least
it
was
impossible
not
to
laugh
at
the
energetic
gravity
with
which
he
recommended
this
strong
measure
of
reform
when
we
laughed
he
threw
up
his
head
and
shook
his
broad
chest
and
again
the
whole
country
seemed
to
echo
to
his
ha
ha
ha
it
had
not
the
least
effect
in
disturbing
the
bird
whose
sense
of
security
was
complete
and
who
hopped
about
the
table
with
its
quick
head
now
on
this
side
and
now
on
that
turning
its
bright
sudden
eye
on
its
master
as
if
he
were
no
more
than
another
bird
but
how
do
you
and
your
neighbour
get
on
about
the
disputed
right
of
way
said
jarndyce
you
are
not
free
from
the
toils
of
the
law
yourself
the
fellow
has
brought
actions
against
me
for
trespass
and
i
have
brought
actions
against
him
for
trespass
returned
boythorn
by
heaven
he
is
the
proudest
fellow
breathing
it
is
morally
impossible
that
his
name
can
be
sir
leicester
it
must
be
sir
lucifer
complimentary
to
our
distant
relation
said
my
guardian
laughingly
to
ada
and
richard
i
would
beg
miss
clare
pardon
and
carstone
pardon
resumed
our
visitor
if
i
were
not
reassured
by
seeing
in
the
fair
face
of
the
lady
and
the
smile
of
the
gentleman
that
it
is
quite
unnecessary
and
that
they
keep
their
distant
relation
at
a
comfortable
distance
or
he
keeps
us
suggested
richard
by
my
soul
exclaimed
boythorn
suddenly
firing
another
volley
that
fellow
is
and
his
father
was
and
his
grandfather
was
the
most
arrogant
imbecile
numskull
ever
by
some
inexplicable
mistake
of
nature
born
in
any
station
of
life
but
a
the
whole
of
that
family
are
the
most
solemnly
conceited
and
consummate
blockheads
but
it
no
matter
he
should
not
shut
up
my
path
if
he
were
fifty
baronets
melted
into
one
and
living
in
a
hundred
chesney
wolds
one
within
another
like
the
ivory
balls
in
a
chinese
carving
the
fellow
by
his
agent
or
secretary
or
somebody
writes
to
me
leicester
dedlock
baronet
presents
his
compliments
to
lawrence
boythorn
and
has
to
call
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
green
pathway
by
the
old
now
the
property
of
lawrence
boythorn
is
sir
leicester
right
of
way
being
in
fact
a
portion
of
the
park
of
chesney
wold
and
that
sir
leicester
finds
it
convenient
to
close
up
the
same
i
write
to
the
fellow
lawrence
boythorn
presents
his
compliments
to
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
and
has
to
call
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
totally
denies
the
whole
of
sir
leicester
dedlock
positions
on
every
possible
subject
and
has
to
add
in
reference
to
closing
up
the
pathway
that
he
will
be
glad
to
see
the
man
who
may
undertake
to
do
it
the
fellow
sends
a
most
abandoned
villain
with
one
eye
to
construct
a
gateway
i
play
upon
that
execrable
scoundrel
with
a
until
the
breath
is
nearly
driven
out
of
his
body
the
fellow
erects
a
gate
in
the
night
i
chop
it
down
and
burn
it
in
the
morning
he
sends
his
myrmidons
to
come
over
the
fence
and
pass
and
repass
i
catch
them
in
humane
man
traps
fire
split
peas
at
their
legs
play
upon
them
with
the
engine
resolve
to
free
mankind
from
the
insupportable
burden
of
the
existence
of
those
lurking
ruffians
he
brings
actions
for
trespass
i
bring
actions
for
trespass
he
brings
actions
for
assault
and
battery
i
defend
them
and
continue
to
assault
and
batter
ha
ha
ha
to
hear
him
say
all
this
with
unimaginable
energy
one
might
have
thought
him
the
angriest
of
mankind
to
see
him
at
the
very
same
time
looking
at
the
bird
now
perched
upon
his
thumb
and
softly
smoothing
its
feathers
with
his
forefinger
one
might
have
thought
him
the
gentlest
to
hear
him
laugh
and
see
the
broad
good
nature
of
his
face
then
one
might
have
supposed
that
he
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
or
a
dispute
or
a
dislike
but
that
his
whole
existence
was
a
summer
joke
no
no
he
said
no
closing
up
of
my
paths
by
any
dedlock
though
i
willingly
confess
here
he
softened
in
a
moment
that
lady
dedlock
is
the
most
accomplished
lady
in
the
world
to
whom
i
would
do
any
homage
that
a
plain
gentleman
and
no
baronet
with
a
head
seven
hundred
years
thick
may
a
man
who
joined
his
regiment
at
twenty
and
within
a
week
challenged
the
most
imperious
and
presumptuous
coxcomb
of
a
commanding
officer
that
ever
drew
the
breath
of
life
through
a
tight
waist
and
got
broke
for
it
is
not
the
man
to
be
walked
over
by
all
the
sir
lucifers
dead
or
alive
locked
or
unlocked
ha
ha
ha
nor
the
man
to
allow
his
junior
to
be
walked
over
either
said
my
guardian
most
assuredly
not
said
boythorn
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
with
an
air
of
protection
that
had
something
serious
in
it
though
he
laughed
he
will
stand
by
the
low
boy
always
jarndyce
you
may
rely
upon
him
but
speaking
of
this
trespass
with
apologies
to
miss
clare
and
miss
summerson
for
the
length
at
which
i
have
pursued
so
dry
a
subject
is
there
nothing
for
me
from
your
men
kenge
and
carboy
i
think
not
esther
said
jarndyce
nothing
guardian
much
obliged
said
boythorn
had
no
need
to
ask
after
even
my
slight
experience
of
miss
summerson
forethought
for
every
one
about
her
they
all
encouraged
me
they
were
determined
to
do
it
i
inquired
because
coming
from
lincolnshire
i
of
course
have
not
yet
been
in
town
and
i
thought
some
letters
might
have
been
sent
down
here
i
dare
say
they
will
report
progress
morning
i
saw
him
so
often
in
the
course
of
the
evening
which
passed
very
pleasantly
contemplate
richard
and
ada
with
an
interest
and
a
satisfaction
that
made
his
fine
face
remarkably
agreeable
as
he
sat
at
a
little
distance
from
the
piano
listening
to
the
music
and
he
had
small
occasion
to
tell
us
that
he
was
passionately
fond
of
music
for
his
face
showed
it
that
i
asked
my
guardian
as
we
sat
at
the
backgammon
board
whether
boythorn
had
ever
been
married
no
said
he
no
but
he
meant
to
be
said
i
how
did
you
find
out
that
he
returned
with
a
smile
why
guardian
i
explained
not
without
reddening
a
little
at
hazarding
what
was
in
my
thoughts
there
is
something
so
tender
in
his
manner
after
all
and
he
is
so
very
courtly
and
gentle
to
us
and
jarndyce
directed
his
eyes
to
where
he
was
sitting
as
i
have
just
described
him
i
said
no
more
you
are
right
little
woman
he
answered
he
was
all
but
married
once
long
ago
and
once
did
the
lady
die
no
but
she
died
to
him
that
time
has
had
its
influence
on
all
his
later
life
would
you
suppose
him
to
have
a
head
and
a
heart
full
of
romance
yet
i
think
guardian
i
might
have
supposed
so
but
it
is
easy
to
say
that
when
you
have
told
me
so
he
has
never
since
been
what
he
might
have
been
said
jarndyce
and
now
you
see
him
in
his
age
with
no
one
near
him
but
his
servant
and
his
little
yellow
friend
it
your
throw
my
dear
i
felt
from
my
guardian
manner
that
beyond
this
point
i
could
not
pursue
the
subject
without
changing
the
wind
i
therefore
forbore
to
ask
any
further
questions
i
was
interested
but
not
curious
i
thought
a
little
while
about
this
old
love
story
in
the
night
when
i
was
awakened
by
boythorn
lusty
snoring
and
i
tried
to
do
that
very
difficult
thing
imagine
old
people
young
again
and
invested
with
the
graces
of
youth
but
i
fell
asleep
before
i
had
succeeded
and
dreamed
of
the
days
when
i
lived
in
my
godmother
house
i
am
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
such
subjects
to
know
whether
it
is
at
all
remarkable
that
i
almost
always
dreamed
of
that
period
of
my
life
with
the
morning
there
came
a
letter
from
kenge
and
carboy
to
boythorn
informing
him
that
one
of
their
clerks
would
wait
upon
him
at
noon
as
it
was
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
i
paid
the
bills
and
added
up
my
books
and
made
all
the
household
affairs
as
compact
as
possible
i
remained
at
home
while
jarndyce
ada
and
richard
took
advantage
of
a
very
fine
day
to
make
a
little
excursion
boythorn
was
to
wait
for
kenge
and
carboy
clerk
and
then
was
to
go
on
foot
to
meet
them
on
their
return
well
i
was
full
of
business
examining
tradesmen
books
adding
up
columns
paying
money
filing
receipts
and
i
dare
say
making
a
great
bustle
about
it
when
guppy
was
announced
and
shown
in
i
had
had
some
idea
that
the
clerk
who
was
to
be
sent
down
might
be
the
young
gentleman
who
had
met
me
at
the
and
i
was
glad
to
see
him
because
he
was
associated
with
my
present
happiness
i
scarcely
knew
him
again
he
was
so
uncommonly
smart
he
had
an
entirely
new
suit
of
glossy
clothes
on
a
shining
hat
gloves
a
neckerchief
of
a
variety
of
colours
a
large
flower
in
his
and
a
thick
gold
ring
on
his
little
finger
besides
which
he
quite
scented
the
with
and
other
perfumery
he
looked
at
me
with
an
attention
that
quite
confused
me
when
i
begged
him
to
take
a
seat
until
the
servant
should
return
and
as
he
sat
there
crossing
and
uncrossing
his
legs
in
a
corner
and
i
asked
him
if
he
had
had
a
pleasant
ride
and
hoped
that
kenge
was
well
i
never
looked
at
him
but
i
found
him
looking
at
me
in
the
same
scrutinizing
and
curious
way
when
the
request
was
brought
to
him
that
he
would
go
upstairs
to
boythorn
room
i
mentioned
that
he
would
find
lunch
prepared
for
him
when
he
came
down
of
which
jarndyce
hoped
he
would
partake
he
said
with
some
embarrassment
holding
the
handle
of
the
door
shall
i
have
the
honour
of
finding
you
here
miss
i
replied
yes
i
should
be
there
and
he
went
out
with
a
bow
and
another
look
i
thought
him
only
awkward
and
shy
for
he
was
evidently
much
embarrassed
and
i
fancied
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
wait
until
i
saw
that
he
had
everything
he
wanted
and
then
to
leave
him
to
himself
the
lunch
was
soon
brought
but
it
remained
for
some
time
on
the
table
the
interview
with
boythorn
was
a
long
one
and
a
stormy
one
too
i
should
think
for
although
his
room
was
at
some
distance
i
heard
his
loud
voice
rising
every
now
and
then
like
a
high
wind
and
evidently
blowing
perfect
broadsides
of
denunciation
at
last
guppy
came
back
looking
something
the
worse
for
the
conference
my
eye
miss
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
a
tartar
pray
take
some
refreshment
sir
said
guppy
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
nervously
sharpening
the
on
the
still
looking
at
me
as
i
felt
quite
sure
without
looking
at
him
in
the
same
unusual
manner
the
sharpening
lasted
so
long
that
at
last
i
felt
a
kind
of
obligation
on
me
to
raise
my
eyes
in
order
that
i
might
break
the
spell
under
which
he
seemed
to
labour
of
not
being
able
to
leave
off
he
immediately
looked
at
the
dish
and
began
to
carve
what
will
you
take
yourself
miss
you
take
a
morsel
of
something
no
thank
you
said
i
sha
i
give
you
a
piece
of
anything
at
all
miss
said
guppy
hurriedly
drinking
off
a
glass
of
wine
nothing
thank
you
said
i
i
have
only
waited
to
see
that
you
have
everything
you
want
is
there
anything
i
can
order
for
you
no
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
miss
i
sure
i
everything
that
i
can
require
to
make
me
comfortable
at
least
i
not
comfortable
never
that
he
drank
off
two
more
glasses
of
wine
one
after
another
i
thought
i
had
better
go
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
said
guppy
rising
when
he
saw
me
rise
but
would
you
allow
me
the
favour
of
a
minute
private
conversation
not
knowing
what
to
say
i
sat
down
again
what
follows
is
without
prejudice
miss
said
guppy
anxiously
bringing
a
chair
towards
my
table
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
said
i
wondering
it
one
of
our
law
terms
miss
you
wo
make
any
use
of
it
to
my
detriment
at
kenge
and
carboy
or
elsewhere
if
our
conversation
should
lead
to
anything
i
am
to
be
as
i
was
and
am
not
to
be
prejudiced
in
my
situation
or
worldly
prospects
in
short
it
in
total
confidence
i
am
at
a
loss
sir
said
i
to
imagine
what
you
can
have
to
communicate
in
total
confidence
to
me
whom
you
have
never
seen
but
once
but
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
do
you
any
injury
thank
you
miss
i
sure
of
it
that
quite
sufficient
all
this
time
guppy
was
either
planing
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
or
tightly
rubbing
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
the
palm
of
his
right
if
you
would
excuse
my
taking
another
glass
of
wine
miss
i
think
it
might
assist
me
in
getting
on
without
a
continual
choke
that
can
not
fail
to
be
mutually
unpleasant
he
did
so
and
came
back
again
i
took
the
opportunity
of
moving
well
behind
my
table
you
would
allow
me
to
offer
you
one
would
you
miss
said
guppy
apparently
refreshed
not
any
said
i
not
half
a
glass
said
guppy
quarter
no
then
to
proceed
my
present
salary
miss
summerson
at
kenge
and
carboy
is
two
pound
a
week
when
i
first
had
the
happiness
of
looking
upon
you
it
was
one
fifteen
and
had
stood
at
that
figure
for
a
lengthened
period
a
rise
of
five
has
since
taken
place
and
a
further
rise
of
five
is
guaranteed
at
the
expiration
of
a
term
not
exceeding
twelve
months
from
the
present
date
my
mother
has
a
little
property
which
takes
the
form
of
a
small
life
annuity
upon
which
she
lives
in
an
independent
though
unassuming
manner
in
the
old
street
road
she
is
eminently
calculated
for
a
she
never
interferes
is
all
for
peace
and
her
disposition
easy
she
has
her
failings
as
who
has
not
but
i
never
knew
her
do
it
when
company
was
present
at
which
time
you
may
freely
trust
her
with
wines
spirits
or
malt
liquors
my
own
abode
is
lodgings
at
penton
place
pentonville
it
is
lowly
but
airy
open
at
the
back
and
considered
one
of
the
outlets
miss
summerson
in
the
mildest
language
i
adore
you
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
allow
me
as
i
may
say
to
file
a
declaration
to
make
an
offer
guppy
went
down
on
his
knees
i
was
well
behind
my
table
and
not
much
frightened
i
said
get
up
from
that
ridiculous
position
immediately
sir
or
you
will
oblige
me
to
break
my
implied
promise
and
ring
the
bell
hear
me
out
miss
said
guppy
folding
his
hands
i
can
not
consent
to
hear
another
word
sir
i
returned
unless
you
get
up
from
the
carpet
directly
and
go
and
sit
down
at
the
table
as
you
ought
to
do
if
you
have
any
sense
at
all
he
looked
piteously
but
slowly
rose
and
did
so
yet
what
a
mockery
it
is
miss
he
said
with
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
shaking
his
head
at
me
in
a
melancholy
manner
over
the
tray
to
be
stationed
behind
food
at
such
a
moment
the
soul
recoils
from
food
at
such
a
moment
miss
i
beg
you
to
conclude
said
i
you
have
asked
me
to
hear
you
out
and
i
beg
you
to
conclude
i
will
miss
said
guppy
as
i
love
and
honour
so
likewise
i
obey
would
that
i
could
make
thee
the
subject
of
that
vow
before
the
shrine
that
is
quite
impossible
said
i
and
entirely
out
of
the
question
i
am
aware
said
guppy
leaning
forward
over
the
tray
and
regarding
me
as
i
again
strangely
felt
though
my
eyes
were
not
directed
to
him
with
his
late
intent
look
i
am
aware
that
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
according
to
all
appearances
my
offer
is
a
poor
one
but
miss
summerson
angel
no
do
ring
i
have
been
brought
up
in
a
sharp
school
and
am
accustomed
to
a
variety
of
general
practice
though
a
young
man
i
have
ferreted
out
evidence
got
up
cases
and
seen
lots
of
life
blest
with
your
hand
what
means
might
i
not
find
of
advancing
your
interests
and
pushing
your
fortunes
what
might
i
not
get
to
know
nearly
concerning
you
i
know
nothing
now
certainly
but
what
might
i
not
if
i
had
your
confidence
and
you
set
me
on
i
told
him
that
he
addressed
my
interest
or
what
he
supposed
to
be
my
interest
quite
as
unsuccessfully
as
he
addressed
my
inclination
and
he
would
now
understand
that
i
requested
him
if
he
pleased
to
go
away
immediately
cruel
miss
said
guppy
hear
but
another
word
i
think
you
must
have
seen
that
i
was
struck
with
those
charms
on
the
day
when
i
waited
at
the
whytorseller
i
think
you
must
have
remarked
that
i
could
not
forbear
a
tribute
to
those
charms
when
i
put
up
the
steps
of
the
it
was
a
feeble
tribute
to
thee
but
it
was
well
meant
thy
image
has
ever
since
been
fixed
in
my
breast
i
have
walked
up
and
down
of
an
evening
opposite
jellyby
house
only
to
look
upon
the
bricks
that
once
contained
thee
this
out
of
quite
an
unnecessary
out
so
far
as
the
attendance
which
was
its
pretended
object
went
was
planned
by
me
alone
for
thee
alone
if
i
speak
of
interest
it
is
only
to
recommend
myself
and
my
respectful
wretchedness
love
was
before
it
and
is
before
it
i
should
be
pained
guppy
said
i
rising
and
putting
my
hand
upon
the
to
do
you
or
any
one
who
was
sincere
the
injustice
of
slighting
any
honest
feeling
however
disagreeably
expressed
if
you
have
really
meant
to
give
me
a
proof
of
your
good
opinion
though
and
misplaced
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
thank
you
i
have
very
little
reason
to
be
proud
and
i
am
not
proud
i
hope
i
think
i
added
without
very
well
knowing
what
i
said
that
you
will
now
go
away
as
if
you
had
never
been
so
exceedingly
foolish
and
attend
to
kenge
and
carboy
business
half
a
minute
miss
cried
guppy
checking
me
as
i
was
about
to
ring
this
has
been
without
prejudice
i
will
never
mention
it
said
i
unless
you
should
give
me
future
occasion
to
do
so
a
quarter
of
a
minute
miss
in
case
you
should
think
better
at
any
time
however
distant
that
no
consequence
for
my
feelings
can
never
alter
of
anything
i
have
said
particularly
what
might
i
not
do
william
guppy
penton
place
or
if
removed
or
dead
of
blighted
hopes
or
anything
of
that
sort
care
of
guppy
three
hundred
and
two
old

road
will
be
sufficient
i
rang
the
bell
the
servant
came
and
guppy
laying
his
written
card
upon
the
table
and
making
a
dejected
bow
departed
raising
my
eyes
as
he
went
out
i
once
more
saw
him
looking
at
me
after
he
had
passed
the
door
i
sat
there
for
another
hour
or
more
finishing
my
books
and
payments
and
getting
through
plenty
of
business
then
i
arranged
my
desk
and
put
everything
away
and
was
so
composed
and
cheerful
that
i
thought
i
had
quite
dismissed
this
unexpected
incident
but
when
i
went
upstairs
to
my
own
room
i
surprised
myself
by
beginning
to
laugh
about
it
and
then
surprised
myself
still
more
by
beginning
to
cry
about
it
in
short
i
was
in
a
flutter
for
a
little
while
and
felt
as
if
an
old
chord
had
been
more
coarsely
touched
than
it
ever
had
been
since
the
days
of
the
dear
old
doll
long
buried
in
the
garden
chapter
x
the
on
the
eastern
borders
of
chancery
lane
that
is
to
say
more
particularly
in
cook
court
cursitor
street
snagsby
pursues
his
lawful
calling
in
the
shade
of
court
at
most
times
a
shady
place
snagsby
has
dealt
in
all
sorts
of
blank
forms
of
legal
process
in
skins
and
rolls
of
parchment
in

foolscap
brief

and

bodkins
and
other
small
in

in
articles
too
numerous
to
mention
ever
since
he
was
out
of
his
time
and
went
into
partnership
with
peffer
on
that
occasion
cook
court
was
in
a
manner
revolutionized
by
the
new
inscription
in
fresh
paint
peffer
and
snagsby
displacing
the
and
not
easily
to
be
deciphered
legend
peffer
only
for
smoke
which
is
the
london
ivy
had
so
wreathed
itself
round
name
and
clung
to
his
that
the
affectionate
parasite
quite
overpowered
the
parent
tree
peffer
is
never
seen
in
cook
court
now
he
is
not
expected
there
for
he
has
been
recumbent
this
quarter
of
a
century
in
the
churchyard
of
andrews
holborn
with
the
waggons
and
roaring
past
him
all
the
day
and
half
the
night
like
one
great
dragon
if
he
ever
steal
forth
when
the
dragon
is
at
rest
to
air
himself
again
in
cook
court
until
admonished
to
return
by
the
crowing
of
the
sanguine
cock
in
the
cellar
at
the
little
dairy
in
cursitor
street
whose
ideas
of
daylight
it
would
be
curious
to
ascertain
since
he
knows
from
his
personal
observation
next
to
nothing
about
it
if
peffer
ever
do
revisit
the
pale
glimpses
of
cook
court
which
no
in
the
trade
can
positively
deny
he
comes
invisibly
and
no
one
is
the
worse
or
wiser
in
his
lifetime
and
likewise
in
the
period
of
snagsby
time
of
seven
long
years
there
dwelt
with
peffer
in
the
same
premises
a
niece
a
short
shrewd
niece
something
too
violently
compressed
about
the
waist
and
with
a
sharp
nose
like
a
sharp
autumn
evening
inclining
to
be
frosty
towards
the
end
the
cook
courtiers
had
a
rumour
flying
among
them
that
the
mother
of
this
niece
did
in
her
daughter
childhood
moved
by
too
jealous
a
solicitude
that
her
figure
should
approach
perfection
lace
her
up
every
morning
with
her
maternal
foot
against
the
for
a
stronger
hold
and
purchase
and
further
that
she
exhibited
internally
pints
of
vinegar
and
which
acids
they
held
had
mounted
to
the
nose
and
temper
of
the
patient
with
whichsoever
of
the
many
tongues
of
rumour
this
frothy
report
originated
it
either
never
reached
or
never
influenced
the
ears
of
young
snagsby
who
having
wooed
and
won
its
fair
subject
on
his
arrival
at
estate
entered
into
two
partnerships
at
once
so
now
in
court
cursitor
street
snagsby
and
the
niece
are
one
and
the
niece
still
cherishes
her
figure
which
however
tastes
may
differ
is
unquestionably
so
far
precious
that
there
is
mighty
little
of
it
and
snagsby
are
not
only
one
bone
and
one
flesh
but
to
the
neighbours
thinking
one
voice
too
that
voice
appearing
to
proceed
from
snagsby
alone
is
heard
in
cook
court
very
often
snagsby
otherwise
than
as
he
finds
expression
through
these
dulcet
tones
is
rarely
heard
he
is
a
mild
bald
timid
man
with
a
shining
head
and
a
scrubby
clump
of
black
hair
sticking
out
at
the
back
he
tends
to
meekness
and
obesity
as
he
stands
at
his
door
in
court
in
his
grey
and
black
calico
sleeves
looking
up
at
the
clouds
or
stands
behind
a
desk
in
his
dark
shop
with
a
heavy
flat
ruler
snipping
and
slicing
at
sheepskin
in
company
with
his
two
he
is
emphatically
a
retiring
and
unassuming
man
from
beneath
his
feet
at
such
times
as
from
a
shrill
ghost
unquiet
in
its
grave
there
frequently
arise
complainings
and
lamentations
in
the
voice
already
mentioned
and
haply
on
some
occasions
when
these
reach
a
sharper
pitch
than
usual
snagsby
mentions
to
the
i
think
my
little
woman
is
it
to
guster
this
proper
name
so
used
by
snagsby
has
before
now
sharpened
the
wit
of
the
cook
courtiers
to
remark
that
it
ought
to
be
the
name
of
snagsby
seeing
that
she
might
with
great
force
and
expression
be
termed
a
guster
in
compliment
to
her
stormy
character
it
is
however
the
possession
and
the
only
possession
except
fifty
shillings
per
annum
and
a
very
small
box
indifferently
filled
with
clothing
of
a
lean
young
woman
from
a
workhouse
by
some
supposed
to
have
been
christened
augusta
who
although
she
was
farmed
or
contracted
for
during
her
growing
time
by
an
amiable
benefactor
of
his
species
resident
at
tooting
and
can
not
fail
to
have
been
developed
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
has
fits
which
the
parish
ca
account
for
guster
really
aged
three
or
four
and
twenty
but
looking
a
round
ten
years
older
goes
cheap
with
this
unaccountable
drawback
of
fits
and
is
so
apprehensive
of
being
returned
on
the
hands
of
her
patron
saint
that
except
when
she
is
found
with
her
head
in
the
pail
or
the
sink
or
the
copper
or
the
dinner
or
anything
else
that
happens
to
be
near
her
at
the
time
of
her
seizure
she
is
always
at
work
she
is
a
satisfaction
to
the
parents
and
guardians
of
the
who
feel
that
there
is
little
danger
of
her
inspiring
tender
emotions
in
the
breast
of
youth
she
is
a
satisfaction
to
snagsby
who
can
always
find
fault
with
her
she
is
a
satisfaction
to
snagsby
who
thinks
it
a
charity
to
keep
her
the
establishment
is
in
guster
eyes
a
temple
of
plenty
and
splendour
she
believes
the
little
upstairs
always
kept
as
one
may
say
with
its
hair
in
papers
and
its
pinafore
on
to
be
the
most
elegant
apartment
in
christendom
the
view
it
commands
of
cook
court
at
one
end
not
to
mention
a
squint
into
cursitor
street
and
of
the
sheriff
officer
backyard
at
the
other
she
regards
as
a
prospect
of
unequalled
beauty
the
portraits
it
displays
in
oil
and
plenty
of
it
too
of
snagsby
looking
at
snagsby
and
of
snagsby
looking
at
snagsby
are
in
her
eyes
as
achievements
of
raphael
or
titian
guster
has
some
recompenses
for
her
many
privations
snagsby
refers
everything
not
in
the
practical
mysteries
of
the
business
to
snagsby
she
manages
the
money
reproaches
the
appoints
the
times
and
places
of
devotion
on
sundays
licenses
snagsby
entertainments
and
acknowledges
no
responsibility
as
to
what
she
thinks
fit
to
provide
for
dinner
insomuch
that
she
is
the
high
standard
of
comparison
among
the
neighbouring
wives
a
long
way
down
chancery
lane
on
both
sides
and
even
out
in
holborn
who
in
any
domestic
passages
of
arms
habitually
call
upon
their
husbands
to
look
at
the
difference
between
their
the
wives
position
and
snagsby
and
their
the
husbands
behaviour
and
snagsby
rumour
always
flying
about
cook
court
and
skimming
in
and
out
at
everybody
windows
does
say
that
snagsby
is
jealous
and
inquisitive
and
that
snagsby
is
sometimes
worried
out
of
house
and
home
and
that
if
he
had
the
spirit
of
a
mouse
he
would
stand
it
it
is
even
observed
that
the
wives
who
quote
him
to
their
husbands
as
a
shining
example
in
reality
look
down
upon
him
and
that
nobody
does
so
with
greater
superciliousness
than
one
particular
lady
whose
lord
is
more
than
suspected
of
laying
his
umbrella
on
her
as
an
instrument
of
correction
but
these
vague
whisperings
may
arise
from
being
in
his
way
rather
a
meditative
and
poetical
man
loving
to
walk
in
staple
inn
in
the
and
to
observe
how
countrified
the
sparrows
and
the
leaves
are
also
to
lounge
about
the
rolls
yard
of
a
sunday
afternoon
and
to
remark
if
in
good
spirits
that
there
were
old
times
once
and
that
you
find
a
stone
coffin
or
two
now
under
that
chapel
he
be
bound
if
you
was
to
dig
for
it
he
solaces
his
imagination
too
by
thinking
of
the
many
chancellors
and
vices
and
masters
of
the
rolls
who
are
deceased
and
he
gets
such
a
flavour
of
the
country
out
of
telling
the
two
how
he
has
heard
say
that
a
brook
as
clear
as
crystal
once
ran
right
down
the
middle
of
holborn
when
turnstile
really
was
a
turnstile
leading
slap
away
into
the
meadows
gets
such
a
flavour
of
the
country
out
of
this
that
he
never
wants
to
go
there
the
day
is
closing
in
and
the
gas
is
lighted
but
is
not
yet
fully
effective
for
it

dark

standing
at

looking
up
at

a
crow
who
is
out
late

westward
over
the
slice
of

belonging
to
cook
court
the
crow
flies
straight
across

off
in
sets
of
chambers
now
and
in
those
shrunken
fragments
of
its
greatness
lawyers
lie
like
maggots
in
nuts
but
its
roomy
staircases
passages
and
antechambers
still
remain
and
even
its
painted
ceilings
where
allegory
in
roman
helmet
and
celestial
linen
sprawls
among
balustrades
and
pillars
flowers
clouds
and
boys
and
makes
the

ache

always

here
among
his
many
boxes
labelled
with
transcendent
names
lives
tulkinghorn
when
not
speechlessly
at
home
in
where
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
are
bored
to
death
here
he
is
quiet
at
his
table
an
oyster
of
the
old
school
whom
nobody
can
open
like
as
he
is
to
look
at
so
is
his
apartment
in
the
dusk
of
the
present
afternoon
rusty
out
of
date
withdrawing
from
attention
able
to
afford
it
heavy
chairs
not
easily
lifted
obsolete
tables
with
and
dusty
baize
covers

thick
and
dingy
muffles
the
floor
where
he
sits
attended
by
two
candles
in
silver
candlesticks
that
give
a
very
insufficient
light
to
his
large
room
the
titles
on
the
backs
of
his
books

retired
into
the
binding
everything
that
can
have
a
lock
has
got
one
no
key
is
visible
very
few
loose
papers
are
about
he
has
some
manuscript
near
him
but
is
not
referring
to
it
with
the
round
top
of
an
inkstand
and
two
broken
bits
of
he
is
silently
and
slowly
working
out
whatever
train
of
indecision
is
in
his
mind

now

the
black
bit

not

tulkinghorn
must
gather
them
all
up
and
begin
again
here
beneath
the
painted
ceiling
with
foreshortened
allegory
staring
down
at
his
intrusion
as
if
it
meant
to
swoop
upon
him
and
he
cutting
it
dead
tulkinghorn
has
at
once
his
house
and
office
he
keeps
no
staff
only
one
man
usually
a
little
out
at
elbows
who
sits
in
a
high
pew
in
the
hall
and
is
rarely
overburdened
with
business
tulkinghorn
is
not
in
a
common
way
he
wants
no
clerks
he
is
a
great
reservoir
of
confidences
not
to
be
so
tapped
his
clients
want
him
he
is
all
in
all
drafts
that
he
requires
to
be
drawn
are
drawn
by
in
the
temple
on
mysterious
instructions
fair
copies
that
he
requires
to
be
made
are
made
at
the
stationers
expense
being
no
consideration
the
man
in
the
pew
knows
scarcely
more
of
the
affairs
of
the
peerage
than
any
in
holborn

tulkinghorn

puts

puts

tulkinghorn
goes
as
the
crow
came
not
quite
so
straight
but
nearly
to
cook
court
cursitor
street
to
snagsby
deeds
engrossed
and
copied
executed
in
all
its
branches
it
is
somewhere
about
five
or
six
in
the
afternoon
and
a
balmy
fragrance
of
warm
tea
hovers
in
cook
court
it
hovers
about
snagsby
door
the
hours
are
early
there
dinner
at
one
and
supper
at
nine
snagsby
was
about
to
descend
into
the
subterranean
regions
to
take
tea
when
he
looked
out
of
his
door
just
now
and
saw
the
crow
who
was
out
late
master
at
home
guster
is
minding
the
shop
for
the
take
tea
in
the
kitchen
with
and
snagsby
consequently
the
two
daughters
combing
their
curls
at
the
two
glasses
in
the
two
windows
of
the
opposite
house
are
not
driving
the
two
to
distraction
as
they
fondly
suppose
but
are
merely
awakening
the
unprofitable
admiration
of
guster
whose
hair
grow
and
never
would
and
it
is
confidently
thought
never
will
master
at
home
says
tulkinghorn
master
is
at
home
and
guster
will
fetch
him
guster
disappears
glad
to
get
out
of
the
shop
which
she
regards
with
mingled
dread
and
veneration
as
a
storehouse
of
awful
implements
of
the
great
torture
of
the
law
a
place
not
to
be
entered
after
the
gas
is
turned
off
snagsby
appears
greasy
warm
herbaceous
and
chewing
bolts
a
bit
of
bread
and
butter
says
bless
my
soul
sir
mr
tulkinghorn
i
want
half
a
word
with
you
snagsby

sir
dear
me
sir
why

you
send
your
young
man
round
for
me
pray
walk
into
the
back
shop
sir
snagsby
has
brightened
in
a
moment
the
confined
room
strong
of
is
warehouse
and
tulkinghorn
sits
facing
round
on
a
stool
at
the
desk
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
snagsby
yes
sir
snagsby
turns
up
the
gas
and
coughs
behind
his
hand
modestly
anticipating
profit
snagsby
as
a
timid
man
is
accustomed
to
cough
with
a
variety
of
expressions
and
so
to
save
words
you
copied
some
affidavits
in
that
cause
for
me
lately
yes
sir
we
did
there
was
one
of
them
says
tulkinghorn
carelessly
feeling
tight
unopenable
oyster
of
the
old
school
in
the
wrong
the
handwriting
of
which
is
peculiar
and
i
rather
like
as
i
happened
to
be
passing
and
thought
i
had
it
about
me
i
looked
in
to
ask
you
but
i
have
got
it

in
to
ask
you
who

who
copied
this
sir
says
snagsby
taking
it
laying
it
flat
on
the
desk
and
separating
all
the
sheets
at
once
with
a
twirl
and
a
twist
of
the
left
hand
peculiar
to
lawstationers
we
gave
this
out
sir
we
were
giving
out
rather
a
large
quantity
of
work
just
at
that
time
i
can
tell
you
in
a
moment
who
copied
it
sir
by
referring
to
my
book
snagsby
takes
his
book
down
from
the
safe
makes
another
bolt
of
the
bit
of
bread
and
butter
which
seemed
to
have
stopped
short
eyes
the
affidavit
aside
and
brings
his
right
forefinger
travelling
down
a
page
of
the
book
jewby
packer
jarndyce
jarndyce
here
we
are
sir
says
snagsby
to
be
sure
i
might
have
remembered

given
out
sir
to
a
writer
who
lodges
just
over
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lane
tulkinghorn
has
seen
the
entry
found
it
before
the
read
it
while
the
forefinger

coming
down
the
hill

call
him
nemo

tulkinghorn
nemo

eight
brought
in
on
the
thursday
morning
at
half
after
nine
nemo
repeats
tulkinghorn
nemo
is
latin
for
no
one
it
must
be
english
for
some
one
sir
i
think
snagsby
submits
with
his
deferential
cough
it
is
a
person
name
here
it
is
you
see
sir
folio
given
out
wednesday
night
eight
brought
in
thursday
morning
half
after
nine
the
tail
of
snagsby
eye
becomes
conscious
of
the
head
of
snagsby
looking
in
at
the
to
know
what
he
means
by
deserting
his
tea
snagsby
addresses
an
explanatory
cough
to
snagsby
as
who
should
say
my
dear
a
customer
half
after
nine
sir
repeats
snagsby
our
who
live
by
are
a
queer
lot
and
this
may
not
be
his
name
but
it
the
name
he
goes
by
i
remember
now
sir
that
he
gives
it
in
a
written
advertisement
he
sticks
up
down
at
the
rule
office
and
the
king
bench
office
and
the
judges
chambers
and
so
forth
you
know
the
kind
of
document
sir
wanting
employ
tulkinghorn
glances
through
the
little
window
at
the
back
of
coavinses
the
sheriff
officer
where
lights
shine
in
windows
coavinses
is
at
the
back
and
the
shadows
of
several
gentlemen
under
a
cloud
loom
cloudily
upon
the
blinds
snagsby
takes
the
opportunity
of
slightly
turning
his
head
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
his
little
woman
and
to
make
apologetic
motions
with
his
mouth
to
this
effect
rich
have
you
given
this
man
work
before
asks
tulkinghorn
oh
dear
yes
sir
work
of
yours
thinking
of
more
important
matters
i
forget
where
you
said
he
lived
across
the
lane
sir
in
fact
he
lodges
at
a
snagsby
makes
another
bolt
as
if
the
bit
of
bread
and
butter
were
insurmountable
at
a
rag
and
bottle
shop
can
you
show
me
the
place
as
i
go
back
with
the
greatest
pleasure
sir
snagsby
pulls
off
his
sleeves
and
his
grey
coat
pulls
on
his
black
coat
takes
his
hat
from
its
peg
oh
here
is
my
little
woman
he
says
aloud
my
dear
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
one
of
the
lads
to
look
after
the
shop
while
i
step
across
the
lane
with
tulkinghorn
snagsby
sir
i
sha
be
two
minutes
my
love
snagsby
bends
to
the
lawyer
retires
behind
the
counter
peeps
at
them
through
the
goes
softly
into
the
back
office
refers
to
the
entries
in
the
book
still
lying
open
is
evidently
curious
you
will
find
that
the
place
is
rough
sir
says
snagsby
walking
deferentially
in
the
road
and
leaving
the
narrow
pavement
to
the
lawyer
and
the
party
is
very
rough
but
they
a
wild
lot
in
general
sir
the
advantage
of
this
particular
man
is
that
he
never
wants
sleep
he
go
at
it
right
on
end
if
you
want
him
to
as
long
as
ever
you
like
it
is
quite
dark
now
and
the
have
acquired
their
full
effect
jostling
against
clerks
going
to
post
the
day
letters
and
against
counsel
and
attorneys
going
home
to
dinner
and
against
plaintiffs
and
defendants
and
suitors
of
all
sorts
and
against
the
general
crowd
in
whose
way
the
forensic
wisdom
of
ages
has
interposed
a
million
of
obstacles
to
the
transaction
of
the
commonest
business
of
life
diving
through
law
and
equity
and
through
that
kindred
mystery
the
street
mud
which
is
made
of
nobody
knows
what
and
collects
about
us
nobody
knows
whence
or
how
we
only
knowing
in
general
that
when
there
is
too
much
of
it
we
find
it
necessary
to
shovel
it
away
the
lawyer
and
the
come
to
a
rag
and
bottle
shop
and
general
emporium
of
much
disregarded
merchandise
lying
and
being
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
of
lincoln
inn
and
kept
as
is
announced
in
paint
to
all
whom
it
may
concern
by
one
krook
this
is
where
he
lives
sir
says
the
this
is
where
he
lives
is
it
says
the
lawyer
unconcernedly
thank
you
are
you
not
going
in
sir
no
thank
you
no
i
am
going
on
to
the
fields
at
present
good
evening
thank
you
snagsby
lifts
his
hat
and
returns
to
his
little
woman
and
his
tea
but
tulkinghorn
does
not
go
on
to
the
fields
at
present
he
goes
a
short
way
turns
back
comes
again
to
the
shop
of
krook
and
enters
it
straight
it
is
dim
enough
with
a
candle
or
so
in
the
windows
and
an
old
man
and
a
cat
sitting
in
the
back
part
by
a
fire
the
old
man
rises
and
comes
forward
with
another
candle
in
his
hand
pray
is
your
lodger
within
male
or
female
sir
says
krook
male
the
person
who
does
copying
krook
has
eyed
his
man
narrowly
knows
him
by
sight
has
an
indistinct
impression
of
his
aristocratic
repute
did
you
wish
to
see
him
sir
yes
it
what
i
seldom
do
myself
says
krook
with
a
grin
shall
i
call
him
down
but
it
a
weak
chance
if
he
come
sir
i
go
up
to
him
then
says
tulkinghorn
second
floor
sir
take
the
candle
up
there
krook
with
his
cat
beside
him
stands
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
looking
after
tulkinghorn
he
says
when
tulkinghorn
has
nearly
disappeared
the
lawyer
looks
down
over
the
the
cat
expands
her
wicked
mouth
and
snarls
at
him
order
lady
jane
behave
yourself
to
visitors
my
lady
you
know
what
they
say
of
my
lodger
whispers
krook
going
up
a
step
or
two
what
do
they
say
of
him
they
say
he
has
sold
himself
to
the
enemy
but
you
and
i
know
better
he
do
buy
i
tell
you
what
though
my
lodger
is
so
and
gloomy
that
i
believe
he
as
soon
make
that
bargain
as
any
other
do
put
him
out
sir
that
my
advice
tulkinghorn
with
a
nod
goes
on
his
way
he
comes
to
the
dark
door
on
the
second
floor
he
knocks
receives
no
answer
opens
it
and
accidentally
extinguishes
his
candle
in
doing
so
the
air
of
the
room
is
almost
bad
enough
to
have
extinguished
it
if
he
had
not
it
is
a
small
room
nearly
black
with
soot
and
grease
and
dirt
in
the
rusty
skeleton
of
a
grate
pinched
at
the
middle
as
if
poverty
had
gripped
it
a
red
coke
fire
burns
low
in
the
corner
by
the
chimney
stand
a
deal
table
and
a
broken
desk
a
wilderness
marked
with
a
rain
of
ink
in
another
corner
a
ragged
old
portmanteau
on
one
of
the
two
chairs
serves
for
cabinet
or
wardrobe
no
larger
one
is
needed
for
it
collapses
like
the
cheeks
of
a
starved
man
the
floor
is
bare
except
that
one
old
mat
trodden
to
shreds
of
lies
perishing
upon
the
hearth
no
curtain
veils
the
darkness
of
the
night
but
the
discoloured
shutters
are
drawn
together
and
through
the
two
gaunt
holes
pierced
in
them
famine
might
be
staring
in
the
banshee
of
the
man
upon
the
bed
for
on
a
low
bed
opposite
the
fire
a
confusion
of
dirty
patchwork
ticking
and
coarse
sacking
the
lawyer
hesitating
just
within
the
doorway
sees
a
man
he
lies
there
dressed
in
shirt
and
trousers
with
bare
feet
he
has
a
yellow
look
in
the
spectral
darkness
of
a
candle
that
has
guttered
down
until
the
whole
length
of
its
wick
still
burning
has
doubled
over
and
left
a
tower
of
above
it
his
hair
is
ragged
mingling
with
his
whiskers
and
his
beard
the
latter
ragged
too
and
grown
like
the
scum
and
mist
around
him
in
neglect
foul
and
filthy
as
the
room
is
foul
and
filthy
as
the
air
is
it
is
not
easy
to
perceive
what
fumes
those
are
which
most
oppress
the
senses
in
it
but
through
the
general
sickliness
and
faintness
and
the
odour
of
stale
tobacco
there
comes
into
the
lawyer
mouth
the
bitter
vapid
taste
of
opium
hallo
my
friend
he
cries
and
strikes
his
iron
candlestick
against
the
door
he
thinks
he
has
awakened
his
friend
he
lies
a
little
turned
away
but
his
eyes
are
surely
open
hallo
my
friend
he
cries
again
hallo
hallo
as
he
rattles
on
the
door
the
candle
which
has
drooped
so
long
goes
out
and
leaves
him
in
the
dark
with
the
gaunt
eyes
in
the
shutters
staring
down
upon
the
bed
chapter
xi
our
dear
brother
a
touch
on
the
lawyer
wrinkled
hand
as
he
stands
in
the
dark
room
irresolute
makes
him
start
and
say
what
that
it
me
returns
the
old
man
of
the
house
whose
breath
is
in
his
ear
ca
you
wake
him
no
what
have
you
done
with
your
candle
it
gone
out
here
it
is
krook
takes
it
goes
to
the
fire
stoops
over
the
red
embers
and
tries
to
get
a
light
the
dying
ashes
have
no
light
to
spare
and
his
endeavours
are
vain
muttering
after
an
ineffectual
call
to
his
lodger
that
he
will
go
downstairs
and
bring
a
lighted
candle
from
the
shop
the
old
man
departs
tulkinghorn
for
some
new
reason
that
he
has
does
not
await
his
return
in
the
room
but
on
the
stairs
outside
the
welcome
light
soon
shines
upon
the
wall
as
krook
comes
slowly
up
with
his
cat
following
at
his
heels
does
the
man
generally
sleep
like
this
inquired
the
lawyer
in
a
low
voice
hi
i
do
know
says
krook
shaking
his
head
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
i
know
next
to
nothing
of
his
habits
except
that
he
keeps
himself
very
close
thus
whispering
they
both
go
in
together
as
the
light
goes
in
the
great
eyes
in
the
shutters
darkening
seem
to
close
not
so
the
eyes
upon
the
bed
god
save
us
exclaims
tulkinghorn
he
is
dead
krook
drops
the
heavy
hand
he
has
taken
up
so
suddenly
that
the
arm
swings
over
the
bedside
they
look
at
one
another
for
a
moment
send
for
some
doctor
call
for
miss
flite
up
the
stairs
sir
poison
by
the
bed
call
out
for
flite
will
you
says
krook
with
his
lean
hands
spread
out
above
the
body
like
a
vampire
wings
tulkinghorn
hurries
to
the
landing
and
calls
miss
flite
flite
make
haste
here
whoever
you
are
flite
krook
follows
him
with
his
eyes
and
while
he
is
calling
finds
opportunity
to
steal
to
the
old
portmanteau
and
steal
back
again
run
flite
run
the
nearest
doctor
run
so
krook
addresses
a
crazy
little
woman
who
is
his
female
lodger
who
appears
and
vanishes
in
a
breath
who
soon
returns
accompanied
by
a
testy
medical
man
brought
from
his
dinner
with
a
broad
snuffy
upper
lip
and
a
broad
scotch
tongue
ey
bless
the
hearts
o
ye
says
the
medical
man
looking
up
at
them
after
a
moment
examination
he
just
as
dead
as
phairy
tulkinghorn
standing
by
the
old
portmanteau
inquires
if
he
has
been
dead
any
time
any
time
sir
says
the
medical
gentleman
it
probable
he
wull
have
been
dead
aboot
three
hours
about
that
time
i
should
say
observes
a
dark
young
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
air
you
in
the
maydickle
prayfession
yourself
sir
inquires
the
first
the
dark
young
man
says
yes
then
i
just
tak
my
depairture
replies
the
other
for
i
nae
gude
here
with
which
remark
he
finishes
his
brief
attendance
and
returns
to
finish
his
dinner
the
dark
young
surgeon
passes
the
candle
across
and
across
the
face
and
carefully
examines
the
who
has
established
his
pretensions
to
his
name
by
becoming
indeed
no
one
i
knew
this
person
by
sight
very
well
says
he
he
has
purchased
opium
of
me
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
was
anybody
present
related
to
him
glancing
round
upon
the
three
bystanders
i
was
his
landlord
grimly
answers
krook
taking
the
candle
from
the
surgeon
outstretched
hand
he
told
me
once
i
was
the
nearest
relation
he
had
he
has
died
says
the
surgeon
of
an
of
opium
there
is
no
doubt
the
room
is
strongly
flavoured
with
it
there
is
enough
here
now
taking
an
old
from
krook
to
kill
a
dozen
people
do
you
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
asks
krook
took
the
yes
krook
almost
smacks
his
lips
with
the
unction
of
a
horrible
interest
i
ca
say
i
should
think
it
unlikely
as
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
so
much
but
nobody
can
tell
he
was
very
poor
i
suppose
i
suppose
he
was
his
room
do
look
rich
says
krook
who
might
have
changed
eyes
with
his
cat
as
he
casts
his
sharp
glance
around
but
i
have
never
been
in
it
since
he
had
it
and
he
was
too
close
to
name
his
circumstances
to
me
did
he
owe
you
any
rent
six
weeks
he
will
never
pay
it
says
the
young
man
resuming
his
examination
it
is
beyond
a
doubt
that
he
is
indeed
as
dead
as
pharaoh
and
to
judge
from
his
appearance
and
condition
i
should
think
it
a
happy
release
yet
he
must
have
been
a
good
figure
when
a
youth
and
i
dare
say
he
says
this
not
unfeelingly
while
sitting
on
the
bedstead
edge
with
his
face
towards
that
other
face
and
his
hand
upon
the
region
of
the
heart
i
recollect
once
thinking
there
was
something
in
his
manner
uncouth
as
it
was
that
denoted
a
fall
in
life
was
that
so
he
continues
looking
round
krook
replies
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
describe
the
ladies
whose
heads
of
hair
i
have
got
in
sacks
downstairs
than
that
he
was
my
lodger
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
lived
or
did
live
by
i
know
no
more
of
him
during
this
dialogue
tulkinghorn
has
stood
aloof
by
the
old
portmanteau
with
his
hands
behind
him
equally
removed
to
all
appearance
from
all
three
kinds
of
interest
exhibited
near
the
bed
from
the
young
surgeon
professional
interest
in
death
noticeable
as
being
quite
apart
from
his
remarks
on
the
deceased
as
an
individual
from
the
old
man
unction
and
the
little
crazy
woman
awe
his
imperturbable
face
has
been
as
inexpressive
as
his
rusty
clothes
one
could
not
even
say
he
has
been
thinking
all
this
while
he
has
shown
neither
patience
nor
impatience
nor
attention
nor
abstraction
he
has
shown
nothing
but
his
shell
as
easily
might
the
tone
of
a
delicate
musical
instrument
be
inferred
from
its
case
as
the
tone
of
tulkinghorn
from
his
case
he
now
interposes
addressing
the
young
surgeon
in
his
unmoved
professional
way
i
looked
in
here
he
observes
just
before
you
with
the
intention
of
giving
this
deceased
man
whom
i
never
saw
alive
some
employment
at
his
trade
of
copying
i
had
heard
of
him
from
my
stationer
snagsby
of
cook
court
since
no
one
here
knows
anything
about
him
it
might
be
as
well
to
send
for
snagsby
ah
to
the
little
crazy
woman
who
has
often
seen
him
in
court
and
whom
he
has
often
seen
and
who
proposes
in
frightened
to
go
for
the
suppose
you
do
while
she
is
gone
the
surgeon
abandons
his
hopeless
investigation
and
covers
its
subject
with
the
patchwork
counterpane
krook
and
he
interchange
a
word
or
two
tulkinghorn
says
nothing
but
stands
ever
near
the
old
portmanteau
snagsby
arrives
hastily
in
his
grey
coat
and
his
black
sleeves
dear
me
dear
me
he
says
and
it
has
come
to
this
has
it
bless
my
soul
can
you
give
the
person
of
the
house
any
information
about
this
unfortunate
creature
snagsby
inquires
tulkinghorn
he
was
in
arrears
with
his
rent
it
seems
and
he
must
be
buried
you
know
well
sir
says
snagsby
coughing
his
apologetic
cough
behind
his
hand
i
really
do
know
what
advice
i
could
offer
except
sending
for
the
beadle
i
do
speak
of
advice
returns
tulkinghorn
i
could
advise
no
one
better
sir
i
am
sure
says
snagsby
with
his
deferential
cough
i
speak
of
affording
some
clue
to
his
connexions
or
to
where
he
came
from
or
to
anything
concerning
him
i
assure
you
sir
says
snagsby
after
prefacing
his
reply
with
his
cough
of
general
propitiation
that
i
no
more
know
where
he
came
from
than
i
know
where
he
has
gone
to
perhaps
suggests
the
surgeon
to
help
him
out
a
pause
tulkinghorn
looking
at
the
krook
with
his
mouth
open
looking
for
somebody
to
speak
next
as
to
his
connexions
sir
says
snagsby
if
a
person
was
to
say
to
me
here
twenty
thousand
pound
down
ready
for
you
in
the
bank
of
england
if
you
only
name
one
of
i
could
do
it
sir
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
to
the
best
of
my
belief
at
the
time
when
he
first
came
to
lodge
at
the
present
rag
and
bottle
shop
that
was
the
time
says
krook
with
a
nod
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
says
snagsby
strengthened
he
came
into
our
place
one
morning
after
breakfast
and
finding
my
little
woman
which
i
name
snagsby
when
i
use
that
appellation
in
our
shop
produced
a
specimen
of
his
handwriting
and
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
was
in
want
of
copying
work
to
do
and
was
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
a
favourite
apology
for
plain
speaking
with
snagsby
which
he
always
offers
with
a
sort
of
argumentative
frankness
hard
up
my
little
woman
is
not
in
general
partial
to
strangers
particular
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
when
they
want
anything
but
she
was
rather
took
by
something
about
this
person
whether
by
his
being
unshaved
or
by
his
hair
being
in
want
of
attention
or
by
what
other
ladies
reasons
i
leave
you
to
judge
and
she
accepted
of
the
specimen
and
likewise
of
the
address
my
little
woman
has
a
good
ear
for
names
proceeds
snagsby
after
consulting
his
cough
of
consideration
behind
his
hand
and
she
considered
nemo
equally
the
same
as
nimrod
in
consequence
of
which
she
got
into
a
habit
of
saying
to
me
at
meals
snagsby
you
have
found
nimrod
any
work
yet
or
snagsby
why
did
you
give
that
eight
and
thirty
chancery
folio
in
jarndyce
to
nimrod
or
such
like
and
that
is
the
way
he
gradually
fell
into
at
our
place
and
that
is
the
most
i
know
of
him
except
that
he
was
a
quick
hand
and
a
hand
not
sparing
of
and
that
if
you
gave
him
out
say
five
and
forty
folio
on
the
wednesday
night
you
would
have
it
brought
in
on
the
thursday
morning
all
of
which
snagsby
concludes
by
politely
motioning
with
his
hat
towards
the
bed
as
much
as
to
add
i
have
no
doubt
my
honourable
friend
would
confirm
if
he
were
in
a
condition
to
do
it
had
you
better
see
says
tulkinghorn
to
krook
whether
he
had
any
papers
that
may
enlighten
you
there
will
be
an
inquest
and
you
will
be
asked
the
question
you
can
read
no
i
ca
returns
the
old
man
with
a
sudden
grin
snagsby
says
tulkinghorn
look
over
the
room
for
him
he
will
get
into
some
trouble
or
difficulty
otherwise
being
here
i
wait
if
you
make
haste
and
then
i
can
testify
on
his
behalf
if
it
should
ever
be
necessary
that
all
was
fair
and
right
if
you
will
hold
the
candle
for
snagsby
my
friend
he
soon
see
whether
there
is
anything
to
help
you
in
the
first
place
here
an
old
portmanteau
sir
says
snagsby
ah
to
be
sure
so
there
is
tulkinghorn
does
not
appear
to
have
seen
it
before
though
he
is
standing
so
close
to
it
and
though
there
is
very
little
else
heaven
knows
the
merchant
holds
the
light
and
the
conducts
the
search
the
surgeon
leans
against
the
corner
of
the
miss
flite
peeps
and
trembles
just
within
the
door
the
apt
old
scholar
of
the
old
school
with
his
dull
black
breeches
tied
with
ribbons
at
the
knees
his
large
black
waistcoat
his
black
coat
and
his
wisp
of
limp
white
neckerchief
tied
in
the
bow
the
peerage
knows
so
well
stands
in
exactly
the
same
place
and
attitude
there
are
some
worthless
articles
of
clothing
in
the
old
portmanteau
there
is
a
bundle
of
pawnbrokers
duplicates
those
turnpike
tickets
on
the
road
of
poverty
there
is
a
crumpled
paper
smelling
of
opium
on
which
are
scrawled
rough
memoranda
as
took
such
a
day
so
many
grains
took
such
another
day
so
many
more
begun
some
time
ago
as
if
with
the
intention
of
being
regularly
continued
but
soon
left
off
there
are
a
few
dirty
scraps
of
newspapers
all
referring
to
coroners
inquests
there
is
nothing
else
they
search
the
cupboard
and
the
drawer
of
the
table
there
is
not
a
morsel
of
an
old
letter
or
of
any
other
writing
in
either
the
young
surgeon
examines
the
dress
on
the
a
knife
and
some
odd
halfpence
are
all
he
finds
snagsby
suggestion
is
the
practical
suggestion
after
all
and
the
beadle
must
be
called
in
so
the
little
crazy
lodger
goes
for
the
beadle
and
the
rest
come
out
of
the
room
do
leave
the
cat
there
says
the
surgeon
that
wo
do
krook
therefore
drives
her
out
before
him
and
she
goes
furtively
downstairs
winding
her
lithe
tail
and
licking
her
lips
good
night
says
tulkinghorn
and
goes
home
to
allegory
and
meditation
by
this
time
the
news
has
got
into
the
court
groups
of
its
inhabitants
assemble
to
discuss
the
thing
and
the
outposts
of
the
army
of
observation
principally
boys
are
pushed
forward
to
krook
window
which
they
closely
invest
a
policeman
has
already
walked
up
to
the
room
and
walked
down
again
to
the
door
where
he
stands
like
a
tower
only
condescending
to
see
the
boys
at
his
base
occasionally
but
whenever
he
does
see
them
they
quail
and
fall
back
perkins
who
has
not
been
for
some
weeks
on
speaking
terms
with
piper
in
consequence
for
an
unpleasantness
originating
in
young
perkins
having
fetched
young
piper
a
crack
renews
her
friendly
intercourse
on
this
auspicious
occasion
the
potboy
at
the
corner
who
is
a
privileged
amateur
as
possessing
official
knowledge
of
life
and
having
to
deal
with
drunken
men
occasionally
exchanges
confidential
communications
with
the
policeman
and
has
the
appearance
of
an
impregnable
youth
unassailable
by
truncheons
and
unconfinable
in
people
talk
across
the
court
out
of
window
and
scouts
come
hurrying
in
from
chancery
lane
to
know
the
matter
the
general
feeling
seems
to
be
that
it
a
blessing
krook
war
made
away
with
first
mingled
with
a
little
natural
disappointment
that
he
was
not
in
the
midst
of
this
sensation
the
beadle
arrives
the
beadle
though
generally
understood
in
the
neighbourhood
to
be
a
ridiculous
institution
is
not
without
a
certain
popularity
for
the
moment
if
it
were
only
as
a
man
who
is
going
to
see
the
body
the
policeman
considers
him
an
imbecile
civilian
a
remnant
of
the
barbarous
watchmen
times
but
gives
him
admission
as
something
that
must
be
borne
with
until
government
shall
abolish
him
the
sensation
is
heightened
as
the
tidings
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
the
beadle
is
on
the
ground
and
has
gone
in
by
and
by
the
beadle
comes
out
once
more
intensifying
the
sensation
which
has
rather
languished
in
the
interval
he
is
understood
to
be
in
want
of
witnesses
for
the
inquest
who
can
tell
the
coroner
and
jury
anything
whatever
respecting
the
deceased
is
immediately
referred
to
innumerable
people
who
can
tell
nothing
whatever
is
made
more
imbecile
by
being
constantly
informed
that
green
son
was
a
and
knowed
him
better
than
anybody
which
son
of
green
appears
on
inquiry
to
be
at
the
present
time
aboard
a
vessel
bound
for
china
three
months
out
but
considered
accessible
by
telegraph
on
application
to
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
beadle
goes
into
various
shops
and
parlours
examining
the
inhabitants
always
shutting
the
door
first
and
by
exclusion
delay
and
general
idiotcy
exasperating
the
public
policeman
seen
to
smile
to
potboy
public
loses
interest
and
undergoes
reaction
taunts
the
beadle
in
shrill
youthful
voices
with
having
boiled
a
boy
choruses
fragments
of
a
popular
song
to
that
effect
and
importing
that
the
boy
was
made
into
soup
for
the
workhouse
policeman
at
last
finds
it
necessary
to
support
the
law
and
seize
a
vocalist
who
is
released
upon
the
flight
of
the
rest
on
condition
of
his
getting
out
of
this
then
come
and
cutting
it
a
condition
he
immediately
observes
so
the
sensation
dies
off
for
the
time
and
the
unmoved
policeman
to
whom
a
little
opium
more
or
less
is
nothing
with
his
shining
hat
stiff
stock
inflexible
stout
belt
and
bracelet
and
all
things
fitting
pursues
his
lounging
way
with
a
heavy
tread
beating
the
palms
of
his
white
gloves
one
against
the
other
and
stopping
now
and
then
at
a
to
look
casually
about
for
anything
between
a
lost
child
and
a
murder
under
cover
of
the
night
the
beadle
comes
flitting
about
chancery
lane
with
his
summonses
in
which
every
juror
name
is
wrongly
spelt
and
nothing
rightly
spelt
but
the
beadle
own
name
which
nobody
can
read
or
wants
to
know
the
summonses
served
and
his
witnesses
forewarned
the
beadle
goes
to
krook
to
keep
a
small
appointment
he
has
made
with
certain
paupers
who
presently
arriving
are
conducted
upstairs
where
they
leave
the
great
eyes
in
the
shutter
something
new
to
stare
at
in
that
last
shape
which
earthly
lodgings
take
for
no
one
and
for
every
one
and
all
that
night
the
coffin
stands
ready
by
the
old
portmanteau
and
the
lonely
figure
on
the
bed
whose
path
in
life
has
lain
through
five
and
forty
years
lies
there
with
no
more
track
behind
him
that
any
one
can
trace
than
a
deserted
infant
next
day
the
court
is
all
alive
is
like
a
fair
as
perkins
more
than
reconciled
to
piper
says
in
amicable
conversation
with
that
excellent
woman
the
coroner
is
to
sit
in
the
room
at
the
sol
arms
where
the
harmonic
meetings
take
place
twice
a
week
and
where
the
chair
is
filled
by
a
gentleman
of
professional
celebrity
faced
by
little
swills
the
comic
vocalist
who
hopes
according
to
the
bill
in
the
window
that
his
friends
will
rally
round
him
and
support
talent
the
sol
arms
does
a
brisk
stroke
of
business
all
the
morning
even
children
so
require
sustaining
under
the
general
excitement
that
a
pieman
who
has
established
himself
for
the
occasion
at
the
corner
of
the
court
says
his
go
off
like
smoke
what
time
the
beadle
hovering
between
the
door
of
krook
establishment
and
the
door
of
the
sol
arms
shows
the
curiosity
in
his
keeping
to
a
few
discreet
spirits
and
accepts
the
compliment
of
a
glass
of
ale
or
so
in
return
at
the
appointed
hour
arrives
the
coroner
for
whom
the
jurymen
are
waiting
and
who
is
received
with
a
salute
of
skittles
from
the
good
dry
attached
to
the
sol
arms
the
coroner
frequents
more
than
any
man
alive
the
smell
of
sawdust
beer
and
spirits
is
inseparable
in
his
vocation
from
death
in
its
most
awful
shapes
he
is
conducted
by
the
beadle
and
the
landlord
to
the
harmonic
meeting
room
where
he
puts
his
hat
on
the
piano
and
takes
a
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
formed
of
several
short
tables
put
together
and
ornamented
with
glutinous
rings
in
endless
involutions
made
by
pots
and
glasses
as
many
of
the
jury
as
can
crowd
together
at
the
table
sit
there
the
rest
get
among
the
spittoons
and
pipes
or
lean
against
the
piano
over
the
head
is
a

which
rather
gives
the
majesty
of

appearance
of
going
to
be
hanged
presently
call
over
and
swear
the
jury
while
the
ceremony
is
in
progress
sensation
is
created
by
the
entrance
of
a
chubby
little
man
in
a
large
with
a
moist
eye
and
an
inflamed
nose
who
modestly
takes
a
position
near
the
door
as
one
of
the
general
public
but
seems
familiar
with
the
room
too
a
whisper
circulates
that
this
is
little
swills
it
is
considered
not
unlikely
that
he
will
get
up
an
imitation
of
the
coroner
and
make
it
the
principal
feature
of
the
harmonic
meeting
in
the
evening
well
gentlemen
the
coroner
begins
silence
there
will
you
says
the
beadle
not
to
the
coroner
though
it
might
appear
so
well
gentlemen
resumes
the
coroner
you
are
impanelled
here
to
inquire
into
the
death
of
a
certain
man
evidence
will
be
given
before
you
as
to
the
circumstances
attending
that
death
and
you
will
give
your
verdict
according
to
the
skittles
they
must
be
stopped
you
know
beadle
evidence
and
not
according
to
anything
else
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
view
the
body
make
way
there
cries
the
beadle
so
they
go
out
in
a
loose
procession
something
after
the
manner
of
a
straggling
funeral
and
make
their
inspection
in
krook
back
second
floor
from
which
a
few
of
the
jurymen
retire
pale
and
precipitately
the
beadle
is
very
careful
that
two
gentlemen
not
very
neat
about
the
cuffs
and
buttons
for
whose
accommodation
he
has
provided
a
special
little
table
near
the
coroner
in
the
harmonic
meeting
room
should
see
all
that
is
to
be
seen
for
they
are
the
public
chroniclers
of
such
inquiries
by
the
line
and
he
is
not
superior
to
the
universal
human
infirmity
but
hopes
to
read
in
print
what
mooney
the
active
and
intelligent
beadle
of
the
district
said
and
did
and
even
aspires
to
see
the
name
of
mooney
as
familiarly
and
patronizingly
mentioned
as
the
name
of
the
hangman
is
according
to
the
latest
examples

gentlemen
says
the
coroner
who
i
am
informed
was
accidentally
present
when
discovery
of
the
death
was
made
but
he
could
only
repeat

evidence

unknown
proved
to

been
in
the
habit
of
taking
opium
in
large
quantities
for
a
year
and
a
half
found
dead
of
too
much
opium
if
you
think
you
have
any
evidence
to
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
he
committed
suicide
you
will
come
to
that
conclusion
if
you

it
is
a
case
of
accidental
death
you
will
find
a
verdict
accordingly
verdict

accidental

no

gentlemen
you
are
discharged
good
afternoon
while
the
coroner
buttons
his
tulkinghorn
and
he
give
private
audience
to
the
rejected
witness
in
a
corner
that
graceless
creature
only
knows
that
the
dead
man
whom
he
recognized
just
now
by
his
yellow
face
and
black
hair
was
sometimes
hooted
and
pursued
about
the
streets
that
one
cold
winter
night
when
he
the
boy
was
shivering
in
a
doorway
near
his
crossing
the
man
turned
to
look
at
him
and
came
back
and
having
questioned
him
and
found
that
he
had
not
a
friend
in
the
world
said
neither
have
i
not
one
and
gave
him
the
price
of
a
supper
and
a
night
lodging
that
the
man
had
often
spoken
to
him
since
and
asked
him
whether
he
slept
sound
at
night
and
how
he
bore
cold
and
hunger
and
whether
he
ever
wished
to
die
and
similar
strange
questions
that
when
the
man
had
no
money
he
would
say
in
passing
i
am
as
poor
as
you
jo
but
that
when
he
had
any
he
had
always
as
the
boy
most
heartily
believes
been
glad
to
give
him
some
he
was
wery
good
to
me
says
the
boy
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
wretched
sleeve
wen
i
see
him
so
stritched
out
just
now
i
wished
he
could
have
heerd
me
tell
him
so
he
wos
wery
good
to
me
he
wos
as
he
shuffles
downstairs
snagsby
lying
in
wait
for
him
puts

if
you
ever
see
me
coming
past
your

with
my
little
woman
i
mean
a

says
snagsby
with
his
finger
on
his
nose
do
allude
to
it
for
some
little
time
the
jurymen
hang
about
the
sol

colloquially
in
the
sequel
are
caught
up
in
a
cloud
of

asked
what

of

them
his

lying
in
a

direction
as
a
rummy

the
landlord
of

finding
little

so
popular
commends
him
highly
to
the
jurymen
and
public
observing
that
for
a
song
in
character
he
do
know
his
equal
and
that
that

thus
gradually
the

melts
into
the
shadowy
night
and
then
flares
out
of
it
strong

the
harmonic

says
gentlemen
if
you
permit
me
i
attempt
a
short
description
of
a
scene
of
real
life
that
came
off
here
is
much
applauded
and
encouraged
goes
out
of
the
room
as
swills
comes
in
as
the
coroner
not
the
least
in
the
world
like
him
describes
the
inquest
with
recreative
intervals
of
accompaniment
to
the
refrain

the

at
last
is
silent
and
the
harmonic
friends
rally
round
their
pillows
then
there
is
rest
around
the
lonely
figure
now
laid
in
its
last
earthly
habitation
and
it
is
watched
by
the
gaunt
eyes
in
the
shutters
through
some
quiet
hours
of
night
if
this
forlorn
man
could
have
been
prophetically
seen
lying
here
by
the
mother
at
whose
breast
he
nestled
a
little
child
with
eyes
upraised
to
her
loving
face
and
soft
hand
scarcely
knowing
how
to
close
upon
the
neck
to
which
it
crept
what
an
impossibility
the
vision
would
have
seemed
oh
if
in
brighter
days
the
fire
within
him
ever
burned
for
one
woman
who
held
him
in
her
heart
where
is
she
while
these
ashes
are
above
the
ground
it
is
anything
but
a
night
of
rest
at
snagsby
in
cook
court
where
guster
murders
sleep
by
going
as
snagsby
himself
allows
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
out
of
one
fit
into
twenty
the
occasion
of
this
seizure
is
that
guster
has
a
tender
heart
and
a
susceptible
something
that
possibly
might
have
been
imagination
but
for
tooting
and
her
patron
saint
be
it
what
it
may
now
it
was
so
direfully
impressed
at
by
account
of
the
inquiry
at
which
he
had
assisted
that
at
she
projected
herself
into
the
kitchen
preceded
by
a
flying
dutch
cheese
and
fell
into
a
fit
of
unusual
duration
which
she
only
came
out
of
to
go
into
another
and
another
and
so
on
through
a
chain
of
fits
with
short
intervals
between
of
which
she
has
pathetically
availed
herself
by
consuming
them
in
entreaties
to
snagsby
not
to
give
her
warning
when
she
quite
comes
to
and
also
in
appeals
to
the
whole
establishment
to
lay
her
down
on
the
stones
and
go
to
bed
hence
snagsby
at
last
hearing
the
cock
at
the
little
dairy
in
cursitor
street
go
into
that
disinterested
ecstasy
of
his
on
the
subject
of
daylight
says
drawing
a
long
breath
though
the
most
patient
of
men
i
thought
you
was
dead
i
am
sure
what
question
this
enthusiastic
fowl
supposes
he
settles
when
he
strains
himself
to
such
an
extent
or
why
he
should
thus
crow
so
men
crow
on
various
triumphant
public
occasions
however
about
what
can
not
be
of
any
moment
to
him
is
his
affair
it
is
enough
that
daylight
comes
morning
comes
noon
comes
then
the
active
and
intelligent
who
has
got
into
the
morning
papers
as
such
comes
with
his
pauper
company
to
krook
and
bears
off
the
body
of
our
dear
brother
here
departed
to
a
churchyard
pestiferous
and
obscene
whence
malignant
diseases
are
communicated
to
the
bodies
of
our
dear
brothers
and
sisters
who
have
not
departed
while
our
dear
brothers
and
sisters
who
hang
about
official
would
to
heaven
they
had
departed
are
very
complacent
and
agreeable
into
a
beastly
scrap
of
ground
which
a
turk
would
reject
as
a
savage
abomination
and
a
caffre
would
shudder
at
they
bring
our
dear
brother
here
departed
to
receive
christian
burial
with
houses
looking
on
on
every
side
save
where
a
reeking
little
tunnel
of
a
court
gives
access
to
the
iron
gate

every
villainy
of
life
in
action
close
on
death

every
poisonous
element
of
death
in

here
they
lower
our
dear
brother
down
a
foot
or
two
here
sow
him
in
corruption
to
be
raised
in
corruption

avenging
ghost

shameful
testimony
to
future
ages
how
civilization

barbarism
walked

boastful
island

holds
the

with
its

looks
in

of
brightness
never
contemplated
by
the
painters
athwart
the
picture
of
my
lady
over
the
great
it
throws
a
broad
of
light
that
strikes
down
crookedly
into
the
hearth
and
seems
to
rend
it
through
the
same
cold
sunshine
and
the
same
sharp
wind
my
lady
and
sir
leicester
in
their
travelling
chariot
my
lady
woman
and
sir
leicester
man
affectionate
in
the
rumble
start
for
home
with
a
considerable
amount
of
jingling
and
and
many
plunging
demonstrations
on
the
part
of
two
horses
and
two
centaurs
with
glazed
hats
and
flowing
manes
and
tails
they
rattle
out
of
the
yard
of
the
hotel
bristol
in
the
place
vendome
and
canter
between
the
colonnade
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
the
garden
of
the
palace
of
a
headless
king
and
queen
off
by
the
place
of
concord
and
the
elysian
fields
and
the
gate
of
the
star
out
of
paris
sooth
to
say
they
can
not
go
away
too
fast
for
even
here
my
lady
dedlock
has
been
bored
to
death
concert
assembly
opera
theatre
drive
nothing
is
new
to
my
lady
under
the
heavens
only
last
sunday
when
poor
wretches
were
gay
within
the
walls
playing
with
children
among
the
clipped
trees
and
the
statues
in
the
palace
garden
walking
a
score
abreast
in
the
elysian
fields
made
more
elysian
by
performing
dogs
and
wooden
horses
between
whiles
filtering
a
few
through
the
gloomy
cathedral
of
our
lady
to
say
a
word
or
two
at
the
base
of
a
pillar
within
flare
of
a
rusty
little
of
gusty
little
tapers
without
the
walls
encompassing
paris
with
dancing
billiard
card
and
domino
playing
and
much
murderous
refuse
animate
and
inanimate
only
last
sunday
my
lady
in
the
desolation
of
boredom
and
the
clutch
of
giant
despair
almost
hated
her
own
maid
for
being
in
spirits
she
can
not
therefore
go
too
fast
from
paris
weariness
of
soul
lies
before
her
as
it
lies
behind
her
ariel
has
put
a
girdle
of
it
round
the
whole
earth
and
it
can
not
be
unclasped
but
the
imperfect
remedy
is
always
to
fly
from
the
last
place
where
it
has
been
experienced
fling
paris
back
into
the
distance
then
exchanging
it
for
endless
avenues
and
of
wintry
trees
and
when
next
beheld
let
it
be
some
leagues
away
with
the
gate
of
the
star
a
white
speck
glittering
in
the
sun
and
the
city
a
mere
mound
in
a
plain
two
dark
square
towers
rising
out
of
it
and
light
and
shadow
descending
on
it
aslant
like
the
angels
in
jacob
dream
sir
leicester
is
generally
in
a
complacent
state
and
rarely
bored
when
he
has
nothing
else
to
do
he
can
always
contemplate
his
own
greatness
it
is
a
considerable
advantage
to
a
man
to
have
so
inexhaustible
a
subject
after
reading
his
letters
he
leans
back
in
his
corner
of
the
carriage
and
generally
reviews
his
importance
to
society
you
have
an
unusual
amount
of
correspondence
this
morning
says
my
lady
after
a
long
time
she
is
fatigued
with
reading
has
almost
read
a
page
in
twenty
miles
nothing
in
it
though
nothing
whatever
i
saw
one
of
tulkinghorn
long
effusions
i
think
you
see
everything
says
sir
leicester
with
admiration
ha
sighs
my
lady
he
is
the
most
tiresome
of
men
he
sends
i
really
beg
your
pardon
he
sends
says
sir
leicester
selecting
the
letter
and
unfolding
it
a
message
to
you
our
stopping
to
change
horses
as
i
came
to
his
postscript
drove
it
out
of
my
memory
i
beg
you
excuse
me
he
says
sir
leicester
is
so
long
in
taking
out
his
and
adjusting
it
that
my
lady
looks
a
little
irritated
he
says
the
matter
of
the
right
of
way
i
beg
your
pardon
that
not
the
place
he
says
yes
here
i
have
it
he
says
beg
my
respectful
compliments
to
my
lady
who
i
hope
has
benefited
by
the
change
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
mention
as
it
may
interest
her
that
i
have
something
to
tell
her
on
her
return
in
reference
to
the
person
who
copied
the
affidavit
in
the
chancery
suit
which
so
powerfully
stimulated
her
curiosity
i
have
seen
him
my
lady
leaning
forward
looks
out
of
her
window
that
the
message
observes
sir
leicester
i
should
like
to
walk
a
little
says
my
lady
still
looking
out
of
her
window
walk
repeats
sir
leicester
in
a
tone
of
surprise
i
should
like
to
walk
a
little
says
my
lady
with
unmistakable
distinctness
please
to
stop
the
carriage
the
carriage
is
stopped
the
affectionate
man
alights
from
the
rumble
opens
the
door
and
lets
down
the
steps
obedient
to
an
impatient
motion
of
my
lady
hand
my
lady
alights
so
quickly
and
walks
away
so
quickly
that
sir
leicester
for
all
his
scrupulous
politeness
is
unable
to
assist
her
and
is
left
behind
a
space
of
a
minute
or
two
has
elapsed
before
he
comes
up
with
her
she
smiles
looks
very
handsome
takes
his
arm
lounges
with
him
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
is
very
much
bored
and
resumes
her
seat
in
the
carriage
the
rattle
and
clatter
continue
through
the
greater
part
of
three
days
with
more
or
less
of
and
and
more
or
less
plunging
of
centaurs
and
horses
their
courtly
politeness
to
each
other
at
the
hotels
where
they
tarry
is
the
theme
of
general
admiration
though
my
lord
is
a
little
aged
for
my
lady
says
madame
the
hostess
of
the
golden
ape
and
though
he
might
be
her
amiable
father
one
can
see
at
a
glance
that
they
love
each
other
one
observes
my
lord
with
his
white
hair
standing
hat
in
hand
to
help
my
lady
to
and
from
the
carriage
one
observes
my
lady
how
recognisant
of
my
lord
politeness
with
an
inclination
of
her
gracious
head
and
the
concession
of
her
fingers
it
is
ravishing
the
sea
has
no
appreciation
of
great
men
but
knocks
them
about
like
the
small
fry
it
is
habitually
hard
upon
sir
leicester
whose
countenance
it
greenly
mottles
in
the
manner
of
and
in
whose
aristocratic
system
it
effects
a
dismal
revolution
it
is
the
radical
of
nature
to
him
nevertheless
his
dignity
gets
over
it
after
stopping
to
refit
and
he
goes
on
with
my
lady
for
chesney
wold
lying
only
one
night
in
london
on
the
way
to
lincolnshire
through
the
same
cold
sunlight
colder
as
the
day
declines
and
through
the
same
sharp
wind
sharper
as
the
separate
shadows
of
bare
trees
gloom
together
in
the
woods
and
as
the
ghost
walk
touched
at
the
western
corner
by
a
pile
of
fire
in
the
sky
resigns
itself
to
coming
night
they
drive
into
the
park
the
rooks
swinging
in
their
lofty
houses
in
the
avenue
seem
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
occupancy
of
the
carriage
as
it
passes
underneath
some
agreeing
that
sir
leicester
and
my
lady
are
come
down
some
arguing
with
malcontents
who
wo
admit
it
now
all
consenting
to
consider
the
question
disposed
of
now
all
breaking
out
again
in
violent
debate
incited
by
one
obstinate
and
drowsy
bird
who
will
persist
in
putting
in
a
last
contradictory
croak
leaving
them
to
swing
and
caw
the
travelling
chariot
rolls
on
to
the
house
where
fires
gleam
warmly
through
some
of
the
windows
though
not
through
so
many
as
to
give
an
inhabited
expression
to
the
darkening
mass
of
front
but
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
will
soon
do
that
rouncewell
is
in
attendance
and
receives
sir
customary
shake
of
the
hand
with
a
profound
curtsy
how
do
you
do
rouncewell
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
hope
i
have
the
honour
of
welcoming
you
in
good
health
sir
leicester
in
excellent
health
mrs
rouncewell
my
lady
is
looking
charmingly
well
says
rouncewell
with
another
curtsy
my
lady
signifies
without
profuse
expenditure
of
words
that
she
is
as
wearily
well
as
she
can
hope
to
be
but
rosa
is
in
the
distance
behind
the
housekeeper
and
my
lady
who
has
not
subdued
the
quickness
of
her
observation
whatever
else
she
may
have
conquered
asks
who
is
that
girl
a
young
scholar
of
mine
my
lady
rosa
come
here
rosa
lady
dedlock
beckons
her
with
even
an
appearance
of
interest
why
do
you
know
how
pretty
you
are
child
she
says
touching
her
shoulder
with
her
two
forefingers
rosa
very
much
abashed
says
no
if
you
please
my
lady
and
glances
up
and
glances
down
and
do
know
where
to
look
but
looks
all
the
prettier
how
old
are
you
nineteen
my
lady
nineteen
repeats
my
lady
thoughtfully
take
care
they
do
spoil
you
by
flattery
yes
my
lady
my
lady
taps
her
dimpled
cheek
with
the
same
delicate
gloved
fingers
and
goes
on
to
the
foot
of
the
oak
staircase
where
sir
leicester
pauses
for
her
as
her
knightly
escort
a
staring
old
dedlock
in
a
panel
as
large
as
life
and
as
dull
looks
as
if
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
which
was
probably
his
general
state
of
mind
in
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
that
evening
in
the
housekeeper
room
rosa
can
do
nothing
but
murmur
lady
dedlock
praises
she
is
so
affable
so
graceful
so
beautiful
so
elegant
has
such
a
sweet
voice
and
such
a
thrilling
touch
that
rosa
can
feel
it
yet
rouncewell
confirms
all
this
not
without
personal
pride
reserving
only
the
one
point
of
affability
rouncewell
is
not
quite
sure
as
to
that
heaven
forbid
that
she
should
say
a
syllable
in
dispraise
of
any
member
of
that
excellent
family
above
all
of
my
lady
whom
the
whole
world
admires
but
if
my
lady
would
only
be
a
little
more
free
not
quite
so
cold
and
distant
rouncewell
thinks
she
would
be
more
affable
is
almost
a
pity
rouncewell
adds
only
almost
because
it
borders
on
impiety
to
suppose
that
anything
could
be
better
than
it
is
in
such
an
express
dispensation
as
the
dedlock
affairs
that
my
lady
has
no
family
if
she
had
had
a
daughter
now
a
grown
young
lady
to
interest
her
i
think
she
would
have
had
the
only
kind
of
excellence
she
wants
might
not
that
have
made
her
still
more
proud
grandmother
says
watt
who
has
been
home
and
come
back
again
he
is
such
a
good
grandson
more
and
most
my
dear
returns
the
housekeeper
with
dignity
are
words
it
not
my
place
to
use
nor
so
much
as
to
hear
applied
to
any
drawback
on
my
lady
i
beg
your
pardon
grandmother
but
she
is
proud
is
she
not
if
she
is
she
has
reason
to
be
the
dedlock
family
have
always
reason
to
be
well
says
watt
it
to
be
hoped
they
line
out
of
their
a
certain
passage
for
the
common
people
about
pride
and
vainglory
forgive
me
grandmother
only
a
joke
sir
leicester
and
lady
dedlock
my
dear
are
not
fit
subjects
for
joking
sir
leicester
is
no
joke
by
any
means
says
watt
and
i
humbly
ask
his
pardon
i
suppose
grandmother
that
even
with
the
family
and
their
guests
down
here
there
is
no
objection
to
my
prolonging
my
stay
at
the
dedlock
arms
for
a
day
or
two
as
any
other
traveller
might
surely
none
in
the
world
child
i
am
glad
of
that
says
watt
because
i
have
an
inexpressible
desire
to
extend
my
knowledge
of
this
beautiful
neighbourhood
he
happens
to
glance
at
rosa
who
looks
down
and
is
very
shy
indeed
but
according
to
the
old
superstition
it
should
be
rosa
ears
that
burn
and
not
her
fresh
bright
cheeks
for
my
lady
maid
is
holding
forth
about
her
at
this
moment
with
surpassing
energy
my
lady
maid
is
a
frenchwoman
of
two
and
thirty
from
somewhere
in
the
southern
country
about
avignon
and
marseilles
a
brown
woman
with
black
hair
who
would
be
handsome
but
for
a
certain
feline
mouth
and
general
uncomfortable
tightness
of
face
rendering
the
jaws
too
eager
and
the
skull
too
prominent
there
is
something
indefinably
keen
and
wan
about
her
anatomy
and
she
has
a
watchful
way
of
looking
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
without
turning
her
head
which
could
be
pleasantly
dispensed
with
especially
when
she
is
in
an
ill
humour
and
near
knives
through
all
the
good
taste
of
her
dress
and
little
adornments
these
objections
so
express
themselves
that
she
seems
to
go
about
like
a
very
neat
imperfectly
tamed
besides
being
accomplished
in
all
the
knowledge
appertaining
to
her
post
she
is
almost
an
englishwoman
in
her
acquaintance
with
the
language
consequently
she
is
in
no
want
of
words
to
shower
upon
rosa
for
having
attracted
my
lady
attention
and
she
pours
them
out
with
such
grim
ridicule
as
she
sits
at
dinner
that
her
companion
the
affectionate
man
is
rather
relieved
when
she
arrives
at
the
spoon
stage
of
that
performance
ha
ha
ha
she
hortense
been
in
my
lady
service
since
five
years
and
always
kept
at
the
distance
and
this
doll
this
puppet
caressed
absolutely
caressed
by
my
lady
on
the
moment
of
her
arriving
at
the
house
ha
ha
ha
and
do
you
know
how
pretty
you
are
child
no
my
lady
you
are
right
there
and
how
old
are
you
child
and
take
care
they
do
not
spoil
you
by
flattery
child
oh
how
droll
it
is
the
best
thing
altogether
in
short
it
is
such
an
admirable
thing
that
mademoiselle
hortense
ca
forget
it
but
at
meals
for
days
afterwards
even
among
her
countrywomen
and
others
attached
in
like
capacity
to
the
troop
of
visitors
relapses
into
silent
enjoyment
of
the
joke
an
enjoyment
expressed
in
her
own
convivial
manner
by
an
additional
tightness
of
face
thin
elongation
of
compressed
lips
and
sidewise
look
which
intense
appreciation
of
humour
is
frequently
reflected
in
my
mirrors
when
my
lady
is
not
among
them
all
the
mirrors
in
the
house
are
brought
into
action
now
many
of
them
after
a
long
blank
they
reflect
handsome
faces
simpering
faces
youthful
faces
faces
of
threescore
and
ten
that
will
not
submit
to
be
old
the
entire
collection
of
faces
that
have
come
to
pass
a
january
week
or
two
at
chesney
wold
and
which
the
fashionable
intelligence
a
mighty
hunter
before
the
lord
hunts
with
a
keen
scent
from
their
breaking
cover
at
the
court
of
james
to
their
being
run
down
to
death
the
place
in
lincolnshire
is
all
alive
by
day
guns
and
voices
are
heard
ringing
in
the
woods
horsemen
and
carriages
enliven
the
park
roads
servants
and
pervade
the
village
and
the
dedlock
arms
seen
by
night
from
distant
openings
in
the
trees
the
row
of
windows
in
the
long
where
my
lady
picture
hangs
over
the
great
is
like
a
row
of
jewels
set
in
a
black
frame
on
sunday
the
chill
little
church
is
almost
warmed
by
so
much
gallant
company
and
the
general
flavour
of
the
dedlock
dust
is
quenched
in
delicate
perfumes
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
comprehends
within
it
no
contracted
amount
of
education
sense
courage
honour
beauty
and
virtue
yet
there
is
something
a
little
wrong
about
it
in
despite
of
its
immense
advantages
what
can
it
be
dandyism
there
is
no
king
george
the
fourth
now
more
the
pity
to
set
the
dandy
fashion
there
are
no
neckcloths
no
coats
no
false
calves
no
stays
there
are
no
caricatures
now
of
effeminate
exquisites
so
arrayed
swooning
in
opera
boxes
with
excess
of
delight
and
being
revived
by
other
dainty
creatures
poking
at
their
noses
there
is
no
beau
whom
it
takes
four
men
at
once
to
shake
into
his
buckskins
or
who
goes
to
see
all
the
executions
or
who
is
troubled
with
the
of
having
once
consumed
a
pea
but
is
there
dandyism
in
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
notwithstanding
dandyism
of
a
more
mischievous
sort
that
has
got
below
the
surface
and
is
doing
less
harmless
things
than
itself
and
stopping
its
own
digestion
to
which
no
rational
person
need
particularly
object
why
yes
it
can
not
be
disguised
there
are
at
chesney
wold
this
january
week
some
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
newest
fashion
who
have
set
up
a
dandyism
in
religion
for
instance
who
in
mere
lackadaisical
want
of
an
emotion
have
agreed
upon
a
little
dandy
talk
about
the
vulgar
wanting
faith
in
things
in
general
meaning
in
the
things
that
have
been
tried
and
found
wanting
as
though
a
low
fellow
should
unaccountably
lose
faith
in
a
bad
shilling
after
finding
it
out
who
would
make
the
vulgar
very
picturesque
and
faithful
by
putting
back
the
hands
upon
the
clock
of
time
and
cancelling
a
few
hundred
years
of
history
there
are
also
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
another
fashion
not
so
new
but
very
elegant
who
have
agreed
to
put
a
smooth
glaze
on
the
world
and
to
keep
down
all
its
realities
for
whom
everything
must
be
languid
and
pretty
who
have
found
out
the
perpetual
stoppage
who
are
to
rejoice
at
nothing
and
be
sorry
for
nothing
who
are
not
to
be
disturbed
by
ideas
on
whom
even
the
fine
arts
attending
in
powder
and
walking
backward
like
the
lord
chamberlain
must
array
themselves
in
the
milliners
and
tailors
patterns
of
past
generations
and
be
particularly
careful
not
to
be
in
earnest
or
to
receive
any
impress
from
the
moving
age
then
there
is
my
lord
boodle
of
considerable
reputation
with
his
party
who
has
known
what
office
is
and
who
tells
sir
leicester
dedlock
with
much
gravity
after
dinner
that
he
really
does
not
see
to
what
the
present
age
is
tending
a
debate
is
not
what
a
debate
used
to
be
the
house
is
not
what
the
house
used
to
be
even
a
cabinet
is
not
what
it
formerly
was
he
perceives
with
astonishment
that
supposing
the
present
government
to
be
overthrown
the
limited
choice
of
the
crown
in
the
formation
of
a
new
ministry
would
lie
between
lord
coodle
and
sir
thomas
doodle
supposing
it
to
be
impossible
for
the
duke
of
foodle
to
act
with
goodle
which
may
be
assumed
to
be
the
case
in
consequence
of
the
breach
arising
out
of
that
affair
with
hoodle
then
giving
the
home
department
and
the
leadership
of
the
house
of
commons
to
joodle
the
exchequer
to
koodle
the
colonies
to
loodle
and
the
foreign
office
to
moodle
what
are
you
to
do
with
noodle
you
ca
offer
him
the
presidency
of
the
council
that
is
reserved
for
poodle
you
ca
put
him
in
the
woods
and
forests
that
is
hardly
good
enough
for
quoodle
what
follows
that
the
country
is
shipwrecked
lost
and
gone
to
pieces
as
is
made
manifest
to
the
patriotism
of
sir
leicester
dedlock
because
you
ca
provide
for
noodle
on
the
other
hand
the
right
honourable
william
buffy
contends
across
the
table
with
some
one
else
that
the
shipwreck
of
the
country
about
which
there
is
no
doubt
it
is
only
the
manner
of
it
that
is
in
question
is
attributable
to
cuffy
if
you
had
done
with
cuffy
what
you
ought
to
have
done
when
he
first
came
into
parliament
and
had
prevented
him
from
going
over
to
duffy
you
would
have
got
him
into
alliance
with
fuffy
you
would
have
had
with
you
the
weight
attaching
as
a
smart
debater
to
guffy
you
would
have
brought
to
bear
upon
the
elections
the
wealth
of
huffy
you
would
have
got
in
for
three
counties
juffy
kuffy
and
luffy
and
you
would
have
strengthened
your
administration
by
the
official
knowledge
and
the
business
habits
of
muffy
all
this
instead
of
being
as
you
now
are
dependent
on
the
mere
caprice
of
puffy
as
to
this
point
and
as
to
some
minor
topics
there
are
differences
of
opinion
but
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
all
round
that
nobody
is
in
question
but
boodle
and
his
retinue
and
buffy
and
his
retinue
these
are
the
great
actors
for
whom
the
stage
is
reserved
a
people
there
are
no
doubt
a
certain
large
number
of
supernumeraries
who
are
to
be
occasionally
addressed
and
relied
upon
for
shouts
and
choruses
as
on
the
theatrical
stage
but
boodle
and
buffy
their
followers
and
families
their
heirs
executors
administrators
and
assigns
are
the
born
managers
and
leaders
and
no
others
can
appear
upon
the
scene
for
ever
and
ever
in
this
too
there
is
perhaps
more
dandyism
at
chesney
wold
than
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
will
find
good
for
itself
in
the
long
run
for
it
is
even
with
the
stillest
and
politest
circles
as
with
the
circle
the
necromancer
draws
around
him
very
strange
appearances
may
be
seen
in
active
motion
outside
with
this
difference
that
being
realities
and
not
phantoms
there
is
the
greater
danger
of
their
breaking
in
chesney
wold
is
quite
full
anyhow
so
full
that
a
burning
sense
of
injury
arises
in
the
breasts
of
and
is
not
to
be
extinguished
only
one
room
is
empty
it
is
a
turret
chamber
of
the
third
order
of
merit
plainly
but
comfortably
furnished
and
having
an
business
air
it
is
tulkinghorn
room
and
is
never
bestowed
on
anybody
else
for
he
may
come
at
any
time
he
is
not
come
yet
it
is
his
quiet
habit
to
walk
across
the
park
from
the
village
in
fine
weather
to
drop
into
this
room
as
if
he
had
never
been
out
of
it
since
he
was
last
seen
there
to
request
a
servant
to
inform
sir
leicester
that
he
is
arrived
in
case
he
should
be
wanted
and
to
appear
ten
minutes
before
dinner
in
the
shadow
of
the
he
sleeps
in
his
turret
with
a
complaining
over
his
head
and
has
some
leads
outside
on
which
any
fine
morning
when
he
is
down
here
his
black
figure
may
be
seen
walking
before
breakfast
like
a
larger
species
of
rook
every
day
before
dinner
my
lady
looks
for
him
in
the
dusk
of
the
library
but
he
is
not
there
every
day
at
dinner
my
lady
glances
down
the
table
for
the
vacant
place
that
would
be
waiting
to
receive
him
if
he
had
just
arrived
but
there
is
no
vacant
place
every
night
my
lady
casually
asks
her
maid
is
tulkinghorn
come
every
night
the
answer
is
no
my
lady
not
yet
one
night
while
having
her
hair
undressed
my
lady
loses
herself
in
deep
thought
after
this
reply
until
she
sees
her
own
brooding
face
in
the
opposite
glass
and
a
pair
of
black
eyes
curiously
observing
her
be
so
good
as
to
attend
says
my
lady
then
addressing
the
reflection
of
hortense
to
your
business
you
can
contemplate
your
beauty
at
another
time
pardon
it
was
your
ladyship
beauty
that
says
my
lady
you
need
contemplate
at
all
at
length
one
afternoon
a
little
before
sunset
when
the
bright
groups
of
figures
which
have
for
the
last
hour
or
two
enlivened
the
ghost
walk
are
all
dispersed
and
only
sir
leicester
and
my
lady
remain
upon
the
terrace
tulkinghorn
appears
he
comes
towards
them
at
his
usual
methodical
pace
which
is
never
quickened
never
slackened
he
wears
his
usual
expressionless
mask
if
it
be
a
mask
and
carries
family
secrets
in
every
limb
of
his
body
and
every
crease
of
his
dress
whether
his
whole
soul
is
devoted
to
the
great
or
whether
he
yields
them
nothing
beyond
the
services
he
sells
is
his
personal
secret
he
keeps
it
as
he
keeps
the
secrets
of
his
clients
he
is
his
own
client
in
that
matter
and
will
never
betray
himself
how
do
you
do
mr
tulkinghorn
says
sir
leicester
giving
him
his
hand
tulkinghorn
is
quite
well
sir
leicester
is
quite
well
my
lady
is
quite
well
all
highly
satisfactory
the
lawyer
with
his
hands
behind
him
walks
at
sir
leicester
side
along
the
terrace
my
lady
walks
upon
the
other
side
we
expected
you
before
says
sir
leicester
a
gracious
observation
as
much
as
to
say
tulkinghorn
we
remember
your
existence
when
you
are
not
here
to
remind
us
of
it
by
your
presence
we
bestow
a
fragment
of
our
minds
upon
you
sir
you
see
tulkinghorn
comprehending
it
inclines
his
head
and
says
he
is
much
obliged
i
should
have
come
down
sooner
he
explains
but
that
i
have
been
much
engaged
with
those
matters
in
the
several
suits
between
yourself
and
boythorn
a
man
of
a
very
mind
observes
sir
leicester
with
severity
an
extremely
dangerous
person
in
any
community
a
man
of
a
very
low
character
of
mind
he
is
obstinate
says
tulkinghorn
it
is
natural
to
such
a
man
to
be
so
says
sir
leicester
looking
most
profoundly
obstinate
himself
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
to
hear
it
the
only
question
is
pursues
the
lawyer
whether
you
will
give
up
anything
no
sir
replies
sir
leicester
nothing
i
give
up
i
do
mean
anything
of
importance
that
of
course
i
know
you
would
not
abandon
i
mean
any
minor
point
tulkinghorn
returns
sir
leicester
there
can
be
no
minor
point
between
myself
and
boythorn
if
i
go
farther
and
observe
that
i
can
not
readily
conceive
how
any
right
of
mine
can
be
a
minor
point
i
speak
not
so
much
in
reference
to
myself
as
an
individual
as
in
reference
to
the
family
position
i
have
it
in
charge
to
maintain
tulkinghorn
inclines
his
head
again
i
have
now
my
instructions
he
says
boythorn
will
give
us
a
good
deal
of
trouble
it
is
the
character
of
such
a
mind
tulkinghorn
sir
leicester
interrupts
him
to
give
trouble
an
exceedingly
levelling
person
a
person
who
fifty
years
ago
would
probably
have
been
tried
at
the
old
bailey
for
some
demagogue
proceeding
and
severely
punished
if
not
adds
sir
leicester
after
a
pause
if
not
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
sir
leicester
appears
to
discharge
his
stately
breast
of
a
burden
in
passing
this
capital
sentence
as
if
it
were
the
next
satisfactory
thing
to
having
the
sentence
executed
but
night
is
coming
on
says
he
and
my
lady
will
take
cold
my
dear
let
us
go
in
as
they
turn
towards
the
lady
dedlock
addresses
tulkinghorn
for
the
first
time
you
sent
me
a
message
respecting
the
person
whose
writing
i
happened
to
inquire
about
it
was
like
you
to
remember
the
circumstance
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
your
message
reminded
me
of
it
again
i
imagine
what
association
i
had
with
a
hand
like
that
but
i
surely
had
some
you
had
some
tulkinghorn
repeats
oh
yes
returns
my
lady
carelessly
i
think
i
must
have
had
some
and
did
you
really
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
the
writer
of
that
actual
thing
what
is
it
affidavit
yes
how
very
odd
they
pass
into
a
sombre
on
the
ground
floor
lighted
in
the
day
by
two
deep
windows
it
is
now
twilight
the
fire
glows
brightly
on
the
panelled
wall
and
palely
on
the
where
through
the
cold
reflection
of
the
blaze
the
colder
landscape
shudders
in
the
wind
and
a
grey
mist
creeps
along
the
only
traveller
besides
the
waste
of
clouds
my
lady
lounges
in
a
great
chair
in
the
and
sir
leicester
takes
another
great
chair
opposite
the
lawyer
stands
before
the
fire
with
his
hand
out
at
arm
length
shading
his
face
he
looks
across
his
arm
at
my
lady
yes
he
says
i
inquired
about
the
man
and
found
him
and
what
is
very
strange
i
found
him
not
to
be
any
person
i
am
afraid
lady
dedlock
languidly
anticipates
i
found
him
dead
oh
dear
me
remonstrated
sir
leicester
not
so
much
shocked
by
the
fact
as
by
the
fact
of
the
fact
being
mentioned
i
was
directed
to
his
lodging
a
miserable
place
and
i
found
him
dead
you
will
excuse
me
tulkinghorn
observes
sir
leicester
i
think
the
less
said
pray
sir
leicester
let
me
hear
the
story
out
it
is
my
lady
speaking
it
is
quite
a
story
for
twilight
how
very
shocking
dead
tulkinghorn
it
by
another
inclination
of
his
head
whether
by
his
own
hand
upon
my
honour
cries
sir
leicester
really
do
let
me
hear
the
story
says
my
lady
whatever
you
desire
my
dear
but
i
must
say
no
you
must
say
go
on
mr
tulkinghorn
sir
leicester
gallantry
concedes
the
point
though
he
still
feels
that
to
bring
this
sort
of
squalor
among
the
upper
classes
is
really
really
i
was
about
to
say
resumes
the
lawyer
with
undisturbed
calmness
that
whether
he
had
died
by
his
own
hand
or
not
it
was
beyond
my
power
to
tell
you
i
should
amend
that
phrase
however
by
saying
that
he
had
unquestionably
died
of
his
own
act
though
whether
by
his
own
deliberate
intention
or
by
mischance
can
never
certainly
be
known
the
coroner
jury
found
that
he
took
the
poison
accidentally
and
what
kind
of
man
my
lady
asks
was
this
deplorable
creature
very
difficult
to
say
returns
the
lawyer
shaking
his
head
he
had
lived
so
wretchedly
and
was
so
neglected
with
his
gipsy
colour
and
his
wild
black
hair
and
beard
that
i
should
have
considered
him
the
commonest
of
the
common
the
surgeon
had
a
notion
that
he
had
once
been
something
better
both
in
appearance
and
condition
what
did
they
call
the
wretched
being
they
called
him
what
he
had
called
himself
but
no
one
knew
his
name
not
even
any
one
who
had
attended
on
him
no
one
had
attended
on
him
he
was
found
dead
in
fact
i
found
him
without
any
clue
to
anything
more
without
any
there
was
says
the
lawyer
meditatively
an
old
portmanteau
but
no
there
were
no
papers
during
the
utterance
of
every
word
of
this
short
dialogue
lady
dedlock
and
tulkinghorn
without
any
other
alteration
in
their
customary
deportment
have
looked
very
steadily
at
one
another
as
was
natural
perhaps
in
the
discussion
of
so
unusual
a
subject
sir
leicester
has
looked
at
the
fire
with
the
general
expression
of
the
dedlock
on
the
staircase
the
story
being
told
he
renews
his
stately
protest
saying
that
as
it
is
quite
clear
that
no
association
in
my
lady
mind
can
possibly
be
traceable
to
this
poor
wretch
unless
he
was
a
writer
he
trusts
to
hear
no
more
about
a
subject
so
far
removed
from
my
lady
station
certainly
a
collection
of
horrors
says
my
lady
gathering
up
her
mantles
and
furs
but
they
interest
one
for
the
moment
have
the
kindness
tulkinghorn
to
open
the
door
for
me
tulkinghorn
does
so
with
deference
and
holds
it
open
while
she
passes
out
she
passes
close
to
him
with
her
usual
fatigued
manner
and
insolent
grace
they
meet
again
at
dinner
again
next
day
again
for
many
days
in
succession
lady
dedlock
is
always
the
same
exhausted
deity
surrounded
by
worshippers
and
terribly
liable
to
be
bored
to
death
even
while
presiding
at
her
own
shrine
tulkinghorn
is
always
the
same
speechless
repository
of
noble
confidences
so
oddly
out
of
place
and
yet
so
perfectly
at
home
they
appear
to
take
as
little
note
of
one
another
as
any
two
people
enclosed
within
the
same
walls
could
but
whether
each
evermore
watches
and
suspects
the
other
evermore
mistrustful
of
some
great
reservation
whether
each
is
evermore
prepared
at
all
points
for
the
other
and
never
to
be
taken
unawares
what
each
would
give
to
know
how
much
the
other
knows
all
this
is
hidden
for
the
time
in
their
own
hearts
chapter
xiii
esther
narrative
we
held
many
consultations
about
what
richard
was
to
be
first
without
jarndyce
as
he
had
requested
and
afterwards
with
him
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
seemed
to
make
progress
richard
said
he
was
ready
for
anything
when
jarndyce
doubted
whether
he
might
not
already
be
too
old
to
enter
the
navy
richard
said
he
had
thought
of
that
and
perhaps
he
was
when
jarndyce
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
army
richard
said
he
had
thought
of
that
too
and
it
was
a
bad
idea
when
jarndyce
advised
him
to
try
and
decide
within
himself
whether
his
old
preference
for
the
sea
was
an
ordinary
boyish
inclination
or
a
strong
impulse
richard
answered
well
he
really
had
tried
very
often
and
he
could
make
out
how
much
of
this
indecision
of
character
jarndyce
said
to
me
is
chargeable
on
that
incomprehensible
heap
of
uncertainty
and
procrastination
on
which
he
has
been
thrown
from
his
birth
i
pretend
to
say
but
that
chancery
among
its
other
sins
is
responsible
for
some
of
it
i
can
plainly
see
it
has
engendered
or
confirmed
in
him
a
habit
of
putting
off
and
trusting
to
this
that
and
the
other
chance
without
knowing
what
chance
and
dismissing
everything
as
unsettled
uncertain
and
confused
the
character
of
much
older
and
steadier
people
may
be
even
changed
by
the
circumstances
surrounding
them
it
would
be
too
much
to
expect
that
a
boy
in
its
formation
should
be
the
subject
of
such
influences
and
escape
them
i
felt
this
to
be
true
though
if
i
may
venture
to
mention
what
i
thought
besides
i
thought
it
much
to
be
regretted
that
education
had
not
counteracted
those
influences
or
directed
his
character
he
had
been
eight
years
at
a
public
school
and
had
learnt
i
understood
to
make
latin
verses
of
several
sorts
in
the
most
admirable
manner
but
i
never
heard
that
it
had
been
business
to
find
out
what
his
natural
bent
was
or
where
his
failings
lay
or
to
adapt
any
kind
of
knowledge
to
him
he
had
been
adapted
to
the
verses
and
had
learnt
the
art
of
making
them
to
such
perfection
that
if
he
had
remained
at
school
until
he
was
of
age
i
suppose
he
could
only
have
gone
on
making
them
over
and
over
again
unless
he
had
enlarged
his
education
by
forgetting
how
to
do
it
still
although
i
had
no
doubt
that
they
were
very
beautiful
and
very
improving
and
very
sufficient
for
a
great
many
purposes
of
life
and
always
remembered
all
through
life
i
did
doubt
whether
richard
would
not
have
profited
by
some
one
studying
him
a
little
instead
of
his
studying
them
quite
so
much
to
be
sure
i
knew
nothing
of
the
subject
and
do
not
even
now
know
whether
the
young
gentlemen
of
classic
rome
or
greece
made
verses
to
the
same
extent
or
whether
the
young
gentlemen
of
any
country
ever
did
i
have
the
least
idea
said
richard
musing
what
i
had
better
be
except
that
i
am
quite
sure
i
do
want
to
go
into
the
church
it
a
you
have
no
inclination
in
kenge
way
suggested
jarndyce
i
do
know
that
sir
replied
richard
i
am
fond
of
boating
articled
clerks
go
a
good
deal
on
the
water
it
a
capital
profession
surgeon
suggested
jarndyce
that
the
thing
sir
cried
richard
i
doubt
if
he
had
ever
once
thought
of
it
before
that
the
thing
sir
repeated
richard
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
we
have
got
it
at
last
he
was
not
to
be
laughed
out
of
it
though
he
laughed
at
it
heartily
he
said
he
had
chosen
his
profession
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
felt
that
his
destiny
was
clear
the
art
of
healing
was
the
art
of
all
others
for
him
mistrusting
that
he
only
came
to
this
conclusion
because
having
never
had
much
chance
of
finding
out
for
himself
what
he
was
fitted
for
and
having
never
been
guided
to
the
discovery
he
was
taken
by
the
newest
idea
and
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
trouble
of
consideration
i
wondered
whether
the
latin
verses
often
ended
in
this
or
whether
richard
was
a
solitary
case
jarndyce
took
great
pains
to
talk
with
him
seriously
and
to
put
it
to
his
good
sense
not
to
deceive
himself
in
so
important
a
matter
richard
was
a
little
grave
after
these
interviews
but
invariably
told
ada
and
me
that
it
was
all
right
and
then
began
to
talk
about
something
else
by
heaven
cried
boythorn
who
interested
himself
strongly
in
the
subject
though
i
need
not
say
that
for
he
could
do
nothing
weakly
i
rejoice
to
find
a
young
gentleman
of
spirit
and
gallantry
devoting
himself
to
that
noble
profession
the
more
spirit
there
is
in
it
the
better
for
mankind
and
the
worse
for
those
mercenary
and
low
tricksters
who
delight
in
putting
that
illustrious
art
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
world
by
all
that
is
base
and
despicable
cried
boythorn
the
treatment
of
surgeons
aboard
ship
is
such
that
i
would
submit
the
legs
both
legs
of
every
member
of
the
admiralty
board
to
a
compound
fracture
and
render
it
a
transportable
offence
in
any
qualified
practitioner
to
set
them
if
the
system
were
not
wholly
changed
in
eight
and
forty
hours
would
you
give
them
a
week
asked
jarndyce
no
cried
boythorn
firmly
not
on
any
consideration
eight
and
forty
hours
as
to
corporations
parishes
and
similar
gatherings
of
clods
who
assemble
to
exchange
such
speeches
that
by
heaven
they
ought
to
be
worked
in
quicksilver
mines
for
the
short
remainder
of
their
miserable
existence
if
it
were
only
to
prevent
their
detestable
english
from
contaminating
a
language
spoken
in
the
presence
of
the
sun
as
to
those
fellows
who
meanly
take
advantage
of
the
ardour
of
gentlemen
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
to
recompense
the
inestimable
services
of
the
best
years
of
their
lives
their
long
study
and
their
expensive
education
with
pittances
too
small
for
the
acceptance
of
clerks
i
would
have
the
necks
of
every
one
of
them
wrung
and
their
skulls
arranged
in
surgeons
hall
for
the
contemplation
of
the
whole
profession
in
order
that
its
younger
members
might
understand
from
actual
measurement
in
early
life
how
thick
skulls
may
become
he
wound
up
this
vehement
declaration
by
looking
round
upon
us
with
a
most
agreeable
smile
and
suddenly
thundering
ha
ha
ha
over
and
over
again
until
anybody
else
might
have
been
expected
to
be
quite
subdued
by
the
exertion
as
richard
still
continued
to
say
that
he
was
fixed
in
his
choice
after
repeated
periods
for
consideration
had
been
recommended
by
jarndyce
and
had
expired
and
he
still
continued
to
assure
ada
and
me
in
the
same
final
manner
that
it
was
all
right
it
became
advisable
to
take
kenge
into
council
kenge
therefore
came
down
to
dinner
one
day
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
turned
his
over
and
over
and
spoke
in
a
sonorous
voice
and
did
exactly
what
i
remembered
to
have
seen
him
do
when
i
was
a
little
girl
ah
said
kenge
yes
well
a
very
good
profession
jarndyce
a
very
good
profession
the
course
of
study
and
preparation
requires
to
be
diligently
pursued
observed
my
guardian
with
a
glance
at
richard
oh
no
doubt
said
kenge
diligently
but
that
being
the
case
more
or
less
with
all
pursuits
that
are
worth
much
said
jarndyce
it
is
not
a
special
consideration
which
another
choice
would
be
likely
to
escape
truly
said
kenge
and
richard
carstone
who
has
so
meritoriously
acquitted
himself
in
the
shall
i
say
the
classic
shades
in
which
his
youth
had
been
passed
will
no
doubt
apply
the
habits
if
not
the
principles
and
practice
of
versification
in
that
tongue
in
which
a
poet
was
said
unless
i
mistake
to
be
born
not
made
to
the
more
eminently
practical
field
of
action
on
which
he
enters
you
may
rely
upon
it
said
richard
in
his
manner
that
i
shall
go
at
it
and
do
my
best
very
well
mr
jarndyce
said
kenge
gently
nodding
his
head
really
when
we
are
assured
by
richard
that
he
means
to
go
at
it
and
to
do
his
best
nodding
feelingly
and
smoothly
over
those
expressions
i
would
submit
to
you
that
we
have
only
to
inquire
into
the
best
mode
of
carrying
out
the
object
of
his
ambition
now
with
reference
to
placing
richard
with
some
sufficiently
eminent
practitioner
is
there
any
one
in
view
at
present
no
one
rick
i
think
said
my
guardian
no
one
sir
said
richard
quite
so
observed
kenge
as
to
situation
now
is
there
any
particular
feeling
on
that
head
n
no
said
richard
quite
so
observed
kenge
again
i
should
like
a
little
variety
said
richard
i
mean
a
good
range
of
experience
very
requisite
no
doubt
returned
kenge
i
think
this
may
be
easily
arranged
jarndyce
we
have
only
in
the
first
place
to
discover
a
sufficiently
eligible
practitioner
and
as
soon
as
we
make
our
want
and
shall
i
add
our
ability
to
pay
a
premium
known
our
only
difficulty
will
be
in
the
selection
of
one
from
a
large
number
we
have
only
in
the
second
place
to
observe
those
little
formalities
which
are
rendered
necessary
by
our
time
of
life
and
our
being
under
the
guardianship
of
the
court
we
shall
soon
be
shall
i
say
in
richard
own
manner
at
it
to
our
heart
content
it
is
a
coincidence
said
kenge
with
a
tinge
of
melancholy
in
his
smile
one
of
those
coincidences
which
may
or
may
not
require
an
explanation
beyond
our
present
limited
faculties
that
i
have
a
cousin
in
the
medical
profession
he
might
be
deemed
eligible
by
you
and
might
be
disposed
to
respond
to
this
proposal
i
can
answer
for
him
as
little
as
for
you
but
he
might
as
this
was
an
opening
in
the
prospect
it
was
arranged
that
kenge
should
see
his
cousin
and
as
jarndyce
had
before
proposed
to
take
us
to
london
for
a
few
weeks
it
was
settled
next
day
that
we
should
make
our
visit
at
once
and
combine
richard
business
with
it
boythorn
leaving
us
within
a
week
we
took
up
our
abode
at
a
cheerful
lodging
near
oxford
street
over
an
upholsterer
shop
london
was
a
great
wonder
to
us
and
we
were
out
for
hours
and
hours
at
a
time
seeing
the
sights
which
appeared
to
be
less
capable
of
exhaustion
than
we
were
we
made
the
round
of
the
principal
theatres
too
with
great
delight
and
saw
all
the
plays
that
were
worth
seeing
i
mention
this
because
it
was
at
the
theatre
that
i
began
to
be
made
uncomfortable
again
by
guppy
i
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
box
one
night
with
ada
and
richard
was
in
the
place
he
liked
best
behind
ada
chair
when
happening
to
look
down
into
the
pit
i
saw
guppy
with
his
hair
flattened
down
upon
his
head
and
woe
depicted
in
his
face
looking
up
at
me
i
felt
all
through
the
performance
that
he
never
looked
at
the
actors
but
constantly
looked
at
me
and
always
with
a
carefully
prepared
expression
of
the
deepest
misery
and
the
profoundest
dejection
it
quite
spoiled
my
pleasure
for
that
night
because
it
was
so
very
embarrassing
and
so
very
ridiculous
but
from
that
time
forth
we
never
went
to
the
play
without
my
seeing
guppy
in
the
pit
always
with
his
hair
straight
and
flat
his
turned
down
and
a
general
feebleness
about
him
if
he
were
not
there
when
we
went
in
and
i
began
to
hope
he
would
not
come
and
yielded
myself
for
a
little
while
to
the
interest
of
the
scene
i
was
certain
to
encounter
his
languishing
eyes
when
i
least
expected
it
and
from
that
time
to
be
quite
sure
that
they
were
fixed
upon
me
all
the
evening
i
really
can
not
express
how
uneasy
this
made
me
if
he
would
only
have
brushed
up
his
hair
or
turned
up
his
collar
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
but
to
know
that
that
absurd
figure
was
always
gazing
at
me
and
always
in
that
demonstrative
state
of
despondency
put
such
a
constraint
upon
me
that
i
did
not
like
to
laugh
at
the
play
or
to
cry
at
it
or
to
move
or
to
speak
i
seemed
able
to
do
nothing
naturally
as
to
escaping
guppy
by
going
to
the
back
of
the
box
i
could
not
bear
to
do
that
because
i
knew
richard
and
ada
relied
on
having
me
next
them
and
that
they
could
never
have
talked
together
so
happily
if
anybody
else
had
been
in
my
place
so
there
i
sat
not
knowing
where
to
look
for
wherever
i
looked
i
knew
guppy
eyes
were
following
me
and
thinking
of
the
dreadful
expense
to
which
this
young
man
was
putting
himself
on
my
account
sometimes
i
thought
of
telling
jarndyce
then
i
feared
that
the
young
man
would
lose
his
situation
and
that
i
might
ruin
him
sometimes
i
thought
of
confiding
in
richard
but
was
deterred
by
the
possibility
of
his
fighting
guppy
and
giving
him
black
eyes
sometimes
i
thought
should
i
frown
at
him
or
shake
my
head
then
i
felt
i
could
not
do
it
sometimes
i
considered
whether
i
should
write
to
his
mother
but
that
ended
in
my
being
convinced
that
to
open
a
correspondence
would
be
to
make
the
matter
worse
i
always
came
to
the
conclusion
finally
that
i
could
do
nothing
perseverance
all
this
time
not
only
produced
him
regularly
at
any
theatre
to
which
we
went
but
caused
him
to
appear
in
the
crowd
as
we
were
coming
out
and
even
to
get
up
behind
our
fly
where
i
am
sure
i
saw
him
two
or
three
times
struggling
among
the
most
dreadful
spikes
after
we
got
home
he
haunted
a
post
opposite
our
house
the
upholsterer
where
we
lodged
being
at
the
corner
of
two
streets
and
my
bedroom
window
being
opposite
the
post
i
was
afraid
to
go
near
the
window
when
i
went
upstairs
lest
i
should
see
him
as
i
did
one
moonlight
night
leaning
against
the
post
and
evidently
catching
cold
if
guppy
had
not
been
fortunately
for
me
engaged
in
the
daytime
i
really
should
have
had
no
rest
from
him
while
we
were
making
this
round
of
gaieties
in
which
guppy
so
extraordinarily
participated
the
business
which
had
helped
to
bring
us
to
town
was
not
neglected
kenge
cousin
was
a
bayham
badger
who
had
a
good
practice
at
chelsea
and
attended
a
large
public
institution
besides
he
was
quite
willing
to
receive
richard
into
his
house
and
to
superintend
his
studies
and
as
it
seemed
that
those
could
be
pursued
advantageously
under
badger
roof
and
badger
liked
richard
and
as
richard
said
he
liked
badger
well
enough
an
agreement
was
made
the
lord
chancellor
consent
was
obtained
and
it
was
all
settled
on
the
day
when
matters
were
concluded
between
richard
and
badger
we
were
all
under
engagement
to
dine
at
badger
house
we
were
to
be
merely
a
family
party
badger
note
said
and
we
found
no
lady
there
but
badger
herself
she
was
surrounded
in
the
by
various
objects
indicative
of
her
painting
a
little
playing
the
piano
a
little
playing
the
guitar
a
little
playing
the
harp
a
little
singing
a
little
working
a
little
reading
a
little
writing
poetry
a
little
and
botanizing
a
little
she
was
a
lady
of
about
fifty
i
should
think
youthfully
dressed
and
of
a
very
fine
complexion
if
i
add
to
the
little
list
of
her
accomplishments
that
she
rouged
a
little
i
do
not
mean
that
there
was
any
harm
in
it
bayham
badger
himself
was
a
pink
gentleman
with
a
weak
voice
white
teeth
light
hair
and
surprised
eyes
some
years
younger
i
should
say
than
bayham
badger
he
admired
her
exceedingly
but
principally
and
to
begin
with
on
the
curious
ground
as
it
seemed
to
us
of
her
having
had
three
husbands
we
had
barely
taken
our
seats
when
he
said
to
jarndyce
quite
triumphantly
you
would
hardly
suppose
that
i
am
bayham
badger
third
indeed
said
jarndyce
her
third
said
badger
bayham
badger
has
not
the
appearance
miss
summerson
of
a
lady
who
has
had
two
former
husbands
i
said
not
at
all
and
most
remarkable
men
said
badger
in
a
tone
of
confidence
captain
swosser
of
the
royal
navy
who
was
badger
first
husband
was
a
very
distinguished
officer
indeed
the
name
of
professor
dingo
my
immediate
predecessor
is
one
of
european
reputation
badger
overheard
him
and
smiled
yes
my
dear
badger
replied
to
the
smile
i
was
observing
to
jarndyce
and
miss
summerson
that
you
had
had
two
former
husbands
both
very
distinguished
men
and
they
found
it
as
people
generally
do
difficult
to
believe
i
was
barely
twenty
said
badger
when
i
married
captain
swosser
of
the
royal
navy
i
was
in
the
mediterranean
with
him
i
am
quite
a
sailor
on
the
twelfth
anniversary
of
my
i
became
the
wife
of
professor
dingo
of
european
reputation
added
badger
in
an
undertone
and
when
badger
and
myself
were
married
pursued
badger
we
were
married
on
the
same
day
of
the
year
i
had
become
attached
to
the
day
so
that
badger
has
been
married
to
three
husbands
two
of
them
highly
distinguished
men
said
badger
summing
up
the
facts
and
each
time
upon
the
of
march
at
eleven
in
the
forenoon
we
all
expressed
our
admiration
but
for
badger
modesty
said
jarndyce
i
would
take
leave
to
correct
him
and
say
three
distinguished
men
thank
you
jarndyce
what
i
always
tell
him
observed
badger
and
my
dear
said
badger
what
do
i
always
tell
you
that
without
any
affectation
of
disparaging
such
professional
distinction
as
i
may
have
attained
which
our
friend
carstone
will
have
many
opportunities
of
estimating
i
am
not
so
weak
no
really
said
badger
to
us
generally
so
unreasonable
as
to
put
my
reputation
on
the
same
footing
with
such
men
as
captain
swosser
and
professor
dingo
perhaps
you
may
be
interested
jarndyce
continued
bayham
badger
leading
the
way
into
the
next
in
this
portrait
of
captain
swosser
it
was
taken
on
his
return
home
from
the
african
station
where
he
had
suffered
from
the
fever
of
the
country
badger
considers
it
too
yellow
but
it
a
very
fine
head
a
very
fine
head
we
all
echoed
a
very
fine
head
i
feel
when
i
look
at
it
said
badger
a
man
i
should
like
to
have
seen
it
strikingly
bespeaks
the
man
that
captain
swosser
was
on
the
other
side
professor
dingo
i
knew
him
well
attended
him
in
his
last
illness
a
speaking

the

over
the
sofa
bayham
badger
when
dingo
of
bayham
badger
in
esse
i
possess
the
original
and
have
no
copy
dinner
was
now
announced
and
we
went
downstairs
it
was
a
very
genteel
entertainment
very
handsomely
served
but
the
captain
and
the
professor
still
ran
in
badger
head
and
as
ada
and
i
had
the
honour
of
being
under
his
particular
care
we
had
the
full
benefit
of
them
water
miss
summerson
allow
me
not
in
that
tumbler
pray
bring
me
the
professor
goblet
james
ada
very
much
admired
some
artificial
flowers
under
a
glass
astonishing
how
they
keep
said
badger
they
were
presented
to
bayham
badger
when
she
was
in
the
mediterranean
he
invited
jarndyce
to
take
a
glass
of
claret
not
that
claret
he
said
excuse
me
this
is
an
occasion
and
on
an
occasion
i
produce
some
very
special
claret
i
happen
to
have
james
captain
swosser
wine
jarndyce
this
is
a
wine
that
was
imported
by
the
captain
we
will
not
say
how
many
years
ago
you
will
find
it
very
curious
my
dear
i
shall
be
happy
to
take
some
of
this
wine
with
you
captain
swosser
claret
to
your
mistress
james
my
love
your
health
after
dinner
when
we
ladies
retired
we
took
badger
first
and
second
husband
with
us
badger
gave
us
in
the
a
biographical
sketch
of
the
life
and
services
of
captain
swosser
before
his
marriage
and
a
more
minute
account
of
him
dating
from
the
time
when
he
fell
in
love
with
her
at
a
ball
on
board
the
crippler
given
to
the
officers
of
that
ship
when
she
lay
in
plymouth
harbour
the
dear
old
crippler
said
badger
shaking
her
head
she
was
a
noble
vessel
trim
all
a
taunto
as
captain
swosser
used
to
say
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
occasionally
introduce
a
nautical
expression
i
was
quite
a
sailor
once
captain
swosser
loved
that
craft
for
my
sake
when
she
was
no
longer
in
commission
he
frequently
said
that
if
he
were
rich
enough
to
buy
her
old
hulk
he
would
have
an
inscription
let
into
the
timbers
of
the
where
we
stood
as
partners
in
the
dance
to
mark
the
spot
where
he
fell
raked
fore
and
aft
captain
swosser
used
to
say
by
the
fire
from
my
tops
it
was
his
naval
way
of
mentioning
my
eyes
badger
shook
her
head
sighed
and
looked
in
the
glass
it
was
a
great
change
from
captain
swosser
to
professor
dingo
she
resumed
with
a
plaintive
smile
i
felt
it
a
good
deal
at
first
such
an
entire
revolution
in
my
mode
of
life
but
custom
combined
with
science
particularly
science
inured
me
to
it
being
the
sole
companion
in
his
botanical
excursions
i
almost
forgot
that
i
had
ever
been
afloat
and
became
quite
learned
it
is
singular
that
the
professor
was
the
antipodes
of
captain
swosser
and
that
badger
is
not
in
the
least
like
either
we
then
passed
into
a
narrative
of
the
deaths
of
captain
swosser
and
professor
dingo
both
of
whom
seem
to
have
had
very
bad
complaints
in
the
course
of
it
badger
signified
to
us
that
she
had
never
madly
loved
but
once
and
that
the
object
of
that
wild
affection
never
to
be
recalled
in
its
fresh
enthusiasm
was
captain
swosser
the
professor
was
yet
dying
by
inches
in
the
most
dismal
manner
and
badger
was
giving
us
imitations
of
his
way
of
saying
with
great
difficulty
where
is
laura
let
laura
give
me
my
toast
and
water
when
the
entrance
of
the
gentlemen
consigned
him
to
the
tomb
now
i
observed
that
evening
as
i
had
observed
for
some
days
past
that
ada
and
richard
were
more
than
ever
attached
to
each
society
which
was
but
natural
seeing
that
they
were
going
to
be
separated
so
soon
i
was
therefore
not
very
much
surprised
when
we
got
home
and
ada
and
i
retired
upstairs
to
find
ada
more
silent
than
usual
though
i
was
not
quite
prepared
for
her
coming
into
my
arms
and
beginning
to
speak
to
me
with
her
face
hidden
my
darling
esther
murmured
ada
i
have
a
great
secret
to
tell
you
a
mighty
secret
my
pretty
one
no
doubt
what
is
it
ada
oh
esther
you
would
never
guess
shall
i
try
to
guess
said
i
oh
no
do
pray
do
cried
ada
very
much
startled
by
the
idea
of
my
doing
so
now
i
wonder
who
it
can
be
about
said
i
pretending
to
consider
it
about
said
ada
in
a
whisper
it
about
my
cousin
richard
well
my
own
said
i
kissing
her
bright
hair
which
was
all
i
could
see
and
what
about
him
oh
esther
you
would
never
guess
it
was
so
pretty
to
have
her
clinging
to
me
in
that
way
hiding
her
face
and
to
know
that
she
was
not
crying
in
sorrow
but
in
a
little
glow
of
joy
and
pride
and
hope
that
i
would
not
help
her
just
yet
he
says
i
know
it
very
foolish
we
are
both
so
young
but
he
says
with
a
burst
of
tears
that
he
loves
me
dearly
esther
does
he
indeed
said
i
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
why
my
pet
of
pets
i
could
have
told
you
that
weeks
and
weeks
ago
to
see
ada
lift
up
her
flushed
face
in
joyful
surprise
and
hold
me
round
the
neck
and
laugh
and
cry
and
blush
was
so
pleasant
why
my
darling
said
i
what
a
goose
you
must
take
me
for
your
cousin
richard
has
been
loving
you
as
plainly
as
he
could
for
i
know
how
long
and
yet
you
never
said
a
word
about
it
cried
ada
kissing
me
no
my
love
said
i
i
waited
to
be
told
but
now
i
have
told
you
you
do
think
it
wrong
of
me
do
you
returned
ada
she
might
have
coaxed
me
to
say
no
if
i
had
been
the
duenna
in
the
world
not
being
that
yet
i
said
no
very
freely
and
now
said
i
i
know
the
worst
of
it
oh
that
not
quite
the
worst
of
it
esther
dear
cried
ada
holding
me
tighter
and
laying
down
her
face
again
upon
my
breast
no
said
i
not
even
that
no
not
even
that
said
ada
shaking
her
head
why
you
never
mean
to
say
i
was
beginning
in
joke
but
ada
looking
up
and
smiling
through
her
tears
cried
yes
i
do
you
know
you
know
i
do
and
then
sobbed
out
with
all
my
heart
i
do
with
all
my
whole
heart
esther
i
told
her
laughing
why
i
had
known
that
too
just
as
well
as
i
had
known
the
other
and
we
sat
before
the
fire
and
i
had
all
the
talking
to
myself
for
a
little
while
though
there
was
not
much
of
it
and
ada
was
soon
quiet
and
happy
do
you
think
my
cousin
john
knows
dear
dame
durden
she
asked
unless
my
cousin
john
is
blind
my
pet
said
i
i
should
think
my
cousin
john
knows
pretty
well
as
much
as
we
know
we
want
to
speak
to
him
before
richard
goes
said
ada
timidly
and
we
wanted
you
to
advise
us
and
to
tell
him
so
perhaps
you
mind
richard
coming
in
dame
durden
oh
richard
is
outside
is
he
my
dear
said
i
i
am
not
quite
certain
returned
ada
with
a
bashful
simplicity
that
would
have
won
my
heart
if
she
had
not
won
it
long
before
but
i
think
he
waiting
at
the
door
there
he
was
of
course
they
brought
a
chair
on
either
side
of
me
and
put
me
between
them
and
really
seemed
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
me
instead
of
one
another
they
were
so
confiding
and
so
trustful
and
so
fond
of
me
they
went
on
in
their
own
wild
way
for
a
little
while
i
never
stopped
them
i
enjoyed
it
too
much
myself
and
then
we
gradually
fell
to
considering
how
young
they
were
and
how
there
must
be
a
lapse
of
several
years
before
this
early
love
could
come
to
anything
and
how
it
could
come
to
happiness
only
if
it
were
real
and
lasting
and
inspired
them
with
a
steady
resolution
to
do
their
duty
to
each
other
with
constancy
fortitude
and
perseverance
each
always
for
the
other
sake
well
richard
said
that
he
would
work
his
fingers
to
the
bone
for
ada
and
ada
said
that
she
would
work
her
fingers
to
the
bone
for
richard
and
they
called
me
all
sorts
of
endearing
and
sensible
names
and
we
sat
there
advising
and
talking
half
the
night
finally
before
we
parted
i
gave
them
my
promise
to
speak
to
their
cousin
john
so
when
came
i
went
to
my
guardian
after
breakfast
in
the
room
that
was
our
for
the
growlery
and
told
him
that
i
had
it
in
trust
to
tell
him
something
well
little
woman
said
he
shutting
up
his
book
if
you
have
accepted
the
trust
there
can
be
no
harm
in
it
i
hope
not
guardian
said
i
i
can
guarantee
that
there
is
no
secrecy
in
it
for
it
only
happened
yesterday
aye
and
what
is
it
esther
guardian
said
i
you
remember
the
happy
night
when
first
we
came
down
to
bleak
house
when
ada
was
singing
in
the
dark
room
i
wished
to
call
to
his
remembrance
the
look
he
had
given
me
then
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
i
saw
that
i
did
so
because
said
i
with
a
little
hesitation
yes
my
dear
said
he
do
hurry
because
said
i
ada
and
richard
have
fallen
in
love
and
have
told
each
other
so
already
cried
my
guardian
quite
astonished
yes
said
i
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
guardian
i
rather
expected
it
the
deuce
you
did
said
he
he
sat
considering
for
a
minute
or
two
with
his
smile
at
once
so
handsome
and
so
kind
upon
his
changing
face
and
then
requested
me
to
let
them
know
that
he
wished
to
see
them
when
they
came
he
encircled
ada
with
one
arm
in
his
fatherly
way
and
addressed
himself
to
richard
with
a
cheerful
gravity
rick
said
jarndyce
i
am
glad
to
have
won
your
confidence
i
hope
to
preserve
it
when
i
contemplated
these
relations
between
us
four
which
have
so
brightened
my
life
and
so
invested
it
with
new
interests
and
pleasures
i
certainly
did
contemplate
afar
off
the
possibility
of
you
and
your
pretty
cousin
here
do
be
shy
ada
do
be
shy
my
dear
being
in
a
mind
to
go
through
life
together
i
saw
and
do
see
many
reasons
to
make
it
desirable
but
that
was
afar
off
rick
afar
off
we
look
afar
off
sir
returned
richard
well
said
jarndyce
that
rational
now
hear
me
my
dears
i
might
tell
you
that
you
do
know
your
own
minds
yet
that
a
thousand
things
may
happen
to
divert
you
from
one
another
that
it
is
well
this
chain
of
flowers
you
have
taken
up
is
very
easily
broken
or
it
might
become
a
chain
of
lead
but
i
will
not
do
that
such
wisdom
will
come
soon
enough
i
dare
say
if
it
is
to
come
at
all
i
will
assume
that
a
few
years
hence
you
will
be
in
your
hearts
to
one
another
what
you
are
all
i
say
before
speaking
to
you
according
to
that
assumption
is
if
you
do
change
if
you
do
come
to
find
that
you
are
more
commonplace
cousins
to
each
other
as
man
and
woman
than
you
were
as
boy
and
girl
your
manhood
will
excuse
me
rick
do
be
ashamed
still
to
confide
in
me
for
there
will
be
nothing
monstrous
or
uncommon
in
it
i
am
only
your
friend
and
distant
kinsman
i
have
no
power
over
you
whatever
but
i
wish
and
hope
to
retain
your
confidence
if
i
do
nothing
to
forfeit
it
i
am
very
sure
sir
returned
richard
that
i
speak
for
ada
too
when
i
say
that
you
have
the
strongest
power
over
us
both
rooted
in
respect
gratitude
and
affection
strengthening
every
day
dear
cousin
john
said
ada
on
his
shoulder
my
father
place
can
never
be
empty
again
all
the
love
and
duty
i
could
ever
have
rendered
to
him
is
transferred
to
you
come
said
jarndyce
now
for
our
assumption
now
we
lift
our
eyes
up
and
look
hopefully
at
the
distance
rick
the
world
is
before
you
and
it
is
most
probable
that
as
you
enter
it
so
it
will
receive
you
trust
in
nothing
but
in
providence
and
your
own
efforts
never
separate
the
two
like
the
heathen
waggoner
constancy
in
love
is
a
good
thing
but
it
means
nothing
and
is
nothing
without
constancy
in
every
kind
of
effort
if
you
had
the
abilities
of
all
the
great
men
past
and
present
you
could
do
nothing
well
without
sincerely
meaning
it
and
setting
about
it
if
you
entertain
the
supposition
that
any
real
success
in
great
things
or
in
small
ever
was
or
could
be
ever
will
or
can
be
wrested
from
fortune
by
fits
and
starts
leave
that
wrong
idea
here
or
leave
your
cousin
ada
here
i
will
leave
it
here
sir
replied
richard
smiling
if
i
brought
it
here
just
now
but
i
hope
i
did
not
and
will
work
my
way
on
to
my
cousin
ada
in
the
hopeful
distance
right
said
jarndyce
if
you
are
not
to
make
her
happy
why
should
you
pursue
her
i
would
make
her
unhappy
no
not
even
for
her
love
retorted
richard
proudly
well
said
cried
jarndyce
that
well
said
she
remains
here
in
her
home
with
me
love
her
rick
in
your
active
life
no
less
than
in
her
home
when
you
revisit
it
and
all
will
go
well
otherwise
all
will
go
that
the
end
of
my
preaching
i
think
you
and
ada
had
better
take
a
walk
ada
tenderly
embraced
him
and
richard
heartily
shook
hands
with
him
and
then
the
cousins
went
out
of
the
room
looking
back
again
directly
though
to
say
that
they
would
wait
for
me
the
door
stood
open
and
we
both
followed
them
with
our
eyes
as
they
passed
down
the
adjoining
room
on
which
the
sun
was
shining
and
out
at
its
farther
end
richard
with
his
head
bent
and
her
hand
drawn
through
his
arm
was
talking
to
her
very
earnestly
and
she
looked
up
in
his
face
listening
and
seemed
to
see
nothing
else
so
young
so
beautiful
so
full
of
hope
and
promise
they
went
on
lightly
through
the
sunlight
as
their
own
happy
thoughts
might
then
be
traversing
the
years
to
come
and
making
them
all
years
of
brightness
so
they
passed
away
into
the
shadow
and
were
gone
it
was
only
a
burst
of
light
that
had
been
so
radiant
the
room
darkened
as
they
went
out
and
the
sun
was
clouded
over
am
i
right
esther
said
my
guardian
when
they
were
gone
he
was
so
good
and
wise
to
ask
me
whether
he
was
right
rick
may
gain
out
of
this
the
quality
he
wants
wants
at
the
core
of
so
much
that
is
good
said
jarndyce
shaking
his
head
i
have
said
nothing
to
ada
esther
she
has
her
friend
and
counsellor
always
near
and
he
laid
his
hand
lovingly
upon
my
head
i
could
not
help
showing
that
i
was
a
little
moved
though
i
did
all
i
could
to
conceal
it
tut
tut
said
he
but
we
must
take
care
too
that
our
little
woman
life
is
not
all
consumed
in
care
for
others
care
my
dear
guardian
i
believe
i
am
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world
i
believe
so
too
said
he
but
some
one
may
find
out
what
esther
never
will
that
the
little
woman
is
to
be
held
in
remembrance
above
all
other
people
i
have
omitted
to
mention
in
its
place
that
there
was
some
one
else
at
the
family
dinner
party
it
was
not
a
lady
it
was
a
gentleman
it
was
a
gentleman
of
a
dark
complexion
a
young
surgeon
he
was
rather
reserved
but
i
thought
him
very
sensible
and
agreeable
at
least
ada
asked
me
if
i
did
not
and
i
said
yes
chapter
xiv
deportment
richard
left
us
on
the
very
next
evening
to
begin
his
new
career
and
committed
ada
to
my
charge
with
great
love
for
her
and
great
trust
in
me
it
touched
me
then
to
reflect
and
it
touches
me
now
more
nearly
to
remember
having
what
i
have
to
tell
how
they
both
thought
of
me
even
at
that
engrossing
time
i
was
a
part
of
all
their
plans
for
the
present
and
the
future
i
was
to
write
richard
once
a
week
making
my
faithful
report
of
ada
who
was
to
write
to
him
every
alternate
day
i
was
to
be
informed
under
his
own
hand
of
all
his
labours
and
successes
i
was
to
observe
how
resolute
and
persevering
he
would
be
i
was
to
be
ada
bridesmaid
when
they
were
married
i
was
to
live
with
them
afterwards
i
was
to
keep
all
the
keys
of
their
house
i
was
to
be
made
happy
for
ever
and
a
day
and
if
the
suit
should
make
us
rich
esther
which
it
may
you
know
said
richard
to
crown
all
a
shade
crossed
ada
face
my
dearest
ada
asked
richard
why
not
it
had
better
declare
us
poor
at
once
said
ada
oh
i
do
know
about
that
returned
richard
but
at
all
events
it
wo
declare
anything
at
once
it
has
declared
anything
in
heaven
knows
how
many
years
too
true
said
ada
yes
but
urged
richard
answering
what
her
look
suggested
rather
than
her
words
the
longer
it
goes
on
dear
cousin
the
nearer
it
must
be
to
a
settlement
one
way
or
other
now
is
not
that
reasonable
you
know
best
richard
but
i
am
afraid
if
we
trust
to
it
it
will
make
us
unhappy
but
my
ada
we
are
not
going
to
trust
to
it
cried
richard
gaily
we
know
it
better
than
to
trust
to
it
we
only
say
that
if
it
should
make
us
rich
we
have
no
constitutional
objection
to
being
rich
the
court
is
by
solemn
settlement
of
law
our
grim
old
guardian
and
we
are
to
suppose
that
what
it
gives
us
when
it
gives
us
anything
is
our
right
it
is
not
necessary
to
quarrel
with
our
right
no
said
ada
but
it
may
be
better
to
forget
all
about
it
well
well
cried
richard
then
we
will
forget
all
about
it
we
consign
the
whole
thing
to
oblivion
dame
durden
puts
on
her
approving
face
and
it
done
dame
durden
approving
face
said
i
looking
out
of
the
box
in
which
i
was
packing
his
books
was
not
very
visible
when
you
called
it
by
that
name
but
it
does
approve
and
she
thinks
you
ca
do
better
so
richard
said
there
was
an
end
of
it
and
immediately
began
on
no
other
foundation
to
build
as
many
castles
in
the
air
as
would
man
the
great
wall
of
china
he
went
away
in
high
spirits
ada
and
i
prepared
to
miss
him
very
much
commenced
our
quieter
career
on
our
arrival
in
london
we
had
called
with
jarndyce
at
jellyby
but
had
not
been
so
fortunate
as
to
find
her
at
home
it
appeared
that
she
had
gone
somewhere
to
a
and
had
taken
miss
jellyby
with
her
besides
the
there
was
to
be
some
considerable
and
on
the
general
merits
of
the
cultivation
of
coffee
conjointly
with
natives
at
the
settlement
of
all
this
involved
no
doubt
sufficient
active
exercise
of
pen
and
ink
to
make
her
daughter
part
in
the
proceedings
anything
but
a
holiday
it
being
now
beyond
the
time
appointed
for
jellyby
return
we
called
again
she
was
in
town
but
not
at
home
having
gone
to
mile
end
directly
after
breakfast
on
some
borrioboolan
business
arising
out
of
a
society
called
the
east
london
branch
aid
ramification
as
i
had
not
seen
peepy
on
the
occasion
of
our
last
call
when
he
was
not
to
be
found
anywhere
and
when
the
cook
rather
thought
he
must
have
strolled
away
with
the
dustman
cart
i
now
inquired
for
him
again
the
oyster
shells
he
had
been
building
a
house
with
were
still
in
the
passage
but
he
was
nowhere
discoverable
and
the
cook
supposed
that
he
had
gone
after
the
sheep
when
we
repeated
with
some
surprise
the
sheep
she
said
oh
yes
on
market
days
he
sometimes
followed
them
quite
out
of
town
and
came
back
in
such
a
state
as
never
was
i
was
sitting
at
the
window
with
my
guardian
on
the
following
morning
and
ada
was
busy
writing
of
course
to
richard
when
miss
jellyby
was
announced
and
entered
leading
the
identical
peepy
whom
she
had
made
some
endeavours
to
render
presentable
by
wiping
the
dirt
into
corners
of
his
face
and
hands
and
making
his
hair
very
wet
and
then
violently
frizzling
it
with
her
fingers
everything
the
dear
child
wore
was
either
too
large
for
him
or
too
small
among
his
other
contradictory
decorations
he
had
the
hat
of
a
bishop
and
the
little
gloves
of
a
baby
his
boots
were
on
a
small
scale
the
boots
of
a
ploughman
while
his
legs
so
crossed
and
recrossed
with
scratches
that
they
looked
like
maps
were
bare
below
a
very
short
pair
of
plaid
drawers
finished
off
with
two
frills
of
perfectly
different
patterns
the
deficient
buttons
on
his
plaid
frock
had
evidently
been
supplied
from
one
of
jellyby
coats
they
were
so
extremely
brazen
and
so
much
too
large
most
extraordinary
specimens
of
needlework
appeared
on
several
parts
of
his
dress
where
it
had
been
hastily
mended
and
i
recognized
the
same
hand
on
miss
jellyby
she
was
however
unaccountably
improved
in
her
appearance
and
looked
very
pretty
she
was
conscious
of
poor
little
peepy
being
but
a
failure
after
all
her
trouble
and
she
showed
it
as
she
came
in
by
the
way
in
which
she
glanced
first
at
him
and
then
at
us
oh
dear
me
said
my
guardian
due
east
ada
and
i
gave
her
a
cordial
welcome
and
presented
her
to
jarndyce
to
whom
she
said
as
she
sat
down
ma
compliments
and
she
hopes
you
excuse
her
because
she
correcting
proofs
of
the
plan
she
going
to
put
out
five
thousand
new
circulars
and
she
knows
you
be
interested
to
hear
that
i
have
brought
one
of
them
with
me
ma
compliments
with
which
she
presented
it
sulkily
enough
thank
you
said
my
guardian
i
am
much
obliged
to
jellyby
oh
dear
me
this
is
a
very
trying
wind
we
were
busy
with
peepy
taking
off
his
clerical
hat
asking
him
if
he
remembered
us
and
so
on
peepy
retired
behind
his
elbow
at
first
but
relented
at
the
sight
of
and
allowed
me
to
take
him
on
my
lap
where
he
sat
munching
quietly
jarndyce
then
withdrawing
into
the
temporary
growlery
miss
jellyby
opened
a
conversation
with
her
usual
abruptness
we
are
going
on
just
as
bad
as
ever
in
thavies
inn
said
she
i
have
no
peace
of
my
life
talk
of
africa
i
could
be
worse
off
if
i
was
a
man
and
a
brother
i
tried
to
say
something
soothing
oh
it
of
no
use
miss
summerson
exclaimed
miss
jellyby
though
i
thank
you
for
the
kind
intention
all
the
same
i
know
how
i
am
used
and
i
am
not
to
be
talked
over
you
would
be
talked
over
if
you
were
used
so
peepy
go
and
play
at
wild
beasts
under
the
piano
i
sha
said
peepy
very
well
you
ungrateful
naughty
boy
returned
miss
jellyby
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
never
take
pains
to
dress
you
any
more
yes
i
will
go
caddy
cried
peepy
who
was
really
a
good
child
and
who
was
so
moved
by
his
sister
vexation
that
he
went
at
once
it
seems
a
little
thing
to
cry
about
said
poor
miss
jellyby
apologetically
but
i
am
quite
worn
out
i
was
directing
the
new
circulars
till
two
this
morning
i
detest
the
whole
thing
so
that
that
alone
makes
my
head
ache
till
i
ca
see
out
of
my
eyes
and
look
at
that
poor
unfortunate
child
was
there
ever
such
a
fright
as
he
is
peepy
happily
unconscious
of
the
defects
in
his
appearance
sat
on
the
carpet
behind
one
of
the
legs
of
the
piano
looking
calmly
out
of
his
den
at
us
while
he
ate
his
cake
i
have
sent
him
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
observed
miss
jellyby
drawing
her
chair
nearer
ours
because
i
do
want
him
to
hear
the
conversation
those
little
things
are
so
sharp
i
was
going
to
say
we
really
are
going
on
worse
than
ever
pa
will
be
a
bankrupt
before
long
and
then
i
hope
ma
will
be
satisfied
there
he
nobody
but
ma
to
thank
for
it
we
said
we
hoped
jellyby
affairs
were
not
in
so
bad
a
state
as
that
it
of
no
use
hoping
though
it
very
kind
of
you
returned
miss
jellyby
shaking
her
head
pa
told
me
only
yesterday
morning
and
dreadfully
unhappy
he
is
that
he
could
weather
the
storm
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
could
when
all
our
tradesmen
send
into
our
house
any
stuff
they
like
and
the
servants
do
what
they
like
with
it
and
i
have
no
time
to
improve
things
if
i
knew
how
and
ma
care
about
anything
i
should
like
to
make
out
how
pa
is
to
weather
the
storm
i
declare
if
i
was
pa
i
run
away
my
dear
said
i
smiling
your
papa
no
doubt
considers
his
family
oh
yes
his
family
is
all
very
fine
miss
summerson
replied
miss
jellyby
but
what
comfort
is
his
family
to
him
his
family
is
nothing
but
bills
dirt
waste
noise
tumbles
downstairs
confusion
and
wretchedness
his
scrambling
home
from
week
end
to
week
end
is
like
one
great
only
nothing
washed
miss
jellyby
tapped
her
foot
upon
the
floor
and
wiped
her
eyes
i
am
sure
i
pity
pa
to
that
degree
she
said
and
am
so
angry
with
ma
that
i
ca
find
words
to
express
myself
however
i
am
not
going
to
bear
it
i
am
determined
i
wo
be
a
slave
all
my
life
and
i
wo
submit
to
be
proposed
to
by
quale
a
pretty
thing
indeed
to
marry
a
philanthropist
as
if
i
had
had
enough
of
that
said
poor
miss
jellyby
i
must
confess
that
i
could
not
help
feeling
rather
angry
with
jellyby
myself
seeing
and
hearing
this
neglected
girl
and
knowing
how
much
of
bitterly
satirical
truth
there
was
in
what
she
said
if
it
was
that
we
had
been
intimate
when
you
stopped
at
our
house
pursued
miss
jellyby
i
should
have
been
ashamed
to
come
here
for
i
know
what
a
figure
i
must
seem
to
you
two
but
as
it
is
i
made
up
my
mind
to
call
especially
as
i
am
not
likely
to
see
you
again
the
next
time
you
come
to
town
she
said
this
with
such
great
significance
that
ada
and
i
glanced
at
one
another
foreseeing
something
more
no
said
miss
jellyby
shaking
her
head
not
at
all
likely
i
know
i
may
trust
you
two
i
am
sure
you
wo
betray
me
i
am
engaged
without
their
knowledge
at
home
said
i
why
good
gracious
me
miss
summerson
she
returned
justifying
herself
in
a
fretful
but
not
angry
manner
how
can
it
be
otherwise
you
know
what
ma
is
and
i
need
make
poor
pa
more
miserable
by
telling
him
but
would
it
not
be
adding
to
his
unhappiness
to
marry
without
his
knowledge
or
consent
my
dear
said
i
no
said
miss
jellyby
softening
i
hope
not
i
should
try
to
make
him
happy
and
comfortable
when
he
came
to
see
me
and
peepy
and
the
others
should
take
it
in
turns
to
come
and
stay
with
me
and
they
should
have
some
care
taken
of
them
then
there
was
a
good
deal
of
affection
in
poor
caddy
she
softened
more
and
more
while
saying
this
and
cried
so
much
over
the
unwonted
little
she
had
raised
in
her
mind
that
peepy
in
his
cave
under
the
piano
was
touched
and
turned
himself
over
on
his
back
with
loud
lamentations
it
was
not
until
i
had
brought
him
to
kiss
his
sister
and
had
restored
him
to
his
place
on
my
lap
and
had
shown
him
that
caddy
was
laughing
she
laughed
expressly
for
the
purpose
that
we
could
recall
his
peace
of
mind
even
then
it
was
for
some
time
conditional
on
his
taking
us
in
turns
by
the
chin
and
smoothing
our
faces
all
over
with
his
hand
at
last
as
his
spirits
were
not
equal
to
the
piano
we
put
him
on
a
chair
to
look
out
of
window
and
miss
jellyby
holding
him
by
one
leg
resumed
her
confidence
it
began
in
your
coming
to
our
house
she
said
we
naturally
asked
how
i
felt
i
was
so
awkward
she
replied
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
improved
in
that
respect
at
all
events
and
to
learn
to
dance
i
told
ma
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
and
i
must
be
taught
to
dance
ma
looked
at
me
in
that
provoking
way
of
hers
as
if
i
was
in
sight
but
i
was
quite
determined
to
be
taught
to
dance
and
so
i
went
to
turveydrop
academy
in
newman
street
and
was
it
there
my
dear
i
began
yes
it
was
there
said
caddy
and
i
am
engaged
to
turveydrop
there
are
two
turveydrops
father
and
son
my
turveydrop
is
the
son
of
course
i
only
wish
i
had
been
better
brought
up
and
was
likely
to
make
him
a
better
wife
for
i
am
very
fond
of
him
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
said
i
i
must
confess
i
do
know
why
you
should
be
sorry
she
retorted
a
little
anxiously
but
i
am
engaged
to
turveydrop
whether
or
no
and
he
is
very
fond
of
me
it
a
secret
as
yet
even
on
his
side
because
old
turveydrop
has
a
share
in
the
connexion
and
it
might
break
his
heart
or
give
him
some
other
shock
if
he
was
told
of
it
abruptly
old
turveydrop
is
a
very
gentlemanly
man
indeed
very
gentlemanly
does
his
wife
know
of
it
asked
ada
old
turveydrop
wife
miss
clare
returned
miss
jellyby
opening
her
eyes
there
no
such
person
he
is
a
widower
we
were
here
interrupted
by
peepy
whose
leg
had
undergone
so
much
on
account
of
his
sister
unconsciously
jerking
it
like
a
whenever
she
was
emphatic
that
the
afflicted
child
now
bemoaned
his
sufferings
with
a
very
noise
as
he
appealed
to
me
for
compassion
and
as
i
was
only
a
listener
i
undertook
to
hold
him
miss
jellyby
proceeded
after
begging
peepy
pardon
with
a
kiss
and
assuring
him
that
she
had
meant
to
do
it
that
the
state
of
the
case
said
caddy
if
i
ever
blame
myself
i
still
think
it
ma
fault
we
are
to
be
married
whenever
we
can
and
then
i
shall
go
to
pa
at
the
office
and
write
to
ma
it
much
agitate
ma
i
am
only
pen
and
ink
to
her
one
great
comfort
is
said
caddy
with
a
sob
that
i
shall
never
hear
of
africa
after
i
am
married
young
turveydrop
hates
it
for
my
sake
and
if
old
turveydrop
knows
there
is
such
a
place
it
as
much
as
he
does
it
was
he
who
was
very
gentlemanly
i
think
said
i
very
gentlemanly
indeed
said
caddy
he
is
celebrated
almost
everywhere
for
his
deportment
does
he
teach
asked
ada
no
he
do
teach
anything
in
particular
replied
caddy
but
his
deportment
is
beautiful
caddy
went
on
to
say
with
considerable
hesitation
and
reluctance
that
there
was
one
thing
more
she
wished
us
to
know
and
felt
we
ought
to
know
and
which
she
hoped
would
not
offend
us
it
was
that
she
had
improved
her
acquaintance
with
miss
flite
the
little
crazy
old
lady
and
that
she
frequently
went
there
early
in
the
morning
and
met
her
lover
for
a
few
minutes
before
breakfast
only
for
a
few
minutes
i
go
there
at
other
times
said
caddy
but
prince
does
not
come
then
young
turveydrop
name
is
prince
i
wish
it
was
because
it
sounds
like
a
dog
but
of
course
he
did
christen
himself
old
turveydrop
had
him
christened
prince
in
remembrance
of
the
prince
regent
old
turveydrop
adored
the
prince
regent
on
account
of
his
deportment
i
hope
you
wo
think
the
worse
of
me
for
having
made
these
little
appointments
at
miss
flite
where
i
first
went
with
you
because
i
like
the
poor
thing
for
her
own
sake
and
i
believe
she
likes
me
if
you
could
see
young
turveydrop
i
am
sure
you
would
think
well
of
him
at
least
i
am
sure
you
could
possibly
think
any
ill
of
him
i
am
going
there
now
for
my
lesson
i
could
ask
you
to
go
with
me
miss
summerson
but
if
you
would
said
caddy
who
had
said
all
this
earnestly
and
tremblingly
i
should
be
very
glad
very
glad
it
happened
that
we
had
arranged
with
my
guardian
to
go
to
miss
flite
that
day
we
had
told
him
of
our
former
visit
and
our
account
had
interested
him
but
something
had
always
happened
to
prevent
our
going
there
again
as
i
trusted
that
i
might
have
sufficient
influence
with
miss
jellyby
to
prevent
her
taking
any
very
rash
step
if
i
fully
accepted
the
confidence
she
was
so
willing
to
place
in
me
poor
girl
i
proposed
that
she
and
i
and
peepy
should
go
to
the
academy
and
afterwards
meet
my
guardian
and
ada
at
miss
flite
whose
name
i
now
learnt
for
the
first
time
this
was
on
condition
that
miss
jellyby
and
peepy
should
come
back
with
us
to
dinner
the
last
article
of
the
agreement
being
joyfully
acceded
to
by
both
we
smartened
peepy
up
a
little
with
the
assistance
of
a
few
pins
some
soap
and
water
and
a
and
went
out
bending
our
steps
towards
newman
street
which
was
very
near
i
found
the
academy
established
in
a
sufficiently
dingy
house
at
the
corner
of
an
archway
with
busts
in
all
the
staircase
windows
in
the
same
house
there
were
also
established
as
i
gathered
from
the
plates
on
the
door
a
a
there
was
certainly
no
room
for
his
coals
and
a
lithographic
artist
on
the
plate
which
in
size
and
situation
took
precedence
of
all
the
rest
i
read
turveydrop
the
door
was
open
and
the
hall
was
blocked
up
by
a
grand
piano
a
harp
and
several
other
musical
instruments
in
cases
all
in
progress
of
removal
and
all
looking
rakish
in
the
daylight
miss
jellyby
informed
me
that
the
academy
had
been
lent
last
night
for
a
concert
we
went
upstairs
it
had
been
quite
a
fine
house
once
when
it
was
anybody
business
to
keep
it
clean
and
fresh
and
nobody
business
to
smoke
in
it
all
day
and
into
turveydrop
great
room
which
was
built
out
into
a
mews
at
the
back
and
was
lighted
by
a
skylight
it
was
a
bare
resounding
room
smelling
of
stables
with
cane
forms
along
the
walls
and
the
walls
ornamented
at
regular
intervals
with
painted
lyres
and
little
branches
for
candles
which
seemed
to
be
shedding
their
drops
as
other
branches
might
shed
autumn
leaves
several
young
lady
pupils
ranging
from
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
of
age
to
two
or
three
and
twenty
were
assembled
and
i
was
looking
among
them
for
their
instructor
when
caddy
pinching
my
arm
repeated
the
ceremony
of
introduction
miss
summerson
mr
prince
turveydrop
i
curtsied
to
a
little
fair
man
of
youthful
appearance
with
flaxen
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
curling
at
the
ends
all
round
his
head
he
had
a
little
fiddle
which
we
used
to
call
at
school
a
kit
under
his
left
arm
and
its
little
bow
in
the
same
hand
his
little
were
particularly
diminutive
and
he
had
a
little
innocent
feminine
manner
which
not
only
appealed
to
me
in
an
amiable
way
but
made
this
singular
effect
upon
me
that
i
received
the
impression
that
he
was
like
his
mother
and
that
his
mother
had
not
been
much
considered
or
well
used
i
am
very
happy
to
see
miss
jellyby
friend
he
said
bowing
low
to
me
i
began
to
fear
with
timid
tenderness
as
it
was
past
the
usual
time
that
miss
jellyby
was
not
coming
i
beg
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
attribute
that
to
me
who
have
detained
her
and
to
receive
my
excuses
sir
said
i
oh
dear
said
he
and
pray
i
entreated
do
not
allow
me
to
be
the
cause
of
any
more
delay
with
that
apology
i
withdrew
to
a
seat
between
peepy
who
being
well
used
to
it
had
already
climbed
into
a
corner
place
and
an
old
lady
of
a
censorious
countenance
whose
two
nieces
were
in
the
class
and
who
was
very
indignant
with
peepy
boots
prince
turveydrop
then
tinkled
the
strings
of
his
kit
with
his
fingers
and
the
young
ladies
stood
up
to
dance
just
then
there
appeared
from
a
old
turveydrop
in
the
full
lustre
of
his
deportment
he
was
a
fat
old
gentleman
with
a
false
complexion
false
teeth
false
whiskers
and
a
wig
he
had
a
fur
collar
and
he
had
a
padded
breast
to
his
coat
which
only
wanted
a
star
or
a
broad
blue
ribbon
to
be
complete
he
was
pinched
in
and
swelled
out
and
got
up
and
strapped
down
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
bear
he
had
such
a
neckcloth
on
puffing
his
very
eyes
out
of
their
natural
shape
and
his
chin
and
even
his
ears
so
sunk
into
it
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
must
inevitably
double
up
if
it
were
cast
loose
he
had
under
his
arm
a
hat
of
great
size
and
weight
shelving
downward
from
the
crown
to
the
brim
and
in
his
hand
a
pair
of
white
gloves
with
which
he
flapped
it
as
he
stood
poised
on
one
leg
in
a
state
of
elegance
not
to
be
surpassed
he
had
a
cane
he
had
an
he
had
a
he
had
rings
he
had
wristbands
he
had
everything
but
any
touch
of
nature
he
was
not
like
youth
he
was
not
like
age
he
was
not
like
anything
in
the
world
but
a
model
of
deportment
father
a
visitor
miss
jellyby
friend
miss
summerson
distinguished
said
turveydrop
by
miss
summerson
presence
as
he
bowed
to
me
in
that
tight
state
i
almost
believe
i
saw
creases
come
into
the
whites
of
his
eyes
my
father
said
the
son
aside
to
me
with
quite
an
affecting
belief
in
him
is
a
celebrated
character
my
father
is
greatly
admired
go
on
prince
go
on
said
turveydrop
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
waving
his
gloves
condescendingly
go
on
my
son
at
this
command
or
by
this
gracious
permission
the
lesson
went
on
prince
turveydrop
sometimes
played
the
kit
dancing
sometimes
played
the
piano
standing
sometimes
hummed
the
tune
with
what
little
breath
he
could
spare
while
he
set
a
pupil
right
always
conscientiously
moved
with
the
least
proficient
through
every
step
and
every
part
of
the
figure
and
never
rested
for
an
instant
his
distinguished
father
did
nothing
whatever
but
stand
before
the
fire
a
model
of
deportment
and
he
never
does
anything
else
said
the
old
lady
of
the
censorious
countenance
yet
would
you
believe
that
it
his
name
on
the
his
son
name
is
the
same
you
know
said
i
he
would
let
his
son
have
any
name
if
he
could
take
it
from
him
returned
the
old
lady
look
at
the
son
dress
it
certainly
was
plain
threadbare
almost
shabby
yet
the
father
must
be
garnished
and
tricked
out
said
the
old
lady
because
of
his
deportment
deport
him
transport
him
would
be
better
i
felt
curious
to
know
more
concerning
this
person
i
asked
does
he
give
lessons
in
deportment
now
now
returned
the
old
lady
shortly
never
did
after
a
moment
consideration
i
suggested
that
perhaps
fencing
had
been
his
accomplishment
i
do
believe
he
can
fence
at
all
said
the
old
lady
i
looked
surprised
and
inquisitive
the
old
lady
becoming
more
and
more
incensed
against
the
master
of
deportment
as
she
dwelt
upon
the
subject
gave
me
some
particulars
of
his
career
with
strong
assurances
that
they
were
mildly
stated
he
had
married
a
meek
little
with
a
tolerable
connexion
having
never
in
his
life
before
done
anything
but
deport
himself
and
had
worked
her
to
death
or
had
at
the
best
suffered
her
to
work
herself
to
death
to
maintain
him
in
those
expenses
which
were
indispensable
to
his
position
at
once
to
exhibit
his
deportment
to
the
best
models
and
to
keep
the
best
models
constantly
before
himself
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
frequent
all
public
places
of
fashionable
and
lounging
resort
to
be
seen
at
brighton
and
elsewhere
at
fashionable
times
and
to
lead
an
idle
life
in
the
very
best
clothes
to
enable
him
to
do
this
the
affectionate
little
had
toiled
and
laboured
and
would
have
toiled
and
laboured
to
that
hour
if
her
strength
had
lasted
so
long
for
the
mainspring
of
the
story
was
that
in
spite
of
the
man
absorbing
selfishness
his
wife
overpowered
by
his
deportment
had
to
the
last
believed
in
him
and
had
on
her
in
the
most
moving
terms
confided
him
to
their
son
as
one
who
had
an
inextinguishable
claim
upon
him
and
whom
he
could
never
regard
with
too
much
pride
and
deference
the
son
inheriting
his
mother
belief
and
having
the
deportment
always
before
him
had
lived
and
grown
in
the
same
faith
and
now
at
thirty
years
of
age
worked
for
his
father
twelve
hours
a
day
and
looked
up
to
him
with
veneration
on
the
old
imaginary
pinnacle
the
airs
the
fellow
gives
himself
said
my
informant
shaking
her
head
at
old
turveydrop
with
speechless
indignation
as
he
drew
on
his
tight
gloves
of
course
unconscious
of
the
homage
she
was
rendering
he
fully
believes
he
is
one
of
the
aristocracy
and
he
is
so
condescending
to
the
son
he
so
egregiously
deludes
that
you
might
suppose
him
the
most
virtuous
of
parents
oh
said
the
old
lady
apostrophizing
him
with
infinite
vehemence
i
could
bite
you
i
could
not
help
being
amused
though
i
heard
the
old
lady
out
with
feelings
of
real
concern
it
was
difficult
to
doubt
her
with
the
father
and
son
before
me
what
i
might
have
thought
of
them
without
the
old
lady
account
or
what
i
might
have
thought
of
the
old
lady
account
without
them
i
can
not
say
there
was
a
fitness
of
things
in
the
whole
that
carried
conviction
with
it
my
eyes
were
yet
wandering
from
young
turveydrop
working
so
hard
to
old
turveydrop
deporting
himself
so
beautifully
when
the
latter
came
ambling
up
to
me
and
entered
into
conversation
he
asked
me
first
of
all
whether
i
conferred
a
charm
and
a
distinction
on
london
by
residing
in
it
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
reply
that
i
was
perfectly
aware
i
should
not
do
that
in
any
case
but
merely
told
him
where
i
did
reside
a
lady
so
graceful
and
accomplished
he
said
kissing
his
right
glove
and
afterwards
extending
it
towards
the
pupils
will
look
leniently
on
the
deficiencies
here
we
do
our
best
to
polish
polish
polish
he
sat
down
beside
me
taking
some
pains
to
sit
on
the
form
i
thought
in
imitation
of
the
print
of
his
illustrious
model
on
the
sofa
and
really
he
did
look
very
like
it
to
polish
polish
polish
he
repeated
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
gently
fluttering
his
fingers
but
we
are
not
if
i
may
say
so
to
one
formed
to
be
graceful
both
by
nature
and
art
with
the
bow
which
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
make
without
lifting
up
his
eyebrows
and
shutting
his
eyes
we
are
not
what
we
used
to
be
in
point
of
deportment
are
we
not
sir
said
i
we
have
degenerated
he
returned
shaking
his
head
which
he
could
do
to
a
very
limited
extent
in
his
cravat
a
levelling
age
is
not
favourable
to
deportment
it
develops
vulgarity
perhaps
i
speak
with
some
little
partiality
it
may
not
be
for
me
to
say
that
i
have
been
called
for
some
years
now
gentleman
turveydrop
or
that
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
did
me
the
honour
to
inquire
on
my
removing
my
hat
as
he
drove
out
of
the
pavilion
at
brighton
that
fine
building
is
he
who
the
devil
is
he
why
do
i
know
him
why
has
he
thirty
thousand
a
year
but
these
are
little
matters
of
anecdote
the
general
property
still
repeated
occasionally
among
the
upper
classes
indeed
said
i
he
replied
with
the
bow
where
what
is
left
among
us
of
deportment
he
added
still
lingers
england
alas
my
country
has
degenerated
very
much
and
is
degenerating
every
day
she
has
not
many
gentlemen
left
we
are
few
i
see
nothing
to
succeed
us
but
a
race
of
weavers
one
might
hope
that
the
race
of
gentlemen
would
be
perpetuated
here
said
i
you
are
very
good
he
smiled
with
a
bow
again
you
flatter
me
but
no
no
i
have
never
been
able
to
imbue
my
poor
boy
with
that
part
of
his
art
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
disparage
my
dear
child
but
he
has
no
deportment
he
appears
to
be
an
excellent
master
i
observed
understand
me
my
dear
madam
he
is
an
excellent
master
all
that
can
be
acquired
he
has
acquired
all
that
can
be
imparted
he
can
impart
but
there
are
things
he
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
and
made
the
bow
again
as
if
to
add
this
kind
of
thing
for
instance
i
glanced
towards
the
centre
of
the
room
where
miss
jellyby
lover
now
engaged
with
single
pupils
was
undergoing
greater
drudgery
than
ever
my
amiable
child
murmured
turveydrop
adjusting
his
cravat
your
son
is
indefatigable
said
i
it
is
my
reward
said
turveydrop
to
hear
you
say
so
in
some
respects
he
treads
in
the
footsteps
of
his
sainted
mother
she
was
a
devoted
creature
but
wooman
lovely
wooman
said
turveydrop
with
very
disagreeable
gallantry
what
a
sex
you
are
i
rose
and
joined
miss
jellyby
who
was
by
this
time
putting
on
her
bonnet
the
time
allotted
to
a
lesson
having
fully
elapsed
there
was
a
general
putting
on
of
bonnets
when
miss
jellyby
and
the
unfortunate
prince
found
an
opportunity
to
become
betrothed
i
know
but
they
certainly
found
none
on
this
occasion
to
exchange
a
dozen
words
my
dear
said
turveydrop
benignly
to
his
son
do
you
know
the
hour
no
father
the
son
had
no
watch
the
father
had
a
handsome
gold
one
which
he
pulled
out
with
an
air
that
was
an
example
to
mankind
my
son
said
he
it
two
recollect
your
school
at
kensington
at
three
that
time
enough
for
me
father
said
prince
i
can
take
a
morsel
of
dinner
standing
and
be
off
my
dear
boy
returned
his
father
you
must
be
very
quick
you
will
find
the
cold
mutton
on
the
table
thank
you
father
are
you
off
now
father
yes
my
dear
i
suppose
said
turveydrop
shutting
his
eyes
and
lifting
up
his
shoulders
with
modest
consciousness
that
i
must
show
myself
as
usual
about
town
you
had
better
dine
out
comfortably
somewhere
said
his
son
my
dear
child
i
intend
to
i
shall
take
my
little
meal
i
think
at
the
french
house
in
the
opera
colonnade
that
right
father
said
prince
shaking
hands
my
son
bless
you
turveydrop
said
this
in
quite
a
pious
manner
and
it
seemed
to
do
his
son
good
who
in
parting
from
him
was
so
pleased
with
him
so
dutiful
to
him
and
so
proud
of
him
that
i
almost
felt
as
if
it
were
an
unkindness
to
the
younger
man
not
to
be
able
to
believe
implicitly
in
the
elder
the
few
moments
that
were
occupied
by
prince
in
taking
leave
of
us
and
particularly
of
one
of
us
as
i
saw
being
in
the
secret
enhanced
my
favourable
impression
of
his
almost
childish
character
i
felt
a
liking
for
him
and
a
compassion
for
him
as
he
put
his
little
kit
in
his
pocket
and
with
it
his
desire
to
stay
a
little
while
with
caddy
and
went
away
to
his
cold
mutton
and
his
school
at
kensington
that
made
me
scarcely
less
irate
with
his
father
than
the
censorious
old
lady
the
father
opened
the
room
door
for
us
and
bowed
us
out
in
a
manner
i
must
acknowledge
worthy
of
his
shining
original
in
the
same
style
he
presently
passed
us
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
on
his
way
to
the
aristocratic
part
of
the
town
where
he
was
going
to
show
himself
among
the
few
other
gentlemen
left
for
some
moments
i
was
so
lost
in
reconsidering
what
i
had
heard
and
seen
in
newman
street
that
i
was
quite
unable
to
talk
to
caddy
or
even
to
fix
my
attention
on
what
she
said
to
me
especially
when
i
began
to
inquire
in
my
mind
whether
there
were
or
ever
had
been
any
other
gentlemen
not
in
the
dancing
profession
who
lived
and
founded
a
reputation
entirely
on
their
deportment
this
became
so
bewildering
and
suggested
the
possibility
of
so
many
turveydrops
that
i
said
esther
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
abandon
this
subject
altogether
and
attend
to
caddy
i
accordingly
did
so
and
we
chatted
all
the
rest
of
the
way
to
lincoln
inn
caddy
told
me
that
her
lover
education
had
been
so
neglected
that
it
was
not
always
easy
to
read
his
notes
she
said
if
he
were
not
so
anxious
about
his
spelling
and
took
less
pains
to
make
it
clear
he
would
do
better
but
he
put
so
many
unnecessary
letters
into
short
words
that
they
sometimes
quite
lost
their
english
appearance
he
does
it
with
the
best
intention
observed
caddy
but
it
has
the
effect
he
means
poor
fellow
caddy
then
went
on
to
reason
how
could
he
be
expected
to
be
a
scholar
when
he
had
passed
his
whole
life
in
the
and
had
done
nothing
but
teach
and
fag
fag
and
teach
morning
noon
and
night
and
what
did
it
matter
she
could
write
letters
enough
for
both
as
she
knew
to
her
cost
and
it
was
far
better
for
him
to
be
amiable
than
learned
besides
it
not
as
if
i
was
an
accomplished
girl
who
had
any
right
to
give
herself
airs
said
caddy
i
know
little
enough
i
am
sure
thanks
to
ma
there
another
thing
i
want
to
tell
you
now
we
are
alone
continued
caddy
which
i
should
not
have
liked
to
mention
unless
you
had
seen
prince
miss
summerson
you
know
what
a
house
ours
is
of
no
use
my
trying
to
learn
anything
that
it
would
be
useful
for
prince
wife
to
know
in
our
house
we
live
in
such
a
state
of
muddle
that
it
impossible
and
i
have
only
been
more
disheartened
whenever
i
have
tried
so
i
get
a
little
practice
with
who
do
you
think
poor
miss
flite
early
in
the
morning
i
help
her
to
tidy
her
room
and
clean
her
birds
and
i
make
her
cup
of
coffee
for
her
of
course
she
taught
me
and
i
have
learnt
to
make
it
so
well
that
prince
says
it
the
very
best
coffee
he
ever
tasted
and
would
quite
delight
old
turveydrop
who
is
very
particular
indeed
about
his
coffee
i
can
make
little
puddings
too
and
i
know
how
to
buy
neck
of
mutton
and
tea
and
sugar
and
butter
and
a
good
many
housekeeping
things
i
am
not
clever
at
my
needle
yet
said
caddy
glancing
at
the
repairs
on
peepy
frock
but
perhaps
i
shall
improve
and
since
i
have
been
engaged
to
prince
and
have
been
doing
all
this
i
have
felt
i
hope
and
more
forgiving
to
ma
it
rather
put
me
out
at
first
this
morning
to
see
you
and
miss
clare
looking
so
neat
and
pretty
and
to
feel
ashamed
of
peepy
and
myself
too
but
on
the
whole
i
hope
i
am
than
i
was
and
more
forgiving
to
ma
the
poor
girl
trying
so
hard
said
it
from
her
heart
and
touched
mine
caddy
my
love
i
replied
i
begin
to
have
a
great
affection
for
you
and
i
hope
we
shall
become
friends
oh
do
you
cried
caddy
how
happy
that
would
make
me
my
dear
caddy
said
i
let
us
be
friends
from
this
time
and
let
us
often
have
a
chat
about
these
matters
and
try
to
find
the
right
way
through
them
caddy
was
overjoyed
i
said
everything
i
could
in
my
way
to
comfort
and
encourage
her
and
i
would
not
have
objected
to
old
turveydrop
that
day
for
any
smaller
consideration
than
a
settlement
on
his
by
this
time
we
were
come
to
krook
whose
private
door
stood
open
there
was
a
bill
pasted
on
the
announcing
a
room
to
let
on
the
second
floor
it
reminded
caddy
to
tell
me
as
we
proceeded
upstairs
that
there
had
been
a
sudden
death
there
and
an
inquest
and
that
our
little
friend
had
been
ill
of
the
fright
the
door
and
window
of
the
vacant
room
being
open
we
looked
in
it
was
the
room
with
the
dark
door
to
which
miss
flite
had
secretly
directed
my
attention
when
i
was
last
in
the
house
a
sad
and
desolate
place
it
was
a
gloomy
sorrowful
place
that
gave
me
a
strange
sensation
of
mournfulness
and
even
dread
you
look
pale
said
caddy
when
we
came
out
and
cold
i
felt
as
if
the
room
had
chilled
me
we
had
walked
slowly
while
we
were
talking
and
my
guardian
and
ada
were
here
before
us
we
found
them
in
miss
flite
garret
they
were
looking
at
the
birds
while
a
medical
gentleman
who
was
so
good
as
to
attend
miss
flite
with
much
solicitude
and
compassion
spoke
with
her
cheerfully
by
the
fire
i
have
finished
my
professional
visit
he
said
coming
forward
miss
flite
is
much
better
and
may
appear
in
court
as
her
mind
is
set
upon
it
she
has
been
greatly
missed
there
i
understand
miss
flite
received
the
compliment
with
complacency
and
dropped
a
general
curtsy
to
us
honoured
indeed
said
she
by
another
visit
from
the
wards
in
jarndyce
happy
to
receive
jarndyce
of
bleak
house
beneath
my
humble
roof
with
a
special
curtsy
my
dear
she
had
bestowed
that
name
on
caddy
it
appeared
and
always
called
her
by
it
a
double
welcome
has
she
been
very
ill
asked
jarndyce
of
the
gentleman
whom
we
had
found
in
attendance
on
her
she
answered
for
herself
directly
though
he
had
put
the
question
in
a
whisper
oh
decidedly
unwell
oh
very
unwell
indeed
she
said
confidentially
not
pain
you
know
trouble
not
bodily
so
much
as
nervous
nervous
the
truth
is
in
a
subdued
voice
and
trembling
we
have
had
death
here
there
was
poison
in
the
house
i
am
very
susceptible
to
such
horrid
things
it
frightened
me
only
woodcourt
knows
how
much
my
physician
mr
woodcourt
with
great
stateliness
the
wards
in
jarndyce
jarndyce
of
bleak
house
miss
flite
said
woodcourt
in
a
grave
kind
of
voice
as
if
he
were
appealing
to
her
while
speaking
to
us
and
laying
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm
miss
flite
describes
her
illness
with
her
usual
accuracy
she
was
alarmed
by
an
occurrence
in
the
house
which
might
have
alarmed
a
stronger
person
and
was
made
ill
by
the
distress
and
agitation
she
brought
me
here
in
the
first
hurry
of
the
discovery
though
too
late
for
me
to
be
of
any
use
to
the
unfortunate
man
i
have
compensated
myself
for
that
disappointment
by
coming
here
since
and
being
of
some
small
use
to
her
the
kindest
physician
in
the
college
whispered
miss
flite
to
me
i
expect
a
judgment
on
the
day
of
judgment
and
shall
then
confer
estates
she
will
be
as
well
in
a
day
or
two
said
woodcourt
looking
at
her
with
an
observant
smile
as
she
ever
will
be
in
other
words
quite
well
of
course
have
you
heard
of
her
good
fortune
most
extraordinary
said
miss
flite
smiling
brightly
you
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
my
dear
every
saturday
conversation
kenge
or
guppy
clerk
to
conversation
places
in
my
hand
a
paper
of
shillings
shillings
i
assure
you
always
the
same
number
in
the
paper
always
one
for
every
day
in
the
week
now
you
know
really
so
is
it
not
from
whence
do
these
papers
come
you
say
that
is
the
great
question
naturally
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
think
said
miss
flite
drawing
herself
back
with
a
very
shrewd
look
and
shaking
her
right
forefinger
in
a
most
significant
manner
that
the
lord
chancellor
aware
of
the
length
of
time
during
which
the
great
seal
has
been
open
for
it
has
been
open
a
long
time
forwards
them
until
the
judgment
i
expect
is
given
now
that
very
creditable
you
know
to
confess
in
that
way
that
he
is
a
little
slow
for
human
life
so
delicate
attending
court
the
other
day
i
attend
it
regularly
with
my
documents
i
taxed
him
with
it
and
he
almost
confessed
that
is
i
smiled
at
him
from
my
bench
and
he
smiled
at
me
from
his
bench
but
it
great
good
fortune
is
it
not
and
lays
the
money
out
for
me
to
great
advantage
oh
i
assure
you
to
the
greatest
advantage
i
congratulated
her
as
she
addressed
herself
to
me
upon
this
fortunate
addition
to
her
income
and
wished
her
a
long
continuance
of
it
i
did
not
speculate
upon
the
source
from
which
it
came
or
wonder
whose
humanity
was
so
considerate
my
guardian
stood
before
me
contemplating
the
birds
and
i
had
no
need
to
look
beyond
him
and
what
do
you
call
these
little
fellows
said
he
in
his
pleasant
voice
have
they
any
names
i
can
answer
for
miss
flite
that
they
have
said
i
for
she
promised
to
tell
us
what
they
were
ada
remembers
ada
remembered
very
well
did
i
said
miss
flite
who
that
at
my
door
what
are
you
listening
at
my
door
for
krook
the
old
man
of
the
house
pushing
it
open
before
him
appeared
there
with
his
fur
cap
in
his
hand
and
his
cat
at
his
heels
i
war
listening
miss
flite
he
said
i
was
going
to
give
a
rap
with
my
knuckles
only
you
so
quick
make
your
cat
go
down
drive
her
away
the
old
lady
angrily
exclaimed
bah
bah
there
ai
no
danger
gentlefolks
said
krook
looking
slowly
and
sharply
from
one
to
another
until
he
had
looked
at
all
of
us
she
never
offer
at
the
birds
when
i
was
here
unless
i
told
her
to
it
you
will
excuse
my
landlord
said
the
old
lady
with
a
dignified
air
m
quite
m
what
do
you
want
krook
when
i
have
company
hi
said
the
old
man
you
know
i
am
the
chancellor
well
returned
miss
flite
what
of
that
for
the
chancellor
said
the
old
man
with
a
chuckle
not
to
be
acquainted
with
a
jarndyce
is
queer
ai
it
miss
flite
might
i
take
the
liberty
your
servant
sir
i
know
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
as
well
as
you
do
sir
i
knowed
old
squire
tom
sir

never

my
knowledge

though
not
even
in

yet
i
go
there
a
mortal
sight
of
times
in
the
course
of
the
year
taking
one
day
with
another
i
never
go
there
said
jarndyce
which
he
never
did
on
any
consideration
i
would
sooner
go
somewhere
else
would
you
though
returned
krook
grinning
you
bearing
hard
upon
my
noble
and
learned
brother
in
your
meaning

though
perhaps
it
is
but
in
a
jarndyce
the
burnt
child
sir
what
you
looking
at
my
lodger
birds
mr
jarndyce
the
old
man
had
come
by
little
and
little
into
the
room
until
he
now
touched
my
guardian
with
his
elbow
and
looked
close
up
into
his
face
with
his
spectacled
eyes
it
one
of
her
strange
ways
that
she
never
tell
the
names
of
these
birds
if
she
can
help
it
though
she
named
all
this
was
in
a
whisper
shall
i
run
over
flite
he
asked
aloud
winking
at
us
and
pointing
at
her
as
she
turned
away
affecting
to
sweep
the
grate
if
you
like
she
answered
hurriedly
the
old
man
looking
up
at
the
cages
after
another
look
at
us
went
through
the
list
hope
joy
youth
peace
rest
life
dust
ashes

want
ruin
despair
madness
death
cunning
folly
words
wigs

the
whole
collection
said
the
old
man
all
cooped
up
together
by
my
noble
and
learned
brother
this
is
a
bitter
wind
muttered
my
guardian
when
my
noble
and
learned
brother
gives
his
judgment
they
to
be
let
go
free
said
krook
winking
at
us
again
and
then
he
added
whispering
and
grinning
if
that
ever
was
to
happen
which
it
wo
the
birds
that
have
never
been
caged
would
kill
if
ever
the
wind
was
in
the
east
said
my
guardian
pretending
to
look
out
of
the
window
for
a
weathercock
i
think
it
there
we
found
it
very
difficult
to
get
away
from
the
house
it
was
not
miss
flite
who
detained
us
she
was
as
reasonable
a
little
creature
in
consulting
the
convenience
of
others
as
there
possibly
could
be
it
was
krook
he
seemed
unable
to
detach
himself
from
jarndyce
if
he
had
been
linked
to
him
he
could
hardly
have
attended
him
more
closely
he
proposed
to
show
us
his
court
of
chancery
and
all
the
strange
medley
it
contained
during
the
whole
of
our
inspection
prolonged
by
himself
he
kept
close
to
jarndyce
and
sometimes
detained
him
under
one
pretence
or
other
until
we
had
passed
on
as
if
he
were
tormented
by
an
inclination
to
enter
upon
some
secret
subject
which
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
approach
i
can
not
imagine
a
countenance
and
manner
more
singularly
expressive
of
caution
and
indecision
and
a
perpetual
impulse
to
do
something
he
could
not
resolve
to
venture
on
than
krook
was
that
day
his
watchfulness
of
my
guardian
was
incessant
he
rarely
removed
his
eyes
from
his
face
if
he
went
on
beside
him
he
observed
him
with
the
slyness
of
an
old
white
fox
if
he
went
before
he
looked
back
when
we
stood
still
he
got
opposite
to
him
and
drawing
his
hand
across
and
across
his
open
mouth
with
a
curious
expression
of
a
sense
of
power
and
turning
up
his
eyes
and
lowering
his
grey
eyebrows
until
they
appeared
to
be
shut
seemed
to
scan
every
lineament
of
his
face
at
last
having
been
always
attended
by
the
cat
all
over
the
house
and
having
seen
the
whole
stock
of
miscellaneous
lumber
which
was
certainly
curious
we
came
into
the
back
part
of
the
shop
here
on
the
head
of
an
empty
barrel
stood
on
end
were
an
some
old
stumps
of
pens
and
some
dirty
playbills
and
against
the
wall
were
pasted
several
large
printed
alphabets
in
several
plain
hands
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
my
guardian
trying
to
learn
myself
to
read
and
write
said
krook
and
how
do
you
get
on
slow
bad
returned
the
old
man
impatiently
it
hard
at
my
time
of
life
it
would
be
easier
to
be
taught
by
some
one
said
my
guardian
aye
but
they
might
teach
me
wrong
returned
the
old
man
with
a
wonderfully
suspicious
flash
of
his
eye
i
do
know
what
i
may
have
lost
by
not
being
learned
afore
i
would
like
to
lose
anything
by
being
learned
wrong
now
wrong
said
my
guardian
with
his
smile
who
do
you
suppose
would
teach
you
wrong
i
do
know
jarndyce
of
bleak
house
replied
the
old
man
turning
up
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
and
rubbing
his
hands
i
do
suppose
as
anybody
would
but
i
rather
trust
my
own
self
than
another
these
answers
and
his
manner
were
strange
enough
to
cause
my
guardian
to
inquire
of
woodcourt
as
we
all
walked
across
lincoln
inn
together
whether
krook
were
really
as
his
lodger
represented
him
deranged
the
young
surgeon
replied
no
he
had
seen
no
reason
to
think
so
he
was
exceedingly
distrustful
as
ignorance
usually
was
and
he
was
always
more
or
less
under
the
influence
of
raw
gin
of
which
he
drank
great
quantities
and
of
which
he
and
his
as
we
might
have
observed
smelt
strongly
but
he
did
not
think
him
mad
as
yet
on
our
way
home
i
so
conciliated
peepy
affections
by
buying
him
a
windmill
and
two
that
he
would
suffer
nobody
else
to
take
off
his
hat
and
gloves
and
would
sit
nowhere
at
dinner
but
at
my
side
caddy
sat
upon
the
other
side
of
me
next
to
ada
to
whom
we
imparted
the
whole
history
of
the
engagement
as
soon
as
we
got
back
we
made
much
of
caddy
and
peepy
too
and
caddy
brightened
exceedingly
and
my
guardian
was
as
merry
as
we
were
and
we
were
all
very
happy
indeed
until
caddy
went
home
at
night
in
a
with
peepy
fast
asleep
but
holding
tight
to
the
windmill
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
at
least
i
have
not
mentioned
that
woodcourt
was
the
same
dark
young
surgeon
whom
we
had
met
at
badger
or
that
jarndyce
invited
him
to
dinner
that
day
or
that
he
came
or
that
when
they
were
all
gone
and
i
said
to
ada
now
my
darling
let
us
have
a
little
talk
about
richard
ada
laughed
and
said
but
i
do
think
it
matters
what
my
darling
said
she
was
always
merry
chapter
xv
bell
yard
while
we
were
in
london
jarndyce
was
constantly
beset
by
the
crowd
of
excitable
ladies
and
gentlemen
whose
proceedings
had
so
much
astonished
us
quale
who
presented
himself
soon
after
our
arrival
was
in
all
such
excitements
he
seemed
to
project
those
two
shining
knobs
of
temples
of
his
into
everything
that
went
on
and
to
brush
his
hair
farther
and
farther
back
until
the
very
roots
were
almost
ready
to
fly
out
of
his
head
in
inappeasable
philanthropy
all
objects
were
alike
to
him
but
he
was
always
particularly
ready
for
anything
in
the
way
of
a
testimonial
to
any
one
his
great
power
seemed
to
be
his
power
of
indiscriminate
admiration
he
would
sit
for
any
length
of
time
with
the
utmost
enjoyment
bathing
his
temples
in
the
light
of
any
order
of
luminary
having
first
seen
him
perfectly
swallowed
up
in
admiration
of
jellyby
i
had
supposed
her
to
be
the
absorbing
object
of
his
devotion
i
soon
discovered
my
mistake
and
found
him
to
be
and
to
a
whole
procession
of
people
pardiggle
came
one
day
for
a
subscription
to
something
and
with
her
quale
whatever
pardiggle
said
quale
repeated
to
us
and
just
as
he
had
drawn
jellyby
out
he
drew
pardiggle
out
pardiggle
wrote
a
letter
of
introduction
to
my
guardian
in
behalf
of
her
eloquent
friend
gusher
with
gusher
appeared
quale
again
gusher
being
a
flabby
gentleman
with
a
moist
surface
and
eyes
so
much
too
small
for
his
moon
of
a
face
that
they
seemed
to
have
been
originally
made
for
somebody
else
was
not
at
first
sight
prepossessing
yet
he
was
scarcely
seated
before
quale
asked
ada
and
me
not
inaudibly
whether
he
was
not
a
great
creature
which
he
certainly
was
flabbily
speaking
though
quale
meant
in
intellectual
beauty
and
whether
we
were
not
struck
by
his
massive
configuration
of
brow
in
short
we
heard
of
a
great
many
missions
of
various
sorts
among
this
set
of
people
but
nothing
respecting
them
was
half
so
clear
to
us
as
that
it
was
mission
to
be
in
ecstasies
with
everybody
else
mission
and
that
it
was
the
most
popular
mission
of
all
jarndyce
had
fallen
into
this
company
in
the
tenderness
of
his
heart
and
his
earnest
desire
to
do
all
the
good
in
his
power
but
that
he
felt
it
to
be
too
often
an
unsatisfactory
company
where
benevolence
took
spasmodic
forms
where
charity
was
assumed
as
a
regular
uniform
by
loud
professors
and
speculators
in
cheap
notoriety
vehement
in
profession
restless
and
vain
in
action
servile
in
the
last
degree
of
meanness
to
the
great
adulatory
of
one
another
and
intolerable
to
those
who
were
anxious
quietly
to
help
the
weak
from
failing
rather
than
with
a
great
deal
of
bluster
and
to
raise
them
up
a
little
way
when
they
were
down
he
plainly
told
us
when
a
testimonial
was
originated
to
quale
by
gusher
who
had
already
got
one
originated
by
quale
and
when
gusher
spoke
for
an
hour
and
a
half
on
the
subject
to
a
meeting
including
two
charity
schools
of
small
boys
and
girls
who
were
specially
reminded
of
the
widow
mite
and
requested
to
come
forward
with
halfpence
and
be
acceptable
sacrifices
i
think
the
wind
was
in
the
east
for
three
whole
weeks
i
mention
this
because
i
am
coming
to
skimpole
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
professions
of
childishness
and
carelessness
were
a
great
relief
to
my
guardian
by
contrast
with
such
things
and
were
the
more
readily
believed
in
since
to
find
one
perfectly
undesigning
and
candid
man
among
many
opposites
could
not
fail
to
give
him
pleasure
i
should
be
sorry
to
imply
that
skimpole
divined
this
and
was
politic
i
really
never
understood
him
well
enough
to
know
what
he
was
to
my
guardian
he
certainly
was
to
the
rest
of
the
world
he
had
not
been
very
well
and
thus
though
he
lived
in
london
we
had
seen
nothing
of
him
until
now
he
appeared
one
morning
in
his
usual
agreeable
way
and
as
full
of
pleasant
spirits
as
ever
well
he
said
here
he
was
he
had
been
bilious
but
rich
men
were
often
bilious
and
therefore
he
had
been
persuading
himself
that
he
was
a
man
of
property
so
he
was
in
a
certain
point
of
view
in
his
expansive
intentions
he
had
been
enriching
his
medical
attendant
in
the
most
lavish
manner
he
had
always
doubled
and
sometimes
quadrupled
his
fees
he
had
said
to
the
doctor
now
my
dear
doctor
it
is
quite
a
delusion
on
your
part
to
suppose
that
you
attend
me
for
nothing
i
am
overwhelming
you
with
money
in
my
expansive
intentions
if
you
only
knew
it
and
really
he
said
he
meant
it
to
that
degree
that
he
thought
it
much
the
same
as
doing
it
if
he
had
had
those
bits
of
metal
or
thin
paper
to
which
mankind
attached
so
much
importance
to
put
in
the
doctor
hand
he
would
have
put
them
in
the
doctor
hand
not
having
them
he
substituted
the
will
for
the
deed
very
well
if
he
really
meant
it
if
his
will
were
genuine
and
real
which
it
was
it
appeared
to
him
that
it
was
the
same
as
coin
and
cancelled
the
obligation
it
may
be
partly
because
i
know
nothing
of
the
value
of
money
said
skimpole
but
i
often
feel
this
it
seems
so
reasonable
my
butcher
says
to
me
he
wants
that
little
bill
it
a
part
of
the
pleasant
unconscious
poetry
of
the
man
nature
that
he
always
calls
it
a
bill
to
make
the
payment
appear
easy
to
both
of
us
i
reply
to
the
butcher
good
friend
if
you
knew
it
you
are
paid
you
have
had
the
trouble
of
coming
to
ask
for
the
little
bill
you
are
paid
i
mean
it
but
suppose
said
my
guardian
laughing
he
had
meant
the
meat
in
the
bill
instead
of
providing
it
my
dear
jarndyce
he
returned
you
surprise
me
you
take
the
butcher
position
a
butcher
i
once
dealt
with
occupied
that
very
ground
says
he
why
did
you
eat
spring
lamb
at
eighteen
pence
a
pound
did
i
eat
spring
lamb
at
eighteen
pence
a
pound
my
honest
friend
said
i
naturally
amazed
by
the
question
like
spring
lamb
this
was
so
far
convincing
sir
says
he
wish
i
had
meant
the
lamb
as
you
mean
the
money
good
fellow
said
i
let
us
reason
like
intellectual
beings
how
could
that
be
it
was
impossible
you
had
got
the
lamb
and
i
have
not
got
the
money
you
could
really
mean
the
lamb
without
sending
it
in
whereas
i
can
and
do
really
mean
the
money
without
paying
it
he
had
not
a
word
there
was
an
end
of
the
subject
did
he
take
no
legal
proceedings
inquired
my
guardian
yes
he
took
legal
proceedings
said
skimpole
but
in
that
he
was
influenced
by
passion
not
by
reason
passion
reminds
me
of
boythorn
he
writes
me
that
you
and
the
ladies
have
promised
him
a
short
visit
at
his
in
lincolnshire
he
is
a
great
favourite
with
my
girls
said
jarndyce
and
i
have
promised
for
them
nature
forgot
to
shade
him
off
i
think
observed
skimpole
to
ada
and
me
a
little
too
boisterous
like
the
sea
a
little
too
vehement
like
a
bull
who
has
made
up
his
mind
to
consider
every
colour
scarlet
but
i
grant
a
sort
of
merit
in
him
i
should
have
been
surprised
if
those
two
could
have
thought
very
highly
of
one
another
boythorn
attaching
so
much
importance
to
many
things
and
skimpole
caring
so
little
for
anything
besides
which
i
had
noticed
boythorn
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
into
some
strong
opinion
when
skimpole
was
referred
to
of
course
i
merely
joined
ada
in
saying
that
we
had
been
greatly
pleased
with
him
he
has
invited
me
said
skimpole
and
if
a
child
may
trust
himself
in
such
hands
which
the
present
child
is
encouraged
to
do
with
the
united
tenderness
of
two
angels
to
guard
him
i
shall
go
he
proposes
to
frank
me
down
and
back
again
i
suppose
it
will
cost
money
shillings
perhaps
or
pounds
or
something
of
that
sort
by
the
by
coavinses
you
remember
our
friend
coavinses
miss
summerson
he
asked
me
as
the
subject
arose
in
his
mind
in
his
graceful
manner
and
without
the
least
embarrassment
oh
yes
said
i
coavinses
has
been
arrested
by
the
great
bailiff
said
skimpole
he
will
never
do
violence
to
the
sunshine
any
more
it
quite
shocked
me
to
hear
it
for
i
had
already
recalled
with
anything
but
a
serious
association
the
image
of
the
man
sitting
on
the
sofa
that
night
wiping
his
head
his
successor
informed
me
of
it
yesterday
said
skimpole
his
successor
is
in
my
house
now
in
possession
i
think
he
calls
it
he
came
yesterday
on
my
daughter
birthday
i
put
it
to
him
is
unreasonable
and
inconvenient
if
you
had
a
daughter
you
would
like
me
to
come
uninvited
on
her
birthday
but
he
stayed
skimpole
laughed
at
the
pleasant
absurdity
and
lightly
touched
the
piano
by
which
he
was
seated
and
he
told
me
he
said
playing
little
chords
where
i
shall
put
full
stops
the
coavinses
had
left
three
children
no
mother
and
that
coavinses
profession
being
unpopular
the
rising
coavinses
were
at
a
considerable
disadvantage
jarndyce
got
up
rubbing
his
head
and
began
to
walk
about
skimpole
played
the
melody
of
one
of
ada
favourite
songs
ada
and
i
both
looked
at
jarndyce
thinking
that
we
knew
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
after
walking
and
stopping
and
several
times
leaving
off
rubbing
his
head
and
beginning
again
my
guardian
put
his
hand
upon
the
keys
and
stopped
skimpole
playing
i
do
like
this
skimpole
he
said
thoughtfully
skimpole
who
had
quite
forgotten
the
subject
looked
up
surprised
the
man
was
necessary
pursued
my
guardian
walking
backward
and
forward
in
the
very
short
space
between
the
piano
and
the
end
of
the
room
and
rubbing
his
hair
up
from
the
back
of
his
head
as
if
a
high
east
wind
had
blown
it
into
that
form
if
we
make
such
men
necessary
by
our
faults
and
follies
or
by
our
want
of
worldly
knowledge
or
by
our
misfortunes
we
must
not
revenge
ourselves
upon
them
there
was
no
harm
in
his
trade
he
maintained
his
children
one
would
like
to
know
more
about
this
oh
coavinses
cried
skimpole
at
length
perceiving
what
he
meant
nothing
easier
a
walk
to
coavinses
headquarters
and
you
can
know
what
you
will
jarndyce
nodded
to
us
who
were
only
waiting
for
the
signal
come
we
will
walk
that
way
my
dears
why
not
that
way
as
soon
as
another
we
were
quickly
ready
and
went
out
skimpole
went
with
us
and
quite
enjoyed
the
expedition
it
was
so
new
and
so
refreshing
he
said
for
him
to
want
coavinses
instead
of
coavinses
wanting
him
he
took
us
first
to
cursitor
street
chancery
lane
where
there
was
a
house
with
barred
windows
which
he
called
coavinses
castle
on
our
going
into
the
entry
and
ringing
a
bell
a
very
hideous
boy
came
out
of
a
sort
of
office
and
looked
at
us
over
a
spiked
wicket
who
did
you
want
said
the
boy
fitting
two
of
the
spikes
into
his
chin
there
was
a
follower
or
an
officer
or
something
here
said
jarndyce
who
is
dead
yes
said
the
boy
well
i
want
to
know
his
name
if
you
please
name
of
neckett
said
the
boy
and
his
address
bell
yard
said
the
boy
chandler
shop
left
hand
side
name
of
blinder
was
he
i
do
know
how
to
shape
the
question
murmured
my
guardian
industrious
was
neckett
said
the
boy
yes
wery
much
so
he
was
never
tired
of
watching
he
set
upon
a
post
at
a
street
corner
eight
or
ten
hours
at
a
stretch
if
he
undertook
to
do
it
he
might
have
done
worse
i
heard
my
guardian
soliloquize
he
might
have
undertaken
to
do
it
and
not
done
it
thank
you
that
all
i
want
we
left
the
boy
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
arms
on
the
gate
fondling
and
sucking
the
spikes
and
went
back
to
lincoln
inn
where
skimpole
who
had
not
cared
to
remain
nearer
coavinses
awaited
us
then
we
all
went
to
bell
yard
a
narrow
alley
at
a
very
short
distance
we
soon
found
the
chandler
shop
in
it
was
a
old
woman
with
a
dropsy
or
an
asthma
or
perhaps
both
neckett
children
said
she
in
reply
to
my
inquiry
yes
surely
miss
three
pair
if
you
please
door
right
opposite
the
stairs
and
she
handed
me
the
key
across
the
counter
i
glanced
at
the
key
and
glanced
at
her
but
she
took
it
for
granted
that
i
knew
what
to
do
with
it
as
it
could
only
be
intended
for
the
children
door
i
came
out
without
asking
any
more
questions
and
led
the
way
up
the
dark
stairs
we
went
as
quietly
as
we
could
but
four
of
us
made
some
noise
on
the
aged
boards
and
when
we
came
to
the
second
story
we
found
we
had
disturbed
a
man
who
was
standing
there
looking
out
of
his
room
is
it
gridley
that
wanted
he
said
fixing
his
eyes
on
me
with
an
angry
stare
no
sir
said
i
i
am
going
higher
up
he
looked
at
ada
and
at
jarndyce
and
at
skimpole
fixing
the
same
angry
stare
on
each
in
succession
as
they
passed
and
followed
me
jarndyce
gave
him
good
day
good
day
he
said
abruptly
and
fiercely
he
was
a
tall
sallow
man
with
a
careworn
head
on
which
but
little
hair
remained
a
deeply
lined
face
and
prominent
eyes
he
had
a
combative
look
and
a
chafing
irritable
manner
which
associated
with
his
figure
still
large
and
powerful
though
evidently
in
its
decline
rather
alarmed
me
he
had
a
pen
in
his
hand
and
in
the
glimpse
i
caught
of
his
room
in
passing
i
saw
that
it
was
covered
with
a
litter
of
papers
leaving
him
standing
there
we
went
up
to
the
top
room
i
tapped
at
the
door
and
a
little
shrill
voice
inside
said
we
are
locked
in
blinder
got
the
key
i
applied
the
key
on
hearing
this
and
opened
the
door
in
a
poor
room
with
a
sloping
ceiling
and
containing
very
little
furniture
was
a
mite
of
a
boy
some
five
or
six
years
old
nursing
and
hushing
a
heavy
child
of
eighteen
months
there
was
no
fire
though
the
weather
was
cold
both
children
were
wrapped
in
some
poor
shawls
and
tippets
as
a
substitute
their
clothing
was
not
so
warm
however
but
that
their
noses
looked
red
and
pinched
and
their
small
figures
shrunken
as
the
boy
walked
up
and
down
nursing
and
hushing
the
child
with
its
head
on
his
shoulder
who
has
locked
you
up
here
alone
we
naturally
asked
charley
said
the
boy
standing
still
to
gaze
at
us
is
charley
your
brother
no
she
my
sister
charlotte
father
called
her
charley
are
there
any
more
of
you
besides
charley
me
said
the
boy
and
emma
patting
the
limp
bonnet
of
the
child
he
was
nursing
and
charley
where
is
charley
now
out
said
the
boy
beginning
to
walk
up
and
down
again
and
taking
the
nankeen
bonnet
much
too
near
the
bedstead
by
trying
to
gaze
at
us
at
the
same
time
we
were
looking
at
one
another
and
at
these
two
children
when
there
came
into
the
room
a
very
little
girl
childish
in
figure
but
shrewd
and
in
the
face
too
wearing
a
womanly
sort
of
bonnet
much
too
large
for
her
and
drying
her
bare
arms
on
a
womanly
sort
of
apron
her
fingers
were
white
and
wrinkled
with
washing
and
the
were
yet
smoking
which
she
wiped
off
her
arms
but
for
this
she
might
have
been
a
child
playing
at
washing
and
imitating
a
poor
with
a
quick
observation
of
the
truth
she
had
come
running
from
some
place
in
the
neighbourhood
and
had
made
all
the
haste
she
could
consequently
though
she
was
very
light
she
was
out
of
breath
and
could
not
speak
at
first
as
she
stood
panting
and
wiping
her
arms
and
looking
quietly
at
us
oh
here
charley
said
the
boy
the
child
he
was
nursing
stretched
forth
its
arms
and
cried
out
to
be
taken
by
charley
the
little
girl
took
it
in
a
womanly
sort
of
manner
belonging
to
the
apron
and
the
bonnet
and
stood
looking
at
us
over
the
burden
that
clung
to
her
most
affectionately
is
it
possible
whispered
my
guardian
as
we
put
a
chair
for
the
little
creature
and
got
her
to
sit
down
with
her
load
the
boy
keeping
close
to
her
holding
to
her
apron
that
this
child
works
for
the
rest
look
at
this
for
god
sake
look
at
this
it
was
a
thing
to
look
at
the
three
children
close
together
and
two
of
them
relying
solely
on
the
third
and
the
third
so
young
and
yet
with
an
air
of
age
and
steadiness
that
sat
so
strangely
on
the
childish
figure
charley
charley
said
my
guardian
how
old
are
you
over
thirteen
sir
replied
the
child
oh
what
a
great
age
said
my
guardian
what
a
great
age
charley
i
can
not
describe
the
tenderness
with
which
he
spoke
to
her
half
playfully
yet
all
the
more
compassionately
and
mournfully
and
do
you
live
alone
here
with
these
babies
charley
said
my
guardian
yes
sir
returned
the
child
looking
up
into
his
face
with
perfect
confidence
since
father
died
and
how
do
you
live
charley
oh
charley
said
my
guardian
turning
his
face
away
for
a
moment
how
do
you
live
since
father
died
sir
i
gone
out
to
work
i
out
washing
god
help
you
charley
said
my
guardian
you
not
tall
enough
to
reach
the
tub
in
pattens
i
am
sir
she
said
quickly
i
got
a
high
pair
as
belonged
to
mother
and
when
did
mother
die
poor
mother
mother
died
just
after
emma
was
born
said
the
child
glancing
at
the
face
upon
her
bosom
then
father
said
i
was
to
be
as
good
a
mother
to
her
as
i
could
and
so
i
tried
and
so
i
worked
at
home
and
did
cleaning
and
nursing
and
washing
for
a
long
time
before
i
began
to
go
out
and
that
how
i
know
how
do
you
see
sir
and
do
you
often
go
out
as
often
as
i
can
said
charley
opening
her
eyes
and
smiling
because
of
earning
sixpences
and
shillings
and
do
you
always
lock
the
babies
up
when
you
go
out
to
keep
safe
sir
do
you
see
said
charley
blinder
comes
up
now
and
then
and
gridley
comes
up
sometimes
and
perhaps
i
can
run
in
sometimes
and
they
can
play
you
know
and
tom
a
afraid
of
being
locked
up
are
you
tom
said
tom
stoutly
when
it
comes
on
dark
the
lamps
are
lighted
down
in
the
court
and
they
show
up
here
quite
bright
almost
quite
bright
do
they
tom
yes
charley
said
tom
almost
quite
bright
then
he
as
good
as
gold
said
the
little
creature
oh
in
such
a
motherly
womanly
way
and
when
emma
tired
he
puts
her
to
bed
and
when
he
tired
he
goes
to
bed
himself
and
when
i
come
home
and
light
the
candle
and
has
a
bit
of
supper
he
sits
up
again
and
has
it
with
me
do
you
tom
oh
yes
charley
said
tom
that
i
do
and
either
in
this
glimpse
of
the
great
pleasure
of
his
life
or
in
gratitude
and
love
for
charley
who
was
all
in
all
to
him
he
laid
his
face
among
the
scanty
folds
of
her
frock
and
passed
from
laughing
into
crying
it
was
the
first
time
since
our
entry
that
a
tear
had
been
shed
among
these
children
the
little
orphan
girl
had
spoken
of
their
father
and
their
mother
as
if
all
that
sorrow
were
subdued
by
the
necessity
of
taking
courage
and
by
her
childish
importance
in
being
able
to
work
and
by
her
bustling
busy
way
but
now
when
tom
cried
although
she
sat
quite
tranquil
looking
quietly
at
us
and
did
not
by
any
movement
disturb
a
hair
of
the
head
of
either
of
her
little
charges
i
saw
two
silent
tears
fall
down
her
face
i
stood
at
the
window
with
ada
pretending
to
look
at
the
housetops
and
the
blackened
stack
of
chimneys
and
the
poor
plants
and
the
birds
in
little
cages
belonging
to
the
neighbours
when
i
found
that
blinder
from
the
shop
below
had
come
in
perhaps
it
had
taken
her
all
this
time
to
get
upstairs
and
was
talking
to
my
guardian
it
not
much
to
forgive
the
rent
sir
she
said
who
could
take
it
from
them
well
well
said
my
guardian
to
us
two
it
is
enough
that
the
time
will
come
when
this
good
woman
will
find
that
it
was
much
and
that
forasmuch
as
she
did
it
unto
the
least
of
these
this
child
he
added
after
a
few
moments
could
she
possibly
continue
this
really
sir
i
think
she
might
said
blinder
getting
her
heavy
breath
by
painful
degrees
she
as
handy
as
it
possible
to
be
bless
you
sir
the
way
she
tended
them
two
children
after
the
mother
died
was
the
talk
of
the
yard
and
it
was
a
wonder
to
see
her
with
him
after
he
was
took
ill
it
really
was
blinder
he
said
to
me
the
very
last
he
spoke
he
was
lying
there
blinder
whatever
my
calling
may
have
been
i
see
a
angel
sitting
in
this
room
last
night
along
with
my
child
and
i
trust
her
to
our
father
he
had
no
other
calling
said
my
guardian
no
sir
returned
blinder
he
was
nothing
but
a
follerers
when
he
first
came
to
lodge
here
i
did
know
what
he
was
and
i
confess
that
when
i
found
out
i
gave
him
notice
it
was
liked
in
the
yard
it
was
approved
by
the
other
lodgers
it
is
not
a
genteel
calling
said
blinder
and
most
people
do
object
to
it
gridley
objected
to
it
very
strong
and
he
is
a
good
lodger
though
his
temper
has
been
hard
tried
so
you
gave
him
notice
said
my
guardian
so
i
gave
him
notice
said
blinder
but
really
when
the
time
came
and
i
knew
no
other
ill
of
him
i
was
in
doubts
he
was
punctual
and
diligent
he
did
what
he
had
to
do
sir
said
blinder
unconsciously
fixing
skimpole
with
her
eye
and
something
in
this
world
even
to
do
that
so
you
kept
him
after
all
why
i
said
that
if
he
could
arrange
with
gridley
i
could
arrange
it
with
the
other
lodgers
and
should
not
so
much
mind
its
being
liked
or
disliked
in
the
yard
gridley
gave
his
consent
gruff
but
gave
it
he
was
always
gruff
with
him
but
he
has
been
kind
to
the
children
since
a
person
is
never
known
till
a
person
is
proved
have
many
people
been
kind
to
the
children
asked
jarndyce
upon
the
whole
not
so
bad
sir
said
blinder
but
certainly
not
so
many
as
would
have
been
if
their
father
calling
had
been
different
coavins
gave
a
guinea
and
the
follerers
made
up
a
little
purse
some
neighbours
in
the
yard
that
had
always
joked
and
tapped
their
shoulders
when
he
went
by
came
forward
with
a
little
subscription
and
in
general
not
so
bad
similarly
with
charlotte
some
people
wo
employ
her
because
she
was
a
follerer
child
some
people
that
do
employ
her
cast
it
at
her
some
make
a
merit
of
having
her
to
work
for
them
with
that
and
all
her
upon
her
and
perhaps
pay
her
less
and
put
upon
her
more
but
she
patienter
than
others
would
be
and
is
clever
too
and
always
willing
up
to
the
full
mark
of
her
strength
and
over
so
i
should
say
in
general
not
so
bad
sir
but
might
be
better
blinder
sat
down
to
give
herself
a
more
favourable
opportunity
of
recovering
her
breath
exhausted
anew
by
so
much
talking
before
it
was
fully
restored
jarndyce
was
turning
to
speak
to
us
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
abrupt
entrance
into
the
room
of
the
gridley
who
had
been
mentioned
and
whom
we
had
seen
on
our
way
up
i
do
know
what
you
may
be
doing
here
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
as
if
he
resented
our
presence
but
you
excuse
my
coming
in
i
do
come
in
to
stare
about
me
well
charley
well
tom
well
little
one
how
is
it
with
us
all
he
bent
over
the
group
in
a
caressing
way
and
clearly
was
regarded
as
a
friend
by
the
children
though
his
face
retained
its
stern
character
and
his
manner
to
us
was
as
rude
as
it
could
be
my
guardian
noticed
it
and
respected
it
no
one
surely
would
come
here
to
stare
about
him
he
said
mildly
may
be
so
sir
may
be
so
returned
the
other
taking
tom
upon
his
knee
and
waving
him
off
impatiently
i
do
want
to
argue
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
have
had
enough
of
arguing
to
last
one
man
his
life
you
have
sufficient
reason
i
dare
say
said
jarndyce
for
being
chafed
and
irritated
there
again
exclaimed
the
man
becoming
violently
angry
i
am
of
a
quarrelsome
temper
i
am
irascible
i
am
not
polite
not
very
i
think
sir
said
gridley
putting
down
the
child
and
going
up
to
him
as
if
he
meant
to
strike
him
do
you
know
anything
of
courts
of
equity
perhaps
i
do
to
my
sorrow
to
your
sorrow
said
the
man
pausing
in
his
wrath
if
so
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
not
polite
i
know
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
with
renewed
violence
i
have
been
dragged
for
five
and
twenty
years
over
burning
iron
and
i
have
lost
the
habit
of
treading
upon
velvet
go
into
the
court
of
chancery
yonder
and
ask
what
is
one
of
the
standing
jokes
that
brighten
up
their
business
sometimes
and
they
will
tell
you
that
the
best
joke
they
have
is
the
man
from
shropshire
i
he
said
beating
one
hand
on
the
other
passionately
am
the
man
from
shropshire
i
believe
i
and
my
family
have
also
had
the
honour
of
furnishing
some
entertainment
in
the
same
grave
place
said
my
guardian
composedly
you
may
have
heard
my
name
jarndyce
jarndyce
said
gridley
with
a
rough
sort
of
salutation
you
bear
your
wrongs
more
quietly
than
i
can
bear
mine
more
than
that
i
tell
you
and
i
tell
this
gentleman
and
these
young
ladies
if
they
are
friends
of
yours
that
if
i
took
my
wrongs
in
any
other
way
i
should
be
driven
mad
it
is
only
by
resenting
them
and
by
revenging
them
in
my
mind
and
by
angrily
demanding
the
justice
i
never
get
that
i
am
able
to
keep
my
wits
together
it
is
only
that
he
said
speaking
in
a
homely
rustic
way
and
with
great
vehemence
you
may
tell
me
that
i
myself
i
answer
that
it
in
my
nature
to
do
it
under
wrong
and
i
must
do
it
there
nothing
between
doing
it
and
sinking
into
the
smiling
state
of
the
poor
little
mad
woman
that
haunts
the
court
if
i
was
once
to
sit
down
under
it
i
should
become
imbecile
the
passion
and
heat
in
which
he
was
and
the
manner
in
which
his
face
worked
and
the
violent
gestures
with
which
he
accompanied
what
he
said
were
most
painful
to
see
jarndyce
he
said
consider
my
case
as
true
as
there
is
a
heaven
above
us
this
is
my
case
i
am
one
of
two
brothers
my
father
a
farmer
made
a
will
and
left
his
farm
and
stock
and
so
forth
to
my
mother
for
her
life
after
my
mother
death
all
was
to
come
to
me
except
a
legacy
of
three
hundred
pounds
that
i
was
then
to
pay
my
brother
my
mother
died
my
brother
some
time
afterwards
claimed
his
legacy
i
and
some
of
my
relations
said
that
he
had
had
a
part
of
it
already
in
board
and
lodging
and
some
other
things
now
mind
that
was
the
question
and
nothing
else
no
one
disputed
the
will
no
one
disputed
anything
but
whether
part
of
that
three
hundred
pounds
had
been
already
paid
or
not
to
settle
that
question
my
brother
filing
a
bill
i
was
obliged
to
go
into
this
accursed
chancery
i
was
forced
there
because
the
law
forced
me
and
would
let
me
go
nowhere
else
seventeen
people
were
made
defendants
to
that
simple
suit
it
first
came
on
after
two
years
it
was
then
stopped
for
another
two
years
while
the
master
may
his
head
rot
off
inquired
whether
i
was
my
father
son
about
which
there
was
no
dispute
at
all
with
any
mortal
creature
he
then
found
out
that
there
were
not
defendants
enough
remember
there
were
only
seventeen
as
yet
but
that
we
must
have
another
who
had
been
left
out
and
must
begin
all
over
again
the
costs
at
that
time
before
the
thing
was
begun
were
three
times
the
legacy
my
brother
would
have
given
up
the
legacy
and
joyful
to
escape
more
costs
my
whole
estate
left
to
me
in
that
will
of
my
father
has
gone
in
costs
the
suit
still
undecided
has
fallen
into
rack
and
ruin
and
despair
with
everything
else
and
here
i
stand
this
day
now
jarndyce
in
your
suit
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
involved
where
in
mine
there
are
hundreds
is
mine
less
hard
to
bear
or
is
it
harder
to
bear
when
my
whole
living
was
in
it
and
has
been
thus
shamefully
sucked
away
jarndyce
said
that
he
condoled
with
him
with
all
his
heart
and
that
he
set
up
no
monopoly
himself
in
being
unjustly
treated
by
this
monstrous
system
there
again
said
gridley
with
no
diminution
of
his
rage
the
system
i
am
told
on
all
hands
it
the
system
i
must
look
to
individuals
it
the
system
i
must
go
into
court
and
say
lord
i
beg
to
know
this
from
you
is
this
right
or
wrong
have
you
the
face
to
tell
me
i
have
received
justice
and
therefore
am
dismissed
my
lord
knows
nothing
of
it
he
sits
there
to
administer
the
system
i
must
go
to
tulkinghorn
the
solicitor
in
lincoln
inn
fields
and
say
to
him
when
he
makes
me
furious
by
being
so
cool
and
satisfied
as
they
all
do
for
i
know
they
gain
by
it
while
i
lose
do
i
i
must
say
to
him
will
have
something
out
of
some
one
for
my
ruin
by
fair
means
or
foul
he
is
not
responsible
it
the
system
but
if
i
do
no
violence
to
any
of
them
here
i
may
i
do
know
what
may
happen
if
i
am
carried
beyond
myself
at
last
i
will
accuse
the
individual
workers
of
that
system
against
me
face
to
face
before
the
great
eternal
bar
his
passion
was
fearful
i
could
not
have
believed
in
such
rage
without
seeing
it
i
have
done
he
said
sitting
down
and
wiping
his
face
jarndyce
i
have
done
i
am
violent
i
know
i
ought
to
know
it
i
have
been
in
prison
for
contempt
of
court
i
have
been
in
prison
for
threatening
the
solicitor
i
have
been
in
this
trouble
and
that
trouble
and
shall
be
again
i
am
the
man
from
shropshire
and
i
sometimes
go
beyond
amusing
them
though
they
have
found
it
amusing
too
to
see
me
committed
into
custody
and
brought
up
in
custody
and
all
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
they
tell
me
if
i
restrained
myself
i
tell
them
that
if
i
did
restrain
myself
i
should
become
imbecile
i
was
a
man
once
i
believe
people
in
my
part
of
the
country
say
they
remember
me
so
but
now
i
must
have
this
vent
under
my
sense
of
injury
or
nothing
could
hold
my
wits
together
it
would
be
far
better
for
you
gridley
the
lord
chancellor
told
me
last
week
to
waste
your
time
here
and
to
stay
usefully
employed
down
in
shropshire
lord
my
lord
i
know
it
would
said
i
to
him
it
would
have
been
far
better
for
me
never
to
have
heard
the
name
of
your
high
office
but
unhappily
for
me
i
ca
undo
the
past
and
the
past
drives
me
here
besides
he
added
breaking
fiercely
out
i
shame
them
to
the
last
i
show
myself
in
that
court
to
its
shame
if
i
knew
when
i
was
going
to
die
and
could
be
carried
there
and
had
a
voice
to
speak
with
i
would
die
there
saying
have
brought
me
here
and
sent
me
from
here
many
and
many
a
time
now
send
me
out
feet
foremost
his
countenance
had
perhaps
for
years
become
so
set
in
its
contentious
expression
that
it
did
not
soften
even
now
when
he
was
quiet
i
came
to
take
these
babies
down
to
my
room
for
an
hour
he
said
going
to
them
again
and
let
them
play
about
i
did
mean
to
say
all
this
but
it
do
much
signify
you
not
afraid
of
me
tom
are
you
no
said
tom
you
ai
angry
with
me
you
are
right
my
child
you
going
back
charley
aye
come
then
little
one
he
took
the
youngest
child
on
his
arm
where
she
was
willing
enough
to
be
carried
i
should
wonder
if
we
found
a
soldier
downstairs
let
go
and
look
for
him
he
made
his
former
rough
salutation
which
was
not
deficient
in
a
certain
respect
to
jarndyce
and
bowing
slightly
to
us
went
downstairs
to
his
room
upon
that
skimpole
began
to
talk
for
the
first
time
since
our
arrival
in
his
usual
gay
strain
he
said
well
it
was
really
very
pleasant
to
see
how
things
lazily
adapted
themselves
to
purposes
here
was
this
gridley
a
man
of
a
robust
will
and
surprising
energy
intellectually
speaking
a
sort
of
inharmonious
blacksmith
and
he
could
easily
imagine
that
there
gridley
was
years
ago
wandering
about
in
life
for
something
to
expend
his
superfluous
combativeness
upon
a
sort
of
young
love
among
the
thorns
when
the
court
of
chancery
came
in
his
way
and
accommodated
him
with
the
exact
thing
he
wanted
there
they
were
matched
ever
afterwards
otherwise
he
might
have
been
a
great
general
blowing
up
all
sorts
of
towns
or
he
might
have
been
a
great
politician
dealing
in
all
sorts
of
parliamentary
rhetoric
but
as
it
was
he
and
the
court
of
chancery
had
fallen
upon
each
other
in
the
pleasantest
way
and
nobody
was
much
the
worse
and
gridley
was
so
to
speak
from
that
hour
provided
for
then
look
at
coavinses
how
delightfully
poor
coavinses
father
of
these
charming
children
illustrated
the
same
principle
he
skimpole
himself
had
sometimes
repined
at
the
existence
of
coavinses
he
had
found
coavinses
in
his
way
he
could
had
dispensed
with
coavinses
there
had
been
times
when
if
he
had
been
a
sultan
and
his
grand
vizier
had
said
one
morning
what
does
the
commander
of
the
faithful
require
at
the
hands
of
his
slave
he
might
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
reply
the
head
of
coavinses
but
what
turned
out
to
be
the
case
that
all
that
time
he
had
been
giving
employment
to
a
most
deserving
man
that
he
had
been
a
benefactor
to
coavinses
that
he
had
actually
been
enabling
coavinses
to
bring
up
these
charming
children
in
this
agreeable
way
developing
these
social
virtues
insomuch
that
his
heart
had
just
now
swelled
and
the
tears
had
come
into
his
eyes
when
he
had
looked
round
the
room
and
thought
i
was
the
great
patron
of
coavinses
and
his
little
comforts
were
my
work
there
was
something
so
captivating
in
his
light
way
of
touching
these
fantastic
strings
and
he
was
such
a
mirthful
child
by
the
side
of
the
graver
childhood
we
had
seen
that
he
made
my
guardian
smile
even
as
he
turned
towards
us
from
a
little
private
talk
with
blinder
we
kissed
charley
and
took
her
downstairs
with
us
and
stopped
outside
the
house
to
see
her
run
away
to
her
work
i
do
know
where
she
was
going
but
we
saw
her
run
such
a
little
little
creature
in
her
womanly
bonnet
and
apron
through
a
covered
way
at
the
bottom
of
the
court
and
melt
into
the
city
strife
and
sound
like
a
dewdrop
in
an
ocean
chapter
xvi
my
lady
dedlock
is
restless
very
restless
the
astonished
fashionable
intelligence
hardly
knows
where
to
have
her
she
is
at
chesney
wold
yesterday
she
was
at
her
house
in
town
she
may
be
abroad
for
anything
the
fashionable
intelligence
can
with
confidence
predict
even
sir
leicester
gallantry
has
some
trouble
to
keep
pace
with
her
it
would
have
more
but
that
his
other
faithful
ally
for
better
and
for
worse
the
gout
darts
into
the
old
oak
at
chesney
wold
and
grips
him
by
both
legs
sir
leicester
receives
the
gout
as
a
troublesome
demon
but
still
a
demon
of
the
patrician
order
all
the
dedlocks
in
the
direct
male
line
through
a
course
of
time
during
and
beyond
which
the
memory
of
man
goeth
not
to
the
contrary
have
had
the
gout
it
can
be
proved
sir
other
men
fathers
may
have
died
of
the
rheumatism
or
may
have
taken
base
contagion
from
the
tainted
blood
of
the
sick
vulgar
but
the
dedlock
family
have
communicated
something
exclusive
even
to
the
levelling
process
of
dying
by
dying
of
their
own
family
gout
it
has
come
down
through
the
illustrious
line
like
the
plate
or
the
pictures
or
the
place
in
lincolnshire
it
is
among
their
dignities
sir
leicester
is
perhaps
not
wholly
without
an
impression
though
he
has
never
resolved
it
into
words
that
the
angel
of
death
in
the
discharge
of
his
necessary
duties
may
observe
to
the
shades
of
the
aristocracy
my
lords
and
gentlemen
i
have
the
honour
to
present
to
you
another
dedlock
certified
to
have
arrived
per
the
family
gout
hence
sir
leicester
yields
up
his
family
legs
to
the
family
disorder
as
if
he
held
his
name
and
fortune
on
that
feudal
tenure
he
feels
that
for
a
dedlock
to
be
laid
upon
his
back
and
spasmodically
twitched
and
stabbed
in
his
extremities
is
a
liberty
taken
somewhere
but
he
thinks
we
have
all
yielded
to
this
it
belongs
to
us
it
has
for
some
hundreds
of
years
been
understood
that
we
are
not
to
make
the
vaults
in
the
park
interesting
on
more
ignoble
terms
and
i
submit
myself
to
the
compromise
and
a
goodly
show
he
makes
lying
in
a
flush
of
crimson
and
gold
in
the
midst
of
the
great
before
his
favourite
picture
of
my
lady
with
broad
strips
of
sunlight
shining
in
down
the
long
perspective
through
the
long
line
of
windows
and
alternating
with
soft
reliefs
of
shadow
outside
the
stately
oaks
rooted
for
ages
in
the
green
ground
which
has
never
known
ploughshare
but
was
still
a
chase
when
kings
rode
to
battle
with
sword
and
shield
and
rode
with
bow
and
arrow
bear
witness
to
his
greatness
inside
his
forefathers
looking
on
him
from
the
walls
say
each
of
us
was
a
passing
reality
here
and
left
this
coloured
shadow
of
himself
and
melted
into
remembrance
as
dreamy
as
the
distant
voices
of
the
rooks
now
lulling
you
to
rest
and
hear
their
testimony
to
his
greatness
too
and
he
is
very
great
this
day
and
woe
to
boythorn
or
other
daring
wight
who
shall
presumptuously
contest
an
inch
with
him
my
lady
is
at
present
represented
near
sir
leicester
by
her
portrait
she
has
flitted
away
to
town
with
no
intention
of
remaining
there
and
will
soon
flit
hither
again
to
the
confusion
of
the
fashionable
intelligence
the
house
in
town
is
not
prepared
for
her
reception
it
is
muffled
and
dreary
only
one
mercury
in
powder
gapes
disconsolate
at
the
and
he
mentioned
last
night
to
another
mercury
of
his
acquaintance
also
accustomed
to
good
society
that
if
that
sort
of
thing
was
to
last
which
it
could
for
a
man
of
his
spirits
could
bear
it
and
a
man
of
his
figure
could
be
expected
to
bear
it
there
would
be
no
resource
for
him
upon
his
honour
but
to
cut
his
throat
what
connexion
can
there
be
between
the
place
in
lincolnshire
the
house
in
town
the
mercury
in
powder
and
the
whereabout
of
jo
the
outlaw
with
the
broom
who
had
that
distant
ray
of
light
upon
him
when
he
swept
the
what
connexion
can
there
have
been
between
many
people
in
the
innumerable
histories
of
this
world
who
from
opposite
sides
of
great
gulfs
have
nevertheless
been
very
curiously
brought
together
jo
sweeps
his
crossing
all
day
long
unconscious
of
the
link
if
any
link
there
be
he
sums
up
his
mental
condition
when
asked
a
question
by
replying
that
he
do
know
nothink
he
knows
that
it
hard
to
keep
the
mud
off
the
crossing
in
dirty
weather
and
harder
still
to
live
by
doing
it
nobody
taught
him
even
that
much
he
found
it
out
jo
lives
that
is
to
say
jo
has
not
yet
died
in
a
ruinous
place
known
to
the
like
of
him
by
the
name
of
it
is
a
black
dilapidated
street
avoided
by
all
decent
people
where
the
crazy
houses
were
seized
upon
when
their
decay
was
far
advanced
by
some
bold
vagrants
who
after
establishing
their
own
possession
took
to
letting
them
out
in
lodgings
now
these
tumbling
tenements
contain
by
night
a
swarm
of
misery
as
on
the
ruined
human
wretch
vermin
parasites
appear
so
these
ruined
shelters
have
bred
a
crowd
of
foul
existence
that
crawls
in
and
out
of
gaps
in
walls
and
boards
and
coils
itself
to
sleep
in
maggot
numbers
where
the
rain
drips
in
and
comes
and
goes
fetching
and
carrying
fever
and
sowing
more
evil
in
its
every
footprint
than
lord
coodle
and
sir
thomas
doodle
and
the
duke
of
foodle
and
all
the
fine
gentlemen
in
office
down
to
zoodle
shall
set
right
in
five
hundred
years
though
born
expressly
to
do
it
twice
lately
there
has
been
a
crash
and
a
cloud
of
dust
like
the
springing
of
a
mine
in
and
each
time
a
house
has
fallen
these
accidents
have
made
a
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
and
have
filled
a
bed
or
two
in
the
nearest
hospital
the
gaps
remain
and
there
are
not
unpopular
lodgings
among
the
rubbish
as
several
more
houses
are
nearly
ready
to
go
the
next
crash
in
may
be
expected
to
be
a
good
one
this
desirable
property
is
in
chancery
of
course
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
discernment
of
any
man
with
half
an
eye
to
tell
him
so
whether
tom
is
the
popular
representative
of
the
original
plaintiff
or
defendant
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
or
whether
tom
lived
here
when
the
suit
had
laid
the
street
waste
all
alone
until
other
settlers
came
to
join
him
or
whether
the
traditional
title
is
a
comprehensive
name
for
a
retreat
cut
off
from
honest
company
and
put
out
of
the
pale
of
hope
perhaps
nobody
knows
certainly
jo
do
know
for
i
do
says
jo
i
do
know
nothink
it
must
be
a
strange
state
to
be
like
jo
to
shuffle
through
the
streets
unfamiliar
with
the
shapes
and
in
utter
darkness
as
to
the
meaning
of
those
mysterious
symbols
so
abundant
over
the
shops
and
at
the
corners
of
streets
and
on
the
doors
and
in
the
windows
to
see
people
read
and
to
see
people
write
and
to
see
the
postmen
deliver
letters
and
not
to
have
the
least
idea
of
all
that
language
to
be
to
every
scrap
of
it
stone
blind
and
dumb
it
must
be
very
puzzling
to
see
the
good
company
going
to
the
churches
on
sundays
with
their
books
in
their
hands
and
to
think
for
perhaps
jo
does
think
at
odd
times
what
does
it
all
mean
and
if
it
means
anything
to
anybody
how
comes
it
that
it
means
nothing
to
me
to
be
hustled
and
jostled
and
moved
on
and
really
to
feel
that
it
would
appear
to
be
perfectly
true
that
i
have
no
business
here
or
there
or
anywhere
and
yet
to
be
perplexed
by
the
consideration
that
i
am
here
somehow
too
and
everybody
overlooked
me
until
i
became
the
creature
that
i
am
it
must
be
a
strange
state
not
merely
to
be
told
that
i
am
scarcely
human
as
in
the
case
of
my
offering
myself
for
a
witness
but
to
feel
it
of
my
own
knowledge
all
my
life
to
see
the
horses
dogs
and
cattle
go
by
me
and
to
know
that
in
ignorance
i
belong
to
them
and
not
to
the
superior
beings
in
my
shape
whose
delicacy
i
offend
jo
ideas
of
a
criminal
trial
or
a
judge
or
a
bishop
or
a
government
or
that
inestimable
jewel
to
him
if
he
only
knew
it
the
constitution
should
be
strange
his
whole
material
and
immaterial
life
is
wonderfully
strange
his
death
the
strangest
thing
of
all
jo
comes
out
of
meeting
the
tardy
morning
which
is
always
late
in
getting
down
there
and
munches
his
dirty
bit
of
bread
as
he
comes
along
his
way
lying
through
many
streets
and
the
houses
not
yet
being
open
he
sits
down
to
breakfast
on
the
of
the
society
for
the
propagation
of
the
gospel
in
foreign
parts
and
gives
it
a
brush
when
he
has
finished
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
accommodation
he
admires
the
size
of
the
edifice
and
wonders
what
it
all
about
he
has
no
idea
poor
wretch
of
the
spiritual
destitution
of
a
coral
reef
in
the
pacific
or
what
it
costs
to
look
up
the
precious
souls
among
the
and
he
goes
to
his
crossing
and
begins
to
lay
it
out
for
the
day
the
town
awakes
the
great
is
set
up
for
its
daily
spin
and
whirl
all
that
unaccountable
reading
and
writing
which
has
been
suspended
for
a
few
hours
recommences
jo
and
the
other
lower
animals
get
on
in
the
unintelligible
mess
as
they
can
it
is
the
blinded
oxen
never
guided
run
into
wrong
places
and
are
beaten
out
and
plunge
and
foaming
at
stone
walls
and
often
sorely
hurt
the
innocent
and
often
sorely
hurt
themselves
very
like
jo
and
his
order
very
very
like
a
band
of
music
comes
and
plays
jo
listens
to
it
so
does
a
dog
a
drover
dog
waiting
for
his
master
outside
a
butcher
shop
and
evidently
thinking
about
those
sheep
he
has
had
upon
his
mind
for
some
hours
and
is
happily
rid
of
he
seems
perplexed
respecting
three
or
four
ca
remember
where
he
left
them
looks
up
and
down
the
street
as
half
expecting
to
see
them
astray
suddenly
pricks
up
his
ears
and
remembers
all
about
it
a
thoroughly
vagabond
dog
accustomed
to
low
company
and
a
terrific
dog
to
sheep
ready
at
a
whistle
to
scamper
over
their
backs
and
tear
out
mouthfuls
of
their
wool
but
an
educated
improved
developed
dog
who
has
been
taught
his
duties
and
knows
how
to
discharge
them
he
and
jo
listen
to
the
music
probably
with
much
the
same
amount
of
animal
satisfaction
likewise
as
to
awakened
association
aspiration
or
regret
melancholy
or
joyful
reference
to
things
beyond
the
senses
they
are
probably
upon
a
par
but
otherwise
how
far
above
the
human
listener
is
the
brute
turn
that
dog
descendants
wild
like
jo
and
in
a
very
few
years
they
will
so
degenerate
that
they
will
lose
even
their
bark
but
not
their
bite
the
day
changes
as
it
wears
itself
away
and
becomes
dark
and
drizzly
jo
fights
it
out
at
his
crossing
among
the
mud
and
wheels
the
horses
whips
and
umbrellas
and
gets
but
a
scanty
sum
to
pay
for
the
unsavoury
shelter

up

the

gridley
a

for

no

look

is
the
hand
not

pointing
there
so
he
does
not
look
out

and
if
he
did
what
would
it
be
to
see
a
woman
going
by
there
are
women
enough
in
the
world
tulkinghorn
thinks
too
many
they
are
at
the
bottom
of
all
that
goes
wrong
in
it
though
for
the
matter
of
that
they
create

what

it
be

a

even
though

they

secret
tulkinghorn
knows
that
very
well
but
they
are

the

who
now
leaves
him
and
his
house
behind
between
whose
plain
dress
and
her
refined
manner
there
is
something
exceedingly
inconsistent
she
should
be
an
upper
servant
by
her
attire
yet
in
her
air
and
step
though
both
are
hurried
and
assumed
as
far
as
she
can
assume
in
the
muddy
streets
which
she
treads
with
an
unaccustomed
foot
she
is
a
lady
her
face
is
veiled
and
still
she
sufficiently
betrays
herself
to
make
more
than
one
of
those
who
pass
her
look
round
sharply
she
never
turns
her
head
lady
or

she
has
a
purpose
in
her
and
can
follow
it
she
never
turns
her
head
until
she
comes
to
the
crossing
where
jo
plies
with
his
broom
he
crosses
with
her
and
begs
still
she
does
not
turn
her
head
until
she
has
landed
on
the
other
side
then
she
slightly
beckons
to
him
and
says
come
here
jo
follows
her
a
pace
or
two
into
a
quiet
court
are
you
the
boy
i
read
of
in

asked

at

nothink
about

he
look
when
he
was
living
so
very
ill
and

jo
did
he
look

the

with
abhorrence
oh
not
so
bad
as
me
says
jo

a
one

him
did
you
how
dare
you
ask
me
if
i
knew
him
no
offence
my
lady
says
jo
with
much
humility
for
even
he
has
got
at
the
suspicion
of
her
being
a
lady
i
am
not
a
lady
i
am
a
servant
you
are
a
jolly
servant
says
jo
without
the
least
idea
of
saying
anything
offensive
merely
as
a
tribute
of
admiration
listen
and
be
silent
do
talk
to
me
and
stand
farther
from
me
can
you
show
me
all
those
places
that
were
spoken
of
in
the
account
i
read
the
place
he
wrote
for
the
place
he
died
at
the
place
where
you
were
taken
to
and
the
place
where
he
was
buried
do
you
know
the
place
where
he
was
buried
jo
answers
with
a
nod
having
also
nodded
as
each
other
place
was
mentioned
go
before
me
and
show
me
all
those
dreadful
places
stop
opposite
to
each
and
do
speak
to
me
unless
i
speak
to
you
do
look
back
do
what
i
want
and
i
will
pay
you
well
jo
attends
closely
while
the
words
are
being
spoken
tells
them
off
on
his
finding
them
rather
hard
pauses
to
consider
their
meaning
considers
it
satisfactory
and
nods
his
ragged
head
i
fly
says
jo
but
fen
larks
you
know
stow
hooking
it
what
does
the
horrible
creature
mean
exclaims
the
servant
recoiling
from
him
stow
cutting
away
you
know
says
jo
i
do
understand
you
go
on
before
i
will
give
you
more
money
than
you
ever
had
in
your
life
jo
screws
up
his
mouth
into
a
whistle
gives
his
ragged
head
a
rub
takes
his
broom
under
his
arm
and
leads
the
way
passing
deftly
with
his
bare
feet
over
the
hard
stones
and
through
the
mud
and
mire
cook
court
jo
stops
a
pause
who
lives
here
him
wot
give
him
his
writing
and
give
me
half
a
bull
says
jo
in
a
whisper
without
looking
over
his
shoulder
go
on
to
the
next
krook
house
jo
stops
again
a
longer
pause
who
lives
here
he
lived
here
jo
answers
as
before
after
a
silence
he
is
asked
in
which
room
in
the
back
room
up
there
you
can
see
the
winder
from
this
corner
up
there
that
where
i
see
him
stritched
out
this
is
the
where
i
was
took
to
go
on
to
the
next
it
is
a
longer
walk
to
the
next
but
jo
relieved
of
his
first
suspicions
sticks
to
the
forms
imposed
upon
him
and
does
not
look
round
by
many
devious
ways
reeking
with
offence
of
many
kinds
they
come
to
the
little
tunnel
of
a
court
and
to
the
lighted
now
and
to
the
iron
gate
he
was
put
there
says
jo
holding
to
the
bars
and
looking
in
where
oh
what
a
scene
of
horror
there
says
jo
pointing
over
yinder
among
them
piles
of
bones
and
close
to
that
there
kitchin
winder
they
put
him
wery
nigh
the
top
they
was
obliged
to
stamp
upon
it
to
git
it
in
i
could
unkiver
it
for
you
with
my
broom
if
the
gate
was
open
that
why
they
locks
it
i
giving
it
a
shake
it
always
locked
look
at
the
rat
cries
jo
excited
hi
look
there
he
goes
ho
into
the
ground
the
servant
shrinks
into
a
corner
into
a
corner
of
that
hideous
archway
with
its
deadly
stains
contaminating
her
dress
and
putting
out
her
two
hands
and
passionately
telling
him
to
keep
away
from
her
for
he
is
loathsome
to
her
so
remains
for
some
moments
jo
stands
staring
and
is
still
staring
when
she
recovers
herself
is
this
place
of
abomination
consecrated
ground
i
do
know
nothink
of
consequential
ground
says
jo
still
staring
is
it
blessed
which
says
jo
in
the
last
degree
amazed
is
it
blessed
i
blest
if
i
know
says
jo
staring
more
than
ever
but
i
should
think
it
war
blest
repeats
jo
something
troubled
in
his
mind
it
a
done
it
much
good
if
it
is
blest
i
should
think
it
was
myself
but
i
do
know
nothink
the
servant
takes
as
little
heed
of
what
he
says
as
she
seems
to
take
of
what
she
has
said
herself
she
draws
off
her
glove
to
get
some
money
from
her
purse
jo
silently
notices
how
white
and
small
her
hand
is
and
what
a
jolly
servant
she
must
be
to
wear
such
sparkling
rings
she
drops
a
piece
of
money
in
his
hand
without
touching
it
and
shuddering
as
their
hands
approach
now
she
adds
show
me
the
spot
again
jo
thrusts
the
handle
of
his
broom
between
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
with
his
utmost
power
of
elaboration
points
it
out
at
length
looking
aside
to
see
if
he
has
made
himself
intelligible
he
finds
that
he
is
alone
his
first
proceeding
is
to
hold
the
piece
of
money
to
the
and
to
be
overpowered
at
finding
that
it
is
yellow
gold
his
next
is
to
give
it
a
bite
at
the
edge
as
a
test
of
its
quality
his
next
to
put
it
in
his
mouth
for
safety
and
to
sweep
the
step
and
passage
with
great
care
his
job
done
he
sets
off
for
stopping
in
the
light
of
innumerable
to
produce
the
piece
of
gold
and
give
it
another
bite
as
a
reassurance
of
its
being
genuine
the
mercury
in
powder

in

goes
to

dinner
and
three
or
four
balls
sir

fidgety
down
at

wold
with
no
better
company
than
the
gout
he
complains
to
rouncewell
that

that
he

read

is
chapter
xvii
esther
narrative
richard
very
often
came
to
see
us
while
we
remained
in
london
though
he
soon
failed
in
his
and
with
his
quick
abilities
his
good
spirits
his
good
temper
his
gaiety
and
freshness
was
always
delightful
but
though
i
liked
him
more
and
more
the
better
i
knew
him
i
still
felt
more
and
more
how
much
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
he
had
been
educated
in
no
habits
of
application
and
concentration
the
system
which
had
addressed
him
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
it
had
addressed
hundreds
of
other
boys
all
varying
in
character
and
capacity
had
enabled
him
to
dash
through
his
tasks
always
with
fair
credit
and
often
with
distinction
but
in
a
fitful
dazzling
way
that
had
confirmed
his
reliance
on
those
very
qualities
in
himself
which
it
had
been
most
desirable
to
direct
and
train
they
were
good
qualities
without
which
no
high
place
can
be
meritoriously
won
but
like
fire
and
water
though
excellent
servants
they
were
very
bad
masters
if
they
had
been
under
richard
direction
they
would
have
been
his
friends
but
richard
being
under
their
direction
they
became
his
enemies
i
write
down
these
opinions
not
because
i
believe
that
this
or
any
other
thing
was
so
because
i
thought
so
but
only
because
i
did
think
so
and
i
want
to
be
quite
candid
about
all
i
thought
and
did
these
were
my
thoughts
about
richard
i
thought
i
often
observed
besides
how
right
my
guardian
was
in
what
he
had
said
and
that
the
uncertainties
and
delays
of
the
chancery
suit
had
imparted
to
his
nature
something
of
the
careless
spirit
of
a
gamester
who
felt
that
he
was
part
of
a
great
gaming
system
and
bayham
badger
coming
one
afternoon
when
my
guardian
was
not
at
home
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
naturally
inquired
after
richard
why
carstone
said
badger
is
very
well
and
is
i
assure
you
a
great
acquisition
to
our
society
captain
swosser
used
to
say
of
me
that
i
was
always
better
than
land
and
a
breeze
to
the
midshipmen
mess
when
the
purser
junk
had
become
as
tough
as
the
weather
earings
it
was
his
naval
way
of
mentioning
generally
that
i
was
an
acquisition
to
any
society
i
may
render
the
same
tribute
i
am
sure
to
carstone
but
i
you
think
me
premature
if
i
mention
it
i
said
no
as
badger
insinuating
tone
seemed
to
require
such
an
answer
nor
miss
clare
said
bayham
badger
sweetly
ada
said
no
too
and
looked
uneasy
why
you
see
my
dears
said
badger
you
excuse
me
calling
you
my
dears
we
entreated
badger
not
to
mention
it
because
you
really
are
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
of
saying
so
pursued
badger
so
perfectly
charming
you
see
my
dears
that
although
i
am
still
young
or
bayham
badger
pays
me
the
compliment
of
saying
so
no
badger
called
out
like
some
one
contradicting
at
a
public
meeting
not
at
all
very
well
smiled
badger
we
will
say
still
young
undoubtedly
said
badger
my
dears
though
still
young
i
have
had
many
opportunities
of
observing
young
men
there
were
many
such
on
board
the
dear
old
crippler
i
assure
you
after
that
when
i
was
with
captain
swosser
in
the
mediterranean
i
embraced
every
opportunity
of
knowing
and
befriending
the
midshipmen
under
captain
swosser
command
you
never
heard
them
called
the
young
gentlemen
my
dears
and
probably
would
not
understand
allusions
to
their
their
weekly
accounts
but
it
is
otherwise
with
me
for
blue
water
has
been
a
second
home
to
me
and
i
have
been
quite
a
sailor
again
with
professor
dingo
a
man
of
european
reputation
murmured
badger
when
i
lost
my
dear
first
and
became
the
wife
of
my
dear
second
said
badger
speaking
of
her
former
husbands
as
if
they
were
parts
of
a
charade
i
still
enjoyed
opportunities
of
observing
youth
the
class
attendant
on
professor
dingo
lectures
was
a
large
one
and
it
became
my
pride
as
the
wife
of
an
eminent
scientific
man
seeking
herself
in
science
the
utmost
consolation
it
could
impart
to
throw
our
house
open
to
the
students
as
a
kind
of
scientific
exchange
every
tuesday
evening
there
was
lemonade
and
a
mixed
biscuit
for
all
who
chose
to
partake
of
those
refreshments
and
there
was
science
to
an
unlimited
extent
remarkable
assemblies
those
miss
summerson
said
badger
reverentially
there
must
have
been
great
intellectual
friction
going
on
there
under
the
auspices
of
such
a
man
and
now
pursued
badger
now
that
i
am
the
wife
of
my
dear
third
badger
i
still
pursue
those
habits
of
observation
which
were
formed
during
the
lifetime
of
captain
swosser
and
adapted
to
new
and
unexpected
purposes
during
the
lifetime
of
professor
dingo
i
therefore
have
not
come
to
the
consideration
of
carstone
as
a
neophyte
and
yet
i
am
very
much
of
the
opinion
my
dears
that
he
has
not
chosen
his
profession
advisedly
ada
looked
so
very
anxious
now
that
i
asked
badger
on
what
she
founded
her
supposition
my
dear
miss
summerson
she
replied
on
carstone
character
and
conduct
he
is
of
such
a
very
easy
disposition
that
probably
he
would
never
think
it
to
mention
how
he
really
feels
but
he
feels
languid
about
the
profession
he
has
not
that
positive
interest
in
it
which
makes
it
his
vocation
if
he
has
any
decided
impression
in
reference
to
it
i
should
say
it
was
that
it
is
a
tiresome
pursuit
now
this
is
not
promising
young
men
like
allan
woodcourt
who
take
it
from
a
strong
interest
in
all
that
it
can
do
will
find
some
reward
in
it
through
a
great
deal
of
work
for
a
very
little
money
and
through
years
of
considerable
endurance
and
disappointment
but
i
am
quite
convinced
that
this
would
never
be
the
case
with
mr
carstone
does
badger
think
so
too
asked
ada
timidly
why
said
badger
to
tell
the
truth
miss
clare
this
view
of
the
matter
had
not
occurred
to
me
until
badger
mentioned
it
but
when
badger
put
it
in
that
light
i
naturally
gave
great
consideration
to
it
knowing
that
badger
mind
in
addition
to
its
natural
advantages
has
had
the
rare
advantage
of
being
formed
by
two
such
very
distinguished
i
will
even
say
illustrious
public
men
as
captain
swosser
of
the
royal
navy
and
professor
dingo
the
conclusion
at
which
i
have
arrived
is
in
short
is
conclusion
it
was
a
maxim
of
captain
swosser
said
badger
speaking
in
his
figurative
naval
manner
that
when
you
make
pitch
hot
you
can
not
make
it
too
hot
and
that
if
you
only
have
to
swab
a
plank
you
should
swab
it
as
if
davy
jones
were
after
you
it
appears
to
me
that
this
maxim
is
applicable
to
the
medical
as
well
as
to
the
nautical
profession
to
all
professions
observed
badger
it
was
admirably
said
by
captain
swosser
beautifully
said
people
objected
to
professor
dingo
when
we
were
staying
in
the
north
of
devon
after
our
marriage
said
badger
that
he
disfigured
some
of
the
houses
and
other
buildings
by
chipping
off
fragments
of
those
edifices
with
his
little
geological
hammer
but
the
professor
replied
that
he
knew
of
no
building
save
the
temple
of
science
the
principle
is
the
same
i
think
precisely
the
same
said
badger
finely
expressed
the
professor
made
the
same
remark
miss
summerson
in
his
last
illness
when
his
mind
wandering
he
insisted
on
keeping
his
little
hammer
under
the
pillow
and
chipping
at
the
countenances
of
the
attendants
the
ruling
passion
although
we
could
have
dispensed
with
the
length
at
which
and
badger
pursued
the
conversation
we
both
felt
that
it
was
disinterested
in
them
to
express
the
opinion
they
had
communicated
to
us
and
that
there
was
a
great
probability
of
its
being
sound
we
agreed
to
say
nothing
to
jarndyce
until
we
had
spoken
to
richard
and
as
he
was
coming
next
evening
we
resolved
to
have
a
very
serious
talk
with
him
so
after
he
had
been
a
little
while
with
ada
i
went
in
and
found
my
darling
as
i
knew
she
would
be
prepared
to
consider
him
thoroughly
right
in
whatever
he
said
and
how
do
you
get
on
richard
said
i
always
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
him
he
made
quite
a
sister
of
me
oh
well
enough
said
richard
he
ca
say
better
than
that
esther
can
he
cried
my
pet
triumphantly
i
tried
to
look
at
my
pet
in
the
wisest
manner
but
of
course
i
could
well
enough
i
repeated
yes
said
richard
well
enough
it
rather
and
humdrum
but
it
do
as
well
as
anything
else
oh
my
dear
richard
i
remonstrated
what
the
matter
said
richard
do
as
well
as
anything
else
i
do
think
there
any
harm
in
that
dame
durden
said
ada
looking
so
confidingly
at
me
across
him
because
if
it
will
do
as
well
as
anything
else
it
will
do
very
well
i
hope
oh
yes
i
hope
so
returned
richard
carelessly
tossing
his
hair
from
his
forehead
after
all
it
may
be
only
a
kind
of
probation
till
our
suit
is
i
forgot
though
i
am
not
to
mention
the
suit
forbidden
ground
oh
yes
it
all
right
enough
let
us
talk
about
something
else
ada
would
have
done
so
willingly
and
with
a
full
persuasion
that
we
had
brought
the
question
to
a
most
satisfactory
state
but
i
thought
it
would
be
useless
to
stop
there
so
i
began
again
no
but
richard
said
i
and
my
dear
ada
consider
how
important
it
is
to
you
both
and
what
a
point
of
honour
it
is
towards
your
cousin
that
you
richard
should
be
quite
in
earnest
without
any
reservation
i
think
we
had
better
talk
about
this
really
ada
it
will
be
too
late
very
soon
oh
yes
we
must
talk
about
it
said
ada
but
i
think
richard
is
right
what
was
the
use
of
my
trying
to
look
wise
when
she
was
so
pretty
and
so
engaging
and
so
fond
of
him
and
badger
were
here
yesterday
richard
said
i
and
they
seemed
disposed
to
think
that
you
had
no
great
liking
for
the
profession
did
they
though
said
richard
oh
well
that
rather
alters
the
case
because
i
had
no
idea
that
they
thought
so
and
i
should
not
have
liked
to
disappoint
or
inconvenience
them
the
fact
is
i
care
much
about
it
but
oh
it
do
matter
it
do
as
well
as
anything
else
you
hear
him
ada
said
i
the
fact
is
richard
proceeded
half
thoughtfully
and
half
jocosely
it
is
not
quite
in
my
way
i
do
take
to
it
and
i
get
too
much
of
bayham
badger
first
and
second
i
am
sure
that
very
natural
cried
ada
quite
delighted
the
very
thing
we
both
said
yesterday
esther
then
pursued
richard
it
monotonous
and
is
too
like
yesterday
and
is
too
like
but
i
am
afraid
said
i
this
is
an
objection
to
all
kinds
of
application
to
life
itself
except
under
some
very
uncommon
circumstances
do
you
think
so
returned
richard
still
considering
perhaps
ha
why
then
you
know
he
added
suddenly
becoming
gay
again
we
travel
outside
a
circle
to
what
i
said
just
now
it
do
as
well
as
anything
else
oh
it
all
right
enough
let
us
talk
about
something
else
but
even
ada
with
her
loving
face
and
if
it
had
seemed
innocent
and
trusting
when
i
first
saw
it
in
that
memorable
november
fog
how
much
more
did
it
seem
now
when
i
knew
her
innocent
and
trusting
heart
even
ada
shook
her
head
at
this
and
looked
serious
so
i
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
hint
to
richard
that
if
he
were
sometimes
a
little
careless
of
himself
i
was
very
sure
he
never
meant
to
be
careless
of
ada
and
that
it
was
a
part
of
his
affectionate
consideration
for
her
not
to
slight
the
importance
of
a
step
that
might
influence
both
their
lives
this
made
him
almost
grave
my
dear
mother
hubbard
he
said
that
the
very
thing
i
have
thought
of
that
several
times
and
have
been
quite
angry
with
myself
for
meaning
to
be
so
much
in
earnest
and
somehow
not
exactly
being
so
i
do
know
how
it
is
i
seem
to
want
something
or
other
to
stand
by
even
you
have
no
idea
how
fond
i
am
of
ada
my
darling
cousin
i
love
you
so
much
but
i
do
settle
down
to
constancy
in
other
things
it
such
uphill
work
and
it
takes
such
a
time
said
richard
with
an
air
of
vexation
that
may
be
i
suggested
because
you
do
like
what
you
have
chosen
poor
fellow
said
ada
i
am
sure
i
do
wonder
at
it
no
it
was
not
of
the
least
use
my
trying
to
look
wise
i
tried
again
but
how
could
i
do
it
or
how
could
it
have
any
effect
if
i
could
while
ada
rested
her
clasped
hands
upon
his
shoulder
and
while
he
looked
at
her
tender
blue
eyes
and
while
they
looked
at
him
you
see
my
precious
girl
said
richard
passing
her
golden
curls
through
and
through
his
hand
i
was
a
little
hasty
perhaps
or
i
misunderstood
my
own
inclinations
perhaps
they
do
seem
to
lie
in
that
direction
i
could
tell
till
i
tried
now
the
question
is
whether
it
to
undo
all
that
has
been
done
it
seems
like
making
a
great
disturbance
about
nothing
particular
my
dear
richard
said
i
how
can
you
say
about
nothing
particular
i
do
mean
absolutely
that
he
returned
i
mean
that
it
may
be
nothing
particular
because
i
may
never
want
it
both
ada
and
i
urged
in
reply
not
only
that
it
was
decidedly
to
undo
what
had
been
done
but
that
it
must
be
undone
i
then
asked
richard
whether
he
had
thought
of
any
more
congenial
pursuit
there
my
dear
shipton
said
richard
you
touch
me
home
yes
i
have
i
have
been
thinking
that
the
law
is
the
boy
for
me
the
law
repeated
ada
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
the
name
if
i
went
into
kenge
office
said
richard
and
if
i
were
placed
under
articles
to
kenge
i
should
have
my
eye
on
the
hum
the
forbidden
ground
and
should
be
able
to
study
it
and
master
it
and
to
satisfy
myself
that
it
was
not
neglected
and
was
being
properly
conducted
i
should
be
able
to
look
after
ada
interests
and
my
own
interests
the
same
thing
and
i
should
peg
away
at
blackstone
and
all
those
fellows
with
the
most
tremendous
ardour
i
was
not
by
any
means
so
sure
of
that
and
i
saw
how
his
hankering
after
the
vague
things
yet
to
come
of
those
hopes
cast
a
shade
on
ada
face
but
i
thought
it
best
to
encourage
him
in
any
project
of
continuous
exertion
and
only
advised
him
to
be
quite
sure
that
his
mind
was
made
up
now
my
dear
minerva
said
richard
i
am
as
steady
as
you
are
i
made
a
mistake
we
are
all
liable
to
mistakes
i
wo
do
so
any
more
and
i
become
such
a
lawyer
as
is
not
often
seen
that
is
you
know
said
richard
relapsing
into
doubt
if
it
really
is
after
all
to
make
such
a
disturbance
about
nothing
particular
this
led
to
our
saying
again
with
a
great
deal
of
gravity
all
that
we
had
said
already
and
to
our
coming
to
much
the
same
conclusion
afterwards
but
we
so
strongly
advised
richard
to
be
frank
and
open
with
jarndyce
without
a
moment
delay
and
his
disposition
was
naturally
so
opposed
to
concealment
that
he
sought
him
out
at
once
taking
us
with
him
and
made
a
full
avowal
rick
said
my
guardian
after
hearing
him
attentively
we
can
retreat
with
honour
and
we
will
but
we
must
be
careful
for
our
cousin
sake
rick
for
our
cousin
sake
that
we
make
no
more
such
mistakes
therefore
in
the
matter
of
the
law
we
will
have
a
good
trial
before
we
decide
we
will
look
before
we
leap
and
take
plenty
of
time
about
it
richard
energy
was
of
such
an
impatient
and
fitful
kind
that
he
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
have
gone
to
office
in
that
hour
and
to
have
entered
into
articles
with
him
on
the
spot
submitting
however
with
a
good
grace
to
the
caution
that
we
had
shown
to
be
so
necessary
he
contented
himself
with
sitting
down
among
us
in
his
lightest
spirits
and
talking
as
if
his
one
unvarying
purpose
in
life
from
childhood
had
been
that
one
which
now
held
possession
of
him
my
guardian
was
very
kind
and
cordial
with
him
but
rather
grave
enough
so
to
cause
ada
when
he
had
departed
and
we
were
going
upstairs
to
bed
to
say
cousin
john
i
hope
you
think
the
worse
of
richard
no
my
love
said
he
because
it
was
very
natural
that
richard
should
be
mistaken
in
such
a
difficult
case
it
is
not
uncommon
no
no
my
love
said
he
do
look
unhappy
oh
i
am
not
unhappy
cousin
john
said
ada
smiling
cheerfully
with
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
where
she
had
put
it
in
bidding
him
good
night
but
i
should
be
a
little
so
if
you
thought
at
all
the
worse
of
richard
my
dear
said
jarndyce
i
should
think
the
worse
of
him
only
if
you
were
ever
in
the
least
unhappy
through
his
means
i
should
be
more
disposed
to
quarrel
with
myself
even
then
than
with
poor
rick
for
i
brought
you
together
but
tut
all
this
is
nothing
he
has
time
before
him
and
the
race
to
run
i
think
the
worse
of
him
not
i
my
loving
cousin
and
not
you
i
swear
no
indeed
cousin
john
said
ada
i
am
sure
i
could
not
i
am
sure
i
would
not
think
any
ill
of
richard
if
the
whole
world
did
i
could
and
i
would
think
better
of
him
then
than
at
any
other
time
so
quietly
and
honestly
she
said
it
with
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
both
hands
now
and
looking
up
into
his
face
like
the
picture
of
truth
i
think
said
my
guardian
thoughtfully
regarding
her
i
think
it
must
be
somewhere
written
that
the
virtues
of
the
mothers
shall
occasionally
be
visited
on
the
children
as
well
as
the
sins
of
the
father
good
night
my
rosebud
good
night
little
woman
pleasant
slumbers
happy
dreams
this
was
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
follow
ada
with
his
eyes
with
something
of
a
shadow
on
their
benevolent
expression
i
well
remembered
the
look
with
which
he
had
contemplated
her
and
richard
when
she
was
singing
in
the
firelight
it
was
but
a
very
little
while
since
he
had
watched
them
passing
down
the
room
in
which
the
sun
was
shining
and
away
into
the
shade
but
his
glance
was
changed
and
even
the
silent
look
of
confidence
in
me
which
now
followed
it
once
more
was
not
quite
so
hopeful
and
untroubled
as
it
had
originally
been
ada
praised
richard
more
to
me
that
night
than
ever
she
had
praised
him
yet
she
went
to
sleep
with
a
little
bracelet
he
had
given
her
clasped
upon
her
arm
i
fancied
she
was
dreaming
of
him
when
i
kissed
her
cheek
after
she
had
slept
an
hour
and
saw
how
tranquil
and
happy
she
looked
for
i
was
so
little
inclined
to
sleep
myself
that
night
that
i
sat
up
working
it
would
not
be
worth
mentioning
for
its
own
sake
but
i
was
wakeful
and
rather
i
do
know
why
at
least
i
think
i
know
why
at
least
perhaps
i
do
but
i
do
think
it
matters
at
any
rate
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
so
dreadfully
industrious
that
i
would
leave
myself
not
a
moment
leisure
to
be
for
i
naturally
said
esther
you
to
be
you
and
it
really
was
time
to
say
so
for
i
yes
i
really
did
see
myself
in
the
glass
almost
crying
as
if
you
had
anything
to
make
you
unhappy
instead
of
everything
to
make
you
happy
you
ungrateful
heart
said
i
if
i
could
have
made
myself
go
to
sleep
i
would
have
done
it
directly
but
not
being
able
to
do
that
i
took
out
of
my
basket
some
ornamental
work
for
our
house
i
mean
bleak
house
that
i
was
busy
with
at
that
time
and
sat
down
to
it
with
great
determination
it
was
necessary
to
count
all
the
stitches
in
that
work
and
i
resolved
to
go
on
with
it
until
i
could
keep
my
eyes
open
and
then
to
go
to
bed
i
soon
found
myself
very
busy
but
i
had
left
some
silk
downstairs
in
a
drawer
in
the
temporary
growlery
and
coming
to
a
stop
for
want
of
it
i
took
my
candle
and
went
softly
down
to
get
it
to
my
great
surprise
on
going
in
i
found
my
guardian
still
there
and
sitting
looking
at
the
ashes
he
was
lost
in
thought
his
book
lay
unheeded
by
his
side
his
silvered
hair
was
scattered
confusedly
upon
his
forehead
as
though
his
hand
had
been
wandering
among
it
while
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
and
his
face
looked
worn
almost
frightened
by
coming
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
i
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
should
have
retired
without
speaking
had
he
not
in
again
passing
his
hand
abstractedly
through
his
hair
seen
me
and
started
esther
i
told
him
what
i
had
come
for
at
work
so
late
my
dear
i
am
working
late
said
i
because
i
could
sleep
and
wished
to
tire
myself
but
dear
guardian
you
are
late
too
and
look
weary
you
have
no
trouble
i
hope
to
keep
you
waking
none
little
woman
that
you
would
readily
understand
said
he
he
spoke
in
a
regretful
tone
so
new
to
me
that
i
inwardly
repeated
as
if
that
would
help
me
to
his
meaning
that
i
could
readily
understand
remain
a
moment
esther
said
he
you
were
in
my
thoughts
i
hope
i
was
not
the
trouble
guardian
he
slightly
waved
his
hand
and
fell
into
his
usual
manner
the
change
was
so
remarkable
and
he
appeared
to
make
it
by
dint
of
so
much
that
i
found
myself
again
inwardly
repeating
none
that
i
could
understand
little
woman
said
my
guardian
i
was
thinking
that
is
i
have
been
thinking
since
i
have
been
sitting
here
that
you
ought
to
know
of
your
own
history
all
i
know
it
is
very
little
next
to
nothing
dear
guardian
i
replied
when
you
spoke
to
me
before
on
that
subject
but
since
then
he
gravely
interposed
anticipating
what
i
meant
to
say
i
have
reflected
that
your
having
anything
to
ask
me
and
my
having
anything
to
tell
you
are
different
considerations
esther
it
is
perhaps
my
duty
to
impart
to
you
the
little
i
know
if
you
think
so
guardian
it
is
right
i
think
so
he
returned
very
gently
and
kindly
and
very
distinctly
my
dear
i
think
so
now
if
any
real
disadvantage
can
attach
to
your
position
in
the
mind
of
any
man
or
woman
worth
a
thought
it
is
right
that
you
at
least
of
all
the
world
should
not
magnify
it
to
yourself
by
having
vague
impressions
of
its
nature
i
sat
down
and
said
after
a
little
effort
to
be
as
calm
as
i
ought
to
be
one
of
my
earliest
remembrances
guardian
is
of
these
words
mother
esther
is
your
disgrace
and
you
were
hers
the
time
will
come
and
soon
enough
when
you
will
understand
this
better
and
will
feel
it
too
as
no
one
save
a
woman
can
i
had
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
in
repeating
the
words
but
i
took
them
away
now
with
a
better
kind
of
shame
i
hope
and
told
him
that
to
him
i
owed
the
blessing
that
i
had
from
my
childhood
to
that
hour
never
never
never
felt
it
he
put
up
his
hand
as
if
to
stop
me
i
well
knew
that
he
was
never
to
be
thanked
and
said
no
more
nine
years
my
dear
he
said
after
thinking
for
a
little
while
have
passed
since
i
received
a
letter
from
a
lady
living
in
seclusion
written
with
a
stern
passion
and
power
that
rendered
it
unlike
all
other
letters
i
have
ever
read
it
was
written
to
me
as
it
told
me
in
so
many
words
perhaps
because
it
was
the
idiosyncrasy
to
put
that
trust
in
me
perhaps
because
it
was
mine
to
justify
it
it
told
me
of
a
child
an
orphan
girl
then
twelve
years
old
in
some
such
cruel
words
as
those
which
live
in
your
remembrance
it
told
me
that
the
writer
had
bred
her
in
secrecy
from
her
birth
had
blotted
out
all
trace
of
her
existence
and
that
if
the
writer
were
to
die
before
the
child
became
a
woman
she
would
be
left
entirely
friendless
nameless
and
unknown
it
asked
me
to
consider
if
i
would
in
that
case
finish
what
the
writer
had
begun
i
listened
in
silence
and
looked
attentively
at
him
your
early
recollection
my
dear
will
supply
the
gloomy
medium
through
which
all
this
was
seen
and
expressed
by
the
writer
and
the
distorted
religion
which
clouded
her
mind
with
impressions
of
the
need
there
was
for
the
child
to
expiate
an
offence
of
which
she
was
quite
innocent
i
felt
concerned
for
the
little
creature
in
her
darkened
life
and
replied
to
the
letter
i
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
it
laid
the
injunction
on
me
that
i
should
never
propose
to
see
the
writer
who
had
long
been
estranged
from
all
intercourse
with
the
world
but
who
would
see
a
confidential
agent
if
i
would
appoint
one
i
accredited
kenge
the
lady
said
of
her
own
accord
and
not
of
his
seeking
that
her
name
was
an
assumed
one
that
she
was
if
there
were
any
ties
of
blood
in
such
a
case
the
child
aunt
that
more
than
this
she
would
never
and
he
was
well
persuaded
of
the
steadfastness
of
her
resolution
for
any
human
consideration
disclose
my
dear
i
have
told
you
all
i
held
his
hand
for
a
little
while
in
mine
i
saw
my
ward
oftener
than
she
saw
me
he
added
cheerily
making
light
of
it
and
i
always
knew
she
was
beloved
useful
and
happy
she
repays
me
and
twenty
more
to
that
every
hour
in
every
day
and
oftener
still
said
i
she
blesses
the
guardian
who
is
a
father
to
her
at
the
word
father
i
saw
his
former
trouble
come
into
his
face
he
subdued
it
as
before
and
it
was
gone
in
an
instant
but
it
had
been
there
and
it
had
come
so
swiftly
upon
my
words
that
i
felt
as
if
they
had
given
him
a
shock
i
again
inwardly
repeated
wondering
that
i
could
readily
understand
none
that
i
could
readily
understand
no
it
was
true
i
did
not
understand
it
not
for
many
and
many
a
day
take
a
fatherly
good
night
my
dear
said
he
kissing
me
on
the
forehead
and
so
to
rest
these
are
late
hours
for
working
and
thinking
you
do
that
for
all
of
us
all
day
long
little
housekeeper
i
neither
worked
nor
thought
any
more
that
night
i
opened
my
grateful
heart
to
heaven
in
thankfulness
for
its
providence
to
me
and
its
care
of
me
and
fell
asleep
we
had
a
visitor
next
day
allan
woodcourt
came
he
came
to
take
leave
of
us
he
had
settled
to
do
so
beforehand
he
was
going
to
china
and
to
india
as
a
surgeon
on
board
ship
he
was
to
be
away
a
long
long
time
i
believe
at
least
i
know
that
he
was
not
rich
all
his
widowed
mother
could
spare
had
been
spent
in
qualifying
him
for
his
profession
it
was
not
lucrative
to
a
young
practitioner
with
very
little
influence
in
london
and
although
he
was
night
and
day
at
the
service
of
numbers
of
poor
people
and
did
wonders
of
gentleness
and
skill
for
them
he
gained
very
little
by
it
in
money
he
was
seven
years
older
than
i
not
that
i
need
mention
it
for
it
hardly
seems
to
belong
to
anything
i
think
i
mean
he
told
us
that
he
had
been
in
practice
three
or
four
years
and
that
if
he
could
have
hoped
to
contend
through
three
or
four
more
he
would
not
have
made
the
voyage
on
which
he
was
bound
but
he
had
no
fortune
or
private
means
and
so
he
was
going
away
he
had
been
to
see
us
several
times
altogether
we
thought
it
a
pity
he
should
go
away
because
he
was
distinguished
in
his
art
among
those
who
knew
it
best
and
some
of
the
greatest
men
belonging
to
it
had
a
high
opinion
of
him
when
he
came
to
bid
us
he
brought
his
mother
with
him
for
the
first
time
she
was
a
pretty
old
lady
with
bright
black
eyes
but
she
seemed
proud
she
came
from
wales
and
had
had
a
long
time
ago
an
eminent
person
for
an
ancestor
of
the
name
of
morgan
of
some
place
that
sounded
like
gimlet
who
was
the
most
illustrious
person
that
ever
was
known
and
all
of
whose
relations
were
a
sort
of
royal
family
he
appeared
to
have
passed
his
life
in
always
getting
up
into
mountains
and
fighting
somebody
and
a
bard
whose
name
sounded
like
crumlinwallinwer
had
sung
his
praises
in
a
piece
which
was
called
as
nearly
as
i
could
catch
it
mewlinnwillinwodd
woodcourt
after
expatiating
to
us
on
the
fame
of
her
great
kinsman
said
that
no
doubt
wherever
her
son
allan
went
he
would
remember
his
pedigree
and
would
on
no
account
form
an
alliance
below
it
she
told
him
that
there
were
many
handsome
english
ladies
in
india
who
went
out
on
speculation
and
that
there
were
some
to
be
picked
up
with
property
but
that
neither
charms
nor
wealth
would
suffice
for
the
descendant
from
such
a
line
without
birth
which
must
ever
be
the
first
consideration
she
talked
so
much
about
birth
that
for
a
moment
i
half
fancied
and
with
pain
but
what
an
idle
fancy
to
suppose
that
she
could
think
or
care
what
mine
was
woodcourt
seemed
a
little
distressed
by
her
prolixity
but
he
was
too
considerate
to
let
her
see
it
and
contrived
delicately
to
bring
the
conversation
round
to
making
his
acknowledgments
to
my
guardian
for
his
hospitality
and
for
the
very
happy
hours
he
called
them
the
very
happy
hours
he
had
passed
with
us
the
recollection
of
them
he
said
would
go
with
him
wherever
he
went
and
would
be
always
treasured
and
so
we
gave
him
our
hands
one
after
another
at
least
they
did
and
i
did
and
so
he
put
his
lips
to
ada
hand
and
to
mine
and
so
he
went
away
upon
his
long
long
voyage
i
was
very
busy
indeed
all
day
and
wrote
directions
home
to
the
servants
and
wrote
notes
for
my
guardian
and
dusted
his
books
and
papers
and
jingled
my
housekeeping
keys
a
good
deal
one
way
and
another
i
was
still
busy
between
the
lights
singing
and
working
by
the
window
when
who
should
come
in
but
caddy
whom
i
had
no
expectation
of
seeing
why
caddy
my
dear
said
i
what
beautiful
flowers
she
had
such
an
exquisite
little
nosegay
in
her
hand
indeed
i
think
so
esther
replied
caddy
they
are
the
loveliest
i
ever
saw
prince
my
dear
said
i
in
a
whisper
no
answered
caddy
shaking
her
head
and
holding
them
to
me
to
smell
not
prince
well
to
be
sure
caddy
said
i
you
must
have
two
lovers
what
do
they
look
like
that
sort
of
thing
said
caddy
do
they
look
like
that
sort
of
thing
i
repeated
pinching
her
cheek
caddy
only
laughed
in
return
and
telling
me
that
she
had
come
for
half
an
hour
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
prince
would
be
waiting
for
her
at
the
corner
sat
chatting
with
me
and
ada
in
the
window
every
now
and
then
handing
me
the
flowers
again
or
trying
how
they
looked
against
my
hair
at
last
when
she
was
going
she
took
me
into
my
room
and
put
them
in
my
dress
for
me
said
i
surprised
for
you
said
caddy
with
a
kiss
they
were
left
behind
by
somebody
left
behind
at
poor
miss
flite
said
caddy
somebody
who
has
been
very
good
to
her
was
hurrying
away
an
hour
ago
to
join
a
ship
and
left
these
flowers
behind
no
no
do
take
them
out
let
the
pretty
little
things
lie
here
said
caddy
adjusting
them
with
a
careful
hand
because
i
was
present
myself
and
i
should
wonder
if
somebody
left
them
on
purpose
do
they
look
like
that
sort
of
thing
said
ada
coming
laughingly
behind
me
and
clasping
me
merrily
round
the
waist
oh
yes
indeed
they
do
dame
durden
they
look
very
very
like
that
sort
of
thing
oh
very
like
it
indeed
my
dear
chapter
xviii
lady
dedlock
it
was
not
so
easy
as
it
had
appeared
at
first
to
arrange
for
richard
making
a
trial
of
kenge
office
richard
himself
was
the
chief
impediment
as
soon
as
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
leave
badger
at
any
moment
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
wanted
to
leave
him
at
all
he
did
know
he
said
really
it
was
a
bad
profession
he
could
assert
that
he
disliked
it
perhaps
he
liked
it
as
well
as
he
liked
any
other
suppose
he
gave
it
one
more
chance
upon
that
he
shut
himself
up
for
a
few
weeks
with
some
books
and
some
bones
and
seemed
to
acquire
a
considerable
fund
of
information
with
great
rapidity
his
fervour
after
lasting
about
a
month
began
to
cool
and
when
it
was
quite
cooled
began
to
grow
warm
again
his
vacillations
between
law
and
medicine
lasted
so
long
that
midsummer
arrived
before
he
finally
separated
from
badger
and
entered
on
an
experimental
course
of
kenge
and
carboy
for
all
his
waywardness
he
took
great
credit
to
himself
as
being
determined
to
be
in
earnest
this
time
and
he
was
so
throughout
and
in
such
high
spirits
and
so
fond
of
ada
that
it
was
very
difficult
indeed
to
be
otherwise
than
pleased
with
him
as
to
jarndyce
who
i
may
mention
found
the
wind
much
given
during
this
period
to
stick
in
the
east
as
to
jarndyce
richard
would
say
to
me
he
is
the
finest
fellow
in
the
world
esther
i
must
be
particularly
careful
if
it
were
only
for
his
satisfaction
to
take
myself
well
to
task
and
have
a
regular
of
this
business
now
the
idea
of
his
taking
himself
well
to
task
with
that
laughing
face
and
heedless
manner
and
with
a
fancy
that
everything
could
catch
and
nothing
could
hold
was
ludicrously
anomalous
however
he
told
us
that
he
was
doing
it
to
such
an
extent
that
he
wondered
his
hair
did
turn
grey
his
regular
of
the
business
was
as
i
have
said
that
he
went
to
kenge
about
midsummer
to
try
how
he
liked
it
all
this
time
he
was
in
money
affairs
what
i
have
described
him
in
a
former
illustration
generous
profuse
wildly
careless
but
fully
persuaded
that
he
was
rather
calculating
and
prudent
i
happened
to
say
to
ada
in
his
presence
half
jestingly
half
seriously
about
the
time
of
his
going
to
kenge
that
he
needed
to
have
fortunatus
purse
he
made
so
light
of
money
which
he
answered
in
this
way
my
jewel
of
a
dear
cousin
you
hear
this
old
woman
why
does
she
say
that
because
i
gave
eight
pounds
odd
or
whatever
it
was
for
a
certain
neat
waistcoat
and
buttons
a
few
days
ago
now
if
i
had
stayed
at
badger
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
spend
twelve
pounds
at
a
blow
for
some
so
i
make
four
pounds
in
a
lump
by
the
transaction
it
was
a
question
much
discussed
between
him
and
my
guardian
what
arrangements
should
be
made
for
his
living
in
london
while
he
experimented
on
the
law
for
we
had
long
since
gone
back
to
bleak
house
and
it
was
too
far
off
to
admit
of
his
coming
there
oftener
than
once
a
week
my
guardian
told
me
that
if
richard
were
to
settle
down
at
kenge
he
would
take
some
apartments
or
chambers
where
we
too
could
occasionally
stay
for
a
few
days
at
a
time
but
little
woman
he
added
rubbing
his
head
very
significantly
he
settled
down
there
yet
the
discussions
ended
in
our
hiring
for
him
by
the
month
a
neat
little
furnished
lodging
in
a
quiet
old
house
near
queen
square
he
immediately
began
to
spend
all
the
money
he
had
in
buying
the
oddest
little
ornaments
and
luxuries
for
this
lodging
and
so
often
as
ada
and
i
dissuaded
him
from
making
any
purchase
that
he
had
in
contemplation
which
was
particularly
unnecessary
and
expensive
he
took
credit
for
what
it
would
have
cost
and
made
out
that
to
spend
anything
less
on
something
else
was
to
save
the
difference
while
these
affairs
were
in
abeyance
our
visit
to
boythorn
was
postponed
at
length
richard
having
taken
possession
of
his
lodging
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
our
departure
he
could
have
gone
with
us
at
that
time
of
the
year
very
well
but
he
was
in
the
full
novelty
of
his
new
position
and
was
making
most
energetic
attempts
to
unravel
the
mysteries
of
the
fatal
suit
consequently
we
went
without
him
and
my
darling
was
delighted
to
praise
him
for
being
so
busy
we
made
a
pleasant
journey
down
into
lincolnshire
by
the
coach
and
had
an
entertaining
companion
in
skimpole
his
furniture
had
been
all
cleared
off
it
appeared
by
the
person
who
took
possession
of
it
on
his
daughter
birthday
but
he
seemed
quite
relieved
to
think
that
it
was
gone
chairs
and
table
he
said
were
wearisome
objects
they
were
monotonous
ideas
they
had
no
variety
of
expression
they
looked
you
out
of
countenance
and
you
looked
them
out
of
countenance
how
pleasant
then
to
be
bound
to
no
particular
chairs
and
tables
but
to
sport
like
a
butterfly
among
all
the
furniture
on
hire
and
to
flit
from
rosewood
to
mahogany
and
from
mahogany
to
walnut
and
from
this
shape
to
that
as
the
humour
took
one
the
oddity
of
the
thing
is
said
skimpole
with
a
quickened
sense
of
the
ludicrous
that
my
chairs
and
tables
were
not
paid
for
and
yet
my
landlord
walks
off
with
them
as
composedly
as
possible
now
that
seems
droll
there
is
something
grotesque
in
it
the
chair
and
table
merchant
never
engaged
to
pay
my
landlord
my
rent
why
should
my
landlord
quarrel
with
him
if
i
have
a
pimple
on
my
nose
which
is
disagreeable
to
my
landlord
peculiar
ideas
of
beauty
my
landlord
has
no
business
to
scratch
my
chair
and
table
nose
which
has
no
pimple
on
it
his
reasoning
seems
defective
well
said
my
guardian
it
pretty
clear
that
whoever
became
security
for
those
chairs
and
tables
will
have
to
pay
for
them
exactly
returned
skimpole
that
the
crowning
point
of
unreason
in
the
business
i
said
to
my
landlord
good
man
you
are
not
aware
that
my
excellent
friend
jarndyce
will
have
to
pay
for
those
things
that
you
are
sweeping
off
in
that
indelicate
manner
have
you
no
consideration
for
his
property
he
had
the
least
and
refused
all
proposals
said
my
guardian
refused
all
proposals
returned
skimpole
i
made
him
business
proposals
i
had
him
into
my
room
i
said
are
a
man
of
business
i
believe
he
replied
am
well
said
i
let
us
be
here
is
an
inkstand
here
are
pens
and
paper
here
are
wafers
what
do
you
want
i
have
occupied
your
house
for
a
considerable
period
i
believe
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
until
this
unpleasant
misunderstanding
arose
let
us
be
at
once
friendly
and
what
do
you
want
in
reply
to
this
he
made
use
of
the
figurative
expression
which
has
something
eastern
about
it
that
he
had
never
seen
the
colour
of
my
money
amiable
friend
said
i
never
have
any
money
i
never
know
anything
about
money
sir
said
he
do
you
offer
if
i
give
you
time
good
fellow
said
i
have
no
idea
of
time
but
you
say
you
are
a
man
of
business
and
whatever
you
can
suggest
to
be
done
in
a
way
with
pen
and
ink
and
paper
and
wafers
i
am
ready
to
do
do
pay
yourself
at
another
man
expense
which
is
foolish
but
be
however
he
would
be
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
if
these
were
some
of
the
inconveniences
of
skimpole
childhood
it
assuredly
possessed
its
advantages
too
on
the
journey
he
had
a
very
good
appetite
for
such
refreshment
as
came
in
our
way
including
a
basket
of
choice
hothouse
peaches
but
never
thought
of
paying
for
anything
so
when
the
coachman
came
round
for
his
fee
he
pleasantly
asked
him
what
he
considered
a
very
good
fee
indeed
now
a
liberal
one
and
on
his
replying
half
a
crown
for
a
single
passenger
said
it
was
little
enough
too
all
things
considered
and
left
jarndyce
to
give
it
him
it
was
delightful
weather
the
green
corn
waved
so
beautifully
the
larks
sang
so
joyfully
the
hedges
were
so
full
of
wild
flowers
the
trees
were
so
thickly
out
in
leaf
the
with
a
light
wind
blowing
over
them
filled
the
air
with
such
a
delicious
fragrance
late
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
the
where
we
were
to
alight
from
the
coach
a
dull
little
town
with
a
and
a
marketplace
and
a
and
one
intensely
sunny
street
and
a
pond
with
an
old
horse
cooling
his
legs
in
it
and
a
very
few
men
sleepily
lying
and
standing
about
in
narrow
little
bits
of
shade
after
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
the
waving
of
the
corn
all
along
the
road
it
looked
as
still
as
hot
as
motionless
a
little
town
as
england
could
produce
at
the
inn
we
found
boythorn
on
horseback
waiting
with
an
open
carriage
to
take
us
to
his
house
which
was
a
few
miles
off
he
was
overjoyed
to
see
us
and
dismounted
with
great
alacrity
by
heaven
said
he
after
giving
us
a
courteous
greeting
this
a
most
infamous
coach
it
is
the
most
flagrant
example
of
an
abominable
public
vehicle
that
ever
encumbered
the
face
of
the
earth
it
is
minutes
after
its
time
this
afternoon
the
coachman
ought
to
be
put
to
death
is
he
after
his
time
said
skimpole
to
whom
he
happened
to
address
himself
you
know
my
infirmity
minutes
minutes
replied
boythorn
referring
to
his
watch
with
two
ladies
in
the
coach
this
scoundrel
has
deliberately
delayed
his
arrival
six
and
twenty
minutes
deliberately
it
is
impossible
that
it
can
be
accidental
but
his
father
and
his
uncle
were
the
most
profligate
coachmen
that
ever
sat
upon
a
box
while
he
said
this
in
tones
of
the
greatest
indignation
he
handed
us
into
the
little
phaeton
with
the
utmost
gentleness
and
was
all
smiles
and
pleasure
i
am
sorry
ladies
he
said
standing
at
the
when
all
was
ready
that
i
am
obliged
to
conduct
you
nearly
two
miles
out
of
the
way
but
our
direct
road
lies
through
sir
leicester
dedlock
park
and
in
that
fellow
property
i
have
sworn
never
to
set
foot
of
mine
or
horse
foot
of
mine
pending
the
present
relations
between
us
while
i
breathe
the
breath
of
life
and
here
catching
my
guardian
eye
he
broke
into
one
of
his
tremendous
laughs
which
seemed
to
shake
even
the
motionless
little
are
the
dedlocks
down
here
lawrence
said
my
guardian
as
we
drove
along
and
boythorn
trotted
on
the
green
turf
by
the
roadside
sir
arrogant
numskull
is
here
replied
boythorn
ha
ha
ha
sir
arrogant
is
here
and
i
am
glad
to
say
has
been
laid
by
the
heels
here
my
lady
in
naming
whom
he
always
made
a
courtly
gesture
as
if
particularly
to
exclude
her
from
any
part
in
the
quarrel
is
expected
i
believe
daily
i
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
that
she
postpones
her
appearance
as
long
as
possible
whatever
can
have
induced
that
transcendent
woman
to
marry
that
effigy
and
of
a
baronet
is
one
of
the
most
impenetrable
mysteries
that
ever
baffled
human
inquiry
ha
ha
ha
ha
i
suppose
said
my
guardian
laughing
we
may
set
foot
in
the
park
while
we
are
here
the
prohibition
does
not
extend
to
us
does
it
i
can
lay
no
prohibition
on
my
guests
he
said
bending
his
head
to
ada
and
me
with
the
smiling
politeness
which
sat
so
gracefully
upon
him
except
in
the
matter
of
their
departure
i
am
only
sorry
that
i
can
not
have
the
happiness
of
being
their
escort
about
chesney
wold
which
is
a
very
fine
place
but
by
the
light
of
this
summer
day
jarndyce
if
you
call
upon
the
owner
while
you
stay
with
me
you
are
likely
to
have
but
a
cool
reception
he
carries
himself
like
an
clock
at
all
times
like
one
of
a
race
of
clocks
in
gorgeous
cases
that
never
go
and
never
went
ha
ha
ha
but
he
will
have
some
extra
stiffness
i
can
promise
you
for
the
friends
of
his
friend
and
neighbour
boythorn
i
shall
not
put
him
to
the
proof
said
my
guardian
he
is
as
indifferent
to
the
honour
of
knowing
me
i
dare
say
as
i
am
to
the
honour
of
knowing
him
the
air
of
the
grounds
and
perhaps
such
a
view
of
the
house
as
any
other
sightseer
might
get
are
quite
enough
for
me
well
said
boythorn
i
am
glad
of
it
on
the
whole
it
in
better
keeping
i
am
looked
upon
about
here
as
a
second
ajax
defying
the
lightning
ha
ha
ha
ha
when
i
go
into
our
little
church
on
a
sunday
a
considerable
part
of
the
inconsiderable
congregation
expect
to
see
me
drop
scorched
and
withered
on
the
pavement
under
the
dedlock
displeasure
ha
ha
ha
ha
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
surprised
that
i
do
for
he
is
by
heaven
the
most
and
the
shallowest
and
the
most
coxcombical
and
utterly
brainless
ass
our
coming
to
the
ridge
of
a
hill
we
had
been
ascending
enabled
our
friend
to
point
out
chesney
wold
itself
to
us
and
diverted
his
attention
from
its
master
it
was
a
picturesque
old
house
in
a
fine
park
richly
wooded
among
the
trees
and
not
far
from
the
residence
he
pointed
out
the
spire
of
the
little
church
of
which
he
had
spoken
oh
the
solemn
woods
over
which
the
light
and
shadow
travelled
swiftly
as
if
heavenly
wings
were
sweeping
on
benignant
errands
through
the
summer
air
the
smooth
green
slopes
the
glittering
water
the
garden
where
the
flowers
were
so
symmetrically
arranged
in
clusters
of
the
richest
colours
how
beautiful
they
looked
the
house
with
gable
and
chimney
and
tower
and
turret
and
dark
doorway
and
broad
twining
among
the
balustrades
of
which
and
lying
heaped
upon
the
vases
there
was
one
great
flush
of
roses
seemed
scarcely
real
in
its
light
solidity
and
in
the
serene
and
peaceful
hush
that
rested
on
all
around
it
to
ada
and
to
me
that
above
all
appeared
the
pervading
influence
on
everything
house
garden
terrace
green
slopes
water
old
oaks
fern
moss
woods
again
and
far
away
across
the
openings
in
the
prospect
to
the
distance
lying
wide
before
us
with
a
purple
bloom
upon
it
there
seemed
to
be
such
undisturbed
repose
when
we
came
into
the
little
village
and
passed
a
small
inn
with
the
sign
of
the
dedlock
arms
swinging
over
the
road
in
front
boythorn
interchanged
greetings
with
a
young
gentleman
sitting
on
a
bench
outside
the
who
had
some
lying
beside
him
that
the
housekeeper
grandson
rouncewell
by
name
said
he
and
he
is
in
love
with
a
pretty
girl
up
at
the
house
lady
dedlock
has
taken
a
fancy
to
the
pretty
girl
and
is
going
to
keep
her
about
her
own
fair
person
an
honour
which
my
young
friend
himself
does
not
at
all
appreciate
however
he
ca
marry
just
yet
even
if
his
rosebud
were
willing
so
he
is
fain
to
make
the
best
of
it
in
the
meanwhile
he
comes
here
pretty
often
for
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
to
fish
ha
ha
ha
ha
are
he
and
the
pretty
girl
engaged
mr
boythorn
asked
ada
why
my
dear
miss
clare
he
returned
i
think
they
may
perhaps
understand
each
other
but
you
will
see
them
soon
i
dare
say
and
i
must
learn
from
you
on
such
a
point
not
you
from
me
ada
blushed
and
boythorn
trotting
forward
on
his
comely
grey
horse
dismounted
at
his
own
door
and
stood
ready
with
extended
arm
and
uncovered
head
to
welcome
us
when
we
arrived
he
lived
in
a
pretty
house
formerly
the
parsonage
house
with
a
lawn
in
front
a
bright
at
the
side
and
a
orchard
and
in
the
rear
enclosed
with
a
venerable
wall
that
had
of
itself
a
ripened
ruddy
look
but
indeed
everything
about
the
place
wore
an
aspect
of
maturity
and
abundance
the
old
walk
was
like
green
cloisters
the
very
shadows
of
the
and
were
heavy
with
fruit
the
were
so
laden
that
their
branches
arched
and
rested
on
the
earth
the
strawberries
and
raspberries
grew
in
like
profusion
and
the
peaches
basked
by
the
hundred
on
the
wall
tumbled
about
among
the
spread
nets
and
the
glass
frames
sparkling
and
winking
in
the
sun
there
were
such
heaps
of
drooping
pods
and
marrows
and
cucumbers
that
every
foot
of
ground
appeared
a
vegetable
treasury
while
the
smell
of
sweet
herbs
and
all
kinds
of
wholesome
growth
to
say
nothing
of
the
neighbouring
meadows
where
the
hay
was
carrying
made
the
whole
air
a
great
nosegay
such
stillness
and
composure
reigned
within
the
orderly
precincts
of
the
old
red
wall
that
even
the
feathers
hung
in
garlands
to
scare
the
birds
hardly
stirred
and
the
wall
had
such
a
ripening
influence
that
where
here
and
there
high
up
a
disused
nail
and
scrap
of
list
still
clung
to
it
it
was
easy
to
fancy
that
they
had
mellowed
with
the
changing
seasons
and
that
they
had
rusted
and
decayed
according
to
the
common
fate
the
house
though
a
little
disorderly
in
comparison
with
the
garden
was
a
real
old
house
with
settles
in
the
chimney
of
the
kitchen
and
great
beams
across
the
ceilings
on
one
side
of
it
was
the
terrible
piece
of
ground
in
dispute
where
boythorn
maintained
a
sentry
in
a
day
and
night
whose
duty
was
supposed
to
be
in
cases
of
aggression
immediately
to
ring
a
large
bell
hung
up
there
for
the
purpose
to
unchain
a
great
established
in
a
kennel
as
his
ally
and
generally
to
deal
destruction
on
the
enemy
not
content
with
these
precautions
boythorn
had
himself
composed
and
posted
there
on
painted
boards
to
which
his
name
was
attached
in
large
letters
the
following
solemn
warnings
beware
of
the
he
is
most
ferocious
lawrence
boythorn
the
blunderbus
is
loaded
with
slugs
lawrence
boythorn
and
are
set
here
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
night
lawrence
boythorn
take
notice
that
any
person
or
persons
audaciously
presuming
to
trespass
on
this
property
will
be
punished
with
the
utmost
severity
of
private
chastisement
and
prosecuted
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
lawrence
boythorn
these
he
showed
us
from
the
window
while
his
bird
was
hopping
about
his
head
and
he
laughed
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
to
that
extent
as
he
pointed
them
out
that
i
really
thought
he
would
have
hurt
himself
but
this
is
taking
a
good
deal
of
trouble
said
skimpole
in
his
light
way
when
you
are
not
in
earnest
after
all
not
in
earnest
returned
boythorn
with
unspeakable
warmth
not
in
earnest
if
i
could
have
hoped
to
train
him
i
would
have
bought
a
lion
instead
of
that
dog
and
would
have
turned
him
loose
upon
the
first
intolerable
robber
who
should
dare
to
make
an
encroachment
on
my
rights
let
sir
leicester
dedlock
consent
to
come
out
and
decide
this
question
by
single
combat
and
i
will
meet
him
with
any
weapon
known
to
mankind
in
any
age
or
country
i
am
that
much
in
earnest
not
more
we
arrived
at
his
house
on
a
saturday
on
the
sunday
morning
we
all
set
forth
to
walk
to
the
little
church
in
the
park
entering
the
park
almost
immediately
by
the
disputed
ground
we
pursued
a
pleasant
footpath
winding
among
the
verdant
turf
and
the
beautiful
trees
until
it
brought
us
to
the
the
congregation
was
extremely
small
and
quite
a
rustic
one
with
the
exception
of
a
large
muster
of
servants
from
the
house
some
of
whom
were
already
in
their
seats
while
others
were
yet
dropping
in
there
were
some
stately
footmen
and
there
was
a
perfect
picture
of
an
old
coachman
who
looked
as
if
he
were
the
official
representative
of
all
the
pomps
and
vanities
that
had
ever
been
put
into
his
coach
there
was
a
very
pretty
show
of
young
women
and
above
them
the
handsome
old
face
and
fine
responsible
portly
figure
of
the
housekeeper
towered
the
pretty
girl
of
whom
boythorn
had
told
us
was
close
by
her
she
was
so
very
pretty
that
i
might
have
known
her
by
her
beauty
even
if
i
had
not
seen
how
blushingly
conscious
she
was
of
the
eyes
of
the
young
fisherman
whom
i
discovered
not
far
off
one
face
and
not
an
agreeable
one
though
it
was
handsome
seemed
maliciously
watchful
of
this
pretty
girl
and
indeed
of
every
one
and
everything
there
it
was
a
frenchwoman
as
the
bell
was
yet
ringing
and
the
great
people
were
not
yet
come
i
had
leisure
to
glance
over
the
church
which
smelt
as
earthy
as
a
grave
and
to
think
what
a
shady
ancient
solemn
little
church
it
was
the
windows
heavily
shaded
by
trees
admitted
a
subdued
light
that
made
the
faces
around
me
pale
and
darkened
the
old
brasses
in
the
pavement
and
the
time
and
monuments
and
rendered
the
sunshine
in
the
little
porch
where
a
monotonous
ringer
was
working
at
the
bell
inestimably
bright
but
a
stir
in
that
direction
a
gathering
of
reverential
awe
in
the
rustic
faces
and
a
blandly
ferocious
assumption
on
the
part
of
boythorn
of
being
resolutely
unconscious
of
somebody
existence
forewarned
me
that
the
great
people
were
come
and
that
the
service
was
going
to
begin
not
into
judgment
with
thy
servant
o
lord
for
in
thy
sight
shall
i
ever
forget
the
rapid
beating
at
my
heart
occasioned
by
the
look
i
met
as
i
stood
up
shall
i
ever
forget
the
manner
in
which
those
handsome
proud
eyes
seemed
to
spring
out
of
their
languor
and
to
hold
mine
it
was
only
a
moment
before
i
cast
mine
down
released
again
if
i
may
say
so
on
my
book
but
i
knew
the
beautiful
face
quite
well
in
that
short
space
of
time
and
very
strangely
there
was
something
quickened
within
me
associated
with
the
lonely
days
at
my
godmother
yes
away
even
to
the
days
when
i
had
stood
on
tiptoe
to
dress
myself
at
my
little
glass
after
dressing
my
doll
and
this
although
i
had
never
seen
this
lady
face
before
in
all
my
life
i
was
quite
sure
of
it
absolutely
certain
it
was
easy
to
know
that
the
ceremonious
gouty
gentleman
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
great
pew
was
sir
leicester
dedlock
and
that
the
lady
was
lady
dedlock
but
why
her
face
should
be
in
a
confused
way
like
a
broken
glass
to
me
in
which
i
saw
scraps
of
old
remembrances
and
why
i
should
be
so
fluttered
and
troubled
for
i
was
still
by
having
casually
met
her
eyes
i
could
not
think
i
felt
it
to
be
an
unmeaning
weakness
in
me
and
tried
to
overcome
it
by
attending
to
the
words
i
heard
then
very
strangely
i
seemed
to
hear
them
not
in
the
reader
voice
but
in
the
voice
of
my
godmother
this
made
me
think
did
lady
dedlock
face
accidentally
resemble
my
godmother
it
might
be
that
it
did
a
little
but
the
expression
was
so
different
and
the
stern
decision
which
had
worn
into
my
godmother
face
like
weather
into
rocks
was
so
completely
wanting
in
the
face
before
me
that
it
could
not
be
that
resemblance
which
had
struck
me
neither
did
i
know
the
loftiness
and
haughtiness
of
lady
dedlock
face
at
all
in
any
one
and
yet
i
i
little
esther
summerson
the
child
who
lived
a
life
apart
and
on
whose
birthday
there
was
no
rejoicing
seemed
to
arise
before
my
own
eyes
evoked
out
of
the
past
by
some
power
in
this
fashionable
lady
whom
i
not
only
entertained
no
fancy
that
i
had
ever
seen
but
whom
i
perfectly
well
knew
i
had
never
seen
until
that
hour
it
made
me
tremble
so
to
be
thrown
into
this
unaccountable
agitation
that
i
was
conscious
of
being
distressed
even
by
the
observation
of
the
french
maid
though
i
knew
she
had
been
looking
watchfully
here
and
there
and
everywhere
from
the
moment
of
her
coming
into
the
church
by
degrees
though
very
slowly
i
at
last
overcame
my
strange
emotion
after
a
long
time
i
looked
towards
lady
dedlock
again
it
was
while
they
were
preparing
to
sing
before
the
sermon
she
took
no
heed
of
me
and
the
beating
at
my
heart
was
gone
neither
did
it
revive
for
more
than
a
few
moments
when
she
once
or
twice
afterwards
glanced
at
ada
or
at
me
through
her
glass
the
service
being
concluded
sir
leicester
gave
his
arm
with
much
taste
and
gallantry
to
lady
dedlock
though
he
was
obliged
to
walk
by
the
help
of
a
thick
stick
and
escorted
her
out
of
church
to
the
pony
carriage
in
which
they
had
come
the
servants
then
dispersed
and
so
did
the
congregation
whom
sir
leicester
had
contemplated
all
along
skimpole
said
to
boythorn
infinite
delight
as
if
he
were
a
considerable
landed
proprietor
in
heaven
he
believes
he
is
said
boythorn
he
firmly
believes
it
so
did
his
father
and
his
grandfather
and
his
do
you
know
pursued
skimpole
very
unexpectedly
to
boythorn
it
agreeable
to
me
to
see
a
man
of
that
sort
is
it
said
boythorn
say
that
he
wants
to
patronize
me
pursued
skimpole
very
well
i
do
object
i
do
said
boythorn
with
great
vigour
do
you
really
returned
skimpole
in
his
easy
light
vein
but
that
taking
trouble
surely
and
why
should
you
take
trouble
here
am
i
content
to
receive
things
childishly
as
they
fall
out
and
i
never
take
trouble
i
come
down
here
for
instance
and
i
find
a
mighty
potentate
exacting
homage
very
well
i
say
potentate
here
is
my
homage
it
easier
to
give
it
than
to
withhold
it
here
it
is
if
you
have
anything
of
an
agreeable
nature
to
show
me
i
shall
be
happy
to
see
it
if
you
have
anything
of
an
agreeable
nature
to
give
me
i
shall
be
happy
to
accept
it
mighty
potentate
replies
in
effect
is
a
sensible
fellow
i
find
him
accord
with
my
digestion
and
my
bilious
system
he
does
impose
upon
me
the
necessity
of
rolling
myself
up
like
a
hedgehog
with
my
points
outward
i
expand
i
open
i
turn
my
silver
lining
outward
like
milton
cloud
and
it
more
agreeable
to
both
of
us
that
my
view
of
such
things
speaking
as
a
child
but
suppose
you
went
down
somewhere
else
said
boythorn
where
there
was
the
opposite
of
that
fellow
or
of
this
fellow
how
then
how
then
said
skimpole
with
an
appearance
of
the
utmost
simplicity
and
candour
just
the
same
then
i
should
say
esteemed
boythorn
to
make
you
the
personification
of
our
imaginary
friend
esteemed
boythorn
you
object
to
the
mighty
potentate
very
good
so
do
i
take
it
that
my
business
in
the
social
system
is
to
be
agreeable
i
take
it
that
everybody
business
in
the
social
system
is
to
be
agreeable
it
a
system
of
harmony
in
short
therefore
if
you
object
i
object
now
excellent
boythorn
let
us
go
to
dinner
but
excellent
boythorn
might
say
returned
our
host
swelling
and
growing
very
red
i
be
i
understand
said
skimpole
very
likely
he
would
if
i
will
go
to
dinner
cried
boythorn
in
a
violent
burst
and
stopping
to
strike
his
stick
upon
the
ground
and
he
would
probably
add
there
such
a
thing
as
principle
harold
skimpole
to
which
harold
skimpole
would
reply
you
know
he
returned
in
his
gayest
manner
and
with
his
most
ingenuous
smile
my
life
i
have
not
the
least
idea
i
do
know
what
it
is
you
call
by
that
name
or
where
it
is
or
who
possesses
it
if
you
possess
it
and
find
it
comfortable
i
am
quite
delighted
and
congratulate
you
heartily
but
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
assure
you
for
i
am
a
mere
child
and
i
lay
no
claim
to
it
and
i
do
want
it
so
you
see
excellent
boythorn
and
i
would
go
to
dinner
after
all
this
was
one
of
many
little
dialogues
between
them
which
i
always
expected
to
end
and
which
i
dare
say
would
have
ended
under
other
circumstances
in
some
violent
explosion
on
the
part
of
our
host
but
he
had
so
high
a
sense
of
his
hospitable
and
responsible
position
as
our
entertainer
and
my
guardian
laughed
so
sincerely
at
and
with
skimpole
as
a
child
who
blew
bubbles
and
broke
them
all
day
long
that
matters
never
went
beyond
this
point
skimpole
who
always
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
having
been
on
delicate
ground
then
betook
himself
to
beginning
some
sketch
in
the
park
which
he
never
finished
or
to
playing
fragments
of
airs
on
the
piano
or
to
singing
scraps
of
songs
or
to
lying
down
on
his
back
under
a
tree
and
looking
at
the
sky
which
he
could
help
thinking
he
said
was
what
he
was
meant
for
it
suited
him
so
exactly
enterprise
and
effort
he
would
say
to
us
on
his
back
are
delightful
to
me
i
believe
i
am
truly
cosmopolitan
i
have
the
deepest
sympathy
with
them
i
lie
in
a
shady
place
like
this
and
think
of
adventurous
spirits
going
to
the
north
pole
or
penetrating
to
the
heart
of
the
torrid
zone
with
admiration
mercenary
creatures
ask
is
the
use
of
a
man
going
to
the
north
pole
what
good
does
it
do
i
ca
say
but
for
anything
i
can
say
he
may
go
for
the
purpose
though
he
do
know
it
of
employing
my
thoughts
as
i
lie
here
take
an
extreme
case
take
the
case
of
the
slaves
on
american
plantations
i
dare
say
they
are
worked
hard
i
dare
say
they
do
altogether
like
it
i
dare
say
theirs
is
an
unpleasant
experience
on
the
whole
but
they
people
the
landscape
for
me
they
give
it
a
poetry
for
me
and
perhaps
that
is
one
of
the
pleasanter
objects
of
their
existence
i
am
very
sensible
of
it
if
it
be
and
i
should
wonder
if
it
were
i
always
wondered
on
these
occasions
whether
he
ever
thought
of
skimpole
and
the
children
and
in
what
point
of
view
they
presented
themselves
to
his
cosmopolitan
mind
so
far
as
i
could
understand
they
rarely
presented
themselves
at
all
the
week
had
gone
round
to
the
saturday
following
that
beating
of
my
heart
in
the
church
and
every
day
had
been
so
bright
and
blue
that
to
ramble
in
the
woods
and
to
see
the
light
striking
down
among
the
transparent
leaves
and
sparkling
in
the
beautiful
interlacings
of
the
shadows
of
the
trees
while
the
birds
poured
out
their
songs
and
the
air
was
drowsy
with
the
hum
of
insects
had
been
most
delightful
we
had
one
favourite
spot
deep
in
moss
and
last
year
leaves
where
there
were
some
felled
trees
from
which
the
bark
was
all
stripped
off
seated
among
these
we
looked
through
a
green
vista
supported
by
thousands
of
natural
columns
the
whitened
stems
of
trees
upon
a
distant
prospect
made
so
radiant
by
its
contrast
with
the
shade
in
which
we
sat
and
made
so
precious
by
the
arched
perspective
through
which
we
saw
it
that
it
was
like
a
glimpse
of
the
better
land
upon
the
saturday
we
sat
here
jarndyce
ada
and
i
until
we
heard
thunder
muttering
in
the
distance
and
felt
the
large
raindrops
rattle
through
the
leaves
the
weather
had
been
all
the
week
extremely
sultry
but
the
storm
broke
so
suddenly
upon
us
at
least
in
that
sheltered
spot
that
before
we
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
the
thunder
and
lightning
were
frequent
and
the
rain
came
plunging
through
the
leaves
as
if
every
drop
were
a
great
leaden
bead
as
it
was
not
a
time
for
standing
among
trees
we
ran
out
of
the
wood
and
up
and
down
the
steps
which
crossed
the
like
two
ladders
placed
back
to
back
and
made
for
a
lodge
which
was
close
at
hand
we
had
often
noticed
the
dark
beauty
of
this
lodge
standing
in
a
deep
twilight
of
trees
and
how
the
ivy
clustered
over
it
and
how
there
was
a
steep
hollow
near
where
we
had
once
seen
the
keeper
dog
dive
down
into
the
fern
as
if
it
were
water
the
lodge
was
so
dark
within
now
the
sky
was
overcast
that
we
only
clearly
saw
the
man
who
came
to
the
door
when
we
took
shelter
there
and
put
two
chairs
for
ada
and
me
the
were
all
thrown
open
and
we
sat
just
within
the
doorway
watching
the
storm
it
was
grand
to
see
how
the
wind
awoke
and
bent
the
trees
and
drove
the
rain
before
it
like
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
to
hear
the
solemn
thunder
and
to
see
the
lightning
and
while
thinking
with
awe
of
the
tremendous
powers
by
which
our
little
lives
are
encompassed
to
consider
how
beneficent
they
are
and
how
upon
the
smallest
flower
and
leaf
there
was
already
a
freshness
poured
from
all
this
seeming
rage
which
seemed
to
make
creation
new
again
is
it
not
dangerous
to
sit
in
so
exposed
a
place
oh
no
esther
dear
said
ada
quietly
ada
said
it
to
me
but
i
had
not
spoken
the
beating
of
my
heart
came
back
again
i
had
never
heard
the
voice
as
i
had
never
seen
the
face
but
it
affected
me
in
the
same
strange
way
again
in
a
moment
there
arose
before
my
mind
innumerable
pictures
of
myself
lady
dedlock
had
taken
shelter
in
the
lodge
before
our
arrival
there
and
had
come
out
of
the
gloom
within
she
stood
behind
my
chair
with
her
hand
upon
it
i
saw
her
with
her
hand
close
to
my
shoulder
when
i
turned
my
head
i
have
frightened
you
she
said
no
it
was
not
fright
why
should
i
be
frightened
i
believe
said
lady
dedlock
to
my
guardian
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
mr
jarndyce
your
remembrance
does
me
more
honour
than
i
had
supposed
it
would
lady
dedlock
he
returned
i
recognized
you
in
church
on
sunday
i
am
sorry
that
any
local
disputes
of
sir
leicester
they
are
not
of
his
seeking
however
i
believe
should
render
it
a
matter
of
some
absurd
difficulty
to
show
you
any
attention
here
i
am
aware
of
the
circumstances
returned
my
guardian
with
a
smile
and
am
sufficiently
obliged
she
had
given
him
her
hand
in
an
indifferent
way
that
seemed
habitual
to
her
and
spoke
in
a
correspondingly
indifferent
manner
though
in
a
very
pleasant
voice
she
was
as
graceful
as
she
was
beautiful
perfectly
and
had
the
air
i
thought
of
being
able
to
attract
and
interest
any
one
if
she
had
thought
it
worth
her
while
the
keeper
had
brought
her
a
chair
on
which
she
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
porch
between
us
is
the
young
gentleman
disposed
of
whom
you
wrote
to
sir
leicester
about
and
whose
wishes
sir
leicester
was
sorry
not
to
have
it
in
his
power
to
advance
in
any
way
she
said
over
her
shoulder
to
my
guardian
i
hope
so
said
he
she
seemed
to
respect
him
and
even
to
wish
to
conciliate
him
there
was
something
very
winning
in
her
haughty
manner
and
it
became
more
familiar
i
was
going
to
say
more
easy
but
that
could
hardly
be
as
she
spoke
to
him
over
her
shoulder
i
presume
this
is
your
other
ward
miss
clare
he
presented
ada
in
form
you
will
lose
the
disinterested
part
of
your
don
quixote
character
said
lady
dedlock
to
jarndyce
over
her
shoulder
again
if
you
only
redress
the
wrongs
of
beauty
like
this
but
present
me
and
she
turned
full
upon
me
to
this
young
lady
too
miss
summerson
really
is
my
ward
said
jarndyce
i
am
responsible
to
no
lord
chancellor
in
her
case
has
miss
summerson
lost
both
her
parents
said
my
lady
yes
she
is
very
fortunate
in
her
guardian
lady
dedlock
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
her
and
said
i
was
indeed
all
at
once
she
turned
from
me
with
a
hasty
air
almost
expressive
of
displeasure
or
dislike
and
spoke
to
him
over
her
shoulder
again
ages
have
passed
since
we
were
in
the
habit
of
meeting
mr
jarndyce
a
long
time
at
least
i
thought
it
was
a
long
time
until
i
saw
you
last
sunday
he
returned
what
even
you
are
a
courtier
or
think
it
necessary
to
become
one
to
me
she
said
with
some
disdain
i
have
achieved
that
reputation
i
suppose
you
have
achieved
so
much
lady
dedlock
said
my
guardian
that
you
pay
some
little
penalty
i
dare
say
but
none
to
me
so
much
she
repeated
slightly
laughing
yes
with
her
air
of
superiority
and
power
and
fascination
and
i
know
not
what
she
seemed
to
regard
ada
and
me
as
little
more
than
children
so
as
she
slightly
laughed
and
afterwards
sat
looking
at
the
rain
she
was
as
and
as
free
to
occupy
herself
with
her
own
thoughts
as
if
she
had
been
alone
i
think
you
knew
my
sister
when
we
were
abroad
together
better
than
you
know
me
she
said
looking
at
him
again
yes
we
happened
to
meet
oftener
he
returned
we
went
our
several
ways
said
lady
dedlock
and
had
little
in
common
even
before
we
agreed
to
differ
it
is
to
be
regretted
i
suppose
but
it
could
not
be
helped
lady
dedlock
again
sat
looking
at
the
rain
the
storm
soon
began
to
pass
upon
its
way
the
shower
greatly
abated
the
lightning
ceased
the
thunder
rolled
among
the
distant
hills
and
the
sun
began
to
glisten
on
the
wet
leaves
and
the
falling
rain
as
we
sat
there
silently
we
saw
a
little
pony
phaeton
coming
towards
us
at
a
merry
pace
the
messenger
is
coming
back
my
lady
said
the
keeper
with
the
carriage
as
it
drove
up
we
saw
that
there
were
two
people
inside
there
alighted
from
it
with
some
cloaks
and
wrappers
first
the
frenchwoman
whom
i
had
seen
in
church
and
secondly
the
pretty
girl
the
frenchwoman
with
a
defiant
confidence
the
pretty
girl
confused
and
hesitating
what
now
said
lady
dedlock
two
i
am
your
maid
my
lady
at
the
present
said
the
frenchwoman
the
message
was
for
the
attendant
i
was
afraid
you
might
mean
me
my
lady
said
the
pretty
girl
i
did
mean
you
child
replied
her
mistress
calmly
put
that
shawl
on
me
she
slightly
stooped
her
shoulders
to
receive
it
and
the
pretty
girl
lightly
dropped
it
in
its
place
the
frenchwoman
stood
unnoticed
looking
on
with
her
lips
very
tightly
set
i
am
sorry
said
lady
dedlock
to
jarndyce
that
we
are
not
likely
to
renew
our
former
acquaintance
you
will
allow
me
to
send
the
carriage
back
for
your
two
wards
it
shall
be
here
directly
but
as
he
would
on
no
account
accept
this
offer
she
took
a
graceful
leave
of
ada
none
of
me
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
proffered
arm
and
got
into
the
carriage
which
was
a
little
low
park
carriage
with
a
hood
come
in
child
she
said
to
the
pretty
girl
i
shall
want
you
go
on
the
carriage
rolled
away
and
the
frenchwoman
with
the
wrappers
she
had
brought
hanging
over
her
arm
remained
standing
where
she
had
alighted
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
pride
can
so
little
bear
with
as
pride
itself
and
that
she
was
punished
for
her
imperious
manner
her
retaliation
was
the
most
singular
i
could
have
imagined
she
remained
perfectly
still
until
the
carriage
had
turned
into
the
drive
and
then
without
the
least
discomposure
of
countenance
slipped
off
her
shoes
left
them
on
the
ground
and
walked
deliberately
in
the
same
direction
through
the
wettest
of
the
wet
grass
is
that
young
woman
mad
said
my
guardian
oh
no
sir
said
the
keeper
who
with
his
wife
was
looking
after
her
hortense
is
not
one
of
that
sort
she
has
as
good
a
as
the
best
but
she
mortal
high
and
passionate
powerful
high
and
passionate
and
what
with
having
notice
to
leave
and
having
others
put
above
her
she
do
take
kindly
to
it
but
why
should
she
walk
shoeless
through
all
that
water
said
my
guardian
why
indeed
sir
unless
it
is
to
cool
her
down
said
the
man
or
unless
she
fancies
it
blood
said
the
woman
she
as
soon
walk
through
that
as
anything
else
i
think
when
her
own
up
we
passed
not
far
from
the
house
a
few
minutes
afterwards
peaceful
as
it
had
looked
when
we
first
saw
it
it
looked
even
more
so
now
with
a
diamond
spray
glittering
all
about
it
a
light
wind
blowing
the
birds
no
longer
hushed
but
singing
strongly
everything
refreshed
by
the
late
rain
and
the
little
carriage
shining
at
the
doorway
like
a
fairy
carriage
made
of
silver
still
very
steadfastly
and
quietly
walking
towards
it
a
peaceful
figure
too
in
the
landscape
went
mademoiselle
hortense
shoeless
through

comes
out
in

an
innocent

sings
comic
ditties

as
the

says
not
to
wound
the
feelings
of
the
most
fastidious
mind
over
all
the
legal
neighbourhood
there
hangs
like
some
great
veil
of
rust
or
gigantic
cobweb
the
idleness
and
pensiveness
of
the
long
vacation
snagsby
of
cook
court
cursitor
street
is
sensible
of
the
influence
not
only
in
his
mind
as
a
sympathetic
and
contemplative
man
but
also
in
his
business
as
a
aforesaid
he
has
more
leisure
for
musing
in
staple
inn
and
in
the
rolls
yard
during
the
long
vacation
than
at
other
seasons
and
he
says
to
the
two
what
a
thing
it
is
in
such
hot
weather
to
think
that
you
live
in
an
island
with
the
sea
and
right
round
you
guster
is
busy
in
the
little
on
this
present
afternoon
in
the
long
vacation
when
and
snagsby
have
it
in
contemplation
to
receive
company
the
expected
guests
are
rather
select
than
numerous
being
and
chadband
and
no
more
from
chadband
being
much
given
to
describe
himself
both
verbally
and
in
writing
as
a
vessel
he
is
occasionally
mistaken
by
strangers
for
a
gentleman
connected
with
navigation
but
he
is
as
he
expresses
it
in
the
ministry
chadband
is
attached
to
no
particular
denomination
and
is
considered
by
his
persecutors
to
have
nothing
so
very
remarkable
to
say
on
the
greatest
of
subjects
as
to
render
his
volunteering
on
his
own
account
at
all
incumbent
on
his
conscience
but
he
has
his
followers
and
snagsby
is
of
the
number
snagsby
has
but
recently
taken
a
passage
upward
by
the
vessel
chadband
and
her
attention
was
attracted
to
that
bark
a
when
she
was
something
flushed
by
the
hot
weather
my
little
woman
says
snagsby
to
the
sparrows
in

to
have
her
religion
rather
sharp
you
see
so
guster
much
impressed
by
regarding
herself
for
the
time
as
the
handmaid
of
chadband
whom
she
knows
to
be
endowed
with
the
gift
of
holding
forth
for
four
hours
at
a
stretch
prepares
the
little
for
tea
all
the
furniture
is
shaken
and
dusted
the
portraits
of
and
snagsby
are
touched
up
with
a
wet
cloth
the
best
is
set
forth
and
there
is
excellent
provision
made
of
dainty
new
bread
crusty
twists
cool
fresh
butter
thin
slices
of
ham
tongue
and
german
sausage
and
delicate
little
rows
of
anchovies
nestling
in
parsley
not
to
mention
eggs
to
be
brought
up
warm
in
a
napkin
and
hot
buttered
toast
for
chadband
is
rather
a
consuming
vessel
the
persecutors
say
a
gorging
vessel
and
can
wield
such
weapons
of
the
flesh
as
a
knife
and
fork
remarkably
well
snagsby
in
his
best
coat
looking
at
all
the
preparations
when
they
are
completed
and
coughing
his
cough
of
deference
behind
his
hand
says
to
snagsby
at
what
time
did
you
expect
and
chadband
my
love
at
six
says
snagsby
snagsby
observes
in
a
mild
and
casual
way
that
it
gone
that
perhaps
you
like
to
begin
without
them
is
reproachful
remark
snagsby
does
look
as
if
he
would
like
it
very
much
but
he
says
with
his
cough
of
mildness
no
my
dear
no
i
merely
named
the
time
what
time
says
snagsby
to
eternity
very
true
my
dear
says
snagsby
only
when
a
person
lays
in
victuals
for
tea
a
person
does
it
with
a
view
perhaps
more
to
time
and
when
a
time
is
named
for
having
tea
it
better
to
come
up
to
it
to
come
up
to
it
snagsby
repeats
with
severity
up
to
it
as
if
chadband
was
a
fighter
not
at
all
my
dear
says
snagsby
here
guster
who
had
been
looking
out
of
the
bedroom
window
comes
rustling
and
scratching
down
the
little
staircase
like
a
popular
ghost
and
falling
flushed
into
the
announces
that
and
chadband
have
appeared
in
the
court
the
bell
at
the
inner
door
in
the
passage
immediately
thereafter
tinkling
she
is
admonished
by
snagsby
on
pain
of
instant
reconsignment
to
her
patron
saint
not
to
omit
the
ceremony
of
announcement
much
discomposed
in
her
nerves
which
were
previously
in
the
best
order
by
this
threat
she
so
fearfully
mutilates
that
point
of
state
as
to
announce
and
cheeseming
least
which
imeantersay
whatsername
and
retires
from
the
presence
chadband
is
a
large
yellow
man
with
a
fat
smile
and
a
general
appearance
of
having
a
good
deal
of
train
oil
in
his
system
chadband
is
a
stern
silent
woman
chadband
moves
softly
and
cumbrously
not
unlike
a
bear
who
has
been
taught
to
walk
upright
he
is
very
much
embarrassed
about
the
arms
as
if
they
were
inconvenient
to
him
and
he
wanted
to
grovel
is
very
much
in
a
perspiration
about
the
head
and
never
speaks
without
first
putting
up
his
great
hand
as
delivering
a
token
to
his
hearers
that
he
is
going
to
edify
them
my
friends
says
chadband
peace
be
on
this
house
on
the
master
thereof
on
the
mistress
thereof
on
the
young
maidens
and
on
the
young
men
my
friends
why
do
i
wish
for
peace
what
is
peace
is
it
war
no
is
it
strife
no
is
it
lovely
and
gentle
and
beautiful
and
pleasant
and
serene
and
joyful
oh
yes
therefore
my
friends
i
wish
for
peace
upon
you
and
upon
yours
in
consequence
of
snagsby
looking
deeply
edified
snagsby
thinks
it
expedient
on
the
whole
to
say
amen
which
is
well
received
now
my
friends
proceeds
chadband
since
i
am
upon
this
theme
guster
presents
herself
snagsby
in
a
spectral
bass
voice
and
without
removing
her
eyes
from
chadband
says
with
dreadful
distinctness
go
away
now
my
friends
says
chadband
since
i
am
upon
this
theme
and
in
my
lowly
path
improving
it
guster
is
heard
unaccountably
to
murmur
one
thousing
seven
hundred
and
the
spectral
voice
repeats
more
solemnly
go
away
now
my
friends
says
chadband
we
will
inquire
in
a
spirit
of
love
still
guster
reiterates
one
thousing
seven
hundred
and
chadband
pausing
with
the
resignation
of
a
man
accustomed
to
be
persecuted
and
languidly
folding
up
his
chin
into
his
fat
smile
says
let
us
hear
the
maiden
speak
maiden
one
thousing
seven
hundred
and
if
you
please
sir
which
he
wish
to
know
what
the
shilling
ware
for
says
guster
breathless
for
returns
chadband
for
his
fare
guster
replied
that
he
insistes
on
one
and
eightpence
or
on
summonsizzing
the
party
snagsby
and
chadband
are
proceeding
to
grow
shrill
in
indignation
when
chadband
quiets
the
tumult
by
lifting
up
his
hand
my
friends
says
he
i
remember
a
duty
unfulfilled
yesterday
it
is
right
that
i
should
be
chastened
in
some
penalty
i
ought
not
to
murmur
rachael
pay
the
eightpence
while
snagsby
drawing
her
breath
looks
hard
at
snagsby
as
who
should
say
you
hear
this
apostle
and
while
chadband
glows
with
humility
and
train
oil
chadband
pays
the
money
it
is
chadband
habit
it
is
the
head
and
front
of
his
pretensions
indeed
to
keep
this
sort
of
debtor
and
creditor
account
in
the
smallest
items
and
to
post
it
publicly
on
the
most
trivial
occasions
my
friends
says
chadband
eightpence
is
not
much
it
might
justly
have
been
one
and
fourpence
it
might
justly
have
been
half
a
crown
o
let
us
be
joyful
joyful
o
let
us
be
joyful
with
which
remark
which
appears
from
its
sound
to
be
an
extract
in
verse
chadband
stalks
to
the
table
and
before
taking
a
chair
lifts
up
his
admonitory
hand
my
friends
says
he
what
is
this
which
we
now
behold
as
being
spread
before
us
refreshment
do
we
need
refreshment
then
my
friends
we
do
and
why
do
we
need
refreshment
my
friends
because
we
are
but
mortal
because
we
are
but
sinful
because
we
are
but
of
the
earth
because
we
are
not
of
the
air
can
we
fly
my
friends
we
can
not
why
can
we
not
fly
my
friends
snagsby
presuming
on
the
success
of
his
last
point
ventures
to
observe
in
a
cheerful
and
rather
knowing
tone
no
wings
but
is
immediately
frowned
down
by
snagsby
i
say
my
friends
pursues
chadband
utterly
rejecting
and
obliterating
snagsby
suggestion
why
can
we
not
fly
is
it
because
we
are
calculated
to
walk
it
is
could
we
walk
my
friends
without
strength
we
could
not
what
should
we
do
without
strength
my
friends
our
legs
would
refuse
to
bear
us
our
knees
would
double
up
our
ankles
would
turn
over
and
we
should
come
to
the
ground
then
from
whence
my
friends
in
a
human
point
of
view
do
we
derive
the
strength
that
is
necessary
to
our
limbs
is
it
says
chadband
glancing
over
the
table
from
bread
in
various
forms
from
butter
which
is
churned
from
the
milk
which
is
yielded
unto
us
by
the
cow
from
the
eggs
which
are
laid
by
the
fowl
from
ham
from
tongue
from
sausage
and
from
such
like
it
is
then
let
us
partake
of
the
good
things
which
are
set
before
us
the
persecutors
denied
that
there
was
any
particular
gift
in
chadband
piling
verbose
flights
of
stairs
one
upon
another
after
this
fashion
but
this
can
only
be
received
as
a
proof
of
their
determination
to
persecute
since
it
must
be
within
experience
that
the
chadband
style
of
oratory
is
widely
received
and
much
admired
chadband
however
having
concluded
for
the
present
sits
down
at
snagsby
table
and
lays
about
him
prodigiously
the
conversion
of
nutriment
of
any
sort
into
oil
of
the
quality
already
mentioned
appears
to
be
a
process
so
inseparable
from
the
constitution
of
this
exemplary
vessel
that
in
beginning
to
eat
and
drink
he
may
be
described
as
always
becoming
a
kind
of
considerable
oil
mills
or
other
large
factory
for
the
production
of
that
article
on
a
wholesale
scale
on
the
present
evening
of
the
long
vacation
in
cook
court
cursitor
street
he
does
such
a
powerful
stroke
of
business
that
the
warehouse
appears
to
be
quite
full
when
the
works
cease
at
this
period
of
the
entertainment
guster
who
has
never
recovered
her
first
failure
but
has
neglected
no
possible
or
impossible
means
of
bringing
the
establishment
and
herself
into
contempt
among
which
may
be
briefly
enumerated
her
unexpectedly
performing
clashing
military
music
on
chadband
head
with
plates
and
afterwards
crowning
that
gentleman
with
muffins
at
which
period
of
the
entertainment
guster
whispers
snagsby
that
he
is
wanted
and
being
wanted
in
the
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
in
the
shop
says
snagsby
rising
perhaps
this
good
company
will
excuse
me
for
half
a
minute
snagsby
descends
and
finds
the
two
intently
contemplating
a
police
constable
who
holds
a
ragged
boy
by
the
arm
why
bless
my
heart
says
snagsby
what
the
matter
this
boy
says
the
constable
although
he
repeatedly
told
to
wo
move
on
i
always
on
sar
cries
the
boy
wiping
away
his
grimy
tears
with
his
arm
i
always
been
and
on
ever
since
i
was
born
where
can
i
possibly
move
to
sir
more
nor
i
do
move
he
wo
move
on
says
the
constable
calmly
with
a
slight
professional
hitch
of
his
neck
involving
its
better
settlement
in
his
stiff
stock
although
he
has
been
repeatedly
cautioned
and
therefore
i
am
obliged
to
take
him
into
custody
he
as
obstinate
a
young
gonoph
as
i
know
he
wo
move
on
oh
my
eye
where
can
i
move
to
cries
the
boy
clutching
quite
desperately
at
his
hair
and
beating
his
bare
feet
upon
the
floor
of
snagsby
passage
do
you
come
none
of
that
or
i
shall
make
blessed
short
work
of
you
says
the
constable
giving
him
a
passionless
shake
my
instructions
are
that
you
are
to
move
on
i
have
told
you
so
five
hundred
times
but
where
cries
the
boy
well
really
constable
you
know
says
snagsby
wistfully
and
coughing
behind
his
hand
his
cough
of
great
perplexity
and
doubt
really
that
does
seem
a
question
where
you
know
my
instructions
do
go
to
that
replies
the
constable
my
instructions
are
that
this
boy
is
to
move
on
do
you
hear
jo
it
is
nothing
to
you
or
to
any
one
else
that
the
great
lights
of
the
parliamentary
sky
have
failed
for
some
few
years
in
this
business
to
set
you
the
example
of
moving
on
the
one
grand
recipe
remains
for
you
the
profound
philosophical
prescription
the
and
the
of
your
strange
existence
upon
earth
move
on
you
are
by
no
means
to
move
off
jo
for
the
great
lights
ca
at
all
agree
about
that
move
on
snagsby
says
nothing
to
this
effect
says
nothing
at
all
indeed
but
coughs
his
forlornest
cough
expressive
of
no
thoroughfare
in
any
direction
by
this
time
and
chadband
and
snagsby
hearing
the
altercation
have
appeared
upon
the
stairs
guster
having
never
left
the
end
of
the
passage
the
whole
household
are
assembled
the
simple
question
is
sir
says
the
constable
whether
you
know
this
boy
he
says
you
do
snagsby
from
her
elevation
instantly
cries
out
no
he
do
my
woman
says
snagsby
looking
up
the
staircase
my
love
permit
me
pray
have
a
moment
patience
my
dear
i
do
know
something
of
this
lad
and
in
what
i
know
of
him
i
ca
say
that
there
any
harm
perhaps
on
the
contrary
constable
to
whom
the
relates
his
joful
and
woeful
experience
suppressing
the
fact
well
says
the
constable
so
far
it
seems
he
had
grounds
for
what
he
said
when
i
took
him
into
custody
up
in
holborn
he
said
you
knew
him
upon
that
a
young
man
who
was
in
the
crowd
said
he
was
acquainted
with
you
and
you
were
a
respectable
housekeeper
and
if
i
call
and
make
the
inquiry
he
appear
the
young
man
do
seem
inclined
to
keep
his
word
but
oh
here
is
the
young
man
enter
guppy
who
nods
to
snagsby
and
touches
his
hat
with
the
chivalry
of
clerkship
to
the
ladies
on
the
stairs
i
was
strolling
away
from
the
office
just
now
when
i
found
this
row
going
on
says
guppy
to
the

your
name
was
mentioned

thought
it
was
right

thing
should
be
looked
into
it
was
very
of
you
sir
says
snagsby
and
i
am
obliged
to
you
and
snagsby
again
relates
his
experience
again
suppressing
the
fact
now
i
know
where
you
live
says
the
constable
then
to
jo
you
live
down
in
that
a
nice
innocent
place
to
live
in
ai

i
ca

the
constable
producing
them
to
the
company
in
only
putting
my
hand
upon
him
they

thieved
ninepence
and
the
landlord
he
stood
drains
round
with
a
lot
more
on
it
you
do
expect
anybody
to
believe
this
about
the
lady
and
the
sovereign
do
you
says
the
constable
eyeing
him
aside
with
ineffable
disdain
i
do
know
as
i
do
sir
replies
jo
i
do
expect
nothink
at
all
sir
much
but
that
the
true
on
it
you
see
what
he
is
the
constable
observes
to
the
audience
well
snagsby
if
i
do
lock
him
up
this
time
will
you
engage
for
his
moving
on
no
cries
snagsby
from
the
stairs
my
little
woman
pleads
her
husband
constable
i
have
no
doubt

on

you
really
must
do
it
says
snagsby
i
everyways
agreeable
sir
says
the
hapless
jo
do
it
then
observes
the
constable
you
know
what
you
have
got
to
do
do
it
and
recollect
you
wo
get
off
so
easy
next
time
catch
hold
of
your
money
now
the
sooner
you
five
mile
off
the
better
for
all
parties
with
this
farewell
hint
and
pointing
generally
to
the
setting
sun
as
a
likely
place
to
move
on
to
the
constable
bids
his
auditors
good
afternoon
and
makes
the
echoes
of
cook
court
perform
slow
music
for
him
as
he
walks
away
on
the
shady
side
carrying
his
hat
in
his
hand
for
a
little
ventilation
now
jo
improbable
story
concerning
the
lady
and
the
sovereign
has
awakened
more
or
less
the
curiosity
of
all
the
company
guppy
who
has
an
inquiring
mind
in
matters
of
evidence
and
who
has
been
suffering
severely
from
the
lassitude

that
he
enters
on
a
regular
of
the
witness

is
found
so
interesting
by
the
ladies
that
snagsby
politely
invites
him
to
step
upstairs
and
drink
a
cup
of
tea
if
he
will
excuse
the
disarranged
state

yielding
his
assent
to
this
proposal

is
requested
to
follow
into
the
doorway
where
guppy
takes
him
in
hand
as
a
witness
patting
him
into
this
shape
that
shape
and
the
other
shape
like
a
butterman
dealing
with
so
much
butter
and
worrying
him
according
to
the
best
models
nor
is
the
examination
unlike
many
such
model
displays
both
in
respect
of
its
eliciting
nothing
and
of
its
being
lengthy
for
guppy
is
sensible
of
his
talent
and
snagsby
feels
not
only
that
it
gratifies
her
inquisitive
disposition
but
that
it
lifts
her

up

keen
encounter
the

chadband
being

oil
trade
gets
aground
and
waits
to
be
floated
off
well
says
guppy
either
this
boy
sticks
to
it
like
or
there
is
something
out
of
the
common
here
that
beats
anything
that
ever
came
into
my
way
at
kenge
and
carboy
chadband
whispers
snagsby
who
exclaims
you
do
say
so
for
years
replied
chadband
has
known
kenge
and
carboy
office
for
years
snagsby
triumphantly
explains
to
guppy
chadband
this
wife
reverend
mr
chadband
oh
indeed
says
guppy
before
i
married
my
present
husband
says
chadband
was
you
a
party
in
anything
says
guppy
transferring
his
no
not
a
party
in
anything
says
guppy
chadband
shakes
her
head
perhaps
you
were
acquainted
with
somebody
who
was
a
party
in
something
says
guppy
who
likes
nothing
better
than
to
model
his
conversation
on
forensic
principles
not
exactly
that
either
replies
chadband
humouring
the
joke
with
a
smile
not
exactly
that
either
repeats
guppy
very
good
pray
was
it
a
lady
of
your
acquaintance
who
had
some
transactions
we
will
not
at
present
say
what
transactions
with
kenge
and
carboy
office
or
was
it
a
gentleman
of
your
acquaintance
take
time
we
shall
come
to
it
presently
man
or
woman
neither
says
chadband
as
before
oh
a
child
says
guppy
throwing
on
the
admiring
snagsby
the
regular
acute
professional
eye
which
is
thrown
on
british
jurymen
now
perhaps
you
have
the
kindness
to
tell
us
what
child
you
have
got
it
at
last
sir
says
chadband
with
another
smile
well
sir
it
was
before
your
time
most
likely
judging
from
your
appearance
i
was
left
in
charge
of
a
child
named
esther
summerson
who
was
put
out
in
life
by
kenge
and
carboy
miss
summerson
cries
guppy
excited
i
call
her
esther
summerson
says
chadband
with
austerity
there
was
no
of
the
girl
in
my
time
it
was
esther
do
this
esther
do
that
and
she
was
made
to
do
it
my
dear
returns
guppy
moving
across
the
small
apartment
the
humble
individual
who
now
addresses
you
received
that
young
lady
in
london
when
she
first
came
here
from
the
establishment
to
which
you
have
alluded
allow
me
to
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
by
the
hand
chadband
at
last
seeing
his
opportunity
makes
his
accustomed
signal
and
rises
with
a
smoking
head
which
he
dabs
with
his
snagsby
whispers
hush
my
friends
says
chadband
we
have
partaken
in
moderation
which
was
certainly
not
the
case
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
of
the
comforts
which
have
been
provided
for
us
may
this
house
live
upon
the
fatness
of
the
land
may
corn
and
wine
be
plentiful
therein
may
it
grow
may
it
thrive
may
it
prosper
may
it
advance
may
it
proceed
may
it
press
forward
but
my
friends
have
we
partaken
of
anything
else
we
have
my
friends
of
what
else
have
we
partaken
of
spiritual
profit
yes
from
whence
have
we
derived
that
spiritual
profit
my
young
friend
stand
forth
jo
thus
apostrophized
gives
a
slouch
backward
and
another
slouch
forward
and
another
slouch
to
each
side
and
confronts
the
eloquent
chadband
with
evident
doubts
of
his
intentions
my
young
friend
says
chadband
you
are
to
us
a
pearl
you
are
to
us
a
diamond
you
are
to
us
a
gem
you
are
to
us
a
jewel
and
why
my
young
friend
i
do
know
replies
jo
i
do
know
nothink
my
young
friend
says
chadband
it
is
because
you
know
nothing
that
you
are
to
us
a
gem
and
jewel
for
what
are
you
my
young
friend
are
you
a
beast
of
the
field
no
a
bird
of
the
air
no
a
fish
of
the
sea
or
river
no
you
are
a
human
boy
my
young
friend
a
human
boy
o
glorious
to
be
a
human
boy
and
why
glorious
my
young
friend
because
you
are
capable
of
receiving
the
lessons
of
wisdom
because
you
are
capable
of
profiting
by
this
discourse
which
i
now
deliver
for
your
good
because
you
are
not
a
stick
or
a
staff
or
a
stock
or
a
stone
or
a
post
or
a
pillar
o
running
stream
of
sparkling
joy
to
be
a
soaring
human
boy
and
do
you
cool
yourself
in
that
stream
now
my
young
friend
no
why
do
you
not
cool
yourself
in
that
stream
now
because
you
are
in
a
state
of
darkness
because
you
are
in
a
state
of
obscurity
because
you
are
in
a
state
of
sinfulness
because
you
are
in
a
state
of
bondage
my
young
friend
what
is
bondage
let
us
in
a
spirit
of
love
inquire
at
this
threatening
stage
of
the
discourse
jo
who
seems
to
have
been
gradually
going
out
of
his
mind
smears
his
right
arm
over
his
face
and
gives
a
terrible
yawn
snagsby
indignantly
expresses
her
belief
that
he
is
a
limb
of
the
my
friends
says
chadband
with
his
persecuted
chin
folding
itself
into
its
fat
smile
again
as
he
looks
round
it
is
right
that
i
should
be
humbled
it
is
right
that
i
should
be
tried
it
is
right
that
i
should
be
mortified
it
is
right
that
i
should
be
corrected
i
stumbled
on
sabbath
last
when
i
thought
with
pride
of
my
three
hours
improving
the
account
is
now
favourably
balanced
my
creditor
has
accepted
a
composition
o
let
us
be
joyful
joyful
o
let
us
be

great
sensation
on
the
part
of
snagsby
my
friends
says
chadband
looking
round
him
in
conclusion
i
will
not
proceed
with
my
young
friend
now
will
you
come
my
young
friend
and
inquire
of
this
good
lady
where
i
am
to
be
found
to
deliver
a
discourse
unto
you
and
will
you
come
like
the
thirsty
swallow
upon
the
next
day
and
upon
the
day
after
that
and
upon
the
day
after
that
and
upon
many
pleasant
days
to
hear
discourses
this
with
a
lightness
jo
whose
immediate
object
seems
to
be
to
get
away
on
any
terms
gives
a
shuffling
nod
guppy
then
throws
him
a
penny
and
snagsby
calls
to
guster
to
see
him
safely
out
of
the
house
but
before
he
goes
downstairs
snagsby
loads
him
with
some
broken
meats
from
the
table
which
he
carries
away
hugging
in
his
arms
so
chadband
of
whom
the
persecutors
say
that
it
is
no
wonder
he
should
go
on
for
any
length
of
time
uttering
such
abominable
nonsense
but
that
the
wonder
rather
is
that
he
should
ever
leave
off
having
once
the
audacity
to
begin
retires
into
private
life
until
he
invests
a
little
capital
of
supper
in
the
jo
moves
on
through
the
long
vacation
down
to
blackfriars
bridge
where
he
finds
a
baking
stony
corner
wherein
to
settle
to
his
repast
and
there
he
sits
munching
and
gnawing
and
looking
up
at
the
great
cross
on
the
summit
of
paul
cathedral
glittering
above
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
the
boy
face
one
might
suppose
that
sacred
emblem
to
be
in
his
eyes
the
crowning
confusion
of
the
great
confused
city
so
golden
so
high
up
so
far
out
of
his
reach
there
he
sits
the
sun
going
down
the
river
running
fast
the
crowd
flowing
by
him
in
two
streams
everything
moving
on
to
some
purpose
and
to
one
end

up
and
told
to

a
new
lodger
the
long
vacation
saunters
on
towards
like
an
idle
river
very
leisurely
strolling
down
a
flat
country
to
the
sea
guppy
saunters
along
with
it
congenially
he
has
blunted
the
blade
of
his
penknife
and
broken
the
point
off
by
sticking
that
instrument
into
his
desk
in
every
direction
not
that
he
bears
the
desk
any
ill
will
but
he
must
do
something
and
it
must
be
something
of
an
unexciting
nature
which
will
lay
neither
his
physical
nor
his
intellectual
energies
under
too
heavy
contribution
he
finds
that
nothing
agrees
with
him
so
well
as
to
make
little
gyrations
on
one
leg
of
his
stool
and
stab
his
desk
and
gape
kenge
and
carboy
are
out
of
town
and
the
articled
clerk
has
taken
out
a
shooting
license
and
gone
down
to
his
father
and
two
are
away
on
leave
guppy
and
richard
carstone
divide
the
dignity
of
the
office
but
carstone
is
for
the
time
being
established
in
kenge
room
whereat
guppy
chafes
so
exceedingly
that
he
with
biting
sarcasm
informs
his
mother
in
the
confidential
moments
when
he
sups
with
her
off
a
lobster
and
lettuce
in
the
old
street
road
that
he
is
afraid
the
office
is
hardly
good
enough
for
swells
and
that
if
he
had
known
there
was
a
swell
coming
he
would
have
got
it
painted
guppy
suspects
everybody
who
enters
on
the
occupation
of
a
stool
in
kenge
and
carboy
office
of
entertaining
as
a
matter
of
course
sinister
designs
upon
him
he
is
clear
that
every
such
person
wants
to
depose
him
if
he
be
ever
asked
how
why
when
or
wherefore
he
shuts
up
one
eye
and
shakes
his
head
on
the
strength
of
these
profound
views
he
in
the
most
ingenious
manner
takes
infinite
pains
to
counterplot
when
there
is
no
plot
and
plays
the
deepest
games
of
chess
without
any
adversary
it
is
a
source
of
much
gratification
to
guppy
therefore
to
find
the
constantly
poring
over
the
papers
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
for
he
well
knows
that
nothing
but
confusion
and
failure
can
come
of
that
his
satisfaction
communicates
itself
to
a
third
saunterer
through
the
long
vacation
in
kenge
and

in

he
is
now
something
under
fifteen
and
an
old
limb
of
the

he
is
facetiously
understood
to
entertain
a
passion
for
a
lady
at
a
in
the
neighbourhood
of

and
for
her
sake
to
have
broken
off
a
contract
with
another
lady
to
whom
he
had
been
engaged
some
years
he
is
a
article
of
small
stature
and
weazen
features
but
may
be
perceived
from
a
considerable
distance
by
means
of
his
very
tall
hat
to
become

the
object

been
lolling
out
of

all
the

after
trying

in

finding

propounds
for

consideration
the
paradox
that
the

the
thirstier
you
are

reclines
his
head
upon
the
in
a
state
of
hopeless
languor
while
thus
looking
out
into
the
shade
of
old
square
lincoln
inn
surveying
the
intolerable
bricks
and
mortar
guppy
becomes
conscious
of
a
manly
whisker
emerging
from
the
cloistered
walk
below
and
turning
itself
up
in
the
direction
of
his
face
at
the
same
time
a
low
whistle
is
wafted
through
the
inn
and
a
suppressed
voice
cries
hip
why
you
do
mean
it
says
guppy
aroused
small
jobling
small
head
looks
out
of
window
too
and
nods
to
jobling
where
have
you
sprung
up
from
inquires
guppy
from
the
down
by
deptford
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
i
must
enlist
i
say
i
wish
you
lend
me
half
a
crown
upon
my
soul
i
hungry
jobling
looks
hungry
and
also
has
the
appearance
of
having
run
to
seed
in
the
down
by
deptford
i
say
just
throw
out
half
a
crown
if
you
have
got
one
to
spare
i
want
to
get
some
dinner
will
you
come
and
dine
with
me
says
guppy
throwing
out
the
coin
which
jobling
catches
neatly
how
long
should
i
have
to
hold
out
says
jobling
not
half
an
hour
i
am
only
waiting
here
till
the
enemy
goes
returns
guppy
butting
inward
with
his
head
what
enemy
a
new
one
going
to
be
articled
will
you
wait
can
you
give
a
fellow
anything
to
read
in
the
meantime
says
jobling
smallweed
suggests
the
law
list
but
jobling
declares
with
much
earnestness
that
he
ca
stand
it
you
shall
have
the
paper
says
guppy
he
shall
bring
it
down
but
you
had
better
not
be
seen
about
here
sit
on
our
staircase
and
read
it
a
quiet
place
jobling
nods
intelligence
and
acquiescence
the
sagacious
smallweed
supplies
him
with
the
newspaper
and
occasionally
drops
his
eye
upon
him
from
the
landing
as
a
precaution
against
his
becoming
disgusted
with
waiting
and
making
an
untimely
departure
at
last
the
enemy
retreats
and
then
smallweed
fetches
jobling
up
well
and
how
are
you
says
guppy
shaking
hands
with
him
so
so
how
are
you
guppy
replying
that
he
is
not
much
to
boast
of
jobling
ventures
on
the
question
how
is
she
this
guppy
resents
as
a
liberty
retorting
jobling
there
are
chords
in
the
human
mind
jobling
begs
pardon
any
subject
but
that
says
guppy
with
a
gloomy
enjoyment
of
his
injury
for
there
are
chords
jobling
jobling
begs
pardon
again
during
this
short
colloquy
the
active
smallweed
who
is
of
the
dinner
party
has
written
in
legal
characters
on
a
slip
of
paper
return
immediately
this
notification
to
all
whom
it
may
concern
he
inserts
in
the
and
then
putting
on
the
tall
hat
at
the
angle
of
inclination
at
which
guppy
wears
his
informs
his
patron
that
they
may
now
make
themselves
scarce
accordingly
they
betake
themselves
to
a
neighbouring
of
the
class
known
among
its
frequenters
by
the
denomination
where
the
waitress
a
bouncing
young
female
of
forty
is
supposed
to
have
made
some
impression
on
the
susceptible
smallweed
of
whom
it
may
be
remarked
that
he
is
a
weird
changeling
to
whom
years
are
nothing
he
stands
precociously
possessed
of
centuries
of
owlish
wisdom
if
he
ever
lay
in
a
cradle
it
seems
as
if
he
must
have
lain
there
in
a
he
has
an
old
old
eye
has
smallweed
and
he
drinks
and
smokes
in
a
monkeyish
way
and
his
neck
is
stiff
in
his
collar
and
he
is
never
to
be
taken
in
and
he
knows
all
about
it
whatever
it
is
in
short
in
his
bringing
up
he
has
been
so
nursed
by
law
and
equity
that
he
has
become
a
kind
of
fossil
imp
to
account
for
whose
terrestrial
existence
it
is
reported
at
the
public
offices
that
his
father
was
john
doe
and
his
mother
the
only
female
member
of
the
roe
family
also
that
his
first
were
made
from
a
blue
bag
into
the
unaffected
by
the
seductive
show
in
the
window
of
artificially
whitened
cauliflowers
and
poultry
verdant
baskets
of
peas
coolly
blooming
cucumbers
and
joints
ready
for
the
spit
smallweed
leads
the
way
they
know
him
there
and
defer
to
him
he
has
his
favourite
box
he
bespeaks
all
the
papers
he
is
down
upon
bald
patriarchs
who
keep
them
more
than
ten
minutes
afterwards
it
is
of
no
use
trying
him
with
anything
less
than
a
bread
or
proposing
to
him
any
joint
in
cut
unless
it
is
in
the
very
best
cut
in
the
matter
of
gravy
he
is
adamant
conscious
of
his
elfin
power
and
submitting
to
his
dread
experience
guppy
consults
him
in
the
choice
of
that
day
banquet
turning
an
appealing
look
towards
him
as
the
waitress
repeats
the
catalogue
of
viands
and
saying
what
do
you
take
chick
chick
out
of
the
profundity
of
his
artfulness
preferring
veal
and
ham
and
french
beans
and
do
you
forget
the
stuffing
polly
with
an
unearthly
cock
of
his
venerable
eye
guppy
and
jobling
give
the
like
order
three
pint
pots
of
are
superadded
quickly
the
waitress
returns
bearing
what
is
apparently
a
model
of
the
tower
of
babel
but
what
is
really
a
pile
of
plates
and
flat
tin
smallweed
approving
of
what
is
set
before
him
conveys
intelligent
benignity
into
his
ancient
eye
and
winks
upon
her
then
amid
a
constant
coming
in
and
going
out
and
running
about
and
a
clatter
of
crockery
and
a
rumbling
up
and
down
of
the
machine
which
brings
the
nice
cuts
from
the
kitchen
and
a
shrill
crying
for
more
nice
cuts
down
the
and
a
shrill
reckoning
of
the
cost
of
nice
cuts
that
have
been
disposed
of
and
a
general
flush
and
steam
of
hot
joints
cut
and
uncut
and
a
considerably
heated
atmosphere
in
which
the
soiled
knives
and
tablecloths
seem
to
break
out
spontaneously
into
eruptions
of
grease
and
blotches
of
beer
the
legal
triumvirate
appease
their
appetites
jobling
is
buttoned
up
closer
than
mere
adornment
might
require
his
hat
presents
at
the
rims
a
peculiar
appearance
of
a
glistening
nature
as
if
it
had
been
a
favourite
the
same
phenomenon
is
visible
on
some
parts
of
his
coat
and
particularly
at
the
seams
he
has
the
faded
appearance
of
a
gentleman
in
embarrassed
circumstances
even
his
light
whiskers
droop
with
something
of
a
shabby
air
his
appetite
is
so
vigorous
that
it
suggests
spare
living
for
some
little
time
back
he
makes
such
a
speedy
end
of
his
plate
of
veal
and
ham
bringing
it
to
a
close
while
his
companions
are
yet
midway
in
theirs
that
guppy
proposes
another
thank
you
guppy
says
jobling
i
really
do
know
but
what
i
will
take
another
another
being
brought
he
falls
to
with
great
goodwill
guppy
takes
silent
notice
of
him
at
intervals
until
he
is
half
way
through
this
second
plate
and
stops
to
take
an
enjoying
pull
at
his
pint
pot
of
also
renewed
and
stretches
out
his
legs
and
rubs
his
hands
beholding
him
in
which
glow
of
contentment
guppy
says
you
are
a
man
again
tony
well
not
quite
yet
says
jobling
say
just
born
will
you
take
any
other
vegetables
grass
peas
summer
cabbage
thank
you
guppy
says
jobling
i
really
do
know
but
what
i
will
take
summer
cabbage
order
given
with
the
sarcastic
addition
from
smallweed
of
without
slugs
polly
and
cabbage
produced
i
am
growing
up
guppy
says
jobling
plying
his
knife
and
fork
with
a
relishing
steadiness
glad
to
hear
it
in
fact
i
have
just
turned
into
my
teens
says
jobling
he
says
no
more
until
he
has
performed
his
task
which
he
achieves
as
guppy
and
smallweed
finish
theirs
thus
getting
over
the
ground
in
excellent
style
and
beating
those
two
gentlemen
easily
by
a
veal
and
ham
and
a
cabbage
now
small
says
guppy
what
would
you
recommend
about
pastry
marrow
puddings
says
smallweed
instantly
aye
aye
cries
jobling
with
an
arch
look
you
there
are
you
thank
you
guppy
i
do
know
but
what
i
will
take
a
marrow
pudding
three
marrow
puddings
being
produced
jobling
adds
in
a
pleasant
humour
that
he
is
coming
of
age
fast
to
these
succeed
by
command
of
smallweed
three
cheshires
and
to
those
three
small
rums
this
apex
of
the
entertainment
happily
reached
jobling
puts
up
his
legs
on
the
carpeted
seat
having
his
own
side
of
the
box
to
himself
leans
against
the
wall
and
says
i
am
grown
up
now
guppy
i
have
arrived
at
maturity
what
do
you
think
now
says
guppy
about
you
do
mind
smallweed
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
have
the
pleasure
of
drinking
his
good
health
sir
to
you
says
smallweed
i
was
saying
what
do
you
think
now
pursues
guppy
of
enlisting
why
what
i
may
think
after
dinner
returns
jobling
is
one
thing
my
dear
guppy
and
what
i
may
think
before
dinner
is
another
thing
still
even
after
dinner
i
ask
myself
the
question
what
am
i
to
do
how
am
i
to
live
ill
fo
manger
you
know
says
jobling
pronouncing
that
word
as
if
he
meant
a
necessary
fixture
in
an
english
stable
ill
fo
manger
that
the
french
saying
and
mangering
is
as
necessary
to
me
as
it
is
to
a
frenchman
or
more
so
smallweed
is
decidedly
of
opinion
much
more
so
if
any
man
had
told
me
pursues
jobling
even
so
lately
as
when
you
and
i
had
the
frisk
down
in
lincolnshire
guppy
and
drove
over
to
see
that
house
at
castle
wold
smallweed
corrects
him
chesney
wold
chesney
wold
i
thank
my
honourable
friend
for
that
cheer
if
any
man
had
told
me
then
that
i
should
be
as
hard
up
at
the
present
time
as
i
literally
find
myself
i
should
have
well
i
should
have
pitched
into
him
says
jobling
taking
a
little
with
an
air
of
desperate
resignation
i
should
have
let
fly
at
his
head
still
tony
you
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
post
then
remonstrates
guppy
you
were
talking
about
nothing
else
in
the
gig
guppy
says
jobling
i
will
not
deny
it
i
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
post
but
i
trusted
to
things
coming
round
that
very
popular
trust
in
flat
things
coming
round
not
in
their
being
beaten
round
or
worked
round
but
in
their
coming
round
as
though
a
lunatic
should
trust
in
the
world
coming
triangular
i
had
confident
expectations
that
things
would
come
round
and
be
all
square
says
jobling
with
some
vagueness
of
expression
and
perhaps
of
meaning
too
but
i
was
disappointed
they
never
did
and
when
it
came
to
creditors
making
rows
at
the
office
and
to
people
that
the
office
dealt
with
making
complaints
about
dirty
trifles
of
borrowed
money
why
there
was
an
end
of
that
connexion
and
of
any
new
professional
connexion
too
for
if
i
was
to
give
a
reference
it
would
be
mentioned
and
would
sew
me
up
then
what
a
fellow
to
do
i
have
been
keeping
out
of
the
way
and
living
cheap
down
about
the
but
what
the
use
of
living
cheap
when
you
have
got
no
money
you
might
as
well
live
dear
better
smallweed
thinks
certainly
it
the
fashionable
way
and
fashion
and
whiskers
have
been
my
weaknesses
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
says
jobling
they
are
great
weaknesses
damme
sir
they
are
great
well
proceeds
jobling
after
a
defiant
visit
to
his
what
can
a
fellow
do
i
ask
you
but
enlist
guppy
comes
more
fully
into
the
conversation
to
state
what
in
his
opinion
a
fellow
can
do
his
manner
is
the
gravely
impressive
manner
of
a
man
who
has
not
committed
himself
in
life
otherwise
than
as
he
has
become
the
victim
of
a
tender
sorrow
of
the
heart
jobling
says
guppy
myself
and
our
mutual
friend
smallweed
smallweed
modestly
observes
gentlemen
both
and
have
had
a
little
conversation
on
this
matter
more
than
once
since
you
say
got
the
sack
cries
jobling
bitterly
say
it
guppy
you
mean
it
left
the
inn
smallweed
delicately
suggests
since
you
left
the
inn
jobling
says
guppy
and
i
have
mentioned
to
our
mutual
friend
smallweed
a
plan
i
have
lately
thought
of
proposing
you
know
snagsby
the
stationer
i
know
there
is
such
a
stationer
returns
jobling
he
was
not
ours
and
i
am
not
acquainted
with
him
he
is
ours
jobling
and
i
am
acquainted
with
him
guppy
retorts
well
sir
i
have
lately
become
better
acquainted
with
him
through
some
accidental
circumstances
that
have
made
me
a
visitor
of
his
in
private
life
those
circumstances
it
is
not
necessary
to
offer
in
argument
they
may
or
they
may
not
have
some
reference
to
a
subject
which
may
or
may
not
have
cast
its
shadow
on
my
existence
as
it
is
guppy
perplexing
way
with
boastful
misery
to
tempt
his
particular
friends
into
this
subject
and
the
moment
they
touch
it
to
turn
on
them
with
that
trenchant
severity
about
the
chords
in
the
human
mind
both
jobling
and
smallweed
decline
the
pitfall
by
remaining
silent
such
things
may
be
repeats
guppy
or
they
may
not
be
they
are
no
part
of
the
case
it
is
enough
to
mention
that
both
and
snagsby
are
very
willing
to
oblige
me
and
that
snagsby
has
in
busy
times
a
good
deal
of
copying
work
to
give
out
he
has
all
tulkinghorn
and
an
excellent
business
besides
i
believe
if
our
mutual
friend
smallweed
were
put
into
the
box
he
could
prove
this
smallweed
nods
and
appears
greedy
to
be
sworn
now
gentlemen
of
the
jury
says
guppy
i
mean
now
jobling
you
may
say
this
is
a
poor
prospect
of
a
living
granted
but
it
better
than
nothing
and
better
than
enlistment
you
want
time
there
must
be
time
for
these
late
affairs
to
blow
over
you
might
live
through
it
on
much
worse
terms
than
by
writing
for
snagsby
jobling
is
about
to
interrupt
when
the
sagacious
smallweed
checks
him
with
a
dry
cough
and
the
words
hem
shakspeare
there
are
two
branches
to
this
subject
jobling
says
guppy
that
is
the
first
i
come
to
the
second
you
know
krook
the
chancellor
across
the
lane
come
jobling
says
guppy
in
his
encouraging
i
think
you
know
krook
the
chancellor
across
the
lane
i
know
him
by
sight
says
jobling
you
know
him
by
sight
very
well
and
you
know
little
flite
everybody
knows
her
says
jobling
everybody
knows
her
very
well
now
it
has
been
one
of
my
duties
of
late
to
pay
flite
a
certain
weekly
allowance
deducting
from
it
the
amount
of
her
weekly
rent
which
i
have
paid
in
consequence
of
instructions
i
have
received
to
krook
himself
regularly
in
her
presence
this
has
brought
me
into
communication
with
krook
and
into
a
knowledge
of
his
house
and
his
habits
i
know
he
has
a
room
to
let
you
may
live
there
at
a
very
low
charge
under
any
name
you
like
as
quietly
as
if
you
were
a
hundred
miles
off
he
ask
no
questions
and
would
accept
you
as
a
tenant
at
a
word
from
me
before
the
clock
strikes
if
you
chose
and
i
tell
you
another
thing
jobling
says
guppy
who
has
suddenly
lowered
his
voice
and
become
familiar
again
he
an
extraordinary
old
chap
always
rummaging
among
a
litter
of
papers
and
grubbing
away
at
teaching
himself
to
read
and
write
without
getting
on
a
bit
as
it
seems
to
me
he
is
a
most
extraordinary
old
chap
sir
i
do
know
but
what
it
might
be
worth
a
fellow
while
to
look
him
up
a
bit
you
do
mean
jobling
begins
i
mean
returns
guppy
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
becoming
modesty
that
i
ca
make
him
out
i
appeal
to
our
mutual
friend
smallweed
whether
he
has
or
has
not
heard
me
remark
that
i
ca
make
him
out
smallweed
bears
the
concise
testimony
a
few
i
have
seen
something
of
the
profession
and
something
of
life
tony
says
guppy
and
it
seldom
i
ca
make
a
man
out
more
or
less
but
such
an
old
card
as
this
so
deep
so
sly
and
secret
though
i
do
believe
he
is
ever
sober
i
never
came
across
now
he
must
be
precious
old
you
know
and
he
has
not
a
soul
about
him
and
he
is
reported
to
be
immensely
rich
and
whether
he
is
a
smuggler
or
a
receiver
or
an
unlicensed
pawnbroker
or
a
all
of
which
i
have
thought
likely
at
different
times
it
might
pay
you
to
knock
up
a
sort
of
knowledge
of
him
i
do
see
why
you
should
go
in
for
it
when
everything
else
suits
jobling
guppy
and
smallweed
all
lean
their
elbows
on
the
table
and
their
chins
upon
their
hands
and
look
at
the
ceiling
after
a
time
they
all
drink
slowly
lean
back
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
look
at
one
another
if
i
had
the
energy
i
once
possessed
tony
says
guppy
with
a
sigh
but
there
are
chords
in
the
human
mind
expressing
the
remainder
of
the
desolate
sentiment
in
guppy
concludes
by
resigning
the
adventure
to
tony
jobling
and
informing
him
that
during
the
vacation
and
while
things
are
slack
his
purse
as
far
as
three
or
four
or
even
five
pound
goes
will
be
at
his
disposal
for
never
shall
it
be
said
guppy
adds
with
emphasis
that
william
guppy
turned
his
back
upon
his
friend
the
latter
part
of
the
proposal
is
so
directly
to
the
purpose
that
jobling
says
with
emotion
guppy
my
trump
your
fist
guppy
presents
it
saying
jobling
my
boy
there
it
is
jobling
returns
guppy
we
have
been
pals
now
for
some
years
guppy
replies
jobling
we
have
they
then
shake
hands
and
jobling
adds
in
a
feeling
manner
thank
you
guppy
i
do
know
but
what
i
will
take
another
glass
for
old
acquaintance
sake
krook
last
lodger
died
there
observes
guppy
in
an
incidental
way
did
he
though
says
jobling
there
was
a
verdict
accidental
death
you
do
mind
that
no
says
jobling
i
do
mind
it
but
he
might
as
well
have
died
somewhere
else
it
devilish
odd
that
he
need
go
and
die
at
my
place
jobling
quite
resents
this
liberty
several
times
returning
to
it
with
such
remarks
as
there
are
places
enough
to
die
in
i
should
think
or
he
would
have
liked
my
dying
at
his
place
i
dare
say
however
the
compact
being
virtually
made
guppy
proposes
to
dispatch
the
trusty
smallweed
to
ascertain
if
krook
is
at
home
as
in
that
case
they
may
complete
the
negotiation
without
delay
jobling
approving
smallweed
puts
himself
under
the
tall
hat
and
conveys
it
out
of
the
in
the
guppy
manner
he
soon
returns
with
the
intelligence
that
krook
is
at
home
and
that
he
has
seen
him
through
the
sitting
in
the
back
premises
sleeping
like
one
then
i
pay
says
guppy
and
we
go
and
see
him
small
what
will
it
be
smallweed
compelling
the
attendance
of
the
waitress
with
one
hitch
of
his
eyelash
instantly
replies
as
follows

veals
and
hams

and
four
potatoes

and

and
one
summer
cabbage
is

in

a

out
not
at
all
excited
by
these
stupendous
calculations
smallweed
dismisses
his
friends
with
a
cool
nod
and
remains
behind
to
take
a
little
admiring
notice
of
polly
as
opportunity
may
serve
and
to
read
the
daily
papers
which
are
so
very
large
in
proportion
to
himself
shorn
of
his
hat
that
when
he
holds
up
the
times
to
run
his
eye
over
the
columns
he
seems
to
have
retired
for
the
night
and
to
have
disappeared
under
the
bedclothes
guppy
and
jobling
repair
to
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
where
they
find
krook
still
sleeping
like
one
that
is
to
say
breathing
stertorously
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
quite
insensible
to
any
external
sounds
or
even
to
gentle
shaking
on
the
table
beside
him
among
the
usual
lumber
stand
an
empty
and
a
glass
the
unwholesome
air
is
so
stained
with
this
liquor
that
even
the
green
eyes
of
the
cat
upon
her
shelf
as
they
open
and
shut
and
glimmer
on
the
visitors
look
drunk
hold
up
here
says
guppy
giving
the
relaxed
figure
of
the
old
man
another
shake
krook
halloa
sir
but
it
would
seem
as
easy
to
wake
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
with
a
spirituous
heat
smouldering
in
it
did
you
ever
see
such
a
stupor
as
he
falls
into
between
drink
and
sleep
says
guppy
if
this
is
his
regular
sleep
returns
jobling
rather
alarmed
it
last
a
long
time
one
of
these
days
i
am
thinking
it
always
more
like
a
fit
than
a
nap
says
guppy
shaking
him
again
halloa
your
lordship
why
he
might
be
robbed
fifty
times
over
open
your
eyes
after
much
ado
he
opens
them
but
without
appearing
to
see
his
visitors
or
any
other
objects
though
he
crosses
one
leg
on
another
and
folds
his
hands
and
several
times
closes
and
opens
his
parched
lips
he
seems
to
all
intents
and
purposes
as
insensible
as
before
he
is
alive
at
any
rate
says
guppy
how
are
you
my
lord
chancellor
i
have
brought
a
friend
of
mine
sir
on
a
little
matter
of
business
the
old
man
still
sits
often
smacking
his
dry
lips
without
the
least
consciousness
after
some
minutes
he
makes
an
attempt
to
rise
they
help
him
up
and
he
staggers
against
the
wall
and
stares
at
them
how
do
you
do
mr
krook
says
guppy
in
some
discomfiture
how
do
you
do
sir
you
are
looking
charming
krook
i
hope
you
are
pretty
well
the
old
man
in
aiming
a
purposeless
blow
at
guppy
or
at
nothing
feebly
swings
himself
round
and
comes
with
his
face
against
the
wall
so
he
remains
for
a
minute
or
two
heaped
up
against
it
and
then
staggers
down
the
shop
to
the
front
door
the
air
the
movement
in
the
court
the
lapse
of
time
or
the
combination
of
these
things
recovers
him
he
comes
back
pretty
steadily
adjusting
his
fur
cap
on
his
head
and
looking
keenly
at
them
your
servant
gentlemen
i
been
dozing
hi
i
am
hard
to
wake
odd
times
rather
so
indeed
sir
responds
guppy
what
you
been
to
do
it
have
you
says
the
suspicious
krook
only
a
little
guppy
explains
the
old
man
eye
resting
on
the
empty
bottle
he
takes
it
up
examines
it
and
slowly
tilts
it
upside
down
i
say
he
cries
like
the
hobgoblin
in
the
story
somebody
been
making
free
here
i
assure
you
we
found
it
so
says
guppy
would
you
allow
me
to
get
it
filled
for
you
yes
certainly
i
would
cries
krook
in
high
glee
certainly
i
would
do
mention
it
get
it
filled
next
door
sol
arms
the
lord
chancellor
fourteenpenny
bless
you
they
know
me
he
so
presses
the
empty
bottle
upon
guppy
that
that
gentleman
with
a
nod
to
his
friend
accepts
the
trust
and
hurries
out
and
hurries
in
again
with
the
bottle
filled
the
old
man
receives
it
in
his
arms
like
a
beloved
grandchild
and
pats
it
tenderly
but
i
say
he
whispers
with
his
eyes
screwed
up
after
tasting
it
this
ai
the
lord
chancellor
fourteenpenny
this
is
eighteenpenny
i
thought
you
might
like
that
better
says
guppy
you
a
nobleman
sir
returns
krook
with
another
taste
and
his
hot
breath
seems
to
come
towards
them
like
a
flame
you
a
baron
of
the
land
taking
advantage
of
this
auspicious
moment
guppy
presents
his
friend
under
the
impromptu
name
of
weevle
and
states
the
object
of
their
visit
krook
with
his
bottle
under
his
arm
he
never
gets
beyond
a
certain
point
of
either
drunkenness
or
sobriety
takes
time
to
survey
his
proposed
lodger
and
seems
to
approve
of
him
like
to
see
the
room
young
man
he
says
ah
it
a
good
room
been
whitewashed
been
cleaned
down
with
soft
soap
and
soda
hi
worth
twice
the
rent
letting
alone
my
company
when
you
want
it
and
such
a
cat
to
keep
the
mice
away
commending
the
room
after
this
manner
the
old
man
takes
them
upstairs
where
indeed
they
do
find
it
cleaner
than
it
used
to
be
and
also
containing
some
old
articles
of
furniture
which
he
has
dug
up
from
his
inexhaustible
stores
the
terms
are
easily
concluded
for
the
lord
chancellor
can
not
be
hard
on
guppy
associated
as
he
is
with
kenge
and
carboy
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
and
other
famous
claims
on
his
professional
consideration
and
it
is
agreed
that
weevle
shall
take
possession
on
the
morrow
weevle
and
guppy
then
repair
to
cook
court
cursitor
street
where
the
personal
introduction
of
the
former
to
snagsby
is
effected
and
more
important
the
vote
and
interest
of
snagsby
are
secured
they
then
report
progress
to
the
eminent
smallweed
waiting
at
the
office
in
his
tall
hat
for
that
purpose
and
separate
guppy
explaining
that
he
would
terminate
his
little
entertainment
by
standing
treat
at
the
play
but
that
there
are
chords
in
the
human
mind
which
would
render
it
a
hollow
mockery
on
the
morrow
in
the
dusk
of
evening
weevle
modestly
appears
at
krook
by
no
means
incommoded
with
luggage
and
establishes
himself
in
his
new
lodging
where
the
two
eyes
in
the
shutters
stare
at
him
in
his
sleep
as
if
they
were
full
of
wonder
on
the
following
day
weevle
who
is
a
handy
kind
of
young
fellow
borrows
a
needle
and
thread
of
miss
flite
and
a
hammer
of
his
landlord
and
goes
to
work
devising
apologies
for
and
knocking
up
apologies
for
shelves
and
hanging
up
his
two
teacups
milkpot
and
crockery
sundries
on
a
pennyworth
of
little
hooks
like
a
shipwrecked
sailor
making
the
best
of
it
but
what
weevle
prizes
most
of
all
his
few
possessions
next
after
his
light
whiskers
for
which
he
has
an
attachment
that
only
whiskers
can
awaken
in
the
breast
of
man
is
a
choice
collection
of
impressions
from
that
truly
national
work
the
divinities
of
albion
or
galaxy
gallery
of
british
beauty
representing
ladies
of
title
and
fashion
in
every
variety
of
smirk
that
art
combined
with
capital
is
capable
of
producing
with
these
magnificent
portraits
unworthily
confined
in
a
during
his
seclusion
among
the
he
decorates
his
apartment
and
as
the
galaxy

of
british

wears
every
variety
of
fancy
dress
plays
every
variety
of
musical
instrument
fondles
every
variety
of
dog
ogles
every
variety
of
prospect
and
is
backed
up
by
every
variety
of
and
balustrade
the
result
is
very
imposing
but
fashion
is
weevle
as
it
was
tony
jobling
weakness
to
borrow
yesterday
paper
from
the
sol
arms
of
an
evening
and
read
about
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
meteors
that
are
shooting
across
the
fashionable
sky
in
every
direction
is
unspeakable
consolation
to
him
to
know
what
member
of
what
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
accomplished
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
feat
of
joining
it
yesterday
or
contemplates
the
no
less
brilliant
and
distinguished
feat
of
leaving
it
gives
him
a
thrill
of
joy
to
be
informed
what
the
galaxy
gallery
of
british
beauty
is
about
and
means
to
be
about
and
what

to

of

weevle
reverts
from
this
intelligence
to
the

implicated
and
seems
to
know
the
originals
and
to
be
known
of
them
for
the

he
is
a
quiet
lodger
full
of
handy
shifts
and
devices
as
before
mentioned
able
to
cook
and
clean
for
himself
as
well
as
to
carpenter
and
developing
social
inclinations
after
the
shades
of
evening
have
fallen
on
the
court
at
those
times
when
he
is
not
visited
by
guppy
or
by
a
small
light
in
his
likeness
quenched
in
a
dark
hat
he
comes
out
of
his
dull
room
where
he
has
inherited
the
deal
wilderness
of
desk
bespattered
with
a
rain
of
ink
and
talks
to
krook
or
is
very
free
as
they
call
it
in
the

commendingly
with
any

disposed
for

wherefore
piper
who
leads
the

is
impelled
to
offer
two
remarks
to
perkins
firstly
that
if
her
johnny
was
to
have
whiskers
she
could
wish
to
be
identically
like
that
young
man
and
secondly
mark
my
words

chapter
xxi
the
smallweed
family
in
a
rather
and
neighbourhood
though
one
of
its
rising
grounds
bears
the
name
of
mount
pleasant
the
elfin
smallweed
christened
bartholomew
and
known
on
the
domestic
hearth
as
bart
passes
that
limited
portion
of
his
time
on
which
the
office
and
its
contingencies
have
no
claim
he
dwells
in
a
little
narrow
street
always
solitary
shady
and
sad
closely
bricked
in
on
all
sides
like
a
tomb
but
where
there
yet
lingers
the
stump
of
an
old
forest
tree
whose
flavour
is
about
as
fresh
and
natural
as
the
smallweed
smack
of
youth
there
has
been
only
one
child
in
the
smallweed
family
for
several
generations
little
old
men
and
women
there
have
been
but
no
child
until
smallweed
grandmother
now
living
became
weak
in
her
intellect
and
fell
for
the
first
time
into
a
childish
state
with
such
infantine
graces
as
a
total
want
of
observation
memory
understanding
and
interest
and
an
eternal
disposition
to
fall
asleep
over
the
fire
and
into
it
smallweed
grandmother
has
undoubtedly
brightened
the
family
smallweed
grandfather
is
likewise
of
the
party
he
is
in
a
helpless
condition
as
to
his
lower
and
nearly
so
as
to
his
upper
limbs
but
his
mind
is
unimpaired
it
holds
as
well
as
it
ever
held
the
first
four
rules
of
arithmetic
and
a
certain
small
collection
of
the
hardest
facts
in
respect
of
ideality
reverence
wonder
and
other
such
phrenological
attributes
it
is
no
worse
off
than
it
used
to
be
everything
that
smallweed
grandfather
ever
put
away
in
his
mind
was
a
grub
at
first
and
is
a
grub
at
last
in
all
his
life
he
has
never
bred
a
single
butterfly
the
father
of
this
pleasant
grandfather
of
the
neighbourhood
of
mount
pleasant
was
a
species
of
spider
who
spun
webs
to
catch
unwary
flies
and
retired
into
holes
until
they
were
entrapped
the
name
of
this
old
god
was
compound
interest
he
lived
for
it
married
it
died
of
it
meeting
with
a
heavy
loss
in
an
honest
little
enterprise
in
which
all
the
loss
was
intended
to
have
been
on
the
other
side
he
broke
something
something
necessary
to
his
existence
therefore
it
could
have
been
his
heart
and
made
an
end
of
his
career
as
his
character
was
not
good
and
he
had
been
bred
at
a
charity
school
in
a
complete
course
according
to
question
and
answer
of
those
ancient
people
the
amorites
and
hittites
he
was
frequently
quoted
as
an
example
of
the
failure
of
education
his
spirit
shone
through
his
son
to
whom
he
had
always
preached
of
going
out
early
in
life
and
whom
he
made
a
clerk
in
a
sharp
scrivener
office
at
twelve
years
old
there
the
young
gentleman
improved
his
mind
which
was
of
a
lean
and
anxious
character
and
developing
the
family
gifts
gradually
elevated
himself
into
the
discounting
profession
going
out
early
in
life
and
marrying
late
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
he
too
begat
a
lean
and
son
who
in
his
turn
going
out
early
in
life
and
marrying
late
became
the
father
of
bartholomew
and
judith
smallweed
twins
during
the
whole
time
consumed
in
the
slow
growth
of
this
family
tree
the
house
of
smallweed
always
early
to
go
out
and
late
to
marry
has
strengthened
itself
in
its
practical
character
has
discarded
all
amusements
discountenanced
all
fictions
and
fables
and
banished
all
levities
whatsoever
hence
the
gratifying
fact
that
it
has
had
no
child
born
to
it
and
that
the
complete
little
men
and
women
whom
it
has
produced
have
been
observed
to
bear
a
likeness
to
old
monkeys
with
something
depressing
on
their
minds
at
the
present
time
in
the
dark
little
parlour
certain
feet
below
the
level
of
the
street
a
grim
hard
uncouth
parlour
only
ornamented
with
the
coarsest
of
baize
and
the
hardest
of
and
offering
in
its
decorative
character
no
bad
allegorical
representation
of
grandfather
mind
seated
in
two
black
horsehair
porter
chairs
one
on
each
side
of
the
the
superannuated
and
smallweed
while
away
the
rosy
hours
on
the
stove
are
a
couple
of
trivets
for
the
pots
and
kettles
which
it
is
grandfather
smallweed
usual
occupation
to
watch
and
projecting
from
the
between
them
is
a
sort
of
brass
gallows
for
roasting
which
he
also
superintends
when
it
is
in
action
under
the
venerable
smallweed
seat
and
guarded
by
his
spindle
legs
is
a
drawer
in
his
chair
reported
to
contain
property
to
a
fabulous
amount
beside
him
is
a
spare
cushion
with
which
he
is
always
provided
in
order
that
he
may
have
something
to
throw
at
the
venerable
partner
of
his
respected
age
whenever
she
makes
an
allusion
to
money
a
subject
on
which
he
is
particularly
sensitive
and
where
bart
grandfather
smallweed
inquires
of
judy
twin
sister
he
a
come
in
yet
says
judy
it
his
is
it
no
how
much
do
you
mean
to
say
it
wants
then
ten
minutes
hey
ten
minutes
loud
on
the
part
of
judy
ho
says
grandfather
smallweed
ten
minutes
grandmother
smallweed
who
has
been
mumbling
and
shaking
her
head
at
the
trivets
hearing
figures
mentioned
connects
them
with
money
and
screeches
like
a
horrible
old
parrot
without
any
plumage
ten
notes
grandfather
smallweed
immediately
throws
the
cushion
at
her
drat
you
be
quiet
says
the
good
old
man
the
effect
of
this
act
of
jaculation
is
twofold
it
not
only
doubles
up
smallweed
head
against
the
side
of
her
porter
chair
and
causes
her
to
present
when
extricated
by
her
granddaughter
a
highly
unbecoming
state
of
cap
but
the
necessary
exertion
recoils
on
smallweed
himself
whom
it
throws
back
into
his
porter
chair
like
a
broken
puppet
the
excellent
old
gentleman
being
at
these
times
a
mere
with
a
black
on
the
top
of
it
does
not
present
a
very
animated
appearance
until
he
has
undergone
the
two
operations
at
the
hands
of
his
granddaughter
of
being
shaken
up
like
a
great
bottle
and
poked
and
punched
like
a
great
bolster
some
indication
of
a
neck
being
developed
in
him
by
these
means
he
and
the
sharer
of
his
life
evening
again
fronting
one
another
in
their
two
porter
chairs
like
a
couple
of
sentinels
long
forgotten
on
their
post
by
the
black
serjeant
death
judy
the
twin
is
worthy
company
for
these
associates
she
is
so
indubitably
sister
to
smallweed
the
younger
that
the
two
kneaded
into
one
would
hardly
make
a
young
person
of
average
proportions
while
she
so
happily
exemplifies
the
family
likeness
to
the
monkey
tribe
that
attired
in
a
spangled
robe
and
cap
she
might
walk
about
the
on
the
top
of
a
without
exciting
much
remark
as
an
unusual
specimen
under
existing
circumstances
however
she
is
dressed
in
a
plain
spare
gown
of
brown
stuff
judy
never
owned
a
doll
never
heard
of
cinderella
never
played
at
any
game
she
once
or
twice
fell
into
children
company
when
she
was
about
ten
years
old
but
the
children
could
get
on
with
judy
and
judy
could
get
on
with
them
she
seemed
like
an
animal
of
another
species
and
there
was
instinctive
repugnance
on
both
sides
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
judy
knows
how
to
laugh
she
has
so
rarely
seen
the
thing
done
that
the
probabilities
are
strong
the
other
way
of
anything
like
a
youthful
laugh
she
certainly
can
have
no
conception
if
she
were
to
try
one
she
would
find
her
teeth
in
her
way
modelling
that
action
of
her
face
as
she
has
unconsciously
modelled
all
its
other
expressions
on
her
pattern
of
sordid
age
such
is
judy
and
her
twin
brother
could
wind
up
a
top
for
his
life
he
knows
no
more
of
jack
the
giant
killer
or
of
sinbad
the
sailor
than
he
knows
of
the
people
in
the
stars
he
could
as
soon
play
at
or
at
cricket
as
change
into
a
cricket
or
a
frog
himself
but
he
is
so
much
the
better
off
than
his
sister
that
on
his
narrow
world
of
fact
an
opening
has
dawned
into
such
broader
regions
as
lie
within
the
ken
of
guppy
hence
his
admiration
and
his
emulation
of
that
shining
enchanter
judy
with
a
clash
and
clatter
sets
one
of
the
on
the
table
and
arranges
cups
and
saucers
the
bread
she
puts
on
in
an
iron
basket
and
the
butter
and
not
much
of
it
in
a
small
pewter
plate
grandfather
smallweed
looks
hard
after
the
tea
as
it
is
served
out
and
asks
judy
where
the
girl
is
charley
do
you
mean
says
judy
hey
from
grandfather
smallweed
charley
do
you
mean
this
touches
a
spring
in
grandmother
smallweed
who
chuckling
as
usual
at
the
trivets
cries
over
the
water
charley
over
the
water
charley
over
the
water
over
the
water
to
charley
charley
over
the
water
over
the
water
to
charley
and
becomes
quite
energetic
about
it
grandfather
looks
at
the
cushion
but
has
not
sufficiently
recovered
his
late
exertion
ha
he
says
when
there
is
silence
if
that
her
name
she
eats
a
deal
it
would
be
better
to
allow
her
for
her
keep
judy
with
her
brother
wink
shakes
her
head
and
purses
up
her
mouth
into
no
without
saying
it
no
returns
the
old
man
why
not
she
want
sixpence
a
day
and
we
can
do
it
for
less
says
judy
sure
judy
answers
with
a
nod
of
deepest
meaning
and
calls
as
she
scrapes
the
butter
on
the
loaf
with
every
precaution
against
waste
and
cuts
it
into
slices
you
charley
where
are
you
timidly
obedient
to
the
summons
a
little
girl
in
a
rough
apron
and
a
large
bonnet
with
her
hands
covered
with
soap
and
water
and
a
scrubbing
brush
in
one
of
them
appears
and
curtsys
what
work
are
you
about
now
says
judy
making
an
ancient
snap
at
her
like
a
very
sharp
old
beldame
i
the
upstairs
back
room
miss
replies
charley
mind
you
do
it
thoroughly
and
do
loiter
shirking
wo
do
for
me
make
haste
go
along
cries
judy
with
a
stamp
upon
the
ground
you
girls
are
more
trouble
than
you
worth
by
half
on
this
severe
matron
as
she
returns
to
her
task
of
scraping
the
butter
and
cutting
the
bread
falls
the
shadow
of
her
brother
looking
in
at
the
window
for
whom
knife
and
loaf
in
hand
she
opens
the
aye
aye
bart
says
grandfather
smallweed
here
you
are
hey
here
i
am
says
bart
been
along
with
your
friend
again
bart
small
nods
dining
at
his
expense
bart
small
nods
again
that
right
live
at
his
expense
as
much
as
you
can
and
take
warning
by
his
foolish
example
that
the
use
of
such
a
friend
the
only
use
you
can
put
him
to
says
the
venerable
sage
his
grandson
without
receiving
this
good
counsel
as
dutifully
as
he
might
honours
it
with
all
such
acceptance
as
may
lie
in
a
slight
wink
and
a
nod
and
takes
a
chair
at
the
the
four
old
faces
then
hover
over
teacups
like
a
company
of
ghastly
cherubim
smallweed
perpetually
twitching
her
head
and
chattering
at
the
trivets
and
smallweed
requiring
to
be
repeatedly
shaken
up
like
a
large
black
draught
yes
yes
says
the
good
old
gentleman
reverting
to
his
lesson
of
wisdom
that
such
advice
as
your
father
would
have
given
you
bart
you
never
saw
your
father
more
the
pity
he
was
my
true
son
whether
it
is
intended
to
be
conveyed
that
he
was
particularly
pleasant
to
look
at
on
that
account
does
not
appear
he
was
my
true
son
repeats
the
old
gentleman
folding
his
bread
and
butter
on
his
knee
a
good
accountant
and
died
fifteen
years
ago
smallweed
following
her
usual
instinct
breaks
out
with
fifteen
hundred
pound
fifteen
hundred
pound
in
a
black
box
fifteen
hundred
pound
locked
up
fifteen
hundred
pound
put
away
and
hid
her
worthy
husband
setting
aside
his
bread
and
butter
immediately
discharges
the
cushion
at
her
crushes
her
against
the
side
of
her
chair
and
falls
back
in
his
own
overpowered
his
appearance
after
visiting
smallweed
with
one
of
these
admonitions
is
particularly
impressive
and
not
wholly
prepossessing
firstly
because
the
exertion
generally
twists
his
black
over
one
eye
and
gives
him
an
air
of
goblin
rakishness
secondly
because
he
mutters
violent
imprecations
against
smallweed
and
thirdly
because
the
contrast
between
those
powerful
expressions
and
his
powerless
figure
is
suggestive
of
a
baleful
old
malignant
who
would
be
very
wicked
if
he
could
all
this
however
is
so
common
in
the
smallweed
family
circle
that
it
produces
no
impression
the
old
gentleman
is
merely
shaken
and
has
his
internal
feathers
beaten
up
the
cushion
is
restored
to
its
usual
place
beside
him
and
the
old
lady
perhaps
with
her
cap
adjusted
and
perhaps
not
is
planted
in
her
chair
again
ready
to
be
bowled
down
like
a
ninepin
some
time
elapses
in
the
present
instance
before
the
old
gentleman
is
sufficiently
cool
to
resume
his
discourse
and
even
then
he
mixes
it
up
with
several
edifying
expletives
addressed
to
the
unconscious
partner
of
his
bosom
who
holds
communication
with
nothing
on
earth
but
the
trivets
as
thus
if
your
father
bart
had
lived
longer
he
might
have
been
worth
a
deal
of
money
you
brimstone
chatterer
but
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
build
up
the
house
that
he
had
been
making
the
foundations
for
through
many
a
year
you
jade
of
a
magpie
jackdaw
and
what
do
you
mean
he
took
ill
and
died
of
a
low
fever
always
being
a
sparing
and
a
spare
man
full
of
business
care
i
should
like
to
throw
a
cat
at
you
instead
of
a
cushion
and
i
will
too
if
you
make
such
a
confounded
fool
of
yourself
and
your
mother
who
was
a
prudent
woman
as
dry
as
a
chip
just
dwindled
away
like
touchwood
after
you
and
judy
were
born
you
are
an
old
pig
you
are
a
brimstone
pig
you
a
head
of
swine
judy
not
interested
in
what
she
has
often
heard
begins
to
collect
in
a
basin
various
tributary
streams
of
tea
from
the
bottoms
of
cups
and
saucers
and
from
the
bottom
of
the
for
the
little
charwoman
evening
meal
in
like
manner
she
gets
together
in
the
iron
as
many
outside
fragments
and
heels
of
loaves
as
the
rigid
economy
of
the
house
has
left
in
existence
but
your
father
and
me
were
partners
bart
says
the
old
gentleman
and
when
i
am
gone
you
and
judy
will
have
all
there
is
it
rare
for
you
both
that
you
went
out
early
in
life
judy
to
the
flower
business
and
you
to
the
law
you
wo
want
to
spend
it
you
get
your
living
without
it
and
put
more
to
it
when
i
am
gone
judy
will
go
back
to
the
flower
business
and
you
still
stick
to
the
law
one
might
infer
from
judy
appearance
that
her
business
rather
lay
with
the
thorns
than
the
flowers
but
she
has
in
her
time
been
apprenticed
to
the
art
and
mystery
of
artificial
a
close
observer
might
perhaps
detect
both
in
her
eye
and
her
brother
when
their
venerable
grandsire
anticipates
his
being
gone
some
little
impatience
to
know
when
he
may
be
going
and
some
resentful
opinion
that
it
is
time
he
went
now
if
everybody
has
done
says
judy
completing
her
preparations
i
have
that
girl
in
to
her
tea
she
would
never
leave
off
if
she
took
it
by
herself
in
the
kitchen
charley
is
accordingly
introduced
and
under
a
heavy
fire
of
eyes
sits
down
to
her
basin
and
a
druidical
ruin
of
bread
and
butter
in
the
active
superintendence
of
this
young
person
judy
smallweed
appears
to
attain
a
perfectly
geological
age
and
to
date
from
the
remotest
periods
her
systematic
manner
of
flying
at
her
and
pouncing
on
her
with
or
without
pretence
whether
or
no
is
wonderful
evincing
an
accomplishment
in
the
art
of
seldom
reached
by
the
oldest
practitioners
now
do
stare
about
you
all
the
afternoon
cries
judy
shaking
her
head
and
stamping
her
foot
as
she
happens
to
catch
the
glance
which
has
been
previously
sounding
the
basin
of
tea
but
take
your
victuals
and
get
back
to
your
work
yes
miss
says
charley
do
say
yes
returns
miss
smallweed
for
i
know
what
you
girls
are
do
it
without
saying
it
and
then
i
may
begin
to
believe
you
charley
swallows
a
great
gulp
of
tea
in
token
of
submission
and
so
disperses
the
druidical
ruins
that
miss
smallweed
charges
her
not
to
gormandize
which
in
you
girls
she
observes
is
disgusting
charley
might
find
some
more
difficulty
in
meeting
her
views
on
the
general
subject
of
girls
but
for
a
knock
at
the
door
see
who
it
is
and
do
chew
when
you
open
it
cries
judy
the
object
of
her
attentions
withdrawing
for
the
purpose
miss
smallweed
takes
that
opportunity
of
jumbling
the
remainder
of
the
bread
and
butter
together
and
launching
two
or
three
dirty
into
the
of
the
basin
of
tea
as
a
hint
that
she
considers
the
eating
and
drinking
terminated
now
who
is
it
and
what
wanted
says
the
snappish
judy
it
is
one
george
it
appears
without
other
announcement
or
ceremony
george
walks
in
whew
says
george
you
are
hot
here
always
a
fire
eh
well
perhaps
you
do
right
to
get
used
to
one
george
makes
the
latter
remark
to
himself
as
he
nods
to
grandfather
smallweed
ho
it
you
cries
the
old
gentleman
how
de
do
how
de
do
middling
replies
george
taking
a
chair
your
granddaughter
i
have
had
the
honour
of
seeing
before
my
service
to
you
miss
this
is
my
grandson
says
grandfather
smallweed
you
seen
him
before
he
is
in
the
law
and
not
much
at
home
my
service
to
him
too
he
is
like
his
sister
he
is
very
like
his
sister
he
is
devilish
like
his
sister
says
george
laying
a
great
and
not
altogether
complimentary
stress
on
his
last
adjective
and
how
does
the
world
use
you
mr
george
grandfather
smallweed
inquires
slowly
rubbing
his
legs
pretty
much
as
usual
like
a
football
he
is
a
swarthy
brown
man
of
fifty
well
made
and
good
looking
with
crisp
dark
hair
bright
eyes
and
a
broad
chest
his
sinewy
and
powerful
hands
as
sunburnt
as
his
face
have
evidently
been
used
to
a
pretty
rough
life
what
is
curious
about
him
is
that
he
sits
forward
on
his
chair
as
if
he
were
from
long
habit
allowing
space
for
some
dress
or
accoutrements
that
he
has
altogether
laid
aside
his
step
too
is
measured
and
heavy
and
would
go
well
with
a
weighty
clash
and
jingle
of
spurs
he
is
now
but
his
mouth
is
set
as
if
his
upper
lip
had
been
for
years
familiar
with
a
great
moustache
and
his
manner
of
occasionally
laying
the
open
palm
of
his
broad
brown
hand
upon
it
is
to
the
same
effect
altogether
one
might
guess
george
to
have
been
a
trooper
once
upon
a
time
a
special
contrast
george
makes
to
the
smallweed
family
trooper
was
never
yet
billeted
upon
a
household
more
unlike
him
it
is
a
broadsword
to
an
his
developed
figure
and
their
stunted
forms
his
large
manner
filling
any
amount
of
room
and
their
little
narrow
pinched
ways
his
sounding
voice
and
their
sharp
spare
tones
are
in
the
strongest
and
the
strangest
opposition
as
he
sits
in
the
middle
of
the
grim
parlour
leaning
a
little
forward
with
his
hands
upon
his
thighs
and
his
elbows
squared
he
looks
as
though
if
he
remained
there
long
he
would
absorb
into
himself
the
whole
family
and
the
whole
house
extra
little
and
all
do
you
rub
your
legs
to
rub
life
into
he
asks
of
grandfather
smallweed
after
looking
round
the
room
why
it
partly
a
habit
george
and
yes
it
partly
helps
the
circulation
he
replies
the
repeats
george
folding
his
arms
upon
his
chest
and
seeming
to
become
two
sizes
larger
not
much
of
that
i
should
think
truly
i
old
george
says
grandfather
smallweed
but
i
can
carry
my
years
i
older
than
her
nodding
at
his
wife
and
see
what
she
is
you
a
brimstone
chatterer
with
a
sudden
revival
of
his
late
hostility
unlucky
old
soul
says
george
turning
his
head
in
that
direction
do
scold
the
old
lady
look
at
her
here
with
her
poor
cap
half
off
her
head
and
her
poor
hair
all
in
a
muddle
hold
up
that
better
there
we
are
think
of
your
mother
smallweed
says
george
coming
back
to
his
seat
from
assisting
her
if
your
wife
a
enough
i
suppose
you
were
an
excellent
son
mr
george
the
old
man
hints
with
a
leer
the
colour
of
george
face
rather
deepens
as
he
replies
why
no
i
was
i
am
astonished
at
it
so
am
i
ought
to
have
been
a
good
son
and
i
think
i
meant
to
have
been
one
but
i
was
i
was
a
thundering
bad
son
that
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
and
never
was
a
credit
to
anybody
surprising
cries
the
old
man
however
george
resumes
the
less
said
about
it
the
better
now
come
you
know
the
agreement
always
a
pipe
out
of
the
two
months
interest
bosh
it
all
correct
you
need
be
afraid
to
order
the
pipe
here
the
new
bill
and
here
the
two
and
a
of
a
scrape
it
is
to
get
it
together
in
my
business
george
sits
with
his
arms
folded
consuming
the
family
and
the
parlour
while
grandfather
smallweed
is
assisted
by
judy
to
two
black
leathern
cases
out
of
a
locked
bureau
in
one
of
which
he
secures
the
document
he
has
just
received
and
from
the
other
takes
another
similar
document
which
he
hands
to
george
who
twists
it
up
for
a
pipelight
as
the
old
man
inspects
through
his
glasses
every
and
of
both
documents
before
he
releases
them
from
their
leathern
prison
and
as
he
counts
the
money
three
times
over
and
requires
judy
to
say
every
word
she
utters
at
least
twice
and
is
as
tremulously
slow
of
speech
and
action
as
it
is
possible
to
be
this
business
is
a
long
time
in
progress
when
it
is
quite
concluded
and
not
before
he
disengages
his
ravenous
eyes
and
fingers
from
it
and
answers
george
last
remark
by
saying
afraid
to
order
the
pipe
we
are
not
so
mercenary
as
that
sir
judy
see
directly
to
the
pipe
and
the
glass
of
cold
for
mr
george
the
sportive
twins
who
have
been
looking
straight
before
them
all
this
time
except
when
they
have
been
engrossed
by
the
black
leathern
cases
retire
together
generally
disdainful
of
the
visitor
but
leaving
him
to
the
old
man
as
two
young
cubs
might
leave
a
traveller
to
the
parental
bear
and
there
you
sit
i
suppose
all
the
day
long
eh
says
george
with
folded
arms
just
so
just
so
the
old
man
nods
and
do
you
occupy
yourself
at
all
i
watch
the
fire
and
the
boiling
and
the
roasting
when
there
is
any
says
george
with
great
expression
just
so
when
there
is
any
do
you
read
or
get
read
to
the
old
man
shakes
his
head
with
sharp
sly
triumph
no
no
we
have
never
been
readers
in
our
family
it
do
pay
stuff
idleness
folly
no
no
there
not
much
to
choose
between
your
two
states
says
the
visitor
in
a
key
too
low
for
the
old
man
dull
hearing
as
he
looks
from
him
to
the
old
woman
and
back
again
i
say
in
a
louder
voice
i
hear
you
you
sell
me
up
at
last
i
suppose
when
i
am
a
day
in
arrear
my
dear
friend
cries
grandfather
smallweed
stretching
out
both
hands
to
embrace
him
never
never
my
dear
friend
but
my
friend
in
the
city
that
i
got
to
lend
you
the
money
he
might
oh
you
ca
answer
for
him
says
george
finishing
the
inquiry
in
his
lower
key
with
the
words
you
lying
old
rascal
my
dear
friend
he
is
not
to
be
depended
on
i
would
trust
him
he
will
have
his
bond
my
dear
friend
devil
doubt
him
says
george
charley
appearing
with
a
tray
on
which
are
the
pipe
a
small
paper
of
tobacco
and
the
he
asks
her
how
do
you
come
here
you
have
got
the
family
face
i
goes
out
to
work
sir
returns
charley
the
trooper
if
trooper
he
be
or
have
been
takes
her
bonnet
off
with
a
light
touch
for
so
strong
a
hand
and
pats
her
on
the
head
you
give
the
house
almost
a
wholesome
look
it
wants
a
bit
of
youth
as
much
as
it
wants
fresh
air
then
he
dismisses
her
lights
his
pipe
and
drinks
to
smallweed
friend
in
the
city
the
one
solitary
flight
of
that
esteemed
old
gentleman
imagination
so
you
think
he
might
be
hard
upon
me
eh
i
think
he
might
i
am
afraid
he
would
i
have
known
him
do
it
says
grandfather
smallweed
incautiously
twenty
times
incautiously
because
his
stricken
who
has
been
dozing
over
the
fire
for
some
time
is
instantly
aroused
and
jabbers
twenty
thousand
pounds
twenty
notes
in
a
twenty
guineas
twenty
million
twenty
per
cent
twenty
and
is
then
cut
short
by
the
flying
cushion
which
the
visitor
to
whom
this
singular
experiment
appears
to
be
a
novelty
snatches
from
her
face
as
it
crushes
her
in
the
usual
manner
you
a
brimstone
idiot
you
a
scorpion
a
brimstone
scorpion
you
a
sweltering
toad
you
a
chattering
clattering
broomstick
witch
that
ought
to
be
burnt
gasps
the
old
man
prostrate
in
his
chair
my
dear
friend
will
you
shake
me
up
a
little
george
who
has
been
looking
first
at
one
of
them
and
then
at
the
other
as
if
he
were
demented
takes
his
venerable
acquaintance
by
the
throat
on
receiving
this
request
and
dragging
him
upright
in
his
chair
as
easily
as
if
he
were
a
doll
appears
in
two
minds
whether
or
no
to
shake
all
future
power
of
cushioning
out
of
him
and
shake
him
into
his
grave
resisting
the
temptation
but
agitating
him
violently
enough
to
make
his
head
roll
like
a
harlequin
he
puts
him
smartly
down
in
his
chair
again
and
adjusts
his
with
such
a
rub
that
the
old
man
winks
with
both
eyes
for
a
minute
afterwards
o
lord
gasps
smallweed
that
do
thank
you
my
dear
friend
that
do
oh
dear
me
i
out
of
breath
o
lord
and
smallweed
says
it
not
without
evident
apprehensions
of
his
dear
friend
who
still
stands
over
him
looming
larger
than
ever
the
alarming
presence
however
gradually
subsides
into
its
chair
and
falls
to
smoking
in
long
puffs
consoling
itself
with
the
philosophical
reflection
the
name
of
your
friend
in
the
city
begins
with
a
d
comrade
and
you
about
right
respecting
the
bond
did
you
speak
mr
george
inquires
the
old
man
the
trooper
shakes
his
head
and
leaning
forward
with
his
right
elbow
on
his
right
knee
and
his
pipe
supported
in
that
hand
while
his
other
hand
resting
on
his
left
leg
squares
his
left
elbow
in
a
martial
manner
continues
to
smoke
meanwhile
he
looks
at
smallweed
with
grave
attention
and
now
and
then
fans
the
cloud
of
smoke
away
in
order
that
he
may
see
him
the
more
clearly
i
take
it
he
says
making
just
as
much
and
as
little
change
in
his
position
as
will
enable
him
to
reach
the
glass
to
his
lips
with
a
round
full
action
that
i
am
the
only
man
alive
or
dead
either
that
gets
the
value
of
a
pipe
out
of
you
well
returns
the
old
man
it
true
that
i
do
see
company
george
and
that
i
do
treat
i
ca
afford
to
it
but
as
you
in
your
pleasant
way
made
your
pipe
a
condition
why
it
not
for
the
value
of
it
that
no
great
thing
it
was
a
fancy
to
get
it
out
of
you
to
have
something
in
for
my
money
ha
you
prudent
prudent
sir
cries
grandfather
smallweed
rubbing
his
legs
very
i
always
was
puff
it
a
sure
sign
of
my
prudence
that
i
ever
found
the
way
here
puff
also
that
i
am
what
i
am
puff
i
am
well
known
to
be
prudent
says
george
composedly
smoking
i
rose
in
life
that
way
do
be
sir
you
may
rise
yet
george
laughs
and
drinks
you
no
relations
now
asks
grandfather
smallweed
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
who
would
pay
off
this
little
principal
or
who
would
lend
you
a
good
name
or
two
that
i
could
persuade
my
friend
in
the
city
to
make
you
a
further
advance
upon
two
good
names
would
be
sufficient
for
my
friend
in
the
city
you
no
such
relations
mr
george
george
still
composedly
smoking
replies
if
i
had
i
trouble
them
i
have
been
trouble
enough
to
my
belongings
in
my
day
it
may
be
a
very
good
sort
of
penitence
in
a
vagabond
who
has
wasted
the
best
time
of
his
life
to
go
back
then
to
decent
people
that
he
never
was
a
credit
to
and
live
upon
them
but
it
not
my
sort
the
best
kind
of
amends
then
for
having
gone
away
is
to
keep
away
in
my
opinion
but
natural
affection
george
hints
grandfather
smallweed
for
two
good
names
hey
says
george
shaking
his
head
and
still
composedly
smoking
no
that
not
my
sort
either
grandfather
smallweed
has
been
gradually
sliding
down
in
his
chair
since
his
last
adjustment
and
is
now
a
bundle
of
clothes
with
a
voice
in
it
calling
for
judy
that
houri
appearing
shakes
him
up
in
the
usual
manner
and
is
charged
by
the
old
gentleman
to
remain
near
him
for
he
seems
chary
of
putting
his
visitor
to
the
trouble
of
repeating
his
late
attentions
ha
he
observes
when
he
is
in
trim
again
if
you
could
have
traced
out
the
captain
george
it
would
have
been
the
making
of
you
if
when
you
first
came
here
in
consequence
of
our
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
when
i
say
i
alluding
to
the
advertisements
of
my
friend
in
the
city
and
one
or
two
others
who
embark
their
capital
in
the
same
way
and
are
so
friendly
towards
me
as
sometimes
to
give
me
a
lift
with
my
little
pittance
if
at
that
time
you
could
have
helped
us
george
it
would
have
been
the
making
of
you
i
was
willing
enough
to
be
as
you
call
it
says
george
smoking
not
quite
so
placidly
as
before
for
since
the
entrance
of
judy
he
has
been
in
some
measure
disturbed
by
a
fascination
not
of
the
admiring
kind
which
obliges
him
to
look
at
her
as
she
stands
by
her
grandfather
chair
but
on
the
whole
i
am
glad
i
was
now
why
george
in
the
name
of
of
brimstone
why
says
grandfather
smallweed
with
a
plain
appearance
of
exasperation
brimstone
apparently
suggested
by
his
eye
lighting
on
smallweed
in
her
slumber
for
two
reasons
comrade
and
what
two
reasons
george
in
the
name
of
the
of
our
friend
in
the
city
suggests
george
composedly
drinking
aye
if
you
like
what
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
returns
george
but
still
looking
at
judy
as
if
she
being
so
old
and
so
like
her
grandfather
it
is
indifferent
which
of
the
two
he
addresses
you
gentlemen
took
me
in
you
advertised
that
hawdon
captain
hawdon
if
you
hold
to
the
saying
a
captain
always
a
captain
was
to
hear
of
something
to
his
advantage
well
returns
the
old
man
shrilly
and
sharply
well
says
george
smoking
on
it
would
have
been
much
to
his
advantage
to
have
been
clapped
into
prison
by
the
whole
bill
and
judgment
trade
of
london
how
do
you
know
that
some
of
his
rich
relations
might
have
paid
his
debts
or
compounded
for
besides
he
had
taken
us
in
he
owed
us
immense
sums
all
round
i
would
sooner
have
strangled
him
than
had
no
return
if
i
sit
here
thinking
of
him
snarls
the
old
man
holding
up
his
impotent
ten
fingers
i
want
to
strangle
him
now
and
in
a
sudden
access
of
fury
he
throws
the
cushion
at
the
unoffending
smallweed
but
it
passes
harmlessly
on
one
side
of
her
chair
i
do
need
to
be
told
returns
the
trooper
taking
his
pipe
from
his
lips
for
a
moment
and
carrying
his
eyes
back
from
following
the
progress
of
the
cushion
to
the
which
is
burning
low
that
he
carried
on
heavily
and
went
to
ruin
i
have
been
at
his
right
hand
many
a
day
when
he
was
charging
upon
ruin
i
was
with
him
when
he
was
sick
and
well
rich
and
poor
i
laid
this
hand
upon
him
after
he
had
run
through
everything
and
broken
down
everything
beneath
him
when
he
held
a
pistol
to
his
head
i
wish
he
had
let
it
off
says
the
benevolent
old
man
and
blown
his
head
into
as
many
pieces
as
he
owed
pounds
that
would
have
been
a
smash
indeed
returns
the
trooper
coolly
any
way
he
had
been
young
hopeful
and
handsome
in
the
days
gone
by
and
i
am
glad
i
never
found
him
when
he
was
neither
to
lead
to
a
result
so
much
to
his
advantage
that
reason
number
one
i
hope
number
two
as
good
snarls
the
old
man
why
no
it
more
of
a
selfish
reason
if
i
had
found
him
i
must
have
gone
to
the
other
world
to
look
he
was
there
how
do
you
know
he
was
there
he
was
here
how
do
you
know
he
was
here
do
lose
your
temper
as
well
as
your
money
says
george
calmly
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
he
was
drowned
long
before
i
am
convinced
of
it
he
went
over
a
ship
side
whether
intentionally
or
accidentally
i
do
know
perhaps
your
friend
in
the
city
does
do
you
know
what
that
tune
is
mr
smallweed
he
adds
after
breaking
off
to
whistle
one
accompanied
on
the
table
with
the
empty
pipe
tune
replied
the
old
man
no
we
never
have
tunes
here
that
the
dead
march
in
saul
they
bury
soldiers
to
it
so
it
the
natural
end
of
the
subject
now
if
your
pretty
granddaughter
excuse
me
miss
will
condescend
to
take
care
of
this
pipe
for
two
months
we
shall
save
the
cost
of
one
next
time
good
evening
mr
smallweed
my
dear
friend
the
old
man
gives
him
both
his
hands
so
you
think
your
friend
in
the
city
will
be
hard
upon
me
if
i
fall
in
a
payment
says
the
trooper
looking
down
upon
him
like
a
giant
my
dear
friend
i
am
afraid
he
will
returns
the
old
man
looking
up
at
him
like
a
pygmy
george
laughs
and
with
a
glance
at
smallweed
and
a
parting
salutation
to
the
scornful
judy
strides
out
of
the
parlour
clashing
imaginary
sabres
and
other
metallic
appurtenances
as
he
goes
you
a
damned
rogue
says
the
old
gentleman
making
a
hideous
grimace
at
the
door
as
he
shuts
it
but
i
lime
you
you
dog
lime
you
after
this
amiable
remark
his
spirit
soars
into
those
enchanting
regions
of
reflection
which
its
education
and
pursuits
have
opened
to
it
and
again
he
and
smallweed
while
away
the
rosy
hours
two
unrelieved
sentinels
forgotten
as
aforesaid
by
the
black
serjeant
while
the
twain
are
faithful
to
their
post
george
strides
through
the
streets
with
a
massive
kind
of
swagger
and
a
face
it
is
eight
now
and
the
day
is
fast
drawing
in
he
stops
hard
by
waterloo
bridge
and
reads
a
playbill
decides
to
go
to
astley
theatre
being
there
is
much
delighted
with
the
horses
and
the
feats
of
strength
looks
at
the
weapons
with
a
critical
eye
disapproves
of
the
combats
as
giving
evidences
of
unskilful
swordsmanship
but
is
touched
home
by
the
sentiments
in
the
last
scene
when
the
emperor
of
tartary
gets
up
into
a
cart
and
condescends
to
bless
the
united
lovers
by
hovering
over
them
with
the
union
jack
his
eyelashes
are
moistened
with
emotion
the
theatre
over
george
comes
across
the
water
again
and
makes
his
way
to
that
curious
region
lying
about
the
haymarket
and
leicester
square
which
is
a
centre
of
attraction
to
indifferent
foreign
hotels
and
indifferent
foreigners
swordsmen
footguards
old
china
exhibitions
and
a
large
medley
of
shabbiness
and
shrinking
out
of
sight
penetrating
to
the
heart
of
this
region
he
arrives
by
a
court
and
a
long
whitewashed
passage
at
a
great
brick
building
composed
of
bare
walls
floors
and
skylights
on
the
front
of
which
if
it
can
be
said
to
have
any
front
is
painted
shooting
gallery
into
george
shooting
gallery
he
goes
and
in
it
there
are
gaslights
partly
turned
off
now
and
two
whitened
targets
for
and
archery
accommodation
and
fencing
appliances
and
all
necessaries
for
the
british
art
of
boxing
none
of
these
sports
or
exercises
being
pursued
in
george
shooting
gallery
which
is
so
devoid
of
company
that
a
little
grotesque
man
with
a
large
head
has
it
all
to
himself
and
lies
asleep
upon
the
floor
the
little
man
is
dressed
something
like
a
gunsmith
in
a
apron
and
cap
and
his
face
and
hands
are
dirty
with
gunpowder
and
begrimed
with
the
loading
of
guns
as
he
lies
in
the
light
before
a
glaring
white
target
the
black
upon
him
shines
again
not
far
off
is
the
strong
rough
primitive
table
with
a
vice
upon
it
at
which
he
has
been
working
he
is
a
little
man
with
a
face
all
crushed
together
who
appears
from
a
certain
blue
and
speckled
appearance
that
one
of
his
cheeks
presents
to
have
been
blown
up
in
the
way
of
business
at
some
odd
time
or
times
phil
says
the
trooper
in
a
quiet
voice
all
right
cries
phil
scrambling
to
his
feet
anything
been
doing
flat
as
ever
so
much
swipes
says
phil
five
dozen
rifle
and
a
dozen
pistol
as
to
aim
phil
gives
a
howl
at
the
recollection
shut
up
shop
phil
as
phil
moves
about
to
execute
this
order
it
appears
that
he
is
lame
though
able
to
move
very
quickly
on
the
speckled
side
of
his
face
he
has
no
eyebrow
and
on
the
other
side
he
has
a
bushy
black
one
which
want
of
uniformity
gives
him
a
very
singular
and
rather
sinister
appearance
everything
seems
to
have
happened
to
his
hands
that
could
possibly
take
place
consistently
with
the
retention
of
all
the
fingers
for
they

a

way
of

round

off

allegory
looks
pretty
cool
in
lincoln
inn
fields
though
the
evening
is
hot
for
both
tulkinghorn
windows
are
wide
open
and
the
room
is
lofty
gusty
and
gloomy
these
may
not
be
desirable
characteristics
when
november
comes
with
fog
and
sleet
or
january
with
ice
and
snow
but
they
have
their
merits
in
the
sultry
long
vacation
weather
they
enable
allegory
though
it
has
cheeks
like
peaches
and
knees
like
bunches
of
blossoms
and
rosy
swellings
for
calves
to
its
legs
and
muscles
to
its
arms
to
look
tolerably
cool
plenty
of
dust
comes
in
at
tulkinghorn
windows
and
plenty
more
has
generated
among
his
furniture
and
papers
it
lies
thick
everywhere
when
a
breeze
from
the
country
that
has
lost
its
way
takes
fright
and
makes
a
blind
hurry
to
rush
out
again
it
flings
as
much
dust
in
the
eyes
of
allegory
as
the
law
or
tulkinghorn
one
of
its
trustiest
representatives
may
scatter
on
occasion
in
the
eyes
of
the
laity
in
his
lowering
magazine
of
dust
the
universal
article
into
which
his
papers
and
himself
and
all
his
clients
and
all
things
of
earth
animate
and
inanimate
are
resolving
tulkinghorn
sits
at
one
of
the
open
windows
enjoying
a
bottle
of
old
port
though
a
man
close
dry
and
silent
he
can
enjoy
old
wine
with
the
best
he
has
a
priceless
bin
of
port
in
some
artful
cellar
under
the
fields
which
is
one
of
his
many
secrets
when
he
dines
alone
in
chambers
as
he
has
dined
and
has
his
bit
of
fish
and
his
steak
or
chicken
brought
in
from
the
he
descends
with
a
candle
to
the
echoing
regions
below
the
deserted
mansion
and
heralded
by
a
remote
reverberation
of
thundering
doors
comes
gravely
back
encircled
by
an
earthy
atmosphere
and
carrying
a
bottle
from
which
he
pours
a
radiant
nectar
two
score
and
ten
years
old
that
blushes
in
the
glass
to
find
itself
so
famous
and
fills
the
whole
room
with
the
fragrance
of
southern
grapes
tulkinghorn
sitting
in
the
twilight
by
the
open
window
enjoys
his
wine
as
if
it
whispered
to
him
of
its
fifty
years
of
silence
and
seclusion
it
shuts
him
up
the
closer
more
impenetrable
than
ever
he
sits
and
drinks
and
mellows
as
it
were
in
secrecy
pondering
at
that
twilight
hour
on
all
the
mysteries
he
knows
associated
with
darkening
woods
in
the
country
and
vast
blank
houses
in
town
and
perhaps
sparing
a
thought
or
two
for
himself
and
his
family
history
and
his
money
and
his
will
all
a
mystery
to
every
one
and
that
one
bachelor
friend
of
his
a
man
of
the
same
mould
and
a
lawyer
too
who
lived
the
same
kind
of
life
until
he
was
years
old
and
then
suddenly
conceiving
as
it
is
supposed
an
impression
that
it
was
too
monotonous
gave
his
gold
watch
to
his
one
summer
evening
and
walked
leisurely
home
to
the
temple
and
hanged
himself
but
tulkinghorn
is
not
alone
to
ponder
at
his
usual
length
seated
at
the
same
table
though
with
his
chair
modestly
and
uncomfortably
drawn
a
little
way
from
it
sits
a
bald
mild
shining
man
who
coughs
respectfully
behind
his
hand
when
the
lawyer
bids
him
fill
his
glass
now
snagsby
says
tulkinghorn
to
go
over
this
odd
story
again
if
you
please
sir
you
told
me
when
you
were
so
good
as
to
step
round
here
last
night
for
which
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
if
it
was
a
liberty
sir
but
i
remember
that
you
had
taken
a
sort
of
an
interest
in
that
person
and
i
thought
it
possible
that
you
might
just
wish
to
tulkinghorn
is
not
the
man
to
help
him
to
any
conclusion
or
to
admit
anything
as
to
any
possibility
concerning
himself
so
snagsby
trails
off
into
saying
with
an
awkward
cough
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
the
liberty
sir
i
am
sure
not
at
all
says
tulkinghorn
you
told
me
snagsby
that
you
put
on
your
hat
and
came
round
without
mentioning
your
intention
to
your
wife
that
was
prudent
i
think
because
it
not
a
matter
of
such
importance
that
it
requires
to
be
mentioned
well
sir
returns
snagsby
you
see
my
little
woman
is
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
inquisitive
she
inquisitive
poor
little
thing
she
liable
to
spasms
and
it
good
for
her
to
have
her
mind
employed
in
consequence
of
which
she
employs
it
i
should
say
upon
every
individual
thing
she
can
lay
hold
of
whether
it
concerns
her
or
not
especially
not
my
little
woman
has
a
very
active
mind
sir
snagsby
drinks
and
murmurs
with
an
admiring
cough
behind
his
hand
dear
me
very
fine
wine
indeed
therefore
you
kept
your
visit
to
yourself
last
night
says
tulkinghorn
and
too
yes
sir
and
too
my
little
woman
is
at
present
in
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
in
a
pious
state
or
in
what
she
considers
such
and
attends
the
evening
exertions
which
is
the
name
they
go
by
of
a
reverend
party
of
the
name
of
chadband
he
has
a
great
deal
of
eloquence
at
his
command
undoubtedly
but
i
am
not
quite
favourable
to
his
style
myself
that
neither
here
nor
there
my
little
woman
being
engaged
in
that
way
made
it
easier
for
me
to
step
round
in
a
quiet
manner
tulkinghorn
assents
fill
your
glass
snagsby
thank
you
sir
i
am
sure
returns
the
stationer
with
his
cough
of
deference
this
is
wonderfully
fine
wine
sir
it
is
a
rare
wine
now
says
tulkinghorn
it
is
fifty
years
old
is
it
indeed
sir
but
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
it
i
am
sure
it
might
be
any
age
almost
after
rendering
this
general
tribute
to
the
port
snagsby
in
his
modesty
coughs
an
apology
behind
his
hand
for
drinking
anything
so
precious
will
you
run
over
once
again
what
the
boy
said
asks
tulkinghorn
putting
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
rusty
smallclothes
and
leaning
quietly
back
in
his
chair
with
pleasure
sir
then
with
fidelity
though
with
some
prolixity
the
repeats
jo
statement
made
to
the
assembled
guests
at
his
house
on
coming
to
the
end
of
his
narrative
he
gives
a
great
start
and
breaks
off
with
dear
me
sir
i
was
aware
there
was
any
other
gentleman
present
snagsby
is
dismayed
to
see
standing
with
an
attentive
face
between
himself
and
the
lawyer
at
a
little
distance
from
the
table
a
person
with
a
hat
and
stick
in
his
hand
who
was
not
there
when
he
himself
came
in
and
has
not
since
entered
by
the
door
or
by
either
of
the
windows
there
is
a
press
in
the
room
but
its
hinges
have
not
creaked
nor
has
a
step
been
audible
upon
the
floor
yet
this
third
person
stands
there
with
his
attentive
face
and
his
hat
and
stick
in
his
hands
and
his
hands
behind
him
a
composed
and
quiet
listener
he
is
a
stoutly
built
man
in
black
of
about
the
except
that
he
looks
at
snagsby
as
if
he
were
going
to
take
his
portrait
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
him
at
first
sight
but
his
ghostly
manner
of
appearing
do
mind
this
gentleman
says
tulkinghorn
in
his
quiet
way
this
is
only
mr
bucket
oh
indeed
sir
returns
the
stationer
expressing
by
a
cough
that
he
is
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
who
bucket
may
be
i
wanted
him
to
hear
this
story
says
the
lawyer
because
i
have
half
a
mind
for
a
reason
to
know
more
of
it
and
he
is
very
intelligent
in
such
things
what
do
you
say
to
this
bucket
it
very
plain
sir
since
our
people
have
moved
this
boy
on
and
he
not
to
be
found
on
his
old
lay
if
snagsby
do
object
to
go
down
with
me
to
and
point
him
out
we
can
have
him
here
in
less
than
a
couple
of
hours
time
i
can
do
it
without
snagsby
of
course
but
this
is
the
shortest
way
bucket
is
a
detective
officer
snagsby
says
the
lawyer
in
explanation
is
he
indeed
sir
says
snagsby
with
a
strong
tendency
in
his
clump
of
hair
to
stand
on
end
and
if
you
have
no
real
objection
to
accompany
bucket
to
the
place
in
question
pursues
the
lawyer
i
shall
feel
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
do
so
in
a
moment
hesitation
on
the
part
of
snagsby
bucket
dips
down
to
the
bottom
of
his
mind
do
you
be
afraid
of
hurting
the
boy
he
says
you
wo
do
that
it
all
right
as
far
as
the
boy
concerned
we
shall
only
bring
him
here
to
ask
him
a
question
or
so
i
want
to
put
to
him
and
he
be
paid
for
his
trouble
and
sent
away
again
it
be
a
good
job
for
him
i
promise
you
as
a
man
that
you
shall
see
the
boy
sent
away
all
right
do
you
be
afraid
of
hurting
him
you
a
going
to
do
that
very
well
mr
tulkinghorn
cries
snagsby
cheerfully
and
reassured
since
that
the
case
yes
and
lookee
here
snagsby
resumes
bucket
taking
him
aside
by
the
arm
tapping
him
familiarly
on
the
breast
and
speaking
in
a
confidential
tone
you
a
man
of
the
world
you
know
and
a
man
of
business
and
a
man
of
sense
that
what
you
are
i
am
sure
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
good
opinion
returns
the
stationer
with
his
cough
of
modesty
but
that
what
you
are
you
know
says
bucket
now
it
a
necessary
to
say
to
a
man
like
you
engaged
in
your
business
which
is
a
business
of
trust
and
requires
a
person
to
be
wide
awake
and
have
his
senses
about
him
and
his
head
screwed
on
tight
i
had
an
uncle
in
your
business
once
it
a
necessary
to
say
to
a
man
like
you
that
it
the
best
and
wisest
way
to
keep
little
matters
like
this
quiet
do
you
see
quiet
certainly
certainly
returns
the
other
i
do
mind
telling
you
says
bucket
with
an
engaging
appearance
of
frankness
that
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it
there
seems
to
be
a
doubt
whether
this
dead
person
was
entitled
to
a
little
property
and
whether
this
female
has
been
up
to
some
games
respecting
that
property
do
you
see
oh
says
snagsby
but
not
appearing
to
see
quite
distinctly
now
what
you
want
pursues
bucket
again
tapping
snagsby
on
the
breast
in
a
comfortable
and
soothing
manner
is
that
every
person
should
have
their
rights
according
to
justice
that
what
you
want
to
be
sure
returns
snagsby
with
a
nod
on
account
of
which
and
at
the
same
time
to
oblige
a
do
you
call
it
in
your
business
customer
or
client
i
forget
how
my
uncle
used
to
call
it
why
i
generally
say
customer
myself
replies
snagsby
you
right
returns
bucket
shaking
hands
with
him
quite
on
account
of
which
and
at
the
same
time
to
oblige
a
real
good
customer
you
mean
to
go
down
with
me
in
confidence
to
and
to
keep
the
whole
thing
quiet
ever
afterwards
and
never
mention
it
to
any
one
that
about
your
intentions
if
i
understand
you
you
are
right
sir
you
are
right
says
snagsby
then
here
your
hat
returns
his
new
friend
quite
as
intimate
with
it
as
if
he
had
made
it
and
if
you
ready
i
am
they
leave
tulkinghorn
without
a
ruffle
on
the
surface
of
his
unfathomable
depths
drinking
his
old
wine
and
go
down
into
the
streets
you
do
happen
to
know
a
very
good
sort
of
person
of
the
name
of
gridley
do
you
says
bucket
in
friendly
converse
as
they
descend
the
stairs
no
says
snagsby
considering
i
do
know
anybody
of
that
name
why
nothing
particular
says
bucket
only
having
allowed
his
temper
to
get
a
little
the
better
of
him
and
having
been
threatening
some
respectable
people
he
is
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
a
warrant
i
have
got
against
him
which
it
a
pity
that
a
man
of
sense
should
do
as
they
walk
along
snagsby
observes
as
a
novelty
that
however
quick
their
pace
may
be
his
companion
still
seems
in
some
undefinable
manner
to
lurk
and
lounge
also
that
whenever
he
is
going
to
turn
to
the
right
or
left
he
pretends
to
have
a
fixed
purpose
in
his
mind
of
going
straight
ahead
and
wheels
off
sharply
at
the
very
last
moment
now
and
then
when
they
pass
a
on
his
beat
snagsby
notices
that
both
the
constable
and
his
guide
fall
into
a
deep
abstraction
as
they
come
towards
each
other
and
appear
entirely
to
overlook
each
other
and
to
gaze
into
space
in
a
few
instances
bucket
coming
behind
some
young
man
with
a
shining
hat
on
and
his
sleek
hair
twisted
into
one
flat
curl
on
each
side
of
his
head
almost
without
glancing
at
him
touches
him
with
his
stick
upon
which
the
young
man
looking
round
instantly
evaporates
for
the
most
part
bucket
notices
things
in
general
with
a
face
as
unchanging
as
the
great
mourning
ring
on
his
little
finger
or
the
brooch
composed
of
not
much
diamond
and
a
good
deal
of
setting
which
he
wears
in
his
shirt
when
they
come
at
last
to
bucket
stops
for
a
moment
at
the
corner
and
takes
a
lighted
from
the
constable
on
duty
there
who
then
accompanies
him
with
his
own
particular
at
his
waist
between
his
two
conductors
snagsby
passes
along
the
middle
of
a
villainous
street
undrained
unventilated
deep
in
black
mud
and
corrupt
water
though
the
roads
are
dry
elsewhere
and
reeking
with
such
smells
and
sights
that
he
who
has
lived
in
london
all
his
life
can
scarce
believe
his
senses
branching
from
this
street
and
its
heaps
of
ruins
are
other
streets
and
courts
so
infamous
that
snagsby
sickens
in
body
and
mind
and
feels
as
if
he
were
going
every
moment
deeper
down
into
the
infernal
gulf
draw
off
a
bit
here
snagsby
says
bucket
as
a
kind
of
shabby
palanquin
is
borne
towards
them
surrounded
by
a
noisy
crowd
the
fever
coming
up
the
street
as
the
unseen
wretch
goes
by
the
crowd
leaving
that
object
of
attraction
hovers
round
the
three
visitors
like
a
dream
of
horrible
faces
and
fades
away
up
alleys
and
into
ruins
and
behind
walls
and
with
occasional
cries
and
shrill
whistles
of
warning
thenceforth
flits
about
them
until
they
leave
the
place
are
those
the
darby
bucket
coolly
asks
as
he
turns
his
on
a
line
of
stinking
ruins
darby
replies
that
all
them
are
and
further
that
in
all
for
months
and
months
the
people
have
been
down
by
dozens
and
have
been
carried
out
dead
and
dying
like
sheep
with
the
rot
bucket
observing
to
snagsby
as
they
go
on
again
that
he
looks
a
little
poorly
snagsby
answers
that
he
feels
as
if
he
could
breathe
the
dreadful
air
there
is
inquiry
made
at
various
houses
for
a
boy
named
jo
as
few
people
are
known
in
by
any
christian
sign
there
is
much
reference
to
snagsby
whether
he
means
carrots
or
the
colonel
or
gallows
or
young
chisel
or
terrier
tip
or
lanky
or
the
brick
snagsby
describes
over
and
over
again
there
are
conflicting
opinions
respecting
the
original
of
his
picture
some
think
it
must
be
carrots
some
say
the
brick
the
colonel
is
produced
but
is
not
at
all
near
the
thing
whenever
snagsby
and
his
conductors
are
stationary
the
crowd
flows
round
and
from
its
squalid
depths
obsequious
advice
heaves
up
to
bucket
whenever
they
move
and
the
angry
glare
it
fades
away
and
flits
about
them
up
the
alleys
and
in
the
ruins
and
behind
the
walls
as
before
at
last
there
is
a
lair
found
out
where
toughy
or
the
tough
subject
lays
him
down
at
night
and
it
is
thought
that
the
tough
subject
may
be
jo
comparison
of
notes
between
snagsby
and
the
proprietress
of
the
house
a
drunken
face
tied
up
in
a
black
bundle
and
flaring
out
of
a
heap
of
rags
on
the
floor
of
a
which
is
her
private
apartment
leads
to
the
establishment
of
this
conclusion
toughy
has
gone
to
the
doctor
to
get
a
bottle
of
stuff
for
a
sick
woman
but
will
be
here
anon
and
who
have
we
got
here
says
bucket
opening
another
door
and
glaring
in
with
his
two
drunken
men
eh
and
two
women
the
men
are
sound
enough
turning
back
each
sleeper
arm
from
his
face
to
look
at
him
are
these
your
good
men
my
dears
yes
sir
returns
one
of
the
women
they
are
our
husbands
brickmakers
eh
yes
sir
what
are
you
doing
here
you
do
belong
to
london
no
sir
we
belong
to
hertfordshire
whereabouts
in
hertfordshire
saint
albans
come
up
on
the
tramp
we
walked
up
yesterday
there
no
work
down
with
us
at
present
but
we
have
done
no
good
by
coming
here
and
shall
do
none
i
expect
that
not
the
way
to
do
much
good
says
bucket
turning
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
unconscious
figures
on
the
ground
it
a
indeed
replies
the
woman
with
a
sigh
jenny
and
me
knows
it
full
well
the
room
though
two
or
three
feet
higher
than
the
door
is
so
low
that
the
head
of
the
tallest
of
the
visitors
would
touch
the
blackened
ceiling
if
he
stood
upright
it
is
offensive
to
every
sense
even
the
gross
candle
burns
pale
and
sickly
in
the
polluted
air
there
are
a
couple
of
benches
and
a
higher
bench
by
way
of
table
the
men
lie
asleep
where
they
stumbled
down
but
the
women
sit
by
the
candle
lying
in
the
arms
of
the
woman
who
has
spoken
is
a
very
young
child
why
what
age
do
you
call
that
little
creature
says
bucket
it
looks
as
if
it
was
born
yesterday
he
is
not
at
all
rough
about
it
and
as
he
turns
his
light
gently
on
the
infant
snagsby
is
strangely
reminded
of
another
infant
encircled
with
light
that
he
has
seen
in
pictures
he
is
not
three
weeks
old
yet
sir
says
the
woman
is
he
your
child
mine
the
other
woman
who
was
bending
over
it
when
they
came
in
stoops
down
again
and
kisses
it
as
it
lies
asleep
you
seem
as
fond
of
it
as
if
you
were
the
mother
yourself
says
bucket
i
was
the
mother
of
one
like
it
master
and
it
died
ah
jenny
jenny
says
the
other
woman
to
her
better
so
much
better
to
think
of
dead
than
alive
jenny
much
better
why
you
a
such
an
unnatural
woman
i
hope
returns
bucket
sternly
as
to
wish
your
own
child
dead
god
knows
you
are
right
master
she
returns
i
am
not
i
stand
between
it
and
death
with
my
own
life
if
i
could
as
true
as
any
pretty
lady
then
do
talk
in
that
wrong
manner
says
bucket
mollified
again
why
do
you
do
it
it
brought
into
my
head
master
returns
the
woman
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
when
i
look
down
at
the
child
lying
so
if
it
was
never
to
wake
no
more
you
think
me
mad
i
should
take
on
so
i
know
that
very
well
i
was
with
jenny
when
she
lost
hers
war
i
jenny
and
i
know
how
she
grieved
but
look
around
you
at
this
place
look
at
them
glancing
at
the
sleepers
on
the
ground
look
at
the
boy
you
waiting
for
who
gone
out
to
do
me
a
good
turn
think
of
the
children
that
your
business
lays
with
often
and
often
and
that
you
see
grow
up
well
well
says
bucket
you
train
him
respectable
and
be
a
comfort
to
you
and
look
after
you
in
your
old
age
you
know
i
mean
to
try
hard
she
answers
wiping
her
eyes
but
i
have
been
being
and
not
well
with
the
ague
of
all
the
many
things
that
come
in
his
way
my
master
will
be
against
it
and
he
be
beat
and
see
me
beat
and
made
to
fear
his
home
and
perhaps
to
stray
wild
if
i
work
for
him
ever
so
much
and
ever
so
hard
there
no
one
to
help
me
and
if
he
should
be
turned
bad
of
all
i
could
do
and
the
time
should
come
when
i
should
sit
by
him
in
his
sleep
made
hard
and
changed
a
it
likely
i
should
think
of
him
as
he
lies
in
my
lap
now
and
wish
he
had
died
as
jenny
child
died
there
there
says
jenny
liz
you
tired
and
let
me
take
him
in
doing
so
she
displaces
the
mother
dress
but
quickly
readjusts
it
over
the
wounded
and
bruised
bosom
where
the
baby
has
been
lying
it
my
dead
child
says
jenny
walking
up
and
down
as
she
nurses
that
makes
me
love
this
child
so
dear
and
it
my
dead
child
that
makes
her
love
it
so
dear
too
as
even
to
think
of
its
being
taken
away
from
her
now
while
she
thinks
that
i
think
what
fortune
would
i
give
to
have
my
darling
back
but
we
mean
the
same
thing
if
we
knew
how
to
say
it
us
two
mothers
does
in
our
poor
hearts
as
snagsby
blows
his
nose
and
coughs
his
cough
of
sympathy
a
step
is
heard
without
bucket
throws
his
light
into
the
doorway
and
says
to
snagsby
now
what
do
you
say
to
toughy
will
he
do
that
jo
says
snagsby
jo
stands
amazed
in
the
disk
of
light
like
a
ragged
figure
in
a
trembling
to
think
that
he
has
offended
against
the
law
in
not
having
moved
on
far
enough
snagsby
however
giving
him
the
consolatory
assurance
it
only
a
job
you
will
be
paid
for
jo
he
recovers
and
on
being
taken
outside
by
bucket
for
a
little
private
confabulation
tells
his
tale
satisfactorily
though
out
of
breath
i
have
squared
it
with
the
lad
says
bucket
returning
and
it
all
right
now
snagsby
we
ready
for
you
first
jo
has
to
complete
his
errand
of
good
nature
by
handing
over
the
physic
he
has
been
to
get
which
he
delivers
with
the
laconic
verbal
direction
that
it
to
be
all
took
secondly
snagsby
has
to
lay
upon
the
table
half
a
crown
his
usual
panacea
for
an
immense
variety
of
afflictions
thirdly
bucket
has
to
take
jo
by
the
arm
a
little
above
the
elbow
and
walk
him
on
before
him
without
which
observance
neither
the
tough
subject
nor
any
other
subject
could
be
professionally
conducted
to
lincoln
inn
fields
these
arrangements
completed
they
give
the
women
good
night
and
come
out
once
more
into
black
and
foul
by
the
noisome
ways
through
which
they
descended
into
that
pit
they
gradually
emerge
from
it
the
crowd
flitting
and
whistling
and
skulking
about
them
until
they
come
to
the
verge
where
restoration
of
the
is
made
to
darby
here
the
crowd
like
a
concourse
of
imprisoned
demons
turns
back
yelling
and
is
seen
no
more
through
the
clearer
and
fresher
streets
never
so
clear
and
fresh
to
snagsby
mind
as
now
they
walk
and
ride
until
they
come
to
tulkinghorn
gate
as
they
ascend
the
dim
stairs
tulkinghorn
chambers
being
on
the
first
floor
bucket
mentions
that
he
has
the
key
of
the
outer
door
in
his
pocket
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
ring
for
a
man
so
expert
in
most
things
of
that
kind
bucket
takes
time
to
open
the
door
and
makes
some
noise
too
it
may
be
that
he
sounds
a
note
of
preparation
howbeit
they
come
at
last
into
the
hall
where
a
lamp
is
burning
and
so
into
tulkinghorn
usual
room
the
room
where
he
drank
his
old
wine
he
is
not
there
but
his
two
candlesticks
are
and
the
room
is
tolerably
light
bucket
still
having
his
professional
hold
of
jo
and
appearing
to
snagsby
to
possess
an
unlimited
number
of
eyes
makes
a
little
way
into
this
room
when
jo
starts
and
stops
what
the
matter
says
bucket
in
a
whisper
there
she
is
cries
jo
who
the
lady
a
female
figure
closely
veiled
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
room
where
the
light
falls
upon
it
it
is
quite
still
and
silent
the
front
of
the
figure
is
towards
them
but
it
takes
no
notice
of
their
entrance
and
remains
like
a
statue
now
tell
me
says
bucket
aloud
how
you
know
that
to
be
the
lady
i
know
the
wale
replies
jo
staring
and
the
bonnet
and
the
gownd
be
quite
sure
of
what
you
say
tough
returns
bucket
narrowly
observant
of
him
look
again
i
am
as
hard
as
ever
i
can
look
says
jo
with
starting
eyes
and
that
there
the
wale
the
bonnet
and
the
gownd
what
about
those
rings
you
told
me
of
asks
bucket
all
over
here
says
jo
rubbing
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
on
the
knuckles
of
his
right
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
figure
the
figure
removes
the
glove
and
shows
the
hand
now
what
do
you
say
to
that
asks
bucket
jo
shakes
his
head
not
rings
a
bit
like
them
not
a
hand
like
that
what
are
you
talking
of
says
bucket
evidently
pleased
though
and
well
pleased
too
hand
was
a
deal
whiter
a
deal
delicater
and
a
deal
smaller
returns
jo
why
you
tell
me
i
my
own
mother
next
says
bucket
do
you
recollect
the
lady
voice
i
think
i
does
says
jo
the
figure
speaks
was
it
at
all
like
this
i
will
speak
as
long
as
you
like
if
you
are
not
sure
was
it
this
voice
or
at
all
like
this
voice
jo
looks
aghast
at
bucket
not
a
bit
then
what
retorts
that
worthy
pointing
to
the
figure
did
you
say
it
was
the
lady
for
cos
says
jo
with
a
perplexed
stare
but
without
being
at
all
shaken
in
his
certainty
cos
that
there
the
wale
the
bonnet
and
the
gownd
it
is
her
and
it
a
her
it
a
her
hand
nor
yet
her
rings
nor
yet
her
woice
but
that
there
the
wale
the
bonnet
and
the
gownd
and
they
wore
the
same
way
wot
she
wore
and
her
height
wot
she
wos
and
she
giv
me
a
and
hooked
it
well
says
bucket
slightly
we
have
got
much
good
out
of
you
but
however
here
five
shillings
for
you
take
care
how
you
spend
it
and
do
get
yourself
into
trouble
bucket
stealthily
tells
the
coins
from
one
hand
into
the
other
like
counters
which
is
a
way
he
has
his
principal
use
of
them
being
in
these
games
of
skill
and
then
puts
them
in
a
little
pile
into
the
boy
hand
and
takes
him
out
to
the
door
leaving
snagsby
not
by
any
means
comfortable
under
these
mysterious
circumstances
alone
with
the
veiled
figure
but
on
tulkinghorn
coming
into
the
room
the
veil
is
raised
and
a
sufficiently
frenchwoman
is
revealed
though
her
expression
is
something
of
the
intensest
thank
you
mademoiselle
hortense
says
tulkinghorn
with
his
usual
equanimity
i
will
give
you
no
further
trouble
about
this
little
wager
you
will
do
me
the
kindness
to
remember
sir
that
i
am
not
at
present
placed
says
mademoiselle
certainly
certainly
and
to
confer
upon
me
the
favour
of
your
distinguished
recommendation
by
all
means
mademoiselle
hortense
a
word
from
tulkinghorn
is
so
powerful
it
shall
not
be
wanting
mademoiselle
receive
the
assurance
of
my
devoted
gratitude
dear
sir
good
night
mademoiselle
goes
out
with
an
air
of
native
gentility
and
bucket
to
whom
it
is
on
an
emergency
as
natural
to
be
groom
of
the
ceremonies
as
it
is
to
be
anything
else
shows
her
downstairs
not
without
gallantry
well
bucket
quoth
tulkinghorn
on
his
return
it
all
squared
you
see
as
i
squared
it
myself
sir
there
a
a
doubt
that
it
was
the
other
one
with
this
one
dress
on
the
boy
was
exact
respecting
colours
and
everything
snagsby
i
promised
you
as
a
man
that
he
should
be
sent
away
all
right
do
say
it
done
you
have
kept
your
word
sir
returns
the
stationer
and
if
i
can
be
of
no
further
use
tulkinghorn
i
think
as
my
little
woman
will
be
getting
anxious
thank
you
snagsby
no
further
use
says
tulkinghorn
i
am
quite
indebted
to
you
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
already
not
at
all
sir
i
wish
you
good
night
you
see
snagsby
says
bucket
accompanying
him
to
the
door
and
shaking
hands
with
him
over
and
over
again
what
i
like
in
you
is
that
you
a
man
it
of
no
use
pumping
that
what
you
are
when
you
know
you
have
done
a
right
thing
you
put
it
away
and
done
with
and
gone
and
there
an
end
of
it
that
what
you
do
that
is
certainly
what
i
endeavour
to
do
sir
returns
snagsby
no
you
do
do
yourself
justice
it
a
what
you
endeavour
to
do
says
bucket
shaking
hands
with
him
and
blessing
him
in
the
tenderest
manner
it
what
you
do
that
what
i
estimate
in
a
man
in
your
way
of
business
snagsby
makes
a
suitable
response
and
goes
homeward
so
confused
by
the
events
of
the
evening
that
he
is
doubtful
of
his
being
awake
and
out
doubtful
of
the
reality
of
the
streets
through
which
he
goes
doubtful
of
the
reality
of
the
moon
that
shines
above
him
he
is
presently
reassured
on
these
subjects
by
the
unchallengeable
reality
of
snagsby
sitting
up
with
her
head
in
a
perfect
beehive
of
and
who
has
dispatched
guster
to
the
with
official
intelligence
of
her
husband
being
made
away
with
and
who
within
the
last
two
hours
has
passed
through
every
stage
of
swooning
with
the
greatest
decorum
but
as
the
little
woman
feelingly
says
many
thanks
she
gets
for
it
chapter

narrative
we
came
home
from
boythorn
after
six
pleasant
weeks
we
were
often
in
the
park
and
in
the
woods
and
seldom
passed
the
lodge
where
we
had
taken
shelter
without
looking
in
to
speak
to
the
wife
but
we
saw
no
more
of
lady
dedlock
except
at
church
on
sundays
there
was
company
at
chesney
wold
and
although
several
beautiful
faces
surrounded
her
her
face
retained
the
same
influence
on
me
as
at
first
i
do
not
quite
know
even
now
whether
it
was
painful
or
pleasurable
whether
it
drew
me
towards
her
or
made
me
shrink
from
her
i
think
i
admired
her
with
a
kind
of
fear
and
i
know
that
in
her
presence
my
thoughts
always
wandered
back
as
they
had
done
at
first
to
that
old
time
of
my
life
i
had
a
fancy
on
more
than
one
of
these
sundays
that
what
this
lady
so
curiously
was
to
me
i
was
to
her
i
mean
that
i
disturbed
her
thoughts
as
she
influenced
mine
though
in
some
different
way
but
when
i
stole
a
glance
at
her
and
saw
her
so
composed
and
distant
and
unapproachable
i
felt
this
to
be
a
foolish
weakness
indeed
i
felt
the
whole
state
of
my
mind
in
reference
to
her
to
be
weak
and
unreasonable
and
i
remonstrated
with
myself
about
it
as
much
as
i
could
one
incident
that
occurred
before
we
quitted
boythorn
house
i
had
better
mention
in
this
place
i
was
walking
in
the
garden
with
ada
when
i
was
told
that
some
one
wished
to
see
me
going
into
the
where
this
person
was
waiting
i
found
it
to
be
the
french
maid
who
had
cast
off
her
shoes
and
walked
through
the
wet
grass
on
the
day
when
it
thundered
and
lightened
mademoiselle
she
began
looking
fixedly
at
me
with
her
eyes
though
otherwise
presenting
an
agreeable
appearance
and
speaking
neither
with
boldness
nor
servility
i
have
taken
a
great
liberty
in
coming
here
but
you
know
how
to
excuse
it
being
so
amiable
mademoiselle
no
excuse
is
necessary
i
returned
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
that
is
my
desire
mademoiselle
a
thousand
thanks
for
the
permission
i
have
your
leave
to
speak
is
it
not
she
said
in
a
quick
natural
way
certainly
said
i
mademoiselle
you
are
so
amiable
listen
then
if
you
please
i
have
left
my
lady
we
could
not
agree
my
lady
is
so
high
so
very
high
pardon
mademoiselle
you
are
right
her
quickness
anticipated
what
i
might
have
said
presently
but
as
yet
had
only
thought
it
is
not
for
me
to
come
here
to
complain
of
my
lady
but
i
say
she
is
so
high
so
very
high
i
will
not
say
a
word
more
all
the
world
knows
that
go
on
if
you
please
said
i
assuredly
mademoiselle
i
am
thankful
for
your
politeness
mademoiselle
i
have
an
inexpressible
desire
to
find
service
with
a
young
lady
who
is
good
accomplished
beautiful
you
are
good
accomplished
and
beautiful
as
an
angel
ah
could
i
have
the
honour
of
being
your
domestic
i
am
sorry
i
began
do
not
dismiss
me
so
soon
mademoiselle
she
said
with
an
involuntary
contraction
of
her
fine
black
eyebrows
let
me
hope
a
moment
mademoiselle
i
know
this
service
would
be
more
retired
than
that
which
i
have
quitted
well
i
wish
that
i
know
this
service
would
be
less
distinguished
than
that
which
i
have
quitted
well
i
wish
that
i
know
that
i
should
win
less
as
to
wages
here
good
i
am
content
i
assure
you
said
i
quite
embarrassed
by
the
mere
idea
of
having
such
an
attendant
that
i
keep
no
maid
ah
mademoiselle
but
why
not
why
not
when
you
can
have
one
so
devoted
to
you
who
would
be
enchanted
to
serve
you
who
would
be
so
true
so
zealous
and
so
faithful
every
day
mademoiselle
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
to
serve
you
do
not
speak
of
money
at
present
take
me
as
i
am
for
nothing
she
was
so
singularly
earnest
that
i
drew
back
almost
afraid
of
her
without
appearing
to
notice
it
in
her
ardour
she
still
pressed
herself
upon
me
speaking
in
a
rapid
subdued
voice
though
always
with
a
certain
grace
and
propriety
mademoiselle
i
come
from
the
south
country
where
we
are
quick
and
where
we
like
and
dislike
very
strong
my
lady
was
too
high
for
me
i
was
too
high
for
her
it
is
done
past
finished
receive
me
as
your
domestic
and
i
will
serve
you
well
i
will
do
more
for
you
than
you
figure
to
yourself
now
chut
mademoiselle
i
will
no
matter
i
will
do
my
utmost
possible
in
all
things
if
you
accept
my
service
you
will
not
repent
it
mademoiselle
you
will
not
repent
it
and
i
will
serve
you
well
you
do
know
how
well
there
was
a
lowering
energy
in
her
face
as
she
stood
looking
at
me
while
i
explained
the
impossibility
of
my
engaging
her
without
thinking
it
necessary
to
say
how
very
little
i
desired
to
do
so
which
seemed
to
bring
visibly
before
me
some
woman
from
the
streets
of
paris
in
the
reign
of
terror
she
heard
me
out
without
interruption
and
then
said
with
her
pretty
accent
and
in
her
mildest
voice
hey
mademoiselle
i
have
received
my
answer
i
am
sorry
of
it
but
i
must
go
elsewhere
and
seek
what
i
have
not
found
here
will
you
graciously
let
me
kiss
your
hand
she
looked
at
me
more
intently
as
she
took
it
and
seemed
to
take
note
with
her
momentary
touch
of
every
vein
in
it
i
fear
i
surprised
you
mademoiselle
on
the
day
of
the
storm
she
said
with
a
parting
curtsy
i
confessed
that
she
had
surprised
us
all
i
took
an
oath
mademoiselle
she
said
smiling
and
i
wanted
to
stamp
it
on
my
mind
so
that
i
might
keep
it
faithfully
and
i
will
adieu
mademoiselle
so
ended
our
conference
which
i
was
very
glad
to
bring
to
a
close
i
supposed
she
went
away
from
the
village
for
i
saw
her
no
more
and
nothing
else
occurred
to
disturb
our
tranquil
summer
pleasures
until
six
weeks
were
out
and
we
returned
home
as
i
began
just
now
by
saying
at
that
time
and
for
a
good
many
weeks
after
that
time
richard
was
constant
in
his
visits
besides
coming
every
saturday
or
sunday
and
remaining
with
us
until
monday
morning
he
sometimes
rode
out
on
horseback
unexpectedly
and
passed
the
evening
with
us
and
rode
back
again
early
next
day
he
was
as
vivacious
as
ever
and
told
us
he
was
very
industrious
but
i
was
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
him
it
appeared
to
me
that
his
industry
was
all
misdirected
i
could
not
find
that
it
led
to
anything
but
the
formation
of
delusive
hopes
in
connexion
with
the
suit
already
the
pernicious
cause
of
so
much
sorrow
and
ruin
he
had
got
at
the
core
of
that
mystery
now
he
told
us
and
nothing
could
be
plainer
than
that
the
will
under
which
he
and
ada
were
to
take
i
do
know
how
many
thousands
of
pounds
must
be
finally
established
if
there
were
any
sense
or
justice
in
the
court
of
chancery
but
oh
what
a
great
if
that
sounded
in
my
ears
and
that
this
happy
conclusion
could
not
be
much
longer
delayed
he
proved
this
to
himself
by
all
the
weary
arguments
on
that
side
he
had
read
and
every
one
of
them
sunk
him
deeper
in
the
infatuation
he
had
even
begun
to
haunt
the
court
he
told
us
how
he
saw
miss
flite
there
daily
how
they
talked
together
and
how
he
did
her
little
kindnesses
and
how
while
he
laughed
at
her
he
pitied
her
from
his
heart
but
he
never
thought
never
my
poor
dear
sanguine
richard
capable
of
so
much
happiness
then
and
with
such
better
things
before
him
what
a
fatal
link
was
riveting
between
his
fresh
youth
and
her
faded
age
between
his
free
hopes
and
her
caged
birds
and
her
hungry
garret
and
her
wandering
mind
ada
loved
him
too
well
to
mistrust
him
much
in
anything
he
said
or
did
and
my
guardian
though
he
frequently
complained
of
the
east
wind
and
read
more
than
usual
in
the
growlery
preserved
a
strict
silence
on
the
subject
so
i
thought
one
day
when
i
went
to
london
to
meet
caddy
jellyby
at
her
solicitation
i
would
ask
richard
to
be
in
waiting
for
me
at
the
that
we
might
have
a
little
talk
together
i
found
him
there
when
i
arrived
and
we
walked
away
arm
in
arm
well
richard
said
i
as
soon
as
i
could
begin
to
be
grave
with
him
are
you
beginning
to
feel
more
settled
now
oh
yes
my
dear
returned
richard
i
all
right
enough
but
settled
said
i
how
do
you
mean
settled
returned
richard
with
his
gay
laugh
settled
in
the
law
said
i
oh
aye
replied
richard
i
all
right
enough
you
said
that
before
my
dear
richard
and
you
do
think
it
an
answer
eh
well
perhaps
it
not
settled
you
mean
do
i
feel
as
if
i
were
settling
down
yes
why
no
i
ca
say
i
am
settling
down
said
richard
strongly
emphasizing
down
as
if
that
expressed
the
difficulty
because
one
ca
settle
down
while
this
business
remains
in
such
an
unsettled
state
when
i
say
this
business
of
course
i
mean
the
forbidden
subject
do
you
think
it
will
ever
be
in
a
settled
state
said
i
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
answered
richard
we
walked
a
little
way
without
speaking
and
presently
richard
addressed
me
in
his
frankest
and
most
feeling
manner
thus
my
dear
esther
i
understand
you
and
i
wish
to
heaven
i
were
a
more
constant
sort
of
fellow
i
do
mean
constant
to
ada
for
i
love
her
dearly
better
and
better
every
day
but
constant
to
myself
somehow
i
mean
something
that
i
ca
very
well
express
but
make
it
out
if
i
were
a
more
constant
sort
of
fellow
i
should
have
held
on
either
to
badger
or
to
kenge
and
carboy
like
grim
death
and
should
have
begun
to
be
steady
and
systematic
by
this
time
and
should
be
in
debt
and
are
you
in
debt
richard
yes
said
richard
i
am
a
little
so
my
dear
also
i
have
taken
rather
too
much
to
billiards
and
that
sort
of
thing
now
the
out
you
despise
me
esther
do
you
you
know
i
do
said
i
you
are
kinder
to
me
than
i
often
am
to
myself
he
returned
my
dear
esther
i
am
a
very
unfortunate
dog
not
to
be
more
settled
but
how
can
i
be
more
settled
if
you
lived
in
an
unfinished
house
you
could
settle
down
in
it
if
you
were
condemned
to
leave
everything
you
undertook
unfinished
you
would
find
it
hard
to
apply
yourself
to
anything
and
yet
that
my
unhappy
case
i
was
born
into
this
unfinished
contention
with
all
its
chances
and
changes
and
it
began
to
unsettle
me
before
i
quite
knew
the
difference
between
a
suit
at
law
and
a
suit
of
clothes
and
it
has
gone
on
unsettling
me
ever
since
and
here
i
am
now
conscious
sometimes
that
i
am
but
a
worthless
fellow
to
love
my
confiding
cousin
ada
we
were
in
a
solitary
place
and
he
put
his
hands
before
his
eyes
and
sobbed
as
he
said
the
words
oh
richard
said
i
do
not
be
so
moved
you
have
a
noble
nature
and
ada
love
may
make
you
worthier
every
day
i
know
my
dear
he
replied
pressing
my
arm
i
know
all
that
you
must
mind
my
being
a
little
soft
now
for
i
have
had
all
this
upon
my
mind
for
a
long
time
and
have
often
meant
to
speak
to
you
and
have
sometimes
wanted
opportunity
and
sometimes
courage
i
know
what
the
thought
of
ada
ought
to
do
for
me
but
it
does
do
it
i
am
too
unsettled
even
for
that
i
love
her
most
devotedly
and
yet
i
do
her
wrong
in
doing
myself
wrong
every
day
and
hour
but
it
ca
last
for
ever
we
shall
come
on
for
a
final
hearing
and
get
judgment
in
our
favour
and
then
you
and
ada
shall
see
what
i
can
really
be
it
had
given
me
a
pang
to
hear
him
sob
and
see
the
tears
start
out
between
his
fingers
but
that
was
infinitely
less
affecting
to
me
than
the
hopeful
animation
with
which
he
said
these
words
i
have
looked
well
into
the
papers
esther
i
have
been
deep
in
them
for
months
he
continued
recovering
his
cheerfulness
in
a
moment
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
we
shall
come
out
triumphant
as
to
years
of
delay
there
has
been
no
want
of
them
heaven
knows
and
there
is
the
greater
probability
of
our
bringing
the
matter
to
a
speedy
close
in
fact
it
on
the
paper
now
it
will
be
all
right
at
last
and
then
you
shall
see
recalling
how
he
had
just
now
placed
kenge
and
carboy
in
the
same
category
with
badger
i
asked
him
when
he
intended
to
be
articled
in
lincoln
inn
there
again
i
think
not
at
all
esther
he
returned
with
an
effort
i
fancy
i
have
had
enough
of
it
having
worked
at
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
like
a
galley
slave
i
have
slaked
my
thirst
for
the
law
and
satisfied
myself
that
i
should
like
it
besides
i
find
it
unsettles
me
more
and
more
to
be
so
constantly
upon
the
scene
of
action
so
what
continued
richard
confident
again
by
this
time
do
i
naturally
turn
my
thoughts
to
i
ca
imagine
said
i
do
look
so
serious
returned
richard
because
it
the
best
thing
i
can
do
my
dear
esther
i
am
certain
it
not
as
if
i
wanted
a
profession
for
life
these
proceedings
will
come
to
a
termination
and
then
i
am
provided
for
no
i
look
upon
it
as
a
pursuit
which
is
in
its
nature
more
or
less
unsettled
and
therefore
suited
to
my
temporary
condition
i
may
say
precisely
suited
what
is
it
that
i
naturally
turn
my
thoughts
to
i
looked
at
him
and
shook
my
head
what
said
richard
in
a
tone
of
perfect
conviction
but
the
army
the
army
said
i
the
army
of
course
what
i
have
to
do
is
to
get
a
commission
and
there
i
am
you
know
said
richard
and
then
he
showed
me
proved
by
elaborate
calculations
in
his
that
supposing
he
had
contracted
say
two
hundred
pounds
of
debt
in
six
months
out
of
the
army
and
that
he
contracted
no
debt
at
all
within
a
corresponding
period
in
the
army
as
to
which
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
this
step
must
involve
a
saving
of
four
hundred
pounds
in
a
year
or
two
thousand
pounds
in
five
years
which
was
a
considerable
sum
and
then
he
spoke
so
ingenuously
and
sincerely
of
the
sacrifice
he
made
in
withdrawing
himself
for
a
time
from
ada
and
of
the
earnestness
with
which
he
aspired
as
in
thought
he
always
did
i
know
full
well
to
repay
her
love
and
to
ensure
her
happiness
and
to
conquer
what
was
amiss
in
himself
and
to
acquire
the
very
soul
of
decision
that
he
made
my
heart
ache
keenly
sorely
for
i
thought
how
would
this
end
how
could
this
end
when
so
soon
and
so
surely
all
his
manly
qualities
were
touched
by
the
fatal
blight
that
ruined
everything
it
rested
on
i
spoke
to
richard
with
all
the
earnestness
i
felt
and
all
the
hope
i
could
not
quite
feel
then
and
implored
him
for
ada
sake
not
to
put
any
trust
in
chancery
to
all
i
said
richard
readily
assented
riding
over
the
court
and
everything
else
in
his
easy
way
and
drawing
the
brightest
pictures
of
the
character
he
was
to
settle
into
alas
when
the
grievous
suit
should
loose
its
hold
upon
him
we
had
a
long
talk
but
it
always
came
back
to
that
in
substance
at
last
we
came
to
soho
square
where
caddy
jellyby
had
appointed
to
wait
for
me
as
a
quiet
place
in
the
neighbourhood
of
newman
street
caddy
was
in
the
garden
in
the
centre
and
hurried
out
as
soon
as
i
appeared
after
a
few
cheerful
words
richard
left
us
together
prince
has
a
pupil
over
the
way
esther
said
caddy
and
got
the
key
for
us
so
if
you
will
walk
round
and
round
here
with
me
we
can
lock
ourselves
in
and
i
can
tell
you
comfortably
what
i
wanted
to
see
your
dear
good
face
about
very
well
my
dear
said
i
nothing
could
be
better
so
caddy
after
affectionately
squeezing
the
dear
good
face
as
she
called
it
locked
the
gate
and
took
my
arm
and
we
began
to
walk
round
the
garden
very
cosily
you
see
esther
said
caddy
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
a
little
confidence
after
you
spoke
to
me
about
its
being
wrong
to
marry
without
ma
knowledge
or
even
to
keep
ma
long
in
the
dark
respecting
our
engagement
though
i
do
believe
ma
cares
much
for
me
i
must
say
i
thought
it
right
to
mention
your
opinions
to
prince
in
the
first
place
because
i
want
to
profit
by
everything
you
tell
me
and
in
the
second
place
because
i
have
no
secrets
from
prince
i
hope
he
approved
caddy
oh
my
dear
i
assure
you
he
would
approve
of
anything
you
could
say
you
have
no
idea
what
an
opinion
he
has
of
you
indeed
esther
it
enough
to
make
anybody
but
me
jealous
said
caddy
laughing
and
shaking
her
head
but
it
only
makes
me
joyful
for
you
are
the
first
friend
i
ever
had
and
the
best
friend
i
ever
can
have
and
nobody
can
respect
and
love
you
too
much
to
please
me
upon
my
word
caddy
said
i
you
are
in
the
general
conspiracy
to
keep
me
in
a
good
humour
well
my
dear
well
i
am
going
to
tell
you
replied
caddy
crossing
her
hands
confidentially
upon
my
arm
so
we
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
and
so
i
said
to
prince
as
miss
summerson
i
hope
you
did
say
summerson
no
i
did
cried
caddy
greatly
pleased
and
with
the
brightest
of
faces
i
said
i
said
to
prince
esther
is
decidedly
of
that
opinion
prince
and
has
expressed
it
to
me
and
always
hints
it
when
she
writes
those
kind
notes
which
you
are
so
fond
of
hearing
me
read
to
you
i
am
prepared
to
disclose
the
truth
to
ma
whenever
you
think
proper
and
i
think
prince
said
i
esther
thinks
that
i
should
be
in
a
better
and
truer
and
more
honourable
position
altogether
if
you
did
the
same
to
your
papa
yes
my
dear
said
i
esther
certainly
does
think
so
so
i
was
right
you
see
exclaimed
caddy
well
this
troubled
prince
a
good
deal
not
because
he
had
the
least
doubt
about
it
but
because
he
is
so
considerate
of
the
feelings
of
old
turveydrop
and
he
had
his
apprehensions
that
old
turveydrop
might
break
his
heart
or
faint
away
or
be
very
much
overcome
in
some
affecting
manner
or
other
if
he
made
such
an
announcement
he
feared
old
turveydrop
might
consider
it
undutiful
and
might
receive
too
great
a
shock
for
old
turveydrop
deportment
is
very
beautiful
you
know
esther
said
caddy
and
his
feelings
are
extremely
sensitive
are
they
my
dear
oh
extremely
sensitive
prince
says
so
now
this
has
caused
my
darling
child
i
did
mean
to
use
the
expression
to
you
esther
caddy
apologized
her
face
suffused
with
blushes
but
i
generally
call
prince
my
darling
child
i
laughed
and
caddy
laughed
and
blushed
and
went
on
this
has
caused
him
esther
caused
whom
my
dear
oh
you
tiresome
thing
said
caddy
laughing
with
her
pretty
face
on
fire
my
darling
child
if
you
insist
upon
it
this
has
caused
him
weeks
of
uneasiness
and
has
made
him
delay
from
day
to
day
in
a
very
anxious
manner
at
last
he
said
to
me
if
miss
summerson
who
is
a
great
favourite
with
my
father
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
be
present
when
i
broke
the
subject
i
think
i
could
do
it
so
i
promised
i
would
ask
you
and
i
made
up
my
mind
besides
said
caddy
looking
at
me
hopefully
but
timidly
that
if
you
consented
i
would
ask
you
afterwards
to
come
with
me
to
ma
this
is
what
i
meant
when
i
said
in
my
note
that
i
had
a
great
favour
and
a
great
assistance
to
beg
of
you
and
if
you
thought
you
could
grant
it
esther
we
should
both
be
very
grateful
let
me
see
caddy
said
i
pretending
to
consider
really
i
think
i
could
do
a
greater
thing
than
that
if
the
need
were
pressing
i
am
at
your
service
and
the
darling
child
my
dear
whenever
you
like
caddy
was
quite
transported
by
this
reply
of
mine
being
i
believe
as
susceptible
to
the
least
kindness
or
encouragement
as
any
tender
heart
that
ever
beat
in
this
world
and
after
another
turn
or
two
round
the
garden
during
which
she
put
on
an
entirely
new
pair
of
gloves
and
made
herself
as
resplendent
as
possible
that
she
might
do
no
avoidable
discredit
to
the
master
of
deportment
we
went
to
newman
street
direct
prince
was
teaching
of
course
we
found
him
engaged
with
a
not
very
hopeful
pupil
a
stubborn
little
girl
with
a
sulky
forehead
a
deep
voice
and
an
inanimate
dissatisfied
mama
whose
case
was
certainly
not
rendered
more
hopeful
by
the
confusion
into
which
we
threw
her
preceptor
the
lesson
at
last
came
to
an
end
after
proceeding
as
discordantly
as
possible
and
when
the
little
girl
had
changed
her
shoes
and
had
had
her
white
muslin
extinguished
in
shawls
she
was
taken
away
after
a
few
words
of
preparation
we
then
went
in
search
of
turveydrop
whom
we
found
grouped
with
his
hat
and
gloves
as
a
model
of
deportment
on
the
sofa
in
his
private
apartment
the
only
comfortable
room
in
the
house
he
appeared
to
have
dressed
at
his
leisure
in
the
intervals
of
a
light
collation
and
his
brushes
and
so
forth
all
of
quite
an
elegant
kind
lay
about
father
miss
summerson
miss
jellyby
charmed
enchanted
said
turveydrop
rising
with
his
bow
permit
me
handing
chairs
be
seated
kissing
the
tips
of
his
left
fingers
overjoyed
shutting
his
eyes
and
rolling
my
little
retreat
is
made
a
paradise
recomposing
himself
on
the
sofa
like
the
second
gentleman
in
europe
again
you
find
us
miss
summerson
said
he
using
our
little
arts
to
polish
polish
again
the
sex
stimulates
us
and
rewards
us
by
the
condescension
of
its
lovely
presence
it
is
much
in
these
times
and
we
have
made
an
awfully
degenerating
business
of
it
since
the
days
of
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
my
patron
if
i
may
presume
to
say
so
to
experience
that
deportment
is
not
wholly
trodden
under
foot
by
mechanics
that
it
can
yet
bask
in
the
smile
of
beauty
my
dear
madam
i
said
nothing
which
i
thought
a
suitable
reply
and
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
my
dear
son
said
turveydrop
you
have
four
schools
this
afternoon
i
would
recommend
a
hasty
sandwich
thank
you
father
returned
prince
i
will
be
sure
to
be
punctual
my
dear
father
may
i
beg
you
to
prepare
your
mind
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
good
heaven
exclaimed
the
model
pale
and
aghast
as
prince
and
caddy
hand
in
hand
bent
down
before
him
what
is
this
is
this
lunacy
or
what
is
this
father
returned
prince
with
great
submission
i
love
this
young
lady
and
we
are
engaged
engaged
cried
turveydrop
reclining
on
the
sofa
and
shutting
out
the
sight
with
his
hand
an
arrow
launched
at
my
brain
by
my
own
child
we
have
been
engaged
for
some
time
father
faltered
prince
and
miss
summerson
hearing
of
it
advised
that
we
should
declare
the
fact
to
you
and
was
so
very
kind
as
to
attend
on
the
present
occasion
miss
jellyby
is
a
young
lady
who
deeply
respects
you
father
turveydrop
uttered
a
groan
no
pray
do
pray
do
father
urged
his
son
miss
jellyby
is
a
young
lady
who
deeply
respects
you
and
our
first
desire
is
to
consider
your
comfort
turveydrop
sobbed
no
pray
do
father
cried
his
son
boy
said
turveydrop
it
is
well
that
your
sainted
mother
is
spared
this
pang
strike
deep
and
spare
not
strike
home
sir
strike
home
pray
do
say
so
father
implored
prince
in
tears
it
goes
to
my
heart
i
do
assure
you
father
that
our
first
wish
and
intention
is
to
consider
your
comfort
caroline
and
i
do
not
forget
our
duty
what
is
my
duty
is
caroline
as
we
have
often
said
together
and
with
your
approval
and
consent
father
we
will
devote
ourselves
to
making
your
life
agreeable
strike
home
murmured
turveydrop
strike
home
but
he
seemed
to
listen
i
thought
too
my
dear
father
returned
prince
we
well
know
what
little
comforts
you
are
accustomed
to
and
have
a
right
to
and
it
will
always
be
our
study
and
our
pride
to
provide
those
before
anything
if
you
will
bless
us
with
your
approval
and
consent
father
we
shall
not
think
of
being
married
until
it
is
quite
agreeable
to
you
and
when
we
are
married
we
shall
always
make
you
of
course
our
first
consideration
you
must
ever
be
the
head
and
master
here
father
and
we
feel
how
truly
unnatural
it
would
be
in
us
if
we
failed
to
know
it
or
if
we
failed
to
exert
ourselves
in
every
possible
way
to
please
you
turveydrop
underwent
a
severe
internal
struggle
and
came
upright
on
the
sofa
again
with
his
cheeks
puffing
over
his
stiff
cravat
a
perfect
model
of
parental
deportment
my
son
said
turveydrop
my
children
i
can
not
resist
your
prayer
be
happy
his
benignity
as
he
raised
his
future
and
stretched
out
his
hand
to
his
son
who
kissed
it
with
affectionate
respect
and
gratitude
was
the
most
confusing
sight
i
ever
saw
my
children
said
turveydrop
paternally
encircling
caddy
with
his
left
arm
as
she
sat
beside
him
and
putting
his
right
hand
gracefully
on
his
hip
my
son
and
daughter
your
happiness
shall
be
my
care
i
will
watch
over
you
you
shall
always
live
with
me
meaning
of
course
i
will
always
live
with
you
this
house
is
henceforth
as
much
yours
as
mine
consider
it
your
home
may
you
long
live
to
share
it
with
me
the
power
of
his
deportment
was
such
that
they
really
were
as
much
overcome
with
thankfulness
as
if
instead
of
quartering
himself
upon
them
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
were
making
some
munificent
sacrifice
in
their
favour
for
myself
my
children
said
turveydrop
i
am
falling
into
the
sear
and
yellow
leaf
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
long
the
last
feeble
traces
of
gentlemanly
deportment
may
linger
in
this
weaving
and
spinning
age
but
so
long
i
will
do
my
duty
to
society
and
will
show
myself
as
usual
about
town
my
wants
are
few
and
simple
my
little
apartment
here
my
few
essentials
for
the
toilet
my
frugal
morning
meal
and
my
little
dinner
will
suffice
i
charge
your
dutiful
affection
with
the
supply
of
these
requirements
and
i
charge
myself
with
all
the
rest
they
were
overpowered
afresh
by
his
uncommon
generosity
my
son
said
turveydrop
for
those
little
points
in
which
you
are
deficient
points
of
deportment
which
are
born
with
a
man
which
may
be
improved
by
cultivation
but
can
never
be
originated
you
may
still
rely
on
me
i
have
been
faithful
to
my
post
since
the
days
of
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
and
i
will
not
desert
it
now
no
my
son
if
you
have
ever
contemplated
your
father
poor
position
with
a
feeling
of
pride
you
may
rest
assured
that
he
will
do
nothing
to
tarnish
it
for
yourself
prince
whose
character
is
different
we
can
not
be
all
alike
nor
is
it
advisable
that
we
should
work
be
industrious
earn
money
and
extend
the
connexion
as
much
as
possible
that
you
may
depend
i
will
do
dear
father
with
all
my
heart
replied
prince
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
turveydrop
your
qualities
are
not
shining
my
dear
child
but
they
are
steady
and
useful
and
to
both
of
you
my
children
i
would
merely
observe
in
the
spirit
of
a
sainted
wooman
on
whose
path
i
had
the
happiness
of
casting
i
believe
some
ray
of
light
take
care
of
the
establishment
take
care
of
my
simple
wants
and
bless
you
both
old
turveydrop
then
became
so
very
gallant
in
honour
of
the
occasion
that
i
told
caddy
we
must
really
go
to
thavies
inn
at
once
if
we
were
to
go
at
all
that
day
so
we
took
our
departure
after
a
very
loving
farewell
between
caddy
and
her
betrothed
and
during
our
walk
she
was
so
happy
and
so
full
of
old
turveydrop
praises
that
i
would
not
have
said
a
word
in
his
disparagement
for
any
consideration
the
house
in
thavies
inn
had
bills
in
the
windows
announcing
that
it
was
to
let
and
it
looked
dirtier
and
gloomier
and
ghastlier
than
ever
the
name
of
poor
jellyby
had
appeared
in
the
list
of
bankrupts
but
a
day
or
two
before
and
he
was
shut
up
in
the
with
two
gentlemen
and
a
heap
of
blue
bags
and
papers
making
the
most
desperate
endeavours
to
understand
his
affairs
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
quite
beyond
his
comprehension
for
when
caddy
took
me
into
the
by
mistake
and
we
came
upon
jellyby
in
his
spectacles
forlornly
fenced
into
a
corner
by
the
great
and
the
two
gentlemen
he
seemed
to
have
given
up
the
whole
thing
and
to
be
speechless
and
insensible
going
upstairs
to
jellyby
room
the
children
were
all
screaming
in
the
kitchen
and
there
was
no
servant
to
be
seen
we
found
that
lady
in
the
midst
of
a
voluminous
correspondence
opening
reading
and
sorting
letters
with
a
great
accumulation
of
torn
covers
on
the
floor
she
was
so
preoccupied
that
at
first
she
did
not
know
me
though
she
sat
looking
at
me
with
that
curious
look
of
hers
ah
miss
summerson
she
said
at
last
i
was
thinking
of
something
so
different
i
hope
you
are
well
i
am
happy
to
see
you
jarndyce
and
miss
clare
quite
well
i
hoped
in
return
that
jellyby
was
quite
well
why
not
quite
my
dear
said
jellyby
in
the
calmest
manner
he
has
been
unfortunate
in
his
affairs
and
is
a
little
out
of
spirits
happily
for
me
i
am
so
much
engaged
that
i
have
no
time
to
think
about
it
we
have
at
the
present
moment
one
hundred
and
seventy
families
miss
summerson
averaging
five
persons
in
each
either
gone
or
going
to
the
left
bank
of
the
niger
i
thought
of
the
one
family
so
near
us
who
were
neither
gone
nor
going
to
the
left
bank
of
the
niger
and
wondered
how
she
could
be
so
placid
you
have
brought
caddy
back
i
see
observed
jellyby
with
a
glance
at
her
daughter
it
has
become
quite
a
novelty
to
see
her
here
she
has
almost
deserted
her
old
employment
and
in
fact
obliges
me
to
employ
a
boy
i
am
sure
ma
began
caddy
now
you
know
caddy
her
mother
mildly
interposed
that
i
do
employ
a
boy
who
is
now
at
his
dinner
what
is
the
use
of
your
contradicting
i
was
not
going
to
contradict
ma
returned
caddy
i
was
only
going
to
say
that
surely
you
would
have
me
be
a
mere
drudge
all
my
life
i
believe
my
dear
said
jellyby
still
opening
her
letters
casting
her
bright
eyes
smilingly
over
them
and
sorting
them
as
she
spoke
that
you
have
a
business
example
before
you
in
your
mother
besides
a
mere
drudge
if
you
had
any
sympathy
with
the
destinies
of
the
human
race
it
would
raise
you
high
above
any
such
idea
but
you
have
none
i
have
often
told
you
caddy
you
have
no
such
sympathy
not
if
it
africa
ma
i
have
not
of
course
you
have
not
now
if
i
were
not
happily
so
much
engaged
miss
summerson
said
jellyby
sweetly
casting
her
eyes
for
a
moment
on
me
and
considering
where
to
put
the
particular
letter
she
had
just
opened
this
would
distress
and
disappoint
me
but
i
have
so
much
to
think
of
in
connexion
with
and
it
is
so
necessary
i
should
concentrate
myself
that
there
is
my
remedy
you
see
as
caddy
gave
me
a
glance
of
entreaty
and
as
jellyby
was
looking
far
away
into
africa
straight
through
my
bonnet
and
head
i
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
come
to
the
subject
of
my
visit
and
to
attract
jellyby
attention
perhaps
i
began
you
will
wonder
what
has
brought
me
here
to
interrupt
you
i
am
always
delighted
to
see
miss
summerson
said
jellyby
pursuing
her
employment
with
a
placid
smile
though
i
wish
and
she
shook
her
head
she
was
more
interested
in
the
borrioboolan
project
i
have
come
with
caddy
said
i
because
caddy
justly
thinks
she
ought
not
to
have
a
secret
from
her
mother
and
fancies
i
shall
encourage
and
aid
her
though
i
am
sure
i
do
know
how
in
imparting
one
caddy
said
jellyby
pausing
for
a
moment
in
her
occupation
and
then
serenely
pursuing
it
after
shaking
her
head
you
are
going
to
tell
me
some
nonsense
caddy
untied
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
took
her
bonnet
off
and
letting
it
dangle
on
the
floor
by
the
strings
and
crying
heartily
said
ma
i
am
engaged
oh
you
ridiculous
child
observed
jellyby
with
an
abstracted
air
as
she
looked
over
the
dispatch
last
opened
what
a
goose
you
are
i
am
engaged
ma
sobbed
caddy
to
young
turveydrop
at
the
academy
and
old
turveydrop
who
is
a
very
gentlemanly
man
indeed
has
given
his
consent
and
i
beg
and
pray
you
give
us
yours
ma
because
i
never
could
be
happy
without
it
i
never
never
could
sobbed
caddy
quite
forgetful
of
her
general
complainings
and
of
everything
but
her
natural
affection
you
see
again
miss
summerson
observed
jellyby
serenely
what
a
happiness
it
is
to
be
so
much
occupied
as
i
am
and
to
have
this
necessity
for
that
i
have
here
is
caddy
engaged
to
a
son
mixed
up
with
people
who
have
no
more
sympathy
with
the
destinies
of
the
human
race
than
she
has
herself
this
too
when
quale
one
of
the
first
philanthropists
of
our
time
has
mentioned
to
me
that
he
was
really
disposed
to
be
interested
in
her
ma
i
always
hated
and
detested
mr
quale
sobbed
caddy
caddy
caddy
returned
jellyby
opening
another
letter
with
the
greatest
complacency
i
have
no
doubt
you
did
how
could
you
do
otherwise
being
totally
destitute
of
the
sympathies
with
which
he
overflows
now
if
my
public
duties
were
not
a
favourite
child
to
me
if
i
were
not
occupied
with
large
measures
on
a
vast
scale
these
petty
details
might
grieve
me
very
much
miss
summerson
but
can
i
permit
the
film
of
a
silly
proceeding
on
the
part
of
caddy
from
whom
i
expect
nothing
else
to
interpose
between
me
and
the
great
african
continent
no
no
repeated
jellyby
in
a
calm
clear
voice
and
with
an
agreeable
smile
as
she
opened
more
letters
and
sorted
them
no
indeed
i
was
so
unprepared
for
the
perfect
coolness
of
this
reception
though
i
might
have
expected
it
that
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
caddy
seemed
equally
at
a
loss
jellyby
continued
to
open
and
sort
letters
and
to
repeat
occasionally
in
quite
a
charming
tone
of
voice
and
with
a
smile
of
perfect
composure
no
indeed
i
hope
ma
sobbed
poor
caddy
at
last
you
are
not
angry
oh
caddy
you
really
are
an
absurd
girl
returned
jellyby
to
ask
such
questions
after
what
i
have
said
of
the
preoccupation
of
my
mind
and
i
hope
ma
you
give
us
your
consent
and
wish
us
well
said
caddy
you
are
a
nonsensical
child
to
have
done
anything
of
this
kind
said
jellyby
and
a
degenerate
child
when
you
might
have
devoted
yourself
to
the
great
public
measure
but
the
step
is
taken
and
i
have
engaged
a
boy
and
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
now
pray
caddy
said
jellyby
for
caddy
was
kissing
her
do
delay
me
in
my
work
but
let
me
clear
off
this
heavy
batch
of
papers
before
the
afternoon
post
comes
in
i
thought
i
could
not
do
better
than
take
my
leave
i
was
detained
for
a
moment
by
caddy
saying
you
wo
object
to
my
bringing
him
to
see
you
ma
oh
dear
me
caddy
cried
jellyby
who
had
relapsed
into
that
distant
contemplation
have
you
begun
again
bring
whom
him
ma
caddy
caddy
said
jellyby
quite
weary
of
such
little
matters
then
you
must
bring
him
some
evening
which
is
not
a
parent
society
night
or
a
branch
night
or
a
ramification
night
you
must
accommodate
the
visit
to
the
demands
upon
my
time
my
dear
miss
summerson
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
come
here
to
help
out
this
silly
chit
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
new
letters
from
manufacturing
families
anxious
to
understand
the
details
of
the
native
and
question
this
morning
i
need
not
apologize
for
having
very
little
leisure
i
was
not
surprised
by
caddy
being
in
low
spirits
when
we
went
downstairs
or
by
her
sobbing
afresh
on
my
neck
or
by
her
saying
she
would
far
rather
have
been
scolded
than
treated
with
such
indifference
or
by
her
confiding
to
me
that
she
was
so
poor
in
clothes
that
how
she
was
ever
to
be
married
creditably
she
know
i
gradually
cheered
her
up
by
dwelling
on
the
many
things
she
would
do
for
her
unfortunate
father
and
for
peepy
when
she
had
a
home
of
her
own
and
finally
we
went
downstairs
into
the
damp
dark
kitchen
where
peepy
and
his
little
brothers
and
sisters
were
grovelling
on
the
stone
floor
and
where
we
had
such
a
game
of
play
with
them
that
to
prevent
myself
from
being
quite
torn
to
pieces
i
was
obliged
to
fall
back
on
my
from
time
to
time
i
heard
loud
voices
in
the
parlour
overhead
and
occasionally
a
violent
tumbling
about
of
the
furniture
the
last
effect
i
am
afraid
was
caused
by
poor
jellyby
breaking
away
from
the
and
making
rushes
at
the
window
with
the
intention
of
throwing
himself
into
the
area
whenever
he
made
any
new
attempt
to
understand
his
affairs
as
i
rode
quietly
home
at
night
after
the
day
bustle
i
thought
a
good
deal
of
caddy
engagement
and
felt
confirmed
in
my
hopes
in
spite
of
the
elder
turveydrop
that
she
would
be
the
happier
and
better
for
it
and
if
there
seemed
to
be
but
a
slender
chance
of
her
and
her
husband
ever
finding
out
what
the
model
of
deportment
really
was
why
that
was
all
for
the
best
too
and
who
would
wish
them
to
be
wiser
i
did
not
wish
them
to
be
any
wiser
and
indeed
was
half
ashamed
of
not
entirely
believing
in
him
myself
and
i
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
thought
about
travellers
in
distant
countries
and
the
stars
they
saw
and
hoped
i
might
always
be
so
blest
and
happy
as
to
be
useful
to
some
one
in
my
small
way
they
were
so
glad
to
see
me
when
i
got
home
as
they
always
were
that
i
could
have
sat
down
and
cried
for
joy
if
that
had
not
been
a
method
of
making
myself
disagreeable
everybody
in
the
house
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
showed
me
such
a
bright
face
of
welcome
and
spoke
so
cheerily
and
was
so
happy
to
do
anything
for
me
that
i
suppose
there
never
was
such
a
fortunate
little
creature
in
the
world
we
got
into
such
a
chatty
state
that
night
through
ada
and
my
guardian
drawing
me
out
to
tell
them
all
about
caddy
that
i
went
on
prose
prose
prosing
for
a
length
of
time
at
last
i
got
up
to
my
own
room
quite
red
to
think
how
i
had
been
holding
forth
and
then
i
heard
a
soft
tap
at
my
door
so
i
said
come
in
and
there
came
in
a
pretty
little
girl
neatly
dressed
in
mourning
who
dropped
a
curtsy
if
you
please
miss
said
the
little
girl
in
a
soft
voice
i
am
charley
why
so
you
are
said
i
stooping
down
in
astonishment
and
giving
her
a
kiss
how
glad
am
i
to
see
you
charley
if
you
please
miss
pursued
charley
in
the
same
soft
voice
your
maid
charley
if
you
please
miss
i
a
present
to
you
with
love
i
sat
down
with
my
hand
on
charley
neck
and
looked
at
charley
and
oh
miss
says
charley
clapping
her
hands
with
the
tears
starting
down
her
dimpled
cheeks
tom
at
school
if
you
please
and
learning
so
good
and
little
emma
she
with
blinder
miss
took
such
care
of
and
tom
he
would
have
been
at
school
and
emma
she
would
have
been
left
with
blinder
and
me
i
should
have
been
here
all
a
deal
sooner
miss
only
jarndyce
thought
that
tom
and
emma
and
me
had
better
get
a
little
used
to
parting
first
we
was
so
small
do
cry
if
you
please
miss
i
ca
help
it
charley
no
miss
nor
i
ca
help
it
says
charley
and
if
you
please
miss
jarndyce
love
and
he
thinks
you
like
to
teach
me
now
and
then
and
if
you
please
tom
and
emma
and
me
is
to
see
each
other
once
a
month
and
i
so
happy
and
so
thankful
miss
cried
charley
with
a
heaving
heart
and
i
try
to
be
such
a
good
maid
oh
charley
dear
never
forget
who
did
all
this
no
miss
i
never
will
nor
tom
wo
nor
yet
emma
it
was
all
you
miss
i
have
known
nothing
of
it
it
was
jarndyce
charley
yes
miss
but
it
was
all
done
for
the
love
of
you
and
that
you
might
be
my
mistress
if
you
please
miss
i
am
a
little
present
with
his
love
and
it
was
all
done
for
the
love
of
you
me
and
tom
was
to
be
sure
to
remember
it
charley
dried
her
eyes
and
entered
on
her
functions
going
in
her
matronly
little
way
about
and
about
the
room
and
folding
up
everything
she
could
lay
her
hands
upon
presently
charley
came
creeping
back
to
my
side
and
said
oh
do
cry
if
you
please
miss
and
i
said
again
i
ca
help
it
charley
and
charley
said
again
no
miss
nor
i
ca
help
it
and
so
after
all
i
did
cry
for
joy
indeed
and
so
did
she
chapter
xxiv
an
appeal
case
as
soon
as
richard
and
i
had
held
the
conversation
of
which
i
have
given
an
account
richard
communicated
the
state
of
his
mind
to
jarndyce
i
doubt
if
my
guardian
were
altogether
taken
by
surprise
when
he
received
the
representation
though
it
caused
him
much
uneasiness
and
disappointment
he
and
richard
were
often
closeted
together
late
at
night
and
early
in
the
morning
and
passed
whole
days
in
london
and
had
innumerable
appointments
with
kenge
and
laboured
through
a
quantity
of
disagreeable
business
while
they
were
thus
employed
my
guardian
though
he
underwent
considerable
inconvenience
from
the
state
of
the
wind
and
rubbed
his
head
so
constantly
that
not
a
single
hair
upon
it
ever
rested
in
its
right
place
was
as
genial
with
ada
and
me
as
at
any
other
time
but
maintained
a
steady
reserve
on
these
matters
and
as
our
utmost
endeavours
could
only
elicit
from
richard
himself
sweeping
assurances
that
everything
was
going
on
capitally
and
that
it
really
was
all
right
at
last
our
anxiety
was
not
much
relieved
by
him
we
learnt
however
as
the
time
went
on
that
a
new
application
was
made
to
the
lord
chancellor
on
richard
behalf
as
an
infant
and
a
ward
and
i
do
know
what
and
that
there
was
a
quantity
of
talking
and
that
the
lord
chancellor
described
him
in
open
court
as
a
vexatious
and
capricious
infant
and
that
the
matter
was
adjourned
and
readjourned
and
referred
and
reported
on
and
petitioned
about
until
richard
began
to
doubt
as
he
told
us
whether
if
he
entered
the
army
at
all
it
would
not
be
as
a
veteran
of
seventy
or
eighty
years
of
age
at
last
an
appointment
was
made
for
him
to
see
the
lord
chancellor
again
in
his
private
room
and
there
the
lord
chancellor
very
seriously
reproved
him
for
trifling
with
time
and
not
knowing
his
mind
a
pretty
good
joke
i
think
said
richard
from
that
quarter
and
at
last
it
was
settled
that
his
application
should
be
granted
his
name
was
entered
at
the
horse
guards
as
an
applicant
for
an
ensign
commission
the
was
deposited
at
an
agent
and
richard
in
his
usual
characteristic
way
plunged
into
a
violent
course
of
military
study
and
got
up
at
five
every
morning
to
practise
the
broadsword
exercise
thus
vacation
succeeded
term
and
term
succeeded
vacation
we
sometimes
heard
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
as
being
in
the
paper
or
out
of
the
paper
or
as
being
to
be
mentioned
or
as
being
to
be
spoken
to
and
it
came
on
and
it
went
off
richard
who
was
now
in
a
professor
house
in
london
was
able
to
be
with
us
less
frequently
than
before
my
guardian
still
maintained
the
same
reserve
and
so
time
passed
until
the
commission
was
obtained
and
richard
received
directions
with
it
to
join
a
regiment
in
ireland
he
arrived
with
the
intelligence
one
evening
and
had
a
long
conference
with
my
guardian
upwards
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
my
guardian
put
his
head
into
the
room
where
ada
and
i
were
sitting
and
said
come
in
my
dears
we
went
in
and
found
richard
whom
we
had
last
seen
in
high
spirits
leaning
on
the
looking
mortified
and
angry
rick
and
i
ada
said
jarndyce
are
not
quite
of
one
mind
come
come
rick
put
a
brighter
face
upon
it
you
are
very
hard
with
me
sir
said
richard
the
harder
because
you
have
been
so
considerate
to
me
in
all
other
respects
and
have
done
me
kindnesses
that
i
can
never
acknowledge
i
never
could
have
been
set
right
without
you
sir
well
well
said
jarndyce
i
want
to
set
you
more
right
yet
i
want
to
set
you
more
right
with
yourself
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
saying
sir
returned
richard
in
a
fiery
way
but
yet
respectfully
that
i
think
i
am
the
best
judge
about
myself
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
saying
my
dear
rick
observed
jarndyce
with
the
sweetest
cheerfulness
and
good
humour
that
quite
natural
in
you
to
think
so
but
i
do
think
so
i
must
do
my
duty
rick
or
you
could
never
care
for
me
in
cool
blood
and
i
hope
you
will
always
care
for
me
cool
and
hot
ada
had
turned
so
pale
that
he
made
her
sit
down
in
his
and
sat
beside
her
it
nothing
my
dear
he
said
it
nothing
rick
and
i
have
only
had
a
friendly
difference
which
we
must
state
to
you
for
you
are
the
theme
now
you
are
afraid
of
what
coming
i
am
not
indeed
cousin
john
replied
ada
with
a
smile
if
it
is
to
come
from
you
thank
you
my
dear
do
you
give
me
a
minute
calm
attention
without
looking
at
rick
and
little
woman
do
you
likewise
my
dear
girl
putting
his
hand
on
hers
as
it
lay
on
the
side
of
the
you
recollect
the
talk
we
had
we
four
when
the
little
woman
told
me
of
a
little
love
affair
it
is
not
likely
that
either
richard
or
i
can
ever
forget
your
kindness
that
day
cousin
john
i
can
never
forget
it
said
richard
and
i
can
never
forget
it
said
ada
so
much
the
easier
what
i
have
to
say
and
so
much
the
easier
for
us
to
agree
returned
my
guardian
his
face
irradiated
by
the
gentleness
and
honour
of
his
heart
ada
my
bird
you
should
know
that
rick
has
now
chosen
his
profession
for
the
last
time
all
that
he
has
of
certainty
will
be
expended
when
he
is
fully
equipped
he
has
exhausted
his
resources
and
is
bound
henceforward
to
the
tree
he
has
planted
quite
true
that
i
have
exhausted
my
present
resources
and
i
am
quite
content
to
know
it
but
what
i
have
of
certainty
sir
said
richard
is
not
all
i
have
rick
rick
cried
my
guardian
with
a
sudden
terror
in
his
manner
and
in
an
altered
voice
and
putting
up
his
hands
as
if
he
would
have
stopped
his
ears
for
the
love
of
god
do
found
a
hope
or
expectation
on
the
family
curse
whatever
you
do
on
this
side
the
grave
never
give
one
lingering
glance
towards
the
horrible
phantom
that
has
haunted
us
so
many
years
better
to
borrow
better
to
beg
better
to
die
we
were
all
startled
by
the
fervour
of
this
warning
richard
bit
his
lip
and
held
his
breath
and
glanced
at
me
as
if
he
felt
and
knew
that
i
felt
too
how
much
he
needed
it
ada
my
dear
said
jarndyce
recovering
his
cheerfulness
these
are
strong
words
of
advice
but
i
live
in
bleak
house
and
have
seen
a
sight
here
enough
of
that
all
richard
had
to
start
him
in
the
race
of
life
is
ventured
i
recommend
to
him
and
you
for
his
sake
and
your
own
that
he
should
depart
from
us
with
the
understanding
that
there
is
no
sort
of
contract
between
you
i
must
go
further
i
will
be
plain
with
you
both
you
were
to
confide
freely
in
me
and
i
will
confide
freely
in
you
i
ask
you
wholly
to
relinquish
for
the
present
any
tie
but
your
relationship
better
to
say
at
once
sir
returned
richard
that
you
renounce
all
confidence
in
me
and
that
you
advise
ada
to
do
the
same
better
to
say
nothing
of
the
sort
rick
because
i
do
mean
it
you
think
i
have
begun
ill
sir
retorted
richard
i
have
i
know
how
i
hoped
you
would
begin
and
how
go
on
i
told
you
when
we
spoke
of
these
things
last
said
jarndyce
in
a
cordial
and
encouraging
manner
you
have
not
made
that
beginning
yet
but
there
is
a
time
for
all
things
and
yours
is
not
gone
by
rather
it
is
just
now
fully
come
make
a
clear
beginning
altogether
you
two
very
young
my
dears
are
cousins
as
yet
you
are
nothing
more
what
more
may
come
must
come
of
being
worked
out
rick
and
no
sooner
you
are
very
hard
with
me
sir
said
richard
harder
than
i
could
have
supposed
you
would
be
my
dear
boy
said
jarndyce
i
am
harder
with
myself
when
i
do
anything
that
gives
you
pain
you
have
your
remedy
in
your
own
hands
ada
it
is
better
for
him
that
he
should
be
free
and
that
there
should
be
no
youthful
engagement
between
you
rick
it
is
better
for
her
much
better
you
owe
it
to
her
come
each
of
you
will
do
what
is
best
for
the
other
if
not
what
is
best
for
yourselves
why
is
it
best
sir
returned
richard
hastily
it
was
not
when
we
opened
our
hearts
to
you
you
did
not
say
so
then
i
have
had
experience
since
i
do
blame
you
rick
but
i
have
had
experience
since
you
mean
of
me
sir
well
yes
of
both
of
you
said
jarndyce
kindly
the
time
is
not
come
for
your
standing
pledged
to
one
another
it
is
not
right
and
i
must
not
recognize
it
come
come
my
young
cousins
begin
afresh
bygones
shall
be
bygones
and
a
new
page
turned
for
you
to
write
your
lives
in
richard
gave
an
anxious
glance
at
ada
but
said
nothing
i
have
avoided
saying
one
word
to
either
of
you
or
to
esther
said
jarndyce
until
now
in
order
that
we
might
be
open
as
the
day
and
all
on
equal
terms
i
now
affectionately
advise
i
now
most
earnestly
entreat
you
two
to
part
as
you
came
here
leave
all
else
to
time
truth
and
steadfastness
if
you
do
otherwise
you
will
do
wrong
and
you
will
have
made
me
do
wrong
in
ever
bringing
you
together
a
long
silence
succeeded
cousin
richard
said
ada
then
raising
her
blue
eyes
tenderly
to
his
face
after
what
our
cousin
john
has
said
i
think
no
choice
is
left
us
your
mind
may
be
quite
at
ease
about
me
for
you
will
leave
me
here
under
his
care
and
will
be
sure
that
i
can
have
nothing
to
wish
for
quite
sure
if
i
guide
myself
by
his
advice
i
i
doubt
cousin
richard
said
ada
a
little
confused
that
you
are
very
fond
of
me
and
i
i
do
think
you
will
fall
in
love
with
anybody
else
but
i
should
like
you
to
consider
well
about
it
too
as
i
should
like
you
to
be
in
all
things
very
happy
you
may
trust
in
me
cousin
richard
i
am
not
at
all
changeable
but
i
am
not
unreasonable
and
should
never
blame
you
even
cousins
may
be
sorry
to
part
and
in
truth
i
am
very
very
sorry
richard
though
i
know
it
for
your
welfare
i
shall
always
think
of
you
affectionately
and
often
talk
of
you
with
esther
and
and
perhaps
you
will
sometimes
think
a
little
of
me
cousin
richard
so
now
said
ada
going
up
to
him
and
giving
him
her
trembling
hand
we
are
only
cousins
again
richard
for
the
time
perhaps
and
i
pray
for
a
blessing
on
my
dear
cousin
wherever
he
goes
it
was
strange
to
me
that
richard
should
not
be
able
to
forgive
my
guardian
for
entertaining
the
very
same
opinion
of
him
which
he
himself
had
expressed
of
himself
in
much
stronger
terms
to
me
but
it
was
certainly
the
case
i
observed
with
great
regret
that
from
this
hour
he
never
was
as
free
and
open
with
jarndyce
as
he
had
been
before
he
had
every
reason
given
him
to
be
so
but
he
was
not
and
solely
on
his
side
an
estrangement
began
to
arise
between
them
in
the
business
of
preparation
and
equipment
he
soon
lost
himself
and
even
his
grief
at
parting
from
ada
who
remained
in
hertfordshire
while
he
jarndyce
and
i
went
up
to
london
for
a
week
he
remembered
her
by
fits
and
starts
even
with
bursts
of
tears
and
at
such
times
would
confide
to
me
the
heaviest
but
in
a
few
minutes
he
would
recklessly
conjure
up
some
undefinable
means
by
which
they
were
both
to
be
made
rich
and
happy
for
ever
and
would
become
as
gay
as
possible
it
was
a
busy
time
and
i
trotted
about
with
him
all
day
long
buying
a
variety
of
things
of
which
he
stood
in
need
of
the
things
he
would
have
bought
if
he
had
been
left
to
his
own
ways
i
say
nothing
he
was
perfectly
confidential
with
me
and
often
talked
so
sensibly
and
feelingly
about
his
faults
and
his
vigorous
resolutions
and
dwelt
so
much
upon
the
encouragement
he
derived
from
these
conversations
that
i
could
never
have
been
tired
if
i
had
tried
there
used
in
that
week
to
come
backward
and
forward
to
our
lodging
to
fence
with
richard
a
person
who
had
formerly
been
a
cavalry
soldier
he
was
a
fine
man
of
a
frank
free
bearing
with
whom
richard
had
practised
for
some
months
i
heard
so
much
about
him
not
only
from
richard
but
from
my
guardian
too
that
i
was
purposely
in
the
room
with
my
work
one
morning
after
breakfast
when
he
came
good
morning
george
said
my
guardian
who
happened
to
be
alone
with
me
carstone
will
be
here
directly
meanwhile
miss
summerson
is
very
happy
to
see
you
i
know
sit
down
he
sat
down
a
little
disconcerted
by
my
presence
i
thought
and
without
looking
at
me
drew
his
heavy
sunburnt
hand
across
and
across
his
upper
lip
you
are
as
punctual
as
the
sun
said
jarndyce
military
time
sir
he
replied
force
of
habit
a
mere
habit
in
me
sir
i
am
not
at
all
yet
you
have
a
large
establishment
too
i
am
told
said
jarndyce
not
much
of
a
one
sir
i
keep
a
shooting
gallery
but
not
much
of
a
one
and
what
kind
of
a
shot
and
what
kind
of
a
swordsman
do
you
make
of
mr
carstone
said
my
guardian
pretty
good
sir
he
replied
folding
his
arms
upon
his
broad
chest
and
looking
very
large
if
carstone
was
to
give
his
full
mind
to
it
he
would
come
out
very
good
but
he
do
i
suppose
said
my
guardian
he
did
at
first
sir
but
not
afterwards
not
his
full
mind
perhaps
he
has
something
else
upon
it
some
young
lady
perhaps
his
bright
dark
eyes
glanced
at
me
for
the
first
time
he
has
not
me
upon
his
mind
i
assure
you
george
said
i
laughing
though
you
seem
to
suspect
me
he
reddened
a
little
through
his
brown
and
made
me
a
trooper
bow
no
offence
i
hope
miss
i
am
one
of
the
roughs
not
at
all
said
i
i
take
it
as
a
compliment
if
he
had
not
looked
at
me
before
he
looked
at
me
now
in
three
or
four
quick
successive
glances
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
said
to
my
guardian
with
a
manly
kind
of
diffidence
but
you
did
me
the
honour
to
mention
the
young
lady
name
miss
summerson
miss
summerson
he
repeated
and
looked
at
me
again
do
you
know
the
name
i
asked
no
miss
to
my
knowledge
i
never
heard
it
i
thought
i
had
seen
you
somewhere
i
think
not
i
returned
raising
my
head
from
my
work
to
look
at
him
and
there
was
something
so
genuine
in
his
speech
and
manner
that
i
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
i
remember
faces
very
well
so
do
i
miss
he
returned
meeting
my
look
with
the
fullness
of
his
dark
eyes
and
broad
forehead
humph
what
set
me
off
now
upon
that
his
once
more
reddening
through
his
brown
and
being
disconcerted
by
his
efforts
to
remember
the
association
brought
my
guardian
to
his
relief
have
you
many
pupils
mr
george
they
vary
in
their
number
sir
mostly
they
but
a
small
lot
to
live
by
and
what
classes
of
chance
people
come
to
practise
at
your
gallery
all
sorts
sir
natives
and
foreigners
from
gentlemen
to
i
have
had
frenchwomen
come
before
now
and
show
themselves
dabs
at
mad
people
out
of
number
of
course
but
they
go
everywhere
where
the
doors
stand
open
people
do
come
with
grudges
and
schemes
of
finishing
their
practice
with
live
targets
i
hope
said
my
guardian
smiling
not
much
of
that
sir
though
that
has
happened
mostly
they
come
for
skill
or
idleness
six
of
one
and
of
the
other
i
beg
your
pardon
said
george
sitting
stiffly
upright
and
squaring
an
elbow
on
each
knee
but
i
believe
you
a
chancery
suitor
if
i
have
heard
correct
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
am
i
have
had
one
of
your
compatriots
in
my
time
sir
a
chancery
suitor
returned
my
guardian
how
was
that
why
the
man
was
so
badgered
and
worried
and
tortured
by
being
knocked
about
from
post
to
pillar
and
from
pillar
to
post
said
george
that
he
got
out
of
sorts
i
do
believe
he
had
any
idea
of
taking
aim
at
anybody
but
he
was
in
that
condition
of
resentment
and
violence
that
he
would
come
and
pay
for
fifty
shots
and
fire
away
till
he
was
red
hot
one
day
i
said
to
him
when
there
was
nobody
by
and
he
had
been
talking
to
me
angrily
about
his
wrongs
this
practice
is
a
comrade
well
and
good
but
i
altogether
like
your
being
so
bent
upon
it
in
your
present
state
of
mind
i
rather
you
took
to
something
else
i
was
on
my
guard
for
a
blow
he
was
that
passionate
but
he
received
it
in
very
good
part
and
left
off
directly
we
shook
hands
and
struck
up
a
sort
of
friendship
what
was
that
man
asked
my
guardian
in
a
new
tone
of
interest
why
he
began
by
being
a
small
shropshire
farmer
before
they
made
a
baited
bull
of
him
said
george
was
his
name
gridley
it
was
sir
george
directed
another
succession
of
quick
bright
glances
at
me
as
my
guardian
and
i
exchanged
a
word
or
two
of
surprise
at
the
coincidence
and
i
therefore
explained
to
him
how
we
knew
the
name
he
made
me
another
of
his
soldierly
bows
in
acknowledgment
of
what
he
called
my
condescension
i
do
know
he
said
as
he
looked
at
me
what
it
is
that
sets
me
off
again
but
bosh
what
my
head
running
against
he
passed
one
of
his
heavy
hands
over
his
crisp
dark
hair
as
if
to
sweep
the
broken
thoughts
out
of
his
mind
and
sat
a
little
forward
with
one
arm
akimbo
and
the
other
resting
on
his
leg
looking
in
a
brown
study
at
the
ground
i
am
sorry
to
learn
that
the
same
state
of
mind
has
got
this
gridley
into
new
troubles
and
that
he
is
in
hiding
said
my
guardian
so
i
am
told
sir
returned
george
still
musing
and
looking
on
the
ground
so
i
am
told
you
do
know
where
no
sir
returned
the
trooper
lifting
up
his
eyes
and
coming
out
of
his
reverie
i
ca
say
anything
about
him
he
will
be
worn
out
soon
i
expect
you
may
file
a
strong
man
heart
away
for
a
good
many
years
but
it
will
tell
all
of
a
sudden
at
last
richard
entrance
stopped
the
conversation
george
rose
made
me
another
of
his
soldierly
bows
wished
my
guardian
a
good
day
and
strode
heavily
out
of
the
room
this
was
the
morning
of
the
day
appointed
for
richard
departure
we
had
no
more
purchases
to
make
now
i
had
completed
all
his
packing
early
in
the
afternoon
and
our
time
was
disengaged
until
night
when
he
was
to
go
to
liverpool
for
holyhead
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
being
again
expected
to
come
on
that
day
richard
proposed
to
me
that
we
should
go
down
to
the
court
and
hear
what
passed
as
it
was
his
last
day
and
he
was
eager
to
go
and
i
had
never
been
there
i
gave
my
consent
and
we
walked
down
to
westminster
where
the
court
was
then
sitting
we
beguiled
the
way
with
arrangements
concerning
the
letters
that
richard
was
to
write
to
me
and
the
letters
that
i
was
to
write
to
him
and
with
a
great
many
hopeful
projects
my
guardian
knew
where
we
were
going
and
therefore
was
not
with
us
when
we
came
to
the
court
there
was
the
lord
chancellor
the
same
whom
i
had
seen
in
his
private
room
in
lincoln
inn
sitting
in
great
state
and
gravity
on
the
bench
with
the
mace
and
seals
on
a
red
table
below
him
and
an
immense
flat
nosegay
like
a
little
garden
which
scented
the
whole
court
below
the
table
again
was
a
long
row
of
solicitors
with
bundles
of
papers
on
the
matting
at
their
feet
and
then
there
were
the
gentlemen
of
the
bar
in
wigs
and
gowns
some
awake
and
some
asleep
and
one
talking
and
nobody
paying
much
attention
to
what
he
said
the
lord
chancellor
leaned
back
in
his
very
easy
chair
with
his
elbow
on
the
cushioned
arm
and
his
forehead
resting
on
his
hand
some
of
those
who
were
present
dozed
some
read
the
newspapers
some
walked
about
or
whispered
in
groups
all
seemed
perfectly
at
their
ease
by
no
means
in
a
hurry
very
unconcerned
and
extremely
comfortable
to
see
everything
going
on
so
smoothly
and
to
think
of
the
roughness
of
the
suitors
lives
and
deaths
to
see
all
that
full
dress
and
ceremony
and
to
think
of
the
waste
and
want
and
beggared
misery
it
represented
to
consider
that
while
the
sickness
of
hope
deferred
was
raging
in
so
many
hearts
this
polite
show
went
calmly
on
from
day
to
day
and
year
to
year
in
such
good
order
and
composure
to
behold
the
lord
chancellor
and
the
whole
array
of
practitioners
under
him
looking
at
one
another
and
at
the
spectators
as
if
nobody
had
ever
heard
that
all
over
england
the
name
in
which
they
were
assembled
was
a
bitter
jest
was
held
in
universal
horror
contempt
and
indignation
was
known
for
something
so
flagrant
and
bad
that
little
short
of
a
miracle
could
bring
any
good
out
of
it
to
any
one
this
was
so
curious
and
to
me
who
had
no
experience
of
it
that
it
was
at
first
incredible
and
i
could
not
comprehend
it
i
sat
where
richard
put
me
and
tried
to
listen
and
looked
about
me
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
reality
in
the
whole
scene
except
poor
little
miss
flite
the
madwoman
standing
on
a
bench
and
nodding
at
it
miss
flite
soon
espied
us
and
came
to
where
we
sat
she
gave
me
a
gracious
welcome
to
her
domain
and
indicated
with
much
gratification
and
pride
its
principal
attractions
kenge
also
came
to
speak
to
us
and
did
the
honours
of
the
place
in
much
the
same
way
with
the
bland
modesty
of
a
proprietor
it
was
not
a
very
good
day
for
a
visit
he
said
he
would
have
preferred
the
first
day
of
term
but
it
was
imposing
it
was
imposing
when
we
had
been
there
half
an
hour
or
so
the
case
in
progress
if
i
may
use
a
phrase
so
ridiculous
in
such
a
connexion
seemed
to
die
out
of
its
own
vapidity
without
coming
or
being
by
anybody
expected
to
come
to
any
result
the
lord
chancellor
then
threw
down
a
bundle
of
papers
from
his
desk
to
the
gentlemen
below
him
and
somebody
said
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
upon
this
there
was
a
buzz
and
a
laugh
and
a
general
withdrawal
of
the
bystanders
and
a
bringing
in
of
great
heaps
and
piles
and
bags
and
bags
full
of
papers
i
think
it
came
on
for
further
directions
about
some
bill
of
costs
to
the
best
of
my
understanding
which
was
confused
enough
but
i
counted
gentlemen
in
wigs
who
said
they
were
in
it
and
none
of
them
appeared
to
understand
it
much
better
than
i
they
chatted
about
it
with
the
lord
chancellor
and
contradicted
and
explained
among
themselves
and
some
of
them
said
it
was
this
way
and
some
of
them
said
it
was
that
way
and
some
of
them
jocosely
proposed
to
read
huge
volumes
of
affidavits
and
there
was
more
buzzing
and
laughing
and
everybody
concerned
was
in
a
state
of
idle
entertainment
and
nothing
could
be
made
of
it
by
anybody
after
an
hour
or
so
of
this
and
a
good
many
speeches
being
begun
and
cut
short
it
was
referred
back
for
the
present
as
kenge
said
and
the
papers
were
bundled
up
again
before
the
clerks
had
finished
bringing
them
in
i
glanced
at
richard
on
the
termination
of
these
hopeless
proceedings
and
was
shocked
to
see
the
worn
look
of
his
handsome
young
face
it
ca
last
for
ever
dame
durden
better
luck
next
time
was
all
he
said
i
had
seen
guppy
bringing
in
papers
and
arranging
them
for
kenge
and
he
had
seen
me
and
made
me
a
forlorn
bow
which
rendered
me
desirous
to
get
out
of
the
court
richard
had
given
me
his
arm
and
was
taking
me
away
when
guppy
came
up
i
beg
your
pardon
carstone
said
he
in
a
whisper
and
miss
summerson
also
but
there
a
lady
here
a
friend
of
mine
who
knows
her
and
wishes
to
have
the
pleasure
of
shaking
hands
as
he
spoke
i
saw
before
me
as
if
she
had
started
into
bodily
shape
from
my
remembrance
rachael
of
my
godmother
house
how
do
you
do
esther
said
she
do
you
recollect
me
i
gave
her
my
hand
and
told
her
yes
and
that
she
was
very
little
altered
i
wonder
you
remember
those
times
esther
she
returned
with
her
old
asperity
they
are
changed
now
well
i
am
glad
to
see
you
and
glad
you
are
not
too
proud
to
know
me
but
indeed
she
seemed
disappointed
that
i
was
not
proud
mrs
rachael
i
remonstrated
i
am
married
esther
she
returned
coldly
correcting
me
and
am
chadband
well
i
wish
you
good
day
and
i
hope
you
do
well
guppy
who
had
been
attentive
to
this
short
dialogue
heaved
a
sigh
in
my
ear
and
elbowed
his
own
and
rachael
way
through
the
confused
little
crowd
of
people
coming
in
and
going
out
which
we
were
in
the
midst
of
and
which
the
change
in
the
business
had
brought
together
richard
and
i
were
making
our
way
through
it
and
i
was
yet
in
the
first
chill
of
the
late
unexpected
recognition
when
i
saw
coming
towards
us
but
not
seeing
us
no
less
a
person
than
george
he
made
nothing
of
the
people
about
him
as
he
tramped
on
staring
over
their
heads
into
the
body
of
the
court
george
said
richard
as
i
called
his
attention
to
him
you
are
well
met
sir
he
returned
and
you
miss
could
you
point
a
person
out
for
me
i
want
i
do
understand
these
places
turning
as
he
spoke
and
making
an
easy
way
for
us
he
stopped
when
we
were
out
of
the
press
in
a
corner
behind
a
great
red
curtain
there
a
little
cracked
old
woman
he
began
that
i
put
up
my
finger
for
miss
flite
was
close
by
me
having
kept
beside
me
all
the
time
and
having
called
the
attention
of
several
of
her
legal
acquaintance
to
me
as
i
had
overheard
to
my
confusion
by
whispering
in
their
ears
hush
fitz
jarndyce
on
my
left
hem
said
george
you
remember
miss
that
we
passed
some
conversation
on
a
certain
man
this
morning
gridley
in
a
low
whisper
behind
his
hand
yes
said
i
he
is
hiding
at
my
place
i
could
mention
it
had
his
authority
he
is
on
his
last
march
miss
and
has
a
whim
to
see
her
he
says
they
can
feel
for
one
another
and
she
has
been
almost
as
good
as
a
friend
to
him
here
i
came
down
to
look
for
her
for
when
i
sat
by
gridley
this
afternoon
i
seemed
to
hear
the
roll
of
the
muffled
drums
shall
i
tell
her
said
i
would
you
be
so
good
he
returned
with
a
glance
of
something
like
apprehension
at
miss
flite
it
a
providence
i
met
you
miss
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
known
how
to
get
on
with
that
lady
and
he
put
one
hand
in
his
breast
and
stood
upright
in
a
martial
attitude
as
i
informed
little
miss
flite
in
her
ear
of
the
purport
of
his
kind
errand
my
angry
friend
from
shropshire
almost
as
celebrated
as
myself
she
exclaimed
now
really
my
dear
i
will
wait
upon
him
with
the
greatest
pleasure
he
is
living
concealed
at
george
said
i
hush
this
is
mr
george
in
deed
returned
miss
flite
very
proud
to
have
the
honour
a
military
man
my
dear
you
know
a
perfect
general
she
whispered
to
me
poor
miss
flite
deemed
it
necessary
to
be
so
courtly
and
polite
as
a
mark
of
her
respect
for
the
army
and
to
curtsy
so
very
often
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
her
out
of
the
court
when
this
was
at
last
done
and
addressing
george
as
general
she
gave
him
her
arm
to
the
great
entertainment
of
some
idlers
who
were
looking
on
he
was
so
discomposed
and
begged
me
so
respectfully
not
to
desert
him
that
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
especially
as
miss
flite
was
always
tractable
with
me
and
as
she
too
said
fitz
jarndyce
my
dear
you
will
accompany
us
of
course
as
richard
seemed
quite
willing
and
even
anxious
that
we
should
see
them
safely
to
their
destination
we
agreed
to
do
so
and
as
george
informed
us
that
gridley
mind
had
run
on
jarndyce
all
the
afternoon
after
hearing
of
their
interview
in
the
morning
i
wrote
a
hasty
note
in
pencil
to
my
guardian
to
say
where
we
were
gone
and
why
george
sealed
it
at
a
that
it
might
lead
to
no
discovery
and
we
sent
it
off
by
a
we
then
took
a
and
drove
away
to
the
neighbourhood
of
leicester
square
we
walked
through
some
narrow
courts
for
which
george
apologized
and
soon
came
to
the
shooting
gallery
the
door
of
which
was
closed
as
he
pulled
a
which
hung
by
a
chain
to
the
a
very
respectable
old
gentleman
with
grey
hair
wearing
spectacles
and
dressed
in
a
black
spencer
and
gaiters
and
a
hat
and
carrying
a
large
cane
addressed
him
i
ask
your
pardon
my
good
friend
said
he
but
is
this
shooting
gallery
it
is
sir
returned
george
glancing
up
at
the
great
letters
in
which
that
inscription
was
painted
on
the
whitewashed
wall
oh
to
be
sure
said
the
old
gentleman
following
his
eyes
thank
you
have
you
rung
the
bell
my
name
is
george
sir
and
i
have
rung
the
bell
oh
indeed
said
the
old
gentleman
your
name
is
george
then
i
am
here
as
soon
as
you
you
see
you
came
for
me
no
doubt
no
sir
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
oh
indeed
said
the
old
gentleman
then
it
was
your
young
man
who
came
for
me
i
am
a
physician
and
was
requested
five
minutes
ago
to
come
and
visit
a
sick
man
at
george
shooting
gallery
the
muffled
drums
said
george
turning
to
richard
and
me
and
gravely
shaking
his
head
it
quite
correct
sir
will
you
please
to
walk
in
the
door
being
at
that
moment
opened
by
a
very
little
man
in
a
cap
and
apron
whose
face
and
hands
and
dress
were
blackened
all
over
we
passed
along
a
dreary
passage
into
a
large
building
with
bare
brick
walls
where
there
were
targets
and
guns
and
swords
and
other
things
of
that
kind
when
we
had
all
arrived
here
the
physician
stopped
and
taking
off
his
hat
appeared
to
vanish
by
magic
and
to
leave
another
and
quite
a
different
man
in
his
place
now
lookee
here
george
said
the
man
turning
quickly
round
upon
him
and
tapping
him
on
the
breast
with
a
large
forefinger
you
know
me
and
i
know
you
you
a
man
of
the
world
and
i
a
man
of
the
world
my
name
bucket
as
you
are
aware
and
i
have
got
a
against
gridley
you
have
kept
him
out
of
the
way
a
long
time
and
you
have
been
artful
in
it
and
it
does
you
credit
george
looking
hard
at
him
bit
his
lip
and
shook
his
head
now
george
said
the
other
keeping
close
to
him
you
a
sensible
man
and
a
man
that
what
you
are
beyond
a
doubt
and
mind
you
i
do
talk
to
you
as
a
common
character
because
you
have
served
your
country
and
you
know
that
when
duty
calls
we
must
obey
consequently
you
very
far
from
wanting
to
give
trouble
if
i
required
assistance
you
assist
me
that
what
do
phil
squod
do
you
go
round
the
gallery
like
that
the
dirty
little
man
was
shuffling
about
with
his
shoulder
against
the
wall
and
his
eyes
on
the
intruder
in
a
manner
that
looked
threatening
because
i
know
you
and
wo
have
it
phil
said
george
yes
be
quiet
the
little
man
with
a
low
growl
stood
still
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
bucket
you
excuse
anything
that
may
appear
to
be
disagreeable
in
this
for
my
name
inspector
bucket
of
the
detective
and
i
have
a
duty
to
perform
george
i
know
where
my
man
is
because
i
was
on
the
roof
last
night
and
saw
him
through
the
skylight
and
you
along
with
him
he
is
in
there
you
know
pointing
that
where
he
is
on
a
sofy
now
i
must
see
my
man
and
i
must
tell
my
man
to
consider
himself
in
custody
but
you
know
me
and
you
know
i
do
want
to
take
any
uncomfortable
measures
you
give
me
your
word
as
from
one
man
to
another
and
an
old
soldier
mind
you
likewise
that
it
honourable
between
us
two
and
accommodate
you
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
i
give
it
was
the
reply
but
it
was
handsome
in
you
mr
bucket
gammon
george
not
handsome
said
bucket
tapping
him
on
his
broad
breast
again
and
shaking
hands
with
him
i
do
say
it
handsome
in
you
to
keep
my
man
so
close
do
i
be
equally
to
me
old
boy
old
william
tell
old
shaw
the
life
guardsman
why
he
a
model
of
the
whole
british
army
in
himself
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
give
a
note
to
be
such
a
figure
of
a
man
the
affair
being
brought
to
this
head
george
after
a
little
consideration
proposed
to
go
in
first
to
his
comrade
as
he
called
him
taking
miss
flite
with
him
bucket
agreeing
they
went
away
to
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
leaving
us
sitting
and
standing
by
a
table
covered
with
guns
bucket
took
this
opportunity
of
entering
into
a
little
light
conversation
asking
me
if
i
were
afraid
of
as
most
young
ladies
were
asking
richard
if
he
were
a
good
shot
asking
phil
squod
which
he
considered
the
best
of
those
rifles
and
what
it
might
be
worth
telling
him
in
return
that
it
was
a
pity
he
ever
gave
way
to
his
temper
for
he
was
naturally
so
amiable
that
he
might
have
been
a
young
woman
and
making
himself
generally
agreeable
after
a
time
he
followed
us
to
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
and
richard
and
i
were
going
quietly
away
when
george
came
after
us
he
said
that
if
we
had
no
objection
to
see
his
comrade
he
would
take
a
visit
from
us
very
kindly
the
words
had
hardly
passed
his
lips
when
the
bell
was
rung
and
my
guardian
appeared
on
the
chance
he
slightly
observed
of
being
able
to
do
any
little
thing
for
a
poor
fellow
involved
in
the
same
misfortune
as
himself
we
all
four
went
back
together
and
went
into
the
place
where
gridley
was
it
was
a
bare
room
partitioned
off
from
the
gallery
with
unpainted
wood
as
the
screening
was
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
feet
high
and
only
enclosed
the
sides
not
the
top
the
rafters
of
the
high
gallery
roof
were
overhead
and
the
skylight
through
which
bucket
had
looked
down
the
sun
was
low
near
setting
and
its
light
came
redly
in
above
without
descending
to
the
ground
upon
a
plain
sofa
lay
the
man
from
shropshire
dressed
much
as
we
had
seen
him
last
but
so
changed
that
at
first
i
recognized
no
likeness
in
his
colourless
face
to
what
i
recollected
he
had
been
still
writing
in
his
and
still
dwelling
on
his
grievances
hour
after
hour
a
table
and
some
shelves
were
covered
with
manuscript
papers
and
with
worn
pens
and
a
medley
of
such
tokens
touchingly
and
awfully
drawn
together
he
and
the
little
mad
woman
were
side
by
side
and
as
it
were
alone
she
sat
on
a
chair
holding
his
hand
and
none
of
us
went
close
to
them
his
voice
had
faded
with
the
old
expression
of
his
face
with
his
strength
with
his
anger
with
his
resistance
to
the
wrongs
that
had
at
last
subdued
him
the
faintest
shadow
of
an
object
full
of
form
and
colour
is
such
a
picture
of
it
as
he
was
of
the
man
from
shropshire
whom
we
had
spoken
with
before
he
inclined
his
head
to
richard
and
me
and
spoke
to
my
guardian
jarndyce
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
i
am
not
long
to
be
seen
i
think
i
am
very
glad
to
take
your
hand
sir
you
are
a
good
man
superior
to
injustice
and
god
knows
i
honour
you
they
shook
hands
earnestly
and
my
guardian
said
some
words
of
comfort
to
him
it
may
seem
strange
to
you
sir
returned
gridley
i
should
not
have
liked
to
see
you
if
this
had
been
the
first
time
of
our
meeting
but
you
know
i
made
a
fight
for
it
you
know
i
stood
up
with
my
single
hand
against
them
all
you
know
i
told
them
the
truth
to
the
last
and
told
them
what
they
were
and
what
they
had
done
to
me
so
i
do
mind
your
seeing
me
this
wreck
you
have
been
courageous
with
them
many
and
many
a
time
returned
my
guardian
sir
i
have
been
with
a
faint
smile
i
told
you
what
would
come
of
it
when
i
ceased
to
be
so
and
see
here
look
at
us
look
at
us
he
drew
the
hand
miss
flite
held
through
her
arm
and
brought
her
something
nearer
to
him
this
ends
it
of
all
my
old
associations
of
all
my
old
pursuits
and
hopes
of
all
the
living
and
the
dead
world
this
one
poor
soul
alone
comes
natural
to
me
and
i
am
fit
for
there
is
a
tie
of
many
suffering
years
between
us
two
and
it
is
the
only
tie
i
ever
had
on
earth
that
chancery
has
not
broken
accept
my
blessing
gridley
said
miss
flite
in
tears
accept
my
blessing
i
thought
boastfully
that
they
never
could
break
my
heart
jarndyce
i
was
resolved
that
they
should
not
i
did
believe
that
i
could
and
would
charge
them
with
being
the
mockery
they
were
until
i
died
of
some
bodily
disorder
but
i
am
worn
out
how
long
i
have
been
wearing
out
i
do
know
i
seemed
to
break
down
in
an
hour
i
hope
they
may
never
come
to
hear
of
it
i
hope
everybody
here
will
lead
them
to
believe
that
i
died
defying
them
consistently
and
perseveringly
as
i
did
through
so
many
years
here
bucket
who
was
sitting
in
a
corner
by
the
door
offered
such
consolation
as
he
could
administer
come
come
he
said
from
his
corner
do
go
on
in
that
way
gridley
you
are
only
a
little
low
we
are
all
of
us
a
little
low
sometimes
i
am
hold
up
hold
up
you
lose
your
temper
with
the
whole
round
of
again
and
again
and
i
shall
take
you
on
a
score
of
warrants
yet
if
i
have
luck
he
only
shook
his
head
do
shake
your
head
said
bucket
nod
it
that
what
i
want
to
see
you
do
why
lord
bless
your
soul
what
times
we
have
had
together
have
i
seen
you
in
the
fleet
over
and
over
again
for
contempt
have
i
come
into
court
twenty
afternoons
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
see
you
pin
the
chancellor
like
a
do
you
remember
when
you
first
began
to
threaten
the
lawyers
and
the
peace
was
sworn
against
you
two
or
three
times
a
week
ask
the
little
old
lady
there
she
has
been
always
present
hold
up
gridley
hold
up
sir
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
him
asked
george
in
a
low
voice
i
do
know
yet
said
bucket
in
the
same
tone
then
resuming
his
encouragement
he
pursued
aloud
worn
out
gridley
after
dodging
me
for
all
these
weeks
and
forcing
me
to
climb
the
roof
here
like
a
tom
cat
and
to
come
to
see
you
as
a
doctor
that
ai
like
being
worn
out
i
should
think
not
now
i
tell
you
what
you
want
you
want
excitement
you
know
to
keep
you
up
that
what
you
want
you
used
to
it
and
you
ca
do
without
it
i
could
myself
very
well
then
here
this
warrant
got
by
tulkinghorn
of
lincoln
inn
fields
and
backed
into
counties
since
what
do
you
say
to
coming
along
with
me
upon
this
warrant
and
having
a
good
angry
argument
before
the
magistrates
it
do
you
good
it
freshen
you
up
and
get
you
into
training
for
another
turn
at
the
chancellor
give
in
why
i
am
surprised
to
hear
a
man
of
your
energy
talk
of
giving
in
you
must
do
that
you
half
the
fun
of
the
fair
in
the
court
of
chancery
george
you
lend
gridley
a
hand
and
let
see
now
whether
he
wo
be
better
up
than
down
he
is
very
weak
said
the
trooper
in
a
low
voice
is
he
returned
bucket
anxiously
i
only
want
to
rouse
him
i
do
like
to
see
an
old
acquaintance
giving
in
like
this
it
would
cheer
him
up
more
than
anything
if
i
could
make
him
a
little
waxy
with
me
he
welcome
to
drop
into
me
right
and
left
if
he
likes
i
shall
never
take
advantage
of
it
the
roof
rang
with
a
scream
from
miss
flite
which
still
rings
in
my
ears
oh
no
gridley
she
cried
as
he
fell
heavily
and
calmly
back
from
before
her
not
without
my
blessing
after
so
many
years
the
sun
was
down
the
light
had
gradually
stolen
from
the
roof
and
the
shadow
had
crept
upward
but
to
me
the
shadow
of
that
pair
one
living
and
one
dead
fell
heavier
on
richard
departure
than
the
darkness
of
the
darkest
night
and
through
richard
farewell
words
i
heard
it
echoed
of
all
my
old
associations
of
all
my
old
pursuits
and
hopes
of
all
the
living
and
the
dead
world
this
one
poor
soul
alone
comes
natural
to
me
and
i
am
fit
for
there
is
a
tie
of
many
suffering
years
between
us
two
and
it
is
the
only
tie
i
ever
had
on
earth
that
chancery

not
broken
chapter
xxv
snagsby
sees
it
all
there
is
disquietude
in
cook
court
cursitor
street
black
suspicion
hides
in
that
peaceful
region
the
mass
of
cook
courtiers
are
in
their
usual
state
of
mind
no
better
and
no
worse
but
snagsby
is
changed
and
his
little
woman
knows
it
for
and
lincoln
inn
fields
persist
in
harnessing
themselves
a
pair
of
ungovernable
coursers
to
the
chariot
of
snagsby
imagination
and
bucket
drives
and
the
passengers
are
jo
and
tulkinghorn
and
the
complete
equipage
whirls
though
the
business
at
wild
speed
all
round
the
clock
even
in
the
little
front
kitchen
where
the
family
meals
are
taken
it
rattles
away
at
a
smoking
pace
from
the
when
snagsby
pauses
in
carving
the
first
slice
of
the
leg
of
mutton
baked
with
potatoes
and
stares
at
the
kitchen
wall
snagsby
can
not
make
out
what
it
is
that
he
has
had
to
do
with
something
is
wrong
somewhere
but
what
something
what
may
come
of
it
to
whom
when
and
from
which
unthought
of
and
unheard
of
quarter
is
the
puzzle
of
his
life
his
remote
impressions
of
the
robes
and
coronets
the
stars
and
garters
that
sparkle
through
the
of
tulkinghorn
chambers
his
veneration
for
the
mysteries
presided
over
by
that
best
and
closest
of
his
customers
whom
all
the
inns
of
court
all
chancery
lane
and
all
the
legal
neighbourhood
agree
to
hold
in
awe
his
remembrance
of
detective
bucket
with
his
forefinger
and
his
confidential
manner
impossible
to
be
evaded
or
declined
persuade
him
that
he
is
a
party
to
some
dangerous
secret
without
knowing
what
it
is
and
it
is
the
fearful
peculiarity
of
this
condition
that
at
any
hour
of
his
daily
life
at
any
opening
of
the
at
any
pull
of
the
bell
at
any
entrance
of
a
messenger
or
any
delivery
of
a
letter
the
secret
may
take
air
and
fire
explode
and
blow
up
bucket
only
knows
whom
for
which
reason
whenever
a
man
unknown
comes
into
the
shop
as
many
men
unknown
do
and
says
is
snagsby
in
or
words
to
that
innocent
effect
snagsby
heart
knocks
hard
at
his
guilty
breast
he
undergoes
so
much
from
such
inquiries
that
when
they
are
made
by
boys
he
revenges
himself
by
flipping
at
their
ears
over
the
counter
and
asking
the
young
dogs
what
they
mean
by
it
and
why
they
ca
speak
out
at
once
more
impracticable
men
and
boys
persist
in
walking
into
snagsby
sleep
and
terrifying
him
with
unaccountable
questions
so
that
often
when
the
cock
at
the
little
dairy
in
cursitor
street
breaks
out
in
his
usual
absurd
way
about
the
morning
snagsby
finds
himself
in
a
crisis
of
nightmare
with
his
little
woman
shaking
him
and
saying
what
the
matter
with
the
man
the
little
woman
herself
is
not
the
least
item
in
his
difficulty
to
know
that
he
is
always
keeping
a
secret
from
her
that
he
has
under
all
circumstances
to
conceal
and
hold
fast
a
tender
double
tooth
which
her
sharpness
is
ever
ready
to
twist
out
of
his
head
gives
snagsby
in
her
dentistical
presence
much
of
the
air
of
a
dog
who
has
a
reservation
from
his
master
and
will
look
anywhere
rather
than
meet
his
eye
these
various
signs
and
tokens
marked
by
the
little
woman
are
not
lost
upon
her
they
impel
her
to
say
snagsby
has
something
on
his
mind
and
thus
suspicion
gets
into
cook
court
cursitor
street
from
suspicion
to
jealousy
snagsby
finds
the
road
as
natural
and
short
as
from
cook
court
to
chancery
lane
and
thus
jealousy
gets
into
cook
court
cursitor
street
once
there
and
it
was
always
lurking
thereabout
it
is
very
active
and
nimble
in
snagsby
breast
prompting
her
to
nocturnal
examinations
of
snagsby
pockets
to
secret
perusals
of
snagsby
letters
to
private
researches
in
the
day
book
and
ledger
till
and
iron
safe
to
watchings
at
windows
listenings
behind
doors
and
a
general
putting
of
this
and
that
together
by
the
wrong
end
snagsby
is
so
perpetually
on
the
alert
that
the
house
becomes
ghostly
with
creaking
boards
and
rustling
garments
the
think
somebody
may
have
been
murdered
there
in
bygone
times
guster
holds
certain
loose
atoms
of
an
idea
picked
up
at
tooting
where
they
were
found
floating
among
the
orphans
that
there
is
buried
money
underneath
the
cellar
guarded
by
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
who
can
not
get
out
for
seven
thousand
years
because
he
said
the
lord
prayer
backwards
who
was
nimrod
snagsby
repeatedly
inquires
of
herself
who
was
that
lady
that
creature
and
who
is
that
boy
now
nimrod
being
as
dead
as
the
mighty
hunter
whose
name
snagsby
has
appropriated
and
the
lady
being
unproducible
she
directs
her
mental
eye
for
the
present
with
redoubled
vigilance
to
the
boy
and
who
quoth
snagsby
for
the
thousand
and
first
time
is
that
boy
who
is
that
and
there
snagsby
is
seized
with
an
inspiration
he
has
no
respect
for
chadband
no
to
be
sure
and
he
have
of
course
naturally
he
would
under
those
contagious
circumstances
he
was
invited
and
appointed
by
chadband
why
snagsby
heard
it
herself
with
her
own
ears
to
come
back
and
be
told
where
he
was
to
go
to
be
addressed
by
chadband
and
he
never
came
why
did
he
never
come
because
he
was
told
not
to
come
who
told
him
not
to
come
who
ha
ha
snagsby
sees
it
all
but
happily
and
snagsby
tightly
shakes
her
head
and
tightly
smiles
that
boy
was
met
by
chadband
yesterday
in
the
streets
and
that
boy
as
affording
a
subject
which
chadband
desires
to
improve
for
the
spiritual
delight
of
a
select
congregation
was
seized
by
chadband
and
threatened
with
being
delivered
over
to
the
police
unless
he
showed
the
reverend
gentleman
where
he
lived
and
unless
he
entered
into
and
fulfilled
an
undertaking
to
appear
in
cook
court
night
to
mor
row
night
snagsby
repeats
for
mere
emphasis
with
another
tight
smile
and
another
tight
shake
of
her
head
and
night
that
boy
will
be
here
and
night
snagsby
will
have
her
eye
upon
him
and
upon
some
one
else
and
oh
you
may
walk
a
long
while
in
your
secret
ways
says
snagsby
with
haughtiness
and
scorn
but
you
ca
blind
me
snagsby
sounds
no
timbrel
in
anybody
ears
but
holds
her
purpose
quietly
and
keeps
her
counsel
comes
the
savoury
preparations
for
the
oil
trade
come
the
evening
comes
comes
snagsby
in
his
black
coat
come
the
chadbands
come
when
the
gorging
vessel
is
replete
the
and
guster
to
be
edified
comes
at
last
with
his
slouching
head
and
his
shuffle
backward
and
his
shuffle
forward
and
his
shuffle
to
the
right
and
his
shuffle
to
the
left
and
his
bit
of
fur
cap
in
his
muddy
hand
which
he
picks
as
if
it
were
some
mangy
bird
he
had
caught
and
was
plucking
before
eating
raw
jo
the
very
very
tough
subject
chadband
is
to
improve
snagsby
screws
a
watchful
glance
on
jo
as
he
is
brought
into
the
little
by
guster
he
looks
at
snagsby
the
moment
he
comes
in
aha
why
does
he
look
at
snagsby
snagsby
looks
at
him
why
should
he
do
that
but
that
snagsby
sees
it
all
why
else
should
that
look
pass
between
them
why
else
should
snagsby
be
confused
and
cough
a
signal
cough
behind
his
hand
it
is
as
clear
as
crystal
that
snagsby
is
that
boy
father
peace
my
friends
says
chadband
rising
and
wiping
the
oily
exudations
from
his
reverend
visage
peace
be
with
us
my
friends
why
with
us
because
with
his
fat
smile
it
can
not
be
against
us
because
it
must
be
for
us
because
it
is
not
hardening
because
it
is
softening
because
it
does
not
make
war
like
the
hawk
but
comes
home
unto
us
like
the
dove
therefore
my
friends
peace
be
with
us
my
human
boy
come
forward
stretching
forth
his
flabby
paw
chadband
lays
the
same
on
arm
and
considers
where
to
station
him
jo
very
doubtful
of
his
reverend
friend
intentions
and
not
at
all
clear
but
that
something
practical
and
painful
is
going
to
be
done
to
him
mutters
you
let
me
alone
i
never
said
nothink
to
you
you
let
me
alone
no
my
young
friend
says
chadband
smoothly
i
will
not
let
you
alone
and
why
because
i
am
a
because
i
am
a
toiler
and
a
moiler
because
you
are
delivered
over
unto
me
and
are
become
as
a
precious
instrument
in
my
hands
my
friends
may
i
so
employ
this
instrument
as
to
use
it
to
your
advantage
to
your
profit
to
your
gain
to
your
welfare
to
your
enrichment
my
young
friend
sit
upon
this
stool
jo
apparently
possessed
by
an
impression
that
the
reverend
gentleman
wants
to
cut
his
hair
shields
his
head
with
both
arms
and
is
got
into
the
required
position
with
great
difficulty
and
every
possible
manifestation
of
reluctance
when
he
is
at
last
adjusted
like
a
chadband
retiring
behind
the
table
holds
up
his
and
says
my
friends
this
is
the
signal
for
a
general
settlement
of
the
audience
the
giggle
internally
and
nudge
each
other
guster
falls
into
a
staring
and
vacant
state
compounded
of
a
stunned
admiration
of
chadband
and
pity
for
the
friendless
outcast
whose
condition
touches
her
nearly
snagsby
silently
lays
trains
of
gunpowder
chadband
composes
herself
grimly
by
the
fire
and
warms
her
knees
finding
that
sensation
favourable
to
the
reception
of
eloquence
it
happens
that
chadband
has
a
pulpit
habit
of
fixing
some
member
of
his
congregation
with
his
eye
and
fatly
arguing
his
points
with
that
particular
person
who
is
understood
to
be
expected
to
be
moved
to
an
occasional
grunt
groan
gasp
or
other
audible
expression
of
inward
working
which
expression
of
inward
working
being
echoed
by
some
elderly
lady
in
the
next
pew
and
so
communicated
like
a
game
of
forfeits
through
a
circle
of
the
more
fermentable
sinners
present
serves
the
purpose
of
parliamentary
cheering
and
gets
steam
up
from
mere
force
of
habit
chadband
in
saying
my
friends
has
rested
his
eye
on
snagsby
and
proceeds
to
make
that
stationer
already
sufficiently
confused
the
immediate
recipient
of
his
discourse
we
have
here
among
us
my
friends
says
chadband
a
gentile
and
a
heathen
a
dweller
in
the
tents
of
and
a
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
we
have
here
among
us
my
friends
and
chadband
untwisting
the
point
with
his
dirty
bestows
an
oily
smile
on
snagsby
signifying
that
he
will
throw
him
an
argumentative
presently
if
he
be
not
already
down
a
brother
and
a
boy
devoid
of
parents
devoid
of
relations
devoid
of
flocks
and
herds
devoid
of
gold
and
silver
and
of
precious
stones
now
my
friends
why
do
i
say
he
is
devoid
of
these
possessions
why
why
is
he
chadband
states
the
question
as
if
he
were
propounding
an
entirely
new
riddle
of
much
ingenuity
and
merit
to
snagsby
and
entreating
him
not
to
give
it
up
snagsby
greatly
perplexed
by
the
mysterious
look
he
received
just
now
from
his
little
woman
at
about
the
period
when
chadband
mentioned
the
word
parents
is
tempted
into
modestly
remarking
i
do
know
i
sure
sir
on
which
interruption
chadband
glares
and
snagsby
says
for
shame
i
hear
a
voice
says
chadband
is
it
a
still
small
voice
my
friends
i
fear
not
though
i
fain
would
hope
so
ah
h
from
snagsby
which
says
do
know
then
i
will
tell
you
why
i
say
this
brother
present
here
among
us
is
devoid
of
parents
devoid
of
relations
devoid
of
flocks
and
herds
devoid
of
gold
of
silver
and
of
precious
stones
because
he
is
devoid
of
the
light
that
shines
in
upon
some
of
us
what
is
that
light
what
is
it
i
ask
you
what
is
that
light
chadband
draws
back
his
head
and
pauses
but
snagsby
is
not
to
be
lured
on
to
his
destruction
again
chadband
leaning
forward
over
the
table
pierces
what
he
has
got
to
follow
directly
into
snagsby
with
the
already
mentioned
it
is
says
chadband
the
ray
of
rays
the
sun
of
suns
the
moon
of
moons
the
star
of
stars
it
is
the
light
of
terewth
chadband
draws
himself
up
again
and
looks
triumphantly
at
snagsby
as
if
he
would
be
glad
to
know
how
he
feels
after
that
of
terewth
says
chadband
hitting
him
again
say
not
to
me
that
it
is
not
the
lamp
of
lamps
i
say
to
you
it
is
i
say
to
you
a
million
of
times
over
it
is
it
is
i
say
to
you
that
i
will
proclaim
it
to
you
whether
you
like
it
or
not
nay
that
the
less
you
like
it
the
more
i
will
proclaim
it
to
you
with
a
i
say
to
you
that
if
you
rear
yourself
against
it
you
shall
fall
you
shall
be
bruised
you
shall
be
battered
you
shall
be
flawed
you
shall
be
smashed
the
present
effect
of
this
flight
of
oratory
much
admired
for
its
general
power
by
chadband
followers
being
not
only
to
make
chadband
unpleasantly
warm
but
to
represent
the
innocent
snagsby
in
the
light
of
a
determined
enemy
to
virtue
with
a
forehead
of
brass
and
a
heart
of
adamant
that
unfortunate
tradesman
becomes
yet
more
disconcerted
and
is
in
a
very
advanced
state
of
low
spirits
and
false
position
when
chadband
accidentally
finishes
him
my
friends
he
resumes
after
dabbing
his
fat
head
for
some
time
and
it
smokes
to
such
an
extent
that
he
seems
to
light
his
at
it
which
smokes
too
after
every
dab
to
pursue
the
subject
we
are
endeavouring
with
our
lowly
gifts
to
improve
let
us
in
a
spirit
of
love
inquire
what
is
that
terewth
to
which
i
have
alluded
for
my
young
friends
suddenly
addressing
the
and
guster
to
their
consternation
if
i
am
told
by
the
doctor
that
calomel
or
is
good
for
me
i
may
naturally
ask
what
is
calomel
and
what
is
i
may
wish
to
be
informed
of
that
before
i
dose
myself
with
either
or
with
both
now
my
young
friends
what
is
this
terewth
then
firstly
in
a
spirit
of
love
what
is
the
common
sort
of
terewth
the
working
clothes
the
wear
my
young
friends
is
it
deception
ah
h
from
snagsby
is
it
suppression
a
shiver
in
the
negative
from
snagsby
is
it
reservation
a
shake
of
the
head
from
snagsby
very
long
and
very
tight
no
my
friends
it
is
neither
of
these
neither
of
these
names
belongs
to
it
when
this
young
heathen
now
among
us
who
is
now
my
friends
asleep
the
seal
of
indifference
and
perdition
being
set
upon
his
eyelids
but
do
not
wake
him
for
it
is
right
that
i
should
have
to
wrestle
and
to
combat
and
to
struggle
and
to
conquer
for
his
sake
when
this
young
hardened
heathen
told
us
a
story
of
a
cock
and
of
a
bull
and
of
a
lady
and
of
a
sovereign
was
that
the
terewth
no
or
if
it
was
partly
was
it
wholly
and
entirely
no
my
friends
no
if
snagsby
could
withstand
his
little
woman
look
as
it
enters
at
his
eyes
the
windows
of
his
soul
and
searches
the
whole
tenement
he
were
other
than
the
man
he
is
he
cowers
and
droops
or
my
juvenile
friends
says
chadband
descending
to
the
level
of
their
comprehension
with
a
very
obtrusive
demonstration
in
his
greasily
meek
smile
of
coming
a
long
way
downstairs
for
the
purpose
if
the
master
of
this
house
was
to
go
forth
into
the
city
and
there
see
an
eel
and
was
to
come
back
and
was
to
call
unto
him
the
mistress
of
this
house
and
was
to
say
rejoice
with
me
for
i
have
seen
an
elephant
would
that
be
terewth
snagsby
in
tears
or
put
it
my
juvenile
friends
that
he
saw
an
elephant
and
returning
said
the
city
is
barren
i
have
seen
but
an
eel
would
that
be
terewth
snagsby
sobbing
loudly
or
put
it
my
juvenile
friends
said
chadband
stimulated
by
the
sound
that
the
unnatural
parents
of
this
slumbering
heathen
for
parents
he
had
my
juvenile
friends
beyond
a
doubt
after
casting
him
forth
to
the
wolves
and
the
vultures
and
the
wild
dogs
and
the
young
gazelles
and
the
serpents
went
back
to
their
dwellings
and
had
their
pipes
and
their
pots
and
their
flutings
and
their
dancings
and
their
malt
liquors
and
their
butcher
meat
and
poultry
would
that
be
terewth
snagsby
replies
by
delivering
herself
a
prey
to
spasms
not
an
unresisting
prey
but
a
crying
and
a
tearing
one
so
that
court
with
her
shrieks
finally
becoming
cataleptic
she
has
to
be
carried
up
the
narrow
staircase
like
a
grand
piano
after
unspeakable
suffering
productive
of
the
utmost
consternation
she
is
pronounced
by
expresses
from
the
bedroom
free
from
pain
though
much
exhausted
in
which
state
of
affairs
snagsby
trampled
and
crushed
in
the
removal
and
extremely
timid
and
feeble
ventures
to
come
out
from
behind
the
door
in
the
all
this
time
jo
has
been
standing
on
the
spot
where
he
woke
up
ever
picking
his
cap
and
putting
bits
of
fur
in
his
mouth
he
spits
them
out
with
a
remorseful
air
for
he
feels
that
it
is
in
his
nature
to
be
an
unimprovable
reprobate
and
that
it
no
good
his
trying
to
keep
awake
for
he
wo
never
know
nothink
though
it
may
be
jo
that
there
is
a
history
so
interesting
and
affecting
even
to
minds
as
near
the
brutes
as
thine
recording
deeds
done
on
this
earth
for
common
men
that
if
the
chadbands
removing
their
own
persons
from
the
light
would
but
show
it
thee
in
simple
reverence
would
but
leave
it
unimproved
would
but
regard
it
as
being
eloquent
enough
without
their
modest
aid
it
might
hold
thee
awake
and
thou
might
learn
from
it
yet
jo
never
heard
of
any
such
book
its
compilers
and
the
reverend
chadband
are
all
one
to
him
except
that
he
knows
the
reverend
chadband
and
would
rather
run
away
from
him
for
an
hour
than
hear
him
talk
for
five
minutes
it
a
no
good
my
waiting
here
no
longer
thinks
jo
snagsby
a
to
say
nothink
to
me
and
downstairs
he
shuffles
but
downstairs
is
the
charitable
guster
holding
by
the
handrail
of
the
kitchen
stairs
and
warding
off
a
fit
as
yet
doubtfully
the
same
having
been
induced
by
snagsby
screaming
she
has
her
own
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
to
hand
to
jo
with
whom
she
ventures
to
interchange
a
word
or
so
for
the
first
time
here
something
to
eat
poor
boy
says
guster
mum
says
jo
are
you
hungry
jist
says
jo
what
gone
of
your
father
and
your
mother
eh
jo
stops
in
the
middle
of
a
bite
and
looks
petrified
for
this
orphan
charge
of
the
christian
saint
whose
shrine
was
at
tooting
has
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
and
it
is
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
any
decent
hand
has
been
so
laid
upon
him
i
never
know
nothink
about
says
jo
no
more
did
i
of
mine
cries
guster
she
is
repressing
symptoms
favourable
to
the
fit
when
she
seems
to
take
alarm
at
something
and
vanishes
down
the
stairs
jo
whispers
the
softly
as
the
boy
lingers
on
the
step
here
i
am
mr
snagsby
i
did
know
you
were
gone
there
another
jo
it
was
quite
right
of
you
to
say
nothing
about
the
lady
the
other
night
when
we
were
out
together
it
would
breed
trouble
you
ca
be
too
quiet
jo
i
am
fly
master
and
so
good
night
a
ghostly
shade
frilled
and
follows
the
to
the
room
he
came
from
and
glides
higher
up
and
henceforth
he
begins
go
where
he
will
to
be
attended
by
another
shadow
than
his
own
hardly
less
constant
than
his
own
hardly
less
quiet
than
his
own

into
whatsoever
atmosphere
of
secrecy
his

shadow
may
pass
let
all
concerned
in
the
secrecy
beware

the
watchful

chapter
xxvi
sharpshooters
wintry
morning
looking
with
dull
eyes
and
sallow
face
upon
the
neighbourhood
of
leicester
square
finds
its
inhabitants
unwilling
to
get
out
of
bed
many
of
them
are
not
early
risers
at
the
brightest
of
times
being
birds
of
night
who
roost
when
the
sun
is
high
and
are
wide
awake
and
keen
for
prey
when
the
stars
shine
out
behind
dingy
blind
and
curtain
in
upper
story
and
garret
skulking
more
or
less
under
false
names
false
hair
false
titles
false
jewellery
and
false
histories
a
colony
of
brigands
lie
in
their
first
sleep
gentlemen
of
the
road
who
could
discourse
from
personal
experience
of
foreign
galleys
and
home
treadmills
spies
of
strong
governments
that
eternally
quake
with
weakness
and
miserable
fear
broken
traitors
cowards
bullies
gamesters
shufflers
swindlers
and
false
witnesses
some
not
unmarked
by
the
beneath
their
dirty
braid
all
with
more
cruelty
in
them
than
was
in
nero
and
more
crime
than
is
in
newgate
for
howsoever
bad
the
devil
can
be
in
fustian
or
and
he
can
be
very
bad
in
both
he
is
a
more
designing
callous
and
intolerable
devil
when
he
sticks
a
pin
in
his
calls
himself
a
gentleman
backs
a
card
or
colour
plays
a
game
or
so
of
billiards
and
knows
a
little
about
bills
and
promissory
notes
than
in
any
other
form
he
wears
and
in
such
form
bucket
shall
find
him
when
he
will
still
pervading
the
tributary
channels
of
leicester
square
but
the
wintry
morning
wants
him
not
and
wakes
him
not
it
wakes
george
of
the
shooting
gallery
and
his
familiar
they
arise
roll
up
and
stow
away
their
mattresses
george
having
shaved
himself
before
a
of
minute
proportions
then
marches
out
and
to
the
pump
in
the
little
yard
and
anon
comes
back
shining
with
yellow
soap
friction
drifting
rain
and
exceedingly
cold
water
as
he
rubs
himself
upon
a
large
blowing
like
a
military
sort
of
diver
just
come
up
his
hair
curling
tighter
and
tighter
on
his
sunburnt
temples
the
more
he
rubs
it
so
that
it
looks
as
if
it
never
could
be
loosened
by
any
less
coercive
instrument
than
an
iron
rake
or
a
as
he
rubs
and
puffs
and
polishes
and
blows
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
the
more
conveniently
to
excoriate
his
throat
and
standing
with
his
body
well
bent
forward
to
keep
the
wet
from
his
martial
legs
phil
on
his
knees
lighting
a
fire
looks
round
as
if
it
were
enough
washing
for
him
to
see
all
that
done
and
sufficient
renovation
for
one
day
to
take
in
the
superfluous
health
his
master
throws
off
when
george
is
dry
he
goes
to
work
to
brush
his
head
with
two
hard
brushes
at
once
to
that
unmerciful
degree
that
phil
shouldering
his
way
round
the
gallery
in
the
act
of
sweeping
it
winks
with
sympathy
this
chafing
over
the
ornamental
part
of
george
toilet
is
soon
performed
he
fills
his
pipe
lights
it
and
marches
up
and
down
smoking
as
his
custom
is
while
phil
raising
a
powerful
odour
of
hot
rolls
and
coffee
prepares
breakfast
he
smokes
gravely
and
marches
in
slow
time
perhaps
this
morning
pipe
is
devoted
to
the
memory
of
gridley
in
his
grave
and
so
phil
says
george
of
the
shooting
gallery
after
several
turns
in
silence
you
were
dreaming
of
the
country
last
night
phil
by
the
by
said
as
much
in
a
tone
of
surprise
as
he
scrambled
out
of
bed
yes
what
was
it
like
i
hardly
know
what
it
was
like
said
phil
considering
how
did
you
know
it
was
the
country
on
account
of
the
grass
i
think
and
the
swans
upon
it
says
phil
after
further
consideration
what
were
the
swans
doing
on
the
grass
they
was
of
it
i
expect
says
phil
the
master
resumes
his
march
and
the
man
resumes
his
preparation
of
breakfast
it
is
not
necessarily
a
lengthened
preparation
being
limited
to
the
setting
forth
of
very
simple
breakfast
requisites
for
two
and
the
broiling
of
a
rasher
of
bacon
at
the
fire
in
the
rusty
grate
but
as
phil
has
to
sidle
round
a
considerable
part
of
the
gallery
for
every
object
he
wants
and
never
brings
two
objects
at
once
it
takes
time
under
the
circumstances
at
length
the
breakfast
is
ready
phil
announcing
it
george
knocks
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
on
the
hob
stands
his
pipe
itself
in
the
chimney
corner
and
sits
down
to
the
meal
when
he
has
helped
himself
phil
follows
suit
sitting
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
little
oblong
table
and
taking
his
plate
on
his
knees
either
in
humility
or
to
hide
his
blackened
hands
or
because
it
is
his
natural
manner
of
eating
the
country
says
george
plying
his
knife
and
fork
why
i
suppose
you
never
clapped
your
eyes
on
the
country
phil
i
see
the
marshes
once
says
phil
contentedly
eating
his
breakfast
what
marshes
the
marshes
commander
returns
phil
where
are
they
i
do
know
where
they
are
says
phil
but
i
see
they
was
flat
and
miste
governor
and
commander
are
interchangeable
terms
with
phil
expressive
of
the
same
respect
and
deference
and
applicable
to
nobody
but
george
i
was
born
in
the
country
phil
was
you
indeed
commander
yes
and
bred
there
phil
elevates
his
one
eyebrow
and
after
respectfully
staring
at
his
master
to
express
interest
swallows
a
great
gulp
of
coffee
still
staring
at
him
there
not
a
bird
note
that
i
do
know
says
george
not
many
an
english
leaf
or
berry
that
i
could
name
not
many
a
tree
that
i
could
climb
yet
if
i
was
put
to
it
i
was
a
real
country
boy
once
my
good
mother
lived
in
the
country

must
have
been
a
fine
old
lady
phil
observes
aye
and
not
so
old
either
five
and
thirty
years
ago
says
george
but
i
wager
that
at
ninety
she
would
be
near
as
upright
as
me
and
near
as
broad
across
the
shoulders
did
she
die
at
ninety
inquires
phil
no
bosh
let
her
rest
in
peace
god
bless
her
says
the
trooper
what
set
me
on
about
country
boys
and
runaways
and
you
to
be
sure
so
you
never
clapped
your
eyes
upon
the
country
marshes
and
dreams

shakes
his
head

enough
for
you

phil

i
doubt

old

phil
asks
the
trooper
pausing
as
he
conveys
his
smoking
saucer
to
his
lips
i
something
with
a
eight
in
it
says
phil
it
ca
be
eighty
nor
yet
eighteen
it
betwixt
somewheres
george
slowly
putting
down
his
saucer
without
tasting
its
contents
is
laughingly
beginning
why
what
the
deuce
phil
when
he
stops
seeing
that
phil
is
counting
on
his
dirty
fingers
i
was
just
eight
says
phil
agreeable
to
the
parish
calculation
when
i
went
with
the
tinker
i
was
sent
on
a
errand
and
i
see
him
under
a
old
buildin
with
a
fire

to
himself
wery
comfortable
and
he
says

says
george
resuming
his
breakfast
and
where
the
tinker
drink
put
him
in
the
hospital
and
the
hospital
put
him
in
a
i
have
heerd
phil
replies
mysteriously
by
that
means
you
got
promotion
took
the
business
phil
yes
commander
i
took
the
business
such
as
it
was
it
was
much
of
a
beat
round
saffron
hill
hatton
garden
clerkenwell
smiffeld
and
there
poor
neighbourhood
where
they
uses
up
the
kettles
till
they
past
mending
most
of
the
tramping
tinkers
used
to
come
and
lodge
at
our
place
that
was
the
best
part
of
my
master
earnings
but
they
did
come
to
me
i
war
like
him
he
could
sing
a
good
song
i
could
he
could
play
a
tune
on
any
sort
of
pot
you
please
so
as
it
was
iron
or
block
tin
i
never
could
do
nothing
with
a
pot
but
mend
it
or
bile
it
never
had
a
note
of
music
in
me
besides
i
was
too
and
their
wives
complained
of
me
they
were
mighty
particular
you
would
pass
muster
in
a
crowd
phil
says
the
trooper
with
a
pleasant
smile
no
returns
phil
shaking
his
head
no
i
should
i
was
passable
enough
when
i
went
with
the
tinker
though
nothing
to
boast
of
then
but
what
with
blowing
the
fire
with
my
mouth
when
i
was
young
and
spileing
my
complexion
and
singeing
my
hair
off
and
swallering
the
smoke
and
what
with
being
in
the
way
of
running
against
hot
metal
and
marking
myself
by
sich
means
and
what
with
having
with
the
tinker
as
i
got
older
almost
whenever
he
was
too
far
gone
in
drink
which
was
almost
always
my
beauty
was
queer
wery
queer
even
at
that
time
as
to
since
what
with
a
dozen
years
in
a
dark
forge
where
the
men
was
given
to
larking
and
what
with
being
scorched
in
a
accident
at
a
and
what
with
being
blowed
out
of
winder
at
the
firework
business
i
am
ugly
enough
to
be
made
a
show
on
resigning
himself
to
which
condition
with
a
perfectly
satisfied
manner
phil
begs
the
favour
of
another
cup
of
coffee
while
drinking
it
he
says
it
was
after
the
when
i
first
see
you
commander
you
remember
i
remember
phil
you
were
walking
along
in
the
sun
crawling
again
a
wall
true
phil
shouldering
your
way
on
in
a
exclaims
phil
excited
in
a
and
hobbling
with
a
couple
of
sticks
cries
phil
still
more
excited
with
a
couple
of
sticks
when
when
you
stops
you
know
cries
phil
putting
down
his
cup
and
saucer
and
hastily
removing
his
plate
from
his
knees
and
says
to
me
comrade
you
have
been
in
the
wars
i
did
say
much
to
you
commander
then
for
i
was
took
by
surprise
that
a
person
so
strong
and
healthy
and
bold
as
you
was
should
stop
to
speak
to
such
a
limping
bag
of
bones
as
i
was
but
you
says
to
me
says
you
delivering
it
out
of
your
chest
as
hearty
as
possible
so
that
it
was
like
a
glass
of
something
hot
accident
have
you
met
with
you
have
been
badly
hurt
what
amiss
old
boy
cheer
up
and
tell
us
about
it
cheer
up
i
was
cheered
already
i
says
as
much
to
you
you
says
more
to
me
i
says
more
to
you
you
says
more
to
me
and
here
i
am
commander
here
i
am
commander
cries
phil
who
has
started
from
his
chair
and
unaccountably
begun
to
sidle
away
if
a
mark
wanted
or
if
it
will
improve
the
business
let
the
customers
take
aim
at
me
they
ca
spoil
my
beauty
i
all
right
come
on
if
they
want
a
man
to
box
at
let
box
at
me
let
knock
me
well
about
the
head
i
do
mind
if
they
want
a
to
be
throwed
for
practice
cornwall
devonshire
or
lancashire
let
throw
me
they
wo
hurt
me
i
have
been
throwed
all
sorts
of
styles
all
my
life
with
this
unexpected
speech
energetically
delivered
and
accompanied
by
action
illustrative
of
the
various
exercises
referred
to
phil
squod
shoulders
his
way
round
three
sides
of
the
gallery
and
abruptly
tacking
off
at
his
commander
makes
a
butt
at
him
with
his
head
intended
to
express
devotion
to
his
service
he
then
begins
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
george
after
laughing
cheerfully
and
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
assists
in
these
arrangements
and
helps
to
get
the
gallery
into
business
order
that
done
he
takes
a
turn
at
the
and
afterwards
weighing
himself
and
opining
that
he
is
getting
too
fleshy
engages
with
great
gravity
in
solitary
broadsword
practice
meanwhile
phil
has
fallen
to
work
at
his
usual
table
where
he
screws
and
unscrews
and
cleans
and
files
and
whistles
into
small
apertures
and
blackens
himself
more
and
more
and
seems
to
do
and
undo
everything
that
can
be
done
and
undone
about
a
gun
master
and
man
are
at
length
disturbed
by
footsteps
in
the
passage
where
they
make
an
unusual
sound
denoting
the
arrival
of
unusual
company
these
steps
advancing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
gallery
bring
into
it
a
group
at
first
sight
scarcely
reconcilable
with
any
day
in
the
year
but
the
fifth
of
november
it
consists
of
a
limp
and
ugly
figure
carried
in
a
chair
by
two
bearers
and
attended
by
a
lean
female
with
a
face
like
a
pinched
mask
who
might
be
expected
immediately
to
recite
the
popular
verses
commemorative
of
the
time
when
they
did
contrive
to
blow
old
england
up
alive
but
for
her
keeping
her
lips
tightly
and
defiantly
closed
as
the
chair
is
put
down
at
which
point
the
figure
in
it
gasping
o
lord
oh
dear
me
i
am
shaken
adds
how
de
do
my
dear
friend
how
de
do
george
then
descries
in
the
procession
the
venerable
smallweed
out
for
an
airing
attended
by
his
granddaughter
judy
as
george
my
dear
friend
says
grandfather
smallweed
removing
his
right
arm
from
the
neck
of
one
of
his
bearers
whom
he
has
nearly
throttled
coming
along
how
de
do
you
surprised
to
see
me
my
dear
friend
i
should
hardly
have
been
more
surprised
to
have
seen
your
friend
in
the
city
returns
george
i
am
very
seldom
out

smallweed
i
have
been
out
for
many
months

and

comes
expensive
but
i
longed
so
much
to
see
you

dear
george
how
de
do

am
well
enough
says
george
i
hope
you

the
same

too
well
my
dear
friend
smallweed
takes
him
by
both
hands
i
have
brought
my
granddaughter
judy
i
could
keep
her
away
she
longed
so
much
to
see
you
hum
she
bears
it
calmly
mutters
george
so
we
got
a
and
put
a
chair
in
it
and
just
round
the
corner
they
lifted
me
out
of
the
cab
and
into
the
chair
and
carried
me
here
that
i
might
see
my
dear
friend
in
his
own
establishment
this
says
grandfather
smallweed
alluding
to
the
bearer
who
has
been
in
danger
of
strangulation
and
who
withdraws
adjusting
his
windpipe
is
the
driver
of
the
cab
he
has
nothing
extra
it
is
by
agreement
included
in
his
fare
this
person
the
other
bearer
we
engaged
in
the
street
outside
for
a
pint
of
beer
which
is
twopence
judy
give
the
person
twopence
i
was
not
sure
you
had
a
workman
of
your
own
here
my
dear
friend
or
we
need
have
employed
this
person
grandfather
smallweed
refers
to
phil
with
a
glance
of
considerable
terror
and
a
o
lord
oh
dear
me
nor
in
his
apprehension
on
the
surface
of
things
without
some
reason
for
phil
who
has
never
beheld
the
apparition
in
the
cap
before
has
stopped
short
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
with
much
of
the
air
of
a
dead
shot
intent
on
picking
smallweed
off
as
an
ugly
old
bird
of
the
crow
species
judy
my
child
says
grandfather
smallweed
give
the
person
his
twopence
it
a
great
deal
for
what
he
has
done
the
person
who
is
one
of
those
extraordinary
specimens
of
human
fungus
that
spring
up
spontaneously
in
the
western
streets
of
london
ready
dressed
in
an
old
red
jacket
with
a
mission
for
holding
horses
and
calling
coaches
received
his
twopence
with
anything
but
transport
tosses
the
money
into
the
air
catches
it
and
retires
my
dear
george
says
grandfather
smallweed
would
you
be
so
kind
as
help
to
carry
me
to
the
fire
i
am
accustomed
to
a
fire
and
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
soon
chill
oh
dear
me
his
closing
exclamation
is
jerked
out
of
the
venerable
gentleman
by
the
suddenness
with
which
squod
like
a
genie
catches
him
up
chair
and
all
and
deposits
him
on
the
o
lord
says
smallweed
panting
oh
dear
me
oh
my
stars
my
dear
friend
your
workman
is
very
strong
and
very
prompt
o
lord
he
is
very
prompt
judy
draw
me
back
a
little
i
being
scorched
in
the
legs
which
indeed
is
testified
to
the
noses
of
all
present
by
the
smell
of
his
worsted
stockings
the
gentle
judy
having
backed
her
grandfather
a
little
way
from
the
fire
and
having
shaken
him
up
as
usual
and
having
released
his
overshadowed
eye
from
its
extinguisher
smallweed
again
says
oh
dear
me
o
lord
and
looking
about
and
meeting
george
glance
again
stretches
out
both
hands
my
dear
friend
so
happy
in
this
meeting
and
this
is
your
establishment
it
a
delightful
place
it
a
picture
you
never
find
that
anything
goes
off
here
accidentally
do
you
my
dear
friend
adds
grandfather
smallweed
very
ill
at
ease
no
no
no
fear
of
that
and
your
workman
he
oh
dear
me
he
never
lets
anything
off
without
meaning
it
does
he
my
dear
friend
he
has
never
hurt
anybody
but
himself
says
george
smiling
but
he
might
you
know
he
seems
to
have
hurt
himself
a
good
deal
and
he
might
hurt
somebody
else
the
old
gentleman
returns
he
might
mean
it
or
he
even
might
george
will
you
order
him
to
leave
his
infernal
alone
and
go
away
obedient
to
a
nod
from
the
trooper
phil
retires
to
the
other
end
of
the
gallery
smallweed
reassured
falls
to
rubbing
his
legs
and
you
doing
well
mr
george
he
says
to
the
trooper
squarely
standing
faced
about
towards
him
with
his
broadsword
in
his
hand
you
are
prospering
please
the
powers
george
answers
with
a
cool
nod
adding
go
on
you
have
not
come
to
say
that
i
know
you
are
so
sprightly
george
returns
the
venerable
grandfather
you
are
such
good
company
ha
ha
go
on
says
george
my
dear
friend
but
that
sword
looks
awful
gleaming
and
sharp
it
might
cut
somebody
by
accident
it
makes
me
shiver
george
curse
him
says
the
excellent
old
gentleman
apart
to
judy
as
the
trooper
takes
a
step
or
two
away
to
lay
it
aside
he
owes
me
money
and
might
think
of
paying
off
old
scores
in
this
murdering
place
i
wish
your
brimstone
grandmother
was
here
and
he
shave
her
head
off
george
returning
folds
his
arms
and
looking
down
at
the
old
man
sliding
every
moment
lower
and
lower
in
his
chair
says
quietly
now
for
it
ho
cries
smallweed
rubbing
his
hands
with
an
artful
chuckle
yes
now
for
it
now
for
what
my
dear
friend
for
a
pipe
says
george
who
with
great
composure
sets
his
chair
in
the
takes
his
pipe
from
the
grate
fills
it
and
lights
it
and
falls
to
smoking
peacefully
this
tends
to
the
discomfiture
of
smallweed
who
finds
it
so
difficult
to
resume
his
object
whatever
it
may
be
that
he
becomes
exasperated
and
secretly
claws
the
air
with
an
impotent
vindictiveness
expressive
of
an
intense
desire
to
tear
and
rend
the
visage
of
george
as
the
excellent
old
gentleman
nails
are
long
and
leaden
and
his
hands
lean
and
veinous
and
his
eyes
green
and
watery
and
over
and
above
this
as
he
continues
while
he
claws
to
slide
down
in
his
chair
and
to
collapse
into
a
shapeless
bundle
he
becomes
such
a
ghastly
spectacle
even
in
the
accustomed
eyes
of
judy
that
that
young
virgin
pounces
at
him
with
something
more
than
the
ardour
of
affection
and
so
shakes
him
up
and
pats
and
pokes
him
in
divers
parts
of
his
body
but
particularly
in
that
part
which
the
science
of
would
call
his
wind
that
in
his
grievous
distress
he
utters
enforced
sounds
like
a
paviour
rammer
when
judy
has
by
these
means
set
him
up
again
in
his
chair
with
a
white
face
and
a
frosty
nose
but
still
clawing
she
stretches
out
her
weazen
forefinger
and
gives
george
one
poke
in
the
back
the
trooper
raising
his
head
she
makes
another
poke
at
her
esteemed
grandfather
and
having
thus
brought
them
together
stares
rigidly
at
the
fire
aye
aye
ho
ho
u
u
u
ugh
chatters
grandfather
smallweed
swallowing
his
rage
my
dear
friend
still
clawing
i
tell
you
what
says
george
if
you
want
to
converse
with
me
you
must
speak
out
i
am
one
of
the
roughs
and
i
ca
go
about
and
about
i
have
the
art
to
do
it
i
am
not
clever
enough
it
suit
me
when
you
go
winding
round
and
round
me
says
the
trooper
putting
his
pipe
between
his
lips
again
damme
if
i
do
feel
as
if
i
was
being
smothered
and
he
inflates
his
broad
chest
to
its
utmost
extent
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
is
not
smothered
yet
if
you
have
come
to
give
me
a
friendly
call
continues
george
i
am
obliged
to
you
how
are
you
if
you
have
come
to
see
whether
there
any
property
on
the
premises
look
about
you
you
are
welcome
if
you
want
to
out
with
something
out
with
it
the
blooming
judy
without
removing
her
gaze
from
the
fire
gives
her
grandfather
one
ghostly
poke
you
see
it
her
opinion
too
and
why
the
devil
that
young
woman
wo
sit
down
like
a
christian
says
george
with
his
eyes
musingly
fixed
on
judy
i
ca
comprehend
she
keeps
at
my
side
to
attend
to
me
sir
says
grandfather
smallweed
i
am
an
old
man
my
dear
george
and
i
need
some
attention
i
can
carry
my
years
i
am
not
a
brimstone
snarling
and
looking
unconsciously
for
the
cushion
but
i
need
attention
my
dear
friend
well
returns
the
trooper
wheeling
his
chair
to
face
the
old
man
now
then
my
friend
in
the
city
george
has
done
a
little
business
with
a
pupil
of
yours
has
he
says
george
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
yes
sir
grandfather
smallweed
rubs
his
legs
he
is
a
fine
young
soldier
now
george
by
the
name
of
carstone
friends
came
forward
and
paid
it
all
up
honourable
did
they
returns
george
do
you
think
your
friend
in
the
city
would
like
a
piece
of
advice
i
think
he
would
my
dear
friend
from
you
i
advise
him
then
to
do
no
more
business
in
that
quarter
no
more
to
be
got
by
it
the
young
gentleman
to
my
knowledge
is
brought
to
a
dead
halt
no
no
my
dear
friend
no
no
george
no
no
no
sir
remonstrates
grandfather
smallweed
cunningly
rubbing
his
spare
legs
not
quite
a
dead
halt
i
think
he
has
good
friends
and
he
is
good
for
his
pay
and
he
is
good
for
the
selling
price
of
his
commission
and
he
is
good
for
his
chance
in
a
lawsuit
and
he
is
good
for
his
chance
in
a
wife
and
oh
do
you
know
george
i
think
my
friend
would
consider
the
young
gentleman
good
for
something
yet
says
grandfather
smallweed
turning
up
his
velvet
cap
and
scratching
his
ear
like
a
monkey
george
who
has
put
aside
his
pipe
and
sits
with
an
arm
on
his
beats
a
tattoo
on
the
ground
with
his
right
foot
as
if
he
were
not
particularly
pleased
with
the
turn
the
conversation
has
taken
but
to
pass
from
one
subject
to
another
resumes
smallweed
promote
the
conversation
as
a
joker
might
say
to
pass
george
from
the
ensign
to
the
captain
what
are
you
up
to
now
asks
george
pausing
with
a
frown
in
stroking
the
recollection
of
his
moustache
what
captain
our
captain
the
captain
we
know
of
captain
hawdon
oh
that
it
is
it
says
george
with
a
low
whistle
as
he
sees
both
grandfather
and
granddaughter
looking
hard
at
him
you
are
there
well
what
about
it
come
i
wo
be
smothered
any
more
speak
my
dear
friend
returns
the
old
man
i
was
applied
judy
shake
me
up
a
little
i
was
applied
to
yesterday
about
the
captain
and
my
opinion
still
is
that
the
captain
is
not
dead
bosh
observes
george
what
was
your
remark
my
dear
friend
inquires
the
old
man
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
bosh
ho
says
grandfather
smallweed
george
of
my
opinion
you
can
judge
for
yourself
according
to
the
questions
asked
of
me
and
the
reasons
given
for
asking
now
what
do
you
think
the
lawyer
making
the
inquiries
wants
a
job
says
george
nothing
of
the
kind
ca
be
a
lawyer
then
says
george
folding
his
arms
with
an
air
of
confirmed
resolution
my
dear
friend
he
is
a
lawyer
and
a
famous
one
he
wants
to
see
some
fragment
in
captain
hawdon
writing
he
do
want
to
keep
it
he
only
wants
to
see
it
and
compare
it
with
a
writing
in
his
possession
well
well
george
happening
to
remember
the
advertisement
concerning
captain
hawdon
and
any
information
that
could
be
given
respecting
him
he
looked
it
up
and
came
to
me
just
as
you
did
my
dear
friend
will
you
shake
hands
so
glad
you
came
that
day
i
should
have
missed
forming
such
a
friendship
if
you
had
come
well
mr
smallweed
says
george
again
after
going
through
the
ceremony
with
some
stiffness
i
had
no
such
thing
i
have
nothing
but
his
signature
plague
pestilence
and
famine
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
upon
him
says
the
old
man
making
a
curse
out
of
one
of
his
few
remembrances
of
a
prayer
and
squeezing
up
his
velvet
cap
between
his
angry
hands
i
have
half
a
million
of
his
signatures
i
think
but
you
breathlessly
recovering
his
mildness
of
speech
as
judy
the
cap
on
his
of
a
head
you
my
dear
george
are
likely
to
have
some
letter
or
paper
that
would
suit
the
purpose
anything
would
suit
the
purpose
written
in
the
hand
some
writing
in
that
hand
says
the
trooper
pondering
may
be
i
have
my
dearest
friend
may
be
i
have
not
ho
says
grandfather
smallweed
but
if
i
had
bushels
of
it
i
would
not
show
as
much
as
would
make
a
cartridge
without
knowing
why
sir
i
have
told
you
why
my
dear
george
i
have
told
you
why
not
enough
says
the
trooper
shaking
his
head
i
must
know
more
and
approve
it
then
will
you
come
to
the
lawyer
my
dear
friend
will
you
come
and
see
the
gentleman
urges
grandfather
smallweed
pulling
out
a
lean
old
silver
watch
with
hands
like
the
leg
of
a
skeleton
i
told
him
it
was
probable
i
might
call
upon
him
between
ten
and
eleven
this
forenoon
and
it
now
half
after
ten
will
you
come
and
see
the
gentleman
mr
george
hum
says
he
gravely
i
do
mind
that
though
why
this
should
concern
you
so
much
i
do
know
everything
concerns
me
that
has
a
chance
in
it
of
bringing
anything
to
light
about
him
did
he
take
us
all
in
did
he
owe
us
immense
sums
all
round
concern
me
who
can
anything
about
him
concern
more
than
me
not
my
dear
friend
says
grandfather
smallweed
lowering
his
tone
that
i
want
you
to
betray
anything
far
from
it
are
you
ready
to
come
my
dear
friend
aye
i
come
in
a
moment
i
promise
nothing
you
know
no
my
dear
george
no
and
you
mean
to
say
you
going
to
give
me
a
lift
to
this
place
wherever
it
is
without
charging
for
it
george
inquires
getting
his
hat
and
thick
gloves
this
pleasantry
so
tickles
smallweed
that
he
laughs
long
and
low
before
the
fire
but
ever
while
he
laughs
he
glances
over
his
paralytic
shoulder
at
george
and
eagerly
watches
him
as
he
unlocks
the
padlock
of
a
homely
cupboard
at
the
distant
end
of
the
gallery
looks
here
and
there
upon
the
higher
shelves
and
ultimately
takes
something
out
with
a
rustling
of
paper
folds
it
and
puts
it
in
his
breast
then
judy
pokes
smallweed
once
and
smallweed
pokes
judy
once
i
am
ready
says
the
trooper
coming
back
phil
you
can
carry
this
old
gentleman
to
his
coach
and
make
nothing
of
him
oh
dear
me
o
lord
stop
a
moment
says
smallweed
he
so
very
prompt
are
you
sure
you
can
do
it
carefully
my
worthy
man
phil
makes
no
reply
but
seizing
the
chair
and
its
load
sidles
away
tightly
hugged
by
the
now
speechless
smallweed
and
bolts
along
the
passage
as
if
he
had
an
acceptable
commission
to
carry
the
old
gentleman
to
the
nearest
volcano
his
shorter
trust
however
terminating
at
the
cab
he
deposits
him
there
and
the
fair
judy
takes
her
place
beside
him
and
the
chair
embellishes
the
roof
and
george
takes
the
vacant
place
upon
the
box
george
is
quite
confounded
by
the
spectacle
he
beholds
from
time
to
time
as
he
peeps
into
the
cab
through
the
window
behind
him
where
the
grim
judy
is
always
motionless
and
the
old
gentleman
with
his
cap
over
one
eye
is
always
sliding
off
the
seat
into
the
straw
and
looking
upward
at
him
out
of
his
other
eye
with
a
helpless
expression
of
being
jolted
in
the
back
chapter
xxvii
more
old
soldiers
than
one
george
has
not
far
to
ride
with
folded
arms
upon
the
box
for
their
destination
is
lincoln
inn
fields
when
the
driver
stops
his
horses
george
alights
and
looking
in
at
the
window
says
what
tulkinghorn
your
man
is
he
yes
my
dear
friend
do
you
know
him
mr
george
why
i
have
heard
of
him
seen
him
too
i
think
but
i
do
know
him
and
he
do
know
me
there
ensues
the
carrying
of
smallweed
upstairs
which
is
done
to
perfection
with
the
trooper
help
he
is
borne
into
tulkinghorn
great
room
and
deposited
on
the
turkey
rug
before
the
fire
tulkinghorn
is
not
within
at
the
present
moment
but
will
be
back
directly
the
occupant
of
the
pew
in
the
hall
having
said
thus
much
stirs
the
fire
and
leaves
the
triumvirate
to
warm
themselves
george
is
mightily
curious
in
respect
of
the
room
he
looks
up
at
the
painted
ceiling
looks
round
at
the
old
contemplates
the
portraits
of
the
great
clients
reads
aloud
the
names
on
the
boxes
leicester
dedlock
baronet
george
reads
thoughtfully
ha
of
chesney
wold
humph
george
stands
looking
at
these
boxes
a
long
while
as
if
they
were
pictures
and
comes
back
to
the
fire
repeating
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
and
manor
of
chesney
wold
hey
worth
a
mint
of
money
mr
george
whispers
grandfather
smallweed
rubbing
his
legs
powerfully
rich
who
do
you
mean
this
old
gentleman
or
the
baronet
this
gentleman
this
gentleman
so
i
have
heard
and
knows
a
thing
or
two
i
hold
a
wager
not
bad
quarters
either
says
george
looking
round
again
see
the
yonder
this
reply
is
cut
short
by
tulkinghorn
arrival
there
is
no
change
in
him
of
course
rustily
drest
with
his
spectacles
in
his
hand
and
their
very
case
worn
threadbare
in
manner
close
and
dry
in
voice
husky
and
low
in
face
watchful
behind
a
blind
habitually
not
uncensorious
and
contemptuous
perhaps
the
peerage
may
have
warmer
worshippers
and
faithfuller
believers
than
tulkinghorn
after
all
if
everything
were
known
good
morning
smallweed
good
morning
he
says
as
he
comes
in
you
have
brought
the
sergeant
i
see
sit
down
sergeant
as
tulkinghorn
takes
off
his
gloves
and
puts
them
in
his
hat
he
looks
with
eyes
across
the
room
to
where
the
trooper
stands
and
says
within
himself
perchance
you
do
my
friend
sit
down
sergeant
he
repeats
as
he
comes
to
his
table
which
is
set
on
one
side
of
the
fire
and
takes
his
cold
and
raw
this
morning
cold
and
raw
tulkinghorn
warms
before
the
bars
alternately
the
palms
and
knuckles
of
his
hands
and
looks
from
behind
that
blind
which
is
always
down
at
the
trio
sitting
in
a
little
semicircle
before
him
now
i
can
feel
what
i
am
about
as
perhaps
he
can
in
two
senses
mr
smallweed
the
old
gentleman
is
newly
shaken
up
by
judy
to
bear
his
part
in
the
conversation
you
have
brought
our
good
friend
the
sergeant
i
see
yes
sir
returns
smallweed
very
servile
to
the
wealth
and
influence
and
what
does
the
sergeant
say
about
this
business
george
says
grandfather
smallweed
with
a
tremulous
wave
of
his
shrivelled
hand
this
is
the
gentleman
sir
george
salutes
the
gentleman
but
otherwise
sits
bolt
upright
and
profoundly
silent
very
forward
in
his
chair
as
if
the
full
complement
of
regulation
appendages
for
a
hung
about
him
tulkinghorn
proceeds
well
george
i
believe
your
name
is
george
it
is
so
sir
what
do
you
say
george
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
returns
the
trooper
but
i
should
wish
to
know
what
you
say
do
you
mean
in
point
of
reward
i
mean
in
point
of
everything
sir
this
is
so
very
trying
to
smallweed
temper
that
he
suddenly
breaks
out
with
you
a
brimstone
beast
and
as
suddenly
asks
pardon
of
tulkinghorn
excusing
himself
for
this
slip
of
the
tongue
by
saying
to
judy
i
was
thinking
of
your
grandmother
my
dear
i
supposed
sergeant
tulkinghorn
resumes
as
he
leans
on
one
side
of
his
chair
and
crosses
his
legs
that
smallweed
might
have
sufficiently
explained
the
matter
it
lies
in
the
smallest
compass
however
you
served
under
captain
hawdon
at
one
time
and
were
his
attendant
in
illness
and
rendered
him
many
little
services
and
were
rather
in
his
confidence
i
am
told
that
is
so
is
it
not
yes
sir
that
is
so
says
george
with
military
brevity
therefore
you
may
happen
to
have
in
your
possession
something
anything
no
matter
what
accounts
instructions
orders
a
letter
anything
in
captain
hawdon
writing
i
wish
to
compare
his
writing
with
some
that
i
have
if
you
can
give
me
the
opportunity
you
shall
be
rewarded
for
your
trouble
three
four
five
guineas
you
would
consider
handsome
i
dare
say
noble
my
dear
friend
cries
grandfather
smallweed
screwing
up
his
eyes
if
not
say
how
much
more
in
your
conscience
as
a
soldier
you
can
demand
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
part
with
the
writing
against
your
inclination
though
i
should
prefer
to
have
it
george
sits
squared
in
exactly
the
same
attitude
looks
at
the
painted
ceiling
and
says
never
a
word
the
irascible
smallweed
scratches
the
air
the
question
is
says
tulkinghorn
in
his
methodical
subdued
uninterested
way
first
whether
you
have
any
of
captain
writing
first
whether
i
have
any
of
captain
hawdon
writing
sir
repeats
george
secondly
what
will
satisfy
you
for
the
trouble
of
producing
it
secondly
what
will
satisfy
me
for
the
trouble
of
producing
it
sir
repeats
george
thirdly
you
can
judge
for
yourself
whether
it
is
at
all
like
that
says
tulkinghorn
suddenly
handing
him
some
sheets
of
written
paper
tied
together
whether
it
is
at
all
like
that
sir
just
so
repeats
george
all
three
repetitions
george
pronounces
in
a
mechanical
manner
looking
straight
at
tulkinghorn
nor
does
he
so
much
as
glance
at
the
affidavit
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
that
has
been
given
to
him
for
his
inspection
though
he
still
holds
it
in
his
hand
but
continues
to
look
at
the
lawyer
with
an
air
of
troubled
meditation
well
says
tulkinghorn
what
do
you
say
well
sir
replies
george
rising
erect
and
looking
immense
i
would
rather
if
you
excuse
me
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
tulkinghorn
outwardly
quite
undisturbed
demands
why
not
why
sir
returns
the
trooper
except
on
military
compulsion
i
am
not
a
man
of
business
among
civilians
i
am
what
they
call
in
scotland
a
i
have
no
head
for
papers
sir
i
can
stand
any
fire
better
than
a
fire
of
cross
questions
i
mentioned
to
smallweed
only
an
hour
or
so
ago
that
when
i
come
into
things
of
this
kind
i
feel
as
if
i
was
being
smothered
and
that
is
my
sensation
says
george
looking
round
upon
the
company
at
the
present
moment
with
that
he
takes
three
strides
forward
to
replace
the
papers
on
the
lawyer
table
and
three
strides
backward
to
resume
his
former
station
where
he
stands
perfectly
upright
now
looking
at
the
ground
and
now
at
the
painted
ceiling
with
his
hands
behind
him
as
if
to
prevent
himself
from
accepting
any
other
document
whatever
under
this
provocation
smallweed
favourite
adjective
of
disparagement
is
so
close
to
his
tongue
that
he
begins
the
words
my
dear
friend
with
the
monosyllable
brim
thus
converting
the
possessive
pronoun
into
brimmy
and
appearing
to
have
an
impediment
in
his
speech
once
past
this
difficulty
however
he
exhorts
his
dear
friend
in
the
tenderest
manner
not
to
be
rash
but
to
do
what
so
eminent
a
gentleman
requires
and
to
do
it
with
a
good
grace
confident
that
it
must
be
unobjectionable
as
well
as
profitable
tulkinghorn
merely
utters
an
occasional
sentence
as
you
are
the
best
judge
of
your
own
interest
sergeant
take
care
you
do
no
harm
by
this
please
yourself
please
yourself
if
you
know
what
you
mean
that
quite
enough
these
he
utters
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
indifference
as
he
looks
over
the
papers
on
his
table
and
prepares
to
write
a
letter
george
looks
distrustfully
from
the
painted
ceiling
to
the
ground
from
the
ground
to
smallweed
from
smallweed
to
tulkinghorn
and
from
tulkinghorn
to
the
painted
ceiling
again
often
in
his
perplexity
changing
the
leg
on
which
he
rests
i
do
assure
you
sir
says
george
not
to
say
it
offensively
that
between
you
and
smallweed
here
i
really
am
being
smothered
fifty
times
over
i
really
am
sir
i
am
not
a
match
for
you
gentlemen
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
why
you
want
to
see
the
hand
in
the
case
that
i
could
find
any
specimen
of
it
tulkinghorn
quietly
shakes
his
head
no
if
you
were
a
man
of
business
sergeant
you
would
not
need
to
be
informed
that
there
are
confidential
reasons
very
harmless
in
themselves
for
many
such
wants
in
the
profession
to
which
i
belong
but
if
you
are
afraid
of
doing
any
injury
to
captain
hawdon
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
that
aye
he
is
dead
sir
is
he
tulkinghorn
quietly
sits
down
to
write
well
sir
says
the
trooper
looking
into
his
hat
after
another
disconcerted
pause
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
given
you
more
satisfaction
if
it
would
be
any
satisfaction
to
any
one
that
i
should
be
confirmed
in
my
judgment
that
i
would
rather
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
by
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
a
better
head
for
business
than
i
have
and
who
is
an
old
soldier
i
am
willing
to
consult
with
him
i
i
really
am
so
completely
smothered
myself
at
present
says
george
passing
his
hand
hopelessly
across
his
brow
that
i
do
know
but
what
it
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
smallweed
hearing
that
this
authority
is
an
old
soldier
so
strongly
inculcates
the
expediency
of
the
trooper
taking
counsel
with
him
and
particularly
informing
him
of
its
being
a
question
of
five
guineas
or
more
that
george
engages
to
go
and
see
him
tulkinghorn
says
nothing
either
way
i
consult
my
friend
then
by
your
leave
sir
says
the
trooper
and
i
take
the
liberty
of
looking
in
again
with
the
final
answer
in
the
course
of
the
day
smallweed
if
you
wish
to
be
carried
downstairs
in
a
moment
my
dear
friend
in
a
moment
will
you
first
let
me
speak
half
a
word
with
this
gentleman
in
private
certainly
sir
do
hurry
yourself
on
my
account
the
trooper
retires
to
a
distant
part
of
the
room
and
resumes
his
curious
inspection
of
the
boxes
strong
and
otherwise
if
i
was
as
weak
as
a
brimstone
baby
sir
whispers
grandfather
smallweed
drawing
the
lawyer
down
to
his
level
by
the
lapel
of
his
coat
and
flashing
some
green
fire
out
of
his
angry
eyes
i
tear
the
writing
away
from
him
he
got
it
buttoned
in
his
breast
i
saw
him
put
it
there
judy
saw
him
put
it
there
speak
up
you
crabbed
image
for
the
sign
of
a
shop
and
say
you
saw
him
put
it
there
this
vehement
conjuration
the
old
gentleman
accompanies
with
such
a
thrust
at
his
granddaughter
that
it
is
too
much
for
his
strength
and
he
slips
away
out
of
his
chair
drawing
tulkinghorn
with
him
until
he
is
arrested
by
judy
and
well
shaken
violence
will
not
do
for
me
my
friend
tulkinghorn
then
remarks
coolly
no
no
i
know
i
know
sir
but
it
chafing
and
galling
it
it
worse
than
your
smattering
chattering
magpie
of
a
grandmother
to
the
imperturbable
judy
who
only
looks
at
the
fire
to
know
he
has
got
what
wanted
and
wo
give
it
up
he
not
to
give
it
up
he
a
vagabond
but
never
mind
sir
never
mind
at
the
most
he
has
only
his
own
way
for
a
little
while
i
have
him
periodically
in
a
vice
i
twist
him
sir
i
screw
him
sir
if
he
wo
do
it
with
a
good
grace
i
make
him
do
it
with
a
bad
one
sir
now
my
dear
george
says
grandfather
smallweed
winking
at
the
lawyer
hideously
as
he
releases
him
i
am
ready
for
your
kind
assistance
my
excellent
friend
tulkinghorn
with
some
shadowy
sign
of
amusement
manifesting
itself
through
his
stands
on
the
with
his
back
to
the
fire
watching
the
disappearance
of
smallweed
and
acknowledging
the
trooper
parting
salute
with
one
slight
nod
it
is
more
difficult
to
get
rid
of
the
old
gentleman
george
finds
than
to
bear
a
hand
in
carrying
him
downstairs
for
when
he
is
replaced
in
his
conveyance
he
is
so
loquacious
on
the
subject
of
the
guineas
and
retains
such
an
affectionate
hold
of
his
button
having
in
truth
a
secret
longing
to
rip
his
coat
open
and
rob
him
that
some
degree
of
force
is
necessary
on
the
trooper
part
to
effect
a
separation
it
is
accomplished
at
last
and
he
proceeds
alone
in
quest
of
his
adviser
by
the
cloisterly
temple
and
by
whitefriars
there
not
without
a
glance
at
alley
which
would
seem
to
be
something
in
his
way
and
by
blackfriars
bridge
and
blackfriars
road
george
sedately
marches
to
a
street
of
little
shops
lying
somewhere
in
that
ganglion
of
roads
from
kent
and
surrey
and
of
streets
from
the
bridges
of
london
centring
in
the
elephant
who
has
lost
his
castle
formed
of
a
thousand
coaches
to
a
stronger
iron
monster
than
he
ready
to
chop
him
into
any
day
he
dares
to
one
of
the
little
shops
in
this
street
which
is
a
shop
having
a
few
fiddles
in
the
window
and
some
pan
pipes
and
a
tambourine
and
a
triangle
and
certain
elongated
scraps
of
music
george
directs
his
massive
tread
and
halting
at
a
few
paces
from
it
as
he
sees
a
soldierly
looking
woman
with
her
outer
skirts
tucked
up
come
forth
with
a
small
wooden
tub
and
in
that
tub
commence
and
on
the
margin
of
the
pavement
george
says
to
himself
she
as
usual
washing
greens
i
never
saw
her
except
upon
a
when
she
was
washing
greens
the
subject
of
this
reflection
is
at
all
events
so
occupied
in
washing
greens
at
present
that
she
remains
unsuspicious
of
george
approach
until
lifting
up
herself
and
her
tub
together
when
she
has
poured
the
water
off
into
the
gutter
she
finds
him
standing
near
her
her
reception
of
him
is
not
flattering
george
i
never
see
you
but
i
wish
you
was
a
hundred
mile
away
the
trooper
without
remarking
on
this
welcome
follows
into
the
shop
where
the
lady
places
her
tub
of
greens
upon
the
counter
and
having
shaken
hands
with
him
rests
her
arms
upon
it
i
never
she
says
george
consider
matthew
bagnet
safe
a
minute
when
you
near
him
you
are
that
restless
and
that
roving
yes
i
know
i
am
bagnet
i
know
i
am
you
know
you
are
says
bagnet
what
the
use
of
that
why
are
you
the
nature
of
the
animal
i
suppose
returns
the
trooper
ah
cries
bagnet
something
shrilly
but
what
satisfaction
will
the
nature
of
the
animal
be
to
me
when
the
animal
shall
have
tempted
my
mat
away
from
the
musical
business
to
new
zealand
or
australey
bagnet
is
not
at
all
an
woman
rather
a
little
coarse
in
the
grain
and
freckled
by
the
sun
and
wind
which
have
tanned
her
hair
upon
the
forehead
but
healthy
wholesome
and
a
strong
busy
active
woman
of
from
to
fifty
clean
hardy
and
so
economically
dressed
though
substantially
that
the
only
article
of
ornament
of
which
she
stands
possessed
appear
to
be
her
around
which
her
finger
has
grown
to
be
so
large
since
it
was
put
on
that
it
will
never
come
off
again
until
it
shall
mingle
with
bagnet
dust
bagnet
says
the
trooper
i
am
on
my
parole
with
you
mat
will
get
no
harm
from
me
you
may
trust
me
so
far
well
i
think
i
may
but
the
very
looks
of
you
are
unsettling
bagnet
rejoins
ah
george
george
if
you
had
only
settled
down
and
married
joe
pouch
widow
when
he
died
in
north
america
she
have
combed
your
hair
for
you
it
was
a
chance
for
me
certainly
returns
the
trooper
half
laughingly
half
seriously
but
i
shall
never
settle
down
into
a
respectable
man
now
joe
pouch
widow
might
have
done
me
good
there
was
something
in
her
and
something
of
her
but
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
it
if
i
had
had
the
luck
to
meet
with
such
a
wife
as
mat
found
bagnet
who
seems
in
a
virtuous
way
to
be
under
little
reserve
with
a
good
sort
of
fellow
but
to
be
another
good
sort
of
fellow
herself
for
that
matter
receives
this
compliment
by
flicking
george
in
the
face
with
a
head
of
greens
and
taking
her
tub
into
the
little
room
behind
the
shop
why
quebec
my
poppet
says
george
following
on
invitation
into
that
department
and
little
malta
too
come
and
kiss
your
bluffy
these
young
ladies
not
supposed
to
have
been
actually
christened
by
the
names
applied
to
them
though
always
so
called
in
the
family
from
the
places
of
their
birth
in
barracks
are
respectively
employed
on
stools
the
younger
some
five
or
six
years
old
in
learning
her
letters
out
of
a
penny
primer
the
elder
eight
or
nine
perhaps
in
teaching
her
and
sewing
with
great
assiduity
both
hail
george
with
acclamations
as
an
old
friend
and
after
some
kissing
and
romping
plant
their
stools
beside
him
and
how
young
woolwich
says
george
ah
there
now
cries
bagnet
turning
about
from
her
saucepans
for
she
is
cooking
dinner
with
a
bright
flush
on
her
face
would
you
believe
it
got
an
engagement
at
the
theayter
with
his
father
to
play
the
fife
in
a
military
piece
well
done
my
godson
cries
george
slapping
his
thigh
i
believe
you
says
bagnet
he
a
briton
that
what
woolwich
is
a
briton
and
mat
blows
away
at
his
bassoon
and
you
respectable
civilians
one
and
all
says
george
family
people
children
growing
up
mat
old
mother
in
scotland
and
your
old
father
somewhere
else
corresponded
with
and
helped
a
little
and
well
well
to
be
sure
i
do
know
why
i
should
be
wished
a
hundred
mile
away
for
i
have
not
much
to
do
with
all
this
george
is
becoming
thoughtful
sitting
before
the
fire
in
the
whitewashed
room
which
has
a
sanded
floor
and
a
barrack
smell
and
contains
nothing
superfluous
and
has
not
a
visible
speck
of
dirt
or
dust
in
it
from
the
faces
of
quebec
and
malta
to
the
bright
tin
pots
and
pannikins
upon
the
dresser
shelves
george
is
becoming
thoughtful
sitting
here
while
bagnet
is
busy
when
bagnet
and
young
woolwich
opportunely
come
home
bagnet
is
an
tall
and
upright
with
shaggy
eyebrows
and
whiskers
like
the
fibres
of
a
not
a
hair
upon
his
head
and
a
torrid
complexion
his
voice
short
deep
and
resonant
is
not
at
all
unlike
the
tones
of
the
instrument
to
which
he
is
devoted
indeed
there
may
be
generally
observed
in
him
an
unbending
unyielding
air
as
if
he
were
himself
the
bassoon
of
the
human
orchestra
young
woolwich
is
the
type
and
model
of
a
young
drummer
both
father
and
son
salute
the
trooper
heartily
he
saying
in
due
season
that
he
has
come
to
advise
with
bagnet
bagnet
hospitably
declares
that
he
will
hear
of
no
business
until
after
dinner
and
that
his
friend
shall
not
partake
of
his
counsel
without
first
partaking
of
boiled
pork
and
greens
the
trooper
yielding
to
this
invitation
he
and
bagnet
not
to
embarrass
the
domestic
preparations
go
forth
to
take
a
turn
up
and
down
the
little
street
which
they
promenade
with
measured
tread
and
folded
arms
as
if
it
were
a
rampart
george
says
bagnet
you
know
me
it
my
old
girl
that
advises
she
has
the
head
but
i
never
own
to
it
before
her
discipline
must
be
maintained
wait
till
the
greens
is
off
her
mind
then
we
consult
whatever
the
old
girl
says
do
do
it
i
intend
to
mat
replies
the
other
i
would
sooner
take
her
opinion
than
that
of
a
college
college
returns
bagnet
in
short
sentences
what
college
could
you
leave
in
another
quarter
of
the
world
with
nothing
but
a
grey
cloak
and
an
umbrella
to
make
its
way
home
to
europe
the
old
girl
would
do
it
did
it
once
you
are
right
says
george
what
college
pursues
bagnet
could
you
set
up
in
life
with
two
of
white
lime
a
of
fuller
earth
a
of
sand
and
the
rest
of
the
change
out
of
sixpence
in
money
what
the
old
girl
started
on
in
the
present
business
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
it
thriving
mat
the
old
girl
says
bagnet
acquiescing
saves
has
a
stocking
somewhere
with
money
in
it
i
never
saw
it
but
i
know
she
got
it
wait
till
the
greens
is
off
her
mind
then
she
set
you
up
she
is
a
treasure
exclaims
george
she
more
but
i
never
own
to
it
before
her
discipline
must
be
maintained
it
was
the
old
girl
that
brought
out
my
musical
abilities
i
should
have
been
in
the
artillery
now
but
for
the
old
girl
six
years
i
hammered
at
the
fiddle
ten
at
the
flute
the
old
girl
said
it
would
do
intention
good
but
want
of
flexibility
try
the
bassoon
the
old
girl
borrowed
a
bassoon
from
the
bandmaster
of
the
rifle
regiment
i
practised
in
the
trenches
got
on
got
another
get
a
living
by
it
george
remarks
that
she
looks
as
fresh
as
a
rose
and
as
sound
as
an
apple
the
old
girl
says
bagnet
in
reply
is
a
thoroughly
fine
woman
consequently
she
is
like
a
thoroughly
fine
day
gets
finer
as
she
gets
on
i
never
saw
the
old
girl
equal
but
i
never
own
to
it
before
her
discipline
must
be
maintained
proceeding
to
converse
on
indifferent
matters
they
walk
up
and
down
the
little
street
keeping
step
and
time
until
summoned
by
quebec
and
malta
to
do
justice
to
the
pork
and
greens
over
which
bagnet
like
a
military
chaplain
says
a
short
grace
in
the
distribution
of
these
comestibles
as
in
every
other
household
duty
bagnet
developes
an
exact
system
sitting
with
every
dish
before
her
allotting
to
every
portion
of
pork
its
own
portion
of
greens
potatoes
and
even
mustard
and
serving
it
out
complete
having
likewise
served
out
the
beer
from
a
can
and
thus
supplied
the
mess
with
all
things
necessary
bagnet
proceeds
to
satisfy
her
own
hunger
which
is
in
a
healthy
state
the
kit
of
the
mess
if
the
table
furniture
may
be
so
denominated
is
chiefly
composed
of
utensils
of
horn
and
tin
that
have
done
duty
in
several
parts
of
the
world
young
woolwich
knife
in
particular
which
is
of
the
oyster
kind
with
the
additional
feature
of
a
strong
movement
which
frequently
balks
the
appetite
of
that
young
musician
is
mentioned
as
having
gone
in
various
hands
the
complete
round
of
foreign
service
the
dinner
done
bagnet
assisted
by
the
younger
branches
who
polish
their
own
cups
and
platters
knives
and
forks
makes
all
the
dinner
garniture
shine
as
brightly
as
before
and
puts
it
all
away
first
sweeping
the
hearth
to
the
end
that
bagnet
and
the
visitor
may
not
be
retarded
in
the
smoking
of
their
pipes
these
household
cares
involve
much
pattening
and
in
the
backyard
and
considerable
use
of
a
pail
which
is
finally
so
happy
as
to
assist
in
the
ablutions
of
bagnet
herself
that
old
girl
reappearing
by
and
by
quite
fresh
and
sitting
down
to
her
needlework
then
and
only
then
the
greens
being
only
then
to
be
considered
as
entirely
off
her
mind
bagnet
requests
the
trooper
to
state
his
case
this
george
does
with
great
discretion
appearing
to
address
himself
to
bagnet
but
having
an
eye
solely
on
the
old
girl
all
the
time
as
bagnet
has
himself
she
equally
discreet
busies
herself
with
her
needlework
the
case
fully
stated
bagnet
resorts
to
his
standard
artifice
for
the
maintenance
of
discipline
that
the
whole
of
it
is
it
george
says
he
that
the
whole
of
it
you
act
according
to
my
opinion
i
shall
be
guided
replies
george
entirely
by
it
old
girl
says
bagnet
give
him
my
opinion
you
know
it
tell
him
what
it
is
it
is
that
he
can
not
have
too
little
to
do
with
people
who
are
too
deep
for
him
and
can
not
be
too
careful
of
interference
with
matters
he
does
not
understand
that
the
plain
rule
is
to
do
nothing
in
the
dark
to
be
a
party
to
nothing
underhanded
or
mysterious
and
never
to
put
his
foot
where
he
can
not
see
the
ground
this
in
effect
is
bagnet
opinion
as
delivered
through
the
old
girl
and
it
so
relieves
george
mind
by
confirming
his
own
opinion
and
banishing
his
doubts
that
he
composes
himself
to
smoke
another
pipe
on
that
exceptional
occasion
and
to
have
a
talk
over
old
times
with
the
whole
bagnet
family
according
to
their
various
ranges
of
experience
through
these
means
it
comes
to
pass
that
george
does
not
again
rise
to
his
full
height
in
that
parlour
until
the
time
is
drawing
on
when
the
bassoon
and
fife
are
expected
by
a
british
public
at
the
theatre
and
as
it
takes
time
even
then
for
george
in
his
domestic
character
of
bluffy
to
take
leave
of
quebec
and
malta
and
insinuate
a
sponsorial
shilling
into
the
pocket
of
his
godson
with
felicitations
on
his
success
in
life
it
is
dark
when
george
again
turns
his
face
towards
lincoln
inn
fields
a
family
home
he
ruminates
as
he
marches
along
however
small
it
is
makes
a
man
like
me
look
lonely
but
it
well
i
never
made
that
evolution
of
matrimony
i
should
have
been
fit
for
it
i
am
such
a
vagabond
still
even
at
my
present
time
of
life
that
i
could
hold
to
the
gallery
a
month
together
if
it
was
a
regular
pursuit
or
if
i
did
camp
there
gipsy
fashion
come
i
disgrace
nobody
and
cumber
nobody
that
something
i
have
not
done
that
for
many
a
long
year
so
he
whistles
it
off
and
marches
on
arrived
in
lincoln
inn
fields
and
mounting
tulkinghorn
stair
he
finds
the
outer
door
closed
and
the
chambers
shut
but
the
trooper
not
knowing
much
about
outer
doors
and
the
staircase
being
dark
besides
he
is
yet
fumbling
and
groping
about
hoping
to
discover
a
or
to
open
the
door
for
himself
when
tulkinghorn
comes
up
the
stairs
quietly
of
course
and
angrily
asks
who
is
that
what
are
you
doing
there
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
it
george
the
sergeant
and
could
george
the
sergeant
see
that
my
door
was
locked
why
no
sir
i
could
at
any
rate
i
did
says
the
trooper
rather
nettled
have
you
changed
your
mind
or
are
you
in
the
same
mind
tulkinghorn
demands
but
he
knows
well
enough
at
a
glance
in
the
same
mind
sir
i
thought
so
that
sufficient
you
can
go
so
you
are
the
man
says
tulkinghorn
opening
his
door
with
the
key
in
whose
gridley
was
found
yes
i
am
the
man
says
the
trooper
stopping
two
or
three
stairs
down
what
then
sir
what
then
i
do
like
your
associates
you
should
not
have
seen
the
inside
of
my
door
this
morning
if
i
had
thought
of
your
being
that
man
gridley
a
threatening
murderous
dangerous
fellow
with
these
words
spoken
in
an
unusually
high
tone
for
him
the
lawyer
goes
into
his
rooms
and
shuts
the
door
with
a
thundering
noise
george
takes
his
dismissal
in
great
dudgeon
the
greater
because
a
clerk
coming
up
the
stairs
has
heard
the
last
words
of
all
and
evidently
applies
them
to
him
a
pretty
character
to
bear
the
trooper
growls
with
a
hasty
oath
as
he
strides
downstairs
a
threatening
murderous
dangerous
fellow
and
looking
up
he
sees
the
clerk
looking
down
at
him
and
marking
him
as
he
passes
a
lamp
this
so
intensifies
his
dudgeon
that
for
five
minutes
he
is
in
an
ill
humour
but
he
whistles
that
off
like
the
rest
of
it
and
marches
home
to
the
shooting
gallery
chapter
xxviii
the
ironmaster
sir
leicester
dedlock
has
got
the
better
for
the
time
being
of
the
family
gout
and
is
once
more
in
a
literal
no
less
than
in
a
figurative
point
of
view
upon
his
legs
he
is
at
his
place
in
lincolnshire
but
the
waters
are
out
again
on
the
grounds
and
the
cold
and
damp
steal
into
chesney
wold
though
well
defended
and
eke
into
sir
leicester
bones
the
blazing
fires
of
faggot
and
coal
dedlock
timber
and
antediluvian
forest
that
blaze
upon
the
broad
wide
hearths
and
wink
in
the
twilight
on
the
frowning
woods
sullen
to
see
how
trees
are
sacrificed
do
not
exclude
the
enemy
the
pipes
that
trail
themselves
all
over
the
house
the
cushioned
doors
and
windows
and
the
screens
and
curtains
fail
to
supply
the
fires
deficiencies
and
to
satisfy
sir
leicester
need
hence
the
fashionable
intelligence
proclaims
one
morning
to
the
listening
earth
that
lady
dedlock
is
expected
shortly
to
return
to
town
for
a
few
weeks
it
is
a
melancholy
truth
that
even
great
men
have
their
poor
relations
indeed
great
men
have
often
more
than
their
fair
share
of
poor
relations
inasmuch
as
very
red
blood
of
the
superior
quality
like
inferior
blood
unlawfully
shed
will
cry
aloud
and
will
be
heard
sir
leicester
cousins
in
the
remotest
degree
are
so
many
murders
in
the
respect
that
they
will
out
among
whom
there
are
cousins
who
are
so
poor
that
one
might
almost
dare
to
think
it
would
have
been
the
happier
for
them
never
to
have
been
plated
links
upon
the
dedlock
chain
of
gold
but
to
have
been
made
of
common
iron
at
first
and
done
base
service
service
however
with
a
few
limited
reservations
genteel
but
not
profitable
they
may
not
do
being
of
the
dedlock
dignity
so
they
visit
their
richer
cousins
and
get
into
debt
when
they
can
and
live
but
shabbily
when
they
ca
and
find
the
women
no
husbands
and
the
men
no
wives
and
ride
in
borrowed
carriages
and
sit
at
feasts
that
are
never
of
their
own
making
and
so
go
through
high
life
the
rich
family
sum
has
been
divided
by
so
many
figures
and
they
are
the
something
over
that
nobody
knows
what
to
do
with
everybody
on
sir
leicester
dedlock
side
of
the
question
and
of
his
way
of
thinking
would
appear
to
be
his
cousin
more
or
less
from
my
lord
boodle
through
the
duke
of
foodle
down
to
noodle
sir
leicester
like
a
glorious
spider
stretches
his
threads
of
relationship
but
while
he
is
stately
in
the
cousinship
of
the
everybodys
he
is
a
kind
and
generous
man
according
to
his
dignified
way
in
the
cousinship
of
the
nobodys
and
at
the
present
time
in
despite
of
the
damp
he
stays
out
the
visit
of
several
such
cousins
at
chesney
wold
with
the
constancy
of
a
martyr
of
these
foremost
in
the
front
rank
stands
volumnia
dedlock
a
young
lady
of
sixty
who
is
doubly
highly
related
having
the
honour
to
be
a
poor
relation
by
the
mother
side
to
another
great
family
miss
volumnia
displaying
in
early
life
a
pretty
talent
for
cutting
ornaments
out
of
coloured
paper
and
also
for
singing
to
the
guitar
in
the
spanish
tongue
and
propounding
french
conundrums
in
country
houses
passed
the
twenty
years
of
her
existence
between
twenty
and
forty
in
a
sufficiently
agreeable
manner
lapsing
then
out
of
date
and
being
considered
to
bore
mankind
by
her
vocal
performances
in
the
spanish
language
she
retired
to
bath
where
she
lives
slenderly
on
an
annual
present
from
sir
leicester
and
whence
she
makes
occasional
resurrections
in
the
country
houses
of
her
cousins
she
has
an
extensive
acquaintance
at
bath
among
appalling
old
gentlemen
with
thin
legs
and
nankeen
trousers
and
is
of
high
standing
in
that
dreary
city
but
she
is
a
little
dreaded
elsewhere
in
consequence
of
an
indiscreet
profusion
in
the
article
of
rouge
and
persistency
in
an
obsolete
pearl
necklace
like
a
rosary
of
little
in
any
country
in
a
wholesome
state
volumnia
would
be
a
clear
case
for
the
pension
list
efforts
have
been
made
to
get
her
on
it
and
when
william
buffy
came
in
it
was
fully
expected
that
her
name
would
be
put
down
for
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year
but
william
buffy
somehow
discovered
contrary
to
all
expectation
that
these
were
not
the
times
when
it
could
be
done
and
this
was
the
first
clear
indication
sir
leicester
dedlock
had
conveyed
to
him
that
the
country
was
going
to
pieces
there
is
likewise
the
honourable
bob
stables
who
can
make
warm
mashes
with
the
skill
of
a
veterinary
surgeon
and
is
a
better
shot
than
most
gamekeepers
he
has
been
for
some
time
particularly
desirous
to
serve
his
country
in
a
post
of
good
emoluments
unaccompanied
by
any
trouble
or
responsibility
in
a
body
politic
this
natural
desire
on
the
part
of
a
spirited
young
gentleman
so
highly
connected
would
be
speedily
recognized
but
somehow
william
buffy
found
when
he
came
in
that
these
were
not
times
in
which
he
could
manage
that
little
matter
either
and
this
was
the
second
indication
sir
leicester
dedlock
had
conveyed
to
him
that
the
country
was
going
to
pieces
the
rest
of
the
cousins
are
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
various
ages
and
capacities
the
major
part
amiable
and
sensible
and
likely
to
have
done
well
enough
in
life
if
they
could
have
overcome
their
cousinship
as
it
is
they
are
almost
all
a
little
worsted
by
it
and
lounge
in
purposeless
and
listless
paths
and
seem
to
be
quite
as
much
at
a
loss
how
to
dispose
of
themselves
as
anybody
else
can
be
how
to
dispose
of
them
in
this
society
and
where
not
my
lady
dedlock
reigns
supreme
beautiful
elegant
accomplished
and
powerful
in
her
little
world
for
the
world
of
fashion
does
not
stretch
all
the
way
from
pole
to
pole
her
influence
in
sir
leicester
house
however
haughty
and
indifferent
her
manner
is
greatly
to
improve
it
and
refine
it
the
cousins
even
those
older
cousins
who
were
paralysed
when
sir
leicester
married
her
do
her
feudal
homage
and
the
honourable
bob
stables
daily
repeats
to
some
chosen
person
between
breakfast
and
lunch
his
favourite
original
remark
that
she
is
the
woman
in
the
whole
stud
such
the
guests
in
the
long
at
chesney
wold
this
dismal
night
when
the
step
on
the
ghost
walk
inaudible
here
however
might
be
the
step
of
a
deceased
cousin
shut
out
in
the
cold
it
is
near
bedroom
fires
blaze
brightly
all
over
the
house
raising
ghosts
of
grim
furniture
on
wall
and
ceiling
bedroom
candlesticks
bristle
on
the
distant
table
by
the
door
and
cousins
yawn
on
ottomans
cousins
at
the
piano
cousins
at
the
tray
cousins
rising
from
the
cousins
gathered
round
the
fire
standing
on
one
side
of
his
own
peculiar
fire
for
there
are
two
sir
leicester
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
broad
hearth
my
lady
at
her
table
volumnia
as
one
of
the
more
privileged
cousins
in
a
luxurious
chair
between
them
sir
leicester
glancing
with
magnificent
displeasure
at
the
rouge
and
the
pearl
necklace
i
occasionally
meet
on
my
staircase
here
drawls
volumnia
whose
thoughts
perhaps
are
already
hopping
up
it
to
bed
after
a
long
evening
of
very
desultory
talk
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
i
think
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
a
protegee
of
my
lady
observes
sir
leicester
i
thought
so
i
felt
sure
that
some
uncommon
eye
must
have
picked
that
girl
out
she
really
is
a
marvel
a
dolly
sort
of
beauty
perhaps
says
miss
volumnia
reserving
her
own
sort
but
in
its
way
perfect
such
bloom
i
never
saw
sir
leicester
with
his
magnificent
glance
of
displeasure
at
the
rouge
appears
to
say
so
too
indeed
remarks
my
lady
languidly
if
there
is
any
uncommon
eye
in
the
case
it
is
rouncewell
and
not
mine
rosa
is
her
discovery
your
maid
i
suppose
no
my
anything
pet
secretary
messenger
i
do
know
what
you
like
to
have
her
about
you
as
you
would
like
to
have
a
flower
or
a
bird
or
a
picture
or
a
poodle
no
not
a
poodle
though
or
anything
else
that
was
equally
pretty
says
volumnia
sympathizing
yes
how
charming
now
and
how
well
that
delightful
old
soul
rouncewell
is
looking
she
must
be
an
immense
age
and
yet
she
is
as
active
and
handsome
she
is
the
dearest
friend
i
have
positively
sir
leicester
feels
it
to
be
right
and
fitting
that
the
housekeeper
of
chesney
wold
should
be
a
remarkable
person
apart
from
that
he
has
a
real
regard
for
rouncewell
and
likes
to
hear
her
praised
so
he
says
you
are
right
volumnia
which
volumnia
is
extremely
glad
to
hear
she
has
no
daughter
of
her
own
has
she
rouncewell
no
volumnia
she
has
a
son
indeed
she
had
two
my
lady
whose
chronic
malady
of
boredom
has
been
sadly
aggravated
by
volumnia
this
evening
glances
wearily
towards
the
candlesticks
and
heaves
a
noiseless
sigh
and
it
is
a
remarkable
example
of
the
confusion
into
which
the
present
age
has
fallen
of
the
obliteration
of
landmarks
the
opening
of
floodgates
and
the
uprooting
of
distinctions
says
sir
leicester
with
stately
gloom
that
i
have
been
informed
by
tulkinghorn
that
rouncewell
son
has
been
invited
to
go
into
parliament
miss
volumnia
utters
a
little
sharp
scream
yes
indeed
repeats
sir
leicester
into
parliament
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
good
gracious
what
is
the
man
exclaims
volumnia
he
is
called
i
believe
an
ironmaster
sir
leicester
says
it
slowly
and
with
gravity
and
doubt
as
not
being
sure
but
that
he
is
called
a
or
that
the
right
word
may
be
some
other
word
expressive
of
some
other
relationship
to
some
other
metal
volumnia
utters
another
little
scream
he
has
declined
the
proposal
if
my
information
from
tulkinghorn
be
correct
as
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
tulkinghorn
being
always
correct
and
exact
still
that
does
not
says
sir
leicester
that
does
not
lessen
the
anomaly
which
is
fraught
with
strange
considerations
startling
considerations
as
it
appears
to
me
miss
volumnia
rising
with
a
look
sir
leicester
politely
performs
the
grand
tour
of
the
brings
one
and
lights
it
at
my
lady
shaded
lamp
i
must
beg
you
my
lady
he
says
while
doing
so
to
remain
a
few
moments
for
this
individual
of
whom
i
speak
arrived
this
evening
shortly
before
dinner
and
requested
in
a
very
becoming
note
sir
leicester
with
his
habitual
regard
to
truth
dwells
upon
it
i
am
bound
to
say
in
a
very
becoming
and
note
the
favour
of
a
short
interview
with
yourself
and
myself
on
the
subject
of
this
young
girl
as
it
appeared
that
he
wished
to
depart
i
replied
that
we
would
see
him
before
retiring
miss
volumnia
with
a
third
little
scream
takes
flight
wishing
her
hosts
o
lud
well
rid
of
the
what
is
it
ironmaster
the
other
cousins
soon
disperse
to
the
last
cousin
there
sir
leicester
rings
the
bell
make
my
compliments
to
rouncewell
in
the
housekeeper
apartments
and
say
i
can
receive
him
now
my
lady
who
has
heard
all
this
with
slight
attention
outwardly
looks
towards
rouncewell
as
he
comes
in
he
is
a
little
over
fifty
perhaps
of
a
good
figure
like
his
mother
and
has
a
clear
voice
a
broad
forehead
from
which
his
dark
hair
has
retired
and
a
shrewd
though
open
face
he
is
a
gentleman
dressed
in
black
portly
enough
but
strong
and
active
has
a
perfectly
natural
and
easy
air
and
is
not
in
the
least
embarrassed
by
the
great
presence
into
which
he
comes
sir
leicester
and
lady
dedlock
as
i
have
already
apologized
for
intruding
on
you
i
can
not
do
better
than
be
very
brief
i
thank
you
sir
leicester
the
head
of
the
dedlocks
has
motioned
towards
a
sofa
between
himself
and
my
lady
rouncewell
quietly
takes
his
seat
there
in
these
busy
times
when
so
many
great
undertakings
are
in
progress
people
like
myself
have
so
many
workmen
in
so
many
places
that
we
are
always
on
the
flight
sir
leicester
is
content
enough
that
the
ironmaster
should
feel
that
there
is
no
hurry
there
there
in
that
ancient
house
rooted
in
that
quiet
park
where
the
ivy
and
the
moss
have
had
time
to
mature
and
the
gnarled
and
warted
elms
and
the
umbrageous
oaks
stand
deep
in
the
fern
and
leaves
of
a
hundred
years
and
where
the
on
the
terrace
has
dumbly
recorded
for
centuries
that
time
which
was
as
much
the
property
of
every
dedlock
while
he
lasted
as
the
house
and
lands
sir
leicester
sits
down
in
an
opposing
his
repose
and
that
of
chesney
wold
to
the
restless
flights
of
ironmasters
lady
dedlock
has
been
so
kind
proceeds
rouncewell
with
a
respectful
glance
and
a
bow
that
way
as
to
place
near
her
a
young
beauty
of
the
name
of
rosa
now
my
son
has
fallen
in
love
with
rosa
and
has
asked
my
consent
to
his
proposing
marriage
to
her
and
to
their
becoming
engaged
if
she
will
take
him
which
i
suppose
she
will
i
have
never
seen
rosa
until
but
i
have
some
confidence
in
my
son
good
sense
even
in
love
i
find
her
what
he
represents
her
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
and
my
mother
speaks
of
her
with
great
commendation
she
in
all
respects
deserves
it
says
my
lady
i
am
happy
lady
dedlock
that
you
say
so
and
i
need
not
comment
on
the
value
to
me
of
your
kind
opinion
of
her
that
observes
sir
leicester
with
unspeakable
grandeur
for
he
thinks
the
ironmaster
a
little
too
glib
must
be
quite
unnecessary
quite
unnecessary
sir
leicester
now
my
son
is
a
very
young
man
and
rosa
is
a
very
young
woman
as
i
made
my
way
so
my
son
must
make
his
and
his
being
married
at
present
is
out
of
the
question
but
supposing
i
gave
my
consent
to
his
engaging
himself
to
this
pretty
girl
if
this
pretty
girl
will
engage
herself
to
him
i
think
it
a
piece
of
candour
to
say
at
once
i
am
sure
sir
leicester
and
lady
dedlock
you
will
understand
and
excuse
me
i
should
make
it
a
condition
that
she
did
not
remain
at
chesney
wold
therefore
before
communicating
further
with
my
son
i
take
the
liberty
of
saying
that
if
her
removal
would
be
in
any
way
inconvenient
or
objectionable
i
will
hold
the
matter
over
with
him
for
any
reasonable
time
and
leave
it
precisely
where
it
is
not
remain
at
chesney
wold
make
it
a
condition
all
sir
old
misgivings
relative
to
wat
tyler
and
the
people
in
the
iron
districts
who
do
nothing
but
turn
out
by
torchlight
come
in
a
shower
upon
his
head
the
fine
grey
hair
of
which
as
well
as
of
his
whiskers
actually
stirs
with
indignation
am
i
to
understand
sir
says
sir
leicester
and
is
my
lady
to
understand
he
brings
her
in
thus
specially
first
as
a
point
of
gallantry
and
next
as
a
point
of
prudence
having
great
reliance
on
her
sense
am
i
to
understand
rouncewell
and
is
my
lady
to
understand
sir
that
you
consider
this
young
woman
too
good
for
chesney
wold
or
likely
to
be
injured
by
remaining
here
certainly
not
sir
leicester
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
sir
leicester
very
lofty
indeed
pray
rouncewell
says
my
lady
warning
sir
leicester
off
with
the
slightest
gesture
of
her
pretty
hand
as
if
he
were
a
fly
explain
to
me
what
you
mean
willingly
lady
dedlock
there
is
nothing
i
could
desire
more
addressing
her
composed
face
whose
intelligence
however
is
too
quick
and
active
to
be
concealed
by
any
studied
impassiveness
however
habitual
to
the
strong
saxon
face
of
the
visitor
a
picture
of
resolution
and
perseverance
my
lady
listens
with
attention
occasionally
slightly
bending
her
head
i
am
the
son
of
your
housekeeper
lady
dedlock
and
passed
my
childhood
about
this
house
my
mother
has
lived
here
half
a
century
and
will
die
here
i
have
no
doubt
she
is
one
of
those
examples
perhaps
as
good
a
one
as
there
is
of
love
and
attachment
and
fidelity
in
such
a
nation
which
england
may
well
be
proud
of
but
of
which
no
order
can
appropriate
the
whole
pride
or
the
whole
merit
because
such
an
instance
bespeaks
high
worth
on
two
sides
on
the
great
side
assuredly
on
the
small
one
no
less
assuredly
sir
leicester
snorts
a
little
to
hear
the
law
laid
down
in
this
way
but
in
his
honour
and
his
love
of
truth
he
freely
though
silently
admits
the
justice
of
the
ironmaster
proposition
pardon
me
for
saying
what
is
so
obvious
but
i
would
have
it
hastily
supposed
with
the
least
turn
of
his
eyes
towards
sir
leicester
that
i
am
ashamed
of
my
mother
position
here
or
wanting
in
all
just
respect
for
chesney
wold
and
the
family
i
certainly
may
have
desired
i
certainly
have
desired
lady
dedlock
that
my
mother
should
retire
after
so
many
years
and
end
her
days
with
me
but
as
i
have
found
that
to
sever
this
strong
bond
would
be
to
break
her
heart
i
have
long
abandoned
that
idea
sir
leicester
very
magnificent
again
at
the
notion
of
rouncewell
being
spirited
off
from
her
natural
home
to
end
her
days
with
an
ironmaster
i
have
been
proceeds
the
visitor
in
a
modest
clear
way
an
apprentice
and
a
workman
i
have
lived
on
workman
wages
years
and
years
and
beyond
a
certain
point
have
had
to
educate
myself
my
wife
was
a
foreman
daughter
and
plainly
brought
up
we
have
three
daughters
besides
this
son
of
whom
i
have
spoken
and
being
fortunately
able
to
give
them
greater
advantages
than
we
have
had
ourselves
we
have
educated
them
well
very
well
it
has
been
one
of
our
great
cares
and
pleasures
to
make
them
worthy
of
any
station
a
little
boastfulness
in
his
fatherly
tone
here
as
if
he
added
in
his
heart
even
of
the
chesney
wold
station
not
a
little
more
magnificence
therefore
on
the
part
of
sir
leicester
all
this
is
so
frequent
lady
dedlock
where
i
live
and
among
the
class
to
which
i
belong
that
what
would
be
generally
called
unequal
marriages
are
not
of
such
rare
occurrence
with
us
as
elsewhere
a
son
will
sometimes
make
it
known
to
his
father
that
he
has
fallen
in
love
say
with
a
young
woman
in
the
factory
the
father
who
once
worked
in
a
factory
himself
will
be
a
little
disappointed
at
first
very
possibly
it
may
be
that
he
had
other
views
for
his
son
however
the
chances
are
that
having
ascertained
the
young
woman
to
be
of
unblemished
character
he
will
say
to
his
son
must
be
quite
sure
you
are
in
earnest
here
this
is
a
serious
matter
for
both
of
you
therefore
i
shall
have
this
girl
educated
for
two
years
or
it
may
be
shall
place
this
girl
at
the
same
school
with
your
sisters
for
such
a
time
during
which
you
will
give
me
your
word
and
honour
to
see
her
only
so
often
if
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
when
she
has
so
far
profited
by
her
advantages
as
that
you
may
be
upon
a
fair
equality
you
are
both
in
the
same
mind
i
will
do
my
part
to
make
you
happy
i
know
of
several
cases
such
as
i
describe
my
lady
and
i
think
they
indicate
to
me
my
own
course
now
sir
leicester
magnificence
explodes
calmly
but
terribly
rouncewell
says
sir
leicester
with
his
right
hand
in
the
breast
of
his
blue
coat
the
attitude
of
state
in
which
he
is
painted
in
the
gallery
do
you
draw
a
parallel
between
chesney
wold
and
a
here
he
resists
a
disposition
to
choke
a
factory
i
need
not
reply
sir
leicester
that
the
two
places
are
very
different
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
i
think
a
parallel
may
be
justly
drawn
between
them
sir
leicester
directs
his
majestic
glance
down
one
side
of
the
long
and
up
the
other
before
he
can
believe
that
he
is
awake
are
you
aware
sir
that
this
young
woman
whom
my
lady
my
lady
has
placed
near
her
person
was
brought
up
at
the
village
school
outside
the
gates
sir
leicester
i
am
quite
aware
of
it
a
very
good
school
it
is
and
handsomely
supported
by
this
family
then
rouncewell
returns
sir
leicester
the
application
of
what
you
have
said
is
to
me
incomprehensible
will
it
be
more
comprehensible
sir
leicester
if
i
say
the
ironmaster
is
reddening
a
little
that
i
do
not
regard
the
village
school
as
teaching
everything
desirable
to
be
known
by
my
wife
from
the
village
school
of
chesney
wold
intact
as
it
is
this
minute
to
the
whole
framework
of
society
from
the
whole
framework
of
society
to
the
aforesaid
framework
receiving
tremendous
cracks
in
consequence
of
people
and
what
not
not
minding
their
catechism
and
getting
out
of
the
station
unto
which
they
are
called
necessarily
and
for
ever
according
to
sir
leicester
rapid
logic
the
first
station
in
which
they
happen
to
find
themselves
and
from
that
to
their
educating
other
people
out
of
their
stations
and
so
obliterating
the
landmarks
and
opening
the
floodgates
and
all
the
rest
of
it
this
is
the
swift
progress
of
the
dedlock
mind
my
lady
i
beg
your
pardon
permit
me
for
one
moment
she
has
given
a
faint
indication
of
intending
to
speak
rouncewell
our
views
of
duty
and
our
views
of
station
and
our
views
of
education
and
our
views
of
in
short
all
our
views
are
so
diametrically
opposed
that
to
prolong
this
discussion
must
be
repellent
to
your
feelings
and
repellent
to
my
own
this
young
woman
is
honoured
with
my
lady
notice
and
favour
if
she
wishes
to
withdraw
herself
from
that
notice
and
favour
or
if
she
chooses
to
place
herself
under
the
influence
of
any
one
who
may
in
his
peculiar
opinions
you
will
allow
me
to
say
in
his
peculiar
opinions
though
i
readily
admit
that
he
is
not
accountable
for
them
to
me
who
may
in
his
peculiar
opinions
withdraw
her
from
that
notice
and
favour
she
is
at
any
time
at
liberty
to
do
so
we
are
obliged
to
you
for
the
plainness
with
which
you
have
spoken
it
will
have
no
effect
of
itself
one
way
or
other
on
the
young
woman
position
here
beyond
this
we
can
make
no
terms
and
here
we
beg
if
you
will
be
so
good
to
leave
the
subject
the
visitor
pauses
a
moment
to
give
my
lady
an
opportunity
but
she
says
nothing
he
then
rises
and
replies
sir
leicester
and
lady
dedlock
allow
me
to
thank
you
for
your
attention
and
only
to
observe
that
i
shall
very
seriously
recommend
my
son
to
conquer
his
present
inclinations
good
night
rouncewell
says
sir
leicester
with
all
the
nature
of
a
gentleman
shining
in
him
it
is
late
and
the
roads
are
dark
i
hope
your
time
is
not
so
precious
but
that
you
will
allow
my
lady
and
myself
to
offer
you
the
hospitality
of
chesney
wold
for
at
least
i
hope
so
adds
my
lady
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
have
to
travel
all
night
in
order
to
reach
a
distant
part
of
the
country
punctually
at
an
appointed
time
in
the
morning
therewith
the
ironmaster
takes
his
departure
sir
leicester
ringing
the
bell
and
my
lady
rising
as
he
leaves
the
room
when
my
lady
goes
to
her
boudoir
she
sits
down
thoughtfully
by
the
fire
and
inattentive
to
the
ghost
walk
looks
at
rosa
writing
in
an
inner
room
presently
my
lady
calls
her
come
to
me
child
tell
me
the
truth
are
you
in
love
oh
my
lady
my
lady
looking
at
the
downcast
and
blushing
face
says
smiling
who
is
it
is
it
rouncewell
grandson
yes
if
you
please
my
lady
but
i
do
know
that
i
am
in
love
with
him
yet
yet
you
silly
little
thing
do
you
know
that
he
loves
you
yet
i
think
he
likes
me
a
little
my
lady
and
rosa
bursts
into
tears
is
this
lady
dedlock
standing
beside
the
village
beauty
smoothing
her
dark
hair
with
that
motherly
touch
and
watching
her
with
eyes
so
full
of
musing
interest
aye
indeed
it
is
listen
to
me
child
you
are
young
and
true
and
i
believe
you
are
attached
to
me
indeed
i
am
my
lady
indeed
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
do
to
show
how
much
and
i
do
think
you
would
wish
to
leave
me
just
yet
rosa
even
for
a
lover
no
my
lady
oh
no
rosa
looks
up
for
the
first
time
quite
frightened
at
the
thought
confide
in
me
my
child
do
fear
me
i
wish
you
to
be
happy
and
will
make
you
so
if
i
can
make
anybody
happy
on
this
earth
rosa
with
fresh
tears
kneels
at
her
feet
and
kisses
her
hand
my
lady
takes
the
hand
with
which
she
has
caught
it
and
standing
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
puts
it
about
and
about
between
her
own
two
hands
and
gradually
lets
it
fall
seeing
her
so
absorbed
rosa
softly
withdraws
but
still
my
lady
eyes
are
on
the
fire
in
search
of
what
of
any
hand
that
is
no
more
of
any
hand
that
never
was
of
any
touch
that
might
have
magically
changed
her
life
or
does
she
listen
to
the
ghost
walk
and
think
what
step
does
it
most
resemble
a
man
a
woman
the
pattering
of
a
little
feet
ever
coming
on
on
on
some
melancholy
influence
is
upon
her
or
why
should
so
proud
a
lady
close
the
doors
and
sit
alone
upon
the
hearth
so
desolate
volumnia
is
away
next
day
and
all
the
cousins
are
scattered
before
dinner
not
a
cousin
of
the
batch
but
is
amazed
to
hear
from
sir
leicester
at
of
the
obliteration
of
landmarks
and
opening
of
floodgates
and
cracking
of
the
framework
of
society
manifested
through
rouncewell
son
not
a
cousin
of
the
batch
but
is
really
indignant
and
connects
it
with
the
feebleness
of
william
buffy
when
in
office
and
really
does
feel
deprived
of
a
stake
in
the
country
or
the
pension
list
or
something
by
fraud
and
wrong
as
to
volumnia
she
is
handed
down
the
great
staircase
by
sir
leicester
as
eloquent
upon
the
theme
as
if
there
were
a
general
rising
in

obtain
her

pearl
necklace

thus
with
a
clatter
of
maids
and
valets
for
it
is
one
appurtenance
of
their
cousinship
that
however
difficult
they
may
find
it
to
keep
themselves
they
must
keep
maids
and
valets
the
cousins
disperse
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
the
one
wintry
wind
that
blows
shakes
a
shower
from
the
trees
near
the
deserted
house
as
if
all
the
cousins
had
been
changed
into
leaves

rolled
into

in
corners
of

in

carving
and

puts
on
mortification
and
the
dedlock
ancestors
retire
from
the
light
of
day
again
around
and
around
the
house
the
leaves
fall
thick
but
never
fast
for
they
come
circling
down
with
a
dead
lightness
that
is
sombre
and
slow
let
the
gardener
sweep
and
sweep
the
turf
as
he
will
and
press
the
leaves
into
full
barrows
and
wheel
them
off

they

the

round

the
sharp

and
the
chimneys
growl
mists
hide
in

avenues
veil
the
points
of
view
and
move
in
across
the
rising
grounds
on
all
the
house
there
is
a
cold
blank
smell
like
the
smell
of
a
little
church
though
something
dryer
suggesting
that
the
dead
and
buried
dedlocks
walk
there
in
the
long
nights
and
leave
the
flavour
of
their
graves
behind
them
but
the
house
in
town
which
is
rarely
in
the
same
mind
as
chesney
wold
at
the
same
time
seldom
rejoicing
when
it
rejoices
or
mourning
when
it
mourns
excepting
when
a
dedlock
dies
the
house
in
town
shines
out
awakened
as
warm
and
bright
as
so
much
state
may
be
as
delicately
redolent
of
pleasant
scents
that
bear
no
trace
of
winter
as
hothouse
flowers
can
make
it
soft
and
hushed
so
that
the
ticking
of
the
clocks
and
the
crisp
burning
of
the
fires
alone
disturb
the
stillness
in
the
rooms
it
seems
to
wrap
those
chilled
bones
of
sir
leicester
in
wool
and
sir
leicester
is
glad
to
repose
in
dignified
contentment
before
the
great
fire
in
the
library
condescendingly
perusing
the
backs
of
his
books
or
honouring
the
fine
arts
with
a
glance
of
approbation
for
he
has
his
pictures
ancient
and
modern
some
of
the
fancy
ball
school
in
which
art
occasionally
condescends
to
become
a
master
which
would
be
best
catalogued
like
the
miscellaneous
articles
in
a
sale
as
three

a

and
othello
tulkinghorn
comes
and
goes
pretty
often
there
being
estate
business
to
do
leases
to
be
renewed
and
so
on
he
sees
my
lady
pretty
often
too
and
he
and
she
are
as
composed
and
as
indifferent
and
take
as
little
heed
of
one
another
as
ever
yet
it
may
be
that
my
lady
fears
this
tulkinghorn
and
that
he
knows
it
it
may
be
that
he
pursues
her
doggedly
and
steadily
with
no
touch
of
compunction
remorse
or
pity
it
may
be
that
her
beauty
and
all
the
state
and
brilliancy
surrounding
her
only
gives
him
the
greater
zest
for
what
he
is
set
upon
and
makes
him
the
more
inflexible
in
it
whether
he
be
cold
and
cruel
whether
immovable
in
what
he
has
made
his
duty
whether
absorbed
in
love
of
power
whether
determined
to
have
nothing
hidden
from
him
in
ground
where
he
has
burrowed
among
secrets
all
his
life
whether
he
in
his
heart
despises
the
splendour
of
which
he
is
a
distant
beam
whether
he
is
always
treasuring
up
slights
and
offences
in
the
affability
of
his
gorgeous
clients
whether
he
be
any
of
this
or
all
of
this
it
may
be
that
my
lady
had
better
have
five
thousand
pairs
of
fashionable
eyes
upon
her
in
distrustful
vigilance
than
the
two
eyes
of
this
rusty
lawyer
with
his
wisp
of
neckcloth
and
his
dull
black
breeches
tied
with
ribbons
at
the
knees
sir
leicester
sits
in
my
lady
room
that
room
in
which
tulkinghorn
read
the
affidavit
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
particularly
complacent
my
lady
as
on
that
day
sits
before
the
fire
with
her
screen
in
her
hand
sir
leicester
is
particularly
complacent
because
he
has
found
in
his
newspaper
some
congenial
remarks
bearing
directly
on
the
floodgates
and
the
framework
of
society
they
apply
so
happily
to
the
late
case
that
sir
leicester
has
come
from
the
library
to
my
lady
room
expressly
to
read
them
aloud
the
man
who
wrote
this
article
he
observes
by
way
of
preface
nodding
at
the
fire
as
if
he
were
nodding
down
at
the
man
from
a
mount
has
a
mind
the
man
mind
is
not
so
well
balanced
but
that
he
bores
my
lady
who
after
a
languid
effort
to
listen
or
rather
a
languid
resignation
of
herself
to
a
show
of
listening
becomes
distraught
and
falls
into
a
contemplation
of
the
fire
as
if
it
were
her
fire
at
chesney
wold
and
she
had
never
left
it
sir
leicester
quite
unconscious
reads
on
through
his
double
occasionally
stopping
to
remove
his
glass
and
express
approval
as
very
true
indeed
very
properly
put
i
have
frequently
made
the
same
remark
myself
invariably
losing
his
place
after
each
observation
and
going
up
and
down
the
column
to
find
it
again
sir
leicester
is
reading
with
infinite
gravity
and
state
when
the
door
opens
and
the
mercury
in
powder
makes
this
strange
announcement
the
young
man
my
lady
of
the
name
of
guppy
sir
leicester
pauses
stares
repeats
in
a
killing
voice
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
looking
round
he
beholds
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
much
discomfited
and
not
presenting
a
very
impressive
letter
of
introduction
in
his
manner
and
appearance
pray
says
sir
leicester
to
mercury
what
do
you
mean
by
announcing
with
this
abruptness
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
leicester
but
my
lady
said
she
would
see
the
young
man
whenever
he
called
i
was
not
aware
that
you
were
here
sir
leicester
with
this
apology
mercury
directs
a
scornful
and
indignant
look
at
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
which
plainly
says
what
do
you
come
calling
here
for
and
getting
me
into
a
row
it
quite
right
i
gave
him
those
directions
says
my
lady
let
the
young
man
wait
by
no
means
my
lady
since
he
has
your
orders
to
come
i
will
not
interrupt
you
sir
leicester
in
his
gallantry
retires
rather
declining
to
accept
a
bow
from
the
young
man
as
he
goes
out
and
majestically
supposing
him
to
be
some
shoemaker
of
intrusive
appearance
lady
dedlock
looks
imperiously
at
her
visitor
when
the
servant
has
left
the
room
casting
her
eyes
over
him
from
head
to
foot
she
suffers
him
to
stand
by
the
door
and
asks
him
what
he
wants
that
your
ladyship
would
have
the
kindness
to
oblige
me
with
a
little
conversation
returns
guppy
embarrassed
you
are
of
course
the
person
who
has
written
me
so
many
letters
several
your
ladyship
several
before
your
ladyship
condescended
to
favour
me
with
an
answer
and
could
you
not
take
the
same
means
of
rendering
a
conversation
unnecessary
can
you
not
still
guppy
screws
his
mouth
into
a
silent
no
and
shakes
his
head
you
have
been
strangely
importunate
if
it
should
appear
after
all
that
what
you
have
to
say
does
not
concern
me
and
i
do
know
how
it
can
and
do
expect
that
it
will
you
will
allow
me
to
cut
you
short
with
but
little
ceremony
say
what
you
have
to
say
if
you
please
my
lady
with
a
careless
toss
of
her
screen
turns
herself
towards
the
fire
again
sitting
almost
with
her
back
to
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
with
your
ladyship
permission
then
says
the
young
man
i
will
now
enter
on
my
business
hem
i
am
as
i
told
your
ladyship
in
my
first
letter
in
the
law
being
in
the
law
i
have
learnt
the
habit
of
not
committing
myself
in
writing
and
therefore
i
did
not
mention
to
your
ladyship
the
name
of
the
firm
with
which
i
am
connected
and
in
which
my
standing
and
i
may
add
income
is
tolerably
good
i
may
now
state
to
your
ladyship
in
confidence
that
the
name
of
that
firm
is
kenge
and
carboy
of
lincoln
inn
which
may
not
be
altogether
unknown
to
your
ladyship
in
connexion
with
the
case
in
chancery
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
my
lady
figure
begins
to
be
expressive
of
some
attention
she
has
ceased
to
toss
the
screen
and
holds
it
as
if
she
were
listening
now
i
may
say
to
your
ladyship
at
once
says
guppy
a
little
emboldened
it
is
no
matter
arising
out
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
that
made
me
so
desirous
to
speak
to
your
ladyship
which
conduct
i
have
no
doubt
did
appear
and
does
appear
obtrusive
in
fact
almost
blackguardly
after
waiting
for
a
moment
to
receive
some
assurance
to
the
contrary
and
not
receiving
any
guppy
proceeds
if
it
had
been
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
i
should
have
gone
at
once
to
your
solicitor
tulkinghorn
of
the
fields
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
tulkinghorn
at
least
we
move
when
we
meet
one
another
and
if
it
had
been
any
business
of
that
sort
i
should
have
gone
to
him
my
lady
turns
a
little
round
and
says
you
had
better
sit
down
thank
your
ladyship
guppy
does
so
now
your
ladyship
guppy
refers
to
a
little
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
has
made
small
notes
of
his
line
of
argument
and
which
seems
to
involve
him
in
the
densest
obscurity
whenever
he
looks
at
it
i
oh
yes
i
place
myself
entirely
in
your
ladyship
hands
if
your
ladyship
was
to
make
any
complaint
to
kenge
and
carboy
or
to
tulkinghorn
of
the
present
visit
i
should
be
placed
in
a
very
disagreeable
situation
that
i
openly
admit
consequently
i
rely
upon
your
honour
my
lady
with
a
disdainful
gesture
of
the
hand
that
holds
the
screen
assures
him
of
his
being
worth
no
complaint
from
her
thank
your
ladyship
says
guppy
quite
satisfactory
now
i
dash
it
the
fact
is
that
i
put
down
a
head
or
two
here
of
the
order
of
the
points
i
thought
of
touching
upon
and
written
short
and
i
ca
quite
make
out
what
they
mean
if
your
ladyship
will
excuse
me
taking
it
to
the
window
half
a
moment
i
guppy
going
to
the
window
tumbles
into
a
pair
of
to
whom
he
says
in
his
confusion
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
sure
this
does
not
tend
to
the
greater
legibility
of
his
notes
he
murmurs
growing
warm
and
red
and
holding
the
slip
of
paper
now
close
to
his
eyes
now
a
long
way
off
what
for
oh
oh
i
know
yes
to
be
sure
and
comes
back
enlightened
i
am
not
aware
says
guppy
standing
midway
between
my
lady
and
his
chair
whether
your
ladyship
ever
happened
to
hear
of
or
to
see
a
young
lady
of
the
name
of
miss
esther
summerson
my
lady
eyes
look
at
him
full
i
saw
a
young
lady
of
that
name
not
long
ago
this
past
autumn
now
did
it
strike
your
ladyship
that
she
was
like
anybody
asks
guppy
crossing
his
arms
holding
his
head
on
one
side
and
scratching
the
corner
of
his
mouth
with
his
memoranda
my
lady
removes
her
eyes
from
him
no
more
no
not
like
your
ladyship
family
no
i
think
your
ladyship
says
guppy
can
hardly
remember
miss
summerson
face
i
remember
the
young
lady
very
well
what
has
this
to
do
with
me
your
ladyship
i
do
assure
you
that
having
miss
summerson
image
imprinted
on
my
which
i
mention
in
confidence
i
found
when
i
had
the
honour
of
going
over
your
ladyship
mansion
of
chesney
wold
while
on
a
short
out
in
the
county
of
lincolnshire
with
a
friend
such
a
resemblance
between
miss
esther
summerson
and
your
own
portrait
that
it
completely
knocked
me
over
so
much
so
that
i
did
at
the
moment
even
know
what
it
was
that
knocked
me
over
and
now
i
have
the
honour
of
beholding
your
ladyship
near
i
have
often
since
that
taken
the
liberty
of
looking
at
your
ladyship
in
your
carriage
in
the
park
when
i
dare
say
you
was
not
aware
of
me
but
i
never
saw
your
ladyship
so
near
it
really
more
surprising
than
i
thought
it
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
there
have
been
times
when
ladies
lived
in
strongholds
and
had
unscrupulous
attendants
within
call
when
that
poor
life
of
yours
would
not
have
been
worth
a
purchase
with
those
beautiful
eyes
looking
at
you
as
they
look
at
this
moment
my
lady
slowly
using
her
little
as
a
fan
asks
him
again
what
he
supposes
that
his
taste
for
likenesses
has
to
do
with
her
your
ladyship
replies
guppy
again
referring
to
his
paper
i
am
coming
to
that
dash
these
notes
oh
chadband
yes
guppy
draws
his
chair
a
little
forward
and
seats
himself
again
my
lady
reclines
in
her
chair
composedly
though
with
a
trifle
less
of
graceful
ease
than
usual
perhaps
and
never
falters
in
her
steady
gaze
a
stop
a
minute
though
guppy
refers
again
twice
oh
yes
yes
i
see
my
way
now
right
on
rolling
up
the
slip
of
paper
as
an
instrument
to
point
his
speech
with
guppy
proceeds
your
ladyship
there
is
a
mystery
about
miss
esther
birth
and
bringing
up
i
am
informed
of
that
fact
because
which
i
mention
in
confidence
i
know
it
in
the
way
of
my
profession
at
kenge
and
carboy
now
as
i
have
already
mentioned
to
your
ladyship
miss
summerson
image
is
imprinted
on
my
if
i
could
clear
this
mystery
for
her
or
prove
her
to
be
well
related
or
find
that
having
the
honour
to
be
a
remote
branch
of
your
ladyship
family
she
had
a
right
to
be
made
a
party
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
why
i
might
make
a
sort
of
a
claim
upon
miss
summerson
to
look
with
an
eye
of
more
dedicated
favour
on
my
proposals
than
she
has
exactly
done
as
yet
in
fact
as
yet
she
has
favoured
them
at
all
a
kind
of
angry
smile
just
dawns
upon
my
lady
face
now
it
a
very
singular
circumstance
your
ladyship
says
guppy
though
one
of
those
circumstances
that
do
fall
in
the
way
of
us
professional
men
which
i
may
call
myself
for
though
not
admitted
yet
i
have
had
a
present
of
my
articles
made
to
me
by
kenge
and
carboy
on
my
mother
advancing
from
the
principal
of
her
little
income
the
money
for
the
stamp
which
comes
heavy
that
i
have
encountered
the
person
who
lived
as
servant
with
the
lady
who
brought
miss
summerson
up
before
jarndyce
took
charge
of
her
that
lady
was
a
miss
barbary
your
ladyship
is
the
dead
colour
on
my
lady
face
reflected
from
the
screen
which
has
a
green
silk
ground
and
which
she
holds
in
her
raised
hand
as
if
she
had
forgotten
it
or
is
it
a
dreadful
paleness
that
has
fallen
on
her
did
your
ladyship
says
guppy
ever
happen
to
hear
of
miss
barbary
i
do
know
i
think
so
yes
was
miss
barbary
at
all
connected
with
your
ladyship
family
my
lady
lips
move
but
they
utter
nothing
she
shakes
her
head
not
connected
says
guppy
oh
not
to
your
knowledge
perhaps
ah
but
might
be
yes
after
each
of
these
interrogatories
she
has
inclined
her
head
very
good
now
this
miss
barbary
was
extremely
close
seems
to
have
been
extraordinarily
close
for
a
female
females
being
generally
in
common
life
at
least
rather
given
to
conversation
and
my
witness
never
had
an
idea
whether
she
possessed
a
single
relative
on
one
occasion
and
only
one
she
seems
to
have
been
confidential
to
my
witness
on
a
single
point
and
she
then
told
her
that
the
little
girl
real
name
was
not
esther
summerson
but
esther
hawdon
my
god
guppy
stares
lady
dedlock
sits
before
him
looking
him
through
with
the
same
dark
shade
upon
her
face
in
the
same
attitude
even
to
the
holding
of
the
screen
with
her
lips
a
little
apart
her
brow
a
little
contracted
but
for
the
moment
dead
he
sees
her
consciousness
return
sees
a
tremor
pass
across
her
frame
like
a
ripple
over
water
sees
her
lips
shake
sees
her
compose
them
by
a
great
effort
sees
her
force
herself
back
to
the
knowledge
of
his
presence
and
of
what
he
has
said
all
this
so
quickly
that
her
exclamation
and
her
dead
condition
seem
to
have
passed
away
like
the
features
of
those
dead
bodies
sometimes
opened
up
in
tombs
which
struck
by
the
air
like
lightning
vanish
in
a
breath
your
ladyship
is
acquainted
with
the
name
of
hawdon
i
have
heard
it
before
name
of
any
collateral
or
remote
branch
of
your
ladyship
family
no
now
your
ladyship
says
guppy
i
come
to
the
last
point
of
the
case
so
far
as
i
have
got
it
up
it
going
on
and
i
shall
gather
it
up
closer
and
closer
as
it
goes
on
your
ladyship
must
know
if
your
ladyship
do
happen
by
any
chance
to
know
already
that
there
was
found
dead
at
the
house
of
a
person
named
krook
near
chancery
lane
some
time
ago
a
in
great
distress
upon
which
there
was
an
inquest
and
which
was
an
anonymous
character
his
name
being
unknown
but
your
ladyship
i
have
discovered
very
lately
that
that
name
was
hawdon
and
what
is
that
to
me
aye
your
ladyship
that
the
question
now
your
ladyship
a
queer
thing
happened
after
that
man
death
a
lady
started
up
a
disguised
lady
your
ladyship
who
went
to
look
at
the
scene
of
action
and
went
to
look
at
his
grave
she
hired
a
boy
to
show
it
her
if
your
ladyship
would
wish
to
have
the
boy
produced
in
corroboration
of
this
statement
i
can
lay
my
hand
upon
him
at
any
time
the
wretched
boy
is
nothing
to
my
lady
and
she
does
not
wish
to
have
him
produced
oh
i
assure
your
ladyship
it
a
very
queer
start
indeed
says
guppy
if
you
was
to
hear
him
tell
about
the
rings
that
sparkled
on
her
fingers
when
she
took
her
glove
off
you
think
it
quite
romantic
there
are
diamonds
glittering
on
the
hand
that
holds
the
screen
my
lady
trifles
with
the
screen
and
makes
them
glitter
more
again
with
that
expression
which
in
other
times
might
have
been
so
dangerous
to
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
it
was
supposed
your
ladyship
that
he
left
no
rag
or
scrap
behind
him
by
which
he
could
be
possibly
identified
but
he
did
he
left
a
bundle
of
old
letters
the
screen
still
goes
as
before
all
this
time
her
eyes
never
once
release
him
they
were
taken
and
secreted
and
night
your
ladyship
they
will
come
into
my
possession
still
i
ask
you
what
is
this
to
me
your
ladyship
i
conclude
with
that
guppy
rises
if
you
think
there
enough
in
this
chain
of
circumstances
put
together
in
the
undoubted
strong
likeness
of
this
young
lady
to
your
ladyship
which
is
a
positive
fact
for
a
jury
in
her
having
been
brought
up
by
miss
barbary
in
miss
barbary
stating
miss
summerson
real
name
to
be
hawdon
in
your
ladyship
knowing
both
these
names
very
well
and
in
hawdon
dying
as
he
did
to
give
your
ladyship
a
family
interest
in
going
further
into
the
case
i
will
bring
these
papers
here
i
know
what
they
are
except
that
they
are
old
letters
i
have
never
had
them
in
my
possession
yet
i
will
bring
those
papers
here
as
soon
as
i
get
them
and
go
over
them
for
the
first
time
with
your
ladyship
i
have
told
your
ladyship
my
object
i
have
told
your
ladyship
that
i
should
be
placed
in
a
very
disagreeable
situation
if
any
complaint
was
made
and
all
is
in
strict
confidence
is
this
the
full
purpose
of
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
or
has
he
any
other
do
his
words
disclose
the
length
breadth
depth
of
his
object
and
suspicion
in
coming
here
or
if
not
what
do
they
hide
he
is
a
match
for
my
lady
there
she
may
look
at
him
but
he
can
look
at
the
table
and
keep
that
face
of
his
from
telling
anything
you
may
bring
the
letters
says
my
lady
if
you
choose
your
ladyship
is
not
very
encouraging
upon
my
word
and
honour
says
guppy
a
little
injured
you
may
bring
the
letters
she
repeats
in
the
same
tone
if
you
please
it
shall
be
done
i
wish
your
ladyship
good
day
on
a
table
near
her
is
a
rich
bauble
of
a
casket
barred
and
clasped
like
an
old
she
looking
at
him
still
takes
it
to
her
and
unlocks
it
oh
i
assure
your
ladyship
i
am
not
actuated
by
any
motives
of
that
sort
says
guppy
and
i
could
accept
anything
of
the
kind
i
wish
your
ladyship
good
day
and
am
much
obliged
to
you
all
the
same
so
the
young
man
makes
his
bow
and
goes
downstairs
where
the
supercilious
mercury
does
not
consider
himself
called
upon
to
leave
his
olympus
by
the
to
let
the
young
man
out
as
sir
leicester
basks
in
his
library
and
dozes
over
his
newspaper
is
there
no
influence
in
the
house
to
startle
him
not
to
say
to
make
the
very
trees
at
chesney
wold
fling
up
their
knotted
arms
the
very
portraits
frown
the
very
armour
stir
no
words
sobs
and
cries
are
but
air
and
air
is
so
shut
in
and
shut
out
throughout
the
house
in
town
that
sounds
need
be
uttered
indeed
by
my
lady
in
her
chamber
to
carry
any
faint
vibration
to
sir
leicester
ears
and
yet
this
cry
is
in
the
house
going
upward
from
a
wild
figure
on
its
knees
o
my
child
my
child
not
dead
in
the
first
hours
of
her
life
as
my
cruel
sister
told
me
but
sternly
nurtured

her
after
she
had
renounced

chapter
xxx
esther
narrative
richard
had
been
gone
away
some
time
when
a
visitor
came
to
pass
a
few
days
with
us
it
was
an
elderly
lady
it
was
woodcourt
who
having
come
from
wales
to
stay
with
bayham
badger
and
having
written
to
my
guardian
by
her
son
allan
desire
to
report
that
she
had
heard
from
him
and
that
he
was
well
and
sent
his
kind
remembrances
to
all
of
us
had
been
invited
by
my
guardian
to
make
a
visit
to
bleak
house
she
stayed
with
us
nearly
three
weeks
she
took
very
kindly
to
me
and
was
extremely
confidential
so
much
so
that
sometimes
she
almost
made
me
uncomfortable
i
had
no
right
i
knew
very
well
to
be
uncomfortable
because
she
confided
in
me
and
i
felt
it
was
unreasonable
still
with
all
i
could
do
i
could
not
quite
help
it
she
was
such
a
sharp
little
lady
and
used
to
sit
with
her
hands
folded
in
each
other
looking
so
very
watchful
while
she
talked
to
me
that
perhaps
i
found
that
rather
irksome
or
perhaps
it
was
her
being
so
upright
and
trim
though
i
do
think
it
was
that
because
i
thought
that
quaintly
pleasant
nor
can
it
have
been
the
general
expression
of
her
face
which
was
very
sparkling
and
pretty
for
an
old
lady
i
do
know
what
it
was
or
at
least
if
i
do
now
i
thought
i
did
not
then
or
at
least
but
it
do
matter
of
a
night
when
i
was
going
upstairs
to
bed
she
would
invite
me
into
her
room
where
she
sat
before
the
fire
in
a
great
chair
and
dear
me
she
would
tell
me
about
morgan
until
i
was
quite
sometimes
she
recited
a
few
verses
from
crumlinwallinwer
and
the
mewlinnwillinwodd
if
those
are
the
right
names
which
i
dare
say
they
are
not
and
would
become
quite
fiery
with
the
sentiments
they
expressed
though
i
never
knew
what
they
were
being
in
welsh
further
than
that
they
were
highly
eulogistic
of
the
lineage
of
morgan
so
miss
summerson
she
would
say
to
me
with
stately
triumph
this
you
see
is
the
fortune
inherited
by
my
son
wherever
my
son
goes
he
can
claim
kindred
with
he
may
not
have
money
but
he
always
has
what
is
much
better
family
my
dear
i
had
my
doubts
of
their
caring
so
very
much
for
morgan
in
india
and
china
but
of
course
i
never
expressed
them
i
used
to
say
it
was
a
great
thing
to
be
so
highly
connected
it
is
my
dear
a
great
thing
woodcourt
would
reply
it
has
its
disadvantages
my
son
choice
of
a
wife
for
instance
is
limited
by
it
but
the
matrimonial
choice
of
the
royal
family
is
limited
in
much
the
same
manner
then
she
would
pat
me
on
the
arm
and
smooth
my
dress
as
much
as
to
assure
me
that
she
had
a
good
opinion
of
me
the
distance
between
us
notwithstanding
poor
woodcourt
my
dear
she
would
say
and
always
with
some
emotion
for
with
her
lofty
pedigree
she
had
a
very
affectionate
heart
was
descended
from
a
great
highland
family
the
maccoorts
of
maccoort
he
served
his
king
and
country
as
an
officer
in
the
royal
highlanders
and
he
died
on
the
field
my
son
is
one
of
the
last
representatives
of
two
old
families
with
the
blessing
of
heaven
he
will
set
them
up
again
and
unite
them
with
another
old
family
it
was
in
vain
for
me
to
try
to
change
the
subject
as
i
used
to
try
only
for
the
sake
of
novelty
or
perhaps
because
but
i
need
not
be
so
particular
woodcourt
never
would
let
me
change
it
my
dear
she
said
one
night
you
have
so
much
sense
and
you
look
at
the
world
in
a
quiet
manner
so
superior
to
your
time
of
life
that
it
is
a
comfort
to
me
to
talk
to
you
about
these
family
matters
of
mine
you
do
know
much
of
my
son
my
dear
but
you
know
enough
of
him
i
dare
say
to
recollect
him
yes
i
recollect
him
yes
my
dear
now
my
dear
i
think
you
are
a
judge
of
character
and
i
should
like
to
have
your
opinion
of
him
oh
woodcourt
said
i
that
is
so
difficult
why
is
it
so
difficult
my
dear
she
returned
i
do
see
it
myself
to
give
an
opinion
on
so
slight
an
acquaintance
my
dear
that
true
i
did
mean
that
because
woodcourt
had
been
at
our
house
a
good
deal
altogether
and
had
become
quite
intimate
with
my
guardian
i
said
so
and
added
that
he
seemed
to
be
very
clever
in
his
profession
we
thought
and
that
his
kindness
and
gentleness
to
miss
flite
were
above
all
praise
you
do
him
justice
said
woodcourt
pressing
my
hand
you
define
him
exactly
allan
is
a
dear
fellow
and
in
his
profession
faultless
i
say
it
though
i
am
his
mother
still
i
must
confess
he
is
not
without
faults
love
none
of
us
are
said
i
ah
but
his
really
are
faults
that
he
might
correct
and
ought
to
correct
returned
the
sharp
old
lady
sharply
shaking
her
head
i
am
so
much
attached
to
you
that
i
may
confide
in
you
my
dear
as
a
third
party
wholly
disinterested
that
he
is
fickleness
itself
i
said
i
should
have
thought
it
hardly
possible
that
he
could
have
been
otherwise
than
constant
to
his
profession
and
zealous
in
the
pursuit
of
it
judging
from
the
reputation
he
had
earned
you
are
right
again
my
dear
the
old
lady
retorted
but
i
refer
to
his
profession
look
you
oh
said
i
no
said
she
i
refer
my
dear
to
his
social
conduct
he
is
always
paying
trivial
attentions
to
young
ladies
and
always
has
been
ever
since
he
was
eighteen
now
my
dear
he
has
never
really
cared
for
any
one
of
them
and
has
never
meant
in
doing
this
to
do
any
harm
or
to
express
anything
but
politeness
and
good
nature
still
it
not
right
you
know
is
it
no
said
i
as
she
seemed
to
wait
for
me
and
it
might
lead
to
mistaken
notions
you
see
my
dear
i
supposed
it
might
therefore
i
have
told
him
many
times
that
he
really
should
be
more
careful
both
in
justice
to
himself
and
in
justice
to
others
and
he
has
always
said
i
will
be
but
you
know
me
better
than
anybody
else
does
and
you
know
i
mean
no
harm
in
short
mean
nothing
all
of
which
is
very
true
my
dear
but
is
no
justification
however
as
he
is
now
gone
so
far
away
and
for
an
indefinite
time
and
as
he
will
have
good
opportunities
and
introductions
we
may
consider
this
past
and
gone
and
you
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
who
was
now
all
nods
and
smiles
regarding
your
dear
self
my
love
me
mrs
woodcourt
not
to
be
always
selfish
talking
of
my
son
who
has
gone
to
seek
his
fortune
and
to
find
a
wife
when
do
you
mean
to
seek
your
fortune
and
to
find
a
husband
miss
summerson
hey
look
you
now
you
blush
i
do
think
i
did
blush
at
all
events
it
was
not
important
if
i
did
and
i
said
my
present
fortune
perfectly
contented
me
and
i
had
no
wish
to
change
it
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
always
think
of
you
and
the
fortune
yet
to
come
for
you
my
love
said
woodcourt
if
you
believe
you
are
a
good
prophet
said
i
why
then
it
is
that
you
will
marry
some
one
very
rich
and
very
worthy
much
older
five
and
twenty
years
perhaps
than
yourself
and
you
will
be
an
excellent
wife
and
much
beloved
and
very
happy
that
is
a
good
fortune
said
i
but
why
is
it
to
be
mine
my
dear
she
returned
there
suitability
in
it
you
are
so
busy
and
so
neat
and
so
peculiarly
situated
altogether
that
suitability
in
it
and
it
will
come
to
pass
and
nobody
my
love
will
congratulate
you
more
sincerely
on
such
a
marriage
than
i
shall
it
was
curious
that
this
should
make
me
uncomfortable
but
i
think
it
did
i
know
it
did
it
made
me
for
some
part
of
that
night
uncomfortable
i
was
so
ashamed
of
my
folly
that
i
did
not
like
to
confess
it
even
to
ada
and
that
made
me
more
uncomfortable
still
i
would
have
given
anything
not
to
have
been
so
much
in
the
bright
old
lady
confidence
if
i
could
have
possibly
declined
it
it
gave
me
the
most
inconsistent
opinions
of
her
at
one
time
i
thought
she
was
a
and
at
another
time
that
she
was
the
pink
of
truth
now
i
suspected
that
she
was
very
cunning
next
moment
i
believed
her
honest
welsh
heart
to
be
perfectly
innocent
and
simple
and
after
all
what
did
it
matter
to
me
and
why
did
it
matter
to
me
why
could
not
i
going
up
to
bed
with
my
basket
of
keys
stop
to
sit
down
by
her
fire
and
accommodate
myself
for
a
little
while
to
her
at
least
as
well
as
to
anybody
else
and
not
trouble
myself
about
the
harmless
things
she
said
to
me
impelled
towards
her
as
i
certainly
was
for
i
was
very
anxious
that
she
should
like
me
and
was
very
glad
indeed
that
she
did
why
should
i
harp
afterwards
with
actual
distress
and
pain
on
every
word
she
said
and
weigh
it
over
and
over
again
in
twenty
scales
why
was
it
so
worrying
to
me
to
have
her
in
our
house
and
confidential
to
me
every
night
when
i
yet
felt
that
it
was
better
and
safer
somehow
that
she
should
be
there
than
anywhere
else
these
were
perplexities
and
contradictions
that
i
could
not
account
for
at
least
if
i
could
but
i
shall
come
to
all
that
by
and
by
and
it
is
mere
idleness
to
go
on
about
it
now
so
when
woodcourt
went
away
i
was
sorry
to
lose
her
but
was
relieved
too
and
then
caddy
jellyby
came
down
and
caddy
brought
such
a
packet
of
domestic
news
that
it
gave
us
abundant
occupation
first
caddy
declared
and
would
at
first
declare
nothing
else
that
i
was
the
best
adviser
that
ever
was
known
this
my
pet
said
was
no
news
at
all
and
this
i
said
of
course
was
nonsense
then
caddy
told
us
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
in
a
month
and
that
if
ada
and
i
would
be
her
bridesmaids
she
was
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
to
be
sure
this
was
news
indeed
and
i
thought
we
never
should
have
done
talking
about
it
we
had
so
much
to
say
to
caddy
and
caddy
had
so
much
to
say
to
us
it
seemed
that
caddy
unfortunate
papa
had
got
over
his
bankruptcy
gone
through
the
gazette
was
the
expression
caddy
used
as
if
it
were
a
tunnel
with
the
general
clemency
and
commiseration
of
his
creditors
and
had
got
rid
of
his
affairs
in
some
blessed
manner
without
succeeding
in
understanding
them
and
had
given
up
everything
he
possessed
which
was
not
worth
much
i
should
think
to
judge
from
the
state
of
the
furniture
and
had
satisfied
every
one
concerned
that
he
could
do
no
more
poor
man
so
he
had
been
honourably
dismissed
to
the
office
to
begin
the
world
again
what
he
did
at
the
office
i
never
knew
caddy
said
he
was
a
and
general
agent
and
the
only
thing
i
ever
understood
about
that
business
was
that
when
he
wanted
money
more
than
usual
he
went
to
the
docks
to
look
for
it
and
hardly
ever
found
it
as
soon
as
her
papa
had
tranquillized
his
mind
by
becoming
this
shorn
lamb
and
they
had
removed
to
a
furnished
lodging
in
hatton
garden
where
i
found
the
children
when
i
afterwards
went
there
cutting
the
horse
hair
out
of
the
seats
of
the
chairs
and
choking
themselves
with
it
caddy
had
brought
about
a
meeting
between
him
and
old
turveydrop
and
poor
jellyby
being
very
humble
and
meek
had
deferred
to
turveydrop
deportment
so
submissively
that
they
had
become
excellent
friends
by
degrees
old
turveydrop
thus
familiarized
with
the
idea
of
his
son
marriage
had
worked
up
his
parental
feelings
to
the
height
of
contemplating
that
event
as
being
near
at
hand
and
had
given
his
gracious
consent
to
the
young
couple
commencing
housekeeping
at
the
academy
in
newman
street
when
they
would
and
your
papa
caddy
what
did
he
say
oh
poor
pa
said
caddy
only
cried
and
said
he
hoped
we
might
get
on
better
than
he
and
ma
had
got
on
he
did
say
so
before
prince
he
only
said
so
to
me
and
he
said
poor
girl
you
have
not
been
very
well
taught
how
to
make
a
home
for
your
husband
but
unless
you
mean
with
all
your
heart
to
strive
to
do
it
you
had
better
murder
him
than
marry
him
if
you
really
love
him
and
how
did
you
reassure
him
caddy
why
it
was
very
distressing
you
know
to
see
poor
pa
so
low
and
hear
him
say
such
terrible
things
and
i
could
help
crying
myself
but
i
told
him
that
i
did
mean
it
with
all
my
heart
and
that
i
hoped
our
house
would
be
a
place
for
him
to
come
and
find
some
comfort
in
of
an
evening
and
that
i
hoped
and
thought
i
could
be
a
better
daughter
to
him
there
than
at
home
then
i
mentioned
peepy
coming
to
stay
with
me
and
then
pa
began
to
cry
again
and
said
the
children
were
indians
indians
caddy
yes
said
caddy
wild
indians
and
pa
said
here
she
began
to
sob
poor
girl
not
at
all
like
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
that
he
was
sensible
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
them
was
their
being
all
tomahawked
together
ada
suggested
that
it
was
comfortable
to
know
that
jellyby
did
not
mean
these
destructive
sentiments
no
of
course
i
know
pa
would
like
his
family
to
be
weltering
in
their
blood
said
caddy
but
he
means
that
they
are
very
unfortunate
in
being
ma
children
and
that
he
is
very
unfortunate
in
being
ma
husband
and
i
am
sure
that
true
though
it
seems
unnatural
to
say
so
i
asked
caddy
if
jellyby
knew
that
her
was
fixed
oh
you
know
what
ma
is
esther
she
returned
it
impossible
to
say
whether
she
knows
it
or
not
she
has
been
told
it
often
enough
and
when
she
is
told
it
she
only
gives
me
a
placid
look
as
if
i
was
i
do
know
what
a
steeple
in
the
distance
said
caddy
with
a
sudden
idea
and
then
she
shakes
her
head
and
says
caddy
caddy
what
a
tease
you
are
and
goes
on
with
the
borrioboola
letters
and
about
your
wardrobe
caddy
said
i
for
she
was
under
no
restraint
with
us
well
my
dear
esther
she
returned
drying
her
eyes
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
and
trust
to
my
dear
prince
never
to
have
an
unkind
remembrance
of
my
coming
so
shabbily
to
him
if
the
question
concerned
an
outfit
for
borrioboola
ma
would
know
all
about
it
and
would
be
quite
excited
being
what
it
is
she
neither
knows
nor
cares
caddy
was
not
at
all
deficient
in
natural
affection
for
her
mother
but
mentioned
this
with
tears
as
an
undeniable
fact
which
i
am
afraid
it
was
we
were
sorry
for
the
poor
dear
girl
and
found
so
much
to
admire
in
the
good
disposition
which
had
survived
under
such
discouragement
that
we
both
at
once
i
mean
ada
and
i
proposed
a
little
scheme
that
made
her
perfectly
joyful
this
was
her
staying
with
us
for
three
weeks
my
staying
with
her
for
one
and
our
all
three
contriving
and
cutting
out
and
repairing
and
sewing
and
saving
and
doing
the
very
best
we
could
think
of
to
make
the
most
of
her
stock
my
guardian
being
as
pleased
with
the
idea
as
caddy
was
we
took
her
home
next
day
to
arrange
the
matter
and
brought
her
out
again
in
triumph
with
her
boxes
and
all
the
purchases
that
could
be
squeezed
out
of
a
note
which
jellyby
had
found
in
the
docks
i
suppose
but
which
he
at
all
events
gave
her
what
my
guardian
would
not
have
given
her
if
we
had
encouraged
him
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
but
we
thought
it
right
to
compound
for
no
more
than
her
and
bonnet
he
agreed
to
this
compromise
and
if
caddy
had
ever
been
happy
in
her
life
she
was
happy
when
we
sat
down
to
work
she
was
clumsy
enough
with
her
needle
poor
girl
and
pricked
her
fingers
as
much
as
she
had
been
used
to
ink
them
she
could
not
help
reddening
a
little
now
and
then
partly
with
the
smart
and
partly
with
vexation
at
being
able
to
do
no
better
but
she
soon
got
over
that
and
began
to
improve
rapidly
so
day
after
day
she
and
my
darling
and
my
little
maid
charley
and
a
milliner
out
of
the
town
and
i
sat
hard
at
work
as
pleasantly
as
possible
over
and
above
this
caddy
was
very
anxious
to
learn
housekeeping
as
she
said
now
mercy
upon
us
the
idea
of
her
learning
housekeeping
of
a
person
of
my
vast
experience
was
such
a
joke
that
i
laughed
and
coloured
up
and
fell
into
a
comical
confusion
when
she
proposed
it
however
i
said
caddy
i
am
sure
you
are
very
welcome
to
learn
anything
that
you
can
learn
of
me
my
dear
and
i
showed
her
all
my
books
and
methods
and
all
my
fidgety
ways
you
would
have
supposed
that
i
was
showing
her
some
wonderful
inventions
by
her
study
of
them
and
if
you
had
seen
her
whenever
i
jingled
my
housekeeping
keys
get
up
and
attend
me
certainly
you
might
have
thought
that
there
never
was
a
greater
imposter
than
i
with
a
blinder
follower
than
caddy
jellyby
so
what
with
working
and
housekeeping
and
lessons
to
charley
and
backgammon
in
the
evening
with
my
guardian
and
duets
with
ada
the
three
weeks
slipped
fast
away
then
i
went
home
with
caddy
to
see
what
could
be
done
there
and
ada
and
charley
remained
behind
to
take
care
of
my
guardian
when
i
say
i
went
home
with
caddy
i
mean
to
the
furnished
lodging
in
hatton
garden
we
went
to
newman
street
two
or
three
times
where
preparations
were
in
progress
too
a
good
many
i
observed
for
enhancing
the
comforts
of
old
turveydrop
and
a
few
for
putting
the
newly
married
couple
away
cheaply
at
the
top
of
the
house
but
our
great
point
was
to
make
the
furnished
lodging
decent
for
the
and
to
imbue
jellyby
beforehand
with
some
faint
sense
of
the
occasion
the
latter
was
the
more
difficult
thing
of
the
two
because
jellyby
and
an
unwholesome
boy
occupied
the
front
the
back
one
was
a
mere
closet
and
it
was
littered
down
with
and
borrioboolan
documents
as
an
untidy
stable
might
be
littered
with
straw
jellyby
sat
there
all
day
drinking
strong
coffee
dictating
and
holding
borrioboolan
interviews
by
appointment
the
unwholesome
boy
who
seemed
to
me
to
be
going
into
a
decline
took
his
meals
out
of
the
house
when
jellyby
came
home
he
usually
groaned
and
went
down
into
the
kitchen
there
he
got
something
to
eat
if
the
servant
would
give
him
anything
and
then
feeling
that
he
was
in
the
way
went
out
and
walked
about
hatton
garden
in
the
wet
the
poor
children
scrambled
up
and
tumbled
down
the
house
as
they
had
always
been
accustomed
to
do
the
production
of
these
devoted
little
sacrifices
in
any
presentable
condition
being
quite
out
of
the
question
at
a
week
notice
i
proposed
to
caddy
that
we
should
make
them
as
happy
as
we
could
on
her
marriage
morning
in
the
attic
where
they
all
slept
and
should
confine
our
greatest
efforts
to
her
mama
and
her
mama
room
and
a
clean
breakfast
in
truth
jellyby
required
a
good
deal
of
attention
the
up
her
back
having
widened
considerably
since
i
first
knew
her
and
her
hair
looking
like
the
mane
of
a
dustman
horse
thinking
that
the
display
of
caddy
wardrobe
would
be
the
best
means
of
approaching
the
subject
i
invited
jellyby
to
come
and
look
at
it
spread
out
on
caddy
bed
in
the
evening
after
the
unwholesome
boy
was
gone
my
dear
miss
summerson
said
she
rising
from
her
desk
with
her
usual
sweetness
of
temper
these
are
really
ridiculous
preparations
though
your
assisting
them
is
a
proof
of
your
kindness
there
is
something
so
inexpressibly
absurd
to
me
in
the
idea
of
caddy
being
married
oh
caddy
you
silly
silly
silly
puss
she
came
upstairs
with
us
notwithstanding
and
looked
at
the
clothes
in
her
customary
manner
they
suggested
one
distinct
idea
to
her
for
she
said
with
her
placid
smile
and
shaking
her
head
my
good
miss
summerson
at
half
the
cost
this
weak
child
might
have
been
equipped
for
africa
on
our
going
downstairs
again
jellyby
asked
me
whether
this
troublesome
business
was
really
to
take
place
next
wednesday
and
on
my
replying
yes
she
said
will
my
room
be
required
my
dear
miss
summerson
for
it
quite
impossible
that
i
can
put
my
papers
away
i
took
the
liberty
of
saying
that
the
room
would
certainly
be
wanted
and
that
i
thought
we
must
put
the
papers
away
somewhere
well
my
dear
miss
summerson
said
jellyby
you
know
best
i
dare
say
but
by
obliging
me
to
employ
a
boy
caddy
has
embarrassed
me
to
that
extent
overwhelmed
as
i
am
with
public
business
that
i
do
know
which
way
to
turn
we
have
a
ramification
meeting
too
on
wednesday
afternoon
and
the
inconvenience
is
very
serious
it
is
not
likely
to
occur
again
said
i
smiling
caddy
will
be
married
but
once
probably
that
true
jellyby
replied
that
true
my
dear
i
suppose
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
the
next
question
was
how
jellyby
should
be
dressed
on
the
occasion
i
thought
it
very
curious
to
see
her
looking
on
serenely
from
her
while
caddy
and
i
discussed
it
occasionally
shaking
her
head
at
us
with
a
smile
like
a
superior
spirit
who
could
just
bear
with
our
trifling
the
state
in
which
her
dresses
were
and
the
extraordinary
confusion
in
which
she
kept
them
added
not
a
little
to
our
difficulty
but
at
length
we
devised
something
not
very
unlike
what
a
mother
might
wear
on
such
an
occasion
the
abstracted
manner
in
which
jellyby
would
deliver
herself
up
to
having
this
attire
tried
on
by
the
dressmaker
and
the
sweetness
with
which
she
would
then
observe
to
me
how
sorry
she
was
that
i
had
not
turned
my
thoughts
to
africa
were
consistent
with
the
rest
of
her
behaviour
the
lodging
was
rather
confined
as
to
space
but
i
fancied
that
if
jellyby
household
had
been
the
only
lodgers
in
saint
paul
or
saint
peter
the
sole
advantage
they
would
have
found
in
the
size
of
the
building
would
have
been
its
affording
a
great
deal
of
room
to
be
dirty
in
i
believe
that
nothing
belonging
to
the
family
which
it
had
been
possible
to
break
was
unbroken
at
the
time
of
those
preparations
for
caddy
marriage
that
nothing
which
it
had
been
possible
to
spoil
in
any
way
was
unspoilt
and
that
no
domestic
object
which
was
capable
of
collecting
dirt
from
a
dear
child
knee
to
the
was
without
as
much
dirt
as
could
well
accumulate
upon
it
poor
jellyby
who
very
seldom
spoke
and
almost
always
sat
when
he
was
at
home
with
his
head
against
the
wall
became
interested
when
he
saw
that
caddy
and
i
were
attempting
to
establish
some
order
among
all
this
waste
and
ruin
and
took
off
his
coat
to
help
but
such
wonderful
things
came
tumbling
out
of
the
closets
when
they
were
opened
bits
of
mouldy
pie
sour
bottles
jellyby
caps
letters
tea
forks
odd
boots
and
shoes
of
children
firewood
wafers
damp
sugar
in
odds
and
ends
of
paper
bags
footstools
blacklead
brushes
bread
jellyby
bonnets
books
with
butter
sticking
to
the
binding
guttered
candle
ends
put
out
by
being
turned
upside
down
in
broken
candlesticks
nutshells
heads
and
tails
of
shrimps
gloves
umbrellas
that
he
looked
frightened
and
left
off
again
but
he
came
regularly
every
evening
and
sat
without
his
coat
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
though
he
would
have
helped
us
if
he
had
known
how
poor
pa
said
caddy
to
me
on
the
night
before
the
great
day
when
we
really
had
got
things
a
little
to
rights
it
seems
unkind
to
leave
him
esther
but
what
could
i
do
if
i
stayed
since
i
first
knew
you
i
have
tidied
and
tidied
over
and
over
again
but
useless
ma
and
africa
together
upset
the
whole
house
directly
we
never
have
a
servant
who
do
drink
ma
ruinous
to
everything
jellyby
could
not
hear
what
she
said
but
he
seemed
very
low
indeed
and
shed
tears
i
thought
my
heart
aches
for
him
that
it
does
sobbed
caddy
i
ca
help
thinking
esther
how
dearly
i
hope
to
be
happy
with
prince
and
how
dearly
pa
hoped
i
dare
say
to
be
happy
with
ma
what
a
disappointed
life
my
dear
caddy
said
jellyby
looking
slowly
round
from
the
wail
it
was
the
first
time
i
think
i
ever
heard
him
say
three
words
together
yes
pa
cried
caddy
going
to
him
and
embracing
him
affectionately
my
dear
caddy
said
jellyby
never
have
not
prince
pa
faltered
caddy
not
have
prince
yes
my
dear
said
jellyby
have
him
certainly
but
never
have
i
mentioned
in
my
account
of
our
first
visit
in
thavies
inn
that
richard
described
jellyby
as
frequently
opening
his
mouth
after
dinner
without
saying
anything
it
was
a
habit
of
his
he
opened
his
mouth
now
a
great
many
times
and
shook
his
head
in
a
melancholy
manner
what
do
you
wish
me
not
to
have
do
have
what
dear
pa
asked
caddy
coaxing
him
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
never
have
a
mission
my
dear
child
jellyby
groaned
and
laid
his
head
against
the
wall
again
and
this
was
the
only
time
i
ever
heard
him
make
any
approach
to
expressing
his
sentiments
on
the
borrioboolan
question
i
suppose
he
had
been
more
talkative
and
lively
once
but
he
seemed
to
have
been
completely
exhausted
long
before
i
knew
him
i
thought
jellyby
never
would
have
left
off
serenely
looking
over
her
papers
and
drinking
coffee
that
night
it
was
twelve
before
we
could
obtain
possession
of
the
room
and
the
clearance
it
required
then
was
so
discouraging
that
caddy
who
was
almost
tired
out
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
dust
and
cried
but
she
soon
cheered
up
and
we
did
wonders
with
it
before
we
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
it
looked
by
the
aid
of
a
few
flowers
and
a
quantity
of
soap
and
water
and
a
little
arrangement
quite
gay
the
plain
breakfast
made
a
cheerful
show
and
caddy
was
perfectly
charming
but
when
my
darling
came
i
thought
and
i
think
now
that
i
never
had
seen
such
a
dear
face
as
my
beautiful
pet
we
made
a
little
feast
for
the
children
upstairs
and
we
put
peepy
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
we
showed
them
caddy
in
her
bridal
dress
and
they
clapped
their
hands
and
hurrahed
and
caddy
cried
to
think
that
she
was
going
away
from
them
and
hugged
them
over
and
over
again
until
we
brought
prince
up
to
fetch
her
away
when
i
am
sorry
to
say
peepy
bit
him
then
there
was
old
turveydrop
downstairs
in
a
state
of
deportment
not
to
be
expressed
benignly
blessing
caddy
and
giving
my
guardian
to
understand
that
his
son
happiness
was
his
own
parental
work
and
that
he
sacrificed
personal
considerations
to
ensure
it
my
dear
sir
said
turveydrop
these
young
people
will
live
with
me
my
house
is
large
enough
for
their
accommodation
and
they
shall
not
want
the
shelter
of
my
roof
i
could
have
wished
you
will
understand
the
allusion
jarndyce
for
you
remember
my
illustrious
patron
the
prince
regent
i
could
have
wished
that
my
son
had
married
into
a
family
where
there
was
more
deportment
but
the
will
of
heaven
be
done
and
pardiggle
were
of
the
party
pardiggle
an
man
with
a
large
waistcoat
and
stubbly
hair
who
was
always
talking
in
a
loud
bass
voice
about
his
mite
or
pardiggle
mite
or
their
five
boys
mites
quale
with
his
hair
brushed
back
as
usual
and
his
knobs
of
temples
shining
very
much
was
also
there
not
in
the
character
of
a
disappointed
lover
but
as
the
accepted
of
a
young
at
least
an
unmarried
lady
a
miss
wisk
who
was
also
there
miss
wisk
mission
my
guardian
said
was
to
show
the
world
that
woman
mission
was
man
mission
and
that
the
only
genuine
mission
of
both
man
and
woman
was
to
be
always
moving
declaratory
resolutions
about
things
in
general
at
public
meetings
the
guests
were
few
but
were
as
one
might
expect
at
jellyby
all
devoted
to
public
objects
only
besides
those
i
have
mentioned
there
was
an
extremely
dirty
lady
with
her
bonnet
all
awry
and
the
ticketed
price
of
her
dress
still
sticking
on
it
whose
neglected
home
caddy
told
me
was
like
a
filthy
wilderness
but
whose
church
was
like
a
fancy
fair
a
very
contentious
gentleman
who
said
it
was
his
mission
to
be
everybody
brother
but
who
appeared
to
be
on
terms
of
coolness
with
the
whole
of
his
large
family
completed
the
party
a
party
having
less
in
common
with
such
an
occasion
could
hardly
have
been
got
together
by
any
ingenuity
such
a
mean
mission
as
the
domestic
mission
was
the
very
last
thing
to
be
endured
among
them
indeed
miss
wisk
informed
us
with
great
indignation
before
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
that
the
idea
of
woman
mission
lying
chiefly
in
the
narrow
sphere
of
home
was
an
outrageous
slander
on
the
part
of
her
tyrant
man
one
other
singularity
was
that
nobody
with
a
mission
except
quale
whose
mission
as
i
think
i
have
formerly
said
was
to
be
in
ecstasies
with
everybody
mission
cared
at
all
for
anybody
mission
pardiggle
being
as
clear
that
the
only
one
infallible
course
was
her
course
of
pouncing
upon
the
poor
and
applying
benevolence
to
them
like
a
as
miss
wisk
was
that
the
only
practical
thing
for
the
world
was
the
emancipation
of
woman
from
the
thraldom
of
her
tyrant
man
jellyby
all
the
while
sat
smiling
at
the
limited
vision
that
could
see
anything
but
but
i
am
anticipating
now
the
purport
of
our
conversation
on
the
ride
home
instead
of
first
marrying
caddy
we
all
went
to
church
and
jellyby
gave
her
away
of
the
air
with
which
old
turveydrop
with
his
hat
under
his
left
arm
the
inside
presented
at
the
clergyman
like
a
cannon
and
his
eyes
creasing
themselves
up
into
his
wig
stood
stiff
and
behind
us
bridesmaids
during
the
ceremony
and
afterwards
saluted
us
i
could
never
say
enough
to
do
it
justice
miss
wisk
whom
i
can
not
report
as
prepossessing
in
appearance
and
whose
manner
was
grim
listened
to
the
proceedings
as
part
of
woman
wrongs
with
a
disdainful
face
jellyby
with
her
calm
smile
and
her
bright
eyes
looked
the
least
concerned
of
all
the
company
we
duly
came
back
to
breakfast
and
jellyby
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
jellyby
at
the
foot
caddy
had
previously
stolen
upstairs
to
hug
the
children
again
and
tell
them
that
her
name
was
turveydrop
but
this
piece
of
information
instead
of
being
an
agreeable
surprise
to
peepy
threw
him
on
his
back
in
such
transports
of
kicking
grief
that
i
could
do
nothing
on
being
sent
for
but
accede
to
the
proposal
that
he
should
be
admitted
to
the
breakfast
table
so
he
came
down
and
sat
in
my
lap
and
jellyby
after
saying
in
reference
to
the
state
of
his
pinafore
oh
you
naughty
peepy
what
a
shocking
little
pig
you
are
was
not
at
all
discomposed
he
was
very
good
except
that
he
brought
down
noah
with
him
out
of
an
ark
i
had
given
him
before
we
went
to
church
and
would
dip
him
head
first
into
the
and
then
put
him
in
his
mouth
my
guardian
with
his
sweet
temper
and
his
quick
perception
and
his
amiable
face
made
something
agreeable
even
out
of
the
ungenial
company
none
of
them
seemed
able
to
talk
about
anything
but
his
or
her
own
one
subject
and
none
of
them
seemed
able
to
talk
about
even
that
as
part
of
a
world
in
which
there
was
anything
else
but
my
guardian
turned
it
all
to
the
merry
encouragement
of
caddy
and
the
honour
of
the
occasion
and
brought
us
through
the
breakfast
nobly
what
we
should
have
done
without
him
i
am
afraid
to
think
for
all
the
company
despising
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
old
turveydrop
and
old
thurveydrop
in
virtue
of
his
deportment
considering
himself
vastly
superior
to
all
the
company
it
was
a
very
unpromising
case
at
last
the
time
came
when
poor
caddy
was
to
go
and
when
all
her
property
was
packed
on
the
hired
coach
and
pair
that
was
to
take
her
and
her
husband
to
gravesend
it
affected
us
to
see
caddy
clinging
then
to
her
deplorable
home
and
hanging
on
her
mother
neck
with
the
greatest
tenderness
i
am
very
sorry
i
could
go
on
writing
from
dictation
ma
sobbed
caddy
i
hope
you
forgive
me
now
oh
caddy
caddy
said
jellyby
i
have
told
you
over
and
over
again
that
i
have
engaged
a
boy
and
there
an
end
of
it
you
are
sure
you
are
not
the
least
angry
with
me
ma
say
you
are
sure
before
i
go
away
ma
you
foolish
caddy
returned
jellyby
do
i
look
angry
or
have
i
inclination
to
be
angry
or
time
to
be
angry
how
can
you
take
a
little
care
of
pa
while
i
am
gone
mama
jellyby
positively
laughed
at
the
fancy
you
romantic
child
said
she
lightly
patting
caddy
back
go
along
i
am
excellent
friends
with
you
now
caddy
and
be
very
happy
then
caddy
hung
upon
her
father
and
nursed
his
cheek
against
hers
as
if
he
were
some
poor
dull
child
in
pain
all
this
took
place
in
the
hall
her
father
released
her
took
out
his
pocket
handkerchief
and
sat
down
on
the
stairs
with
his
head
against
the
wall
i
hope
he
found
some
consolation
in
walls
i
almost
think
he
did
and
then
prince
took
her
arm
in
his
and
turned
with
great
emotion
and
respect
to
his
father
whose
deportment
at
that
moment
was
overwhelming
thank
you
over
and
over
again
father
said
prince
kissing
his
hand
i
am
very
grateful
for
all
your
kindness
and
consideration
regarding
our
marriage
and
so
i
can
assure
you
is
caddy
very
sobbed
caddy
my
dear
son
said
turveydrop
and
dear
daughter
i
have
done
my
duty
if
the
spirit
of
a
sainted
wooman
hovers
above
us
and
looks
down
on
the
occasion
that
and
your
constant
affection
will
be
my
recompense
you
will
not
fail
in
your
duty
my
son
and
daughter
i
believe
dear
father
never
cried
prince
never
never
dear
mr
turveydrop
said
caddy
this
returned
turveydrop
is
as
it
should
be
my
children
my
home
is
yours
my
heart
is
yours
my
all
is
yours
i
will
never
leave
you
nothing
but
death
shall
part
us
my
dear
son

contemplate
an
absence
of
a
week
i
think
a
week
dear
father
we
shall
return
home
this
day
week
my
dear
child
said
turveydrop
let
me
even
under
the
present
exceptional
circumstances
recommend
strict
punctuality
it
is
highly
important
to
keep
the
connexion
together
and
schools
if
at
all
neglected
are
apt
to
take
offence
this
day
week
father
we
shall
be
sure
to
be
home
to
dinner
good
said
turveydrop
you
will
find
fires
my
dear
caroline
in
your
own
room
and
dinner
prepared
in
my
apartment
yes
yes
prince
anticipating
some
objection
on
his
son
part
with
a
great
air
you
and
our
caroline
will
be
strange
in
the
upper
part
of
the
premises
and
will
therefore
dine
that
day
in
my
apartment
now
bless
ye
they
drove
away
and
whether
i
wondered
most
at
jellyby
or
at
turveydrop
i
did
not
know
ada
and
my
guardian
were
in
the
same
condition
when
we
came
to
talk
it
over
but
before
we
drove
away
too
i
received
a
most
unexpected
and
eloquent
compliment
from
jellyby
he
came
up
to
me
in
the
hall
took
both
my
hands
pressed
them
earnestly
and
opened
his
mouth
twice
i
was
so
sure
of
his
meaning
that
i
said
quite
flurried
you
are
very
welcome
sir
pray
do
mention
it
i
hope
this
marriage
is
for
the
best
guardian
said
i
when
we
three
were
on
our
road
home
i
hope
it
is
little
woman
patience
we
shall
see
is
the
wind
in
the
east
i
ventured
to
ask
him
he
laughed
heartily
and
answered
no
but
it
must
have
been
this
morning
i
think
said
i
he
answered
no
again
and
this
time
my
dear
girl
confidently
answered
no
too
and
shook
the
lovely
head
which
with
its
blooming
flowers
against
the
golden
hair
was
like
the
very
spring
much
you
know
of
east
winds
my
ugly
darling
said
i
kissing
her
in
my
admiration
i
could
help
it
well
it
was
only
their
love
for
me
i
know
very
well
and
it
is
a
long
time
ago
i
must
write
it
even
if
i
rub
it
out
again
because
it
gives
me
so
much
pleasure
they
said
there
could
be
no
east
wind
where
somebody
was
they
said
that
wherever
dame
durden
went
there
was
sunshine
and
summer
air
chapter
xxxi
nurse
and
patient
i
had
not
been
at
home
again
many
days
when
one
evening
i
went
upstairs
into
my
own
room
to
take
a
peep
over
charley
shoulder
and
see
how
she
was
getting
on
with
her
writing
was
a
trying
business
to
charley
who
seemed
to
have
no
natural
power
over
a
pen
but
in
whose
hand
every
pen
appeared
to
become
perversely
animated
and
to
go
wrong
and
crooked
and
to
stop
and
splash
and
sidle
into
corners
like
a
it
was
very
odd
to
see
what
old
letters
charley
young
hand
had
made
they
so
wrinkled
and
shrivelled
and
tottering
it
so
plump
and
round
yet
charley
was
uncommonly
expert
at
other
things
and
had
as
nimble
little
fingers
as
i
ever
watched
well
charley
said
i
looking
over
a
copy
of
the
letter
o
in
which
it
was
represented
as
square
triangular
and
collapsed
in
all
kinds
of
ways
we
are
improving
if
we
only
get
to
make
it
round
we
shall
be
perfect
charley
then
i
made
one
and
charley
made
one
and
the
pen
would
join
charley
neatly
but
twisted
it
up
into
a
knot
never
mind
charley
we
shall
do
it
in
time
charley
laid
down
her
pen
the
copy
being
finished
opened
and
shut
her
cramped
little
hand
looked
gravely
at
the
page
half
in
pride
and
half
in
doubt
and
got
up
and
dropped
me
a
curtsy
thank
you
miss
if
you
please
miss
did
you
know
a
poor
person
of
the
name
of
jenny
a
brickmaker
wife
charley
yes
she
came
and
spoke
to
me
when
i
was
out
a
little
while
ago
and
said
you
knew
her
miss
she
asked
me
if
i
was
the
young
lady
little
maid
meaning
you
for
the
young
lady
miss
and
i
said
yes
miss
i
thought
she
had
left
this
neighbourhood
altogether
charley
so
she
had
miss
but
she
come
back
again
to
where
she
used
to
live
she
and
liz
did
you
know
another
poor
person
of
the
name
of
liz
miss
i
think
i
do
charley
though
not
by
name
that
what
she
said
returned
charley
they
have
both
come
back
miss
and
have
been
tramping
high
and
low
tramping
high
and
low
have
they
charley
yes
miss
if
charley
could
only
have
made
the
letters
in
her
copy
as
round
as
the
eyes
with
which
she
looked
into
my
face
they
would
have
been
excellent
and
this
poor
person
came
about
the
house
three
or
four
days
hoping
to
get
a
glimpse
of
you
miss
all
she
wanted
she
said
but
you
were
away
that
was
when
she
saw
me
she
saw
me
about
miss
said
charley
with
a
short
laugh
of
the
greatest
delight
and
pride
and
she
thought
i
looked
like
your
maid
did
she
though
really
charley
yes
miss
said
charley
really
and
truly
and
charley
with
another
short
laugh
of
the
purest
glee
made
her
eyes
very
round
again
and
looked
as
serious
as
became
my
maid
i
was
never
tired
of
seeing
charley
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
that
great
dignity
standing
before
me
with
her
youthful
face
and
figure
and
her
steady
manner
and
her
childish
exultation
breaking
through
it
now
and
then
in
the
pleasantest
way
and
where
did
you
see
her
charley
said
i
my
little
maid
countenance
fell
as
she
replied
by
the
shop
miss
for
charley
wore
her
black
frock
yet
i
asked
if
the
brickmaker
wife
were
ill
but
charley
said
no
it
was
some
one
else
some
one
in
her
cottage
who
had
tramped
down
to
saint
albans
and
was
tramping
he
did
know
where
a
poor
boy
charley
said
no
father
no
mother
no
any
one
like
as
tom
might
have
been
miss
if
emma
and
me
had
died
after
father
said
charley
her
round
eyes
filling
with
tears
and
she
was
getting
medicine
for
him
charley
she
said
miss
returned
charley
how
that
he
had
once
done
as
much
for
her
my
little
maid
face
was
so
eager
and
her
quiet
hands
were
folded
so
closely
in
one
another
as
she
stood
looking
at
me
that
i
had
no
great
difficulty
in
reading
her
thoughts
well
charley
said
i
it
appears
to
me
that
you
and
i
can
do
no
better
than
go
round
to
jenny
and
see
what
the
matter
the
alacrity
with
which
charley
brought
my
bonnet
and
veil
and
having
dressed
me
quaintly
pinned
herself
into
her
warm
shawl
and
made
herself
look
like
a
little
old
woman
sufficiently
expressed
her
readiness
so
charley
and
i
without
saying
anything
to
any
one
went
out
it
was
a
cold
wild
night
and
the
trees
shuddered
in
the
wind
the
rain
had
been
thick
and
heavy
all
day
and
with
little
intermission
for
many
days
none
was
falling
just
then
however
the
sky
had
partly
cleared
but
was
very
gloomy
even
above
us
where
a
few
stars
were
shining
in
the
north
and
where
the
sun
had
set
three
hours
before
there
was
a
pale
dead
light
both
beautiful
and
awful
and
into
it
long
sullen
lines
of
cloud
waved
up
like
a
sea
stricken
immovable
as
it
was
heaving
towards
london
a
lurid
glare
overhung
the
whole
dark
waste
and
the
contrast
between
these
two
lights
and
the
fancy
which
the
redder
light
engendered
of
an
unearthly
fire
gleaming
on
all
the
unseen
buildings
of
the
city
and
on
all
the
faces
of
its
many
thousands
of
wondering
inhabitants
was
as
solemn
as
might
be
i
had
no
thought
that
night
none
i
am
quite
sure
of
what
was
soon
to
happen
to
me
but
i
have
always
remembered
since
that
when
we
had
stopped
at
the
to
look
up
at
the
sky
and
when
we
went
upon
our
way
i
had
for
a
moment
an
undefinable
impression
of
myself
as
being
something
different
from
what
i
then
was
i
know
it
was
then
and
there
that
i
had
it
i
have
ever
since
connected
the
feeling
with
that
spot
and
time
and
with
everything
associated
with
that
spot
and
time
to
the
distant
voices
in
the
town
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
the
sound
of
wheels
coming
down
the
miry
hill
it
was
saturday
night
and
most
of
the
people
belonging
to
the
place
where
we
were
going
were
drinking
elsewhere
we
found
it
quieter
than
i
had
previously
seen
it
though
quite
as
miserable
the
kilns
were
burning
and
a
stifling
vapour
set
towards
us
with
a
glare
we
came
to
the
cottage
where
there
was
a
feeble
candle
in
the
patched
window
we
tapped
at
the
door
and
went
in
the
mother
of
the
little
child
who
had
died
was
sitting
in
a
chair
on
one
side
of
the
poor
fire
by
the
bed
and
opposite
to
her
a
wretched
boy
supported
by
the
was
cowering
on
the
floor
he
held
under
his
arm
like
a
little
bundle
a
fragment
of
a
fur
cap
and
as
he
tried
to
warm
himself
he
shook
until
the
crazy
door
and
window
shook
the
place
was
closer
than
before
and
had
an
unhealthy
and
a
very
peculiar
smell
i
had
not
lifted
my
veil
when
i
first
spoke
to
the
woman
which
was
at
the
moment
of
our
going
in
the
boy
staggered
up
instantly
and
stared
at
me
with
a
remarkable
expression
of
surprise
and
terror
his
action
was
so
quick
and
my
being
the
cause
of
it
was
so
evident
that
i
stood
still
instead
of
advancing
nearer
i
wo
go
no
more
to
the
berryin
ground
muttered
the
boy
i
ai
there
so
i
tell
you
i
lifted
my
veil
and
spoke
to
the
woman
she
said
to
me
in
a
low
voice
do
mind
him
he
soon
come
back
to
his
head
and
said
to
him
jo
jo
what
the
matter
i
know
wot
she
come
for
cried
the
boy
who
the
lady
there
she
come
to
get
me
to
go
along
with
her
to
the
berryin
ground
i
wo
go
to
the
berryin
ground
i
do
like
the
name
on
it
she
might
go
me
his
shivering
came
on
again
and
as
he
leaned
against
the
wall
he
shook
the
hovel
he
has
been
talking
off
and
on
about
such
like
all
day
said
jenny
softly
why
how
you
stare
this
is
my
lady
jo
is
it
returned
the
boy
doubtfully
and
surveying
me
with
his
arm
held
out
above
his
burning
eyes
she
looks
to
me
the
one
it
ai
the
bonnet
nor
yet
it
ai
the
gownd
but
she
looks
to
me
the
one
my
little
charley
with
her
premature
experience
of
illness
and
trouble
had
pulled
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
now
went
quietly
up
to
him
with
a
chair
and
sat
him
down
in
it
like
an
old
sick
nurse
except
that
no
such
attendant
could
have
shown
him
charley
youthful
face
which
seemed
to
engage
his
confidence
i
say
said
the
boy
you
tell
me
ai
the
lady
the
lady
charley
shook
her
head
as
she
methodically
drew
his
rags
about
him
and
made
him
as
warm
as
she
could
oh
the
boy
muttered
then
i
she
ai
i
came
to
see
if
i
could
do
you
any
good
said
i
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
froze
returned
the
boy
hoarsely
with
his
haggard
gaze
wandering
about
me
and
then
burnt
up
and
then
froze
and
then
burnt
up
ever
so
many
times
in
a
hour
and
my
head
all
sleepy
and
all
and
i
so
dry
and
my
bones
is
half
so
much
bones
as
pain
when
did
he
come
here
i
asked
the
woman
this
morning
i
found
him
at
the
corner
of
the
town
i
had
known
him
up
in
london
yonder
had
i
jo
the
boy
replied
whenever
he
fixed
his
attention
or
his
eyes
it
was
only
for
a
very
little
while
he
soon
began
to
droop
his
head
again
and
roll
it
heavily
and
speak
as
if
he
were
half
awake
when
did
he
come
from
london
i
asked
i
come
from
london
said
the
boy
himself
now
flushed
and
hot
i
somewheres
where
is
he
going
i
asked
somewheres
repeated
the
boy
in
a
louder
tone
i
have
been
moved
on
and
moved
on
more
nor
ever
i
was
afore
since
the
one
give
me
the
snagsby
she
always
and
of
me
what
have
i
done
to
her
and
they
all
and
of
me
every
one
of
doing
of
it
from
the
time
when
i
do
get
up
to
the
time
when
i
do
go
to
bed
and
somewheres
that
where
i
she
told
me
down
in
as
she
came
from
stolbuns
and
so
i
took
the
stolbuns
road
it
as
good
as
another
he
always
concluded
by
addressing
charley
what
is
to
be
done
with
him
said
i
taking
the
woman
aside
he
could
not
travel
in
this
state
even
if
he
had
a
purpose
and
knew
where
he
was
going
i
know
no
more
than
the
dead
she
replied
glancing
compassionately
at
him
perhaps
the
dead
know
better
if
they
could
only
tell
us
i
kept
him
here
all
day
for
pity
sake
and
given
him
broth
and
physic
and
liz
has
gone
to
try
if
any
one
will
take
him
in
here
my
pretty
in
the
bed
her
child
but
i
call
it
mine
but
i
ca
keep
him
long
for
if
my
husband
was
to
come
home
and
find
him
here
he
be
rough
in
putting
him
out
and
might
do
him
a
hurt
hark
here
comes
liz
back
the
other
woman
came
hurriedly
in
as
she
spoke
and
the
boy
got
up
with
a
sense
that
he
was
expected
to
be
going
when
the
little
child
awoke
and
when
and
how
charley
got
at
it
took
it
out
of
bed
and
began
to
walk
about
hushing
it
i
do
know
there
she
was
doing
all
this
in
a
quiet
motherly
manner
as
if
she
were
living
in
blinder
attic
with
tom
and
emma
again
the
friend
had
been
here
and
there
and
had
been
played
about
from
hand
to
hand
and
had
come
back
as
she
went
at
first
it
was
too
early
for
the
boy
to
be
received
into
the
proper
refuge
and
at
last
it
was
too
late
one
official
sent
her
to
another
and
the
other
sent
her
back
again
to
the
first
and
so
backward
and
forward
until
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
both
must
have
been
appointed
for
their
skill
in
evading
their
duties
instead
of
performing
them
and
now
after
all
she
said
breathing
quickly
for
she
had
been
running
and
was
frightened
too
jenny
your
master
on
the
road
home
and
not
far
behind
and
the
lord
help
the
boy
for
we
can
do
no
more
for
him
they
put
a
few
halfpence
together
and
hurried
them
into
his
hand
and
so
in
an
oblivious
way
he
shuffled
out
of
the
house
give
me
the
child
my
dear
said
its
mother
to
charley
and
thank
you
kindly
too
jenny
woman
dear
good
night
young
lady
if
my
master
do
fall
out
with
me
i
look
down
by
the
kiln
by
and
by
where
the
boy
will
be
most
like
and
again
in
the
morning
she
hurried
off
and
presently
we
passed
her
hushing
and
singing
to
her
child
at
her
own
door
and
looking
anxiously
along
the
road
for
her
drunken
husband
i
was
afraid
of
staying
then
to
speak
to
either
woman
lest
i
should
bring
her
into
trouble
but
i
said
to
charley
that
we
must
not
leave
the
boy
to
die
charley
who
knew
what
to
do
much
better
than
i
did
and
whose
quickness
equalled
her
presence
of
mind
glided
on
before
me
and
presently
we
came
up
with
jo
just
short
of
the
i
think
he
must
have
begun
his
journey
with
some
small
bundle
under
his
arm
and
must
have
had
it
stolen
or
lost
it
for
he
still
carried
his
wretched
fragment
of
fur
cap
like
a
bundle
though
he
went
through
the
rain
which
now
fell
fast
he
stopped
when
we
called
to
him
and
again
showed
a
dread
of
me
when
i
came
up
standing
with
his
lustrous
eyes
fixed
upon
me
and
even
arrested
in
his
shivering
fit
i
asked
him
to
come
with
us
and
we
would
take
care
that
he
had
some
shelter
for
the
night
i
do
want
no
shelter
he
said
i
can
lay
amongst
the
warm
bricks
but
do
you
know
that
people
die
there
replied
charley
they
dies
everywheres
said
the
boy
they
dies
in
their
lodgings
she
knows
where
i
showed
her
and
they
dies
down
in
in
heaps
they
dies
more
than
they
lives
according
to
what
i
see
then
he
hoarsely
whispered
charley
if
she
ai
the
one
she
ai
the
forrenner
is
there
three
of
then
charley
looked
at
me
a
little
frightened
i
felt
half
frightened
at
myself
when
the
boy
glared
on
me
so
but
he
turned
and
followed
when
i
beckoned
to
him
and
finding
that
he
acknowledged
that
influence
in
me
i
led
the
way
straight
home
it
was
not
far
only
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
we
passed
but
one
man
i
doubted
if
we
should
have
got
home
without
assistance
the
steps
were
so
uncertain
and
tremulous
he
made
no
complaint
however
and
was
strangely
unconcerned
about
himself
if
i
may
say
so
strange
a
thing
leaving
him
in
the
hall
for
a
moment
shrunk
into
the
corner
of
the
and
staring
with
an
indifference
that
scarcely
could
be
called
wonder
at
the
comfort
and
brightness
about
him
i
went
into
the
to
speak
to
my
guardian
there
i
found
skimpole
who
had
come
down
by
the
coach
as
he
frequently
did
without
notice
and
never
bringing
any
clothes
with
him
but
always
borrowing
everything
he
wanted
they
came
out
with
me
directly
to
look
at
the
boy
the
servants
had
gathered
in
the
hall
too
and
he
shivered
in
the
with
charley
standing
by
him
like
some
wounded
animal
that
had
been
found
in
a
ditch
this
is
a
sorrowful
case
said
my
guardian
after
asking
him
a
question
or
two
and
touching
him
and
examining
his
eyes
what
do
you
say
harold
you
had
better
turn
him
out
said
skimpole
what
do
you
mean
inquired
my
guardian
almost
sternly
my
dear
jarndyce
said
skimpole
you
know
what
i
am
i
am
a
child
be
cross
to
me
if
i
deserve
it
but
i
have
a
constitutional
objection
to
this
sort
of
thing
i
always
had
when
i
was
a
medical
man
he
not
safe
you
know
there
a
very
bad
sort
of
fever
about
him
skimpole
had
retreated
from
the
hall
to
the
again
and
said
this
in
his
airy
way
seated
on
the
as
we
stood
by
you
say
it
childish
observed
skimpole
looking
gaily
at
us
well
i
dare
say
it
may
be
but
i
am
a
child
and
i
never
pretend
to
be
anything
else
if
you
put
him
out
in
the
road
you
only
put
him
where
he
was
before
he
will
be
no
worse
off
than
he
was
you
know
even
make
him
better
off
if
you
like
give
him
sixpence
or
five
shillings
or
five
pound
ten
you
are
arithmeticians
and
i
am
not
and
get
rid
of
him
and
what
is
he
to
do
then
asked
my
guardian
upon
my
life
said
skimpole
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
his
engaging
smile
i
have
not
the
least
idea
what
he
is
to
do
then
but
i
have
no
doubt
he
do
it
now
is
it
not
a
horrible
reflection
said
my
guardian
to
whom
i
had
hastily
explained
the
unavailing
efforts
of
the
two
women
is
it
not
a
horrible
reflection
walking
up
and
down
and
rumpling
his
hair
that
if
this
wretched
creature
were
a
convicted
prisoner
his
hospital
would
be
wide
open
to
him
and
he
would
be
as
well
taken
care
of
as
any
sick
boy
in
the
kingdom
my
dear
jarndyce
returned
skimpole
you
pardon
the
simplicity
of
the
question
coming
as
it
does
from
a
creature
who
is
perfectly
simple
in
worldly
matters
but
why
is
he
a
prisoner
then
my
guardian
stopped
and
looked
at
him
with
a
whimsical
mixture
of
amusement
and
indignation
in
his
face
our
young
friend
is
not
to
be
suspected
of
any
delicacy
i
should
imagine
said
skimpole
unabashed
and
candid
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
wiser
as
well
as
in
a
certain
kind
of
way
more
respectable
if
he
showed
some
misdirected
energy
that
got
him
into
prison
there
would
be
more
of
an
adventurous
spirit
in
it
and
consequently
more
of
a
certain
sort
of
poetry
i
believe
returned
my
guardian
resuming
his
uneasy
walk
that
there
is
not
such
another
child
on
earth
as
yourself
do
you
really
said
skimpole
i
dare
say
but
i
confess
i
do
see
why
our
young
friend
in
his
degree
should
not
seek
to
invest
himself
with
such
poetry
as
is
open
to
him
he
is
no
doubt
born
with
an
appetite
probably
when
he
is
in
a
safer
state
of
health
he
has
an
excellent
appetite
very
well
at
our
young
friend
natural
dinner
hour
most
likely
about
noon
our
young
friend
says
in
effect
to
society
am
hungry
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
produce
your
spoon
and
feed
me
society
which
has
taken
upon
itself
the
general
arrangement
of
the
whole
system
of
spoons
and
professes
to
have
a
spoon
for
our
young
friend
does
not
produce
that
spoon
and
our
young
friend
therefore
says
really
must
excuse
me
if
i
seize
it
now
this
appears
to
me
a
case
of
misdirected
energy
which
has
a
certain
amount
of
reason
in
it
and
a
certain
amount
of
romance
and
i
do
know
but
what
i
should
be
more
interested
in
our
young
friend
as
an
illustration
of
such
a
case
than
merely
as
a
poor
vagabond
which
any
one
can
be
in
the
meantime
i
ventured
to
observe
he
is
getting
worse
in
the
meantime
said
skimpole
cheerfully
as
miss
summerson
with
her
practical
good
sense
observes
he
is
getting
worse
therefore
i
recommend
your
turning
him
out
before
he
gets
still
worse
the
amiable
face
with
which
he
said
it
i
think
i
shall
never
forget
of
course
little
woman
observed
my
guardian
turning
to
me
i
can
ensure
his
admission
into
the
proper
place
by
merely
going
there
to
enforce
it
though
it
a
bad
state
of
things
when
in
his
condition
that
is
necessary
but
it
growing
late
and
is
a
very
bad
night
and
the
boy
is
worn
out
already
there
is
a
bed
in
the
wholesome
by
the
stable
we
had
better
keep
him
there
till
morning
when
he
can
be
wrapped
up
and
removed
we
do
that
oh
said
skimpole
with
his
hands
upon
the
keys
of
the
piano
as
we
moved
away
are
you
going
back
to
our
young
friend
yes
said
my
guardian
how
i
envy
you
your
constitution
jarndyce
returned
skimpole
with
playful
admiration
you
do
mind
these
things
neither
does
miss
summerson
you
are
ready
at
all
times
to
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
such
is
will
i
have
no
will
at
all
and
no
wo
simply
ca
you
ca
recommend
anything
for
the
boy
i
suppose
said
my
guardian
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
half
angrily
only
half
angrily
for
he
never
seemed
to
consider
skimpole
an
accountable
being
my
dear
jarndyce
i
observed
a
bottle
of
cooling
medicine
in
his
pocket
and
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
better
than
take
it
you
can
tell
them
to
sprinkle
a
little
vinegar
about
the
place
where
he
sleeps
and
to
keep
it
moderately
cool
and
him
moderately
warm
but
it
is
mere
impertinence
in
me
to
offer
any
recommendation
miss
summerson
has
such
a
knowledge
of
detail
and
such
a
capacity
for
the
administration
of
detail
that
she
knows
all
about
it
we
went
back
into
the
hall
and
explained
to
jo
what
we
proposed
to
do
which
charley
explained
to
him
again
and
which
he
received
with
the
languid
unconcern
i
had
already
noticed
wearily
looking
on
at
what
was
done
as
if
it
were
for
somebody
else
the
servants
compassionating
his
miserable
state
and
being
very
anxious
to
help
we
soon
got
the
ready
and
some
of
the
men
about
the
house
carried
him
across
the
wet
yard
well
wrapped
up
it
was
pleasant
to
observe
how
kind
they
were
to
him
and
how
there
appeared
to
be
a
general
impression
among
them
that
frequently
calling
him
old
chap
was
likely
to
revive
his
spirits
charley
directed
the
operations
and
went
to
and
fro
between
the
and
the
house
with
such
little
stimulants
and
comforts
as
we
thought
it
safe
to
give
him
my
guardian
himself
saw
him
before
he
was
left
for
the
night
and
reported
to
me
when
he
returned
to
the
growlery
to
write
a
letter
on
the
boy
behalf
which
a
messenger
was
charged
to
deliver
at
in
the
morning
that
he
seemed
easier
and
inclined
to
sleep
they
had
fastened
his
door
on
the
outside
he
said
in
case
of
his
being
delirious
but
had
so
arranged
that
he
could
not
make
any
noise
without
being
heard
ada
being
in
our
room
with
a
cold
skimpole
was
left
alone
all
this
time
and
entertained
himself
by
playing
snatches
of
pathetic
airs
and
sometimes
singing
to
them
as
we
heard
at
a
distance
with
great
expression
and
feeling
when
we
rejoined
him
in
the
he
said
he
would
give
us
a
little
ballad
which
had
come
into
his
head
apropos
of
our
young
friend
and
he
sang
one
about
a
peasant
boy
thrown
on
the
wide
world
doomed
to
wander
and
roam
bereft
of
his
parents
bereft
of
a
home
quite
exquisitely
it
was
a
song
that
always
made
him
cry
he
told
us
he
was
extremely
gay
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
for
he
absolutely
chirped
those
were
his
delighted
words
when
he
thought
by
what
a
happy
talent
for
business
he
was
surrounded
he
gave
us
in
his
glass
of
negus
better
health
to
our
young
friend
and
supposed
and
gaily
pursued
the
case
of
his
being
reserved
like
whittington
to
become
lord
mayor
of
london
in
that
event
no
doubt
he
would
establish
the
jarndyce
institution
and
the
summerson
almshouses
and
a
little
annual
corporation
pilgrimage
to
albans
he
had
no
doubt
he
said
that
our
young
friend
was
an
excellent
boy
in
his
way
but
his
way
was
not
the
harold
skimpole
way
what
harold
skimpole
was
harold
skimpole
had
found
himself
to
his
considerable
surprise
when
he
first
made
his
own
acquaintance
he
had
accepted
himself
with
all
his
failings
and
had
thought
it
sound
philosophy
to
make
the
best
of
the
bargain
and
he
hoped
we
would
do
the
same
charley
last
report
was
that
the
boy
was
quiet
i
could
see
from
my
window
the
lantern
they
had
left
him
burning
quietly
and
i
went
to
bed
very
happy
to
think
that
he
was
sheltered
there
was
more
movement
and
more
talking
than
usual
a
little
before
daybreak
and
it
awoke
me
as
i
was
dressing
i
looked
out
of
my
window
and
asked
one
of
our
men
who
had
been
among
the
active
sympathizers
last
night
whether
there
was
anything
wrong
about
the
house
the
lantern
was
still
burning
in
the
it
the
boy
miss
said
he
is
he
worse
i
inquired
gone
miss
dead
dead
miss
no
gone
clean
off
at
what
time
of
the
night
he
had
gone
or
how
or
why
it
seemed
hopeless
ever
to
divine
the
door
remaining
as
it
had
been
left
and
the
lantern
standing
in
the
window
it
could
only
be
supposed
that
he
had
got
out
by
a
trap
in
the
floor
which
communicated
with
an
empty
below
but
he
had
shut
it
down
again
if
that
were
so
and
it
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
raised
nothing
of
any
kind
was
missing
on
this
fact
being
clearly
ascertained
we
all
yielded
to
the
painful
belief
that
delirium
had
come
upon
him
in
the
night
and
that
allured
by
some
imaginary
object
or
pursued
by
some
imaginary
horror
he
had
strayed
away
in
that
worse
than
helpless
state
all
of
us
that
is
to
say
but
skimpole
who
repeatedly
suggested
in
his
usual
easy
light
style
that
it
had
occurred
to
our
young
friend
that
he
was
not
a
safe
inmate
having
a
bad
kind
of
fever
upon
him
and
that
he
had
with
great
natural
politeness
taken
himself
off
every
possible
inquiry
was
made
and
every
place
was
searched
the
were
examined
the
cottages
were
visited
the
two
women
were
particularly
questioned
but
they
knew
nothing
of
him
and
nobody
could
doubt
that
their
wonder
was
genuine
the
weather
had
for
some
time
been
too
wet
and
the
night
itself
had
been
too
wet
to
admit
of
any
tracing
by
footsteps
hedge
and
ditch
and
wall
and
rick
and
stack
were
examined
by
our
men
for
a
long
distance
round
lest
the
boy
should
be
lying
in
such
a
place
insensible
or
dead
but
nothing
was
seen
to
indicate
that
he
had
ever
been
near
from
the
time
when
he
was
left
in
the
he
vanished
the
search
continued
for
five
days
i
do
not
mean
that
it
ceased
even
then
but
that
my
attention
was
then
diverted
into
a
current
very
memorable
to
me
as
charley
was
at
her
writing
again
in
my
room
in
the
evening
and
as
i
sat
opposite
to
her
at
work
i
felt
the
table
tremble
looking
up
i
saw
my
little
maid
shivering
from
head
to
foot
charley
said
i
are
you
so
cold
i
think
i
am
miss
she
replied
i
do
know
what
it
is
i
hold
myself
still
i
felt
so
yesterday
at
about
this
same
time
miss
do
be
uneasy
i
think
i
i
heard
ada
voice
outside
and
i
hurried
to
the
door
of
communication
between
my
room
and
our
pretty
and
locked
it
just
in
time
for
she
tapped
at
it
while
my
hand
was
yet
upon
the
key
ada
called
to
me
to
let
her
in
but
i
said
not
now
my
dearest
go
away
there
nothing
the
matter
i
will
come
to
you
presently
ah
it
was
a
long
long
time
before
my
darling
girl
and
i
were
companions
again
charley
fell
ill
in
twelve
hours
she
was
very
ill
i
moved
her
to
my
room
and
laid
her
in
my
bed
and
sat
down
quietly
to
nurse
her
i
told
my
guardian
all
about
it
and
why
i
felt
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
seclude
myself
and
my
reason
for
not
seeing
my
darling
above
all
at
first
she
came
very
often
to
the
door
and
called
to
me
and
even
reproached
me
with
sobs
and
tears
but
i
wrote
her
a
long
letter
saying
that
she
made
me
anxious
and
unhappy
and
imploring
her
as
she
loved
me
and
wished
my
mind
to
be
at
peace
to
come
no
nearer
than
the
garden
after
that
she
came
beneath
the
window
even
oftener
than
she
had
come
to
the
door
and
if
i
had
learnt
to
love
her
dear
sweet
voice
before
when
we
were
hardly
ever
apart
how
did
i
learn
to
love
it
then
when
i
stood
behind
the
listening
and
replying
but
not
so
much
as
looking
out
how
did
i
learn
to
love
it
afterwards
when
the
harder
time
came
they
put
a
bed
for
me
in
our
and
by
keeping
the
door
wide
open
i
turned
the
two
rooms
into
one
now
that
ada
had
vacated
that
part
of
the
house
and
kept
them
always
fresh
and
airy
there
was
not
a
servant
in
or
about
the
house
but
was
so
good
that
they
would
all
most
gladly
have
come
to
me
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
without
the
least
fear
or
unwillingness
but
i
thought
it
best
to
choose
one
worthy
woman
who
was
never
to
see
ada
and
whom
i
could
trust
to
come
and
go
with
all
precaution
through
her
means
i
got
out
to
take
the
air
with
my
guardian
when
there
was
no
fear
of
meeting
ada
and
wanted
for
nothing
in
the
way
of
attendance
any
more
than
in
any
other
respect
and
thus
poor
charley
sickened
and
grew
worse
and
fell
into
heavy
danger
of
death
and
lay
severely
ill
for
many
a
long
round
of
day
and
night
so
patient
she
was
so
uncomplaining
and
inspired
by
such
a
gentle
fortitude
that
very
often
as
i
sat
by
charley
holding
her
head
in
my
arms
repose
would
come
to
her
so
when
it
would
come
to
her
in
no
other
attitude
i
silently
prayed
to
our
father
in
heaven
that
i
might
not
forget
the
lesson
which
this
little
sister
taught
me
i
was
very
sorrowful
to
think
that
charley
pretty
looks
would
change
and
be
disfigured
even
if
she
recovered
she
was
such
a
child
with
her
dimpled
face
but
that
thought
was
for
the
greater
part
lost
in
her
greater
peril
when
she
was
at
the
worst
and
her
mind
rambled
again
to
the
cares
of
her
father
sick
bed
and
the
little
children
she
still
knew
me
so
far
as
that
she
would
be
quiet
in
my
arms
when
she
could
lie
quiet
nowhere
else
and
murmur
out
the
wanderings
of
her
mind
less
restlessly
at
those
times
i
used
to
think
how
should
i
ever
tell
the
two
remaining
babies
that
the
baby
who
had
learned
of
her
faithful
heart
to
be
a
mother
to
them
in
their
need
was
dead
there
were
other
times
when
charley
knew
me
well
and
talked
to
me
telling
me
that
she
sent
her
love
to
tom
and
emma
and
that
she
was
sure
tom
would
grow
up
to
be
a
good
man
at
those
times
charley
would
speak
to
me
of
what
she
had
read
to
her
father
as
well
as
she
could
to
comfort
him
of
that
young
man
carried
out
to
be
buried
who
was
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
was
a
widow
of
the
daughter
raised
up
by
the
gracious
hand
upon
her
bed
of
death
and
charley
told
me
that
when
her
father
died
she
had
kneeled
down
and
prayed
in
her
first
sorrow
that
he
likewise
might
be
raised
up
and
given
back
to
his
poor
children
and
that
if
she
should
never
get
better
and
should
die
too
she
thought
it
likely
that
it
might
come
into
tom
mind
to
offer
the
same
prayer
for
her
then
would
i
show
tom
how
these
people
of
old
days
had
been
brought
back
to
life
on
earth
only
that
we
might
know
our
hope
to
be
restored
to
heaven
but
of
all
the
various
times
there
were
in
charley
illness
there
was
not
one
when
she
lost
the
gentle
qualities
i
have
spoken
of
and
there
were
many
many
when
i
thought
in
the
night
of
the
last
high
belief
in
the
watching
angel
and
the
last
higher
trust
in
god
on
the
part
of
her
poor
despised
father
and
charley
did
not
die
she
flutteringly
and
slowly
turned
the
dangerous
point
after
long
lingering
there
and
then
began
to
mend
the
hope
that
never
had
been
given
from
the
first
of
charley
being
in
outward
appearance
charley
any
more
soon
began
to
be
encouraged
and
even
that
prospered
and
i
saw
her
growing
into
her
old
childish
likeness
again
it
was
a
great
morning
when
i
could
tell
ada
all
this
as
she
stood
out
in
the
garden
and
it
was
a
great
evening
when
charley
and
i
at
last
took
tea
together
in
the
next
room
but
on
that
same
evening
i
felt
that
i
was
stricken
cold
happily
for
both
of
us
it
was
not
until
charley
was
safe
in
bed
again
and
placidly
asleep
that
i
began
to
think
the
contagion
of
her
illness
was
upon
me
i
had
been
able
easily
to
hide
what
i
felt
at
but
i
was
past
that
already
now
and
i
knew
that
i
was
rapidly
following
in
charley
steps
i
was
well
enough
however
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
and
to
return
my
darling
cheerful
blessing
from
the
garden
and
to
talk
with
her
as
long
as
usual
but
i
was
not
free
from
an
impression
that
i
had
been
walking
about
the
two
rooms
in
the
night
a
little
beside
myself
though
knowing
where
i
was
and
i
felt
confused
at
times
with
a
curious
sense
of
fullness
as
if
i
were
becoming
too
large
altogether
in
the
evening
i
was
so
much
worse
that
i
resolved
to
prepare
charley
with
which
view
i
said
you
getting
quite
strong
charley
are
you
not
oh
quite
said
charley
strong
enough
to
be
told
a
secret
i
think
charley
quite
strong
enough
for
that
miss
cried
charley
but
face
fell
in
the
height
of
her
delight
for
she
saw
the
secret
in
my
face
and
she
came
out
of
the
great
chair
and
fell
upon
my
bosom
and
said
oh
miss
it
my
doing
it
my
doing
and
a
great
deal
more
out
of
the
fullness
of
her
grateful
heart
now
charley
said
i
after
letting
her
go
on
for
a
little
while
if
i
am
to
be
ill
my
great
trust
humanly
speaking
is
in
you
and
unless
you
are
as
quiet
and
composed
for
me
as
you
always
were
for
yourself
you
can
never
fulfil
it
charley
if
you
let
me
cry
a
little
longer
miss
said
charley
oh
my
dear
my
dear
if
you
only
let
me
cry
a
little
longer
oh
my
dear
how
affectionately
and
devotedly
she
poured
this
out
as
she
clung
to
my
neck
i
never
can
remember
without
tears
i
be
good
so
i
let
charley
cry
a
little
longer
and
it
did
us
both
good
trust
in
me
now
if
you
please
miss
said
charley
quietly
i
am
listening
to
everything
you
say
it
very
little
at
present
charley
i
shall
tell
your
doctor
that
i
do
think
i
am
well
and
that
you
are
going
to
nurse
me
for
that
the
poor
child
thanked
me
with
her
whole
heart
and
in
the
morning
when
you
hear
miss
ada
in
the
garden
if
i
should
not
be
quite
able
to
go
to
the
as
usual
do
you
go
charley
and
say
i
am
asleep
that
i
have
rather
tired
myself
and
am
asleep
at
all
times
keep
the
room
as
i
have
kept
it
charley
and
let
no
one
come
charley
promised
and
i
lay
down
for
i
was
very
heavy
i
saw
the
doctor
that
night
and
asked
the
favour
of
him
that
i
wished
to
ask
relative
to
his
saying
nothing
of
my
illness
in
the
house
as
yet
i
have
a
very
indistinct
remembrance
of
that
night
melting
into
day
and
of
day
melting
into
night
again
but
i
was
just
able
on
the
first
morning
to
get
to
the
window
and
speak
to
my
darling
on
the
second
morning
i
heard
her
dear
voice
oh
how
dear
now
outside
and
i
asked
charley
with
some
difficulty
speech
being
painful
to
me
to
go
and
say
i
was
asleep
i
heard
her
answer
softly
do
disturb
her
charley
for
the
world
how
does
my
own
pride
look
charley
i
inquired
disappointed
miss
said
charley
peeping
through
the
curtain
but
i
know
she
is
very
beautiful
this
morning
she
is
indeed
miss
answered
charley
peeping
still
looking
up
at
the
window
with
her
blue
clear
eyes
god
bless
them
always
loveliest
when
raised
like
that
i
called
charley
to
me
and
gave
her
her
last
charge
now
charley
when
she
knows
i
am
ill
she
will
try
to
make
her
way
into
the
room
keep
her
out
charley
if
you
love
me
truly
to
the
last
charley
if
you
let
her
in
but
once
only
to
look
upon
me
for
one
moment
as
i
lie
here
i
shall
die
i
never
will
i
never
will
she
promised
me
i
believe
it
my
dear
charley
and
now
come
and
sit
beside
me
for
a
little
while
and
touch
me
with
your
hand
for
i
can
not
see
you
charley
i
am
blind
chapter
xxxii
the
appointed
time
it
is
night
in
lincoln
inn
perplexed
and
troublous
valley
of
the
shadow
of
the
law
where
suitors
generally
find
but
little
day
and
fat
candles
are
snuffed
out
in
offices
and
clerks
have
rattled
down
the
crazy
wooden
stairs
and
dispersed
the
bell
that
rings
at
nine
has
ceased
its
doleful
clangour
about
nothing
the
gates
are
shut
and
the
a
solemn
warder
with
a
mighty
power
of
sleep
keeps
guard
in
his
lodge
from
tiers
of
staircase
windows
clogged
lamps
like
the
eyes
of
equity
bleared
argus
with
a
fathomless
pocket
for
every
eye
and
an
eye
upon
it
dimly
blink
at
the
stars
in
dirty
upper
casements
here
and
there
hazy
little
patches
of
candlelight
reveal
where
some
wise
draughtsman
and
conveyancer
yet
toils
for
the
entanglement
of
real
estate
in
meshes
of
in
the
average
ratio
of
about
a
dozen
of
sheep
to
an
acre
of
land
over
which
industry
these
benefactors
of
their
species
linger
yet
though
be
past
that
they
may
give
for
every
day
some
good
account
at
last
in
the
neighbouring
court
where
the
lord
chancellor
of
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
dwells
there
is
a
general
tendency
towards
beer
and
supper
piper
and
perkins
whose
respective
sons
engaged
with
a
circle
of
acquaintance
in
the
game
of
hide
and
seek
have
been
lying
in
ambush
about
the
of
chancery
lane
for
some
hours
and
scouring
the
plain
of
the
same
thoroughfare
to
the
confusion
of
passengers
piper
and
perkins
have
but
now
exchanged
congratulations
on
the
children
being
abed
and
they
still
linger
on
a
over
a
few
parting
words
krook
and
his
lodger
and
the
fact
of
krook
being
continually
in
liquor
and
the
testamentary
prospects
of
the
young
man
are
as
usual
the
staple
of
their
conversation
but
they
have
something
to
say
likewise
of
the
harmonic
meeting
at
the
sol
arms
where
the
sound
of
the
piano
through
the
partly
opened
windows
jingles
out
into
the
court
and
where
little
swills
after
keeping
the
lovers
of
harmony
in
a
roar
like
a
very
yorick
may
now
be
heard
taking
the
gruff
line
in
a
concerted
piece
and
sentimentally
adjuring
his
friends
and
patrons
to
listen
listen
listen
tew
the
fall
perkins
and
piper
compare
opinions
on
the
subject
of
the
young
lady
of
professional
celebrity
who
assists
at
the
harmonic
meetings
and
who
has
a
space
to
herself
in
the
manuscript
announcement
in
the
window
perkins
possessing
information
that
she
has
been
married
a
year
and
a
half
though
announced
as
miss
melvilleson
the
noted
siren
and
that
her
baby
is
clandestinely
conveyed
to
the
sol
arms
every
night
to
receive
its
natural
nourishment
during
the
entertainments
sooner
than
which
myself
says
perkins
i
would
get
my
living
by
selling
lucifers
piper
as
in
duty
bound
is
of
the
same
opinion
holding
that
a
private
station
is
better
than
public
applause
and
thanking
heaven
for
her
own
and
by
implication
perkins
respectability
by
this
time
the
of
the
sol
arms
appearing
with
her
well
frothed
piper
accepts
that
tankard
and
retires
indoors
first
giving
a
fair
good
night
to
perkins
who
has
had
her
own
pint
in
her
hand
ever
since
it
was
fetched
from
the
same
hostelry
by
young
perkins
before
he
was
sent
to
bed
now
there
is
a
sound
of
putting
up
in
the
court
and
a
smell
as
of
the
smoking
of
pipes
and
shooting
stars
are
seen
in
upper
windows
further
indicating
retirement
to
rest
now
too
the
policeman
begins
to
push
at
doors
to
try
fastenings
to
be
suspicious
of
bundles
and
to
administer
his
beat
on
the
hypothesis
that
every
one
is
either
robbing
or
being
robbed
it
is
a
close
night
though
the
damp
cold
is
searching
too
and
there
is
a
laggard
mist
a
little
way
up
in
the
air
it
is
a
fine
steaming
night
to
turn
the
the
unwholesome
trades
the
sewerage
bad
water
and
to
account
and
give
the
registrar
of
deaths
some
extra
business
it
may
be
something
in
the
air
there
is
plenty
in
it
or
it
may
be
something
in
himself
that
is
in
fault
but
weevle
otherwise
jobling
is
very
ill
at
ease
he
comes
and
goes
between
his
own
room
and
the
open
street
door
twenty
times
an
hour
he
has
been
doing
so
ever
since
it
fell
dark
since
the
chancellor
shut
up
his
shop
which
he
did
very
early
weevle
has
been
down
and
up
and
down
and
up
with
a
cheap
tight
velvet
on
his
head
making
his
whiskers
look
out
of
all
proportion
oftener
than
before
it
is
no
phenomenon
that
snagsby
should
be
ill
at
ease
too
for
he
always
is
so
more
or
less
under
the
oppressive
influence
of
the
secret
that
is
upon
him
impelled
by
the
mystery
of
which
he
is
a
partaker
and
yet
in
which
he
is
not
a
sharer
snagsby
haunts
what
seems
to
be
its
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
in
the
court
it
has
an
irresistible
attraction
for
him
even
now
coming
round
by
the
sol
arms
with
the
intention
of
passing
down
the
court
and
out
at
the
chancery
lane
end
and
so
terminating
his
unpremeditated
stroll
of
ten
minutes
long
from
his
own
door
and
back
again
snagsby
approaches
what
mr
weevle
says
the
stationer
stopping
to
speak
are
you
there
aye
says
weevle
here
i
am
mr
snagsby
airing
yourself
as
i
am
doing
before
you
go
to
bed
the
stationer
inquires
why
there
not
much
air
to
be
got
here
and
what
there
is
is
not
very
freshening
weevle
answers
glancing
up
and
down
the
court
very
true
sir
do
you
observe
says
snagsby
pausing
to
sniff
and
taste
the
air
a
little
do
you
observe
weevle
that
you
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
that
you
rather
greasy
here
sir
why
i
have
noticed
myself
that
there
is
a
queer
kind
of
flavour
in
the
place
weevle
rejoins
i
suppose
it
chops
at
the
sol
arms
chops
do
you
think
oh
chops
eh
snagsby
sniffs
and
tastes
again
well
sir
i
suppose
it
is
but
i
should
say
their
cook
at
the
sol
wanted
a
little
looking
after
she
has
been
burning
sir
and
i
do
think
snagsby
sniffs
and
tastes
again
and
then
spits
and
wipes
his
mouth
i
do
think
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
that
they
were
quite
fresh
when
they
were
shown
the
gridiron
that
very
likely
it
a
tainting
sort
of
weather
it
is
a
tainting
sort
of
weather
says
snagsby
and
i
find
it
sinking
to
the
spirits
by
george
i
find
it
gives
me
the
horrors
returns
weevle
then
you
see
you
live
in
a
lonesome
way
and
in
a
lonesome
room
with
a
black
circumstance
hanging
over
it
says
snagsby
looking
in
past
the
other
shoulder
along
the
dark
passage
and
then
falling
back
a
step
to
look
up
at
the
house
i
could
live
in
that
room
alone
as
you
do
sir
i
should
get
so
fidgety
and
worried
of
an
evening
sometimes
that
i
should
be
driven
to
come
to
the
door
and
stand
here
sooner
than
sit
there
but
then
it
very
true
that
you
did
see
in
your
room
what
i
saw
there
that
makes
a
difference
i
know
quite
enough
about
it
returns
tony
it
not
agreeable
is
it
pursues
snagsby
coughing
his
cough
of
mild
persuasion
behind
his
hand
krook
ought
to
consider
it
in
the
rent
i
hope
he
does
i
am
sure
i
hope
he
does
says
tony
but
i
doubt
it
you
find
the
rent
too
high
do
you
sir
returns
the
stationer
rents
are
high
about
here
i
do
know
how
it
is
exactly
but
the
law
seems
to
put
things
up
in
price
not
adds
snagsby
with
his
apologetic
cough
that
i
mean
to
say
a
word
against
the
profession
i
get
my
living
by
weevle
again
glances
up
and
down
the
court
and
then
looks
at
the
stationer
snagsby
blankly
catching
his
eye
looks
upward
for
a
star
or
so
and
coughs
a
cough
expressive
of
not
exactly
seeing
his
way
out
of
this
conversation
it
a
curious
fact
sir
he
observes
slowly
rubbing
his
hands
that
he
should
have
been
who
he
interrupts
weevle
the
deceased
you
know
says
snagsby
twitching
his
head
and
right
eyebrow
towards
the
staircase
and
tapping
his
acquaintance
on
the
button
ah
to
be
sure
returns
the
other
as
if
he
were
not
of
the
subject
i
thought
we
had
done
with
him
i
was
only
going
to
say
it
a
curious
fact
sir
that
he
should
have
come
and
lived
here
and
been
one
of
my
writers
and
then
that
you
should
come
and
live
here
and
be
one
of
my
writers
too
which
there
is
nothing
derogatory
but
far
from
it
in
the
appellation
says
snagsby
breaking
off
with
a
mistrust
that
he
may
have
unpolitely
asserted
a
kind
of
proprietorship
in
weevle
because
i
have
known
writers
that
have
gone
into
brewers
houses
and
done
really
very
respectable
indeed
eminently
respectable
sir
adds
snagsby
with
a
misgiving
that
he
has
not
improved
the
matter
it
a
curious
coincidence
as
you
say
answers
weevle
once
more
glancing
up
and
down
the
court
seems
a
fate
in
it
do
there
suggests
the
stationer
there
does
just
so
observes
the
stationer
with
his
confirmatory
cough
quite
a
fate
in
it
quite
a
fate
well
weevle
i
am
afraid
i
must
bid
you
good
night
snagsby
speaks
as
if
it
made
him
desolate
to
go
though
he
has
been
casting
about
for
any
means
of
escape
ever
since
he
stopped
to
speak
my
little
woman
will
be
looking
for
me
else
good
night
sir
if
snagsby
hastens
home
to
save
his
little
woman
the
trouble
of
looking
for
him
he
might
set
his
mind
at
rest
on
that
score
his
little
woman
has
had
her
eye
upon
him
round
the
sol
arms
all
this
time
and
now
glides
after
him
with
a
pocket
handkerchief
wrapped
over
her
head
honouring
weevle
and
his
doorway
with
a
searching
glance
as
she
goes
past
you
know
me
again
at
all
events
says
weevle
to
himself
and
i
ca
compliment
you
on
your
appearance
whoever
you
are
with
your
head
tied
up
in
a
bundle
is
this
fellow
never
coming
this
fellow
approaches
as
he
speaks
weevle
softly
holds
up
his
finger
and
draws
him
into
the
passage
and
closes
the
street
door
then
they
go
upstairs
weevle
heavily
and
guppy
for
it
is
he
very
lightly
indeed
when
they
are
shut
into
the
back
room
they
speak
low
i
thought
you
had
gone
to
jericho
at
least
instead
of
coming
here
says
tony
why
i
said
about
ten
you
said
about
ten
tony
repeats
yes
so
you
did
say
about
ten
but
according
to
my
count
it
ten
times
ten
it
a
hundred
i
never
had
such
a
night
in
my
life
what
has
been
the
matter
that
it
says
tony
nothing
has
been
the
matter
but
here
have
i
been
stewing
and
fuming
in
this
jolly
old
crib
till
i
have
had
the
horrors
falling
on
me
as
thick
as
hail
there
a
candle
says
tony
pointing
to
the
heavily
burning
taper
on
his
table
with
a
great
cabbage
head
and
a
long
that
easily
improved
guppy
observes
as
he
takes
the
snuffers
in
hand
is
it
returns
his
friend
not
so
easily
as
you
think
it
has
been
smouldering
like
that
ever
since
it
was
lighted
why
what
the
matter
with
you
tony
inquires
guppy
looking
at
him
snuffers
in
hand
as
he
sits
down
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
william
guppy
replies
the
other
i
am
in
the
downs
it
this
unbearably
dull
suicidal
room
and
old
boguey
downstairs
i
suppose
weevle
moodily
pushes
the
from
him
with
his
elbow
leans
his
head
on
his
hand
puts
his
feet
on
the
fender
and
looks
at
the
fire
guppy
observing
him
slightly
tosses
his
head
and
sits
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
in
an
easy
attitude
was
that
snagsby
talking
to
you
tony
yes
and
he
yes
it
was
snagsby
said
weevle
altering
the
construction
of
his
sentence
on
business
no
no
business
he
was
only
sauntering
by
and
stopped
to
prose
i
thought
it
was
snagsby
says
guppy
and
thought
it
as
well
that
he
should
see
me
so
i
waited
till
he
was
gone
there
we
go
again
william
cried
tony
looking
up
for
an
instant
so
mysterious
and
secret
by
george
if
we
were
going
to
commit
a
murder
we
could
have
more
mystery
about
it
guppy
affects
to
smile
and
with
the
view
of
changing
the
conversation
looks
with
an
admiration
real
or
pretended
round
the
room
at
the
galaxy
gallery
of
british
beauty
terminating
his
survey
with
the
portrait
of
lady
dedlock
over
the
mantelshelf
in
which
she
is
represented
on
a
terrace
with
a
pedestal
upon
the
terrace
and
a
vase
upon
the
pedestal
and
her
shawl
upon
the
vase
and
a
prodigious
piece
of
fur
upon
the
shawl
and
her
arm
on
the
prodigious
piece
of
fur
and
a
bracelet
on
her
arm
that
very
like
lady
dedlock
says
guppy
it
a
speaking
likeness
i
wish
it
was
growls
tony
without
changing
his
position
i
should
have
some
fashionable
conversation
here
then
finding
by
this
time
that
his
friend
is
not
to
be
wheedled
into
a
more
sociable
humour
guppy
puts
about
upon
the
tack
and
remonstrates
with
him
tony
says
he
i
can
make
allowances
for
lowness
of
spirits
for
no
man
knows
what
it
is
when
it
does
come
upon
a
man
better
than
i
do
and
no
man
perhaps
has
a
better
right
to
know
it
than
a
man
who
has
an
unrequited
image
imprinted
on
his
but
there
are
bounds
to
these
things
when
an
unoffending
party
is
in
question
and
i
will
acknowledge
to
you
tony
that
i
do
think
your
manner
on
the
present
occasion
is
hospitable
or
quite
gentlemanly
this
is
strong
language
william
guppy
returns
weevle
sir
it
may
be
retorts
william
guppy
but
i
feel
strongly
when
i
use
it
weevle
admits
that
he
has
been
wrong
and
begs
william
guppy
to
think
no
more
about
it
william
guppy
however
having
got
the
advantage
can
not
quite
release
it
without
a
little
more
injured
remonstrance
no
dash
it
tony
says
that
gentleman
you
really
ought
to
be
careful
how
you
wound
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
has
an
unrequited
image
imprinted
on
his
and
who
is
not
altogether
happy
in
those
chords
which
vibrate
to
the
tenderest
emotions
you
tony
possess
in
yourself
all
that
is
calculated
to
charm
the
eye
and
allure
the
taste
it
is
not
happily
for
you
perhaps
and
i
may
wish
that
i
could
say
the
same
it
is
not
your
character
to
hover
around
one
flower
the
ole
garden
is
open
to
you
and
your
airy
pinions
carry
you
through
it
still
tony
far
be
it
from
me
i
am
sure
to
wound
even
your
feelings
without
a
cause
tony
again
entreats
that
the
subject
may
be
no
longer
pursued
saying
emphatically
william
guppy
drop
it
guppy
acquiesces
with
the
reply
i
never
should
have
taken
it
up
tony
of
my
own
accord
and
now
says
tony
stirring
the
fire
touching
this
same
bundle
of
letters
is
it
an
extraordinary
thing
of
krook
to
have
appointed
twelve
to
hand
over
to
me
very
what
did
he
do
it
for
what
does
he
do
anything
for
he
do
know
said
was
his
birthday
and
he
hand
over
at
twelve
have
drunk
himself
blind
by
that
time
he
has
been
at
it
all
day
he
has
forgotten
the
appointment
i
hope
forgotten
trust
him
for
that
he
never
forgets
anything
i
saw
him
about
eight
helped
him
to
shut
up
his
shop
and
he
had
got
the
letters
then
in
his
hairy
cap
he
pulled
it
off
and
showed
me
when
the
shop
was
closed
he
took
them
out
of
his
cap
hung
his
cap
on
the
and
stood
turning
them
over
before
the
fire
i
heard
him
a
little
while
afterwards
through
the
floor
here
humming
like
the
wind
the
only
song
he
knows
about
bibo
and
old
charon
and
bibo
being
drunk
when
he
died
or
something
or
other
he
has
been
as
quiet
since
as
an
old
rat
asleep
in
his
hole
and
you
are
to
go
down
at
twelve
at
twelve
and
as
i
tell
you
when
you
came
it
seemed
to
me
a
hundred
tony
says
guppy
after
considering
a
little
with
his
legs
crossed
he
ca
read
yet
can
he
read
he
never
read
he
can
make
all
the
letters
separately
and
he
knows
most
of
them
separately
when
he
sees
them
he
has
got
on
that
much
under
me
but
he
ca
put
them
together
he
too
old
to
acquire
the
knack
of
it
now
and
too
drunk
tony
says
guppy
uncrossing
and
recrossing
his
legs
how
do
you
suppose
he
spelt
out
that
name
of
hawdon
he
never
spelt
it
out
you
know
what
a
curious
power
of
eye
he
has
and
how
he
has
been
used
to
employ
himself
in
copying
things
by
eye
alone
he
imitated
it
evidently
from
the
direction
of
a
letter
and
asked
me
what
it
meant
tony
says
guppy
uncrossing
and
recrossing
his
legs
again
should
you
say
that
the
original
was
a
man
writing
or
a
woman
a
woman
fifty
to
one
a
lady
slopes
a
good
deal
and
the
end
of
the
letter
long
and
hasty
guppy
has
been
biting
his
during
this
dialogue
generally
changing
the
thumb
when
he
has
changed
the
cross
leg
as
he
is
going
to
do
so
again
he
happens
to
look
at
his
it
takes
his
attention
he
stares
at
it
aghast
why
tony
what
on
earth
is
going
on
in
this
house
is
there
a
chimney
on
fire
chimney
on
fire
ah
returns
guppy
see
how
the
soot
falling
see
here
on
my
arm
see
again
on
the
table
here
confound
the
stuff
it
wo
blow
off
smears
like
black
fat
they
look
at
one
another
and
tony
goes
listening
to
the
door
and
a
little
way
upstairs
and
a
little
way
downstairs
comes
back
and
says
it
all
right
and
all
quiet
and
quotes
the
remark
he
lately
made
to
snagsby
about
their
cooking
chops
at
the
sol
arms
and
it
was
then
resumes
guppy
still
glancing
with
remarkable
aversion
at
the
as
they
pursue
their
conversation
before
the
fire
leaning
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
with
their
heads
very
near
together
that
he
told
you
of
his
having
taken
the
bundle
of
letters
from
his
lodger
portmanteau
that
was
the
time
sir
answers
tony
faintly
adjusting
his
whiskers
whereupon
i
wrote
a
line
to
my
dear
boy
the
honourable
william
guppy
informing
him
of
the
appointment
for
and
advising
him
not
to
call
before
boguey
being
a
slyboots
the
light
vivacious
tone
of
fashionable
life
which
is
usually
assumed
by
weevle
sits
so
ill
upon
him
that
he
abandons
that
and
his
whiskers
together
and
after
looking
over
his
shoulder
appears
to
yield
himself
up
a
prey
to
the
horrors
again
you
are
to
bring
the
letters
to
your
room
to
read
and
compare
and
to
get
yourself
into
a
position
to
tell
him
all
about
them
the
arrangement
is
it
tony
asks
guppy
anxiously
biting
his
you
ca
speak
too
low
yes
that
what
he
and
i
agreed
i
tell
you
what
tony
you
ca
speak
too
low
says
tony
once
more
guppy
nods
his
sagacious
head
advances
it
yet
closer
and
drops
into
a
whisper
i
tell
you
what
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
make
another
packet
like
the
real
one
so
that
if
he
should
ask
to
see
the
real
one
while
it
in
my
possession
you
can
show
him
the
dummy
and
suppose
he
detects
the
dummy
as
soon
as
he
sees
it
which
with
his
biting
screw
of
an
eye
is
about
five
hundred
times
more
likely
than
not
suggests
tony
then
we
face
it
out
they
do
belong
to
him
and
they
never
did
you
found
that
and
you
placed
them
in
my
hands
a
legal
friend
of
yours
for
security
if
he
forces
us
to
it
they
be
producible
wo
they
is
weevle
reluctant
admission
why
tony
remonstrates
his
friend
how
you
look
you
do
doubt
william
guppy
you
do
suspect
any
harm
i
do
suspect
anything
more
than
i
know
william
returns
the
other
gravely
and
what
do
you
know
urges
guppy
raising
his
voice
a
little
but
on
his
friend
once
more
warning
him
i
tell
you
you
speak
too
low
he
repeats
his
question
without
any
sound
at
all
forming
with
his
lips
only
the
words
what
do
you
know
i
know
three
things
first
i
know
that
here
we
are
whispering
in
secrecy
a
pair
of
conspirators
well
says
guppy
and
we
had
better
be
that
than
a
pair
of
noodles
which
we
should
be
if
we
were
doing
anything
else
for
the
only
way
of
doing
what
we
want
to
do
secondly
secondly
it
not
made
out
to
me
how
it
likely
to
be
profitable
after
all
guppy
casts
up
his
eyes
at
the
portrait
of
lady
dedlock
over
the
mantelshelf
and
replies
tony
you
are
asked
to
leave
that
to
the
honour
of
your
friend
besides
its
being
calculated
to
serve
that
friend
in
those
chords
of
the
human
mind
which
which
need
not
be
called
into
agonizing
vibration
on
the
present
occasion
your
friend
is
no
fool
what
that
it
eleven
striking
by
the
bell
of
saint
paul
listen
and
you
hear
all
the
bells
in
the
city
jangling
both
sit
silent
listening
to
the
metal
voices
near
and
distant
resounding
from
towers
of
various
heights
in
tones
more
various
than
their
situations
when
these
at
length
cease
all
seems
more
mysterious
and
quiet
than
before
one
disagreeable
result
of
whispering
is
that
it
seems
to
evoke
an
atmosphere
of
silence
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
sound
strange
cracks
and
tickings
the
rustling
of
garments
that
have
no
substance
in
them
and
the
tread
of
dreadful
feet
that
would
leave
no
mark
on
the
or
the
winter
snow
so
sensitive
the
two
friends
happen
to
be
that
the
air
is
full
of
these
phantoms
and
the
two
look
over
their
shoulders
by
one
consent
to
see
that
the
door
is
shut
yes
tony
says
guppy
drawing
nearer
to
the
fire
and
biting
his
unsteady
you
were
going
to
say
thirdly
it
far
from
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
plotting
about
a
dead
man
in
the
room
where
he
died
especially
when
you
happen
to
live
in
it
but
we
are
plotting
nothing
against
him
tony
may
be
not
still
i
do
like
it
live
here
by
yourself
and
see
how
you
like
it
as
to
dead
men
tony
proceeds
guppy
evading
this
proposal
there
have
been
dead
men
in
most
rooms
i
know
there
have
but
in
most
rooms
you
let
them
alone
and
and
they
let
you
alone
tony
answers
the
two
look
at
each
other
again
guppy
makes
a
hurried
remark
to
the
effect
that
they
may
be
doing
the
deceased
a
service
that
he
hopes
so
there
is
an
oppressive
blank
until
weevle
by
stirring
the
fire
suddenly
makes
guppy
start
as
if
his
heart
had
been
stirred
instead
fah
here
more
of
this
hateful
soot
hanging
about
says
he
let
us
open
the
window
a
bit
and
get
a
mouthful
of
air
it
too
close
he
raises
the
sash
and
they
both
rest
on
the
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
room
the
neighbouring
houses
are
too
near
to
admit
of
their
seeing
any
sky
without
craning
their
necks
and
looking
up
but
lights
in
frowsy
windows
here
and
there
and
the
rolling
of
distant
carriages
and
the
new
expression
that
there
is
of
the
stir
of
men
they
find
to
be
comfortable
guppy
noiselessly
tapping
on
the
resumes
his
whispering
in
quite
a
tone
by
the
by
tony
do
forget
old
smallweed
meaning
the
younger
of
that
name
i
have
not
let
him
into
this
you
know
that
grandfather
of
his
is
too
keen
by
half
it
runs
in
the
family
i
remember
says
tony
i
am
up
to
all
that
and
as
to
krook
resumes
guppy
now
do
you
suppose
he
really
has
got
hold
of
any
other
papers
of
importance
as
he
has
boasted
to
you
since
you
have
been
such
allies
tony
shakes
his
head
i
do
know
ca
imagine
if
we
get
through
this
business
without
rousing
his
suspicions
i
shall
be
better
informed
no
doubt
how
can
i
know
without
seeing
them
when
he
know
himself
he
is
always
spelling
out
words
from
them
and
chalking
them
over
the
table
and
the
and
asking
what
this
is
and
what
that
is
but
his
whole
stock
from
beginning
to
end
may
easily
be
the
he
bought
it
as
for
anything
i
can
say
it
a
monomania
with
him
to
think
he
is
possessed
of
documents
he
has
been
going
to
learn
to
read
them
this
last
quarter
of
a
century
i
should
judge
from
what
he
tells
me
how
did
he
first
come
by
that
idea
though
that
the
question
guppy
suggests
with
one
eye
shut
after
a
little
forensic
meditation
he
may
have
found
papers
in
something
he
bought
where
papers
were
not
supposed
to
be
and
may
have
got
it
into
his
shrewd
head
from
the
manner
and
place
of
their
concealment
that
they
are
worth
something
or
he
may
have
been
taken
in
in
some
pretended
bargain
or
he
may
have
been
muddled
altogether
by
long
staring
at
whatever
he
has
got
and
by
drink
and
by
hanging
about
the
lord
chancellor
court
and
hearing
of
documents
for
ever
returns
weevle
guppy
sitting
on
the
nodding
his
head
and
balancing
all
these
possibilities
in
his
mind
continues
thoughtfully
to
tap
it
and
clasp
it
and
measure
it
with
his
hand
until
he
hastily
draws
his
hand
away
what
in
the
devil
name
he
says
is
this
look
at
my
fingers
a
thick
yellow
liquor
defiles
them
which
is
offensive
to
the
touch
and
sight
and
more
offensive
to
the
smell
a
stagnant
sickening
oil
with
some
natural
repulsion
in
it
that
makes
them
both
shudder
what
have
you
been
doing
here
what
have
you
been
pouring
out
of
window
i
pouring
out
of
window
nothing
i
swear
never
since
i
have
been
here
cries
the
lodger
and
yet
look
here
and
look
here
when
he
brings
the
candle
here
from
the
corner
of
the
it
slowly
drips
and
creeps
away
down
the
bricks
here
lies
in
a
little
thick
nauseous
pool
this
is
a
horrible
house
says
guppy
shutting
down
the
window
give
me
some
water
or
i
shall
cut
my
hand
off
he
so
washes
and
rubs
and
scrubs
and
smells
and
washes
that
he
has
not
long
restored
himself
with
a
glass
of
brandy
and
stood
silently
before
the
fire
when
saint
paul
bell
strikes
twelve
and
all
those
other
bells
strike
twelve
from
their
towers
of
various
heights
in
the
dark
air
and
in
their
many
tones
when
all
is
quiet
again
the
lodger
says
it
the
appointed
time
at
last
shall
i
go
guppy
nods
and
gives
him
a
lucky
touch
on
the
back
but
not
with
the
washed
hand
though
it
is
his
right
hand
he
goes
downstairs
and
guppy
tries
to
compose
himself
before
the
fire
for
waiting
a
long
time
but
in
no
more
than
a
minute
or
two
the
stairs
creak
and
tony
comes
swiftly
back
have
you
got
them
got
them
no
the
old
man
not
there
he
has
been
so
horribly
frightened
in
the
short
interval
that
his
terror
seizes
the
other
who
makes
a
rush
at
him
and
asks
loudly
what
the
matter
i
could
make
him
hear
and
i
softly
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
and
the
burning
smell
is
there
and
the
soot
is
there
and
the
oil
is
there
and
he
is
not
there
tony
ends
this
with
a
groan
guppy
takes
the
light
they
go
down
more
dead
than
alive
and
holding
one
another
push
open
the
door
of
the
back
shop
the
cat
has
retreated
close
to
it
and
stands
snarling
not
at
them
at
something
on
the
ground
before
the
fire
there
is
a
very
little
fire
left
in
the
grate
but
there
is
a
smouldering
suffocating
vapour
in
the
room
and
a
dark
greasy
coating
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
the
chairs
and
table
and
the
bottle
so
rarely
absent
from
the
table
all
stand
as
usual
on
one
hang
the
old
man
hairy
cap
and
coat
look
whispers
the
lodger
pointing
his
friend
attention
to
these
objects
with
a
trembling
finger
i
told
you
so
when
i
saw
him
last
he
took
his
cap
off
took
out
the
little
bundle
of
old
letters
hung
his
cap
on
the
back
of
the
chair
his
coat
was
there
already
for
he
had
pulled
that
off
before
he
went
to
put
the
shutters
up
and
i
left
him
turning
the
letters
over
in
his
hand
standing
just
where
that
crumbled
black
thing
is
upon
the
floor
is
he
hanging
somewhere
they
look
up
no
see
whispers
tony
at
the
foot
of
the
same
chair
there
lies
a
dirty
bit
of
thin
red
cord
that
they
tie
up
pens
with
that
went
round
the
letters
he
undid
it
slowly
leering
and
laughing
at
me
before
he
began
to
turn
them
over
and
threw
it
there
i
saw
it
fall
what
the
matter
with
the
cat
says
guppy
look
at
her
mad
i
think
and
no
wonder
in
this
evil
place
they
advance
slowly
looking
at
all
these
things
the
cat
remains
where
they
found
her
still
snarling
at
the
something
on
the
ground
before
the
fire
and
between
the
two
chairs
what
is
it
hold
up
the
light
here
is
a
small
burnt
patch
of
flooring
here
is
the
tinder
from
a
little
bundle
of
burnt
paper
but
not
so
light
as
usual
seeming
to
be
steeped
in
something
and
here
is
is
it
the
cinder
of
a
small
charred
and
broken
log
of
wood
sprinkled
with
white
ashes
or
is
it
coal
oh
horror
he
is
here
and
this
from
which
we
run
away
striking
out
the
light
and
overturning
one
another
into
the
street
is
all
that
represents
him

help
help
come
into
this
house
for
heaven
sake
plenty
will
come
in
but
none
can
help
the

chancellor
of
that

true
to
his

it
to

you

or

it

eternally

interlopers
now
do
those
two
gentlemen
not
very
neat
about
the
cuffs
and
buttons
who
attended
the
last
coroner
inquest
at
the
sol
arms
reappear
in
the
precincts
with
surprising
swiftness
being
in
fact
breathlessly
fetched
by
the
active
and
intelligent
beadle
and
institute
perquisitions
through
the
court
and
dive
into
the
sol
parlour
and
write
with
ravenous
little
pens
on
now
do
they
note
down
in
the
watches
of
the
night
how
the
neighbourhood
of
chancery
lane
was
yesterday
at
about
midnight
thrown
into
a
state
of
the
most
intense
agitation
and
excitement
by
the
following
alarming
and
horrible
discovery
now
do
they
set
forth
how
it
will
doubtless
be
remembered
that
some
time
back
a
painful
sensation
was
created
in
the
public
mind
by
a
case
of
mysterious
death
from
opium
occurring
in
the
first
floor
of
the
house
occupied
as
a
rag
bottle
and
general
marine
store
shop
by
an
eccentric
individual
of
intemperate
habits
far
advanced
in
life
named
krook
and
how
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
krook
was
examined
at
the
inquest
which
it
may
be
recollected
was
held
on
that
occasion
at
the
sol
arms
a
tavern
immediately
adjoining
the
premises
in
question
on
the
west
side
and
licensed
to
a
highly
respectable
landlord
james
george
bogsby
now
do
they
show
in
as
many
words
as
possible
how
during
some
hours
of
yesterday
evening
a
very
peculiar
smell
was
observed
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
court
in
which
the
tragical
occurrence
which
forms
the
subject
of
that
present
account
transpired
and
which
odour
was
at
one
time
so
powerful
that
swills
a
comic
vocalist
professionally
engaged
by
bogsby
has
himself
stated
to
our
reporter
that
he
mentioned
to
miss
melvilleson
a
lady
of
some
pretensions
to
musical
ability
likewise
engaged
by
bogsby
to
sing
at
a
series
of
concerts
called
harmonic
assemblies
or
meetings
which
it
would
appear
are
held
at
the
sol
arms
under
bogsby
direction
pursuant
to
the
act
of
george
the
second
that
he
swills
found
his
voice
seriously
affected
by
the
impure
state
of
the
atmosphere
his
jocose
expression
at
the
time
being
that
he
was
like
an
empty
for
he
had
a
single
note
in
him
how
this
account
of
swills
is
entirely
corroborated
by
two
intelligent
married
females
residing
in
the
same
court
and
known
respectively
by
the
names
of
piper
and
perkins
both
of
whom
observed
the
foetid
effluvia
and
regarded
them
as
being
emitted
from
the
premises
in
the
occupation
of
krook
the
unfortunate
deceased
all
this
and
a
great
deal
more
the
two
gentlemen
who
have
formed
an
amicable
partnership
in
the
melancholy
catastrophe
write
down
on
the
spot
and
the
boy
population
of
the
court
out
of
bed
in
a
moment
swarm
up
the
shutters
of
the
arms
parlour
to
behold
the
tops
of
their
heads
while
they
are
about
it
the
whole
court
adult
as
well
as
boy
is
sleepless
for
that
night
and
can
do
nothing
but
wrap
up
its
many
heads
and
talk
of
the
house
and
look
at
it
miss
flite
has
been
bravely
rescued
from
her
chamber
as
if
it
were
in
flames
and
accommodated
with
a
bed
at
the
sol
arms
the
sol
neither
turns
off
its
gas
nor
shuts
its
door
all
night
for
any
kind
of
public
excitement
makes
good
for
the
sol
and
causes
the
court
to
stand
in
need
of
comfort
the
house
has
not
done
so
much
in
the
stomachic
article
of
cloves
or
in
warm
since
the
inquest
the
moment
the
heard
what
had
happened
he
rolled
up
his
tight
to
his
shoulders
and
said
there
be
a
run
upon
us
in
the
first
outcry
young
piper
dashed
off
for
the
and
returned
in
triumph
at
a
jolting
gallop
perched
up
aloft
on
the
phoenix
and
holding
on
to
that
fabulous
creature
with
all
his
might
in
the
midst
of
helmets
and
torches
one
helmet
remains
behind
after
careful
investigation
of
all
chinks
and
crannies
and
slowly
paces
up
and
down
before
the
house
in
company
with
one
of
the
two
policemen
who
have
likewise
been
left
in
charge
thereof
to
this
trio
everybody
in
the
court
possessed
of
sixpence
has
an
insatiate
desire
to
exhibit
hospitality
in
a
liquid
form
weevle
and
his
friend
guppy
are
within
the
bar
at
the
sol
and
are
worth
anything
to
the
sol
that
the
bar
contains
if
they
will
only
stay
there
this
is
not
a
time
says
bogsby
to
haggle
about
money
though
he
looks
something
sharply
after
it
over
the
counter
give
your
orders
you
two
gentlemen
and
you
welcome
to
whatever
you
put
a
name
to
thus
entreated
the
two
gentlemen
weevle
especially
put
names
to
so
many
things
that
in
course
of
time
they
find
it
difficult
to
put
a
name
to
anything
quite
distinctly
though
they
still
relate
to
all
some
version
of
the
night
they
have
had
of
it
and
of
what
they
said
and
what
they
thought
and
what
they
saw
meanwhile
one
or
other
of
the
policemen
often
flits
about
the
door
and
pushing
it
open
a
little
way
at
the
full
length
of
his
arm
looks
in
from
outer
gloom
not
that
he
has
any
suspicions
but
that
he
may
as
well
know
what
they
are
up
to
in
there
thus
night
pursues
its
leaden
course
finding
the
court
still
out
of
bed
through
the
unwonted
hours
still
treating
and
being
treated
still
conducting
itself
similarly
to
a
court
that
has
had
a
little
money
left
it
unexpectedly
thus
night
at
length
with
steps
departs
and
the
going
his
rounds
like
an
executioner
to
a
despotic
king
strikes
off
the
little
heads
of
fire
that
have
aspired
to
lessen
the
darkness
thus
the
day
cometh
whether
or
no
and
the
day
may
discern
even
with
its
dim
london
eye
that
the
court
has
been
up
all
night
over
and
above
the
faces
that
have
fallen
drowsily
on
tables
and
the
heels
that
lie
prone
on
hard
floors
instead
of
beds
the
brick
and
mortar
physiognomy
of
the
very
court
itself
looks
worn
and
jaded
and
now
the
neighbourhood
waking
up
and
beginning
to
hear
of
what
has
happened
comes
streaming
in
half
dressed
to
ask
questions
and
the
two
policemen
and
the
helmet
who
are
far
less
impressible
externally
than
the
court
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
the
door
good
gracious
gentlemen
says
snagsby
coming
up
what
this
i
hear
why
it
true
returns
one
of
the
policemen
that
what
it
is
now
move
on
here
come
why
good
gracious
gentlemen
says
snagsby
somewhat
promptly
backed
away
i
was
at
this
door
last
night
betwixt
ten
and
eleven
in
conversation
with
the
young
man
who
lodges
here
indeed
returns
the
policeman
you
will
find
the
young
man
next
door
then
now
move
on
here
some
of
you
not
hurt
i
hope
says
snagsby
hurt
no
what
to
hurt
him
snagsby
wholly
unable
to
answer
this
or
any
question
in
his
troubled
mind
repairs
to
the
sol
arms
and
finds
weevle
languishing
over
tea
and
toast
with
a
considerable
expression
on
him
of
exhausted
excitement
and
exhausted
and
guppy
likewise
quoth
snagsby
dear
dear
dear
what
a
fate
there
seems
in
all
this
and
my
lit
snagsby
power
of
speech
deserts
him
in
the
formation
of
the
words
my
little
woman
for
to
see
that
injured
female
walk
into
the
sol
arms
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
and
stand
before
the
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
like
an
accusing
spirit
strikes
him
dumb
my
dear
says
snagsby
when
his
tongue
is
loosened
will
you
take
anything
a
little
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
drop
of
shrub
no
says
snagsby
my
love
you
know
these
two
gentlemen
yes
says
snagsby
and
in
a
rigid
manner
acknowledges
their
presence
still
fixing
snagsby
with
her
eye
the
devoted
snagsby
can
not
bear
this
treatment
he
takes
snagsby
by
the
hand
and
leads
her
aside
to
an
adjacent
cask
my
little
woman
why
do
you
look
at
me
in
that
way
pray
do
do
it
i
ca
help
my
looks
says
snagsby
and
if
i
could
i
would
snagsby
with
his
cough
of
meekness
rejoins
would
you
really
my
dear
and
meditates
then
coughs
his
cough
of
trouble
and
says
this
is
a
dreadful
mystery
my
love
still
fearfully
disconcerted
by
snagsby
eye
it
is
returns
snagsby
shaking
her
head
a
dreadful
mystery
my
little
woman
urges
snagsby
in
a
piteous
manner
do
for
goodness
sake
speak
to
me
with
that
bitter
expression
and
look
at
me
in
that
searching
way
i
beg
and
entreat
of
you
not
to
do
it
good
lord
you
do
suppose
that
i
would
go
spontaneously
combusting
any
person
my
dear
i
ca
say
returns
snagsby
on
a
hasty
review
of
his
unfortunate
position
snagsby
say
either
he
is
not
prepared
positively
to
deny
that
he
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
he
has
had
something
he
do
know
what
to
do
with
so
much
in
this
connexion
that
is
mysterious
that
it
is
possible
he
may
even
be
implicated
without
knowing
it
in
the
present
transaction
he
faintly
wipes
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
and
gasps
my
life
says
the
unhappy
stationer
would
you
have
any
objections
to
mention
why
being
in
general
so
delicately
circumspect
in
your
conduct
you
come
into
a
before
breakfast
why
do
you
come
here
inquires
snagsby
my
dear
merely
to
know
the
rights
of
the
fatal
accident
which
has
happened
to
the
venerable
party
who
has
been
combusted
snagsby
has
made
a
pause
to
suppress
a
groan
i
should
then
have
related
them
to
you
my
love
over
your
french
roll
i
dare
say
you
would
you
relate
everything
to
me
mr
snagsby
every
my
lit
i
should
be
glad
says
snagsby
after
contemplating
his
increased
confusion
with
a
severe
and
sinister
smile
if
you
would
come
home
with
me
i
think
you
may
be
safer
there
snagsby
than
anywhere
else
my
love
i
do
know
but
what
i
may
be
i
am
sure
i
am
ready
to
go
snagsby
casts
his
eye
forlornly
round
the
bar
gives
weevle
and
guppy
good
morning
assures
them
of
the
satisfaction
with
which
he
sees
them
uninjured
and
accompanies
snagsby
from
the
sol
arms
before
night
his
doubt
whether
he
may
not
be
responsible
for
some
inconceivable
part
in
the
catastrophe
which
is
the
talk
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
is
almost
resolved
into
certainty
by
snagsby
pertinacity
in
that
fixed
gaze
his
mental
sufferings
are
so
great
that
he
entertains
wandering
ideas
of
delivering
himself
up
to
justice
and
requiring
to
be
cleared
if
innocent
and
punished
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
if
guilty
weevle
and
guppy
having
taken
their
breakfast
step
into
lincoln
inn
to
take
a
little
walk
about
the
square
and
clear
as
many
of
the
dark
cobwebs
out
of
their
brains
as
a
little
walk
may
there
can
be
no
more
favourable
time
than
the
present
tony
says
guppy
after
they
have
broodingly
made
out
the
four
sides
of
the
square
for
a
word
or
two
between
us
upon
a
point
on
which
we
must
with
very
little
delay
come
to
an
understanding
now
i
tell
you
what
william
returns
the
other
eyeing
his
companion
with
a
bloodshot
eye
if
it
a
point
of
conspiracy
you
need
take
the
trouble
to
mention
it
i
have
had
enough
of
that
and
i
ai
going
to
have
any
more
we
shall
have
you
taking
fire
next
or
blowing
up
with
a
bang
this
supposititious
phenomenon
is
so
very
disagreeable
to
guppy
that
his
voice
quakes
as
he
says
in
a
moral
way
tony
i
should
have
thought
that
what
we
went
through
last
night
would
have
been
a
lesson
to
you
never
to
be
personal
any
more
as
long
as
you
lived
to
which
weevle
returns
william
i
should
have
thought
it
would
have
been
a
lesson
to
you
never
to
conspire
any
more
as
long
as
you
lived
to
which
guppy
says
who
conspiring
to
which
jobling
replies
why
you
are
to
which
guppy
retorts
no
i
am
not
to
which
jobling
retorts
again
yes
you
are
to
which
guppy
retorts
who
says
so
to
which
jobling
retorts
i
say
so
to
which
guppy
retorts
oh
indeed
to
which
jobling
retorts
yes
indeed
and
both
being
now
in
a
heated
state
they
walk
on
silently
for
a
while
to
cool
down
again
tony
says
guppy
then
if
you
heard
your
friend
out
instead
of
flying
at
him
you
would
fall
into
mistakes
but
your
temper
is
hasty
and
you
are
not
considerate
possessing
in
yourself
tony
all
that
is
calculated
to
charm
the
eye
oh
blow
the
eye
cries
weevle
cutting
him
short
say
what
you
have
got
to
say
finding
his
friend
in
this
morose
and
material
condition
guppy
only
expresses
the
finer
feelings
of
his
soul
through
the
tone
of
injury
in
which
he
recommences
tony
when
i
say
there
is
a
point
on
which
we
must
come
to
an
understanding
pretty
soon
i
say
so
quite
apart
from
any
kind
of
conspiring
however
innocent
you
know
it
is
professionally
arranged
beforehand
in
all
cases
that
are
tried
what
facts
the
witnesses
are
to
prove
is
it
or
is
it
not
desirable
that
we
should
know
what
facts
we
are
to
prove
on
the
inquiry
into
the
death
of
this
unfortunate
old
mo
gentleman
guppy
was
going
to
say
mogul
but
thinks
gentleman
better
suited
to
the
circumstances
what
facts
the
facts
the
facts
bearing
on
that
inquiry
those
are
guppy
tells
them
off
on
his
fingers
what
we
knew
of
his
habits
when
you
saw
him
last
what
his
condition
was
then
the
discovery
that
we
made
and
how
we
made
it
yes
says
weevle
those
are
about
the
facts
we
made
the
discovery
in
consequence
of
his
having
in
his
eccentric
way
an
appointment
with
you
at
twelve
at
night
when
you
were
to
explain
some
writing
to
him
as
you
had
often
done
before
on
account
of
his
not
being
able
to
read
i
spending
the
evening
with
you
was
called
down
and
so
forth
the
inquiry
being
only
into
the
circumstances
touching
the
death
of
the
deceased
it
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
these
facts
i
suppose
you
agree
no
returns
weevle
i
suppose
not
and
this
is
not
a
conspiracy
perhaps
says
the
injured
guppy
no
returns
his
friend
if
it
nothing
worse
than
this
i
withdraw
the
observation
now
tony
says
guppy
taking
his
arm
again
and
walking
him
slowly
on
i
should
like
to
know
in
a
friendly
way
whether
you
have
yet
thought
over
the
many
advantages
of
your
continuing
to
live
at
that
place
what
do
you
mean
says
tony
stopping
whether
you
have
yet
thought
over
the
many
advantages
of
your
continuing
to
live
at
that
place
repeats
guppy
walking
him
on
again
at
what
place
that
place
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
guppy
nods
why
i
would
pass
another
night
there
for
any
consideration
that
you
could
offer
me
says
weevle
haggardly
staring
do
you
mean
it
though
tony
mean
it
do
i
look
as
if
i
mean
it
i
feel
as
if
i
do
i
know
that
says
weevle
with
a
very
genuine
shudder
then
the
possibility
or
probability
for
such
it
must
be
considered
of
your
never
being
disturbed
in
possession
of
those
effects
lately
belonging
to
a
lone
old
man
who
seemed
to
have
no
relation
in
the
world
and
the
certainty
of
your
being
able
to
find
out
what
he
really
had
got
stored
up
there
do
weigh
with
you
at
all
against
last
night
tony
if
i
understand
you
says
guppy
biting
his
thumb
with
the
appetite
of
vexation
certainly
not
talk
in
that
cool
way
of
a
fellow
living
there
cries
weevle
indignantly
go
and
live
there
yourself
oh
i
tony
says
guppy
soothing
him
i
have
never
lived
there
and
could
get
a
lodging
there
now
whereas
you
have
got
one
you
are
welcome
to
it
rejoins
his
friend
and
ugh
you
may
make
yourself
at
home
in
it
then
you
really
and
truly
at
this
point
says
guppy
give
up
the
whole
thing
if
i
understand
you
tony
you
never
returns
tony
with
a
most
convincing
steadfastness
said
a
truer
word
in
all
your
life
i
do
while
they
are
so
conversing
a
drives
into
the
square
on
the
box
of
which
vehicle
a
very
tall
hat
makes
itself
manifest
to
the
public
inside
the
coach
and
consequently
not
so
manifest
to
the
multitude
though
sufficiently
so
to
the
two
friends
for
the
coach
stops
almost
at
their
feet
are
the
venerable
smallweed
and
smallweed
accompanied
by
their
granddaughter
judy
an
air
of
haste
and
excitement
pervades
the
party
and
as
the
tall
hat
surmounting
smallweed
the
younger
alights
smallweed
the
elder
pokes
his
head
out
of
window
and
bawls
to
guppy
how
de
do
sir
how
de
do
what
do
chick
and
his
family
want
here
at
this
time
of
the
morning
i
wonder
says
guppy
nodding
to
his
familiar
my
dear
sir
cries
grandfather
smallweed
would
you
do
me
a
favour
would
you
and
your
friend
be
so
very
obleeging
as
to
carry
me
into
the
in
the
court
while
bart
and
his
sister
bring
their
grandmother
along
would
you
do
an
old
man
that
good
turn
sir
guppy
looks
at
his
friend
repeating
inquiringly
the
in
the
court
and
they
prepare
to
bear
the
venerable
burden
to
the
sol
arms
there
your
fare
says
the
patriarch
to
the
coachman
with
a
fierce
grin
and
shaking
his
incapable
fist
at
him
ask
me
for
a
penny
more
and
i
have
my
lawful
revenge
upon
you
my
dear
young
men
be
easy
with
me
if
you
please
allow
me
to
catch
you
round
the
neck
i
squeeze
you
tighter
than
i
can
help
oh
lord
oh
dear
me
oh
my
bones
it
is
well
that
the
sol
is
not
far
off
for
weevle
presents
an
apoplectic
appearance
before
half
the
distance
is
accomplished
with
no
worse
aggravation
of
his
symptoms
however
than
the
utterance
of
divers
croaking
sounds
expressive
of
obstructed
respiration
he
fulfils
his
share
of
the
porterage
and
the
benevolent
old
gentleman
is
deposited
by
his
own
desire
in
the
parlour
of
the
sol

about

from

oh
my
aches
and
pains
sit
down
you
dancing
prancing
shambling
scrambling
sit
down
this
little
apostrophe
to
smallweed
is
occasioned
by
a
propensity
on
the
part
of
that
unlucky
old
lady
whenever
she
finds
herself
on
her
feet
to
amble
about
and
set
to
inanimate
objects
accompanying
herself
with
a
chattering
noise
as
in
a
witch
dance
a
nervous
affection
has
probably
as
much
to
do
with
these
demonstrations
as
any
imbecile
intention
in
the
poor
old
woman
but
on
the
present
occasion
they
are
so
particularly
lively
in
connexion
with
the
windsor
fellow
to
that
in
which
smallweed
is
seated
that
she
only
quite
desists
when
her
grandchildren
have
held
her
down
in
it
her
lord
in
the
meanwhile
bestowing
upon
her
with
great
volubility
the
endearing
epithet
of
a
jackdaw
repeated
a
surprising
number
of
times
my
dear
sir
grandfather
smallweed
then
proceeds
addressing
guppy
there
has
been
a
calamity
here
have
you
heard
of
it
either
of
you
heard
of
it
sir
why
we
discovered
it
you
discovered
it
you
two
discovered
it
bart
they
discovered
it
the
two
discoverers
stare
at
the
smallweeds
who
return
the
compliment
my
dear
friends
whines
grandfather
smallweed
putting
out
both
his
hands
i
owe
you
a
thousand
thanks
for
discharging
the
melancholy
office
of
discovering
the
ashes
of
smallweed
brother
eh
says
guppy
smallweed
brother
my
dear
friend
her
only
relation
we
were
not
on
terms
which
is
to
be
deplored
now
but
he
never
would
be
on
terms
he
was
not
fond
of
us
he
was
eccentric
he
was
very
eccentric
unless
he
has
left
a
will
which
is
not
at
all
likely
i
shall
take
out
letters
of
administration
i
have
come
down
to
look
after
the
property
it
must
be
sealed
up
it
must
be
protected
i
have
come
down
repeats
grandfather
smallweed
hooking
the
air
towards
him
with
all
his
ten
fingers
at
once
to
look
after
the
property
i
think
small
says
the
disconsolate
guppy
you
might
have
mentioned
that
the
old
man
was
your
uncle
you
two
were
so
close
about
him
that
i
thought
you
would
like
me
to
be
the
same
returns
that
old
bird
with
a
secretly
glistening
eye
besides
i
was
proud
of
him
besides
which
it
was
nothing
to
you
you
know
whether
he
was
or
not
says
judy
also
with
a
secretly
glistening
eye
he
never
saw
me
in
his
life
to
know
me
observed
small
i
know
why
i
should
introduce
him
i
am
sure
no
he
never
communicated
with
us
which
is
to
be
deplored
the
old
gentleman
strikes
in
but
i
have
come
to
look
after
the
property
to
look
over
the
papers
and
to
look
after
the
property
we
shall
make
good
our
title
it
is
in
the
hands
of

so
good
as
to
act

can
tell
ye

speaking
of

exclaims
her
exasperated

looking
helplessly
about
him
and
finding
no
missile
within
his
reach
will
somebody
obleege
me
with
a
spittoon

somebody
hand
me
anything
hard

wrought
up
to
the

pitch
by
his

eloquence
actually
throws
judy
at
her
grandmother
in
default
of
anything
else
by
butting
that
young
virgin
at
the
old
lady
with
such
force
as
he
can
muster
and
then
dropping
into
his
chair
in
a
heap
shake
me
up
somebody
if
you
be
so
good
says
the
voice
from
within
the
faintly
struggling
bundle
into
which
he
has
collapsed

have
come
to
look
after

shake
me
up
and
call
in
the

on
duty
at
the
next

to

to
about

my

will
be

presently
to

up

at
each

the
former
as
having
relinquished
the
whole
affair
the
latter
with
a
discomfited
countenance
as
having
entertained
some
lingering
expectations
yet
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
in
opposition
to
the
smallweed
interest
tulkinghorn
clerk
comes
down
from
his
official
pew
in
the
chambers
to
mention
to
the
police
that
tulkinghorn
is
answerable
for
its
being
all
correct
about
the
next
of
kin
and
that
the
papers
and
effects
will
be
formally
taken
possession
of
in
due
time
and
course
smallweed
is
at
once
permitted
so
far
to
assert
his
supremacy
as
to
be
carried
on

death
with
chorus
by

as
the

harmonic
feature
of

announces
in

that
is
induced
to
do
so
at
a
considerable
extra
expense
in
consequence
of
a
wish
which
has
been
very
generally
expressed
at
the
bar
by
a
large
body
of
respectable
individuals
and
in
homage
to
a
late
melancholy
event
which
has
aroused
so
much
sensation
there
is
one
point
connected
with
the
deceased
upon
which
the
court
is
particularly
anxious
namely
that
the
fiction
of
a
coffin
should
be
preserved
though
there
is
so
little
to
put
in
it
upon
the
undertaker
stating
in
the
sol
bar
in
the
course
of
the
day
that
he
has
received
orders
to
construct
a
the
general
solicitude
is
much
relieved
and
it
is
considered
that
smallweed
conduct
does
him
great
honour
out
of
the
court
and
a
long
way
out
of
it
there
is
considerable
excitement
too
for
men
of
science
and
philosophy
come
to
look
and
carriages
set
down
doctors
at
the
corner
who
arrive
with
the
same
intent
and
there
is
more
learned
talk
about
inflammable
gases
and
phosphuretted
hydrogen
than
the
court
has
ever
imagined
some
of
these
authorities
of
course
the
wisest
hold
with
indignation
that
the
deceased
had
no
business
to
die
in
the
alleged
manner
and
being
reminded
by
other
authorities
of
a
certain
inquiry
into
the
evidence
for
such
deaths
reprinted
in
the
sixth
volume
of
the
philosophical
transactions
and
also
of
a
book
not
quite
unknown
on
english
medical
jurisprudence
and
likewise
of
the
italian
case
of
the
countess
cornelia
baudi
as
set
forth
in
detail
by
one
bianchini
prebendary
of
verona
who
wrote
a
scholarly
work
or
so
and
was
occasionally
heard
of
in
his
time
as
having
gleams
of
reason
in
him
and
also
of
the
testimony
of
fodere
and
mere
two
pestilent
frenchmen
who
would
investigate
the
subject
and
further
of
the
corroborative
testimony
of
monsieur
le
cat
a
rather
celebrated
french
surgeon
once
upon
a
time
who
had
the
unpoliteness
to
live
in
a
house
where
such
a
case
occurred
and
even
to
write
an
account
of
it
still
they
regard
the
late
krook
obstinacy
in
going
out
of
the
world
by
any
such
as
wholly
unjustifiable
and
personally
offensive
the
less
the
court
understands
of
all
this
the
more
the
court
likes
it
and
the
greater
enjoyment
it
has
in
the
stock
in

of
the
sol
arms

there
comes
the
artist
of
a

with
a

and

drawn
for
anything
from
a

on
the

to

at

of
the
fatal

he
depicts
that

as
of
a
mile
long
by
fifty
yards
high
at
which
the
court
is
particularly
charmed

this

two
gentlemen

in

out
of
every

at
the
philosophical

everywhere
and

to

his
inquiry

as
before

that
the
coroner
cherishes
this
case
as
being
out
of
the
common
way

tells
the
gentlemen
of

his
private
capacity

into

much
admired
in
all
these
proceedings
guppy
has
so
slight
a
part
except
when
he
gives
his
evidence
that
he
is
moved
on
like
a
private
individual
and
can
only
haunt
the
secret
house
on
the
outside
where
he
has
the
mortification
of
seeing
smallweed
padlocking
the
door
and
of
bitterly
knowing
himself
to
be
shut
out
but
before
these
proceedings
draw
to
a
close
that
is
to
say
on
the
night
next
after
the
catastrophe
guppy
has
a
thing
to
say
that
must
be
said
to
lady
dedlock
for
which
reason
with
a
sinking
heart
and
with
that
sense
of
guilt
upon
him
which
dread
and
watching
enfolded
in
the
sol
arms
have
produced
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
presents
himself
at
the
town
mansion
at
about
seven
in
the
evening
and
requests
to
see
her
ladyship
mercury
replies
that
she
is
going
out
to
dinner
do
he
see
the
carriage
at
the
door
yes
he
does
see
the
carriage
at
the
door
but
he
wants
to
see
my
lady
too
mercury
is
disposed
as
he
will
presently
declare
to
a
in
waiting
to
pitch
into
the
young
man
but
his
instructions
are
positive
therefore
he
sulkily
supposes
that
the
young
man
must
come
up
into
the
library
there
he
leaves
the
young
man
in
a
large
room
not
while
he
makes
report
of
him
guppy
looks
into
the
shade
in
all
directions
discovering
everywhere
a
certain
charred
and
whitened
little
heap
of
coal
or
wood
presently
he
hears
a
rustling
is
it
no
it
no
ghost
but
fair
flesh
and
blood
most
brilliantly
dressed
i
have
to
beg
your
ladyship
pardon
guppy
stammers
very
downcast
this
is
an
inconvenient
time
i
told
you
you
could
come
at
any
time
she
takes
a
chair
looking
straight
at
him
as
on
the
last
occasion
thank
your
ladyship
your
ladyship
is
very
affable
you
can
sit
down
there
is
not
much
affability
in
her
tone
i
do
know
your
ladyship
that
it
worth
while
my
sitting
down
and
detaining
you
for
i
i
have
not
got
the
letters
that
i
mentioned
when
i
had
the
honour
of
waiting
on
your
ladyship
have
you
come
merely
to
say
so
merely
to
say
so
your
ladyship
guppy
besides
being
depressed
disappointed
and
uneasy
is
put
at
a
further
disadvantage
by
the
splendour
and
beauty
of
her
appearance
she
knows
its
influence
perfectly
has
studied
it
too
well
to
miss
a
grain
of
its
effect
on
any
one
as
she
looks
at
him
so
steadily
and
coldly
he
not
only
feels
conscious
that
he
has
no
guide
in
the
least
perception
of
what
is
really
the
complexion
of
her
thoughts
but
also
that
he
is
being
every
moment
as
it
were
removed
further
and
further
from
her
she
will
not
speak
it
is
plain
so
he
must
in
short
your
ladyship
says
guppy
like
a
meanly
penitent
thief
the
person
i
was
to
have
had
the
letters
of
has
come
to
a
sudden
end
and
he
stops
lady
dedlock
calmly
finishes
the
sentence
and
the
letters
are
destroyed
with
the
person
guppy
would
say
no
if
he
could
as
he
is
unable
to
hide
i
believe
so
your
ladyship
if
he
could
see
the
least
sparkle
of
relief
in
her
face
now
no
he
could
see
no
such
thing
even
if
that
brave
outside
did
not
utterly
put
him
away
and
he
were
not
looking
beyond
it
and
about
it
he
falters
an
awkward
excuse
or
two
for
his
failure
is
this
all
you
have
to
say
inquires
lady
dedlock
having
heard
him
out
or
as
nearly
out
as
he
can
stumble
guppy
thinks
that
all
you
had
better
be
sure
that
you
wish
to
say
nothing
more
to
me
this
being
the
last
time
you
will
have
the
opportunity
guppy
is
quite
sure
and
indeed
he
has
no
such
wish
at
present
by
any
means
that
is
enough
i
will
dispense
with
excuses
good
evening
to
you
and
she
rings
for
mercury
to
show
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
out
but
in
that
house
in
that
same
moment
there
happens
to
be
an
old
man
of
the
name
of
tulkinghorn
and
that
old
man
coming
with
his
quiet
footstep
to
the
library
has
his
hand
at
that
moment
on
the
handle
of
the
door
comes
in
and
comes
face
to
face
with
the
young
man
as
he
is
leaving
the
room
one
glance
between
the
old
man
and
the
lady
and
for
an
instant
the
blind
that
is
always
down
flies
up
suspicion
eager
and
sharp
looks
out
another
instant
close
again
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
dedlock
i
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
it
is
so
very
unusual
to
find
you
here
at
this
hour
i
supposed
the
room
was
empty
i
beg
your
pardon
stay
she
negligently
calls
him
back
remain
here
i
beg
i
am
going
out
to
dinner
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
this
young
man
the
disconcerted
young
man
bows
as
he
goes
out
and
cringingly
hopes
that
tulkinghorn
of
the
fields
is
well
aye
aye
says
the
lawyer
looking
at
him
from
under
his
bent
brows
though
he
has
no
need
to
look
again
not
he
from
kenge
and
carboy
surely

tulkinghorn
name
of
guppy

to
be

very
well
happy

too
well

for
the
credit

thank

mr

guppy
sneaks
away
tulkinghorn
such
a
foil
in
his
rusty
black
to
lady
dedlock
brightness
hands
her
down
the
staircase
to
her
carriage
he
returns
rubbing
his
chin
and
rubs
it
a
good
deal
in
the
course
of
the
evening
chapter
xxxiv
a
turn
of
the
screw
now
what
says
george
may
this
be
is
it
blank
cartridge
or
ball
a
flash
in
the
pan
or
a
shot
an
open
letter
is
the
subject
of
the
trooper
speculations
and
it
seems
to
perplex
him
mightily
he
looks
at
it
at
arm
length
brings
it
close
to
him
holds
it
in
his
right
hand
holds
it
in
his
left
hand
reads
it
with
his
head
on
this
side
with
his
head
on
that
side
contracts
his
eyebrows
elevates
them
still
can
not
satisfy
himself
he
smooths
it
out
upon
the
table
with
his
heavy
palm
and
thoughtfully
walking
up
and
down
the
gallery
makes
a
halt
before
it
every
now
and
then
to
come
upon
it
with
a
fresh
eye
even
that
do
is
it
george
still
muses
blank
cartridge
or
ball
phil
squod
with
the
aid
of
a
brush
and
is
employed
in
the
distance
whitening
the
targets
softly
whistling
in
time
and
in
manner
that
he
must
and
will
go
back
again
to
the
girl
he
left
behind
him
phil
the
trooper
beckons
as
he
calls
him
phil
approaches
in
his
usual
way
sidling
off
at
first
as
if
he
were
going
anywhere
else
and
then
bearing
down
upon
his
commander
like
a
certain
splashes
of
white
show
in
high
relief
upon
his
dirty
face
and
he
scrapes
his
one
eyebrow
with
the
handle
of
the
brush
attention
phil
listen
to
this
steady
commander
steady
allow
me
to
remind
you
though
there
is
no
legal
necessity
for
my
doing
so
as
you
are
aware
that
the
bill
at
two
months
date
drawn
on
yourself
by
matthew
bagnet
and
by
you
accepted
for
the
sum
of
pounds
four
shillings
and
ninepence
will
become
due
when
you
will
please
be
prepared
to
take
up
the
same
on
presentation
yours
joshua
smallweed
what
do
you
make
of
that
phil
mischief
why
i
think
replies
phil
after
pensively
tracing
out
a
in
his
forehead
with
the
that
mischeevious
consequences
is
always
meant
when
money
asked
for
lookye
phil
says
the
trooper
sitting
on
the
table
first
and
last
i
have
paid
i
may
say
half
as
much
again
as
this
principal
in
interest
and
one
thing
and
another
phil
intimates
by
sidling
back
a
pace
or
two
with
a
very
unaccountable
wrench
of
his
wry
face
that
he
does
not
regard
the
transaction
as
being
made
more
promising
by
this
incident
and
lookye
further
phil
says
the
trooper
staying
his
premature
conclusions
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
there
has
always
been
an
understanding
that
this
bill
was
to
be
what
they
call
renewed
and
it
has
been
renewed
no
end
of
times
what
do
you
say
now
i
say
that
i
think
the
times
is
come
to
a
end
at
last
you
do
humph
i
am
much
of
the
same
mind
myself
joshua
smallweed
is
him
that
was
brought
here
in
a
chair
the
same
says
phil
with
exceeding
gravity
he
a
leech
in
his
dispositions
he
a
screw
and
a
wice
in
his
actions
a
snake
in
his
twistings
and
a
lobster
in
his
claws
having
thus
expressively
uttered
his
sentiments
squod
after
waiting
a
little
to
ascertain
if
any
further
remark
be
expected
of
him
gets
back
by
his
usual
series
of
movements
to
the
target
he
has
in
hand
and
vigorously
signifies
through
his
former
musical
medium
that
he
must
and
he
will
return
to
that
ideal
young
lady
george
having
folded
the
letter
walks
in
that
direction
there
is
a
way
commander
says
phil
looking
cunningly
at
him
of
settling
this
paying
the
money
i
suppose
i
wish
i
could
phil
shakes
his
head
no
no
not
so
bad
as
that
there
is
a
way
says
phil
with
a
highly
artistic
turn
of
his
brush
what
at
present
whitewashing
phil
nods
a
pretty
way
that
would
be
do
you
know
what
would
become
of
the
bagnets
in
that
case
do
you
know
they
would
be
ruined
to
pay
off
my
old
scores
you
a
moral
character
says
the
trooper
eyeing
him
in
his
large
way
with
no
small
indignation
upon
my
life
you
are
phil
phil
on
one
knee
at
the
target
is
in
course
of
protesting
earnestly
though
not
without
many
allegorical
scoops
of
his
brush
and
smoothings
of
the
white
surface
round
the
rim
with
his
thumb
that
he
had
forgotten
the
bagnet
responsibility
and
would
not
so
much
as
injure
a
hair
of
the
head
of
any
member
of
that
worthy
family
when
steps
are
audible
in
the
long
passage
without
and
a
cheerful
voice
is
heard
to
wonder
whether
george
is
at
home
phil
with
a
look
at
his
master
hobbles
up
saying
here
the
bagnet
here
he
is
and
the
old
girl
herself
accompanied
by
bagnet
appears
the
old
girl
never
appears
in
walking
trim
in
any
season
of
the
year
without
a
grey
cloth
cloak
coarse
and
much
worn
but
very
clean
which
is
undoubtedly
the
identical
garment
rendered
so
interesting
to
bagnet
by
having
made
its
way
home
to
europe
from
another
quarter
of
the
globe
in
company
with
bagnet
and
an
umbrella
the
latter
faithful
appendage
is
also
invariably
a
part
of
the
old
girl
presence
out
of
doors
it
is
of
no
colour
known
in
this
life
and
has
a
corrugated
wooden
crook
for
a
handle
with
a
metallic
object
let
into
its
prow
or
beak
resembling
a
little
model
of
a
fanlight
over
a
street
door
or
one
of
the
oval
glasses
out
of
a
pair
of
spectacles
which
ornamental
object
has
not
that
tenacious
capacity
of
sticking
to
its
post
that
might
be
desired
in
an
article
long
associated
with
the
british
army
the
old
girl
umbrella
is
of
a
flabby
habit
of
waist
and
seems
to
be
in
need
of
stays
an
appearance
that
is
possibly
referable
to
its
having
served
through
a
series
of
years
at
home
as
a
cupboard
and
on
journeys
as
a
carpet
bag
she
never
puts
it
up
having
the
greatest
reliance
on
her
cloak
with
its
capacious
hood
but
generally
uses
the
instrument
as
a
wand
with
which
to
point
out
joints
of
meat
or
bunches
of
greens
in
marketing
or
to
arrest
the
attention
of
tradesmen
by
a
friendly
poke
without
her
which
is
a
sort
of
wicker
well
with
two
flapping
lids
she
never
stirs
abroad
attended
by
these
her
trusty
companions
therefore
her
honest
sunburnt
face
looking
cheerily
out
of
a
rough
straw
bonnet
bagnet
now
arrives
and
bright
in
george
shooting
gallery
well
george
old
fellow
says
she
and
how
do
you
do
this
sunshiny
morning
giving
him
a
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
bagnet
draws
a
long
breath
after
her
walk
and
sits
down
to
enjoy
a
rest
having
a
faculty
matured
on
the
tops
of
and
in
other
such
positions
of
resting
easily
anywhere
she
perches
on
a
rough
bench
unties
her
pushes
back
her
bonnet
crosses
her
arms
and
looks
perfectly
comfortable
bagnet
in
the
meantime
has
shaken
hands
with
his
old
comrade
and
with
phil
on
whom
bagnet
likewise
bestows
a
nod
and
smile
now
george
said
bagnet
briskly
here
we
are
lignum
and
myself
she
often
speaks
of
her
husband
by
this
appellation
on
account
as
it
is
supposed
of
lignum
vitae
having
been
his
old
regimental
nickname
when
they
first
became
acquainted
in
compliment
to
the
extreme
hardness
and
toughness
of
his
physiognomy
just
looked
in
we
have
to
make
it
all
correct
as
usual
about
that
security
give
him
the
new
bill
to
sign
george
and
he
sign
it
like
a
man
i
was
coming
to
you
this
morning
observes
the
trooper
reluctantly
yes
we
thought
you
come
to
us
this
morning
but
we
turned
out
early
and
left
woolwich
the
best
of
boys
to
mind
his
sisters
and
came
to
you
instead
as
you
see
for
lignum
he
tied
so
close
now
and
gets
so
little
exercise
that
a
walk
does
him
good
but
the
matter
george
asks
bagnet
stopping
in
her
cheerful
talk
you
do
look
yourself
i
am
not
quite
myself
returns
the
trooper
i
have
been
a
little
put
out
mrs
bagnet
her
bright
quick
eye
catches
the
truth
directly
george
holding
up
her
forefinger
do
tell
me
there
anything
wrong
about
that
security
of
lignum
do
do
it
george
on
account
of
the
children
the
trooper
looks
at
her
with
a
troubled
visage
george
says
bagnet
using
both
her
arms
for
emphasis
and
occasionally
bringing
down
her
open
hands
upon
her
knees
if
you
have
allowed
anything
wrong
to
come
to
that
security
of
lignum
and
if
you
have
let
him
in
for
it
and
if
you
have
put
us
in
danger
of
being
sold
up
and
i
see
sold
up
in
your
face
george
as
plain
as
print
you
have
done
a
shameful
action
and
have
deceived
us
cruelly
i
tell
you
cruelly
george
there
bagnet
otherwise
as
immovable
as
a
pump
or
a
puts
his
large
right
hand
on
the
top
of
his
bald
head
as
if
to
defend
it
from
a
and
looks
with
great
uneasiness
at
bagnet
george
says
that
old
girl
i
wonder
at
you
george
i
am
ashamed
of
you
george
i
could
have
believed
you
would
have
done
it
i
always
knew
you
to
be
a
rolling
stone
that
gathered
no
moss
but
i
never
thought
you
would
have
taken
away
what
little
moss
there
was
for
bagnet
and
the
children
to
lie
upon
you
know
what
a
chap
he
is
you
know
what
quebec
and
malta
and
woolwich
are
and
i
never
did
think
you
would
or
could
have
had
the
heart
to
serve
us
so
oh
george
bagnet
gathers
up
her
cloak
to
wipe
her
eyes
on
in
a
very
genuine
manner
how
could
you
do
it
bagnet
ceasing
bagnet
removes
his
hand
from
his
head
as
if
the
were
over
and
looks
disconsolately
at
george
who
has
turned
quite
white
and
looks
distressfully
at
the
grey
cloak
and
straw
bonnet
mat
says
the
trooper
in
a
subdued
voice
addressing
him
but
still
looking
at
his
wife
i
am
sorry
you
take
it
so
much
to
heart
because
i
do
hope
it
not
so
bad
as
that
comes
to
i
certainly
have
this
morning
received
this
letter
which
he
reads
aloud
but
i
hope
it
may
be
set
right
yet
as
to
a
rolling
stone
why
what
you
say
is
true
i
am
a
rolling
stone
and
i
never
rolled
in
way
i
fully
believe
that
i
rolled
the
least
good
to
but
impossible
for
an
old
vagabond
comrade
to
like
your
wife
and
family
better
than
i
like
mat
and
i
trust
you
look
upon
me
as
forgivingly
as
you
can
do
think
i
kept
anything
from
you
i
have
had
the
letter
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
old
girl
murmurs
bagnet
after
a
short
silence
will
you
tell
him
my
opinion
oh
why
did
he
marry
bagnet
answers
half
laughing
and
half
crying
joe
pouch
widder
in
north
america
then
he
have
got
himself
into
these
troubles
the
old
girl
says
bagnet
puts
it
correct
why
did
you
well
she
has
a
better
husband
by
this
time
i
hope
returns
the
trooper
anyhow
here
i
stand
this
present
day
not
married
to
joe
pouch
widder
what
shall
i
do
you
see
all
i
have
got
about
me
it
not
mine
it
yours
give
the
word
and
i
sell
off
every
morsel
if
i
could
have
hoped
it
would
have
brought
in
nearly
the
sum
wanted
i
have
sold
all
long
ago
do
believe
that
i
leave
you
or
yours
in
the
lurch
mat
i
sell
myself
first
i
only
wish
says
the
trooper
giving
himself
a
disparaging
blow
in
the
chest
that
i
knew
of
any
one
who
buy
such
a
piece
of
old
stores
old
girl
murmurs
bagnet
give
him
another
bit
of
my
mind
george
says
the
old
girl
you
are
not
so
much
to
be
blamed
on
full
consideration
except
for
ever
taking
this
business
without
the
means
and
that
was
like
me
observes
the
penitent
trooper
shaking
his
head
like
me
i
know
silence
the
old
girl
says
bagnet
is
correct
in
her
way
of
giving
my
opinions
hear
me
out
that
was
when
you
never
ought
to
have
asked
for
the
security
george
and
when
you
never
ought
to
have
got
it
all
things
considered
but
what
done
ca
be
undone
you
are
always
an
honourable
and
straightforward
fellow
as
far
as
lays
in
your
power
though
a
little
flighty
on
the
other
hand
you
ca
admit
but
what
it
natural
in
us
to
be
anxious
with
such
a
thing
hanging
over
our
heads
so
forget
and
forgive
all
round
george
come
forget
and
forgive
all
round
bagnet
giving
him
one
of
her
honest
hands
and
giving
her
husband
the
other
george
gives
each
of
them
one
of
his
and
holds
them
while
he
speaks
i
do
assure
you
both
there
nothing
i
would
do
to
discharge
this
obligation
but
whatever
i
have
been
able
to
scrape
together
has
gone
every
two
months
in
keeping
it
up
we
have
lived
plainly
enough
here
phil
and
i
but
the
gallery
do
quite
do
what
was
expected
of
it
and
it
not
in
short
it
not
the
mint
it
was
wrong
in
me
to
take
it
well
so
it
was
but
i
was
in
a
manner
drawn
into
that
step
and
i
thought
it
might
steady
me
and
set
me
up
and
you
try
to
overlook
my
having
such
expectations
and
upon
my
soul
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
and
very
much
ashamed
of
myself
with
these
concluding
words
george
gives
a
shake
to
each
of
the
hands
he
holds
and
relinquishing
them
backs
a
pace
or
two
in
a
upright
attitude
as
if
he
had
made
a
final
confession
and
were
immediately
going
to
be
shot
with
all
military
honours
george
hear
me
out
says
bagnet
glancing
at
his
wife
old
girl
go
on
bagnet
being
in
this
singular
manner
heard
out
has
merely
to
observe
that
the
letter
must
be
attended
to
without
any
delay
that
it
is
advisable
that
george
and
he
should
immediately
wait
on
smallweed
in
person
and
that
the
primary
object
is
to
save
and
hold
harmless
bagnet
who
had
none
of
the
money
george
entirely
assenting
puts
on
his
hat
and
prepares
to
march
with
bagnet
to
the
enemy
camp
do
you
mind
a
woman
hasty
word
george
says
bagnet
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
i
trust
my
old
lignum
to
you
and
i
am
sure
you
bring
him
through
it
the
trooper
returns
that
this
is
kindly
said
and
that
he
will
bring
lignum
through
it
somehow
upon
which
bagnet
with
her
cloak
basket
and
umbrella
goes
home
again
to
the
rest
of
her
family
and
the
comrades
sally
forth
on
the
hopeful
errand
of
mollifying
smallweed
whether
there
are
two
people
in
england
less
likely
to
come
satisfactorily
out
of
any
negotiation
with
smallweed
than
george
and
matthew
bagnet
may
be
very
reasonably
questioned
also
notwithstanding
their
martial
appearance
broad
square
shoulders
and
heavy
tread
whether
there
are
within
the
same
limits
two
more
simple
and
unaccustomed
children
in
all
the
smallweedy
affairs
of
life
as
they
proceed
with
great
gravity
through
the
streets
towards
the
region
of
mount
pleasant
bagnet
observing
his
companion
to
be
thoughtful
considers
it
a
friendly
part
to
refer
to
bagnet
late
sally
george
you
know
the
old
girl
she
as
sweet
and
as
mild
as
milk
but
touch
her
on
the
children
or
myself
and
she
off
like
gunpowder
it
does
her
credit
mat
george
says
bagnet
looking
straight
before
him
the
old
girl
ca
do
anything
that
do
do
her
credit
more
or
less
i
never
say
so
discipline
must
be
maintained
she
worth
her
weight
in
gold
says
the
trooper
in
gold
says
bagnet
i
tell
you
what
the
old
weight
is
twelve
stone
six
would
i
take
that
weight
in
any
metal
for
the
old
girl
no
why
not
because
the
old
girl
metal
is
far
more
precious
than
the
preciousest
metal
and
she
all
metal
you
are
right
mat
when
she
took
me
and
accepted
of
the
ring
she
under
me
and
the
children
heart
and
head
for
life
she
that
earnest
says
bagnet
and
true
to
her
colours
that
touch
us
with
a
finger
and
she
turns
out
and
stands
to
her
arms
if
the
old
girl
fires
wide
once
in
a
way
at
the
call
of
duty
look
over
it
george
for
she
loyal
why
bless
her
mat
returns
the
trooper
i
think
the
higher
of
her
for
it
you
are
right
says
bagnet
with
the
warmest
enthusiasm
though
without
relaxing
the
rigidity
of
a
single
muscle
think
as
high
of
the
old
girl
as
the
rock
of
gibraltar
and
still
you
be
thinking
low
of
such
merits
but
i
never
own
to
it
before
her
discipline
must
be
maintained
these
encomiums
bring
them
to
mount
pleasant
and
to
grandfather
smallweed
house
the
door
is
opened
by
the
perennial
judy
who
having
surveyed
them
from
top
to
toe
with
no
particular
favour
but
indeed
with
a
malignant
sneer
leaves
them
standing
there
while
she
consults
the
oracle
as
to
their
admission
the
oracle
may
be
inferred
to
give
consent
from
the
circumstance
of
her
returning
with
the
words
on
her
honey
lips
that
they
can
come
in
if
they
want
to
it
thus
privileged
they
come
in
and
find
smallweed
with
his
feet
in
the
drawer
of
his
chair
as
if
it
were
a
paper
and
smallweed
obscured
with
the
cushion
like
a
bird
that
is
not
to
sing
my
dear
friend
says
grandfather
smallweed
with
those
two
lean
affectionate
arms
of
his
stretched
forth
how
de
do
how
de
do
who
is
our
friend
my
dear
friend
why
this
returns
george
not
able
to
be
very
conciliatory
at
first
is
matthew
bagnet
who
has
obliged
me
in
that
matter
of
ours
you
know
oh
bagnet
surely
the
old
man
looks
at
him
under
his
hand
hope
you
well
bagnet
fine
man
george
military
air
sir
no
chairs
being
offered
george
brings
one
forward
for
bagnet
and
one
for
himself
they
sit
down
bagnet
as
if
he
had
no
power
of
bending
himself
except
at
the
hips
for
that
purpose
judy
says
smallweed
bring
the
pipe
why
i
do
know
george
interposes
that
the
young
woman
need
give
herself
that
trouble
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
not
inclined
to
smoke
it
ai
you
returns
the
old
man
judy
bring
the
pipe
the
fact
is
smallweed
proceeds
george
that
i
find
myself
in
rather
an
unpleasant
state
of
mind
it
appears
to
me
sir
that
your
friend
in
the
city
has
been
playing
tricks
oh
dear
no
says
grandfather
smallweed
he
never
does
that
do
he
well
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
because
i
thought
it
might
be
his
doing
this
you
know
i
am
speaking
of
this
letter
grandfather
smallweed
smiles
in
a
very
ugly
way
in
recognition
of
the
letter
what
does
it
mean
asks
george
judy
says
the
old
man
have
you
got
the
pipe
give
it
to
me
did
you
say
what
does
it
mean
my
good
friend
aye
now
come
come
you
know
smallweed
urges
the
trooper
constraining
himself
to
speak
as
smoothly
and
confidentially
as
he
can
holding
the
open
letter
in
one
hand
and
resting
the
broad
knuckles
of
the
other
on
his
thigh
a
good
lot
of
money
has
passed
between
us
and
we
are
face
to
face
at
the
present
moment
and
are
both
well
aware
of
the
understanding
there
has
always
been
i
am
prepared
to
do
the
usual
thing
which
i
have
done
regularly
and
to
keep
this
matter
going
i
never
got
a
letter
like
this
from
you
before
and
i
have
been
a
little
put
about
by
it
this
morning
because
here
my
friend
matthew
bagnet
who
you
know
had
none
of
the
money
i
do
know
it
you
know
says
the
old
man
quietly
why
you
it
i
mean
i
tell
you
so
do
i
oh
yes
you
tell
me
so
returns
grandfather
smallweed
but
i
do
know
it
well
says
the
trooper
swallowing
his
fire
i
know
it
smallweed
replies
with
excellent
temper
ah
that
quite
another
thing
and
adds
but
it
do
matter
situation
is
all
one
whether
or
no
the
unfortunate
george
makes
a
great
effort
to
arrange
the
affair
comfortably
and
to
propitiate
smallweed
by
taking
him
upon
his
own
terms
that
just
what
i
mean
as
you
say
smallweed
here
matthew
bagnet
liable
to
be
fixed
whether
or
no
now
you
see
that
makes
his
good
lady
very
uneasy
in
her
mind
and
me
too
for
whereas
i
a
sort
of
a
that
more
kicks
than
halfpence
come
natural
to
why
he
a
steady
family
man
do
you
see
now
smallweed
says
the
trooper
gaining
confidence
as
he
proceeds
in
his
soldierly
mode
of
doing
business
although
you
and
i
are
good
friends
enough
in
a
certain
sort
of
a
way
i
am
well
aware
that
i
ca
ask
you
to
let
my
friend
bagnet
off
entirely
oh
dear
you
are
too
modest
you
can
ask
me
anything
mr
george
there
is
an
ogreish
kind
of
jocularity
in
grandfather
smallweed
and
you
can
refuse
you
mean
eh
or
not
you
so
much
perhaps
as
your
friend
in
the
city
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
echoes
grandfather
smallweed
in
such
a
very
hard
manner
and
with
eyes
so
particularly
green
that
bagnet
natural
gravity
is
much
deepened
by
the
contemplation
of
that
venerable
man
come
says
the
sanguine
george
i
am
glad
to
find
we
can
be
pleasant
because
i
want
to
arrange
this
pleasantly
here
my
friend
bagnet
and
here
am
i
we
settle
the
matter
on
the
spot
if
you
please
smallweed
in
the
usual
way
and
you
ease
my
friend
bagnet
mind
and
his
family
mind
a
good
deal
if
you
just
mention
to
him
what
our
understanding
is
here
some
shrill
spectre
cries
out
in
a
mocking
manner
oh
good
gracious
oh
unless
indeed
it
be
the
sportive
judy
who
is
found
to
be
silent
when
the
startled
visitors
look
round
but
whose
chin
has
received
a
recent
toss
expressive
of
derision
and
contempt
bagnet
gravity
becomes
yet
more
profound
but
i
think
you
asked
me
george
old
smallweed
who
all
this
time
has
had
the
pipe
in
his
hand
is
the
speaker
now
i
think
you
asked
me
what
did
the
letter
mean
why
yes
i
did
returns
the
trooper
in
his
way
but
i
do
care
to
know
particularly
if
it
all
correct
and
pleasant
smallweed
purposely
balking
himself
in
an
aim
at
the
head
throws
the
pipe
on
the
ground
and
breaks
it
to
pieces
that
what
it
means
my
dear
friend
i
smash
you
i
crumble
you
i
powder
you
go
to
the
devil
the
two
friends
rise
and
look
at
one
another
bagnet
gravity
has
now
attained
its
profoundest
point
go
to
the
devil
repeats
the
old
man
i
have
no
more
of
your
and
swaggerings
what
you
an
independent
dragoon
too
go
to
my
lawyer
you
remember
where
you
have
been
there
before
and
show
your
independence
now
will
you
come
my
dear
friend
there
a
chance
for
you
open
the
street
door
judy
put
these
blusterers
out
call
in
help
if
they
do
go
put
out
he
vociferates
this
so
loudly
that
bagnet
laying
his
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
his
comrade
before
the
latter
can
recover
from
his
amazement
gets
him
on
the
outside
of
the
street
door
which
is
instantly
slammed
by
the
triumphant
judy
utterly
confounded
george
awhile
stands
looking
at
the
knocker
bagnet
in
a
perfect
abyss
of
gravity
walks
up
and
down
before
the
little
parlour
window
like
a
sentry
and
looks
in
every
time
he
passes
apparently
revolving
something
in
his
mind
come
mat
says
george
when
he
has
recovered
himself
we
must
try
the
lawyer
now
what
do
you
think
of
this
rascal
bagnet
stopping
to
take
a
farewell
look
into
the
parlour
replies
with
one
shake
of
his
head
directed
at
the
interior
if
my
old
girl
had
been
here
i
have
told
him
having
so
discharged
himself
of
the
subject
of
his
cogitations
he
falls
into
step
and
marches
off
with
the
trooper
shoulder
to
shoulder
when
they
present
themselves
in
lincoln
inn
fields
tulkinghorn
is
engaged
and
not
to
be
seen
he
is
not
at
all
willing
to
see
them
for
when
they
have
waited
a
full
hour
and
the
clerk
on
his
bell
being
rung
takes
the
opportunity
of
mentioning
as
much
he
brings
forth
no
more
encouraging
message
than
that
tulkinghorn
has
nothing
to
say
to
them
and
they
had
better
not
wait
they
do
wait
however
with
the
perseverance
of
military
tactics
and
at
last
the
bell
rings
again
and
the
client
in
possession
comes
out
of
tulkinghorn
room
the
client
is
a
handsome
old
lady
no
other
than
rouncewell
housekeeper
at
chesney
wold
she
comes
out
of
the
sanctuary
with
a
fair
curtsy
and
softly
shuts
the
door
she
is
treated
with
some
distinction
there
for
the
clerk
steps
out
of
his
pew
to
show
her
through
the
outer
office
and
to
let
her
out
the
old
lady
is
thanking
him
for
his
attention
when
she
observes
the
comrades
in
waiting
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
think
those
gentlemen
are
military
the
clerk
referring
the
question
to
them
with
his
eye
and
george
not
turning
round
from
the
almanac
over
the
bagnet
takes
upon
himself
to
reply
yes
formerly
i
thought
so
i
was
sure
of
it
my
heart
warms
gentlemen
at
the
sight
of
you
it
always
does
at
the
sight
of
such
god
bless
you
gentlemen
you
excuse
an
old
woman
but
i
had
a
son
once
who
went
for
a
soldier
a
fine
handsome
youth
he
was
and
good
in
his
bold
way
though
some
people
did
disparage
him
to
his
poor
mother
i
ask
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
sir
god
bless
you
gentlemen
same
to
you
returns
bagnet
with
right
good
will
there
is
something
very
touching
in
the
earnestness
of
the
old
voice
and
in
the
tremble
that
goes
through
her
quaint
old
figure
but
george
is
so
occupied
with
the
almanac
over
the
calculating
the
coming
months
by
it
perhaps
that
he
does
not
look
round
until
she
has
gone
away
and
the
door
is
closed
upon
her
george
bagnet
gruffly
whispers
when
he
does
turn
from
the
almanac
at
last
do
be
cast
down
soldiers
why
should
we
be
melancholy
boys
cheer
up
my
hearty
the
clerk
having
now
again
gone
in
to
say
that
they
are
still
there
and
tulkinghorn
being
heard
to
return
with
some
irascibility
let
come
in
then
they
pass
into
the
great
room
with
the
painted
ceiling
and
find
him
standing
before
the
fire
now
you
men
what
do
you
want
sergeant
i
told
you
the
last
time
i
saw
you
that
i
do
desire
your
company
here
sergeant
replies
dashed
within
the
last
few
minutes
as
to
his
usual
manner
of
speech
and
even
as
to
his
usual
carriage
that
he
has
received
this
letter
has
been
to
smallweed
about
it
and
has
been
referred
there
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
rejoins
tulkinghorn
if
you
get
into
debt
you
must
pay
your
debts
or
take
the
consequences
you
have
no
occasion
to
come
here
to
learn
that
i
suppose
sergeant
is
sorry
to
say
that
he
is
not
prepared
with
the
money
very
well
then
the
other
man
this
man
if
this
is
he
must
pay
it
for
you
sergeant
is
sorry
to
add
that
the
other
man
is
not
prepared
with
the
money
either
very
well
then
you
must
pay
it
between
you
or
you
must
both
be
sued
for
it
and
both
suffer
you
have
had
the
money
and
must
refund
it
you
are
not
to
pocket
other
people
pounds
shillings
and
pence
and
escape
the
lawyer
sits
down
in
his
and
stirs
the
fire
george
hopes
he
will
have
the
goodness
to
i
tell
you
sergeant
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
i
do
like
your
associates
and
do
want
you
here
this
matter
is
not
at
all
in
my
course
of
practice
and
is
not
in
my
office
smallweed
is
good
enough
to
offer
these
affairs
to
me
but
they
are
not
in
my
way
you
must
go
to
melchisedech
in
clifford
inn
i
must
make
an
apology
to
you
sir
says
george
for
pressing
myself
upon
you
with
so
little
encouragement
which
is
almost
as
unpleasant
to
me
as
it
can
be
to
you
but
would
you
let
me
say
a
private
word
to
you
tulkinghorn
rises
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
walks
into
one
of
the
window
recesses
now
i
have
no
time
to
waste
in
the
midst
of
his
perfect
assumption
of
indifference
he
directs
a
sharp
look
at
the
trooper
taking
care
to
stand
with
his
own
back
to
the
light
and
to
have
the
other
with
his
face
towards
it
well
sir
says
george
this
man
with
me
is
the
other
party
implicated
in
this
unfortunate
affair
nominally
only
nominally
and
my
sole
object
is
to
prevent
his
getting
into
trouble
on
my
account
he
is
a
most
respectable
man
with
a
wife
and
family
formerly
in
the
royal
artillery
my
friend
i
do
care
a
pinch
of
snuff
for
the
whole
royal
artillery
establishment
officers
men
tumbrils
waggons
horses
guns
and
ammunition
is
likely
sir
but
i
care
a
good
deal
for
bagnet
and
his
wife
and
family
being
injured
on
my
account
and
if
i
could
bring
them
through
this
matter
i
should
have
no
help
for
it
but
to
give
up
without
any
other
consideration
what
you
wanted
of
me
the
other
day
have
you
got
it
here
i
have
got
it
here
sir
sergeant
the
lawyer
proceeds
in
his
dry
passionless
manner
far
more
hopeless
in
the
dealing
with
than
any
amount
of
vehemence
make
up
your
mind
while
i
speak
to
you
for
this
is
final
after
i
have
finished
speaking
i
have
closed
the
subject
and
i
wo
it
understand
that
you
can
leave
here
for
a
few
days
what
you
say
you
have
brought
here
if
you
choose
you
can
take
it
away
at
once
if
you
choose
in
case
you
choose
to
leave
it
here
i
can
do
this
for
you
i
can
replace
this
matter
on
its
old
footing
and
i
can
go
so
far
besides
as
to
give
you
a
written
undertaking
that
this
man
bagnet
shall
never
be
troubled
in
any
way
until
you
have
been
proceeded
against
to
the
utmost
that
your
means
shall
be
exhausted
before
the
creditor
looks
to
his
this
is
in
fact
all
but
freeing
him
have
you
decided
the
trooper
puts
his
hand
into
his
breast
and
answers
with
a
long
breath
i
must
do
it
sir
so
tulkinghorn
putting
on
his
spectacles
sits
down
and
writes
the
undertaking
which
he
slowly
reads
and
explains
to
bagnet
who
has
all
this
time
been
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
who
puts
his
hand
on
his
bald
head
again
under
this
new
verbal
and
seems
exceedingly
in
need
of
the
old
girl
through
whom
to
express
his
sentiments
the
trooper
then
takes
from
his
a
folded
paper
which
he
lays
with
an
unwilling
hand
at
the
lawyer
elbow
is
only
a
letter
of
instructions
sir
the
last
i
ever
had
from
him
look
at
a
millstone
george
for
some
change
in
its
expression
and
you
will
find
it
quite
as
soon
as
in
the
face
of
tulkinghorn
when
he
opens
and
reads
the
letter
he
refolds
it
and
lays
it
in
his
desk
with
a
countenance
as
unperturbable
as
death
nor
has
he
anything
more
to
say
or
do
but
to
nod
once
in
the
same
frigid
and
discourteous
manner
and
to
say
briefly
you
can
go
show
these
men
out
there
being
shown
out
they
repair
to
residence
to
dine
boiled
beef
and
greens
constitute
the
day
variety
on
the
former
repast
of
boiled
pork
and
greens
and
bagnet
serves
out
the
meal
in
the
same
way
and
seasons
it
with
the
best
of
temper
being
that
rare
sort
of
old
girl
that
she
receives
good
to
her
arms
without
a
hint
that
it
might
be
better
and
catches
light
from
any
little
spot
of
darkness
near
her
the
spot
on
this
occasion
is
the
darkened
brow
of
george
he
is
unusually
thoughtful
and
depressed
at
first
bagnet
trusts
to
the
combined
endearments
of
quebec
and
malta
to
restore
him
but
finding
those
young
ladies
sensible
that
their
existing
bluffy
is
not
the
bluffy
of
their
usual
frolicsome
acquaintance
she
winks
off
the
light
infantry
and
leaves
him
to
deploy
at
leisure
on
the
open
ground
of
the
domestic
hearth
but
he
does
not
he
remains
in
close
order
clouded
and
depressed
during
the
lengthy
cleaning
up
and
pattening
process
when
he
and
bagnet
are
supplied
with
their
pipes
he
is
no
better
than
he
was
at
dinner
he
forgets
to
smoke
looks
at
the
fire
and
ponders
lets
his
pipe
out
fills
the
breast
of
bagnet
with
perturbation
and
dismay
by
showing
that
he
has
no
enjoyment
of
tobacco
therefore
when
bagnet
at
last
appears
rosy
from
the
invigorating
pail
and
sits
down
to
her
work
bagnet
growls
old
girl
and
winks
monitions
to
her
to
find
out
what
the
matter
why
george
says
bagnet
quietly
threading
her
needle
how
low
you
are
am
i
not
good
company
well
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
he
ai
at
all
like
bluffy
mother
cries
little
malta
because
he
ai
well
i
think
mother
adds
quebec
sure
that
a
bad
sign
not
to
be
like
bluffy
too
returns
the
trooper
kissing
the
young
damsels
but
it
true
with
a
sigh
true
i
am
afraid
these
little
ones
are
always
right
george
says
bagnet
working
busily
if
i
thought
you
cross
enough
to
think
of
anything
that
a
shrill
old
soldier
wife
who
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
off
afterwards
and
ought
to
have
done
it
almost
said
this
morning
i
do
know
what
i
should
say
to
you
now
my
kind
soul
of
a
darling
returns
the
trooper
not
a
morsel
of
it
because
really
and
truly
george
what
i
said
and
meant
to
say
was
that
i
trusted
lignum
to
you
and
was
sure
you
bring
him
through
it
and
you
have
brought
him
through
it
noble
thankee
my
dear
says
george
i
am
glad
of
your
good
opinion
in
giving
bagnet
hand
with
her
work
in
it
a
friendly
shake
for
she
took
her
seat
beside
him
the
trooper
attention
is
attracted
to
her
face
after
looking
at
it
for
a
little
while
as
she
plies
her
needle
he
looks
to
young
woolwich
sitting
on
his
stool
in
the
corner
and
beckons
that
fifer
to
him
see
there
my
boy
says
george
very
gently
smoothing
the
hair
with
his
hand
there
a
good
loving
forehead
for
you
all
bright
with
love
of
you
my
boy
a
little
touched
by
the
sun
and
the
weather
through
following
your
father
about
and
taking
care
of
you
but
as
fresh
and
wholesome
as
a
ripe
apple
on
a
tree
bagnet
face
expresses
so
far
as
in
its
wooden
material
lies
the
highest
approbation
and
acquiescence
the
time
will
come
my
boy
pursues
the
trooper
when
this
hair
of
your
mother
will
be
grey
and
this
forehead
all
crossed
and
with
wrinkles
and
a
fine
old
lady
she
be
then
take
care
while
you
are
young
that
you
can
think
in
those
days
never
whitened
a
hair
of
her
dear
head
i
never
marked
a
sorrowful
line
in
her
face
for
of
all
the
many
things
that
you
can
think
of
when
you
are
a
man
you
had
better
have
that
by
you
woolwich
george
concludes
by
rising
from
his
chair
seating
the
boy
beside
his
mother
in
it
and
saying
with
something
of
a
hurry
about
him
that
he
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
street
a
bit
chapter
xxxv
esther
narrative
i
lay
ill
through
several
weeks
and
the
usual
tenor
of
my
life
became
like
an
old
remembrance
but
this
was
not
the
effect
of
time
so
much
as
of
the
change
in
all
my
habits
made
by
the
helplessness
and
inaction
of
a
before
i
had
been
confined
to
it
many
days
everything
else
seemed
to
have
retired
into
a
remote
distance
where
there
was
little
or
no
separation
between
the
various
stages
of
my
life
which
had
been
really
divided
by
years
in
falling
ill
i
seemed
to
have
crossed
a
dark
lake
and
to
have
left
all
my
experiences
mingled
together
by
the
great
distance
on
the
healthy
shore
my
housekeeping
duties
though
at
first
it
caused
me
great
anxiety
to
think
that
they
were
unperformed
were
soon
as
far
off
as
the
oldest
of
the
old
duties
at
greenleaf
or
the
summer
afternoons
when
i
went
home
from
school
with
my
portfolio
under
my
arm
and
my
childish
shadow
at
my
side
to
my
godmother
house
i
had
never
known
before
how
short
life
really
was
and
into
how
small
a
space
the
mind
could
put
it
while
i
was
very
ill
the
way
in
which
these
divisions
of
time
became
confused
with
one
another
distressed
my
mind
exceedingly
at
once
a
child
an
elder
girl
and
the
little
woman
i
had
been
so
happy
as
i
was
not
only
oppressed
by
cares
and
difficulties
adapted
to
each
station
but
by
the
great
perplexity
of
endlessly
trying
to
reconcile
them
i
suppose
that
few
who
have
not
been
in
such
a
condition
can
quite
understand
what
i
mean
or
what
painful
unrest
arose
from
this
source
for
the
same
reason
i
am
almost
afraid
to
hint
at
that
time
in
my
disorder
it
seemed
one
long
night
but
i
believe
there
were
both
nights
and
days
in
it
when
i
laboured
up
colossal
staircases
ever
striving
to
reach
the
top
and
ever
turned
as
i
have
seen
a
worm
in
a
garden
path
by
some
obstruction
and
labouring
again
i
knew
perfectly
at
intervals
and
i
think
vaguely
at
most
times
that
i
was
in
my
bed
and
i
talked
with
charley
and
felt
her
touch
and
knew
her
very
well
yet
i
would
find
myself
complaining
oh
more
of
these
stairs
charley
more
and
more
piled
up
to
the
sky
i
think
and
labouring
on
again
dare
i
hint
at
that
worse
time
when
strung
together
somewhere
in
great
black
space
there
was
a
flaming
necklace
or
ring
or
starry
circle
of
some
kind
of
which
i
was
one
of
the
beads
and
when
my
only
prayer
was
to
be
taken
off
from
the
rest
and
when
it
was
such
inexplicable
agony
and
misery
to
be
a
part
of
the
dreadful
thing
perhaps
the
less
i
say
of
these
sick
experiences
the
less
tedious
and
the
more
intelligible
i
shall
be
i
do
not
recall
them
to
make
others
unhappy
or
because
i
am
now
the
least
unhappy
in
remembering
them
it
may
be
that
if
we
knew
more
of
such
strange
afflictions
we
might
be
the
better
able
to
alleviate
their
intensity
the
repose
that
succeeded
the
long
delicious
sleep
the
blissful
rest
when
in
my
weakness
i
was
too
calm
to
have
any
care
for
myself
and
could
have
heard
or
so
i
think
now
that
i
was
dying
with
no
other
emotion
than
with
a
pitying
love
for
those
i
left
behind
this
state
can
be
perhaps
more
widely
understood
i
was
in
this
state
when
i
first
shrunk
from
the
light
as
it
twinkled
on
me
once
more
and
knew
with
a
boundless
joy
for
which
no
words
are
rapturous
enough
that
i
should
see
again
i
had
heard
my
ada
crying
at
the
door
day
and
night
i
had
heard
her
calling
to
me
that
i
was
cruel
and
did
not
love
her
i
had
heard
her
praying
and
imploring
to
be
let
in
to
nurse
and
comfort
me
and
to
leave
my
bedside
no
more
but
i
had
only
said
when
i
could
speak
never
my
sweet
girl
never
and
i
had
over
and
over
again
reminded
charley
that
she
was
to
keep
my
darling
from
the
room
whether
i
lived
or
died
charley
had
been
true
to
me
in
that
time
of
need
and
with
her
little
hand
and
her
great
heart
had
kept
the
door
fast
but
now
my
sight
strengthening
and
the
glorious
light
coming
every
day
more
fully
and
brightly
on
me
i
could
read
the
letters
that
my
dear
wrote
to
me
every
morning
and
evening
and
could
put
them
to
my
lips
and
lay
my
cheek
upon
them
with
no
fear
of
hurting
her
i
could
see
my
little
maid
so
tender
and
so
careful
going
about
the
two
rooms
setting
everything
in
order
and
speaking
cheerfully
to
ada
from
the
open
window
again
i
could
understand
the
stillness
in
the
house
and
the
thoughtfulness
it
expressed
on
the
part
of
all
those
who
had
always
been
so
good
to
me
i
could
weep
in
the
exquisite
felicity
of
my
heart
and
be
as
happy
in
my
weakness
as
ever
i
had
been
in
my
strength
by
and
by
my
strength
began
to
be
restored
instead
of
lying
with
so
strange
a
calmness
watching
what
was
done
for
me
as
if
it
were
done
for
some
one
else
whom
i
was
quietly
sorry
for
i
helped
it
a
little
and
so
on
to
a
little
more
and
much
more
until
i
became
useful
to
myself
and
interested
and
attached
to
life
again
how
well
i
remember
the
pleasant
afternoon
when
i
was
raised
in
bed
with
pillows
for
the
first
time
to
enjoy
a
great
with
charley
the
little
creature
sent
into
the
world
surely
to
minister
to
the
weak
and
sick
was
so
happy
and
so
busy
and
stopped
so
often
in
her
preparations
to
lay
her
head
upon
my
bosom
and
fondle
me
and
cry
with
joyful
tears
she
was
so
glad
she
was
so
glad
that
i
was
obliged
to
say
charley
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
i
must
lie
down
again
my
darling
for
i
am
weaker
than
i
thought
i
was
so
charley
became
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
took
her
bright
face
here
and
there
across
and
across
the
two
rooms
out
of
the
shade
into
the
divine
sunshine
and
out
of
the
sunshine
into
the
shade
while
i
watched
her
peacefully
when
all
her
preparations
were
concluded
and
the
pretty
with
its
little
delicacies
to
tempt
me
and
its
white
cloth
and
its
flowers
and
everything
so
lovingly
and
beautifully
arranged
for
me
by
ada
downstairs
was
ready
at
the
bedside
i
felt
sure
i
was
steady
enough
to
say
something
to
charley
that
was
not
new
to
my
thoughts
first
i
complimented
charley
on
the
room
and
indeed
it
was
so
fresh
and
airy
so
spotless
and
neat
that
i
could
scarce
believe
i
had
been
lying
there
so
long
this
delighted
charley
and
her
face
was
brighter
than
before
yet
charley
said
i
looking
round
i
miss
something
surely
that
i
am
accustomed
to
poor
little
charley
looked
round
too
and
pretended
to
shake
her
head
as
if
there
were
nothing
absent
are
the
pictures
all
as
they
used
to
be
i
asked
her
every
one
of
them
miss
said
charley
and
the
furniture
charley
except
where
i
have
moved
it
about
to
make
more
room
miss
and
yet
said
i
i
miss
some
familiar
object
ah
i
know
what
it
is
charley
it
the
charley
got
up
from
the
table
making
as
if
she
had
forgotten
something
and
went
into
the
next
room
and
i
heard
her
sob
there
i
had
thought
of
this
very
often
i
was
now
certain
of
it
i
could
thank
god
that
it
was
not
a
shock
to
me
now
i
called
charley
back
and
when
she
came
at
first
pretending
to
smile
but
as
she
drew
nearer
to
me
looking
grieved
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
said
it
matters
very
little
charley
i
hope
i
can
do
without
my
old
face
very
well
i
was
presently
so
far
advanced
as
to
be
able
to
sit
up
in
a
great
chair
and
even
giddily
to
walk
into
the
adjoining
room
leaning
on
charley
the
mirror
was
gone
from
its
usual
place
in
that
room
too
but
what
i
had
to
bear
was
none
the
harder
to
bear
for
that
my
guardian
had
throughout
been
earnest
to
visit
me
and
there
was
now
no
good
reason
why
i
should
deny
myself
that
happiness
he
came
one
morning
and
when
he
first
came
in
could
only
hold
me
in
his
embrace
and
say
my
dear
dear
girl
i
had
long
known
who
could
know
better
what
a
deep
fountain
of
affection
and
generosity
his
heart
was
and
was
it
not
worth
my
trivial
suffering
and
change
to
fill
such
a
place
in
it
oh
yes
i
thought
he
has
seen
me
and
he
loves
me
better
than
he
did
he
has
seen
me
and
is
even
fonder
of
me
than
he
was
before
and
what
have
i
to
mourn
for
he
sat
down
by
me
on
the
sofa
supporting
me
with
his
arm
for
a
little
while
he
sat
with
his
hand
over
his
face
but
when
he
removed
it
fell
into
his
usual
manner
there
never
can
have
been
there
never
can
be
a
pleasanter
manner
my
little
woman
said
he
what
a
sad
time
this
has
been
such
an
inflexible
little
woman
too
through
all
only
for
the
best
guardian
said
i
for
the
best
he
repeated
tenderly
of
course
for
the
best
but
here
have
ada
and
i
been
perfectly
forlorn
and
miserable
here
has
your
friend
caddy
been
coming
and
going
late
and
early
here
has
every
one
about
the
house
been
utterly
lost
and
dejected
here
has
even
poor
rick
been
writing
to
me
too
in
his
anxiety
for
you
i
had
read
of
caddy
in
ada
letters
but
not
of
richard
i
told
him
so
why
no
my
dear
he
replied
i
have
thought
it
better
not
to
mention
it
to
her
and
you
speak
of
his
writing
to
you
said
i
repeating
his
emphasis
as
if
it
were
not
natural
for
him
to
do
so
guardian
as
if
he
could
write
to
a
better
friend
he
thinks
he
could
my
love
returned
my
guardian
and
to
many
a
better
the
truth
is
he
wrote
to
me
under
a
sort
of
protest
while
unable
to
write
to
you
with
any
hope
of
an
answer
wrote
coldly
haughtily
distantly
resentfully
well
dearest
little
woman
we
must
look
forbearingly
on
it
he
is
not
to
blame
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
has
warped
him
out
of
himself
and
perverted
me
in
his
eyes
i
have
known
it
do
as
bad
deeds
and
worse
many
a
time
if
two
angels
could
be
concerned
in
it
i
believe
it
would
change
their
nature
it
has
not
changed
yours
guardian
oh
yes
it
has
my
dear
he
said
laughingly
it
has
made
the
south
wind
easterly
i
do
know
how
often
rick
mistrusts
and
suspects
me
goes
to
lawyers
and
is
taught
to
mistrust
and
suspect
me
hears
i
have
conflicting
interests
claims
clashing
against
his
and
what
not
whereas
heaven
knows
that
if
i
could
get
out
of
the
mountains
of
wiglomeration
on
which
my
unfortunate
name
has
been
so
long
bestowed
which
i
ca
or
could
level
them
by
the
extinction
of
my
own
original
right
which
i
ca
either
and
no
human
power
ever
can
anyhow
i
believe
to
such
a
pass
have
we
got
i
would
do
it
this
hour
i
would
rather
restore
to
poor
rick
his
proper
nature
than
be
endowed
with
all
the
money
that
dead
suitors
broken
heart
and
soul
upon
the
wheel
of
chancery
have
left
unclaimed
with
the
and
that
money
enough
my
dear
to
be
cast
into
a
pyramid
in
memory
of
chancery
transcendent
wickedness
is
it
possible
guardian
i
asked
amazed
that
richard
can
be
suspicious
of
you
ah
my
love
my
love
he
said
it
is
in
the
subtle
poison
of
such
abuses
to
breed
such
diseases
his
blood
is
infected
and
objects
lose
their
natural
aspects
in
his
sight
it
is
not
his
fault
but
it
is
a
terrible
misfortune
guardian
it
is
a
terrible
misfortune
little
woman
to
be
ever
drawn
within
the
influences
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
i
know
none
greater
by
little
and
little
he
has
been
induced
to
trust
in
that
rotten
reed
and
it
communicates
some
portion
of
its
rottenness
to
everything
around
him
but
again
i
say
with
all
my
soul
we
must
be
patient
with
poor
rick
and
not
blame
him
what
a
troop
of
fine
fresh
hearts
like
his
have
i
seen
in
my
time
turned
by
the
same
means
i
could
not
help
expressing
something
of
my
wonder
and
regret
that
his
benevolent
disinterested
intentions
had
prospered
so
little
we
must
not
say
so
dame
durden
he
cheerfully
replied
ada
is
the
happier
i
hope
and
that
is
much
i
did
think
that
i
and
both
these
young
creatures
might
be
friends
instead
of
distrustful
foes
and
that
we
might
so
far
the
suit
and
prove
too
strong
for
it
but
it
was
too
much
to
expect
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
was
the
curtain
of
rick
cradle
but
guardian
may
we
not
hope
that
a
little
experience
will
teach
him
what
a
false
and
wretched
thing
it
is
we
will
hope
so
my
esther
said
jarndyce
and
that
it
may
not
teach
him
so
too
late
in
any
case
we
must
not
be
hard
on
him
there
are
not
many
grown
and
matured
men
living
while
we
speak
good
men
too
who
if
they
were
thrown
into
this
same
court
as
suitors
would
not
be
vitally
changed
and
depreciated
within
three
years
within
two
within
one
how
can
we
stand
amazed
at
poor
rick
a
young
man
so
unfortunate
here
he
fell
into
a
lower
tone
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
can
not
at
first
believe
who
could
that
chancery
is
what
it
is
he
looks
to
it
flushed
and
fitfully
to
do
something
with
his
interests
and
bring
them
to
some
settlement
it
procrastinates
disappoints
tries
tortures
him
wears
out
his
sanguine
hopes
and
patience
thread
by
thread
but
he
still
looks
to
it
and
hankers
after
it
and
finds
his
whole
world
treacherous
and
hollow
well
well
well
enough
of
this
my
dear
he
had
supported
me
as
at
first
all
this
time
and
his
tenderness
was
so
precious
to
me
that
i
leaned
my
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
loved
him
as
if
he
had
been
my
father
i
resolved
in
my
own
mind
in
this
little
pause
by
some
means
to
see
richard
when
i
grew
strong
and
try
to
set
him
right
there
are
better
subjects
than
these
said
my
guardian
for
such
a
joyful
time
as
the
time
of
our
dear
girl
recovery
and
i
had
a
commission
to
broach
one
of
them
as
soon
as
i
should
begin
to
talk
when
shall
ada
come
to
see
you
my
love
i
had
been
thinking
of
that
too
a
little
in
connexion
with
the
absent
mirrors
but
not
much
for
i
knew
my
loving
girl
would
be
changed
by
no
change
in
my
looks
dear
guardian
said
i
as
i
have
shut
her
out
so
long
though
indeed
indeed
she
is
like
the
light
to
me
i
know
it
well
dame
durden
well
he
was
so
good
his
touch
expressed
such
endearing
compassion
and
affection
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
carried
such
comfort
into
my
heart
that
i
stopped
for
a
little
while
quite
unable
to
go
on
yes
yes
you
are
tired
said
he
rest
a
little
as
i
have
kept
ada
out
so
long
i
began
afresh
after
a
short
while
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
my
own
way
a
little
longer
guardian
it
would
be
best
to
be
away
from
here
before
i
see
her
if
charley
and
i
were
to
go
to
some
country
lodging
as
soon
as
i
can
move
and
if
i
had
a
week
there
in
which
to
grow
stronger
and
to
be
revived
by
the
sweet
air
and
to
look
forward
to
the
happiness
of
having
ada
with
me
again
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
us
i
hope
it
was
not
a
poor
thing
in
me
to
wish
to
be
a
little
more
used
to
my
altered
self
before
i
met
the
eyes
of
the
dear
girl
i
longed
so
ardently
to
see
but
it
is
the
truth
i
did
he
understood
me
i
was
sure
but
i
was
not
afraid
of
that
if
it
were
a
poor
thing
i
knew
he
would
pass
it
over
our
spoilt
little
woman
said
my
guardian
shall
have
her
own
way
even
in
her
inflexibility
though
at
the
price
i
know
of
tears
downstairs
and
see
here
here
is
boythorn
heart
of
chivalry
breathing
such
ferocious
vows
as
never
were
breathed
on
paper
before
that
if
you
do
go
and
occupy
his
whole
house
he
having
already
turned
out
of
it
expressly
for
that
purpose
by
heaven
and
by
earth
he
pull
it
down
and
not
leave
one
brick
standing
on
another
and
my
guardian
put
a
letter
in
my
hand
without
any
ordinary
beginning
such
as
my
dear
jarndyce
but
rushing
at
once
into
the
words
i
swear
if
miss
summerson
do
not
come
down
and
take
possession
of
my
house
which
i
vacate
for
her
this
day
at
one
and
then
with
the
utmost
seriousness
and
in
the
most
emphatic
terms
going
on
to
make
the
extraordinary
declaration
he
had
quoted
we
did
not
appreciate
the
writer
the
less
for
laughing
heartily
over
it
and
we
settled
that
i
should
send
him
a
letter
of
thanks
on
the
morrow
and
accept
his
offer
it
was
a
most
agreeable
one
to
me
for
all
the
places
i
could
have
thought
of
i
should
have
liked
to
go
to
none
so
well
as
chesney
wold
now
little
housewife
said
my
guardian
looking
at
his
watch
i
was
strictly
timed
before
i
came
upstairs
for
you
must
not
be
tired
too
soon
and
my
time
has
waned
away
to
the
last
minute
i
have
one
other
petition
little
miss
flite
hearing
a
rumour
that
you
were
ill
made
nothing
of
walking
down
here
twenty
miles
poor
soul
in
a
pair
of
dancing
shoes
to
inquire
it
was
heaven
mercy
we
were
at
home
or
she
would
have
walked
back
again
the
old
conspiracy
to
make
me
happy
everybody
seemed
to
be
in
it
now
pet
said
my
guardian
if
it
would
not
be
irksome
to
you
to
admit
the
harmless
little
creature
one
afternoon
before
you
save
boythorn
otherwise
devoted
house
from
demolition
i
believe
you
would
make
her
prouder
and
better
pleased
with
herself
than
i
though
my
eminent
name
is
jarndyce
could
do
in
a
lifetime
i
have
no
doubt
he
knew
there
would
be
something
in
the
simple
image
of
the
poor
afflicted
creature
that
would
fall
like
a
gentle
lesson
on
my
mind
at
that
time
i
felt
it
as
he
spoke
to
me
i
could
not
tell
him
heartily
enough
how
ready
i
was
to
receive
her
i
had
always
pitied
her
never
so
much
as
now
i
had
always
been
glad
of
my
little
power
to
soothe
her
under
her
calamity
but
never
never
half
so
glad
before
we
arranged
a
time
for
miss
flite
to
come
out
by
the
coach
and
share
my
early
dinner
when
my
guardian
left
me
i
turned
my
face
away
upon
my
couch
and
prayed
to
be
forgiven
if
i
surrounded
by
such
blessings
had
magnified
to
myself
the
little
trial
that
i
had
to
undergo
the
childish
prayer
of
that
old
birthday
when
i
had
aspired
to
be
industrious
contented
and
and
to
do
good
to
some
one
and
win
some
love
to
myself
if
i
could
came
back
into
my
mind
with
a
reproachful
sense
of
all
the
happiness
i
had
since
enjoyed
and
all
the
affectionate
hearts
that
had
been
turned
towards
me
if
i
were
weak
now
what
had
i
profited
by
those
mercies
i
repeated
the
old
childish
prayer
in
its
old
childish
words
and
found
that
its
old
peace
had
not
departed
from
it
my
guardian
now
came
every
day
in
a
week
or
so
more
i
could
walk
about
our
rooms
and
hold
long
talks
with
ada
from
behind
the
yet
i
never
saw
her
for
i
had
not
as
yet
the
courage
to
look
at
the
dear
face
though
i
could
have
done
so
easily
without
her
seeing
me
on
the
appointed
day
miss
flite
arrived
the
poor
little
creature
ran
into
my
room
quite
forgetful
of
her
usual
dignity
and
crying
from
her
very
heart
of
hearts
my
dear
fitz
jarndyce
fell
upon
my
neck
and
kissed
me
twenty
times
dear
me
said
she
putting
her
hand
into
her
reticule
i
have
nothing
here
but
documents
my
dear
fitz
jarndyce
i
must
borrow
a
pocket
handkerchief
charley
gave
her
one
and
the
good
creature
certainly
made
use
of
it
for
she
held
it
to
her
eyes
with
both
hands
and
sat
so
shedding
tears
for
the
next
ten
minutes
with
pleasure
my
dear
fitz
jarndyce
she
was
careful
to
explain
not
the
least
pain
pleasure
to
see
you
well
again
pleasure
at
having
the
honour
of
being
admitted
to
see
you
i
am
so
much
fonder
of
you
my
love
than
of
the
chancellor
though
i
do
attend
court
regularly
by
the
by
my
dear
mentioning
pocket
handkerchiefs
miss
flite
here
looked
at
charley
who
had
been
to
meet
her
at
the
place
where
the
coach
stopped
charley
glanced
at
me
and
looked
unwilling
to
pursue
the
suggestion
right
said
miss
flite
correct
truly
highly
indiscreet
of
me
to
mention
it
but
my
dear
miss
fitz
jarndyce
i
am
afraid
i
am
at
times
between
ourselves
you
would
think
it
a
little
rambling
you
know
said
miss
flite
touching
her
forehead
nothing
more
what
were
you
going
to
tell
me
said
i
smiling
for
i
saw
she
wanted
to
go
on
you
have
roused
my
curiosity
and
now
you
must
gratify
it
miss
flite
looked
at
charley
for
advice
in
this
important
crisis
who
said
if
you
please
you
had
better
tell
then
and
therein
gratified
miss
flite
beyond
measure
so
sagacious
our
young
friend
said
she
to
me
in
her
mysterious
way
diminutive
but
sagacious
well
my
dear
it
a
pretty
anecdote
nothing
more
still
i
think
it
charming
who
should
follow
us
down
the
road
from
the
coach
my
dear
but
a
poor
person
in
a
very
ungenteel
bonnet
jenny
if
you
please
miss
said
charley
just
so
miss
flite
acquiesced
with
the
greatest
suavity
jenny
and
what
does
she
tell
our
young
friend
but
that
there
has
been
a
lady
with
a
veil
inquiring
at
her
cottage
after
my
dear
fitz
jarndyce
health
and
taking
a
handkerchief
away
with
her
as
a
little
keepsake
merely
because
it
was
my
amiable
fitz
jarndyce
now
you
know
so
very
prepossessing
in
the
lady
with
the
veil
if
you
please
miss
said
charley
to
whom
i
looked
in
some
astonishment
jenny
says
that
when
her
baby
died
you
left
a
handkerchief
there
and
that
she
put
it
away
and
kept
it
with
the
baby
little
things
i
think
if
you
please
partly
because
it
was
yours
miss
and
partly
because
it
had
covered
the
baby
diminutive
whispered
miss
flite
making
a
variety
of
motions
about
her
own
forehead
to
express
intellect
in
charley
but
exceedingly
sagacious
and
so
dear
my
love
she
clearer
than
any
counsel
i
ever
heard
yes
charley
i
returned
i
remember
it
well
well
miss
said
charley
and
that
the
handkerchief
the
lady
took
and
jenny
wants
you
to
know
that
she
would
have
made
away
with
it
herself
for
a
heap
of
money
but
that
the
lady
took
it
and
left
some
money
instead
jenny
do
know
her
at
all
if
you
please
miss
why
who
can
she
be
said
i
my
love
miss
flite
suggested
advancing
her
lips
to
my
ear
with
her
most
mysterious
look
in
my
opinion
do
mention
this
to
our
diminutive
friend
she
the
lord
chancellor
wife
he
married
you
know
and
i
understand
she
leads
him
a
terrible
life
throws
his
lordship
papers
into
the
fire
my
dear
if
he
wo
pay
the
jeweller
i
did
not
think
very
much
about
this
lady
then
for
i
had
an
impression
that
it
might
be
caddy
besides
my
attention
was
diverted
by
my
visitor
who
was
cold
after
her
ride
and
looked
hungry
and
who
our
dinner
being
brought
in
required
some
little
assistance
in
arraying
herself
with
great
satisfaction
in
a
pitiable
old
scarf
and
a
and
pair
of
gloves
which
she
had
brought
down
in
a
paper
parcel
i
had
to
preside
too
over
the
entertainment
consisting
of
a
dish
of
fish
a
roast
fowl
a
sweetbread
vegetables
pudding
and
madeira
and
it
was
so
pleasant
to
see
how
she
enjoyed
it
and
with
what
state
and
ceremony
she
did
honour
to
it
that
i
was
soon
thinking
of
nothing
else
when
we
had
finished
and
had
our
little
dessert
before
us
embellished
by
the
hands
of
my
dear
who
would
yield
the
superintendence
of
everything
prepared
for
me
to
no
one
miss
flite
was
so
very
chatty
and
happy
that
i
thought
i
would
lead
her
to
her
own
history
as
she
was
always
pleased
to
talk
about
herself
i
began
by
saying
you
have
attended
on
the
lord
chancellor
many
years
miss
flite
oh
many
many
many
years
my
dear
but
i
expect
a
judgment
shortly
there
was
an
anxiety
even
in
her
hopefulness
that
made
me
doubtful
if
i
had
done
right
in
approaching
the
subject
i
thought
i
would
say
no
more
about
it
my
father
expected
a
judgment
said
miss
flite
my
brother
my
sister
they
all
expected
a
judgment
the
same
that
i
expect
they
are
all
dead
of
course
my
dear
said
she
as
i
saw
she
would
go
on
i
thought
it
best
to
try
to
be
serviceable
to
her
by
meeting
the
theme
rather
than
avoiding
it
would
it
not
be
wiser
said
i
to
expect
this
judgment
no
more
why
my
dear
she
answered
promptly
of
course
it
would
and
to
attend
the
court
no
more
equally
of
course
said
she
very
wearing
to
be
always
in
expectation
of
what
never
comes
my
dear
fitz
jarndyce
wearing
i
assure
you
to
the
bone
she
slightly
showed
me
her
arm
and
it
was
fearfully
thin
indeed
but
my
dear
she
went
on
in
her
mysterious
way
there
a
dreadful
attraction
in
the
place
hush
do
mention
it
to
our
diminutive
friend
when
she
comes
in
or
it
may
frighten
her
with
good
reason
there
a
cruel
attraction
in
the
place
you
ca
leave
it
and
you
must
expect
i
tried
to
assure
her
that
this
was
not
so
she
heard
me
patiently
and
smilingly
but
was
ready
with
her
own
answer
aye
aye
aye
you
think
so
because
i
am
a
little
rambling
absurd
to
be
a
little
rambling
is
it
not
confusing
too
to
the
head
i
find
it
so
but
my
dear
i
have
been
there
many
years
and
i
have
noticed
it
the
mace
and
seal
upon
the
table
what
could
they
do
did
she
think
i
mildly
asked
her
draw
returned
miss
flite
draw
people
on
my
dear
draw
peace
out
of
them
sense
out
of
them
good
looks
out
of
them
good
qualities
out
of
them
i
have
felt
them
even
drawing
my
rest
away
in
the
night
cold
and
glittering
devils
she
tapped
me
several
times
upon
the
arm
and
nodded
as
if
she
were
anxious
i
should
understand
that
i
had
no
cause
to
fear
her
though
she
spoke
so
gloomily
and
confided
these
awful
secrets
to
me
let
me
see
said
she
i
tell
you
my
own
case
before
they
ever
drew
me
before
i
had
ever
seen
them
what
was
it
i
used
to
do
tambourine
playing
no
tambour
work
i
and
my
sister
worked
at
tambour
work
our
father
and
our
brother
had
a
builder
business
we
all
lived
together
respectably
my
dear
first
our
father
was
drawn
slowly
home
was
drawn
with
him
in
a
few
years
he
was
a
fierce
sour
angry
bankrupt
without
a
kind
word
or
a
kind
look
for
any
one
he
had
been
so
different
fitz
jarndyce
he
was
drawn
to
a
debtors
prison
there
he
died
then
our
brother
was
drawn
swiftly
to
drunkenness
and
rags
and
death
then
my
sister
was
drawn
hush
never
ask
to
what
then
i
was
ill
and
in
misery
and
heard
as
i
had
often
heard
before
that
this
was
all
the
work
of
chancery
when
i
got
better
i
went
to
look
at
the
monster
and
then
i
found
out
how
it
was
and
i
was
drawn
to
stay
there
having
got
over
her
own
short
narrative
in
the
delivery
of
which
she
had
spoken
in
a
low
strained
voice
as
if
the
shock
were
fresh
upon
her
she
gradually
resumed
her
usual
air
of
amiable
importance
you
do
quite
credit
me
my
dear
well
well
you
will
some
day
i
am
a
little
rambling
but
i
have
noticed
i
have
seen
many
new
faces
come
unsuspicious
within
the
influence
of
the
mace
and
seal
in
these
many
years
as
my
father
came
there
as
my
brother
as
my
sister
as
my
own
i
hear
conversation
kenge
and
the
rest
of
them
say
to
the
new
faces
little
miss
flite
oh
you
are
new
here
and
you
must
come
and
be
presented
to
little
miss
flite
good
proud
i
am
sure
to
have
the
honour
and
we
all
laugh
but
fitz
jarndyce
i
know
what
will
happen
i
know
far
better
than
they
do
when
the
attraction
has
begun
i
know
the
signs
my
dear
i
saw
them
begin
in
gridley
and
i
saw
them
end
fitz
jarndyce
my
love
speaking
low
again
i
saw
them
beginning
in
our
friend
the
ward
in
jarndyce
let
some
one
hold
him
back
or
he
be
drawn
to
ruin
she
looked
at
me
in
silence
for
some
moments
with
her
face
gradually
softening
into
a
smile
seeming
to
fear
that
she
had
been
too
gloomy
and
seeming
also
to
lose
the
connexion
in
her
mind
she
said
politely
as
she
sipped
her
glass
of
wine
yes
my
dear
as
i
was
saying
i
expect
a
judgment
shortly
then
i
shall
release
my
birds
you
know
and
confer
estates
i
was
much
impressed
by
her
allusion
to
richard
and
by
the
sad
meaning
so
sadly
illustrated
in
her
poor
pinched
form
that
made
its
way
through
all
her
incoherence
but
happily
for
her
she
was
quite
complacent
again
now
and
beamed
with
nods
and
smiles
but
my
dear
she
said
gaily
reaching
another
hand
to
put
it
upon
mine
you
have
not
congratulated
me
on
my
physician
positively
not
once
yet
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
i
did
not
quite
know
what
she
meant
my
physician
woodcourt
my
dear
who
was
so
exceedingly
attentive
to
me
though
his
services
were
rendered
quite
gratuitously
until
the
day
of
judgment
i
mean
the
judgment
that
will
dissolve
the
spell
upon
me
of
the
mace
and
seal
woodcourt
is
so
far
away
now
said
i
that
i
thought
the
time
for
such
congratulation
was
past
miss
flite
but
my
child
she
returned
is
it
possible
that
you
do
know
what
has
happened
no
said
i
not
what
everybody
has
been
talking
of
my
beloved
fitz
jarndyce
no
said
i
you
forget
how
long
i
have
been
here
true
my
dear
for
the
moment
true
i
blame
myself
but
my
memory
has
been
drawn
out
of
me
with
everything
else
by
what
i
mentioned
strong
influence
is
it
not
well
my
dear
there
has
been
a
terrible
shipwreck
over
in
those
east
indian
seas
woodcourt
shipwrecked
do
be
agitated
my
dear
he
is
safe
an
awful
scene
death
in
all
shapes
hundreds
of
dead
and
dying
fire
storm
and
darkness
numbers
of
the
drowning
thrown
upon
a
rock
there
and
through
it
all
my
dear
physician
was
a
hero
calm
and
brave
through
everything
saved
many
lives
never
complained
in
hunger
and
thirst
wrapped
naked
people
in
his
spare
clothes
took
the
lead
showed
them
what
to
do
governed
them
tended
the
sick
buried
the
dead
and
brought
the
poor
survivors
safely
off
at
last
my
dear
the
poor
emaciated
creatures
all
but
worshipped
him
they
fell
down
at
his
feet
when
they
got
to
the
land
and
blessed
him
the
whole
country
rings
with
it
stay
where
my
bag
of
documents
i
have
got
it
there
and
you
shall
read
it
you
shall
read
it
and
i
did
read
all
the
noble
history
though
very
slowly
and
imperfectly
then
for
my
eyes
were
so
dimmed
that
i
could
not
see
the
words
and
i
cried
so
much
that
i
was
many
times
obliged
to
lay
down
the
long
account
she
had
cut
out
of
the
newspaper
i
felt
so
triumphant
ever
to
have
known
the
man
who
had
done
such
generous
and
gallant
deeds
i
felt
such
glowing
exultation
in
his
renown
i
so
admired
and
loved
what
he
had
done
that
i
envied
the
people
who
had
fallen
at
his
feet
and
blessed
him
as
their
preserver
i
could
myself
have
kneeled
down
then
so
far
away
and
blessed
him
in
my
rapture
that
he
should
be
so
truly
good
and
brave
i
felt
that
no
one
mother
sister
wife
could
honour
him
more
than
i
did
indeed
my
poor
little
visitor
made
me
a
present
of
the
account
and
when
as
the
evening
began
to
close
in
she
rose
to
take
her
leave
lest
she
should
miss
the
coach
by
which
she
was
to
return
she
was
still
full
of
the
shipwreck
which
i
had
not
yet
sufficiently
composed
myself
to
understand
in
all
its
details
my
dear
said
she
as
she
carefully
folded
up
her
scarf
and
gloves
my
brave
physician
ought
to
have
a
title
bestowed
upon
him
and
no
doubt
he
will
you
are
of
that
opinion
that
he
well
deserved
one
yes
that
he
would
ever
have
one
no
why
not
fitz
jarndyce
she
asked
rather
sharply
i
said
it
was
not
the
custom
in
england
to
confer
titles
on
men
distinguished
by
peaceful
services
however
good
and
great
unless
occasionally
when
they
consisted
of
the
accumulation
of
some
very
large
amount
of
money
why
good
gracious
said
miss
flite
how
can
you
say
that
surely
you
know
my
dear
that
all
the
greatest
ornaments
of
england
in
knowledge
imagination
active
humanity
and
improvement
of
every
sort
are
added
to
its
nobility
look
round
you
my
dear
and
consider
you
must
be
rambling
a
little
now
i
think
if
you
know
that
this
is
the
great
reason
why
titles
will
always
last
in
the
land
i
am
afraid
she
believed
what
she
said
for
there
were
moments
when
she
was
very
mad
indeed
and
now
i
must
part
with
the
little
secret
i
have
thus
far
tried
to
keep
i
had
thought
sometimes
that
woodcourt
loved
me
and
that
if
he
had
been
richer
he
would
perhaps
have
told
me
that
he
loved
me
before
he
went
away
i
had
thought
sometimes
that
if
he
had
done
so
i
should
have
been
glad
of
it
but
how
much
better
it
was
now
that
this
had
never
happened
what
should
i
have
suffered
if
i
had
had
to
write
to
him
and
tell
him
that
the
poor
face
he
had
known
as
mine
was
quite
gone
from
me
and
that
i
freely
released
him
from
his
bondage
to
one
whom
he
had
never
seen
oh
it
was
so
much
better
as
it
was
with
a
great
pang
mercifully
spared
me
i
could
take
back
to
my
heart
my
childish
prayer
to
be
all
he
had
so
brightly
shown
himself
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
undone
no
chain
for
me
to
break
or
for
him
to
drag
and
i
could
go
please
god
my
lowly
way
along
the
path
of
duty
and
he
could
go
his
nobler
way
upon
its
broader
road
and
though
we
were
apart
upon
the
journey
i
might
aspire
to
meet
him
unselfishly
innocently
better
far
than
he
had
thought
me
when
i
found
some
favour
in
his
eyes
at
the
journey
end
chapter
xxxvi
chesney
wold
charley
and
i
did
not
set
off
alone
upon
our
expedition
into
lincolnshire
my
guardian
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
lose
sight
of
me
until
i
was
safe
in
boythorn
house
so
he
accompanied
us
and
we
were
two
days
upon
the
road
i
found
every
breath
of
air
and
every
scent
and
every
flower
and
leaf
and
blade
of
grass
and
every
passing
cloud
and
everything
in
nature
more
beautiful
and
wonderful
to
me
than
i
had
ever
found
it
yet
this
was
my
first
gain
from
my
illness
how
little
i
had
lost
when
the
wide
world
was
so
full
of
delight
for
me
my
guardian
intending
to
go
back
immediately
we
appointed
on
our
way
down
a
day
when
my
dear
girl
should
come
i
wrote
her
a
letter
of
which
he
took
charge
and
he
left
us
within
half
an
hour
of
our
arrival
at
our
destination
on
a
delightful
evening
in
the
early
if
a
good
fairy
had
built
the
house
for
me
with
a
wave
of
her
wand
and
i
had
been
a
princess
and
her
favoured
i
could
not
have
been
more
considered
in
it
so
many
preparations
were
made
for
me
and
such
an
endearing
remembrance
was
shown
of
all
my
little
tastes
and
likings
that
i
could
have
sat
down
overcome
a
dozen
times
before
i
had
revisited
half
the
rooms
i
did
better
than
that
however
by
showing
them
all
to
charley
instead
charley
delight
calmed
mine
and
after
we
had
had
a
walk
in
the
garden
and
charley
had
exhausted
her
whole
vocabulary
of
admiring
expressions
i
was
as
tranquilly
happy
as
i
ought
to
have
been
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
be
able
to
say
to
myself
after
tea
esther
my
dear
i
think
you
are
quite
sensible
enough
to
sit
down
now
and
write
a
note
of
thanks
to
your
host
he
had
left
a
note
of
welcome
for
me
as
sunny
as
his
own
face
and
had
confided
his
bird
to
my
care
which
i
knew
to
be
his
highest
mark
of
confidence
accordingly
i
wrote
a
little
note
to
him
in
london
telling
him
how
all
his
favourite
plants
and
trees
were
looking
and
how
the
most
astonishing
of
birds
had
chirped
the
honours
of
the
house
to
me
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
and
how
after
singing
on
my
shoulder
to
the
inconceivable
rapture
of
my
little
maid
he
was
then
at
roost
in
the
usual
corner
of
his
cage
but
whether
dreaming
or
no
i
could
not
report
my
note
finished
and
sent
off
to
the
post
i
made
myself
very
busy
in
unpacking
and
arranging
and
i
sent
charley
to
bed
in
good
time
and
told
her
i
should
want
her
no
more
that
night
for
i
had
not
yet
looked
in
the
glass
and
had
never
asked
to
have
my
own
restored
to
me
i
knew
this
to
be
a
weakness
which
must
be
overcome
but
i
had
always
said
to
myself
that
i
would
begin
afresh
when
i
got
to
where
i
now
was
therefore
i
had
wanted
to
be
alone
and
therefore
i
said
now
alone
in
my
own
room
esther
if
you
are
to
be
happy
if
you
are
to
have
any
right
to
pray
to
be
you
must
keep
your
word
my
dear
i
was
quite
resolved
to
keep
it
but
i
sat
down
for
a
little
while
first
to
reflect
upon
all
my
blessings
and
then
i
said
my
prayers
and
thought
a
little
more
my
hair
had
not
been
cut
off
though
it
had
been
in
danger
more
than
once
it
was
long
and
thick
i
let
it
down
and
shook
it
out
and
went
up
to
the
glass
upon
the
there
was
a
little
muslin
curtain
drawn
across
it
i
drew
it
back
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
through
such
a
veil
of
my
own
hair
that
i
could
see
nothing
else
then
i
put
my
hair
aside
and
looked
at
the
reflection
in
the
mirror
encouraged
by
seeing
how
placidly
it
looked
at
me
i
was
very
much
changed
oh
very
very
much
at
first
my
face
was
so
strange
to
me
that
i
think
i
should
have
put
my
hands
before
it
and
started
back
but
for
the
encouragement
i
have
mentioned
very
soon
it
became
more
familiar
and
then
i
knew
the
extent
of
the
alteration
in
it
better
than
i
had
done
at
first
it
was
not
like
what
i
had
expected
but
i
had
expected
nothing
definite
and
i
dare
say
anything
definite
would
have
surprised
me
i
had
never
been
a
beauty
and
had
never
thought
myself
one
but
i
had
been
very
different
from
this
it
was
all
gone
now
heaven
was
so
good
to
me
that
i
could
let
it
go
with
a
few
not
bitter
tears
and
could
stand
there
arranging
my
hair
for
the
night
quite
thankfully
one
thing
troubled
me
and
i
considered
it
for
a
long
time
before
i
went
to
sleep
i
had
kept
woodcourt
flowers
when
they
were
withered
i
had
dried
them
and
put
them
in
a
book
that
i
was
fond
of
nobody
knew
this
not
even
ada
i
was
doubtful
whether
i
had
a
right
to
preserve
what
he
had
sent
to
one
so
different
whether
it
was
generous
towards
him
to
do
it
i
wished
to
be
generous
to
him
even
in
the
secret
depths
of
my
heart
which
he
would
never
know
because
i
could
have
loved
him
could
have
been
devoted
to
him
at
last
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
might
keep
them
if
i
treasured
them
only
as
a
remembrance
of
what
was
irrevocably
past
and
gone
never
to
be
looked
back
on
any
more
in
any
other
light
i
hope
this
may
not
seem
trivial
i
was
very
much
in
earnest
i
took
care
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
and
to
be
before
the
glass
when
charley
came
in
on
tiptoe
dear
dear
miss
cried
charley
starting
is
that
you
yes
charley
said
i
quietly
putting
up
my
hair
and
i
am
very
well
indeed
and
very
happy
i
saw
it
was
a
weight
off
charley
mind
but
it
was
a
greater
weight
off
mine
i
knew
the
worst
now
and
was
composed
to
it
i
shall
not
conceal
as
i
go
on
the
weaknesses
i
could
not
quite
conquer
but
they
always
passed
from
me
soon
and
the
happier
frame
of
mind
stayed
by
me
faithfully
wishing
to
be
fully
in
my
strength
and
my
good
spirits
before
ada
came
i
now
laid
down
a
little
series
of
plans
with
charley
for
being
in
the
fresh
air
all
day
long
we
were
to
be
out
before
breakfast
and
were
to
dine
early
and
were
to
be
out
again
before
and
after
dinner
and
were
to
talk
in
the
garden
after
tea
and
were
to
go
to
rest
betimes
and
were
to
climb
every
hill
and
explore
every
road
lane
and
field
in
the
neighbourhood
as
to
restoratives
and
strengthening
delicacies
boythorn
good
housekeeper
was
for
ever
trotting
about
with
something
to
eat
or
drink
in
her
hand
i
could
not
even
be
heard
of
as
resting
in
the
park
but
she
would
come
trotting
after
me
with
a
basket
her
cheerful
face
shining
with
a
lecture
on
the
importance
of
frequent
nourishment
then
there
was
a
pony
expressly
for
my
riding
a
chubby
pony
with
a
short
neck
and
a
mane
all
over
his
eyes
who
could
canter
when
he
would
so
easily
and
quietly
that
he
was
a
treasure
in
a
very
few
days
he
would
come
to
me
in
the
paddock
when
i
called
him
and
eat
out
of
my
hand
and
follow
me
about
we
arrived
at
such
a
capital
understanding
that
when
he
was
jogging
with
me
lazily
and
rather
obstinately
down
some
shady
lane
if
i
patted
his
neck
and
said
stubbs
i
am
surprised
you
do
canter
when
you
know
how
much
i
like
it
and
i
think
you
might
oblige
me
for
you
are
only
getting
stupid
and
going
to
sleep
he
would
give
his
head
a
comical
shake
or
two
and
set
off
directly
while
charley
would
stand
still
and
laugh
with
such
enjoyment
that
her
laughter
was
like
music
i
do
know
who
had
given
stubbs
his
name
but
it
seemed
to
belong
to
him
as
naturally
as
his
rough
coat
once
we
put
him
in
a
little
chaise
and
drove
him
triumphantly
through
the
green
lanes
for
five
miles
but
all
at
once
as
we
were
extolling
him
to
the
skies
he
seemed
to
take
it
ill
that
he
should
have
been
accompanied
so
far
by
the
circle
of
tantalizing
little
gnats
that
had
been
hovering
round
and
round
his
ears
the
whole
way
without
appearing
to
advance
an
inch
and
stopped
to
think
about
it
i
suppose
he
came
to
the
decision
that
it
was
not
to
be
borne
for
he
steadily
refused
to
move
until
i
gave
the
reins
to
charley
and
got
out
and
walked
when
he
followed
me
with
a
sturdy
sort
of
good
humour
putting
his
head
under
my
arm
and
rubbing
his
ear
against
my
sleeve
it
was
in
vain
for
me
to
say
now
stubbs
i
feel
quite
sure
from
what
i
know
of
you
that
you
will
go
on
if
i
ride
a
little
while
for
the
moment
i
left
him
he
stood
stock
still
again
consequently
i
was
obliged
to
lead
the
way
as
before
and
in
this
order
we
returned
home
to
the
great
delight
of
the
village
charley
and
i
had
reason
to
call
it
the
most
friendly
of
villages
i
am
sure
for
in
a
week
time
the
people
were
so
glad
to
see
us
go
by
though
ever
so
frequently
in
the
course
of
a
day
that
there
were
faces
of
greeting
in
every
cottage
i
had
known
many
of
the
grown
people
before
and
almost
all
the
children
but
now
the
very
steeple
began
to
wear
a
familiar
and
affectionate
look
among
my
new
friends
was
an
old
old
woman
who
lived
in
such
a
little
thatched
and
whitewashed
dwelling
that
when
the
outside
shutter
was
turned
up
on
its
hinges
it
shut
up
the
whole
this
old
lady
had
a
grandson
who
was
a
sailor
and
i
wrote
a
letter
to
him
for
her
and
drew
at
the
top
of
it
the
in
which
she
had
brought
him
up
and
where
his
old
stool
yet
occupied
its
old
place
this
was
considered
by
the
whole
village
the
most
wonderful
achievement
in
the
world
but
when
an
answer
came
back
all
the
way
from
plymouth
in
which
he
mentioned
that
he
was
going
to
take
the
picture
all
the
way
to
america
and
from
america
would
write
again
i
got
all
the
credit
that
ought
to
have
been
given
to
the
and
was
invested
with
the
merit
of
the
whole
system
thus
what
with
being
so
much
in
the
air
playing
with
so
many
children
gossiping
with
so
many
people
sitting
on
invitation
in
so
many
cottages
going
on
with
charley
education
and
writing
long
letters
to
ada
every
day
i
had
scarcely
any
time
to
think
about
that
little
loss
of
mine
and
was
almost
always
cheerful
if
i
did
think
of
it
at
odd
moments
now
and
then
i
had
only
to
be
busy
and
forget
it
i
felt
it
more
than
i
had
hoped
i
should
once
when
a
child
said
mother
why
is
the
lady
not
a
pretty
lady
now
like
she
used
to
be
but
when
i
found
the
child
was
not
less
fond
of
me
and
drew
its
soft
hand
over
my
face
with
a
kind
of
pitying
protection
in
its
touch
that
soon
set
me
up
again
there
were
many
little
occurrences
which
suggested
to
me
with
great
consolation
how
natural
it
is
to
gentle
hearts
to
be
considerate
and
delicate
towards
any
inferiority
one
of
these
particularly
touched
me
i
happened
to
stroll
into
the
little
church
when
a
marriage
was
just
concluded
and
the
young
couple
had
to
sign
the
register
the
bridegroom
to
whom
the
pen
was
handed
first
made
a
rude
cross
for
his
mark
the
bride
who
came
next
did
the
same
now
i
had
known
the
bride
when
i
was
last
there
not
only
as
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
place
but
as
having
quite
distinguished
herself
in
the
school
and
i
could
not
help
looking
at
her
with
some
surprise
she
came
aside
and
whispered
to
me
while
tears
of
honest
love
and
admiration
stood
in
her
bright
eyes
he
a
dear
good
fellow
miss
but
he
ca
write
yet
he
going
to
learn
of
me
and
i
shame
him
for
the
world
why
what
had
i
to
fear
i
thought
when
there
was
this
nobility
in
the
soul
of
a
labouring
man
daughter
the
air
blew
as
freshly
and
revivingly
upon
me
as
it
had
ever
blown
and
the
healthy
colour
came
into
my
new
face
as
it
had
come
into
my
old
one
charley
was
wonderful
to
see
she
was
so
radiant
and
so
rosy
and
we
both
enjoyed
the
whole
day
and
slept
soundly
the
whole
night
there
was
a
favourite
spot
of
mine
in
the
of
chesney
wold
where
a
seat
had
been
erected
commanding
a
lovely
view
the
wood
had
been
cleared
and
opened
to
improve
this
point
of
sight
and
the
bright
sunny
landscape
beyond
was
so
beautiful
that
i
rested
there
at
least
once
every
day
a
picturesque
part
of
the
hall
called
the
ghost
walk
was
seen
to
advantage
from
this
higher
ground
and
the
startling
name
and
the
old
legend
in
the
dedlock
family
which
i
had
heard
from
boythorn
accounting
for
it
mingled
with
the
view
and
gave
it
something
of
a
mysterious
interest
in
addition
to
its
real
charms
there
was
a
bank
here
too
which
was
a
famous
one
for
violets
and
as
it
was
a
daily
delight
of
charley
to
gather
wild
flowers
she
took
as
much
to
the
spot
as
i
did
it
would
be
idle
to
inquire
now
why
i
never
went
close
to
the
house
or
never
went
inside
it
the
family
were
not
there
i
had
heard
on
my
arrival
and
were
not
expected
i
was
far
from
being
incurious
or
uninterested
about
the
building
on
the
contrary
i
often
sat
in
this
place
wondering
how
the
rooms
ranged
and
whether
any
echo
like
a
footstep
really
did
resound
at
times
as
the
story
said
upon
the
lonely
ghost
walk
the
indefinable
feeling
with
which
lady
dedlock
had
impressed
me
may
have
had
some
influence
in
keeping
me
from
the
house
even
when
she
was
absent
i
am
not
sure
her
face
and
figure
were
associated
with
it
naturally
but
i
can
not
say
that
they
repelled
me
from
it
though
something
did
for
whatever
reason
or
no
reason
i
had
never
once
gone
near
it
down
to
the
day
at
which
my
story
now
arrives
i
was
resting
at
my
favourite
point
after
a
long
ramble
and
charley
was
gathering
violets
at
a
little
distance
from
me
i
had
been
looking
at
the
ghost
walk
lying
in
a
deep
shade
of
masonry
afar
off
and
picturing
to
myself
the
female
shape
that
was
said
to
haunt
it
when
i
became
aware
of
a
figure
approaching
through
the
wood
the
perspective
was
so
long
and
so
darkened
by
leaves
and
the
shadows
of
the
branches
on
the
ground
made
it
so
much
more
intricate
to
the
eye
that
at
first
i
could
not
discern
what
figure
it
was
by
little
and
little
it
revealed
itself
to
be
a
woman
a
lady
lady
dedlock
she
was
alone
and
coming
to
where
i
sat
with
a
much
quicker
step
i
observed
to
my
surprise
than
was
usual
with
her
i
was
fluttered
by
her
being
unexpectedly
so
near
she
was
almost
within
speaking
distance
before
i
knew
her
and
would
have
risen
to
continue
my
walk
but
i
could
not
i
was
rendered
motionless
not
so
much
by
her
hurried
gesture
of
entreaty
not
so
much
by
her
quick
advance
and
outstretched
hands
not
so
much
by
the
great
change
in
her
manner
and
the
absence
of
her
haughty
as
by
a
something
in
her
face
that
i
had
pined
for
and
dreamed
of
when
i
was
a
little
child
something
i
had
never
seen
in
any
face
something
i
had
never
seen
in
hers
before
a
dread
and
faintness
fell
upon
me
and
i
called
to
charley
lady
dedlock
stopped
upon
the
instant
and
changed
back
almost
to
what
i
had
known
her
miss
summerson
i
am
afraid
i
have
startled
you
she
said
now
advancing
slowly
you
can
scarcely
be
strong
yet
you
have
been
very
ill
i
know
i
have
been
much
concerned
to
hear
it
i
could
no
more
have
removed
my
eyes
from
her
pale
face
than
i
could
have
stirred
from
the
bench
on
which
i
sat
she
gave
me
her
hand
and
its
deadly
coldness
so
at
variance
with
the
enforced
composure
of
her
features
deepened
the
fascination
that
overpowered
me
i
can
not
say
what
was
in
my
whirling
thoughts
you
are
recovering
again
she
asked
kindly
i
was
quite
well
but
a
moment
ago
lady
dedlock
is
this
your
young
attendant
yes
will
you
send
her
on
before
and
walk
towards
your
house
with
me
charley
said
i
take
your
flowers
home
and
i
will
follow
you
directly
charley
with
her
best
curtsy
blushingly
tied
on
her
bonnet
and
went
her
way
when
she
was
gone
lady
dedlock
sat
down
on
the
seat
beside
me
i
can
not
tell
in
any
words
what
the
state
of
my
mind
was
when
i
saw
in
her
hand
my
handkerchief
with
which
i
had
covered
the
dead
baby
i
looked
at
her
but
i
could
not
see
her
i
could
not
hear
her
i
could
not
draw
my
breath
the
beating
of
my
heart
was
so
violent
and
wild
that
i
felt
as
if
my
life
were
breaking
from
me
but
when
she
caught
me
to
her
breast
kissed
me
wept
over
me
compassionated
me
and
called
me
back
to
myself
when
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
and
cried
to
me
oh
my
child
my
child
i
am
your
wicked
and
unhappy
mother
oh
try
to
forgive
me
when
i
saw
her
at
my
feet
on
the
bare
earth
in
her
great
agony
of
mind
i
felt
through
all
my
tumult
of
emotion
a
burst
of
gratitude
to
the
providence
of
god
that
i
was
so
changed
as
that
i
never
could
disgrace
her
by
any
trace
of
likeness
as
that
nobody
could
ever
now
look
at
me
and
look
at
her
and
remotely
think
of
any
near
tie
between
us
i
raised
my
mother
up
praying
and
beseeching
her
not
to
stoop
before
me
in
such
affliction
and
humiliation
i
did
so
in
broken
incoherent
words
for
besides
the
trouble
i
was
in
it
frightened
me
to
see
her
at
my
feet
i
told
her
or
i
tried
to
tell
her
that
if
it
were
for
me
her
child
under
any
circumstances
to
take
upon
me
to
forgive
her
i
did
it
and
had
done
it
many
many
years
i
told
her
that
my
heart
overflowed
with
love
for
her
that
it
was
natural
love
which
nothing
in
the
past
had
changed
or
could
change
that
it
was
not
for
me
then
resting
for
the
first
time
on
my
mother
bosom
to
take
her
to
account
for
having
given
me
life
but
that
my
duty
was
to
bless
her
and
receive
her
though
the
whole
world
turned
from
her
and
that
i
only
asked
her
leave
to
do
it
i
held
my
mother
in
my
embrace
and
she
held
me
in
hers
and
among
the
still
woods
in
the
silence
of
the
summer
day
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
our
two
troubled
minds
that
was
not
at
peace
to
bless
and
receive
me
groaned
my
mother
it
is
far
too
late
i
must
travel
my
dark
road
alone
and
it
will
lead
me
where
it
will
from
day
to
day
sometimes
from
hour
to
hour
i
do
not
see
the
way
before
my
guilty
feet
this
is
the
earthly
punishment
i
have
brought
upon
myself
i
bear
it
and
i
hide
it
even
in
the
thinking
of
her
endurance
she
drew
her
habitual
air
of
proud
indifference
about
her
like
a
veil
though
she
soon
cast
it
off
again
i
must
keep
this
secret
if
by
any
means
it
can
be
kept
not
wholly
for
myself
i
have
a
husband
wretched
and
dishonouring
creature
that
i
am
these
words
she
uttered
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
despair
more
terrible
in
its
sound
than
any
shriek
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
shrank
down
in
my
embrace
as
if
she
were
unwilling
that
i
should
touch
her
nor
could
i
by
my
utmost
persuasions
or
by
any
endearments
i
could
use
prevail
upon
her
to
rise
she
said
no
no
no
she
could
only
speak
to
me
so
she
must
be
proud
and
disdainful
everywhere
else
she
would
be
humbled
and
ashamed
there
in
the
only
natural
moments
of
her
life
my
unhappy
mother
told
me
that
in
my
illness
she
had
been
nearly
frantic
she
had
but
then
known
that
her
child
was
living
she
could
not
have
suspected
me
to
be
that
child
before
she
had
followed
me
down
here
to
speak
to
me
but
once
in
all
her
life
we
never
could
associate
never
could
communicate
never
probably
from
that
time
forth
could
interchange
another
word
on
earth
she
put
into
my
hands
a
letter
she
had
written
for
my
reading
only
and
said
when
i
had
read
it
and
destroyed
it
but
not
so
much
for
her
sake
since
she
asked
nothing
as
for
her
husband
and
my
own
i
must
evermore
consider
her
as
dead
if
i
could
believe
that
she
loved
me
in
this
agony
in
which
i
saw
her
with
a
mother
love
she
asked
me
to
do
that
for
then
i
might
think
of
her
with
a
greater
pity
imagining
what
she
suffered
she
had
put
herself
beyond
all
hope
and
beyond
all
help
whether
she
preserved
her
secret
until
death
or
it
came
to
be
discovered
and
she
brought
dishonour
and
disgrace
upon
the
name
she
had
taken
it
was
her
solitary
struggle
always
and
no
affection
could
come
near
her
and
no
human
creature
could
render
her
any
aid
but
is
the
secret
safe
so
far
i
asked
is
it
safe
now
dearest
mother
no
replied
my
mother
it
has
been
very
near
discovery
it
was
saved
by
an
accident
it
may
be
lost
by
another
accident
any
day
do
you
dread
a
particular
person
hush
do
not
tremble
and
cry
so
much
for
me
i
am
not
worthy
of
these
tears
said
my
mother
kissing
my
hands
i
dread
one
person
very
much
an
enemy
not
a
friend
one
who
is
too
passionless
to
be
either
he
is
sir
leicester
dedlock
lawyer
mechanically
faithful
without
attachment
and
very
jealous
of
the
profit
privilege
and
reputation
of
being
master
of
the
mysteries
of
great
houses
has
he
any
suspicions
many
not
of
you
i
said
alarmed
yes
he
is
always
vigilant
and
always
near
me
i
may
keep
him
at
a
standstill
but
i
can
never
shake
him
off
has
he
so
little
pity
or
compunction
he
has
none
and
no
anger
he
is
indifferent
to
everything
but
his
calling
his
calling
is
the
acquisition
of
secrets
and
the
holding
possession
of
such
power
as
they
give
him
with
no
sharer
or
opponent
in
it
could
you
trust
in
him
i
shall
never
try
the
dark
road
i
have
trodden
for
so
many
years
will
end
where
it
will
i
follow
it
alone
to
the
end
whatever
the
end
be
it
may
be
near
it
may
be
distant
while
the
road
lasts
nothing
turns
me
dear
mother
are
you
so
resolved
i
am
resolved
i
have
long
outbidden
folly
with
folly
pride
with
pride
scorn
with
scorn
insolence
with
insolence
and
have
outlived
many
vanities
with
many
more
i
will
outlive
this
danger
and
outdie
it
if
i
can
it
has
closed
around
me
almost
as
awfully
as
if
these
woods
of
chesney
wold
had
closed
around
the
house
but
my
course
through
it
is
the
same
i
have
but
one
i
can
have
but
one
jarndyce
i
was
beginning
when
my
mother
hurriedly
inquired
does
he
suspect
no
said
i
no
indeed
be
assured
that
he
does
not
and
i
told
her
what
he
had
related
to
me
as
his
knowledge
of
my
story
but
he
is
so
good
and
sensible
said
i
that
perhaps
if
he
knew
my
mother
who
until
this
time
had
made
no
change
in
her
position
raised
her
hand
up
to
my
lips
and
stopped
me
confide
fully
in
him
she
said
after
a
little
while
you
have
my
free
consent
a
small
gift
from
such
a
mother
to
her
injured
child
but
do
not
tell
me
of
it
some
pride
is
left
in
me
even
yet
i
explained
as
nearly
as
i
could
then
or
can
recall
now
for
my
agitation
and
distress
throughout
were
so
great
that
i
scarcely
understood
myself
though
every
word
that
was
uttered
in
the
voice
so
unfamiliar
and
so
melancholy
to
me
which
in
my
childhood
i
had
never
learned
to
love
and
recognize
had
never
been
sung
to
sleep
with
had
never
heard
a
blessing
from
had
never
had
a
hope
inspired
by
made
an
enduring
impression
on
my
memory
i
say
i
explained
or
tried
to
do
it
how
i
had
only
hoped
that
jarndyce
who
had
been
the
best
of
fathers
to
me
might
be
able
to
afford
some
counsel
and
support
to
her
but
my
mother
answered
no
it
was
impossible
no
one
could
help
her
through
the
desert
that
lay
before
her
she
must
go
alone
my
child
my
child
she
said
for
the
last
time
these
kisses
for
the
last
time
these
arms
upon
my
neck
for
the
last
time
we
shall
meet
no
more
to
hope
to
do
what
i
seek
to
do
i
must
be
what
i
have
been
so
long
such
is
my
reward
and
doom
if
you
hear
of
lady
dedlock
brilliant
prosperous
and
flattered
think
of
your
wretched
mother
underneath
that
mask
think
that
the
reality
is
in
her
suffering
in
her
useless
remorse
in
her
murdering
within
her
breast
the
only
love
and
truth
of
which
it
is
capable
and
then
forgive
her
if
you
can
and
cry
to
heaven
to
forgive
her
which
it
never
can
we
held
one
another
for
a
little
space
yet
but
she
was
so
firm
that
she
took
my
hands
away
and
put
them
back
against
my
breast
and
with
a
last
kiss
as
she
held
them
there
released
them
and
went
from
me
into
the
wood
i
was
alone
and
calm
and
quiet
below
me
in
the
sun
and
shade
lay
the
old
house
with
its
terraces
and
turrets
on
which
there
had
seemed
to
me
to
be
such
complete
repose
when
i
first
saw
it
but
which
now
looked
like
the
obdurate
and
unpitying
watcher
of
my
mother
misery
stunned
as
i
was
as
weak
and
helpless
at
first
as
i
had
ever
been
in
my
sick
chamber
the
necessity
of
guarding
against
the
danger
of
discovery
or
even
of
the
remotest
suspicion
did
me
service
i
took
such
precautions
as
i
could
to
hide
from
charley
that
i
had
been
crying
and
i
constrained
myself
to
think
of
every
sacred
obligation
that
there
was
upon
me
to
be
careful
and
collected
it
was
not
a
little
while
before
i
could
succeed
or
could
even
restrain
bursts
of
grief
but
after
an
hour
or
so
i
was
better
and
felt
that
i
might
return
i
went
home
very
slowly
and
told
charley
whom
i
found
at
the
gate
looking
for
me
that
i
had
been
tempted
to
extend
my
walk
after
lady
dedlock
had
left
me
and
that
i
was
and
would
lie
down
safe
in
my
own
room
i
read
the
letter
i
clearly
derived
from
it
and
that
was
much
then
that
i
had
not
been
abandoned
by
my
mother
her
elder
and
only
sister
the
godmother
of
my
childhood
discovering
signs
of
life
in
me
when
i
had
been
laid
aside
as
dead
had
in
her
stern
sense
of
duty
with
no
desire
or
willingness
that
i
should
live
reared
me
in
rigid
secrecy
and
had
never
again
beheld
my
mother
face
from
within
a
few
hours
of
my
birth
so
strangely
did
i
hold
my
place
in
this
world
that
until
within
a
short
time
back
i
had
never
to
my
own
mother
knowledge
breathed
had
been
buried
had
never
been
endowed
with
life
had
never
borne
a
name
when
she
had
first
seen
me
in
the
church
she
had
been
startled
and
had
thought
of
what
would
have
been
like
me
if
it
had
ever
lived
and
had
lived
on
but
that
was
all
then
what
more
the
letter
told
me
needs
not
to
be
repeated
here
it
has
its
own
times
and
places
in
my
story
my
first
care
was
to
burn
what
my
mother
had
written
and
to
consume
even
its
ashes
i
hope
it
may
not
appear
very
unnatural
or
bad
in
me
that
i
then
became
heavily
sorrowful
to
think
i
had
ever
been
reared
that
i
felt
as
if
i
knew
it
would
have
been
better
and
happier
for
many
people
if
indeed
i
had
never
breathed
that
i
had
a
terror
of
myself
as
the
danger
and
the
possible
disgrace
of
my
own
mother
and
of
a
proud
family
name
that
i
was
so
confused
and
shaken
as
to
be
possessed
by
a
belief
that
it
was
right
and
had
been
intended
that
i
should
die
in
my
birth
and
that
it
was
wrong
and
not
intended
that
i
should
be
then
alive
these
are
the
real
feelings
that
i
had
i
fell
asleep
worn
out
and
when
i
awoke
i
cried
afresh
to
think
that
i
was
back
in
the
world
with
my
load
of
trouble
for
others
i
was
more
than
ever
frightened
of
myself
thinking
anew
of
her
against
whom
i
was
a
witness
of
the
owner
of
chesney
wold
of
the
new
and
terrible
meaning
of
the
old
words
now
moaning
in
my
ear
like
a
surge
upon
the
shore
your
mother
esther
was
your
disgrace
and
you
are
hers
the
time
will
come
and
soon
enough
when
you
will
understand
this
better
and
will
feel
it
too
as
no
one
save
a
woman
can
with
them
those
other
words
returned
pray
daily
that
the
sins
of
others
be
not
visited
upon
your
head
i
could
not
disentangle
all
that
was
about
me
and
i
felt
as
if
the
blame
and
the
shame
were
all
in
me
and
the
visitation
had
come
down
the
day
waned
into
a
gloomy
evening
overcast
and
sad
and
i
still
contended
with
the
same
distress
i
went
out
alone
and
after
walking
a
little
in
the
park
watching
the
dark
shades
falling
on
the
trees
and
the
fitful
flight
of
the
bats
which
sometimes
almost
touched
me
was
attracted
to
the
house
for
the
first
time
perhaps
i
might
not
have
gone
near
it
if
i
had
been
in
a
stronger
frame
of
mind
as
it
was
i
took
the
path
that
led
close
by
it
i
did
not
dare
to
linger
or
to
look
up
but
i
passed
before
the
terrace
garden
with
its
fragrant
odours
and
its
broad
walks
and
its
beds
and
smooth
turf
and
i
saw
how
beautiful
and
grave
it
was
and
how
the
old
stone
balustrades
and
parapets
and
wide
flights
of
shallow
steps
were
seamed
by
time
and
weather
and
how
the
trained
moss
and
ivy
grew
about
them
and
around
the
old
stone
pedestal
of
the
and
i
heard
the
fountain
falling
then
the
way
went
by
long
lines
of
dark
windows
diversified
by
turreted
towers
and
porches
of
eccentric
shapes
where
old
stone
lions
and
grotesque
monsters
bristled
outside
dens
of
shadow
and
snarled
at
the
evening
gloom
over
the
escutcheons
they
held
in
their
grip
thence
the
path
wound
underneath
a
gateway
and
through
a
where
the
principal
entrance
was
i
hurried
quickly
on
and
by
the
stables
where
none
but
deep
voices
seemed
to
be
whether
in
the
murmuring
of
the
wind
through
the
strong
mass
of
ivy
holding
to
a
high
red
wall
or
in
the
low
complaining
of
the
weathercock
or
in
the
barking
of
the
dogs
or
in
the
slow
striking
of
a
clock
so
encountering
presently
a
sweet
smell
of
limes
whose
rustling
i
could
hear
i
turned
with
the
turning
of
the
path
to
the
south
front
and
there
above
me
were
the
balustrades
of
the
ghost
walk
and
one
lighted
window
that
might
be
my
mother
the
way
was
paved
here
like
the
terrace
overhead
and
my
footsteps
from
being
noiseless
made
an
echoing
sound
upon
the
flags
stopping
to
look
at
nothing
but
seeing
all
i
did
see
as
i
went
i
was
passing
quickly
on
and
in
a
few
moments
should
have
passed
the
lighted
window
when
my
echoing
footsteps
brought
it
suddenly
into
my
mind
that
there
was
a
dreadful
truth
in
the
legend
of
the
ghost
walk
that
it
was
i
who
was
to
bring
calamity
upon
the
stately
house
and
that
my
warning
feet
were
haunting
it
even
then
seized
with
an
augmented
terror
of
myself
which
turned
me
cold
i
ran
from
myself
and
everything
retraced
the
way
by
which
i
had
come
and
never
paused
until
i
had
gained
the
and
the
park
lay
sullen
and
black
behind
me
not
before
i
was
alone
in
my
own
room
for
the
night
and
had
again
been
dejected
and
unhappy
there
did
i
begin
to
know
how
wrong
and
thankless
this
state
was
but
from
my
darling
who
was
coming
on
the
morrow
i
found
a
joyful
letter
full
of
such
loving
anticipation
that
i
must
have
been
of
marble
if
it
had
not
moved
me
from
my
guardian
too
i
found
another
letter
asking
me
to
tell
dame
durden
if
i
should
see
that
little
woman
anywhere
that
they
had
moped
most
pitiably
without
her
that
the
housekeeping
was
going
to
rack
and
ruin
that
nobody
else
could
manage
the
keys
and
that
everybody
in
and
about
the
house
declared
it
was
not
the
same
house
and
was
becoming
rebellious
for
her
return
two
such
letters
together
made
me
think
how
far
beyond
my
deserts
i
was
beloved
and
how
happy
i
ought
to
be
that
made
me
think
of
all
my
past
life
and
that
brought
me
as
it
ought
to
have
done
before
into
a
better
condition
for
i
saw
very
well
that
i
could
not
have
been
intended
to
die
or
i
should
never
have
lived
not
to
say
should
never
have
been
reserved
for
such
a
happy
life
i
saw
very
well
how
many
things
had
worked
together
for
my
welfare
and
that
if
the
sins
of
the
fathers
were
sometimes
visited
upon
the
children
the
phrase
did
not
mean
what
i
had
in
the
morning
feared
it
meant
i
knew
i
was
as
innocent
of
my
birth
as
a
queen
of
hers
and
that
before
my
heavenly
father
i
should
not
be
punished
for
birth
nor
a
queen
rewarded
for
it
i
had
had
experience
in
the
shock
of
that
very
day
that
i
could
even
thus
soon
find
comforting
reconcilements
to
the
change
that
had
fallen
on
me
i
renewed
my
resolutions
and
prayed
to
be
strengthened
in
them
pouring
out
my
heart
for
myself
and
for
my
unhappy
mother
and
feeling
that
the
darkness
of
the
morning
was
passing
away
it
was
not
upon
my
sleep
and
when
the
next
day
light
awoke
me
it
was
gone
my
dear
girl
was
to
arrive
at
five
in
the
afternoon
how
to
help
myself
through
the
intermediate
time
better
than
by
taking
a
long
walk
along
the
road
by
which
she
was
to
come
i
did
not
know
so
charley
and
i
and
stubbs
stubbs
saddled
for
we
never
drove
him
after
the
one
great
occasion
made
a
long
expedition
along
that
road
and
back
on
our
return
we
held
a
great
review
of
the
house
and
garden
and
saw
that
everything
was
in
its
prettiest
condition
and
had
the
bird
out
ready
as
an
important
part
of
the
establishment
there
were
more
than
two
full
hours
yet
to
elapse
before
she
could
come
and
in
that
interval
which
seemed
a
long
one
i
must
confess
i
was
nervously
anxious
about
my
altered
looks
i
loved
my
darling
so
well
that
i
was
more
concerned
for
their
effect
on
her
than
on
any
one
i
was
not
in
this
slight
distress
because
i
at
all
repined
i
am
quite
certain
i
did
not
that
day
but
i
thought
would
she
be
wholly
prepared
when
she
first
saw
me
might
she
not
be
a
little
shocked
and
disappointed
might
it
not
prove
a
little
worse
than
she
expected
might
she
not
look
for
her
old
esther
and
not
find
her
might
she
not
have
to
grow
used
to
me
and
to
begin
all
over
again
i
knew
the
various
expressions
of
my
sweet
girl
face
so
well
and
it
was
such
an
honest
face
in
its
loveliness
that
i
was
sure
beforehand
she
could
not
hide
that
first
look
from
me
and
i
considered
whether
if
it
should
signify
any
one
of
these
meanings
which
was
so
very
likely
could
i
quite
answer
for
myself
well
i
thought
i
could
after
last
night
i
thought
i
could
but
to
wait
and
wait
and
expect
and
expect
and
think
and
think
was
such
bad
preparation
that
i
resolved
to
go
along
the
road
again
and
meet
her
so
i
said
to
charley
charley
i
will
go
by
myself
and
walk
along
the
road
until
she
comes
charley
highly
approving
of
anything
that
pleased
me
i
went
and
left
her
at
home
but
before
i
got
to
the
second
milestone
i
had
been
in
so
many
palpitations
from
seeing
dust
in
the
distance
though
i
knew
it
was
not
and
could
not
be
the
coach
yet
that
i
resolved
to
turn
back
and
go
home
again
and
when
i
had
turned
i
was
in
such
fear
of
the
coach
coming
up
behind
me
though
i
still
knew
that
it
neither
would
nor
could
do
any
such
thing
that
i
ran
the
greater
part
of
the
way
to
avoid
being
overtaken
then
i
considered
when
i
had
got
safe
back
again
this
was
a
nice
thing
to
have
done
now
i
was
hot
and
had
made
the
worst
of
it
instead
of
the
best
at
last
when
i
believed
there
was
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
yet
charley
all
at
once
cried
out
to
me
as
i
was
trembling
in
the
garden
here
she
comes
miss
here
she
is
i
did
not
mean
to
do
it
but
i
ran
upstairs
into
my
room
and
hid
myself
behind
the
door
there
i
stood
trembling
even
when
i
heard
my
darling
calling
as
she
came
upstairs
esther
my
dear
my
love
where
are
you
little
woman
dear
dame
durden
she
ran
in
and
was
running
out
again
when
she
saw
me
ah
my
angel
girl
the
old
dear
look
all
love
all
fondness
all
affection
nothing
else
in
it
no
nothing
nothing
oh
how
happy
i
was
down
upon
the
floor
with
my
sweet
beautiful
girl
down
upon
the
floor
too
holding
my
scarred
face
to
her
lovely
cheek
bathing
it
with
tears
and
kisses
rocking
me
to
and
fro
like
a
child
calling
me
by
every
tender
name
that
she
could
think
of
and
pressing
me
to
her
faithful
heart
chapter
xxxvii
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
if
the
secret
i
had
to
keep
had
been
mine
i
must
have
confided
it
to
ada
before
we
had
been
long
together
but
it
was
not
mine
and
i
did
not
feel
that
i
had
a
right
to
tell
it
even
to
my
guardian
unless
some
great
emergency
arose
it
was
a
weight
to
bear
alone
still
my
present
duty
appeared
to
be
plain
and
blest
in
the
attachment
of
my
dear
i
did
not
want
an
impulse
and
encouragement
to
do
it
though
often
when
she
was
asleep
and
all
was
quiet
the
remembrance
of
my
mother
kept
me
waking
and
made
the
night
sorrowful
i
did
not
yield
to
it
at
another
time
and
ada
found
me
what
i
used
to
be
except
of
course
in
that
particular
of
which
i
have
said
enough
and
which
i
have
no
intention
of
mentioning
any
more
just
now
if
i
can
help
it
the
difficulty
that
i
felt
in
being
quite
composed
that
first
evening
when
ada
asked
me
over
our
work
if
the
family
were
at
the
house
and
when
i
was
obliged
to
answer
yes
i
believed
so
for
lady
dedlock
had
spoken
to
me
in
the
woods
the
day
before
yesterday
was
great
greater
still
when
ada
asked
me
what
she
had
said
and
when
i
replied
that
she
had
been
kind
and
interested
and
when
ada
while
admitting
her
beauty
and
elegance
remarked
upon
her
proud
manner
and
her
imperious
chilling
air
but
charley
helped
me
through
unconsciously
by
telling
us
that
lady
dedlock
had
only
stayed
at
the
house
two
nights
on
her
way
from
london
to
visit
at
some
other
great
house
in
the
next
county
and
that
she
had
left
early
on
the
morning
after
we
had
seen
her
at
our
view
as
we
called
it
charley
verified
the
adage
about
little
pitchers
i
am
sure
for
she
heard
of
more
sayings
and
doings
in
a
day
than
would
have
come
to
my
ears
in
a
month
we
were
to
stay
a
month
at
boythorn
my
pet
had
scarcely
been
there
a
bright
week
as
i
recollect
the
time
when
one
evening
after
we
had
finished
helping
the
gardener
in
watering
his
flowers
and
just
as
the
candles
were
lighted
charley
appearing
with
a
very
important
air
behind
ada
chair
beckoned
me
mysteriously
out
of
the
room
oh
if
you
please
miss
said
charley
in
a
whisper
with
her
eyes
at
their
roundest
and
largest
you
wanted
at
the
dedlock
arms
why
charley
said
i
who
can
possibly
want
me
at
the
i
do
know
miss
returned
charley
putting
her
head
forward
and
folding
her
hands
tight
upon
the
band
of
her
little
apron
which
she
always
did
in
the
enjoyment
of
anything
mysterious
or
confidential
but
it
a
gentleman
miss
and
his
compliments
and
will
you
please
to
come
without
saying
anything
about
it
whose
compliments
charley
miss
returned
charley
whose
grammatical
education
was
advancing
but
not
very
rapidly
and
how
do
you
come
to
be
the
messenger
charley
i
am
not
the
messenger
if
you
please
miss
returned
my
little
maid
it
was
grubble
miss
and
who
is
grubble
charley
mister
grubble
miss
returned
charley
do
you
know
miss
the
dedlock
arms
by
grubble
which
charley
delivered
as
if
she
were
slowly
spelling
out
the
sign
aye
the
landlord
charley
yes
miss
if
you
please
miss
his
wife
is
a
beautiful
woman
but
she
broke
her
ankle
and
it
never
joined
and
her
brother
the
sawyer
that
was
put
in
the
cage
miss
and
they
expect
he
drink
himself
to
death
entirely
on
beer
said
charley
not
knowing
what
might
be
the
matter
and
being
easily
apprehensive
now
i
thought
it
best
to
go
to
this
place
by
myself
i
bade
charley
be
quick
with
my
bonnet
and
veil
and
my
shawl
and
having
put
them
on
went
away
down
the
little
hilly
street
where
i
was
as
much
at
home
as
in
boythorn
garden
grubble
was
standing
in
his
at
the
door
of
his
very
clean
little
tavern
waiting
for
me
he
lifted
off
his
hat
with
both
hands
when
he
saw
me
coming
and
carrying
it
so
as
if
it
were
an
iron
vessel
it
looked
as
heavy
preceded
me
along
the
sanded
passage
to
his
best
parlour
a
neat
carpeted
room
with
more
plants
in
it
than
were
quite
convenient
a
coloured
print
of
queen
caroline
several
shells
a
good
many
two
stuffed
and
dried
fish
in
glass
cases
and
either
a
curious
egg
or
a
curious
pumpkin
but
i
do
know
which
and
i
doubt
if
many
people
did
hanging
from
his
ceiling
i
knew
grubble
very
well
by
sight
from
his
often
standing
at
his
door
a
stoutish
man
who
never
seemed
to
consider
himself
cozily
dressed
for
his
own
without
his
hat
and
but
who
never
wore
a
coat
except
at
church
he
snuffed
the
candle
and
backing
away
a
little
to
see
how
it
looked
backed
out
of
the
room
unexpectedly
to
me
for
i
was
going
to
ask
him
by
whom
he
had
been
sent
the
door
of
the
opposite
parlour
being
then
opened
i
heard
some
voices
familiar
in
my
ears
i
thought
which
stopped
a
quick
light
step
approached
the
room
in
which
i
was
and
who
should
stand
before
me
but
richard
my
dear
esther
he
said
my
best
friend
and
he
really
was
so
and
earnest
that
in
the
first
surprise
and
pleasure
of
his
brotherly
greeting
i
could
scarcely
find
breath
to
tell
him
that
ada
was
well
answering
my
very
thoughts
always
the
same
dear
girl
said
richard
leading
me
to
a
chair
and
seating
himself
beside
me
i
put
my
veil
up
but
not
quite
always
the
same
dear
girl
said
richard
just
as
heartily
as
before
i
put
up
my
veil
altogether
and
laying
my
hand
on
richard
sleeve
and
looking
in
his
face
told
him
how
much
i
thanked
him
for
his
kind
welcome
and
how
greatly
i
rejoiced
to
see
him
the
more
so
because
of
the
determination
i
had
made
in
my
illness
which
i
now
conveyed
to
him
my
love
said
richard
there
is
no
one
with
whom
i
have
a
greater
wish
to
talk
than
you
for
i
want
you
to
understand
me
and
i
want
you
richard
said
i
shaking
my
head
to
understand
some
one
else
since
you
refer
so
immediately
to
john
jarndyce
said
richard
i
suppose
you
mean
him
of
course
i
do
then
i
may
say
at
once
that
i
am
glad
of
it
because
it
is
on
that
subject
that
i
am
anxious
to
be
understood
by
you
mind
you
my
dear
i
am
not
accountable
to
jarndyce
or
mr
anybody
i
was
pained
to
find
him
taking
this
tone
and
he
observed
it
well
well
my
dear
said
richard
we
wo
go
into
that
now
i
want
to
appear
quietly
in
your
here
with
you
under
my
arm
and
give
my
charming
cousin
a
surprise
i
suppose
your
loyalty
to
john
jarndyce
will
allow
that
my
dear
richard
i
returned
you
know
you
would
be
heartily
welcome
at
his
house
your
home
if
you
will
but
consider
it
so
and
you
are
as
heartily
welcome
here
spoken
like
the
best
of
little
women
cried
richard
gaily
i
asked
him
how
he
liked
his
profession
oh
i
like
it
well
enough
said
richard
it
all
right
it
does
as
well
as
anything
else
for
a
time
i
do
know
that
i
shall
care
about
it
when
i
come
to
be
settled
but
i
can
sell
out
then
and
however
never
mind
all
that
botheration
at
present
so
young
and
handsome
and
in
all
respects
so
perfectly
the
opposite
of
miss
flite
and
yet
in
the
clouded
eager
seeking
look
that
passed
over
him
so
dreadfully
like
her
i
am
in
town
on
leave
just
now
said
richard
indeed
yes
i
have
run
over
to
look
after
my
my
chancery
interests
before
the
long
vacation
said
richard
forcing
a
careless
laugh
we
are
beginning
to
spin
along
with
that
old
suit
at
last
i
promise
you
no
wonder
that
i
shook
my
head
as
you
say
it
not
a
pleasant
subject
richard
spoke
with
the
same
shade
crossing
his
face
as
before
let
it
go
to
the
four
winds
for
puff
gone
who
do
you
suppose
is
with
me
was
it
skimpole
voice
i
heard
that
the
man
he
does
me
more
good
than
anybody
what
a
fascinating
child
it
is
i
asked
richard
if
any
one
knew
of
their
coming
down
together
he
answered
no
nobody
he
had
been
to
call
upon
the
dear
old
infant
so
he
called
skimpole
and
the
dear
old
infant
had
told
him
where
we
were
and
he
had
told
the
dear
old
infant
he
was
bent
on
coming
to
see
us
and
the
dear
old
infant
had
directly
wanted
to
come
too
and
so
he
had
brought
him
and
he
is
worth
not
to
say
his
sordid
expenses
but
thrice
his
weight
in
gold
said
richard
he
is
such
a
cheery
fellow
no
worldliness
about
him
fresh
and
i
certainly
did
not
see
the
proof
of
skimpole
worldliness
in
his
having
his
expenses
paid
by
richard
but
i
made
no
remark
about
that
indeed
he
came
in
and
turned
our
conversation
he
was
charmed
to
see
me
said
he
had
been
shedding
delicious
tears
of
joy
and
sympathy
at
intervals
for
six
weeks
on
my
account
had
never
been
so
happy
as
in
hearing
of
my
progress
began
to
understand
the
mixture
of
good
and
evil
in
the
world
now
felt
that
he
appreciated
health
the
more
when
somebody
else
was
ill
did
know
but
what
it
might
be
in
the
scheme
of
things
that
a
should
squint
to
make
b
happier
in
looking
straight
or
that
c
should
carry
a
wooden
leg
to
make
d
better
satisfied
with
his
flesh
and
blood
in
a
silk
stocking
my
dear
miss
summerson
here
is
our
friend
richard
said
skimpole
full
of
the
brightest
visions
of
the
future
which
he
evokes
out
of
the
darkness
of
chancery
now
that
delightful
inspiriting
that
full
of
poetry
in
old
times
the
woods
and
solitudes
were
made
joyous
to
the
shepherd
by
the
imaginary
piping
and
dancing
of
pan
and
the
nymphs
this
present
shepherd
our
pastoral
richard
brightens
the
dull
inns
of
court
by
making
fortune
and
her
train
sport
through
them
to
the
melodious
notes
of
a
judgment
from
the
bench
that
very
pleasant
you
know
some
growling
fellow
may
say
to
me
the
use
of
these
legal
and
equitable
abuses
how
do
you
defend
them
i
reply
growling
friend
i
do
defend
them
but
they
are
very
agreeable
to
me
there
is
a
shepherd
youth
a
friend
of
mine
who
transmutes
them
into
something
highly
fascinating
to
my
simplicity
i
do
say
it
is
for
this
that
they
exist
for
i
am
a
child
among
you
worldly
grumblers
and
not
called
upon
to
account
to
you
or
myself
for
anything
but
it
may
be
so
i
began
seriously
to
think
that
richard
could
scarcely
have
found
a
worse
friend
than
this
it
made
me
uneasy
that
at
such
a
time
when
he
most
required
some
right
principle
and
purpose
he
should
have
this
captivating
looseness
and
of
everything
this
airy
dispensing
with
all
principle
and
purpose
at
his
elbow
i
thought
i
could
understand
how
such
a
nature
as
my
guardian
experienced
in
the
world
and
forced
to
contemplate
the
miserable
evasions
and
contentions
of
the
family
misfortune
found
an
immense
relief
in
skimpole
avowal
of
his
weaknesses
and
display
of
guileless
candour
but
i
could
not
satisfy
myself
that
it
was
as
artless
as
it
seemed
or
that
it
did
not
serve
skimpole
idle
turn
quite
as
well
as
any
other
part
and
with
less
trouble
they
both
walked
back
with
me
and
skimpole
leaving
us
at
the
gate
i
walked
softly
in
with
richard
and
said
ada
my
love
i
have
brought
a
gentleman
to
visit
you
it
was
not
difficult
to
read
the
blushing
startled
face
she
loved
him
dearly
and
he
knew
it
and
i
knew
it
it
was
a
very
transparent
business
that
meeting
as
cousins
only
i
almost
mistrusted
myself
as
growing
quite
wicked
in
my
suspicions
but
i
was
not
so
sure
that
richard
loved
her
dearly
he
admired
her
very
much
any
one
must
have
done
that
and
i
dare
say
would
have
renewed
their
youthful
engagement
with
great
pride
and
ardour
but
that
he
knew
how
she
would
respect
her
promise
to
my
guardian
still
i
had
a
tormenting
idea
that
the
influence
upon
him
extended
even
here
that
he
was
postponing
his
best
truth
and
earnestness
in
this
as
in
all
things
until
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
should
be
off
his
mind
ah
me
what
richard
would
have
been
without
that
blight
i
never
shall
know
now
he
told
ada
in
his
most
ingenuous
way
that
he
had
not
come
to
make
any
secret
inroad
on
the
terms
she
had
accepted
rather
too
implicitly
and
confidingly
he
thought
from
jarndyce
that
he
had
come
openly
to
see
her
and
to
see
me
and
to
justify
himself
for
the
present
terms
on
which
he
stood
with
jarndyce
as
the
dear
old
infant
would
be
with
us
directly
he
begged
that
i
would
make
an
appointment
for
the
morning
when
he
might
set
himself
right
through
the
means
of
an
unreserved
conversation
with
me
i
proposed
to
walk
with
him
in
the
park
at
seven
and
this
was
arranged
skimpole
soon
afterwards
appeared
and
made
us
merry
for
an
hour
he
particularly
requested
to
see
little
coavinses
meaning
charley
and
told
her
with
a
patriarchal
air
that
he
had
given
her
late
father
all
the
business
in
his
power
and
that
if
one
of
her
little
brothers
would
make
haste
to
get
set
up
in
the
same
profession
he
hoped
he
should
still
be
able
to
put
a
good
deal
of
employment
in
his
way
for
i
am
constantly
being
taken
in
these
nets
said
skimpole
looking
beamingly
at
us
over
a
glass
of
and
am
constantly
being
bailed
out
like
a
boat
or
paid
off
like
a
company
somebody
always
does
it
for
me
i
ca
do
it
you
know
for
i
never
have
any
money
but
somebody
does
it
i
get
out
by
means
i
am
not
like
the
starling
i
get
out
if
you
were
to
ask
me
who
somebody
is
upon
my
word
i
could
tell
you
let
us
drink
to
somebody
god
bless
him
richard
was
a
little
late
in
the
morning
but
i
had
not
to
wait
for
him
long
and
we
turned
into
the
park
the
air
was
bright
and
dewy
and
the
sky
without
a
cloud
the
birds
sang
delightfully
the
sparkles
in
the
fern
the
grass
and
trees
were
exquisite
to
see
the
richness
of
the
woods
seemed
to
have
increased
since
yesterday
as
if
in
the
still
night
when
they
had
looked
so
massively
hushed
in
sleep
nature
through
all
the
minute
details
of
every
wonderful
leaf
had
been
more
wakeful
than
usual
for
the
glory
of
that
day
this
is
a
lovely
place
said
richard
looking
round
none
of
the
jar
and
discord
of
here
but
there
was
other
trouble
i
tell
you
what
my
dear
girl
said
richard
when
i
get
affairs
in
general
settled
i
shall
come
down
here
i
think
and
rest
would
it
not
be
better
to
rest
now
i
asked
oh
as
to
resting
now
said
richard
or
as
to
doing
anything
very
definite
now
that
not
easy
in
short
it
ca
be
done
i
ca
do
it
at
least
why
not
said
i
you
know
why
not
esther
if
you
were
living
in
an
unfinished
house
liable
to
have
the
roof
put
on
or
taken
off
to
be
from
top
to
bottom
pulled
down
or
built
up
next
day
next
week
next
month
next
year
you
would
find
it
hard
to
rest
or
settle
so
do
i
now
there
no
now
for
us
suitors
i
could
almost
have
believed
in
the
attraction
on
which
my
poor
little
wandering
friend
had
expatiated
when
i
saw
again
the
darkened
look
of
last
night
terrible
to
think
it
had
in
it
also
a
shade
of
that
unfortunate
man
who
had
died
my
dear
richard
said
i
this
is
a
bad
beginning
of
our
conversation
i
knew
you
would
tell
me
so
dame
durden
and
not
i
alone
dear
richard
it
was
not
i
who
cautioned
you
once
never
to
found
a
hope
or
expectation
on
the
family
curse
there
you
come
back
to
john
jarndyce
said
richard
impatiently
well
we
must
approach
him
sooner
or
later
for
he
is
the
staple
of
what
i
have
to
say
and
it
as
well
at
once
my
dear
esther
how
can
you
be
so
blind
do
you
see
that
he
is
an
interested
party
and
that
it
may
be
very
well
for
him
to
wish
me
to
know
nothing
of
the
suit
and
care
nothing
about
it
but
that
it
may
not
be
quite
so
well
for
me
oh
richard
i
remonstrated
is
it
possible
that
you
can
ever
have
seen
him
and
heard
him
that
you
can
ever
have
lived
under
his
roof
and
known
him
and
can
yet
breathe
even
to
me
in
this
solitary
place
where
there
is
no
one
to
hear
us
such
unworthy
suspicions
he
reddened
deeply
as
if
his
natural
generosity
felt
a
pang
of
reproach
he
was
silent
for
a
little
while
before
he
replied
in
a
subdued
voice
esther
i
am
sure
you
know
that
i
am
not
a
mean
fellow
and
that
i
have
some
sense
of
suspicion
and
distrust
being
poor
qualities
in
one
of
my
years
i
know
it
very
well
said
i
i
am
not
more
sure
of
anything
that
a
dear
girl
retorted
richard
and
like
you
because
it
gives
me
comfort
i
had
need
to
get
some
scrap
of
comfort
out
of
all
this
business
for
it
a
bad
one
at
the
best
as
i
have
no
occasion
to
tell
you
i
know
perfectly
said
i
i
know
as
well
richard
what
shall
i
say
as
well
as
you
do
that
such
misconstructions
are
foreign
to
your
nature
and
i
know
as
well
as
you
know
what
so
changes
it
come
sister
come
said
richard
a
little
more
gaily
you
will
be
fair
with
me
at
all
events
if
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
under
that
influence
so
has
he
if
it
has
a
little
twisted
me
it
may
have
a
little
twisted
him
too
i
do
say
that
he
is
not
an
honourable
man
out
of
all
this
complication
and
uncertainty
i
am
sure
he
is
but
it
taints
everybody
you
know
it
taints
everybody
you
have
heard
him
say
so
fifty
times
then
why
should
he
escape
because
said
i
his
is
an
uncommon
character
and
he
has
resolutely
kept
himself
outside
the
circle
richard
oh
because
and
because
replied
richard
in
his
vivacious
way
i
am
not
sure
my
dear
girl
but
that
it
may
be
wise
and
specious
to
preserve
that
outward
indifference
it
may
cause
other
parties
interested
to
become
lax
about
their
interests
and
people
may
die
off
and
points
may
drag
themselves
out
of
memory
and
many
things
may
smoothly
happen
that
are
convenient
enough
i
was
so
touched
with
pity
for
richard
that
i
could
not
reproach
him
any
more
even
by
a
look
i
remembered
my
guardian
gentleness
towards
his
errors
and
with
what
perfect
freedom
from
resentment
he
had
spoken
of
them
esther
richard
resumed
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
i
have
come
here
to
make
underhanded
charges
against
john
jarndyce
i
have
only
come
to
justify
myself
what
i
say
is
it
was
all
very
well
and
we
got
on
very
well
while
i
was
a
boy
utterly
regardless
of
this
same
suit
but
as
soon
as
i
began
to
take
an
interest
in
it
and
to
look
into
it
then
it
was
quite
another
thing
then
john
jarndyce
discovers
that
ada
and
i
must
break
off
and
that
if
i
do
amend
that
very
objectionable
course
i
am
not
fit
for
her
now
esther
i
do
mean
to
amend
that
very
objectionable
course
i
will
not
hold
john
jarndyce
favour
on
those
unfair
terms
of
compromise
which
he
has
no
right
to
dictate
whether
it
pleases
him
or
displeases
him
i
must
maintain
my
rights
and
ada
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
a
good
deal
and
this
is
the
conclusion
i
have
come
to
poor
dear
richard
he
had
indeed
been
thinking
about
it
a
good
deal
his
face
his
voice
his
manner
all
showed
that
too
plainly
so
i
tell
him
honourably
you
are
to
know
i
have
written
to
him
about
all
this
that
we
are
at
issue
and
that
we
had
better
be
at
issue
openly
than
covertly
i
thank
him
for
his
goodwill
and
his
protection
and
he
goes
his
road
and
i
go
mine
the
fact
is
our
roads
are
not
the
same
under
one
of
the
wills
in
dispute
i
should
take
much
more
than
he
i
do
mean
to
say
that
it
is
the
one
to
be
established
but
there
it
is
and
it
has
its
chance
i
have
not
to
learn
from
you
my
dear
richard
said
i
of
your
letter
i
had
heard
of
it
already
without
an
offended
or
angry
word
indeed
replied
richard
softening
i
am
glad
i
said
he
was
an
honourable
man
out
of
all
this
wretched
affair
but
i
always
say
that
and
have
never
doubted
it
now
my
dear
esther
i
know
these
views
of
mine
appear
extremely
harsh
to
you
and
will
to
ada
when
you
tell
her
what
has
passed
between
us
but
if
you
had
gone
into
the
case
as
i
have
if
you
had
only
applied
yourself
to
the
papers
as
i
did
when
i
was
at
kenge
if
you
only
knew
what
an
accumulation
of
charges
and
and
suspicions
and
they
involve
you
would
think
me
moderate
in
comparison
perhaps
so
said
i
but
do
you
think
that
among
those
many
papers
there
is
much
truth
and
justice
richard
there
is
truth
and
justice
somewhere
in
the
case
esther
or
was
once
long
ago
said
i
is
is
must
be
somewhere
pursued
richard
impetuously
and
must
be
brought
out
to
allow
ada
to
be
made
a
bribe
and
of
is
not
the
way
to
bring
it
out
you
say
the
suit
is
changing
me
john
jarndyce
says
it
changes
has
changed
and
will
change
everybody
who
has
any
share
in
it
then
the
greater
right
i
have
on
my
side
when
i
resolve
to
do
all
i
can
to
bring
it
to
an
end
all
you
can
richard
do
you
think
that
in
these
many
years
no
others
have
done
all
they
could
has
the
difficulty
grown
easier
because
of
so
many
failures
it
ca
last
for
ever
returned
richard
with
a
fierceness
kindling
in
him
which
again
presented
to
me
that
last
sad
reminder
i
am
young
and
earnest
and
energy
and
determination
have
done
wonders
many
a
time
others
have
only
half
thrown
themselves
into
it
i
devote
myself
to
it
i
make
it
the
object
of
my
life
oh
richard
my
dear
so
much
the
worse
so
much
the
worse
no
no
no
do
you
be
afraid
for
me
he
returned
affectionately
you
a
dear
good
wise
quiet
blessed
girl
but
you
have
your
prepossessions
so
i
come
round
to
john
jarndyce
i
tell
you
my
good
esther
when
he
and
i
were
on
those
terms
which
he
found
so
convenient
we
were
not
on
natural
terms
are
division
and
animosity
your
natural
terms
richard
no
i
do
say
that
i
mean
that
all
this
business
puts
us
on
unnatural
terms
with
which
natural
relations
are
incompatible
see
another
reason
for
urging
it
on
i
may
find
out
when
it
over
that
i
have
been
mistaken
in
john
jarndyce
my
head
may
be
clearer
when
i
am
free
of
it
and
i
may
then
agree
with
what
you
say
very
well
then
i
shall
acknowledge
it
and
make
him
reparation
everything
postponed
to
that
imaginary
time
everything
held
in
confusion
and
indecision
until
then
now
my
best
of
confidantes
said
richard
i
want
my
cousin
ada
to
understand
that
i
am
not
captious
fickle
and
wilful
about
john
jarndyce
but
that
i
have
this
purpose
and
reason
at
my
back
i
wish
to
represent
myself
to
her
through
you
because
she
has
a
great
esteem
and
respect
for
her
cousin
john
and
i
know
you
will
soften
the
course
i
take
even
though
you
disapprove
of
it
and
and
in
short
said
richard
who
had
been
hesitating
through
these
words
i
i
do
like
to
represent
myself
in
this
litigious
contentious
doubting
character
to
a
confiding
girl
like
ada
i
told
him
that
he
was
more
like
himself
in
those
latter
words
than
in
anything
he
had
said
yet
why
acknowledged
richard
that
may
be
true
enough
my
love
i
rather
feel
it
to
be
so
but
i
shall
be
able
to
give
myself
by
and
by
i
shall
come
all
right
again
then
do
you
be
afraid
i
asked
him
if
this
were
all
he
wished
me
to
tell
ada
not
quite
said
richard
i
am
bound
not
to
withhold
from
her
that
john
jarndyce
answered
my
letter
in
his
usual
manner
addressing
me
as
dear
rick
trying
to
argue
me
out
of
my
opinions
and
telling
me
that
they
should
make
no
difference
in
him
all
very
well
of
course
but
not
altering
the
case
i
also
want
ada
to
know
that
if
i
see
her
seldom
just
now
i
am
looking
after
her
interests
as
well
as
my
own
we
two
being
in
the
same
boat
exactly
and
that
i
hope
she
will
not
suppose
from
any
flying
rumours
she
may
hear
that
i
am
at
all
or
imprudent
on
the
contrary
i
am
always
looking
forward
to
the
termination
of
the
suit
and
always
planning
in
that
direction
being
of
age
now
and
having
taken
the
step
i
have
taken
i
consider
myself
free
from
any
accountability
to
john
jarndyce
but
ada
being
still
a
ward
of
the
court
i
do
yet
ask
her
to
renew
our
engagement
when
she
is
free
to
act
for
herself
i
shall
be
myself
once
more
and
we
shall
both
be
in
very
different
worldly
circumstances
i
believe
if
you
tell
her
all
this
with
the
advantage
of
your
considerate
way
you
will
do
me
a
very
great
and
a
very
kind
service
my
dear
esther
and
i
shall
knock
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
on
the
head
with
greater
vigour
of
course
i
ask
for
no
secrecy
at
bleak
house
richard
said
i
you
place
great
confidence
in
me
but
i
fear
you
will
not
take
advice
from
me
it
impossible
that
i
can
on
this
subject
my
dear
girl
on
any
other
readily
as
if
there
were
any
other
in
his
life
as
if
his
whole
career
and
character
were
not
being
dyed
one
colour
but
i
may
ask
you
a
question
richard
i
think
so
said
he
laughing
i
do
know
who
may
not
if
you
may
not
you
say
yourself
you
are
not
leading
a
very
settled
life
how
can
i
my
dear
esther
with
nothing
settled
are
you
in
debt
again
why
of
course
i
am
said
richard
astonished
at
my
simplicity
is
it
of
course
my
dear
child
certainly
i
ca
throw
myself
into
an
object
so
completely
without
expense
you
forget
or
perhaps
you
do
know
that
under
either
of
the
wills
ada
and
i
take
something
it
only
a
question
between
the
larger
sum
and
the
smaller
i
shall
be
within
the
mark
any
way
bless
your
heart
my
excellent
girl
said
richard
quite
amused
with
me
i
shall
be
all
right
i
shall
pull
through
my
dear
i
felt
so
deeply
sensible
of
the
danger
in
which
he
stood
that
i
tried
in
ada
name
in
my
guardian
in
my
own
by
every
fervent
means
that
i
could
think
of
to
warn
him
of
it
and
to
show
him
some
of
his
mistakes
he
received
everything
i
said
with
patience
and
gentleness
but
it
all
rebounded
from
him
without
taking
the
least
effect
i
could
not
wonder
at
this
after
the
reception
his
preoccupied
mind
had
given
to
my
guardian
letter
but
i
determined
to
try
ada
influence
yet
so
when
our
walk
brought
us
round
to
the
village
again
and
i
went
home
to
breakfast
i
prepared
ada
for
the
account
i
was
going
to
give
her
and
told
her
exactly
what
reason
we
had
to
dread
that
richard
was
losing
himself
and
scattering
his
whole
life
to
the
winds
it
made
her
very
unhappy
of
course
though
she
had
a
far
far
greater
reliance
on
his
correcting
his
errors
than
i
could
have
which
was
so
natural
and
loving
in
my
dear
and
she
presently
wrote
him
this
little
letter
my
dearest
cousin
esther
has
told
me
all
you
said
to
her
this
morning
i
write
this
to
repeat
most
earnestly
for
myself
all
that
she
said
to
you
and
to
let
you
know
how
sure
i
am
that
you
will
sooner
or
later
find
our
cousin
john
a
pattern
of
truth
sincerity
and
goodness
when
you
will
deeply
deeply
grieve
to
have
done
him
without
intending
it
so
much
wrong
i
do
not
quite
know
how
to
write
what
i
wish
to
say
next
but
i
trust
you
will
understand
it
as
i
mean
it
i
have
some
fears
my
dearest
cousin
that
it
may
be
partly
for
my
sake
you
are
now
laying
up
so
much
unhappiness
for
yourself
and
if
for
yourself
for
me
in
case
this
should
be
so
or
in
case
you
should
entertain
much
thought
of
me
in
what
you
are
doing
i
most
earnestly
entreat
and
beg
you
to
desist
you
can
do
nothing
for
my
sake
that
will
make
me
half
so
happy
as
for
ever
turning
your
back
upon
the
shadow
in
which
we
both
were
born
do
not
be
angry
with
me
for
saying
this
pray
pray
dear
richard
for
my
sake
and
for
your
own
and
in
a
natural
repugnance
for
that
source
of
trouble
which
had
its
share
in
making
us
both
orphans
when
we
were
very
young
pray
pray
let
it
go
for
ever
we
have
reason
to
know
by
this
time
that
there
is
no
good
in
it
and
no
hope
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
got
from
it
but
sorrow
my
dearest
cousin
it
is
needless
for
me
to
say
that
you
are
quite
free
and
that
it
is
very
likely
you
may
find
some
one
whom
you
will
love
much
better
than
your
first
fancy
i
am
quite
sure
if
you
will
let
me
say
so
that
the
object
of
your
choice
would
greatly
prefer
to
follow
your
fortunes
far
and
wide
however
moderate
or
poor
and
see
you
happy
doing
your
duty
and
pursuing
your
chosen
way
than
to
have
the
hope
of
being
or
even
to
be
very
rich
with
you
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
at
the
cost
of
dragging
years
of
procrastination
and
anxiety
and
of
your
indifference
to
other
aims
you
may
wonder
at
my
saying
this
so
confidently
with
so
little
knowledge
or
experience
but
i
know
it
for
a
certainty
from
my
own
heart
ever
my
dearest
cousin
your
most
affectionate
ada
this
note
brought
richard
to
us
very
soon
but
it
made
little
change
in
him
if
any
we
would
fairly
try
he
said
who
was
right
and
who
was
wrong
he
would
show
us
we
should
see
he
was
animated
and
glowing
as
if
ada
tenderness
had
gratified
him
but
i
could
only
hope
with
a
sigh
that
the
letter
might
have
some
stronger
effect
upon
his
mind
on
than
it
assuredly
had
then
as
they
were
to
remain
with
us
that
day
and
had
taken
their
places
to
return
by
the
coach
next
morning
i
sought
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
skimpole
our
life
easily
threw
one
in
my
way
and
i
delicately
said
that
there
was
a
responsibility
in
encouraging
richard
responsibility
my
dear
miss
summerson
he
repeated
catching
at
the
word
with
the
pleasantest
smile
i
am
the
last
man
in
the
world
for
such
a
thing
i
never
was
responsible
in
my
life
i
ca
be
i
am
afraid
everybody
is
obliged
to
be
said
i
timidly
enough
he
being
so
much
older
and
more
clever
than
i
no
really
said
skimpole
receiving
this
new
light
with
a
most
agreeable
jocularity
of
surprise
but
every
man
not
obliged
to
be
solvent
i
am
not
i
never
was
see
my
dear
miss
summerson
he
took
a
handful
of
loose
silver
and
halfpence
from
his
pocket
there
so
much
money
i
have
not
an
idea
how
much
i
have
not
the
power
of
counting
call
it
four
and
ninepence
call
it
four
pound
nine
they
tell
me
i
owe
more
than
that
i
dare
say
i
do
i
dare
say
i
owe
as
much
as
people
will
let
me
owe
if
they
do
stop
why
should
i
there
you
have
harold
skimpole
in
little
if
responsibility
i
am
responsible
the
perfect
ease
of
manner
with
which
he
put
the
money
up
again
and
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
on
his
refined
face
as
if
he
had
been
mentioning
a
curious
little
fact
about
somebody
else
almost
made
me
feel
as
if
he
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
now
when
you
mention
responsibility
he
resumed
i
am
disposed
to
say
that
i
never
had
the
happiness
of
knowing
any
one
whom
i
should
consider
so
refreshingly
responsible
as
yourself
you
appear
to
me
to
be
the
very
touchstone
of
responsibility
when
i
see
you
my
dear
miss
summerson
intent
upon
the
perfect
working
of
the
whole
little
orderly
system
of
which
you
are
the
centre
i
feel
inclined
to
say
to
myself
in
fact
i
do
say
to
myself
very
often
responsibility
it
was
difficult
after
this
to
explain
what
i
meant
but
i
persisted
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
all
hoped
he
would
check
and
not
confirm
richard
in
the
sanguine
views
he
entertained
just
then
most
willingly
he
retorted
if
i
could
but
my
dear
miss
summerson
i
have
no
art
no
disguise
if
he
takes
me
by
the
hand
and
leads
me
through
westminster
hall
in
an
airy
procession
after
fortune
i
must
go
if
he
says
join
the
dance
i
must
join
it
common
sense
would
i
know
but
i
have
no
common
sense
it
was
very
unfortunate
for
richard
i
said
do
you
think
so
returned
skimpole
do
say
that
do
say
that
let
us
suppose
him
keeping
company
with
common
sense
an
excellent
man
a
good
deal
wrinkled
dreadfully
practical
change
for
a
note
in
every
pocket
ruled
in
his
hand
say
upon
the
whole
resembling
a
our
dear
richard
sanguine
ardent
overleaping
obstacles
bursting
with
poetry
like
a
young
bud
says
to
this
highly
respectable
companion
see
a
golden
prospect
before
me
it
very
bright
it
very
beautiful
it
very
joyous
here
i
go
bounding
over
the
landscape
to
come
at
it
the
respectable
companion
instantly
knocks
him
down
with
the
ruled
tells
him
in
a
literal
prosaic
way
that
he
sees
no
such
thing
shows
him
it
nothing
but
fees
fraud
horsehair
wigs
and
black
gowns
now
you
know
that
a
painful
change
sensible
in
the
last
degree
i
have
no
doubt
but
disagreeable
i
ca
do
it
i
have
got
the
ruled
i
have
none
of
the
elements
in
my
composition
i
am
not
at
all
respectable
and
i
do
want
to
be
odd
perhaps
but
so
it
is
it
was
idle
to
say
more
so
i
proposed
that
we
should
join
ada
and
richard
who
were
a
little
in
advance
and
i
gave
up
skimpole
in
despair
he
had
been
over
the
hall
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
whimsically
described
the
family
pictures
as
we
walked
there
were
such
portentous
shepherdesses
among
the
ladies
dedlock
dead
and
gone
he
told
us
that
peaceful
crooks
became
weapons
of
assault
in
their
hands
they
tended
their
flocks
severely
in
buckram
and
powder
and
put
their
patches
on
to
terrify
commoners
as
the
chiefs
of
some
other
tribes
put
on
their
there
was
a
sir
somebody
dedlock
with
a
battle
a
volumes
of
smoke
flashes
of
lightning
a
town
on
fire
and
a
stormed
fort
all
in
full
action
between
his
horse
two
hind
legs
showing
he
supposed
how
little
a
dedlock
made
of
such
trifles
the
whole
race
he
represented
as
having
evidently
been
in
life
what
he
called
stuffed
people
a
large
collection
glassy
eyed
set
up
in
the
most
approved
manner
on
their
various
twigs
and
perches
very
correct
perfectly
free
from
animation
and
always
in
glass
cases
i
was
not
so
easy
now
during
any
reference
to
the
name
but
that
i
felt
it
a
relief
when
richard
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
hurried
away
to
meet
a
stranger
whom
he
first
descried
coming
slowly
towards
us
dear
me
said
skimpole
vholes
we
asked
if
that
were
a
friend
of
richard
friend
and
legal
adviser
said
skimpole
now
my
dear
miss
summerson
if
you
want
common
sense
responsibility
and
respectability
all
united
if
you
want
an
exemplary
man
vholes
is
the
man
we
had
not
known
we
said
that
richard
was
assisted
by
any
gentleman
of
that
name
when
he
emerged
from
legal
infancy
returned
skimpole
he
parted
from
our
conversational
friend
kenge
and
took
up
i
believe
with
vholes
indeed
i
know
he
did
because
i
introduced
him
to
vholes
had
you
known
him
long
asked
ada
vholes
my
dear
miss
clare
i
had
had
that
kind
of
acquaintance
with
him
which
i
have
had
with
several
gentlemen
of
his
profession
he
had
done
something
or
other
in
a
very
agreeable
civil
manner
taken
proceedings
i
think
is
the
expression
which
ended
in
the
proceeding
of
his
taking
me
somebody
was
so
good
as
to
step
in
and
pay
the
money
something
and
fourpence
was
the
amount
i
forget
the
pounds
and
shillings
but
i
know
it
ended
with
fourpence
because
it
struck
me
at
the
time
as
being
so
odd
that
i
could
owe
anybody
fourpence
and
after
that
i
brought
them
together
vholes
asked
me
for
the
introduction
and
i
gave
it
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
he
looked
inquiringly
at
us
with
his
frankest
smile
as
he
made
the
discovery
vholes
bribed
me
perhaps
he
gave
me
something
and
called
it
commission
was
it
a
note
do
you
know
i
think
it
must
have
been
a
note
his
further
consideration
of
the
point
was
prevented
by
coming
back
to
us
in
an
excited
state
and
hastily
representing
vholes
a
sallow
man
with
pinched
lips
that
looked
as
if
they
were
cold
a
red
eruption
here
and
there
upon
his
face
tall
and
thin
about
fifty
years
of
age
and
stooping
dressed
in
black
and
buttoned
to
the
chin
there
was
nothing
so
remarkable
in
him
as
a
lifeless
manner
and
a
slow
fixed
way
he
had
of
looking
at
richard
i
hope
i
do
disturb
you
ladies
said
vholes
and
now
i
observed
that
he
was
further
remarkable
for
an
inward
manner
of
speaking
i
arranged
with
carstone
that
he
should
always
know
when
his
cause
was
in
the
chancellor
paper
and
being
informed
by
one
of
my
clerks
last
night
after
post
time
that
it
stood
rather
unexpectedly
in
the
paper
for
i
put
myself
into
the
coach
early
this
morning
and
came
down
to
confer
with
him
yes
said
richard
flushed
and
looking
triumphantly
at
ada
and
me
we
do
do
these
things
in
the
old
slow
way
now
we
spin
along
now
vholes
we
must
hire
something
to
get
over
to
the
post
town
in
and
catch
the
mail
and
go
up
by
it
anything
you
please
sir
returned
vholes
i
am
quite
at
your
service
let
me
see
said
richard
looking
at
his
watch
if
i
run
down
to
the
dedlock
and
get
my
portmanteau
fastened
up
and
order
a
gig
or
a
chaise
or
whatever
to
be
got
we
shall
have
an
hour
then
before
starting
i
come
back
to
tea
cousin
ada
will
you
and
esther
take
care
of
vholes
when
i
am
gone
he
was
away
directly
in
his
heat
and
hurry
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
dusk
of
evening
we
who
were
left
walked
on
towards
the
house
is
carstone
presence
necessary
sir
said
i
can
it
do
any
good
no
miss
vholes
replied
i
am
not
aware
that
it
can
both
ada
and
i
expressed
our
regret
that
he
should
go
then
only
to
be
disappointed
carstone
has
laid
down
the
principle
of
watching
his
own
interests
said
vholes
and
when
a
client
lays
down
his
own
principle
and
it
is
not
immoral
it
devolves
upon
me
to
carry
it
out
i
wish
in
business
to
be
exact
and
open
i
am
a
widower
with
three
daughters
emma
jane
and
caroline
and
my
desire
is
so
to
discharge
the
duties
of
life
as
to
leave
them
a
good
name
this
appears
to
be
a
pleasant
spot
miss
the
remark
being
made
to
me
in
consequence
of
my
being
next
him
as
we
walked
i
assented
and
enumerated
its
chief
attractions
indeed
said
vholes
i
have
the
privilege
of
supporting
an
aged
father
in
the
vale
of
taunton
his
native
place
and
i
admire
that
country
very
much
i
had
no
idea
there
was
anything
so
attractive
here
to
keep
up
the
conversation
i
asked
vholes
if
he
would
like
to
live
altogether
in
the
country
there
miss
said
he
you
touch
me
on
a
tender
string
my
health
is
not
good
my
digestion
being
much
impaired
and
if
i
had
only
myself
to
consider
i
should
take
refuge
in
rural
habits
especially
as
the
cares
of
business
have
prevented
me
from
ever
coming
much
into
contact
with
general
society
and
particularly
with
ladies
society
which
i
have
most
wished
to
mix
in
but
with
my
three
daughters
emma
jane
and
caroline
and
my
aged
father
i
can
not
afford
to
be
selfish
it
is
true
i
have
no
longer
to
maintain
a
dear
grandmother
who
died
in
her
hundred
and
second
year
but
enough
remains
to
render
it
indispensable
that
the
mill
should
be
always
going
it
required
some
attention
to
hear
him
on
account
of
his
inward
speaking
and
his
lifeless
manner
you
will
excuse
my
having
mentioned
my
daughters
he
said
they
are
my
weak
point
i
wish
to
leave
the
poor
girls
some
little
independence
as
well
as
a
good
name
we
now
arrived
at
boythorn
house
where
the
all
prepared
was
awaiting
us
richard
came
in
restless
and
hurried
shortly
afterwards
and
leaning
over
vholes
chair
whispered
something
in
his
ear
vholes
replied
aloud
or
as
nearly
aloud
i
suppose
as
he
had
ever
replied
to
anything
you
will
drive
me
will
you
sir
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
sir
anything
you
please
i
am
quite
at
your
service
we
understood
from
what
followed
that
skimpole
was
to
be
left
until
the
morning
to
occupy
the
two
places
which
had
been
already
paid
for
as
ada
and
i
were
both
in
low
spirits
concerning
richard
and
very
sorry
so
to
part
with
him
we
made
it
as
plain
as
we
politely
could
that
we
should
leave
skimpole
to
the
dedlock
arms
and
retire
when
the
were
gone
richard
high
spirits
carrying
everything
before
them
we
all
went
out
together
to
the
top
of
the
hill
above
the
village
where
he
had
ordered
a
gig
to
wait
and
where
we
found
a
man
with
a
lantern
standing
at
the
head
of
the
gaunt
pale
horse
that
had
been
harnessed
to
it
i
never
shall
forget
those
two
seated
side
by
side
in
the
light
richard
all
flush
and
fire
and
laughter
with
the
reins
in
his
hand
vholes
quite
still
and
buttoned
up
looking
at
him
as
if
he
were
looking
at
his
prey
and
charming
it
i
have
before
me
the
whole
picture
of
the
warm
dark
night
the
summer
lightning
the
dusty
track
of
road
closed
in
by
hedgerows
and
high
trees
the
gaunt
pale
horse
with
his
ears
pricked
up
and
the
driving
away
at
speed
to
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
my
dear
girl
told
me
that
night
how
richard
being
thereafter
prosperous
or
ruined
befriended
or
deserted
could
only
make
this
difference
to
her
that
the
more
he
needed
love
from
one
unchanging
heart
the
more
love
that
unchanging
heart
would
have
to
give
him
how
he
thought
of
her
through
his
present
errors
and
she
would
think
of
him
at
all
times
never
of
herself
if
she
could
devote
herself
to
him
never
of
her
own
delights
if
she
could
minister
to
his
and
she
kept
her
word
i
look
along
the
road
before
me
where
the
distance
already
shortens
and
the
journey
end
is
growing
visible
and
true
and
good
above
the
dead
sea
of
the
chancery
suit
and
all
the
ashy
fruit
it
cast
ashore
i
think
i
see
my
darling
chapter
xxxviii
a
struggle
when
our
time
came
for
returning
to
bleak
house
again
we
were
punctual
to
the
day
and
were
received
with
an
overpowering
welcome
i
was
perfectly
restored
to
health
and
strength
and
finding
my
housekeeping
keys
laid
ready
for
me
in
my
room
rang
myself
in
as
if
i
had
been
a
new
year
with
a
merry
little
peal
once
more
duty
duty
esther
said
i
and
if
you
are
not
overjoyed
to
do
it
more
than
cheerfully
and
contentedly
through
anything
and
everything
you
ought
to
be
that
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
my
dear
the
first
few
mornings
were
mornings
of
so
much
bustle
and
business
devoted
to
such
settlements
of
accounts
such
repeated
journeys
to
and
fro
between
the
growlery
and
all
other
parts
of
the
house
so
many
rearrangements
of
drawers
and
presses
and
such
a
general
new
beginning
altogether
that
i
had
not
a
moment
leisure
but
when
these
arrangements
were
completed
and
everything
was
in
order
i
paid
a
visit
of
a
few
hours
to
london
which
something
in
the
letter
i
had
destroyed
at
chesney
wold
had
induced
me
to
decide
upon
in
my
own
mind
i
made
caddy
jellyby
her
maiden
name
was
so
natural
to
me
that
i
always
called
her
by
it
the
pretext
for
this
visit
and
wrote
her
a
note
previously
asking
the
favour
of
her
company
on
a
little
business
expedition
leaving
home
very
early
in
the
morning
i
got
to
london
by
in
such
good
time
that
i
got
to
newman
street
with
the
day
before
me
caddy
who
had
not
seen
me
since
her
was
so
glad
and
so
affectionate
that
i
was
half
inclined
to
fear
i
should
make
her
husband
jealous
but
he
was
in
his
way
just
as
bad
i
mean
as
good
and
in
short
it
was
the
old
story
and
nobody
would
leave
me
any
possibility
of
doing
anything
meritorious
the
elder
turveydrop
was
in
bed
i
found
and
caddy
was
milling
his
chocolate
which
a
melancholy
little
boy
who
was
an
apprentice
it
seemed
such
a
curious
thing
to
be
apprenticed
to
the
trade
of
dancing
was
waiting
to
carry
upstairs
her
was
extremely
kind
and
considerate
caddy
told
me
and
they
lived
most
happily
together
when
she
spoke
of
their
living
together
she
meant
that
the
old
gentleman
had
all
the
good
things
and
all
the
good
lodging
while
she
and
her
husband
had
what
they
could
get
and
were
poked
into
two
corner
rooms
over
the
mews
and
how
is
your
mama
caddy
said
i
why
i
hear
of
her
esther
replied
caddy
through
pa
but
i
see
very
little
of
her
we
are
good
friends
i
am
glad
to
say
but
ma
thinks
there
is
something
absurd
in
my
having
married
a
and
she
is
rather
afraid
of
its
extending
to
her
it
struck
me
that
if
jellyby
had
discharged
her
own
natural
duties
and
obligations
before
she
swept
the
horizon
with
a
telescope
in
search
of
others
she
would
have
taken
the
best
precautions
against
becoming
absurd
but
i
need
scarcely
observe
that
i
kept
this
to
myself
and
your
papa
caddy
he
comes
here
every
evening
returned
caddy
and
is
so
fond
of
sitting
in
the
corner
there
that
it
a
treat
to
see
him
looking
at
the
corner
i
plainly
perceived
the
mark
of
head
against
the
wall
it
was
consolatory
to
know
that
he
had
found
such
a
for
it
and
you
caddy
said
i
you
are
always
busy
i
be
bound
well
my
dear
returned
caddy
i
am
indeed
for
to
tell
you
a
grand
secret
i
am
qualifying
myself
to
give
lessons
prince
health
is
not
strong
and
i
want
to
be
able
to
assist
him
what
with
schools
and
classes
here
and
private
pupils
and
the
apprentices
he
really
has
too
much
to
do
poor
fellow
the
notion
of
the
apprentices
was
still
so
odd
to
me
that
i
asked
caddy
if
there
were
many
of
them
four
said
caddy
one
and
three
out
they
are
very
good
children
only
when
they
get
together
they
will
play
instead
of
attending
to
their
work
so
the
little
boy
you
saw
just
now
waltzes
by
himself
in
the
empty
kitchen
and
we
distribute
the
others
over
the
house
as
well
as
we
can
that
is
only
for
their
steps
of
course
said
i
only
for
their
steps
said
caddy
in
that
way
they
practise
so
many
hours
at
a
time
whatever
steps
they
happen
to
be
upon
they
dance
in
the
academy
and
at
this
time
of
year
we
do
figures
at
five
every
morning
why
what
a
laborious
life
i
exclaimed
i
assure
you
my
dear
returned
caddy
smiling
when
the
apprentices
ring
us
up
in
the
morning
the
bell
rings
into
our
room
not
to
disturb
old
turveydrop
and
when
i
put
up
the
window
and
see
them
standing
on
the
with
their
little
pumps
under
their
arms
i
am
actually
reminded
of
the
sweeps
all
this
presented
the
art
to
me
in
a
singular
light
to
be
sure
caddy
enjoyed
the
effect
of
her
communication
and
cheerfully
recounted
the
particulars
of
her
own
studies
you
see
my
dear
to
save
expense
i
ought
to
know
something
of
the
piano
and
i
ought
to
know
something
of
the
kit
too
and
consequently
i
have
to
practise
those
two
instruments
as
well
as
the
details
of
our
profession
if
ma
had
been
like
anybody
else
i
might
have
had
some
little
musical
knowledge
to
begin
upon
however
i
had
any
and
that
part
of
the
work
is
at
first
a
little
discouraging
i
must
allow
but
i
have
a
very
good
ear
and
i
am
used
to
drudgery
i
have
to
thank
ma
for
that
at
all
events
and
where
there
a
will
a
way
you
know
esther
the
world
over
saying
these
words
caddy
laughingly
sat
down
at
a
little
jingling
square
piano
and
really
rattled
off
a
quadrille
with
great
spirit
then
she
and
blushingly
got
up
again
and
while
she
still
laughed
herself
said
do
laugh
at
me
please
that
a
dear
girl
i
would
sooner
have
cried
but
i
did
neither
i
encouraged
her
and
praised
her
with
all
my
heart
for
i
conscientiously
believed
wife
though
she
was
and
though
in
her
limited
ambition
she
aspired
to
be
she
had
struck
out
a
natural
wholesome
loving
course
of
industry
and
perseverance
that
was
quite
as
good
as
a
mission
my
dear
said
caddy
delighted
you
ca
think
how
you
cheer
me
i
shall
owe
you
you
do
know
how
much
what
changes
esther
even
in
my
small
world
you
recollect
that
first
night
when
i
was
so
unpolite
and
inky
who
would
have
thought
then
of
my
ever
teaching
people
to
dance
of
all
other
possibilities
and
impossibilities
her
husband
who
had
left
us
while
we
had
this
chat
now
coming
back
preparatory
to
exercising
the
apprentices
in
the
caddy
informed
me
she
was
quite
at
my
disposal
but
it
was
not
my
time
yet
i
was
glad
to
tell
her
for
i
should
have
been
vexed
to
take
her
away
then
therefore
we
three
adjourned
to
the
apprentices
together
and
i
made
one
in
the
dance
the
apprentices
were
the
queerest
little
people
besides
the
melancholy
boy
who
i
hoped
had
not
been
made
so
by
waltzing
alone
in
the
empty
kitchen
there
were
two
other
boys
and
one
dirty
little
limp
girl
in
a
gauzy
dress
such
a
precocious
little
girl
with
such
a
dowdy
bonnet
on
that
too
of
a
gauzy
texture
who
brought
her
sandalled
shoes
in
an
old
threadbare
velvet
reticule
such
mean
little
boys
when
they
were
not
dancing
with
string
and
marbles
and
in
their
pockets
and
the
most
untidy
legs
and
feet
and
heels
particularly
i
asked
caddy
what
had
made
their
parents
choose
this
profession
for
them
caddy
said
she
did
know
perhaps
they
were
designed
for
teachers
perhaps
for
the
stage
they
were
all
people
in
humble
circumstances
and
the
melancholy
boy
mother
kept
a
shop
we
danced
for
an
hour
with
great
gravity
the
melancholy
child
doing
wonders
with
his
lower
extremities
in
which
there
appeared
to
be
some
sense
of
enjoyment
though
it
never
rose
above
his
waist
caddy
while
she
was
observant
of
her
husband
and
was
evidently
founded
upon
him
had
acquired
a
grace
and
of
her
own
which
united
to
her
pretty
face
and
figure
was
uncommonly
agreeable
she
already
relieved
him
of
much
of
the
instruction
of
these
young
people
and
he
seldom
interfered
except
to
walk
his
part
in
the
figure
if
he
had
anything
to
do
in
it
he
always
played
the
tune
the
affectation
of
the
gauzy
child
and
her
condescension
to
the
boys
was
a
sight
and
thus
we
danced
an
hour
by
the
clock
when
the
practice
was
concluded
caddy
husband
made
himself
ready
to
go
out
of
town
to
a
school
and
caddy
ran
away
to
get
ready
to
go
out
with
me
i
sat
in
the
in
the
interval
contemplating
the
apprentices
the
two
boys
went
upon
the
staircase
to
put
on
their
and
pull
the
boy
hair
as
i
judged
from
the
nature
of
his
objections
returning
with
their
jackets
buttoned
and
their
pumps
stuck
in
them
they
then
produced
packets
of
cold
bread
and
meat
and
bivouacked
under
a
painted
lyre
on
the
wall
the
little
gauzy
child
having
whisked
her
sandals
into
the
reticule
and
put
on
a
pair
of
shoes
shook
her
head
into
the
dowdy
bonnet
at
one
shake
and
answering
my
inquiry
whether
she
liked
dancing
by
replying
not
with
boys
tied
it
across
her
chin
and
went
home
contemptuous
old
turveydrop
is
so
sorry
said
caddy
that
he
has
not
finished
dressing
yet
and
can
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
you
go
you
are
such
a
favourite
of
his
esther
i
expressed
myself
much
obliged
to
him
but
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
add
that
i
readily
dispensed
with
this
attention
it
takes
him
a
long
time
to
dress
said
caddy
because
he
is
very
much
looked
up
to
in
such
things
you
know
and
has
a
reputation
to
support
you
ca
think
how
kind
he
is
to
pa
he
talks
to
pa
of
an
evening
about
the
prince
regent
and
i
never
saw
pa
so
interested
there
was
something
in
the
picture
of
turveydrop
bestowing
his
deportment
on
jellyby
that
quite
took
my
fancy
i
asked
caddy
if
he
brought
her
papa
out
much
no
said
caddy
i
do
know
that
he
does
that
but
he
talks
to
pa
and
pa
greatly
admires
him
and
listens
and
likes
it
of
course
i
am
aware
that
pa
has
hardly
any
claims
to
deportment
but
they
get
on
together
delightfully
you
ca
think
what
good
companions
they
make
i
never
saw
pa
take
snuff
before
in
my
life
but
he
takes
one
pinch
out
of
turveydrop
box
regularly
and
keeps
putting
it
to
his
nose
and
taking
it
away
again
all
the
evening
that
old
turveydrop
should
ever
in
the
chances
and
changes
of
life
have
come
to
the
rescue
of
jellyby
from
appeared
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
pleasantest
of
oddities
as
to
peepy
said
caddy
with
a
little
hesitation
whom
i
was
most
afraid
of
next
to
having
any
family
of
my
own
esther
as
an
inconvenience
to
turveydrop
the
kindness
of
the
old
gentleman
to
that
child
is
beyond
everything
he
asks
to
see
him
my
dear
he
lets
him
take
the
newspaper
up
to
him
in
bed
he
gives
him
the
crusts
of
his
toast
to
eat
he
sends
him
on
little
errands
about
the
house
he
tells
him
to
come
to
me
for
sixpences
in
short
said
caddy
cheerily
and
not
to
prose
i
am
a
very
fortunate
girl
and
ought
to
be
very
grateful
where
are
we
going
esther
to
the
old
street
road
said
i
where
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
the
solicitor
clerk
who
was
sent
to
meet
me
at
the
on
the
very
day
when
i
came
to
london
and
first
saw
you
my
dear
now
i
think
of
it
the
gentleman
who
brought
us
to
your
house
then
indeed
i
seem
to
be
naturally
the
person
to
go
with
you
returned
caddy
to
the
old
street
road
we
went
and
there
inquired
at
residence
for
guppy
guppy
occupying
the
parlours
and
having
indeed
been
visibly
in
danger
of
cracking
herself
like
a
nut
in
the
door
by
peeping
out
before
she
was
asked
for
immediately
presented
herself
and
requested
us
to
walk
in
she
was
an
old
lady
in
a
large
cap
with
rather
a
red
nose
and
rather
an
unsteady
eye
but
smiling
all
over
her
close
little
was
prepared
for
a
visit
and
there
was
a
portrait
of
her
son
in
it
which
i
had
almost
written
here
was
more
like
than
life
it
insisted
upon
him
with
such
obstinacy
and
was
so
determined
not
to
let
him
off
not
only
was
the
portrait
there
but
we
found
the
original
there
too
he
was
dressed
in
a
great
many
colours
and
was
discovered
at
a
table
reading
with
his
forefinger
to
his
forehead
miss
summerson
said
guppy
rising
this
is
indeed
an
oasis
mother
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
put
a
chair
for
the
other
lady
and
get
out
of
the
gangway
guppy
whose
incessant
smiling
gave
her
quite
a
waggish
appearance
did
as
her
son
requested
and
then
sat
down
in
a
corner
holding
her
pocket
handkerchief
to
her
chest
like
a
fomentation
with
both
hands
i
presented
caddy
and
guppy
said
that
any
friend
of
mine
was
more
than
welcome
i
then
proceeded
to
the
object
of
my
visit
i
took
the
liberty
of
sending
you
a
note
sir
said
guppy
acknowledged
the
receipt
by
taking
it
out
of
his
putting
it
to
his
lips
and
returning
it
to
his
pocket
with
a
bow
guppy
mother
was
so
diverted
that
she
rolled
her
head
as
she
smiled
and
made
a
silent
appeal
to
caddy
with
her
elbow
could
i
speak
to
you
alone
for
a
moment
said
i
anything
like
the
jocoseness
of
guppy
mother
just
now
i
think
i
never
saw
she
made
no
sound
of
laughter
but
she
rolled
her
head
and
shook
it
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
and
appealed
to
caddy
with
her
elbow
and
her
hand
and
her
shoulder
and
was
so
unspeakably
entertained
altogether
that
it
was
with
some
difficulty
she
could
marshal
caddy
through
the
little
into
her
bedroom
adjoining
miss
summerson
said
guppy
you
will
excuse
the
waywardness
of
a
parent
ever
mindful
of
a
son
appiness
my
mother
though
highly
exasperating
to
the
feelings
is
actuated
by
maternal
dictates
i
could
hardly
have
believed
that
anybody
could
in
a
moment
have
turned
so
red
or
changed
so
much
as
guppy
did
when
i
now
put
up
my
veil
i
asked
the
favour
of
seeing
you
for
a
few
moments
here
said
i
in
preference
to
calling
at
kenge
because
remembering
what
you
said
on
an
occasion
when
you
spoke
to
me
in
confidence
i
feared
i
might
otherwise
cause
you
some
embarrassment
mr
guppy
i
caused
him
embarrassment
enough
as
it
was
i
am
sure
i
never
saw
such
faltering
such
confusion
such
amazement
and
apprehension
miss
summerson
stammered
guppy
i
i
beg
your
pardon
but
in
our
profession
we
we
find
it
necessary
to
be
explicit
you
have
referred
to
an
occasion
miss
when
i
when
i
did
myself
the
honour
of
making
a
declaration
which
something
seemed
to
rise
in
his
throat
that
he
could
not
possibly
swallow
he
put
his
hand
there
coughed
made
faces
tried
again
to
swallow
it
coughed
again
made
faces
again
looked
all
round
the
room
and
fluttered
his
papers
a
kind
of
giddy
sensation
has
come
upon
me
miss
he
explained
which
rather
knocks
me
over
i
er
a
little
subject
to
this
sort
of
thing
er
by
george
i
gave
him
a
little
time
to
recover
he
consumed
it
in
putting
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
taking
it
away
again
and
in
backing
his
chair
into
the
corner
behind
him
my
intention
was
to
remark
miss
said
guppy
dear
me
something
bronchial
i
think
hem
to
remark
that
you
was
so
good
on
that
occasion
as
to
repel
and
repudiate
that
declaration
you
you
would
perhaps
object
to
admit
that
though
no
witnesses
are
present
it
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
to
your
mind
if
you
was
to
put
in
that
admission
there
can
be
no
doubt
said
i
that
i
declined
your
proposal
without
any
reservation
or
qualification
whatever
mr
guppy
thank
you
miss
he
returned
measuring
the
table
with
his
troubled
hands
so
far
that
satisfactory
and
it
does
you
credit
er
this
is
certainly
bronchial
must
be
in
the
tubes
er
you
perhaps
be
offended
if
i
was
to
mention
not
that
it
necessary
for
your
own
good
sense
or
any
person
sense
must
show
that
if
i
was
to
mention
that
such
declaration
on
my
part
was
final
and
there
terminated
i
quite
understand
that
said
i
perhaps
er
it
may
not
be
worth
the
form
but
it
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
your
mind
perhaps
you
would
object
to
admit
that
miss
said
guppy
i
admit
it
most
fully
and
freely
said
i
thank
you
returned
guppy
very
honourable
i
am
sure
i
regret
that
my
arrangements
in
life
combined
with
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
will
put
it
out
of
my
power
ever
to
fall
back
upon
that
offer
or
to
renew
it
in
any
shape
or
form
whatever
but
it
will
ever
be
a
retrospect
entwined
er
with
bowers
guppy
bronchitis
came
to
his
relief
and
stopped
his
measurement
of
the
table
i
may
now
perhaps
mention
what
i
wished
to
say
to
you
i
began
i
shall
be
honoured
i
am
sure
said
guppy
i
am
so
persuaded
that
your
own
good
sense
and
right
feeling
miss
will
will
keep
you
as
square
as
possible
that
i
can
have
nothing
but
pleasure
i
am
sure
in
hearing
any
observations
you
may
wish
to
offer
you
were
so
good
as
to
imply
on
that
occasion
excuse
me
miss
said
guppy
but
we
had
better
not
travel
out
of
the
record
into
implication
i
can
not
admit
that
i
implied
anything
you
said
on
that
occasion
i
recommenced
that
you
might
possibly
have
the
means
of
advancing
my
interests
and
promoting
my
fortunes
by
making
discoveries
of
which
i
should
be
the
subject
i
presume
that
you
founded
that
belief
upon
your
general
knowledge
of
my
being
an
orphan
girl
indebted
for
everything
to
the
benevolence
of
jarndyce
now
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
what
i
have
come
to
beg
of
you
is
guppy
that
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
relinquish
all
idea
of
so
serving
me
i
have
thought
of
this
sometimes
and
i
have
thought
of
it
most
lately
since
i
have
been
at
length
i
have
decided
in
case
you
should
at
any
time
recall
that
purpose
and
act
upon
it
in
any
way
to
come
to
you
and
assure
you
that
you
are
altogether
mistaken
you
could
make
no
discovery
in
reference
to
me
that
would
do
me
the
least
service
or
give
me
the
least
pleasure
i
am
acquainted
with
my
personal
history
and
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
assure
you
that
you
never
can
advance
my
welfare
by
such
means
you
may
perhaps
have
abandoned
this
project
a
long
time
if
so
excuse
my
giving
you
unnecessary
trouble
if
not
i
entreat
you
on
the
assurance
i
have
given
you
henceforth
to
lay
it
aside
i
beg
you
to
do
this
for
my
peace
i
am
bound
to
confess
said
guppy
that
you
express
yourself
miss
with
that
good
sense
and
right
feeling
for
which
i
gave
you
credit
nothing
can
be
more
satisfactory
than
such
right
feeling
and
if
i
mistook
any
intentions
on
your
part
just
now
i
am
prepared
to
tender
a
full
apology
i
should
wish
to
be
understood
miss
as
hereby
offering
that
apology
limiting
it
as
your
own
good
sense
and
right
feeling
will
point
out
the
necessity
of
to
the
present
proceedings
i
must
say
for
guppy
that
the
snuffling
manner
he
had
had
upon
him
improved
very
much
he
seemed
truly
glad
to
be
able
to
do
something
i
asked
and
he
looked
ashamed
if
you
will
allow
me
to
finish
what
i
have
to
say
at
once
so
that
i
may
have
no
occasion
to
resume
i
went
on
seeing
him
about
to
speak
you
will
do
me
a
kindness
sir
i
come
to
you
as
privately
as
possible
because
you
announced
this
impression
of
yours
to
me
in
a
confidence
which
i
have
really
wished
to
respect
and
which
i
always
have
respected
as
you
remember
i
have
mentioned
my
illness
there
really
is
no
reason
why
i
should
hesitate
to
say
that
i
know
very
well
that
any
little
delicacy
i
might
have
had
in
making
a
request
to
you
is
quite
removed
therefore
i
make
the
entreaty
i
have
now
preferred
and
i
hope
you
will
have
sufficient
consideration
for
me
to
accede
to
it
i
must
do
guppy
the
further
justice
of
saying
that
he
had
looked
more
and
more
ashamed
and
that
he
looked
most
ashamed
and
very
earnest
when
he
now
replied
with
a
burning
face
upon
my
word
and
honour
upon
my
life
upon
my
soul
miss
summerson
as
i
am
a
living
man
i
act
according
to
your
wish
i
never
go
another
step
in
opposition
to
it
i
take
my
oath
to
it
if
it
will
be
any
satisfaction
to
you
in
what
i
promise
at
this
present
time
touching
the
matters
now
in
question
continued
guppy
rapidly
as
if
he
were
repeating
a
familiar
form
of
words
i
speak
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
i
am
quite
satisfied
said
i
rising
at
this
point
and
i
thank
you
very
much
caddy
my
dear
i
am
ready
guppy
mother
returned
with
caddy
now
making
me
the
recipient
of
her
silent
laughter
and
her
nudges
and
we
took
our
leave
guppy
saw
us
to
the
door
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
either
imperfectly
awake
or
walking
in
his
sleep
and
we
left
him
there
staring
but
in
a
minute
he
came
after
us
down
the
street
without
any
hat
and
with
his
long
hair
all
blown
about
and
stopped
us
saying
fervently
miss
summerson
upon
my
honour
and
soul
you
may
depend
upon
me
i
do
said
i
quite
confidently
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
said
guppy
going
with
one
leg
and
staying
with
the
other
but
this
lady
being
present
your
own
witness
it
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
your
mind
which
i
should
wish
to
set
at
rest
if
you
was
to
repeat
those
admissions
well
caddy
said
i
turning
to
her
perhaps
you
will
not
be
surprised
when
i
tell
you
my
dear
that
there
never
has
been
any
engagement
no
proposal
or
promise
of
marriage
whatsoever
suggested
guppy
no
proposal
or
promise
of
marriage
whatsoever
said
i
between
this
gentleman
william
guppy
of
penton
place
pentonville
in
the
county
of
middlesex
he
murmured
between
this
gentleman
william
guppy
of
penton
place
pentonville
in
the
county
of
middlesex
and
myself
thank
you
miss
said
guppy
very
full
er
excuse
me
name
christian
and
surname
both
i
gave
them
married
woman
i
believe
said
guppy
married
woman
thank
you
formerly

jellyby
spinster
then
of
thavies
inn
within
the
city
of
london
but
now
of
newman
street
oxford
street
much
obliged
he
ran
home
and
came
running
back
again
touching
that
matter
you
know
i
really
and
truly
am
very
sorry
that
my
arrangements
in
life
combined
with
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
should
prevent
a
renewal
of
what
was
wholly
terminated
some
time
back
said
guppy
to
me
forlornly
and
despondently
but
it
could
be
now
could
it
you
know
i
only
put
it
to
you
i
replied
it
certainly
could
not
the
subject
did
not
admit
of
a
doubt
he
thanked
me
and
ran
to
his
mother
again
and
back
again
it
very
honourable
of
you
miss
i
am
sure
said
guppy
if
an
altar
could
be
erected
in
the
bowers
of
friendship
but
upon
my
soul
you
may
rely
upon
me
in
every
respect
save
and
except
the
tender
passion
only
the
struggle
in
guppy
breast
and
the
numerous
oscillations
it
occasioned
him
between
his
mother
door
and
us
were
sufficiently
conspicuous
in
the
windy
street
particularly
as
his
hair
wanted
cutting
to
make
us
hurry
away
i
did
so
with
a
lightened
heart
but
when
we
last
looked
back
guppy
was
still
oscillating

the
same
troubled
state

respectable

have
made

another
mark
of

the
one
great

of

there

principle
distinctly
certainly

consistently
maintained
through
all
its
narrow
turnings
viewed
by

it
becomes
a
coherent

not
the
monstrous

the

apt
to
think
it

them
but
once
clearly
perceive
that
its
grand
principle
is
to
make
business
for
itself
at
their
expense
and
surely
they
will
cease
to
grumble
but
not
perceiving
this
quite
plainly
only
seeing
it
by
halves
in
a
confused
way
the
laity
sometimes
suffer
in
peace
and
pocket
with
a
bad
grace
and
do
grumble
very
much
then
this
respectability
of
vholes
is
brought
into
powerful
play
against
them
repeal
this
statute
my
good
sir
says
kenge
to
a
smarting
client
repeal
it
my
dear
sir
never
with
my
consent
alter
this
law
sir
and
what
will
be
the
effect
of
your
rash
proceeding
on
a
class
of
practitioners
very
worthily
represented
allow
me
to
say
to
you
by
the
opposite
attorney
in
the
case
vholes
sir
that
class
of
practitioners
would
be
swept
from
the
face
of
the
earth
now
you
can
not
afford
i
will
say
the
social
system
can
not
afford
to
lose
an
order
of
men
like
vholes
diligent
persevering
steady
acute
in
business
my
dear
sir
i
understand
your
present
feelings
against
the
existing
state
of
things
which
i
grant
to
be
a
little
hard
in
your
case
but
i
can
never
raise
my
voice
for
the
demolition
of
a
class
of
men
like
mr
vholes
the
respectability
of
vholes
has
even
been
cited
with
crushing
effect
before
parliamentary
committees
as
in
the
following
blue
minutes
of
a
distinguished
evidence
question
number
five
hundred
and
seventeen
thousand
eight
hundred
and
if
i
understand
you
these
forms
of
practice
indisputably
occasion
delay
answer
yes
some
delay
question
and
great
expense
answer
most
assuredly
they
can
not
be
gone
through
for
nothing
question
and
unspeakable
vexation
answer
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
they
have
never
given
me
any
vexation
quite
the
contrary
question
but
you
think
that
their
abolition
would
damage
a
class
of
practitioners
answer
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
question
can
you
instance
any
type
of
that
class
answer
yes
i
would
unhesitatingly
mention
vholes
he
would
be
ruined
question
vholes
is
considered
in
the
profession
a
respectable
man
answer
which
proved
fatal
to
the
inquiry
for
ten
years
vholes
is
considered
in
the
profession
a
most
respectable
man
so
in
familiar
conversation
private
authorities
no
less
disinterested
will
remark
that
they
do
know
what
this
age
is
coming
to
that
we
are
plunging
down
precipices
that
now
here
is
something
else
gone
that
these
changes
are
death
to
people
like
vholes
a
man
of
undoubted
respectability
with
a
father
in
the
vale
of
taunton
and
three
daughters
at
home
take
a
few
steps
more
in
this
direction
say
they
and
what
is
to
become
of
vholes
father
is
he
to
perish
and
of
vholes
daughters
are
they
to
be
or
governesses
as
though
vholes
and
his
relations
being
minor
cannibal
chiefs
and
it
being
proposed
to
abolish
cannibalism
indignant
champions
were
to
put
the
case
thus
make
unlawful
and
you
starve
the
vholeses
in
a
word
vholes
with
his
three
daughters
and
his
father
in
the
vale
of
taunton
is
continually
doing
duty
like
a
piece
of
timber
to
shore
up
some
decayed
foundation
that
has
become
a
pitfall
and
a
nuisance
and
with
a
great
many
people
in
a
great
many
instances
the
question
is
never
one
of
a
change
from
wrong
to
right
which
is
quite
an
extraneous
consideration
but
is
always
one
of
injury
or
advantage
to
that
eminently
respectable
legion
vholes
the
chancellor
is
within
these
ten
minutes
up
for
the
long
vacation
vholes
and
his
young
client
and
several
blue
bags
hastily
stuffed
out
of
all
regularity
of
form
as
the
larger
sort
of
serpents
are
in
their
first
gorged
state
have
returned
to
the
official
den
vholes
quiet
and
unmoved
as
a
man
of
so
much
respectability
ought
to
be
takes
off
his
close
black
gloves
as
if
he
were
skinning
his
hands
lifts
off
his
tight
hat
as
if
he
were
scalping
himself
and
sits
down
at
his
desk
the
client
throws
his
hat
and
gloves
upon
the
ground
tosses
them
anywhere
without
looking
after
them
or
caring
where
they
go
flings
himself
into
a
chair
half
sighing
and
half
groaning
rests
his
aching
head
upon
his
hand
and
looks
the
portrait
of
young
despair
again
nothing
done
says
richard
nothing
nothing
done
do
say
nothing
done
sir
returns
the
placid
vholes
that
is
scarcely
fair
sir
scarcely
fair
why
what
is
done
says
richard
turning
gloomily
upon
him
that
may
not
be
the
whole
question
returns
vholes
the
question
may
branch
off
into
what
is
doing
what
is
doing
and
what
is
doing
asks
the
moody
client
vholes
sitting
with
his
arms
on
the
desk
quietly
bringing
the
tips
of
his
five
right
fingers
to
meet
the
tips
of
his
five
left
fingers
and
quietly
separating
them
again
and
fixedly
and
slowly
looking
at
his
client
replies
a
good
deal
is
doing
sir
we
have
put
our
shoulders
to
the
wheel
carstone
and
the
wheel
is
going
round
yes
with
ixion
on
it
how
am
i
to
get
through
the
next
four
or
five
accursed
months
exclaims
the
young
man
rising
from
his
chair
and
walking
about
the
room
returns
vholes
following
him
close
with
his
eyes
wherever
he
goes
your
spirits
are
hasty
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
on
your
account
excuse
me
if
i
recommend
you
not
to
chafe
so
much
not
to
be
so
impetuous
not
to
wear
yourself
out
so
you
should
have
more
patience
you
should
sustain
yourself
better
i
ought
to
imitate
you
in
fact
mr
vholes
says
richard
sitting
down
again
with
an
impatient
laugh
and
beating
the
devil
tattoo
with
his
boot
on
the
patternless
carpet
sir
returns
vholes
always
looking
at
the
client
as
if
he
were
making
a
lingering
meal
of
him
with
his
eyes
as
well
as
with
his
professional
appetite
sir
returns
vholes
with
his
inward
manner
of
speech
and
his
bloodless
quietude
i
should
not
have
had
the
presumption
to
propose
myself
as
a
model
for
your
imitation
or
any
man
let
me
but
leave
the
good
name
to
my
three
daughters
and
that
is
enough
for
me
i
am
not
a
but
since
you
mention
me
so
pointedly
i
will
acknowledge
that
i
should
like
to
impart
to
you
a
little
of
my
come
sir
you
are
disposed
to
call
it
insensibility
and
i
am
sure
i
have
no
objection
say
insensibility
a
little
of
my
insensibility
vholes
explains
the
client
somewhat
abashed
i
had
no
intention
to
accuse
you
of
insensibility
i
think
you
had
sir
without
knowing
it
returns
the
equable
vholes
very
naturally
it
is
my
duty
to
attend
to
your
interests
with
a
cool
head
and
i
can
quite
understand
that
to
your
excited
feelings
i
may
appear
at
such
times
as
the
present
insensible
my
daughters
may
know
me
better
my
aged
father
may
know
me
better
but
they
have
known
me
much
longer
than
you
have
and
the
confiding
eye
of
affection
is
not
the
distrustful
eye
of
business
not
that
i
complain
sir
of
the
eye
of
business
being
distrustful
quite
the
contrary
in
attending
to
your
interests
i
wish
to
have
all
possible
checks
upon
me
it
is
right
that
i
should
have
them
i
court
inquiry
but
your
interests
demand
that
i
should
be
cool
and
methodical
carstone
and
i
can
not
be
otherwise
no
sir
not
even
to
please
you
vholes
after
glancing
at
the
official
cat
who
is
patiently
watching
a
mouse
hole
fixes
his
charmed
gaze
again
on
his
young
client
and
proceeds
in
his
voice
as
if
there
were
an
unclean
spirit
in
him
that
will
neither
come
out
nor
speak
out
what
are
you
to
do
sir
you
inquire
during
the
vacation
i
should
hope
you
gentlemen
of
the
army
may
find
many
means
of
amusing
yourselves
if
you
give
your
minds
to
it
if
you
had
asked
me
what
i
was
to
do
during
the
vacation
i
could
have
answered
you
more
readily
i
am
to
attend
to
your
interests
i
am
to
be
found
here
day
by
day
attending
to
your
interests
that
is
my
duty
and
or
vacation
makes
no
difference
to
me
if
you
wish
to
consult
me
as
to
your
interests
you
will
find
me
here
at
all
times
alike
other
professional
men
go
out
of
town
i
do
not
that
i
blame
them
for
going
i
merely
say
i
do
go
this
desk
is
your
rock
sir
vholes
gives
it
a
rap
and
it
sounds
as
hollow
as
a
coffin
not
to
richard
though
there
is
encouragement
in
the
sound
to
him
perhaps
vholes
knows
there
is
i
am
perfectly
aware
vholes
says
richard
more
familiarly
and
that
you
are
the
most
reliable
fellow
in
the
world
and
that
to
have
to
do
with
you
is
to
have
to
do
with
a
man
of
business
who
is
not
to
be
hoodwinked
but
put
yourself
in
my
case
dragging
on
this
dislocated
life
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
difficulty
every
day
continually
hoping
and
continually
disappointed
conscious
of
change
upon
change
for
the
worse
in
myself
and
of
no
change
for
the
better
in
anything
else
and
you
will
find
it
a
case
sometimes
as
i
do
you
know
says
vholes
that
i
never
give
hopes
sir
i
told
you
from
the
first
that
i
never
give
hopes
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
greater
part
of
the
costs
comes
out
of
the
estate
i
should
not
be
considerate
of
my
good
name
if
i
gave
hopes
it
might
seem
as
if
costs
were
my
object
still
when
you
say
there
is
no
change
for
the
better
i
must
as
a
bare
matter
of
fact
deny
that
aye
returns
richard
brightening
but
how
do
you
make
it
out
carstone
you
are
represented
by
you
said
just
now
a
rock
yes
sir
says
vholes
gently
shaking
his
head
and
rapping
the
hollow
desk
with
a
sound
as
if
ashes
were
falling
on
ashes
and
dust
on
dust
a
rock
that
something
you
are
separately
represented
and
no
longer
hidden
and
lost
in
the
interests
of
others
something
the
suit
does
not
sleep
we
wake
it
up
we
air
it
we
walk
it
about
that
something
it
not
all
jarndyce
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
that
something
nobody
has
it
all
his
own
way
now
sir
and
that
something
surely
richard
his
face
flushing
suddenly
strikes
the
desk
with
his
clenched
hand
vholes
if
any
man
had
told
me
when
i
first
went
to
john
jarndyce
house
that
he
was
anything
but
the
disinterested
friend
he
seemed
that
he
was
what
he
has
gradually
turned
out
to
be
i
could
have
found
no
words
strong
enough
to
repel
the
slander
i
could
not
have
defended
him
too
ardently
so
little
did
i
know
of
the
world
whereas
now
i
do
declare
to
you
that
he
becomes
to
me
the
embodiment
of
the
suit
that
in
place
of
its
being
an
abstraction
it
is
john
jarndyce
that
the
more
i
suffer
the
more
indignant
i
am
with
him
that
every
new
delay
and
every
new
disappointment
is
only
a
new
injury
from
john
jarndyce
hand
no
no
says
vholes
do
say
so
we
ought
to
have
patience
all
of
us
besides
i
never
disparage
sir
i
never
disparage
vholes
returns
the
angry
client
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
he
would
have
strangled
the
suit
if
he
could
he
was
not
active
in
it
vholes
admits
with
an
appearance
of
reluctance
he
certainly
was
not
active
in
it
but
however
but
however
he
might
have
had
amiable
intentions
who
can
read
the
heart
mr
you
can
returns
richard
i
mr
well
enough
to
know
what
his
intentions
were
are
or
are
not
our
interests
conflicting
tell
me
that
says
richard
accompanying
his
last
three
words
with
three
raps
on
his
rock
of
trust
returns
vholes
immovable
in
attitude
and
never
winking
his
hungry
eyes
i
should
be
wanting
in
my
duty
as
your
professional
adviser
i
should
be
departing
from
my
fidelity
to
your
interests
if
i
represented
those
interests
as
identical
with
the
interests
of
jarndyce
they
are
no
such
thing
sir
i
never
impute
motives
i
both
have
and
am
a
father
and
i
never
impute
motives
but
i
must
not
shrink
from
a
professional
duty
even
if
it
sows
dissensions
in
families
i
understand
you
to
be
now
consulting
me
professionally
as
to
your
interests
you
are
so
i
reply
then
they
are
not
identical
with
those
of
mr
jarndyce
of
course
they
are
not
cries
richard
you
found
that
out
long
ago
returns
vholes
i
wish
to
say
no
more
of
any
third
party
than
is
necessary
i
wish
to
leave
my
good
name
unsullied
together
with
any
little
property
of
which
i
may
become
possessed
through
industry
and
perseverance
to
my
daughters
emma
jane
and
caroline
i
also
desire
to
live
in
amity
with
my
professional
brethren
when
skimpole
did
me
the
honour
sir
i
will
not
say
the
very
high
honour
for
i
never
stoop
to
flattery
of
bringing
us
together
in
this
room
i
mentioned
to
you
that
i
could
offer
no
opinion
or
advice
as
to
your
interests
while
those
interests
were
entrusted
to
another
member
of
the
profession
and
i
spoke
in
such
terms
as
i
was
bound
to
speak
of
kenge
and
carboy
office
which
stands
high
you
sir
thought
fit
to
withdraw
your
interests
from
that
keeping
nevertheless
and
to
offer
them
to
me
you
brought
them
with
clean
hands
sir
and
i
accepted
them
with
clean
hands
those
interests
are
now
paramount
in
this
office
my
digestive
functions
as
you
may
have
heard
me
mention
are
not
in
a
good
state
and
rest
might
improve
them
but
i
shall
not
rest
sir
while
i
am
your
representative
whenever
you
want
me
you
will
find
me
here
summon
me
anywhere
and
i
will
come
during
the
long
vacation
sir
i
shall
devote
my
leisure
to
studying
your
interests
more
and
more
closely
and
to
making
arrangements
for
moving
heaven
and
earth
including
of
course
the
chancellor
after
michaelmas
term
and
when
i
ultimately
congratulate
you
sir
says
vholes
with
the
severity
of
a
determined
man
when
i
ultimately
congratulate
you
sir
with
all
my
heart
on
your
accession
to
fortune
which
but
that
i
never
give
hopes
i
might
say
something
further
about
you
will
owe
me
nothing
beyond
whatever
little
balance
may
be
then
outstanding
of
the
costs
as
between
solicitor
and
client
not
included
in
the
taxed
costs
allowed
out
of
the
estate
i
pretend
to
no
claim
upon
you
but
for
the
zealous
and
active
discharge
not
the
languid
and
routine
discharge
sir
that
much
credit
i
stipulate
for
of
my
professional
duty
my
duty
prosperously
ended
all
between
us
is
ended
vholes
finally
adds
by
way
of
rider
to
this
declaration
of
his
principles
that
as
carstone
is
about
to
rejoin
his
regiment
perhaps
will
favour
him
with
an
order
on
his
agent
for
twenty
pounds
on
account
for
there
have
been
many
little
consultations
and
attendances
of
late
sir
observes
vholes
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
diary
and
these
things
mount
up
and
i
do
profess
to
be
a
man
of
capital
when
we
first
entered
on
our
present
relations
i
stated
to
you
openly
it
is
a
principle
of
mine
that
there
never
can
be
too
much
openness
between
solicitor
and
client
that
i
was
not
a
man
of
capital
and
that
if
capital
was
your
object
you
had
better
leave
your
papers
in
kenge
office
no
you
will
find
none
of
the
advantages
or
disadvantages
of
capital
here
sir
this
vholes
gives
the
desk
one
hollow
blow
again
is
your
rock
it
pretends
to
be
nothing
more
the
client
with
his
dejection
insensibly
relieved
and
his
vague
hopes
rekindled
takes
pen
and
ink
and
writes
the
draft
not
without
perplexed
consideration
and
calculation
of
the
date
it
may
bear
implying
scant
effects
in
the
agent
hands
all
the
while
vholes
buttoned
up
in
body
and
mind
looks
at
him
attentively
all
the
while
vholes
official
cat
watches
the
mouse
hole
lastly
the
client
shaking
hands
beseeches
vholes
for
sake
and
earth
sake
to
do
his
utmost
to
pull
him
through
the
court
of
chancery
vholes
who
never
gives
hopes
lays
his
palm
upon
the
client
shoulder
and
answers
with
a
smile
always
here
sir
personally
or
by
letter
you
will
always
find
me
here
sir
with
my
shoulder
to
the
wheel
thus
they
part
and
vholes
left
alone
employs
himself
in
carrying
sundry
little
matters
out
of
his
diary
into
his
draft
bill
book
for
the
ultimate
behoof
of
his
three
daughters
so
might
an
industrious
fox
or
bear
make
up
his
account
of
chickens
or
stray
travellers
with
an
eye
to
his
cubs
not
to
disparage
by
that
word
the
three
lank
and
maidens
who
dwell
with
the
parent
vholes
in
an
earthy
cottage
situated
in
a
damp
garden
at
kennington
richard
emerging
from
the
heavy
shade
of
symond
inn
into
the
sunshine
of
chancery
lane
for
there
happens
to
be
sunshine
there
walks
thoughtfully
on
and
turns
into
lincoln
inn
and
passes
under
the
shadow
of
the
lincoln
inn
trees
on
many
such
loungers
have
the
speckled
shadows
of
those
trees
often
fallen
on
the
like
bent
head
the
bitten
nail
the
lowering
eye
the
lingering
step
the
purposeless
and
dreamy
air
the
good
consuming
and
consumed
the
life
turned
sour
this
lounger
is
not
shabby
yet
but
that
may
come
chancery
which
knows
no
wisdom
but
in
precedent
is
very
rich
in
such
precedents
and
why
should
one
be
different
from
ten
thousand
yet
the
time
is
so
short
since
his
depreciation
began
that
as
he
saunters
away
reluctant
to
leave
the
spot
for
some
long
months
together
though
he
hates
it
richard
himself
may
feel
his
own
case
as
if
it
were
a
startling
one
while
his
heart
is
heavy
with
corroding
care
suspense
distrust
and
doubt
it
may
have
room
for
some
sorrowful
wonder
when
he
recalls
how
different
his
first
visit
there
how
different
he
how
different
all
the
colours
of
his
mind
but
injustice
breeds
injustice
the
fighting
with
shadows
and
being
defeated
by
them
necessitates
the
setting
up
of
substances
to
combat
from
the
impalpable
suit
which
no
man
alive
can
understand
the
time
for
that
being
long
gone
by
it
has
become
a
gloomy
relief
to
turn
to
the
palpable
figure
of
the
friend
who
would
have
saved
him
from
this
ruin
and
make
him
his
enemy
richard
has
told
vholes
the
truth
is
he
in
a
hardened
or
a
softened
mood
he
still
lays
his
injuries
equally
at
that
door
he
was
thwarted
in
that
quarter
of
a
set
purpose
and
that
purpose
could
only
originate
in
the
one
subject
that
is
resolving
his
existence
into
itself
besides
it
is
a
justification
to
him
in
his
own
eyes
to
have
an
embodied
antagonist
and
oppressor
is
richard
a
monster
in
all
this
or
would
chancery
be
found
rich
in
such
precedents
too
if
they
could
be
got
for
citation
from
the
recording
angel
two
pairs
of
eyes
not
unused
to
such
people
look
after
him
as
biting
his
nails
and
brooding
he
crosses
the
square
and
is
swallowed
up
by
the
shadow
of
the
southern
gateway
guppy
and
weevle
are
the
possessors
of
those
eyes
and
they
have
been
leaning
in
conversation
against
the
low
stone
parapet
under
the
trees
he
passes
close
by
them
seeing
nothing
but
the
ground
william
says
weevle
adjusting
his
whiskers
combustion
going
on
there
it
not
a
case
of
spontaneous
but
smouldering
combustion
it
is
ah
says
guppy
he
would
keep
out
of
jarndyce
and
i
suppose
he
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
i
never
knew
much
of
him
he
was
as
high
as
the
monument
when
he
was
on
trial
at
our
place
a
good
riddance
to
me
whether
as
clerk
or
client
well
tony
that
as
i
was
mentioning
is
what
they
up
to
guppy
refolding
his
arms
resettles
himself
against
the
parapet
as
resuming
a
conversation
of
interest
they
are
still
up
to
it
sir
says
guppy
still
taking
stock
still
examining
papers
still
going
over
the
heaps
and
heaps
of
rubbish
at
this
rate
they
be
at
it
these
seven
years
and
small
is
helping
small
left
us
at
a
week
notice
told
kenge
his
business
was
too
much
for
the
old
gentleman
and
he
could
better
himself
by
undertaking
it
there
had
been
a
coolness
between
myself
and
small
on
account
of
his
being
so
close
but
he
said
you
and
i
began
it
and
as
he
had
me
there
for
we
did
i
put
our
acquaintance
on
the
old
footing
that
how
i
come
to
know
what
they
up
to
you
have
looked
in
at
all
tony
says
guppy
a
little
disconcerted
to
be
unreserved
with
you
i
do
greatly
relish
the
house
except
in
your
company
and
therefore
i
have
not
and
therefore
i
proposed
this
little
appointment
for
our
fetching
away
your
things
there
goes
the
hour
by
the
clock
tony
guppy
becomes
mysteriously
and
tenderly
eloquent
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
impress
upon
your
mind
once
more
that
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
have
made
a
melancholy
alteration
in
my
most
cherished
plans
and
in
that
unrequited
image
which
i
formerly
mentioned
to
you
as
a
friend
that
image
is
shattered
and
that
idol
is
laid
low
my
only
wish
now
in
connexion
with
the
objects
which
i
had
an
idea
of
carrying
out
in
the
court
with
your
aid
as
a
friend
is
to
let
alone
and
bury
in
oblivion
do
you
think
it
possible
do
you
think
it
at
all
likely
i
put
it
to
you
tony
as
a
friend
from
your
knowledge
of
that
capricious
and
deep
old
character
who
fell
a
prey
to
the
spontaneous
element
do
you
tony
think
it
at
all
likely
that
on
second
thoughts
he
put
those
letters
away
anywhere
after
you
saw
him
alive
and
that
they
were
not
destroyed
that
night
weevle
reflects
for
some
time
shakes
his
head
decidedly
thinks
not
tony
says
guppy
as
they
walk
towards
the
court
once
again
understand
me
as
a
friend
without
entering
into
further
explanations
i
may
repeat
that
the
idol
is
down
i
have
no
purpose
to
serve
now
but
burial
in
oblivion
to
that
i
have
pledged
myself
i
owe
it
to
myself
and
i
owe
it
to
the
shattered
image
as
also
to
the
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
if
you
was
to
express
to
me
by
a
gesture
by
a
wink
that
you
saw
lying
anywhere
in
your
late
lodgings
any
papers
that
so
much
as
looked
like
the
papers
in
question
i
would
pitch
them
into
the
fire
sir
on
my
own
responsibility
weevle
nods
guppy
much
elevated
in
his
own
opinion
by
having
delivered
these
observations
with
an
air
in
part
forensic
and
in
part
romantic
this
gentleman
having
a
passion
for
conducting
anything
in
the
form
of
an
examination
or
delivering
anything
in
the
form
of
a
summing
up
or
a
speech
accompanies
his
friend
with
dignity
to
the
court
never
since
it
has
been
a
court
has
it
had
such
a
fortunatus
purse
of
gossip
as
in
the
proceedings
at
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
regularly
every
morning
at
eight
is
the
elder
smallweed
brought
down
to
the
corner
and
carried
in
accompanied
by
smallweed
judy
and
bart
and
regularly
all
day
do
they
all
remain
there
until
nine
at
night
solaced
by
gipsy
dinners
not
abundant
in
quantity
from
the
cook
shop
rummaging
and
searching
digging
delving
and
diving
among
the
treasures
of
the
late
lamented
what
those
treasures
are
they
keep
so
secret
that
the
court
is
maddened
in
its
delirium
it
imagines
guineas
pouring
out
of
overflowing
old
chairs
and
mattresses
stuffed
with
bank
of
england
notes
it
possesses
itself
of
the
sixpenny
history
with
highly
coloured
folding
frontispiece
of
daniel
dancer
and
his
sister
and
also
of
elwes
of
suffolk
and
transfers
all
the
facts
from
those
authentic
narratives
to
krook
twice
when
the
dustman
is
called
in
to
carry
off
a
cartload
of
old
paper
ashes
and
broken
bottles
the
whole
court
assembles
and
pries
into
the
baskets
as
they
come
forth
many
times
the
two
gentlemen
who
write
with
the
ravenous
little
pens
on
the

seen
prowling
in
the
neighbourhood
shy
of
each
other
their
late
partnership
being
dissolved
the
sol
skilfully
carries
a
vein
of
the
prevailing
interest
through
the
harmonic
nights
little
swills
in
what
are
professionally
known
as
patter
allusions
to
the
subject
is
received
with
loud
applause
and
the

gags
in
the
regular
business
like
a
man
inspired
even
miss
melvilleson
in
the
revived
caledonian
melody
of

points
the
sentiment
that
the
dogs
love
broo
whatever
the
nature
of
that
refreshment
may
be
with
such
archness
and
such
a
turn
of
the
head
towards
next
door
that
she
is
immediately
understood
to
mean
smallweed
loves
to
find
money
and
is
nightly
honoured
with
a
double
encore
for
all
this
the
court
discovers
nothing
and
as
piper
and
perkins
now
communicate
to
the
late
lodger
whose
appearance
is
the
signal
for
a
general
rally
it
is
in
one
continual
ferment
to
discover
everything
and
more

and
guppy
with
every
eye
in
the
court
head
upon
them
knock
at
the
closed
door
of
the
late
lamented
house
in
a
high
state
of
popularity
but
being
contrary
to
the
expectation
admitted
they
immediately
become
unpopular
and
are
considered
to
mean
no
good
the
shutters
are
more
or
less
closed
all
over
the
house
and
the
is
sufficiently
dark
to
require
candles
introduced
into
the
back
shop
by
smallweed
the
younger
they
fresh
from
the
sunlight
can
at
first
see
nothing
save
darkness
and
shadows
but
they
gradually
discern
the
elder
smallweed
seated
in
his
chair
upon
the
brink
of
a
well
or
grave
of
the
virtuous
judy
groping
therein
like
a
female
sexton
and
smallweed
on
the
level
ground
in
the
vicinity
snowed
up
in
a
heap
of
paper
fragments
print
and
manuscript
which
would
appear
to
be
the
accumulated
compliments
that
have
been
sent
flying
at
her
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
whole
party
small
included
are
blackened
with
dust
and
dirt
and
present
a
fiendish
appearance
not
relieved
by
the
general
aspect
of
the
room
there
is
more
litter
and
lumber
in
it
than
of
old
and
it
is
dirtier
if
possible
likewise
it
is
ghostly
with
traces
of
its
dead
inhabitant
and
even
with
his
chalked
writing
on
the
wall
on
the
entrance
of
visitors
smallweed
and
judy
simultaneously
fold
their
arms
and
stop
in
their
researches
aha
croaks
the
old
gentleman
how
de
do
gentlemen
how
de
do
come
to
fetch
your
property
weevle
that
well
that
well
ha
ha
we
should
have
been
forced
to
sell
you
up
sir
to
pay
your
warehouse
room
if
you
had
left
it
here
much
longer
you
feel
quite
at
home
here
again
i
dare
say
glad
to
see
you
glad
to
see
you
weevle
thanking

casts
an
eye
about
guppy

comes
back
without
any
new
intelligence
in
it
guppy
eye
comes
back
and
meets
smallweed
eye
that
engaging
old
gentleman
is
still
murmuring
like
some
instrument
running
down
how
de
do
sir
how
de
how
and
then
having
run
down
he
lapses
into
grinning
silence
as
guppy
starts
at
seeing
tulkinghorn
standing
in
the
darkness
opposite
with
his
hands
behind
him
gentleman
so
kind
as
to
act
as
my
solicitor
says
grandfather
smallweed
i
am
not
the
sort
of
client
for
a
gentleman
of
such
note
but
he
is
so
good
guppy
slightly
nudging
his
friend
to
take
another
look
makes
a
shuffling
bow
to
tulkinghorn
who
returns
it
with
an
easy
nod
tulkinghorn
is
looking
on
as
if
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
were
rather
amused
by
the
novelty
a
good
deal
of
property
here
sir
i
should
say
guppy
observes
to
smallweed
principally
rags
and
rubbish
my
dear
friend
rags
and
rubbish
me
and
bart
and
my
granddaughter
judy
are
endeavouring
to
make
out
an
inventory
of
what
worth
anything
to
sell
but
we
have
come
to
much
as
yet
we
have
come
to
hah
smallweed
has
run
down
again
while
weevle
eye
attended
by
guppy
eye
has
again
gone
round
the
room
and
come
back
well
sir
says
weevle
we
wo
intrude
any
longer
if
allow
us
to
go
upstairs
anywhere
my
dear
sir
anywhere
you
at
home
make
yourself
so
pray
as
they
go
upstairs
guppy
lifts
his
eyebrows
inquiringly
and
looks
at
tony
tony
shakes
his
head
they
find
the
old
room
very
dull
and
dismal
with
the
ashes
of
the
fire
that
was
burning
on
that
memorable
night
yet
in
the
discoloured
grate
they
have
a
great
disinclination
to
touch
any
object
and
carefully
blow
the
dust
from
it
first
nor
are
they
desirous
to
prolong
their
visit
packing
the
few
movables
with
all
possible
speed
and
never
speaking
above
a
whisper
look
here
says
tony
recoiling
here
that
horrible
cat
coming
in
guppy
retreats
behind
a
chair
small
told
me
of
her
she
went
leaping
and
bounding
and
tearing
about
that
night
like
a
dragon
and
got
out
on
the
and
roamed
about
up
there
for
a
fortnight
and
then
came
tumbling
down
the
chimney
very
thin
did
you
ever
see
such
a
brute
looks
as
if
she
knew
all
about
it
do
she
almost
looks
as
if
she
was
krook
shoohoo
get
out
you
goblin
lady
jane
in
the
doorway
with
her
tiger
snarl
from
ear
to
ear
and
her
club
of
a
tail
shows
no
intention
of
obeying
but
tulkinghorn
stumbling
over
her
she
spits
at
his
rusty
legs
and
swearing
wrathfully
takes
her
arched
back
upstairs
possibly
to
roam
the
again
and
return
by
the
chimney
guppy
says
tulkinghorn
could
i
have
a
word
with
you
guppy
is
engaged
in
collecting
the
galaxy
gallery
of
british
beauty
from
the
wall
and
depositing
those
works
of
art
in
their
old
ignoble
sir
he
returns
reddening
i
wish
to
act
with
courtesy
towards
every
member
of
the
profession
and
especially
i
am
sure
towards
a
member
of
it
so
well
known
as
yourself
i
will
truly
add
sir
so
distinguished
as
yourself
still
tulkinghorn
sir
i
must
stipulate
that
if
you
have
any
word
with
me
that
word
is
spoken
in
the
presence
of
my
friend
oh
indeed
says
tulkinghorn
yes
sir
my
reasons
are
not
of
a
personal
nature
at
all
but
they
are
amply
sufficient
for
myself
no
doubt
no
doubt
tulkinghorn
is
as
imperturbable
as
the
hearthstone
to
which
he
has
quietly
walked
the
matter
is
not
of
that
consequence
that
i
need
put
you
to
the
trouble
of
making
any
conditions
mr
guppy
he
pauses
here
to
smile
and
his
smile
is
as
dull
and
rusty
as
his
pantaloons
you
are
to
be
congratulated
guppy
you
are
a
fortunate
young
man
sir
pretty
well
so
tulkinghorn
i
do
complain
complain
high
friends
free
admission
to
great
houses
and
access
to
elegant
ladies
why
guppy
there
are
people
in
london
who
would
give
their
ears
to
be
you
guppy
looking
as
if
he
would
give
his
own
reddening
and
still
reddening
ears
to
be
one
of
those
people
at
present
instead
of
himself
replies
sir
if
i
attend
to
my
profession
and
do
what
is
right
by
kenge
and
carboy
my
friends
and
acquaintances
are
of
no
consequence
to
them
nor
to
any
member
of
the
profession
not
excepting
tulkinghorn
of
the
fields
i
am
not
under
any
obligation
to
explain
myself
further
and
with
all
respect
for
you
sir
and
without
offence
i
repeat
without
offence
oh
certainly
i
do
intend
to
do
it
quite
so
says
tulkinghorn
with
a
calm
nod
very
good
i
see
by
these
portraits
that
you
take
a
strong
interest
in
the
fashionable
great
sir
he
addresses
this
to
the
astounded
tony
who
admits
the
soft
impeachment
a
virtue
in
which
few
englishmen
are
deficient
observes
tulkinghorn
he
has
been
standing
on
the
hearthstone
with
his
back
to
the
smoked
and
now
turns
round
with
his
glasses
to
his
eyes
who
is
this
dedlock
ha
a
very
good
likeness
in
its
way
but
it
wants
force
of
character
good
day
to
you
gentlemen
good
day
when
he
has
walked
out
guppy
in
a
great
perspiration
nerves
himself
to
the
hasty
completion
of
the
taking
down
of
the
galaxy
gallery
concluding
with
lady
dedlock
tony
he
says
hurriedly
to
his
astonished
companion
let
us
be
quick
in
putting
the
things
together
and
in
getting
out
of
this
place
it
were
in
vain
longer
to
conceal
from
you
tony
that
between
myself
and
one
of
the
members
of
a
aristocracy
whom
i
now
hold
in
my
hand
there
has
been
undivulged
communication
and
association
the
time
might
have
been
when
i
might
have
revealed
it
to
you
it
never
will
be
more
it
is
due
alike
to
the
oath
i
have
taken
alike
to
the
shattered
idol
and
alike
to
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
that
the
whole
should
be
buried
in
oblivion
i
charge
you
as
a
friend
by
the
interest
you
have
ever
testified
in
the
fashionable
intelligence
and
by
any
little
advances
with
which
i
may
have
been
able
to
accommodate
you
so
to
bury
it
without
a
word
of
inquiry
this
charge
guppy
delivers
in
a
state
little
short
of
forensic
lunacy

his
friend
shows
a
dazed
mind
in
his
whole
head
of
hair

even
in

cultivated
whiskers
chapter
xl
national
and
domestic
england
has
been
in
a
dreadful
state
for
some
weeks
lord
coodle
would
go
out
sir
thomas
doodle
would
come
in
and
there
being
nobody
in
great
britain
to
speak
of
except
coodle
and
doodle
there
has
been
no
government
it
is
a
mercy
that
the
hostile
meeting
between
those
two
great
men
which
at
one
time
seemed
inevitable
did
not
come
off
because
if
both
pistols
had
taken
effect
and
coodle
and
doodle
had
killed
each
other
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
england
must
have
waited
to
be
governed
until
young
coodle
and
young
doodle
now
in
frocks
and
long
stockings
were
grown
up
this
stupendous
national
calamity
however
was
averted
by
lord
coodle
making
the
timely
discovery
that
if
in
the
heat
of
debate
he
had
said
that
he
scorned
and
despised
the
whole
ignoble
career
of
sir
thomas
doodle
he
had
merely
meant
to
say
that
party
differences
should
never
induce
him
to
withhold
from
it
the
tribute
of
his
warmest
admiration
while
it
as
opportunely
turned
out
on
the
other
hand
that
sir
thomas
doodle
had
in
his
own
bosom
expressly
booked
lord
coodle
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
the
mirror
of
virtue
and
honour
still
england
has
been
some
weeks
in
the
dismal
strait
of
having
no
pilot
as
was
well
observed
by
sir
leicester
dedlock
to
weather
the
storm
and
the
marvellous
part
of
the
matter
is
that
england
has
not
appeared
to
care
very
much
about
it
but
has
gone
on
eating
and
drinking
and
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
as
the
old
world
did
in
the
days
before
the
flood
but
coodle
knew
the
danger
and
doodle
knew
the
danger
and
all
their
followers
and
had
the
clearest
possible
perception
of
the
danger
at
last
sir
thomas
doodle
has
not
only
condescended
to
come
in
but
has
done
it
handsomely
bringing
in
with
him
all
his
nephews
all
his
male
cousins
and
all
his
so
there
is
hope
for
the
old
ship
yet
doodle
has
found
that
he
must
throw
himself
upon
the
country
chiefly
in
the
form
of
sovereigns
and
beer
in
this
metamorphosed
state
he
is
available
in
a
good
many
places
simultaneously
and
can
throw
himself
upon
a
considerable
portion
of
the
country
at
one
time
britannia
being
much
occupied
in
pocketing
doodle
in
the
form
of
sovereigns
and
swallowing
doodle
in
the
form
of
beer
and
in
swearing
herself
black
in
the
face
that
she
does
neither
plainly
to
the
advancement
of
her
glory
and
morality
the
london
season
comes
to
a
sudden
end
through
all
the
doodleites
and
coodleites
dispersing
to
assist
britannia
in
those
religious
exercises
hence

at

wold

though
no
instructions
have
yet
come
down
that
the
family
may
shortly
be
expected
together
with
a
pretty
large
accession
of
cousins
and
others
who
can
in
any
way
assist
the
great
constitutional
work
and
hence
the
stately
old
dame
taking
time
by
the
forelock
leads
him
up
and
down
the
staircases
and
along
the
galleries
and
passages
and
through
the
rooms
to
witness
before
he
grows
any
older
that
everything
is
ready
that
floors
are
rubbed
bright
carpets
spread
curtains
shaken
out
beds
puffed
and
patted
and

cleared
for
action
all
things
prepared
as
beseems
the
dedlock
dignity
this
present
summer
evening
as
the
sun
goes
down
the
preparations
are
complete
dreary
and
solemn
the
old
house
looks
with
so
many
appliances
of
habitation
and
with
no
inhabitants
except
the
pictured
forms
upon
the
walls
so
did
these
come
and
go
a
dedlock
in
possession
might
have
ruminated
passing
along
so
did
they
see
this
gallery
hushed
and
quiet
as
i
see
it
now
so
think
as
i
think
of
the
gap
that
they
would
make
in
this
domain
when
they
were
gone
so
find
it
as
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
it
could
be
without
them
so
pass
from
my
world
as
i
pass
from
theirs
now
closing
the
reverberating
door
so
leave
no
blank
to
miss
them
and
so
die
through
some
of
the
fiery
windows
beautiful
from
without
and
set
at
this
sunset
hour
not
in
stone
but
in
a
glorious
house
of
gold
the
light
excluded
at
other
windows
pours
in
rich
lavish
overflowing
like
the
summer
plenty
in
the
land
then
do
the
frozen
dedlocks
thaw
strange
movements
come
upon
their
features
as
the
shadows
of
leaves
play
there
a
dense
justice
in
a
corner
is
beguiled
into
a
wink
a
staring
baronet
with
a
truncheon
gets
a
dimple
in
his
chin
down
into
the
bosom
of
a
stony
shepherdess
there
steals
a
fleck
of
light
and
warmth
that
would
have
done
it
good
a
hundred
years
ago
one
ancestress
of
volumnia
in
shoes
very
like
her
casting
the
shadow
of
that
virgin
event
before
her
full
two
centuries
shoots
out
into
a
halo
and
becomes
a
saint
a
maid
of
honour
of
the
court
of
charles
the
second
with
large
round
eyes
and
other
charms
to
correspond
seems
to
bathe
in
glowing
water
and
it
ripples
as
it
glows
but
the
fire
of
the
sun
is
dying
even
now
the
floor
is
dusky
and
shadow
slowly
mounts
the
walls
bringing
the
dedlocks
down
like
age
and
death
and
now
upon
my
lady
picture
over
the
great
a
weird
shade
falls
from
some
old
tree
that
turns
it
pale
and
flutters
it
and
looks
as
if
a
great
arm
held
a
veil
or
hood
watching
an
opportunity
to
draw
it
over
her
higher
and
darker
rises
shadow
on
the
wall
now
a
red
gloom
on
the
ceiling
now
the
fire
is
out
all
that
prospect
which
from
the
terrace
looked
so
near
has
moved
solemnly
away
and
changed
not
the
first
nor
the
last
of
beautiful
things
that
look
so
near
and
will
so
change
into
a
distant
phantom
light
mists
arise
and
the
dew
falls
and
all
the
sweet
scents
in
the
garden
are
heavy
in
the
air
now
the
woods
settle
into
great
masses
as
if
they
were
each
one
profound
tree
and
now
the
moon
rises
to
separate
them
and
to
glimmer
here
and
there
in
horizontal
lines
behind
their
stems
and
to
make
the
avenue
a
pavement
of
light
among
high
cathedral
arches
fantastically
broken
now
the
moon
is
high
and
the
great
house
needing
habitation
more
than
ever
is
like
a
body
without
life
now
it
is
even
awful
stealing
through
it
to
think
of
the
live
people
who
have
slept
in
the
solitary
bedrooms
to
say
nothing
of
the
dead
now
is
the
time
for
shadow
when
every
corner
is
a
cavern
and
every
downward
step
a
pit
when
the
stained
glass
is
reflected
in
pale
and
faded
hues
upon
the
floors
when
anything
and
everything
can
be
made
of
the
heavy
staircase
beams
excepting
their
own
proper
shapes
when
the
armour
has
dull
lights
upon
it
not
easily
to
be
distinguished
from
stealthy
movement
and
when
barred
helmets
are
frightfully
suggestive
of
heads
inside
but
of
all
the
shadows
in
chesney
wold
the
shadow
in
the
long
upon
my
lady
picture
is
the
first
to
come
the
last
to
be
disturbed
at
this
hour
and
by
this
light
it
changes
into
threatening
hands
raised
up
and
menacing
the
handsome
face
with
every
breath
that
stirs
she
is
not
well
says
a
groom
in
my
lady
not
well
what
the
matter
why
my
lady
has
been
but
poorly
since
she
was
last
here
i
do
mean
with
the
family
but
when
she
was
here
as
a
bird
of
passage
like
my
lady
has
not
been
out
much
for
her
and
has
kept
her
room
a
good
deal
chesney
wold
thomas
rejoins
the
housekeeper
with
proud
complacency
will
set
my
lady
up
there
is
no
finer
air
and
no
healthier
soil
in
the
world
thomas
may
have
his
own
personal
opinions
on
this
subject
probably
hints
them
in
his
manner
of
smoothing
his
sleek
head
from
the
nape
of
his
neck
to
his
temples
but
he
forbears
to
express
them
further
and
retires
to
the
servants
hall
to
regale
on
cold
and
ale
this
groom
is
the
before
the
nobler
shark
next
evening
down
come
sir
leicester
and
my
lady
with
their
largest
retinue
and
down
come
the
cousins
and
others
from
all
the
points
of
the
compass
thenceforth
for
some
weeks
backward
and
forward
rush
mysterious
men
with
no
names
who
fly
about
all
those
particular
parts
of
the
country
on
which
doodle
is
at
present
throwing
himself
in
an
auriferous
and
malty
shower
but
who
are
merely
persons
of
a
restless
disposition
and
never
do
anything
anywhere
on
these
national
occasions
sir
leicester
finds
the
cousins
useful
a
better
man
than
the
honourable
bob
stables
to
meet
the
hunt
at
dinner
there
could
not
possibly
be
better
got
up
gentlemen
than
the
other
cousins
to
ride
over
to
and
hustings
here
and
there
and
show
themselves
on
the
side
of
england
it
would
be
hard
to
find
volumnia
is
a
little
dim
but
she
is
of
the
true
descent
and
there
are
many
who
appreciate
her
sprightly
conversation
her
french
conundrums
so
old
as
to
have
become
in
the
cycles
of
time
almost
new
again
the
honour
of
taking
the
fair
dedlock
in
to
dinner
or
even
the
privilege
of
her
hand
in
the
dance
on
these
national
occasions
dancing
may
be
a
patriotic
service
and
volumnia
is
constantly
seen
hopping
about
for
the
good
of
an
ungrateful
and
unpensioning
country
my
lady
takes
no
great
pains
to
entertain
the
numerous
guests
and
being
still
unwell
rarely
appears
until
late
in
the
day
but
at
all
the
dismal
dinners
leaden
lunches
basilisk
balls
and
other
melancholy
pageants
her
mere
appearance
is
a
relief
as
to
sir
leicester
he
conceives
it
utterly
impossible
that
anything
can
be
wanting
in
any
direction
by
any
one
who
has
the
good
fortune
to
be
received
under
that
roof
and
in
a
state
of
sublime
satisfaction
he
moves
among
the
company
a
magnificent
refrigerator
daily
the
cousins
trot
through
dust
and
canter
over
roadside
turf
away
to
hustings
and
with
leather
gloves
and
for
the
counties
and
kid
gloves
and
for
the
boroughs
and
daily
bring
back
reports
on
which
sir
leicester
holds
forth
after
dinner
daily
the
restless
men
who
have
no
occupation
in
life
present
the
appearance
of
being
rather
busy
daily
volumnia
has
a
little
cousinly
talk
with
sir
leicester
on
the
state
of
the
nation
from
which
sir
leicester
is
disposed
to
conclude
that
volumnia
is
a
more
reflecting
woman
than
he
had
thought
her
how
are
we
getting
on
says
miss
volumnia
clasping
her
hands
are
we
safe
the
mighty
business
is
nearly
over
by
this
time
and
doodle
will
throw
himself
off
the
country
in
a
few
days
more
sir
leicester
has
just
appeared
in
the
long
after
dinner
a
bright
particular
star
surrounded
by
clouds
of
cousins
volumnia
replies
sir
leicester
who
has
a
list
in
his
hand
we
are
doing
tolerably
only
tolerably
although
it
is
summer
weather
sir
leicester
always
has
his
own
particular
fire
in
the
evening
he
takes
his
usual
screened
seat
near
it
and
repeats
with
much
firmness
and
a
little
displeasure
as
who
should
say
i
am
not
a
common
man
and
when
i
say
tolerably
it
must
not
be
understood
as
a
common
expression
volumnia
we
are
doing
tolerably
at
least
there
is
no
opposition
to
you
volumnia
asserts
with
confidence
no
volumnia
this
distracted
country
has
lost
its
senses
in
many
respects
i
grieve
to
say
but
it
is
not
so
mad
as
that
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
volumnia
finishing
the
sentence
restores
her
to
favour
sir
leicester
with
a
gracious
inclination
of
his
head
seems
to
say
to
himself
a
sensible
woman
this
on
the
whole
though
occasionally
precipitate
in
fact
as
to
this
question
of
opposition
the
fair
observation
was
superfluous
sir
leicester
on
these
occasions
always
delivering
in
his
own
candidateship
as
a
kind
of
handsome
wholesale
order
to
be
promptly
executed
two
other
little
seats
that
belong
to
him
he
treats
as
retail
orders
of
less
importance
merely
sending
down
the
men
and
signifying
to
the
tradespeople
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
make
these
materials
into
two
members
of
parliament
and
to
send
them
home
when
done
i
regret
to
say
volumnia
that
in
many
places
the
people
have
shown
a
bad
spirit
and
that
this
opposition
to
the
government
has
been
of
a
most
determined
and
most
implacable
description
says
volumnia
even
proceeds
sir
leicester
glancing
at
the
circumjacent
cousins
on
sofas
and
ottomans
even
in
many
in
fact
in
most
of
those
places
in
which
the
government
has
carried
it
against
a
faction
note
by
the
way
that
the
coodleites
are
always
a
faction
with
the
doodleites
and
that
the
doodleites
occupy
exactly
the
same
position
towards
the
coodleites
even
in
them
i
am
shocked
for
the
credit
of
englishmen
to
be
constrained
to
inform
you
that
the
party
has
not
triumphed
without
being
put
to
an
enormous
expense
hundreds
says
sir
leicester
eyeing
the
cousins
with
increasing
dignity
and
swelling
indignation
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
if
volumnia
have
a
fault
it
is
the
fault
of
being
a
trifle
too
innocent
seeing
that
the
innocence
which
would
go
extremely
well
with
a
sash
and
tucker
is
a
little
out
of
keeping
with
the
rouge
and
pearl
necklace
howbeit
impelled
by
innocence
she
asks
what
for
volumnia
remonstrates
sir
leicester
with
his
utmost
severity
volumnia
no
no
i
do
mean
what
for
cries
volumnia
with
her
favourite
little
scream
how
stupid
i
am
i
mean
what
a
pity
i
am
glad
returns
sir
leicester
that
you
do
mean
what
a
pity
volumnia
hastens
to
express
her
opinion
that
the
shocking
people
ought
to
be
tried
as
traitors
and
made
to
support
the
party
i
am
glad
volumnia
repeats
sir
leicester
unmindful
of
these
mollifying
sentiments
that
you
do
mean
what
a
pity
it
is
disgraceful
to
the
electors
but
as
you
though
inadvertently
and
without
intending
so
unreasonable
a
question
asked
me
for
let
me
reply
to
you
for
necessary
expenses
and
i
trust
to
your
good
sense
volumnia
not
to
pursue
the
subject
here
or
elsewhere
sir
leicester
feels
it
incumbent
on
him
to
observe
a
crushing
aspect
towards
volumnia
because
it
is
whispered
abroad
that
these
necessary
expenses
will
in
some
two
hundred
election
petitions
be
unpleasantly
connected
with
the
word
bribery
and
because
some
graceless
jokers
have
consequently
suggested
the
omission
from
the
church
service
of
the
ordinary
supplication
in
behalf
of
the
high
court
of
parliament
and
have
recommended
instead
that
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
be
requested
for
six
hundred
and
gentlemen
in
a
very
unhealthy
state
i
suppose
observes
volumnia
having
taken
a
little
time
to
recover
her
spirits
after
her
late
castigation
i
suppose
tulkinghorn
has
been
worked
to
death
i
do
know
says
sir
leicester
opening
his
eyes
why
tulkinghorn
should
be
worked
to
death
i
do
know
what
tulkinghorn
engagements
may
be
he
is
not
a
candidate
volumnia
had
thought
he
might
have
been
employed
sir
leicester
could
desire
to
know
by
whom
and
what
for
volumnia
abashed
again
suggests
by
somebody
to
advise
and
make
arrangements
sir
leicester
is
not
aware
that
any
client
of
tulkinghorn
has
been
in
need
of
his
assistance
lady
dedlock
seated
at
an
open
window
with
her
arm
upon
its
cushioned
ledge
and
looking
out
at
the
evening
shadows
falling
on
the
park
has
seemed
to
attend
since
the
lawyer
name
was
mentioned
a
languid
cousin
with
a
moustache
in
a
state
of
extreme
debility
now
observes
from
his
couch
that
man
told
him
that
tulkinghorn
had
gone
down
t
that
iron
place
t
give
legal
something
and
that
contest
being
over
t
day
be
highly
jawlly
thing
if
tulkinghorn
should
with
news
that
coodle
man
was
floored
mercury
in
attendance
with
coffee
informs
sir
leicester
hereupon
that
tulkinghorn
has
arrived
and
is
taking
dinner
my
lady
turns
her
head
inward
for
the
moment
then
looks
out
again
as
before
volumnia
is
charmed
to
hear
that
her
delight
is
come
he
is
so
original
such
a
stolid
creature
such
an
immense
being
for
knowing
all
sorts
of
things
and
never
telling
them
volumnia
is
persuaded
that
he
must
be
a
freemason
is
sure
he
is
at
the
head
of
a
lodge
and
wears
short
aprons
and
is
made
a
perfect
idol
of
with
candlesticks
and
trowels
these
lively
remarks
the
fair
dedlock
delivers
in
her
youthful
manner
while
making
a
purse
he
has
not
been
here
once
she
adds
since
i
came
i
really
had
some
thoughts
of
breaking
my
heart
for
the
inconstant
creature
i
had
almost
made
up
my
mind
that
he
was
dead
it
may
be
the
gathering
gloom
of
evening
or
it
may
be
the
darker
gloom
within
herself
but
a
shade
is
on
my
lady
face
as
if
she
thought
i
would
he
were
tulkinghorn
says
sir
leicester
is
always
welcome
here
and
always
discreet
wheresoever
he
is
a
very
valuable
person
and
deservedly
respected
the
debilitated
cousin
supposes
he
is
rich
fler
he
has
a
stake
in
the
country
says
sir
leicester
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
of
course
handsomely
paid
and
he
associates
almost
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
the
highest
society
everybody
starts
for
a
gun
is
fired
close
by
good
gracious
what
that
cries
volumnia
with
her
little
withered
scream
a
rat
says
my
lady
and
they
have
shot
him
enter
tulkinghorn
followed
by
mercuries
with
lamps
and
candles
no
no
says
sir
leicester
i
think
not
my
lady
do
you
object
to
the
twilight
on
the
contrary
my
lady
prefers
it
volumnia
oh
nothing
is
so
delicious
to
volumnia
as
to
sit
and
talk
in
the
dark
then
take
them
away
says
sir
leicester
tulkinghorn
i
beg
your
pardon
how
do
you
do
tulkinghorn
with
his
usual
leisurely
ease
advances
renders
his
passing
homage
to
my
lady
shakes
sir
leicester
hand
and
subsides
into
the
chair
proper
to
him
when
he
has
anything
to
communicate
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
baronet
little
sir
leicester
is
apprehensive
that
my
lady
not
being
very
well
will
take
cold
at
that
open
window
my
lady
is
obliged
to
him
but
would
rather
sit
there
for
the
air
sir
leicester
rises
adjusts
her
scarf
about
her
and
returns
to
his
seat
tulkinghorn
in
the
meanwhile
takes
a
pinch
of
snuff
now
says
sir
leicester
how
has
that
contest
gone
oh
hollow
from
the
beginning
not
a
chance
they
have
brought
in
both
their
people
you
are
beaten
out
of
all
reason
three
to
one
it
is
a
part
of
tulkinghorn
policy
and
mastery
to
have
no
political
opinions
indeed
no
opinions
therefore
he
says
you
are
beaten
and
not
we
sir
leicester
is
majestically
wroth
volumnia
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
debilitated
cousin
holds
that
it
sort
of
thing
sure
tapn
slongs
votes
mob
it
the
place
you
know
tulkinghorn
goes
on
to
say
in
the
darkness
when
there
is
silence
again
where
they
wanted
to
put
up
rouncewell
son
a
proposal
which
as
you
correctly
informed
me
at
the
time
he
had
the
becoming
taste
and
perception
observes
sir
leicester
to
decline
i
can
not
say
that
i
by
any
means
approve
of
the
sentiments
expressed
by
rouncewell
when
he
was
here
for
some
in
this
room
but
there
was
a
sense
of
propriety
in
his
decision
which
i
am
glad
to
acknowledge
ha
says
tulkinghorn
it
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
very
active
in
this
election
though
sir
leicester
is
distinctly
heard
to
gasp
before
speaking
did
i
understand
you
did
you
say
that
rouncewell
had
been
very
active
in
this
election
uncommonly
active
against
oh
dear
yes
against
you
he
is
a
very
good
speaker
plain
and
emphatic
he
made
a
damaging
effect
and
has
great
influence
in
the
business
part
of
the
proceedings
he
carried
all
before
him
it
is
evident
to
the
whole
company
though
nobody
can
see
him
that
sir
leicester
is
staring
majestically
and
he
was
much
assisted
says
tulkinghorn
as
a
by
his
son
by
his
son
sir
repeats
sir
leicester
with
awful
politeness
by
his
son
the
son
who
wished
to
marry
the
young
woman
in
my
lady
service
that
son
he
has
but
one
then
upon
my
honour
says
sir
leicester
after
a
terrific
pause
during
which
he
has
been
heard
to
snort
and
felt
to
stare
then
upon
my
honour
upon
my
life
upon
my
reputation
and
principles
the
floodgates
of
society
are
burst
open
and
the
waters
have
a
obliterated
the
landmarks
of
the
framework
of
the
cohesion
by
which
things
are
held
together
general
burst
of
cousinly
indignation
volumnia
thinks
it
is
really
high
time
you
know
for
somebody
in
power
to
step
in
and
do
something
strong
debilitated
cousin
thinks
going
dayvle
pace
i
beg
says
sir
leicester
in
a
breathless
condition
that
we
may
not
comment
further
on
this
circumstance
comment
is
superfluous
my
lady
let
me
suggest
in
reference
to
that
young
woman
i
have
no
intention
observes
my
lady
from
her
window
in
a
low
but
decided
tone
of
parting
with
her
that
was
not
my
meaning
returns
sir
leicester
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
i
would
suggest
that
as
you
think
her
worthy
of
your
patronage
you
should
exert
your
influence
to
keep
her
from
these
dangerous
hands
you
might
show
her
what
violence
would
be
done
in
such
association
to
her
duties
and
principles
and
you
might
preserve
her
for
a
better
fate
you
might
point
out
to
her
that
she
probably
would
in
good
time
find
a
husband
at
chesney
wold
by
whom
she
would
not
be
sir
leicester
adds
after
a
moment
consideration
dragged
from
the
altars
of
her
forefathers
these
remarks
he
offers
with
his
unvarying
politeness
and
deference
when
he
addresses
himself
to
his
wife
she
merely
moves
her
head
in
reply
the
moon
is
rising
and
where
she
sits
there
is
a
little
stream
of
cold
pale
light
in
which
her
head
is
seen
it
is
worthy
of
remark
says
tulkinghorn
however
that
these
people
are
in
their
way
very
proud
proud
sir
leicester
doubts
his
hearing
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
they
all
voluntarily
abandoned
the
girl
yes
lover
and
all
instead
of
her
abandoning
them
supposing
she
remained
at
chesney
wold
under
such
circumstances
well
says
sir
leicester
tremulously
well
you
should
know
tulkinghorn
you
have
been
among
them
really
sir
leicester
returns
the
lawyer
i
state
the
fact
why
i
could
tell
you
a
story
with
lady
dedlock
permission
her
head
concedes
it
and
volumnia
is
enchanted
a
story
oh
he
is
going
to
tell
something
at
last
a
ghost
in
it
volumnia
hopes
no
real
flesh
and
blood
tulkinghorn
stops
for
an
instant
and
repeats
with
some
little
emphasis
grafted
upon
his
usual
monotony
real
flesh
and
blood
miss
dedlock
sir
leicester
these
particulars
have
only
lately
become
known
to
me
they
are
very
brief
they
exemplify
what
i
have
said
i
suppress
names
for
the
present
lady
dedlock
will
not
think
me
i
hope
by
the
light
of
the
fire
which
is
low
he
can
be
seen
looking
towards
the
moonlight
by
the
light
of
the
moon
lady
dedlock
can
be
seen
perfectly
still
a
townsman
of
this
rouncewell
a
man
in
exactly
parallel
circumstances
as
i
am
told
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
a
daughter
who
attracted
the
notice
of
a
great
lady
i
speak
of
really
a
great
lady
not
merely
great
to
him
but
married
to
a
gentleman
of
your
condition
sir
leicester
sir
leicester
condescendingly
says
yes
tulkinghorn
implying
that
then
she
must
have
appeared
of
very
considerable
moral
dimensions
indeed
in
the
eyes
of
an
the
lady
was
wealthy
and
beautiful
and
had
a
liking
for
the
girl
and
treated
her
with
great
kindness
and
kept
her
always
near
her
now
this
lady
preserved
a
secret
under
all
her
greatness
which
she
had
preserved
for
many
years
in
fact
she
had
in
early
life
been
engaged
to
marry
a
young
rake
he
was
a
captain
in
the
army
nothing
connected
with
whom
came
to
any
good
she
never
did
marry
him
but
she
gave
birth
to
a
child
of
which
he
was
the
father
by
the
light
of
the
fire
he
can
be
seen
looking
towards
the
moonlight
by
the
moonlight
lady
dedlock
can
be
seen
in
profile
perfectly
still
the
captain
in
the
army
being
dead
she
believed
herself
safe
but
a
train
of
circumstances
with
which
i
need
not
trouble
you
led
to
discovery
as
i
received
the
story
they
began
in
an
imprudence
on
her
own
part
one
day
when
she
was
taken
by
surprise
which
shows
how
difficult
it
is
for
the
firmest
of
us
she
was
very
firm
to
be
always
guarded
there
was
great
domestic
trouble
and
amazement
you
may
suppose
i
leave
you
to
imagine
sir
leicester
the
grief
but
that
is
not
the
present
point
when
townsman
heard
of
the
disclosure
he
no
more
allowed
the
girl
to
be
patronized
and
honoured
than
he
would
have
suffered
her
to
be
trodden
underfoot
before
his
eyes
such
was
his
pride
that
he
indignantly
took
her
away
as
if
from
reproach
and
disgrace
he
had
no
sense
of
the
honour
done
him
and
his
daughter
by
the
lady
condescension
not
the
least
he
resented
the
girl
position
as
if
the
lady
had
been
the
commonest
of
commoners
that
is
the
story
i
hope
lady
dedlock
will
excuse
its
painful
nature
there
are
various
opinions
on
the
merits
more
or
less
conflicting
with
volumnia
that
fair
young
creature
can
not
believe
there
ever
was
any
such
lady
and
rejects
the
whole
history
on
the
threshold
the
majority
incline
to
the
debilitated
cousin
sentiment
which
is
in
few
words
no
business
rouncewell
fernal
townsman
sir
leicester
generally
refers
back
in
his
mind
to
wat
tyler
and
arranges
a
sequence
of
events
on
a
plan
of
his
own
there
is
not
much
conversation
in
all
for
late
hours
have
been
kept
at
chesney
wold
since
the
necessary
expenses
elsewhere
began
and
this
is
the
first
night
in
many
on
which
the
family
have
been
alone
it
is
past
ten
when
sir
leicester
begs
tulkinghorn
to
ring
for
candles
then
the
stream
of
moonlight
has
swelled
into
a
lake
and
then
lady
dedlock
for
the
first
time
moves
and
rises
and
comes
forward
to
a
table
for
a
glass
of
water
winking
cousins
in
the
candle
glare
crowd
round
to
give
it
volumnia
always
ready
for
something
better
if
procurable
takes
another
a
very
mild
sip
of
which
contents
her
lady
dedlock
graceful
looked
after
by
admiring
eyes
passes
away
slowly
down
the
long
perspective
by
the
side
of
that
nymph
not
at
all
improving
her
as
a
question
of
contrast
chapter
xli
in
tulkinghorn
room
tulkinghorn
arrives
in
his
a
little
breathed
by
the
journey
up
though
leisurely
performed
there
is
an
expression
on
his
face
as
if
he
had
discharged
his
mind
of
some
grave
matter
and
were
in
his
close
way
satisfied
to
say
of
a
man
so
severely
and
strictly
that
he
is
triumphant
would
be
to
do
him
as
great
an
injustice
as
to
suppose
him
troubled
with
love
or
sentiment
or
any
romantic
weakness
he
is
sedately
satisfied
perhaps
there
is
a
rather
increased
sense
of
power
upon
him
as
he
loosely
grasps
one
of
his
veinous
wrists
with
his
other
hand
and
holding
it
behind
his
back
walks
noiselessly
up
and
down
there
is
a
capacious
in
the
room
on
which
is
a
pretty
large
accumulation
of
papers
the
green
lamp
is
lighted
his
lie
upon
the
desk
the
is
wheeled
up
to
it
and
it
would
seem
as
though
he
had
intended
to
bestow
an
hour
or
so
upon
these
claims
on
his
attention
before
going
to
bed
but
he
happens
not
to
be
in
a
business
mind
after
a
glance
at
the
documents
awaiting
his
notice
with
his
head
bent
low
over
the
table
the
old
man
sight
for
print
or
writing
being
defective
at
night
he
opens
the
french
window
and
steps
out
upon
the
leads
there
he
again
walks
slowly
up
and
down
in
the
same
attitude
subsiding
if
a
man
so
cool
may
have
any
need
to
subside
from
the
story
he
has
related
downstairs
the
time
was
once
when
men
as
knowing
as
tulkinghorn
would
walk
on
in
the
starlight
and
look
up
into
the
sky
to
read
their
fortunes
there
hosts
of
stars
are
visible
though
their
brilliancy
is
eclipsed
by
the
splendour
of
the
moon
if
he
be
seeking
his
own
star
as
he
methodically
turns
and
turns
upon
the
leads
it
should
be
but
a
pale
one
to
be
so
rustily
represented
below
if
he
be
tracing
out
his
destiny
that
may
be
written
in
other
characters
nearer
to
his
hand
as
he
paces
the
leads
with
his
eyes
most
probably
as
high
above
his
thoughts
as
they
are
high
above
the
earth
he
is
suddenly
stopped
in
passing
the
window
by
two
eyes
that
meet
his
own
the
ceiling
of
his
room
is
rather
low
and
the
upper
part
of
the
door
which
is
opposite
the
window
is
of
glass
there
is
an
inner
baize
door
too
but
the
night
being
warm
he
did
not
close
it
when
he
came
upstairs
these
eyes
that
meet
his
own
are
looking
in
through
the
glass
from
the
corridor
outside
he
knows
them
well
the
blood
has
not
flushed
into
his
face
so
suddenly
and
redly
for
many
a
long
year
as
when
he
recognizes
lady
dedlock
he
steps
into
the
room
and
she
comes
in
too
closing
both
the
doors
behind
her
there
is
a
wild
disturbance
is
it
fear
or
anger
in
her
eyes
in
her
carriage
and
all
else
she
looks
as
she
looked
downstairs
two
hours
ago
is
it
fear
or
is
it
anger
now
he
can
not
be
sure
both
might
be
as
pale
both
as
intent
lady
dedlock
she
does
not
speak
at
first
nor
even
when
she
has
slowly
dropped
into
the
by
the
table
they
look
at
each
other
like
two
pictures
why
have
you
told
my
story
to
so
many
persons
lady
dedlock
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
inform
you
that
i
knew
it
how
long
have
you
known
it
i
have
suspected
it
a
long
while
fully
known
it
a
little
while
months
days
he
stands
before
her
with
one
hand
on
a
and
the
other
in
his
waistcoat
and
exactly
as
he
has
stood
before
her
at
any
time
since
her
marriage
the
same
formal
politeness
the
same
composed
deference
that
might
as
well
be
defiance
the
whole
man
the
same
dark
cold
object
at
the
same
distance
which
nothing
has
ever
diminished
is
this
true
concerning
the
poor
girl
he
slightly
inclines
and
advances
his
head
as
not
quite
understanding
the
question
you
know
what
you
related
is
it
true
do
her
friends
know
my
story
also
is
it
the
yet
is
it
chalked
upon
the
walls
and
cried
in
the
streets
so
anger
and
fear
and
shame
all
three
contending
what
power
this
woman
has
to
keep
these
raging
passions
down
thoughts
take
such
form
as
he
looks
at
her
with
his
ragged
grey
eyebrows
a
hair
breadth
more
contracted
than
usual
under
her
gaze
no
lady
dedlock
that
was
a
hypothetical
case
arising
out
of
sir
leicester
unconsciously
carrying
the
matter
with
so
high
a
hand
but
it
would
be
a
real
case
if
they
knew
what
we
know
then
they
do
not
know
it
yet
no
can
i
save
the
poor
girl
from
injury
before
they
know
it
really
lady
dedlock
tulkinghorn
replies
i
can
not
give
a
satisfactory
opinion
on
that
point
and
he
thinks
with
the
interest
of
attentive
curiosity
as
he
watches
the
struggle
in
her
breast
the
power
and
force
of
this
woman
are
astonishing
sir
she
says
for
the
moment
obliged
to
set
her
lips
with
all
the
energy
she
has
that
she
may
speak
distinctly
i
will
make
it
plainer
i
do
not
dispute
your
hypothetical
case
i
anticipated
it
and
felt
its
truth
as
strongly
as
you
can
do
when
i
saw
rouncewell
here
i
knew
very
well
that
if
he
could
have
had
the
power
of
seeing
me
as
i
was
he
would
consider
the
poor
girl
tarnished
by
having
for
a
moment
been
although
most
innocently
the
subject
of
my
great
and
distinguished
patronage
but
i
have
an
interest
in
her
or
i
should
rather
say
no
longer
belonging
to
this
place
i
had
and
if
you
can
find
so
much
consideration
for
the
woman
under
your
foot
as
to
remember
that
she
will
be
very
sensible
of
your
mercy
tulkinghorn
profoundly
attentive
throws
this
off
with
a
shrug
of
and
contracts
his
eyebrows
a
little
more
you
have
prepared
me
for
my
exposure
and
i
thank
you
for
that
too
is
there
anything
that
you
require
of
me
is
there
any
claim
that
i
can
release
or
any
charge
or
trouble
that
i
can
spare
my
husband
in
obtaining
his
release
by
certifying
to
the
exactness
of
your
discovery
i
will
write
anything
here
and
now
that
you
will
dictate
i
am
ready
to
do
it
and
she
would
do
it
thinks
the
lawyer
watchful
of
the
firm
hand
with
which
she
takes
the
pen
i
will
not
trouble
you
lady
dedlock
pray
spare
yourself
i
have
long
expected
this
as
you
know
i
neither
wish
to
spare
myself
nor
to
be
spared
you
can
do
nothing
worse
to
me
than
you
have
done
do
what
remains
now
lady
dedlock
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
i
will
take
leave
to
say
a
few
words
when
you
have
finished
their
need
for
watching
one
another
should
be
over
now
but
they
do
it
all
this
time
and
the
stars
watch
them
both
through
the
opened
window
away
in
the
moonlight
lie
the
woodland
fields
at
rest
and
the
wide
house
is
as
quiet
as
the
narrow
one
the
narrow
one
where
are
the
digger
and
the
spade
this
peaceful
night
destined
to
add
the
last
great
secret
to
the
many
secrets
of
the
tulkinghorn
existence
is
the
man
born
yet
is
the
spade
wrought
yet
curious
questions
to
consider
more
curious
perhaps
not
to
consider
under
the
watching
stars
upon
a
summer
night
of
repentance
or
remorse
or
any
feeling
of
mine
lady
dedlock
presently
proceeds
i
say
not
a
word
if
i
were
not
dumb
you
would
be
deaf
let
that
go
by
it
is
not
for
your
ears
he
makes
a
feint
of
offering
a
protest
but
she
sweeps
it
away
with
her
disdainful
hand
of
other
and
very
different
things
i
come
to
speak
to
you
my
jewels
are
all
in
their
proper
places
of
keeping
they
will
be
found
there
so
my
dresses
so
all
the
valuables
i
have
some
ready
money
i
had
with
me
please
to
say
but
no
large
amount
i
did
not
wear
my
own
dress
in
order
that
i
might
avoid
observation
i
went
to
be
henceforward
lost
make
this
known
i
leave
no
other
charge
with
you
excuse
me
lady
dedlock
says
tulkinghorn
quite
unmoved
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
you
want
to
be
lost
to
all
here
i
leave
chesney
wold
i
go
this
hour
tulkinghorn
shakes
his
head
she
rises
but
he
without
moving
hand
from
or
from
waistcoat
and
shakes
his
head
what
not
go
as
i
have
said
no
lady
dedlock
he
very
calmly
replies
do
you
know
the
relief
that
my
disappearance
will
be
have
you
forgotten
the
stain
and
blot
upon
this
place
and
where
it
is
and
who
it
is
no
lady
dedlock
not
by
any
means
without
deigning
to
rejoin
she
moves
to
the
inner
door
and
has
it
in
her
hand
when
he
says
to
her
without
himself
stirring
hand
or
foot
or
raising
his
voice
lady
dedlock
have
the
goodness
to
stop
and
hear
me
or
before
you
reach
the
staircase
i
shall
ring
the
and
rouse
the
house
and
then
i
must
speak
out
before
every
guest
and
servant
every
man
and
woman
in
it
he
has
conquered
her
she
falters
trembles
and
puts
her
hand
confusedly
to
her
head
slight
tokens
these
in
any
one
else
but
when
so
practised
an
eye
as
tulkinghorn
sees
indecision
for
a
moment
in
such
a
subject
he
thoroughly
knows
its
value
he
promptly
says
again
have
the
goodness
to
hear
me
lady
dedlock
and
motions
to
the
chair
from
which
she
has
risen
she
hesitates
but
he
motions
again
and
she
sits
down
the
relations
between
us
are
of
an
unfortunate
description
lady
dedlock
but
as
they
are
not
of
my
making
i
will
not
apologize
for
them
the
position
i
hold
in
reference
to
sir
leicester
is
so
well
known
to
you
that
i
can
hardly
imagine
but
that
i
must
long
have
appeared
in
your
eyes
the
natural
person
to
make
this
discovery
sir
she
returns
without
looking
up
from
the
ground
on
which
her
eyes
are
now
fixed
i
had
better
have
gone
it
would
have
been
far
better
not
to
have
detained
me
i
have
no
more
to
say
excuse
me
lady
dedlock
if
i
add
a
little
more
to
hear
i
wish
to
hear
it
at
the
window
then
i
ca
breathe
where
i
am
his
jealous
glance
as
she
walks
that
way
betrays
an
misgiving
that
she
may
have
it
in
her
thoughts
to
leap
over
and
dashing
against
ledge
and
cornice
strike
her
life
out
upon
the
terrace
below
but
a
moment
observation
of
her
figure
as
she
stands
in
the
window
without
any
support
looking
out
at
the
stars
not
up
gloomily
out
at
those
stars
which
are
low
in
the
heavens
reassures
him
by
facing
round
as
she
has
moved
he
stands
a
little
behind
her
lady
dedlock
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
come
to
a
decision
satisfactory
to
myself
on
the
course
before
me
i
am
not
clear
what
to
do
or
how
to
act
next
i
must
request
you
in
the
meantime
to
keep
your
secret
as
you
have
kept
it
so
long
and
not
to
wonder
that
i
keep
it
too
he
pauses
but
she
makes
no
reply
pardon
me
lady
dedlock
this
is
an
important
subject
you
are
honouring
me
with
your
attention
i
am
thank
you
i
might
have
known
it
from
what
i
have
seen
of
your
strength
of
character
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
the
question
but
i
have
the
habit
of
making
sure
of
my
ground
step
by
step
as
i
go
on
the
sole
consideration
in
this
unhappy
case
is
sir
leicester
then
why
she
asks
in
a
low
voice
and
without
removing
her
gloomy
look
from
those
distant
stars
do
you
detain
me
in
his
house
because
he
is
the
consideration
lady
dedlock
i
have
no
occasion
to
tell
you
that
sir
leicester
is
a
very
proud
man
that
his
reliance
upon
you
is
implicit
that
the
fall
of
that
moon
out
of
the
sky
would
not
amaze
him
more
than
your
fall
from
your
high
position
as
his
wife
she
breathes
quickly
and
heavily
but
she
stands
as
unflinchingly
as
ever
he
has
seen
her
in
the
midst
of
her
grandest
company
i
declare
to
you
lady
dedlock
that
with
anything
short
of
this
case
that
i
have
i
would
as
soon
have
hoped
to
root
up
by
means
of
my
own
strength
and
my
own
hands
the
oldest
tree
on
this
estate
as
to
shake
your
hold
upon
sir
leicester
and
sir
leicester
trust
and
confidence
in
you
and
even
now
with
this
case
i
hesitate
not
that
he
could
doubt
that
even
with
him
is
impossible
but
that
nothing
can
prepare
him
for
the
blow
not
my
flight
she
returned
think
of
it
again
your
flight
lady
dedlock
would
spread
the
whole
truth
and
a
hundred
times
the
whole
truth
far
and
wide
it
would
be
impossible
to
save
the
family
credit
for
a
day
it
is
not
to
be
thought
of
there
is
a
quiet
decision
in
his
reply
which
admits
of
no
remonstrance
when
i
speak
of
sir
leicester
being
the
sole
consideration
he
and
the
family
credit
are
one
sir
leicester
and
the
baronetcy
sir
leicester
and
chesney
wold
sir
leicester
and
his
ancestors
and
his
patrimony
tulkinghorn
very
dry
here
are
i
need
not
say
to
you
lady
dedlock
inseparable
go
on
therefore
says
tulkinghorn
pursuing
his
case
in
his
style
i
have
much
to
consider
this
is
to
be
hushed
up
if
it
can
be
how
can
it
be
if
sir
leicester
is
driven
out
of
his
wits
or
laid
upon
a
if
i
inflicted
this
shock
upon
him
morning
how
could
the
immediate
change
in
him
be
accounted
for
what
could
have
caused
it
what
could
have
divided
you
lady
dedlock
the
and
the
would
come
on
directly
and
you
are
to
remember
that
it
would
not
affect
you
merely
whom
i
can
not
at
all
consider
in
this
business
but
your
husband
lady
dedlock
your
husband
he
gets
plainer
as
he
gets
on
but
not
an
atom
more
emphatic
or
animated
there
is
another
point
of
view
he
continues
in
which
the
case
presents
itself
sir
leicester
is
devoted
to
you
almost
to
infatuation
he
might
not
be
able
to
overcome
that
infatuation
even
knowing
what
we
know
i
am
putting
an
extreme
case
but
it
might
be
so
if
so
it
were
better
that
he
knew
nothing
better
for
common
sense
better
for
him
better
for
me
i
must
take
all
this
into
account
and
it
combines
to
render
a
decision
very
difficult
she
stands
looking
out
at
the
same
stars
without
a
word
they
are
beginning
to
pale
and
she
looks
as
if
their
coldness
froze
her
my
experience
teaches
me
says
tulkinghorn
who
has
by
this
time
got
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
is
going
on
in
his
business
consideration
of
the
matter
like
a
machine
my
experience
teaches
me
lady
dedlock
that
most
of
the
people
i
know
would
do
far
better
to
leave
marriage
alone
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
three
fourths
of
their
troubles
so
i
thought
when
sir
leicester
married
and
so
i
always
have
thought
since
no
more
about
that
i
must
now
be
guided
by
circumstances
in
the
meanwhile
i
must
beg
you
to
keep
your
own
counsel
and
i
will
keep
mine
i
am
to
drag
my
present
life
on
holding
its
pains
at
your
pleasure
day
by
day
she
asks
still
looking
at
the
distant
sky
yes
i
am
afraid
so
lady
dedlock
it
is
necessary
you
think
that
i
should
be
so
tied
to
the
stake
i
am
sure
that
what
i
recommend
is
necessary
i
am
to
remain
on
this
gaudy
platform
on
which
my
miserable
deception
has
been
so
long
acted
and
it
is
to
fall
beneath
me
when
you
give
the
signal
she
said
slowly
not
without
notice
lady
dedlock
i
shall
take
no
step
without
forewarning
you
she
asks
all
her
questions
as
if
she
were
repeating
them
from
memory
or
calling
them
over
in
her
sleep
we
are
to
meet
as
usual
precisely
as
usual
if
you
please
and
i
am
to
hide
my
guilt
as
i
have
done
so
many
years
as
you
have
done
so
many
years
i
should
not
have
made
that
reference
myself
lady
dedlock
but
i
may
now
remind
you
that
your
secret
can
be
no
heavier
to
you
than
it
was
and
is
no
worse
and
no
better
than
it
was
i
know
it
certainly
but
i
believe
we
have
never
wholly
trusted
each
other
she
stands
absorbed
in
the
same
frozen
way
for
some
little
time
before
asking
is
there
anything
more
to
be
said
why
tulkinghorn
returns
methodically
as
he
softly
rubs
his
hands
i
should
like
to
be
assured
of
your
acquiescence
in
my
arrangements
lady
dedlock
you
may
be
assured
of
it
good
and
i
would
wish
in
conclusion
to
remind
you
as
a
business
precaution
in
case
it
should
be
necessary
to
recall
the
fact
in
any
communication
with
sir
leicester
that
throughout
our
interview
i
have
expressly
stated
my
sole
consideration
to
be
sir
feelings
and
honour
and
the
family
reputation
i
should
have
been
happy
to
have
made
lady
dedlock
a
prominent
consideration
too
if
the
case
had
admitted
of
it
but
unfortunately
it
does
not
i
can
attest
your
fidelity
sir
both
before
and
after
saying
it
she
remains
absorbed
but
at
length
moves
and
turns
unshaken
in
her
natural
and
acquired
presence
towards
the
door
tulkinghorn
opens
both
the
doors
exactly
as
he
would
have
done
yesterday
or
as
he
would
have
done
ten
years
ago
and
makes
his
bow
as
she
passes
out
it
is
not
an
ordinary
look
that
he
receives
from
the
handsome
face
as
it
goes
into
the
darkness
and
it
is
not
an
ordinary
movement
though
a
very
slight
one
that
acknowledges
his
courtesy
but
as
he
reflects
when
he
is
left
alone
the
woman
has
been
putting
no
common
constraint
upon
herself
he
would
know
it
all
the
better
if
he
saw
the
woman
pacing
her
own
rooms
with
her
hair
wildly
thrown
from
her
face
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
her
figure
twisted
as
if
by
pain
he
would
think
so
all
the
more
if
he
saw
the
woman
thus
hurrying
up
and
down
for
hours
without
fatigue
without
intermission
followed
by
the
faithful
step
upon
the
ghost
walk
but
he
shuts
out
the
now
chilled
air
draws
the
goes
to
bed
and
falls
asleep
and
truly
when
the
stars
go
out
and
the
wan
day
peeps
into
the
finding
him
at
his
oldest
he
looks
as
if
the
digger
and
the
spade
were
both
commissioned
and
would
soon
be
digging
the
same
wan
day
peeps
in
at
sir
leicester
pardoning
the
repentant
country
in
a
majestically
condescending
dream
and
at
the
cousins
entering
on
various
public
employments
principally
receipt
of
salary
and
at
the
chaste
volumnia
bestowing
a
dower
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
upon
a
hideous
old
general
with
a
mouth
of
false
teeth
like
a
pianoforte
too
full
of
keys
long
the
admiration
of
bath
and
the
terror
of
every
other
community
also
into
rooms
high
in
the
roof
and
into
offices
in
and
over
stables
where
humbler
ambition
dreams
of
bliss
in
keepers
lodges
and
in
holy
matrimony
with
will
or
sally
up
comes
the
bright
sun
drawing
everything
up
with
it
the
wills
and
sallys
the
latent
vapour
in
the
earth
the
drooping
leaves
and
flowers
the
birds
and
beasts
and
creeping
things
the
gardeners
to
sweep
the
dewy
turf
and
unfold
emerald
velvet
where
the
roller
passes
the
smoke
of
the
great
kitchen
fire
wreathing
itself
straight
and
high
into
the
lightsome
air
lastly
up
comes
the
flag
over
tulkinghorn
unconscious
head
cheerfully
proclaiming
that
sir
leicester
and
lady
dedlock
are
in
their
happy
home
and
that
there
is
hospitality
at
the
place
in
lincolnshire
chapter
xlii
in
tulkinghorn
chambers
from
the
verdant
undulations
and
the
spreading
oaks
of
the
dedlock
property
tulkinghorn
transfers
himself
to
the
stale
heat
and
dust
of
london
his
manner
of
coming
and
going
between
the
two
places
is
one
of
his
impenetrabilities
he
walks
into
chesney
wold
as
if
it
were
next
door
to
his
chambers
and
returns
to
his
chambers
as
if
he
had
never
been
out
of
lincoln
inn
fields
he
neither
changes
his
dress
before
the
journey
nor
talks
of
it
afterwards
he
melted
out
of
his
this
morning
just
as
now
in
the
late
twilight
he
melts
into
his
own
square
like
a
dingy
london
bird
among
the
birds
at
roost
in
these
pleasant
fields
where
the
sheep
are
all
made
into
parchment
the
goats
into
wigs
and
the
pasture
into
chaff
the
lawyer
and
faded
dwelling
among
mankind
but
not
consorting
with
them
aged
without
experience
of
genial
youth
and
so
long
used
to
make
his
cramped
nest
in
holes
and
corners
of
human
nature
that
he
has
forgotten
its
broader
and
better
range
comes
sauntering
home
in
the
oven
made
by
the
hot
pavements
and
hot
buildings
he
has
baked
himself
dryer
than
usual
and
he
has
in
his
thirsty
mind
his
mellowed
half
a
century
old
the
lamplighter
is
skipping
up
and
down
his
ladder
on
tulkinghorn
side
of
the
fields
when
that
of
noble
mysteries
arrives
at
his
own
dull
he
ascends
the
and
is
gliding
into
the
dusky
hall
when
he
encounters
on
the
top
step
a
bowing
and
propitiatory
little
man
is
that
snagsby
yes
sir
i
hope
you
are
well
sir
i
was
just
giving
you
up
sir
and
going
home
aye
what
is
it
what
do
you
want
with
me
well
sir
says
snagsby
holding
his
hat
at
the
side
of
his
head
in
his
deference
towards
his
best
customer
i
was
wishful
to
say
a
word
to
you
sir
can
you
say
it
here
perfectly
sir
say
it
then
the
lawyer
turns
leans
his
arms
on
the
iron
railing
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
looks
at
the
lamplighter
lighting
the
it
is
relating
says
snagsby
in
a
mysterious
low
voice
it
is
relating
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
to
the
foreigner
sir
tulkinghorn
eyes
him
with
some
surprise
what
foreigner
the
foreign
female
sir
french
if
i
do
mistake
i
am
not
acquainted
with
that
language
myself
but
i
should
judge
from
her
manners
and
appearance
that
she
was
french
anyways
certainly
foreign
her
that
was
upstairs
sir
when
bucket
and
me
had
the
honour
of
waiting
upon
you
with
the
that
night
oh
yes
yes
mademoiselle
hortense
indeed
sir
snagsby
coughs
his
cough
of
submission
behind
his
hat
i
am
not
acquainted
myself
with
the
names
of
foreigners
in
general
but
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
be
that
snagsby
appears
to
have
set
out
in
this
reply
with
some
desperate
design
of
repeating
the
name
but
on
reflection
coughs
again
to
excuse
himself
and
what
can
you
have
to
say
snagsby
demands
tulkinghorn
about
her
well
sir
returns
the
stationer
shading
his
communication
with
his
hat
it
falls
a
little
hard
upon
me
my
domestic
happiness
is
very
great
at
least
it
as
great
as
can
be
expected
i
sure
but
my
little
woman
is
rather
given
to
jealousy
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
she
is
very
much
given
to
jealousy
and
you
see
a
foreign
female
of
that
genteel
appearance
coming
into
the
shop
and
hovering
i
should
be
the
last
to
make
use
of
a
strong
expression
if
i
could
avoid
it
but
hovering
sir
in
the
court
you
know
it
is
now
ai
it
i
only
put
it
to
yourself
sir
snagsby
having
said
this
in
a
very
plaintive
manner
throws
in
a
cough
of
general
application
to
fill
up
all
the
blanks
why
what
do
you
mean
asks
tulkinghorn
just
so
sir
returns
snagsby
i
was
sure
you
would
feel
it
yourself
and
would
excuse
the
reasonableness
of
my
feelings
when
coupled
with
the
known
excitableness
of
my
little
woman
you
see
the
foreign
female
which
you
mentioned
her
name
just
now
with
quite
a
native
sound
i
am
sure
caught
up
the
word
snagsby
that
night
being
uncommon
quick
and
made
inquiry
and
got
the
direction
and
come
at
now
guster
our
young
woman
is
timid
and
has
fits
and
she
taking
fright
at
the
foreigner
looks
which
are
fierce
and
at
a
grinding
manner
that
she
has
of
speaking
which
is
calculated
to
alarm
a
weak
mind
gave
way
to
it
instead
of
bearing
up
against
it
and
tumbled
down
the
kitchen
stairs
out
of
one
into
another
such
fits
as
i
do
sometimes
think
are
never
gone
into
or
come
out
of
in
any
house
but
ours
consequently
there
was
by
good
fortune
ample
occupation
for
my
little
woman
and
only
me
to
answer
the
shop
when
she
did
say
that
tulkinghorn
being
always
denied
to
her
by
his
employer
which
i
had
no
doubt
at
the
time
was
a
foreign
mode
of
viewing
a
clerk
she
would
do
herself
the
pleasure
of
continually
calling
at
my
place
until
she
was
let
in
here
since
then
she
has
been
as
i
began
by
saying
hovering
hovering
sir
snagsby
repeats
the
word
with
pathetic
emphasis
in
the
court
the
effects
of
which
movement
it
is
impossible
to
calculate
i
should
wonder
if
it
might
have
already
given
rise
to
the
painfullest
mistakes
even
in
the
neighbours
minds
not
mentioning
if
such
a
thing
was
possible
my
little
woman
whereas
goodness
knows
says
snagsby
shaking
his
head
i
never
had
an
idea
of
a
foreign
female
except
as
being
formerly
connected
with
a
bunch
of
brooms
and
a
baby
or
at
the
present
time
with
a
tambourine
and
earrings
i
never
had
i
do
assure
you
sir
tulkinghorn
had
listened
gravely
to
this
complaint
and
inquires
when
the
stationer
has
finished
and
that
all
is
it
snagsby
why
yes
sir
that
all
says
snagsby
ending
with
a
cough
that
plainly
adds
and
it
enough
too
for
me
i
do
know
what
mademoiselle
hortense
may
want
or
mean
unless
she
is
mad
says
the
lawyer
even
if
she
was
you
know
sir
snagsby
pleads
it
would
be
a
consolation
to
have
some
weapon
or
another
in
the
form
of
a
foreign
dagger
planted
in
the
family
no
says
the
other
well
well
this
shall
be
stopped
i
am
sorry
you
have
been
inconvenienced
if
she
comes
again
send
her
here
snagsby
with
much
bowing
and
short
apologetic
coughing
takes
his
leave
lightened
in
heart
tulkinghorn
goes
upstairs
saying
to
himself
these
women
were
created
to
give
trouble
the
whole
earth
over
the
mistress
not
being
enough
to
deal
with
here
the
maid
now
but
i
will
be
short
with
this
jade
at
least
so
saying
he
unlocks
his
door
gropes
his
way
into
his
murky
rooms
lights
his
candles
and
looks
about
him
it
is
too
dark
to
see
much
of
the
allegory
overhead
there
but
that
importunate
roman
who
is
for
ever
toppling
out
of
the
clouds
and
pointing
is
at
his
old
work
pretty
distinctly
not
honouring
him
with
much
attention
tulkinghorn
takes
a
small
key
from
his
pocket
unlocks
a
drawer
in
which
there
is
another
key
which
unlocks
a
chest
in
which
there
is
another
and
so
comes
to
the
with
which
he
prepares
to
descend
to
the
regions
of
old
wine
he
is
going
towards
the
door
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
when
a
knock
comes
who
this
aye
aye
mistress
it
you
is
it
you
appear
at
a
good
time
i
have
just
been
hearing
of
you
now
what
do
you
want
he
stands
the
candle
on
the
in
the
clerk
hall
and
taps
his
dry
cheek
with
the
key
as
he
addresses
these
words
of
welcome
to
mademoiselle
hortense
that
feline
personage
with
her
lips
tightly
shut
and
her
eyes
looking
out
at
him
sideways
softly
closes
the
door
before
replying
i
have
had
great
deal
of
trouble
to
find
you
sir
have
you
i
have
been
here
very
often
sir
it
has
always
been
said
to
me
he
is
not
at
home
he
is
engage
he
is
this
and
that
he
is
not
for
you
quite
right
and
quite
true
not
true
lies
at
times
there
is
a
suddenness
in
the
manner
of
mademoiselle
hortense
so
like
a
bodily
spring
upon
the
subject
of
it
that
such
subject
involuntarily
starts
and
fails
back
it
is
tulkinghorn
case
at
present
though
mademoiselle
hortense
with
her
eyes
almost
shut
up
but
still
looking
out
sideways
is
only
smiling
contemptuously
and
shaking
her
head
now
mistress
says
the
lawyer
tapping
the
key
hastily
upon
the
if
you
have
anything
to
say
say
it
say
it
sir
you
have
not
use
me
well
you
have
been
mean
and
shabby
mean
and
shabby
eh
returns
the
lawyer
rubbing
his
nose
with
the
key
yes
what
is
it
that
i
tell
you
you
know
you
have
you
have
attrapped
me
catched
me
to
give
you
information
you
have
asked
me
to
show
you
the
dress
of
mine
my
lady
must
have
wore
that
night
you
have
prayed
me
to
come
in
it
here
to
meet
that
boy
say
is
it
not
mademoiselle
hortense
makes
another
spring
you
are
a
vixen
a
vixen
tulkinghorn
seems
to
meditate
as
he
looks
distrustfully
at
her
then
he
replies
well
wench
well
i
paid
you
you
paid
me
she
repeats
with
fierce
disdain
two
sovereign
i
have
not
change
them
i
them
i
them
i
throw
them
from
me
which
she
literally
does
taking
them
out
of
her
bosom
as
she
speaks
and
flinging
them
with
such
violence
on
the
floor
that
they
jerk
up
again
into
the
light
before
they
roll
away
into
corners
and
slowly
settle
down
there
after
spinning
vehemently
now
says
mademoiselle
hortense
darkening
her
large
eyes
again
you
have
paid
me
eh
my
god
oh
yes
tulkinghorn
rubs
his
head
with
the
key
while
she
entertains
herself
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
you
must
be
rich
my
fair
friend
he
composedly
observes
to
throw
money
about
in
that
way
i
am
rich
she
returns
i
am
very
rich
in
hate
i
hate
my
lady
of
all
my
heart
you
know
that
know
it
how
should
i
know
it
because
you
have
known
it
perfectly
before
you
prayed
me
to
give
you
that
information
because
you
have
known
perfectly
that
i
was
it
appears
impossible
for
mademoiselle
to
roll
the
letter
r
sufficiently
in
this
word
notwithstanding
that
she
assists
her
energetic
delivery
by
clenching
both
her
hands
and
setting
all
her
teeth
oh
i
knew
that
did
i
says
tulkinghorn
examining
the
wards
of
the
key
yes
without
doubt
i
am
not
blind
you
have
made
sure
of
me
because
you
knew
that
you
had
reason
i
her
mademoiselle
hortense
folds
her
arms
and
throws
this
last
remark
at
him
over
one
of
her
shoulders
having
said
this
have
you
anything
else
to
say
mademoiselle
i
am
not
yet
placed
place
me
well
find
me
a
good
condition
if
you
can
not
or
do
not
choose
to
do
that
employ
me
to
pursue
her
to
chase
her
to
disgrace
and
to
dishonour
her
i
will
help
you
well
and
with
a
good
will
it
is
what
you
do
do
i
not
know
that
you
appear
to
know
a
good
deal
tulkinghorn
retorts
do
i
not
is
it
that
i
am
so
weak
as
to
believe
like
a
child
that
i
come
here
in
that
dress
to
that
boy
only
to
decide
a
little
bet
a
wager
eh
my
god
oh
yes
in
this
reply
down
to
the
word
wager
inclusive
mademoiselle
has
been
ironically
polite
and
tender
then
as
suddenly
dashed
into
the
bitterest
and
most
defiant
scorn
with
her
black
eyes
in
one
and
the
same
moment
very
nearly
shut
and
staringly
wide
open
now
let
us
see
says
tulkinghorn
tapping
his
chin
with
the
key
and
looking
imperturbably
at
her
how
this
matter
stands
ah
let
us
see
mademoiselle
assents
with
many
angry
and
tight
nods
of
her
head
you
come
here
to
make
a
remarkably
modest
demand
which
you
have
just
stated
and
it
not
being
conceded
you
will
come
again
and
again
says
mademoiselle
with
more
tight
and
angry
nods
and
yet
again
and
yet
again
and
many
times
again
in
effect
for
ever
and
not
only
here
but
you
will
go
to
snagsby
too
perhaps
that
visit
not
succeeding
either
you
will
go
again
perhaps
and
again
repeats
mademoiselle
cataleptic
with
determination
and
yet
again
and
yet
again
and
many
times
again
in
effect
for
ever
very
well
now
mademoiselle
hortense
let
me
recommend
you
to
take
the
candle
and
pick
up
that
money
of
yours
i
think
you
will
find
it
behind
the
clerk
partition
in
the
corner
yonder
she
merely
throws
a
laugh
over
her
shoulder
and
stands
her
ground
with
folded
arms
you
will
not
eh
no
i
will
not
so
much
the
poorer
you
so
much
the
richer
i
look
mistress
this
is
the
key
of
my
it
is
a
large
key
but
the
keys
of
prisons
are
larger
in
this
city
there
are
houses
of
correction
where
the
treadmills
are
for
women
the
gates
of
which
are
very
strong
and
heavy
and
no
doubt
the
keys
too
i
am
afraid
a
lady
of
your
spirit
and
activity
would
find
it
an
inconvenience
to
have
one
of
those
keys
turned
upon
her
for
any
length
of
time
what
do
you
think
i
think
mademoiselle
replies
without
any
action
and
in
a
clear
obliging
voice
that
you
are
a
miserable
wretch
probably
returns
tulkinghorn
quietly
blowing
his
nose
but
i
do
ask
what
you
think
of
myself
i
ask
what
you
think
of
the
prison
nothing
what
does
it
matter
to
me
why
it
matters
this
much
mistress
says
the
lawyer
deliberately
putting
away
his
handkerchief
and
adjusting
his
frill
the
law
is
so
despotic
here
that
it
interferes
to
prevent
any
of
our
good
english
citizens
from
being
troubled
even
by
a
lady
visits
against
his
desire
and
on
his
complaining
that
he
is
so
troubled
it
takes
hold
of
the
troublesome
lady
and
shuts
her
up
in
prison
under
hard
discipline
turns
the
key
upon
her
mistress
illustrating
with
the
truly
returns
mademoiselle
in
the
same
pleasant
voice
that
is
droll
but
my
faith
still
what
does
it
matter
to
me
my
fair
friend
says
tulkinghorn
make
another
visit
here
or
at
snagsby
and
you
shall
learn
in
that
case
you
will
send
me
to
the
prison
perhaps
perhaps
it
would
be
contradictory
for
one
in
mademoiselle
state
of
agreeable
jocularity
to
foam
at
the
mouth
otherwise
a
tigerish
expansion
thereabouts
might
look
as
if
a
very
little
more
would
make
her
do
it
in
a
word
mistress
says
tulkinghorn
i
am
sorry
to
be
unpolite
but
if
you
ever
present
yourself
uninvited
here
or
there
again
i
will
give
you
over
to
the
police
their
gallantry
is
great
but
they
carry
troublesome
people
through
the
streets
in
an
ignominious
manner
strapped
down
on
a
board
my
good
wench
i
will
prove
you
whispers
mademoiselle
stretching
out
her
hand
i
will
try
if
you
dare
to
do
it
and
if
pursues
the
lawyer
without
minding
her
i
place
you
in
that
good
condition
of
being
locked
up
in
jail
it
will
be
some
time
before
you
find
yourself
at
liberty
again
i
will
prove
you
repeats
mademoiselle
in
her
former
whisper
and
now
proceeds
the
lawyer
still
without
minding
her
you
had
better
go
think
twice
before
you
come
here
again
think
you
she
answers
twice
two
hundred
times
you
were
dismissed
by
your
lady
you
know
tulkinghorn
observes
following
her
out
upon
the
staircase
as
the
most
implacable
and
unmanageable
of
women
now
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
take
warning
by
what
i
say
to
you
for
what
i
say
i
mean
and
what
i
threaten
i
will
do
mistress
she
goes
down
without
answering
or
looking
behind
her
when
she
is
gone
he
goes
down
too
and
returning
with
his
bottle
devotes
himself
to
a
leisurely
enjoyment
of
its
contents
now
and
then
as
he
throws
his
head
back
in
his
chair
catching
sight
of
the
pertinacious
roman
pointing
from
the
ceiling
chapter
xliii
esther
narrative
it
matters
little
now
how
much
i
thought
of
my
living
mother
who
had
told
me
evermore
to
consider
her
dead
i
could
not
venture
to
approach
her
or
to
communicate
with
her
in
writing
for
my
sense
of
the
peril
in
which
her
life
was
passed
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
my
fears
of
increasing
it
knowing
that
my
mere
existence
as
a
living
creature
was
an
unforeseen
danger
in
her
way
i
could
not
always
conquer
that
terror
of
myself
which
had
seized
me
when
i
first
knew
the
secret
at
no
time
did
i
dare
to
utter
her
name
i
felt
as
if
i
did
not
even
dare
to
hear
it
if
the
conversation
anywhere
when
i
was
present
took
that
direction
as
it
sometimes
naturally
did
i
tried
not
to
hear
i
mentally
counted
repeated
something
that
i
knew
or
went
out
of
the
room
i
am
conscious
now
that
i
often
did
these
things
when
there
can
have
been
no
danger
of
her
being
spoken
of
but
i
did
them
in
the
dread
i
had
of
hearing
anything
that
might
lead
to
her
betrayal
and
to
her
betrayal
through
me
it
matters
little
now
how
often
i
recalled
the
tones
of
my
voice
wondered
whether
i
should
ever
hear
it
again
as
i
so
longed
to
do
and
thought
how
strange
and
desolate
it
was
that
it
should
be
so
new
to
me
it
matters
little
that
i
watched
for
every
public
mention
of
my
mother
name
that
i
passed
and
repassed
the
door
of
her
house
in
town
loving
it
but
afraid
to
look
at
it
that
i
once
sat
in
the
theatre
when
my
mother
was
there
and
saw
me
and
when
we
were
so
wide
asunder
before
the
great
company
of
all
degrees
that
any
link
or
confidence
between
us
seemed
a
dream
it
is
all
all
over
my
lot
has
been
so
blest
that
i
can
relate
little
of
myself
which
is
not
a
story
of
goodness
and
generosity
in
others
i
may
well
pass
that
little
and
go
on
when
we
were
settled
at
home
again
ada
and
i
had
many
conversations
with
my
guardian
of
which
richard
was
the
theme
my
dear
girl
was
deeply
grieved
that
he
should
do
their
kind
cousin
so
much
wrong
but
she
was
so
faithful
to
richard
that
she
could
not
bear
to
blame
him
even
for
that
my
guardian
was
assured
of
it
and
never
coupled
his
name
with
a
word
of
reproof
rick
is
mistaken
my
dear
he
would
say
to
her
well
well
we
have
all
been
mistaken
over
and
over
again
we
must
trust
to
you
and
time
to
set
him
right
we
knew
afterwards
what
we
suspected
then
that
he
did
not
trust
to
time
until
he
had
often
tried
to
open
richard
eyes
that
he
had
written
to
him
gone
to
him
talked
with
him
tried
every
gentle
and
persuasive
art
his
kindness
could
devise
our
poor
devoted
richard
was
deaf
and
blind
to
all
if
he
were
wrong
he
would
make
amends
when
the
chancery
suit
was
over
if
he
were
groping
in
the
dark
he
could
not
do
better
than
do
his
utmost
to
clear
away
those
clouds
in
which
so
much
was
confused
and
obscured
suspicion
and
misunderstanding
were
the
fault
of
the
suit
then
let
him
work
the
suit
out
and
come
through
it
to
his
right
mind
this
was
his
unvarying
reply
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
had
obtained
such
possession
of
his
whole
nature
that
it
was
impossible
to
place
any
consideration
before
him
which
he
did
not
with
a
distorted
kind
of
reason
make
a
new
argument
in
favour
of
his
doing
what
he
did
so
that
it
is
even
more
mischievous
said
my
guardian
once
to
me
to
remonstrate
with
the
poor
dear
fellow
than
to
leave
him
alone
i
took
one
of
these
opportunities
of
mentioning
my
doubts
of
skimpole
as
a
good
adviser
for
richard
adviser
returned
my
guardian
laughing
my
dear
who
would
advise
with
skimpole
encourager
would
perhaps
have
been
a
better
word
said
i
encourager
returned
my
guardian
again
who
could
be
encouraged
by
skimpole
not
richard
i
asked
no
he
replied
such
an
unworldly
uncalculating
gossamer
creature
is
a
relief
to
him
and
an
amusement
but
as
to
advising
or
encouraging
or
occupying
a
serious
station
towards
anybody
or
anything
it
is
simply
not
to
be
thought
of
in
such
a
child
as
skimpole
pray
cousin
john
said
ada
who
had
just
joined
us
and
now
looked
over
my
shoulder
what
made
him
such
a
child
what
made
him
such
a
child
inquired
my
guardian
rubbing
his
head
a
little
at
a
loss
yes
cousin
john
why
he
slowly
replied
roughening
his
head
more
and
more
he
is
all
sentiment
and
and
susceptibility
and
and
sensibility
and
and
imagination
and
these
qualities
are
not
regulated
in
him
somehow
i
suppose
the
people
who
admired
him
for
them
in
his
youth
attached
too
much
importance
to
them
and
too
little
to
any
training
that
would
have
balanced
and
adjusted
them
and
so
he
became
what
he
is
hey
said
my
guardian
stopping
short
and
looking
at
us
hopefully
what
do
you
think
you
two
ada
glancing
at
me
said
she
thought
it
was
a
pity
he
should
be
an
expense
to
richard
so
it
is
so
it
is
returned
my
guardian
hurriedly
that
must
not
be
we
must
arrange
that
i
must
prevent
it
that
will
never
do
and
i
said
i
thought
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
he
had
ever
introduced
richard
to
vholes
for
a
present
of
five
pounds
did
he
said
my
guardian
with
a
passing
shade
of
vexation
on
his
face
but
there
you
have
the
man
there
you
have
the
man
there
is
nothing
mercenary
in
that
with
him
he
has
no
idea
of
the
value
of
money
he
introduces
rick
and
then
he
is
good
friends
with
vholes
and
borrows
five
pounds
of
him
he
means
nothing
by
it
and
thinks
nothing
of
it
he
told
you
himself
i
be
bound
my
dear
oh
yes
said
i
exactly
cried
my
guardian
quite
triumphant
there
you
have
the
man
if
he
had
meant
any
harm
by
it
or
was
conscious
of
any
harm
in
it
he
would
tell
it
he
tells
it
as
he
does
it
in
mere
simplicity
but
you
shall
see
him
in
his
own
home
and
then
understand
him
better
we
must
pay
a
visit
to
harold
skimpole
and
caution
him
on
these
points
lord
bless
you
my
dears
an
infant
an
infant
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
we
went
into
london
on
an
early
day
and
presented
ourselves
at
skimpole
door
he
lived
in
a
place
called
the
polygon
in
somers
town
where
there
were
at
that
time
a
number
of
poor
spanish
refugees
walking
about
in
cloaks
smoking
little
paper
cigars
whether
he
was
a
better
tenant
than
one
might
have
supposed
in
consequence
of
his
friend
somebody
always
paying
his
rent
at
last
or
whether
his
inaptitude
for
business
rendered
it
particularly
difficult
to
turn
him
out
i
know
but
he
had
occupied
the
same
house
some
years
it
was
in
a
state
of
dilapidation
quite
equal
to
our
expectation
two
or
three
of
the
area
railings
were
gone
the
was
broken
the
knocker
was
loose
the
had
been
pulled
off
a
long
time
to
judge
from
the
rusty
state
of
the
wire
and
dirty
footprints
on
the
steps
were
the
only
signs
of
its
being
inhabited
a
slatternly
girl
who
seemed
to
be
bursting
out
at
the
rents
in
her
gown
and
the
cracks
in
her
shoes
like
an
berry
answered
our
knock
by
opening
the
door
a
very
little
way
and
stopping
up
the
gap
with
her
figure
as
she
knew
jarndyce
indeed
ada
and
i
both
thought
that
she
evidently
associated
him
with
the
receipt
of
her
wages
she
immediately
relented
and
allowed
us
to
pass
in
the
lock
of
the
door
being
in
a
disabled
condition
she
then
applied
herself
to
securing
it
with
the
chain
which
was
not
in
good
action
either
and
said
would
we
go
upstairs
we
went
upstairs
to
the
first
floor
still
seeing
no
other
furniture
than
the
dirty
footprints
jarndyce
without
further
ceremony
entered
a
room
there
and
we
followed
it
was
dingy
enough
and
not
at
all
clean
but
furnished
with
an
odd
kind
of
shabby
luxury
with
a
large
footstool
a
sofa
and
plenty
of
cushions
an
and
plenty
of
pillows
a
piano
books
drawing
materials
music
newspapers
and
a
few
sketches
and
pictures
a
broken
pane
of
glass
in
one
of
the
dirty
windows
was
papered
and
wafered
over
but
there
was
a
little
plate
of
hothouse
nectarines
on
the
table
and
there
was
another
of
grapes
and
another
of
and
there
was
a
bottle
of
light
wine
skimpole
himself
reclined
upon
the
sofa
in
a
drinking
some
fragrant
coffee
from
an
old
china
cup
it
was
then
about
and
looking
at
a
collection
of
wallflowers
in
the
balcony
he
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
by
our
appearance
but
rose
and
received
us
in
his
usual
airy
manner
here
i
am
you
see
he
said
when
we
were
seated
not
without
some
little
difficulty
the
greater
part
of
the
chairs
being
broken
here
i
am
this
is
my
frugal
breakfast
some
men
want
legs
of
beef
and
mutton
for
breakfast
i
do
give
me
my
peach
my
cup
of
coffee
and
my
claret
i
am
content
i
do
want
them
for
themselves
but
they
remind
me
of
the
sun
there
nothing
solar
about
legs
of
beef
and
mutton
mere
animal
satisfaction
this
is
our
friend
or
would
be
if
he
ever
prescribed
his
sanctum
his
studio
said
my
guardian
to
us
yes
said
skimpole
turning
his
bright
face
about
this
is
the
bird
cage
this
is
where
the
bird
lives
and
sings
they
pluck
his
feathers
now
and
then
and
clip
his
wings
but
he
sings
he
sings
he
handed
us
the
grapes
repeating
in
his
radiant
way
he
sings
not
an
ambitious
note
but
still
he
sings
these
are
very
fine
said
my
guardian
a
present
no
he
answered
no
some
amiable
gardener
sells
them
his
man
wanted
to
know
when
he
brought
them
last
evening
whether
he
should
wait
for
the
money
my
friend
i
said
think
not
if
your
time
is
of
any
value
to
you
i
suppose
it
was
for
he
went
away
my
guardian
looked
at
us
with
a
smile
as
though
he
asked
us
is
it
possible
to
be
worldly
with
this
baby
this
is
a
day
said
skimpole
gaily
taking
a
little
claret
in
a
tumbler
that
will
ever
be
remembered
here
we
shall
call
it
saint
clare
and
saint
summerson
day
you
must
see
my
daughters
i
have
a
daughter
who
is
my
beauty
daughter
i
have
a
sentiment
daughter
and
i
have
a
comedy
daughter
you
must
see
them
all
they
be
enchanted
he
was
going
to
summon
them
when
my
guardian
interposed
and
asked
him
to
pause
a
moment
as
he
wished
to
say
a
word
to
him
first
my
dear
jarndyce
he
cheerfully
replied
going
back
to
his
sofa
as
many
moments
as
you
please
time
is
no
object
here
we
never
know
what
it
is
and
we
never
care
not
the
way
to
get
on
in
life
you
tell
me
certainly
but
we
do
get
on
in
life
we
pretend
to
do
it
my
guardian
looked
at
us
again
plainly
saying
you
hear
him
now
harold
he
began
the
word
i
have
to
say
relates
to
rick
the
dearest
friend
i
have
returned
skimpole
cordially
i
suppose
he
ought
not
to
be
my
dearest
friend
as
he
is
not
on
terms
with
you
but
he
is
i
ca
help
it
he
is
full
of
youthful
poetry
and
i
love
him
if
you
do
like
it
i
ca
help
it
i
love
him
the
engaging
frankness
with
which
he
made
this
declaration
really
had
a
disinterested
appearance
and
captivated
my
guardian
if
not
for
the
moment
ada
too
you
are
welcome
to
love
him
as
much
as
you
like
returned
jarndyce
but
we
must
save
his
pocket
harold
oh
said
skimpole
his
pocket
now
you
are
coming
to
what
i
do
understand
taking
a
little
more
claret
and
dipping
one
of
the
cakes
in
it
he
shook
his
head
and
smiled
at
ada
and
me
with
an
ingenuous
foreboding
that
he
never
could
be
made
to
understand
if
you
go
with
him
here
or
there
said
my
guardian
plainly
you
must
not
let
him
pay
for
both
my
dear
jarndyce
returned
skimpole
his
genial
face
irradiated
by
the
comicality
of
this
idea
what
am
i
to
do
if
he
takes
me
anywhere
i
must
go
and
how
can
i
pay
i
never
have
any
money
if
i
had
any
money
i
do
know
anything
about
it
suppose
i
say
to
a
man
how
much
suppose
the
man
says
to
me
seven
and
sixpence
i
know
nothing
about
seven
and
sixpence
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
pursue
the
subject
with
any
consideration
for
the
man
i
do
go
about
asking
busy
people
what
seven
and
sixpence
is
in
moorish
which
i
do
understand
why
should
i
go
about
asking
them
what
seven
and
sixpence
is
in
money
which
i
do
understand
well
said
my
guardian
by
no
means
displeased
with
this
artless
reply
if
you
come
to
any
kind
of
journeying
with
rick
you
must
borrow
the
money
of
me
never
breathing
the
least
allusion
to
that
circumstance
and
leave
the
calculation
to
him
my
dear
jarndyce
returned
skimpole
i
will
do
anything
to
give
you
pleasure
but
it
seems
an
idle
form
a
superstition
besides
i
give
you
my
word
miss
clare
and
my
dear
miss
summerson
i
thought
carstone
was
immensely
rich
i
thought
he
had
only
to
make
over
something
or
to
sign
a
bond
or
a
draft
or
a
cheque
or
a
bill
or
to
put
something
on
a
file
somewhere
to
bring
down
a
shower
of
money
indeed
it
is
not
so
sir
said
ada
he
is
poor
no
really
returned
skimpole
with
his
bright
smile
you
surprise
me
and
not
being
the
richer
for
trusting
in
a
rotten
reed
said
my
guardian
laying
his
hand
emphatically
on
the
sleeve
of
skimpole
be
you
very
careful
not
to
encourage
him
in
that
reliance
harold
my
dear
good
friend
returned
skimpole
and
my
dear
miss
simmerson
and
my
dear
miss
clare
how
can
i
do
that
it
business
and
i
do
know
business
it
is
he
who
encourages
me
he
emerges
from
great
feats
of
business
presents
the
brightest
prospects
before
me
as
their
result
and
calls
upon
me
to
admire
them
i
do
admire
them
as
bright
prospects
but
i
know
no
more
about
them
and
i
tell
him
so
the
helpless
kind
of
candour
with
which
he
presented
this
before
us
the
manner
in
which
he
was
amused
by
his
innocence
the
fantastic
way
in
which
he
took
himself
under
his
own
protection
and
argued
about
that
curious
person
combined
with
the
delightful
ease
of
everything
he
said
exactly
to
make
out
my
guardian
case
the
more
i
saw
of
him
the
more
unlikely
it
seemed
to
me
when
he
was
present
that
he
could
design
conceal
or
influence
anything
and
yet
the
less
likely
that
appeared
when
he
was
not
present
and
the
less
agreeable
it
was
to
think
of
his
having
anything
to
do
with
any
one
for
whom
i
cared
hearing
that
his
examination
as
he
called
it
was
now
over
skimpole
left
the
room
with
a
radiant
face
to
fetch
his
daughters
his
sons
had
run
away
at
various
times
leaving
my
guardian
quite
delighted
by
the
manner
in
which
he
had
vindicated
his
childish
character
he
soon
came
back
bringing
with
him
the
three
young
ladies
and
skimpole
who
had
once
been
a
beauty
but
was
now
a
delicate
invalid
suffering
under
a
complication
of
disorders
this
said
skimpole
is
my
beauty
daughter
arethusa
plays
and
sings
odds
and
ends
like
her
father
this
is
my
sentiment
daughter
laura
plays
a
little
but
do
sing
this
is
my
comedy
daughter
kitty
sings
a
little
but
do
play
we
all
draw
a
little
and
compose
a
little
and
none
of
us
have
any
idea
of
time
or
money
skimpole
sighed
i
thought
as
if
she
would
have
been
glad
to
strike
out
this
item
in
the
family
attainments
i
also
thought
that
she
rather
impressed
her
sigh
upon
my
guardian
and
that
she
took
every
opportunity
of
throwing
in
another
it
is
pleasant
said
skimpole
turning
his
sprightly
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
and
it
is
whimsically
interesting
to
trace
peculiarities
in
families
in
this
family
we
are
all
children
and
i
am
the
youngest
the
daughters
who
appeared
to
be
very
fond
of
him
were
amused
by
this
droll
fact
particularly
the
comedy
daughter
my
dears
it
is
true
said
skimpole
is
it
not
so
it
is
and
so
it
must
be
because
like
the
dogs
in
the
hymn
is
our
nature
to
now
here
is
miss
summerson
with
a
fine
administrative
capacity
and
a
knowledge
of
details
perfectly
surprising
it
will
sound
very
strange
in
miss
summerson
ears
i
dare
say
that
we
know
nothing
about
chops
in
this
house
but
we
do
not
the
least
we
ca
cook
anything
whatever
a
needle
and
thread
we
do
know
how
to
use
we
admire
the
people
who
possess
the
practical
wisdom
we
want
but
we
do
quarrel
with
them
then
why
should
they
quarrel
with
us
live
and
let
live
we
say
to
them
live
upon
your
practical
wisdom
and
let
us
live
upon
you
he
laughed
but
as
usual
seemed
quite
candid
and
really
to
mean
what
he
said
we
have
sympathy
my
roses
said
skimpole
sympathy
for
everything
have
we
not
oh
yes
papa
cried
the
three
daughters
in
fact
that
is
our
family
department
said
skimpole
in
this
of
life
we
are
capable
of
looking
on
and
of
being
interested
and
we
do
look
on
and
we
are
interested
what
more
can
we
do
here
is
my
beauty
daughter
married
these
three
years
now
i
dare
say
her
marrying
another
child
and
having
two
more
was
all
wrong
in
point
of
political
economy
but
it
was
very
agreeable
we
had
our
little
festivities
on
those
occasions
and
exchanged
social
ideas
she
brought
her
young
husband
home
one
day
and
they
and
their
young
fledglings
have
their
nest
upstairs
i
dare
say
at
some
time
or
other
sentiment
and
comedy
will
bring
their
husbands
home
and
have
their
nests
upstairs
too
so
we
get
on
we
do
know
how
but
somehow
she
looked
very
young
indeed
to
be
the
mother
of
two
children
and
i
could
not
help
pitying
both
her
and
them
it
was
evident
that
the
three
daughters
had
grown
up
as
they
could
and
had
had
just
as
little
haphazard
instruction
as
qualified
them
to
be
their
playthings
in
his
idlest
hours
his
pictorial
tastes
were
consulted
i
observed
in
their
respective
styles
of
wearing
their
hair
the
beauty
daughter
being
in
the
classic
manner
the
sentiment
daughter
luxuriant
and
flowing
and
the
comedy
daughter
in
the
arch
style
with
a
good
deal
of
sprightly
forehead
and
vivacious
little
curls
dotted
about
the
corners
of
her
eyes
they
were
dressed
to
correspond
though
in
a
most
untidy
and
negligent
way
ada
and
i
conversed
with
these
young
ladies
and
found
them
wonderfully
like
their
father
in
the
meanwhile
jarndyce
who
had
been
rubbing
his
head
to
a
great
extent
and
hinted
at
a
change
in
the
wind
talked
with
skimpole
in
a
corner
where
we
could
not
help
hearing
the
chink
of
money
skimpole
had
previously
volunteered
to
go
home
with
us
and
had
withdrawn
to
dress
himself
for
the
purpose
my
roses
he
said
when
he
came
back
take
care
of
mama
she
is
poorly
by
going
home
with
jarndyce
for
a
day
or
two
i
shall
hear
the
larks
sing
and
preserve
my
amiability
it
has
been
tried
you
know
and
would
be
tried
again
if
i
remained
at
home
that
bad
man
said
the
comedy
daughter
at
the
very
time
when
he
knew
papa
was
lying
ill
by
his
wallflowers
looking
at
the
blue
sky
laura
complained
and
when
the
smell
of
hay
was
in
the
air
said
arethusa
it
showed
a
want
of
poetry
in
the
man
skimpole
assented
but
with
perfect
good
humour
it
was
coarse
there
was
an
absence
of
the
finer
touches
of
humanity
in
it
my
daughters
have
taken
great
offence
he
explained
to
us
at
an
honest
man
not
honest
papa
impossible
they
all
three
protested
at
a
rough
kind
of
fellow
a
sort
of
human
hedgehog
rolled
up
said
skimpole
who
is
a
baker
in
this
neighbourhood
and
from
whom
we
borrowed
a
couple
of
we
wanted
a
couple
of
and
we
had
got
them
and
therefore
of
course
we
looked
to
a
man
who
had
got
them
to
lend
them
well
this
morose
person
lent
them
and
we
wore
them
out
when
they
were
worn
out
he
wanted
them
back
he
had
them
back
he
was
contented
you
will
say
not
at
all
he
objected
to
their
being
worn
i
reasoned
with
him
and
pointed
out
his
mistake
i
said
you
at
your
time
of
life
be
so
headstrong
my
friend
as
to
persist
that
an
is
a
thing
to
put
upon
a
shelf
and
look
at
that
it
is
an
object
to
contemplate
to
survey
from
a
distance
to
consider
from
a
point
of
sight
do
you
know
that
these
were
borrowed
to
be
sat
upon
he
was
unreasonable
and
unpersuadable
and
used
intemperate
language
being
as
patient
as
i
am
at
this
minute
i
addressed
another
appeal
to
him
i
said
my
good
man
however
our
business
capacities
may
vary
we
are
all
children
of
one
great
mother
nature
on
this
blooming
summer
morning
here
you
see
me
i
was
on
the
sofa
flowers
before
me
fruit
upon
the
table
the
cloudless
sky
above
me
the
air
full
of
fragrance
contemplating
nature
i
entreat
you
by
our
common
brotherhood
not
to
interpose
between
me
and
a
subject
so
sublime
the
absurd
figure
of
an
angry
baker
but
he
did
said
skimpole
raising
his
laughing
eyes
in
playful
astonishment
he
did
interpose
that
ridiculous
figure
and
he
does
and
he
will
again
and
therefore
i
am
very
glad
to
get
out
of
his
way
and
to
go
home
with
my
friend
jarndyce
it
seemed
to
escape
his
consideration
that
skimpole
and
the
daughters
remained
behind
to
encounter
the
baker
but
this
was
so
old
a
story
to
all
of
them
that
it
had
become
a
matter
of
course
he
took
leave
of
his
family
with
a
tenderness
as
airy
and
graceful
as
any
other
aspect
in
which
he
showed
himself
and
rode
away
with
us
in
perfect
harmony
of
mind
we
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
through
some
open
doors
as
we
went
downstairs
that
his
own
apartment
was
a
palace
to
the
rest
of
the
house
i
could
have
no
anticipation
and
i
had
none
that
something
very
startling
to
me
at
the
moment
and
ever
memorable
to
me
in
what
ensued
from
it
was
to
happen
before
this
day
was
out
our
guest
was
in
such
spirits
on
the
way
home
that
i
could
do
nothing
but
listen
to
him
and
wonder
at
him
nor
was
i
alone
in
this
for
ada
yielded
to
the
same
fascination
as
to
my
guardian
the
wind
which
had
threatened
to
become
fixed
in
the
east
when
we
left
somers
town
veered
completely
round
before
we
were
a
couple
of
miles
from
it
whether
of
questionable
childishness
or
not
in
any
other
matters
skimpole
had
a
child
enjoyment
of
change
and
bright
weather
in
no
way
wearied
by
his
sallies
on
the
road
he
was
in
the
before
any
of
us
and
i
heard
him
at
the
piano
while
i
was
yet
looking
after
my
housekeeping
singing
refrains
of
barcaroles
and
drinking
songs
italian
and
german
by
the
score
we
were
all
assembled
shortly
before
dinner
and
he
was
still
at
the
piano
idly
picking
out
in
his
luxurious
way
little
strains
of
music
and
talking
between
whiles
of
finishing
some
sketches
of
the
ruined
old
verulam
wall
which
he
had
begun
a
year
or
two
ago
and
had
got
tired
of
when
a
card
was
brought
in
and
my
guardian
read
aloud
in
a
surprised
voice
sir
leicester
dedlock
the
visitor
was
in
the
room
while
it
was
yet
turning
round
with
me
and
before
i
had
the
power
to
stir
if
i
had
had
it
i
should
have
hurried
away
i
had
not
even
the
presence
of
mind
in
my
giddiness
to
retire
to
ada
in
the
window
or
to
see
the
window
or
to
know
where
it
was
i
heard
my
name
and
found
that
my
guardian
was
presenting
me
before
i
could
move
to
a
chair
pray
be
seated
sir
leicester
jarndyce
said
sir
leicester
in
reply
as
he
bowed
and
seated
himself
i
do
myself
the
honour
of
calling
here
you
do
me
the
honour
sir
leicester
thank
you
of
calling
here
on
my
road
from
lincolnshire
to
express
my
regret
that
any
cause
of
complaint
however
strong
that
i
may
have
against
a
gentleman
who
who
is
known
to
you
and
has
been
your
host
and
to
whom
therefore
i
will
make
no
farther
reference
should
have
prevented
you
still
more
ladies
under
your
escort
and
charge
from
seeing
whatever
little
there
may
be
to
gratify
a
polite
and
refined
taste
at
my
house
chesney
wold
you
are
exceedingly
obliging
sir
leicester
and
on
behalf
of
those
ladies
who
are
present
and
for
myself
i
thank
you
very
much
it
is
possible
jarndyce
that
the
gentleman
to
whom
for
the
reasons
i
have
mentioned
i
refrain
from
making
further
allusion
it
is
possible
jarndyce
that
that
gentleman
may
have
done
me
the
honour
so
far
to
misapprehend
my
character
as
to
induce
you
to
believe
that
you
would
not
have
been
received
by
my
local
establishment
in
lincolnshire
with
that
urbanity
that
courtesy
which
its
members
are
instructed
to
show
to
all
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
present
themselves
at
that
house
i
merely
beg
to
observe
sir
that
the
fact
is
the
reverse
my
guardian
delicately
dismissed
this
remark
without
making
any
verbal
answer
it
has
given
me
pain
jarndyce
sir
leicester
weightily
proceeded
i
assure
you
sir
it
has
given
me
pain
to
learn
from
the
housekeeper
at
chesney
wold
that
a
gentleman
who
was
in
your
company
in
that
part
of
the
county
and
who
would
appear
to
possess
a
cultivated
taste
for
the
fine
arts
was
likewise
deterred
by
some
such
cause
from
examining
the
family
pictures
with
that
leisure
that
attention
that
care
which
he
might
have
desired
to
bestow
upon
them
and
which
some
of
them
might
possibly
have
repaid
here
he
produced
a
card
and
read
with
much
gravity
and
a
little
trouble
through
his
hirrold
herald
harold
skampling
skumpling
i
beg
your
pardon
skimpole
this
is
harold
skimpole
said
my
guardian
evidently
surprised
oh
exclaimed
sir
leicester
i
am
happy
to
meet
skimpole
and
to
have
the
opportunity
of
tendering
my
personal
regrets
i
hope
sir
that
when
you
again
find
yourself
in
my
part
of
the
county
you
will
be
under
no
similar
sense
of
restraint
you
are
very
obliging
sir
leicester
dedlock
so
encouraged
i
shall
certainly
give
myself
the
pleasure
and
advantage
of
another
visit
to
your
beautiful
house
the
owners
of
such
places
as
chesney
wold
said
skimpole
with
his
usual
happy
and
easy
air
are
public
benefactors
they
are
good
enough
to
maintain
a
number
of
delightful
objects
for
the
admiration
and
pleasure
of
us
poor
men
and
not
to
reap
all
the
admiration
and
pleasure
that
they
yield
is
to
be
ungrateful
to
our
benefactors
sir
leicester
seemed
to
approve
of
this
sentiment
highly
an
artist
sir
no
returned
skimpole
a
perfectly
idle
man
a
mere
amateur
sir
leicester
seemed
to
approve
of
this
even
more
he
hoped
he
might
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
at
chesney
wold
when
skimpole
next
came
down
into
lincolnshire
skimpole
professed
himself
much
flattered
and
honoured
skimpole
mentioned
pursued
sir
leicester
addressing
himself
again
to
my
guardian
mentioned
to
the
housekeeper
who
as
he
may
have
observed
is
an
old
and
attached
retainer
of
the
family
that
is
when
i
walked
through
the
house
the
other
day
on
the
occasion
of
my
going
down
to
visit
miss
summerson
and
miss
clare
skimpole
airily
explained
to
us
that
the
friend
with
whom
he
had
formerly
been
staying
there
was
mr
jarndyce
sir
leicester
bowed
to
the
bearer
of
that
name
and
hence
i
became
aware
of
the
circumstance
for
which
i
have
professed
my
regret
that
this
should
have
occurred
to
any
gentleman
jarndyce
but
especially
a
gentleman
formerly
known
to
lady
dedlock
and
indeed
claiming
some
distant
connexion
with
her
and
for
whom
as
i
learn
from
my
lady
herself
she
entertains
a
high
respect
does
i
assure
you
give
me
pain
pray
say
no
more
about
it
sir
leicester
returned
my
guardian
i
am
very
sensible
as
i
am
sure
we
all
are
of
your
consideration
indeed
the
mistake
was
mine
and
i
ought
to
apologize
for
it
i
had
not
once
looked
up
i
had
not
seen
the
visitor
and
had
not
even
appeared
to
myself
to
hear
the
conversation
it
surprises
me
to
find
that
i
can
recall
it
for
it
seemed
to
make
no
impression
on
me
as
it
passed
i
heard
them
speaking
but
my
mind
was
so
confused
and
my
instinctive
avoidance
of
this
gentleman
made
his
presence
so
distressing
to
me
that
i
thought
i
understood
nothing
through
the
rushing
in
my
head
and
the
beating
of
my
heart
i
mentioned
the
subject
to
lady
dedlock
said
sir
leicester
rising
and
my
lady
informed
me
that
she
had
had
the
pleasure
of
exchanging
a
few
words
with
jarndyce
and
his
wards
on
the
occasion
of
an
accidental
meeting
during
their
sojourn
in
the
vicinity
permit
me
jarndyce
to
repeat
to
yourself
and
to
these
ladies
the
assurance
i
have
already
tendered
to
skimpole
circumstances
undoubtedly
prevent
my
saying
that
it
would
afford
me
any
gratification
to
hear
that
boythorn
had
favoured
my
house
with
his
presence
but
those
circumstances
are
confined
to
that
gentleman
himself
and
do
not
extend
beyond
him
you
know
my
old
opinion
of
him
said
skimpole
lightly
appealing
to
us
an
amiable
bull
who
is
determined
to
make
every
colour
scarlet
sir
leicester
dedlock
coughed
as
if
he
could
not
possibly
hear
another
word
in
reference
to
such
an
individual
and
took
his
leave
with
great
ceremony
and
politeness
i
got
to
my
own
room
with
all
possible
speed
and
remained
there
until
i
had
recovered
my
it
had
been
very
much
disturbed
but
i
was
thankful
to
find
when
i
went
downstairs
again
that
they
only
rallied
me
for
having
been
shy
and
mute
before
the
great
lincolnshire
baronet
by
that
time
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
the
period
was
come
when
i
must
tell
my
guardian
what
i
knew
the
possibility
of
my
being
brought
into
contact
with
my
mother
of
my
being
taken
to
her
house
even
of
skimpole
however
distantly
associated
with
me
receiving
kindnesses
and
obligations
from
her
husband
was
so
painful
that
i
felt
i
could
no
longer
guide
myself
without
his
assistance
when
we
had
retired
for
the
night
and
ada
and
i
had
had
our
usual
talk
in
our
pretty
room
i
went
out
at
my
door
again
and
sought
my
guardian
among
his
books
i
knew
he
always
read
at
that
hour
and
as
i
drew
near
i
saw
the
light
shining
out
into
the
passage
from
his
may
i
come
in
guardian
surely
little
woman
what
the
matter
nothing
is
the
matter
i
thought
i
would
like
to
take
this
quiet
time
of
saying
a
word
to
you
about
myself
he
put
a
chair
for
me
shut
his
book
and
put
it
by
and
turned
his
kind
attentive
face
towards
me
i
could
not
help
observing
that
it
wore
that
curious
expression
i
had
observed
in
it
once
before
on
that
night
when
he
had
said
that
he
was
in
no
trouble
which
i
could
readily
understand
what
concerns
you
my
dear
esther
said
he
concerns
us
all
you
can
not
be
more
ready
to
speak
than
i
am
to
hear
i
know
that
guardian
but
i
have
such
need
of
your
advice
and
support
oh
you
do
know
how
much
need
i
have
he
looked
unprepared
for
my
being
so
earnest
and
even
a
little
alarmed
or
how
anxious
i
have
been
to
speak
to
you
said
i
ever
since
the
visitor
was
here
the
visitor
my
dear
sir
leicester
dedlock
yes
he
folded
his
arms
and
sat
looking
at
me
with
an
air
of
the
profoundest
astonishment
awaiting
what
i
should
say
next
i
did
not
know
how
to
prepare
him
why
esther
said
he
breaking
into
a
smile
our
visitor
and
you
are
the
two
last
persons
on
earth
i
should
have
thought
of
connecting
together
oh
yes
guardian
i
know
it
and
i
too
but
a
little
while
ago
the
smile
passed
from
his
face
and
he
became
graver
than
before
he
crossed
to
the
door
to
see
that
it
was
shut
but
i
had
seen
to
that
and
resumed
his
seat
before
me
guardian
said
i
do
you
remember
when
we
were
overtaken
by
the
lady
dedlock
speaking
to
you
of
her
sister
of
course
of
course
i
do
and
reminding
you
that
she
and
her
sister
had
differed
had
gone
their
several
ways
of
course
why
did
they
separate
guardian
his
face
quite
altered
as
he
looked
at
me
my
child
what
questions
are
these
i
never
knew
no
one
but
themselves
ever
did
know
i
believe
who
could
tell
what
the
secrets
of
those
two
handsome
and
proud
women
were
you
have
seen
lady
dedlock
if
you
had
ever
seen
her
sister
you
would
know
her
to
have
been
as
resolute
and
haughty
as
she
oh
guardian
i
have
seen
her
many
and
many
a
time
seen
her
he
paused
a
little
biting
his
lip
then
esther
when
you
spoke
to
me
long
ago
of
boythorn
and
when
i
told
you
that
he
was
all
but
married
once
and
that
the
lady
did
not
die
but
died
to
him
and
that
that
time
had
had
its
influence
on
his
later
life
did
you
know
it
all
and
know
who
the
lady
was
no
guardian
i
returned
fearful
of
the
light
that
dimly
broke
upon
me
nor
do
i
know
yet
lady
dedlock
sister
and
why
i
could
scarcely
ask
him
why
guardian
pray
tell
me
why
were
they
parted
it
was
her
act
and
she
kept
its
motives
in
her
inflexible
heart
he
afterwards
did
conjecture
but
it
was
mere
conjecture
that
some
injury
which
her
haughty
spirit
had
received
in
her
cause
of
quarrel
with
her
sister
had
wounded
her
beyond
all
reason
but
she
wrote
him
that
from
the
date
of
that
letter
she
died
to
him
as
in
literal
truth
she
did
and
that
the
resolution
was
exacted
from
her
by
her
knowledge
of
his
proud
temper
and
his
strained
sense
of
honour
which
were
both
her
nature
too
in
consideration
for
those
master
points
in
him
and
even
in
consideration
for
them
in
herself
she
made
the
sacrifice
she
said
and
would
live
in
it
and
die
in
it
she
did
both
i
fear
certainly
he
never
saw
her
never
heard
of
her
from
that
hour
nor
did
any
one
oh
guardian
what
have
i
done
i
cried
giving
way
to
my
grief
what
sorrow
have
i
innocently
caused
you
caused
esther
yes
guardian
innocently
but
most
surely
that
secluded
sister
is
my
first
remembrance
no
no
he
cried
starting
yes
guardian
yes
and
her
sister
is
my
mother
i
would
have
told
him
all
my
mother
letter
but
he
would
not
hear
it
then
he
spoke
so
tenderly
and
wisely
to
me
and
he
put
so
plainly
before
me
all
i
had
myself
imperfectly
thought
and
hoped
in
my
better
state
of
mind
that
penetrated
as
i
had
been
with
fervent
gratitude
towards
him
through
so
many
years
i
believed
i
had
never
loved
him
so
dearly
never
thanked
him
in
my
heart
so
fully
as
i
did
that
night
and
when
he
had
taken
me
to
my
room
and
kissed
me
at
the
door
and
when
at
last
i
lay
down
to
sleep
my
thought
was
how
could
i
ever
be
busy
enough
how
could
i
ever
be
good
enough
how
in
my
little
way
could
i
ever
hope
to
be
forgetful
enough
of
myself
devoted
enough
to
him
and
useful
enough
to
others
to
show
him
how
i
blessed
and
honoured
him
chapter
xliv
the
letter
and
the
answer
my
guardian
called
me
into
his
room
next
morning
and
then
i
told
him
what
had
been
left
untold
on
the
previous
night
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
he
said
but
to
keep
the
secret
and
to
avoid
another
such
encounter
as
that
of
yesterday
he
understood
my
feeling
and
entirely
shared
it
he
charged
himself
even
with
restraining
skimpole
from
improving
his
opportunity
one
person
whom
he
need
not
name
to
me
it
was
not
now
possible
for
him
to
advise
or
help
he
wished
it
were
but
no
such
thing
could
be
if
her
mistrust
of
the
lawyer
whom
she
had
mentioned
were
which
he
scarcely
doubted
he
dreaded
discovery
he
knew
something
of
him
both
by
sight
and
by
reputation
and
it
was
certain
that
he
was
a
dangerous
man
whatever
happened
he
repeatedly
impressed
upon
me
with
anxious
affection
and
kindness
i
was
as
innocent
of
as
himself
and
as
unable
to
influence
nor
do
i
understand
said
he
that
any
doubts
tend
towards
you
my
dear
much
suspicion
may
exist
without
that
connexion
with
the
lawyer
i
returned
but
two
other
persons
have
come
into
my
mind
since
i
have
been
anxious
then
i
told
him
all
about
guppy
who
i
feared
might
have
had
his
vague
surmises
when
i
little
understood
his
meaning
but
in
whose
silence
after
our
last
interview
i
expressed
perfect
confidence
well
said
my
guardian
then
we
may
dismiss
him
for
the
present
who
is
the
other
i
called
to
his
recollection
the
french
maid
and
the
eager
offer
of
herself
she
had
made
to
me
ha
he
returned
thoughtfully
that
is
a
more
alarming
person
than
the
clerk
but
after
all
my
dear
it
was
but
seeking
for
a
new
service
she
had
seen
you
and
ada
a
little
while
before
and
it
was
natural
that
you
should
come
into
her
head
she
merely
proposed
herself
for
your
maid
you
know
she
did
nothing
more
her
manner
was
strange
said
i
yes
and
her
manner
was
strange
when
she
took
her
shoes
off
and
showed
that
cool
relish
for
a
walk
that
might
have
ended
in
her
said
my
guardian
it
would
be
useless
and
torment
to
reckon
up
such
chances
and
possibilities
there
are
very
few
harmless
circumstances
that
would
not
seem
full
of
perilous
meaning
so
considered
be
hopeful
little
woman
you
can
be
nothing
better
than
yourself
be
that
through
this
knowledge
as
you
were
before
you
had
it
it
is
the
best
you
can
do
for
everybody
sake
i
sharing
the
secret
with
you
and
lightening
it
guardian
so
much
said
will
be
attentive
to
what
passes
in
that
family
so
far
as
i
can
observe
it
from
my
distance
and
if
the
time
should
come
when
i
can
stretch
out
a
hand
to
render
the
least
service
to
one
whom
it
is
better
not
to
name
even
here
i
will
not
fail
to
do
it
for
her
dear
daughter
sake
i
thanked
him
with
my
whole
heart
what
could
i
ever
do
but
thank
him
i
was
going
out
at
the
door
when
he
asked
me
to
stay
a
moment
quickly
turning
round
i
saw
that
same
expression
on
his
face
again
and
all
at
once
i
do
know
how
it
flashed
upon
me
as
a
new
and
possibility
that
i
understood
it
my
dear
esther
said
my
guardian
i
have
long
had
something
in
my
thoughts
that
i
have
wished
to
say
to
you
indeed
i
have
had
some
difficulty
in
approaching
it
and
i
still
have
i
should
wish
it
to
be
so
deliberately
said
and
so
deliberately
considered
would
you
object
to
my
writing
it
dear
guardian
how
could
i
object
to
your
writing
anything
for
me
to
read
then
see
my
love
said
he
with
his
cheery
smile
am
i
at
this
moment
quite
as
plain
and
easy
do
i
seem
as
open
as
honest
and
as
i
am
at
any
time
i
answered
in
all
earnestness
quite
with
the
strictest
truth
for
his
momentary
hesitation
was
gone
it
had
not
lasted
a
minute
and
his
fine
sensible
cordial
sterling
manner
was
restored
do
i
look
as
if
i
suppressed
anything
meant
anything
but
what
i
said
had
any
reservation
at
all
no
matter
what
said
he
with
his
bright
clear
eyes
on
mine
i
answered
most
assuredly
he
did
not
can
you
fully
trust
me
and
thoroughly
rely
on
what
i
profess
esther
most
thoroughly
said
i
with
my
whole
heart
my
dear
girl
returned
my
guardian
give
me
your
hand
he
took
it
in
his
holding
me
lightly
with
his
arm
and
looking
down
into
my
face
with
the
same
genuine
freshness
and
faithfulness
of
manner
the
old
protecting
manner
which
had
made
that
house
my
home
in
a
moment
said
you
have
wrought
changes
in
me
little
woman
since
the
winter
day
in
the
first
and
last
you
have
done
me
a
world
of
good
since
that
time
ah
guardian
what
have
you
done
for
me
since
that
time
but
said
he
that
is
not
to
be
remembered
now
it
never
can
be
forgotten
yes
esther
said
he
with
a
gentle
seriousness
it
is
to
be
forgotten
now
to
be
forgotten
for
a
while
you
are
only
to
remember
now
that
nothing
can
change
me
as
you
know
me
can
you
feel
quite
assured
of
that
my
dear
i
can
and
i
do
i
said
that
much
he
answered
that
everything
but
i
must
not
take
that
at
a
word
i
will
not
write
this
something
in
my
thoughts
until
you
have
quite
resolved
within
yourself
that
nothing
can
change
me
as
you
know
me
if
you
doubt
that
in
the
least
degree
i
will
never
write
it
if
you
are
sure
of
that
on
good
consideration
send
charley
to
me
this
night
week
the
letter
but
if
you
are
not
quite
certain
never
send
mind
i
trust
to
your
truth
in
this
thing
as
in
everything
if
you
are
not
quite
certain
on
that
one
point
never
send
guardian
said
i
i
am
already
certain
i
can
no
more
be
changed
in
that
conviction
than
you
can
be
changed
towards
me
i
shall
send
charley
for
the
letter
he
shook
my
hand
and
said
no
more
nor
was
any
more
said
in
reference
to
this
conversation
either
by
him
or
me
through
the
whole
week
when
the
appointed
night
came
i
said
to
charley
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
go
and
knock
at
jarndyce
door
charley
and
say
you
have
come
from
me
the
letter
charley
went
up
the
stairs
and
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
passages
the
way
about
the
house
seemed
very
long
in
my
listening
ears
that
night
and
so
came
back
along
the
passages
and
down
the
stairs
and
up
the
stairs
and
brought
the
letter
lay
it
on
the
table
charley
said
i
so
charley
laid
it
on
the
table
and
went
to
bed
and
i
sat
looking
at
it
without
taking
it
up
thinking
of
many
things
i
began
with
my
overshadowed
childhood
and
passed
through
those
timid
days
to
the
heavy
time
when
my
aunt
lay
dead
with
her
resolute
face
so
cold
and
set
and
when
i
was
more
solitary
with
rachael
than
if
i
had
had
no
one
in
the
world
to
speak
to
or
to
look
at
i
passed
to
the
altered
days
when
i
was
so
blest
as
to
find
friends
in
all
around
me
and
to
be
beloved
i
came
to
the
time
when
i
first
saw
my
dear
girl
and
was
received
into
that
sisterly
affection
which
was
the
grace
and
beauty
of
my
life
i
recalled
the
first
bright
gleam
of
welcome
which
had
shone
out
of
those
very
windows
upon
our
expectant
faces
on
that
cold
bright
night
and
which
had
never
paled
i
lived
my
happy
life
there
over
again
i
went
through
my
illness
and
recovery
i
thought
of
myself
so
altered
and
of
those
around
me
so
unchanged
and
all
this
happiness
shone
like
a
light
from
one
central
figure
represented
before
me
by
the
letter
on
the
table
i
opened
it
and
read
it
it
was
so
impressive
in
its
love
for
me
and
in
the
unselfish
caution
it
gave
me
and
the
consideration
it
showed
for
me
in
every
word
that
my
eyes
were
too
often
blinded
to
read
much
at
a
time
but
i
read
it
through
three
times
before
i
laid
it
down
i
had
thought
beforehand
that
i
knew
its
purport
and
i
did
it
asked
me
would
i
be
the
mistress
of
bleak
house
it
was
not
a
love
letter
though
it
expressed
so
much
love
but
was
written
just
as
he
would
at
any
time
have
spoken
to
me
i
saw
his
face
and
heard
his
voice
and
felt
the
influence
of
his
kind
protecting
manner
in
every
line
it
addressed
me
as
if
our
places
were
reversed
as
if
all
the
good
deeds
had
been
mine
and
all
the
feelings
they
had
awakened
his
it
dwelt
on
my
being
young
and
he
past
the
prime
of
life
on
his
having
attained
a
ripe
age
while
i
was
a
child
on
his
writing
to
me
with
a
silvered
head
and
knowing
all
this
so
well
as
to
set
it
in
full
before
me
for
mature
deliberation
it
told
me
that
i
would
gain
nothing
by
such
a
marriage
and
lose
nothing
by
rejecting
it
for
no
new
relation
could
enhance
the
tenderness
in
which
he
held
me
and
whatever
my
decision
was
he
was
certain
it
would
be
right
but
he
had
considered
this
step
anew
since
our
late
confidence
and
had
decided
on
taking
it
if
it
only
served
to
show
me
through
one
poor
instance
that
the
whole
world
would
readily
unite
to
falsify
the
stern
prediction
of
my
childhood
i
was
the
last
to
know
what
happiness
i
could
bestow
upon
him
but
of
that
he
said
no
more
for
i
was
always
to
remember
that
i
owed
him
nothing
and
that
he
was
my
debtor
and
for
very
much
he
had
often
thought
of
our
future
and
foreseeing
that
the
time
must
come
and
fearing
that
it
might
come
soon
when
ada
now
very
nearly
of
age
would
leave
us
and
when
our
present
mode
of
life
must
be
broken
up
had
become
accustomed
to
reflect
on
this
proposal
thus
he
made
it
if
i
felt
that
i
could
ever
give
him
the
best
right
he
could
have
to
be
my
protector
and
if
i
felt
that
i
could
happily
and
justly
become
the
dear
companion
of
his
remaining
life
superior
to
all
lighter
chances
and
changes
than
death
even
then
he
could
not
have
me
bind
myself
irrevocably
while
this
letter
was
yet
so
new
to
me
but
even
then
i
must
have
ample
time
for
reconsideration
in
that
case
or
in
the
opposite
case
let
him
be
unchanged
in
his
old
relation
in
his
old
manner
in
the
old
name
by
which
i
called
him
and
as
to
his
bright
dame
durden
and
little
housekeeper
she
would
ever
be
the
same
he
knew
this
was
the
substance
of
the
letter
written
throughout
with
a
justice
and
a
dignity
as
if
he
were
indeed
my
responsible
guardian
impartially
representing
the
proposal
of
a
friend
against
whom
in
his
integrity
he
stated
the
full
case
but
he
did
not
hint
to
me
that
when
i
had
been
better
looking
he
had
had
this
same
proceeding
in
his
thoughts
and
had
refrained
from
it
that
when
my
old
face
was
gone
from
me
and
i
had
no
attractions
he
could
love
me
just
as
well
as
in
my
fairer
days
that
the
discovery
of
my
birth
gave
him
no
shock
that
his
generosity
rose
above
my
disfigurement
and
my
inheritance
of
shame
that
the
more
i
stood
in
need
of
such
fidelity
the
more
firmly
i
might
trust
in
him
to
the
last
but
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
well
now
it
came
upon
me
as
the
close
of
the
benignant
history
i
had
been
pursuing
and
i
felt
that
i
had
but
one
thing
to
do
to
devote
my
life
to
his
happiness
was
to
thank
him
poorly
and
what
had
i
wished
for
the
other
night
but
some
new
means
of
thanking
him
still
i
cried
very
much
not
only
in
the
fullness
of
my
heart
after
reading
the
letter
not
only
in
the
strangeness
of
the
prospect
for
it
was
strange
though
i
had
expected
the
contents
but
as
if
something
for
which
there
was
no
name
or
distinct
idea
were
indefinitely
lost
to
me
i
was
very
happy
very
thankful
very
hopeful
but
i
cried
very
much
by
and
by
i
went
to
my
old
glass
my
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
and
i
said
oh
esther
esther
can
that
be
you
i
am
afraid
the
face
in
the
glass
was
going
to
cry
again
at
this
reproach
but
i
held
up
my
finger
at
it
and
it
stopped
that
is
more
like
the
composed
look
you
comforted
me
with
my
dear
when
you
showed
me
such
a
change
said
i
beginning
to
let
down
my
hair
when
you
are
mistress
of
bleak
house
you
are
to
be
as
cheerful
as
a
bird
in
fact
you
are
always
to
be
cheerful
so
let
us
begin
for
once
and
for
all
i
went
on
with
my
hair
now
quite
comfortably
i
sobbed
a
little
still
but
that
was
because
i
had
been
crying
not
because
i
was
crying
then
and
so
esther
my
dear
you
are
happy
for
life
happy
with
your
best
friends
happy
in
your
old
home
happy
in
the
power
of
doing
a
great
deal
of
good
and
happy
in
the
undeserved
love
of
the
best
of
men
i
thought
all
at
once
if
my
guardian
had
married
some
one
else
how
should
i
have
felt
and
what
should
i
have
done
that
would
have
been
a
change
indeed
it
presented
my
life
in
such
a
new
and
blank
form
that
i
rang
my
housekeeping
keys
and
gave
them
a
kiss
before
i
laid
them
down
in
their
basket
again
then
i
went
on
to
think
as
i
dressed
my
hair
before
the
glass
how
often
had
i
considered
within
myself
that
the
deep
traces
of
my
illness
and
the
circumstances
of
my
birth
were
only
new
reasons
why
i
should
be
busy
busy
busy
useful
amiable
serviceable
in
all
honest
unpretending
ways
this
was
a
good
time
to
be
sure
to
sit
down
morbidly
and
cry
as
to
its
seeming
at
all
strange
to
me
at
first
if
that
were
any
excuse
for
crying
which
it
was
not
that
i
was
one
day
to
be
the
mistress
of
bleak
house
why
should
it
seem
strange
other
people
had
thought
of
such
things
if
i
had
not
do
you
remember
my
plain
dear
i
asked
myself
looking
at
the
glass
what
woodcourt
said
before
those
scars
were
there
about
your
marrying
perhaps
the
name
brought
them
to
my
remembrance
the
dried
remains
of
the
flowers
it
would
be
better
not
to
keep
them
now
they
had
only
been
preserved
in
memory
of
something
wholly
past
and
gone
but
it
would
be
better
not
to
keep
them
now
they
were
in
a
book
and
it
happened
to
be
in
the
next
room
our
dividing
ada
chamber
from
mine
i
took
a
candle
and
went
softly
in
to
fetch
it
from
its
shelf
after
i
had
it
in
my
hand
i
saw
my
beautiful
darling
through
the
open
door
lying
asleep
and
i
stole
in
to
kiss
her
it
was
weak
in
me
i
know
and
i
could
have
no
reason
for
crying
but
i
dropped
a
tear
upon
her
dear
face
and
another
and
another
weaker
than
that
i
took
the
withered
flowers
out
and
put
them
for
a
moment
to
her
lips
i
thought
about
her
love
for
richard
though
indeed
the
flowers
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
then
i
took
them
into
my
own
room
and
burned
them
at
the
candle
and
they
were
dust
in
an
instant
on
entering
the
next
morning
i
found
my
guardian
just
as
usual
quite
as
frank
as
open
and
free
there
being
not
the
least
constraint
in
his
manner
there
was
none
or
i
think
there
was
none
in
mine
i
was
with
him
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
in
and
out
when
there
was
no
one
there
and
i
thought
it
not
unlikely
that
he
might
speak
to
me
about
the
letter
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
so
on
the
next
morning
and
the
next
and
for
at
least
a
week
over
which
time
skimpole
prolonged
his
stay
i
expected
every
day
that
my
guardian
might
speak
to
me
about
the
letter
but
he
never
did
i
thought
then
growing
uneasy
that
i
ought
to
write
an
answer
i
tried
over
and
over
again
in
my
own
room
at
night
but
i
could
not
write
an
answer
that
at
all
began
like
a
good
answer
so
i
thought
each
night
i
would
wait
one
more
day
and
i
waited
seven
more
days
and
he
never
said
a
word
at
last
skimpole
having
departed
we
three
were
one
afternoon
going
out
for
a
ride
and
i
being
dressed
before
ada
and
going
down
came
upon
my
guardian
with
his
back
towards
me
standing
at
the
window
looking
out
he
turned
on
my
coming
in
and
said
smiling
aye
it
you
little
woman
is
it
and
looked
out
again
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
him
now
in
short
i
had
come
down
on
purpose
guardian
i
said
rather
hesitating
and
trembling
when
would
you
like
to
have
the
answer
to
the
letter
charley
came
for
when
it
ready
my
dear
he
replied
i
think
it
is
ready
said
i
is
charley
to
bring
it
he
asked
pleasantly
no
i
have
brought
it
myself
guardian
i
returned
i
put
my
two
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
he
said
was
this
the
mistress
of
bleak
house
and
i
said
yes
and
it
made
no
difference
presently
and
we
all
went
out
together
and
i
said
nothing
to
my
precious
pet
about
it
chapter
xlv
in
trust
one
morning
when
i
had
done
jingling
about
with
my
baskets
of
keys
as
my
beauty
and
i
were
walking
round
and
round
the
garden
i
happened
to
turn
my
eyes
towards
the
house
and
saw
a
long
thin
shadow
going
in
which
looked
like
vholes
ada
had
been
telling
me
only
that
morning
of
her
hopes
that
richard
might
exhaust
his
ardour
in
the
chancery
suit
by
being
so
very
earnest
in
it
and
therefore
not
to
damp
my
dear
girl
spirits
i
said
nothing
about
shadow
presently
came
charley
lightly
winding
among
the
bushes
and
tripping
along
the
paths
as
rosy
and
pretty
as
one
of
flora
attendants
instead
of
my
maid
saying
oh
if
you
please
miss
would
you
step
and
speak
to
mr
jarndyce
it
was
one
of
charley
peculiarities
that
whenever
she
was
charged
with
a
message
she
always
began
to
deliver
it
as
soon
as
she
beheld
at
any
distance
the
person
for
whom
it
was
intended
therefore
i
saw
charley
asking
me
in
her
usual
form
of
words
to
step
and
speak
to
jarndyce
long
before
i
heard
her
and
when
i
did
hear
her
she
had
said
it
so
often
that
she
was
out
of
breath
i
told
ada
i
would
make
haste
back
and
inquired
of
charley
as
we
went
in
whether
there
was
not
a
gentleman
with
jarndyce
to
which
charley
whose
grammar
i
confess
to
my
shame
never
did
any
credit
to
my
educational
powers
replied
yes
miss
him
as
come
down
in
the
country
with
mr
richard
a
more
complete
contrast
than
my
guardian
and
vholes
i
suppose
there
could
not
be
i
found
them
looking
at
one
another
across
a
table
the
one
so
open
and
the
other
so
close
the
one
so
broad
and
upright
and
the
other
so
narrow
and
stooping
the
one
giving
out
what
he
had
to
say
in
such
a
rich
ringing
voice
and
the
other
keeping
it
in
in
such
a
gasping
manner
that
i
thought
i
never
had
seen
two
people
so
unmatched
you
know
vholes
my
dear
said
my
guardian
not
with
the
greatest
urbanity
i
must
say
vholes
rose
gloved
and
buttoned
up
as
usual
and
seated
himself
again
just
as
he
had
seated
himself
beside
richard
in
the
gig
not
having
richard
to
look
at
he
looked
straight
before
him
vholes
said
my
guardian
eyeing
his
black
figure
as
if
he
were
a
bird
of
ill
omen
has
brought
an
ugly
report
of
our
most
unfortunate
rick
laying
a
marked
emphasis
on
most
unfortunate
as
if
the
words
were
rather
descriptive
of
his
connexion
with
vholes
i
sat
down
between
them
vholes
remained
immovable
except
that
he
secretly
picked
at
one
of
the
red
pimples
on
his
yellow
face
with
his
black
glove
and
as
rick
and
you
are
happily
good
friends
i
should
like
to
know
said
my
guardian
what
you
think
my
dear
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
as
to
speak
up
mr
vholes
doing
anything
but
that
vholes
observed
i
have
been
saying
that
i
have
reason
to
know
miss
summerson
as
professional
adviser
that
circumstances
are
at
the
present
moment
in
an
embarrassed
state
not
so
much
in
point
of
amount
as
owing
to
the
peculiar
and
pressing
nature
of
liabilities
has
incurred
and
the
means
he
has
of
liquidating
or
meeting
the
same
i
have
staved
off
many
little
matters
for
but
there
is
a
limit
to
staving
off
and
we
have
reached
it
i
have
made
some
advances
out
of
pocket
to
accommodate
these
unpleasantnesses
but
i
necessarily
look
to
being
repaid
for
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
man
of
capital
and
i
have
a
father
to
support
in
the
vale
of
taunton
besides
striving
to
realize
some
little
independence
for
three
dear
girls
at
home
my
apprehension
is
circumstances
being
such
lest
it
should
end
in
his
obtaining
leave
to
part
with
his
commission
which
at
all
events
is
desirable
to
be
made
known
to
his
connexions
vholes
who
had
looked
at
me
while
speaking
here
emerged
into
the
silence
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
broken
so
stifled
was
his
tone
and
looked
before
him
again
imagine
the
poor
fellow
without
even
his
present
resource
said
my
guardian
to
me
yet
what
can
i
do
you
know
him
esther
he
would
never
accept
of
help
from
me
now
to
offer
it
or
hint
at
it
would
be
to
drive
him
to
an
extremity
if
nothing
else
did
vholes
hereupon
addressed
me
again
what
jarndyce
remarks
miss
is
no
doubt
the
case
and
is
the
difficulty
i
do
not
see
that
anything
is
to
be
done
i
do
not
say
that
anything
is
to
be
done
far
from
it
i
merely
come
down
here
under
the
seal
of
confidence
and
mention
it
in
order
that
everything
may
be
openly
carried
on
and
that
it
may
not
be
said
afterwards
that
everything
was
not
openly
carried
on
my
wish
is
that
everything
should
be
openly
carried
on
i
desire
to
leave
a
good
name
behind
me
if
i
consulted
merely
my
own
interests
with
i
should
not
be
here
so
insurmountable
as
you
must
well
know
would
be
his
objections
this
is
not
a
professional
attendance
this
can
he
charged
to
nobody
i
have
no
interest
in
it
except
as
a
member
of
society
and
a
father
and
a
son
said
vholes
who
had
nearly
forgotten
that
point
it
appeared
to
us
that
vholes
said
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
truth
in
intimating
that
he
sought
to
divide
the
responsibility
such
as
it
was
of
knowing
richard
situation
i
could
only
suggest
that
i
should
go
down
to
deal
where
richard
was
then
stationed
and
see
him
and
try
if
it
were
possible
to
avert
the
worst
without
consulting
vholes
on
this
point
i
took
my
guardian
aside
to
propose
it
while
vholes
gauntly
stalked
to
the
fire
and
warmed
his
funeral
gloves
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
formed
an
immediate
objection
on
my
guardian
part
but
as
i
saw
he
had
no
other
and
as
i
was
only
too
happy
to
go
i
got
his
consent
we
had
then
merely
to
dispose
of
vholes
well
sir
said
jarndyce
miss
summerson
will
communicate
with
carstone
and
you
can
only
hope
that
his
position
may
be
yet
retrievable
you
will
allow
me
to
order
you
lunch
after
your
journey
sir
i
thank
you
jarndyce
said
vholes
putting
out
his
long
black
sleeve
to
check
the
ringing
of
the
bell
not
any
i
thank
you
no
not
a
morsel
my
digestion
is
much
impaired
and
i
am
but
a
poor
knife
and
fork
at
any
time
if
i
was
to
partake
of
solid
food
at
this
period
of
the
day
i
do
know
what
the
consequences
might
be
everything
having
been
openly
carried
on
sir
i
will
now
with
your
permission
take
my
leave
and
i
would
that
you
could
take
your
leave
and
we
could
all
take
our
leave
vholes
returned
my
guardian
bitterly
of
a
cause
you
know
of
vholes
whose
black
dye
was
so
deep
from
head
to
foot
that
it
had
quite
steamed
before
the
fire
diffusing
a
very
unpleasant
perfume
made
a
short
inclination
of
his
head
from
the
neck
and
slowly
shook
it
we
whose
ambition
it
is
to
be
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
respectable
practitioners
sir
can
but
put
our
shoulders
to
the
wheel
we
do
it
sir
at
least
i
do
it
myself
and
i
wish
to
think
well
of
my
professional
brethren
one
and
all
you
are
sensible
of
an
obligation
not
to
refer
to
me
miss
in
communicating
with
mr
i
said
i
would
be
careful
not
to
do
it
just
so
miss
good
morning
jarndyce
good
morning
sir
vholes
put
his
dead
glove
which
scarcely
seemed
to
have
any
hand
in
it
on
my
fingers
and
then
on
my
guardian
fingers
and
took
his
long
thin
shadow
away
i
thought
of
it
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
passing
over
all
the
sunny
landscape
between
us
and
london
chilling
the
seed
in
the
ground
as
it
glided
along
of
course
it
became
necessary
to
tell
ada
where
i
was
going
and
why
i
was
going
and
of
course
she
was
anxious
and
distressed
but
she
was
too
true
to
richard
to
say
anything
but
words
of
pity
and
words
of
excuse
and
in
a
more
loving
spirit
still
my
dear
devoted
girl
she
wrote
him
a
long
letter
of
which
i
took
charge
charley
was
to
be
my
travelling
companion
though
i
am
sure
i
wanted
none
and
would
willingly
have
left
her
at
home
we
all
went
to
london
that
afternoon
and
finding
two
places
in
the
mail
secured
them
at
our
usual
charley
and
i
were
rolling
away
seaward
with
the
kentish
letters
it
was
a
night
journey
in
those
coach
times
but
we
had
the
mail
to
ourselves
and
did
not
find
the
night
very
tedious
it
passed
with
me
as
i
suppose
it
would
with
most
people
under
such
circumstances
at
one
while
my
journey
looked
hopeful
and
at
another
hopeless
now
i
thought
i
should
do
some
good
and
now
i
wondered
how
i
could
ever
have
supposed
so
now
it
seemed
one
of
the
most
reasonable
things
in
the
world
that
i
should
have
come
and
now
one
of
the
most
unreasonable
in
what
state
i
should
find
richard
what
i
should
say
to
him
and
what
he
would
say
to
me
occupied
my
mind
by
turns
with
these
two
states
of
feeling
and
the
wheels
seemed
to
play
one
tune
to
which
the
burden
of
my
guardian
letter
set
itself
over
and
over
again
all
night
at
last
we
came
into
the
narrow
streets
of
deal
and
very
gloomy
they
were
upon
a
raw
misty
morning
the
long
flat
beach
with
its
little
irregular
houses
wooden
and
brick
and
its
litter
of
capstans
and
great
boats
and
sheds
and
bare
upright
poles
with
tackle
and
blocks
and
loose
gravelly
waste
places
overgrown
with
grass
and
weeds
wore
as
dull
an
appearance
as
any
place
i
ever
saw
the
sea
was
heaving
under
a
thick
white
fog
and
nothing
else
was
moving
but
a
few
early
ropemakers
who
with
the
yarn
twisted
round
their
bodies
looked
as
if
tired
of
their
present
state
of
existence
they
were
spinning
themselves
into
cordage
but
when
we
got
into
a
warm
room
in
an
excellent
hotel
and
sat
down
comfortably
washed
and
dressed
to
an
early
breakfast
for
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
going
to
bed
deal
began
to
look
more
cheerful
our
little
room
was
like
a
ship
cabin
and
that
delighted
charley
very
much
then
the
fog
began
to
rise
like
a
curtain
and
numbers
of
ships
that
we
had
had
no
idea
were
near
appeared
i
do
know
how
many
sail
the
waiter
told
us
were
then
lying
in
the
downs
some
of
these
vessels
were
of
grand
size
one
was
a
large
indiaman
just
come
home
and
when
the
sun
shone
through
the
clouds
making
silvery
pools
in
the
dark
sea
the
way
in
which
these
ships
brightened
and
shadowed
and
changed
amid
a
bustle
of
boats
pulling
off
from
the
shore
to
them
and
from
them
to
the
shore
and
a
general
life
and
motion
in
themselves
and
everything
around
them
was
most
beautiful
the
large
indiaman
was
our
great
attraction
because
she
had
come
into
the
downs
in
the
night
she
was
surrounded
by
boats
and
we
said
how
glad
the
people
on
board
of
her
must
be
to
come
ashore
charley
was
curious
too
about
the
voyage
and
about
the
heat
in
india
and
the
serpents
and
the
tigers
and
as
she
picked
up
such
information
much
faster
than
grammar
i
told
her
what
i
knew
on
those
points
i
told
her
too
how
people
in
such
voyages
were
sometimes
wrecked
and
cast
on
rocks
where
they
were
saved
by
the
intrepidity
and
humanity
of
one
man
and
charley
asking
how
that
could
be
i
told
her
how
we
knew
at
home
of
such
a
case
i
had
thought
of
sending
richard
a
note
saying
i
was
there
but
it
seemed
so
much
better
to
go
to
him
without
preparation
as
he
lived
in
barracks
i
was
a
little
doubtful
whether
this
was
feasible
but
we
went
out
to
reconnoitre
peeping
in
at
the
gate
of
the
we
found
everything
very
quiet
at
that
time
in
the
morning
and
i
asked
a
sergeant
standing
on
the
where
he
lived
he
sent
a
man
before
to
show
me
who
went
up
some
bare
stairs
and
knocked
with
his
knuckles
at
a
door
and
left
us
now
then
cried
richard
from
within
so
i
left
charley
in
the
little
passage
and
going
on
to
the
door
said
can
i
come
in
richard
it
only
dame
durden
he
was
writing
at
a
table
with
a
great
confusion
of
clothes
tin
cases
books
boots
brushes
and
portmanteaus
strewn
all
about
the
floor
he
was
only
half
dressed
in
plain
clothes
i
observed
not
in
uniform
and
his
hair
was
unbrushed
and
he
looked
as
wild
as
his
room
all
this
i
saw
after
he
had
heartily
welcomed
me
and
i
was
seated
near
him
for
he
started
upon
hearing
my
voice
and
caught
me
in
his
arms
in
a
moment
dear
richard
he
was
ever
the
same
to
me
down
to
ah
poor
poor
fellow
to
the
end
he
never
received
me
but
with
something
of
his
old
merry
boyish
manner
good
heaven
my
dear
little
woman
said
he
how
do
you
come
here
who
could
have
thought
of
seeing
you
nothing
the
matter
ada
is
well
quite
well
lovelier
than
ever
richard
ah
he
said
leaning
back
in
his
chair
my
poor
cousin
i
was
writing
to
you
esther
so
worn
and
haggard
as
he
looked
even
in
the
fullness
of
his
handsome
youth
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
crushing
the
closely
written
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
have
you
been
at
the
trouble
of
writing
all
that
and
am
i
not
to
read
it
after
all
i
asked
oh
my
dear
he
returned
with
a
hopeless
gesture
you
may
read
it
in
the
whole
room
it
is
all
over
here
i
mildly
entreated
him
not
to
be
despondent
i
told
him
that
i
had
heard
by
chance
of
his
being
in
difficulty
and
had
come
to
consult
with
him
what
could
best
be
done
like
you
esther
but
useless
and
so
not
like
you
said
he
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
am
away
on
leave
this
day
should
have
been
gone
in
another
hour
and
that
is
to
smooth
it
over
for
my
selling
out
well
let
bygones
be
bygones
so
this
calling
follows
the
rest
i
only
want
to
have
been
in
the
church
to
have
made
the
round
of
all
the
professions
richard
i
urged
it
is
not
so
hopeless
as
that
esther
he
returned
it
is
indeed
i
am
just
so
near
disgrace
as
that
those
who
are
put
in
authority
over
me
as
the
catechism
goes
would
far
rather
be
without
me
than
with
me
and
they
are
right
apart
from
debts
and
duns
and
all
such
drawbacks
i
am
not
fit
even
for
this
employment
i
have
no
care
no
mind
no
heart
no
soul
but
for
one
thing
why
if
this
bubble
had
broken
now
he
said
tearing
the
letter
he
had
written
into
fragments
and
moodily
casting
them
away
by
driblets
how
could
i
have
gone
abroad
i
must
have
been
ordered
abroad
but
how
could
i
have
gone
how
could
i
with
my
experience
of
that
thing
trust
even
vholes
unless
i
was
at
his
back
i
suppose
he
knew
by
my
face
what
i
was
about
to
say
but
he
caught
the
hand
i
had
laid
upon
his
arm
and
touched
my
own
lips
with
it
to
prevent
me
from
going
on
no
dame
durden
two
subjects
i
forbid
must
forbid
the
first
is
john
jarndyce
the
second
you
know
what
call
it
madness
and
i
tell
you
i
ca
help
it
now
and
ca
be
sane
but
it
is
no
such
thing
it
is
the
one
object
i
have
to
pursue
it
is
a
pity
i
ever
was
prevailed
upon
to
turn
out
of
my
road
for
any
other
it
would
be
wisdom
to
abandon
it
now
after
all
the
time
anxiety
and
pains
i
have
bestowed
upon
it
oh
yes
true
wisdom
it
would
be
very
agreeable
too
to
some
people
but
i
never
will
he
was
in
that
mood
in
which
i
thought
it
best
not
to
increase
his
determination
if
anything
could
increase
it
by
opposing
him
i
took
out
ada
letter
and
put
it
in
his
hand
am
i
to
read
it
now
he
asked
as
i
told
him
yes
he
laid
it
on
the
table
and
resting
his
head
upon
his
hand
began
he
had
not
read
far
when
he
rested
his
head
upon
his
two
hands
to
hide
his
face
from
me
in
a
little
while
he
rose
as
if
the
light
were
bad
and
went
to
the
window
he
finished
reading
it
there
with
his
back
towards
me
and
after
he
had
finished
and
had
folded
it
up
stood
there
for
some
minutes
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
when
he
came
back
to
his
chair
i
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
of
course
esther
you
know
what
she
says
here
he
spoke
in
a
softened
voice
and
kissed
the
letter
as
he
asked
me
yes
richard
offers
me
he
went
on
tapping
his
foot
upon
the
floor
the
little
inheritance
she
is
certain
of
so
soon
just
as
little
and
as
much
as
i
have
wasted
and
begs
and
prays
me
to
take
it
set
myself
right
with
it
and
remain
in
the
service
i
know
your
welfare
to
be
the
dearest
wish
of
her
heart
said
i
and
oh
my
dear
richard
ada
is
a
noble
heart
i
am
sure
it
is
i
i
wish
i
was
dead
he
went
back
to
the
window
and
laying
his
arm
across
it
leaned
his
head
down
on
his
arm
it
greatly
affected
me
to
see
him
so
but
i
hoped
he
might
become
more
yielding
and
i
remained
silent
my
experience
was
very
limited
i
was
not
at
all
prepared
for
his
rousing
himself
out
of
this
emotion
to
a
new
sense
of
injury
and
this
is
the
heart
that
the
same
john
jarndyce
who
is
not
otherwise
to
be
mentioned
between
us
stepped
in
to
estrange
from
me
said
he
indignantly
and
the
dear
girl
makes
me
this
generous
offer
from
under
the
same
john
jarndyce
roof
and
with
the
same
john
jarndyce
gracious
consent
and
connivance
i
dare
say
as
a
new
means
of
buying
me
off
richard
i
cried
out
rising
hastily
i
will
not
hear
you
say
such
shameful
words
i
was
very
angry
with
him
indeed
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
but
it
only
lasted
a
moment
when
i
saw
his
worn
young
face
looking
at
me
as
if
he
were
sorry
i
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
if
you
please
my
dear
richard
do
not
speak
in
such
a
tone
to
me
consider
he
blamed
himself
exceedingly
and
told
me
in
the
most
generous
manner
that
he
had
been
very
wrong
and
that
he
begged
my
pardon
a
thousand
times
at
that
i
laughed
but
trembled
a
little
too
for
i
was
rather
fluttered
after
being
so
fiery
to
accept
this
offer
my
dear
esther
said
he
sitting
down
beside
me
and
resuming
our
conversation
once
more
pray
pray
forgive
me
i
am
deeply
grieved
to
accept
my
dearest
cousin
offer
is
i
need
not
say
impossible
besides
i
have
letters
and
papers
that
i
could
show
you
which
would
convince
you
it
is
all
over
here
i
have
done
with
the
red
coat
believe
me
but
it
is
some
satisfaction
in
the
midst
of
my
troubles
and
perplexities
to
know
that
i
am
pressing
ada
interests
in
pressing
my
own
vholes
has
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
he
can
not
help
urging
it
on
as
much
for
her
as
for
me
thank
god
his
sanguine
hopes
were
rising
within
him
and
lighting
up
his
features
but
they
made
his
face
more
sad
to
me
than
it
had
been
before
no
no
cried
richard
exultingly
if
every
farthing
of
little
fortune
were
mine
no
part
of
it
should
be
spent
in
retaining
me
in
what
i
am
not
fit
for
can
take
no
interest
in
and
am
weary
of
it
should
be
devoted
to
what
promises
a
better
return
and
should
be
used
where
she
has
a
larger
stake
do
be
uneasy
for
me
i
shall
now
have
only
one
thing
on
my
mind
and
vholes
and
i
will
work
it
i
shall
not
be
without
means
free
of
my
commission
i
shall
be
able
to
compound
with
some
small
usurers
who
will
hear
of
nothing
but
their
bond
now
vholes
says
so
i
should
have
a
balance
in
my
favour
anyway
but
that
would
swell
it
come
come
you
shall
carry
a
letter
to
ada
from
me
esther
and
you
must
both
of
you
be
more
hopeful
of
me
and
not
believe
that
i
am
quite
cast
away
just
yet
my
dear
i
will
not
repeat
what
i
said
to
richard
i
know
it
was
tiresome
and
nobody
is
to
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
was
at
all
wise
it
only
came
from
my
heart
he
heard
it
patiently
and
feelingly
but
i
saw
that
on
the
two
subjects
he
had
reserved
it
was
at
present
hopeless
to
make
any
representation
to
him
i
saw
too
and
had
experienced
in
this
very
interview
the
sense
of
my
guardian
remark
that
it
was
even
more
mischievous
to
use
persuasion
with
him
than
to
leave
him
as
he
was
therefore
i
was
driven
at
last
to
asking
richard
if
he
would
mind
convincing
me
that
it
really
was
all
over
there
as
he
had
said
and
that
it
was
not
his
mere
impression
he
showed
me
without
hesitation
a
correspondence
making
it
quite
plain
that
his
retirement
was
arranged
i
found
from
what
he
told
me
that
vholes
had
copies
of
these
papers
and
had
been
in
consultation
with
him
throughout
beyond
ascertaining
this
and
having
been
the
bearer
of
ada
letter
and
being
as
i
was
going
to
be
richard
companion
back
to
london
i
had
done
no
good
by
coming
down
admitting
this
to
myself
with
a
reluctant
heart
i
said
i
would
return
to
the
hotel
and
wait
until
he
joined
me
there
so
he
threw
a
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
saw
me
to
the
gate
and
charley
and
i
went
back
along
the
beach
there
was
a
concourse
of
people
in
one
spot
surrounding
some
naval
officers
who
were
landing
from
a
boat
and
pressing
about
them
with
unusual
interest
i
said
to
charley
this
would
be
one
of
the
great
indiaman
boats
now
and
we
stopped
to
look
the
gentlemen
came
slowly
up
from
the
waterside
speaking
to
each
other
and
to
the
people
around
and
glancing
about
them
as
if
they
were
glad
to
be
in
england
again
charley
charley
said
i
come
away
and
i
hurried
on
so
swiftly
that
my
little
maid
was
surprised
it
was
not
until
we
were
shut
up
in
our
and
i
had
had
time
to
take
breath
that
i
began
to
think
why
i
had
made
such
haste
in
one
of
the
sunburnt
faces
i
had
recognized
allan
woodcourt
and
i
had
been
afraid
of
his
recognizing
me
i
had
been
unwilling
that
he
should
see
my
altered
looks
i
had
been
taken
by
surprise
and
my
courage
had
quite
failed
me
but
i
knew
this
would
not
do
and
i
now
said
to
myself
my
dear
there
is
no
reason
there
is
and
there
can
be
no
reason
at
all
why
it
should
be
worse
for
you
now
than
it
ever
has
been
what
you
were
last
month
you
are
you
are
no
worse
you
are
no
better
this
is
not
your
resolution
call
it
up
esther
call
it
up
i
was
in
a
great
tremble
with
running
and
at
first
was
quite
unable
to
calm
myself
but
i
got
better
and
i
was
very
glad
to
know
it
the
party
came
to
the
hotel
i
heard
them
speaking
on
the
staircase
i
was
sure
it
was
the
same
gentlemen
because
i
knew
their
voices
again
i
mean
i
knew
woodcourt
it
would
still
have
been
a
great
relief
to
me
to
have
gone
away
without
making
myself
known
but
i
was
determined
not
to
do
so
no
my
dear
no
no
no
no
i
untied
my
bonnet
and
put
my
veil
half
up
i
think
i
mean
half
down
but
it
matters
very
little
and
wrote
on
one
of
my
cards
that
i
happened
to
be
there
with
richard
carstone
and
i
sent
it
in
to
woodcourt
he
came
immediately
i
told
him
i
was
rejoiced
to
be
by
chance
among
the
first
to
welcome
him
home
to
england
and
i
saw
that
he
was
very
sorry
for
me
you
have
been
in
shipwreck
and
peril
since
you
left
us
woodcourt
said
i
but
we
can
hardly
call
that
a
misfortune
which
enabled
you
to
be
so
useful
and
so
brave
we
read
of
it
with
the
truest
interest
it
first
came
to
my
knowledge
through
your
old
patient
poor
miss
flite
when
i
was
recovering
from
my
severe
illness
ah
little
miss
flite
he
said
she
lives
the
same
life
yet
just
the
same
i
was
so
comfortable
with
myself
now
as
not
to
mind
the
veil
and
to
be
able
to
put
it
aside
her
gratitude
to
you
woodcourt
is
delightful
she
is
a
most
affectionate
creature
as
i
have
reason
to
say
you
you
have
found
her
so
he
returned
i
i
am
glad
of
that
he
was
so
very
sorry
for
me
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
i
assure
you
said
i
that
i
was
deeply
touched
by
her
sympathy
and
pleasure
at
the
time
i
have
referred
to
i
was
grieved
to
hear
that
you
had
been
very
i
was
very
but
you
have
quite
recovered
i
have
quite
recovered
my
health
and
my
cheerfulness
said
i
you
know
how
good
my
guardian
is
and
what
a
happy
life
we
lead
and
i
have
everything
to
be
thankful
for
and
nothing
in
the
world
to
desire
i
felt
as
if
he
had
greater
commiseration
for
me
than
i
had
ever
had
for
myself
it
inspired
me
with
new
fortitude
and
new
calmness
to
find
that
it
was
i
who
was
under
the
necessity
of
reassuring
him
i
spoke
to
him
of
his
voyage
out
and
home
and
of
his
future
plans
and
of
his
probable
return
to
india
he
said
that
was
very
doubtful
he
had
not
found
himself
more
favoured
by
fortune
there
than
here
he
had
gone
out
a
poor
ship
surgeon
and
had
come
home
nothing
better
while
we
were
talking
and
when
i
was
glad
to
believe
that
i
had
alleviated
if
i
may
use
such
a
term
the
shock
he
had
had
in
seeing
me
richard
came
in
he
had
heard
downstairs
who
was
with
me
and
they
met
with
cordial
pleasure
i
saw
that
after
their
first
greetings
were
over
and
when
they
spoke
of
richard
career
woodcourt
had
a
perception
that
all
was
not
going
well
with
him
he
frequently
glanced
at
his
face
as
if
there
were
something
in
it
that
gave
him
pain
and
more
than
once
he
looked
towards
me
as
though
he
sought
to
ascertain
whether
i
knew
what
the
truth
was
yet
richard
was
in
one
of
his
sanguine
states
and
in
good
spirits
and
was
thoroughly
pleased
to
see
woodcourt
again
whom
he
had
always
liked
richard
proposed
that
we
all
should
go
to
london
together
but
woodcourt
having
to
remain
by
his
ship
a
little
longer
could
not
join
us
he
dined
with
us
however
at
an
early
hour
and
became
so
much
more
like
what
he
used
to
be
that
i
was
still
more
at
peace
to
think
i
had
been
able
to
soften
his
regrets
yet
his
mind
was
not
relieved
of
richard
when
the
coach
was
almost
ready
and
richard
ran
down
to
look
after
his
luggage
he
spoke
to
me
about
him
i
was
not
sure
that
i
had
a
right
to
lay
his
whole
story
open
but
i
referred
in
a
few
words
to
his
estrangement
from
mr
jarndyce
and
to
his
being
entangled
in
the
chancery
suit
woodcourt
listened
with
interest
and
expressed
his
regret
i
saw
you
observe
him
rather
closely
said
i
do
you
think
him
so
changed
he
is
changed
he
returned
shaking
his
head
i
felt
the
blood
rush
into
my
face
for
the
first
time
but
it
was
only
an
instantaneous
emotion
i
turned
my
head
aside
and
it
was
gone
it
is
not
said
woodcourt
his
being
so
much
younger
or
older
or
thinner
or
fatter
or
paler
or
ruddier
as
there
being
upon
his
face
such
a
singular
expression
i
never
saw
so
remarkable
a
look
in
a
young
person
one
can
not
say
that
it
is
all
anxiety
or
all
weariness
yet
it
is
both
and
like
ungrown
despair
you
do
not
think
he
is
ill
said
i
no
he
looked
robust
in
body
that
he
can
not
be
at
peace
in
mind
we
have
too
much
reason
to
know
i
proceeded
woodcourt
you
are
going
to
london
or
the
next
day
there
is
nothing
richard
wants
so
much
as
a
friend
he
always
liked
you
pray
see
him
when
you
get
there
pray
help
him
sometimes
with
your
companionship
if
you
can
you
do
not
know
of
what
service
it
might
be
you
can
not
think
how
ada
and
jarndyce
and
even
i
how
we
should
all
thank
you
mr
woodcourt
miss
summerson
he
said
more
moved
than
he
had
been
from
the
first
before
heaven
i
will
be
a
true
friend
to
him
i
will
accept
him
as
a
trust
and
it
shall
be
a
sacred
one
god
bless
you
said
i
with
my
eyes
filling
fast
but
i
thought
they
might
when
it
was
not
for
myself
ada
loves
him
we
all
love
him
but
ada
loves
him
as
we
can
not
i
will
tell
her
what
you
say
thank
you
and
god
bless
you
in
her
name
richard
came
back
as
we
finished
exchanging
these
hurried
words
and
gave
me
his
arm
to
take
me
to
the
coach
woodcourt
he
said
unconscious
with
what
application
pray
let
us
meet
in
london
meet
returned
the
other
i
have
scarcely
a
friend
there
now
but
you
where
shall
i
find
you
why
i
must
get
a
lodging
of
some
sort
said
richard
pondering
say
at
vholes
symond
inn
good
without
loss
of
time
they
shook
hands
heartily
when
i
was
seated
in
the
coach
and
richard
was
yet
standing
in
the
street
woodcourt
laid
his
friendly
hand
on
richard
shoulder
and
looked
at
me
i
understood
him
and
waved
mine
in
thanks
and
in
his
last
look
as
we
drove
away
i
saw
that
he
was
very
sorry
for
me
i
was
glad
to
see
it
i
felt
for
my
old
self
as
the
dead
may
feel
if
they
ever
revisit
these
scenes
i
was
glad
to
be
tenderly
remembered
to
be
gently
pitied
not
to
be
quite
forgotten
chapter
xlvi
stop
him
darkness
rests
upon
dilating
and
dilating
since
the
sun
went
down
last
night
it
has
gradually
swelled
until
it
fills
every
void
in
the
place
for
a
time
there
were
some
dungeon
lights
burning
as
the
lamp
of
life
hums
in
heavily
heavily
in
the
nauseous
air
and
winking
as
that
lamp
too
winks
in
at
many
horrible
things
but
they
are
blotted
out
the
moon
has
eyed
tom
with
a
dull
cold
stare
as
admitting
some
puny
emulation
of
herself
in
his
desert
region
unfit
for
life
and
blasted
by
volcanic
fires
but
she
has
passed
on
and
is
gone
the
blackest
nightmare
in
the
infernal
stables
grazes
on
and
tom
is
fast
asleep
much
mighty
there
has
been
both
in
and
out
of
parliament
concerning
tom
and
much
wrathful
disputation
how
tom
shall
be
got
right
whether
he
shall
be
put
into
the
main
road
by
constables
or
by
beadles
or
by
or
by
force
of
figures
or
by
correct
principles
of
taste
or
by
high
church
or
by
low
church
or
by
no
church
whether
he
shall
be
set
to
splitting
trusses
of
polemical
straws
with
the
crooked
knife
of
his
mind
or
whether
he
shall
be
put
to
instead
in
the
midst
of
which
dust
and
noise
there
is
but
one
thing
perfectly
clear
to
wit
that
tom
only
may
and
can
or
shall
and
will
be
reclaimed
according
to
somebody
theory
but
nobody
practice
and
in
the
hopeful
meantime
tom
goes
to
perdition
head
foremost
in
his
old
determined
spirit
but
he
has
his
revenge
even
the
winds
are
his
messengers
and
they
serve
him
in
these
hours
of
darkness
there
is
not
a
drop
of
corrupted
blood
but
propagates
infection
and
contagion
somewhere
it
shall
pollute
this
very
night
the
choice
stream
in
which
chemists
on
analysis
would
find
the
genuine
nobility
of
a
norman
house
and
his
grace
shall
not
be
able
to
say
nay
to
the
infamous
alliance
there
is
not
an
atom
of
tom
slime
not
a
cubic
inch
of
any
pestilential
gas
in
which
he
lives
not
one
obscenity
or
degradation
about
him
not
an
ignorance
not
a
wickedness
not
a
brutality
of
his
committing
but
shall
work
its
retribution
through
every
order
of
society
up
to
the
proudest
of
the
proud
and
to
the
highest
of
the
high
verily
what
with
tainting
plundering
and
spoiling
tom
has
his
revenge
it
is
a
moot
point
whether
be
uglier
by
day
or
by
night
but
on
the
argument
that
the
more
that
is
seen
of
it
the
more
shocking
it
must
be
and
that
no
part
of
it
left
to
the
imagination
is
at
all
likely
to
be
made
so
bad
as
the
reality
day
carries
it
the
day
begins
to
break
now
and
in
truth
it
might
be
better
for
the
national
glory
even
that
the
sun
should
sometimes
set
upon
the
british
dominions
than
that
it
should
ever
rise
upon
so
vile
a
wonder
as
tom
a
brown
sunburnt
gentleman
who
appears
in
some
inaptitude
for
sleep
to
be
wandering
abroad
rather
than
counting
the
hours
on
a
restless
pillow
strolls
hitherward
at
this
quiet
time
attracted
by
curiosity
he
often
pauses
and
looks
about
him
up
and
down
the
miserable
nor
is
he
merely
curious
for
in
his
bright
dark
eye
there
is
compassionate
interest
and
as
he
looks
here
and
there
he
seems
to
understand
such
wretchedness
and
to
have
studied
it
before
on
the
banks
of
the
stagnant
channel
of
mud
which
is
the
main
street
of
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
the
crazy
houses
shut
up
and
silent
no
waking
creature
save
himself
appears
except
in
one
direction
where
he
sees
the
solitary
figure
of
a
woman
sitting
on
a
he
walks
that
way
approaching
he
observes
that
she
has
journeyed
a
long
distance
and
is
footsore
and
she
sits
on
the
in
the
manner
of
one
who
is
waiting
with
her
elbow
on
her
knee
and
her
head
upon
her
hand
beside
her
is
a
canvas
bag
or
bundle
she
has
carried
she
is
dozing
probably
for
she
gives
no
heed
to
his
steps
as
he
comes
toward
her
the
broken
footway
is
so
narrow
that
when
allan
woodcourt
comes
to
where
the
woman
sits
he
has
to
turn
into
the
road
to
pass
her
looking
down
at
her
face
his
eye
meets
hers
and
he
stops
what
is
the
matter
nothing
sir
ca
you
make
them
hear
do
you
want
to
be
let
in
i
waiting
till
they
get
up
at
another
house
a
not
here
the
woman
patiently
returns
i
waiting
here
because
there
will
be
sun
here
presently
to
warm
me
i
am
afraid
you
are
tired
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
sitting
in
the
street
thank
you
sir
it
do
matter
a
habit
in
him
of
speaking
to
the
poor
and
of
avoiding
patronage
or
condescension
or
childishness
which
is
the
favourite
device
many
people
deeming
it
quite
a
subtlety
to
talk
to
them
like
little
spelling
books
has
put
him
on
good
terms
with
the
woman
easily
let
me
look
at
your
forehead
he
says
bending
down
i
am
a
doctor
do
be
afraid
i
would
hurt
you
for
the
world
he
knows
that
by
touching
her
with
his
skilful
and
accustomed
hand
he
can
soothe
her
yet
more
readily
she
makes
a
slight
objection
saying
it
nothing
but
he
has
scarcely
laid
his
fingers
on
the
wounded
place
when
she
lifts
it
up
to
the
light
aye
a
bad
bruise
and
the
skin
sadly
broken
this
must
be
very
sore
it
do
ache
a
little
sir
returns
the
woman
with
a
started
tear
upon
her
cheek
let
me
try
to
make
it
more
comfortable
my
handkerchief
wo
hurt
you
oh
dear
no
sir
i
sure
of
that
he
cleanses
the
injured
place
and
dries
it
and
having
carefully
examined
it
and
gently
pressed
it
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
takes
a
small
case
from
his
pocket
dresses
it
and
binds
it
up
while
he
is
thus
employed
he
says
after
laughing
at
his
establishing
a
surgery
in
the
street
and
so
your
husband
is
a
brickmaker
how
do
you
know
that
sir
asks
the
woman
astonished
why
i
suppose
so
from
the
colour
of
the
clay
upon
your
bag
and
on
your
dress
and
i
know
brickmakers
go
about
working
at
piecework
in
different
places
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
known
them
cruel
to
their
wives
too
the
woman
hastily
lifts
up
her
eyes
as
if
she
would
deny
that
her
injury
is
referable
to
such
a
cause
but
feeling
the
hand
upon
her
forehead
and
seeing
his
busy
and
composed
face
she
quietly
drops
them
again
where
is
he
now
asks
the
surgeon
he
got
into
trouble
last
night
sir
but
he
look
for
me
at
the
he
will
get
into
worse
trouble
if
he
often
misuses
his
large
and
heavy
hand
as
he
has
misused
it
here
but
you
forgive
him
brutal
as
he
is
and
i
say
no
more
of
him
except
that
i
wish
he
deserved
it
you
have
no
young
child
the
woman
shakes
her
head
one
as
i
calls
mine
sir
but
liz
your
own
is
dead
i
see
poor
little
thing
by
this
time
he
has
finished
and
is
putting
up
his
case
i
suppose
you
have
some
settled
home
is
it
far
from
here
he
asks
making
light
of
what
he
has
done
as
she
gets
up
and
curtsys
it
a
good
two
or
three
and
twenty
mile
from
here
sir
at
saint
albans
you
know
saint
albans
sir
i
thought
you
gave
a
start
like
as
if
you
did
yes
i
know
something
of
it
and
now
i
will
ask
you
a
question
in
return
have
you
money
for
your
lodging
yes
sir
she
says
really
and
truly
and
she
shows
it
he
tells
her
in
acknowledgment
of
her
many
subdued
thanks
that
she
is
very
welcome
gives
her
good
day
and
walks
away
is
still
asleep
and
nothing
is
astir
yes
something
is
as
he
retraces
his
way
to
the
point
from
which
he
descried
the
woman
at
a
distance
sitting
on
the
step
he
sees
a
ragged
figure
coming
very
cautiously
along
crouching
close
to
the
soiled
walls
which
the
wretchedest
figure
might
as
well
avoid
and
furtively
thrusting
a
hand
before
it
it
is
the
figure
of
a
youth
whose
face
is
hollow
and
whose
eyes
have
an
emaciated
glare
he
is
so
intent
on
getting
along
unseen
that
even
the
apparition
of
a
stranger
in
whole
garments
does
not
tempt
him
to
look
back
he
shades
his
face
with
his
ragged
elbow
as
he
passes
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
and
goes
shrinking
and
creeping
on
with
his
anxious
hand
before
him
and
his
shapeless
clothes
hanging
in
shreds
clothes
made
for
what
purpose
or
of
what
material
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
they
look
in
colour
and
in
substance
like
a
bundle
of
rank
leaves
of
swampy
growth
that
rotted
long
ago
allan
woodcourt
pauses
to
look
after
him
and
note
all
this
with
a
shadowy
belief
that
he
has
seen
the
boy
before
he
can
not
recall
how
or
where
but
there
is
some
association
in
his
mind
with
such
a
form
he
imagines
that
he
must
have
seen
it
in
some
hospital
or
refuge
still
can
not
make
out
why
it
comes
with
any
special
force
on
his
remembrance
he
is
gradually
emerging
from
in
the
morning
light
thinking
about
it
when
he
hears
running
feet
behind
him
and
looking
round
sees
the
boy
scouring
towards
him
at
great
speed
followed
by
the
woman
stop
him
stop
him
cries
the
woman
almost
breathless
stop
him
sir
he
darts
across
the
road
into
the
boy
path
but
the
boy
is
quicker
than
he
makes
a
curve
ducks
dives
under
his
hands
comes
up
yards
beyond
him
and
scours
away
again
still
the
woman
follows
crying
stop
him
sir
pray
stop
him
allan
not
knowing
but
that
he
has
just
robbed
her
of
her
money
follows
in
chase
and
runs
so
hard
that
he
runs
the
boy
down
a
dozen
times
but
each
time
he
repeats
the
curve
the
duck
the
dive
and
scours
away
again
to
strike
at
him
on
any
of
these
occasions
would
be
to
fell
and
disable
him
but
the
pursuer
can
not
resolve
to
do
that
and
so
the
grimly
ridiculous
pursuit
continues
at
last
the
fugitive
takes
to
a
narrow
passage
and
a
court
which
has
no
thoroughfare
here
against
a
hoarding
of
decaying
timber
he
is
brought
to
bay
and
tumbles
down
lying
gasping
at
his
pursuer
who
stands
and
gasps
at
him
until
the
woman
comes
up
oh
you
jo
cries
the
woman
what
i
have
found
you
at
last
jo
repeats
allan
looking
at
him
with
attention
jo
stay
to
be
sure
i
recollect
this
lad
some
time
ago
being
brought
before
the
coroner
yes
i
see
you
once
afore
at
the
inkwhich
whimpers

only
one

to

across

crossing

should
want
him
to
be
inkwhiched
i
only
wish
i
wos
myself
i
do
know
why
i
do
go
and
make
a
hole
in
the
water
i
sure
i
do
he
says
it
with
such
a
pitiable
air
and
his
grimy
tears
appear
so
real
and
he
lies
in
the
corner
up
against
the
hoarding
so
like
a
growth
of
fungus
or
any
unwholesome
excrescence
produced
there
in
neglect
and
impurity
that
allan
woodcourt
is
softened
towards
him
he
says
to
the
woman
miserable
creature
what
has
he
done
to
which
she
only
replies
shaking
her
head
at
the
prostrate
figure
more
amazedly
than
angrily
oh
you
jo
you
jo
i
have
found
you
at
last
what
has
he
done
says
allan
has
he
robbed
you
no
sir
no
robbed
me
he
did
nothing
but
what
was
by
me
and
that
the
wonder
of
it
allan
looks
from
jo
to
the
woman
and
from
the
woman
to
jo
waiting
for
one
of
them
to
unravel
the
riddle
but
he
was
along
with
me
sir
says
the
woman
oh
you
jo
he
was
along
with
me
sir
down
at
saint
albans
ill
and
a
young
lady
lord
bless
her
for
a
good
friend
to
me
took
pity
on
him
when
i
durst
and
took
him
home
allan
shrinks
back
from
him
with
a
sudden
horror
yes
sir
yes
took
him
home
and
made
him
comfortable
and
like
a
thankless
monster
he
ran
away
in
the
night
and
never
has
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
till
i
set
eyes
on
him
just
now
and
that
young
lady
that
was
such
a
pretty
dear
caught
his
illness
lost
her
beautiful
looks
and
would
hardly
be
known
for
the
same
young
lady
now
if
it
was
for
her
angel
temper
and
her
pretty
shape
and
her
sweet
voice
do
you
know
it
you
ungrateful
wretch
do
you
know
that
this
is
all
along
of
you
and
of
her
goodness
to
you
demands
the
woman
beginning
to
rage
at
him
as
she
recalls
it
and
breaking
into
passionate
tears
the
boy
in
rough
sort
stunned
by
what
he
hears
falls
to
smearing
his
dirty
forehead
with
his
dirty
palm
and
to
staring
at
the
ground
and
to
shaking
from
head
to
foot
until
the
crazy
hoarding
against
which
he
leans
rattles
allan
restrains
the
woman
merely
by
a
quiet
gesture
but
effectually
richard
told
me
he
falters
i
mean
i
have
heard
of
this
mind
me
for
a
moment
i
will
speak
presently
he
turns
away
and
stands
for
a
while
looking
out
at
the
covered
passage
when
he
comes
back
he
has
recovered
his
composure
except
that
he
contends
against
an
avoidance
of
the
boy
which
is
so
very
remarkable
that
it
absorbs
the
woman
attention
you
hear
what
she
says
but
get
up
get
up
jo
shaking
and
chattering
slowly
rises
and
stands
after
the
manner
of
his
tribe
in
a
difficulty
sideways
against
the
hoarding
resting
one
of
his
high
shoulders
against
it
and
covertly
rubbing
his
right
hand
over
his
left
and
his
left
foot
over
his
right
you
hear
what
she
says
and
i
know
it
true
have
you
been
here
ever
since
wishermaydie
if
i
seen
till
this
blessed
morning
replies
jo
hoarsely
why
have
you
come
here
now
jo
looks
all
round
the
confined
court
looks
at
his
questioner
no
higher
than
the
knees
and
finally
answers
i
do
know
how
to
do
nothink
and
i
ca
get
nothink
to
do
i
wery
poor
and
ill
and
i
thought
i
come
back
here
when
there
war
nobody
about
and
lay
down
and
hide
somewheres
as
i
knows
on
till
arter
dark
and
then
go
and
beg
a
trifle
of
snagsby
he
wos
allus
willin
fur
to
give
me
somethink
he
wos
though
snagsby
she
was
allus
on
me
like
everybody
everywheres
where
have
you
come
from
jo
looks
all
round
the
court
again
looks
at
his
questioner
knees
again
and
concludes
by
laying
his
profile
against
the
hoarding
in
a
sort
of
resignation
did
you
hear
me
ask
you
where
you
have
come
from
tramp
then
says
jo
now
tell
me
proceeds
allan
making
a
strong
effort
to
overcome
his
repugnance
going
very
near
to
him
and
leaning
over
him
with
an
expression
of
confidence
tell
me
how
it
came
about
that
you
left
that
house
when
the
good
young
lady
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
pity
you
and
take
you
home
jo
suddenly
comes
out
of
his
resignation
and
excitedly
declares
addressing
the
woman
that
he
never
known
about
the
young
lady
that
he
never
heern
about
it
that
he
never
went
fur
to
hurt
her
that
he
would
sooner
have
hurt
his
own
self
that
he
sooner
have
had
his
unfortnet
ed
chopped
off
than
ever
gone
her
and
that
she
wos
wery
good
to
him
she
wos
conducting
himself
throughout
as
if
in
his
poor
fashion
he
really
meant
it
and
winding
up
with
some
very
miserable
sobs
allan
woodcourt
sees
that
this
is
not
a
sham
he
constrains
himself
to
touch
him
come
jo
tell
me
no
i
dust
says
jo
relapsing
into
the
profile
state
i
dust
or
i
would
but
i
must
know
returns
the
other
all
the
same
come
jo
after
two
or
three
such
adjurations
jo
lifts
up
his
head
again
looks
round
the
court
again
and
says
in
a
low
voice
well
tell
you
something
i
was
took
away
there
took
away
in
the
night
ah
very
apprehensive
of
being
overheard
jo
looks
about
him
and
even
glances
up
some
ten
feet
at
the
top
of
the
hoarding
and
through
the
cracks
in
it
lest
the
object
of
his
distrust
should
be
looking
over
or
hidden
on
the
other
side
who
took
you
away
i
dust
name
him
says
jo
i
dust

but
i

young
lady

may
trust
me

one

but

replies
jo
shaking
his
head
fearfully
as
he
do
hear
why
he
is
not
in
this
place
oh
ai
he
though
says
jo
he
in
all
manner
of
places
all
at
wanst
allan
looks
at
him
in
perplexity
but
discovers
some
real
meaning
and
good
faith
at
the
bottom
of
this
bewildering
reply
he
patiently
awaits
an
explicit
answer
and
jo
more
baffled
by
his
patience
than
by
anything
else
at
last
desperately
whispers
a
name
in
his
ear
aye
says
allan
why
what
had
you
been
doing
nothink

done
nothink
to

ground
concludes
jo
nervously
repeating
all
his
former
precautions
and
investigations
allan
considers
a
little
then
remarks
turning
to
the
woman
but
keeping
an
encouraging
eye
on
jo
he
is
not
so
ungrateful
as
you
supposed
he
had
a
reason
for
going

an
insufficient
one
thankee

and
i
will
find

a
better
place
than
this
to
lie
down
and
hide
in
if
i
take
one
side
of
the
way
and
you
the
other
to
avoid

you
will
not
run

well
if

hour
come
along
good
day
again
my
good
woman
good
day
again
sir
and
i
thank
you
kindly
many
times
again
she
has
been
sitting
on
her
bag
deeply
attentive
and
now
rises
and
takes
it
up
jo
repeating
ony
you
tell
the
young
lady
as
i
never
went
fur
to
hurt
her
and
wot
the
genlmn
ses
nods
and
shambles
and
shivers
and
smears
and
blinks
and
half
laughs
and
half
cries
a
farewell
to
her
and
takes
his
creeping
way
along
after
allan
woodcourt
close
to
the
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
in
this
order
the
two
come
up
out
of
into
the
broad
rays
of
the
sunlight
and
the
purer
air
chapter
xlvii
jo
will
as
allan
woodcourt
and
jo
proceed
along
the
streets
where
the
high
church
spires
and
the
distances
are
so
near
and
clear
in
the
morning
light
that
the
city
itself
seems
renewed
by
rest
allan
revolves
in
his
mind
how
and
where
he
shall
bestow
his
companion
it
surely
is
a
strange
fact
he
considers
that
in
the
heart
of
a
civilized
world
this
creature
in
human
form
should
be
more
difficult
to
dispose
of
than
an
unowned
dog
but
it
is
none
the
less
a
fact
because
of
its
strangeness
and
the
difficulty
remains
at
first
he
looks
behind
him
often
to
assure
himself
that
jo
is
still
really
following
but
look
where
he
will
he
still
beholds
him
close
to
the
opposite
houses
making
his
way
with
his
wary
hand
from
brick
to
brick
and
from
door
to
door
and
often
as
he
creeps
along
glancing
over
at
him
watchfully
soon
satisfied
that
the
last
thing
in
his
thoughts
is
to
give
him
the
slip
allan
goes
on
considering
with
a
less
divided
attention
what
he
shall
do
a
at
a
suggests
the
first
thing
to
be
done
he
stops
there
looks
round
and
beckons
jo
jo
crosses
and
comes
halting
and
shuffling
up
slowly
scooping
the
knuckles
of
his
right
hand
round
and
round
in
the
hollowed
palm
of
his
left
kneading
dirt
with
a
natural
pestle
and
mortar
what
is
a
dainty
repast
to
jo
is
then
set
before
him
and
he
begins
to
gulp
the
coffee
and
to
gnaw
the
bread
and
butter
looking
anxiously
about
him
in
all
directions
as
he
eats
and
drinks
like
a
scared
animal
but
he
is
so
sick
and
miserable
that
even
hunger
has
abandoned
him
i
thought
i
was
amost
sir
says
jo
soon
putting
down
his
food
but
i
do
know
nothink
not
even
that
i
do
care
for
eating
wittles
nor
yet
for
drinking
on
and
jo
stands
shivering
and
looking
at
the
breakfast
wonderingly
allan
woodcourt
lays
his
hand
upon
his
pulse
and
on
his
chest
draw
breath
jo
it
draws
says
jo
as
heavy
as
a
cart
he
might
add
and
rattles
like
it
but
he
only
mutters
i
on
sir
allan
looks
about
for
an
apothecary
shop
there
is
none
at
hand
but
a
tavern
does
as
well
or
better
he
obtains
a
little
measure
of
wine
and
gives
the
lad
a
portion
of
it
very
carefully
he
begins
to
revive
almost
as
soon
as
it
passes
his
lips
we
may
repeat
that
dose
jo
observes
allan
after
watching
him
with
his
attentive
face
so
now
we
will
take
five
minutes
rest
and
then
go
on
again
leaving
the
boy
sitting
on
the
bench
of
the
with
his
back
against
an
iron
railing
allan
woodcourt
paces
up
and
down
in
the
early
sunshine
casting
an
occasional
look
towards
him
without
appearing
to
watch
him
it
requires
no
discernment
to
perceive
that
he
is
warmed
and
refreshed
if
a
face
so
shaded
can
brighten
his
face
brightens
somewhat
and
by
little
and
little
he
eats
the
slice
of
bread
he
had
so
hopelessly
laid
down
observant
of
these
signs
of
improvement
allan
engages
him
in
conversation
and
elicits
to
his
no
small
wonder
the
adventure
of
the
lady
in
the
veil
with
all
its
consequences
jo
slowly
munches
as
he
slowly
tells
it
when
he
has
finished
his
story
and
his
bread
they
go
on
again
intending
to
refer
his
difficulty
in
finding
a
temporary
place
of
refuge
for
the
boy
to
his
old
patient
zealous
little
miss
flite
allan
leads
the
way
to
the
court
where
he
and
jo
first
foregathered
but
all
is
changed
at
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
miss
flite
no
longer
lodges
there
it
is
shut
up
and
a
female
much
obscured
by
dust
whose
age
is
a
problem
but
who
is
indeed
no
other
than
the
interesting
judy
is
tart
and
spare
in
her
replies
these
sufficing
however
to
inform
the
visitor
that
miss
flite
and
her
birds
are
domiciled
with
a
blinder
in
bell
yard
he
repairs
to
that
neighbouring
place
where
miss
flite
who
rises
early
that
she
may
be
punctual
at
the
divan
of
justice
held
by
her
excellent
friend
the
chancellor
comes
running
downstairs
with
tears
of
welcome
and
with
open
arms
my
dear
physician
cries
miss
flite
my
meritorious
distinguished
honourable
officer
she
uses
some
odd
expressions
but
is
as
cordial
and
full
of
heart
as
sanity
itself
can
be
more
so
than
it
often
is
allan
very
patient
with
her
waits
until
she
has
no
more
raptures
to
express
then
points
out
jo
trembling
in
a
doorway
and
tells
her
how
he
comes
there
where
can
i
lodge
him
hereabouts
for
the
present
now
you
have
a
fund
of
knowledge
and
good
sense
and
can
advise
me
miss
flite
mighty
proud
of
the
compliment
sets
herself
to
consider
but
it
is
long
before
a
bright
thought
occurs
to
her
blinder
is
entirely
let
and
she
herself
occupies
poor
gridley
room
gridley
exclaims
miss
flite
clapping
her
hands
after
a
twentieth
repetition
of
this
remark
gridley
to
be
sure
of
course
my
dear
physician
general
george
will
help
us
out
it
is
hopeless
to
ask
for
any
information
about
general
george
and
would
be
though
miss
flite
had
not
already
run
upstairs
to
put
on
her
pinched
bonnet
and
her
poor
little
shawl
and
to
arm
herself
with
her
reticule
of
documents
but
as
she
informs
her
physician
in
her
disjointed
manner
on
coming
down
in
full
array
that
general
george
whom
she
often
calls
upon
knows
her
dear
fitz
jarndyce
and
takes
a
great
interest
in
all
connected
with
her
allan
is
induced
to
think
that
they
may
be
in
the
right
way
so
he
tells
jo
for
his
encouragement
that
this
walking
about
will
soon
be
over
now
and
they
repair
to
the
general
fortunately
it
is
not
far
from
the
exterior
of
george
shooting
gallery
and
the
long
entry
and
the
bare
perspective
beyond
it
allan
woodcourt
augurs
well
he
also
descries
promise
in
the
figure
of
george
himself
striding
towards
them
in
his
morning
exercise
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
no
stock
on
and
his
muscular
arms
developed
by
broadsword
and
dumbbell
weightily
asserting
themselves
through
his
light
your
servant
sir
says
george
with
a
military
salute
smiling
all
over
his
broad
forehead
up
into
his
crisp
hair
he
then
defers
to
miss
flite
as
with
great
stateliness
and
at
some
length
she
performs
the
courtly
ceremony
of
presentation
he
winds
it
up
with
another
your
servant
sir
and
another
salute
excuse
me
sir
a
sailor
i
believe
says
george
i
am
proud
to
find
i
have
the
air
of
one
returns
allan
but
i
am
only
a
doctor
indeed
sir
i
should
have
thought
you
was
a
regular
myself
allan
hopes
george
will
forgive
his
intrusion
the
more
readily
on
that
account
and
particularly
that
he
will
not
lay
aside
his
pipe
which
in
his
politeness
he
has
testified
some
intention
of
doing
you
are
very
good
sir
returns
the
trooper
as
i
know
by
experience
that
it
not
disagreeable
to
miss
flite
and
since
equally
agreeable
to
yourself
and
finishes
the
sentence
by
putting
it
between
his
lips
again
allan
proceeds
to
tell
him
all
he
knows
about
jo
unto
which
the
trooper
listens
with
a
grave
face
and
that
the
lad
sir
is
it
he
inquires
looking
along
the
entry
to
where
jo
stands
staring
up
at
the
great
letters
on
the
whitewashed
front
which
have
no
meaning
in
his
eyes
that
he
says
allan
and
george
i
am
in
this
difficulty
about
him
i
am
unwilling
to
place
him
in
a
hospital
even
if
i
could
procure
him
immediate
admission
because
i
foresee
that
he
would
not
stay
there
many
hours
if
he
could
be
so
much
as
got
there
the
same
objection
applies
to
a
workhouse
supposing
i
had
the
patience
to
be
evaded
and
shirked
and
handed
about
from
post
to
pillar
in
trying
to
get
him
into
one
which
is
a
system
that
i
do
take
kindly
to
no
man
does
sir
returns
george
i
am
convinced
that
he
would
not
remain
in
either
place
because
he
is
possessed
by
an
extraordinary
terror
of
this
person
who
ordered
him
to
keep
out
of
the
way
in
his
ignorance
he
believes
this
person
to
be
everywhere
and
cognizant
of
everything
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
says
george
but
you
have
not
mentioned
that
party
name
is
it
a
secret
sir
the
boy
makes
it
one
but
his
name
is
bucket
bucket
the
detective
sir
the
same
man
the
man
is
known
to
me
sir
returns
the
trooper
after
blowing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
squaring
his
chest
and
the
boy
is
so
far
correct
that
he
undoubtedly
is
a
rum
customer
george
smokes
with
a
profound
meaning
after
this
and
surveys
miss
flite
in
silence
now
i
wish
jarndyce
and
miss
summerson
at
least
to
know
that
this
jo
who
tells
so
strange
a
story
has
reappeared
and
to
have
it
in
their
power
to
speak
with
him
if
they
should
desire
to
do
so
therefore
i
want
to
get
him
for
the
present
moment
into
any
poor
lodging
kept
by
decent
people
where
he
would
be
admitted
decent
people
and
jo
george
says
allan
following
the
direction
of
the
trooper
eyes
along
the
entry
have
not
been
much
acquainted
as
you
see
hence
the
difficulty
do
you
happen
to
know
any
one
in
this
neighbourhood
who
would
receive
him
for
a
while
on
my
paying
for
him
beforehand
as
he
puts
the
question
he
becomes
aware
of
a
little
man
standing
at
the
trooper
elbow
and
looking
up
with
an
oddly
twisted
figure
and
countenance
into
the
trooper
face
after
a
few
more
puffs
at
his
pipe
the
trooper
looks
down
askant
at
the
little
man
and
the
little
man
winks
up
at
the
trooper
well
sir
says
george
i
can
assure
you
that
i
would
willingly
be
knocked
on
the
head
at
any
time
if
it
would
be
at
all
agreeable
to
miss
summerson
and
consequently
i
esteem
it
a
privilege
to
do
that
young
lady
any
service
however
small
we
are
naturally
in
the
vagabond
way
here
sir
both
myself
and
phil
you
see
what
the
place
is
you
are
welcome
to
a
quiet
corner
of
it
for
the
boy
if
the
same
would
meet
your
views
no
charge
made
except
for
rations
we
are
not
in
a
flourishing
state
of
circumstances
here
sir
we
are
liable
to
be
tumbled
out
neck
and
crop
at
a
moment
notice
however
sir
such
as
the
place
is
and
so
long
as
it
lasts
here
it
is
at
your
service
with
a
comprehensive
wave
of
his
pipe
george
places
the
whole
building
at
his
visitor
disposal
i
take
it
for
granted
sir
he
adds
you
being
one
of
the
medical
staff
that
there
is
no
present
infection
about
this
unfortunate
subject
allan
is
quite
sure
of
it
because
sir
says
george
shaking
his
head
sorrowfully
we
have
had
enough
of
that
his
tone
is
no
less
sorrowfully
echoed
by
his
new
acquaintance
still
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
observes
allan
after
repeating
his
former
assurance
that
the
boy
is
deplorably
low
and
reduced
and
that
he
may
be
i
do
not
say
that
he
is
too
far
gone
to
recover
do
you
consider
him
in
present
danger
sir
inquires
the
trooper
yes
i
fear
so
then
sir
returns
the
trooper
in
a
decisive
manner
it
appears
to
me
being
naturally
in
the
vagabond
way
myself
that
the
sooner
he
comes
out
of
the
street
the
better
you
phil
bring
him
in
squod
tacks
out
all
on
one
side
to
execute
the
word
of
command
and
the
trooper
having
smoked
his
pipe
lays
it
by
jo
is
brought
in
he
is
not
one
of
pardiggle
tockahoopo
indians
he
is
not
one
of
jellyby
lambs
being
wholly
unconnected
with
he
is
not
softened
by
distance
and
unfamiliarity
he
is
not
a
genuine
savage
he
is
the
ordinary
article
dirty
ugly
disagreeable
to
all
the
senses
in
body
a
common
creature
of
the
common
streets
only
in
soul
a
heathen
homely
filth
begrimes
him
homely
parasites
devour
him
homely
sores
are
in
him
homely
rags
are
on
him
native
ignorance
the
growth
of
english
soil
and
climate
sinks
his
immortal
nature
lower
than
the
beasts
that
perish
stand
forth
jo
in
uncompromising
colours
from
the
sole
of
thy
foot
to
the
crown
of
thy
head
there
is
nothing
interesting
about
thee
he
shuffles
slowly
into
george
gallery
and
stands
huddled
together
in
a
bundle
looking
all
about
the
floor
he
seems
to
know
that
they
have
an
inclination
to
shrink
from
him
partly
for
what
he
is
and
partly
for
what
he
has
caused
he
too
shrinks
from
them
he
is
not
of
the
same
order
of
things
not
of
the
same
place
in
creation
he
is
of
no
order
and
no
place
neither
of
the
beasts
nor
of
humanity
look
here
jo
says
allan
this
is
mr
george
jo
searches
the
floor
for
some
time
longer
then
looks
up
for
a
moment
and
then
down
again
he
is
a
kind
friend
to
you
for
he
is
going
to
give
you
lodging
room
here
jo
makes
a
scoop
with
one
hand
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
bow
after
a
little
more
consideration
and
some
backing
and
changing
of
the
foot
on
which
he
rests
he
mutters
that
he
is
wery
thankful
you
are
quite
safe
here
all
you
have
to
do
at
present
is
to
be
obedient
and
to
get
strong
and
mind
you
tell
us
the
truth
here
whatever
you
do
jo
wishermaydie
if
i
do
sir
says
jo
reverting
to
his
favourite
declaration
i
never
done
nothink
yit
but
wot
you
knows
on
to
get
myself
into
no
trouble
i
never
was
in
no
other
trouble
at
all
sir
not
knowin
nothink
and
starwation
i
believe
it
now
attend
to
george
i
see
he
is
going
to
speak
to
you
my
intention
merely
was
sir
observes
george
amazingly
broad
and
upright
to
point
out
to
him
where
he
can
lie
down
and
get
a
thorough
good
dose
of
sleep
now
look
here
as
the
trooper
speaks
he
conducts
them
to
the
other
end
of
the
gallery
and
opens
one
of
the
little
cabins
there
you
are
you
see
here
is
a
mattress
and
here
you
may
rest
on
good
behaviour
as
long
as
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
he
refers
apologetically
to
the
card
allan
has
given
him
woodcourt
pleases
do
you
be
alarmed
if
you
hear
shots
they
be
aimed
at
the
target
and
not
you
now
there
another
thing
i
would
recommend
sir
says
the
trooper
turning
to
his
visitor
phil
come
here
phil
bears
down
upon
them
according
to
his
usual
tactics
here
is
a
man
sir
who
was
found
when
a
baby
in
the
gutter
consequently
it
is
to
be
expected
that
he
takes
a
natural
interest
in
this
poor
creature
you
do
do
you
phil
certainly
and
surely
i
do
is
phil
reply
now
i
was
thinking
sir
says
george
in
a
martial
sort
of
confidence
as
if
he
were
giving
his
opinion
in
a
council
of
war
at
a
that
if
this
man
was
to
take
him
to
a
bath
and
was
to
lay
out
a
few
shillings
in
getting
him
one
or
two
coarse
articles
george
my
considerate
friend
returns
allan
taking
out
his
purse
it
is
the
very
favour
i
would
have
asked
phil
squod
and
jo
are
sent
out
immediately
on
this
work
of
improvement
miss
flite
quite
enraptured
by
her
success
makes
the
best
of
her
way
to
court
having
great
fears
that
otherwise
her
friend
the
chancellor
may
be
uneasy
about
her
or
may
give
the
judgment
she
has
so
long
expected
in
her
absence
and
observing
which
you
know
my
dear
physician
and
general
after
so
many
years
would
be
too
absurdly
unfortunate
allan
takes
the
opportunity
of
going
out
to
procure
some
restorative
medicines
and
obtaining
them
near
at
hand
soon
returns
to
find
the
trooper
walking
up
and
down
the
gallery
and
to
fall
into
step
and
walk
with
him
i
take
it
sir
says
george
that
you
know
miss
summerson
pretty
well
yes
it
appears
not
related
to
her
sir
no
it
appears
excuse
the
apparent
curiosity
says
george
it
seemed
to
me
probable
that
you
might
take
more
than
a
common
interest
in
this
poor
creature
because
miss
summerson
had
taken
that
unfortunate
interest
in
him
is
my
case
sir
i
assure
you
and
mine
mr
george
the
trooper
looks
sideways
at
allan
sunburnt
cheek
and
bright
dark
eye
rapidly
measures
his
height
and
build
and
seems
to
approve
of
him
since
you
have
been
out
sir
i
have
been
thinking
that
i
unquestionably
know
the
rooms
in
lincoln
inn
fields
where
bucket
took
the
lad
according
to
his
account
though
he
is
not
acquainted
with
the
name
i
can
help
you
to
it
it
tulkinghorn
that
what
it
is
allan
looks
at
him
inquiringly
repeating
the
name
tulkinghorn
that
the
name
sir
i
know
the
man
and
know
him
to
have
been
in
communication
with
bucket
before
respecting
a
deceased
person
who
had
given
him
offence
i
know
the
man
sir
to
my
sorrow
allan
naturally
asks
what
kind
of
man
he
is
what
kind
of
man
do
you
mean
to
look
at
i
think
i
know
that
much
of
him
i
mean
to
deal
with
generally
what
kind
of
man
why
then
i
tell
you
sir
returns
the
trooper
stopping
short
and
folding
his
arms
on
his
square
chest
so
angrily
that
his
face
fires
and
flushes
all
over
he
is
a
confoundedly
bad
kind
of
man
he
is
a
kind
of
man
he
is
no
more
like
flesh
and
blood
than
a
rusty
old
carbine
is
he
is
a
kind
of
man
by
george
that
has
caused
me
more
restlessness
and
more
uneasiness
and
more
dissatisfaction
with
myself
than
all
other
men
put
together
the
kind
of
man
tulkinghorn
is
i
am
sorry
says
allan
to
have
touched
so
sore
a
place
sore
the
trooper
plants
his
legs
wider
apart
wets
the
palm
of
his
broad
right
hand
and
lays
it
on
the
imaginary
moustache
it
no
fault
of
yours
sir
but
you
shall
judge
he
has
got
a
power
over
me
he
is
the
man
i
spoke
of
just
now
as
being
able
to
tumble
me
out
of
this
place
neck
and
crop
he
keeps
me
on
a
constant
he
hold
off
and
he
wo
come
on
if
i
have
a
payment
to
make
him
or
time
to
ask
him
for
or
anything
to
go
to
him
about
he
do
see
me
do
hear
me
passes
me
on
to
melchisedech
in
clifford
inn
melchisedech
in
clifford
inn
passes
me
back
again
to
him
he
keeps
me
prowling
and
dangling
about
him
as
if
i
was
made
of
the
same
stone
as
himself
why
i
spend
half
my
life
now
pretty
well
loitering
and
dodging
about
his
door
what
does
he
care
nothing
just
as
much
as
the
rusty
old
carbine
i
have
compared
him
to
he
chafes
and
goads
me
till
bah
nonsense
i
am
forgetting
myself
woodcourt
the
trooper
resumes
his
march
all
i
say
is
he
is
an
old
man
but
i
am
glad
i
shall
never
have
the
chance
of
setting
spurs
to
my
horse
and
riding
at
him
in
a
fair
field
for
if
i
had
that
chance
in
one
of
the
humours
he
drives
me
into
he
go
down
sir
george
has
been
so
excited
that
he
finds
it
necessary
to
wipe
his
forehead
on
his
even
while
he
whistles
his
impetuosity
away
with
the
national
anthem
some
involuntary
shakings
of
his
head
and
heavings
of
his
chest
still
linger
behind
not
to
mention
an
occasional
hasty
adjustment
with
both
hands
of
his
open
as
if
it
were
scarcely
open
enough
to
prevent
his
being
troubled
by
a
choking
sensation
in
short
allan
woodcourt
has
not
much
doubt
about
the
going
down
of
tulkinghorn
on
the
field
referred
to
jo
and
his
conductor
presently
return
and
jo
is
assisted
to
his
mattress
by
the
careful
phil
to
whom
after
due
administration
of
medicine
by
his
own
hands
allan
confides
all
needful
means
and
instructions
the
morning
is
by
this
time
getting
on
apace
he
repairs
to
his
lodgings
to
dress
and
breakfast
and
then
without
seeking
rest
goes
away
to
jarndyce
to
communicate
his
discovery
with
him
jarndyce
returns
alone
confidentially
telling
him
that
there
are
reasons
for
keeping
this
matter
very
quiet
indeed
and
showing
a
serious
interest
in
it
to
jarndyce
jo
repeats
in
substance
what
he
said
in
the
morning
without
any
material
variation
only
that
cart
of
his
is
heavier
to
draw
and
draws
with
a
hollower
sound
let
me
lay
here
quiet
and
not
be
chivied
no
more
falters
jo
and
be
so
kind
any
person
as
is
nigh
where
i
used
fur
to
sleep
as
jist
to
say
to
sangsby
that
jo
wot
he
known
once
is
on
right
forards
with
his
duty
and
i
be
wery
thankful
i
be
more
thankful
than
i
am
aready
if
it
wos
any
ways
possible
for
an
unfortnet
to
be
it
he
makes
so
many
of
these
references
to
the
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
that
allan
after
conferring
with
jarndyce
resolves
to
call
in
cook
court
the
rather
as
the
cart
seems
to
be
breaking
down
to
cook
court
therefore
he
repairs
snagsby
is
behind
his
counter
in
his
grey
coat
and
sleeves
inspecting
an
indenture
of
several
skins
which
has
just
come
in
from
the
engrosser
an
immense
desert
of
and
parchment
with
here
and
there
a
of
a
few
large
letters
to
break
the
awful
monotony
and
save
the
traveller
from
despair
mr
snagsby
puts
up
at
one
of
these
inky
wells
and
greets
the
stranger
with
his
cough
of
general
preparation
for
business
you
do
remember
me
mr
snagsby
the
stationer
heart
begins
to
thump
heavily
for
his
old
apprehensions
have
never
abated
it
is
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
answer
no
sir
i
ca
say
i
do
i
should
have
considered
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
that
i
never
saw
you
before
sir
twice
before
says
allan
woodcourt
once
at
a
poor
bedside
and
once
it
come
at
last
thinks
the
afflicted
stationer
as
recollection
breaks
upon
him
it
got
to
a
head
now
and
is
going
to
burst
but
he
has
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
conduct
his
visitor
into
the
little
and
to
shut
the
door
are
you
a
married
man
sir
no
i
am
not
would
you
make
the
attempt
though
single
says
snagsby
in
a
melancholy
whisper
to
speak
as
low
as
you
can
for
my
little
woman
is
somewheres
or
i
forfeit
the
business
and
five
hundred
pound
in
deep
dejection
snagsby
sits
down
on
his
stool
with
his
back
against
his
desk
protesting
i
never
had
a
secret
of
my
own
sir
i
ca
charge
my
memory
with
ever
having
once
attempted
to
deceive
my
little
woman
on
my
own
account
since
she
named
the
day
i
have
done
it
sir
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
i
have
done
it
i
durs
have
done
it
whereas
and
nevertheless
i
find
myself
wrapped
round
with
secrecy
and
mystery
till
my
life
is
a
burden
to
me
his
visitor
professes
his
regret
to
hear
it
and
asks
him
does
he
remember
jo
snagsby
answers
with
a
suppressed
groan
oh
he
you
could
name
an
individual
human
being
except
myself
that
my
little
woman
is
more
set
and
determined
against
than
jo
says
snagsby
allan
asks
why
why
repeats
snagsby
in
his
desperation
clutching
at
the
clump
of
hair
at
the
back
of
his
bald
head
how
should
i
know
why
but
you
are
a
single
person
sir
and
may
you
long
be
spared
to
ask
a
married
person
such
a
question
with
this
beneficent
wish
snagsby
coughs
a
cough
of
dismal
resignation
and
submits
himself
to
hear
what
the
visitor
has
to
communicate
there
again
says
snagsby
who
between
the
earnestness
of
his
feelings
and
the
suppressed
tones
of
his
voice
is
discoloured
in
the
face
at
it
again
in
a
new
direction
a
certain
person
charges
me
in
the
solemnest
way
not
to
talk
of
jo
to
any
one
even
my
little
woman
then
comes
another
certain
person
in
the
person
of
yourself
and
charges
me
in
an
equally
solemn
way
not
to
mention
jo
to
that
other
certain
person
above
all
other
persons
why
this
is
a
private
asylum
why
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
this
is
bedlam
sir
says
snagsby
but
it
is
better
than
he
expected
after
all
being
no
explosion
of
the
mine
below
him
or
deepening
of
the
pit
into
which
he
has
fallen
and
being
and
affected
by
the
account
he
hears
of
condition
he
readily
engages
to
look
round
as
early
in
the
evening
as
he
can
manage
it
quietly
he
looks
round
very
quietly
when
the
evening
comes
but
it
may
turn
out
that
snagsby
is
as
quiet
a
manager
as
he
jo
is
very
glad
to
see
his
old
friend
and
says
when
they
are
left
alone
that
he
takes
it
uncommon
kind
as
sangsby
should
come
so
far
out
of
his
way
on
accounts
of
sich
as
him
snagsby
touched
by
the
spectacle
before
him
immediately
lays
upon
the
table
half
a
crown
that
magic
balsam
of
his
for
all
kinds
of
wounds
and
how
do
you
find
yourself
my
poor
lad
inquires
the
stationer
with
his
cough
of
sympathy
i
am
in
luck

jo

do
want

i
wery
sorry
that
i
done
it
but
i
did
go
fur
to
do
it
sir
the
stationer
softly
lays
down
another
and
asks
him
what
it
is
that
he
is
sorry
for
having
done
sangsby
says
jo
i
went
and
giv
a
illness
to
the
lady
as
wos
and
yit
as
war
the
lady
and
none
of

she

bold
i
see

tears
mr
sangsby
the
softened
stationer
deposits
another
on
the
table
nothing
less
than
a
repetition
of
that
infallible
remedy
will
relieve
his
feelings
wot

was
on

and

allus
grieved
over

and
that
i
hoped
as
he
be
able
to
forgive
me
in
his
mind
if

writin
could
be
made
to

thankee

and
it
makes
me
more
cumfbler
nor
i
was
afore
the
meek
little
stationer
with
a
broken
and
unfinished
cough
slips
down
his
fourth
he
has
never
been
so
close
to
a
case
requiring
so
many
and
is
fain
to
depart
and
jo
and
he
upon
this
little
earth
shall
meet
no
more
no
more
for
the
cart
so
hard
to
draw
is
near
its
journey
end
and
drags
over
stony
ground
all
round
the
clock
it
labours
up
the
broken
steps
shattered
and
worn
not
many
times
can
the
sun
rise
and
behold
it
still
upon
its
weary
road
phil
squod
with
his
smoky
gunpowder
visage
at
once
acts
as
nurse
and
works
as
armourer
at
his
little
table
in
a
corner
often
looking
round
and
saying
with
a
nod
of
his
cap
and
an
encouraging
elevation
of
his
one
eyebrow
hold
up
my
boy
hold
up
there
too
is
jarndyce
many
a
time
and
allan
woodcourt
almost
always
both
thinking
much
how
strangely
fate
has
entangled
this
rough
outcast
in
the
web
of
very
different
lives
there
too
the
trooper
is
a
frequent
visitor
filling
the
doorway
with
his
athletic
figure
and
from
his
superfluity
of
life
and
strength
seeming
to
shed
down
temporary
vigour
upon
jo
who
never
fails
to
speak
more
robustly
in
answer
to
his
cheerful
words
jo
is
in
a
sleep
or
in
a
stupor
and
allan
woodcourt
newly
arrived
stands
by
him
looking
down
upon
his
wasted
form
after
a
while
he
softly
seats
himself
upon
the
bedside
with
his
face
towards
him
just
as
he
sat
in
the
room
and
touches
his
chest
and
heart
the
cart
had
very
nearly
given
up
but
labours
on
a
little
more
the
trooper
stands
in
the
doorway
still
and
silent
phil
has
stopped
in
a
low
clinking
noise
with
his
little
hammer
in
his
hand
woodcourt
looks
round
with
that
grave
professional
interest
and
attention
on
his
face
and
glancing
significantly
at
the
trooper
signs
to
phil
to
carry
his
table
out
when
the
little
hammer
is
next
used
there
will
be
a
speck
of
rust
upon
it
well
jo
what
is
the
matter
do
be
frightened
i
thought
says
jo
who
has
started
and
is
looking
round
i
thought
i
was
in
agin
ai
there
nobody
here
but
you
mr
woodcot
nobody
and
i
ai
took
back
to
am
i
sir
no
jo
closes
his
eyes
muttering
i
wery
thankful
after
watching
him
closely
a
little
while
allan
puts
his
mouth
very
near
his
ear
and
says
to
him
in
a
low
distinct
voice
jo
did
you
ever
know
a
prayer

knowd
nothink
sir
not
so
much
as
one
short
prayer
no

he
prayed
a
lot
but
i
could
make
out
nothink

different
times

other
genlmen

down
but
they
all
mostly
sed

to
theirselves
or
blame
on
the
and
not
to
us
we
never
knowd
nothink
i
never
knowd
what
it
wos
all
about

takes
him
a
long
time
to
say
this
and
few
but
an
experienced
and
attentive
listener
could
hear
or
hearing
understand
him
after
a
short
relapse
into
sleep
or
stupor
he
makes
of
a
sudden
a
strong
effort
to
get
out
of
bed

what

exhausted
by
looking
out
of
window
are
reposing
in
the
hall
and
hang
their
heavy
heads
the
gorgeous
creatures
like
overblown
sunflowers
like
them
too
they
seem
to
run
to
a
deal
of
seed
in
their
tags
and
trimmings
sir
leicester
in
the
library
has
fallen
asleep
for
the
good
of
the
country
over
the
report
of
a
parliamentary
committee
my
lady
sits
in
the
room
in
which
she
gave
audience
to
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
rosa
is
with
her
and
has
been
writing
for
her
and
reading
to
her
rosa
is
now
at
work
upon
embroidery
or
some
such
pretty
thing
and
as
she
bends
her
head
over
it
my
lady
watches
her
in
silence
not
for
the
first
time
rosa
the
pretty
village
face
looks
brightly
up
then
seeing
how
serious
my
lady
is
looks
puzzled
and
surprised
see
to
the
door
is
it
shut
yes
she
goes
to
it
and
returns
and
looks
yet
more
surprised
i
am
about
to
place
confidence
in
you
child
for
i
know
i
may
trust
your
attachment
if
not
your
judgment
in
what
i
am
going
to
do
i
will
not
disguise
myself
to
you
at
least
but
i
confide
in
you
say
nothing
to
any
one
of
what
passes
between
us
the
timid
little
beauty
promises
in
all
earnestness
to
be
trustworthy
do
you
know
lady
dedlock
asks
her
signing
to
her
to
bring
her
chair
nearer
do
you
know
rosa
that
i
am
different
to
you
from
what
i
am
to
any
one
yes
my
lady
much
kinder
but
then
i
often
think
i
know
you
as
you
really
are
you
often
think
you
know
me
as
i
really
am
poor
child
poor
child
she
says
it
with
a
kind
of
scorn
though
not
of
rosa
and
sits
brooding
looking
dreamily
at
her
do
you
think
rosa
you
are
any
relief
or
comfort
to
me
do
you
suppose
your
being
young
and
natural
and
fond
of
me
and
grateful
to
me
makes
it
any
pleasure
to
me
to
have
you
near
me
i
do
know
my
lady
i
can
scarcely
hope
so
but
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
it
was
so
it
is
so
little
one
the
pretty
face
is
checked
in
its
flush
of
pleasure
by
the
dark
expression
on
the
handsome
face
before
it
it
looks
timidly
for
an
explanation
and
if
i
were
to
say
leave
me
i
should
say
what
would
give
me
great
pain
and
disquiet
child
and
what
would
leave
me
very
solitary
my
lady
have
i
offended
you
in
nothing
come
here
rosa
bends
down
on
the
footstool
at
my
lady
feet
my
lady
with
that
motherly
touch
of
the
famous
ironmaster
night
lays
her
hand
upon
her
dark
hair
and
gently
keeps
it
there
i
told
you
rosa
that
i
wished
you
to
be
happy
and
that
i
would
make
you
so
if
i
could
make
anybody
happy
on
this
earth
i
can
not
there
are
reasons
now
known
to
me
reasons
in
which
you
have
no
part
rendering
it
far
better
for
you
that
you
should
not
remain
here
you
must
not
remain
here
i
have
determined
that
you
shall
not
i
have
written
to
the
father
of
your
lover
and
he
will
be
here
all
this
i
have
done
for
your
sake
the
weeping
girl
covers
her
hand
with
kisses
and
says
what
shall
she
do
what
shall
she
do
when
they
are
separated
her
mistress
kisses
her
on
the
cheek
and
makes
no
other
answer
now
be
happy
child
under
better
circumstances
be
beloved
and
happy
ah
my
lady
i
have
sometimes
thought
forgive
my
being
so
free
that
you
are
not
happy
i
will
you
be
more
so
when
you
have
sent
me
away
pray
pray
think
again
let
me
stay
a
little
while
i
have
said
my
child
that
what
i
do
i
do
for
your
sake
not
my
own
it
is
done
what
i
am
towards
you
rosa
is
what
i
am
now
not
what
i
shall
be
a
little
while
hence
remember
this
and
keep
my
confidence
do
so
much
for
my
sake
and
thus
all
ends
between
us
she
detaches
herself
from
her
companion
and
leaves
the
room
late
in
the
afternoon
when
she
next
appears
upon
the
staircase
she
is
in
her
haughtiest
and
coldest
state
as
indifferent
as
if
all
passion
feeling
and
interest
had
been
worn
out
in
the
earlier
ages
of
the
world
and
had
perished
from
its
surface
with
its
other
departed
monsters
mercury
has
announced
rouncewell
which
is
the
cause
of
her
appearance
rouncewell
is
not
in
the
library
but
she
repairs
to
the
library
sir
leicester
is
there
and
she
wishes
to
speak
to
him
first
sir
leicester
i
am
desirous
but
you
are
engaged
oh
dear
no
not
at
all
only
tulkinghorn
always
at
hand
haunting
every
place
no
relief
or
security
from
him
for
a
moment
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
dedlock
will
you
allow
me
to
retire
with
a
look
that
plainly
says
you
know
you
have
the
power
to
remain
if
you
will
she
tells
him
it
is
not
necessary
and
moves
towards
a
chair
tulkinghorn
brings
it
a
little
forward
for
her
with
his
clumsy
bow
and
retires
into
a
window
opposite
interposed
between
her
and
the
fading
light
of
day
in
the
now
quiet
street
his
shadow
falls
upon
her
and
he
darkens
all
before
her
even
so
does
he
darken
her
life
it
is
a
dull
street
under
the
best
conditions
where
the
two
long
rows
of
houses
stare
at
each
other
with
that
severity
that
of
its
greatest
mansions
seem
to
have
been
slowly
stared
into
stone
rather
than
originally
built
in
that
material
it
is
a
street
of
such
dismal
grandeur
so
determined
not
to
condescend
to
liveliness
that
the
doors
and
windows
hold
a
gloomy
state
of
their
own
in
black
paint
and
dust
and
the
echoing
mews
behind
have
a
dry
and
massive
appearance
as
if
they
were
reserved
to
stable
the
stone
chargers
of
noble
statues
complicated
garnish
of
entwines
itself
over
the
flights
of
steps
in
this
awful
street
and
from
these
petrified
bowers
extinguishers
for
obsolete
flambeaux
gasp
at
the
upstart
gas
here
and
there
a
weak
little
iron
hoop
through
which
bold
boys
aspire
to
throw
their
friends
caps
its
only
present
use
retains
its
place
among
the
rusty
foliage
sacred
to
the
memory
of
departed
oil
nay
even
oil
itself
yet
lingering
at
long
intervals
in
a
little
absurd
glass
pot
with
a
knob
in
the
bottom
like
an
oyster
blinks
and
sulks
at
newer
lights
every
night
like
its
high
and
dry
master
in
the
house
of
lords
therefore
there
is
not
much
that
lady
dedlock
seated
in
her
chair
could
wish
to
see
through
the
window
in
which
tulkinghorn
stands
and
yet
and
yet
she
sends
a
look
in
that
direction
as
if
it
were
her
heart
desire
to
have
that
figure
moved
out
of
the
way
sir
leicester
begs
his
lady
pardon
she
was
about
to
say
only
that
rouncewell
is
here
he
has
called
by
my
appointment
and
that
we
had
better
make
an
end
of
the
question
of
that
girl
i
am
tired
to
death
of
the
matter
what
can
i
do
to
assist
demands
sir
leicester
in
some
considerable
doubt
let
us
see
him
here
and
have
done
with
it
will
you
tell
them
to
send
him
up
tulkinghorn
be
so
good
as
to
ring
thank
you
request
says
sir
leicester
to
mercury
not
immediately
remembering
the
business
term
request
the
iron
gentleman
to
walk
this
way
mercury
departs
in
search
of
the
iron
gentleman
finds
and
produces
him
sir
leicester
receives
that
ferruginous
person
graciously
i
hope
you
are
well
rouncewell
be
seated
my
solicitor
mr
tulkinghorn
my
lady
was
desirous
rouncewell
sir
leicester
skilfully
transfers
him
with
a
solemn
wave
of
his
hand
was
desirous
to
speak
with
you
hem
i
shall
be
very
happy
returns
the
iron
gentleman
to
give
my
best
attention
to
anything
lady
dedlock
does
me
the
honour
to
say
as
he
turns
towards
her
he
finds
that
the
impression
she
makes
upon
him
is
less
agreeable
than
on
the
former
occasion
a
distant
supercilious
air
makes
a
cold
atmosphere
about
her
and
there
is
nothing
in
her
bearing
as
there
was
before
to
encourage
openness
pray
sir
says
lady
dedlock
listlessly
may
i
be
allowed
to
inquire
whether
anything
has
passed
between
you
and
your
son
respecting
your
son
fancy
it
is
almost
too
troublesome
to
her
languid
eyes
to
bestow
a
look
upon
him
as
she
asks
this
question
if
my
memory
serves
me
lady
dedlock
i
said
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
that
i
should
seriously
advise
my
son
to
conquer
that
fancy
the
ironmaster
repeats
her
expression
with
a
little
emphasis
and
did
you
oh
of
course
i
did
sir
leicester
gives
a
nod
approving
and
confirmatory
very
proper
the
iron
gentleman
having
said
that
he
would
do
it
was
bound
to
do
it
no
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
base
metals
and
the
precious
highly
proper
and
pray
has
he
done
so
really
lady
dedlock
i
can
not
make
you
a
definite
reply
i
fear
not
probably
not
yet
in
our
condition
of
life
we
sometimes
couple
an
intention
with
our
our
fancies
which
renders
them
not
altogether
easy
to
throw
off
i
think
it
is
rather
our
way
to
be
in
earnest
sir
leicester
has
a
misgiving
that
there
may
be
a
hidden
wat
tylerish
meaning
in
this
expression
and
fumes
a
little
rouncewell
is
perfectly
and
polite
but
within
such
limits
evidently
adapts
his
tone
to
his
reception
because
proceeds
my
lady
i
have
been
thinking
of
the
subject
which
is
tiresome
to
me
i
am
very
sorry
i
am
sure
and
also
of
what
sir
leicester
said
upon
it
in
which
i
quite
concur
sir
leicester
flattered
and
if
you
can
not
give
us
the
assurance
that
this
fancy
is
at
an
end
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
girl
had
better
leave
me
i
can
give
no
such
assurance
lady
dedlock
nothing
of
the
kind
then
she
had
better
go
excuse
me
my
lady
sir
leicester
considerately
interposes
but
perhaps
this
may
be
doing
an
injury
to
the
young
woman
which
she
has
not
merited
here
is
a
young
woman
says
sir
leicester
magnificently
laying
out
the
matter
with
his
right
hand
like
a
service
of
plate
whose
good
fortune
it
is
to
have
attracted
the
notice
and
favour
of
an
eminent
lady
and
to
live
under
the
protection
of
that
eminent
lady
surrounded
by
the
various
advantages
which
such
a
position
confers
and
which
are
unquestionably
very
great
i
believe
unquestionably
very
great
sir
for
a
young
woman
in
that
station
of
life
the
question
then
arises
should
that
young
woman
be
deprived
of
these
many
advantages
and
that
good
fortune
simply
because
she
has
sir
leicester
with
an
apologetic
but
dignified
inclination
of
his
head
towards
the
ironmaster
winds
up
his
sentence
has
attracted
the
notice
of
mr
rouncewell
son
now
has
she
deserved
this
punishment
is
this
just
towards
her
is
this
our
previous
understanding
i
beg
your
pardon
interposes
rouncewell
son
father
sir
leicester
will
you
allow
me
i
think
i
may
shorten
the
subject
pray
dismiss
that
from
your
consideration
if
you
remember
anything
so
unimportant
which
is
not
to
be
expected
you
would
recollect
that
my
first
thought
in
the
affair
was
directly
opposed
to
her
remaining
here
dismiss
the
dedlock
patronage
from
consideration
oh
sir
leicester
is
bound
to
believe
a
pair
of
ears
that
have
been
handed
down
to
him
through
such
a
family
or
he
really
might
have
mistrusted
their
report
of
the
iron
gentleman
observations
it
is
not
necessary
observes
my
lady
in
her
coldest
manner
before
he
can
do
anything
but
breathe
amazedly
to
enter
into
these
matters
on
either
side
the
girl
is
a
very
good
girl
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
against
her
but
she
is
so
far
insensible
to
her
many
advantages
and
her
good
fortune
that
she
is
in
love
or
supposes
she
is
poor
little
fool
and
unable
to
appreciate
them
sir
leicester
begs
to
observe
that
wholly
alters
the
case
he
might
have
been
sure
that
my
lady
had
the
best
grounds
and
reasons
in
support
of
her
view
he
entirely
agrees
with
my
lady
the
young
woman
had
better
go
as
sir
leicester
observed
rouncewell
on
the
last
occasion
when
we
were
fatigued
by
this
business
lady
dedlock
languidly
proceeds
we
can
not
make
conditions
with
you
without
conditions
and
under
present
circumstances
the
girl
is
quite
misplaced
here
and
had
better
go
i
have
told
her
so
would
you
wish
to
have
her
sent
back
to
the
village
or
would
you
like
to
take
her
with
you
or
what
would
you
prefer
lady
dedlock
if
i
may
speak
plainly
by
all
means
i
should
prefer
the
course
which
will
the
soonest
relieve
you
of
the
incumbrance
and
remove
her
from
her
present
position
and
to
speak
as
plainly
she
returns
with
the
same
studied
carelessness
so
should
i
do
i
understand
that
you
will
take
her
with
you
the
iron
gentleman
makes
an
iron
bow
sir
leicester
will
you
ring
tulkinghorn
steps
forward
from
his
window
and
pulls
the
bell
i
had
forgotten
you
thank
you
he
makes
his
usual
bow
and
goes
quietly
back
again
mercury
appears
receives
instructions
whom
to
produce
skims
away
produces
the
aforesaid
and
departs
rosa
has
been
crying
and
is
yet
in
distress
on
her
coming
in
the
ironmaster
leaves
his
chair
takes
her
arm
in
his
and
remains
with
her
near
the
door
ready
to
depart
you
are
taken
charge
of
you
see
says
my
lady
in
her
weary
manner
and
are
going
away
well
protected
i
have
mentioned
that
you
are
a
very
good
girl
and
you
have
nothing
to
cry
for
she
seems
after
all
observes
tulkinghorn
loitering
a
little
forward
with
his
hands
behind
him
as
if
she
were
crying
at
going
away
why
she
is
not
you
see
returns
rouncewell
with
some
quickness
in
his
manner
as
if
he
were
glad
to
have
the
lawyer
to
retort
upon
and
she
is
an
inexperienced
little
thing
and
knows
no
better
if
she
had
remained
here
sir
she
would
have
improved
no
doubt
no
doubt
is
tulkinghorn
composed
reply
rosa
sobs
out
that
she
is
very
sorry
to
leave
my
lady
and
that
she
was
happy
at
chesney
wold
and
has
been
happy
with
my
lady
and
that
she
thanks
my
lady
over
and
over
again
out
you
silly
little
puss
says
the
ironmaster
checking
her
in
a
low
voice
though
not
angrily
have
a
spirit
if
you
fond
of
watt
my
lady
merely
waves
her
off
with
indifference
saying
there
there
child
you
are
a
good
girl
go
away
sir
leicester
has
magnificently
disengaged
himself
from
the
subject
and
retired
into
the
sanctuary
of
his
blue
coat
tulkinghorn
an
indistinct
form
against
the
dark
street
now
dotted
with
lamps
looms
in
my
lady
view
bigger
and
blacker
than
before
sir
leicester
and
lady
dedlock
says
rouncewell
after
a
pause
of
a
few
moments
i
beg
to
take
my
leave
with
an
apology
for
having
again
troubled
you
though
not
of
my
own
act
on
this
tiresome
subject
i
can
very
well
understand
i
assure
you
how
tiresome
so
small
a
matter
must
have
become
to
lady
dedlock
if
i
am
doubtful
of
my
dealing
with
it
it
is
only
because
i
did
not
at
first
quietly
exert
my
influence
to
take
my
young
friend
here
away
without
troubling
you
at
all
but
it
appeared
to
me
i
dare
say
magnifying
the
importance
of
the
thing
that
it
was
respectful
to
explain
to
you
how
the
matter
stood
and
candid
to
consult
your
wishes
and
convenience
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
want
of
acquaintance
with
the
polite
world
sir
leicester
considers
himself
evoked
out
of
the
sanctuary
by
these
remarks
rouncewell
he
returns
do
not
mention
it
justifications
are
unnecessary
i
hope
on
either
side
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
sir
leicester
and
if
i
may
by
way
of
a
last
word
revert
to
what
i
said
before
of
my
mother
long
connexion
with
the
family
and
the
worth
it
bespeaks
on
both
sides
i
would
point
out
this
little
instance
here
on
my
arm
who
shows
herself
so
affectionate
and
faithful
in
parting
and
in
whom
my
mother
i
dare
say
has
done
something
to
awaken
such
feelings
though
of
course
lady
dedlock
by
her
heartfelt
interest
and
her
genial
condescension
has
done
much
more
if
he
mean
this
ironically
it
may
be
truer
than
he
thinks
he
points
it
however
by
no
deviation
from
his
straightforward
manner
of
speech
though
in
saying
it
he
turns
towards
that
part
of
the
dim
room
where
my
lady
sits
sir
leicester
stands
to
return
his
parting
salutation
tulkinghorn
again
rings
mercury
takes
another
flight
and
rouncewell
and
rosa
leave
the
house
then
lights
are
brought
in
discovering
tulkinghorn
still
standing
in
his
window
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
my
lady
still
sitting
with
his
figure
before
her
closing
up
her
view
of
the
night
as
well
as
of
the
day
she
is
very
pale
tulkinghorn
observing
it
as
she
rises
to
retire
thinks
well
she
may
be
the
power
of
this
woman
is
astonishing
she
has
been
acting
a
part
the
whole
time
but
he
can
act
a
part
too
his
one
unchanging
character
and
as
he
holds
the
door
open
for
this
woman
fifty
pairs
of
eyes
each
fifty
times
sharper
than
sir
leicester
pair
should
find
no
flaw
in
him
lady
dedlock
dines
alone
in
her
own
room
sir
leicester
is
whipped
in
to
the
rescue
of
the
doodle
party
and
the
discomfiture
of
the
coodle
faction
lady
dedlock
asks
on
sitting
down
to
dinner
still
deadly
pale
and
quite
an
illustration
of
the
debilitated
cousin
text
whether
he
is
gone
out
yes
whether
tulkinghorn
is
gone
yet
no
presently
she
asks
again
is
he
gone
yet
no
what
is
he
doing
mercury
thinks
he
is
writing
letters
in
the
library
would
my
lady
wish
to
see
him
anything
but
that
but
he
wishes
to
see
my
lady
within
a
few
more
minutes
he
is
reported
as
sending
his
respects
and
could
my
lady
please
to
receive
him
for
a
word
or
two
after
her
dinner
my
lady
will
receive
him
now
he
comes
now
apologizing
for
intruding
even
by
her
permission
while
she
is
at
table
when
they
are
alone
my
lady
waves
her
hand
to
dispense
with
such
mockeries
what
do
you
want
sir
why
lady
dedlock
says
the
lawyer
taking
a
chair
at
a
little
distance
from
her
and
slowly
rubbing
his
rusty
legs
up
and
down
up
and
down
up
and
down
i
am
rather
surprised
by
the
course
you
have
taken
indeed
yes
decidedly
i
was
not
prepared
for
it
i
consider
it
a
departure
from
our
agreement
and
your
promise
it
puts
us
in
a
new
position
lady
dedlock
i
feel
myself
under
the
necessity
of
saying
that
i
do
approve
of
it
he
stops
in
his
rubbing
and
looks
at
her
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
imperturbable
and
unchangeable
as
he
is
there
is
still
an
indefinable
freedom
in
his
manner
which
is
new
and
which
does
not
escape
this
woman
observation
i
do
not
quite
understand
you
oh
yes
you
do
i
think
i
think
you
do
come
come
lady
dedlock
we
must
not
fence
and
parry
now
you
know
you
like
this
girl
well
sir
and
you
know
and
i
know
that
you
have
not
sent
her
away
for
the
reasons
you
have
assigned
but
for
the
purpose
of
separating
her
as
much
as
possible
from
excuse
my
mentioning
it
as
a
matter
of
business
any
reproach
and
exposure
that
impend
over
yourself
well
sir
well
lady
dedlock
returns
the
lawyer
crossing
his
legs
and
nursing
the
uppermost
knee
i
object
to
that
i
consider
that
a
dangerous
proceeding
i
know
it
to
be
unnecessary
and
calculated
to
awaken
speculation
doubt
rumour
i
do
know
what
in
the
house
besides
it
is
a
violation
of
our
agreement
you
were
to
be
exactly
what
you
were
before
whereas
it
must
be
evident
to
yourself
as
it
is
to
me
that
you
have
been
this
evening
very
different
from
what
you
were
before
why
bless
my
soul
lady
dedlock
transparently
so
if
sir
she
begins
in
my
knowledge
of
my
secret
but
he
interrupts
her
now
lady
dedlock
this
is
a
matter
of
business
and
in
a
matter
of
business
the
ground
can
not
be
kept
too
clear
it
is
no
longer
your
secret
excuse
me
that
is
just
the
mistake
it
is
my
secret
in
trust
for
sir
leicester
and
the
family
if
it
were
your
secret
lady
dedlock
we
should
not
be
here
holding
this
conversation
that
is
very
true
if
in
my
knowledge
of
the
secret
i
do
what
i
can
to
spare
an
innocent
girl
especially
remembering
your
own
reference
to
her
when
you
told
my
story
to
the
assembled
guests
at
chesney
wold
from
the
taint
of
my
impending
shame
i
act
upon
a
resolution
i
have
taken
nothing
in
the
world
and
no
one
in
the
world
could
shake
it
or
could
move
me
this
she
says
with
great
deliberation
and
distinctness
and
with
no
more
outward
passion
than
himself
as
for
him
he
methodically
discusses
his
matter
of
business
as
if
she
were
any
insensible
instrument
used
in
business
really
then
you
see
lady
dedlock
he
returns
you
are
not
to
be
trusted
you
have
put
the
case
in
a
perfectly
plain
way
and
according
to
the
literal
fact
and
that
being
the
case
you
are
not
to
be
trusted
perhaps
you
may
remember
that
i
expressed
some
anxiety
on
this
same
point
when
we
spoke
at
night
at
chesney
wold
yes
says
tulkinghorn
coolly
getting
up
and
standing
on
the
hearth
yes
i
recollect
lady
dedlock
that
you
certainly
referred
to
the
girl
but
that
was
before
we
came
to
our
arrangement
and
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
our
arrangement
altogether
precluded
any
action
on
your
part
founded
upon
my
discovery
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
that
as
to
sparing
the
girl
of
what
importance
or
value
is
she
spare
lady
dedlock
here
is
a
family
name
compromised
one
might
have
supposed
that
the
course
was
straight
on
over
everything
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
regardless
of
all
considerations
in
the
way
sparing
nothing
treading
everything
under
foot
she
has
been
looking
at
the
table
she
lifts
up
her
eyes
and
looks
at
him
there
is
a
stern
expression
on
her
face
and
a
part
of
her
lower
lip
is
compressed
under
her
teeth
this
woman
understands
me
tulkinghorn
thinks
as
she
lets
her
glance
fall
again
she
can
not
be
spared
why
should
she
spare
others
for
a
little
while
they
are
silent
lady
dedlock
has
eaten
no
dinner
but
has
twice
or
thrice
poured
out
water
with
a
steady
hand
and
drunk
it
she
rises
from
table
takes
a
and
reclines
in
it
shading
her
face
there
is
nothing
in
her
manner
to
express
weakness
or
excite
compassion
it
is
thoughtful
gloomy
concentrated
this
woman
thinks
tulkinghorn
standing
on
the
hearth
again
a
dark
object
closing
up
her
view
is
a
study
he
studies
her
at
his
leisure
not
speaking
for
a
time
she
too
studies
something
at
her
leisure
she
is
not
the
first
to
speak
appearing
indeed
so
unlikely
to
be
so
though
he
stood
there
until
midnight
that
even
he
is
driven
upon
breaking
silence
lady
dedlock
the
most
disagreeable
part
of
this
business
interview
remains
but
it
is
business
our
agreement
is
broken
a
lady
of
your
sense
and
strength
of
character
will
be
prepared
for
my
now
declaring
it
void
and
taking
my
own
course
i
am
quite
prepared
tulkinghorn
inclines
his
head
that
is
all
i
have
to
trouble
you
with
lady
dedlock
she
stops
him
as
he
is
moving
out
of
the
room
by
asking
this
is
the
notice
i
was
to
receive
i
wish
not
to
misapprehend
you
not
exactly
the
notice
you
were
to
receive
lady
dedlock
because
the
contemplated
notice
supposed
the
agreement
to
have
been
observed
but
virtually
the
same
virtually
the
same
the
difference
is
merely
in
a
lawyer
mind
you
intend
to
give
me
no
other
notice
you
are
right
no
do
you
contemplate
undeceiving
sir
leicester
a
home
question
says
tulkinghorn
with
a
slight
smile
and
cautiously
shaking
his
head
at
the
shaded
face
no
not
all
things
considered
i
had
better
decline
answering
that
question
lady
dedlock
if
i
were
to
say
i
do
know
when
exactly
you
would
not
believe
me
and
it
would
answer
no
purpose
it
may
be
i
would
rather
say
no
more
you
are
prepared
and
i
hold
out
no
expectations
which
circumstances
might
fail
to
justify
i
wish
you
good
evening
she
removes
her
hand
turns
her
pale
face
towards
him
as
he
walks
silently
to
the
door
and
stops
him
once
again
as
he
is
about
to
open
it
do
you
intend
to
remain
in
the
house
any
time
i
heard
you
were
writing
in
the
library
are
you
going
to
return
there
only
for
my
hat
i
am
going
home
she
bows
her
eyes
rather
than
her
head
the
movement
is
so
slight
and
curious
and
he
withdraws
clear
of
the
room
he
looks
at
his
watch
but
is
inclined
to
doubt
it
by
a
minute
or
thereabouts
there
is
a
splendid
clock
upon
the
staircase
famous
as
splendid
clocks
not
often
are
for
its
accuracy
and
what
do
you
say
tulkinghorn
inquires
referring
to
it
what
do
you
say
if
it
said
now
do
go
home
what
a
famous
clock
hereafter
if
it
said
of
all
the
nights
that
it
has
counted
off
to
this
old
man
of
all
the
young
and
old
men
who
have
ever
stood
before
it
do
go
home
with
its
sharp
clear
bell
it
strikes
three
quarters
after
seven
and
ticks
on
again
why
you
are
worse
than
i
thought
you
says
tulkinghorn
muttering
reproof
to
his
watch
two
minutes
wrong
at
this
rate
you
wo
last
my
time
what
a
watch
to
return
good
for
evil
if
it
ticked
in
answer
do
go
home
he
passes
out
into
the
streets
and
walks
on
with
his
hands
behind
him
under
the
shadow
of
the
lofty
houses
many
of
whose
mysteries
difficulties
mortgages
delicate
affairs
of
all
kinds
are
treasured
up
within
his
old
black
satin
waistcoat
he
is
in
the
confidence
of
the
very
bricks
and
mortar
the
high
telegraph
family
secrets
to
him
yet
there
is
not
a
voice
in
a
mile
of
them
to
whisper
do
go
home
through
the
stir
and
motion
of
the
commoner
streets
through
the
roar
and
jar
of
many
vehicles
many
feet
many
voices
with
the
blazing
lighting
him
on
the
west
wind
blowing
him
on
and
the
crowd
pressing
him
on
he
is
pitilessly
urged
upon
his
way
and
nothing
meets
him
murmuring
do
go
home
arrived
at
last
in
his
dull
room
to
light
his
candles
and
look
round
and
up
and
see
the
roman
pointing
from
the
ceiling
there
is
no
new
significance
in
the
roman
hand
or
in
the
flutter
of
the
attendant
groups
to
give
him
the
late
warning
do
come
here
it
is
a
moonlight
night
but
the
moon
being
past
the
full
is
only
now
rising
over
the
great
wilderness
of
london
the
stars
are
shining
as
they
shone
above
the
at
chesney
wold
this
woman
as
he
has
of
late
been
so
accustomed
to
call
her
looks
out
upon
them
her
soul
is
turbulent
within
her
she
is
sick
at
heart
and
restless
the
large
rooms
are
too
cramped
and
close
she
can
not
endure
their
restraint
and
will
walk
alone
in
a
neighbouring
garden
too
capricious
and
imperious
in
all
she
does
to
be
the
cause
of
much
surprise
in
those
about
her
as
to
anything
she
does
this
woman
loosely
muffled
goes
out
into
the
moonlight
mercury
attends
with
the
key
having
opened
the
he
delivers
the
key
into
his
lady
hands
at
her
request
and
is
bidden
to
go
back
she
will
walk
there
some
time
to
ease
her
aching
head
she
may
be
an
hour
she
may
be
more
she
needs
no
further
escort
the
gate
shuts
upon
its
spring
with
a
clash
and
he
leaves
her
passing
on
into
the
dark
shade
of
some
trees
a
fine
night
and
a
bright
large
moon
and
multitudes
of
stars
tulkinghorn
in
repairing
to
his
cellar
and
in
opening
and
shutting
those
resounding
doors
has
to
cross
a
little
yard
he
looks
up
casually
thinking
what
a
fine
night
what
a
bright
large
moon
what
multitudes
of
stars
a
quiet
night
too
a
very
quiet
night
when
the
moon
shines
very
brilliantly
a
solitude
and
stillness
seem
to
proceed
from
her
that
influence
even
crowded
places
full
of
life
not
only
is
it
a
still
night
on
dusty
high
roads
and
on
whence
a
wide
expanse
of
country
may
be
seen
in
repose
quieter
and
quieter
as
it
spreads
away
into
a
fringe
of
trees
against
the
sky
with
the
grey
ghost
of
a
bloom
upon
them
not
only
is
it
a
still
night
in
gardens
and
in
woods
and
on
the
river
where
the
are
fresh
and
green
and
the
stream
sparkles
on
among
pleasant
islands
murmuring
weirs
and
whispering
rushes
not
only
does
the
stillness
attend
it
as
it
flows
where
houses
cluster
thick
where
many
bridges
are
reflected
in
it
where
wharves
and
shipping
make
it
black
and
awful
where
it
winds
from
these
disfigurements
through
marshes
whose
grim
beacons
stand
like
skeletons
washed
ashore
where
it
expands
through
the
bolder
region
of
rising
grounds
rich
in
cornfield
and
steeple
and
where
it
mingles
with
the
sea
not
only
is
it
a
still
night
on
the
deep
and
on
the
shore
where
the
watcher
stands
to
see
the
ship
with
her
spread
wings
cross
the
path
of
light
that
appears
to
be
presented
to
only
him
but
even
on
this
stranger
wilderness
of
london
there
is
some
rest
its
steeples
and
towers
and
its
one
great
dome
grow
more
ethereal
its
smoky
lose
their
grossness
in
the
pale
effulgence
the
noises
that
arise
from
the
streets
are
fewer
and
are
softened
and
the
footsteps
on
the
pavements
pass
more
tranquilly
away
in
these
fields
of
tulkinghorn
inhabiting
where
the
shepherds
play
on
chancery
pipes
that
have
no
stop
and
keep
their
sheep
in
the
fold
by
hook
and
by
crook
until
they
have
shorn
them
exceeding
close
every
noise
is
merged
this
moonlight
night
into
a
distant
ringing
hum
as
if
the
city
were
a
vast
glass
vibrating
what
that
who
fired
a
gun
or
pistol
where
was
it
the
few
start
stop
and
stare
about
them
some
windows
and
doors
are
opened
and
people
come
out
to
look
it
was
a
loud
report
and
echoed
and
rattled
heavily
it
shook
one
house
or
so
a
man
says
who
was
passing
it
has
aroused
all
the
dogs
in
the
neighbourhood
who
bark
vehemently
terrified
cats
scamper
across
the
road
while
the
dogs
are
yet
barking
and
howling
there
is
one
dog
howling
like
a
demon
the
as
if
they
were
startled
too
begin
to
strike
the
hum
from
the
streets
likewise
seems
to
swell
into
a
shout
but
it
is
soon
over
before
the
last
clock
begins
to
strike
ten
there
is
a
lull
when
it
has
ceased
the
fine
night
the
bright
large
moon
and
multitudes
of
stars
are
left
at
peace
again
has
tulkinghorn
been
disturbed
his
windows
are
dark
and
quiet
and
his
door
is
shut
it
must
be
something
unusual
indeed
to
bring
him
out
of

nothing
is

of
him
nothing
is

of
him
what
power
of
cannon
might
it
take
to
shake
that
rusty
old
man
out
of
his
immovable
composure
for
many
years
the
persistent
roman
has
been
pointing
with
no
particular
meaning
from
that
ceiling
it
is
not
likely
that
he
has
any
new
meaning
in
him
once
pointing
always
pointing
like
any
roman
or
even
briton
with
a
single
idea
there
he
is
no
doubt
in
his
impossible
attitude
pointing
unavailingly
all
night
long
moonlight
darkness
dawn
sunrise
day
there
he
is
still
eagerly
pointing
and
no
one
minds
him
but
a
little
after
the
coming
of
the
day
come
people
to
clean
the
rooms
and
either
the
roman
has
some
new
meaning
in
him
not
expressed
before
or
the
foremost
of
them
goes
wild
for
looking
up
at
his
outstretched
hand
and
looking
down
at
what
is
below
it
that
person
shrieks
and
flies
the
others
looking
in
as
the
first
one
looked
shriek
and
fly
too
and
there
is
an
alarm
in
the
street
what
does
it
mean
no
light
is
admitted
into
the
darkened
chamber
and
people
unaccustomed
to
it
enter
and
treading
softly
but
heavily
carry
a

into

and
lay

strict
search
of

corner
careful
tracing
of
steps
and
careful
noting
of
the
disposition
of
every
article
of
furniture
all
eyes
look
up
at
the
roman
and
all
voices
murmur
if
he
could
only
tell
what
he
saw
he
is
pointing
at
a
table
with
a
bottle
nearly
full
of
wine
and
a
glass
upon
it
and
two
candles
that
were
blown
out
suddenly
soon
after
being
lighted
he
is
pointing
at
an
empty
chair
and
at
a
stain
upon
the
ground
before
it
that
might
be
almost
covered
with
a
hand
these
objects
lie
directly
within
his
range
an
excited
imagination
might
suppose
that
there
was
something
in
them
so
terrific
as
to
drive
the
rest
of
the
composition
not
only
the
attendant
boys
but
the
clouds
and
flowers
and
pillars
too
in
short
the
very
body
and
soul
of
allegory
and
all
the
brains
it
has
stark
mad
it
happens
surely
that
every
one
who
comes
into
the
darkened
room
and
looks
at
these
things
looks
up
at
the
roman
and
that
he
is
invested
in
all
eyes
with
mystery
and
awe
as
if
he
were
a
paralysed
dumb
witness
so
it
shall
happen
surely
through
many
years
to
come
that
ghostly
stories
shall
be
told
of
the
stain
upon
the
floor
so
easy
to
be
covered
so
hard
to
be
got
out
and
that
the
roman
pointing
from
the
ceiling
shall
point
so
long
as
dust
and
damp
and
spiders
spare
him
with
far
greater
significance
than
he
ever
had
in
time
and
with
a
deadly
meaning
for
tulkinghorn
time
is
over
for
evermore
and
the
roman
pointed
at
the
murderous
hand
uplifted
against
his
life
and
pointed
helplessly
at
him
from
night
to
morning
lying
face
downward
on
the
floor

heart
chapter
xlix
dutiful
friendship
a
great
annual
occasion
has
come
round
in
the
establishment
of
matthew
bagnet
otherwise
lignum
vitae
and
present
an
occasion
of
feasting
and
festival
the
celebration
of
a
birthday
in
the
family
it
is
not
bagnet
birthday
bagnet
merely
distinguishes
that
epoch
in
the
musical
instrument
business
by
kissing
the
children
with
an
extra
smack
before
breakfast
smoking
an
additional
pipe
after
dinner
and
wondering
towards
evening
what
his
poor
old
mother
is
thinking
about
it
a
subject
of
infinite
speculation
and
rendered
so
by
his
mother
having
departed
this
life
twenty
years
some
men
rarely
revert
to
their
father
but
seem
in
the
of
their
remembrance
to
have
transferred
all
the
stock
of
filial
affection
into
their
mother
name
bagnet
is
one
of
these
perhaps
his
exalted
appreciation
of
the
merits
of
the
old
girl
causes
him
usually
to
make
the
goodness
of
the
feminine
gender
it
is
not
the
birthday
of
one
of
the
three
children
those
occasions
are
kept
with
some
marks
of
distinction
but
they
rarely
overleap
the
bounds
of
happy
returns
and
a
pudding
on
young
woolwich
last
birthday
bagnet
certainly
did
after
observing
on
his
growth
and
general
advancement
proceed
in
a
moment
of
profound
reflection
on
the
changes
wrought
by
time
to
examine
him
in
the
catechism
accomplishing
with
extreme
accuracy
the
questions
number
one
and
two
what
is
your
name
and
who
gave
you
that
name
but
there
failing
in
the
exact
precision
of
his
memory
and
substituting
for
number
three
the
question
and
how
do
you
like
that
name
which
he
propounded
with
a
sense
of
its
importance
in
itself
so
edifying
and
improving
as
to
give
it
quite
an
orthodox
air
this
however
was
a
speciality
on
that
particular
birthday
and
not
a
general
solemnity
it
is
the
old
girl
birthday
and
that
is
the
greatest
holiday
and
day
in
bagnet
calendar
the
auspicious
event
is
always
commemorated
according
to
certain
forms
settled
and
prescribed
by
bagnet
some
years
since
bagnet
being
deeply
convinced
that
to
have
a
pair
of
fowls
for
dinner
is
to
attain
the
highest
pitch
of
imperial
luxury
invariably
goes
forth
himself
very
early
in
the
morning
of
this
day
to
buy
a
pair
he
is
as
invariably
taken
in
by
the
vendor
and
installed
in
the
possession
of
the
oldest
inhabitants
of
any
coop
in
europe
returning
with
these
triumphs
of
toughness
tied
up
in
a
clean
blue
and
white
cotton
handkerchief
essential
to
the
arrangements
he
in
a
casual
manner
invites
bagnet
to
declare
at
breakfast
what
she
would
like
for
dinner
bagnet
by
a
coincidence
never
known
to
fail
replying
fowls
bagnet
instantly
produces
his
bundle
from
a
place
of
concealment
amidst
general
amazement
and
rejoicing
he
further
requires
that
the
old
girl
shall
do
nothing
all
day
long
but
sit
in
her
very
best
gown
and
be
served
by
himself
and
the
young
people
as
he
is
not
illustrious
for
his
cookery
this
may
be
supposed
to
be
a
matter
of
state
rather
than
enjoyment
on
the
old
girl
part
but
she
keeps
her
state
with
all
imaginable
cheerfulness
on
this
present
birthday
bagnet
has
accomplished
the
usual
preliminaries
he
has
bought
two
specimens
of
poultry
which
if
there
be
any
truth
in
adages
were
certainly
not
caught
with
chaff
to
be
prepared
for
the
spit
he
has
amazed
and
rejoiced
the
family
by
their
production
he
is
himself
directing
the
roasting
of
the
poultry
and
bagnet
with
her
wholesome
brown
fingers
itching
to
prevent
what
she
sees
going
wrong
sits
in
her
gown
of
ceremony
an
honoured
guest
quebec
and
malta
lay
the
cloth
for
dinner
while
woolwich
serving
as
beseems
him
under
his
father
keeps
the
fowls
revolving
to
these
young
scullions
bagnet
occasionally
imparts
a
wink
or
a
shake
of
the
head
or
a
crooked
face
as
they
made
mistakes
at
half
after
one
says
bagnet
to
the
minute
they
be
done
bagnet
with
anguish
beholds
one
of
them
at
a
standstill
before
the
fire
and
beginning
to
burn
you
shall
have
a
dinner
old
girl
says
bagnet
fit
for
a
queen
bagnet
shows
her
white
teeth
cheerfully
but
to
the
perception
of
her
son
betrays
so
much
uneasiness
of
spirit
that
he
is
impelled
by
the
dictates
of
affection
to
ask
her
with
his
eyes
what
is
the
matter
thus
standing
with
his
eyes
wide
open
more
oblivious
of
the
fowls
than
before
and
not
affording
the
least
hope
of
a
return
to
consciousness
fortunately
his
elder
sister
perceives
the
cause
of
the
agitation
in
bagnet
breast
and
with
an
admonitory
poke
recalls
him
the
stopped
fowls
going
round
again
bagnet
closes
her
eyes
in
the
intensity
of
her
relief
george
will
look
us
up
says
bagnet
at
half
after
four
to
the
moment
how
many
years
old
girl
has
george
looked
us
up
this
afternoon
ah
lignum
lignum
as
many
as
make
an
old
woman
of
a
young
one
i
begin
to
think
just
about
that
and
no
less
returns
bagnet
laughing
and
shaking
her
head
old
girl
says
bagnet
never
mind
you
be
as
young
as
ever
you
was
if
you
was
younger
which
you
are
as
everybody
knows
quebec
and
malta
here
exclaim
with
clapping
of
hands
that
bluffy
is
sure
to
bring
mother
something
and
begin
to
speculate
on
what
it
will
be
do
you
know
lignum
says
bagnet
casting
a
glance
on
the
and
winking
salt
at
malta
with
her
right
eye
and
shaking
the
pepper
away
from
quebec
with
her
head
i
begin
to
think
george
is
in
the
roving
way
again
george
returns
bagnet
will
never
desert
and
leave
his
old
comrade
in
the
lurch
do
be
afraid
of
it
no
lignum
no
i
do
say
he
will
i
do
think
he
will
but
if
he
could
get
over
this
money
trouble
of
his
i
believe
he
would
be
off
bagnet
asks
why
well
returns
his
wife
considering
george
seems
to
me
to
be
getting
not
a
little
impatient
and
restless
i
do
say
but
what
he
as
free
as
ever
of
course
he
must
be
free
or
he
would
be
george
but
he
smarts
and
seems
put
out
he
says
bagnet
by
a
lawyer
who
would
put
the
devil
out
there
something
in
that
his
wife
assents
but
so
it
is
lignum
further
conversation
is
prevented
for
the
time
by
the
necessity
under
which
bagnet
finds
himself
of
directing
the
whole
force
of
his
mind
to
the
dinner
which
is
a
little
endangered
by
the
dry
humour
of
the
fowls
in
not
yielding
any
gravy
and
also
by
the
made
gravy
acquiring
no
flavour
and
turning
out
of
a
flaxen
complexion
with
a
similar
perverseness
the
potatoes
crumble
off
forks
in
the
process
of
peeling
upheaving
from
their
centres
in
every
direction
as
if
they
were
subject
to
earthquakes
the
legs
of
the
fowls
too
are
longer
than
could
be
desired
and
extremely
scaly
overcoming
these
disadvantages
to
the
best
of
his
ability
bagnet
at
last
dishes
and
they
sit
down
at
table
bagnet
occupying
the
place
at
his
right
hand
it
is
well
for
the
old
girl
that
she
has
but
one
birthday
in
a
year
for
two
such
indulgences
in
poultry
might
be
injurious
every
kind
of
finer
tendon
and
ligament
that
is
in
the
nature
of
poultry
to
possess
is
developed
in
these
specimens
in
the
singular
form
of
their
limbs
appear
to
have
struck
roots
into
their
breasts
and
bodies
as
aged
trees
strike
roots
into
the
earth
their
legs
are
so
hard
as
to
encourage
the
idea
that
they
must
have
devoted
the
greater
part
of
their
long
and
arduous
lives
to
pedestrian
exercises
and
the
walking
of
matches
but
bagnet
unconscious
of
these
little
defects
sets
his
heart
on
bagnet
eating
a
most
severe
quantity
of
the
delicacies
before
her
and
as
that
good
old
girl
would
not
cause
him
a
moment
disappointment
on
any
day
least
of
all
on
such
a
day
for
any
consideration
she
imperils
her
digestion
fearfully
how
young
woolwich
cleans
the
without
being
of
ostrich
descent
his
anxious
mother
is
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
old
girl
has
another
trial
to
undergo
after
the
conclusion
of
the
repast
in
sitting
in
state
to
see
the
room
cleared
the
hearth
swept
and
the
washed
up
and
polished
in
the
backyard
the
great
delight
and
energy
with
which
the
two
young
ladies
apply
themselves
to
these
duties
turning
up
their
skirts
in
imitation
of
their
mother
and
skating
in
and
out
on
little
scaffolds
of
pattens
inspire
the
highest
hopes
for
the
future
but
some
anxiety
for
the
present
the
same
causes
lead
to
confusion
of
tongues
a
clattering
of
crockery
a
rattling
of
tin
mugs
a
whisking
of
brooms
and
an
expenditure
of
water
all
in
excess
while
the
saturation
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
is
almost
too
moving
a
spectacle
for
bagnet
to
look
upon
with
the
calmness
proper
to
her
position
at
last
the
various
cleansing
processes
are
triumphantly
completed
quebec
and
malta
appear
in
fresh
attire
smiling
and
dry
pipes
tobacco
and
something
to
drink
are
placed
upon
the
table
and
the
old
girl
enjoys
the
first
peace
of
mind
she
ever
knows
on
the
day
of
this
delightful
entertainment
when
bagnet
takes
his
usual
seat
the
hands
of
the
clock
are
very
near
to
four
as
they
mark
it
accurately
bagnet
announces
george
military
time
it
is
george
and
he
has
hearty
congratulations
for
the
old
girl
whom
he
kisses
on
the
great
occasion
and
for
the
children
and
for
bagnet
happy
returns
to
all
says
george
but
george
old
man
cries
bagnet
looking
at
him
curiously
what
come
to
you
come
to
me
ah
you
are
so
white
george
for
you
and
look
so
shocked
now
do
he
lignum
george
says
bagnet
tell
the
old
girl
what
the
matter
i
did
know
i
looked
white
says
the
trooper
passing
his
hand
over
his
brow
and
i
did
know
i
looked
shocked
and
i
sorry
i
do
but
the
truth
is
that
boy
who
was
taken
in
at
my
place
died
yesterday
afternoon
and
it
has
rather
knocked
me
over
poor
creetur
says
bagnet
with
a
mother
pity
is
he
gone
dear
dear
i
did
mean
to
say
anything
about
it
for
it
not
birthday
talk
but
you
have
got
it
out
of
me
you
see
before
i
sit
down
i
should
have
roused
up
in
a
minute
says
the
trooper
making
himself
speak
more
gaily
but
you
so
quick
mrs
bagnet
you
right
the
old
girl
says
bagnet
is
as
quick
as
powder
and
what
more
she
the
subject
of
the
day
and
we
stick
to
her
cries
george
see
here
i
have
brought
a
little
brooch
along
with
me
it
a
poor
thing
you
know
but
it
a
keepsake
that
all
the
good
it
is
mrs
bagnet
george
produces
his
present
which
is
greeted
with
admiring
leapings
and
clappings
by
the
young
family
and
with
a
species
of
reverential
admiration
by
bagnet
old
girl
says
bagnet
tell
him
my
opinion
of
it
why
it
a
wonder
george
bagnet
exclaims
it
the
beautifullest
thing
that
ever
was
seen
good
says
bagnet
my
opinion
it
so
pretty
george
cries
bagnet
turning
it
on
all
sides
and
holding
it
out
at
arm
length
that
it
seems
too
choice
for
me
bad
says
bagnet
not
my
opinion
but
whatever
it
is
a
hundred
thousand
thanks
old
fellow
says
bagnet
her
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
and
her
hand
stretched
out
to
him
and
though
i
have
been
a
crossgrained
soldier
wife
to
you
sometimes
george
we
are
as
strong
friends
i
am
sure
in
reality
as
ever
can
be
now
you
shall
fasten
it
on
yourself
for
good
luck
if
you
will
george
the
children
close
up
to
see
it
done
and
bagnet
looks
over
young
woolwich
head
to
see
it
done
with
an
interest
so
maturely
wooden
yet
pleasantly
childish
that
bagnet
can
not
help
laughing
in
her
airy
way
and
saying
oh
lignum
lignum
what
a
precious
old
chap
you
are
but
the
trooper
fails
to
fasten
the
brooch
his
hand
shakes
he
is
nervous
and
it
falls
off
would
any
one
believe
this
says
he
catching
it
as
it
drops
and
looking
round
i
am
so
out
of
sorts
that
i
bungle
at
an
easy
job
like
this
bagnet
concludes
that
for
such
a
case
there
is
no
remedy
like
a
pipe
and
fastening
the
brooch
herself
in
a
twinkling
causes
the
trooper
to
be
inducted
into
his
usual
snug
place
and
the
pipes
to
be
got
into
action
if
that
do
bring
you
round
george
says
she
just
throw
your
eye
across
here
at
your
present
now
and
then
and
the
two
together
must
do
it
you
ought
to
do
it
of
yourself
george
answers
i
know
that
very
well
bagnet
i
tell
you
how
one
way
and
another
the
blues
have
got
to
be
too
many
for
me
here
was
this
poor
lad
was
dull
work
to
see
him
dying
as
he
did
and
not
be
able
to
help
him
what
do
you
mean
george
you
did
help
him
you
took
him
under
your
roof
i
helped
him
so
far
but
that
little
i
mean
bagnet
there
he
was
dying
without
ever
having
been
taught
much
more
than
to
know
his
right
hand
from
his
left
and
he
was
too
far
gone
to
be
helped
out
of
that
ah
poor
creetur
says
bagnet
then
says
the
trooper
not
yet
lighting
his
pipe
and
passing
his
heavy
hand
over
his
hair
that
brought
up
gridley
in
a
man
mind
his
was
a
bad
case
too
in
a
different
way
then
the
two
got
mixed
up
in
a
man
mind
with
a
flinty
old
rascal
who
had
to
do
with
both
and
to
think
of
that
rusty
carbine
stock
and
barrel
standing
up
on
end
in
his
corner
hard
indifferent
taking
everything
so
evenly
it
made
flesh
and
blood
tingle
i
do
assure
you
my
advice
to
you
returns
bagnet
is
to
light
your
pipe
and
tingle
that
way
it
wholesomer
and
comfortabler
and
better
for
the
health
altogether
you
right
says
the
trooper
and
i
do
it
so
he
does
it
though
still
with
an
indignant
gravity
that
impresses
the
young
bagnets
and
even
causes
bagnet
to
defer
the
ceremony
of
drinking
bagnet
health
always
given
by
himself
on
these
occasions
in
a
speech
of
exemplary
terseness
but
the
young
ladies
having
composed
what
bagnet
is
in
the
habit
of
calling
the
mixtur
and
george
pipe
being
now
in
a
glow
bagnet
considers
it
his
duty
to
proceed
to
the
toast
of
the
evening
he
addresses
the
assembled
company
in
the
following
terms
george
woolwich
quebec
malta
this
is
her
birthday
take
a
march
and
you
wo
find
such
another
here
towards
her
the
toast
having
been
drunk
with
enthusiasm
bagnet
returns
thanks
in
a
neat
address
of
corresponding
brevity
this
model
composition
is
limited
to
the
three
words
and
wishing
yours
which
the
old
girl
follows
up
with
a
nod
at
everybody
in
succession
and
a
swig
of
the
mixture
this
she
again
follows
up
on
the
present
occasion
by
the
wholly
unexpected
exclamation
here
a
man
here
is
a
man
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
little
company
looking
in
at
the
he
is
a
man
a
quick
keen
man
and
he
takes
in
everybody
look
at
him
all
at
once
individually
and
collectively
in
a
manner
that
stamps
him
a
remarkable
man
george
says
the
man
nodding
how
do
you
find
yourself
why
it
bucket
cries
george
yes
says
the
man
coming
in
and
closing
the
door
i
was
going
down
the
street
here
when
i
happened
to
stop
and
look
in
at
the
musical
instruments
in
the
a
friend
of
mine
is
in
want
of
a
wiolinceller
of
a
good
tone
and
i
saw
a
party
enjoying
themselves
and
i
thought
it
was
you
in
the
corner
i
thought
i
could
be
mistaken
how
goes
the
world
with
you
george
at
the
present
moment
pretty
smooth
and
with
you
and
with
you
governor
and
lord
says
bucket
opening
his
arms
children
too
you
may
do
anything
with
me
if
you
only
show
me
children
give
us
a
kiss
my
pets
no
occasion
to
inquire
who
your
father
and
mother
is
never
saw
such
a
likeness
in
my
life
bucket
not
unwelcome
has
sat
himself
down
next
to
george
and
taken
quebec
and
malta
on
his
knees
you
pretty
dears
says
bucket
give
us
another
kiss
it
the
only
thing
i
greedy
in
lord
bless
you
how
healthy
you
look
and
what
may
be
the
ages
of
these
two
i
should
put
down
at
the
figures
of
about
eight
and
ten
you
very
near
sir
says
bagnet
i
generally
am
near
returns
bucket
being
so
fond
of
children
a
friend
of
mine
has
had
nineteen
of
all
by
one
mother
and
she
still
as
fresh
and
rosy
as
the
morning
not
so
much
so
as
yourself
but
upon
my
soul
she
comes
near
you
and
what
do
you
call
these
my
darling
pursues
bucket
pinching
cheeks
these
are
peaches
these
are
bless
your
heart
and
what
do
you
think
about
father
do
you
think
father
could
recommend
a
wiolinceller
of
a
good
tone
for
bucket
friend
my
dear
my
name
bucket
ai
that
a
funny
name
these
blandishments
have
entirely
won
the
family
heart
bagnet
forgets
the
day
to
the
extent
of
filling
a
pipe
and
a
glass
for
bucket
and
waiting
upon
him
hospitably
she
would
be
glad
to
receive
so
pleasant
a
character
under
any
circumstances
but
she
tells
him
that
as
a
friend
of
george
she
is
particularly
glad
to
see
him
this
evening
for
george
has
not
been
in
his
usual
spirits
not
in
his
usual
spirits
exclaims
bucket
why
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
what
the
matter
george
you
do
intend
to
tell
me
you
been
out
of
spirits
what
should
you
be
out
of
spirits
for
you
have
got
anything
on
your
mind
you
know
nothing
particular
returns
the
trooper
i
should
think
not
rejoins
bucket
what
could
you
have
on
your
mind
you
know
and
have
these
pets
got
anything
on
their
minds
eh
not
they
but
they
be
upon
the
minds
of
some
of
the
young
fellows
some
of
these
days
and
make
precious
i
ai
much
of
a
prophet
but
i
can
tell
you
that
bagnet
quite
charmed
hopes
bucket
has
a
family
of
his
own
there
says
bucket
would
you
believe
it
no
i
have
my
wife
and
a
lodger
constitute
my
family
bucket
is
as
fond
of
children
as
myself
and
as
wishful
to
have
but
no
so
it
is
worldly
goods
are
divided
unequally
and
man
must
not
repine
what
a
very
nice
backyard
any
way
out
of
that
yard
now
there
is
no
way
out
of
that
yard
ai
there
really
says
bucket
i
should
have
thought
there
might
have
been
well
i
do
know
as
i
ever
saw
a
backyard
that
took
my
fancy
more
would
you
allow
me
to
look
at
it
thank
you
no
i
see
there
no
way
out
but
what
a
very
yard
it
is
having
cast
his
sharp
eye
all
about
it
bucket
returns
to
his
chair
next
his
friend
george
and
pats
george
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
how
are
your
spirits
now
george
all
right
now
returns
the
trooper
that
your
sort
says
bucket
why
should
you
ever
have
been
otherwise
a
man
of
your
fine
figure
and
constitution
has
no
right
to
be
out
of
spirits
that
ai
a
chest
to
be
out
of
spirits
is
it
and
you
have
got
anything
on
your
mind
you
know
george
what
could
you
have
on
your
mind
somewhat
harping
on
this
phrase
considering
the
extent
and
variety
of
his
conversational
powers
bucket
twice
or
thrice
repeats
it
to
the
pipe
he
lights
and
with
a
listening
face
that
is
particularly
his
own
but
the
sun
of
his
sociality
soon
recovers
from
this
brief
eclipse
and
shines
again
and
this
is
brother
is
it
my
dears
says
bucket
referring
to
quebec
and
malta
for
information
on
the
subject
of
young
woolwich
and
a
nice
brother
he
is
i
mean
to
say
for
he
too
old
to
be
your
boy
i
can
certify
at
all
events
that
he
is
not
anybody
else
returns
bagnet
laughing
well
you
do
surprise
me
yet
he
like
you
there
no
denying
lord
he
wonderfully
like
you
but
about
what
you
may
call
the
brow
you
know
there
his
father
comes
out
bucket
compares
the
faces
with
one
eye
shut
up
while
bagnet
smokes
in
stolid
satisfaction
this
is
an
opportunity
for
bagnet
to
inform
him
that
the
boy
is
george
godson
george
godson
is
he
rejoins
bucket
with
extreme
cordiality
i
must
shake
hands
over
again
with
george
godson
godfather
and
godson
do
credit
to
one
another
and
what
do
you
intend
to
make
of
him
does
he
show
any
turn
for
any
musical
instrument
bagnet
suddenly
interposes
plays
the
fife
beautiful
would
you
believe
it
governor
says
bucket
struck
by
the
coincidence
that
when
i
was
a
boy
i
played
the
fife
myself
not
in
a
scientific
way
as
i
expect
he
does
but
by
ear
lord
bless
you
grenadiers
there
a
tune
to
warm
an
englishman
up
could
you
give
us
grenadiers
my
fine
fellow
nothing
could
be
more
acceptable
to
the
little
circle
than
this
call
upon
young
woolwich
who
immediately
fetches
his
fife
and
performs
the
stirring
melody
during
which
performance
bucket
much
enlivened
beats
time
and
never
fails
to
come
in
sharp
with
the
burden
british
in
short
he
shows
so
much
musical
taste
that
bagnet
actually
takes
his
pipe
from
his
lips
to
express
his
conviction
that
he
is
a
singer
bucket
receives
the
harmonious
impeachment
so
modestly
confessing
how
that
he
did
once
chaunt
a
little
for
the
expression
of
the
feelings
of
his
own
bosom
and
with
no
presumptuous
idea
of
entertaining
his
friends
that
he
is
asked
to
sing
not
to
be
behindhand
in
the
sociality
of
the
evening
he
complies
and
gives
them
believe
me
if
all
those
endearing
young
charms
this
ballad
he
informs
bagnet
he
considers
to
have
been
his
most
powerful
ally
in
moving
the
heart
of
bucket
when
a
maiden
and
inducing
her
to
approach
the
altar
bucket
own
words
are
to
come
up
to
the
scratch
this
sparkling
stranger
is
such
a
new
and
agreeable
feature
in
the
evening
that
george
who
testified
no
great
emotions
of
pleasure
on
his
entrance
begins
in
spite
of
himself
to
be
rather
proud
of
him
he
is
so
friendly
is
a
man
of
so
many
resources
and
so
easy
to
get
on
with
that
it
is
something
to
have
made
him
known
there
bagnet
becomes
after
another
pipe
so
sensible
of
the
value
of
his
acquaintance
that
he
solicits
the
honour
of
his
company
on
the
old
girl
next
birthday
if
anything
can
more
closely
cement
and
consolidate
the
esteem
which
bucket
has
formed
for
the
family
it
is
the
discovery
of
the
nature
of
the
occasion
he
drinks
to
bagnet
with
a
warmth
approaching
to
rapture
engages
himself
for
that
day
twelvemonth
more
than
thankfully
makes
a
memorandum
of
the
day
in
a
large
black
with
a
girdle
to
it
and
breathes
a
hope
that
bucket
and
bagnet
may
before
then
become
in
a
manner
sisters
as
he
says
himself
what
is
public
life
without
private
ties
he
is
in
his
humble
way
a
public
man
but
it
is
not
in
that
sphere
that
he
finds
happiness
no
it
must
be
sought
within
the
confines
of
domestic
bliss
it
is
natural
under
these
circumstances
that
he
in
his
turn
should
remember
the
friend
to
whom
he
is
indebted
for
so
promising
an
acquaintance
and
he
does
he
keeps
very
close
to
him
whatever
the
subject
of
the
conversation
he
keeps
a
tender
eye
upon
him
he
waits
to
walk
home
with
him
he
is
interested
in
his
very
boots
and
observes
even
them
attentively
as
george
sits
smoking
in
the
at
length
george
rises
to
depart
at
the
same
moment
bucket
with
the
secret
sympathy
of
friendship
also
rises
he
dotes
upon
the
children
to
the
last
and
remembers
the
commission
he
has
undertaken
for
an
absent
friend
respecting
that
wiolinceller
governor
could
you
recommend
me
such
a
thing
scores
says
bagnet
i
am
obliged
to
you
returns
bucket
squeezing
his
hand
you
a
friend
in
need
a
good
tone
mind
you
my
friend
is
a
regular
dab
at
it
ecod
he
saws
away
at
mozart
and
handel
and
the
rest
of
the
like
a
thorough
workman
and
you
need
says
bucket
in
a
considerate
and
private
voice
you
need
commit
yourself
to
too
low
a
figure
governor
i
do
want
to
pay
too
large
a
price
for
my
friend
but
i
want
you
to
have
your
proper
percentage
and
be
remunerated
for
your
loss
of
time
that
is
but
fair
every
man
must
live
and
ought
to
it
bagnet
shakes
his
head
at
the
old
girl
to
the
effect
that
they
have
found
a
jewel
of
price
suppose
i
was
to
give
you
a
look
in
say
at
half
arter
ten
morning
perhaps
you
could
name
the
figures
of
a
few
wiolincellers
of
a
good
tone
says
bucket
nothing
easier
and
bagnet
both
engage
to
have
the
requisite
information
ready
and
even
hint
to
each
other
at
the
practicability
of
having
a
small
stock
collected
there
for
approval
thank
you
says
bucket
thank
you
good
night
good
night
governor
good
night
darlings
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
one
of
the
pleasantest
evenings
i
ever
spent
in
my
life
they
on
the
contrary
are
much
obliged
to
him
for
the
pleasure
he
has
given
them
in
his
company
and
so
they
part
with
many
expressions
of
goodwill
on
both
sides
now
george
old
boy
says
bucket
taking
his
arm
at
the
come
along
as
they
go
down
the
little
street
and
the
bagnets
pause
for
a
minute
looking
after
them
bagnet
remarks
to
the
worthy
lignum
that
bucket
almost
clings
to
george
like
and
seems
to
be
really
fond
of
him
the
neighbouring
streets
being
narrow
and
it
is
a
little
inconvenient
to
walk
there
two
abreast
and
arm
in
arm
george
therefore
soon
proposes
to
walk
singly
but
bucket
who
can
not
make
up
his
mind
to
relinquish
his
friendly
hold
replies
wait
half
a
minute
george
i
should
wish
to
speak
to
you
first
immediately
afterwards
he
twists
him
into
a
and
into
a
parlour
where
he
confronts
him
and
claps
his
own
back
against
the
door
now
george
says
bucket
duty
is
duty
and
friendship
is
friendship
i
never
want
the
two
to
clash
if
i
can
help
it
i
have
endeavoured
to
make
things
pleasant
and
i
put
it
to
you
whether
i
have
done
it
or
not
you
must
consider
yourself
in
custody
george
custody
what
for
returns
the
trooper
thunderstruck
now
george
says
bucket
urging
a
sensible
view
of
the
case
upon
him
with
his
fat
forefinger
duty
as
you
know
very
well
is
one
thing
and
conversation
is
another
it
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
any
observations
you
may
make
will
be
liable
to
be
used
against
you
therefore
george
be
careful
what
you
say
you
do
happen
to
have
heard
of
a
murder
murder
now
george
says
bucket
keeping
his
forefinger
in
an
impressive
state
of
action
bear
in
mind
what
i
said
to
you
i
ask
you
nothing
you
been
in
low
spirits
this
afternoon
i
say
you
do
happen
to
have
heard
of
a
murder
no
where
has
there
been
a
murder
now
george
says
bucket
do
you
go
and
commit
yourself
i
to
tell
you
what
i
want
you
for
there
has
been
a
murder
in
lincoln
inn
fields
gentleman
of
the
name
of
tulkinghorn
he
was
shot
last
night
i
want
you
for
that
the
trooper
sinks
upon
a
seat
behind
him
and
great
drops
start
out
upon
his
forehead
and
a
deadly
pallor
overspreads
his
face
bucket
it
not
possible
that
tulkinghorn
has
been
killed
and
that
you
suspect
me
george
returns
bucket
keeping
his
forefinger
going
it
is
certainly
possible
because
it
the
case
this
deed
was
done
last
night
at
ten
now
you
know
where
you
were
last
night
at
ten
and
you
be
able
to
prove
it
no
doubt
last
night
last
night
repeats
the
trooper
thoughtfully
then
it
flashes
upon
him
why
great
heaven
i
was
there
last
night
so
i
have
understood
george
returns
bucket
with
great
deliberation
so
i
have
understood
likewise
you
been
very
often
there
you
been
seen
hanging
about
the
place
and
you
been
heard
more
than
once
in
a
wrangle
with
him
and
it
possible
i
do
say
it
certainly
so
mind
you
but
it
possible
that
he
may
have
been
heard
to
call
you
a
threatening
murdering
dangerous
fellow
the

george
continues
bucket
putting
his
hat
upon
the
table
with
an
air
of
business
rather
in
the
upholstery
way
than
otherwise
my
wish
is
as
it
has
been
all
the
evening
to
make
things
pleasant
i
tell
you
plainly
there
a
reward
out
of
a
hundred
guineas
offered
by
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
you
and
me
have
always
been
pleasant
together
but
i
have
got
a
duty
to
discharge
and
if
that
hundred
guineas
is
to
be
made
it
may
as
well
be
made
by
me
as
any
other
man
on
all
of
which
accounts
i
should
hope
it
was
clear
to
you
that
i
must
have
you
and
that
i
damned
if
i
do
have
you
am
i
to
call
in
any
assistance
or
is
the
trick
done
george
has
recovered
himself
and
stands
up
like
a
soldier
come
he
says
i
am
ready
george
continues
bucket
wait
a
bit
with
his
upholsterer
manner
as
if
the
trooper
were
a
window
to
be
fitted
up
he
takes
from
his
pocket
a
pair
of
handcuffs
this
is
a
serious
charge
george
and
such
is
my
duty
the
trooper
flushes
angrily
and
hesitates
a
moment
but
holds
out
his
two
hands
clasped
together
and
says
there
put
them
on
bucket
adjusts
them
in
a
moment
how
do
you
find
them
are
they
comfortable
if
not
say
so
for
i
wish
to
make
things
as
pleasant
as
is
consistent
with
my
duty
and
i
got
another
pair
in
my
pocket
this
remark
he
offers
like
a
most
respectable
tradesman
anxious
to
execute
an
order
neatly
and
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
his
customer
they
do
as
they
are
very
well
now
you
see
george
he
takes
a
cloak
from
a
corner
and
begins
adjusting
it
about
the
trooper
neck
i
was
mindful
of
your
feelings
when
i
come
out
and
brought
this
on
purpose
there
who
the
wiser
only
i
returns
the
trooper
but
as
i
know
it
do
me
one
more
good
turn
and
pull
my
hat
over
my
eyes
really
though
do
you
mean
it
ai
it
a
pity
it
looks
so
i
ca
look

in

with
these
things
on
george

for

sake
pull
my

chapter
l
esther
narrative
it
happened
that
when
i
came
home
from
deal
i
found
a
note
from
caddy
jellyby
as
we
always
continued
to
call
her
informing
me
that
her
health
which
had
been
for
some
time
very
delicate
was
worse
and
that
she
would
be
more
glad
than
she
could
tell
me
if
i
would
go
to
see
her
it
was
a
note
of
a
few
lines
written
from
the
couch
on
which
she
lay
and
enclosed
to
me
in
another
from
her
husband
in
which
he
seconded
her
entreaty
with
much
solicitude
caddy
was
now
the
mother
and
i
the
godmother
of
such
a
poor
little
baby
such
a
tiny
mite
with
a
countenance
that
seemed
to
be
scarcely
anything
but
and
a
little
lean
hand
always
clenched
under
its
chin
it
would
lie
in
this
attitude
all
day
with
its
bright
specks
of
eyes
open
wondering
as
i
used
to
imagine
how
it
came
to
be
so
small
and
weak
whenever
it
was
moved
it
cried
but
at
all
other
times
it
was
so
patient
that
the
sole
desire
of
its
life
appeared
to
be
to
lie
quiet
and
think
it
had
curious
little
dark
veins
in
its
face
and
curious
little
dark
marks
under
its
eyes
like
faint
remembrances
of
poor
caddy
inky
days
and
altogether
to
those
who
were
not
used
to
it
it
was
quite
a
piteous
little
sight
but
it
was
enough
for
caddy
that
she
was
used
to
it
the
projects
with
which
she
beguiled
her
illness
for
little
esther
education
and
little
esther
marriage
and
even
for
her
own
old
age
as
the
grandmother
of
little
esther
little
esthers
was
so
prettily
expressive
of
devotion
to
this
pride
of
her
life
that
i
should
be
tempted
to
recall
some
of
them
but
for
the
timely
remembrance
that
i
am
getting
on
irregularly
as
it
is
to
return
to
the
letter
caddy
had
a
superstition
about
me
which
had
been
strengthening
in
her
mind
ever
since
that
night
long
ago
when
she
had
lain
asleep
with
her
head
in
my
lap
she
almost
i
think
i
must
say
quite
believed
that
i
did
her
good
whenever
i
was
near
her
now
although
this
was
such
a
fancy
of
the
affectionate
girl
that
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
mention
it
still
it
might
have
all
the
force
of
a
fact
when
she
was
really
ill
therefore
i
set
off
to
caddy
with
my
guardian
consent
and
she
and
prince
made
so
much
of
me
that
there
never
was
anything
like
it
next
day
i
went
again
to
sit
with
her
and
next
day
i
went
again
it
was
a
very
easy
journey
for
i
had
only
to
rise
a
little
earlier
in
the
morning
and
keep
my
accounts
and
attend
to
housekeeping
matters
before
leaving
home
but
when
i
had
made
these
three
visits
my
guardian
said
to
me
on
my
return
at
night
now
little
woman
little
woman
this
will
never
do
constant
dropping
will
wear
away
a
stone
and
constant
coaching
will
wear
out
a
dame
durden
we
will
go
to
london
for
a
while
and
take
possession
of
our
old
lodgings
not
for
me
dear
guardian
said
i
for
i
never
feel
tired
which
was
strictly
true
i
was
only
too
happy
to
be
in
such
request
for
me
then
returned
my
guardian
or
for
ada
or
for
both
of
us
it
is
somebody
birthday
i
think
truly
i
think
it
is
said
i
kissing
my
darling
who
would
be
well
observed
my
guardian
half
pleasantly
half
seriously
that
a
great
occasion
and
will
give
my
fair
cousin
some
necessary
business
to
transact
in
assertion
of
her
independence
and
will
make
london
a
more
convenient
place
for
all
of
us
so
to
london
we
will
go
that
being
settled
there
is
another
thing
how
have
you
left
caddy
very
unwell
guardian
i
fear
it
will
be
some
time
before
she
regains
her
health
and
strength
what
do
you
call
some
time
now
asked
my
guardian
thoughtfully
some
weeks
i
am
afraid
ah
he
began
to
walk
about
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
showing
that
he
had
been
thinking
as
much
now
what
do
you
say
about
her
doctor
is
he
a
good
doctor
my
love
i
felt
obliged
to
confess
that
i
knew
nothing
to
the
contrary
but
that
prince
and
i
had
agreed
only
that
evening
that
we
would
like
his
opinion
to
be
confirmed
by
some
one
well
you
know
returned
my
guardian
quickly
there
woodcourt
i
had
not
meant
that
and
was
rather
taken
by
surprise
for
a
moment
all
that
i
had
had
in
my
mind
in
connexion
with
woodcourt
seemed
to
come
back
and
confuse
me
you
do
object
to
him
little
woman
object
to
him
guardian
oh
no
and
you
do
think
the
patient
would
object
to
him
so
far
from
that
i
had
no
doubt
of
her
being
prepared
to
have
a
great
reliance
on
him
and
to
like
him
very
much
i
said
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
her
personally
for
she
had
seen
him
often
in
his
kind
attendance
on
miss
flite
very
good
said
my
guardian
he
has
been
here
my
dear
and
i
will
see
him
about
it
i
felt
in
this
short
conversation
though
i
did
not
know
how
for
she
was
quiet
and
we
interchanged
no
look
that
my
dear
girl
well
remembered
how
merrily
she
had
clasped
me
round
the
waist
when
no
other
hands
than
caddy
had
brought
me
the
little
parting
token
this
caused
me
to
feel
that
i
ought
to
tell
her
and
caddy
too
that
i
was
going
to
be
the
mistress
of
bleak
house
and
that
if
i
avoided
that
disclosure
any
longer
i
might
become
less
worthy
in
my
own
eyes
of
its
master
love
therefore
when
we
went
upstairs
and
had
waited
listening
until
the
clock
struck
twelve
in
order
that
only
i
might
be
the
first
to
wish
my
darling
all
good
wishes
on
her
birthday
and
to
take
her
to
my
heart
i
set
before
her
just
as
i
had
set
before
myself
the
goodness
and
honour
of
her
cousin
john
and
the
happy
life
that
was
in
store
for
me
if
ever
my
darling
were
fonder
of
me
at
one
time
than
another
in
all
our
intercourse
she
was
surely
fondest
of
me
that
night
and
i
was
so
rejoiced
to
know
it
and
so
comforted
by
the
sense
of
having
done
right
in
casting
this
last
idle
reservation
away
that
i
was
ten
times
happier
than
i
had
been
before
i
had
scarcely
thought
it
a
reservation
a
few
hours
ago
but
now
that
it
was
gone
i
felt
as
if
i
understood
its
nature
better
next
day
we
went
to
london
we
found
our
old
lodging
vacant
and
in
half
an
hour
were
quietly
established
there
as
if
we
had
never
gone
away
woodcourt
dined
with
us
to
celebrate
my
darling
birthday
and
we
were
as
pleasant
as
we
could
be
with
the
great
blank
among
us
that
richard
absence
naturally
made
on
such
an
occasion
after
that
day
i
was
for
some
weeks
eight
or
nine
as
i
remember
very
much
with
caddy
and
thus
it
fell
out
that
i
saw
less
of
ada
at
this
time
than
any
other
since
we
had
first
come
together
except
the
time
of
my
own
illness
she
often
came
to
caddy
but
our
function
there
was
to
amuse
and
cheer
her
and
we
did
not
talk
in
our
usual
confidential
manner
whenever
i
went
home
at
night
we
were
together
but
rest
was
broken
by
pain
and
i
often
remained
to
nurse
her
with
her
husband
and
her
poor
little
mite
of
a
baby
to
love
and
their
home
to
strive
for
what
a
good
creature
caddy
was
so
so
uncomplaining
so
anxious
to
get
well
on
their
account
so
afraid
of
giving
trouble
and
so
thoughtful
of
the
unassisted
labours
of
her
husband
and
the
comforts
of
old
turveydrop
i
had
never
known
the
best
of
her
until
now
and
it
seemed
so
curious
that
her
pale
face
and
helpless
figure
should
be
lying
there
day
after
day
where
dancing
was
the
business
of
life
where
the
kit
and
the
apprentices
began
early
every
morning
in
the
and
where
the
untidy
little
boy
waltzed
by
himself
in
the
kitchen
all
the
afternoon
at
caddy
request
i
took
the
supreme
direction
of
her
apartment
trimmed
it
up
and
pushed
her
couch
and
all
into
a
lighter
and
more
airy
and
more
cheerful
corner
than
she
had
yet
occupied
then
every
day
when
we
were
in
our
neatest
array
i
used
to
lay
my
small
small
namesake
in
her
arms
and
sit
down
to
chat
or
work
or
read
to
her
it
was
at
one
of
the
first
of
these
quiet
times
that
i
told
caddy
about
bleak
house
we
had
other
visitors
besides
ada
first
of
all
we
had
prince
who
in
his
hurried
intervals
of
teaching
used
to
come
softly
in
and
sit
softly
down
with
a
face
of
loving
anxiety
for
caddy
and
the
very
little
child
whatever
caddy
condition
really
was
she
never
failed
to
declare
to
prince
that
she
was
all
but
well
which
i
heaven
forgive
me
never
failed
to
confirm
this
would
put
prince
in
such
good
spirits
that
he
would
sometimes
take
the
kit
from
his
pocket
and
play
a
chord
or
two
to
astonish
the
baby
which
i
never
knew
it
to
do
in
the
least
degree
for
my
tiny
namesake
never
noticed
it
at
all
then
there
was
jellyby
she
would
come
occasionally
with
her
usual
distraught
manner
and
sit
calmly
looking
miles
beyond
her
grandchild
as
if
her
attention
were
absorbed
by
a
young
borrioboolan
on
its
native
shores
as
as
ever
as
serene
and
as
untidy
she
would
say
well
caddy
child
and
how
do
you
do
and
then
would
sit
amiably
smiling
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
reply
or
would
sweetly
glide
off
into
a
calculation
of
the
number
of
letters
she
had
lately
received
and
answered
or
of
the
power
of
this
she
would
always
do
with
a
serene
contempt
for
our
limited
sphere
of
action
not
to
be
disguised
then
there
was
old
turveydrop
who
was
from
morning
to
night
and
from
night
to
morning
the
subject
of
innumerable
precautions
if
the
baby
cried
it
was
nearly
stifled
lest
the
noise
should
make
him
uncomfortable
if
the
fire
wanted
stirring
in
the
night
it
was
surreptitiously
done
lest
his
rest
should
be
broken
if
caddy
required
any
little
comfort
that
the
house
contained
she
first
carefully
discussed
whether
he
was
likely
to
require
it
too
in
return
for
this
consideration
he
would
come
into
the
room
once
a
day
all
but
blessing
it
showing
a
condescension
and
a
patronage
and
a
grace
of
manner
in
dispensing
the
light
of
his
presence
from
which
i
might
have
supposed
him
if
i
had
not
known
better
to
have
been
the
benefactor
of
caddy
life
my
caroline
he
would
say
making
the
nearest
approach
that
he
could
to
bending
over
her
tell
me
that
you
are
better
oh
much
better
thank
you
turveydrop
caddy
would
reply
delighted
enchanted
and
our
dear
miss
summerson
she
is
not
quite
prostrated
by
fatigue
here
he
would
crease
up
his
eyelids
and
kiss
his
fingers
to
me
though
i
am
happy
to
say
he
had
ceased
to
be
particular
in
his
attentions
since
i
had
been
so
altered
not
at
all
i
would
assure
him
charming
we
must
take
care
of
our
dear
caroline
miss
summerson
we
must
spare
nothing
that
will
restore
her
we
must
nourish
her
my
dear
caroline
he
would
turn
to
his
with
infinite
generosity
and
protection
want
for
nothing
my
love
frame
a
wish
and
gratify
it
my
daughter
everything
this
house
contains
everything
my
room
contains
is
at
your
service
my
dear
do
not
he
would
sometimes
add
in
a
burst
of
deportment
even
allow
my
simple
requirements
to
be
considered
if
they
should
at
any
time
interfere
with
your
own
my
caroline
your
necessities
are
greater
than
mine
he
had
established
such
a
long
prescriptive
right
to
this
deportment
his
son
inheritance
from
his
mother
that
i
several
times
knew
both
caddy
and
her
husband
to
be
melted
to
tears
by
these
affectionate
nay
my
dears
he
would
remonstrate
and
when
i
saw
caddy
thin
arm
about
his
fat
neck
as
he
said
it
i
would
be
melted
too
though
not
by
the
same
process
nay
nay
i
have
promised
never
to
leave
ye
be
dutiful
and
affectionate
towards
me
and
i
ask
no
other
return
now
bless
ye
i
am
going
to
the
park
he
would
take
the
air
there
presently
and
get
an
appetite
for
his
hotel
dinner
i
hope
i
do
old
turveydrop
no
wrong
but
i
never
saw
any
better
traits
in
him
than
these
i
faithfully
record
except
that
he
certainly
conceived
a
liking
for
peepy
and
would
take
the
child
out
walking
with
great
pomp
always
on
those
occasions
sending
him
home
before
he
went
to
dinner
himself
and
occasionally
with
a
halfpenny
in
his
pocket
but
even
this
disinterestedness
was
attended
with
no
inconsiderable
cost
to
my
knowledge
for
before
peepy
was
sufficiently
decorated
to
walk
hand
in
hand
with
the
professor
of
deportment
he
had
to
be
newly
dressed
at
the
expense
of
caddy
and
her
husband
from
top
to
toe
last
of
our
visitors
there
was
jellyby
really
when
he
used
to
come
in
of
an
evening
and
ask
caddy
in
his
meek
voice
how
she
was
and
then
sit
down
with
his
head
against
the
wall
and
make
no
attempt
to
say
anything
more
i
liked
him
very
much
if
he
found
me
bustling
about
doing
any
little
thing
he
sometimes
half
took
his
coat
off
as
if
with
an
intention
of
helping
by
a
great
exertion
but
he
never
got
any
further
his
sole
occupation
was
to
sit
with
his
head
against
the
wall
looking
hard
at
the
thoughtful
baby
and
i
could
not
quite
divest
my
mind
of
a
fancy
that
they
understood
one
another
i
have
not
counted
woodcourt
among
our
visitors
because
he
was
now
caddy
regular
attendant
she
soon
began
to
improve
under
his
care
but
he
was
so
gentle
so
skilful
so
unwearying
in
the
pains
he
took
that
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
i
am
sure
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
woodcourt
during
this
time
though
not
so
much
as
might
be
supposed
for
knowing
caddy
to
be
safe
in
his
hands
i
often
slipped
home
at
about
the
hours
when
he
was
expected
we
frequently
met
notwithstanding
i
was
quite
reconciled
to
myself
now
but
i
still
felt
glad
to
think
that
he
was
sorry
for
me
and
he
still
was
sorry
for
me
i
believed
he
helped
badger
in
his
professional
engagements
which
were
numerous
and
had
as
yet
no
settled
projects
for
the
future
it
was
when
caddy
began
to
recover
that
i
began
to
notice
a
change
in
my
dear
girl
i
can
not
say
how
it
first
presented
itself
to
me
because
i
observed
it
in
many
slight
particulars
which
were
nothing
in
themselves
and
only
became
something
when
they
were
pieced
together
but
i
made
it
out
by
putting
them
together
that
ada
was
not
so
frankly
cheerful
with
me
as
she
used
to
be
her
tenderness
for
me
was
as
loving
and
true
as
ever
i
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
but
there
was
a
quiet
sorrow
about
her
which
she
did
not
confide
to
me
and
in
which
i
traced
some
hidden
regret
now
i
could
not
understand
this
and
i
was
so
anxious
for
the
happiness
of
my
own
pet
that
it
caused
me
some
uneasiness
and
set
me
thinking
often
at
length
feeling
sure
that
ada
suppressed
this
something
from
me
lest
it
should
make
me
unhappy
too
it
came
into
my
head
that
she
was
a
little
grieved
for
me
by
what
i
had
told
her
about
bleak
house
how
i
persuaded
myself
that
this
was
likely
i
do
know
i
had
no
idea
that
there
was
any
selfish
reference
in
my
doing
so
i
was
not
grieved
for
myself
i
was
quite
contented
and
quite
happy
still
that
ada
might
be
thinking
for
me
though
i
had
abandoned
all
such
thoughts
of
what
once
was
but
was
now
all
changed
seemed
so
easy
to
believe
that
i
believed
it
what
could
i
do
to
reassure
my
darling
i
considered
then
and
show
her
that
i
had
no
such
feelings
well
i
could
only
be
as
brisk
and
busy
as
possible
and
that
i
had
tried
to
be
all
along
however
as
caddy
illness
had
certainly
interfered
more
or
less
with
my
home
duties
though
i
had
always
been
there
in
the
morning
to
make
my
guardian
breakfast
and
he
had
a
hundred
times
laughed
and
said
there
must
be
two
little
women
for
his
little
woman
was
never
missing
i
resolved
to
be
doubly
diligent
and
gay
so
i
went
about
the
house
humming
all
the
tunes
i
knew
and
i
sat
working
and
working
in
a
desperate
manner
and
i
talked
and
talked
morning
noon
and
night
and
still
there
was
the
same
shade
between
me
and
my
darling
so
dame
trot
observed
my
guardian
shutting
up
his
book
one
night
when
we
were
all
three
together
so
woodcourt
has
restored
caddy
jellyby
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
life
again
yes
i
said
and
to
be
repaid
by
such
gratitude
as
hers
is
to
be
made
rich
guardian
i
wish
it
was
he
returned
with
all
my
heart
so
did
i
too
for
that
matter
i
said
so
aye
we
would
make
him
as
rich
as
a
jew
if
we
knew
how
would
we
not
little
woman
i
laughed
as
i
worked
and
replied
that
i
was
not
sure
about
that
for
it
might
spoil
him
and
he
might
not
be
so
useful
and
there
might
be
many
who
could
ill
spare
him
as
miss
flite
and
caddy
herself
and
many
others
true
said
my
guardian
i
had
forgotten
that
but
we
would
agree
to
make
him
rich
enough
to
live
i
suppose
rich
enough
to
work
with
tolerable
peace
of
mind
rich
enough
to
have
his
own
happy
home
and
his
own
household
gods
and
household
goddess
too
perhaps
that
was
quite
another
thing
i
said
we
must
all
agree
in
that
to
be
sure
said
my
guardian
all
of
us
i
have
a
great
regard
for
woodcourt
a
high
esteem
for
him
and
i
have
been
sounding
him
delicately
about
his
plans
it
is
difficult
to
offer
aid
to
an
independent
man
with
that
just
kind
of
pride
which
he
possesses
and
yet
i
would
be
glad
to
do
it
if
i
might
or
if
i
knew
how
he
seems
half
inclined
for
another
voyage
but
that
appears
like
casting
such
a
man
away
it
might
open
a
new
world
to
him
said
i
so
it
might
little
woman
my
guardian
assented
i
doubt
if
he
expects
much
of
the
old
world
do
you
know
i
have
fancied
that
he
sometimes
feels
some
particular
disappointment
or
misfortune
encountered
in
it
you
never
heard
of
anything
of
that
sort
i
shook
my
head
humph
said
my
guardian
i
am
mistaken
i
dare
say
as
there
was
a
little
pause
here
which
i
thought
for
my
dear
satisfaction
had
better
be
filled
up
i
hummed
an
air
as
i
worked
which
was
a
favourite
with
my
guardian
and
do
you
think
woodcourt
will
make
another
voyage
i
asked
him
when
i
had
hummed
it
quietly
all
through
i
do
quite
know
what
to
think
my
dear
but
i
should
say
it
was
likely
at
present
that
he
will
give
a
long
trip
to
another
country
i
am
sure
he
will
take
the
best
wishes
of
all
our
hearts
with
him
wherever
he
goes
said
i
and
though
they
are
not
riches
he
will
never
be
the
poorer
for
them
guardian
at
least
never
little
woman
he
replied
i
was
sitting
in
my
usual
place
which
was
now
beside
my
chair
that
had
not
been
my
usual
place
before
the
letter
but
it
was
now
i
looked
up
to
ada
who
was
sitting
opposite
and
i
saw
as
she
looked
at
me
that
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
that
tears
were
falling
down
her
face
i
felt
that
i
had
only
to
be
placid
and
merry
once
for
all
to
undeceive
my
dear
and
set
her
loving
heart
at
rest
i
really
was
so
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
be
myself
so
i
made
my
sweet
girl
lean
upon
my
shoulder
how
little
thinking
what
was
heavy
on
her
mind
and
i
said
she
was
not
quite
well
and
put
my
arm
about
her
and
took
her
upstairs
when
we
were
in
our
own
room
and
when
she
might
perhaps
have
told
me
what
i
was
so
unprepared
to
hear
i
gave
her
no
encouragement
to
confide
in
me
i
never
thought
she
stood
in
need
of
it
oh
my
dear
good
esther
said
ada
if
i
could
only
make
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
and
my
cousin
john
when
you
are
together
why
my
love
i
remonstrated
ada
why
should
you
not
speak
to
us
ada
only
dropped
her
head
and
pressed
me
closer
to
her
heart
you
surely
do
forget
my
beauty
said
i
smiling
what
quiet
people
we
are
and
how
i
have
settled
down
to
be
the
discreetest
of
dames
you
do
forget
how
happily
and
peacefully
my
life
is
all
marked
out
for
me
and
by
whom
i
am
certain
that
you
do
forget
by
what
a
noble
character
ada
that
can
never
be
no
never
esther
why
then
my
dear
said
i
there
can
be
nothing
amiss
and
why
should
you
not
speak
to
us
nothing
amiss
esther
returned
ada
oh
when
i
think
of
all
these
years
and
of
his
fatherly
care
and
kindness
and
of
the
old
relations
among
us
and
of
you
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
i
looked
at
my
child
in
some
wonder
but
i
thought
it
better
not
to
answer
otherwise
than
by
cheering
her
and
so
i
turned
off
into
many
little
recollections
of
our
life
together
and
prevented
her
from
saying
more
when
she
lay
down
to
sleep
and
not
before
i
returned
to
my
guardian
to
say
good
night
and
then
i
came
back
to
ada
and
sat
near
her
for
a
little
while
she
was
asleep
and
i
thought
as
i
looked
at
her
that
she
was
a
little
changed
i
had
thought
so
more
than
once
lately
i
could
not
decide
even
looking
at
her
while
she
was
unconscious
how
she
was
changed
but
something
in
the
familiar
beauty
of
her
face
looked
different
to
me
my
guardian
old
hopes
of
her
and
richard
arose
sorrowfully
in
my
mind
and
i
said
to
myself
she
has
been
anxious
about
him
and
i
wondered
how
that
love
would
end
when
i
had
come
home
from
caddy
while
she
was
ill
i
had
often
found
ada
at
work
and
she
had
always
put
her
work
away
and
i
had
never
known
what
it
was
some
of
it
now
lay
in
a
drawer
near
her
which
was
not
quite
closed
i
did
not
open
the
drawer
but
i
still
rather
wondered
what
the
work
could
be
for
it
was
evidently
nothing
for
herself
and
i
noticed
as
i
kissed
my
dear
that
she
lay
with
one
hand
under
her
pillow
so
that
it
was
hidden
how
much
less
amiable
i
must
have
been
than
they
thought
me
how
much
less
amiable
than
i
thought
myself
to
be
so
preoccupied
with
my
own
cheerfulness
and
contentment
as
to
think
that
it
only
rested
with
me
to
put
my
dear
girl
right
and
set
her
mind
at
peace
but
i
lay
down
in
that
belief
and
i
awoke
in
it
next
day
to
find
that
there
was
still
the
same
shade
between
me
and
my
darling
chapter
li
enlightened
when
woodcourt
arrived
in
london
he
went
that
very
same
day
to
vholes
in
symond
inn
for
he
never
once
from
the
moment
when
i
entreated
him
to
be
a
friend
to
richard
neglected
or
forgot
his
promise
he
had
told
me
that
he
accepted
the
charge
as
a
sacred
trust
and
he
was
ever
true
to
it
in
that
spirit
he
found
vholes
in
his
office
and
informed
vholes
of
his
agreement
with
richard
that
he
should
call
there
to
learn
his
address
just
so
sir
said
vholes
address
is
not
a
hundred
miles
from
here
sir
address
is
not
a
hundred
miles
from
here
would
you
take
a
seat
sir
woodcourt
thanked
vholes
but
he
had
no
business
with
him
beyond
what
he
had
mentioned
just
so
sir
i
believe
sir
said
vholes
still
quietly
insisting
on
the
seat
by
not
giving
the
address
that
you
have
influence
with
indeed
i
am
aware
that
you
have
i
was
not
aware
of
it
myself
returned
woodcourt
but
i
suppose
you
know
best
sir
rejoined
vholes
as
usual
voice
and
all
it
is
a
part
of
my
professional
duty
to
know
best
it
is
a
part
of
my
professional
duty
to
study
and
to
understand
a
gentleman
who
confides
his
interests
to
me
in
my
professional
duty
i
shall
not
be
wanting
sir
if
i
know
it
i
may
with
the
best
intentions
be
wanting
in
it
without
knowing
it
but
not
if
i
know
it
sir
woodcourt
again
mentioned
the
address
give
me
leave
sir
said
vholes
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
sir
is
playing
for
a
considerable
stake
and
can
not
play
without
need
i
say
what
money
i
presume
sir
said
vholes
to
be
honest
with
you
honesty
being
my
golden
rule
whether
i
gain
by
it
or
lose
and
i
find
that
i
generally
lose
money
is
the
word
now
sir
upon
the
chances
of
game
i
express
to
you
no
opinion
no
opinion
it
might
be
highly
impolitic
in
after
playing
so
long
and
so
high
to
leave
off
it
might
be
the
reverse
i
say
nothing
no
sir
said
vholes
bringing
his
hand
flat
down
upon
his
desk
in
a
positive
manner
nothing
you
seem
to
forget
returned
woodcourt
that
i
ask
you
to
say
nothing
and
have
no
interest
in
anything
you
say
pardon
me
sir
retorted
vholes
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
no
sir
pardon
me
you
shall
not
shall
not
in
my
office
if
i
know
it
do
yourself
an
injustice
you
are
interested
in
anything
and
in
everything
that
relates
to
your
friend
i
know
human
nature
much
better
sir
than
to
admit
for
an
instant
that
a
gentleman
of
your
appearance
is
not
interested
in
whatever
concerns
his
friend
well
replied
woodcourt
that
may
be
i
am
particularly
interested
in
his
address
the
number
sir
said
vholes
parenthetically
i
believe
i
have
already
mentioned
if
is
to
continue
to
play
for
this
considerable
stake
sir
he
must
have
funds
understand
me
there
are
funds
in
hand
at
present
i
ask
for
nothing
there
are
funds
in
hand
but
for
the
onward
play
more
funds
must
be
provided
unless
is
to
throw
away
what
he
has
already
ventured
which
is
wholly
and
solely
a
point
for
his
consideration
this
sir
i
take
the
opportunity
of
stating
openly
to
you
as
the
friend
of
without
funds
i
shall
always
be
happy
to
appear
and
act
for
to
the
extent
of
all
such
costs
as
are
safe
to
be
allowed
out
of
the
estate
not
beyond
that
i
could
not
go
beyond
that
sir
without
wronging
some
one
i
must
either
wrong
my
three
dear
girls
or
my
venerable
father
who
is
entirely
dependent
on
me
in
the
vale
of
taunton
or
some
one
whereas
sir
my
resolution
is
call
it
weakness
or
folly
if
you
please
to
wrong
no
one
woodcourt
rather
sternly
rejoined
that
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
i
wish
sir
said
vholes
to
leave
a
good
name
behind
me
therefore
i
take
every
opportunity
of
openly
stating
to
a
friend
of
how
is
situated
as
to
myself
sir
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
if
i
undertake
to
put
my
shoulder
to
the
wheel
i
do
it
and
i
earn
what
i
get
i
am
here
for
that
purpose
my
name
is
painted
on
the
door
outside
with
that
object
and
carstone
address
mr
vholes
sir
returned
vholes
as
i
believe
i
have
already
mentioned
it
is
next
door
on
the
second
story
you
will
find
apartments
desires
to
be
near
his
professional
adviser
and
i
am
far
from
objecting
for
i
court
inquiry
upon
this
woodcourt
wished
vholes
good
day
and
went
in
search
of
richard
the
change
in
whose
appearance
he
began
to
understand
now
but
too
well
he
found
him
in
a
dull
room
fadedly
furnished
much
as
i
had
found
him
in
his
but
a
little
while
before
except
that
he
was
not
writing
but
was
sitting
with
a
book
before
him
from
which
his
eyes
and
thoughts
were
far
astray
as
the
door
chanced
to
be
standing
open
woodcourt
was
in
his
presence
for
some
moments
without
being
perceived
and
he
told
me
that
he
never
could
forget
the
haggardness
of
his
face
and
the
dejection
of
his
manner
before
he
was
aroused
from
his
dream
woodcourt
my
dear
fellow
cried
richard
starting
up
with
extended
hands
you
come
upon
my
vision
like
a
ghost
a
friendly
one
he
replied
and
only
waiting
as
they
say
ghosts
do
to
be
addressed
how
does
the
mortal
world
go
they
were
seated
now
near
together
badly
enough
and
slowly
enough
said
richard
speaking
at
least
for
my
part
of
it
what
part
is
that
the
chancery
part
i
never
heard
returned
woodcourt
shaking
his
head
of
its
going
well
yet
nor
i
said
richard
moodily
who
ever
did
he
brightened
again
in
a
moment
and
said
with
his
natural
openness
woodcourt
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
misunderstood
by
you
even
if
i
gained
by
it
in
your
estimation
you
must
know
that
i
have
done
no
good
this
long
time
i
have
not
intended
to
do
much
harm
but
i
seem
to
have
been
capable
of
nothing
else
it
may
be
that
i
should
have
done
better
by
keeping
out
of
the
net
into
which
my
destiny
has
worked
me
but
i
think
not
though
i
dare
say
you
will
soon
hear
if
you
have
not
already
heard
a
very
different
opinion
to
make
short
of
a
long
story
i
am
afraid
i
have
wanted
an
object
but
i
have
an
object
now
or
it
has
me
and
it
is
too
late
to
discuss
it
take
me
as
i
am
and
make
the
best
of
me
a
bargain
said
woodcourt
do
as
much
by
me
in
return
oh
you
returned
richard
you
can
pursue
your
art
for
its
own
sake
and
can
put
your
hand
upon
the
plough
and
never
turn
and
can
strike
a
purpose
out
of
anything
you
and
i
are
very
different
creatures
he
spoke
regretfully
and
lapsed
for
a
moment
into
his
weary
condition
well
well
he
cried
shaking
it
off
everything
has
an
end
we
shall
see
so
you
will
take
me
as
i
am
and
make
the
best
of
me
aye
indeed
i
will
they
shook
hands
upon
it
laughingly
but
in
deep
earnestness
i
can
answer
for
one
of
them
with
my
heart
of
hearts
you
come
as
a
godsend
said
richard
for
i
have
seen
nobody
here
yet
but
vholes
woodcourt
there
is
one
subject
i
should
like
to
mention
for
once
and
for
all
in
the
beginning
of
our
treaty
you
can
hardly
make
the
best
of
me
if
i
do
you
know
i
dare
say
that
i
have
an
attachment
to
my
cousin
ada
woodcourt
replied
that
i
had
hinted
as
much
to
him
now
pray
returned
richard
do
think
me
a
heap
of
selfishness
suppose
that
i
am
splitting
my
head
and
half
breaking
my
heart
over
this
miserable
chancery
suit
for
my
own
rights
and
interests
alone
ada
are
bound
up
with
mine
they
ca
be
separated
vholes
works
for
both
of
us
do
think
of
that
he
was
so
very
solicitous
on
this
head
that
woodcourt
gave
him
the
strongest
assurances
that
he
did
him
no
injustice
you
see
said
richard
with
something
pathetic
in
his
manner
of
lingering
on
the
point
though
it
was
and
unstudied
to
an
upright
fellow
like
you
bringing
a
friendly
face
like
yours
here
i
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
appearing
selfish
and
mean
i
want
to
see
ada
righted
woodcourt
as
well
as
myself
i
want
to
do
my
utmost
to
right
her
as
well
as
myself
i
venture
what
i
can
scrape
together
to
extricate
her
as
well
as
myself
do
i
beseech
you
think
of
that
afterwards
when
woodcourt
came
to
reflect
on
what
had
passed
he
was
so
very
much
impressed
by
the
strength
of
richard
anxiety
on
this
point
that
in
telling
me
generally
of
his
first
visit
to
symond
inn
he
particularly
dwelt
upon
it
it
revived
a
fear
i
had
had
before
that
my
dear
girl
little
property
would
be
absorbed
by
vholes
and
that
richard
justification
to
himself
would
be
sincerely
this
it
was
just
as
i
began
to
take
care
of
caddy
that
the
interview
took
place
and
i
now
return
to
the
time
when
caddy
had
recovered
and
the
shade
was
still
between
me
and
my
darling
i
proposed
to
ada
that
morning
that
we
should
go
and
see
richard
it
a
little
surprised
me
to
find
that
she
hesitated
and
was
not
so
radiantly
willing
as
i
had
expected
my
dear
said
i
you
have
not
had
any
difference
with
richard
since
i
have
been
so
much
away
no
esther
not
heard
of
him
perhaps
said
i
yes
i
have
heard
of
him
said
ada
such
tears
in
her
eyes
and
such
love
in
her
face
i
could
not
make
my
darling
out
should
i
go
to
richard
by
myself
i
said
no
ada
thought
i
had
better
not
go
by
myself
would
she
go
with
me
yes
ada
thought
she
had
better
go
with
me
should
we
go
now
yes
let
us
go
now
well
i
could
not
understand
my
darling
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
the
love
in
her
face
we
were
soon
equipped
and
went
out
it
was
a
sombre
day
and
drops
of
chill
rain
fell
at
intervals
it
was
one
of
those
colourless
days
when
everything
looks
heavy
and
harsh
the
houses
frowned
at
us
the
dust
rose
at
us
the
smoke
swooped
at
us
nothing
made
any
compromise
about
itself
or
wore
a
softened
aspect
i
fancied
my
beautiful
girl
quite
out
of
place
in
the
rugged
streets
and
i
thought
there
were
more
funerals
passing
along
the
dismal
pavements
than
i
had
ever
seen
before
we
had
first
to
find
out
symond
inn
we
were
going
to
inquire
in
a
shop
when
ada
said
she
thought
it
was
near
chancery
lane
we
are
not
likely
to
be
far
out
my
love
if
we
go
in
that
direction
said
i
so
to
chancery
lane
we
went
and
there
sure
enough
we
saw
it
written
up
symond
inn
we
had
next
to
find
out
the
number
or
vholes
office
will
do
i
recollected
for
vholes
office
is
next
door
upon
which
ada
said
perhaps
that
was
vholes
office
in
the
corner
there
and
it
really
was
then
came
the
question
which
of
the
two
next
doors
i
was
going
for
the
one
and
my
darling
was
going
for
the
other
and
my
darling
was
right
again
so
up
we
went
to
the
second
story
when
we
came
to
richard
name
in
great
white
letters
on
a
panel
i
should
have
knocked
but
ada
said
perhaps
we
had
better
turn
the
handle
and
go
in
thus
we
came
to
richard
poring
over
a
table
covered
with
dusty
bundles
of
papers
which
seemed
to
me
like
dusty
mirrors
reflecting
his
own
mind
wherever
i
looked
i
saw
the
ominous
words
that
ran
in
it
repeated
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
he
received
us
very
affectionately
and
we
sat
down
if
you
had
come
a
little
earlier
he
said
you
would
have
found
woodcourt
here
there
never
was
such
a
good
fellow
as
woodcourt
is
he
finds
time
to
look
in
when
anybody
else
with
half
his
work
to
do
would
be
thinking
about
not
being
able
to
come
and
he
is
so
cheery
so
fresh
so
sensible
so
earnest
so
everything
that
i
am
not
that
the
place
brightens
whenever
he
comes
and
darkens
whenever
he
goes
again
god
bless
him
i
thought
for
his
truth
to
me
he
is
not
so
sanguine
ada
continued
richard
casting
his
dejected
look
over
the
bundles
of
papers
as
vholes
and
i
are
usually
but
he
is
only
an
outsider
and
is
not
in
the
mysteries
we
have
gone
into
them
and
he
has
not
he
ca
be
expected
to
know
much
of
such
a
labyrinth
as
his
look
wandered
over
the
papers
again
and
he
passed
his
two
hands
over
his
head
i
noticed
how
sunken
and
how
large
his
eyes
appeared
how
dry
his
lips
were
and
how
his
were
all
bitten
away
is
this
a
healthy
place
to
live
in
richard
do
you
think
said
i
why
my
dear
minerva
answered
richard
with
his
old
gay
laugh
it
is
neither
a
rural
nor
a
cheerful
place
and
when
the
sun
shines
here
you
may
lay
a
pretty
heavy
wager
that
it
is
shining
brightly
in
an
open
spot
but
it
well
enough
for
the
time
it
near
the
offices
and
near
vholes
perhaps
i
hinted
a
change
from
both
might
do
me
good
said
richard
forcing
a
laugh
as
he
finished
the
sentence
i
should
wonder
but
it
can
only
come
in
one
way
now
in
one
of
two
ways
i
should
rather
say
either
the
suit
must
be
ended
esther
or
the
suitor
but
it
shall
be
the
suit
my
dear
girl
the
suit
my
dear
girl
these
latter
words
were
addressed
to
ada
who
was
sitting
nearest
to
him
her
face
being
turned
away
from
me
and
towards
him
i
could
not
see
it
we
are
doing
very
well
pursued
richard
vholes
will
tell
you
so
we
are
really
spinning
along
ask
vholes
we
are
giving
them
no
rest
vholes
knows
all
their
windings
and
turnings
and
we
are
upon
them
everywhere
we
have
astonished
them
already
we
shall
rouse
up
that
nest
of
sleepers
mark
my
words
his
hopefulness
had
long
been
more
painful
to
me
than
his
despondency
it
was
so
unlike
hopefulness
had
something
so
fierce
in
its
determination
to
be
it
was
so
hungry
and
eager
and
yet
so
conscious
of
being
forced
and
unsustainable
that
it
had
long
touched
me
to
the
heart
but
the
commentary
upon
it
now
indelibly
written
in
his
handsome
face
made
it
far
more
distressing
than
it
used
to
be
i
say
indelibly
for
i
felt
persuaded
that
if
the
fatal
cause
could
have
been
for
ever
terminated
according
to
his
brightest
visions
in
that
same
hour
the
traces
of
the
premature
anxiety
and
disappointment
it
had
occasioned
him
would
have
remained
upon
his
features
to
the
hour
of
his
death
the
sight
of
our
dear
little
woman
said
richard
ada
still
remaining
silent
and
quiet
is
so
natural
to
me
and
her
compassionate
face
is
so
like
the
face
of
old
days
ah
no
no
i
smiled
and
shook
my
so
exactly
like
the
face
of
old
days
said
richard
in
his
cordial
voice
and
taking
my
hand
with
the
brotherly
regard
which
nothing
ever
changed
that
i
ca
make
pretences
with
her
i
fluctuate
a
little
that
the
truth
sometimes
i
hope
my
dear
and
sometimes
i
do
quite
despair
but
nearly
i
get
said
richard
relinquishing
my
hand
gently
and
walking
across
the
room
so
tired
he
took
a
few
turns
up
and
down
and
sunk
upon
the
sofa
i
get
he
repeated
gloomily
so
tired
it
is
such
weary
weary
work
he
was
leaning
on
his
arm
saying
these
words
in
a
meditative
voice
and
looking
at
the
ground
when
my
darling
rose
put
off
her
bonnet
kneeled
down
beside
him
with
her
golden
hair
falling
like
sunlight
on
his
head
clasped
her
two
arms
round
his
neck
and
turned
her
face
to
me
oh
what
a
loving
and
devoted
face
i
saw
esther
dear
she
said
very
quietly
i
am
not
going
home
again
a
light
shone
in
upon
me
all
at
once
never
any
more
i
am
going
to
stay
with
my
dear
husband
we
have
been
married
above
two
months
go
home
without
me
my
own
esther
i
shall
never
go
home
any
more
with
those
words
my
darling
drew
his
head
down
on
her
breast
and
held
it
there
and
if
ever
in
my
life
i
saw
a
love
that
nothing
but
death
could
change
i
saw
it
then
before
me
speak
to
esther
my
dearest
said
richard
breaking
the
silence
presently
tell
her
how
it
was
i
met
her
before
she
could
come
to
me
and
folded
her
in
my
arms
we
neither
of
us
spoke
but
with
her
cheek
against
my
own
i
wanted
to
hear
nothing
my
pet
said
i
my
love
my
poor
poor
girl
i
pitied
her
so
much
i
was
very
fond
of
richard
but
the
impulse
that
i
had
upon
me
was
to
pity
her
so
much
esther
will
you
forgive
me
will
my
cousin
john
forgive
me
my
dear
said
i
to
doubt
it
for
a
moment
is
to
do
him
a
great
wrong
and
as
to
me
why
as
to
me
what
had
i
to
forgive
i
dried
my
sobbing
darling
eyes
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
sofa
and
richard
sat
on
my
other
side
and
while
i
was
reminded
of
that
so
different
night
when
they
had
first
taken
me
into
their
confidence
and
had
gone
on
in
their
own
wild
happy
way
they
told
me
between
them
how
it
was
all
i
had
was
richard
ada
said
and
richard
would
not
take
it
esther
and
what
could
i
do
but
be
his
wife
when
i
loved
him
dearly
and
you
were
so
fully
and
so
kindly
occupied
excellent
dame
durden
said
richard
that
how
could
we
speak
to
you
at
such
a
time
and
besides
it
was
not
a
step
we
went
out
one
morning
and
were
married
and
when
it
was
done
esther
said
my
darling
i
was
always
thinking
how
to
tell
you
and
what
to
do
for
the
best
and
sometimes
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
it
directly
and
sometimes
i
thought
you
ought
not
to
know
it
and
keep
it
from
my
cousin
john
and
i
could
not
tell
what
to
do
and
i
fretted
very
much
how
selfish
i
must
have
been
not
to
have
thought
of
this
before
i
do
know
what
i
said
now
i
was
so
sorry
and
yet
i
was
so
fond
of
them
and
so
glad
that
they
were
fond
of
me
i
pitied
them
so
much
and
yet
i
felt
a
kind
of
pride
in
their
loving
one
another
i
never
had
experienced
such
painful
and
pleasurable
emotion
at
one
time
and
in
my
own
heart
i
did
not
know
which
predominated
but
i
was
not
there
to
darken
their
way
i
did
not
do
that
when
i
was
less
foolish
and
more
composed
my
darling
took
her
from
her
bosom
and
kissed
it
and
put
it
on
then
i
remembered
last
night
and
told
richard
that
ever
since
her
marriage
she
had
worn
it
at
night
when
there
was
no
one
to
see
then
ada
blushingly
asked
me
how
did
i
know
that
my
dear
then
i
told
ada
how
i
had
seen
her
hand
concealed
under
her
pillow
and
had
little
thought
why
my
dear
then
they
began
telling
me
how
it
was
all
over
again
and
i
began
to
be
sorry
and
glad
again
and
foolish
again
and
to
hide
my
plain
old
face
as
much
as
i
could
lest
i
should
put
them
out
of
heart
thus
the
time
went
on
until
it
became
necessary
for
me
to
think
of
returning
when
that
time
arrived
it
was
the
worst
of
all
for
then
my
darling
completely
broke
down
she
clung
round
my
neck
calling
me
by
every
dear
name
she
could
think
of
and
saying
what
should
she
do
without
me
nor
was
richard
much
better
and
as
for
me
i
should
have
been
the
worst
of
the
three
if
i
had
not
severely
said
to
myself
now
esther
if
you
do
i
never
speak
to
you
again
why
i
declare
said
i
i
never
saw
such
a
wife
i
do
think
she
loves
her
husband
at
all
here
richard
take
my
child
for
sake
but
i
held
her
tight
all
the
while
and
could
have
wept
over
her
i
do
know
how
long
i
give
this
dear
young
couple
notice
said
i
that
i
am
only
going
away
to
come
back
and
that
i
shall
be
always
coming
backwards
and
forwards
until
symond
inn
is
tired
of
the
sight
of
me
so
i
shall
not
say
richard
for
what
would
be
the
use
of
that
you
know
when
i
am
coming
back
so
soon
i
had
given
my
darling
to
him
now
and
i
meant
to
go
but
i
lingered
for
one
more
look
of
the
precious
face
which
it
seemed
to
rive
my
heart
to
turn
from
so
i
said
in
a
merry
bustling
manner
that
unless
they
gave
me
some
encouragement
to
come
back
i
was
not
sure
that
i
could
take
that
liberty
upon
which
my
dear
girl
looked
up
faintly
smiling
through
her
tears
and
i
folded
her
lovely
face
between
my
hands
and
gave
it
one
last
kiss
and
laughed
and
ran
away
and
when
i
got
downstairs
oh
how
i
cried
it
almost
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
lost
my
ada
for
ever
i
was
so
lonely
and
so
blank
without
her
and
it
was
so
desolate
to
be
going
home
with
no
hope
of
seeing
her
there
that
i
could
get
no
comfort
for
a
little
while
as
i
walked
up
and
down
in
a
dim
corner
sobbing
and
crying
i
came
to
myself
by
and
by
after
a
little
scolding
and
took
a
coach
home
the
poor
boy
whom
i
had
found
at
albans
had
reappeared
a
short
time
before
and
was
lying
at
the
point
of
death
indeed
was
then
dead
though
i
did
not
know
it
my
guardian
had
gone
out
to
inquire
about
him
and
did
not
return
to
dinner
being
quite
alone
i
cried
a
little
again
though
on
the
whole
i
do
think
i
behaved
so
very
very
ill
it
was
only
natural
that
i
should
not
be
quite
accustomed
to
the
loss
of
my
darling
yet
three
or
four
hours
were
not
a
long
time
after
years
but
my
mind
dwelt
so
much
upon
the
uncongenial
scene
in
which
i
had
left
her
and
i
pictured
it
as
such
an
overshadowed
one
and
i
so
longed
to
be
near
her
and
taking
some
sort
of
care
of
her
that
i
determined
to
go
back
in
the
evening
only
to
look
up
at
her
windows
it
was
foolish
i
dare
say
but
it
did
not
then
seem
at
all
so
to
me
and
it
does
not
seem
quite
so
even
now
i
took
charley
into
my
confidence
and
we
went
out
at
dusk
it
was
dark
when
we
came
to
the
new
strange
home
of
my
dear
girl
and
there
was
a
light
behind
the
yellow
blinds
we
walked
past
cautiously
three
or
four
times
looking
up
and
narrowly
missed
encountering
vholes
who
came
out
of
his
office
while
we
were
there
and
turned
his
head
to
look
up
too
before
going
home
the
sight
of
his
lank
black
figure
and
the
lonesome
air
of
that
nook
in
the
dark
were
favourable
to
the
state
of
my
mind
i
thought
of
the
youth
and
love
and
beauty
of
my
dear
girl
shut
up
in
such
an
refuge
almost
as
if
it
were
a
cruel
place
it
was
very
solitary
and
very
dull
and
i
did
not
doubt
that
i
might
safely
steal
upstairs
i
left
charley
below
and
went
up
with
a
light
foot
not
distressed
by
any
glare
from
the
feeble
oil
lanterns
on
the
way
i
listened
for
a
few
moments
and
in
the
musty
rotting
silence
of
the
house
believed
that
i
could
hear
the
murmur
of
their
young
voices
i
put
my
lips
to
the
panel
of
the
door
as
a
kiss
for
my
dear
and
came
quietly
down
again
thinking
that
one
of
these
days
i
would
confess
to
the
visit
and
it
really
did
me
good
for
though
nobody
but
charley
and
i
knew
anything
about
it
i
somehow
felt
as
if
it
had
diminished
the
separation
between
ada
and
me
and
had
brought
us
together
again
for
those
moments
i
went
back
not
quite
accustomed
yet
to
the
change
but
all
the
better
for
that
hovering
about
my
darling
my
guardian
had
come
home
and
was
standing
thoughtfully
by
the
dark
window
when
i
went
in
his
face
cleared
and
he
came
to
his
seat
but
he
caught
the
light
upon
my
face
as
i
took
mine
little
woman
said
he
you
have
been
crying
why
yes
guardian
said
i
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
a
little
ada
has
been
in
such
distress
and
is
so
very
sorry
guardian
i
put
my
arm
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
i
saw
in
his
glance
that
my
words
and
my
look
at
her
empty
place
had
prepared
him
is
she
married
my
dear
i
told
him
all
about
it
and
how
her
first
entreaties
had
referred
to
his
forgiveness
she
has
no
need
of
it
said
he
heaven
bless
her
and
her
husband
but
just
as
my
first
impulse
had
been
to
pity
her
so
was
his
poor
girl
poor
girl
poor
rick
poor
ada
neither
of
us
spoke
after
that
until
he
said
with
a
sigh
well
well
my
dear
bleak
house
is
thinning
fast
but
its
mistress
remains
guardian
though
i
was
timid
about
saying
it
i
ventured
because
of
the
sorrowful
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
she
will
do
all
she
can
to
make
it
happy
said
i
she
will
succeed
my
love
the
letter
had
made
no
difference
between
us
except
that
the
seat
by
his
side
had
come
to
be
mine
it
made
none
now
he
turned
his
old
bright
fatherly
look
upon
me
laid
his
hand
on
my
hand
in
his
old
way
and
said
again
she
will
succeed
my
dear
nevertheless
bleak
house
is
thinning
fast
o
little
woman
i
was
sorry
presently
that
this
was
all
we
said
about
that
i
was
rather
disappointed
i
feared
i
might
not
quite
have
been
all
i
had
meant
to
be
since
the
letter
and
the
answer
chapter
lii
obstinacy
but
one
other
day
had
intervened
when
early
in
the
morning
as
we
were
going
to
breakfast
woodcourt
came
in
haste
with
the
astounding
news
that
a
terrible
murder
had
been
committed
for
which
george
had
been
apprehended
and
was
in
custody
when
he
told
us
that
a
large
reward
was
offered
by
sir
leicester
dedlock
for
the
murderer
apprehension
i
did
not
in
my
first
consternation
understand
why
but
a
few
more
words
explained
to
me
that
the
murdered
person
was
sir
leicester
lawyer
and
immediately
my
mother
dread
of
him
rushed
into
my
remembrance
this
unforeseen
and
violent
removal
of
one
whom
she
had
long
watched
and
distrusted
and
who
had
long
watched
and
distrusted
her
one
for
whom
she
could
have
had
few
intervals
of
kindness
always
dreading
in
him
a
dangerous
and
secret
enemy
appeared
so
awful
that
my
first
thoughts
were
of
her
how
appalling
to
hear
of
such
a
death
and
be
able
to
feel
no
pity
how
dreadful
to
remember
perhaps
that
she
had
sometimes
even
wished
the
old
man
away
who
was
so
swiftly
hurried
out
of
life
such
crowding
reflections
increasing
the
distress
and
fear
i
always
felt
when
the
name
was
mentioned
made
me
so
agitated
that
i
could
scarcely
hold
my
place
at
the
table
i
was
quite
unable
to
follow
the
conversation
until
i
had
had
a
little
time
to
recover
but
when
i
came
to
myself
and
saw
how
shocked
my
guardian
was
and
found
that
they
were
earnestly
speaking
of
the
suspected
man
and
recalling
every
favourable
impression
we
had
formed
of
him
out
of
the
good
we
had
known
of
him
my
interest
and
my
fears
were
so
strongly
aroused
in
his
behalf
that
i
was
quite
set
up
again
guardian
you
do
think
it
possible
that
he
is
justly
accused
my
dear
i
ca
think
so
this
man
whom
we
have
seen
so
and
compassionate
who
with
the
might
of
a
giant
has
the
gentleness
of
a
child
who
looks
as
brave
a
fellow
as
ever
lived
and
is
so
simple
and
quiet
with
it
this
man
justly
accused
of
such
a
crime
i
ca
believe
it
it
not
that
i
do
or
i
wo
i
ca
and
i
ca
said
woodcourt
still
whatever
we
believe
or
know
of
him
we
had
better
not
forget
that
some
appearances
are
against
him
he
bore
an
animosity
towards
the
deceased
gentleman
he
has
openly
mentioned
it
in
many
places
he
is
said
to
have
expressed
himself
violently
towards
him
and
he
certainly
did
about
him
to
my
knowledge
he
admits
that
he
was
alone
on
the
scene
of
the
murder
within
a
few
minutes
of
its
commission
i
sincerely
believe
him
to
be
as
innocent
of
any
participation
in
it
as
i
am
but
these
are
all
reasons
for
suspicion
falling
upon
him
true
said
my
guardian
and
he
added
turning
to
me
it
would
be
doing
him
a
very
bad
service
my
dear
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
truth
in
any
of
these
respects
i
felt
of
course
that
we
must
admit
not
only
to
ourselves
but
to
others
the
full
force
of
the
circumstances
against
him
yet
i
knew
withal
i
could
not
help
saying
that
their
weight
would
not
induce
us
to
desert
him
in
his
need
heaven
forbid
returned
my
guardian
we
will
stand
by
him
as
he
himself
stood
by
the
two
poor
creatures
who
are
gone
he
meant
gridley
and
the
boy
to
both
of
whom
george
had
given
shelter
woodcourt
then
told
us
that
the
trooper
man
had
been
with
him
before
day
after
wandering
about
the
streets
all
night
like
a
distracted
creature
that
one
of
the
trooper
first
anxieties
was
that
we
should
not
suppose
him
guilty
that
he
had
charged
his
messenger
to
represent
his
perfect
innocence
with
every
solemn
assurance
he
could
send
us
that
woodcourt
had
only
quieted
the
man
by
undertaking
to
come
to
our
house
very
early
in
the
morning
with
these
representations
he
added
that
he
was
now
upon
his
way
to
see
the
prisoner
himself
my
guardian
said
directly
he
would
go
too
now
besides
that
i
liked
the
retired
soldier
very
much
and
that
he
liked
me
i
had
that
secret
interest
in
what
had
happened
which
was
only
known
to
my
guardian
i
felt
as
if
it
came
close
and
near
to
me
it
seemed
to
become
personally
important
to
myself
that
the
truth
should
be
discovered
and
that
no
innocent
people
should
be
suspected
for
suspicion
once
run
wild
might
run
wilder
in
a
word
i
felt
as
if
it
were
my
duty
and
obligation
to
go
with
them
my
guardian
did
not
seek
to
dissuade
me
and
i
went
it
was
a
large
prison
with
many
courts
and
passages
so
like
one
another
and
so
uniformly
paved
that
i
seemed
to
gain
a
new
comprehension
as
i
passed
along
of
the
fondness
that
solitary
prisoners
shut
up
among
the
same
staring
walls
from
year
to
year
have
had
as
i
have
read
for
a
weed
or
a
stray
blade
of
grass
in
an
arched
room
by
himself
like
a
cellar
upstairs
with
walls
so
glaringly
white
that
they
made
the
massive
iron
and
door
even
more
profoundly
black
than
they
were
we
found
the
trooper
standing
in
a
corner
he
had
been
sitting
on
a
bench
there
and
had
risen
when
he
heard
the
locks
and
bolts
turn
when
he
saw
us
he
came
forward
a
step
with
his
usual
heavy
tread
and
there
stopped
and
made
a
slight
bow
but
as
i
still
advanced
putting
out
my
hand
to
him
he
understood
us
in
a
moment
this
is
a
load
off
my
mind
i
do
assure
you
miss
and
gentlemen
said
he
saluting
us
with
great
heartiness
and
drawing
a
long
breath
and
now
i
do
so
much
care
how
it
ends
he
scarcely
seemed
to
be
the
prisoner
what
with
his
coolness
and
his
soldierly
bearing
he
looked
far
more
like
the
prison
guard
this
is
even
a
rougher
place
than
my
gallery
to
receive
a
lady
in
said
george
but
i
know
miss
summerson
will
make
the
best
of
it
as
he
handed
me
to
the
bench
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
i
sat
down
which
seemed
to
give
him
great
satisfaction
i
thank
you
miss
said
he
now
george
observed
my
guardian
as
we
require
no
new
assurances
on
your
part
so
i
believe
we
need
give
you
none
on
ours
not
at
all
sir
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
if
i
was
not
innocent
of
this
crime
i
could
look
at
you
and
keep
my
secret
to
myself
under
the
condescension
of
the
present
visit
i
feel
the
present
visit
very
much
i
am
not
one
of
the
eloquent
sort
but
i
feel
it
miss
summerson
and
gentlemen
deeply
he
laid
his
hand
for
a
moment
on
his
broad
chest
and
bent
his
head
to
us
although
he
squared
himself
again
directly
he
expressed
a
great
amount
of
natural
emotion
by
these
simple
means
first
said
my
guardian
can
we
do
anything
for
your
personal
comfort
george
for
which
sir
he
inquired
clearing
his
throat
for
your
personal
comfort
is
there
anything
you
want
that
would
lessen
the
hardship
of
this
confinement
well
sir
replied
george
after
a
little
cogitation
i
am
equally
obliged
to
you
but
tobacco
being
against
the
rules
i
ca
say
that
there
is
you
will
think
of
many
little
things
perhaps
by
and
by
whenever
you
do
george
let
us
know
thank
you
sir
howsoever
observed
george
with
one
of
his
sunburnt
smiles
a
man
who
has
been
knocking
about
the
world
in
a
vagabond
kind
of
a
way
as
long
as
i
have
gets
on
well
enough
in
a
place
like
the
present
so
far
as
that
goes
next
as
to
your
case
observed
my
guardian
exactly
so
sir
returned
george
folding
his
arms
upon
his
breast
with
perfect
and
a
little
curiosity
how
does
it
stand
now
why
sir
it
is
under
remand
at
present
bucket
gives
me
to
understand
that
he
will
probably
apply
for
a
series
of
remands
from
time
to
time
until
the
case
is
more
complete
how
it
is
to
be
made
more
complete
i
do
myself
see
but
i
dare
say
bucket
will
manage
it
somehow
why
heaven
save
us
man
exclaimed
my
guardian
surprised
into
his
old
oddity
and
vehemence
you
talk
of
yourself
as
if
you
were
somebody
else
no
offence
sir
said
george
i
am
very
sensible
of
your
kindness
but
i
do
see
how
an
innocent
man
is
to
make
up
his
mind
to
this
kind
of
thing
without
knocking
his
head
against
the
walls
unless
he
takes
it
in
that
point
of
view
that
is
true
enough
to
a
certain
extent
returned
my
guardian
softened
but
my
good
fellow
even
an
innocent
man
must
take
ordinary
precautions
to
defend
himself
certainly
sir
and
i
have
done
so
i
have
stated
to
the
magistrates
i
am
as
innocent
of
this
charge
as
yourselves
what
has
been
stated
against
me
in
the
way
of
facts
is
perfectly
true
i
know
no
more
about
it
i
intend
to
continue
stating
that
sir
what
more
can
i
do
it
the
truth
but
the
mere
truth
wo
do
rejoined
my
guardian
wo
it
indeed
sir
rather
a
bad
for
me
george
observed
you
must
have
a
lawyer
pursued
my
guardian
we
must
engage
a
good
one
for
you
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
said
george
with
a
step
backward
i
am
equally
obliged
but
i
must
decidedly
beg
to
be
excused
from
anything
of
that
sort
you
wo
have
a
lawyer
no
sir
george
shook
his
head
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
i
thank
you
all
the
same
sir
but
no
lawyer
why
not
i
do
take
kindly
to
the
breed
said
george
gridley
did
and
if
you
excuse
my
saying
so
much
i
should
hardly
have
thought
you
did
yourself
sir
that
equity
my
guardian
explained
a
little
at
a
loss
equity
george
is
it
indeed
sir
returned
the
trooper
in
his
manner
i
am
not
acquainted
with
those
shades
of
names
myself
but
in
a
general
way
i
object
to
the
breed
unfolding
his
arms
and
changing
his
position
he
stood
with
one
massive
hand
upon
the
table
and
the
other
on
his
hip
as
complete
a
picture
of
a
man
who
was
not
to
be
moved
from
a
fixed
purpose
as
ever
i
saw
it
was
in
vain
that
we
all
three
talked
to
him
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
he
listened
with
that
gentleness
which
went
so
well
with
his
bluff
bearing
but
was
evidently
no
more
shaken
by
our
representations
that
his
place
of
confinement
was
pray
think
once
more
george
said
i
have
you
no
wish
in
reference
to
your
case
i
certainly
could
wish
it
to
be
tried
miss
he
returned
by
but
that
is
out
of
the
question
as
i
am
well
aware
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
favour
me
with
your
attention
for
a
couple
of
minutes
miss
not
more
i
endeavour
to
explain
myself
as
clearly
as
i
can
he
looked
at
us
all
three
in
turn
shook
his
head
a
little
as
if
he
were
adjusting
it
in
the
stock
and
collar
of
a
tight
uniform
and
after
a
moment
reflection
went
on
you
see
miss
i
have
been
handcuffed
and
taken
into
custody
and
brought
here
i
am
a
marked
and
disgraced
man
and
here
i
am
my
shooting
gallery
is
rummaged
high
and
low
by
bucket
such
property
as
i
have
is
small
is
turned
this
way
and
that
till
it
do
know
itself
and
as
aforesaid
here
i
am
i
do
particular
complain
of
that
though
i
am
in
these
present
quarters
through
no
immediately
preceding
fault
of
mine
i
can
very
well
understand
that
if
i
gone
into
the
vagabond
way
in
my
youth
this
would
have
happened
it
has
happened
then
comes
the
question
how
to
meet
it
he
rubbed
his
swarthy
forehead
for
a
moment
with
a
look
and
said
apologetically
i
am
such
a
talker
that
i
must
think
a
bit
having
thought
a
bit
he
looked
up
again
and
resumed
how
to
meet
it
now
the
unfortunate
deceased
was
himself
a
lawyer
and
had
a
pretty
tight
hold
of
me
i
do
wish
to
rake
up
his
ashes
but
he
had
what
i
should
call
if
he
was
living
a
devil
of
a
tight
hold
of
me
i
do
like
his
trade
the
better
for
that
if
i
had
kept
clear
of
his
trade
i
should
have
kept
outside
this
place
but
not
what
i
mean
now
suppose
i
had
killed
him
suppose
i
really
had
discharged
into
his
body
any
one
of
those
pistols
recently
fired
off
that
bucket
has
found
at
my
place
and
dear
me
might
have
found
there
any
day
since
it
has
been
my
place
what
should
i
have
done
as
soon
as
i
was
hard
and
fast
here
got
a
lawyer
he
stopped
on
hearing
some
one
at
the
locks
and
bolts
and
did
not
resume
until
the
door
had
been
opened
and
was
shut
again
for
what
purpose
opened
i
will
mention
presently
i
should
have
got
a
lawyer
and
he
would
have
said
as
i
have
often
read
in
the
newspapers
client
says
nothing
my
client
reserves
his
defence
my
client
this
that
and
well
is
not
the
custom
of
that
breed
to
go
straight
according
to
my
opinion
or
to
think
that
other
men
do
say
i
am
innocent
and
i
get
a
lawyer
he
would
be
as
likely
to
believe
me
guilty
as
not
perhaps
more
what
would
he
do
whether
or
not
act
as
if
i
was
shut
my
mouth
up
tell
me
not
to
commit
myself
keep
circumstances
back
chop
the
evidence
small
quibble
and
get
me
off
perhaps
but
miss
summerson
do
i
care
for
getting
off
in
that
way
or
would
i
rather
be
hanged
in
my
own
way
if
you
excuse
my
mentioning
anything
so
disagreeable
to
a
lady
he
had
warmed
into
his
subject
now
and
was
under
no
further
necessity
to
wait
a
bit
i
would
rather
be
hanged
in
my
own
way
and
i
mean
to
be
i
intend
to
say
looking
round
upon
us
with
his
powerful
arms
akimbo
and
his
dark
eyebrows
raised
that
i
am
more
partial
to
being
hanged
than
another
man
what
i
say
is
i
must
come
off
clear
and
full
or
not
at
all
therefore
when
i
hear
stated
against
me
what
is
true
i
say
it
true
and
when
they
tell
me
you
say
will
be
used
i
tell
them
i
do
mind
that
i
mean
it
to
be
used
if
they
ca
make
me
innocent
out
of
the
whole
truth
they
are
not
likely
to
do
it
out
of
anything
less
or
anything
else
and
if
they
are
worth
nothing
to
me
taking
a
pace
or
two
over
the
stone
floor
he
came
back
to
the
table
and
finished
what
he
had
to
say
i
thank
you
miss
and
gentlemen
both
many
times
for
your
attention
and
many
times
more
for
your
interest
that
the
plain
state
of
the
matter
as
it
points
itself
out
to
a
mere
trooper
with
a
blunt
broadsword
kind
of
a
mind
i
have
never
done
well
in
life
beyond
my
duty
as
a
soldier
and
if
the
worst
comes
after
all
i
shall
reap
pretty
much
as
i
have
sown
when
i
got
over
the
first
crash
of
being
seized
as
a
murderer
it
do
take
a
rover
who
has
knocked
about
so
much
as
myself
so
very
long
to
recover
from
a
crash
i
worked
my
way
round
to
what
you
find
me
now
as
such
i
shall
remain
no
relations
will
be
disgraced
by
me
or
made
unhappy
for
me
and
and
that
all
i
got
to
say
the
door
had
been
opened
to
admit
another
man
of
less
prepossessing
appearance
at
first
sight
and
a
wholesome
woman
with
a
basket
who
from
her
entrance
had
been
exceedingly
attentive
to
all
george
had
said
george
had
received
them
with
a
familiar
nod
and
a
friendly
look
but
without
any
more
particular
greeting
in
the
midst
of
his
address
he
now
shook
them
cordially
by
the
hand
and
said
miss
summerson
and
gentlemen
this
is
an
old
comrade
of
mine
matthew
bagnet
and
this
is
his
wife
mrs
bagnet
bagnet
made
us
a
stiff
military
bow
and
bagnet
dropped
us
a
curtsy
real
good
friends
of
mine
they
are
sald
george
it
was
at
their
house
i
was
taken
with
a
wiolinceller
bagnet
put
in
twitching
his
head
angrily
of
a
good
tone
for
a
friend
that
money
was
no
object
to
mat
said
george
you
have
heard
pretty
well
all
i
have
been
saying
to
this
lady
and
these
two
gentlemen
i
know
it
meets
your
approval
bagnet
after
considering
referred
the
point
to
his
wife
old
girl
said
he
tell
him
whether
or
not
it
meets
my
approval
why
george
exclaimed
bagnet
who
had
been
unpacking
her
basket
in
which
there
was
a
piece
of
cold
pickled
pork
a
little
tea
and
sugar
and
a
brown
loaf
you
ought
to
know
it
do
you
ought
to
know
it
enough
to
drive
a
person
wild
to
hear
you
you
wo
be
got
off
this
way
and
you
wo
be
got
off
that
way
what
do
you
mean
by
such
picking
and
choosing
it
stuff
and
nonsense
george
do
be
severe
upon
me
in
my
misfortunes
bagnet
said
the
trooper
lightly
oh
bother
your
misfortunes
cried
bagnet
if
they
do
make
you
more
reasonable
than
that
comes
to
i
never
was
so
ashamed
in
my
life
to
hear
a
man
talk
folly
as
i
have
been
to
hear
you
talk
this
day
to
the
present
company
lawyers
why
what
but
too
many
cooks
should
hinder
you
from
having
a
dozen
lawyers
if
the
gentleman
recommended
them
to
you
this
is
a
very
sensible
woman
said
my
guardian
i
hope
you
will
persuade
him
mrs
bagnet
persuade
him
sir
she
returned
lord
bless
you
no
you
know
george
now
there
bagnet
left
her
basket
to
point
him
out
with
both
her
bare
brown
hands
there
he
stands
as
and
as
determined
a
man
in
the
wrong
way
as
ever
put
a
human
creature
under
heaven
out
of
patience
you
could
as
soon
take
up
and
shoulder
an
eight
and
forty
pounder
by
your
own
strength
as
turn
that
man
when
he
has
got
a
thing
into
his
head
and
fixed
it
there
why
do
i
know
him
cried
bagnet
do
i
know
you
george
you
do
mean
to
set
up
for
a
new
character
with
me
after
all
these
years
i
hope
her
friendly
indignation
had
an
exemplary
effect
upon
her
husband
who
shook
his
head
at
the
trooper
several
times
as
a
silent
recommendation
to
him
to
yield
between
whiles
bagnet
looked
at
me
and
i
understood
from
the
play
of
her
eyes
that
she
wished
me
to
do
something
though
i
did
not
comprehend
what
but
i
have
given
up
talking
to
you
old
fellow
years
and
years
said
bagnet
as
she
blew
a
little
dust
off
the
pickled
pork
looking
at
me
again
and
when
ladies
and
gentlemen
know
you
as
well
as
i
do
they
give
up
talking
to
you
too
if
you
are
not
too
headstrong
to
accept
of
a
bit
of
dinner
here
it
is
i
accept
it
with
many
thanks
returned
the
trooper
do
you
though
indeed
said
bagnet
continuing
to
grumble
on
i
sure
i
surprised
at
that
i
wonder
you
starve
in
your
own
way
also
it
would
only
be
like
you
perhaps
you
set
your
mind
upon
that
next
here
she
again
looked
at
me
and
i
now
perceived
from
her
glances
at
the
door
and
at
me
by
turns
that
she
wished
us
to
retire
and
to
await
her
following
us
outside
the
prison
communicating
this
by
similar
means
to
my
guardian
and
woodcourt
i
rose
we
hope
you
will
think
better
of
it
george
said
i
and
we
shall
come
to
see
you
again
trusting
to
find
you
more
reasonable
more
grateful
miss
summerson
you
ca
find
me
he
returned
but
more
persuadable
we
can
i
hope
said
i
and
let
me
entreat
you
to
consider
that
the
clearing
up
of
this
mystery
and
the
discovery
of
the
real
perpetrator
of
this
deed
may
be
of
the
last
importance
to
others
besides
yourself
he
heard
me
respectfully
but
without
much
heeding
these
words
which
i
spoke
a
little
turned
from
him
already
on
my
way
to
the
door
he
was
observing
this
they
afterwards
told
me
my
height
and
figure
which
seemed
to
catch
his
attention
all
at
once
is
curious
said
he
and
yet
i
thought
so
at
the
time
my
guardian
asked
him
what
he
meant
why
sir
he
answered
when
my
ill
fortune
took
me
to
the
dead
man
staircase
on
the
night
of
his
murder
i
saw
a
shape
so
like
miss
summerson
go
by
me
in
the
dark
that
i
had
half
a
mind
to
speak
to
it
for
an
instant
i
felt
such
a
shudder
as
i
never
felt
before
or
since
and
hope
i
shall
never
feel
again
it
came
downstairs
as
i
went
up
said
the
trooper
and
crossed
the
moonlighted
window
with
a
loose
black
mantle
on
i
noticed
a
deep
fringe
to
it
however
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
subject
excepting
that
miss
summerson
looked
so
like
it
at
the
moment
that
it
came
into
my
head
i
can
not
separate
and
define
the
feelings
that
arose
in
me
after
this
it
is
enough
that
the
vague
duty
and
obligation
i
had
felt
upon
me
from
the
first
of
following
the
investigation
was
without
my
distinctly
daring
to
ask
myself
any
question
increased
and
that
i
was
indignantly
sure
of
there
being
no
possibility
of
a
reason
for
my
being
afraid
we
three
went
out
of
the
prison
and
walked
up
and
down
at
some
short
distance
from
the
gate
which
was
in
a
retired
place
we
had
not
waited
long
when
and
bagnet
came
out
too
and
quickly
joined
us
there
was
a
tear
in
each
of
bagnet
eyes
and
her
face
was
flushed
and
hurried
i
did
let
george
see
what
i
thought
about
it
you
know
miss
was
her
first
remark
when
she
came
up
but
in
a
bad
way
poor
old
fellow
not
with
care
and
prudence
and
good
help
said
my
guardian
a
gentleman
like
you
ought
to
know
best
sir
returned
bagnet
hurriedly
drying
her
eyes
on
the
hem
of
her
grey
cloak
but
i
am
uneasy
for
him
he
has
been
so
careless
and
said
so
much
that
he
never
meant
the
gentlemen
of
the
juries
might
not
understand
him
as
lignum
and
me
do
and
then
such
a
number
of
circumstances
have
happened
bad
for
him
and
such
a
number
of
people
will
be
brought
forward
to
speak
against
him
and
bucket
is
so
deep
with
a
wiolinceller
and
said
he
played
the
fife
when
a
boy
bagnet
added
with
great
solemnity
now
i
tell
you
miss
said
bagnet
and
when
i
say
miss
i
mean
all
just
come
into
the
corner
of
the
wall
and
i
tell
you
bagnet
hurried
us
into
a
more
secluded
place
and
was
at
first
too
breathless
to
proceed
occasioning
bagnet
to
say
old
girl
tell
why
then
miss
the
old
girl
proceeded
untying
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
for
more
air
you
could
as
soon
move
dover
castle
as
move
george
on
this
point
unless
you
had
got
a
new
power
to
move
him
with
and
i
have
got
it
you
are
a
jewel
of
a
woman
said
my
guardian
go
on
now
i
tell
you
miss
she
proceeded
clapping
her
hands
in
her
hurry
and
agitation
a
dozen
times
in
every
sentence
that
what
he
says
concerning
no
relations
is
all
bosh
they
do
know
of
him
but
he
does
know
of
them
he
has
said
more
to
me
at
odd
times
than
to
anybody
else
and
it
war
for
nothing
that
he
once
spoke
to
my
woolwich
about
whitening
and
wrinkling
mothers
heads
for
fifty
pounds
he
had
seen
his
mother
that
day
she
alive
and
must
be
brought
here
straight
instantly
bagnet
put
some
pins
into
her
mouth
and
began
pinning
up
her
skirts
all
round
a
little
higher
than
the
level
of
her
grey
cloak
which
she
accomplished
with
surpassing
dispatch
and
dexterity
lignum
said
bagnet
you
take
care
of
the
children
old
man
and
give
me
the
umbrella
i
away
to
lincolnshire
to
bring
that
old
lady
here
but
bless
the
woman
cried
my
guardian
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
how
is
she
going
what
money
has
she
got
bagnet
made
another
application
to
her
skirts
and
brought
forth
a
leathern
purse
in
which
she
hastily
counted
over
a
few
shillings
and
which
she
then
shut
up
with
perfect
satisfaction
never
you
mind
for
me
miss
i
a
soldier
wife
and
accustomed
to
travel
my
own
way
lignum
old
boy
kissing
him
one
for
yourself
three
for
the
children
now
i
away
into
lincolnshire
after
mother
and
she
actually
set
off
while
we
three
stood
looking
at
one
another
lost
in
amazement
she
actually
trudged
away
in
her
grey
cloak
at
a
sturdy
pace
and
turned
the
corner
and
was
gone
bagnet
said
my
guardian
do
you
mean
to
let
her
go
in
that
way
ca
help
it
he
returned
made
her
way
home
once
from
another
quarter
of
the
world
with
the
same
grey
cloak
and
same
umbrella
whatever
the
old
girl
says
do
do
it
whenever
the
old
girl
says
i
do
it
she
does
it
then
she
is
as
honest
and
genuine
as
she
looks
rejoined
my
guardian
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
more
for
her
she
of
the
nonpareil
battalion
said
bagnet
looking
at
us
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
his
way
also
and
not
such
another
but
i
never
own
to
it
before
her
discipline
must
be
maintained
chapter
liii
the
track
bucket
and
his
fat
forefinger
are
much
in
consultation
together
under
existing
circumstances
when
bucket
has
a
matter
of
this
pressing
interest
under
his
consideration
the
fat
forefinger
seems
to
rise
to
the
dignity
of
a
familiar
demon
he
puts
it
to
his
ears
and
it
whispers
information
he
puts
it
to
his
lips
and
it
enjoins
him
to
secrecy
he
rubs
it
over
his
nose
and
it
sharpens
his
scent
he
shakes
it
before
a
guilty
man
and
it
charms
him
to
his
destruction
the
augurs
of
the
detective
temple
invariably
predict
that
when
bucket
and
that
finger
are
in
much
conference
a
terrible
avenger
will
be
heard
of
before
long
otherwise
mildly
studious
in
his
observation
of
human
nature
on
the
whole
a
benignant
philosopher
not
disposed
to
be
severe
upon
the
follies
of
mankind
bucket
pervades
a
vast
number
of
houses
and
strolls
about
an
infinity
of
streets
to
outward
appearance
rather
languishing
for
want
of
an
object
he
is
in
the
friendliest
condition
towards
his
species
and
will
drink
with
most
of
them
he
is
free
with
his
money
affable
in
his
manners
innocent
in
his
conversation
but
through
the
placid
stream
of
his
life
there
glides
an
of
forefinger
time
and
place
can
not
bind
bucket
like
man
in
the
abstract
he
is
here
and
gone
but
very
unlike
man
indeed
he
is
here
again
the
next
day
this
evening
he
will
be
casually
looking
into
the
iron
extinguishers
at
the
door
of
sir
leicester
house
in
town
and
morning
he
will
be
walking
on
the
leads
at
chesney
wold
where
erst
the
old
man
walked
whose
ghost
is
propitiated
with
a
hundred
guineas
drawers
desks
pockets
all
things
belonging
to
him
bucket
examines
a
few
hours
afterwards
he
and
the
roman
will
be
alone
together
comparing
forefingers
it
is
likely
that
these
occupations
are
irreconcilable
with
home
enjoyment
but
it
is
certain
that
bucket
at
present
does
not
go
home
though
in
general
he
highly
appreciates
the
society
of
bucket
a
lady
of
a
natural
detective
genius
which
if
it
had
been
improved
by
professional
exercise
might
have
done
great
things
but
which
has
paused
at
the
level
of
a
clever
amateur
he
holds
himself
aloof
from
that
dear
solace
bucket
is
dependent
on
their
lodger
fortunately
an
amiable
lady
in
whom
she
takes
an
interest
for
companionship
and
conversation
a
great
crowd
assembles
in
lincoln
inn
fields
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
sir
leicester
dedlock
attends
the
ceremony
in
person
strictly
speaking
there
are
only
three
other
human
followers
that
is
to
say
lord
doodle
william
buffy
and
the
debilitated
cousin
thrown
in
as
a
but
the
amount
of
inconsolable
carriages
is
immense
the
peerage
contributes
more
affliction
than
has
ever
been
seen
in
that
neighbourhood
such
is
the
assemblage
of
armorial
bearings
on
coach
panels
that
the
college
might
be
supposed
to
have
lost
its
father
and
mother
at
a
blow
the
duke
of
foodle
sends
a
splendid
pile
of
dust
and
ashes
with
silver
patent
axles
all
the
last
improvements
and
three
bereaved
worms
six
feet
high
holding
on
behind
in
a
bunch
of
woe
all
the
state
coachmen
in
london
seem
plunged
into
mourning
and
if
that
dead
old
man
of
the
rusty
garb
be
not
beyond
a
taste
in
horseflesh
which
appears
impossible
it
must
be
highly
gratified
this
day
quiet
among
the
undertakers
and
the
equipages
and
the
calves
of
so
many
legs
all
steeped
in
grief
bucket
sits
concealed
in
one
of
the
inconsolable
carriages
and
at
his
ease
surveys
the
crowd
through
the
lattice
blinds
he
has
a
keen
eye
for
a
crowd
as
for
what
not
and
looking
here
and
there
now
from
this
side
of
the
carriage
now
from
the
other
now
up
at
the
house
windows
now
along
the
people
heads
nothing
escapes
him
and
there
you
are
my
partner
eh
says
bucket
to
himself
apostrophizing
bucket
stationed
by
his
favour
on
the
steps
of
the
deceased
house
and
so
you
are
and
so
you
are
and
very
well
indeed
you
are
looking
mrs
bucket
the
procession
has
not
started
yet
but
is
waiting
for
the
cause
of
its
assemblage
to
be
brought
out
bucket
in
the
foremost
emblazoned
carriage
uses
his
two
fat
forefingers
to
hold
the
lattice
a
hair
breadth
open
while
he
looks
and
it
says
a
great
deal
for
his
attachment
as
a
husband
that
he
is
still
occupied
with
b
there
you
are
my
partner
eh
he
murmuringly
repeats
and
our
lodger
with
you
i
taking
notice
of
you
bucket
i
hope
you
all
right
in
your
health
my
dear
not
another
word
does
bucket
say
but
sits
with
most
attentive
eyes
until
the
sacked
depository
of
noble
secrets
is
brought
down
where
are
all
those
secrets
now
does
he
keep
them
yet
did
they
fly
with
him
on
that
sudden
journey
and
until
the
procession
moves
and
bucket
view
is
changed
after
which
he
composes
himself
for
an
easy
ride
and
takes
note
of
the
fittings
of
the
carriage
in
case
he
should
ever
find
such
knowledge
useful
contrast
enough
between
tulkinghorn
shut
up
in
his
dark
carriage
and
bucket
shut
up
in
his
between
the
immeasurable
track
of
space
beyond
the
little
wound
that
has
thrown
the
one
into
the
fixed
sleep
which
jolts
so
heavily
over
the
stones
of
the
streets
and
the
narrow
track
of
blood
which
keeps
the
other
in
the
watchful
state
expressed
in
every
hair
of
his
head
but
it
is
all
one
to
both
neither
is
troubled
about
that
bucket
sits
out
the
procession
in
his
own
easy
manner
and
glides
from
the
carriage
when
the
opportunity
he
has
settled
with
himself
arrives
he
makes
for
sir
leicester
dedlock
which
is
at
present
a
sort
of
home
to
him
where
he
comes
and
goes
as
he
likes
at
all
hours
where
he
is
always
welcome
and
made
much
of
where
he
knows
the
whole
establishment
and
walks
in
an
atmosphere
of
mysterious
greatness
no
knocking
or
ringing
for
bucket
he
has
caused
himself
to
be
provided
with
a
key
and
can
pass
in
at
his
pleasure
as
he
is
crossing
the
hall
mercury
informs
him
here
another
letter
for
you
bucket
come
by
post
and
gives
it
him
another
one
eh
says
bucket
if
mercury
should
chance
to
be
possessed
by
any
lingering
curiosity
as
to
bucket
letters
that
wary
person
is
not
the
man
to
gratify
it
bucket
looks
at
him
as
if
his
face
were
a
vista
of
some
miles
in
length
and
he
were
leisurely
contemplating
the
same
do
you
happen
to
carry
a
box
says
bucket
unfortunately
mercury
is
no
could
you
fetch
me
a
pinch
from
anywheres
says
bucket
thankee
it
do
matter
what
it
is
i
not
particular
as
to
the
kind
thankee
having
leisurely
helped
himself
from
a
canister
borrowed
from
somebody
downstairs
for
the
purpose
and
having
made
a
considerable
show
of
tasting
it
first
with
one
side
of
his
nose
and
then
with
the
other
bucket
with
much
deliberation
pronounces
it
of
the
right
sort
and
goes
on
letter
in
hand
now
although
bucket
walks
upstairs
to
the
little
library
within
the
larger
one
with
the
face
of
a
man
who
receives
some
scores
of
letters
every
day
it
happens
that
much
correspondence
is
not
incidental
to
his
life
he
is
no
great
scribe
rather
handling
his
pen
like
the
he
carries
about
with
him
always
convenient
to
his
grasp
and
discourages
correspondence
with
himself
in
others
as
being
too
artless
and
direct
a
way
of
doing
delicate
business
further
he
often
sees
damaging
letters
produced
in
evidence
and
has
occasion
to
reflect
that
it
was
a
green
thing
to
write
them
for
these
reasons
he
has
very
little
to
do
with
letters
either
as
sender
or
receiver
and
yet
he
has
received
a
round
within
the
last
hours
and
this
says
bucket
spreading
it
out
on
the
table
is
in
the
same
hand
and
consists
of
the
same
two
words
what
two
words
he
turns
the
key
in
the
door
ungirdles
his
black
book
of
fate
to
many
lays
another
letter
by
it
and
reads
boldly
written
in
each
lady
dedlock
yes
yes
says
bucket
but
i
could
have
made
the
money
without
this
anonymous
information
having
put
the
letters
in
his
book
of
fate
and
girdled
it
up
again
he
unlocks
the
door
just
in
time
to
admit
his
dinner
which
is
brought
upon
a
goodly
tray
with
a
decanter
of
sherry
bucket
frequently
observes
in
friendly
circles
where
there
is
no
restraint
that
he
likes
a
toothful
of
your
fine
old
brown
east
inder
sherry
better
than
anything
you
can
offer
him
consequently
he
fills
and
empties
his
glass
with
a
smack
of
his
lips
and
is
proceeding
with
his
refreshment
when
an
idea
enters
his
mind
bucket
softly
opens
the
door
of
communication
between
that
room
and
the
next
and
looks
in
the
library
is
deserted
and
the
fire
is
sinking
low
bucket
eye
after
taking
a
round
the
room
alights
upon
a
table
where
letters
are
usually
put
as
they
arrive
several
letters
for
sir
leicester
are
upon
it
bucket
draws
near
and
examines
the
directions
no
he
says
there
none
in
that
hand
it
only
me
as
is
written
to
i
can
break
it
to
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
with
that
he
returns
to
finish
his
dinner
with
a
good
appetite
and
after
a
light
nap
is
summoned
into
the
sir
leicester
has
received
him
there
these
several
evenings
past
to
know
whether
he
has
anything
to
report
the
debilitated
cousin
much
exhausted
by
the
funeral
and
volumnia
are
in
attendance
bucket
makes
three
distinctly
different
bows
to
these
three
people
a
bow
of
homage
to
sir
leicester
a
bow
of
gallantry
to
volumnia
and
a
bow
of
recognition
to
the
debilitated
cousin
to
whom
it
airily
says
you
are
a
swell
about
town
and
you
know
me
and
i
know
you
having
distributed
these
little
specimens
of
his
tact
bucket
rubs
his
hands
have
you
anything
new
to
communicate
officer
inquires
sir
leicester
do
you
wish
to
hold
any
conversation
with
me
in
private
why
not
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
because
my
time
pursues
sir
leicester
is
wholly
at
your
disposal
with
a
view
to
the
vindication
of
the
outraged
majesty
of
the
law
bucket
coughs
and
glances
at
volumnia
rouged
and
necklaced
as
though
he
would
respectfully
observe
i
do
assure
you
you
a
pretty
creetur
i
seen
hundreds
worse
looking
at
your
time
of
life
i
have
indeed
the
fair
volumnia
not
quite
unconscious
perhaps
of
the
humanizing
influence
of
her
charms
pauses
in
the
writing
of
notes
and
meditatively
adjusts
the
pearl
necklace
bucket
prices
that
decoration
in
his
mind
and
thinks
it
as
likely
as
not
that
volumnia
is
writing
poetry
if
i
have
not
pursues
sir
leicester
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
adjured
you
officer
to
exercise
your
utmost
skill
in
this
atrocious
case
i
particularly
desire
to
take
the
present
opportunity
of
rectifying
any
omission
i
may
have
made
let
no
expense
be
a
consideration
i
am
prepared
to
defray
all
charges
you
can
incur
none
in
pursuit
of
the
object
you
have
undertaken
that
i
shall
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
bear
bucket
made
sir
leicester
bow
again
as
a
response
to
this
liberality
my
mind
sir
leicester
adds
with
a
generous
warmth
has
not
as
may
be
easily
supposed
recovered
its
tone
since
the
late
diabolical
occurrence
it
is
not
likely
ever
to
recover
its
tone
but
it
is
full
of
indignation
after
undergoing
the
ordeal
of
consigning
to
the
tomb
the
remains
of
a
faithful
a
zealous
a
devoted
adherent
sir
leicester
voice
trembles
and
his
grey
hair
stirs
upon
his
head
tears
are
in
his
eyes
the
best
part
of
his
nature
is
aroused
i
declare
he
says
i
solemnly
declare
that
until
this
crime
is
discovered
and
in
the
course
of
justice
punished
i
almost
feel
as
if
there
were
a
stain
upon
my
name
a
gentleman
who
has
devoted
a
large
portion
of
his
life
to
me
a
gentleman
who
has
devoted
the
last
day
of
his
life
to
me
a
gentleman
who
has
constantly
sat
at
my
table
and
slept
under
my
roof
goes
from
my
house
to
his
own
and
is
struck
down
within
an
hour
of
his
leaving
my
house
i
can
not
say
but
that
he
may
have
been
followed
from
my
house
watched
at
my
house
even
first
marked
because
of
his
association
with
my
house
which
may
have
suggested
his
possessing
greater
wealth
and
being
altogether
of
greater
importance
than
his
own
retiring
demeanour
would
have
indicated
if
i
can
not
with
my
means
and
influence
and
my
position
bring
all
the
perpetrators
of
such
a
crime
to
light
i
fail
in
the
assertion
of
my
respect
for
that
gentleman
memory
and
of
my
fidelity
towards
one
who
was
ever
faithful
to
me
while
he
makes
this
protestation
with
great
emotion
and
earnestness
looking
round
the
room
as
if
he
were
addressing
an
assembly
bucket
glances
at
him
with
an
observant
gravity
in
which
there
might
be
but
for
the
audacity
of
the
thought
a
touch
of
compassion
the
ceremony
of
continues
sir
leicester
strikingly
illustrative
of
the
respect
in
which
my
deceased
friend
he
lays
a
stress
upon
the
word
for
death
levels
all
distinctions
was
held
by
the
flower
of
the
land
has
i
say
aggravated
the
shock
i
have
received
from
this
most
horrible
and
audacious
crime
if
it
were
my
brother
who
had
committed
it
i
would
not
spare
him
bucket
looks
very
grave
volumnia
remarks
of
the
deceased
that
he
was
the
trustiest
and
dearest
person
you
must
feel
it
as
a
deprivation
to
you
miss
replies
bucket
soothingly
no
doubt
he
was
calculated
to
be
a
deprivation
sure
he
was
volumnia
gives
bucket
to
understand
in
reply
that
her
sensitive
mind
is
fully
made
up
never
to
get
the
better
of
it
as
long
as
she
lives
that
her
nerves
are
unstrung
for
ever
and
that
she
has
not
the
least
expectation
of
ever
smiling
again
meanwhile
she
folds
up
a
cocked
hat
for
that
redoubtable
old
general
at
bath
descriptive
of
her
melancholy
condition
it
gives
a
start
to
a
delicate
female
says
bucket
sympathetically
but
it
wear
off

wishes
of
all
things
to
know
what
is
doing
whether
they
are
going
to
convict
or
whatever
it
is
that
dreadful
soldier
whether
he
had
any
accomplices
or
whatever
the
thing
is
called
in
the
law
and
a
great
deal
more
to
the
like
artless
purpose
why
you
see
miss
returns
bucket
bringing
the
finger
into
persuasive
action
and
such
is
his
natural
gallantry
that
he
had
almost
said
my
dear
it
ai
easy
to
answer
those
questions
at
the
present
moment
not
at
the
present
moment
i
kept
myself
on

dedlock

bucket
takes
into
the
conversation

right
of
his
importance
morning
noon
and
night
but
for

glass
or
two
of
sherry

my
mind
so
much
upon

stretch
as
it

been
i
could
answer
your
questions

sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet

soon

i
hope
that

you

says
bucket
with
a
complimentary
twinkle
of
his
eye
and
crook
of
his
finger
and
you
can
confirm
what
i
mentioned
to
this
lady

reddening
at

it
is
not
holding
up
a
good
model
for
imitation
to
ask
the
officer
any
such
questions
as
you
have
put
to
him
he
is
the
best
judge
of
his
own
responsibility
he
acts
upon
his
responsibility
and
it
does
not
become
us
who
assist
in
making
the
laws
to
impede
or
interfere
with
those
who
carry
them
into
execution
or
says
sir
leicester
somewhat
sternly
for
volumnia
was
going
to
cut
in
before
he
had
rounded
his
sentence
or
who
vindicate
their
outraged
majesty
volumnia
with
all
humility
explains
that
she
had
not
merely
the
plea
of
curiosity
to
urge
in
common
with
the
giddy
youth
of
her
sex
in
general
but
that
she
is
perfectly
dying
with
regret
and
interest
for
the
darling
man
whose
loss
they
all
deplore
very
well
volumnia
returns
sir
leicester
then
you
can
not
be
too
discreet
bucket
takes
the
opportunity
of
a
pause
to
be
heard
again
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
have
no
objections
to
telling
this
lady
with
your
leave
and
among
ourselves
that
i
look
upon
the
case
as
pretty
well
complete
it
is
a
beautiful
case
a
beautiful
case
and
what
little
is
wanting
to
complete
it
i
expect
to
be
able
to
supply
in
a
few
hours
i
am
very
glad
indeed
to
hear
it
says
sir
leicester
highly
creditable
to
you
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
returns
bucket
very
seriously
i
hope
it
may
at
one
and
the
same
time
do
me
credit
and
prove
satisfactory
to
all
when
i
depict
it
as
a
beautiful
case
you
see
miss
bucket
goes
on
glancing
gravely
at
sir
leicester
i
mean
from
my
point
of
view
as
considered
from
other
points
of
view
such
cases
will
always
involve
more
or
less
unpleasantness
very
strange
things
comes
to
our
knowledge
in
families
miss
bless
your
heart
what
you
would
think
to
be
phenomenons
quite
volumnia
with
her
innocent
little
scream
supposes
so
aye
and
even
in
families
in
high
families
in
great
families
says
bucket
again
gravely
eyeing
sir
leicester
aside
i
have
had
the
honour
of
being
employed
in
high
families
before
and
you
have
no
idea
come
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
not
even
you
have
any
idea
sir
this
to
the
debilitated
cousin
what
games
goes
on
the
cousin
who
has
been
casting
on
his
head
in
a
prostration
of
boredom
yawns
vayli
being
the
for
very
likely
sir
leicester
deeming
it
time
to
dismiss
the
officer
here
majestically
interposes
with
the
words
very
good
thank
you
and
also
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
implying
not
only
that
there
is
an
end
of
the
discourse
but
that
if
high
families
fall
into
low
habits
they
must
take
the
consequences
you
will
not
forget
officer
he
adds
with
condescension
that
i
am
at
your
disposal
when
you
please
bucket
still
grave
inquires
if
morning
now
would
suit
in
case
he
should
be
as
as
he
expects
to
be
sir
leicester
replies
all
times
are
alike
to
me
bucket
makes
his
three
bows
and
is
withdrawing
when
a
forgotten
point
occurs
to
him
might
i
ask
by
the
by
he
says
in
a
low
voice
cautiously
returning
who
posted
the
on
the
staircase
i
ordered
it
to
be
put
up
there
replies
sir
leicester
would
it
be
considered
a
liberty
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
if
i
was
to
ask
you
why
not
at
all
i
chose
it
as
a
conspicuous
part
of
the
house
i
think
it
can
not
be
too
prominently
kept
before
the
whole
establishment
i
wish
my
people
to
be
impressed
with
the
enormity
of
the
crime
the
determination
to
punish
it
and
the
hopelessness
of
escape
at
the
same
time
officer
if
you
in
your
better
knowledge
of
the
subject
see
any
objection
bucket
sees
none
now
the
bill
having
been
put
up
had
better
not
be
taken
down
repeating
his
three
bows
he
withdraws
closing
the
door
on
volumnia
little
scream
which
is
a
preliminary
to
her
remarking
that
that
charmingly
horrible
person
is
a
perfect
blue
chamber
in
his
fondness
for
society
and
his
adaptability
to
all
grades
bucket
is
presently
standing
before
the
bright
and
warm
on
the
early
winter
night
admiring
mercury
why
you
six
foot
two
i
suppose
says
bucket
three
says
mercury
are
you
so
much
but
then
you
see
you
broad
in
proportion
and
do
look
it
you
not
one
of
the
ones
you
ai
was
you
ever
modelled
now
bucket
asks
conveying
the
expression
of
an
artist
into
the
turn
of
his
eye
and
head
mercury
never
was
modelled
then
you
ought
to
be
you
know
says
bucket
and
a
friend
of
mine
that
you
hear
of
one
day
as
a
royal
academy
sculptor
would
stand
something
handsome
to
make
a
drawing
of
your
proportions
for
the
marble
my
lady
out
ai
she
out
to
dinner
goes
out
pretty
well
every
day
do
she
yes
not
to
be
wondered
at
says
bucket
such
a
fine
woman
as
her
so
handsome
and
so
graceful
and
so
elegant
is
like
a
fresh
lemon
on
a
ornamental
wherever
she
goes
was
your
father
in
the
same
way
of
life
as
yourself
answer
in
the
negative
mine
was

bucket
my
father
was
first
a
page
then
a
footman
then
a
butler
then
a
steward
then
an

universally
respected
and
died
lamented
said
with
his
last
breath
that
he
considered
service
the
most
honourable
part
of
his
career
and
so
it
was
i
a
brother
in
service
and
a
my
lady
a
good
temper
mercury
replies
as
good
as
you
can
expect
ah
says
bucket
a
little
spoilt
a
little
capricious
lord
what
can
you
anticipate
when
they
so
handsome
as
that
and
we
like
all
the
better
for
it
do
we
mercury
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
bright
stretches
his
symmetrical
silk
legs
with
the
air
of
a
man
of
gallantry
and
ca
deny
it
come
the
roll
of
wheels
and
a
violent
ringing
at
the
bell
talk
of
the
angels
says
bucket
here
she
is
the
doors
are
thrown
open
and
she
passes
through
the
hall
still
very
pale
she
is
dressed
in
slight
mourning
and
wears
two
beautiful
bracelets
either
their
beauty
or
the
beauty
of
her
arms
is
particularly
attractive
to
bucket
he
looks
at
them
with
an
eager
eye
and
rattles
something
in
his
pocket
halfpence
perhaps
noticing
him
at
his
distance
she
turns
an
inquiring
look
on
the
other
mercury
who
has
brought
her
home
bucket
my
lady
bucket
makes
a
leg
and
comes
forward
passing
his
familiar
demon
over
the
region
of
his
mouth
are
you
waiting
to
see
sir
leicester
no
my
lady
i
seen
him
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
not
just
at
present
my
lady
have
you
made
any
new
discoveries
a
few
my
lady
this
is
merely
in
passing
she
scarcely
makes
a
stop
and
sweeps
upstairs
alone
bucket
moving
towards
the
watches
her
as
she
goes
up
the
steps
the
old
man
came
down
to
his
grave
past
murderous
groups
of
statuary
repeated
with
their
shadowy
weapons
on
the
wall
past
the
printed
bill
which
she
looks
at
going
by
out
of
view
she
a
lovely
woman
too
she
really
is
says
bucket
coming
back
to
mercury
do
look
quite
healthy
though
is
not
quite
healthy
mercury
informs
him
suffers
much
from
headaches
really
that
a
pity
walking
bucket
would
recommend
for
that
well
she
tries
walking
mercury
rejoins
walks
sometimes
for
two
hours
when
she
has
them
bad
by
night
too
are
you
sure
you
quite
so
much
as
six
foot
three
asks
bucket
begging
your
pardon
for
interrupting
you
a
moment
not
a
doubt
about
it
you
so
well
put
together
that
i
should
have
thought
it
but
the
household
troops
though
considered
fine
men
are
built
so
straggling
walks
by
night
does
she
when
it
moonlight
though
oh
yes
when
it
moonlight
of
course
oh
of
course
conversational
and
acquiescent
on
both
sides
i
suppose
you
ai
in
the
habit
of
walking
yourself
says
bucket
not
much
time
for
it
i
should
say
besides
which
mercury
do
like
it
prefers
carriage
exercise
to
be
sure
says
bucket
that
makes
a
difference
now
i
think
of
it
says
bucket
warming
his
hands
and
looking
pleasantly
at
the
blaze
she
went
out
walking
the
very
night
of
this
business
to
be
sure
she
did
i
let
her
into
the
garden
over
the
way
and
left
her
there
certainly
you
did
i
saw
you
doing
it
i
did
see
you
says
mercury
i
was
rather
in
a
hurry
returns
bucket
for
i
was
going
to
visit
a
aunt
of
mine
that
lives
at
chelsea
next
door
but
two
to
the
old
original
bun
house
ninety
year
old
the
old
lady
is
a
single
woman
and
got
a
little
property
yes
i
chanced
to
be
passing
at
the
time
let
see
what
time
might
it
be
it
was
ten
nine
you
right
so
it
was
and
if
i
do
deceive
myself
my
lady
was
muffled
in
a
loose
black
mantle
with
a
deep
fringe
to
it
of
course
she
was
of
course
she
was
bucket
must
return
to
a
little
work
he
has
to
get
on
with
upstairs
but
he
must
shake
hands
with
mercury
in
acknowledgment
of
his
agreeable
conversation
and
will
he
this
is
all
he
asks
will
he
when
he
has
a
leisure
think
of
bestowing
it
on
that
royal
academy
sculptor
for
the
advantage
of
both
parties
chapter
liv
springing
a
mine
refreshed
by
sleep
bucket
rises
betimes
in
the
morning
and
prepares
for
a
smartened
up
by
the
aid
of
a
clean
shirt
and
a
wet
hairbrush
with
which
instrument
on
occasions
of
ceremony
he
lubricates
such
thin
locks
as
remain
to
him
after
his
life
of
severe
study
bucket
lays
in
a
breakfast
of
two
mutton
chops
as
a
foundation
to
work
upon
together
with
tea
eggs
toast
and
marmalade
on
a
corresponding
scale
having
much
enjoyed
these
strengthening
matters
and
having
held
subtle
conference
with
his
familiar
demon
he
confidently
instructs
mercury
just
to
mention
quietly
to
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
that
whenever
he
ready
for
me
i
ready
for
him
a
gracious
message
being
returned
that
sir
leicester
will
expedite
his
dressing
and
join
bucket
in
the
library
within
ten
minutes
bucket
repairs
to
that
apartment
and
stands
before
the
fire
with
his
finger
on
his
chin
looking
at
the
blazing
coals
thoughtful
bucket
is
as
a
man
may
be
with
weighty
work
to
do
but
composed
sure
confident
from
the
expression
of
his
face
he
might
be
a
famous
for
a
large
stake
say
a
hundred
guineas
certain
with
the
game
in
his
hand
but
with
a
high
reputation
involved
in
his
playing
his
hand
out
to
the
last
card
in
a
masterly
way
not
in
the
least
anxious
or
disturbed
is
bucket
when
sir
leicester
appears
but
he
eyes
the
baronet
aside
as
he
comes
slowly
to
his
with
that
observant
gravity
of
yesterday
in
which
there
might
have
been
yesterday
but
for
the
audacity
of
the
idea
a
touch
of
compassion
i
am
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
officer
but
i
am
rather
later
than
my
usual
hour
this
morning
i
am
not
well
the
agitation
and
the
indignation
from
which
i
have
recently
suffered
have
been
too
much
for
me
i
am
subject
to
gout
sir
leicester
was
going
to
say
indisposition
and
would
have
said
it
to
anybody
else
but
bucket
palpably
knows
all
about
it
and
recent
circumstances
have
brought
it
on
as
he
takes
his
seat
with
some
difficulty
and
with
an
air
of
pain
bucket
draws
a
little
nearer
standing
with
one
of
his
large
hands
on
the
i
am
not
aware
officer
sir
leicester
observes
raising
his
eyes
to
his
face
whether
you
wish
us
to
be
alone
but
that
is
entirely
as
you
please
if
you
do
well
and
good
if
not
miss
dedlock
would
be
interested
why
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
returns
bucket
with
his
head
persuasively
on
one
side
and
his
forefinger
pendant
at
one
ear
like
an
earring
we
ca
be
too
private
just
at
present
you
will
presently
see
that
we
ca
be
too
private
a
lady
under
the
circumstances
and
especially
in
miss
dedlock
elevated
station
of
society
ca
but
be
agreeable
to
me
but
speaking
without
a
view
to
myself
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
assuring
you
that
i
know
we
be
too
private
that
is
enough
so
much
so
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
bucket
resumes
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
your
permission
to
turn
the
key
in
the
door
by
all
means
bucket
skilfully
and
softly
takes
that
precaution
stooping
on
his
knee
for
a
moment
from
mere
force
of
habit
so
to
adjust
the
key
in
the
lock
as
that
no
one
shall
peep
in
from
the
outerside
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
mentioned
yesterday
evening
that
i
wanted
but
a
very
little
to
complete
this
case
i
have
now
completed
it
and
collected
proof
against
the
person
who
did
this
crime
against
the
soldier
no
sir
leicester
dedlock
not
the
soldier
sir
leicester
looks
astounded
and
inquires
is
the
man
in
custody
bucket
tells
him
after
a
pause
it
was
a
woman
sir
leicester
leans
back
in
his
chair
and
breathlessly
ejaculates
good
heaven
now
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
bucket
begins
standing
over
him
with
one
hand
spread
out
on
the
and
the
forefinger
of
the
other
in
impressive
use
it
my
duty
to
prepare
you
for
a
train
of
circumstances
that
may
and
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
will
give
you
a
shock
but
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
you
are
a
gentleman
and
i
know
what
a
gentleman
is
and
what
a
gentleman
is
capable
of
a
gentleman
can
bear
a
shock
when
it
must
come
boldly
and
steadily
a
gentleman
can
make
up
his
mind
to
stand
up
against
almost
any
blow
why
take
yourself
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
if
there
a
blow
to
be
inflicted
on
you
you
naturally
think
of
your
family
you
ask
yourself
how
would
all
them
ancestors
of
yours
away
to
julius
caesar
not
to
go
beyond
him
at
present
have
borne
that
blow
you
remember
scores
of
them
that
would
have
borne
it
well
and
you
bear
it
well
on
their
accounts
and
to
maintain
the
family
credit
that
the
way
you
argue
and
that
the
way
you
act
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
sir
leicester
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
grasping
the
elbows
sits
looking
at
him
with
a
stony
face
now
sir
leicester
dedlock
proceeds
bucket
thus
preparing
you
let
me
beg
of
you
not
to
trouble
your
mind
for
a
moment
as
to
anything
having
come
to
my
knowledge
i
know
so
much
about
so
many
characters
high
and
low
that
a
piece
of
information
more
or
less
do
signify
a
straw
i
do
suppose
there
a
move
on
the
board
that
would
surprise
me
and
as
to
this
or
that
move
having
taken
place
why
my
knowing
it
is
no
odds
at
all
any
possible
move
whatever
provided
it
in
a
wrong
direction
being
a
probable
move
according
to
my
experience
therefore
what
i
say
to
you
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
is
do
you
go
and
let
yourself
be
put
out
of
the
way
because
of
my
knowing
anything
of
your
family
affairs
i
thank
you
for
your
preparation
returns
sir
leicester
after
a
silence
without
moving
hand
foot
or
feature
which
i
hope
is
not
necessary
though
i
give
it
credit
for
being
well
intended
be
so
good
as
to
go
on
also
sir
leicester
seems
to
shrink
in
the
shadow
of
his
figure
also
to
take
a
seat
if
you
have
no
objection
none
at
all
bucket
brings
a
chair
and
diminishes
his
shadow
now
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
with
this
short
preface
i
come
to
the
point
lady
dedlock
sir
leicester
raises
himself
in
his
seat
and
stares
at
him
fiercely
bucket
brings
the
finger
into
play
as
an
emollient
lady
dedlock
you
see
she
universally
admired
that
what
her
ladyship
is
she
universally
admired
says
bucket
i
would
greatly
prefer
officer
sir
leicester
returns
stiffly
my
lady
name
being
entirely
omitted
from
this
discussion
so
would
i
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
but
it
impossible
impossible
bucket
shakes
his
relentless
head
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
it
altogether
impossible
what
i
have
got
to
say
is
about
her
ladyship
she
is
the
pivot
it
all
turns
on
officer
retorts
sir
leicester
with
a
fiery
eye
and
a
quivering
lip
you
know
your
duty
do
your
duty
but
be
careful
not
to
overstep
it
i
would
not
suffer
it
i
would
not
endure
it
you
bring
my
lady
name
into
this
communication
upon
your
responsibility
upon
your
responsibility
my
lady
name
is
not
a
name
for
common
persons
to
trifle
with
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
say
what
i
must
say
and
no
more
i
hope
it
may
prove
so
very
well
go
on
go
on
sir
glancing
at
the
angry
eyes
which
now
avoid
him
and
at
the
angry
figure
trembling
from
head
to
foot
yet
striving
to
be
still
bucket
feels
his
way
with
his
forefinger
and
in
a
low
voice
proceeds
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
it
becomes
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
long
entertained
mistrusts
and
suspicions
of
lady
dedlock
if
he
had
dared
to
breathe
them
to
me
sir
which
he
never
did
i
would
have
killed
him
myself
exclaims
sir
leicester
striking
his
hand
upon
the
table
but
in
the
very
heat
and
fury
of
the
act
he
stops
fixed
by
the
knowing
eyes
of
bucket
whose
forefinger
is
slowly
going
and
who
with
mingled
confidence
and
patience
shakes
his
head
sir
leicester
dedlock
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
was
deep
and
close
and
what
he
fully
had
in
his
mind
in
the
very
beginning
i
ca
quite
take
upon
myself
to
say
but
i
know
from
his
lips
that
he
long
ago
suspected
lady
dedlock
of
having
discovered
through
the
sight
of
some
handwriting
in
this
very
house
and
when
you
yourself
sir
leicester
dedlock
were
present
the
existence
in
great
poverty
of
a
certain
person
who
had
been
her
lover
before
you
courted
her
and
who
ought
to
have
been
her
husband
bucket
stops
and
deliberately
repeats
ought
to
have
been
her
husband
not
a
doubt
about
it
i
know
from
his
lips
that
when
that
person
soon
afterwards
died
he
suspected
lady
dedlock
of
visiting
his
wretched
lodging
and
his
wretched
grave
alone
and
in
secret
i
know
from
my
own
inquiries
and
through
my
eyes
and
ears
that
lady
dedlock
did
make
such
visit
in
the
dress
of
her
own
maid
for
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
employed
me
to
reckon
up
her
ladyship
if
you
excuse
my
making
use
of
the
term
we
commonly
employ
and
i
reckoned
her
up
so
far
completely
i
confronted
the
maid
in
the
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
fields
with
a
witness
who
had
been
lady
dedlock
guide
and
there
could
be
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
she
had
worn
the
young
woman
dress
unknown
to
her
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
did
endeavour
to
pave
the
way
a
little
towards
these
unpleasant
disclosures
yesterday
by
saying
that
very
strange
things
happened
even
in
high
families
sometimes
all
this
and
more
has
happened
in
your
own
family
and
to
and
through
your
own
lady
it
my
belief
that
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
followed
up
these
inquiries
to
the
hour
of
his
death
and
that
he
and
lady
dedlock
even
had
bad
blood
between
them
upon
the
matter
that
very
night
now
only
you
put
that
to
lady
dedlock
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
and
ask
her
ladyship
whether
even
after
he
had
left
here
she
did
go
down
to
his
chambers
with
the
intention
of
saying
something
further
to
him
dressed
in
a
loose
black
mantle
with
a
deep
fringe
to
it
sir
leicester
sits
like
a
statue
gazing
at
the
cruel
finger
that
is
probing
the
of
his
heart
you
put
that
to
her
ladyship
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
from
me
inspector
bucket
of
the
detective
and
if
her
ladyship
makes
any
difficulty
about
admitting
of
it
you
tell
her
that
it
no
use
that
inspector
bucket
knows
it
and
knows
that
she
passed
the
soldier
as
you
called
him
though
he
not
in
the
army
now
and
knows
that
she
knows
she
passed
him
on
the
staircase
now
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
why
do
i
relate
all
this
sir
leicester
who
has
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
uttering
a
single
groan
requests
him
to
pause
for
a
moment
by
and
by
he
takes
his
hands
away
and
so
preserves
his
dignity
and
outward
calmness
though
there
is
no
more
colour
in
his
face
than
in
his
white
hair
that
bucket
is
a
little
awed
by
him
something
frozen
and
fixed
is
upon
his
manner
over
and
above
its
usual
shell
of
haughtiness
and
bucket
soon
detects
an
unusual
slowness
in
his
speech
with
now
and
then
a
curious
trouble
in
beginning
which
occasions
him
to
utter
inarticulate
sounds
with
such
sounds
he
now
breaks
silence
soon
however
controlling
himself
to
say
that
he
does
not
comprehend
why
a
gentleman
so
faithful
and
zealous
as
the
late
tulkinghorn
should
have
communicated
to
him
nothing
of
this
painful
this
distressing
this
this
overwhelming
this
incredible
intelligence
again
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
returns
bucket
put
it
to
her
ladyship
to
clear
that
up
put
it
to
her
ladyship
if
you
think
it
right
from
inspector
bucket
of
the
detective
you
find
or
i
much
mistaken
that
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
had
the
intention
of
communicating
the
whole
to
you
as
soon
as
he
considered
it
ripe
and
further
that
he
had
given
her
ladyship
so
to
understand
why
he
might
have
been
going
to
reveal
it
the
very
morning
when
i
examined
the
body
you
do
know
what
i
going
to
say
and
do
five
minutes
from
this
present
time
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
and
supposing
i
was
to
be
picked
off
now
you
might
wonder
why
i
had
done
it
do
you
see
true
sir
leicester
avoiding
with
some
trouble
those
obtrusive
sounds
says
true
at
this
juncture
a
considerable
noise
of
voices
is
heard
in
the
hall
bucket
after
listening
goes
to
the
softly
unlocks
and
opens
it
and
listens
again
then
he
draws
in
his
head
and
whispers
hurriedly
but
composedly
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
this
unfortunate
family
affair
has
taken
air
as
i
expected
it
might
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
being
cut
down
so
sudden
the
chance
to
hush
it
is
to
let
in
these
people
now
in
a
wrangle
with
your
footmen
would
you
mind
sitting
quiet
on
the
family
account
while
i
reckon
up
and
would
you
just
throw
in
a
nod
when
i
seem
to
ask
you
for
it
sir
leicester
indistinctly
answers
officer
the
best
you
can
the
best
you
can
and
bucket
with
a
nod
and
a
sagacious
crook
of
the
forefinger
slips
down
into
the
hall
where
the
voices
quickly
die
away
he
is
not
long
in
returning
a
few
paces
ahead
of
mercury
and
a
brother
deity
also
powdered
and
in
smalls
who
bear
between
them
a
chair
in
which
is
an
incapable
old
man
another
man
and
two
women
come
behind
directing
the
pitching
of
the
chair
in
an
affable
and
easy
manner
bucket
dismisses
the
mercuries
and
locks
the
door
again
sir
leicester
looks
on
at
this
invasion
of
the
sacred
precincts
with
an
icy
stare
now
perhaps
you
may
know
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
says
bucket
in
a
confidential
voice
i
am
inspector
bucket
of

tip
of

convenient
little
staff

loud
voice

bucket
with
a
steadfast
look
but
without
loss
of
temper

bucket

of
his

so
much
cheek

position

habit

deaf

a
moment
counsel
with
him
in
a
whisper
chadband
expressing
a
considerable
amount
of
oil
from
the
pores
of
his
forehead
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
says
aloud

my
eyes
there
was
a
bundle
of
letters
belonging
to
a
dead
and
gone
lodger
as

hid
away
at
the
back
of
a
shelf

to
ejaculate
oh

bucket
after

wo

so
quietly
i
handed
over
to
my
friend
and
solicitor
tulkinghorn
not
to
anybody
else
why
he
paid
you
for
them
you
know
and
handsome
too
says
bucket
i
do
care
for
that
i
want
to
know
who
got
and
i
tell
you
what
we
want
what
we
all
here
want
bucket
we
want
more
painstaking
and
into
this
murder
we
know
where
the
interest
and
the
motive
was
and
you
have
not
done
enough
if
george
the
vagabond
dragoon
had
any
hand
in
it
he
was
only
an
accomplice
and
was
set
on
you
know
what
i
mean
as
well
as
any
man
now
i
tell
you
what
says
bucket
instantaneously
altering
his
manner
coming
close
to
him
and
communicating
an
extraordinary
fascination
to
the
forefinger
i
am
damned
if
i
am
to
have
my
case
spoilt
or
interfered
with
or
anticipated
by
so
much
as
half
a
second
of
time
by
any
human
being
in
creation
you
want
more
painstaking
and
you
do
do
you
see
this
hand
and
do
you
think
that
i
do
know
the
right
time
to
stretch
it
out
and
put
it
on
the
arm
that
fired
that
shot
such
is
the
dread
power
of
the
man
and
so
terribly
evident
it
is
that
he
makes
no
idle
boast
that
smallweed
begins
to
apologize
bucket
dismissing
his
sudden
anger
checks
him
the
advice
i
give
you
is
do
you
trouble
your
head
about
the
murder
that
my
affair
you
keep
half
an
eye
on
the
newspapers
and
i
should
wonder
if
you
was
to
read
something
about
it
before
long
if
you
look
sharp
i
know
my
business
and
that
all
i
got
to
say
to
you
on
that
subject
now
about
those
letters
you
want
to
know
who
got
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
have
got
is
that
the
packet
smallweed
looks
with
greedy
eyes
at
the
little
bundle
bucket
produces
from
a
mysterious
part
of
his
coat
and
identifies
it
as
the
same
what
have
you
got
to
say
next
asks
bucket
now
do
open
your
mouth
too
wide
because
you
do
look
handsome
when
you
do
it
i
want
five
hundred
pound
no
you
do
you
mean
fifty
says
bucket
humorously
it
appears
however
that
smallweed
means
five
hundred
that
is
i
am
deputed
by
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
to
consider
without
admitting
or
promising
anything
this
bit
of
business
says
bucket
sir
leicester
mechanically
bows
his
head
and
you
ask
me
to
consider
a
proposal
of
five
hundred
pounds
why
it
an
unreasonable
proposal
two
fifty
would
be
bad
enough
but
better
than
that
had
you
better
say
two
fifty
smallweed
is
quite
clear
that
he
had
better
not
then
says
bucket
let
hear
chadband
lord
many
a
time
i
heard
my
old
of
that
name
and
a
moderate
man
he
was
in
all
respects
as
ever
i
come
across
thus
invited
chadband
steps
forth
and
after
a
little
sleek
smiling
and
a
little
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
delivers
himself
as
follows
my
friends
we
are
now
rachael
my
wife
and
i
in
the
mansions
of
the
rich
and
great
why
are
we
now
in
the
mansions
of
the
rich
and
great
my
friends
is
it
because
we
are
invited
because
we
are
bidden
to
feast
with
them
because
we
are
bidden
to
rejoice
with
them
because
we
are
bidden
to
play
the
lute
with
them
because
we
are
bidden
to
dance
with
them
no
then
why
are
we
here
my
friends
air
we
in
possession
of
a
sinful
secret
and
do
we
require
corn
and
wine
and
oil
or
what
is
much
the
same
thing
money
for
the
keeping
thereof
probably
so
my
friends
you
a
man
of
business
you
are
returns
bucket
very
attentive
and
consequently
you
going
on
to
mention
what
the
nature
of
your
secret
is
you
are
right
you
could
do
better
let
us
then
my
brother
in
a
spirit
of
love
says
chadband
with
a
cunning
eye
proceed
unto
it
rachael
my
wife
advance
chadband
more
than
ready
so
advances
as
to
jostle
her
husband
into
the
background
and
confronts
bucket
with
a
hard
frowning
smile
since
you
want
to
know
what
we
know
says
she
i
tell
you
i
helped
to
bring
up
miss
hawdon
her
ladyship
daughter
i
was
in
the
service
of
her
ladyship
sister
who
was
very
sensitive
to
the
disgrace
her
ladyship
brought
upon
her
and
gave
out
even
to
her
ladyship
that
the
child
was
dead
she
was
very
nearly
so
when
she
was
born
but
she
alive
and
i
know
her
with
these
words
and
a
laugh
and
laying
a
bitter
stress
on
the
word
ladyship
chadband
folds
her
arms
and
looks
implacably
at
bucket
i
suppose
now
returns
that
officer
you
will
be
expecting
a
note
or
a
present
of
about
that
figure
chadband
merely
laughs
and
contemptuously
tells
him
he
can
offer
twenty
pence
my
friend
the
good
lady
over
there
says
bucket
luring
snagsby
forward
with
the
finger
what
may
your
game
be
snagsby
is
at
first
prevented
by
tears
and
lamentations
from
stating
the
nature
of
her
game
but
by
degrees
it
confusedly
comes
to
light
that
she
is
a
woman
overwhelmed
with
injuries
and
wrongs
whom
snagsby
has
habitually
deceived
abandoned
and
sought
to
keep
in
darkness
and
whose
chief
comfort
under
her
afflictions
has
been
the
sympathy
of
the
late
tulkinghorn
who
showed
so
much
commiseration
for
her
on
one
occasion
of
his
calling
in
cook
court
in
the
absence
of
her
perjured
husband
that
she
has
of
late
habitually
carried
to
him
all
her
woes
everybody
it
appears
the
present
company
excepted
has
plotted
against
snagsby
peace
there
is
guppy
clerk
to
kenge
and
carboy
who
was
at
first
as
open
as
the
sun
at
noon
but
who
suddenly
shut
up
as
close
as
midnight
under
the
influence
no
doubt
of
snagsby
suborning
and
tampering
there
is
weevle
friend
of
guppy
who
lived
mysteriously
up
a
court
owing
to
the
like
coherent
causes
there
was
krook
deceased
there
was
nimrod
deceased
and
there
was
jo
deceased
and
they
were
all
in
it
in
what
snagsby
does
not
with
particularity
express
but
she
knows
that
jo
was
son
as
well
as
if
a
trumpet
had
spoken
it
and
she
followed
snagsby
when
he
went
on
his
last
visit
to
the
boy
and
if
he
was
not
his
son
why
did
he
go
the
one
occupation
of
her
life
has
been
for
some
time
back
to
follow
snagsby
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
and
to
piece
suspicious
circumstances
together
and
every
circumstance
that
has
happened
has
been
most
suspicious
and
in
this
way
she
has
pursued
her
object
of
detecting
and
confounding
her
false
husband
night
and
day
thus
did
it
come
to
pass
that
she
brought
the
chadbands
and
tulkinghorn
together
and
conferred
with
tulkinghorn
on
the
change
in
guppy
and
helped
to
turn
up
the
circumstances
in
which
the
present
company
are
interested
casually
by
the
wayside
being
still
and
ever
on
the
great
high
road
that
is
to
terminate
in
snagsby
full
exposure
and
a
matrimonial
separation
all
this
snagsby
as
an
injured
woman
and
the
friend
of
chadband
and
the
follower
of
chadband
and
the
mourner
of
the
late
tulkinghorn
is
here
to
certify
under
the
seal
of
confidence
with
every
possible
confusion
and
involvement
possible
and
impossible
having
no
pecuniary
motive
whatever
no
scheme
or
project
but
the
one
mentioned
and
bringing
here
and
taking
everywhere
her
own
dense
atmosphere
of
dust
arising
from
the
ceaseless
working
of
her
mill
of
jealousy
while
this
exordium
is
in
hand
and
it
takes
some
time
bucket
who
has
seen
through
the
transparency
of
snagsby
vinegar
at
a
glance
confers
with
his
familiar
demon
and
bestows
his
shrewd
attention
on
the
chadbands
and
smallweed
sir
leicester
dedlock
remains
immovable
with
the
same
icy
surface
upon
him
except
that
he
once
or
twice
looks
towards
bucket
as
relying
on
that
officer
alone
of
all
mankind
very
good
says
bucket
now
i
understand
you
you
know
and
being
deputed
by
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
to
look
into
this
little
matter
again
sir
leicester
mechanically
bows
in
confirmation
of
the
statement
can
give
it
my
fair
and
full
attention
now
i
wo
allude
to
conspiring
to
extort
money
or
anything
of
that
sort
because
we
are
men
and
women
of
the
world
here
and
our
object
is
to
make
things
pleasant
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
wonder
at
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
think
of
making
a
noise
below
in
the
hall
it
was
so
opposed
to
your
interests
that
what
i
look
at
we
wanted
to
get
in
pleads
smallweed
why
of
course
you
wanted
to
get
in
bucket
asserts
with
cheerfulness
but
for
a
old
gentleman
at
your
time
of
life
what
i
call
truly
venerable
mind
you
with
his
wits
sharpened
as
i
have
no
doubt
they
are
by
the
loss
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
which
occasions
all
his
animation
to
mount
up
into
his
head
not
to
consider
that
if
he
do
keep
such
a
business
as
the
present
as
close
as
possible
it
ca
be
worth
a
mag
to
him
is
so
curious
you
see
your
temper
got
the
better
of
you
that
where
you
lost
ground
says
bucket
in
an
argumentative
and
friendly
way
i
only
said
i
would
go
without
one
of
the
servants
came
up
to
sir
leicester
dedlock
returns
smallweed
that
it
that
where
your
temper
got
the
better
of
you
now
you
keep
it
under
another
time
and
you
make
money
by
it
shall
i
ring
for
them
to
carry
you
down
when
are
we
to
hear
more
of
this
chadband
sternly
demands
bless
your
heart
for
a
true
woman
always
curious
your
delightful
sex
is
replies
bucket
with
gallantry
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
you
a
call
or
next
day
not
forgetting
smallweed
and
his
proposal
of
two
fifty
five
hundred
exclaims
smallweed
all
right
nominally
five
hundred
bucket
has
his
hand
on
the
shall
i
wish
you
good
day
for
the
present
on
the
part
of
myself
and
the
gentleman
of
the
house
he
asks
in
an
insinuating
tone
nobody
having
the
hardihood
to
object
to
his
doing
so
he
does
it
and
the
party
retire
as
they
came
up
bucket
follows
them
to
the
door
and
returning
says
with
an
air
of
serious
business
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
it
for
you
to
consider
whether
or
not
to
buy
this
up
i
should
recommend
on
the
whole
it
being
bought
up
myself
and
i
think
it
may
be
bought
pretty
cheap
you
see
that
little
pickled
cowcumber
of
a
snagsby
has
been
used
by
all
sides
of
the
speculation
and
has
done
a
deal
more
harm
in
bringing
odds
and
ends
together
than
if
she
had
meant
it
tulkinghorn
deceased
he
held
all
these
horses
in
his
hand
and
could
have
drove
his
own
way
i
have
a
doubt
but
he
was
fetched
off
the
box
and
now
they
have
got
their
legs
over
the
traces
and
are
all
dragging
and
pulling
their
own
ways
so
it
is
and
such
is
life
the
cat
away
and
the
mice
they
play
the
frost
breaks
up
and
the
water
runs
now
with
regard
to
the
party
to
be
apprehended
sir
leicester
seems
to
wake
though
his
eyes
have
been
wide
open
and
he
looks
intently
at
bucket
as
bucket
refers
to
his
watch
the
party
to
be
apprehended
is
now
in
this
house
proceeds
bucket
putting
up
his
watch
with
a
steady
hand
and
with
rising
spirits
and
i
about
to
take
her
into
custody
in
your
presence

course
of
the
evening

this
unfortunate
family
matter
and
the
nobbiest
way
of
keeping
it
quiet

sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
do
you
be
nervous
on
account
of
the
apprehension
at
present

shall
see
the
whole
case
clear
from
first
to
last
bucket
rings
goes
to
the
door
briefly
whispers
mercury
shuts
the
door
and
stands
behind
it
with
his
arms
folded
after
a
suspense
of
a
minute
or
two
the
door
slowly
opens
and
a
frenchwoman
enters
mademoiselle
hortense
the
moment
she
is
in
the
room
bucket
claps
the
door
to
and
puts
his
back
against
it
the
suddenness
of
the
noise
occasions
her
to
turn
and
then
for
the
first
time
she
sees
sir
leicester
dedlock
in
his
chair
i
ask
you
pardon
she
mutters
hurriedly
they
tell
me
there
was
no
one
here
her
step
towards
the
door
brings
her
front
to
front
with
bucket
suddenly
a
spasm
shoots
across
her
face
and
she
turns
deadly
pale
this
is
my
lodger
sir
leicester
dedlock
says
bucket
nodding
at
her
this
foreign
young
woman
has
been
my
lodger
for
some
weeks
back
what

for
that

my
angel

mademoiselle
in
a
jocular
strain
why
my
angel
returns
bucket
we
shall
see
mademoiselle
hortense
eyes
him
with
a
scowl
upon
her
tight
face
which
gradually
changes
into
a
smile
of
scorn
you
are
very
mysterieuse

you
drunk
tolerable
sober
my
angel
returns
bucket
i
come
from
arriving
at
this

detestable
house

minutes

tell
me
downstairs
that

wife

and
your
wife
is
not
here
what
is
the
intention
of
this
fool

then
mademoiselle
demands
with
her
arms
composedly
crossed
but
with
something
in
her
dark
cheek
beating
like
a
clock
bucket
merely
shakes
the
finger
at
her
ah
my
god
you
are
an
unhappy
idiot
cries
mademoiselle
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
a
laugh
leave
me
to
pass
downstairs
great
pig
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
and
a
menace
now
mademoiselle
says
bucket
in
a
cool
determined
way
you
go
and
sit
down
upon
that
sofy
i
will
not
sit
down
upon
nothing
she
replies
with
a
shower
of
nods
now
mademoiselle
repeats
bucket
making
no
demonstration
except
with
the
finger
you
sit
down
upon
that
sofy
why
because
i
take
you
into
custody
on
a
charge
of
murder

half
a
blessed
moment
has
passed
over
your
head
to
go
and
sit
down
upon
that
sofy
mademoiselle
complies
saying
in
a
concentrated
voice
while
that
something
in
her
cheek
beats
fast
and
hard
you
are
a
devil
now
you
see
bucket
proceeds
approvingly
you
comfortable
and
conducting
yourself
as
i
should
expect
a
foreign
young
woman
of
your
sense
to
do
so
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
and
it
this
do
you
talk
too
much
you
not
expected
to
say
anything
here
and
you
ca
keep
too
quiet
a
tongue
in
your
head
in
short
the
less
you
parlay
the
better
you
know
bucket
is
very
complacent
over
this
french
explanation
mademoiselle
with
that
tigerish
expansion
of
the
mouth
and
her
black
eyes
darting
fire
upon
him
sits
upright
on
the
sofa
in
a
rigid
state
with
her
hands
clenched
and
her
feet
too
one
might
suppose
muttering
oh
you
bucket
you
are
a
devil
now
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
says
bucket
and
from
this
time
forth
the
finger
never
rests
this
young
woman
my
lodger
was
her
ladyship
maid
at
the
time
i
have
mentioned
to
you
and
this
young
woman
besides
being
extraordinary
vehement
and
passionate
against
her
ladyship
after
being
discharged
lie
cries
mademoiselle
i
discharge
myself
now
why
do
you
take
my
advice
returns
bucket
in
an
impressive
almost
in
an
imploring
tone
i
surprised
at
the
indiscreetness
you
commit
you
say
something
that
be
used
against
you
you
know
you
sure
to
come
to
it
never
you
mind
what

in
evidence

is
not
addressed
to
you

too
cries
mademoiselle
furiously
by
her
ladyship
eh
my
faith
a
pretty
ladyship
why
i
my
character
by
remaining
with
a
ladyship
so
infame
upon
my
soul
i
wonder
at
you
bucket
remonstrates
i
thought
the
french
were
a
polite
nation
i
did
really
yet
to
hear
a
female
going
on
like
that
before
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
he
is
a
poor
abused
cries
mademoiselle
i
spit
upon
his
house
upon
his
name
upon
his
imbecility
all
of
which
she
makes
the
carpet
represent
oh
that
he
is
a
great
man
oh
yes
superb
oh
heaven
bah
well
sir
leicester
dedlock
proceeds
bucket
this
intemperate
foreigner
also
angrily
took
it
into
her
head
that
she
had
established
a
claim
upon
tulkinghorn
deceased
by
attending
on
the
occasion
i
told
you
of
at
his
chambers
though
she
was
liberally
paid
for
her
time
and
trouble
lie
cries
mademoiselle
i
his
money
all
togezzer
if
you
will
parlay
you
know
says
bucket
parenthetically
you
must
take
the
consequences
now
whether
she
became
my
lodger
sir
leicester
dedlock
with
any
deliberate
intention
then
of
doing
this
deed
and
blinding
me
i
give
no
opinion
on
but
she
lived
in
my
house
in
that
capacity
at
the
time
that
she
was
hovering
about
the
chambers
of
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
with
a
view
to
a
wrangle
and
likewise
persecuting
and
half
frightening
the
life
out
of
an
unfortunate
stationer
lie
cries
mademoiselle
all
lie
the
murder
was
committed
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
and
you
know
under
what
circumstances
now
i
beg
of
you
to
follow
me
close
with
your
attention
for
a
minute
or
two
i
was
sent
for
and
the
case
was
entrusted
to
me
i
examined
the
place
and
the
body
and
the
papers
and
everything
from
information
i
received
from
a
clerk
in
the
same
house
i
took
george
into
custody
as
having
been
seen
hanging
about
there
on
the
night
and
at
very
nigh
the
time
of
the
murder
also
as
having
been
overheard
in
high
words
with
the
deceased
on
former
occasions
even
threatening
him
as
the
witness
made
out
if
you
ask
me
sir
leicester
dedlock
whether
from
the
first
i
believed
george
to
be
the
murderer
i
tell
you
candidly
no
but
he
might
be
notwithstanding
and
there
was
enough
against
him
to
make
it
my
duty
to
take
him
and
get
him
kept
under
remand
now
observe
as
bucket
bends
forward
in
some
excitement
for
him
and
inaugurates
what
he
is
going
to
say
with
one
ghostly
beat
of
his
forefinger
in
the
air
mademoiselle
hortense
fixes
her
black
eyes
upon
him
with
a
dark
frown
and
sets
her
dry
lips
closely
and
firmly
together
i
went
home
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
at
night
and
found
this
young
woman
having
supper
with
my
wife
bucket
she
had
made
a
mighty
show
of
being
fond
of
bucket
from
her
first
offering
herself
as
our
lodger
but
that
night
she
made
more
than
ever
in
fact
overdid
it
likewise
she
overdid
her
respect
and
all
that
for
the
lamented
memory
of
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
by
the
living
lord
it
flashed
upon
me
as
i
sat
opposite
to
her
at
the
table
and
saw
her
with
a
knife
in
her
hand
that
she
had
done
it
mademoiselle
is
hardly
audible
in
straining
through
her
teeth
and
lips
the
words
you
are
a
devil
now
where
pursues
bucket
had
she
been
on
the
night
of
the
murder
she
had
been
to
the
theayter
she
really
was
there
i
have
since
found
both
before
the
deed
and
after
it
i
knew
i
had
an
artful
customer
to
deal
with
and
that
proof
would
be
very
difficult
and
i
laid
a
trap
for
her
such
a
trap
as
i
never
laid
yet
and
such
a
venture
as
i
never
made
yet
i
worked
it
out
in
my
mind
while
i
was
talking
to
her
at
supper
when
i
went
upstairs
to
bed
our
house
being
small
and
this
young
woman
ears
sharp
i
stuffed
the
sheet

she
should
say
a
word
of
surprise
and
told
her
all
about
it
my
dear
do
you
give
your
mind
to
that
again
or
i
shall
link
your
feet
together
at
the
ankles
bucket
breaking
off
has
made
a
noiseless
descent
upon
mademoiselle
and
laid
his
heavy
hand
upon
her
shoulder
what
is
the
matter
with
you
now
she
asks
him
do
you
think
any
more

with
admonitory
finger
of
throwing
yourself
out
of
window

what
the
matter
with

a
married
man
you
know
acquainted
with
my
wife
just
take
my
arm
vainly
endeavouring
to
moisten
those
dry
lips
with
a
painful
sound
she
struggles
with
herself
and
complies
now
we
all
right
again
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
this
case
could
never
have
been
the
case
it
is
but
for
bucket
who
is
a
woman
in
fifty
thousand
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
to
throw
this
young
woman
off
her
guard
i
have
never
set
foot
in
our
house
since
though
i
communicated
with
bucket
in
the
loaves
and
in
the
milk
as
often
as
required
my
whispered
words
to
bucket
when
she
had
the
sheet
in
her
mouth
were
dear
can
you
throw
her
off
continually
with
natural
accounts
of
my
suspicions
against
george
and
this
and
that
and
can
you
do
without
rest
and
keep
watch
upon
her
night
and
day
can
you
undertake
to
say
shall
do
nothing
without
my
knowledge
she
shall
be
my
prisoner
without
suspecting
it
she
shall
no
more
escape
from
me
than
from
death
and
her
life
shall
be
my
life
and
her
soul
my
soul
till
i
have
got
her
if
she
did
this
murder
bucket
says
to
me
as
well
as
she
could
speak
on
account
of
the
sheet
i
can
and
she
has
acted
up
to
it
glorious
lies
mademoiselle
interposes
all
lies
my
friend
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
how
did
my
calculations
come
out
under
these
circumstances
when
i
calculated
that
this
impetuous
young
woman
would
overdo
it
in
new
directions
was
i
wrong
or
right
i
was
right
what
does
she
try
to
do
do
let
it
give
you
a
turn
to
throw
the
murder
on
her
ladyship
sir
leicester
rises
from
his
chair
and
staggers
down
again
and
she
got
encouragement
in
it
from
hearing
that
i
was
always
here
which
was
done
now
open
that
of
mine
sir
leicester
dedlock
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
of
throwing
it
towards
you
and
look
at
the
letters
sent
to
me
each
with
the
two
words
dedlock
in
it
open
the
one
directed
to
yourself
which
i
stopped
this
very
morning
and
read
the
three
words
dedlock
murderess
in
it
these
letters
have
been
falling
about
like
a
shower
of
what
do
you
say
now
to
bucket
from
her
having
seen
them
all
by
this
young
woman
what
do
you
say
to
bucket
having
within
this
secured
the
corresponding
ink
and
paper
fellow
and
what
not
what
do
you
say
to
bucket
having
watched
the
posting
of
every
one
by
this
young
woman
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
bucket
asks
triumphant
in
his
admiration
of
his
lady
genius
two
things
are
especially
observable
as
bucket
proceeds
to
a
conclusion
first
that
he
seems
imperceptibly
to
establish
a
dreadful
right
of
property
in
mademoiselle
secondly
that
the
very
atmosphere
she
breathes
seems
to
narrow
and
contract
about
her
as
if
a
close
net
or
a
pall
were
being
drawn
nearer
and
yet
nearer
around
her
breathless
figure
there
is
no
doubt
that
her
ladyship
was
on
the
spot
at
the
eventful
period
says
bucket
and
my
foreign
friend
here
saw
her
i
believe
from
the
upper
part
of
the
staircase
her
ladyship
and
george
and
my
foreign
friend
were
all
pretty
close
on
one
heels
but
that
do
signify
any
more
so
i
not
go
into
it
i
found
the
wadding
of
the
pistol
with
which
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
was
shot
it
was
a
bit
of
the
printed
description
of
your
house
at
chesney
wold
not
much
in
that
you
say
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
no
but
when
my
foreign
friend
here
is
so
thoroughly
off
her
guard
as
to
think
it
a
safe
time
to
tear
up
the
rest
of
that
leaf
and
when
bucket
puts
the
pieces
together
and
finds
the
wadding
wanting
it
begins
to
look
like
queer
street
these
are
very
long
lies
mademoiselle
interposes
you
prose
great
deal
is
it
that
you
have
almost
all
finished
or
are
you
speaking
always
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
proceeds
bucket
who
delights
in
a
full
title
and
does
violence
to
himself
when
he
dispenses
with
any
fragment
of
it
the
last
point
in
the
case
which
i
am
now
going
to
mention
shows
the
necessity
of
patience
in
our
business
and
never
doing
a
thing
in
a
hurry
i
watched
this
young
woman
yesterday
without
her
knowledge
when
she
was
looking
at
the
funeral
in
company
with
my
wife
who
planned
to
take
her
there
and
i
had
so
much
to
convict
her
and
i
saw
such
an
expression
in
her
face
and
my
mind
so
rose
against
her
malice
towards
her
ladyship
and
the
time
was
altogether
such
a
time
for
bringing
down
what
you
may
call
retribution
upon
her
that
if
i
had
been
a
younger
hand
with
less
experience
i
should
have
taken
her
certain
equally
last
night
when
her
ladyship
as
is
so
universally
admired
i
am
sure
come
home
looking
why
lord
a
man
might
almost
say
like
venus
rising
from
the
ocean
it
was
so
unpleasant
and
inconsistent
to
think
of
her
being
charged
with
a
murder
of
which
she
was
innocent
that
i
felt
quite
to
want
to
put
an
end
to
the
job
what
should
i
have
lost
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
should
have
lost
the
weapon
my
prisoner
here
proposed
to
bucket
after
the
departure
of
the
funeral
that
they
should
go
per
bus
a
little
ways
into
the
country
and
take
tea
at
a
very
decent
house
of
entertainment
now
near
that
house
of
entertainment
there
a
piece
of
water
at
tea
my
prisoner
got
up
to
fetch
her
pocket
handkercher
from
the
bedroom
where
the
bonnets
was
she
was
rather
a
long
time
gone
and
came
back
a
little
out
of
wind
as
soon
as
they
came
home
this
was
reported
to
me
by
bucket
along
with
her
observations
and
suspicions
i
had
the
piece
of
water
dragged
by
moonlight
in
presence
of
a
couple
of
our
men
and
the
pocket
pistol
was
brought
up
before
it
had
been
there
hours
now
my
dear
put
your
arm
a
little
further
through
mine
and
hold
it
steady
and
i
sha
hurt
you
in
a
trice
bucket
snaps
a
handcuff
on
her
wrist
that
one
says
bucket
now
the
other
darling
two
and
all
told
he
rises
she
rises
too
where
she
asks
him
darkening
her
large
eyes
until
their
drooping
lids
almost
conceal
them
and
yet
they
stare
where
is
your
false
your
treacherous
and
cursed
wife
she
gone
forrard
to
the
police
office
returns
bucket
you
see
her
there
my
dear
i
would
like
to
kiss
her
exclaims
mademoiselle
hortense
panting
you
bite
her
i
suspect
says
bucket
i
would
making
her
eyes
very
large
i
would
love
to
tear
her
limb
from
limb
bless
you
darling
says
bucket
with
the
greatest
composure
i
fully
prepared
to
hear
that
your
sex
have
such
a
surprising
animosity
against
one
another
when
you
do
differ
you
do
mind
me
half
so
much
do
you
no
though
you
are
a
devil
still
angel
and
devil
by
turns
eh
cries
bucket
but
i
am
in
my
regular
employment
you
must
consider
let
me
put
your
shawl
tidy
i
been
lady
maid
to
a
good
many
before
now
anything
wanting
to
the
bonnet
there
a
cab
at
the
door
mademoiselle
hortense
casting
an
indignant
eye
at
the
glass
shakes
herself
perfectly
neat
in
one
shake
and
looks
to
do
her
justice
uncommonly
genteel
listen
then
my
angel
says
she
after
several
sarcastic
nods
you
are
very
spiritual
but
can
you
restore
him
back
to
life
bucket
answers
not
exactly
that
is
droll
listen
yet
one
time
you
are
very
spiritual
can
you
make
a
honourable
lady
of
her
do
be
so
malicious
says
bucket
or
a
haughty
gentleman
of
him
cries
mademoiselle
referring
to
sir
leicester
with
ineffable
disdain
eh
oh
then
regard
him
the
poor
infant
ha
ha
ha
come
come
why
this
is
worse
parlaying
than
the
other
says
bucket
come
along
you
can
not
do
these
things
then
you
can
do
as
you
please
with
me
it
is
but
the
death
it
is
all
the
same
let
us
go
my
angel
adieu
you
old
man
grey
i
pity
you
and
i
despise
you
with
these
last
words
she
snaps
her
teeth
together
as
if
her
mouth
closed
with
a
spring
it
is
impossible
to
describe
how
bucket
gets
her
out
but
he
accomplishes
that
feat
in
a
manner
so
peculiar
to
himself
enfolding
and
pervading
her
like
a
cloud
and
hovering
away
with
her
as
if
he
were
a
homely
jupiter
and
she
the
object
of
his
affections
sir
leicester
left
alone
remains
in
the
same
attitude
as
though
he
were
still
listening
and
his
attention
were
still
occupied
at
length
he
gazes
round
the
empty
room
and
finding
it
deserted
rises
unsteadily
to
his
feet
pushes
back
his
chair
and
walks
a
few
steps
supporting
himself
by
the
table
then
he
stops
and
with
more
of
those
inarticulate
sounds
lifts
up
his
eyes
and
seems
to
stare
at
something
heaven
knows
what
he
sees
the
green
green
woods
of
chesney
wold
the
noble
house
the
pictures
of
his
forefathers
strangers
defacing
them
officers
of
police
coarsely
handling
his
most
precious
heirlooms
thousands
of
fingers
pointing
at
him
thousands
of
faces
sneering
at
him
but
if
such
shadows
flit
before
him
to
his
bewilderment
there
is
one
other
shadow
which
he
can
name
with
something
like
distinctness
even
yet
and
to
which
alone
he
addresses
his
tearing
of
his
white
hair
and
his
extended
arms
it
is
she
in
association
with
whom
saving
that
she
has
been
for
years
a
main
fibre
of
the
root
of
his
dignity
and
pride
he
has
never
had
a
selfish
thought
it
is
she
whom
he
has
loved
admired
honoured
and
set
up
for
the
world
to
respect
it
is
she
who
at
the
core
of
all
the
constrained
formalities
and
conventionalities
of
his
life
has
been
a
stock
of
living
tenderness
and
love
susceptible
as
nothing
else
is
of
being
struck
with
the
agony
he
feels
he
sees
her
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
himself
and
can
not
bear
to
look
upon
her
cast
down
from
the
high
place
she
has
graced
so
well
and
even
to
the
point
of
his
sinking
on
the
ground
oblivious
of
his
suffering
he
can
yet
pronounce
her
name
with
something
like
distinctness
in
the
midst
of
those
intrusive
sounds
and
in
a
tone
of
mourning
and
compassion
rather
than
reproach

you

out
my

why
george
returns
bagnet
was
always
free
with
me
and
when
he
said
at
our
house
to
my
woolwich
that
of
all
the
things
my
woolwich
could
have
to
think
of
when
he
grew
to
be
a
man
the
comfortablest
would
be
that
he
had
never
brought
a
sorrowful
line
into
his
mother
face
or
turned
a
hair
of
her
head
grey
then
i
felt
sure
from
his
way
that
something
fresh
had
brought
his
own
mother
into
his
mind
i
had
often
known
him
say
to
me
in

times

he
had
behaved
bad

her

he
was

me
and
loving
to
me
was
my
george
but
he
had
a
bold
spirit
and
he
ran
a
little
wild
and
went
for
a
soldier
and
i
know
he
waited
at
first
in
letting
us
know
about
himself
till
he
should
rise
to
be
an
officer
and
when
he
did
rise
i
know
he
considered
himself
beneath
us
and
would
be
a
disgrace
to
us
for
he
had
a
lion
heart
had
my
george
always
from
a
baby
the
old
lady
hands
stray
about
her
as
of
yore
while
she
recalls
all
in
a
tremble
what
a
likely
lad
what
a
fine
lad
what
a
gay
clever
lad
he
was
how
they
all
took
to
him
down
at
chesney
wold
how
sir
leicester
took
to
him
when
he
was
a
young
gentleman
how
the
dogs
took
to
him
how
even
the
people
who
had
been
angry
with
him
forgave
him
the
moment
he
was
gone
poor
boy
and
now
to
see
him
after
all
and
in
a
prison
too
and
the
broad
stomacher
heaves
and
the
quaint
upright
figure
bends

without
passing
the

across

eyes

chirps
up
in

cheery
manner

him
in

you
this

you
pretty
often

and
out
of

abroad
and
at
home
and
i
never
see
you
so
melancholy
penitent

i
am
melancholy
and
penitent
both
this
afternoon
that
you
see
me
so
have
you
done

says

shaking
his
head
i
have
done

been
done
this
many
a
long
year
and
is
best
not
tried
to
be
undone
now
if
i
ever
get
to
heaven
it
wo
be
for
being
a
good
son
to
a
widowed
mother
i
say
no
more
now
when
george
says
to
me
that
it
best
not
tried
to
be
undone
now
i
have
my
thoughts
as
i
have
often
had
before
and
i
draw
it
out
of
george
how
he
comes
to
have
such
things
on
him
that
afternoon
then
george
tells
me
that
he
has
seen
by
chance
at
the
lawyer
office
a
fine
old
lady
that
has
brought
his
mother
plain
before
him
and
he
runs
on
about
that
old
lady
till
he
quite
forgets
himself
and
paints
her
picture
to
me
as
she
used
to
be
years
upon
years
back
so
i
says
to
george
when
he
has
done
who
is
this
old
lady
he
has
seen
and
george
tells
me
it
rouncewell
housekeeper
for
more
than
half
a
century
to
the
dedlock
family
down
at
chesney
wold
in
lincolnshire
george
has
frequently
told
me
before
that
he
a
lincolnshire
man
and
i
says
to
my
old
lignum
that
night
that
his
mother
for
five
and
pound
all
this
bagnet
now
relates
for
the
twentieth
time
at
least
within
the
last
four
hours
trilling
it
out
like
a
kind
of
bird
with
a
pretty
high
note
that
it
may
be
audible
to
the
old
lady
above
the
hum
of
the
wheels
bless
you
and
thank
you
says
rouncewell
bless
you
and
thank
you
my
worthy
soul
dear
heart
cries
bagnet
in
the
most
natural
manner
no
thanks
to
me
i
am
sure
thanks
to
yourself
for
being
so
ready
to
pay
and
mind
once
more
what
you
had
best
do
on
finding
george
to
be
your
own
son
is
to
make
him
for
your
sake
have
every
sort
of
help
to
put
himself
in
the
right
and
clear
himself
of
a
charge
of
which
he
is
as
innocent
as
you
or
me
it
do
to
have
truth
and
justice
on
his
side
he
must
have
law
and
lawyers
exclaims
the
old
girl
apparently
persuaded
that
the
latter
form
a
separate
establishment
and
have
dissolved
partnership
with
truth
and
justice
for
ever
and
a
day
he
shall
have
says
rouncewell
all
the
help
that
can
be
got
for
him
in
the
world
my
dear
i
will
spend
all
i
have
and
thankfully
to
procure
it
sir
leicester
will
do
his
best
the
whole
family
will
do
their
best
i
i
know
something
my
dear
and
will
make
my
own
appeal
as
his
mother
parted
from
him
all
these
years
and
finding
him
in
a
jail
at
last
the
extreme
disquietude
of
the
old
housekeeper
manner
in
saying
this
her
broken
words
and
her
wringing
of
her
hands
make
a
powerful
impression
on
bagnet
and
would
astonish
her
but
that
she
refers
them
all
to
her
sorrow
for
her
son
condition
and
yet
bagnet
wonders
too
why
rouncewell
should
murmur
so
distractedly
my
lady
my
lady
my
lady
over
and
over
again
the
frosty
night
wears
away
and
the
dawn
breaks
and
the
comes
rolling
on
through
the
early
mist
like
the
ghost
of
a
chaise
departed
it
has
plenty
of
spectral
company
in
ghosts
of
trees
and
hedges
slowly
vanishing
and
giving
place
to
the
realities
of
day
london
reached
the
travellers
alight
the
old
housekeeper
in
great
tribulation
and
confusion
bagnet
quite
fresh
and
collected
as
she
would
be
if
her
next
point
with
no
new
equipage
and
outfit
were
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
island
of
ascension
hong
kong
or
any
other
military
station
but
when
they
set
out
for
the
prison
where
the
trooper
is
confined
the
old
lady
has
managed
to
draw
about
her
with
her
dress
much
of
the
staid
calmness
which
is
its
usual
accompaniment
a
wonderfully
grave
precise
and
handsome
piece
of
old
china
she
looks
though
her
heart
beats
fast
and
her
stomacher
is
ruffled
more
than
even
the
remembrance
of
this
wayward
son
has
ruffled
it
these
many
years
approaching
the
cell
they
find
the
door
opening
and
a
warder
in
the
act
of
coming
out
the
old
girl
promptly
makes
a
sign
of
entreaty
to
him
to
say
nothing
assenting
with
a
nod
he
suffers
them
to
enter
as
he
shuts
the
door
so
george
who
is
writing
at
his
table
supposing
himself
to
be
alone
does
not
raise
his
eyes
but
remains
absorbed
the
old
housekeeper
looks
at
him
and
those
wandering
hands
of
hers
are
quite
enough
for
bagnet
confirmation
even
if
she
could
see
the
mother
and
the
son
together
knowing
what
she
knows
and
doubt
their
relationship
not
a
rustle
of
the
housekeeper
dress
not
a
gesture
not
a
word
betrays
her
she
stands
looking
at
him
as
he
writes
on
all
unconscious
and
only
her
fluttering
hands
give
utterance
to
her
emotions
but
they
are
very
eloquent
very
very
eloquent
bagnet
understands
them
they
speak
of
gratitude
of
joy
of
grief
of
hope
of
inextinguishable
affection
cherished
with
no
return
since
this
stalwart
man
was
a
stripling
of
a
better
son
loved
less
and
this
son
loved
so
fondly
and
so
proudly
and
they
speak
in
such
touching
language
that
bagnet
eyes
brim
up
with
tears
and
they
run
glistening
down
her
face
george
rouncewell
oh
my
dear
child
turn
and
look
at
me
the
trooper
starts
up
clasps
his
mother
round
the
neck
and
falls
down
on
his
knees
before
her
whether
in
a
late
repentance
whether
in
the
first
association
that
comes
back
upon
him
he
puts
his
hands
together
as
a
child
does
when
it
says
its
prayers
and
raising
them
towards
her
breast
bows
down
his
head
and
cries
my
george
my
dearest
son
always
my
favourite
and
my
favourite
still
where
have
you
been
these
cruel
years
and
years
grown
such
a
man
too
grown
such
a
fine
strong
man
grown
so
like
what
i
knew
he
must
be
if
it
pleased
god
he
was
alive
she
can
ask
and
he
can
answer
nothing
connected
for
a
time
all
that
time
the
old
girl
turned
away
leans
one
arm
against
the
whitened
wall
leans
her
honest
forehead
upon
it
wipes
her
eyes
with
her
serviceable
grey
cloak
and
quite
enjoys
herself
like
the
best
of
old
girls
as
she
is
mother
says
the
trooper
when
they
are
more
composed
forgive
me
first
of
all
for
i
know
my
need
of
it
forgive
him
she
does
it
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
she
always
has
done
it
she
tells
him
how
she
has
had
it
written
in
her
will
these
many
years
that
he
was
her
beloved
son
george
she
has
never
believed
any
ill
of
him
never
if
she
had
died
without
this
happiness
and
she
is
an
old
woman
now
and
ca
look
to
live
very
long
she
would
have
blessed
him
with
her
last
breath
if
she
had
had
her
senses
as
her
beloved
son
george
mother
i
have
been
an
undutiful
trouble
to
you
and
i
have
my
reward
but
of
late
years
i
have
had
a
kind
of
glimmering
of
a
purpose
in
me
too
when
i
left
home
i
did
care
much
mother
i
am
afraid
not
a
great
deal
for
leaving
and
went
away
and
making
believe
to
think
that
i
cared
for
nobody
no
not
i
and
that
nobody
cared
for
me
the
trooper
has
dried
his
eyes
and
put
away
his
handkerchief
but
there
is
an
extraordinary
contrast
between
his
habitual
manner
of
expressing
himself
and
carrying
himself
and
the
softened
tone
in
which
he
speaks
interrupted
occasionally
by
a
sob
so
i
wrote
a
line
home
mother
as
you
too
well
know
to
say
i
had
under
another
name
and
i
went
abroad
abroad
at
one
time
i
thought
i
would
write
home
next
year
when
i
might
be
better
off
and
when
that
year
was
out
i
thought
i
would
write
home
next
year
when
i
might
be
better
off
and
when
that
year
was
out
again
perhaps
i
did
think
much
about
it
so
on
from
year
to
year
through
a
service
of
ten
years
till
i
began
to
get
older
and
to
ask
myself
why
should
i
ever
write
i
do
find
any
fault
child
but
not
to
ease
my
mind
george
not
a
word
to
your
loving
mother
who
was
growing
older
too
this
almost
overturns
the
trooper
afresh
but
he
sets
himself
up
with
a
great
rough
sounding
clearance
of
his
throat
heaven
forgive
me
mother
but
i
thought
there
would
be
small
consolation
then
in
hearing
anything
about
me
there
were
you
respected
and
esteemed
there
was
my
brother
as
i
read
in
chance
north
country
papers
now
and
then
rising
to
be
prosperous
and
famous
there
was
i
a
dragoon
roving
unsettled
not
like
him
but
all
my
earlier
advantages
thrown
away
all
my
little
learning
unlearnt
nothing
picked
up
but
what
unfitted
me
for
most
things
that
i
could
think
of
what
business
had
i
to
make
myself
known
after
letting
all
that
time
go
by
me
what
good
could
come
of
it
the
worst
was
past
with
you
mother
i
knew
by
that
time
being
a
man
how
you
had
mourned
for
me
and
wept
for
me
and
prayed
for
me
and
the
pain
was
over
or
was
softened
down
and
i
was
better
in
your
mind
as
it
was
the
old
lady
sorrowfully
shakes
her
head
and
taking
one
of
his
powerful
hands
lays
it
lovingly
upon
her
shoulder
no
i
do
say
that
it
was
so
mother
but
that
i
made
it
out
to
be
so
i
said
just
now
what
good
could
come
of
it
well
my
dear
mother
some
good
might
have
come
of
it
to
myself
and
there
was
the
meanness
of
it
you
would
have
sought
me
out
you
would
have
purchased
my
discharge
you
would
have
taken
me
down
to
chesney
wold
you
would
have
brought
me
and
my
brother
and
my
brother
family
together
you
would
all
have
considered
anxiously
how
to
do
something
for
me
and
set
me
up
as
a
respectable
civilian
but
how
could
any
of
you
feel
sure
of
me
when
i
could
so
much
as
feel
sure
of
myself
how
could
you
help
regarding
as
an
incumbrance
and
a
discredit
to
you
an
idle
dragooning
chap
who
was
an
incumbrance
and
a
discredit
to
himself
excepting
under
discipline
how
could
i
look
my
children
in
the
face
and
pretend
to
set
them
an
example
i
the
vagabond
boy
who
had
run
away
from
home
and
been
the
grief
and
unhappiness
of
my
mother
life
george
such
were
my
words
mother
when
i
passed
this
in
review
before
me
have
made
your
bed
now
lie
upon
it
rouncewell
drawing
up
her
stately
form
shakes
her
head
at
the
old
girl
with
a
swelling
pride
upon
her
as
much
as
to
say
i
told
you
so
the
old
girl
relieves
her
feelings
and
testifies
her
interest
in
the
conversation
by
giving
the
trooper
a
great
poke
between
the
shoulders
with
her
umbrella
this
action
she
afterwards
repeats
at
intervals
in
a
species
of
affectionate
lunacy
never
failing
after
the
administration
of
each
of
these
remonstrances
to
resort
to
the
whitened
wall
and
the
grey
cloak
again
this
was
the
way
i
brought
myself
to
think
mother
that
my
best
amends
was
to
lie
upon
that
bed
i
had
made
and
die
upon
it
and
i
should
have
done
it
though
i
have
been
to
see
you
more
than
once
down
at
chesney
wold
when
you
little
thought
of
me
but
for
my
old
comrade
wife
here
who
i
find
has
been
too
many
for
me
but
i
thank
her
for
it
i
thank
you
for
it
bagnet
with
all
my
heart
and
might
to
which
bagnet
responds
with
two
pokes
and
now
the
old
lady
impresses
upon
her
son
george
her
own
dear
recovered
boy
her
joy
and
pride
the
light
of
her
eyes
the
happy
close
of
her
life
and
every
fond
name
she
can
think
of
that
he
must
be
governed
by
the
best
advice
obtainable
by
money
and
influence
that
he
must
yield
up
his
case
to
the
greatest
lawyers
that
can
be
got
that
he
must
act
in
this
serious
plight
as
he
shall
be
advised
to
act
and
must
not
be
however
right
but
must
promise
to
think
only
of
his
poor
old
mother
anxiety
and
suffering
until
he
is
released
or
he
will
break
her
heart
mother
is
little
enough
to
consent
to
returns
the
trooper
stopping
her
with
a
kiss
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
and
i
make
a
late
beginning
and
do
it
bagnet
you
take
care
of
my
mother
i
know
a
very
hard
poke
from
the
old
girl
umbrella
if
you
bring
her
acquainted
with
jarndyce
and
miss
summerson
she
will
find
them
of
her
way
of
thinking
and
they
will
give
her
the
best
advice
and
assistance
and
george
says
the
old
lady
we
must
send
with
all
haste
for
your
brother
he
is
a
sensible
sound
man
as
they
tell
me
out
in
the
world
beyond
chesney
wold
my
dear
though
i
do
know
much
of
it
myself
and
will
be
of
great
service
mother
returns
the
trooper
is
it
too
soon
to
ask
a
favour
surely
not
my
dear
then
grant
me
this
one
great
favour
do
let
my
brother
know
not
know
what
my
dear
not
know
of
me
in
fact
mother
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
to
it
he
has
proved
himself
so
different
from
me
and
has
done
so
much
to
raise
himself
while
i
been
soldiering
that
i
brass
enough
in
my
composition
to
see
him
in
this
place
and
under
this
charge
how
could
a
man
like
him
be
expected
to
have
any
pleasure
in
such
a
discovery
it
impossible
no
keep
my
secret
from
him
mother
do
me
a
greater
kindness
than
i
deserve
and
keep
my
secret
from
my
brother
of
all
men
but
not
always
dear
george
why
mother
perhaps
not
for
good
and
all
though
i
may
come
to
ask
that
too
but
keep
it
now
i
do
entreat
you
if
it
ever
broke
to
him
that
his
rip
of
a
brother
has
turned
up
i
could
wish
says
the
trooper
shaking
his
head
very
doubtfully
to
break
it
myself
and
be
governed
as
to
advancing
or
retreating
by
the
way
in
which
he
seems
to
take
it
as
he
evidently
has
a
rooted
feeling
on
this
point
and
as
the
depth
of
it
is
recognized
in
bagnet
face
his
mother
yields
her
implicit
assent
to
what
he
asks
for
this
he
thanks
her
kindly
in
all
other
respects
my
dear
mother
i
be
as
tractable
and
obedient
as
you
can
wish
on
this
one
alone
i
stand
out
so
now
i
am
ready
even
for
the
lawyers
i
have
been
drawing
up
he
glances
at
his
writing
on
the
table
an
exact
account
of
what
i
knew
of
the
deceased
and
how
i
came
to
be
involved
in
this
unfortunate
affair
it
entered
plain
and
regular
like
an
not
a
word
in
it
but
what
wanted
for
the
facts
i
did
intend
to
read
it
straight
on
end
whensoever
i
was
called
upon
to
say
anything
in
my
defence
i
hope
i
may
be
let
to
do
it
still
but
i
have
no
longer
a
will
of
my
own
in
this
case
and
whatever
is
said
or
done
i
give
my
promise
not
to
have
any
matters
being
brought
to
this
so
far
satisfactory
pass
and
time
being
on
the
wane
bagnet
proposes
a
departure
again
and
again
the
old
lady
hangs
upon
her
son
neck
and
again
and
again
the
trooper
holds
her
to
his
broad
chest
where
are
you
going
to
take
my
mother
mrs
bagnet
i
am
going
to
the
town
house
my
dear
the
family
house
i
have
some
business
there
that
must
be
looked
to
directly
rouncewell
answers
will
you
see
my
mother
safe
there
in
a
coach
bagnet
but
of
course
i
know
you
will
why
should
i
ask
it
why
indeed
bagnet
expresses
with
the
umbrella
take
her
my
old
friend
and
take
my
gratitude
along
with
you
kisses
to
quebec
and
malta
love
to
my
godson
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
to
lignum
and
this
for
yourself
and
i
wish
it
was
ten
thousand
pound
in
gold
my
dear
so
saying
the
trooper
puts
his
lips
to
the
old
girl
tanned
forehead
and
the
door
shuts
upon
him
in
his
cell
no
entreaties
on
the
part
of
the
good
old
housekeeper
will
induce
bagnet
to
retain
the
coach
for
her
own
conveyance
home
jumping
out
cheerfully
at
the
door
of
the
dedlock
mansion
and
handing
rouncewell
up
the
steps
the
old
girl
shakes
hands
and
trudges
off
arriving
soon
afterwards
in
the
bosom
of
the
bagnet
family
and
falling
to
washing
the
greens
as
if
nothing
had
happened
my
lady
is
in
that
room
in
which
she
held
her
last
conference
with
the
murdered
man
and
is
sitting
where
she
sat
that
night
and
is
looking
at
the
spot
where
he
stood
upon
the
hearth
studying
her
so
leisurely
when
a
tap
comes
at
the
door
who
is
it
rouncewell
what
has
brought
rouncewell
to
town
so
unexpectedly
trouble
my
lady
sad
trouble
oh
my
lady
may
i
beg
a
word
with
you
what
new
occurrence
is
it
that
makes
this
tranquil
old
woman
tremble
so
far
happier
than
her
lady
as
her
lady
has
often
thought
why
does
she
falter
in
this
manner
and
look
at
her
with
such
strange
mistrust
what
is
the
matter
sit
down
and
take
your
breath
oh
my
lady
my
lady
i
have
found
my
son
my
youngest
who
went
away
for
a
soldier
so
long
ago
and
he
is
in
prison
for
debt
oh
no
my
lady
i
would
have
paid
any
debt
and
joyful
for
what
is
he
in
prison
then
charged
with
a
murder
my
lady
of
which
he
is
as
innocent
as
as
i
am
accused
of
the
murder
of
mr
tulkinghorn
what
does
she
mean
by
this
look
and
this
imploring
gesture
why
does
she
come
so
close
what
is
the
letter
that
she
holds
lady
dedlock
my
dear
lady
my
good
lady
my
kind
lady
you
must
have
a
heart
to
feel
for
me
you
must
have
a
heart
to
forgive
me
i
was
in
this
family
before
you
were
born
i
am
devoted
to
it
but
think
of
my
dear
son
wrongfully
accused
i
do
not
accuse
him
no
my
lady
no
but
others
do
and
he
is
in
prison
and
in
danger
oh
lady
dedlock
if
you
can
say
but
a
word
to
help
to
clear
him
say
it
what
delusion
can
this
be
what
power
does
she
suppose
is
in
the
person
she
petitions
to
avert
this
unjust
suspicion
if
it
be
unjust
her
lady
handsome
eyes
regard
her
with
astonishment
almost
with
fear
my
lady
i
came
away
last
night
from
chesney
wold
to
find
my
son
in
my
old
age
and
the
step
upon
the
ghost
walk
was
so
constant
and
so
solemn
that
i
never
heard
the
like
in
all
these
years
night
after
night
as
it
has
fallen
dark
the
sound
has
echoed
through
your
rooms
but
last
night
it
was
awfullest
and
as
it
fell
dark
last
night
my
lady
i
got
this
letter
what
letter
is
it
hush
hush
the
housekeeper
looks
round
and
answers
in
a
frightened
whisper
my
lady
i
have
not
breathed
a
word
of
it
i
do
believe
what
written
in
it
i
know
it
ca
be
true
i
am
sure
and
certain
that
it
is
not
true
but
my
son
is
in
danger
and
you
must
have
a
heart
to
pity
me
if
you
know
of
anything
that
is
not
known
to
others
if
you
have
any
suspicion
if
you
have
any
clue
at
all
and
any
reason
for
keeping
it
in
your
own
breast
oh
my
dear
lady
think
of
me
and
conquer
that
reason
and
let
it
be
known
this
is
the
most
i
consider
possible
i
know
you
are
not
a
hard
lady
but
you
go
your
own
way
always
without
help
and
you
are
not
familiar
with
your
friends
and
all
who
admire
you
and
all
do
as
a
beautiful
and
elegant
lady
know
you
to
be
one
far
away
from
themselves
who
be
approached
close
my
lady
you
may
have
some
proud
or
angry
reasons
for
disdaining
to
utter
something
that
you
know
if
so
pray
oh
pray
think
of
a
faithful
servant
whose
whole
life
has
been
passed
in
this
family
which
she
dearly
loves
and
relent
and
help
to
clear
my
son
my
lady
my
good
lady
the
old
housekeeper
pleads
with
genuine
simplicity
i
am
so
humble
in
my
place
and
you
are
by
nature
so
high
and
distant
that
you
may
not
think
what
i
feel
for
my
child
but
i
feel
so
much
that
i
have
come
here
to
make
so
bold
as
to
beg
and
pray
you
not
to
be
scornful
of
us
if
you
can
do
us
any
right
or
justice
at
this
fearful
time
lady
dedlock
raises
her
without
one
word
until
she
takes
the
letter
from
her
hand
am
i
to
read
this
when
i
am
gone
my
lady
if
you
please
and
then
remembering
the
most
that
i
consider
possible
i
know
of
nothing
i
can
do
i
know
of
nothing
i
reserve
that
can
affect
your
son
i
have
never
accused
him
my
lady
you
may
pity
him
the
more
under
a
false
accusation
after
reading
the
letter
the
old
housekeeper
leaves
her
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
in
truth
she
is
not
a
hard
lady
naturally
and
the
time
has
been
when
the
sight
of
the
venerable
figure
suing
to
her
with
such
strong
earnestness
would
have
moved
her
to
great
compassion
but
so
long
accustomed
to
suppress
emotion
and
keep
down
reality
so
long
schooled
for
her
own
purposes
in
that
destructive
school
which
shuts
up
the
natural
feelings
of
the
heart
like
flies
in
amber
and
spreads
one
uniform
and
dreary
gloss
over
the
good
and
bad
the
feeling
and
the
unfeeling
the
sensible
and
the
senseless
she
had
subdued
even
her
wonder
until
now
she
opens
the
letter
spread
out
upon
the
paper
is
a
printed
account
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
as
it
lay
face
downward
on
the
floor
shot
through
the
heart
and
underneath
is
written
her
own
name
with
the
word
murderess
attached
it
falls
out
of
her
hand
how
long
it
may
have
lain
upon
the
ground
she
knows
not
but
it
lies
where
it
fell
when
a
servant
stands
before
her
announcing
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
guppy
the
words
have
probably
been
repeated
several
times
for
they
are
ringing
in
her
head
before
she
begins
to
understand
them
let
him
come
in
he
comes
in
holding
the
letter
in
her
hand
which
she
has
taken
from
the
floor
she
tries
to
collect
her
thoughts
in
the
eyes
of
guppy
she
is
the
same
lady
dedlock
holding
the
same
prepared
proud
chilling
state
your
ladyship
may
not
be
at
first
disposed
to
excuse
this
visit
from
one
who
has
never
been
welcome
to
your
ladyship
which
he
complain
of
for
he
is
bound
to
confess
that
there
never
has
been
any
particular
reason
on
the
face
of
things
why
he
should
be
but
i
hope
when
i
mention
my
motives
to
your
ladyship
you
will
not
find
fault
with
me
says
guppy
do
so
thank
your
ladyship
i
ought
first
to
explain
to
your
ladyship
guppy
sits
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
puts
his
hat
on
the
carpet
at
his
feet
that
miss
summerson
whose
image
as
i
formerly
mentioned
to
your
ladyship
was
at
one
period
of
my
life
imprinted
on
my
until
erased
by
circumstances
over
which
i
had
no
control
communicated
to
me
after
i
had
the
pleasure
of
waiting
on
your
ladyship
last
that
she
particularly
wished
me
to
take
no
steps
whatever
in
any
manner
at
all
relating
to
her
and
miss
wishes
being
to
me
a
law
except
as
connected
with
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
i
consequently
never
expected
to
have
the
distinguished
honour
of
waiting
on
your
ladyship
again
and
yet
he
is
here
now
lady
dedlock
moodily
reminds
him
and
yet
i
am
here
now
guppy
admits
my
object
being
to
communicate
to
your
ladyship
under
the
seal
of
confidence
why
i
am
here
he
can
not
do
so
she
tells
him
too
plainly
or
too
briefly
nor
can
i
guppy
returns
with
a
sense
of
injury
upon
him
too
particularly
request
your
ladyship
to
take
particular
notice
that
it
no
personal
affair
of
mine
that
brings
me
here
i
have
no
interested
views
of
my
own
to
serve
in
coming
here
if
it
was
not
for
my
promise
to
miss
summerson
and
my
keeping
of
it
sacred
i
in
point
of
fact
should
have
darkened
these
doors
again
but
should
have
seen
further
first
guppy
considers
this
a
favourable
moment
for
sticking
up
his
hair
with
both
hands
your
ladyship
will
remember
when
i
mention
it
that
the
last
time
i
was
here
i
run
against
a
party
very
eminent
in
our
profession
and
whose
loss
we
all
deplore
that
party
certainly
did
from
that
time
apply
himself
to
cutting
in
against
me
in
a
way
that
i
will
call
sharp
practice
and
did
make
it
at
every
turn
and
point
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
be
sure
that
i
had
inadvertently
led
up
to
something
contrary
to
miss
summerson
wishes
is
no
recommendation
but
i
may
say
for
myself
that
i
am
not
so
bad
a
man
of
business
neither
lady
dedlock
looks
at
him
in
stern
inquiry
guppy
immediately
withdraws
his
eyes
from
her
face
and
looks
anywhere
else
indeed
it
has
been
made
so
hard
he
goes
on
to
have
any
idea
what
that
party
was
up
to
in
combination
with
others
that
until
the
loss
which
we
all
deplore
i
was
gravelled
an
expression
which
your
ladyship
moving
in
the
higher
circles
will
be
so
good
as
to
consider
tantamount
to
knocked
over
small
likewise
a
name
by
which
i
refer
to
another
party
a
friend
of
mine
that
your
ladyship
is
not
acquainted
with
got
to
be
so
close
and
that
at
times
it
was
easy
to
keep
one
hands
off
his
however
what
with
the
exertion
of
my
humble
abilities
and
what
with
the
help
of
a
mutual
friend
by
the
name
of
tony
weevle
who
is
of
a
high
aristocratic
turn
and
has
your
ladyship
portrait
always
hanging
up
in
his
room
i
have
now
reasons
for
an
apprehension
as
to
which
i
come
to
put
your
ladyship
upon
your
guard
first
will
your
ladyship
allow
me
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
had
any
strange
visitors
this
morning
i
mean
fashionable
visitors
but
such
visitors
for
instance
as
miss
barbary
old
servant
or
as
a
person
without
the
use
of
his
lower
extremities
carried
upstairs
similarly
to
a
guy
no
then
i
assure
your
ladyship
that
such
visitors
have
been
here
and
have
been
received
here
because
i
saw
them
at
the
door
and
waited
at
the
corner
of
the
square
till
they
came
out
and
took
half
an
hour
turn
afterwards
to
avoid
them
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
or
what
have
you
i
do
not
understand
you
what
do
you
mean
your
ladyship
i
come
to
put
you
on
your
guard
there
may
be
no
occasion
for
it
very
well
then
i
have
only
done
my
best
to
keep
my
promise
to
miss
summerson
i
strongly
suspect
from
what
small
has
dropped
and
from
what
we
have
corkscrewed
out
of
him
that
those
letters
i
was
to
have
brought
to
your
ladyship
were
not
destroyed
when
i
supposed
they
were
that
if
there
was
anything
to
be
blown
upon
it
is
blown
upon
that
the
visitors
i
have
alluded
to
have
been
here
this
morning
to
make
money
of
it
and
that
the
money
is
made
or
making
guppy
picks
up
his
hat
and
rises
your
ladyship
you
know
best
whether
there
anything
in
what
i
say
or
whether
there
nothing
something
or
nothing
i
have
acted
up
to
miss
summerson
wishes
in
letting
things
alone
and
in
undoing
what
i
had
begun
to
do
as
far
as
possible
that
sufficient
for
me
in
case
i
should
be
taking
a
liberty
in
putting
your
ladyship
on
your
guard
when
there
no
necessity
for
it
you
will
endeavour
i
should
hope
to
outlive
my
presumption
and
i
shall
endeavour
to
outlive
your
disapprobation
i
now
take
my
farewell
of
your
ladyship
and
assure
you
that
there
no
danger
of
your
ever
being
waited
on
by
me
again
she
scarcely
acknowledges
these
parting
words
by
any
look
but
when
he
has
been
gone
a
little
while
she
rings
her
bell
where
is
sir
leicester
mercury
reports
that
he
is
at
present
shut
up
in
the
library
alone
has
sir
leicester
had
any
visitors
this
morning
several
on
business
mercury
proceeds
to
a
description
of
them
which
has
been
anticipated
by
guppy
enough
he
may
go
so
all
is
broken
down
her
name
is
in
these
many
mouths
her
husband
knows
his
wrongs
her
shame
will
be
published
may
be
spreading
while
she
thinks
about
it
and
in
addition
to
the
thunderbolt
so
long
foreseen
by
her
so
unforeseen
by
him
she
is
denounced
by
an
invisible
accuser
as
the
murderess
of
her
enemy
her
enemy
he
was
and
she
has
often
often
often
wished
him
dead
her
enemy
he
is
even
in
his
grave
this
dreadful
accusation
comes
upon
her
like
a
new
torment
at
his
lifeless
hand
and
when
she
recalls
how
she
was
secretly
at
his
door
that
night
and
how
she
may
be
represented
to
have
sent
her
favourite
girl
away
so
soon
before
merely
to
release
herself
from
observation
she
shudders
as
if
the
hangman
hands
were
at
her
neck
she
has
thrown
herself
upon
the
floor
and
lies
with
her
hair
all
wildly
scattered
and
her
face
buried
in
the
cushions
of
a
couch
she
rises
up
hurries
to
and
fro
flings
herself
down
again
and
rocks
and
moans
the
horror
that
is
upon
her
is
unutterable
if
she
really
were
the
murderess
it
could
hardly
be
for
the
moment
more
intense
for
as
her
murderous
perspective
before
the
doing
of
the
deed
however
subtle
the
precautions
for
its
commission
would
have
been
closed
up
by
a
gigantic
dilatation
of
the
hateful
figure
preventing
her
from
seeing
any
consequences
beyond
it
and
as
those
consequences
would
have
rushed
in
in
an
unimagined
flood
the
moment
the
figure
was
laid
low
which
always
happens
when
a
murder
is
done
so
now
she
sees
that
when
he
used
to
be
on
the
watch
before
her
and
she
used
to
think
if
some
mortal
stroke
would
but
fall
on
this
old
man
and
take
him
from
my
way
it
was
but
wishing
that
all
he
held
against
her
in
his
hand
might
be
flung
to
the
winds
and
in
many
places
so
too
with
the
wicked
relief
she
has
felt
in
his
death
what
was
his
death
but
the
of
a
gloomy
arch
removed
and
now
the
arch
begins
to
fall
in
a
thousand
fragments
each
crushing
and
mangling
piecemeal
thus
a
terrible
impression
steals
upon
and
overshadows
her
that
from
this
pursuer
living
or
dead
obdurate
and
imperturbable
before
her
in
his
shape
or
not
more
obdurate
and
imperturbable
in
his
there
is
no
escape
but
in
death
hunted
she
flies
the
complication
of
her
shame
her
dread
remorse
and
misery
overwhelms
her
at
its
height
and
even
her
strength
of
is
overturned
and
whirled
away
like
a
leaf
before
a
mighty
wind
she
hurriedly
addresses
these
lines
to
her
husband
seals
and
leaves
them
on
her
table
if
i
am
sought
for
or
accused
of
his
murder
believe
that
i
am
wholly
innocent
believe
no
other
good
of
me
for
i
am
innocent
of
nothing
else
that
you
have
heard
or
will
hear
laid
to
my
charge
he
prepared
me
on
that
fatal
night
for
his
disclosure
of
my
guilt
to
you
after
he
had
left
me
i
went
out
on
pretence
of
walking
in
the
garden
where
i
sometimes
walk
but
really
to
follow
him
and
make
one
last
petition
that
he
would
not
protract
the
dreadful
suspense
on
which
i
have
been
racked
by
him
you
do
not
know
how
long
but
would
mercifully
strike
next
morning
i
found
his
house
dark
and
silent
i
rang
twice
at
his
door
but
there
was
no
reply
and
i
came
home
i
have
no
home
left
i
will
encumber
you
no
more
may
you
in
your
just
resentment
be
able
to
forget
the
unworthy
woman
on
whom
you
have
wasted
a
most
generous
devotion
who
avoids
you
only
with
a
deeper
shame
than
that
with
which
she
hurries
from
herself
and
who
writes
this
last
adieu
she
veils
and
dresses
quickly
leaves
all
her
jewels
and
her
money
listens
goes
downstairs
at
a
moment
when
the
hall
is
empty
opens
and
shuts
the
great
door
flutters
away
in
the
shrill
frosty
wind
chapter
lvi
pursuit
impassive
as
behoves
its
high
breeding
the
dedlock
town
house
stares
at
the
other
houses
in
the
street
of
dismal
grandeur
and
gives
no
outward
sign
of
anything
going
wrong
within
carriages
rattle
doors
are
battered
at
the
world
exchanges
calls
ancient
charmers
with
skeleton
throats
and
peachy
cheeks
that
have
a
rather
ghastly
bloom
upon
them
seen
by
daylight
when
indeed
these
fascinating
creatures
look
like
death
and
the
lady
fused
together
dazzle
the
eyes
of
men
forth
from
the
frigid
mews
come
easily
swinging
carriages
guided
by
coachmen
in
flaxen
wigs
deep
sunk
into
downy
hammercloths
and
up
behind
mount
luscious
mercuries
bearing
sticks
of
state
and
wearing
cocked
hats
broadwise
a
spectacle
for
the
angels
the
dedlock
town
house
changes
not
externally
and
hours
pass
before
its
exalted
dullness
is
disturbed
within
but
volumnia
the
fair
being
subject
to
the
prevalent
complaint
of
boredom
and
finding
that
disorder
attacking
her
spirits
with
some
virulence
ventures
at
length
to
repair
to
the
library
for
change
of
scene
her
gentle
tapping
at
the
door
producing
no
response
she
opens
it
and
peeps
in
seeing
no
one
there
takes
possession
the
sprightly
dedlock
is
reputed
in
that
city
of
the
ancients
bath
to
be
stimulated
by
an
urgent
curiosity
which
impels
her
on
all
convenient
and
inconvenient
occasions
to
sidle
about
with
a
golden
glass
at
her
eye
peering
into
objects
of
every
description
certain
it
is
that
she
avails
herself
of
the
present
opportunity
of
hovering
over
her
kinsman
letters
and
papers
like
a
bird
taking
a
short
peck
at
this
document
and
a
blink
with
her
head
on
one
side
at
that
document
and
hopping
about
from
table
to
table
with
her
glass
at
her
eye
in
an
inquisitive
and
restless
manner
in
the
course
of
these
researches
she
stumbles
over
something
and
turning
her
glass
in
that
direction
sees
her
kinsman
lying
on
the
ground
like
a
felled
tree
volumnia
pet
little
scream
acquires
a
considerable
augmentation
of
reality
from
this
surprise
and
the
house
is
quickly
in
commotion
servants
tear
up
and
down
stairs
bells
are
violently
rung
doctors
are
sent
for
and
lady
dedlock
is
sought
in
all
directions
but
not
found
nobody
has
seen
or
heard
her
since
she
last
rang
her
bell
her
letter
to
sir
leicester
is
discovered
on
her
table
but
it
is
doubtful
yet
whether
he
has
not
received
another
missive
from
another
world
requiring
to
be
personally
answered
and
all
the
living
languages
and
all
the
dead
are
as
one
to
him
they
lay
him
down
upon
his
bed
and
chafe
and
rub
and
fan
and
put
ice
to
his
head
and
try
every
means
of
restoration
howbeit
the
day
has
ebbed
away
and
it
is
night
in
his
room
before
his
stertorous
breathing
lulls
or
his
fixed
eyes
show
any
consciousness
of
the
candle
that
is
occasionally
passed
before
them
but
when
this
change
begins
it
goes
on
and
by
and
by
he
nods
or
moves
his
eyes
or
even
his
hand
in
token
that
he
hears
and
comprehends
he
fell
down
this
morning
a
handsome
stately
gentleman
somewhat
infirm
but
of
a
fine
presence
and
with
a
face
he
lies
upon
his
bed
an
aged
man
with
sunken
cheeks
the
decrepit
shadow
of
himself
his
voice
was
rich
and
mellow
and
he
had
so
long
been
thoroughly
persuaded
of
the
weight
and
import
to
mankind
of
any
word
he
said
that
his
words
really
had
come
to
sound
as
if
there
were
something
in
them
but
now
he
can
only
whisper
and
what
he
whispers
sounds
like
what
it
is
mere
jumble
and
jargon
his
favourite
and
faithful
housekeeper
stands
at
his
bedside
it
is
the
first
act
he
notices
and
he
clearly
derives
pleasure
from
it
after
vainly
trying
to
make
himself
understood
in
speech
he
makes
signs
for
a
pencil
so
inexpressively
that
they
can
not
at
first
understand
him
it
is
his
old
housekeeper
who
makes
out
what
he
wants
and
brings
in
a
slate
after
pausing
for
some
time
he
slowly
scrawls
upon
it
in
a
hand
that
is
not
his
chesney
wold
no
she
tells
him
he
is
in
london
he
was
taken
ill
in
the
library
this
morning
right
thankful
she
is
that
she
happened
to
come
to
london
and
is
able
to
attend
upon
him
it
is
not
an
illness
of
any
serious
consequence
sir
leicester
you
will
be
much
better
sir
leicester
all
the
gentlemen
say
so
this
with
the
tears
coursing
down
her
fair
old
face
after
making
a
survey
of
the
room
and
looking
with
particular
attention
all
round
the
bed
where
the
doctors
stand
he
writes
my
lady
my
lady
went
out
sir
leicester
before
you
were
taken
ill
and
do
know
of
your
illness
yet
he
points
again
in
great
agitation
at
the
two
words
they
all
try
to
quiet
him
but
he
points
again
with
increased
agitation
on
their
looking
at
one
another
not
knowing
what
to
say
he
takes
the
slate
once
more
and
writes
my
lady
for
god
sake
where
and
makes
an
imploring
moan
it
is
thought
better
that
his
old
housekeeper
should
give
him
lady
dedlock
letter
the
contents
of
which
no
one
knows
or
can
surmise
she
opens
it
for
him
and
puts
it
out
for
his
perusal
having
read
it
twice
by
a
great
effort
he
turns
it
down
so
that
it
shall
not
be
seen
and
lies
moaning
he
passes
into
a
kind
of
relapse
or
into
a
swoon
and
it
is
an
hour
before
he
opens
his
eyes
reclining
on
his
faithful
and
attached
old
servant
arm
the
doctors
know
that
he
is
best
with
her
and
when
not
actively
engaged
about
him
stand
aloof
the
slate
comes
into
requisition
again
but
the
word
he
wants
to
write
he
can
not
remember
his
anxiety
his
eagerness
and
affliction
at
this
pass
are
pitiable
to
behold
it
seems
as
if
he
must
go
mad
in
the
necessity
he
feels
for
haste
and
the
inability
under
which
he
labours
of
expressing
to
do
what
or
to
fetch
whom
he
has
written
the
letter
b
and
there
stopped
of
a
sudden
in
the
height
of
his
misery
he
puts
before
it
the
old
housekeeper
suggests
bucket
thank
heaven
that
his
meaning
bucket
is
found
to
be
downstairs
by
appointment
shall
he
come
up
there
is
no
possibility
of
misconstruing
sir
leicester
burning
wish
to
see
him
or
the
desire
he
signifies
to
have
the
room
cleared
of
every
one
but
the
housekeeper
it
is
speedily
done
and
bucket
appears
of
all
men
upon
earth
sir
leicester
seems
fallen
from
his
high
estate
to
place
his
sole
trust
and
reliance
upon
this
man
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
sorry
to
see
you
like
this
i
hope
you
cheer
up
i
sure
you
will
on
account
of
the
family
credit
sir
leicester
puts
her
letter
in
his
hands
and
looks
intently
in
his
face
while
he
reads
it
a
new
intelligence
comes
into
eye
as
he
reads
on
with
one
hook
of
his
finger
while
that
eye
is
still
glancing
over
the
words
he
indicates
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
understand
you
sir
leicester
writes
upon
the
slate
full
forgiveness
find
bucket
stops
his
hand
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
find
her
but
my
search
after
her
must
be
begun
out
of
hand
not
a
minute
must
be
lost
with
the
quickness
of
thought
he
follows
sir
leicester
look
towards
a
little
box
upon
a
table
bring
it
here
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
certainly
open
it
with
one
of
these
here
keys
certainly
the
littlest
key
to
be
sure
take
the
notes
out
so
i
will
count
that
soon

twenty
and
thirty
fifty
and
twenty

i
wo
the
velocity
and
certainty
of
bucket
interpretation
on
all
these
heads
is
little
short
of
miraculous
rouncewell
who
holds
the
light
is
giddy
with
the
swiftness
of
his
eyes
and
hands
as
he
starts
up
furnished
for
his
journey
you

already
on
and
buttoning
his
coat

character

tidy
one

on
that
occasion

old
lady
and
you
a
mother
and
son
the
pair
of
you
as

be
showed
for
models
in
a
caravan
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
what
you
trusted
to
me
i
go
through
with
do
you
be
afraid
of
my
turning
out
of
my
way
right
or

or
taking

sleep
or
a
wash
or
a
shave
till

your
part

leicester
dedlock
baronet
i
will
and
i
wish

better
and
these
family
affairs
smoothed
over
as
lord
many
other
family
affairs
equally
has
been
and
equally
will
be
to
the
end
of
time
with
this
peroration
bucket
buttoned
up
goes
quietly
out
looking
steadily
before
him
as
if
he
were
already
piercing
the
night
in
quest
of
the
fugitive
his
first
step
is
to
take
himself
to
lady
dedlock
rooms
and
look
all
over
them
for
any
trifling
indication
that
may
help
him
the
rooms
are
in
darkness
now
and
to
see
bucket
with
a
in
his
hand
holding
it
above
his
head
and
taking
a
sharp
mental
inventory
of
the
many
delicate
objects
so
curiously
at
variance
with
himself
would
be
to
see
a
sight
which
nobody
does
see
as
he
is
particular
to
lock
himself
in
a
spicy
boudoir
this
says
bucket
who
feels
in
a
manner
furbished
up
in
his
french
by
the
blow
of
the
morning
must
have
cost
a
sight
of
money
rum
articles
to
cut
away
from
these
she
must
have
been
hard
put
to
it
opening
and
shutting
and
looking
into
caskets
and
he
sees
the
reflection
of
himself
in
various
mirrors
and
moralizes
thereon
one
might
suppose
i
was
in
the
fashionable
circles
and
getting
myself
up
for
almac
says
bucket
i
begin
to
think
i
must
be
a
swell
in
the
guards
without
knowing
it
ever
looking
about
he
has
opened
a
dainty
little
chest
in
an
inner
drawer
his
great
hand
turning
over
some
gloves
which
it
can
scarcely
feel
they
are
so
light
and
soft
within
it
comes
upon
a
white
handkerchief
hum
let
have
a
look
at
you
says
bucket
putting
down
the
light
what
should
you
be
kept
by
yourself
for
what
your
motive
are
you
her
ladyship
property
or
somebody
else
you
got
a
mark
upon
you
somewheres
or
another
i
suppose
he
finds
it
as
he
speaks
esther
summerson
oh
says
bucket
pausing
with
his
finger
at
his
ear
come
i
take
you
he
completes
his
observations
as
quietly
and
carefully
as
he
has
carried
them
on
leaves
everything
else
precisely
as
he
found
it
glides
away
after
some
five
minutes
in
all
and
passes
into
the
street
with
a
glance
upward
at
the
dimly
lighted
windows
of
sir
leicester
room
he
sets
off
to
the
nearest
picks
out
the
horse
for
his
money
and
directs
to
be
driven
to
the
shooting
gallery
bucket
does
not
claim
to
be
a
scientific
judge
of
horses
but
he
lays
out
a
little
money
on
the
principal
events
in
that
line
and
generally
sums
up
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
in
the
remark
that
when
he
sees
a
horse
as
can
go
he
knows
him
his
knowledge
is
not
at
fault
in
the
present
instance
clattering
over
the
stones
at
a
dangerous
pace
yet
thoughtfully
bringing
his
keen
eyes
to
bear
on
every
slinking
creature
whom
he
passes
in
the
midnight
streets
and
even
on
the
lights
in
upper
windows
where
people
are
going
or
gone
to
bed
and
on
all
the
turnings
that
he
rattles
by
and
alike
on
the
heavy
sky
and
on
the
earth
where
the
snow
lies
thin
for
something
may
present
itself
to
assist
him
anywhere
he
dashes
to
his
destination
at
such
a
speed
that
when
he
stops
the
horse
half
smothers
him
in
a
cloud
of
steam
unbear
him
half
a
moment
to
freshen
him
up
and
i
be
back
he
runs
up
the
long
wooden
entry
and
finds
the
trooper
smoking
his
pipe
i
thought
i
should
george
after
what
you
have
gone
through
my
lad
i
have
a
word
to
spare
now

summerson

here

the
address
near
oxford
street

wo
repent
it
george
good
night
he
is
off
again
with
an
impression
of
having
seen
phil
sitting
by
the
frosty
fire
staring
at
him
and
gallops
away
again
and
gets
out
in
a
cloud
of
steam
again

greatest
attention

gentleman
of
a
humane
heart
and
under
such
pressing
circumstances
as

dangerous

dangerous
now
and
if
ever
you
could
afterwards
forgive
yourself
for
causing
it
this
is
the
time
eight
or
ten
hours
worth
as
i
tell
you

hundred
pound
apiece
at
least

been
lost
since
lady

disappeared
i
am
charged
to
find
her
i
am
inspector
bucket
besides
all
the
rest
that
heavy
on
her
she
has
upon
her
as
she
believes
suspicion
of
murder
if
i
follow
her
alone
she
being
in
ignorance
of
what
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
has
communicated
to
me
may
be
driven
to
desperation
but
if
i
follow
her
in
company
with
a
young
lady
answering
to
the
description
of
a
young
lady
that
she
has
a
tenderness
for

ask
no
question
and
i
say
no
more
than
that
she
will
give
me
credit
for
being
friendly
let
me
come
up
with
her
and
be
able
to
have
the
hold
upon

of
putting
that
young
lady
and
i
save
her
and
prevail
with
her
if

alive
let
me
come
up
with
her
alone
a
hard
matter
and
i
do

best
but
i
answer
for
what
the
best

be
time

it
getting
on
for
one
when
one
strikes
there
another
hour
gone
and
it
worth
a
thousand
pound
now
instead
of
a
hundred
this
is
all
true
and
the
pressing
nature
of
the
case
can
not
be
questioned
jarndyce
begs
him
to
remain
there
while
he
speaks
to
miss
summerson
bucket
says
he
will
but
acting
on
his
usual
principle
does
no
such
thing
following
upstairs
instead
and
keeping
his
man
in
sight
so
he
remains
dodging
and
lurking
about
in
the
gloom
of
the
staircase
while
they
confer
in
a
very
little
time
jarndyce
comes
down
and
tells
him
that
miss
summerson
will
join
him
directly
and
place
herself
under
his
protection
to
accompany
him
where
he
pleases
bucket
satisfied
expresses
high
approval
and
awaits
her
coming
at
the
door
there
he
mounts
a
high
tower
in
his
mind
and
looks
out
far
and
wide
many
solitary
figures
he
perceives
creeping
through
the
streets
many
solitary
figures
out
on
heaths
and
roads
and
lying
under
haystacks
but
the
figure
that
he
seeks
is
not
among
them
other
solitaries
he
perceives
in
nooks
of
bridges
looking
over
and
in
shadowed
places
down
by
the
river
level
and
a
dark
dark
shapeless
object
drifting
with
the
tide
more
solitary
than
all
clings
with
a
drowning
hold
on
his
attention
where
is
she
living
or
dead
where
is
she
if
as
he
folds
the
handkerchief
and
carefully
puts
it
up
it
were
able
with
an
enchanted
power
to
bring
before
him
the
place
where
she
found
it
and
the
near
the
cottage
where
it
covered
the
little
child
would
he
descry
her
there
on
the
waste
where
the
are
burning
with
a
pale
blue
flare
where
the
of
the
wretched
huts
in
which
the
bricks
are
made
are
being
scattered
by
the
wind
where
the
clay
and
water
are
hard
frozen
and
the
mill
in
which
the
gaunt
blind
horse
goes
round
all
day
looks
like
an
instrument
of
human
torture
traversing
this
deserted
blighted
spot
there
is
a
lonely
figure
with
the
sad
world
to
itself
pelted
by
the
snow
and
driven
by
the
wind
and
cast
out
it
would
seem
from
all
companionship
it
is
the
figure
of
a
woman
too
but
it
is
miserably
dressed
and
no
such
clothes
ever
came
through
the
hall
and
out
at
the
great
door
of
the
dedlock
mansion
chapter
lvii
esther
narrative
i
had
gone
to
bed
and
fallen
asleep
when
my
guardian
knocked
at
the
door
of
my
room
and
begged
me
to
get
up
directly
on
my
hurrying
to
speak
to
him
and
learn
what
had
happened
he
told
me
after
a
word
or
two
of
preparation
that
there
had
been
a
discovery
at
sir
leicester
dedlock
that
my
mother
had
fled
that
a
person
was
now
at
our
door
who
was
empowered
to
convey
to
her
the
fullest
assurances
of
affectionate
protection
and
forgiveness
if
he
could
possibly
find
her
and
that
i
was
sought
for
to
accompany
him
in
the
hope
that
my
entreaties
might
prevail
upon
her
if
his
failed
something
to
this
general
purpose
i
made
out
but
i
was
thrown
into
such
a
tumult
of
alarm
and
hurry
and
distress
that
in
spite
of
every
effort
i
could
make
to
subdue
my
agitation
i
did
not
seem
to
myself
fully
to
recover
my
right
mind
until
hours
had
passed
but
i
dressed
and
wrapped
up
expeditiously
without
waking
charley
or
any
one
and
went
down
to
bucket
who
was
the
person
entrusted
with
the
secret
in
taking
me
to
him
my
guardian
told
me
this
and
also
explained
how
it
was
that
he
had
come
to
think
of
me
bucket
in
a
low
voice
by
the
light
of
my
guardian
candle
read
to
me
in
the
hall
a
letter
that
my
mother
had
left
upon
her
table
and
i
suppose
within
ten
minutes
of
my
having
been
aroused
i
was
sitting
beside
him
rolling
swiftly
through
the
streets
his
manner
was
very
keen
and
yet
considerate
when
he
explained
to
me
that
a
great
deal
might
depend
on
my
being
able
to
answer
without
confusion
a
few
questions
that
he
wished
to
ask
me
these
were
chiefly
whether
i
had
had
much
communication
with
my
mother
to
whom
he
only
referred
as
lady
dedlock
when
and
where
i
had
spoken
with
her
last
and
how
she
had
become
possessed
of
my
handkerchief
when
i
had
satisfied
him
on
these
points
he
asked
me
particularly
to
consider
taking
time
to
think
whether
within
my
knowledge
there
was
any
one
no
matter
where
in
whom
she
might
be
at
all
likely
to
confide
under
circumstances
of
the
last
necessity
i
could
think
of
no
one
but
my
guardian
but
by
and
by
i
mentioned
boythorn
he
came
into
my
mind
as
connected
with
his
old
chivalrous
manner
of
mentioning
my
mother
name
and
with
what
my
guardian
had
informed
me
of
his
engagement
to
her
sister
and
his
unconscious
connexion
with
her
unhappy
story
my
companion
had
stopped
the
driver
while
we
held
this
conversation
that
we
might
the
better
hear
each
other
he
now
told
him
to
go
on
again
and
said
to
me
after
considering
within
himself
for
a
few
moments
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
how
to
proceed
he
was
quite
willing
to
tell
me
what
his
plan
was
but
i
did
not
feel
clear
enough
to
understand
it
we
had
not
driven
very
far
from
our
lodgings
when
we
stopped
in
a
at
a
place
lighted
up
with
gas
bucket
took
me
in
and
sat
me
in
an
by
a
bright
fire
it
was
now
past
one
as
i
saw
by
the
clock
against
the
wall
two
police
officers
looking
in
their
perfectly
neat
uniform
not
at
all
like
people
who
were
up
all
night
were
quietly
writing
at
a
desk
and
the
place
seemed
very
quiet
altogether
except
for
some
beating
and
calling
out
at
distant
doors
underground
to
which
nobody
paid
any
attention
a
third
man
in
uniform
whom
bucket
called
and
to
whom
he
whispered
his
instructions
went
out
and
then
the
two
others
advised
together
while
one
wrote
from
bucket
subdued
dictation
it
was
a
description
of
my
mother
that
they
were
busy
with
for
bucket
brought
it
to
me
when
it
was
done
and
read
it
in
a
whisper
it
was
very
accurate
indeed
the
second
officer
who
had
attended
to
it
closely
then
copied
it
out
and
called
in
another
man
in
uniform
there
were
several
in
an
outer
room
who
took
it
up
and
went
away
with
it
all
this
was
done
with
the
greatest
dispatch
and
without
the
waste
of
a
moment
yet
nobody
was
at
all
hurried
as
soon
as
the
paper
was
sent
out
upon
its
travels
the
two
officers
resumed
their
former
quiet
work
of
writing
with
neatness
and
care
bucket
thoughtfully
came
and
warmed
the
soles
of
his
boots
first
one
and
then
the
other
at
the
fire
are
you
well
wrapped
up
miss
summerson
he
asked
me
as
his
eyes
met
mine
it
a
desperate
sharp
night
for
a
young
lady
to
be
out
in
i
told
him
i
cared
for
no
weather
and
was
warmly
clothed
it
may
be
a
long
job
he
observed
but
so
that
it
ends
well
never
mind
miss
i
pray
to
heaven
it
may
end
well
said
i
he
nodded
comfortingly
you
see
whatever
you
do
do
you
go
and
fret
yourself
you
keep
yourself
cool
and
equal
for
anything
that
may
happen
and
it
be
the
better
for
you
the
better
for
me
the
better
for
lady
dedlock
and
the
better
for
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
he
was
really
very
kind
and
gentle
and
as
he
stood
before
the
fire
warming
his
boots
and
rubbing
his
face
with
his
forefinger
i
felt
a
confidence
in
his
sagacity
which
reassured
me
it
was
not
yet
a
quarter
to
two
when
i
heard
horses
feet
and
wheels
outside
now
miss
summerson
said
he
we
are
off
if
you
please
he
gave
me
his
arm
and
the
two
officers
courteously
bowed
me
out
and
we
found
at
the
door
a
phaeton
or
barouche
with
a
postilion
and
post
horses
bucket
handed
me
in
and
took
his
own
seat
on
the
box
the
man
in
uniform
whom
he
had
sent
to
fetch
this
equipage
then
handed
him
up
a
dark
lantern
at
his
request
and
when
he
had
given
a
few
directions
to
the
driver
we
rattled
away
i
was
far
from
sure
that
i
was
not
in
a
dream
we
rattled
with
great
rapidity
through
such
a
labyrinth
of
streets
that
i
soon
lost
all
idea
where
we
were
except
that
we
had
crossed
and
the
river
and
still
seemed
to
be
traversing
a
waterside
dense
neighbourhood
of
narrow
thoroughfares
chequered
by
docks
and
basins
high
piles
of
warehouses
and
masts
of
ships
at
length
we
stopped
at
the
corner
of
a
little
slimy
turning
which
the
wind
from
the
river
rushing
up
it
did
not
purify
and
i
saw
my
companion
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
in
conference
with
several
men
who
looked
like
a
mixture
of
police
and
sailors
against
the
mouldering
wall
by
which
they
stood
there
was
a
bill
on
which
i
could
discern
the
words
found
drowned
and
this
and
an
inscription
about
drags
possessed
me
with
the
awful
suspicion
shadowed
forth
in
our
visit
to
that
place
i
had
no
need
to
remind
myself
that
i
was
not
there
by
the
indulgence
of
any
feeling
of
mine
to
increase
the
difficulties
of
the
search
or
to
lessen
its
hopes
or
enhance
its
delays
i
remained
quiet
but
what
i
suffered
in
that
dreadful
spot
i
never
can
forget
and
still
it
was
like
the
horror
of
a
dream
a
man
yet
dark
and
muddy
in
long
swollen
sodden
boots
and
a
hat
like
them
was
called
out
of
a
boat
and
whispered
with
bucket
who
went
away
with
him
down
some
slippery
steps
as
if
to
look
at
something
secret
that
he
had
to
show
they
came
back
wiping
their
hands
upon
their
coats
after
turning
over
something
wet
but
thank
god
it
was
not
what
i
feared
after
some
further
conference
bucket
whom
everybody
seemed
to
know
and
defer
to
went
in
with
the
others
at
a
door
and
left
me
in
the
carriage
while
the
driver
walked
up
and
down
by
his
horses
to
warm
himself
the
tide
was
coming
in
as
i
judged
from
the
sound
it
made
and
i
could
hear
it
break
at
the
end
of
the
alley
with
a
little
rush
towards
me
it
never
did
so
and
i
thought
it
did
so
hundreds
of
times
in
what
can
have
been
at
the
most
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
probably
was
less
but
the
thought
shuddered
through
me
that
it
would
cast
my
mother
at
the
horses
feet
bucket
came
out
again
exhorting
the
others
to
be
vigilant
darkened
his
lantern
and
once
more
took
his
seat
do
you
be
alarmed
miss
summerson
on
account
of
our
coming
down
here
he
said
turning
to
me
i
only
want
to
have
everything
in
train
and
to
know
that
it
is
in
train
by
looking
after
it
myself
get
on
my
lad
we
appeared
to
retrace
the
way
we
had
come
not
that
i
had
taken
note
of
any
particular
objects
in
my
perturbed
state
of
mind
but
judging
from
the
general
character
of
the
streets
we
called
at
another
office
or
station
for
a
minute
and
crossed
the
river
again
during
the
whole
of
this
time
and
during
the
whole
search
my
companion
wrapped
up
on
the
box
never
relaxed
in
his
vigilance
a
single
moment
but
when
we
crossed
the
bridge
he
seemed
if
possible
to
be
more
on
the
alert
than
before
he
stood
up
to
look
over
the
parapet
he
alighted
and
went
back
after
a
shadowy
female
figure
that
flitted
past
us
and
he
gazed
into
the
profound
black
pit
of
water
with
a
face
that
made
my
heart
die
within
me
the
river
had
a
fearful
look
so
overcast
and
secret
creeping
away
so
fast
between
the
low
flat
lines
of
shore
so
heavy
with
indistinct
and
awful
shapes
both
of
substance
and
shadow
so
and
mysterious
i
have
seen
it
many
times
since
then
by
sunlight
and
by
moonlight
but
never
free
from
the
impressions
of
that
journey
in
my
memory
the
lights
upon
the
bridge
are
always
burning
dim
the
cutting
wind
is
eddying
round
the
homeless
woman
whom
we
pass
the
monotonous
wheels
are
whirling
on
and
the
light
of
the
reflected
back
looks
palely
in
upon
me
a
face
rising
out
of
the
dreaded
water
clattering
and
clattering
through
the
empty
streets
we
came
at
length
from
the
pavement
on
to
dark
smooth
roads
and
began
to
leave
the
houses
behind
us
after
a
while
i
recognized
the
familiar
way
to
saint
albans
at
barnet
fresh
horses
were
ready
for
us
and
we
changed
and
went
on
it
was
very
cold
indeed
and
the
open
country
was
white
with
snow
though
none
was
falling
then
an
old
acquaintance
of
yours
this
road
miss
summerson
said
bucket
cheerfully
yes
i
returned
have
you
gathered
any
intelligence
none
that
can
be
quite
depended
on
as
yet
he
answered
but
early
times
as
yet
he
had
gone
into
every
late
or
early
where
there
was
a
light
they
were
not
a
few
at
that
time
the
road
being
then
much
frequented
by
drovers
and
had
got
down
to
talk
to
the
i
had
heard
him
ordering
drink
and
chinking
money
and
making
himself
agreeable
and
merry
everywhere
but
whenever
he
took
his
seat
upon
the
box
again
his
face
resumed
its
watchful
steady
look
and
he
always
said
to
the
driver
in
the
same
business
tone
get
on
my
lad
with
all
these
stoppages
it
was
between
five
and
six
and
we
were
yet
a
few
miles
short
of
saint
albans
when
he
came
out
of
one
of
these
houses
and
handed
me
in
a
cup
of
tea
drink
it
miss
summerson
it
do
you
good
you
beginning
to
get
more
yourself
now
ai
you
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
hoped
so
you
was
what
you
may
call
stunned
at
first
he
returned
and
lord
no
wonder
do
speak
loud
my
dear
it
all
right
she
on
ahead
i
do
know
what
joyful
exclamation
i
made
or
was
going
to
make
but
he
put
up
his
finger
and
i
stopped
myself
passed
through
here
on
foot
this
evening
about
eight
or
nine
i
heard
of
her
first
at
the
archway
toll
over
at
highgate
but
could
make
quite
sure
traced
her
all
along
on
and
off
picked
her
up
at
one
place
and
dropped
her
at
another
but
she
before
us
now
safe
take
hold
of
this
cup
and
saucer
ostler
now
if
you
was
brought
up
to
the
butter
trade
look
out
and
see
if
you
can
catch
half
a
crown
in
your
hand
one
two
three
and
there
you
are
now
my
lad
try
a
gallop
we
were
soon
in
saint
albans
and
alighted
a
little
before
day
when
i
was
just
beginning
to
arrange
and
comprehend
the
occurrences
of
the
night
and
really
to
believe
that
they
were
not
a
dream
leaving
the
carriage
at
the
and
ordering
fresh
horses
to
be
ready
my
companion
gave
me
his
arm
and
we
went
towards
home
as
this
is
your
regular
abode
miss
summerson
you
see
he
observed
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
been
asked
for
by
any
stranger
answering
the
description
or
whether
jarndyce
has
i
do
much
expect
it
but
it
might
be
as
we
ascended
the
hill
he
looked
about
him
with
a
sharp
eye
the
day
was
now
breaking
and
reminded
me
that
i
had
come
down
it
one
night
as
i
had
reason
for
remembering
with
my
little
servant
and
poor
jo
whom
he
called
toughey
i
wondered
how
he
knew
that
when
you
passed
a
man
upon
the
road
just
yonder
you
know
said
bucket
yes
i
remembered
that
too
very
well
that
was
me
said
bucket
seeing
my
surprise
he
went
on
i
drove
down
in
a
gig
that
afternoon
to
look
after
that
boy
you
might
have
heard
my
wheels
when
you
came
out
to
look
after
him
yourself
for
i
was
aware
of
you
and
your
little
maid
going
up
when
i
was
walking
the
horse
down
making
an
inquiry
or
two
about
him
in
the
town
i
soon
heard
what
company
he
was
in
and
was
coming
among
the
to
look
for
him
when
i
observed
you
bringing
him
home
here
had
he
committed
any
crime
i
asked
none
was
charged
against
him
said
bucket
coolly
lifting
off
his
hat
but
i
suppose
he
was
no
what
i
wanted
him
for
was
in
connexion
with
keeping
this
very
matter
of
lady
dedlock
quiet
he
had
been
making
his
tongue
more
free
than
welcome
as
to
a
small
accidental
service
he
had
been
paid
for
by
the
deceased
tulkinghorn
and
it
would
do
at
any
sort
of
price
to
have
him
playing
those
games
so
having
warned
him
out
of
london
i
made
an
afternoon
of
it
to
warn
him
to
keep
out
of
it
now
he
was
away
and
go
farther
from
it
and
maintain
a
bright
that
i
catch
him
coming
back
again
poor
creature
said
i
poor
enough
assented
bucket
and
trouble
enough
and
well
enough
away
from
london
or
anywhere
else
i
was
regularly
turned
on
my
back
when
i
found
him
taken
up
by
your
establishment
i
do
assure
you
i
asked
him
why
why
my
dear
said
bucket
naturally
there
was
no
end
to
his
tongue
then
he
might
as
well
have
been
born
with
a
yard
and
a
half
of
it
and
a
remnant
over
although
i
remember
this
conversation
now
my
head
was
in
confusion
at
the
time
and
my
power
of
attention
hardly
did
more
than
enable
me
to
understand
that
he
entered
into
these
particulars
to
divert
me
with
the
same
kind
intention
manifestly
he
often
spoke
to
me
of
indifferent
things
while
his
face
was
busy
with
the
one
object
that
we
had
in
view
he
still
pursued
this
subject
as
we
turned
in
at
the
ah
said
bucket
here
we
are
and
a
nice
retired
place
it
is
puts
a
man
in
mind
of
the
country
house
in
the
that
was
known
by
the
smoke
which
so
gracefully
curled
they
early
with
the
kitchen
fire
and
that
denotes
good
servants
but
what
you
always
got
to
be
careful
of
with
servants
is
who
comes
to
see
you
never
know
what
they
up
to
if
you
do
know
that
and
another
thing
my
dear
whenever
you
find
a
young
man
behind
the
you
give
that
young
man
in
charge
on
suspicion
of
being
secreted
in
a
with
an
unlawful
purpose
we
were
now
in
front
of
the
house
he
looked
attentively
and
closely
at
the
gravel
for
footprints
before
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
windows
do
you
generally
put
that
elderly
young
gentleman
in
the
same
room
when
he
on
a
visit
here
miss
summerson
he
inquired
glancing
at
skimpole
usual
chamber
you
know
mr
skimpole
said
i
what
do
you
call
him
again
returned
bucket
bending
down
his
ear
skimpole
is
it
i
often
wondered
what
his
name
might
be
skimpole
not
john
i
should
say
nor
yet
jacob
harold
i
told
him
harold
yes
he
a
queer
bird
is
harold
said
bucket
eyeing
me
with
great
expression
he
is
a
singular
character
said
i
no
idea
of
money
observed
bucket
he
takes
it
though
i
involuntarily
returned
for
answer
that
i
perceived
bucket
knew
him
why
now
i
tell
you
miss
summerson
he
replied
your
mind
will
be
all
the
better
for
not
running
on
one
point
too
continually
and
i
tell
you
for
a
change
it
was
him
as
pointed
out
to
me
where
toughey
was
i
made
up
my
mind
that
night
to
come
to
the
door
and
ask
for
toughey
if
that
was
all
but
willing
to
try
a
move
or
so
first
if
any
such
was
on
the
board
i
just
pitched
up
a
morsel
of
gravel
at
that
window
where
i
saw
a
shadow
as
soon
as
harold
opens
it
and
i
have
had
a
look
at
him
thinks
i
you
the
man
for
me
so
i
smoothed
him
down
a
bit
about
not
wanting
to
disturb
the
family
after
they
was
gone
to
bed
and
about
its
being
a
thing
to
be
regretted
that
charitable
young
ladies
should
harbour
vagrants
and
then
when
i
pretty
well
understood
his
ways
i
said
i
should
consider
a
fypunnote
well
bestowed
if
i
could
relieve
the
premises
of
toughey
without
causing
any
noise
or
trouble
then
says
he
lifting
up
his
eyebrows
in
the
gayest
way
no
use
mentioning
a
fypunnote
to
me
my
friend
because
i
a
mere
child
in
such
matters
and
have
no
idea
of
money
of
course
i
understood
what
his
taking
it
so
easy
meant
and
being
now
quite
sure
he
was
the
man
for
me
i
wrapped
the
note
round
a
little
stone
and
threw
it
up
to
him
well
he
laughs
and
beams
and
looks
as
innocent
as
you
like
and
says
i
do
know
the
value
of
these
things
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
it
sir
says
i
i
shall
be
taken
in
he
says
wo
give
me
the
right
change
i
shall
lose
it
it
no
use
to
me
lord
you
never
saw
such
a
face
as
he
carried
it
with
of
course
he
told
me
where
to
find
toughey
and
i
found
him
i
regarded
this
as
very
treacherous
on
the
part
of
skimpole
towards
my
guardian
and
as
passing
the
usual
bounds
of
his
childish
innocence
bounds
my
dear
returned
bucket
bounds
now
miss
summerson
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
that
your
husband
will
find
useful
when
you
are
happily
married
and
have
got
a
family
about
you
whenever
a
person
says
to
you
that
they
are
as
innocent
as
can
be
in
all
concerning
money
look
well
after
your
own
money
for
they
are
dead
certain
to
collar
it
if
they
can
whenever
a
person
proclaims
to
you
worldly
matters
i
a
child
you
consider
that
that
person
is
only
off
from
being
held
accountable
and
that
you
have
got
that
person
number
and
it
number
one
now
i
am
not
a
poetical
man
myself
except
in
a
vocal
way
when
it
goes
round
a
company
but
i
a
practical
one
and
that
my
experience
so
this
rule
fast
and
loose
in
one
thing
fast
and
loose
in
everything
i
never
knew
it
fail
no
more
will
you
nor
no
one
with
which
caution
to
the
unwary
my
dear
i
take
the
liberty
of
pulling
this
here
bell
and
so
go
back
to
our
business
i
believe
it
had
not
been
for
a
moment
out
of
his
mind
any
more
than
it
had
been
out
of
my
mind
or
out
of
his
face
the
whole
household
were
amazed
to
see
me
without
any
notice
at
that
time
in
the
morning
and
so
accompanied
and
their
surprise
was
not
diminished
by
my
inquiries
no
one
however
had
been
there
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
this
was
the
truth
then
miss
summerson
said
my
companion
we
ca
be
too
soon
at
the
cottage
where
those
brickmakers
are
to
be
found
most
inquiries
there
i
leave
to
you
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
make
the
naturalest
way
is
the
best
way
and
the
naturalest
way
is
your
own
way
we
set
off
again
immediately
on
arriving
at
the
cottage
we
found
it
shut
up
and
apparently
deserted
but
one
of
the
neighbours
who
knew
me
and
who
came
out
when
i
was
trying
to
make
some
one
hear
informed
me
that
the
two
women
and
their
husbands
now
lived
together
in
another
house
made
of
loose
rough
bricks
which
stood
on
the
margin
of
the
piece
of
ground
where
the
kilns
were
and
where
the
long
rows
of
bricks
were
drying
we
lost
no
time
in
repairing
to
this
place
which
was
within
a
few
hundred
yards
and
as
the
door
stood
ajar
i
pushed
it
open
there
were
only
three
of
them
sitting
at
breakfast
the
child
lying
asleep
on
a
bed
in
the
corner
it
was
jenny
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
who
was
absent
the
other
woman
rose
on
seeing
me
and
the
men
though
they
were
as
usual
sulky
and
silent
each
gave
me
a
morose
nod
of
recognition
a
look
passed
between
them
when
bucket
followed
me
in
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
woman
evidently
knew
him
i
had
asked
leave
to
enter
of
course
liz
the
only
name
by
which
i
knew
her
rose
to
give
me
her
own
chair
but
i
sat
down
on
a
stool
near
the
fire
and
bucket
took
a
corner
of
the
bedstead
now
that
i
had
to
speak
and
was
among
people
with
whom
i
was
not
familiar
i
became
conscious
of
being
hurried
and
giddy
it
was
very
difficult
to
begin
and
i
could
not
help
bursting
into
tears
liz
said
i
i
have
come
a
long
way
in
the
night
and
through
the
snow
to
inquire
after
a
lady
who
has
been
here
you
know
bucket
struck
in
addressing
the
whole
group
with
a
composed
propitiatory
face
that
the
lady
the
young
lady
means
the
lady
that
was
here
last
night
you
know
and
who
told
you
as
there
was
anybody
here
inquired
husband
who
had
made
a
surly
stop
in
his
eating
to
listen
and
now
measured
him
with
his
eye
a
person
of
the
name
of
michael
jackson
with
a
blue
welveteen
waistcoat
with
a
double
row
of
mother
of
pearl
buttons
bucket
immediately
answered
he
had
as
good
mind
his
own
business
whoever
he
is
growled
the
man
he
out
of
employment
i
believe
said
bucket
apologetically
for
michael
jackson
and
so
gets
talking
the
woman
had
not
resumed
her
chair
but
stood
faltering
with
her
hand
upon
its
broken
back
looking
at
me
i
thought
she
would
have
spoken
to
me
privately
if
she
had
dared
she
was
still
in
this
attitude
of
uncertainty
when
her
husband
who
was
eating
with
a
lump
of
bread
and
fat
in
one
hand
and
his
in
the
other
struck
the
handle
of
his
knife
violently
on
the
table
and
told
her
with
an
oath
to
mind
her
own
business
at
any
rate
and
sit
down
i
should
like
to
have
seen
jenny
very
much
said
i
for
i
am
sure
she
would
have
told
me
all
she
could
about
this
lady
whom
i
am
very
anxious
indeed
you
can
not
think
how
anxious
to
overtake
will
jenny
be
here
soon
where
is
she
the
woman
had
a
great
desire
to
answer
but
the
man
with
another
oath
openly
kicked
at
her
foot
with
his
heavy
boot
he
left
it
to
jenny
husband
to
say
what
he
chose
and
after
a
dogged
silence
the
latter
turned
his
shaggy
head
towards
me
i
not
partial
to
gentlefolks
coming
into
my
place
as
you
heerd
me
say
afore
now
i
think
miss
i
let
their
places
be
and
curious
they
ca
let
my
place
be
there
be
a
pretty
shine
made
if
i
was
to
go
them
i
think
howsoever
i
do
so
much
complain
of
you
as
of
some
others
and
i
agreeable
to
make
you
a
civil
answer
though
i
give
notice
that
i
not
to
be
drawed
like
a
badger
will
jenny
be
here
soon
no
she
wo
where
is
she
she
gone
up
to
lunnun
did
she
go
last
night
i
asked
did
she
go
last
night
ah
she
went
last
night
he
answered
with
a
sulky
jerk
of
his
head
but
was
she
here
when
the
lady
came
and
what
did
the
lady
say
to
her
and
where
is
the
lady
gone
i
beg
and
pray
you
to
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
said
i
for
i
am
in
great
distress
to
know
if
my
master
would
let
me
speak
and
not
say
a
word
of
harm
the
woman
timidly
began
your
master
said
her
husband
muttering
an
imprecation
with
slow
emphasis
will
break
your
neck
if
you
meddle
with
wot
do
concern
you
after
another
silence
the
husband
of
the
absent
woman
turning
to
me
again
answered
me
with
his
usual
grumbling
unwillingness

worse
but
she

as
i
see
the
woman
sat
with
her
arms
crossed
and
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
her
husband
had
turned
his
seat
a
little
so
as
to
face
her
and
kept
his
hand
upon
the
table
as
if
it
were
in
readiness
to
execute
his
threat
if
she
disobeyed
him
i
hope

will
not
object
to
my
asking

lady

gruffly
cried
to

hear
what
she
says
cut
it
short
and
tell
her
bad
replied
the
woman
pale
and
exhausted
very
bad
did
she
speak
much
not
much
but
her
voice
was
hoarse
she
answered
looking
all
the
while
at
her
husband
for
leave
was
she
faint
said
i
did
she
eat
or
drink
here
go
on
said
the
husband
in
answer
to
her
look
tell
her
and
cut
it
short
she
had
a
little
water
miss
and
jenny
fetched
her
some
bread
and
tea
but
she
hardly
touched
it
and
when
she
went
from
here
i
was
proceeding
when
jenny
husband
impatiently
took
me
up
when
she
went
from
here
she
went
right
away
by
the
high
road
ask
on
the
road
if
you
doubt
me
and
see
if
it
war
so
now
there
the
end
that
all
about
it
i
glanced
at
my
companion
and
finding
that
he
had
already
risen
and
was
ready
to
depart
thanked
them
for
what
they
had
told
me
and
took
my
leave
the
woman
looked
full
at
bucket
as
he
went
out
and
he
looked
full
at
her
now
miss
summerson
he
said
to
me
as
we
walked
quickly
away
they
got
her
ladyship
watch
among
that
a
positive
fact
you
saw
it
i
exclaimed
just
as
good
as
saw
it
he
returned
else
why
should
he
talk
about
his
minutes
past
and
about
his
having
no
watch
to
tell
the
time
by
twenty
minutes
he
do
usually
cut
his
time
so
fine
as
that
if
he
comes
to
it
as
much
as
he
does
now
you
see
either
her
ladyship
gave
him
that
watch
or
he
took
it
i
think
she
gave
it
him
now
what
should
she
give
it
him
for
what
should
she
give
it
him
for
he
repeated
this
question
to
himself
several
times
as
we
hurried
on
appearing
to
balance
between
a
variety
of
answers
that
arose
in
his
mind
if
time
could
be
spared
said
bucket
which
is
the
only
thing
that
ca
be
spared
in
this
case
i
might
get
it
out
of
that
woman
but
it
too
doubtful
a
chance
to
trust
to
under
present
circumstances
they
are
up
to
keeping
a
close
eye
upon
her
and
any
fool
knows
that
a
poor
creetur
like
her
beaten
and
kicked
and
scarred
and
bruised
from
head
to
foot
will
stand
by
the
husband
that
ill
uses
her
through
thick
and
thin
there
something
kept
back
it
a
pity
but
what
we
had
seen
the
other
woman
i
regretted
it
exceedingly
for
she
was
very
grateful
and
i
felt
sure
would
have
resisted
no
entreaty
of
mine
it
possible
miss
summerson
said
bucket
pondering
on
it
that
her
ladyship
sent
her
up
to
london
with
some
word
for
you
and
it
possible
that
her
husband
got
the
watch
to
let
her
go
it
come
out
altogether
so
plain
as
to
please
me
but
it
on
the
cards
now
i
do
take
kindly
to
laying
out
the
money
of
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
on
these
roughs
and
i
do
see
my
way
to
the
usefulness
of
it
at
present
no
so
far
our
road
miss
summerson
is
straight
ahead
and
keeping
everything
quiet
we
called
at
home
once
more
that
i
might
send
a
hasty
note
to
my
guardian
and
then
we
hurried
back
to
where
we
had
left
the
carriage
the
horses
were
brought
out
as
soon
as
we
were
seen
coming
and
we
were
on
the
road
again
in
a
few
minutes
it
had
set
in
snowing
at
daybreak
and
it
now
snowed
hard
the
air
was
so
thick
with
the
darkness
of
the
day
and
the
density
of
the
fall
that
we
could
see
but
a
very
little
way
in
any
direction
although
it
was
extremely
cold
the
snow
was
but
partially
frozen
and
it
churned
with
a
sound
as
if
it
were
a
beach
of
small
shells
under
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
into
mire
and
water
they
sometimes
slipped
and
floundered
for
a
mile
together
and
we
were
obliged
to
come
to
a
standstill
to
rest
them
one
horse
fell
three
times
in
this
first
stage
and
trembled
so
and
was
so
shaken
that
the
driver
had
to
dismount
from
his
saddle
and
lead
him
at
last
i
could
eat
nothing
and
could
not
sleep
and
i
grew
so
nervous
under
those
delays
and
the
slow
pace
at
which
we
travelled
that
i
had
an
unreasonable
desire
upon
me
to
get
out
and
walk
yielding
to
my
companion
better
sense
however
i
remained
where
i
was
all
this
time
kept
fresh
by
a
certain
enjoyment
of
the
work
in
which
he
was
engaged
he
was
up
and
down
at
every
house
we
came
to
addressing
people
whom
he
had
never
beheld
before
as
old
acquaintances
running
in
to
warm
himself
at
every
fire
he
saw
talking
and
drinking
and
shaking
hands
at
every
bar
and
tap
friendly
with
every
waggoner
wheelwright
blacksmith
and
yet
never
seeming
to
lose
time
and
always
mounting
to
the
box
again
with
his
watchful
steady
face
and
his
get
on
my
lad
when
we
were
changing
horses
the
next
time
he
came
from
the
with
the
wet
snow
encrusted
upon
him
and
dropping
off
him
plashing
and
crashing
through
it
to
his
wet
knees
as
he
had
been
doing
frequently
since
we
left
saint
albans
and
spoke
to
me
at
the
carriage
side
keep
up
your
spirits
it
certainly
true
that
she
came
on
here
miss
summerson
there
not
a
doubt
of
the
dress
by
this
time
and
the
dress
has
been
seen
here
still
on
foot
said
i
still
on
foot
i
think
the
gentleman
you
mentioned
must
be
the
point
she
aiming
at
and
yet
i
do
like
his
living
down
in
her
own
part
of
the
country
neither
i
know
so
little
said
i
there
may
be
some
one
else
nearer
here
of
whom
i
never
heard
that
true
but
whatever
you
do
do
you
fall
my
dear
and
do
you
worry
yourself
no
more
than
you
can
help
get
on
my
lad
the
sleet
fell
all
that
day
unceasingly
a
thick
mist
came
on
early
and
it
never
rose
or
lightened
for
a
moment
such
roads
i
had
never
seen
i
sometimes
feared
we
had
missed
the
way
and
got
into
the
ploughed
grounds
or
the
marshes
if
i
ever
thought
of
the
time
i
had
been
out
it
presented
itself
as
an
indefinite
period
of
great
duration
and
i
seemed
in
a
strange
way
never
to
have
been
free
from
the
anxiety
under
which
i
then
laboured
as
we
advanced
i
began
to
feel
misgivings
that
my
companion
lost
confidence
he
was
the
same
as
before
with
all
the
roadside
people
but
he
looked
graver
when
he
sat
by
himself
on
the
box
i
saw
his
finger
uneasily
going
across
and
across
his
mouth
during
the
whole
of
one
long
weary
stage
i
overheard
that
he
began
to
ask
the
drivers
of
coaches
and
other
vehicles
coming
towards
us
what
passengers
they
had
seen
in
other
coaches
and
vehicles
that
were
in
advance
their
replies
did
not
encourage
him
he
always
gave
me
a
reassuring
beck
of
his
finger
and
lift
of
his
eyelid
as
he
got
upon
the
box
again
but
he
seemed
perplexed
now
when
he
said
get
on
my
lad
at
last
when
we
were
changing
he
told
me
that
he
had
lost
the
track
of
the
dress
so
long
that
he
began
to
be
surprised
it
was
nothing
he
said
to
lose
such
a
track
for
one
while
and
to
take
it
up
for
another
while
and
so
on
but
it
had
disappeared
here
in
an
unaccountable
manner
and
we
had
not
come
upon
it
since
this
corroborated
the
apprehensions
i
had
formed
when
he
began
to
look
at
and
to
leave
the
carriage
at
cross
roads
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
time
while
he
explored
them
but
i
was
not
to
be
he
told
me
for
it
was
as
likely
as
not
that
the
next
stage
might
set
us
right
again
the
next
stage
however
ended
as
that
one
ended
we
had
no
new
clue
there
was
a
spacious
inn
here
solitary
but
a
comfortable
substantial
building
and
as
we
drove
in
under
a
large
gateway
before
i
knew
it
where
a
landlady
and
her
pretty
daughters
came
to
the
entreating
me
to
alight
and
refresh
myself
while
the
horses
were
making
ready
i
thought
it
would
be
uncharitable
to
refuse
they
took
me
upstairs
to
a
warm
room
and
left
me
there
it
was
at
the
corner
of
the
house
i
remember
looking
two
ways
on
one
side
to
a
open
to
a
where
the
ostlers
were
unharnessing
the
splashed
and
tired
horses
from
the
muddy
carriage
and
beyond
that
to
the
itself
across
which
the
sign
was
heavily
swinging
on
the
other
side
to
a
wood
of
dark
their
branches
were
encumbered
with
snow
and
it
silently
dropped
off
in
wet
heaps
while
i
stood
at
the
window
night
was
setting
in
and
its
bleakness
was
enhanced
by
the
contrast
of
the
pictured
fire
glowing
and
gleaming
in
the
as
i
looked
among
the
stems
of
the
trees
and
followed
the
discoloured
marks
in
the
snow
where
the
thaw
was
sinking
into
it
and
undermining
it
i
thought
of
the
motherly
face
brightly
set
off
by
daughters
that
had
just
now
welcomed
me
and
of
my
mother
lying
down
in
such
a
wood
to
die
i
was
frightened
when
i
found
them
all
about
me
but
i
remembered
that
before
i
fainted
i
tried
very
hard
not
to
do
it
and
that
was
some
little
comfort
they
cushioned
me
up
on
a
large
sofa
by
the
fire
and
then
the
comely
landlady
told
me
that
i
must
travel
no
further
but
must
go
to
bed
but
this
put
me
into
such
a
tremble
lest
they
should
detain
me
there
that
she
soon
recalled
her
words
and
compromised
for
a
rest
of
half
an
hour
a
good
endearing
creature
she
was
she
and
her
three
fair
girls
all
so
busy
about
me
i
was
to
take
hot
soup
and
broiled
fowl
while
bucket
dried
himself
and
dined
elsewhere
but
i
could
not
do
it
when
a
snug
round
table
was
presently
spread
by
the
fireside
though
i
was
very
unwilling
to
disappoint
them
however
i
could
take
some
toast
and
some
hot
negus
and
as
i
really
enjoyed
that
refreshment
it
made
some
recompense
punctual
to
the
time
at
the
end
the
carriage
came
rumbling
under
the
gateway
and
they
took
me
down
warmed
refreshed
comforted
by
kindness
and
safe
i
assured
them
not
to
faint
any
more
after
i
had
got
in
and
had
taken
a
grateful
leave
of
them
all
the
youngest
daughter
a
blooming
girl
of
nineteen
who
was
to
be
the
first
married
they
had
told
me
got
upon
the
carriage
step
reached
in
and
kissed
me
i
have
never
seen
her
from
that
hour
but
i
think
of
her
to
this
hour
as
my
friend
the
transparent
windows
with
the
fire
and
light
looking
so
bright
and
warm
from
the
cold
darkness
out
of
doors
were
soon
gone
and
again
we
were
crushing
and
churning
the
loose
snow
we
went
on
with
toil
enough
but
the
dismal
roads
were
not
much
worse
than
they
had
been
and
the
stage
was
only
nine
miles
my
companion
smoking
on
the
box
i
had
thought
at
the
last
inn
of
begging
him
to
do
so
when
i
saw
him
standing
at
a
great
fire
in
a
comfortable
cloud
of
tobacco
was
as
vigilant
as
ever
and
as
quickly
down
and
up
again
when
we
came
to
any
human
abode
or
any
human
creature
he
had
lighted
his
little
dark
lantern
which
seemed
to
be
a
favourite
with
him
for
we
had
lamps
to
the
carriage
and
every
now
and
then
he
turned
it
upon
me
to
see
that
i
was
doing
well
there
was
a
to
the
but
i
never
closed
it
for
it
seemed
like
shutting
out
hope
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
stage
and
still
the
lost
trace
was
not
recovered
i
looked
at
him
anxiously
when
we
stopped
to
change
but
i
knew
by
his
yet
graver
face
as
he
stood
watching
the
ostlers
that
he
had
heard
nothing
almost
in
an
instant
afterwards
as
i
leaned
back
in
my
seat
he
looked
in
with
his
lighted
lantern
in
his
hand
an
excited
and
quite
different
man
what
is
it
said
i
starting
is
she
here
no
no
do
deceive
yourself
my
dear
nobody
here
but
i
got
it
the
crystallized
snow
was
in
his
eyelashes
in
his
hair
lying
in
ridges
on
his
dress
he
had
to
shake
it
from
his
face
and
get
his
breath
before
he
spoke
to
me
now
miss
summerson
said
he
beating
his
finger
on
the
apron
do
you
be
disappointed
at
what
i
to
do
you
know
me
i
inspector
bucket
and
you
can
trust
me
we
come
a
long
way
never
mind
four
horses
out
there
for
the
next
stage
up
quick
there
was
a
commotion
in
the
yard
and
a
man
came
running
out
of
the
stables
to
know
if
he
meant
up
or
down
up
i
tell
you
up
ai
it
english
up
up
said
i
astonished
to
london
are
we
going
back
miss
summerson
he
answered
back
straight
back
as
a
die
you
know
me
do
be
afraid
i
follow
the
other
by
g
the
other
i
repeated
who
you
called
her
jenny
did
you
i
follow
her
bring
those
two
pair
out
here
for
a
crown
a
man
wake
up
some
of
you
you
will
not
desert
this
lady
we
are
in
search
of
you
will
not
abandon
her
on
such
a
night
and
in
such
a
state
of
mind
as
i
know
her
to
be
in
said
i
in
an
agony
and
grasping
his
hand
you
are
right
my
dear
i
wo
but
i
follow
the
other
look
alive
here
with
them
horses
send
a
man
in
the
saddle
to
the
next
stage
and
let
him
send
another
again
and
order
four
on
up
right
through
my
darling
do
you
be
afraid
these
orders
and
the
way
in
which
he
ran
about
the
yard
urging
them
caused
a
general
excitement
that
was
scarcely
less
bewildering
to
me
than
the
sudden
change
but
in
the
height
of
the
confusion
a
mounted
man
galloped
away
to
order
the
relays
and
our
horses
were
put
to
with
great
speed
my
dear
said
bucket
jumping
to
his
seat
and
looking
in
again
you
excuse
me
if
i
too
familiar
do
you
fret
and
worry
yourself
no
more
than
you
can
help
i
say
nothing
else
at
present
but
you
know
me
my
dear
now
do
you
i
endeavoured
to
say
that
i
knew
he
was
far
more
capable
than
i
of
deciding
what
we
ought
to
do
but
was
he
sure
that
this
was
right
could
i
not
go
forward
by
myself
in
search
of
i
grasped
his
hand
again
in
my
distress
and
whispered
it
to
him
of
my
own
mother
my
dear
he
answered
i
know
i
know
and
would
i
put
you
wrong
do
you
think
inspector
bucket
now
you
know
me
do
you
what
could
i
say
but
yes
then
you
keep
up
as
good
a
heart
as
you
can
and
you
rely
upon
me
for
standing
by
you
no
less
than
by
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
now
are
you
right
there
all
right
sir
off
she
goes
then
and
get
on
my
lads
we
were
again
upon
the
melancholy
road
by
which
we
had
come
tearing
up
the
miry
sleet
and
thawing
snow
as
if
they
were
torn
up
by
a
waterwheel
chapter
lviii
a
wintry
day
and
night
still
impassive
as
behoves
its
breeding
the
dedlock
town
house
carries
itself
as
usual
towards
the
street
of
dismal
grandeur
there
are
powdered
heads
from
time
to
time
in
the
little
windows
of
the
hall
looking
out
at
the
untaxed
powder
falling
all
day
from
the
sky
and
in
the

turning
itself
exotically
to

from
the
nipping
weather
out
of

it
is
given
out
that
my
lady
has
gone
down

is
expected
to
return
presently

busy

however
will
not
go
down

flitting
and
chattering
about

it
knows
that
that
poor
unfortunate
man
sir
leicester
has
been
sadly
used
it
hears
my
dear
child
all
sorts
of
shocking
things
it
makes
the
world
of
five

merry
not
to
know
that
there
is
something
wrong
at
the
dedlocks

to
augur

one
of
the
charmers
with
the
skeleton
throats
is
already
apprised
of
all
the
principal
circumstances
that
will
come
out
before
the

on

application
for
a

at

and
gloss
the
mercers
it
is
and
will
be
for
several
hours
the
topic
of
the
age
the
feature
of
the
century
the
patronesses
of
those
establishments
albeit
so
loftily
inscrutable
being
as
nicely
weighed
and
measured
there
as
any
other
article
of
the
are
perfectly
understood
in
this
new
fashion

the
rawest
hand
behind
the
counter
our
people
jones
said
blaze

to
the

in

on
engaging
him
our
people
sir
are
sheep
mere
sheep
where
two
or
three
marked
ones
go
all
the
rest
follow
keep
those
two
or
three
in
your
eye
jones
and
you
have
the
flock
so
likewise
sheen
and
gloss
to
their
jones
in
reference
to
knowing
where
to
have
the
fashionable
people
and
how
to
bring
what
they
sheen
and
gloss
choose
into
fashion
on
similar
unerring
principles
sladdery
the
librarian
and
indeed
the
great
farmer
of
gorgeous
sheep
admits
this
very
day
why
yes
sir
there
certainly
are
reports
concerning
lady
dedlock
very
current
indeed
among
my
high
connexion
sir
you
see
my
high
connexion
must
talk
about
something
sir
and
it
only
to
get
a
subject
into
vogue
with
one
or
two
ladies
i
could
name
to
make
it
go
down
with
the
whole
just
what
i
should
have
done
with
those
ladies
sir
in
the
case
of
any
novelty
you
had
left
to
me
to
bring
in
they
have
done
of
themselves
in
this
case
through
knowing
lady
dedlock
and
being
perhaps
a
little
innocently
jealous
of
her
too
sir
you
find
sir
that
this
topic
will
be
very
popular
among
my
high
connexion
if
it
had
been
a
speculation
sir
it
would
have
brought
money
and
when
i
say
so
you
may
trust
to
my
being
right
sir
for
i
have
made
it
my
business
to
study
my
high
connexion
and
to
be
able
to
wind
it
up
like
a
clock
sir
thus
rumour
thrives
in
the
capital
and
will
not
go
down
into
lincolnshire
by
five
post
meridian
horse
guards
time
it
has
even
elicited
a
new
remark
from
the
honourable
stables
which
bids
fair
to
outshine
the
old
one
on
which
he
has
so
long
rested
his
colloquial
reputation
this
sparkling
sally
is
to
the
effect
that
although
he
always
knew
she
was
the
woman
in
the
stud
he
had
no
idea
she
was
a
bolter
it
is
immensely
received
in
at
feasts
and
festivals
also
in
firmaments
she
has
often
graced
and
among
constellations
she
outshone
but
yesterday
she
is
still
the
prevalent
subject
what
is
it
who
is
it
when
was
it
where
was
it
how
was
it
she
is
discussed
by
her
dear
friends
with
all
the
genteelest
slang
in
vogue
with
the
last
new
word
the
last
new
manner
the
last
new
drawl
and
the
perfection
of
polite
indifference
a
remarkable
feature
of
the
theme
is
that
it
is
found
to
be
so
inspiring
that
several
people
come
out
upon
it
who
never
came
out
before
positively
say
things
william
buffy
carries
one
of
these
smartnesses
from
the
place
where
he
dines
down
to
the
house
where
the
whip
for
his
party
hands
it
about
with
his
to
keep
men
together
who
want
to
be
off
with
such
effect
that
the
speaker
who
has
had
it
privately
insinuated
into
his
own
ear
under
the
corner
of
his
wig
cries
order
at
the
bar
three
times
without
making
an
impression
and
not
the
least
amazing
circumstance
connected
with
her
being
vaguely
the
town
talk
is
that
people
hovering
on
the
confines
of
sladdery
high
connexion
people
who
know
nothing
and
ever
did
know
nothing
about
her
think
it
essential
to
their
reputation
to
pretend
that
she
is
their
topic
too
and
to
retail
her
at
with
the
last
new
word
and
the
last
new
manner
and
the
last
new
drawl
and
the
last
new
polite
indifference
and
all
the
rest
of
it
all
at
but
considered
equal
to
new
in
inferior
systems
and
to
fainter
stars
if
there
be
any
man
of
letters
art
or
science
among
these
little
dealers
how
noble
in
him
to
support
the
feeble
sisters
on
such
majestic
crutches
so
goes
the
wintry
day
outside
the
dedlock
mansion
how
within
it
sir
leicester
lying
in
his
bed
can
speak
a
little
though
with
difficulty
and
indistinctness
he
is
enjoined
to
silence
and
to
rest
and
they
have
given
him
some
opiate
to
lull
his
pain
for
his
old
enemy
is
very
hard
with
him
he
is
never
asleep
though
sometimes
he
seems
to
fall
into
a
dull
waking
doze
he
caused
his
bedstead
to
be
moved
out
nearer
to
the
window
when
he
heard
it
was
such
inclement
weather
and
his
head
to
be
so
adjusted
that
he
could
see
the
driving
snow
and
sleet
he
watches
it
as
it
falls
throughout
the
whole
wintry
day
upon
the
least
noise
in
the
house
which
is
kept
hushed
his
hand
is
at
the
pencil
the
old
housekeeper
sitting
by
him
knows
what
he
would
write
and
whispers
no
he
has
not
come
back
yet
sir
leicester
it
was
late
last
night
when
he
went
he
has
been
but
a
little
time
gone
yet
he
withdraws
his
hand
and
falls
to
looking
at
the
sleet
and
snow
again
until
they
seem
by
being
long
looked
at
to
fall
so
thick
and
fast
that
he
is
obliged
to
close
his
eyes
for
a
minute
on
the
giddy
whirl
of
white
flakes
and
icy
blots
he
began
to
look
at
them
as
soon
as
it
was
light
the
day
is
not
yet
far
spent
when
he
conceives
it
to
be
necessary
that
her
rooms
should
be
prepared
for
her
it
is
very
cold
and
wet
let
there
be
good
fires
let
them
know
that
she
is
expected
please
see
to
it
yourself
he
writes
to
this
purpose
on
his
slate
and
rouncewell
with
a
heavy
heart
obeys
for
i
dread
george
the
old
lady
says
to
her
son
who
waits
below
to
keep
her
company
when
she
has
a
little
leisure
i
dread
my
dear
that
my
lady
will
never
more
set
foot
within
these
walls
that
a
bad
presentiment
mother
nor
yet
within
the
walls
of
chesney
wold
my
dear
that
worse
but
why
mother
when
i
saw
my
lady
yesterday
george
she
looked
to
me
and
i
may
say
at
me
too
as
if
the
step
on
the
ghost
walk
had
almost
walked
her
down
come
come
you
alarm
yourself
with
fears
mother
no
i
do
my
dear
no
i
do
it
going
on
for
sixty
year
that
i
have
been
in
this
family
and
i
never
had
any
fears
for
it
before
but
it
breaking
up
my
dear
the
great
old
dedlock
family
is
breaking
up
i
hope
not
mother
i
am
thankful
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
be
with
sir
leicester
in
this
illness
and
trouble
for
i
know
i
am
not
too
old
nor
too
useless
to
be
a
welcomer
sight
to
him
than
anybody
else
in
my
place
would
be
but
the
step
on
the
ghost
walk
will
walk
my
lady
down
george
it
has
been
many
a
day
behind
her
and
now
it
will
pass
her
and
go
on
well
mother
dear
i
say
again
i
hope
not
ah
so
do
i
george
the
old
lady
returns
shaking
her
head
and
parting
her
folded
hands
but
if
my
fears
come
true
and
he
has
to
know
it
who
will
tell
him
are
these
her
rooms
these
are
my
lady
rooms
just
as
she
left
them
why
now
says
the
trooper
glancing
round
him
and
speaking
in
a
lower
voice
i
begin
to
understand
how
you
come
to
think
as
you
do
think
mother
rooms
get
an
awful
look
about
them
when
they
are
fitted
up
like
these
for
one
person
you
are
used
to
see
in
them
and
that
person
is
away
under
any
shadow
let
alone
being
god
knows
where
he
is
not
far
out
as
all
partings
foreshadow
the
great
final
one
so
empty
rooms
bereft
of
a
familiar
presence
mournfully
whisper
what
your
room
and
what
mine
must
one
day
be
my
lady
state
has
a
hollow
look
thus
gloomy
and
abandoned
and
in
the
inner
apartment
where
bucket
last
night
made
his
secret
perquisition
the
traces
of
her
dresses
and
her
ornaments
even
the
mirrors
accustomed
to
reflect
them
when
they
were
a
portion
of
herself
have
a
desolate
and
vacant
air
dark
and
cold
as
the
wintry
day
is
it
is
darker
and
colder
in
these
deserted
chambers
than
in
many
a
hut
that
will
barely
exclude
the
weather
and
though
the
servants
heap
fires
in
the
grates
and
set
the
couches
and
the
chairs
within
the
warm
glass
screens
that
let
their
ruddy
light
shoot
through
to
the
furthest
corners
there
is
a
heavy
cloud
upon
the
rooms
which
no
light
will
dispel
the
old
housekeeper
and
her
son
remain
until
the
preparations
are
complete
and
then
she
returns
upstairs
volumnia
has
taken
rouncewell
place
in
the
meantime
though
pearl
necklaces
and
rouge
pots
however
calculated
to
embellish
bath
are
but
indifferent
comforts
to
the
invalid
under
present
circumstances
volumnia
not
being
supposed
to
know
and
indeed
not
knowing
what
is
the
matter
has
found
it
a
ticklish
task
to
offer
appropriate
observations
and
consequently
has
supplied
their
place
with
distracting
smoothings
of
the
elaborate
locomotion
on
tiptoe
vigilant
peeping
at
her
kinsman
eyes
and
one
exasperating
whisper
to
herself
of
he
is
asleep
in
disproof
of
which
superfluous
remark
sir
leicester
has
indignantly
written
on
the
slate
i
am
not
yielding
therefore
the
chair
at
the
bedside
to
the
quaint
old
housekeeper
volumnia
sits
at
a
table
a
little
removed
sympathetically
sighing
sir
leicester
watches
the
sleet
and
snow
and
listens
for
the
returning
steps
that
he
expects
in
the
ears
of
his
old
servant
looking
as
if
she
had
stepped
out
of
an
old
to
attend
a
summoned
dedlock
to
another
world
the
silence
is
fraught
with
echoes
of
her
own
words
who
will
tell
him
he
has
been
under
his
valet
hands
this
morning
to
be
made
presentable
and
is
as
well
got
up
as
the
circumstances
will
allow
he
is
propped
with
pillows
his
grey
hair
is
brushed
in
its
usual
manner
his
linen
is
arranged
to
a
nicety
and
he
is
wrapped
in
a
responsible
his
and
his
watch
are
ready
to
his
hand
it
is
necessary
less
to
his
own
dignity
now
perhaps
than
for
her
sake
that
he
should
be
seen
as
little
disturbed
and
as
much
himself
as
may
be
women
will
talk
and
volumnia
though
a
dedlock
is
no
exceptional
case
he
keeps
her
here
there
is
little
doubt
to
prevent
her
talking
somewhere
else
he
is
very
ill
but
he
makes
his
present
stand
against
distress
of
mind
and
body
most
courageously
the
fair
volumnia
being
one
of
those
sprightly
girls
who
can
not
long
continue
silent
without
imminent
peril
of
seizure
by
the
dragon
boredom
soon
indicates
the
approach
of
that
monster
with
a
series
of
undisguisable
yawns
finding
it
impossible
to
suppress
those
yawns
by
any
other
process
than
conversation
she
compliments
rouncewell
on
her
son
declaring
that
he
positively
is
one
of
the
finest
figures
she
ever
saw
and
as
soldierly
a
looking
person
she
should
think
as
what
his
name
her
favourite
life
guardsman
the
man
she
dotes
on
the
dearest
of
creatures
who
was
killed
at
waterloo
sir
leicester
hears
this
tribute
with
so
much
surprise
and
stares
about
him
in
such
a
confused
way
that
rouncewell
feels
it
necessary
to
explain
miss
dedlock
do
speak
of
my
eldest
son
sir
leicester
but
my
youngest
i
have
found
him
he
has
come
home
sir
leicester
breaks
silence
with
a
harsh
cry
george
your
son
george
come
home
mrs
rouncewell
the
old
housekeeper
wipes
her
eyes
thank
god
yes
sir
leicester
does
this
discovery
of
some
one
lost
this
return
of
some
one
so
long
gone
come
upon
him
as
a
strong
confirmation
of
his
hopes
does
he
think
shall
i
not
with
the
aid
i
have
recall
her
safely
after
this
there
being
fewer
hours
in
her
case
than
there
are
years
in
his
it
is
of
no
use
entreating
him
he
is
determined
to
speak
now
and
he
does
in
a
thick
crowd
of
sounds
but
still
intelligibly
enough
to
be
understood
why
did
you
not
tell
me
mrs
rouncewell
it
happened
only
yesterday
sir
leicester
and
i
doubted
your
being
well
enough
to
be
talked
to
of
such
things
besides
the
giddy
volumnia
now
remembers
with
her
little
scream
that
nobody
was
to
have
known
of
his
being
rouncewell
son
and
that
she
was
not
to
have
told
but
rouncewell
protests
with
warmth
enough
to
swell
the
stomacher
that
of
course
she
would
have
told
sir
leicester
as
soon
as
he
got
better
where
is
your
son
george
mrs
rouncewell
asks
sir
leicester
rouncewell
not
a
little
alarmed
by
his
disregard
of
the
doctor
injunctions
replies
in
london
where
in
london
rouncewell
is
constrained
to
admit
that
he
is
in
the
house
bring
him
here
to
my
room
bring
him
directly
the
old
lady
can
do
nothing
but
go
in
search
of
him
sir
leicester
with
such
power
of
movement
as
he
has
arranges
himself
a
little
to
receive
him
when
he
has
done
so
he
looks
out
again
at
the
falling
sleet
and
snow
and
listens
again
for
the
returning
steps
a
quantity
of
straw
has
been
tumbled
down
in
the
street
to
deaden
the
noises
there
and
she
might
be
driven
to
the
door
perhaps
without
his
hearing
wheels
he
is
lying
thus
apparently
forgetful
of
his
newer
and
minor
surprise
when
the
housekeeper
returns
accompanied
by
her
trooper
son
george
approaches
softly
to
the
bedside
makes
his
bow
squares
his
chest
and
stands
with
his
face
flushed
very
heartily
ashamed
of
himself
good
heaven
and
it
is
really
george
rouncewell
exclaims
sir
leicester
do
you
remember
me
george
the
trooper
needs
to
look
at
him
and
to
separate
this
sound
from
that
sound
before
he
knows
what
he
has
said
but
doing
this
and
being
a
little
helped
by
his
mother
he
replies
i
must
have
a
very
bad
memory
indeed
sir
leicester
if
i
failed
to
remember
you
when
i
look
at
you
george
rouncewell
sir
leicester
observes
with
difficulty
i
see
something
of
a
boy
at
chesney
wold
i
remember
well
very
well
he
looks
at
the
trooper
until
tears
come
into
his
eyes
and
then
he
looks
at
the
sleet
and
snow
again
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
leicester
says
the
trooper
but
would
you
accept
of
my
arms
to
raise
you
up
you
would
lie
easier
sir
leicester
if
you
would
allow
me
to
move
you
if
you
please
george
rouncewell
if
you
will
be
so
good
the
trooper
takes
him
in
his
arms
like
a
child
lightly
raises
him
and
turns
him
with
his
face
more
towards
the
window
thank
you
you
have
your
mother
gentleness
returns
sir
leicester
and
your
own
strength
thank
you
he
signs
to
him
with
his
hand
not
to
go
away
george
quietly
remains
at
the
bedside
waiting
to
be
spoken
to
why
did
you
wish
for
secrecy
it
takes
sir
leicester
some
time
to
ask
this
truly
i
am
not
much
to
boast
of
sir
leicester
and
i
i
should
still
sir
leicester
if
you
was
not
so
indisposed
which
i
hope
you
will
not
be
long
i
should
still
hope
for
the
favour
of
being
allowed
to
remain
unknown
in
general
that
involves
explanations
not
very
hard
to
be
guessed
at
not
very
well
timed
here
and
not
very
creditable
to
myself
however
opinions
may
differ
on
a
variety
of
subjects
i
should
think
it
would
be
universally
agreed
sir
leicester
that
i
am
not
much
to
boast
of
you
have
been
a
soldier
observes
sir
leicester
and
a
faithful
one
george
makes
his
military
bow
as
far
as
that
goes
sir
leicester
i
have
done
my
duty
under
discipline
and
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
you
find
me
says
sir
leicester
whose
eyes
are
much
attracted
towards
him
far
from
well
george
rouncewell
i
am
very
sorry
both
to
hear
it
and
to
see
it
sir
leicester
i
am
sure
you
are
no
in
addition
to
my
older
malady
i
have
had
a
sudden
and
bad
attack
something
that
deadens
making
an
endeavour
to
pass
one
hand
down
one
side
and
confuses
touching
his
lips
george
with
a
look
of
assent
and
sympathy
makes
another
bow
the
different
times
when
they
were
both
young
men
the
trooper
much
the
younger
of
the
two
and
looked
at
one
another
down
at
chesney
wold
arise
before
them
both
and
soften
both
sir
leicester
evidently
with
a
great
determination
to
say
in
his
own
manner
something
that
is
on
his
mind
before
relapsing
into
silence
tries
to
raise
himself
among
his
pillows
a
little
more
george
observant
of
the
action
takes
him
in
his
arms
again
and
places
him
as
he
desires
to
be
thank
you
george
you
are
another
self
to
me
you
have
often
carried
my
spare
gun
at
chesney
wold
george
you
are
familiar
to
me
in
these
strange
circumstances
very
familiar
he
has
put
sir
leicester
sounder
arm
over
his
shoulder
in
lifting
him
up
and
sir
leicester
is
slow
in
drawing
it
away
again
as
he
says
these
words
i
was
about
to
add
he
presently
goes
on
i
was
about
to
add
respecting
this
attack
that
it
was
unfortunately
simultaneous
with
a
slight
misunderstanding
between
my
lady
and
myself
i
do
not
mean
that
there
was
any
difference
between
us
for
there
has
been
none
but
that
there
was
a
misunderstanding
of
certain
circumstances
important
only
to
ourselves
which
deprives
me
for
a
little
while
of
my
lady
society
she
has
found
it
necessary
to
make
a
journey
i
trust
will
shortly
return
volumnia
do
i
make
myself
intelligible
the
words
are
not
quite
under
my
command
in
the
manner
of
pronouncing
them
volumnia
understands
him
perfectly
and
in
truth
he
delivers
himself
with
far
greater
plainness
than
could
have
been
supposed
possible
a
minute
ago
the
effort
by
which
he
does
so
is
written
in
the
anxious
and
labouring
expression
of
his
face
nothing
but
the
strength
of
his
purpose
enables
him
to
make
it
therefore
volumnia
i
desire
to
say
in
your
presence
and
in
the
presence
of
my
old
retainer
and
friend
rouncewell
whose
truth
and
fidelity
no
one
can
question
and
in
the
presence
of
her
son
george
who
comes
back
like
a
familiar
recollection
of
my
youth
in
the
home
of
my
ancestors
at
chesney
wold
in
case
i
should
relapse
in
case
i
should
not
recover
in
case
i
should
lose
both
my
speech
and
the
power
of
writing
though
i
hope
for
better
things
the
old
housekeeper
weeping
silently
volumnia
in
the
greatest
agitation
with
the
freshest
bloom
on
her
cheeks
the
trooper
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
head
a
little
bent
respectfully
attentive
therefore
i
desire
to
say
and
to
call
you
all
to
witness
beginning
volumnia
with
yourself
most
solemnly
that
i
am
on
unaltered
terms
with
lady
dedlock
that
i
assert
no
cause
whatever
of
complaint
against
her
that
i
have
ever
had
the
strongest
affection
for
her
and
that
i
retain
it
undiminished
say
this
to
herself
and
to
every
one
if
you
ever
say
less
than
this
you
will
be
guilty
of
deliberate
falsehood
to
me
volumnia
tremblingly
protests
that
she
will
observe
his
injunctions
to
the
letter
my
lady
is
too
high
in
position
too
handsome
too
accomplished
too
superior
in
most
respects
to
the
best
of
those
by
whom
she
is
surrounded
not
to
have
her
enemies
and
traducers
i
dare
say
let
it
be
known
to
them
as
i
make
it
known
to
you
that
being
of
sound
mind
memory
and
understanding
i
revoke
no
disposition
i
have
made
in
her
favour
i
abridge
nothing
i
have
ever
bestowed
upon
her
i
am
on
unaltered
terms
with
her
and
i
recall
having
the
full
power
to
do
it
if
i
were
so
disposed
as
you
see
no
act
i
have
done
for
her
advantage
and
happiness
his
formal
array
of
words
might
have
at
any
other
time
as
it
has
often
had
something
ludicrous
in
it
but
at
this
time
it
is
serious
and
affecting
his
noble
earnestness
his
fidelity
his
gallant
shielding
of
her
his
generous
conquest
of
his
own
wrong
and
his
own
pride
for
her
sake
are
simply
honourable
manly
and
true
nothing
less
worthy
can
be
seen
through
the
lustre
of
such
qualities
in
the
commonest
mechanic
nothing
less
worthy
can
be
seen
in
the
gentleman
in
such
a
light
both
aspire
alike
both
rise
alike
both
children
of
the
dust
shine
equally
overpowered
by
his
exertions
he
lays
his
head
back
on
his
pillows
and
closes
his
eyes
for
not
more
than
a
minute
when
he
again
resumes
his
watching
of
the
weather
and
his
attention
to
the
muffled
sounds
in
the
rendering
of
those
little
services
and
in
the
manner
of
their
acceptance
the
trooper
has
become
installed
as
necessary
to
him
nothing
has
been
said
but
it
is
quite
understood
he
falls
a
step
or
two
backward
to
be
out
of
sight
and
mounts
guard
a
little
behind
his
mother
chair
the
day
is
now
beginning
to
decline
the
mist
and
the
sleet
into
which
the
snow
has
all
resolved
itself
are
darker
and
the
blaze
begins
to
tell
more
vividly
upon
the
room
walls
and
furniture
the
gloom
augments
the
bright
gas
springs
up
in
the
streets
and
the
pertinacious
oil
lamps
which
yet
hold
their
ground
there
with
their
source
of
life
half
frozen
and
half
thawed
twinkle
gaspingly
like
fiery
fish
out
of
water
as
they
are
the
world
which
has
been
rumbling
over
the
straw
and
pulling
at
the
bell
to
inquire
begins
to
go
home
begins
to
dress
to
dine
to
discuss
its
dear
friend
with
all
the
last
new
modes
as
already
mentioned
now
does
sir
leicester
become
worse
restless
uneasy
and
in
great
pain
volumnia
lighting
a
candle
with
a
predestined
aptitude
for
doing
something
objectionable
is
bidden
to
put
it
out
again
for
it
is
not
yet
dark
enough
yet
it
is
very
dark
too
as
dark
as
it
will
be
all
night
by
and
by
she
tries
again
no
put
it
out
it
is
not
dark
enough
yet
his
old
housekeeper
is
the
first
to
understand
that
he
is
striving
to
uphold
the
fiction
with
himself
that
it
is
not
growing
late
dear
sir
leicester
my
honoured
master
she
softly
whispers
i
must
for
your
own
good
and
my
duty
take
the
freedom
of
begging
and
praying
that
you
will
not
lie
here
in
the
lone
darkness
watching
and
waiting
and
dragging
through
the
time
let
me
draw
the
curtains
and
light
the
candles
and
make
things
more
comfortable
about
you
the
will
strike
the
hours
just
the
same
sir
leicester
and
the
night
will
pass
away
just
the
same
my
lady
will
come
back
just
the
same
i
know
it
rouncewell
but
i
am
weak
and
she
has
been
so
long
gone
not
so
very
long
sir
leicester
not
hours
yet
but
that
is
a
long
time
oh
it
is
a
long
time
he
says
it
with
a
groan
that
wrings
her
heart
she
knows
that
this
is
not
a
period
for
bringing
the
rough
light
upon
him
she
thinks
his
tears
too
sacred
to
be
seen
even
by
her
therefore
she
sits
in
the
darkness
for
a
while
without
a
word
then
gently
begins
to
move
about
now
stirring
the
fire
now
standing
at
the
dark
window
looking
out
finally
he
tells
her
with
recovered
as
you
say
rouncewell
it
is
no
worse
for
being
confessed
it
is
getting
late
and
they
are
not
come
light
the
room
when
it
is
lighted
and
the
weather
shut
out
it
is
only
left
to
him
to
listen
but
they
find
that
however
dejected
and
ill
he
is
he
brightens
when
a
quiet
pretence
is
made
of
looking
at
the
fires
in
her
rooms
and
being
sure
that
everything
is
ready
to
receive
her
poor
pretence
as
it
is
these
allusions
to
her
being
expected
keep
up
hope
within
him
midnight
comes
and
with
it
the
same
blank
the
carriages
in
the
streets
are
few
and
other
late
sounds
in
that
neighbourhood
there
are
none
unless
a
man
so
very
nomadically
drunk
as
to
stray
into
the
frigid
zone
goes
brawling
and
bellowing
along
the
pavement
upon
this
wintry
night
it
is
so
still
that
listening
to
the
intense
silence
is
like
looking
at
intense
darkness
if
any
distant
sound
be
audible
in
this
case
it
departs
through
the
gloom
like
a
feeble
light
in
that
and
all
is
heavier
than
before
the
corporation
of
servants
are
dismissed
to
bed
not
unwilling
to
go
for
they
were
up
all
last
night
and
only
rouncewell
and
george
keep
watch
in
sir
leicester
room
as
the
night
lags
tardily
on
or
rather
when
it
seems
to
stop
altogether
at
between
two
and
three
they
find
a
restless
craving
on
him
to
know
more
about
the
weather
now
he
can
not
see
it
hence
george
patrolling
regularly
every
to
the
rooms
so
carefully
looked
after
extends
his
march
to
the
looks
about
him
and
brings
back
the
best
report
he
can
make
of
the
worst
of
nights
the
sleet
still
falling
and
even
the
stone
footways
lying
in
icy
sludge
volumnia
in
her
room
up
a
retired
landing
on
the
staircase
the
second
turning
past
the
end
of
the
carving
and
gilding
a
cousinly
room
containing
a
fearful
abortion
of
a
portrait
of
sir
leicester
banished
for
its
crimes
and
commanding
in
the
day
a
solemn
yard
planted
with
shrubs
like
antediluvian
specimens
of
black
tea
is
a
prey
to
horrors
of
many
kinds
not
last
nor
least
among
them
possibly
is
a
horror
of
what
may
befall
her
little
income
in
the
event
as
she
expresses
it
of
anything
happening
to
sir
leicester
anything
in
this
sense
meaning
one
thing
only
and
that
the
last
thing
that
can
happen
to
the
consciousness
of
any
baronet
in
the
known
world
an
effect
of
these
horrors
is
that
volumnia
finds
she
can
not
go
to
bed
in
her
own
room
or
sit
by
the
fire
in
her
own
room
but
must
come
forth
with
her
fair
head
tied
up
in
a
profusion
of
shawl
and
her
fair
form
enrobed
in
drapery
and
parade
the
mansion
like
a
ghost
particularly
haunting
the
rooms
warm
and
luxurious
prepared
for
one
who
still
does
not
return
solitude
under
such
circumstances
being
not
to
be
thought
of
volumnia
is
attended
by
her
maid
who
impressed
from
her
own
bed
for
that
purpose
extremely
cold
very
sleepy
and
generally
an
injured
maid
as
condemned
by
circumstances
to
take
office
with
a
cousin
when
she
had
resolved
to
be
maid
to
nothing
less
than
ten
thousand
a
year
has
not
a
sweet
expression
of
countenance
the
periodical
visits
of
the
trooper
to
these
rooms
however
in
the
course
of
his
patrolling
is
an
assurance
of
protection
and
company
both
to
mistress
and
maid
which
renders
them
very
acceptable
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
whenever
he
is
heard
advancing
they
both
make
some
little
decorative
preparation
to
receive
him
at
other
times
they
divide
their
watches
into
short
scraps
of
oblivion
and
dialogues
not
wholly
free
from
acerbity
as
to
whether
miss
dedlock
sitting
with
her
feet
upon
the
fender
was
or
was
not
falling
into
the
fire
when
rescued
to
her
great
displeasure
by
her
guardian
genius
the
maid
how
is
sir
leicester
now
mr
george
inquires
volumnia
adjusting
her
cowl
over
her
head
why
sir
leicester
is
much
the
same
miss
he
is
very
low
and
ill
and
he
even
wanders
a
little
sometimes
has
he
asked
for
me
inquires
volumnia
tenderly
why
no
i
ca
say
he
has
miss
not
within
my
hearing
that
is
to
say
this
is
a
truly
sad
time
mr
george
it
is
indeed
miss
had
you
better
go
to
bed
you
had
a
deal
better
go
to
bed
miss
dedlock
quoth
the
maid
sharply
but
volumnia
answers
no
no
she
may
be
asked
for
she
may
be
wanted
at
a
moment
notice
she
never
should
forgive
herself
if
anything
was
to
happen
and
she
was
not
on
the
spot
she
declines
to
enter
on
the
question
mooted
by
the
maid
how
the
spot
comes
to
be
there
and
not
in
her
room
which
is
nearer
to
sir
leicester
but
staunchly
declares
that
on
the
spot
she
will
remain
volumnia
further
makes
a
merit
of
not
having
closed
an
eye
as
if
she
had
twenty
or
thirty
though
it
is
hard
to
reconcile
this
statement
with
her
having
most
indisputably
opened
two
within
five
minutes
but
when
it
comes
to
four
and
still
the
same
blank
volumnia
constancy
begins
to
fail
her
or
rather
it
begins
to
strengthen
for
she
now
considers
that
it
is
her
duty
to
be
ready
for
the
morrow
when
much
may
be
expected
of
her
that
in
fact
howsoever
anxious
to
remain
upon
the
spot
it
may
be
required
of
her
as
an
act
of
to
desert
the
spot
so
when
the
trooper
reappears
with
his
had
you
better
go
to
bed
miss
and
when
the
maid
protests
more
sharply
than
before
you
had
a
deal
better
go
to
bed
miss
dedlock
she
meekly
rises
and
says
do
with
me
what
you
think
best
george
undoubtedly
thinks
it
best
to
escort
her
on
his
arm
to
the
door
of
her
cousinly
chamber
and
the
maid
as
undoubtedly
thinks
it
best
to
hustle
her
into
bed
with
mighty
little
ceremony
accordingly
these
steps
are
taken
and
now
the
trooper
in
his
rounds
has
the
house
to
himself
there
is
no
improvement
in
the
weather
from
the
portico
from
the
eaves
from
the
parapet
from
every
ledge
and
post
and
pillar
drips
the
thawed
snow
it
has
crept
as
if
for
shelter
into
the
lintels
of
the
great
door
under
it
into
the
corners
of
the
windows
into
every
chink
and
crevice
of
retreat
and
there
wastes
and
dies
it
is
falling
still
upon
the
roof
upon
the
skylight
even
through
the
skylight
and
drip
drip
drip
with
the
regularity
of
the
walk
on
the
stone
floor
below
the
trooper
his
old
recollections
awakened
by
the
solitary
grandeur
of
a
great
house
no
novelty
to
him
once
at
chesney
wold
goes
up
the
stairs
and
through
the
chief
rooms
holding
up
his
light
at
length
thinking
of
his
varied
fortunes
within
the
last
few
weeks
and
of
his
rustic
boyhood
and
of
the
two
periods
of
his
life
so
strangely
brought
together
across
the
wide
intermediate
space
thinking
of
the
murdered
man
whose
image
is
fresh
in
his
mind
thinking
of
the
lady
who
has
disappeared
from
these
very
rooms
and
the
tokens
of
whose
recent
presence
are
all
here
thinking
of
the
master
of
the
house
upstairs
and
of
the
foreboding
who
will
tell
him
he
looks
here
and
looks
there
and
reflects
how
he
might
see
something
now
which
it
would
tax
his
boldness
to
walk
up
to
lay
his
hand
upon
and
prove
to
be
a
fancy
but
it
is
all
blank
blank
as
the
darkness
above
and
below
while
he
goes
up
the
great
staircase
again
blank
as
the
oppressive
silence
all
is
still
in
readiness
george
rouncewell
quite
orderly
and
right
sir
leicester
no
word
of
any
kind
the
trooper
shakes
his
head
no
letter
that
can
possibly
have
been
overlooked
but
he
knows
there
is
no
such
hope
as
that
and
lays
his
head
down
without
looking
for
an
answer
very
familiar
to
him
as
he
said
himself
some
hours
ago
george
rouncewell
lifts
him
into
easier
positions
through
the
long
remainder
of
the
blank
wintry
night
and
equally
familiar
with
his
unexpressed
wish
extinguishes
the
light
and
undraws
the
curtains
at
the
first
late
break
of
day
the
day
comes
like
a
phantom
cold
colourless
and
vague
it
sends
a
warning
streak
before
it
of
a
deathlike
hue
as
if
it
cried
out
look
what
i
am
bringing
you
who
watch
there
who
will
tell
him
chapter
lix
esther
narrative
it
was
three
in
the
morning
when
the
houses
outside
london
did
at
last
begin
to
exclude
the
country
and
to
close
us
in
with
streets
we
had
made
our
way
along
roads
in
a
far
worse
condition
than
when
we
had
traversed
them
by
daylight
both
the
fall
and
the
thaw
having
lasted
ever
since
but
the
energy
of
my
companion
never
slackened
it
had
only
been
as
i
thought
of
less
assistance
than
the
horses
in
getting
us
on
and
it
had
often
aided
them
they
had
stopped
exhausted
up
hills
they
had
been
driven
through
streams
of
turbulent
water
they
had
slipped
down
and
become
entangled
with
the
harness
but
he
and
his
little
lantern
had
been
always
ready
and
when
the
mishap
was
set
right
i
had
never
heard
any
variation
in
his
cool
get
on
my
lads
the
steadiness
and
confidence
with
which
he
had
directed
our
journey
back
i
could
not
account
for
never
wavering
he
never
even
stopped
to
make
an
inquiry
until
we
were
within
a
few
miles
of
london
a
very
few
words
here
and
there
were
then
enough
for
him
and
thus
we
came
at
between
three
and
four
in
the
morning
into
islington
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
suspense
and
anxiety
with
which
i
reflected
all
this
time
that
we
were
leaving
my
mother
farther
and
farther
behind
every
minute
i
think
i
had
some
strong
hope
that
he
must
be
right
and
could
not
fail
to
have
a
satisfactory
object
in
following
this
woman
but
i
tormented
myself
with
questioning
it
and
discussing
it
during
the
whole
journey
what
was
to
ensue
when
we
found
her
and
what
could
compensate
us
for
this
loss
of
time
were
questions
also
that
i
could
not
possibly
dismiss
my
mind
was
quite
tortured
by
long
dwelling
on
such
reflections
when
we
stopped
we
stopped
in
a
where
there
was
a
my
companion
paid
our
two
drivers
who
were
as
completely
covered
with
splashes
as
if
they
had
been
dragged
along
the
roads
like
the
carriage
itself
and
giving
them
some
brief
direction
where
to
take
it
lifted
me
out
of
it
and
into
a
he
had
chosen
from
the
rest
why
my
dear
he
said
as
he
did
this
how
wet
you
are
i
had
not
been
conscious
of
it
but
the
melted
snow
had
found
its
way
into
the
carriage
and
i
had
got
out
two
or
three
times
when
a
fallen
horse
was
plunging
and
had
to
be
got
up
and
the
wet
had
penetrated
my
dress
i
assured
him
it
was
no
matter
but
the
driver
who
knew
him
would
not
be
dissuaded
by
me
from
running
down
the
street
to
his
stable
whence
he
brought
an
armful
of
clean
dry
straw
they
shook
it
out
and
strewed
it
well
about
me
and
i
found
it
warm
and
comfortable
now
my
dear
said
bucket
with
his
head
in
at
the
window
after
i
was
shut
up
we
to
mark
this
person
down
it
may
take
a
little
time
but
you
do
mind
that
you
pretty
sure
that
got
a
motive
ai
you
i
little
thought
what
it
was
little
thought
in
how
short
a
time
i
should
understand
it
better
but
i
assured
him
that
i
had
confidence
in
him
so
you
may
have
my
dear
he
returned
and
i
tell
you
what
if
you
only
repose
half
as
much
confidence
in
me
as
i
repose
in
you
after
what
i
experienced
of
you
that
do
lord
you
no
trouble
at
all
i
never
see
a
young
woman
in
any
station
of
society
and
seen
many
elevated
ones
too
conduct
herself
like
you
have
conducted
yourself
since
you
was
called
out
of
your
bed
you
a
pattern
you
know
that
what
you
are
said
bucket
warmly
you
a
pattern
i
told
him
i
was
very
glad
as
indeed
i
was
to
have
been
no
hindrance
to
him
and
that
i
hoped
i
should
be
none
now
my
dear
he
returned
when
a
young
lady
is
as
mild
as
she
game
and
as
game
as
she
mild
that
all
i
ask
and
more
than
i
expect
she
then
becomes
a
queen
and
that
about
what
you
are
yourself
with
these
encouraging
words
they
really
were
encouraging
to
me
under
those
lonely
and
anxious
circumstances
he
got
upon
the
box
and
we
once
more
drove
away
where
we
drove
i
neither
knew
then
nor
have
ever
known
since
but
we
appeared
to
seek
out
the
narrowest
and
worst
streets
in
london
whenever
i
saw
him
directing
the
driver
i
was
prepared
for
our
descending
into
a
deeper
complication
of
such
streets
and
we
never
failed
to
do
so
sometimes
we
emerged
upon
a
wider
thoroughfare
or
came
to
a
larger
building
than
the
generality
well
lighted
then
we
stopped
at
offices
like
those
we
had
visited
when
we
began
our
journey
and
i
saw
him
in
consultation
with
others
sometimes
he
would
get
down
by
an
archway
or
at
a
street
corner
and
mysteriously
show
the
light
of
his
little
lantern
this
would
attract
similar
lights
from
various
dark
quarters
like
so
many
insects
and
a
fresh
consultation
would
be
held
by
degrees
we
appeared
to
contract
our
search
within
narrower
and
easier
limits
single
on
duty
could
now
tell
bucket
what
he
wanted
to
know
and
point
to
him
where
to
go
at
last
we
stopped
for
a
rather
long
conversation
between
him
and
one
of
these
men
which
i
supposed
to
be
satisfactory
from
his
manner
of
nodding
from
time
to
time
when
it
was
finished
he
came
to
me
looking
very
busy
and
very
attentive
now
miss
summerson
he
said
to
me
you
wo
be
alarmed
whatever
comes
off
i
know
it
not
necessary
for
me
to
give
you
any
further
caution
than
to
tell
you
that
we
have
marked
this
person
down
and
that
you
may
be
of
use
to
me
before
i
know
it
myself
i
do
like
to
ask
such
a
thing
my
dear
but
would
you
walk
a
little
way
of
course
i
got
out
directly
and
took
his
arm
it
ai
so
easy
to
keep
your
feet
said
bucket
but
take
time
although
i
looked
about
me
confusedly
and
hurriedly
as
we
crossed
the
street
i
thought
i
knew
the
place
are
we
in
holborn
i
asked
him
yes
said
bucket
do
you
know
this
turning
it
looks
like
chancery
lane
and
was
christened
so
my
dear
said
bucket
we
turned
down
it
and
as
we
went
shuffling
through
the
sleet
i
heard
the
clocks
strike
five
we
passed
on
in
silence
and
as
quickly
as
we
could
with
such
a
when
some
one
coming
towards
us
on
the
narrow
pavement
wrapped
in
a
cloak
stopped
and
stood
aside
to
give
me
room
in
the
same
moment
i
heard
an
exclamation
of
wonder
and
my
own
name
from
woodcourt
i
knew
his
voice
very
well
it
was
so
unexpected
and
so
i
do
know
what
to
call
it
whether
pleasant
or
painful
to
come
upon
it
after
my
feverish
wandering
journey
and
in
the
midst
of
the
night
that
i
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
from
my
eyes
it
was
like
hearing
his
voice
in
a
strange
country
my
dear
miss
summerson
that
you
should
be
out
at
this
hour
and
in
such
weather
he
had
heard
from
my
guardian
of
my
having
been
called
away
on
some
uncommon
business
and
said
so
to
dispense
with
any
explanation
i
told
him
that
we
had
but
just
left
a
coach
and
were
going
but
then
i
was
obliged
to
look
at
my
companion
why
you
see
woodcourt
he
had
caught
the
name
from
me
we
are
at
present
into
the
next
street
inspector
bucket
woodcourt
disregarding
my
remonstrances
had
hurriedly
taken
off
his
cloak
and
was
putting
it
about
me
that
a
good
move
too
said
bucket
assisting
a
very
good
move
may
i
go
with
you
said
woodcourt
i
do
know
whether
to
me
or
to
my
companion
why
lord
exclaimed
bucket
taking
the
answer
on
himself
of
course
you
may
it
was
all
said
in
a
moment
and
they
took
me
between
them
wrapped
in
the
cloak
i
have
just
left
richard
said
woodcourt
i
have
been
sitting
with
him
since
ten
last
night
oh
dear
me
he
is
ill
no
no
believe
me
not
ill
but
not
quite
well
he
was
depressed
and
faint
you
know
he
gets
so
worried
and
so
worn
sometimes
and
ada
sent
to
me
of
course
and
when
i
came
home
i
found
her
note
and
came
straight
here
well
richard
revived
so
much
after
a
little
while
and
ada
was
so
happy
and
so
convinced
of
its
being
my
doing
though
god
knows
i
had
little
enough
to
do
with
it
that
i
remained
with
him
until
he
had
been
fast
asleep
some
hours
as
fast
asleep
as
she
is
now
i
hope
his
friendly
and
familiar
way
of
speaking
of
them
his
unaffected
devotion
to
them
the
grateful
confidence
with
which
i
knew
he
had
inspired
my
darling
and
the
comfort
he
was
to
her
could
i
separate
all
this
from
his
promise
to
me
how
thankless
i
must
have
been
if
it
had
not
recalled
the
words
he
said
to
me
when
he
was
so
moved
by
the
change
in
my
appearance
i
will
accept
him
as
a
trust
and
it
shall
be
a
sacred
one
we
now
turned
into
another
narrow
street
woodcourt
said
bucket
who
had
eyed
him
closely
as
we
came
along
our
business
takes
us
to
a
here
a
certain
snagsby
what
you
know
him
do
you
he
was
so
quick
that
he
saw
it
in
an
instant
yes
i
know
a
little
of
him
and
have
called
upon
him
at
this
place
indeed
sir
said
bucket
then
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
leave
miss
summerson
with
you
for
a
moment
while
i
go
and
have
half
a
word
with
him
the
last
with
whom
he
had
conferred
was
standing
silently
behind
us
i
was
not
aware
of
it
until
he
struck
in
on
my
saying
i
heard
some
one
crying
do
be
alarmed
miss
he
returned
it
snagsby
servant
why
you
see
said
bucket
the
girl
subject
to
fits
and
has
bad
upon
her
a
most
contrary
circumstance
it
is
for
i
want
certain
information
out
of
that
girl
and
she
must
be
brought
to
reason
somehow
at
all
events
they
would
be
up
yet
if
it
was
for
her
bucket
said
the
other
man
she
been
at
it
pretty
well
all
night
sir
well
that
true
he
returned
my
light
burnt
out
show
yours
a
moment
all
this
passed
in
a
whisper
a
door
or
two
from
the
house
in
which
i
could
faintly
hear
crying
and
moaning
in
the
little
round
of
light
produced
for
the
purpose
bucket
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
the
door
was
opened
after
he
had
knocked
twice
and
he
went
in
leaving
us
standing
in
the
street
miss
summerson
said
woodcourt
if
without
obtruding
myself
on
your
confidence
i
may
remain
near
you
pray
let
me
do
so
you
are
truly
kind
i
answered
i
need
wish
to
keep
no
secret
of
my
own
from
you
if
i
keep
any
it
is
another
i
quite
understand
trust
me
i
will
remain
near
you
only
so
long
as
i
can
fully
respect
it
i
trust
implicitly
to
you
i
said
i
know
and
deeply
feel
how
sacredly
you
keep
your
promise
after
a
short
time
the
little
round
of
light
shone
out
again
and
bucket
advanced
towards
us
in
it
with
his
earnest
face
please
to
come
in
miss
summerson
he
said
and
sit
down
by
the
fire
woodcourt
from
information
i
have
received
i
understand
you
are
a
medical
man
would
you
look
to
this
girl
and
see
if
anything
can
be
done
to
bring
her
round
she
has
a
letter
somewhere
that
i
particularly
want
it
not
in
her
box
and
i
think
it
must
be
about
her
but
she
is
so
twisted
and
clenched
up
that
she
is
difficult
to
handle
without
hurting
we
all
three
went
into
the
house
together
although
it
was
cold
and
raw
it
smelt
close
too
from
being
up
all
night
in
the
passage
behind
the
door
stood
a
scared
little
man
in
a
grey
coat
who
seemed
to
have
a
naturally
polite
manner
and
spoke
meekly
downstairs
if
you
please
bucket
said
he
the
lady
will
excuse
the
front
kitchen
we
use
it
as
our
workaday
the
back
is
guster
bedroom
and
in
it
she
on
poor
thing
to
a
frightful
extent
we
went
downstairs
followed
by
snagsby
as
i
soon
found
the
little
man
to
be
in
the
front
kitchen
sitting
by
the
fire
was
snagsby
with
very
red
eyes
and
a
very
severe
expression
of
face
my
little
woman
said
snagsby
entering
behind
us
to
wave
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
my
dear
hostilities
for
one
single
moment
in
the
course
of
this
prolonged
night
here
is
inspector
bucket
woodcourt
and
a
lady
she
looked
very
much
astonished
as
she
had
reason
for
doing
and
looked
particularly
hard
at
me
my
little
woman
said
snagsby
sitting
down
in
the
remotest
corner
by
the
door
as
if
he
were
taking
a
liberty
it
is
not
unlikely
that
you
may
inquire
of
me
why
inspector
bucket
woodcourt
and
a
lady
call
upon
us
in
cook
court
cursitor
street
at
the
present
hour
i
do
know
i
have
not
the
least
idea
if
i
was
to
be
informed
i
should
despair
of
understanding
and
i
rather
not
be
told
he
appeared
so
miserable
sitting
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
i
appeared
so
unwelcome
that
i
was
going
to
offer
an
apology
when
bucket
took
the
matter
on
himself
now
snagsby
said
he
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
along
with
woodcourt
to
look
after
your
guster
my
guster
mr
bucket
cried
snagsby
go
on
sir
go
on
i
shall
be
charged
with
that
next
and
to
hold
the
candle
pursued
bucket
without
correcting
himself
or
hold
her
or
make
yourself
useful
in
any
way
asked
which
there
not
a
man
alive
more
ready
to
do
for
you
a
man
of
urbanity
and
suavity
you
know
and
you
got
the
sort
of
heart
that
can
feel
for
another
woodcourt
would
you
be
so
good
as
see
to
her
and
if
you
can
get
that
letter
from
her
to
let
me
have
it
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
as
they
went
out
bucket
made
me
sit
down
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
and
take
off
my
wet
shoes
which
he
turned
up
to
dry
upon
the
fender
talking
all
the
time
do
you
be
at
all
put
out
miss
by
the
want
of
a
hospitable
look
from
snagsby
there
because
she
under
a
mistake
altogether
she
find
that
out
sooner
than
will
be
agreeable
to
a
lady
of
her
generally
correct
manner
of
forming
her
thoughts
because
i
to
explain
it
to
her
here
standing
on
the
hearth
with
his
wet
hat
and
shawls
in
his
hand
himself
a
pile
of
wet
he
turned
to
snagsby
now
the
first
thing
that
i
say
to
you
as
a
married
woman
possessing
what
you
may
call
charms
you
know
me
if
all
those
endearing
and
cetrer
you
well
acquainted
with
the
song
because
it
in
vain
for
you
to
tell
me
that
you
and
good
society
are
strangers
charms
attractions
mind
you
that
ought
to
give
you
confidence
in
yourself
is
that
you
done
it
snagsby
looked
rather
alarmed
relented
a
little
and
faltered
what
did
bucket
mean
what
does
bucket
mean
he
repeated
and
i
saw
by
his
face
that
all
the
time
he
talked
he
was
listening
for
the
discovery
of
the
letter
to
my
own
great
agitation
for
i
knew
then
how
important
it
must
be
i
tell
you
what
he
means
go
and
see
othello
acted
that
the
tragedy
for
you
snagsby
consciously
asked
why
why
said
bucket
because
you
come
to
that
if
you
look
out
why
at
the
very
moment
while
i
speak
i
know
what
your
mind
not
wholly
free
from
respecting
this
young
lady
but
shall
i
tell
you
who
this
young
lady
is
now
come
you
what
i
call
an
intellectual
woman
with
your
soul
too
large
for
your
body
if
you
come
to
that
and
chafing
it
and
you
know
me
and
you
recollect
where
you
saw
me
last
and
what
was
talked
of
in
that
circle
you
yes
very
well
this
young
lady
is
that
young
lady
snagsby
appeared
to
understand
the
reference
better
than
i
did
at
the
time
and
toughey
him
as
you
call
jo
was
mixed
up
in
the
same
business
and
no
other
and
the
that
you
know
of
was
mixed
up
in
the
same
business
and
no
other
and
your
husband
with
no
more
knowledge
of
it
than
your
great
grandfather
was
mixed
up
by
tulkinghorn
deceased
his
best
customer
in
the
same
business
and
no
other
and
the
whole
bileing
of
people
was
mixed
up
in
the
same
business
and
no
other
and
yet
a
married
woman
possessing
your
attractions
shuts
her
eyes
and
sparklers
too
and
goes
and
runs
her
head
against
a
wall
why
i
am
ashamed
of
you
i
expected
woodcourt
might
have
got
it
by
this
time
snagsby
shook
her
head
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
is
that
all
said
bucket
excitedly
no
see
what
happens
another
person
mixed
up
in
that
business
and
no
other
a
person
in
a
wretched
state
comes
here
and
is
seen
to
your
and
between
her
and
your
there
passes
a
paper
that
i
would
give
a
hundred
pound
for
down
what
do
you
do
you
hide
and
you
watch
and
you
pounce
upon
that
knowing
what
she
subject
to
and
what
a
little
thing
will
bring
on
in
that
surprising
manner
and
with
that
severity
that
by
the
lord
she
goes
off
and
keeps
off
when
a
life
may
be
hanging
upon
that
girl
words
he
so
thoroughly
meant
what
he
said
now
that
i
involuntarily
clasped
my
hands
and
felt
the
room
turning
away
from
me
but
it
stopped
woodcourt
came
in
put
a
paper
into
his
hand
and
went
away
again
now
snagsby
the
only
amends
you
can
make
said
bucket
rapidly
glancing
at
it
is
to
let
me
speak
a
word
to
this
young
lady
in
private
here
and
if
you
know
of
any
help
that
you
can
give
to
that
gentleman
in
the
next
kitchen
there
or
can
think
of
any
one
thing
that
likelier
than
another
to
bring
the
girl
round
do
your
swiftest
and
best
in
an
instant
she
was
gone
and
he
had
shut
the
door
now
my
dear
you
steady
and
quite
sure
of
yourself
quite
said
i
whose
writing
is
that
it
was
my
mother
a
on
a
crushed
and
torn
piece
of
paper
blotted
with
wet
folded
roughly
like
a
letter
and
directed
to
me
at
my
guardian
you
know
the
hand
he
said
and
if
you
are
firm
enough
to
read
it
to
me
do
but
be
particular
to
a
word
it
had
been
written
in
portions
at
different
times
i
read
what
follows
i
came
to
the
cottage
with
two
objects
first
to
see
the
dear
one
if
i
could
once
more
but
only
to
see
her
not
to
speak
to
her
or
let
her
know
that
i
was
near
the
other
object
to
elude
pursuit
and
to
be
lost
do
not
blame
the
mother
for
her
share
the
assistance
that
she
rendered
me
she
rendered
on
my
strongest
assurance
that
it
was
for
the
dear
one
good
you
remember
her
dead
child
the
consent
i
bought
but
her
help
was
freely
given
came
that
was
written
said
my
companion
when
she
rested
there
it
bears
out
what
i
made
of
it
i
was
right
the
next
was
written
at
another
time
i
have
wandered
a
long
distance
and
for
many
hours
and
i
know
that
i
must
soon
die
these
streets
i
have
no
purpose
but
to
die
when
i
left
i
had
a
worse
but
i
am
saved
from
adding
that
guilt
to
the
rest
cold
wet
and
fatigue
are
sufficient
causes
for
my
being
found
dead
but
i
shall
die
of
others
though
i
suffer
from
these
it
was
right
that
all
that
had
sustained
me
should
give
way
at
once
and
that
i
should
die
of
terror
and
my
conscience
take
courage
said
bucket
there
only
a
few
words
more
those
too
were
written
at
another
time
to
all
appearance
almost
in
the
dark
i
have
done
all
i
could
do
to
be
lost
i
shall
be
soon
forgotten
so
and
shall
disgrace
him
least
i
have
nothing
about
me
by
which
i
can
be
recognized
this
paper
i
part
with
now
the
place
where
i
shall
lie
down
if
i
can
get
so
far
has
been
often
in
my
mind
farewell
forgive
bucket
supporting
me
with
his
arm
lowered
me
gently
into
my
chair
cheer
up
do
think
me
hard
with
you
my
dear
but
as
soon
as
ever
you
feel
equal
to
it
get
your
shoes
on
and
be
ready
i
did
as
he
required
but
i
was
left
there
a
long
time
praying
for
my
unhappy
mother
they
were
all
occupied
with
the
poor
girl
and
i
heard
woodcourt
directing
them
and
speaking
to
her
often
at
length
he
came
in
with
bucket
and
said
that
as
it
was
important
to
address
her
gently
he
thought
it
best
that
i
should
ask
her
for
whatever
information
we
desired
to
obtain
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
could
now
reply
to
questions
if
she
were
soothed
and
not
alarmed
the
questions
bucket
said
were
how
she
came
by
the
letter
what
passed
between
her
and
the
person
who
gave
her
the
letter
and
where
the
person
went
holding
my
mind
as
steadily
as
i
could
to
these
points
i
went
into
the
next
room
with
them
woodcourt
would
have
remained
outside
but
at
my
solicitation
went
in
with
us
the
poor
girl
was
sitting
on
the
floor
where
they
had
laid
her
down
they
stood
around
her
though
at
a
little
distance
that
she
might
have
air
she
was
not
pretty
and
looked
weak
and
poor
but
she
had
a
plaintive
and
a
good
face
though
it
was
still
a
little
wild
i
kneeled
on
the
ground
beside
her
and
put
her
poor
head
upon
my
shoulder
whereupon
she
drew
her
arm
round
my
neck
and
burst
into
tears
my
poor
girl
said
i
laying
my
face
against
her
forehead
for
indeed
i
was
crying
too
and
trembling
it
seems
cruel
to
trouble
you
now
but
more
depends
on
our
knowing
something
about
this
letter
than
i
could
tell
you
in
an
hour
she
began
piteously
declaring
that
she
did
mean
any
harm
she
did
mean
any
harm
snagsby
we
are
all
sure
of
that
said
i
but
pray
tell
me
how
you
got
it
yes
dear
lady
i
will
and
tell
you
true
i
tell
true
indeed
mrs
snagsby
i
am
sure
of
that
said
i
and
how
was
it
i
had
been
out
on
an
errand
dear
lady
long
after
it
was
dark
quite
late
and
when
i
came
home
i
found
a
person
all
wet
and
muddy
looking
up
at
our
house
when
she
saw
me
coming
in
at
the
door
she
called
me
back
and
said
did
i
live
here
and
i
said
yes
and
she
said
she
knew
only
one
or
two
places
about
here
but
had
lost
her
way
and
could
find
them
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
they
wo
believe
me
she
did
say
any
harm
to
me
and
i
did
say
any
harm
to
her
indeed
mrs
snagsby
it
was
necessary
for
her
mistress
to
comfort
her
which
she
did
i
must
say
with
a
good
deal
of
contrition
before
she
could
be
got
beyond
this
she
could
not
find
those
places
said
i
no
cried
the
girl
shaking
her
head
no
could
find
them
and
she
was
so
faint
and
lame
and
miserable
oh
so
wretched
that
if
you
had
seen
her
snagsby
you
have
given
her
half
a
crown
i
know
well
guster
my
girl
said
he
at
first
not
knowing
what
to
say
i
hope
i
should
and
yet
she
was
so
well
spoken
said
the
girl
looking
at
me
with
wide
open
eyes
that
it
made
a
person
heart
bleed
and
so
she
said
to
me
did
i
know
the
way
to
the
burying
ground
and
i
asked
her
which
burying
ground
and
she
said
the
poor
burying
ground
and
so
i
told
her
i
had
been
a
poor
child
myself
and
it
was
according
to
parishes
but
she
said
she
meant
a
poor
burying
ground
not
very
far
from
here
where
there
was
an
archway
and
a
step
and
an
iron
gate
as
i
watched
her
face
and
soothed
her
to
go
on
i
saw
that
bucket
received
this
with
a
look
which
i
could
not
separate
from
one
of
alarm
oh
dear
dear
cried
the
girl
pressing
her
hair
back
with
her
hands
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
she
meant
the
burying
ground
where
the
man
was
buried
that
took
the
that
you
came
home
and
told
us
of
snagsby
that
frightened
me
so
snagsby
oh
i
am
frightened
again
hold
me
you
are
so
much
better
now
sald
i
pray
pray
tell
me
more
yes
i
will
yes
i
will
but
do
be
angry
with
me
that
a
dear
lady
because
i
have
been
so
angry
with
her
poor
soul
there
now
i
will
now
i
will
so
she
said
could
i
tell
her
how
to
find
it
and
i
said
yes
and
i
told
her
and
she
looked
at
me
with
eyes
like
almost
as
if
she
was
blind
and
herself
all
waving
back
and
so
she
took
out
the
letter
and
showed
it
me
and
said
if
she
was
to
put
that
in
the
it
would
be
rubbed
out
and
not
minded
and
never
sent
and
would
i
take
it
from
her
and
send
it
and
the
messenger
would
be
paid
at
the
house
and
so
i
said
yes
if
it
was
no
harm
and
she
said
no
no
harm
and
so
i
took
it
from
her
and
she
said
she
had
nothing
to
give
me
and
i
said
i
was
poor
myself
and
consequently
wanted
nothing
and
so
she
said
god
bless
you
and
went
and
did
she
go
yes
cried
the
girl
anticipating
the
inquiry
yes
she
went
the
way
i
had
shown
her
then
i
came
in
and
snagsby
came
behind
me
from
somewhere
and
laid
hold
of
me
and
i
was
frightened
woodcourt
took
her
kindly
from
me
bucket
wrapped
me
up
and
immediately
we
were
in
the
street
woodcourt
hesitated
but
i
said
do
leave
me
now
and
bucket
added
you
be
better
with
us
we
may
want
you
do
lose
time
i
have
the
most
confused
impressions
of
that
walk
i
recollect
that
it
was
neither
night
nor
day
that
morning
was
dawning
but
the
were
not
yet
put
out
that
the
sleet
was
still
falling
and
that
all
the
ways
were
deep
with
it
i
recollect
a
few
chilled
people
passing
in
the
streets
i
recollect
the
wet
the
clogged
and
bursting
gutters
and
the
mounds
of
blackened
ice
and
snow
over
which
we
passed
the
narrowness
of
the
courts
by
which
we
went
at
the
same
time
i
remember
that
the
poor
girl
seemed
to
be
yet
telling
her
story
audibly
and
plainly
in
my
hearing
that
i
could
feel
her
resting
on
my
arm
that
the
stained
put
on
human
shapes
and
looked
at
me
that
great
seemed
to
be
opening
and
closing
in
my
head
or
in
the
air
and
that
the
unreal
things
were
more
substantial
than
the
real
at
last
we
stood
under
a
dark
and
miserable
covered
way
where
one
lamp
was
burning
over
an
iron
gate
and
where
the
morning
faintly
struggled
in
the
gate
was
closed
beyond
it
was
a
burial
ground
a
dreadful
spot
in
which
the
night
was
very
slowly
stirring
but
where
i
could
dimly
see
heaps
of
dishonoured
graves
and
stones
hemmed
in
by
filthy
houses
with
a
few
dull
lights
in
their
windows
and
on
whose
walls
a
thick
humidity
broke
out
like
a
disease
on
the
step
at
the
gate
drenched
in
the
fearful
wet
of
such
a
place
which
oozed
and
splashed
down
everywhere
i
saw
with
a
cry
of
pity
and
horror
a
woman
lying
jenny
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
i
ran
forward
but
they
stopped
me
and
woodcourt
entreated
me
with
the
greatest
earnestness
even
with
tears
before
i
went
up
to
the
figure
to
listen
for
an
instant
to
what
bucket
said
i
did
so
as
i
thought
i
did
so
as
i
am
sure
miss
summerson
you
understand
me
if
you
think
a
moment
they
changed
clothes
at
the
cottage
they
changed
clothes
at
the
cottage
i
could
repeat
the
words
in
my
mind
and
i
knew
what
they
meant
of
themselves
but
i
attached
no
meaning
to
them
in
any
other
connexion
and
one
returned
said
bucket
and
one
went
on
and
the
one
that
went
on
only
went
on
a
certain
way
agreed
upon
to
deceive
and
then
turned
across
country
and
went
home
think
a
moment
i
could
repeat
this
in
my
mind
too
but
i
had
not
the
least
idea
what
it
meant
i
saw
before
me
lying
on
the
step
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
she
lay
there
with
one
arm
creeping
round
a
bar
of
the
iron
gate
and
seeming
to
embrace
it
she
lay
there
who
had
so
lately
spoken
to
my
mother
she
lay
there
a
distressed
unsheltered
senseless
creature
she
who
had
brought
my
mother
letter
who
could
give
me
the
only
clue
to
where
my
mother
was
she
who
was
to
guide
us
to
rescue
and
save
her
whom
we
had
sought
so
far
who
had
come
to
this
condition
by
some
means
connected
with
my
mother
that
i
could
not
follow
and
might
be
passing
beyond
our
reach
and
help
at
that
moment
she
lay
there
and
they
stopped
me
i
saw
but
did
not
comprehend
the
solemn
and
compassionate
look
in
woodcourt
face
i
saw
but
did
not
comprehend
his
touching
the
other
on
the
breast
to
keep
him
back
i
saw
him
stand
uncovered
in
the
bitter
air
with
a
reverence
for
something
but
my
understanding
for
all
this
was
gone
i
even
heard
it
said
between
them
shall
she
go
she
had
better
go
her
hands
should
be
the
first
to
touch
her
they
have
a
higher
right
than
ours
i
passed
on
to
the
gate
and
stooped
down
i
lifted
the
heavy
head
put
the
long
dank
hair
aside
and
turned
the
face
and
it
was
my
mother
cold
and
dead
chapter
lx
perspective
i
proceed
to
other
passages
of
my
narrative
from
the
goodness
of
all
about
me
i
derived
such
consolation
as
i
can
never
think
of
unmoved
i
have
already
said
so
much
of
myself
and
so
much
still
remains
that
i
will
not
dwell
upon
my
sorrow
i
had
an
illness
but
it
was
not
a
long
one
and
i
would
avoid
even
this
mention
of
it
if
i
could
quite
keep
down
the
recollection
of
their
sympathy
i
proceed
to
other
passages
of
my
narrative
during
the
time
of
my
illness
we
were
still
in
london
where
woodcourt
had
come
on
my
guardian
invitation
to
stay
with
us
when
my
guardian
thought
me
well
and
cheerful
enough
to
talk
with
him
in
our
old
way
though
i
could
have
done
that
sooner
if
he
would
have
believed
me
i
resumed
my
work
and
my
chair
beside
his
he
had
appointed
the
time
himself
and
we
were
alone
dame
trot
said
he
receiving
me
with
a
kiss
welcome
to
the
growlery
again
my
dear
i
have
a
scheme
to
develop
little
woman
i
propose
to
remain
here
perhaps
for
six
months
perhaps
for
a
longer
time
as
it
may
be
quite
to
settle
here
for
a
while
in
short
and
in
the
meanwhile
leave
bleak
house
said
i
aye
my
dear
bleak
house
he
returned
must
learn
to
take
care
of
itself
i
thought
his
tone
sounded
sorrowful
but
looking
at
him
i
saw
his
kind
face
lighted
up
by
its
pleasantest
smile
bleak
house
he
repeated
and
his
tone
did
not
sound
sorrowful
i
found
must
learn
to
take
care
of
itself
it
is
a
long
way
from
ada
my
dear
and
ada
stands
much
in
need
of
you
it
like
you
guardian
said
i
to
have
been
taking
that
into
consideration
for
a
happy
surprise
to
both
of
us
not
so
disinterested
either
my
dear
if
you
mean
to
extol
me
for
that
virtue
since
if
you
were
generally
on
the
road
you
could
be
seldom
with
me
and
besides
i
wish
to
hear
as
much
and
as
often
of
ada
as
i
can
in
this
condition
of
estrangement
from
poor
rick
not
of
her
alone
but
of
him
too
poor
fellow
have
you
seen
woodcourt
this
morning
guardian
i
see
woodcourt
every
morning
dame
durden
does
he
still
say
the
same
of
richard
just
the
same
he
knows
of
no
direct
bodily
illness
that
he
has
on
the
contrary
he
believes
that
he
has
none
yet
he
is
not
easy
about
him
who
can
be
my
dear
girl
had
been
to
see
us
lately
every
day
some
times
twice
in
a
day
but
we
had
foreseen
all
along
that
this
would
only
last
until
i
was
quite
myself
we
knew
full
well
that
her
fervent
heart
was
as
full
of
affection
and
gratitude
towards
her
cousin
john
as
it
had
ever
been
and
we
acquitted
richard
of
laying
any
injunctions
upon
her
to
stay
away
but
we
knew
on
the
other
hand
that
she
felt
it
a
part
of
her
duty
to
him
to
be
sparing
of
her
visits
at
our
house
my
guardian
delicacy
had
soon
perceived
this
and
had
tried
to
convey
to
her
that
he
thought
she
was
right
dear
unfortunate
mistaken
richard
said
i
when
will
he
awake
from
his
delusion
he
is
not
in
the
way
to
do
so
now
my
dear
replied
my
guardian
the
more
he
suffers
the
more
averse
he
will
be
to
me
having
made
me
the
principal
representative
of
the
great
occasion
of
his
suffering
i
could
not
help
adding
so
unreasonably
ah
dame
trot
dame
trot
returned
my
guardian
what
shall
we
find
reasonable
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
unreason
and
injustice
at
the
top
unreason
and
injustice
at
the
heart
and
at
the
bottom
unreason
and
injustice
from
beginning
to
end
if
it
ever
has
an
end
how
should
poor
rick
always
hovering
near
it
pluck
reason
out
of
it
he
no
more
gathers
grapes
from
thorns
or
figs
from
thistles
than
older
men
did
in
old
times
his
gentleness
and
consideration
for
richard
whenever
we
spoke
of
him
touched
me
so
that
i
was
always
silent
on
this
subject
very
soon
i
suppose
the
lord
chancellor
and
the
vice
chancellors
and
the
whole
chancery
battery
of
great
guns
would
be
infinitely
astonished
by
such
unreason
and
injustice
in
one
of
their
suitors
pursued
my
guardian
when
those
learned
gentlemen
begin
to
raise
from
the
powder
they
sow
in
their
wigs
i
shall
begin
to
be
astonished
too
he
checked
himself
in
glancing
towards
the
window
to
look
where
the
wind
was
and
leaned
on
the
back
of
my
chair
instead
well
well
little
woman
to
go
on
my
dear
this
rock
we
must
leave
to
time
chance
and
hopeful
circumstance
we
must
not
shipwreck
ada
upon
it
she
can
not
afford
and
he
can
not
afford
the
remotest
chance
of
another
separation
from
a
friend
therefore
i
have
particularly
begged
of
woodcourt
and
i
now
particularly
beg
of
you
my
dear
not
to
move
this
subject
with
rick
let
it
rest
next
week
next
month
next
year
sooner
or
later
he
will
see
me
with
clearer
eyes
i
can
wait
but
i
had
already
discussed
it
with
him
i
confessed
and
so
i
thought
had
woodcourt
so
he
tells
me
returned
my
guardian
very
good
he
has
made
his
protest
and
dame
durden
has
made
hers
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
about
it
now
i
come
to
woodcourt
how
do
you
like
her
my
dear
in
answer
to
this
question
which
was
oddly
abrupt
i
said
i
liked
her
very
much
and
thought
she
was
more
agreeable
than
she
used
to
be
i
think
so
too
said
my
guardian
less
pedigree
not
so
much
of
morgan
ap
what
his
name
that
was
what
i
meant
i
acknowledged
though
he
was
a
very
harmless
person
even
when
we
had
had
more
of
him
still
upon
the
whole
he
is
as
well
in
his
native
mountains
said
my
guardian
i
agree
with
you
then
little
woman
can
i
do
better
for
a
time
than
retain
woodcourt
here
no
and
yet
my
guardian
looked
at
me
waiting
for
what
i
had
to
say
i
had
nothing
to
say
at
least
i
had
nothing
in
my
mind
that
i
could
say
i
had
an
undefined
impression
that
it
might
have
been
better
if
we
had
had
some
other
inmate
but
i
could
hardly
have
explained
why
even
to
myself
or
if
to
myself
certainly
not
to
anybody
else
you
see
said
my
guardian
our
neighbourhood
is
in
way
and
he
can
come
here
to
see
her
as
often
as
he
likes
which
is
agreeable
to
them
both
and
she
is
familiar
to
us
and
fond
of
you
yes
that
was
undeniable
i
had
nothing
to
say
against
it
i
could
not
have
suggested
a
better
arrangement
but
i
was
not
quite
easy
in
my
mind
esther
esther
why
not
esther
think
it
is
a
very
good
plan
indeed
dear
guardian
and
we
could
not
do
better
sure
little
woman
quite
sure
i
had
had
a
moment
time
to
think
since
i
had
urged
that
duty
on
myself
and
i
was
quite
sure
good
said
my
guardian
it
shall
be
done
carried
unanimously
carried
unanimously
i
repeated
going
on
with
my
work
it
was
a
cover
for
his
that
i
happened
to
be
ornamenting
it
had
been
laid
by
on
the
night
preceding
my
sad
journey
and
never
resumed
i
showed
it
to
him
now
and
he
admired
it
highly
after
i
had
explained
the
pattern
to
him
and
all
the
great
effects
that
were
to
come
out
by
and
by
i
thought
i
would
go
back
to
our
last
theme
you
said
dear
guardian
when
we
spoke
of
woodcourt
before
ada
left
us
that
you
thought
he
would
give
a
long
trial
to
another
country
have
you
been
advising
him
since
yes
little
woman
pretty
often
has
he
decided
to
do
so
i
rather
think
not
some
other
prospect
has
opened
to
him
perhaps
said
i
why
yes
perhaps
returned
my
guardian
beginning
his
answer
in
a
very
deliberate
manner
about
half
a
year
hence
or
so
there
is
a
medical
attendant
for
the
poor
to
be
appointed
at
a
certain
place
in
yorkshire
it
is
a
thriving
place
pleasantly
situated
streams
and
streets
town
and
country
mill
and
moor
and
seems
to
present
an
opening
for
such
a
man
i
mean
a
man
whose
hopes
and
aims
may
sometimes
lie
as
most
men
sometimes
do
i
dare
say
above
the
ordinary
level
but
to
whom
the
ordinary
level
will
be
high
enough
after
all
if
it
should
prove
to
be
a
way
of
usefulness
and
good
service
leading
to
no
other
all
generous
spirits
are
ambitious
i
suppose
but
the
ambition
that
calmly
trusts
itself
to
such
a
road
instead
of
spasmodically
trying
to
fly
over
it
is
of
the
kind
i
care
for
it
is
woodcourt
kind
and
will
he
get
this
appointment
i
asked
why
little
woman
returned
my
guardian
smiling
not
being
an
oracle
i
can
not
confidently
say
but
i
think
so
his
reputation
stands
very
high
there
were
people
from
that
part
of
the
country
in
the
shipwreck
and
strange
to
say
i
believe
the
best
man
has
the
best
chance
you
must
not
suppose
it
to
be
a
fine
endowment
it
is
a
very
very
commonplace
affair
my
dear
an
appointment
to
a
great
amount
of
work
and
a
small
amount
of
pay
but
better
things
will
gather
about
it
it
may
be
fairly
hoped
the
poor
of
that
place
will
have
reason
to
bless
the
choice
if
it
falls
on
woodcourt
guardian
you
are
right
little
woman
that
i
am
sure
they
will
we
said
no
more
about
it
nor
did
he
say
a
word
about
the
future
of
bleak
house
but
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
taken
my
seat
at
his
side
in
my
mourning
dress
and
that
accounted
for
it
i
considered
i
now
began
to
visit
my
dear
girl
every
day
in
the
dull
dark
corner
where
she
lived
the
morning
was
my
usual
time
but
whenever
i
found
i
had
an
hour
or
so
to
spare
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
bustled
off
to
chancery
lane
they
were
both
so
glad
to
see
me
at
all
hours
and
used
to
brighten
up
so
when
they
heard
me
opening
the
door
and
coming
in
being
quite
at
home
i
never
knocked
that
i
had
no
fear
of
becoming
troublesome
just
yet
on
these
occasions
i
frequently
found
richard
absent
at
other
times
he
would
be
writing
or
reading
papers
in
the
cause
at
that
table
of
his
so
covered
with
papers
which
was
never
disturbed
sometimes
i
would
come
upon
him
lingering
at
the
door
of
vholes
office
sometimes
i
would
meet
him
in
the
neighbourhood
lounging
about
and
biting
his
nails
i
often
met
him
wandering
in
lincoln
inn
near
the
place
where
i
had
first
seen
him
oh
how
different
how
different
that
the
money
ada
brought
him
was
melting
away
with
the
candles
i
used
to
see
burning
after
dark
in
vholes
office
i
knew
very
well
it
was
not
a
large
amount
in
the
beginning
he
had
married
in
debt
and
i
could
not
fail
to
understand
by
this
time
what
was
meant
by
vholes
shoulder
being
at
the
wheel
as
i
still
heard
it
was
my
dear
made
the
best
of
housekeepers
and
tried
hard
to
save
but
i
knew
that
they
were
getting
poorer
and
poorer
every
day
she
shone
in
the
miserable
corner
like
a
beautiful
star
she
adorned
and
graced
it
so
that
it
became
another
place
paler
than
she
had
been
at
home
and
a
little
quieter
than
i
had
thought
natural
when
she
was
yet
so
cheerful
and
hopeful
her
face
was
so
unshadowed
that
i
half
believed
she
was
blinded
by
her
love
for
richard
to
his
ruinous
career
i
went
one
day
to
dine
with
them
while
i
was
under
this
impression
as
i
turned
into
symond
inn
i
met
little
miss
flite
coming
out
she
had
been
to
make
a
stately
call
upon
the
wards
in
jarndyce
as
she
still
called
them
and
had
derived
the
highest
gratification
from
that
ceremony
ada
had
already
told
me
that
she
called
every
monday
at
five
with
one
little
extra
white
bow
in
her
bonnet
which
never
appeared
there
at
any
other
time
and
with
her
largest
reticule
of
documents
on
her
arm
my
dear
she
began
so
delighted
how
do
you
do
so
glad
to
see
you
and
you
are
going
to
visit
our
interesting
jarndyce
wards
to
be
sure
our
beauty
is
at
home
my
dear
and
will
be
charmed
to
see
you
then
richard
is
not
come
in
yet
said
i
i
am
glad
of
that
for
i
was
afraid
of
being
a
little
late
no
he
is
not
come
in
returned
miss
flite
he
has
had
a
long
day
in
court
i
left
him
there
with
vholes
you
do
like
vholes
i
hope
do
like
vholes
man
i
am
afraid
you
see
richard
oftener
than
ever
now
said
i
my
dearest
returned
miss
flite
daily
and
hourly
you
know
what
i
told
you
of
the
attraction
on
the
chancellor
table
my
dear
next
to
myself
he
is
the
most
constant
suitor
in
court
he
begins
quite
to
amuse
our
little
party
friendly
little
party
are
we
not
it
was
miserable
to
hear
this
from
her
poor
mad
lips
though
it
was
no
surprise
in
short
my
valued
friend
pursued
miss
flite
advancing
her
lips
to
my
ear
with
an
air
of
equal
patronage
and
mystery
i
must
tell
you
a
secret
i
have
made
him
my
executor
nominated
constituted
and
appointed
him
in
my
will
indeed
said
i
repeated
miss
flite
in
her
most
genteel
accents
my
executor
administrator
and
assign
our
chancery
phrases
my
love
i
have
reflected
that
if
i
should
wear
out
he
will
be
able
to
watch
that
judgment
being
so
very
regular
in
his
attendance
it
made
me
sigh
to
think
of
him
i
did
at
one
time
mean
said
miss
flite
echoing
the
sigh
to
nominate
constitute
and
appoint
poor
gridley
also
very
regular
my
charming
girl
i
assure
you
most
exemplary
but
he
wore
out
poor
man
so
i
have
appointed
his
successor
do
mention
it
this
is
in
confidence
she
carefully
opened
her
reticule
a
little
way
and
showed
me
a
folded
piece
of
paper
inside
as
the
appointment
of
which
she
spoke
another
secret
my
dear
i
have
added
to
my
collection
of
birds
really
miss
flite
said
i
knowing
how
it
pleased
her
to
have
her
confidence
received
with
an
appearance
of
interest
she
nodded
several
times
and
her
face
became
overcast
and
gloomy
two
more
i
call
them
the
wards
in
jarndyce
they
are
caged
up
with
all
the
others
with
hope
joy
youth
peace
rest
life
dust
ashes
waste
want
ruin
despair
madness
death
cunning
folly
words
wigs
rags
sheepskin
plunder
precedent
jargon
gammon
and
spinach
the
poor
soul
kissed
me
with
the
most
troubled
look
i
had
ever
seen
in
her
and
went
her
way
her
manner
of
running
over
the
names
of
her
birds
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
hearing
them
even
from
her
own
lips
quite
chilled
me
this
was
not
a
cheering
preparation
for
my
visit
and
i
could
have
dispensed
with
the
company
of
vholes
when
richard
who
arrived
within
a
minute
or
two
after
me
brought
him
to
share
our
dinner
although
it
was
a
very
plain
one
ada
and
richard
were
for
some
minutes
both
out
of
the
room
together
helping
to
get
ready
what
we
were
to
eat
and
drink
vholes
took
that
opportunity
of
holding
a
little
conversation
in
a
low
voice
with
me
he
came
to
the
window
where
i
was
sitting
and
began
upon
symond
inn
a
dull
place
miss
summerson
for
a
life
that
is
not
an
official
one
said
vholes
smearing
the
glass
with
his
black
glove
to
make
it
clearer
for
me
there
is
not
much
to
see
here
said
i
nor
to
hear
miss
returned
vholes
a
little
music
does
occasionally
stray
in
but
we
are
not
musical
in
the
law
and
soon
eject
it
i
hope
jarndyce
is
as
well
as
his
friends
could
wish
him
i
thanked
vholes
and
said
he
was
quite
well
i
have
not
the
pleasure
to
be
admitted
among
the
number
of
his
friends
myself
said
vholes
and
i
am
aware
that
the
gentlemen
of
our
profession
are
sometimes
regarded
in
such
quarters
with
an
unfavourable
eye
our
plain
course
however
under
good
report
and
evil
report
and
all
kinds
of
prejudice
we
are
the
victims
of
prejudice
is
to
have
everything
openly
carried
on
how
do
you
find
looking
miss
summerson
he
looks
very
dreadfully
anxious
just
so
said
vholes
he
stood
behind
me
with
his
long
black
figure
reaching
nearly
to
the
ceiling
of
those
low
rooms
feeling
the
pimples
on
his
face
as
if
they
were
ornaments
and
speaking
inwardly
and
evenly
as
though
there
were
not
a
human
passion
or
emotion
in
his
nature
woodcourt
is
in
attendance
upon
i
believe
he
resumed
woodcourt
is
his
disinterested
friend
i
answered
but
i
mean
in
professional
attendance
medical
attendance
that
can
do
little
for
an
unhappy
mind
said
i
just
so
said
vholes
so
slow
so
eager
so
bloodless
and
gaunt
i
felt
as
if
richard
were
wasting
away
beneath
the
eyes
of
this
adviser
and
there
were
something
of
the
vampire
in
him
miss
summerson
said
vholes
very
slowly
rubbing
his
gloved
hands
as
if
to
his
cold
sense
of
touch
they
were
much
the
same
in
black
kid
or
out
of
it
this
was
an
marriage
of
mr
i
begged
he
would
excuse
me
from
discussing
it
they
had
been
engaged
when
they
were
both
very
young
i
told
him
a
little
indignantly
and
when
the
prospect
before
them
was
much
fairer
and
brighter
when
richard
had
not
yielded
himself
to
the
unhappy
influence
which
now
darkened
his
life
just
so
assented
vholes
again
still
with
a
view
to
everything
being
openly
carried
on
i
will
with
your
permission
miss
summerson
observe
to
you
that
i
consider
this
a
very
marriage
indeed
i
owe
the
opinion
not
only
to
connexions
against
whom
i
should
naturally
wish
to
protect
myself
but
also
to
my
own
reputation
dear
to
myself
as
a
professional
man
aiming
to
keep
respectable
dear
to
my
three
girls
at
home
for
whom
i
am
striving
to
realize
some
little
independence
dear
i
will
even
say
to
my
aged
father
whom
it
is
my
privilege
to
support
it
would
become
a
very
different
marriage
a
much
happier
and
better
marriage
another
marriage
altogether
vholes
said
i
if
richard
were
persuaded
to
turn
his
back
on
the
fatal
pursuit
in
which
you
are
engaged
with
him
vholes
with
a
noiseless
cough
or
rather
gasp
into
one
of
his
black
gloves
inclined
his
head
as
if
he
did
not
wholly
dispute
even
that
miss
summerson
he
said
it
may
be
so
and
i
freely
admit
that
the
young
lady
who
has
taken
name
upon
herself
in
so
a
manner
you
will
i
am
sure
not
quarrel
with
me
for
throwing
out
that
remark
again
as
a
duty
i
owe
to
connexions
is
a
highly
genteel
young
lady
business
has
prevented
me
from
mixing
much
with
general
society
in
any
but
a
professional
character
still
i
trust
i
am
competent
to
perceive
that
she
is
a
highly
genteel
young
lady
as
to
beauty
i
am
not
a
judge
of
that
myself
and
i
never
did
give
much
attention
to
it
from
a
boy
but
i
dare
say
the
young
lady
is
equally
eligible
in
that
point
of
view
she
is
considered
so
i
have
heard
among
the
clerks
in
the
inn
and
it
is
a
point
more
in
their
way
than
in
mine
in
reference
to
pursuit
of
his
interests
oh
his
interests
mr
vholes
pardon
me
returned
vholes
going
on
in
exactly
the
same
inward
and
dispassionate
manner
takes
certain
interests
under
certain
wills
disputed
in
the
suit
it
is
a
term
we
use
in
reference
to
c
pursuit
of
his
interests
i
mentioned
to
you
miss
summerson
the
first
time
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
in
my
desire
that
everything
should
be
openly
carried
on
i
used
those
words
for
i
happened
afterwards
to
note
them
in
my
diary
which
is
producible
at
any
time
i
mentioned
to
you
that
had
laid
down
the
principle
of
watching
his
own
interests
and
that
when
a
client
of
mine
laid
down
a
principle
which
was
not
of
an
immoral
that
is
to
say
unlawful
nature
it
devolved
upon
me
to
carry
it
out
i
have
carried
it
out
i
do
carry
it
out
but
i
will
not
smooth
things
over
to
any
connexion
of
on
any
account
as
open
as
i
was
to
jarndyce
i
am
to
you
i
regard
it
in
the
light
of
a
professional
duty
to
be
so
though
it
can
be
charged
to
no
one
i
openly
say
unpalatable
as
it
may
be
that
i
consider
affairs
in
a
very
bad
way
that
i
consider
himself
in
a
very
bad
way
and
that
i
regard
this
as
an
exceedingly
marriage
am
i
here
sir
yes
i
thank
you
i
am
here
and
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
some
agreeable
conversation
with
miss
summerson
for
which
i
have
to
thank
you
very
much
sir
he
broke
off
thus
in
answer
to
richard
who
addressed
him
as
he
came
into
the
room
by
this
time
i
too
well
understood
scrupulous
way
of
saving
himself
and
his
respectability
not
to
feel
that
our
worst
fears
did
but
keep
pace
with
his
client
progress
we
sat
down
to
dinner
and
i
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
richard
anxiously
i
was
not
disturbed
by
vholes
who
took
off
his
gloves
to
dine
though
he
sat
opposite
to
me
at
the
small
table
for
i
doubt
if
looking
up
at
all
he
once
removed
his
eyes
from
his
face
i
found
richard
thin
and
languid
slovenly
in
his
dress
abstracted
in
his
manner
forcing
his
spirits
now
and
then
and
at
other
intervals
relapsing
into
a
dull
thoughtfulness
about
his
large
bright
eyes
that
used
to
be
so
merry
there
was
a
wanness
and
a
restlessness
that
changed
them
altogether
i
can
not
use
the
expression
that
he
looked
old
there
is
a
ruin
of
youth
which
is
not
like
age
and
into
such
a
ruin
richard
youth
and
youthful
beauty
had
all
fallen
away
he
ate
little
and
seemed
indifferent
what
it
was
showed
himself
to
be
much
more
impatient
than
he
used
to
be
and
was
quick
even
with
ada
i
thought
at
first
that
his
old
manner
was
all
gone
but
it
shone
out
of
him
sometimes
as
i
had
occasionally
known
little
momentary
glimpses
of
my
own
old
face
to
look
out
upon
me
from
the
glass
his
laugh
had
not
quite
left
him
either
but
it
was
like
the
echo
of
a
joyful
sound
and
that
is
always
sorrowful
yet
he
was
as
glad
as
ever
in
his
old
affectionate
way
to
have
me
there
and
we
talked
of
the
old
times
pleasantly
these
did
not
appear
to
be
interesting
to
vholes
though
he
occasionally
made
a
gasp
which
i
believe
was
his
smile
he
rose
shortly
after
dinner
and
said
that
with
the
permission
of
the
ladies
he
would
retire
to
his
office
always
devoted
to
business
vholes
cried
richard
yes
he
returned
the
interests
of
clients
are
never
to
be
neglected
sir
they
are
paramount
in
the
thoughts
of
a
professional
man
like
myself
who
wishes
to
preserve
a
good
name
among
his
and
society
at
large
my
denying
myself
the
pleasure
of
the
present
agreeable
conversation
may
not
be
wholly
irrespective
of
your
own
interests
richard
expressed
himself
quite
sure
of
that
and
lighted
vholes
out
on
his
return
he
told
us
more
than
once
that
vholes
was
a
good
fellow
a
safe
fellow
a
man
who
did
what
he
pretended
to
do
a
very
good
fellow
indeed
he
was
so
defiant
about
it
that
it
struck
me
he
had
begun
to
doubt
vholes
then
he
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
tired
out
and
ada
and
i
put
things
to
rights
for
they
had
no
other
servant
than
the
woman
who
attended
to
the
chambers
my
dear
girl
had
a
cottage
piano
there
and
quietly
sat
down
to
sing
some
of
richard
favourites
the
lamp
being
first
removed
into
the
next
room
as
he
complained
of
its
hurting
his
eyes
i
sat
between
them
at
my
dear
girl
side
and
felt
very
melancholy
listening
to
her
sweet
voice
i
think
richard
did
too
i
think
he
darkened
the
room
for
that
reason
she
had
been
singing
some
time
rising
between
whiles
to
bend
over
him
and
speak
to
him
when
woodcourt
came
in
then
he
sat
down
by
richard
and
half
playfully
half
earnestly
quite
naturally
and
easily
found
out
how
he
felt
and
where
he
had
been
all
day
presently
he
proposed
to
accompany
him
in
a
short
walk
on
one
of
the
bridges
as
it
was
a
moonlight
airy
night
and
richard
readily
consenting
they
went
out
together
they
left
my
dear
girl
still
sitting
at
the
piano
and
me
still
sitting
beside
her
when
they
were
gone
out
i
drew
my
arm
round
her
waist
she
put
her
left
hand
in
mine
i
was
sitting
on
that
side
but
kept
her
right
upon
the
keys
going
over
and
over
them
without
striking
any
note
esther
my
dearest
she
said
breaking
silence
richard
is
never
so
well
and
i
am
never
so
easy
about
him
as
when
he
is
with
allan
woodcourt
we
have
to
thank
you
for
that
i
pointed
out
to
my
darling
how
this
could
scarcely
be
because
woodcourt
had
come
to
her
cousin
john
house
and
had
known
us
all
there
and
because
he
had
always
liked
richard
and
richard
had
always
liked
him
and
and
so
forth
all
true
said
ada
but
that
he
is
such
a
devoted
friend
to
us
we
owe
to
you
i
thought
it
best
to
let
my
dear
girl
have
her
way
and
to
say
no
more
about
it
so
i
said
as
much
i
said
it
lightly
because
i
felt
her
trembling
esther
my
dearest
i
want
to
be
a
good
wife
a
very
very
good
wife
indeed
you
shall
teach
me
i
teach
i
said
no
more
for
i
noticed
the
hand
that
was
fluttering
over
the
keys
and
i
knew
that
it
was
not
i
who
ought
to
speak
that
it
was
she
who
had
something
to
say
to
me
when
i
married
richard
i
was
not
insensible
to
what
was
before
him
i
had
been
perfectly
happy
for
a
long
time
with
you
and
i
had
never
known
any
trouble
or
anxiety
so
loved
and
cared
for
but
i
understood
the
danger
he
was
in
dear
esther
i
know
i
know
my
darling
when
we
were
married
i
had
some
little
hope
that
i
might
be
able
to
convince
him
of
his
mistake
that
he
might
come
to
regard
it
in
a
new
way
as
my
husband
and
not
pursue
it
all
the
more
desperately
for
my
sake
as
he
does
but
if
i
had
not
had
that
hope
i
would
have
married
him
just
the
same
esther
just
the
same
in
the
momentary
firmness
of
the
hand
that
was
never
still
a
firmness
inspired
by
the
utterance
of
these
last
words
and
dying
away
with
them
i
saw
the
confirmation
of
her
earnest
tones
you
are
not
to
think
my
dearest
esther
that
i
fail
to
see
what
you
see
and
fear
what
you
fear
no
one
can
understand
him
better
than
i
do
the
greatest
wisdom
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
could
scarcely
know
richard
better
than
my
love
does
she
spoke
so
modestly
and
softly
and
her
trembling
hand
expressed
such
agitation
as
it
moved
to
and
fro
upon
the
silent
notes
my
dear
dear
girl
i
see
him
at
his
worst
every
day
i
watch
him
in
his
sleep
i
know
every
change
of
his
face
but
when
i
married
richard
i
was
quite
determined
esther
if
heaven
would
help
me
never
to
show
him
that
i
grieved
for
what
he
did
and
so
to
make
him
more
unhappy
i
want
him
when
he
comes
home
to
find
no
trouble
in
my
face
i
want
him
when
he
looks
at
me
to
see
what
he
loved
in
me
i
married
him
to
do
this
and
this
supports
me
i
felt
her
trembling
more
i
waited
for
what
was
yet
to
come
and
i
now
thought
i
began
to
know
what
it
was
and
something
else
supports
me
esther
she
stopped
a
minute
stopped
speaking
only
her
hand
was
still
in
motion
i
look
forward
a
little
while
and
i
do
know
what
great
aid
may
come
to
me
when
richard
turns
his
eyes
upon
me
then
there
may
be
something
lying
on
my
breast
more
eloquent
than
i
have
been
with
greater
power
than
mine
to
show
him
his
true
course
and
win
him
back
her
hand
stopped
now
she
clasped
me
in
her
arms
and
i
clasped
her
in
mine
if
that
little
creature
should
fail
too
esther
i
still
look
forward
i
look
forward
a
long
while
through
years
and
years
and
think
that
then
when
i
am
growing
old
or
when
i
am
dead
perhaps
a
beautiful
woman
his
daughter
happily
married
may
be
proud
of
him
and
a
blessing
to
him
or
that
a
generous
brave
man
as
handsome
as
he
used
to
be
as
hopeful
and
far
more
happy
may
walk
in
the
sunshine
with
him
honouring
his
grey
head
and
saying
to
himself
thank
god
this
is
my
father
ruined
by
a
fatal
inheritance
and
restored
through
me
oh
my
sweet
girl
what
a
heart
was
that
which
beat
so
fast
against
me
these
hopes
uphold
me
my
dear
esther
and
i
know
they
will
though
sometimes
even
they
depart
from
me
before
a
dread
that
arises
when
i
look
at
richard
i
tried
to
cheer
my
darling
and
asked
her
what
it
was
sobbing
and
weeping
she
replied
that
he
may
not
live
to
see
his
child
chapter
lxi
a
discovery
the
days
when
i
frequented
that
miserable
corner
which
my
dear
girl
brightened
can
never
fade
in
my
remembrance
i
never
see
it
and
i
never
wish
to
see
it
now
i
have
been
there
only
once
since
but
in
my
memory
there
is
a
mournful
glory
shining
on
the
place
which
will
shine
for
ever
not
a
day
passed
without
my
going
there
of
course
at
first
i
found
skimpole
there
on
two
or
three
occasions
idly
playing
the
piano
and
talking
in
his
usual
vivacious
strain
now
besides
my
very
much
mistrusting
the
probability
of
his
being
there
without
making
richard
poorer
i
felt
as
if
there
were
something
in
his
careless
gaiety
too
inconsistent
with
what
i
knew
of
the
depths
of
ada
life
i
clearly
perceived
too
that
ada
shared
my
feelings
i
therefore
resolved
after
much
thinking
of
it
to
make
a
private
visit
to
skimpole
and
try
delicately
to
explain
myself
my
dear
girl
was
the
great
consideration
that
made
me
bold
i
set
off
one
morning
accompanied
by
charley
for
somers
town
as
i
approached
the
house
i
was
strongly
inclined
to
turn
back
for
i
felt
what
a
desperate
attempt
it
was
to
make
an
impression
on
skimpole
and
how
extremely
likely
it
was
that
he
would
signally
defeat
me
however
i
thought
that
being
there
i
would
go
through
with
it
i
knocked
with
a
trembling
hand
at
door
literally
with
a
hand
for
the
knocker
was
gone
and
after
a
long
parley
gained
admission
from
an
irishwoman
who
was
in
the
area
when
i
knocked
breaking
up
the
lid
of
a
with
a
poker
to
light
the
fire
with
skimpole
lying
on
the
sofa
in
his
room
playing
the
flute
a
little
was
enchanted
to
see
me
now
who
should
receive
me
he
asked
who
would
i
prefer
for
mistress
of
the
ceremonies
would
i
have
his
comedy
daughter
his
beauty
daughter
or
his
sentiment
daughter
or
would
i
have
all
the
daughters
at
once
in
a
perfect
nosegay
i
replied
half
defeated
already
that
i
wished
to
speak
to
himself
only
if
he
would
give
me
leave
my
dear
miss
summerson
most
joyfully
of
course
he
said
bringing
his
chair
nearer
mine
and
breaking
into
his
fascinating
smile
of
course
it
not
business
then
it
pleasure
i
said
it
certainly
was
not
business
that
i
came
upon
but
it
was
not
quite
a
pleasant
matter
then
my
dear
miss
summerson
said
he
with
the
frankest
gaiety
do
allude
to
it
why
should
you
allude
to
anything
that
is
not
a
pleasant
matter
i
never
do
and
you
are
a
much
pleasanter
creature
in
every
point
of
view
than
i
you
are
perfectly
pleasant
i
am
imperfectly
pleasant
then
if
i
never
allude
to
an
unpleasant
matter
how
much
less
should
you
so
that
disposed
of
and
we
will
talk
of
something
else
although
i
was
embarrassed
i
took
courage
to
intimate
that
i
still
wished
to
pursue
the
subject
i
should
think
it
a
mistake
said
skimpole
with
his
airy
laugh
if
i
thought
miss
summerson
capable
of
making
one
but
i
do
skimpole
said
i
raising
my
eyes
to
his
i
have
so
often
heard
you
say
that
you
are
unacquainted
with
the
common
affairs
of
life
meaning
our
three
friends
l
s
and
who
the
junior
partner
d
said
skimpole
brightly
not
an
idea
of
them
that
perhaps
i
went
on
you
will
excuse
my
boldness
on
that
account
i
think
you
ought
most
seriously
to
know
that
richard
is
poorer
than
he
was
dear
me
said
skimpole
so
am
i
they
tell
me
and
in
very
embarrassed
circumstances
parallel
case
exactly
said
skimpole
with
a
delighted
countenance
this
at
present
naturally
causes
ada
much
secret
anxiety
and
as
i
think
she
is
less
anxious
when
no
claims
are
made
upon
her
by
visitors
and
as
richard
has
one
uneasiness
always
heavy
on
his
mind
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
saying
that
if
you
would
not
i
was
coming
to
the
point
with
great
difficulty
when
he
took
me
by
both
hands
and
with
a
radiant
face
and
in
the
liveliest
way
anticipated
it
not
go
there
certainly
not
my
dear
miss
summerson
most
assuredly
not
why
should
i
go
there
when
i
go
anywhere
i
go
for
pleasure
i
do
go
anywhere
for
pain
because
i
was
made
for
pleasure
pain
comes
to
me
when
it
wants
me
now
i
have
had
very
little
pleasure
at
our
dear
richard
lately
and
your
practical
sagacity
demonstrates
why
our
young
friends
losing
the
youthful
poetry
which
was
once
so
captivating
in
them
begin
to
think
is
a
man
who
wants
pounds
so
i
am
i
always
want
pounds
not
for
myself
but
because
tradespeople
always
want
them
of
me
next
our
young
friends
begin
to
think
becoming
mercenary
is
the
man
who
had
pounds
who
borrowed
them
which
i
did
i
always
borrow
pounds
so
our
young
friends
reduced
to
prose
which
is
much
to
be
regretted
degenerate
in
their
power
of
imparting
pleasure
to
me
why
should
i
go
to
see
them
therefore
absurd
through
the
beaming
smile
with
which
he
regarded
me
as
he
reasoned
thus
there
now
broke
forth
a
look
of
disinterested
benevolence
quite
astonishing
besides
he
said
pursuing
his
argument
in
his
tone
of
conviction
if
i
do
go
anywhere
for
pain
which
would
be
a
perversion
of
the
intention
of
my
being
and
a
monstrous
thing
to
do
why
should
i
go
anywhere
to
be
the
cause
of
pain
if
i
went
to
see
our
young
friends
in
their
present
state
of
mind
i
should
give
them
pain
the
associations
with
me
would
be
disagreeable
they
might
say
is
the
man
who
had
pounds
and
who
ca
pay
pounds
which
i
ca
of
course
nothing
could
be
more
out
of
the
question
then
kindness
requires
that
i
should
go
near
them
and
i
wo
he
finished
by
genially
kissing
my
hand
and
thanking
me
nothing
but
miss
summerson
fine
tact
he
said
would
have
found
this
out
for
him
i
was
much
disconcerted
but
i
reflected
that
if
the
main
point
were
gained
it
mattered
little
how
strangely
he
perverted
everything
leading
to
it
i
had
determined
to
mention
something
else
however
and
i
thought
i
was
not
to
be
put
off
in
that
skimpole
said
i
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
saying
before
i
conclude
my
visit
that
i
was
much
surprised
to
learn
on
the
best
authority
some
little
time
ago
that
you
knew
with
whom
that
poor
boy
left
bleak
house
and
that
you
accepted
a
present
on
that
occasion
i
have
not
mentioned
it
to
my
guardian
for
i
fear
it
would
hurt
him
unnecessarily
but
i
may
say
to
you
that
i
was
much
surprised
no
really
surprised
my
dear
miss
summerson
he
returned
inquiringly
raising
his
pleasant
eyebrows
greatly
surprised
he
thought
about
it
for
a
little
while
with
a
highly
agreeable
and
whimsical
expression
of
face
then
quite
gave
it
up
and
said
in
his
most
engaging
manner
you
know
what
a
child
i
am
why
surprised
i
was
reluctant
to
enter
minutely
into
that
question
but
as
he
begged
i
would
for
he
was
really
curious
to
know
i
gave
him
to
understand
in
the
gentlest
words
i
could
use
that
his
conduct
seemed
to
involve
a
disregard
of
several
moral
obligations
he
was
much
amused
and
interested
when
he
heard
this
and
said
no
really
with
ingenuous
simplicity
you
know
i
do
intend
to
be
responsible
i
never
could
do
it
responsibility
is
a
thing
that
has
always
been
above
me
or
below
me
said
skimpole
i
do
even
know
which
but
as
i
understand
the
way
in
which
my
dear
miss
summerson
always
remarkable
for
her
practical
good
sense
and
clearness
puts
this
case
i
should
imagine
it
was
chiefly
a
question
of
money
do
you
know
i
incautiously
gave
a
qualified
assent
to
this
ah
then
you
see
said
skimpole
shaking
his
head
i
am
hopeless
of
understanding
it
i
suggested
as
i
rose
to
go
that
it
was
not
right
to
betray
my
guardian
confidence
for
a
bribe
my
dear
miss
summerson
he
returned
with
a
candid
hilarity
that
was
all
his
own
i
ca
be
bribed
not
by
mr
bucket
said
i
no
said
he
not
by
anybody
i
do
attach
any
value
to
money
i
do
care
about
it
i
do
know
about
it
i
do
want
it
i
keep
it
it
goes
away
from
me
directly
how
can
i
be
bribed
i
showed
that
i
was
of
a
different
opinion
though
i
had
not
the
capacity
for
arguing
the
question
on
the
contrary
said
skimpole
i
am
exactly
the
man
to
be
placed
in
a
superior
position
in
such
a
case
as
that
i
am
above
the
rest
of
mankind
in
such
a
case
as
that
i
can
act
with
philosophy
in
such
a
case
as
that
i
am
not
warped
by
prejudices
as
an
italian
baby
is
by
bandages
i
am
as
free
as
the
air
i
feel
myself
as
far
above
suspicion
as
caesar
wife
anything
to
equal
the
lightness
of
his
manner
and
the
playful
impartiality
with
which
he
seemed
to
convince
himself
as
he
tossed
the
matter
about
like
a
ball
of
feathers
was
surely
never
seen
in
anybody
else
observe
the
case
my
dear
miss
summerson
here
is
a
boy
received
into
the
house
and
put
to
bed
in
a
state
that
i
strongly
object
to
the
boy
being
in
bed
a
man
arrives
like
the
house
that
jack
built
here
is
the
man
who
demands
the
boy
who
is
received
into
the
house
and
put
to
bed
in
a
state
that
i
strongly
object
to
here
is
a
produced
by
the
man
who
demands
the
boy
who
is
received
into
the
house
and
put
to
bed
in
a
state
that
i
strongly
object
to
here
is
the
skimpole
who
accepts
the
produced
by
the
man
who
demands
the
boy
who
is
received
into
the
house
and
put
to
bed
in
a
state
that
i
strongly
object
to
those
are
the
facts
very
well
should
the
skimpole
have
refused
the
note
why
should
the
skimpole
have
refused
the
note
skimpole
protests
to
bucket
this
for
i
do
understand
it
it
is
of
no
use
to
me
take
it
away
bucket
still
entreats
skimpole
to
accept
it
are
there
reasons
why
skimpole
not
being
warped
by
prejudices
should
accept
it
yes
skimpole
perceives
them
what
are
they
skimpole
reasons
with
himself
this
is
a
tamed
lynx
an
active
an
intelligent
man
a
person
of
a
peculiarly
directed
energy
and
great
subtlety
both
of
conception
and
execution
who
discovers
our
friends
and
enemies
for
us
when
they
run
away
recovers
our
property
for
us
when
we
are
robbed
avenges
us
comfortably
when
we
are
murdered
this
active
and
intelligent
man
has
acquired
in
the
exercise
of
his
art
a
strong
faith
in
money
he
finds
it
very
useful
to
him
and
he
makes
it
very
useful
to
society
shall
i
shake
that
faith
in
bucket
because
i
want
it
myself
shall
i
deliberately
blunt
one
of
bucket
weapons
shall
i
positively
paralyse
bucket
in
his
next
detective
operation
and
again
if
it
is
blameable
in
skimpole
to
take
the
note
it
is
blameable
in
bucket
to
offer
the
note
much
more
blameable
in
bucket
because
he
is
the
knowing
man
now
skimpole
wishes
to
think
well
of
bucket
skimpole
deems
it
essential
in
its
little
place
to
the
general
cohesion
of
things
that
he
should
think
well
of
bucket
the
state
expressly
asks
him
to
trust
to
bucket
and
he
does
and
all
he
does
i
had
nothing
to
offer
in
reply
to
this
exposition
and
therefore
took
my
leave
skimpole
however
who
was
in
excellent
spirits
would
not
hear
of
my
returning
home
attended
only
by
little
coavinses
and
accompanied
me
himself
he
entertained
me
on
the
way
with
a
variety
of
delightful
conversation
and
assured
me
at
parting
that
he
should
never
forget
the
fine
tact
with
which
i
had
found
that
out
for
him
about
our
young
friends
as
it
so
happened
that
i
never
saw
skimpole
again
i
may
at
once
finish
what
i
know
of
his
history
a
coolness
arose
between
him
and
my
guardian
based
principally
on
the
foregoing
grounds
and
on
his
having
heartlessly
disregarded
my
guardian
entreaties
as
we
afterwards
learned
from
ada
in
reference
to
richard
his
being
heavily
in
my
guardian
debt
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
separation
he
died
some
five
years
afterwards
and
left
a
diary
behind
him
with
letters
and
other
materials
towards
his
life
which
was
published
and
which
showed
him
to
have
been
the
victim
of
a
combination
on
the
part
of
mankind
against
an
amiable
child
it
was
considered
very
pleasant
reading
but
i
never
read
more
of
it
myself
than
the
sentence
on
which
i
chanced
to
light
on
opening
the
book
it
was
this
jarndyce
in
common
with
most
other
men
i
have
known
is
the
incarnation
of
selfishness
and
now
i
come
to
a
part
of
my
story
touching
myself
very
nearly
indeed
and
for
which
i
was
quite
unprepared
when
the
circumstance
occurred
whatever
little
lingerings
may
have
now
and
then
revived
in
my
mind
associated
with
my
poor
old
face
had
only
revived
as
belonging
to
a
part
of
my
life
that
was
gone
gone
like
my
infancy
or
my
childhood
i
have
suppressed
none
of
my
many
weaknesses
on
that
subject
but
have
written
them
as
faithfully
as
my
memory
has
recalled
them
and
i
hope
to
do
and
mean
to
do
the
same
down
to
the
last
words
of
these
pages
which
i
see
now
not
so
very
far
before
me
the
months
were
gliding
away
and
my
dear
girl
sustained
by
the
hopes
she
had
confided
in
me
was
the
same
beautiful
star
in
the
miserable
corner
richard
more
worn
and
haggard
haunted
the
court
day
after
day
listlessly
sat
there
the
whole
day
long
when
he
knew
there
was
no
remote
chance
of
the
suit
being
mentioned
and
became
one
of
the
stock
sights
of
the
place
i
wonder
whether
any
of
the
gentlemen
remembered
him
as
he
was
when
he
first
went
there
so
completely
was
he
absorbed
in
his
fixed
idea
that
he
used
to
avow
in
his
cheerful
moments
that
he
should
never
have
breathed
the
fresh
air
now
but
for
woodcourt
it
was
only
woodcourt
who
could
occasionally
divert
his
attention
for
a
few
hours
at
a
time
and
rouse
him
even
when
he
sunk
into
a
lethargy
of
mind
and
body
that
alarmed
us
greatly
and
the
returns
of
which
became
more
frequent
as
the
months
went
on
my
dear
girl
was
right
in
saying
that
he
only
pursued
his
errors
the
more
desperately
for
her
sake
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
desire
to
retrieve
what
he
had
lost
was
rendered
the
more
intense
by
his
grief
for
his
young
wife
and
became
like
the
madness
of
a
gamester
i
was
there
as
i
have
mentioned
at
all
hours
when
i
was
there
at
night
i
generally
went
home
with
charley
in
a
coach
sometimes
my
guardian
would
meet
me
in
the
neighbourhood
and
we
would
walk
home
together
one
evening
he
had
arranged
to
meet
me
at
eight
i
could
not
leave
as
i
usually
did
quite
punctually
at
the
time
for
i
was
working
for
my
dear
girl
and
had
a
few
stitches
more
to
do
to
finish
what
i
was
about
but
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
hour
when
i
bundled
up
my
little
gave
my
darling
my
last
kiss
for
the
night
and
hurried
downstairs
woodcourt
went
with
me
as
it
was
dusk
when
we
came
to
the
usual
place
of
meeting
it
was
close
by
and
woodcourt
had
often
accompanied
me
before
my
guardian
was
not
there
we
waited
half
an
hour
walking
up
and
down
but
there
were
no
signs
of
him
we
agreed
that
he
was
either
prevented
from
coming
or
that
he
had
come
and
gone
away
and
woodcourt
proposed
to
walk
home
with
me
it
was
the
first
walk
we
had
ever
taken
together
except
that
very
short
one
to
the
usual
place
of
meeting
we
spoke
of
richard
and
ada
the
whole
way
i
did
not
thank
him
in
words
for
what
he
had
done
my
appreciation
of
it
had
risen
above
all
words
then
but
i
hoped
he
might
not
be
without
some
understanding
of
what
i
felt
so
strongly
arriving
at
home
and
going
upstairs
we
found
that
my
guardian
was
out
and
that
woodcourt
was
out
too
we
were
in
the
very
same
room
into
which
i
had
brought
my
blushing
girl
when
her
youthful
lover
now
her
so
altered
husband
was
the
choice
of
her
young
heart
the
very
same
room
from
which
my
guardian
and
i
had
watched
them
going
away
through
the
sunlight
in
the
fresh
bloom
of
their
hope
and
promise
we
were
standing
by
the
opened
window
looking
down
into
the
street
when
woodcourt
spoke
to
me
i
learned
in
a
moment
that
he
loved
me
i
learned
in
a
moment
that
my
scarred
face
was
all
unchanged
to
him
i
learned
in
a
moment
that
what
i
had
thought
was
pity
and
compassion
was
devoted
generous
faithful
love
oh
too
late
to
know
it
now
too
late
too
late
that
was
the
first
ungrateful
thought
i
had
too
late
when
i
returned
he
told
me
when
i
came
back
no
richer
than
when
i
went
away
and
found
you
newly
risen
from
a
sick
bed
yet
so
inspired
by
sweet
consideration
for
others
and
so
free
from
a
selfish
thought
oh
woodcourt
forbear
forbear
i
entreated
him
i
do
not
deserve
your
high
praise
i
had
many
selfish
thoughts
at
that
time
many
heaven
knows
beloved
of
my
life
said
he
that
my
praise
is
not
a
lover
praise
but
the
truth
you
do
not
know
what
all
around
you
see
in
esther
summerson
how
many
hearts
she
touches
and
awakens
what
sacred
admiration
and
what
love
she
wins
oh
woodcourt
cried
i
it
is
a
great
thing
to
win
love
it
is
a
great
thing
to
win
love
i
am
proud
of
it
and
honoured
by
it
and
the
hearing
of
it
causes
me
to
shed
these
tears
of
mingled
joy
and
sorrow
joy
that
i
have
won
it
sorrow
that
i
have
not
deserved
it
better
but
i
am
not
free
to
think
of
yours
i
said
it
with
a
stronger
heart
for
when
he
praised
me
thus
and
when
i
heard
his
voice
thrill
with
his
belief
that
what
he
said
was
true
i
aspired
to
be
more
worthy
of
it
it
was
not
too
late
for
that
although
i
closed
this
unforeseen
page
in
my
life
i
could
be
worthier
of
it
all
through
my
life
and
it
was
a
comfort
to
me
and
an
impulse
to
me
and
i
felt
a
dignity
rise
up
within
me
that
was
derived
from
him
when
i
thought
so
he
broke
the
silence
i
should
poorly
show
the
trust
that
i
have
in
the
dear
one
who
will
evermore
be
as
dear
to
me
as
now
and
the
deep
earnestness
with
which
he
said
it
at
once
strengthened
me
and
made
me
weep
if
after
her
assurance
that
she
is
not
free
to
think
of
my
love
i
urged
it
dear
esther
let
me
only
tell
you
that
the
fond
idea
of
you
which
i
took
abroad
was
exalted
to
the
heavens
when
i
came
home
i
have
always
hoped
in
the
first
hour
when
i
seemed
to
stand
in
any
ray
of
good
fortune
to
tell
you
this
i
have
always
feared
that
i
should
tell
it
you
in
vain
my
hopes
and
fears
are
both
fulfilled
i
distress
you
i
have
said
enough
something
seemed
to
pass
into
my
place
that
was
like
the
angel
he
thought
me
and
i
felt
so
sorrowful
for
the
loss
he
had
sustained
i
wished
to
help
him
in
his
trouble
as
i
had
wished
to
do
when
he
showed
that
first
commiseration
for
me
dear
woodcourt
said
i
before
we
part
something
is
left
for
me
to
say
i
never
could
say
it
as
i
wish
i
never
shall
but
i
had
to
think
again
of
being
more
deserving
of
his
love
and
his
affliction
before
i
could
go
i
am
deeply
sensible
of
your
generosity
and
i
shall
treasure
its
remembrance
to
my
dying
hour
i
know
full
well
how
changed
i
am
i
know
you
are
not
unacquainted
with
my
history
and
i
know
what
a
noble
love
that
is
which
is
so
faithful
what
you
have
said
to
me
could
have
affected
me
so
much
from
no
other
lips
for
there
are
none
that
could
give
it
such
a
value
to
me
it
shall
not
be
lost
it
shall
make
me
better
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
turned
away
his
head
how
could
i
ever
be
worthy
of
those
tears
if
in
the
unchanged
intercourse
we
shall
have
together
in
tending
richard
and
ada
and
i
hope
in
many
happier
scenes
of
life
you
ever
find
anything
in
me
which
you
can
honestly
think
is
better
than
it
used
to
be
believe
that
it
will
have
sprung
up
from
and
that
i
shall
owe
it
to
you
and
never
believe
dear
dear
woodcourt
never
believe
that
i
forget
this
night
or
that
while
my
heart
beats
it
can
be
insensible
to
the
pride
and
joy
of
having
been
beloved
by
you
he
took
my
hand
and
kissed
it
he
was
like
himself
again
and
i
felt
still
more
encouraged
i
am
induced
by
what
you
said
just
now
said
i
to
hope
that
you
have
succeeded
in
your
endeavour
i
have
he
answered
with
such
help
from
jarndyce
as
you
who
know
him
so
well
can
imagine
him
to
have
rendered
me
i
have
succeeded
heaven
bless
him
for
it
said
i
giving
him
my
hand
and
heaven
bless
you
in
all
you
do
i
shall
do
it
better
for
the
wish
he
answered
it
will
make
me
enter
on
these
new
duties
as
on
another
sacred
trust
from
you
ah
richard
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
what
will
he
do
when
you
are
gone
i
am
not
required
to
go
yet
i
would
not
desert
him
dear
miss
summerson
even
if
i
were
one
other
thing
i
felt
it
needful
to
touch
upon
before
he
left
me
i
knew
that
i
should
not
be
worthier
of
the
love
i
could
not
take
if
i
reserved
it
woodcourt
said
i
you
will
be
glad
to
know
from
my
lips
before
i
say
good
night
that
in
the
future
which
is
clear
and
bright
before
me
i
am
most
happy
most
fortunate
have
nothing
to
regret
or
desire
it
was
indeed
a
glad
hearing
to
him
he
replied
from
my
childhood
i
have
been
said
i
the
object
of
the
untiring
goodness
of
the
best
of
human
beings
to
whom
i
am
so
bound
by
every
tie
of
attachment
gratitude
and
love
that
nothing
i
could
do
in
the
compass
of
a
life
could
express
the
feelings
of
a
single
day
i
share
those
feelings
he
returned
you
speak
of
mr
jarndyce
you
know
his
virtues
well
said
i
but
few
can
know
the
greatness
of
his
character
as
i
know
it
all
its
highest
and
best
qualities
have
been
revealed
to
me
in
nothing
more
brightly
than
in
the
shaping
out
of
that
future
in
which
i
am
so
happy
and
if
your
highest
homage
and
respect
had
not
been
his
already
which
i
know
they
are
they
would
have
been
his
i
think
on
this
assurance
and
in
the
feeling
it
would
have
awakened
in
you
towards
him
for
my
sake
he
fervently
replied
that
indeed
indeed
they
would
have
been
i
gave
him
my
hand
again
good
night
i
said
the
first
until
we
meet
the
second
as
a
farewell
to
this
theme
between
us
for
ever
yes
good
night
he
left
me
and
i
stood
at
the
dark
window
watching
the
street
his
love
in
all
its
constancy
and
generosity
had
come
so
suddenly
upon
me
that
he
had
not
left
me
a
minute
when
my
fortitude
gave
way
again
and
the
street
was
blotted
out
by
my
rushing
tears
but
they
were
not
tears
of
regret
and
sorrow
no
he
had
called
me
the
beloved
of
his
life
and
had
said
i
would
be
evermore
as
dear
to
him
as
i
was
then
and
i
felt
as
if
my
heart
would
not
hold
the
triumph
of
having
heard
those
words
my
first
wild
thought
had
died
away
it
was
not
too
late
to
hear
them
for
it
was
not
too
late
to
be
animated
by
them
to
be
good
true
grateful
and
contented
how
easy
my
path
how
much
easier
than
his
chapter
lxii
another
discovery
i
had
not
the
courage
to
see
any
one
that
night
i
had
not
even
the
courage
to
see
myself
for
i
was
afraid
that
my
tears
might
a
little
reproach
me
i
went
up
to
my
room
in
the
dark
and
prayed
in
the
dark
and
lay
down
in
the
dark
to
sleep
i
had
no
need
of
any
light
to
read
my
guardian
letter
by
for
i
knew
it
by
heart
i
took
it
from
the
place
where
i
kept
it
and
repeated
its
contents
by
its
own
clear
light
of
integrity
and
love
and
went
to
sleep
with
it
on
my
pillow
i
was
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
called
charley
to
come
for
a
walk
we
bought
flowers
for
the
and
came
back
and
arranged
them
and
were
as
busy
as
possible
we
were
so
early
that
i
had
a
good
time
still
for
charley
lesson
before
breakfast
charley
who
was
not
in
the
least
improved
in
the
old
defective
article
of
grammar
came
through
it
with
great
applause
and
we
were
altogether
very
notable
when
my
guardian
appeared
he
said
why
little
woman
you
look
fresher
than
your
flowers
and
woodcourt
repeated
and
translated
a
passage
from
the
mewlinnwillinwodd
expressive
of
my
being
like
a
mountain
with
the
sun
upon
it
this
was
all
so
pleasant
that
i
hope
it
made
me
still
more
like
the
mountain
than
i
had
been
before
after
breakfast
i
waited
my
opportunity
and
peeped
about
a
little
until
i
saw
my
guardian
in
his
own
room
the
room
of
last
night
by
himself
then
i
made
an
excuse
to
go
in
with
my
housekeeping
keys
shutting
the
door
after
me
well
dame
durden
said
my
guardian
the
post
had
brought
him
several
letters
and
he
was
writing
you
want
money
no
indeed
i
have
plenty
in
hand
there
never
was
such
a
dame
durden
said
my
guardian
for
making
money
last
he
had
laid
down
his
pen
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
looking
at
me
i
have
often
spoken
of
his
bright
face
but
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
it
look
so
bright
and
good
there
was
a
high
happiness
upon
it
which
made
me
think
he
has
been
doing
some
great
kindness
this
morning
there
never
was
said
my
guardian
musing
as
he
smiled
upon
me
such
a
dame
durden
for
making
money
last
he
had
never
yet
altered
his
old
manner
i
loved
it
and
him
so
much
that
when
i
now
went
up
to
him
and
took
my
usual
chair
which
was
always
put
at
his
side
for
sometimes
i
read
to
him
and
sometimes
i
talked
to
him
and
sometimes
i
silently
worked
by
him
i
hardly
liked
to
disturb
it
by
laying
my
hand
on
his
breast
but
i
found
i
did
not
disturb
it
at
all
dear
guardian
said
i
i
want
to
speak
to
you
have
i
been
remiss
in
anything
remiss
in
anything
my
dear
have
i
not
been
what
i
have
meant
to
be
since
i
brought
the
answer
to
your
letter
guardian
you
have
been
everything
i
could
desire
my
love
i
am
very
glad
indeed
to
hear
that
i
returned
you
know
you
said
to
me
was
this
the
mistress
of
bleak
house
and
i
said
yes
yes
said
my
guardian
nodding
his
head
he
had
put
his
arm
about
me
as
if
there
were
something
to
protect
me
from
and
looked
in
my
face
smiling
since
then
said
i
we
have
never
spoken
on
the
subject
except
once
and
then
i
said
bleak
house
was
thinning
fast
and
so
it
was
my
dear
and
i
said
i
timidly
reminded
him
but
its
mistress
remained
he
still
held
me
in
the
same
protecting
manner
and
with
the
same
bright
goodness
in
his
face
dear
guardian
said
i
i
know
how
you
have
felt
all
that
has
happened
and
how
considerate
you
have
been
as
so
much
time
has
passed
and
as
you
spoke
only
this
morning
of
my
being
so
well
again
perhaps
you
expect
me
to
renew
the
subject
perhaps
i
ought
to
do
so
i
will
be
the
mistress
of
bleak
house
when
you
please
see
he
returned
gaily
what
a
sympathy
there
must
be
between
us
i
have
had
nothing
else
poor
rick
excepted
it
a
large
exception
in
my
mind
when
you
came
in
i
was
full
of
it
when
shall
we
give
bleak
house
its
mistress
little
woman
when
you
please
next
month
next
month
dear
guardian
the
day
on
which
i
take
the
happiest
and
best
step
of
my
life
the
day
on
which
i
shall
be
a
man
more
exulting
and
more
enviable
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
the
day
on
which
i
give
bleak
house
its
little
mistress
shall
be
next
month
then
said
my
guardian
i
put
my
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
just
as
i
had
done
on
the
day
when
i
brought
my
answer
a
servant
came
to
the
door
to
announce
bucket
which
was
quite
unnecessary
for
bucket
was
already
looking
in
over
the
shoulder
jarndyce
and
miss
summerson
said
he
rather
out
of
breath
with
all
apologies
for
intruding
will
you
allow
me
to
order
up
a
person
that
on
the
stairs
and
that
objects
to
being
left
there
in
case
of
becoming
the
subject
of
observations
in
his
absence
thank
you
be
so
good
as
chair
that
there
member
in
this
direction
will
you
said
bucket
beckoning
over
the
banisters
this
singular
request
produced
an
old
man
in
a
black
unable
to
walk
who
was
carried
up
by
a
couple
of
bearers
and
deposited
in
the
room
near
the
door
bucket
immediately
got
rid
of
the
bearers
mysteriously
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
now
you
see
jarndyce
he
then
began
putting
down
his
hat
and
opening
his
subject
with
a
flourish
of
his
finger
you
know
me
and
miss
summerson
knows
me
this
gentleman
likewise
knows
me
and
his
name
is
smallweed
the
discounting
line
is
his
line
principally
and
he
what
you
may
call
a
dealer
in
bills
about
what
you
are
you
know
ai
you
said
bucket
stopping
a
little
to
address
the
gentleman
in
question
who
was
exceedingly
suspicious
of
him
he
seemed
about
to
dispute
this
designation
of
himself
when
he
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
now
moral
you
know
said
bucket
improving
the
accident
do
you
contradict
when
there
ai
no
occasion
and
you
wo
be
took
in
that
way
now
jarndyce
i
address
myself
to
you
been
negotiating
with
this
gentleman
on
behalf
of
sir
leicester
dedlock
baronet
and
one
way
and
another
i
been
in
and
out
and
about
his
premises
a
deal
his
premises
are
the
premises
formerly
occupied
by
krook
marine
store
dealer
a
relation
of
this
gentleman
that
you
saw
in
his
lifetime
if
i
do
mistake
my
guardian
replied
yes
well
you
are
to
understand
said
bucket
that
this
gentleman
he
come
into
krook
property
and
a
good
deal
of
magpie
property
there
was
vast
lots
of
among
the
rest
lord
bless
you
of
no
use
to
nobody
the
cunning
of
bucket
eye
and
the
masterly
manner
in
which
he
contrived
without
a
look
or
a
word
against
which
his
watchful
auditor
could
protest
to
let
us
know
that
he
stated
the
case
according
to
previous
agreement
and
could
say
much
more
of
smallweed
if
he
thought
it
advisable
deprived
us
of
any
merit
in
quite
understanding
him
his
difficulty
was
increased
by
smallweed
being
deaf
as
well
as
suspicious
and
watching
his
face
with
the
closest
attention
among
them
odd
heaps
of
old
papers
this
gentleman
when
he
comes
into
the
property
naturally
begins
to
rummage
do
you
see
said
bucket
to
which
say
that
again
cried
smallweed
in
a
shrill
sharp
voice
to
rummage
repeated
bucket
being
a
prudent
man
and
accustomed
to
take
care
of
your
own
affairs
you
begin
to
rummage
among
the
papers
as
you
have
come
into
do
you
of
course
i
do
cried
smallweed
of
course
you
do
said
bucket
conversationally
and
much
to
blame
you
would
be
if
you
did
and
so
you
chance
to
find
you
know
bucket
went
on
stooping
over
him
with
an
air
of
cheerful
raillery
which
smallweed
by
no
means
reciprocated
and
so
you
chance
to
find
you
know
a
paper
with
the
signature
of
jarndyce
to
it
do
you
smallweed
glanced
with
a
troubled
eye
at
us
and
grudgingly
nodded
assent
and
coming
to
look
at
that
paper
at
your
full
leisure
and
convenience
all
in
good
time
for
you
not
curious
to
read
it
and
why
should
you
be
what
do
you
find
it
to
be
but
a
will
you
see
that
the
drollery
of
it
said
bucket
with
the
same
lively
air
of
recalling
a
joke
for
the
enjoyment
of
smallweed
who
still
had
the
same
appearance
of
not
enjoying
it
at
all
what
do
you
find
it
to
be
but
a
will
i
do
know
that
it
good
as
a
will
or
as
anything
else
snarled
smallweed
bucket
eyed
the
old
man
for
a
moment
he
had
slipped
and
shrunk
down
in
his
chair
into
a
mere
bundle
as
if
he
were
much
disposed
to
pounce
upon
him
nevertheless
he
continued
to
bend
over
him
with
the
same
agreeable
air
keeping
the
corner
of
one
of
his
eyes
upon
us
notwithstanding
which
said
bucket
you
get
a
little
doubtful
and
uncomfortable
in
your
mind
about
it
having
a
very
tender
mind
of
your
own
eh
what
do
you
say
i
have
got
of
my
own
asked
smallweed
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
a
very
tender
mind
ho
well
go
on
said
smallweed
and
as
you
heard
a
good
deal
mentioned
regarding
a
celebrated
chancery
will
case
of
the
same
name
and
as
you
know
what
a
card
krook
was
for
buying
all
manner
of
old
pieces
of
furniter
and
books
and
papers
and
what
not
and
never
liking
to
part
with
and
always
to
teach
himself
to
read
you
begin
to
think
and
you
never
was
more
correct
in
your
born
days
if
i
do
look
about
me
i
may
get
into
trouble
regarding
this
will
now
mind
how
you
put
it
bucket
cried
the
old
man
anxiously
with
his
hand
at
his
ear
speak
up
none
of
your
brimstone
tricks
pick
me
up
i
want
to
hear
better
oh
lord
i
am
shaken
to
bits
bucket
had
certainly
picked
him
up
at
a
dart
however
as
soon
as
he
could
be
heard
through
smallweed
coughing
and
his
vicious
ejaculations
of
oh
my
bones
oh
dear
i
no
breath
in
my
body
i
worse
than
the
chattering
clattering
brimstone
pig
at
home
bucket
proceeded
in
the
same
convivial
manner
as
before
so
as
i
happen
to
be
in
the
habit
of
coming
about
your
premises
you
take
me
into
your
confidence
do
you
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
an
admission
with
more
ill
will
and
a
worse
grace
than
smallweed
displayed
when
he
admitted
this
rendering
it
perfectly
evident
that
bucket
was
the
very
last
person
he
would
have
thought
of
taking
into
his
confidence
if
he
could
by
any
possibility
have
kept
him
out
of
it
and
i
go
into
the
business
with
you
very
pleasant
we
are
over
it
and
i
confirm
you
in
your
fears
that
you
will
get
yourself
into
a
most
precious
line
if
you
do
come
out
with
that
there
will
said
bucket
emphatically
and
accordingly
you
arrange
with
me
that
it
shall
be
delivered
up
to
this
present
jarndyce
on
no
conditions
if
it
should
prove
to
be
valuable
you
trusting
yourself
to
him
for
your
reward
that
about
where
it
is
ai
it
that
what
was
agreed
smallweed
assented
with
the
same
bad
grace
in
consequence
of
which
said
bucket
dismissing
his
agreeable
manner
all
at
once
and
becoming
strictly
you
got
that
will
upon
your
person
at
the
present
time
and
the
only
thing
that
remains
for
you
to
do
is
just
to
out
with
it
having
given
us
one
glance
out
of
the
watching
corner
of
his
eye
and
having
given
his
nose
one
triumphant
rub
with
his
forefinger
bucket
stood
with
his
eyes
fastened
on
his
confidential
friend
and
his
hand
stretched
forth
ready
to
take
the
paper
and
present
it
to
my
guardian
it
was
not
produced
without
much
reluctance
and
many
declarations
on
the
part
of
smallweed
that
he
was
a
poor
industrious
man
and
that
he
left
it
to
jarndyce
honour
not
to
let
him
lose
by
his
honesty
little
by
little
he
very
slowly
took
from
a
a
stained
discoloured
paper
which
was
much
singed
upon
the
outside
and
a
little
burnt
at
the
edges
as
if
it
had
long
ago
been
thrown
upon
a
fire
and
hastily
snatched
off
again
bucket
lost
no
time
in
transferring
this
paper
with
the
dexterity
of
a
conjuror
from
smallweed
to
jarndyce
as
he
gave
it
to
my
guardian
he
whispered
behind
his
fingers
had
settled
how
to
make
their
market
of
it
quarrelled
and
hinted
about
it
i
laid
out
twenty
pound
upon
it
first
the
avaricious
grandchildren
split
upon
him
on
account
of
their
objections
to
his
living
so
unreasonably
long
and
then
they
split
on
one
another
lord
there
ai
one
of
the
family
that
would
sell
the
other
for
a
pound
or
two
except
the
old
lady
and
she
only
out
of
it
because
she
too
weak
in
her
mind
to
drive
a
bargain
mr
bucket
said
my
guardian
aloud
whatever
the
worth
of
this
paper
may
be
to
any
one
my
obligations
are
great
to
you
and
if
it
be
of
any
worth
i
hold
myself
bound
to
see
smallweed
remunerated
accordingly
not
according
to
your
merits
you
know
said
bucket
in
friendly
explanation
to
smallweed
do
you
be
afraid
of
that
according
to
its
value
that
is
what
i
mean
said
my
guardian
you
may
observe
bucket
that
i
abstain
from
examining
this
paper
myself
the
plain
truth
is
i
have
forsworn
and
abjured
the
whole
business
these
many
years
and
my
soul
is
sick
of
it
but
miss
summerson
and
i
will
immediately
place
the
paper
in
the
hands
of
my
solicitor
in
the
cause
and
its
existence
shall
be
made
known
without
delay
to
all
other
parties
interested
jarndyce
ca
say
fairer
than
that
you
understand
observed
bucket
to
his
and
it
being
now
made
clear
to
you
that
nobody
to
be
wronged
which
must
be
a
great
relief
to
your
mind
we
may
proceed
with
the
ceremony
of
chairing
you
home
again
he
unbolted
the
door
called
in
the
bearers
wished
us
good
morning
and
with
a
look
full
of
meaning
and
a
crook
of
his
finger
at
parting
went
his
way
we
went
our
way
too
which
was
to
lincoln
inn
as
quickly
as
possible
kenge
was
disengaged
and
we
found
him
at
his
table
in
his
dusty
room
with
the
books
and
the
piles
of
papers
chairs
having
been
placed
for
us
by
guppy
kenge
expressed
the
surprise
and
gratification
he
felt
at
the
unusual
sight
of
jarndyce
in
his
office
he
turned
over
his
double
as
he
spoke
and
was
more
conversation
kenge
than
ever
i
hope
said
kenge
that
the
genial
influence
of
miss
summerson
he
bowed
to
me
may
have
induced
jarndyce
he
bowed
to
him
to
forego
some
little
of
his
animosity
towards
a
cause
and
towards
a
court
which
are
shall
i
say
which
take
their
place
in
the
stately
vista
of
the
pillars
of
our
profession
i
am
inclined
to
think
returned
my
guardian
that
miss
summerson
has
seen
too
much
of
the
effects
of
the
court
and
the
cause
to
exert
any
influence
in
their
favour
nevertheless
they
are
a
part
of
the
occasion
of
my
being
here
kenge
before
i
lay
this
paper
on
your
desk
and
have
done
with
it
let
me
tell
you
how
it
has
come
into
my
hands
he
did
so
shortly
and
distinctly
it
could
not
sir
said
kenge
have
been
stated
more
plainly
and
to
the
purpose
if
it
had
been
a
case
at
law
did
you
ever
know
english
law
or
equity
either
plain
and
to
the
purpose
said
my
guardian
oh
fie
said
kenge
at
first
he
had
not
seemed
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
paper
but
when
he
saw
it
he
appeared
more
interested
and
when
he
had
opened
and
read
a
little
of
it
through
his
he
became
amazed
jarndyce
he
said
looking
off
it
you
have
perused
this
not
i
returned
my
guardian
but
my
dear
sir
said
kenge
it
is
a
will
of
later
date
than
any
in
the
suit
it
appears
to
be
all
in
the
testator
handwriting
it
is
duly
executed
and
attested
and
even
if
intended
to
be
cancelled
as
might
possibly
be
supposed
to
be
denoted
by
these
marks
of
fire
it
is
not
cancelled
here
it
is
a
perfect
instrument
well
said
my
guardian
what
is
that
to
me
mr
guppy
cried
kenge
raising
his
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
jarndyce
sir
vholes
of
symond
inn
my
compliments
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
glad
to
speak
with
him
guppy
disappeared
you
ask
me
what
is
this
to
you
jarndyce
if
you
had
perused
this
document
you
would
have
seen
that
it
reduces
your
interest
considerably
though
still
leaving
it
a
very
handsome
one
still
leaving
it
a
very
handsome
one
said
kenge
waving
his
hand
persuasively
and
blandly
you
would
further
have
seen
that
the
interests
of
richard
carstone
and
of
miss
ada
clare
now
richard
carstone
are
very
materially
advanced
by
it
kenge
said
my
guardian
if
all
the
flourishing
wealth
that
the
suit
brought
into
this
vile
court
of
chancery
could
fall
to
my
two
young
cousins
i
should
be
well
contented
but
do
you
ask
me
to
believe
that
any
good
is
to
come
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
oh
really
jarndyce
prejudice
prejudice
my
dear
sir
this
is
a
very
great
country
a
very
great
country
its
system
of
equity
is
a
very
great
system
a
very
great
system
really
really
my
guardian
said
no
more
and
vholes
arrived
he
was
modestly
impressed
by
kenge
professional
eminence
how
do
you
do
vholes
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
take
a
chair
here
by
me
and
look
over
this
paper
vholes
did
as
he
was
asked
and
seemed
to
read
it
every
word
he
was
not
excited
by
it
but
he
was
not
excited
by
anything
when
he
had
well
examined
it
he
retired
with
kenge
into
a
window
and
shading
his
mouth
with
his
black
glove
spoke
to
him
at
some
length
i
was
not
surprised
to
observe
kenge
inclined
to
dispute
what
he
said
before
he
had
said
much
for
i
knew
that
no
two
people
ever
did
agree
about
anything
in
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
but
he
seemed
to
get
the
better
of
kenge
too
in
a
conversation
that
sounded
as
if
it
were
almost
composed
of
the
words
report
estate
and
costs
when
they
had
finished
they
came
back
to
kenge
table
and
spoke
aloud
well
but
this
is
a
very
remarkable
document
vholes
said
kenge
vholes
said
very
much
so
and
a
very
important
document
vholes
said
kenge
again
vholes
said
very
much
so
and
as
you
say
vholes
when
the
cause
is
in
the
paper
next
term
this
document
will
be
an
unexpected
and
interesting
feature
in
it
said
kenge
looking
loftily
at
my
guardian
vholes
was
gratified
as
a
smaller
practitioner
striving
to
keep
respectable
to
be
confirmed
in
any
opinion
of
his
own
by
such
an
authority
and
when
asked
my
guardian
rising
after
a
pause
during
which
kenge
had
rattled
his
money
and
vholes
had
picked
his
pimples
when
is
next
term
next
term
jarndyce
will
be
next
month
said
kenge
of
course
we
shall
at
once
proceed
to
do
what
is
necessary
with
this
document
and
to
collect
the
necessary
evidence
concerning
it
and
of
course
you
will
receive
our
usual
notification
of
the
cause
being
in
the
paper
to
which
i
shall
pay
of
course
my
usual
attention
still
bent
my
dear
sir
said
kenge
showing
us
through
the
outer
office
to
the
door
still
bent
even
with
your
enlarged
mind
on
echoing
a
popular
prejudice
we
are
a
prosperous
community
jarndyce
a
very
prosperous
community
we
are
a
great
country
jarndyce
we
are
a
very
great
country
this
is
a
great
system
jarndyce
and
would
you
wish
a
great
country
to
have
a
little
system
now
really
really
he
said
this
at
the
gently
moving
his
right
hand
as
if
it
were
a
silver
trowel
with
which
to
spread
the
cement
of
his
words
on
the
structure
of
the
system
and
consolidate
it
for
a
thousand
ages
chapter

the

and
george
himself
is
at
chesney
wold
attending
on
sir
leicester
in
his
rides
and
riding
very
near
his
because
of
the
uncertain
hand
with
which
he
guides
his
horse
but
not
is
george
so
occupied
he
is
journeying
into
the
iron
country
farther
north
to
look
about
him
as
he
comes
into
the
iron
country
farther
north
such
fresh
green
woods
as
those
of
chesney
wold
are
left
behind
and
coal
pits
and
ashes
high
chimneys
and
red
bricks
blighted
verdure
scorching
fires
and
a
heavy
cloud
of
smoke
become
the
features
of
the
scenery
among
such
objects
rides
the
trooper
looking
about
him
and
always
looking
for
something
he
has
come
to
find
at
last
on
the
black
canal
bridge
of
a
busy
town
with
a
clang
of
iron
in
it
and
more
fires
and
more
smoke
than
he
has
seen
yet
the
trooper
swart
with
the
dust
of
the
coal
roads
checks
his
horse
and
asks
a
workman
does
he
know
the
name
of
rouncewell
thereabouts
why
master
quoth
the
workman
do
i
know
my
own
name
is
so
well
known
here
is
it
comrade
asks
the
trooper
rouncewell
ah
you
right
and
where
might
it
be
now
asks
the
trooper
with
a
glance
before
him
the
bank
the
factory
or
the
house
the
workman
wants
to
know
hum
rouncewell
is
so
great
apparently
mutters
the
trooper
stroking
his
chin
that
i
have
as
good
as
half
a
mind
to
go
back
again
why
i
do
know
which
i
want
should
i
find
rouncewell
at
the
factory
do
you
think
tai
easy
to
say
where
you
find
him
at
this
time
of
the
day
you
might
find
either
him
or
his
son
there
if
he
in
town
but
his
contracts
take
him
away
and
which
is
the
factory
why
he
sees
those
chimneys
the
tallest
ones
yes
he
sees
them
well
let
him
keep
his
eye
on
those
chimneys
going
on
as
straight
as
ever
he
can
and
presently
see
down
a
turning
on
the
left
shut
in
by
a
great
brick
wall
which
forms
one
side
of
the
street
that
rouncewell
the
trooper
thanks
his
informant
and
rides
slowly
on
looking
about
him
he
does
not
turn
back
but
puts
up
his
horse
and
is
much
disposed
to
groom
him
too
at
a
where
some
of
rouncewell
hands
are
dining
as
the
ostler
tells
him
some
of
rouncewell
hands
have
just
knocked
off
for
and
seem
to
be
invading
the
whole
town
they
are
very
sinewy
and
strong
are
rouncewell
hands
a
little
sooty
too
he
comes
to
a
gateway
in
the
brick
wall
looks
in
and
sees
a
great
perplexity
of
iron
lying
about
in
every
stage
and
in
a
vast
variety
of
shapes
in
bars
in
wedges
in
sheets
in
tanks
in
boilers
in
axles
in
wheels
in
cogs
in
cranks
in
rails
twisted
and
wrenched
into
eccentric
and
perverse
forms
as
separate
parts
of
machinery
mountains
of
it
broken
up
and
rusty
in
its
age
distant
furnaces
of
it
glowing
and
bubbling
in
its
youth
bright
fireworks
of
it
showering
about
under
the
blows
of
the
iron
iron
iron
an
iron
taste
an
iron
smell
and
a
babel
of
iron
sounds
this
is
a
place
to
make
a
man
head
ache
too
says
the
trooper
looking
about
him
for
a
who
comes
here
this
is
very
like
me
before
i
was
set
up
this
ought
to
be
my
nephew
if
likenesses
run
in
families
your
servant

looking
for
any
one
excuse
me
young
rouncewell
i
believe
yes
i
was
looking
for
your
father
sir
i
wish
to
have
a
word
with
him
the
young
man
telling
him
he
is
fortunate
in
his
choice
of
a
time
for
his
father
is
there
leads
the
way
to
the
office
where
he
is
to
be
found
very
like
me
before
i
was
set
up
devilish
like
me
thinks
the
trooper
as
he
follows
they
come
to
a
building
in
the
yard
with
an
office
on
an
upper
floor
at
sight
of
the
gentleman
in
the
office
george
turns
very
red
what
name
shall
i
say
to
my
father
asks
the
young
man
george
full
of
the
idea
of
iron
in
desperation
answers
steel
and
is
so
presented
he
is
left
alone
with
the
gentleman
in
the
office
who
sits
at
a
table
with
before
him
and
some
sheets
of
paper
blotted
with
hosts
of
figures
and
drawings
of
cunning
shapes
it
is
a
bare
office
with
bare
windows
looking
on
the
iron
view
below
tumbled
together
on
the
table
are
some
pieces
of
iron
purposely
broken
to
be
tested
at
various
periods
of
their
service
in
various
capacities
there
is
on
everything
and
the
smoke
is
seen
through
the
windows
rolling
heavily
out
of
the
tall
chimneys
to
mingle
with
the
smoke
from
a
vaporous
babylon
of
other
chimneys
i
am
at
your
service
steel
says
the
gentleman
when
his
visitor
has
taken
a
rusty
chair
well
rouncewell
george
replies
leaning
forward
with
his
left
arm
on
his
knee
and
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
very
chary
of
meeting
his
brother
eye
i
am
not
without
my
expectations
that
in
the
present
visit
i
may
prove
to
be
more
free
than
welcome
i
have
served
as
a
dragoon
in
my
day
and
a
comrade
of
mine
that
i
was
once
rather
partial
to
was
if
i
do
deceive
myself
a
brother
of
yours
i
believe
you
had
a
brother
who
gave
his
family
some
trouble
and
ran
away
and
never
did
any
good
but
in
keeping
away
are
you
quite
sure
returns
the
ironmaster
in
an
altered
voice
that
your
name
is
steel
the
trooper
falters
and
looks
at
him
his
brother
starts
up
calls
him
by
his
name
and
grasps
him
by
both
hands
you
are
too
quick
for
me
cries
the
trooper
with
the
tears
springing
out
of
his
eyes
how
do
you
do
my
dear
old
fellow
i
never
could
have
thought
you
would
have
been
half
so
glad
to
see
me
as
all
this
how
do
you
do
my
dear
old
fellow
how
do
you
do
they
shake
hands
and
embrace
each
other
over
and
over
again
the
trooper
still
coupling
his
how
do
you
do
my
dear
old
fellow
with
his
protestation
that
he
never
thought
his
brother
would
have
been
half
so
glad
to
see
him
as
all
this
so
far
from
it
he
declares
at
the
end
of
a
full
account
of
what
has
preceded
his
arrival
there
i
had
very
little
idea
of
making
myself
known
i
thought
if
you
took
by
any
means
forgivingly
to
my
name
i
might
gradually
get
myself
up
to
the
point
of
writing
a
letter
but
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
brother
if
you
had
considered
it
anything
but
welcome
news
to
hear
of
me
we
will
show
you
at
home
what
kind
of
news
we
think
it
george
returns
his
brother
this
is
a
great
day
at
home
and
you
could
not
have
arrived
you
bronzed
old
soldier
on
a
better
i
make
an
agreement
with
my
son
watt
that
on
this
day
twelvemonth
he
shall
marry
as
pretty
and
as
good
a
girl
as
you
have
seen
in
all
your
travels
she
goes
to
germany
with
one
of
your
nieces
for
a
little
polishing
up
in
her
education
we
make
a
feast
of
the
event
and
you
will
be
made
the
hero
of
it
george
is
so
entirely
overcome
at
first
by
this
prospect
that
he
resists
the
proposed
honour
with
great
earnestness
being
overborne
however
by
his
brother
and
his
nephew
concerning
whom
he
renews
his
protestations
that
he
never
could
have
thought
they
would
have
been
half
so
glad
to
see
him
he
is
taken
home
to
an
elegant
house
in
all
the
arrangements
of
which
there
is
to
be
observed
a
pleasant
mixture
of
the
originally
simple
habits
of
the
father
and
mother
with
such
as
are
suited
to
their
altered
station
and
the
higher
fortunes
of
their
children
here
george
is
much
dismayed
by
the
graces
and
accomplishments
of
his
nieces
that
are
and
by
the
beauty
of
rosa
his
niece
that
is
to
be
and
by
the
affectionate
salutations
of
these
young
ladies
which
he
receives
in
a
sort
of
dream
he
is
sorely
taken
aback
too
by
the
dutiful
behaviour
of
his
nephew
and
has
a
woeful
consciousness
upon
him
of
being
a
scapegrace
however
there
is
great
rejoicing
and
a
very
hearty
company
and
infinite
enjoyment
and
george
comes
bluff
and
martial
through
it
all
and
his
pledge
to
be
present
at
the
marriage
and
give
away
the
bride
is
received
with
universal
favour
a
whirling
head
has
george
that
night
when
he
lies
down
in
the
of
his
brother
house
to
think
of
all
these
things
and
to
see
the
images
of
his
nieces
awful
all
the
evening
in
their
floating
muslins
waltzing
after
the
german
manner
over
his
counterpane
the
brothers
are
closeted
next
morning
in
the
ironmaster
room
where
the
elder
is
proceeding
in
his
clear
sensible
way
to
show
how
he
thinks
he
may
best
dispose
of
george
in
his
business
when
george
squeezes
his
hand
and
stops
him
brother
i
thank
you
a
million
times
for
your
more
than
brotherly
welcome
and
a
million
times
more
to
that
for
your
more
than
brotherly
intentions
but
my
plans
are
made
before
i
say
a
word
as
to
them
i
wish
to
consult
you
upon
one
family
point
how
says
the
trooper
folding
his
arms
and
looking
with
indomitable
firmness
at
his
brother
how
is
my
mother
to
be
got
to
scratch
me
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
george
replies
the
ironmaster
i
say
brother
how
is
my
mother
to
be
got
to
scratch
me
she
must
be
got
to
do
it
somehow
scratch
you
out
of
her
will
i
think
you
mean
of
course
i
do
in
short
says
the
trooper
folding
his
arms
more
resolutely
yet
i
mean
to
scratch
me
my
dear
george
returns
his
brother
is
it
so
indispensable
that
you
should
undergo
that
process
quite
absolutely
i
could
be
guilty
of
the
meanness
of
coming
back
without
it
i
should
never
be
safe
not
to
be
off
again
i
have
not
sneaked
home
to
rob
your
children
if
not
yourself
brother
of
your
rights
i
who
forfeited
mine
long
ago
if
i
am
to
remain
and
hold
up
my
head
i
must
be
scratched
come
you
are
a
man
of
celebrated
penetration
and
intelligence
and
you
can
tell
me
how
to
be
brought
about
i
can
tell
you
george
replies
the
ironmaster
deliberately
how
it
is
not
to
be
brought
about
which
i
hope
may
answer
the
purpose
as
well
look
at
our
mother
think
of
her
recall
her
emotion
when
she
recovered
you
do
you
believe
there
is
a
consideration
in
the
world
that
would
induce
her
to
take
such
a
step
against
her
favourite
son
do
you
believe
there
is
any
chance
of
her
consent
to
balance
against
the
outrage
it
would
be
to
her
loving
dear
old
lady
to
propose
it
if
you
do
you
are
wrong
no
george
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
remain
unscratched
i
think
there
is
an
amused
smile
on
the
ironmaster
face
as
he
watches
his
brother
who
is
pondering
deeply
disappointed
i
think
you
may
manage
almost
as
well
as
if
the
thing
were
done
though
how
brother
being
bent
upon
it
you
can
dispose
by
will
of
anything
you
have
the
misfortune
to
inherit
in
any
way
you
like
you
know
that
true
says
the
trooper
pondering
again
then
he
wistfully
asks
with
his
hand
on
his
brother
would
you
mind
mentioning
that
brother
to
your
wife
and
family
not
at
all
thank
you
you
would
object
to
say
perhaps
that
although
an
undoubted
vagabond
i
am
a
vagabond
of
the
order
and
not
of
the
mean
sort
the
ironmaster
repressing
his
amused
smile
assents
thank
you
thank
you
it
a
weight
off
my
mind
says
the
trooper
with
a
heave
of
his
chest
as
he
unfolds
his
arms
and
puts
a
hand
on
each
leg
though
i
had
set
my
heart
on
being
scratched
too
the
brothers
are
very
like
each
other
sitting
face
to
face
but
a
certain
massive
simplicity
and
absence
of
usage
in
the
ways
of
the
world
is
all
on
the
trooper
side
well
he
proceeds
throwing
off
his
disappointment
next
and
last
those
plans
of
mine
you
have
been
so
brotherly
as
to
propose
to
me
to
fall
in
here
and
take
my
place
among
the
products
of
your
perseverance
and
sense
i
thank
you
heartily
it
more
than
brotherly
as
i
said
before
and
i
thank
you
heartily
for
it
shaking
him
a
long
time
by
the
hand
but
the
truth
is
brother
i
am
a
i
am
a
kind
of
a
weed
and
it
too
late
to
plant
me
in
a
regular
garden
my
dear
george
returns
the
elder
concentrating
his
strong
steady
brow
upon
him
and
smiling
confidently
leave
that
to
me
and
let
me
try
george
shakes
his
head
you
could
do
it
i
have
not
a
doubt
if
anybody
could
but
it
not
to
be
done
not
to
be
done
sir
whereas
it
so
falls
out
on
the
other
hand
that
i
am
able
to
be
of
some
trifle
of
use
to
sir
leicester
dedlock
since
his
illness
brought
on
by
family
sorrows
and
that
he
would
rather
have
that
help
from
our
mother
son
than
from
anybody
else
well
my
dear
george
returns
the
other
with
a
very
slight
shade
upon
his
open
face
if
you
prefer
to
serve
in
sir
leicester
dedlock
household
brigade
there
it
is
brother
cries
the
trooper
checking
him
with
his
hand
upon
his
knee
again
there
it
is
you
do
take
kindly
to
that
idea
i
do
mind
it
you
are
not
used
to
being
officered
i
am
everything
about
you
is
in
perfect
order
and
discipline
everything
about
me
requires
to
be
kept
so
we
are
not
accustomed
to
carry
things
with
the
same
hand
or
to
look
at
from
the
same
point
i
do
say
much
about
my
garrison
manners
because
i
found
myself
pretty
well
at
my
ease
last
night
and
they
would
be
noticed
here
i
dare
say
once
and
away
but
i
shall
get
on
best
at
chesney
wold
where
there
more
room
for
a
weed
than
there
is
here
and
the
dear
old
lady
will
be
made
happy
besides
therefore
i
accept
of
sir
leicester
dedlock
proposals
when
i
come
over
next
year
to
give
away
the
bride
or
whenever
i
come
i
shall
have
the
sense
to
keep
the
household
brigade
in
ambuscade
and
not
to
manoeuvre
it
on
your
ground
i
thank
you
heartily
again
and
am
proud
to
think
of
the
rouncewells
as
they
be
founded
by
you
you
know
yourself
george
says
the
elder
brother
returning
the
grip
of
his
hand
and
perhaps
you
know
me
better
than
i
know
myself
take
your
way
so
that
we
do
quite
lose
one
another
again
take
your
way
no
fear
of
that
returns
the
trooper
now
before
i
turn
my
horse
head
homewards
brother
i
will
ask
you
if
you
be
so
good
to
look
over
a
letter
for
me
i
brought
it
with
me
to
send
from
these
parts
as
chesney
wold
might
be
a
painful
name
just
now
to
the
person
it
written
to
i
am
not
much
accustomed
to
correspondence
myself
and
i
am
particular
respecting
this
present
letter
because
i
want
it
to
be
both
straightforward
and
delicate
herewith
he
hands
a
letter
closely
written
in
somewhat
pale
ink
but
in
a
neat
round
hand
to
the
ironmaster
who
reads
as
follows
miss
esther
summerson
a
communication
having
been
made
to
me
by
inspector
bucket
of
a
letter
to
myself
being
found
among
the
papers
of
a
certain
person
i
take
the
liberty
to
make
known
to
you
that
it
was
but
a
few
lines
of
instruction
from
abroad
when
where
and
how
to
deliver
an
enclosed
letter
to
a
young
and
beautiful
lady
then
unmarried
in
england
i
duly
observed
the
same
i
further
take
the
liberty
to
make
known
to
you
that
it
was
got
from
me
as
a
proof
of
handwriting
only
and
that
otherwise
i
would
not
have
given
it
up
as
appearing
to
be
the
most
harmless
in
my
possession
without
being
previously
shot
through
the
heart
i
further
take
the
liberty
to
mention
that
if
i
could
have
supposed
a
certain
unfortunate
gentleman
to
have
been
in
existence
i
never
could
and
never
would
have
rested
until
i
had
discovered
his
retreat
and
shared
my
last
farthing
with
him
as
my
duty
and
my
inclination
would
have
equally
been
but
he
was
officially
reported
drowned
and
assuredly
went
over
the
side
of
a
at
night
in
an
irish
harbour
within
a
few
hours
of
her
arrival
from
the
west
indies
as
i
have
myself
heard
both
from
officers
and
men
on
board
and
know
to
have
been
officially
confirmed
i
further
take
the
liberty
to
state
that
in
my
humble
quality
as
one
of
the
rank
and
file
i
am
and
shall
ever
continue
to
be
your
thoroughly
devoted
and
admiring
servant
and
that
i
esteem
the
qualities
you
possess
above
all
others
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
present
dispatch
i
have
the
honour
to
be
george
a
little
formal
observes
the
elder
brother
refolding
it
with
a
puzzled
face
but
nothing
that
might
not
be
sent
to
a
pattern
young
lady
asks
the
younger
nothing
at
all
therefore
it
is
sealed
and
deposited
for
posting
among
the
iron
correspondence
of
the
day
this
done
george
takes
a
hearty
farewell
of
the
family
party
and
prepares
to
saddle
and
mount
his
brother
however
unwilling
to
part
with
him
so
soon
proposes
to
ride
with
him
in
a
light
open
carriage
to
the
place
where
he
will
bait
for
the
night
and
there
remain
with
him
until
morning
a
servant
riding
for
so
much
of
the
journey
on
the
thoroughbred
old
grey
from
chesney
wold
the
offer
being
gladly
accepted
is
followed
by
a
pleasant
ride
a
pleasant
dinner
and
a
pleasant
breakfast
all
in
brotherly
communion
then
they
once
more
shake
hands
long
and
heartily
and
part
the
ironmaster
turning
his
face
to
the
smoke
and
fires
and
the
trooper
to
the
green
country
early
in
the
afternoon
the
subdued
sound
of
his
heavy
military
trot
is
heard
on
the
turf
in
the
avenue
as
he
rides
on
with
imaginary
clank
and
jingle
of
accoutrements
under
the
old
chapter
lxiv
esther
narrative
soon
after
i
had
that
conversation
with
my
guardian
he
put
a
sealed
paper
in
my
hand
one
morning
and
said
this
is
for
next
month
my
dear
i
found
in
it
two
hundred
pounds
i
now
began
very
quietly
to
make
such
preparations
as
i
thought
were
necessary
regulating
my
purchases
by
my
guardian
taste
which
i
knew
very
well
of
course
i
arranged
my
wardrobe
to
please
him
and
hoped
i
should
be
highly
successful
i
did
it
all
so
quietly
because
i
was
not
quite
free
from
my
old
apprehension
that
ada
would
be
rather
sorry
and
because
my
guardian
was
so
quiet
himself
i
had
no
doubt
that
under
all
the
circumstances
we
should
be
married
in
the
most
private
and
simple
manner
perhaps
i
should
only
have
to
say
to
ada
would
you
like
to
come
and
see
me
married
my
pet
perhaps
our
wedding
might
even
be
as
unpretending
as
her
own
and
i
might
not
find
it
necessary
to
say
anything
about
it
until
it
was
over
i
thought
that
if
i
were
to
choose
i
would
like
this
best
the
only
exception
i
made
was
woodcourt
i
told
her
that
i
was
going
to
be
married
to
my
guardian
and
that
we
had
been
engaged
some
time
she
highly
approved
she
could
never
do
enough
for
me
and
was
remarkably
softened
now
in
comparison
with
what
she
had
been
when
we
first
knew
her
there
was
no
trouble
she
would
not
have
taken
to
have
been
of
use
to
me
but
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
only
allowed
her
to
take
as
little
as
gratified
her
kindness
without
tasking
it
of
course
this
was
not
a
time
to
neglect
my
guardian
and
of
course
it
was
not
a
time
for
neglecting
my
darling
so
i
had
plenty
of
occupation
which
i
was
glad
of
and
as
to
charley
she
was
absolutely
not
to
be
seen
for
needlework
to
surround
herself
with
great
heaps
of
it
baskets
full
and
tables
full
and
do
a
little
and
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
in
staring
with
her
round
eyes
at
what
there
was
to
do
and
persuade
herself
that
she
was
going
to
do
it
were
charley
great
dignities
and
delights
meanwhile
i
must
say
i
could
not
agree
with
my
guardian
on
the
subject
of
the
will
and
i
had
some
sanguine
hopes
of
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
which
of
us
was
right
will
soon
appear
but
i
certainly
did
encourage
expectations
in
richard
the
discovery
gave
occasion
for
a
burst
of
business
and
agitation
that
buoyed
him
up
for
a
little
time
but
he
had
lost
the
elasticity
even
of
hope
now
and
seemed
to
me
to
retain
only
its
feverish
anxieties
from
something
my
guardian
said
one
day
when
we
were
talking
about
this
i
understood
that
my
marriage
would
not
take
place
until
after
the
we
had
been
told
to
look
forward
to
and
i
thought
the
more
for
that
how
rejoiced
i
should
be
if
i
could
be
married
when
richard
and
ada
were
a
little
more
prosperous
the
term
was
very
near
indeed
when
my
guardian
was
called
out
of
town
and
went
down
into
yorkshire
on
woodcourt
business
he
had
told
me
beforehand
that
his
presence
there
would
be
necessary
i
had
just
come
in
one
night
from
my
dear
girl
and
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
all
my
new
clothes
looking
at
them
all
around
me
and
thinking
when
a
letter
from
my
guardian
was
brought
to
me
it
asked
me
to
join
him
in
the
country
and
mentioned
by
what
my
place
was
taken
and
at
what
time
in
the
morning
i
should
have
to
leave
town
it
added
in
a
postscript
that
i
would
not
be
many
hours
from
ada
i
expected
few
things
less
than
a
journey
at
that
time
but
i
was
ready
for
it
in
half
an
hour
and
set
off
as
appointed
early
next
morning
i
travelled
all
day
wondering
all
day
what
i
could
be
wanted
for
at
such
a
distance
now
i
thought
it
might
be
for
this
purpose
and
now
i
thought
it
might
be
for
that
purpose
but
i
was
never
never
never
near
the
truth
it
was
night
when
i
came
to
my
journey
end
and
found
my
guardian
waiting
for
me
this
was
a
great
relief
for
towards
evening
i
had
begun
to
fear
the
more
so
as
his
letter
was
a
very
short
one
that
he
might
be
ill
however
there
he
was
as
well
as
it
was
possible
to
be
and
when
i
saw
his
genial
face
again
at
its
brightest
and
best
i
said
to
myself
he
has
been
doing
some
other
great
kindness
not
that
it
required
much
penetration
to
say
that
because
i
knew
that
his
being
there
at
all
was
an
act
of
kindness
supper
was
ready
at
the
hotel
and
when
we
were
alone
at
table
he
said
full
of
curiosity
no
doubt
little
woman
to
know
why
i
have
brought
you
here
well
guardian
said
i
without
thinking
myself
a
fatima
or
you
a
blue
beard
i
am
a
little
curious
about
it
then
to
ensure
your
night
rest
my
love
he
returned
gaily
i
wo
wait
until
to
tell
you
i
have
very
much
wished
to
express
to
woodcourt
somehow
my
sense
of
his
humanity
to
poor
unfortunate
jo
his
inestimable
services
to
my
young
cousins
and
his
value
to
us
all
when
it
was
decided
that
he
should
settle
here
it
came
into
my
head
that
i
might
ask
his
acceptance
of
some
unpretending
and
suitable
little
place
to
lay
his
own
head
in
i
therefore
caused
such
a
place
to
be
looked
out
for
and
such
a
place
was
found
on
very
easy
terms
and
i
have
been
touching
it
up
for
him
and
making
it
habitable
however
when
i
walked
over
it
the
day
before
yesterday
and
it
was
reported
ready
i
found
that
i
was
not
housekeeper
enough
to
know
whether
things
were
all
as
they
ought
to
be
so
i
sent
off
for
the
best
little
housekeeper
that
could
possibly
be
got
to
come
and
give
me
her
advice
and
opinion
and
here
she
is
said
my
guardian
laughing
and
crying
both
together
because
he
was
so
dear
so
good
so
admirable
i
tried
to
tell
him
what
i
thought
of
him
but
i
could
not
articulate
a
word
tut
tut
said
my
guardian
you
make
too
much
of
it
little
woman
why
how
you
sob
dame
durden
how
you
sob
it
is
with
exquisite
pleasure
guardian
with
a
heart
full
of
thanks
well
well
said
he
i
am
delighted
that
you
approve
i
thought
you
would
i
meant
it
as
a
pleasant
surprise
for
the
little
mistress
of
bleak
house
i
kissed
him
and
dried
my
eyes
i
know
now
said
i
i
have
seen
this
in
your
face
a
long
while
no
have
you
really
my
dear
said
he
what
a
dame
durden
it
is
to
read
a
face
he
was
so
quaintly
cheerful
that
i
could
not
long
be
otherwise
and
was
almost
ashamed
of
having
been
otherwise
at
all
when
i
went
to
bed
i
cried
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
i
cried
but
i
hope
it
was
with
pleasure
though
i
am
not
quite
sure
it
was
with
pleasure
i
repeated
every
word
of
the
letter
twice
over
a
most
beautiful
summer
morning
succeeded
and
after
breakfast
we
went
out
arm
in
arm
to
see
the
house
of
which
i
was
to
give
my
mighty
housekeeping
opinion
we
entered
a
by
a
gate
in
a
side
wall
of
which
he
had
the
key
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
that
the
beds
and
flowers
were
all
laid
out
according
to
the
manner
of
my
beds
and
flowers
at
home
you
see
my
dear
observed
my
guardian
standing
still
with
a
delighted
face
to
watch
my
looks
knowing
there
could
be
no
better
plan
i
borrowed
yours
we
went
on
by
a
pretty
little
orchard
where
the
cherries
were
nestling
among
the
green
leaves
and
the
shadows
of
the
were
sporting
on
the
grass
to
the
house
itself
a
cottage
quite
a
rustic
cottage
of
doll
rooms
but
such
a
lovely
place
so
tranquil
and
so
beautiful
with
such
a
rich
and
smiling
country
spread
around
it
with
water
sparkling
away
into
the
distance
here
all
overhung
with
there
turning
a
humming
mill
at
its
nearest
point
glancing
through
a
meadow
by
the
cheerful
town
where
were
assembling
in
bright
groups
and
a
flag
was
flying
from
a
white
tent
that
rippled
in
the
sweet
west
wind
and
still
as
we
went
through
the
pretty
rooms
out
at
the
little
rustic
verandah
doors
and
underneath
the
tiny
wooden
colonnades
garlanded
with
woodbine
jasmine
and
i
saw
in
the
papering
on
the
walls
in
the
colours
of
the
furniture
in
the
arrangement
of
all
the
pretty
objects
my
little
tastes
and
fancies
my
little
methods
and
inventions
which
they
used
to
laugh
at
while
they
praised
them
my
odd
ways
everywhere
i
could
not
say
enough
in
admiration
of
what
was
all
so
beautiful
but
one
secret
doubt
arose
in
my
mind
when
i
saw
this
i
thought
oh
would
he
be
the
happier
for
it
would
it
not
have
been
better
for
his
peace
that
i
should
not
have
been
so
brought
before
him
because
although
i
was
not
what
he
thought
me
still
he
loved
me
very
dearly
and
it
might
remind
him
mournfully
of
what
be
believed
he
had
lost
i
did
not
wish
him
to
forget
me
perhaps
he
might
not
have
done
so
without
these
aids
to
his
memory
but
my
way
was
easier
than
his
and
i
could
have
reconciled
myself
even
to
that
so
that
he
had
been
the
happier
for
it
and
now
little
woman
said
my
guardian
whom
i
had
never
seen
so
proud
and
joyful
as
in
showing
me
these
things
and
watching
my
appreciation
of
them
now
last
of
all
for
the
name
of
this
house
what
is
it
called
dear
guardian
my
child
said
he
come
and
see
he
took
me
to
the
porch
which
he
had
hitherto
avoided
and
said
pausing
before
we
went
out
my
dear
child
do
you
guess
the
name
no
said
i
we
went
out
of
the
porch
and
he
showed
me
written
over
it
bleak
house
he
led
me
to
a
seat
among
the
leaves
close
by
and
sitting
down
beside
me
and
taking
my
hand
in
his
spoke
to
me
thus
my
darling
girl
in
what
there
has
been
between
us
i
have
i
hope
been
really
solicitous
for
your
happiness
when
i
wrote
you
the
letter
to
which
you
brought
the
answer
smiling
as
he
referred
to
it
i
had
my
own
too
much
in
view
but
i
had
yours
too
whether
under
different
circumstances
i
might
ever
have
renewed
the
old
dream
i
sometimes
dreamed
when
you
were
very
young
of
making
you
my
wife
one
day
i
need
not
ask
myself
i
did
renew
it
and
i
wrote
my
letter
and
you
brought
your
answer
you
are
following
what
i
say
my
child
i
was
cold
and
i
trembled
violently
but
not
a
word
he
uttered
was
lost
as
i
sat
looking
fixedly
at
him
and
the
sun
rays
descended
softly
shining
through
the
leaves
upon
his
bare
head
i
felt
as
if
the
brightness
on
him
must
be
like
the
brightness
of
the
angels
hear
me
my
love
but
do
not
speak
it
is
for
me
to
speak
now
when
it
was
that
i
began
to
doubt
whether
what
i
had
done
would
really
make
you
happy
is
no
matter
woodcourt
came
home
and
i
soon
had
no
doubt
at
all
i
clasped
him
round
the
neck
and
hung
my
head
upon
his
breast
and
wept
lie
lightly
confidently
here
my
child
said
he
pressing
me
gently
to
him
i
am
your
guardian
and
your
father
now
rest
confidently
here
soothingly
like
the
gentle
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
genially
like
the
ripening
weather
and
radiantly
and
beneficently
like
the
sunshine
he
went
on
understand
me
my
dear
girl
i
had
no
doubt
of
your
being
contented
and
happy
with
me
being
so
dutiful
and
so
devoted
but
i
saw
with
whom
you
would
be
happier
that
i
penetrated
his
secret
when
dame
durden
was
blind
to
it
is
no
wonder
for
i
knew
the
good
that
could
never
change
in
her
better
far
than
she
did
well
i
have
long
been
in
allan
woodcourt
confidence
although
he
was
not
until
yesterday
a
few
hours
before
you
came
here
in
mine
but
i
would
not
have
my
esther
bright
example
lost
i
would
not
have
a
jot
of
my
dear
girl
virtues
unobserved
and
unhonoured
i
would
not
have
her
admitted
on
sufferance
into
the
line
of
morgan
no
not
for
the
weight
in
gold
of
all
the
mountains
in
wales
he
stopped
to
kiss
me
on
the
forehead
and
i
sobbed
and
wept
afresh
for
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
bear
the
painful
delight
of
his
praise
hush
little
woman
do
cry
this
is
to
be
a
day
of
joy
i
have
looked
forward
to
it
he
said
exultingly
for
months
on
months
a
few
words
more
dame
trot
and
i
have
said
my
say
determined
not
to
throw
away
one
atom
of
my
esther
worth
i
took
woodcourt
into
a
separate
confidence
madam
said
i
clearly
perceive
and
indeed
i
know
to
boot
that
your
son
loves
my
ward
i
am
further
very
sure
that
my
ward
loves
your
son
but
will
sacrifice
her
love
to
a
sense
of
duty
and
affection
and
will
sacrifice
it
so
completely
so
entirely
so
religiously
that
you
should
never
suspect
it
though
you
watched
her
night
and
day
then
i
told
her
all
our
story
ours
yours
and
mine
madam
said
i
you
knowing
this
and
live
with
us
come
you
and
see
my
child
from
hour
to
hour
set
what
you
see
against
her
pedigree
which
is
this
and
this
for
i
scorned
to
mince
it
tell
me
what
is
the
true
legitimacy
when
you
shall
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
on
that
subject
why
honour
to
her
old
welsh
blood
my
dear
cried
my
guardian
with
enthusiasm
i
believe
the
heart
it
animates
beats
no
less
warmly
no
less
admiringly
no
less
lovingly
towards
dame
durden
than
my
own
he
tenderly
raised
my
head
and
as
i
clung
to
him
kissed
me
in
his
old
fatherly
way
again
and
again
what
a
light
now
on
the
protecting
manner
i
had
thought
about
one
more
last
word
when
allan
woodcourt
spoke
to
you
my
dear
he
spoke
with
my
knowledge
and
consent
but
i
gave
him
no
encouragement
not
i
for
these
surprises
were
my
great
reward
and
i
was
too
miserly
to
part
with
a
scrap
of
it
he
was
to
come
and
tell
me
all
that
passed
and
he
did
i
have
no
more
to
say
my
dearest
allan
woodcourt
stood
beside
your
father
when
he
lay
dead
stood
beside
your
mother
this
is
bleak
house
this
day
i
give
this
house
its
little
mistress
and
before
god
it
is
the
brightest
day
in
all
my
life
he
rose
and
raised
me
with
him
we
were
no
longer
alone
my
husband
i
have
called
him
by
that
name
full
seven
happy
years
now
stood
at
my
side
allan
said
my
guardian
take
from
me
a
willing
gift
the
best
wife
that
ever
man
had
what
more
can
i
say
for
you
than
that
i
know
you
deserve
her
take
with
her
the
little
home
she
brings
you
you
know
what
she
will
make
it
allan
you
know
what
she
has
made
its
namesake
let
me
share
its
felicity
sometimes
and
what
do
i
sacrifice
nothing
nothing
he
kissed
me
once
again
and
now
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
more
softly
esther
my
dearest
after
so
many
years
there
is
a
kind
of
parting
in
this
too
i
know
that
my
mistake
has
caused
you
some
distress
forgive
your
old
guardian
in
restoring
him
to
his
old
place
in
your
affections
and
blot
it
out
of
your
memory
allan
take
my
dear
he
moved
away
from
under
the
green
roof
of
leaves
and
stopping
in
the
sunlight
outside
and
turning
cheerfully
towards
us
said
i
shall
be
found
about
here
somewhere
it
a
west
wind
little
woman
due
west
let
no
one
thank
me
any
more
for
i
am
going
to
revert
to
my
bachelor
habits
and
if
anybody
disregards
this
warning
i
run
away
and
never
come
back
what
happiness
was
ours
that
day
what
joy
what
rest
what
hope
what
gratitude
what
bliss
we
were
to
be
married
before
the
month
was
out
but
when
we
were
to
come
and
take
possession
of
our
own
house
was
to
depend
on
richard
and
ada
we
all
three
went
home
together
next
day
as
soon
as
we
arrived
in
town
allan
went
straight
to
see
richard
and
to
carry
our
joyful
news
to
him
and
my
darling
late
as
it
was
i
meant
to
go
to
her
for
a
few
minutes
before
lying
down
to
sleep
but
i
went
home
with
my
guardian
first
to
make
his
tea
for
him
and
to
occupy
the
old
chair
by
his
side
for
i
did
not
like
to
think
of
its
being
empty
so
soon
when
we
came
home
we
found
that
a
young
man
had
called
three
times
in
the
course
of
that
one
day
to
see
me
and
that
having
been
told
on
the
occasion
of
his
third
call
that
i
was
not
expected
to
return
before
ten
at
night
he
had
left
word
that
he
would
call
about
then
he
had
left
his
card
three
times
guppy
as
i
naturally
speculated
on
the
object
of
these
visits
and
as
i
always
associated
something
ludicrous
with
the
visitor
it
fell
out
that
in
laughing
about
guppy
i
told
my
guardian
of
his
old
proposal
and
his
subsequent
retraction
after
that
said
my
guardian
we
will
certainly
receive
this
hero
so
instructions
were
given
that
guppy
should
be
shown
in
when
he
came
again
and
they
were
scarcely
given
when
he
did
come
again
he
was
embarrassed
when
he
found
my
guardian
with
me
but
recovered
himself
and
said
how
de
do
sir
how
do
you
do
sir
returned
my
guardian
thank
you
sir
i
am
tolerable
returned
guppy
will
you
allow
me
to
introduce
my
mother
guppy
of
the
old
street
road
and
my
particular
friend
weevle
that
is
to
say
my
friend
has
gone
by
the
name
of
weevle
but
his
name
is
really
and
truly
jobling
my
guardian
begged
them
to
be
seated
and
they
all
sat
down
tony
said
guppy
to
his
friend
after
an
awkward
silence
will
you
open
the
case
do
it
yourself
returned
the
friend
rather
tartly
well
jarndyce
sir
guppy
after
a
moment
consideration
began
to
the
great
diversion
of
his
mother
which
she
displayed
by
nudging
jobling
with
her
elbow
and
winking
at
me
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
i
had
an
idea
that
i
should
see
miss
summerson
by
herself
and
was
not
quite
prepared
for
your
esteemed
presence
but
miss
summerson
has
mentioned
to
you
perhaps
that
something
has
passed
between
us
on
former
occasions
miss
summerson
returned
my
guardian
smiling
has
made
a
communication
to
that
effect
to
me
that
said
guppy
makes
matters
easier
sir
i
have
come
out
of
my
articles
at
kenge
and
carboy
and
i
believe
with
satisfaction
to
all
parties
i
am
now
admitted
after
undergoing
an
examination
that
enough
to
badger
a
man
blue
touching
a
pack
of
nonsense
that
he
do
want
to
know
on
the
roll
of
attorneys
and
have
taken
out
my
certificate
if
it
would
be
any
satisfaction
to
you
to
see
it
thank
you
guppy
returned
my
guardian
i
am
quite
willing
i
believe
i
use
a
legal
phrase
to
admit
the
certificate
guppy
therefore
desisted
from
taking
something
out
of
his
pocket
and
proceeded
without
it
i
have
no
capital
myself
but
my
mother
has
a
little
property
which
takes
the
form
of
an
annuity
here
guppy
mother
rolled
her
head
as
if
she
never
could
sufficiently
enjoy
the
observation
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
and
again
winked
at
me
and
a
few
pounds
for
expenses
out
of
pocket
in
conducting
business
will
never
be
wanting
free
of
interest
which
is
an
advantage
you
know
said
guppy
feelingly
certainly
an
advantage
returned
my
guardian
i
have
some
connexion
pursued
guppy
and
it
lays
in
the
direction
of
walcot
square
lambeth
i
have
therefore
taken
a
in
that
locality
which
in
the
opinion
of
my
friends
is
a
hollow
bargain
taxes
ridiculous
and
use
of
fixtures
included
in
the
rent
and
intend
setting
up
professionally
for
myself
there
forthwith
here
guppy
mother
fell
into
an
extraordinary
passion
of
rolling
her
head
and
smiling
waggishly
at
anybody
who
would
look
at
her
it
a
exclusive
of
kitchens
said
guppy
and
in
the
opinion
of
my
friends
a
commodious
tenement
when
i
mention
my
friends
i
refer
principally
to
my
friend
jobling
who
i
believe
has
known
me
guppy
looked
at
him
with
a
sentimental
air
from
boyhood
hour
jobling
confirmed
this
with
a
sliding
movement
of
his
legs
my
friend
jobling
will
render
me
his
assistance
in
the
capacity
of
clerk
and
will
live
in
the
said
guppy
my
mother
will
likewise
live
in
the
when
her
present
quarter
in
the
old
street
road
shall
have
ceased
and
expired
and
consequently
there
will
be
no
want
of
society
my
friend
jobling
is
naturally
aristocratic
by
taste
and
besides
being
acquainted
with
the
movements
of
the
upper
circles
fully
backs
me
in
the
intentions
i
am
now
developing
jobling
said
certainly
and
withdrew
a
little
from
the
elbow
of
mr
guppy
mother
now
i
have
no
occasion
to
mention
to
you
sir
you
being
in
the
confidence
of
miss
summerson
said
guppy
mother
i
wish
be
so
good
as
to
keep
still
that
miss
summerson
image
was
formerly
imprinted
on
my
and
that
i
made
her
a
proposal
of
marriage
that
i
have
heard
returned
my
guardian
circumstances
pursued
guppy
over
which
i
had
no
control
but
quite
the
contrary
weakened
the
impression
of
that
image
for
a
time
at
which
time
miss
summerson
conduct
was
highly
genteel
i
may
even
add
magnanimous
my
guardian
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
and
seemed
much
amused
now
sir
said
guppy
i
have
got
into
that
state
of
mind
myself
that
i
wish
for
a
reciprocity
of
magnanimous
behaviour
i
wish
to
prove
to
miss
summerson
that
i
can
rise
to
a
heighth
of
which
perhaps
she
hardly
thought
me
capable
i
find
that
the
image
which
i
did
suppose
had
been
eradicated
from
my
is
not
eradicated
its
influence
over
me
is
still
tremenjous
and
yielding
to
it
i
am
willing
to
overlook
the
circumstances
over
which
none
of
us
have
had
any
control
and
to
renew
those
proposals
to
miss
summerson
which
i
had
the
honour
to
make
at
a
former
period
i
beg
to
lay
the
in
walcot
square
the
business
and
myself
before
miss
summerson
for
her
acceptance
very
magnanimous
indeed
sir
observed
my
guardian
well
sir
replied
guppy
with
candour
my
wish
is
to
be
magnanimous
i
do
not
consider
that
in
making
this
offer
to
miss
summerson
i
am
by
any
means
throwing
myself
away
neither
is
that
the
opinion
of
my
friends
still
there
are
circumstances
which
i
submit
may
be
taken
into
account
as
a
set
off
against
any
little
drawbacks
of
mine
and
so
a
fair
and
equitable
balance
arrived
at
i
take
upon
myself
sir
said
my
guardian
laughing
as
he
rang
the
bell
to
reply
to
your
proposals
on
behalf
of
miss
summerson
she
is
very
sensible
of
your
handsome
intentions
and
wishes
you
good
evening
and
wishes
you
well
oh
said
guppy
with
a
blank
look
is
that
tantamount
sir
to
acceptance
or
rejection
or
consideration
to
decided
rejection
if
you
please
returned
my
guardian
guppy
looked
incredulously
at
his
friend
and
at
his
mother
who
suddenly
turned
very
angry
and
at
the
floor
and
at
the
ceiling
indeed
said
he
then
jobling
if
you
was
the
friend
you
represent
yourself
i
should
think
you
might
hand
my
mother
out
of
the
gangway
instead
of
allowing
her
to
remain
where
she
wanted
but
guppy
positively
refused
to
come
out
of
the
gangway
she
would
hear
of
it
why
get
along
with
you
said
she
to
my
guardian
what
do
you
mean
ai
my
son
good
enough
for
you
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
get
out
with
you
my
good
lady
returned
my
guardian
it
is
hardly
reasonable
to
ask
me
to
get
out
of
my
own
room
i
do
care
for
that
said
guppy
get
out
with
you
if
we
ai
good
enough
for
you
go
and
procure
somebody
that
is
good
enough
go
along
and
find
i
was
quite
unprepared
for
the
rapid
manner
in
which
power
of
jocularity
merged
into
a
power
of
taking
the
profoundest
offence
go
along
and
find
somebody
that
good
enough
for
you
repeated
guppy
get
out
nothing
seemed
to
astonish
guppy
mother
so
much
and
to
make
her
so
very
indignant
as
our
not
getting
out
why
do
you
get
out
said
guppy
what
are
you
stopping
here
for
mother
interposed
her
son
always
getting
before
her
and
pushing
her
back
with
one
shoulder
as
she
sidled
at
my
guardian
will
you
hold
your
tongue
no
william
she
returned
i
wo
not
unless
he
gets
out
i
wo
however
guppy
and
jobling
together
closed
on
mother
who
began
to
be
quite
abusive
and
took
her
very
much
against
her
will
downstairs
her
voice
rising
a
stair
higher
every
time
her
figure
got
a
stair
lower
and
insisting
that
we
should
immediately
go
and
find
somebody
who
was
good
enough
for
us
and
above
all
things
that
we
should
get
out
chapter
lxv
beginning
the
world
the
term
had
commenced
and
my
guardian
found
an
intimation
from
kenge
that
the
cause
would
come
on
in
two
days
as
i
had
sufficient
hopes
of
the
will
to
be
in
a
flutter
about
it
allan
and
i
agreed
to
go
down
to
the
court
that
morning
richard
was
extremely
agitated
and
was
so
weak
and
low
though
his
illness
was
still
of
the
mind
that
my
dear
girl
indeed
had
sore
occasion
to
be
supported
but
she
looked
forward
a
very
little
way
now
to
the
help
that
was
to
come
to
her
and
never
drooped
it
was
at
westminster
that
the
cause
was
to
come
on
it
had
come
on
there
i
dare
say
a
hundred
times
before
but
i
could
not
divest
myself
of
an
idea
that
it
might
lead
to
some
result
now
we
left
home
directly
after
breakfast
to
be
at
westminster
hall
in
good
time
and
walked
down
there
through
the
lively
streets
so
happily
and
strangely
it
seemed
together
as
we
were
going
along
planning
what
we
should
do
for
richard
and
ada
i
heard
somebody
calling
esther
my
dear
esther
esther
and
there
was
caddy
jellyby
with
her
head
out
of
the
window
of
a
little
carriage
which
she
hired
now
to
go
about
in
to
her
pupils
she
had
so
many
as
if
she
wanted
to
embrace
me
at
a
hundred
yards
distance
i
had
written
her
a
note
to
tell
her
of
all
that
my
guardian
had
done
but
had
not
had
a
moment
to
go
and
see
her
of
course
we
turned
back
and
the
affectionate
girl
was
in
that
state
of
rapture
and
was
so
overjoyed
to
talk
about
the
night
when
she
brought
me
the
flowers
and
was
so
determined
to
squeeze
my
face
bonnet
and
all
between
her
hands
and
go
on
in
a
wild
manner
altogether
calling
me
all
kinds
of
precious
names
and
telling
allan
i
had
done
i
do
know
what
for
her
that
i
was
just
obliged
to
get
into
the
little
carriage
and
calm
her
down
by
letting
her
say
and
do
exactly
what
she
liked
allan
standing
at
the
window
was
as
pleased
as
caddy
and
i
was
as
pleased
as
either
of
them
and
i
wonder
that
i
got
away
as
i
did
rather
than
that
i
came
off
laughing
and
red
and
anything
but
tidy
and
looking
after
caddy
who
looked
after
us
out
of
the
as
long
as
she
could
see
us
this
made
us
some
quarter
of
an
hour
late
and
when
we
came
to
westminster
hall
we
found
that
the
day
business
was
begun
worse
than
that
we
found
such
an
unusual
crowd
in
the
court
of
chancery
that
it
was
full
to
the
door
and
we
could
neither
see
nor
hear
what
was
passing
within
it
appeared
to
be
something
droll
for
occasionally
there
was
a
laugh
and
a
cry
of
silence
it
appeared
to
be
something
interesting
for
every
one
was
pushing
and
striving
to
get
nearer
it
appeared
to
be
something
that
made
the
professional
gentlemen
very
merry
for
there
were
several
young
counsellors
in
wigs
and
whiskers
on
the
outside
of
the
crowd
and
when
one
of
them
told
the
others
about
it
they
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
quite
doubled
themselves
up
with
laughter
and
went
stamping
about
the
pavement
of
the
hall
we
asked
a
gentleman
by
us
if
he
knew
what
cause
was
on
he
told
us
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
we
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
was
doing
in
it
he
said
really
no
he
did
not
nobody
ever
did
but
as
well
as
he
could
make
out
it
was
over
over
for
the
day
we
asked
him
no
he
said
over
for
good
over
for
good
when
we
heard
this
unaccountable
answer
we
looked
at
one
another
quite
lost
in
amazement
could
it
be
possible
that
the
will
had
set
things
right
at
last
and
that
richard
and
ada
were
going
to
be
rich
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
alas
it
was
our
suspense
was
short
for
a
soon
took
place
in
the
crowd
and
the
people
came
streaming
out
looking
flushed
and
hot
and
bringing
a
quantity
of
bad
air
with
them
still
they
were
all
exceedingly
amused
and
were
more
like
people
coming
out
from
a
farce
or
a
juggler
than
from
a
court
of
justice
we
stood
aside
watching
for
any
countenance
we
knew
and
presently
great
bundles
of
paper
began
to
be
carried
out
bundles
in
bags
bundles
too
large
to
be
got
into
any
bags
immense
masses
of
papers
of
all
shapes
and
no
shapes
which
the
bearers
staggered
under
and
threw
down
for
the
time
being
anyhow
on
the
hall
pavement
while
they
went
back
to
bring
out
more
even
these
clerks
were
laughing
we
glanced
at
the
papers
and
seeing
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
everywhere
asked
an
person
who
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
them
whether
the
cause
was
over
yes
he
said
it
was
all
up
with
it
at
last
and
burst
out
laughing
too
at
this
juncture
we
perceived
kenge
coming
out
of
court
with
an
affable
dignity
upon
him
listening
to
vholes
who
was
deferential
and
carried
his
own
bag
vholes
was
the
first
to
see
us
here
is
miss
summerson
sir
he
said
and
mr
woodcourt
oh
indeed
yes
truly
said
kenge
raising
his
hat
to
me
with
polished
politeness
how
do
you
do
glad
to
see
you
jarndyce
is
not
here
no
he
never
came
there
i
reminded
him
really
returned
kenge
it
is
as
well
that
he
is
not
here
for
his
shall
i
say
in
my
good
friend
absence
his
indomitable
singularity
of
opinion
might
have
been
strengthened
perhaps
not
reasonably
but
might
have
been
strengthened
pray
what
has
been
done
asked
allan
i
beg
your
pardon
said
kenge
with
excessive
urbanity
what
has
been
done
what
has
been
done
repeated
kenge
quite
so
yes
why
not
much
has
been
done
not
much
we
have
been
checked
brought
up
suddenly
i
would
say
upon
the
shall
i
term
it
threshold
is
this
will
considered
a
genuine
document
sir
said
allan
will
you
tell
us
that
most
certainly
if
i
could
said
kenge
but
we
have
not
gone
into
that
we
have
not
gone
into
that
we
have
not
gone
into
that
repeated
vholes
as
if
his
low
inward
voice
were
an
echo
you
are
to
reflect
woodcourt
observed
kenge
using
his
silver
trowel
persuasively
and
smoothingly
that
this
has
been
a
great
cause
that
this
has
been
a
protracted
cause
that
this
has
been
a
complex
cause
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
has
been
termed
not
inaptly
a
monument
of
chancery
practice
and
patience
has
sat
upon
it
a
long
time
said
allan
very
well
indeed
sir
returned
kenge
with
a
certain
condescending
laugh
he
had
very
well
you
are
further
to
reflect
woodcourt
becoming
dignified
almost
to
severity
that
on
the
numerous
difficulties
contingencies
masterly
fictions
and
forms
of
procedure
in
this
great
cause
there
has
been
expended
study
ability
eloquence
knowledge
intellect
woodcourt
high
intellect
for
many
years
the
a
i
would
say
the
flower
of
the
bar
and
the
a
i
would
presume
to
add
the
matured
autumnal
fruits
of
the
woolsack
have
been
lavished
upon
jarndyce
and
jarndyce
if
the
public
have
the
benefit
and
if
the
country
have
the
adornment
of
this
great

it
must
be
paid
for

money
or
money
worth
sir
kenge
said
allan
appearing
enlightened
all
in
a
moment
excuse
me
our
time
presses
do
i
understand
that
the
whole
estate
is
found
to
have
been
absorbed
in
costs
hem
i
believe
so
returned
kenge
vholes
what
do
you
say
i
believe
so
said
vholes
and
that
thus
the
suit
lapses
and
melts
away
probably
returned
kenge
mr
vholes
probably
said
vholes
my
dearest
life
whispered
allan
this
will
break
heart
there
was
such
a
shock
of
apprehension
in
his
face
and
he
knew
richard
so
perfectly
and
i
too
had
seen
so
much
of
his
gradual
decay
that
what
my
dear
girl
had
said
to
me
in
the
fullness
of
her
foreboding
love
sounded
like
a
knell
in
my
ears
in
case
you
should
be
wanting
sir
said
vholes
coming
after
us
you
find
him
in
court
i
left
him
there
resting
himself
a
little
good
day
sir
good
day
miss
summerson
as
he
gave
me
that
slowly
devouring
look
of
his
while
twisting
up
the
strings
of
his
bag
before
he
hastened
with
it
after
kenge
the
benignant
shadow
of
whose
conversational
presence
he
seemed
afraid
to
leave
he
gave
one
gasp
as
if
he
had
swallowed
the
last
morsel
of
his
client
and
his
black
unwholesome
figure
glided
away
to
the
low
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
my
dear
love
said
allan
leave
to
me
for
a
little
while
the
charge
you
gave
me
go
home
with
this
intelligence
and
come
to
by
and
by
i
would
not
let
him
take
me
to
a
coach
but
entreated
him
to
go
to
richard
without
a
moment
delay
and
leave
me
to
do
as
he
wished
hurrying
home
i
found
my
guardian
and
told
him
gradually
with
what
news
i
had
returned
little
woman
said
he
quite
unmoved
for
himself
to
have
done
with
the
suit
on
any
terms
is
a
greater
blessing
than
i
had
looked
for
but
my
poor
young
cousins
we
talked
about
them
all
the
morning
and
discussed
what
it
was
possible
to
do
in
the
afternoon
my
guardian
walked
with
me
to
symond
inn
and
left
me
at
the
door
i
went
upstairs
when
my
darling
heard
my
footsteps
she
came
out
into
the
small
passage
and
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
but
she
composed
herself
directly
and
said
that
richard
had
asked
for
me
several
times
allan
had
found
him
sitting
in
the
corner
of
the
court
she
told
me
like
a
stone
figure
on
being
roused
he
had
broken
away
and
made
as
if
he
would
have
spoken
in
a
fierce
voice
to
the
judge
he
was
stopped
by
his
mouth
being
full
of
blood
and
allan
had
brought
him
home
he
was
lying
on
a
sofa
with
his
eyes
closed
when
i
went
in
there
were
restoratives
on
the
table
the
room
was
made
as
airy
as
possible
and
was
darkened
and
was
very
orderly
and
quiet
allan
stood
behind
him
watching
him
gravely
his
face
appeared
to
me
to
be
quite
destitute
of
colour
and
now
that
i
saw
him
without
his
seeing
me
i
fully
saw
for
the
first
time
how
worn
away
he
was
but
he
looked
handsomer
than
i
had
seen
him
look
for
many
a
day
i
sat
down
by
his
side
in
silence
opening
his
eyes
by
and
by
he
said
in
a
weak
voice
but
with
his
old
smile
dame
durden
kiss
me
my
dear
it
was
a
great
comfort
and
surprise
to
me
to
find
him
in
his
low
state
cheerful
and
looking
forward
he
was
happier
he
said
in
our
intended
marriage
than
he
could
find
words
to
tell
me
my
husband
had
been
a
guardian
angel
to
him
and
ada
and
he
blessed
us
both
and
wished
us
all
the
joy
that
life
could
yield
us
i
almost
felt
as
if
my
own
heart
would
have
broken
when
i
saw
him
take
my
husband
hand
and
hold
it
to
his
breast
we
spoke
of
the
future
as
much
as
possible
and
he
said
several
times
that
he
must
be
present
at
our
marriage
if
he
could
stand
upon
his
feet
ada
would
contrive
to
take
him
somehow
he
said
yes
surely
dearest
richard
but
as
my
darling
answered
him
thus
hopefully
so
serene
and
beautiful
with
the
help
that
was
to
come
to
her
so
near
i
knew
i
knew
it
was
not
good
for
him
to
talk
too
much
and
when
he
was
silent
we
were
silent
too
sitting
beside
him
i
made
a
pretence
of
working
for
my
dear
as
he
had
always
been
used
to
joke
about
my
being
busy
ada
leaned
upon
his
pillow
holding
his
head
upon
her
arm
he
dozed
often
and
whenever
he
awoke
without
seeing
him
said
first
of
all
where
is
woodcourt
evening
had
come
on
when
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
and
saw
my
guardian
standing
in
the
little
hall
who
is
that
dame
durden
richard
asked
me
the
door
was
behind
him
but
he
had
observed
in
my
face
that
some
one
was
there
i
looked
to
allan
for
advice
and
as
he
nodded
yes
bent
over
richard
and
told
him
my
guardian
saw
what
passed
came
softly
by
me
in
a
moment
and
laid
his
hand
on
richard
oh
sir
said
richard
you
are
a
good
man
you
are
a
good
man
and
burst
into
tears
for
the
first
time
my
guardian
the
picture
of
a
good
man
sat
down
in
my
place
keeping
his
hand
on
richard
my
dear
rick
said
he
the
clouds
have
cleared
away
and
it
is
bright
now
we
can
see
now
we
were
all
bewildered
rick
more
or
less
what
matters
and
how
are
you
my
dear
boy
i
am
very
weak
sir
but
i
hope
i
shall
be
stronger
i
have
to
begin
the
world
aye
truly
well
said
cried
my
guardian
i
will
not
begin
it
in
the
old
way
now
said
richard
with
a
sad
smile
i
have
learned
a
lesson
now
sir
it
was
a
hard
one
but
you
shall
be
assured
indeed
that
i
have
learned
it
well
well
said
my
guardian
comforting
him
well
well
well
dear
boy
i
was
thinking
sir
resumed
richard
that
there
is
nothing
on
earth
i
should
so
much
like
to
see
as
their
house
dame
durden
and
woodcourt
house
if
i
could
be
removed
there
when
i
begin
to
recover
my
strength
i
feel
as
if
i
should
get
well
there
sooner
than
anywhere
why
so
have
i
been
thinking
too
rick
said
my
guardian
and
our
little
woman
likewise
she
and
i
have
been
talking
of
it
this
very
day
i
dare
say
her
husband
wo
object
what
do
you
think
richard
smiled
and
lifted
up
his
arm
to
touch
him
as
he
stood
behind
the
head
of
the
couch
i
say
nothing
of
ada
said
richard
but
i
think
of
her
and
have
thought
of
her
very
much
look
at
her
see
her
here
sir
bending
over
this
pillow
when
she
has
so
much
need
to
rest
upon
it
herself
my
dear
love
my
poor
girl
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
none
of
us
spoke
he
gradually
released
her
and
she
looked
upon
us
and
looked
up
to
heaven
and
moved
her
lips
when
i
get
down
to
bleak
house
said
richard
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
you
sir
and
you
will
have
much
to
show
me
you
will
go
you
undoubtedly
dear
rick
thank
you
like
you
like
you
said
richard
but
it
all
like
you
they
have
been
telling
me
how
you
planned
it
and
how
you
remembered
all
esther
familiar
tastes
and
ways
it
will
be
like
coming
to
the
old
bleak
house
again
and
you
will
come
there
too
i
hope
rick
i
am
a
solitary
man
now
you
know
and
it
will
be
a
charity
to
come
to
me
a
charity
to
come
to
me
my
love
he
repeated
to
ada
as
he
gently
passed
his
hand
over
her
golden
hair
and
put
a
lock
of
it
to
his
lips
i
think
he
vowed
within
himself
to
cherish
her
if
she
were
left
alone
it
was
a
troubled
dream
said
richard
clasping
both
my
hands
eagerly
nothing
more
rick
nothing
more
and
you
being
a
good
man
can
pass
it
as
such
and
forgive
and
pity
the
dreamer
and
be
lenient
and
encouraging
when
he
wakes
indeed
i
can
what
am
i
but
another
dreamer
rick
i
will
begin
the
world
said
richard
with
a
light
in
his
eyes
my
husband
drew
a
little
nearer
towards
ada
and
i
saw
him
solemnly
lift
up
his
hand
to
warn
my
guardian
when
shall
i
go
from
this
place
to
that
pleasant
country
where
the
old
times
are
where
i
shall
have
strength
to
tell
what
ada
has
been
to
me
where
i
shall
be
able
to
recall
my
many
faults
and
blindnesses
where
i
shall
prepare
myself
to
be
a
guide
to
my
unborn
child
said
richard
when
shall
i
go
dear
rick
when
you
are
strong
enough
returned
my
guardian
ada
my
darling
he
sought
to
raise
himself
a
little
allan
raised
him
so
that
she
could
hold
him
on
her
bosom
which
was
what
he
wanted
i
have
done
you
many
wrongs
my
own
i
have
fallen
like
a
poor
stray
shadow
on
your
way
i
have
married
you
to
poverty
and
trouble
i
have
scattered
your
means
to
the
winds
you
will
forgive
me
all
this
my
ada
before
i
begin
the
world
a
smile
irradiated
his
face
as
she
bent
to
kiss
him
he
slowly
laid
his
face
down
upon
her
bosom
drew
his
arms
closer
round
her
neck
and
with
one
parting
sob
began
the
world
not
this
world
oh
not
this
the
world
that
sets
this
right
when
all
was
still
at
a
late
hour
poor
crazed
miss
flite
came
weeping
to
me
and
told
me
she
had
given
her
birds
their
liberty
chapter
lxvi
down
in
lincolnshire
there
is
a
hush
upon
chesney
wold
in
these
altered
days
as
there
is
upon
a
portion
of
the
family
history
the
story
goes
that
sir
leicester
paid
some
who
could
have
spoken
out
to
hold
their
peace
but
it
is
a
lame
story
feebly
whispering
and
creeping
about
and
any
brighter
spark
of
life
it
shows
soon
dies
away
it
is
known
for
certain
that
the
handsome
lady
dedlock
lies
in
the
mausoleum
in
the
park
where
the
trees
arch
darkly
overhead
and
the
owl
is
heard
at
night
making
the
woods
ring
but
whence
she
was
brought
home
to
be
laid
among
the
echoes
of
that
solitary
place
or
how
she
died
is
all
mystery
some
of
her
old
friends
principally
to
be
found
among
the
charmers
with
the
skeleton
throats
did
once
occasionally
say
as
they
toyed
in
a
ghastly
manner
with
large
fans
like
charmers
reduced
to
flirting
with
grim
death
after
losing
all
their
other
beaux
did
once
occasionally
say
when
the
world
assembled
together
that
they
wondered
the
ashes
of
the
dedlocks
entombed
in
the
mausoleum
never
rose
against
the
profanation
of
her
company
but
the
dedlocks
take
it
very
calmly
and
have
never
been
known
to
object
up
from
among
the
fern
in
the
hollow
and
winding
by
the
among
the
trees
comes
sometimes
to
this
lonely
spot
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
then
may
be
seen
sir
leicester
invalided
bent
and
almost
blind
but
of
worthy
presence
yet
riding
with
a
stalwart
man
beside
him
constant
to
his
when
they
come
to
a
certain
spot
before
the
sir
leicester
accustomed
horse
stops
of
his
own
accord
and
sir
leicester
pulling
off
his
hat
is
still
for
a
few
moments
before
they
ride
away
war
rages
yet
with
the
audacious
boythorn
though
at
uncertain
intervals
and
now
hotly
and
now
coolly
flickering
like
an
unsteady
fire
the
truth
is
said
to
be
that
when
sir
leicester
came
down
to
lincolnshire
for
good
boythorn
showed
a
manifest
desire
to
abandon
his
right
of
way
and
do
whatever
sir
leicester
would
which
sir
leicester
conceiving
to
be
a
condescension
to
his
illness
or
misfortune
took
in
such
high
dudgeon
and
was
so
magnificently
aggrieved
by
that
boythorn
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
committing
a
flagrant
trespass
to
restore
his
neighbour
to
himself
similarly
boythorn
continues
to
post
tremendous
placards
on
the
disputed
thoroughfare
and
with
his
bird
upon
his
head
to
hold
forth
vehemently
against
sir
leicester
in
the
sanctuary
of
his
own
home
similarly
also
he
defies
him
as
of
old
in
the
little
church
by
testifying
a
bland
unconsciousness
of
his
existence
but
it
is
whispered
that
when
he
is
most
ferocious
towards
his
old
foe
he
is
really
most
considerate
and
that
sir
leicester
in
the
dignity
of
being
implacable
little
supposes
how
much
he
is
humoured
as
little
does
he
think
how
near
together
he
and
his
antagonist
have
suffered
in
the
fortunes
of
two
sisters
and
his
antagonist
who
knows
it
now
is
not
the
man
to
tell
him
so
the
quarrel
goes
on
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
in
one
of
the
lodges
of
the
park
that
lodge
within
sight
of
the
house
where
once
upon
a
time
when
the
waters
were
out
down
in
lincolnshire
my
lady
used
to
see
the
keeper
child
the
stalwart
man
the
trooper
formerly
is
housed
some
relics
of
his
old
calling
hang
upon
the
walls
and
these
it
is
the
chosen
recreation
of
a
little
lame
man
about
the
to
keep
gleaming
bright
a
busy
little
man
he
always
is
in
the
polishing
at
doors
of
bits
harness
bosses
anything
in
the
way
of
a
that
will
take
a
polish
leading
a
life
of
friction
a
shaggy
little
damaged
man
withal
not
unlike
an
old
dog
of
some
mongrel
breed
who
has
been
considerably
knocked
about
he
answers
to
the
name
of
phil
a
goodly
sight
it
is
to
see
the
grand
old
housekeeper
harder
of
hearing
now
going
to
church
on
the
arm
of
her
son
and
to
observe
which
few
do
for
the
house
is
scant
of
company
in
these
times
the
relations
of
both
towards
sir
leicester
and
his
towards
them
they
have
visitors
in
the
high
summer
weather
when
a
grey
cloak
and
umbrella
unknown
to
chesney
wold
at
other
periods
are
seen
among
the
leaves
when
two
young
ladies
are
occasionally
found
gambolling
in
sequestered
and
such
nooks
of
the
park
and
when
the
smoke
of
two
pipes
wreathes
away
into
the
fragrant
evening
air
from
the
trooper
door
then
is
a
fife
heard
trolling
within
the
lodge
on
the
inspiring
topic
of
the
british
grenadiers
and
as
the
evening
closes
in
a
gruff
inflexible
voice
is
heard
to
say
while
two
men
pace
together
up
and
down
but
i
never
own
to
it
before
the
old
girl
discipline
must
be
maintained
the
greater
part
of
the
house
is
shut
up
and
it
is
a
no
longer
yet
sir
leicester
holds
his
shrunken
state
in
the
long
for
all
that
and
reposes
in
his
old
place
before
my
lady
picture
closed
in
by
night
with
broad
screens
and
illumined
only
in
that
part
the
light
of
the
seems
gradually
contracting
and
dwindling
until
it
shall
be
no
more
a
little
more
in
truth
and
it
will
be
all
extinguished
for
sir
leicester
and
the
damp
door
in
the
mausoleum
which
shuts
so
tight
and
looks
so
obdurate
will
have
opened
and
received
him
volumnia
growing
with
the
flight
of
time
pinker
as
to
the
red
in
her
face
and
yellower
as
to
the
white
reads
to
sir
leicester
in
the
long
evenings
and
is
driven
to
various
artifices
to
conceal
her
yawns
of
which
the
chief
and
most
efficacious
is
the
insertion
of
the
pearl
necklace
between
her
rosy
lips
treatises
on
the
buffy
and
boodle
question
showing
how
buffy
is
immaculate
and
boodle
villainous
and
how
the
country
is
lost
by
being
all
boodle
and
no
buffy
or
saved
by
being
all
buffy
and
no
boodle
it
must
be
one
of
the
two
and
can
not
be
anything
else
are
the
staple
of
her
reading
sir
leicester
is
not
particular
what
it
is
and
does
not
appear
to
follow
it
very
closely
further
than
that
he
always
comes
broad
awake
the
moment
volumnia
ventures
to
leave
off
and
sonorously
repeating
her
last
words
begs
with
some
displeasure
to
know
if
she
finds
herself
fatigued
however
volumnia
in
the
course
of
her
hopping
about
and
pecking
at
papers
has
alighted
on
a
memorandum
concerning
herself
in
the
event
of
anything
happening
to
her
kinsman
which
is
handsome
compensation
for
an
extensive
course
of
reading
and
holds
even
the
dragon
boredom
at
bay
the
cousins
generally
are
rather
shy
of
chesney
wold
in
its
dullness
but
take
to
it
a
little
in
the
shooting
season
when
guns
are
heard
in
the
plantations
and
a
few
scattered
beaters
and
keepers
wait
at
the
old
places
of
appointment
for
twos
and
threes
of
cousins
the
debilitated
cousin
more
debilitated
by
the
dreariness
of
the
place
gets
into
a
fearful
state
of
depression
groaning
under
penitential
in
his
gunless
hours
and
protesting
that
such
fernal
old
jail
nough
fler
up
frever
the
only
great
occasions
for
volumnia
in
this
changed
aspect
of
the
place
in
lincolnshire
are
those
occasions
rare
and
widely
separated
when
something
is
to
be
done
for
the
county
or
the
country
in
the
way
of
gracing
a
public
ball
then
indeed
does
the
tuckered
sylph
come
out
in
fairy
form
and
proceed
with
joy
under
cousinly
escort
to
the
exhausted
old
fourteen
heavy
miles
off
which
during
three
hundred
and
days
and
nights
of
every
ordinary
year
is
a
kind
of
antipodean
full
of
old
chairs
and
tables
upside
down
then
indeed
does
she
captivate
all
hearts
by
her
condescension
by
her
girlish
vivacity
and
by
her
skipping
about
as
in
the
days
when
the
hideous
old
general
with
the
mouth
too
full
of
teeth
had
not
cut
one
of
them
at
two
guineas
each
then
does
she
twirl
and
twine
a
pastoral
nymph
of
good
family
through
the
mazes
of
the
dance
then
do
the
swains
appear
with
tea
with
lemonade
with
sandwiches
with
homage
then
is
she
kind
and
cruel
stately
and
unassuming
various
beautifully
wilful
then
is
there
a
singular
kind
of
parallel
between
her
and
the
little
glass
chandeliers
of
another
age
embellishing
that
which
with
their
meagre
stems
their
spare
little
drops
their
disappointing
knobs
where
no
drops
are
their
bare
little
stalks
from
which
knobs
and
drops
have
both
departed
and
their
little
feeble
prismatic
twinkling
all
seem
volumnias
for
the
rest
lincolnshire
life
to
volumnia
is
a
vast
blank
of
overgrown
house
looking
out
upon
trees
sighing
wringing
their
hands
bowing
their
heads
and
casting
their
tears
upon
the
in
monotonous
depressions
a
labyrinth
of
grandeur
less
the
property
of
an
old
family
of
human
beings
and
their
ghostly
likenesses
than
of
an
old
family
of
echoings
and
thunderings
which
start
out
of
their
hundred
graves
at
every
sound
and
go
resounding
through
the
building
a
waste
of
unused
passages
and
staircases
in
which
to
drop
a
comb
upon
a
bedroom
floor
at
night
is
to
send
a
stealthy
footfall
on
an
errand
through
the
house
a
place
where
few
people
care
to
go
about
alone
where
a
maid
screams
if
an
ash
drops
from
the
fire
takes
to
crying
at
all
times
and
seasons
becomes
the
victim
of
a
low
disorder
of
the
spirits
and
gives
warning
and
departs
thus
chesney
wold
with
so
much
of
itself
abandoned
to
darkness
and
vacancy
with
so
little
change
under
the
summer
shining
or
the
wintry
lowering
so
sombre
and
motionless
always
no
flag
flying
now
by
day
no
rows
of
lights
sparkling
by
night
with
no
family
to
come
and
go
no
visitors
to
be
the
souls
of
pale
cold
shapes
of
rooms
no
stir
of
life
about
it
passion
and
pride
even
to
the
stranger
eye
have
died
away
from
the
place
in
lincolnshire
and
yielded
it

dull
repose
chapter
lxvii
the
close
of
esther
narrative
full
seven
happy
years
i
have
been
the
mistress
of
bleak
house
the
few
words
that
i
have
to
add
to
what
i
have
written
are
soon
penned
then
i
and
the
unknown
friend
to
whom
i
write
will
part
for
ever
not
without
much
dear
remembrance
on
my
side
not
without
some
i
hope
on
his
or
hers
they
gave
my
darling
into
my
arms
and
through
many
weeks
i
never
left
her
the
little
child
who
was
to
have
done
so
much
was
born
before
the
turf
was
planted
on
its
father
grave
it
was
a
boy
and
i
my
husband
and
my
guardian
gave
him
his
father
name
the
help
that
my
dear
counted
on
did
come
to
her
though
it
came
in
the
eternal
wisdom
for
another
purpose
though
to
bless
and
restore
his
mother
not
his
father
was
the
errand
of
this
baby
its
power
was
mighty
to
do
it
when
i
saw
the
strength
of
the
weak
little
hand
and
how
its
touch
could
heal
my
darling
heart
and
raised
hope
within
her
i
felt
a
new
sense
of
the
goodness
and
the
tenderness
of
god
they
throve
and
by
degrees
i
saw
my
dear
girl
pass
into
my
country
garden
and
walk
there
with
her
infant
in
her
arms
i
was
married
then
i
was
the
happiest
of
the
happy
it
was
at
this
time
that
my
guardian
joined
us
and
asked
ada
when
she
would
come
home
both
houses
are
your
home
my
dear
said
he
but
the
older
bleak
house
claims
priority
when
you
and
my
boy
are
strong
enough
to
do
it
come
and
take
possession
of
your
home
ada
called
him
her
dearest
cousin
john
but
he
said
no
it
must
be
guardian
now
he
was
her
guardian
henceforth
and
the
boy
and
he
had
an
old
association
with
the
name
so
she
called
him
guardian
and
has
called
him
guardian
ever
since
the
children
know
him
by
no
other
name
i
say
the
children
i
have
two
little
daughters
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
charley
still
and
not
at
all
grammatical
is
married
to
a
miller
in
our
neighbourhood
yet
so
it
is
and
even
now
looking
up
from
my
desk
as
i
write
early
in
the
morning
at
my
summer
window
i
see
the
very
mill
beginning
to
go
round
i
hope
the
miller
will
not
spoil
charley
but
he
is
very
fond
of
her
and
charley
is
rather
vain
of
such
a
match
for
he
is
well
to
do
and
was
in
great
request
so
far
as
my
small
maid
is
concerned
i
might
suppose
time
to
have
stood
for
seven
years
as
still
as
the
mill
did
half
an
hour
ago
since
little
emma
charley
sister
is
exactly
what
charley
used
to
be
as
to
tom
charley
brother
i
am
really
afraid
to
say
what
he
did
at
school
in
ciphering
but
i
think
it
was
decimals
he
is
apprenticed
to
the
miller
whatever
it
was
and
is
a
good
bashful
fellow
always
falling
in
love
with
somebody
and
being
ashamed
of
it
caddy
jellyby
passed
her
very
last
holidays
with
us
and
was
a
dearer
creature
than
ever
perpetually
dancing
in
and
out
of
the
house
with
the
children
as
if
she
had
never
given
a
in
her
life
caddy
keeps
her
own
little
carriage
now
instead
of
hiring
one
and
lives
full
two
miles
further
westward
than
newman
street
she
works
very
hard
her
husband
an
excellent
one
being
lame
and
able
to
do
very
little
still
she
is
more
than
contented
and
does
all
she
has
to
do
with
all
her
heart
jellyby
spends
his
evenings
at
her
new
house
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
he
used
to
do
in
her
old
one
i
have
heard
that
jellyby
was
understood
to
suffer
great
mortification
from
her
daughter
ignoble
marriage
and
pursuits
but
i
hope
she
got
over
it
in
time
she
has
been
disappointed
in
which
turned
out
a
failure
in
consequence
of
the
king
of
borrioboola
wanting
to
sell
everybody
who
survived
the
climate
for
rum
but
she
has
taken
up
with
the
rights
of
women
to
sit
in
parliament
and
caddy
tells
me
it
is
a
mission
involving
more
correspondence
than
the
old
one
i
had
almost
forgotten
caddy
poor
little
girl
she
is
not
such
a
mite
now
but
she
is
deaf
and
dumb
i
believe
there
never
was
a
better
mother
than
caddy
who
learns
in
her
scanty
intervals
of
leisure
innumerable
deaf
and
dumb
arts
to
soften
the
affliction
of
her
child
as
if
i
were
never
to
have
done
with
caddy
i
am
reminded
here
of
peepy
and
old
turveydrop
peepy
is
in
the
custom
house
and
doing
extremely
well
old
turveydrop
very
apoplectic
still
exhibits
his
deportment
about
town
still
enjoys
himself
in
the
old
manner
is
still
believed
in
in
the
old
way
he
is
constant
in
his
patronage
of
peepy
and
is
understood
to
have
bequeathed
him
a
favourite
french
clock
in
his
which
is
not
his
property
with
the
first
money
we
saved
at
home
we
added
to
our
pretty
house
by
throwing
out
a
little
growlery
expressly
for
my
guardian
which
we
inaugurated
with
great
splendour
the
next
time
he
came
down
to
see
us
i
try
to
write
all
this
lightly
because
my
heart
is
full
in
drawing
to
an
end
but
when
i
write
of
him
my
tears
will
have
their
way
i
never
look
at
him
but
i
hear
our
poor
dear
richard
calling
him
a
good
man
to
ada
and
her
pretty
boy
he
is
the
fondest
father
to
me
he
is
what
he
has
ever
been
and
what
name
can
i
give
to
that
he
is
my
husband
best
and
dearest
friend
he
is
our
children
darling
he
is
the
object
of
our
deepest
love
and
veneration
yet
while
i
feel
towards
him
as
if
he
were
a
superior
being
i
am
so
familiar
with
him
and
so
easy
with
him
that
i
almost
wonder
at
myself
i
have
never
lost
my
old
names
nor
has
he
lost
his
nor
do
i
ever
when
he
is
with
us
sit
in
any
other
place
than
in
my
old
chair
at
his
side
dame
trot
dame
durden
little
woman
all
just
the
same
as
ever
and
i
answer
yes
dear
guardian
just
the
same
i
have
never
known
the
wind
to
be
in
the
east
for
a
single
moment
since
the
day
when
he
took
me
to
the
porch
to
read
the
name
i
remarked
to
him
once
that
the
wind
seemed
never
in
the
east
now
and
he
said
no
truly
it
had
finally
departed
from
that
quarter
on
that
very
day
i
think
my
darling
girl
is
more
beautiful
than
ever
the
sorrow
that
has
been
in
her
face
for
it
is
not
there
now
seems
to
have
purified
even
its
innocent
expression
and
to
have
given
it
a
diviner
quality
sometimes
when
i
raise
my
eyes
and
see
her
in
the
black
dress
that
she
still
wears
teaching
my
richard
i
feel
it
is
difficult
to
express
as
if
it
were
so
good
to
know
that
she
remembers
her
dear
esther
in
her
prayers
i
call
him
my
richard
but
he
says
that
he
has
two
mamas
and
i
am
one
we
are
not
rich
in
the
bank
but
we
have
always
prospered
and
we
have
quite
enough
i
never
walk
out
with
my
husband
but
i
hear
the
people
bless
him
i
never
go
into
a
house
of
any
degree
but
i
hear
his
praises
or
see
them
in
grateful
eyes
i
never
lie
down
at
night
but
i
know
that
in
the
course
of
that
day
he
has
alleviated
pain
and
soothed
some
in
the
time
of
need
i
know
that
from
the
beds
of
those
who
were
past
recovery
thanks
have
often
often
gone
up
in
the
last
hour
for
his
patient
ministration
is
not
this
to
be
rich
the
people
even
praise
me
as
the
doctor
wife
the
people
even
like
me
as
i
go
about
and
make
so
much
of
me
that
i
am
quite
abashed
i
owe
it
all
to
him
my
love
my
pride
they
like
me
for
his
sake
as
i
do
everything
i
do
in
life
for
his
sake
a
night
or
two
ago
after
bustling
about
preparing
for
my
darling
and
my
guardian
and
little
richard
who
are
coming
i
was
sitting
out
in
the
porch
of
all
places
that
dearly
memorable
porch
when
allan
came
home
so
he
said
my
precious
little
woman
what
are
you
doing
here
and
i
said
the
moon
is
shining
so
brightly
allan
and
the
night
is
so
delicious
that
i
have
been
sitting
here
thinking
what
have
you
been
thinking
about
my
dear
said
allan
then
how
curious
you
are
said
i
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
but
i
will
i
have
been
thinking
about
my
old
looks
such
as
they
were
and
what
have
you
been
thinking
about
them
my
busy
bee
said
allan
i
have
been
thinking
that
i
thought
it
was
impossible
that
you
could
have
loved
me
any
better
even
if
i
had
retained
them
as
they
were
said
allan
laughing
such
as
they
were
of
course
my
dear
dame
durden
said
allan
drawing
my
arm
through
his
do
you
ever
look
in
the
glass
you
know
i
do
you
see
me
do
it
and
do
you
know
that
you
are
prettier
than
you
ever
were
i
did
not
know
that
i
am
not
certain
that
i
know
it
now
but
i
know
that
my
dearest
little
pets
are
very
pretty
and
that
my
darling
is
very
beautiful
and
that
my
husband
is
very
handsome
and
that
my
guardian
has
the
brightest
and
most
benevolent
face
that
ever
was
seen
and
that
they
can
very
well
do
without
much
beauty
in
me
even
supposing
