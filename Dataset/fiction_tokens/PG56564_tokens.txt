a
girlish
head
running
over
with
curls
lifted
itself
from
the
long
orchard
grass
and
listened
the
slender
arched
black
brows
met
over
the
bright
dark
eyes
in
a
vexed
frown
the
woman
who
was
calling
jaquelina
in
that
loud
shrill
uncultivated
voice
stood
in
the
doorway
of
a
low
unpainted
prettily
situated
on
the
gentle
slope
of
a
green
hill
at
whose
foot
a
silvery
little
brook
ran
singing
past
beyond
it
was
a
strip
of
fertile
meadow
then
the
ground
took
a
sloping
rise
again
into
the
orchard
now
glowing
white
and
red
in
the
flush
of
its
blossoming
under
the
branches
of
a
apple
tree
a
girl
lay
at
length
in
the
emerald
grass
and
blossoming
clover
her
curly
head
bent
over
a
book
the
sunshine
sifted
down
through
the
fragrant
boughs
on
the
soft
chestnut
locks
with
a
glint
of
gold
in
their
brownness
and
on
the
arch
pretty
face
with
its
soft
skin
tanned
to
a
clear
brune
by
exposure
and
the
pouting
lips
that
were
tinted
with
the
vivid
scarlet
of
youth
and
bounding
vitality
came
the
loud
elongated
scream
again
jaquelina
meredith
sprang
up
so
impatiently
that
her
head
struck
against
a
branch
and
a
shower
of
the
fragrant
fluttered
down
into
the
folds
of
her
faded
print
dress
a
robin
that
had
been
singing
in
the
tree
broke
off
in
his
warble
and
stared
down
at
her
in
surprise
what
now
i
wonder
she
said
as
she
took
up
her
book
and
her
and
wended
her
way
to
the
house
hurry
up
will
you
now
lina
cried
the
woman
in
the
doorway
as
she
crossed
the
log
over
the
little
brook
you
must
come
in
the
house
and
tend
the
baby
while
i
hasten
the
dinner
a
bit
your
uncle
wants
to
go
over
to
the
grange
meeting
directly
jaquelina
went
into
the
clean
neat
and
took
the
cross
heavy
child
into
her
slender
young
arms
and
proceeded
to
walk
up
and
down
the
floor
with
it
the
only
method
she
knew
of
to
still
its
clamorous
cries
for
its
mother
had
gone
to
the
kitchen
to
hurry
the
noonday
meal
for
her
farmer
husband
her
uncle
and
the
hired
man
who
had
just
come
in
from
the
field
sat
at
the
window
discussing
the
country
news
in
general
the
gang
of
seems
to
be
getting
into
our
neighborhood
said
the
plowman
squire
stanley
fine
bay
mare
was
taken
from
the
stable
last
night
farmer
meredith
started
and
looked
anxious
is
it
possible
he
said
why
stanley
is
more
than
two
miles
from
here
who
knows
but
they
may
come
here
next
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
if
they
took
my
two
horses
now
and
the
plowing
not
half
done
dreadful
said
the
man
but
it
a
desperate
gang
little
care
if
the
plowing
be
done
or
not
but
they
do
say
as
how
the
thieves
do
meddle
with
poor
men
beasts
much
it
the
rich
farmers
as
has
fine
horses
and
such
that
they
go
for
i
suppose
they
do
find
a
ready
market
for
common
likely
not
said
meredith
well
i
wish
the
gang
could
be
smoked
out
of
the
country
or
caught
up
with
in
their
thieving
it
a
terrible
scourge
to
the
country
this
gang
there
a
large
reward
out
for
the
ringleader
said
the
hired
man
i
saw
the
posters
out
on
smith
fence
as
i
came
along
this
morning
two
hundred
dollars
for
his
apprehension
jaquelina
who
had
been
listening
gave
a
startled
cry
two
hundred
dollars
oh
my
i
wish
i
could
catch
the
wretch
two
hundred
dollars
would
give
me
a
whole
year
at
a
good
farmer
meredith
looked
round
in
surprise
something
in
the
unconscious
wistfulness
struck
him
oddly
he
said
what
put
that
foolish
idea
in
your
head
lina
have
you
larnt
enough
readin
and
writin
at
the
public
school
four
months
in
every
winter
no
indeed
uncle
charlie
and
lina
shook
her
head
so
decisively
that
the
short
soft
rings
of
hair
danced
coquettishly
with
the
movement
it
very
little
i
know
indeed
and
if
i
only
knew
how
to
catch
that
i
spend
every
cent
of
the
reward
in
getting
myself
a
good
education
you
more
learning
than
is
good
for
you
now
said
meredith
sharply
as
she
the
room
and
overheard
the
words
every
time
i
want
you
there
you
are
out
of
the
way
with
your
face
poked
into
a
book
and
me
slaving
my
life
away
all
the
time
is
the
baby
asleep
put
her
into
the
cradle
then
come
men
dinner
ready
the
mistress
of
the
house
bustled
out
jaquelina
put
the
heavy
child
out
of
her
tired
aching
arms
into
the
cradle
and
sat
down
to
rock
it
her
full
red
lips
were
quivering
her
dark
eyes
were
misty
with
tears
that
her
girlish
pride
would
not
suffer
to
fall
how
hard
and
unkind
aunt
meredith
is
she
said
to
herself
ah
if
only
papa
and
mamma
had
lived
how
different
my
life
would
have
been
i
wish
i
had
died
too
shall
i
go
on
forever
like
this
minding
the
baby
washing
the
dishes
bringing
the
cows
serving
as
for
aunt
meredith
ill
tempers
and
considered
a
burden
in
spite
of
all
i
can
do
to
help
i
wish
when
papa
died
he
had
left
me
to
the
at
once
miss
said
a
voice
at
the
window
and
she
looked
around
with
a
start
it
was
only
a
neighbor
a
ignorant
negro
lad
who
had
converted
her
odd
name
of
jaquelina
into
well
she
said
what
do
you
want
sambo
why
do
you
come
to
the
window
and
frighten
me
so
i
in
a
hurry
if
you
please
miss
jack
said
the
lad
is
your
uncle
at
home
yes
at
dinner
said
the
girl
master
sent
me
over
to
see
if
meredith
and
his
man
would
jine
a
party
to
hunt
the
said
sambo
squire
stanley
headin
it
his
stable
was
robbed
last
night
jaquelina
went
into
the
kitchen
with
her
message
and
meredith
came
out
himself
tell
your
master
i
be
going
over
to
the
grange
meeting
this
afternoon
and
i
stop
by
and
make
arrangements
to
join
them
in
the
hunt
he
said
he
finished
his
dinner
and
started
the
idea
of
the
so
inspired
the
plowman
that
he
begged
to
be
excused
from
working
the
balance
of
the
day
and
went
away
full
of
enthusiasm
to
join
the
gallant
band
of
pursuers
jaquelina
washed
the
dishes
and
while
meredith
sat
by
the
cradle
with
her
knitting
the
girl
took
her
book
and
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
to
read
half
an
hour
went
by
quietly
the
hum
of
the
bees
and
the
warble
of
the
birds
were
all
that
broke
the
silence
save
the
low
whisper
of
the
wind
as
it
sighed
among
the
trees
jaquelina
enjoyed
the
silence
thoroughly
every
moment
dreading
to
hear
the
fretful
wail
of
her
aunt
baby
and
to
be
summoned
to
tend
it
again
but
lifting
her
head
at
last
as
she
turned
a
page
she
saw
a
lady
crossing
the
narrow
that
spanned
the
brook
aunt
meredith
she
said
turning
her
head
toward
the
there
company
coming
meredith
whisked
off
her
kitchen
apron
slipped
a
white
ruffled
one
over
her
dark
print
dress
and
appeared
at
the
door
just
in
time
to
hear
a
musical
voice
saying
kindly
lina
ah
mrs
meredith
chapter
ii
the
was
violet
earle
a
girl
scarcely
older
than
jaquelina
but
taller
better
dressed
and
exquisitely
lovely
she
was
fair
as
a
lily
with
soft
languishing
blue
eyes
and
golden
curls
falling
in
beautiful
luxuriance
upon
her
graceful
shoulders
a
cool
tasteful
costume
of
blue
and
white
lawn
with
ribbons
fluttering
here
and
there
lent
an
artistic
grace
to
her
appearance
that
made
jaquelina
shrink
into
herself
upon
the
doorstep
feeling
dowdy
miserable
and
commonplace
by
the
contrast
jaquelina
knew
no
one
on
earth
whom
she
envied
so
much
as
this
fair
and
young
lady
the
petted
only
daughter
of
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
county
miss
earle
will
you
walk
into
the
inquired
meredith
a
little
flustered
by
the
lovely
young
visitor
appearance
she
led
the
way
to
the
little
where
the
baby
slumbered
peacefully
still
and
they
sat
down
jaquelina
with
her
slim
finger
between
the
pages
of
her
book
lina
i
have
come
to
invite
you
to
a
party
night
violet
said
graciously
jaquelina
brune
face
flushed
her
scarlet
lips
trembled
with
pleasure
my
brother
and
one
of
his
classmates
are
come
from
college
for
a
visit
and
mamma
is
going
to
give
us
a
party
will
you
come
lina
jaquelina
glanced
at
meredith
yes
if
aunt
meredith
will
permit
me
she
answered
frankly
of
course
she
will
violet
said
looking
at
the
hostess
who
frowned
slightly
as
she
said
almost
bruskly
lina
has
nothing
fit
to
wear
to
a
party
lina
sensitive
cheeks
turned
crimson
but
miss
earle
only
laughed
everyone
says
when
invited
to
a
party
she
observed
lightly
it
was
what
i
said
about
myself
when
mamma
first
named
the
party
this
morning
but
you
see
after
all
this
will
only
be
a
kind
of
impromptu
party
a
lawn
party
we
will
have
chinese
lanterns
and
colored
lamps
hung
in
the
trees
and
refreshments
served
out
of
doors
and
games
you
know
yes
said
lina
and
her
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
beamed
she
forgot
the
embarrassing
sense
of
dowdiness
that
often
overwhelmed
her
in
miss
earle
elegant
presence
and
sat
up
straight
and
forgot
to
draw
her
shabby
little
slippers
under
her
chair
there
was
a
great
deal
of
dainty
untutored
grace
in
the
slim
figure
and
violet
who
was
inclined
to
patronize
the
shy
orphan
girl
decided
to
herself
that
lina
meredith
would
be
rather
a
pretty
girl
if
only
she
were
not
so
tanned
and
if
only
her
uncle
and
aunt
would
dress
her
decently
i
have
invited
several
people
she
went
on
looking
at
meredith
and
they
all
said
they
would
be
sure
to
come
mamma
said
she
thought
you
would
be
very
glad
to
have
lina
come
as
she
sees
so
very
little
pleasure
miss
violet
fine
little
shaft
of
malice
told
meredith
face
turned
red
in
a
moment
she
could
not
but
be
aware
that
the
neighbors
gossiped
over
her
treatment
of
her
niece
and
said
that
she
kept
her
a
dowdy
and
a
drudge
lina
sees
as
much
pleasure
as
she
can
afford
to
see
she
retorted
a
little
shortly
she
was
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
her
mouth
like
some
people
she
has
to
work
for
her
living
the
same
as
i
do
as
for
the
party
i
obliged
to
your
mother
i
sure
for
inviting
jaquelina
i
not
a
word
to
say
against
her
going
but
she
nothing
but
calico
dresses
lina
glanced
at
miss
earle
pretty
lawn
and
the
deep
color
flushed
into
her
face
again
even
violet
looked
disconcerted
have
you
even
a
white
she
said
after
a
minute
almost
any
kind
of
a
white
would
look
well
at
a
at
night
you
know
you
can
wear
natural
flowers
jaquelina
looked
at
her
aunt
with
a
sudden
gleam
in
her
eyes
aunt
meredith
there
mamma
white
dress
in
the
chest
up
in
the
garret
her
you
know
she
said
and
yellow
as
gold
sniffed
meredith
contemptuously
the
very
thing
cried
violet
earle
is
the
rage
and
antique
styles
are
very
fashionable
wear
your
mother
by
all
means
lina
and
plenty
of
flowers
remember
it
wearing
the
clothes
of
them
that
dead
and
gone
said
meredith
oh
aunt
meredith
could
you
think
mamma
would
care
for
me
wearing
her
cried
jaquelina
reproachfully
certainly
not
said
violet
earle
could
an
angel
in
heaven
care
for
an
old
dress
she
had
left
upon
earth
what
do
garments
matter
to
one
wearing
the
robe
of
righteousness
wear
it
by
all
means
lina
she
rose
as
she
spoke
and
moved
toward
the
door
lina
meredith
lina
do
fail
us
we
have
only
invited
a
certain
number
of
girls
and
we
count
on
everyone
being
there
chapter
iii
miss
earle
went
away
jaquelina
brought
the
cows
from
the
pasture
and
tended
the
baby
while
her
aunt
did
the
milking
it
was
a
dull
and
prosaic
life
enough
for
a
young
girl
who
was
pretty
spirited
and
imaginative
no
wonder
her
thoughts
dwelt
eagerly
and
longingly
on
the
to
which
violet
earle
had
invited
her
the
girl
felt
as
if
she
were
going
to
have
a
peep
into
fairyland
she
thought
violet
earle
was
the
dearest
and
kindest
girl
in
the
world
she
did
not
know
how
violet
had
said
when
she
went
home
mamma
i
can
not
see
why
you
were
so
anxious
to
have
that
shy
awkward
jaquelina
meredith
come
to
our
party
she
has
not
a
decent
thing
to
wear
her
aunt
said
so
she
will
have
to
come
in
an
old
white
dress
that
belonged
to
her
mother
violet
brother
the
young
collegian
laughed
gentle
earle
looked
at
them
both
a
little
reproachfully
my
dears
i
wish
you
would
not
laugh
at
little
lina
poverty
she
said
the
merediths
do
not
treat
her
right
but
aside
from
her
poverty
she
ranks
as
high
in
the
social
scale
as
we
do
her
father
was
an
artist
of
no
mean
ability
he
would
have
made
his
mark
if
he
had
not
died
young
i
feel
sorry
for
little
jaquelina
was
her
mother
a
nice
person
too
mamma
violet
asked
interested
i
did
not
know
her
mother
very
well
said
earle
she
was
jaquelina
ardell
a
young
french
girl
whom
claude
meredith
married
while
he
was
abroad
she
did
not
live
but
a
few
months
after
they
returned
here
when
her
little
girl
was
born
she
died
and
meredith
soon
after
said
the
student
i
remember
it
myself
i
was
a
lad
of
five
years
at
the
time
yes
he
died
of
a
fever
said
earle
with
a
sigh
quickly
suppressed
did
he
leave
no
money
for
his
daughter
inquired
violet
no
he
spent
the
few
thousands
his
bequeathed
him
upon
his
education
and
his
abroad
so
lina
is
dependent
upon
her
uncle
charity
a
cold
charity
it
is
too
said
violet
thinking
of
cold
hard
meredith
charlie
meredith
is
not
purposely
unkind
earle
said
quickly
but
he
is
thoughtless
and
careless
and
his
wife
rules
him
still
for
the
sake
of
his
feelings
i
should
not
like
to
slight
daughter
i
do
hope
she
will
make
a
respectable
appearance
so
that
no
one
will
be
able
to
laugh
at
her
said
violet
it
was
on
my
mind
to
offer
to
lend
her
a
but
i
decided
that
she
would
not
have
accepted
it
i
am
glad
you
did
not
her
mother
said
promptly
i
think
lina
is
proud
in
her
way
she
would
have
been
hurt
violet
and
her
brother
thought
their
mamma
was
very
kind
and
thoughtful
over
jaquelina
meredith
no
one
had
ever
told
them
that
claude
meredith
and
their
mother
had
been
lovers
in
their
boy
and
girl
days
and
that
an
ambitious
father
had
come
between
them
and
persuaded
the
girl
into
a
loveless
union
with
the
wealthy
earle
jaquelina
herself
did
not
know
what
an
interest
the
pretty
faded
woman
took
in
her
fate
as
she
walked
up
and
down
the
low
with
her
little
cousin
in
her
arms
she
remembered
how
tenderly
violet
had
said
mamma
and
a
vague
yearning
stood
over
her
to
feel
herself
enfolded
in
the
sweetness
of
a
mother
love
which
she
poor
child
was
never
to
know
at
twilight
sambo
came
over
from
the
neighboring
farm
with
a
message
for
meredith
her
husband
had
joined
the
band
of
men
who
were
going
to
pursue
the
and
would
not
be
home
until
morning
if
she
and
jaquelina
were
afraid
they
were
to
take
the
child
and
go
to
a
neighbor
to
spend
the
night
meredith
laughed
at
the
idea
of
fear
so
did
jaquelina
both
felt
perfectly
safe
in
the
quiet
peaceful
little
they
sent
word
that
they
would
remain
at
home
at
eight
meredith
according
to
her
usual
custom
retired
to
bed
with
her
child
jaquelina
took
a
lamp
and
went
to
her
own
room
but
not
to
sleep
it
was
too
early
the
night
hours
were
golden
ones
to
her
then
she
was
free
to
read
or
study
as
she
liked
true
her
aunt
grumbled
over
the
useless
waste
of
a
light
but
her
uncle
charlie
was
wont
to
interfere
so
decidedly
on
that
point
that
the
orphan
girl
had
her
way
but
the
book
was
laid
on
the
shelf
of
the
little
and
the
girl
dragged
out
a
little
cedar
chest
from
under
the
bed
she
unlocked
it
and
took
out
the
dress
she
had
told
violet
she
would
wear
to
the
her
mother
jaquelina
shook
out
the
folds
of
the
dress
and
spread
it
out
on
the
bed
to
look
at
it
was
a
fine
soft
india
muslin
trimmed
with
a
good
deal
of
fine
pretty
lace
and
bows
of
satin
ribbon
all
of
which
had
turned
very
yellow
in
the
years
while
it
lay
folded
in
the
cedar
chest
it
was
made
in
a
quaint
pretty
style
too
but
jaquelina
looked
at
it
doubtfully
she
did
not
know
enough
of
dry
goods
to
know
that
the
garment
was
made
of
the
finest
materials
and
was
costly
as
well
as
pretty
she
thought
of
violet
crisp
fresh
costumes
and
the
limp
india
muslin
suffered
in
her
guileless
mind
by
the
contrast
she
actually
brought
out
her
sunday
calico
with
its
fine
pink
dots
and
two
frills
on
the
skirt
and
laid
it
beside
the
india
muslin
anxiously
comparing
them
the
calico
is
the
certainly
she
said
turning
her
pretty
head
sidewise
in
fashion
and
eyeing
the
dresses
thoughtfully
but
i
am
quite
sure
from
the
way
violet
looked
she
would
not
like
for
me
to
wear
mamma
dress
is
very
pretty
if
only
it
were
not
so
limp
i
should
not
dare
try
to
starch
it
though
i
might
make
it
look
worse
then
she
took
a
little
box
from
the
chest
and
opened
it
it
contained
her
dead
mother
little
store
of
jewelry
there
were
two
or
three
simple
rings
a
thin
gold
chain
with
a
locket
that
held
her
father
and
mother
pictures
she
fastened
the
chain
around
her
neck
and
slipped
one
of
the
rings
the
prettiest
one
on
her
finger
i
will
wear
these
to
the
she
said
to
herself
the
ring
is
very
nice
it
has
such
a
pretty
shining
stone
it
was
a
pretty
ring
as
she
said
but
jaquelina
brought
up
so
ignorantly
in
the
lonely
did
not
know
that
the
shining
little
stone
was
a
real
diamond
charlie
meredith
and
his
hard
wife
did
not
know
it
either
they
all
thought
it
was
a
bright
pretty
bit
of
glass
there
was
a
motto
cut
deeply
inside
the
ring
over
which
jaquelina
had
often
puzzled
sometimes
she
thought
she
would
ask
violet
earle
who
had
been
to
to
translate
it
for
her
then
she
desisted
from
shame
at
her
own
ignorance
it
was
in
her
mother
native
tongue
but
no
one
had
taught
the
artist
orphan
child
a
line
of
french
the
question
of
the
being
settled
jaquelina
put
away
the
india
muslin
and
the
jewelry
and
sat
down
by
the
window
leaning
her
curly
head
on
her
slim
brown
hand
while
she
gazed
out
into
the
night
with
her
dark
dreamy
eyes
everything
was
very
still
and
peaceful
the
full
moon
sailed
on
in
calm
majesty
through
the
purple
sky
the
distant
hills
were
clearly
outlined
in
the
brightness
and
nearer
home
a
faint
white
mist
curled
over
the
brook
and
the
perfume
of
the
lilacs
and
the
roses
in
the
garden
below
were
borne
sweetly
on
the
wandering
breeze
yet
after
all
there
was
something
weird
and
mysterious
in
the
blended
brightness
and
shadows
of
the
landscape
and
the
sensitive
mind
of
jaquelina
felt
it
so
she
shuddered
and
her
thoughts
flew
to
the
outlaw
band
said
to
be
lurking
in
the
neighborhood
and
riding
off
with
all
the
finest
horses
of
the
farmers
she
thought
of
the
pursuing
party
her
mind
pictured
vividly
the
conflict
that
would
ensue
when
the
robbers
and
their
pursuers
met
and
the
capture
of
the
daring
chief
whom
rumor
represented
as
brave
and
handsome
as
a
whoever
captures
the
chief
will
have
dollars
for
a
reward
the
girl
said
to
herself
wistfully
ah
if
i
only
had
two
hundred
dollars
i
would
go
to
one
whole
year
i
would
study
so
hard
all
the
time
that
i
would
learn
as
much
in
twelve
months
as
any
other
girl
would
in
then
i
would
not
stay
at
the
farm
any
more
i
would
go
away
and
earn
my
own
living
by
teaching
or
perhaps
i
might
paint
pretty
little
pictures
like
papa
did
and
sell
them
to
rich
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
be
happy
two
crystal
drops
welled
up
into
the
dark
eyes
and
splashed
down
upon
her
cheeks
she
brushed
them
off
impatiently
crying
am
i
like
a
great
baby
she
said
sharply
to
herself
what
good
will
that
do
will
crying
get
me
two
hundred
dollars
and
send
me
to
school
and
deliver
me
from
the
jurisdiction
of
aunt
meredith
and
her
cross
baby
oh
that
i
might
be
a
man
for
a
few
hours
i
would
sally
forth
and
capture
the
and
win
the
reward
her
thoughts
having
turned
in
this
direction
jaquelina
forgot
the
for
awhile
and
remained
lost
in
thought
wishing
over
and
over
that
she
might
capture
the
outlaw
chief
and
claim
the
coveted
reward
that
appeared
so
large
in
her
longing
eyes
at
last
wearied
by
the
duties
of
the
day
the
tired
head
drooped
upon
the
the
long
black
lashes
lay
upon
the
warm
pink
cheeks
jaquelina
slept
and
dreamed
she
had
captured
the
dreaded
outlaw
chief
and
bound
him
securely
with
a
garland
of
roses
laughing
at
her
ludicrous
dream
the
young
girl
woke
someone
was
shaking
her
roughly
by
the
arm
lina
meredith
for
shame
said
her
aunt
towering
above
her
angular
and
slim
in
a
striped
calico
sleeping
in
the
window
at
midnight
and
the
lamp
bright
too
willful
waste
makes
woful
want
but
i
not
scold
you
this
time
i
glad
you
up
and
dressed
you
must
fetch
the
doctor
from
town
jaquelina
rose
stretching
her
cramped
limbs
and
yawning
drearily
only
half
awake
meredith
grabbed
a
wet
towel
and
deliberately
mopped
her
face
with
it
there
now
i
got
you
awake
she
said
triumphantly
did
you
hear
what
i
said
lina
you
have
to
saddle
black
bess
and
fetch
the
doctor
from
town
baby
got
the
cramp
dreadful
bad
too
jaquelina
broad
awake
now
stared
in
dismay
at
meredith
why
aunt
she
cried
how
can
i
go
for
the
doctor
at
midnight
the
town
is
at
least
a
mile
and
a
half
from
here
only
a
mile
through
the
woods
answered
meredith
quickly
the
young
girl
shivered
come
come
i
never
knew
you
afraid
of
anything
meredith
began
quickly
surely
you
do
this
much
for
me
lina
if
not
for
me
for
your
poor
little
cousin
dollie
her
life
away
and
none
to
bring
a
doctor
but
jaquelina
hesitated
aunt
meredith
she
said
the
road
through
the
woods
is
very
dark
and
lonely
and
you
may
see
for
yourself
the
moon
is
going
down
and
then
those
dreadful
outlaws
may
be
lurking
in
the
woods
is
dollie
so
very
bad
perhaps
she
would
do
until
daylight
come
said
meredith
pulling
the
girl
by
the
sleeve
you
shall
see
jaquelina
followed
her
down
stairs
to
the
room
where
the
fat
baby
lay
upon
the
bed
wheezing
terribly
while
now
and
then
a
hoarse
whistling
cough
echoed
painfully
through
the
room
jaquelina
heart
always
tender
to
pain
was
touched
by
the
sight
of
the
infant
suffering
oh
lina
will
you
let
the
darling
die
cried
the
frightened
mother
whose
hard
heart
could
soften
at
least
to
her
own
child
suffering
surely
you
bring
the
doctor
to
little
dollie
ca
i
go
over
to
brown
and
send
sambo
asked
the
girl
still
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
the
lonely
midnight
ride
no
no
wailed
the
mother
clasping
the
sick
child
frantically
in
her
arms
i
not
trust
that
negro
i
trust
no
one
but
you
lina
to
go
and
come
in
a
hurry
i
can
depend
on
you
to
do
your
best
oh
for
god
sake
lina
go
for
the
doctor
no
one
will
hurt
you
not
a
sign
of
danger
your
uncle
and
them
other
men
have
captured
the
outlaws
long
before
this
time
of
night
oh
dollie
dollie
my
darling
i
do
believe
she
dying
now
jaquelina
waited
for
no
more
urging
she
ran
out
of
the
house
with
the
cry
of
the
frightened
helpless
mother
still
ringing
in
her
ears
and
made
her
way
to
the
stable
her
uncle
had
ridden
one
of
the
horses
black
bess
the
remaining
one
stood
patiently
in
the
stall
the
mare
was
gentle
and
quite
accustomed
to
jaquelina
she
saddled
her
with
deft
skillful
fingers
led
her
out
and
vaulted
lightly
to
her
back
then
in
the
dim
light
of
the
waning
moon
the
girl
rode
out
of
the
and
set
forth
at
a
swift
gallop
for
the
town
a
mile
away
there
was
something
weird
and
strange
in
that
midnight
ride
through
the
lonely
wood
to
jaquelina
her
heart
beat
fast
as
she
guided
the
mare
through
the
thick
woods
where
the
tall
pines
stood
around
dark
and
grim
like
silent
sentinels
the
moon
had
gone
down
and
she
had
only
the
faint
light
of
the
stars
to
guide
her
on
her
perilous
way
every
moment
she
expected
to
be
confronted
by
the
outlaw
band
of
whom
she
had
heard
such
terrible
stories
a
foreboding
dread
lent
her
fresh
impetuosity
black
bess
was
panting
and
covered
with
perspiration
when
her
rider
at
length
emerged
safely
from
the
woods
and
found
herself
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
a
few
minutes
brought
her
to
the
physician
neat
residence
her
loud
halloo
soon
brought
him
to
the
window
he
promised
to
dress
and
come
to
the
baby
assistance
immediately
if
you
will
wait
a
few
minutes
miss
meredith
i
will
ride
back
with
you
the
road
at
night
is
lonely
and
dangerous
for
a
woman
the
old
doctor
said
courteously
but
having
come
over
the
road
safely
jaquelina
courage
had
risen
aunt
meredith
will
perhaps
need
my
assistance
with
the
child
she
said
so
i
had
better
ride
on
at
once
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
danger
but
if
you
ride
fast
enough
to
overtake
me
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
she
turned
as
she
spoke
and
galloped
away
a
sudden
storm
was
rising
a
cool
wind
blew
into
her
face
and
for
a
second
the
face
of
the
heavens
was
divided
by
a
keen
flash
of
lightning
that
glittered
steely
blue
like
a
sword
point
against
the
darkness
two
or
three
drops
of
rain
swirled
down
on
the
uncovered
head
and
face
it
was
fortunate
i
did
not
wait
she
thought
i
shall
barely
escape
the
storm
if
i
do
my
best
she
urged
black
bess
to
her
highest
speed
the
wind
increased
it
blew
jaquelina
short
soft
curls
into
her
face
and
across
her
eyes
the
strong
sweet
breath
of
the
pines
mixed
refreshingly
with
the
scent
of
violets
hidden
in
the
green
jaquelina
never
forgot
that
hour
it
came
back
to
her
in
after
years
dark
years
when
memory
was
a
nameless
pain
the
smell
of
violets
hidden
in
the
green
poured
back
into
my
fainting
soul
and
frame
the
times
when
i
remember
to
have
been
joyful
and
free
from
blame
she
had
reached
the
thickest
part
of
the
woods
in
safety
when
suddenly
black
bess
came
to
such
a
sudden
stop
that
her
rider
came
near
being
thrown
over
her
head
in
the
next
moment
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
showed
jaquelina
a
tall
masked
outlaw
clutching
her
bridle
rein
chapter
iv
before
the
lurid
flash
died
away
jaquelina
saw
a
second
masked
figure
emerge
from
behind
a
tree
with
a
lantern
she
heard
a
voice
exclaim
in
profound
surprise
by
jove
it
a
woman
yes
cried
the
girl
bravely
and
if
you
are
men
you
will
suffer
me
to
pass
only
cowards
would
molest
a
woman
the
second
man
flashed
the
light
of
the
lantern
into
the
pale
yet
spirited
face
by
jove
he
said
again
what
a
pretty
girl
well
miss
we
suffer
neither
man
nor
woman
to
pass
without
taking
toll
jaquelina
heart
sank
would
they
take
black
bess
her
favorite
these
were
the
horse
thieves
of
course
she
could
not
repress
the
quiver
in
her
voice
as
she
asked
faintly
what
toll
do
you
demand
we
usually
take
a
horse
miss
said
the
last
speaker
coolly
but
seeing
that
you
such
an
uncommon
pretty
girl
we
take
the
mare
and
you
shall
give
us
a
kiss
apiece
besides
the
man
had
reckoned
without
his
host
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
before
a
shower
of
keen
and
stinging
blows
rained
down
upon
his
head
and
face
from
the
little
the
girl
carried
in
her
clenched
hand
you
infamous
coward
she
cried
indignantly
take
that
and
that
and
that
for
shame
to
insult
a
helpless
woman
who
is
in
your
power
yes
you
in
my
power
and
i
make
you
pay
dearly
for
those
blows
cried
the
ruffian
plucking
her
from
the
saddle
like
a
feather
and
in
an
instant
she
was
struggling
on
the
ground
beside
him
but
the
man
who
had
held
the
mare
all
the
while
now
interfered
sternly
come
come
bowles
you
transgressing
orders
the
captain
order
is
to
allow
no
violence
but
of
course
we
take
the
mare
and
the
girl
too
said
bowles
shortly
and
sharply
still
smarting
under
the
indignity
of
the
stinging
blows
the
brave
girl
had
rained
upon
him
so
furiously
we
no
call
to
take
the
girl
said
the
other
orders
are
for
animals
not
persons
turn
her
loose
and
let
her
walk
home
no
said
bowles
with
an
oath
i
give
her
a
scare
anyway
take
her
to
the
captain
and
he
shall
say
what
punishment
she
merits
i
not
let
her
go
my
head
and
face
are
burning
with
the
blows
i
will
not
go
with
you
jaquelina
cried
out
trying
to
break
from
his
tight
clasp
you
have
no
right
to
detain
me
let
me
go
at
once
but
her
struggles
and
cries
were
silenced
effectually
by
a
stout
handkerchief
the
man
bound
over
her
mouth
then
he
sprang
to
the
mare
back
and
lifting
jaquelina
before
him
galloped
quickly
away
through
the
increasing
darkness
and
the
rain
which
now
began
to
pour
down
in
large
heavy
drops
that
speedily
wet
the
girl
thin
garments
through
and
through
jaquelina
was
beside
herself
with
terror
and
fear
of
the
ruffian
who
held
her
in
that
rough
tight
clasp
a
thousand
conflicting
thoughts
rushed
over
her
mind
she
thought
of
her
uncle
charlie
to
whom
the
loss
of
black
bess
would
be
so
severe
at
the
present
time
she
thought
of
the
sick
child
at
home
and
of
the
hard
selfish
woman
who
had
sent
her
forth
to
encounter
this
terrible
peril
every
moment
while
she
was
borne
onward
in
the
storm
and
darkness
seemed
an
eternity
of
time
to
her
bewildered
mind
she
had
no
idea
where
she
was
going
or
in
what
direction
the
gloom
and
darkness
hid
every
object
from
her
view
and
she
was
too
terrified
to
reason
clearly
at
last
they
stopped
jaquelina
felt
herself
lifted
down
from
the
mare
back
and
borne
rapidly
in
bowles
arms
along
what
seemed
to
be
a
perfectly
dark
long
and
winding
the
wind
and
rain
had
ceased
to
blow
in
her
face
and
a
damp
earthy
smell
pervaded
the
atmosphere
jaquelina
instantly
decided
that
they
were
in
a
cave
of
which
there
were
several
in
the
neighborhood
of
her
home
presently
her
captor
paused
and
gave
a
low
peculiar
whistle
several
times
repeated
enter
she
heard
a
deep
musical
voice
exclaim
bowles
seemed
to
push
aside
a
thick
and
heavy
curtain
the
next
moment
a
blaze
of
light
shone
around
him
as
he
entered
a
large
apartment
pushing
his
frightened
captive
before
him
jaquelina
was
blinded
a
moment
as
she
came
into
the
brilliant
light
from
the
outer
rain
and
darkness
then
the
mist
cleared
she
looked
up
and
found
herself
standing
before
the
stateliest
and
most
superbly
handsome
man
she
had
ever
beheld
in
her
life
tall
dark
haughty
the
outlaw
chief
was
as
kingly
in
his
beauty
as
lucifer
star
of
the
morning
might
have
looked
in
the
hour
of
his
fall
his
glossy
curls
of
hair
were
thrown
carelessly
back
from
a
brow
as
white
and
perfect
as
sculptured
marble
his
dark
and
piercing
eyes
gleamed
beneath
the
black
brows
his
nose
was
perfect
in
shape
and
contour
his
rather
stern
and
slightly
sad
lips
were
half
concealed
by
a
long
curling
mustache
black
like
his
hair
youth
power
and
strength
spoke
in
every
line
of
the
firm
and
figure
in
its
careless
yet
hunting
suit
of
fine
flannel
one
might
have
looked
for
such
a
face
and
form
at
the
head
of
a
gallant
army
bravely
leading
his
troops
to
victory
or
death
but
never
here
in
the
den
of
robbers
jaquelina
had
one
full
glance
into
that
darkly
handsome
face
one
look
that
imprinted
it
forever
on
her
memory
then
the
chief
caught
up
a
mask
that
lay
upon
a
table
near
by
and
fitted
it
hurriedly
to
his
features
the
low
deep
musical
voice
that
bade
them
enter
now
exclaimed
with
repressed
wrath
and
menace
whom
have
we
here
bowles
and
how
have
you
dared
bring
a
stranger
into
my
presence
while
i
remained
unmasked
jaquelina
saw
that
bowles
trembled
at
the
stern
anger
of
his
chief
captain
i
humbly
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
caught
this
girl
riding
a
fine
black
mare
through
the
woods
and
attempted
a
harmless
joke
upon
her
on
which
she
flew
at
me
like
a
little
tigress
and
belabored
me
with
her
i
was
so
enraged
at
her
impudence
that
i
whipped
upon
the
mare
back
and
brought
the
little
wretch
here
to
you
to
tell
me
how
to
punish
her
a
low
laugh
actually
rippled
over
the
stern
sad
lips
of
the
robber
chief
he
looked
at
jaquelina
where
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
apartment
the
falling
from
her
drenched
garments
upon
the
rich
crimson
carpet
in
shining
little
pools
the
wet
curls
clinging
to
her
white
brow
her
face
pale
as
death
her
slight
form
trembling
with
cold
and
terror
the
laugh
died
suddenly
on
his
lips
his
dark
eyes
flashed
through
the
openings
in
his
mask
for
shame
bowles
he
said
sharply
how
dared
you
assault
a
woman
we
make
no
war
upon
such
orders
were
to
take
every
fine
animal
that
passed
bowles
said
yet
sullenly
animals
yes
but
not
human
beings
least
of
all
helpless
females
i
never
counted
upon
passing
what
were
you
a
mere
slip
of
a
girl
doing
on
horseback
in
the
woods
at
the
dead
hour
of
night
he
inquired
looking
curiously
at
jaquelina
i
went
to
call
the
doctor
to
a
sick
child
she
answered
where
were
all
the
men
of
your
family
and
neighborhood
that
you
were
permitted
to
take
such
a
lonely
and
perilous
midnight
ride
inquired
the
outlaw
chief
again
fixing
his
dark
eyes
upon
her
in
surprise
not
unmixed
with
suspicion
jaquelina
flushed
hotly
beneath
that
look
my
uncle
and
all
the
neighboring
men
were
absent
she
said
returning
his
gaze
with
cool
scorn
where
he
inquired
they
have
joined
together
to
pursue
the
whom
you
have
the
honor
to
command
she
replied
defiantly
the
chief
started
then
tossed
his
handsome
head
with
a
reckless
laugh
do
you
think
it
likely
they
will
overtake
us
he
asked
sneeringly
i
can
not
tell
but
i
hope
so
i
wish
i
could
capture
said
the
girl
frankly
do
you
why
do
you
wish
so
he
inquired
nettled
i
should
like
to
earn
the
reward
of
two
hundred
dollars
that
has
been
offered
for
your
apprehension
she
replied
naively
what
would
you
do
with
it
he
asked
rather
amused
at
her
frankness
that
is
business
jaquelina
answered
with
demure
dignity
bowles
light
a
fire
i
have
been
so
interested
in
your
charming
captive
that
i
forgot
she
was
drenched
with
the
rain
take
a
seat
miss
miss
i
do
know
what
to
call
you
he
said
as
he
pushed
a
large
toward
her
my
name
is
meredith
miss
meredith
jaquelina
said
but
she
did
not
take
the
offered
chair
she
lifted
her
dark
clear
eyes
appealingly
to
the
masked
face
of
the
outlaw
captain
oh
sir
she
cried
clasping
her
white
hands
in
unconscious
pathos
let
me
have
black
bess
and
go
home
they
tell
me
you
only
rob
rich
men
who
can
afford
to
lose
their
horses
uncle
charlie
is
poor
he
has
only
his
farm
and
the
mare
and
one
horse
besides
would
you
rob
him
of
his
little
all
the
handsome
chief
looked
admiringly
at
the
sweet
girlish
face
with
its
pleading
eyes
and
wistful
lips
in
spite
of
her
terror
and
her
drenched
miserable
condition
there
was
a
strange
luring
charm
about
the
lovely
young
face
the
heart
of
the
outlaw
chief
was
strangely
stirred
by
it
miss
meredith
he
said
abruptly
i
gather
from
what
you
have
said
that
you
are
an
orphan
yes
jaquelina
said
wonderingly
there
is
one
condition
he
said
slowly
on
which
i
will
return
black
bess
to
her
owner
there
is
nothing
that
would
tempt
me
to
part
with
you
i
am
a
reckless
defiant
man
miss
meredith
i
fear
nothing
but
your
beautiful
brave
face
has
won
my
heart
from
me
at
first
sight
i
love
you
let
me
make
you
my
wife
sweet
girl
and
i
will
take
you
far
away
from
this
life
and
these
scenes
and
your
life
shall
be
a
long
bright
dream
of
love
and
happiness
chapter
the
startling
suddenness
of
the
outlaw
chief
proposal
appeared
to
take
jaquelina
breath
away
she
did
not
attempt
to
answer
him
but
remained
silently
regarding
him
in
surprise
not
unmixed
with
terror
have
i
taken
you
by
surprise
he
inquired
after
a
moment
in
a
gentler
tone
forgive
me
i
am
used
to
rough
men
not
timid
women
but
consent
to
be
my
bride
miss
meredith
and
you
will
find
me
the
tenderest
lord
a
fair
girl
ever
dreamed
of
do
not
answer
me
this
moment
take
time
to
consider
i
do
not
need
a
moment
time
to
consider
jaquelina
flashed
forth
indignantly
do
you
think
i
would
marry
a
common
robber
a
an
outlaw
she
saw
the
dark
eyes
flash
beneath
the
outlaw
mask
those
are
harsh
words
miss
meredith
he
said
with
outward
calmness
they
are
not
becoming
under
my
own
humble
roof
and
from
the
lips
of
my
guest
not
your
guest
but
your
captive
the
girl
said
bitterly
a
beloved
captive
replied
the
outlaw
child
i
do
not
know
why
my
heart
has
gone
out
to
you
so
strangely
it
is
not
your
beauty
that
has
won
me
women
more
beautiful
than
you
have
smiled
on
me
and
my
heart
was
untouched
but
the
moment
i
looked
into
your
proud
dark
eyes
my
soul
seemed
to
recognize
its
true
mate
you
flatter
me
cried
the
captive
drawing
her
slight
form
erect
with
indignant
scorn
i
the
true
mate
of
a
man
as
reckless
and
as
you
you
rate
me
highly
indeed
were
i
a
man
i
would
make
you
retract
the
insult
at
the
sword
point
how
a
duel
asked
the
outlaw
laughing
at
her
passionate
vehemence
yes
a
duel
she
answered
with
unmoved
gravity
you
are
a
brave
little
girl
miss
meredith
the
outlaw
answered
resting
his
white
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
with
easy
grace
while
he
regarded
her
attentively
you
make
me
admire
you
more
than
ever
i
am
sorry
for
that
said
jaquelina
with
spirit
why
he
inquired
seeming
to
find
pleasure
in
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
although
her
words
were
so
scornful
is
admiration
so
distasteful
to
you
from
you
it
is
she
said
and
although
he
affected
indifference
her
scornful
tone
had
an
arrow
in
it
that
secretly
pierced
his
heart
what
manner
of
a
man
might
he
be
whose
admiration
would
be
acceptable
to
you
fair
lady
he
inquired
coldly
yet
with
a
certain
wistfulness
in
his
tone
jaquelina
turned
her
dark
eyes
on
the
masked
face
of
the
outlaw
and
regarded
him
steadily
as
she
said
firmly
a
man
quite
your
opposite
in
everything
an
honest
honorable
noble
man
brave
and
without
reproach
peur
et
sans
the
ardelle
motto
muttered
the
outlaw
beneath
his
dark
mustache
so
miss
meredith
you
are
holding
up
before
me
a
glass
wherein
i
may
see
all
that
i
am
not
yes
she
said
then
after
a
minute
in
which
she
gazed
at
the
princely
form
in
unwilling
admiration
jaquelina
added
all
that
you
might
have
been
yes
all
that
i
might
have
been
he
said
in
a
saddened
and
softened
voice
are
you
a
student
of
whittier
miss
meredith
do
you
believe
with
him
that
all
sad
words
of
tongue
or
pen
the
saddest
are
these
might
have
jaquelina
gazed
in
astonishment
at
him
a
sudden
sense
of
the
strangeness
of
her
position
rushed
over
her
she
was
here
alone
in
the
outlaw
cave
and
he
was
talking
sentiment
to
her
she
clasped
her
slim
hands
together
and
the
dark
eyes
looked
at
him
pleadingly
as
she
answered
i
am
too
young
and
untutored
to
discuss
these
things
with
you
sir
and
my
mind
is
distracted
by
thoughts
of
home
release
me
if
you
please
if
you
will
only
show
me
the
outlet
of
the
cave
i
will
find
my
way
home
my
friends
will
be
alarmed
at
my
continued
absence
do
you
hear
the
storm
he
asked
it
is
pitchy
dark
the
rain
and
wind
are
fearful
and
you
are
several
miles
from
home
it
is
no
matter
said
the
girl
desperately
only
release
me
and
i
will
find
my
home
if
i
have
to
crawl
there
i
am
more
afraid
of
you
and
your
outlaw
band
than
i
am
of
the
night
and
the
darkness
he
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
child
he
said
abruptly
you
need
not
fear
me
i
would
not
harm
a
hair
on
that
little
head
and
yet
if
i
suffered
you
to
go
free
i
suppose
you
would
at
once
discover
our
to
our
enemies
jaquelina
remained
perfectly
silent
is
it
not
true
he
inquired
coldly
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
gazed
at
him
defiantly
you
mean
that
you
would
do
so
he
said
interpreting
her
look
aright
yes
for
it
would
be
my
duty
to
rid
my
neighborhood
of
such
a
scourge
she
replied
very
low
then
there
was
a
minute
of
perfect
silence
the
long
lashes
drooped
upon
her
cheeks
as
the
handsome
outlaw
studied
her
face
bowles
came
in
with
a
small
furnace
filled
with
glowing
coals
then
silently
withdrew
draw
near
to
the
fire
and
dry
your
wet
clothing
said
the
chief
abruptly
there
would
be
no
use
jaquelina
answered
coldly
i
shall
be
drenched
through
going
home
you
seem
quite
certain
of
going
he
said
amused
at
her
persistency
i
fear
you
will
be
disappointed
miss
meredith
i
regret
the
fact
of
bowles
bringing
you
here
very
much
and
i
shall
order
him
to
apologize
to
you
for
doing
so
but
i
must
tell
you
that
my
own
safety
demands
that
i
shall
keep
you
a
prisoner
in
this
cave
until
such
time
as
we
shall
decide
to
leave
the
neighborhood
when
if
you
shall
still
persist
in
refusing
my
hand
i
may
perhaps
release
you
jaquelina
made
an
impulsive
rush
toward
the
heavy
curtains
that
shut
in
the
comfortable
apartment
from
the
outer
darkness
of
the
cave
but
the
voice
of
the
outlaw
arrested
her
with
her
hand
upon
the
thick
hanging
i
should
not
advise
you
to
attempt
leaving
without
my
consent
miss
meredith
i
have
sentries
stationed
through
the
cave
you
would
scarcely
find
them
so
courteous
as
myself
the
white
hands
fell
from
the
heavy
curtains
in
dismay
jaquelina
remembered
the
rude
officious
bowles
and
accepted
the
statement
as
true
she
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
disgust
why
do
you
who
appear
to
have
the
instincts
and
the
training
of
a
gentleman
herd
with
such
ruffians
she
asked
promise
to
marry
me
and
i
will
tell
you
why
he
replied
i
will
give
up
this
life
and
try
to
become
that
which
you
said
just
now
i
might
have
been
miss
meredith
i
am
in
serious
earnest
become
my
wife
and
i
swear
to
you
that
you
shall
not
have
one
wish
ungratified
i
am
wealthy
i
will
take
you
away
to
some
fair
bright
clime
where
my
history
is
all
unknown
costly
jewels
splendid
silks
and
laces
all
that
the
heart
of
woman
desires
shall
be
yours
with
the
adoration
of
a
heart
as
true
as
truth
i
care
nothing
for
these
things
jaquelina
answered
crimsoning
with
anger
and
disdain
you
have
had
my
answer
sooner
than
link
my
fate
with
one
so
wicked
and
as
your
own
i
would
die
here
at
your
feet
do
i
then
appear
so
utterly
vile
in
the
clear
eyes
of
a
pure
woman
inquired
the
outlaw
chief
in
a
voice
strangely
tinctured
with
melancholy
jaquelina
had
drawn
near
the
glowing
furnace
of
coals
unconsciously
attracted
by
the
warmth
that
stole
deliciously
over
her
drenched
and
shivering
frame
she
was
too
young
and
untouched
by
real
sorrow
to
understand
the
vague
remorse
and
pathos
that
quivered
in
the
man
low
voice
yet
when
she
answered
yes
it
was
a
trifle
more
gently
and
kindly
i
could
never
teach
you
to
love
me
then
he
said
questioningly
no
the
girl
said
decidedly
with
her
curly
head
set
sidewise
and
such
an
owlish
gravity
about
her
that
the
outlaw
chief
who
seemed
to
be
all
things
by
turns
and
nothing
long
felt
his
risibilities
excited
and
laughed
outright
why
do
you
laugh
she
inquired
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
meredith
for
my
rudeness
he
said
but
as
you
stood
there
with
the
steam
from
your
drenched
clothing
rising
over
your
head
and
the
furnace
blazing
at
your
feet
you
reminded
me
so
comically
of
one
of

witches
that
i
was
forced
to
laugh
jaquelina
was
thoroughly
angry
to
be
laughed
at
by
this
man
whom
she
scorned
was
too
much
she
stepped
back
into
the
darkest
and
coldest
corner
of
the
room
and
stood
there
in
silent
dignified
displeasure
pray
do
not
allow
my
silly
jest
to
drive
you
away
from
the
fire
he
exclaimed
anxiously
let
me
entreat
you
to
return
but
his
captive
had
sunk
down
upon
the
floor
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
folding
his
arms
across
his
breast
the
outlaw
chief
walked
up
and
down
across
the
soft
echoless
carpet
his
gloomy
eyes
fixed
immovably
upon
the
little
crouching
figure
with
the
graceful
head
bowed
on
the
clasped
hands
jaquelina
looked
very
childish
and
forlorn
as
she
crouched
there
quite
suddenly
she
broke
into
a
perfectly
audible
sob
of
grief
and
i
shall
miss
violet
earle
party
after
all
and
i
had
been
so
happy
over
it
it
was
the
cry
of
a
child
over
a
broken
toy
yet
its
artless
pathos
pierced
the
man
heart
he
went
quickly
and
knelt
down
beside
her
little
one
what
is
this
that
you
grieve
for
he
asked
almost
tenderly
tell
me
it
is
only
only
sobbed
the
girl
that
you
will
cause
me
to
lose
the
happiest
hour
of
my
life
poor
child
and
life
has
so
few
happy
hours
said
the
outlaw
chief
tell
me
what
it
is
you
lament
so
much
perhaps
i
may
relent
it
was
miss
violet
earle
night
sobbed
jaquelina
she
had
invited
me
i
i
was
never
at
a
party
in
my
life
and
i
wanted
so
much
to
see
what
it
was
like
the
listener
frowned
then
smiled
beneath
his
concealing
mask
do
not
weep
for
that
he
said
i
will
tell
you
what
every
party
is
like
little
girl
a
party
is
an
occasion
when
somebody
else
has
a
prettier
dress
than
yours
and
somebody
else
dances
with
your
favorite
beau
once
more
than
you
did
and
when
you
get
home
you
are
mad
and
say
you
would
have
gone
if
you
had
known
it
so
there
i
do
believe
it
wept
jaquelina
obstinately
at
least
not
all
of
it
it
may
be
true
about
the
dress
i
violet
earle
will
be
so
prettier
than
mine
but
i
should
never
never
wish
i
had
not
gone
there
ah
jaquelina
jaquelina
if
those
dark
eyes
dimmed
now
with
childish
tears
could
but
have
pierced
the
secret
of
the
untried
future
she
is
but
a
simple
child
the
outlaw
said
to
himself
pityingly
only
a
little
wild
bird
i
have
caged
it
but
it
would
never
sing
for
me
i
must
let
it
fly
back
to
its
nest
he
touched
the
girl
damp
clinging
curls
lightly
miss
meredith
look
up
at
me
he
said
jaquelina
lifted
her
wet
eyes
inquiringly
can
not
you
leave
me
in
peace
she
asked
shrinking
from
his
light
touch
impatiently
he
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
pretty
childish
petulance
little
bird
he
said
i
will
give
you
your
freedom
if
you
will
promise
me
just
one
thing
you
will
not
reveal
the
secret
of
this
cavern
retreat
to
my
enemies
it
is
the
only
price
by
which
you
can
purchase
freedom
since
it
is
my
only
chance
of
release
i
must
needs
keep
the
secret
jaquelina
said
reluctantly
what
shall
i
tell
them
only
say
that
you
were
lost
in
the
woods
and
that
the
outlaw
chief
guided
you
to
the
road
again
he
replied
very
well
she
replied
but
i
warn
you
that
if
ever
i
see
you
elsewhere
i
will
attempt
to
capture
you
he
looked
at
the
frank
determined
face
a
moment
then
laughed
at
the
threat
ten
minutes
after
he
was
riding
by
jaquelina
side
through
the
stormy
woods
when
the
first
faint
beams
of
daylight
glimmered
in
the
cloudy
east
he
watched
her
riding
safely
toward
home
mounted
on
the
faithful
black
bess
miss
meredith
he
had
said
as
they
parted
when
you
think
of
the
outlaw
whose
love
you
scorned
do
not
forget
that
the
bravest
thing
a
brave
man
can
do
is
to
voluntarily
resign
the
one
fair
woman
who
holds
his
heart
but
jaquelina
with
a
cold
and
haughty
bow
rode
silently
away
chapter
vi
all
the
people
we
invited
are
here
mamma
said
violet
earle
all
except
jaquelina
meredith
do
you
think
she
will
come
laurel
hill
the
beautiful
home
of
the
earles
was
in
a
blaze
of
light
and
gayety
the
handsome
roomy
mansion
with
its
wide
and
long
piazzas
and
large
bay
windows
was
lighted
from
garret
to
basement
and
thrown
open
to
the
guests
the
beautiful
green
lawn
with
its
sprinkling
of
laurel
trees
that
gave
the
place
its
name
was
almost
as
light
as
day
with
the
glitter
of
colored
lamps
and
chinese
lanterns
a
pretty
in
the
center
of
the
lawn
was
decorated
with
garlands
of
cedar
and
fluttering
silken
banners
it
was
here
that
violet
was
standing
when
she
spoke
to
her
mother
she
looked
very
sweet
and
winning
as
she
stood
there
the
light
shining
down
on
the
fair
flushed
face
and
on
the
golden
ringlets
looped
back
with
sprays
of
nestling
among
dark
green
leaves
she
wore
a
soft
filmy
white
robe
and
a
wide
sash
of
satin
was
knotted
carelessly
around
the
slender
waist
the
pretty
dimpled
neck
and
arms
were
quite
bare
and
golden
ornaments
studded
with
pearls
and
turquoise
gleamed
upon
their
whiteness
earle
looking
very
fair
and
graceful
in
silk
and
pale
gleaming
pearls
looked
admiringly
at
her
lovely
daughter
no
i
am
afraid
jaquelina
will
not
come
she
said
one
of
the
neighbors
was
telling
me
just
now
that
she
was
lost
in
the
woods
last
night
and
thoroughly
drenched
by
the
rain
so
it
is
just
possible
she
may
be
had
you
not
heard
it
dear
yes
brown
told
me
answered
violet
and
only
think
mamma
she
met
the
captain
of
the
outlaws
and
he
guided
her
to
the
road
was
it
not
romantic
i
should
not
have
expected
such
courtesy
from
such
a
dreadful
man
it
was
perfectly
shameful
for
meredith
to
have
sent
her
for
the
doctor
at
midnight
said
earle
warmly
they
tell
me
there
was
no
real
necessity
for
such
a
thing
the
child
only
had
a
common
attack
of
croup
which
any
sensible
mother
would
have
known
how
to
subdue
with
simple
domestic
remedies
brown
their
near
neighbor
tells
me
it
is
playing
about
the
floor
as
well
as
usual
poor
lina
that
terrible
man
might
have
killed
her
said
pretty
violet
with
a
shudder
look
violet
who
is
that
coming
now
said
earle
suddenly
violet
looked
hastily
oh
she
said
it
is
meredith
he
is
bringing
her
after
all
the
farmer
came
up
the
steps
jaquelina
following
in
his
wake
a
veil
tied
about
her
head
a
thin
summer
shawl
wrapped
about
her
shoulders
they
told
me
i
should
find
you
here
i
have
brought
my
niece
to
the
party
earle
she
had
a
cold
but
i
could
persuade
her
to
stay
at
home
he
said
i
will
go
back
now
as
wife
and
dollie
are
alone
but
if
you
tell
me
when
the
party
will
be
over
i
bring
back
the
mare
for
lina
you
need
not
trouble
about
that
earle
replied
as
he
turned
away
i
see
that
she
gets
back
safely
mr
meredith
then
she
turned
to
jaquelina
who
stood
beside
violet
gazing
with
timid
delight
at
the
illuminated
lawn
and
the
moving
groups
of
people
you
may
lay
aside
your
wraps
dear
she
said
kindly
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
our
little
party
i
i
shall
the
girl
answered
gazing
around
her
with
sparkling
eyes
oh
earle
how
beautiful
it
all
is
it
seems
just
like
fairyland
earle
smiled
indulgently
as
she
helped
her
to
remove
the
plain
shawl
and
veil
that
enveloped
her
then
she
started
back
with
a
little
cry
of
surprise
that
was
faintly
by
violet
jaquelina
sensitive
lips
quivered
her
dark
eyes
filled
with
quick
tears
i
was
afraid
the
dress
would
not
do
she
said
falteringly
i
will
put
on
my
wraps
and
go
home
again
mrs
earle
she
was
turning
toward
the
steps
but
violet
caught
her
arm
oh
you
little
goose
she
said
laughing
come
back
where
you
get
such
a
sweet
dress
it
pretty
will
it
do
indeed
asked
jaquelina
radiant
it
is
lovely
earle
said
kindly
it
makes
you
look
extremely
pretty
my
dear
is
faint
praise
mother
said
her
handsome
son
as
he
came
up
the
steps
and
overheard
the
words
miss
lina
how
do
you
do
you
have
blossomed
into
a
beauty
since
i
last
saw
you
his
who
had
come
up
the
steps
with
him
peered
over
his
shoulder
at
the
beauty
he
saw
a
shy
lovely
face
with
lips
and
large
dark
eyes
with
long
black
lashes
like
fringed
curtains
chestnut
curls
tinged
with
gold
clustering
about
a
low
broad
brow
and
head
a
quaint
pretty
dress
of
yellowish
india
muslin
with
lace
and
satin
ribbons
fluttering
about
it
nothing
more
quaintly
sweet
and
pretty
than
the
dress
and
its
wearer
could
have
been
imagined
jaquelina
gave
her
hand
shyly
a
moment
to
walter
earle
then
he
stepped
aside
to
introduce
her
to
his
friend
miss
meredith
allow
me
to
present
to
you
my
friend
ronald
valchester
jaquelina
bowed
to
a
tall
man
with
dark
hair
thrown
carelessly
back
from
a
high
white
brow
and
eyes
in
quiet
moments
in
moments
of
excitement
he
touched
the
girl
slim
brown
hand
lightly
with
his
firm
white
one
then
stepped
quietly
aside
a
moment
later
and
allowed
walter
earle
to
lead
her
out
upon
the
lawn
my
friend
is
not
what
you
would
call
a
walter
said
to
her
he
is
a
dreamy
student
quite
absorbed
in
his
books
and
yet
the
best
friend
and
the
bravest
that
man
ever
had
he
is
very
intellectual
and
leads
in
everything
at
college
we
are
all
proud
of
him
there
miss
meredith
you
have
read
of
men
who
stood
head
and
shoulders
above
their
fellows
valchester
is
one
of
them
i
could
tell
you
a
hundred
delightful
things
that
he
has
done
if
you
walter
i
never
forgive
you
if
you
say
another
word
said
valchester
voice
behind
them
walter
turned
and
saw
his
friend
walking
after
him
with
violet
clinging
to
his
arm
listeners
never
hear
good
of
themselves
he
retorted
to
cover
his
embarrassment
at
being
overheard
the
old
adage
is
falsified
in
this
case
laughed
valchester
and
for
fear
of
not
coming
up
to
the
ideal
you
have
raised
in
miss
mind
i
shall
always
tread
on
thorns
in
her
presence
walter
earle
laughed
lightly
at
the
careless
metaphor
then
the
path
will
be
too
he
said
for
where
there
are
thorns
there
are
roses
talking
of
roses
said
violet
reminds
me
to
ask
you
lina
where
are
the
flowers
i
told
you
to
wear
you
forgot
them
no
i
did
not
said
the
girl
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
violet
i
did
not
have
the
time
to
gather
a
single
flower
i
was
late
as
it
was
for
you
see
aunt
meredith
needed
me
so
long
i
could
scarcely
get
away
but
i
thought
perhaps
you
could
spare
me
a
flower
as
many
as
you
like
said
violet
generously
what
will
you
have
here
we
are
at
the
make
your
own
selection
i
am
afraid
of
the
gardener
laughed
jaquelina
shrinking
back
from
the
trim
and
i
will
take
anything
you
choose
to
give
me
daisies
would
suit
you
said
walter
earle
looking
at
the
sweet
shy
face
scarlet
geraniums
or
roses
said
violet
thinking
how
beautifully
they
would
contrast
with
the
dark
eyes
and
the
white
dress
ronald
valchester
studied
the
drooping
face
attentively
as
the
dark
eyes
gazed
at
the
brilliant
flowers
the
dark
curling
lashes
shading
the
cheek
i
think
he
said
and
gathered
a
cluster
of
the
bright
flowers
from
the
trellis
and
offered
them
to
her
she
took
them
with
a
slight
bow
and
fastened
them
in
her
belt
what
had
ronald
valchester
the
gifted
thoughtful
student
read
in
the
lovely
innocent
face
of
the
simple
girl
that
had
prompted
him
to
offer
her
for
her
type
walter
earle
looked
surprised
but
he
set
it
down
as
one
of
valchester
odd
freaks
and
told
jaquelina
that
the
flowers
were
very
becoming
violet
said
that
roses
would
have
looked
prettier
then
she
gathered
some
dewy
violets
and
pinned
them
on
his
coat
with
pretty
careless
coquetry
lina
we
are
going
to
have
a
dance
on
the
lawn
said
the
latter
do
you
like
to
dance
no
said
jaquelina
and
the
fitful
color
came
and
went
in
her
cheeks
why
not
violet
said
surprised
because
i
do
not
know
how
to
dance
jaquelina
said
so
timidly
and
naively
that
walter
earle
and
ronald
valchester
laughed
then
walter
said
oh
that
is
nothing
you
must
dance
with
me
i
will
show
you
how
to
do
the
steps
and
the
figures
you
are
sure
i
shall
not
appear
awkward
she
asked
her
sensitive
pride
on
the
alert
you
could
not
be
awkward
if
you
tried
ever
so
hard
said
the
gallant
young
collegiate
captivated
by
the
artless
shyness
and
prettiness
of
the
little
girl
whom
at
first
he
had
only
meant
to
patronize
so
they
danced
together
jaquelina
fell
into
it
all
so
naturally
and
happily
that
no
one
felt
inclined
to
laugh
at
her
when
now
and
then
she
made
a
misstep
or
caused
a
whole
quadrille
to
blunder
she
was
so
ashamed
and
penitent
over
her
little
mistakes
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
set
her
right
and
forgive
her
we
pardon
so
many
errors
in
youth
and
beauty
after
awhile
ronald
valchester
dancing
with
violet
said
carelessly
your
friend
miss
meredith
is
exceedingly
pretty
is
she
not
miss
earle
violet
looked
across
at
jaquelina
who
was
dancing
with
someone
whom
walter
had
introduced
to
her
a
handsome
manly
young
fellow
who
seemed
to
admire
his
partner
very
much
she
was
startled
at
the
radiant
beauty
that
happiness
had
kindled
in
jaquelina
changeful
face
she
is
not
always
so
pretty
violet
said
quickly
it
is
the
effect
of
the
moonlight
and
lamplight
you
should
see
her
at
home
by
daylight
she
is
tanned
and
sunburned
and
terribly
shabby
would
you
believe
she
is
wearing
her
dead
mother
i
should
not
have
thought
it
he
said
it
is
a
very
nice
dress
is
it
not
and
he
looked
more
carefully
at
the
girl
who
was
dancing
in
her
dead
mother
with
the
half
falling
from
the
satin
girdle
that
bound
the
slender
waist
the
girl
who
was
so
pretty
and
happy
in
the
lamplight
and
moonlight
and
so
tanned
and
shabby
by
daylight
i
have
heard
of
beauties
miss
earle
he
said
carelessly
i
suppose
miss
meredith
must
belong
to
that
class
violet
felt
uncomfortable
she
could
not
have
told
why
for
she
had
only
spoken
what
she
felt
to
be
true
yes
she
answered
i
suppose
so
i
have
known
lina
meredith
all
my
life
or
nearly
but
i
never
thought
her
pretty
until
we
will
call
upon
her
at
her
own
home
you
may
see
for
yourself
how
different
she
will
appear
i
shall
be
pleased
to
go
thank
you
said
ronald
valchester
is
miss
meredith
the
only
daughter
violet
looked
at
him
surprised
why
of
course
she
began
then
stopped
and
said
deprecatingly
i
have
perhaps
done
lina
an
injustice
in
speaking
of
her
as
i
have
to
you
valchester
i
thought
you
knew
that
she
is
an
orphan
it
her
fault
that
she
must
go
shabby
and
neglected
she
is
poor
and
has
no
one
to
love
her
violet
looked
very
pretty
in
the
thoughtful
student
eyes
just
then
much
prettier
than
she
had
five
minutes
ago
as
he
clasped
the
little
hand
in
the
winding
figures
of
the
gay
dance
he
thought
that
the
touch
of
womanly
pity
in
her
voice
was
very
winning
more
than
once
he
looked
at
the
slender
figure
of
jaquelina
as
it
whirled
past
him
lightly
with
a
new
interest
in
his
eyes
she
had
been
simply
a
pretty
interesting
girl
to
him
before
in
whose
radiant
face
he
had
vaguely
read
something
that
prompted
him
to
give
her
the
now
the
vibrating
chord
of
sympathy
in
his
nature
had
been
touched
by
those
simple
words
she
has
no
one
to
love
her
when
that
dance
was
over
and
violet
had
been
claimed
by
another
partner
he
went
up
to
jaquelina
you
have
not
danced
with
me
yet
he
said
will
you
give
me
the
next
dance
miss
meredith
you
must
excuse
me
valchester
she
replied
with
a
smile
i
have
promised
the
next
dance
to
your
friend
mr
earle
chapter
vii
jaquelina
saw
that
the
young
student
looked
surprised
you
have
danced
with
walter
earle
twice
already
he
said
do
you
not
know
that
it
is
not
considered
to
dance
more
than
twice
with
the
same
partner
she
looked
at
him
puzzled
for
an
instant
then
the
long
lashes
drooped
and
the
ready
color
flashed
into
her
cheek
as
she
answered
i
do
not
think
i
understand
what
means
mr
valchester
i
beg
your
pardon
for
using
a
french
phrase
said
ronald
valchester
uncertain
whether
she
was
in
earnest
or
meant
to
rebuke
him
i
am
aware
that
the
habit
is
considered
an
affectation
but
one
falls
into
these
things
so
naturally
at
college
you
know
miss
meredith
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
explain
it
to
her
it
had
vaguely
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
teasing
him
and
he
relapsed
at
once
into
his
grave
dignity
but
the
next
instant
he
saw
that
he
had
been
mistaken
she
raised
her
clear
dark
eyes
to
his
face
and
said
gratefully
you
do
not
laugh
at
my
ignorance
valchester
then
i
may
dare
to
ask
you
a
favor
as
she
spoke
she
drew
a
ring
from
her
finger
and
held
it
out
to
him
will
you
translate
for
me
the
french
words
in
this
ring
she
said
many
times
afterward
she
wondered
what
had
given
her
such
courage
to
ask
ronald
valchester
this
question
she
had
always
been
too
timid
to
ask
anyone
before
the
student
took
the
ring
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
swung
in
the
tree
above
their
heads
the
diamond
flashed
and
sparkled
in
the
antique
setting
he
read
out
aloud
peur
et
sans
it
is
a
french
motto
miss
meredith
it
simply
means
fear
and
without
reproach
oh
what
beautiful
words
she
cried
thank
you
valchester
very
much
all
my
life
i
have
wanted
to
know
what
those
words
in
ring
meant
anyone
almost
could
have
told
you
he
replied
as
he
handed
it
back
to
her
did
you
never
ask
anyone
no
i
was
ashamed
to
confess
such
pitiable
ignorance
she
answered
frankly
you
see
valchester
my
mother
was
french
and
it
seemed
so
odd
that
i
should
be
ignorant
of
her
no
one
could
laugh
at
you
for
that
said
ronald
valchester
kindly
he
was
leaning
against
the
tree
carelessly
and
jaquelina
sat
on
the
rustic
bench
beneath
it
the
soft
white
folds
of
her
dress
falling
on
the
velvety
green
turf
a
little
beyond
them
was
the
cedar
hedge
that
bounded
the
trim
lawn
jaquelina
did
not
know
what
dark
gleaming
eyes
watched
her
beauty
as
she
sat
there
with
the
light
falling
down
on
her
girlish
face
and
form
she
was
looking
at
her
companion
and
recalling
the
words
in
which
walter
earle
had
praised
him
he
is
handsome
too
she
said
to
herself
what
a
beautiful
high
white
brow
and
face
earle
must
be
very
proud
to
have
him
for
his
friend
valchester
are
you
a
poet
she
asked
suddenly
no
one
ever
accused
me
of
being
one
he
answered
laughing
why
do
you
ask
me
miss
meredith
you
look
like
one
she
said
ronald
valchester
laughed
again
did
you
ever
see
a
poet
miss
meredith
he
asked
then
jaquelina
started
and
blushed
no
in
truth
i
never
did
she
said
it
was
only
my
fancy
perhaps
i
should
have
expressed
my
thought
better
if
i
had
said
that
you
realize
my
ideal
of
how
a
poet
should
look
you
flatter
me
he
said
smiling
yet
in
his
heart
ronald
valchester
was
pleased
at
her
words
for
he
saw
that
she
meant
them
and
had
no
thought
of
flattering
him
quite
naturally
he
said
to
her
after
a
moment
of
silent
thought
are
you
fond
of
poetry
miss
meredith
i
love
it
better
than
anything
in
the
world
she
replied
with
enthusiasm
tell
me
the
name
of
your
favorite
poet
he
said
he
saw
the
quick
sensitive
flush
of
shame
leap
into
the
soft
cheek
at
the
natural
question
i
can
not
tell
you
she
said
i
have
had
no
fair
opportunity
of
making
up
my
mind
i
have
read
bits
from
them
all
but
never
a
whole
volume
we
have
not
many
books
at
home
it
seemed
only
kindness
that
he
should
say
then
will
you
permit
me
to
lend
you
some
of
my
books
miss
meredith
i
have
all
the
poets
i
will
send
you
down
a
box
from
college
thank
you
she
said
flushing
with
pleasure
i
will
be
very
careful
with
them
mr
valchester
either
walter
earle
had
forgotten
her
or
something
had
detained
him
another
set
was
forming
but
he
did
not
come
to
claim
her
hand
the
dance
was
made
up
and
she
sat
still
and
waited
while
the
wild
entrancing
strains
of
music
filled
the
night
with
melody
ronald
valchester
did
not
seek
another
partner
he
sat
down
by
jaquelina
side
and
talked
to
her
of
books
and
poetry
now
and
then
he
repeated
pretty
bits
from
his
favorite
authors
to
which
she
listened
eagerly
it
was
very
pleasant
the
night
was
so
bright
and
warm
the
scene
was
so
gay
and
brilliant
the
heavy
odorous
perfume
of
honeysuckles
and
roses
freighted
the
air
the
moon
shone
bright
and
clear
the
stars
seemed
to
twinkle
with
joy
in
her
mind
jaquelina
silently
contrasted
it
with
last
night
could
it
be
possible
that
only
last
night
she
was
kneeling
wet
and
cold
and
wretched
in
the
outlaw
cavern
retreat
pleading
for
liberty
she
who
sat
here
free
and
happy
and
listened
to
the
musical
voice
of
ronald
valchester
murmuring
lovely
lines
and
gentle
thoughts
from
the
poets
she
loved
she
shivered
as
if
with
cold
as
the
striking
contrast
presented
itself
to
her
mind
it
is
a
delightful
party
she
said
to
herself
i
would
not
have
missed
it
for
anything
i
have
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
just
then
walter
earle
came
hurrying
up
to
them
miss
meredith
i
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
he
cried
our
dance
is
almost
over
but
i
did
not
know
it
was
on
until
this
moment
you
see
i
had
gone
into
the
house
and
was
talking
to
my
father
and
some
of
the
older
people
and
i
did
not
hear
the
music
will
you
excuse
me
and
give
me
another
dance
you
are
perfectly
excusable
sir
she
said
but
she
stopped
and
looked
at
ronald
valchester
i
have
just
been
telling
her
said
valchester
that
it
is
neither
customary
nor
fair
to
give
so
many
dances
to
one
person
walter
earle
flushed
slightly
as
i
am
her
teacher
he
said
that
objection
should
not
apply
to
me
i
have
been
showing
her
how
to
do
the
steps
and
figures
no
one
else
volunteered
to
teach
her
you
did
not
valchester
it
was
valchester
turn
to
blush
now
it
was
very
careless
and
selfish
in
me
that
i
did
not
he
replied
but
i
am
sufficiently
punished
for
it
as
i
have
not
been
able
to
secure
her
for
my
partner
a
single
time
well
suppose
we
adjourn
to
the
house
now
said
walter
refreshments
are
served
in
the
and
mamma
has
sent
me
to
hurry
you
in
said
violet
appearing
on
the
scene
with
a
merry
party
of
young
people
in
her
wake
they
went
into
the
house
and
jaquelina
found
herself
placed
between
walter
earle
and
ronald
valchester
at
table
violet
was
on
the
other
side
of
valchester
they
formed
a
merry
party
the
long
table
sparkled
with
silver
and
and
flowers
and
the
dishes
were
loaded
with
rare
and
dainty
edibles
and
delicious
fruits
but
jaquelina
was
too
happy
and
excited
to
eat
she
drank
in
pleasure
from
the
sights
and
sounds
about
her
the
bright
happy
faces
the
joyous
voices
the
hour
that
was
spent
at
the
table
passed
like
a
dream
of
pleasure
but
afterward
she
remembered
that
she
had
only
trifled
with
her
knife
and
fork
she
had
been
too
excited
to
eat
when
they
left
the
table
the
young
people
all
went
into
the
parlor
violet
had
a
new
piano
a
fine
instrument
that
she
laughingly
said
it
was
a
perfect
delight
to
touch
several
of
the
young
ladies
sang
and
played
jaquelina
sat
quietly
at
the
window
and
listened
music
was
a
passion
with
her
it
seemed
to
stir
a
thousand
slumbering
harmonies
into
life
within
her
heart
do
you
play
said
valchester
a
voice
beside
her
presently
no
i
have
never
been
taught
she
answered
and
he
caught
the
faint
tone
of
regret
in
the
low
voice
but
you
love
music
he
said
dearly
she
answered
with
unconscious
pathos
you
have
not
had
a
fashionable
education
miss
meredith
i
suppose
he
said
and
was
sorry
for
the
words
a
moment
after
as
he
saw
the
sensitive
color
tinge
her
cheek
why
do
you
say
so
she
asked
toying
nervously
with
the
heavy
fringe
of
the
curtain
do
i
betray
my
ignorance
so
plainly
excuse
me
not
in
the
least
he
replied
i
guessed
so
because
you
do
not
play
i
am
an
orphan
valchester
she
said
raising
her
dark
eyes
to
his
face
a
moment
she
seemed
to
think
that
all
was
said
in
that
a
song
valchester
said
violet
earle
looking
round
from
the
piano
toward
the
window
it
is
your
turn
now
valchester
valchester
cried
a
score
of
voices
jaquelina
thought
he
looked
annoyed
i
am
not
in
voice
he
began
no
excuses
laughed
walter
earle
who
was
turning
over
some
sheets
of
music
send
him
away
from
the
window
miss
meredith
valchester
looked
at
her
shall
you
do
so
he
asked
i
should
like
to
hear
you
sing
she
replied
simply
very
well
i
will
sing
for
you
he
answered
as
he
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
stool
which
violet
vacated
as
he
came
up
the
long
white
hands
swept
over
the
pearl
keys
lightly
a
rush
of
divine
melody
filled
the
room
jaquelina
shivered
it
was
so
weirdly
thrillingly
sweet
he
sang
song
after
song
in
a
full
rich
tenor
voice
seeming
to
lose
himself
in
the
strains
almost
without
knowing
it
jaquelina
arose
and
went
over
to
the
piano
standing
by
violet
who
was
turning
the
leaves
of
the
music
he
glanced
up
at
her
with
a
slight
smile
and
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
sparkling
with
pleasure
or
excitement
they
were
glittering
starry
black
he
has
the
sweetest
tenor
voice
in
the
country
violet
whispered
to
her
is
it
not
a
perfect
treat
to
hear
him
sing
jaquelina
thought
so
but
she
only
whispered
yes
very
faintly
she
did
not
wish
to
lose
a
note
of
the
perfect
strains
at
last
he
rose
abruptly
i
have
made
you
all
twice
thankful
he
laughed
that
is
my
worst
fault
when
i
am
induced
to
play
i
never
know
when
to
stop
no
one
could
be
induced
to
touch
the
piano
after
ronald
valchester
had
played
his
music
was
too
superior
to
anyone
else
they
all
went
out
on
the
lawn
again
some
danced
some
wandered
under
the
trees
among
these
latter
was
jaquelina
she
was
walking
with
walter
earle
again
and
violet
with
ronald
valchester
it
was
growing
far
into
the
night
some
of
the
lights
had
burned
low
the
moon
was
about
to
go
down
the
trees
grew
thick
where
they
were
walking
and
some
sudden
impulse
made
jaquelina
shiver
and
lift
her
eyes
half
nervously
as
she
did
so
she
met
the
burning
gaze
of
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
watching
her
from
behind
a
tree
a
scream
of
surprise
and
terror
jaquelina
pulled
her
hand
from
walter
earle
arm
and
rushed
forward
the
outlaw
chief
for
it
was
no
other
was
turning
to
fly
but
she
caught
his
arm
and
held
it
tightly
in
both
her
own
the
outlaw
the
outlaw
she
panted
do
not
let
him
escape
he
was
surrounded
in
an
instant
he
made
no
attempt
to
fly
but
stood
still
gazing
around
him
on
the
angry
faces
of
the
men
and
his
dark
eyes
blazed
as
they
rested
on
the
excited
face
of
the
fair
girl
who
had
betrayed
him
to
his
enemies
chapter
viii
one
of
the
men
who
was
holding
the
captive
looked
at
jaquelina
and
said
miss
meredith
is
this
really
the
man
you
say
he
is
yes
he
is
really
the
chief
of
the
outlaws
she
replied
but
her
eyes
fell
as
they
all
looked
at
her
the
swift
color
came
into
her
cheek
no
one
thought
of
doubting
her
word
they
had
all
heard
the
story
of
her
adventure
in
the
woods
last
night
that
she
had
lost
her
way
in
the
terrible
storm
and
the
outlaw
chief
had
guided
her
to
the
road
are
you
quite
sure
of
his
identity
she
looked
at
the
dark
handsome
face
that
was
regarding
her
so
intently
every
feature
was
stamped
indelibly
on
her
memory
i
am
perfectly
sure
she
replied
he
was
unmasked
when
i
saw
him
at
first
i
remember
his
face
perfectly
are
you
really
gerald
huntington
they
asked
him
i
am
called
by
that
name
he
responded
almost
mechanically
without
looking
at
them
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
remove
his
eyes
from
jaquelina
meredith
flushed
and
defiant
face
and
this
is
your
gratitude
miss
meredith
he
said
slowly
last
night
you
were
in
my
power
i
had
every
temptation
to
hold
you
a
prisoner
but
i
yielded
to
pity
and
let
you
go
free
you
reward
me
by
betraying
me
into
the
hands
of
my
enemies
i
warned
you
i
should
do
so
she
answered
spiritedly
why
did
you
come
here
i
had
a
fancy
for
seeing
you
again
he
answered
boldly
last
night
when
you
wept
so
bitterly
at
the
thought
of
missing
this
i
wondered
if
it
would
really
make
you
as
happy
as
you
thought
the
fancy
seized
me
to
come
and
see
i
did
not
believe
you
would
betray
me
even
if
you
saw
me
why
did
you
think
so
i
had
warned
you
i
would
she
replied
i
thought
that
common
gratitude
would
have
restrained
you
i
did
not
merit
this
treatment
at
your
hands
was
his
reply
miss
meredith
has
acted
exactly
right
said
one
of
his
captors
coarsely
i
look
upon
her
as
a
real
heroine
everyone
will
feel
pleased
and
relieved
when
they
hear
that
she
has
actually
captured
the
scourge
of
the
country
aye
she
has
done
what
men
set
out
to
do
last
night
and
failed
in
said
another
jaquelina
lifted
her
drooping
head
a
little
at
their
words
of
praise
at
the
outlaw
words
it
had
drooped
upon
her
breast
she
has
treated
me
ungenerously
repeated
gerald
huntington
scornfully
as
he
looked
at
the
girl
defenders
when
she
fell
into
my
power
last
night
i
treated
her
fairly
and
honorably
i
will
leave
it
to
any
of
you
whether
she
has
repaid
me
in
like
manner
his
dark
flashing
eyes
ran
round
the
circle
of
eager
excited
faces
under
the
dim
waning
light
of
the
flickering
lamp
in
a
moment
he
lifted
his
finger
and
pointed
at
ronald
valchester
who
stood
apart
silently
regarding
the
curious
scene
you
sir
said
the
outlaw
have
a
noble
face
and
clear
eyes
that
no
deceit
can
blind
you
can
understand
what
is
meant
by
that
much
abused
term
honor
i
will
leave
it
to
you
has
miss
meredith
used
me
fairly
it
was
a
striking
scene
it
was
past
the
midnight
hour
the
moon
was
sinking
behind
the
distant
hills
the
starlight
and
the
flickering
lamplight
shone
weirdly
down
on
the
glistening
laurel
trees
and
on
the
eager
curious
crowd
about
that
central
figure
the
outlaw
chief
his
splendid
form
was
drawn
haughtily
erect
his
head
was
raised
and
his
white
hand
pointed
at
the
grave
noble
face
of
ronald
valchester
between
the
two
figures
was
jaquelina
meredith
lovely
frightened
yet
hanging
with
her
whole
heart
on
ronald
decision
he
did
not
know
how
eagerly
and
fearfully
she
awaited
his
words
yet
gerald
huntington
as
he
looked
at
her
more
than
half
guessed
it
he
remembered
what
they
had
said
to
each
other
last
night
what
manner
of
man
might
he
be
whose
admiration
would
be
acceptable
to
you
he
had
asked
her
and
she
had
answered
promptly
a
man
quite
your
opposite
in
everything
looking
fixedly
at
ronald
valchester
the
outlaw
beheld
the
man
whom
jaquelina
fancy
had
painted
to
her
heart
before
she
ever
beheld
him
the
one
man
peur
et
sans
whose
admiration
would
be
welcome
to
her
i
will
leave
it
to
you
he
repeated
has
miss
meredith
used
me
fairly
i
decidedly
decline
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subject
replied
ronald
valchester
gravely
and
coldly
there
was
a
moment
silence
very
well
said
the
outlaw
with
a
quiet
bow
then
he
looked
again
at
the
fair
young
face
that
had
caused
his
downfall
miss
meredith
he
said
you
have
repaid
my
kindness
to
you
last
night
with
the
basest
ingratitude
it
was
love
for
your
beautiful
face
that
led
me
here
i
have
lurked
in
the
shadows
for
hours
watching
your
happiness
and
unselfishly
rejoicing
in
your
unclouded
joy
but
your
cruelty
has
awakened
the
sleeping
tiger
in
my
heart
henceforth
beware
the
name
of
gerald
huntington
i
swear
to
you
that
sooner
or
later
i
will
take
a
terrible
revenge
for
this
injury
do
not
be
frightened
at
the
villain
threat
miss
meredith
said
a
gentleman
kindly
as
they
led
the
captive
away
he
will
not
have
the
chance
to
harm
you
they
will
be
sure
to
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
for
life
jaquelina
looked
startled
will
the
punishment
indeed
be
so
severe
she
cried
i
did
not
know
that
i
only
thought
do
not
begin
to
repent
of
your
brave
deed
miss
meredith
cried
walter
earle
gayly
at
her
side
of
course
he
will
go
into
imprisonment
for
life
or
for
a
very
long
term
of
years
certainly
and
deserves
it
too
the
handsome
rascal
then
you
do
not
think
i
acted
wrong
said
jaquelina
almost
piteously
wrong
no
indeed
said
walter
earle
i
think
you
are
a
perfect
little
heroine
so
do
i
and
i
and
i
cried
a
score
of
voices
but
ronald
valchester
whose
opinion
she
longed
to
hear
was
gravely
silent
no
one
could
induce
the
gifted
student
to
utter
his
opinion
on
that
one
subject
whether
or
not
jaquelina
had
treated
gerald
huntington
unfairly
when
asked
about
it
afterward
as
he
often
was
he
distinctly
and
invariably
declined
to
discuss
it
walter
earle
his
dear
friend
could
not
chaff
him
into
betraying
himself
violet
though
she
coaxed
and
teased
bewitchingly
could
not
charm
his
thoughts
from
him
he
kept
his
opinion
to
himself
the
delightful
party
broke
up
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
more
than
half
the
young
men
went
away
with
the
squad
that
guarded
the
prisoner
anxious
to
see
him
placed
in
safe
custody
others
hurried
home
to
carry
their
friends
the
welcome
news
of
the
dreaded
capture
walter
earle
drove
jaquelina
home
in
his
mother
pretty
little
basket
phaeton
meredith
was
awake
and
in
answer
to
his
question
his
niece
told
him
it
had
been
a
pleasant
party
but
she
did
not
tell
him
what
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
hear
namely
that
the
outlaw
chief
had
been
captured
she
went
to
her
room
laid
aside
her
mother
and
put
away
with
the
ring
and
locket
the
withered
that
ronald
valchester
had
gathered
for
her
i
will
keep
the
flowers
in
remembrance
of
she
said
artlessly
it
would
have
been
the
happiest
night
of
my
life
she
added
if
only
a
vague
sigh
followed
the
broken
sentence
chapter
ix
jaquelina
was
lying
at
ease
under
her
favorite
apple
tree
the
next
afternoon
when
the
murmur
of
voices
roused
her
she
lifted
her
head
and
saw
walter
and
violet
earle
with
valchester
i
knew
we
should
find
you
here
said
violet
with
her
soft
laugh
i
have
heard
about
your
pretty
retreat
under
the
apple
trees
she
did
not
say
that
she
had
come
straight
there
feeling
quite
sure
of
catching
jaquelina
at
a
disadvantage
violet
would
not
have
owned
to
herself
that
she
was
prompted
by
a
spiteful
little
feminine
instinct
but
she
gave
ronald
valchester
an
arch
little
smile
that
said
plainer
than
words
did
i
not
tell
you
the
truth
is
not
the
little
beauty
of
last
night
brown
awkward
and
shabby
violet
herself
looked
as
fair
and
pure
as
a
lily
in
her
cool
white
dress
and
white
chip
hat
with
its
delicate
wreath
of
violets
she
had
some
violets
fastened
with
the
lace
at
her
throat
and
they
were
just
the
color
of
her
eyes
she
was
fully
conscious
of
the
pleasant
fact
that
though
jaquelina
had
rivaled
her
last
night
she
had
a
very
decided
advantage
over
her
but
men
never
see
with
woman
eyes
ronald
valchester
only
saw
that
the
skin
was
glowing
with
the
rosy
tint
of
health
that
the
careless
boyish
locks
of
chestnut
hair
had
caught
and
held
some
stray
gleams
of
summer
sunshine
that
the
brown
hands
were
slender
and
delicately
formed
he
noticed
too
that
the
girlish
form
guiltless
of
stays
or
laces
was
very
graceful
with
the
willowy
lightness
and
roundness
so
lovely
in
youth
but
he
never
realized
at
all
until
he
heard
violet
telling
her
mamma
at
tea
that
night
that
poor
lina
meredith
had
on
a
faded
and
darned
calico
and
boots
with
half
the
buttons
gone
jaquelina
had
been
reading
a
book
of
poetry
and
some
of
the
dreaminess
still
lingered
in
her
eyes
as
she
rose
to
greet
her
visitors
a
half
wish
darted
into
her
mind
that
they
had
gone
into
the
house
at
first
that
she
might
have
slipped
into
the
back
way
and
donned
her
sunday
dress
but
no
one
guessed
the
thought
not
even
walter
earle
who
said
with
a
careless
laugh
ah
miss
cinderella
we
have
caught
you
without
your
where
are
your
diamond
ring
and
gold
locket
jaquelina
looked
at
them
a
little
surprised
i
have
put
away
the
ring
and
locket
she
said
i
do
not
wear
them
usually
they
belonged
to
my
mother
then
she
added
a
little
shyly
and
anxiously
will
you
come
into
the
house
and
see
aunt
meredith
thanks
no
answered
violet
promptly
it
is
so
pretty
out
here
in
the
orchard
we
would
rather
stay
she
fluttered
down
to
a
seat
at
the
root
of
the
great
apple
tree
making
a
pretty
picture
with
the
low
boughs
bending
above
her
head
valchester
had
already
taken
a
seat
and
possessed
himself
of
jaquelina
worn
poetry
volume
he
immediately
became
lost
in
its
pages
walter
earle
groaned
what
has
the
got
hold
of
now
he
inquired
violet
moved
a
little
nearer
near
enough
to
look
over
at
the
open
volume
favorite
poems
by
favorite
authors
she
replied
is
that
your
daily
reading
asked
walter
of
jaquelina
yes
she
admitted
are
you
fond
of
poetry
violet
asked
her
yes
she
said
again
demurely
you
should
ask
valchester
to
show
you
his
volume
of
manuscript
poetry
said
walter
laughing
he
is
a
very
untiring
and
voluminous
poet
i
might
say
a
second
byron
valchester
looked
up
flushed
and
confused
evidently
annoyed
he
was
about
to
speak
when
jaquelina
broke
out
reproachfully
oh
valchester
i
asked
you
and
you
denied
it
asked
him
what
cried
walter
enjoying
the
situation
immensely
if
he
was
a
poet
said
jaquelina
breathless
and
he
said
that
no
one
ever
accused
me
of
it
said
valchester
i
confess
to
some
rhymes
miss
meredith
but
to
be
a
poet
a
real
poet
means
more
than
that
miss
lina
it
is
only
modesty
that
makes
him
talk
so
said
walter
laughingly
he
has
written
some
very
readable
rhymes
i
assure
you
miss
meredith
i
hope
you
will
not
give
credence
to
walter
idle
gossip
exclaimed
ronald
valchester
really
distressed
now
it
is
as
i
told
you
just
now
i
have
rhymed
some
i
confess
it
of
course
my
verses
sound
well
to
earle
he
has
not
the
slightest
taste
for
poetry
true
poetry
and
real
doggerel
would
be
alike
to
him
but
the
critics
might
tell
me
to
return
to
your
gallipots
as
they
told
the
laughed
earle
yes
said
valchester
and
returned
to
his
reading
read
aloud
to
us
said
violet
should
you
not
like
that
lina
very
much
she
replied
and
her
dark
eyes
brightened
at
the
thought
then
i
will
read
on
from
where
we
interrupted
you
said
valchester
looking
at
jaquelina
which
poet
was
it
miss
meredith
longfellow
it
was
hiawatha
wooing
she
said
and
blushed
though
she
did
not
know
why
at
violet
laugh
and
you
left
off
where
inquired
valchester
holding
the
open
book
toward
her
jaquelina
leaned
forward
a
moment
turned
a
page
with
her
brown
forefinger
and
showed
him
the
verse
she
did
not
know
why
her
breath
came
quicker
for
an
instant
as
his
white
hand
touched
hers
quite
accidentally
but
violet
earle
saw
the
swift
color
rise
into
her
cheek
it
was
a
beautiful
scene
the
day
was
so
bright
and
golden
the
grass
so
green
the
clover
blossoms
and
the
orchard
blooms
were
so
sweet
and
the
quartette
under
the
apple
tree
were
so
young
and
so
happy
sorrow
had
never
touched
them
with
her
gloomy
finger
it
was
one
of
those
hours
we
frame
in
gold
pictures
to
be
remembered
valchester
read
on
in
his
deep
sweet
voice
that
seemed
to
blend
harmoniously
with
the
warble
of
the
birds
and
the
myriad
sweet
voices
of
nature
pleasant
was
the
journey
homeward
all
the
birds
sang
loud
and
sweetly
songs
of
happiness
and
heart
ease
sang
the
blue
bird
the
owaissa
are
you
hiawatha
having
such
a
wife
to
love
you
sang
the
robin
the
opechee
are
you
minnehaha
having
such
a
noble
husband
from
the
sky
the
sun
benignant
looked
upon
them
through
the
branches
saying
to
them
my
children
love
is
sunshine
hate
is
shadow
life
is
checkered
shade
and
sunshine
rule
by
love
oh
hiawatha
from
the
sky
the
moon
looked
at
them
filled
the
lodge
with
mystic
splendors
whispered
to
them
my
children
day
is
restless
night
is
quiet
man
imperious
woman
feeble
half
is
mine
although
i
follow
rule
by
patience
laughing
water
it
is
very
beautiful
said
valchester
shutting
the
book
and
glancing
round
quickly
so
as
to
catch
the
expression
on
each
face
but
i
will
not
read
anymore
i
see
that
walter
looks
bored
and
miss
earle
as
if
she
would
rather
talk
to
miss
meredith
about
the
party
last
night
i
am
dying
to
ask
her
if
she
enjoyed
it
all
said
violet
piqued
that
he
had
read
her
indifference
to
poetry
yet
carrying
it
off
with
cool
did
you
lina
jaquelina
looked
up
with
a
start
her
dark
eyes
soft
and
dreamy
in
fancy
she
was
still
following
the
young
brave
hiawatha
as
he
bore
his
bride
homeward
through
interminable
forests
over
wide
and
rushing
rivers
oh
yes
it
was
delightful
she
said
and
a
smile
chased
the
momentary
dreaminess
away
i
enjoyed
it
all
very
much
except
perhaps
just
at
the
last
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
enjoyed
that
most
of
all
cried
walter
earle
do
you
know
miss
meredith
that
you
are
quite
a
heroine
all
over
the
country
this
morning
your
presence
of
mind
and
daring
are
on
every
lip
the
farmers
breathe
freely
once
more
you
have
not
only
earned
the
reward
of
two
hundred
dollars
but
you
have
won
the
admiration
and
gratitude
of
all
who
have
heard
of
it
by
morning
you
will
find
yourself
in
all
the
newspapers
will
wake
up
and
find
yourself
famous
quoted
violet
laughing
but
jaquelina
did
not
look
elated
at
their
words
a
shadow
seemed
to
fall
over
the
brightness
of
the
arch
brunette
face
she
glanced
at
ronald
valchester
shyly
his
face
was
perfectly
i
do
not
know
whether
to
be
ashamed
or
proud
she
said
frankly
gerald
huntington
seemed
to
think
i
had
taken
an
unfair
advantage
of
him
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
brooded
so
much
and
so
ardently
over
his
capture
that
i
was
wild
with
delight
at
the
idea
of
its
possibility
i
forgot
gratitude
and
everything
else
in
the
moment
when
i
frantically
clutched
him
forgot
everything
but
the
offered
reward
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
mercenary
lina
said
miss
earle
laughing
jaquelina
looked
abashed
for
a
moment
then
she
answered
without
looking
up
and
almost
pleadingly
you
see
violet
i
needed
two
hundred
dollars
so
very
very
much
for
what
said
careless
thoughtless
walter
to
buy
a
silk
dress
or
a
watch
or
a
pair
of
diamond
earrings
neither
she
answered
half
vexed
half
smiling
i
wanted
it
to
buy
an
education
walter
and
violet
laughed
valchester
looked
surprised
a
moment
then
smiled
a
smile
of
sweet
approval
i
thought
you
were
educated
said
walter
she
was
about
to
reply
when
meredith
shrill
peculiar
call
was
heard
from
the
house
jaquelina
face
faded
in
a
frown
of
shame
and
annoyance
she
rose
with
a
hurried
excuse
and
promising
to
return
went
to
the
house
aunt
meredith
i
have
company
she
said
a
little
impatiently
to
the
woman
in
the
doorway
where
asked
meredith
looking
around
bewildered
out
in
the
orchard
miss
violet
earle
with
her
brother
and
his
friend
said
jaquelina
i
should
like
to
go
back
if
you
can
spare
me
i
spare
you
i
want
you
to
tend
dollie
while
i
run
over
to
brown
on
a
matter
of
business
meredith
said
sharply
can
i
take
dollie
to
the
orchard
with
me
it
is
very
warm
and
sunny
there
said
jaquelina
timidly
yes
take
her
if
you
choose
i
do
care
said
her
aunt
as
she
slipped
on
her
sunbonnet
and
hurried
off
to
a
gossiping
neighbor
chapter
ix
jaquelina
took
the
heavy
child
in
her
arms
and
went
slowly
back
to
the
orchard
that
inevitable
dollie
said
violet
warmly
as
she
saw
her
coming
it
a
shame
that
meredith
does
not
hire
a
nurse
for
that
great
fat
child
i
am
sure
if
i
were
jaquelina
i
would
not
be
forced
to
carry
it
round
it
a
shame
echoed
walter
she
is
so
slender
she
almost
staggers
beneath
its
weight
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
go
and
relieve
her
of
the
burden
it
would
have
seemed
superlatively
ridiculous
for
him
the
gay
handsome
young
dandy
to
have
carried
chubby
little
dollie
meredith
up
the
hill
even
to
save
a
pretty
girl
arms
from
aching
he
was
surprised
and
vexed
when
ronald
valchester
rose
and
sauntered
down
the
grassy
orchard
slope
to
meet
jaquelina
what
is
valchester
up
to
now
he
said
gnawing
the
ends
of
his
fair
mustache
jealously
miss
meredith
said
valchester
with
quiet
courtesy
allow
me
to
carry
the
child
for
you
you
are
not
strong
enough
for
such
a
burden
no
thank
you
she
said
nervously
i
am
quite
accustomed
to
it
you
see
and
but
all
further
remonstrance
was
cut
short
by
valchester
decisive
action
he
took
the
child
gently
but
firmly
from
her
arms
and
walked
up
the
slope
with
it
for
all
the
world
as
violet
rather
acidly
remarked
to
her
brother
like
a
country
booby
going
to
meeting
with
his
wife
and
child
val
i
only
wish
that
millard
could
get
a
glimpse
of
you
now
called
out
walter
laughing
who
is
millard
violet
queried
oh
one
of
our
an
artist
of
no
mean
merit
either
how
delightfully
he
would
caricature
valchester
appearance
now
valchester
did
not
seem
disturbed
by
the
playful
hit
he
sat
dollie
down
in
the
long
grass
and
filled
her
fat
little
hands
with
clover
heads
jaquelina
sat
down
beside
her
apprehensive
that
she
would
cram
the
blossoms
into
her
mouth
and
choke
herself
and
you
will
spend
the
two
hundred
dollars
reward
you
will
receive
for
the
capture
of
the
outlaw
chief
on
your
education
miss
lina
said
walter
resuming
the
conversation
where
it
had
been
interrupted
by
the
curt
summons
of
dollie
mother
yes
jaquelina
answered
simply
and
then
said
walter
earle
then
she
answered
hopefully
and
a
little
eagerly
i
hope
i
shall
leave
the
farm
and
earn
my
own
living
somewhere
i
am
ambitious
of
becoming
a
governess
a
vaulting
ambition
said
violet
with
a
light
laugh
not
very
said
lina
with
a
gentle
innocence
and
gravity
that
checked
violet
delicate
sarcasm
it
will
be
better
than
the
farm
that
is
all
valchester
here
is
a
clover
for
you
said
violet
take
it
and
keep
it
it
may
bring
you
good
luck
thank
you
he
said
and
took
it
carelessly
and
held
it
between
his
long
white
fingers
a
little
later
when
no
one
was
looking
he
shut
it
inside
the
leaves
of
jaquelina
book
you
have
given
the
clover
to
one
who
could
not
appreciate
good
luck
if
it
came
to
him
laughed
walter
valchester
has
known
nothing
else
all
his
life
he
is
fortune
favorite
i
think
you
are
too
earle
you
and
violet
jaquelina
said
gently
a
faint
sigh
quivered
over
her
lips
as
she
spoke
she
looked
at
these
three
in
their
costly
apparel
and
with
their
bright
happy
faces
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
they
belonged
to
quite
a
different
world
from
her
own
they
were
fortune
favorites
all
of
them
thank
you
said
walter
smiling
i
hope
the
fickle
goddess
will
always
be
kind
to
me
then
violet
rose
shaking
out
the
apple
blossoms
that
had
fallen
into
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
declared
it
was
time
to
go
we
came
to
ask
you
to
go
boating
with
us
said
walter
but
i
suppose
with
anything
but
a
loving
glance
at
innocent
dollie
it
would
be
no
use
jaquelina
eyes
brightened
then
saddened
again
almost
pathetically
no
for
aunt
meredith
has
gone
away
she
said
i
could
not
go
in
her
keen
disappointment
she
was
quite
unconscious
how
much
pathetic
emphasis
she
laid
upon
then
said
walter
instantly
could
you
not
slip
away
from
that
terrible
dollie
she
looked
at
him
her
eyes
shining
her
lips
trembling
with
pleasure
yes
if
you
went
at
noon
she
said
if
later
no
why
not
later
asked
violet
curiously
because
i
must
help
with
the
milking
then
she
answered
simply
we
will
go
at
noon
then
said
walter
at
once
we
will
call
for
you
punctually
and
you
must
be
ready
young
ladies
are
never
ready
when
called
for
said
ronald
valchester
with
his
slight
smile
i
will
prove
the
exception
to
the
rule
jaquelina
answered
brightly
while
violet
said
to
herself
in
wonder
in
the
world
will
she
wear
i
wonder
why
mamma
insists
upon
having
us
patronize
jaquelina
meredith
she
is
not
in
our
set
and
she
has
a
decent
thing
to
wear
it
is
strange
she
does
have
the
good
sense
to
understand
it
herself
and
decline
our
invitations
violet
said
the
same
to
herself
the
next
day
when
she
went
upon
the
river
violet
had
on
a
lovely
of
blue
serge
and
a
leghorn
sailor
hat
set
coquettishly
on
her
golden
locks
jaquelina
wore
her
simple
calico
dress
with
a
white
ruffled
apron
tied
about
the
slim
round
waist
for
all
the
world
as
miss
violet
said
to
herself
pityingly
and
like
a
she
had
caught
up
an
old
straw
hat
of
her
uncle
and
fastened
it
on
her
head
with
a
strip
of
velvet
ribbon
passed
over
the
top
and
tied
beneath
her
chin
it
looked
quaint
and
picturesque
and
a
more
charming
face
than
the
one
it
framed
could
not
have
been
imagined
the
bright
dark
eyes
curtained
by
such
inky
sweeping
lashes
would
in
themselves
alone
have
made
a
plain
face
beautiful
but
jaquelina
had
delicate
features
and
lovely
scarlet
lips
parting
over
small
regular
white
teeth
no
amount
of
shabby
dressing
could
have
made
her
a
fright
or
a
dowdy
with
that
radiant
face
the
tint
acquired
by
the
too
ardent
kisses
of
the
wind
and
sun
marred
it
a
little
but
the
soft
rich
color
in
her
cheeks
almost
atoned
for
the
fault
it
was
a
lovely
day
and
a
lovely
river
the
bending
trees
overhung
the
green
flowery
banks
and
threw
their
long
grateful
shadows
across
the
sunny
water
it
was
so
clear
you
could
see
the
pebbles
in
the
bottom
and
the
silvery
little
fish
darting
to
and
fro
walter
and
valchester
took
turns
in
rowing
sometimes
they
would
suffer
the
boat
to
drift
at
its
will
while
they
chattered
and
laughed
in
the
gay
thoughtlessness
of
youth
long
afterward
when
winter
was
in
the
sky
and
the
clouds
of
sorrow
overhung
their
lives
they
looked
back
upon
these
two
days
this
one
upon
the
river
and
yesterday
beneath
the
blossoming
as
golden
days
that
were
like
beautiful
pictures
set
in
their
memory
the
next
day
walter
earle
and
his
friend
went
back
to
the
university
walter
earle
had
talked
a
great
deal
about
jaquelina
meredith
since
the
night
of
the
he
saw
that
his
mother
was
not
displeased
at
his
admiration
of
the
lovely
orphan
girl
i
admire
miss
meredith
very
much
he
said
in
his
frank
way
i
think
she
is
very
beautiful
do
not
you
val
she
is
fascinating
said
ronald
valchester
violet
looked
up
quickly
fascinating
she
said
what
do
you
mean
by
that
valchester
i
do
not
exactly
comprehend
is
it
more
or
less
than
beauty
i
think
it
is
more
he
replied
more
said
violet
what
could
be
better
than
beauty
mr
valchester
the
power
to
win
said
valchester
i
have
seen
some
very
beautiful
women
whom
i
did
not
admire
they
lacked
that
ne
sais
which
is
so
strong
in
miss
meredith
that
i
could
fancy
one
might
even
admire
her
against
his
will
you
mean
the
charm
of
the
serpent
said
violet
innocently
no
i
did
not
mean
that
in
the
least
said
valchester
he
bit
his
lip
as
if
the
suggestion
did
not
please
him
there
is
nothing
about
miss
meredith
she
seems
a
gentle
girl
but
i
do
not
believe
i
could
quite
define
my
impressions
abruptly
will
you
excuse
me
from
trying
certainly
she
answered
carelessly
to
hide
a
certain
girlish
pique
while
walter
said
gaily
you
are
too
dignified
to
get
down
to
the
level
of
understanding
val
let
me
explain
he
means
in
college
parlance
sis
that
miss
meredith
has
a
taking
way
with
her
thank
you
i
quite
understand
said
violet
with
dignity
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
the
subject
was
not
resumed
there
had
been
some
talk
of
their
going
over
to
the
farm
to
bid
miss
meredith
adieu
but
the
project
was
tacitly
dropped
they
returned
to
college
that
night
but
without
seeing
jaquelina
one
week
afterward
a
huge
box
of
books
was
forwarded
to
the
girl
over
which
she
went
almost
wild
with
joy
all
the
best
of
the
poets
ancient
and
modern
were
there
in
fine
and
elegant
bindings
and
profusely
illustrated
in
the
first
volume
she
opened
was
a
card
the
compliments
of
ronald
valchester
jaquelina
studied
the
beautiful
chirography
of
the
student
admiringly
for
awhile
then
she
laid
it
away
with
the
withered
in
the
box
with
her
dead
mother
jewelry
after
several
days
of
passionate
delight
over
the
books
jaquelina
remembered
that
she
had
not
thanked
the
sender
soon
afterward
a
little
white
note
found
its
way
to
the
university
ronald
valchester
read
the
few
lines
it
contained
many
times
but
he
must
have
forgotten
to
show
it
to
walter
earle
for
the
latter
never
heard
of
it
valchester
a
thousand
thanks
for
the
books
you
have
made
me
very
happy
jaquelina
meredith
that
was
all
she
said
but
it
pleased
ronald
valchester
though
the
university
students
unanimously
agreed
that
he
was
hard
to
please
and
fastidious
to
a
fault
the
note
was
in
a
clear
refined
hand
it
pleased
his
whim
to
put
it
away
carefully
there
was
one
thing
ronald
valchester
did
not
like
it
was
to
read
in
the
newspapers
the
glowing
accounts
of
the
outlaw
capture
by
a
young
girl
the
students
were
all
quite
wild
over
it
walter
earle
had
described
it
to
them
in
the
most
enthusiastic
terms
and
they
would
have
liked
nothing
so
well
as
to
meet
the
young
heroine
but
ronald
valchester
was
exceedingly
sorry
that
the
story
had
gotten
into
the
papers
after
awhile
the
newspapers
chronicled
the
fact
that
gerald
huntington
had
been
tried
and
convicted
and
that
his
counsel
had
obtained
a
new
hearing
in
his
case
but
it
was
thought
that
he
could
not
escape
being
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
a
long
term
of
years
it
was
feared
by
many
that
the
virginians
would
mob
him
the
months
flew
swiftly
past
at
the
close
of
the
college
session
walter
earle
and
ronald
valchester
both
graduated
with
distinguished
honors
after
they
separated
each
to
their
homes
walter
wrote
to
his
friend
that
jaquelina
meredith
had
received
the
reward
of
two
hundred
dollars
for
gerald
huntington
capture
and
that
she
had
gone
away
to
enter
a
at
staunton
but
i
have
found
out
several
pretty
girls
in
the
neighborhood
wrote
walter
so
i
am
trying
to
console
myself
for
pretty
lina
absence
by
the
way
violet
is
visiting
the
claxtons
in
your
city
give
my
love
to
her
if
you
see
her
chapter
x
there
was
another
lawn
party
at
laurel
hill
again
the
band
was
playing
in
the
on
the
lawn
light
feet
kept
time
to
the
merry
dance
lights
glimmered
in
the
trees
and
the
scene
was
like
more
than
a
year
had
passed
since
the
last
party
the
orchards
had
bloomed
again
and
dropped
their
scented
red
and
white
blossoms
the
boughs
hung
low
with
gold
and
crimson
globes
of
fair
white
fruit
the
timid
tender
spring
flowers
were
gone
and
summer
glowing
beauties
reigned
instead
since
walter
earle
had
graduated
he
and
violet
had
been
traveling
in
the
south
with
a
party
of
friends
they
had
returned
now
and
this
reception
to
their
young
friends
had
been
planned
and
carried
out
with
a
great
deal
of
interest
and
pleasure
it
was
a
far
more
pretentious
affair
than
the
almost
impromptu
one
of
last
year
several
persons
had
come
from
a
distance
to
attend
it
among
the
latter
was
ronald
valchester
jaquelina
meredith
fresh
from
her
school
at
staunton
was
there
also
violet
had
feebly
opposed
an
invitation
to
her
at
first
but
her
mother
and
walter
had
promptly
overruled
her
embarrassed
objections
my
dear
earle
had
said
in
some
surprise
why
do
you
object
to
lina
meredith
do
you
not
like
her
pretty
violet
grown
taller
and
even
more
stylish
than
of
old
flushed
and
looked
annoyed
lina
is
not
in
our
set
she
said
and
she
is
too
poor
to
get
a
party
dress
of
course
she
could
not
come
without
one
she
had
the
prettiest
dress
at
the
party
last
year
said
walter
warmly
that
is
all
you
know
about
it
said
violet
laughingly
it
was
her
mother
she
had
not
a
decent
thing
of
her
own
she
can
wear
her
mother
dress
again
said
earle
and
her
son
simultaneously
and
earle
added
almost
pleadingly
do
let
her
come
violet
she
is
so
young
and
pretty
and
would
enjoy
it
so
much
and
she
has
so
few
pleasures
said
walter
with
commendable
forethought
for
such
a
giddy
young
man
oh
she
can
come
certainly
violet
answered
coldly
only
i
thought
she
would
not
care
to
come
unless
she
could
appear
as
others
do
last
year
she
was
quite
ignorant
she
did
not
know
anything
about
society
but
now
that
she
has
spent
a
year
at
she
knows
of
course
that
a
girl
is
next
to
nobody
invite
her
if
you
like
i
only
wished
to
spare
her
feelings
i
think
we
should
spare
her
feelings
better
by
asking
than
by
leaving
her
out
replied
gentle
earle
so
the
orphan
girl
was
asked
and
meredith
came
again
and
brought
her
as
before
and
violet
was
mistaken
this
time
for
jaquelina
had
really
something
to
wear
this
time
it
was
a
pretty
robe
of
some
soft
thin
stuff
and
shining
in
the
moonlight
the
neck
was
cut
square
and
edged
with
some
soft
pretty
lace
the
sleeves
were
short
and
exposed
the
perfectly
molded
arms
jaquelina
had
brightened
it
here
and
there
with
a
few
vivid
scarlet
roses
and
the
effect
was
exquisite
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
lamps
and
the
softer
gleam
of
the
moonlight
the
slight
and
graceful
form
seemed
to
float
in
a
robe
of
silvery
mist
violet
in
pale
blue
satin
and
pearls
felt
eclipsed
and
resentful
again
as
she
had
done
at
the
lawn
party
a
year
before
lina
where
you
get
such
a
pretty
dress
she
asked
her
unceremoniously
is
it
pretty
asked
jaquelina
pleased
i
bought
it
at
staunton
to
wear
at
one
of
our
school
concerts
where
i
had
to
sing
a
part
you
sing
asked
violet
incredulous
a
little
admitted
jaquelina
modestly
and
play
said
violet
and
again
jaquelina
answered
shyly
a
little
only
the
accompaniments
to
my
songs
you
know
violet
then
i
shall
be
certain
to
call
on
you
to
sing
and
play
and
you
must
not
refuse
said
violet
smiling
to
herself
at
the
idea
of
the
singing
and
playing
jaquelina
could
have
acquired
in
a
year
she
did
not
look
frightened
at
violet
words
she
simply
said
that
she
would
do
her
best
violet
had
no
idea
what
that
best
meant
valchester
is
here
she
said
after
a
pause
with
a
keen
glance
at
the
other
he
came
yesterday
on
purpose
to
attend
our
party
but
you
have
totally
forgotten
him
i
suppose
turning
her
head
a
little
sidewise
oh
no
i
remember
him
perfectly
well
said
jaquelina
unembarrassed
do
you
you
have
a
good
memory
i
believe
you
only
saw
him
once
or
twice
three
times
jaquelina
answered
i
do
not
believe
he
has
remembered
so
well
said
violet
arranging
her
bracelets
when
some
one
named
you
this
morning
at
breakfast
he
did
not
speak
of
you
nor
ask
any
questions
he
appeared
calm
and
uninterested
as
if
you
were
a
stranger
he
has
probably
forgotten
me
said
jaquelina
quietly
and
violet
could
not
see
any
change
in
the
charming
face
as
she
spoke
the
careless
words
she
had
changed
somewhat
since
she
had
been
away
and
acquired
a
touch
more
of
the
grave
pretty
dignity
that
had
always
seemed
so
natural
to
her
there
was
a
minute
pause
while
they
stood
together
beneath
the
arched
lattice
work
of
honeysuckle
and
roses
like
a
beautiful
picture
of
night
and
morning
the
one
with
her
fair
blonde
beauty
and
pale
blue
robe
the
other
in
her
soft
gray
draperies
and
dusky
eyes
with
that
starry
gleam
in
their
darkness
that
thought
came
into
the
mind
of
the
gentleman
who
came
up
to
them
from
a
almost
abruptly
it
was
ronald
valchester
miss
earle
he
said
i
think
you
promised
to
give
me
the
first
dance
i
am
ready
to
keep
my
word
answered
violet
with
a
brilliant
smile
then
she
saw
that
the
eyes
were
gazing
intently
at
her
silent
companion
oh
valchester
she
cried
i
see
you
have
forgotten
lina
meredith
she
was
at
our
party
last
summer
and
went
boating
on
the
river
with
us
one
day
do
you
remember
some
pretty
lines
somewhere
read
rushed
into
his
mind
jaquelina
embodied
the
thought
sweet
face
swift
eyes
and
gleaming
mingling
hair
lips
like
two
rosebuds
dreaming
in
june
air
life
when
her
spring
days
meet
her
hope
when
the
angels
greet
her
is
not
more
calm
nor
sweeter
and
love
is
not
more
fair
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
stepped
forward
with
extended
hand
miss
meredith
is
it
really
you
he
said
you
must
pardon
me
that
i
did
not
recognize
you
on
the
instant
i
had
not
forgotten
you
but
you
have
changed
she
gave
him
her
slim
hand
a
moment
and
would
have
spoken
but
violet
seemed
impatient
and
tapped
her
daintily
slippered
foot
restlessly
i
hear
the
first
notes
of
the
band
she
said
if
we
do
not
hasten
they
will
make
up
the
dance
without
me
valchester
bowed
and
offered
her
his
arm
just
as
walter
earle
came
hurrying
up
miss
lina
will
you
give
me
the
first
dance
he
said
you
owe
it
to
me
indeed
for
i
taught
you
your
first
steps
last
year
do
you
remember
as
though
it
were
yesterday
she
replied
with
a
smile
as
she
put
her
slight
hand
on
his
arm
in
the
whirl
of
the
dance
valchester
bent
his
tall
head
over
her
a
moment
to
ask
almost
pleadingly
will
you
give
me
the
next
dance
miss
meredith
yes
she
answered
as
their
hands
met
a
moment
in
the
giddy
turn
she
did
not
guess
how
long
it
seemed
to
valchester
before
the
next
dance
came
walter
earle
took
her
to
her
seat
and
lingered
beside
her
until
his
friend
availed
himself
of
the
first
notes
of
the
music
to
come
and
lead
her
away
i
hoped
she
had
not
a
partner
for
this
dance
cried
walter
dolorously
i
meant
to
sit
here
and
talk
sentiment
to
her
i
shall
regret
that
i
taught
her
the
steps
since
you
fellows
continually
take
her
away
from
me
i
will
sit
by
you
walter
said
his
sister
coming
to
his
side
there
was
a
smile
on
her
face
but
her
voice
sounded
sad
or
troubled
somehow
what
not
dancing
he
said
surprised
not
this
time
i
am
tired
and
would
rather
rest
she
answered
she
sat
down
by
his
side
and
laid
her
white
jeweled
hand
on
his
arm
walter
are
you
in
love
with
lina
meredith
she
asked
him
very
low
walter
started
and
flushed
that
a
leading
question
rather
he
said
well
violet
i
certainly
admire
her
i
have
never
seen
a
more
charming
little
girl
in
my
life
is
ronald
valchester
in
love
with
her
too
pursued
violet
looking
away
from
him
that
he
might
not
see
how
much
pain
the
question
had
brought
into
her
eyes
walter
laughed
at
the
question
valchester
in
love
he
said
the
idea
is
too
supremely
ridiculous
to
be
entertained
what
put
such
an
idea
in
your
head
vi
i
do
know
she
said
yes
i
do
too
last
summer
you
know
he
said
she
was
so
fascinating
so
he
did
and
so
she
is
said
her
brother
but
in
love
valchester
is
too
devoted
to
his
books
and
his
esthetic
fancies
to
fall
in
love
with
anything
less
ethereal
than
the
muse
of
poetry
if
you
are
in
love
with
lina
meredith
why
do
you
propose
to
her
and
have
the
matter
settled
she
asked
petulantly
i
did
know
you
were
anxious
to
have
lina
meredith
for
a
sister
said
walter
staring
i
should
be
very
pleased
said
violet
desperately
and
she
spoke
the
truth
she
knew
that
jaquelina
was
good
and
pretty
she
had
nothing
against
her
except
her
vague
jealousy
of
ronald
valchester
if
you
mean
to
propose
for
her
pray
do
so
at
once
and
let
us
have
the
wedding
this
fall
said
violet
with
feverish
impatience
meanwhile
jaquelina
partner
with
his
tall
head
bent
over
her
was
saying
i
had
not
forgotten
you
miss
meredith
though
i
seemed
startled
for
the
moment
did
you
think
i
had
the
dark
eyes
looked
at
him
in
smiling
gratitude
i
know
that
you
remembered
me
kindly
once
at
least
she
replied
it
was
when
you
sent
me
the
books
oh
i
could
not
tell
you
how
much
i
enjoyed
them
valchester
you
can
not
imagine
what
happiness
they
gave
me
i
could
never
thank
you
enough
for
your
kindness
if
you
remembered
me
kindly
a
few
times
it
was
quite
sufficient
he
said
did
you
lina
did
i
said
the
girl
with
a
keen
shiver
of
some
indefinable
emotion
as
the
low
name
passed
his
lips
think
of
me
he
answered
looking
straight
into
her
dark
uplifted
eyes
often
and
often
she
responded
with
frank
gravity
you
see
i
had
the
beautiful
books
to
recall
you
to
my
mind
every
day
then
one
day
when
i
was
looking
through
the
book
you
read
in
the
orchard
i
found
what
he
asked
as
she
paused
with
a
pleased
smile
on
her
scarlet
lips
i
found
on
one
page
a
pressed
clover
i
remembered
that
violet
had
given
you
one
that
day
and
i
was
so
pleased
she
said
pleased
why
asked
ronald
valchester
that
you
had
given
it
to
me
she
answered
you
are
not
superstitious
enough
to
believe
that
the
clover
brings
good
luck
he
said
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
in
his
eyes
oh
no
she
answered
with
frank
innocence
i
was
pleased
because
i
thought
it
seemed
a
silent
message
from
you
to
me
to
say
that
you
wish
me
well
chapter
xi
ronald
valchester
was
a
fine
musician
and
had
a
beautiful
voice
no
one
would
sing
or
play
after
him
usually
the
contrast
was
too
great
perhaps
it
was
for
that
very
reason
that
violet
asked
jaquelina
to
play
directly
after
valchester
had
vacated
the
after
singing
an
exquisite
air
from
a
favorite
opera
for
a
moment
jaquelina
seemed
tempted
to
refuse
the
warm
color
rose
into
her
cheek
as
they
all
looked
at
her
her
scarlet
lips
trembled
but
violet
said
quickly
you
must
not
refuse
lina
we
have
all
played
now
but
you
and
it
would
not
be
fair
for
you
to
decline
allow
me
said
walter
earle
gently
leading
her
to
the
piano
was
it
any
wonder
if
a
faint
thrill
of
pleasure
and
triumph
swelled
the
girl
heart
as
her
white
hands
fluttered
lovingly
over
the
pearl
keys
she
remembered
last
year
how
ashamed
she
had
felt
that
she
could
not
play
how
the
young
girls
had
looked
at
her
pityingly
and
she
vaguely
fancied
disdainfully
because
she
knew
so
little
they
did
not
know
how
hard
she
had
practiced
since
everyone
was
surprised
that
she
should
try
after
ronald
valchester
he
himself
looked
at
her
a
little
uneasily
everyone
expected
a
failure
walter
earle
opened
the
portfolio
of
music
and
held
it
open
before
her
but
she
shook
her
head
no
i
will
play
something
from
memory
she
said
now
i
know
she
will
make
a
failure
violet
said
to
herself
for
my
always
told
me
never
to
play
without
my
notes
before
me
but
violet
made
no
allowance
for
genius
which
acknowledges
no
law
and
is
sufficient
unto
itself
jaquelina
touched
a
key
or
two
softly
so
that
the
sound
seemed
to
be
the
answer
to
a
caress
then
her
hands
began
to
fly
across
the
keys
like
birds
people
looked
at
each
other
the
magic
power
of
genius
was
in
those
slender
fingers
sweeping
the
swift
and
silver
chords
in
a
moment
she
began
to
sing
she
had
chosen
the
pretty
familiar
ballad
of
annie
laurie
not
one
in
the
room
but
knew
that
only
a
powerful
and
voice
could
do
justice
to
the
melodious
but
difficult
strain
but
jaquelina
voice
clear
and
fresh
as
a
nightingale
soared
upward
without
the
least
apparent
effort
the
sweet
pathetic
ballad
was
rendered
exquisitely
there
was
a
perfect
hush
throughout
the
room
until
it
ended
then
they
crowded
around
her
another
and
another
and
another
they
pleaded
when
she
would
have
risen
it
was
violet
at
last
who
brought
it
to
an
end
by
saying
carelessly
let
us
go
back
to
the
dancing
now
we
can
have
music
every
day
but
dancing
only
now
and
then
thank
you
said
a
low
voice
over
jaquelina
shoulder
as
she
was
passing
out
of
the
door
she
looked
back
and
saw
ronald
face
looking
down
at
her
with
bright
shining
eyes
you
have
given
me
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
he
said
i
am
very
glad
she
replied
and
the
next
moment
she
scarcely
knew
how
it
happened
he
was
walking
by
her
side
and
her
hand
was
resting
on
his
arm
they
went
out
upon
the
lawn
and
down
the
laurel
walk
instead
of
dancing
will
you
give
me
this
he
had
said
to
her
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
about
this
beautiful
treasure
you
have
possessed
so
long
unknown
to
us
all
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
as
they
wandered
along
the
path
beneath
the
whispering
laurels
your
voice
he
said
do
you
know
miss
meredith
that
it
is
really
marvelous
i
can
not
tell
you
how
it
has
surprised
and
delighted
me
and
again
she
said
simply
as
before
i
am
glad
he
looked
at
the
lovely
young
face
and
saw
that
she
was
pleased
but
not
at
all
surprised
someone
has
told
you
this
before
he
said
quickly
i
am
not
the
first
to
lay
a
laurel
at
your
feet
in
the
soft
light
he
saw
the
color
deepen
in
her
cheeks
and
the
lashes
droop
low
my
teachers
have
told
me
that
my
voice
was
fine
she
said
quietly
and
and
i
have
sung
in
a
few
times
the
people
praised
me
then
it
is
no
wonder
you
were
not
afraid
to
sing
after
me
he
said
i
was
afraid
for
you
at
first
you
see
i
have
practised
for
many
years
and
people
think
me
a
better
performer
than
the
most
but
i
own
that
my
light
has
paled
before
a
brighter
star
you
must
not
say
so
she
said
quickly
i
have
only
had
a
few
training
my
voice
is
not
at
all
cultivated
it
is
naturally
superb
he
answered
i
have
heard
voices
in
opera
that
were
no
sweeter
than
yours
and
yet
they
were
whom
all
the
world
praised
perhaps
you
have
heard
that
too
before
my
teacher
told
me
i
might
successfully
choose
an
operatic
career
she
answered
quietly
yet
with
a
sigh
whose
meaning
he
did
not
understand
i
hope
you
will
not
do
so
he
answered
quickly
i
have
always
so
much
disliked
the
idea
of
a
public
life
for
a
woman
we
talked
of
that
at
school
she
replied
but
our
singing
master
thought
quite
differently
he
declared
that
a
really
fine
voice
actually
belonged
to
the
world
shall
you
return
to
the
school
this
winter
no
with
a
quickly
suppressed
sigh
you
have
wearied
of
it
perhaps
he
said
no
she
said
again
then
with
a
deepening
color
i
have
spent
all
my
money
that
is
the
reason
have
you
forgotten
valchester
that
all
the
money
i
had
was
the
reward
i
received
for
capturing
the
outlaw
chief
the
soft
eyes
raised
to
his
face
saw
a
shadow
fall
over
its
handsome
contour
i
i
had
been
trying
to
forget
all
about
him
he
said
constrainedly
what
have
they
done
with
the
fellow
miss
meredith
he
is
still
confined
in
the
county
jail
i
believe
she
replied
his
counsel
have
been
using
every
possible
means
to
defer
the
new
hearing
of
the
case
which
was
asked
for
and
promised
uncle
meredith
says
they
are
waiting
for
popular
indignation
to
abate
in
hope
of
obtaining
a
more
lenient
verdict
very
likely
said
ronald
valchester
and
then
there
was
a
constrained
silence
jaquelina
broke
it
herself
in
a
voice
that
was
slightly
tremulous
i
am
afraid
i
did
not
do
right
that
night
valchester
i
did
not
think
as
i
have
since
done
that
it
was
not
a
fair
return
for
his
kindness
to
me
for
he
was
kind
kinder
than
any
one
knew
the
pretty
penitence
in
her
face
touched
him
but
he
did
not
speak
i
have
puzzled
over
it
often
and
often
she
went
on
slowly
and
thoughtfully
i
have
asked
myself
whether
my
private
obligation
to
him
should
have
outweighed
the
good
of
the
country
at
large
i
have
never
been
able
to
satisfy
myself
tell
me
valchester
did
i
do
right
or
not
miss
meredith
he
answered
many
persons
have
asked
me
the
same
question
but
i
have
never
given
my
opinion
to
anyone
then
of
course
you
will
not
tell
me
she
said
disappointed
yet
far
too
shy
to
insist
upon
it
no
i
will
not
now
i
may
do
so
at
some
future
time
evasively
do
you
think
she
said
just
a
trifle
nervously
it
was
worth
while
to
attach
any
meaning
to
his
threat
of
vengeance
sometimes
i
have
felt
afraid
i
should
not
give
it
a
thought
he
replied
it
is
not
probable
he
will
ever
have
the
chance
to
harm
you
even
if
he
wished
it
no
doubt
the
best
part
of
his
life
will
be
passed
in
a
prison
cell
oh
i
hope
not
the
girl
cried
out
in
irrepressible
sorrow
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
i
have
been
the
cause
of
depriving
anyone
of
liberty
i
did
not
think
of
all
these
things
in
the
fatal
moment
when
i
saw
him
peering
at
me
behind
that
laurel
there
now
i
feel
as
if
i
had
betrayed
a
human
being
to
endless
pain
for
a
paltry
two
hundred
dollars
ronald
valchester
looked
before
him
silently
at
the
weird
flickering
shadows
on
the
graveled
path
and
made
no
reply
but
i
wanted
the
money
so
very
very
much
she
added
appealingly
valchester
looked
down
at
the
slim
white
hand
lying
on
his
black
coat
sleeve
the
taper
forefinger
sparkling
with
one
great
gem
of
globed
dew
the
moon
shot
crystal
arrows
through
did
you
never
think
of
parting
with
your
diamond
ring
he
said
abruptly
lifting
her
wondering
gaze
to
his
she
saw
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
mother
ring
she
drew
her
hand
from
his
arm
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
a
hundred
shimmering
rays
flashed
on
the
jewel
you
do
not
mean
that
it
is
really
a
she
cried
with
sparkling
eyes
did
you
not
know
it
he
asked
surprised
i
thought
it
was
only
a
pretty
shining
bit
of
glass
she
answered
is
it
really
and
truly
a
genuine
diamond
and
worth
how
much
he
took
the
warm
pretty
hand
in
his
on
pretense
of
examining
the
ring
at
that
touch
a
quick
electric
thrill
ran
from
heart
to
heart
oh
girls
here
she
is
cried
violet
earle
voice
at
that
moment
in
a
tone
of
apparent
gaiety
what
a
pretty
tableau
flirting
with
valchester
under
the
laurels
chapter
xii
ronald
valchester
looked
round
slightly
annoyed
as
violet
earle
and
a
gay
group
of
girls
came
up
to
him
one
should
never
contradict
a
lady
he
said
but
really
miss
earle
your
charge
against
miss
meredith
is
misplaced
i
was
only
examining
her
ring
and
only
think
violet
valchester
says
the
stone
is
a
real
diamond
i
am
so
surprised
and
delighted
i
did
not
dream
of
such
a
thing
until
just
now
when
he
spoke
of
it
i
thought
it
only
a
mere
valueless
bit
of
shining
glass
the
eager
voice
and
pleased
face
were
too
truthful
to
admit
of
doubt
everyone
but
violet
gave
up
the
thought
of
a
flirtation
at
once
the
girls
crowded
round
to
look
at
jaquelina
ring
where
did
you
get
it
who
gave
it
you
were
some
of
the
questions
they
asked
her
it
was
my
mother
ring
she
said
in
answer
to
them
all
i
did
not
know
till
valchester
told
me
that
it
was
a
real
diamond
i
suppose
it
is
worth
a
great
deal
one
of
the
girls
said
to
him
a
hundred
dollars
perhaps
or
it
may
be
a
hundred
and
fifty
he
replied
carelessly
while
jaquelina
drew
a
long
breath
of
surprise
and
delight
a
hundred
dollars
seemed
quite
a
little
fortune
in
her
eyes
she
looked
at
the
pretty
ring
in
awe
and
wonder
to
think
that
she
had
possessed
it
so
long
without
dreaming
of
its
value
we
need
you
to
make
up
the
dance
lina
said
violet
the
hamiltons
the
perrys
and
the
deanes
have
all
gone
home
and
we
have
not
enough
for
the
lancers
unless
you
and
valchester
will
come
to
our
assistance
will
you
both
answered
yes
and
went
with
the
girls
to
take
their
places
in
the
dance
before
the
party
was
over
he
had
said
to
her
may
i
come
over
and
hear
you
sing
afternoon
under
the
yes
she
answered
simply
he
came
alone
it
must
have
required
an
amount
of
and
strategy
for
him
to
get
away
from
walter
and
violet
but
he
accomplished
it
jaquelina
was
waiting
for
him
under
the
her
heart
thrilled
with
a
strange
pleasure
as
she
saw
the
tall
handsome
young
man
coming
toward
her
she
wore
in
anticipation
of
his
coming
a
pretty
inexpensive
cambric
with
a
pattern
of
tiny
and
a
delicate
lace
frill
fastened
at
her
throat
with
a
cluster
of
roses
he
saw
that
she
had
grown
more
delicately
lovely
since
last
year
the
tanned
complexion
had
acquired
a
mellow
creamy
fairness
the
short
soft
rings
of
hair
were
longer
and
clustered
on
her
shoulders
in
shining
luxuriance
the
crimson
lips
had
taken
a
softer
tender
curve
the
dark
eyes
had
grown
dreamy
and
thoughtful
you
came
she
said
and
there
was
an
accent
of
surprise
in
her
voice
yes
i
preferred
it
are
you
disappointed
that
walter
and
violet
did
not
accompany
me
he
inquired
jaquelina
answered
no
with
pretty
frankness
and
an
utter
lack
of
that
was
very
charming
i
dare
say
they
would
think
me
very
selfish
if
they
knew
i
had
come
over
to
the
farm
alone
he
said
i
slipped
away
from
them
i
am
very
selfish
sometimes
i
want
you
to
sing
your
pretty
songs
to
an
audience
of
one
i
am
quite
willing
she
replied
happily
she
sang
several
songs
for
him
pouring
out
the
exquisite
melodies
clearly
and
artlessly
as
a
bird
ronald
said
to
himself
that
it
was
wonderful
what
a
voice
the
girl
had
so
strong
and
sweet
and
clear
that
she
made
him
think
of
shelley
pouring
his
full
heart
in
profuse
strains
of
unpremeditated
art
he
remained
with
her
fully
two
hours
it
did
not
seem
to
him
so
long
the
time
went
very
fast
looking
at
that
fair
face
and
listening
to
that
musical
voice
for
a
wonder
meredith
did
not
call
her
to
the
house
for
anything
dollie
had
grown
large
enough
to
walk
and
run
alone
and
did
not
need
so
much
attention
is
it
true
that
you
are
going
to
become
a
governess
he
said
to
her
violet
earle
told
me
so
this
morning
yes
if
i
can
find
a
situation
she
replied
do
you
think
i
shall
be
likely
to
find
one
mr
valchester
there
was
a
wistful
anxiety
in
the
sweet
voice
he
looked
at
the
fair
young
face
thoughtfully
a
slanting
ray
of
sunlight
pierced
the
green
boughs
of
the
tree
and
penciled
her
white
brow
with
a
finger
of
light
that
brought
out
its
innocence
more
clearly
no
i
hardly
think
you
will
be
successful
he
replied
you
do
not
she
said
and
he
saw
the
red
lips
quiver
why
not
valchester
i
have
studied
very
hard
and
learned
a
great
deal
since
i
have
been
away
at
school
you
look
too
young
he
replied
no
one
would
like
to
engage
one
who
appeared
so
childish
you
look
too
inexperienced
do
you
really
think
that
would
weigh
against
me
she
asked
distressed
i
assure
you
my
looks
are
very
deceptive
i
am
eighteen
quite
a
venerable
age
he
laughed
yet
still
very
young
for
an
instructor
of
youth
you
see
i
only
expect
to
teach
little
children
she
said
apologetically
he
looked
at
her
gravely
and
curiously
do
you
think
you
will
enjoy
such
a
life
he
inquired
no
she
admitted
frankly
i
do
not
imagine
that
it
will
be
a
pleasant
life
certainly
but
it
will
be
better
than
the
farm
i
shall
earn
my
support
and
not
have
my
dependence
continually
thrust
in
my
face
by
a
vulgar
woman
poor
child
he
thought
to
himself
as
the
sensitive
color
rushed
over
her
brow
and
throat
he
left
her
with
a
thrill
of
deep
compassion
in
his
heart
she
seemed
so
slight
and
frail
a
creature
to
take
arms
against
the
world
and
win
her
way
alone
may
i
come
again
with
walter
he
added
fancying
that
he
saw
her
hesitate
yes
she
replied
readily
and
bring
violet
with
you
if
she
will
come
very
well
he
replied
i
will
do
so
but
i
shall
come
alone
the
next
day
to
hear
you
sing
are
you
willing
they
will
think
i
am
selfish
if
i
take
you
away
from
them
i
fear
you
will
not
be
taking
me
away
i
belong
to
no
one
but
myself
he
replied
then
too
i
shall
return
home
in
a
few
days
and
i
do
not
know
when
i
shall
see
you
again
you
may
come
she
replied
quickly
the
next
day
he
came
with
violet
and
walter
as
agreed
upon
but
the
visit
was
short
and
unsatisfactory
violet
was
fidgety
and
capricious
she
said
she
had
planned
a
visit
to
another
young
lady
and
she
left
very
soon
carrying
valchester
in
her
train
and
telling
walter
to
remain
behind
and
amuse
jaquelina
walter
remained
very
willingly
he
had
been
thinking
a
great
deal
of
what
violet
had
said
to
him
about
marrying
jaquelina
in
consequence
he
had
concluded
to
take
her
advice
but
it
is
one
thing
to
resolve
and
another
to
execute
jaquelina
who
was
exceedingly
friendly
and
sociable
with
walter
in
the
company
of
others
was
very
shy
when
alone
with
him
she
somehow
eluded
the
efforts
he
made
to
give
a
sentimental
tone
to
the
conversation
she
sang
at
his
request
but
it
was
a
gay
and
lively
air
if
she
had
known
his
intention
she
could
not
have
frustrated
it
better
than
she
did
by
her
unconscious
indifference
walter
went
away
with
his
love
unspoken
two
days
later
he
returned
alone
having
slipped
away
from
his
friend
and
sister
just
as
valchester
had
done
once
or
twice
before
jaquelina
was
out
under
the
trees
reading
little
dollie
was
frisking
in
the
grass
beside
her
walter
thought
he
had
never
seen
the
girl
he
loved
looking
so
fair
and
happy
he
pleased
himself
with
thinking
how
he
would
take
her
away
from
her
uncongenial
home
and
lavish
upon
her
all
the
luxuries
and
adornments
that
would
suit
her
beauty
so
well
the
thought
gave
him
courage
to
speak
to
jaquelina
it
was
not
long
before
she
was
blushing
and
trembling
at
these
words
from
his
lips
lina
i
love
you
dearly
will
you
be
my
wife
oh
earle
she
cried
out
looking
lovely
as
a
dream
in
her
dismay
and
confusion
i
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
i
did
not
dream
of
your
loving
me
since
yesterday
i
have
been
engaged
to
mr
valchester
chapter
xiii
walter
earle
handsome
face
grew
pale
with
surprise
and
emotion
at
the
words
of
the
beautiful
girl
he
loved
so
dearly
when
at
last
he
could
speak
he
cried
out
hoarsely
engaged
to
valchester
is
it
possible
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
why
not
earle
if
you
loved
me
why
should
not
he
have
loved
me
also
asked
jaquelina
with
gentle
dignity
though
her
cheeks
flushed
deeply
walter
earle
stared
at
her
a
moment
in
silence
he
began
to
realize
the
effect
of
her
bright
and
charming
beauty
as
he
had
never
done
before
all
along
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
other
men
were
blind
he
had
thought
to
put
forth
his
hand
and
pluck
a
rose
that
none
other
had
sighed
for
but
another
had
been
there
before
him
i
thought
valchester
was
too
selfishly
absorbed
in
his
books
and
poetry
to
think
of
love
he
responded
then
he
added
with
a
bitterness
he
could
not
repress
you
will
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
miss
meredith
on
having
secured
such
a
desirable
thank
you
i
consider
myself
a
very
fortunate
girl
jaquelina
answered
with
a
movement
of
graceful
pride
no
doubt
said
walter
so
excited
and
pained
by
her
refusal
of
his
suit
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
do
her
justice
even
in
his
thoughts
others
will
consider
you
a
very
fortunate
person
also
it
is
well
known
that
valchester
parents
are
exceedingly
wealthy
jaquelina
pretty
proud
face
grew
pale
at
his
words
i
did
not
know
that
she
said
did
you
not
really
asked
walter
no
i
did
not
she
replied
then
with
a
crimson
blush
did
you
think
earle
that
i
accepted
valchester
for
mercenary
considerations
the
pain
and
shame
in
the
winning
face
overcame
walter
unreasonable
and
unjust
mood
forgive
me
he
said
i
was
tempted
a
moment
to
think
so
but
of
course
i
know
better
after
what
you
have
just
told
me
the
smart
of
my
own
pain
made
me
unjust
do
not
be
angry
with
me
lina
if
i
may
call
you
so
this
once
i
shall
hope
still
to
be
your
friend
since
i
can
not
claim
a
dearer
title
jaquelina
held
out
her
hand
to
him
impulsively
walter
kissed
it
tenderly
and
regretfully
valchester
is
a
noble
fellow
he
said
bravely
i
hope
you
may
be
very
happy
together
when
he
was
gone
jaquelina
wept
a
shower
of
bright
tears
upon
the
pages
of
her
book
she
was
very
sorry
for
poor
walter
disappointment
she
cried
so
bitterly
that
little
dollie
was
affected
to
participation
in
her
grief
and
wept
in
unison
whereat
jaquelina
dried
her
tears
and
laughed
there
now
dollie
we
are
done
crying
she
said
we
are
very
sorry
for
walter
he
is
gay
and
good
and
handsome
but
ronald
is
my
prince
her
spirits
were
very
light
and
gay
now
it
was
only
the
day
before
that
ronald
valchester
had
wooed
her
to
be
his
wife
he
had
told
her
how
beautiful
and
gifted
she
was
and
how
fondly
he
loved
her
and
then
jaquelina
had
suddenly
wakened
to
the
truth
that
she
had
long
ago
given
her
heart
into
his
keeping
lina
can
you
give
your
heart
to
me
he
had
pleaded
and
she
had
answered
frankly
yet
shyly
with
her
sweet
face
turned
away
i
believe
it
has
been
yours
a
long
long
time
valchester
only
i
did
not
quite
know
it
until
now
valchester
was
very
demonstrative
for
awhile
considering
that
he
was
usually
so
quiet
and
grave
before
he
left
he
had
made
his
betrothed
promise
that
with
her
uncle
consent
the
wedding
should
be
in
three
months
because
darling
i
am
anxious
to
take
you
away
from
your
uncongenial
home
and
transplant
my
rosebud
to
a
sunnier
sphere
of
life
he
said
kissing
the
dewy
crimson
lips
ardently
yet
tenderly
the
dark
eyes
looked
at
him
shyly
from
under
the
white
lids
and
the
jetty
fringe
of
her
long
curling
lashes
so
i
shall
not
have
to
seek
a
situation
after
all
she
said
happily
no
indeed
he
answered
with
a
shudder
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
you
my
tender
flower
out
in
the
cold
world
alone
the
bleak
frosts
of
adversity
and
sorrow
would
destroy
you
he
was
mistaken
the
time
was
coming
when
he
was
to
learn
what
a
brave
heart
and
strong
patience
lay
hidden
beneath
the
fragile
seeming
of
the
lovely
girl
who
held
his
heart
the
summer
breeze
sighing
softly
over
the
grass
and
flowers
and
lifting
the
dark
careless
locks
from
his
broad
white
brow
had
no
subtle
voice
to
warn
him
of
the
long
dark
shadow
that
was
ever
widening
between
him
and
the
prize
that
seemed
almost
within
his
grasp
walter
earle
did
not
go
home
immediately
after
his
rejection
by
jaquelina
he
had
loved
her
with
as
much
ardor
as
he
was
capable
of
and
he
felt
the
pain
of
his
disappointment
deeply
he
wandered
homeward
slowly
through
the
green
woods
and
threw
himself
down
by
a
purling
brook
to
rest
it
was
twilight
when
he
reached
home
he
looked
in
the
parlor
for
violet
but
she
was
not
there
his
father
and
ronald
valchester
were
discussing
some
political
news
his
mother
was
placidly
crocheting
lace
on
the
sofa
he
went
on
quietly
to
violet
own
especial
room
and
tapped
lightly
on
the
door
come
in
she
said
and
he
turned
the
and
entered
violet
was
at
the
mirror
looping
back
her
fair
curls
with
roses
and
white
jessamine
she
looked
very
fair
and
sweet
in
her
white
evening
dress
and
pearl
and
turquoise
jewelry
a
fact
of
which
she
was
not
unaware
herself
for
a
smile
of
gratified
vanity
curved
her
rosy
lips
as
she
surveyed
her
own
reflection
in
the
full
length
mirror
ah
miss
vanity
cried
walter
trying
hard
to
be
his
natural
careless
self
how
do
you
like
yourself
violet
turned
around
and
swept
him
a
gay
little
courtesy
very
well
indeed
sir
she
laughed
how
do
you
like
me
walter
walter
looked
at
the
tall
stylish
figure
and
the
fair
smiling
face
with
its
large
blue
eyes
and
rosy
lips
with
genuine
admiration
i
do
not
believe
any
other
fellow
has
as
pretty
a
sister
as
i
have
he
replied
and
violet
gave
him
a
charming
kiss
in
return
for
his
praise
where
have
you
been
walter
she
said
we
have
missed
you
all
the
evening
valchester
was
quite
puzzled
but
i
could
very
nearly
guess
only
i
did
not
let
him
know
it
walter
had
thrown
himself
down
in
a
chair
at
the
window
the
rich
lace
curtains
were
drawn
aside
admitting
the
evening
breeze
sweet
with
the
breath
of
flowers
he
stared
moodily
out
at
the
full
moon
rising
over
the
dark
line
of
the
distant
hills
where
have
you
been
walter
said
violet
again
seeing
that
he
made
her
no
answer
were
you
with
jaquelina
yes
he
replied
with
cold
brevity
violet
went
over
and
sat
down
by
his
side
she
raised
her
fair
smiling
face
to
his
in
wonder
she
saw
the
brooding
shadow
of
pain
on
the
blonde
handsome
face
walter
what
is
it
has
has
anything
happened
she
said
vaguely
nothing
has
happened
he
replied
in
a
moody
tone
was
jaquelina
well
she
asked
puzzled
never
better
he
replied
with
transient
bitterness
violet
did
not
know
what
to
think
walter
was
not
lina
kind
to
you
she
asked
gently
no
he
replied
briefly
and
bitterly
the
soft
flush
had
faded
from
violet
cheeks
a
look
of
dread
came
into
her
eyes
but
walter
did
not
see
it
he
had
never
turned
his
sad
gaze
from
the
distant
hills
gilded
with
glory
by
the
rising
moon
walter
do
you
mean
she
said
with
lips
that
quivered
strangely
that
you
have
asked
lina
to
marry
you
yes
he
answered
very
low
and
she
oh
she
did
not
refuse
you
cried
violet
indignantly
yes
again
said
walter
still
without
looking
at
her
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
then
violet
cried
out
the
impertinent
little
jade
why
what
did
she
mean
i
should
have
thought
that
she
would
have
jumped
at
the
chance
of
marrying
a
rich
handsome
young
man
like
you
walter
then
walter
looked
round
at
her
violet
do
not
use
such
hasty
words
he
said
sadly
she
has
a
right
to
make
her
own
choice
she
has
set
her
mark
higher
even
than
your
unworthy
brother
you
do
not
mean
said
violet
slowly
then
paused
while
every
vestige
of
color
fled
from
her
lips
and
cheeks
as
she
stared
at
walter
she
is
engaged
to
valchester
he
answered
abruptly
the
words
came
with
the
suddenness
of
a
blow
violet
shivered
and
moaned
like
something
wounded
to
death
then
all
in
a
moment
she
slid
from
her
seat
to
the
floor
and
lay
there
a
white
and
senseless
heap
upon
the
rich
velvet
carpet
walter
sprang
from
his
seat
in
alarm
and
consternation
he
had
never
before
suspected
the
secret
of
violet
hidden
love
for
ronald
valchester
it
all
rushed
over
him
now
overwhelmingly
with
almost
womanly
tenderness
he
lifted
his
stricken
sister
gently
to
a
sofa
and
bringing
de
from
the
laved
her
cold
face
and
hands
with
the
refreshing
water
she
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
blankly
at
him
in
a
moment
darling
are
you
any
better
he
asked
gently
then
violet
threw
her
white
arms
round
his
neck
and
clung
to
him
weeping
wildly
walter
is
it
indeed
true
she
sobbed
is
she
to
marry
ronald
so
she
says
he
answered
do
you
care
violet
i
hate
her
violet
cried
drawing
herself
from
his
arms
and
sitting
upright
while
rage
and
jealousy
flashed
from
her
eyes
i
hate
her
she
has
stolen
my
lover
from
me
walter
blue
eyes
flashed
lightning
violet
is
that
true
he
asked
i
thought
my
friend
was
the
soul
of
honor
but
if
he
has
dared
to
trifle
with
your
affections
he
shall
render
me
an
account
for
his
perfidy
violet
only
wept
and
sobbed
without
replying
tell
me
dear
persisted
walter
has
valchester
made
love
to
you
really
while
he
was
slyly
wooing
miss
meredith
violet
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
had
not
but
if
he
had
never
seen
her
if
she
had
let
him
alone
i
must
have
won
him
by
the
strength
of
my
own
love
he
could
not
help
loving
me
in
time
therefore
lina
has
really
stolen
him
from
me
she
persisted
most
unreasonably
walter
could
not
see
that
it
was
as
violet
said
he
tried
to
argue
the
case
with
her
but
he
soon
found
that
violet
was
too
jealous
and
miserable
to
listen
to
reason
she
only
reiterated
again
and
again
her
hatred
of
jaquelina
meredith
walter
took
a
great
deal
of
blame
to
himself
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
done
wrong
ever
to
have
brought
ronald
valchester
to
laurel
hill
you
see
vi
he
said
miserably
i
never
looked
upon
valchester
as
one
to
be
lightly
won
or
one
to
lightly
win
a
woman
heart
he
is
not
usually
gallant
or
even
attentive
to
ladies
i
thought
him
only
a
wrapped
up
in
metaphysics
and
poetry
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
i
have
told
you
that
too
often
vi
for
me
to
deny
it
now
when
he
has
become
my
successful
rival
and
the
source
of
sorrow
to
yourself
but
i
thought
he
was
simply
one
of
the
men
whom
his
own
sex
always
admire
but
women
seldom
or
never
i
do
not
believe
that
jaquelina
admires
him
cried
violet
she
is
attracted
by
his
wealth
and
position
nothing
that
walter
could
say
could
change
her
opinion
she
adhered
to
it
tenaciously
walter
was
deeply
sorry
for
her
her
jealous
anger
and
her
wild
grief
distressed
him
exceedingly
violet
think
no
more
of
it
he
would
say
valchester
is
going
away
i
will
never
invite
him
to
laurel
hill
again
and
when
he
is
out
of
sight
you
will
forget
him
i
shall
never
forget
him
his
sister
replied
i
shall
never
forget
him
and
i
shall
never
love
anyone
but
ronald
valchester
my
oh
walter
can
not
you
think
of
something
to
separate
them
and
turn
his
heart
to
me
she
added
with
piteous
pleading
walter
was
shocked
darling
you
are
talking
wildly
he
cried
you
would
not
wish
such
a
thing
let
me
call
mother
she
can
soothe
you
better
than
i
can
she
sprang
up
in
the
wildest
alarm
walter
promise
me
here
and
now
she
cried
that
you
will
never
reveal
my
wretched
secret
to
mamma
nor
to
any
living
one
i
will
never
unlock
my
arms
from
your
neck
until
you
swear
to
me
that
you
will
never
never
betray
me
her
arms
were
wreathed
tightly
round
his
neck
her
anguished
white
face
and
wild
blue
eyes
looked
into
his
own
imploringly
walter
could
not
refuse
to
give
her
the
promise
she
pleaded
for
but
he
regretted
it
many
and
many
a
day
afterward
he
promised
her
and
she
kissed
him
and
thanked
him
now
violet
we
must
really
go
down
to
the
parlor
he
said
anxious
to
distract
her
attention
our
absence
will
be
noticed
and
wondered
at
smooth
your
hair
and
dress
and
come
with
me
this
is
the
last
night
of
valchester
stay
and
we
must
not
seem
discourteous
you
may
go
she
said
but
i
can
not
tell
them
i
have
a
headache
and
do
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
do
not
suffer
mamma
to
come
i
feel
very
angry
with
her
it
was
she
who
insisted
on
patronizing
that
wretched
girl
but
for
that
ronald
never
would
have
seen
her
her
brother
went
down
reluctantly
violet
lay
motionless
on
her
couch
for
long
hours
when
she
roused
herself
at
last
and
went
to
close
the
window
the
lamp
had
burned
low
and
the
mysterious
stillness
of
midnight
brooded
over
everything
violet
lifted
her
hand
and
turned
a
white
desperate
face
up
to
the
starry
sky
before
god
she
cried
in
low
passionate
accents
i
swear
that
i
will
be
revenged
on
jaquelina
meredith
for
winning
ronald
valchester
away
from
me
she
shall
never
be
his
wife
and
if
mortal
power
can
accomplish
it
i
will
make
of
her
life
one
long
agony
such
as
she
has
made
of
mine
so
under
the
starry
arch
of
heaven
violet
vow
of
vengeance
was
registered
beside
that
of
gerald
huntington
poor
jaquelina
sleeping
softly
on
her
little
white
couch
and
dreaming
of
her
handsome
gifted
lover
did
no
swift
subtle
warning
tell
her
of
the
false
friend
and
the
outraged
prisoner
whose
hands
were
outstretched
to
dash
the
cup
of
happiness
from
her
beautiful
lips
chapter
xiv
one
golden
evening
in
september
meredith
came
in
from
his
weekly
trip
to
town
considerably
excited
there
news
lina
he
said
to
his
niece
who
was
laying
the
cloth
on
the
table
and
deftly
arranging
the
jaquelina
looked
at
him
with
a
start
and
a
blush
she
fancied
he
had
brought
her
a
letter
from
her
lover
well
uncle
charlie
she
said
expectantly
yes
said
farmer
meredith
there
wonderful
news
for
you
the
gerald
huntington
attempted
to
escape
night
before
last
he
knocked
down
two
keepers
and
got
almost
a
mile
away
before
he
was
caught
and
taken
back
they
say
he
fought
like
a
lion
for
his
freedom
jaquelina
started
and
grew
deadly
pale
at
his
words
i
have
brought
the
newspaper
with
me
went
on
the
farmer
it
all
written
there
stop
clattering
the
dishes
a
minute
lina
and
i
read
it
out
for
you
his
niece
stood
still
with
her
hand
resting
on
the
table
and
listened
while
he
turned
the
paper
and
read
out
slowly
attempted
escape
of
gerald
huntington
the
chief
of
the
outlaw
gang
that
had
infested
the
mountains
so
long
and
who
was
so
summarily
captured
little
more
than
a
year
ago
by
a
brave
young
girl
having
read
this
much
which
was
printed
in
flaring
head
lines
and
capitals
meredith
cleared
his
throat
and
proceeded
to
attack
the
smaller
type
it
is
well
known
to
the
most
of
our
readers
that
the
case
against
gerald
huntington
was
decided
in
the
court
on
monday
by
a
sentence
of
ten
years
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
the
prisoner
was
remanded
to
the
county
jail
to
remain
until
friday
when
he
was
to
be
removed
to
the
penitentiary
tuesday
evening
at
dusk
he
was
visited
in
his
cell
by
a
veiled
lady
who
remained
with
him
half
an
hour
engaged
in
deep
and
private
conversation
it
is
supposed
that
this
mysterious
stranger
conveyed
to
him
a
club
which
was
skillfully
concealed
beneath
her
voluminous
draperies
at
nightfall
the
prisoner
armed
with
this
enormous
and
heavy
implement
assaulted
the
keeper
who
brought
him
his
supper
and
succeeded
in
escaping
into
the
hall
where
he
knocked
down
the
and
made
a
desperate
run
for
liberty
he
was
pursued
by
several
persons
who
captured
and
bound
him
after
a
terrible
struggle
he
is
now
heavily
ironed
and
chained
down
to
the
floor
of
his
cell
public
curiosity
is
highly
excited
over
the
mysterious
veiled
visitant
who
furnished
him
the
club
but
the
prisoner
preserves
a
dogged
and
obstinate
silence
regarding
her
and
nothing
is
known
of
her
in
the
town
oh
poor
fellow
cried
jaquelina
quite
involuntarily
as
he
paused
chained
to
the
floor
of
his
cell
how
dreadful
you
are
not
sorry
for
the
wretch
are
you
lina
said
her
uncle
looking
at
her
in
surprise
yes
very
sorry
she
said
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
the
gloomy
prison
cell
and
the
clanking
chains
that
held
gerald
huntington
down
from
the
free
wild
woodland
life
he
loved
well
you
had
ought
to
be
sorry
said
meredith
who
had
come
in
from
the
with
the
fresh
butter
and
milk
for
tea
with
dollie
trotting
behind
her
a
great
red
apple
in
either
chubby
fist
his
capture
made
you
two
hundred
dollars
the
richer
if
you
had
spent
every
dollar
of
it
so
foolishly
she
added
as
an
and
in
an
injured
tone
for
she
had
been
deeply
offended
at
the
way
in
which
jaquelina
had
spent
her
money
she
had
ought
to
have
given
it
to
her
uncle
to
pay
for
her
keep
was
her
frankly
expressed
opinion
jaquelina
made
no
answer
to
meredith
taunt
she
was
looking
at
her
uncle
wistfully
uncle
charles
did
you
stop
at
the
she
asked
shyly
why
certainly
how
did
i
come
by
the
newspaper
else
inquired
the
farmer
with
a
sly
twinkle
of
his
gray
eyes
were
were
there
any
letters
for
me
said
the
girl
coloring
under
his
laughing
glance
two
said
meredith
and
only
the
day
before
yesterday
there
were
two
it
seems
as
if
valchester
has
nothing
to
do
but
write
he
fished
the
mail
out
of
his
coat
pocket
as
he
spoke
and
gave
her
the
two
letters
she
caught
them
eagerly
from
his
hand
and
hurried
from
the
room
two
of
the
ninnies
ever
i
saw
sniffed
meredith
disdainfully
everlastingly
writing
back
and
forth
to
each
other
i
should
think
they
run
out
of
news
tut
tut
wife
said
the
farmer
gaily
do
be
hard
on
the
young
folks
do
you
remember
when
you
and
i
were
sparking
at
singing
school
that
winter
how
many
little
notes
we
kept
passing
to
each
other
and
no
news
in
any
of
them
either
nothing
but
love
love
love
meredith
turned
her
back
at
this
juncture
but
the
homely
reminiscence
must
have
had
its
effect
on
her
her
sharp
tongue
was
silenced
for
awhile
she
busied
herself
in
setting
the
appetizing
supper
on
the
small
table
then
went
out
to
the
door
and
called
jaquelina
in
to
the
meal
jaquelina
sitting
under
a
maple
tree
that
was
beginning
to
turn
crimson
under
the
kisses
of
september
returned
an
answer
to
the
effect
that
she
was
not
hungry
and
did
not
desire
any
supper
always
the
way
said
meredith
returning
to
the
table
and
supplying
dollie
with
her
portion
of
mush
and
milk
after
she
gets
one
of
them
letters
from
that
beau
of
hers
she
is
that
excited
she
ca
swallow
a
bite
to
eat
say
what
you
will
charlie
meredith
you
ca
prove
that
ever
i
lost
my
appetite
while
you
courted
me
meredith
only
laughed
as
he
drew
up
his
chair
to
the
table
and
lina
was
left
unmolested
to
read
and
the
closely
written
letter
in
which
her
lover
poured
out
his
affection
clothed
in
the
beautiful
imagery
of
a
poetic
heart
my
darling
wrote
ronald
valchester
as
our
bridal
day
is
now
only
two
weeks
off
i
have
one
request
to
make
of
you
as
our
wedding
is
to
be
such
a
simple
and
quiet
one
in
the
little
country
church
will
you
not
wear
just
to
please
me
the
pretty
white
robe
you
wore
on
the
night
i
saw
you
first
never
mind
what
others
say
it
is
a
beautiful
dress
and
you
will
be
beautiful
in
it
i
have
a
fancy
for
you
to
wear
it
in
the
moment
when
you
give
yourself
to
me
the
happiest
moment
of
my
life
afterwards
you
shall
have
silks
and
satins
laces
and
jewels
if
you
care
for
these
things
i
shall
be
with
you
the
day
before
the
wedding
my
mother
will
accompany
me
i
will
tell
you
in
confidence
darling
she
is
a
very
proud
and
stately
old
lady
but
you
must
not
be
afraid
of
her
i
know
she
can
not
help
but
love
you
as
i
know
you
can
not
help
but
love
her
i
have
had
a
kind
letter
recently
from
walter
earle
and
a
charming
note
from
violet
in
which
she
tells
me
you
have
asked
her
to
be
your
bridesmaid
and
she
has
consented
violet
is
a
very
sweet
and
lovely
girl
i
am
glad
you
are
such
friends
with
her
this
and
a
great
deal
more
ronald
valchester
wrote
to
his
betrothed
she
pored
over
it
fondly
and
blushingly
kissed
the
page
where
the
dear
white
hand
had
rested
while
it
traced
the
loving
words
meredith
had
spoken
truly
when
she
said
that
jaquelina
could
never
eat
when
she
received
one
of
those
letters
from
ronald
they
filled
her
heart
and
soul
so
fully
that
mere
material
food
seemed
unnecessary
the
young
heart
which
had
gone
hungering
for
love
so
long
and
suffered
isolation
through
all
its
dreary
years
of
orphanage
was
steeped
to
its
depths
in
the
golden
glamour
of
first
love
bewildering
dream
she
rose
at
last
and
wandered
down
to
the
little
brook
and
sat
down
to
watch
its
dimpling
flow
with
dreamy
dark
eyes
meredith
forbore
to
call
her
to
help
with
the
milking
or
tend
dollie
as
she
had
been
wont
to
do
since
jaquelina
had
returned
home
with
the
added
polish
of
her
upon
her
and
more
especially
since
she
had
become
the
affianced
of
the
proud
ronald
valchester
the
coarse
woman
had
stood
somewhat
in
awe
of
her
husband
graceful
and
refined
niece
a
newly
awakened
and
resentful
sense
of
vague
inferiority
made
her
feel
ill
at
ease
in
her
company
the
sun
was
setting
goldenly
and
warmly
as
it
does
under
skies
in
the
golden
month
of
september
the
soft
sounds
of
early
autumn
filled
the
balmy
air
slowly
the
gold
and
purple
and
crimson
of
sunset
faded
from
the
sky
and
gave
place
to
dusky
twilight
jaquelina
scarcely
noticed
it
she
did
not
feel
the
soft
dew
falling
on
her
face
and
hands
she
was
lost
in
a
sweet
and
dreamy
revery
yet
suddenly
with
an
inexplicable
start
and
shiver
she
lifted
her
eyes
in
the
silence
that
seemed
only
more
audible
by
the
low
melodious
murmur
of
the
streamlet
she
had
caught
a
strange
sound
not
a
voice
not
a
footstep
only
the
cold
heavy
clank
of
an
iron
chain
when
she
looked
up
she
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
brook
and
looking
across
at
her
with
steadfast
gleaming
eyes
he
was
a
tall
man
dressed
in
ragged
clothing
like
a
common
tramp
his
face
was
blackened
to
the
hue
of
a
negro
by
soot
or
charcoal
but
the
finely
molded
features
were
those
of
a
white
man
in
the
waning
light
jaquelina
could
see
that
his
wrists
were
manacled
and
heavy
irons
were
fastened
about
his
ankles
from
which
depended
chains
that
had
been
severed
in
two
chapter
xv
at
that
sudden
and
apparition
jaquelina
remained
for
a
moment
perfectly
motionless
surprise
and
terror
had
rendered
her
for
the
time
perfectly
incapable
of
speech
or
motion
meanwhile
the
gleaming
black
eyes
of
the
man
looking
inordinately
large
and
fierce
in
his
blackened
face
were
riveted
upon
her
beautiful
pallid
features
miss
meredith
do
you
not
know
me
he
asked
breaking
the
silence
at
last
in
a
low
deep
angry
voice
jaquelina
shivered
and
started
at
that
intense
voice
his
name
fell
from
her
lips
in
a
gasp
gerald
huntington
yes
he
said
bitterly
gerald
huntington
i
see
you
have
not
forgotten
me
my
tattered
garb
my
blackened
face
are
not
sufficient
to
hide
your
victim
from
your
keen
eyes
he
held
up
his
hands
that
were
blackened
also
and
she
shivered
as
she
saw
the
heavy
handcuffs
that
were
still
clasped
about
his
wrists
though
the
strong
chain
that
had
bound
them
together
was
filed
in
half
i
have
escaped
from
the
prison
to
which
you
betrayed
me
he
said
to
her
in
a
tone
of
fierce
triumph
and
joy
in
all
the
terror
of
that
moment
jaquelina
felt
as
though
a
heavy
weight
had
been
lifted
off
her
heart
before
god
i
am
glad
she
broke
out
fervently
clasping
her
small
hands
together
while
her
dark
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
but
a
scowl
of
withering
scorn
and
unbelief
broke
over
the
dark
features
of
the
outlaw
transforming
them
to
the
semblance
of
a
demon
jaquelina
was
reminded
irresistibly
of
the
vivid
words
in
which
byron
had
described
the
corsair
there
was
a
laughing
devil
in
his
sneer
that
raised
emotions
of
both
love
and
fear
and
where
his
scowl
of
hatred
darkly
fell
hope
withering
fled
and
mercy
sighed
farewell
do
not
lie
to
me
miss
meredith
exclaimed
gerald
huntington
with
that
terrible
sneer
still
curling
his
lips
do
not
lie
to
me
in
hope
of
turning
aside
the
shaft
of
my
deadly
revenge
i
have
sworn
to
punish
you
and
i
shall
keep
my
vow
you
pretend
to
a
penitence
you
do
not
feel
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
you
would
be
glad
to
deliver
me
up
to
justice
this
minute
no
i
would
not
replied
jaquelina
earnestly
she
was
getting
over
the
first
shock
of
her
surprise
and
terror
and
her
young
face
looked
brave
and
almost
fearless
as
she
lifted
it
in
the
dim
light
i
would
not
for
worlds
betray
you
to
your
foes
again
see
how
quietly
i
sit
here
without
raising
my
voice
or
trying
to
alarm
anyone
that
is
because
you
are
afraid
of
me
he
said
mockingly
as
he
put
his
hand
in
his
bosom
that
she
might
hear
the
click
of
his
threatening
weapon
i
am
a
desperate
man
and
you
know
it
miss
meredith
if
you
tried
to
raise
an
alarm
i
should
immediately
shoot
you
they
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
silently
across
the
narrow
strip
of
singing
water
a
braver
heart
than
little
jaquelina
might
have
quailed
at
his
aspect
the
murderous
gleam
in
his
eyes
might
have
daunted
a
heart
less
true
and
pure
than
hers
but
he
did
not
see
her
tremble
as
she
answered
earnestly
i
do
not
intend
to
raise
an
alarm
huntington
on
the
contrary
i
am
willing
and
even
anxious
to
do
you
a
kindness
if
it
lies
in
my
power
is
there
aught
i
can
do
for
you
are
you
thirsty
or
hungry
if
so
let
me
bring
you
food
and
drink
he
stared
at
her
with
a
muttered
curse
so
you
are
laying
a
trap
to
ensnare
me
he
said
roughly
no
thank
you
fair
lady
i
am
not
ready
to
fall
into
your
power
so
easily
perhaps
now
you
would
lend
me
a
horse
to
carry
me
a
few
miles
out
of
danger
reach
since
you
are
so
kindly
disposed
toward
me
sneeringly
the
young
moon
rising
over
the
hills
threw
a
beam
upon
face
showing
it
white
and
troubled
and
earnest
i
have
no
horse
of
my
own
she
said
hesitatingly
if
i
should
lend
you
one
of
my
uncle
might
i
dare
hope
that
you
would
turn
it
loose
after
a
few
miles
and
let
it
come
back
no
you
might
not
dare
to
hope
he
said
mockingly
i
ask
no
favors
at
your
hands
it
would
spoil
the
sweet
flavor
of
my
revenge
i
am
not
friendless
as
you
suppose
i
have
a
purse
of
gold
in
my
breast
and
a
swift
horse
waiting
for
me
not
a
mile
away
from
here
i
but
turned
aside
from
my
way
for
one
look
at
the
fair
that
beguiled
me
to
my
ruin
and
now
that
i
have
seen
you
lovely
jaquelina
i
am
loath
to
part
from
you
again
i
am
tempted
to
take
you
away
with
me
and
make
you
an
outlaw
cherished
and
fondly
worshiped
bride
with
a
low
cry
of
sudden
fear
and
alarm
jaquelina
sprang
up
and
turned
to
flee
but
her
enemy
was
too
swift
for
her
at
a
single
bound
he
cleared
the
brook
and
before
she
had
run
a
dozen
rods
he
caught
her
arm
in
a
grasp
of
steel
she
turned
toward
him
with
a
white
imploring
face
and
frightened
eyes
let
me
go
she
panted
with
failing
breath
i
can
not
go
with
you
i
can
not
be
your
wife
he
laughed
scornfully
you
shall
go
free
he
said
do
not
be
frightened
the
time
for
my
revenge
is
not
yet
i
shall
only
dash
the
cup
of
joy
from
your
lips
when
it
is
so
full
that
a
will
cause
it
to
overflow
i
am
going
now
but
remember
this
truth
my
fair
enemy
i
am
not
powerless
i
am
only
biding
my
time
in
the
moment
that
is
the
happiest
of
your
whole
life
i
shall
take
my
revenge
he
threw
her
wrathfully
from
him
and
in
a
moment
had
disappeared
from
sight
and
hearing
jaquelina
lay
a
moment
in
the
long
dewy
grass
where
she
had
fallen
her
heart
thrilling
with
a
dumb
prescient
fear
and
dread
in
the
moment
that
is
the
happiest
of
your
whole
life
i
will
take
my
revenge
gerald
huntington
had
said
and
those
words
had
strangely
recalled
the
words
of
her
lover
letter
in
the
moment
when
you
give
yourself
to
me
the
happiest
moment
of
my
life
ronald
valchester
had
written
and
jaquelina
shivered
with
a
nameless
dread
and
terror
for
she
knew
that
that
moment
would
be
the
happiest
one
of
her
whole
life
also
chapter
xvi
oh
ronald
ronald
lina
my
little
darling
and
ronald
valchester
drew
his
betrothed
into
his
arms
and
pressed
a
score
of
fond
kisses
on
the
dewy
crimson
lips
it
was
the
day
before
the
wedding
and
though
jaquelina
had
been
expecting
him
all
the
morning
he
had
taken
her
by
surprise
at
last
after
dinner
she
had
gone
out
into
the
orchard
and
sat
down
beneath
her
favorite
tree
feeling
certain
that
ronald
would
seek
her
there
first
but
after
watching
for
him
vainly
for
awhile
she
fell
into
a
dreamy
revery
in
which
he
came
unseen
and
unheard
at
last
he
sat
down
beside
her
letting
his
arm
remain
about
the
slender
waist
and
with
the
beauty
and
silence
of
nature
all
about
them
they
talked
of
their
happiness
in
meeting
again
and
of
the
coming
morrow
when
they
should
be
united
to
part
no
more
it
seems
too
blissful
to
be
true
jaquelina
murmured
wistfully
looking
up
in
her
lover
happy
face
oh
ronald
if
anything
should
happen
what
could
happen
lina
said
ronald
valchester
laughing
at
her
fears
i
hope
you
are
not
growing
nervous
and
fanciful
little
one
then
he
suddenly
saw
that
the
bright
that
had
come
into
her
face
when
she
met
him
was
dying
out
and
leaving
her
pale
and
lina
you
do
not
look
quite
so
well
as
usual
he
said
anxiously
you
are
paler
than
i
ever
saw
you
and
your
eyes
have
a
startled
expression
now
and
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
slightly
nervous
are
you
not
well
i
am
perfectly
well
she
replied
quickly
but
his
attention
once
awakened
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
there
was
a
slight
and
subtle
change
in
her
she
would
start
and
look
around
at
the
rustle
of
the
falling
leaves
that
began
to
strew
the
orchard
with
a
carpeting
of
scarlet
and
russet
and
gold
every
time
the
great
mellow
globes
of
winter
apples
would
fall
into
the
grass
she
would
look
up
quickly
with
something
like
fear
in
her
eyes
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
as
ronald
valchester
had
said
that
she
was
nervous
as
his
gaze
dwelt
on
her
full
of
tender
solicitude
she
was
tempted
to
tell
him
of
that
night
two
weeks
ago
when
she
had
been
so
startled
and
frightened
by
the
sudden
appearance
and
menacing
words
of
gerald
huntington
a
haunting
dread
and
terror
had
possessed
her
ever
since
she
waked
at
night
from
startling
dreams
in
which
the
lowering
gaze
and
the
clanking
irons
of
the
escaped
prisoner
were
so
terribly
real
that
she
could
scarcely
persuade
herself
that
it
had
only
been
a
vision
of
her
slumber
her
nights
were
restless
her
days
were
filled
with
dread
she
was
afraid
to
dwell
too
much
on
her
love
and
her
happiness
she
remembered
that
the
outlaw
had
said
he
would
take
his
revenge
in
the
moment
that
was
the
happiest
of
her
life
yet
she
shrank
from
telling
ronald
valchester
the
truth
she
had
noticed
that
he
seemed
to
dislike
the
mention
of
gerald
huntington
he
had
never
praised
her
as
others
did
for
capturing
the
outlaw
he
had
never
even
told
her
whether
he
thought
she
had
acted
right
or
wrong
in
the
matter
she
decided
that
she
would
not
tell
him
she
had
never
told
anyone
of
her
adventure
that
night
though
the
whole
country
was
excited
over
the
second
and
this
time
successful
escape
of
the
prisoner
my
mother
came
with
me
he
said
after
a
little
she
was
fatigued
with
travel
and
did
not
feel
like
calling
on
you
but
i
shall
bring
her
to
see
you
she
claims
the
privilege
of
dressing
the
bride
the
lovely
color
came
surging
up
into
jaquelina
pale
cheeks
at
her
lover
words
oh
you
do
not
know
how
i
dread
the
ordeal
of
night
she
whispered
to
him
all
the
country
people
will
be
crowded
into
the
little
church
and
only
think
i
must
walk
up
the
aisle
before
them
all
to
be
married
ronald
valchester
laughed
at
her
pretty
bashfulness
night
will
be
a
slight
ordeal
to
what
you
will
have
to
encounter
in
the
way
of
people
when
i
take
you
home
to
richmond
he
replied
i
have
never
told
you
yet
my
darling
that
we
are
very
wealthy
i
was
pleased
to
think
that
you
loved
me
for
myself
alone
but
the
truth
is
lina
my
father
is
a
millionaire
and
you
will
enter
the
highest
rank
of
society
when
you
become
my
bride
after
we
have
been
married
awhile
and
you
have
learned
something
of
the
world
i
shall
take
you
with
me
on
a
tour
to
europe
shall
you
like
that
my
dearest
very
much
lina
replied
delightedly
he
did
not
tell
her
that
his
father
the
proud
general
valchester
was
both
grieved
and
disappointed
that
his
handsome
son
whom
half
the
of
richmond
were
sighing
for
had
chosen
to
marry
an
obscure
and
simple
little
country
girl
his
gentle
mother
too
was
distressed
over
it
but
she
had
allowed
her
darling
son
to
persuade
her
that
his
betrothed
was
the
fairest
and
most
lovable
girl
on
earth
and
she
had
come
with
ronald
to
the
wedding
determined
for
the
sake
of
her
son
to
make
the
most
of
her
she
was
staying
with
the
earles
by
express
invitation
and
violet
was
especially
charming
and
affectionate
to
ronald
valchester
mother
so
much
so
indeed
that
stately
old
valchester
unbent
from
her
quiet
dignity
enough
to
say
frankly
it
is
a
wonder
to
me
miss
earle
that
my
ronald
could
have
strayed
any
further
than
laurel
hill
to
make
his
choice
if
miss
meredith
is
any
more
charming
and
lovely
than
you
she
must
be
a
wonderful
girl
a
peculiar
expression
came
over
violet
pale
fair
face
she
turned
her
head
away
and
looked
out
of
the
window
silently
a
moment
but
when
she
looked
back
her
face
wore
a
careless
smile
many
thanks
for
your
compliment
valchester
she
replied
lina
is
very
pretty
i
assure
you
she
has
a
gipsyish
kind
of
beauty
is
she
dark
asked
valchester
and
violet
replied
she
has
a
brown
skin
and
dark
eyes
and
her
hair
is
a
kind
of
chestnut
but
rather
sunburned
i
think
you
see
she
is
always
out
in
the
wind
and
sun
i
am
rather
sorry
she
is
a
brunette
said
valchester
looking
at
violet
beauty
i
always
admired
blondes
the
most
but
hopefully
my
son
tells
me
she
is
a
beautiful
singer
yes
she
has
a
good
voice
admitted
violet
it
is
loud
and
clear
yet
almost
totally
uncultivated
she
has
had
only
a
few
tuition
you
know
but
of
course
after
she
is
married
valchester
will
secure
a
teacher
for
her
in
all
those
branches
in
which
she
is
deficient
of
course
said
ronald
valchester
mother
but
in
her
heart
she
winced
at
the
idea
of
a
who
would
require
teachers
after
she
was
married
what
would
her
fashionable
and
exclusive
set
say
to
such
a
wife
for
her
only
son
of
whom
she
was
so
proud
ronald
told
me
that
miss
meredith
is
quite
fresh
from
she
said
faintly
after
a
moment
oh
yes
she
had
year
at
staunton
said
violet
carelessly
yet
enjoying
to
the
utmost
the
anxiety
she
had
awakened
in
the
mind
of
the
proud
old
lady
of
course
you
know
dear
valchester
that
year
would
not
be
sufficient
to
give
the
polish
requisite
for
such
society
as
your
son
wife
will
mingle
in
you
will
have
to
give
lina
the
benefit
of
your
own
knowledge
of
course
i
am
quite
sure
she
will
do
her
best
to
appear
to
an
advantage
she
has
always
made
the
very
most
of
her
few
opportunities
violet
talked
so
kindly
and
patronizingly
that
valchester
did
not
suspect
the
hidden
malice
that
lurked
in
her
words
yet
she
began
to
feel
vaguely
uncomfortable
her
placid
conviction
that
her
gifted
son
could
not
have
made
a
bad
choice
began
to
give
place
to
anxiety
i
am
very
anxious
to
see
miss
meredith
she
said
i
wish
i
had
felt
well
enough
to
drive
over
to
meredith
farm
with
ronald
tell
me
miss
earle
do
you
think
my
son
has
chosen
a
wife
who
is
likely
to
do
credit
to
his
judgment
i
really
should
not
like
to
express
an
opinion
replied
the
girl
with
an
appearance
of
the
greatest
frankness
it
is
always
very
difficult
to
decide
such
a
question
lina
meredith
is
certainly
unformed
and
a
little
rustic
at
present
but
these
are
defects
which
time
and
the
mingling
in
good
society
will
certainly
amend
you
know
do
you
believe
that
she
is
in
love
with
my
son
asked
the
old
lady
anxiously
and
feeling
to
herself
that
a
genuine
affection
felt
for
ronald
by
the
girl
of
his
choice
would
condone
a
multitude
of
faults
i
could
not
tell
you
replied
violet
i
have
never
heard
her
express
an
opinion
concerning
him
of
course
his
wealth
would
be
a
great
temptation
to
a
girl
in
her
position
but
no
one
has
a
right
to
judge
that
she
accepted
him
for
that
it
must
be
that
she
loved
him
valchester
one
reared
so
rudely
and
plainly
as
poor
lina
has
been
could
not
really
form
an
idea
of
the
great
advantages
wealth
would
bring
her
every
innocent
seeming
word
had
a
barbed
point
for
the
heart
of
the
proud
mother
violet
talked
to
her
some
time
about
jaquelina
she
appeared
very
frank
and
open
but
she
made
valchester
understand
very
plainly
by
skillful
innuendoes
that
she
was
by
no
means
on
terms
of
intimate
association
with
her
son
betrothed
and
that
their
acquaintance
had
simply
consisted
of
a
series
of
kindly
patronizing
acts
on
her
part
chapter

ronald
valchester
whiling
away
the
sunny
afternoon
by
the
side
of
his
betrothed
little
dreamed
with
what
subtle
art
violet
earle
was
implanting
a
prejudice
in
his
mother
mind
against
his
darling
he
was
fastidious
and
harder
to
please
than
most
men
but
even
his
exacting
taste
could
find
few
things
in
jaquelina
that
he
would
have
cared
to
change
she
was
naturally
refined
graceful
and
polished
and
her
beauty
was
so
remarkable
that
even
in
her
simple
print
dress
and
white
ruffled
apron
ronald
thought
her
lovelier
than
any
satin
and
he
had
ever
met
in
society
lina
sing
to
me
he
said
when
the
sunset
glow
began
to
crimson
the
west
i
have
longed
to
hear
you
sing
so
often
while
i
was
away
from
you
she
smiled
and
turned
her
face
to
watch
the
setting
sun
as
she
began
to
sing
ronald
thought
there
was
nothing
on
earth
so
fair
as
that
face
with
the
parted
crimson
lips
and
the
wonderful
light
that
always
came
upon
it
when
she
sang
dawn
awakes
the
eastern
skies
and
wooing
zephyrs
kiss
the
sea
in
vain
i
sigh
for
those
dark
eyes
that
should
have
ope
in
love
to
me
but
they
have
looked
on
me
their
last
time
darkling
wave
they
cheer
no
more
which
now
in
sadness
rushes
past
to
break
upon
an
unknown
shore
lina
hush
he
said
impulsively
when
she
had
sung
that
first
verse
that
is
too
sad
a
song
choose
something
gayer
and
more
suited
to
our
bridal
eve
i
do
not
know
any
gay
songs
ronald
she
replied
with
some
of
the
sadness
of
the
song
yet
lingering
on
her
face
that
is
strange
he
said
did
you
learn
nothing
bright
and
lively
at
school
lina
no
i
do
not
believe
i
did
she
answered
musingly
it
seems
to
me
that
i
always
chose
songs
with
a
touch
of
sadness
in
them
somehow
i
liked
them
best
but
after
a
minute
thought
she
sang
lightly
take
my
heart
be
safe
in
thy
keeping
while
i
go
land
and
sea
smiling
or
sorrowing
waking
or
weeping
what
need
i
care
so
my
heart
is
with
thee
in
the
race
we
are
destined
to
run
love
they
who
have
light
hearts
the
happiest
be
then
happier
still
must
be
they
who
have
none
love
and
that
will
be
my
case
when
mine
is
with
thee
do
you
like
that
one
any
better
ronald
she
said
with
a
smile
when
she
had
finished
it
is
a
pretty
song
he
said
but
do
you
know
lina
you
keep
selecting
songs
that
hint
of
separation
and
sorrow
i
do
not
like
to
hear
you
darling
do
you
begin
to
realize
that
after
we
shall
be
separated
no
more
death
us
do
part
he
took
both
her
small
hands
in
his
as
he
asked
the
question
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
and
he
saw
that
they
were
full
of
bright
unshed
tears
no
ronald
she
said
in
a
faint
fluttering
voice
i
do
not
quite
realize
my
happiness
it
seems
too
bright
to
be
real
she
shivered
slightly
as
she
spoke
and
gave
a
swift
nervous
look
around
her
the
soft
sigh
of
the
evening
breeze
the
rustling
leaves
seemed
to
whisper
threateningly
in
the
moment
that
is
the
happiest
of
your
whole
life
i
shall
take
my
revenge
lina
i
do
not
believe
you
are
well
cried
ronald
valchester
anxiously
i
saw
you
shivering
that
moment
the
twilight
is
coming
on
and
these
september
evenings
are
chilly
she
answered
rising
let
us
go
to
the
house
and
sit
on
the
porch
uncle
charlie
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
when
they
had
crossed
the
purling
brook
and
gone
into
the
little
porch
jaquelina
felt
easier
she
was
nervous
out
in
the
orchard
among
the
whispering
grasses
she
fancied
a
dark
demoniacal
face
peering
at
her
behind
the
trees
when
she
crossed
the
brook
it
seemed
to
be
singing
loudly
in
the
moment
that
is
the
happiest
of
your
whole
life
i
shall
take
my
revenge
the
shadow
of
gerald
huntington
vengeance
was
already
upon
her
but
on
ronald
valchester
love
and
happiness
there
fell
no
cloud
from
the
near
future
to
his
ardent
and
poetic
imagination
life
lay
before
him
fair
and
lovely
like
a
dream
of
summer
meredith
came
out
and
welcomed
his
niece
lover
cordially
and
after
a
brief
conversation
prudently
retired
into
the
house
to
the
companionship
of
his
wife
and
dollie
meredith
persuaded
into
amiability
for
once
in
her
life
by
her
husband
spread
a
dainty
and
supper
upon
the
table
the
lovers
went
through
the
form
of
eating
and
then
returned
to
the
porch
again
where
the
air
was
spicy
and
sweet
with
the
breath
of
roses
and
the
new
moon
rose
over
the
misty
hills
smiling
on
these
two
lovers
who
were
all
the
world
to
each
other
this
time
night
you
will
be
my
bride
ronald
said
to
her
fondly
then
we
will
immediately
take
the
train
for
richmond
oh
lina
how
often
i
have
dreamed
of
that
often
and
often
when
i
think
of
taking
you
with
me
i
recall
the
beautiful
words
in
which
longfellow
describes
the
home
going
of
hiawatha
and
his
bride
do
you
remember
lina
she
repeated
a
few
lines
softly
pleasant
was
the
journey
homeward
all
the
birds
sang
loud
and
sweetly
songs
of
happiness
and
sang
the
the
owaissa
are
you
hiawatha
having
such
a
wife
to
love
you
sang
the
robin
the
opechee
are
you
minnehaha
having
such
a
noble
husband
then
lina
small
hand
stole
softly
into
her
lover
she
raised
her
dark
passionate
eyes
to
his
face
and
he
read
in
their
starry
depths
the
deathless
love
that
filled
her
heart
lina
you
do
love
me
very
much
do
you
not
he
said
lovingly
ah
i
could
not
tell
you
how
much
she
murmured
if
i
were
a
poet
like
you
ronald
i
might
put
my
tenderness
into
glowing
words
but
it
is
locked
deep
within
my
heart
i
think
if
anything
happens
to
part
us
i
should
die
nothing
happen
to
part
us
love
he
answered
night
at
this
hour
you
will
belong
to
me
wholly
and
then
your
life
shall
be
all
de
nothing
can
come
between
us
after
that
magic
ring
is
on
your
finger
we
shall
belong
to
each
other
then
in
the
solemn
beautiful
words
of
the
marriage
service
death
us
do
part
his
happy
mood
and
his
loving
confidence
were
infectious
the
girl
forgot
for
awhile
the
hovering
shadow
of
evil
she
was
gay
and
blithe
and
happy
looking
forward
to
the
morrow
with
timid
tremulous
joy
i
shall
come
for
you
in
a
carriage
evening
myself
he
said
walter
earle
has
promised
to
come
for
mother
in
his
phaeton
violet
will
meet
us
at
the
church
he
kissed
her
saying
that
he
would
bring
his
mother
my
last
he
said
as
he
held
her
small
hands
tightly
a
moment
loth
to
leave
her
and
smiling
at
the
warm
blushes
that
surged
into
her
cheeks
she
watched
him
walking
away
through
the
white
radiance
of
the
moonlight
a
tall
and
graceful
figure
on
which
her
heart
and
her
eyes
dwelt
fondly
she
murmured
his
words
with
trembling
pleasure
our
last
chapter
xviii
my
dear
i
have
brought
you
my
own
bridal
veil
to
wear
i
fancied
i
would
like
ronald
bride
to
wear
it
i
asked
him
about
it
and
he
seemed
very
pleased
with
the
idea
valchester
carefully
unwrapped
the
little
package
of
fine
tissue
paper
and
shook
out
a
web
of
costly
brussels
lace
jaquelina
uttered
a
low
cry
of
delight
it
is
beautiful
she
said
and
you
are
very
kind
mrs
valchester
ronald
handsome
stately
old
mother
looked
pleased
so
you
like
it
she
said
throwing
it
over
jaquelina
head
and
thinking
to
herself
how
beautifully
the
dark
eyes
gleamed
through
its
silvery
mist
now
my
dear
if
we
only
had
a
few
natural
white
flowers
to
arrange
in
your
hair
we
should
do
splendidly
have
you
any
in
your
flower
garden
jaquelina
with
her
graceful
head
on
one
side
studied
intently
i
am
afraid
we
have
none
that
would
do
she
said
scornfully
you
see
valchester
it
is
so
late
in
the
season
that
most
of
the
flowers
are
gone
in
the
spring
and
summer
we
have
white
lilacs
and
syringas
and
roses
and
jessamines
but
now
we
have
only
some
small
white
chrysanthemums
yes
and
a
bed
of
lovely
white
pansies
earle
gave
me
the
plants
last
year
would
they
do
at
all
mrs
valchester
the
very
things
said
the
old
lady
are
there
many
of
them
in
bloom
lots
of
them
said
jaquelina
enthusiastically
and
ah
so
lovely
valchester
they
look
like
white
velvet
and
they
are
so
streaked
and
veined
with
the
loveliest
tints
i
ever
saw
valchester
smiled
indulgently
at
her
girlish
enthusiasm
very
well
lina
she
said
kindly
you
may
bring
me
a
quantity
of
the
darlings
we
will
need
some
for
your
wreath
and
some
for
your
breast
and
a
knot
to
fasten
in
your
belt
lina
who
was
already
dressed
in
the
quaint
pretty
india
muslin
and
the
gold
chain
and
locket
went
down
from
the
little
chamber
in
haste
to
execute
the
commission
meredith
who
was
donning
her
sunday
best
to
attend
the
wedding
looked
out
from
her
chamber
as
the
girl
passed
by
lina
stop
in
my
room
as
you
go
back
she
said
i
something
for
you
very
well
aunt
meredith
i
will
she
said
hurrying
on
full
of
happy
excitement
in
the
softly
falling
twilight
she
glided
down
the
path
to
the
garden
that
lay
silent
and
odorous
under
the
pale
light
of
the
moon
that
hung
like
a
silver
crescent
in
the
dark
blue
sky
just
above
the
line
of
the
distant
hills
lina
knelt
down
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
gathered
a
lapful
of
the
great
velvety
pansies
on
which
the
dewdrops
of
evening
shone
like
glittering
diamonds
her
white
hands
trembled
with
pleasure
her
young
heart
beat
high
with
love
and
rapture
she
had
thrown
off
the
incubus
of
dread
since
ronald
reassuring
words
last
night
yet
a
sudden
swift
memory
caused
her
as
she
rose
to
glance
quickly
around
her
and
then
to
gather
up
her
flowers
and
fly
along
the
path
back
to
the
house
as
she
hurried
up
to
her
own
room
she
suddenly
remembered
meredith
injunction
and
ran
back
to
her
door
where
she
tapped
lightly
it
was
opened
by
her
aunt
who
held
a
small
package
in
her
hand
and
spoke
thickly
with
her
mouth
full
of
hairpins
a
black
man
brought
this
here
and
said
it
was
a
for
you
lina
understood
her
to
say
she
took
the
package
and
went
on
to
valchester
she
emptied
her
lapful
of
flowers
on
the
and
held
up
the
package
with
a
smile
some
one
has
sent
me
a
she
laughed
do
stop
to
examine
it
now
my
dear
said
valchester
we
have
no
time
to
lose
sit
down
here
by
me
and
let
us
tie
the
pansies
into
pretty
little
bunches
jaquelina
sat
down
obediently
and
valchester
said
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
lina
ronald
went
to
new
york
last
week
and
purchased
an
exquisite
set
of
jewelry
diamonds
and
large
pale
pearls
for
your
do
you
like
jewels
very
much
said
lina
but
i
have
never
possessed
any
except
few
trinkets
and
the
that
ronald
gave
me
ronald
does
not
mean
to
give
you
the
jewels
till
after
the
wedding
said
ronald
adoring
mother
he
has
a
poetic
fancy
for
you
to
wear
just
the
same
things
you
wore
when
he
first
met
you
of
course
that
would
never
do
in
a
fashionable
place
but
here
in
the
country
it
does
not
matter
so
much
to
give
him
his
way
ronald
is
very
fanciful
and
poetic
he
is
about
to
publish
a
volume
of
poems
i
am
sure
they
must
succeed
some
of
them
are
quite
byronic
so
ronald
fond
mother
rambled
on
to
his
while
with
her
own
white
jeweled
fingers
she
adjusted
the
beautiful
veil
on
the
girl
graceful
head
confining
it
with
knots
of
velvety
white
pansies
when
she
said
quite
proudly
you
are
finished
and
you
make
a
really
beautiful
bride
my
dear
lina
heart
gave
a
throb
of
rapture
at
the
praise
of
her
betrothed
mother
i
may
open
the
package
now
she
said
timidly
to
the
stately
old
lady
in
her
silk
and
real
laces
and
soft
puffs
of
gray
hair
yes
replied
valchester
for
i
suppose
you
are
impatient
to
see
what
token
of
kindness
one
of
your
friends
has
sent
to
you
jaquelina
removed
the
wrappings
and
found
a
small
painting
exquisitely
framed
in
ebony
and
silver
the
painting
represented
a
serpent
crushing
a
dove
beneath
it
was
written
in
a
fine
clear
feminine
hand
the
one
word
vendetta
valchester
looked
over
lina
shoulder
at
the
strange
lina
she
said
gravely
it
is
not
a
friend
who
has
sent
you
this
it
is
an
enemy
oh
how
cruel
said
the
girl
her
fair
cheeks
grew
pale
and
a
frightened
look
came
into
her
dark
eyes
who
could
have
done
it
said
valchester
you
an
enemy
my
child
a
female
enemy
this
is
the
writing
of
a
woman
i
do
not
know
a
woman
on
earth
who
dislikes
me
lina
replied
it
was
very
unkind
and
cruel
said
valchester
warmly
i
should
not
have
thought
anyone
could
be
so
cruel
as
to
try
and
frighten
you
thus
in
the
happiest
moment
of
your
life
it
is
very
strange
that
you
should
have
an
unknown
enemy
who
should
take
this
method
of
declaring
war
against
you
we
must
tell
ronald
about
it
and
see
if
he
can
have
any
idea
as
to
the
perpetrator
then
she
paused
and
lina
laid
the
threatening
upon
the
small
for
the
rumble
of
wheels
was
heard
below
ronald
valchester
had
come
for
his
bride
they
are
come
do
not
be
frightened
lina
said
valchester
smiling
as
the
sensitive
began
to
come
and
go
in
the
cheeks
of
the
girl
chapter
xix
the
small
congregation
of
the
pretty
little
country
chapel
where
jaquelina
was
to
be
married
was
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
equal
to
that
of
a
fashionable
city
church
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
had
gathered
in
the
aisles
to
witness
the
wedding
of
the
farmer
pretty
simple
niece
to
the
wealthy
and
aristocratic
ronald
valchester
there
was
the
usual
amount
of
gossip
and
small
talk
while
they
waited
for
the
bridal
party
to
appear
but
the
chat
was
mostly
jaquelina
meredith
had
always
been
an
object
of
pity
and
sympathy
to
the
neighbors
for
the
hard
life
she
had
lived
at
her
uncle
all
were
glad
that
she
had
made
what
is
termed
a
good
match
kind
and
friendly
hands
had
decorated
the
house
of
god
with
flowers
for
the
bridal
gentle
earle
had
sent
white
flowers
beneath
which
the
contracting
parties
were
to
stand
while
they
pledged
the
solemn
vows
the
path
from
the
gateway
to
the
churchdoor
was
literally
strewn
with
roses
kind
hearts
and
kind
wishes
waited
on
the
coming
of
the
gentle
young
bride
they
came
at
last
the
whisper
ran
from
lip
to
lip
the
joyous
notes
of
the
wedding
march
pealed
from
the
small
organ
the
minister
arose
and
stood
waiting
with
his
open
book
the
immediate
relatives
of
the
bride
and
groom
the
merediths
and
valchester
entered
first
with
and
earle
they
proceeded
to
the
seats
reserved
for
them
near
the
altar
amid
a
great
deal

subdued
whispering
over
their
appearance

the
elegant
dresses
of

and
the
groom

then
oh
how
beautiful
was
whispered
from

to

as
violet
earle
came
slowly
up
the
aisle
on
the
arm
of
her
handsome
brother

attired
in
an
exquisite
costume
of
white
lace
festooned
with
delicate
pink
geraniums
she
wore
gleaming
white
pearls
on
her
neck
and
wrists
and
carried
a
small
basket
of
delicate
pink
geraniums
on
her
arm
that
exhaled
a
delicate
perfume
as
she
passed
violet
i
never
saw
you
looking
so
pretty
as
you
do
walter
whispered
to
her
and
it
was
true
a
slight
air
of
restless
and
anxious
expectancy
lent
color
to
her
cheeks
and
fire
to
her
eyes
walter
himself
looked
handsome
but
very
pale
and
grave
he
had
not
conquered
his
own
heart
yet
and
he
walked
over
a
path
of
thorns
when
he
accompanied
his
friend
to
the
altar
it
was
a
strange
sight
to
see
this
brother
and
sister
acting
as
bridesmaid
and
groomsman
to
this
pair
walter
was
in
love
with
the
bride
violet
with
the
groom
yet
they
had
been
chosen
for
this
office
and
accepted
it
calmly
as
they
were
now
fulfilling
it
they
walked
to
the
front
of
the
altar
and
stepped

between

with
his

upon

and
stood
expectantly
before
the
clergyman
those
who
stood
around
said
that
there
never
had
been
a
bridegroom
or
a
lovelier
bride
valchester
calm
grave
face
was
very
pale
but
it
was
touched
with
a
beautiful
tender
seriousness
that
impressed
all
who
saw
it
with
his
deep
consciousness
of
the
sanctity
of
the
moment
the
beautiful
face
of
the
as
seen
through
the
mist
of
the
splendid
brussels
veil
glowed
with
shy
blushes
and
the
thick
curling
fringe
of
her
black
lashes
drooped
low
upon
her
cheek
a
moment
the
rustle
and
whisper
in
the
congregation
suddenly
grew
still
the
clergyman
began
to
read
the
solemnly
beautiful
words
of
the
marriage
service
everyone
was
looking
at
the
bride
no
one
noticed
that
violet
earle
as
she
stood
at
the
left
of
the
bride
looked
behind
her
with
an
anxious
fugitive
eager
gaze
but
the
next
moment
all
was
darkness
and
confusion
a
man
sprang
up
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
and
with
a
daring
hand
extinguished
the
pretty
chandelier
that
lighted
the
chapel
cries
of
alarm
and
indignation
arose
in
an
instant
all
was
hurry
noise
and
confusion
in
the
instant
that
the
light
was
extinguished
jaquelina
heard
a
low
cry
of
pain
from
her
lover
lips
felt
him
falling
to
the
floor
in
the
darkness
then
she
was
caught
in
a
pair
of
strong
arms
and
borne
rapidly
from
the
chapel
struggling
and
screaming
she
was
lifted
to
the
back
of
a
horse
and
borne
fleetly
away
in
the
arms
of
her
captor
in
the
hour
that
was
the
happiest
of
her
life

chapter

gradually
the
first
frantic
struggle
of
jaquelina
relaxed
in
violence
the
grief
and
horror
of
her
situation
overcame
her
nerves
she
fainted
and
hung
limp
and
nerveless
in
the
strong
arms
of
the
outlaw
it
is
better
thus
said
gerald
huntington
grimly
her
struggles
sadly
impeded
my
flight
now
i
will
put
my
horse
to
its
highest
speed
he
crushed
the
beautiful
senseless
white
burden
fiercely
against
his
breast
and
struck
the
spurs
into
the
sides
of
his
gallant
horse
urging
him
madly
forward
for
he
could
hear
in
the
distance
the
ringing
hoofs
of
the
animals
that
bore
hot
pursuers
upon
his
track
but
his
horse
one
of
the
swiftest
racers
in
the
country
and
the
start
he
had
had
precluded
the
possibility
of
being
overtaken
gradually
as
he
flew
over
the
long
white
road
he
lost
the
echo
of
the
pursuing
hoofs
they
might
follow
still
but
he
had
left
them
too
far
behind
to
fear
them
when
he
had
fully
realized
this
he
struck
into
the
woods
an
hour
hard
riding
brought
him
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
where
jaquelina
had
first
had
the
to
meet
him
he
dismounted
and
taking
the
still
senseless
girl
in
his
arms
blew
a
shrill
low
whistle
that
brought
a
man
to
care
for
his
horse
have
you
brought
the
priest
he
said
abruptly
to
this
man
yes
captain
he
in
waiting
was
the
respectful
reply
gerald
huntington
waited
for
no
more
he
strode
into
the
pitchy
darkness
of
the
cave
winding
in
and
out
through
its
tortuous
recesses
and
emerged
at
last
in
the
luxurious
apartment
which
was
specially
his
own
and
which
no
one
dared
to
enter
without
his
permission
all
the
while
the
beautiful
stolen
bride
lay
white
and
senseless
like
a
broken
lily
in
his
strong
arms
now
he
laid
her
down
on
a
silken
sofa
and
drawing
a
flask
of
wine
from
his
pocket
poured
a
few
drops
between
her
pale
parted
lips
and
chafed
her
cold
brow
and
hands
almost
before
he
knew
it
the
dark
eyes
opened
dreamily
and
stared
up
at
his
masked
face
in
bewilderment
then
gerald
huntington
again
repeated
his
peculiar
whistle
the
thick
velvet
hanging
parted
noiselessly
and
three
men
appeared
in
the
opening
they
manifested
no
surprise
at
the
unusual
sight
of
the
girl
lying
helplessly
on
the
sofa
they
evidently
knew
what
had
transpired
has
bowles
arrived
safely
from
the
chapel
inquired
captain
huntington
yes
captain
just
this
moment
was
the
reply
very
well
tell
him
to
come
in
with
the
priest
you
three
guard
the
different
approaches
until
you
receive
the
signal
to
take
away
the
priest
the
men
bowed
and
went
away
jaquelina
suddenly
regaining
her
strength
and
a
consciousness
sprang
wildly
to
her
feet
oh
my
god
she
cried
out
as
her
gaze
roved
wildly
around
the
luxurious
cavern
apartment
is
it
indeed
true
you
have
dared
to
bring
me
here
you
have
torn
me
from
she
stopped
with
a
moan
of
uncontrollable
anguish
i
have
torn
you
from
your
lover
very
arms
yes
echoed
gerald
huntington
with
a
scornful
laugh
did
i
not
warn
you
i
would
take
my
revenge
in
your
happiest
hour
cruel
implacable
wretch
jaquelina
cried
out
indignantly
her
dark
eyes
flashing
fiery
scorn
on
her
triumphant
enemy
oh
how
i
hate
your
very
sight
hush
hush
my
bonny
bride
said
gerald
huntington
with
mocking
tenderness
ere
long
i
will
teach
you
to
love
me
she
looked
at
him
with
parted
lips
and
dark
eyes
but
her
angry
beauty
did
not
move
him
his
wrath
was
roused
to
its
highest
pitch
against
her
passionate
love
and
passionate
hate
struggled
together
in
his
breast
the
heavy
curtains
parted
softly
again
and
bowles
entered
ushering
in
a
small
priest
gerald
huntington
caught
jaquelina
hand
forcibly
in
his
and
drew
her
forward
come
priest
we
are
waiting
he
said
with
haughty
impatience
make
us
man
and
wife
as
soon
as
you
can
oh
never
never
cried
his
captive
with
a
shriek
of
fear
and
terror
as
she
broke
loose
from
his
hold
and
fled
swiftly
toward
the
heavy
hangings
in
a
wild
effort
at
escape
but
as
she
pushed
aside
the
thick
curtains
a
dark
form
barred
her
farther
progress
gerald
huntington
came
toward
her
laughing
carelessly
at
her
cry
of
disappointment
not
so
fast
my
pretty
bird
he
said
you
are
caged
tight
and
fast
there
is
no
escape
for
you
i
have
determined
to
make
you
my
bride
whether
you
consent
or
not
you
can
not
she
broke
out
in
passionate
breathless
defiance
you
not
i
dare
do
anything
gerald
huntington
replied
proudly
and
he
proved
the
truth
of
his
words
by
seizing
her
firmly
by
one
arm
while
bowles
at
a
signal
from
his
chief
took
her
by
the
other
it
was
a
strange
sight
the
frightened
trembling
little
priest
standing
irresolute
in
the
center
of
the
large
apartment
and
the
lovely
young
girl
struggling
desperately
with
the
two
masked
outlaws
her
face
pale
and
convulsed
with
terror
her
dark
hair
streaming
in
dishevelled
ringlets
the
silvery
mist
of
her
bridal
veil
rent
and
torn
the
broken
white
pansies
falling
from
her
hair
and
her
breast
and
strewing
the
crimson
carpet
over
all
the
flickering
glare
of
the
lamplight
and
the
dark
sinister
faces
of
the
outlaws
peering
through
the
velvet
hangings
at
the
striking
scene
the
little
priest
who
had
been
decoyed
to
the
cave
by
a
clever
story
of
a
in
the
country
though
frightened
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
in
that
terrible
place
felt
moved
to
utter
a
feeble
protest
if
the
young
lady
is
not
willing
he
ventured
it
is
not
right
to
marry
her
against
her
will
gerald
huntington
turned
on
him
sternly
reverend
sir
he
said
haughtily
we
have
not
asked
for
your
opinion
you
are
here
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
marriage
proceed
with
it
to
refuse
or
even
to
hesitate
will
be
at
your
deadly
peril
his
white
hand
went
into
his
breast
and
the
priest
heard
the
click
of
a
weapon
with
a
throbbing
heart
and
faltering
voice
he
began
to
mumble
forth
the
words
of
the
marriage
service
bowles
and
his
master
held
jaquelina
firmly
between
them
gerald
huntington
made
every
response
in
a
loud
clear
triumphant
voice
but
jaquelina
head
drooped
on
her
breast
while
her
whole
slight
frame
was
benumbed
by
a
sick
and
shuddering
horror
a
terrible
hopeless
despair
was
stamped
upon
her
white
and
haggard
features
i
pronounce
you
man
and
wife
and
whom
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
said
the
priest
feeble
quivering
voice
at
last
and
the
bride
drooped
forward
and
fell
like
one
dead
at
the
feet
of
her
lawful
master
chapter
xxi
gerald
huntington
lifted
his
unconscious
bride
and
laid
her
again
on
the
sofa
bowles
hurried
the
not
unwilling
priest
from
the
room
the
outlaw
chief
was
alone
with
the
beautiful
senseless
form
of
the
hapless
girl
whom
he
had
torn
from
the
side
of
her
lover
before
the
very
altar
and
forced
away
to
share
the
terrible
life
of
a
criminal
who
was
in
hiding
from
the
stern
arm
of
justice
he
knelt
down
by
her
side
and
took
her
small
white
hand
in
both
his
own
she
fell
before
i
could
place
the
on
her
finger
he
said
i
will
do
so
now
but
in
lifting
her
hand
he
saw
a
diamond
ring
sparkling
on
one
slender
finger
he
tore
it
off
quickly
and
a
spasm
of
jealous
rage
convulsed
the
handsome
features
from
which
he
had
cast
aside
the
disfiguring
mask
valchester
gift
doubtless
he
said
holding
it
scornfully
on
the
tip
of
his
finger
let
us
see
what
dainty
motto
the
poet
chose
for
his
darling
he
held
the
sparkling
circlet
up
to
the
light
and
read
the
fine
lines
cut
deeply
within
it
peur
et
sans
reproche
then
a
groan
forced
itself
through
his
lips
that
had
grown
suddenly
cold
and
pallid
ah
my
god
the
motto
how
comes
it
on
the
hand
of
this
child
but
the
pale
silent
lips
of
the
wronged
girl
made
him
no
answer
she
lay
still
with
the
dark
fringe
of
her
lashes
lying
low
upon
her
white
cheek
his
eye
caught
the
gleam
of
a
golden
locket
lying
on
her
breast
ah
he
cried
jealously
tearing
it
open
my
rival
dreamy
face
perhaps
a
woman
curl
soft
and
dark
fell
from
the
locket
into
his
hand
and
seemed
to
twine
about
his
fingers
as
if
in
tenderness
he
shut
it
into
his
hand
and
looked
for
the
expected
picture
of
the
hated
rival
two
faces
smiled
out
upon
him
one
was
a
man
gentle
tender
dreamy
handsome
the
other
a
face
dark
and
lovely
with
a
luring
charm
about
its
vivid
beauty
the
fury
the
passion
the
jealous
rage
died
out
of
the
outlaw
face
as
he
gazed
his
fierce
dark
eyes
grew
soft
then
startled
and
the
whiteness
of
death
overspread
his
face
he
opened
his
hand
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
long
curling
tress
my
god
he
uttered
and
his
eyes
roved
from
the
fair
face
in
the
picture
to
that
of
the
still
unconscious
girl
something
in
the
strange
likeness
of
the
two
affected
him
terribly
can
it
be
he
said
aloud
and
as
if
he
had
asked
her
a
question
the
white
lids
of
jaquelina
fluttered
upward
and
she
fixed
her
dark
eyes
upon
him
then
she
saw
that
he
held
her
treasured
locket
open
in
his
hand
and
a
gleam
of
anger
flashed
from
her
eyes
how
dare
you
she
cried
trying
to
wrench
it
from
him
but
the
outlaw
caught
the
weak
little
hands
and
held
them
tightly
girl
he
said
hoarsely
tell
me
whose
faces
are
these
you
wear
upon
your
breast
something
in
his
strong
repressed
agitation
forced
a
reply
from
jaquelina
pale
lips
they
are
those
of
my
father
and
mother
she
replied
wonderingly
your
mother
maiden
name
he
asked
fixing
his
dark
magnetic
eyes
upon
her
face
and
again
some
power
that
seemed
beyond
her
own
volition
held
her
passionate
anger
in
abeyance
and
forced
her
to
reply
quietly
the
man
started
a
groan
of
agony
forced
itself
between
his
bloodless
lips
for
god
sake
i
ask
you
for
god
sake
tell
me
all
you
know
of
your
mother
he
exclaimed
in
low
tense
accents
while
his
black
eyes
seemed
to
burn
with
inward
fire
i
know
very
little
to
tell
you
she
said
with
increasing
wonder
at
his
fearful
agitation
for
great
drops
of
dew
beaded
his
high
white
brow
i
have
told
you
her
name
was
jaqueline
ardelle
my
father
married
her
in
the
south
of
france
he
was
an
artist
and
fell
in
love
with
her
beauty
he
brought
her
home
with
him
and
when
i
was
born
she
died
and
this
was
her
hair
her
ring
her
locket
he
said
as
she
paused
and
then
jaquelina
saw
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
taken
her
mother
ring
from
her
finger
she
reached
out
her
hand
for
it
as
she
said
sadly
yes
that
was
her
ring
and
her
locket
and
that
was
a
curl
they
cut
off
for
papa
after
she
was
dead
and
this
dress
i
have
on
now
was
my
mother
there
was
a
pause
the
dark
eyes
of
the
outlaw
were
fixed
on
the
curl
in
his
hand
its
silken
tendrils
seemed
to
twine
about
his
hand
caressingly
give
me
the
curl
i
will
put
it
back
in
the
locket
said
the
girl
rising
abruptly
to
a
sitting
posture
no
no
the
outlaw
murmured
dreamily
like
one
talking
in
his
sleep
give
it
to
me
jaquelina
repeated
half
angrily
it
is
mine
mine
then
gerald
huntington
sprang
to
his
feet
and
towered
above
her
in
his
princely
hight
and
satanic
beauty
his
face
was
livid
his
eyes
flashed
fire
he
threw
the
silken
curl
into
her
lap
with
a
muttered
curse
take
it
he
cried
madly
take
it
and
with
my
curse
i
am
baffled
baffled
in
the
moment
of
my
revenge
the
golden
wine
of
happiness
has
turned
to
poison
on
my
lips
i
have
loved
you
madly
and
made
you
my
bride
but
you
can
never
be
of
mine
these
arms
may
never
hold
you
these
lips
never
press
your
own
go
girl
go
out
of
my
sight
forever
go
before
in
the
madness
of
my
love
and
despair
i
lay
you
dead
at
my
feet
jaquelina
needed
no
second
bidding
the
outlaw
chief
had
turned
away
with
his
dark
face
hidden
in
his
hands
she
slipped
from
her
seat
and
gliding
softly
across
the
carpeted
floor
passed
between
the
heavy
velvet
hangings
and
disappeared
in
the
perilous
gloom
and
darkness
of
the
cave
beyond
leaving
the
outlaw
chief
solitary
and
alone
stricken
by
some
mysterious
blighting
secret
chapter

they
found
ronald
valchester
lying
like
one
dead
upon
the
floor
before
the
altar
the
abductor
of
his
bride
had
given
him
a
murderous
thrust
from
a
knife
in
the
dark
and
his
snowy
vest
was
dyed
with
the
crimson
current
that
poured
from
his
side
he
was
in
a
deep
and
swoon
and
when
he
opened
his
dim
eyes
again
he
found
himself
supported
on
the
white
arm
of
violet
earle
while
a
flood
of
tears
rained
from
her
dark
blue
eyes
the
doctors
came
and
examined
him
they
found
that
the
wound
was
not
so
bad
as
was
at
first
supposed
it
was
a
in
the
left
lung
and
though
dangerous
not
necessarily
fatal
they
thought
the
assassin
had
aimed
for
the
heart
but
had
missed
it
in
the
darkness
they
carried
him
to
laurel
hill
and
walter
earle
and
every
other
man
in
the
neighborhood
set
out
on
a
hot
pursuit
of
the
daring
abductor
of
the
beautiful
public
indignation
was
thoroughly
aroused
and
public
opinion
pointed
unerringly
to
the
perpetrator
of
the
terrible
outrage
all
remembered
that
gerald
huntington
had
sworn
an
oath
of
vengeance
against
jaquelina
meredith
the
night
on
which
she
had
effected
his
capture
meanwhile
ronald
valchester
lying
in
a
cool
white
chamber
at
laurel
hill
and
lovingly
tended
by
careful
hands
was
racked
by
the
pain
of
his
wound
and
the
still
greater
anguish
of
his
mental
suffering
he
had
lost
her
his
bonny
bride
she
had
been
torn
from
his
side
in
the
very
moment
when
she
was
about
to
be
made
his
own
forever
one
question
fevered
and
tormented
his
harassed
mind
to
what
terrible
fate
had
his
darling
been
devoted
by
her
ruthless
foe
he
moaned
and
tossed
in
restless
delirium
all
night
they
could
not
soothe
him
opiates
failed
utterly
of
effect
the
doctors
said
it
was
very
bad
for
his
wound
if
a
fever
set
in
they
could
not
answer
for
the
consequences
but
the
terribly
bereaved
bridegroom
heeded
nothing
they
said
he
lay
all
night
with
his
eager
restless
eyes
fixed
upon
the
door
whenever
anyone
entered
he
would
ask
them
if
they
had
heard
anything
if
walter
had
returned
and
a
dozen
other
anxious
questions
that
were
always
answered
in
the
negative
but
in
the
golden
dawn
of
the
new
day
walter
earle
rode
into
the
his
horse
was
panting
and
flecked
with
foam
his
master
looked
weary
and
jaded
but
there
was
a
light
of
eager
joy
in
his
face
he
threw
the
reins
to
a
servant
and
hurried
away
to
the
wounded
bridegroom
room
valchester
heavy
eyes
still
fixed
yearningly
on
the
door
grew
bright
with
joy
at
his
friend
entrance
walter
you
bring
me
news
he
cried
eagerly
and
walter
answered
with
a
quiver
of
joy
in
his
voice
yes
val
we
have
found
her
found
her
valchester
echoed
from
her
place
beside
the
bed
where
she
was
fanning
her
son
found
her
earle
cried
joyfully
from
the
washstand
where
she
was
preparing
iced
cloths
for
ronald
heated
brow
but
ronald
was
stricken
dumb
by
that
joyful
answer
he
lay
still
pressing
walter
hand
tightly
in
perfect
silence
his
whole
eloquent
face
expressing
his
exceeding
joy
and
thankfulness
it
was
earle
who
asked
after
a
moment
walter
where
did
you
find
the
poor
child
in
the
woods
mother
where
she
had
dragged
herself
until
she
could
go
no
further
she
was
very
weak
and
exhausted
is
it
possible
she
had
escaped
from
her
captor
exclaimed
valchester
so
it
seems
said
walter
but
she
was
too
weary
and
exhausted
to
give
us
any
information
scarcely
we
have
taken
her
home
and
when
she
is
rested
and
somewhat
recovered
she
will
tell
us
all
when
did
you
find
her
ronald
asked
faintly
a
little
past
midnight
lying
like
a
little
white
heap
under
a
tree
walter
replied
she
was
quite
unconscious
and
only
rallied
after
we
reached
the
farm
with
her
she
could
only
answer
a
few
questions
and
we
would
not
weary
her
she
was
very
nervous
and
seemed
disinclined
for
speech
oh
that
i
were
well
enough
to
go
to
her
groaned
ronald
walter
earle
looked
at
the
pale
eager
face
compassionately
valchester
do
not
worry
yourself
he
said
kindly
it
is
not
good
for
you
lina
will
come
to
you
the
moment
she
is
able
she
said
she
would
and
her
uncle
said
that
he
would
bring
her
try
and
be
patient
a
few
hours
if
he
would
only
sleep
said
valchester
eagerly
the
doctor
said
he
must
be
very
quiet
and
sleep
a
good
deal
but
he
has
never
even
closed
his
eyes
and
he
watching
the
door
constantly
and
asking
wild
questions
of
everyone
walter
looked
at
the
pale
worn
face
of
the
wounded
man
he
knew
in
his
heart
what
the
anguish
of
that
night
had
been
to
him
poor
old
val
he
said
gently
how
could
he
help
it
it
was
hard
to
bear
the
misery
and
the
terrible
suspense
but
now
that
lina
is
safe
he
will
compose
himself
and
go
to
sleep
as
you
wish
him
will
you
not
ronald
he
inquired
in
a
soothing
tone
i
will
try
he
answered
and
closed
his
eyes
obediently
but
every
now
and
then
when
they
thought
him
asleep
a
nervous
start
or
a
twitching
of
the
would
betray
the
wakefulness
and
excitement
which
he
was
patiently
striving
to
overcome
but
happiness
is
a
potent
medicine
they
knew
that
ere
long
his
relieved
mind
would
succumb
to
its
own
weariness
so
they
darkened
the
room
and
kept
very
still
waiting
anxiously
for
the
moment
when
tired
nature
sweet
restorer
balmy
sleep
should
fold
her
pinions
over
his
weary
pillow
then
walter
himself
weary
and
worn
with
a
night
hard
riding
stole
from
the
room
to
seek
rest
and
comfort
on
his
own
downy
couch
outside
the
door
he
encountered
his
sister
restlessly
hovering
in
the
hall
her
fair
face
strangely
pallid
a
frightened
gleam
in
her
large
blue
eyes
walter
she
whispered
fearfully
is
it
true
what
i
heard
you
saying
just
now
that
lina
meredith
is
really
found
yes
it
is
true
he
answered
are
you
not
glad
violet
a
strange
expression
that
walter
could
not
understand
came
over
the
pallid
face
of
the
girl
i
can
scarcely
credit
it
she
cried
out
in
astonishment
come
walter
i
will
go
with
you
to
your
room
and
you
shall
tell
me
all
about
it
she
went
with
him
to
his
quiet
room
but
she
could
gain
no
more
from
him
than
she
had
already
heard
him
telling
ronald
valchester
a
look
of
disappointment
came
over
her
lovely
blonde
face
she
left
walter
and
went
away
to
her
own
room
where
she
threw
herself
down
upon
her
snowy
couch
and
wept
the
bitterest
tears
that
had
ever
fallen
from
those
lovely
eyes
gerald
huntington
has
played
me
false
she
told
herself
he
has
let
her
go
after
all
the
risks
i
ran
for
him
oh
how
could
he
be
so
base
so
cruel
what
shall
i
do
now
oh
what
shall
i
do
weeping
and
sighing
violet
wrung
her
hands
and
hid
her
anguished
face
in
the
pillow
she
had
dared
and
risked
so
much
to
remove
her
hated
rival
from
her
path
and
all
had
failed
in
the
afternoon
ronald
valchester
fell
into
a
long
refreshing
sleep
when
he
awakened
feeling
wonderfully
calmed
and
refreshed
his
first
question
was
for
his
little
lina
my
dear
i
do
not
think
she
has
come
yet
said
the
gentle
mother
patiently
watching
by
his
bedside
be
patient
she
will
come
mother
will
you
just
step
down
and
see
if
they
have
heard
any
more
from
her
valchester
moved
quietly
away
the
invalid
lay
still
with
eyes
watching
the
last
flickering
beams
of
sunshine
as
they
lay
in
golden
bars
upon
the
floor
then
although
he
had
heard
no
footsteps
he
saw
the
shadow
of
a
woman
lying
across
the
sunbeams
on
the
floor
he
looked
up
quickly
and
saw
a
small
white
figure
in
the
doorway
with
a
wan
white
face
and
great
dark
eyes
that
looked
at
him
sorrowfully
yet
eagerly
lina
lina
my
darling
he
cried
out
extending
his
eager
arms
toward
her
chapter
xxiii
at
that
loving
call
jaquelina
staggered
across
the
floor
to
bedside
she
laid
her
wan
white
face
upon
his
own
and
kissed
him
through
a
rain
of
bitter
tears
oh
my
poor
poor
murdered
love
she
sobbed
wildly
if
you
should
die
your
poor
lina
must
die
too
ronald
arm
stole
around
the
slender
form
lovingly
it
is
not
so
bad
as
that
dear
he
said
i
shall
get
well
please
god
and
we
shall
be
married
soon
nay
why
should
we
not
have
the
holy
man
come
and
unite
us
at
this
very
hour
would
it
not
be
the
best
lina
darling
then
you
would
belong
to
me
and
be
my
own
patient
loving
little
nurse
believe
me
i
should
get
well
all
the
faster
but
jaquelina
had
drawn
back
from
his
caress
with
a
sudden
cry
of
pain
he
put
out
his
hand
with
a
smile
to
draw
her
back
and
then
he
saw
that
her
small
white
hands
were
cut
and
bruised
and
that
a
linen
bandage
was
swathed
about
her
right
arm
oh
my
poor
little
lina
he
cried
your
hands
are
cruelly
bruised
and
torn
who
has
done
this
wicked
brutal
deed
her
lips
quivered
as
he
took
her
hands
gently
and
pressed
them
to
his
lips
the
large
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
brimmed
over
on
her
pale
cheeks
no
one
has
done
it
ronald
she
said
falteringly
i
crawled
on
my
hands
and
knees
through
a
long
dark
perilous
cave
and
the
sharp
rocks
bruised
and
wounded
me
but
i
did
not
care
for
i
was
so
glad
to
get
away
that
i
did
not
feel
the
pain
look
at
this
she
said
turning
back
a
corner
of
the
bandage
on
her
arm
ronald
looked
and
shivered
there
was
a
terrible
jagged
wound
on
the
fair
round
arm
and
the
flesh
around
it
was
fearfully
bruised
and
discolored
there
were
horses
tethered
in
the
cave
she
whispered
it
was
pitch
black
i
could
see
nothing
i
must
have
crawled
beneath
their
very
feet
and
one
struck
his
hoof
out
in
the
darkness
and
kicked
this
arm
then
by
a
merciful
providence
i
was
enabled
to
turn
aside
out
of
the
range
of
their
hoofs
oh
i
can
not
tell
you
ronald
how
terrible
it
was
creeping
through
that
fearful
place
you
were
in
the
very
den
of
the
outlaws
he
exclaimed
yes
she
answered
with
a
shudder
and
you
escaped
from
them
my
brave
little
girl
he
cried
oh
thank
god
you
were
saved
from
the
vindictive
power
of
that
man
lina
i
can
not
rest
easy
one
moment
now
until
i
have
the
right
to
watch
over
every
moment
of
your
life
i
must
take
you
far
away
from
here
she
trembled
at
the
passionate
dread
in
his
voice
then
rallied
bravely
do
not
fear
for
me
she
said
he
will
not
molest
me
again
ronald
but
ronald
shook
his
head
i
shall
never
know
one
moment
peace
until
you
are
my
own
he
said
lina
i
shall
send
for
the
minister
and
you
shall
be
my
wife
without
one
moment
delay
you
are
willing
are
you
not
my
little
love
the
girl
clasped
her
small
bruised
hands
together
and
her
pale
face
grew
paler
still
with
anguish
oh
pitiful
heaven
she
wailed
how
can
i
tell
you
the
truth
my
own
ronald
he
looked
at
her
in
wonder
lina
what
is
it
he
asked
you
will
not
refuse
to
marry
me
here
and
now
you
can
not
be
so
cruel
think
love
you
would
have
been
my
wife
last
night
if
all
had
gone
well
and
you
can
not
now
refuse
my
prayer
to
make
you
mine
in
the
moment
of
my
suffering
and
sorrow
think
what
a
comfort
it
would
be
to
me
to
have
my
own
little
wife
for
my
patient
loving
nurse
or
perhaps
that
would
be
too
great
a
burden
for
you
lina
no
no
it
would
be
too
great
a
pleasure
she
replied
eagerly
how
could
i
think
any
task
performed
for
you
would
be
a
burden
ronald
then
you
will
marry
me
lina
will
you
not
my
darling
she
looked
at
the
pale
handsome
face
with
its
anxious
eyes
and
winning
smile
and
her
heart
gave
a
great
suffocating
throb
of
terrible
pain
ronald
i
can
not
she
said
falteringly
then
he
said
that
is
too
soon
she
answered
looking
away
from
him
that
he
might
not
see
the
pain
in
her
face
we
must
defer
it
let
us
wait
until
you
get
well
an
expression
of
the
keenest
disappointment
came
over
the
handsome
face
lina
i
thought
you
loved
me
better
than
that
he
said
reproachfully
what
reason
can
there
be
for
waiting
so
long
there
is
a
very
important
reason
she
replied
tremblingly
tell
me
what
it
is
said
ronald
he
thought
it
was
only
some
small
feminine
scruple
he
could
easily
overcome
she
looked
at
him
hesitating
strangely
she
had
moved
a
little
way
from
him
and
stood
with
her
hand
resting
easily
on
the
back
of
a
chair
while
her
long
lashes
drooped
and
a
crimson
flush
tinted
her
face
tell
me
what
it
is
he
said
again
is
it
that
the
pretty
is
ruined
lina
never
mind
that
the
one
you
are
wearing
will
do
perfectly
well
it
is
a
greater
obstacle
than
that
she
faltered
but
it
may
be
overcome
after
awhile
uncle
says
so
and
walter
earle
i
have
told
him
too
says
that
it
will
all
come
right
lina
come
here
to
my
side
and
put
both
your
hands
in
mine
said
ronald
valchester
she
obeyed
him
though
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
now
look
straight
into
my
eyes
and
let
me
see
if
you
are
quite
sane
he
said
she
lifted
her
long
lashes
obediently
and
looked
at
him
he
started
as
those
dark
eyes
met
his
own
they
were
dim
and
heavy
with
almost
intolerable
anguish
oh
heaven
my
darling
what
mystery
is
this
he
cried
out
fearfully
lina
what
has
happened
to
part
us
she
shivered
as
though
the
very
words
hurt
her
it
is
only
for
a
little
while
she
said
in
a
low
and
faltering
tone
uncle
charlie
has
promised
to
do
all
he
can
for
us
it
is
bitter
to
bear
ronald
but
it
will
all
come
right
lina
you
drive
me
mad
he
cried
hoarsely
and
she
saw
that
his
face
was
pallid
as
death
and
his
eyes
wild
and
frightened
go
my
child
send
walter
earle
to
me
perhaps
he
will
tell
me
the
truth
a
look
of
resolute
endurance
came
into
the
pathetic
young
face
no
she
said
i
will
tell
you
myself
they
said
i
could
break
it
to
you
more
gently
perhaps
i
may
help
you
to
bear
it
oh
my
darling
do
not
look
at
me
so
hard
i
would
have
died
rather
than
this
should
have
happened
the
sight
of
her
anguish
almost
maddened
ronald
valchester
lina
i
can
not
bear
this
suspense
any
longer
he
cried
tell
me
why
you
will
not
marry
me
she
came
nearer
she
took
both
his
hands
and
held
them
in
her
own
she
looked
at
him
with
brave
patient
eyes
oh
ronald
my
best
beloved
she
said
trying
to
speak
calmly
and
bravely
you
must
remember
while
i
am
telling
you
that
it
will
not
be
for
long
the
obstacle
shall
be
removed
uncle
charlie
has
promised
me
but
i
can
not
be
your
wife
now
because
oh
ronald
because
against
my
own
will
i
am
already
married
to
another
a
terrible
pause
the
eyes
looking
up
into
the
black
ones
grew
dark
with
intense
emotion
the
handsome
face
grew
in
its
awful
pallor
lina
he
gasped
then
words
failed
him
yes
ronald
she
said
last
night
that
man
had
a
priest
in
his
awful
cave
he
read
the
ceremony
of
marriage
over
gerald
huntington
and
myself
he
pronounced
us
man
and
wife
but
ronald
uncle
charlie
will
get
a
divorce
for
me
and
i
will
marry
you
as
soon
as
i
am
free
ronald
she
stopped
in
terror
he
had
turned
suddenly
upon
his
side
and
after
a
low
gasping
sound
in
his
throat
and
one
quiver
of
the
limbs
lay
still
with
the
bluish
pallor
of
death
on
his
face
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
heart
but
there
was
no
movement
ronald
is
dead
she
cried
and
her
wail
of
anguish
through
the
house
chapter
xxiv
jaquelina
wail
of
anguish
penetrated
to
every
ear
in
the
house
those
who
had
sent
her
alone
to
break
the
terrible
news
to
ronald
came
hurrying
in
now
and
found
her
weeping
and
wringing
her
hands
and
wildly
calling
on
ronald
to
speak
to
her
once
more
ronald
is
dead
she
cried
to
them
i
tried
to
tell
him
gently
but
he
could
not
bear
it
it
has
killed
him
oh
my
darling
my
darling
walter
earle
hurried
to
the
bedside
while
the
shrieks
of
the
women
filled
the
room
he
pushed
jaquelina
gently
aside
and
bent
over
the
still
form
of
his
friend
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
quiet
heart
do
not
tell
me
that
he
is
dead
my
only
child
my
precious
ronald
cried
the
frightened
mother
walter
was
silent
he
felt
the
cold
hands
the
still
heart
over
and
over
again
at
last
he
turned
to
his
mother
who
stood
weeping
by
his
side
i
can
not
believe
he
is
dead
he
said
i
can
feel
no
pulse
and
no
beat
of
the
heart
yet
it
is
possible
that
he
is
only
prostrated
by
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
he
may
possibly
revive
send
for
the
doctor
immediately
then
he
saw
that
valchester
had
fainted
and
that
jaquelina
chafing
her
cold
hands
and
bathing
them
with
her
tears
he
lifted
the
form
of
the
insensible
woman
and
bore
her
into
the
next
room
lina
you
must
come
in
here
and
you
too
violet
he
said
you
must
do
what
you
can
for
valchester
i
do
not
believe
that
ronald
is
dead
i
will
try
every
means
to
revive
him
he
left
them
and
went
back
to
ronald
who
still
lay
like
one
dead
on
his
pillow
with
all
that
lina
and
violet
could
do
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
could
rouse
valchester
from
her
deep
swoon
in
the
meantime
they
could
hear
the
hurrying
footsteps
coming
and
going
in
ronald
room
the
doctor
had
been
sent
for
and
arrived
but
it
was
an
hour
before
earle
came
softly
into
the
room
and
said
with
gentle
joy
on
her
sweet
face
walter
was
right
ronald
is
living
living
they
echoed
and
then
the
three
women
wept
for
joy
the
mother
who
had
borne
him
the
girl
who
was
to
have
been
his
wife
and
violet
who
loved
him
secretly
and
vainly
he
was
living
but
life
hung
on
the
merest
thread
no
one
could
be
admitted
into
the
room
that
night
but
the
doctor
and
walter
earle
and
his
mother
he
was
unable
to
bear
even
the
joyful
excitement
his
own
mother
could
not
have
suppressed
on
seeing
him
he
was
nervous
and
restless
the
doctor
stayed
with
him
all
night
he
slept
for
a
few
hours
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
opiate
then
vivid
consciousness
and
memory
returned
he
pleaded
with
the
physician
for
a
boon
which
was
firmly
refused
but
in
the
glimmering
dawn
of
the
new
day
which
had
come
in
rainy
and
damp
and
sunless
the
physician
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
next
room
where
the
sleepless
watchers
waited
for
the
hourly
bulletins
that
came
from
the
sufferer
he
wishes
to
see
miss
meredith
he
said
gravely
and
not
me
valchester
cried
yes
if
i
would
permit
it
said
the
doctor
but
i
am
afraid
of
the
excitement
i
can
admit
but
one
at
the
time
and
miss
meredith
must
go
first
he
has
asked
for
her
so
often
i
can
no
longer
refuse
his
prayer
jaquelina
rose
from
her
crouching
attitude
in
which
she
had
remained
cramped
on
the
all
night
shivering
and
wretched
you
must
go
to
him
alone
said
the
kindly
physician
he
wishes
it
so
earnestly
try
to
be
very
calm
my
child
agree
to
everything
he
says
if
he
becomes
excited
call
me
into
the
room
jaquelina
went
very
quietly
though
her
dark
eyes
shone
like
stars
she
did
not
know
with
what
a
baleful
gaze
violet
watched
her
as
she
went
into
that
room
where
the
idol
of
both
their
hearts
waited
for
her
coming
they
listened
fearful
of
some
excited
cry
but
no
sound
came
from
the
next
room
save
a
murmur
of
low
hushed
voices
in
a
very
little
while
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
at
the
most
the
door
opened
and
jaquelina
came
out
again
my
dear
the
old
physician
cried
out
in
alarm
and
he
went
up
to
her
involuntarily
the
strange
pallor
on
her
beautiful
young
face
frightened
him
she
lifted
her
heavy
dark
eyes
that
seemed
to
have
no
light
or
beauty
left
in
them
any
more
and
looked
up
at
him
doctor
leslie
she
said
will
you
let
his
mother
go
to
him
now
he
is
not
excited
i
think
he
is
quite
calm
but
perhaps
his
mother
may
comfort
him
she
went
out
into
the
hall
the
next
moment
no
one
thought
of
stopping
her
her
strange
appearance
had
almost
frightened
them
doctor
leslie
led
valchester
quietly
into
her
son
room
jaquelina
went
softly
and
took
her
shawl
and
hat
from
the
rack
in
the
hall
she
put
them
on
mechanically
and
stole
quietly
out
of
the
house
into
the
chilly
rainy
world
that
lay
outside
she
walked
quietly
along
the
wet
and
sodden
path
across
the
lawn
little
dreaming
that
walter
earle
had
observed
her
from
an
upper
window
and
was
hastening
after
her
she
turned
with
a
start
at
his
light
touch
upon
her
arm
lina
what
does
this
mean
he
cried
i
am
going
home
she
said
with
hard
dry
lips
not
in
the
rain
said
walter
the
walk
is
too
far
i
will
drive
you
over
in
the
phaeton
after
breakfast
i
must
go
now
she
said
pushing
on
resolutely
through
the
chilling
autumn
drizzle
i
do
not
mind
the
walk
i
do
not
understand
you
lina
he
said
gravely
why
did
you
not
wait
and
see
valchester
he
will
be
very
disappointed
at
your
going
i
have
seen
him
she
replied
still
walking
on
doctor
leslie
allowed
me
to
go
in
a
few
minutes
walter
could
not
understand
her
strange
gravity
and
quietude
it
seemed
as
if
years
had
suddenly
fallen
on
the
bright
young
head
and
made
of
her
a
mature
and
thoughtful
woman
you
will
come
back
and
see
ronald
again
he
said
interrogatively
she
lifted
her
heavy
eyes
and
gave
him
one
swift
look
whose
hopeless
despair
never
passed
from
his
memory
i
shall
never
see
valchester
again
she
said
mournfully
never
why
not
lina
he
cried
surprised
he
has
given
me
up
she
said
why
walter
queried
again
in
bewilderment
it
will
be
all
right
after
your
uncle
charles
obtains
a
divorce
for
you
will
it
not
she
looked
at
him
again
with
those
heavy
hopeless
eyes
no
never
again
she
said
valchester
has
told
me
that
he
does
not
believe
that
human
law
can
repeal
a
union
cemented
by
a
priest
of
god
he
does
not
believe
in
divorces
as
long
as
gerald
huntington
lives
he
believes
i
am
bound
to
him
valchester
is
mad
delirious
walter
muttered
indignantly
for
myself
i
hold
that
it
was
no
marriage
at
all
they
were
nearing
the
lawn
gates
and
in
a
moment
she
looked
up
at
him
earle
she
said
we
are
almost
at
the
lawn
gates
will
you
excuse
me
if
i
go
on
alone
from
here
you
are
very
kind
but
it
seems
to
me
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
a
human
face
walter
bowed
and
turned
back
silently
leaving
her
to
pursue
her
walk
alone
chapter
xxv
when
walter
earle
parted
from
jaquelina
at
the
lawn
gates
he
went
back
to
the
house
with
two
distinct
thoughts
in
his
mind
one
was
a
feeling
of
indignation
and
surprise
against
ronald
valchester
he
was
amazed
at
learning
that
his
friend
was
an
unbeliever
in
divorces
he
firmly
resolved
to
give
ronald
a
lecture
on
the
subject
when
he
should
be
sufficiently
recovered
to
argue
the
case
his
second
thought
which
he
could
not
help
entertaining
was
that
since
affairs
had
taken
this
peculiar
turn
there
was
some
hope
still
for
himself
after
the
divorce
is
granted
i
will
do
my
utmost
to
them
he
said
still
loyal
to
ronald
and
lina
in
spite
of
his
love
for
her
and
then
if
i
fail
of
converting
ronald
i
will
woo
little
lina
for
myself
ronald
could
not
accuse
me
of
disloyalty
to
him
in
that
case
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
ronald
valchester
defection
must
place
his
own
suit
in
a
better
light
before
jaquelina
eyes
the
divorce
from
the
outlaw
was
only
a
question
of
time
walter
thought
they
could
not
fail
to
grant
it
indeed
it
seemed
to
walter
that
it
could
scarcely
be
viewed
as
a
marriage
at
all
jaquelina
once
freed
from
its
fetters
she
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
indignant
at
view
of
the
case
and
once
over
the
smart
of
her
pain
it
seemed
to
walter
that
his
own
loyal
love
could
not
fail
to
find
favor
in
her
eyes
and
then
who
knows
mused
walter
jaquelina
once
out
of
his
reach
and
by
his
own
decision
too
the
heart
of
valchester
may
in
time
turn
to
violet
poor
little
violet
she
has
borne
her
pain
bravely
but
i
am
certain
that
she
has
not
got
over
it
yet
in
spite
of
his
sympathy
for
the
sadly
and
strangely
parted
lovers
walter
could
not
repress
a
glow
of
satisfaction
at
the
thought
that
after
all
his
own
happiness
and
that
of
his
sister
might
be
secured
by
the
strange
events
that
had
seemed
so
deplorable
at
first
yet
he
resolved
that
he
would
first
do
all
he
could
to
change
opinion
of
divorces
he
went
back
to
the
and
found
his
friend
very
ill
and
weak
the
doctor
warned
him
there
must
be
no
talking
his
patient
could
not
bear
to
be
excited
he
lay
back
upon
the
pillow
his
handsome
face
pale
as
marble
the
long
dark
lashes
lying
motionless
on
his
cheek
yet
they
knew
that
he
was
not
asleep
only
spent
and
exhausted
by
the
tempest
of
emotion
that
had
passed
over
him
his
mother
sat
quietly
by
the
looking
pale
and
sad
and
in
the
gray
morning
light
she
had
telegraphed
for
general
valchester
and
looked
anxiously
for
his
arrival
at
any
hour
of
the
day
as
the
day
wore
on
the
wound
developed
a
dangerous
phase
fever
and
delirium
set
in
ronald
pale
face
grew
scarlet
his
dim
eyes
bright
with
fever
fires
he
tossed
restlessly
on
his
pillows
and
babbled
ceaselessly
of
his
loved
lina
interspersing
his
flighty
murmurs
with
poetical
quotations
hiawatha
wooing
seemed
to
linger
in
his
mind
like
a
pleasant
dream
he
would
murmur
over
and
over
pleasant
was
the
journey
homeward
all
the
birds
sang
loud
and
sweetly
and
again
over
wide
and
rushing
rivers
in
his
arms
he
bore
the
maiden
at
noon
general
valchester
arrived
he
had
a
brief
private
interview
with
leslie
then
they
telegraphed
for
a
celebrated
richmond
physician
the
brooding
shadows
of
the
wing
hung
dark
and
heavy
over
laurel
hill
in
the
rainy
dreary
sunset
charlie
meredith
drove
over
in
his
buggy
i
would
have
come
sooner
he
said
but
i
have
been
to
town
to
consult
a
lawyer
for
my
niece
so
when
i
got
home
and
wife
told
me
lina
had
never
got
back
i
thought
i
drive
over
and
inquire
after
valchester
and
fetch
her
home
if
she
a
mind
to
go
earle
to
whom
he
was
talking
looked
at
him
with
a
start
of
surprise
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
valchester
is
in
a
very
critical
condition
he
replied
after
his
father
came
up
at
noon
he
immediately
telegraphed
for
a
physician
from
richmond
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
said
meredith
perhaps
then
my
niece
will
not
be
ready
to
go
home
yet
and
again
earle
looked
surprised
miss
meredith
went
home
at
daylight
this
morning
he
answered
eh
what
i
do
think
i
understand
you
said
charlie
meredith
your
niece
went
home
at
daylight
this
morning
earle
repeated
the
farmer
healthy
brown
skin
turned
pale
he
looked
dazed
earle
you
must
be
mistaken
he
said
lina
has
never
been
home
she
walked
over
here
yesterday
afternoon
and
she
has
not
been
at
home
since
she
certainly
left
laurel
hill
early
this
morning
earle
said
perplexed
walter
walked
with
her
to
the
lawn
gates
he
wished
to
drive
her
over
in
the
phaeton
but
she
declined
so
he
told
me
and
insisted
on
going
home
alone
i
sincerely
trust
that
no
harm
has
befallen
little
lina
meredith
looked
grave
and
a
good
deal
troubled
is
it
not
strange
she
should
have
started
home
so
soon
in
the
morning
i
can
not
understand
it
walter
came
out
just
then
he
grew
pale
when
they
told
him
that
jaquelina
had
never
come
home
that
day
he
remembered
what
a
hopeless
despair
had
looked
at
him
from
the
dark
eyes
and
the
fair
young
face
when
they
parted
and
yet
i
never
dreamed
of
anything
wrong
he
said
to
himself
with
a
pang
of
pain
at
his
heart
oh
why
did
i
let
her
go
alone
i
should
have
known
better
from
the
look
on
her
face
he
said
aloud
more
cheerfully
than
he
felt
perhaps
she
grew
weary
and
stopped
in
at
some
of
the
neighbors
to
rest
i
will
go
with
you
to
inquire
mr
meredith
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
said
the
farmer
i
think
it
is
very
likely
you
have
hit
on
the
truth
walter
she
must
have
grown
tired
and
stopped
in
at
some
of
the
neighbors
and
you
may
perhaps
find
her
already
at
home
when
you
reach
there
said
earle
who
thought
that
his
son
idea
was
the
correct
one
but
walter
was
not
so
sanguine
he
got
into
the
buggy
and
drove
away
with
meredith
but
he
was
not
surprised
when
one
neighbor
after
another
declared
that
jaquelina
had
not
been
seen
by
any
one
of
them
that
day
all
inquiry
and
all
search
failed
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
her
disappearance
no
one
had
seen
her
since
she
turned
away
from
walter
earle
at
the
lawn
gates
that
morning
and
when
he
remembered
the
look
upon
her
face
that
moment
he
shuddered
and
thought
of
the
river
he
told
meredith
of
his
fears
the
next
day
the
river
was
dragged
but
to
no
avail
jaquelina
had
vanished
as
utterly
as
if
the
solid
earth
had
opened
beneath
her
feet
and
received
her
into
its
bosom
many
believed
that
gerald
huntington
had
carried
her
off
again
and
a
party
was
organized
to
explore
the
woods
in
the
hope
of
discovering
the
cave
which
jaquelina
had
described
to
them
as
the
rendezvous
of
the
outlaws
chapter
xxvi
it
was
decided
that
ronald
valchester
should
not
hear
of
strange
disappearance
already
he
lay
at
death
door
and
the
physicians
declared
that
another
shock
of
any
kind
would
utterly
destroy
his
frail
hold
on
life
as
consciousness
returned
to
him
they
avoided
all
mention
of
that
once
familiar
name
in
the
yet
they
knew
many
a
time
by
the
look
in
the
beautiful
eyes
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
girl
he
had
loved
so
well
and
lost
so
sadly
sometimes
they
wondered
why
he
never
spoke
of
her
they
did
not
know
how
ronald
and
lina
had
parted
how
sorrowfully
he
had
said
to
her
even
as
he
held
the
small
hands
tightly
in
his
own
and
looked
at
her
with
a
soul
despair
stamped
on
his
death
white
face
lina
this
is
the
last
time
i
must
hold
your
hands
or
even
look
into
your
face
while
gerald
huntington
lives
you
are
legally
his
and
i
have
never
believed
in
divorce
if
the
law
were
to
free
you
i
should
still
hold
you
bound
to
him
by
a
higher
power
than
man
law
so
you
understand
dear
it
is
best
we
should
separate
wholly
never
perhaps
to
look
on
each
other
faces
again
i
pray
god
that
i
may
die
and
so
pass
from
this
life
that
but
a
little
while
ago
was
so
fair
and
tempting
in
my
eyes
and
that
is
now
but
an
empty
desert
for
you
my
sweet
lost
love
may
god
bless
you
and
give
us
both
the
strength
to
bear
the
heavy
cross
of
sorrow
and
jaquelina
remembering
doctor
leslie
words
that
he
must
not
be
excited
or
contradicted
in
any
way
had
bowed
her
head
and
answered
meekly
it
must
be
so
if
you
will
it
thus
ronald
god
give
us
both
the
patience
to
bear
it
and
with
those
words
and
one
last
lingering
look
at
the
beloved
face
jaquelina
had
kissed
his
hands
and
gone
away
but
she
had
not
let
him
see
that
look
on
her
face
that
the
others
had
seen
that
hopeless
despair
and
pain
that
it
frightened
walter
earle
to
remember
so
they
kept
the
story
away
from
ronald
even
while
the
unspoken
language
of
his
eyes
said
plainer
than
words
i
am
longing
to
hear
something
of
my
poor
lost
love
even
to
hear
her
name
spoken
aloud
would
be
a
relief
since
it
is
ever
ringing
itself
in
my
brain
but
no
one
spoke
of
her
no
one
seemed
to
remember
her
existence
it
seemed
to
ronald
that
they
were
cruel
to
be
so
forgetful
he
had
placed
a
seal
upon
his
own
lips
but
he
would
have
trembled
with
pleasure
if
anyone
else
had
even
named
her
name
day
by
day
there
began
to
be
some
slight
change
in
ronald
faint
at
first
but
growing
more
and
more
noticeable
the
doctors
began
to
have
hopes
of
him
they
thought
it
more
than
likely
he
would
pull
through
safely
now
yet
they
owned
that
there
would
long
be
a
weakness
in
that
wounded
lung
and
they
strenuously
recommended
a
sea
voyage
to
him
when
he
should
be
sufficiently
recovered
to
undertake
it
a
sea
voyage
a
winter
in
italy
said
doctor
sanborn
would
build
up
your
constitution
make
a
new
man
of
you
and
lend
new
wings
to
your
soaring
fancy
laughed
doctor
leslie
who
had
found
out
that
ronald
was
a
poet
i
should
say
that
beautiful
dreamy
italy
is
the
true
home
of
the
poetic
muse
ronald
fell
in
with
the
plan
at
once
the
more
eagerly
that
he
felt
it
would
be
best
to
put
the
whole
width
of
the
world
between
himself
and
jaquelina
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
were
farther
away
that
he
must
cease
to
be
tormented
by
that
passionate
yearning
for
the
lost
one
that
haunted
him
now
forever
but
there
were
weary
days
of
lingering
pain
and
slow
convalescence
to
be
passed
over
before
that
sea
voyage
could
be
undertaken
the
red
and
gold
of
the
october
leaves
blew
in
drifts
across
the
lawn
and
in
the
wood
before
he
was
ever
out
of
his
room
meanwhile
his
thoughts
in
spite
of
himself
were
ever
busy
with
jaquelina
he
pictured
her
to
himself
many
times
daily
he
wondered
how
she
spent
her
time
he
wondered
if
she
had
gone
away
to
teach
as
she
had
meant
to
do
before
their
evanescent
dream
of
happiness
that
fancy
pained
him
it
retarded
his
convalescence
it
kept
him
restless
and
wakeful
at
night
he
learned
the
full
meaning
of
the
poet
plaints
when
we
most
need
rest
and
the
perfect
sleep
some
hand
will
reach
from
the
dark
and
keep
the
curtains
drawn
and
the
pillows
tossed
like
a
tide
of
foam
and
one
will
say
at
night
oh
heaven
that
it
were
day
and
one
by
night
through
the
misty
tears
will
say
oh
heaven
the
days
are
years
and
i
would
to
heaven
that
the
waves
were
crossed
general
valchester
had
returned
home
when
his
son
was
declared
out
of
danger
but
his
wife
remained
to
nurse
and
tend
her
darling
she
was
growing
very
impatient
to
take
him
home
to
richmond
it
was
a
happy
day
for
violet
earle
when
the
invalid
was
at
last
able
to
come
down
into
the
and
rest
on
the
snowy
pillows
that
she
eagerly
arranged
for
him
she
had
not
been
admitted
to
the
much
but
for
the
few
days
he
would
remain
with
them
she
determined
that
she
would
do
her
best
to
win
him
jaquelina
was
out
of
the
way
now
and
she
had
a
fair
field
for
her
operations
as
she
sat
near
the
sunny
window
with
her
dainty
basket
of
bright
colored
silks
and
embroideries
ronald
eyes
could
rest
on
her
without
the
trouble
of
turning
his
head
and
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
was
very
fair
and
beautiful
she
had
spent
a
long
time
at
her
toilet
that
morning
and
the
result
was
a
very
dainty
and
charming
toilet
a
morning
dress
of
cashmere
with
front
facings
of
shirred
satin
made
a
perfect
foil
to
her
fair
skin
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
a
delicate
fichu
of
lace
was
knotted
around
her
throat
and
fastened
on
her
breast
by
a
cluster
of
pale
pink
begonias
the
delicate
hands
flashing
in
and
out
through
the
bright
colors
of
the
embroidery
were
soft
and
white
and
gleaming
with
jewels
valchester
was
charmed
with
her
she
wished
very
much
that
her
son
would
take
a
fancy
to
her
since
he
had
lost
the
girl
he
loved
at
first
but
violet
presence
was
more
of
a
pain
than
a
pleasure
to
ronald
valchester
she
made
him
think
all
the
more
of
jaquelina
he
had
seen
them
so
often
together
i
wish
you
were
well
enough
to
go
out
and
walk
in
the
woods
she
said
to
him
lifting
her
blue
eyes
a
moment
to
look
at
him
you
would
be
delighted
with
their
autumn
beauty
i
sent
you
yesterday
a
little
basket
of
leaves
the
brightest
and
prettiest
i
could
find
did
mamma
give
them
to
you
yes
but
i
think
she
forgot
to
tell
me
you
had
sent
them
he
replied
thank
you
for
thinking
of
me
so
kindly
they
were
very
beautiful
i
enjoyed
looking
at
them
very
much
violet
pushed
back
the
lace
curtains
that
he
might
look
out
at
the
distant
hills
with
their
vivid
coloring
of
scarlet
and
gold
blent
with
the
dark
green
of
holly
and
cedar
and
evergreen
the
autumn
sunshine
lay
over
all
the
scene
brightening
it
with
its
mellow
light
and
adding
new
beauty
to
the
prospect
ronald
gazed
on
it
long
and
unweariedly
and
he
could
not
help
seeing
pretty
violet
too
for
she
sat
between
him
and
the
window
with
the
golden
light
shining
on
her
sunny
hair
how
beautiful
it
all
is
ronald
said
with
a
passing
gleam
of
enthusiasm
the
light
is
so
soft
and
clear
the
air
so
sweet
and
those
distant
mountains
look
so
blue
and
beautiful
it
seems
to
me
that
italy
can
scarcely
be
lovelier
than
my
own
native
land
violet
folded
her
white
hands
on
her
work
and
looked
at
him
earnestly
oh
valchester
i
want
you
to
promise
me
one
thing
she
exclaimed
he
looked
at
her
in
some
surprise
what
can
it
be
he
inquired
rather
gravely
only
this
she
said
that
you
will
write
to
walter
every
week
while
you
are
gone
and
describe
all
the
beauties
of
art
and
nature
which
you
encounter
in
your
travels
i
do
so
love
italy
and
long
to
see
it
and
if
you
describe
it
in
your
letters
graphically
as
i
know
you
will
do
it
will
be
almost
like
seeing
it
myself
for
i
will
insist
on
reading
all
walter
letters
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
fond
of
the
beauties
of
nature
miss
earle
he
replied
in
some
surprise
and
the
color
rose
in
her
fair
cheeks
i
am
very
fond
of
nature
she
replied
but
you
have
not
promised
me
yet
that
you
will
write
to
my
brother
as
i
said
of
course
i
shall
write
to
walter
he
said
but
i
can
not
promise
that
my
letters
will
be
very
interesting
perhaps
you
would
prefer
to
hear
me
describe
my
travels
when
i
return
oh
yes
that
would
be
delightful
violet
cried
all
smiles
and
pleasure
so
then
you
promise
me
to
come
to
laurel
hill
when
you
return
and
describe
italy
to
me
oh
yes
i
will
come
he
replied
carelessly
but
i
dare
say
you
will
be
married
and
gone
to
a
home
of
your
own
before
that
time
oh
no
indeed
she
cried
out
quickly
if
you
stay
ten
years
you
will
find
me
at
laurel
hill
when
you
return
it
will
be
quite
a
wonder
if
he
does
then
said
valchester
who
had
entered
and
overheard
the
last
remarks
it
is
not
likely
that
the
young
men
of
virginia
will
allow
such
a
pretty
girl
to
remain
at
laurel
hill
ten
years
longer
violet
laughed
and
blushed
and
protested
that
she
would
never
marry
but
ronald
agreed
with
his
mother
that
it
was
quite
unlikely
she
should
remain
an
old
maid
she
was
exceedingly
pretty
for
such
a
fate
chapter
xxvii
ronald
valchester
grew
very
tired
of
the
of
invalid
his
mother
and
earle
and
violet
all
vied
in
attentions
to
him
they
were
always
arranging
his
pillows
bringing
him
flowers
and
fussing
over
him
as
walter
laughingly
termed
it
the
young
man
was
growing
exceedingly
impatient
he
declared
that
he
was
well
enough
to
go
back
to
richmond
and
doctor
leslie
at
last
agreed
with
him
so
they
decided
one
day
to
start
the
next
day
for
home
in
the
meantime
ronald
had
enjoyed
a
few
rides
in
pretty
little
phaeton
with
walter
or
violet
as
his
companion
the
cool
bracing
air
of
autumn
made
him
feel
stronger
and
better
valchester
thought
she
would
soon
have
him
well
when
once
she
had
taken
him
home
with
her
violet
she
said
the
afternoon
of
the
day
on
which
they
were
to
leave
that
night
walter
is
going
down
to
richmond
with
us
i
wish
you
would
go
also
can
not
you
go
dear
violet
looked
up
with
a
deep
flush
of
pleasure
crimsoning
her
cheeks
if
mamma
is
willing
i
can
see
no
reason
to
prevent
she
said
her
heart
beating
high
at
the
thought
for
she
had
been
grieving
over
the
thoughts
of
the
near
departure
of
the
man
she
loved
so
vainly
you
must
ask
your
papa
love
replied
earle
with
placid
unconsciousness
papa
and
walter
are
going
over
to
the
town
said
violet
unable
to
conceal
her
disappointment
they
are
on
some
odious
law
business
and
if
i
wait
for
their
return
it
is
quite
likely
i
shall
not
have
time
to
pack
my
trunk
so
you
will
have
to
excuse
me
mrs
valchester
ronald
looked
across
at
her
from
over
the
top
of
the
book
he
was
apparently
reading
he
saw
that
she
was
disappointed
though
he
had
no
idea
of
the
reason
he
did
not
dream
that
violet
loved
him
he
thought
she
was
simply
like
other
girls
weary
of
the
monotony
of
country
life
and
longing
for
the
gaiety
of
the
city
if
you
will
let
me
have
a
horse
earle
he
said
i
will
ride
over
to
the
town
and
hasten
the
truants
back
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
bear
exercise
otherwise
i
have
no
objection
replied
earle
i
am
quite
strong
enough
protested
ronald
you
ladies
are
keeping
me
an
invalid
too
long
a
mile
ride
through
this
pleasant
air
would
brace
me
up
i
believe
it
would
do
me
good
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
take
the
phaeton
suggested
violet
who
saw
therein
a
chance
to
accompany
him
but
ronald
insisted
that
exercise
would
please
him
best
and
the
three
ladies
yielded
the
point
and
allowed
him
to
have
his
own
way
it
was
very
unwise
of
ronald
perhaps
but
his
passionate
hunger
to
see
jaquelina
again
had
been
mainly
instrumental
in
sending
him
out
that
evening
the
perfect
silence
everyone
maintained
regarding
her
instead
of
cooling
the
fever
of
his
heart
added
new
fires
to
it
although
his
peculiar
views
regarding
divorce
precluded
the
idea
that
they
should
ever
be
aught
to
each
other
again
he
could
not
cease
to
love
her
it
is
quite
impossible
i
should
ever
cease
to
love
her
he
said
to
himself
as
he
rode
along
under
the
interlacing
boughs
of
the
trees
i
long
to
see
her
again
to
hear
her
voice
to
touch
her
hand
and
yet
i
know
that
i
am
unwise
but
if
they
had
talked
to
me
about
her
if
they
had
even
called
her
name
i
think
i
could
have
borne
it
better
the
strange
silence
they
keep
maddens
me
with
suspense
it
is
just
as
if
my
lost
little
lina
were
dead
he
sighed
deeply
and
the
thought
came
to
him
that
it
were
better
indeed
if
she
were
dead
better
than
this
separation
he
wondered
if
lina
was
as
miserable
over
it
as
he
found
himself
he
persuaded
himself
that
it
would
not
be
wrong
to
go
and
bid
lina
a
last
farewell
and
tell
her
that
he
was
going
away
far
away
in
the
hope
of
forgetting
her
he
could
not
leave
the
neighborhood
without
one
more
look
in
the
dark
eyes
that
had
won
his
heart
it
seemed
to
him
that
one
look
into
the
fair
young
face
one
sound
of
the
winning
voice
would
cool
the
fever
and
thirst
of
his
heart
he
turned
into
the
road
that
led
to
meredith
farm
and
almost
before
he
knew
it
found
himself
dismounted
and
tying
the
to
the
orchard
gate
then
he
opened
the
gate
and
went
down
the
path
expecting
every
moment
to
come
upon
lina
under
the
trees
reading
or
dreaming
as
of
old
his
pale
face
flushed
his
heart
beat
quick
his
whole
frame
trembled
with
the
pain
and
pleasure
of
seeing
jaquelina
again
he
walked
on
full
of
the
thought
of
the
girl
he
loved
so
wildly
and
came
upon
an
unexpected
tableau
meredith
was
under
a
tree
with
a
basket
busily
filling
it
with
great
winter
apples
little
dollie
frisking
beside
her
uttered
a
cry
and
she
looked
around
oh
mr
valchester
she
exclaimed
surprised
and
embarrassed
at
his
sudden
appearance
meredith
he
replied
in
equal
surprise
and
confusion
i
have
come
to
bid
lina
i
am
going
home
can
you
tell
me
where
to
find
her
meredith
straightened
up
and
looked
at
him
in
surprise
she
did
not
know
how
carefully
they
had
kept
the
truth
from
him
my
dear
sir
i
wish
i
tell
you
she
said
full
of
a
certain
remorseful
pity
over
poor
jaquelina
fate
we
hai
never
heard
a
word
since
she
went
away
went
away
where
asked
ronald
valchester
blankly
then
he
added
at
her
look
of
surprise
i
thought
she
was
at
home
all
the
time
oh
dear
me
cried
meredith
why
she
disappeared
all
of
a
sudden
sir
the
very
day
that
she
left
laurel
hill
after
visiting
you
there
walter
was
the
last
person
that
ever
saw
her
we
have
never
seen
nor
heard
of
her
since
and
meredith
nigh
crazy
over
it
did
walter
never
tell
you
sir
but
ronald
valchester
did
not
stay
to
answer
her
he
turned
away
like
one
in
a
dream
and
walked
back
to
the
gate
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
as
though
on
an
errand
of
life
or
death

years
again

on
the
grass
again
the
roses
shed
their
leaves
and
left
the
thorns
again
the
golden
sunlight
lay
over
the
earth
as
it
did
that
autumn
three
years
gone
when
the
tragedy
of
sorrow
fell
between
ronald
valchester
and
the
dawning
happiness
of
his
life
in
one
of
the
most
palatial
hotels
of
new
york
a
lady
sat
in
her
luxurious
parlor
a
lovely
morning
in
that
sunny
autumn
she
was
young
and
beautiful
so
beautiful
that
the
eye
never
wearied
of
gazing
on
the
light
of
the
large
dark
eyes
the
dainty
contour
of
the
cheek
and
throat
and
the
delicate
lovely
coloring
of
the
scarlet
lips
curved
like
cupid
bow
that
rich
tinting
of
the
lips
was
all
the
color
in
her
face
the
cheek
was
pale
and
clear
the
brow
was
and
so
transparent
you
could
see
the
blue
veins
outlined
clearly
in
the
temples
the
abundant
chestnut
hair
with
a
glint
of
gold
in
its
brownness
was
drawn
back
in
waving
masses
from
the
thoughtful
brow
and
arranged
in
rich
confusion
of
braids
and
ringlets
fastened
with
a
comb
of
gold
and
pearl
she
wore
a
morning
gown
of
royal
purple
velvet
trimmed
with
snowy
swansdown
and
lingered
near
the
fire
as
if
the
chill
in
the
autumn
air
made
itself
felt
even
amid
the
luxurious
comfort
of
her
surroundings
the
door
opened
and
an
old
gentleman
entered
with
an
of
papers
the
lady
looked
up
with
a
gentle
smile
ah
professor
she
cried
you
have
not
turned
newsboy
i
hope
the
handsome
old
gentleman
with
his
gray
hair
and
slightly
foreign
face
laughed
genially
as
he
laid
his
burden
down
on
the
small
reading
table
and
wheeled
it
to
her
side
ah
my
dear
only
read
these
he
exclaimed
enthusiastically
your
first
appearance
was
a
perfect
success
all
new
york
is
at
your
feet
a
slight
sad
smile
came
over
the
beautiful
face
with
its
subtle
touch
of
melancholy
so
they
praise
me
she
said
carelessly
tell
me
what
they
say
professor
i
could
not
begin
to
tell
you
said
the
old
gentleman
you
must
read
the
papers
she
glanced
at
the
formidable
heap
with
an
expression
of
dismay
i
really
have
not
the
time
she
said
i
have
to
study
my
part
for
i
will
just
look
at
one
however
i
suppose
one
will
be
a
fair
epitome
of
all
the
rest
yes
about
that
he
replied
they
are
all
unanimous
in
praising
you
they
declare
that
madam
dolores
is
the
queen
of
the
lyric
stage
they
are
very
kind
replied
madam
dolores
carelessly
with
the
languid
air
of
one
who
is
accustomed
to
praise
and
almost
indifferent
to
it
she
took
up
at
random
a
morning
paper
smelling
freshly
of
ink
and
ran
her
eyes
over
its
columns
several
columns
were
devoted
to
a
description
of
the
brilliant
first
appearance
and
splendid
success
of
the
lovely
who
had
just
come
to
new
york
from
europe
with
all
the
of
a
brilliant
foreign
reputation
fresh
upon
her
the
professor
sat
down
and
dived
eagerly
into
the
papers
while
madam
dolores
rapidly
gleaned
the
contents
of
the
one
she
held
presently
she
looked
around
at
her
companion
with
an
eager
light
in
her
dark
eyes
and
a
sudden
flush
on
her
dark
cheeks
professor
she
said
pointing
one
taper
finger
to
a
paragraph
here
is
a
book
i
should
like
to
read
will
you
send
out
and
get
it
for
me
the
professor
looked
at
the
words
under
her
finger
poems
by
he
read
certainly
my
dear
rising
then
at
the
door
he
turned
and
said
who
my
child
some
american
poet
said
madam
dolores
carelessly
with
her
head
turned
away
the
door
closed
between
them
and
a
long
long
sigh
quivered
over
the
lips
of
the
beautiful
with
the
sorrowful
name
she
hid
her
face
in
her
beautiful
hands
poems
she
murmured
almost
inaudibly
it
will
be
almost
like
meeting
him
face
to
face
oh
ronald
ronald
you
would
not
have
thought
to
see
that
slender
figure
bowed
so
sorrowfully
there
that
all
new
york
was
raving
over
her
beauty
and
her
genius
but
it
was
true
madam
dolores
as
she
called
herself
had
been
induced
to
come
to
america
by
a
new
york
manager
who
wished
to
bring
out
an
opera
by
an
author
who
desired
to
remain
unknown
for
the
present
it
was
rumored
that
the
gentleman
had
already
achieved
fame
as
a
poet
but
beyond
that
fact
which
the
manager
did
not
deny
no
one
even
remotely
guessed
the
name
neither
money
nor
pains
had
been
spared
to
bring
the
opera
out
successfully
madam
dolores
who
had
just
completed
a
successful
starring
tour
abroad
was
engaged
at
immense
expense
to
bring
it
out
the
result
was
success
laurels
for
the
brow
of
the
composer
and
new
laurels
for
the
brow
of
the
singer
yet
no
smile
of
triumph
touched
the
fair
face
of
the
lovely
queen
of
song
as
she
sat
there
waiting
it
was
full
of
a
wistful
pathos
that
sometime
deepened
into
pain
it
was
full
of
poetry
and
passion
and
sorrow
there
was
no
light
of
gladness
in
the
large
and
bright
dark
eyes
yet
they
were
both
brave
and
tender
it
was
only
when
she
was
singing
that
any
brightness
came
into
the
grave
sad
face
then
she
lost
herself
like
a
true
in
the
part
she
sang
she
looked
up
quickly
as
the
professor
entered
with
the
book
for
which
she
had
sent
him
her
white
hand
trembled
as
she
took
the
beautiful
volume
thank
you
she
said
and
her
voice
was
so
husky
and
low
that
the
professor
her
teacher
and
adviser
looked
at
her
anxiously
dolores
your
voice
sounds
hoarse
he
said
i
fear
you
will
not
be
in
voice
for
never
fear
she
replied
in
a
clearer
tone
and
then
she
turned
away
from
him
and
while
he
pored
over
the
papers
glorying
in
the
praises
they
showered
on
his
gifted
ward
she
sat
silent
in
the
great
velvet
with
the
beautiful
volume
shut
tightly
between
her
folded
hands
she
was
not
quite
strong
enough
to
open
it
yet
it
seemed
like
a
message
from
the
dead
ronald
valchester
was
as
one
dead
to
her
forever
yet
the
best
part
of
her
lost
lover
the
heart
deep
tenderness
the
imperishable
proud
poetic
soul
seemed
throbbing
beneath
the
warm
clasp
of
her
hand
it
was
several
minutes
before
she
could
open
the
book
she
who
had
always
loved
music
and
poetry
so
dearly
sat
trembling
with
her
poems
in
her
hands
and
could
not
read
them
she
was
dizzy
there
was
a
mist
before
her
eyes
the
luxurious
room
seemed
to
fade
before
her
giving
place
to
the
green
hills
and
dales
of
her
old
virginia
home
she
felt
the
cold
winds
whispering
among
the
trees
and
lifting
the
careless
curls
from
her
brow
she
smelt
the
violets
hidden
in
the
green
she
recalled
the
old
simple
lonely
life
which
had
been
glorified
for
a
little
while
by
ronald
valchester
love
then
with
a
start
she
came
back
to
the
present
of
that
life
and
of
that
lover
there
remained
to
her
only
a
memory
now
and
this
she
said
opening
the
beautiful
book
and
trembling
all
over
as
she
read
the
dainty
verses
into
which
her
lost
lover
had
poured
all
the
poetry
and
passion
of
a
gifted
mind
and
tender
heart
she
read
on
and
on
they
touched
her
strangely
these
gems
of
thought
and
feeling
some
were
very
sad
and
tender
some
seemed
to
have
poured
straight
from
ronald
heart
into
her
own
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
written
them
for
her
for
her
only
she
became
quite
lost
in
them
and
oblivious
to
everything
else
she
did
not
hear
the
professor
steal
out
and
close
the
door
gently
behind
him
the
outer
world
had
no
place
in
her
thoughts
for
awhile
she
started
when
a
hand
was
laid
upon
her
head
and
looked
up
with
a
cry
but
it
was
only
the
old
professor
wife
who
was
like
a
mother
to
her
oh
forgive
me
darling
said
the
sweet
old
lady
i
did
not
mean
to
startle
you
but
only
look
at
these
flowers
she
put
a
bouquet
into
the
hand
an
exquisite
collection
of
rare
and
odorous
flowers
there
was
not
a
scentless
leaf
or
flower
in
the
bouquet
the
delicate
living
fragrance
floated
deliciously
through
the
room
sent
them
the
author
of
the
opera
himself
cried
mrs
professor
delightedly
he
is
coming
with
the
manager
to
call
on
you
this
afternoon
very
well
said
madam
dolores
resignedly
please
tell
my
maid
to
put
the
flowers
in
water
and
call
me
when
it
time
to
dress
why
my
dear
it
time
now
this
minute
you
have
been
lost
in
that
book
for
hours
twice
i
looked
into
the
room
and
went
out
again
because
you
were
so
absorbed
i
had
the
heart
to
disturb
you
but
now
really
there
is
another
minute
to
lose
i
told
fanchette
to
lay
out
a
handsome
dress
for
you
and
dear
i
think
it
would
be
a
graceful
compliment
to
the
author
to
wear
a
few
of
these
flowers
in
your
hair
very
well
said
madam
dolores
again
as
she
rose
and
passed
into
the
still
clasping
the
precious
book
in
her
hand
what
will
madame
wear
inquired
the
trim
french
maid
anything
it
does
not
matter
was
the
careless
reply
as
madam
dolores
threw
herself
into
a
chair
to
have
her
hair
rearranged
and
opened
her
book
again
she
could
not
bear
to
lose
a
minute
from
its
pages
fanchette
had
the
true
french
taste
for
style
and
elegance
she
selected
a
robe
of
black
lace
and
black
satin
embroidered
with
jet
then
she
took
some
fragrant
white
from
the
author
bouquet
and
fastened
them
at
the
front
of
the
square
corsage
and
tied
a
black
velvet
ribbon
around
the
slender
column
of
the
white
throat
she
wore
no
ornament
except
the
pearl
cross
that
swung
from
the
velvet
ribbon
and
a
diamond
on
her
finger
no
costume
could
have
enhanced
the
beauty
of
the
queen
of
song
more
superbly
the
lustrous
satin
set
off
the
creamy
fairness
of
cheek
and
throat
and
brow
exquisitely
and
made
the
soft
darkness
of
eyes
and
hair
more
lovely
by
the
contrast
but
madam
dolores
was
so
impatient
she
forgot
to
glance
into
the
long
swinging
mirror
when
fanchette
said
she
was
finished
she
took
up
poems
and
went
back
to
the
parlor
hoping
to
get
a
minute
more
for
reading
before
her
visitors
came
so
when
professor
larue
ushered
manager
verne
and
the
author
into
the
room
madam
dolores
had
utterly
forgotten
their
existence
she
was
in
a
great
velvet
chair
her
cheek
in
the
hollow
of
one
small
hand
the
dark
fringed
lashes
almost
sweeping
her
cheek
as
she
pored
over
the
volume
that
lay
open
on
her
knee
they
were
fairly
in
the
house
before
she
heard
them
then
she
rose
with
a
deep
beautiful
blush
that
faded
instantly
into
marble
pallor
for
glancing
instinctively
past
the
manager
she
saw
a
tall
handsome
man
with
eyes
like
twilight
skies
and
dark
hair
thrown
carelessly
back
from
a
high
white
brow
she
heard
the
manager
say
courteously
madam
dolores
allow
me
to
present
to
you
valchester
the
composer
of
the
opera
over
which
all
new
york
has
gone
wild
with
delight
madam
dolores
murmured
some
indistinct
words
in
reply
and
made
a
low
bow
to
the
author
but
she
did
not
offer
him
her
hand
it
hung
at
her
side
still
mechanically
grasping
the
book
of
poems
valchester
complimented
and
congratulated
her
on
her
successful
appearance
last
night
and
then
thanked
her
in
eloquent
terms
for
the
part
she
had
taken
in
making
his
venture
such
a
signal
success
both
were
grave
and
courteous
and
calm
no
one
who
witnessed
the
meeting
would
have
suspected
that
they
had
parted
only
three
years
ago
and
longing
for
death
in
that
moment
of
quiet
recognition
each
believed
that
the
other
had
outlived
the
passion
which
a
little
while
ago
had
seemed
the
all
in
all
of
life
then
the
manager
excused
himself
and
went
out
with
the
professor
the
author
and
the
singer
were
left
alone
in
the
luxurious
parlor
to
entertain
each
other
they
sat
silently
a
moment
then
valchester
said
calmly
you
were
reading
madam
dolores
she
looked
down
at
the
book
in
her
hand
and
the
color
rushed
into
her
cheeks
as
she
answered
yes
chapter
xxix
will
you
permit
me
to
see
what
author
engages
your
attention
said
ronald
valchester
and
the
singer
quietly
laid
the
book
in
his
hand
he
opened
it
and
she
smiled
very
faintly
as
she
saw
the
sensitive
color
mount
to
his
cheeks
i
presume
they
are
your
own
poems
mr
valchester
she
said
and
he
shivered
at
the
sweetness
of
her
low
voice
the
rushing
tide
of
memory
poured
over
his
soul
overwhelmingly
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
fully
at
the
beautiful
woman
yes
they
are
mine
he
answered
trembling
as
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
met
his
own
as
they
held
his
glance
a
moment
he
saw
how
grave
and
sad
they
were
and
the
white
brow
suggested
lines
he
had
somewhere
read
how
noble
and
calm
was
that
forehead
its
tresses
of
dark
waving
hair
the
sadness
of
thought
slept
upon
it
and
a
look
that
a
seraph
might
wear
ah
valchester
she
said
lightly
it
seemed
to
him
i
told
you
long
ago
that
you
were
a
poet
and
you
denied
it
he
bent
toward
her
eagerly
his
eyes
growing
bright
and
dark
with
excitement
then
it
really
you
lina
he
cried
i
thought
i
believed
it
was
so
but
i
was
afraid
to
speak
his
deep
voice
quivered
with
emotion
of
the
two
she
seemed
much
the
calmer
only
the
marble
pallor
of
her
cheek
showed
her
intense
repressed
agitation
yes
it
is
lina
she
said
with
apparent
calmness
are
you
surprised
mr
valchester
lina
we
have
mourned
you
as
dead
he
said
unsteadily
there
were
few
to
mourn
me
she
replied
and
there
was
a
note
of
bitterness
in
the
musical
voice
there
was
a
moment
embarrassed
silence
valchester
twirled
the
leaves
of
the
book
in
his
hand
jaquelina
looked
at
the
floor
tell
me
something
of
the
earles
and
my
uncle
she
said
it
is
so
long
three
years
since
i
have
heard
the
earles
are
in
new
york
they
came
expressly
to
hear
you
sing
last
night
he
replied
they
did
not
know
she
said
then
paused
abruptly
that
madam
dolores
was
little
lina
he
said
no
but
in
the
first
moment
when
you
came
upon
the
stage
we
were
struck
by
the
resemblance
violet
was
positively
agitated
yet
she
refused
to
entertain
the
idea
that
it
could
really
be
you
you
see
she
had
always
felt
convinced
that
you
were
dead
or
that
he
paused
and
she
could
see
the
shudder
that
shook
the
strong
handsome
form
you
had
met
a
more
terrible
fate
and
you
did
you
believe
in
my
identity
she
asked
calmly
and
a
little
curiously
yes
he
answered
unfalteringly
i
knew
there
was
no
other
face
or
voice
on
earth
like
yours
you
must
have
been
surprised
she
said
i
was
he
answered
only
think
how
strange
it
is
lina
we
who
parted
under
such
sad
and
terrible
circumstances
three
years
ago
to
meet
again
in
this
way
to
think
that
you
of
all
others
should
be
the
one
to
bring
out
the
opera
on
which
i
have
labored
so
long
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
the
author
you
must
believe
that
valchester
i
should
not
have
undertaken
it
had
i
only
known
she
exclaimed
hurriedly
and
earnestly
he
looked
at
her
the
heavy
sadness
on
his
face
deepening
as
he
saw
the
lines
of
pain
drawn
around
the
delicate
scarlet
lips
lina
were
you
so
proud
he
asked
i
did
not
know
it
was
pride
she
said
simply
i
was
only
thinking
that
that
it
were
so
much
better
if
we
had
never
met
again
she
did
not
know
what
a
pathetic
there
was
in
the
words
but
ronald
understood
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
before
she
could
prevent
him
knelt
humbly
at
her
feet
lina
you
are
quite
right
he
said
i
tried
to
keep
myself
from
coming
but
i
could
not
can
you
forgive
me
for
inflicting
this
pain
upon
you
she
did
not
answer
and
he
took
the
white
hand
that
hung
listless
by
her
side
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
i
could
not
keep
myself
from
coming
he
repeated
i
could
not
still
the
fever
and
thirst
of
my
heart
last
night
i
did
not
sleep
one
hour
the
knowledge
that
you
were
alive
and
so
near
me
almost
maddened
me
with
mingled
joy
and
pain
ah
lina
my
lost
love
you
must
forgive
me
for
coming
this
once
i
meant
to
be
brave
and
calm
i
thought
it
might
not
pain
you
as
it
did
me
i
thought
you
might
have
learned
not
to
care
the
hot
passionate
tears
he
could
not
repress
fell
on
her
white
hand
but
she
did
not
speak
one
word
there
was
nothing
she
could
say
she
had
not
learned
not
to
care
she
knew
that
her
heart
was
beating
with
a
fierce
wild
joy
because
she
had
met
him
again
but
she
knew
and
faced
the
knowledge
with
brave
uncomplaining
silence
that
when
he
passed
out
of
her
life
again
the
unhealed
wound
in
her
heart
would
only
bleed
anew
i
thought
you
might
have
forgotten
he
went
on
out
of
his
bitter
anguish
but
i
see
now
that
you
still
remember
i
remember
all
she
said
through
white
lips
it
was
such
a
happy
summer
it
would
not
be
easy
to
forget
and
it
pains
you
to
remember
it
he
said
reading
her
heart
by
the
light
of
his
own
she
did
not
answer
but
there
came
into
her
mind
those
sad
words
of
tennyson
this
is
truth
the
poet
sings
that
a
sorrow
crown
of
sorrow
is
remembering
happier
things
she
drew
her
hand
from
his
clasp
and
rose
pallid
beautiful
mournful
her
rich
and
somber
draperies
rustling
as
she
moved
away
from
him
valchester
do
not
be
angry
but
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
you
would
go
she
said
bravely
better
for
me
he
said
rising
and
looking
at
her
with
haggard
weary
eyes
for
us
both
then
she
answered
with
patient
truthfulness
though
the
color
rose
for
a
moment
to
her
cheek
not
to
see
you
again
he
said
questioningly
it
would
be
better
so
she
answered
unless
you
have
changed
your
convictions
and
he
could
not
help
seeing
the
trembling
hope
that
came
into
her
eyes
oh
ronald
have
you
never
changed
in
all
these
years
do
you
still
hold
me
bound
to
that
terrible
man
by
a
law
man
can
not
repeal
her
calmness
had
broken
down
the
anguish
of
that
wild
and
sudden
appeal
thrilled
through
his
heart
he
had
no
words
to
answer
her
he
saw
the
dark
eyes
gazing
at
him
through
a
mist
of
tears
the
white
roses
trembled
on
her
breast
with
the
quick
beating
of
her
heart
he
could
not
answer
the
question
with
a
stifled
moan
he
turned
from
the
sight
of
her
sorrowful
beauty
and
rushed
from
the
room
while
the
beautiful
singer
fell
like
a
broken
lily
to
the
floor
and
prayed
to
die
chapter
xxx
ronald
valchester
thought
after
he
had
left
the
presence
of
his
lost
love
that
day
that
he
would
not
attend
the
opera
again
at
night
but
he
had
promised
his
mother
who
had
just
arrived
in
new
york
that
morning
to
accompany
her
and
he
had
also
engaged
the
same
box
with
walter
and
violet
earle
so
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
remain
away
when
the
vast
theater
rang
with
the
wild
plaudits
that
greeted
the
queen
of
song
he
was
in
his
place
by
his
mother
side
and
his
eyes
saw
nothing
clearly
but
the
one
face
that
had
filled
his
heart
for
years
his
ears
heard
nothing
but
the
silvery
voice
that
carolled
its
songs
to
the
world
now
but
which
long
ago
it
seemed
years
and
years
measured
by
his
pain
had
sung
to
him
alone
beneath
the
blossoming
apple
boughs
while
her
heart
had
thrilled
within
him
at
the
sweetness
of
the
strain
how
like
and
how
unlike
was
the
brilliant
of
to
the
pretty
simple
girl
of
three
years
ago
the
that
had
beamed
in
those
dark
eyes
then
was
so
different
from
their
quiet
sadness
now
as
she
stood
there
in
her
costly
robes
and
gleaming
jewels
while
fragrant
flowers
rained
at
her
feet
and
the
rapturous
applause
thundered
over
her
head
her
beauty
was
peerless
yet
no
smile
curved
the
rich
red
lips
as
she
bent
her
graceful
head
though
the
lashes
swept
low
on
the
cheek
that
for
a
moment
wore
a
crimson
flush
like
the
sunset
glow
there
was
no
gladness
on
the
beautiful
face
and
yet
it
was
not
cold
or
indifferent
it
was
only
touched
on
the
fair
low
brow
in
the
dark
dark
eyes
and
on
the
arched
crimson
lips
with
the
sadness
of
thought
walter
earle
gazed
on
the
singer
too
with
his
heart
in
his
eyes
he
believed
that
madame
dolores
was
jaquelina
meredith
the
conviction
grew
upon
him
and
violet
sitting
by
her
brother
side
a
fair
and
graceful
figure
in
blue
velvet
and
pearls
on
which
many
eyes
gazed
admiringly
watched
that
slender
stately
figure
and
listened
to
the
musical
voice
with
untold
feelings
of
horror
and
despair
when
the
curtain
was
rung
down
on
the
first
act
stately
valchester
leaned
over
to
murmur
to
violet
my
love
she
said
the
reminds
me
of
some
one
i
have
seen
before
but
i
can
not
exactly
recollect
where
really
said
violet
with
an
air
of
languid
interest
but
she
fluttered
her
fan
nervously
and
did
not
try
to
enlighten
the
lady
but
walter
earle
had
heard
the
whisper
too
he
spoke
impulsively
valchester
i
will
tell
you
of
whom
she
reminds
you
she
is
like
miss
meredith
oh
yes
yes
valchester
assented
quickly
but
it
can
not
be
that
that
she
stopped
and
looked
at
walter
startled
out
of
her
usual
quiet
walter
answered
readily
the
resemblance
struck
us
all
valchester
i
for
one
believe
that
it
is
little
lina
herself
she
had
a
wonderful
voice
i
thought
thought
every
one
believed
that
she
was
dead
or
that
gerald
huntington
had
carried
her
off
again
stammered
the
lady
every
one
must
have
been
mistaken
said
walter
i
think
there
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
that
madame
dolores
is
only
the
stage
name
of
jaquelina
meredith
ronald
what
do
you
think
the
lady
asked
looking
up
half
timidly
into
the
face
of
her
son
he
had
stood
by
her
chair
pale
and
silent
as
a
statue
hearing
every
word
but
taking
no
part
in
the
conversation
he
looked
down
at
her
now
and
answered
in
a
low
quiet
voice
it
is
lina
herself
are
you
sure
cried
walter
i
am
quite
sure
ronald
answered
then
he
saw
that
they
were
all
looking
at
him
inquiringly
and
nerved
himself
to
explain
i
called
on
dolores
he
said
and
she
frankly
admitted
her
identity
he
did
not
notice
the
white
anguish
that
came
over
violet
face
he
was
startled
by
the
gladness
that
shone
in
her
brother
eyes
it
was
a
revelation
to
him
but
the
next
moment
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
fall
they
all
turned
and
saw
that
violet
had
slipped
out
of
her
chair
and
lay
on
the
floor
with
closed
eyelids
and
a
deathly
face
violet
has
fainted
cried
valchester
she
had
fainted
and
when
she
regained
consciousness
it
was
only
to
bury
her
face
on
walter
breast
and
whisper
sadly
take
me
away
he
carried
her
home
and
when
they
were
gone
valchester
looked
at
her
son
ronald
do
you
know
what
violet
fainting
meant
she
asked
gravely
it
was
too
warm
i
think
said
the
unconscious
poet
oh
how
blind
you
are
ronald
exclaimed
his
mother
chapter
xxxi
the
next
day
while
madam
dolores
sat
alone
in
her
beautiful
parlor
a
card
was
brought
to
her
she
read
upon
it
the
name
of
walter
earle
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
once
more
he
said
as
she
rose
to
receive
him
valchester
told
me
he
had
called
upon
you
yesterday
and
i
could
not
resist
coming
the
sensitive
color
walter
remembered
so
well
rose
into
clear
cheek
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
earle
she
replied
and
gave
him
her
hand
in
a
perfectly
frank
unembarrassed
way
walter
pressed
it
a
moment
with
a
quickened
and
then
they
sat
down
he
congratulated
her
on
her
brilliant
career
you
must
tell
me
how
it
all
came
about
he
said
we
all
believed
you
dead
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
must
have
opened
and
swallowed
you
that
morning
when
i
left
you
at
the
park
gates
i
wish
it
had
she
cried
involuntarily
and
a
look
of
pain
came
over
the
eager
handsome
face
of
the
listener
were
you
so
unhappy
lina
he
asked
sadly
the
white
hands
clasped
each
other
tightly
and
tears
came
into
the
sad
dark
eyes
as
she
lifted
them
to
walter
face
i
was
wretched
she
replied
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
heart
was
broken
but
you
were
not
so
desperate
as
i
feared
he
said
for
when
you
disappeared
so
strangely
and
we
could
hear
nothing
of
your
fate
i
was
always
afraid
that
you
had
drowned
yourself
i
was
not
quite
so
reckless
nor
so
romantic
said
jaquelina
with
a
slight
air
of
surprise
i
was
very
anxious
to
get
away
from
myself
but
as
that
was
impossible
i
did
the
next
best
thing
that
occurred
to
me
i
simply
ran
away
from
the
scenes
and
associations
which
it
was
beyond
my
strength
to
endure
any
longer
you
must
have
taken
infinite
pains
to
hide
every
trace
of
your
flight
he
said
no
one
saw
or
heard
anything
of
you
after
i
parted
from
you
that
is
not
so
strange
when
you
remember
how
early
it
was
and
what
a
wet
and
chilly
morning
replied
jaquelina
quietly
i
am
almost
sure
i
did
not
meet
a
single
person
on
the
road
but
i
went
straight
home
my
uncle
and
aunt
were
very
early
risers
you
know
they
were
both
out
of
the
house
uncle
in
the
field
and
his
wife
at
the
milking
i
supposed
i
went
to
my
room
donned
a
traveling
suit
and
taking
a
small
bag
in
my
hand
left
the
house
unobserved
i
walked
to
the
station
and
took
an
early
train
for
staunton
you
had
friends
there
said
walter
deeply
interested
in
her
quiet
story
only
professor
larue
my
old
and
his
wife
she
replied
i
went
to
them
quite
sure
of
a
welcome
they
had
always
predicted
great
things
of
me
she
added
with
the
deep
color
rushing
to
her
cheeks
you
have
been
with
them
always
then
he
asked
always
she
replied
they
have
supplied
the
place
of
the
parents
i
never
knew
i
owe
them
everything
god
bless
them
said
walter
fervently
i
shall
always
love
them
because
they
were
kind
to
you
in
your
sorrow
lina
he
could
not
help
calling
her
lina
he
did
not
like
the
sound
of
her
stage
name
and
miss
meredith
seemed
so
cold
and
formal
in
this
moment
when
they
had
been
parted
so
long
she
did
not
seem
to
care
she
looked
at
him
now
and
answered
quietly
yes
they
were
very
kind
yet
they
never
knew
how
much
i
needed
love
and
kindness
they
had
only
themselves
to
care
for
the
professor
had
always
been
wild
over
my
voice
i
was
reckless
desperate
i
allowed
him
to
have
his
own
way
with
me
he
took
me
to
europe
procured
musical
instructors
for
me
and
in
time
i
made
my
in
opera
and
from
thenceforward
it
has
been
vidi
smiled
walter
yes
she
replied
with
the
calmness
of
indifference
i
have
been
what
the
world
calls
very
fortunate
i
have
won
fame
and
gold
i
have
been
loved
and
sought
i
have
had
all
the
best
the
world
has
to
give
except
here
her
low
voice
sank
still
lower
except
happiness
poor
child
he
said
involuntarily
except
happiness
she
repeated
looking
at
him
with
her
large
soft
mournful
eyes
that
was
impossible
you
know
an
answering
sadness
came
into
walter
blue
eyes
is
happiness
always
to
be
an
impossibility
to
you
lina
he
asked
always
she
answered
with
patient
resignation
lina
have
you
ever
seen
gerald
huntington
since
that
night
he
broke
out
never
she
replied
with
a
shudder
and
her
pale
face
grew
paler
still
and
you
have
never
guessed
why
he
repudiated
you
in
the
very
moment
he
made
you
his
bride
never
she
answered
again
there
was
some
secret
connected
with
it
something
he
found
out
when
he
saw
the
picture
of
my
mother
i
can
not
tell
what
it
was
i
have
no
idea
i
saw
gerald
huntington
at
the
opera
last
night
he
said
startlingly
jaquelina
sprang
to
her
feet
and
looked
at
him
in
a
very
panic
of
terror
you
saw
she
said
her
breath
coming
and
going
in
fluttering
gasps
oh
mr
earle
she
cried
out
in
wild
hope
and
anxiety
did
uncle
charlie
ever
try
to
get
me
freed
from
him
if
indeed
i
was
ever
bound
for
it
seemed
to
me
a
mere
farce
nothing
more
he
did
not
try
lina
you
were
gone
and
it
seemed
as
if
you
were
dead
walter
said
hesitatingly
he
did
not
try
and
gerald
huntington
is
here
oh
earle
do
you
think
he
has
recognized
me
why
is
he
here
what
does
he
mean
to
do
oh
if
i
had
never
returned
here
jaquelina
cried
rapidly
and
excitedly
before
walter
could
reply
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
violet
earle
came
quickly
into
the
room
walter
you
she
cried
chapter
xxxii
walter
earle
looked
at
his
sister
in
surprise
he
had
left
her
rather
unwell
and
complaining
of
a
headache
even
now
her
eyes
were
dull
and
heavy
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
a
feverish
crimson
violet
i
would
have
waited
for
you
if
i
had
known
you
would
come
he
said
i
preferred
to
come
alone
she
replied
a
little
shortly
then
she
went
to
jaquelina
and
held
out
her
hands
how
do
you
do
lina
she
said
you
must
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
on
your
brilliant
success
the
words
were
calm
and
conventional
there
was
no
heart
in
them
jaquelina
felt
it
vaguely
but
she
laid
her
hands
in
violet
kindly
and
would
have
kissed
her
only
miss
earle
did
not
offer
her
lips
then
violet
looked
around
at
her
brother
with
a
charming
smile
i
came
alone
that
i
might
have
a
quiet
chat
with
our
old
friend
she
said
and
i
dare
say
you
have
finished
your
call
so
you
may
just
take
yourself
off
walter
walter
looked
uneasy
but
her
careless
gaiety
disarmed
his
vague
dread
he
went
up
to
jaquelina
and
held
out
his
hand
i
must
give
way
to
violet
this
time
he
said
but
i
will
call
again
and
continue
our
interrupted
conversation
if
you
will
permit
me
jaquelina
turned
courteously
to
her
guest
who
had
thrown
herself
wearily
into
a
cushioned
chair
i
hope
your
mamma
is
well
miss
earle
she
said
gently
thinking
of
the
faded
little
lady
who
had
always
been
so
kind
violet
looked
surprised
and
pained
did
not
walter
tell
you
she
cried
oh
lina
mamma
is
dead
dead
cried
jaquelina
and
the
quick
tears
sprang
into
her
eyes
i
am
sorry
no
one
had
told
me
of
it
how
long
is
it
violet
almost
three
years
now
answered
violet
sadly
she
died
the
winter
you
went
away
i
i
do
not
like
to
recall
it
i
was
away
at
the
time
visiting
the
valchesters
in
richmond
it
was
very
very
sudden
she
had
disease
of
the
heart
i
am
so
sorry
jaquelina
repeated
sorrowfully
i
loved
her
dearly
she
was
always
kind
to
me
yes
mamma
loved
you
dearly
said
violet
gravely
yet
you
disappointed
her
dearest
hope
lina
her
dearest
hope
cried
jaquelina
i
do
not
understand
you
violet
she
wished
above
everything
for
you
to
have
become
walter
wife
exclaimed
violet
the
beautiful
singer
colored
deeply
but
she
did
not
reply
we
all
wished
it
continued
violet
it
would
have
pleased
me
very
much
i
can
not
tell
you
what
a
disappointment
it
was
to
us
all
when
you
chose
valchester
a
disappointment
and
a
surprise
as
well
the
match
seemed
so
unsuitable
jaquelina
lifted
her
dark
eyes
and
regarded
her
gravely
why
unsuitable
she
asked
oh
i
could
hardly
explain
it
answered
violet
vaguely
but
it
struck
us
all
that
way
ronald
valchester
was
so
very
peculiar
you
must
have
thought
so
yourself
after
you
learned
his
strange
views
of
marriage
and
divorce
did
you
not
dear
jaquelina
sat
silent
her
hands
tightly
clasped
in
her
lap
ronald
is
so
very
very
proud
went
on
violet
after
a
moment
he
was
too
proud
to
marry
a
woman
who
had
been
married
to
gerald
huntington
so
he
invented
that
excuse
to
break
with
you
miss
earle
i
believe
your
views
do
injustice
to
valchester
jaquelina
answered
with
grave
sad
dignity
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
his
views
are
peculiar
but
i
am
quite
quite
sure
that
he
only
acted
in
accordance
with
his
honest
convictions
of
duty
an
irrepressible
sneer
of
scorn
rose
to
violet
lips
you
must
remember
i
have
known
ronald
valchester
longer
than
you
have
she
said
you
have
known
him
longer
but
i
can
not
think
you
understand
him
any
better
than
i
do
jaquelina
answered
with
gentle
sadness
violet
bit
her
lip
at
the
quiet
rejoinder
but
still
she
persevered
let
me
give
you
another
instance
of
his
peculiarity
she
said
are
you
aware
that
he
entertains
a
most
unwarrantable
and
ridiculous
prejudice
against
a
public
life
for
a
woman
such
a
life
as
you
lead
for
instance
will
you
discredit
this
assertion
also
lina
no
for
i
have
long
been
aware
of
the
fact
she
replied
with
perfect
calmness
ah
then
he
was
frank
enough
to
tell
you
so
yesterday
cried
violet
with
unmistakable
triumph
and
delight
oh
no
i
knew
his
opinion
years
and
years
ago
the
singer
replied
simply
and
you
actually
defied
his
opinion
you
were
careless
of
what
he
would
wish
exclaimed
violet
earle
surprised
and
incredulous
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
white
hands
that
were
clasped
together
in
her
lap
were
lifted
to
hide
her
face
then
she
dropped
them
again
and
answered
with
quivering
lips
no
miss
earle
do
not
say
that
i
was
never
either
careless
or
defiant
of
ronald
valchester
opinion
i
loved
him
too
well
always
always
to
do
him
that
despite
but
the
old
life
was
unendurable
it
was
madness
to
remember
all
i
had
lost
i
threw
myself
feverishly
into
a
public
career
because
it
promised
forgetfulness
and
have
you
found
it
violet
asked
her
quickly
no
the
simple
word
dropped
mournfully
from
the
quivering
lips
violet
looked
searchingly
at
the
sad
young
face
that
looked
so
with
the
dark
fringes
of
the
long
curling
lashes
resting
against
the
cheeks
a
mental
vision
of
that
face
three
years
ago
came
over
her
she
remembered
it
happy
she
remembered
the
faded
print
dress
the
shabby
boots
the
worn
poetry
volume
in
the
place
of
that
simple
girl
here
was
a
beautiful
woman
clothed
with
purple
and
fine
linen
a
woman
who
but
a
little
while
ago
had
told
walter
earle
that
life
had
given
her
fame
wealth
admiration
everything
except
happiness
violet
studied
the
beautiful
face
curiously
a
moment
then
inquired
abruptly
lina
did
you
know
when
you
came
here
that
ronald
valchester
was
the
author
of
the
opera
you
have
brought
out
with
such
signal
success
no
i
did
not
know
it
until
yesterday
she
replied
not
until
ronald
called
upon
you
inquired
violet
not
until
then
was
the
answer
then
violet
said
with
flushing
cheeks
and
restless
eyes
tell
me
lina
if
you
had
known
it
would
you
have
come
no
i
would
not
have
come
jaquelina
replied
firmly
but
since
you
come
said
violet
with
a
look
of
relief
what
do
you
intend
to
do
about
it
the
singer
looked
up
with
a
surprised
face
violet
looked
down
uneasily
before
that
wondering
gaze
miss
earle
what
is
there
that
i
do
she
inquired
in
a
clear
distinct
voice
you
could
go
away
violet
replied
i
intend
to
do
so
the
very
day
that
my
engagement
is
ended
jaquelina
answered
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
so
before
i
am
under
the
heaviest
bonds
to
the
manager
to
fulfill
my
contract
to
evade
it
i
should
have
to
forfeit
the
greater
part
of
my
fortune
you
would
be
willing
to
do
that
to
insure
happiness
would
you
not
asked
violet
quickly
i
would
do
more
than
that
to
secure
ronald
happiness
jaquelina
answered
i
would
give
my
life
do
you
love
him
so
well
then
violet
asked
with
actual
pain
upon
her
face
yes
was
the
quiet
reply
i
love
him
well
enough
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
him
if
it
could
but
secure
his
happiness
can
you
tell
me
how
to
do
so
miss
earle
yes
said
violet
obtain
a
divorce
from
gerald
huntington
and
marry
walter
marry
walter
jaquelina
echoed
faintly
what
happiness
could
that
give
to
ronald
it
would
leave
him
free
to
marry
elsewhere
now
he
has
a
foolish
quixotic
notion
that
honor
binds
him
to
remain
single
for
your
sake
and
he
would
be
glad
to
be
free
from
that
shadowy
tie
asked
the
with
white
lips
yes
violet
answered
recklessly
whom
would
he
marry
asked
jaquelina
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
dark
eyes
and
the
blue
ones
looked
straight
into
each
other
in
the
first
moments
of
that
interview
jaquelina
had
read
the
secret
of
the
other
she
was
not
surprised
when
violet
answered
desperately
i
would
try
to
win
him
for
myself
then
you
love
him
said
jaquelina
in
a
tone
of
the
gentlest
pity
violet
lay
back
in
the
great
velvet
her
face
as
pale
as
death
her
white
hand
pressed
to
her
side
to
still
its
heavy
beatings
she
answered
gaspingly
yes
i
love
him
i
have
always
loved
him
before
you
ever
saw
him
if
i
do
not
win
him
i
shall
die
then
the
white
lids
closed
and
she
lay
unconscious
before
the
eyes
of
her
dreaded
rival
jaquelina
bent
over
her
and
chafed
the
nerveless
hands
in
her
own
with
tenderest
pity
poor
violet
she
murmured
i
never
dreamed
of
this
yet
i
have
been
her
unconscious
rival
for
years
must
i
give
him
up
to
her
alas
he
is
not
mine
to
give
it
was
several
minutes
before
violet
revived
she
looked
up
into
the
face
of
her
rival
and
whispered
fearfully
it
is
my
heart
lina
i
can
not
bear
any
great
excitement
i
have
inherited
my
mother
disease
the
look
of
grief
and
pity
that
came
over
jaquelina
sensitive
features
disarmed
all
violet
passionate
jealousy
and
resentment
for
a
moment
a
blush
of
shame
colored
her
pale
cheeks
and
she
cried
out
with
a
sudden
remorseful
impulse
oh
lina
do
not
look
at
me
so
kindly
you
would
not
if
you
knew
touched
by
an
impulse
of
pity
jaquelina
bent
and
kissed
the
white
brow
with
its
soft
waves
of
golden
hair
i
know
what
you
mean
dear
she
said
you
have
been
angry
with
me
because
ronald
loved
me
you
could
not
help
it
dear
i
am
sorry
but
i
am
not
angry
you
can
not
be
very
envious
of
me
his
love
has
not
brought
me
much
happiness
it
was
an
anguished
plaint
from
the
young
heart
that
had
suffered
for
years
in
brave
silence
violet
looked
at
her
in
wonder
oh
lina
she
cried
how
have
you
borne
your
sorrow
all
these
years
violet
i
could
not
tell
you
she
answered
sometimes
i
wonder
at
myself
when
i
look
back
through
the
long
years
and
remember
how
hard
it
was
to
bear
i
think
it
was
only
my
art
that
kept
my
heart
from
breaking
ah
i
have
had
nothing
to
divert
my
mind
cried
violet
i
have
spent
my
whole
time
thinking
of
ronald
valchester
yes
and
trying
to
win
him
you
need
not
look
so
pained
lina
i
loved
him
before
you
ever
saw
him
and
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
the
prior
right
to
him
she
paused
then
as
jaquelina
made
no
reply
she
went
on
slowly
after
you
were
lost
to
him
so
strangely
i
set
my
whole
heart
on
winning
him
i
think
nay
i
am
almost
sure
that
i
must
have
succeeded
in
time
if
only
ah
if
only
you
had
not
come
back
lina
lina
clasped
her
white
hands
tightly
as
she
looked
at
the
speaker
what
difference
could
that
make
she
asked
you
know
it
is
impossible
i
should
win
him
violet
by
his
own
will
we
are
separated
forever
yes
i
know
that
said
violet
but
you
see
lina
you
have
turned
his
thoughts
into
the
past
the
words
were
spoken
with
almost
a
sob
as
the
singer
made
no
reply
she
continued
fretfully
and
almost
reproachfully
you
have
ruined
everything
by
coming
back
lina
you
have
spoiled
ronald
peace
and
made
walter
heart
ache
and
you
have
destroyed
my
only
hope
of
happiness
i
know
i
shall
surely
die
chapter
xxxiii
those
who
attended
the
opera
that
night
thought
that
madam
dolores
sang
more
exquisitely
than
ever
before
she
poured
her
whole
heart
into
the
passionate
strains
of
the
music
she
held
every
heart
chained
by
the
power
of
her
beauty
and
genius
the
impressible
throng
was
swayed
tumultuously
men
hearts
beat
fast
with
love
for
her
beauty
and
admiration
for
her
genius
yet
although
their
hearts
lay
at
her
feet
no
one
dreamed
that
it
was
possible
to
win
her
there
was
a
look
on
the
fair
face
beneath
the
diamond
tiara
that
bound
the
dark
hair
that
forbade
the
thought
there
was
a
story
written
on
that
face
a
story
of
poetry
and
passion
and
sorrow
the
dark
eyes
did
not
dwell
on
men
faces
they
looked
down
as
if
in
mournful
retrospection
the
scarlet
lips
but
seldom
smiled
the
cheeks
were
always
pale
one
pair
of
eyes
followed
every
movement
of
the
with
a
passionate
pain
and
repressed
yearning
in
their
grave
sad
depths
she
did
not
turn
to
meet
their
glances
yet
she
knew
instinctively
that
he
was
there
through
all
the
scenes
in
which
she
took
her
brilliant
part
there
remained
with
her
an
aching
consciousness
of
that
note
which
ronald
valchester
held
tightly
clenched
in
his
hand
as
he
followed
her
every
movement
with
hungry
despairing
eyes
the
note
she
had
sent
him
that
evening
at
twilight
it
was
brief
and
calm
but
ronald
had
read
it
over
and
over
he
had
held
the
thick
satiny
sheet
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
the
delicate
flowing
chirography
with
a
blank
staring
gaze
trying
to
picture
to
himself
the
white
jeweled
hand
that
had
traced
those
lines
that
seemed
so
cold
and
cruel
to
his
eager
passionate
though
wretched
heart
yet
jaquelina
had
not
meant
to
be
so
cruel
she
had
only
written
out
of
the
tenderness
of
her
pity
for
violet
and
the
sadness
of
her
own
despair
these
plaintive
words
dear
ronald
for
the
sake
of
all
that
i
might
have
been
to
you
once
i
beg
you
to
listen
to
me
and
grant
my
prayer
i
have
learned
that
you
are
deeply
beloved
by
one
whose
unconscious
rival
i
have
been
for
years
perhaps
you
may
guess
her
name
it
is
violet
earle
it
will
make
her
very
happy
if
you
will
make
her
your
wife
one
more
request
ronald
i
am
compelled
to
remain
in
new
york
two
weeks
longer
i
think
i
could
bear
it
better
ronald
if
you
would
leave
new
york
and
return
to
the
south
until
i
am
gone
you
understand
the
earles
return
go
with
them
ronald
marry
violet
and
try
to
be
happy
for
me
i
will
leave
america
as
soon
as
my
engagement
is
ended
and
henceforth
the
whole
width
of
the
world
shall
remain
between
us
that
was
what
lina
had
written
to
the
lover
from
whom
she
had
been
so
tragically
parted
before
the
very
altar
the
poet
lover
of
whom
she
had
been
so
proud
and
fond
he
read
and
the
note
with
dazed
eyes
full
of
grief
and
pain
there
was
another
man
in
that
vast
theater
too
who
clenched
a
folded
note
in
his
strong
white
hand
while
he
gazed
at
the
beautiful
singer
with
burning
black
eyes
and
eager
repressed
passion
in
every
line
of
his
haughty
superbly
handsome
face
he
had
no
eyes
for
anyone
else
but
madam
dolores
save
that
now
and
then
his
gaze
strayed
to
the
box
where
ronald
valchester
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
curtains
and
a
gleam
of
satanic
rage
and
hatred
transfigured
the
dusky
beauty
of
his
proud
face
once
or
twice
he
opened
the
note
he
held
and
read
it
over
with
a
grim
and
deadly
smile
upon
his
lips
it
was
a
challenge
to
a
duel
and
as
gerald
huntington
sat
there
feasting
his
eyes
on
the
beauty
of
the
and
filling
his
heart
with
the
magic
sweetness
of
her
voice
he
knew
that
it
was
quite
probable
that
this
was
the
last
time
he
might
ever
behold
her
charming
face
the
play
was
over
at
last
the
storm
of
bouquets
had
rained
upon
the
stage
at
the
feet
of
madame
dolores
the
curtain
had
fallen
the
lights
were
dim
she
had
passed
to
her
carriage
with
downcast
eyes
that
did
not
see
the
two
men
who
waited
outside
the
door
taking
no
note
of
each
other
presence
in
their
eager
desire
that
one
glance
from
those
dark
eyes
might
fall
upon
them
but
they
lingered
in
vain
the
long
lashes
did
not
lift
from
the
white
cheeks
the
closing
door
shut
her
in
from
their
sight
the
two
men
who
loved
her
each
in
his
own
fashion
left
the
scene
disappointed
and
sad
while
jaquelina
rode
home
to
spend
the
long
hours
of
the
night
in
a
weary
sleepless
vigil
she
was
wondering
over
and
over
in
a
weary
dazed
way
if
ronald
valchester
would
take
her
at
her
word
and
marry
violet
if
he
marries
her
poor
violet
she
said
to
herself
sadly
and
tearfully
i
wish
to
be
quite
out
of
the
country
before
it
takes
place
then
it
came
to
her
mind
that
perhaps
she
was
selfish
in
the
wish
not
that
i
wish
it
not
to
be
she
said
i
pity
poor
violet
and
i
pity
ronald
he
will
learn
to
love
her
in
time
she
is
fair
and
sweet
they
may
be
happy
yet
she
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
in
her
long
white
her
dark
hair
trailing
loosely
over
her
shoulders
a
pathetic
despair
in
the
dark
eyes
and
in
the
droop
of
the
red
lips
they
may
be
happy
she
repeated
happy
while
i
oh
god
with
a
sudden
gesture
of
wild
despair
oh
god
how
much
longer
must
i
live
to
bear
my
burden
of
sorrow
she
fell
upon
the
floor
and
lay
there
moaning
and
weeping
for
long
hours
it
was
not
often
that
tears
came
to
those
dark
eyes
but
the
sealed
fountains
of
sorrow
were
unclosed
and
the
quick
refreshing
came
quick
and
fast
they
relieved
her
they
seemed
to
cool
the
fever
of
her
blood
and
lift
the
burden
that
weighed
so
heavily
on
her
heart
no
sleep
came
to
the
dark
eyes
that
night
when
her
maid
came
to
call
her
the
next
morning
she
found
her
sitting
wearily
in
a
great
cushioned
her
dark
hair
flowing
about
her
in
waving
masses
her
dark
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
with
a
grief
more
pathetic
than
tears
in
their
shadowy
depths
oh
my
dear
lady
you
have
not
been
in
bed
all
night
she
cried
in
dismay
jaquelina
looked
at
her
in
kind
of
vacant
surprise
why
fanchette
is
it
morning
she
asked
looking
around
at
the
drawn
curtains
and
the
flaring
oh
yes
madam
and
here
a
note
which
has
just
come
for
you
so
i
thought
i
had
better
bring
it
in
and
not
wait
for
your
bell
to
ring
as
it
is
getting
late
jaquelina
took
the
delicately
scented
note
and
opened
it
almost
mechanically
it
was
an
incoherent
scrawl
from
violet
earle
oh
lina
lina
it
ran
i
told
you
you
had
ruined
all
our
lives
by
coming
back
that
terrible
gerald
huntington
has
murdered
our
poor
walter
this
morning
he
has
spoken
but
once
and
then
only
to
ask
for
you
come
at
once
chapter
xxxiv
the
earles
were
not
staying
at
a
hotel
they
were
at
the
residence
of
a
distant
relative
in
a
fashionable
quarter
of
the
city
violet
had
inclosed
her
address
and
the
drove
there
immediately
full
of
grief
and
horror
over
walter
dreadful
fate
violet
met
her
in
the
elegant
the
beautiful
blonde
looking
pale
wan
and
distracted
in
the
dim
morning
light
her
blue
morning
robe
was
all
in
disorder
her
golden
hair
was
disarranged
there
were
dark
circles
beneath
her
eyes
and
the
soft
blue
orbs
were
drowned
in
tears
oh
lina
lina
i
told
you
so
she
cried
breaking
into
wild
hysterical
weeping
you
have
made
us
all
wretched
you
have
caused
poor
walter
death
oh
my
brother
my
brother
jaquelina
stood
irresolute
in
the
center
of
the
room
her
lips
quivering
at
violet
passionate
charge
oh
violet
do
she
cried
lifting
her
white
hands
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow
i
have
done
nothing
i
love
you
all
i
would
give
my
life
to
make
you
and
ronald
and
walter
happy
tell
me
of
walter
he
is
not
dead
he
will
not
die
oh
violet
do
not
tell
me
so
i
could
not
bear
it
there
has
been
a
duel
violet
cried
they
met
outside
of
the
city
this
morning
and
fought
that
dreadful
man
your
husband
shot
walter
and
got
away
himself
we
did
not
know
one
thing
lina
till
they
brought
our
poor
boy
home
dead
jaquelina
asked
with
pitiful
anguish
in
face
and
voice
not
dead
but
dying
we
fear
wept
violet
wildly
the
beautiful
singer
knelt
by
the
side
of
the
agitated
girl
who
had
thrown
herself
down
on
a
silken
couch
sobbing
and
weeping
in
utter
hysterical
abandonment
she
put
her
arms
around
her
and
drew
the
golden
head
to
a
upon
her
breast
oh
violet
she
murmured
smoothing
back
the
disheveled
tresses
with
gentle
fingers
do
not
give
way
so
utterly
try
to
be
calm
it
may
not
be
so
bad
as
you
think
i
can
not
believe
that
walter
will
die
he
is
young
and
strong
let
us
pray
that
god
will
spare
his
life
there
was
some
moments
of
utter
silence
violet
grief
had
spent
itself
for
awhile
she
lay
passive
on
jaquelina
tender
breast
her
golden
eyelids
resting
on
her
pallid
cheeks
the
delicate
lips
of
the
moved
silently
for
a
little
while
as
if
in
prayer
perhaps
for
the
wounded
man
who
lay
up
stairs
breathing
painfully
and
shortly
then
she
spoke
violet
you
will
tell
me
how
it
all
came
about
why
did
they
fight
it
was
for
your
sake
lina
violet
replied
moving
uneasily
from
the
clasp
of
her
arm
and
opening
her
eyes
a
moment
for
my
sake
lina
cried
with
white
lips
oh
violet
i
do
not
understand
read
this
and
violet
put
a
note
into
her
hand
walter
left
it
on
his
this
morning
for
me
i
found
it
a
little
while
ago
walter
had
written
as
follows
dear
sister
i
have
challenged
gerald
huntington
and
am
gone
to
fight
him
this
morning
i
saw
him
at
the
opera
night
before
last
and
yesterday
i
sent
him
a
challenge
i
have
taken
ronald
quarrel
on
myself
it
would
not
have
been
right
for
ronald
to
fight
him
because
if
he
had
killed
lina
husband
it
would
have
been
wrong
for
him
to
marry
lina
so
without
ronald
knowledge
i
have
taken
up
ronald
quarrel
i
hope
i
shall
kill
the
villain
and
then
lina
will
be
free
to
marry
valchester
i
love
lina
so
dearly
i
can
not
bear
to
see
her
unhappy
if
i
kill
huntington
i
shall
fly
to
a
foreign
land
if
he
kills
me
i
shall
have
done
all
i
could
to
help
my
darling
to
happiness
in
either
case
violet
you
must
tell
her
that
i
did
it
for
her
sake
lina
tears
fell
quick
and
fast
on
those
brave
pathetic
words
oh
poor
poor
walter
she
exclaimed
and
he
has
asked
for
me
violet
yes
violet
replied
will
you
go
to
him
now
lina
yes
with
a
slight
shudder
of
dread
at
what
she
was
about
to
see
violet
led
her
up
a
stairway
into
a
darkened
luxurious
chamber
where
the
wounded
man
lay
among
the
snowy
pillows
watched
by
a
skillful
surgeon
and
careful
nurses
jaquelina
went
up
to
the
bed
she
did
not
see
ronald
valchester
draw
back
quickly
into
the
shadow
of
the
in
fear
that
it
might
pain
her
to
see
him
there
walter
lay
white
and
still
upon
the
bed
his
fair
curling
locks
brushed
back
the
long
lashes
lying
on
his
pale
cheeks
like
one
asleep
but
at
the
soft
swish
of
jaquelina
silken
robe
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
oh
walter
i
am
so
sorry
she
cried
oh
why
why
did
you
do
it
lina
it
was
for
your
sake
he
replied
you
should
not
have
done
it
it
was
all
wrong
she
cried
out
quickly
lina
do
not
blame
me
he
said
weakly
i
could
not
help
it
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
dear
jaquelina
pressed
the
hand
she
held
impulsively
to
her
lips
i
remembered
what
you
said
walter
continued
in
feeble
accents
that
life
had
given
you
all
save
happiness
and
i
would
so
gladly
have
given
you
that
too
lina
oh
walter
you
have
a
noble
heart
she
cried
and
a
faint
smile
curved
his
lips
but
i
have
failed
he
said
so
sadly
i
have
utterly
failed
and
the
only
pleasant
thought
i
have
in
dying
is
that
i
have
given
my
life
in
the
attempt
to
make
you
and
ronald
happy
you
will
not
die
walter
you
must
not
she
cried
i
should
feel
as
if
i
had
murdered
you
you
must
try
to
get
well
again
walter
shook
his
head
in
silence
and
lina
looked
around
at
the
surgeon
oh
sir
he
will
get
well
will
he
not
she
exclaimed
pleadingly
i
hope
so
he
answered
gravely
but
her
quick
ear
detected
the
tone
of
doubt
in
his
voice
she
looked
down
at
the
handsome
white
face
on
the
pillow
he
was
so
young
and
life
held
so
much
for
him
yet
he
was
dying
dying
for
her
walter
you
must
not
go
away
from
us
like
this
live
walter
dim
eyes
flashed
wide
open
full
of
eager
joy
lina
he
exclaimed
incredulously
i
mean
it
she
whispered
gently
try
to
live
walter
and
as
soon
as
i
can
be
relieved
of
those
galling
fetters
that
bind
me
i
will
be
your
own
i
will
be
as
generous
as
you
are
you
were
willing
to
give
me
your
life
now
i
will
give
you
mine
lina
i
must
not
accept
such
a
sacrifice
from
you
he
whispered
almost
too
weak
to
refuse
the
promise
she
gave
so
unselfishly
but
lina
murmured
with
a
sad
pretty
attempt
at
archness
you
must
not
refuse
a
lady
hand
when
she
offers
it
to
you
herself
mr
earle
walter
face
was
radiant
with
joy
and
hope
as
he
pressed
her
hand
and
whispered
if
i
accept
it
lina
it
is
not
through
selfishness
but
because
if
i
live
i
believe
that
my
great
love
can
not
fail
in
time
to
make
you
happy
may
god
spare
your
life
walter
she
whispered
from
the
depths
of
her
grateful
generous
heart
then
as
she
turned
her
head
aside
quickly
to
hide
the
pain
that
came
into
her
face
at
the
thought
of
that
other
dearer
love
that
might
have
made
her
life
so
fair
she
suddenly
encountered
ronald
eyes
looking
straight
into
her
own
there
was
in
that
straining
gaze
a
look
of
dumb
and
hopeless
agony
that
jaquelina
never
forgot
to
her
dying
day
the
beautiful
eyes
that
expressed
as
eyes
of
another
color
never
can
the
lights
and
shades
of
feeling
were
fixed
on
hers
with
a
yearning
pathos
that
went
straight
to
her
heart
then
ronald
turned
quickly
and
went
from
the
room
it
was
all
in
a
moment
walter
had
taken
no
notice
with
his
glad
eyes
fixed
on
jaquelina
face
he
was
praying
silently
that
his
life
might
be
spared
to
him
when
jaquelina
was
leaving
almost
an
hour
later
she
found
ronald
valchester
waiting
on
the
pavement
to
hand
her
to
her
carriage
when
she
was
seated
he
held
her
hand
a
moment
in
his
own
and
bent
forward
to
speak
to
her
lina
he
said
hurriedly
i
meant
to
go
south
as
you
wish
me
but
that
will
be
impossible
now
i
can
not
desert
walter
he
is
my
dearest
friend
and
when
i
was
wounded
three
years
ago
he
nursed
me
like
a
brother
can
you
endure
my
presence
a
little
longer
i
bear
it
as
i
have
done
many
things
she
said
with
her
white
hand
on
her
heart
you
must
not
forsake
your
friend
then
she
lifted
her
haunting
dark
eyes
to
his
face
ronald
you
are
not
angry
with
me
she
said
wistfully
walter
has
loved
me
through
long
years
and
i
could
never
be
yours
you
know
he
shook
his
head
with
white
lips
and
violet
she
said
to
him
questioningly
i
spoke
to
her
a
little
while
ago
he
said
it
was
only
because
wished
it
lina
she
will
be
my
wife
he
felt
rather
than
saw
the
shiver
that
ran
over
the
slender
form
of
the
when
i
marry
her
he
added
after
a
moment
i
shall
take
her
far
away
lina
i
think
it
best
as
you
said
to
put
the
whole
width
of
the
world
between
you
and
me
forever
she
bowed
speechlessly
the
black
now
with
a
yearning
love
and
fathomless
despair
looked
into
hers
gloomily
a
moment
then
the
clanged
heavily
between
them
the
echoed
low
on
the
sand
and
loud
on
the
stone
chapter
xxxv
ronald
there
is
something
i
should
like
to
tell
you
walter
earle
said
to
his
friend
with
a
hesitating
air
when
they
found
themselves
alone
a
little
while
that
evening
ronald
valchester
looked
at
the
handsome
face
lying
on
the
pillow
despite
its
pallor
it
wore
a
look
of
triumphant
happiness
walter
you
need
not
tell
me
he
said
with
outward
calmness
i
have
heard
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
thank
you
walter
replied
then
he
looked
at
the
calm
inscrutable
face
ronald
i
hope
you
do
not
blame
me
the
wounded
man
went
on
anxiously
i
have
always
loved
her
but
i
would
not
have
taken
her
from
you
only
you
know
you
never
could
have
married
her
with
your
views
of
divorce
but
as
i
think
differently
from
you
i
can
not
believe
i
am
wrong
to
marry
her
when
i
am
better
and
she
is
free
i
do
not
blame
you
in
the
least
answered
ronald
valchester
if
i
had
known
all
the
time
how
well
you
loved
her
walter
i
must
have
marveled
at
your
persistent
efforts
to
convert
me
to
your
own
belief
that
a
legal
divorce
makes
men
and
women
free
to
marry
again
if
i
could
convert
you
even
now
said
walter
earnestly
i
would
resign
her
to
you
the
very
moment
in
which
she
is
free
you
can
not
convert
me
walter
ronald
answered
with
a
sad
smile
god
only
knows
what
i
have
suffered
through
this
belief
of
mine
but
i
can
not
change
it
nor
act
inconsistently
with
it
yet
i
could
not
ask
lina
to
remain
alone
all
her
life
because
my
own
views
are
at
variance
with
the
rest
of
the
world
or
a
majority
of
it
at
least
i
hope
that
you
may
make
her
very
happy
i
shall
try
certainly
walter
said
earnestly
if
i
recover
and
i
feel
as
if
i
can
not
die
now
with
this
prospect
of
happiness
in
the
future
i
shall
marry
lina
as
soon
as
professor
larue
has
secured
a
divorce
for
her
i
shall
take
her
back
to
laurel
hill
and
spend
my
life
in
trying
to
win
her
heart
and
make
her
happy
and
i
said
ronald
with
brave
composure
shall
marry
violet
as
soon
as
you
are
well
enough
to
go
to
church
with
us
then
we
shall
make
our
home
across
the
sea
in
sunny
italy
walter
earle
rose
feebly
on
his
elbow
and
stared
at
his
friend
marry
violet
marry
violet
he
cried
incredulously
yes
i
asked
her
and
she
said
she
would
be
my
wife
you
do
not
love
her
walter
exclaimed
bewildered
not
yet
the
poet
confessed
flushing
slightly
at
walter
surprised
gaze
why
marry
her
then
lina
wished
me
to
do
so
ronald
replied
with
gentle
frankness
lina
wished
it
i
do
not
understand
explain
yourself
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
a
moment
then
ronald
answered
gravely
and
gently
i
will
tell
you
walter
lina
had
found
out
a
fact
which
i
foolish
dreamer
that
i
am
had
never
suspected
pretty
violet
cared
for
me
a
little
and
could
only
be
happy
as
my
wife
dear
little
lina
and
she
asked
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
happiness
said
walter
deeply
moved
she
wished
me
to
marry
violet
perhaps
she
thought
in
making
happiness
i
might
find
my
own
ronald
answered
in
the
same
gentle
tone
walter
face
brightened
who
knows
but
that
you
will
he
exclaimed
my
sister
has
loved
you
deeply
for
years
ronald
god
grant
that
she
may
win
your
heart
and
make
you
happy
in
spite
of
yourself
how
strange
you
are
to
marry
violet
i
am
to
marry
lina
and
yet
in
this
way
the
tangled
web
of
our
destinies
may
be
straightened
out
at
last
after
the
first
day
or
two
of
terrible
suspense
and
anxiety
no
one
doubted
in
the
least
that
walter
would
recover
from
his
wound
happiness
had
a
magical
effect
upon
him
he
mended
rapidly
the
weeks
waned
and
the
engagement
with
manager
verne
was
drawing
to
its
close
she
refused
to
renew
it
although
he
offered
her
a
prince
ransom
for
another
month
walter
had
begged
her
to
give
up
a
public
life
and
she
had
assented
wearily
and
listlessly
professor
larue
had
been
shocked
and
disconcerted
at
her
resolve
but
she
had
told
him
for
the
first
time
all
her
sad
story
and
begged
him
to
forgive
her
for
disappointing
his
hopes
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
professor
larue
espoused
her
cause
heart
and
soul
in
the
heat
of
his
indignation
he
vowed
that
he
would
shoot
gerald
huntington
if
he
could
find
the
villain
it
was
not
easy
to
find
gerald
huntington
however
professor
larue
speedily
found
that
out
for
himself
as
the
next
best
thing
he
set
himself
to
work
to
secure
a
divorce
for
his
beloved
ward
he
found
it
even
easier
than
he
had
expected
that
bond
forged
by
fraud
and
violence
was
held
of
little
account
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
the
day
came
speedily
when
professor
larue
and
his
lawyer
came
smiling
into
the
presence
to
congratulate
her
and
tell
her
that
she
was
free
she
was
free
walter
earle
had
convalesced
so
fast
that
he
was
well
enough
to
go
to
church
now
and
he
pressed
for
an
early
marriage
jaquelina
yielded
hesitatingly
and
the
happy
day
was
named
for
one
week
after
wednesday
was
to
behold
her
last
triumphant
appearance
upon
the
stage
thursday
she
was
to
breathe
the
solemn
vows
that
would
make
her
the
wife
of
walter
earle
ronald
valchester
and
his
mother
had
returned
to
richmond
the
date
of
his
return
to
new
york
and
the
time
for
his
marriage
were
unfixed
as
yet
though
valchester
and
violet
secretly
hoped
it
would
not
be
long
delayed
chapter
xxxvi
it
was
wednesday
night
madame
dolores
stood
bowing
before
the
eager
admiring
throng
that
greeted
her
farewell
appearance
some
of
her
romantic
story
had
been
noised
abroad
it
was
rumored
that
the
morrow
would
behold
her
a
bride
and
there
were
not
a
few
who
envied
the
fortunate
walter
earle
and
his
sister
occupied
a
private
box
as
usual
he
looked
pale
and
thin
still
but
very
handsome
and
happy
and
his
blue
eyes
dwelt
adoringly
on
the
brilliant
beauty
of
his
promised
bride
violet
sitting
beside
him
in
rich
and
costly
attire
had
never
looked
more
lovely
how
perfectly
beautiful
lina
looks
she
whispered
to
her
brother
to
look
at
her
now
she
does
not
seem
like
the
lina
meredith
of
five
years
ago
do
you
remember
how
tanned
and
bashful
and
shabby
she
was
then
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
saw
and
her
jewels
are
worth
a
fortune
i
never
saw
such
magnificent
diamonds
then
the
curtain
rose
and
the
glorious
voice
of
madame
dolores
filled
the
vast
theater
with
entrancing
melody
they
turned
their
attention
to
the
stage
again
it
seemed
to
the
admirers
that
she
sang
and
acted
more
splendidly
than
ever
that
night
they
looked
and
listened
in
rapt
admiration
dreading
for
the
moment
to
arrive
when
that
heavy
curtain
should
fall
between
her
and
the
public
forever
there
was
one
scene
perhaps
the
most
interesting
and
thrilling
of
the
whole
opera
where
the
heroine
knelt
weeping
and
praying
at
the
feet
of
a
cruel
and
relentless
husband
madame
dolores
was
always
grand
in
this
scene
the
whole
audience
leaned
forward
now
breathless
and
eager
as
the
curtain
rose
upon
this
favorite
part
of
the
opera
the
scene
was
laid
in
a
dim
moorish
garden
in
the
shadow
of
a
ruined
temple
bathed
in
the
mystic
beams
of
moonlight
before
the
broken
archway
a
tall
dark
haughty
man
stood
with
folded
arms
looking
down
at
the
suppliant
kneeling
on
the
ground
her
loose
white
robe
dishevelled
her
dark
hair
broken
from
its
fillets
of
gold
and
flowing
in
careless
tresses
around
her
half
hiding
her
slender
form
in
its
luxuriant
veil
at
a
little
distance
stood
a
lovely
little
siren
who
had
lured
the
fickle
man
from
his
rightful
love
and
duty
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
not
on
his
sorrowful
pleading
wife
at
that
moment
when
the
attention
of
the
whole
vast
throng
was
concentrated
in
intense
silence
upon
the
scene
there
suddenly
broke
through
the
back
of
the
stage
a
vast
and
terrible
sheet
of
flame
that
lighted
the
whole
scene
with
a
crimson
deadly
glare
a
tumultuous
shriek
of
horror
and
despair
rose
from
the
throng
and
the
actors
rushed
wildly
forward
toward
the
footlights
in
a
frenzied
effort
at
escape
the
foot
became
entangled
in
her
flowing
robe
she
swayed
and
fell
forward
across
the
footlights
that
instantly
licked
the
soft
folds
of
her
dress
into
a
winding
sheet
of
flame
chapter
xxxvii
there
ensued
a
panic
that
baffled
description
one
impulse
moved
the
whole
excited
shrieking
throng
they
surged
forward
madly
toward
the
doors
and
windows
bent
on
escape
they
were
like
maniacs
for
the
time
the
weak
fell
down
beneath
the
feet
of
the
strong
and
were
heedlessly
trampled
while
groans
and
cries
sometimes
mixed
with
curses
divided
the
shuddering
air
violet
earle
had
shrieked
and
fainted
in
the
arms
of
her
brother
there
was
not
one
to
avert
the
awful
fate
of
her
who
a
single
moment
before
had
held
every
heart
enchained
by
the
power
of
her
beauty
and
genius
yes
there
was
one
one
only
it
seemed
in
an
instant
after
the
terrible
flames
had
wrapped
their
fiery
tongues
around
the
slender
form
of
the
a
man
sprang
over
the
footlights
upon
the
stage
at
one
rapid
bound
from
the
parquette
floor
he
had
caught
up
a
heavy
shawl
dropped
by
a
lady
in
her
hurried
flight
rushing
forward
utterly
heedless
of
the
advancing
flames
that
scorched
his
face
and
his
hair
he
threw
the
heavy
shawl
over
the
blazing
form
and
smothered
out
the
fire
then
lifting
the
senseless
girl
in
his
arms
he
made
his
way
with
the
greatest
difficulty
to
a
door
and
forced
his
way
through
the
striving
mass
of
human
beings
out
upon
the
thronged
pavement
the
carriage
was
waiting
on
the
pavement
and
professor
larue
who
had
come
with
it
a
minute
before
was
darting
frantically
up
and
down
ceaselessly
around
the
doors
of
the
doomed
building
afterward
professor
larue
told
how
a
tall
man
with
a
face
so
blackened
with
fire
and
soot
as
to
be
quite
unrecognizable
had
put
jaquelina
into
his
arms
and
fallen
fainting
on
the
pavement
someone
had
attended
to
him
he
could
not
tell
who
for
he
had
been
so
distracted
with
grief
and
horror
over
the
tragic
fate
of
his
ward
he
had
not
waited
to
see
but
all
inquiry
afterward
failed
to
discover
the
rescuer
of
the
no
one
had
recognized
him
no
one
knew
where
he
went
or
whence
he
came
professor
larue
in
the
gratitude
of
his
heart
wished
to
discover
him
and
reward
him
generously
but
his
persistent
inquiries
through
the
personal
column
of
the
elicited
no
reply
the
man
was
modest
as
well
as
brave
he
did
not
wish
to
be
known
walter
earle
had
had
a
most
terrible
time
getting
his
unconscious
sister
out
of
the
building
his
heart
was
distracted
with
grief
over
the
tragic
fate
which
had
overtaken
his
darling
but
for
the
encumbrance
of
his
sister
he
would
have
rushed
out
in
an
attempt
to
reach
jaquelina
through
that
struggling
mass
of
maddened
humanity
but
violet
lay
like
an
inert
helpless
burden
on
his
hands
it
was
only
by
superhuman
efforts
that
he
ever
reached
the
outer
world
with
her
then
when
he
had
put
her
in
a
carriage
taken
her
home
and
had
seen
her
revive
he
drove
rapidly
back
to
the
theater
they
told
him
there
that
a
stranger
had
leaped
upon
the
burning
stage
and
smothered
the
flames
that
enveloped
the
she
was
saved
from
that
terrible
holocaust
of
flame
then
walter
cried
out
almost
wild
with
the
joy
of
the
tidings
but
no
one
could
tell
him
whether
madame
dolores
was
living
or
not
her
rescuer
had
carried
her
out
of
the
burning
building
and
placed
her
in
the
arms
of
professor
larue
he
had
carried
her
away
and
no
one
knew
anything
further
as
yet
walter
drove
to
the
hotel
where
the
professor
and
his
wife
were
staying
with
their
ward
he
sent
up
his
card
and
the
professor
came
down
to
him
they
looked
at
each
other
silently
a
moment
then
walter
breathed
lina
through
white
lips
that
could
scarcely
utter
that
simple
name
professor
larue
shook
his
head
sadly
do
not
tell
me
she
is
dead
walter
exclaimed
in
an
agony
of
fear
and
dread
she
lives
the
professor
answered
if
a
mere
wavering
breath
may
be
called
living
but
she
is
horribly
horribly
burned
and
her
sufferings
are
fearful
half
a
dozen
doctors
are
with
her
this
moment
they
will
save
her
life
if
it
is
possible
to
accomplish
it
thank
god
she
lives
walter
exclaimed
and
hurried
away
to
carry
the
welcome
news
to
violet
while
the
almost
old
professor
hurried
back
to
that
quiet
chamber
where
the
angels
of
life
and
death
were
striving
together
over
jaquelina
meredith
scorched
and
writhing
frame
so
the
bridal
day
dawned
dark
and
gloomy
and
overcast
and
jaquelina
lay
upon
her
couch
of
pain
swathed
from
head
to
foot
in
bandages
of
linen
while
the
breath
of
life
wavered
unevenly
between
the
pallid
parted
lips
and
every
gasp
was
one
of
almost
unendurable
anguish
and
the
morning
papers
which
chronicled
the
particulars
of
the
great
fire
told
the
public
that
madam
dolores
would
live
but
she
had
been
so
horribly
burned
even
to
her
face
and
hands
that
her
beauty
would
be
marred
and
ruined
forever
the
physicians
were
of
the
opinion
that
her
exquisite
voice
would
be
destroyed
also
she
would
be
a
perfect
physical
wreck
i
do
not
believe
it
walter
earle
cried
out
in
passionate
unbelief
and
he
went
to
the
physicians
and
asked
them
for
the
truth
they
were
very
sorry
for
him
but
they
confirmed
the
newspaper
reports
they
believed
that
madame
dolores
would
carry
those
terrible
scars
on
her
face
to
the
grave
and
they
did
not
think
it
possible
that
she
would
ever
sing
again
i
would
rather
she
had
died
than
lose
all
her
charms
walter
cried
to
his
own
heart
in
a
perfect
fever
of
regret
and
despair
and
he
went
to
the
hotel
and
begged
larue
to
let
him
see
jaquelina
if
but
for
a
moment
the
professor
wife
refused
flatly
she
said
that
lina
was
far
too
ill
to
see
anyone
and
that
the
lightest
footstep
in
the
room
set
her
wild
with
nervous
pain
he
must
wait
it
would
be
some
time
three
weeks
perhaps
before
he
could
be
admitted
to
the
room
almost
distracted
with
his
trouble
the
young
man
returned
to
violet
who
was
still
suffering
from
the
effects
of
her
last
night
shock
and
excitement
he
was
surprised
to
find
ronald
valchester
in
the
with
his
sister
ronald
looking
pale
and
ill
with
his
right
arm
carried
in
a
sling
ronald
you
here
he
cried
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
when
did
you
arrive
last
night
said
ronald
briefly
you
changed
your
mind
about
coming
to
my
marriage
did
you
not
ronald
smiled
and
did
not
reply
oh
ronald
is
it
not
terrible
cried
walter
my
poor
little
lina
her
beautiful
voice
and
her
beautiful
face
ruined
forever
her
life
is
spared
at
least
ronald
answered
in
a
low
grateful
voice
if
i
had
been
lina
i
would
rather
have
died
than
have
lost
my
voice
and
my
beauty
cried
violet
she
will
have
nothing
left
to
live
for
now
she
will
have
walter
love
said
ronald
valchester
gravely
and
violet
saw
that
he
was
regarding
her
with
a
slight
air
of
surprise
oh
yes
i
had
forgotten
that
she
said
quickly
but
it
is
dreadful
for
walter
he
is
such
a
and
he
thought
lina
the
most
beautiful
girl
he
ever
saw
walter
changed
the
conversation
quickly
by
asking
ronald
what
was
wrong
with
his
arm
that
he
wore
it
in
a
sling
and
his
friend
replied
briefly
that
he
had
been
hurt
by
a
slight
accident
that
was
all
the
explanation
he
volunteered
chapter
xxxviii
the
day
came
when
jaquelina
was
well
enough
to
sit
up
in
her
darkened
chamber
again
then
they
sent
word
to
violet
earle
that
she
might
come
to
see
her
one
day
and
walter
the
next
ronald
valchester
had
gone
back
to
richmond
on
the
same
day
that
he
had
heard
that
jaquelina
would
live
violet
had
fretted
about
him
continually
she
had
never
been
quite
well
since
the
night
of
the
fire
the
terrible
shock
had
wakened
her
nerves
and
her
heart
she
was
anxious
to
go
back
to
laurel
hill
but
walter
would
not
hear
of
such
a
thing
yet
not
until
lina
is
better
he
urged
when
she
is
well
enough
to
travel
we
will
be
quietly
married
and
then
we
will
take
her
back
to
laurel
hill
with
us
violet
grew
very
impatient
in
the
weary
weeks
of
waiting
she
fancied
she
would
see
ronald
oftener
if
she
were
only
back
in
virginia
he
wrote
to
her
sometimes
simple
friendly
notes
such
as
he
had
written
her
from
abroad
two
years
before
but
he
had
never
asked
her
to
name
the
yet
she
was
very
glad
when
they
sent
her
word
that
jaquelina
was
well
enough
to
receive
a
visit
from
her
they
should
have
given
me
the
first
chance
of
paying
her
a
visit
complained
walter
he
did
not
know
that
jaquelina
had
purposely
planned
it
so
she
wished
that
violet
would
break
to
him
the
news
of
her
changed
appearance
before
he
saw
her
himself
violet
went
away
from
that
visit
to
the
darkened
invalid
chamber
awed
and
saddened
and
a
little
she
remembered
how
bitterly
she
had
used
to
hate
jaquelina
for
that
dazzling
beauty
that
had
won
ronald
valchester
heart
of
all
that
wondrous
charm
there
remained
only
a
memory
now
she
is
an
object
to
pity
and
sympathize
with
but
never
to
admire
again
she
told
her
brother
in
the
first
shock
of
his
disappointment
walter
handsome
face
grew
pale
with
dread
and
sorrow
you
must
prepare
yourself
for
a
great
alteration
walter
violet
continued
her
face
is
red
and
scarred
her
hair
is
all
burned
off
short
even
her
long
lashes
are
scorched
and
spoiled
it
will
be
some
time
before
anyone
can
look
at
her
without
a
shudder
you
may
love
your
wife
walter
but
you
can
never
be
proud
of
her
walter
shuddered
at
her
emphatic
words
do
not
tell
me
any
more
violet
he
groaned
i
can
not
bear
it
you
only
torture
me
let
me
find
it
out
for
myself
if
you
can
not
bear
to
hear
of
it
i
do
not
know
how
you
will
bear
the
terrible
reality
retorted
violet
walter
could
not
answer
her
he
longed
yet
dreaded
for
the
morrow
the
first
thing
he
saw
when
he
was
ushered
into
jaquelina
presence
was
her
portrait
hanging
against
the
wall
it
had
been
painted
by
the
first
artist
in
italy
a
few
pale
beams
of
winter
sunshine
stole
in
through
the
closed
curtains
and
shone
on
the
beautiful
pictured
face
touching
it
with
a
glow
then
walter
looked
away
from
it
and
saw
a
little
figure
in
a
quilted
of
dark
gray
satin
huddled
into
an
before
the
fire
walter
went
up
to
his
betrothed
he
saw
that
some
uncontrollable
impulse
had
caused
her
to
bury
her
poor
scarred
face
in
her
small
gloved
hands
the
short
soft
dark
hair
was
hidden
beneath
a
little
cap
of
fine
muslin
and
lace
lina
my
darling
he
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
yearning
pain
and
she
looked
up
reluctantly
at
her
lover
then
walter
saw
that
even
violet
words
had
not
prepared
him
for
the
sorrowful
reality
to
have
saved
his
life
he
could
not
have
repressed
the
groan
of
anguish
that
sight
wrung
from
his
lips
he
had
so
loved
that
bright
fascinating
beauty
he
had
been
so
proud
of
it
when
she
had
promised
to
be
his
own
now
at
this
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
girl
he
had
loved
was
dead
and
buried
and
this
an
utter
stranger
who
looked
up
at
him
with
that
poor
scarred
face
and
those
dim
and
sad
dark
eyes
sit
down
earle
she
said
gently
it
is
even
worse
than
you
imagined
is
it
not
yes
he
answered
like
one
dazed
then
started
ashamed
of
his
candor
oh
forgive
me
lina
he
cried
i
am
talking
like
a
brute
he
sat
down
then
and
tried
not
to
look
at
the
poor
face
that
reminded
him
of
a
blighted
flower
but
some
irresistible
fascination
drew
his
own
gaze
to
meet
the
wistful
eyes
that
had
lost
all
their
brightness
now
and
were
dim
and
misty
with
pain
and
weakness
do
i
look
at
all
like
my
old
self
she
asked
him
and
he
answered
almost
bluntly
no
in
the
next
breath
he
went
on
in
a
kind
of
passionate
despair
oh
lina
you
were
so
beautiful
and
i
loved
your
beauty
so
well
it
almost
kills
me
to
see
how
utterly
you
have
lost
it
did
you
prize
my
poor
beauty
so
much
she
inquired
with
a
faint
sigh
she
read
his
answer
in
the
anguished
eyes
he
turned
upon
her
face
she
saw
that
in
losing
her
peerless
beauty
she
had
lost
her
charm
for
him
after
a
moment
she
said
gently
and
gravely
the
physicians
believe
that
my
face
is
spoiled
forever
walter
they
are
not
sure
but
the
shock
and
the
illness
have
ruined
my
voice
also
how
could
you
bear
to
have
a
wife
whom
you
must
always
pity
for
her
misfortunes
but
could
never
worship
for
her
fairness
he
did
not
answer
but
jaquelina
saw
that
the
words
had
touched
a
tender
spot
in
his
heart
he
bit
his
lips
beneath
his
fair
mustache
and
an
anxious
gleam
came
into
his
blue
eyes
i
have
been
looking
at
my
poor
marred
face
in
the
glass
she
went
on
in
her
low
sad
voice
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
one
could
ever
love
me
any
more
it
is
not
fair
to
hold
you
to
your
promise
now
i
will
give
you
back
your
freedom
walter
if
you
will
accept
it
from
me
lina
she
scarcely
understood
whether
it
was
relief
or
reproach
that
quivered
in
his
quick
exclamation
it
shall
be
just
as
you
wish
she
said
quickly
if
you
claim
my
promise
i
am
yours
if
i
have
lost
your
love
in
losing
my
beauty
you
are
free
lina
would
it
pain
you
if
i
take
you
at
your
word
he
asked
in
a
low
abashed
voice
no
she
answered
with
gentle
frankness
you
would
not
despise
me
he
asked
anxiously
without
looking
at
her
no
she
said
again
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
half
irresolute
do
not
fear
to
express
your
preference
she
said
gently
either
way
i
stand
willing
to
abide
by
the
consequences
then
lina
since
you
are
so
generous
i
will
take
my
freedom
he
blurted
out
looking
away
from
her
very
red
and
ashamed
i
am
unworthy
of
you
my
dear
i
see
now
that
it
was
only
your
beauty
that
held
me
in
thrall
can
you
forgive
me
for
being
so
weak
and
shallow
i
am
not
angry
with
you
earle
she
replied
gently
most
men
would
have
felt
the
same
would
they
not
but
in
her
heart
she
felt
that
there
was
one
at
least
whose
fealty
would
not
have
faltered
yes
most
men
would
i
think
he
replied
and
when
he
had
made
lina
promise
that
she
would
still
remain
his
friend
he
went
away
to
tell
violet
what
had
occurred
it
was
a
weak
and
shallow
love
after
all
she
mused
when
she
was
thus
left
alone
by
her
recreant
lover
i
am
glad
he
has
found
it
out
in
time
and
i
am
oh
so
glad
that
i
need
not
marry
walter
earle
and
with
clasped
hands
jaquelina
thanked
god
for
the
accident
which
had
deprived
her
of
all
her
charms
and
set
her
free
from
her
engagement
for
she
had
realized
from
the
first
that
there
could
be
nothing
more
galling
in
life
than
the
bonds
she
had
forged
in
her
gratitude
for
walter
brave
quarrel
with
gerald
huntington
yet
life
looked
very
long
and
lonely
to
the
tearful
dark
eyes
as
she
sat
there
musing
she
began
to
realise
that
love
beautiful
love
had
gone
out
of
her
life
forever
chapter
xxxix
violet
earle
was
not
surprised
at
her
brother
action
she
was
rather
relieved
by
it
the
first
shock
over
she
was
rather
glad
that
jaquelina
had
lost
all
her
charms
ronald
valchester
had
nothing
to
regret
now
the
beauty
he
had
loved
was
lost
forever
the
day
before
she
returned
home
she
went
to
see
jaquelina
she
was
curious
to
know
what
her
generous
rival
proposed
to
do
with
her
blank
and
ruined
life
do
you
really
intend
to
return
to
europe
as
you
said
you
would
she
asked
her
yes
i
am
going
back
after
awhile
jaquelina
answered
but
first
i
am
going
to
pay
a
visit
to
virginia
i
have
had
a
letter
from
my
uncle
meredith
and
he
has
invited
me
to
pay
him
a
visit
i
do
not
believe
you
would
enjoy
a
visit
to
meredith
farm
said
violet
quickly
meredith
has
become
involved
in
debt
somehow
and
there
is
a
mortgage
on
the
whole
estate
his
wife
is
crosser
than
ever
and
she
has
two
more
children
yes
i
know
uncle
charlie
wrote
me
about
all
his
troubles
jaquelina
answered
simply
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
mean
to
do
violet
i
shall
pay
off
the
mortgage
on
the
farm
and
settle
thousand
dollars
on
uncle
meredith
so
that
he
may
get
a
new
start
in
life
pretty
violet
rustling
in
her
silks
and
furs
looked
at
her
with
incredulous
surprise
lina
you
are
not
in
earnest
she
said
yes
i
am
quite
in
earnest
i
have
more
money
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
and
i
am
going
to
help
uncle
charlie
out
of
his
difficulty
they
have
not
been
so
kind
to
you
lina
that
you
need
trouble
yourself
over
them
said
violet
her
mind
going
back
to
the
old
days
when
jaquelina
had
been
the
patient
nurse
and
drudge
neglected
and
uncared
for
i
know
said
lina
i
have
not
forgotten
the
past
but
i
am
sorry
for
them
all
the
same
and
then
too
violet
you
must
remember
her
voice
sank
slightly
lower
i
can
never
have
any
more
happiness
in
life
except
what
i
can
make
for
others
violet
and
her
brother
returned
south
the
next
day
violet
had
promised
valchester
to
spend
a
few
days
with
her
in
richmond
before
she
went
to
laurel
hill
she
felt
quite
sure
of
having
ronald
all
to
herself
then
what
was
her
dismay
to
find
him
preparing
to
leave
for
new
york
again
the
very
day
she
arrived
in
richmond
were
you
growing
impatient
at
my
lengthened
stay
she
asked
him
fondly
it
was
walter
that
kept
me
i
was
very
anxious
to
get
back
to
you
i
thought
walter
intended
to
have
brought
back
a
bride
with
him
ignoring
her
first
question
oh
did
not
walter
tell
you
she
cried
out
carelessly
the
engagement
is
off
i
do
not
think
i
understand
you
ronald
replied
the
engagement
is
broken
they
are
not
to
be
married
she
explained
why
not
gravely
oh
valchester
she
is
so
changed
you
know
said
violet
a
little
disconcerted
by
his
grave
eyes
she
has
lost
her
voice
and
her
beauty
she
offered
walter
his
freedom
and
he
was
glad
enough
to
accept
it
i
could
not
have
believed
it
of
walter
said
ronald
valchester
sturdily
oh
valchester
she
is
a
perfect
fright
you
would
not
blame
walter
if
you
could
see
how
she
looks
cried
violet
warmly
defending
walter
course
ronald
said
no
more
he
had
turned
to
go
you
are
not
going
to
new
york
now
what
is
the
use
when
i
am
already
here
she
cried
in
dismay
then
ronald
answered
with
a
slight
flush
excuse
me
violet
at
the
risk
of
seeming
rude
i
must
tell
you
i
was
not
going
after
you
exactly
i
am
publishing
another
volume
of
poetry
and
i
was
going
to
new
york
on
urgent
business
you
were
going
to
see
jaquelina
violet
broke
out
in
a
sudden
passion
of
anger
and
jealousy
and
then
she
threw
herself
on
a
sofa
and
burst
into
bitter
weeping
ronald
stood
looking
at
her
in
amazement
he
did
not
kneel
down
by
her
and
kiss
away
the
tears
as
she
expected
him
to
do
he
said
sadly
and
gravely
violet
this
is
quite
unworthy
of
you
you
must
remember
that
lina
herself
gave
me
to
you
i
have
small
pleasure
in
the
gift
she
retorted
i
but
seldom
see
you
the
passionate
complaint
opened
ronald
eyes
he
bent
down
and
touched
his
affianced
cheek
with
his
lips
while
he
said
quietly
violet
when
i
return
from
new
york
i
shall
ask
you
to
name
our
wedding
day
you
must
think
about
it
while
i
am
gone
when
when
will
you
return
sobbed
violet
with
a
smile
struggling
through
her
tears
in
about
two
weeks
i
think
said
ronald
two
weeks
longer
i
shall
be
gone
to
laurel
hill
before
that
time
she
said
disappointed
i
do
not
think
i
can
get
back
any
sooner
than
that
he
answered
but
i
will
come
to
laurel
hill
as
soon
as
i
return
you
promise
she
said
faithfully
i
promise
faithfully
he
replied
with
a
slight
smile
at
her
anxiety
he
went
away
and
violet
was
obliged
to
content
herself
with
the
thought
of
seeing
him
again
in
two
weeks
she
returned
to
her
mountain
home
where
she
found
her
father
very
glad
to
see
her
again
in
a
week
time
she
heard
that
jaquelina
meredith
had
returned
to
the
farm
on
a
visit
to
her
uncle
chapter
xl
may
i
see
you
for
a
little
while
lina
i
have
important
news
for
you
it
was
two
weeks
after
jaquelina
had
come
to
the
that
she
stood
holding
ronald
valchester
card
in
her
trembling
hand
and
reading
the
few
lines
scribbled
upon
it
her
uncle
charlie
had
brought
it
to
her
he
told
her
that
valchester
was
waiting
outside
she
started
up
nervously
when
meredith
gave
her
ronald
card
and
told
her
that
he
was
waiting
to
see
her
an
impulse
came
over
her
to
decline
to
grant
him
the
interview
he
asked
he
has
come
to
tell
me
when
he
will
be
married
to
violet
she
said
to
her
wildly
beating
heart
i
i
am
not
so
strong
as
i
thought
i
was
i
do
not
believe
i
could
bear
it
it
was
cruel
to
come
i
should
not
have
thought
it
of
ronald
he
must
have
known
how
it
would
hurt
me
oh
i
should
not
have
come
here
so
near
to
the
sight
of
violet
happiness
then
it
crossed
her
mind
that
she
was
weak
and
selfish
she
had
begged
him
to
marry
violet
she
must
be
brave
enough
to
bear
what
she
had
caused
uncle
charlie
you
may
tell
him
to
come
in
she
said
with
lips
that
trembled
strangely
then
when
he
had
gone
out
and
closed
the
door
she
drooped
into
a
chair
and
hid
her
poor
marred
face
in
her
hands
she
could
not
bear
for
ronald
valchester
to
behold
it
in
its
changed
and
altered
guise
she
heard
the
door
open
softly
then
ronald
unforgotten
step
as
he
crossed
the
floor
she
could
not
look
up
he
knelt
down
beside
her
and
took
one
of
the
hands
that
hid
her
face
and
held
it
tightly
in
his
own
lina
look
at
me
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
as
tender
as
a
caress
do
not
be
afraid
to
show
me
your
sad
affliction
jaquelina
looked
up
with
something
like
a
sob
into
the
handsome
thoughtful
face
of
her
lost
lover
it
was
beaming
with
an
eager
joy
and
tenderness
that
was
like
the
expression
she
remembered
on
it
in
the
brief
happy
summer
of
their
betrothal
even
when
he
saw
the
face
that
had
frightened
walter
earle
love
away
no
change
came
into
the
eyes
fixed
on
her
with
such
adoring
love
blent
with
such
sweet
seriousness
lina
do
not
grieve
for
the
beauty
you
have
lost
he
said
i
am
so
thankful
that
your
life
is
spared
that
all
else
is
of
little
account
the
sad
dark
eyes
regarded
him
in
wonder
yes
darling
he
said
with
a
smile
into
the
wondering
eyes
all
that
you
have
suffered
only
makes
you
dearer
to
my
heart
she
pulled
her
small
hand
from
his
clasp
and
tried
to
rise
valchester
you
must
not
speak
to
me
so
she
cried
you
forget
violet
you
forget
everything
i
forget
nothing
he
returned
listen
lina
i
did
not
come
here
simply
to
pain
you
i
have
news
for
you
gerald
huntington
is
dead
chapter
xli
at
those
words
from
her
lover
lips
jaquelina
gasped
for
breath
like
one
dying
her
head
fell
heavily
back
against
her
chair
and
her
eyelids
closed
ronald
bent
over
her
in
surprise
and
alarm
lina
did
i
tell
you
too
suddenly
he
exclaimed
chafing
the
limp
and
nerveless
hands
forgive
me
i
forgot
how
weak
and
nervous
you
must
be
yet
it
was
a
shock
to
her
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
she
lay
silent
several
minutes
her
heart
throbbing
quick
and
fast
it
was
some
little
while
before
she
could
speak
when
she
did
she
uttered
only
one
word
through
pale
lips
when
almost
a
week
ago
now
he
replied
are
you
strong
enough
for
me
to
tell
you
about
it
lina
yes
she
replied
and
he
drew
a
chair
to
her
side
will
you
suffer
me
to
hold
your
hand
while
i
am
telling
you
lina
he
inquired
fondly
she
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
for
a
moment
then
she
answered
with
a
slight
flush
no
i
would
rather
you
should
not
do
so
a
troubled
look
came
into
the
eyes
a
moment
as
they
rested
on
the
leaping
flames
of
the
fire
then
he
said
with
apparent
composure
you
knew
i
had
been
in
new
york
for
two
weeks
lina
no
i
did
not
know
it
she
replied
surprised
true
how
should
you
know
it
he
said
half
to
himself
well
i
was
and
last
week
professor
larue
called
on
me
at
my
hotel
the
dear
old
soul
i
hope
he
was
well
exclaimed
jaquelina
warmly
yes
he
was
well
said
ronald
valchester
and
very
impatient
for
your
return
to
new
york
a
dying
man
had
sent
for
you
and
when
he
found
that
you
were
out
of
reach
he
called
for
me
you
went
said
lina
looking
at
him
with
wide
dark
eyes
yes
lina
judge
of
my
surprise
when
in
an
obscure
and
comfortless
abode
in
the
suburbs
of
brooklyn
i
found
the
handsome
outlaw
gerald
huntington
stretched
upon
his
dying
bed
dying
jaquelina
repeated
after
him
with
something
like
awe
in
her
low
voice
yes
dying
but
dying
ashamed
and
repentant
there
was
a
priest
with
him
he
passed
away
peacefully
and
he
sent
for
me
the
girl
said
wonderingly
yes
he
sent
for
you
and
he
was
very
much
disappointed
and
grieved
that
you
were
too
far
away
to
come
in
time
he
wished
to
ask
your
forgiveness
for
the
cowardly
revenge
he
took
upon
you
for
the
you
did
him
once
i
have
been
so
sorry
for
it
she
said
weakly
and
blushing
crimson
i
was
so
young
and
untutored
i
did
not
think
it
was
all
because
i
needed
the
money
so
much
if
i
could
have
seen
him
on
his
dying
bed
i
would
have
asked
him
to
forgive
me
my
sin
of
ingratitude
and
i
must
have
forgiven
him
for
the
revenge
he
took
i
could
not
have
refused
to
forgive
him
when
he
was
dying
yes
i
told
him
that
said
ronald
i
understood
you
so
well
lina
i
knew
just
what
you
would
say
and
feel
i
told
him
to
rest
quite
easy
about
that
lina
thanked
him
with
a
grateful
glance
quickly
withdrawn
he
had
sinned
against
you
too
she
said
tremulously
that
dreadful
wound
you
forgave
him
ronald
freely
he
replied
and
then
they
were
silent
a
moment
and
lina
looked
at
the
softly
falling
snow
through
the
windows
and
ronald
looked
at
her
steadily
and
gravely
he
did
not
flinch
as
his
eyes
marked
the
scarred
discolored
skin
that
covered
the
once
delicately
lovely
face
after
a
pause
ronald
said
gravely
huntington
had
a
confession
to
make
to
you
lina
a
confession
she
repeated
turning
her
dark
eyes
from
the
window
to
look
at
him
with
grave
surprise
yes
he
said
you
must
have
wondered
lina
often
and
often
what
mysterious
discovery
caused
him
to
give
you
up
in
the
very
moment
when
by
violence
he
had
made
you
his
bride
i
have
wondered
over
it
often
it
was
the
happy
cause
that
delivered
me
from
a
life
more
bitter
than
death
she
replied
with
a
shudder
he
explained
it
to
me
lina
and
perhaps
i
should
leave
the
story
untold
to
you
are
you
willing
for
me
to
do
so
he
inquired
lina
meditated
a
moment
then
replied
i
would
prefer
to
hear
it
spoken
like
a
true
daughter
of
eve
said
her
companion
with
a
slight
smile
very
well
lina
i
will
do
as
you
say
but
i
fear
it
will
pain
you
to
hear
my
story
and
there
is
one
thing
you
must
promise
me
you
will
tell
no
one
else
yes
i
will
promise
that
she
replied
listen
to
a
bit
of
the
outlaw
history
then
he
said
in
the
first
place
his
true
name
was
not
gerald
huntington
at
all
then
what
said
lina
and
paused
abruptly
it
was
an
he
adopted
when
he
fell
into
evil
and
wicked
courses
he
belonged
to
a
family
in
france
he
was
not
an
american
lina
he
was
french
lina
eyes
were
a
little
startled
as
she
looked
up
at
him
a
sight
pallor
crept
about
her
lips
he
was
the
younger
son
of
a
man
who
was
so
severely
just
lina
and
so
proud
and
passionate
withal
that
his
children
feared
him
instead
of
loving
him
his
eldest
daughter
ran
away
with
a
young
american
artist
and
died
under
virginian
skies
in
only
a
few
brief
months
his
younger
son
maddened
by
the
sternness
and
harshness
of
his
only
parent
also
ran
away
to
america
he
fell
into
temptation
yielded
blindly
to
evil
and
cast
aside
forever
the
noble
name
he
had
disgraced
he
paused
and
jaquelina
regarded
him
with
wild
wondering
eyes
lina
i
need
not
tell
you
more
he
said
you
can
guess
she
lifted
her
small
hands
dizzily
to
her
brow
tell
me
yourself
she
said
i
am
so
dazed
it
seems
to
me
i
can
not
understand
unless
i
hear
the
very
words
he
said
them
over
reluctantly
enough
gerald
huntington
true
name
is
ardelle
your
mother
little
lina
was
his
elder
sister
he
was
your
own
uncle
your
mother
jewelry
revealed
your
true
identity
to
him
that
night
a
moan
of
pain
came
from
the
girl
white
lips
as
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
brow
my
own
uncle
she
cried
oh
the
shame
and
disgrace
of
it
it
is
a
buried
secret
he
replied
no
one
will
ever
know
i
promised
him
that
myself
lina
he
died
repentant
i
believe
that
a
noble
nature
was
marred
when
gerald
ardelle
with
his
princely
beauty
and
glorious
intellect
fell
into
evil
ways
but
he
died
repentant
she
murmured
hopefully
yes
he
was
very
sorry
for
his
sins
replied
ronald
he
regretted
his
sin
against
you
the
most
of
all
after
a
moment
he
added
gently
his
dearest
wish
lina
was
that
you
and
i
might
be
she
put
up
her
hands
as
if
she
could
not
bear
the
words
he
was
full
of
life
and
strength
she
said
why
did
he
die
what
killed
him
ronald
you
will
not
be
shocked
if
i
tell
you
he
said
hesitatingly
i
wish
to
know
she
answered
he
was
in
the
theater
the
night
you
were
burned
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
he
tried
to
save
your
life
dear
he
leaped
from
the
upper
tier
into
the
parquette
fell
and
was
almost
trampled
to
death
beneath
the
feet
of
the
maddened
multitude
he
died
a
slow
and
painful
death
from
internal
injuries
he
died
for
me
jaquelina
cried
in
a
voice
of
pain
and
the
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
for
the
man
who
had
wrecked
her
life
and
given
his
own
so
freely
at
last
for
her
sake
ronald
wiped
those
tears
away
and
when
she
could
speak
she
said
looking
gravely
at
him
ronald
who
was
it
that
saved
my
life
tell
me
no
one
knows
he
replied
uneasily
yes
ronald
know
i
have
always
known
she
replied
ah
do
not
blush
i
have
never
breathed
it
to
anyone
but
i
know
that
it
was
you
that
saved
me
from
death
that
night
i
thought
you
insensible
he
exclaimed
unconsciously
admitting
the
truth
of
her
words
ah
ronald
she
cried
with
sudden
uncontrollable
pain
and
passion
i
was
almost
dead
but
i
knew
whose
arms
held
me
and
whose
lips
kissed
me
it
seems
to
me
if
i
were
dead
and
you
touched
me
even
i
should
surely
know
it
ah
lina
my
darling
he
cried
there
are
no
barriers
between
us
now
all
are
broken
you
will
be
my
own
at
last
she
looked
at
her
lover
with
dark
despairing
eyes
and
a
face
you
forget
violet
she
said
in
a
desolate
whisper
she
saw
a
dark
shadow
come
over
the
handsome
face
lina
i
have
not
told
you
all
that
gerald
huntington
told
me
yet
he
said
do
you
remember
that
it
was
a
disguised
woman
who
liberated
him
from
prison
yes
she
replied
wonderingly
it
was
violet
who
connived
at
his
escape
and
furnished
him
the
means
to
get
away
safely
the
price
of
her
aid
was
that
he
should
kidnap
you
and
prevent
our
marriage
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
cried
the
girl
it
is
quite
true
he
answered
gerald
swore
to
it
violet
does
not
deny
it
you
did
not
charge
her
with
it
the
girl
cried
in
breathless
dismay
yes
he
replied
firmly
she
was
very
angry
at
first
but
when
i
had
talked
to
her
awhile
she
owned
the
truth
she
had
visited
the
prisoner
and
they
had
concocted
their
diabolical
plan
of
revenge
together
she
hated
you
dear
because
she
loved
me
and
she
gave
you
back
your
freedom
lina
said
with
unconscious
hopefulness
yes
when
i
had
asked
her
he
answered
with
a
slight
flush
her
offense
had
been
too
great
for
me
to
marry
her
do
you
blame
me
lina
she
would
not
say
only
asked
him
anxiously
was
violet
repentant
she
was
sorry
she
had
been
found
out
and
very
angry
with
gerald
huntington
for
betraying
the
secret
i
do
not
believe
she
has
reached
the
verge
of
repentance
just
yet
poor
violet
the
girl
said
with
infinite
compassion
you
will
not
tell
anyone
about
it
ronald
no
darling
i
promised
her
i
would
not
many
people
have
secrets
hidden
in
their
lives
this
will
be
one
in
violet
and
gerald
huntington
near
kinship
to
you
will
be
one
in
yours
i
did
not
even
tell
walter
her
story
i
gave
her
the
privilege
of
saying
she
had
jilted
me
you
will
not
mind
taking
a
man
who
has
been
jilted
will
you
lina
she
looked
at
the
handsome
happy
face
with
the
eager
light
of
hope
shining
in
the
eyes
and
her
lips
quivered
years
had
passed
since
she
had
seen
the
light
of
happiness
shining
on
ronald
valchester
face
ronald
i
must
not
take
you
now
she
said
i
am
not
the
lina
you
loved
years
ago
i
have
lost
my
beauty
you
will
always
be
beautiful
to
me
he
answered
loyally
lina
my
love
was
no
weak
shallow
passion
for
a
fair
face
such
as
walter
earle
cherished
for
you
it
was
not
altogether
your
beauty
that
won
me
first
there
was
about
you
a
singular
unconscious
fascination
a
luring
charm
sweet
and
subtle
as
the
fragrance
of
a
flower
that
won
me
even
against
my
will
that
nameless
charm
lingers
about
you
still
though
your
wondrous
fairness
has
faded
like
a
flower
you
remember
may
break
you
may
shatter
the
vase
if
you
will
but
the
scent
of
the
roses
will
cling
round
it
still
so
although
you
have
lost
your
beauty
lina
the
real
undefinable
charm
that
held
me
holds
me
still
lina
looked
at
him
with
dewy
eyes
his
whole
handsome
eager
face
was
lighted
with
the
tenderness
of
his
heart
he
took
her
small
hands
and
held
them
fondly
in
his
own
lina
we
were
made
for
each
other
he
pleaded
we
both
love
poetry
music
and
everything
beautiful
fate
has
been
hard
and
unkind
to
us
but
she
has
relented
at
last
you
are
going
to
be
my
wife
lina
could
not
resist
his
pleading
and
the
gentle
arm
that
stole
around
her
she
hid
her
face
on
his
breast
and
wept
the
happiest
tears
that
ever
rained
from
a
happy
woman
eyes
she
had
loved
ronald
so
long
and
so
well
and
she
was
going
to
be
his
wife
at
last
only
one
month
later
they
were
happily
married
amid
the
rejoicings
of
all
the
neighborhood
general
and
valchester
were
present
and
seemed
very
happy
in
the
happiness
of
their
idolized
son
earle
was
also
present
but
walter
and
violet
sent
regrets
their
father
said
that
they
were
very
busy
making
arrangements
for
a
long
projected
tour
abroad
meredith
to
her
husband
niece
was
a
mysterious
box
swathed
around
with
silver
paper
ronald
was
quite
mystified
to
hear
her
say
gratefully
when
she
received
it
a
thousand
thanks
aunt
meredith
i
would
rather
have
this
box
than
crœsus
fortune
it
has
been
frequently
said
that
women
have
all
the
curiosity
in
the
world
and
men
none
at
all
but
ronald
valchester
was
exceedingly
curious
over
his
wife
bridal
gift
he
thought
over
it
several
times
and
at
last
he
said
to
her
lina
my
darling
what
precious
gift
was
that
which
your
uncle
wife
gave
you
on
your
they
were
in
richmond
then
spending
the
very
quietly
at
general
valchester
splendid
residence
at
the
west
end
lina
was
too
sensitive
over
her
marred
beauty
to
allow
them
to
persuade
her
into
society
and
gayety
she
took
ronald
white
fingers
now
and
passed
them
gently
over
her
cheeks
ronald
she
said
do
you
perceive
that
my
skin
is
becoming
softer
and
smoother
yes
and
fairer
too
he
replied
the
discolorations
are
disappearing
very
fast
what
does
it
mean
lina
it
means
that
aunt
meredith
was
wiser
than
the
new
york
doctors
she
laughed
she
has
prepared
a
salve
for
me
from
various
woodland
roots
and
herbs
that
is
slowly
obliterating
every
scar
and
discoloration
from
my
face
she
declares
that
in
a
year
i
shall
be
as
pretty
as
i
ever
was
then
i
shall
bless
the
kind
soul
forever
he
cried
out
joyfully
and
lina
knew
then
for
the
first
time
how
silently
and
sadly
ronald
had
sorrowed
for
the
loss
of
her
wondrous
beauty
it
was
two
years
later
when
the
two
were
traveling
that
they
met
walter
earle
he
had
attended
morning
service
at
a
pretty
english
church
and
he
heard
a
grand
glorious
triumphant
voice
rising
as
it
were
to
heaven
on
the
wings
of
the
in
he
looked
around
and
saw
ronald
valchester
sitting
by
his
wife
side
jaquelina
had
grown
more
beautiful
than
ever
every
trace
of
her
accident
had
disappeared
the
dark
eyes
were
radiant
with
youth
and
health
the
long
lashes
rested
on
a
cheek
the
scarlet
mouth
smiled
as
she
chanted
glory
be
to
god
on
high
and
on
earth
peace
good
will
to
men
walter
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
gave
one
sigh
deep
and
bitter
to
the
memory
of
what
he
had
lost
through
his
weakness
when
they
came
out
of
the
church
he
was
strong
enough
to
meet
them
and
speak
to
them
they
were
glad
and
surprised
in
a
breath
they
asked
him
if
he
was
married
yet
and
if
violet
was
with
him
no
i
am
not
married
yet
and
my
sister
is
dead
he
answered
sadly
and
then
he
showed
them
her
grave
it
was
right
in
the
churchyard
there
and
just
a
little
way
from
the
path
the
low
green
mound
was
covered
with
white
and
blue
violets
and
there
was
a
broken
marble
shaft
at
the
head
twined
about
with
passion
flowers
she
has
been
dead
six
months
he
said
tremulously
and
then
he
saw
the
husband
and
wife
look
at
each
other
with
a
shade
of
remorse
and
pain
in
their
speaking
eyes
she
had
quite
gotten
over
her
trouble
he
said
quickly
she
seemed
perfectly
well
and
happy
she
talked
of
you
ronald
and
you
valchester
kindly
and
often
but
she
inherited
her
mother
disease
she
died
very
suddenly
and
painlessly
one
evening
while
sitting
in
her
chair
and
watching
a
beautiful
sunset
jaquelina
shed
some
quiet
and
sorrowful
tears
over
violet
early
doom
they
were
the
first
tears
that
had
dimmed
her
lovely
eyes
since
she
had
married
ronald
valchester
he
made
her
very
happy
in
the
beautiful
calm
years
of
wedded
happiness
that
flowed
serenely
over
their
future
lives
the
few
years
of
passionate
sorrow
she
had
known
were
forgotten
wholly
or
remembered
only
as
a
haunting
