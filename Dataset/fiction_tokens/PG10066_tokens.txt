gunman
reckoning
the
fifty
empty
freights
danced
and
rolled
and
rattled
on
the
rough
road
bed
and
filled
jericho
pass
with
thunder
the
big
engine
was
laboring
and
grunting
at
the
grade
but
five
cars
back
the
noise
of
the
locomotive
was
lost
yet
there
is
a
way
to
talk
above
the
noise
of
a
freight
train
just
as
there
is
a
way
to
whistle
into
the
teeth
of
a
stiff
wind
this
talk
is
pitched
just
above
the
ordinary
tone
it
is
an
overtone
of
conversation
one
might
say
and
it
is
distinctly
nasal
the
brakie
could
talk
above
the
racket
and
so
of
course
could
lefty
joe
they
sat
about
in
the
center
of
the
train
on
the
forward
end
of
one
of
the
cars
no
matter
how
the
train
lurched
and
staggered
over
that
fearful
road
bed
these
two
swayed
in
their
places
as
easily
and
as
safely
as
birds
on
swinging
perches
the
brakie
had
touched
lefty
joe
for
two
dollars
he
had
secured
fifty
cents
and
since
the
vigor
of
lefty
oaths
had
convinced
him
that
this
was
all
the
money
the
tramp
had
the
two
now
sat
elbow
to
elbow
and
killed
the
distance
with
their
talk
it
like
old
times
to
have
you
here
said
the
brakie
you
used
to
play
this
line
when
you
jumped
from
coast
to
coast
sure
said
lefty
joe
and
he
scowled
at
the
mountains
on
either
side
of
the
pass
the
train
was
gathering
speed
and
the
peaks
lurched
eastward
in
a
confused
ragged
procession
and
a
durned
hard
ride
been
many
a
time
kind
of
queer
to
see
you
continued
the
brakie
heard
you
was
rising
in
the
world
he
caught
the
face
of
the
other
with
a
rapid
side
glance
but
lefty
joe
was
sufficiently
concealed
by
the
dark
heard
you
were
the
main
guy
with
a
whole
crowd
behind
you
went
on
the
brakie
yeh
sure
heard
you
was
riding
the
cushions
and
all
that
yeh
but
i
guess
it
was
all
bunk
here
you
are
back
again
anyway
yep
agreed
lefty
the
brakie
scratched
his
head
for
the
silence
of
the
tramp
convinced
him
that
there
had
been
after
all
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
the
rumor
he
ran
back
on
another
tack
and
slipped
about
lefty
i
never
laid
much
on
what
they
said
he
averred
i
know
you
lefty
you
can
do
a
lot
but
when
it
comes
to
leading
a
whole
gang
like
they
said
you
was
and
all
that
well
i
knew
it
was
a
lie
used
to
tell
that
you
talked
foolish
then
burst
out
lefty
suddenly
it
was
all
straight
the
brakie
could
hear
the
click
of
his
companion
teeth
at
the
period
to
this
statement
as
though
he
regretted
his
outburst
well
i
be
hanged
murmured
the
brakie
innocently
ordinarily
lefty
was
not
easily
lured
but
this
night
he
apparently
was
in
the
mood
for
talk
kennebec
lou
the
clipper
and
suds
them
and
a
lot
more
they
was
all
with
me
they
was
all
under
me
i
was
the
main
guy
what
a
ring
in
his
voice
as
he
said
it
the
beaten
general
speaks
thus
of
his
past
triumphs
the
old
man
remembered
his
youth
in
such
a
voice
the
brakie
was
impressed
he
repeated
the
three
names
even
suds
he
said
was
even
suds
with
you
even
suds
the
brakie
stirred
a
little
wabbling
from
side
to
side
as
he
found
a
more
comfortable
position
instead
of
looking
straight
before
him
he
kept
a
steadily
upon
his
companion
and
one
could
see
that
he
intended
to
remember
what
was
said
on
this
night
even
suds
echoed
the
brakie
good
heavens
and
ai
he
a
man
for
you
he
was
a
man
replied
lefty
joe
with
an
indescribable
emphasis
huh
he
ai
a
man
any
more
get
bumped
off
no
busted
the
brakie
considered
this
bit
of
news
and
rolled
it
back
and
forth
and
tried
its
flavor
against
his
gossiping
palate
did
you
fix
him
after
he
left
you
no
i
see
you
busted
him
while
he
was
still
with
you
then
kennebec
lou
and
the
clipper
get
sore
at
the
way
you
treat
suds
so
here
you
are
back
on
the
road
with
your
gang
all
gone
bust
hard
luck
lefty
but
lefty
whined
with
rage
at
this
careless
diagnosis
of
his
downfall
you
all
wrong
he
said
you
all
wrong
you
do
know
nothin
the
brakie
waited
grinning
securely
into
the
night
and
preparing
his
mind
for
the
story
but
the
story
consisted
of
one
word
flung
bitterly
into
the
rushing
air
donnegan
him
cried
the
brakie
starting
in
his
place
donnegan
cried
lefty
and
his
voice
made
the
word
into
a
curse
the
brakie
nodded
them
that
get
tangled
with
donnegan
do
last
long
you
ought
to
know
that
at
this
the
grief
hate
and
rage
in
lefty
joe
were
blended
and
caused
an
explosion
confound
donnegan
who
donnegan
i
ask
you
who
donnegan
a
guy
that
makes
trouble
replied
the
brakie
evidently
hard
put
to
it
to
find
a
definition
oh
do
he
make
it
though
confound
him
you
ought
to
of
stayed
shut
of
him
lefty
did
i
hunt
him
up
i
ask
you

nut

i
ai
do
i
go
along
stepping
on
the
tail
of
a
rattlesnake
no
more

i
look
up
donnegan
he
groaned
as
he
remembered
i
was
going
fine
nothing
could
of
been
better
i
had
the
boys
together
we
was
doing
so
well
that
i
was
riding
the
cushions
and
i
went
around
planning
the
jobs
nice
clean
work
no
cans
tied
to
it
but
one
day
i
had
to
meet
suds
down
in
the
meriton
jungle
you
know
i
heard
plenty
said
the
brakie
oh
it
ai
so
bad
the
meriton
i
seen
a
lot
worse
found
suds
there
and
suds
was
playing
black
jack
with
an
ol
gink
he
was
him
close
get
suds
going
good
and
he
could
read
three
down
and
bury
as
fast
as
they
came
under
the
bottom
card
takes
a
hand
to
do
that
sort
of
work
and
that
the
sort
of
work
suds
was
doing
for
the
old
man
pretty
soon
the
game
was
over
and
the
old
man
was
busted
he
took
up
his
pack
and
beat
it
saying
nothing
and
looking
sick
i
started
talking
to
suds
and
while
he
was
talking
along
comes
a
bo
and
gives
us
a
he
knew
me
this
here
a
friend
of
yours
lefty
he
says

i

dutch

that
old
dad
and
the
dad
is
one
of
donnegan
pals
wait
till
donnegan
hears
how
your
friend
made
the
cards
talk
while
he
was
skinning
the
old
boy
he
passes
me
the
wink
and
goes
on
made
me
sick
i
turned
to
suds
and
the
fool
had
batted
an
eye
never
even
heard
of
donnegan
you
know
how
it
is
half
the
road
never
heard
of
it
part
of
the
roads
do
know
nothin
else
he
like
a
jumpin
tornado
hits
every
ten
miles
and
bend
a
blade
of
grass
in
between
took
me
about
five
minutes
to
tell
suds
about
donnegan
then
suds
let
out
a
grunt
and
started
down
the
trail
for
the
old
dad
missed
him
dad
had
got
out
of
the
jungle
and
copped
a
rattler
suds
come
back
half
green
and
half
yeller
done
it
i
spilled
the
beans
he
says
ai
half
sayin
it
says
i
well
we
lit
out
after
that
and
beat
it
down
the
line
as
fast
as
we
could
we
got
the
rest
of
the
boys
together
i
had
a
swell
job
planned
up
everything
staked
then
the
first
news
come
that
donnegan
was
after
suds
news
just
dropped
on
us
out
of
the
sky
suds
you
know
how
he
is
strong
bluff
did
bat
an
eye
laughed
at
this
donnegan
got
a
hold
of
an
old
pal
of
his
named
levine
and
he
is
a
mighty
hot
scrapper
from
a
knife
to
a
toenail
they
was
nothing
that
levine
could
use
in
a
fight
suds
sent
him
out
to
cross
donnegan
trail
he
crossed
it
well
enough
suds
got
a
telegram
a
couple
days
later
saying
that
levine
had
run
into
a
wild
cat
and
was
considerable
chawed
and
would
suds
send
him
a
stake
to
pay
the
doctor
well
after
that
suds
got
sort
of
nervous
did
take
no
interest
in
his
work
no
more
kept
a
weather
eye
out
watching
for
the
coming
of
donnegan
and
pretty
soon
he
up
and
cleaned
out
of
camp
next
day
sure
enough
along
comes
donnegan
and
asks
for
suds
we
kept
still
all
but
kennebec
lou
kennebec
is
some
fighter
himself
two
hundred
pounds
of
mule
muscle
with
the
brain
of
a
devil
to
tell
what
to
do
yes
you
can
lay
it
ten
to
one
that
kennebec
is
some
fighter
that
day
he
had
a
good
edge
from
a
bottle
of
rye
he
was
trying
for
a
friend
he
did
need
to
go
far
to
find
trouble
in
donnegan
a
wink
and
a
grin
was
all
they
needed
for
a
password
and
then
they
went
at
each
throats
kennebec
made
the
first
pass
and
hit
thin
air
and
before
he
got
back
on
his
heels
donnegan
had
hit
him
four
times
then
kennebec
jumped
back
and
took
a
fresh
start
with
a
knife
here
lefty
joe
paused
and
sighed
he
continued
after
a
long
interval
five
minutes
later
we
was
all
busy
tyin
up
what
was
left
of
kennebec
donnegan
was
down
the
road
like
a
bird
and
that
was
the
end
of
my
gang
what
with
kennebec
lou
and
suds
both
gone
what
chance
did
i
have
to
hold
the
boys
together
the
brakie
heard
this
recital
with
the
keenest
interest
nodding
from
time
to
time
what
beats
me
lefty
he
said
at
the
end
of
the
story
is
why
you
did
knife
into
the
fight
yourself
and
take
a
hand
with
donnegan
at
this
lefty
was
silent
it
was
rather
the
silence
of
one
which
can
not
tell
whether
or
not
it
is
worth
while
to
speak
than
it
was
the
silence
of
one
who
needs
time
for
thought
i
tell
you
why
bo
it
because
when
i
take
a
trail
like
that
it
only
has
one
end
i
going
to
bump
off
the
other
bird
or
he
going
to
bump
off
me
the
brakie
cleared
his
throat
look
here
he
said
looks
to
me
like
a
queer
thing
that
you
on
this
train
does
it
queried
lefty
softly
why
because
donnegan
is
two
cars
back
asleep
the
devil
you
say
the
brakie
broke
into
laughter
do
kid
yourself
along
he
warned
do
do
it
it
wise
with
me
what
you
mean
come
on
lefty
come
clean
you
better
do
a
fade
off
this
train
why
you
fool
it
do
work
joe
why
the
minute
i
seen
you
i
knew
why
you
was
here
i
knew
you
meant
to
croak
donnegan
me
croak
him
why
should
i
croak
him
because
you
been
trailing
him
two
thousand
miles
because
you
ai
got
the
nerve
to
meet
him
face
to
face
and
you
got
to
sneak
in
and
take
a
crack
at
him
while
he
lying
asleep
that
you
lefty
joe
he
saw
lefty
sway
toward
him
but
all
stories
aside
it
is
a
very
bold
tramp
that
cares
for
argument
of
a
serious
nature
with
a
brakie
and
even
lefty
joe
was
deterred
from
violent
action
in
the
darkness
his
upper
lip
twitched
but
he
carefully
smoothed
his
voice
you
do
know
nothing
pal
he
declared
do
i
nothing
repeated
lefty
he
reached
into
his
clothes
and
produced
something
which
rustled
in
the
rush
of
wind
he
fumbled
and
finally
passed
a
scrap
of
the
paper
into
the
hand
of
the
brakie
my
heavens
drawled
the
latter
think
you
can
fix
me
with
a
buck
for
a
job
like
this
you
ca
bribe
me
to
stand
around
while
you
bump
off
donnegan
ca
be
done
lefty
one
buck
did
you
say
lefty
joe
expertly
lighted
a
match
in
spite
of
the
roaring
wind
and
by
this
wild
light
the
brakie
read
the
denomination
of
the
bill
with
a
gasp
he
rolled
up
his
face
and
was
in
time
to
catch
the
sneer
on
the
face
of
lefty
before
a
gust
snatched
away
the
light
of
the
match
they
had
topped
the
highest
point
in
jericho
pass
and
now
the
long
train
dropped
into
the
down
grade
with
terrific
speed
the
wind
became
a
hurricane
but
to
the
brakie
all
this
was
no
more
than
a
calm
night
his
thoughts
were
raging
in
him
and
if
he
looked
back
far
enough
he
remembered
the
dollar
which
donnegan
had
given
him
and
how
he
had
promised
donnegan
to
give
the
warning
before
anything
went
wrong
he
thought
of
this
but
rustling
against
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
was
the
bill
whose
denomination
he
had
read
and
that
figure
ate
into
his
memory
ate
into
his
brain
after
all
what
was
donnegan
to
him
what
was
donnegan
but
a
worthless
tramp
without
any
answer
to
that
last
monosyllabic
query
the
brakie
hunched
forward
and
began
to
work
his
way
up
the
train
the
tramp
watched
him
go
with
laughter
it
was
silent
laughter
in
the
most
quiet
room
it
would
not
have
sounded
louder
than
a
continual
light
hissing
noise
then
he
in
turn
moved
from
his
place
and
worked
his
way
along
the
train
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
the
brakie
had
disappeared
he
went
expertly
swinging
from
car
to
car
with
apelike
clumsiness
and
surety
two
cars
back
it
was
not
so
easy
to
reach
the
sliding
side
door
of
that
empty
car
considering
the
fact
that
it
was
night
that
the
train
was
bucking
furiously
over
the
old
roadbed
lefty
had
a
not
altogether
simple
task
before
him
but
he
managed
it
with
the
same
apelike
adroitness
he
could
climb
with
his
feet
as
well
as
his
hands
he
would
trust
a
ledge
as
well
as
he
would
trust
the
rung
of
a
ladder
under
his
discreet
manipulations
from
above
the
door
loosened
and
it
became
possible
to
work
it
back
but
even
this
the
tramp
did
with
considerable
care
he
took
advantage
of
the
lurching
of
the
train
and
every
time
the
car
jerked
he
forced
the
door
to
roll
a
little
so
that
it
might
seem
for
all
the
world
as
though
the
motion
of
the
train
alone
were
operating
it
for
suppose
that
donnegan
wakened
out
of
his
sound
sleep
and
observed
the
motion
of
the
door
he
would
be
suspicious
if
the
door
opened
in
a
single
continued
motion
but
if
it
worked
in
these
degrees
he
would
be
hypersuspicious
if
he
dreamed
of
danger
so
the
tramp
gave
five
whole
minutes
to
that
work
when
it
was
done
he
waited
for
a
time
another
five
minutes
perhaps
to
see
if
the
door
would
be
moved
back
and
when
it
was
not
disturbed
but
allowed
to
stand
open
he
knew
that
donnegan
still
slept
it
was
time
then
for
action
and
lefty
joe
prepared
for
the
descent
into
the
home
of
the
enemy
let
it
not
be
thought
that
he
approached
this
moment
with
a
fallen
heart
and
with
a
cringing
snaky
feeling
as
a
man
might
be
expected
to
feel
when
he
approached
to
murder
a
sleeping
foeman
for
that
was
not
lefty
emotion
at
all
rather
he
was
overcome
by
a
tremendous
happiness
he
could
have
sung
with
joy
at
the
thought
that
he
was
about
to
rid
himself
of
this
pest
true
the
gang
was
broken
up
but
it
might
rise
again
donnegan
had
fallen
upon
it
like
a
blight
but
with
donnegan
out
of
the
way
would
not
suds
come
back
to
him
instantly
and
would
not
kennebec
lou
himself
return
in
admiration
of
a
man
who
had
done
what
he
kennebec
could
not
do
with
those
two
as
a
nucleus
how
greatly
might
he
not
build
justice
must
be
done
to
lefty
joe
he
approached
this
murder
as
a
statesman
approaches
the
removal
of
a
foe
from
the
path
of
public
prosperity
there
was
no
more
rancor
in
his
attitude
it
was
rather
the
blissful
largeness
of
the
heart
that
comes
to
the
politician
when
he
unearths
the
scandal
which
will
blight
the
race
of
his
rival
with
the
peaceful
smile
of
a
child
therefore
lefty
joe
lay
stretched
at
full
length
along
the
top
of
the
car
and
made
his
choice
of
weapons
on
the
whole
his
usual
preference
day
or
night
was
for
a
revolver
give
him
a
gat
and
lefty
was
at
home
in
any
company
but
he
had
reasons
for
transferring
his
alliance
on
this
occasion
in
the
first
place
a
box
car
which
is
reeling
and
pitching
to
and
fro
from
side
to
side
is
not
a
very
good
shooting
platform
even
for
a
snapshot
like
lefty
joe
also
the
pitch
darkness
in
the
car
would
be
a
further
annoyance
to
good
aim
and
in
the
third
and
most
decisive
place
if
he
were
to
miss
his
first
shot
he
would
not
be
extremely
apt
to
place
his
second
bullet
for
donnegan
had
a
reputation
with
his
own
revolver
indeed
it
was
said
that
he
rarely
carried
the
weapon
because
when
he
did
he
was
always
tempted
too
strongly
to
use
it
so
that
the
chances
were
large
that
donnegan
would
not
have
the
gun
now
yet
if
he
did
have
it
if
he
lefty
did
miss
his
first
shot
then
the
story
would
be
brief
and
bitter
indeed
on
the
other
hand
a
knife
offered
advantages
almost
too
numerous
to
be
listed
it
gave
one
the
deadly
assurance
which
only
comes
with
the
knowledge
of
an
edge
of
steel
in
one
hand
and
when
the
knife
reaches
its
mark
it
ends
a
battle
at
a
stroke
of
course
these
doubts
and
considerations
pro
and
con
went
through
the
mind
of
the
tramp
in
about
the
same
space
of
time
that
it
requires
for
a
dog
to
waken
snap
at
a
fly
and
drowse
again
eventually
he
took
out
his
knife
it
was
a
sheath
knife
which
he
wore
from
a
noose
of
silk
around
his
throat
and
it
always
lay
closest
to
his
heart
the
blade
of
the
knife
was
of
the
finest
spanish
steel
in
the
days
when
spanish
smiths
knew
how
to
draw
out
steel
to
a
streak
of
light
the
handle
of
the
knife
was
from
milan
on
the
whole
it
was
a
delicate
and
beautiful
weapon
and
it
had
the
durable
suppleness
of
say
hatred
itself
lefty
joe
like
a
pirate
in
a
tale
took
this
weapon
between
his
teeth
allowed
his
squat
heavy
bulk
to
swing
down
and
dangle
at
arm
length
for
an
instant
and
then
he
swung
himself
a
little
and
landed
softly
on
the
floor
of
the
car
who
has
not
heard
snow
drop
from
the
branch
upon
other
snow
beneath
that
was
the
way
lefty
joe
dropped
to
the
floor
of
the
car
he
remained
as
he
had
fallen
crouched
alert
with
one
hand
spread
out
on
the
boards
to
balance
him
and
give
him
a
leverage
and
a
start
in
case
he
should
wish
to
spring
in
any
direction
then
he
began
to
probe
the
darkness
in
every
direction
with
every
glance
he
allowed
his
head
to
dart
out
a
little
the
movement
was
like
a
chicken
pecking
at
imaginary
grains
of
corn
but
eventually
he
satisfied
himself
that
his
quarry
lay
in
the
forward
end
of
the
car
that
he
was
prone
that
he
lefty
had
accomplished
of
his
purpose
by
entering
the
place
of
his
enemy
unobserved
but
even
though
this
major
step
was
accomplished
successfully
lefty
joe
was
not
the
man
to
abandon
caution
in
the
midst
of
an
enterprise
the
roar
of
the
train
would
have
covered
sounds
ten
times
as
loud
as
those
of
his
snaky
approach
yet
he
glided
forward
with
as
much
care
as
though
he
were
stepping
on
old
stairs
in
a
silent
house
he
could
see
a
vague
shadow
donnegan
but
chiefly
he
worked
by
that
peculiar
sense
of
direction
which
some
people
possess
in
a
dim
light
the
blind
of
course
have
that
sense
in
a
high
degree
of
sensitiveness
but
even
those
who
are
not
blind
may
learn
to
trust
the
peculiar
and
inverted
sense
of
direction
with
this
to
aid
him
lefty
joe
went
steadily
slowly
across
the
first
and
most
dangerous
stage
of
his
journey
that
is
he
got
away
from
the
square
of
the
open
door
where
the
faint
starlight
might
vaguely
serve
to
silhouette
his
body
after
this
it
was
easier
work
of
course
when
he
alighted
on
the
floor
of
the
car
the
knife
had
been
transferred
from
his
teeth
to
his
left
hand
and
all
during
his
progress
forward
the
knife
was
being
balanced
delicately
as
though
he
were
not
yet
quite
sure
of
the
weight
of
the
weapon
just
as
a
prize
fighter
keeps
his
deadly
poised
hands
in
play
moving
them
as
though
he
fears
to
lose
his
intimate
touch
with
them
this
stalking
had
occupied
a
matter
of
split
seconds
now
lefty
joe
rose
slowly
he
was
leaning
very
far
forward
and
he
warded
against
the
roll
of
the
car
by
spreading
out
his
right
hand
close
to
the
floor
his
left
hand
he
poised
with
the
knife
and
he
began
to
gather
his
muscles
for
the
leap
he
had
already
taken
the
last
preliminary
movement
he
had
swung
himself
to
the
right
side
a
little
and
lightening
his
left
foot
had
thrown
all
his
weight
upon
the
right
in
fact
his
body
was
literally
suspended
in
the
instant
of
springing
catlike
when
the
shadow
which
was
donnegan
came
to
life
the
shadow
convulsed
as
shadows
are
apt
to
swirl
in
a
green
pool
when
a
stone
is
dropped
into
it
and
a
bit
of
board
two
feet
long
and
some
eight
inches
wide
cracked
against
the
shins
of
lefty
joe
it
was
about
the
least
dramatic
weapon
that
could
have
been
chosen
under
those
circumstances
but
certainly
no
other
defense
could
have
frustrated
lefty
spring
so
completely
instead
of
launching
out
in
a
compact
mass
whose
point
of
contact
was
the
reaching
knife
lefty
crawled
stupidly
forward
upon
his
knees
and
had
to
throw
out
his
knife
hand
to
save
his
balance
it
is
a
singular
thing
to
note
how
important
balance
is
to
men
animals
fight
as
a
rule
just
as
well
on
their
backs
as
they
do
on
their
feet
they
can
lie
on
their
sides
and
bite
they
can
swing
their
claws
even
while
they
are
dropping
through
the
air
but
man
needs
poise
and
balance
before
he
can
act
what
is
speed
in
a
fighter
it
is
not
so
much
an
affair
of
the
muscles
as
it
is
the
power
of
the
brain
to
adapt
itself
instantly
to
each
new
move
and
put
the
body
in
a
state
of
balance
in
the
prize
ring
speed
does
not
mean
the
ability
to
strike
one
lightning
blow
but
rather
that
having
finished
one
drive
the
fighter
is
in
position
to
hit
again
and
then
again
so
that
no
matter
where
the
impetus
of
his
last
lunge
has
placed
him
he
is
ready
and
poised
to
shoot
all
his
weight
behind
his
fist
again
and
drive
it
accurately
at
a
vulnerable
spot
individually
the
actions
may
be
slow
but
the
series
of
efforts
seem
rapid
that
is
why
a
superior
boxer
seems
to
hypnotize
his
antagonist
with
movements
which
to
the
spectator
seem
perfectly
easy
slow
and
sure
but
if
lefty
lacked
much
in
agility
he
had
an
animallike
sense
of
balance
sprawling
helpless
he
saw
the
convulsed
shadow
that
was
donnegan
take
form
as
a
straight
shooting
body
that
plunged
through
the
air
above
him
lefty
joe
dug
his
left
elbow
into
the
floor
of
the
car
and
whirled
back
upon
his
shoulders
bunching
his
knees
high
over
his
stomach
nine
chances
out
of
ten
if
donnegan
had
fallen
flatwise
upon
this
alert
enemy
he
would
have
received
those
knees
in
the
pit
of
his
own
stomach
and
instantly
been
paralyzed
but
in
the
jumping
rattling
car
even
donnegan
was
capable
of
making
mistakes
his
mistake
in
this
instance
saved
his
life
for
springing
too
far
he
came
down
not
in
reaching
distance
of
lefty
throat
but
with
his
chest
on
the
knees
of
the
older
tramp
as
a
result
donnegan
was
promptly
kicked
head
over
heels
and
tumbled
the
length
of
the
car
lefty
was
on
his
feet
and
plunging
after
the
tumbling
form
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
literally
speaking
and
he
was
only
kept
from
burying
his
knife
in
the
flesh
of
his
foe
by
a
sway
of
the
car
that
staggered
him
in
the
act
of
striking
donnegan
the
next
instant
was
beyond
reach
he
had
struck
the
end
of
the
car
and
rebounded
like
a
ball
of
rubber
at
a
tangent
he
slid
into
the
shadows
and
lefty
putting
his
own
shoulders
to
the
wall
felt
for
his
revolver
and
knew
that
he
was
lost
he
had
failed
in
his
first
surprise
attack
and
without
surprise
to
help
him
now
he
was
gone
he
weighed
his
revolver
decided
that
it
would
be
madness
to
use
it
for
if
he
missed
donnegan
would
instantly
be
guided
by
the
flash
to
shoot
him
full
of
holes
something
slipped
by
the
open
door
something
that
glimmered
faintly
and
lefty
joe
knew
that
it
was
the
red
head
of
donnegan
donnegan
as
a
shadow
among
shadows
donnegan
on
a
blood
trail
it
lowered
the
heartbeat
of
lefty
joe
to
a
tremendous
slow
pulse
in
that
moment
he
gave
up
hope
and
resigning
himself
to
die
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
gasp
as
became
one
of
his
reputation
and
national
celebrity
on
the
road
yet
lefty
joe
was
no
common
man
and
no
common
fighter
no
let
the
shade
of
rusty
dick
whom
lefty
met
and
beat
in
his
glorious
prime
let
this
shade
arise
and
speak
for
the
prowess
of
lefty
joe
in
fact
it
was
because
he
was
such
a
good
fighter
himself
that
he
recognized
his
helplessness
in
the
hands
of
donnegan
the
faint
glimmer
of
color
had
passed
the
door
it
was
dissolved
in
deeper
shadows
at
once
and
soundlessly
lefty
knew
that
donnegan
was
closer
and
closer
of
one
thing
he
felt
more
and
more
confident
that
donnegan
did
not
have
his
revolver
with
him
otherwise
he
would
have
used
it
before
for
what
was
darkness
to
this
devil
donnegan
he
walked
like
a
cat
and
most
likely
he
could
see
like
a
cat
in
the
dark
instinctively
the
older
tramp
braced
himself
with
his
right
hand
held
at
a
guard
before
his
breast
and
the
knife
poised
in
his
left
just
as
a
man
would
prepare
to
meet
the
attack
of
a
panther
he
even
took
to
probing
the
darkness
in
a
strange
hope
to
catch
the
glimmer
of
the
eyes
of
donnegan
as
he
moved
to
the
attack
if
there
were
a
hair
breadth
of
light
then
donnegan
himself
must
go
down
a
single
blow
would
do
it
but
the
devil
had
instructed
his
favorite
donnegan
how
to
fight
he
did
not
come
lunging
through
the
shadows
to
meet
the
point
of
that
knife
instead
he
had
worked
a
snaky
way
along
the
floor
and
now
he
leaped
in
and
up
at
lefty
taking
him
under
the
arms
a
dozen
hands
it
seemed
laid
hold
on
lefty
he
fought
like
a
demon
and
tore
himself
away
but
the
multitude
of
hands
pursued
him
they
were
small
hands
where
they
closed
they
tore
the
clothes
and
bit
into
his
very
flesh
once
a
hand
had
him
by
the
throat
and
when
lefty
jerked
himself
away
it
was
with
a
feeling
that
his
flesh
had
been
seared
by
five
points
of
iron
all
this
time
his
knife
was
darting
once
it
ripped
through
cloth
but
never
once
did
it
find
the
target
and
half
a
second
later
donnegan
got
his
hold
the
flash
of
the
knife
as
lefty
raised
it
must
have
guided
the
other
he
shot
his
right
hand
up
behind
the
left
shoulder
of
the
other
and
imprisoned
the
wrist
not
only
did
it
make
the
knife
hand
helpless
but
by
bearing
down
with
his
own
weight
donnegan
could
put
his
enemy
in
most
exquisite
torture
for
an
instant
they
whirled
then
they
went
down
and
lefty
was
on
top
only
for
a
moment
the
impetus
which
had
sent
him
to
the
floor
was
used
by
donnegan
to
turn
them
over
and
once
fairly
on
top
his
left
hand
was
instantly
at
the
throat
of
lefty
twice
lefty
made
enormous
efforts
but
then
he
was
done
about
his
body
the
limbs
of
donnegan
were
twisted
tightening
with
incredible
force
just
as
hot
iron
bands
sink
resistlessly
into
place
the
cut
away
life
at
its
source
once
he
strove
to
bury
his
teeth
in
the
arm
of
donnegan
once
as
the
horror
caught
at
him
he
strove
to
shriek
for
help
all
he
succeeded
in
doing
was
in
raising
an
awful
sobbing
whisper
then
looking
death
in
the
face
lefty
plunged
into
the
great
darkness
when
he
wakened
he
jumped
at
a
stride
into
the
full
possession
of
his
faculties
he
had
been
placed
near
the
open
door
and
the
rush
of
night
air
had
done
its
work
in
reviving
him
but
lefty
drawn
back
to
life
felt
only
a
vague
wonder
that
his
life
had
not
been
taken
perhaps
he
was
being
reserved
by
the
victor
for
an
indian
death
of
torment
he
felt
cautiously
and
found
that
not
only
were
his
hands
free
but
his
revolver
had
not
been
taken
from
him
a
familiar
weight
was
on
his
chest
the
very
knife
had
been
returned
to
its
sheath
had
donnegan
returned
these
things
to
show
how
perfectly
he
despised
his
enemy
he
gone
groaned
the
tramp
sitting
up
quickly
he
here
said
a
voice
that
cut
easily
through
the
roar
of
the
train
waiting
for
you
lefty
the
tramp
was
staggered
again
but
then
who
had
ever
been
able
to
fathom
the
ways
of
donnegan
donnegan
he
cried
with
a
sudden
recklessness
yes
you
a
fool
yes
for
not
finishing
the
job
donnegan
began
to
laugh
in
the
uproar
of
the
train
it
was
impossible
really
to
hear
the
sound
but
lefty
caught
the
pulse
of
it
he
fingered
his
bruised
throat
swallowing
was
a
painful
effort
and
an
indescribable
feeling
came
over
him
as
he
realized
that
he
sat
armed
to
the
teeth
within
a
yard
of
the
man
he
wanted
to
kill
and
yet
he
was
as
effectively
rendered
helpless
as
though
iron
shackles
had
been
locked
on
his
wrists
and
legs
the
night
light
came
through
the
doorway
and
he
could
make
out
the
slender
outline
of
donnegan
and
again
he
caught
the
faint
luster
of
that
red
hair
and
out
of
the
shadowy
form
a
singular
power
emanated
and
sapped
his
strength
at
the
root
yet
he
went
on
viciously
sooner
or
later
donnegan
i
get
you
the
red
head
of
donnegan
moved
and
lefty
joe
knew
that
the
younger
man
was
laughing
again
why
are
you
after
me
he
asked
at
length
it
was
another
blow
in
the
face
of
lefty
he
sat
for
a
time
blinking
with
owlish
stupidity
why
he
echoed
and
he
spoke
his
astonishment
from
the
heart
why
am
i
after
you
he
said
again
why
confound
you
ai
you
donnegan
yes
do
the
whole
road
know
that
i
after
you
and
you
after
me
the
whole
road
is
crazy
i
not
after
you
lefty
choked
maybe
i
been
dreaming
maybe
you
did
bust
up
the
gang
maybe
you
did
clean
up
on
suds
and
kennebec
suds
kennebec
i
sort
of
remember
meeting
them
you
sort
of
the
devil
lefty
joe
sputtered
the
words
and
after
you
cleaned
up
my
crowd
ai
it
natural
and
good
sense
for
you
to
go
on
and
try
to
clean
up
on
me
sounds
like
it
but
i
figured
to
beat
you
to
it
i
cut
in
on
your
trail
donnegan
and
before
i
leave
it
you
know
a
lot
more
about
me
you
warning
me
ahead
of
time
you
played
this
game
square
with
me
i
play
square
with
you
next
time
there
be
no
slips
donnegan
i
dunno
why
you
should
of
picked
on
me
though
just
the
natural
devil
in
you
i
have
picked
on
you
said
donnegan
what
i
give
you
my
word
a
tingle
ran
through
the
blood
of
lefty
joe
somewhere
he
had
heard
in
rumor
that
the
word
of
donnegan
was
as
good
as
gold
he
recalled
that
rumor
now
and
something
of
dignity
in
the
manner
with
which
donnegan
made
his
announcement
carried
a
heavy
weight
as
a
rule
the
tramps
vowed
with
many
oaths
here
was
one
of
the
nights
of
the
road
who
made
his
bare
word
sufficient
and
lefty
joe
heard
with
great
wonder
all
i
ask
he
said
is
why
you
hounded
my
gang
if
you
was
after
me
i
did
hound
them
i
ran
into
suds
by
accident
we
had
trouble
then
levine
then
kennebec
lou
tried
to
take
a
fall
out
of
me
a
note
of
whimsical
protest
crept
into
the
voice
of
donnegan
somehow
there
always
a
fight
wherever
i
go
he
said
fights
just
sort
of
grow
up
around
me
lefty
joe
snarled
you
did
mean
nothing
by
just
to
run
into
three
of
my
boys
one
after
another
not
a
thing
lefty
rocked
himself
back
and
forth
in
an
ecstasy
of
impatience
why
do
you
stay
put
he
complained
why
do
you
stake
out
your
own
ground
and
stay
put
in
it
you
cut
in
on
every
guy
territory
there
ai
any
privacy
any
more
since
you
hit
the
road
what
you
got
a
roving
commission
donnegan
waited
for
a
moment
before
he
answered
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
had
altered
indeed
he
had
remarkable
ability
to
pitch
his
voice
into
the
roar
of
the
freight
train
and
above
or
beneath
it
and
give
it
a
quality
such
as
he
pleased
i
following
a
trail
but
not
yours
he
admitted
at
length
following
a
trail
i
been
at
it
these
two
years
and
nothing
has
come
of
it
who
you
after
a
man
with
red
hair
that
tells
me
a
lot
donnegan
refused
to
explain
what
you
got
against
him
the
color
of
his
hair
and
lefty
roared
contentedly
at
his
own
stale
jest
it
no
good
replied
donnegan
i
never
get
on
the
trail
lefty
broke
in
you
mean
to
say
you
been
working
two
solid
years
and
all
on
a
trail
that
you
ai
even
found
the
silence
answered
him
in
the
affirmative
ai
nobody
been
able
to
tip
you
off
to
him
went
on
lefty
intensely
interested
nobody
you
see
he
a
hard
sort
to
describe
red
hair
that
all
there
was
about
him
for
a
clue
but
if
any
one
ever
saw
him
stripped
they
remember
him
by
a
big
blotchy
birthmark
on
his
left
shoulder
eh
grunted
lefty
joe
he
added
what
was
his
name
do
know
he
changed
monikers
when
he
took
to
the
road
what
was
he
to
you
a
man
i
going
to
find
no
matter
where
the
trail
takes
you
no
matter
where
at
this
lefty
was
seized
with
unaccountable
laughter
he
literally
strained
his
lungs
with
that
homeric
outburst
when
he
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
at
length
the
shadow
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
doorway
had
disappeared
he
found
his
companion
leaning
over
him
and
this
time
he
could
catch
the
dull
glint
of
starlight
on
both
hair
and
eyes
what
know
asked
donnegan
how
do
you
stand
toward
this
bird
with
the
birthmark
and
the
red
hair
queried
lefty
with
caution
what
know
insisted
donnegan
all
at
once
passion
shook
him
he
fastened
his
grip
in
the
shoulder
of
the
larger
man
and
his
fingertips
worked
toward
the
bone
what
do
you
know
he
repeated
for
the
third
time
and
now
there
was
no
hint
of
laughter
in
the
hard
voice
of
lefty
you
fool
if
you
follow
that
trail
you
go
to
the
devil
it
was
rusty
dick
and
he
dead
his
triumphant
laughter
came
again
but
donnegan
cut
into
it
rusty
dick
was
the
one
you
killed
sure
what
of
it
we
fought
fair
and
square
then
rusty
was
the
man
i
want
the
man
i
want
would
of
eaten
two
like
you
lefty
what
about
the
birthmark
it
sure
was
on
his
shoulder
donnegan
heavens
whispered
donnegan
what
the
matter
rusty
dick
gasped
donnegan
yes
it
must
have
been
he
sure
it
was
what
did
you
have
against
him
it
was
a
matter
of
blood
between
us
stammered
donnegan
his
voice
rose
in
a
peculiar
manner
so
that
lefty
shrank
involuntarily
you
killed
rusty
ask
any
of
the
boys
but
between
you
and
me
it
was
the
booze
that
licked
rusty
dick
i
just
finished
up
the
job
and
surprised
everybody
the
train
was
out
of
the
mountains
and
in
a
country
of
scattering
hills
but
here
it
struck
a
steep
grade
and
settled
down
to
a
grind
of
slow
labor
the
rails
hummed
and
suspense
filled
the
freight
car
hey
cried
lefty
suddenly
you
fool
you
do
a
flop
out
the
door
in
about
a
minute
he
even
reached
out
to
steady
the
toppling
figure
but
donnegan
pitched
straight
out
into
the
night
lefty
craned
his
neck
from
the
door
studying
the
roadbed
but
at
that
moment
the
locomotive
topped
the
little
rise
and
the
whole
train
lurched
forward
after
all
murmured
lefty
joe
it
sounds
like
donnegan
hated
a
guy
so
bad
that
he
had
any
use
for
livin
when
he
heard
the
other
guy
was
dead
but
i
never
goin
to
cross
his
path
again
i
hope
but
donnegan
had
leaped
clear
of
the
roadbed
and
he
struck
almost
to
the
knees
in
a
drift
of
sand
otherwise
he
might
well
have
broken
his
legs
with
that
foolhardy
chance
as
it
was
the
fall
whirled
him
over
and
over
and
by
the
time
he
had
picked
himself
up
the
lighted
caboose
of
the
train
was
rocking
past
him
donnegan
watched
it
grow
small
in
the
distance
and
then
when
it
was
only
a
red
uncertain
star
far
down
the
track
he
turned
to
the
vast
country
around
him
the
mountains
were
to
his
right
not
far
away
but
caught
up
behind
the
shadows
so
that
it
seemed
a
great
distance
like
all
huge
things
they
seemed
in
motion
toward
him
for
the
rest
he
was
in
bare
rolling
country
the
sky
line
everywhere
was
clean
there
was
hardly
a
sign
of
a
tree
he
knew
by
a
little
reflection
that
this
must
be
cattle
country
for
the
brakie
had
intimated
as
much
in
their
talk
just
before
dusk
now
it
was
early
night
and
a
wind
began
to
rise
blowing
down
the
valley
with
a
keen
motion
and
a
rapidly
lessening
temperature
so
that
donnegan
saw
he
must
get
to
a
shelter
he
could
if
necessary
endure
any
privation
but
his
tastes
were
for
luxurious
comfort
accordingly
he
considered
the
landscape
with
gloomy
disapproval
he
was
almost
inclined
to
regret
his
plunge
from
the
lumbering
freight
train
two
things
had
governed
him
in
making
that
move
first
when
he
discovered
that
the
long
trail
he
followed
was
definitely
fruitless
he
was
filled
with
a
great
desire
to
cut
himself
away
from
his
past
and
make
a
new
start
secondly
when
he
learned
that
rusty
dick
had
been
killed
by
joe
he
wanted
desperately
to
get
the
throttle
of
the
latter
under
his
thumb
if
ever
a
man
risked
his
life
to
avoid
a
sin
it
was
donnegan
jumping
from
the
train
to
keep
from
murder
he
stooped
to
sight
along
the
ground
for
this
is
the
best
way
at
night
and
often
horizon
lights
are
revealed
in
this
manner
but
now
donnegan
saw
nothing
to
serve
as
a
guide
he
therefore
drew
in
his
belt
until
it
fitted
snug
about
his
gaunt
waist
settled
his
cap
firmly
and
headed
straight
into
the
wind
nothing
could
have
shown
his
character
more
distinctly
when
in
doubt
head
into
the
wind
with
a
jaunty
swinging
step
he
sauntered
along
and
this
time
at
least
his
tactics
found
an
early
reward
topping
the
first
large
rise
of
ground
he
saw
in
the
hollow
beneath
him
the
outline
of
a
large
building
and
as
he
approached
it
the
wind
clearing
a
high
blowing
mist
from
the
stars
he
saw
a
jumble
of
outlying
houses
sheds
barns
corrals
it
was
the
nucleus
of
a
big
ranch
it
is
a
maxim
that
if
you
wish
to
know
a
man
look
at
his
library
and
if
you
wish
to
know
a
rancher
look
at
his
barn
donnegan
made
a
small
detour
to
the
left
and
headed
for
the
largest
of
the
barns
he
entered
it
by
the
big
sliding
door
which
stood
open
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
stars
shining
through
a
gap
in
the
roof
and
then
he
stood
quietly
for
a
time
listening
to
the
voices
of
the
wind
in
the
ruin
oddly
enough
it
was
pleasant
to
donnegan
his
own
troubles
and
sorrow
had
poured
upon
him
so
thickly
in
the
past
hour
or
so
that
it
was
soothing
to
find
evidence
of
the
distress
of
others
but
perhaps
this
meant
that
the
entire
establishment
was
deserted
he
left
the
barn
and
went
toward
the
house
not
until
he
was
close
under
its
wall
did
he
come
to
appreciate
its
size
it
was
one
of
those
great
rambling
structures
which
the
cattle
kings
of
the
past
generation
were
fond
of
building
standing
close
to
it
he
heard
none
of
the
intimate
sounds
of
the
storm
blowing
through
cracks
and
broken
walls
no
matter
into
what
disrepair
the
barns
had
fallen
the
house
was
still
solid
only
about
the
edges
of
the
building
the
storm
kept
murmuring
yet
there
was
not
a
light
neither
above
nor
below
he
came
to
the
front
of
the
house
still
no
sign
of
life
he
stood
at
the
door
and
knocked
loudly
upon
it
and
though
when
he
tried
the
knob
he
found
that
the
door
was
latched
yet
no
one
came
in
response
he
knocked
again
and
putting
his
ear
close
he
heard
the
echoes
walk
through
the
interior
of
the
building
after
this
the
wind
rose
in
sudden
strength
and
deafened
him
with
rattlings
above
him
a
shutter
was
swung
open
and
then
crashed
to
so
that
the
opening
of
the
door
was
a
shock
of
surprise
to
donnegan
a
dim
light
from
a
source
which
he
could
not
direct
suffused
the
interior
of
the
hall
the
door
itself
was
worked
open
a
matter
of
inches
and
donnegan
was
aware
of
two
keen
old
eyes
glittering
out
at
him
beyond
this
he
could
distinguish
nothing
who
are
you
asked
a
woman
voice
and
what
do
you
want
i
a
stranger
and
i
want
something
to
eat
and
a
place
to
sleep
this
house
looks
as
if
it
might
have
spare
rooms
where
come
from
yonder
said
donnegan
with
a
sufficiently
noncommittal
gesture
what
your
name
donnegan
i
do
know
you
be
off
with
you
mr
donnegan
he
inserted
his
foot
in
the
closing
crack
of
the
door
tell
me
where
i
to
go
he
persisted
at
this
her
voice
rose
in
pitch
with
squeaky
rage
i
raise
the
house
on
you
raise
call
down
the
man
of
the
house
i
can
talk
to
him
better
than
i
can
to
you
but
i
wo
walk
off
like
this
if
you
can
feed
me
i
pay
you
for
what
i
eat
a
shrill
cackling
he
could
not
make
out
the
words
and
since
patience
was
not
the
first
of
donnegan
virtues
he
seized
on
the
knob
of
the
door
and
deliberately
pressed
it
wide
standing
in
the
hall
now
and
closing
the
door
slowly
behind
him
he
saw
a
woman
with
old
keen
eyes
shrinking
away
toward
the
staircase
she
was
evidently
in
great
fear
but
there
was
something
infinitely
malicious
in
the
manner
in
which
she
kept
working
her
lips
soundlessly
she
was
shrinking
and
half
turned
away
yet
there
was
a
suggestion
that
in
an
instant
she
might
whirl
and
fly
at
his
face
the
door
now
clicked
and
with
the
windstorm
shut
away
donnegan
had
a
queer
feeling
of
being
trapped
now
call
the
man
of
the
house
he
repeated
see
if
i
ca
come
to
terms
with
him
he
make
short
work
of
you
if
he
came
she
replied
she
broke
into
a
shrill
laughter
and
donnegan
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
face
so
ugly
if
he
came
she
said
you
rue
the
day
well
i
talk
to
you
then
i
not
asking
charity
i
want
to
pay
for
what
i
get
this
ai
a
hotel
you
go
on
down
the
road
inside
eight
miles
come
to
the
town
eight
miles
that
nothing
for
a
man
to
ride
not
at
all
if
i
had
something
to
ride
you
ai
got
a
horse
no
then
how
do
you
come
here
i
walked
if
this
sharpened
her
suspicions
it
sharpened
her
fear
also
she
put
one
foot
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
stairs
be
off
with
you
donnegally
or
whatever
your
outlandish
name
is
you
get
nothing
here
what
brings
you
a
door
closed
and
a
footstep
sounded
lightly
on
the
floor
above
and
donnegan
already
alert
in
the
strange
atmosphere
of
this
house
gave
back
a
pace
so
as
to
get
an
honest
wall
behind
him
he
noted
that
the
step
was
quick
and
small
and
preparing
himself
to
meet
a
wisp
of
manhood
which
for
that
matter
was
the
type
he
was
most
inclined
to
fear
donnegan
kept
a
corner
glance
upon
the
old
woman
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
steadily
surveyed
the
shadows
at
the
head
of
the
rise
out
of
that
darkness
a
foot
slipped
not
even
a
boy
foot
a
very
child
the
shock
of
it
made
donnegan
relax
his
caution
for
an
instant
and
in
that
instant
she
came
into
the
reach
of
the
light
it
was
a
wretched
light
at
best
for
it
came
from
a
lamp
with
smoky
chimney
which
the
old
hag
carried
and
at
the
raising
and
lowering
of
her
hand
the
flame
jumped
and
died
in
the
throat
of
the
chimney
and
set
the
hall
awash
with
shadows
falling
away
to
a
point
of
yellow
the
lamp
allowed
the
hall
to
assume
a
certain
indefinite
dignity
of
height
and
breadth
and
calm
proportions
but
when
the
flame
rose
donnegan
could
see
the
broken
balusters
of
the
balustrade
the
carpet
faded
past
any
design
and
worn
to
rattiness
wall
paper
which
had
rotted
or
dried
away
and
hung
in
crisp
tatters
here
and
there
and
on
the
ceiling
an
irregular
patch
from
which
the
plaster
had
fallen
and
exposed
the
lathwork
but
at
the
coming
of
the
girl
the
old
woman
had
turned
and
as
she
did
the
flame
tossed
up
in
the
lamp
and
donnegan
could
see
the
newcomer
distinctly
once
before
his
heart
had
risen
as
it
rose
now
it
had
been
the
fag
end
of
a
long
party
and
donnegan
rousing
from
a
drunken
sleep
staggered
to
the
window
leaning
there
to
get
the
freshness
of
the
night
air
against
his
hot
face
he
had
looked
up
and
saw
the
white
face
of
the
moon
going
up
the
sky
and
a
sudden
sense
of
the
blackness
and
loathing
against
the
city
had
come
upon
donnegan
and
the
murky
color
of
his
own
life
and
when
he
turned
away
from
the
window
he
was
sober
and
so
it
was
that
he
now
stared
up
at
the
girl
at
her
breast
she
held
a
cloak
together
with
one
hand
and
the
other
hand
touched
the
railing
of
the
stairs
he
saw
one
foot
suspended
for
the
next
step
as
though
the
sight
of
him
kept
her
back
in
fear
to
the
miserable
soul
of
donnegan
she
seemed
all
that
was
lovely
young
and
pure
and
her
hair
old
gold
in
the
shadow
and
pale
gold
where
the
lamp
struck
it
was
to
donnegan
like
a
miraculous
light
about
her
face
indeed
that
little
pause
was
a
great
and
awful
moment
for
considering
that
donnegan
who
had
gone
through
his
whole
life
with
his
eyes
ready
either
to
mock
or
hate
and
who
had
rarely
used
his
hand
except
to
make
a
fist
of
it
donnegan
who
had
never
so
far
as
is
known
had
a
companion
who
had
asked
the
world
for
action
not
kindness
this
donnegan
now
stood
straight
with
his
back
against
the
wall
and
poured
out
the
story
of
his
wayward
life
to
a
mere
slip
of
a
girl
even
the
old
woman
whose
eyes
were
sharpened
by
her
habit
of
looking
constantly
for
the
weaknesses
and
vices
of
men
could
not
guess
what
was
going
on
behind
the
thin
rather
ugly
face
of
donnegan
the
girl
perhaps
may
have
seen
more
for
she
caught
the
glitter
of
his
active
eyes
even
at
that
distance
the
hag
began
to
explain
with
vicious
gestures
that
set
the
light
flaring
up
and
down
he
ai
come
from
nowhere
lou
she
said
he
ai
going
nowhere
he
wants
to
stay
here
for
the
night
the
foot
which
had
been
suspended
to
take
the
next
step
was
now
withdrawn
donnegan
remembered
at
last
whipped
off
his
cap
and
at
once
the
light
flared
and
burned
upon
his
hair
it
was
a
wonderful
red
it
shone
and
it
had
a
terrible
blood
tinge
so
that
his
face
seemed
pale
beneath
it
there
were
three
things
that
made
up
the
peculiar
dominance
of
donnegan
countenance
the
three
things
were
the
hair
the
uneasy
bright
eyes
and
the
rather
thin
compressed
lips
when
donnegan
slept
he
seemed
about
to
waken
from
a
vigorous
dream
when
he
sat
down
he
seemed
about
to
leap
to
his
feet
and
when
he
was
standing
he
gave
that
impression
of
a
poise
which
is
ready
for
anything
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
girl
seeing
that
face
and
that
alert
aggressive
body
shrank
a
little
on
the
stairs
donnegan
that
instant
knew
that
these
two
women
were
really
alone
in
the
house
as
far
as
fighting
men
were
concerned
and
the
fact
disturbed
him
more
than
a
leveled
gun
would
have
done
he
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
even
past
the
old
woman
and
raising
his
head
he
spoke
to
the
girl
my
name
donnegan
i
came
over
from
the
railroad
walked
i
do
want
to
walk
that
other
eight
miles
unless
there
a
real
need
for
it
i
why
did
he
pause
i
pay
for
anything
i
get
here
his
voice
was
not
too
certain
behind
his
teeth
there
was
knocking
a
desire
to
cry
out
to
her
the
truth
i
am
donnegan
donnegan
the
tramp
donnegan
the
shiftless
donnegan
the
fighter
donnegan
the
killer
donnegan
the
penniless
worthless
but
for
heaven
sake
let
me
stay
until
morning
and
let
me
look
at
you
from
a
distance
but
after
all
perhaps
he
did
not
need
to
say
all
these
things
his
clothes
were
rags
upon
his
face
there
was
a
stubble
of
unshaven
red
which
made
the
pallor
about
his
eyes
more
pronounced
if
the
girl
had
been
half
blind
she
must
have
felt
that
here
was
a
man
of
fire
he
saw
her
gather
the
wrap
a
little
closer
about
her
shoulders
and
that
sign
of
fear
made
him
sick
at
heart
donnegan
said
the
girl
i
am
sorry
we
can
not
take
you
into
the
house
eight
miles
did
she
expect
to
turn
a
sinner
from
the
gates
of
heaven
with
a
mere
phrase
he
cast
out
his
hand
and
she
winced
as
though
he
had
shaken
his
fist
at
her
are
you
afraid
cried
donnegan
i
do
control
the
house
he
paused
not
that
her
reply
had
baffled
him
but
the
mere
pleasure
of
hearing
her
speak
accounted
for
it
it
was
one
of
those
low
light
voices
which
are
apt
to
have
very
little
range
or
volume
and
which
break
and
tremble
absurdly
under
any
stress
of
emotion
and
often
they
become
shrill
in
a
higher
register
but
inside
conversational
limits
if
such
a
term
may
be
used
there
is
no
fiber
so
delightful
so
purely
musical
suppose
the
word
velvet
applied
to
a
sound
that
voice
came
soothingly
and
delightfully
upon
the
ear
of
donnegan
from
which
the
roar
and
rattle
of
the
empty
freight
train
had
not
quite
departed
he
smiled
at
her
but
he
protested
this
is
west
of
the
rockies
and
i
do
see
any
other
way
out
the
girl
all
this
time
was
studying
him
intently
a
little
sadly
he
thought
now
she
shook
her
head
but
there
was
more
warmth
in
her
voice
i
sorry
i
ca
ask
you
to
stay
without
first
consulting
my
father
go
ahead
ask
him
she
raised
her
hand
a
little
the
thought
seemed
to
bring
her
to
the
verge
of
trembling
as
though
he
were
asking
a
sacrilege
why
not
he
urged
she
did
not
answer
but
instead
her
eyes
sought
the
old
woman
as
if
to
gain
her
interposition
she
burst
instantly
into
speech
which
there
no
good
talking
any
more
declared
the
ancient
vixen
are
you
wanting
to
make
trouble
for
her
with
the
colonel
be
off
young
man
it
ai
the
first
time
i
told
you
you
get
nowhere
in
this
house
there
was
no
possible
answer
left
to
donnegan
and
he
did
as
usual
the
surprising
thing
he
broke
into
laughter
of
such
clear
and
ringing
tone
such
infectious
laughter
that
the
old
woman
blinked
in
the
midst
of
her
wrath
as
though
she
were
seeing
a
new
man
and
he
saw
the
lips
of
the
girl
parted
in
wonder
my
father
is
an
invalid
said
the
girl
and
he
lives
by
strict
rules
i
could
not
break
in
on
him
at
this
time
of
the
evening
if
that
all
donnegan
actually
began
to
mount
the
steps
i
go
in
and
talk
to
your
father
myself
she
had
retired
one
pace
as
he
began
advancing
but
as
the
import
of
what
he
said
became
clear
to
her
she
was
rooted
to
one
position
by
astonishment
colonel
macon
my
father
she
began
then
do
you
really
wish
to
see
him
the
hushed
voice
made
donnegan
smile
it
was
such
a
voice
as
one
boy
uses
when
he
asks
the
other
if
he
really
dares
enter
the
pasture
of
the
red
bull
he
chuckled
again
and
this
time
she
smiled
and
her
eyes
were
widened
partly
by
fear
of
his
purpose
and
partly
from
his
nearness
they
seemed
to
be
suddenly
closer
together
as
though
they
were
on
one
side
against
a
common
enemy
and
that
enemy
was
her
father
the
old
woman
was
cackling
sharply
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
then
bobbing
in
pursuit
and
calling
on
donnegan
to
come
back
at
length
the
girl
raised
her
hand
and
silenced
her
with
a
gesture
donnegan
was
now
hardly
a
pace
away
and
he
saw
that
she
lived
up
to
all
the
promise
of
that
first
glance
yet
still
she
seemed
unreal
there
is
a
quality
of
the
unearthly
about
a
girl
beauty
it
is
after
all
only
a
gay
moment
between
the
formlessness
of
childhood
and
the
hardness
of
middle
age
this
girl
was
pale
donnegan
saw
and
yet
she
had
color
she
had
the
luster
say
of
a
white
rose
and
the
same
bloom
lou
the
old
woman
had
called
her
and
macon
was
her
father
name
lou
macon
the
name
fitted
her
donnegan
thought
for
that
matter
if
her
name
had
been
sally
smith
donnegan
would
probably
have
thought
it
beautiful
the
keener
a
man
mind
is
and
the
more
he
knows
about
men
and
women
and
the
ways
of
the
world
the
more
apt
he
is
to
be
intoxicated
by
a
touch
of
grace
and
thoughtfulness
and
all
these
seconds
the
perfume
of
girlhood
had
been
striking
up
to
donnegan
brain
she
brushed
her
timidity
away
and
with
the
same
gesture
accepted
donnegan
as
something
more
than
a
dangerous
vagrant
she
took
the
lamp
from
the
hands
of
the
crone
and
sent
her
about
her
business
disregarding
the
mutterings
and
the
warnings
which
trailed
behind
the
departing
form
now
she
faced
donnegan
screening
the
light
from
her
eyes
with
a
cupped
hand
and
by
the
same
device
focusing
it
upon
the
face
of
donnegan
he
mutely
noted
the
small
maneuver
and
gave
her
credit
but
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
white
of
her
fingers
and
the
way
they
tapered
to
a
pink
transparency
at
the
tips
he
forgot
the
poor
figure
he
must
make
with
his
soiled
ragged
shirt
his
unshaven
face
his
gaunt
cheeks
indeed
he
looked
so
straight
at
her
that
in
spite
of
her
advantage
with
the
light
she
had
to
avoid
his
glance
i
am
sorry
said
lou
macon
and
ashamed
because
we
ca
take
you
in
the
only
house
on
the
range
where
you
would
be
welcome
i
know
but
my
father
leads
a
very
close
life
he
has
set
ways
the
ways
of
an
invalid
mr
donnegan
and
you
bothered
about
speaking
to
him
of
me
i
almost
afraid
of
letting
you
go
in
yourself
let
me
take
the
risk
she
considered
him
again
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
with
a
nod
and
he
followed
her
up
the
stairs
into
the
upper
hall
the
moment
they
stepped
into
it
he
heard
her
clothes
flutter
and
a
small
gale
poured
on
them
it
was
criminal
to
allow
such
a
building
to
fall
into
this
ruinous
condition
and
a
gloomy
picture
rose
in
donnegan
mind
of
the
invalid
lying
in
his
bed
listening
to
the
storm
and
silently
gathering
bitterness
out
of
the
pain
of
living
lou
macon
paused
again
in
the
hall
close
to
a
door
on
the
right
i
going
to
send
you
in
to
speak
to
my
father
she
said
gravely
first
i
have
to
tell
you
that
he
different
donnegan
replied
by
looking
straight
at
her
and
this
time
she
did
not
wince
from
the
glance
indeed
she
seemed
to
be
probing
him
searching
with
a
peculiar
hope
what
could
she
expect
to
find
in
him
what
that
was
useful
to
her
not
once
in
all
his
life
had
such
a
sense
of
impotence
descended
upon
donnegan
her
father
bah
invalid
or
no
invalid
he
would
handle
that
fellow
and
if
the
old
man
had
an
acrid
temper
donnegan
at
will
could
file
his
own
speech
to
a
point
but
the
girl
in
the
meager
hand
which
held
the
lamp
there
was
a
power
which
all
the
muscles
of
donnegan
could
not
compass
and
in
his
weakness
he
looked
wistfully
at
her
i
hope
your
talk
will
be
pleasant
i
hope
so
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
and
withdrew
it
hastily
then
summoning
great
resolution
she
opened
the
door
and
showed
donnegan
in
father
she
said
this
is
donnegan
he
wishes
to
speak
to
you
the
door
closed
behind
donnegan
and
hearing
that
whishing
sound
which
the
door
of
a
heavy
safe
will
make
he
looked
down
at
this
and
saw
that
it
was
actually
inches
thick
once
more
the
sense
of
being
in
a
trap
descended
upon
him
he
found
himself
in
a
large
room
which
before
he
could
examine
a
single
feature
of
it
was
effectively
curtained
from
his
sight
straight
into
his
face
shot
a
current
of
violent
white
light
that
made
him
blink
there
was
the
natural
recoil
but
in
donnegan
recoils
were
generally
protected
by
several
strata
of
willpower
and
seldom
showed
in
any
physical
action
on
the
present
occasion
his
first
dismay
was
swiftly
overwhelmed
by
a
cold
anger
at
the
insulting
trick
this
was
not
the
trick
of
a
helpless
invalid
donnegan
could
not
see
a
single
thing
before
him
but
he
obeyed
a
very
deep
instinct
and
advanced
straight
into
the
current
of
light
he
was
glad
to
see
the
light
switched
away
the
comparative
darkness
washed
across
his
eyes
in
a
pleasant
wave
and
he
was
now
able
to
distinguish
a
few
things
in
the
room
it
was
as
he
had
first
surmised
quite
large
the
ceiling
was
high
the
proportions
comfortably
spacious
but
what
astounded
donnegan
was
the
real
elegance
of
the
furnishings
there
was
no
mistaking
the
deep
silken
texture
of
the
rug
upon
which
he
stepped
the
glow
of
light
barely
reached
the
wall
and
there
showed
faintly
in
streaks
along
yellowish
hangings
beside
a
table
which
supported
a
big
reading
lamp
gasoline
no
doubt
from
the
intensity
of
its
light
sat
colonel
macon
with
a
large
volume
spread
across
his
knees
donnegan
saw
two
highlights
fine
silver
hair
that
covered
the
head
of
the
invalid
and
a
pair
of
white
hands
fallen
idly
upon
the
surface
of
the
big
book
for
if
the
silver
hair
suggested
age
the
smoothly
finished
hands
suggested
perennial
youth
they
were
strong
carefully
tended
complacent
hands
they
suggested
to
donnegan
a
man
sufficient
unto
himself
donnegan
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
rise
to
receive
you
now
what
pleasant
accident
has
brought
me
the
favor
of
this
call
donnegan
was
taken
aback
again
and
this
time
more
strongly
than
by
the
flare
of
light
against
his
eyes
for
in
the
voice
he
recognized
the
quality
of
the
girl
the
same
softness
the
same
velvety
richness
though
the
pitch
was
a
bass
in
the
voice
of
this
man
there
was
the
same
suggestion
that
the
tone
would
crack
if
it
were
forced
either
up
or
down
with
this
great
difference
one
could
hardly
conceive
of
a
situation
which
would
push
that
man
voice
beyond
its
monotone
it
flowed
with
deadly
softness
it
clung
about
one
it
fascinated
and
baffled
the
mind
of
the
listener
but
donnegan
was
not
in
the
habit
of
being
baffled
by
voices
neither
was
he
a
lover
of
formality
he
looked
about
for
a
place
to
sit
down
and
immediately
discovered
that
while
the
invalid
sat
in
an
enormous
bordered
by
shelves
and
supplied
with
wheels
for
raising
and
lowering
the
back
and
for
propelling
the
chair
about
the
room
on
its
rubber
tires
it
was
the
only
chair
in
the
room
which
could
make
any
pretensions
toward
comfort
as
a
matter
of
fact
aside
from
this
one
immense
chair
devoted
to
the
pleasure
of
the
invalid
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
for
his
visitors
to
sit
upon
except
two
or
three
miserable
backless
stools
but
donnegan
was
not
long
taken
aback
he
tucked
his
cap
under
his
arm
bowed
profoundly
in
honor
of
the
colonel
compliments
and
brought
one
of
the
stools
to
a
place
where
it
was
no
nearer
the
rather
ominous
circle
of
the
lamplight
than
was
the
invalid
himself
with
his
eyes
accustomed
to
the
new
light
donnegan
could
now
take
better
stock
of
his
host
he
saw
a
rather
handsome
face
with
eyes
exceedingly
blue
young
and
active
but
the
features
of
macon
as
well
as
his
body
were
blurred
and
obscured
by
a
great
fatness
he
was
truly
a
prodigious
man
and
one
could
understand
the
stoutness
with
which
the
invalid
chair
was
made
his
great
wrist
dimpled
like
the
wrist
of
a
healthy
baby
and
his
face
was
so
enlarged
with
superfluous
flesh
that
the
lower
part
of
it
quite
dwarfed
the
upper
he
seemed
at
first
glance
a
man
with
a
low
forehead
and
bright
careless
eyes
and
a
body
made
immobile
by
flesh
and
sickness
a
man
whose
spirits
despised
and
defied
pain
yet
a
second
glance
showed
that
the
forehead
was
after
all
a
nobly
proportioned
one
and
for
all
the
bulk
of
that
figure
for
all
the
donnegan
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
the
bulk
spring
lightly
out
of
the
chair
to
meet
him
for
his
own
part
sitting
back
on
the
stool
with
his
cap
tucked
under
his
arm
and
his
hands
folded
about
one
knee
he
met
the
faint
cold
smile
of
the
colonel
with
a
broad
grin
of
his
own
i
can
put
it
in
a
nutshell
said
donnegan
i
was
tired
dead
beat
needed
a
handout
and
rapped
at
your
door
along
comes
a
mystery
in
the
shape
of
an
woman
and
opens
the
door
to
me
tries
to
shut
me
out
i
decided
to
come
in
she
insists
on
keeping
me
outside
all
at
once
i
see
that
i
have
to
get
into
the
house
i
am
brought
in
your
daughter
tries
to
steer
me
off
sees
that
the
job
is
more
than
she
can
get
away
with
and
shelves
me
off
upon
you
and
that
colonel
macon
is
the
pleasant
accident
which
brings
you
the
favor
of
this
call
it
would
have
been
a
speech
both
stupid
and
pert
in
the
mouth
of
another
but
donnegan
knew
how
to
flavor
words
with
a
touch
of
mockery
of
himself
as
well
as
another
there
were
two
manners
in
which
this
speech
could
have
been
received
with
a
wink
or
with
a
smile
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
hear
it
and
grow
frigid
as
for
the
colonel
he
smiled
it
was
a
tricky
smile
however
as
donnegan
felt
it
spread
easily
upon
that
vast
face
and
again
went
out
and
left
all
to
the
dominion
of
the
cold
bright
eyes
a
case
of
curiosity
commented
the
colonel
a
case
of
hunger
said
donnegan
my
dear
donnegan
put
it
that
way
if
you
wish
and
a
case
of
blankets
needed
for
one
night
really
have
you
ventured
into
such
a
country
as
this
without
any
equipment
outside
of
my
purse
my
equipment
is
of
the
invisible
kind
wits
suggested
the
colonel
thank
you
not
at
all
you
hinted
at
it
yourself
however
a
hint
is
harder
to
take
than
to
make
the
colonel
raised
his
faultless
right
hand
and
oddly
enough
his
great
corpulence
did
not
extend
in
the
slightest
degree
to
his
hand
but
stopped
short
at
the
wrists
and
stroked
his
immense
chin
his
skin
was
like
lou
macon
except
that
in
place
of
the
bloom
his
was
a
parchment
dead
pallor
he
lowered
his
hand
with
the
same
slow
precision
and
folded
it
with
the
other
all
the
time
probing
donnegan
with
his
difficult
eyes
unfortunately
most
unfortunately
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
accommodate
you
mr
donnegan
the
reply
was
not
flippant
but
quick
not
at
all
i
am
the
easiest
person
in
the
world
to
accommodate
the
big
man
smiled
sadly
my
fortune
has
fallen
upon
evil
days
sir
it
is
no
longer
what
it
was
there
are
in
this
house
three
habitable
rooms
this
one
my
apartment
the
kitchen
where
old
haggie
sleeps
otherwise
you
are
in
a
rat
trap
of
a
place
he
shook
his
head
a
slow
decisive
motion
a
spare
blanket
said
donnegan
will
be
enough
there
was
another
sigh
and
another
shake
of
the
head
even
a
corner
of
a
rug
to
roll
up
in
will
do
perfectly
you
see
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
entertain
you
bare
boards
will
do
well
enough
for
me
colonel
macon
and
if
i
have
a
piece
of
bread
a
plate
of
cold
beans
anything
i
can
entertain
myself
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
so
compliant
donnegan
because
that
makes
my
refusal
seem
the
more
unkind
but
i
can
not
have
you
sleeping
on
the
bare
floor
not
on
such
a
night
pneumonia
comes
on
one
like
a
cat
in
the
dark
in
such
weather
it
is
really
impossible
to
keep
you
here
sir
said
donnegan
he
began
to
feel
that
he
was
stumped
and
it
was
a
most
unusual
feeling
for
him
besides
for
a
young
fellow
like
you
with
your
agility
what
is
eight
miles
walk
down
the
road
and
you
will
come
to
a
place
where
you
will
be
made
at
home
and
fed
like
a
king
eight
miles
that
not
much
but
on
such
a
night
as
this
there
was
a
faint
glint
in
the
eyes
of
the
colonel
was
he
not
sharpening
his
wits
for
his
contest
of
words
and
enjoying
it
the
wind
will
be
at
your
back
and
buoy
your
steps
it
will
shorten
the
eight
miles
to
four
very
definitely
donnegan
felt
that
the
other
was
reading
him
what
was
it
that
he
saw
as
he
turned
the
pages
there
is
one
thing
you
fail
to
take
into
your
accounting
ah
i
have
an
irresistible
aversion
to
walking
ah
repeated
macon
or
exercise
in
any
form
then
you
are
unfortunate
to
be
in
this
country
without
a
horse
unfortunate
perhaps
but
the
fact
is
that
i
here
very
sorry
to
trouble
you
though
colonel
i
am
rarely
troubled
said
the
colonel
coldly
and
since
i
have
no
means
of
accommodation
the
laws
of
hospitality
rest
light
on
my
shoulders
yet
i
have
an
odd
thought
replied
donnegan
well
you
have
expressed
a
number
already
it
seems
to
me
it
this
that
you
already
made
up
your
mind
to
keep
me
here
the
colonel
stiffened
in
his
chair
and
under
his
bulk
even
those
ponderous
timbers
quaked
a
little
once
more
donnegan
gained
an
impression
of
chained
activity
ready
to
rise
to
any
emergency
the
colonel
jaw
set
and
the
last
vestige
of
the
smile
left
his
eyes
yet
it
was
not
anger
that
showed
in
its
place
instead
it
was
rather
a
hungry
searching
he
looked
keenly
into
the
face
and
the
soul
of
donnegan
as
a
searchlight
sweeps
over
waters
by
night
you
are
a
mind
reader
mr
donnegan
no
more
of
a
mind
reader
than
a
chinaman
is
ah
they
are
great
readers
of
mind
my
friend
donnegan
grinned
and
at
this
the
colonel
frowned
a
great
and
mysterious
people
sir
i
keep
evidences
of
them
always
about
me
look
he
swept
the
shaft
of
the
reading
light
up
and
it
fell
upon
a
red
vase
against
the
yellow
hangings
even
donnegan
inexperienced
eye
read
a
price
into
that
shimmering
vase
queer
color
he
said
dusty
claret
ah
they
have
the
only
names
for
their
colors
think
peach
bloom
liquid
dawn
ripe
cherry
oil
green
green
of
powdered
tea
blue
of
the
sky
after
rain
what
names
for
color
what
other
land
possesses
such
a
tongue
that
goes
straight
to
the
heart
the
colonel
waved
his
faultless
hands
and
then
dropped
them
back
upon
the
book
with
the
tenderness
of
a
benediction
and
their
terms
for
texture
pear
rind
lime
peel
millet
seed
do
not
scoff
at
china
donnegan
she
is
the
fairy
godmother
and
we
are
the
poor
children
he
changed
the
direction
of
the
light
donnegan
watched
him
fascinated
but
what
convinced
you
that
i
wished
to
keep
you
here
to
amuse
you
colonel
macon
the
colonel
exposed
gleaming
white
teeth
and
laughed
in
that
soft
voice
amuse
me
for
fifteen
years
i
have
sat
in
this
room
and
amused
myself
by
taking
in
what
i
would
and
shutting
out
the
rest
of
the
world
i
have
made
the
walls
thick
and
padded
them
to
keep
out
all
sound
you
observe
that
there
is
no
evidence
here
of
the
storm
that
is
going
on
tonight
amuse
me
indeed
and
donnegan
thought
of
lou
macon
in
her
old
drab
dress
huddling
the
poor
cloak
around
her
shoulders
to
keep
out
the
cold
while
her
father
lounged
here
in
luxury
he
could
gladly
have
buried
his
lean
fingers
in
that
fat
throat
from
the
first
he
had
had
an
aversion
to
this
man
very
well
i
shall
go
it
has
been
a
pleasant
chat
colonel
very
pleasant
and
thank
you
but
before
you
go
taste
this
whisky
it
will
help
you
when
you
enter
the
wind
he
opened
a
cabinet
in
the
side
of
the
chair
and
brought
out
a
black
bottle
and
a
pair
of
glasses
and
put
them
on
the
broad
arm
of
the
chair
donnegan
sauntered
back
you
see
he
murmured
you
will
not
let
me
go
at
this
the
colonel
raised
his
head
suddenly
and
glared
into
the
eyes
of
his
guest
and
yet
so
perfect
was
his
muscular
and
nerve
control
that
he
did
not
interrupt
the
thin
stream
of
amber
which
trickled
into
one
of
the
glasses
looking
down
again
he
finished
pouring
the
drinks
they
pledged
each
other
with
a
motion
and
drank
it
was
very
old
very
oily
and
donnegan
smiled
as
he
put
down
the
empty
glass
sit
down
said
the
colonel
in
a
new
voice
donnegan
obeyed
fate
went
on
the
colonel
rules
our
lives
we
give
our
honest
endeavors
but
the
deciding
touch
is
the
hand
of
fate
he
garnished
this
absurd
truism
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
so
solemn
that
donnegan
was
chilled
as
though
the
fat
man
were
actually
conversant
with
the
three
sisters
fate
has
brought
you
to
me
therefore
i
intend
to
keep
you
here
in
my
service
i
am
about
to
place
a
great
mission
and
a
great
trust
in
your
hands
in
the
hands
of
a
man
you
know
nothing
about
i
know
you
as
if
i
had
raised
you
donnegan
smiled
and
shaking
his
head
the
red
hair
flashed
and
shimmered
as
long
as
there
is
no
work
attached
to
the
mission
it
may
be
agreeable
to
me
but
there
is
work
then
the
contract
is
broken
before
it
is
made
you
are
rash
but
i
had
rather
begin
with
a
dissent
and
then
work
upward
donnegan
waited
to
balance
against
work
excuse
me
nothing
balances
against
work
for
me
to
balance
against
work
continued
the
colonel
raising
a
white
hand
and
by
that
gesture
crushing
the
protest
of
donnegan
there
is
a
great
reward
colonel
macon
i
have
never
worked
for
money
before
and
i
shall
not
work
for
it
now
you
trouble
me
with
interruptions
who
mentioned
money
you
shall
not
have
a
penny
no
the
reward
shall
grow
out
of
the
work
and
the
work
is
fighting
at
this
donnegan
narrowed
his
eyes
and
searched
the
fat
man
thoroughly
it
sounded
like
the
talk
of
a
charlatan
and
yet
there
was
a
crispness
to
these
sentences
that
made
him
suspect
something
underneath
for
that
matter
in
certain
districts
his
name
and
his
career
were
known
he
had
never
dreamed
that
that
reputation
could
have
come
within
a
thousand
miles
of
this
part
of
the
mountain
desert
you
should
have
told
me
in
the
first
place
he
said
with
some
anger
that
you
knew
me
donnegan
upon
my
honor
i
never
heard
your
name
before
my
daughter
uttered
it
donnegan
waited
soberly
i
despise
charlatanry
as
much
as
the
next
man
you
shall
see
the
steps
by
which
i
judged
you
when
you
entered
the
room
i
threw
a
strong
light
upon
you
you
did
not
blanch
you
immediately
walked
straight
into
the
shaft
of
light
although
you
could
not
see
a
foot
before
you
and
that
proved
a
combative
instinct
and
coolness
not
the
sort
of
brute
vindictiveness
that
fights
for
a
rage
for
a
love
of
conflict
is
that
clear
donnegan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
above
all
i
need
a
fighter
then
i
watched
your
eyes
and
your
hands
the
first
were
direct
and
yet
they
were
alert
and
your
hands
were
perfectly
steady
qualifications
for
a
fighter
eh
do
you
wish
further
proof
well
what
of
the
fight
to
the
death
which
you
went
through
this
same
night
donnegan
started
it
was
a
small
movement
that
flinching
and
he
covered
it
by
continuing
the
upward
gesture
of
his
hand
to
his
coat
he
drew
out
tobacco
and
cigarette
papers
and
commenced
to
roll
his
smoke
looking
up
he
saw
that
the
eyes
of
colonel
macon
were
smiling
although
his
face
was
grave
a
glint
of
understanding
passed
between
the
two
men
but
not
a
spoken
word
i
assure
you
there
was
no
death
tonight
said
donnegan
at
length
tush
of
course
not
but
the
tear
on
the
shoulder
of
your
coat
ah
that
is
too
smooth
edged
for
a
tear
too
long
for
the
bite
of
a
scissors
am
i
right
tush
not
a
word
the
colonel
beamed
with
an
almost
tender
pride
and
donnegan
knowing
that
the
fat
man
looked
upon
him
as
a
murderer
newly
come
from
a
death
considered
the
beaming
face
and
thought
many
things
in
silence
so
it
was
easy
to
see
that
in
coolness
courage
fighting
instinct
skill
you
were
probably
what
i
want
yet
something
more
than
all
these
qualifications
is
necessary
for
the
task
which
lies
ahead
of
you
you
pile
up
the
bad
features
eh
to
entice
you
donnegan
for
one
man
paint
a
rosy
beginning
and
once
under
way
he
will
manage
the
hard
parts
for
you
show
you
the
hard
shell
and
you
will
trust
it
contains
the
choice
flesh
i
was
saying
that
i
waited
to
see
other
qualities
in
you
qualities
of
the
judgment
and
suddenly
you
flashed
upon
me
a
single
glance
i
felt
it
clash
against
my
willpower
i
felt
your
look
go
past
my
guard
like
a
rapier
slipping
around
my
blade
i
colonel
macon
was
for
the
first
time
outfaced
i
admit
it
for
i
rejoice
in
meeting
such
a
man
and
the
next
instant
you
told
me
that
i
should
keep
you
here
out
of
my
own
wish
admirable
the
admiration
of
the
colonel
indeed
almost
overwhelmed
donnegan
but
he
saw
that
in
spite
of
the
genial
smile
the
face
suffused
with
warmth
the
colonel
was
watching
him
every
instant
donnegan
did
as
he
had
done
on
the
stairs
he
burst
into
laughter
when
he
had
done
the
colonel
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
with
his
fingers
interlacing
examining
his
guest
from
beneath
somber
brows
as
he
sat
lurched
forward
he
gave
a
terrible
impression
of
that
reserved
energy
which
donnegan
had
sensed
before
donnegan
said
the
colonel
i
shall
talk
no
more
nonsense
to
you
you
are
a
terrible
fellow
and
donnegan
knew
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
colonel
life
he
was
meeting
another
man
upon
equal
ground
in
a
way
it
was
an
awful
tribute
for
one
great
fact
grew
upon
him
that
the
colonel
represented
almost
perfectly
the
power
of
absolute
evil
donnegan
was
not
a
squeamish
sort
but
the
fat
smiling
face
of
macon
filled
him
with
unutterable
aversion
a
dozen
times
he
would
have
left
the
room
but
a
silken
thread
held
him
back
the
thought
of
lou
i
shall
be
terse
and
entirely
frank
said
the
colonel
and
at
once
donnegan
reared
triple
guard
and
balanced
himself
for
attack
or
defense
between
you
and
me
went
on
the
fat
man
deceptive
words
are
folly
a
waste
of
energy
he
flushed
a
little
you
are
i
believe
the
first
man
who
has
ever
laughed
at
me
the
click
of
his
teeth
as
he
snapped
them
on
this
sentence
seemed
to
promise
that
he
should
also
be
the
last
so
i
tear
away
the
veils
which
made
me
ridiculous
i
grant
you
donnegan
we
have
met
each
other
just
in
time
true
said
donnegan
you
have
a
task
for
me
that
promises
a
lot
of
fighting
and
in
return
i
get
lodgings
for
the
night
wrong
wrong
i
offer
you
much
more
i
offer
you
a
career
of
action
in
which
you
may
forget
the
great
sorrow
which
has
fallen
upon
you
and
in
the
battles
which
lie
before
you
you
will
find
oblivion
for
the
sad
past
which
lies
behind
you
here
donnegan
sprang
to
his
feet
with
his
hand
caught
at
his
breast
and
he
stood
quivering
in
an
agony
pain
worked
him
as
anger
would
do
and
his
slender
frame
swelling
his
muscles
taut
he
stood
like
a
panther
enduring
the
torture
because
knows
it
is
folly
to
attempt
to
escape
you
are
a
human
devil
donnegan
said
at
last
and
sank
back
upon
his
stool
for
a
moment
he
was
overcome
his
head
falling
upon
his
breast
and
even
when
he
looked
up
his
face
was
terribly
pale
and
his
eyes
dull
his
expression
however
cleared
swiftly
and
aside
from
the
perspiration
which
shone
on
his
forehead
it
would
have
been
impossible
ten
seconds
later
to
discover
that
the
blow
of
the
colonel
had
fallen
upon
him
all
of
this
the
colonel
had
observed
and
noted
with
grim
satisfaction
not
once
did
he
speak
until
he
saw
that
all
was
well
i
am
sorry
he
said
at
length
in
a
voice
almost
as
delicate
as
the
voice
of
lou
macon
i
am
sorry
but
you
forced
me
to
say
more
than
i
wished
to
say
donnegan
brushed
the
apology
aside
his
voice
became
low
and
hurried
let
us
get
on
in
the
matter
i
am
eager
to
learn
from
you
colonel
very
well
since
it
seems
that
there
is
a
place
for
both
our
interests
in
this
matter
i
shall
run
on
in
my
tale
and
make
it
as
i
promised
you
before
absolutely
frank
and
curt
i
shall
not
descend
into
small
details
i
shall
give
you
a
main
sketch
of
the
high
points
for
all
men
of
mind
are
apt
to
be
confused
by
the
face
of
a
thing
whereas
the
heart
of
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
them
he
settled
into
his
narrative
you
have
heard
of
the
corner
no
well
that
is
not
strange
but
a
few
weeks
ago
gold
was
found
in
the
sands
where
the
valleys
of
young
muddy
and
christobel
rivers
join
the
corner
is
a
long
wide
triangle
of
sand
and
the
sand
is
filled
with
a
gold
deposit
brought
down
from
the
headwaters
of
both
rivers
and
precipitated
here
where
one
current
meets
the
other
and
reduces
the
resultant
stream
to
sluggishness
the
sands
are
rich
very
rich
he
had
become
a
trifle
flushed
as
he
talked
and
now
perhaps
to
cover
his
emotion
he
carefully
selected
a
cigarette
from
the
humidor
beside
him
and
lighted
it
without
haste
before
he
spoke
another
word
long
ago
i
prospected
over
that
valley
a
few
weeks
ago
it
was
brought
to
my
attention
again
i
determined
to
stake
some
claims
and
work
them
but
i
could
not
go
myself
i
had
to
send
a
trustworthy
man
whom
should
i
select
there
was
only
one
possible
jack
landis
is
my
ward
a
dozen
years
ago
his
parents
died
and
they
sent
him
to
my
care
for
my
fortune
was
then
comfortable
i
raised
him
with
as
much
tenderness
as
i
could
have
shown
my
own
son
i
lavished
on
him
the
affection
and
here
donnegan
coughed
lightly
the
fat
man
paused
and
observing
that
this
hypocrisy
did
not
draw
the
veil
over
the
bright
eyes
of
his
guest
he
continued
in
a
word
i
made
him
one
of
my
family
and
when
the
need
for
a
man
came
i
turned
to
him
he
is
young
strong
active
able
to
take
care
of
himself
at
this
donnegan
pricked
his
ears
he
went
accordingly
to
the
corner
and
staked
the
claims
and
filed
them
as
i
directed
i
was
right
there
was
gold
much
gold
it
panned
out
in
nuggets
he
made
an
indescribable
gesture
and
through
his
strong
fingers
donnegan
had
a
vision
of
yellow
gold
pouring
but
there
is
seldom
a
discovery
of
importance
claimed
by
one
man
alone
this
was
no
exception
a
villain
named
william
lester
known
as
a
scoundrel
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
cattle
country
claimed
that
he
had
made
the
discovery
first
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
claim
that
i
had
obtained
my
information
from
him
and
he
tried
to
jump
the
claims
staked
by
jack
landis
whereupon
jack
very
properly
shot
lester
down
not
dead
unfortunately
but
slightly
wounded
in
the
meantime
the
rush
for
the
corner
started
in
a
week
there
was
a
village
in
a
fortnight
there
was
a
town
in
a
month
the
corner
had
become
the
talk
of
the
ranges
jack
landis
found
in
the
claims
a
mint
he
sent
me
back
a
mere
souvenir
the
fat
man
produced
from
his
vest
pocket
a
little
chunk
of
yellow
and
with
a
dexterous
motion
whipped
it
at
donnegan
it
was
done
so
suddenly
so
unexpectedly
that
the
wanderer
was
taken
by
surprise
but
his
hand
flashed
up
and
caught
the
metal
before
it
struck
his
face
he
found
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
a
nugget
weighing
perhaps
five
ounces
and
he
flicked
it
back
to
the
colonel
he
sent
me
the
souvenir
but
that
was
all
since
that
time
i
have
waited
nothing
has
come
i
sent
for
word
and
i
learned
that
jack
landis
had
betrayed
his
trust
fallen
in
love
with
some
undesirable
woman
of
the
mining
camp
denied
my
claim
to
any
of
the
gold
to
which
i
had
sent
him
unpleasant
news
yes
ungrateful
boy
yes
but
my
mind
is
hardened
against
adversity
yet
this
blow
struck
me
close
to
the
heart
because
landis
is
engaged
to
marry
my
daughter
lou
at
first
i
could
hardly
believe
in
his
disaffection
but
the
truth
has
at
length
been
borne
home
to
me
the
scoundrel
has
abandoned
both
lou
and
me
donnegan
repeated
slowly
your
daughter
loves
this
chap
the
colonel
allowed
his
glance
to
narrow
and
he
could
do
this
the
more
safely
because
at
this
moment
donnegan
eyes
were
wandering
into
the
distance
in
that
unguarded
second
donnegan
was
defenseless
and
the
colonel
read
something
that
set
him
beaming
she
loves
him
of
course
he
said
and
he
is
breaking
her
heart
with
his
selfishness
he
is
breaking
her
heart
echoed
donnegan
the
colonel
raised
his
hand
and
stroked
his
enormous
chin
decidedly
he
believed
that
things
were
getting
on
very
well
this
is
the
position
he
declared
jack
landis
was
threatened
by
the
wretch
lester
and
shot
him
down
but
lester
was
not
he
belongs
to
a
wild
crew
led
by
a
mysterious
fellow
of
whom
no
one
knows
very
much
a
deadly
fighter
it
is
said
and
a
keen
organizer
and
handler
of
men
wild
smooth
a
bundle
of
contradictions
they
call
him
lord
nick
because
he
has
the
pride
of
a
nobleman
and
the
cunning
of
the
devil
he
has
gathered
a
few
chosen
spirits
and
cool
fighters
the
pedlar
joe
rix
harry
masters
all
celebrated
names
in
the
cattle
country
they
worship
lord
nick
partly
because
he
is
a
genius
of
crime
and
partly
because
he
understands
how
to
guide
them
so
that
they
may
rob
and
even
kill
with
impunity
his
peculiarity
is
his
ability
to
keep
within
the
bounds
of
the
law
if
he
commits
a
robbery
he
always
first
establishes
marvelous
alibis
and
throws
the
blame
toward
someone
else
if
it
is
the
case
of
a
killing
it
is
always
the
other
man
who
is
the
aggressor
he
has
been
before
a
jury
half
a
dozen
times
but
the
devil
knows
the
law
and
pleads
his
own
case
with
a
tongue
that
twists
the
hearts
out
of
the
stupid
jurors
you
see
no
common
man
and
this
is
the
leader
of
the
group
of
which
lester
is
one
of
the
most
debased
members
he
had
no
sooner
been
shot
than
lord
nick
himself
appeared
he
had
his
followers
with
him
he
saw
jack
landis
threatened
him
with
death
and
made
jack
swear
that
he
would
hand
over
half
of
the
profits
of
the
mines
to
the
gang
of
which
i
suppose
lester
gets
his
due
proportion
at
the
same
time
lord
nick
attempted
to
persuade
jack
that
i
his
adopted
father
you
might
say
was
really
in
the
wrong
and
that
i
had
stolen
the
claims
from
this
wretched
lester
he
waved
this
disgusting
accusation
into
a
mist
and
laughed
with
hateful
softness
the
result
is
this
jack
landis
draws
a
vast
revenue
from
the
mines
half
of
it
he
turns
over
to
lord
nick
and
lord
nick
in
return
gives
him
absolute
freedom
and
backing
in
the
camp
where
he
is
and
probably
will
continue
the
dominant
factor
as
for
the
other
half
landis
spends
it
on
this
woman
with
whom
he
has
become
infatuated
and
not
a
penny
comes
through
to
me
colonel
macon
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
his
eyes
became
fixed
upon
a
great
distance
he
smiled
and
the
blood
turned
cold
in
the
veins
of
donnegan
of
course
this
adventuress
this
nelly
lebrun
plays
hand
in
glove
with
lord
nick
and
his
troupe
unquestionably
she
shares
her
spoils
so
that
of
the
revenue
from
the
mines
is
really
flowing
back
through
the
hands
of
lord
nick
and
jack
landis
has
become
a
silly
figurehead
he
struts
about
the
streets
of
the
corner
as
a
great
mine
owner
and
with
the
power
of
lord
nick
behind
him
not
one
of
the
people
of
the
gambling
houses
and
dance
halls
dares
cross
him
so
that
jack
has
come
to
consider
himself
a
great
man
is
it
clear
donnegan
had
not
yet
drawn
his
gaze
entirely
back
from
the
distance
this
is
the
possible
solution
went
on
the
colonel
jack
landis
must
be
drawn
away
from
the
influence
of
this
nelly
lebrun
he
must
be
brought
back
to
us
and
shown
his
folly
both
as
regards
the
adventuress
and
lord
nick
for
so
long
as
nelly
has
a
hold
on
him
just
so
long
lord
nick
will
have
his
hand
in
jack
pocket
you
see
how
beautifully
their
plans
and
their
work
dovetail
how
therefore
am
i
to
draw
him
from
nelly
there
is
only
one
way
send
my
daughter
to
the
camp
send
lou
to
the
corner
and
let
one
glimpse
of
her
beauty
turn
the
shabby
prettiness
of
this
woman
to
a
shadow
lou
is
my
last
hope
at
this
donnegan
wakened
his
sneer
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
send
her
to
a
new
mining
camp
colonel
macon
you
have
the
gambling
spirit
you
are
willing
to
take
great
chances
so
so
murmured
the
colonel
a
little
taken
aback
but
i
should
never
send
her
except
with
an
adequate
protector
an
adequate
protector
even
against
these
celebrated
gunmen
who
run
the
camp
as
you
have
already
admitted
an
adequate
protector
you
are
the
man
donnegan
shivered
i
i
take
your
daughter
to
the
camp
and
play
her
against
nelly
lebrun
to
win
back
jack
landis
is
that
the
scheme
it
is
ah
murmured
donnegan
and
he
got
up
and
began
to
walk
the
room
the
colonel
watched
him
in
a
silent
agony
of
anxiety
she
truly
loves
this
landis
asked
donnegan
swallowing
a
love
that
has
grown
out
of
their
long
intimacy
together
since
they
were
children
bah
calf
love
let
the
fellow
go
and
she
will
forget
him
hearts
are
not
broken
in
these
days
by
disappointments
in
love
affairs
the
colonel
writhed
in
his
chair
but
lou
you
do
not
know
her
heart
he
suggested
if
you
looked
closely
at
her
you
would
have
seen
that
she
is
pale
she
does
not
suspect
the
truth
but
i
think
she
is
wasting
away
because
jack
written
for
weeks
he
saw
donnegan
wince
under
the
whip
it
is
true
murmured
the
wanderer
she
is
not
like
others
heaven
knows
he
turned
and
what
if
i
fail
to
bring
over
jack
landis
with
the
sight
of
lou
the
colonel
relaxed
the
great
crisis
was
past
and
donnegan
would
undertake
the
journey
in
that
case
my
dear
lad
there
is
an
expedient
so
simple
that
you
astonish
me
by
not
perceiving
it
if
there
is
no
way
to
wean
landis
away
from
the
woman
then
get
him
alone
and
shoot
him
through
the
heart
in
that
way
you
remove
from
the
life
of
lou
a
man
unworthy
of
her
and
you
also
make
the
mines
come
to
the
heir
of
jack
landis
namely
myself
and
in
the
latter
case
donnegan
be
sure
oh
be
sure
that
i
should
not
forget
who
brought
the
mines
into
my
hands
fifty
miles
over
any
sort
of
going
is
a
stiff
march
fifty
miles
uphill
and
down
and
mostly
over
districts
where
there
was
only
a
rough
cow
path
in
lieu
of
a
road
made
a
prodigious
day
work
and
certainly
it
was
an
almost
incredible
feat
for
one
who
professed
to
hate
work
with
a
consuming
passion
and
who
had
looked
upon
an
jaunt
the
night
before
as
an
insuperable
burden
yet
such
was
the
distance
which
donnegan
had
covered
and
now
he
drove
the
pack
mule
out
on
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
in
full
view
of
the
corner
with
the
triangle
of
the
young
muddy
and
christobel
rivers
embracing
the
little
town
even
the
gaunt
leggy
mule
was
tired
to
the
dropping
point
and
the
tough
buckskin
which
trailed
up
behind
went
with
downward
head
when
louise
macon
turned
to
him
he
had
reached
the
point
where
he
swung
his
head
around
first
and
then
grudgingly
followed
the
movement
with
his
body
the
girl
was
tired
also
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
covered
every
inch
of
the
distance
in
the
saddle
there
was
that
violet
shade
of
weariness
under
her
eyes
and
her
shoulders
slumped
forward
only
donnegan
the
hater
of
labor
was
fresh
they
had
started
in
the
first
dusk
of
the
coming
day
it
was
now
the
yellow
time
of
the
slant
afternoon
sunlight
between
these
two
points
there
had
been
a
body
of
steady
plodding
the
girl
had
looked
askance
at
that
gaunt
form
of
donnegan
when
they
began
but
before
three
hours
seeing
that
the
spring
never
left
his
step
nor
the
swinging
rhythm
his
stride
she
began
to
wonder
this
afternoon
nothing
he
did
could
have
surprised
her
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
house
the
night
before
he
had
been
a
mystery
till
her
death
day
she
would
not
forget
the
fire
with
which
he
had
stared
up
at
her
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
but
when
he
came
out
of
her
father
room
not
cowed
and
whipped
as
most
men
left
it
he
had
looked
at
her
with
a
veiled
glance
and
since
that
moment
there
had
always
been
a
mist
of
indifference
over
his
eyes
when
he
looked
at
her
in
the
beginning
of
that
day
march
all
she
knew
was
that
her
father
trusted
her
to
this
stranger
donnegan
to
take
her
to
the
corner
where
he
was
to
find
jack
landis
and
bring
jack
back
to
his
old
allegiance
and
find
what
he
was
doing
with
his
time
and
his
money
it
was
a
quite
natural
proceeding
for
jack
was
a
wild
sort
and
he
was
probably
gambling
away
all
the
gold
that
was
dug
in
his
mines
it
was
perfectly
natural
throughout
except
that
she
should
have
been
trusted
so
entirely
to
a
stranger
that
was
a
remarkable
thing
but
then
her
father
was
a
remarkable
man
and
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
his
actions
had
been
inscrutable
whether
concerning
her
or
the
affairs
of
other
people
she
had
heard
men
come
into
their
house
cursing
colonel
macon
with
death
in
their
faces
she
had
seen
them
sneak
out
after
a
interview
and
never
appear
again
in
her
eyes
her
father
was
invincible
when
she
thought
of
superlatives
she
thought
of
him
her
conception
of
mystery
was
the
smile
of
the
colonel
and
her
conception
of
tenderness
was
bounded
by
the
gentle
voice
of
the
same
man
therefore
it
was
entirely
sufficient
to
her
that
the
colonel
had
said
go
and
trust
everything
to
donnegan
he
has
the
power
to
command
you
and
you
must
obey
until
jack
comes
back
to
you
that
was
odd
for
as
far
as
she
knew
jack
had
never
left
her
but
she
had
early
discarded
any
will
to
question
her
father
curiosity
was
a
thing
which
the
fat
man
hated
above
all
else
therefore
it
was
really
not
strange
to
her
that
throughout
the
journey
her
guide
did
not
speak
half
a
dozen
words
to
her
once
or
twice
when
she
attempted
to
open
the
conversation
he
had
replied
with
crushing
monosyllables
and
there
was
an
end
for
the
rest
he
was
always
swinging
down
the
trail
ahead
of
her
at
a
steady
unchanging
rapid
stride
uphill
and
down
it
never
varied
and
so
they
came
out
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
and
saw
the
storm
center
of
the
corner
they
were
in
the
hills
behind
the
town
two
miles
would
bring
them
into
it
and
now
donnegan
came
back
to
her
from
the
mule
he
took
off
his
hat
and
shook
the
dust
away
he
brushed
a
hand
across
his
face
he
was
still
unshaven
the
red
stubble
made
him
hideous
and
the
dust
and
perspiration
covered
his
face
as
with
a
mask
only
his
eyes
were
rimmed
with
white
skin
you
better
get
off
the
horse
here
said
donnegan
he
held
her
stirrup
and
she
obeyed
without
a
word
sit
down
she
sat
down
on
the
boulder
which
he
designated
and
looking
up
observed
the
first
sign
of
emotion
in
his
face
he
was
frowning
and
his
face
was
drawn
a
little
you
are
tired
he
stated
a
little
you
are
tired
said
the
wanderer
in
a
tone
that
implied
dislike
of
any
denial
therefore
she
made
no
answer
i
going
down
into
the
town
to
look
things
over
i
do
want
to
parade
you
through
the
streets
until
i
know
where
landis
is
to
be
found
and
how
he
receive
you
the
corner
is
a
wild
town
you
understand
yes
she
said
blankly
and
noted
nervously
that
the
reply
did
not
please
him
he
actually
scowled
at
her
you
be
all
right
here
i
leave
the
pack
mule
with
you
if
anything
should
happen
but
nothing
is
going
to
happen
i
be
back
in
an
hour
or
so
there
a
pool
of
water
you
can
get
a
cold
drink
there
and
wash
up
if
you
want
to
while
i
gone
but
do
go
to
sleep
why
not
a
place
like
this
is
sure
to
have
a
lot
of
stragglers
hunting
around
it
bad
characters
you
understand
she
could
not
understand
why
he
should
make
a
mystery
of
it
but
then
he
was
almost
as
strange
as
her
father
his
careful
english
and
his
ragged
clothes
were
typical
of
him
inside
and
out
you
have
a
gun
there
in
your
holster
can
you
use
it
yes
try
it
it
was
a
a
woman
light
weapon
she
took
it
out
and
balanced
it
in
her
hand
the
blue
rock
down
the
hillside
let
me
see
you
chip
it
her
hand
went
up
and
without
pausing
to
sight
along
the
barrel
she
fired
fire
flew
from
the
rock
and
there
appeared
a
white
small
scar
donnegan
sighed
with
relief
if
you
squeezed
the
butt
rather
than
pulled
the
trigger
he
commented
you
would
have
made
a
that
time
now
i
do
mean
that
in
any
likelihood
you
have
to
defend
yourself
i
simply
want
you
to
be
aware
that
there
plenty
of
trouble
around
the
corner
yes
said
the
girl
you
not
afraid
oh
no
donnegan
settled
his
hat
a
little
more
firmly
upon
his
head
he
had
been
on
the
verge
of
attributing
her
gentleness
to
a
blank
stupid
mind
he
began
to
realize
that
there
was
metal
under
the
surface
he
felt
that
some
of
the
qualities
of
the
father
were
echoed
faintly
and
at
a
distance
in
the
child
in
a
way
she
made
him
think
of
an
unawakened
creature
when
she
was
roused
if
the
time
ever
came
it
might
be
that
her
eye
could
become
a
thing
alternately
of
fire
and
ice
and
her
voice
might
carry
with
a
ring
this
business
has
to
be
gotten
through
quickly
he
went
on
one
meeting
with
jack
landis
will
be
enough
she
wondered
why
he
set
his
jaw
when
he
said
this
but
he
was
wondering
how
deeply
the
colonel
ward
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
nelly
lebrun
if
that
first
meeting
did
not
bring
landis
to
his
senses
what
followed
one
of
two
things
either
the
girl
must
stay
on
in
the
corner
and
try
her
hand
with
her
fiancé
again
or
else
the
final
brutal
suggestion
of
the
colonel
must
be
followed
he
must
kill
landis
it
was
a
suggestion
but
donnegan
was
a
man
as
he
looked
at
the
girl
where
she
sat
on
the
boulder
he
knew
definitely
first
and
last
that
he
loved
her
and
that
he
would
never
again
love
any
other
woman
every
instinct
drew
him
toward
the
necessity
of
destroying
landis
there
was
his
stumbling
block
but
what
if
she
truly
loved
landis
he
would
have
to
wait
in
order
to
find
that
out
and
as
he
stood
there
with
the
sun
shining
on
the
red
stubble
on
his
face
he
made
a
resolution
the
more
profound
because
it
was
formed
in
silence
if
she
truly
loved
landis
he
would
serve
her
hand
and
foot
until
she
had
her
will
but
all
he
said
was
simply
i
shall
be
back
before
it
dark
i
shall
be
comfortable
here
replied
the
girl
and
smiled
farewell
at
him
and
while
donnegan
went
down
the
slope
full
of
darkness
he
thought
of
that
smile
the
corner
spread
more
clearly
before
him
with
every
step
he
made
it
was
a
type
of
the
town
of
course
most
of
the
dwellings
were
tents
dog
tents
many
of
them
but
there
was
a
surprising
sprinkling
of
wooden
shacks
some
of
them
of
considerable
size
beginning
at
the
very
edge
of
the
town
and
spread
over
the
sand
flats
were
the
mines
and
the
black
sprinkling
of
laborers
and
the
town
itself
was
roughly
jumbled
around
one
street
over
to
the
left
the
main
road
into
the
corner
crossed
the
wide
shallow
ford
of
the
young
muddy
river
and
up
this
road
he
saw
half
a
dozen
wagons
coming
wagons
of
all
sizes
but
nothing
went
out
of
the
corner
people
who
came
stayed
there
it
seemed
he
dropped
over
the
lower
hills
and
the
voice
of
the
gold
town
rose
to
him
it
was
a
murmur
like
that
of
an
army
preparing
for
battle
now
and
then
a
blast
exploded
for
what
purpose
he
could
not
imagine
in
this
school
of
mining
but
as
a
rule
the
sounds
were
subdued
by
the
distance
he
caught
the
muttering
of
many
voices
in
which
laughter
and
shouts
were
brought
to
the
level
of
a
whisper
at
close
hand
and
through
all
this
there
was
a
persistent
clangor
of
metallic
sounds
no
doubt
from
the
blacksmith
shops
where
picks
and
other
implements
were
made
or
sharpened
and
all
sorts
of
repairing
carried
on
but
the
predominant
tone
of
the
voice
of
the
corner
was
this
persistent
ringing
of
metal
it
suggested
to
donnegan
that
here
was
a
town
filled
with
men
of
iron
and
all
the
gentler
parts
of
their
natures
forgotten
an
odd
place
to
bring
such
a
woman
as
lou
macon
surely
he
reached
the
level
and
entered
the
town
hunting
for
news
he
went
naturally
to
the
news
emporium
which
took
the
place
of
the
daily
paper
namely
he
went
to
the
saloons
but
on
the
way
he
ran
through
a
liberal
of
the
corner
populace
first
of
all
the
tents
and
the
ruder
shacks
he
saw
little
stoves
with
the
tin
dishes
piled
unwashed
upon
the
tops
of
them
when
the
miners
rushed
back
to
their
work
broken
handles
of
picks
and
shovels
shirts
and
overalls
lay
where
they
had
been
tossed
here
was
a
flat
strip
of
canvas
supported
by
four
poles
and
without
shelter
at
the
sides
and
the
belongings
of
one
careless
miner
tumbled
beneath
this
miserable
shelter
another
man
had
striven
for
some
semblance
of
a
home
and
he
had
framed
a
walk
leading
up
to
the
closed
flap
of
his
tent
with
stones
of
a
regular
size
but
nowhere
was
there
a
sign
of
life
and
would
not
be
until
semidarkness
brought
the
unwilling
workers
back
to
the
tents
out
of
this
district
he
passed
quickly
onto
the
main
street
and
here
there
was
a
different
atmosphere
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
man
dressed
as
a
cowpuncher
from
belt
to
spurs
spurs
on
a
miner
but
above
the
waist
he
blossomed
in
a
frock
coat
and
a
silk
hat
around
the
coat
he
had
fastened
his
belt
and
the
shirt
beneath
the
coat
was
common
flannel
open
at
the
throat
he
walked
or
rather
staggered
on
the
arm
of
an
equally
strange
companion
who
was
arrayed
in
a
white
silk
shirt
white
flannel
trousers
white
dancing
pumps
and
a
vast
sombrero
but
as
if
this
was
not
sufficient
protection
for
his
head
he
carried
a
parasol
of
the
most
brilliant
green
silk
and
twirled
it
above
his
head
the
two
held
a
wavering
course
and
went
blindly
past
donnegan
it
was
sufficiently
clear
that
the
storekeeper
had
followed
the
gold
he
noted
a
cowboy
sitting
in
his
saddle
while
he
rolled
a
cigarette
obviously
he
had
come
in
to
look
things
over
rather
than
to
share
in
the
mining
and
he
made
the
one
sane
critical
note
in
the
carnival
of
noise
and
color
donnegan
began
to
pass
stores
there
was
the
jeweler
the
gent
furnishing
a
real
estate
office
what
could
real
estate
be
doing
on
the
young
muddy
desert
here
was
the
pawnshop
the
windows
of
which
were
already
packed
the
blacksmith
had
a
great
establishment
and
the
roar
of
the
anvils
never
died
away
feed
and
grain
and
a
dozen
restaurants
all
this
had
come
to
the
corner
within
six
weeks
liquor
seemed
to
be
plentiful
too
in
the
entire
length
of
the
street
he
hardly
saw
a
sober
man
except
the
cowboy
half
a
dozen
in
one
group
pitched
silver
dollars
at
a
mark
but
he
was
in
the
saloon
district
now
and
dominant
among
the
rest
was
the
big
unpainted
front
of
a
building
before
which
hung
an
enormous
sign
lebrun
joy
emporium
donnegan
turned
in
under
the
sign
it
was
one
big
room
the
bar
stretched
completely
around
two
sides
of
it
the
floor
was
dirt
but
packed
to
the
hardness
of
wood
the
low
roof
was
supported
by
a
scattering
of
wooden
pillars
and
across
the
floor
the
gaming
tables
were
spread
at
that
vast
bar
not
ten
men
were
drinking
now
at
the
crowding
tables
there
were
not
half
a
dozen
players
yet
behind
the
bar
stood
a
dozen
tenders
ready
to
meet
the
evening
rush
from
the
mines
and
at
the
tables
waited
an
equal
number
of
the
professional
gamblers
of
the
house
from
the
door
donnegan
observed
these
things
with
one
sweeping
glance
and
then
proceeded
to
transform
himself
one
jerk
at
the
visor
of
his
cap
brought
it
down
over
his
eyes
and
covered
his
face
with
shadow
a
single
shrug
bunched
the
ragged
coat
high
around
his
shoulders
and
the
shoulders
themselves
he
allowed
to
drop
forward
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
glided
slowly
across
the
room
toward
the
bar
for
all
the
world
a
picture
of
the
guttersnipe
who
had
been
kicked
from
pillar
to
post
until
is
dead
in
him
and
pausing
in
his
advance
he
leaned
against
one
of
the
pillars
and
looked
hungrily
toward
the
bar
he
was
immediately
hailed
from
behind
the
bar
with
hey
you
no
tramps
in
here
pay
and
stay
in
lebrun
the
command
brought
an
immediate
protest
a
big
fellow
stepped
from
the
bar
his
sombrero
pushed
to
the
back
of
his
head
his
shirt
sleeves
rolled
to
the
elbow
away
from
vast
hairy
forearms
one
of
his
long
arms
swept
out
and
brought
donnegan
to
the
bar
i
ai
no
prophet
declared
the
giant
but
i
can
spot
a
man
dry
what
you
have
bud
and
to
the
bartender
he
added
leave
him
be
pardner
unless
you
all
set
for
considerable
noise
in
here
long
as
his
drinks
are
paid
for
muttered
the
bartender
here
he
stays
but
these
floaters
do
make
me
tired
he
jabbed
the
bottle
across
the
bar
at
donnegan
and
spun
a
glass
noisily
at
him
and
the
floater
observed
the
angry
bartender
with
a
frightened
side
glance
and
then
poured
his
drink
gingerly
when
the
glass
was
half
full
he
hesitated
and
sought
the
face
of
the
bartender
again
for
permission
to
go
on
fill
her
up
commanded
the
giant
fill
her
up
lad
and
drink
hearty
i
never
yet
observed
the
bartender
darkly
seen
a
beggar
that
a
hog
at
this
donnegan
protector
shifted
his
belt
so
that
the
holster
came
a
little
more
forward
on
his
thigh
son
he
said
how
long
you
been
in
these
parts
long
enough
declared
the
other
and
lowered
his
black
brows
long
enough
to
be
sick
of
it
maybe
maybe
returned
the
meantime
you
tie
to
this
we
got
queer
ways
out
here
when
a
gent
drinks
with
us
he
our
friend
this
lad
here
is
my
pardner
just
now
if
i
was
him
i
would
of
knocked
your
head
off
before
now
for
what
you
said
i
do
want
no
trouble
donnegan
said
whiningly
at
this
the
bartender
chuckled
and
the
miner
showed
his
teeth
in
his
disgust
every
gent
has
got
his
own
way
he
said
sourly
but
while
you
drink
with
hal
stern
you
drink
with
your
chin
up
bud
and
do
forget
it
and
them
that
tries
to
run
over
you
got
to
run
over
me
saying
this
he
laid
his
large
left
hand
on
the
bar
and
leaned
a
little
toward
the
bartender
but
his
right
hand
remained
hanging
loosely
at
his
side
it
was
near
the
holster
as
donnegan
noticed
and
the
bartender
having
met
the
boring
glance
of
the
big
man
for
a
moment
turned
surlily
away
the
giant
looked
to
donnegan
and
observed
know
a
good
definition
of
the
word
skunk
nope
said
donnegan
brightening
now
that
the
stern
eye
of
the
bartender
was
turned
away
here
one
that
might
do
a
skunk
is
a
critter
that
bites
when
your
back
is
turned
and
runs
when
you
look
it
in
the
eye
here
how
he
drained
his
own
glass
and
donnegan
dexterously
followed
the
example
and
what
might
you
be
doing
around
these
parts
asked
the
big
man
veiling
his
contempt
under
a
mild
geniality
me
oh
nothing
looking
for
a
job
eh
donnegan
shrugged
work
ai
my
line
he
confided
said
hal
stern
well
you
do
make
no
bones
about
it
but
just
now
continued
donnegan
i
thought
maybe
i
pick
up
some
sort
of
a
job
for
a
while
he
looked
ruefully
at
the
palms
of
his
hands
which
were
as
tender
as
the
hands
of
a
woman
heard
a
fellow
say
that
jack
landis
was
a
good
sort
to
work
for
did
rush
his
men
none
they
said
i
might
find
him
here
the
big
man
grunted
too
early
for
him
he
do
circulate
around
much
till
the
sun
goes
down
kind
of
hard
on
his
skin
the
sun
maybe
so
you
going
to
work
for
him
i
was
figuring
on
it
well
tie
to
this
bud
if
you
work
for
him
you
wo
have
him
over
you
no
no
you
have
he
glanced
a
little
uneasily
around
him
lord
nick
who
he
who
he
the
big
man
started
in
astonishment
sufferin
catamounts
who
is
he
he
laughed
in
a
disagreeable
manner
well
son
find
out
right
enough
the
way
you
talk
he
do
sound
none
too
good
hal
stern
grew
anxious
the
way
i
talk
have
i
said
anything
agin
him
not
a
word
he
he
well
there
ai
ever
been
trouble
between
us
and
there
never
ai
going
to
be
he
flushed
and
looked
steadily
at
donnegan
maybe
he
sent
you
to
talk
to
me
he
asked
coldly
but
donnegan
eyes
took
on
a
childish
wideness
why
i
never
seen
him
he
declared
hall
stern
allowed
the
muscles
of
his
face
to
relax
all
right
he
said
they
no
harm
done
but
lord
nick
is
a
name
that
ai
handled
none
too
free
in
these
here
parts
remember
that
but
how
pondered
donnegan
can
i
be
working
for
lord
nick
when
i
sign
up
to
work
under
jack
landis
i
tell
you
how
nick
and
lebrun
work
together
split
profits
and
nelly
lebrun
works
landis
for
his
dust
so
the
stuff
goes
in
a
circle
landis
to
nelly
to
lebrun
to
nick
that
clear
i
do
quite
see
it
murmured
donnegan
i
did
think
you
would
declared
the
other
and
snorted
his
disgust
but
that
all
i
going
to
say
here
come
the
boys
and
dead
dry
for
the
afternoon
was
verging
upon
evening
and
the
first
drift
of
laborers
from
the
mines
was
pouring
into
the
corner
one
thing
at
least
was
clear
to
donnegan
that
everyone
knew
how
infatuated
landis
had
become
with
nelly
lebrun
and
that
landis
had
not
built
up
an
extraordinarily
good
name
for
himself
by
the
time
absolute
darkness
had
set
in
donnegan
in
the
new
role
of
lady
chaperon
sat
before
a
dying
fire
with
louise
macon
beside
him
he
had
easily
seen
from
his
talk
with
stern
that
landis
was
a
public
figure
whether
from
the
richness
of
his
claims
or
his
relations
with
lord
nick
and
lebrun
or
because
of
all
these
things
but
as
a
public
figure
it
would
be
impossible
to
see
him
alone
in
his
own
tent
and
unless
louise
could
meet
him
alone
half
her
power
over
him
supposing
that
she
still
retained
any
would
be
lost
better
by
far
that
landis
should
come
to
her
than
that
she
should
come
to
him
so
donnegan
had
rented
two
tents
by
the
day
at
an
outrageous
figure
from
the
enterprising
real
estate
company
of
the
corner
and
to
this
new
home
he
brought
the
girl
she
accepted
the
arrangement
with
surprising
equanimity
it
seemed
that
her
father
training
had
eliminated
from
her
mind
any
questioning
of
the
motives
of
others
she
became
even
cheerful
as
she
set
about
arranging
the
pack
which
donnegan
put
in
her
tent
afterward
she
cooked
their
supper
over
the
fire
which
he
built
for
her
never
was
there
such
a
quick
and
by
the
time
it
was
absolutely
dark
they
had
washed
the
dishes
and
sat
before
lou
tent
looking
over
the
night
lights
of
the
corner
and
hearing
the
voice
of
its
great
white
way
opening
she
had
not
even
asked
why
he
did
not
bring
her
straight
to
jack
landis
she
had
looked
into
donnegan
tent
furnished
with
a
single
blanket
and
his
canvas
kit
and
had
offered
to
share
her
pack
with
him
and
now
they
sat
side
by
side
before
the
tent
and
still
she
asked
no
questions
about
what
was
to
come
her
silence
was
to
donnegan
the
dropping
of
the
water
upon
the
hard
rock
he
was
crumbling
under
it
and
a
wild
hatred
for
the
colonel
rose
in
him
no
doubt
that
spirit
of
evil
had
foreseen
all
this
and
he
knew
that
every
moment
spent
with
the
girl
would
drive
donnegan
on
closer
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
colonel
great
purpose
the
death
of
jack
landis
for
the
colonel
as
jack
next
of
kin
would
take
over
all
his
mining
interests
and
free
them
at
a
stroke
from
the
silent
partnership
which
apparently
existed
with
lord
nick
and
lester
one
bullet
would
do
all
this
and
with
jack
dead
who
else
stood
close
to
the
girl
it
was
only
necessary
that
she
should
not
know
who
sped
the
bullet
home
a
horrible
fancy
grew
up
in
donnegan
as
he
sat
there
that
between
him
and
the
girl
lay
a
dead
body
he
was
glad
when
the
time
came
and
he
could
tell
her
that
he
was
going
down
to
the
corner
to
find
jack
landis
and
bring
him
to
her
she
rose
to
watch
him
go
and
he
heard
her
say
come
soon
it
shocked
donnegan
into
realization
that
for
all
her
calm
exterior
she
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
danger
of
her
position
in
the
wild
mining
camp
she
must
know
also
that
her
reputation
would
be
compromised
yet
never
once
had
she
winced
and
donnegan
was
filled
with
wonder
as
he
went
down
the
hill
toward
the
camp
which
was
spread
beneath
him
for
their
tents
were
a
little
detached
from
the
main
body
of
the
town
behind
her
gentle
eyes
he
now
felt
and
under
the
softness
of
her
voice
there
was
the
same
iron
nerve
that
was
in
her
father
her
hatred
could
be
a
deathless
passion
and
her
love
also
and
the
great
question
to
be
answered
now
was
did
she
truly
love
jack
landis
the
corner
at
night
was
like
a
scene
at
a
circus
there
was
the
same
rush
of
people
the
same
irregular
flush
of
lights
the
same
glimmer
of
lanterns
through
canvas
the
same
air
of
impermanence
once
in
one
of
those
hushes
which
will
fall
upon
every
crowd
he
heard
a
coyote
wailing
sharply
and
far
away
as
though
the
desert
had
sent
out
this
voice
to
mock
at
the
corner
and
all
it
contained
he
had
only
to
ask
once
to
discover
where
landis
was
milligan
dance
hall
before
milligan
place
a
bonfire
burned
from
the
beginning
of
dusk
to
the
coming
of
day
and
until
the
time
when
that
fire
was
quenched
with
buckets
of
water
it
was
a
sign
to
all
that
the
merriment
was
under
way
in
the
dance
hall
if
lebrun
was
the
sun
of
the
amusement
world
in
the
corner
milligan
was
the
moon
everybody
who
had
money
to
lose
went
to
lebrun
every
one
who
was
out
for
gayety
went
to
milligan
milligan
was
a
plunger
he
had
brought
up
an
orchestra
which
demanded
fifteen
dollars
a
day
and
he
paid
them
that
and
more
he
not
only
was
able
to
do
this
but
he
established
a
bar
at
the
entrance
from
which
all
who
entered
were
served
with
a
free
drink
the
entrance
also
was
not
subject
to
charge
the
initial
drink
at
the
door
was
spiced
to
encourage
thirst
so
milligan
made
money
as
fast
and
far
more
easily
than
if
he
had
been
digging
it
out
of
the
ground
to
the
door
of
this
pleasure
emporium
came
donnegan
he
had
transformed
himself
into
the
ragged
hobo
by
the
jerking
down
of
his
cap
again
and
the
hunching
of
his
shoulders
and
shrinking
past
the
bar
with
a
hungry
sidewise
glance
as
one
who
did
not
dare
present
himself
for
free
liquor
he
entered
milligan
that
is
he
had
put
his
foot
across
the
threshold
when
he
was
caught
roughly
by
the
shoulder
and
dragged
to
one
side
he
found
himself
looking
up
into
the
face
of
a
strapping
fellow
who
served
milligan
as
bouncer
milligan
had
an
eye
for
color
andy
lewis
was
tolerably
well
known
as
a
fighting
man
of
parts
who
not
only
wore
two
guns
but
could
use
them
both
at
once
which
is
much
more
difficult
than
is
generally
understood
but
far
more
than
for
his
fighting
parts
milligan
hired
his
bouncer
for
the
sake
of
his
face
it
was
a
countenance
made
to
discourage
trouble
makers
a
mule
had
kicked
lewis
in
the
chin
and
a
great
white
welt
deformed
his
lower
lip
scars
of
smallpox
added
to
his
decorative
effect
and
he
had
those
extremely
bushy
brows
which
for
some
reason
are
generally
considered
to
denote
ferocity
now
donnegan
was
not
above
middle
height
at
best
and
in
his
present
shrinking
attitude
he
found
himself
looking
up
a
full
head
into
the
formidable
face
of
the
bouncer
and
what
are
you
doing
in
here
asked
the
genial
andy
do
you
know
this
joint
is
for
white
folks
i
ai
colored
murmured
donnegan
you
took
considerable
yaller
to
me
declared
lewis
he
straightway
chuckled
and
his
own
keen
appreciation
of
his
wit
softened
his
expression
what
you
want
donnegan
shivered
under
his
rags
i
want
to
see
jack
landis
he
said
it
had
a
wonderful
effect
upon
the
doorkeeper
donnegan
found
that
the
very
name
of
landis
was
a
charm
of
power
in
the
corner
you
want
to
see
him
he
queried
in
amazement
you
he
looked
donnegan
over
again
and
then
grinned
broadly
as
if
in
anticipation
well
go
ahead
there
he
sits
no
he
dancing
the
music
was
in
full
swing
it
was
chiefly
brass
but
now
and
then
in
softer
moments
one
could
hear
a
violin
squeaking
uncertainly
at
least
it
went
along
with
a
marked
regular
rhythm
and
the
dancers
swirled
industriously
around
the
floor
a
very
gay
crowd
color
was
apparently
appreciated
in
the
corner
and
donnegan
standing
modestly
out
of
sight
behind
a
pillar
until
the
dance
ended
noted
twenty
phases
of
life
in
twenty
faces
and
donnegan
saw
the
flushes
of
liquor
and
heard
the
loud
voices
of
happy
fellows
who
had
made
their
strikes
but
in
all
that
brilliant
crew
he
had
no
trouble
in
picking
out
jack
landis
and
nelly
lebrun
they
danced
together
and
where
they
passed
the
others
steered
a
little
off
so
as
to
give
them
room
on
the
dance
floor
as
if
the
men
feared
that
they
might
cross
the
formidable
landis
and
as
if
the
women
feared
to
be
brought
into
too
close
comparison
with
nelly
lebrun
she
was
indeed
a
brilliant
figure
she
had
eyes
of
the
creole
duskiness
a
delicate
olive
skin
with
a
pastel
coloring
the
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
landis
was
a
thing
of
fairy
beauty
and
her
eyes
had
that
peculiar
quality
of
seeming
to
see
everything
and
rest
on
every
face
particularly
so
that
as
she
whirled
toward
donnegan
he
winced
feeling
that
she
had
found
him
out
among
the
shadows
she
had
a
glorious
partner
to
set
her
off
and
donnegan
saw
bitterly
why
lou
macon
could
love
him
height
without
clumsiness
bulk
and
a
light
foot
at
once
a
fine
head
well
poised
blond
hair
and
a
grecian
profile
such
was
jack
landis
he
wore
a
vest
of
fawn
skin
his
boots
were
black
in
the
foot
and
finished
with
the
softest
red
leather
for
the
leg
and
he
had
yellow
buckskin
trousers
laced
in
a
mexican
fashion
with
silver
at
the
sides
a
narrow
belt
a
long
red
silk
handkerchief
flying
from
behind
his
neck
in
cowboy
fashion
so
much
flashing
splendor
even
in
that
gay
assembly
would
have
been
childishly
conspicuous
on
another
man
but
in
big
jack
landis
there
was
patently
a
great
deal
of
the
unaffected
child
he
was
having
a
glorious
time
on
this
evening
and
his
eye
roved
the
room
challenging
admiration
in
a
manner
that
was
amusing
rather
than
offensive
he
was
so
overflowingly
proud
of
having
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
corner
upon
his
arm
and
so
conscious
of
being
himself
probably
the
man
that
he
escaped
conceit
it
might
almost
be
said
by
his
very
excess
of
it
upon
this
splendid
individual
then
the
obscure
donnegan
bent
his
gaze
he
saw
the
dancers
pause
and
scatter
as
the
music
ended
saw
them
drift
to
the
tables
along
the
edges
of
the
room
saw
the
scurry
of
waiters
hurrying
drinks
up
in
the
interval
saw
nelly
lebrun
sip
a
lemonade
saw
jack
landis
toss
off
something
stronger
and
then
donnegan
skirted
around
the
room
and
came
to
the
table
of
jack
landis
at
the
very
moment
when
the
latter
was
tossing
a
gold
piece
to
the
waiter
and
giving
a
new
order
prodigal
sons
in
the
distance
of
thought
are
apt
to
be
both
silly
and
disgusting
but
at
close
hand
they
usually
dazzle
the
eye
even
the
cold
brain
of
donnegan
was
daunted
a
little
as
he
drew
near
he
came
behind
the
chair
of
the
tall
master
of
the
corner
and
while
nelly
lebrun
stopped
her
glass
halfway
to
her
lips
and
stared
at
the
ragged
stranger
donnegan
was
whispering
in
the
ear
of
jack
landis
i
got
to
see
you
alone
landis
turned
his
head
slowly
and
his
eye
darkened
a
little
as
he
met
the
reddish
unshaven
face
of
the
stranger
then
with
a
careless
shrug
of
distaste
he
drew
out
a
few
coins
and
poured
them
into
palm
the
latter
pocketed
them
lou
macon
said
donnegan
jack
landis
rose
from
his
chair
and
it
was
not
until
he
stood
so
close
to
donnegan
that
the
latter
realized
the
truly
herculean
proportions
of
the
young
fellow
he
bowed
his
excuses
to
nelly
lebrun
not
without
grace
of
manner
and
then
huddled
donnegan
into
a
corner
with
a
wave
of
his
vast
arm
now
what
do
you
want
who
are
you
who
put
that
name
in
your
mouth
she
in
the
corner
said
donnegan
and
he
dwelt
upon
the
face
of
jack
landis
with
feverish
suspense
a
moment
later
a
great
weight
had
slipped
from
his
heart
if
lou
macon
loved
landis
it
was
beyond
peradventure
that
landis
was
not
breaking
his
heart
because
of
the
girl
for
at
her
name
he
flushed
darkly
and
then
that
rush
of
color
fading
he
was
left
with
a
white
spot
in
the
center
of
each
cheek
first
his
glance
plunged
into
vacancy
then
it
flicked
over
his
shoulder
at
nelly
lebrun
and
he
bit
his
lip
plainly
it
was
not
the
most
welcome
news
that
jack
landis
had
ever
heard
where
is
she
he
asked
nervously
of
donnegan
and
he
looked
over
the
ragged
fellow
again
i
take
you
to
her
the
big
man
swayed
back
and
forth
from
foot
to
foot
balancing
in
his
hesitation
wait
a
moment
he
strode
to
nelly
lebrun
and
bent
over
her
donnegan
saw
her
eyes
flash
up
oh
heart
of
the
south
what
eyes
of
shadow
and
fire
jack
landis
trembled
under
the
glance
yes
he
was
deeply
in
love
with
the
girl
and
donnegan
watched
her
face
shade
with
suspicion
stiffen
with
cold
anger
warm
and
soften
again
under
the
explanations
of
jack
landis
donnegan
looking
from
the
distance
could
read
everything
it
is
nearness
that
bewitches
a
man
when
he
talks
to
a
woman
when
odysseus
talked
to
circe
no
doubt
he
stood
on
the
farther
side
of
the
room
when
landis
came
again
he
was
perspiring
from
the
trial
of
fire
through
which
he
had
just
passed
come
he
ordered
and
set
out
at
a
sweeping
stride
plainly
he
was
anxious
to
get
this
matter
done
with
as
soon
as
possible
as
for
donnegan
he
saw
a
man
whom
landis
had
summoned
to
take
his
place
sit
down
at
the
table
with
nelly
lebrun
she
was
laughing
with
the
newcomer
as
though
nothing
troubled
her
at
all
but
over
his
shoulder
her
glance
probed
the
distance
and
followed
jack
landis
she
wanted
to
see
the
messenger
again
the
man
who
had
called
her
companion
away
but
in
this
it
was
fox
challenging
fox
donnegan
took
note
and
was
careful
to
place
between
him
and
the
girl
every
pillar
and
every
group
of
people
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
her
first
glance
must
do
to
read
and
judge
and
remember
him
by
outside
landis
shot
several
questions
at
him
in
swift
succession
he
wanted
to
know
how
the
girl
had
happened
to
make
the
trip
above
all
what
the
colonel
was
thinking
and
doing
and
if
the
colonel
himself
had
come
but
donnegan
replied
with
monosyllables
and
landis
apparently
reconciling
himself
to
the
fact
that
the
messenger
was
a
fool
ceased
his
questions
they
kept
close
to
a
run
all
the
way
out
of
the
camp
and
up
the
hillside
to
the
two
detached
tents
where
donnegan
and
the
girl
slept
that
night
a
lantern
burned
in
both
the
tents
she
has
made
things
ready
for
me
thought
donnegan
his
heart
opening
she
has
kept
house
for
me
he
pointed
out
lou
tent
to
his
companion
and
the
big
man
with
a
single
low
word
of
warning
threw
open
the
flap
of
the
tent
and
strode
in
there
was
only
the
split
part
of
a
second
between
the
rising
and
the
fall
of
the
canvas
but
in
that
swift
interval
donnegan
saw
the
girl
starting
up
to
receive
landis
her
calm
was
broken
at
last
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
were
starry
with
what
expectancy
love
it
stopped
donnegan
like
a
blow
in
the
face
and
turned
his
heart
to
lead
and
then
shamelessly
he
glided
around
the
tent
and
dropped
down
beside
it
to
eavesdrop
after
all
there
was
some
excuse
if
she
loved
the
man
he
donnegan
would
let
him
live
if
she
did
not
love
him
he
donnegan
would
kill
him
like
a
worthless
rat
under
heel
that
is
if
he
could
no
wonder
that
the
wanderer
listened
with
heart
and
soul
he
missed
the
first
greeting
it
was
only
a
jumble
of
exclamations
but
now
he
heard
but
lou
what
a
wild
idea
across
the
mountains
with
whom
the
man
who
brought
you
here
who
he
i
do
know
you
do
know
he
looks
like
a
shifty
little
rat
to
me
he
big
enough
jack
such
small
praise
was
enough
to
set
donnegan
heart
thumping
besides
father
told
me
to
go
with
him
to
trust
him
ah
there
was
an
abrupt
chilling
and
lowering
of
landis
voice
the
colonel
knows
him
he
one
of
the
colonel
men
plainly
the
colonel
was
to
him
as
the
rod
to
the
child
why
did
you
come
directly
to
me
we
thought
it
would
be
better
not
to
your
guide
well
what
was
the
colonel
idea
in
sending
you
here
heavens
above
does
he
know
that
a
mining
camp
is
no
place
for
a
young
girl
and
you
have
a
sign
of
a
chaperon
lou
what
the
devil
can
i
do
what
was
in
his
mind
you
have
written
for
a
long
time
good
lord
written
letters
does
he
think
i
have
time
for
letters
the
lie
came
smoothly
enough
working
day
and
night
donnegan
smoothed
his
whiskers
and
grinned
into
the
night
landis
might
prove
better
game
than
he
had
anticipated
he
worried
said
the
girl
and
her
voice
was
as
even
as
ever
he
worried
and
sent
me
to
find
out
if
anything
is
wrong
then
nonsense
what
is
there
to
worry
about
lou
i
half
inclined
to
think
that
the
colonel
does
trust
me
she
did
not
answer
was
she
reading
beneath
the
boisterous
assurance
of
landis
one
thing
is
clear
to
me
and
to
you
too
i
hope
the
first
thing
is
to
send
you
back
in
a
hurry
still
no
answer
lou
do
you
distrust
me
at
length
she
managed
to
speak
but
it
was
with
some
difficulty
there
is
another
reason
for
sending
me
tell
me
ca
you
guess
jack
i
not
a
mind
reader
the
cad
said
donnegan
through
his
teeth
it
the
old
reason
money
yes
a
shadow
swept
across
the
side
of
the
tent
it
was
landis
waving
his
arm
carelessly
if
that
all
i
can
fix
you
up
and
send
you
back
with
enough
to
carry
the
colonel
along
look
here
why
i
have
five
hundred
with
me
take
it
lou
there
more
behind
it
but
the
colonel
must
think
that
as
much
money
in
the
mines
as
people
say
no
idea
how
much
living
costs
up
here
heavens
no
and
the
prices
for
labor
and
then
they
shirk
the
job
from
dawn
to
dark
i
have
to
watch
every
minute
i
tell
you
he
sighed
noisily
but
the
end
of
it
is
dear
how
that
small
word
tore
into
the
heart
of
donnegan
who
crouched
outside
that
you
must
go
back
tomorrow
morning
i
send
you
tonight
if
i
could
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
trust
the
rat
who
the
girl
interrupted
while
donnegan
still
had
control
of
his
temper
you
forget
jack
father
sent
me
here
but
he
did
not
tell
me
to
come
back
at
this
jack
landis
burst
into
an
enormous
laughter
you
do
mean
lou
that
you
actually
intend
to
stay
on
what
else
can
i
mean
of
course
it
makes
it
awkward
if
the
colonel
did
expressly
tell
you
just
what
to
do
i
suppose
he
left
it
to
my
discretion
and
i
decide
definitely
that
you
must
go
back
at
once
i
ca
do
it
lou
do
you
hear
me
saying
that
i
take
the
responsibility
if
your
father
blames
you
let
him
tell
me
he
broke
down
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
and
another
of
those
uncomfortable
little
pauses
ensued
donnegan
knew
that
their
eyes
were
miserably
upon
each
other
the
man
by
his
guilt
the
girl
wretchedly
guessing
at
the
things
which
lay
behind
her
fiancé
words
i
sorry
you
do
want
me
here
it
is
that
but
he
apparently
expected
to
be
interrupted
but
she
waited
coolly
for
him
to
finish
the
sentence
and
of
course
he
could
not
after
all
for
a
helpless
girl
she
had
a
devilish
effective
way
of
muzzling
landis
donnegan
chuckled
softly
in
admiration
all
at
once
she
broke
through
the
scene
her
voice
did
not
rise
or
harden
but
it
was
filled
with
finality
as
though
she
were
weary
of
the
interview
i
tired
out
it
been
a
hard
ride
jack
you
go
home
now
and
look
me
up
again
any
time
tomorrow
i
lou
i
feel
mighty
bad
about
having
you
up
here
in
this
infernal
tent
when
the
camp
is
full
and
you
ca
lie
across
the
entrance
to
my
tent
and
guard
me
jack
besides
i
do
need
you
for
that
the
man
who
with
me
will
protect
me
he
does
look
capable
of
protecting
a
cat
my
father
said
that
in
any
circumstances
he
would
be
able
to
take
care
of
me
this
reply
seemed
to
overwhelm
landis
the
colonel
trusts
him
as
far
as
all
that
he
muttered
then
i
suppose
you
safe
enough
but
what
about
comfort
lou
i
done
without
comfort
all
my
life
run
along
jack
and
take
this
money
with
you
i
ca
have
it
but
did
the
colonel
send
you
can
express
it
through
to
him
to
me
it
not
pleasant
to
take
it
why
lou
you
do
mean
good
night
jack
i
do
mean
anything
except
that
i
tired
the
shadow
swept
along
the
wall
of
the
tent
again
donnegan
with
a
shaking
pulse
saw
the
profile
of
the
girl
and
the
man
approach
as
he
strove
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
good
night
and
then
one
slender
bar
of
shadow
checked
landis
not
tonight
lou
you
are
angry
with
me
no
but
you
know
i
have
queer
ways
just
put
this
down
as
one
of
them
i
ca
explain
there
was
a
muffled
exclamation
and
landis
went
from
the
tent
and
strode
down
the
hill
he
was
instantly
lost
in
the
night
but
donnegan
turning
to
the
entrance
flap
called
softly
he
was
bidden
to
come
in
and
when
he
raised
the
flap
he
saw
her
sitting
with
her
hands
clasped
loosely
and
resting
upon
her
knees
her
lips
were
a
little
parted
and
colorless
her
eyes
were
dull
with
a
mist
and
though
she
rallied
herself
a
little
the
wanderer
could
see
that
she
was
only
of
him
the
face
which
he
saw
was
a
milestone
in
his
life
for
he
had
loved
her
jealously
fiercely
before
but
seeing
her
now
dazed
hurt
and
uncomplaining
tenderness
came
into
donnegan
it
spread
to
his
heart
with
a
strange
pain
and
made
his
hands
tremble
all
that
he
said
was
is
there
anything
you
need
nothing
she
replied
and
he
backed
out
and
away
but
in
that
small
interval
he
had
turned
out
of
the
course
of
his
gay
selfish
life
if
jack
landis
had
hurt
her
like
this
if
she
loved
him
so
truly
then
jack
landis
she
should
have
there
was
an
odd
mixture
of
emotions
in
donnegan
but
he
felt
most
nearly
like
the
poor
man
from
whose
hand
his
daughter
tugs
back
and
looks
wistfully
hopelessly
into
the
bright
window
at
all
the
toys
what
pain
is
there
greater
than
the
pain
that
comes
to
the
poor
man
in
such
a
time
he
huddles
his
coat
about
him
for
his
heart
is
as
cold
as
a
christmas
day
and
if
it
would
make
his
child
happy
he
would
pour
out
his
heart
blood
on
the
snow
such
was
the
grief
of
donnegan
as
he
backed
slowly
out
into
the
night
though
jack
landis
were
fixed
as
high
as
the
moon
he
would
tear
him
out
of
his
place
and
give
him
to
the
girl
the
lantern
went
out
in
the
tent
she
was
asleep
and
when
he
knew
that
donnegan
went
down
into
the
corner
he
had
been
trying
to
think
out
a
plan
of
action
and
finding
nothing
better
than
to
thrust
a
gun
stupidly
under
landis
nose
and
make
him
mark
time
donnegan
went
into
place
as
if
he
hoped
the
bustle
there
would
supply
him
with
ideas
lebrun
was
going
full
blast
it
was
not
filled
with
the
shrill
mirth
of
milligan
instead
all
voices
were
subdued
to
a
point
here
the
pitch
was
never
raised
if
a
man
laughed
he
might
show
his
teeth
but
he
took
good
care
that
he
did
not
break
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
for
there
was
a
deadly
undercurrent
of
silence
which
would
not
tolerate
more
than
murmurs
on
the
part
of
others
men
sat
over
the
cards
the
man
who
was
winning
with
his
cold
eager
eye
the
chronic
loser
of
the
night
with
his
iron
smile
the
professional
ever
debonair
with
the
dull
eye
which
comes
from
looking
too
often
and
too
closely
into
the
terrible
face
of
chance
a
very
keen
observer
might
have
observed
a
resemblance
between
those
men
and
donnegan
donnegan
roved
swiftly
here
and
there
the
calm
eye
and
the
smooth
play
of
an
obvious
professional
in
a
linen
suit
kept
him
for
a
moment
at
one
table
looking
on
then
he
went
to
the
games
and
after
changing
the
gold
which
jack
landis
had
given
as
alms
so
silver
dollars
he
lost
it
with
precision
upon
the
wheel
he
went
on
from
table
to
table
from
group
to
group
in
lebrun
his
clothes
were
not
noticed
it
was
no
matter
whether
he
played
or
did
not
play
whether
he
won
or
lost
they
were
too
busy
to
notice
but
he
came
back
at
length
to
the
man
who
wore
the
linen
coat
and
who
won
so
easily
something
in
his
method
of
dealing
appeared
to
interest
donnegan
greatly
it
was
jackpot
the
chips
were
piled
high
and
the
man
in
the
linen
coat
was
dealing
again
how
deftly
he
mixed
the
cards
indeed
all
about
him
was
elegant
from
the
turn
of
his
black
cravat
to
the
cut
of
the
coat
an
inebriate
passed
shouldered
and
disturbed
his
chair
and
rising
to
put
it
straight
again
the
gambler
was
seen
to
be
about
the
height
and
build
of
donnegan
donnegan
studied
him
with
the
interest
of
an
artist
here
was
a
man
harking
back
to
nelly
lebrun
and
her
love
of
brilliance
who
would
probably
win
her
preference
over
jack
landis
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
was
different
that
is
there
was
more
in
his
cravat
to
attract
astonished
attention
in
the
corner
than
there
was
in
all
the
silver
lace
of
landis
and
he
was
a
man
man
no
doubt
of
that
on
the
inebriate
he
had
flashed
one
glance
of
fire
and
his
lean
hand
had
stirred
uneasily
toward
the
breast
of
his
coat
donnegan
who
missed
nothing
saw
and
understood
interested
he
was
fascinated
by
this
man
because
he
recognized
the
kinship
which
existed
between
them
they
might
almost
have
been
blood
brothers
except
for
differences
in
the
face
he
knew
for
instance
just
what
each
glance
of
the
man
in
the
linen
coat
meant
and
how
he
was
weighing
his
antagonists
as
for
the
others
they
were
cool
players
themselves
but
here
they
had
met
their
master
it
was
the
difference
between
the
amateur
and
the
professional
they
played
good
chancey
poker
but
the
man
in
the
linen
coat
did
more
he
stacked
the
cards
for
the
first
moment
donnegan
was
not
sure
it
was
not
until
there
was
a
slight
faltering
in
the
deal
an
infinitely
small
hesitation
which
only
a
practiced
eye
like
that
of
donnegan
could
have
noticed
that
he
was
sure
the
winner
was
crooked
yet
the
hand
was
interesting
for
all
that
he
had
done
the
master
trick
not
only
giving
himself
the
winning
hand
but
also
giving
each
of
the
others
a
fine
set
of
cards
and
the
betting
was
wild
on
that
historic
pot
to
begin
with
the
smallest
hand
was
three
of
a
kind
and
after
the
draw
the
weakest
was
a
straight
and
they
bet
furiously
the
stranger
had
piqued
them
with
his
consistent
victories
now
they
were
out
for
blood
chips
having
been
exhausted
solid
gold
was
piled
up
on
the
table
a
small
fortune
the
man
in
the
linen
coat
in
the
middle
of
the
hand
called
for
drinks
they
drank
they
went
on
with
the
betting
and
then
at
last
came
the
call
donnegan
could
have
clapped
his
hands
to
applaud
the
smooth
rascal
it
was
not
an
affair
of
breaking
the
others
who
sat
in
they
were
all
prosperous
mine
owners
and
probably
they
had
been
carefully
selected
according
to
the
size
of
purse
in
preparation
for
the
sacrifice
but
the
stakes
were
swept
into
the
arms
and
then
the
canvas
bag
of
the
winner
if
it
was
not
enough
to
ruin
the
miners
it
was
at
least
enough
to
clean
them
out
of
ready
cash
and
discontinue
the
game
on
that
basis
they
rose
they
went
to
the
bar
for
a
drink
but
while
the
winner
led
the
way
two
of
the
losers
dropped
back
a
trifle
and
fell
into
earnest
conversation
frowning
donnegan
knew
perfectly
what
the
trouble
was
they
had
noticed
that
slight
faltering
in
the
deal
they
were
putting
their
mental
notes
on
the
game
together
but
the
winner
apparently
unconscious
of
suspicion
lined
up
his
victims
at
the
bar
the
first
drink
went
hastily
down
the
second
was
on
the
way
it
was
standing
on
the
bar
and
here
he
excused
himself
he
broke
off
in
the
very
middle
of
a
story
and
telling
them
that
he
would
be
back
any
moment
stepped
into
a
crowd
of
newcomers
the
moment
he
disappeared
donnegan
saw
the
other
four
put
their
heads
close
together
and
saw
a
sudden
darkening
of
faces
but
as
for
the
genial
winner
he
had
no
sooner
passed
to
the
other
side
of
the
crowd
and
out
of
view
than
he
turned
directly
toward
the
door
his
careless
saunter
was
exchanged
for
a
brisk
walk
and
donnegan
without
making
himself
conspicuous
was
hard
pressed
to
follow
that
pace
at
the
door
he
found
that
the
gambler
with
his
canvas
sack
under
his
arm
had
turned
to
the
right
toward
the
line
of
saddle
horses
which
stood
in
the
shadow
and
no
sooner
did
he
reach
the
gloom
at
the
side
of
the
building
than
he
broke
into
a
soft
swift
run
he
darted
down
the
line
of
horses
until
he
came
to
one
which
was
already
mounted
this
donnegan
saw
as
he
followed
somewhat
more
leisurely
and
closer
to
the
horses
to
avoid
observance
he
made
out
that
the
man
already
on
horseback
was
a
big
negro
and
that
he
had
turned
his
own
mount
and
a
neighboring
horse
out
from
the
rest
of
the
horses
so
that
they
were
both
pointing
down
the
street
of
the
corner
donnegan
saw
the
negro
throw
the
lines
of
his
lead
horse
into
the
air
in
exchange
he
caught
the
sack
which
the
runner
tossed
to
him
and
then
the
gambler
leaped
into
his
saddle
it
was
a
simple
but
effective
plan
suppose
he
were
caught
in
the
midst
of
a
cheat
his
play
would
be
to
break
away
to
the
outside
of
the
building
shooting
out
the
lights
if
possible
trusting
to
the
confusion
to
help
him
and
there
he
would
find
his
horse
held
ready
for
him
at
a
time
when
a
second
might
be
priceless
on
this
occasion
no
doubt
the
clever
rascal
had
sensed
the
suspicion
of
the
others
at
any
rate
he
lost
no
time
he
waited
neither
to
find
his
stirrups
nor
grip
the
reins
firmly
but
the
same
athletic
leap
which
carried
him
into
the
saddle
set
the
horse
in
motion
and
from
a
standing
start
the
animal
broke
into
a
headlong
gallop
he
received
however
an
additional
burden
at
once
for
donnegan
from
the
second
time
he
saw
the
man
of
the
linen
coat
had
been
revolving
a
daring
plan
and
during
the
poker
game
the
plan
had
slowly
matured
the
moment
he
made
sure
that
the
gambler
was
heading
for
a
horse
he
increased
his
own
speed
ordinarily
he
would
have
been
noted
but
now
no
doubt
the
gambler
feared
no
pursuit
except
one
accompanied
by
a
hue
and
cry
he
did
not
hear
the
donnegan
racing
over
the
soft
ground
behind
him
but
when
he
had
gained
the
saddle
donnegan
was
close
behind
with
the
impetus
of
his
run
to
aid
him
it
was
comparatively
simple
therefore
to
spring
high
in
the
air
and
he
struck
fairly
and
squarely
behind
the
saddle
of
the
man
in
the
linen
coat
when
he
landed
his
revolver
was
in
his
hand
and
the
muzzle
jabbed
into
the
back
of
the
gambler
the
other
made
one
frantic
effort
to
twist
around
then
recognized
the
pressure
of
the
revolver
and
was
still
the
horses
checking
their
gallops
in
unison
were
softly
down
the
street
call
off
your
man
warned
donnegan
for
the
big
negro
had
reined
back
the
gun
already
gleamed
in
his
hand
a
gesture
from
the
gambler
sent
the
gun
into
obscurity
yet
still
the
fellow
continued
to
fall
back
tell
him
to
ride
ahead
keep
in
front
george
and
not
too
far
very
well
and
now
we
talk
later
go
straight
on
george
to
the
clump
of
trees
beyond
the
end
of
the
street
and
ride
straight
no
dodging
it
was
a
good
hand
you
played
continued
donnegan
taking
note
that
of
the
many
people
who
were
now
passing
them
none
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
two
men
riding
on
one
horse
and
chatting
together
as
they
rode
it
was
a
good
hand
but
a
bad
deal
your
thumb
slipped
on
the
card
eh
you
saw
eh
muttered
the
other
and
two
of
the
others
saw
it
but
they
were
sure
till
afterward
i
know
the
blockheads
but
i
spoiled
their
game
for
them
are
you
one
of
us
pal
but
donnegan
smiled
to
himself
for
once
at
least
the
appeal
of
gambler
to
gambler
should
fail
keep
straight
on
he
said
we
talk
later
on
before
donnegan
gave
the
signal
to
halt
in
a
clear
space
where
the
starlight
was
least
indistinct
they
reached
the
center
of
the
trees
now
george
he
said
drop
your
gun
to
the
ground
there
was
a
flash
and
faint
thud
now
the
other
gun
they
ai
any
more
sir
your
other
gun
repeated
donnegan
a
little
pause
do
what
he
tells
you
george
said
the
gambler
at
length
and
a
second
weapon
fell
now
keep
on
your
horse
and
keep
a
little
off
to
the
side
went
on
donnegan
and
remember
that
if
you
try
to
give
me
the
jump
i
might
miss
you
in
this
light
but
i
be
sure
to
hit
your
horse
so
do
take
chances
george
now
sir
just
hold
your
hands
over
your
head
and
then
dismount
he
had
already
gone
through
the
gambler
and
taken
his
weapons
he
was
now
obeyed
the
man
of
the
linen
coat
tossed
up
his
arms
flung
his
right
leg
over
the
horn
of
the
saddle
and
slipped
to
the
ground
donnegan
joined
his
captive
i
warn
you
first
he
said
gently
that
i
am
quite
expert
with
a
revolver
and
that
it
will
be
highly
dangerous
to
attempt
to
trick
me
lower
your
arms
if
you
wish
but
please
be
careful
of
what
you
do
with
your
hands
there
are
such
things
as
knife
throwing
i
know
but
it
takes
a
fast
wrist
to
flip
a
knife
faster
than
a
bullet
we
understand
each
other
perfectly
agreed
the
other
by
the
way
my
name
is
godwin
and
suppose
we
become
frank
you
are
in
temporary
distress
it
was
impossible
for
you
to
make
a
loan
at
the
moment
and
you
are
driven
to
this
forced
touch
now
if
half
hush
said
donnegan
you
are
too
generous
but
the
present
question
is
not
one
of
money
i
have
long
since
passed
over
that
the
money
is
now
mine
steady
this
to
george
who
lurched
in
the
saddle
but
godwin
was
calm
as
stone
it
is
not
the
question
of
the
money
that
troubles
me
but
the
question
of
the
men
i
could
easily
handle
one
of
you
but
i
fear
to
allow
both
of
you
to
go
free
you
would
return
on
my
trail
there
are
such
things
as
waylayings
by
night
eh
and
so
godwin
i
think
my
best
way
out
is
to
shoot
you
through
the
head
when
your
body
is
found
it
will
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
servant
killed
the
master
for
the
sake
of
the
money
which
he
won
by
crooked
card
play
i
think
that
simple
put
your
hands
up
george
or
by
heck
i
let
the
starlight
shine
through
you
the
huge
arms
of
george
were
raised
above
his
head
godwin
in
the
meantime
had
not
spoken
i
almost
think
you
mean
it
he
said
after
a
short
pause
good
said
donnegan
i
do
not
wish
to
kill
you
unprepared
there
was
a
strangled
sound
deep
in
the
throat
of
godwin
then
he
was
able
to
speak
again
but
now
his
voice
was
made
into
a
horrible
jumble
by
fear
pal
he
said
you
dead
wrong
george
here
he
a
devil
if
you
let
him
live
he
kill
you
as
sure
as
you
standing
here
you
know
him
he
george
green
he
got
a
record
as
long
as
my
arm
and
as
bad
as
the
devil
name
he
he
the
man
to
get
rid
of
me
why
man
you
and
i
could
team
it
together
but
george
not
donnegan
began
to
laugh
and
the
gambler
stammered
to
a
halt
i
knew
you
when
i
laid
eyes
on
you
for
the
first
time
said
donnegan
you
have
the
hands
of
a
craftsman
but
your
eyes
are
put
too
close
together
a
coward
eyes
a
cur
face
godwin
but
you
george
have
you
heard
what
he
said
no
answer
from
george
but
a
snarl
it
sounds
logical
what
he
said
eh
george
dead
silence
but
said
donnegan
there
are
flaws
in
the
plan
godwin
get
out
of
your
clothes
the
other
fell
on
his
knees
for
heaven
sake
he
pleaded
shut
up
commanded
donnegan
i
not
going
to
shoot
you
i
never
intended
to
you
fool
but
i
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
worth
splitting
the
coin
with
you
not
now
get
out
of
your
clothes
he
was
obeyed
in
fumbling
haste
and
while
that
operation
went
on
he
succeeded
in
jumping
out
of
his
own
rags
and
still
kept
the
two
fairly
steadily
under
the
nose
of
his
gun
he
tossed
this
bundle
to
godwin
who
accepted
it
with
a
faint
oath
and
donnegan
stepped
calmly
and
swiftly
into
the
clothes
of
his
victim
a
perfect
fit
he
said
at
length
and
to
show
that
i
pleased
here
your
purse
back
must
be
close
to
two
hundred
in
that
from
the
weight
godwin
muttered
some
unintelligible
curse
tush
now
get
out
if
you
show
your
face
in
the
corner
again
some
of
those
miners
will
spot
you
and
they
dress
you
in
tar
and
feathers
you
fool
if
they
see
you
in
my
clothes
they
never
see
these
after
tonight
probably
you
have
other
clothes
in
your
packs
godwin
lots
of
you
the
sort
who
knows
how
to
dress
and
i
borrow
your
outfit
get
out
the
other
made
no
reply
a
weight
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
him
along
with
his
new
outfit
and
he
slunk
into
the
darkness
george
made
a
move
to
follow
there
was
a
muffled
shriek
from
godwin
who
fled
headlong
and
then
a
sharp
command
from
donnegan
stopped
the
big
man
come
here
said
donnegan
george
washington
green
rode
slowly
closer
if
i
let
you
go
what
would
you
do
there
was
a
glint
of
teeth
i
find
him
and
break
him
in
two
eh
instead
i
going
to
take
you
home
where
you
have
a
chance
of
breaking
me
in
two
instead
there
something
about
the
cut
of
your
shoulders
and
your
head
that
i
like
green
and
if
you
do
murder
me
in
the
first
hour
or
so
i
think
we
get
on
very
well
together
you
hear
the
silence
of
george
washington
green
was
a
tremendous
thing
now
ride
ahead
of
me
i
direct
you
how
to
go
he
went
first
straight
back
through
the
town
and
up
the
hill
to
the
two
tents
he
made
george
go
before
him
into
the
tent
and
take
up
the
roll
of
bedding
and
then
with
george
and
the
bedding
leading
the
way
and
donnegan
leading
the
two
horses
behind
they
went
across
the
hillside
to
a
shack
which
he
had
seen
vacated
that
evening
it
certainly
could
not
be
rented
again
before
morning
and
in
the
meantime
donnegan
would
be
in
possession
which
was
a
large
part
of
the
law
in
the
corner
as
he
knew
a
little
against
the
main
shack
served
as
a
stable
the
creek
down
the
hillside
was
the
watering
trough
and
donnegan
stood
by
while
the
big
negro
silently
tended
to
the
horses
removing
the
packs
and
preparing
them
for
the
night
still
in
silence
he
produced
a
small
lantern
and
lighted
it
it
showed
his
face
for
the
first
time
the
skin
ebony
black
and
polished
over
the
cheekbones
but
the
rest
of
the
face
almost
handsome
except
that
the
slight
flare
of
his
nostrils
gave
him
a
cast
of
inhuman
ferocity
and
the
fierceness
was
given
point
by
a
pair
of
arms
of
gorilla
length
broad
shoulders
padded
with
rolling
muscles
and
the
neck
of
a
bull
on
the
whole
donnegan
a
connoisseur
of
fighting
men
had
never
seen
such
promise
of
strength
at
his
gesture
george
led
the
way
into
the
house
it
was
more
commodious
than
most
of
the
shacks
of
the
corner
in
place
of
a
single
room
this
had
two
compartments
one
for
the
kitchen
and
another
for
the
living
room
in
vacating
the
hut
the
last
occupants
had
left
some
of
the
furnishings
behind
them
there
was
a
mirror
for
instance
in
the
corner
and
beneath
the
mirror
a
cheap
table
in
whose
open
drawer
appeared
a
tumble
of
papers
donnegan
dropped
the
heavy
sack
of
winnings
to
the
floor
and
while
george
hung
the
lantern
on
a
nail
on
the
wall
donnegan
crossed
to
the
table
and
appeared
to
run
through
the
papers
he
was
humming
carelessly
while
he
did
it
but
all
the
time
he
watched
with
catlike
intensity
the
reflection
of
george
in
the
mirror
above
him
he
saw
rather
dimly
for
the
cheap
glass
showed
all
its
images
in
waves
that
george
turned
abruptly
after
hanging
up
the
lantern
paused
and
then
whipped
a
hand
into
his
coat
pocket
and
out
again
donnegan
leaped
lightly
to
one
side
and
the
knife
hissing
past
his
head
buried
itself
in
the
wall
and
its
vibrations
set
up
a
vicious
humming
as
for
donnegan
the
leap
that
carried
him
to
one
side
whirled
him
about
also
he
faced
the
big
man
who
was
now
crouched
in
the
very
act
of
following
the
knife
cast
with
the
lunge
of
his
powerful
body
there
was
no
weapon
in
donnegan
hand
and
yet
george
hesitated
balanced
and
then
slowly
drew
himself
erect
he
was
puzzled
an
outburst
of
oaths
the
flash
of
a
gun
and
he
would
have
been
at
home
in
the
brawl
but
the
silence
the
smile
of
donnegan
and
the
steady
glance
were
too
much
for
him
he
moistened
his
lips
and
yet
he
could
not
speak
and
donnegan
knew
that
what
paralyzed
george
was
the
manner
in
which
he
had
received
warning
evidently
the
simple
explanation
of
the
mirror
did
not
occur
to
the
fellow
and
the
whole
incident
took
on
supernatural
colorings
a
phrase
of
explanation
and
donnegan
would
become
again
an
ordinary
human
being
but
while
the
small
link
was
a
mystery
the
brain
and
body
of
george
were
numb
it
was
necessary
above
all
to
continue
inexplicable
donnegan
turning
drew
the
knife
from
the
wall
with
a
jerk
half
the
length
of
the
keen
blade
had
sunk
into
the
wood
a
mute
tribute
to
the
force
and
speed
of
george
hand
and
now
donnegan
took
the
bright
little
weapon
by
the
point
and
gave
it
back
to
the
other
if
you
throw
for
the
body
instead
of
the
head
said
donnegan
you
have
a
better
chance
of
sending
the
point
home
he
turned
his
back
again
upon
the
gaping
giant
and
drawing
up
a
broken
box
before
the
open
door
he
sat
down
to
contemplate
the
night
not
a
sound
behind
him
it
might
be
that
the
big
fellow
had
regained
his
nerve
and
was
stealing
up
for
a
second
attempt
but
donnegan
would
have
wagered
his
soul
that
george
washington
green
had
his
first
and
last
lesson
and
that
he
would
rather
play
with
bare
lightning
than
ever
again
cross
his
new
master
at
length
when
you
make
down
the
bunks
said
donnegan
put
mine
farthest
from
the
kitchen
you
had
better
do
that
first
yes
sir
came
the
deep
bass
murmur
behind
him
and
the
heart
of
donnegan
stirred
for
that
sir
meant
many
things
presently
george
crossed
the
floor
with
a
burden
there
was
the
whish
of
the
blankets
being
unrolled
and
then
a
slight
pause
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
hear
a
heavier
breathing
why
and
searching
swiftly
back
through
his
memory
he
recalled
that
his
other
gun
a
was
in
the
center
of
his
blanket
roll
and
he
knew
that
george
had
the
weapon
in
his
big
hand
one
pressure
of
the
trigger
would
put
an
end
to
donnegan
one
bullet
would
give
george
the
canvas
sack
and
its
small
treasure
when
you
clean
my
gun
said
donnegan
take
the
action
to
pieces
and
go
over
every
part
he
could
actually
feel
the
start
of
george
then
yes
sir
in
a
subdued
whisper
if
the
escape
from
the
knife
had
startled
george
this
second
incident
had
convinced
him
that
his
new
master
possessed
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
and
donnegan
paying
no
further
heed
to
him
looked
steadily
across
the
hillside
to
the
white
tent
of
lou
macon
fifty
yards
away
his
plan
grown
to
full
stature
so
swiftly
and
springing
out
of
nothing
well
nigh
had
come
out
of
his
first
determination
to
bring
jack
landis
back
to
lou
macon
for
he
could
interpret
those
blank
misty
eyes
with
which
she
had
sat
after
the
departure
of
landis
in
only
one
way
yet
to
rule
even
the
hand
of
big
jack
landis
would
be
hard
enough
and
to
rule
his
heart
was
quite
another
story
remembering
nelly
lebrun
he
saw
clearly
that
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
be
brought
back
to
lou
was
first
to
remove
nelly
as
a
possibility
in
his
eyes
but
how
remove
nelly
as
long
as
it
was
her
cue
from
her
father
to
play
landis
for
his
money
how
remove
her
unless
it
were
possible
to
sweep
nelly
off
her
feet
with
another
man
she
might
indeed
be
taken
by
storm
and
if
she
once
slighted
landis
for
the
sake
of
another
his
boyish
pride
would
probably
do
the
rest
and
his
next
step
would
be
to
return
to
lou
macon
all
this
seemed
logical
but
where
find
the
man
to
storm
the
heart
of
nelly
and
dazzle
her
bright
clever
eyes
his
own
rags
had
made
him
shrug
his
shoulders
and
it
was
the
thought
of
clothes
which
had
made
him
fasten
his
attention
so
closely
on
the
man
of
the
linen
suit
in
lebrun
donnegan
with
money
with
clothes
and
with
a
few
notorious
escapades
behind
him
yes
donnegan
with
such
a
flying
start
might
flutter
the
heart
of
nelly
lebrun
for
a
moment
but
he
must
have
the
money
the
clothes
and
then
he
must
deliberately
set
out
to
startle
the
corner
make
himself
a
public
figure
talked
of
pointed
at
known
feared
respected
and
even
loved
by
at
least
a
few
he
must
accomplish
all
these
things
beginning
at
a
literal
zero
it
was
the
impossible
nature
of
this
that
tempted
donnegan
but
the
paradoxical
picture
of
the
ragged
skulker
in
milligan
actually
sitting
at
the
same
table
with
nelly
lebrun
and
receiving
her
smiles
stayed
with
him
he
intended
to
rise
literally
phoenixlike
out
of
ashes
and
the
next
morning
in
the
red
time
of
the
dawn
he
sat
drinking
the
coffee
which
george
washington
green
had
made
for
him
and
considering
the
details
of
the
problem
clothes
which
had
been
a
main
obstacle
were
now
accounted
for
since
as
he
had
suspected
the
packs
of
godwin
contained
a
luxurious
wardrobe
of
considerable
compass
at
that
moment
for
instance
donnegan
was
wrapped
in
a
dressing
gown
of
padded
silk
and
his
feet
were
encased
in
slippers
but
clothes
were
the
least
part
of
his
worries
to
startle
the
corner
and
thereby
make
himself
attractive
in
the
eyes
of
nelly
lebrun
overshadowing
jack
landis
that
was
the
thing
but
to
startle
the
corner
where
gold
strikes
were
events
of
every
hours
just
now
where
robberies
were
common
gossip
and
where
the
killings
now
averaged
nearly
three
a
day
to
startle
the
corner
was
like
trying
to
startle
the
theatrical
world
with
a
sensational
play
indeed
this
parallel
could
have
been
pursued
for
donnegan
was
the
nameless
actor
and
the
mountain
desert
was
the
stage
on
which
he
intended
to
become
a
headliner
no
wonder
then
that
his
lean
face
was
compressed
in
thought
yet
no
one
could
have
guessed
it
by
his
conversation
at
the
moment
he
was
interrupted
his
talk
ran
somewhat
as
follows
george
godwin
taught
you
how
to
make
coffee
yes
sir
from
george
since
the
night
before
he
had
appeared
totally
subdued
never
once
did
he
venture
a
comment
and
ever
donnegan
was
conscious
of
big
bright
eyes
watching
him
in
a
reverent
fear
not
untinged
by
superstition
once
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
had
wakened
and
seen
the
vast
shadow
of
george
form
leaning
over
the
sack
of
money
murder
by
stealth
in
the
dark
had
been
in
the
giant
mind
no
doubt
but
when
after
that
he
came
and
leaned
over
donnegan
bunk
the
master
closed
his
eyes
and
kept
on
breathing
regularly
and
finally
george
returned
to
his
own
place
softly
as
a
gigantic
cat
even
in
the
master
sleep
he
found
something
to
be
dreaded
and
donnegan
knew
that
he
could
now
trust
the
fellow
through
anything
in
the
morning
at
the
first
touch
of
light
he
had
gone
to
the
stores
and
collected
provisions
and
a
comfortable
breakfast
followed
godwin
resumed
donnegan
was
talented
in
many
ways
the
big
man
showed
his
teeth
in
silence
for
since
godwin
proposed
the
sacrifice
of
the
servant
to
preserve
himself
george
had
apparently
altered
his
opinion
of
the
gambler
a
talented
man
george
but
he
knew
nothing
about
coffee
it
should
never
boil
it
should
only
begin
to
cream
through
the
crust
let
that
happen
take
the
pot
from
the
fire
put
it
back
and
let
the
surface
cream
again
do
this
three
times
and
then
pour
the
liquid
from
the
grounds
and
you
have
the
right
strength
and
the
right
heating
you
understand
yes
sir
and
concerning
the
frying
of
bacon
at
this
point
the
interruption
came
in
the
shape
of
four
men
at
the
open
door
and
one
of
these
donnegan
recognized
as
the
real
estate
dealer
who
had
shrewdly
set
up
tents
and
shacks
on
every
favorable
spot
in
the
corner
and
was
now
reaping
a
rich
harvest
gloster
was
his
name
it
was
patent
that
he
did
not
see
in
the
man
in
the
silk
dressing
robe
the
unshaven
miscreant
of
the
day
before
who
had
rented
the
two
tents
he
said
standing
on
the
threshold
with
the
other
three
in
the
background
donnegan
looked
at
him
and
through
him
my
name
is
gloster
i
own
this
shack
and
i
come
to
find
out
why
you
in
it
george
said
donnegan
speak
to
him
tel
him
that
i
know
houses
are
scarce
in
the
corner
that
i
found
this
place
by
accident
vacant
that
i
intend
to
stay
in
it
on
purpose
george
washington
green
instantly
rose
to
the
situation
he
swallowed
a
vast
grin
and
strode
to
the
door
and
though
gloster
face
crimsoned
with
rage
at
such
treatment
he
controlled
his
voice
in
the
corner
manhood
was
apt
to
be
reckoned
by
the
pound
and
george
was
a
giant
i
heard
what
your
boss
said
buddie
said
gloster
but
i
rented
this
cabin
and
the
next
one
to
these
three
gents
and
their
party
and
they
want
a
home
nothing
to
do
but
vacate
which
speed
is
the
thing
i
want
thirty
minutes
will
thirty
minutes
do
change
nothing
declared
george
in
his
deep
soft
voice
the
real
estate
man
choked
then
you
tell
your
boss
that
jumping
a
cabin
is
like
jumping
a
claim
they
a
law
in
the
corner
for
gents
like
him
george
made
a
gesture
of
helplessness
but
gloster
turned
to
the
three
both
shacks
or
none
at
all
said
the
spokesman
one
ai
big
enough
to
do
us
any
good
but
if
this
bird
wo
vamoose
he
was
a
tolerably
sort
and
he
was
backed
by
two
of
a
kind
no
doubt
dangerous
action
would
have
followed
had
not
george
shown
himself
capable
of
rising
to
a
height
he
stepped
from
the
door
he
approached
gloster
and
said
in
a
confidential
whisper
that
reached
easily
to
the
other
three
they
ai
any
call
for
a
quick
play
mister
watch
maybe
you
do
know
who
the
boss
is
and
what
more
i
do
care
said
gloster
defiantly
but
with
his
voice
instinctively
lowered
he
stared
past
george
and
behold
the
man
in
the
dressing
gown
still
sat
in
quiet
and
sipped
his
coffee
it
donnegan
whispered
george
don
who
he
you
do
know
donnegan
the
mingled
contempt
and
astonishment
of
george
would
have
moved
a
thing
of
stone
it
certainly
troubled
gloster
and
he
turned
to
the
three
gents
he
said
they
two
things
we
can
do
try
the
law
and
law
a
lame
lady
in
these
parts
or
throw
him
out
say
which
the
three
looked
from
gloster
to
the
shack
from
the
shack
to
donnegan
absently
sipping
his
coffee
from
donnegan
to
george
who
stood
exhibiting
a
broad
grin
of
anticipated
delight
the
contrast
was
too
much
for
them
there
is
one
great
and
terror
in
the
mountain
desert
and
that
is
for
the
man
who
may
be
other
than
he
seems
the
giant
with
the
rough
voice
and
the
boisterous
ways
is
generally
due
for
a
stormy
passage
west
of
the
rockies
but
the
silent
man
with
the
gentle
manners
receives
respect
traditions
live
of
desperadoes
with
exteriors
of
womanish
calm
and
the
action
of
devils
and
donnegan
sipping
his
morning
coffee
fitted
into
the
picture
which
rumor
had
painted
the
three
looked
at
one
another
declared
that
they
had
not
come
to
fight
for
a
house
but
to
rent
one
that
the
real
estate
agent
could
go
to
the
devil
for
all
of
them
and
that
they
were
bound
elsewhere
so
they
departed
and
left
gloster
both
relieved
and
gloomy
now
said
donnegan
to
george
tell
him
that
we
take
both
the
shacks
and
he
can
add
fifty
per
cent
to
his
old
price
the
bargain
was
concluded
on
the
spot
the
money
was
paid
by
george
gloster
went
down
the
hill
to
tell
the
corner
that
a
mystery
had
hit
the
town
and
george
brought
the
canvas
bag
back
to
donnegan
with
the
top
still
untied
as
though
to
let
it
be
seen
that
he
had
not
pocketed
any
of
the
gold
i
do
want
to
count
it
said
donnegan
keep
the
bag
george
keep
money
in
your
pocket
treat
both
of
us
well
and
when
that
gone
get
more
if
the
manner
in
which
donnegan
had
handled
the
renting
of
the
cabins
had
charmed
george
he
was
wholly
entranced
by
this
last
touch
of
free
spending
to
serve
a
man
who
was
his
master
was
one
thing
to
serve
one
who
trusted
him
so
completely
was
quite
another
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
a
man
who
was
a
riddle
was
sufficiently
delightful
but
to
be
allowed
actually
to
share
in
the
mystery
was
a
superhappiness
he
was
singing
when
he
started
to
wash
the
dishes
and
donnegan
went
across
the
hill
to
the
tent
of
lou
macon
she
was
laying
the
fire
before
the
tent
and
the
morning
freshness
had
cleared
from
her
face
any
vestige
of
the
trouble
of
the
night
before
and
in
the
slant
light
her
hair
was
glorious
all
ruffling
gold
semitransparent
she
did
not
smile
at
him
but
she
could
give
the
effect
of
smiling
while
her
face
remained
grave
it
was
her
inward
calm
content
of
which
people
were
aware
you
missed
me
yes
you
were
worried
no
he
felt
himself
put
quietly
at
a
distance
so
he
took
her
up
the
hill
to
her
new
home
the
shack
beside
his
own
and
george
cooked
her
breakfast
when
she
had
been
served
donnegan
drew
the
big
man
to
one
side
she
your
mistress
said
donnegan
everything
you
do
for
her
is
worth
two
things
you
do
for
me
watch
her
as
if
she
were
in
your
eye
and
if
a
hair
of
her
head
is
ever
harmed
you
see
that
fire
burning
yonder
the
bed
of
coals
sir
i
catch
you
and
make
a
fire
like
that
and
feed
you
into
it
by
inches
and
the
pale
face
of
donnegan
became
for
an
instant
the
face
of
a
demon
george
washington
green
saw
and
never
forgot
afterward
in
order
that
he
might
think
donnegan
got
on
one
of
the
horses
he
had
taken
from
godwin
and
rode
over
the
hills
they
were
both
leggy
chestnuts
with
surprising
signs
of
blood
and
all
the
earmarks
of
sprinters
but
in
godwin
trade
sharp
getaways
were
probably
often
necessary
the
pleasure
he
took
in
the
action
of
the
animal
kept
him
from
getting
into
his
problem
how
to
startle
the
corner
how
follow
up
the
opening
gun
which
he
had
fired
at
the
expense
of
gloster
and
the
three
miners
he
broke
off
later
in
the
day
to
write
a
letter
to
colonel
macon
informing
him
that
jack
landis
was
tied
hard
and
fast
by
nelly
lebrun
and
that
for
the
present
nothing
could
be
done
except
wait
unless
the
colonel
had
suggestions
to
offer
the
thought
of
the
colonel
however
stimulated
donnegan
and
before
midafternoon
he
had
thought
of
a
thing
to
do
the
bar
in
milligan
was
not
nearly
so
pretentious
an
affair
as
the
bar
in
lebrun
but
it
was
of
a
far
higher
class
milligan
had
even
managed
to
bring
in
a
few
bottles
of
wine
and
he
had
dispensed
cheap
claret
at
two
dollars
a
glass
when
the
miners
wished
to
celebrate
a
rare
occasion
there
were
complaints
not
of
the
taste
but
of
the
lack
of
strength
so
milligan
fortified
his
liquor
with
pure
alcohol
and
after
that
the
claret
went
like
a
sweet
song
in
the
corner
among
other
things
he
sold
mint
juleps
and
it
was
the
memory
of
the
big
sign
proclaiming
this
fact
that
furnished
donnegan
with
his
idea
he
had
george
washington
green
put
on
his
town
clothes
a
riding
suit
in
which
godwin
had
had
him
dress
for
the
sake
of
formal
occasions
resplendent
in
black
boots
yellow
riding
breeches
and
blue
silk
shirt
the
big
man
came
before
donnegan
for
instructions
go
down
to
milligan
said
the
master
they
do
allow
colored
people
to
enter
the
door
but
you
go
to
the
door
and
start
for
the
bar
they
wo
let
you
go
very
far
when
they
stop
you
tell
them
you
come
from
donnegan
and
that
you
have
to
get
me
some
mint
for
a
julep
insist
the
bouncer
will
start
to
throw
you
out
george
showed
his
teeth
no
fighting
back
do
lift
your
hand
when
you
find
that
you
get
in
come
back
here
now
ride
so
george
mounted
the
horse
and
went
straight
to
milligan
he
rode
and
dismounted
and
half
of
the
corner
scant
daytime
population
came
into
the
street
to
see
the
brilliant
horseman
pass
lewis
met
the
big
man
at
the
door
and
size
meant
little
to
andy
except
an
easier
target
well
confound
my
soul
said
lewis
blocking
the
way
a
negro
in
milligan
get
out
big
george
did
not
move
i
been
sent
mister
he
said
mildly
i
been
sent
for
enough
mint
to
make
a
julep
you
been
sent
to
the
wrong
place
declared
andy
hitching
at
his
cartridge
belt
ai
you
seen
that
sign
and
he
pointed
to
the
one
which
eliminated
colored
patrons
signs
do
mean
nothin
to
my
boss
said
george
who
he
donnegan
and
who
donnegan
it
puzzled
george
he
scratched
his
head
in
bewilderment
seeking
for
an
explanation
donnegan
is
donnegan
he
explained
i
heard
gloster
talk
about
him
offered
someone
in
the
rapidly
growing
group
he
the
gent
that
rented
the
two
places
on
the
hill
tell
him
to
come
said
andy
lewis
we
do
play
no
favorites
at
milligan
mister
said
big
george
i
do
want
to
bring
no
trouble
on
this
heah
place
but
do
make
me
go
back
and
bring
donnegan
even
andy
lewis
was
staggered
by
this
assurance
rules
is
rules
he
finally
decided
and
out
you
go
big
george
stepped
from
the
doorway
and
mounted
his
horse
i
call
on
all
you
he
said
to
the
assembled
group
to
say
that
i
done
tried
my
best
to
do
this
peaceable
it
ai
me
that
sent
for
donnegan
it
him
he
rode
away
leaving
lewis
biting
his
long
mustaches
in
anxiety
he
was
not
exactly
afraid
but
he
waited
in
the
suspense
which
comes
before
a
battle
moreover
an
audience
was
gathering
the
word
went
about
as
only
a
rumor
of
mischief
can
travel
new
men
had
gathered
the
few
day
gamblers
tumbled
out
of
lebrun
across
the
street
to
watch
the
fun
the
storekeepers
were
in
their
doors
lebrun
himself
withered
and
dark
and
yellow
of
eye
came
to
watch
and
here
and
there
through
the
crowd
there
was
a
spot
of
color
where
the
women
of
the
town
appeared
and
among
others
nelly
lebrun
with
jack
landis
beside
her
on
the
whole
it
was
not
a
large
crowd
but
what
it
lacked
in
size
it
made
up
in
intense
interest
for
though
the
corner
had
had
its
share
of
troubles
of
fist
and
gun
most
of
them
were
entirely
impromptu
affairs
here
was
a
fight
in
the
offing
for
which
the
stage
was
set
the
actors
set
in
full
view
of
a
conveniently
posted
audience
and
all
the
suspense
of
a
curtain
rising
the
waiting
bore
in
upon
andy
lewis
without
a
doubt
he
intended
to
kill
his
man
neatly
and
with
dispatch
but
the
possibility
of
missing
before
such
a
crowd
as
this
sent
a
chill
up
and
down
his
spine
if
he
failed
now
his
name
would
be
a
sign
for
laughter
ever
after
in
the
corner
a
hum
passed
down
the
street
it
rose
to
a
chuckle
and
then
fell
away
to
sudden
silence
for
donnegan
was
coming
he
came
on
a
prancing
chestnut
horse
which
sidled
uneasily
on
a
weaving
course
as
though
it
wished
to
show
off
for
the
benefit
of
the
rider
and
the
crowd
at
once
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
and
donnegan
linen
riding
suit
shone
an
immaculate
white
he
came
straight
down
the
street
as
unaware
of
the
audience
which
awaited
him
as
though
he
rode
in
a
park
where
crowds
were
the
common
thing
behind
him
came
george
green
just
a
careful
length
back
rumor
went
before
the
two
with
a
whisper
on
either
side
that
donnegan
there
he
comes
who
donnegan
gloster
man
the
one
who
bluffed
out
gloster
and
three
others
he
pulled
his
shooting
iron
and
trimmed
the
whiskers
of
one
of
with
a
chunk
of
lead
mean
that
what
that
kind
of
a
gent
doing
in
the
corner
come
to
buy
i
guess
he
looks
like
money
looks
like
a
confounded
dude
we
see
his
hand
in
a
minute
donnegan
was
now
opposite
the
dance
hall
and
andy
lewis
had
his
hand
touching
the
butt
of
his
gun
but
though
donnegan
was
looking
straight
at
him
he
kept
his
reins
in
one
hand
and
his
heavy
riding
crop
in
the
other
and
without
a
move
toward
his
own
gun
he
rode
straight
up
to
the
door
of
the
dance
hall
with
andy
in
front
of
it
george
drew
rein
behind
him
and
turned
upon
the
crowd
one
broad
superior
grin
as
who
should
say
i
promised
you
lightning
now
watch
it
strike
if
the
crowd
had
been
expectant
before
it
was
now
reduced
to
tenseness
are
you
the
fellow
who
turned
back
my
man
asked
donnegan
his
quiet
voice
fell
coldly
upon
the
soul
of
andy
he
strove
to
warm
himself
by
an
outbreak
of
temper
they
ai
any
poor
fool
dude
can
call
me
a
fellow
he
shouted
the
crowd
blinked
but
when
it
opened
its
eyes
the
gunplay
had
not
occurred
the
hand
of
andy
was
relaxing
from
the
butt
of
his
gun
and
an
expression
of
astonishment
and
contempt
was
growing
upon
his
face
i
have
come
to
curse
you
said
the
rider
still
occupying
his
hands
with
crop
and
reins
i
come
to
ask
you
a
question
and
get
an
answer
are
you
the
fellow
who
turned
back
my
man
i
guess
you
ai
the
kind
i
was
expectin
to
call
on
me
drawled
andy
his
fear
gone
and
he
winked
at
the
crowd
but
the
others
were
not
yet
ready
to
laugh
something
about
the
calm
face
of
donnegan
had
impressed
them
sure
i
the
one
that
kicked
him
out
he
ai
allowed
in
there
it
the
last
of
my
thoughts
to
break
in
upon
a
convention
in
your
city
replied
the
grave
rider
but
my
man
was
sent
on
an
errand
and
therefore
he
had
a
right
to
expect
courtesy
george
get
off
your
horse
and
go
into
milligan
place
i
want
that
mint
for
a
moment
andy
was
too
stunned
to
answer
then
his
voice
came
harshly
and
he
swayed
from
side
to
side
gathering
and
summoning
his
wrath
keep
out
boy
keep
out
or
you
buzzard
meat
i
warnin
for
the
first
time
his
glance
left
the
rider
to
find
george
and
that
instant
was
fatal
the
hand
of
donnegan
licked
out
as
the
snake
tongue
darts
the
loaded
quirt
slipped
over
in
his
hand
and
holding
it
by
the
lash
he
brought
the
butt
of
it
thudding
on
the
head
of
andy
even
then
the
instinct
to
fight
remained
in
the
stunned
man
while
he
fell
he
was
drawing
the
revolver
he
lay
in
a
crumpling
heap
at
the
feet
of
donnegan
horse
with
the
revolver
shoved
muzzle
first
into
the
sand
donnegan
voice
did
not
rise
go
in
and
get
that
mint
george
he
ordered
and
hurry
this
rascal
has
kept
me
waiting
until
i
thirsty
big
george
hesitated
only
one
instant
it
was
to
sweep
the
crowd
for
the
second
time
with
his
confident
grin
and
he
strode
through
the
door
of
the
dance
hall
as
for
donnegan
his
only
movement
was
to
swing
his
horse
around
and
shift
riding
crop
and
reins
into
the
grip
of
his
left
hand
his
other
hand
was
dropped
carelessly
upon
his
hip
now
both
these
things
were
very
simple
maneuvers
but
the
corner
noted
that
his
change
of
face
had
enabled
donnegan
to
bring
the
crowd
under
his
eye
and
that
his
right
hand
was
now
ready
for
a
more
serious
bit
of
work
if
need
be
moreover
he
was
probing
faces
with
his
glance
and
every
armed
man
in
that
group
felt
that
the
eye
of
the
rider
was
directed
particularly
toward
him
there
had
been
one
brief
murmur
then
the
silence
lay
heavily
again
for
it
was
seen
that
andy
had
been
only
slightly
stunned
knocked
out
as
a
boxer
might
be
now
his
sturdy
brains
were
clearing
his
body
stiffened
into
a
human
semblance
once
more
he
fumbled
found
the
butt
of
his
gun
with
his
first
move
he
pushed
his
hat
straight
and
so
doing
he
raked
the
welt
which
the
blow
had
left
on
his
head
the
pain
finished
clearing
the
mist
from
his
mind
in
an
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
maddened
with
shame
he
saw
the
semicircle
of
white
faces
and
the
whole
episode
flashed
back
on
him
he
had
been
knocked
down
like
a
dog
for
a
moment
he
looked
into
the
blank
faces
of
the
crowd
someone
noted
that
there
was
no
gun
strapped
at
the
side
of
donnegan
a
voice
shouted
a
warning
stop
lewis
the
dude
ai
got
a
gun
it
murder
it
was
now
that
lewis
saw
donnegan
sitting
the
saddle
directly
behind
him
and
he
whirled
with
a
moan
of
fury
it
was
a
twist
of
his
body
in
his
eagerness
rather
than
a
turning
upon
his
feet
and
he
was
half
around
before
the
rider
moved
then
he
conjured
a
gun
from
somewhere
in
his
clothes
there
was
the
flash
of
the
steel
an
explosion
and
lewis
was
on
his
knees
with
a
scream
of
pain
holding
his
right
forearm
with
his
left
hand
the
crowd
hesitated
still
for
a
second
as
though
it
feared
to
interfere
but
donnegan
had
already
put
up
his
weapon
a
wave
of
the
curious
spectators
rushed
across
the
street
and
gathered
around
the
injured
man
they
found
that
he
had
been
shot
through
the
fleshy
part
of
the
thumb
and
the
bullet
ranging
down
the
arm
had
sliced
a
furrow
to
the
bone
all
the
way
to
the
elbow
it
was
a
grisly
wound
big
george
washington
green
came
running
to
the
door
of
the
dance
hall
with
a
sprig
of
something
green
in
his
hand
one
glance
assured
him
that
all
was
well
and
once
more
that
wide
confident
grin
spread
upon
his
face
he
came
to
the
master
and
offered
the
mint
and
donnegan
raising
it
to
his
face
inhaled
the
scent
deeply
good
he
said
and
now
for
a
julep
george
let
go
home
across
the
street
a
girl
had
clasped
the
arm
of
her
companion
in
hysterical
excitement
did
you
see
she
asked
of
her
tall
companion
i
saw
a
murderer
shoot
down
a
man
he
ought
to
be
hung
for
it
but
the
mint
did
you
see
him
smile
over
it
oh
what
a
devil
he
is
and
what
a
man
jack
landis
flashed
a
glance
of
suspicion
down
at
her
but
her
dancing
eyes
had
quite
forgotten
him
they
were
following
the
progress
of
donnegan
down
the
street
he
rode
slowly
and
george
kept
that
formal
distance
just
a
length
behind
before
milligan
the
crowd
began
to
buzz
like
murmuring
hornets
around
a
nest
that
has
been
tapped
when
they
pour
out
and
can
not
find
the
disturber
it
was
a
rather
helpless
milling
around
the
wounded
man
and
nelly
lebrun
was
the
one
who
worked
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
came
to
andy
lewis
she
did
not
like
andy
she
had
been
known
to
refer
to
him
as
a
cowardly
hawk
of
a
man
but
now
she
bullied
the
crowd
in
a
shrill
voice
and
made
them
bring
water
and
cloth
then
she
cleansed
and
bandaged
the
wound
in
andy
lewis
arm
and
had
some
of
them
take
him
away
by
this
time
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
had
melted
away
but
those
who
had
really
seen
all
parts
of
the
little
drama
remained
to
talk
the
subject
was
a
real
one
had
donnegan
aimed
at
the
hand
of
andy
and
risked
his
own
life
on
his
ability
to
disable
the
other
without
killing
him
or
had
he
fired
at
lewis
body
and
struck
the
hand
and
arm
only
by
a
random
lucky
chance
if
the
second
were
the
case
he
was
only
a
fair
shot
with
plenty
of
nerve
and
a
great
deal
of
luck
if
the
first
were
true
then
this
was
a
nerve
of
steel
an
eye
and
a
hand
miraculous
fast
and
certain
to
strike
that
swinging
hand
with
a
snap
shot
when
a
miss
meant
a
bullet
fired
at
his
own
body
at
deadly
short
range
truly
it
would
take
a
credulous
man
to
believe
that
donnegan
had
coldly
planned
to
disable
his
man
without
killing
him
a
murderer
by
intention
exclaimed
milligan
he
had
hunted
long
and
hard
before
he
found
a
man
with
a
face
like
that
of
lewis
capable
of
maintaining
order
by
a
glance
now
he
wanted
revenge
a
murder
by
intention
he
cried
to
the
crowd
standing
beside
the
place
where
the
imprint
of
andy
knees
was
still
in
the
sand
and
like
a
murderer
he
ought
to
be
treated
he
aimed
to
kill
andy
he
had
luck
and
only
broke
his
hand
now
boys
i
say
it
ai
so
much
what
he
done
as
the
way
he
done
it
he
given
us
the
laugh
he
come
in
here
in
his
dude
clothes
and
tried
to
walk
over
us
but
it
do
work
not
in
the
corner
if
andy
was
dead
i
say
lynch
the
dude
but
he
ai
and
all
i
say
is
run
him
out
of
town
here
there
was
a
brief
outburst
of
applause
but
when
it
ended
it
was
observed
that
there
was
a
low
soft
laughter
the
crowd
gave
way
between
milligan
and
the
mocker
it
was
seen
that
he
who
laughed
was
old
lebrun
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
showing
his
teeth
in
his
mirth
there
was
no
love
lost
between
lebrun
and
milligan
even
if
nelly
was
often
in
the
dance
hall
and
the
center
of
its
merriment
it
takes
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
said
lebrun
enigmatically
when
he
saw
that
he
had
the
ear
of
the
crowd
and
it
takes
a
man
to
catch
a
man
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
that
a
dozen
voices
asked
i
mean
that
if
you
got
men
enough
to
run
out
this
man
donnegan
the
corner
is
a
better
town
than
i
think
it
brought
a
growl
but
no
answer
lebrun
had
never
been
seen
to
lift
his
hand
but
he
was
more
dreaded
than
a
rattler
we
try
said
milligan
dryly
i
ai
much
of
a
man
myself
there
were
dark
rumors
about
milligan
past
and
the
crowd
chuckled
at
this
modesty
but
i
try
my
hand
agin
him
with
a
bit
of
backing
and
first
i
want
to
tell
you
boys
that
they
ai
any
danger
of
him
having
aimed
at
andy
hand
i
tell
you
it
ai
possible
hardly
for
him
to
have
planned
to
hit
a
swingin
target
like
that
maybe
some
could
do
it
i
dunno
how
about
lord
nick
sure
lord
nick
might
do
anything
but
donnegan
ai
lord
nick
not
by
twenty
pounds
and
three
inches
this
brought
a
laugh
and
by
comparison
with
the
terrible
and
familiar
name
of
lord
nick
donnegan
became
a
smaller
danger
besides
as
milligan
said
it
was
undoubtedly
luck
and
when
he
called
for
volunteers
three
or
four
stepped
up
at
once
the
others
made
a
general
milling
as
though
each
were
trying
to
get
forward
and
each
were
prevented
by
the
crowd
in
front
but
in
the
background
big
jack
landis
was
seriously
trying
to
get
to
the
firing
line
he
was
encumbered
with
the
clinging
weight
of
nelly
lebrun
do
go
jack
she
pleaded
please
please
be
sensible
for
my
sake
she
backed
this
appeal
with
a
lifting
of
her
eyes
and
a
parting
of
her
lips
and
jack
landis
paused
you
wo
go
dear
jack
now
jack
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
girl
was
only
half
sincere
it
is
the
peculiar
fate
of
men
that
they
always
know
when
a
woman
is
playing
with
them
but
from
samson
down
they
always
go
to
the
slaughter
with
open
eyes
hoping
each
moment
that
the
girl
has
been
seriously
impressed
at
last
as
for
jack
landis
his
slow
mind
did
not
readily
get
under
the
surface
of
the
arts
of
nelly
but
he
knew
that
there
was
at
least
a
tinge
of
real
concern
in
the
girl
desire
to
keep
him
from
the
posse
which
milligan
was
raising
but
they
something
about
him
that
i
do
like
nelly
something
sort
of
familiar
that
i
do
like
for
naturally
enough
he
did
not
recognize
the
transformed
donnegan
and
the
name
he
had
never
heard
before
a
gunfighter
that
what
he
is
why
jack
sometimes
they
call
you
the
same
thing
say
that
you
hunt
for
trouble
now
and
then
do
they
say
that
asked
the
young
chap
quickly
flushing
with
vanity
oh
i
aim
to
take
care
of
myself
and
i
like
to
take
a
hand
with
this
murdering
donnegan
jack
listen
do
go
keep
away
from
him
why
do
you
look
like
that
as
if
i
was
a
dead
one
already
i
tell
you
jack
he
kill
you
something
in
her
terrible
assurance
whitened
the
cheeks
of
landis
but
he
was
also
angered
when
a
very
young
man
becomes
both
afraid
and
angry
he
is
apt
to
be
dangerous
what
do
you
know
of
him
he
asked
suspiciously
you
silly
but
i
saw
his
face
when
he
lifted
that
mint
he
already
forgotten
about
the
man
he
had
just
shot
down
he
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
scent
of
the
mint
and
did
you
notice
his
giant
servant
he
never
had
a
moment
doubt
of
donnegan
ability
to
handle
the
entire
crowd
i
tell
you
it
gave
me
a
chill
of
ghosts
to
see
the
big
black
fellow
eyes
he
knew
that
donnegan
would
win
and
donnegan
won
jack
you
a
big
man
and
a
strong
man
and
a
brave
man
and
we
all
know
it
but
do
be
foolish
stay
away
from
donnegan
he
wavered
just
an
instant
if
she
could
have
sustained
her
pleading
gaze
a
moment
longer
she
would
have
won
him
but
at
the
critical
instant
her
gaze
became
distant
she
was
seeing
the
calm
face
of
donnegan
as
he
raised
the
mint
and
as
though
he
understood
jack
landis
hardened
i
glad
you
do
want
me
shot
up
nelly
he
said
coldly
mighty
good
of
you
to
watch
out
for
me
but
i
going
to
run
this
donnegan
out
of
town
he
never
harmed
you
why
i
do
like
his
looks
for
a
man
like
me
that
enough
and
he
strode
away
toward
milligan
he
was
greeted
by
a
cheer
just
as
the
girl
reached
the
side
of
her
father
jack
is
going
she
said
make
him
come
back
but
the
old
man
was
still
rubbing
his
hands
there
seemed
to
be
a
perpetual
chill
in
the
tips
of
the
fingers
he
is
a
jackass
the
moment
i
first
saw
his
face
i
knew
that
he
was
meant
for
gun
fodder
buzzard
food
let
him
go
bah
the
girl
shivered
and
then
the
mines
she
asked
changing
her
tactics
ah
yes
the
mines
but
leave
that
to
lord
nick
he
handle
it
well
enough
so
jack
landis
strode
up
the
hill
first
and
foremost
of
the
six
stalwart
men
who
wished
to
correct
the
stranger
apparent
misunderstandings
of
the
status
of
the
corner
they
were
each
armed
to
the
teeth
and
each
provided
with
enough
bullets
to
disturb
a
small
city
all
this
in
honor
of
donnegan
they
found
the
shack
wrapped
in
the
warm
mellow
light
of
the
late
afternoon
and
on
a
rock
outside
it
big
george
sat
whittling
a
stick
into
a
grotesque
imitation
of
a
snake
coiled
he
did
not
rise
when
the
posse
approached
he
merely
rocked
back
upon
the
rock
embraced
his
knees
in
both
of
his
enormous
arms
and
in
a
word
transformed
himself
into
a
round
ball
of
mirth
but
having
hugged
away
his
laughter
he
was
able
to
convert
his
joy
into
a
vast
grin
that
smile
stopped
the
posse
when
a
mob
starts
for
a
scene
of
violence
the
least
exhibition
of
fear
incenses
it
but
mockery
is
apt
to
pour
water
on
its
flames
of
anger
decidedly
the
fury
of
the
posse
was
chilled
by
the
grin
of
george
milligan
who
had
lived
south
of
the
line
stepped
up
to
impress
george
properly
boy
he
said
frowning
go
in
and
tell
your
man
that
we
come
for
him
tell
him
to
step
right
out
here
and
get
ready
to
talk
we
mean
him
no
harm
he
ca
explain
one
or
two
things
hop
along
the
boy
did
not
stir
only
he
shifted
his
eyes
from
face
to
face
and
his
grin
broadened
ripples
of
mirth
waved
along
his
chest
and
convulsed
his
face
but
still
he
did
not
laugh
go
in
and
tell
them
things
to
donnegan
he
said
but
do
ask
me
to
wake
him
up
he
soun
an
fas
like
a
baby
mostly
he
sleeps
every
day
to
get
rested
up
for
the
night
now
ca
wait
till
donnegan
wakes
up
tonight
no
then
step
right
in
but
if
is
set
on
wakin
him
up
now
george
will
jus
step
over
the
hill
because
he
want
to
be
near
the
explosion
at
this
he
allowed
his
mirth
free
rein
his
laughter
shook
up
to
his
throat
to
his
enormous
mouth
it
rolled
and
bellowed
across
the
hillside
and
the
posse
stood
each
man
in
his
place
and
looked
frigidly
upon
one
another
but
having
been
laughed
at
they
felt
it
necessary
to
go
on
and
do
or
die
so
they
strode
across
the
hill
and
were
almost
to
the
door
when
another
phenomenon
occurred
a
girl
in
a
cheap
calico
dress
of
blue
was
seen
to
run
out
of
a
neighboring
shack
and
spring
up
before
the
door
of
donnegan
hut
when
she
faced
the
crowd
it
stopped
again
the
soft
wind
was
blowing
the
blue
dress
into
lovely
long
curving
lines
about
her
throat
a
white
collar
of
some
sheer
stuff
was
being
lifted
into
waves
or
curling
against
her
cheek
and
the
golden
hair
in
disorder
was
tousled
low
upon
her
forehead
whirling
thus
upon
the
crowd
she
shocked
them
to
a
pause
with
her
parted
lips
her
flare
of
delicate
color
have
you
come
here
she
cried
for
for
donnegan
lady
began
someone
and
then
looked
about
for
jack
landis
who
was
considered
quite
a
hand
with
the
ladies
but
jack
landis
was
discovered
fading
out
of
view
down
the
hillside
one
glance
at
that
blue
dress
had
quite
routed
him
for
now
he
remembered
the
man
who
had
escorted
lou
macon
to
the
corner
and
the
colonel
singular
trust
in
this
fellow
it
explained
much
and
he
fled
before
he
should
be
noticed
before
the
spokesman
could
continue
his
speech
the
girl
had
whipped
inside
the
door
and
the
posse
was
dumbfounded
milligan
saw
that
the
advance
was
ruined
boys
he
said
we
came
to
fight
a
man
not
to
storm
a
house
with
a
woman
in
it
let
go
back
we
tend
to
donnegan
later
on
we
drill
him
clean
muttered
the
others
furiously
and
straightway
the
posse
departed
down
the
hill
but
inside
the
girl
had
found
to
her
astonishment
that
donnegan
was
stretched
upon
his
bunk
wrapped
again
in
the
silken
dressing
gown
and
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
he
looked
much
younger
as
he
slept
and
perhaps
it
was
this
that
made
the
girl
steal
forward
upon
tiptoe
and
touch
his
shoulder
so
gently
he
was
up
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
alas
vanity
vanity
donnegan
in
shoes
was
one
thing
for
his
shoes
were
of
a
particular
kind
but
donnegan
in
his
slippers
was
a
full
two
inches
shorter
he
was
hardly
taller
than
the
girl
he
was
if
the
bitter
truth
must
be
known
almost
a
small
man
and
donnegan
was
furious
at
having
been
found
by
her
in
such
careless
attire
and
without
those
shoes
first
he
wanted
to
cut
the
throat
of
big
george
what
have
you
done
what
have
you
done
cried
the
girl
in
one
of
those
whispers
of
fear
they
have
come
for
you
a
whole
crowd
of
armed
men
they
outside
the
door
what
have
you
done
it
was
something
done
for
me
i
know
donnegan
suddenly
transferred
his
wrath
from
big
george
to
the
mob
outside
my
door
he
asked
and
as
he
spoke
he
slipped
on
a
belt
at
which
a
heavy
holster
tugged
down
on
one
side
and
buckled
it
around
him
oh
no
no
no
she
pleaded
and
caught
him
in
her
arms
donnegan
allowed
her
to
stop
him
with
that
soft
power
for
a
moment
until
his
face
went
white
as
if
with
pain
then
he
adroitly
gathered
both
her
wrists
into
one
of
his
bony
hands
and
having
rendered
her
powerless
he
slipped
by
her
and
cast
open
the
door
it
was
an
empty
scene
upon
which
they
looked
with
big
george
rocking
back
and
forth
upon
a
rock
convulsed
with
silent
laughter
donnegan
looked
sternly
at
the
girl
and
swallowed
he
was
fearfully
susceptible
to
mockery
there
seems
to
have
been
a
jest
he
said
but
she
lifted
him
a
happy
tearful
face
ah
thank
heaven
she
cried
gently
oddly
enough
donnegan
at
this
set
his
teeth
and
turned
upon
his
heel
and
the
girl
stole
out
the
door
again
and
closed
it
softly
behind
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
even
the
terrible
colonel
inspired
in
her
quite
the
fear
which
donnegan
instilled
big
landis
lost
his
nerve
and
sidestepped
at
the
last
minute
and
then
the
whole
gang
faded
that
was
the
way
the
rumors
of
the
affair
always
ended
at
each
repetition
in
lebrun
and
milligan
that
night
the
corner
had
had
many
things
to
talk
about
during
its
brief
existence
but
nothing
to
compare
with
a
man
who
entered
a
shooting
scrape
with
such
a
fellow
as
lewis
all
for
the
sake
of
a
spray
of
mint
and
the
main
topic
of
conversation
was
did
donnegan
aim
at
the
body
or
the
hand
of
the
bouncer
on
the
whole
it
was
an
excellent
thing
for
milligan
the
place
was
fairly
well
crowded
with
a
few
vacant
tables
for
everyone
wanted
to
hear
milligan
version
of
the
affair
he
had
a
short
and
vigorous
one
trimmed
with
neat
oaths
it
was
all
the
girl
in
the
blue
calico
dress
according
to
him
the
posse
could
storm
a
house
with
a
woman
in
it
or
even
conduct
a
proper
lynching
in
her
presence
and
no
one
was
able
to
smile
when
milligan
said
this
neither
was
anyone
nervy
enough
to
question
the
courage
of
landis
it
looked
strange
that
sudden
flight
of
his
but
then
he
was
a
proven
man
everyone
remembered
the
affair
of
lester
it
had
been
a
fight
and
jack
landis
had
won
cleanly
on
his
merits
nevertheless
some
of
the
whispers
had
not
failed
to
come
to
the
big
man
and
his
brow
was
black
the
most
terribly
heartless
and
selfish
passion
of
all
is
shame
in
a
young
man
to
repay
the
sidelong
glances
which
he
met
on
every
side
jack
landis
would
have
willingly
crowded
every
living
soul
in
the
corner
into
one
house
and
touched
a
match
to
it
and
chiefly
because
he
felt
the
injustice
of
the
suspicion
he
had
no
fear
of
donnegan
he
had
a
theory
that
little
men
had
little
souls
not
that
he
ever
formulated
the
theory
in
words
but
he
vaguely
felt
it
and
adhered
to
it
he
had
more
fear
of
one
man
of
six
two
than
a
dozen
under
five
ten
he
reserved
in
his
heart
of
hearts
a
place
of
awe
for
one
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
that
was
for
lord
nick
for
that
celebrated
character
was
said
to
be
as
tall
and
as
finely
built
as
jack
landis
himself
but
as
for
donnegan
landis
wished
there
were
three
donnegans
instead
of
one
tonight
his
cue
was
surly
silence
for
nelly
lebrun
had
been
warned
by
her
father
and
she
was
making
desperate
efforts
to
recover
any
ground
she
might
have
lost
besides
to
lose
jack
landis
would
be
to
lose
the
most
spectacular
fellow
in
the
corner
to
say
nothing
of
the
one
who
held
the
largest
and
the
choicest
of
the
mines
the
blond
good
looks
of
landis
made
a
perfect
background
for
her
dark
beauty
with
all
these
stakes
to
play
for
nelly
outdid
herself
if
she
were
attractive
enough
ordinarily
when
she
exerted
herself
to
fascinate
nelly
was
intoxicating
what
chance
had
poor
jack
landis
against
her
he
did
not
call
for
her
that
night
but
went
to
play
gloomily
at
lebrun
until
nelly
walked
into
lebrun
and
drew
him
away
from
a
table
half
an
hour
later
she
had
him
whirling
through
a
dance
in
milligan
and
had
danced
the
gloom
out
of
his
mind
for
the
moment
before
the
evening
was
well
under
way
landis
was
making
love
to
her
openly
and
nelly
was
in
the
position
of
one
who
had
roused
the
bear
it
was
a
dangerous
flirtation
and
it
was
growing
clumsy
in
any
place
other
than
the
corner
it
would
have
been
embarrassing
long
ago
and
when
jack
landis
after
a
dance
put
his
one
big
hand
over
both
of
and
held
her
moveless
while
he
poured
out
a
passionate
declaration
nelly
realized
that
something
must
be
done
just
what
she
could
not
tell
and
it
was
at
this
very
moment
that
a
wave
of
silence
beginning
at
the
door
rushed
across
milligan
dance
floor
it
stopped
the
bartenders
in
the
act
of
mixing
drinks
it
put
the
musicians
out
of
key
and
in
the
midst
of
a
waltz
phrase
they
broke
down
and
came
to
a
discordant
pause
what
was
it
the
men
faced
the
door
wondering
and
then
the
swift
rumor
passed
from
lip
to
lip
almost
from
eye
to
eye
so
rapidly
it
sped
donnegan
is
coming
donnegan
and
big
george
with
him
someone
tell
milligan
but
milligan
had
already
heard
he
was
back
of
the
bar
giving
directions
guns
were
actually
unlimbering
what
would
happen
shall
i
get
you
out
of
this
landis
asked
the
girl
leave
now
she
laughed
fiercely
and
silently
i
just
beginning
to
live
miss
donnegan
in
action
no
sir
she
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
retract
that
sentence
for
it
washed
the
face
of
landis
white
with
jealousy
surely
donnegan
had
built
greater
than
he
knew
and
suddenly
he
was
there
in
the
midst
of
the
house
no
one
had
stopped
him
at
least
no
one
had
interfered
with
his
servant
big
george
had
on
a
white
suit
and
a
dappled
green
necktie
he
stood
directly
behind
his
master
and
made
him
look
like
a
small
boy
for
donnegan
was
in
black
and
he
had
a
white
neckcloth
wrapped
as
high
and
stiffly
as
an
stock
altogether
he
was
a
queer
drab
figure
compared
with
the
brilliant
donnegan
of
that
afternoon
he
looked
older
more
weary
his
lean
face
was
pale
and
his
hair
flamed
with
redoubled
ardor
on
that
account
never
was
hair
as
red
as
that
not
even
the
hair
of
lord
nick
said
the
people
in
milligan
this
night
he
was
perfectly
calm
even
in
the
midst
of
that
deadly
silence
he
stood
looking
about
him
he
saw
gloster
the
real
estate
man
and
bowed
to
him
deliberately
for
some
reason
that
drew
a
gasp
then
he
observed
a
table
which
was
apparently
to
his
fancy
and
crossed
the
floor
with
a
light
noiseless
step
big
george
padding
heavily
behind
him
at
the
little
round
table
he
waited
until
george
had
drawn
out
the
chair
for
him
and
then
he
sat
down
he
folded
his
arms
lightly
upon
his
breast
and
once
more
surveyed
the
scene
and
big
george
drew
himself
up
behind
donnegan
just
once
his
eyes
rolled
and
flashed
savagely
in
delight
at
the
sensation
that
they
were
making
then
the
face
of
george
was
once
again
impassive
if
donnegan
had
not
carried
it
off
with
a
certain
air
the
whole
entrance
would
have
seemed
decidedly
stagey
but
the
corner
as
it
was
found
much
to
wonder
at
and
little
to
criticize
and
in
the
west
grown
men
are
as
shrewd
judges
of
affectation
as
children
are
in
other
places
putting
on
a
lot
of
style
eh
said
jack
landis
and
with
fierce
intensity
he
watched
the
face
of
nelly
lebrun
for
once
she
was
unguarded
he
superb
she
exclaimed
the
big
fellow
is
going
to
bring
a
drink
for
him
she
looked
up
surprised
by
the
silence
of
landis
and
found
that
his
face
was
actually
yellow
i
tell
you
something
do
you
remember
the
little
tramp
who
came
in
here
the
other
night
and
spoke
to
me
very
well
you
seemed
to
be
bothered
maybe
i
dunno
but
that
the
man
the
one
who
sitting
over
there
now
all
dressed
up
the
man
the
corner
is
talking
about
donnegan
a
tramp
she
caught
her
breath
is
that
the
one
a
pause
well
i
believe
it
he
capable
of
anything
i
think
you
like
him
all
the
better
for
knowing
that
jack
you
angry
why
should
i
be
i
hate
to
see
you
fooled
by
the
bluff
of
a
tramp
though
tush
do
you
think
i
fooled
by
it
but
it
an
interesting
bluff
jack
do
you
think
nelly
he
interesting
enough
to
make
you
blush
by
heaven
the
hound
is
lookin
right
at
you
now
nelly
he
had
pressed
her
suddenly
against
the
wall
and
she
struck
back
desperately
in
by
the
way
what
did
he
want
to
see
you
about
it
spiked
the
guns
of
landis
for
the
time
being
at
least
and
the
girl
followed
by
striving
to
prove
that
her
interest
in
donnegan
was
purely
impersonal
he
clever
she
ran
on
not
daring
to
look
at
the
set
face
of
her
companion
see
how
he
fails
to
notice
that
he
making
a
sensation
you
think
he
was
in
a
big
restaurant
in
a
city
he
takes
the
drink
off
the
tray
from
that
fellow
as
if
it
were
a
common
thing
to
be
waited
on
by
a
in
the
corner
jack
i
wager
that
there
something
crooked
about
him
a
professional
gambler
say
jack
landis
thawed
a
little
under
this
careless
chatter
he
still
did
not
quite
trust
her
do
you
know
what
they
whispering
that
i
was
afraid
to
face
him
she
tilted
her
head
back
so
that
the
light
gleamed
on
her
young
throat
and
she
broke
into
laughter
why
jack
that
foolish
you
proved
yourself
when
you
first
came
to
the
corner
maybe
some
of
the
newcomers
may
have
said
something
but
all
the
know
you
had
some
different
reason
for
leaving
the
rest
of
them
by
the
way
what
was
the
reason
she
sent
a
keen
little
glance
at
him
from
the
corner
of
her
eyes
but
the
moment
she
saw
that
he
was
embarrassed
and
at
sea
because
of
the
query
she
instantly
slipped
into
a
fresh
tide
of
careless
chatter
and
covered
up
his
confusion
for
him
see
how
the
girls
are
making
eyes
at
him
i
tell
you
why
jack
replied
a
girl
likes
to
be
with
the
man
who
making
the
town
talk
he
added
pointedly
oh
i
found
that
out
she
shrugged
that
comment
away
he
is
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
any
of
them
she
murmured
he
queer
has
he
just
come
here
hunting
trouble
it
should
be
understood
that
before
this
the
men
in
milligan
had
reached
a
subtly
unspoken
agreement
that
donnegan
was
not
one
of
them
in
a
word
they
did
not
like
him
because
he
made
a
mystery
of
himself
and
also
because
he
was
different
yet
there
was
a
growing
feeling
that
the
shooting
of
lewis
through
the
hand
had
not
been
an
accident
for
the
whole
demeanor
of
donnegan
composed
the
action
of
a
man
who
is
a
professional
trouble
maker
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
go
to
milligan
and
take
his
servant
with
him
unless
he
wished
a
fight
and
why
a
man
should
wish
to
fight
the
entire
corner
was
something
no
one
could
guess
that
he
should
have
done
all
this
merely
to
focus
all
eyes
upon
him
and
particularly
the
eyes
of
a
girl
did
not
occur
to
anyone
it
looked
rather
like
the
bravado
of
a
man
who
lived
for
the
sake
of
fighting
now
men
who
hunt
trouble
in
the
mountain
desert
generally
find
all
that
they
may
desire
but
for
the
time
being
everyone
held
back
wolfishly
waiting
for
another
to
take
the
first
step
toward
donnegan
indeed
there
was
an
unspoken
conviction
that
the
man
who
took
the
first
step
would
probably
not
live
to
take
another
in
the
meantime
both
men
and
women
gave
donnegan
the
lion
share
of
their
attention
there
was
only
one
who
was
clever
enough
to
conceal
it
and
that
one
was
the
pair
of
eyes
to
which
the
man
was
playing
nelly
lebrun
she
confined
herself
strictly
to
jack
landis
so
it
was
that
when
milligan
announced
a
tag
dance
and
the
couples
swirled
onto
the
floor
gayly
donnegan
decided
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
and
offer
the
first
overt
act
it
was
clumsy
he
did
not
like
it
but
he
hated
this
delay
and
he
knew
that
every
moment
he
stayed
on
there
with
big
george
behind
his
chair
was
another
red
rag
flaunted
in
the
face
of
the
corner
he
saw
the
men
who
had
no
girl
with
them
brighten
at
the
announcement
of
the
tag
dance
and
when
the
dance
began
he
saw
the
prettiest
girls
tagged
quickly
one
after
the
other
all
except
nelly
lebrun
she
swung
securely
around
the
circle
in
the
big
arms
of
jack
landis
she
seemed
to
be
set
apart
and
protected
from
the
common
touch
by
his
size
and
by
his
formidable
challenging
eye
donnegan
felt
as
never
before
the
unassailable
position
of
this
fellow
not
only
from
his
own
fighting
qualities
but
because
he
had
behind
him
the
whole
unfathomable
power
of
lord
nick
and
his
gang
nelly
approached
in
the
arms
of
landis
in
making
the
first
circle
of
the
dance
floor
her
eyes
grown
dull
as
she
surrendered
herself
wholly
to
the
rhythm
of
the
waltz
saw
nothing
they
were
blank
as
unlighted
charcoal
she
came
opposite
donnegan
her
back
was
toward
him
she
swung
in
the
arms
of
landis
and
then
past
the
shoulder
of
her
partner
she
flashed
a
glance
at
donnegan
the
spark
had
fallen
on
the
charcoal
and
her
eyes
were
aflame
aflame
to
donnegan
the
next
instant
the
veil
had
dropped
across
her
face
once
more
she
was
carried
on
leaving
donnegan
tingling
a
wise
man
upon
whom
that
look
had
fallen
might
have
seen
not
nelly
lebrun
in
the
cheap
dance
hall
but
helen
of
sparta
and
all
troy
dead
but
donnegan
was
clever
not
wise
and
he
saw
only
nelly
lebrun
and
the
broad
shoulders
of
jack
landis
let
the
critic
deal
gently
with
donnegan
he
loved
lou
macon
with
all
his
heart
and
his
soul
and
yet
because
another
beautiful
girl
had
looked
at
him
there
he
sat
at
his
table
with
his
jaw
set
and
the
devil
in
his
eye
and
while
she
and
landis
were
whirling
through
the
next
circumference
of
the
room
donnegan
was
seeing
all
sides
of
the
problem
if
he
tagged
landis
it
would
be
casting
the
glove
in
the
face
of
the
big
man
and
in
the
face
of
old
lebrun
and
in
the
face
of
that
mysterious
and
evil
power
lord
nick
himself
and
consider
that
besides
these
he
had
already
insulted
all
of
the
corner
why
not
let
things
go
on
as
they
were
suppose
he
were
to
allow
landis
to
plunge
deeper
into
his
infatuation
suppose
he
were
to
bring
lou
macon
to
this
place
and
let
her
see
landis
sitting
with
nelly
making
love
to
her
with
every
tone
in
his
voice
every
light
in
his
eye
would
not
that
cure
lou
and
would
not
that
open
the
door
to
donnegan
and
remember
in
considering
how
donnegan
was
tempted
that
he
was
not
a
conscientious
man
he
was
in
fact
what
he
seemed
to
be
a
wanderer
a
careless
vagrant
living
by
his
wits
for
all
this
he
had
been
touched
by
the
divine
fire
a
love
that
is
greater
than
self
and
the
more
deeply
he
hated
landis
the
more
profoundly
he
determined
that
he
should
be
discarded
by
nelly
and
forced
back
to
lou
macon
in
the
meantime
nelly
and
jack
were
coming
again
they
were
close
they
were
passing
and
this
time
her
eye
had
no
spark
for
donnegan
yet
he
rose
from
his
table
reached
the
floor
with
a
few
steps
and
touched
landis
lightly
on
the
shoulder
the
challenge
was
passed
landis
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
his
head
his
face
showed
merely
dull
astonishment
the
current
of
dancers
split
and
washed
past
on
either
side
of
the
motionless
trio
and
on
every
face
there
was
a
glittering
curiosity
what
would
landis
do
nothing
he
was
too
stupefied
to
act
he
jack
landis
had
actually
been
tagged
while
he
was
dancing
with
the
woman
which
all
the
corner
knew
to
be
his
girl
and
before
his
befogged
senses
cleared
the
girl
was
in
the
arms
of
the
man
and
was
lost
in
the
crowd
what
a
buzz
went
around
the
room
for
a
moment
landis
could
no
more
move
than
he
could
think
then
he
sent
a
sullen
glance
toward
the
girl
and
retreated
to
their
table
a
childish
sullenness
clouded
his
face
while
he
sat
there
only
one
decision
came
clearly
to
him
he
must
kill
donnegan
in
the
meantime
people
noted
two
things
the
first
was
that
donnegan
danced
very
well
with
nelly
lebrun
and
his
red
hair
beside
the
silken
black
of
the
girl
was
a
startling
contrast
it
was
not
a
common
red
it
flamed
as
though
with
phosphoric
properties
of
its
own
but
they
danced
well
and
the
eyes
of
both
of
them
were
gleaming
another
thing
men
did
not
tag
donnegan
any
more
than
they
had
offered
to
tag
landis
one
or
two
slipped
out
from
the
outskirts
of
the
floor
but
something
in
the
face
of
donnegan
discouraged
them
and
made
them
turn
elsewhere
as
though
they
had
never
started
for
nelly
lebrun
in
the
first
place
indeed
to
a
child
it
would
have
been
apparent
that
nelly
and
the
chap
were
interested
in
each
other
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
did
not
speak
a
single
syllable
until
they
had
gone
around
the
floor
one
complete
turn
and
the
dance
was
coming
toward
an
end
it
was
he
who
spoke
first
gloomily
i
should
have
done
it
i
should
have
tagged
him
at
this
she
drew
back
a
little
so
that
she
could
meet
his
eyes
why
not
the
whole
crew
will
be
on
my
trail
what
crew
beginning
with
lord
nick
this
shook
her
completely
out
of
the
thrall
of
the
dance
lord
nick
what
makes
you
think
that
i
know
he
thick
with
landis
it
mean
trouble
he
was
so
simple
about
it
that
she
began
to
laugh
it
was
not
such
a
voice
as
lou
macon
it
was
high
and
light
and
one
could
suspect
that
it
might
become
shrill
under
a
stress
and
yet
it
looks
as
though
you
been
hunting
trouble
she
said
i
could
help
it
said
donnegan
naïvely
it
was
a
very
subtle
flattery
this
frankness
from
a
man
who
had
puzzled
all
the
corner
nelly
lebrun
felt
that
she
was
about
to
look
behind
the
scenes
and
she
tingled
with
delight
tell
me
she
said
why
not
well
said
donnegan
i
had
to
make
a
noise
because
i
wanted
to
be
noticed
she
glanced
about
her
every
eye
was
upon
them
you
made
your
point
she
murmured
the
whole
town
is
talking
of
nothing
else
i
do
care
an
ounce
of
lead
about
the
rest
of
the
town
then
she
stopped
abruptly
seeing
toward
what
he
was
tending
and
the
heart
of
nelly
lebrun
fluttered
for
the
first
time
in
many
a
month
she
believed
him
implicitly
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
had
made
all
this
commotion
to
draw
her
attention
for
every
lovely
girl
no
matter
how
has
a
foolish
belief
in
the
power
of
her
beauty
as
a
matter
of
fact
donnegan
had
told
her
the
truth
it
had
all
been
to
win
her
attention
from
the
fight
for
the
mint
to
the
tagging
for
the
dance
how
could
she
dream
that
it
sprang
out
of
anything
other
than
a
wild
devotion
to
her
and
while
donnegan
coldly
calculated
every
effect
nelly
lebrun
began
to
see
in
him
the
man
of
a
dream
a
spirit
out
of
a
dead
age
a
soul
of
knightly
reckless
chivalry
in
that
small
confession
he
cast
a
halo
about
himself
which
no
other
hand
could
ever
remove
entirely
so
far
as
nelly
lebrun
was
concerned
you
understand
he
was
saying
quietly
she
countered
with
a
question
as
direct
as
his
confession
what
are
you
mr
donnegan
a
wanderer
said
donnegan
instantly
and
an
avoider
of
work
at
that
they
laughed
together
the
strain
was
broken
and
in
its
place
there
was
a
mutual
excitement
she
saw
landis
in
the
distance
watching
their
laughter
with
a
face
contorted
with
anger
but
it
only
increased
her
unreasoning
happiness
donnegan
let
me
give
you
friendly
advice
i
like
you
i
know
you
have
courage
and
i
saw
you
meet
lewis
but
if
i
were
you
leave
the
corner
tonight
and
never
come
back
you
set
every
man
against
you
you
stepped
on
the
toes
of
landis
and
he
a
big
man
here
and
even
if
you
were
to
prove
too
much
for
jack
you
come
against
lord
nick
as
you
say
yourself
do
you
know
nick
no
then
donnegan
leave
the
corner
the
music
ending
left
them
face
to
face
as
he
dropped
his
arm
from
about
her
and
she
could
appreciate
now
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
smaller
than
he
had
seemed
at
a
distance
or
while
he
was
dancing
he
seemed
a
frail
figure
indeed
to
face
the
entire
banded
corner
and
lord
nick
do
you
see
said
donnegan
that
i
ca
stop
now
there
was
a
double
meaning
that
sent
her
color
flaring
he
added
in
a
low
tense
voice
i
gone
too
far
besides
beginning
to
hope
she
paused
then
made
a
little
gesture
of
abandon
then
stay
stay
she
whispered
with
eyes
on
fire
and
good
luck
to
you
mr
donnegan
as
they
went
back
toward
nelly
table
where
jack
landis
was
trying
to
appear
carelessly
at
ease
the
face
of
donnegan
was
pale
one
might
have
thought
that
excitement
and
fear
caused
his
pallor
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
in
him
an
unfailing
sign
of
happiness
and
success
landis
had
manners
enough
to
rise
as
they
approached
he
found
himself
being
presented
to
the
smaller
man
he
heard
the
cool
precise
voice
of
donnegan
acknowledging
the
introduction
and
then
the
man
went
back
to
his
table
and
jack
landis
was
alone
with
nelly
lebrun
again
he
scowled
at
her
and
she
tried
to
look
repentant
but
since
she
could
not
keep
the
dancing
light
out
of
her
eyes
she
compromised
by
looking
steadfastly
down
at
the
table
which
convinced
landis
that
she
was
thinking
of
her
late
partner
he
made
a
great
effort
swallowed
and
was
able
to
speak
smoothly
enough
looked
as
if
you
were
having
a
pretty
good
time
with
that
tramp
the
color
in
her
cheeks
was
anger
landis
took
it
for
shame
he
dances
beautifully
she
replied
yeh
he
pretty
smooth
take
a
gent
like
that
it
hard
for
a
girl
to
see
through
him
let
not
talk
about
him
jack
all
right
is
he
going
to
dance
with
you
again
i
promised
him
the
third
dance
after
this
for
a
time
landis
could
not
trust
his
voice
then
kind
of
sorry
about
that
because
i
be
going
home
before
then
at
this
she
raised
her
eyes
for
the
first
time
he
was
astonished
and
a
little
horrified
to
see
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
flustered
but
very
angry
you
go
home
before
i
have
a
chance
for
that
dance
she
asked
you
acting
like
a
jack
you
are
he
flushed
burning
would
be
too
easy
a
death
for
donnegan
he
making
a
laughingstock
out
of
me
look
around
the
room
nobody
thinking
about
you
at
all
jack
you
just
of
course
it
was
pouring
acid
upon
an
open
wound
but
she
was
past
the
point
of
caution
maybe
they
ai
said
landis
controlling
his
rage
i
do
figure
that
i
amount
to
much
but
i
rate
myself
as
high
as
a
skunk
like
him
it
may
have
been
a
smile
that
she
gave
him
at
any
rate
he
caught
the
glint
of
teeth
and
her
eyes
were
as
cold
as
steel
points
if
she
had
actually
defended
the
stranger
she
would
not
have
infuriated
landis
so
much
well
what
does
he
say
about
himself
he
says
frankly
that
he
a
vagrant
and
you
do
believe
him
she
did
not
speak
makin
a
play
for
sympathy
confound
a
man
like
that
i
say
still
she
did
not
answer
and
now
landis
became
alarmed
really
like
him
nelly
i
liked
him
well
enough
to
introduce
him
to
you
jack
i
sorry
i
talked
so
plain
if
you
put
it
that
way
he
admitted
heavily
i
did
know
you
picked
up
friends
so
fast
as
all
that
he
could
not
avoid
adding
this
last
touch
of
the
poison
point
his
back
was
to
donnegan
and
consequently
the
girl
facing
him
could
look
straight
across
the
room
at
the
man
she
allowed
herself
one
brief
glance
and
she
saw
that
he
was
sitting
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
his
chin
in
his
hand
looking
fixedly
at
her
it
was
the
gaze
of
one
who
forgets
all
else
and
wraps
himself
in
a
dream
other
people
in
the
room
were
noting
that
changeless
stare
and
the
whisper
buzzed
more
and
more
loudly
but
donnegan
had
forgotten
the
rest
of
the
world
it
seemed
it
was
a
very
cunning
piece
of
acting
not
too
much
overdone
and
once
more
the
heart
of
nelly
lebrun
fluttered
she
remembered
that
in
spite
of
his
frankness
he
had
not
talked
with
insolent
presumption
to
her
he
had
merely
answered
her
individual
questions
with
an
astonishing
childlike
frankness
he
had
laid
his
heart
before
her
it
seemed
and
now
he
sat
at
a
distance
looking
at
her
with
the
white
intense
face
of
one
who
sees
a
dream
nelly
lebrun
was
recalled
by
the
heavy
breathing
of
jack
landis
and
she
discovered
that
she
had
allowed
her
eyes
to
rest
too
long
on
the
stranger
she
had
forgotten
her
eyes
had
widened
and
even
jack
landis
was
able
to
look
into
her
mind
and
see
things
that
startled
him
for
the
first
time
he
sensed
that
this
was
more
than
a
careless
flirtation
and
he
sat
stiffly
at
the
table
looking
at
her
and
through
her
with
a
fixed
smile
nelly
horrified
strove
to
cover
her
tracks
you
right
jack
she
said
i
i
think
there
was
something
brazen
in
the
way
he
tagged
you
and
let
go
home
together
too
late
the
mind
of
landis
was
not
oversharp
but
now
jealousy
gave
it
a
point
he
nodded
his
assent
and
they
got
up
but
there
was
no
increase
in
his
color
she
read
as
plain
as
day
in
his
face
that
he
intended
murder
this
night
and
nelly
was
truly
frightened
so
she
tried
different
tactics
all
the
way
to
the
substantial
little
house
which
lebrun
had
built
at
a
little
distance
from
the
gambling
hall
she
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
steady
conversation
but
when
she
said
good
night
to
him
his
face
was
still
set
she
had
not
deceived
him
when
he
turned
she
saw
him
go
back
into
the
night
with
long
strides
and
within
half
an
hour
she
knew
as
clearly
as
if
she
were
remembering
the
picture
instead
of
foreseeing
it
that
jack
and
donnegan
would
face
each
other
gun
in
hand
on
the
floor
of
milligan
dance
hall
still
she
was
not
foolish
enough
to
run
after
jack
take
his
arm
and
make
a
direct
appeal
it
would
be
too
much
like
begging
for
donnegan
and
even
if
jack
forgave
her
for
this
interest
in
his
rival
she
had
sense
enough
to
feel
that
donnegan
himself
never
would
something
however
must
be
done
to
prevent
the
fight
and
she
took
the
straightest
course
she
went
as
fast
as
a
run
would
carry
her
straight
behind
the
intervening
houses
and
came
to
the
back
entrance
to
the
gaming
hall
there
she
entered
and
stepped
into
the
little
office
of
her
father
black
lebrun
was
not
there
she
did
not
want
him
in
his
place
there
sat
the
pedlar
and
joe
rix
they
were
members
of
lord
nick
chosen
crew
and
since
nick
temporary
alliance
with
lebrun
for
the
sake
of
plundering
jack
landis
nick
men
were
nelly
men
indeed
this
was
a
formidable
pair
they
were
the
kind
of
men
about
whom
many
whispers
and
no
facts
circulate
and
yet
the
facts
are
far
worse
than
the
whispers
it
was
said
that
joe
rix
who
was
a
fat
little
man
with
a
great
aversion
to
a
razor
and
a
pair
of
shallow
pale
blue
eyes
was
in
reality
a
merciless
fiend
he
was
and
he
was
more
than
that
if
there
be
a
stronger
superlative
if
lord
nick
had
dirty
work
to
be
done
there
was
the
man
who
did
it
with
a
relish
the
pedlar
on
the
other
hand
was
an
exact
opposite
he
was
long
lean
and
prodigiously
strong
in
spite
of
his
lack
of
flesh
he
had
vast
hands
all
loose
skin
and
outstanding
tendons
he
had
a
fleshless
face
over
which
his
smile
was
capable
of
extending
limitlessly
he
was
the
sort
of
a
man
from
whom
one
would
expect
shrewdness
some
cunning
stubbornness
a
dry
humor
and
many
principles
all
of
which
except
the
last
was
true
of
the
pedlar
there
was
this
peculiarity
about
the
pedlar
in
spite
of
his
broad
grins
and
his
wise
bright
eyes
none
even
of
lord
nick
gang
extended
a
friendship
or
familiarity
toward
him
when
they
spoke
of
the
pedlar
they
never
used
his
name
they
referred
to
him
as
him
or
they
indicated
him
with
gestures
if
he
had
a
fondness
for
any
living
creature
it
was
for
fat
joe
rix
yet
on
seeing
this
ominous
pair
nelly
lebrun
cried
out
softly
in
delight
she
ran
to
them
and
dropped
a
hand
on
the
bony
shoulder
of
the
pedlar
and
one
on
the
plump
shoulder
of
joe
rix
whose
loose
flesh
rolled
under
her
finger
tips
it
jack
landis
she
cried
he
gone
to
milligan
to
fight
the
new
man
stop
him
donnegan
said
joe
and
did
not
rise
him
said
the
pedlar
and
moistened
his
broad
lips
like
one
on
the
verge
of
starvation
are
you
going
to
sit
here
she
cried
what
will
lord
nick
say
if
he
finds
out
you
let
jack
get
into
a
fight
we
ai
nursin
mothers
declared
the
pedlar
but
i
kind
of
like
to
look
on
and
he
rose
unkinking
joint
after
joint
straightening
his
legs
his
back
his
shoulders
his
neck
he
soared
up
and
up
until
he
stood
a
prodigious
height
the
girl
controlled
a
shudder
of
disgust
joe
she
appealed
you
want
us
to
clean
up
donnegan
he
asked
rising
but
without
interest
in
his
voice
to
his
surprise
she
slipped
back
to
the
door
and
blocked
it
with
her
outcast
arms
not
a
hair
of
his
head
she
said
fiercely
swear
that
you
wo
harm
him
boys
what
the
devil
ejaculated
joe
who
was
a
blunt
man
in
spite
of
his
fat
you
want
us
to
keep
jack
from
fightin
but
you
do
want
us
to
hurt
the
other
gent
what
you
want
hogtie
both
yes
yes
keep
jack
out
of
milligan
but
for
heaven
sake
do
try
to
put
a
hand
on
donnegan
why
not
for
your
sakes
he
kill
you
joe
at
this
they
both
gaped
in
unison
and
as
one
man
they
drawled
in
vast
admiration
good
heavens
but
go
go
go
cried
the
girl
and
she
shoved
them
through
the
door
and
into
the
night
to
the
people
in
milligan
it
had
been
most
incredible
that
jack
landis
should
withdraw
from
a
competition
of
any
sort
and
though
the
girls
were
able
to
understand
his
motives
in
taking
nelly
lebrun
away
they
were
not
able
to
explain
this
fully
to
their
men
companions
for
one
and
all
they
admitted
that
jack
was
imperiling
his
hold
on
the
girl
in
question
if
he
allowed
her
to
stay
near
this
fiend
but
one
and
all
they
swore
that
jack
landis
had
ruined
himself
with
her
by
taking
her
away
and
this
was
a
paradox
which
made
masculine
heads
in
the
corner
spin
the
main
point
was
that
jack
landis
had
backed
down
before
a
rival
and
this
fact
was
stunning
enough
donnegan
however
was
not
confused
he
sent
big
george
to
ask
milligan
to
come
to
him
for
a
moment
milligan
at
this
cursed
george
but
he
was
drawn
by
curiosity
to
consent
a
moment
later
he
was
seated
at
donnegan
table
drinking
his
own
liquor
as
it
was
served
to
him
from
the
hands
of
big
george
if
the
first
emotions
of
the
proprietor
were
anger
and
intense
curiosity
his
second
emotion
was
that
surprise
which
all
who
came
close
to
the
wanderer
felt
for
he
had
that
rare
faculty
of
seeming
larger
when
in
action
even
when
actually
near
much
bigger
men
only
when
one
came
close
to
donnegan
one
stepped
as
it
were
through
a
veil
and
saw
the
almost
fragile
reality
when
milligan
had
caught
his
breath
and
adjusted
himself
he
began
as
follows
now
bud
he
said
you
made
a
pretty
play
not
bad
at
all
but
no
more
bluffs
in
milligan
bluff
donnegan
repeated
gently
about
your
servant
i
let
it
pass
for
one
night
but
not
for
another
my
dear
milligan
however
changing
the
subject
easily
what
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
is
a
bit
of
trouble
which
i
foresee
i
think
sir
that
jack
landis
is
coming
back
what
makes
you
think
that
it
a
feeling
i
have
i
have
queer
premonitions
milligan
sure
he
coming
and
i
sure
he
going
to
attempt
a
murder
milligan
thick
lips
framed
his
question
but
he
did
not
speak
fear
made
his
face
ludicrous
right
here
yes
a
shootin
scrape
here
you
he
has
me
in
mind
that
why
i
speaking
to
you
do
wait
to
speak
to
me
about
it
get
up
and
get
out
milligan
you
wrong
i
going
to
stay
here
and
you
going
to
protect
me
well
confound
your
soul
they
ai
much
nerve
about
you
is
there
you
run
a
public
place
you
have
to
protect
your
patrons
from
insult
and
who
began
it
then
who
started
walkin
on
jack
toes
now
you
come
whinin
to
me
by
heck
i
hope
jack
gets
you
you
a
genial
soul
said
donnegan
here
to
you
but
something
in
his
smile
as
he
sipped
his
liquor
made
milligan
sit
straighter
in
his
chair
as
for
donnegan
he
was
thinking
hard
and
fast
if
there
were
a
shooting
affair
and
he
won
he
would
nevertheless
run
a
close
chance
of
being
hung
by
a
mob
he
must
dispose
that
mob
to
look
upon
him
as
the
defendant
and
landis
as
the
aggressor
he
had
not
foreseen
the
crisis
until
it
was
fairly
upon
him
he
had
thought
of
nelly
playing
landis
along
more
gradually
and
carefully
so
that
while
he
was
slowly
learning
that
she
was
growing
cold
to
him
he
would
have
a
chance
to
grow
fond
of
lou
macon
once
more
but
even
across
the
width
of
the
room
he
had
seen
the
girl
fire
up
and
from
that
moment
he
knew
the
result
landis
already
suspected
him
landis
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
been
robbed
would
do
his
best
to
kill
the
thief
he
might
take
a
chance
with
landis
if
it
came
to
a
fight
just
as
he
had
taken
a
chance
with
lewis
but
how
different
this
case
would
be
landis
was
no
ruffian
and
drunkard
he
was
a
keen
boy
with
a
balance
and
in
a
gunplay
he
would
be
apt
to
beat
the
best
of
them
all
of
all
this
donnegan
was
fully
aware
either
he
must
place
his
own
life
in
terrible
hazard
or
else
he
must
shoot
to
kill
and
if
he
killed
what
of
lou
macon
while
he
smiled
into
the
face
of
milligan
perspiration
was
bursting
out
under
his
armpits
milligan
i
implore
you
to
give
me
your
aid
what
the
difference
milligan
asked
in
a
changed
tone
if
he
fight
you
here
he
fight
you
later
you
wrong
milligan
he
is
the
sort
to
hold
malice
come
here
tonight
and
try
to
get
at
me
like
a
bulldog
straining
on
a
leash
if
he
is
kept
away
he
get
over
his
bad
temper
milligan
pushed
back
his
chair
you
tried
to
force
yourself
down
the
throat
of
the
corner
he
said
and
now
you
yell
for
help
when
you
see
the
teeth
he
had
raised
his
voice
now
he
got
up
and
strode
noisily
away
donnegan
waited
until
he
was
halfway
across
the
dance
floor
and
then
rose
in
turn
gentlemen
he
said
the
quiet
voice
cut
into
every
conversation
the
musicians
lowered
the
instruments
i
have
just
told
milligan
that
i
am
sure
jack
landis
is
coming
back
here
to
try
to
kill
me
i
have
asked
for
his
protection
he
has
refused
it
i
intend
to
stay
here
and
wait
for
him
jack
landis
in
the
meantime
i
ask
any
man
who
will
do
so
to
try
to
stop
landis
when
he
enters
he
sat
down
raised
his
glass
and
sipped
the
drink
two
hundred
pairs
of
eyes
were
fastened
with
hawklike
intensity
upon
him
and
they
could
perceive
no
quiver
of
his
hand
the
sipping
of
his
liquor
was
not
an
affectation
for
he
was
drinking
at
incredible
cost
liquors
from
milligan
store
of
rareties
the
effect
of
donnegan
announcement
was
first
a
silence
then
a
hum
then
loud
voices
of
protest
curiosity
and
finally
a
scurrying
toward
the
doors
yet
really
very
few
left
the
rest
valued
a
chance
to
see
the
fight
beyond
the
fear
of
random
slugs
of
lead
which
might
fly
their
way
besides
where
such
men
as
donnegan
and
big
jack
landis
were
concerned
there
was
not
apt
to
be
much
wild
shooting
the
dancing
stopped
of
course
the
music
was
ordered
by
milligan
to
play
in
a
frantic
endeavor
to
rouse
custom
again
but
the
music
of
its
own
accord
fell
away
in
the
middle
of
the
piece
for
the
musicians
could
not
watch
the
notes
and
the
door
at
the
same
time
as
for
donnegan
he
found
that
it
was
one
thing
to
wait
and
another
to
be
waited
for
he
too
wished
to
turn
and
watch
that
door
until
it
should
be
filled
by
the
bulk
of
jack
landis
yet
he
fought
the
desire
and
in
the
midst
of
this
torturing
suspense
an
idea
came
to
him
and
at
the
same
instant
jack
landis
entered
the
doorway
he
stood
there
looking
vast
against
the
night
one
glance
around
was
sufficient
to
teach
him
the
meaning
of
the
silence
the
stage
was
set
and
the
way
opened
to
donnegan
without
a
word
big
george
stole
to
one
side
straight
to
the
middle
of
the
dance
floor
went
jack
landis
with
long
heavy
steps
he
faced
donnegan
you
skunk
shouted
landis
i
come
for
you
and
he
went
for
his
gun
donnegan
too
stirred
but
when
the
revolver
leaped
into
the
hand
of
landis
it
was
seen
that
the
hands
of
donnegan
rose
past
the
line
of
his
waist
past
his
shoulders
and
presently
locked
easily
behind
his
head
a
terrible
chance
for
landis
had
come
within
a
breath
of
shooting
so
great
was
the
impulse
that
as
he
checked
the
pressure
of
his
forefinger
he
stumbled
a
whole
pace
forward
he
walked
on
you
need
cause
to
fight
he
cried
striking
donnegan
across
the
face
with
the
back
of
his
left
hand
jerking
up
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
in
his
right
now
a
dark
trickle
was
seen
to
come
from
the
broken
lips
of
donnegan
yet
he
was
smiling
faintly
jack
landis
muttered
a
curse
and
said
sneeringly
are
you
afraid
there
were
sick
faces
in
that
room
men
turned
their
heads
for
nothing
is
so
ghastly
as
the
sight
of
a
man
who
is
taking
water
hush
said
donnegan
i
going
to
kill
you
jack
but
i
want
to
kill
you
fairly
and
squarely
there
no
pleasure
you
see
in
beating
a
youngster
like
you
to
the
draw
i
want
to
give
you
a
fighting
chance
besides
he
removed
one
hand
from
behind
his
head
and
waved
it
carelessly
to
where
the
men
of
the
corner
crouched
in
the
shadow
you
people
have
seen
me
drill
one
chap
already
and
i
like
to
shoot
you
in
a
new
way
is
that
agreeable
two
terrible
known
figures
detached
themselves
from
the
gloom
near
the
door
hark
to
this
gent
sing
said
one
and
his
name
was
the
pedlar
hark
to
him
sing
jack
and
we
see
that
you
get
fair
play
good
said
his
friend
joe
rix
let
him
take
his
try
jack
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
donnegan
reached
for
a
gun
he
would
have
been
shot
before
even
landis
could
bring
out
a
weapon
for
the
steady
eye
of
joe
rix
hidden
behind
the
pedlar
had
been
looking
down
a
revolver
barrel
at
the
forehead
of
donnegan
waiting
for
that
first
move
but
something
about
the
coolness
of
donnegan
fascinated
them
do
shoot
joe
the
pedlar
had
said
that
bird
is
the
chief
over
again
do
plug
him
and
that
was
why
donnegan
lived
if
he
had
taken
the
eye
of
the
hardened
rix
and
the
still
harder
pedlar
he
had
stunned
the
men
of
the
corner
and
breathlessly
they
waited
for
his
proposal
to
jack
landis
he
spoke
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
again
after
he
had
slowly
taken
out
a
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
chin
i
a
methodical
fellow
landis
he
said
i
hate
to
do
an
untidy
piece
of
work
i
have
been
disgusted
with
myself
since
my
little
falling
out
with
lewis
i
intended
to
shoot
him
cleanly
through
the
hand
but
instead
of
that
i
tore
up
his
whole
forearm
sloppy
work
landis
i
do
like
it
now
in
meeting
you
i
want
to
do
a
clean
neat
precise
job
one
that
i
be
proud
of
a
moaning
voice
was
heard
faintly
in
the
distance
it
was
the
pedlar
who
had
wrapped
himself
in
his
gaunt
arms
and
was
crooning
softly
with
unspeakable
joy
hark
to
him
sing
hark
to
him
sing
a
ringer
for
the
chief
why
should
we
be
in
such
a
hurry
continued
donnegan
you
see
that
clock
in
the
corner
tut
tut
turn
your
head
and
look
do
you
think
i
drop
you
while
you
look
around
landis
flung
one
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
big
clock
whose
pendulum
worked
solemnly
back
and
forth
in
five
minutes
said
donnegan
it
will
be
eleven
and
when
it
eleven
the
clock
will
chime
now
landis
you
and
i
shall
sit
down
here
like
gentlemen
and
drink
our
liquor
and
think
our
last
thoughts
heavens
man
is
there
anything
more
disagreeable
than
being
hurried
out
of
life
but
when
the
clock
chimes
we
draw
our
guns
and
shoot
each
other
through
the
heart
the
brain
wherever
we
have
chosen
but
landis
if
one
of
us
should
inadvertently
or
through
nervousness
beat
the
clock
chime
by
the
split
part
of
a
second
the
good
people
of
the
corner
will
fill
that
one
of
us
promptly
full
of
lead
he
turned
to
the
crowd
gentlemen
is
it
a
good
plan
as
well
as
a
roman
crowd
if
it
wanted
to
see
a
gladiator
die
the
frayed
nerves
of
the
corner
responded
to
the
stimulus
of
this
delightful
entertainment
there
was
a
joyous
chorus
of
approval
when
the
clock
strikes
then
said
landis
and
flung
himself
down
in
a
chair
setting
his
teeth
over
his
rage
donnegan
smiled
benevolently
upon
him
then
he
turned
again
and
beckoned
to
george
the
big
man
strode
closer
and
leaned
george
he
said
i
not
going
to
kill
this
fellow
no
sir
certainly
sir
whispered
the
other
george
can
kill
him
for
you
sir
donnegan
smiled
wanly
i
not
going
to
kill
him
george
on
account
of
the
girl
on
the
hill
you
know
and
the
reason
is
that
she
fond
of
the
lubber
i
try
to
break
his
nerve
george
and
drill
him
through
the
arm
say
no
i
take
chances
like
that
but
if
i
have
him
shaking
in
time
i
shoot
him
through
the
right
shoulder
george
but
if
i
miss
and
he
gets
me
instead
mind
you
never
raise
a
hand
against
him
if
you
so
much
as
touch
his
skin
i
rise
out
of
my
grave
and
haunt
you
you
hear
george
but
big
george
withdrew
without
a
word
and
the
reason
for
his
speechlessness
was
the
glistening
of
his
eyes
if
i
live
said
donnegan
i
show
that
george
that
i
appreciate
him
he
went
on
aloud
to
landis
so
glum
my
boy
tush
we
have
still
four
minutes
left
are
you
going
to
spend
your
last
four
minutes
hating
me
he
turned
another
liqueur
george
two
of
them
the
big
man
brought
the
drinks
and
having
put
one
on
the
table
of
donnegan
he
was
directed
to
take
the
other
to
landis
it
really
good
stuff
said
donnegan
i
not
an
expert
on
these
matters
but
i
like
the
taste
will
you
try
it
it
seemed
that
landis
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speech
as
though
a
vast
and
deadly
hatred
were
gathered
in
him
and
he
feared
lest
it
should
escape
in
words
the
first
time
he
parted
his
teeth
he
took
the
glass
of
liqueur
and
slowly
poured
it
upon
the
floor
from
the
crowd
there
was
a
deep
murmur
of
disapproval
and
landis
feeling
that
he
had
advanced
the
wrong
foot
in
the
matter
glowered
scornfully
about
him
and
then
stared
once
more
at
donnegan
just
as
you
please
said
donnegan
sipping
his
glass
but
remember
this
my
young
friend
that
a
fool
is
a
fool
drunk
or
sober
landis
showed
his
teeth
but
made
no
other
answer
and
donnegan
anxiously
flashed
a
glance
at
the
clock
he
still
had
three
minutes
three
minutes
in
which
he
must
reduce
this
stalwart
fellow
to
a
trembling
nervous
wreck
otherwise
he
must
shoot
to
kill
or
else
sit
there
and
become
a
certain
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
lou
macon
yet
he
controlled
the
muscles
of
his
face
and
was
still
able
to
smile
as
he
turned
again
to
landis
three
minutes
left
he
said
three
minutes
for
you
to
compose
yourself
landis
think
of
it
man
all
the
good
life
behind
you
have
you
nothing
to
remember
nothing
to
soften
your
mind
why
die
landis
with
a
curse
in
your
heart
and
a
scowl
on
your
lips
once
more
landis
stirred
his
lips
but
there
was
only
the
flash
of
his
teeth
he
maintained
his
resolute
silence
ah
murmured
donnegan
i
am
sorry
to
see
this
and
before
all
your
admirers
landis
before
all
your
friends
look
at
them
scattered
there
under
the
lights
and
in
the
shadows
no
farewell
word
for
them
nothing
kindly
to
say
are
you
going
to
leave
them
without
a
syllable
of
goodfellowship
confound
you
muttered
landis
there
was
another
hum
from
the
crowd
it
was
partly
wonder
partly
anger
plainly
they
were
not
pleased
with
jack
landis
on
this
day
donnegan
shook
his
head
sadly
i
hoped
he
said
that
i
could
teach
you
how
to
die
but
i
fail
and
yet
you
should
be
grateful
to
me
for
one
thing
jack
i
have
kept
you
from
being
a
murderer
in
cold
blood
i
kept
you
from
killing
a
defenseless
man
as
you
intended
to
do
when
you
walked
up
to
me
a
moment
ago
he
smiled
genially
in
mockery
and
there
was
a
scowl
on
the
face
of
landis
two
minutes
said
donnegan
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
yawned
for
a
whole
minute
he
did
not
stir
one
minute
he
murmured
inquisitively
and
there
was
a
convulsive
shudder
through
the
limbs
of
landis
it
was
the
first
sign
that
he
was
breaking
down
under
the
strain
there
remained
only
one
minute
in
which
to
reduce
him
to
a
nervous
wreck
the
strain
was
telling
in
other
places
donnegan
turned
and
saw
in
the
shadow
and
about
the
edges
of
the
room
a
host
of
drawn
tense
faces
and
burning
eyes
never
while
they
lived
would
they
forget
that
scene
and
now
that
the
time
is
close
said
donnegan
i
must
look
to
my
gun
he
made
a
gesture
how
it
was
no
one
was
swift
enough
of
eye
to
tell
but
a
gun
appeared
in
his
hand
at
the
flash
of
it
landis
weapon
leaped
up
to
the
mark
and
his
face
convulsed
but
donnegan
calmly
spun
the
cylinder
of
his
revolver
and
held
it
toward
landis
dangling
from
his
forefinger
under
the
guard
you
see
he
said
to
landis
clean
as
a
whistle
and
easy
as
a
smile
i
hate
a
stiff
action
jack
and
landis
slowly
allowed
the
muzzle
of
his
own
gun
to
sink
for
the
first
time
his
eyes
left
the
eyes
of
donnegan
and
sinking
inch
by
inch
stared
fascinated
at
the
gun
in
the
hand
of
the
enemy
thirty
seconds
said
donnegan
by
way
of
conversation
landis
jerked
up
his
head
and
his
eyes
once
more
met
the
eyes
of
donnegan
but
this
time
they
were
wide
and
the
pointed
glance
of
donnegan
sank
into
them
the
lips
of
landis
parted
his
tongue
tremblingly
moistened
them
keep
your
nerve
said
donnegan
in
an
undertone
you
hound
gasped
landis
i
knew
it
said
donnegan
sadly
you
die
with
a
curse
on
your
lips
he
added
ten
seconds
landis
and
then
he
achieved
his
third
step
toward
victory
for
landis
jerked
his
head
around
saw
the
minute
hand
almost
upon
its
mark
and
swung
back
with
a
shudder
toward
donnegan
from
the
crowd
there
was
a
deep
breath
and
then
landis
was
seen
to
raise
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
again
and
crouch
over
it
leveling
it
straight
at
donnegan
he
at
least
would
send
his
bullet
straight
to
the
mark
when
that
first
chime
went
humming
through
the
big
room
but
donnegan
he
made
his
last
play
to
shatter
the
nerve
of
landis
with
the
minute
hand
on
the
very
mark
he
turned
carelessly
the
revolver
still
dangling
by
the
trigger
guard
and
laughed
toward
the
crowd
and
out
of
the
crowd
there
came
a
deep
sobbing
breath
of
heartbreaking
suspense
it
told
on
landis
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
donnegan
saw
the
muscles
of
the
man
face
sag
and
tremble
saw
him
allow
his
gun
to
fall
in
imitation
of
donnegan
to
his
side
and
saw
the
long
arm
quivering
and
then
the
chime
rang
with
a
metallic
sharp
click
and
then
a
long
and
reverberant
clanging
with
a
gasp
landis
whipped
up
his
gun
and
fired
once
twice
again
the
weapon
crashed
and
to
the
eternal
wonder
of
all
who
saw
it
at
a
distance
of
five
paces
landis
three
times
missed
his
man
but
donnegan
sitting
back
with
a
smile
raised
his
own
gun
almost
with
leisure
unhurried
dropped
it
upon
the
mark
and
sent
a
slug
through
the
right
shoulder
of
jack
landis
the
blow
of
the
slug
like
the
punch
of
a
strong
man
fist
knocked
the
victim
out
of
his
chair
to
the
floor
he
lay
clutching
at
his
shoulder
gentlemen
said
donnegan
rising
is
there
a
doctor
here
that
was
the
signal
for
the
rush
that
swept
across
the
floor
and
left
a
flood
of
marveling
men
around
the
fallen
landis
on
the
outskirts
of
this
tide
donnegan
stepped
up
to
two
men
joe
rix
and
the
pedlar
they
greeted
him
with
expectant
glances
gentlemen
said
donnegan
will
you
step
aside
they
followed
him
to
a
distance
from
the
clamoring
group
i
have
to
thank
you
said
donnegan
for
what
for
changing
your
minds
said
donnegan
and
left
them
and
afterward
the
pedlar
murmured
with
an
oddly
twisted
face
joe
he
can
see
in
the
dark
but
i
told
you
he
was
worth
savin
speakin
in
general
said
joe
which
you
ai
hardly
ever
wrong
when
you
get
stirred
up
about
a
thing
he
something
new
the
pedlar
said
wisely
ay
he
rare
but
talkin
aside
suppose
he
was
to
meet
up
with
lord
nick
the
smile
of
joe
rix
was
marvelously
evil
you
got
a
great
mind
for
great
things
he
declared
you
ought
to
of
been
in
politics
in
the
meantime
the
doctor
had
been
found
the
wound
had
been
cleansed
it
was
a
cruel
one
for
the
bullet
had
torn
its
way
through
flesh
and
sinew
and
for
many
a
week
the
fighting
arm
of
jack
landis
would
be
useless
it
had
moreover
carried
a
quantity
of
cloth
into
the
wound
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
cleanse
the
hole
satisfactorily
as
for
the
bullet
itself
it
had
whipped
cleanly
through
at
that
short
distance
making
nothing
of
its
target
a
door
was
knocked
off
its
hinges
but
before
the
wounded
man
was
placed
upon
it
lebrun
appeared
at
the
door
into
milligan
he
was
never
a
very
cheery
fellow
in
appearance
and
now
he
looked
like
a
demoniac
he
went
straight
to
joe
rix
and
the
skeleton
form
of
the
pedlar
he
raised
one
finger
as
he
looked
at
them
i
heard
said
lebrun
lord
nick
likewise
shall
hear
joe
rix
changed
color
he
bustled
about
together
with
the
pedlar
and
lent
a
hand
in
carrying
the
wounded
man
to
the
house
of
lebrun
for
nelly
lebrun
was
to
be
the
nurse
of
landis
in
the
meantime
donnegan
went
up
the
hill
with
big
george
behind
him
already
he
was
a
sinisterly
marked
man
working
through
the
crowd
near
lebrun
gambling
hall
a
drunkard
in
the
midst
of
a
song
stumbled
against
him
but
the
sight
of
the
man
with
whom
he
had
collided
sobered
him
as
swiftly
as
the
lash
of
a
whip
across
his
face
it
was
impossible
for
him
in
that
condition
to
grow
pale
but
he
turned
a
vivid
purple
sorry
mr
donnegan
donnegan
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
passed
on
the
crowd
split
before
him
for
they
had
heard
his
name
there
were
brave
men
he
knew
among
them
men
who
would
fight
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
rather
than
be
shamed
but
they
shrank
from
donnegan
without
shame
as
they
would
have
shrunk
from
the
coming
of
a
rattler
had
their
feet
been
bare
so
he
went
easily
through
the
crowd
with
big
george
in
his
wake
walking
proudly
for
george
had
stood
to
one
side
and
watched
donnegan
indomitably
beat
down
the
will
of
jack
landis
and
the
sight
would
live
in
his
mind
forever
indeed
if
donnegan
had
bidden
the
sun
to
stand
in
the
heavens
the
big
man
would
have
looked
for
obedience
that
the
forbearance
of
donnegan
should
have
been
based
on
a
desire
to
serve
a
girl
certainly
upset
the
mind
of
george
but
it
taught
him
an
amazing
thing
that
donnegan
was
capable
of
affection
the
terrible
donnegan
went
on
in
his
wake
the
crowd
closed
slowly
for
many
had
paused
to
look
after
the
little
man
until
they
came
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
climbed
the
hill
toward
the
two
shacks
the
one
was
of
course
dark
but
the
shack
in
which
lou
macon
lived
burst
with
light
donnegan
paused
to
consider
this
miracle
he
listened
and
he
heard
voices
the
voice
of
a
man
laughing
loudly
thinking
something
was
wrong
he
hurried
forward
and
called
loudly
what
he
saw
when
he
was
admitted
made
him
speechless
colonel
macon
ensconced
in
his
invalid
chair
faced
the
door
and
near
him
was
lou
macon
lou
rose
by
the
unexpected
interruption
but
the
liquid
laughter
of
the
colonel
set
all
to
rights
at
once
come
in
donnegan
come
in
lad
said
the
colonel
i
heard
a
man
voice
donnegan
said
half
apologetically
the
sick
color
began
to
leave
his
face
and
relief
swept
over
it
slowly
i
thought
something
might
be
wrong
i
did
think
of
you
and
looking
down
as
all
men
will
in
moments
of
relaxation
from
a
strain
he
did
not
see
the
eyes
of
lou
macon
grow
softly
luminous
as
they
dwelt
upon
him
come
in
george
went
on
the
colonel
and
make
yourself
comfortable
in
the
kitchen
close
the
door
sit
down
donnegan
when
your
letter
came
i
saw
that
i
was
needed
here
lou
have
you
looked
into
our
friend
cabin
no
nothing
like
a
woman
touch
to
give
a
man
the
feeling
of
homeliness
lou
step
over
to
donnegan
cabin
and
put
it
to
rights
yes
i
know
that
george
takes
care
of
it
but
george
is
one
thing
and
your
care
will
be
another
besides
i
must
be
alone
with
him
for
a
moment
man
talk
confuses
a
girl
lou
you
should
listen
to
it
she
withdrew
with
that
faint
dreamy
smile
with
which
she
so
often
heard
the
instructions
of
her
father
as
though
she
were
only
listening
with
half
of
her
mind
when
she
was
gone
though
the
door
to
the
kitchen
stood
wide
open
and
big
george
was
in
it
the
colonel
lowered
his
bass
voice
so
successfully
that
it
was
as
safe
as
being
alone
with
donnegan
and
now
for
facts
he
began
but
said
donnegan
how
that
chair
how
in
the
world
have
you
come
here
the
colonel
shook
his
head
my
dear
boy
you
grieve
and
disappoint
me
the
manner
in
which
a
thing
is
done
is
not
important
mysteries
are
usually
simply
explained
as
for
my
small
mystery
a
neighbor
on
the
way
to
the
corner
with
a
wagon
stopped
in
and
i
asked
him
to
take
me
along
so
here
i
am
but
now
for
your
work
here
lad
bad
said
donnegan
i
gathered
you
had
been
unfortunate
and
now
you
have
been
fighting
you
have
heard
i
see
it
in
your
eye
donnegan
when
a
man
has
been
looking
fear
in
the
face
for
a
time
an
image
of
it
remains
in
his
eyes
they
are
wider
glazed
with
the
other
thing
it
was
forced
on
me
said
donnegan
i
have
shot
landis
he
was
amazed
to
see
the
colonel
was
vitally
affected
his
lips
remained
parted
over
his
next
word
and
one
eyelid
twitched
violently
but
the
spasm
passed
over
quickly
when
he
raised
his
perfect
hands
and
pressed
them
together
just
under
his
chin
he
smiled
in
a
most
winning
manner
that
made
the
blood
of
donnegan
run
cold
donnegan
he
said
softly
i
see
that
i
have
misjudged
you
i
underestimated
you
i
thought
indeed
that
your
rare
qualities
were
qualified
by
painful
weaknesses
but
now
i
see
that
you
are
a
man
and
from
this
moment
we
shall
act
together
with
open
minds
so
you
have
done
it
tush
then
i
need
not
have
taken
my
trip
the
work
is
done
the
mines
come
to
me
as
the
heir
of
jack
and
yet
poor
boy
i
pity
him
he
misjudged
me
he
should
not
have
ventured
to
this
deal
with
lord
nick
and
his
compatriots
wait
exclaimed
donnegan
you
wrong
landis
is
not
dead
once
more
the
colonel
was
checked
but
this
time
the
alteration
in
his
face
was
no
more
than
a
comma
pause
in
a
long
balanced
sentence
it
was
impossible
to
obtain
more
than
one
show
of
emotion
from
him
in
a
single
conversation
not
dead
well
donnegan
that
is
unfortunate
and
after
you
had
punctured
him
you
had
no
chance
to
send
home
the
finishing
shot
donnegan
merely
watched
the
colonel
and
tapped
his
bony
finger
against
the
point
of
his
chin
ah
murmured
the
colonel
i
see
another
possibility
it
is
almost
as
good
it
may
even
be
better
than
his
death
you
have
disabled
him
and
having
done
this
you
at
once
take
him
to
a
place
where
he
shall
be
under
your
surveillance
this
in
fact
is
a
very
comfortable
outlook
for
me
and
my
interests
but
for
you
donnegan
how
the
devil
do
you
benefit
by
having
jack
flat
on
his
back
sick
helpless
and
in
a
perfect
position
to
excite
all
the
sympathies
of
lou
now
donnegan
had
known
men
in
his
day
but
that
there
existed
such
a
man
as
the
colonel
had
never
come
into
his
mind
he
looked
upon
the
colonel
therefore
with
neither
disgust
nor
anger
but
with
a
distant
and
almost
admiring
wonder
for
perfect
evil
always
wins
something
akin
to
admiration
from
more
common
people
well
continued
the
colonel
a
little
uneasy
under
this
silent
scrutiny
silence
was
almost
the
only
thing
in
the
world
that
could
trouble
him
well
donnegan
my
lad
this
is
your
plan
is
it
not
to
shoot
down
landis
then
take
possession
of
him
and
while
i
nurse
him
back
to
health
hold
a
gun
metaphorically
speaking
to
his
head
and
make
him
do
as
i
please
sign
some
lease
say
of
the
mines
to
you
the
colonel
shifted
himself
to
a
more
comfortable
position
in
his
chair
brought
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
under
his
vast
chin
and
smiled
benevolently
upon
donnegan
it
is
as
i
thought
he
murmured
donnegan
you
are
rare
you
are
exquisite
and
you
said
donnegan
are
a
scoundrel
exactly
i
am
very
base
the
colonel
laughed
you
and
i
alone
can
speak
with
intimate
knowledge
of
me
his
chuckle
shook
all
his
body
and
set
the
folds
of
his
face
quivering
his
mirth
died
away
when
he
saw
donnegan
come
to
his
feet
eh
he
called
said
donnegan
but
where
landis
donnegan
what
devil
is
in
your
eye
a
foolish
devil
colonel
macon
i
surrender
the
benefits
of
all
my
work
for
you
and
go
to
make
sure
that
you
do
not
lay
your
hands
upon
jack
landis
the
colonel
opened
and
closed
his
lips
foolishly
like
a
fish
gasping
silently
out
of
water
it
was
rare
indeed
for
the
colonel
to
appear
foolish
in
heaven
name
donnegan
the
little
man
smiled
he
had
a
marvelously
wicked
smile
which
came
from
the
fact
that
his
lips
could
curve
while
his
eyes
remained
bright
and
straight
and
malevolently
unwrinkled
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
donnegan
cried
the
colonel
gray
of
face
give
me
one
minute
donnegan
stepped
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
he
took
out
his
watch
and
held
it
in
his
hand
studying
the
dial
and
the
colonel
knew
that
his
time
limit
was
taken
literally
i
swear
to
you
he
said
that
if
you
can
help
me
to
the
possession
of
landis
while
he
is
ill
i
shall
not
lay
a
finger
upon
him
or
harm
him
in
any
way
you
swear
said
donnegan
with
that
ugly
smile
my
dear
boy
do
you
think
i
am
reckless
enough
to
break
a
promise
i
have
given
to
you
the
cynical
glance
of
donnegan
probed
the
colonel
to
the
heart
but
the
eyes
of
the
fat
man
did
not
wince
neither
did
he
speak
again
but
the
two
calmly
stared
at
each
other
at
the
end
of
the
minute
donnegan
slipped
the
watch
into
his
pocket
i
am
ready
to
listen
to
reason
he
said
and
the
colonel
passed
one
of
his
strong
hands
across
his
forehead
now
and
he
sighed
i
feel
that
the
crisis
is
passed
with
a
man
of
your
caliber
donnegan
i
fear
a
snap
judgment
above
all
things
since
you
give
me
a
chance
to
appeal
to
your
reason
i
feel
safe
as
from
the
first
i
shall
lay
my
cards
upon
the
table
you
are
fond
of
lou
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
would
welcome
a
chance
to
brush
landis
out
of
your
path
it
appears
that
i
am
wrong
i
admit
my
error
only
fools
cling
to
convictions
wise
men
are
ready
to
meet
new
viewpoints
very
well
you
wish
to
spare
landis
for
reasons
of
your
own
which
i
do
not
pretend
to
fathom
perhaps
you
pity
him
i
can
not
tell
now
you
wonder
why
i
wish
to
have
landis
in
my
care
if
i
do
not
intend
to
put
an
end
to
him
and
thereby
become
owner
of
his
mines
i
shall
tell
you
frankly
i
intend
to
own
the
mines
if
not
through
the
death
of
jack
then
through
a
legal
act
signed
by
the
hand
of
jack
a
willing
signature
asked
donnegan
calmly
a
shadow
came
and
went
across
the
face
of
the
colonel
and
donnegan
caught
his
breath
there
were
times
when
he
felt
that
if
the
colonel
possessed
strength
of
body
as
well
as
strength
of
mind
even
he
donnegan
would
be
afraid
of
the
fat
man
willing
or
unwilling
said
the
colonel
he
shall
do
as
i
direct
without
force
listen
to
me
said
the
colonel
you
and
i
are
not
children
and
therefore
we
know
that
ordinary
men
are
commanded
rather
by
fear
of
what
may
happen
to
them
than
by
being
confronted
with
an
actual
danger
i
have
told
you
that
i
shall
not
so
much
as
raise
the
weight
of
a
finger
against
jack
landis
i
shall
not
but
a
whisper
adroitly
put
in
his
ear
may
accomplish
the
same
ends
he
added
with
a
smile
personally
i
dislike
physical
violence
in
that
donnegan
we
belong
to
opposite
schools
of
action
the
picture
came
to
donnegan
of
landis
lying
in
the
cabin
of
the
colonel
his
childish
mind
worked
upon
by
the
devilish
insinuation
of
the
colonel
truly
if
jack
did
not
go
mad
under
the
strain
he
would
be
very
apt
to
do
as
the
colonel
wished
i
have
made
a
mess
of
this
from
the
beginning
said
donnegan
quietly
in
the
first
place
i
intended
to
play
the
role
of
the
you
do
understand
i
did
expect
that
you
would
in
short
i
intended
to
send
landis
back
to
lou
by
making
a
flash
that
would
dazzle
the
corner
and
dazzle
nelly
lebrun
as
well
win
her
away
from
landis
you
see
but
the
fool
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
i
was
flirting
with
the
girl
lowered
his
head
and
charged
at
me
like
a
bull
i
had
to
strike
him
down
in
but
now
you
ask
me
to
put
him
wholly
in
your
possession
colonel
you
omit
one
link
in
your
chain
of
reasoning
the
link
is
important
to
me
what
am
i
to
gain
by
placing
him
within
the
range
of
your
whispering
tush
do
i
need
to
tell
you
i
still
presume
you
are
interested
in
lou
though
you
attempted
to
do
so
much
to
give
landis
back
to
her
well
donnegan
you
must
know
that
when
she
learns
it
was
a
bullet
from
your
gun
that
struck
down
landis
she
hate
you
my
boy
as
if
you
were
a
snake
but
if
she
knows
that
after
all
you
were
forced
into
the
fight
and
that
you
took
the
first
opportunity
to
bring
jack
into
my
er
paternal
care
her
sentiments
may
change
no
they
will
change
donnegan
left
his
chair
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
he
was
no
more
in
the
presence
of
the
colonel
than
a
man
might
be
in
the
presence
of
his
own
evil
instincts
and
it
was
typical
of
the
insight
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
influence
the
decision
of
donnegan
after
this
point
was
reached
he
allowed
him
to
work
out
the
matter
in
his
own
way
at
length
donnegan
paused
what
the
next
step
he
asked
the
colonel
sighed
and
by
that
sigh
he
admitted
more
than
words
could
tell
a
reasonable
man
he
said
is
the
delight
of
my
heart
the
next
step
donnegan
is
to
bring
jack
landis
to
this
house
tush
said
donnegan
bring
him
away
from
lebrun
bring
him
away
from
the
tigers
of
lord
nick
gang
i
saw
them
at
milligan
place
tonight
a
bad
set
colonel
macon
a
set
you
can
handle
said
the
colonel
calmly
ah
the
danger
will
in
itself
be
the
thing
that
tempts
you
he
went
on
to
go
among
those
fellows
wild
as
they
are
and
bring
jack
landis
away
to
this
house
bring
him
here
said
donnegan
with
indescribable
bitterness
so
that
she
may
pity
his
wounds
bring
him
here
where
she
may
think
of
him
and
tend
him
and
grow
to
hate
me
grow
to
fear
you
said
the
colonel
an
excellent
thing
to
accomplish
said
donnegan
coldly
i
have
found
it
so
remarked
the
colonel
and
lighted
a
cigarette
he
drew
the
smoke
so
deep
that
when
it
issued
again
from
between
his
lips
it
was
a
most
transparent
bluish
vapor
fear
came
upon
donnegan
not
fear
surely
of
the
fat
man
helpless
in
his
invalid
chair
but
fear
of
the
mind
working
ceaselessly
behind
those
hazy
eyes
he
turned
without
a
word
and
went
to
the
door
the
moment
it
opened
under
his
hand
he
felt
a
hysterical
impulse
to
leap
out
of
the
room
swiftly
and
slam
the
door
behind
him
to
put
a
bar
between
him
and
the
eye
of
the
colonel
just
as
a
child
leaps
from
the
dark
room
into
the
lighted
and
closes
the
door
quickly
to
keep
out
the
following
night
he
had
to
compel
himself
to
move
with
proper
dignity
when
outside
he
sighed
the
quiet
of
the
night
was
like
a
blessing
compared
with
the
ordeal
of
the
colonel
devilish
coldness
advice
had
seemed
almost
logical
the
moment
before
win
lou
macon
by
the
power
of
fear
well
enough
for
was
not
fear
the
thing
which
she
had
followed
all
her
life
was
it
not
through
fear
that
the
colonel
himself
had
reduced
her
to
such
abject
unquestioning
obedience
he
went
thoughtfully
to
his
own
cabin
and
in
his
musings
he
became
aware
with
a
start
of
lou
macon
in
the
hut
she
had
changed
the
room
as
her
father
had
bidden
her
to
do
just
wherein
the
difference
lay
donnegan
could
not
tell
there
was
a
touch
of
evergreen
in
one
corner
she
had
laid
a
strip
of
bright
cloth
over
the
rickety
little
table
and
in
ten
minutes
she
had
given
the
hut
a
semblance
of
permanent
livableness
donnegan
saw
her
now
with
some
vestige
of
the
smile
of
her
art
upon
her
face
but
she
immediately
smoothed
it
to
perfect
gravity
he
had
never
seen
such
perfect
in
a
woman
is
there
anything
more
that
i
can
do
she
asked
moving
toward
the
door
nothing
good
night
wait
she
still
seemed
to
be
under
the
authority
which
the
colonel
had
delegated
to
donnegan
when
they
started
for
the
corner
she
turned
and
without
a
word
came
back
to
him
and
a
pang
struck
through
donnegan
what
would
he
not
have
given
if
she
had
come
at
his
call
not
with
these
dumb
eyes
but
with
a
spark
of
kindliness
instead
she
obeyed
him
as
a
soldier
obeys
a
commander
there
has
been
trouble
said
donnegan
yes
she
said
but
there
was
no
change
in
her
face
it
was
forced
upon
me
then
he
added
it
amounted
to
a
shooting
affair
there
was
a
change
in
her
face
now
indeed
a
glint
came
in
her
eyes
and
the
suggestion
of
the
colonel
which
he
had
once
or
twice
before
sensed
in
her
now
became
more
vivid
than
ever
before
the
same
contemptuous
heartlessness
which
was
the
colonel
most
habitual
expression
now
looked
at
donnegan
out
of
the
lovely
face
of
the
girl
they
were
fools
to
press
you
to
the
wall
she
said
i
have
no
pity
for
them
for
a
moment
donnegan
only
stared
at
her
on
what
did
she
base
her
confidence
in
his
prowess
as
a
fighting
man
it
was
only
one
man
he
said
huskily
ah
there
he
had
struck
her
home
as
though
the
words
were
a
burden
she
shrank
from
him
then
she
slipped
suddenly
close
to
him
and
caught
both
his
hands
her
head
was
raised
far
back
she
had
pressed
close
to
him
she
seemed
in
every
line
of
her
body
to
plead
with
him
against
himself
and
all
the
veils
which
had
curtained
her
mind
from
him
dropped
away
he
found
himself
looking
down
into
eyes
full
of
fire
and
shadow
and
eager
lips
and
the
fiber
of
her
voice
made
her
whole
body
tremble
it
is
jack
she
pleaded
it
is
jack
that
you
fought
with
and
he
said
to
himself
she
loves
him
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
it
is
he
said
donnegan
in
an
agony
pain
may
be
like
a
fire
that
tempers
some
strong
men
and
now
donnegan
because
he
was
in
torment
smiled
and
his
eye
was
as
cold
as
steel
the
girl
flung
away
his
hands
you
bought
murderer
she
cried
at
him
he
is
not
dead
but
you
shot
him
down
he
attacked
me
it
was
she
broke
into
a
mirthless
laughter
where
was
the
girl
he
had
known
the
laughter
broke
off
short
like
a
sob
do
you
suppose
i
known
she
said
that
i
read
my
father
that
i
knew
he
was
sending
a
bloodhound
when
he
sent
you
but
oh
i
thought
you
had
a
touch
of
the
other
thing
he
cringed
under
her
tone
i
bring
him
to
you
said
donnegan
desperately
i
bring
him
here
so
that
you
can
take
care
of
him
you
take
him
away
from
lord
nick
and
lebrun
and
the
rest
and
it
was
the
cold
smile
of
her
father
with
which
she
mocked
him
i
do
it
you
play
a
deep
game
said
the
girl
bitterly
why
would
you
do
it
because
said
donnegan
faintly
i
love
you
her
hand
had
been
on
the
knob
of
the
door
now
she
twitched
it
open
and
was
gone
and
the
last
that
donnegan
saw
was
the
width
of
the
startled
eyes
as
if
i
were
a
leper
muttered
donnegan
by
heaven
she
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
unclean
but
once
outside
the
door
the
girl
stood
with
both
hands
pressed
to
her
face
stunned
when
she
dropped
them
they
folded
against
her
breast
and
her
face
tipped
up
even
by
starlight
had
donnegan
been
there
to
look
he
would
have
seen
the
divinity
which
comes
in
the
face
of
a
woman
when
she
loves
had
he
been
there
to
see
even
in
the
darkness
he
would
have
known
and
he
could
have
crossed
the
distance
between
their
lives
with
a
single
step
and
taken
her
into
his
heart
but
he
did
not
see
he
had
thrown
himself
upon
his
bunk
and
lay
face
down
his
arms
stretched
rigidly
out
before
him
his
teeth
set
his
eyes
closed
for
what
donnegan
had
wanted
in
the
world
he
had
taken
by
force
when
he
could
by
subtlety
when
he
must
and
now
what
he
wanted
most
of
all
was
gone
from
him
he
felt
forever
there
was
no
power
in
his
arms
to
take
that
part
of
her
which
he
wanted
he
had
no
craft
which
could
encompass
her
big
george
stealing
into
the
room
wondered
at
the
lithe
slender
form
of
the
man
in
the
bed
seeing
him
thus
it
seemed
that
with
the
power
of
one
hand
george
could
crush
him
but
george
would
as
soon
have
closed
his
fingers
over
a
rattler
he
slipped
away
into
the
kitchen
and
sat
with
his
arms
wrapped
around
his
body
as
frightened
as
though
he
had
seen
a
ghost
but
donnegan
lay
on
the
bed
without
moving
for
hours
and
hours
until
big
george
who
sat
wakeful
and
terrified
all
that
time
was
sure
that
he
slept
then
he
stole
in
and
covered
donnegan
with
a
blanket
for
it
was
the
chill
gray
time
of
the
night
but
donnegan
was
not
asleep
and
when
george
rose
in
the
morning
he
found
the
master
sitting
at
the
table
with
his
arms
folded
tightly
across
his
breast
and
his
eyes
burning
into
vacancy
he
spent
the
day
in
that
chair
it
was
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
george
came
with
a
scared
face
and
a
message
that
a
who
looks
riled
sir
wanted
to
see
him
there
was
no
answer
and
george
perforce
took
the
silence
as
acquiescence
so
he
opened
the
door
and
announced
lester
to
see
you
sir
into
the
fiery
haze
of
donnegan
vision
stepped
a
fellow
with
sandy
hair
and
a
disagreeably
strong
jaw
you
the
gent
that
here
with
the
colonel
ai
you
said
lester
donnegan
did
not
reply
you
the
gent
that
cleaned
up
on
landis
ai
you
continued
the
man
there
was
still
the
same
silence
and
lester
burst
out
it
do
work
donnegan
you
showed
you
several
ways
since
you
been
in
the
corner
now
i
come
to
tell
you
to
get
out
from
under
colonel
macon
why
because
he
crooked
because
we
know
he
crooked
because
he
played
crooked
with
me
you
hear
me
talk
still
donnegan
considered
him
without
a
word
we
goin
to
run
him
out
donnegan
we
want
you
on
our
side
if
we
can
get
you
if
we
ca
get
you
then
we
run
you
out
along
with
the
colonel
he
began
to
talk
with
difficulty
as
though
donnegan
stare
unnerved
him
he
even
took
a
step
back
toward
the
door
you
ca
bluff
me
out
donnegan
i
ai
alone
they
others
behind
me
i
do
need
to
name
no
names
here
another
thing
you
ai
alone
yourself
you
got
a
woman
and
a
cripple
on
your
hands
now
donnegan
you
a
fast
man
with
a
gun
and
you
a
fast
man
at
thinkin
but
i
ask
you
personal
have
you
got
a
chance
runnin
under
that
weight
he
added
fiercely
i
through
now
talk
turkey
donnegan
or
done
for
the
first
time
donnegan
moved
it
was
to
make
to
big
george
a
significant
signal
with
his
thumb
indicating
the
visitor
however
lester
did
not
wait
to
be
thrown
bodily
from
the
cabin
one
enormous
oath
exploded
from
his
lips
and
he
backed
sullenly
through
the
door
and
slammed
it
after
him
it
kind
of
looks
said
big
george
like
a
war
sir
and
still
donnegan
did
not
speak
until
the
afternoon
was
gone
and
the
evening
and
the
full
black
of
the
night
had
swallowed
up
the
hills
around
the
corner
then
he
left
the
chair
shaved
and
dressed
carefully
looked
to
his
revolver
stowed
it
carefully
and
invisibly
away
among
his
clothes
and
walked
leisurely
down
the
hill
an
outbreak
of
cursing
stamping
shooting
could
not
have
affected
big
george
as
this
quiet
departure
did
he
followed
unordered
but
as
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
of
the
hut
he
rolled
up
his
eyes
to
the
stars
oh
heavens
above
muttered
george
have
mercy
on
donnegan
he
ai
happy
and
he
went
down
the
hill
making
sure
that
he
was
fit
for
battle
with
knife
and
gun
he
had
sensed
donnegan
mental
condition
accurately
enough
the
heart
of
the
little
man
was
swelled
to
the
point
of
breaking
a
vigil
had
whitened
his
face
drawn
in
his
cheeks
and
painted
his
eyes
with
shadow
and
now
he
wanted
action
he
wanted
excitement
strife
competition
something
to
fill
his
mind
and
naturally
enough
he
had
two
places
in
mind
lebrun
and
milligan
it
is
hard
to
relate
the
state
of
donnegan
mind
at
this
time
chiefly
he
was
conscious
of
a
peculiar
and
cruel
pain
that
made
him
hollow
it
was
like
homesickness
raised
to
the
nth
degree
vaguely
he
realized
that
in
some
way
somehow
he
must
fulfill
his
promise
to
the
girl
and
bring
jack
landis
home
the
colonel
dared
not
harm
the
boy
for
fear
of
donnegan
and
the
girl
would
be
happy
for
that
very
reason
donnegan
wanted
to
tear
landis
to
shreds
it
is
not
extremely
heroic
for
a
man
tormented
with
sorrow
to
go
to
a
gambling
hall
and
then
to
a
dance
hall
to
seek
relief
but
donnegan
was
not
a
hero
he
was
only
a
man
and
since
his
heart
was
empty
he
wanted
something
that
might
fill
it
indeed
like
most
men
suffering
made
him
a
good
deal
of
a
boy
so
the
high
heels
of
donnegan
tapped
across
the
floor
of
lebrun
a
murmur
went
before
him
whenever
he
appeared
now
and
a
way
opened
for
him
at
the
roulette
wheel
he
stopped
placed
fifty
on
red
and
watched
it
double
three
times
george
at
a
signal
from
the
master
raked
in
the
winnings
and
donnegan
sat
at
a
faro
table
and
won
again
and
again
rose
disconsolately
and
went
on
for
when
men
do
not
care
how
luck
runs
it
never
fails
to
favor
them
the
devotees
of
fortune
are
the
ones
she
punishes
in
the
meantime
the
whisper
ran
swiftly
through
the
corner
donnegan
is
out
hunting
trouble
about
the
good
that
is
in
men
rumor
often
makes
mistakes
but
for
evil
she
has
an
infallible
eye
and
at
once
sets
all
of
her
thousand
tongues
wagging
indeed
any
man
with
half
an
eye
could
not
fail
to
get
the
meaning
of
his
fixed
glance
his
hard
set
jaw
and
the
straightness
of
his
mouth
if
he
had
been
a
ghost
men
could
not
have
avoided
him
more
sedulously
and
the
giant
servant
who
stalked
at
his
back
not
that
the
corner
was
peopled
with
cowards
the
true
westerner
avoids
trouble
but
cornered
he
will
fight
like
a
wildcat
so
people
watched
from
the
corner
of
their
eyes
as
donnegan
passed
he
left
lebrun
there
was
no
competition
luck
blindly
favored
him
and
donnegan
wanted
contest
excitement
he
crossed
to
milligan
rumor
was
there
before
him
a
whisper
conveyed
to
a
pair
of
that
they
were
sitting
at
the
table
which
donnegan
had
occupied
the
night
before
and
they
wisely
rose
without
further
hint
and
sought
other
chairs
milligan
hurried
to
the
orchestra
and
with
a
blast
of
sound
they
sought
to
cover
up
the
entry
of
the
gunman
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
blare
of
horns
only
served
to
announce
him
something
was
about
to
happen
the
eyes
of
men
grew
shadowy
the
eyes
of
women
brightened
and
then
donnegan
appeared
with
george
behind
him
and
crossed
the
floor
straight
to
his
table
of
the
night
before
not
that
he
had
forethought
in
going
toward
it
but
he
was
moving
indeed
he
had
half
forgotten
that
he
was
a
public
figure
in
the
corner
and
sitting
sipping
the
cordial
which
big
george
brought
him
at
once
he
let
his
glance
rove
swiftly
around
the
room
the
eye
of
more
than
one
brave
man
sank
under
that
glance
the
eye
of
more
than
one
woman
smiled
back
at
him
but
where
the
survey
of
donnegan
halted
was
on
the
face
of
nelly
lebrun
she
was
crossing
the
farther
side
of
the
floor
alone
unescorted
except
for
the
whisper
about
her
but
seeing
donnegan
she
stopped
abruptly
donnegan
instantly
rose
she
would
have
gone
on
again
in
a
flurry
but
that
would
have
been
too
pointed
a
moment
later
donnegan
was
threading
his
way
across
the
dance
floor
to
nelly
lebrun
with
all
eyes
turned
in
his
direction
he
had
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
in
his
black
clothes
with
his
white
stock
he
made
an
figure
as
he
bowed
before
the
girl
and
straightened
again
did
you
send
for
me
donnegan
inquired
nelly
lebrun
was
frankly
afraid
and
she
was
also
delighted
she
felt
that
she
had
been
drawn
into
the
circle
of
intense
public
interest
which
surrounded
the
stranger
she
remembered
on
the
other
hand
that
her
father
would
be
furious
if
she
exchanged
two
words
with
the
man
and
for
that
very
reason
she
was
intrigued
donnegan
being
forbidden
fruit
was
irresistible
so
she
let
the
smile
come
to
her
lips
and
eyes
and
then
laughed
outright
in
her
excitement
no
she
said
with
her
lips
while
her
eyes
said
other
things
i
come
to
ask
a
favor
to
talk
with
you
one
minute
if
i
should
what
would
people
say
let
find
out
it
would
be
daring
said
nelly
lebrun
after
last
night
it
would
be
delightful
said
donnegan
here
a
table
ready
for
us
she
went
a
pace
closer
to
it
with
him
i
think
you
frightened
the
poor
people
away
from
it
i
must
sit
down
with
you
mr
donnegan
and
she
immediately
slipped
into
the
chair
she
qualified
her
surrender
of
course
by
sitting
on
the
very
edge
of
the
chair
she
had
on
a
dress
and
with
the
excitement
whipping
color
into
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
dancing
nelly
lebrun
was
a
lovely
picture
i
must
go
at
once
said
nelly
of
course
i
ca
expect
you
to
stay
she
dropped
one
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
table
one
would
have
thought
that
she
was
in
the
very
act
of
rising
do
you
know
that
you
frighten
me
i
said
donnegan
with
appropriate
inflection
as
if
i
were
a
man
and
you
were
angry
but
you
see
and
he
made
a
gesture
with
both
of
his
palms
turned
up
people
have
slandered
me
i
am
harmless
the
minute
is
up
donnegan
what
is
it
you
wish
another
minute
now
you
laugh
at
me
no
no
and
in
the
next
minute
i
hope
to
persuade
you
to
stay
till
the
third
minute
of
course
i
ca
i
know
it
impossible
quite
she
settled
into
the
chair
see
how
people
stare
at
me
they
remember
poor
jack
landis
and
they
think
the
whole
crowd
a
crowd
is
always
foolish
in
the
meantime
i
happy
you
to
be
here
to
sit
close
to
you
to
watch
you
her
glance
was
like
the
tip
of
a
rapier
searching
him
through
for
some
iota
of
seriousness
under
this
banter
ah
and
nelly
lebrun
laughed
do
you
see
that
i
mean
it
you
can
watch
me
from
a
distance
mr
donnegan
may
i
say
a
bold
thing
you
have
said
several
no
one
can
really
watch
you
from
a
distance
she
canted
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
such
an
encounter
of
personal
quips
was
a
seventh
heaven
to
her
that
a
riddle
mr
donnegan
a
simple
one
the
answer
is
because
there
too
much
to
watch
he
joined
her
when
she
laughed
but
the
laughter
of
donnegan
made
not
a
sound
and
he
broke
in
on
her
mirth
suddenly
ah
do
you
see
i
serious
her
glance
flicked
on
either
side
as
though
she
feared
someone
might
have
read
his
lips
not
a
soul
can
hear
me
murmured
donnegan
and
i
going
to
be
bolder
still
and
tell
you
the
truth
it
the
last
thing
i
dare
stay
to
hear
you
are
too
lovely
to
watch
from
a
distance
nelly
lebrun
he
was
so
direct
that
even
nelly
lebrun
expert
in
flirtations
was
given
pause
and
became
sober
she
shook
her
head
and
raised
a
cautioning
finger
but
donnegan
was
not
shaken
because
there
is
a
glamour
about
a
beautiful
girl
he
said
gravely
one
has
to
step
into
the
halo
to
see
her
to
know
her
are
you
contented
to
look
at
a
flower
from
a
distance
that
an
old
comparison
is
it
but
there
is
something
like
a
fragrance
about
you
nelly
lebrun
do
be
afraid
no
one
can
hear
no
one
shall
ever
dream
said
such
bold
things
to
you
in
the
meantime
we
have
a
truth
party
there
is
a
fragrance
i
say
it
must
be
breathed
there
is
a
glow
which
must
touch
one
as
it
touches
me
now
you
see
indeed
there
was
a
faint
color
in
his
cheeks
and
the
girl
flushed
more
deeply
her
eyes
were
still
bright
but
they
no
longer
sharpened
to
such
a
penetrating
point
she
was
believing
at
least
a
little
part
of
what
he
said
and
her
disbelief
only
heightened
her
joy
in
what
was
real
in
this
strangest
of
lovemakings
i
shall
stay
here
to
learn
one
thing
she
said
what
deviltry
is
behind
all
this
talk
mr
donnegan
is
that
fair
to
me
besides
i
only
follow
a
beaten
trail
in
the
corner
and
that
toward
nelly
lebrun
a
beaten
trail
you
she
cried
with
just
a
touch
of
anger
i
not
a
child
mr
donnegan
you
are
not
and
that
why
i
am
frank
you
have
done
all
these
things
following
this
trail
you
speak
of
remember
said
donnegan
soberly
what
have
i
done
shot
down
two
men
played
like
an
actor
on
a
stage
a
couple
of
times
at
least
if
i
must
be
blunt
hunted
danger
like
like
a
reckless
madman
dared
all
the
corner
to
cross
you
flaunted
the
red
rag
in
the
face
of
the
bull
those
are
a
few
things
you
have
done
sir
and
all
on
one
trail
that
trail
you
spoke
of
nelly
lebrun
i
listening
and
do
you
know
i
persuading
myself
to
believe
you
it
because
you
feel
the
truth
before
i
speak
it
truth
speaks
for
itself
you
know
i
have
closed
my
eyes
you
see
i
have
stepped
into
a
masquerade
now
you
can
talk
masquerades
are
exciting
murmured
donnegan
and
they
are
sometimes
beautiful
but
this
sober
truth
of
mine
well
i
came
here
unknown
and
i
saw
you
nelly
lebrun
he
paused
she
was
looking
a
little
past
him
i
came
in
rags
no
friends
no
following
and
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
make
you
notice
me
and
why
no
i
should
have
asked
that
you
should
ask
that
agreed
donnegan
but
i
saw
you
the
queen
of
the
corner
worshiped
by
all
men
what
could
i
do
i
am
not
rich
i
am
not
big
you
see
he
drew
her
attention
to
his
smallness
with
a
flush
which
never
failed
to
touch
the
face
of
donnegan
when
he
thought
of
his
size
and
he
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
greater
in
the
very
instant
she
glanced
at
him
what
could
i
do
one
thing
fight
i
have
fought
i
fought
to
get
the
eye
of
the
corner
but
most
of
all
to
attract
your
attention
i
came
closer
to
you
i
saw
that
one
man
blocked
the
way
mostly
i
decided
to
brush
him
aside
how
by
fighting
she
had
not
been
carried
away
by
his
argument
she
was
watching
him
like
a
lynx
every
moment
not
by
that
by
bluffing
you
see
i
was
not
fool
enough
to
think
that
you
would
particularly
notice
a
fighting
bully
he
laid
his
open
hand
on
the
table
it
was
like
exposing
both
strength
and
weakness
and
into
such
a
trap
it
would
have
been
a
singularly
woman
who
might
not
have
stepped
nelly
lebrun
leaned
a
little
closer
she
forgot
to
criticize
it
was
bluff
i
saw
that
landis
was
big
and
and
what
was
i
beside
him
nothing
i
could
only
hope
that
he
was
hollow
yellow
you
see
so
i
tried
the
bluff
you
know
about
it
the
clock
and
all
that
claptrap
but
landis
was
yellow
he
did
crumble
he
lasted
long
enough
to
call
my
bluff
and
i
had
to
shoot
in
and
then
when
he
lay
on
the
floor
i
saw
that
i
had
failed
failed
he
lowered
his
eyes
for
fear
that
she
would
catch
the
glitter
of
them
i
knew
that
you
would
hate
me
for
what
i
had
done
because
i
had
only
proved
that
landis
was
a
brave
youngster
with
enough
nerve
for
nine
out
of
ten
and
i
came
tonight
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
no
not
that
only
to
ask
you
to
understand
do
you
he
raised
his
glance
suddenly
at
that
and
their
eyes
met
with
one
of
these
electric
shocks
which
will
go
tingling
through
two
people
and
when
the
lips
of
nelly
lebrun
parted
a
little
he
knew
that
she
was
in
the
trap
he
closed
his
hand
that
lay
on
the
table
curling
the
fingers
slowly
in
that
way
he
expressed
all
his
exultation
there
is
something
wrong
said
the
girl
in
a
tone
of
one
who
argues
with
herself
it
all
too
logical
to
be
real
ah
was
that
your
only
reason
for
fighting
jack
landis
do
i
have
to
confess
even
that
she
smiled
in
the
triumph
of
her
penetration
but
it
was
a
brief
unhappy
smile
one
might
have
thought
that
she
would
have
been
glad
to
be
deceived
i
came
to
serve
a
girl
who
was
unhappy
said
donnegan
her
fiancé
had
left
her
her
fiancé
was
jack
landis
and
she
now
in
a
hut
up
the
hill
waiting
for
him
and
i
thought
that
if
i
ruined
him
in
your
eyes
he
go
back
to
a
girl
who
would
care
so
much
about
bravery
who
forgive
him
for
having
left
her
but
you
see
what
a
fool
i
was
and
how
clumsily
i
worked
my
bluff
failed
and
i
only
wounded
him
put
him
in
your
house
under
your
care
where
he
be
happiest
and
where
never
be
a
chance
for
this
girl
to
get
him
back
nelly
lebrun
with
her
folded
hands
under
her
chin
studied
him
donnegan
she
said
i
wish
i
knew
whether
you
are
the
most
chivalrous
of
men
or
simply
the
most
gorgeous
liar
in
the
desert
and
it
hardly
fair
said
donnegan
to
expect
me
to
tell
you
that
it
gave
them
both
a
welcome
opportunity
to
laugh
welcome
to
the
girl
because
it
broke
into
an
excitement
which
was
rapidly
telling
upon
her
and
welcome
to
donnegan
because
the
strain
of
so
many
distortions
of
the
truth
was
telling
upon
him
as
well
they
laughed
together
one
hasty
glance
told
donnegan
that
half
the
couples
in
the
room
were
whispering
about
donnegan
and
nelly
lebrun
but
when
he
looked
across
the
table
he
saw
that
nelly
lebrun
had
not
a
thought
for
what
might
be
going
on
in
the
minds
of
others
she
was
quite
content
and
the
girl
she
said
donnegan
rested
his
forehead
upon
his
hand
in
thought
he
dared
not
let
nelly
see
his
face
at
this
moment
for
the
mention
of
lou
macon
had
poured
the
old
flood
of
sorrow
back
upon
him
and
therefore
when
he
looked
up
he
was
sneering
you
know
these
blond
pretty
girls
he
said
oh
they
are
adorable
with
dull
eyes
said
donnegan
coldly
and
a
twinkle
came
into
the
responsive
eye
of
nelly
lebrun
the
sort
of
a
girl
who
sees
a
hero
in
such
a
fellow
as
jack
landis
and
jack
is
brave
i
should
have
said
that
never
mind
brave
but
such
a
boy
are
you
serious
she
looked
questioningly
at
donnegan
and
they
smiled
together
slowly
i
i
glad
it
that
way
and
donnegan
sighed
and
did
you
really
think
it
could
be
any
other
way
i
did
know
i
afraid
i
was
blind
but
the
poor
girl
on
the
hill
i
wish
i
could
see
her
she
was
watching
donnegan
very
sharply
again
a
good
idea
why
do
you
you
seem
to
like
her
yes
said
donnegan
judiciously
she
has
an
appealing
way
i
very
sorry
for
her
but
i
done
my
best
i
ca
help
her
is
there
some
way
of
what
of
helping
her
donnegan
laughed
go
to
your
father
and
persuade
him
to
send
landis
back
to
her
she
shook
her
head
of
course
that
would
do
there
business
mixed
up
in
all
this
you
know
business
well
i
guessed
at
that
my
part
in
it
was
very
pleasant
she
remarked
sadly
donnegan
was
discreetly
silent
knowing
that
silence
extracts
secrets
they
made
me
flirt
with
poor
jack
i
really
liked
him
how
much
the
past
tense
may
mean
poor
fellow
murmured
the
sympathetic
donnegan
but
why
with
gathering
heat
could
you
help
me
to
do
the
thing
i
ca
do
alone
why
could
you
get
him
away
from
the
house
with
joe
rix
and
the
pedlar
guarding
him
they
be
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
night
but
jack
would
wake
up
and
make
a
noise
there
are
things
that
would
make
him
sleep
through
anything
but
how
could
he
be
moved
on
a
horse
litter
kept
ready
outside
and
how
carried
to
the
litter
i
would
carry
him
the
girl
looked
at
him
with
a
question
and
then
with
a
faint
smile
beginning
easily
said
donnegan
stiffening
in
his
chair
very
easily
it
pleased
her
to
find
this
weakness
in
the
pride
of
the
invincible
donnegan
it
gave
her
a
secure
feeling
of
mastery
so
she
controlled
her
smile
and
looked
with
a
sort
of
superior
kindliness
upon
the
little
man
it
no
good
nelly
lebrun
said
with
a
sigh
even
if
he
were
taken
away
and
then
it
would
get
you
into
a
bad
mess
would
it
worse
than
i
in
hush
lord
nick
is
coming
to
the
corner
and
no
matter
what
you
done
so
far
i
think
i
could
quiet
him
but
if
you
were
to
take
landis
away
then
nothing
could
stop
him
donnegan
sneered
i
begin
to
think
lord
nick
is
a
bogie
he
said
everyone
whispers
when
they
speak
of
him
he
leaned
forward
i
should
like
to
meet
him
nelly
lebrun
it
staggered
nelly
do
you
mean
that
she
cried
softly
i
do
she
caught
her
breath
and
then
a
spark
of
deviltry
gleamed
i
wonder
said
nelly
lebrun
and
her
glance
weighed
donnegan
all
i
ask
is
a
fair
chance
he
said
he
is
a
big
man
said
the
girl
maliciously
the
blush
burned
in
the
face
of
donnegan
a
large
target
is
more
easily
hit
he
said
through
his
teeth
her
thoughts
played
back
and
forth
in
her
eyes
i
ca
do
it
she
said
donnegan
played
a
random
card
i
was
mistaken
he
said
darkly
jack
was
not
the
man
i
should
have
faced
lord
nick
no
no
no
mr
donnegan
you
ca
persuade
me
well
i
was
a
fool
not
to
guess
it
i
really
think
said
the
girl
gloomily
that
as
soon
as
lord
nick
comes
you
hunt
him
out
he
bowed
to
her
with
cold
politeness
in
spite
of
his
size
said
donnegan
through
his
teeth
once
more
and
at
this
the
girl
face
softened
and
grew
merry
i
going
to
help
you
to
take
jack
away
she
said
on
one
condition
and
that
that
you
wo
make
a
step
toward
lord
nick
when
he
comes
i
shall
not
avoid
him
said
donnegan
you
unreasonable
well
not
avoid
him
but
simply
not
provoke
him
i
arrange
it
so
that
lord
nick
wo
come
hunting
trouble
and
he
let
jack
stay
with
the
girl
and
her
father
perhaps
he
persuade
them
to
let
him
go
of
their
own
free
will
donnegan
thought
of
the
colonel
and
smiled
in
that
case
of
course
i
should
care
at
all
he
added
but
do
you
mean
all
this
you
shall
see
they
talked
only
a
moment
longer
and
then
donnegan
left
the
hall
with
the
girl
on
his
arm
certainly
the
thoughts
of
all
in
followed
that
pair
and
it
was
seen
that
donnegan
took
her
to
the
door
of
her
house
and
then
went
away
through
the
town
and
up
the
hill
and
big
george
followed
him
like
a
shadow
cast
from
a
lantern
behind
a
man
walking
in
a
fog
in
the
hut
on
the
hill
donnegan
put
george
quickly
to
work
and
with
a
door
and
some
bedding
a
litter
was
hastily
constructed
and
swung
between
the
two
horses
in
the
meantime
donnegan
climbed
higher
up
the
hill
and
watched
steadily
over
the
town
until
in
a
house
beneath
him
two
lights
were
shown
he
came
back
at
that
and
hurried
down
the
hill
with
george
behind
and
around
the
houses
until
they
came
to
the
pretentious
cabin
of
the
gambler
lebrun
once
there
donnegan
went
straight
to
an
unlighted
window
tapped
and
it
was
opened
from
within
softly
nelly
lebrun
stood
within
it
done
she
said
joe
and
the
pedlar
are
sound
asleep
they
drank
too
much
your
father
has
come
home
and
jack
landis
no
matter
what
you
do
he
wo
wake
up
but
be
careful
of
his
shoulder
it
badly
torn
how
can
you
carry
him
she
could
not
see
donnegan
flush
but
she
heard
his
teeth
grit
and
he
slipped
through
the
window
gesturing
to
george
to
come
close
it
was
still
darker
inside
the
room
far
darker
than
the
starlit
night
outside
and
the
one
path
of
lighter
gray
was
the
bed
of
jack
landis
his
heavy
breathing
was
the
only
sound
donnegan
kneeled
beside
him
and
worked
his
arms
under
the
limp
figure
and
while
he
kneeled
there
a
door
in
the
house
was
opened
and
closed
softly
donnegan
stood
up
is
the
door
locked
no
whispered
the
girl
quick
too
late
it
father
and
he
hear
the
turning
of
the
key
they
waited
while
the
light
quick
step
came
down
the
hall
of
the
cabin
it
came
to
the
door
it
went
past
and
then
the
steps
retraced
and
the
door
was
opened
gently
there
was
a
light
in
the
hall
the
form
of
lebrun
was
outlined
black
and
jack
he
whispered
no
sound
he
made
as
if
to
enter
and
then
he
heard
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
sleeper
apparently
asleep
poor
fool
murmured
the
gambler
and
closed
the
door
the
door
was
no
sooner
closed
than
donnegan
had
raised
the
body
of
the
sleeper
once
as
he
rose
straining
it
nearly
slipped
from
his
arms
and
when
he
stood
erect
he
staggered
but
once
he
had
gained
his
equilibrium
he
carried
the
wounded
man
easily
enough
to
the
window
through
which
george
reached
his
long
arms
and
lifted
out
the
burden
you
see
said
donnegan
panting
to
the
girl
yes
it
was
really
wonderful
you
are
laughing
now
i
but
hurry
my
father
has
a
fox
ear
for
noises
he
will
not
hear
this
i
think
there
was
a
swift
scuffle
very
soft
of
movement
nelly
called
a
voice
hurry
hurry
do
you
hear
you
forgive
me
no
yes
but
hurry
you
will
remember
me
mr
donnegan
adieu
she
caught
a
picture
of
him
sitting
in
the
window
for
the
split
part
of
a
second
with
his
hat
off
bowing
to
her
then
he
was
gone
and
she
went
into
the
hall
panting
with
excitement
heavens
nelly
lebrun
murmured
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
hunted
and
i
must
look
it
what
if
he
whatever
the
thought
was
she
did
not
complete
it
it
may
have
been
for
the
best
added
nelly
lebrun
it
is
your
phlegmatic
person
who
can
waken
easily
in
the
morning
but
an
active
mind
readjusts
itself
slowly
to
the
day
so
nelly
lebrun
roused
herself
with
an
effort
and
scowled
toward
the
door
at
which
the
hand
was
still
rapping
yes
she
called
drowsily
this
is
nick
may
i
come
in
this
is
who
the
name
had
brought
her
instantly
into
complete
wakefulness
she
was
out
of
the
bed
had
slipped
her
feet
into
her
slippers
and
whipped
a
dressing
gown
around
her
while
she
was
asking
the
question
it
was
a
luxurious
little
boudoir
which
she
had
managed
to
equip
skins
of
the
lynx
cunningly
matched
had
been
sewn
together
to
make
her
a
rug
and
the
soft
fur
of
the
wildcat
was
the
outer
covering
of
her
bed
she
threw
back
the
tumbled
bedclothes
tossed
half
a
dozen
pillows
into
place
transforming
it
into
a
day
couch
and
ran
to
the
mirror
and
in
the
meantime
the
deep
voice
outside
the
door
was
saying
yes
nick
may
i
come
in
she
gave
a
little
ecstatic
cry
but
while
it
was
still
tingling
on
her
lips
she
was
winding
her
hair
into
shape
with
lightning
speed
had
dipped
the
tips
of
her
fingers
in
cold
water
and
rubbed
her
eyes
awake
and
brilliant
and
with
one
circular
rub
had
brought
the
color
into
her
cheeks
scarcely
ten
seconds
from
the
time
when
she
first
answered
the
knock
nelly
was
opening
the
door
and
peeping
out
into
the
hall
the
rest
was
done
by
the
man
without
he
cast
the
door
open
with
the
pressure
of
his
foot
caught
the
girl
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
while
he
closed
the
door
the
girl
slipped
back
and
stood
with
one
hand
pressed
against
her
face
and
her
face
held
that
delightful
expression
halfway
between
laughter
and
embarrassment
as
for
lord
nick
he
did
not
even
smile
he
was
not
in
fact
a
man
who
was
prone
to
gentle
expressions
but
having
been
framed
by
nature
for
a
strong
dominance
over
all
around
him
his
habitual
expression
was
a
proud
it
would
have
been
insolence
in
another
man
in
lord
nick
it
was
rather
leonine
he
was
fully
as
tall
as
jack
landis
but
he
carried
his
height
easily
and
was
so
perfectly
proportioned
that
unless
he
was
seen
beside
another
man
he
did
not
look
large
the
breadth
of
his
shoulders
was
concealed
by
the
depth
of
his
chest
and
the
girth
of
his
throat
was
made
to
appear
quite
normal
by
the
lordly
size
of
the
head
it
supported
to
crown
and
set
off
his
magnificent
body
there
was
a
handsome
face
and
he
had
the
combination
of
active
eyes
and
red
hair
which
was
noticeable
in
donnegan
too
in
fact
there
was
a
certain
resemblance
between
the
two
men
in
the
set
of
the
jaw
for
instance
in
the
gleam
of
the
eye
and
above
all
in
an
indescribable
ardor
of
spirit
which
exuded
from
them
both
except
of
course
that
in
donnegan
one
was
conscious
of
all
spirit
and
very
little
body
but
in
lord
nick
hand
and
eye
were
terribly
mated
looking
upon
so
splendid
a
figure
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
mountain
desert
had
forgiven
the
crimes
of
lord
nick
because
of
the
careless
insolence
with
which
he
treated
the
law
it
requires
an
exceptional
man
to
make
a
legal
life
attractive
and
respected
it
takes
a
genius
to
make
glorious
no
wonder
that
nelly
lebrun
stood
with
her
hand
against
her
cheek
looking
him
over
smiling
happily
at
him
and
questioning
him
about
his
immediate
past
all
in
the
same
glance
he
waved
her
back
to
her
couch
and
she
hesitated
then
as
though
she
remembered
that
she
now
had
to
do
with
lord
nick
in
person
she
obediently
curled
up
on
the
lounge
and
waited
expectantly
i
hear
you
been
raising
the
devil
said
this
singularly
frank
admirer
the
girl
merely
looked
at
him
well
he
insisted
i
have
done
a
thing
protested
nelly
rather
childishly
no
one
felt
that
he
could
have
crushed
her
with
evidence
to
the
contrary
but
that
he
was
restraining
himself
it
was
not
worthwhile
to
bother
with
such
a
girl
seriously
things
have
fallen
into
a
tangle
since
i
left
old
satan
macon
is
on
the
spot
and
your
rat
of
a
father
has
let
landis
get
away
what
have
you
been
doing
nelly
while
all
this
was
going
on
sitting
with
your
eyes
closed
he
took
a
chair
and
lounged
back
in
it
gracefully
how
could
i
help
it
i
not
a
watchdog
he
was
silent
for
a
time
well
he
said
if
you
told
me
the
truth
i
suppose
i
should
love
you
my
girl
but
this
time
i
in
earnest
landis
is
a
mint
silly
child
if
we
let
him
go
we
lose
the
mint
i
suppose
you
get
him
back
first
i
want
to
find
out
how
he
got
away
i
know
how
ah
donnegan
donnegan
donnegan
donnegan
burst
out
lord
nick
and
though
he
did
not
raise
the
pitch
of
his
voice
he
allowed
its
volume
to
swell
softly
so
that
it
filled
the
room
like
the
humming
of
a
great
angry
tiger
nobody
says
three
words
without
putting
in
the
name
of
donnegan
as
one
of
them
you
too
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
donnegan
thrills
the
corner
went
on
the
big
man
in
the
same
terrible
voice
donnegan
wears
queer
clothes
donnegan
shoots
lewis
donnegan
pumps
the
nerve
out
of
poor
jack
landis
and
then
drills
him
why
nelly
it
looks
as
though
i
have
to
kill
this
intruding
fool
she
blanched
at
this
but
did
not
appear
to
notice
it
a
long
time
since
you
killed
a
man
is
it
she
asked
coldly
it
an
awful
business
declared
lord
nick
always
complications
have
to
throw
the
blame
on
the
other
fellow
and
even
these
blockheads
are
beginning
to
get
tired
of
my
pleas
well
murmured
the
girl
do
cross
that
bridge
until
you
come
to
it
and
you
never
come
to
it
never
because
i
do
want
him
killed
ah
lord
nick
murmured
and
why
because
he
in
love
with
me
tush
said
lord
nick
i
see
you
my
dear
donnegan
seems
to
be
a
rare
fellow
but
he
could
have
gotten
landis
out
of
this
house
without
help
rix
and
the
pedlar
may
have
been
a
bit
sleepy
but
donnegan
had
to
find
out
when
they
fell
asleep
he
had
a
confederate
who
not
rix
not
the
pedlar
not
lebrun
they
all
know
me
it
had
to
be
someone
who
does
fear
me
who
only
one
person
in
the
world
nelly
you
the
one
she
hesitated
a
breathless
instant
yes
she
said
i
am
she
added
as
he
stared
calmly
at
her
considering
there
a
girl
in
the
case
she
came
up
here
to
get
landis
seems
he
was
in
love
with
her
once
and
i
pitied
her
i
sent
him
back
to
her
suppose
he
is
a
mint
have
we
coined
enough
money
out
of
him
besides
i
could
have
kept
on
with
it
no
he
was
getting
violent
and
he
talked
marriage
all
day
every
day
i
have
any
nerves
you
say
but
he
began
to
put
me
on
edge
so
i
got
rid
of
him
nelly
are
you
growing
a
conscience
she
flushed
and
then
set
her
teeth
but
i
have
to
teach
you
business
methods
my
dear
i
have
to
bring
him
back
you
have
to
go
through
donnegan
to
do
it
i
suppose
so
you
do
understand
nick
he
different
eh
he
like
you
what
are
you
driving
at
nick
i
tell
you
upon
my
word
of
honor
no
matter
what
a
terrible
fighter
you
may
be
donnegan
will
give
you
trouble
he
has
your
hair
and
your
eyes
and
he
moves
like
a
cat
i
never
seen
such
a
man
except
you
i
rather
see
you
fight
the
plague
than
fight
donnegan
for
the
first
time
lord
nick
showed
real
emotion
he
leaned
a
little
forward
just
what
does
he
mean
to
you
he
asked
i
stood
for
a
good
deal
nelly
i
given
you
absolute
freedom
but
if
i
ever
suspect
you
the
lion
was
up
in
him
unmistakably
now
and
the
girl
shrank
if
it
were
serious
do
you
suppose
i
talk
like
this
i
do
know
you
a
clever
little
devil
nell
but
i
clever
too
and
i
begin
to
see
through
you
do
you
still
want
to
save
donnegan
for
your
own
sake
he
stood
up
i
going
up
the
hill
today
if
donnegan
there
i
go
through
him
but
i
going
to
have
landis
back
she
also
rose
there
only
one
way
out
and
i
take
that
way
i
get
donnegan
to
leave
the
house
i
do
care
what
you
do
about
that
and
if
he
is
there
will
you
give
me
your
word
that
you
wo
hunt
him
out
afterward
i
never
make
promises
nell
but
i
trust
you
nick
very
well
i
start
up
the
hill
in
an
hour
you
have
that
long
the
air
was
thin
and
chilly
snow
had
fallen
in
the
mountains
to
the
north
and
the
wind
was
bringing
the
cold
down
to
the
corner
nelly
lebrun
noted
this
as
she
dressed
and
made
up
her
mind
accordingly
she
sent
out
two
messages
one
to
the
cook
to
send
breakfast
to
her
room
which
she
ate
while
she
finished
dressing
with
care
and
the
other
to
the
gambling
house
summoning
one
of
the
waiters
when
he
came
she
gave
him
a
note
for
donnegan
the
fellow
flashed
a
glance
at
her
as
he
took
the
envelope
there
was
no
need
to
give
that
name
and
address
in
the
corner
and
the
girl
tingled
under
the
glance
she
finished
her
breakfast
and
then
concentrated
in
polishing
up
her
appearance
from
all
of
which
it
may
be
gathered
that
nelly
lebrun
was
in
love
with
donnegan
but
she
really
was
not
but
he
had
touched
in
her
that
cord
of
romance
which
runs
through
every
woman
whenever
it
is
touched
the
vibration
is
music
and
nelly
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
it
and
except
for
lord
nick
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
would
have
really
lost
her
head
for
she
kept
seeing
the
face
of
donnegan
as
he
had
leaned
toward
her
across
the
little
table
in
milligan
and
that
as
anyone
may
know
is
a
dangerous
symptom
her
glances
were
alternating
between
her
mirror
and
her
watch
and
the
hands
of
the
latter
pointed
to
the
fact
that
fifty
minutes
of
her
hour
had
elapsed
when
a
message
came
up
that
she
was
waited
for
in
the
street
below
so
nelly
lebrun
went
down
in
her
riding
costume
the
corduroy
swishing
at
each
step
and
tapping
her
shining
boots
with
the
riding
crop
her
own
horse
she
found
at
the
hitching
rack
and
beside
it
donnegan
was
on
his
chestnut
horse
it
was
a
tall
horse
and
he
looked
more
diminutive
than
ever
before
pitched
so
high
in
the
saddle
he
was
on
the
ground
in
a
flash
with
the
reins
tucked
under
one
arm
and
his
hat
under
the
other
she
became
aware
of
gloves
and
stock
and
pale
narrow
face
truly
donnegan
made
a
natty
appearance
there
no
day
like
a
cool
day
for
riding
she
said
and
i
thought
you
might
agree
with
me
he
untethered
her
horse
while
he
murmured
an
answer
but
for
his
attitude
she
cared
little
so
long
as
she
had
him
riding
away
from
that
house
on
the
hill
where
lord
nick
in
all
his
terror
would
appear
in
some
few
minutes
besides
as
they
swung
up
the
road
the
chestnut
at
a
canter
and
nelly
black
at
a
soft
and
choppy
pace
the
wind
of
the
gallop
struck
into
her
face
nelly
was
made
to
enjoy
things
one
by
one
and
not
two
by
two
they
hit
over
the
hills
and
when
the
first
impulse
of
the
ride
was
done
they
were
a
mile
or
more
away
from
the
corner
and
lord
nick
the
resemblance
between
the
two
men
was
less
striking
now
that
she
had
donnegan
beside
her
he
seemed
more
wizened
paler
and
intense
as
a
violin
string
screwed
to
the
snapping
point
there
was
none
of
the
lordly
tolerance
of
nick
about
him
he
was
like
a
bull
terrier
compared
with
a
stag
hound
and
only
the
color
of
his
eyes
and
his
hair
made
her
make
the
comparison
at
all
what
could
be
better
she
said
when
they
checked
their
horses
on
a
hilltop
to
look
over
a
gradual
falling
of
the
ground
below
what
could
be
better
the
wind
flattened
a
loose
curl
of
hair
against
her
cheek
and
overhead
the
wild
geese
were
flying
and
crying
small
and
far
away
one
thing
better
said
donnegan
and
that
is
to
sit
in
a
chair
and
see
this
she
frowned
at
such
frankness
it
was
almost
blunt
discourtesy
you
see
i
a
lazy
man
how
long
has
it
been
the
girl
asked
sharply
since
you
have
slept
two
days
i
think
what
wrong
he
lifted
his
eyes
slowly
from
a
glittering
distant
rock
and
brought
his
glance
toward
her
by
degrees
he
had
a
way
of
exciting
people
even
in
the
most
commonplace
conversation
and
the
girl
felt
a
thrill
under
his
look
that
said
donnegan
is
a
dangerous
question
and
he
allowed
such
hunger
to
come
into
his
eye
that
she
caught
her
breath
the
imp
of
perversity
made
her
go
on
and
why
dangerous
it
was
an
excellent
excuse
for
an
outpouring
of
the
heart
from
donnegan
but
instead
his
eyes
twinkled
at
her
you
are
not
frank
he
remarked
she
could
not
help
laughing
and
her
laughter
trailed
away
musically
in
her
excitement
having
once
let
down
the
bars
i
can
not
keep
you
at
arm
length
after
last
night
i
suppose
i
should
never
have
let
you
see
me
for
days
and
days
that
why
i
curious
said
donnegan
and
not
flattered
i
trying
to
find
what
purpose
you
have
in
taking
me
riding
i
wonder
she
said
thoughtfully
if
you
will
and
since
such
fencing
with
the
wits
delighted
her
she
let
all
her
delight
come
with
a
sparkle
in
her
eyes
i
have
one
clue
yes
and
that
is
that
you
may
have
the
curiosity
to
find
out
how
many
ways
a
man
can
tell
her
that
he
fond
of
her
though
she
flushed
a
little
she
kept
her
poise
admirably
i
suppose
that
is
part
of
my
interest
she
admitted
i
can
think
of
a
great
many
ways
of
saying
it
said
donnegan
i
am
the
dry
desert
you
are
the
rain
and
yet
i
remain
dry
and
produce
no
grass
a
very
pretty
comparison
said
the
girl
with
a
smile
a
very
green
one
and
donnegan
smiled
i
am
the
wind
and
you
are
the
wild
geese
and
yet
i
keep
on
blowing
after
you
are
gone
and
do
not
carry
away
a
feather
of
you
pretty
again
and
silly
but
really
you
are
very
kind
to
me
and
i
shall
try
not
to
take
too
much
advantage
of
it
will
you
answer
a
question
i
had
rather
ask
one
but
go
on
what
made
you
so
dry
a
desert
mr
donnegan
there
is
a
very
leading
question
again
i
do
mean
it
that
way
for
you
had
the
same
sad
hungered
look
the
first
time
i
saw
you
when
you
came
into
milligan
in
that
beggarly
disguise
i
shall
confess
one
thing
it
was
not
a
disguise
it
was
the
fact
of
me
i
am
a
beggarly
person
nonsense
i
not
witless
donnegan
you
talk
well
you
have
an
education
in
fact
i
have
an
educated
taste
i
disapprove
of
myself
you
see
and
long
ago
learned
not
to
take
myself
too
seriously
which
leads
to
the
reason
why
i
have
wandered
so
much
like
a
hunter
on
a
trail
hunting
for
what
a
chance
to
sit
in
a
saddle
or
a
chair
and
talk
as
we
are
talking
which
seems
to
be
idly
oh
you
mistake
me
under
the
surface
i
am
as
serious
as
fire
or
ice
at
the
random
hit
he
glanced
sharply
at
her
but
she
was
looking
a
little
past
him
thinking
i
have
tried
to
get
at
the
reason
behind
all
your
reasons
she
said
you
came
on
me
in
a
haphazard
fashion
and
yet
you
are
not
a
haphazard
sort
do
you
see
nothing
serious
about
me
i
see
that
you
are
unhappy
said
the
girl
gently
and
i
am
sorry
once
again
donnegan
was
jarred
and
he
came
within
an
ace
of
opening
his
mind
to
her
of
pouring
out
the
truth
about
lou
macon
love
is
a
talking
madness
in
all
men
and
he
came
within
an
ace
of
confessing
his
troubles
let
go
on
she
said
loosening
her
rein
why
not
cut
back
in
a
semicircle
toward
the
corner
toward
the
corner
no
no
there
was
a
brightening
of
his
eye
as
he
noted
her
shudder
of
distaste
or
fear
and
she
strove
to
cover
her
traces
i
sick
of
the
place
she
said
eagerly
let
get
as
far
from
it
as
we
may
but
yonder
is
a
very
good
trail
leading
past
it
of
course
we
ride
that
way
if
you
wish
but
i
rather
go
straight
ahead
if
she
had
insisted
stubbornly
he
would
have
thought
nothing
but
the
moment
she
became
politic
he
was
on
his
guard
you
dislike
something
in
the
corner
he
said
thinking
carelessly
and
aloud
you
are
afraid
of
something
back
there
but
what
could
you
be
afraid
of
then
you
may
be
afraid
of
something
for
me
ah
i
have
it
they
have
decided
to
me
for
taking
jack
landis
away
joe
rix
and
the
pedlar
are
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
he
looked
steadily
and
she
attempted
to
laugh
joe
rix
and
the
pedlar
i
would
not
stack
ten
like
them
against
you
then
it
is
someone
else
i
have
said
so
of
course
there
no
one
she
shook
her
rein
again
but
donnegan
sat
still
in
his
saddle
and
looked
fixedly
at
her
that
why
you
brought
me
out
here
he
announced
oh
nelly
lebrun
what
behind
your
mind
who
is
it
by
heaven
it
this
lord
nick
donnegan
you
letting
your
imagination
run
wild
it
gone
straight
to
the
point
but
i
not
angry
i
think
i
may
get
back
in
time
he
turned
his
horse
and
the
girl
swung
hers
beside
him
and
caught
his
arm
do
go
she
pleaded
you
right
it
nick
and
it
suicide
to
face
him
the
face
of
donnegan
set
cruelly
the
main
obstacle
he
said
come
and
watch
me
handle
it
but
she
dropped
her
head
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sitting
there
for
a
long
time
she
heard
his
careless
whistling
blow
back
to
her
as
he
galloped
toward
the
corner
if
nelly
lebrun
had
consigned
him
mentally
to
the
worms
that
thought
made
not
the
slightest
impression
upon
donnegan
a
chance
for
action
was
opening
before
him
and
above
all
a
chance
of
action
in
the
eye
of
lou
macon
and
he
welcomed
with
open
arms
the
thought
that
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
strike
for
her
and
keep
landis
with
her
he
went
arrowy
straight
and
arrowy
fast
to
the
cabin
on
the
hill
and
he
found
ample
evidence
that
it
had
become
a
center
of
attention
in
the
corner
there
was
a
scattering
of
people
in
the
distance
apparently
loitering
with
no
particular
purpose
but
undoubtedly
because
they
awaited
an
explosion
of
some
sort
he
went
by
a
group
at
which
the
chestnut
shied
and
as
donnegan
straightened
out
the
horse
again
he
caught
a
look
of
both
interest
and
pity
on
the
faces
of
the
men
did
they
give
him
up
so
soon
as
it
was
known
that
lord
nick
had
entered
the
lists
against
him
had
all
his
display
in
the
corner
gone
for
nothing
as
against
the
repute
of
this
terrible
mystery
man
his
vanity
made
him
set
his
teeth
again
dismounting
before
the
cabin
of
the
colonel
he
found
that
worthy
in
his
invalid
chair
enjoying
a
sun
bath
in
front
of
his
house
but
there
was
no
sign
of
lord
nick
no
sign
of
lou
a
grim
fear
came
to
donnegan
that
he
might
have
to
attack
nick
in
his
own
stronghold
for
jack
landis
might
already
have
been
taken
away
to
the
lebrun
house
so
he
went
straight
to
the
colonel
and
when
he
came
close
he
saw
that
the
fat
man
was
apparently
in
the
grip
of
a
chill
he
had
gathered
a
vast
blanket
about
his
shoulders
and
kept
drawing
it
tighter
beneath
his
eyes
which
looked
down
to
the
ground
there
were
violet
shadows
i
lost
said
donnegan
through
his
teeth
lord
nick
has
been
here
the
invalid
lifted
his
eyes
and
donnegan
saw
a
terrible
thing
that
the
nerve
of
the
fat
man
had
been
crushed
the
folds
of
his
face
quivered
as
he
answered
huskily
he
has
been
here
and
landis
is
gone
no
not
gone
then
nick
has
gone
to
get
a
horse
litter
he
came
up
just
to
clear
the
way
when
he
comes
back
he
find
me
the
glance
of
the
colonel
cleared
long
enough
to
survey
donnegan
slowly
from
head
to
foot
and
his
amusement
sent
the
familiar
hot
flush
over
the
face
of
the
little
man
he
straightened
to
his
full
height
which
in
his
high
heels
was
not
insignificant
but
the
colonel
was
apparently
so
desperate
that
he
was
willing
to
throw
caution
away
compared
with
lord
nick
donnegan
he
said
you
do
look
half
a
man
even
with
those
heels
and
he
smiled
calmly
at
donnegan
in
the
manner
of
one
who
having
escaped
the
lightning
bolt
itself
does
not
fear
mere
thunder
there
is
no
fool
like
a
fat
fool
said
donnegan
with
childish
viciousness
what
did
lord
nick
as
you
call
him
do
to
you
brought
out
the
yellow
my
friend
the
colonel
accepted
the
insult
without
the
quiver
of
an
eyelid
throughout
he
seemed
to
be
looking
expectantly
beyond
donnegan
my
young
friend
he
said
you
have
been
very
useful
to
me
but
i
must
confess
that
you
are
no
longer
a
tool
equal
to
the
task
i
dismiss
you
i
thank
you
cordially
for
your
efforts
they
are
worthless
you
see
that
crowd
gathering
yonder
they
have
come
to
see
lord
nick
prepare
you
for
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
make
no
mistake
if
you
are
here
when
he
returns
that
hole
will
have
to
be
dug
unless
they
throw
you
out
for
the
claws
of
the
buzzards
in
the
meantime
our
efforts
have
been
wasted
completely
i
had
enough
time
i
had
thrown
the
fear
of
sudden
death
into
landis
and
in
another
hour
he
would
have
signed
away
his
soul
to
me
for
fear
of
poison
the
colonel
paused
to
chuckle
at
some
enjoyable
memory
then
nick
came
you
see
i
know
all
about
nick
and
nick
knows
all
about
you
for
a
moment
the
agate
catlike
eyes
of
the
colonel
clouded
and
cleared
again
in
their
unfathomable
manner
at
moments
donnegan
he
said
you
have
rare
perceptions
that
is
exactly
it
nick
knows
just
about
everything
concerning
me
and
so
roll
your
pack
and
climb
on
your
horse
and
get
away
i
think
you
may
have
another
five
minutes
before
he
comes
donnegan
turned
on
his
heel
he
went
to
the
door
of
the
hut
and
threw
it
open
lou
sat
beside
landis
holding
his
hand
and
the
murmur
of
her
voice
was
still
pleasant
as
an
echo
through
the
room
when
she
looked
and
saw
donnegan
at
that
she
rose
and
her
face
hardened
as
she
looked
at
him
landis
also
lifted
his
head
and
his
face
was
convulsed
with
hatred
so
donnegan
closed
the
door
and
went
softly
away
to
his
own
shack
she
hated
him
even
as
landis
hated
him
it
seemed
he
should
have
known
that
he
would
not
be
thanked
for
bringing
back
her
lover
to
her
with
a
bullet
through
his
shoulder
sitting
in
his
cabin
he
took
his
head
between
his
hands
and
thought
of
life
and
death
and
made
up
his
mind
he
was
afraid
if
lord
nick
had
been
the
devil
himself
donnegan
could
not
have
been
more
afraid
but
if
the
big
stranger
had
been
ten
devils
instead
of
one
donnegan
would
not
have
found
it
in
his
soul
to
run
away
nothing
remained
for
him
in
the
corner
it
seemed
except
his
position
as
a
man
of
power
a
dangerous
fighter
it
was
a
less
than
worthless
position
and
yet
once
having
taken
it
up
he
could
not
abandon
it
more
than
one
gunfighter
has
been
in
the
same
place
forced
to
act
as
a
public
menace
long
after
he
has
ceased
to
feel
any
desire
to
fight
of
selfish
motives
there
remained
not
a
scruple
to
him
but
there
was
still
the
happiness
of
lou
macon
if
the
boy
were
taken
back
to
lebrun
it
would
be
fatal
to
her
for
even
if
nelly
wished
she
could
not
teach
her
eyes
new
habits
and
she
would
ceaselessly
play
on
the
heart
of
the
wounded
man
it
was
the
cessation
of
all
talk
from
the
gathering
crowd
outside
that
made
donnegan
lift
his
head
at
length
and
know
that
lord
nick
had
come
but
before
he
had
time
to
prepare
himself
the
door
was
cast
open
and
into
it
filling
it
from
side
to
side
stepped
lord
nick
there
was
no
need
of
an
introduction
donnegan
knew
him
by
the
aptness
with
which
the
name
fitted
that
glorious
figure
of
a
man
and
by
the
calm
confident
eye
which
now
was
looking
him
slowly
over
from
head
to
foot
lord
nick
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
the
colonel
told
me
he
said
in
his
deep
smooth
voice
that
you
were
waiting
for
me
here
and
donnegan
recognized
the
snakelike
malice
of
the
fat
man
in
drawing
him
into
the
fight
but
he
dismissed
that
quickly
from
his
mind
he
was
staring
fascinated
into
the
face
of
the
other
he
was
a
reader
of
men
was
donnegan
he
was
a
reader
of
mind
too
in
his
life
of
battle
he
had
learned
to
judge
the
prowess
of
others
at
a
glance
just
as
a
musician
can
tell
the
quality
of
a
violin
by
the
first
note
he
hears
played
upon
it
so
donnegan
judged
the
quality
of
fighting
men
and
looking
into
the
face
of
lord
nick
he
knew
that
he
had
met
his
equal
at
last
it
was
a
great
and
a
bitter
moment
to
him
the
sense
of
physical
smallness
he
had
banished
a
thousand
times
by
the
recollection
of
his
speed
of
hand
and
his
surety
with
weapons
he
had
looked
at
men
muscularly
great
and
despised
them
in
the
knowledge
that
a
gun
or
a
knife
would
make
him
their
master
but
in
lord
nick
he
recognized
his
own
nerveless
speed
of
hand
his
own
balance
his
own
deadly
seriousness
and
contempt
of
life
the
experience
in
battle
was
there
too
and
he
began
to
feel
that
the
size
of
the
other
crushed
him
to
the
floor
and
made
him
hopeless
it
was
unnatural
it
was
wrong
that
this
giant
in
the
body
should
be
a
giant
in
adroitness
also
already
donnegan
had
died
one
death
before
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
to
the
full
of
his
height
ready
to
die
again
and
summoning
his
nervous
force
to
meet
the
enemy
he
had
seen
that
the
big
man
had
followed
his
own
example
and
had
measured
him
at
a
glance
indeed
the
history
of
some
lives
of
action
held
less
than
the
concentrated
silence
of
these
two
men
during
that
second
space
and
now
donnegan
felt
the
cold
eye
of
the
other
eating
into
his
own
striving
to
beat
him
down
break
his
nerve
for
an
instant
panic
got
hold
on
donnegan
he
himself
had
broken
the
nerve
of
other
men
by
the
weight
of
his
unaided
eye
had
he
not
reduced
poor
jack
landis
to
a
trembling
wreck
by
five
minutes
of
silence
and
had
he
not
seen
other
brave
men
become
trembling
cowards
unable
to
face
the
light
and
all
because
of
that
terrible
power
which
lies
in
the
eye
of
some
he
fought
away
the
panic
though
perspiration
was
pouring
out
upon
his
forehead
and
beneath
his
armpits
the
colonel
is
very
kind
said
donnegan
and
that
moment
he
sent
up
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
that
his
voice
was
smooth
as
silk
and
that
he
was
able
to
smile
into
the
face
of
lord
nick
the
brow
of
the
other
clouded
and
then
smoothed
itself
deftly
perhaps
he
too
recognized
the
clang
of
steel
upon
steel
and
knew
the
metal
of
his
enemy
and
therefore
said
lord
nick
since
most
of
the
corner
expects
business
from
us
it
seems
much
as
if
one
of
us
must
kill
the
other
before
we
part
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
donnegan
i
have
been
keeping
that
in
mind
he
added
with
that
deadly
smile
of
his
that
never
reached
his
eyes
i
never
disappoint
the
public
when
it
possible
to
satisfy
them
no
and
lord
nick
nodded
you
seem
to
have
most
of
the
habits
of
an
actor
including
an
inclination
to
make
up
for
your
part
donnegan
bit
his
lip
until
it
bled
and
then
smiled
i
have
been
playing
to
fools
he
said
now
i
shall
enjoy
a
discriminating
critic
yes
remarked
lord
nick
actors
generally
desire
an
intelligent
audience
for
the
death
scene
i
applaud
your
penetration
and
i
shall
speak
well
of
you
when
this
disagreeable
duty
is
finished
come
and
lord
nick
smiled
genially
you
are
a
game
little
cock
the
telltale
flush
crimsoned
donnegan
face
and
if
the
fight
had
begun
at
that
moment
no
power
under
heaven
could
have
saved
lord
nick
from
the
frenzy
of
the
little
man
my
size
keeps
me
from
stooping
said
donnegan
i
shall
look
up
to
you
sir
until
the
moment
you
fall
well
hit
again
you
are
also
a
wit
i
see
donnegan
i
am
almost
sorry
for
the
necessity
of
this
meeting
and
if
it
were
for
the
audience
say
no
more
said
donnegan
bowing
i
read
your
heart
and
appreciate
all
you
intend
he
had
touched
his
stock
as
he
bowed
and
now
he
turned
to
the
mirror
and
carefully
adjusted
it
for
it
was
a
little
awry
from
the
ride
but
in
reality
he
used
that
moment
to
examine
his
own
face
and
the
set
of
his
jaw
and
the
clearness
of
his
eye
reassured
him
turning
again
he
surprised
a
glint
of
admiration
in
the
glance
of
lord
nick
we
are
at
one
sir
it
appears
he
said
and
there
is
no
other
way
out
of
this
disagreeable
necessity
unfortunately
not
i
have
a
certain
position
in
these
parts
people
are
apt
to
expect
a
good
deal
of
me
and
for
my
part
i
see
no
way
out
except
a
gunplay
no
way
out
between
the
devil
and
the
moon
astonishment
swept
suddenly
across
the
face
of
the
big
man
for
donnegan
turning
white
as
death
shrank
toward
the
wall
as
though
he
had
that
moment
received
cold
steel
in
his
body
say
that
again
said
donnegan
hoarsely
i
said
there
was
no
way
out
repeated
lord
nick
and
though
he
kept
his
right
hand
in
readiness
he
passed
his
left
through
his
red
hair
and
stared
at
donnegan
with
a
tinge
of
contempt
he
had
seen
men
buckle
like
this
at
the
last
moment
when
their
backs
were
to
the
wall
between
repeated
donnegan
the
devil
and
the
moon
do
you
see
a
way
yourself
he
was
astonished
again
to
see
donnegan
wince
as
if
from
a
blow
his
lips
were
trembling
and
they
writhed
stiffly
over
his
words
who
taught
you
that
expression
said
donnegan
a
gentleman
said
lord
nick
ah
my
father
sir
oh
heaven
moaned
donnegan
catching
his
hands
to
his
breast
oh
heaven
forgive
us
what
the
devil
is
in
you
asked
lord
nick
the
little
man
stood
erect
again
and
his
eyes
were
now
on
fire
you
are
henry
nicholas
reardon
he
said
lord
nick
set
his
teeth
now
he
said
it
is
certain
that
you
must
die
but
donnegan
cast
out
his
arms
and
broke
into
a
wild
laughter
oh
you
fool
you
fool
he
cried
do
you
know
me
i
am
the
cripple
the
big
man
crossed
the
floor
with
one
vast
stride
and
seizing
donnegan
by
both
shoulders
dragged
him
under
the
full
light
of
the
window
and
still
the
crazy
laughter
shook
donnegan
and
made
him
helpless
they
tied
me
to
a
board
like
a
papoose
said
donnegan
and
they
straightened
my
back
but
they
left
me
this
way
wizened
up
he
was
stammering
hysterical
and
the
words
tumbled
from
his
lips
in
a
jumble
that
was
a
month
after
you
ran
away
from
home
i
was
going
to
find
you
got
bigger
took
the
road
kept
hunting
then
i
met
a
yegg
who
told
about
rusty
dick
described
him
like
you
i
thought
i
thought
you
were
dead
and
the
tears
rolled
down
his
face
he
sobbed
like
a
woman
a
strange
thing
happened
then
lord
nick
lifted
the
little
man
in
his
arms
as
if
he
were
a
child
and
literally
carried
him
in
that
fashion
to
the
bunk
he
put
him
down
tenderly
still
with
one
mighty
arm
around
his
back
you
are
garry
you
garrison
donnegan
reardon
aye
that
what
i
am
henry
do
say
that
you
do
know
me
but
your
back
i
thought
i
know
hopeless
they
said
i
was
but
they
brought
in
a
young
doctor
now
look
at
me
little
i
never
grew
big
but
hard
henry
as
leather
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
knowing
that
donnegan
had
begun
life
as
a
cripple
it
was
easy
to
appreciate
certain
things
about
his
expression
a
cold
wistfulness
and
his
manner
of
reading
the
minds
of
men
lord
nick
was
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
dragged
donnegan
back
to
the
bunk
and
forced
him
to
sit
down
with
the
weight
of
his
arms
and
he
could
not
keep
his
hands
from
his
younger
brother
as
though
he
were
blind
and
had
to
use
the
sense
of
touch
to
reassure
him
i
heard
lies
they
said
everybody
was
dead
i
thought
the
fever
killed
them
all
except
me
uncle
toby
took
me
in
he
was
a
devil
helped
me
along
but
i
left
him
when
i
could
and
do
tell
me
any
more
all
that
matters
is
that
i
have
you
at
last
garry
heaven
knows
it
a
horrible
thing
to
be
kithless
and
kinless
but
i
have
you
now
ah
lad
but
the
old
pain
has
left
its
mark
on
you
poor
garry
donnegan
shuddered
i
forgotten
it
do
bring
it
back
i
keep
feeling
that
you
should
be
in
that
chair
i
know
but
i
not
i
hard
as
nails
i
tell
you
he
leaped
to
his
feet
again
and
not
so
small
as
you
might
think
henry
oh
big
enough
garry
big
enough
to
paralyze
the
corner
from
what
i
heard
i
been
playing
a
game
with
henry
and
now
if
one
of
us
could
clear
the
road
what
will
we
do
together
eh
the
smile
of
lord
nick
showed
his
teeth
have
i
been
hungry
all
my
life
for
a
man
like
you
lad
somebody
to
stand
and
guard
my
back
while
i
faced
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
do
my
share
of
the
facing
too
you
will
garry
but
i
your
elder
man
man
nobody
my
elder
except
one
that
spent
half
his
life
as
i
have
done
we
teach
you
to
forget
the
pain
i
make
life
roses
for
you
garry
and
the
fools
outside
thought
donnegan
broke
into
a
soundless
laughter
and
running
to
the
door
opened
it
a
fraction
of
an
inch
and
peeped
out
they
standing
about
in
a
circle
i
can
see
gaping
even
from
here
what
will
they
think
henry
lord
nick
ground
his
teeth
they
think
i
backed
down
from
you
he
said
gloomily
think
i
taken
water
for
the
first
time
why
confound
the
first
man
that
opens
his
head
i
know
i
know
you
fill
his
mouth
with
lead
and
so
would
i
but
if
it
ever
gets
about
as
it
sure
to
that
lord
nick
as
they
call
me
has
been
bluffed
down
without
a
fight
i
have
every
chinaman
that
cooks
on
the
range
talking
back
to
me
i
have
to
start
all
over
again
do
say
that
henry
do
you
see
that
i
go
out
and
explain
that
i
your
brother
what
good
will
that
do
no
do
we
look
alike
donnegan
stopped
short
i
not
very
big
he
said
rather
coldly
but
then
i
not
so
very
small
either
i
found
myself
big
enough
speaking
in
general
besides
we
have
the
same
hair
and
eyes
why
man
people
will
laugh
when
they
hear
that
we
call
ourselves
brothers
donnegan
ground
his
teeth
and
the
old
flush
burned
upon
his
face
i
cut
some
throats
if
they
do
he
said
trembling
with
his
passion
i
can
hear
them
say
it
nick
walked
in
on
donnegan
prepared
to
eat
him
up
he
measured
him
up
and
down
saw
that
he
was
a
fighting
wildcat
in
spite
of
his
size
and
decided
to
back
out
and
donnegan
was
willing
they
could
come
out
without
a
story
of
some
kind
with
the
whole
world
expecting
a
death
in
that
cabin
so
they
framed
a
crazy
story
about
being
brothers
i
can
hear
them
say
that
donnegan
and
it
makes
me
wild
do
you
call
me
donnegan
said
donnegan
sadly
no
no
garry
do
be
so
touchy
you
never
got
over
that
i
see
still
all
pride
and
fire
you
not
very
humble
yourself
henry
maybe
not
maybe
not
but
i
been
in
a
certain
position
around
these
parts
don
garry
and
it
hard
to
see
it
go
donnegan
closed
his
eyes
in
deep
reverie
and
then
he
forced
out
the
words
one
by
one
henry
i
let
everybody
know
that
it
was
i
who
backed
down
that
we
were
about
to
fight
he
was
unable
to
speak
he
tore
the
stock
loose
at
his
throat
and
went
on
we
were
about
to
fight
i
lost
my
nerve
you
could
shoot
a
helpless
man
we
began
to
talk
we
found
out
we
are
brothers
damnation
broke
out
lord
nick
and
he
struck
himself
violently
across
the
forehead
with
the
back
of
his
hand
i
a
skunk
garry
lad
why
for
a
minute
i
was
about
to
let
you
do
it
no
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
was
arguing
himself
away
from
the
temptation
what
do
i
care
what
they
say
we
cram
the
words
back
down
their
throats
and
be
hanged
to
here
i
am
worrying
about
myself
like
a
selfish
dog
without
letting
myself
be
happy
over
finding
you
but
i
am
happy
garry
heaven
knows
it
and
you
do
doubt
it
do
you
old
fellow
ah
said
donnegan
and
he
smiled
to
cover
a
touch
of
sadness
i
hope
not
no
i
do
doubt
you
of
course
i
spent
my
life
wishing
for
you
since
you
left
us
you
see
and
then
i
followed
you
for
three
years
on
the
road
hunting
everywhere
you
did
that
yes
three
years
i
liked
the
careless
life
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
not
worth
much
henry
i
a
loafer
by
instinct
and
not
another
word
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
lord
nick
and
he
frowned
them
away
confound
it
garry
you
unman
me
i
be
weeping
like
a
woman
in
a
minute
but
now
sit
down
we
still
have
some
things
to
talk
over
and
we
get
to
a
quick
conclusion
ah
yes
said
donnegan
and
at
the
emotion
which
had
come
in
the
face
of
lord
nick
his
own
expression
softened
wonderfully
a
light
seemed
to
stand
in
his
face
we
brush
over
the
incidentals
and
everything
is
incidental
aside
from
the
fact
that
we
together
again
they
can
chisel
iron
chain
apart
but
we
never
be
separated
again
god
willing
he
looked
up
as
he
spoke
and
his
face
was
for
the
moment
as
pure
as
the
face
of
a
child
donnegan
the
thief
the
beggar
the
liar
by
gift
and
the
by
trade
and
artistry
but
lord
nick
in
the
meantime
was
looking
down
to
the
floor
and
mustering
his
thoughts
the
main
thing
is
entirely
simple
he
said
you
make
one
concession
to
my
pride
garry
boy
can
you
ask
me
said
donnegan
softly
and
he
cast
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
that
offered
his
heart
and
his
soul
can
you
ask
me
anything
i
have
is
yours
do
say
that
answered
lord
nick
tenderly
but
this
small
thing
my
pride
you
know
i
despise
myself
for
caring
what
people
think
but
weak
i
admit
it
but
i
ca
help
it
talk
out
man
you
see
if
there
a
bottom
to
things
that
i
can
give
well
it
this
everyone
knows
that
i
came
up
here
to
get
young
jack
landis
and
bring
him
back
to
lebrun
from
which
you
stole
him
you
clever
young
devil
well
i
simply
take
him
back
there
garry
and
then
i
never
have
to
ask
another
favor
of
you
he
was
astonished
by
a
sudden
silence
and
looking
up
again
he
saw
that
donnegan
sat
with
his
hand
at
his
breast
it
was
a
singularly
feminine
gesture
to
which
he
resorted
it
was
a
habit
which
had
come
to
him
in
his
youth
in
the
invalid
chair
when
the
ceaseless
torment
of
his
crippled
back
became
too
great
for
him
to
bear
and
clearly
indeed
those
days
were
brought
home
to
lord
nick
as
he
glanced
up
for
donnegan
was
staring
at
him
in
the
same
old
familiar
agony
mute
and
helpless
at
this
lord
nick
very
frankly
frowned
in
turn
and
when
he
frowned
his
face
grew
marvelously
dark
like
some
wrathful
god
for
there
was
a
noble
a
grecian
purity
to
the
profile
of
henry
nicholas
reardon
and
when
he
frowned
he
seemed
to
be
scorning
from
a
distance
ignoble
earthly
things
which
troubled
him
i
know
it
is
exactly
easy
for
you
garry
he
admitted
you
have
your
own
pride
you
have
your
own
position
here
in
the
corner
but
i
want
you
to
notice
that
mine
is
different
you
spent
a
day
for
what
you
have
in
the
corner
here
i
spent
ten
years
you
played
a
prank
acted
a
part
and
cast
a
jest
for
what
you
have
but
for
the
place
which
i
hold
brother
mine
i
schemed
with
my
wits
played
fast
and
loose
and
killed
men
do
you
hear
i
bought
it
with
blood
and
things
you
buy
at
such
a
price
ought
to
stick
eh
he
banished
his
frown
the
smile
played
suddenly
across
his
features
why
i
arguing
with
myself
but
that
look
you
gave
me
a
minute
ago
had
me
worried
for
a
little
while
at
this
donnegan
who
had
allowed
his
head
to
fall
so
that
he
seemed
to
be
nodding
in
acquiescence
now
raised
his
face
and
lord
nick
perceived
the
same
white
pain
upon
it
the
same
look
which
had
been
on
the
face
of
the
cripple
so
often
in
the
other
days
henry
said
the
younger
brother
i
give
you
my
oath
that
my
pride
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
let
you
drive
me
barefoot
before
you
through
the
street
yonder
i
let
every
soul
in
the
corner
know
that
i
have
no
pride
where
you
concerned
i
do
whatever
you
wish
with
one
exception
and
that
one
is
the
unlucky
thing
you
ask
pardner
you
must
ask
for
jack
landis
anything
else
i
work
like
a
slave
to
get
for
you
i
fight
your
battles
i
serve
you
in
any
way
you
name
but
do
take
landis
back
he
had
talked
eagerly
the
words
coming
with
a
rush
and
he
found
at
the
end
that
lord
nick
was
looking
at
him
in
bewilderment
when
a
man
is
condemned
to
death
said
lord
nick
slowly
suppose
somebody
offers
him
anything
in
the
world
that
he
wants
palaces
riches
power
everything
except
his
life
what
would
the
condemned
man
say
to
a
friend
who
made
such
an
offer
he
laugh
at
him
and
then
call
him
a
traitor
eh
but
i
do
laugh
at
you
garry
i
simply
explain
to
you
why
i
have
to
have
landis
back
listen
he
counted
off
his
points
upon
the
tips
of
his
fingers
in
the
confident
manner
of
a
teacher
who
deals
with
a
stupid
child
waiting
patiently
for
the
young
mind
to
comprehend
we
been
bleeding
jack
landis
do
you
know
why
because
it
was
lester
who
made
the
strike
up
here
he
started
out
to
file
his
claim
he
stopped
at
the
house
of
colonel
macon
that
old
devil
learned
the
location
learned
everything
detained
lester
with
a
trick
and
rushed
young
landis
away
to
file
the
claims
for
himself
then
when
lester
came
up
here
he
found
that
his
claims
had
been
jumped
and
when
he
went
to
the
law
there
was
no
law
that
could
help
him
he
had
nothing
but
his
naked
word
for
what
he
had
discovered
and
naturally
the
word
of
a
ruffian
like
lester
had
no
weight
against
the
word
of
landis
and
you
see
landis
thought
that
he
was
entirely
in
the
right
lester
tried
the
other
way
tried
to
jump
the
claims
and
was
shot
down
by
landis
so
lester
sent
for
me
what
was
i
to
do
kill
landis
the
mine
would
go
to
his
heirs
i
tried
a
different
way
bleeding
him
of
his
profits
after
i
explained
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
he
half
admitted
that
but
he
naturally
would
give
up
the
mines
even
after
we
almost
proved
to
him
that
lester
had
the
first
right
so
landis
has
been
mining
the
gold
and
we
been
drawing
it
away
from
him
it
looks
tricky
but
really
it
only
just
and
lester
and
lebrun
split
with
me
but
i
tell
you
garry
that
i
give
up
everything
without
an
afterthought
i
give
up
the
money
and
i
make
lebrun
and
lester
shut
up
without
a
word
i
make
them
play
square
and
not
try
to
knife
landis
in
the
back
i
do
all
that
willingly
for
you
but
garry
i
ca
give
up
taking
landis
back
to
lebrun
and
keeping
him
there
until
he
well
why
man
i
saw
him
in
the
hut
just
now
he
wants
to
go
afraid
of
the
old
colonel
as
if
he
were
poison
and
i
think
he
wise
in
being
afraid
the
colonel
wo
touch
him
said
donnegan
no
no
i
told
him
what
would
happen
if
he
does
tush
garry
colonel
macon
is
the
murderer
i
ever
known
but
come
out
in
the
open
lad
you
see
that
i
ready
to
listen
to
reason
except
on
one
point
tell
me
why
you
so
set
on
this
keeping
of
landis
here
against
my
will
and
even
against
the
lad
own
will
i
reasonable
garry
do
you
doubt
that
explaining
his
own
mildness
the
voice
of
lord
nick
swelled
again
and
filled
the
room
and
he
frowned
on
his
brother
but
donnegan
looked
on
him
sadly
there
is
a
girl
he
began
why
did
i
guess
it
exclaimed
lord
nick
if
ever
you
find
a
man
unreasonable
stubborn
and
foolish
you
always
find
a
woman
behind
it
all
this
trouble
because
of
a
piece
of
calico
he
leaned
back
laughing
thunderously
in
his
relief
come
come
i
was
prepared
for
a
tragedy
now
tell
me
about
this
girl
who
and
what
is
she
the
daughter
of
the
colonel
you
in
love
with
her
i
glad
to
hear
it
garry
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
been
afraid
that
you
were
hunting
in
my
own
preserve
but
if
it
the
colonel
daughter
you
welcome
to
her
so
you
love
the
girl
she
pretty
lad
i
love
her
said
donnegan
in
an
indescribably
tender
voice
i
love
her
who
am
i
to
love
her
a
thief
a
a
miserable
play
actor
a
gambler
a
drunkard
i
love
her
bah
if
there
was
one
quality
of
the
mind
with
which
lord
nick
was
less
familiar
than
with
all
others
it
was
humbleness
of
spirit
he
now
abased
his
magnificent
head
and
resting
his
chin
in
the
mighty
palm
of
his
hand
he
stared
with
astonishment
and
commiseration
into
the
face
of
donnegan
he
seemed
to
be
learning
new
things
every
moment
about
his
brother
leave
me
out
of
the
question
said
donnegan
ca
be
done
if
i
leave
you
out
dear
boy
there
not
one
of
them
that
i
care
a
hang
about
i
ride
roughshod
over
the
whole
lot
done
it
before
to
better
men
than
these
then
you
change
i
know
this
is
the
fact
of
the
matter
she
loves
landis
and
if
you
take
landis
away
where
will
you
put
him
where
he
was
stolen
away
in
lebrun
and
what
will
be
in
lebrun
joe
rix
to
guard
him
and
the
old
negress
to
nurse
him
no
no
nelly
lebrun
will
be
there
eh
are
you
glancing
at
her
now
henry
you
yourself
know
that
landis
is
mad
about
that
girl
oh
she
flirted
a
bit
with
him
turned
the
fool
head
he
come
out
of
it
safe
she
wo
break
his
heart
i
seen
her
work
on
others
he
chuckled
at
the
memory
what
do
i
care
about
landis
said
donnegan
with
unutterable
scorn
it
the
girl
you
break
her
heart
henry
and
if
you
do
i
never
forgive
you
steady
lad
this
is
a
good
deal
like
a
threat
no
no
no
not
a
threat
heaven
knows
by
heaven
exclaimed
lord
nick
i
begin
to
be
irritated
to
see
you
stick
on
a
silly
point
like
this
listen
to
me
lad
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
making
all
this
trouble
about
a
slip
of
a
girl
the
heart
of
a
girl
said
donnegan
calmly
let
landis
go
then
take
her
in
your
arms
and
kiss
her
worries
away
i
warrant
you
can
do
it
i
gather
from
nell
that
you
not
around
women
i
echoed
donnegan
turning
pale
do
jest
at
this
henry
i
as
serious
as
death
she
the
type
of
woman
made
to
love
one
man
and
one
man
only
landis
may
be
common
as
dirt
but
she
does
see
it
fastened
her
heart
on
him
i
looked
in
on
her
a
little
while
ago
she
turned
white
when
she
saw
me
i
brought
landis
to
her
but
she
hates
me
because
i
had
to
shoot
him
down
garry
said
the
big
man
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
you
in
love
it
shook
donnegan
to
the
core
but
he
replied
instantly
if
i
were
in
love
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
have
shot
to
kill
when
i
met
landis
at
this
his
brother
blinked
frowned
and
shook
his
head
the
point
was
apparently
plain
to
him
and
wiped
out
his
previous
convictions
also
it
eased
his
mind
then
you
do
love
the
girl
i
either
way
my
hands
are
cleared
of
the
worry
if
you
want
her
let
me
take
landis
if
you
do
want
her
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
except
silly
sentiment
donnegan
made
no
answer
if
she
comes
to
lebrun
house
i
see
that
nell
does
bother
him
too
much
can
you
control
her
if
she
wants
to
see
this
fool
can
you
keep
her
away
and
if
she
goes
to
him
can
you
control
her
smiling
certainly
said
lord
nick
but
he
flushed
heavily
donnegan
smiled
she
a
devil
of
a
girl
admitted
henry
reardon
but
this
is
beside
the
point
which
is
that
you
sticking
on
a
matter
that
means
everything
to
me
and
which
is
only
a
secondhand
interest
to
you
a
point
of
sentiment
you
pity
the
girl
what
pity
bah
i
pity
a
dog
in
the
street
but
would
i
cross
you
garry
lad
to
save
the
dog
sentiment
i
say
silly
sentiment
donnegan
rose
it
was
a
silly
sentiment
he
said
hoarsely
that
put
me
on
the
road
following
you
henry
it
was
a
silly
sentiment
that
turned
me
into
a
wastrel
a
wanderer
a
man
without
a
home
and
without
friends
it
wrong
to
throw
that
in
my
face
muttered
lord
nick
it
is
and
i
sorry
for
it
but
i
want
you
to
see
that
matters
of
sentiment
may
be
matters
of
life
and
death
with
me
aye
if
it
were
for
you
it
would
be
different
i
might
see
my
way
clear
but
for
a
girl
you
have
only
a
distant
interest
in
it
is
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
her
heart
shall
be
broken
come
come
let
talk
man
talk
besides
girls
hearts
do
break
in
this
country
you
i
tell
you
the
question
of
her
happiness
is
worth
more
than
a
dozen
lives
like
yours
and
mine
there
had
been
a
gathering
impatience
in
lord
nick
now
he
also
leaped
to
his
feet
a
giant
tell
me
in
one
word
you
stick
on
this
point
in
one
word
yes
then
you
deny
me
garry
you
set
me
aside
for
a
silly
purpose
of
your
own
a
matter
that
really
does
mean
much
to
you
it
shows
me
where
i
stand
in
your
eyes
and
nothing
between
the
devil
and
the
moon
shall
make
me
sidestep
they
remained
silent
staring
at
each
other
lord
nick
stood
with
a
flush
of
anger
growing
donnegan
became
whiter
than
ever
and
he
stiffened
himself
to
his
full
height
which
in
all
who
knew
him
well
was
the
danger
signal
you
take
landis
he
said
softly
i
do
not
said
donnegan
while
i
live
you
mean
cried
lord
nick
i
mean
it
they
had
been
swept
back
to
the
point
at
which
that
strangest
of
scenes
began
but
this
time
there
was
an
added
element
horror
you
fight
to
the
death
henry
garry
if
one
of
us
should
kill
the
other
he
be
cursed
forever
i
know
it
and
she
worth
even
this
a
thousand
times
more
what
are
we
dust
in
the
wind
dust
in
the
wind
but
a
woman
like
that
is
divine
henry
lord
nick
swayed
a
little
setting
himself
in
balance
like
an
animal
preparing
for
the
leap
if
it
comes
to
the
pinch
it
is
you
who
will
die
he
said
you
no
chance
against
me
garry
and
i
swear
to
you
that
i
weaken
you
prove
that
you
do
care
for
me
you
put
another
above
me
it
my
pride
my
life
that
you
sacrifice
to
the
whim
of
a
girl
his
passion
choked
him
are
you
ready
said
donnegan
yes
move
first
i
have
never
formed
the
habit
nor
i
you
fool
take
what
little
advantage
you
can
because
it
help
you
in
the
end
you
shall
see
i
have
a
second
sight
henry
and
it
shows
me
you
dead
on
the
floor
there
looking
bigger
than
ever
and
i
see
the
gun
smoking
in
my
hand
and
my
heart
as
dead
as
ashes
oh
henry
if
there
were
only
some
other
way
they
were
both
pale
now
aye
murmured
lord
nick
if
we
could
find
a
judge
my
hand
turns
to
lead
when
i
think
of
fighting
you
garry
perspiration
stood
on
the
face
of
donnegan
name
a
judge
i
abide
by
the
decision
some
man
no
no
what
man
could
understand
me
a
woman
henry
nell
lebrun
the
girl
who
loves
you
you
want
me
to
plead
before
her
put
her
on
her
honor
and
she
be
as
straight
as
a
string
with
both
of
us
for
a
moment
donnegan
considered
and
at
length
she
loves
you
henry
you
have
that
advantage
you
have
only
to
let
her
know
that
this
is
a
vital
matter
to
you
and
she
speak
as
you
wish
her
to
speak
nonsense
you
do
know
her
you
seen
yourself
that
no
man
can
control
her
absolutely
make
a
concession
a
thousand
garry
dear
boy
if
they
get
us
clear
from
this
horrible
mess
only
this
leave
the
corner
for
a
few
hours
give
me
until
tonight
let
me
see
nelly
during
that
time
you
had
years
to
work
on
her
i
want
only
this
time
to
put
my
own
case
before
her
thank
heaven
that
we
coming
to
see
light
and
a
way
out
aye
henry
the
big
man
wiped
his
forehead
and
sighed
in
his
relief
a
minute
ago
i
was
ready
but
we
forget
all
this
what
will
you
do
how
will
you
persuade
nelly
i
almost
think
that
you
intend
to
make
love
to
her
garry
the
little
man
turned
paler
still
it
is
exactly
what
i
intend
he
said
quietly
the
brow
of
lord
nick
darkened
solemnly
and
then
he
forced
a
laugh
she
be
afraid
to
turn
me
down
garry
but
try
your
own
way
he
bit
his
lips
why
if
you
influence
her
that
way
do
it
what
a
fickle
jade
to
me
nothing
however
i
do
it
you
stick
by
her
judgment
henry
the
perspiration
had
started
on
lord
nick
forehead
again
doubt
swayed
him
but
pride
forced
him
on
i
come
again
tonight
he
said
gloomily
i
meet
you
in
milligan
in
milligan
then
lord
nick
without
a
word
of
farewell
stamped
across
the
hut
and
out
as
for
donnegan
he
stepped
backward
his
legs
buckled
beneath
him
and
when
big
george
entered
with
a
scared
face
he
found
the
little
man
half
sitting
on
the
bunk
half
lying
against
the
wall
with
the
face
and
the
staring
eyes
of
a
dead
man
it
was
a
long
time
before
donnegan
left
the
hut
and
when
he
came
out
the
crowd
which
had
gathered
to
watch
the
fight
or
at
least
to
mark
the
reports
of
the
guns
when
those
two
terrible
warriors
met
was
scattered
there
remained
before
donnegan
only
the
colonel
in
his
invalid
chair
even
from
the
distance
one
could
see
that
his
expression
was
changed
and
when
the
little
man
came
near
the
colonel
looked
up
to
him
with
something
akin
to
humility
donnegan
he
said
stopping
the
other
as
donnegan
headed
for
the
door
of
the
hut
donnegan
do
go
in
there
just
now
donnegan
turned
and
came
slowly
toward
him
the
reason
said
the
colonel
is
that
you
probably
wo
receive
a
very
cheery
reception
unfortunate
very
unfortunate
lou
has
turned
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
and
she
wo
listen
to
reason
he
chuckled
softly
i
never
dreamed
there
was
so
much
of
my
metal
in
her
blood
will
tell
my
boy
blood
will
tell
and
when
you
finally
get
her
you
find
that
she
worth
waiting
for
let
me
tell
you
a
secret
said
donnegan
dryly
i
am
no
longer
waiting
for
her
ah
smiled
the
colonel
of
course
not
this
bringing
of
landis
to
her
it
was
all
pure
it
was
not
an
attempt
to
soften
her
heart
it
was
not
a
cunning
maneuver
tush
of
course
not
i
am
about
to
make
a
profound
remark
said
donnegan
carelessly
by
all
means
you
read
the
minds
of
other
people
through
a
colored
glass
colonel
you
see
yourself
everywhere
in
other
words
i
put
my
own
motives
into
the
actions
and
behind
the
actions
of
people
perhaps
i
am
full
of
weaknesses
very
full
in
the
meantime
let
me
tell
you
one
important
thing
if
you
have
not
made
the
heart
of
lou
tender
toward
you
you
have
at
least
frightened
her
the
jaw
on
donnegan
set
excellent
he
said
huskily
perhaps
better
than
you
think
and
to
keep
you
abreast
with
the
times
you
must
know
another
thing
lou
has
a
silly
idea
that
you
are
a
lost
soul
donnegan
but
she
attributes
your
fall
entirely
to
my
weakness
nothing
can
convince
her
that
you
did
not
intend
to
kill
landis
nothing
can
convince
her
that
you
did
not
act
on
my
inspiration
i
have
tried
arguing
bah
she
overwhelmed
me
with
her
scorn
you
are
a
villain
says
lou
and
i
have
made
you
one
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
memory
of
her
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
tears
upon
my
honor
and
when
a
girl
begins
to
weep
about
a
man
i
do
need
to
say
he
is
close
to
her
heart
you
are
full
of
maxims
colonel
macon
as
a
nut
is
full
of
meat
old
experience
you
know
in
the
meantime
lou
is
perfectly
certain
that
i
intend
to
make
away
with
landis
ha
ha
ha
the
laughter
of
the
colonel
was
a
cheery
thunder
and
soft
as
with
distance
landis
is
equally
convinced
he
begs
lou
not
to
fall
asleep
lest
i
should
steal
in
on
him
she
hardly
dares
leave
him
to
cook
his
food
i
actually
think
she
would
have
been
glad
to
see
that
fiend
lord
nick
take
landis
away
donnegan
smiled
wanly
but
could
he
tell
her
poor
girl
the
story
of
nelly
lebrun
landis
in
fear
of
his
life
was
no
doubt
at
this
moment
pouring
out
protestations
of
deathless
affection
and
they
both
consider
you
an
archdemon
for
keeping
lord
nick
away
again
donnegan
winced
and
coughed
behind
his
hand
to
cover
it
however
went
on
the
colonel
when
it
comes
to
matters
with
the
hearts
of
women
i
trust
to
time
time
alone
will
show
her
that
landis
is
a
puppy
in
the
meantime
colonel
she
keeps
you
from
coming
near
landis
not
at
all
you
fail
to
understand
me
and
my
methods
dear
boy
i
have
only
to
roll
my
chair
into
the
room
and
sit
and
smile
at
jack
in
order
to
send
him
into
an
hysteria
of
terror
it
is
amusing
to
watch
and
i
can
be
there
while
lou
is
in
the
room
and
through
a
few
careful
innuendoes
convey
to
landis
my
undying
determination
to
either
remove
him
from
my
path
and
automatically
become
his
heir
or
else
secure
from
him
a
legal
transfer
of
his
rights
to
the
mines
i
have
learned
said
donnegan
that
landis
has
not
the
slightest
claim
to
them
himself
and
that
you
set
him
on
the
trail
of
the
claims
by
trickery
the
colonel
did
not
wince
of
course
not
said
the
fat
trickster
not
the
slightest
right
my
claim
is
a
claim
of
superior
wits
you
see
and
in
the
end
all
your
labor
shall
be
rewarded
for
my
share
will
go
to
lou
and
through
her
it
shall
come
to
you
no
quite
logical
the
colonel
disregarded
the
other
smile
but
i
have
a
painful
confession
to
make
well
i
misjudged
you
donnegan
a
moment
since
when
i
was
nearly
distraught
with
disappointment
i
said
some
most
unpleasant
things
to
you
i
have
forgotten
them
but
the
colonel
raised
his
strong
forefinger
and
shook
his
head
smiling
no
no
donnegan
if
you
deny
it
i
shall
know
that
you
are
harboring
the
most
undying
grudge
against
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
just
had
an
interview
with
lord
nick
and
the
cursed
fellow
put
my
nerves
on
edge
the
colonel
made
a
wry
face
and
when
you
came
i
saw
no
manner
in
which
you
could
possibly
thwart
him
his
eyes
grew
wistful
between
friends
as
a
son
to
his
future
father
he
said
softly
you
tell
me
what
the
charm
was
that
you
used
on
nick
to
send
him
away
i
watched
him
come
out
of
the
shack
he
was
in
a
fury
i
could
see
that
by
the
way
his
head
thrust
out
between
his
big
shoulders
and
when
he
went
down
the
hill
he
was
striding
like
a
giant
but
every
now
and
then
he
would
stop
short
and
his
head
would
go
up
as
if
he
were
tempted
to
turn
around
and
go
back
but
did
quite
have
the
nerve
donnegan
tell
me
the
trick
of
it
willingly
i
appealed
to
his
gambling
instinct
which
leaves
me
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
but
donnegan
smiled
in
his
own
peculiar
and
mirthless
manner
and
he
went
on
to
the
hut
not
that
he
expected
a
cheery
greeting
from
lou
macon
but
he
was
drawn
by
the
same
perverse
instinct
which
tempts
a
man
to
throw
himself
from
a
great
height
at
the
door
he
paused
a
moment
he
could
distinguish
no
words
but
he
caught
the
murmur
of
lou
voice
as
she
talked
to
jack
landis
and
it
had
that
infinitely
gentle
quality
which
only
a
woman
voice
can
have
and
only
when
she
nurses
the
sick
it
was
a
pleasant
torture
to
donnegan
to
hear
it
at
length
he
summoned
his
resolution
and
tapped
at
the
door
the
voice
of
lou
macon
stopped
he
heard
a
hurried
and
whispered
consultation
what
did
they
expect
then
swift
on
the
floor
and
she
opened
the
door
there
was
a
smile
of
expectancy
on
her
lips
her
eyes
were
bright
but
when
she
saw
donnegan
her
lips
pinched
in
she
stared
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
ghost
i
knew
i
knew
she
said
piteously
falling
back
a
step
but
still
keeping
her
hand
upon
the
knob
of
the
door
as
if
to
block
the
way
to
donnegan
oh
jack
he
has
killed
lord
nick
and
now
he
is
here
to
do
what
to
kill
landis
in
turn
her
horrified
eyes
implied
as
much
he
saw
landis
in
the
distance
raise
himself
upon
one
elbow
and
his
face
was
gray
not
with
pain
but
with
dread
it
ca
be
groaned
landis
lord
nick
is
alive
said
donnegan
and
i
have
not
come
here
to
torment
you
i
have
only
come
to
ask
that
you
let
me
speak
with
you
alone
for
a
moment
lou
he
watched
her
face
intently
all
the
cabin
was
in
deep
shadow
but
the
golden
hair
of
the
girl
glowed
as
if
with
an
inherent
light
of
its
own
and
the
same
light
touched
her
face
jack
landis
was
stricken
with
panic
he
stammered
in
a
dreadful
eagerness
of
fear
do
leave
me
lou
you
know
what
it
means
he
wants
to
get
you
out
of
the
way
so
that
the
colonel
can
be
alone
with
me
do
go
lou
go
as
though
she
saw
how
hopeless
it
was
to
try
to
bar
donnegan
by
closing
the
door
against
him
she
fell
back
to
the
bed
she
kept
her
eye
on
the
little
man
as
if
to
watch
against
a
surprise
attack
and
fumbling
behind
her
her
hand
found
the
hand
of
landis
and
closed
over
it
with
the
reassurance
of
a
mother
do
be
afraid
jack
i
wo
leave
you
not
unless
they
carry
me
away
by
force
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
said
donnegan
in
torment
that
the
colonel
shall
not
come
near
landis
while
you
away
with
me
your
word
murmured
the
girl
with
a
sort
of
horrified
wonder
your
word
and
donnegan
bowed
his
head
but
all
at
once
she
cast
out
her
free
hand
toward
him
while
the
other
still
cherished
the
weakness
of
jack
landis
oh
give
them
up
she
cried
give
up
my
father
and
all
his
wicked
plans
there
is
something
good
in
you
give
him
up
come
with
us
stand
for
us
and
we
shall
be
grateful
all
our
lives
the
little
man
had
removed
his
hat
so
that
the
sunshine
burned
brightly
on
his
red
hair
indeed
there
was
always
a
flamelike
quality
about
him
in
inaction
he
seemed
femininely
frail
and
pale
but
when
his
spirit
was
roused
his
eyes
blazed
as
his
hair
burned
in
the
sunlight
you
shall
learn
in
the
end
he
said
to
the
girl
that
everything
i
do
i
do
for
you
she
cried
out
as
if
he
had
struck
her
it
not
worthy
of
you
she
said
bitterly
you
are
keeping
jack
here
in
peril
for
my
sake
for
your
sake
said
donnegan
she
looked
at
him
with
a
queer
pain
in
her
eyes
to
keep
you
from
needless
lying
she
said
let
me
tell
you
that
jack
has
told
me
everything
i
am
not
angry
because
you
come
and
pretend
that
you
do
all
these
horrible
things
for
my
sake
i
know
my
father
has
tempted
you
with
a
promise
of
a
great
deal
of
money
but
in
the
end
you
will
get
nothing
no
he
will
twist
everything
away
from
you
and
leave
you
nothing
but
as
for
me
i
know
everything
jack
told
me
he
has
told
you
what
what
about
the
woman
you
love
the
woman
i
love
echoed
donnegan
stupefied
it
seemed
that
lou
macon
could
only
name
her
with
an
effort
that
left
her
trembling
the
lebrun
woman
she
said
jack
has
told
me
did
you
tell
her
that
he
asked
landis
the
whole
town
knows
it
stammered
the
wounded
man
the
cunning
hypocrisy
spurred
donnegan
he
put
his
foot
on
the
threshold
of
the
shack
and
at
this
the
girl
cried
out
and
shrank
from
him
but
landis
was
too
paralyzed
to
stir
or
speak
for
a
moment
donnegan
was
wildly
tempted
to
pour
his
torrent
of
contempt
and
accusation
upon
landis
to
what
end
to
prove
to
the
girl
that
the
big
fellow
had
coolly
tricked
her
that
it
was
to
be
near
nelly
lebrun
as
much
as
to
be
away
from
the
colonel
that
he
wished
so
ardently
to
leave
the
shack
after
all
lou
macon
was
made
happy
by
an
illusion
let
her
keep
it
he
looked
at
her
sadly
again
she
stood
defiant
over
landis
ready
to
protect
the
helpless
bulk
of
the
man
so
donnegan
closed
the
door
softly
and
turned
away
with
ashes
in
his
heart
when
nelly
lebrun
raised
her
head
from
her
hands
donnegan
was
a
far
figure
yet
even
in
the
distance
she
could
catch
the
lilt
and
easy
sway
of
his
body
he
rode
as
he
walked
lightly
his
feet
in
the
stirrups
half
taking
his
weight
in
a
fashion
for
a
moment
she
was
on
the
verge
of
spurring
after
him
but
she
kept
the
rein
taut
and
merely
stared
until
he
dipped
away
among
the
hills
for
one
thing
she
was
quite
assured
that
she
could
not
overtake
that
hard
rider
and
again
she
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
interfere
to
step
between
lord
nick
and
one
of
his
purposes
would
have
been
like
stepping
before
an
avalanche
and
commanding
it
to
halt
with
a
raised
hand
she
watched
miserably
until
even
the
dust
cloud
dissolved
and
the
bare
brown
hills
alone
remained
before
her
then
she
turned
away
and
hour
after
hour
let
her
black
jog
on
to
nelly
lebrun
this
day
was
one
of
those
still
times
which
come
over
the
life
of
a
person
and
in
which
they
see
themselves
in
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
world
clearly
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
nelly
loved
donnegan
certainly
not
as
yet
for
the
familiar
figure
of
lord
nick
filled
her
imagination
but
the
little
man
was
different
lord
nick
commanded
respect
admiration
obedience
but
there
was
about
donnegan
something
which
touched
her
in
an
intimate
and
disturbing
manner
she
had
felt
the
flame
which
burned
in
him
in
his
great
moments
it
was
possible
for
her
to
smile
at
donnegan
it
was
possible
even
to
pity
him
for
his
fragility
his
touchy
pride
about
his
size
to
criticize
his
fondness
for
taking
the
center
of
the
stage
even
in
a
cheap
little
mining
camp
like
this
and
strutting
about
the
center
of
all
attention
yet
there
were
qualities
in
him
which
escaped
her
a
possibility
of
metallic
hardness
a
pitiless
fire
of
purpose
to
lord
nick
he
was
as
the
bull
terrier
to
the
mastiff
but
above
all
she
could
not
dislodge
the
memory
of
his
strange
talk
with
her
at
lebrun
not
that
she
did
not
season
the
odd
avowals
of
donnegan
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
even
when
she
had
discounted
all
that
he
said
she
retained
a
quivering
interest
somewhere
beneath
his
words
she
sensed
reality
somewhere
beneath
his
actions
she
felt
a
selfless
willingness
to
throw
himself
away
as
she
rode
she
was
comparing
him
steadily
with
lord
nick
and
as
she
made
the
comparisons
she
felt
more
and
more
assured
that
she
could
pick
and
choose
between
the
two
they
loved
her
both
of
them
with
nick
it
was
an
old
story
with
donnegan
it
might
be
equally
true
in
spite
of
its
newness
and
nelly
lebrun
felt
rich
not
that
she
would
have
been
willing
to
give
up
lord
nick
by
no
means
but
neither
was
she
willing
to
throw
away
donnegan
diamonds
in
one
hand
and
pearls
in
the
other
which
handful
must
she
discard
she
remained
riding
an
unconscionable
length
of
time
and
when
she
drew
rein
again
before
her
father
house
the
black
was
flecked
with
foam
from
his
clamped
bit
and
there
was
a
thick
lather
under
the
stirrup
leathers
she
threw
the
reins
to
the
servant
who
answered
her
call
and
went
slowly
into
the
house
donnegan
by
this
time
was
dead
she
began
to
feel
that
it
would
be
hard
to
look
lord
nick
in
the
face
again
his
other
killings
had
often
seemed
to
her
glorious
she
had
rejoiced
in
the
invincibility
of
her
lover
now
he
suddenly
took
on
the
aspect
of
a
murderer
she
found
the
house
hushed
perhaps
everyone
was
at
the
gaming
house
for
now
it
was
midafternoon
but
when
she
opened
the
door
to
the
apartment
which
they
used
as
a
living
room
she
found
joe
rix
and
the
pedlar
and
lester
sitting
side
by
side
silent
there
was
no
whisky
in
sight
there
were
no
cards
to
be
seen
marvel
of
marvels
these
three
men
were
spending
their
time
in
solemn
thought
a
sudden
thought
rushed
over
her
and
her
cry
told
where
her
heart
really
lay
at
least
at
this
time
lord
nick
has
he
been
the
pedlar
lifted
his
gaunt
head
and
stared
at
her
without
expression
it
was
joe
rix
who
answered
nick
upstairs
safe
not
a
scratch
she
sank
into
a
chair
with
a
sigh
but
was
instantly
on
edge
again
with
the
second
thought
donnegan
she
whispered
safe
and
sound
said
lester
coldly
she
could
not
gather
the
truth
of
the
statement
then
nick
got
landis
back
before
donnegan
returned
no
like
any
other
girl
nelly
lebrun
hated
a
puzzle
above
all
things
in
the
world
at
least
a
puzzle
which
affected
her
new
friends
lester
what
happened
she
demanded
at
this
lester
who
had
been
brooding
upon
the
floor
raised
his
eyes
and
then
switched
one
leg
over
the
other
he
was
a
typical
cowman
was
lester
from
his
crimson
handkerchief
knotted
around
his
throat
to
his
boots
which
fitted
slenderly
about
his
instep
with
the
care
of
a
gloved
hand
i
dunno
what
happened
said
lester
which
looks
like
what
counts
is
the
things
that
did
happen
landis
is
still
with
that
devil
macon
donnegan
is
loose
without
a
scratch
and
lord
nick
is
in
his
room
with
a
face
as
black
as
a
cloudy
night
and
briefly
he
described
how
lord
nick
had
gone
up
the
hill
seen
the
colonel
come
back
taken
a
horse
litter
and
gone
up
the
hill
again
while
the
populace
of
the
corner
waited
for
a
crash
for
donnegan
had
arrived
in
the
meantime
and
how
nick
had
gone
into
the
cabin
remained
a
singularly
long
time
and
then
come
out
with
a
face
half
white
and
half
red
and
an
eye
that
dared
anyone
to
ask
questions
he
had
strode
straight
home
to
lebrun
and
gone
to
his
room
and
there
he
remained
never
making
a
sound
but
i
give
you
my
way
of
readin
the
sign
on
that
trail
said
lester
nick
goes
up
the
hill
to
clean
up
on
donnegan
he
sees
him
they
size
each
other
up
in
a
flash
they
figure
that
if
they
a
gun
it
means
a
double
killin
and
they
simply
haul
off
and
say
a
perlite
the
girl
paid
no
attention
to
these
remarks
she
was
sunk
in
a
brown
study
there
something
behind
it
all
she
said
more
to
herself
than
to
the
men
nick
is
proud
as
the
devil
himself
and
i
ca
imagine
why
let
donnegan
go
oh
it
might
have
been
done
if
they
met
alone
in
the
desert
but
with
the
whole
town
looking
on
and
waiting
for
nick
to
clean
up
on
donnegan
no
it
is
possible
there
must
have
been
a
showdown
of
some
kind
there
was
a
grim
little
silence
after
this
maybe
there
was
said
the
pedlar
dryly
maybe
there
was
a
showdown
and
the
of
it
is
that
nick
comes
home
meek
as
a
broke
down
in
front
she
stared
at
him
first
astonished
and
then
almost
frightened
you
mean
that
nick
may
have
taken
water
the
three
as
one
man
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
met
her
glance
with
cold
eyes
you
fools
cried
the
girl
springing
to
her
feet
he
rather
die
joe
rix
leaned
forward
and
to
emphasize
his
point
he
stabbed
one
dirty
forefinger
into
the
fat
palm
of
his
other
hand
you
just
start
thinkin
back
he
said
solemnly
and
you
remember
that
donnegan
has
done
some
pretty
slick
things
lester
added
with
a
touch
of
contempt
like
shootin
down
landis
one
day
and
then
sittin
down
and
havin
a
nice
long
chat
with
you
the
next
i
dunno
how
he
does
it
that
hunch
of
yours
said
the
girl
fiercely
ought
to
be
roped
and
branded
lie
lester
do
look
at
me
like
that
and
if
you
think
nick
has
lost
his
grip
on
things
you
dead
wrong
step
light
lester
and
the
rest
of
you
or
nick
may
hear
you
walk
and
think
she
flung
out
of
the
room
and
raced
up
the
stairs
to
lord
nick
room
there
was
an
interval
without
response
after
her
first
knock
but
when
she
rapped
again
he
called
out
to
know
who
was
there
at
her
answer
she
heard
his
heavy
stride
cross
the
room
and
the
door
opened
slowly
his
face
as
she
looked
up
to
it
was
so
changed
that
she
hardly
knew
him
his
hair
was
unkempt
on
end
where
he
had
sat
with
his
fingers
thrust
into
it
buried
in
thought
and
the
marks
of
his
palms
were
red
upon
his
forehead
nick
she
whispered
frightened
what
is
it
he
looked
down
half
fiercely
half
sadly
at
her
and
though
his
lips
parted
they
closed
again
before
he
spoke
fear
jumped
coldly
in
nelly
lebrun
did
donnegan
she
pleaded
did
he
did
he
bluff
me
out
finished
nick
no
he
did
that
what
everybody
say
i
know
it
do
i
and
that
why
i
staying
here
by
myself
because
the
first
fool
that
looks
at
me
with
a
question
in
his
face
why
i
break
him
in
two
she
pressed
close
to
him
more
frightened
than
before
that
lord
nick
should
have
been
driven
to
defend
himself
with
words
was
almost
too
much
for
credence
you
know
i
do
believe
it
nick
you
know
that
i
not
doubting
you
but
he
brushed
her
hands
roughly
away
you
want
to
know
what
it
all
about
then
go
over
to
well
to
milligan
donnegan
will
be
there
he
explain
things
to
you
i
guess
he
wants
to
see
you
and
maybe
i
come
over
later
and
join
you
seeing
lord
nick
before
her
so
shaken
so
gray
of
face
so
dull
of
eye
she
pictured
donnegan
as
a
devil
in
human
form
cunning
resistless
nick
dear
she
pleaded
he
closed
the
door
in
her
face
and
she
heard
his
heavy
step
go
back
across
the
room
in
some
mysterious
manner
she
felt
the
promethean
fire
had
been
stolen
from
lord
nick
and
donnegan
was
the
hand
that
had
robbed
him
of
it
it
was
fear
that
nelly
lebrun
felt
first
of
all
it
was
fear
because
the
impossible
had
happened
and
the
immovable
object
had
been
at
last
moved
going
back
to
her
own
room
the
record
of
lord
nick
flashed
across
her
mind
one
long
series
of
thrilling
deeds
he
had
been
a
great
and
widely
known
figure
on
the
mountain
desert
while
she
herself
was
no
more
than
a
girl
when
she
first
met
him
she
had
been
prepared
for
the
sight
of
a
firebreathing
monster
and
she
had
never
quite
recovered
from
the
first
thrill
of
finding
him
not
devil
but
man
quite
oddly
now
that
there
seemed
another
man
as
powerful
as
lord
nick
or
even
more
terrible
she
felt
for
the
big
man
more
tenderly
than
ever
for
like
all
women
there
was
a
corner
of
her
heart
into
which
she
wished
to
receive
a
thing
she
could
cherish
and
protect
lord
nick
the
invincible
had
seemed
without
any
real
need
of
other
human
beings
his
love
for
her
had
seemed
unreal
because
his
need
of
her
seemed
a
superficial
thing
now
that
he
was
in
sorrow
and
defeat
she
suddenly
visualized
a
lord
nick
to
whom
she
could
truly
be
a
helpmate
tears
came
to
her
eyes
at
the
thought
yet
very
contradictorily
and
very
humanly
the
moment
she
was
in
her
room
she
began
preparing
her
toilet
for
that
evening
at
lebrun
let
no
one
think
that
she
was
already
preparing
to
cast
lord
nick
away
and
turn
to
the
new
star
in
the
sky
of
the
mountain
desert
by
no
means
no
doubt
her
own
heart
was
not
quite
clear
to
nelly
indeed
she
put
on
her
most
lovely
gown
with
a
desire
for
revenge
if
lord
nick
had
been
humbled
by
this
singular
donnegan
would
it
not
be
a
perfect
revenge
to
bring
donnegan
himself
to
her
feet
would
it
not
be
a
joy
to
see
him
turn
pale
under
her
smile
and
then
when
he
was
on
his
knees
spurn
the
love
which
he
offered
her
she
set
her
teeth
and
her
eyes
gleamed
with
the
thought
but
nevertheless
she
went
on
lavishing
care
in
the
preparation
for
that
night
as
she
visioned
the
scene
the
many
curious
eyes
that
watched
her
with
donnegan
the
keen
envy
in
the
faces
of
the
women
the
cold
watchfulness
of
the
men
were
what
she
pictured
in
a
way
she
almost
regretted
that
she
was
admired
by
such
fighting
men
landis
lord
nick
and
now
donnegan
who
frightened
away
the
rank
and
file
of
other
admirers
but
it
was
a
pang
which
she
could
readily
control
and
subdue
to
tell
the
truth
the
rest
of
the
day
dragged
through
a
weary
length
at
the
dinner
table
her
father
leaned
to
her
and
talked
in
his
usual
murmuring
voice
which
could
reach
her
own
ear
and
no
other
by
any
chance
nelly
there
going
to
be
the
devil
to
pay
around
the
corner
you
know
why
now
be
a
good
girl
and
wise
girl
and
play
your
cards
donnegan
is
losing
his
head
he
losing
it
over
you
so
play
your
cards
turn
down
nick
and
take
up
donnegan
she
asked
coldly
i
said
enough
already
said
her
father
and
would
not
speak
again
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
already
felt
lord
nick
star
to
be
past
its
full
glory
afterward
lebrun
himself
took
his
daughter
over
to
milligan
and
left
her
under
the
care
of
the
proprietor
i
waiting
for
someone
said
nelly
and
milligan
sat
willingly
at
her
table
and
made
talk
he
was
like
the
rest
of
the
corner
full
of
the
subject
of
the
strange
encounter
between
lord
nick
and
donnegan
what
had
donnegan
done
to
the
big
man
nelly
merely
smiled
and
said
they
would
all
know
in
time
one
thing
was
certain
lord
nick
had
not
taken
water
but
at
this
milligan
smiled
behind
his
hand
ten
minutes
later
there
was
that
stir
which
announced
the
arrival
of
some
public
figures
and
donnegan
with
big
george
behind
him
came
into
the
room
this
evening
he
went
straight
to
the
table
to
nelly
lebrun
milligan
a
little
uneasy
rose
but
donnegan
was
gravely
polite
and
regretted
that
he
had
interrupted
i
have
only
come
to
ask
you
for
five
minutes
of
your
time
he
said
to
the
girl
she
was
about
to
put
him
off
merely
to
make
sure
of
her
hold
over
him
but
something
she
saw
in
his
face
fascinated
her
she
could
not
play
her
game
milligan
had
slipped
away
before
she
knew
it
and
donnegan
was
in
his
place
at
the
table
he
was
as
much
changed
as
lord
nick
she
thought
not
that
his
clothes
were
less
carefully
arranged
than
ever
but
in
the
compression
of
his
lips
and
something
behind
his
eyes
she
felt
the
difference
she
would
have
given
a
great
deal
indeed
to
have
learned
what
went
on
behind
the
door
of
donnegan
shack
when
lord
nick
was
there
last
time
you
asked
for
one
minute
and
stayed
half
an
hour
she
said
this
time
it
five
minutes
no
matter
what
was
on
his
mind
he
was
able
to
answer
fully
as
lightly
when
i
talk
about
myself
i
always
tonight
it
someone
else
yes
she
was
being
a
woman
intensely
disappointed
but
her
smile
was
as
bright
as
ever
of
course
i
listening
you
remember
what
i
told
you
of
landis
and
the
girl
on
the
hill
she
seems
to
stick
in
your
thoughts
mr
donnegan
yes
she
a
lovely
child
and
by
his
frankness
he
very
cunningly
disarmed
her
even
if
he
had
hesitated
an
instant
she
would
have
been
on
the
track
of
the
truth
but
he
had
foreseen
the
question
and
his
reply
came
back
instantly
he
added
also
what
i
say
has
to
do
with
lord
nick
ah
said
the
girl
a
little
coldly
donnegan
went
on
he
had
chosen
frankness
to
be
his
role
and
he
played
it
to
the
full
it
is
a
rather
wonderful
story
he
went
on
you
know
that
lord
nick
went
up
the
hill
for
landis
and
the
corner
was
standing
around
waiting
for
him
to
bring
the
youngster
down
of
course
there
was
only
one
obstacle
which
you
had
so
kindly
removed
myself
for
your
own
sake
mr
donnegan
ah
do
you
suppose
that
i
know
and
his
voice
touched
her
he
came
to
kill
me
and
no
doubt
he
could
have
done
so
such
frankness
shocked
her
into
a
new
attention
perhaps
donnegan
overdid
his
part
a
little
at
this
point
for
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
knew
that
the
little
man
would
a
thousand
times
rather
die
than
give
way
to
any
living
man
but
i
threw
my
case
bodily
before
him
the
girl
her
love
for
landis
and
the
fear
which
revolved
around
your
own
unruly
eyes
you
know
if
he
were
sent
back
to
your
father
house
i
placed
it
all
before
him
at
first
he
was
for
fighting
at
once
but
the
story
appealed
to
him
he
pitied
the
girl
and
in
the
end
he
decided
to
let
the
matter
be
judged
by
a
third
person
he
suggested
a
man
but
i
know
that
a
man
would
see
in
my
attitude
nothing
but
foolishness
no
man
could
have
appreciated
the
position
of
that
girl
on
the
hill
i
myself
named
another
referee
yourself
she
gasped
and
so
i
have
come
to
place
the
question
before
you
because
i
know
that
you
will
decide
honestly
then
i
shall
be
honest
said
the
girl
she
was
thinking
why
not
have
landis
back
it
would
keep
the
three
men
revolving
around
her
landis
on
his
feet
and
well
would
have
been
nothing
either
of
these
men
would
have
killed
him
but
landis
sick
she
might
balance
in
turn
against
them
both
nelly
had
the
instincts
of
a
fencer
she
loved
balance
but
donnegan
was
heaping
up
his
effects
for
by
the
shadow
in
her
eyes
he
well
knew
what
was
passing
through
her
mind
and
he
dared
not
let
her
speak
too
quickly
there
is
more
hanging
upon
it
in
the
first
place
if
landis
is
left
with
the
girl
it
gives
the
colonel
a
chance
to
work
on
him
and
like
as
not
the
colonel
will
get
the
young
fool
to
sign
away
the
mines
to
him
frighten
him
you
see
though
i
made
sure
that
the
colonel
will
not
actually
harm
him
how
have
you
made
sure
they
say
the
colonel
is
a
devil
i
have
spoken
with
him
the
colonel
is
not
altogether
without
sensibility
to
fear
she
caught
the
glint
in
the
little
man
eye
and
she
believed
so
much
for
that
landis
is
safe
but
his
money
may
not
be
another
thing
still
hangs
upon
your
decision
lord
nick
wanted
to
know
why
i
trusted
to
you
because
i
felt
you
were
honest
why
did
i
feel
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
besides
how
could
i
conceal
myself
from
such
a
man
i
spoke
frankly
and
told
him
that
i
trusted
you
because
i
love
you
she
closed
her
hand
hard
on
the
edge
of
the
table
to
steady
herself
and
he
made
no
move
at
you
he
restrained
himself
lord
nick
gasped
the
incredulous
girl
he
is
a
gentleman
said
donnegan
with
a
singular
pride
which
she
could
not
understand
he
went
on
and
unfortunately
i
fear
that
if
you
decide
in
favor
of
my
side
of
the
argument
i
fear
that
lord
nick
will
feel
that
you
that
you
he
was
apparently
unable
to
complete
his
sentence
he
will
feel
that
you
no
longer
care
for
him
said
donnegan
at
length
the
girl
pondered
him
with
cloudy
eyes
what
is
behind
all
this
frankness
she
asked
coldly
i
shall
tell
you
hopelessness
is
behind
it
last
night
i
poured
my
heart
at
your
feet
and
i
had
hope
today
i
have
seen
lord
nick
and
i
no
longer
hope
ah
he
is
worthy
of
a
lovely
woman
affection
and
i
he
called
her
attention
to
himself
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
do
you
ask
me
to
hurt
him
like
this
said
the
girl
his
pride
is
the
pride
of
the
fiend
love
me
he
would
hate
me
it
might
be
true
still
i
know
you
would
risk
it
because
he
paused
well
asked
the
girl
whispering
in
her
excitement
because
you
are
a
lady
he
bowed
to
her
because
you
are
fair
because
you
are
honest
nelly
lebrun
personally
i
think
that
you
can
win
lord
nick
back
with
one
minute
of
smiling
but
you
might
not
you
might
alienate
him
forever
it
will
be
clumsy
to
explain
to
him
that
you
were
influenced
not
by
me
but
by
justice
he
will
make
it
a
personal
matter
whereas
you
and
i
know
that
it
is
only
the
right
that
you
are
seeing
she
propped
her
chin
on
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
her
arm
was
a
thing
of
grace
for
the
last
moments
that
clouded
expression
had
not
cleared
if
i
only
could
read
your
mind
she
murmured
now
there
is
something
behind
it
all
i
shall
tell
you
what
it
is
it
is
the
restraint
that
has
fallen
upon
me
it
is
because
i
wish
to
lean
closer
to
you
across
the
table
and
speak
to
you
of
things
which
are
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
from
landis
and
the
other
girl
it
is
because
i
have
to
keep
my
hands
gripped
hard
to
control
myself
because
though
i
have
given
up
hope
i
would
follow
a
forlorn
chance
a
lost
cause
and
tell
you
again
and
again
that
i
love
you
nelly
lebrun
he
had
half
lowered
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
he
had
called
up
a
vision
and
the
face
of
lou
macon
hovered
dimly
between
him
and
nelly
lebrun
if
all
that
he
spoke
was
a
lie
let
him
be
forgiven
for
it
it
was
the
girl
whom
he
addressed
and
it
was
she
who
gave
the
tremor
and
the
fiber
to
his
voice
and
after
all
was
he
not
pleading
for
her
happiness
as
he
believed
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
but
when
he
looked
up
again
she
could
see
the
shadow
of
the
pain
which
was
slowly
passing
she
had
never
seen
such
emotion
in
any
man
face
and
if
it
was
for
another
how
could
she
guess
it
her
blood
was
singing
in
her
veins
and
the
old
old
question
was
flying
back
and
forth
through
her
brain
like
a
shuttle
through
a
loom
which
shall
it
be
she
called
up
the
picture
of
lord
nick
but
still
terrible
she
well
knew
she
pitied
him
but
when
did
pity
wholly
rule
the
heart
of
a
woman
and
as
for
nelly
lebrun
she
had
the
ambition
of
a
young
caesar
she
could
not
fill
a
second
place
he
who
loved
her
must
stand
first
and
she
saw
donnegan
as
the
invincible
man
she
had
not
believed
half
of
his
explanation
no
he
was
shielding
lord
nick
behind
that
shield
the
truth
was
that
the
big
man
had
quailed
before
the
small
of
course
she
saw
that
donnegan
pretending
to
be
constrained
by
his
agreement
with
lord
nick
was
in
reality
cunningly
pleading
his
own
cause
but
his
passion
excused
him
when
has
a
woman
condemned
a
man
for
loving
her
beyond
the
rules
of
fair
play
whatever
you
may
decide
donnegan
was
saying
i
shall
be
prepared
to
stand
by
it
without
a
murmur
send
landis
back
to
your
father
house
and
i
submit
i
leave
the
corner
and
say
farewell
but
now
think
quickly
for
lord
nick
is
coming
to
receive
your
answer
if
the
meeting
between
lord
nick
and
donnegan
earlier
that
day
had
wrought
up
the
nerves
of
the
corner
to
the
point
of
hysteria
if
the
singular
end
of
that
meeting
had
piled
mystery
upon
excitement
if
the
appearance
of
donnegan
sitting
calmly
at
the
table
of
the
girl
who
was
known
to
be
engaged
to
nick
had
further
stimulated
public
curiosity
the
appearance
of
lord
nick
was
now
a
crowning
burden
under
which
the
corner
staggered
yet
not
a
man
or
a
woman
stirred
from
his
chair
for
everyone
knew
that
if
the
battle
between
these
two
gunfighters
was
at
length
to
take
place
neither
bullet
was
apt
to
fly
astray
but
what
happened
completed
the
wreck
of
the
corner
nerves
for
lord
nick
walked
quietly
across
the
floor
and
sat
down
with
nelly
lebrun
and
his
somber
rival
oddly
enough
he
looked
at
donnegan
not
at
the
girl
and
this
token
of
the
beaten
man
decided
her
well
said
lord
nick
i
have
decided
said
the
girl
landis
should
stay
where
he
is
neither
of
the
two
men
stirred
hand
or
eye
but
lord
nick
turned
gray
at
length
he
rose
and
asked
donnegan
quietly
to
step
aside
with
him
seeing
them
together
the
difference
between
their
sizes
was
more
apparent
donnegan
seemed
hardly
larger
than
a
child
beside
the
splendid
bulk
of
lord
nick
but
she
could
not
overhear
their
talk
you
won
said
lord
nick
both
landis
and
nelly
and
wait
broke
in
donnegan
eagerly
henry
i
persuaded
nelly
to
see
my
side
of
the
case
but
that
does
mean
that
she
has
turned
from
you
to
stop
put
in
lord
nick
between
his
teeth
i
not
come
to
argue
with
you
or
ask
advice
or
opinions
i
come
to
state
facts
crawled
in
between
me
and
nelly
like
a
snake
in
the
grass
very
well
you
my
brother
that
keeps
me
from
handling
you
you
broken
my
reputation
just
as
i
said
you
would
do
the
bouncer
at
the
door
looked
me
in
the
eye
and
smiled
when
i
came
in
he
had
to
pause
a
little
breathing
heavily
and
avoiding
eyes
finally
he
was
able
to
continue
i
going
to
roll
my
blankets
and
leave
the
corner
and
everything
i
have
in
it
you
get
my
share
of
most
things
it
seems
he
smiled
after
a
ghastly
mirthless
fashion
i
give
you
a
free
road
i
surrender
everything
to
you
donnegan
but
there
are
two
things
i
want
to
warn
you
about
it
may
be
that
my
men
will
not
agree
with
me
it
may
be
that
they
want
to
put
up
a
fight
for
the
mine
they
ca
get
at
it
without
getting
at
macon
they
ca
get
at
him
without
removing
you
and
they
probably
try
it
i
warn
you
now
another
thing
from
this
moment
there
no
blood
tie
between
us
found
a
brother
and
lost
him
in
the
same
day
and
if
i
ever
cross
you
again
donnegan
i
shoot
you
on
sight
remember
i
not
threatening
i
simply
warn
you
in
advance
if
i
were
you
i
get
out
of
the
country
avoid
me
donnegan
as
you
avoid
the
devil
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
he
felt
the
eyes
of
the
people
in
the
room
follow
him
by
jerks
dwelling
on
every
one
of
his
steps
near
the
door
stepping
aside
to
avoid
a
group
of
people
coming
in
he
half
turned
and
he
could
not
avoid
the
sight
of
donnegan
and
nelly
lebrun
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
was
leaning
across
the
table
talking
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
at
that
distance
he
could
not
mark
the
pallor
of
the
little
man
face
and
nelly
lebrun
was
laughing
laughing
already
and
oblivious
of
the
rest
of
the
world
lord
nick
turned
a
blur
coming
before
his
eyes
and
made
blindly
for
the
door
a
body
collided
with
him
without
a
word
he
drew
back
his
massive
right
fist
and
knocked
the
man
down
the
stunned
body
struck
against
the
wall
and
collapsed
along
the
floor
lord
nick
felt
a
great
madness
swell
in
his
heart
yet
he
set
his
teeth
controlled
himself
and
went
on
toward
the
house
of
lebrun
he
had
come
within
an
eyelash
of
running
amuck
and
the
quivering
hunger
for
action
was
still
swelling
and
ebbing
in
him
when
he
reached
the
gambler
house
lebrun
was
not
in
the
gaming
house
no
doubt
at
this
time
of
night
but
the
rest
of
nick
chosen
men
were
there
they
stood
up
as
he
entered
the
room
harry
masters
newly
arrived
the
pedlar
joe
rix
three
names
famous
in
the
mountain
desert
for
deeds
which
were
not
altogether
a
pleasant
aroma
in
the
nostrils
of
the
but
whose
sins
had
been
deftly
covered
from
legal
proof
by
the
cunning
of
nick
and
whose
bravery
itself
had
half
redeemed
them
they
rose
now
as
three
wolves
rise
at
the
coming
of
the
leader
but
this
time
there
was
a
question
behind
their
eyes
and
he
read
it
in
gloomy
silence
well
asked
harry
masters
in
the
old
days
not
one
of
them
would
have
dared
to
voice
the
question
but
now
things
were
changing
and
well
lord
nick
could
read
the
change
and
its
causes
are
you
talking
to
me
asked
nick
and
he
looked
straight
between
the
eyes
of
masters
the
glance
of
the
other
did
not
falter
and
it
maddened
nick
i
talking
to
you
said
masters
coolly
enough
what
happened
between
you
and
donnegan
what
should
happen
asked
lord
nick
maybe
all
this
is
a
joke
said
masters
bitterly
he
was
a
man
with
a
square
face
and
a
wrinkled
fleshy
forehead
in
intelligence
nick
ranked
him
first
among
the
men
and
if
a
new
leader
were
to
be
chosen
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
where
the
choice
of
the
men
would
fall
no
doubt
that
was
why
masters
put
himself
forward
now
ready
to
brave
the
wrath
of
the
chief
maybe
we
fooled
went
on
masters
maybe
they
ai
any
call
for
you
to
fall
out
with
donnegan
maybe
there
a
call
to
find
out
this
answered
lord
nick
why
did
you
leave
the
mines
what
are
you
doing
up
here
the
other
swallowed
so
hard
that
he
blinked
i
left
the
mines
he
declared
through
his
set
teeth
because
i
was
run
off
ah
said
lord
nick
for
the
devil
was
rising
in
him
i
always
had
an
idea
that
you
might
be
yellow
masters
the
right
hand
of
masters
swayed
toward
his
gun
hesitated
and
then
poised
idly
you
heard
me
talk
persisted
lord
nick
brutally
i
call
you
yellow
why
do
you
draw
on
me
i
called
you
yellow
you
swine
and
i
call
the
rest
of
you
yellow
you
think
you
have
me
down
why
curse
you
if
there
were
thirty
of
your
cut
i
say
the
same
to
you
there
was
a
quick
shift
the
three
men
faced
lord
nick
but
each
from
a
different
angle
and
opposing
them
he
stood
superbly
indifferent
his
arms
folded
his
feet
braced
his
arms
were
folded
but
each
hand
for
all
they
knew
might
be
grasping
the
butt
of
a
gun
hidden
away
in
his
clothes
once
they
flashed
a
glance
from
face
to
face
but
there
was
no
action
they
were
remembering
only
too
well
some
of
the
wild
deeds
of
this
giant
you
think
i
through
went
on
lord
nick
maybe
i
am
through
with
you
you
hear
me
talk
one
by
one
his
eyes
dared
them
and
one
by
one
they
took
up
the
challenge
struggled
and
lowered
their
glances
he
was
still
their
master
and
in
that
mute
moment
the
three
admitted
it
the
pedlar
last
of
all
masters
saw
fit
to
fall
back
on
the
last
remark
i
swallowed
a
lot
from
you
nick
he
said
gravely
maybe
there
be
an
end
to
what
we
take
one
of
these
days
but
now
i
tell
you
how
yellow
i
was
a
couple
of
gents
come
to
me
and
tell
me
i
through
at
the
mine
i
told
them
they
were
crazy
they
said
old
colonel
macon
had
sent
them
down
to
take
charge
i
laughed
at
they
went
away
and
came
back
who
with
with
the
sheriff
and
he
flashed
a
paper
on
me
it
was
all
drawn
up
clean
as
a
whistle
trimmed
up
with
a
lot
of
and
hereinbefore
mentioned
and
such
like
things
but
the
sheriff
just
gim
me
a
look
and
then
he
tells
me
what
it
about
jack
landis
has
signed
over
all
the
mines
to
the
colonel
and
the
colonel
has
taken
possession
as
he
stopped
a
growl
came
from
the
others
lester
is
the
man
that
has
the
complaint
said
lord
nick
where
do
the
rest
of
you
figure
in
it
lester
had
the
mines
he
lost
because
he
could
drop
landis
with
his
gun
he
never
have
had
a
smell
of
the
gold
if
i
had
come
in
who
made
landis
see
light
i
did
who
worked
it
so
that
every
nickel
that
came
out
of
the
mines
went
through
the
fingers
of
landis
and
came
back
to
us
i
did
but
i
through
with
you
you
can
hunt
for
yourselves
now
i
kept
you
together
to
guard
one
another
backs
i
kept
the
law
off
your
trail
you
masters
have
swung
for
killing
the
mckay
brothers
who
saved
you
who
was
it
bribed
the
jury
that
tried
you
for
the
shooting
up
of
derbyville
pedlar
who
took
the
marshal
off
your
trail
after
you
knifed
lefty
waller
joe
rix
i
saved
you
all
a
dozen
times
now
you
whine
at
me
i
through
with
you
forever
stopping
he
glared
about
him
his
knuckles
stung
from
the
impact
of
the
blow
he
had
delivered
in
milligan
place
he
hungered
to
have
one
of
these
three
stir
a
hand
and
get
into
action
and
they
knew
it
all
at
once
they
crumbled
and
became
clay
in
his
hands
chief
said
joe
rix
the
smoothest
spoken
of
the
lot
and
one
who
was
supposed
to
stand
specially
well
with
lord
nick
on
account
of
his
ability
to
bake
beans
spanish
chief
you
said
a
whole
pile
worth
more
the
rest
of
us
all
rolled
together
sure
we
know
that
there
ai
any
argument
but
here
just
one
little
point
that
i
want
to
make
we
was
doing
fine
the
gold
was
running
fine
and
free
along
comes
this
donnegan
he
busts
up
our
good
time
he
forks
in
on
your
girl
a
convulsion
of
the
chief
face
made
rix
waver
in
his
speech
and
then
he
went
on
he
shoots
landis
and
when
he
misses
killing
him
by
some
accident
he
comes
down
here
and
grabs
him
out
of
lebrun
own
house
smooth
eh
then
he
makes
landis
sign
that
deed
to
the
mines
oh
very
nice
work
i
say
too
nice
speakin
man
to
man
they
ai
any
doubt
that
you
like
to
get
rid
of
donnegan
why
do
you
because
everybody
has
a
jinx
and
yours
i
ai
easy
scared
maybe
but
i
knew
an
albino
with
white
eyes
once
and
just
to
look
at
him
made
me
some
sick
well
chief
they
nobody
can
say
that
you
ever
took
water
or
ever
will
but
maybe
the
fact
that
this
donnegan
has
hair
just
as
plumb
red
as
yours
may
sort
of
get
you
off
your
feed
i
just
suggesting
now
what
i
say
is
let
the
rest
of
us
take
a
crack
at
donnegan
and
you
sit
back
and
come
in
on
the
results
when
we
cleaned
up
give
us
a
free
road
how
much
went
through
the
brain
of
lord
nick
but
in
the
end
he
gave
his
brother
up
to
death
for
he
remembered
how
nelly
lebrun
had
sat
in
milligan
laughing
do
what
you
want
he
said
suddenly
but
i
want
to
know
none
of
your
plans
and
the
man
that
tells
me
donnegan
is
dead
gets
paid
in
lead
the
smile
of
joe
rix
was
the
smile
of
a
diplomat
it
could
be
maintained
upon
his
face
as
unwaveringly
as
if
it
were
wrought
out
of
marble
while
joe
heard
insult
and
lie
as
a
matter
of
fact
joe
had
smiled
in
the
face
of
death
more
than
once
and
this
is
a
school
through
which
even
diplomats
rarely
pass
yet
it
was
with
an
effort
that
he
maintained
the
characteristic
expression
when
the
door
to
donnegan
shack
opened
and
he
saw
big
george
and
beyond
him
donnegan
himself
booze
said
joe
rix
to
himself
instantly
for
donnegan
was
a
wreck
the
unshaven
beard
it
was
the
middle
of
morning
was
a
reddish
mist
over
his
face
his
eyes
were
sunken
in
shadow
his
hair
was
uncombed
he
sat
with
his
shoulders
hunched
up
like
one
who
suffers
from
cold
altogether
his
appearance
was
that
of
one
whose
energy
has
been
utterly
sapped
the
top
of
the
morning
donnegan
said
joe
rix
and
put
his
foot
on
the
threshold
but
since
big
george
did
not
move
it
was
impossible
to
enter
who
there
asked
donnegan
it
was
a
strange
question
to
ask
for
by
raising
his
eyes
he
could
have
seen
but
donnegan
was
staring
down
at
the
floor
even
his
voice
was
a
weak
murmur
what
a
party
what
a
party
he
had
thought
joe
rix
and
after
all
there
was
cause
for
a
celebration
had
not
the
little
man
in
almost
one
stroke
won
the
heart
of
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
corner
and
also
did
he
not
probably
have
a
working
share
in
the
richest
of
the
diggings
i
joe
rix
he
said
joe
rix
murmured
donnegan
softly
then
you
one
of
lord
men
i
was
said
joe
rix
sort
of
attached
to
him
maybe
perhaps
this
pointed
remark
won
the
interest
of
donnegan
he
raised
his
eyes
and
joe
rix
beheld
the
most
unhappy
face
he
had
ever
seen
a
bad
hangover
he
decided
and
that
makes
it
bad
for
me
come
in
said
donnegan
in
the
same
monotonous
lifeless
voice
big
george
reluctantly
it
seemed
withdrew
to
one
side
and
rix
was
instantly
in
the
room
and
drawing
out
a
chair
so
that
he
could
face
donnegan
i
was
he
proceeded
sort
of
tied
up
with
lord
nick
but
and
here
he
winked
broadly
it
ai
much
of
a
secret
that
nick
ai
altogether
a
lord
any
more
nope
seems
he
turned
out
sort
of
common
they
say
what
fool
murmured
donnegan
has
told
you
that
what
ass
had
told
you
that
lord
nick
is
a
common
sort
it
shocked
joe
rix
but
being
a
diplomat
he
avoided
friction
by
changing
his
tactics
between
you
and
me
he
said
calmly
enough
i
took
what
i
heard
with
a
grain
of
salt
there
something
about
nick
that
ai
common
no
matter
what
they
say
besides
they
some
men
that
nobody
but
a
fool
would
stand
up
to
it
ai
hardly
a
shame
for
a
man
to
back
down
from
he
pointed
this
remark
with
a
nod
to
donnegan
i
give
you
a
bit
of
free
information
said
the
little
man
with
his
weary
eyes
lighted
a
little
there
no
man
on
the
face
of
the
earth
who
could
make
lord
nick
back
down
once
more
joe
rix
was
shocked
to
the
verge
of
gaping
but
again
he
exercised
a
power
of
marvelous
self
control
about
that
he
remarked
as
pointedly
as
before
i
got
my
doubts
because
there
some
things
that
any
gent
with
sense
will
always
clear
away
from
maybe
not
one
man
but
say
a
bunch
of
all
standin
together
donnegan
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
waited
both
of
his
hands
remained
drooping
from
the
edge
of
the
table
and
the
tired
eyes
drifted
slowly
across
the
face
of
joe
rix
it
was
obviously
not
the
aftereffects
of
liquor
the
astonishing
possibility
occurred
to
joe
rix
that
this
seemed
to
be
a
man
with
a
broken
spirit
and
a
great
sorrow
he
blinked
that
absurdity
away
coming
to
cases
he
went
on
there
yourself
donnegan
now
you
the
sort
of
a
man
that
do
sidestep
nobody
too
proud
to
do
it
but
even
you
i
guess
would
step
careful
if
there
was
a
whole
bunch
agin
you
no
doubt
remarked
donnegan
i
do
mean
any
ordinary
bunch
explained
joe
rix
but
a
lot
of
hard
fellows
gents
that
handle
their
guns
like
they
was
born
with
a
holster
on
the
hip
fellows
like
nick
crowd
suggested
donnegan
quietly
at
this
thrust
the
eyes
of
joe
narrowed
a
little
yes
he
admitted
i
see
you
get
my
drift
i
think
so
two
hard
fighters
would
give
the
best
man
that
ever
pulled
a
gun
a
lot
of
trouble
eh
no
doubt
and
three
men
they
ai
any
question
donnegan
would
get
him
ready
for
a
hole
in
the
ground
i
suppose
so
and
four
men
would
make
it
no
fight
jest
a
plain
butchery
yes
now
i
do
mean
that
nick
crowd
has
any
hard
feeling
about
you
mr
donnegan
i
glad
to
hear
that
i
knew
you
be
that
why
i
come
all
friendly
to
talk
things
over
suppose
you
look
at
it
this
way
joe
rix
broke
in
donnegan
sighing
i
very
tired
wo
you
cut
this
short
tell
me
in
ten
words
just
how
you
stand
joe
rix
blinked
once
more
caught
his
breath
and
fired
his
volley
short
talk
is
straight
talk
mostly
he
declared
this
is
what
lester
and
the
rest
of
us
want
the
mines
ah
macon
stole
we
got
back
through
landis
now
we
got
to
get
back
through
the
colonel
himself
but
we
ca
get
at
the
colonel
while
you
around
in
short
you
going
to
start
out
to
get
me
i
expected
it
but
kind
of
you
to
warn
me
wait
wait
wait
do
rush
along
to
conclusions
we
ai
so
much
in
a
hurry
we
do
want
you
out
of
the
way
we
just
want
you
on
our
side
shoot
me
up
and
then
bring
me
back
to
life
eh
donnegan
said
the
other
spreading
out
his
hands
solemnly
on
the
table
you
ai
doin
us
justice
we
do
hanker
none
for
trouble
with
you
any
way
it
comes
a
fight
with
you
means
somebody
dead
besides
you
we
get
you
four
to
one
is
too
much
for
any
man
but
one
or
two
of
us
might
go
down
who
would
it
be
maybe
the
pedlar
maybe
harry
masters
maybe
lester
maybe
me
oh
we
know
all
that
no
gunplay
if
we
can
keep
away
from
it
you
left
out
the
name
of
lord
nick
said
donnegan
joe
rix
winked
seems
like
you
tended
to
him
once
and
for
all
when
you
got
him
alone
in
this
cabin
must
have
thrown
a
mighty
big
scare
into
him
he
wo
lift
a
hand
agin
you
now
no
murmured
donnegan
hoarsely
not
him
but
that
leaves
four
of
us
and
four
is
plenty
eh
perhaps
but
i
not
here
to
insist
on
that
point
no
we
put
a
value
on
up
good
feeling
between
us
and
you
donnegan
we
ai
fools
we
know
a
man
when
we
see
him
and
the
fastest
gunman
that
ever
slid
a
gun
out
of
leather
ai
the
sort
of
a
man
that
me
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
pass
over
lightly
not
us
we
know
you
donnegan
we
respect
you
we
want
you
with
us
we
going
to
have
you
with
us
you
flatter
me
and
i
thank
you
but
i
glad
to
see
that
you
are
at
last
coming
to
the
point
i
am
and
the
point
is
five
thousand
dollars
that
tied
behind
the
hoss
that
stands
outside
your
door
he
pushed
his
fat
hand
a
little
way
across
the
table
as
though
the
gold
even
then
were
resting
in
it
a
yellow
tide
of
fortune
for
which
said
donnegan
i
to
step
aside
and
let
you
at
the
colonel
right
donnegan
smiled
wait
said
joe
rix
i
was
makin
a
first
offer
to
see
how
you
stood
but
you
right
five
thousand
ai
enough
and
we
ai
cheapskates
not
us
donnegan
they
ten
thousand
cold
iron
men
behind
that
saddle
out
there
and
every
cent
of
it
belongs
to
you
when
you
come
over
on
our
side
but
donnegan
merely
dropped
his
chin
upon
his
hand
and
smiled
mirthlessly
at
joe
rix
a
wild
thought
came
to
the
other
man
both
of
donnegan
hands
were
far
from
his
weapons
why
not
a
quick
draw
a
snap
shot
and
then
the
glory
of
having
killed
this
manslayer
in
single
battle
for
joe
rix
the
thought
rushed
red
across
his
brain
and
then
faded
slowly
something
kept
him
back
perhaps
it
was
the
singular
calm
of
donnegan
no
matter
how
quiet
he
sat
he
suggested
the
sleeping
cat
which
can
leap
out
of
dead
sleep
into
fighting
action
at
a
touch
by
the
time
a
second
thought
had
come
to
joe
rix
the
idea
of
an
attack
was
like
an
idea
of
suicide
is
that
final
he
asked
though
donnegan
had
not
said
a
word
it
is
joe
rix
stood
up
you
put
it
to
us
kind
of
hard
but
we
want
you
donnegan
and
here
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
come
over
to
us
we
stand
behind
you
lord
nick
is
slipping
we
put
you
in
his
place
you
even
have
to
face
him
we
get
rid
of
him
you
kill
him
and
give
his
place
to
me
asked
donnegan
we
will
and
when
you
with
us
you
cut
in
on
the
whole
amount
of
coin
that
the
mines
turn
out
and
it
be
something
tidy
and
right
now
to
show
where
we
stand
and
how
high
we
put
you
i
let
you
in
on
the
truth
donnegan
out
there
tied
behind
my
saddle
there
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
pure
gold
you
can
take
it
in
here
and
weigh
it
out
he
stepped
back
to
watch
this
blow
take
effect
to
his
unutterable
astonishment
the
little
man
had
not
moved
his
chin
still
rested
upon
the
back
of
his
hand
and
the
smile
which
was
on
the
lips
and
not
in
the
eyes
of
donnegan
remained
there
fixed
donnegan
muttered
joe
rix
if
we
ca
get
you
we
get
rid
of
you
you
understand
but
the
other
continued
to
smile
it
gave
joe
rix
a
shuddering
feeling
that
someone
was
stealing
behind
him
to
block
his
way
to
the
door
he
cast
one
swift
glance
over
his
shoulder
and
then
seeing
that
the
way
was
clear
he
slunk
back
always
keeping
his
face
to
the
man
but
when
he
came
to
the
doorway
his
nerve
collapsed
he
whirled
covered
the
rest
of
the
distance
with
a
leap
and
emerged
from
the
cabin
in
a
fashion
ludicrously
like
one
who
has
been
kicked
through
a
door
his
nerve
returned
as
soon
as
the
sunlight
fell
warmly
upon
him
again
and
he
looked
around
hastily
to
see
if
anyone
had
observed
his
flight
there
was
no
one
on
the
whole
hillside
except
colonel
macon
in
the
invalid
chair
and
the
colonel
was
smiling
broadly
beneficently
he
had
his
perfect
hands
folded
across
his
breast
and
seemed
to
cast
a
prayer
of
peace
and
goodwill
upon
joe
rix
nelly
lebrun
smelled
danger
she
sensed
it
as
plainly
as
the
deer
when
the
puma
comes
between
her
and
the
wind
the
many
tokens
that
something
was
wrong
came
to
her
by
small
hints
which
had
to
be
put
together
before
they
assumed
any
importance
first
of
all
her
father
who
should
have
burst
out
at
her
in
a
tirade
for
having
left
lord
nick
for
donnegan
said
nothing
at
all
but
kept
a
dark
smile
on
his
face
when
she
was
near
him
he
even
insinuated
that
nick
time
was
done
and
that
another
was
due
to
supersede
him
in
the
second
place
she
had
passed
into
a
room
where
masters
joe
rix
and
the
pedlar
sat
cheek
by
jowl
in
close
conference
with
a
hum
of
deep
voice
but
at
her
appearance
all
talk
was
broken
off
it
was
not
strange
that
they
should
not
invite
her
into
their
confidence
if
they
had
some
dark
work
ahead
of
them
but
it
was
exceedingly
suspicious
that
joe
rix
attempted
to
pass
off
their
whispers
by
immediately
breaking
off
the
soft
talk
and
springing
into
the
midst
of
a
jest
also
it
was
strangest
of
all
that
when
the
jest
ended
even
the
pedlar
who
rarely
smiled
now
laughed
uproariously
and
smote
joe
soundingly
upon
the
back
even
a
child
could
have
strung
these
incidents
into
a
chain
of
evidence
which
pointed
toward
danger
obviously
the
danger
was
not
directly
hers
but
then
it
must
be
directed
at
some
one
near
to
her
her
father
no
he
was
more
apt
to
be
the
mainspring
of
their
action
lord
nick
there
was
nothing
to
gain
by
attacking
him
who
was
left
donnegan
as
the
realization
came
upon
her
it
took
her
breath
away
for
a
moment
donnegan
was
the
man
at
breakfast
everyone
had
been
talking
about
him
lebrun
had
remarked
that
he
had
a
face
for
the
cards
emotionless
joe
rix
had
commented
upon
his
speed
of
hand
and
the
pedlar
had
complimented
the
little
man
on
his
dress
but
at
lunch
not
a
word
was
spoken
about
donnegan
even
after
she
had
dexterously
introduced
the
subject
twice
why
the
sudden
silence
between
morning
and
noon
donnegan
must
have
grievously
offended
them
fear
for
his
sake
stimulated
her
but
above
and
beyond
this
indeed
there
was
a
mighty
feminine
curiosity
she
smelled
the
secret
it
reeked
through
the
house
and
she
was
devoured
by
eagerness
to
know
she
handpicked
lord
nick
gang
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
weakness
among
them
some
weakness
upon
which
she
could
play
in
one
of
them
and
draw
out
what
they
were
all
concealing
the
pedlar
was
as
unapproachable
as
a
crag
on
a
mountaintop
masters
was
wise
as
an
outlaw
broncho
lester
was
probably
not
even
in
the
confidence
of
the
others
because
since
the
affair
with
landis
his
nerve
had
been
shattered
to
bits
and
the
others
secretly
despised
him
for
being
beaten
by
the
youngster
at
the
draw
there
remained
therefore
only
joe
rix
but
joe
rix
was
a
fox
of
the
first
quality
he
lied
with
the
smoothness
of
silk
he
could
show
a
dozen
colors
in
as
many
moments
come
to
the
windward
of
joe
rix
it
was
a
delicate
business
but
since
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
she
fixed
her
mind
upon
it
working
out
this
puzzle
joe
rix
wished
to
destroy
donnegan
for
reasons
that
were
evidently
connected
with
the
mines
and
she
must
step
into
his
confidence
to
discover
his
plans
how
should
it
be
done
and
there
was
a
vital
need
for
speed
for
they
might
be
within
a
step
of
executing
whatever
mischief
it
was
that
they
were
planning
she
went
down
from
her
room
they
were
there
still
only
joe
rix
was
not
with
them
she
went
to
the
apartment
where
he
and
the
other
three
of
nick
gang
slept
and
rapped
at
the
door
he
maintained
his
smile
when
he
saw
her
but
there
was
an
uncertain
quiver
of
his
eyebrows
that
told
her
much
plainly
he
was
ill
at
ease
suspicious
ay
there
were
always
clouds
of
suspicion
drifting
over
the
red
round
face
of
joe
rix
she
put
a
tremor
of
excitement
and
trouble
in
her
voice
come
into
my
room
joe
where
we
wo
be
interrupted
he
followed
her
without
a
word
and
since
she
led
the
way
she
was
able
to
relax
her
expression
for
a
necessary
moment
when
she
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
faced
joe
again
she
was
once
more
ready
to
step
into
her
part
she
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
she
remained
for
a
moment
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
and
searched
the
face
of
joe
rix
eagerly
do
you
think
he
can
hear
she
whispered
gesturing
over
her
shoulder
who
who
but
lord
nick
she
exclaimed
softly
the
bewilderment
of
joe
clouded
his
face
a
second
and
then
he
was
able
to
smooth
it
away
what
on
earth
was
the
reason
of
her
concern
about
lord
nick
he
was
obviously
wondering
i
tell
you
why
she
said
answering
the
unspoken
question
at
once
he
as
jealous
as
the
devil
joe
the
fat
little
man
sighed
as
he
looked
at
her
he
ca
hear
not
through
that
log
wall
but
we
talk
soft
if
you
want
yes
yes
keep
your
voice
down
he
already
jealous
of
you
joe
of
me
he
knows
i
like
you
that
i
trust
you
and
just
now
he
on
edge
about
everyone
i
look
at
the
surprising
news
which
the
first
part
of
this
sentence
contained
caused
joe
to
gape
and
the
girl
looked
away
in
concern
enabling
him
to
control
his
expression
for
she
knew
well
enough
that
men
hate
to
appear
foolishly
surprised
and
particularly
a
fox
like
joe
rix
but
what
the
trouble
nelly
he
added
with
a
touch
of
venom
i
thought
everything
was
going
smoothly
with
you
and
i
thought
you
were
worrying
much
about
what
lord
nick
had
in
his
mind
she
stared
at
him
as
though
astonished
do
you
think
just
the
same
as
the
rest
of
them
she
asked
sadly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
fooled
just
the
same
as
harry
masters
and
the
pedlar
and
the
rest
of
those
fools
including
nick
himself
joe
rix
was
by
no
means
willing
to
declare
himself
a
fool
beforehand
he
now
mustered
a
look
of
much
reserved
wisdom
i
have
my
own
doubts
nell
but
i
not
talking
about
them
he
was
so
utterly
at
sea
that
she
had
to
bite
her
lip
hard
to
keep
from
breaking
into
ringing
laughter
oh
i
knew
that
you
seen
through
it
joe
she
cried
softly
you
see
what
an
awful
mess
i
gotten
into
he
passed
a
hurried
hand
across
his
forehead
and
then
looked
at
her
searchingly
but
he
could
not
penetrate
her
pretense
of
concern
no
matter
what
i
think
said
joe
rix
you
come
out
with
it
frankly
i
listen
as
a
friend
joe
she
managed
to
throw
a
plea
into
her
voice
that
made
joe
sigh
sure
you
already
said
that
i
your
friend
and
you
right
i
in
terrible
terrible
trouble
you
know
how
it
happened
i
was
a
fool
i
tried
to
play
with
lord
nick
and
now
he
thinks
i
was
in
earnest
as
though
the
strength
of
his
legs
had
given
way
joe
rix
slipped
down
into
a
chair
go
on
he
said
huskily
you
were
playing
with
lord
nick
ca
you
put
yourself
in
my
place
joe
it
always
been
taken
for
granted
that
i
to
marry
nick
and
the
moment
he
comes
around
everybody
else
avoids
me
as
if
i
were
poison
i
was
sick
of
it
and
when
he
showed
up
this
time
it
was
the
same
old
story
a
man
would
as
soon
sign
his
own
death
warrant
as
ask
me
for
a
dance
you
know
how
it
is
he
nodded
still
at
sea
but
with
a
light
beginning
to
dawn
in
his
little
eyes
i
only
a
girl
joe
i
have
all
the
weakness
of
other
girls
i
want
to
be
locked
up
in
a
cage
just
because
i
love
one
man
the
avowal
made
joe
blink
it
was
the
second
time
that
day
that
he
had
been
placed
in
an
astonishing
scene
but
some
of
his
old
cunning
remained
to
him
nell
he
said
suddenly
rising
from
his
chair
and
going
to
her
what
are
you
trying
to
do
to
me
pull
the
wool
over
my
eyes
it
was
too
much
for
nelly
lebrun
she
knew
that
she
could
not
face
him
without
betraying
her
guilt
and
therefore
she
did
not
attempt
it
she
whirled
and
flung
herself
on
her
bed
face
down
and
began
to
sob
violently
suppressing
the
sounds
and
so
she
waited
presently
a
hand
touched
her
shoulder
lightly
go
away
cried
nelly
in
a
choked
voice
i
hate
you
joe
rix
like
all
the
rest
his
knee
struck
the
floor
with
a
soft
thud
come
on
nell
do
be
hard
on
me
i
thought
you
were
stringing
me
a
little
but
if
you
playing
straight
tell
me
what
you
want
at
that
she
bounced
upright
on
the
bed
and
before
he
could
rise
she
caught
him
by
both
shoulders
i
want
donnegan
she
said
fiercely
what
i
want
him
dead
joe
rix
gasped
here
the
cause
of
all
my
trouble
just
because
i
flirted
with
him
once
or
twice
nick
thought
i
was
in
earnest
and
now
he
sulking
and
donnegan
puts
on
airs
and
acts
as
if
i
belonged
to
him
i
hate
him
joe
and
if
he
gone
nick
will
come
back
to
me
he
come
back
to
me
joe
and
i
want
him
so
she
found
that
joe
rix
was
staring
straight
into
her
eyes
striving
to
probe
her
soul
to
its
depths
and
by
a
great
effort
she
was
enabled
to
meet
that
gaze
finally
the
fat
little
man
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
her
hands
trailed
from
his
shoulders
as
he
stood
up
and
fell
helplessly
upon
her
lap
well
i
be
hanged
nell
exclaimed
joe
rix
what
do
you
mean
you
not
acting
a
part
no
i
can
see
you
mean
it
but
what
a
little
he
checked
himself
his
face
was
suddenly
jubilant
then
we
got
him
nell
we
got
him
if
you
with
us
we
had
him
anyway
but
we
make
sure
of
him
if
you
with
us
look
at
this
you
saw
me
put
a
paper
in
my
pocket
when
i
opened
the
door
of
my
room
here
it
is
he
displayed
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
nelly
lebrun
a
paper
covered
with
an
exact
duplicate
of
her
own
swift
dainty
script
and
she
read
nick
is
terribly
angry
and
is
making
trouble
i
have
to
get
away
it
is
safe
for
me
to
stay
here
will
you
help
me
will
you
meet
me
at
the
shack
by
donnell
ford
tomorrow
morning
at
ten
but
i
did
write
it
cried
nelly
lebrun
bewildered
nelly
joe
rix
chuckled
flushing
with
pleasure
you
did
it
was
me
i
kind
of
had
an
idea
that
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
this
donnegan
and
i
was
going
to
do
it
for
you
and
then
surprise
you
with
the
good
news
joe
you
forged
it
do
bother
sayin
pretty
things
about
me
and
my
pen
said
rix
modestly
this
is
nothin
but
if
you
want
to
help
me
nelly
his
voice
faded
partly
out
of
her
consciousness
as
she
fought
against
a
tigerish
desire
to
spring
at
the
throat
of
the
little
fat
man
but
gradually
it
dawned
on
her
that
he
was
asking
her
to
write
out
that
note
herself
why
because
it
was
possible
that
donnegan
might
have
seen
her
handwriting
and
in
that
case
though
the
imitation
had
been
good
enough
to
deceive
nelly
herself
it
probably
would
not
for
a
moment
fool
the
keen
eyes
of
donnegan
but
if
she
herself
wrote
out
the
note
donnegan
was
already
as
good
as
dead
that
is
concluded
joe
rix
if
he
really
loves
you
nell
the
fool
cried
nelly
he
worships
the
ground
i
walk
on
joe
and
i
hate
him
for
it
even
joe
rix
shivered
for
he
saw
the
hate
in
her
eyes
and
could
not
dream
that
he
himself
was
the
cause
and
the
object
of
it
there
was
a
red
haze
of
horror
and
confusion
in
front
of
her
eyes
and
yet
she
was
able
to
smile
while
she
copied
the
note
for
joe
rix
but
how
are
you
going
to
work
it
she
asked
how
are
you
going
to
kill
him
joe
do
bother
your
pretty
head
said
the
fat
man
smiling
just
wait
till
we
bring
you
the
good
news
but
are
you
sure
she
asked
eagerly
see
what
he
done
already
taken
landis
away
from
us
he
baffled
nick
himself
in
some
manner
and
he
gathered
the
mines
away
from
all
of
us
he
a
devil
joe
and
if
you
want
to
get
him
you
better
take
ten
men
for
the
job
you
hate
him
nell
do
you
queried
joe
rix
and
his
voice
was
both
hard
and
curious
but
how
has
he
harmed
you
has
he
taken
nick
away
from
me
is
that
enough
the
fat
man
shivered
again
all
right
i
tell
you
how
it
works
now
listen
and
he
began
to
check
off
the
details
of
his
plan
the
day
passed
and
the
night
but
how
very
slowly
for
nelly
lebrun
she
went
up
to
her
room
early
for
she
could
no
longer
bear
the
meaning
glances
which
joe
rix
cast
at
her
from
time
to
time
but
once
in
her
room
it
was
still
harder
to
bear
the
suspense
as
she
waited
for
the
noise
to
die
away
in
the
house
midnight
and
half
an
hour
more
went
by
and
then
at
last
the
murmurs
and
the
laughter
stopped
she
alone
was
wakeful
in
lebrun
and
when
that
time
came
she
caught
a
scarf
around
her
hair
and
her
shoulders
made
of
a
filmy
material
which
would
veil
her
face
but
through
which
she
could
see
and
ventured
out
of
her
room
and
down
the
hall
there
was
no
particular
need
for
such
caution
however
it
seemed
nothing
stirred
and
presently
she
was
outside
the
house
and
hurrying
behind
the
houses
and
up
the
hill
still
she
met
nothing
if
the
corner
lived
tonight
its
life
was
confined
to
milligan
and
the
gambling
house
she
found
donnegan
shack
and
the
one
next
to
it
which
the
terrible
colonel
occupied
entirely
dark
but
only
a
moment
after
she
tapped
at
the
door
it
was
opened
donnegan
fully
dressed
stood
in
the
entrance
outlined
blackly
by
the
light
which
came
faintly
from
the
hooded
lantern
hanging
on
the
wall
was
he
sitting
up
all
the
night
unable
to
sleep
because
he
waited
breathlessly
for
that
false
tryst
on
the
morrow
a
great
tenderness
came
over
the
heart
of
nelly
lebrun
it
is
i
she
whispered
there
was
a
soft
exclamation
then
she
was
drawn
into
the
room
is
there
anyone
here
only
big
george
but
he
in
the
kitchen
and
he
wo
hear
he
never
hears
anything
except
what
meant
for
his
ear
take
this
chair
he
was
putting
a
blanket
over
the
rough
wood
to
make
it
more
comfortable
and
she
submitted
dumbly
to
his
ministrations
it
seemed
terrible
and
strange
to
her
that
one
so
gentle
should
be
the
object
of
so
much
hate
such
deadly
hate
as
the
members
of
nick
gang
felt
for
him
and
now
that
he
was
sitting
before
her
she
could
see
that
he
had
indeed
been
wakeful
for
a
long
time
his
face
was
grimly
wasted
the
lips
were
compressed
as
one
who
has
endured
long
pain
and
his
eyes
gleamed
at
her
out
of
a
profound
shadow
he
remained
in
the
gloom
the
light
from
the
lantern
fell
brightly
upon
his
hands
alone
meager
fleshless
hands
which
seemed
to
represent
hardly
more
strength
than
that
of
a
child
truly
this
man
was
all
a
creature
of
spirit
and
nerve
therein
lay
his
strength
as
also
his
weakness
and
again
the
cherishing
instinct
grew
strong
and
swept
over
her
there
is
no
one
near
he
said
except
the
colonel
and
his
daughter
they
are
up
the
hillside
somewhere
did
you
see
them
no
what
in
the
world
are
they
out
for
at
this
time
of
night
because
the
colonel
only
wakes
up
when
the
sun
goes
down
and
now
out
there
humming
to
himself
and
never
speaking
a
word
to
the
girl
but
they
wo
be
far
away
they
stay
close
to
see
that
no
one
comes
near
the
cabin
to
get
at
landis
he
added
they
must
have
seen
you
come
into
my
cabin
and
his
lips
set
even
harder
than
before
was
it
fear
because
of
her
they
may
have
seen
me
enter
but
they
wo
know
who
it
was
you
have
the
note
from
me
yes
it
a
lie
it
a
ruse
i
was
forced
to
write
it
to
save
you
for
they
planning
to
murder
you
oh
my
dear
hush
hush
murder
i
been
nearly
hysterical
all
day
and
all
the
night
but
thank
heaven
i
here
to
warn
you
in
time
you
must
go
you
must
go
who
is
it
he
had
drawn
his
chair
closer
he
had
taken
her
hands
and
she
noted
that
his
own
were
icy
cold
but
steady
as
a
rock
their
pressure
soothed
her
infinitely
joe
rix
the
pedlar
harry
masters
they
be
at
the
shack
at
ten
but
not
i
murder
but
a
very
clumsy
scheme
three
men
leave
town
and
commit
a
murder
and
then
expect
to
go
undetected
not
even
in
the
mountain
desert
but
you
do
understand
you
do
understand
they
wise
as
foxes
they
take
no
risk
they
do
even
leave
town
together
or
travel
by
the
same
routes
harry
masters
starts
first
he
rides
out
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
takes
the
north
trail
he
rides
down
the
gulch
and
winds
out
of
it
and
strikes
for
the
shack
at
the
ford
at
half
past
eight
the
pedlar
starts
he
goes
past
sandy
place
and
then
over
the
trail
through
the
marsh
you
know
it
yes
last
of
all
joe
rix
starts
at
nine
half
an
hour
between
them
how
does
he
go
to
the
shack
by
the
south
trail
he
takes
the
ridge
of
the
hills
but
they
all
be
at
the
shack
long
before
you
and
they
shoot
you
down
from
a
distance
as
you
come
up
to
it
plain
murder
but
even
for
cowardly
murder
they
dare
face
you
except
three
to
one
he
was
thoughtful
suppose
they
were
to
be
met
on
the
way
you
mad
to
think
of
it
but
if
they
fail
this
time
they
try
again
they
must
be
taught
a
lesson
three
men
oh
my
dear
my
dear
promise
very
well
i
shall
do
nothing
rash
and
i
shall
never
forget
that
you
come
to
tell
me
this
and
been
in
peril
nell
for
if
they
found
you
had
come
to
me
the
pedlar
would
cut
my
throat
i
know
him
ah
but
now
you
must
go
i
take
you
down
the
hill
dear
no
no
it
much
easier
to
get
back
alone
my
face
will
be
covered
but
there
no
way
you
could
be
disguised
you
have
a
way
of
walking
good
night
and
god
bless
you
she
was
in
his
arms
straining
him
to
her
and
then
she
slipped
out
the
door
and
sure
enough
there
was
the
colonel
in
his
chair
not
fifty
feet
away
with
a
girl
pushing
him
the
moonlight
was
too
dim
for
nelly
lebrun
to
make
out
the
face
of
lou
macon
but
even
the
light
which
escaped
through
the
filter
of
clouds
was
enough
to
set
her
golden
hair
glowing
the
color
was
not
apparent
but
its
luster
was
soft
silver
in
the
night
there
was
a
murmur
of
the
colonel
voice
as
nelly
came
out
of
the
cabin
and
then
from
the
girl
a
low
cry
it
brought
the
blood
to
the
cheeks
of
nelly
as
she
hurried
down
the
hill
for
she
recognized
the
pain
that
was
in
it
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
if
the
girl
was
in
love
with
jack
landis
she
was
strangely
interested
in
donnegan
also
the
thought
came
so
sharply
home
to
her
that
she
paused
abruptly
on
the
way
down
the
hill
after
all
this
macon
girl
would
be
a
very
strange
sort
if
she
were
not
impressed
by
the
little
man
with
his
gentle
voice
and
his
fiery
ways
and
his
easy
way
of
making
himself
a
brilliant
spectacle
whenever
he
appeared
in
public
and
nelly
remembered
also
with
the
keen
suspicion
of
a
woman
in
love
how
weakly
donnegan
had
responded
to
her
embrace
this
night
how
his
arms
had
held
her
and
how
numbly
they
had
fallen
away
when
she
turned
at
the
door
but
she
shook
her
head
and
made
the
suspicion
shudder
its
way
out
of
her
lou
macon
she
decided
was
just
the
sort
of
girl
who
would
think
jack
landis
an
ideal
besides
she
had
never
had
an
opportunity
to
see
donnegan
in
his
full
glory
at
milligan
and
as
for
donnegan
he
was
wearied
out
his
nerves
relaxed
and
for
the
deeds
with
which
he
had
startled
the
corner
and
won
her
own
heart
he
was
now
paying
the
penalty
in
the
shape
of
ruined
nerves
pity
again
swelled
in
her
heart
and
a
consuming
hatred
for
the
three
murderers
who
lived
in
her
house
and
when
she
reached
her
room
again
her
heart
was
filled
with
a
singing
happiness
and
a
glorious
knowledge
that
she
had
saved
the
man
she
loved
and
donnegan
himself
he
had
seen
lou
and
her
father
he
had
heard
that
low
cry
of
pain
and
now
he
sat
bowed
again
over
his
table
his
face
in
his
hands
and
a
raging
devil
in
his
heart
there
was
one
complication
which
nelly
lebrun
might
have
foreseen
after
her
pretended
change
of
heart
and
her
simulated
confession
to
joe
rix
that
she
still
loved
the
lionlike
lord
nick
but
strangely
enough
she
did
not
think
of
this
phase
and
even
when
her
father
the
next
morning
approached
her
in
the
hall
and
tapping
her
arm
whispered
good
girl
nick
has
just
heard
and
he
hunting
for
you
now
even
then
the
full
meaning
did
not
come
home
to
her
it
was
not
until
she
saw
the
great
form
of
lord
nick
stalking
swiftly
down
the
hall
that
she
knew
he
came
with
a
glory
in
his
face
which
the
last
day
had
graven
with
unfamiliar
lines
and
when
he
saw
her
he
threw
up
his
hand
so
that
it
almost
brushed
the
ceiling
and
cried
out
what
could
she
do
try
to
push
him
away
to
explain
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
she
had
to
submit
when
he
swept
her
into
his
arms
rix
has
told
me
rix
has
told
me
ah
nell
you
little
fox
told
you
what
nick
was
he
too
a
party
to
the
murderous
plan
but
he
allowed
himself
to
be
pushed
away
i
gone
through
something
in
the
last
few
days
why
did
you
do
it
girl
she
saw
suddenly
that
she
must
continue
to
play
her
part
some
day
i
tell
you
why
it
was
that
i
gave
you
up
so
easily
nell
you
thought
i
was
afraid
of
donnegan
he
ground
his
teeth
and
turned
pale
at
the
thought
but
that
was
it
some
day
i
can
tell
you
but
after
this
the
first
man
who
comes
between
us
donnegan
or
any
other
i
turn
him
into
powder
under
my
heel
he
ground
it
into
the
floor
as
he
spoke
she
decided
that
she
would
see
how
much
he
knew
it
will
never
be
donnegan
at
least
she
said
he
done
for
today
and
i
almost
sorry
for
him
in
spite
of
all
that
he
done
he
became
suddenly
grave
what
are
you
saying
nell
why
joe
told
you
did
he
they
drawn
donnegan
out
of
town
and
now
they
lying
in
wait
for
him
yes
they
must
have
him
by
this
time
it
ten
a
strangely
tense
exclamation
broke
from
lord
nick
they
gone
for
donnegan
yes
are
you
angry
the
big
man
staggered
one
would
have
said
that
he
had
been
stunned
with
a
blow
garry
he
whispered
what
are
you
saying
nell
he
muttered
hoarsely
did
you
know
about
it
but
i
did
it
for
you
nick
i
knew
you
hated
no
no
do
say
it
he
added
bitterly
after
a
moment
this
is
for
my
sins
and
then
to
her
but
you
knew
about
it
and
did
warn
him
you
hated
him
all
the
time
you
were
laughing
with
him
and
smiling
at
him
oh
nell
what
a
merciless
witch
of
a
woman
you
are
for
the
rest
of
them
i
wait
till
they
come
back
what
are
you
going
to
do
nick
i
told
them
i
pay
the
man
who
killed
donnegan
with
lead
did
the
fools
think
i
did
mean
it
truly
no
matter
what
shadow
had
passed
over
the
big
man
he
was
the
lion
again
and
nell
shrank
from
him
we
wait
for
them
he
said
we
wait
for
them
here
and
they
sat
down
together
in
the
room
she
attempted
to
speak
once
in
a
shaken
voice
but
he
silenced
her
with
a
gesture
and
after
that
she
sat
and
watched
in
quiet
the
singular
play
of
varying
expressions
across
his
face
grief
rage
tenderness
murderous
hate
they
followed
like
a
puppet
play
what
was
donnegan
to
him
and
then
there
was
a
tremor
of
fear
would
the
three
suspect
when
they
reached
the
shack
by
the
ford
and
no
donnegan
came
to
them
the
moments
stole
on
then
the
soft
beat
of
a
galloping
horse
in
the
sand
the
horse
stopped
presently
they
saw
joe
rix
and
harry
masters
pass
in
front
of
the
window
and
they
looked
as
though
a
cyclone
had
caught
them
up
juggled
them
a
dizzy
distance
in
the
air
and
then
flung
them
down
carelessly
upon
bruising
rocks
their
hats
were
gone
and
the
clothes
of
burly
harry
masters
were
literally
torn
from
his
back
joe
rix
was
evidently
far
more
terribly
hurt
for
he
leaned
on
the
arm
of
masters
and
they
came
on
together
staggering
they
done
the
business
exclaimed
lord
nick
and
now
curse
them
i
do
theirs
but
the
girl
could
not
speak
a
black
haze
crossed
before
her
eyes
had
donnegan
gone
out
madly
to
fight
the
three
men
in
spite
of
her
warning
the
door
opened
they
stood
in
the
doorway
and
if
they
had
seemed
a
horrible
sight
passing
the
window
they
were
a
deadly
picture
at
close
range
and
opposite
them
stood
lord
nick
in
spite
of
their
wounds
there
was
murder
in
his
face
and
his
revolver
was
out
you
met
him
you
met
donnegan
he
asked
angrily
masters
literally
carried
joe
rix
to
a
chair
and
placed
him
in
it
he
had
been
shot
through
both
shoulders
and
though
tight
bandages
had
stanched
the
wound
he
was
still
in
agony
then
masters
raised
his
head
we
met
him
he
said
what
happened
but
masters
in
spite
of
the
naked
gun
in
the
hand
of
lord
nick
was
looking
straight
at
nelly
lebrun
we
fought
him
then
say
your
prayers
masters
say
prayers
for
the
pedlar
you
fool
said
masters
bitterly
dead
and
donnegan
still
living
there
was
a
faint
cry
from
nelly
lebrun
she
sank
into
her
chair
again
we
been
said
masters
still
looking
at
the
girl
i
was
going
down
the
gulch
the
way
we
planned
i
come
to
the
narrow
place
where
the
cliffs
almost
touch
and
right
off
the
wall
above
me
drops
a
wildcat
i
thought
it
was
a
cat
at
first
and
then
i
found
it
was
donnegan
the
way
he
hit
me
from
above
knocked
me
off
the
horse
then
we
hit
the
ground
i
started
for
my
gun
he
got
it
out
of
my
hand
i
pulled
my
knife
he
got
that
away
too
his
fingers
work
with
steel
springs
and
act
like
a
cat
claws
then
we
fought
barehanded
he
did
say
a
word
but
kept
snarling
in
his
throat
always
like
a
cat
and
his
face
was
devilish
made
me
sick
inside
pretty
soon
he
dived
under
my
arms
got
me
up
in
the
air
i
came
down
on
my
head
of
course
i
went
out
cold
when
i
came
to
there
was
still
a
mist
in
front
of
my
eyes
and
this
lump
on
the
back
of
my
head
he
figured
that
my
head
was
cracked
and
that
i
was
dead
that
the
only
reason
he
left
me
later
i
climbed
on
my
hoss
and
fed
him
the
spur
but
i
was
too
late
i
took
the
straight
cut
for
the
ford
and
when
i
got
there
i
found
that
donnegan
had
been
there
before
me
joe
rix
was
lyin
on
the
floor
when
he
got
to
the
shack
donnegan
was
waitin
for
him
they
went
for
their
guns
and
donnegan
beat
him
to
it
the
hound
did
shoot
to
kill
he
plugged
him
through
both
shoulders
and
left
him
lyin
helpless
but
i
got
a
couple
of
bandages
on
him
and
saved
him
then
we
cut
back
for
home
and
crossed
the
marsh
and
there
we
found
the
pedlar
too
late
to
help
him
maybe
donnegan
knew
that
the
pedlar
was
something
of
a
flash
with
a
gun
himself
and
he
did
take
any
chances
he
met
him
face
to
face
the
same
way
he
met
joe
rix
and
killed
him
shot
him
clean
between
the
eyes
think
of
shooting
for
the
head
with
a
snap
shot
that
what
he
done
and
joe
did
have
time
to
think
twice
after
that
slug
hit
him
his
gun
was
even
fired
he
was
beat
so
bad
on
the
draw
so
joe
and
me
come
back
home
and
we
come
full
of
questions
let
me
tell
you
something
muttered
lord
nick
putting
up
the
weapon
which
he
had
kept
exposed
during
all
of
the
recital
you
got
what
was
coming
to
you
if
donnegan
had
cleaned
up
on
you
you
have
had
to
talk
turkey
with
me
understand
wait
a
minute
protested
harry
masters
and
joe
rix
almost
too
far
gone
for
speech
set
his
teeth
over
a
groan
and
cast
a
look
of
hatred
at
the
girl
wait
a
minute
chief
there
one
thing
we
all
got
to
get
straight
somebody
had
tipped
off
donnegan
about
our
whole
plan
was
it
the
pedlar
or
rix
or
me
i
guess
good
sense
tell
a
man
that
it
was
none
of
us
eh
then
who
was
it
the
only
other
person
that
knew
about
the
plan
nell
nell
the
crooked
witch
and
it
her
that
murdered
the
pedlar
curse
her
he
thrust
out
his
bulky
arm
as
he
spoke
her
that
lied
her
way
into
our
confidence
with
a
lot
of
talk
about
you
nick
then
what
did
she
do
she
goes
runnin
to
the
gent
that
she
said
she
hated
do
you
see
her
play
she
makes
fools
of
us
she
makes
a
fool
out
of
you
she
dared
not
meet
the
glance
of
lord
nick
even
now
she
might
have
acted
out
her
part
and
filled
in
with
lies
but
she
was
totally
unnerved
get
rix
to
bed
was
all
he
said
and
he
did
not
even
glance
at
nelly
lebrun
masters
glowered
at
him
and
then
silently
obeyed
lifting
joe
as
a
helpless
bulk
for
the
fat
man
was
nearly
fainting
with
pain
not
until
they
had
gone
and
he
had
closed
the
door
after
them
and
upon
the
murmurs
of
the
servants
in
the
hall
did
lord
nick
turn
to
nelly
is
it
true
he
asked
shortly
between
relief
and
terror
her
mind
was
whirling
is
what
true
you
have
even
sense
enough
to
lie
nell
eh
it
all
true
then
and
last
night
after
you
wormed
it
out
of
joe
you
went
to
donnegan
she
could
only
stare
miserably
at
him
and
that
was
why
you
pushed
me
away
when
i
kissed
you
a
little
while
ago
once
more
she
was
dumb
but
she
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
not
for
herself
but
for
donnegan
nell
i
told
you
i
never
let
another
man
come
between
us
again
i
meant
it
i
know
you
treacherous
now
but
that
does
keep
me
from
wanting
you
it
donnegan
again
donnegan
still
nell
you
killed
him
as
sure
as
if
your
own
finger
pulled
the
trigger
when
i
shoot
him
he
a
dead
one
and
you
done
it
if
words
would
only
come
but
her
throat
was
stiff
and
cold
and
aching
she
could
not
speak
you
done
more
than
kill
him
said
lord
nick
you
put
a
curse
on
me
as
well
and
afterward
i
going
to
even
up
with
you
you
hear
me
nell
when
i
shoot
donnegan
i
doing
a
thing
worse
than
if
he
was
a
girl
or
a
baby
you
ca
understand
that
i
do
want
you
to
know
but
some
time
when
you
happy
again
and
you
through
grieving
for
donnegan
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
make
your
heart
black
for
the
rest
of
your
life
still
words
would
not
come
she
strove
to
cling
to
him
and
stop
him
but
he
cast
her
away
with
a
single
gesture
and
strode
out
the
door
there
was
no
crowd
to
block
the
hill
at
this
second
meeting
of
donnegan
and
lord
nick
there
was
a
blank
stretch
of
brown
hillside
with
the
wind
whispering
stealthily
through
the
dead
grass
when
lord
nick
thrust
open
the
door
of
donnegan
shack
and
entered
the
little
man
had
just
finished
shaving
and
was
getting
back
into
his
coat
while
george
carried
out
the
basin
of
water
and
donnegan
as
he
buttoned
the
coat
was
nodding
slightly
to
the
rhythm
of
a
song
which
came
from
the
cabin
of
the
colonel
near
by
it
was
a
clear
high
music
and
though
the
voice
was
light
it
carried
the
sound
far
donnegan
looked
up
to
lord
nick
but
still
he
kept
the
beat
of
the
music
he
seemed
even
more
fragile
this
morning
than
ever
before
yet
lord
nick
was
fresh
from
the
sight
of
the
torn
bodies
of
the
two
fighting
men
whom
this
fellow
had
struck
and
left
for
dead
or
dying
as
he
thought
dismiss
your
servant
said
lord
nick
george
you
may
go
out
and
keep
him
out
do
come
back
until
i
call
for
you
big
george
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
and
the
outside
door
was
closed
yet
even
with
all
the
doors
closed
the
singing
of
lou
macon
kept
running
through
the
cabin
in
a
sweet
and
continuous
thread
what
made
the
ball
so
fine
robin
adair
what
made
the
assembly
shine
robin
adair
and
no
matter
what
lord
nick
could
say
it
seemed
that
with
half
his
mind
donnegan
was
listening
to
the
song
of
the
girl
first
said
the
big
man
i
broken
my
word
donnegan
waved
his
hand
and
dismissed
the
charge
he
pointed
to
a
chair
but
lord
nick
paid
no
heed
i
broken
my
word
he
went
on
i
promised
that
i
give
you
a
clear
road
to
win
over
nelly
lebrun
i
gave
you
the
road
and
you
won
her
but
now
i
taking
her
back
ah
henry
said
donnegan
and
a
flash
of
eagerness
came
in
his
eyes
you
a
thousand
times
welcome
to
her
lord
nick
quivered
do
you
mean
it
henry
do
you
see
that
i
was
only
playing
for
a
purpose
all
the
time
and
if
you
opened
the
eyes
of
nelly
to
the
fact
that
you
truly
love
her
and
i
been
only
acting
out
of
a
heartless
sham
why
glad
of
it
i
rejoice
henry
i
swear
i
do
he
came
forward
smiling
and
held
out
his
hand
lord
nick
struck
it
down
and
donnegan
shrank
back
holding
his
wrist
tight
in
the
fingers
of
his
other
hand
is
it
possible
murmured
henry
reardon
is
it
possible
that
she
loves
a
man
who
despises
her
not
that
if
any
other
man
said
this
to
me
i
call
for
an
explanation
of
his
meaning
henry
no
no
i
honor
and
respect
her
i
tell
you
by
heaven
nick
she
has
a
thread
of
pure
generous
gold
in
her
nature
ah
she
has
saved
my
life
no
longer
ago
than
this
morning
it
perfect
said
lord
nick
and
he
writhed
under
a
torment
i
am
discarded
for
the
sake
of
a
man
who
despises
her
donnegan
frowning
with
thought
watched
his
older
brother
and
still
the
thin
singing
entered
the
room
that
matchless
old
melody
of
robin
adair
the
day
shall
never
come
when
that
song
does
not
go
straight
from
heart
to
heart
but
because
donnegan
still
listened
to
it
lord
nick
felt
that
he
was
contemptuously
received
and
a
fresh
spur
was
driven
into
his
tender
pride
donnegan
he
said
sharply
donnegan
raised
his
hand
slowly
do
you
call
me
by
that
name
aye
you
ceased
to
be
a
brother
there
no
blood
tie
between
us
now
as
i
warned
you
before
donnegan
very
white
moved
back
toward
the
wall
and
rested
his
shoulders
lightly
against
it
as
though
he
needed
the
support
he
made
no
answer
i
warned
you
not
to
cross
me
again
exclaimed
lord
nick
i
have
not
donnegan
you
murdered
my
men
murder
i
met
them
fairly
not
murder
henry
leave
out
that
name
i
say
if
you
wish
said
donnegan
very
faintly
the
sight
of
his
resistlessness
seemed
to
madden
lord
nick
he
made
one
of
his
huge
strides
and
came
to
the
center
of
the
room
and
dominated
all
that
was
in
it
including
his
brother
you
murdered
my
men
repeated
lord
nick
you
turned
my
girl
against
me
with
your
lying
and
turned
her
into
a
spy
you
made
her
set
the
trap
and
then
you
saw
that
it
was
worked
you
showed
her
how
she
could
wind
me
around
her
finger
again
will
you
let
me
speak
aye
but
be
short
i
swear
to
you
henry
that
i
never
influenced
her
to
act
against
you
except
to
win
her
away
for
just
one
little
time
and
she
will
return
to
you
again
it
is
only
a
fancy
that
makes
her
interested
in
me
look
at
us
how
could
any
woman
in
her
senses
prefer
me
are
you
done
no
no
i
have
more
to
say
i
have
a
thousand
things
i
shall
not
hear
them
henry
there
is
a
black
devil
in
your
face
beware
of
it
who
put
it
there
it
was
not
i
what
power
then
something
over
which
i
have
no
control
are
you
trying
to
mystify
me
listen
and
as
donnegan
raised
his
hand
the
singing
poured
clear
and
small
into
the
room
that
is
the
power
said
donnegan
you
talking
gibberish
exclaimed
the
other
pettishly
i
suppose
i
should
expect
you
to
understand
on
the
other
hand
what
i
have
to
say
is
short
and
to
the
point
a
child
could
comprehend
it
you
stolen
the
girl
i
tried
to
let
her
go
i
ca
i
have
to
have
her
willing
or
unwilling
she
has
to
belong
to
me
donnegan
if
you
wish
i
shall
promise
that
i
shall
never
see
her
again
or
speak
to
her
you
fool
wo
she
find
you
out
do
you
think
i
could
trust
you
only
in
one
place
underground
donnegan
had
clasped
his
hands
upon
his
breast
and
his
eyes
were
wide
what
is
it
you
mean
henry
i
trust
you
dead
henry
that
name
means
nothing
to
me
i
forgotten
it
the
worlds
has
forgotten
it
henry
i
implore
you
to
keep
cool
to
give
me
five
minutes
for
talk
no
not
one
i
know
your
cunning
tongue
for
the
sake
of
the
days
when
you
loved
me
my
brother
for
the
sake
of
the
days
when
you
used
to
wheel
my
chair
and
be
kind
to
me
you
wasting
your
time
you
torturing
us
both
for
nothing
donnegan
my
will
is
a
rock
it
wo
change
and
drawing
closer
his
right
hand
gripped
his
gun
and
the
trembling
passion
of
the
gunfighter
set
him
shuddering
you
armed
garry
go
for
your
gun
no
no
then
i
give
you
cause
to
fight
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
back
his
massive
arm
and
with
his
open
hand
smote
donnegan
heavily
across
the
face
the
weight
of
that
blow
crushed
the
little
man
against
the
wall
your
gun
cried
lord
nick
swaying
from
side
to
side
as
the
passion
choked
him
donnegan
fell
upon
his
knees
and
raised
his
arms
god
have
mercy
on
me
and
on
yourself
at
that
the
blackness
cleared
slowly
on
the
face
of
the
big
man
he
thrust
his
revolver
into
the
holster
this
time
he
said
there
no
death
but
sooner
or
later
we
meet
donnegan
and
then
i
swear
by
all
that
lives
i
shoot
you
down
without
mercy
like
a
mad
dog
you
robbed
me
you
hounded
me
you
killed
my
men
you
taken
the
heart
of
the
woman
i
love
and
now
nothing
can
save
you
from
the
end
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
room
and
donnegan
remained
kneeling
holding
a
stained
handkerchief
to
his
face
all
at
once
his
strength
seemed
to
desert
him
like
a
tree
chopped
at
the
root
and
he
wilted
down
against
the
wall
with
closed
eyes
but
the
music
still
came
out
of
the
throat
and
the
heart
of
lou
and
it
entered
the
room
and
came
into
the
ears
of
donnegan
he
became
aware
that
there
was
a
strength
beyond
himself
which
had
sustained
him
and
then
he
knew
it
had
been
the
singing
of
lou
from
first
to
last
which
had
kept
the
murder
out
of
his
own
heart
and
restrained
the
hand
of
lord
nick
perhaps
of
all
donnegan
life
this
was
the
first
moment
of
true
humility
one
thing
was
now
clear
he
must
not
remain
in
the
corner
unless
he
was
prepared
for
lord
nick
again
and
in
a
third
meeting
guns
must
be
drawn
from
that
greater
sin
he
shrank
and
prepared
to
leave
his
order
to
george
made
the
big
man
eyes
widen
but
george
had
long
since
passed
the
point
where
he
cared
to
question
the
decision
of
his
master
he
began
to
build
the
packs
as
for
donnegan
he
could
see
that
there
was
little
to
be
won
by
remaining
that
would
save
landis
to
lou
macon
to
be
sure
but
after
all
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
it
were
not
better
to
let
the
big
fellow
go
back
to
his
own
kind
lebrun
and
the
rest
for
if
it
needed
compulsion
to
keep
him
with
lou
now
might
it
not
be
the
same
story
hereafter
indeed
donnegan
began
to
feel
that
all
his
labor
in
the
corner
had
been
running
on
a
treadmill
it
had
all
been
grouped
about
the
main
purpose
which
was
to
keep
landis
with
the
girl
to
do
that
now
he
must
be
prepared
to
face
nick
again
and
to
face
nick
meant
the
bringing
of
the
guilt
of
fratricide
upon
the
head
of
one
of
them
there
only
remained
flight
he
saw
at
last
that
he
had
been
fighting
blindly
from
the
first
he
had
won
a
girl
whom
he
did
not
love
though
doubtless
her
liking
was
only
the
most
fickle
fancy
and
she
for
whom
he
would
have
died
he
had
taught
to
hate
him
it
was
a
grim
summing
up
donnegan
walked
the
room
whistling
softly
to
himself
as
he
checked
up
his
accounts
one
thing
at
least
he
had
done
he
had
taken
the
joy
out
of
his
life
forever
and
here
answering
a
rap
at
the
door
he
opened
it
upon
lou
macon
she
wore
a
dress
of
some
very
soft
material
it
was
a
pale
blue
faded
no
doubt
but
the
color
blended
exquisitely
with
her
hair
and
with
the
flush
of
her
face
it
came
to
donnegan
that
it
was
an
unnecessary
cruelty
of
chance
that
made
him
see
the
girl
lovelier
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
before
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
surrendering
the
last
shadow
of
a
claim
upon
her
and
it
hurt
him
also
to
see
the
freshness
of
her
face
the
clear
eyes
and
to
hear
her
smooth
untroubled
voice
she
had
lived
untouched
by
anything
save
the
sunshine
in
the
corner
her
glance
flicked
across
his
face
and
then
fluttered
down
and
her
color
increased
guiltily
i
have
come
to
ask
you
a
favor
she
said
step
in
said
donnegan
recovering
his
poise
at
length
at
this
she
looked
past
him
and
her
eyes
widened
a
little
there
was
an
imperceptible
shrug
of
her
shoulders
as
though
the
very
thought
of
entering
this
cabin
horrified
her
and
donnegan
had
to
bear
that
look
as
well
i
stay
here
i
have
much
to
say
it
a
small
thing
large
or
small
said
donnegan
eagerly
tell
me
my
father
has
asked
me
to
take
a
letter
for
him
down
to
the
town
and
mail
it
i
i
understand
that
it
would
be
dangerous
for
me
to
go
alone
will
you
walk
with
me
and
donnegan
turned
cold
go
down
into
the
corner
where
by
five
chances
out
of
ten
he
must
meet
his
brother
in
the
street
i
can
do
better
still
he
said
smiling
i
have
george
take
the
letter
down
for
you
thank
you
but
you
see
father
would
not
trust
it
to
anyone
save
me
i
asked
him
he
was
very
firm
about
it
tush
i
would
trust
george
with
my
life
yes
yes
it
is
not
what
i
wish
but
my
father
rarely
changes
his
mind
perspiration
beaded
the
forehead
of
donnegan
was
there
no
way
to
evade
this
easy
request
you
see
he
faltered
i
should
be
glad
to
go
she
raised
her
eyes
slowly
but
i
am
terribly
busy
this
morning
she
did
not
answer
but
half
of
her
color
left
her
face
upon
my
word
of
honor
there
is
no
danger
to
a
woman
in
the
town
but
some
of
the
ruffians
of
lord
nick
if
they
dared
to
even
raise
their
voices
at
you
they
would
hear
from
him
in
a
manner
that
they
would
never
forget
then
you
do
wish
to
go
she
was
very
pale
now
and
to
donnegan
it
was
more
terrible
than
the
gun
in
the
hand
of
lord
nick
even
if
she
thought
he
was
slighting
her
why
should
she
take
it
so
mortally
to
heart
for
donnegan
who
saw
all
things
was
blind
to
read
the
face
of
this
girl
it
does
really
matter
she
murmured
and
turned
away
a
gentle
motion
but
it
wrenched
the
heart
of
donnegan
he
was
instantly
before
her
wait
here
a
moment
i
be
ready
to
go
down
immediately
no
i
ca
take
you
from
your
work
what
work
did
she
assign
to
him
in
her
imagination
endless
planning
of
deviltry
no
doubt
i
shall
go
with
you
said
donnegan
at
first
i
did
dream
it
could
be
so
important
let
me
get
my
hat
he
left
her
and
leaped
back
into
the
cabin
i
am
going
down
into
the
corner
for
a
moment
he
said
over
his
shoulder
to
george
as
he
took
his
belt
down
from
the
wall
the
big
man
strode
to
the
wall
and
took
his
hat
from
a
nail
i
shall
not
need
you
george
but
george
merely
grinned
and
his
big
teeth
flashed
at
the
master
and
in
the
second
place
he
took
up
a
gun
from
the
drawer
and
offered
it
to
donnegan
the
gun
in
that
holster
ai
loaded
he
said
donnegan
considered
him
soberly
i
know
it
there
be
no
need
for
a
loaded
gun
but
once
more
george
grinned
all
at
once
donnegan
turned
pale
you
dog
he
whispered
did
you
listen
at
the
door
when
nick
was
here
me
murmured
george
no
i
just
been
thinking
and
so
it
was
that
while
donnegan
went
down
the
hill
with
lou
macon
carrying
an
revolver
george
followed
at
a
distance
of
a
few
paces
and
he
carried
a
loaded
weapon
unknown
to
donnegan
it
was
the
dull
time
of
the
day
in
the
corner
there
were
very
few
people
in
the
single
street
and
though
most
of
them
turned
to
look
at
the
little
man
and
the
girl
who
walked
beside
him
not
one
of
them
either
smiled
or
whispered
you
see
said
donnegan
you
would
have
been
perfectly
safe
even
from
lord
nick
ruffians
that
was
one
of
his
men
we
passed
back
there
yes
i
safe
with
you
said
the
girl
and
when
she
looked
up
to
him
the
blood
of
donnegan
turned
to
fire
out
of
a
shop
door
before
them
came
a
girl
with
a
parcel
under
her
arm
she
wore
a
gay
outfit
jaunty
and
she
walked
with
a
lilt
toward
them
it
was
nelly
lebrun
and
as
she
passed
them
donnegan
lifted
his
hat
ceremoniously
high
she
nodded
to
him
with
a
smile
but
the
smile
aimed
wan
and
small
in
an
instant
there
was
a
quick
widening
and
then
a
narrowing
of
her
eyes
and
donnegan
knew
that
she
had
judged
lou
macon
as
only
one
girl
can
judge
another
who
is
lovelier
he
glanced
at
lou
to
see
if
she
had
noticed
and
he
saw
her
raise
her
head
and
go
on
with
her
glance
proudly
straight
before
her
but
her
face
was
very
pale
and
donnegan
knew
that
she
had
guessed
everything
that
was
true
and
far
more
than
the
truth
her
tone
at
the
door
of
the
post
office
was
ice
i
think
you
are
right
donnegan
there
no
danger
and
if
you
have
anything
else
to
do
i
can
get
back
home
easily
enough
i
wait
for
you
murmured
donnegan
sadly
and
he
stood
as
the
door
of
the
little
building
with
bowed
head
and
then
a
murmur
came
down
the
street
how
small
it
was
and
how
sinister
it
consisted
of
exclamations
begun
and
then
broken
sharply
off
a
swirl
of
people
divided
as
a
cloud
of
dust
divides
before
a
blast
of
wind
and
through
them
came
the
gigantic
figure
of
lord
nick
on
he
came
a
gorgeous
figure
a
veritable
king
of
men
he
carried
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
his
red
hair
flamed
and
he
walked
with
great
strides
donnegan
glanced
behind
him
the
way
was
clear
if
he
turned
lord
nick
would
not
pursue
him
he
knew
but
to
flee
even
from
his
brother
was
more
than
he
could
do
for
the
woman
he
loved
would
know
of
it
and
could
never
understand
he
touched
the
holster
that
held
his
empty
gun
and
waited
an
eternity
between
every
step
of
lord
nick
others
seemed
to
have
sensed
the
meaning
of
this
silent
scene
people
seemed
to
stand
frozen
in
the
midst
of
gestures
or
was
that
because
donnegan
own
thoughts
were
traveling
at
such
lightning
speed
that
the
rest
of
the
world
seemed
standing
still
what
kept
lou
macon
if
she
were
with
him
not
even
lord
nick
in
his
madness
would
force
on
a
gunplay
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
no
doubt
lord
nick
was
suddenly
close
he
had
paused
his
voice
rang
over
the
street
and
struck
upon
donnegan
ear
as
sounds
come
under
water
donnegan
aye
called
donnegan
softly
it
the
time
aye
said
donnegan
then
a
huge
body
leaped
before
him
it
was
big
george
and
as
he
sprang
his
gun
went
up
with
his
hand
in
a
line
of
light
the
two
reports
came
close
together
as
finger
taps
on
a
table
and
big
george
completing
his
spring
lurched
face
downward
into
the
sand
dead
not
yet
all
his
faith
and
selflessness
were
nerving
the
big
man
and
donnegan
stood
behind
him
unarmed
he
reared
himself
upon
his
knees
an
imposing
bulk
even
then
and
fired
again
but
his
hand
was
trembling
and
the
bullet
shattered
a
sign
above
the
head
of
lord
nick
he
in
his
turn
it
seemed
to
donnegan
that
the
motion
was
slow
twitched
up
the
muzzle
of
his
weapon
and
fired
once
more
from
his
hip
and
big
george
lurched
back
on
the
sand
with
his
face
upturned
to
donnegan
he
would
have
spoken
but
a
burst
of
blood
choked
him
yet
his
eyes
fixed
and
glazed
he
mustered
his
last
strength
and
offered
his
revolver
to
donnegan
but
donnegan
let
the
hand
fall
limp
to
the
ground
there
were
voices
about
him
steps
running
but
all
that
he
clearly
saw
was
lord
nick
with
his
feet
braced
and
his
head
high
donnegan
your
gun
aye
said
donnegan
take
it
then
but
in
the
crisis
automatically
donnegan
flipped
his
useless
revolver
out
of
its
holster
and
into
his
hand
at
the
same
instant
the
gun
from
nick
hand
seemed
to
blaze
in
his
eyes
he
was
struck
a
crushing
blow
in
his
chest
he
sank
upon
his
knees
another
blow
struck
his
head
and
donnegan
collapsed
on
the
body
of
big
george
an
ancient
drunkard
in
the
second
story
of
one
of
the
stores
across
the
street
had
roused
himself
at
the
sound
of
the
shots
and
now
he
dragged
himself
to
the
window
and
began
to
scream
murder
murder
over
and
over
and
even
the
corner
shuddered
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
lord
nick
his
revolver
still
in
his
hand
stalked
through
the
film
of
people
who
now
swirled
about
him
eager
to
see
the
dead
there
was
no
call
for
the
law
to
make
its
appearance
and
the
representatives
of
the
law
were
wisely
dilatory
in
the
corner
he
stood
over
the
two
motionless
figures
with
a
stony
face
you
saw
it
boys
he
said
you
know
what
i
borne
from
this
fellow
the
big
man
pulled
his
gun
first
on
me
i
shot
in
as
for
the
other
it
was
a
square
fight
square
fight
someone
answered
you
both
went
for
your
irons
at
the
same
time
pretty
work
nick
it
was
a
solid
phalanx
of
men
which
had
collected
around
the
moveless
bodies
as
swiftly
as
mercury
sinks
through
water
yet
none
of
them
touched
either
donnegan
or
george
and
then
the
solid
group
dissolved
at
one
side
it
was
the
moan
of
a
woman
which
had
scattered
it
and
a
girl
slipped
through
them
she
glanced
once
in
horror
at
the
mute
faces
of
the
men
and
then
there
was
a
wail
as
she
threw
herself
on
the
body
of
donnegan
somewhere
she
found
the
strength
of
a
man
to
lift
him
and
place
him
face
upward
on
the
sand
the
gun
trailing
limply
in
his
hand
and
then
she
lay
half
crouched
over
him
her
face
pressed
to
his
heart
listening
listening
for
the
stir
of
life
shootings
were
common
in
the
corner
the
daily
mortality
ran
high
but
there
had
never
been
aftermaths
like
this
one
men
looked
at
one
another
and
then
at
lord
nick
a
bright
spot
of
color
had
come
in
his
cheeks
but
his
face
was
as
hard
as
ever
get
her
away
from
him
someone
murmured
and
then
another
man
cried
out
stooped
wrenched
the
gun
from
the
limp
hand
of
donnegan
and
opened
the
cylinder
he
spun
it
daylight
was
glittering
through
the
empty
cylinder
at
this
the
man
stiffened
and
with
a
low
bow
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
he
presented
the
weapon
butt
first
to
lord
nick
here
something
the
sheriff
will
want
to
see
he
said
but
maybe
you
be
interested
too
but
lord
nick
with
the
gun
in
his
hand
stared
at
it
dumbly
turned
the
empty
cylinder
and
the
full
horror
crept
slowly
on
his
mind
he
had
not
killed
his
brother
he
had
murdered
him
as
his
eyes
cleared
he
caught
the
glitter
of
the
eyes
which
surrounded
him
and
then
lou
macon
was
on
her
knees
with
her
hands
clasped
at
her
breast
and
her
face
glorious
help
she
was
crying
help
me
he
not
dead
but
he
dying
unless
you
help
me
then
lord
nick
cast
away
his
own
revolver
and
the
empty
gun
of
donnegan
they
heard
him
shout
garry
and
saw
him
stride
forward
instantly
men
pressed
between
men
who
meant
business
it
was
a
cordon
he
would
have
to
fight
his
way
through
but
he
dissolved
it
with
a
word
you
fools
he
my
brother
and
then
he
was
on
his
knees
opposite
lou
macon
you
she
had
stammered
in
horror
his
brother
girl
and
ten
minutes
later
when
the
bandages
had
been
wound
there
was
a
strange
sight
of
lord
nick
striding
up
the
street
with
his
victim
in
his
arms
how
lightly
he
walked
and
he
was
talking
to
the
calm
pale
face
which
rested
in
the
hollow
of
his
shoulder
he
will
live
he
will
live
lou
macon
was
pleading
as
she
hurried
at
the
side
of
lord
nick
god
willing
he
shall
live
it
was
three
hours
before
donnegan
opened
his
eyes
it
was
three
days
before
he
recovered
his
senses
and
looking
aside
toward
the
door
he
saw
a
brilliant
shaft
of
sunlight
falling
into
the
room
in
the
midst
of
it
sat
lou
macon
she
had
fallen
asleep
in
her
great
weariness
now
that
the
crisis
was
over
behind
her
standing
his
great
arms
folded
stood
the
indomitable
figure
of
lord
nick
donnegan
saw
and
wondered
greatly
then
he
closed
his
eyes
dreamily
hush
said
donnegan
to
himself
as
if
afraid
that
what
he
saw
was
all
a
dream
i
in
heaven
or
if
i
not
it
still
mighty
good
to
be
alive
