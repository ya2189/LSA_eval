bedford
meets
cavor
at
lympne
as
i
sit
down
to
write
here
amidst
the
shadows
of
under
the
blue
sky
of
southern
italy
it
comes
to
me
with
a
certain
quality
of
astonishment
that
my
participation
in
these
amazing
adventures
of
cavor
was
after
all
the
outcome
of
the
purest
accident
it
might
have
been
any
one
i
fell
into
these
things
at
a
time
when
i
thought
myself
removed
from
the
slightest
possibility
of
disturbing
experiences
i
had
gone
to
lympne
because
i
had
imagined
it
the
most
uneventful
place
in
the
world
at
any
rate
said
i
shall
find
peace
and
a
chance
to
work
and
this
book
is
the
sequel
so
utterly
at
variance
is
destiny
with
all
the
little
plans
of
men
i
may
perhaps
mention
here
that
very
recently
i
had
come
an
ugly
cropper
in
certain
business
enterprises
sitting
now
surrounded
by
all
the
circumstances
of
wealth
there
is
a
luxury
in
admitting
my
extremity
i
can
admit
even
that
to
a
certain
extent
my
disasters
were
conceivably
of
my
own
making
it
may
be
there
are
directions
in
which
i
have
some
capacity
but
the
conduct
of
business
operations
is
not
among
these
but
in
those
days
i
was
young
and
my
youth
among
other
objectionable
forms
took
that
of
a
pride
in
my
capacity
for
affairs
i
am
young
still
in
years
but
the
things
that
have
happened
to
me
have
rubbed
something
of
the
youth
from
my
mind
whether
they
have
brought
any
wisdom
to
light
below
it
is
a
more
doubtful
matter
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
go
into
the
details
of
the
speculations
that
landed
me
at
lympne
in
kent
nowadays
even
about
business
transactions
there
is
a
strong
spice
of
adventure
i
took
risks
in
these
things
there
is
invariably
a
certain
amount
of
give
and
take
and
it
fell
to
me
finally
to
do
the
giving
reluctantly
enough
even
when
i
had
got
out
of
everything
one
cantankerous
creditor
saw
fit
to
be
malignant
perhaps
you
have
met
that
flaming
sense
of
outraged
virtue
or
perhaps
you
have
only
felt
it
he
ran
me
hard
it
seemed
to
me
at
last
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
write
a
play
unless
i
wanted
to
drudge
for
my
living
as
a
clerk
i
have
a
certain
imagination
and
luxurious
tastes
and
i
meant
to
make
a
vigorous
fight
for
it
before
that
fate
overtook
me
in
addition
to
my
belief
in
my
powers
as
a
business
man
i
had
always
in
those
days
had
an
idea
that
i
was
equal
to
writing
a
very
good
play
it
is
not
i
believe
a
very
uncommon
persuasion
i
knew
there
is
nothing
a
man
can
do
outside
legitimate
business
transactions
that
has
such
opulent
possibilities
and
very
probably
that
biased
my
opinion
i
had
indeed
got
into
the
habit
of
regarding
this
unwritten
drama
as
a
convenient
little
reserve
put
by
for
a
rainy
day
that
rainy
day
had
come
and
i
set
to
work
i
soon
discovered
that
writing
a
play
was
a
longer
business
than
i
had
supposed
at
first
i
had
reckoned
ten
days
for
it
and
it
was
to
have
a
while
it
was
in
hand
that
i
came
to
lympne
i
reckoned
myself
lucky
in
getting
that
little
bungalow
i
got
it
on
a
three
agreement
i
put
in
a
few
sticks
of
furniture
and
while
the
play
was
in
hand
i
did
my
own
cooking
my
cooking
would
have
shocked
mrs
bond
and
yet
you
know
it
had
flavour
i
had
a
a
for
eggs
and
one
for
potatoes
and
a
for
sausages
and
was
the
simple
apparatus
of
my
comfort
one
can
not
always
be
magnificent
but
simplicity
is
always
a
possible
alternative
for
the
rest
i
laid
in
an
cask
of
beer
on
credit
and
a
trustful
baker
came
each
day
it
was
not
perhaps
in
the
style
of
sybaris
but
i
have
had
worse
times
i
was
a
little
sorry
for
the
baker
who
was
a
very
decent
man
indeed
but
even
for
him
i
hoped
certainly
if
any
one
wants
solitude
the
place
is
lympne
it
is
in
the
clay
part
of
kent
and
my
bungalow
stood
on
the
edge
of
an
old
sea
cliff
and
stared
across
the
flats
of
romney
marsh
at
the
sea
in
very
wet
weather
the
place
is
almost
inaccessible
and
i
have
heard
that
at
times
the
postman
used
to
traverse
the
more
succulent
portions
of
his
route
with
boards
upon
his
feet
i
never
saw
him
doing
so
but
i
can
quite
imagine
it
outside
the
doors
of
the
few
cottages
and
houses
that
make
up
the
present
village
big
birch
besoms
are
stuck
to
wipe
off
the
worst
of
the
clay
which
will
give
some
idea
of
the
texture
of
the
district
i
doubt
if
the
place
would
be
there
at
all
if
it
were
not
a
fading
memory
of
things
gone
for
ever
it
was
the
big
port
of
england
in
roman
times
portus
lemanis
and
now
the
sea
is
four
miles
away
all
down
the
steep
hill
are
boulders
and
masses
of
roman
brickwork
and
from
it
old
watling
street
still
paved
in
places
starts
like
an
arrow
to
the
north
i
used
to
stand
on
the
hill
and
think
of
it
all
the
galleys
and
legions
the
captives
and
officials
the
women
and
traders
the
speculators
like
myself
all
the
swarm
and
tumult
that
came
clanking
in
and
out
of
the
harbour
and
now
just
a
few
lumps
of
rubble
on
a
grassy
slope
and
a
sheep
or
i
and
where
the
port
had
been
were
the
levels
of
the
marsh
sweeping
round
in
a
broad
curve
to
distant
dungeness
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
tree
clumps
and
the
church
towers
of
old
medi√¶val
towns
that
are
following
lemanis
now
towards
extinction
that
outlook
on
the
marsh
was
indeed
one
of
the
finest
views
i
have
ever
seen
i
suppose
dungeness
was
fifteen
miles
away
it
lay
like
a
raft
on
the
sea
and
farther
westward
were
the
hills
by
hastings
under
the
setting
sun
sometimes
they
hung
close
and
clear
sometimes
they
were
faded
and
low
and
often
the
drift
of
the
weather
took
them
clean
out
of
sight
and
all
the
nearer
parts
of
the
marsh
were
laced
and
lit
by
ditches
and
canals
the
window
at
which
i
worked
looked
over
the
skyline
of
this
crest
and
it
was
from
this
window
that
i
first
set
eyes
on
cavor
it
was
just
as
i
was
struggling
with
my
scenario
holding
down
my
mind
to
the
sheer
hard
work
of
it
and
naturally
enough
he
arrested
my
attention
the
sun
had
set
the
sky
was
a
vivid
tranquillity
of
green
and
yellow
and
against
that
he
came
out
oddest
little
figure
he
was
a
short
little
man
with
a
jerky
quality
in
his
motions
he
had
seen
fit
to
clothe
his
extraordinary
mind
in
a
cricket
cap
an
overcoat
and
cycling
knickerbockers
and
stockings
why
he
did
so
i
do
not
know
for
he
never
cycled
and
he
never
played
cricket
it
was
a
fortuitous
concurrence
of
garments
arising
i
know
not
how
he
gesticulated
with
his
hands
and
arms
and
jerked
his
head
about
and
buzzed
he
buzzed
like
something
electric
you
never
heard
such
buzzing
and
ever
and
again
he
cleared
his
throat
with
a
most
extraordinary
noise
there
had
been
rain
and
that
spasmodic
walk
of
his
was
enhanced
by
the
extreme
slipperiness
of
the
footpath
exactly
as
he
came
against
the
sun
he
stopped
pulled
out
a
watch
hesitated
then
with
a
sort
of
convulsive
gesture
he
turned
and
retreated
with
every
manifestation
of
haste
no
longer
gesticulating
but
going
with
ample
strides
that
showed
the
relatively
large
size
of
his
were
i
remember
grotesquely
exaggerated
in
size
by
adhesive
the
best
possible
advantage
this
occurred
on
the
first
day
of
my
sojourn
when
my
energy
was
at
its
height
and
i
regarded
the
incident
simply
as
an
annoying
waste
of
five
minutes
i
returned
to
my
scenario
but
when
next
evening
the
apparition
was
repeated
with
remarkable
precision
and
again
the
next
evening
and
indeed
every
evening
when
rain
was
not
falling
concentration
upon
the
scenario
became
a
considerable
effort
the
man
i
said
would
think
he
was
learning
to
be
a
marionette
and
for
several
evenings
i
cursed
him
pretty
heartily
then
my
annoyance
gave
way
to
amazement
and
curiosity
why
on
earth
should
a
man
do
this
thing
on
the
fourteenth
evening
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
so
soon
as
he
appeared
i
opened
the
french
window
crossed
the
verandah
and
directed
myself
to
the
point
where
he
invariably
stopped
he
had
his
watch
out
as
i
came
up
to
him
he
had
a
chubby
rubicund
face
with
reddish
brown
i
had
seen
him
only
against
the
light
moment
sir
said
i
as
he
turned
he
stared
moment
he
said
or
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
for
longer
and
it
is
not
asking
too
moment
is
it
trouble
you
to
accompany
me
in
the
least
said
i
placing
myself
beside
him
habits
are
regular
my
time
for
i
presume
is
your
time
for
exercise
is
i
come
here
to
enjoy
the
never
look
at
look
at
it
watched
you
thirteen
nights
and
not
once
have
you
looked
at
the
he
knitted
his
brows
like
one
who
encounters
a
problem
i
enjoy
the
go
along
this
path
through
that
jerked
his
head
over
his
you
never
have
been
all
nonsense
there
a
way
for
let
me
see
ah
i
just
glanced
at
my
watch
saw
that
i
had
already
been
out
just
three
minutes
over
the
precise
decided
there
was
not
time
to
go
round
always
he
looked
at
i
do
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
but
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
about
this
why
do
you
do
it
every
night
you
come
making
a
a
noise
i
imitated
his
buzzing
noise
he
looked
at
me
and
it
was
evident
the
buzzing
awakened
distaste
i
do
he
asked
blessed
had
no
he
stopped
dead
he
regarded
me
gravely
it
be
he
said
i
have
formed
a
habit
it
looks
like
it
it
he
pulled
down
his
lower
lip
between
finger
and
thumb
he
regarded
a
puddle
at
his
feet
mind
is
much
occupied
he
said
you
want
to
know
well
sir
i
can
assure
you
that
not
only
do
i
not
know
why
i
do
these
things
but
i
did
not
even
know
i
did
them
come
to
think
it
is
just
as
you
say
i
never
been
beyond
that
field
and
these
things
annoy
you
for
some
reason
i
was
beginning
to
relent
towards
him
i
said
yourself
writing
a
play
anything
that
needs
he
said
course
and
meditated
his
expression
became
so
eloquent
of
distress
that
i
relented
still
more
after
all
there
is
a
touch
of
aggression
in
demanding
of
a
man
you
know
why
he
hums
on
a
public
footpath
see
he
said
weakly
a
i
recognise
must
stop
not
if
it
puts
you
out
after
all
i
had
no
something
of
a
at
all
sir
he
said
at
all
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
you
i
should
guard
myself
against
these
things
in
future
i
will
could
i
trouble
again
that
noise
like
this
i
said
zuzzoo
but
really
you
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
in
fact
i
know
i
am
getting
absurdly
you
are
quite
justified
justified
indeed
i
am
indebted
to
you
the
thing
shall
end
and
now
sir
i
have
already
brought
you
farther
than
i
should
have
do
hope
my
at
all
sir
not
at
we
regarded
each
other
for
a
moment
i
raised
my
hat
and
wished
him
a
good
evening
he
responded
convulsively
and
so
we
went
our
ways
at
the
stile
i
looked
back
at
his
receding
figure
his
bearing
had
changed
remarkably
he
seemed
limp
shrunken
the
contrast
with
his
former
gesticulating
zuzzoing
self
took
me
in
some
absurd
way
as
pathetic
i
watched
him
out
of
sight
then
wishing
very
heartily
i
had
kept
to
my
own
business
i
returned
to
my
bungalow
and
my
play
the
next
evening
i
saw
nothing
of
him
nor
the
next
but
he
was
very
much
in
my
mind
and
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
as
a
sentimental
comic
character
he
might
serve
a
useful
purpose
in
the
development
of
my
plot
the
third
day
he
called
upon
me
for
a
time
i
was
puzzled
to
think
what
had
brought
him
he
made
indifferent
conversation
in
the
most
formal
way
then
abruptly
he
came
to
business
he
wanted
to
buy
me
out
of
my
bungalow
see
he
said
blame
you
in
the
least
but
destroyed
a
habit
and
it
disorganises
my
day
walked
past
here
for
no
doubt
hummed
made
all
that
impossible
i
suggested
he
might
try
some
other
direction
there
is
no
other
direction
this
is
the
only
one
inquired
and
afternoon
at
come
to
a
dead
my
dear
sir
if
the
thing
is
so
important
to
vital
you
see
an
am
engaged
in
a
scientific
research
i
he
paused
and
seemed
to
think
over
there
he
said
and
pointed
suddenly
dangerously
near
my
eye
house
with
white
chimneys
you
see
just
over
the
trees
and
my
circumstances
are
i
am
on
the
point
of
completing
one
of
the
most
can
assure
you
one
of
most
demonstrations
that
have
ever
been
made
it
requires
constant
thought
constant
mental
ease
and
activity
and
the
afternoon
was
my
brightest
time
with
new
points
of
why
not
come
by
still
would
be
all
different
i
should
be
i
should
think
of
you
at
your
me
of
thinking
of
my
work
no
i
must
have
the
i
meditated
naturally
i
wanted
to
think
the
matter
over
thoroughly
before
anything
decisive
was
said
i
was
generally
ready
enough
for
business
in
those
days
and
selling
always
attracted
me
but
in
the
first
place
it
was
not
my
bungalow
and
even
if
i
sold
it
to
him
at
a
good
price
i
might
get
inconvenienced
in
the
delivery
of
goods
if
the
current
owner
got
wind
of
the
transaction
and
in
the
second
i
was
it
was
clearly
a
business
that
required
delicate
handling
moreover
the
possibility
of
his
being
in
pursuit
of
some
valuable
invention
also
interested
me
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
like
to
know
more
of
this
research
not
with
any
dishonest
intention
but
simply
with
an
idea
that
to
know
what
it
was
would
be
a
relief
from
i
threw
out
feelers
he
was
quite
willing
to
supply
information
indeed
once
he
was
fairly
under
way
the
conversation
became
a
monologue
he
talked
like
a
man
long
pent
up
who
has
had
it
over
with
himself
again
and
again
he
talked
for
nearly
an
hour
and
i
must
confess
i
found
it
a
pretty
stiff
bit
of
listening
but
through
it
all
there
was
the
undertone
of
satisfaction
one
feels
when
one
is
neglecting
work
one
has
set
oneself
during
that
first
interview
i
gathered
very
little
of
the
drift
of
his
work
half
his
words
were
technicalities
entirely
strange
to
me
and
he
illustrated
one
or
two
points
with
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
elementary
mathematics
computing
on
an
envelope
with
a
pencil
in
a
manner
that
made
it
hard
even
to
seem
to
understand
i
said
go
on
nevertheless
i
made
out
enough
to
convince
me
that
he
was
no
mere
crank
playing
at
discoveries
in
spite
of
his
appearance
there
was
a
force
about
him
that
made
that
impossible
whatever
it
was
it
was
a
thing
with
mechanical
possibilities
he
told
me
of
a
he
had
and
of
three
jobbing
he
had
trained
now
from
the
to
the
patent
office
is
clearly
only
one
step
he
invited
me
to
see
those
things
i
accepted
readily
and
took
care
by
a
remark
or
so
to
underline
that
the
proposed
transfer
of
the
bungalow
remained
very
conveniently
in
suspense
at
last
he
rose
to
depart
with
an
apology
for
the
length
of
his
call
talking
over
his
work
was
he
said
a
pleasure
enjoyed
only
too
rarely
it
was
not
often
he
found
such
an
intelligent
listener
as
myself
he
mingled
very
little
with
professional
scientific
men
much
pettiness
he
explained
much
intrigue
and
really
when
one
has
an
novel
fertilising
want
to
be
uncharitable
i
am
a
man
who
believes
in
impulses
i
made
what
was
perhaps
a
rash
proposition
but
you
must
remember
that
i
had
been
alone
in
lympne
for
fourteen
days
and
my
compunction
for
his
ruined
walk
still
hung
about
me
not
said
i
this
your
new
habit
in
the
place
of
the
one
i
spoilt
at
least
until
we
can
settle
about
the
bungalow
what
you
want
is
to
turn
over
your
work
in
your
mind
that
you
have
always
done
during
your
afternoon
walk
unfortunately
get
things
back
as
they
were
but
why
not
come
and
talk
about
your
work
to
me
use
me
as
a
sort
of
wall
against
which
you
may
throw
your
thoughts
and
catch
them
again
certain
i
know
enough
to
steal
your
ideas
i
know
no
scientific
i
stopped
he
was
considering
evidently
the
thing
attracted
him
afraid
i
should
bore
you
he
said
think
too
dull
no
but
interested
me
immensely
this
course
it
be
a
great
help
to
me
nothing
clears
up
ideas
so
much
as
explaining
them
dear
sir
say
no
really
can
you
spare
the
time
is
no
rest
like
change
of
occupation
i
said
with
profound
conviction
the
affair
was
over
on
my
verandah
steps
he
turned
am
already
greatly
indebted
to
you
he
said
i
made
an
interrogative
noise
have
completely
cured
me
of
that
ridiculous
habit
of
humming
he
explained
i
think
i
said
i
was
glad
to
be
of
any
service
to
him
and
he
turned
away
immediately
the
train
of
thought
that
our
conversation
had
suggested
must
have
resumed
its
sway
his
arms
began
to
wave
in
their
former
fashion
the
faint
echo
of
came
back
to
me
on
the
breeze
well
after
all
that
was
not
my
affair
he
came
the
next
day
and
again
the
next
day
after
that
and
delivered
two
lectures
on
physics
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
he
talked
with
an
air
of
being
extremely
lucid
about
the
and
of
force
and
potential
and
things
like
that
and
i
sat
in
my
other
and
said
on
follow
you
to
keep
him
going
it
was
tremendously
difficult
stuff
but
i
do
not
think
he
ever
suspected
how
much
i
did
not
understand
him
there
were
moments
when
i
doubted
whether
i
was
well
employed
but
at
any
rate
i
was
resting
from
that
confounded
play
now
and
then
things
gleamed
on
me
clearly
for
a
space
only
to
vanish
just
when
i
thought
i
had
hold
of
them
sometimes
my
attention
failed
altogether
and
i
would
give
it
up
and
sit
and
stare
at
him
wondering
whether
after
all
it
would
not
be
better
to
use
him
as
a
central
figure
in
a
good
farce
and
let
all
this
other
stuff
slide
and
then
perhaps
i
would
catch
on
again
for
a
bit
at
the
earliest
opportunity
i
went
to
see
his
house
it
was
large
and
carelessly
furnished
there
were
no
servants
other
than
his
three
assistants
and
his
dietary
and
private
life
were
characterised
by
a
philosophical
simplicity
he
was
a
a
vegetarian
and
all
those
logical
disciplinary
things
but
the
sight
of
his
equipment
settled
many
doubts
it
looked
like
business
from
cellar
to
amazing
little
place
to
find
in
an
village
the
rooms
contained
benches
and
apparatus
the
bakehouse
and
scullery
boiler
had
developed
into
respectable
furnaces
dynamos
occupied
the
cellar
and
there
was
a
gasometer
in
the
garden
he
showed
it
to
me
with
all
the
confiding
zest
of
a
man
who
has
been
living
too
much
alone
his
seclusion
was
overflowing
now
in
an
excess
of
confidence
and
i
had
the
good
luck
to
be
the
recipient
the
three
assistants
were
creditable
specimens
of
the
class
of
from
which
they
came
conscientious
if
unintelligent
strong
civil
and
willing
one
spargus
who
did
the
cooking
and
all
the
metal
work
had
been
a
sailor
a
second
gibbs
was
a
joiner
and
the
third
was
an
gardener
and
now
general
assistant
they
were
the
merest
labourers
all
the
intelligent
work
was
done
by
cavor
theirs
was
the
darkest
ignorance
compared
even
with
my
muddled
impression
and
now
as
to
the
nature
of
these
inquiries
here
unhappily
comes
a
grave
difficulty
i
am
no
scientific
expert
and
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
set
forth
in
the
highly
scientific
language
of
cavor
the
aim
to
which
his
experiments
tended
i
am
afraid
i
should
confuse
not
only
the
reader
but
myself
and
almost
certainly
i
should
make
some
blunder
that
would
bring
upon
me
the
mockery
of
every
student
of
mathematical
physics
in
the
country
the
best
thing
i
can
do
therefore
is
i
think
to
give
my
impressions
in
my
own
inexact
language
without
any
attempt
to
wear
a
garment
of
knowledge
to
which
i
have
no
claim
the
object
of
search
was
a
substance
that
should
be
used
some
other
word
i
have
forgotten
but
conveys
the
forms
of
radiant
energy
he
made
me
understand
was
anything
like
light
or
heat
or
those
rontgen
rays
there
was
so
much
talk
about
a
year
or
so
ago
or
the
electric
waves
of
marconi
or
gravitation
all
these
things
he
said
out
from
centres
and
act
on
bodies
at
a
distance
whence
comes
the
term
now
almost
all
substances
are
opaque
to
some
form
or
other
of
radiant
energy
glass
for
example
is
transparent
to
light
but
much
less
so
to
heat
so
that
it
is
useful
as
a
and
alum
is
transparent
to
light
but
blocks
heat
completely
a
solution
of
iodine
in
carbon
bisulphide
on
the
other
hand
completely
blocks
light
but
is
quite
transparent
to
heat
it
will
hide
a
fire
from
you
but
permit
all
its
warmth
to
reach
you
metals
are
not
only
opaque
to
light
and
heat
but
also
to
electrical
energy
which
passes
through
both
iodine
solution
and
glass
almost
as
though
they
were
not
interposed
and
so
on
now
all
known
substances
are
to
gravitation
you
can
use
screens
of
various
sorts
to
cut
off
the
light
or
heat
or
electrical
influence
of
the
sun
or
the
warmth
of
the
earth
from
anything
you
can
screen
things
by
sheets
of
metal
from
rays
but
nothing
will
cut
off
the
gravitational
attraction
of
the
sun
or
the
gravitational
attraction
of
the
earth
yet
why
there
should
be
nothing
is
hard
to
say
cavor
did
not
see
why
such
a
substance
should
not
exist
and
certainly
i
could
not
tell
him
i
had
never
thought
of
such
a
possibility
before
he
showed
me
by
calculations
on
paper
which
lord
kelvin
no
doubt
or
professor
lodge
or
professor
karl
pearson
or
any
of
those
great
scientific
people
might
have
understood
but
which
simply
reduced
me
to
a
hopeless
muddle
that
not
only
was
such
a
substance
possible
but
that
it
must
satisfy
certain
conditions
it
was
an
amazing
piece
of
reasoning
much
as
it
amazed
and
exercised
me
at
the
time
it
would
be
impossible
to
reproduce
it
here
i
said
to
it
all
go
on
suffice
it
for
this
story
that
he
believed
he
might
be
able
to
manufacture
this
possible
substance
opaque
to
gravitation
out
of
a
complicated
alloy
of
metals
and
something
new
element
i
i
believe
which
was
sent
to
him
from
london
in
sealed
stone
jars
doubt
has
been
thrown
upon
this
detail
but
i
am
almost
certain
it
was
he
had
sent
him
in
sealed
stone
jars
it
was
certainly
something
very
gaseous
and
thin
if
only
i
had
taken
notes
but
then
how
was
i
to
foresee
the
necessity
of
taking
notes
any
one
with
the
merest
germ
of
an
imagination
will
understand
the
extraordinary
possibilities
of
such
a
substance
and
will
sympathise
a
little
with
the
emotion
i
felt
as
this
understanding
emerged
from
the
haze
of
abstruse
phrases
in
which
cavor
expressed
himself
comic
relief
in
a
play
indeed
it
was
some
time
before
i
would
believe
that
i
had
interpreted
him
aright
and
i
was
very
careful
not
to
ask
questions
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
gauge
the
profundity
of
misunderstanding
into
which
he
dropped
his
daily
exposition
but
no
one
reading
the
story
of
it
here
will
sympathise
fully
because
from
my
barren
narrative
it
will
be
impossible
to
gather
the
strength
of
my
conviction
that
this
astonishing
substance
was
positively
going
to
be
made
i
do
not
recall
that
i
gave
my
play
an
consecutive
work
at
any
time
after
my
visit
to
his
house
my
imagination
had
other
things
to
do
there
seemed
no
limit
to
the
possibilities
of
the
stuff
whichever
way
i
tried
i
came
on
miracles
and
revolutions
for
example
if
one
wanted
to
lift
a
weight
however
enormous
one
had
only
to
get
a
sheet
of
this
substance
beneath
it
and
one
might
lift
it
with
a
straw
my
first
natural
impulse
was
to
apply
this
principle
to
guns
and
ironclads
and
all
the
material
and
methods
of
war
and
from
that
to
shipping
locomotion
building
every
conceivable
form
of
human
industry
the
chance
that
had
brought
me
into
the
very
of
this
new
was
an
epoch
no
one
of
those
chances
that
come
once
in
a
thousand
years
the
thing
unrolled
it
expanded
and
expanded
among
other
things
i
saw
in
it
my
redemption
as
a
business
man
i
saw
a
parent
company
and
daughter
companies
applications
to
right
of
us
applications
to
left
rings
and
trusts
privileges
and
concessions
spreading
and
spreading
until
one
vast
stupendous
cavorite
company
ran
and
ruled
the
world
and
i
was
in
it
i
took
my
line
straight
away
i
knew
i
was
staking
everything
but
i
jumped
there
and
then
on
absolutely
the
biggest
thing
that
has
ever
been
invented
i
said
and
put
the
accent
on
you
want
to
keep
me
out
of
this
have
to
do
it
with
a
gun
coming
down
to
be
your
fourth
labourer
he
seemed
surprised
at
my
enthusiasm
but
not
a
bit
suspicious
or
hostile
rather
he
was
he
looked
at
me
doubtfully
do
you
really
he
said
your
play
how
about
that
play
vanished
i
cried
dear
sir
you
see
what
got
you
see
what
going
to
do
that
was
merely
a
rhetorical
turn
but
positively
he
at
first
i
could
not
believe
it
he
had
not
had
the
beginning
of
the
inkling
of
an
idea
this
astonishing
little
man
had
been
working
on
purely
theoretical
grounds
the
whole
time
when
he
said
it
was
most
research
the
world
had
ever
seen
he
simply
meant
it
squared
up
so
many
theories
settled
so
much
that
was
in
doubt
he
had
troubled
no
more
about
the
application
of
the
stuff
he
was
going
to
turn
out
than
if
he
had
been
a
machine
that
makes
guns
this
was
a
possible
substance
and
he
was
going
to
make
it
as
the
frenchman
says
beyond
that
he
was
childish
if
he
made
it
it
would
go
down
to
posterity
as
cavorite
or
cavorine
and
he
would
be
made
an
and
his
portrait
given
away
as
a
scientific
worthy
with
and
things
like
that
and
that
was
all
he
saw
he
would
have
dropped
this
bombshell
into
the
world
as
though
he
had
discovered
a
new
species
of
gnat
if
it
had
not
happened
that
i
had
come
along
and
there
it
would
have
lain
and
fizzled
like
one
or
two
other
little
things
these
scientific
people
have
lit
and
dropped
about
us
when
i
realised
this
it
was
i
did
the
talking
and
cavor
who
said
on
i
jumped
up
i
paced
the
room
gesticulating
like
a
boy
of
twenty
i
tried
to
make
him
understand
his
duties
and
responsibilities
in
the
duties
and
responsibilities
in
the
matter
i
assured
him
we
might
make
wealth
enough
to
work
any
sort
of
social
revolution
we
fancied
we
might
own
and
order
the
whole
world
i
told
him
of
companies
and
patents
and
the
case
for
secret
processes
all
these
things
seemed
to
take
him
much
as
his
mathematics
had
taken
me
a
look
of
perplexity
came
into
his
ruddy
little
face
he
stammered
something
about
indifference
to
wealth
but
i
brushed
all
that
aside
he
had
got
to
be
rich
and
it
was
no
good
his
stammering
i
gave
him
to
understand
the
sort
of
man
i
was
and
that
i
had
had
very
considerable
business
experience
i
did
not
tell
him
i
was
an
undischarged
bankrupt
at
the
time
because
that
was
temporary
but
i
think
i
reconciled
my
evident
poverty
with
my
financial
claims
and
quite
insensibly
in
the
way
such
projects
grow
the
understanding
of
a
cavorite
monopoly
grew
up
between
us
he
was
to
make
the
stuff
and
i
was
to
make
the
boom
i
stuck
like
a
leech
to
the
and
exist
for
me
his
idea
was
that
the
profits
i
spoke
of
might
go
to
endow
research
but
that
of
course
was
a
matter
we
had
to
settle
later
all
right
i
shouted
all
the
great
point
as
i
insisted
was
to
get
the
thing
done
is
a
substance
i
cried
home
no
factory
no
fortress
no
ship
can
dare
to
be
universally
applicable
even
than
a
patent
medicine
there
a
solitary
aspect
of
it
not
one
of
its
ten
thousand
possible
uses
that
will
not
make
us
rich
cavor
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
he
said
begin
to
see
extraordinary
how
one
gets
new
points
of
view
by
talking
over
things
as
it
happens
you
have
just
talked
to
the
right
man
suppose
no
one
he
said
absolutely
to
enormous
wealth
of
course
there
is
one
he
paused
i
stood
still
is
just
possible
you
know
that
we
may
not
be
able
to
make
it
after
all
it
may
be
one
of
those
things
that
are
a
theoretical
possibility
but
a
practical
absurdity
or
when
we
make
it
there
may
be
some
little
hitch
tackle
the
hitch
when
it
comes
said
ii
the
first
making
of
cavorite
but
fears
were
groundless
so
far
as
the
actual
making
was
concerned
on
the
of
october
this
incredible
substance
was
made
oddly
enough
it
was
made
at
last
by
accident
when
cavor
least
expected
it
he
had
fused
together
a
number
of
metals
and
certain
other
wish
i
knew
the
particulars
now
he
intended
to
leave
the
mixture
a
week
and
then
allow
it
to
cool
slowly
unless
he
had
miscalculated
the
last
stage
in
the
combination
would
occur
when
the
stuff
sank
to
a
temperature
of
degrees
fahrenheit
but
it
chanced
that
unknown
to
cavor
dissension
had
arisen
about
the
furnace
tending
gibbs
who
had
previously
seen
to
this
had
suddenly
attempted
to
shift
it
to
the
man
who
had
been
a
gardener
on
the
score
that
coal
was
soil
being
dug
and
therefore
could
not
possibly
fall
within
the
province
of
a
joiner
the
man
who
had
been
a
jobbing
gardener
alleged
however
that
coal
was
a
metallic
or
substance
let
alone
that
he
was
cook
but
spargus
insisted
on
gibbs
doing
the
coaling
seeing
that
he
was
a
joiner
and
that
coal
is
notoriously
fossil
wood
consequently
gibbs
ceased
to
replenish
the
furnace
and
no
one
else
did
so
and
cavor
was
too
much
immersed
in
certain
interesting
problems
concerning
a
cavorite
flying
machine
neglecting
the
resistance
of
the
air
and
one
or
two
other
points
to
perceive
that
anything
was
wrong
and
the
premature
birth
of
his
invention
took
place
just
as
he
was
coming
across
the
field
to
my
bungalow
for
our
afternoon
talk
and
tea
i
remember
the
occasion
with
extreme
vividness
the
water
was
boiling
and
everything
was
prepared
and
the
sound
of
his
had
brought
me
out
upon
the
verandah
his
active
little
figure
was
black
against
the
autumnal
sunset
and
to
the
right
the
chimneys
of
his
house
just
rose
above
a
gloriously
tinted
group
of
trees
remoter
rose
the
wealden
hills
faint
and
blue
while
to
the
left
the
hazy
marsh
spread
out
spacious
and
serene
and
the
chimneys
jerked
heavenward
smashing
into
a
string
of
bricks
as
they
rose
and
the
roof
and
a
miscellany
of
furniture
followed
then
overtaking
them
came
a
huge
white
flame
the
trees
about
the
building
swayed
and
whirled
and
tore
themselves
to
pieces
that
sprang
towards
the
flare
my
ears
were
smitten
with
a
clap
of
thunder
that
left
me
deaf
on
one
side
for
life
and
all
about
me
windows
smashed
unheeded
i
took
three
steps
from
the
verandah
towards
house
and
even
as
i
did
so
came
the
wind
instantly
my
coat
tails
were
over
my
head
and
i
was
progressing
in
great
leaps
and
bounds
and
quite
against
my
will
towards
him
in
the
same
moment
the
discoverer
was
seized
whirled
about
and
flew
through
the
screaming
air
i
saw
one
of
my
chimney
pots
hit
the
ground
within
six
yards
of
me
leap
a
score
of
feet
and
so
hurry
in
great
strides
towards
the
focus
of
the
disturbance
cavor
kicking
and
flapping
came
down
again
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
ground
for
a
space
struggled
up
and
was
lifted
and
borne
forward
at
an
enormous
velocity
vanishing
at
last
among
the
labouring
lashing
trees
that
writhed
about
his
house
a
mass
of
smoke
and
ashes
and
a
square
of
bluish
shining
substance
rushed
up
towards
the
zenith
a
large
fragment
of
fencing
came
sailing
past
me
dropped
edgeways
hit
the
ground
and
fell
flat
and
then
the
worst
was
over
the
aerial
commotion
fell
swiftly
until
it
was
a
mere
strong
gale
and
i
became
once
more
aware
that
i
had
breath
and
feet
by
leaning
back
against
the
wind
i
managed
to
stop
and
could
collect
such
wits
as
still
remained
to
me
in
that
instant
the
whole
face
of
the
world
had
changed
the
tranquil
sunset
had
vanished
the
sky
was
dark
with
scurrying
clouds
everything
was
flattened
and
swaying
with
the
gale
i
glanced
back
to
see
if
my
bungalow
was
still
in
a
general
way
standing
then
staggered
forwards
towards
the
trees
amongst
which
cavor
had
vanished
and
through
whose
tall
and
branches
shone
the
flames
of
his
burning
house
i
entered
the
copse
dashing
from
one
tree
to
another
and
clinging
to
them
and
for
a
space
i
sought
him
in
vain
then
amidst
a
heap
of
smashed
branches
and
fencing
that
had
banked
itself
against
a
portion
of
his
garden
wall
i
perceived
something
stir
i
made
a
run
for
this
but
before
i
reached
it
a
brown
object
separated
itself
rose
on
two
muddy
legs
and
protruded
two
drooping
bleeding
hands
some
tattered
ends
of
garment
fluttered
out
from
its
middle
portion
and
streamed
before
the
wind
for
a
moment
i
did
not
recognise
this
earthy
lump
and
then
i
saw
that
it
was
cavor
caked
in
the
mud
in
which
he
had
rolled
he
leant
forward
against
the
wind
rubbing
the
dirt
from
his
eyes
and
mouth
he
extended
a
muddy
lump
of
hand
and
staggered
a
pace
towards
me
his
face
worked
with
emotion
little
lumps
of
mud
kept
falling
from
it
he
looked
as
damaged
and
pitiful
as
any
living
creature
i
have
ever
seen
and
his
remark
therefore
amazed
me
exceedingly
me
he
gasped
me
you
said
i
heavens
what
for
done
what
on
earth
caused
that
explosion
a
gust
of
wind
blew
his
words
away
i
understood
him
to
say
that
it
an
explosion
at
all
the
wind
hurled
me
into
collision
with
him
and
we
stood
clinging
to
one
another
and
get
my
bungalow
i
bawled
in
his
ear
he
did
not
hear
me
and
shouted
something
about
and
also
something
about
much
at
the
time
he
laboured
under
the
impression
that
his
three
attendants
had
perished
in
the
whirlwind
happily
this
was
incorrect
directly
he
had
left
for
my
bungalow
they
had
gone
off
to
the
in
lympne
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
furnaces
over
some
trivial
refreshment
i
repeated
my
suggestion
of
getting
back
to
my
bungalow
and
this
time
he
understood
we
clung
and
started
and
managed
at
last
to
reach
the
shelter
of
as
much
roof
as
was
left
to
me
for
a
space
we
sat
in
and
panted
all
the
windows
were
broken
and
the
lighter
articles
of
furniture
were
in
great
disorder
but
no
irrevocable
damage
was
done
happily
the
kitchen
door
had
stood
the
pressure
upon
it
so
that
all
my
crockery
and
cooking
materials
had
survived
the
oil
stove
was
still
burning
and
i
put
on
the
water
to
boil
again
for
tea
and
that
prepared
i
could
turn
on
cavor
for
his
explanation
correct
he
insisted
correct
done
it
and
all
i
protested
right
why
there
be
a
rick
standing
or
a
fence
or
a
thatched
roof
undamaged
for
twenty
miles
round
all
i
of
course
foresee
this
little
upset
my
mind
was
preoccupied
with
another
problem
and
apt
to
disregard
these
practical
side
issues
but
all
dear
sir
i
cried
you
see
done
thousands
of
worth
of
damage
i
throw
myself
on
your
discretion
not
a
practical
man
of
course
but
you
think
they
will
regard
it
as
a
cyclone
the
was
an
explosion
perfectly
simple
only
as
i
say
apt
to
overlook
these
little
things
that
zuzzoo
business
on
a
larger
scale
inadvertently
i
made
this
substance
of
mine
this
cavorite
in
a
thin
wide
sheet
he
paused
are
quite
clear
that
the
stuff
is
opaque
to
gravitation
that
it
cuts
off
things
from
gravitating
towards
each
other
said
i
so
soon
as
it
reached
a
temperature
of
degrees
fahrenheit
and
the
process
of
its
manufacture
was
complete
the
air
above
it
the
portions
of
roof
and
ceiling
and
floor
above
it
ceased
to
have
weight
i
suppose
you
knows
as
a
usual
thing
the
air
weight
that
it
presses
on
everything
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
presses
in
all
directions
with
a
pressure
of
fourteen
and
a
half
pounds
to
the
square
inch
know
that
said
i
know
that
too
he
remarked
this
shows
you
how
useless
knowledge
is
unless
you
apply
it
you
see
over
our
cavorite
this
ceased
to
be
the
case
the
air
there
ceased
to
exert
any
pressure
and
the
air
round
it
and
not
over
the
cavorite
was
exerting
a
pressure
of
fourteen
pounds
and
a
half
to
the
square
inch
upon
this
suddenly
weightless
air
ah
you
begin
to
see
the
air
all
about
the
cavorite
crushed
in
upon
the
air
above
it
with
irresistible
force
the
air
above
the
cavorite
was
forced
upward
violently
the
air
that
rushed
in
to
replace
it
immediately
lost
weight
ceased
to
exert
any
pressure
followed
suit
blew
the
ceiling
through
and
the
roof
off
perceive
he
said
formed
a
sort
of
atmospheric
fountain
a
kind
of
chimney
in
the
atmosphere
and
if
the
cavorite
itself
been
loose
and
so
got
sucked
up
the
chimney
does
it
occur
to
you
what
would
have
happened
i
thought
suppose
i
said
air
would
be
rushing
up
and
up
over
that
infernal
piece
of
stuff
he
said
huge
into
space
good
heavens
why
it
would
have
squirted
all
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
away
it
would
have
robbed
the
world
of
air
it
would
have
been
the
death
of
all
mankind
that
little
lump
of
stuff
exactly
into
space
said
cavor
as
it
would
have
whipped
the
air
off
the
world
as
one
peels
a
banana
and
flung
it
thousands
of
miles
it
would
have
dropped
back
again
of
on
an
asphyxiated
world
from
our
point
of
view
very
little
better
than
if
it
never
came
back
i
stared
as
yet
i
was
too
amazed
to
realise
how
all
my
expectations
had
been
upset
do
you
mean
to
do
now
i
asked
the
first
place
if
i
may
borrow
a
garden
trowel
i
will
remove
some
of
this
earth
with
which
i
am
encased
and
then
if
i
may
avail
myself
of
your
domestic
conveniences
i
will
have
a
bath
this
done
we
will
converse
more
at
leisure
it
will
be
wise
i
laid
a
muddy
hand
on
my
nothing
were
said
of
this
affair
beyond
ourselves
i
know
i
have
caused
great
even
may
be
ruined
here
and
there
upon
the
but
on
the
other
hand
i
can
not
possibly
pay
for
the
damage
i
have
done
and
if
the
real
cause
of
this
is
published
it
will
lead
only
to
heartburning
and
the
obstruction
of
my
work
one
can
not
foresee
you
know
and
i
can
not
consent
for
one
moment
to
add
the
burthen
of
practical
considerations
to
my
theorising
later
on
when
you
have
come
in
with
your
practical
mind
and
cavorite
is
the
word
it
it
has
realised
all
you
anticipate
for
it
we
may
set
matters
right
with
these
persons
but
not
now
if
no
other
explanation
is
offered
people
in
the
present
unsatisfactory
state
of
meteorological
science
will
ascribe
all
this
to
a
cyclone
there
might
be
a
public
subscription
and
as
my
house
has
collapsed
and
been
burnt
i
should
in
that
case
receive
a
considerable
share
in
the
compensation
which
would
be
extremely
helpful
to
the
prosecution
of
our
researches
but
if
it
is
known
that
caused
this
there
will
be
no
public
subscription
and
everybody
will
be
put
out
practically
i
should
never
get
a
chance
of
working
in
peace
again
my
three
assistants
may
or
may
not
have
perished
that
is
a
detail
if
they
have
it
is
no
great
loss
they
were
more
zealous
than
able
and
this
premature
event
must
be
largely
due
to
their
joint
neglect
of
the
furnace
if
they
have
not
perished
i
doubt
if
they
have
the
intelligence
to
explain
the
affair
they
will
accept
the
cyclone
story
and
if
during
the
temporary
unfitness
of
my
house
for
occupation
i
may
lodge
in
one
of
the
untenanted
rooms
of
this
bungalow
of
he
paused
and
regarded
me
a
man
of
such
possibilities
i
reflected
is
no
ordinary
guest
to
entertain
said
i
rising
to
my
feet
had
better
begin
by
looking
for
a
trowel
and
i
led
the
way
to
the
scattered
vestiges
of
the
greenhouse
and
while
he
was
having
his
bath
i
considered
the
entire
question
alone
it
was
clear
there
were
drawbacks
to
society
i
had
not
foreseen
the
absentmindedness
that
had
just
escaped
depopulating
the
terrestrial
globe
might
at
any
moment
result
in
some
other
grave
inconvenience
on
the
other
hand
i
was
young
my
affairs
were
in
a
mess
and
i
was
in
just
the
mood
for
reckless
a
chance
of
something
good
at
the
end
of
it
i
had
quite
settled
in
my
mind
that
i
was
to
have
half
at
least
in
that
aspect
of
the
affair
fortunately
i
held
my
bungalow
as
i
have
already
explained
on
a
agreement
without
being
responsible
for
repairs
and
my
furniture
such
as
there
was
of
it
had
been
hastily
purchased
was
unpaid
for
insured
and
altogether
devoid
of
associations
in
the
end
i
decided
to
keep
on
with
him
and
see
the
business
through
certainly
the
aspect
of
things
had
changed
very
greatly
i
no
longer
doubted
at
all
the
enormous
possibilities
of
the
substance
but
i
began
to
have
doubts
about
the
and
the
patent
boots
we
set
to
work
at
once
to
reconstruct
his
laboratory
and
proceed
with
our
experiments
cavor
talked
more
on
my
level
than
he
had
ever
done
before
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
how
we
should
make
the
stuff
next
course
we
must
make
it
again
he
said
with
a
sort
of
glee
i
had
not
expected
in
him
course
we
must
make
it
again
we
have
caught
a
tartar
perhaps
but
we
have
left
the
theoretical
behind
us
for
good
and
all
if
we
can
possibly
avoid
wrecking
this
little
planet
of
ours
we
will
be
risks
there
must
be
in
experimental
work
there
always
are
and
here
as
a
practical
man
must
come
in
for
my
own
part
it
seems
to
me
we
might
make
it
edgeways
perhaps
and
very
thin
yet
i
know
i
have
a
certain
dim
perception
of
another
method
i
can
hardly
explain
it
yet
but
curiously
enough
it
came
into
my
mind
while
i
was
rolling
over
and
over
in
the
mud
before
the
wind
and
very
doubtful
how
the
whole
adventure
was
to
end
as
being
absolutely
the
thing
i
ought
to
have
even
with
my
aid
we
found
some
little
difficulty
and
meanwhile
we
kept
at
work
restoring
the
laboratory
there
was
plenty
to
do
before
it
became
absolutely
necessary
to
decide
upon
the
precise
form
and
method
of
our
second
attempt
our
only
hitch
was
the
strike
of
the
three
labourers
who
objected
to
my
activity
as
a
foreman
but
that
matter
we
compromised
after
two
delay
iii
the
building
of
the
sphere
i
remember
the
occasion
very
distinctly
when
cavor
told
me
of
his
idea
of
the
sphere
he
had
had
intimations
of
it
before
but
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
come
to
him
in
a
rush
we
were
returning
to
the
bungalow
for
tea
and
on
the
way
he
fell
humming
suddenly
he
shouted
it
that
finishes
it
a
sort
of
roller
blind
what
i
asked
the
do
you
mean
must
be
a
sphere
what
i
mean
i
saw
i
was
out
of
it
and
for
a
time
i
let
him
talk
in
his
own
fashion
i
the
ghost
of
an
idea
then
of
his
drift
but
after
he
had
taken
tea
he
made
it
clear
to
me
like
this
he
said
time
i
ran
this
stuff
that
cuts
things
off
from
gravitation
into
a
flat
tank
with
an
overlap
that
held
it
down
and
directly
it
had
cooled
and
the
manufacture
was
completed
all
that
uproar
happened
nothing
above
it
weighed
anything
the
air
went
squirting
up
the
house
squirted
up
and
if
the
stuff
itself
squirted
up
too
i
know
what
would
have
happened
but
suppose
the
substance
is
loose
and
quite
free
to
go
up
will
go
up
at
once
with
no
more
disturbance
than
firing
a
big
what
good
will
that
do
going
up
with
it
i
put
down
my
teacup
and
stared
at
him
a
sphere
he
explained
enough
to
hold
two
people
and
their
luggage
it
will
be
made
of
steel
lined
with
thick
glass
it
will
contain
a
proper
store
of
solidified
air
concentrated
food
water
distilling
apparatus
and
so
forth
and
enamelled
as
it
were
on
the
outer
how
will
you
get
inside
was
a
similar
problem
about
a
i
know
but
how
perfectly
easy
an
manhole
is
all
that
is
needed
that
of
course
will
have
to
be
a
little
complicated
there
will
have
to
be
a
valve
so
that
things
may
be
thrown
out
if
necessary
without
much
loss
of
jules
thing
in
trip
to
the
but
cavor
was
not
a
reader
of
fiction
begin
to
see
i
said
slowly
you
could
get
in
and
screw
yourself
up
while
the
cavorite
was
warm
and
as
soon
as
it
cooled
it
would
become
impervious
to
gravitation
and
off
you
would
a
would
go
off
in
a
straight
i
stopped
abruptly
is
to
prevent
the
thing
travelling
in
a
straight
line
into
space
for
ever
i
asked
not
safe
to
get
anywhere
and
if
you
will
you
get
back
just
thought
of
that
said
cavor
what
i
meant
when
i
said
the
thing
is
finished
the
inner
glass
sphere
can
be
and
except
for
the
manhole
continuous
and
the
steel
sphere
can
be
made
in
sections
each
section
capable
of
rolling
up
after
the
fashion
of
a
roller
blind
these
can
easily
be
worked
by
springs
and
released
and
checked
by
electricity
conveyed
by
platinum
wires
fused
through
the
glass
all
that
is
merely
a
question
of
detail
so
you
see
that
except
for
the
thickness
of
the
blind
rollers
the
cavorite
exterior
of
the
sphere
will
consist
of
windows
or
blinds
whichever
you
like
to
call
them
well
when
all
these
windows
or
blinds
are
shut
no
light
no
heat
no
gravitation
no
radiant
energy
of
any
sort
will
get
at
the
inside
of
the
sphere
it
will
fly
on
through
space
in
a
straight
line
as
you
say
but
open
a
window
imagine
one
of
the
windows
open
then
at
once
any
heavy
body
that
chances
to
be
in
that
direction
will
attract
i
sat
taking
it
in
see
he
said
i
we
shall
be
able
to
tack
about
in
space
just
as
we
wish
get
attracted
by
this
and
yes
clear
enough
quite
see
what
we
shall
do
it
for
really
only
jumping
off
the
world
and
back
for
example
one
might
go
to
the
when
one
got
there
what
would
you
find
should
consider
the
new
there
air
there
may
a
fine
idea
i
said
it
strikes
me
as
a
large
order
all
the
same
the
moon
much
rather
try
some
smaller
things
out
of
the
question
because
of
the
air
not
apply
that
idea
of
spring
blinds
in
strong
steel
lifting
weights
work
he
insisted
all
to
go
into
outer
space
is
not
so
much
worse
if
at
all
than
a
polar
expedition
men
go
on
polar
business
men
and
besides
they
get
paid
for
polar
expeditions
and
if
anything
goes
wrong
there
are
relief
parties
but
just
firing
ourselves
off
the
world
for
it
have
to
call
it
that
one
might
make
a
book
of
it
perhaps
i
said
have
no
doubt
there
will
be
minerals
said
cavor
example
sulphur
ores
gold
perhaps
possibly
new
of
carriage
i
said
know
a
practical
man
the
a
quarter
of
a
million
miles
seems
to
me
it
cost
much
to
cart
any
weight
anywhere
if
you
packed
it
in
a
cavorite
i
had
not
thought
of
that
free
on
head
of
purchaser
eh
as
though
we
were
confined
to
the
mean
atmosphere
novel
surroundings
exhilarating
sense
of
lightness
it
might
be
pleasant
to
go
there
air
on
mars
yes
as
though
you
might
run
it
as
a
sanatorium
by
the
way
how
far
is
mars
hundred
million
miles
at
present
said
cavor
airily
you
go
close
by
the
my
imagination
was
picking
itself
up
again
all
i
said
something
in
these
things
an
extraordinary
possibility
came
rushing
into
my
mind
suddenly
i
saw
as
in
a
vision
the
whole
solar
system
threaded
with
cavorite
liners
and
spheres
of
came
floating
into
my
rights
of
i
recalled
the
old
spanish
monopoly
in
american
gold
it
as
though
it
was
just
this
planet
or
was
all
of
them
i
stared
at
rubicund
face
and
suddenly
my
imagination
was
leaping
and
dancing
i
stood
up
i
walked
up
and
down
my
tongue
was
unloosened
beginning
to
take
it
in
i
said
beginning
to
take
it
the
transition
from
doubt
to
enthusiasm
seemed
to
take
scarcely
any
time
at
all
this
is
tremendous
i
cried
is
imperial
i
been
dreaming
of
this
sort
of
once
the
chill
of
my
opposition
was
removed
his
own
excitement
had
play
he
too
got
up
and
paced
he
too
gesticulated
and
shouted
we
behaved
like
men
inspired
we
men
inspired
settle
all
that
he
said
in
answer
to
some
incidental
difficulty
that
had
pulled
me
up
soon
settle
that
start
the
drawings
for
mouldings
this
very
start
them
now
i
responded
and
we
hurried
off
to
the
laboratory
to
begin
upon
this
work
forthwith
i
was
like
a
child
in
wonderland
all
that
night
the
dawn
found
us
both
still
at
kept
our
electric
light
going
heedless
of
the
day
i
remember
now
exactly
how
these
drawings
looked
i
shaded
and
tinted
while
cavor
and
they
were
in
every
line
but
wonderfully
correct
we
got
out
the
orders
for
the
steel
blinds
and
frames
we
needed
from
that
work
and
the
glass
sphere
was
designed
within
a
week
we
gave
up
our
afternoon
conversations
and
our
old
routine
altogether
we
worked
and
we
slept
and
ate
when
we
could
work
no
longer
for
hunger
and
fatigue
our
enthusiasm
infected
even
our
three
men
though
they
had
no
idea
what
the
sphere
was
for
through
those
days
the
man
gibbs
gave
up
walking
and
went
everywhere
even
across
the
room
at
a
sort
of
fussy
run
and
it
sphere
december
passed
spent
a
day
with
a
broom
sweeping
a
path
through
the
snow
from
bungalow
to
march
by
the
end
of
march
the
completion
was
in
sight
in
january
had
come
a
team
of
horses
a
huge
we
had
our
thick
glass
sphere
now
ready
and
in
position
under
the
crane
we
had
rigged
to
sling
it
into
the
steel
shell
all
the
bars
and
blinds
of
the
steel
was
not
really
a
spherical
shell
but
polyhedral
with
a
roller
blind
to
each
arrived
by
february
and
the
lower
half
was
bolted
together
the
cavorite
was
half
made
by
march
the
metallic
paste
had
gone
through
two
of
the
stages
in
its
manufacture
and
we
had
plastered
quite
half
of
it
on
to
the
steel
bars
and
blinds
it
was
astonishing
how
closely
we
kept
to
the
lines
of
first
inspiration
in
working
out
the
scheme
when
the
bolting
together
of
the
sphere
was
finished
he
proposed
to
remove
the
rough
roof
of
the
temporary
laboratory
in
which
the
work
was
done
and
build
a
furnace
about
it
so
the
last
stage
of
cavorite
making
in
which
the
paste
is
heated
to
a
dull
red
glow
in
a
stream
of
helium
would
be
accomplished
when
it
was
already
on
the
sphere
and
then
we
had
to
discuss
and
decide
what
provisions
we
were
to
foods
concentrated
essences
steel
cylinders
containing
reserve
oxygen
an
arrangement
for
removing
carbonic
acid
and
waste
from
the
air
and
restoring
oxygen
by
means
of
sodium
peroxide
water
condensers
and
so
forth
i
remember
the
little
heap
they
made
in
the
and
rolls
and
it
was
a
strenuous
time
with
little
chance
of
thinking
but
one
day
when
we
were
drawing
near
the
end
an
odd
mood
came
over
me
i
had
been
bricking
up
the
furnace
all
the
morning
and
i
sat
down
by
these
possessions
dead
beat
everything
seemed
dull
and
incredible
look
here
cavor
i
said
all
it
all
for
he
smiled
thing
now
is
to
moon
i
reflected
what
do
you
expect
i
thought
the
moon
was
a
dead
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
going
to
we
i
said
and
stared
before
me
are
tired
he
remarked
better
take
a
walk
this
i
said
obstinately
going
to
finish
this
and
i
did
and
insured
myself
a
night
of
insomnia
i
think
i
have
ever
had
such
a
night
i
had
some
bad
times
before
my
business
collapse
but
the
very
worst
of
those
was
sweet
slumber
compared
to
this
infinity
of
aching
wakefulness
i
was
suddenly
in
the
most
enormous
funk
at
the
thing
we
were
going
to
do
i
do
not
remember
before
that
night
thinking
at
all
of
the
risks
we
were
running
now
they
came
like
that
array
of
spectres
that
once
beleaguered
prague
and
camped
around
me
the
strangeness
of
what
we
were
about
to
do
the
unearthliness
of
it
overwhelmed
me
i
was
like
a
man
awakened
out
of
pleasant
dreams
to
the
most
horrible
surroundings
i
lay
eyes
wide
open
and
the
sphere
seemed
to
get
more
flimsy
and
feeble
and
cavor
more
unreal
and
fantastic
and
the
whole
enterprise
madder
and
madder
every
moment
i
got
out
of
bed
and
wandered
about
i
sat
at
the
window
and
stared
at
the
immensity
of
space
between
the
stars
was
the
void
the
unfathomable
darkness
i
tried
to
recall
the
fragmentary
knowledge
of
astronomy
i
had
gained
in
my
irregular
reading
but
it
was
all
too
vague
to
furnish
any
idea
of
the
things
we
might
expect
at
last
i
got
back
to
bed
and
snatched
some
moments
of
of
nightmare
which
i
fell
and
fell
and
fell
for
evermore
into
the
abyss
of
the
sky
i
astonished
cavor
at
breakfast
i
told
him
shortly
not
coming
with
you
in
the
i
met
all
his
protests
with
a
sullen
persistence
too
mad
i
said
i
come
the
too
i
would
not
go
with
him
to
the
laboratory
i
fretted
about
my
bungalow
for
a
time
and
then
took
hat
and
stick
and
set
out
alone
i
knew
not
whither
it
chanced
to
be
a
glorious
morning
a
warm
wind
and
deep
blue
sky
the
first
green
of
spring
abroad
and
multitudes
of
birds
singing
i
lunched
on
beef
and
beer
in
a
little
near
elham
and
startled
the
landlord
by
remarking
of
the
weather
man
who
leaves
the
world
when
days
of
this
sort
are
about
is
a
fool
what
i
says
when
i
heerd
on
it
said
the
landlord
and
i
found
that
for
one
poor
soul
at
least
this
world
had
proved
excessive
and
there
had
been
a
i
went
on
with
a
new
twist
to
my
thoughts
in
the
afternoon
i
had
a
pleasant
sleep
in
a
sunny
place
and
went
on
my
way
refreshed
i
came
to
a
inn
near
canterbury
it
was
bright
with
creepers
and
the
landlady
was
a
clean
old
woman
and
took
my
eye
i
found
i
had
just
enough
money
to
pay
for
my
lodging
with
her
i
decided
to
stop
the
night
there
she
was
a
talkative
body
and
among
many
other
particulars
i
learnt
she
had
never
been
to
london
as
far
as
ever
i
been
she
said
not
one
of
your
would
you
like
a
trip
to
the
moon
i
cried
never
did
hold
with
them
ballooneys
she
said
evidently
under
the
impression
that
this
was
a
common
excursion
enough
go
up
in
for
ever
this
struck
me
as
being
funny
after
i
had
supped
i
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
door
of
the
inn
and
gossiped
with
two
labourers
about
brickmaking
and
motor
cars
and
the
cricket
of
last
year
and
in
the
sky
a
faint
new
crescent
blue
and
vague
as
a
distant
alp
sank
westward
over
the
sun
the
next
day
i
returned
to
cavor
am
coming
i
said
been
a
little
out
of
order
that
was
the
only
time
i
felt
any
serious
doubt
our
enterprise
nerves
purely
after
that
i
worked
a
little
more
carefully
and
took
a
trudge
for
an
hour
every
day
and
at
last
save
for
the
heating
in
the
furnace
our
labours
were
at
an
end
iv
inside
the
sphere
on
said
cavor
as
i
sat
across
the
edge
of
the
manhole
and
looked
down
into
the
black
interior
of
the
sphere
we
two
were
alone
it
was
evening
the
sun
had
set
and
the
stillness
of
the
twilight
was
upon
everything
i
drew
my
other
leg
inside
and
slid
down
the
smooth
glass
to
the
bottom
of
the
sphere
then
turned
to
take
the
cans
of
food
and
other
impedimenta
from
cavor
the
interior
was
warm
the
thermometer
stood
at
eighty
and
as
we
should
lose
little
or
none
of
this
by
radiation
we
were
dressed
in
shoes
and
thin
flannels
we
had
however
a
bundle
of
thick
woollen
clothing
and
several
thick
blankets
to
guard
against
mischance
by
direction
i
placed
the
packages
the
cylinders
of
oxygen
and
so
forth
loosely
about
my
feet
and
soon
we
had
everything
in
he
walked
about
the
roofless
shed
for
a
time
seeking
anything
we
had
overlooked
and
then
crawled
in
after
me
i
noted
something
in
his
hand
have
you
got
there
i
asked
you
brought
anything
to
read
lord
forgot
to
tell
you
there
are
the
voyage
may
we
may
be
weeks
shall
be
floating
in
this
sphere
with
absolutely
no
wish
he
peered
out
of
the
manhole
he
said
something
there
there
time
shall
be
an
i
looked
out
it
was
an
old
number
of
that
one
of
the
men
must
have
brought
farther
away
in
the
corner
i
saw
a
torn
i
scrambled
back
into
the
sphere
with
these
things
have
you
got
i
said
i
took
the
book
from
his
hand
and
read
works
of
william
he
coloured
slightly
education
has
been
so
purely
he
said
apologetically
read
him
knew
a
little
you
an
irregular
sort
of
what
i
am
told
said
cavor
i
assisted
him
to
screw
in
the
glass
cover
of
the
manhole
and
then
he
pressed
a
stud
to
close
the
corresponding
blind
in
the
outer
case
the
little
oblong
of
twilight
vanished
we
were
in
darkness
for
a
time
neither
of
us
spoke
although
our
case
would
not
be
impervious
to
sound
everything
was
very
still
i
perceived
there
was
nothing
to
grip
when
the
shock
of
our
start
should
come
and
i
realised
that
i
should
be
uncomfortable
for
want
of
a
chair
have
we
no
chairs
i
asked
settled
all
that
said
cavor
need
not
will
see
he
said
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
refuses
to
talk
i
became
silent
suddenly
it
had
come
to
me
clear
and
vivid
that
i
was
a
fool
to
be
inside
that
sphere
even
now
i
asked
myself
is
to
too
late
to
withdraw
the
world
outside
the
sphere
i
knew
would
be
cold
and
inhospitable
enough
for
weeks
i
had
been
living
on
subsidies
from
after
all
would
it
be
as
cold
as
the
infinite
zero
as
inhospitable
as
empty
space
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
appearance
of
cowardice
i
believe
that
even
then
i
should
have
made
him
let
me
out
but
i
hesitated
on
that
score
and
hesitated
and
grew
fretful
and
angry
and
the
time
passed
there
came
a
little
jerk
a
noise
like
champagne
being
uncorked
in
another
room
and
a
faint
whistling
sound
for
just
one
instant
i
had
a
sense
of
enormous
tension
a
transient
conviction
that
my
feet
were
pressing
downward
with
a
force
of
countless
tons
it
lasted
for
an
infinitesimal
time
but
it
stirred
me
to
action
i
said
into
the
darkness
in
rags
i
i
stopped
he
made
no
answer
it
i
cried
a
fool
what
business
have
i
here
not
coming
cavor
the
too
risky
getting
he
said
soon
see
about
that
he
made
no
answer
for
ten
seconds
too
late
for
us
to
quarrel
now
bedford
he
said
little
jerk
was
the
start
already
we
are
flying
as
swiftly
as
a
bullet
up
into
the
gulf
of
i
said
and
then
it
seem
to
matter
what
happened
for
a
time
i
was
as
it
were
stunned
i
had
nothing
to
say
it
was
just
as
if
i
had
never
heard
of
this
idea
of
leaving
the
world
before
then
i
perceived
an
unaccountable
change
in
my
bodily
sensations
it
was
a
feeling
of
lightness
of
unreality
coupled
with
that
was
a
queer
sensation
in
the
head
an
apoplectic
effect
almost
and
a
thumping
of
blood
vessels
at
the
ears
neither
of
these
feelings
diminished
as
time
went
on
but
at
last
i
got
so
used
to
them
that
i
experienced
no
inconvenience
i
heard
a
click
and
a
little
glow
lamp
came
into
being
i
saw
face
as
white
as
i
felt
my
own
to
be
we
regarded
one
another
in
silence
the
transparent
blackness
of
the
glass
behind
him
made
him
seem
as
though
he
floated
in
a
void
committed
i
said
at
last
he
said
move
he
exclaimed
at
some
suggestion
of
a
gesture
your
muscles
keep
quite
if
you
were
in
bed
we
are
in
a
little
universe
of
our
own
look
at
those
things
he
pointed
to
the
loose
cases
and
bundles
that
had
been
lying
on
the
blankets
in
the
bottom
of
the
sphere
i
was
astonished
to
see
that
they
were
floating
now
nearly
a
foot
from
the
spherical
wall
then
i
saw
from
his
shadow
that
cavor
was
no
longer
leaning
against
the
glass
i
thrust
out
my
hand
behind
me
and
found
that
i
too
was
suspended
in
space
clear
of
the
glass
i
did
not
cry
out
nor
gesticulate
but
fear
came
upon
me
it
was
like
being
held
and
lifted
by
know
not
what
the
mere
touch
of
my
hand
against
the
glass
moved
me
rapidly
i
understood
what
had
happened
but
that
did
not
prevent
my
being
afraid
we
were
cut
off
from
all
exterior
gravitation
only
the
attraction
of
objects
within
our
sphere
had
effect
consequently
everything
that
was
not
fixed
to
the
glass
was
because
of
the
slightness
of
our
the
centre
of
gravity
of
our
little
world
which
seemed
to
be
somewhere
about
the
middle
of
the
sphere
but
rather
nearer
to
myself
than
cavor
on
account
of
my
greater
weight
must
turn
round
said
cavor
float
back
to
back
with
the
things
between
it
was
the
strangest
sensation
conceivable
floating
thus
loosely
in
space
at
first
indeed
horribly
strange
and
when
the
horror
passed
not
disagreeable
at
all
exceeding
restful
indeed
the
nearest
thing
in
earthly
experience
to
it
that
i
know
is
lying
on
a
very
thick
soft
feather
bed
but
the
quality
of
utter
detachment
and
independence
i
had
not
reckoned
on
things
like
this
i
had
expected
a
violent
jerk
at
starting
a
giddy
sense
of
speed
instead
i
if
i
were
disembodied
it
was
not
like
the
beginning
of
a
journey
it
was
like
the
beginning
of
a
dream
the
journey
to
the
moon
presently
cavor
extinguished
the
light
he
said
we
had
not
overmuch
energy
stored
and
that
what
we
had
we
must
economise
for
reading
for
a
time
whether
it
was
long
or
short
i
do
not
know
there
was
nothing
but
blank
darkness
a
question
floated
up
out
of
the
void
are
we
pointing
i
said
is
our
direction
are
flying
away
from
the
earth
at
a
tangent
and
as
the
moon
is
near
her
third
quarter
we
are
going
somewhere
towards
her
i
will
open
a
came
a
click
and
then
a
window
in
the
outer
case
yawned
open
the
sky
outside
was
as
black
as
the
darkness
within
the
sphere
but
the
shape
of
the
open
window
was
marked
by
an
infinite
number
of
stars
those
who
have
only
seen
the
starry
sky
from
the
earth
can
not
imagine
its
appearance
when
the
vague
half
luminous
veil
of
our
air
has
been
withdrawn
the
stars
we
see
on
earth
are
the
mere
scattered
survivors
that
penetrate
our
misty
atmosphere
but
now
at
last
i
could
realise
the
meaning
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
stranger
things
we
were
presently
to
see
but
that
airless
sky
of
all
things
i
think
that
will
be
one
of
the
last
i
shall
forget
the
little
window
vanished
with
a
click
another
beside
it
snapped
open
and
instantly
closed
and
then
a
third
and
for
a
moment
i
had
to
close
my
eyes
because
of
the
blinding
splendour
of
the
waning
moon
for
a
space
i
had
to
stare
at
cavor
and
the
things
about
me
to
season
my
eyes
to
light
again
before
i
could
turn
them
towards
that
pallid
glare
four
windows
were
open
in
order
that
the
gravitation
of
the
moon
might
act
upon
all
the
substances
in
our
sphere
i
found
i
was
no
longer
floating
freely
in
space
but
that
my
feet
were
resting
on
the
glass
in
the
direction
of
the
moon
the
blankets
and
cases
of
provisions
were
also
creeping
slowly
down
the
glass
and
presently
came
to
rest
so
as
to
block
out
a
portion
of
the
view
it
seemed
to
me
of
course
that
i
looked
when
i
looked
at
the
moon
on
earth
means
earthward
the
way
things
fall
and
the
reverse
direction
now
the
pull
of
gravitation
was
towards
the
moon
and
for
all
i
knew
to
the
contrary
our
earth
was
overhead
and
of
course
when
all
the
cavorite
blinds
were
closed
was
towards
the
centre
of
our
sphere
and
towards
its
outer
wall
it
was
curiously
unlike
earthly
experience
too
to
have
the
light
coming
to
one
on
earth
light
falls
from
above
or
comes
slanting
down
sideways
but
here
it
came
from
beneath
our
feet
and
to
see
our
shadows
we
had
to
look
up
at
first
it
gave
me
a
sort
of
vertigo
to
stand
only
on
thick
glass
and
look
down
upon
the
moon
through
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
of
vacant
space
but
this
sickness
passed
very
speedily
and
splendour
of
the
sight
the
reader
may
imagine
it
best
if
he
will
lie
on
the
ground
some
warm
night
and
look
between
his
upraised
feet
at
the
moon
but
for
some
reason
probably
because
the
absence
of
air
made
it
so
much
more
luminous
the
moon
seemed
already
considerably
larger
than
it
does
from
earth
the
minutest
details
of
its
surface
were
acutely
clear
and
since
we
did
not
see
it
through
air
its
outline
was
bright
and
sharp
there
was
no
glow
or
halo
about
it
and
the
that
covered
the
sky
came
right
to
its
very
margin
and
marked
the
outline
of
its
unilluminated
part
and
as
i
stood
and
stared
at
the
moon
between
my
feet
that
perception
of
the
impossible
that
had
been
with
me
off
and
on
ever
since
our
start
returned
again
with
tenfold
conviction
i
said
takes
me
queerly
those
companies
we
were
going
to
run
and
all
that
about
minerals
see
said
cavor
get
over
all
suppose
made
to
turn
right
side
up
again
still
for
a
moment
i
could
half
believe
there
never
was
a
copy
of
might
help
i
stared
at
the
paper
for
a
moment
then
held
it
above
the
level
of
my
face
and
found
i
could
read
it
quite
easily
i
struck
a
column
of
mean
little
advertisements
gentleman
of
private
means
is
willing
to
lend
money
i
read
i
knew
that
gentleman
then
somebody
eccentric
wanted
to
sell
a
cutaway
bicycle
new
and
cost
for
five
pounds
and
a
lady
in
distress
wished
to
dispose
of
some
fish
knives
and
forks
wedding
present
at
a
great
sacrifice
no
doubt
some
simple
soul
was
sagely
examining
these
knives
and
forks
and
another
triumphantly
riding
off
on
that
bicycle
and
a
third
trustfully
consulting
that
benevolent
gentleman
of
means
even
as
i
read
i
laughed
and
let
the
paper
drift
from
my
hand
we
visible
from
the
earth
i
asked
knew
some
one
who
was
rather
interested
in
astronomy
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
rather
odd
to
be
looking
through
some
would
need
the
most
powerful
telescope
on
earth
even
now
to
see
us
as
the
minutest
for
a
time
i
stared
in
silence
at
the
moon
a
world
i
said
feels
that
infinitely
more
than
one
ever
did
on
earth
people
he
exclaimed
banish
all
that
think
yourself
a
sort
of
voyager
exploring
the
desolate
places
of
space
look
at
it
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
shining
whiteness
below
vast
extinct
volcanoes
lava
wildernesses
tumbled
wastes
of
snow
or
frozen
carbonic
acid
or
frozen
air
and
everywhere
landslip
seams
and
cracks
and
gulfs
nothing
happens
men
have
watched
this
planet
systematically
with
telescopes
for
over
two
hundred
years
how
much
change
do
you
think
they
have
seen
have
traced
two
indisputable
landslips
a
doubtful
crack
and
one
slight
periodic
change
of
colour
and
know
traced
even
yes
but
as
for
the
way
i
asked
small
a
thing
will
the
biggest
telescopes
show
upon
the
moon
could
see
a
church
one
could
certainly
see
any
towns
or
buildings
or
anything
like
the
handiwork
of
men
there
might
perhaps
be
insects
something
in
the
way
of
ants
for
example
so
that
they
could
hide
in
deep
burrows
from
the
lunar
light
or
some
new
sort
of
creatures
having
no
earthly
parallel
that
is
the
most
probable
thing
if
we
are
to
find
life
there
at
all
think
of
the
difference
in
conditions
life
must
fit
itself
to
a
day
as
long
as
fourteen
earthly
days
a
cloudless
of
fourteen
days
and
then
a
night
of
equal
length
growing
ever
colder
and
colder
under
these
cold
sharp
stars
in
that
night
there
must
be
cold
the
ultimate
cold
absolute
zero
below
the
earthly
freezing
point
whatever
life
there
is
must
hibernate
through
and
rise
again
each
he
mused
can
imagine
something
he
said
its
air
solid
as
an
swallows
earth
or
the
bye
i
said
we
bring
a
gun
he
did
not
answer
that
question
he
concluded
just
have
to
go
we
shall
see
when
we
get
i
remembered
something
course
my
minerals
anyhow
i
said
the
conditions
may
presently
he
told
me
he
wished
to
alter
our
course
a
little
by
letting
the
earth
tug
at
us
for
a
moment
he
was
going
to
open
one
earthward
blind
for
thirty
seconds
he
warned
me
that
it
would
make
my
head
swim
and
advised
me
to
extend
my
hands
against
the
glass
to
break
my
fall
i
did
as
he
directed
and
thrust
my
feet
against
the
bales
of
food
cases
and
air
cylinders
to
prevent
their
falling
upon
me
then
with
a
click
the
window
flew
open
i
fell
clumsily
upon
hands
and
face
and
saw
for
a
moment
between
my
black
extended
fingers
our
mother
planet
in
a
downward
sky
we
were
still
very
told
me
the
distance
was
perhaps
eight
hundred
miles
and
the
huge
terrestrial
disc
filled
all
heaven
but
already
it
was
plain
to
see
that
the
world
was
a
globe
the
land
below
us
was
in
twilight
and
vague
but
westward
the
vast
grey
stretches
of
the
atlantic
shone
like
molten
silver
under
the
receding
day
i
think
i
recognised
the
of
france
and
spain
and
the
south
of
england
and
then
with
a
click
the
shutter
closed
again
and
i
found
myself
in
a
state
of
extraordinary
confusion
sliding
slowly
over
the
smooth
glass
when
at
last
things
settled
themselves
in
my
mind
again
it
seemed
quite
beyond
question
that
the
moon
was
and
under
my
feet
and
that
the
earth
was
somewhere
away
on
the
level
of
the
earth
that
had
been
to
me
and
my
kindred
since
the
beginning
of
things
so
slight
were
the
exertions
required
of
us
so
easy
did
the
practical
annihilation
of
our
weight
make
all
we
had
to
do
that
the
necessity
for
taking
refreshment
did
not
occur
to
us
for
nearly
six
hours
by
chronometer
after
our
start
i
was
amazed
at
that
lapse
of
time
even
then
i
was
satisfied
with
very
little
cavor
examined
the
apparatus
for
absorbing
carbonic
acid
and
water
and
pronounced
it
to
be
in
satisfactory
order
our
consumption
of
oxygen
having
been
extraordinarily
slight
and
our
talk
being
exhausted
for
the
time
and
there
being
nothing
further
for
us
to
do
we
gave
way
to
a
curious
drowsiness
that
had
come
upon
us
and
spreading
our
blankets
on
the
bottom
of
the
sphere
in
such
a
manner
as
to
shut
out
most
of
the
moonlight
wished
each
other
and
almost
immediately
fell
asleep
and
so
sleeping
and
sometimes
talking
and
reading
a
little
and
at
times
eating
although
without
any
keenness
of
appetite
but
for
the
most
part
in
a
sort
of
quiescence
that
was
neither
waking
nor
slumber
we
fell
through
a
space
of
time
that
had
neither
night
nor
day
in
it
silently
softly
and
swiftly
down
towards
the
moon
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
while
we
were
in
the
sphere
we
felt
not
the
slightest
desire
for
food
nor
did
we
feel
the
want
of
it
when
we
abstained
at
first
we
forced
our
appetites
but
afterwards
we
fasted
completely
altogether
we
did
not
consume
part
of
the
compressed
provisions
we
had
brought
with
us
the
amount
of
carbonic
acid
we
breathed
was
also
unnaturally
low
but
why
this
was
i
am
quite
unable
to
explain
vi
the
landing
on
the
moon
i
remember
how
one
day
cavor
suddenly
opened
six
of
our
shutters
and
blinded
me
so
that
i
cried
aloud
at
him
the
whole
area
was
moon
a
stupendous
scimitar
of
white
dawn
with
its
edge
hacked
out
by
notches
of
darkness
the
crescent
shore
of
an
ebbing
tide
of
darkness
out
of
which
peaks
and
pinnacles
came
glittering
into
the
blaze
of
the
sun
i
take
it
the
reader
has
seen
pictures
or
photographs
of
the
moon
and
that
i
need
not
describe
the
broader
features
of
that
landscape
those
spacious
ranges
vaster
than
any
terrestrial
mountains
their
summits
shining
in
the
day
their
shadows
harsh
and
deep
the
grey
disordered
plains
the
ridges
hills
and
craterlets
all
passing
at
last
from
a
blazing
illumination
into
a
common
mystery
of
black
athwart
this
world
we
were
flying
scarcely
a
hundred
miles
above
its
crests
and
pinnacles
and
now
we
could
see
what
no
eye
on
earth
will
ever
see
that
under
the
blaze
of
the
day
the
harsh
outlines
of
the
rocks
and
ravines
of
the
plains
and
crater
floor
grew
grey
and
indistinct
under
a
thickening
haze
that
the
white
of
their
lit
surfaces
broke
into
lumps
and
patches
and
broke
again
and
shrank
and
vanished
and
that
here
and
there
strange
tints
of
brown
and
olive
grew
and
spread
but
little
time
we
had
for
watching
then
for
now
we
had
come
to
the
real
danger
of
our
journey
we
had
to
drop
ever
closer
to
the
moon
as
we
spun
about
it
to
slacken
our
pace
and
watch
our
chance
until
at
last
we
could
dare
to
drop
upon
its
surface
for
cavor
that
was
a
time
of
intense
exertion
for
me
it
was
an
anxious
inactivity
i
seemed
perpetually
to
be
getting
out
of
his
way
he
leapt
about
the
sphere
from
point
to
point
with
an
agility
that
would
have
been
impossible
on
earth
he
was
perpetually
opening
and
closing
the
cavorite
windows
making
calculations
consulting
his
chronometer
by
means
of
the
glow
lamp
during
those
last
eventful
hours
for
a
long
time
we
had
all
our
windows
closed
and
hung
silently
in
darkness
hurling
through
space
then
he
was
feeling
for
the
shutter
studs
and
suddenly
four
windows
were
open
i
staggered
and
covered
my
eyes
drenched
and
scorched
and
blinded
by
the
unaccustomed
splendour
of
the
sun
beneath
my
feet
then
again
the
shutters
snapped
leaving
my
brain
spinning
in
a
darkness
that
pressed
against
the
eyes
and
after
that
i
floated
in
another
vast
black
silence
then
cavor
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
told
me
he
proposed
to
bind
all
our
luggage
together
with
the
blankets
about
it
against
the
concussion
of
our
descent
we
did
this
with
our
windows
closed
because
in
that
way
our
goods
arranged
themselves
naturally
at
the
centre
of
the
sphere
that
too
was
a
strange
business
we
two
men
floating
loose
in
that
spherical
space
and
packing
and
pulling
ropes
imagine
it
if
you
can
no
up
nor
down
and
every
effort
resulting
in
unexpected
movements
now
i
would
be
pressed
against
the
glass
with
the
full
force
of
thrust
now
i
would
be
kicking
helplessly
in
a
void
now
the
star
of
the
electric
light
would
be
overhead
now
under
foot
now
feet
would
float
up
before
my
eyes
and
now
we
would
be
crossways
to
each
other
but
at
last
our
goods
were
safely
bound
together
in
a
big
soft
bale
all
except
two
blankets
with
head
holes
that
we
were
to
wrap
about
ourselves
then
for
a
flash
cavor
opened
a
window
moonward
and
we
saw
that
we
were
dropping
towards
a
huge
central
crater
with
a
number
of
minor
craters
grouped
in
a
sort
of
cross
about
it
and
then
again
cavor
flung
our
little
sphere
open
to
the
scorching
blinding
sun
i
think
he
was
using
the
attraction
as
a
brake
yourself
with
a
blanket
he
cried
thrusting
himself
from
me
and
for
a
moment
i
did
not
understand
then
i
hauled
the
blanket
from
beneath
my
feet
and
got
it
about
me
and
over
my
head
and
eyes
abruptly
he
closed
the
shutters
again
snapped
one
open
again
and
closed
it
then
suddenly
began
snapping
them
all
open
each
safely
into
its
steel
roller
there
came
a
jar
and
then
we
were
rolling
over
and
over
bumping
against
the
glass
and
against
the
big
bale
of
our
luggage
and
clutching
at
each
other
and
outside
some
white
substance
splashed
as
if
we
were
rolling
down
a
slope
of
snow
over
clutch
bump
clutch
bump
over
came
a
thud
and
i
was
half
buried
under
the
bale
of
our
possessions
and
for
a
space
everything
was
still
then
i
could
hear
cavor
puffing
and
grunting
and
the
snapping
of
a
shutter
in
its
sash
i
made
an
effort
thrust
back
our
luggage
and
emerged
from
beneath
it
our
open
windows
were
just
visible
as
a
deeper
black
set
with
stars
we
were
still
alive
and
we
were
lying
in
the
darkness
of
the
shadow
of
the
wall
of
the
great
crater
into
which
we
had
fallen
we
sat
getting
our
breath
again
and
feeling
the
bruises
on
our
limbs
i
think
either
of
us
had
had
a
very
clear
expectation
of
such
rough
handling
as
we
had
received
i
struggled
painfully
to
my
feet
now
said
i
look
at
the
landscape
of
the
moon
tremendously
dark
cavor
the
glass
was
dewy
and
as
i
spoke
i
wiped
at
it
with
my
blanket
half
an
hour
or
so
beyond
the
day
he
said
must
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
we
might
have
been
in
a
sphere
of
steel
for
all
that
we
could
see
my
rubbing
with
the
blanket
simply
smeared
the
glass
and
as
fast
as
i
wiped
it
it
became
opaque
again
with
freshly
condensed
moisture
mixed
with
an
increasing
quantity
of
blanket
hairs
of
course
i
ought
not
to
have
used
the
blanket
in
my
efforts
to
clear
the
glass
i
slipped
upon
the
damp
surface
and
hurt
my
shin
against
one
of
the
oxygen
cylinders
that
protruded
from
our
bale
the
thing
was
was
absurd
here
we
were
just
arrived
upon
the
moon
amidst
we
knew
not
what
wonders
and
all
we
could
see
was
the
grey
and
streaming
wall
of
the
bubble
in
which
we
had
come
it
i
said
at
this
rate
we
might
have
stopped
at
home
and
i
squatted
on
the
bale
and
shivered
and
drew
my
blanket
closer
about
me
abruptly
the
moisture
turned
to
spangles
and
fronds
of
frost
you
reach
the
electric
heater
said
cavor
black
knob
or
we
shall
i
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
now
said
i
are
we
to
do
he
said
course
we
shall
have
to
wait
until
our
air
gets
warm
again
and
then
this
glass
will
clear
we
do
anything
till
then
night
here
yet
we
must
wait
for
the
day
to
overtake
us
meanwhile
you
feel
hungry
for
a
space
i
did
not
answer
him
but
sat
fretting
i
turned
reluctantly
from
the
smeared
puzzle
of
the
glass
and
stared
at
his
face
i
said
am
hungry
i
feel
somehow
enormously
disappointed
i
had
know
what
i
had
expected
but
not
i
summoned
my
philosophy
and
rearranging
my
blanket
about
me
sat
down
on
the
bale
again
and
began
my
first
meal
on
the
moon
i
think
i
finished
forget
presently
first
in
patches
then
running
rapidly
together
into
wider
spaces
came
the
clearing
of
the
glass
came
the
drawing
of
the
misty
veil
that
hid
the
moon
world
from
our
eyes
we
peered
out
upon
the
landscape
of
the
moon
vii
sunrise
on
the
moon
as
we
saw
it
first
it
was
the
wildest
and
most
desolate
of
scenes
we
were
in
an
enormous
amphitheatre
a
vast
circular
plain
the
floor
of
the
giant
crater
its
walls
closed
us
in
on
every
side
from
the
westward
the
light
of
the
unseen
sun
fell
upon
them
reaching
to
the
very
foot
of
the
cliff
and
showed
a
disordered
escarpment
of
drab
and
greyish
rock
lined
here
and
there
with
banks
and
crevices
of
snow
this
was
perhaps
a
dozen
miles
away
but
at
first
no
intervening
atmosphere
diminished
in
the
slightest
the
minutely
detailed
brilliancy
with
which
these
things
glared
at
us
they
stood
out
clear
and
dazzling
against
a
background
of
starry
blackness
that
seemed
to
our
earthly
eyes
rather
a
gloriously
spangled
velvet
curtain
than
the
spaciousness
of
the
sky
the
eastward
cliff
was
at
first
merely
a
starless
selvedge
to
the
starry
dome
no
rosy
flush
no
creeping
pallor
announced
the
commencing
day
only
the
corona
the
zodiacal
light
a
huge
luminous
haze
pointing
up
towards
the
splendour
of
the
morning
star
warned
us
of
the
imminent
nearness
of
the
sun
whatever
light
was
about
us
was
reflected
by
the
westward
cliffs
it
showed
a
huge
undulating
plain
cold
and
grey
a
grey
that
deepened
eastward
into
the
absolute
raven
darkness
of
the
cliff
shadow
innumerable
rounded
grey
summits
ghostly
hummocks
billows
of
snowy
substance
stretching
crest
beyond
crest
into
the
remote
obscurity
gave
us
our
first
inkling
of
the
distance
of
the
crater
wall
these
hummocks
looked
like
snow
at
the
time
i
thought
they
were
snow
but
they
were
were
mounds
and
masses
of
frozen
air
so
it
was
at
first
and
then
sudden
swift
and
amazing
came
the
lunar
day
the
sunlight
had
crept
down
the
cliff
it
touched
the
drifted
masses
at
its
base
and
incontinently
came
striding
with
boots
towards
us
the
distant
cliff
seemed
to
shift
and
quiver
and
at
the
touch
of
the
dawn
a
reek
of
grey
vapour
poured
upward
from
the
crater
floor
whirls
and
puffs
and
drifting
wraiths
of
grey
thicker
and
broader
and
denser
until
at
last
the
whole
westward
plain
was
steaming
like
a
wet
handkerchief
held
before
the
fire
and
the
westward
cliffs
were
no
more
than
refracted
glare
beyond
is
air
said
cavor
must
be
it
would
not
rise
like
the
mere
touch
of
a
and
at
this
pace
he
peered
upwards
he
said
i
asked
the
sky
already
on
the
little
touch
of
blue
see
the
stars
seem
larger
and
the
little
ones
and
all
those
dim
nebulosities
we
saw
in
empty
are
hidden
swiftly
steadily
the
day
approached
us
grey
summit
after
grey
summit
was
overtaken
by
the
blaze
and
turned
to
a
smoking
white
intensity
at
last
there
was
nothing
to
the
west
of
us
but
a
bank
of
surging
fog
the
tumultuous
advance
and
ascent
of
cloudy
haze
the
distant
cliff
had
receded
farther
and
farther
had
loomed
and
changed
through
the
whirl
and
foundered
and
vanished
at
last
in
its
confusion
nearer
came
that
steaming
advance
nearer
and
nearer
coming
as
fast
as
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
before
the
wind
about
us
rose
a
thin
anticipatory
haze
cavor
gripped
my
arm
i
said
the
sunrise
the
sun
he
turned
me
about
and
pointed
to
the
brow
of
the
eastward
cliff
looming
above
the
haze
about
us
scarce
lighter
than
the
darkness
of
the
sky
but
now
its
line
was
marked
by
strange
reddish
shapes
tongues
of
vermilion
flame
that
writhed
and
danced
i
fancied
it
must
be
spirals
of
vapour
that
had
caught
the
light
and
made
this
crest
of
fiery
tongues
against
the
sky
but
indeed
it
was
the
solar
prominences
i
saw
a
crown
of
fire
about
the
sun
that
is
forever
hidden
from
earthly
eyes
by
our
atmospheric
veil
and
sun
steadily
inevitably
came
a
brilliant
line
came
a
thin
edge
of
intolerable
effulgence
that
took
a
circular
shape
became
a
bow
became
a
blazing
sceptre
and
hurled
a
shaft
of
heat
at
us
as
though
it
was
a
spear
it
seemed
verily
to
stab
my
eyes
i
cried
aloud
and
turned
about
blinded
groping
for
my
blanket
beneath
the
bale
and
with
that
incandescence
came
a
sound
the
first
sound
that
had
reached
us
from
without
since
we
left
the
earth
a
hissing
and
rustling
the
stormy
trailing
of
the
aerial
garment
of
the
advancing
day
and
with
the
coming
of
the
sound
and
the
light
the
sphere
lurched
and
blinded
and
dazzled
we
staggered
helplessly
against
each
other
it
lurched
again
and
the
hissing
grew
louder
i
had
shut
my
eyes
perforce
i
was
making
clumsy
efforts
to
cover
my
head
with
my
blanket
and
this
second
lurch
sent
me
helplessly
off
my
feet
i
fell
against
the
bale
and
opening
my
eyes
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
air
just
outside
our
glass
it
was
was
snow
into
which
a
rod
is
thrust
what
had
been
solid
air
had
suddenly
at
the
touch
of
the
sun
become
a
paste
a
mud
a
slushy
liquefaction
that
hissed
and
bubbled
into
gas
there
came
a
still
more
violent
whirl
of
the
sphere
and
we
had
clutched
one
another
in
another
moment
we
were
spun
about
again
round
we
went
and
over
and
then
i
was
on
all
fours
the
lunar
dawn
had
hold
of
us
it
meant
to
show
us
little
men
what
the
moon
could
do
with
us
i
caught
a
second
glimpse
of
things
without
puffs
of
vapour
half
liquid
slush
excavated
sliding
falling
sliding
we
dropped
into
darkness
i
went
down
with
knees
in
my
chest
then
he
seemed
to
fly
away
from
me
and
for
a
moment
i
lay
with
all
the
breath
out
of
my
body
staring
upward
a
toppling
crag
of
the
melting
stuff
had
splashed
over
us
buried
us
and
now
it
thinned
and
boiled
off
us
i
saw
the
bubbles
dancing
on
the
glass
above
i
heard
cavor
exclaiming
feebly
then
some
huge
landslip
in
the
thawing
air
had
caught
us
and
spluttering
expostulation
we
began
to
roll
down
a
slope
rolling
faster
and
faster
leaping
crevasses
and
rebounding
from
banks
faster
and
faster
westward
into
the
boiling
tumult
of
the
lunar
day
clutching
at
one
another
we
spun
about
pitched
this
way
and
that
our
bale
of
packages
leaping
at
us
pounding
at
us
we
collided
we
gripped
we
were
torn
heads
met
and
the
whole
universe
burst
into
fiery
darts
and
stars
on
the
earth
we
should
have
smashed
one
another
a
dozen
times
but
on
the
moon
luckily
for
us
our
weight
was
only
of
what
it
is
terrestrially
and
we
fell
very
mercifully
i
recall
a
sensation
of
utter
sickness
a
feeling
as
if
my
brain
were
upside
down
within
my
skull
and
something
was
at
work
upon
my
face
some
thin
feelers
worried
my
ears
then
i
discovered
the
brilliance
of
the
landscape
around
was
mitigated
by
blue
spectacles
cavor
bent
over
me
and
i
saw
his
face
upside
down
his
eyes
also
protected
by
tinted
goggles
his
breath
came
irregularly
and
his
lip
was
bleeding
from
a
bruise
he
said
wiping
the
blood
with
the
back
of
his
hand
everything
seemed
swaying
for
a
space
but
that
was
simply
my
giddiness
i
perceived
that
he
had
closed
some
of
the
shutters
in
the
outer
sphere
to
save
the
direct
blaze
of
the
sun
i
was
aware
that
everything
about
us
was
very
brilliant
i
gasped
i
craned
my
neck
to
see
i
perceived
there
was
a
blinding
glare
outside
an
utter
change
from
the
gloomy
darkness
of
our
first
impressions
i
been
insensible
long
i
asked
chronometer
is
broken
some
little
time
my
dear
chap
i
have
been
afraid
i
lay
for
a
space
taking
this
in
i
saw
his
face
still
bore
evidences
of
emotion
for
a
while
i
said
nothing
i
passed
an
inquisitive
hand
over
my
contusions
and
surveyed
his
face
for
similar
damages
the
back
of
my
right
hand
had
suffered
most
and
was
skinless
and
raw
my
forehead
was
bruised
and
had
bled
he
handed
me
a
little
measure
with
some
of
the
forget
the
name
of
had
brought
with
us
after
a
time
i
felt
a
little
better
i
began
to
stretch
my
limbs
carefully
soon
i
could
talk
have
done
i
said
as
though
there
had
been
no
interval
it
he
thought
his
hands
hanging
over
his
knees
he
peered
through
the
glass
and
then
stared
at
me
lord
he
said
has
happened
i
asked
after
a
pause
we
jumped
to
the
tropics
was
as
i
expected
this
air
has
it
is
air
at
any
rate
it
has
evaporated
and
the
surface
of
the
moon
is
showing
we
are
lying
on
a
bank
of
earthy
rock
here
and
there
bare
soil
is
exposed
a
queer
sort
of
soil
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
explain
he
assisted
me
into
a
sitting
position
and
i
could
see
with
my
own
eyes
viii
a
lunar
morning
the
harsh
emphasis
the
pitiless
black
and
white
of
scenery
had
altogether
disappeared
the
glare
of
the
sun
had
taken
upon
itself
a
faint
tinge
of
amber
the
shadows
upon
the
cliff
of
the
crater
wall
were
deeply
purple
to
the
eastward
a
dark
bank
of
fog
still
crouched
and
sheltered
from
the
sunrise
but
to
the
westward
the
sky
was
blue
and
clear
i
began
to
realise
the
length
of
my
insensibility
we
were
no
longer
in
a
void
an
atmosphere
had
arisen
about
us
the
outline
of
things
had
gained
in
character
had
grown
acute
and
varied
save
for
a
shadowed
space
of
white
substance
here
and
there
white
substance
that
was
no
longer
air
but
snow
the
arctic
appearance
had
gone
altogether
everywhere
broad
rusty
brown
spaces
of
bare
and
tumbled
earth
spread
to
the
blaze
of
the
sun
here
and
there
at
the
edge
of
the
snowdrifts
were
transient
little
pools
and
eddies
of
water
the
only
things
stirring
in
that
expanse
of
barrenness
the
sunlight
inundated
the
upper
two
blinds
of
our
sphere
and
turned
our
climate
to
high
summer
but
our
feet
were
still
in
shadow
and
the
sphere
was
lying
upon
a
drift
of
snow
and
scattered
here
and
there
upon
the
slope
and
emphasised
by
little
white
threads
of
unthawed
snow
upon
their
shady
sides
were
shapes
like
sticks
dry
twisted
sticks
of
the
same
rusty
hue
as
the
rock
upon
which
they
lay
that
caught
thoughts
sharply
sticks
on
a
lifeless
world
then
as
my
eye
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
texture
of
their
substance
i
perceived
that
almost
all
this
surface
had
a
fibrous
texture
like
the
carpet
of
brown
needles
one
finds
beneath
the
shade
of
pine
trees
i
said
may
be
a
dead
world
something
arrested
my
attention
i
had
discovered
among
these
needles
a
number
of
little
round
objects
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
of
these
had
moved
i
whispered
but
i
did
not
answer
at
once
i
stared
incredulous
for
an
instant
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
i
gave
an
inarticulate
cry
i
gripped
his
arm
i
pointed
i
cried
finding
my
tongue
yes
and
there
his
eyes
followed
my
pointing
finger
he
said
how
can
i
describe
the
thing
i
saw
it
is
so
petty
a
thing
to
state
and
yet
it
seemed
so
wonderful
so
pregnant
with
emotion
i
have
said
that
amidst
the
litter
were
these
rounded
bodies
these
little
oval
bodies
that
might
have
passed
as
very
small
pebbles
and
now
first
one
and
then
another
had
stirred
had
rolled
over
and
cracked
and
down
the
crack
of
each
of
them
showed
a
minute
line
of
yellowish
green
thrusting
outward
to
meet
the
hot
encouragement
of
the
sun
for
a
moment
that
was
all
and
then
there
stirred
and
burst
a
third
is
a
seed
said
cavor
and
then
i
heard
him
whisper
very
softly
and
immediately
it
poured
upon
us
that
our
vast
journey
had
not
been
made
in
vain
that
we
had
come
to
no
arid
waste
of
minerals
but
to
a
world
that
lived
and
moved
we
watched
intensely
i
remember
i
kept
rubbing
the
glass
before
me
with
my
sleeve
jealous
of
the
faintest
suspicion
of
mist
the
picture
was
clear
and
vivid
only
in
the
middle
of
the
field
all
about
that
centre
the
dead
fibres
and
seeds
were
magnified
and
distorted
by
the
curvature
of
the
glass
but
we
could
see
enough
one
after
another
all
down
the
sunlit
slope
these
miraculous
little
brown
bodies
burst
and
gaped
apart
like
like
the
husks
of
fruits
opened
eager
mouths
that
drank
in
the
heat
and
light
pouring
in
a
cascade
from
the
sun
every
moment
more
of
these
seed
coats
ruptured
and
even
as
they
did
so
the
swelling
pioneers
overflowed
their
and
passed
into
the
second
stage
of
growth
with
a
steady
assurance
a
swift
deliberation
these
amazing
seeds
thrust
a
rootlet
downward
to
the
earth
and
a
queer
little
bud
into
the
air
in
a
little
while
the
whole
slope
was
dotted
with
minute
plantlets
standing
at
attention
in
the
blaze
of
the
sun
they
did
not
stand
for
long
the
buds
swelled
and
strained
and
opened
with
a
jerk
thrusting
out
a
coronet
of
little
sharp
tips
spreading
a
whorl
of
tiny
spiky
brownish
leaves
that
lengthened
rapidly
lengthened
visibly
even
as
we
watched
the
movement
was
slower
than
any
swifter
than
any
i
have
ever
seen
before
how
can
i
suggest
it
to
way
that
growth
went
on
the
leaf
tips
grew
so
that
they
moved
onward
even
while
we
looked
at
them
the
brown
shrivelled
and
was
absorbed
with
an
equal
rapidity
have
you
ever
on
a
cold
day
taken
a
thermometer
into
your
warm
hand
and
watched
the
little
thread
of
mercury
creep
up
the
tube
these
moon
plants
grew
like
that
in
a
few
minutes
as
it
seemed
the
buds
of
the
more
forward
of
these
plants
had
lengthened
into
a
stem
and
were
even
putting
forth
a
second
whorl
of
leaves
and
all
the
slope
that
had
seemed
so
recently
a
lifeless
stretch
of
litter
was
now
dark
with
the
stunted
herbage
of
bristling
spikes
that
swayed
with
the
vigour
of
their
growing
i
turned
about
and
behold
along
the
upper
edge
of
a
rock
to
the
eastward
a
similar
fringe
in
a
scarcely
less
forward
condition
swayed
and
bent
dark
against
the
blinding
glare
of
the
sun
and
beyond
this
fringe
was
the
silhouette
of
a
plant
mass
branching
clumsily
like
a
cactus
and
swelling
visibly
swelling
like
a
bladder
that
fills
with
air
then
to
the
westward
also
i
discovered
that
another
such
distended
form
was
rising
over
the
scrub
but
here
the
light
fell
upon
its
sleek
sides
and
i
could
see
that
its
colour
was
a
vivid
orange
hue
it
rose
as
one
watched
it
if
one
looked
away
from
it
for
a
minute
and
then
back
its
outline
had
changed
it
thrust
out
blunt
congested
branches
until
in
a
little
time
it
rose
a
coralline
shape
of
many
feet
in
height
compared
with
such
a
growth
the
terrestrial
which
will
sometimes
swell
a
foot
in
diameter
in
a
single
night
would
be
a
hopeless
laggard
but
then
the
grows
against
a
gravitational
pull
six
times
that
of
the
moon
beyond
out
of
gullies
and
flats
that
had
been
hidden
from
us
but
not
from
the
quickening
sun
over
reefs
and
banks
of
shining
rock
a
bristling
beard
of
spiky
and
fleshy
vegetation
was
straining
into
view
hurrying
tumultuously
to
take
advantage
of
the
brief
day
in
which
it
must
flower
and
fruit
and
seed
again
and
die
it
was
like
a
miracle
that
growth
so
one
must
imagine
the
trees
and
plants
arose
at
the
creation
and
covered
the
desolation
of
the
earth
imagine
it
imagine
that
dawn
the
resurrection
of
the
frozen
air
the
stirring
and
quickening
of
the
soil
and
then
this
silent
uprising
of
vegetation
this
unearthly
ascent
of
fleshiness
and
spikes
conceive
it
all
lit
by
a
blaze
that
would
make
the
intensest
sunlight
of
earth
seem
watery
and
weak
and
still
around
this
stirring
jungle
wherever
there
was
shadow
lingered
banks
of
bluish
snow
and
to
have
the
picture
of
our
impression
complete
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
we
saw
it
all
through
a
thick
bent
glass
distorting
it
as
things
are
distorted
by
a
lens
acute
only
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
and
very
bright
there
and
towards
the
edges
magnified
and
unreal
ix
prospecting
begins
we
ceased
to
gaze
we
turned
to
each
other
the
same
thought
the
same
question
in
our
eyes
for
these
plants
to
grow
there
must
be
some
air
however
attenuated
air
that
we
also
should
be
able
to
breathe
manhole
i
said
said
cavor
it
is
air
we
see
a
little
while
i
said
plants
will
be
as
high
as
we
are
after
is
it
certain
how
do
you
know
that
stuff
air
it
may
be
may
be
carbonic
acid
even
easy
he
said
and
set
about
proving
it
he
produced
a
big
piece
of
crumpled
paper
from
the
bale
lit
it
and
thrust
it
hastily
through
the
valve
i
bent
forward
and
peered
down
through
the
thick
glass
for
its
appearance
outside
that
little
flame
on
whose
evidence
depended
so
much
i
saw
the
paper
drop
out
and
lie
lightly
upon
the
snow
the
pink
flame
of
its
burning
vanished
for
an
instant
it
seemed
to
be
extinguished
and
then
i
saw
a
little
blue
tongue
upon
the
edge
of
it
that
trembled
and
crept
and
spread
quietly
the
whole
sheet
save
where
it
lay
in
immediate
contact
with
the
snow
charred
and
shrivelled
and
sent
up
a
quivering
thread
of
smoke
there
was
no
doubt
left
to
me
the
atmosphere
of
the
moon
was
either
pure
oxygen
or
air
and
capable
its
tenuity
was
supporting
our
alien
life
we
might
live
i
sat
down
with
my
legs
on
either
side
of
the
manhole
and
prepared
to
unscrew
it
but
cavor
stopped
me
is
first
a
little
precaution
he
said
he
pointed
out
that
although
it
was
certainly
an
oxygenated
atmosphere
outside
it
might
still
be
so
rarefied
as
to
cause
us
grave
injury
he
reminded
me
of
mountain
sickness
and
of
the
bleeding
that
often
afflicts
aeronauts
who
have
ascended
too
swiftly
and
he
spent
some
time
in
the
preparation
of
a
drink
which
he
insisted
on
my
sharing
it
made
me
feel
a
little
numb
but
otherwise
had
no
effect
on
me
then
he
permitted
me
to
begin
unscrewing
presently
the
glass
stopper
of
the
manhole
was
so
far
undone
that
the
denser
air
within
our
sphere
began
to
escape
along
the
thread
of
the
screw
singing
as
a
kettle
sings
before
it
boils
thereupon
he
made
me
desist
it
speedily
became
evident
that
the
pressure
outside
was
very
much
less
than
it
was
within
how
much
less
it
was
we
had
no
means
of
telling
i
sat
grasping
the
stopper
with
both
hands
ready
to
close
it
again
if
in
spite
of
our
intense
hope
the
lunar
atmosphere
should
after
all
prove
too
rarefied
for
us
and
cavor
sat
with
a
cylinder
of
compressed
oxygen
at
hand
to
restore
our
pressure
we
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
and
then
at
the
fantastic
vegetation
that
swayed
and
grew
visibly
and
noiselessly
without
and
ever
that
shrill
piping
continued
my
began
to
throb
in
my
ears
and
the
sound
of
movements
diminished
i
noted
how
still
everything
had
become
because
of
the
thinning
of
the
air
as
our
air
sizzled
out
from
the
screw
the
moisture
of
it
condensed
in
little
puffs
presently
i
experienced
a
peculiar
shortness
of
breath
that
lasted
indeed
during
the
whole
of
the
time
of
our
exposure
to
the
exterior
atmosphere
and
a
rather
unpleasant
sensation
about
the
ears
and
and
the
back
of
the
throat
grew
upon
my
attention
and
presently
passed
off
again
but
then
came
vertigo
and
nausea
that
abruptly
changed
the
quality
of
my
courage
i
gave
the
lid
of
the
manhole
half
a
turn
and
made
a
hasty
explanation
to
cavor
but
now
he
was
the
more
sanguine
he
answered
me
in
a
voice
that
seemed
extraordinarily
small
and
remote
because
of
the
thinness
of
the
air
that
carried
the
sound
he
recommended
a
nip
of
brandy
and
set
me
the
example
and
presently
i
felt
better
i
turned
the
manhole
stopper
back
again
the
throbbing
in
my
ears
grew
louder
and
then
i
remarked
that
the
piping
note
of
the
outrush
had
ceased
for
a
time
i
could
not
be
sure
that
it
had
ceased
said
cavor
in
the
ghost
of
a
voice
said
i
we
go
on
i
thought
this
all
you
can
stand
by
way
of
answer
i
went
on
unscrewing
i
lifted
the
circular
operculum
from
its
place
and
laid
it
carefully
on
the
bale
a
flake
or
so
of
snow
whirled
and
vanished
as
that
thin
and
unfamiliar
air
took
possession
of
our
sphere
i
knelt
and
then
seated
myself
at
the
edge
of
the
manhole
peering
over
it
beneath
within
a
yard
of
my
face
lay
the
untrodden
snow
of
the
moon
there
came
a
little
pause
our
eyes
met
distress
your
lungs
too
much
said
cavor
i
said
can
stand
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
his
blanket
thrust
his
head
through
its
central
hole
and
wrapped
it
about
him
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
manhole
he
let
his
feet
drop
until
they
were
within
six
inches
of
the
lunar
ground
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
thrust
himself
forward
dropped
these
intervening
inches
and
stood
upon
the
untrodden
soil
of
the
moon
as
he
stepped
forward
he
was
refracted
grotesquely
by
the
edge
of
the
glass
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
this
way
and
that
then
he
drew
himself
together
and
leapt
the
glass
distorted
everything
but
it
seemed
to
me
even
then
to
be
an
extremely
big
leap
he
had
at
one
bound
become
remote
he
seemed
twenty
or
thirty
feet
off
he
was
standing
high
upon
a
rocky
mass
and
gesticulating
back
to
me
perhaps
he
was
the
sound
did
not
reach
me
but
how
the
deuce
had
he
done
this
i
felt
like
a
man
who
has
just
seen
a
new
conjuring
trick
in
a
puzzled
state
of
mind
i
too
dropped
through
the
manhole
i
stood
up
just
in
front
of
me
the
snowdrift
had
fallen
away
and
made
a
sort
of
ditch
i
made
a
step
and
jumped
i
found
myself
flying
through
the
air
saw
the
rock
on
which
he
stood
coming
to
meet
me
clutched
it
and
clung
in
a
state
of
infinite
amazement
i
gasped
a
painful
laugh
i
was
tremendously
confused
cavor
bent
down
and
shouted
in
piping
tones
for
me
to
be
careful
i
had
forgotten
that
on
the
moon
with
only
an
eighth
part
of
the
mass
and
a
quarter
of
its
diameter
my
weight
was
barely
a
sixth
what
it
was
on
earth
but
now
that
fact
insisted
on
being
remembered
are
out
of
mother
now
he
said
with
a
guarded
effort
i
raised
myself
to
the
top
and
moving
as
cautiously
as
a
rheumatic
patient
stood
up
beside
him
under
the
blaze
of
the
sun
the
sphere
lay
behind
us
on
its
dwindling
snowdrift
thirty
feet
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
over
the
enormous
disorder
of
rocks
that
formed
the
crater
floor
the
same
bristling
scrub
that
surrounded
us
was
starting
into
life
diversified
here
and
there
by
bulging
masses
of
a
cactus
form
and
scarlet
and
purple
lichens
that
grew
so
fast
they
seemed
to
crawl
over
the
rocks
the
whole
area
of
the
crater
seemed
to
me
then
to
be
one
similar
wilderness
up
to
the
very
foot
of
the
surrounding
cliff
this
cliff
was
apparently
bare
of
vegetation
save
at
its
base
and
with
buttresses
and
terraces
and
platforms
that
did
not
very
greatly
attract
our
attention
at
the
time
it
was
many
miles
away
from
us
in
every
direction
we
seemed
to
be
almost
at
the
centre
of
the
crater
and
we
saw
it
through
a
certain
haziness
that
drove
before
the
wind
for
there
was
even
a
wind
now
in
the
thin
air
a
swift
yet
weak
wind
that
chilled
exceedingly
but
exerted
little
pressure
it
was
blowing
round
the
crater
as
it
seemed
to
the
hot
illuminated
side
from
the
foggy
darkness
under
the
sunward
wall
it
was
difficult
to
look
into
this
eastward
fog
we
had
to
peer
with
eyes
beneath
the
shade
of
our
hands
because
of
the
fierce
intensity
of
the
motionless
sun
seems
to
be
deserted
said
cavor
i
looked
about
me
again
i
retained
even
then
a
clinging
hope
of
some
evidence
some
pinnacle
of
building
some
house
or
engine
but
everywhere
one
looked
spread
the
tumbled
rocks
in
peaks
and
crests
and
the
darting
scrub
and
those
bulging
cacti
that
swelled
and
swelled
a
flat
negation
as
it
seemed
of
all
such
hope
looks
as
though
these
plants
had
it
to
themselves
i
said
see
no
trace
of
any
other
birds
no
not
a
trace
not
a
scrap
nor
particle
of
animal
life
if
there
would
they
do
in
the
night
no
just
these
plants
i
shaded
my
eyes
with
my
hand
like
the
landscape
of
a
dream
these
things
are
less
like
earthly
land
plants
than
the
things
one
imagines
among
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
look
at
that
yonder
one
might
imagine
it
a
lizard
changed
into
a
plant
and
the
glare
is
only
the
fresh
morning
said
cavor
he
sighed
and
looked
about
him
is
no
world
for
men
he
said
yet
in
a
he
became
silent
for
a
time
then
commenced
his
meditative
humming
i
started
at
a
gentle
touch
and
found
a
thin
sheet
of
livid
lichen
lapping
over
my
shoe
i
kicked
at
it
and
it
fell
to
powder
and
each
speck
began
to
grow
i
heard
cavor
exclaim
sharply
and
perceived
that
one
of
the
fixed
bayonets
of
the
scrub
had
pricked
him
he
hesitated
his
eyes
sought
among
the
rocks
about
us
a
sudden
blaze
of
pink
had
crept
up
a
ragged
pillar
of
crag
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
pink
a
livid
magenta
said
i
turning
and
behold
cavor
had
vanished
for
an
instant
i
stood
transfixed
then
i
made
a
hasty
step
to
look
over
the
verge
of
the
rock
but
in
my
surprise
at
his
disappearance
i
forgot
once
more
that
we
were
on
the
moon
the
thrust
of
my
foot
that
i
made
in
striding
would
have
carried
me
a
yard
on
earth
on
the
moon
it
carried
me
good
five
yards
over
the
edge
for
the
moment
the
thing
had
something
of
the
effect
of
those
nightmares
when
one
falls
and
falls
for
while
one
falls
sixteen
feet
in
the
first
second
of
a
fall
on
earth
on
the
moon
one
falls
two
and
with
only
a
sixth
of
weight
i
fell
or
rather
i
jumped
down
about
ten
yards
i
suppose
it
seemed
to
take
quite
a
long
time
five
or
six
seconds
i
should
think
i
floated
through
the
air
and
fell
like
a
feather
in
a
in
the
bottom
of
a
gully
of
rock
i
looked
about
me
i
cried
but
no
cavor
was
visible
i
cried
louder
and
the
rocks
echoed
me
i
turned
fiercely
to
the
rocks
and
clambered
to
the
summit
of
them
i
cried
my
voice
sounded
like
the
voice
of
a
lost
lamb
the
sphere
too
was
not
in
sight
and
for
a
moment
a
horrible
feeling
of
desolation
pinched
my
heart
then
i
saw
him
he
was
laughing
and
gesticulating
to
attract
my
attention
he
was
on
a
bare
patch
of
rock
twenty
or
thirty
yards
away
i
could
not
hear
his
voice
but
said
his
gestures
i
hesitated
the
distance
seemed
enormous
yet
i
reflected
that
surely
i
must
be
able
to
clear
a
greater
distance
than
cavor
i
made
a
step
back
gathered
myself
together
and
leapt
with
all
my
might
i
seemed
to
shoot
right
up
in
the
air
as
though
i
should
never
come
down
it
was
horrible
and
delightful
and
as
wild
as
a
nightmare
to
go
flying
off
in
this
fashion
i
realised
my
leap
had
been
altogether
too
violent
i
flew
clean
over
head
and
beheld
a
spiky
confusion
in
a
gully
spreading
to
meet
my
fall
i
gave
a
yelp
of
alarm
i
put
out
my
hands
and
straightened
my
legs
i
hit
a
huge
fungoid
bulk
that
burst
all
about
me
scattering
a
mass
of
orange
spores
in
every
direction
and
covering
me
with
orange
powder
i
rolled
over
spluttering
and
came
to
rest
convulsed
with
breathless
laughter
i
became
aware
of
little
round
face
peering
over
a
bristling
hedge
he
shouted
some
faded
inquiry
i
tried
to
shout
but
could
not
do
so
for
want
of
breath
he
made
his
way
towards
me
coming
gingerly
among
the
bushes
got
to
be
careful
he
said
moon
has
no
discipline
let
us
smash
he
helped
me
to
my
feet
exerted
yourself
too
much
he
said
dabbing
at
the
yellow
stuff
with
his
hand
to
remove
it
from
my
garments
i
stood
passive
and
panting
allowing
him
to
beat
off
the
jelly
from
my
knees
and
elbows
and
lecture
me
upon
my
misfortunes
quite
allow
for
the
gravitation
our
muscles
are
scarcely
educated
yet
we
must
practise
a
little
when
you
have
got
your
i
pulled
two
or
three
little
thorns
out
of
my
hand
and
sat
for
a
time
on
a
boulder
of
rock
my
muscles
were
quivering
and
i
had
that
feeling
of
personal
disillusionment
that
comes
at
the
first
fall
to
the
learner
of
cycling
on
earth
it
suddenly
occurred
to
cavor
that
the
cold
air
in
the
gully
after
the
brightness
of
the
sun
might
give
me
a
fever
so
we
clambered
back
into
the
sunlight
we
found
that
beyond
a
few
abrasions
i
had
received
no
serious
injuries
from
my
tumble
and
at
suggestion
we
were
presently
looking
round
for
some
safe
and
easy
for
my
next
leap
we
chose
a
rocky
slab
some
ten
yards
off
separated
from
us
by
a
little
thicket
of
spikes
it
there
said
cavor
who
was
assuming
the
airs
of
a
trainer
and
he
pointed
to
a
spot
about
four
feet
from
my
toes
this
leap
i
managed
without
difficulty
and
i
must
confess
i
found
a
certain
satisfaction
in
falling
short
by
a
foot
or
so
and
tasting
the
spikes
of
the
scrub
has
to
be
careful
you
see
he
said
pulling
out
his
thorns
and
with
that
he
ceased
to
be
my
mentor
and
became
my
in
the
art
of
lunar
locomotion
we
chose
a
still
easier
jump
and
did
it
without
difficulty
and
then
leapt
back
again
and
to
and
fro
several
times
accustoming
our
muscles
to
the
new
standard
i
could
never
have
believed
had
i
not
experienced
it
how
rapid
that
adaptation
would
be
in
a
very
little
time
indeed
certainly
after
fewer
than
thirty
leaps
we
could
judge
the
effort
necessary
for
a
distance
with
almost
terrestrial
assurance
and
all
this
time
the
lunar
plants
were
growing
around
us
higher
and
denser
and
more
entangled
every
moment
thicker
and
taller
spiked
plants
green
cactus
masses
fungi
fleshy
and
lichenous
things
strangest
radiate
and
sinuous
shapes
but
we
were
so
intent
upon
our
leaping
that
for
a
time
we
gave
no
heed
to
their
unfaltering
expansion
an
extraordinary
elation
had
taken
possession
of
us
partly
i
think
it
was
our
sense
of
release
from
the
confinement
of
the
sphere
mainly
however
the
thin
sweetness
of
the
air
which
i
am
certain
contained
a
much
larger
proportion
of
oxygen
than
our
terrestrial
atmosphere
in
spite
of
the
strange
quality
of
all
about
us
i
felt
as
adventurous
and
experimental
as
a
cockney
would
do
placed
for
the
first
time
among
mountains
and
i
do
not
think
it
occurred
to
either
of
us
face
to
face
though
we
were
with
the
unknown
to
be
very
greatly
afraid
we
were
bitten
by
a
spirit
of
enterprise
we
selected
a
lichenous
kopje
perhaps
fifteen
yards
away
and
landed
neatly
on
its
summit
one
after
the
other
we
cried
to
each
other
and
cavor
made
three
steps
and
went
off
to
a
tempting
slope
of
snow
a
good
twenty
yards
and
more
beyond
i
stood
for
a
moment
struck
by
the
grotesque
effect
of
his
soaring
dirty
cricket
cap
and
spiky
hair
his
little
round
body
his
arms
and
his
legs
tucked
up
the
weird
spaciousness
of
the
lunar
scene
a
gust
of
laughter
seized
me
and
then
i
stepped
off
to
follow
plump
i
dropped
beside
him
we
made
a
few
gargantuan
strides
leapt
three
or
four
times
more
and
sat
down
at
last
in
a
lichenous
hollow
our
lungs
were
painful
we
sat
holding
our
sides
and
recovering
our
breath
looking
appreciation
to
one
another
cavor
panted
something
about
and
then
came
a
thought
into
my
head
for
the
moment
it
did
not
seem
a
particularly
appalling
thought
simply
a
natural
question
arising
out
of
the
situation
the
way
i
said
exactly
is
the
sphere
cavor
looked
at
me
the
full
meaning
of
what
we
were
saying
struck
me
sharply
i
cried
laying
a
hand
on
his
arm
is
the
sphere
x
lost
men
in
the
moon
his
face
caught
something
of
my
dismay
he
stood
up
and
stared
about
him
at
the
scrub
that
fenced
us
in
and
rose
about
us
straining
upward
in
a
passion
of
growth
he
put
a
dubious
hand
to
his
lips
he
spoke
with
a
sudden
lack
of
assurance
think
he
said
slowly
left
it
somewhere
about
he
pointed
a
hesitating
finger
that
wavered
in
an
arc
not
his
look
of
consternation
deepened
he
said
with
his
eyes
on
me
be
we
had
both
stood
up
we
made
unmeaning
ejaculations
our
eyes
sought
in
the
twining
thickening
jungle
round
about
us
all
about
us
on
the
sunlit
slopes
frothed
and
swayed
the
darting
shrubs
the
swelling
cactus
the
creeping
lichens
and
wherever
the
shade
remained
the
lingered
north
south
east
and
west
spread
an
identical
monotony
of
unfamiliar
forms
and
somewhere
buried
already
among
this
tangled
confusion
was
our
sphere
our
home
our
only
provision
our
only
hope
of
escape
from
this
fantastic
wilderness
of
ephemeral
growths
into
which
we
had
come
think
after
all
he
said
pointing
suddenly
might
be
over
i
said
have
turned
in
a
curve
see
here
is
the
mark
of
my
heels
clear
the
thing
must
be
more
to
the
eastward
much
more
sphere
must
be
over
said
cavor
kept
the
sun
upon
my
right
all
the
leap
it
seems
to
i
said
shadow
flew
before
we
stared
into
one
eyes
the
area
of
the
crater
had
become
enormously
vast
to
our
imaginations
the
growing
thickets
already
impenetrably
dense
heavens
what
fools
we
have
been
evident
that
we
must
find
it
again
said
cavor
that
soon
the
sun
grows
stronger
we
should
be
fainting
with
the
heat
already
if
it
so
dry
and
i
stared
at
him
i
had
not
suspected
this
aspect
of
the
matter
before
but
it
came
to
me
at
positive
craving
i
said
with
emphasis
am
hungry
he
stood
up
with
a
look
of
active
resolution
we
must
find
the
as
calmly
as
possible
we
surveyed
the
interminable
reefs
and
thickets
that
formed
the
floor
of
the
crater
each
of
us
weighing
in
silence
the
chances
of
our
finding
the
sphere
before
we
were
overtaken
by
heat
and
hunger
be
fifty
yards
from
here
said
cavor
with
indecisive
gestures
only
thing
is
to
beat
round
about
until
we
come
upon
is
all
we
can
do
i
said
without
any
alacrity
to
begin
our
hunt
wish
this
confounded
spike
bush
did
not
grow
so
fast
just
it
said
cavor
it
was
lying
on
a
bank
of
i
stared
about
me
in
the
vain
hope
of
recognising
some
knoll
or
shrub
that
had
been
near
the
sphere
but
everywhere
was
a
confusing
sameness
everywhere
the
aspiring
bushes
the
distending
fungi
the
dwindling
snow
banks
steadily
and
inevitably
changed
the
sun
scorched
and
stung
the
faintness
of
an
unaccountable
hunger
mingled
with
our
infinite
perplexity
and
even
as
we
stood
there
confused
and
lost
amidst
unprecedented
things
we
became
aware
for
the
first
time
of
a
sound
upon
the
moon
other
than
the
air
of
the
growing
plants
the
faint
sighing
of
the
wind
or
those
that
we
ourselves
had
made
boom
boom
boom
it
came
from
beneath
our
feet
a
sound
in
the
earth
we
seemed
to
hear
it
with
our
feet
as
much
as
with
our
ears
its
dull
resonance
was
muffled
by
distance
thick
with
the
quality
of
intervening
substance
no
sound
that
i
can
imagine
could
have
astonished
us
more
or
have
changed
more
completely
the
quality
of
things
about
us
for
this
sound
rich
slow
and
deliberate
seemed
to
us
as
though
it
could
be
nothing
but
the
striking
of
some
gigantic
buried
clock
boom
boom
boom
sound
suggestive
of
still
cloisters
of
sleepless
nights
in
crowded
cities
of
vigils
and
the
awaited
hour
of
all
that
is
orderly
and
methodical
in
life
booming
out
pregnant
and
mysterious
in
this
fantastic
desert
to
the
eye
everything
was
unchanged
the
desolation
of
bushes
and
cacti
waving
silently
in
the
wind
stretched
unbroken
to
the
distant
cliffs
the
still
dark
sky
was
empty
overhead
and
the
hot
sun
hung
and
burned
and
through
it
all
a
warning
a
threat
throbbed
this
enigma
of
sound
boom
boom
boom
we
questioned
one
another
in
faint
and
faded
voices
clock
a
clock
is
it
can
it
be
was
belated
suggestion
and
at
that
word
the
striking
ceased
the
silence
the
rhythmic
disappointment
of
the
silence
came
as
a
fresh
shock
for
a
moment
one
could
doubt
whether
one
had
ever
heard
a
sound
or
whether
it
might
not
still
be
going
on
had
i
indeed
heard
a
sound
i
felt
the
pressure
of
hand
upon
my
arm
he
spoke
in
an
undertone
as
though
he
feared
to
wake
some
sleeping
thing
us
keep
together
he
whispered
look
for
the
sphere
we
must
get
back
to
the
sphere
this
is
beyond
our
way
shall
we
go
he
hesitated
an
intense
persuasion
of
presences
of
unseen
things
about
us
and
near
us
dominated
our
minds
what
could
they
be
where
could
they
be
was
this
arid
desolation
alternately
frozen
and
scorched
only
the
outer
rind
and
mask
of
some
subterranean
world
and
if
so
what
sort
of
world
what
sort
of
inhabitants
might
it
not
presently
disgorge
upon
us
and
then
stabbing
the
aching
stillness
as
vivid
and
sudden
as
an
unexpected
thunderclap
came
a
clang
and
rattle
as
though
great
gates
of
metal
had
suddenly
been
flung
apart
it
arrested
our
steps
we
stood
gaping
helplessly
then
cavor
stole
towards
me
do
not
understand
he
whispered
close
to
my
face
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
skyward
the
vague
suggestion
of
still
vaguer
thoughts
if
anything
came
i
looked
about
us
i
nodded
my
head
in
assent
to
him
we
started
off
moving
stealthily
with
the
most
exaggerated
precautions
against
noise
we
went
towards
a
thicket
of
scrub
a
clangour
like
hammers
flung
about
a
boiler
hastened
our
steps
must
crawl
whispered
cavor
the
lower
leaves
of
the
bayonet
plants
already
overshadowed
by
the
newer
ones
above
were
beginning
to
wilt
and
shrivel
so
that
we
could
thrust
our
way
in
among
the
thickening
stems
without
serious
injury
a
stab
in
the
face
or
arm
we
did
not
heed
at
the
heart
of
the
thicket
i
stopped
and
stared
panting
into
face
he
whispered
may
come
must
find
the
sphere
i
said
how
till
we
come
to
if
we
hidden
see
what
they
are
will
keep
together
said
i
he
thought
way
shall
we
go
must
take
our
we
peered
this
way
and
that
then
very
circumspectly
we
began
to
crawl
through
the
lower
jungle
making
so
far
as
we
could
judge
a
circuit
halting
now
at
every
waving
fungus
at
every
sound
intent
only
on
the
sphere
from
which
we
had
so
foolishly
emerged
ever
and
again
from
out
of
the
earth
beneath
us
came
concussions
beatings
strange
inexplicable
mechanical
sounds
and
once
and
then
again
we
thought
we
heard
something
a
faint
rattle
and
tumult
borne
to
us
through
the
air
but
fearful
as
we
were
we
dared
essay
no
to
survey
the
crater
for
long
we
saw
nothing
of
the
beings
whose
sounds
were
so
abundant
and
insistent
but
for
the
faintness
of
our
hunger
and
the
drying
of
our
throats
that
crawling
would
have
had
the
quality
of
a
very
vivid
dream
it
was
so
absolutely
unreal
the
only
element
with
any
touch
of
reality
was
these
sounds
picture
it
to
yourself
about
us
the
jungle
with
the
silent
bayonet
leaves
darting
overhead
and
the
silent
vivid
lichens
under
our
hands
and
knees
waving
with
the
vigour
of
their
growth
as
a
carpet
waves
when
the
wind
gets
beneath
it
ever
and
again
one
of
the
bladder
fungi
bulging
and
distending
under
the
sun
loomed
upon
us
ever
and
again
some
novel
shape
in
vivid
colour
obtruded
the
very
cells
that
built
up
these
plants
were
as
large
as
my
thumb
like
beads
of
coloured
glass
and
all
these
things
were
saturated
in
the
unmitigated
glare
of
the
sun
were
seen
against
a
sky
that
was
bluish
black
and
spangled
still
in
spite
of
the
sunlight
with
a
few
surviving
stars
strange
the
very
forms
and
texture
of
the
stones
were
strange
it
was
all
strange
the
feeling
of
body
was
unprecedented
every
other
movement
ended
in
a
surprise
the
breath
sucked
thin
in
throat
the
blood
flowed
through
ears
in
a
throbbing
thud
thud
thud
and
ever
and
again
came
gusts
of
turmoil
hammering
the
clanging
and
throb
of
machinery
and
bellowing
of
great
beasts
xi
the
mooncalf
pastures
so
we
two
poor
terrestrial
castaways
lost
in
that
moon
jungle
crawled
in
terror
before
the
sounds
that
had
come
upon
us
we
crawled
as
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
we
saw
either
selenite
or
mooncalf
though
we
heard
the
bellowing
and
gruntulous
noises
of
these
latter
continually
drawing
nearer
to
us
we
crawled
through
stony
ravines
over
snow
slopes
amidst
fungi
that
ripped
like
thin
bladders
at
our
thrust
emitting
a
watery
humour
over
a
perfect
pavement
of
things
like
and
beneath
interminable
thickets
of
scrub
and
ever
more
helplessly
our
eyes
sought
for
our
abandoned
sphere
the
noise
of
the
mooncalves
would
at
times
be
a
vast
flat
sound
at
times
it
rose
to
an
amazed
and
wrathy
bellowing
and
again
it
would
become
a
clogged
bestial
sound
as
though
these
unseen
creatures
had
sought
to
eat
and
bellow
at
the
same
time
our
first
view
was
but
an
inadequate
transitory
glimpse
yet
none
the
less
disturbing
because
it
was
incomplete
cavor
was
crawling
in
front
at
the
time
and
he
first
was
aware
of
their
proximity
he
stopped
dead
arresting
me
with
a
single
gesture
a
crackling
and
smashing
of
the
scrub
appeared
to
be
advancing
directly
upon
us
and
then
as
we
squatted
close
and
endeavoured
to
judge
of
the
nearness
and
direction
of
this
noise
there
came
a
terrific
bellow
behind
us
so
close
and
vehement
that
the
tops
of
the
bayonet
scrub
bent
before
it
and
one
felt
the
breath
of
it
hot
and
moist
and
turning
about
we
saw
indistinctly
through
a
crowd
of
swaying
stems
the
shining
sides
and
the
long
line
of
its
back
loomed
out
against
the
sky
of
course
it
is
hard
for
me
now
to
say
how
much
i
saw
at
that
time
because
my
impressions
were
corrected
by
subsequent
observation
first
of
all
impressions
was
its
enormous
size
the
girth
of
its
body
was
some
fourscore
feet
its
length
perhaps
two
hundred
its
sides
rose
and
fell
with
its
laboured
breathing
i
perceived
that
its
gigantic
flabby
body
lay
along
the
ground
and
that
its
skin
was
of
a
corrugated
white
dappling
into
blackness
along
the
backbone
but
of
its
feet
we
saw
nothing
i
think
also
that
we
saw
then
the
profile
at
least
of
the
almost
brainless
head
with
its
neck
its
slobbering
omnivorous
mouth
its
little
nostrils
and
tight
shut
eyes
for
the
mooncalf
invariably
shuts
its
eyes
in
the
presence
of
the
sun
we
had
a
glimpse
of
a
vast
red
pit
as
it
opened
its
mouth
to
bleat
and
bellow
again
we
had
a
breath
from
the
pit
and
then
the
monster
heeled
over
like
a
ship
dragged
forward
along
the
ground
creasing
all
its
leathery
skin
rolled
again
and
so
wallowed
past
us
smashing
a
path
amidst
the
scrub
and
was
speedily
hidden
from
our
eyes
by
the
dense
interlacings
beyond
another
appeared
more
distantly
and
then
another
and
then
as
though
he
was
guiding
these
animated
lumps
of
provender
to
their
pasture
a
selenite
came
momentarily
into
ken
my
grip
upon
foot
became
convulsive
at
the
sight
of
him
and
we
remained
motionless
and
peering
long
after
he
had
passed
out
of
our
range
by
contrast
with
the
mooncalves
he
seemed
a
trivial
being
a
mere
ant
scarcely
five
feet
high
he
was
wearing
garments
of
some
leathery
substance
so
that
no
portion
of
his
actual
body
appeared
but
of
this
of
course
we
were
entirely
ignorant
he
presented
himself
therefore
as
a
compact
bristling
creature
having
much
of
the
quality
of
a
complicated
insect
with
tentacles
and
a
clanging
arm
projecting
from
his
shining
cylindrical
body
case
the
form
of
his
head
was
hidden
by
his
enormous
discovered
afterwards
that
he
used
the
spikes
for
prodding
refractory
a
pair
of
goggles
of
darkened
glass
set
very
much
at
the
side
gave
a
quality
to
the
metallic
apparatus
that
covered
his
face
his
arms
did
not
project
beyond
his
body
case
and
he
carried
himself
upon
short
legs
that
wrapped
though
they
were
in
warm
coverings
seemed
to
our
terrestrial
eyes
inordinately
flimsy
they
had
very
short
thighs
very
long
shanks
and
little
feet
in
spite
of
his
clothing
he
was
progressing
with
what
would
be
from
the
terrestrial
point
of
view
very
considerable
strides
and
his
clanging
arm
was
busy
the
quality
of
his
motion
during
the
instant
of
his
passing
suggested
haste
and
a
certain
anger
and
soon
after
we
had
lost
sight
of
him
we
heard
the
bellow
of
a
mooncalf
change
abruptly
into
a
short
sharp
squeal
followed
by
the
scuffle
of
its
acceleration
and
gradually
that
bellowing
receded
and
then
came
to
an
end
as
if
the
pastures
sought
had
been
attained
we
listened
for
a
space
the
moon
world
was
still
but
it
was
some
time
before
we
resumed
our
crawling
search
for
the
vanished
sphere
when
next
we
saw
mooncalves
they
were
some
little
distance
away
from
us
in
a
place
of
tumbled
rocks
the
less
vertical
surfaces
of
the
rocks
were
thick
with
a
speckled
green
plant
growing
in
dense
mossy
clumps
upon
which
these
creatures
were
browsing
we
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
reeds
amidst
which
we
were
crawling
at
the
sight
of
them
peering
out
at
then
and
looking
round
for
a
second
glimpse
of
a
selenite
they
lay
against
their
food
like
stupendous
slugs
huge
greasy
hulls
eating
greedily
and
noisily
with
a
sort
of
sobbing
avidity
they
seemed
monsters
of
mere
fatness
clumsy
and
overwhelmed
to
a
degree
that
would
make
a
smithfield
ox
seem
a
model
of
agility
their
busy
writhing
chewing
mouths
and
eyes
closed
together
with
the
appetising
sound
of
their
munching
made
up
an
effect
of
animal
enjoyment
that
was
singularly
stimulating
to
our
empty
frames
said
cavor
with
unusual
passion
hogs
and
after
one
glare
of
angry
envy
crawled
off
through
the
bushes
to
our
right
i
stayed
long
enough
to
see
that
the
speckled
plant
was
quite
hopeless
for
human
nourishment
then
crawled
after
him
nibbling
a
quill
of
it
between
my
teeth
presently
we
were
arrested
again
by
the
proximity
of
a
selenite
and
this
time
we
were
able
to
observe
him
more
exactly
now
we
could
see
that
the
selenite
covering
was
indeed
clothing
and
not
a
sort
of
crustacean
integument
he
was
quite
similar
in
his
costume
to
the
former
one
we
had
glimpsed
except
that
ends
of
something
like
wadding
were
protruding
from
his
neck
and
he
stood
on
a
promontory
of
rock
and
moved
his
head
this
way
and
that
as
though
he
was
surveying
the
crater
we
lay
quite
still
fearing
to
attract
his
attention
if
we
moved
and
after
a
time
he
turned
about
and
disappeared
we
came
upon
another
drove
of
mooncalves
bellowing
up
a
ravine
and
then
we
passed
over
a
place
of
sounds
sounds
of
beating
machinery
as
if
some
huge
hall
of
industry
came
near
the
surface
there
and
while
these
sounds
were
still
about
us
we
came
to
the
edge
of
a
great
open
space
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
in
diameter
and
perfectly
level
save
for
a
few
lichens
that
advanced
from
its
margin
this
space
was
bare
and
presented
a
powdery
surface
of
a
dusty
yellow
colour
we
were
afraid
to
strike
out
across
this
space
but
as
it
presented
less
obstruction
to
our
crawling
than
the
scrub
we
went
down
upon
it
and
began
very
circumspectly
to
skirt
its
edge
for
a
little
while
the
noises
from
below
ceased
and
everything
save
for
the
faint
stir
of
the
growing
vegetation
was
very
still
then
abruptly
there
began
an
uproar
louder
more
vehement
and
nearer
than
any
we
had
so
far
heard
of
a
certainty
it
came
from
below
instinctively
we
crouched
as
flat
as
we
could
ready
for
a
prompt
plunge
into
the
thicket
beside
us
each
knock
and
throb
seemed
to
vibrate
through
our
bodies
louder
grew
this
throbbing
and
beating
and
that
irregular
vibration
increased
until
the
whole
moon
world
seemed
to
be
jerking
and
pulsing
whispered
cavor
and
i
turned
towards
the
bushes
at
that
instant
came
a
thud
like
the
thud
of
a
gun
and
then
a
thing
still
haunts
me
in
my
dreams
i
had
turned
my
head
to
look
at
face
and
thrust
out
my
hand
in
front
of
me
as
i
did
so
and
my
hand
met
nothing
i
plunged
suddenly
into
a
bottomless
hole
my
chest
hit
something
hard
and
i
found
myself
with
my
chin
on
the
edge
of
an
unfathomable
abyss
that
had
suddenly
opened
beneath
me
my
hand
extended
stiffly
into
the
void
the
whole
of
that
flat
circular
area
was
no
more
than
a
gigantic
lid
that
was
now
sliding
sideways
from
off
the
pit
it
had
covered
into
a
slot
prepared
for
it
had
it
not
been
for
cavor
i
think
i
should
have
remained
rigid
hanging
over
this
margin
and
staring
into
the
enormous
gulf
below
until
at
last
the
edges
of
the
slot
scraped
me
off
and
hurled
me
into
its
depths
but
cavor
had
not
received
the
shock
that
had
paralysed
me
he
had
been
a
little
distance
from
the
edge
when
the
lid
had
first
opened
and
perceiving
the
peril
that
held
me
helpless
gripped
my
legs
and
pulled
me
backward
i
came
into
a
sitting
position
crawled
away
from
the
edge
for
a
space
on
all
fours
then
staggered
up
and
ran
after
him
across
the
thundering
quivering
sheet
of
metal
it
seemed
to
be
swinging
open
with
a
steadily
accelerated
velocity
and
the
bushes
in
front
of
me
shifted
sideways
as
i
ran
i
was
none
too
soon
back
vanished
amidst
the
bristling
thicket
and
as
i
scrambled
up
after
him
the
monstrous
valve
came
into
its
position
with
a
clang
for
a
long
time
we
lay
panting
not
daring
to
approach
the
pit
but
at
last
very
cautiously
and
bit
by
bit
we
crept
into
a
position
from
which
we
could
peer
down
the
bushes
about
us
creaked
and
waved
with
the
force
of
a
breeze
that
was
blowing
down
the
shaft
we
could
see
nothing
at
first
except
smooth
vertical
walls
descending
at
last
into
an
impenetrable
black
and
then
very
gradually
we
became
aware
of
a
number
of
very
faint
and
little
lights
going
to
and
fro
for
a
time
that
stupendous
gulf
of
mystery
held
us
so
that
we
forgot
even
our
sphere
in
time
as
we
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
we
could
make
out
very
small
dim
elusive
shapes
moving
about
among
those
illuminations
we
peered
amazed
and
incredulous
understanding
so
little
that
we
could
find
no
words
to
say
we
could
distinguish
nothing
that
would
give
us
a
clue
to
the
meaning
of
the
faint
shapes
we
saw
can
it
be
i
asked
can
it
be
engineering
they
must
live
in
these
caverns
during
the
night
and
come
out
during
the
i
said
they
was
something
was
not
a
dare
risk
nothing
dare
do
nothing
until
we
find
the
sphere
do
nothing
until
we
find
the
he
assented
with
a
groan
and
stirred
himself
to
move
he
stared
about
him
for
a
space
sighed
and
indicated
a
direction
we
struck
out
through
the
jungle
for
a
time
we
crawled
resolutely
then
with
diminishing
vigour
presently
among
great
shapes
of
flabby
purple
there
came
a
noise
of
trampling
and
cries
about
us
we
lay
close
and
for
a
long
time
the
sounds
went
to
and
fro
and
very
near
but
this
time
we
saw
nothing
i
tried
to
whisper
to
cavor
that
i
could
hardly
go
without
food
much
longer
but
my
mouth
had
become
too
dry
for
whispering
i
said
must
have
he
turned
a
face
full
of
dismay
towards
me
a
case
for
holding
out
he
said
i
i
said
look
at
my
lips
been
thirsty
some
only
some
of
that
snow
had
remained
clean
gone
driving
from
arctic
to
tropical
at
the
rate
of
a
degree
a
minute
i
gnawed
my
hand
sphere
he
said
is
nothing
for
it
but
the
we
roused
ourselves
to
another
spurt
of
crawling
my
mind
ran
entirely
on
edible
things
on
the
hissing
profundity
of
summer
drinks
more
particularly
i
craved
for
beer
i
was
haunted
by
the
memory
of
a
sixteen
gallon
cask
that
had
swaggered
in
my
lympne
cellar
i
thought
of
the
adjacent
larder
and
especially
of
steak
and
kidney
steak
and
plenty
of
kidney
and
rich
thick
gravy
between
ever
and
again
i
was
seized
with
fits
of
hungry
yawning
we
came
to
flat
places
overgrown
with
fleshy
red
things
monstrous
coralline
growths
as
we
pushed
against
them
they
snapped
and
broke
i
noted
the
quality
of
the
broken
surfaces
the
confounded
stuff
certainly
looked
of
a
biteable
texture
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
smelt
rather
well
i
picked
up
a
fragment
and
sniffed
at
it
i
said
in
a
hoarse
undertone
he
glanced
at
me
with
his
face
screwed
up
he
said
i
put
down
the
fragment
and
we
crawled
on
through
this
tempting
fleshiness
for
a
space
i
asked
i
heard
him
say
but
he
did
not
look
round
we
crawled
some
way
before
i
decided
chance
it
said
i
he
made
a
belated
gesture
to
prevent
me
i
stuffed
my
mouth
full
he
crouched
watching
my
face
his
own
twisted
into
the
oddest
expression
good
i
said
lord
he
cried
he
watched
me
munch
his
face
wrinkled
between
desire
and
disapproval
then
suddenly
succumbed
to
appetite
and
began
to
tear
off
huge
mouthfuls
for
a
time
we
did
nothing
but
eat
the
stuff
was
not
unlike
a
terrestrial
mushroom
only
it
was
much
laxer
in
texture
and
as
one
swallowed
it
it
warmed
the
throat
at
first
we
experienced
a
mere
mechanical
satisfaction
in
eating
then
our
blood
began
to
run
warmer
and
we
tingled
at
the
lips
and
fingers
and
then
new
and
slightly
irrelevant
ideas
came
bubbling
up
in
our
minds
good
said
i
good
what
a
home
for
our
surplus
population
our
poor
surplus
population
and
i
broke
off
another
large
portion
it
filled
me
with
a
curiously
benevolent
satisfaction
that
there
was
such
good
food
in
the
moon
the
depression
of
my
hunger
gave
way
to
an
irrational
exhilaration
the
dread
and
discomfort
in
which
i
had
been
living
vanished
entirely
i
perceived
the
moon
no
longer
as
a
planet
from
which
i
most
earnestly
desired
the
means
of
escape
but
as
a
possible
refuge
from
human
destitution
i
think
i
forgot
the
selenites
the
mooncalves
the
lid
and
the
noises
completely
so
soon
as
i
had
eaten
that
fungus
cavor
replied
to
my
third
repetition
of
my
remark
with
similar
words
of
approval
i
felt
that
my
head
swam
but
i
put
this
down
to
the
stimulating
effect
of
food
after
a
long
fast
yours
cavor
said
i
to
the
mean
asked
cavor
of
the
to
the
tato
i
looked
at
him
shocked
at
his
suddenly
hoarse
voice
and
by
the
badness
of
his
articulation
it
occurred
to
me
in
a
flash
that
he
was
intoxicated
possibly
by
the
fungus
it
also
occurred
to
me
that
he
erred
in
imagining
that
he
had
discovered
the
moon
he
had
not
discovered
it
he
had
only
reached
it
i
tried
to
lay
my
hand
on
his
arm
and
explain
this
to
him
but
the
issue
was
too
subtle
for
his
brain
it
was
also
unexpectedly
difficult
to
express
after
a
momentary
attempt
to
understand
remember
wondering
if
the
fungus
had
made
my
eyes
as
fishy
as
set
off
upon
some
observations
on
his
own
account
are
he
announced
with
a
solemn
hiccup
creashurs
what
we
eat
and
he
repeated
this
and
as
i
was
now
in
one
of
my
subtle
moods
i
determined
to
dispute
it
possibly
i
wandered
a
little
from
the
point
but
cavor
certainly
did
not
attend
at
all
properly
he
stood
up
as
well
as
he
could
putting
a
hand
on
my
head
to
steady
himself
which
was
disrespectful
and
stood
staring
about
him
quite
devoid
now
of
any
fear
of
the
moon
beings
i
tried
to
point
out
that
this
was
dangerous
for
some
reason
that
was
not
perfectly
clear
to
me
but
the
word
had
somehow
got
mixed
with
and
came
out
rather
more
like
than
either
and
after
an
attempt
to
disentangle
them
i
resumed
my
argument
addressing
myself
principally
to
the
unfamiliar
but
attentive
coralline
growths
on
either
side
i
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
clear
up
this
confusion
between
the
moon
and
a
potato
at
wandered
into
a
long
parenthesis
on
the
importance
of
precision
of
definition
in
argument
i
did
my
best
to
ignore
the
fact
that
my
bodily
sensations
were
no
longer
agreeable
in
some
way
that
i
have
now
forgotten
my
mind
was
led
back
to
projects
of
colonisation
must
annex
this
moon
i
said
must
be
no
this
is
part
of
the
white
burthen
satraps
nempire
c√¶sar
never
dreamt
all
the
newspapers
cavorecia
bedfordecia
certainly
i
was
intoxicated
i
embarked
upon
an
argument
to
show
the
infinite
benefits
our
arrival
would
confer
on
the
moon
i
involved
myself
in
a
rather
difficult
proof
that
the
arrival
of
columbus
was
on
the
whole
beneficial
to
america
i
found
i
had
forgotten
the
line
of
argument
i
had
intended
to
pursue
and
continued
to
repeat
to
to
fill
up
time
from
that
point
my
memory
of
the
action
of
that
abominable
fungus
becomes
confused
i
remember
vaguely
that
we
declared
our
intention
of
standing
no
nonsense
from
any
confounded
insects
that
we
decided
it
ill
became
men
to
hide
shamefully
upon
a
mere
satellite
that
we
equipped
ourselves
with
huge
armfuls
of
the
for
missile
purposes
or
not
i
do
not
heedless
of
the
stabs
of
the
bayonet
scrub
we
started
forth
into
the
sunshine
almost
immediately
we
must
have
come
upon
the
selenites
there
were
six
of
them
and
they
were
marching
in
single
file
over
a
rocky
place
making
the
most
remarkable
piping
and
whining
sounds
they
all
seemed
to
become
aware
of
us
at
once
all
instantly
became
silent
and
motionless
like
animals
with
their
faces
turned
towards
us
for
a
moment
i
was
sobered
murmured
cavor
and
they
think
going
to
crawl
about
on
my
my
vertebrated
stomach
he
repeated
slowly
as
though
he
chewed
the
indignity
then
suddenly
with
a
sort
of
fury
he
made
three
vast
strides
and
leapt
towards
them
he
leapt
badly
he
made
a
series
of
somersaults
in
the
air
whirled
right
over
them
and
vanished
with
an
enormous
splash
amidst
the
cactus
bladders
what
the
selenites
made
of
this
amazing
and
to
my
mind
undignified
irruption
from
another
planet
i
have
no
means
of
guessing
i
seem
to
remember
the
sight
of
their
backs
as
they
ran
in
all
directions
but
i
am
not
sure
all
these
last
incidents
before
oblivion
came
are
vague
and
faint
in
my
mind
i
know
i
made
a
step
to
follow
cavor
and
tripped
and
fell
headlong
among
the
rocks
i
was
i
am
certain
suddenly
and
vehemently
ill
i
seem
to
remember
a
violent
struggle
and
being
gripped
by
metallic
clasps
my
next
clear
recollection
is
that
we
were
prisoners
at
we
knew
not
what
depths
beneath
the
surface
we
were
in
darkness
amidst
strange
distracting
noises
our
bodies
were
covered
with
scratches
and
bruises
and
our
heads
racked
with
pain
xii
the
face
i
found
myself
sitting
crouched
together
in
a
tumultuous
darkness
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
understand
where
i
was
nor
how
i
had
come
to
this
perplexity
i
thought
of
the
cupboard
into
which
i
had
been
thrust
at
times
when
i
was
a
child
and
then
of
a
very
dark
and
noisy
bedroom
in
which
i
had
slept
during
an
illness
but
these
sounds
about
me
were
not
the
noises
i
had
known
and
there
was
a
thin
flavour
in
the
air
like
the
wind
of
a
stable
then
i
supposed
we
must
still
be
at
work
upon
the
sphere
and
that
somehow
i
had
got
into
the
cellar
of
house
i
remembered
we
had
finished
the
sphere
and
fancied
i
must
still
be
in
it
and
travelling
through
space
i
said
can
not
we
have
some
light
there
came
no
answer
i
insisted
i
was
answered
by
a
groan
head
i
heard
him
say
head
i
attempted
to
press
my
hands
to
my
brow
which
ached
and
discovered
they
were
tied
together
this
startled
me
very
much
i
brought
them
up
to
my
mouth
and
felt
the
cold
smoothness
of
metal
they
were
chained
together
i
tried
to
separate
my
legs
and
made
out
they
were
similarly
fastened
and
also
that
i
was
fastened
to
the
ground
by
a
much
thicker
chain
about
the
middle
of
my
body
i
was
more
frightened
than
i
had
yet
been
by
anything
in
all
our
strange
experiences
for
a
time
i
tugged
silently
at
my
bonds
i
cried
out
sharply
am
i
tied
why
have
you
tied
me
hand
and
foot
tied
you
he
answered
the
the
selenites
my
mind
hung
on
that
for
a
space
then
my
memories
came
back
to
me
the
snowy
desolation
the
thawing
of
the
air
the
growth
of
the
plants
our
strange
hopping
and
crawling
among
the
rocks
and
vegetation
of
the
crater
all
the
distress
of
our
frantic
search
for
the
sphere
returned
to
me
finally
the
opening
of
the
great
lid
that
covered
the
pit
then
as
i
strained
to
trace
our
later
movements
down
to
our
present
plight
the
pain
in
my
head
became
intolerable
i
came
to
an
insurmountable
barrier
an
obstinate
blank
are
we
should
i
know
we
dead
nonsense
got
us
then
he
made
no
answer
but
a
grunt
the
lingering
traces
of
the
poison
seemed
to
make
him
oddly
irritable
do
you
mean
to
do
should
i
know
what
to
do
very
well
said
i
and
became
silent
presently
i
was
roused
from
a
stupor
i
cried
wish
stop
that
buzzing
we
lapsed
into
silence
again
listening
to
the
dull
confusion
of
noises
like
the
muffled
sounds
of
a
street
or
factory
that
filled
our
ears
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
my
mind
pursued
first
one
rhythm
and
then
another
and
questioned
it
in
vain
but
after
a
long
time
i
became
aware
of
a
new
and
sharper
element
not
mingling
with
the
rest
but
standing
out
as
it
were
against
that
cloudy
background
of
sound
it
was
a
series
of
relatively
very
little
definite
sounds
tappings
and
rubbings
like
a
loose
spray
of
ivy
against
a
window
or
a
bird
moving
about
upon
a
box
we
listened
and
peered
about
us
but
the
darkness
was
a
velvet
pall
there
followed
a
noise
like
the
subtle
movement
of
the
wards
of
a
lock
and
then
there
appeared
before
me
hanging
as
it
seemed
in
an
immensity
of
black
a
thin
bright
line
whispered
cavor
very
softly
is
it
we
stared
the
thin
bright
line
became
a
band
and
broader
and
paler
it
took
upon
itself
the
quality
of
a
bluish
light
falling
upon
a
wall
it
ceased
to
be
it
developed
a
deep
indentation
on
one
side
i
turned
to
remark
this
to
cavor
and
was
amazed
to
see
his
ear
in
a
brilliant
the
rest
of
him
in
shadow
i
twisted
my
head
round
as
well
as
my
bonds
would
permit
i
said
behind
his
ear
place
to
an
eye
suddenly
the
crack
that
had
been
admitting
the
light
broadened
out
and
revealed
itself
as
the
space
of
an
opening
door
beyond
was
a
sapphire
vista
and
in
the
doorway
stood
a
grotesque
outline
silhouetted
against
the
glare
we
both
made
convulsive
efforts
to
turn
and
failing
sat
staring
over
our
shoulders
at
this
my
first
impression
was
of
some
clumsy
quadruped
with
lowered
head
then
i
perceived
it
was
the
slender
pinched
body
and
short
and
extremely
attenuated
bandy
legs
of
a
selenite
with
his
head
depressed
between
his
shoulders
he
was
without
the
helmet
and
body
covering
they
wear
upon
the
exterior
he
was
a
blank
black
figure
to
us
but
instinctively
our
imaginations
supplied
features
to
his
very
human
outline
i
at
least
took
it
instantly
that
he
was
somewhat
hunchbacked
with
a
high
forehead
and
long
features
he
came
forward
three
steps
and
paused
for
a
time
his
movements
seemed
absolutely
noiseless
then
he
came
forward
again
he
walked
like
a
bird
his
feet
fell
one
in
front
of
the
other
he
stepped
out
of
the
ray
of
light
that
came
through
the
doorway
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
vanished
altogether
in
the
shadow
for
a
moment
my
eyes
sought
him
in
the
wrong
place
and
then
i
perceived
him
standing
facing
us
both
in
the
full
light
only
the
human
features
i
had
attributed
to
him
were
not
there
at
all
of
course
i
ought
to
have
expected
that
only
i
it
came
to
me
as
an
absolute
for
a
moment
an
overwhelming
shock
it
seemed
as
though
it
a
face
as
though
it
must
needs
be
a
mask
a
horror
a
deformity
that
would
presently
be
disavowed
or
explained
there
was
no
nose
and
the
thing
had
dull
bulging
eyes
at
the
the
silhouette
i
had
supposed
they
were
ears
there
were
no
ears
i
have
tried
to
draw
one
of
these
heads
but
i
can
not
there
was
a
mouth
downwardly
curved
like
a
human
mouth
in
a
face
that
stares
ferociously
the
neck
on
which
the
head
was
poised
was
jointed
in
three
places
almost
like
the
short
joints
in
the
leg
of
a
crab
the
joints
of
the
limbs
i
could
not
see
because
of
the
straps
in
which
they
were
swathed
and
which
formed
the
only
clothing
the
being
wore
there
the
thing
was
looking
at
us
at
the
time
my
mind
was
taken
up
by
the
mad
impossibility
of
the
creature
i
suppose
he
also
was
amazed
and
with
more
reason
perhaps
for
amazement
than
we
only
confound
him
he
did
not
show
it
we
did
at
least
know
what
had
brought
about
this
meeting
of
incompatible
creatures
but
conceive
how
it
would
seem
to
decent
londoners
for
example
to
come
upon
a
couple
of
living
things
as
big
as
men
and
absolutely
unlike
any
other
earthly
animals
careering
about
among
the
sheep
in
hyde
park
it
must
have
taken
him
like
that
figure
us
we
were
bound
hand
and
foot
fagged
and
filthy
our
beards
two
inches
long
our
faces
scratched
and
bloody
cavor
you
must
imagine
in
his
knickerbockers
torn
in
several
places
by
the
bayonet
scrub
his
jaegar
shirt
and
old
cricket
cap
his
wiry
hair
wildly
disordered
a
tail
to
every
quarter
of
the
heavens
in
that
blue
light
his
face
did
not
look
red
but
very
dark
his
lips
and
the
drying
blood
upon
my
hands
seemed
black
if
possible
i
was
in
a
worse
plight
than
he
on
account
of
the
yellow
fungus
into
which
i
had
jumped
our
jackets
were
unbuttoned
and
our
shoes
had
been
taken
off
and
lay
at
our
feet
and
we
were
sitting
with
our
backs
to
this
queer
bluish
light
peering
at
such
a
monster
as
durer
might
have
invented
cavor
broke
the
silence
started
to
speak
went
hoarse
and
cleared
his
throat
outside
began
a
terrific
bellowing
as
if
a
mooncalf
were
in
trouble
it
ended
in
a
shriek
and
everything
was
still
again
presently
the
selenite
turned
about
flickered
into
the
shadow
stood
for
a
moment
retrospective
at
the
door
and
then
closed
it
on
us
and
once
more
we
were
in
that
murmurous
mystery
of
darkness
into
which
we
had
awakened
xiii
cavor
makes
some
suggestions
for
a
time
neither
of
us
spoke
to
focus
together
all
the
things
we
had
brought
upon
ourselves
seemed
beyond
my
mental
powers
got
us
i
said
at
last
was
that
i
taken
it
we
should
have
fainted
and
might
have
found
the
i
lost
my
temper
at
his
persistence
and
swore
to
myself
for
a
time
we
hated
one
another
in
silence
i
drummed
with
my
fingers
on
the
floor
between
my
knees
and
gritted
the
links
of
my
fetters
together
presently
i
was
forced
to
talk
again
do
you
make
of
it
anyhow
i
asked
humbly
are
reasonable
can
make
things
and
do
things
those
lights
we
saw
he
stopped
it
was
clear
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
to
confess
all
they
are
more
human
than
we
had
a
right
to
expect
i
he
stopped
irritatingly
suppose
any
planet
where
there
is
an
intelligent
will
carry
its
brain
case
upward
and
have
hands
and
walk
presently
he
broke
away
in
another
direction
are
some
way
in
he
said
a
couple
of
thousand
feet
or
cooler
and
our
voices
are
so
much
louder
that
faded
has
altogether
gone
and
the
feeling
in
ears
and
i
had
not
noted
that
but
i
did
now
air
is
denser
we
must
be
some
mile
even
we
may
the
never
thought
of
a
world
inside
the
could
we
might
have
done
only
one
gets
into
habits
of
he
thought
for
a
time
he
said
seems
such
an
obvious
course
the
moon
must
be
enormously
cavernous
with
an
atmosphere
within
and
at
the
centre
of
its
caverns
a
sea
knew
that
the
moon
had
a
lower
specific
gravity
than
the
earth
one
knew
that
it
had
little
air
or
water
outside
one
knew
too
that
it
was
sister
planet
to
the
earth
and
that
it
was
unaccountable
that
it
should
be
different
in
composition
the
inference
that
it
was
hollowed
out
was
as
clear
as
day
and
yet
one
never
saw
it
as
a
fact
kepler
of
his
voice
had
the
interest
now
of
a
man
who
has
discerned
a
pretty
sequence
of
reasoning
he
said
with
his
was
right
after
wish
you
had
taken
the
trouble
to
find
that
out
before
we
came
i
said
he
answered
nothing
buzzing
to
himself
softly
as
he
pursued
his
thoughts
my
temper
was
going
do
you
think
has
become
of
the
sphere
anyhow
i
asked
he
said
like
a
man
who
answers
an
uninteresting
question
those
plants
they
find
then
can
i
tell
i
said
with
a
sort
of
hysterical
bitterness
look
bright
for
my
company
he
made
no
answer
lord
i
exclaimed
think
of
all
the
trouble
we
took
to
get
into
this
pickle
what
did
we
come
for
what
are
we
after
what
was
the
moon
to
us
or
we
to
the
moon
we
wanted
too
much
we
tried
too
much
we
ought
to
have
started
the
little
things
first
it
was
you
proposed
the
moon
those
cavorite
spring
blinds
i
am
certain
we
could
have
worked
them
for
terrestrial
purposes
certain
did
you
really
understand
what
i
proposed
a
steel
said
cavor
we
ceased
to
converse
for
a
time
cavor
kept
up
a
broken
monologue
without
much
help
from
me
they
find
it
he
began
they
find
it
what
will
they
do
with
it
well
a
question
it
may
be
question
they
understand
it
anyhow
if
they
understood
that
sort
of
thing
they
would
have
come
long
since
to
the
earth
would
they
why
they
but
they
would
have
sent
keep
their
hands
off
such
a
possibility
no
but
they
will
examine
it
clearly
they
are
intelligent
and
inquisitive
they
will
examine
inside
with
the
studs
off
that
would
mean
the
moon
for
us
for
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
strange
creatures
strange
knowledge
for
strange
said
i
and
language
failed
me
here
bedford
said
cavor
came
on
this
expedition
of
your
own
free
said
to
me
it
always
risks
in
when
you
do
it
unarmed
and
without
thinking
out
every
was
so
taken
up
with
the
sphere
the
thing
rushed
on
us
and
carried
us
on
you
on
me
just
as
much
how
was
i
to
know
when
i
set
to
work
on
molecular
physics
that
the
business
would
bring
me
all
places
this
accursed
science
i
cried
the
very
devil
the
medi√¶val
priests
and
persecutors
were
right
and
the
moderns
are
all
wrong
you
tamper
with
it
offers
you
gifts
and
directly
you
take
them
it
knocks
you
to
pieces
in
some
unexpected
way
old
passions
and
new
it
upsets
your
religion
now
it
upsets
your
social
ideas
now
it
whirls
you
off
to
desolation
and
misery
no
use
your
quarrelling
with
me
these
selenites
or
whatever
we
choose
to
call
got
us
tied
hand
and
foot
whatever
temper
you
choose
to
go
through
with
it
in
you
will
have
to
go
through
with
it
we
have
experiences
before
us
that
will
need
all
our
he
paused
as
if
he
required
my
assent
but
i
sat
sulking
your
science
i
said
problem
is
communication
gestures
i
fear
will
be
different
pointing
for
example
no
creatures
but
men
and
monkeys
that
was
too
obviously
wrong
for
me
nearly
every
animal
i
cried
with
its
eyes
or
cavor
meditated
over
that
he
said
at
last
we
such
differences
might
but
how
can
i
tell
there
is
speech
the
sounds
they
make
a
sort
of
fluting
and
piping
i
see
how
we
are
to
imitate
that
is
it
their
speech
that
sort
of
thing
they
may
have
different
senses
different
means
of
communication
of
course
they
are
minds
and
we
are
minds
there
must
be
something
in
common
who
knows
how
far
we
may
not
get
to
an
understanding
things
are
outside
us
i
said
more
different
from
us
than
the
strangest
animals
on
earth
they
are
a
different
clay
what
is
the
good
of
talking
like
this
cavor
thought
see
that
where
there
are
minds
they
will
have
something
though
they
have
been
evolved
on
different
planets
of
course
if
it
was
a
question
of
instincts
if
we
or
they
are
no
more
than
they
much
more
like
ants
on
their
hind
legs
than
human
beings
and
who
ever
got
to
any
sort
of
understanding
with
ants
these
machines
and
clothing
no
i
hold
with
you
bedford
the
difference
is
resemblance
must
bridge
it
i
remember
reading
once
a
paper
by
the
late
professor
galton
on
the
possibility
of
communication
between
the
planets
unhappily
at
that
time
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
that
would
be
of
any
material
benefit
to
me
and
i
fear
i
did
not
give
it
the
attention
i
should
have
view
of
this
state
of
affairs
yet
now
let
me
see
idea
was
to
begin
with
those
broad
truths
that
must
underlie
all
conceivable
mental
existences
and
establish
a
basis
on
those
the
great
principles
of
geometry
to
begin
with
he
proposed
to
take
some
leading
proposition
of
and
show
by
construction
that
its
truth
was
known
to
us
to
demonstrate
for
example
that
the
angles
at
the
base
of
an
isosceles
triangle
are
equal
and
that
if
the
equal
sides
be
produced
the
angles
on
the
other
side
of
the
base
are
equal
also
or
that
the
square
on
the
hypotenuse
of
a
triangle
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
squares
on
the
two
other
sides
by
demonstrating
our
knowledge
of
these
things
we
should
demonstrate
our
possession
of
a
reasonable
intelligence
now
suppose
i
i
might
draw
the
geometrical
figure
with
a
wet
finger
or
even
trace
it
in
the
air
he
fell
silent
i
sat
meditating
his
words
for
a
time
his
wild
hope
of
communication
of
interpretation
with
these
weird
beings
held
me
then
that
angry
despair
that
was
a
part
of
my
exhaustion
and
physical
misery
resumed
its
sway
i
perceived
with
a
sudden
novel
vividness
the
extraordinary
folly
of
everything
i
had
ever
done
i
said
ass
unutterable
ass
i
seem
to
exist
only
to
go
about
doing
preposterous
things
why
did
we
ever
leave
the
thing
hopping
about
looking
for
patents
and
concessions
in
the
craters
of
the
moon
if
only
we
had
had
the
sense
to
fasten
a
handkerchief
to
a
stick
to
show
where
we
had
left
the
sphere
i
subsided
fuming
is
clear
meditated
cavor
are
intelligent
one
can
hypothecate
certain
things
as
they
have
not
killed
us
at
once
they
must
have
ideas
of
mercy
mercy
at
any
rate
of
restraint
possibly
of
intercourse
they
may
meet
us
and
this
apartment
and
the
glimpses
we
had
of
its
guardian
these
fetters
a
high
degree
of
intelligence
wish
to
heaven
cried
i
thought
even
twice
plunge
after
plunge
first
one
fluky
start
and
then
another
it
was
my
confidence
in
you
i
stick
to
my
play
that
was
what
i
was
equal
to
that
was
my
world
and
the
life
i
was
made
for
i
could
have
finished
that
play
certain
it
was
a
good
play
i
had
the
scenario
as
good
as
done
then
conceive
it
leaping
to
the
moon
thrown
my
life
away
that
old
woman
in
the
inn
near
canterbury
had
better
i
looked
up
and
stopped
in
the
darkness
had
given
place
to
that
bluish
light
again
the
door
was
opening
and
several
noiseless
selenites
were
coming
into
the
chamber
i
became
quite
still
staring
at
their
grotesque
faces
then
suddenly
my
sense
of
disagreeable
strangeness
changed
to
interest
i
perceived
that
the
foremost
and
second
carried
bowls
one
elemental
need
at
least
our
minds
could
understand
in
common
they
were
bowls
of
some
metal
that
like
our
fetters
looked
dark
in
that
bluish
light
and
each
contained
a
number
of
whitish
fragments
all
the
cloudy
pain
and
misery
that
oppressed
me
rushed
together
and
took
the
shape
of
hunger
i
eyed
these
bowls
wolfishly
and
though
it
returned
to
me
in
dreams
at
that
time
it
seemed
a
small
matter
that
at
the
end
of
the
arms
that
lowered
one
towards
me
were
not
hands
but
a
sort
of
flap
and
thumb
like
the
end
of
an
trunk
the
stuff
in
the
bowl
was
loose
in
texture
and
whitish
brown
in
like
lumps
of
some
cold
souffle
and
it
smelt
faintly
like
mushrooms
from
a
partially
divided
carcass
of
a
mooncalf
that
we
presently
saw
i
am
inclined
to
believe
it
must
have
been
mooncalf
flesh
my
hands
were
so
tightly
chained
that
i
could
barely
contrive
to
reach
the
bowl
but
when
they
saw
the
effort
i
made
two
of
them
dexterously
released
one
of
the
turns
about
my
wrist
their
tentacle
hands
were
soft
and
cold
to
my
skin
i
immediately
seized
a
mouthful
of
the
food
it
had
the
same
laxness
in
texture
that
all
organic
structures
seem
to
have
upon
the
moon
it
tasted
rather
like
a
gauffre
or
a
damp
meringue
but
in
no
way
was
it
disagreeable
i
took
two
other
mouthfuls
said
i
tearing
off
a
still
larger
piece
for
a
time
we
ate
with
an
utter
absence
of
we
ate
and
presently
drank
like
tramps
in
a
soup
kitchen
never
before
nor
since
have
i
been
hungry
to
the
ravenous
pitch
and
save
that
i
have
had
this
very
experience
i
could
never
have
believed
that
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
miles
out
of
our
proper
world
in
utter
perplexity
of
soul
surrounded
watched
touched
by
beings
more
grotesque
and
inhuman
than
the
worst
creations
of
a
nightmare
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
eat
in
utter
forgetfulness
of
all
these
things
they
stood
about
us
watching
us
and
ever
and
again
making
a
slight
elusive
twittering
that
stood
i
suppose
in
the
stead
of
speech
i
did
not
even
shiver
at
their
touch
and
when
the
first
zeal
of
my
feeding
was
over
i
could
note
that
cavor
too
had
been
eating
with
the
same
shameless
abandon
xiv
experiments
in
intercourse
when
at
last
we
had
made
an
end
of
eating
the
selenites
linked
our
hands
closely
together
again
and
then
untwisted
the
chains
about
our
feet
and
rebound
them
so
as
to
give
us
a
limited
freedom
of
movement
then
they
unfastened
the
chains
about
our
waists
to
do
all
this
they
had
to
handle
us
freely
and
ever
and
again
one
of
their
queer
heads
came
down
close
to
my
face
or
a
soft
touched
my
head
or
neck
i
remember
that
i
was
afraid
then
or
repelled
by
their
proximity
i
think
that
our
incurable
anthropomorphism
made
us
imagine
there
were
human
heads
inside
their
masks
the
skin
like
everything
else
looked
bluish
but
that
was
on
account
of
the
light
and
it
was
hard
and
shiny
quite
in
the
fashion
not
soft
or
moist
or
hairy
as
a
vertebrated
would
be
along
the
crest
of
the
head
was
a
low
ridge
of
whitish
spines
running
from
back
to
front
and
a
much
larger
ridge
curved
on
either
side
over
the
eyes
the
selenite
who
untied
me
used
his
mouth
to
help
his
hands
seem
to
be
releasing
us
said
cavor
we
are
on
the
moon
make
no
sudden
movements
you
going
to
try
that
geometry
i
get
a
chance
but
of
course
they
may
make
an
advance
we
remained
passive
and
the
selenites
having
finished
their
arrangements
stood
back
from
us
and
seemed
to
be
looking
at
us
i
say
seemed
to
be
because
as
their
eyes
were
at
the
side
and
not
in
front
one
had
the
same
difficulty
in
determining
the
direction
in
which
they
were
looking
as
one
has
in
the
case
of
a
hen
or
a
fish
they
conversed
with
one
another
in
their
reedy
tones
that
seemed
to
me
impossible
to
imitate
or
define
the
door
behind
us
opened
wider
and
glancing
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
a
vague
large
space
beyond
in
which
quite
a
little
crowd
of
selenites
were
standing
they
seemed
a
curiously
miscellaneous
rabble
they
want
us
to
imitate
those
sounds
i
asked
cavor
think
so
he
said
seems
to
me
that
they
are
trying
to
make
us
understand
make
anything
of
their
gestures
do
you
notice
this
one
who
is
worrying
with
his
head
like
a
man
with
an
uncomfortable
collar
us
shake
our
heads
at
we
did
that
and
finding
it
ineffectual
attempted
an
imitation
of
the
movements
that
seemed
to
interest
them
at
any
rate
they
all
set
up
the
same
movement
but
as
that
seemed
to
lead
to
nothing
we
desisted
at
last
and
so
did
they
and
fell
into
a
piping
argument
among
themselves
then
one
of
them
shorter
and
very
much
thicker
than
the
others
and
with
a
particularly
wide
mouth
squatted
down
suddenly
beside
cavor
and
put
his
hands
and
feet
in
the
same
posture
as
were
bound
and
then
by
a
dexterous
movement
stood
up
i
shouted
want
us
to
get
up
he
stared
it
he
said
and
with
much
heaving
and
grunting
because
our
hands
were
tied
together
we
contrived
to
struggle
to
our
feet
the
selenites
made
way
for
our
elephantine
heavings
and
seemed
to
twitter
more
volubly
as
soon
as
we
were
on
our
feet
the
selenite
came
and
patted
each
of
our
faces
with
his
tentacles
and
walked
towards
the
open
doorway
that
also
was
plain
enough
and
we
followed
him
we
saw
that
four
of
the
selenites
standing
in
the
doorway
were
much
taller
than
the
others
and
clothed
in
the
same
manner
as
those
we
had
seen
in
the
crater
namely
with
spiked
round
helmets
and
cylindrical
and
that
each
of
the
four
carried
a
goad
with
spike
and
guard
made
of
that
same
metal
as
the
bowls
these
four
closed
about
us
one
on
either
side
of
each
of
us
as
we
emerged
from
our
chamber
into
the
cavern
from
which
the
light
had
come
we
did
not
get
our
impression
of
that
cavern
all
at
once
our
attention
was
taken
up
by
the
movements
and
attitudes
of
the
selenites
immediately
about
us
and
by
the
necessity
of
controlling
our
motion
lest
we
should
startle
and
alarm
them
and
ourselves
by
some
excessive
stride
in
front
of
us
was
the
short
being
who
had
solved
the
problem
of
asking
us
to
get
up
moving
with
gestures
that
seemed
almost
all
of
them
intelligible
to
us
inviting
us
to
follow
him
his
face
turned
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
with
a
quickness
that
was
clearly
interrogative
for
a
time
i
say
we
were
taken
up
with
these
things
but
at
last
the
great
place
that
formed
a
background
to
our
movements
asserted
itself
it
became
apparent
that
the
source
of
much
at
least
of
the
tumult
of
sounds
which
had
filled
our
ears
ever
since
we
had
recovered
from
the
stupefaction
of
the
fungus
was
a
vast
mass
of
machinery
in
active
movement
whose
flying
and
whirling
parts
were
visible
indistinctly
over
the
heads
and
between
the
bodies
of
the
selenites
who
walked
about
us
and
not
only
did
the
web
of
sounds
that
filled
the
air
proceed
from
this
mechanism
but
also
the
peculiar
blue
light
that
irradiated
the
whole
place
we
had
taken
it
as
a
natural
thing
that
a
subterranean
cavern
should
be
artificially
lit
and
even
now
though
the
fact
was
patent
to
my
eyes
i
did
not
really
grasp
its
import
until
presently
the
darkness
came
the
meaning
and
structure
of
this
huge
apparatus
we
saw
i
can
not
explain
because
we
neither
of
us
learnt
what
it
was
for
or
how
it
worked
one
after
another
big
shafts
of
metal
flung
out
and
up
from
its
centre
their
heads
travelling
in
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
parabolic
path
each
dropped
a
sort
of
dangling
arm
as
it
rose
towards
the
apex
of
its
flight
and
plunged
down
into
a
vertical
cylinder
forcing
this
down
before
it
about
it
moved
the
shapes
of
tenders
little
figures
that
seemed
vaguely
different
from
the
beings
about
us
as
each
of
the
three
dangling
arms
of
the
machine
plunged
down
there
was
a
clank
and
then
a
roaring
and
out
of
the
top
of
the
vertical
cylinder
came
pouring
this
incandescent
substance
that
lit
the
place
and
ran
over
as
milk
runs
over
a
boiling
pot
and
dripped
luminously
into
a
tank
of
light
below
it
was
a
cold
blue
light
a
sort
of
phosphorescent
glow
but
infinitely
brighter
and
from
the
tanks
into
which
it
fell
it
ran
in
conduits
athwart
the
cavern
thud
thud
thud
thud
came
the
sweeping
arms
of
this
unintelligible
apparatus
and
the
light
substance
hissed
and
poured
at
first
the
thing
seemed
only
reasonably
large
and
near
to
us
and
then
i
saw
how
exceedingly
little
the
selenites
upon
it
seemed
and
i
realised
the
full
immensity
of
cavern
and
machine
i
looked
from
this
tremendous
affair
to
the
faces
of
the
selenites
with
a
new
respect
i
stopped
and
cavor
stopped
and
stared
at
this
thunderous
engine
this
is
stupendous
i
said
can
it
be
for
face
was
full
of
an
intelligent
respect
dream
surely
these
men
could
not
make
a
thing
like
that
look
at
those
arms
are
they
on
connecting
rods
the
selenite
had
gone
some
paces
unheeded
he
came
back
and
stood
between
us
and
the
great
machine
i
avoided
seeing
him
because
i
guessed
somehow
that
his
idea
was
to
beckon
us
onward
he
walked
away
in
the
direction
he
wished
us
to
go
and
turned
and
came
back
and
flicked
our
faces
to
attract
our
attention
cavor
and
i
looked
at
one
another
can
not
we
show
him
we
are
interested
in
the
machine
i
said
said
cavor
try
he
turned
to
our
guide
and
smiled
and
pointed
to
the
machine
and
pointed
again
and
then
to
his
head
and
then
to
the
machine
by
some
defect
of
reasoning
he
seemed
to
imagine
that
broken
english
might
help
these
gestures
look
he
said
think
very
much
his
behaviour
seemed
to
check
the
selenites
in
their
desire
for
our
progress
for
a
moment
they
faced
one
another
their
queer
heads
moved
the
twittering
voices
came
quick
and
liquid
then
one
of
them
a
lean
tall
creature
with
a
sort
of
mantle
added
to
the
puttee
in
which
the
others
were
dressed
twisted
his
elephant
trunk
of
a
hand
about
waist
and
pulled
him
gently
to
follow
our
guide
who
again
went
on
ahead
cavor
resisted
may
just
as
well
begin
explaining
ourselves
now
they
may
think
we
are
new
animals
a
new
sort
of
mooncalf
perhaps
it
is
most
important
that
we
should
show
an
intelligent
interest
from
the
he
began
to
shake
his
head
violently
no
he
said
not
come
on
one
minute
me
look
at
there
some
geometrical
point
you
might
bring
in
of
that
affair
i
suggested
as
the
selenites
conferred
again
a
he
began
he
yelled
loudly
and
leaped
six
feet
or
more
one
of
the
four
armed
had
pricked
him
with
a
goad
i
turned
on
the
behind
me
with
a
swift
threatening
gesture
and
he
started
back
this
and
sudden
shout
and
leap
clearly
astonished
all
the
selenites
they
receded
hastily
facing
us
for
one
of
those
moments
that
seem
to
last
for
ever
we
stood
in
angry
protest
with
a
scattered
semicircle
of
these
inhuman
beings
about
us
pricked
me
said
cavor
with
a
catching
of
the
voice
saw
him
i
answered
it
i
said
to
the
selenites
not
going
to
stand
that
what
on
earth
do
you
take
us
for
i
glanced
quickly
right
and
left
far
away
across
the
blue
wilderness
of
cavern
i
saw
a
number
of
other
selenites
running
towards
us
broad
and
slender
they
were
and
one
with
a
larger
head
than
the
others
the
cavern
spread
wide
and
low
and
receded
in
every
direction
into
darkness
its
roof
i
remember
seemed
to
bulge
down
as
if
with
the
weight
of
the
vast
thickness
of
rocks
that
prisoned
us
there
was
no
way
out
of
way
out
of
it
above
below
in
every
direction
was
the
unknown
and
these
inhuman
creatures
with
goads
and
gestures
confronting
us
and
we
two
unsupported
men
xv
the
giddy
bridge
just
for
a
moment
that
hostile
pause
endured
i
suppose
that
both
we
and
the
selenites
did
some
very
rapid
thinking
my
clearest
impression
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
put
my
back
against
and
that
we
were
bound
to
be
surrounded
and
killed
the
overwhelming
folly
of
our
presence
there
loomed
over
me
in
black
enormous
reproach
why
had
i
ever
launched
myself
on
this
mad
inhuman
expedition
cavor
came
to
my
side
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
his
pale
and
terrified
face
was
ghastly
in
the
blue
light
do
anything
he
said
a
mistake
they
understand
we
must
go
as
they
want
us
to
i
looked
down
at
him
and
then
at
the
fresh
selenites
who
were
coming
to
help
their
fellows
i
had
my
hands
no
use
he
panted
and
he
turned
about
and
led
the
way
in
the
direction
that
had
been
indicated
for
us
i
followed
trying
to
look
as
subdued
as
possible
and
feeling
at
the
chains
about
my
wrists
my
blood
was
boiling
i
noted
nothing
more
of
that
cavern
though
it
seemed
to
take
a
long
time
before
we
had
marched
across
it
or
if
i
noted
anything
i
forgot
it
as
i
saw
it
my
thoughts
were
concentrated
i
think
upon
my
chains
and
the
selenites
and
particularly
upon
the
helmeted
ones
with
the
goads
at
first
they
marched
parallel
with
us
and
at
a
respectful
distance
but
presently
they
were
overtaken
by
three
others
and
then
they
drew
nearer
until
they
were
within
arms
length
again
i
winced
like
a
beaten
horse
as
they
came
near
to
us
the
shorter
thicker
selenite
marched
at
first
on
our
right
flank
but
presently
came
in
front
of
us
again
how
well
the
picture
of
that
grouping
has
bitten
into
my
brain
the
back
of
downcast
head
just
in
front
of
me
and
the
dejected
droop
of
his
shoulders
and
our
gaping
visage
perpetually
jerking
about
him
and
the
on
either
side
watchful
yet
blue
monochrome
and
after
all
i
remember
one
other
thing
besides
the
purely
personal
affair
which
is
that
a
sort
of
gutter
came
presently
across
the
floor
of
the
cavern
and
then
ran
along
by
the
side
of
the
path
of
rock
we
followed
and
it
was
full
of
that
same
bright
blue
luminous
stuff
that
flowed
out
of
the
great
machine
i
walked
close
beside
it
and
i
can
testify
it
radiated
not
a
particle
of
heat
it
was
brightly
shining
and
yet
it
was
neither
warmer
nor
colder
than
anything
else
in
the
cavern
clang
clang
clang
we
passed
right
under
the
thumping
levers
of
another
vast
machine
and
so
came
at
last
to
a
wide
tunnel
in
which
we
could
even
hear
the
pad
pad
of
our
shoeless
feet
and
which
save
for
the
trickling
thread
of
blue
to
the
right
of
us
was
quite
unlit
the
shadows
made
gigantic
travesties
of
our
shapes
and
those
of
the
selenites
on
the
irregular
wall
and
roof
of
the
tunnel
ever
and
again
crystals
in
the
walls
of
the
tunnel
scintillated
like
gems
ever
and
again
the
tunnel
expanded
into
a
stalactitic
cavern
or
gave
off
branches
that
vanished
into
darkness
we
seemed
to
be
marching
down
that
tunnel
for
a
long
time
trickle
went
the
flowing
light
very
softly
and
our
footfalls
and
their
echoes
made
an
irregular
paddle
paddle
my
mind
settled
down
to
the
question
of
my
chains
if
i
were
to
slip
off
one
turn
and
then
to
twist
it
if
i
tried
to
do
it
very
gradually
would
they
see
i
was
slipping
my
wrist
out
of
the
looser
turn
if
they
did
what
would
they
do
said
cavor
goes
down
it
keeps
on
going
his
remark
roused
me
from
my
sullen
they
wanted
to
kill
us
he
said
dropping
back
to
come
level
with
me
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
have
done
i
admitted
understand
us
he
said
think
we
are
merely
strange
animals
some
wild
sort
of
mooncalf
birth
perhaps
it
will
be
only
when
they
have
observed
us
better
that
they
will
begin
to
think
we
have
you
trace
those
geometrical
problems
said
i
may
be
we
tramped
on
for
a
space
see
said
cavor
may
be
selenites
of
a
lower
infernal
fools
said
i
viciously
glancing
at
their
exasperating
faces
we
endure
what
they
do
to
got
to
endure
it
said
i
may
be
others
less
stupid
this
is
the
mere
outer
fringe
of
their
world
it
must
go
down
and
down
cavern
passage
tunnel
down
at
last
to
the
of
miles
his
words
made
me
think
of
the
mile
or
so
of
rock
and
tunnel
that
might
be
over
our
heads
already
it
was
like
a
weight
dropping
on
my
shoulders
from
the
sun
and
air
i
said
a
mine
half
a
mile
deep
is
is
not
anyhow
the
air
would
blow
from
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
to
the
sunlit
and
all
the
carbonic
acid
would
well
out
there
and
feed
those
plants
up
this
tunnel
for
example
there
is
quite
a
breeze
and
what
a
world
it
must
be
the
earnest
we
have
in
that
shaft
and
those
the
goad
i
said
forget
the
goad
he
walked
a
little
in
front
of
me
for
a
time
that
he
said
was
angry
at
the
time
was
perhaps
necessary
we
should
get
on
they
have
different
skins
and
probably
different
nerves
they
may
not
understand
our
as
a
being
from
mars
might
not
like
our
earthly
habit
of
better
be
careful
how
they
nudge
about
that
geometry
after
all
their
way
is
a
way
of
understanding
too
they
begin
with
the
elements
of
life
and
not
of
thought
food
compulsion
pain
they
strike
at
no
doubt
about
i
said
he
went
on
to
talk
of
the
enormous
and
wonderful
world
into
which
we
were
being
taken
i
realised
slowly
from
his
tone
that
even
now
he
was
not
absolutely
in
despair
at
the
prospect
of
going
ever
deeper
into
this
inhuman
his
mind
ran
on
machines
and
invention
to
the
exclusion
of
a
thousand
dark
things
that
beset
me
it
that
he
intended
to
make
any
use
of
these
things
he
simply
wanted
to
know
them
all
he
said
is
a
tremendous
occasion
it
is
the
meeting
of
two
worlds
what
are
we
going
to
see
think
of
what
is
below
us
see
much
if
the
light
better
i
remarked
is
only
the
outer
crust
down
on
this
there
will
be
everything
do
you
notice
how
different
they
seem
one
from
another
the
story
we
shall
take
back
rare
sort
of
animal
i
said
comfort
himself
in
that
way
while
they
were
bringing
him
to
the
zoo
it
follow
that
we
are
going
to
be
shown
all
these
they
find
we
have
reasonable
minds
said
cavor
will
want
to
learn
about
the
earth
even
if
they
have
no
generous
emotions
they
will
teach
in
order
to
learn
and
the
things
they
must
know
the
unanticipated
things
he
went
on
to
speculate
on
the
possibility
of
their
knowing
things
he
had
never
hoped
to
learn
on
earth
speculating
in
that
way
with
a
raw
wound
from
that
goad
already
in
his
skin
much
that
he
said
i
forget
for
my
attention
was
drawn
to
the
fact
that
the
tunnel
along
which
we
had
been
marching
was
opening
out
wider
and
wider
we
seemed
from
the
feeling
of
the
air
to
be
going
out
into
a
huge
space
but
how
big
the
space
might
really
be
we
could
not
tell
because
it
was
unlit
our
little
stream
of
light
ran
in
a
dwindling
thread
and
vanished
far
ahead
presently
the
rocky
walls
had
vanished
altogether
on
either
hand
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
path
in
front
of
us
and
the
trickling
hurrying
rivulet
of
blue
phosphorescence
the
figures
of
cavor
and
the
guiding
selenite
marched
before
me
the
sides
of
their
legs
and
heads
that
were
towards
the
rivulet
were
clear
and
bright
blue
their
darkened
sides
now
that
the
reflection
of
the
tunnel
wall
no
longer
lit
them
merged
indistinguishably
in
the
darkness
beyond
and
soon
i
perceived
that
we
were
approaching
a
declivity
of
some
sort
because
the
little
blue
stream
dipped
suddenly
out
of
sight
in
another
moment
as
it
seemed
we
had
reached
the
edge
the
shining
stream
gave
one
meander
of
hesitation
and
then
rushed
over
it
fell
to
a
depth
at
which
the
sound
of
its
descent
was
absolutely
lost
to
us
far
below
was
a
bluish
glow
a
sort
of
blue
an
infinite
distance
below
and
the
darkness
the
stream
dropped
out
of
became
utterly
void
and
black
save
that
a
thing
like
a
plank
projected
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
stretched
out
and
faded
and
vanished
altogether
there
was
a
warm
air
blowing
up
out
of
the
gulf
for
a
moment
i
and
cavor
stood
as
near
the
edge
as
we
dared
peering
into
a
profundity
and
then
our
guide
was
pulling
at
my
arm
then
he
left
me
and
walked
to
the
end
of
that
plank
and
stepped
upon
it
looking
back
then
when
he
perceived
we
watched
him
he
turned
about
and
went
on
along
it
walking
as
surely
as
though
he
was
on
firm
earth
for
a
moment
his
form
was
distinct
then
he
became
a
blue
blur
and
then
vanished
into
the
obscurity
i
became
aware
of
some
vague
shape
looming
darkly
out
of
the
black
there
was
a
pause
said
cavor
one
of
the
other
selenites
walked
a
few
paces
out
upon
the
plank
and
turned
and
looked
back
at
us
unconcernedly
the
others
stood
ready
to
follow
after
us
our
expectant
figure
reappeared
he
was
returning
to
see
why
we
had
not
advanced
is
that
beyond
there
i
asked
cross
this
at
any
price
said
i
could
not
go
three
steps
on
it
said
cavor
with
my
hands
we
looked
at
each
drawn
faces
in
blank
consternation
know
what
it
is
to
be
giddy
said
cavor
quite
impossible
for
us
to
walk
that
believe
they
see
as
we
do
been
watching
them
i
wonder
if
they
know
this
is
simply
blackness
for
us
how
can
we
make
them
understand
we
must
make
them
i
think
we
said
these
things
with
a
vague
half
hope
the
selenites
might
somehow
understand
i
knew
quite
clearly
that
all
that
was
needed
was
an
explanation
then
as
i
saw
their
faces
i
realised
that
an
explanation
was
impossible
just
here
it
was
that
our
resemblances
were
not
going
to
bridge
our
differences
well
i
going
to
walk
the
plank
anyhow
i
slipped
my
wrist
very
quickly
out
of
the
coil
of
chain
that
was
loose
and
then
began
to
twist
my
wrists
in
opposite
directions
i
was
standing
nearest
to
the
bridge
and
as
i
did
this
two
of
the
selenites
laid
hold
of
me
and
pulled
me
gently
towards
it
i
shook
my
head
violently
go
i
said
use
you
another
selenite
added
his
compulsion
i
was
forced
to
step
forward
got
an
idea
said
cavor
but
i
knew
his
ideas
here
i
exclaimed
to
the
selenites
on
all
very
well
for
i
sprang
round
upon
my
heel
i
burst
out
into
curses
for
one
of
the
armed
selenites
had
stabbed
me
behind
with
his
goad
i
wrenched
my
wrists
free
from
the
little
tentacles
that
held
them
i
turned
on
the
you
i
cried
warned
you
of
that
what
on
earth
do
you
think
made
of
to
stick
that
into
me
if
you
touch
me
by
way
of
answer
he
pricked
me
forthwith
i
heard
voice
in
alarm
and
entreaty
even
then
i
think
he
wanted
to
compromise
with
these
creatures
say
bedford
he
cried
know
a
way
but
the
sting
of
that
second
stab
seemed
to
set
free
some
reserve
of
energy
in
my
being
instantly
the
link
of
the
snapped
and
with
it
snapped
all
considerations
that
had
held
us
unresisting
in
the
hands
of
these
moon
creatures
for
that
second
at
least
i
was
mad
with
fear
and
anger
i
took
no
thought
of
consequences
i
hit
straight
out
at
the
face
of
the
thing
with
the
goad
the
chain
was
twisted
round
my
fist
there
came
another
of
these
beastly
surprises
of
which
the
moon
world
is
full
my
mailed
hand
seemed
to
go
clean
through
him
he
smashed
some
softish
sort
of
sweet
with
liquid
in
it
he
broke
right
in
he
squelched
and
splashed
it
was
like
hitting
a
damp
toadstool
the
flimsy
body
went
spinning
a
dozen
yards
and
fell
with
a
flabby
impact
i
was
astonished
i
was
incredulous
that
any
living
thing
could
be
so
flimsy
for
an
instant
i
could
have
believed
the
whole
thing
a
dream
then
it
had
become
real
and
imminent
again
neither
cavor
nor
the
other
selenites
seemed
to
have
done
anything
from
the
time
when
i
had
turned
about
to
the
time
when
the
dead
selenite
hit
the
ground
every
one
stood
back
from
us
two
every
one
alert
that
arrest
seemed
to
last
at
least
a
second
after
the
selenite
was
down
every
one
must
have
been
taking
the
thing
in
i
seem
to
remember
myself
standing
with
my
arm
half
retracted
trying
also
to
take
it
in
next
clamoured
my
brain
next
then
in
a
moment
every
one
was
moving
i
perceived
we
must
get
our
chains
loose
and
that
before
we
could
do
this
these
selenites
had
to
be
beaten
off
i
faced
towards
the
group
of
the
three
instantly
one
threw
his
goad
at
me
it
swished
over
my
head
and
i
suppose
went
flying
into
the
abyss
behind
i
leaped
right
at
him
with
all
my
might
as
the
goad
flew
over
me
he
turned
to
run
as
i
jumped
and
i
bore
him
to
the
ground
came
down
right
upon
him
and
slipped
upon
his
smashed
body
and
fell
he
seemed
to
wriggle
under
my
foot
i
came
into
a
sitting
position
and
on
every
hand
the
blue
backs
of
the
selenites
were
receding
into
the
darkness
i
bent
a
link
by
main
force
and
untwisted
the
chain
that
had
hampered
me
about
the
ankles
and
sprang
to
my
feet
with
the
chain
in
my
hand
another
goad
flung
whistled
by
me
and
i
made
a
rush
towards
the
darkness
out
of
which
it
had
come
then
i
turned
back
towards
cavor
who
was
still
standing
in
the
light
of
the
rivulet
near
the
gulf
convulsively
busy
with
his
wrists
and
at
the
same
time
jabbering
nonsense
about
his
idea
on
i
cried
hands
he
answered
then
realising
that
i
dared
not
run
back
to
him
because
my
steps
might
carry
me
over
the
edge
he
came
shuffling
towards
me
with
his
hands
held
out
before
him
i
gripped
his
chains
at
once
to
unfasten
them
are
they
he
panted
away
come
back
throwing
things
which
way
shall
we
go
the
light
to
that
tunnel
eh
said
i
and
his
hands
were
free
i
dropped
on
my
knees
and
fell
to
work
on
his
ankle
bonds
whack
came
know
not
splashed
the
livid
streamlet
into
drops
about
us
far
away
on
our
right
a
piping
and
whistling
began
i
whipped
the
chain
off
his
feet
and
put
it
in
his
hand
with
that
i
said
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
set
off
in
big
bounds
along
the
path
by
which
we
had
come
i
had
a
nasty
sort
of
feeling
that
these
things
could
jump
out
of
the
darkness
on
to
my
back
i
heard
the
impact
of
his
leaps
come
following
after
me
we
ran
in
vast
strides
but
that
running
you
must
understand
was
an
altogether
different
thing
from
any
running
on
earth
on
earth
one
leaps
and
almost
instantly
hits
the
ground
again
but
on
the
moon
because
of
its
weaker
pull
one
shot
through
the
air
for
several
seconds
before
one
came
to
earth
in
spite
of
our
violent
hurry
this
gave
an
effect
of
long
pauses
pauses
in
which
one
might
have
counted
seven
or
eight
and
one
soared
off
all
sorts
of
questions
ran
through
my
mind
are
the
selenites
what
will
they
do
shall
we
ever
get
to
that
tunnel
is
cavor
far
behind
are
they
likely
to
cut
him
off
then
whack
stride
and
off
again
for
another
step
i
saw
a
selenite
running
in
front
of
me
his
legs
going
exactly
as
a
would
go
on
earth
saw
him
glance
over
his
shoulder
and
heard
him
shriek
as
he
ran
aside
out
of
my
way
into
the
darkness
he
was
i
think
our
guide
but
i
am
not
sure
then
in
another
vast
stride
the
walls
of
rock
had
come
into
view
on
either
hand
and
in
two
more
strides
i
was
in
the
tunnel
and
tempering
my
pace
to
its
low
roof
i
went
on
to
a
bend
then
stopped
and
turned
back
and
plug
plug
plug
cavor
came
into
view
splashing
into
the
stream
of
blue
light
at
every
stride
and
grew
larger
and
blundered
into
me
we
stood
clutching
each
other
for
a
moment
at
least
we
had
shaken
off
our
captors
and
were
alone
we
were
both
very
much
out
of
breath
we
spoke
in
panting
broken
sentences
spoilt
it
all
panted
cavor
i
cried
was
that
or
death
are
we
to
do
can
we
dark
where
one
of
these
side
then
we
strode
on
and
presently
came
to
a
radiating
dark
cavern
cavor
was
in
front
he
hesitated
and
chose
a
black
mouth
that
seemed
to
promise
good
hiding
he
went
towards
it
and
turned
dark
he
said
legs
and
feet
will
light
us
wet
with
that
luminous
a
tumult
of
sounds
and
in
particular
a
sound
like
a
clanging
gong
advancing
up
the
main
tunnel
became
audible
it
was
horribly
suggestive
of
a
tumultuous
pursuit
we
made
a
bolt
for
the
unlit
side
cavern
forthwith
as
we
ran
along
it
our
way
was
lit
by
the
irradiation
of
legs
lucky
i
panted
took
off
our
boots
or
we
should
fill
this
place
with
on
we
rushed
taking
as
small
steps
as
we
could
to
avoid
striking
the
roof
of
the
cavern
after
a
time
we
seemed
to
be
gaining
on
the
uproar
it
became
muffled
it
dwindled
it
died
away
i
stopped
and
looked
back
and
i
heard
the
pad
pad
of
feet
receding
then
he
stopped
also
he
whispered
a
sort
of
light
in
front
of
i
looked
and
at
first
could
see
nothing
then
i
perceived
his
head
and
shoulders
dimly
outlined
against
a
fainter
darkness
i
saw
also
that
this
mitigation
of
the
darkness
was
not
blue
as
all
the
other
light
within
the
moon
had
been
but
a
pallid
grey
a
very
vague
faint
white
the
daylight
colour
cavor
noted
this
difference
as
soon
or
sooner
than
i
did
and
i
think
too
that
it
filled
him
with
much
the
same
wild
hope
he
whispered
and
his
voice
trembled
is
he
did
not
dare
to
say
the
thing
he
hoped
then
came
a
pause
suddenly
i
knew
by
the
sound
of
his
feet
that
he
was
striding
towards
that
pallor
i
followed
him
with
a
beating
heart
xvi
points
of
view
the
light
grew
stronger
as
we
advanced
in
a
little
time
it
was
nearly
as
strong
as
the
phosphorescence
on
legs
our
tunnel
was
expanding
into
a
cavern
and
this
new
light
was
at
the
farther
end
of
it
i
perceived
something
that
set
my
hopes
leaping
and
bounding
i
said
comes
from
above
i
am
certain
it
comes
from
above
he
made
no
answer
but
hurried
on
indisputably
it
was
a
grey
light
a
silvery
light
in
another
moment
we
were
beneath
it
it
filtered
down
through
a
chink
in
the
walls
of
the
cavern
and
as
i
stared
up
drip
came
a
drop
of
water
upon
my
face
i
started
and
stood
fell
another
drop
quite
audibly
on
the
rocky
floor
i
said
one
of
us
lifts
the
other
he
can
reach
that
crack
lift
you
he
said
and
incontinently
hoisted
me
as
though
i
was
a
baby
i
thrust
an
arm
into
the
crack
and
just
at
my
finger
tips
found
a
little
ledge
by
which
i
could
hold
i
could
see
the
white
light
was
very
much
brighter
now
i
pulled
myself
up
by
two
fingers
with
scarcely
an
effort
though
on
earth
i
weigh
twelve
stone
reached
to
a
still
higher
corner
of
rock
and
so
got
my
feet
on
the
narrow
ledge
i
stood
up
and
searched
up
the
rocks
with
my
fingers
the
cleft
broadened
out
upwardly
climbable
i
said
to
cavor
you
jump
up
to
my
hand
if
i
hold
it
down
to
you
i
wedged
myself
between
the
sides
of
the
cleft
rested
knee
and
foot
on
the
ledge
and
extended
a
hand
i
could
not
see
cavor
but
i
could
hear
the
rustle
of
his
movements
as
he
crouched
to
spring
then
whack
and
he
was
hanging
to
my
no
heavier
than
a
kitten
i
lugged
him
up
until
he
had
a
hand
on
my
ledge
and
could
release
me
it
i
said
one
could
be
a
mountaineer
on
the
moon
and
so
set
myself
in
earnest
to
the
climbing
for
a
few
minutes
i
clambered
steadily
and
then
i
looked
up
again
the
cleft
opened
out
steadily
and
the
light
was
brighter
it
was
not
daylight
after
all
in
another
moment
i
could
see
what
it
was
and
at
the
sight
i
could
have
beaten
my
head
against
the
rocks
with
disappointment
for
i
beheld
simply
an
irregularly
sloping
open
space
and
all
over
its
slanting
floor
stood
a
forest
of
little
fungi
each
shining
gloriously
with
that
pinkish
silvery
light
for
a
moment
i
stared
at
their
soft
radiance
then
sprang
forward
and
upward
among
them
i
plucked
up
half
a
dozen
and
flung
them
against
the
rocks
and
then
sat
down
laughing
bitterly
as
ruddy
face
came
into
view
phosphorescence
again
i
said
need
to
hurry
sit
down
and
make
yourself
at
and
as
he
spluttered
over
our
disappointment
i
began
to
lob
more
of
these
growths
into
the
cleft
thought
it
was
daylight
he
said
cried
i
sunset
clouds
and
windy
skies
shall
we
ever
see
such
things
again
as
i
spoke
a
little
picture
of
our
world
seemed
to
rise
before
me
bright
and
little
and
clear
like
the
background
of
some
old
italian
picture
sky
that
changes
and
the
sea
that
changes
and
the
hills
and
the
green
trees
and
the
towns
and
cities
shining
in
the
sun
think
of
a
wet
roof
at
sunset
cavor
think
of
the
windows
of
a
westward
house
he
made
no
answer
we
are
burrowing
in
this
beastly
world
that
a
world
with
its
inky
ocean
hidden
in
some
abominable
blackness
below
and
outside
that
torrid
day
and
that
death
stillness
of
night
and
all
these
things
that
are
chasing
us
now
beastly
men
of
men
that
come
out
of
a
nightmare
after
all
right
what
business
have
we
here
smashing
them
and
disturbing
their
world
for
all
we
know
the
whole
planet
is
up
and
after
us
already
in
a
minute
we
may
hear
them
whimpering
and
their
gongs
going
what
are
we
to
do
where
are
we
to
go
here
we
are
as
comfortable
as
snakes
from
loose
in
a
surbiton
villa
was
your
fault
said
cavor
fault
i
shouted
lord
had
an
idea
your
ideas
we
had
refused
to
those
goads
they
would
have
carried
us
that
bridge
they
must
have
carried
us
from
rather
be
carried
by
a
fly
across
a
heavens
i
resumed
my
destruction
of
the
fungi
then
suddenly
i
saw
something
that
struck
me
even
then
i
said
chains
are
of
gold
he
was
thinking
intently
with
his
hands
gripping
his
cheeks
he
turned
his
head
slowly
and
stared
at
me
and
when
i
had
repeated
my
words
at
the
twisted
chain
about
his
right
hand
they
are
he
said
they
his
face
lost
its
transitory
interest
even
as
he
looked
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
went
on
with
his
interrupted
meditation
i
sat
for
a
space
puzzling
over
the
fact
that
i
had
only
just
observed
this
until
i
considered
the
blue
light
in
which
we
had
been
and
which
had
taken
all
the
colour
out
of
the
metal
and
from
that
discovery
i
also
started
upon
a
train
of
thought
that
carried
me
wide
and
far
i
forgot
that
i
had
just
been
asking
what
business
we
had
in
the
moon
gold
it
was
cavor
who
spoke
first
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
courses
open
to
we
can
attempt
to
make
our
our
way
if
to
the
exterior
again
and
then
hunt
for
our
sphere
until
we
find
it
or
the
cold
of
the
night
comes
to
kill
us
or
he
paused
i
said
though
i
knew
what
was
coming
might
attempt
once
more
to
establish
some
sort
of
understanding
with
the
minds
of
the
people
in
the
far
as
the
see
said
cavor
do
not
think
we
can
judge
the
selenites
by
what
we
have
seen
of
them
their
central
world
their
civilised
world
will
be
far
below
in
the
profounder
caverns
about
their
sea
this
region
of
the
crust
in
which
we
are
is
an
outlying
district
a
pastoral
region
at
any
rate
that
is
my
interpretation
these
selenites
we
have
seen
may
be
only
the
equivalent
of
cowboys
and
their
use
of
all
probability
mooncalf
lack
of
imagination
they
show
in
expecting
us
to
be
able
to
do
just
what
they
can
do
their
indisputable
brutality
all
seem
to
point
to
something
of
that
sort
but
if
we
of
us
could
endure
a
plank
across
the
bottomless
pit
for
very
said
cavor
i
said
he
discovered
a
new
line
of
possibilities
suppose
we
got
ourselves
into
some
corner
where
we
could
defend
ourselves
against
these
hinds
and
labourers
if
for
example
we
could
hold
out
for
a
week
or
so
it
is
probable
that
the
news
of
our
appearance
would
filter
down
to
the
more
intelligent
and
populous
they
must
exist
or
whence
came
those
tremendous
machines
possible
but
the
worst
of
the
two
might
write
up
inscriptions
on
do
we
know
their
eyes
would
see
the
sort
of
marks
we
made
we
cut
possible
of
i
took
up
a
new
thread
of
thought
all
i
said
suppose
you
think
these
selenites
so
infinitely
wiser
than
must
know
a
lot
at
least
a
lot
of
different
i
hesitated
think
quite
admit
cavor
that
rather
an
exceptional
a
rather
lonely
been
that
is
you
wanted
to
but
you
never
grew
richer
than
you
happened
to
be
wanted
that
just
rooted
after
knowledge
a
certain
curiosity
is
think
so
just
it
you
think
every
other
mind
wants
to
i
remember
once
when
i
asked
you
why
you
conducted
all
these
researches
you
said
you
wanted
your
and
to
have
the
stuff
called
cavorite
and
things
like
that
you
know
perfectly
well
you
do
it
for
that
but
at
the
time
my
question
took
you
by
surprise
and
you
felt
you
ought
to
have
something
to
look
like
a
motive
really
you
conducted
researches
because
you
to
your
it
one
man
in
a
million
has
that
twist
most
men
various
things
but
very
few
want
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
i
know
perfectly
well
now
these
selenites
seem
to
be
a
driving
busy
sort
of
being
but
how
do
you
know
that
even
the
most
intelligent
will
take
an
interest
in
us
or
our
world
i
believe
even
know
we
have
a
world
they
never
come
out
at
freeze
if
they
did
probably
never
seen
any
heavenly
body
at
all
except
the
blazing
sun
how
are
they
to
know
there
is
another
world
what
does
it
matter
to
them
if
they
do
well
even
if
they
had
a
glimpse
of
a
few
stars
or
even
of
the
earth
crescent
what
of
that
why
should
people
living
a
planet
trouble
to
observe
that
sort
of
thing
men
have
done
it
except
for
the
seasons
and
sailing
why
should
the
moon
people
suppose
there
are
a
few
philosophers
like
yourself
they
are
just
the
very
selenites
never
have
heard
of
our
existence
suppose
a
selenite
had
dropped
on
the
earth
when
you
were
at
lympne
have
been
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
hear
he
had
come
you
never
read
a
newspaper
you
see
the
chances
against
you
well
for
these
chances
sitting
here
doing
nothing
while
precious
time
is
flying
i
tell
you
got
into
a
fix
come
unarmed
lost
our
sphere
got
no
food
shown
ourselves
to
the
selenites
and
made
them
think
strange
strong
dangerous
animals
and
unless
these
selenites
are
perfect
fools
set
about
now
and
hunt
us
till
they
find
us
and
when
they
find
us
try
to
take
us
if
they
can
and
kill
us
if
they
and
the
end
of
the
matter
if
they
take
us
probably
kill
us
through
some
misunderstanding
after
done
for
they
may
discuss
us
perhaps
but
we
get
much
fun
out
of
the
other
hand
gold
knocking
about
like
cast
iron
at
home
if
only
we
can
get
some
of
it
back
if
only
we
can
find
our
sphere
again
before
they
do
and
get
back
might
put
the
thing
on
a
sounder
footing
come
back
in
a
bigger
sphere
with
lord
cried
cavor
as
though
that
was
horrible
i
shied
another
luminous
fungus
down
the
cleft
here
cavor
i
said
half
the
voting
power
anyhow
in
this
affair
and
this
is
a
case
for
a
practical
man
a
practical
man
and
you
are
not
not
going
to
trust
to
selenites
and
geometrical
diagrams
if
i
can
help
it
all
get
back
drop
all
this
most
of
it
and
come
he
reflected
i
came
to
the
moon
he
said
ought
to
have
come
question
before
the
meeting
i
said
how
to
get
back
to
the
for
a
time
we
nursed
our
knees
in
silence
then
he
seemed
to
decide
for
my
reasons
think
he
said
can
get
data
it
is
clear
that
while
the
sun
is
on
this
side
of
the
moon
the
air
will
be
blowing
through
this
planet
sponge
from
the
dark
side
hither
on
this
side
at
any
rate
the
air
will
be
expanding
and
flowing
out
of
the
moon
caverns
into
the
craters
very
well
a
draught
there
that
means
that
this
is
not
a
dead
end
somewhere
behind
us
this
cleft
goes
on
and
up
the
draught
is
blowing
up
and
that
is
the
way
we
have
to
go
if
we
try
to
get
up
any
sort
of
chimney
or
gully
there
is
we
shall
not
only
get
out
of
these
passages
where
they
are
hunting
for
suppose
the
gully
is
too
narrow
come
down
i
said
suddenly
that
we
listened
at
first
it
was
an
indistinct
murmur
and
then
one
picked
out
the
clang
of
a
gong
must
think
we
are
mooncalves
said
i
be
frightened
at
coming
along
that
passage
said
cavor
must
not
think
of
the
cleft
go
i
listened
again
for
a
space
time
i
whispered
likely
to
have
some
sort
of
then
suddenly
i
sprang
to
my
feet
heavens
cavor
i
cried
they
see
the
fungi
i
have
been
pitching
down
i
finish
my
sentence
i
turned
about
and
made
a
leap
over
the
fungus
tops
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
cavity
i
saw
that
the
space
turned
upward
and
became
a
draughty
cleft
again
ascending
to
impenetrable
darkness
i
was
about
to
clamber
up
into
this
and
then
with
a
happy
inspiration
turned
back
are
you
doing
asked
cavor
on
said
i
and
went
back
and
got
two
of
the
shining
fungi
and
putting
one
into
the
breast
pocket
of
my
flannel
jacket
so
that
it
stuck
out
to
light
our
climbing
went
back
with
the
other
for
cavor
the
noise
of
the
selenites
was
now
so
loud
that
it
seemed
they
must
be
already
beneath
the
cleft
but
it
might
be
they
would
have
difficulty
in
clambering
in
to
it
or
might
hesitate
to
ascend
it
against
our
possible
resistance
at
any
rate
we
had
now
the
comforting
knowledge
of
the
enormous
muscular
superiority
our
birth
in
another
planet
gave
us
in
other
minute
i
was
clambering
with
gigantic
vigour
after
heels
xvii
the
fight
in
the
cave
of
the
moon
butchers
i
do
not
know
how
far
we
clambered
before
we
came
to
the
grating
it
may
be
we
ascended
only
a
few
hundred
feet
but
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
me
we
might
have
hauled
and
jammed
and
hopped
and
wedged
ourselves
through
a
mile
or
more
of
vertical
ascent
whenever
i
recall
that
time
there
comes
into
my
head
the
heavy
clank
of
our
golden
chains
that
followed
every
movement
very
soon
my
knuckles
and
knees
were
raw
and
i
had
a
bruise
on
one
cheek
after
a
time
the
first
violence
of
our
efforts
diminished
and
our
movements
became
more
deliberate
and
less
painful
the
noise
of
the
pursuing
selenites
had
died
away
altogether
it
seemed
almost
as
though
they
had
not
traced
us
up
the
crack
after
all
in
spite
of
the
heap
of
broken
fungi
that
must
have
lain
beneath
it
at
times
the
cleft
narrowed
so
much
that
we
could
scarce
squeeze
up
it
at
others
it
expanded
into
great
drusy
cavities
studded
with
prickly
crystals
or
thickly
beset
with
dull
shining
fungoid
pimples
sometimes
it
twisted
spirally
and
at
other
times
slanted
down
nearly
to
the
horizontal
direction
ever
and
again
there
was
the
intermittent
drip
and
trickle
of
water
by
us
once
or
twice
it
seemed
to
us
that
small
living
things
had
rustled
out
of
our
reach
but
what
they
were
we
never
saw
they
may
have
been
venomous
beasts
for
all
i
know
but
they
did
us
no
harm
and
we
were
now
tuned
to
a
pitch
when
a
weird
creeping
thing
more
or
less
mattered
little
and
at
last
far
above
came
the
familiar
bluish
light
again
and
then
we
saw
that
it
filtered
through
a
grating
that
barred
our
way
we
whispered
as
we
pointed
this
out
to
one
another
and
became
more
and
more
cautious
in
our
ascent
presently
we
were
close
under
the
grating
and
by
pressing
my
face
against
its
bars
i
could
see
a
limited
portion
of
the
cavern
beyond
it
was
clearly
a
large
space
and
lit
no
doubt
by
some
rivulet
of
the
same
blue
light
that
we
had
seen
flow
from
the
beating
machinery
an
intermittent
trickle
of
water
dropped
ever
and
again
between
the
bars
near
my
face
my
first
endeavour
was
naturally
to
see
what
might
be
upon
the
floor
of
the
cavern
but
our
grating
lay
in
a
depression
whose
rim
hid
all
this
from
our
eyes
our
foiled
attention
then
fell
back
upon
the
suggestion
of
the
various
sounds
we
heard
and
presently
my
eye
caught
a
number
of
faint
shadows
that
played
across
the
dim
roof
far
overhead
indisputably
there
were
several
selenites
perhaps
a
considerable
number
in
this
space
for
we
could
hear
the
noises
of
their
intercourse
and
faint
sounds
that
i
identified
as
their
footfalls
there
was
also
a
succession
of
regularly
repeated
chid
began
and
ceased
suggestive
of
a
knife
or
spade
hacking
at
some
soft
substance
then
came
a
clank
as
if
of
chains
a
whistle
and
a
rumble
as
of
a
truck
running
over
a
hollowed
place
and
then
again
that
chid
chid
chid
resumed
the
shadows
told
of
shapes
that
moved
quickly
and
rhythmically
in
agreement
with
that
regular
sound
and
rested
when
it
ceased
we
put
our
heads
close
together
and
began
to
discuss
these
things
in
noiseless
whispers
are
occupied
i
said
are
occupied
in
some
not
seeking
us
or
thinking
of
they
have
not
heard
of
others
are
hunting
about
below
if
suddenly
we
appeared
we
looked
at
one
another
might
be
a
chance
to
parley
said
cavor
i
said
as
we
for
a
space
we
remained
each
occupied
by
his
own
thoughts
chid
chid
chid
went
the
chipping
and
the
shadows
moved
to
and
fro
i
looked
at
the
grating
flimsy
i
said
might
bend
two
of
the
bars
and
crawl
we
wasted
a
little
time
in
vague
discussion
then
i
took
one
of
the
bars
in
both
hands
and
got
my
feet
up
against
the
rock
until
they
were
almost
on
a
level
with
my
head
and
so
thrust
against
the
bar
it
bent
so
suddenly
that
i
almost
slipped
i
clambered
about
and
bent
the
adjacent
bar
in
the
opposite
direction
and
then
took
the
luminous
fungus
from
my
pocket
and
dropped
it
down
the
fissure
do
anything
hastily
whispered
cavor
as
i
twisted
myself
up
through
the
opening
i
had
enlarged
i
had
a
glimpse
of
busy
figures
as
i
came
through
the
grating
and
immediately
bent
down
so
that
the
rim
of
the
depression
in
which
the
grating
lay
hid
me
from
their
eyes
and
so
lay
flat
signalling
advice
to
cavor
as
he
also
prepared
to
come
through
presently
we
were
side
by
side
in
the
depression
peering
over
the
edge
at
the
cavern
and
its
occupants
it
was
a
much
larger
cavern
than
we
had
supposed
from
our
first
glimpse
of
it
and
we
looked
up
from
the
lowest
portion
of
its
sloping
floor
it
widened
out
as
it
receded
from
us
and
its
roof
came
down
and
hid
the
remoter
portion
altogether
and
lying
in
a
line
along
its
length
vanishing
at
last
far
away
in
that
tremendous
perspective
were
a
number
of
huge
shapes
huge
pallid
hulls
upon
which
the
selenites
were
busy
at
first
they
seemed
big
white
cylinders
of
vague
import
then
i
noted
the
heads
upon
them
lying
towards
us
eyeless
and
skinless
like
the
heads
of
sheep
at
a
and
perceived
they
were
the
carcasses
of
mooncalves
being
cut
up
much
as
the
crew
of
a
whaler
might
cut
up
a
moored
whale
they
were
cutting
off
the
flesh
in
strips
and
on
some
of
the
farther
trunks
the
white
ribs
were
showing
it
was
the
sound
of
their
hatchets
that
made
that
chid
chid
chid
some
way
away
a
thing
like
a
trolley
cable
drawn
and
loaded
with
chunks
of
lax
meat
was
running
up
the
slope
of
the
cavern
floor
this
enormous
long
avenue
of
hulls
that
were
destined
to
be
food
gave
us
a
sense
of
the
vast
populousness
of
the
moon
world
second
only
to
the
effect
of
our
first
glimpse
down
the
shaft
it
seemed
to
me
at
first
that
the
selenites
must
be
standing
on
planks
and
then
i
saw
that
the
planks
and
supports
and
the
hatchets
were
really
of
the
same
leaden
hue
as
my
fetters
had
seemed
before
white
light
came
to
bear
on
them
a
number
of
very
crowbars
lay
about
the
floor
and
had
apparently
assisted
to
turn
the
dead
mooncalf
over
on
its
side
they
were
perhaps
six
feet
long
with
shaped
handles
very
weapons
the
whole
place
was
lit
by
three
transverse
streams
of
the
blue
fluid
i
do
not
remember
seeing
any
wooden
things
on
the
moon
doors
tables
everything
corresponding
to
our
terrestrial
joinery
was
made
of
metal
and
i
believe
for
the
most
part
of
gold
which
as
a
metal
would
of
course
naturally
recommend
things
being
account
of
the
ease
in
working
it
and
its
toughness
and
durability
we
lay
for
a
long
time
noting
all
these
things
in
silence
said
cavor
at
last
i
crouched
over
and
turned
to
him
i
had
come
upon
a
brilliant
idea
they
lowered
those
bodies
by
a
crane
i
said
must
be
nearer
the
surface
than
i
mooncalf
hop
and
it
got
he
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
hollow
again
wonder
he
began
all
we
have
never
gone
far
from
the
i
stopped
him
by
a
grip
on
his
arm
i
had
heard
a
noise
from
the
cleft
below
us
we
twisted
ourselves
about
and
lay
as
still
as
death
with
every
sense
alert
in
a
little
while
i
did
not
doubt
that
something
was
quietly
ascending
the
cleft
very
slowly
and
quite
noiselessly
i
assured
myself
of
a
good
grip
on
my
chain
and
waited
for
that
something
to
appear
look
at
those
chaps
with
the
hatchets
again
i
said
all
right
said
cavor
i
took
a
sort
of
provisional
aim
at
the
gap
in
the
grating
i
could
hear
now
quite
distinctly
the
soft
twittering
of
the
ascending
selenites
the
dab
of
their
hands
against
the
rock
and
the
falling
of
dust
from
their
grips
as
they
clambered
then
i
could
see
that
there
was
something
moving
dimly
in
the
blackness
below
the
grating
but
what
it
might
be
i
could
not
distinguish
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
hang
fire
just
for
a
smash
i
had
sprung
to
my
feet
struck
savagely
at
something
that
had
flashed
out
at
me
it
was
the
keen
point
of
a
spear
i
have
thought
since
that
its
length
in
the
narrowness
of
the
cleft
must
have
prevented
its
being
sloped
to
reach
me
anyhow
it
shot
out
from
the
grating
like
the
tongue
of
a
snake
and
missed
and
flew
back
and
flashed
again
but
the
second
time
i
snatched
and
caught
it
and
wrenched
it
away
but
not
before
another
had
darted
ineffectually
at
me
i
shouted
with
triumph
as
i
felt
the
hold
of
the
selenite
resist
my
pull
for
a
moment
and
give
and
then
i
was
jabbing
down
through
the
bars
amidst
squeals
from
the
darkness
and
cavor
had
snapped
off
the
other
spear
and
was
leaping
and
flourishing
it
beside
me
and
making
inefficient
jabs
clang
clang
came
up
through
the
grating
and
then
an
axe
hurtled
through
the
air
and
whacked
against
the
rocks
beyond
to
remind
me
of
the
fleshers
at
the
carcasses
up
the
cavern
i
turned
and
they
were
all
coming
towards
us
in
open
order
waving
their
axes
they
were
short
thick
little
beggars
with
long
arms
strikingly
different
from
the
ones
we
had
seen
before
if
they
had
not
heard
of
us
before
they
must
have
realised
the
situation
with
incredible
swiftness
i
stared
at
them
for
a
moment
spear
in
hand
that
grating
cavor
i
cried
howled
to
intimidate
them
and
rushed
to
meet
them
two
of
them
missed
with
their
hatchets
and
the
rest
fled
incontinently
then
the
two
also
were
sprinting
away
up
the
cavern
with
hands
clenched
and
heads
down
i
never
saw
men
run
like
them
i
knew
the
spear
i
had
was
no
good
for
me
it
was
thin
and
flimsy
only
effectual
for
a
thrust
and
too
long
for
a
quick
recover
so
i
only
chased
the
selenites
as
far
as
the
first
carcass
and
stopped
there
and
picked
up
one
of
the
crowbars
that
were
lying
about
it
felt
comfortingly
heavy
and
equal
to
smashing
any
number
of
selenites
i
threw
away
my
spear
and
picked
up
a
second
crowbar
for
the
other
hand
i
felt
five
times
better
than
i
had
with
the
spear
i
shook
the
two
threateningly
at
the
selenites
who
had
come
to
a
halt
in
a
little
crowd
far
away
up
the
cavern
and
then
turned
about
to
look
at
cavor
he
was
leaping
from
side
to
side
of
the
grating
making
threatening
jabs
with
his
broken
spear
that
was
all
right
it
would
keep
the
selenites
a
time
at
any
rate
i
looked
up
the
cavern
again
what
on
earth
were
we
going
to
do
now
we
were
cornered
in
a
sort
of
way
already
but
these
butchers
up
the
cavern
had
been
surprised
they
were
probably
scared
and
they
had
no
special
weapons
only
those
little
hatchets
of
theirs
and
that
way
lay
escape
their
sturdy
little
so
much
shorter
and
thicker
than
the
mooncalf
scattered
up
the
slope
in
a
way
that
was
eloquent
of
indecision
i
had
the
moral
advantage
of
a
mad
bull
in
a
street
but
for
all
that
there
seemed
a
tremendous
crowd
of
them
very
probably
there
was
those
selenites
down
the
cleft
had
certainly
some
infernally
long
spears
it
might
be
they
had
other
surprises
for
us
but
confound
it
if
we
charged
up
the
cave
we
should
let
them
up
behind
us
and
if
we
those
little
brutes
up
the
cave
would
probably
get
reinforced
heaven
alone
knew
what
tremendous
engines
of
bombs
terrestrial
unknown
world
below
our
feet
this
vaster
world
of
which
we
had
only
pricked
the
outer
cuticle
might
not
presently
send
up
to
our
destruction
it
became
clear
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
charge
it
became
clearer
as
the
legs
of
a
number
of
fresh
selenites
appeared
running
down
the
cavern
towards
us
cried
cavor
and
behold
he
was
halfway
between
me
and
the
grating
back
i
cried
are
you
like
a
gun
and
struggling
in
the
grating
between
those
defensive
spears
appeared
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
singularly
lean
and
angular
selenite
bearing
some
complicated
apparatus
i
realised
utter
incapacity
for
the
fight
we
had
in
hand
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
then
i
rushed
past
him
whirling
my
crowbars
and
shouting
to
confound
the
aim
of
the
selenite
he
was
aiming
in
the
queerest
way
with
the
thing
against
his
stomach
the
thing
a
gun
it
went
off
like
a
more
and
dropped
me
in
the
middle
of
a
leap
i
fall
down
i
simply
came
down
a
little
shorter
than
i
should
have
done
if
i
been
hit
and
from
the
feel
of
my
shoulder
the
thing
might
have
tapped
me
and
glanced
off
then
my
left
hand
hit
against
the
shaft
and
i
perceived
there
was
a
sort
of
spear
sticking
half
through
my
shoulder
the
moment
after
i
got
home
with
the
crowbar
in
my
right
hand
and
hit
the
selenite
fair
and
square
he
crushed
and
head
smashed
like
an
egg
i
dropped
a
crowbar
pulled
the
spear
out
of
my
shoulder
and
began
to
jab
it
down
the
grating
into
the
darkness
at
each
jab
came
a
shriek
and
twitter
finally
i
hurled
the
spear
down
upon
them
with
all
my
strength
leapt
up
picked
up
the
crowbar
again
and
started
for
the
multitude
up
the
cavern
cried
cavor
as
i
flew
past
him
i
seem
to
remember
his
footsteps
coming
on
behind
me
step
leap
whack
step
leap
each
leap
seemed
to
last
ages
with
each
the
cave
opened
out
and
the
number
of
selenites
visible
increased
at
first
they
seemed
all
running
about
like
ants
in
a
disturbed
one
or
two
waving
hatchets
and
coming
to
meet
me
more
running
away
some
bolting
sideways
into
the
avenue
of
carcasses
then
presently
others
came
in
sight
carrying
spears
and
then
others
i
saw
a
most
extraordinary
thing
all
hands
and
feet
bolting
for
cover
the
cavern
grew
darker
farther
up
flick
something
flew
over
my
head
flick
as
i
soared
in
i
saw
a
spear
hit
and
quiver
in
one
of
the
carcasses
to
my
left
then
as
i
came
down
one
hit
the
ground
before
me
and
i
heard
the
remote
chuzz
with
which
their
things
were
fired
flick
flick
for
a
moment
it
was
a
shower
they
were
volleying
i
stopped
dead
i
think
i
thought
clearly
then
i
seem
to
remember
a
kind
of
stereotyped
phrase
running
through
my
mind
of
fire
seek
cover
i
know
i
made
a
dash
for
the
space
between
two
of
the
carcasses
and
stood
there
panting
and
feeling
very
wicked
i
looked
round
for
cavor
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
vanished
from
the
world
then
he
came
out
of
the
darkness
between
the
row
of
the
carcasses
and
the
rocky
wall
of
the
cavern
i
saw
his
little
face
dark
and
blue
and
shining
with
perspiration
and
emotion
he
was
saying
something
but
what
it
was
i
did
not
heed
i
had
realised
that
we
might
work
from
mooncalf
to
mooncalf
up
the
cave
until
we
were
near
enough
to
charge
home
it
was
charge
or
nothing
on
i
said
and
led
the
way
he
cried
unavailingly
my
mind
was
busy
as
we
went
up
that
narrow
alley
between
the
dead
bodies
and
the
wall
of
the
cavern
the
rocks
curved
could
not
enfilade
us
though
in
that
narrow
space
we
could
not
leap
yet
with
our
strength
we
were
still
able
to
go
very
much
faster
than
the
selenites
i
reckoned
we
should
presently
come
right
among
them
once
we
were
on
them
they
would
be
nearly
as
formidable
as
black
beetles
only
there
would
first
of
all
be
a
volley
i
thought
of
a
stratagem
i
whipped
off
my
flannel
jacket
as
i
ran
panted
cavor
behind
me
i
glanced
back
said
i
he
was
pointing
upward
over
the
carcasses
light
he
said
light
again
i
looked
and
it
was
even
so
a
faint
white
ghost
of
light
in
the
remoter
cavern
roof
that
seemed
to
give
me
double
strength
close
i
said
a
flat
long
selenite
dashed
out
of
the
darkness
and
squealed
and
fled
i
halted
and
stopped
cavor
with
my
hand
i
hung
my
jacket
over
my
crowbar
ducked
round
the
next
carcass
dropped
jacket
and
crowbar
showed
myself
and
darted
back
just
one
arrow
came
we
were
close
on
the
selenites
and
they
were
standing
in
a
crowd
broad
short
and
tall
together
with
a
little
battery
of
their
shooting
implements
pointing
down
the
cave
three
or
four
other
arrows
followed
the
first
then
their
fire
ceased
i
stuck
out
my
head
and
escaped
by
a
this
time
i
drew
a
dozen
shots
or
more
and
heard
the
selenites
shouting
and
twittering
as
if
with
excitement
as
they
shot
i
picked
up
jacket
and
crowbar
again
said
i
and
thrust
out
the
jacket
chuzz
in
an
instant
my
jacket
had
grown
a
thick
beard
of
arrows
and
they
were
quivering
all
over
the
carcass
behind
us
instantly
i
slipped
the
crowbar
out
of
the
jacket
dropped
the
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
it
is
lying
up
there
in
the
moon
rushed
out
upon
them
for
a
minute
perhaps
it
was
massacre
i
was
too
fierce
to
discriminate
and
the
selenites
were
probably
too
scared
to
fight
at
any
rate
they
made
no
sort
of
fight
against
me
i
saw
scarlet
as
the
saying
is
i
remember
i
seemed
to
be
wading
among
those
leathery
thin
things
as
a
man
wades
through
tall
grass
mowing
and
hitting
first
right
then
left
smash
little
drops
of
moisture
flew
about
i
trod
on
things
that
crushed
and
piped
and
went
slippery
the
crowd
seemed
to
open
and
close
and
flow
like
water
they
seemed
to
have
no
combined
plan
whatever
there
were
spears
flew
about
me
i
was
grazed
over
the
ear
by
one
i
was
stabbed
once
in
the
arm
and
once
in
the
cheek
but
i
only
found
that
out
afterwards
when
the
blood
had
had
time
to
run
and
cool
and
feel
wet
what
cavor
did
i
do
not
know
for
a
space
it
seemed
that
this
fighting
had
lasted
for
an
age
and
must
needs
go
on
for
ever
then
suddenly
it
was
all
over
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
backs
of
heads
bobbing
up
and
down
as
their
owners
ran
in
all
directions
i
seemed
altogether
unhurt
i
ran
forward
some
paces
shouting
then
turned
about
i
was
amazed
i
had
come
right
through
them
in
vast
flying
strides
they
were
all
behind
me
and
running
hither
and
thither
to
hide
i
felt
an
enormous
astonishment
at
the
evaporation
of
the
great
fight
into
which
i
had
hurled
myself
and
not
a
little
exultation
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
i
had
discovered
the
selenites
were
unexpectedly
flimsy
but
that
i
was
unexpectedly
strong
i
laughed
stupidly
this
fantastic
moon
i
glanced
for
a
moment
at
the
smashed
and
writhing
bodies
that
were
scattered
over
the
cavern
floor
with
a
vague
idea
of
further
violence
then
hurried
on
after
cavor
xviii
in
the
sunlight
presently
we
saw
that
the
cavern
before
us
opened
upon
a
hazy
void
in
another
moment
we
had
emerged
upon
a
sort
of
slanting
gallery
that
projected
into
a
vast
circular
space
a
huge
cylindrical
pit
running
vertically
up
and
down
round
this
pit
the
slanting
gallery
ran
without
any
parapet
or
protection
for
a
turn
and
a
half
and
then
plunged
high
above
into
the
rock
again
somehow
it
reminded
me
then
of
one
of
those
spiral
turns
of
the
railway
through
the
saint
gothard
it
was
all
tremendously
huge
i
can
scarcely
hope
to
convey
to
you
the
titanic
proportion
of
all
that
place
the
titanic
effect
of
it
our
eyes
followed
up
the
vast
declivity
of
the
pit
wall
and
overhead
and
far
above
we
beheld
a
round
opening
set
with
faint
stars
and
half
of
the
lip
about
it
well
nigh
blinding
with
the
white
light
of
the
sun
at
that
we
cried
aloud
simultaneously
on
i
said
leading
the
way
there
said
cavor
and
very
carefully
stepped
nearer
the
edge
of
the
gallery
i
followed
his
example
and
craned
forward
and
looked
down
but
i
was
dazzled
by
that
gleam
of
light
above
and
i
could
see
only
a
bottomless
darkness
with
spectral
patches
of
crimson
and
purple
floating
therein
yet
if
i
could
not
see
i
could
hear
out
of
this
darkness
came
a
sound
a
sound
like
the
angry
hum
one
can
hear
if
one
puts
ear
outside
a
hive
of
bees
a
sound
out
of
that
enormous
hollow
it
may
be
four
miles
beneath
our
feet
for
a
moment
i
listened
then
tightened
my
grip
on
my
crowbar
and
led
the
way
up
the
gallery
must
be
the
shaft
we
looked
down
upon
said
cavor
that
below
there
is
where
we
saw
the
lights
said
he
lights
of
the
world
that
now
we
shall
never
come
back
i
said
for
now
we
had
escaped
so
much
i
was
rashly
sanguine
that
we
should
recover
the
sphere
his
answer
i
did
not
catch
i
asked
matter
he
answered
and
we
hurried
on
in
silence
i
suppose
that
slanting
lateral
way
was
four
or
five
miles
long
allowing
for
its
curvature
and
it
ascended
at
a
slope
that
would
have
made
it
almost
impossibly
steep
on
earth
but
which
one
strode
up
easily
under
lunar
conditions
we
saw
only
two
selenites
during
all
that
portion
of
our
flight
and
directly
they
became
aware
of
us
they
ran
headlong
it
was
clear
that
the
knowledge
of
our
strength
and
violence
had
reached
them
our
way
to
the
exterior
was
unexpectedly
plain
the
spiral
gallery
straightened
into
a
steeply
ascendent
tunnel
its
floor
bearing
abundant
traces
of
the
mooncalves
and
so
straight
and
short
in
proportion
to
its
vast
arch
that
no
part
of
it
was
absolutely
dark
almost
immediately
it
began
to
lighten
and
then
far
off
and
high
up
and
quite
blindingly
brilliant
appeared
its
opening
on
the
exterior
a
slope
of
alpine
steepness
surmounted
by
a
crest
of
bayonet
shrub
tall
and
broken
down
now
and
dry
and
dead
in
spiky
silhouette
against
the
sun
and
it
is
strange
that
we
men
to
whom
this
very
vegetation
had
seemed
so
weird
and
horrible
a
little
time
ago
should
now
behold
it
with
the
emotion
a
exile
might
feel
at
sight
of
his
native
land
we
welcomed
even
the
rareness
of
the
air
that
made
us
pant
as
we
ran
and
which
rendered
speaking
no
longer
the
easy
thing
that
it
had
been
but
an
effort
to
make
oneself
heard
larger
grew
the
sunlit
circle
above
us
and
larger
and
all
the
nearer
tunnel
sank
into
a
rim
of
indistinguishable
black
we
saw
the
dead
bayonet
shrub
no
longer
with
any
touch
of
green
in
it
but
brown
and
dry
and
thick
and
the
shadow
of
its
upper
branches
high
out
of
sight
made
a
densely
interlaced
pattern
upon
the
tumbled
rocks
and
at
the
immediate
mouth
of
the
tunnel
was
a
wide
trampled
space
where
the
mooncalves
had
come
and
gone
we
came
out
upon
this
space
at
last
into
a
light
and
heat
that
hit
and
pressed
upon
us
we
traversed
the
exposed
area
painfully
and
clambered
up
a
slope
among
the
scrub
stems
and
sat
down
at
last
panting
in
a
high
place
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
mass
of
twisted
lava
even
in
the
shade
the
rock
felt
hot
the
air
was
intensely
hot
and
we
were
in
great
physical
discomfort
but
for
all
that
we
were
no
longer
in
a
nightmare
we
seemed
to
have
come
to
our
own
province
again
beneath
the
stars
all
the
fear
and
stress
of
our
flight
through
the
dim
passages
and
fissures
below
had
fallen
from
us
that
last
fight
had
filled
us
with
an
enormous
confidence
in
ourselves
so
far
as
the
selenites
were
concerned
we
looked
back
almost
incredulously
at
the
black
opening
from
which
we
had
just
emerged
down
there
it
was
in
a
blue
glow
that
now
in
our
memories
seemed
the
next
thing
to
absolute
darkness
we
had
met
with
things
like
mad
mockeries
of
men
creatures
and
had
walked
in
fear
before
them
and
had
submitted
to
them
until
we
could
submit
no
longer
and
behold
they
had
smashed
like
wax
and
scattered
like
chaff
and
fled
and
vanished
like
the
creatures
of
a
dream
i
rubbed
my
eyes
doubting
whether
we
had
not
slept
and
dreamt
these
things
by
reason
of
the
fungus
we
had
eaten
and
suddenly
discovered
the
blood
upon
my
face
and
then
that
my
shirt
was
sticking
painfully
to
my
shoulder
and
arm
it
i
said
gauging
my
injuries
with
an
investigatory
hand
and
suddenly
that
distant
tunnel
mouth
became
as
it
were
a
watching
eye
i
said
are
they
going
to
do
now
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
he
shook
his
head
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
tunnel
can
one
tell
what
they
will
do
depends
on
what
they
think
of
us
and
i
see
how
we
can
begin
to
guess
that
and
it
depends
upon
what
they
have
in
reserve
as
you
say
cavor
we
have
touched
the
merest
outside
of
this
world
they
may
have
all
sorts
of
things
inside
here
even
with
those
shooting
things
they
might
make
it
bad
for
us
after
all
i
said
if
we
find
the
sphere
at
once
there
is
a
chance
for
us
we
might
hold
out
even
through
the
night
we
might
go
down
there
again
and
make
a
fight
for
i
stared
about
me
with
speculative
eyes
the
character
of
the
scenery
had
altered
altogether
by
reason
of
the
enormous
growth
and
subsequent
drying
of
the
scrub
the
crest
on
which
we
sat
was
high
and
commanded
a
wide
prospect
of
the
crater
landscape
and
we
saw
it
now
all
sere
and
dry
in
the
late
autumn
of
the
lunar
afternoon
rising
one
behind
the
other
were
long
slopes
and
fields
of
trampled
brown
where
the
mooncalves
had
pastured
and
far
away
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
a
drove
of
them
basked
slumberously
scattered
shapes
each
with
a
blot
of
shadow
against
it
like
sheep
on
the
side
of
a
down
but
never
a
sign
of
a
selenite
was
to
be
seen
whether
they
had
fled
on
our
emergence
from
the
interior
passages
or
whether
they
were
accustomed
to
retire
after
driving
out
the
mooncalves
i
can
not
guess
at
the
time
i
believed
the
former
was
the
case
we
were
to
set
fire
to
all
this
stuff
i
said
might
find
the
sphere
among
the
cavor
did
not
seem
to
hear
me
he
was
peering
under
his
hand
at
the
stars
that
still
in
spite
of
the
intense
sunlight
were
abundantly
visible
in
the
sky
long
do
you
think
have
been
here
he
asked
at
last
where
the
earthly
days
nearly
ten
do
you
know
the
sun
is
past
its
zenith
and
sinking
in
the
west
in
four
time
or
less
it
will
be
only
eaten
once
know
that
but
there
are
the
stars
why
should
time
seem
different
because
we
are
on
a
smaller
planet
know
there
it
is
does
one
tell
time
those
things
are
different
everything
is
to
me
it
seems
that
since
first
we
came
out
of
the
sphere
has
been
only
a
question
of
days
i
said
i
looked
up
at
the
sun
for
a
moment
and
then
saw
that
it
was
halfway
from
the
zenith
to
the
western
edge
of
things
days
cavor
we
sit
here
and
dream
how
do
you
think
we
may
begin
i
stood
up
must
get
a
fixed
point
we
can
might
hoist
a
flag
or
a
handkerchief
or
quarter
the
ground
and
work
round
he
stood
up
beside
me
he
said
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
hunt
the
sphere
nothing
we
may
find
we
may
find
it
and
if
must
keep
on
he
looked
this
way
and
that
glanced
up
at
the
sky
and
down
at
the
tunnel
and
astonished
me
by
a
sudden
gesture
of
impatience
but
we
have
done
foolishly
to
have
come
to
this
pass
think
how
it
might
have
been
and
the
things
we
might
have
done
might
do
something
the
thing
we
might
have
done
here
below
our
feet
is
a
world
think
of
what
that
world
must
be
think
of
that
machine
we
saw
and
the
lid
and
the
shaft
they
were
just
remote
outlying
things
and
those
creatures
we
have
seen
and
fought
with
no
more
than
ignorant
peasants
dwellers
in
the
outskirts
yokels
and
labourers
half
akin
to
brutes
down
below
caverns
beneath
caverns
tunnels
structures
ways
it
must
open
out
and
be
greater
and
wider
and
more
populous
as
one
descends
assuredly
right
down
at
the
last
the
central
sea
that
washes
round
the
core
of
the
moon
think
of
its
inky
waters
under
the
spare
indeed
their
eyes
lights
think
of
the
cascading
tributaries
pouring
down
their
channels
to
feed
it
think
of
the
tides
upon
its
surface
and
the
rush
and
swirl
of
its
ebb
and
flow
perhaps
they
have
ships
that
go
upon
it
perhaps
down
there
are
mighty
cities
and
swarming
ways
and
wisdom
and
order
passing
the
wit
of
man
and
we
may
die
here
upon
it
and
never
see
the
masters
who
over
these
things
we
may
freeze
and
die
here
and
the
air
will
freeze
and
thaw
upon
us
and
then
they
will
come
upon
us
come
on
our
stiff
and
silent
bodies
and
find
the
sphere
we
can
not
find
and
they
will
understand
at
last
too
late
all
the
thought
and
effort
that
ended
here
in
vain
his
voice
for
all
that
speech
sounded
like
the
voice
of
someone
heard
in
a
telephone
weak
and
far
away
the
darkness
i
said
might
get
over
know
how
am
i
to
know
one
might
carry
a
torch
one
might
have
a
the
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
hands
held
down
and
a
rueful
face
staring
out
over
the
waste
that
defied
him
then
with
a
gesture
of
renunciation
he
turned
towards
me
with
proposals
for
the
systematic
hunting
of
the
sphere
can
return
i
said
he
looked
about
him
of
all
we
shall
have
to
get
to
could
bring
back
lamps
to
carry
and
climbing
irons
and
a
hundred
necessary
he
said
can
take
back
an
earnest
of
success
in
this
he
looked
at
my
golden
crowbars
and
said
nothing
for
a
space
he
stood
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
staring
across
the
crater
at
last
he
signed
and
spoke
was
found
the
way
here
but
to
find
a
way
always
to
be
master
of
a
way
if
i
take
my
secret
back
to
earth
what
will
happen
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
keep
my
secret
for
a
year
for
even
a
part
of
a
year
sooner
or
later
it
must
come
out
even
if
other
men
rediscover
it
and
then
governments
and
powers
will
struggle
to
get
hither
they
will
fight
against
one
another
and
against
these
moon
people
it
will
only
spread
warfare
and
multiply
the
occasions
of
war
in
a
little
while
in
a
very
little
while
if
i
tell
my
secret
this
planet
to
its
deepest
galleries
will
be
strewn
with
human
dead
other
things
are
doubtful
but
that
is
certain
it
is
not
as
though
man
had
any
use
for
the
moon
what
good
would
the
moon
be
to
men
even
of
their
own
planet
what
have
they
made
but
a
and
theatre
of
infinite
folly
small
as
his
world
is
and
short
as
his
time
he
has
still
in
his
little
life
down
there
far
more
than
he
can
do
no
science
has
toiled
too
long
forging
weapons
for
fools
to
use
it
is
time
she
held
her
hand
let
him
find
it
out
for
himself
a
thousand
are
methods
of
secrecy
i
said
he
looked
up
at
me
and
smiled
all
he
said
should
one
worry
there
is
little
chance
of
our
finding
the
sphere
and
down
below
things
are
brewing
simply
the
human
habit
of
hoping
till
we
die
that
makes
us
think
of
return
our
troubles
are
only
beginning
we
have
shown
these
moon
folk
violence
we
have
given
them
a
taste
of
our
quality
and
our
chances
are
about
as
good
as
a
that
has
got
loose
and
killed
a
man
in
hyde
park
the
news
of
us
must
be
running
down
from
gallery
to
gallery
down
towards
the
central
parts
no
sane
beings
will
ever
let
us
take
that
sphere
back
to
earth
after
so
much
as
they
have
seen
of
improving
our
chances
said
i
sitting
we
stood
up
side
by
side
all
he
said
must
separate
we
must
stick
up
a
handkerchief
on
these
tall
spikes
here
and
fasten
it
firmly
and
from
this
as
a
centre
we
must
work
over
the
crater
you
must
go
westward
moving
out
in
semicircles
to
and
fro
towards
the
setting
sun
you
must
move
first
with
your
shadow
on
your
right
until
it
is
at
right
angles
with
the
direction
of
your
handkerchief
and
then
with
your
shadow
on
your
left
and
i
will
do
the
same
to
the
east
we
will
look
into
every
gully
examine
every
skerry
of
rocks
we
will
do
all
we
can
to
find
my
sphere
if
we
see
the
selenites
we
will
hide
from
them
as
well
as
we
can
for
drink
we
must
take
snow
and
if
we
feel
the
need
of
food
we
must
kill
a
mooncalf
if
we
can
and
eat
such
flesh
as
it
so
each
will
go
his
own
if
one
of
us
comes
upon
the
sphere
must
come
back
to
the
white
handkerchief
and
stand
by
it
and
signal
to
the
if
neither
cavor
glanced
up
at
the
sun
go
on
seeking
until
the
night
and
cold
overtake
the
selenites
have
found
the
sphere
and
hidden
it
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
presently
they
come
hunting
us
he
made
no
answer
had
better
take
a
club
i
said
he
shook
his
head
and
stared
away
from
me
across
the
waste
but
for
a
moment
he
did
not
start
he
looked
round
at
me
shyly
hesitated
he
said
i
felt
an
odd
stab
of
emotion
a
sense
of
how
we
had
galled
each
other
and
particularly
how
i
must
have
galled
him
came
to
me
it
thought
i
might
have
done
better
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
to
shake
that
somehow
was
how
i
felt
just
he
put
his
feet
together
and
leapt
away
from
me
towards
the
north
he
seemed
to
drift
through
the
air
as
a
dead
leaf
would
do
fell
lightly
and
leapt
again
i
stood
for
a
moment
watching
him
then
faced
westward
reluctantly
pulled
myself
together
and
with
something
of
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
leaps
into
icy
water
selected
a
leaping
point
and
plunged
forward
to
explore
my
solitary
half
of
the
moon
world
i
dropped
rather
clumsily
among
rocks
stood
up
and
looked
about
me
clambered
on
to
a
rocky
slab
and
leapt
again
when
presently
i
looked
for
cavor
he
was
hidden
from
my
eyes
but
the
handkerchief
showed
out
bravely
on
its
headland
white
in
the
blaze
of
the
sun
i
determined
not
to
lose
sight
of
that
handkerchief
whatever
might
betide
xix
bedford
alone
in
a
little
while
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
had
always
been
alone
on
the
moon
i
hunted
for
a
time
with
a
certain
intentness
but
the
heat
was
still
very
great
and
the
thinness
of
the
air
felt
like
a
hoop
about
chest
i
came
presently
into
a
hollow
basin
bristling
with
tall
brown
dry
fronds
about
its
edge
and
i
sat
down
under
these
to
rest
and
cool
i
intended
to
rest
for
only
a
little
while
i
put
down
my
clubs
beside
me
and
sat
resting
my
chin
on
my
hands
i
saw
with
a
sort
of
colourless
interest
that
the
rocks
of
the
basin
where
here
and
there
the
crackling
dry
lichens
had
shrunk
away
to
show
them
were
all
veined
and
splattered
with
gold
that
here
and
there
bosses
of
rounded
and
wrinkled
gold
projected
from
among
the
litter
what
did
that
matter
now
a
sort
of
languor
had
possession
of
my
limbs
and
mind
i
did
not
believe
for
a
moment
that
we
should
ever
find
the
sphere
in
that
vast
desiccated
wilderness
i
seemed
to
lack
a
motive
for
effort
until
the
selenites
should
come
then
i
supposed
i
should
exert
myself
obeying
that
unreasonable
imperative
that
urges
a
man
before
all
things
to
preserve
and
defend
his
life
albeit
he
may
preserve
it
only
to
die
more
painfully
in
a
little
while
why
had
we
come
to
the
moon
the
thing
presented
itself
to
me
as
a
perplexing
problem
what
is
this
spirit
in
man
that
urges
him
for
ever
to
depart
from
happiness
and
security
to
toil
to
place
himself
in
danger
to
risk
even
a
reasonable
certainty
of
death
it
dawned
upon
me
up
there
in
the
moon
as
a
thing
i
ought
always
to
have
known
that
man
is
not
made
simply
to
go
about
being
safe
and
comfortable
and
well
fed
and
amused
almost
any
man
if
you
put
the
thing
to
him
not
in
words
but
in
the
shape
of
opportunities
will
show
that
he
knows
as
much
against
his
interest
against
his
happiness
he
is
constantly
being
driven
to
do
unreasonable
things
some
force
not
himself
impels
him
and
go
he
must
but
why
why
sitting
there
in
the
midst
of
that
useless
moon
gold
amidst
the
things
of
another
world
i
took
count
of
all
my
life
assuming
i
was
to
die
a
castaway
upon
the
moon
i
failed
altogether
to
see
what
purpose
i
had
served
i
got
no
light
on
that
point
but
at
any
rate
it
was
clearer
to
me
than
it
had
ever
been
in
my
life
before
that
i
was
not
serving
my
own
purpose
that
all
my
life
i
had
in
truth
never
served
the
purposes
of
my
private
life
whose
purposes
what
purposes
was
i
serving
i
ceased
to
speculate
on
why
we
had
come
to
the
moon
and
took
a
wider
sweep
why
had
i
come
to
the
earth
why
had
i
a
private
life
at
all
i
lost
myself
at
last
in
bottomless
speculations
my
thoughts
became
vague
and
cloudy
no
longer
leading
in
definite
directions
i
had
not
felt
heavy
or
can
not
imagine
one
doing
so
upon
the
i
suppose
i
was
greatly
fatigued
at
any
rate
i
slept
slumbering
there
rested
me
greatly
i
think
and
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
violence
of
the
heat
abating
through
all
the
time
i
slumbered
when
at
last
i
was
roused
from
my
slumbers
by
a
remote
clamour
i
felt
active
and
capable
again
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
stretched
my
arms
i
rose
to
my
was
a
little
at
once
prepared
to
resume
my
search
i
shouldered
my
golden
clubs
one
on
each
shoulder
and
went
on
out
of
the
ravine
of
the
rocks
the
sun
was
certainly
lower
much
lower
than
it
had
been
the
air
was
very
much
cooler
i
perceived
i
must
have
slept
some
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
faint
touch
of
misty
blueness
hung
about
the
western
cliff
i
leapt
to
a
little
boss
of
rock
and
surveyed
the
crater
i
could
see
no
signs
of
mooncalves
or
selenites
nor
could
i
see
cavor
but
i
could
see
my
handkerchief
far
off
spread
out
on
its
thicket
of
thorns
i
looked
about
me
and
then
leapt
forward
to
the
next
convenient
i
beat
my
way
round
in
a
semicircle
and
back
again
in
a
still
remoter
crescent
it
was
very
fatiguing
and
hopeless
the
air
was
really
very
much
cooler
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
shadow
under
the
westward
cliff
was
growing
broad
ever
and
again
i
stopped
and
reconnoitred
but
there
was
no
sign
of
cavor
no
sign
of
selenites
and
it
seemed
to
me
the
mooncalves
must
have
been
driven
into
the
interior
could
see
none
of
them
i
became
more
and
more
desirous
of
seeing
cavor
the
winged
outline
of
the
sun
had
sunk
now
until
it
was
scarcely
the
distance
of
its
diameter
from
the
rim
of
the
sky
i
was
oppressed
by
the
idea
that
the
selenites
would
presently
close
their
lids
and
valves
and
shut
us
out
under
the
inexorable
onrush
of
the
lunar
night
it
seemed
to
me
high
time
that
he
abandoned
his
search
and
that
we
took
counsel
together
i
felt
how
urgent
it
was
that
we
should
decide
soon
upon
our
course
we
had
failed
to
find
the
sphere
we
no
longer
had
time
to
seek
it
and
once
these
valves
were
closed
with
us
outside
we
were
lost
men
the
great
night
of
space
would
descend
upon
blackness
of
the
void
which
is
the
only
absolute
death
all
my
being
shrank
from
that
approach
we
must
get
into
the
moon
again
though
we
were
slain
in
doing
it
i
was
haunted
by
a
vision
of
our
freezing
to
death
of
our
hammering
with
our
last
strength
on
the
valve
of
the
great
pit
i
took
no
thought
any
more
of
the
sphere
i
thought
only
of
finding
cavor
again
i
was
half
inclined
to
go
back
into
the
moon
without
him
rather
than
seek
him
until
it
was
too
late
i
was
already
back
towards
our
handkerchief
when
i
saw
the
sphere
i
did
not
find
it
so
much
as
it
found
me
it
was
lying
much
farther
to
the
westward
than
i
had
gone
and
the
sloping
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
reflected
from
its
glass
had
suddenly
proclaimed
its
presence
in
a
dazzling
beam
for
an
instant
i
thought
this
was
some
new
device
of
the
selenites
against
us
and
then
i
understood
i
threw
up
my
arms
shouted
a
ghostly
shout
and
set
off
in
vast
leaps
towards
it
i
missed
one
of
my
leaps
and
dropped
into
a
deep
ravine
and
twisted
my
ankle
and
after
that
i
stumbled
at
almost
every
leap
i
was
in
a
state
of
hysterical
agitation
trembling
violently
and
quite
breathless
long
before
i
got
to
it
three
times
at
least
i
had
to
stop
with
my
hands
resting
on
my
side
and
in
spite
of
the
thin
dryness
of
the
air
the
perspiration
was
wet
upon
my
face
i
thought
of
nothing
but
the
sphere
until
i
reached
it
i
forgot
even
my
trouble
of
whereabouts
my
last
leap
flung
me
with
my
hands
hard
against
its
glass
then
i
lay
against
it
panting
and
trying
vainly
to
shout
here
is
the
sphere
when
i
had
recovered
a
little
i
peered
through
the
thick
glass
and
the
things
inside
seemed
tumbled
i
stooped
to
peer
closer
then
i
attempted
to
get
in
i
had
to
hoist
it
over
a
little
to
get
my
head
through
the
manhole
the
screw
stopper
was
inside
and
i
could
see
now
that
nothing
had
been
touched
nothing
had
suffered
it
lay
there
as
we
had
left
it
when
we
had
dropped
out
amidst
the
snow
for
a
time
i
was
wholly
occupied
in
making
and
remaking
this
inventory
i
found
i
was
trembling
violently
it
was
good
to
see
that
familiar
dark
interior
again
i
can
not
tell
you
how
good
presently
i
crept
inside
and
sat
down
among
the
things
i
looked
through
the
glass
at
the
moon
world
and
shivered
i
placed
my
gold
clubs
upon
the
table
and
sought
out
and
took
a
little
food
not
so
much
because
i
wanted
it
but
because
it
was
there
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
time
to
go
out
and
signal
for
cavor
but
i
did
not
go
out
and
signal
for
cavor
forthwith
something
held
me
to
the
sphere
after
all
everything
was
coming
right
there
would
be
still
time
for
us
to
get
more
of
the
magic
stone
that
gives
one
mastery
over
men
away
there
close
handy
was
gold
for
the
picking
up
and
the
sphere
would
travel
as
well
half
full
of
gold
as
though
it
were
empty
we
could
go
back
now
masters
of
ourselves
and
our
world
and
i
roused
myself
at
last
and
with
an
effort
got
myself
out
of
the
sphere
i
shivered
as
i
emerged
for
the
evening
air
was
growing
very
cold
i
stood
in
the
hollow
staring
about
me
i
scrutinised
the
bushes
round
me
very
carefully
before
i
leapt
to
the
rocky
shelf
hard
by
and
took
once
more
what
had
been
my
first
leap
in
the
moon
but
now
i
made
it
with
no
effort
whatever
the
growth
and
decay
of
the
vegetation
had
gone
on
apace
and
the
whole
aspect
of
the
rocks
had
changed
but
still
it
was
possible
to
make
out
the
slope
on
which
the
seeds
had
germinated
and
the
rocky
mass
from
which
we
had
taken
our
first
view
of
the
crater
but
the
spiky
shrub
on
the
slope
stood
brown
and
sere
now
and
thirty
feet
high
and
cast
long
shadows
that
stretched
out
of
sight
and
the
little
seeds
that
clustered
in
its
upper
branches
were
brown
and
ripe
its
work
was
done
and
it
was
brittle
and
ready
to
fall
and
crumple
under
the
freezing
air
so
soon
as
the
nightfall
came
and
the
huge
cacti
that
had
swollen
as
we
watched
them
had
long
since
burst
and
scattered
their
spores
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
moon
amazing
little
corner
in
the
landing
place
of
men
some
day
thought
i
i
will
have
an
inscription
standing
there
right
in
the
midst
of
the
hollow
it
came
to
me
if
only
this
teeming
world
within
knew
of
the
full
import
of
the
moment
how
furious
its
tumult
would
become
but
as
yet
it
could
scarcely
be
dreaming
of
the
significance
of
our
coming
for
if
it
did
the
crater
would
surely
be
an
uproar
of
pursuit
instead
of
as
still
as
death
i
looked
about
for
some
place
from
which
i
might
signal
cavor
and
saw
that
same
patch
of
rock
to
which
he
had
leapt
from
my
present
standpoint
still
bare
and
barren
in
the
sun
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
at
going
so
far
from
the
sphere
then
with
a
pang
of
shame
at
that
hesitation
i
leapt
from
this
vantage
point
i
surveyed
the
crater
again
far
away
at
the
top
of
the
enormous
shadow
i
cast
was
the
little
white
handkerchief
fluttering
on
the
bushes
it
was
very
little
and
very
far
and
cavor
was
not
in
sight
it
seemed
to
me
that
by
this
time
he
ought
to
be
looking
for
me
that
was
the
agreement
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
stood
waiting
and
watching
hands
shading
my
eyes
expecting
every
moment
to
distinguish
him
very
probably
i
stood
there
for
quite
a
long
time
i
tried
to
shout
and
was
reminded
of
the
thinness
of
the
air
i
made
an
undecided
step
back
towards
the
sphere
but
a
lurking
dread
of
the
selenites
made
me
hesitate
to
signal
my
whereabouts
by
hoisting
one
of
our
on
to
the
adjacent
scrub
i
searched
the
crater
again
it
had
an
effect
of
emptiness
that
chilled
me
and
it
was
still
any
sound
from
the
selenites
in
the
world
beneath
had
died
away
it
was
as
still
as
death
save
for
the
faint
stir
of
the
shrub
about
me
in
the
little
breeze
that
was
rising
there
was
no
sound
nor
shadow
of
a
sound
and
the
breeze
blew
chill
confound
cavor
i
took
a
deep
breath
i
put
my
hands
to
the
sides
of
my
mouth
i
bawled
and
the
sound
was
like
some
manikin
shouting
far
away
i
looked
at
the
handkerchief
i
looked
behind
me
at
the
broadening
shadow
of
the
westward
cliff
i
looked
under
my
hand
at
the
sun
it
seemed
to
me
that
almost
visibly
it
was
creeping
down
the
sky
i
felt
i
must
act
instantly
if
i
was
to
save
cavor
i
whipped
off
my
vest
and
flung
it
as
a
mark
on
the
sere
bayonets
of
the
shrubs
behind
me
and
then
set
off
in
a
straight
line
towards
the
handkerchief
perhaps
it
was
a
couple
of
miles
matter
of
a
few
hundred
leaps
and
strides
i
have
already
told
how
one
seemed
to
hang
through
those
lunar
leaps
in
each
suspense
i
sought
cavor
and
marvelled
why
he
should
be
hidden
in
each
leap
i
could
feel
the
sun
setting
behind
me
each
time
i
touched
the
ground
i
was
tempted
to
go
back
a
last
leap
and
i
was
in
the
depression
below
our
handkerchief
a
stride
and
i
stood
on
our
former
vantage
point
within
reach
of
it
i
stood
up
straight
and
scanned
the
world
about
me
between
its
lengthening
bars
of
shadow
far
away
down
a
long
declivity
was
the
opening
of
the
tunnel
up
which
we
had
fled
and
my
shadow
reached
towards
it
stretched
towards
it
and
touched
it
like
a
finger
of
the
night
not
a
sign
of
cavor
not
a
sound
in
all
the
stillness
only
the
stir
and
waving
of
the
scrub
and
of
the
shadows
increased
and
suddenly
and
violently
i
shivered
i
began
and
realised
once
more
the
uselessness
of
the
human
voice
in
that
thin
air
silence
the
silence
of
death
then
it
was
my
eye
caught
little
thing
lying
perhaps
fifty
yards
away
down
the
slope
amidst
a
litter
of
bent
and
broken
branches
what
was
it
i
knew
and
yet
for
some
reason
i
would
not
know
i
went
nearer
to
it
it
was
the
little
cavor
had
worn
i
did
not
touch
it
i
stood
looking
at
it
i
saw
then
that
the
scattered
branches
about
it
had
been
forcibly
smashed
and
trampled
i
hesitated
stepped
forward
and
picked
it
up
i
stood
with
cap
in
my
hand
staring
at
the
trampled
reeds
and
thorns
about
me
on
some
of
them
were
little
smears
of
something
dark
something
that
i
dared
not
touch
a
dozen
yards
away
perhaps
the
rising
breeze
dragged
something
into
view
something
small
and
vividly
white
it
was
a
little
piece
of
paper
crumpled
tightly
as
though
it
had
been
clutched
tightly
i
picked
it
up
and
on
it
were
smears
of
red
my
eye
caught
faint
pencil
marks
i
smoothed
it
out
and
saw
uneven
and
broken
writing
ending
at
last
in
a
crooked
streak
upon
the
paper
i
set
myself
to
decipher
this
have
been
injured
about
the
knee
i
think
my
kneecap
is
hurt
and
i
can
not
run
or
crawl
it
distinctly
written
then
less
legibly
have
been
chasing
me
for
some
time
and
it
is
only
a
question
word
seemed
to
have
been
written
here
and
erased
in
favour
of
something
they
get
me
they
are
beating
all
about
then
the
writing
became
convulsive
can
hear
them
i
guessed
the
tracing
meant
and
then
it
was
quite
unreadable
for
a
space
then
came
a
little
string
of
words
that
were
quite
distinct
different
sort
of
selenite
altogether
who
appears
to
be
directing
the
writing
became
a
mere
hasty
confusion
again
have
larger
brain
larger
and
slenderer
bodies
and
very
short
legs
they
make
gentle
noises
and
move
with
organized
deliberation
though
i
am
wounded
and
helpless
here
their
appearance
still
gives
me
that
was
like
cavor
have
not
shot
at
me
or
attempted
injury
i
then
came
the
sudden
streak
of
the
pencil
across
the
paper
and
on
the
back
and
and
as
i
stood
there
stupid
and
perplexed
with
this
dumbfounding
relic
in
my
hand
something
very
soft
and
light
and
chill
touched
my
hand
for
a
moment
and
ceased
to
be
and
then
a
thing
a
little
white
speck
drifted
athwart
a
shadow
it
was
a
tiny
snowflake
the
first
snowflake
the
herald
of
the
night
i
looked
up
with
a
start
and
the
sky
had
darkened
almost
to
blackness
and
was
thick
with
a
gathering
multitude
of
coldly
watchful
stars
i
looked
eastward
and
the
light
of
that
shrivelled
world
was
touched
with
sombre
bronze
westward
and
the
sun
robbed
now
by
a
thickening
white
mist
of
half
its
heat
and
splendour
was
touching
the
crater
rim
was
sinking
out
of
sight
and
all
the
shrubs
and
jagged
and
tumbled
rocks
stood
out
against
it
in
a
bristling
disorder
of
black
shapes
into
the
great
lake
of
darkness
westward
a
vast
wreath
of
mist
was
sinking
a
cold
wind
set
all
the
crater
shivering
suddenly
for
a
moment
i
was
in
a
puff
of
falling
snow
and
all
the
world
about
me
grey
and
dim
and
then
it
was
i
heard
not
loud
and
penetrating
as
at
first
but
faint
and
dim
like
a
dying
voice
that
tolling
that
same
tolling
that
had
welcomed
the
coming
of
the
day
boom
boom
boom
it
echoed
about
the
crater
it
seemed
to
throb
with
the
throbbing
of
the
greater
stars
the
crescent
of
the
disc
sank
as
it
tolled
out
boom
boom
boom
what
had
happened
to
cavor
all
through
that
tolling
i
stood
there
stupidly
and
at
last
the
tolling
ceased
and
suddenly
the
open
mouth
of
the
tunnel
down
below
there
shut
like
an
eye
and
vanished
out
of
sight
then
indeed
was
i
alone
over
me
around
me
closing
in
on
me
embracing
me
ever
nearer
was
the
eternal
that
which
was
before
the
beginning
and
that
which
triumphs
over
the
end
that
enormous
void
in
which
all
light
and
life
and
being
is
but
the
thin
and
vanishing
splendour
of
a
falling
star
the
cold
the
stillness
the
infinite
and
final
night
of
space
the
sense
of
solitude
and
desolation
became
the
sense
of
an
overwhelming
presence
that
stooped
towards
me
that
almost
touched
me
i
cried
not
yet
not
yet
wait
wait
oh
wait
my
voice
went
up
to
a
shriek
i
flung
the
crumpled
paper
from
me
scrambled
back
to
the
crest
to
take
my
bearings
and
then
with
all
the
will
that
was
in
me
leapt
out
towards
the
mark
i
had
left
dim
and
distant
now
in
the
very
margin
of
the
shadow
leap
leap
leap
and
each
leap
was
seven
ages
before
me
the
pale
section
of
the
sun
sank
and
sank
and
the
advancing
shadow
swept
to
seize
the
sphere
before
i
could
reach
it
i
was
two
miles
away
a
hundred
leaps
or
more
and
the
air
about
me
was
thinning
out
as
it
thins
under
an
and
the
cold
was
gripping
at
my
joints
but
had
i
died
i
should
have
died
leaping
once
and
then
again
my
foot
slipped
on
the
gathering
snow
as
i
leapt
and
shortened
my
leap
once
i
fell
short
into
bushes
that
crashed
and
smashed
into
dusty
chips
and
nothingness
and
once
i
stumbled
as
i
dropped
and
rolled
head
over
heels
into
a
gully
and
rose
bruised
and
bleeding
and
confused
as
to
my
direction
but
such
incidents
were
as
nothing
to
the
intervals
those
awful
pauses
when
one
drifted
through
the
air
towards
that
pouring
tide
of
night
my
breathing
made
a
piping
noise
and
it
was
as
though
knives
were
whirling
in
my
lungs
my
heart
seemed
to
beat
against
the
top
of
my
brain
i
reach
it
o
heaven
shall
i
reach
it
my
whole
being
became
anguish
down
screamed
my
pain
and
despair
down
the
nearer
i
struggled
the
more
awfully
remote
it
seemed
i
was
numb
i
stumbled
i
bruised
and
cut
myself
and
did
not
bleed
it
was
in
sight
i
fell
on
all
fours
and
my
lungs
whooped
i
crawled
the
frost
gathered
on
my
lips
icicles
hung
from
my
moustache
i
was
white
with
the
freezing
atmosphere
i
was
a
dozen
yards
from
it
my
eyes
had
become
dim
down
screamed
despair
down
i
touched
it
and
halted
late
screamed
despair
down
i
fought
stiffly
with
it
i
was
on
the
manhole
lip
a
stupefied
being
the
snow
was
all
about
me
i
pulled
myself
in
there
lurked
within
a
little
warmer
air
the
in
about
me
as
i
tried
with
chilling
hands
to
thrust
the
valve
in
and
spun
it
tight
and
hard
i
sobbed
will
i
chattered
in
my
teeth
and
then
with
fingers
that
quivered
and
felt
brittle
i
turned
to
the
shutter
studs
as
i
fumbled
with
the
i
had
never
controlled
them
could
see
dimly
through
the
steaming
glass
the
blazing
red
streamers
of
the
sinking
sun
dancing
and
flickering
through
the
snowstorm
and
the
black
forms
of
the
scrub
thickening
and
bending
and
breaking
beneath
the
accumulating
snow
thicker
whirled
the
snow
and
thicker
black
against
the
light
what
if
even
now
the
switches
overcame
me
then
something
clicked
under
my
hands
and
in
an
instant
that
last
vision
of
the
moon
world
was
hidden
from
my
eyes
i
was
in
the
silence
and
darkness
of
the
sphere
xx
bedford
in
infinite
space
it
was
almost
as
though
i
had
been
killed
indeed
i
could
imagine
a
man
suddenly
and
violently
killed
would
feel
very
much
as
i
did
one
moment
a
passion
of
agonising
existence
and
fear
the
next
darkness
and
stillness
neither
light
nor
life
nor
sun
moon
nor
stars
the
blank
infinite
although
the
thing
was
done
by
my
own
act
although
i
had
already
tasted
this
very
of
effect
in
company
i
felt
astonished
dumbfounded
and
overwhelmed
i
seemed
to
be
borne
upward
into
an
enormous
darkness
my
fingers
floated
off
the
studs
i
hung
as
if
i
were
annihilated
and
at
last
very
softly
and
gently
i
came
against
the
bale
and
the
golden
chain
and
the
crowbars
that
had
drifted
to
the
middle
of
the
sphere
i
do
not
know
how
long
that
drifting
took
in
the
sphere
of
course
even
more
than
on
the
moon
earthly
time
sense
was
ineffectual
at
the
touch
of
the
bale
it
was
as
if
i
had
awakened
from
a
dreamless
sleep
i
immediately
perceived
that
if
i
wanted
to
keep
awake
and
alive
i
must
get
a
light
or
open
a
window
so
as
to
get
a
grip
of
something
with
my
eyes
and
besides
i
was
cold
i
kicked
off
from
the
bale
therefore
clawed
on
to
the
thin
cords
within
the
glass
crawled
along
until
i
got
to
the
manhole
rim
and
so
got
my
bearings
for
the
light
and
blind
studs
took
a
shove
off
and
flying
once
round
the
bale
and
getting
a
scare
from
something
big
and
flimsy
that
was
drifting
loose
i
got
my
hand
on
the
cord
quite
close
to
the
studs
and
reached
them
i
lit
the
little
lamp
first
of
all
to
see
what
it
was
i
had
collided
with
and
discovered
that
old
copy
of
had
slipped
its
moorings
and
was
adrift
in
the
void
that
brought
me
out
of
the
infinite
to
my
own
proper
dimensions
again
it
made
me
laugh
and
pant
for
a
time
and
suggested
the
idea
of
a
little
oxygen
from
one
of
the
cylinders
after
that
i
lit
the
heater
until
i
felt
warm
and
then
i
took
food
then
i
set
to
work
in
a
very
gingerly
fashion
on
the
cavorite
blinds
to
see
if
i
could
guess
by
any
means
how
the
sphere
was
travelling
the
first
blind
i
opened
i
shut
at
once
and
hung
for
a
time
flattened
and
blinded
by
the
sunlight
that
had
hit
me
after
thinking
a
little
i
started
upon
the
windows
at
right
angles
to
this
one
and
got
the
huge
crescent
moon
and
the
little
crescent
earth
behind
it
the
second
time
i
was
amazed
to
find
how
far
i
was
from
the
moon
i
had
reckoned
that
not
only
should
i
have
little
or
none
of
the
that
the
atmosphere
had
given
us
at
our
start
but
that
the
tangential
of
the
spin
would
be
at
least
times
less
than
the
i
had
expected
to
discover
myself
hanging
over
our
crater
and
on
the
edge
of
the
night
but
all
that
was
now
only
a
part
of
the
outline
of
the
white
crescent
that
filled
the
sky
and
he
was
already
infinitesimal
i
tried
to
imagine
what
could
have
happened
to
him
but
at
that
time
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
death
i
seemed
to
see
him
bent
and
smashed
at
the
foot
of
some
interminably
high
cascade
of
blue
and
all
about
him
the
stupid
insects
stared
under
the
inspiring
touch
of
the
drifting
newspaper
i
became
practical
again
for
a
while
it
was
quite
clear
to
me
that
what
i
had
to
do
was
to
get
back
to
earth
but
as
far
as
i
could
see
i
was
drifting
away
from
it
whatever
had
happened
to
cavor
even
if
he
was
still
alive
which
seemed
to
me
incredible
after
that
scrap
i
was
powerless
to
help
him
there
he
was
living
or
dead
behind
the
mantle
of
that
rayless
night
and
there
he
must
remain
at
least
until
i
could
summon
our
fellow
men
to
his
assistance
should
i
do
that
something
of
the
sort
i
had
in
my
mind
to
come
back
to
earth
if
it
were
possible
and
then
as
maturer
consideration
might
determine
either
to
show
and
explain
the
sphere
to
a
few
discreet
persons
and
act
with
them
or
else
to
keep
my
secret
sell
my
gold
obtain
weapons
provisions
and
an
assistant
and
return
with
these
advantages
to
deal
on
equal
terms
with
the
flimsy
people
of
the
moon
to
rescue
cavor
if
that
were
still
possible
and
at
any
rate
to
procure
a
sufficient
supply
of
gold
to
place
my
subsequent
proceedings
on
a
firmer
basis
but
that
was
hoping
far
i
had
first
to
get
back
i
set
myself
to
decide
just
exactly
how
the
return
to
earth
could
be
contrived
as
i
struggled
with
that
problem
i
ceased
to
worry
about
what
i
should
do
when
i
got
there
at
last
my
only
care
was
to
get
back
i
puzzled
out
at
last
that
my
best
chance
would
be
to
drop
back
towards
the
moon
as
near
as
i
dared
in
order
to
gather
velocity
then
to
shut
my
windows
and
fly
behind
it
and
when
i
was
past
to
open
my
earthward
windows
and
so
get
off
at
a
good
pace
homeward
but
whether
i
should
ever
reach
the
earth
by
that
device
or
whether
i
might
not
simply
find
myself
spinning
about
it
in
some
hyperbolic
or
parabolic
curve
or
other
i
could
not
tell
later
i
had
a
happy
inspiration
and
by
opening
certain
windows
to
the
moon
which
had
appeared
in
the
sky
in
front
of
the
earth
i
turned
my
course
aside
so
as
to
head
off
the
earth
which
it
had
become
evident
to
me
i
must
pass
behind
without
some
such
expedient
i
did
a
very
great
deal
of
complicated
thinking
over
these
i
am
no
in
the
end
i
am
certain
it
was
much
more
my
good
luck
than
my
reasoning
that
enabled
me
to
hit
the
earth
had
i
known
then
as
i
know
now
the
mathematical
chances
there
were
against
me
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
troubled
even
to
touch
the
studs
to
make
any
attempt
and
having
puzzled
out
what
i
considered
to
be
the
thing
to
do
i
opened
all
my
moonward
windows
and
squatted
effort
lifted
me
for
a
time
some
feet
or
so
into
the
air
and
i
hung
there
in
the
oddest
waited
for
the
crescent
to
get
bigger
and
bigger
until
i
felt
i
was
near
enough
for
safety
then
i
would
shut
the
windows
fly
past
the
moon
with
the
velocity
i
had
got
from
i
did
not
smash
upon
so
go
on
towards
the
earth
and
that
is
what
i
did
at
last
i
felt
my
moonward
start
was
sufficient
i
shut
out
the
sight
of
the
moon
from
my
eyes
and
in
a
state
of
mind
that
was
i
now
recall
incredibly
free
from
anxiety
or
any
distressful
quality
i
sat
down
to
begin
a
vigil
in
that
little
speck
of
matter
in
infinite
space
that
would
last
until
i
should
strike
the
earth
the
heater
had
made
the
sphere
tolerably
warm
the
air
had
been
refreshed
by
the
oxygen
and
except
for
that
faint
congestion
of
the
head
that
was
always
with
me
while
i
was
away
from
earth
i
felt
entire
physical
comfort
i
had
extinguished
the
light
again
lest
it
should
fail
me
in
the
end
i
was
in
darkness
save
for
the
earthshine
and
the
glitter
of
the
stars
below
me
everything
was
so
absolutely
silent
and
still
that
i
might
indeed
have
been
the
only
being
in
the
universe
and
yet
strangely
enough
i
had
no
more
feeling
of
loneliness
or
fear
than
if
i
had
been
lying
in
bed
on
earth
now
this
seems
all
the
stranger
to
me
since
during
my
last
hours
in
that
crater
of
the
moon
the
sense
of
my
utter
loneliness
had
been
an
agony
incredible
as
it
will
seem
this
interval
of
time
that
i
spent
in
space
has
no
sort
of
proportion
to
any
other
interval
of
time
in
my
life
sometimes
it
seemed
as
though
i
sat
through
immeasurable
eternities
like
some
god
upon
a
lotus
leaf
and
again
as
though
there
was
a
momentary
pause
as
i
leapt
from
moon
to
earth
in
truth
it
was
altogether
some
weeks
of
earthly
time
but
i
had
done
with
care
and
anxiety
hunger
or
fear
for
that
space
i
floated
thinking
with
a
strange
breadth
and
freedom
of
all
that
we
had
undergone
and
of
all
my
life
and
motives
and
the
secret
issues
of
my
being
i
seemed
to
myself
to
have
grown
greater
and
greater
to
have
lost
all
sense
of
movement
to
be
floating
amidst
the
stars
and
always
the
sense
of
littleness
and
the
infinite
littleness
of
my
life
upon
it
was
implicit
in
my
thoughts
i
profess
to
explain
the
things
that
happened
in
my
mind
no
doubt
they
could
all
be
traced
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
curious
physical
conditions
under
which
i
was
living
i
set
them
down
here
just
for
what
they
are
worth
and
without
any
comment
the
most
prominent
quality
of
it
was
a
pervading
doubt
of
my
own
identity
i
became
if
i
may
so
express
it
dissociate
from
bedford
i
looked
down
on
bedford
as
a
trivial
incidental
thing
with
which
i
chanced
to
be
connected
i
saw
bedford
in
many
an
ass
or
as
a
poor
beast
where
i
had
hitherto
been
inclined
to
regard
him
with
a
quiet
pride
as
a
very
spirited
or
rather
forcible
person
i
saw
him
not
only
as
an
ass
but
as
the
son
of
many
generations
of
asses
i
reviewed
his
and
his
early
manhood
and
his
first
encounter
with
love
very
much
as
one
might
review
the
proceedings
of
an
ant
in
the
sand
something
of
that
period
of
lucidity
i
regret
still
hangs
about
me
and
i
doubt
if
i
shall
ever
recover
the
self
satisfaction
of
my
early
days
but
at
the
time
the
thing
was
not
in
the
least
painful
because
i
had
that
extraordinary
persuasion
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
no
more
bedford
than
i
was
any
one
else
but
only
a
mind
floating
in
the
still
serenity
of
space
why
should
i
be
disturbed
about
this
shortcomings
i
was
not
responsible
for
him
or
them
for
a
time
i
struggled
against
this
really
very
grotesque
delusion
i
tried
to
summon
the
memory
of
vivid
moments
of
tender
or
intense
emotions
to
my
assistance
i
felt
that
if
i
could
recall
one
genuine
twinge
of
feeling
the
growing
severance
would
be
stopped
but
i
could
not
do
it
i
saw
bedford
rushing
down
chancery
lane
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
coat
tails
flying
out
for
his
public
examination
i
saw
him
dodging
and
bumping
against
and
even
saluting
other
similar
little
creatures
in
that
swarming
gutter
of
people
me
i
saw
bedford
that
same
evening
in
the
of
a
certain
lady
and
his
hat
was
on
the
table
beside
him
and
it
wanted
brushing
badly
and
he
was
in
tears
me
i
saw
him
with
that
lady
in
various
attitudes
and
never
felt
so
detached
before
i
saw
him
hurrying
off
to
lympne
to
write
a
play
and
accosting
cavor
and
in
his
shirt
sleeves
working
at
the
sphere
and
walking
out
to
canterbury
because
he
was
afraid
to
come
me
i
did
not
believe
it
i
still
reasoned
that
all
this
was
hallucination
due
to
my
solitude
and
the
fact
that
i
had
lost
all
weight
and
sense
of
resistance
i
endeavoured
to
recover
that
sense
by
banging
myself
about
the
sphere
by
pinching
my
hands
and
clasping
them
together
among
other
things
i
lit
the
light
captured
that
torn
copy
of
and
read
those
convincingly
realistic
advertisements
about
the
cutaway
bicycle
and
the
gentleman
of
private
means
and
the
lady
in
distress
who
was
selling
those
and
there
was
no
doubt
they
existed
surely
enough
and
said
i
is
your
world
and
you
are
bedford
and
you
are
going
back
to
live
among
things
like
that
for
all
the
rest
of
your
but
the
doubts
within
me
could
still
argue
is
not
you
that
is
reading
it
is
bedford
but
you
are
not
bedford
you
know
just
where
the
mistake
comes
it
i
cried
if
i
am
not
bedford
what
am
i
but
in
that
direction
no
light
was
forthcoming
though
the
strangest
fancies
came
drifting
into
my
brain
queer
remote
suspicions
like
shadows
seen
from
away
do
you
know
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
that
really
i
was
something
quite
outside
not
only
the
world
but
all
worlds
and
out
of
space
and
time
and
that
this
poor
bedford
was
just
a
peephole
through
which
i
looked
at
life
bedford
however
i
disavowed
him
there
i
was
most
certainly
bound
up
with
him
and
i
knew
that
wherever
or
whatever
i
might
be
i
must
needs
feel
the
stress
of
his
desires
and
sympathise
with
all
his
joys
and
sorrows
until
his
life
should
end
and
with
the
dying
of
then
enough
of
this
remarkable
phase
of
my
experiences
i
tell
it
here
simply
to
show
how
isolation
and
departure
from
this
planet
touched
not
only
the
functions
and
feeling
of
every
organ
of
the
body
but
indeed
also
the
very
fabric
of
the
mind
with
strange
and
unanticipated
disturbances
all
through
the
major
portion
of
that
vast
space
journey
i
hung
thinking
of
such
immaterial
things
as
these
hung
dissociated
and
apathetic
a
cloudy
megalomaniac
as
it
were
amidst
the
stars
and
planets
in
the
void
of
space
and
not
only
the
world
to
which
i
was
returning
but
the
caverns
of
the
selenites
their
helmet
faces
their
gigantic
and
wonderful
machines
and
the
fate
of
cavor
dragged
helpless
into
that
world
seemed
infinitely
minute
and
altogether
trivial
things
to
me
until
at
last
i
began
to
feel
the
pull
of
the
earth
upon
my
being
drawing
me
back
again
to
the
life
that
is
real
for
men
and
then
indeed
it
grew
clearer
and
clearer
to
me
that
i
was
quite
certainly
bedford
after
all
and
returning
after
amazing
adventures
to
this
world
of
ours
and
with
a
life
that
i
was
very
likely
to
lose
in
this
return
i
set
myself
to
puzzle
out
the
conditions
under
which
i
must
fall
to
earth
xxi
bedford
at
littlestone
my
line
of
flight
was
about
parallel
with
the
surface
as
i
came
into
the
upper
air
the
temperature
of
the
sphere
began
to
rise
forthwith
i
knew
it
behoved
me
to
drop
at
once
far
below
me
in
a
darkling
twilight
stretched
a
great
expanse
of
sea
i
opened
every
window
i
could
and
of
sunshine
into
evening
and
out
of
evening
into
night
vaster
grew
the
earth
and
vaster
swallowing
up
the
stars
and
the
silvery
translucent
starlit
veil
of
cloud
it
wore
spread
out
to
catch
me
at
last
the
world
seemed
no
longer
a
sphere
but
flat
and
then
concave
it
was
no
longer
a
planet
in
the
sky
but
the
world
of
man
i
shut
all
but
an
inch
or
so
of
earthward
window
and
dropped
with
a
slackening
velocity
the
broadening
water
now
so
near
that
i
could
see
the
dark
glitter
of
the
waves
rushed
up
to
meet
me
the
sphere
became
very
hot
i
snapped
the
last
strip
of
window
and
sat
scowling
and
biting
my
knuckles
waiting
for
the
impact
the
sphere
hit
the
water
with
a
huge
splash
it
must
have
sent
it
fathoms
high
at
the
splash
i
flung
the
cavorite
shutters
open
down
i
went
but
slower
and
slower
and
then
i
felt
the
sphere
pressing
against
my
feet
and
so
drove
up
again
as
a
bubble
drives
and
at
the
last
i
was
floating
and
rocking
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
my
journey
in
space
was
at
an
end
the
night
was
dark
and
overcast
two
yellow
pinpoints
far
away
showed
the
passing
of
a
ship
and
nearer
was
a
red
glare
that
came
and
went
had
not
the
electricity
of
my
exhausted
itself
i
could
have
got
picked
up
that
night
in
spite
of
the
inordinate
fatigue
i
was
beginning
to
feel
i
was
excited
now
and
for
a
time
hopeful
in
a
feverish
impatient
way
that
so
my
travelling
might
end
but
at
last
i
ceased
to
move
about
and
sat
wrists
on
knees
staring
at
a
distant
red
light
it
swayed
up
and
down
rocking
rocking
my
excitement
passed
i
realised
i
had
yet
to
spend
another
night
at
least
in
the
sphere
i
perceived
myself
infinitely
heavy
and
fatigued
and
so
i
fell
asleep
a
change
in
my
rhythmic
motion
awakened
me
i
peered
through
the
refracting
glass
and
saw
that
i
had
come
aground
upon
a
huge
shallow
of
sand
far
away
i
seemed
to
see
houses
and
trees
and
seaward
a
curved
vague
distortion
of
a
ship
hung
between
sea
and
sky
i
stood
up
and
staggered
my
one
desire
was
to
emerge
the
manhole
was
upward
and
i
wrestled
with
the
screw
slowly
i
opened
the
manhole
at
last
the
air
was
singing
in
again
as
once
it
had
sung
out
but
this
time
i
did
not
wait
until
the
pressure
was
adjusted
in
another
moment
i
had
the
weight
of
the
window
on
my
hands
and
i
was
open
wide
open
to
the
old
familiar
sky
of
earth
the
air
hit
me
on
the
chest
so
that
i
gasped
i
dropped
the
glass
screw
i
cried
out
put
my
hands
to
my
chest
and
sat
down
for
a
time
i
was
in
pain
then
i
took
deep
breaths
at
last
i
could
rise
and
move
about
again
i
tried
to
thrust
my
head
through
the
manhole
and
the
sphere
rolled
over
it
was
as
though
something
had
lugged
my
head
down
directly
it
emerged
i
ducked
back
sharply
or
i
should
have
been
pinned
face
under
water
after
some
wriggling
and
shoving
i
managed
to
crawl
out
upon
sand
over
which
the
retreating
waves
still
came
and
went
i
did
not
attempt
to
stand
up
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
body
must
be
suddenly
changed
to
lead
mother
earth
had
her
grip
on
me
cavorite
intervening
i
sat
down
heedless
of
the
water
that
came
over
my
feet
it
was
dawn
a
grey
dawn
rather
overcast
but
showing
here
and
there
a
long
patch
of
greenish
grey
some
way
out
a
ship
was
lying
at
anchor
a
pale
silhouette
of
a
ship
with
one
yellow
light
the
water
came
rippling
in
in
long
shallow
waves
away
to
the
right
curved
the
land
a
shingle
bank
with
little
hovels
and
at
last
a
lighthouse
a
sailing
mark
and
a
point
inland
stretched
a
space
of
level
sand
broken
here
and
there
by
pools
of
water
and
ending
a
mile
away
perhaps
in
a
low
shore
of
scrub
to
the
some
isolated
was
visible
a
row
of
gaunt
the
tallest
things
that
i
could
see
on
earth
dull
dabs
against
the
brightening
sky
what
strange
men
can
have
reared
these
vertical
piles
in
such
an
amplitude
of
space
i
do
not
know
there
they
are
like
pieces
of
brighton
lost
in
the
waste
for
a
long
time
i
sat
there
yawning
and
rubbing
my
face
at
last
i
struggled
to
rise
it
made
me
feel
that
i
was
lifting
a
weight
i
stood
up
i
stared
at
the
distant
houses
for
the
first
time
since
our
starvation
in
the
crater
i
thought
of
earthly
food
i
whispered
good
toast
and
good
coffee
and
how
the
devil
am
i
going
to
get
all
this
stuff
to
lympne
i
wondered
where
i
was
it
was
an
east
shore
anyhow
and
i
had
seen
europe
before
i
dropped
i
heard
footsteps
crunching
in
the
sand
and
a
little
man
in
flannels
with
a
bathing
towel
wrapped
about
his
shoulders
and
his
bathing
dress
over
his
arm
appeared
up
the
beach
i
knew
instantly
that
i
must
be
in
england
he
was
staring
most
intently
at
the
sphere
and
me
he
advanced
staring
i
dare
say
i
looked
a
ferocious
savage
unkempt
to
an
indescribable
degree
but
it
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
time
he
stopped
at
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
my
man
he
said
doubtfully
yourself
said
i
he
advanced
reassured
by
that
on
earth
is
that
thing
he
asked
you
tell
me
where
i
am
i
asked
littlestone
he
said
pointing
to
the
houses
dungeness
have
you
just
landed
that
thing
got
some
sort
of
machine
you
floated
ashore
have
you
been
wrecked
or
something
what
is
it
i
meditated
swiftly
i
made
an
estimate
of
the
little
appearance
as
he
drew
nearer
jove
he
said
had
a
time
of
it
i
thought
where
were
you
cast
away
is
that
thing
a
sort
of
floating
thing
for
saving
life
i
decided
to
take
that
line
for
the
present
i
made
a
few
vague
affirmatives
want
help
i
said
hoarsely
want
to
get
some
stuff
up
the
i
very
well
leave
i
became
aware
of
three
other
young
men
with
towels
blazers
and
straw
hats
coming
down
the
sands
towards
me
evidently
the
early
bathing
section
of
this
littlestone
said
the
young
man
he
became
vaguely
active
particularly
do
you
want
done
he
turned
round
and
gesticulated
the
three
young
men
accelerated
their
pace
in
a
minute
they
were
about
me
plying
me
with
questions
i
was
indisposed
to
answer
tell
all
that
later
i
said
dead
beat
a
up
to
the
hotel
said
the
foremost
little
man
look
after
that
thing
i
hesitated
i
said
that
sphere
two
big
bars
of
they
looked
incredulously
at
one
another
then
at
me
with
a
new
inquiry
i
went
to
the
sphere
stooped
crept
in
and
presently
they
had
the
crowbars
and
the
broken
chain
before
them
if
i
had
not
been
so
horribly
fagged
i
could
have
laughed
at
them
it
was
like
kittens
round
a
beetle
they
know
what
to
do
with
the
stuff
the
fat
little
man
stooped
and
lifted
the
end
of
one
of
the
bars
and
then
dropped
it
with
a
grunt
then
they
all
did
lead
or
gold
said
one
said
another
right
enough
said
the
third
then
they
all
stared
at
me
and
then
they
all
stared
at
the
ship
lying
at
anchor
say
cried
the
little
man
where
did
you
get
that
i
was
too
tired
to
keep
up
a
lie
got
it
in
the
i
saw
them
stare
at
one
another
here
said
i
not
going
to
argue
now
help
me
carry
these
lumps
of
gold
up
to
the
guess
with
rests
two
of
you
can
manage
one
and
trail
this
chain
tell
you
more
when
had
some
how
about
that
thing
hurt
there
i
said
it
must
stop
there
now
if
the
tide
comes
up
it
will
float
all
and
in
a
state
of
enormous
wonderment
these
young
men
most
obediently
hoisted
my
treasures
on
their
shoulders
and
with
limbs
that
felt
like
lead
i
headed
a
sort
of
procession
towards
that
distant
fragment
of
there
we
were
reinforced
by
two
little
girls
with
spades
and
later
a
lean
little
boy
with
a
penetrating
sniff
appeared
he
was
i
remember
wheeling
a
bicycle
and
he
accompanied
us
at
a
distance
of
about
a
hundred
yards
on
our
right
flank
and
then
i
suppose
gave
us
up
as
uninteresting
mounted
his
bicycle
and
rode
off
over
the
level
sands
in
the
direction
of
the
sphere
i
glanced
back
after
him
touch
it
said
the
stout
young
man
reassuringly
and
i
was
only
too
willing
to
be
reassured
at
first
something
of
the
grey
of
the
morning
was
in
my
mind
but
presently
the
sun
disengaged
itself
from
the
level
clouds
of
the
horizon
and
lit
the
world
and
turned
the
leaden
sea
to
glittering
waters
my
spirits
rose
a
sense
of
the
vast
importance
of
the
things
i
had
done
and
had
yet
to
do
came
with
the
sunlight
into
my
mind
i
laughed
aloud
as
the
foremost
man
staggered
under
my
gold
when
indeed
i
took
my
place
in
the
world
how
amazed
the
world
would
be
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
inordinate
fatigue
the
landlord
of
the
littlestone
hotel
would
have
been
amusing
as
he
hesitated
between
my
gold
and
my
respectable
company
on
the
one
and
my
filthy
appearance
on
the
other
but
at
last
i
found
myself
in
a
terrestrial
bathroom
once
more
with
warm
water
to
wash
myself
with
and
a
change
of
raiment
preposterously
small
indeed
but
anyhow
clean
that
the
genial
little
man
had
lent
me
he
lent
me
a
razor
too
but
i
could
not
screw
up
my
resolution
to
attack
even
the
outposts
of
the
bristling
beard
that
covered
my
face
i
sat
down
to
an
english
breakfast
and
ate
with
a
sort
of
languid
appetite
many
weeks
old
and
very
stirred
myself
to
answer
the
questions
of
the
four
young
men
and
i
told
them
the
truth
said
i
you
press
got
it
in
the
moon
the
moon
in
the
how
do
you
mean
i
say
confound
it
you
have
just
come
from
the
moon
through
that
and
i
took
a
delicious
mouthful
of
egg
i
made
a
private
note
that
when
i
went
back
to
the
moon
i
would
take
a
box
of
eggs
i
could
see
clearly
that
they
did
not
believe
one
word
of
what
i
told
them
but
evidently
they
considered
me
the
most
respectable
liar
they
had
ever
met
they
glanced
at
one
another
and
then
concentrated
the
fire
of
their
eyes
on
me
i
fancy
they
expected
a
clue
to
me
in
the
way
i
helped
myself
to
salt
they
seemed
to
find
something
significant
in
my
peppering
my
egg
these
strangely
shaped
masses
of
gold
they
had
staggered
under
held
their
minds
there
the
lumps
lay
in
front
of
me
each
worth
thousands
of
pounds
and
as
impossible
for
any
one
to
steal
as
a
house
or
a
piece
of
land
as
i
looked
at
their
curious
faces
over
my
i
realised
something
of
the
enormous
wilderness
of
explanations
into
which
i
should
have
to
wander
to
render
myself
comprehensible
again
began
the
youngest
young
man
in
the
tone
of
one
who
speaks
to
an
obstinate
child
pass
me
that
i
said
and
shut
him
up
completely
look
here
i
say
began
one
of
the
others
not
going
to
believe
that
you
well
said
i
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
want
to
tell
us
said
the
youngest
young
man
in
a
stage
aside
and
then
with
an
appearance
of
great
mind
if
i
take
a
cigarette
i
waved
him
a
cordial
assent
and
proceeded
with
my
breakfast
two
of
the
others
went
and
looked
out
of
the
farther
window
and
talked
inaudibly
i
was
struck
by
a
thought
tide
i
said
running
out
there
was
a
pause
a
doubt
who
should
answer
me
near
the
ebb
said
the
fat
little
man
anyhow
i
said
float
i
decapitated
my
third
egg
and
began
a
little
speech
here
i
said
imagine
surly
or
telling
you
uncivil
lies
or
anything
of
that
sort
forced
almost
to
be
a
little
short
and
mysterious
i
can
quite
understand
this
is
as
queer
as
it
can
be
and
that
your
imaginations
must
be
going
it
i
can
assure
you
in
at
a
memorable
time
but
i
make
it
clear
to
you
impossible
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
come
from
the
moon
and
all
i
can
tell
you
all
the
same
tremendously
obliged
to
you
you
know
tremendously
i
hope
that
my
manner
in
any
way
given
you
not
in
the
least
said
the
youngest
young
man
affably
can
quite
understand
and
staring
hard
at
me
all
the
time
he
heeled
his
chair
back
until
it
very
nearly
upset
and
recovered
with
some
exertion
a
bit
of
it
said
the
fat
young
man
you
imagine
and
they
all
got
up
and
dispersed
and
walked
about
and
lit
cigarettes
and
generally
tried
to
show
they
were
perfectly
amiable
and
disengaged
and
entirely
free
from
the
slightest
curiosity
about
me
and
the
sphere
going
to
keep
an
eye
on
that
ship
out
there
all
the
same
i
heard
one
of
them
remarking
in
an
undertone
if
only
they
could
have
forced
themselves
to
it
they
would
i
believe
even
have
gone
out
and
left
me
i
went
on
with
my
third
egg
weather
the
fat
little
man
remarked
presently
been
immense
has
it
not
i
know
we
have
had
such
a
like
a
tremendous
rocket
and
somewhere
a
window
was
broken
that
said
i
cried
the
little
man
and
rushed
to
the
corner
window
all
the
others
rushed
to
the
window
likewise
i
sat
staring
at
them
suddenly
i
leapt
up
knocked
over
my
third
egg
rushed
for
the
window
also
i
had
just
thought
of
something
to
be
seen
there
cried
the
little
man
rushing
for
the
door
that
boy
i
cried
bawling
in
hoarse
fury
that
accursed
boy
and
turning
about
i
pushed
the
waiter
was
just
bringing
me
some
more
rushed
violently
out
of
the
room
and
down
and
out
upon
the
queer
little
esplanade
in
front
of
the
hotel
the
sea
which
had
been
smooth
was
rough
now
with
hurrying
and
all
about
where
the
sphere
had
been
was
tumbled
water
like
the
wake
of
a
ship
above
a
little
puff
of
cloud
whirled
like
dispersing
smoke
and
the
three
or
four
people
on
the
beach
were
staring
up
with
interrogative
faces
towards
the
point
of
that
unexpected
report
and
that
was
all
boots
and
waiter
and
the
four
young
men
in
blazers
came
rushing
out
behind
me
shouts
came
from
windows
and
doors
and
all
sorts
of
worrying
people
came
into
for
a
time
i
stood
there
too
overwhelmed
by
this
new
development
to
think
of
the
people
at
first
i
was
too
stunned
to
see
the
thing
as
any
definite
was
just
stunned
as
a
man
is
by
some
accidental
violent
blow
it
is
only
afterwards
he
begins
to
appreciate
his
specific
injury
lord
i
felt
as
though
somebody
was
pouring
funk
out
of
a
can
down
the
back
of
my
neck
my
legs
became
feeble
i
had
got
the
first
intimation
of
what
the
disaster
meant
for
me
there
was
that
confounded
high
i
was
utterly
left
there
was
the
gold
in
the
only
possession
on
earth
how
would
it
all
work
out
the
general
effect
was
of
a
gigantic
unmanageable
confusion
say
said
the
voice
of
the
little
man
behind
you
i
wheeled
about
and
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
people
a
sort
of
irregular
investment
of
people
all
bombarding
me
with
dumb
interrogation
with
infinite
doubt
and
suspicion
i
felt
the
compulsion
of
their
eyes
intolerably
i
groaned
aloud
i
shouted
tell
you
i
not
equal
to
it
you
must
puzzle
be
damned
to
you
i
gesticulated
convulsively
he
receded
a
step
as
though
i
had
threatened
him
i
made
a
bolt
through
them
into
the
hotel
i
charged
back
into
the
rang
the
bell
furiously
i
gripped
the
waiter
as
he
entered
hear
i
shouted
help
and
carry
these
bars
up
to
my
room
right
he
failed
to
understand
me
and
i
shouted
and
raved
at
him
a
little
old
man
in
a
green
apron
appeared
and
further
two
of
the
young
men
in
flannels
i
made
a
dash
at
them
and
commandeered
their
services
as
soon
as
the
gold
was
in
my
room
i
felt
free
to
quarrel
get
out
i
shouted
of
you
get
out
if
you
want
to
see
a
man
go
mad
before
your
eyes
and
i
helped
the
waiter
by
the
shoulder
as
he
hesitated
in
the
doorway
and
then
as
soon
as
i
had
the
door
locked
on
them
all
i
tore
off
the
little
clothes
again
shied
them
right
and
left
and
got
into
bed
forthwith
and
there
i
lay
swearing
and
panting
and
cooling
for
a
very
long
time
at
last
i
was
calm
enough
to
get
out
of
bed
and
ring
up
the
waiter
for
a
flannel
nightshirt
a
soda
and
whisky
and
some
good
cigars
and
these
things
being
procured
me
after
an
exasperating
delay
that
drove
me
several
times
to
the
bell
i
locked
the
door
again
and
proceeded
very
deliberately
to
look
the
entire
situation
in
the
face
the
net
result
of
the
great
experiment
presented
itself
as
an
absolute
failure
it
was
a
rout
and
i
was
the
sole
survivor
it
was
an
absolute
collapse
and
this
was
the
final
disaster
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
save
myself
and
as
much
as
i
could
in
the
way
of
prospects
from
our
at
one
fatal
crowning
blow
all
my
vague
resolutions
of
return
and
recovery
had
vanished
my
intention
of
going
back
to
the
moon
of
getting
a
sphereful
of
gold
and
afterwards
of
having
a
fragment
of
cavorite
analysed
and
so
recovering
the
great
finally
even
of
recovering
these
ideas
vanished
altogether
i
was
the
sole
survivor
and
that
was
all
i
think
that
going
to
bed
was
one
of
the
luckiest
ideas
i
have
ever
had
in
an
emergency
i
really
believe
i
should
either
have
got
or
done
some
indiscreet
thing
but
there
locked
in
and
secure
from
all
interruptions
i
could
think
out
the
position
in
all
its
bearings
and
make
my
arrangements
at
leisure
of
course
it
was
quite
clear
to
me
what
had
happened
to
the
boy
he
had
crawled
into
the
sphere
meddled
with
the
studs
shut
the
cavorite
windows
and
gone
up
it
was
highly
improbable
he
had
screwed
the
manhole
stopper
and
even
if
he
had
the
chances
were
a
thousand
to
one
against
his
getting
back
it
was
fairly
evident
that
he
would
gravitate
with
my
bales
to
somewhere
near
the
middle
of
the
sphere
and
remain
there
and
so
cease
to
be
a
legitimate
terrestrial
interest
however
remarkable
he
might
seem
to
the
inhabitants
of
some
remote
quarter
of
space
i
very
speedily
convinced
myself
on
that
point
and
as
for
any
responsibility
i
might
have
in
the
matter
the
more
i
reflected
upon
that
the
clearer
it
became
that
if
only
i
kept
quiet
about
things
i
need
not
trouble
myself
about
that
if
i
was
faced
by
sorrowing
parents
demanding
their
lost
boy
i
had
merely
to
demand
my
lost
ask
them
what
they
meant
at
first
i
had
had
a
vision
of
weeping
parents
and
guardians
and
all
sorts
of
complications
but
now
i
saw
that
i
simply
had
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
and
nothing
in
that
way
could
arise
and
indeed
the
more
i
lay
and
smoked
and
thought
the
more
evident
became
the
wisdom
of
impenetrability
it
is
within
the
right
of
every
british
citizen
provided
he
does
not
commit
damage
nor
indecorum
to
appear
suddenly
wherever
he
pleases
and
as
ragged
and
filthy
as
he
pleases
and
with
whatever
amount
of
virgin
gold
he
sees
fit
to
encumber
himself
and
no
one
has
any
right
at
all
to
hinder
and
detain
him
in
this
procedure
i
formulated
that
at
last
to
myself
and
repeated
it
over
as
a
sort
of
private
magna
charta
of
my
liberty
once
i
had
put
that
issue
on
one
side
i
could
take
up
and
consider
in
an
equable
manner
certain
considerations
i
had
scarcely
dared
to
think
of
before
namely
those
arising
out
of
the
circumstances
of
my
bankruptcy
but
now
looking
at
this
matter
calmly
and
at
leisure
i
could
see
that
if
only
i
suppressed
my
identity
by
a
temporary
assumption
of
some
less
name
and
if
i
retained
the
two
beard
that
had
grown
upon
me
the
risks
of
any
annoyance
from
the
spiteful
creditor
to
whom
i
have
already
alluded
became
very
small
indeed
from
that
to
a
definite
course
of
rational
worldly
action
was
plain
sailing
it
was
all
amazingly
petty
no
doubt
but
what
was
there
remaining
for
me
to
do
whatever
i
did
i
was
resolved
that
i
would
keep
myself
level
and
right
side
up
i
ordered
up
writing
materials
and
addressed
a
letter
to
the
new
romney
nearest
the
waiter
informed
the
manager
i
wished
to
open
an
account
with
him
and
requesting
him
to
send
two
trustworthy
persons
properly
authenticated
in
a
cab
with
a
good
horse
to
fetch
some
hundredweight
of
gold
with
which
i
happened
to
be
encumbered
i
signed
the
letter
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
thoroughly
respectable
sort
of
name
this
done
i
got
a
folkstone
blue
book
picked
out
an
outfitter
and
asked
him
to
send
a
cutter
to
measure
me
for
a
dark
tweed
suit
ordering
at
the
same
time
a
valise
dressing
bag
brown
boots
shirts
hat
to
fit
and
so
forth
and
from
a
watchmaker
i
also
ordered
a
watch
and
these
letters
being
despatched
i
had
up
as
good
a
lunch
as
the
hotel
could
give
and
then
lay
smoking
a
cigar
as
calm
and
ordinary
as
possible
until
in
accordance
with
my
instructions
two
duly
authenticated
clerks
came
from
the
bank
and
weighed
and
took
away
my
gold
after
which
i
pulled
the
clothes
over
my
ears
in
order
to
drown
any
knocking
and
went
very
comfortably
to
sleep
i
went
to
sleep
no
doubt
it
was
a
prosaic
thing
for
the
first
man
back
from
the
moon
to
do
and
i
can
imagine
that
the
young
and
imaginative
reader
will
find
my
behaviour
disappointing
but
i
was
horribly
fatigued
and
bothered
and
confound
it
what
else
was
there
to
do
there
certainly
was
not
the
remotest
chance
of
my
being
believed
if
i
had
told
my
story
then
and
it
would
certainly
have
subjected
me
to
intolerable
annoyances
i
went
to
sleep
when
at
last
i
woke
up
again
i
was
ready
to
face
the
world
as
i
have
always
been
accustomed
to
face
it
since
i
came
to
years
of
discretion
and
so
i
got
away
to
italy
and
there
it
is
i
am
writing
this
story
if
the
world
will
not
have
it
as
fact
then
the
world
may
take
it
as
fiction
it
is
no
concern
of
mine
and
now
that
the
account
is
finished
i
am
amazed
to
think
how
completely
this
adventure
is
gone
and
done
with
everybody
believes
that
cavor
was
a
not
very
brilliant
scientific
experimenter
who
blew
up
his
house
and
himself
at
lympne
and
they
explain
the
bang
that
followed
my
arrival
at
littlestone
by
a
reference
to
the
experiments
with
explosives
that
are
going
on
continually
at
the
government
establishment
of
lydd
two
miles
away
i
must
confess
that
hitherto
i
have
not
acknowledged
my
share
in
the
disappearance
of
master
tommy
simmons
which
was
that
little
name
that
perhaps
may
prove
a
difficult
item
of
corroboration
to
explain
away
they
account
for
my
appearance
in
rags
with
two
bars
of
indisputable
gold
upon
the
littlestone
beach
in
various
ingenious
worry
me
what
they
think
of
me
they
say
i
have
strung
all
these
things
together
to
avoid
being
questioned
too
closely
as
to
the
source
of
my
wealth
i
would
like
to
see
the
man
who
could
invent
a
story
that
would
hold
together
like
this
one
well
they
must
take
it
as
it
is
i
have
told
my
now
i
suppose
i
have
to
take
up
the
worries
of
this
terrestrial
life
again
even
if
one
has
been
to
the
moon
one
has
still
to
earn
a
living
so
i
am
working
here
at
amalfi
on
the
scenario
of
that
play
i
sketched
before
cavor
came
walking
into
my
world
and
i
am
trying
to
piece
my
life
together
as
it
was
before
ever
i
saw
him
i
must
confess
that
i
find
it
hard
to
keep
my
mind
on
the
play
when
the
moonshine
comes
into
my
room
it
is
full
moon
here
and
last
night
i
was
out
on
the
pergola
for
hours
staring
away
at
the
shining
blankness
that
hides
so
much
imagine
it
tables
and
chairs
and
trestles
and
bars
of
gold
confound
it
only
one
could
hit
on
that
cavorite
again
but
a
thing
like
that
come
twice
in
a
life
here
i
am
a
little
better
off
than
i
was
at
lympne
and
that
is
all
and
cavor
has
committed
suicide
in
a
more
elaborate
way
than
any
human
being
ever
did
before
so
the
story
closes
as
finally
and
completely
as
a
dream
it
fits
in
so
little
with
all
the
other
things
of
life
so
much
of
it
is
so
utterly
remote
from
all
human
experience
the
leaping
the
eating
the
breathing
and
these
weightless
times
that
indeed
there
are
moments
when
in
spite
of
my
moon
gold
i
do
more
than
half
believe
myself
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
dream
xxii
the
astonishing
communication
of
julius
wendigee
when
i
had
finished
my
account
of
my
return
to
the
earth
at
littlestone
i
wrote
end
made
a
flourish
and
threw
my
pen
aside
fully
believing
that
the
whole
story
of
the
first
men
in
the
moon
was
done
not
only
had
i
done
this
but
i
had
placed
my
manuscript
in
the
hands
of
a
literary
agent
had
permitted
it
to
be
sold
had
seen
the
greater
portion
of
it
appear
in
the
and
was
setting
to
work
again
upon
the
scenario
of
the
play
i
had
commenced
at
lympne
before
i
realised
that
the
end
was
not
yet
and
then
following
me
from
amalfi
to
algiers
there
reached
me
it
is
now
about
six
months
ago
one
of
the
most
astounding
communications
i
have
ever
been
fated
to
receive
briefly
it
informed
me
that
julius
wendigee
a
dutch
electrician
who
has
been
experimenting
with
certain
apparatus
akin
to
the
apparatus
used
by
tesla
in
america
in
the
hope
of
discovering
some
method
of
communication
with
mars
was
receiving
day
by
day
a
curiously
fragmentary
message
in
english
which
was
indisputably
emanating
from
cavor
in
the
moon
at
first
i
thought
the
thing
was
an
elaborate
practical
joke
by
some
one
who
had
seen
the
manuscript
of
my
narrative
i
answered
wendigee
jestingly
but
he
replied
in
a
manner
that
put
such
suspicion
altogether
aside
and
in
a
state
of
inconceivable
excitement
i
hurried
from
algiers
to
the
little
observatory
upon
the
monte
rosa
in
which
he
was
working
in
the
presence
of
his
record
and
his
above
all
of
the
messages
from
cavor
that
were
coming
to
lingering
doubts
vanished
i
decided
at
once
to
accept
a
proposal
he
made
to
me
to
remain
with
him
assisting
him
to
take
down
the
record
from
day
to
day
and
endeavouring
with
him
to
send
a
message
back
to
the
moon
cavor
we
learnt
was
not
only
alive
but
free
in
the
midst
of
an
almost
inconceivable
community
of
these
beings
these
in
the
blue
darkness
of
the
lunar
caves
he
was
lamed
it
seemed
but
otherwise
in
quite
good
better
health
he
distinctly
said
than
he
usually
enjoyed
on
earth
he
had
had
a
fever
but
it
had
left
no
bad
effects
but
curiously
enough
he
seemed
to
be
labouring
under
a
conviction
that
i
was
either
dead
in
the
moon
crater
or
lost
in
the
deep
of
space
his
message
began
to
be
received
by
wendigee
when
that
gentleman
was
engaged
in
quite
a
different
investigation
the
reader
will
no
doubt
recall
the
little
excitement
that
began
the
century
arising
out
of
an
announcement
by
nikola
tesla
the
american
electrical
celebrity
that
he
had
received
a
message
from
mars
his
announcement
renewed
attention
to
a
fact
that
had
long
been
familiar
to
scientific
people
namely
that
from
some
unknown
source
in
space
waves
of
electromagnetic
disturbance
entirely
similar
to
those
used
by
signor
marconi
for
his
wireless
telegraphy
are
constantly
reaching
the
earth
besides
tesla
quite
a
number
of
other
observers
have
been
engaged
in
perfecting
apparatus
for
receiving
and
recording
these
vibrations
though
few
would
go
so
far
as
to
consider
them
actual
messages
from
some
extraterrestrial
sender
among
that
few
however
we
must
certainly
count
wendigee
ever
since
he
had
devoted
himself
almost
entirely
to
this
subject
and
being
a
man
of
ample
means
he
had
erected
an
observatory
on
the
flanks
of
monte
rosa
in
a
position
singularly
adapted
in
every
way
for
such
observations
my
scientific
attainments
i
must
admit
are
not
great
but
so
far
as
they
enable
me
to
judge
contrivances
for
detecting
and
recording
any
disturbances
in
the
electromagnetic
conditions
of
space
are
singularly
original
and
ingenious
and
by
a
happy
combination
of
circumstances
they
were
set
up
and
in
operation
about
two
months
before
cavor
made
his
first
attempt
to
call
up
the
earth
consequently
we
have
fragments
of
his
communication
even
from
the
beginning
unhappily
they
are
only
fragments
and
the
most
momentous
of
all
the
things
that
he
had
to
tell
instructions
that
is
for
the
making
of
cavorite
if
indeed
he
ever
transmitted
throbbed
themselves
away
unrecorded
into
space
we
never
succeeded
in
getting
a
response
back
to
cavor
he
was
unable
to
tell
therefore
what
we
had
received
or
what
we
had
missed
nor
indeed
did
he
certainly
know
that
any
one
on
earth
was
really
aware
of
his
efforts
to
reach
us
and
the
persistence
he
displayed
in
sending
eighteen
long
descriptions
of
lunar
they
would
be
if
we
had
them
how
much
his
mind
must
have
turned
back
towards
his
native
planet
since
he
left
it
two
years
ago
you
can
imagine
how
amazed
wendigee
must
have
been
when
he
discovered
his
record
of
electromagnetic
disturbances
interlaced
by
straightforward
english
wendigee
knew
nothing
of
our
wild
journey
moonward
and
english
out
of
the
void
it
is
well
the
reader
should
understand
the
conditions
under
which
it
would
seem
these
messages
were
sent
somewhere
within
the
moon
cavor
certainly
had
access
for
a
time
to
a
considerable
amount
of
electrical
apparatus
and
it
would
seem
he
rigged
transmitting
arrangement
of
the
marconi
type
this
he
was
able
to
operate
at
irregular
intervals
sometimes
for
only
half
an
hour
or
so
sometimes
for
three
or
four
hours
at
a
stretch
at
these
times
he
transmitted
his
earthward
message
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
relative
position
of
the
moon
and
points
upon
the
surface
is
constantly
altering
as
a
consequence
of
this
and
of
the
necessary
imperfections
of
our
recording
instruments
his
communication
comes
and
goes
in
our
records
in
an
extremely
fitful
manner
it
becomes
blurred
it
in
a
mysterious
and
altogether
exasperating
way
and
added
to
this
is
the
fact
that
he
was
not
an
expert
operator
he
had
partly
forgotten
or
never
completely
mastered
the
code
in
general
use
and
as
he
became
fatigued
he
dropped
words
and
misspelt
in
a
curious
manner
altogether
we
have
probably
lost
quite
half
of
the
communications
he
made
and
much
we
have
is
damaged
broken
and
partly
effaced
in
the
abstract
that
follows
the
reader
must
be
prepared
therefore
for
a
considerable
amount
of
break
hiatus
and
change
of
topic
wendigee
and
i
are
collaborating
in
a
complete
and
annotated
edition
of
the
cavor
record
which
we
hope
to
publish
together
with
a
detailed
account
of
the
instruments
employed
beginning
with
the
first
volume
in
january
next
that
will
be
the
full
and
scientific
report
of
which
this
is
only
the
popular
transcript
but
here
we
give
at
least
sufficient
to
complete
the
story
i
have
told
and
to
give
the
broad
outlines
of
the
state
of
that
other
world
so
near
so
akin
and
yet
so
dissimilar
to
our
own
xxiii
an
abstract
of
the
six
messages
first
received
from
cavor
the
two
earlier
messages
of
cavor
may
very
well
be
reserved
for
that
larger
volume
they
simply
tell
with
greater
brevity
and
with
a
difference
in
several
details
that
is
interesting
but
not
of
any
vital
importance
the
bare
facts
of
the
making
of
the
sphere
and
our
departure
from
the
world
throughout
cavor
speaks
of
me
as
a
man
who
is
dead
but
with
a
curious
change
of
temper
as
he
approaches
our
landing
on
the
moon
bedford
he
says
of
me
and
poor
young
man
and
he
blames
himself
for
inducing
a
young
man
no
means
well
equipped
for
such
adventures
to
leave
a
planet
which
he
was
indisputably
fitted
to
on
so
precarious
a
mission
i
think
he
underrates
the
part
my
energy
and
practical
capacity
played
in
bringing
about
the
realisation
of
his
theoretical
sphere
arrived
he
says
with
no
more
account
of
our
passage
through
space
than
if
we
had
made
a
journey
of
common
occurrence
in
a
railway
train
and
then
he
becomes
increasingly
unfair
to
me
unfair
indeed
to
an
extent
i
should
not
have
expected
in
a
man
trained
in
the
search
for
truth
looking
back
over
my
previously
written
account
of
these
things
i
must
insist
that
i
have
been
altogether
juster
to
cavor
than
he
has
been
to
me
i
have
extenuated
little
and
suppressed
nothing
but
his
account
is
speedily
became
apparent
that
the
entire
strangeness
of
our
circumstances
and
loss
of
weight
attenuated
but
highly
oxygenated
air
consequent
exaggeration
of
the
results
of
muscular
effort
rapid
development
of
weird
plants
from
obscure
spores
lurid
exciting
my
companion
unduly
on
the
moon
his
character
seemed
to
deteriorate
he
became
impulsive
rash
and
quarrelsome
in
a
little
while
his
folly
in
devouring
some
gigantic
vesicles
and
his
consequent
intoxication
led
to
our
capture
by
the
we
had
had
the
slightest
opportunity
of
properly
observing
their
ways
he
says
you
observe
nothing
of
his
own
concession
to
these
same
and
he
goes
on
from
that
point
to
say
that
came
to
a
difficult
passage
with
them
and
bedford
mistaking
certain
gestures
of
gestures
they
were
way
to
a
panic
violence
he
ran
amuck
killed
three
and
perforce
i
had
to
flee
with
him
after
the
outrage
subsequently
we
fought
with
a
number
who
endeavoured
to
bar
our
way
and
slew
seven
or
eight
more
it
says
much
for
the
tolerance
of
these
beings
that
on
my
recapture
i
was
not
instantly
slain
we
made
our
way
to
the
exterior
and
separated
in
the
crater
of
our
arrival
to
increase
our
chances
of
recovering
our
sphere
but
presently
i
came
upon
a
body
of
selenites
led
by
two
who
were
curiously
different
even
in
form
from
any
of
these
we
had
seen
hitherto
with
larger
heads
and
smaller
bodies
and
much
more
elaborately
wrapped
about
and
after
evading
them
for
some
time
i
fell
into
a
crevasse
cut
my
head
rather
badly
and
displaced
my
patella
and
finding
crawling
very
painful
decided
to
they
would
still
permit
me
to
do
so
this
they
did
and
perceiving
my
helpless
condition
carried
me
with
them
again
into
the
moon
and
of
bedford
i
have
heard
or
seen
nothing
more
nor
so
far
as
i
can
gather
has
any
selenite
either
the
night
overtook
him
in
the
crater
or
else
which
is
more
probable
he
found
the
sphere
and
desiring
to
steal
a
march
upon
me
made
off
with
i
fear
to
find
it
uncontrollable
and
to
meet
a
more
lingering
fate
in
outer
and
with
that
cavor
dismisses
me
and
goes
on
to
more
interesting
topics
i
dislike
the
idea
of
seeming
to
use
my
position
as
his
editor
to
deflect
his
story
in
my
own
interest
but
i
am
obliged
to
protest
here
against
the
turn
he
gives
these
occurrences
he
said
nothing
about
that
gasping
message
on
the
paper
in
which
he
told
or
attempted
to
tell
a
very
different
story
the
dignified
is
an
altogether
new
view
of
the
affair
that
has
come
to
him
i
must
insist
since
he
began
to
feel
secure
among
the
lunar
people
and
as
for
the
a
conception
i
am
quite
willing
to
let
the
reader
decide
between
us
on
what
he
has
before
him
i
know
i
am
not
a
model
have
made
no
pretence
to
be
but
am
i
however
that
is
the
sum
of
my
wrongs
from
this
point
i
can
edit
cavor
with
an
untroubled
mind
for
he
mentions
me
no
more
it
would
seem
the
selenites
who
had
come
upon
him
carried
him
to
some
point
in
the
interior
down
great
by
means
of
what
he
describes
as
sort
of
we
gather
from
the
rather
confused
passage
in
which
he
describes
this
and
from
a
number
of
chance
allusions
and
hints
in
other
and
subsequent
messages
that
this
is
one
of
an
enormous
system
of
artificial
shafts
that
run
each
from
what
is
called
a
lunar
downwards
for
very
nearly
a
hundred
miles
towards
the
central
portion
of
our
satellite
these
shafts
communicate
by
transverse
tunnels
they
throw
out
abysmal
caverns
and
expand
into
great
globular
places
the
whole
of
the
substance
for
a
hundred
miles
inward
indeed
is
a
mere
sponge
of
rock
says
cavor
sponginess
is
natural
but
very
largely
it
is
due
to
the
enormous
industry
of
the
selenites
in
the
past
the
enormous
circular
mounds
of
the
excavated
rock
and
earth
it
is
that
form
these
great
circles
about
the
tunnels
known
to
earthly
astronomers
misled
by
a
false
analogy
as
it
was
down
this
shaft
they
took
him
in
this
of
he
speaks
of
at
first
into
an
inky
blackness
and
then
into
a
region
of
continually
increasing
phosphorescence
despatches
show
him
to
be
curiously
regardless
of
detail
for
a
scientific
man
but
we
gather
that
this
light
was
due
to
the
streams
and
cascades
of
doubt
containing
some
phosphorescent
flowed
ever
more
abundantly
downward
towards
the
central
sea
and
as
he
descended
he
says
selenites
also
became
and
at
last
far
below
him
he
saw
as
it
were
a
lake
of
heatless
fire
the
waters
of
the
central
sea
glowing
and
eddying
in
strange
perturbation
luminous
blue
milk
that
is
just
on
the
lunar
sea
says
cavor
in
a
later
passage
not
a
stagnant
ocean
a
solar
tide
sends
it
in
a
perpetual
flow
around
the
lunar
axis
and
strange
storms
and
boilings
and
rushings
of
its
waters
occur
and
at
times
cold
winds
and
thunderings
that
ascend
out
of
it
into
the
busy
ways
of
the
great
above
it
is
only
when
the
water
is
in
motion
that
it
gives
out
light
in
its
rare
seasons
of
calm
it
is
black
commonly
when
one
sees
it
its
waters
rise
and
fall
in
an
oily
swell
and
flakes
and
big
rafts
of
shining
bubbly
foam
drift
with
the
sluggish
faintly
glowing
current
the
selenites
navigate
its
cavernous
straits
and
lagoons
in
little
shallow
boats
of
a
shape
and
even
before
my
journey
to
the
galleries
about
the
grand
lunar
who
is
master
of
the
moon
i
was
permitted
to
make
a
brief
excursion
on
its
waters
caverns
and
passages
are
naturally
very
tortuous
a
large
proportion
of
these
ways
are
known
only
to
expert
pilots
among
the
fishermen
and
not
infrequently
selenites
are
lost
for
ever
in
their
labyrinths
in
their
remoter
recesses
i
am
told
strange
creatures
lurk
some
of
them
terrible
and
dangerous
creatures
that
all
the
science
of
the
moon
has
been
unable
to
exterminate
there
is
particularly
the
rapha
an
inextricable
mass
of
clutching
tentacles
that
one
hacks
to
pieces
only
to
multiply
and
the
tzee
a
darting
creature
that
is
never
seen
so
subtly
and
suddenly
does
it
slay
he
gives
us
a
gleam
of
description
was
reminded
on
this
excursion
of
what
i
have
read
of
the
mammoth
caves
if
only
i
had
had
a
yellow
flambeau
instead
of
the
pervading
blue
light
and
a
boatman
with
an
oar
instead
of
a
selenite
working
an
engine
at
the
back
of
the
canoe
i
could
have
imagined
i
had
suddenly
got
back
to
earth
the
rocks
about
us
were
very
various
sometimes
black
sometimes
pale
blue
and
veined
and
once
they
flashed
and
glittered
as
though
we
had
come
into
a
mine
of
sapphires
and
below
one
saw
the
ghostly
phosphorescent
fishes
flash
and
vanish
in
the
hardly
less
phosphorescent
deep
then
presently
a
long
vista
down
the
turgid
stream
of
one
of
the
channels
of
traffic
and
a
landing
stage
and
then
perhaps
a
glimpse
up
the
enormous
crowded
shaft
of
one
of
the
vertical
ways
one
great
place
heavy
with
glistening
stalactites
a
number
of
boats
were
fishing
we
went
alongside
one
of
these
and
watched
the
selenites
winding
in
a
net
they
were
little
hunchbacked
insects
with
very
strong
arms
short
bandy
legs
and
crinkled
as
they
pulled
at
it
that
net
seemed
the
heaviest
thing
i
had
come
upon
in
the
moon
it
was
loaded
with
doubt
of
it
took
a
long
time
to
draw
for
in
those
waters
the
larger
and
more
edible
fish
lurk
deep
the
fish
in
the
net
came
up
like
a
blue
blaze
of
darting
tossing
blue
their
catch
was
a
black
thing
ferociously
active
whose
appearance
they
greeted
with
shrieks
and
twitters
and
which
with
quick
nervous
movements
they
hacked
to
pieces
by
means
of
little
hatchets
all
its
dissevered
limbs
continued
to
lash
and
writhe
in
a
vicious
manner
afterwards
when
fever
had
hold
of
me
i
dreamt
again
and
again
of
that
bitter
furious
creature
rising
so
vigorous
and
active
out
of
the
unknown
sea
it
was
the
most
active
and
malignant
thing
of
all
the
living
creatures
i
have
yet
seen
in
this
world
inside
the
moon
surface
of
this
sea
must
be
very
nearly
two
hundred
miles
if
not
more
below
the
level
of
the
exterior
all
the
cities
of
the
moon
lie
i
learnt
immediately
above
this
central
sea
in
such
cavernous
spaces
and
artificial
galleries
as
i
have
described
and
they
communicate
with
the
exterior
by
enormous
vertical
shafts
which
open
invariably
in
what
are
called
by
earthly
astronomers
the
of
the
moon
the
lid
covering
one
such
aperture
i
had
already
seen
during
the
wanderings
that
had
preceded
my
capture
the
condition
of
the
less
central
portion
of
the
moon
i
have
not
yet
arrived
at
very
precise
knowledge
there
is
an
enormous
system
of
caverns
in
which
the
mooncalves
shelter
during
the
night
and
there
are
abattoirs
and
the
one
of
these
it
was
that
i
and
bedford
fought
with
the
selenite
i
have
since
seen
balloons
laden
with
meat
descending
out
of
the
upper
dark
i
have
as
yet
scarcely
learnt
as
much
of
these
things
as
a
zulu
in
london
would
learn
about
the
british
corn
supplies
in
the
same
time
it
is
clear
however
that
these
vertical
shafts
and
the
vegetation
of
the
surface
must
play
an
essential
role
in
ventilating
and
keeping
fresh
the
atmosphere
of
the
moon
at
one
time
and
particularly
on
my
first
emergence
from
my
prison
there
was
certainly
a
cold
wind
blowing
the
shaft
and
later
there
was
a
kind
of
sirocco
upward
that
corresponded
with
my
fever
for
at
the
end
of
about
three
weeks
i
fell
ill
of
an
indefinable
sort
of
fever
and
in
spite
of
sleep
and
the
quinine
tabloids
that
very
fortunately
i
had
brought
in
my
pocket
i
remained
ill
and
fretting
miserably
almost
to
the
time
when
i
was
taken
into
the
presence
of
the
grand
lunar
who
is
master
of
the
moon
will
not
dilate
on
the
wretchedness
of
my
condition
he
remarks
those
days
of
and
he
goes
on
with
great
amplitude
with
details
i
omit
here
temperature
he
concludes
abnormally
high
for
a
long
time
and
i
lost
all
desire
for
food
i
had
stagnant
waking
intervals
and
sleep
tormented
by
dreams
and
at
one
phase
i
was
i
remember
so
weak
as
to
be
and
almost
hysterical
i
longed
almost
intolerably
for
colour
to
break
the
everlasting
blue
he
reverts
again
presently
to
the
topic
of
this
lunar
atmosphere
i
am
told
by
astronomers
and
physicists
that
all
he
tells
is
in
absolute
accordance
with
what
was
already
known
of
the
condition
had
earthly
astronomers
had
the
courage
and
imagination
to
push
home
a
bold
induction
says
wendigee
they
might
have
foretold
almost
everything
that
cavor
has
to
say
of
the
general
structure
of
the
moon
they
know
now
pretty
certainly
that
moon
and
earth
are
not
so
much
satellite
and
primary
as
smaller
and
greater
sisters
made
out
of
one
mass
and
consequently
made
of
the
same
material
and
since
the
density
of
the
moon
is
only
that
of
the
earth
there
can
be
nothing
for
it
but
that
she
is
hollowed
out
by
a
great
system
of
caverns
there
was
no
necessity
said
sir
jabez
flap
that
most
entertaining
exponent
of
the
facetious
side
of
the
stars
that
we
should
ever
have
gone
to
the
moon
to
find
out
such
easy
inferences
and
points
the
pun
with
an
allusion
to
gruy√®re
but
he
certainly
might
have
announced
his
knowledge
of
the
hollowness
of
the
moon
before
and
if
the
moon
is
hollow
then
the
apparent
absence
of
air
and
water
is
of
course
quite
easily
explained
the
sea
lies
within
at
the
bottom
of
the
caverns
and
the
air
travels
through
the
great
sponge
of
galleries
in
accordance
with
simple
physical
laws
the
caverns
of
the
moon
on
the
whole
are
very
windy
places
as
the
sunlight
comes
round
the
moon
the
air
in
the
outer
galleries
on
that
side
is
heated
its
pressure
increases
some
flows
out
on
the
exterior
and
mingles
with
the
evaporating
air
of
the
craters
where
the
plants
remove
its
carbonic
acid
while
the
greater
portion
flows
round
through
the
galleries
to
replace
the
shrinking
air
of
the
cooling
side
that
the
sunlight
has
left
there
is
therefore
a
constant
eastward
breeze
in
the
air
of
the
outer
galleries
and
an
upflow
during
the
lunar
day
up
the
shafts
complicated
of
course
very
greatly
by
the
varying
shape
of
the
galleries
and
the
ingenious
contrivances
of
the
selenite
mind
xxiv
the
natural
history
of
the
selenites
the
messages
of
cavor
from
the
sixth
up
to
the
sixteenth
are
for
the
most
part
so
much
broken
and
they
abound
so
in
repetitions
that
they
scarcely
form
a
consecutive
narrative
they
will
be
given
in
full
of
course
in
the
scientific
report
but
here
it
will
be
far
more
convenient
to
continue
simply
to
abstract
and
quote
as
in
the
former
chapter
we
have
subjected
every
word
to
a
keen
critical
scrutiny
and
my
own
brief
memories
and
impressions
of
lunar
things
have
been
of
inestimable
help
in
interpreting
what
would
otherwise
have
been
impenetrably
dark
and
naturally
as
living
beings
our
interest
centres
far
more
upon
the
strange
community
of
lunar
insects
in
which
he
was
living
it
would
seem
as
an
honoured
guest
than
upon
the
mere
physical
condition
of
their
world
i
have
already
made
it
clear
i
think
that
the
selenites
i
saw
resembled
man
in
maintaining
the
erect
attitude
and
in
having
four
limbs
and
i
have
compared
the
general
appearance
of
their
heads
and
the
jointing
of
their
limbs
to
that
of
insects
i
have
mentioned
too
the
peculiar
consequence
of
the
smaller
gravitation
of
the
moon
on
their
fragile
slightness
cavor
confirms
me
upon
all
these
points
he
calls
them
though
of
course
they
fall
under
no
division
of
the
classification
of
earthly
creatures
and
he
points
out
insect
type
of
anatomy
had
fortunately
for
men
never
exceeded
a
relatively
very
small
size
on
the
largest
terrestrial
insects
living
or
extinct
do
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
measure
six
inches
in
length
here
against
the
lesser
gravitation
of
the
moon
a
creature
certainly
as
much
an
insect
as
vertebrate
seems
to
have
been
able
to
attain
to
human
and
he
does
not
mention
the
ant
but
throughout
his
allusions
the
ant
is
continually
being
brought
before
my
mind
in
its
sleepless
activity
in
its
intelligence
and
social
organisation
in
its
structure
and
more
particularly
in
the
fact
that
it
displays
in
addition
to
the
two
forms
the
male
and
the
female
form
that
almost
all
other
animals
possess
a
number
of
other
sexless
creatures
workers
soldiers
and
the
like
differing
from
one
another
in
structure
character
power
and
use
and
yet
all
members
of
the
same
species
for
these
selenites
also
have
a
great
variety
of
forms
of
course
they
are
not
only
colossally
greater
in
size
than
ants
but
also
in
opinion
at
least
in
intelligence
morality
and
social
wisdom
are
they
colossally
greater
than
men
and
instead
of
the
four
or
five
different
forms
of
ant
that
are
found
there
are
almost
innumerably
different
forms
of
selenite
i
had
endeavoured
to
indicate
the
very
considerable
difference
observable
in
such
selenites
of
the
outer
crust
as
i
happened
to
encounter
the
differences
in
size
and
proportions
were
certainly
as
wide
as
the
differences
between
the
most
widely
separated
races
of
men
but
such
differences
as
i
saw
fade
absolutely
to
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
huge
distinctions
of
which
cavor
tells
it
would
seem
the
exterior
selenites
i
saw
were
indeed
mostly
engaged
in
kindred
herds
butchers
fleshers
and
the
like
but
within
the
moon
practically
unsuspected
by
me
there
are
it
seems
a
number
of
other
sorts
of
selenite
differing
in
size
differing
in
the
relative
size
of
part
to
part
differing
in
power
and
appearance
and
yet
not
different
species
of
creatures
but
only
different
forms
of
one
species
and
retaining
through
all
their
variations
a
certain
common
likeness
that
marks
their
specific
unity
the
moon
is
indeed
a
sort
of
vast
only
instead
of
there
being
only
four
or
five
sorts
of
ant
there
are
many
hundred
different
sorts
of
selenite
and
almost
every
gradation
between
one
sort
and
another
it
would
seem
the
discovery
came
upon
cavor
very
speedily
i
infer
rather
than
learn
from
his
narrative
that
he
was
captured
by
the
mooncalf
herds
under
the
direction
of
these
other
selenites
who
larger
brain
cases
heads
and
very
much
shorter
finding
he
would
not
walk
even
under
the
goad
they
carried
him
into
darkness
crossed
a
narrow
bridge
that
may
have
been
the
identical
bridge
i
had
refused
and
put
him
down
in
something
that
must
have
seemed
at
first
to
be
some
sort
of
lift
this
was
the
had
certainly
been
absolutely
invisible
to
us
in
the
what
had
seemed
to
me
a
mere
into
the
void
was
really
no
doubt
the
passage
of
the
gangway
in
this
he
descended
towards
constantly
more
luminous
caverns
of
the
moon
at
first
they
descended
in
for
the
twitterings
of
the
then
into
a
stir
of
windy
movement
in
a
little
while
the
profound
blackness
had
made
his
eyes
so
sensitive
that
he
began
to
see
more
and
more
of
the
things
about
him
and
at
last
the
vague
took
shape
an
enormous
cylindrical
space
says
cavor
in
his
seventh
message
quarter
of
a
mile
across
perhaps
very
dimly
lit
at
first
and
then
brighter
with
big
platforms
twisting
down
its
sides
in
a
spiral
that
vanishes
at
last
below
in
a
blue
profundity
and
lit
even
more
could
not
tell
how
or
why
think
of
the
well
of
the
very
largest
spiral
staircase
or
that
you
have
ever
looked
down
and
magnify
that
by
a
hundred
imagine
it
at
twilight
seen
through
blue
glass
imagine
yourself
looking
down
that
only
imagine
also
that
you
feel
extraordinarily
light
and
have
got
rid
of
any
giddy
feeling
you
might
have
on
earth
and
you
will
have
the
first
conditions
of
my
impression
round
this
enormous
shaft
imagine
a
broad
gallery
running
in
a
much
steeper
spiral
than
would
be
credible
on
earth
and
forming
a
steep
road
protected
from
the
gulf
only
by
a
little
parapet
that
vanishes
at
last
in
perspective
a
couple
of
miles
below
up
i
saw
the
very
fellow
of
the
downward
vision
it
had
of
course
the
effect
of
looking
into
a
very
steep
cone
a
wind
was
blowing
down
the
shaft
and
far
above
i
fancy
i
heard
growing
fainter
and
fainter
the
bellowing
of
the
mooncalves
that
were
being
driven
down
again
from
their
evening
pasturage
on
the
exterior
and
up
and
down
the
spiral
galleries
were
scattered
numerous
moon
people
pallid
faintly
luminous
beings
regarding
our
appearance
or
busied
on
unknown
errands
i
fancied
it
or
a
flake
of
snow
came
drifting
down
on
the
icy
breeze
and
then
falling
like
a
snowflake
a
little
figure
a
little
clinging
to
a
parachute
drove
down
very
swiftly
towards
the
central
places
of
the
moon
selenite
sitting
beside
me
seeing
me
move
my
head
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
saw
pointed
with
his
and
indicated
a
sort
of
jetty
coming
into
sight
very
far
below
a
little
as
it
were
hanging
into
the
void
as
it
swept
up
towards
us
our
pace
diminished
very
rapidly
and
in
a
few
moments
as
it
seemed
we
were
abreast
of
it
and
at
rest
a
was
flung
and
grasped
and
i
found
myself
pulled
down
to
a
level
with
a
great
crowd
of
selenites
who
jostled
to
see
me
was
an
incredible
crowd
suddenly
and
violently
there
was
forced
upon
my
attention
the
vast
amount
of
difference
there
is
amongst
these
beings
of
the
moon
there
seemed
not
two
alike
in
all
that
jostling
multitude
they
differed
in
shape
they
differed
in
size
they
rang
all
the
horrible
changes
on
the
theme
of
selenite
form
some
bulged
and
overhung
some
ran
about
among
the
feet
of
their
fellows
all
of
them
had
a
grotesque
and
disquieting
suggestion
of
an
insect
that
has
somehow
contrived
to
mock
humanity
but
all
seemed
to
present
an
incredible
exaggeration
of
some
particular
feature
one
had
a
vast
right
an
enormous
antennal
arm
as
it
were
one
seemed
all
leg
poised
as
it
were
on
stilts
another
protruded
the
edge
of
his
face
mask
into
a
organ
that
made
him
startlingly
human
until
one
saw
his
expressionless
gaping
mouth
the
strange
and
except
for
the
want
of
mandibles
and
palps
most
head
of
the
underwent
indeed
the
most
incredible
transformations
here
it
was
broad
and
low
here
high
and
narrow
here
its
leathery
brow
was
drawn
out
into
horns
and
strange
features
here
it
was
whiskered
and
divided
and
there
with
a
grotesquely
human
profile
one
distortion
was
particularly
conspicuous
there
were
several
brain
cases
distended
like
bladders
to
a
huge
size
with
the
face
mask
reduced
to
quite
small
proportions
there
were
several
amazing
forms
with
heads
reduced
to
microscopic
proportions
and
blobby
bodies
and
fantastic
flimsy
things
that
existed
it
would
seem
only
as
a
basis
for
vast
protrusions
of
the
lower
part
of
the
mask
and
oddest
of
all
as
it
seemed
to
me
for
the
moment
two
or
three
of
these
weird
inhabitants
of
a
subterranean
world
a
world
sheltered
by
innumerable
miles
of
rock
from
sun
or
rain
in
their
tentaculate
terrestrial
looking
umbrellas
and
then
i
thought
of
the
parachutist
i
had
watched
descend
moon
people
behaved
exactly
as
a
human
crowd
might
have
done
in
similar
circumstances
they
jostled
and
thrust
one
another
they
shoved
one
another
aside
they
even
clambered
upon
one
another
to
get
a
glimpse
of
me
every
moment
they
increased
in
numbers
and
pressed
more
urgently
upon
the
discs
of
my
does
not
explain
what
he
means
by
moment
fresh
shapes
emerged
from
the
shadows
and
forced
themselves
upon
my
astounded
attention
and
presently
i
was
signed
and
helped
into
a
sort
of
litter
and
lifted
up
on
the
shoulders
of
bearers
and
so
borne
through
the
twilight
over
this
seething
multitude
towards
the
apartments
that
were
provided
for
me
in
the
moon
all
about
me
were
eyes
faces
masks
a
leathery
noise
like
the
rustling
of
beetle
wings
and
a
great
bleating
and
twittering
of
selenite
we
gather
he
was
taken
to
a
apartment
and
there
for
a
space
he
was
confined
afterwards
he
was
given
a
much
more
considerable
liberty
indeed
almost
as
much
freedom
as
one
has
in
a
civilised
town
on
earth
and
it
would
appear
that
the
mysterious
being
who
is
the
ruler
and
master
of
the
moon
appointed
two
selenites
large
to
guard
and
study
him
and
to
establish
whatever
mental
communications
were
possible
with
him
and
amazing
and
incredible
as
it
may
seem
these
two
creatures
these
fantastic
men
insects
these
beings
of
other
world
were
presently
communicating
with
cavor
by
means
of
terrestrial
speech
cavor
speaks
of
them
as
and
he
says
was
about
feet
high
he
had
small
slender
legs
about
inches
long
and
slight
feet
of
the
common
lunar
pattern
on
these
balanced
a
little
body
throbbing
with
the
pulsations
of
his
heart
he
had
long
soft
arms
ending
in
a
tentacled
grip
and
his
neck
was
in
the
usual
way
but
exceptionally
short
and
thick
his
head
says
alluding
to
some
previous
description
that
has
gone
astray
in
of
the
common
lunar
type
but
strangely
modified
the
mouth
has
the
usual
expressionless
gape
but
it
is
unusually
small
and
pointing
downward
and
the
mask
is
reduced
to
the
size
of
a
large
flat
on
either
side
are
the
little
eyes
rest
of
the
head
is
distended
into
a
huge
globe
and
the
chitinous
leathery
cuticle
of
the
mooncalf
herds
thins
out
to
a
mere
membrane
through
which
the
pulsating
brain
movements
are
distinctly
visible
he
is
a
creature
indeed
with
a
tremendously
hypertrophied
brain
and
with
the
rest
of
his
organism
both
relatively
and
absolutely
in
another
passage
cavor
compares
the
back
view
of
him
to
atlas
supporting
the
world
it
seems
was
a
very
similar
insect
but
his
was
drawn
out
to
a
considerable
length
and
the
brain
hypertrophy
being
in
different
regions
his
head
was
not
round
but
with
the
stalk
downward
there
were
also
lopsided
beings
with
enormous
shoulders
very
spidery
ushers
and
a
squat
foot
attendant
in
retinue
the
manner
in
which
and
attacked
the
problem
of
speech
was
fairly
obvious
they
came
into
this
in
which
cavor
was
confined
and
began
imitating
every
sound
he
made
beginning
with
a
cough
he
seems
to
have
grasped
their
intention
with
great
quickness
and
to
have
begun
repeating
words
to
them
and
pointing
to
indicate
the
application
the
procedure
was
probably
always
the
same
would
attend
to
cavor
for
a
space
then
point
also
and
say
the
word
he
had
heard
the
first
word
he
mastered
was
and
the
second
cavor
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
seems
to
have
used
instead
of
for
the
moon
race
as
soon
as
was
assured
of
the
meaning
of
a
word
he
repeated
it
to
who
remembered
it
infallibly
they
mastered
over
one
hundred
english
nouns
at
their
first
session
subsequently
it
seems
they
brought
an
artist
with
them
to
assist
the
work
of
explanation
with
sketches
and
drawings
being
rather
crude
was
says
cavor
being
with
an
active
arm
and
an
arresting
eye
and
he
seemed
to
draw
with
incredible
swiftness
the
eleventh
message
is
undoubtedly
only
a
fragment
of
a
longer
communication
after
some
broken
sentences
the
record
of
which
is
unintelligible
it
goes
on
it
will
interest
only
linguists
and
delay
me
too
long
to
give
the
details
of
the
series
of
intent
parleys
of
which
these
were
the
beginning
and
indeed
i
very
much
doubt
if
i
could
give
in
anything
like
the
proper
order
all
the
twistings
and
turnings
that
we
made
in
our
pursuit
of
mutual
comprehension
verbs
were
soon
plain
least
such
active
verbs
as
i
could
express
by
drawings
some
adjectives
were
easy
but
when
it
came
to
abstract
nouns
to
prepositions
and
the
sort
of
hackneyed
figures
of
speech
by
means
of
which
so
much
is
expressed
on
earth
it
was
like
diving
in
indeed
these
difficulties
were
insurmountable
until
to
the
sixth
lesson
came
a
fourth
assistant
a
being
with
a
huge
head
whose
was
clearly
the
pursuit
of
intricate
analogy
he
entered
in
a
preoccupied
manner
stumbling
against
a
stool
and
the
difficulties
that
arose
had
to
be
presented
to
him
with
a
certain
amount
of
clamour
and
hitting
and
pricking
before
they
reached
his
apprehension
but
once
he
was
involved
his
penetration
was
amazing
whenever
there
came
a
need
of
thinking
beyond
by
no
means
limited
scope
this
person
was
in
request
but
he
invariably
told
the
conclusion
to
in
order
that
it
might
be
remembered
was
ever
the
arsenal
for
facts
and
so
we
advanced
again
seemed
long
and
yet
matter
of
i
was
positively
talking
with
these
insects
of
the
moon
of
course
at
first
it
was
an
intercourse
infinitely
tedious
and
exasperating
but
imperceptibly
it
has
grown
to
comprehension
and
my
patience
has
grown
to
meet
its
limitations
it
is
who
does
all
the
talking
he
does
it
with
a
vast
amount
of
meditative
provisional
and
has
caught
up
one
or
two
phrases
if
i
may
say
you
understand
and
beads
all
his
speech
with
them
he
would
discourse
imagine
him
explaining
his
artist
i
may
eat
love
draw
no
other
thing
hate
all
who
not
draw
like
him
angry
hate
all
who
draw
like
him
better
hate
most
people
hate
all
who
not
think
all
world
for
to
draw
angry
all
things
mean
nothing
to
draw
he
like
you
if
you
understand
new
thing
to
draw
eh
to
remember
words
remember
wonderful
more
than
any
think
no
draw
he
referred
to
his
gifted
assistant
for
a
things
he
hear
is
more
wonderful
to
me
than
i
dreamt
that
anything
ever
could
be
again
to
hear
in
this
perpetual
obscurity
these
extraordinary
even
familiarity
fails
to
weaken
the
inhuman
effect
of
their
piping
a
nearer
approach
to
coherent
earthly
questions
giving
answers
i
feel
that
i
am
casting
back
to
the
period
of
childhood
again
when
the
ant
and
the
grasshopper
talked
together
and
the
bee
judged
between
them
and
while
these
linguistic
exercises
were
going
on
cavor
seems
to
have
experienced
a
considerable
relaxation
of
his
confinement
first
dread
and
distrust
our
unfortunate
conflict
aroused
is
being
he
said
effaced
by
the
deliberate
rationality
of
all
i
do
i
am
now
able
to
come
and
go
as
i
please
or
i
am
restricted
only
for
my
own
good
so
it
is
i
have
been
able
to
get
at
this
apparatus
and
assisted
by
a
happy
find
among
the
material
that
is
littered
in
this
enormous
i
have
contrived
to
despatch
these
messages
so
far
not
the
slightest
attempt
has
been
made
to
interfere
with
me
in
this
though
i
have
made
it
quite
clear
to
that
i
am
signalling
to
the
earth
talk
to
other
he
asked
watching
me
said
i
he
said
yes
men
i
went
on
cavor
was
continually
making
corrections
in
his
previous
accounts
of
the
selenites
as
fresh
facts
flowed
upon
him
to
modify
his
conclusions
and
accordingly
one
gives
the
quotations
that
follow
with
a
certain
amount
of
reservation
they
are
quoted
from
the
ninth
thirteenth
and
sixteenth
messages
and
altogether
vague
and
fragmentary
as
they
are
they
probably
give
as
complete
a
picture
of
the
social
life
of
this
strange
community
as
mankind
can
now
hope
to
have
for
many
generations
the
moon
says
cavor
citizen
knows
his
place
he
is
born
to
that
place
and
the
elaborate
discipline
of
training
and
education
and
surgery
he
undergoes
fits
him
at
last
so
completely
to
it
that
he
has
neither
ideas
nor
organs
for
any
purpose
beyond
it
should
he
would
ask
if
for
example
a
selenite
is
destined
to
be
a
mathematician
his
teachers
and
trainers
set
out
at
once
to
that
end
they
check
any
incipient
disposition
to
other
pursuits
they
encourage
his
mathematical
bias
with
a
perfect
psychological
skill
his
brain
grows
or
at
least
the
mathematical
faculties
of
his
brain
grow
and
the
rest
of
him
only
so
much
as
is
necessary
to
sustain
this
essential
part
of
him
at
last
save
for
rest
and
food
his
one
delight
lies
in
the
exercise
and
display
of
his
faculty
his
one
interest
in
its
application
his
sole
society
with
other
specialists
in
his
own
line
his
brain
grows
continually
larger
at
least
so
far
as
the
portions
engaging
in
mathematics
are
concerned
they
bulge
ever
larger
and
seem
to
suck
all
life
and
vigour
from
the
rest
of
his
frame
his
limbs
shrivel
his
heart
and
digestive
organs
diminish
his
insect
face
is
hidden
under
its
bulging
contours
his
voice
becomes
a
mere
stridulation
for
the
stating
of
formul√¶
he
seems
deaf
to
all
but
properly
enunciated
problems
the
faculty
of
laughter
save
for
the
sudden
discovery
of
some
paradox
is
lost
to
him
his
deepest
emotion
is
the
evolution
of
a
novel
computation
and
so
he
attains
his
end
again
a
selenite
appointed
to
be
a
minder
of
mooncalves
is
from
his
earliest
years
induced
to
think
and
live
mooncalf
to
find
his
pleasure
in
mooncalf
lore
his
exercise
in
their
tending
and
pursuit
he
is
trained
to
become
wiry
and
active
his
eye
is
indurated
to
the
tight
wrappings
the
angular
contours
that
constitute
a
he
takes
at
last
no
interest
in
the
deeper
part
of
the
moon
he
regards
all
selenites
not
equally
versed
in
mooncalves
with
indifference
derision
or
hostility
his
thoughts
are
of
mooncalf
pastures
and
his
dialect
an
accomplished
mooncalf
technique
so
also
he
loves
his
work
and
discharges
in
perfect
happiness
the
duty
that
justifies
his
being
and
so
it
is
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
is
a
perfect
unit
in
a
world
machine
beings
with
big
heads
on
whom
the
intellectual
labours
fall
form
a
sort
of
aristocracy
in
this
strange
society
and
at
the
head
of
them
quintessential
of
the
moon
is
that
marvellous
gigantic
ganglion
the
grand
lunar
into
whose
presence
i
am
finally
to
come
the
unlimited
development
of
the
minds
of
the
intellectual
class
is
rendered
possible
by
the
absence
of
any
bony
skull
in
the
lunar
anatomy
that
strange
box
of
bone
that
clamps
about
the
developing
brain
of
man
imperiously
insisting
far
and
no
to
all
his
possibilities
they
fall
into
three
main
classes
differing
greatly
in
influence
and
respect
there
are
administrators
of
whom
is
one
selenites
of
considerable
initiative
and
versatility
responsible
each
for
a
certain
cubic
content
of
the
bulk
the
experts
like
the
thinker
who
are
trained
to
perform
certain
special
operations
and
the
erudite
who
are
the
repositories
of
all
knowledge
to
the
latter
class
belongs
the
first
lunar
professor
of
terrestrial
languages
with
regard
to
these
latter
it
is
a
curious
little
thing
to
note
that
the
unlimited
growth
of
the
lunar
brain
has
rendered
unnecessary
the
invention
of
all
those
mechanical
aids
to
brain
work
which
have
distinguished
the
career
of
man
there
are
no
books
no
records
of
any
sort
no
libraries
or
inscriptions
all
knowledge
is
stored
in
distended
brains
much
as
the
of
texas
store
honey
in
their
distended
abdomens
the
lunar
somerset
house
and
the
lunar
british
museum
library
are
collections
of
living
brains
less
specialised
administrators
i
note
do
for
the
most
part
take
a
very
lively
interest
in
me
whenever
they
encounter
me
they
will
come
out
of
the
way
and
stare
at
me
and
ask
questions
to
which
will
reply
i
see
them
going
hither
and
thither
with
a
retinue
of
bearers
attendants
shouters
and
so
groups
to
see
the
experts
for
the
most
part
ignore
me
completely
even
as
they
ignore
each
other
or
notice
me
only
to
begin
a
clamorous
exhibition
of
their
distinctive
skill
the
erudite
for
the
most
part
are
rapt
in
an
impervious
and
apoplectic
complacency
from
which
only
a
denial
of
their
erudition
can
rouse
them
usually
they
are
led
about
by
little
watchers
and
attendants
and
often
there
are
small
and
creatures
small
females
usually
that
i
am
inclined
to
think
are
a
sort
of
wife
to
them
but
some
of
the
profounder
scholars
are
altogether
too
great
for
locomotion
and
are
carried
from
place
to
place
in
a
sort
of
sedan
tub
wabbling
jellies
of
knowledge
that
enlist
my
respectful
astonishment
i
have
just
passed
one
in
coming
to
this
place
where
i
am
permitted
to
amuse
myself
with
these
electrical
toys
a
vast
shaven
shaky
head
bald
and
carried
on
his
grotesque
stretcher
in
front
and
behind
came
his
bearers
and
curious
almost
news
disseminators
shrieked
his
fame
have
already
mentioned
the
retinues
that
accompany
most
of
the
intellectuals
ushers
bearers
valets
extraneous
tentacles
and
muscles
as
it
were
to
replace
the
abortive
physical
powers
of
these
hypertrophied
minds
porters
almost
invariably
accompany
them
there
are
also
extremely
swift
messengers
with
legs
and
for
grasping
parachutes
and
attendants
with
vocal
organs
that
could
well
nigh
wake
the
dead
apart
from
their
controlling
intelligence
these
subordinates
are
as
inert
and
helpless
as
umbrellas
in
a
stand
they
exist
only
in
relation
to
the
orders
they
have
to
obey
the
duties
they
have
to
perform
bulk
of
these
insects
however
who
go
to
and
fro
upon
the
spiral
ways
who
fill
the
ascending
balloons
and
drop
past
me
clinging
to
flimsy
parachutes
are
i
gather
of
the
operative
class
hands
indeed
some
of
these
are
in
actual
is
no
figure
of
speech
the
single
tentacle
of
the
mooncalf
herd
is
profoundly
modified
for
clawing
lifting
guiding
the
rest
of
them
no
more
than
necessary
subordinate
appendages
to
these
important
parts
some
who
i
suppose
deal
with
mechanisms
have
enormously
developed
auditory
organs
some
whose
work
lies
in
delicate
chemical
operations
project
a
vast
olfactory
organ
others
again
have
flat
feet
for
treadles
with
anchylosed
joints
and
i
have
been
told
are
mere
but
every
one
of
these
common
selenites
i
have
seen
at
work
is
exquisitely
adapted
to
the
social
need
it
meets
fine
work
is
done
by
workers
amazingly
dwarfed
and
neat
some
i
could
hold
on
the
palm
of
my
hand
there
is
even
a
sort
of
turnspit
selenite
very
common
whose
duty
and
only
delight
it
is
to
apply
the
motive
power
for
various
small
appliances
and
to
rule
over
these
things
and
order
any
erring
tendency
there
might
be
in
some
aberrant
natures
are
the
most
muscular
beings
i
have
seen
in
the
moon
a
sort
of
lunar
police
who
must
have
been
trained
from
their
earliest
years
to
give
a
perfect
respect
and
obedience
to
the
swollen
heads
making
of
these
various
sorts
of
operative
must
be
a
very
curious
and
interesting
process
i
am
very
much
in
the
dark
about
it
but
quite
recently
i
came
upon
a
number
of
young
selenites
confined
in
jars
from
which
only
the
protruded
who
were
being
compressed
to
become
of
a
special
sort
the
extended
in
this
highly
developed
system
of
technical
education
is
stimulated
by
irritants
and
nourished
by
injection
while
the
rest
of
the
body
is
starved
unless
i
misunderstood
him
explained
that
in
the
earlier
stages
these
queer
little
creatures
are
apt
to
display
signs
of
suffering
in
their
various
cramped
situations
but
they
easily
become
indurated
to
their
lot
and
he
took
me
on
to
where
a
number
of
messengers
were
being
drawn
out
and
broken
in
it
is
quite
unreasonable
i
know
but
such
glimpses
of
the
educational
methods
of
these
beings
affect
me
disagreeably
i
hope
however
that
may
pass
off
and
i
may
be
able
to
see
more
of
this
aspect
of
their
wonderful
social
order
that
sticking
out
of
its
jar
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
limp
appeal
for
lost
possibilities
it
haunts
me
still
although
of
course
it
is
really
in
the
end
a
far
more
humane
proceeding
than
our
earthly
method
of
leaving
children
to
grow
into
human
beings
and
then
making
machines
of
them
recently
think
it
was
on
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
visit
i
made
to
this
had
a
curious
light
upon
the
lives
of
these
operatives
i
was
being
guided
through
a
short
cut
hither
instead
of
going
down
the
spiral
and
by
the
quays
to
the
central
sea
from
the
devious
windings
of
a
long
dark
gallery
we
emerged
into
a
vast
low
cavern
pervaded
by
an
earthy
smell
and
as
things
go
in
this
darkness
rather
brightly
lit
the
light
came
from
a
tumultuous
growth
of
livid
fungoid
indeed
singularly
like
our
terrestrial
mushrooms
but
standing
as
high
or
higher
than
a
man
eat
these
said
i
to
me
i
cried
that
eye
had
just
caught
the
figure
of
an
exceptionally
big
and
ungainly
selenite
lying
motionless
among
the
stems
face
downward
we
stopped
i
asked
for
as
yet
i
have
seen
no
dead
in
the
moon
and
i
have
grown
curious
exclaimed
work
to
do
get
little
drink
we
him
want
what
good
him
wake
eh
no
want
him
walking
another
cried
i
indeed
all
that
huge
extent
of
mushroom
ground
was
i
found
peppered
with
these
prostrate
figures
sleeping
under
an
opiate
until
the
moon
had
need
of
them
there
were
scores
of
them
of
all
sorts
and
we
were
able
to
turn
over
some
of
them
and
examine
them
more
precisely
than
i
had
been
able
to
do
previously
they
breathed
noisily
at
my
doing
so
but
did
not
wake
one
i
remember
very
distinctly
he
left
a
strong
impression
i
think
because
some
trick
of
the
light
and
of
his
attitude
was
strongly
suggestive
of
a
human
figure
his
were
long
delicate
was
some
kind
of
refined
the
pose
of
his
slumber
suggested
a
submissive
suffering
no
doubt
it
was
a
mistake
for
me
to
interpret
his
expression
in
that
way
but
i
did
and
as
rolled
him
over
into
the
darkness
among
the
livid
fleshiness
again
i
felt
a
distinctly
unpleasant
sensation
although
as
he
rolled
the
insect
in
him
was
confessed
simply
illustrates
the
unthinking
way
in
which
one
acquires
habits
of
feeling
to
drug
the
worker
one
does
not
want
and
toss
him
aside
is
surely
far
better
than
to
expel
him
from
his
factory
to
wander
starving
in
the
streets
in
every
complicated
social
community
there
is
necessarily
a
certain
intermittency
of
employment
for
all
specialised
labour
and
in
this
way
the
trouble
of
an
problem
is
altogether
anticipated
and
yet
so
unreasonable
are
even
scientifically
trained
minds
i
still
do
not
like
the
memory
of
those
prostrate
forms
amidst
those
quiet
luminous
arcades
of
fleshy
growth
and
i
avoid
that
short
cut
in
spite
of
the
inconveniences
of
the
longer
more
noisy
and
more
crowded
alternative
alternative
route
takes
me
round
by
a
huge
shadowy
cavern
very
crowded
and
clamorous
and
here
it
is
i
see
peering
out
of
the
hexagonal
openings
of
a
sort
of
honeycomb
wall
or
parading
a
large
open
space
behind
or
selecting
the
toys
and
amulets
made
to
please
them
by
the
jewellers
who
work
in
kennels
below
the
mothers
of
the
moon
queen
bees
as
it
were
of
the
hive
they
are
beings
fantastically
and
sometimes
quite
beautifully
adorned
with
a
proud
carriage
and
save
for
their
mouths
almost
microscopic
heads
the
condition
of
the
moon
sexes
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
and
of
birth
and
so
forth
among
the
selenites
i
have
as
yet
been
able
to
learn
very
little
with
the
steady
progress
of
in
english
however
my
ignorance
will
no
doubt
as
steadily
disappear
i
am
of
opinion
that
as
with
the
ants
and
bees
there
is
a
large
majority
of
the
members
in
this
community
of
the
neuter
sex
of
course
on
earth
in
our
cities
there
are
now
many
who
never
live
that
life
of
parentage
which
is
the
natural
life
of
man
here
as
with
the
ants
this
thing
has
become
a
normal
condition
of
the
race
and
the
whole
of
such
replacement
as
is
necessary
falls
upon
this
special
and
by
no
means
numerous
class
of
matrons
the
mothers
of
the
large
and
stately
beings
beautifully
fitted
to
bear
the
larval
selenite
unless
i
misunderstand
an
explanation
of
they
are
absolutely
incapable
of
cherishing
the
young
they
bring
into
the
moon
periods
of
foolish
indulgence
alternate
with
moods
of
aggressive
violence
and
as
soon
as
possible
the
little
creatures
who
are
quite
soft
and
flabby
and
pale
coloured
are
transferred
to
the
charge
of
celibate
females
women
as
it
were
who
in
some
cases
possess
brains
of
almost
masculine
just
at
this
point
unhappily
this
message
broke
off
fragmentary
and
tantalising
as
the
matter
constituting
this
chapter
is
it
does
nevertheless
give
a
vague
broad
impression
of
an
altogether
strange
and
wonderful
world
with
which
our
own
may
have
to
reckon
we
know
not
how
speedily
this
intermittent
trickle
of
messages
this
whispering
of
a
record
needle
in
the
stillness
of
the
mountain
slopes
is
the
first
warning
of
such
a
change
in
human
conditions
as
mankind
has
scarcely
imagined
heretofore
in
that
satellite
of
ours
there
are
new
elements
new
appliances
traditions
an
overwhelming
avalanche
of
new
ideas
a
strange
race
with
whom
we
must
inevitably
struggle
for
as
common
as
iron
or
wood
xxv
the
grand
lunar
the
penultimate
message
describes
with
occasionally
elaborate
detail
the
encounter
between
cavor
and
the
grand
lunar
who
is
the
ruler
or
master
of
the
moon
cavor
seems
to
have
sent
most
of
it
without
interference
but
to
have
been
interrupted
in
the
concluding
portion
the
second
came
after
an
interval
of
a
week
the
first
message
begins
last
i
am
able
to
resume
it
then
becomes
illegible
for
a
space
and
after
a
time
resumed
in
the
missing
words
of
the
following
sentence
are
probably
there
follows
quite
clearly
ever
denser
as
we
drew
near
the
palace
of
the
grand
i
may
call
a
series
of
excavations
a
palace
everywhere
faces
stared
at
chitinous
gapes
and
masks
eyes
peering
over
tremendous
olfactory
developments
eyes
beneath
monstrous
forehead
plates
and
undergrowth
of
smaller
creatures
dodged
and
yelped
and
helmet
faces
poised
on
sinuous
necks
appeared
craning
over
shoulders
and
beneath
armpits
keeping
a
welcome
space
about
me
marched
a
cordon
of
stolid
guards
who
had
joined
us
on
our
leaving
the
boat
in
which
we
had
come
along
the
channels
of
the
central
sea
the
artist
with
the
little
brain
joined
us
also
and
a
thick
bunch
of
lean
swayed
and
struggled
under
the
multitude
of
conveniences
that
were
considered
essential
to
my
state
i
was
carried
in
a
litter
during
the
final
stage
of
our
journey
this
litter
was
made
of
some
very
ductile
metal
that
looked
dark
to
me
meshed
and
woven
and
with
bars
of
paler
metal
and
about
me
as
i
advanced
there
grouped
itself
a
long
and
complicated
procession
front
after
the
manner
of
heralds
marched
four
creatures
making
a
devastating
bray
and
then
came
squat
ushers
before
and
behind
and
on
either
hand
a
galaxy
of
learned
heads
a
sort
of
animated
encyclopedia
who
were
explained
to
stand
about
the
grand
lunar
for
purposes
of
reference
not
a
thing
in
lunar
science
not
a
point
of
view
or
method
of
thinking
that
these
wonderful
beings
did
not
carry
in
their
heads
followed
guards
and
porters
and
then
shivering
brain
borne
also
on
a
litter
then
came
in
a
slightly
less
important
litter
then
myself
on
a
litter
of
greater
elegance
than
any
other
and
surrounded
by
my
food
and
drink
attendants
more
trumpeters
came
next
splitting
the
ear
with
vehement
outcries
and
then
several
big
brains
special
correspondents
one
might
well
call
them
or
historiographers
charged
with
the
task
of
observing
and
remembering
every
detail
of
this
interview
a
company
of
attendants
bearing
and
dragging
banners
and
masses
of
scented
fungus
and
curious
symbols
vanished
in
the
darkness
behind
the
way
was
lined
by
ushers
and
officers
in
caparisons
that
gleamed
like
steel
and
beyond
their
line
so
far
as
my
eyes
could
pierce
the
gloom
the
heads
of
that
enormous
crowd
extended
will
own
that
i
am
still
by
no
means
indurated
to
the
peculiar
effect
of
the
selenite
appearance
and
to
find
myself
as
it
were
adrift
on
this
broad
sea
of
excited
entomology
was
by
no
means
agreeable
just
for
a
space
i
had
something
very
like
what
i
should
imagine
people
mean
when
they
speak
of
the
it
had
come
to
me
before
in
these
lunar
caverns
when
on
occasion
i
have
found
myself
weaponless
and
with
an
undefended
back
amidst
a
crowd
of
these
selenites
but
never
quite
so
vividly
it
is
of
course
as
absolutely
irrational
a
feeling
as
one
could
well
have
and
i
hope
gradually
to
subdue
it
but
just
for
a
moment
as
i
swept
forward
into
the
welter
of
the
vast
crowd
it
was
only
by
gripping
my
litter
tightly
and
summoning
all
my
that
i
succeeded
in
avoiding
an
outcry
or
some
such
manifestation
it
lasted
perhaps
three
minutes
then
i
had
myself
in
hand
again
ascended
the
spiral
of
a
vertical
way
for
some
time
and
then
passed
through
a
series
of
huge
halls
and
elaborately
decorated
the
approach
to
the
grand
lunar
was
certainly
contrived
to
give
one
a
vivid
impression
of
his
greatness
each
cavern
one
entered
seemed
greater
and
more
boldly
arched
than
its
predecessor
this
effect
of
progressive
size
was
enhanced
by
a
thin
haze
of
faintly
phosphorescent
blue
incense
that
thickened
as
one
advanced
and
robbed
even
the
nearer
figures
of
clearness
i
seemed
to
advance
continually
to
something
larger
dimmer
and
less
material
must
confess
that
all
this
multitude
made
me
feel
extremely
shabby
and
unworthy
i
was
unshaven
and
unkempt
i
had
brought
no
razor
i
had
a
coarse
beard
over
my
mouth
on
earth
i
have
always
been
inclined
to
despise
any
attention
to
my
person
beyond
a
proper
care
for
cleanliness
but
under
the
exceptional
circumstances
in
which
i
found
myself
representing
as
i
did
my
planet
and
my
kind
and
depending
very
largely
upon
the
attractiveness
of
my
appearance
for
a
proper
reception
i
could
have
given
much
for
something
a
little
more
artistic
and
dignified
than
the
husks
i
wore
i
had
been
so
serene
in
the
belief
that
the
moon
was
uninhabited
as
to
overlook
such
precautions
altogether
as
it
was
i
was
dressed
in
a
flannel
jacket
knickerbockers
and
golfing
stockings
stained
with
every
sort
of
dirt
the
moon
offered
slippers
of
which
the
left
heel
was
wanting
and
a
blanket
through
a
hole
in
which
i
thrust
my
head
these
clothes
indeed
i
still
wear
sharp
bristles
are
anything
but
an
improvement
to
my
cast
of
features
and
there
was
an
unmended
tear
at
the
knee
of
my
knickerbockers
that
showed
conspicuously
as
i
squatted
in
my
litter
my
right
stocking
too
persisted
in
getting
about
my
ankle
i
am
fully
alive
to
the
injustice
my
appearance
did
humanity
and
if
by
any
expedient
i
could
have
improvised
something
a
little
out
of
the
way
and
imposing
i
would
have
done
so
but
i
could
hit
upon
nothing
i
did
what
i
could
with
my
it
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
toga
and
for
the
rest
i
sat
as
upright
as
the
swaying
of
my
litter
permitted
the
largest
hall
you
have
ever
been
in
imperfectly
lit
with
blue
light
and
obscured
by
a
fog
surging
with
metallic
or
creatures
of
such
a
mad
diversity
as
i
have
hinted
imagine
this
hall
to
end
in
an
open
archway
beyond
which
is
a
still
larger
hall
and
beyond
this
yet
another
and
still
larger
one
and
so
on
at
the
end
of
the
vista
dimly
seen
a
flight
of
steps
like
the
steps
of
ara
coeli
at
rome
ascend
out
of
sight
higher
and
higher
these
steps
appear
to
go
as
one
draws
nearer
their
base
but
at
last
i
came
under
a
huge
archway
and
beheld
the
summit
of
these
steps
and
upon
it
the
grand
lunar
exalted
on
his
throne
was
seated
in
what
was
relatively
a
blaze
of
incandescent
blue
this
and
the
darkness
about
him
gave
him
an
effect
of
floating
in
a
void
he
seemed
a
small
cloud
at
first
brooding
on
his
sombre
throne
his
brain
case
must
have
measured
many
yards
in
diameter
for
some
reason
that
i
can
not
fathom
a
number
of
blue
radiated
from
behind
the
throne
on
which
he
sat
and
immediately
encircling
him
was
a
halo
about
him
and
little
and
indistinct
in
this
glow
a
number
of
sustained
and
supported
him
and
overshadowed
and
standing
in
a
huge
semicircle
beneath
him
were
his
intellectual
subordinates
his
remembrancers
and
computators
and
searchers
and
servants
and
all
the
distinguished
insects
of
the
court
of
the
moon
still
lower
stood
ushers
and
messengers
and
then
all
down
the
countless
steps
of
the
throne
were
guards
and
at
the
base
enormous
various
indistinct
vanishing
at
last
into
an
absolute
black
a
vast
swaying
multitude
of
the
minor
dignitaries
of
the
moon
their
feet
made
a
perpetual
scraping
whisper
on
the
rocky
floor
as
their
limbs
moved
with
a
rustling
murmur
i
entered
the
penultimate
hall
the
music
rose
and
expanded
into
an
imperial
magnificence
of
sound
and
the
shrieks
of
the
died
away
entered
the
last
and
greatest
hall
procession
opened
out
like
a
fan
my
ushers
and
guards
went
right
and
left
and
the
three
litters
bearing
myself
and
and
marched
across
a
shiny
darkness
of
floor
to
the
foot
of
the
giant
stairs
then
began
a
vast
throbbing
hum
that
mingled
with
the
music
the
two
selenites
dismounted
but
i
was
bidden
remain
imagine
as
a
special
honour
the
music
ceased
but
not
that
humming
and
by
a
simultaneous
movement
of
ten
thousand
respectful
heads
my
attention
was
directed
to
the
enhaloed
supreme
intelligence
that
hovered
above
me
first
as
i
peered
into
the
radiating
glow
this
quintessential
brain
looked
very
much
like
an
opaque
featureless
bladder
with
dim
undulating
ghosts
of
convolutions
writhing
visibly
within
then
beneath
its
enormity
and
just
above
the
edge
of
the
throne
one
saw
with
a
start
minute
elfin
eyes
peering
out
of
the
glow
no
face
but
eyes
as
if
they
peered
through
holes
at
first
i
could
see
no
more
than
these
two
staring
little
eyes
and
then
below
i
distinguished
the
little
dwarfed
body
and
its
limbs
shrivelled
and
white
the
eyes
stared
down
at
me
with
a
strange
intensity
and
the
lower
part
of
the
swollen
globe
was
wrinkled
little
steadied
this
shape
on
the
throne
was
great
it
was
pitiful
one
forgot
the
hall
and
the
crowd
ascended
the
staircase
by
jerks
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
darkly
glowing
brain
case
above
us
spread
over
me
and
took
more
and
more
of
the
whole
effect
into
itself
as
i
drew
nearer
the
tiers
of
attendants
and
helpers
grouped
about
their
master
seemed
to
dwindle
and
fade
into
the
night
i
saw
that
shadowy
attendants
were
busy
spraying
that
great
brain
with
a
cooling
spray
and
patting
and
sustaining
it
for
my
own
part
i
sat
gripping
my
swaying
litter
and
staring
at
the
grand
lunar
unable
to
turn
my
gaze
aside
and
at
last
as
i
reached
a
little
landing
that
was
separated
only
by
ten
steps
or
so
from
the
supreme
seat
the
woven
splendour
of
the
music
reached
a
climax
and
ceased
and
i
was
left
naked
as
it
were
in
that
vastness
beneath
the
still
scrutiny
of
the
grand
eyes
was
scrutinising
the
first
man
he
had
ever
seen
eyes
dropped
at
last
from
his
greatness
to
the
ant
figures
in
the
blue
mist
about
him
and
then
down
the
steps
to
the
massed
selenites
still
and
expectant
in
their
thousands
packed
on
the
floor
below
once
again
an
unreasonable
horror
reached
out
towards
me
and
passed
the
pause
came
the
salutation
i
was
assisted
from
my
litter
and
stood
awkwardly
while
a
number
of
curious
and
no
doubt
deeply
symbolical
gestures
were
vicariously
performed
for
me
by
two
slender
officials
the
encyclopaedic
galaxy
of
the
learned
that
had
accompanied
me
to
the
entrance
of
the
last
hall
appeared
two
steps
above
me
and
left
and
right
of
me
in
readiness
for
the
grand
need
and
pale
brain
placed
itself
about
up
to
the
throne
in
such
a
position
as
to
communicate
easily
between
us
without
turning
his
back
on
either
the
grand
lunar
or
myself
took
up
a
position
behind
him
dexterous
ushers
sidled
sideways
towards
me
keeping
a
full
face
to
the
presence
i
seated
myself
turkish
fashion
and
and
also
knelt
down
above
me
there
came
a
pause
the
eyes
of
the
nearer
court
went
from
me
to
the
grand
lunar
and
came
back
to
me
and
a
hissing
and
piping
of
expectation
passed
across
the
hidden
multitudes
below
and
ceased
humming
ceased
the
first
and
last
time
in
my
experience
the
moon
was
silent
became
aware
of
a
faint
wheezy
noise
the
grand
lunar
was
addressing
me
it
was
like
the
rubbing
of
a
finger
upon
a
pane
of
glass
watched
him
attentively
for
a
time
and
then
glanced
at
the
alert
i
felt
amidst
these
slender
beings
ridiculously
thick
and
fleshy
and
solid
my
head
all
jaw
and
black
hair
my
eyes
went
back
to
the
grand
lunar
he
had
ceased
his
attendants
were
busy
and
his
shining
superficies
was
glistening
and
running
with
cooling
spray
meditated
through
an
interval
he
consulted
then
he
began
piping
his
recognisable
first
a
little
nervously
so
that
he
was
not
very
clear
grand
to
to
gathers
you
you
are
a
man
from
the
planet
earth
he
wishes
to
say
that
he
welcomes
wishes
to
if
i
may
use
the
state
of
your
world
and
the
reason
why
you
came
to
paused
i
was
about
to
reply
when
he
resumed
he
proceeded
to
remarks
of
which
the
drift
was
not
very
clear
though
i
am
inclined
to
think
they
were
intended
to
be
complimentary
he
told
me
that
the
earth
was
to
the
moon
what
the
sun
is
to
the
earth
and
that
the
selenites
desired
very
greatly
to
learn
about
the
earth
and
men
he
then
told
me
no
doubt
in
compliment
also
the
relative
magnitude
and
diameter
of
earth
and
moon
and
the
perpetual
wonder
and
speculation
with
which
the
selenites
had
regarded
our
planet
i
meditated
with
downcast
eyes
and
decided
to
reply
that
men
too
had
wondered
what
might
lie
in
the
moon
and
had
judged
it
dead
little
recking
of
such
magnificence
as
i
had
seen
that
day
the
grand
lunar
in
token
of
recognition
caused
his
long
blue
rays
to
rotate
in
a
very
confusing
manner
and
all
about
the
great
hall
ran
the
pipings
and
whisperings
and
rustlings
of
the
report
of
what
i
had
said
he
then
proceeded
to
put
to
a
number
of
inquiries
which
were
easier
to
answer
understood
he
explained
that
we
lived
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
that
our
air
and
sea
were
outside
the
globe
the
latter
part
indeed
he
already
knew
from
his
astronomical
specialists
he
was
very
anxious
to
have
more
detailed
information
of
what
he
called
this
extraordinary
state
of
affairs
for
from
the
solidity
of
the
earth
there
had
always
been
a
disposition
to
regard
it
as
uninhabitable
he
endeavoured
first
to
ascertain
the
extremes
of
temperature
to
which
we
earth
beings
were
exposed
and
he
was
deeply
interested
by
my
descriptive
treatment
of
clouds
and
rain
his
imagination
was
assisted
by
the
fact
that
the
lunar
atmosphere
in
the
outer
galleries
of
the
night
side
is
not
infrequently
very
foggy
he
seemed
inclined
to
marvel
that
we
did
not
find
the
sunlight
too
intense
for
our
eyes
and
was
interested
in
my
attempt
to
explain
that
the
sky
was
tempered
to
a
bluish
colour
through
the
refraction
of
the
air
though
i
doubt
if
he
clearly
understood
that
i
explained
how
the
iris
of
the
human
eyes
can
contract
the
pupil
and
save
the
delicate
internal
structure
from
the
excess
of
sunlight
and
was
allowed
to
approach
within
a
few
feet
of
the
presence
in
order
that
this
structure
might
be
seen
this
led
to
a
comparison
of
the
lunar
and
terrestrial
eyes
the
former
is
not
only
excessively
sensitive
to
such
light
as
men
can
see
but
it
can
also
heat
and
every
difference
in
temperature
within
the
moon
renders
objects
visible
to
it
iris
was
quite
a
new
organ
to
the
grand
lunar
for
a
time
he
amused
himself
by
flashing
his
rays
into
my
face
and
watching
my
pupils
contract
as
a
consequence
i
was
dazzled
and
blinded
for
some
little
time
in
spite
of
that
discomfort
i
found
something
reassuring
by
insensible
degrees
in
the
rationality
of
this
business
of
question
and
answer
i
could
shut
my
eyes
think
of
my
answer
and
almost
forget
that
the
the
grand
lunar
has
no
face
i
had
descended
again
to
my
proper
place
the
grand
lunar
asked
how
we
sheltered
ourselves
from
heat
and
storms
and
i
expounded
to
him
the
arts
of
building
and
furnishing
here
we
wandered
into
misunderstandings
and
due
largely
i
must
admit
to
the
looseness
of
my
expressions
for
a
long
time
i
had
great
difficulty
in
making
him
understand
the
nature
of
a
house
to
him
and
his
attendant
selenites
it
seemed
no
doubt
the
most
whimsical
thing
in
the
world
that
men
should
build
houses
when
they
might
descend
into
excavations
and
an
additional
complication
was
introduced
by
the
attempt
i
made
to
explain
that
men
had
originally
begun
their
homes
in
caves
and
that
they
were
now
taking
their
railways
and
many
establishments
beneath
the
surface
here
i
think
a
desire
for
intellectual
completeness
betrayed
me
there
was
also
a
considerable
tangle
due
to
an
equally
unwise
attempt
on
my
part
to
explain
about
mines
dismissing
this
topic
at
last
in
an
incomplete
state
the
grand
lunar
inquired
what
we
did
with
the
interior
of
our
globe
tide
of
twittering
and
piping
swept
into
the
remotest
corners
of
that
great
assembly
when
it
was
at
last
made
clear
that
we
men
know
absolutely
nothing
of
the
contents
of
the
world
upon
which
the
immemorial
generations
of
our
ancestors
had
been
evolved
three
times
had
i
to
repeat
that
of
all
the
miles
of
distance
between
the
earth
and
its
centre
men
knew
only
to
the
depth
of
a
mile
and
that
very
vaguely
i
understood
the
grand
lunar
to
ask
why
had
i
come
to
the
moon
seeing
we
had
scarcely
touched
our
own
planet
yet
but
he
did
not
trouble
me
at
that
time
to
proceed
to
an
explanation
being
too
anxious
to
pursue
the
details
of
this
mad
inversion
of
all
his
ideas
reverted
to
the
question
of
weather
and
i
tried
to
describe
the
perpetually
changing
sky
and
snow
and
frost
and
hurricanes
when
the
night
comes
he
asked
it
not
cold
told
him
it
was
colder
than
by
day
does
not
your
atmosphere
freeze
told
him
not
that
it
was
never
cold
enough
for
that
because
our
nights
were
so
short
even
liquefy
was
about
to
say
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
one
part
at
least
of
our
atmosphere
the
water
vapour
of
it
does
sometimes
liquefy
and
form
dew
and
sometimes
freeze
and
form
process
perfectly
analogous
to
the
freezing
of
all
the
external
atmosphere
of
the
moon
during
its
longer
night
i
made
myself
clear
on
this
point
and
from
that
the
grand
lunar
went
on
to
speak
with
me
of
sleep
for
the
need
of
sleep
that
comes
so
regularly
every
hours
to
all
things
is
part
also
of
our
earthly
inheritance
on
the
moon
they
rest
only
at
rare
intervals
and
after
exceptional
exertions
then
i
tried
to
describe
to
him
the
soft
splendours
of
a
summer
night
and
from
that
i
passed
to
a
description
of
those
animals
that
prowl
by
night
and
sleep
by
day
i
told
him
of
lions
and
tigers
and
here
it
seemed
as
though
we
had
come
to
a
deadlock
for
save
in
their
waters
there
are
no
creatures
in
the
moon
not
absolutely
domestic
and
subject
to
his
will
and
so
it
has
been
for
immemorial
years
they
have
monstrous
water
creatures
but
no
evil
beasts
and
the
idea
of
anything
strong
and
large
existing
in
the
night
is
very
difficult
for
them
the
record
is
here
too
broken
to
transcribe
for
the
space
of
perhaps
twenty
words
or
more
talked
with
his
attendants
as
i
suppose
upon
the
strange
superficiality
and
unreasonableness
of
man
who
lives
on
the
mere
surface
of
a
world
a
creature
of
waves
and
winds
and
all
the
chances
of
space
who
can
not
even
unite
to
overcome
the
beasts
that
prey
upon
his
kind
and
yet
who
dares
to
invade
another
planet
during
this
aside
i
sat
thinking
and
then
at
his
desire
i
told
him
of
the
different
sorts
of
men
he
searched
me
with
questions
for
all
sorts
of
work
you
have
the
same
sort
of
men
but
who
thinks
who
governs
gave
him
an
outline
of
the
democratic
method
i
had
done
he
ordered
cooling
sprays
upon
his
brow
and
then
requested
me
to
repeat
my
explanation
conceiving
something
had
miscarried
they
not
do
different
things
then
said
i
admitted
were
thinkers
and
some
officials
some
hunted
some
were
mechanics
some
artists
some
toilers
rule
i
said
have
they
not
different
shapes
to
fit
them
to
their
different
duties
that
you
can
see
i
said
perhaps
for
clothes
their
minds
perhaps
differ
a
little
i
reflected
minds
must
differ
a
great
deal
said
the
grand
lunar
they
would
all
want
to
do
the
same
order
to
bring
myself
into
a
closer
harmony
with
his
preconceptions
i
said
that
his
surmise
was
right
was
all
hidden
in
the
brain
i
said
but
the
difference
was
there
perhaps
if
one
could
see
the
minds
and
souls
of
men
they
would
be
as
varied
and
unequal
as
the
selenites
there
were
great
men
and
small
men
men
who
could
reach
out
far
and
wide
men
who
could
go
swiftly
noisy
men
and
men
who
could
remember
without
thinking
the
record
is
indistinct
for
three
words
interrupted
me
to
recall
me
to
my
previous
statements
you
said
all
men
rule
he
pressed
a
certain
extent
i
said
and
made
i
fear
a
denser
fog
with
my
explanation
reached
out
to
a
salient
fact
you
mean
asked
there
is
no
grand
earthly
thought
of
several
people
but
assured
him
finally
there
was
none
i
explained
that
such
autocrats
and
emperors
as
we
had
tried
upon
earth
had
usually
ended
in
drink
or
vice
or
violence
and
that
the
large
and
influential
section
of
the
people
of
the
earth
to
which
i
belonged
the
did
not
mean
to
try
that
sort
of
thing
again
at
which
the
grand
lunar
was
even
more
amazed
how
do
you
keep
even
such
wisdom
as
you
have
he
asked
and
i
explained
to
him
the
way
we
helped
our
limited
a
word
omitted
here
probably
with
libraries
of
books
i
explained
to
him
how
our
science
was
growing
by
the
united
labours
of
innumerable
little
men
and
on
that
he
made
no
comment
save
that
it
was
evident
we
had
mastered
much
in
spite
of
our
social
savagery
or
we
could
not
have
come
to
the
moon
yet
the
contrast
was
very
marked
with
knowledge
the
selenites
grew
and
changed
mankind
stored
their
knowledge
about
them
and
remained
he
said
this
here
there
is
a
short
piece
of
the
record
indistinct
then
caused
me
to
describe
how
we
went
about
this
earth
of
ours
and
i
described
to
him
our
railways
and
ships
for
a
time
he
could
not
understand
that
we
had
had
the
use
of
steam
only
one
hundred
years
but
when
he
did
he
was
clearly
amazed
i
may
mention
as
a
singular
thing
that
the
selenites
use
years
to
count
by
just
as
we
do
on
earth
though
i
can
make
nothing
of
their
numeral
system
that
however
does
not
matter
because
understands
ours
from
that
i
went
on
to
tell
him
that
mankind
had
dwelt
in
cities
only
for
nine
or
ten
thousand
years
and
that
we
were
still
not
united
in
one
brotherhood
but
under
many
different
forms
of
government
this
astonished
the
grand
lunar
very
much
when
it
was
made
clear
to
him
at
first
he
thought
we
referred
merely
to
administrative
areas
states
and
empires
are
still
the
rawest
sketches
of
what
order
will
some
day
be
i
said
and
so
i
came
to
tell
him
at
this
point
a
length
of
record
that
probably
represents
thirty
or
forty
words
is
totally
illegible
grand
lunar
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
folly
of
men
in
clinging
to
the
inconvenience
of
diverse
tongues
want
to
communicate
and
yet
not
to
communicate
he
said
and
then
for
a
long
time
he
questioned
me
closely
concerning
war
was
at
first
perplexed
and
incredulous
mean
to
say
he
asked
seeking
confirmation
you
run
about
over
the
surface
of
your
world
whose
riches
you
have
scarcely
begun
to
one
another
for
beasts
to
eat
told
him
that
was
perfectly
correct
asked
for
particulars
to
assist
his
imagination
do
not
ships
and
your
poor
little
cities
get
injured
he
asked
and
i
found
the
waste
of
property
and
conveniences
seemed
to
impress
him
almost
as
much
as
the
killing
me
more
said
the
grand
lunar
me
see
pictures
i
can
not
conceive
these
so
for
a
space
though
something
loath
i
told
him
the
story
of
earthly
war
told
him
of
the
first
orders
and
ceremonies
of
war
of
warnings
and
ultimatums
and
the
marshalling
and
marching
of
troops
i
gave
him
an
idea
of
manoeuvres
and
positions
and
battle
joined
i
told
him
of
sieges
and
assaults
of
starvation
and
hardship
in
trenches
and
of
sentinels
freezing
in
the
snow
i
told
him
of
routs
and
surprises
and
desperate
last
stands
and
faint
hopes
and
the
pitiless
pursuit
of
fugitives
and
the
dead
upon
the
field
i
told
too
of
the
past
of
invasions
and
massacres
of
the
huns
and
tartars
and
the
wars
of
mahomet
and
the
caliphs
and
of
the
crusades
and
as
i
went
on
and
translated
the
selenites
cooed
and
murmured
in
a
steadily
intensified
emotion
told
them
an
ironclad
could
fire
a
shot
of
a
ton
twelve
miles
and
go
through
feet
of
how
we
could
steer
torpedoes
under
water
i
went
on
to
describe
a
maxim
gun
in
action
and
what
i
could
imagine
of
the
battle
of
colenso
the
grand
lunar
was
so
incredulous
that
he
interrupted
the
translation
of
what
i
had
said
in
order
to
have
my
verification
of
my
account
they
particularly
doubted
my
description
of
the
men
cheering
and
rejoicing
as
they
went
into
battle
surely
they
do
not
like
it
translated
assured
them
men
of
my
race
considered
battle
the
most
glorious
experience
of
life
at
which
the
whole
assembly
was
stricken
with
amazement
what
good
is
this
war
asked
the
grand
lunar
sticking
to
his
theme
as
for
said
i
thins
the
population
why
should
there
be
a
came
a
pause
the
cooling
sprays
impinged
upon
his
brow
and
then
he
spoke
at
this
point
a
series
of
undulations
that
have
been
apparent
as
a
perplexing
complication
as
far
back
as
description
of
the
silence
that
fell
before
the
first
speaking
of
the
grand
lunar
become
confusingly
predominant
in
the
record
these
undulations
are
evidently
the
result
of
radiations
proceeding
from
a
lunar
source
and
their
persistent
approximation
to
the
alternating
signals
of
cavor
is
curiously
suggestive
of
some
operator
deliberately
seeking
to
mix
them
in
with
his
message
and
render
it
illegible
at
first
they
are
small
and
regular
so
that
with
a
little
care
and
the
loss
of
very
few
words
we
have
been
able
to
disentangle
message
then
they
become
broad
and
larger
then
suddenly
they
are
irregular
with
an
irregularity
that
gives
the
effect
at
last
of
some
one
scribbling
through
a
line
of
writing
for
a
long
time
nothing
can
be
made
of
this
madly
zigzagging
trace
then
quite
abruptly
the
interruption
ceases
leaves
a
few
words
clear
and
then
resumes
and
continues
for
the
rest
of
the
message
completely
obliterating
whatever
cavor
was
attempting
to
transmit
why
if
this
is
indeed
a
deliberate
intervention
the
selenites
should
have
preferred
to
let
cavor
go
on
transmitting
his
message
in
happy
ignorance
of
their
obliteration
of
its
record
when
it
was
clearly
quite
in
their
power
and
much
more
easy
and
convenient
for
them
to
stop
his
proceedings
at
any
time
is
a
problem
to
which
i
can
contribute
nothing
the
thing
seems
to
have
happened
so
and
that
is
all
i
can
say
this
last
rag
of
his
description
of
the
grand
lunar
begins
in
interrogated
me
very
closely
upon
my
secret
i
was
able
in
a
little
while
to
get
to
an
understanding
with
them
and
at
last
to
elucidate
what
has
been
a
puzzle
to
me
ever
since
i
realised
the
vastness
of
their
science
namely
how
it
is
they
themselves
have
never
discovered
i
find
they
know
of
it
as
a
theoretical
substance
but
they
have
always
regarded
it
as
a
practical
impossibility
because
for
some
reason
there
is
no
helium
in
the
moon
and
helium
across
the
last
letters
of
helium
slashes
the
resumption
of
that
obliterating
trace
note
that
word
for
on
that
and
that
alone
i
base
my
interpretation
of
the
message
that
follows
the
last
message
as
both
wendigee
and
myself
now
believe
it
to
be
that
he
is
ever
likely
to
send
us
xxvi
the
last
message
cavor
sent
to
the
earth
on
this
unsatisfactory
manner
the
penultimate
message
of
cavor
dies
out
one
seems
to
see
him
away
there
in
the
blue
obscurity
amidst
his
apparatus
intently
signalling
us
to
the
last
all
unaware
of
the
curtain
of
confusion
that
drops
between
us
all
unaware
too
of
the
final
dangers
that
even
then
must
have
been
creeping
upon
him
his
disastrous
want
of
vulgar
common
sense
had
utterly
betrayed
him
he
had
talked
of
war
he
had
talked
of
all
the
strength
and
irrational
violence
of
men
of
their
insatiable
aggressions
their
tireless
futility
of
conflict
he
had
filled
the
whole
moon
world
with
this
impression
of
our
race
and
then
i
think
it
is
plain
that
he
made
the
most
fatal
admission
that
upon
himself
alone
hung
the
least
for
a
long
any
further
men
reaching
the
moon
the
line
the
cold
inhuman
reason
of
the
moon
would
take
seems
plain
enough
to
me
and
a
suspicion
of
it
and
then
perhaps
some
sudden
sharp
realisation
of
it
must
have
come
to
him
one
imagines
him
about
the
moon
with
the
remorse
of
this
fatal
indiscretion
growing
in
his
mind
during
a
certain
time
i
am
inclined
to
guess
the
grand
lunar
was
deliberating
the
new
situation
and
for
all
that
time
cavor
may
have
gone
as
free
as
ever
he
had
gone
but
obstacles
of
some
sort
prevented
his
getting
to
his
electromagnetic
apparatus
again
after
that
message
i
have
just
given
for
some
days
we
received
nothing
perhaps
he
was
having
fresh
audiences
and
trying
to
evade
his
previous
admissions
who
can
hope
to
guess
and
then
suddenly
like
a
cry
in
the
night
like
a
cry
that
is
followed
by
a
stillness
came
the
last
message
it
is
the
briefest
fragment
the
broken
beginnings
of
two
sentences
the
first
was
was
mad
to
let
the
grand
lunar
there
was
an
interval
of
perhaps
a
minute
one
imagines
some
interruption
from
without
a
departure
from
the
dreadful
hesitation
among
the
looming
masses
of
apparatus
in
that
dim
sudden
rush
back
to
it
full
of
a
resolve
that
came
too
late
then
as
if
it
were
hastily
transmitted
came
made
as
follows
there
followed
one
word
a
quite
unmeaning
word
as
it
stands
and
that
is
all
it
may
be
he
made
a
hasty
attempt
to
spell
when
his
fate
was
close
upon
him
whatever
it
was
that
was
happening
about
that
apparatus
we
can
not
tell
whatever
it
was
we
shall
never
i
know
receive
another
message
from
the
moon
for
my
own
part
a
vivid
dream
has
come
to
my
help
and
i
see
almost
as
plainly
as
though
i
had
seen
it
in
actual
fact
a
shadowy
dishevelled
cavor
struggling
in
the
grip
of
these
insect
selenites
struggling
ever
more
desperately
and
hopelessly
as
they
press
upon
him
shouting
expostulating
perhaps
even
at
last
fighting
and
being
forced
backwards
step
by
step
out
of
all
speech
or
sign
of
his
fellows
for
evermore
into
the
the
dark
into
that
silence
that
has
no
end
