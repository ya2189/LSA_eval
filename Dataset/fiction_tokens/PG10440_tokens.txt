says
he
killed
him
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
said
tutt
to
tutt
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
a
fellow
like
that
the
junior
partner
of
the
celebrated
firm
of
tutt
tutt
attorneys
and
counselors
at
law
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
yellow
checked
breeches
and
balancing
himself
upon
the
heels
of
his
boots
gazed
in
a
distressed
respectfully
inquiring
manner
at
his
distinguished
associate
yes
he
repeated
plaintively
he
do
make
any
bones
about
it
at
all
i
killed
him
says
he
i
kill
him
again
the
i
prefer
not
to
quote
his
exact
language
i
just
come
from
the
tombs
and
had
quite
a
talk
with
serafino
in
the
counsel
room
with
a
keeper
sitting
in
the
corner
watching
me
for
fear
i
slip
his
prisoner
a
saw
file
or
a
shotgun
or
a
barrel
of
poison
i
all
in
these
murder
cases
drive
me
to
drink
tutt
i
do
mind
grand
larceny
forgery
assault
or
even
manslaughter
but
murder
gets
my
goat
and
when
you
have
a
crazy
italian
for
a
client
who
says
he
glad
he
did
it
and
would
like
to
do
it
again
please
excuse
me
it
is
law
suicide
he
drew
out
a
silk
handkerchief
ornamented
with
the
colors
of
the
allies
and
wiped
his
forehead
despairingly
oh
remarked
tutt
with
entire
good
nature
he
glad
he
did
it
and
he
quite
willing
to
be
hanged
that
it
in
a
nutshell
replied
tutt
the
senior
partner
of
tutt
tutt
ran
his
bony
fingers
through
the
lank
gray
locks
over
his
left
eye
and
tilted
ceilingward
the
stogy
between
his
thin
lips
then
he
leaned
back
in
his
antique
swivel
chair
locked
his
hands
behind
his
head
elevated
his
long
legs
luxuriously
and
crossed
his
feet
upon
the
fourth
volume
of
the
american
and
english
encyclopedia
of
law
which
lay
open
upon
the
desk
at
champerty
and
maintenance
even
in
this
inelegant
and
relaxed
posture
he
somehow
managed
to
maintain
the
air
of
picturesque
dignity
which
always
made
his
tall
ungainly
figure
noticeable
in
any
courtroom
indubitably
ephraim
tutt
suggested
a
past
generation
the
suggestion
being
accentuated
by
a
slight
pedantry
of
diction
a
trifle
out
of
character
with
the
rushing
age
in
which
he
saw
fit
to
practise
his
profession
cheer
up

he
pushing
a
box
of
stogies
toward
his
partner
with
the

of
his
congress
boot
have
a
weed
since
in
the
office
of
tutt
tutt
such
an
invitation
like
those
of
royalty
was
equivalent
to
a
command
tutt
acquiesced
thank
you
tutt
said
tutt
looking
about
vaguely
for
a
match
that
conscienceless
brat
of
a
willie
steals
all
growled
tutt
ring
the
bell
tutt
obeyed
he
was
a
short
brisk
little
man
with
a
pronounced
abdominal
convexity
and
he
maintained
toward
his
superior
though
but
a
few
years
his
junior
a
mingled
attitude
of
awe
admiration
and
affection
such
as
a
dickey
bird
might
adopt
toward
a
distinguished
owl
this
attitude
was
shared
by
the
entire
office
force
inside
the
ground
glass
of
the
outer
door
ephraim
tutt
was
king
to
tutt
the
opinion
of
tutt
upon
any
subject
whatsoever
was
law
even
if
the
courts
might
have
held
to
the
contrary
to
tutt
he
was
the
eternal
fount
of
wisdom
culture
and
morality
yet
until
tutt
finally
elucidated
his
views
tutt
did
not
hesitate
to
hold
conditional
if
temporary
opinions
of
his
own
briefly
their
relations
were
symbolized
by
the
circumstance
that
while
tutt
always
addressed
his
senior
partner
as
tutt
the
latter
accosted
him
simply
as
tutt
in
a
word
there
was
only
one
tutt
in
the
firm
of
tutt
tutt
but
so
far
as
that
went
there
was
only
one
tutt
on
the
theory
that
a
lily
can
not
be
painted
the
estate
of
one
seemingly
was
as
dignified
as
that
of
the
other
at
any
rate
there
never
was
and
never
had
been
any
confusion
or
ambiguity
arising
out
of
the
matter
since
the
day
twenty
years
before
when
tutt
had
visited
tutt
law
office
in
search
of
employment
tutt
was
just
rising
into
fame
as
a
lawyer
tutt
had
only
recently
been
admitted
to
the
bar
having
abandoned
his
native
city
of
bangor
maine
for
the
metropolis
and
may
i
ask
why
you
should
come
to
me
tutt
had
demanded
severely
from
behind
the
stogy
which
even
at
that
early
date
had
been
as
much
a
part
of
his
facial
anatomy
as
his
long
ruminative
nose
why
the
devil
should
you
come
to
me
i
am
nobody
sir
nobody
in
this
great
city
certainly
there
are
thousands
far
more
qualified
than
i
to
further
your
professional
and
financial
advancement
because
answered
the
inspired
tutt
with
modesty
i
feel
that
with
you
i
should
be
associated
with
a
good
name
that
had
settled
the
matter
they
bore
no
relationship
to
one
another
but
they
were
the
only
tutts
in
the
city
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
certain
propriety
in
their
hanging
together
neither
had
regretted
it
for
a
moment
and
as
the
years
passed
they
became
indispensable
to
each
other
they
were
the
necessary
component
parts
of
a
harmonious
legal
whole
tutt
was
the
brains
and
the
voice
while
tutt
was
the
eyes
and
legs
of
a
combination
that
at
intervals
rare
ones
it
must
be
confessed
made
the
law
tremble
sometimes
in
fear
and
more
often
with
joy
at
first
speaking
figuratively
tutt
merely
carried
bag
rode
on
his
coat
tails
as
it
were
but
as
time
went
on
his
activity
ingenuity
and
industry
made
him
indispensable
and
led
to
a
junior
partnership
tutt
prepared
the
cases
for
tutt
to
try
both
were
well
versed
in
the
law
if
they
were
not
profound
lawyers
but
as
the
origin
of
the
firm
was
humble
their
practise
was
of
a
miscellaneous
character
never
turn
down
a
case
was
tutt
motto
our
duty
as
sworn
officers
of
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
renders
it
incumbent
upon
us
to
perform
whatever
services
our
exigencies
demand
was
tutt
way
of
putting
it
in
the
end
it
amounted
to
exactly
the
same
thing
as
a
result
in
addition
to
their
own
clientele
other
members
of
the
bar
who
found
themselves
encumbered
with
matters
which
for
one
reason
or
another
they
preferred
not
to
handle
formed
the
habit
of
turning
them
over
to
tutt
tutt
a
stream
of
peculiar
cases
flowed
through
the
office
each
leaving
behind
it
some
residuum
of
golden
dust
however
small
the
stately
or
as
an
unkind
observer
might
have
put
it
the
ramshackly
form
of
the
senior
partner
was
a
constant
figure
in
all
the
courts
from
that
of
the
coroner
on
the
one
hand
to
the
appellate
tribunals
upon
the
other
it
was
immaterial
to
him
what
the
case
was
about
whether
it
dealt
with
the
next
eventual
estate
or
the
damages
for
a
dog
bite
so
long
as
he
was
paid
and
tutt
prepared
it
hence
tutt
tutt
prospered
and
as
the
law
like
any
other
profession
requires
the
firm
acquired
a
certain
peculiar
professional
standing
of
its
own
and
enjoyed
the
good
will
of
the
bar
as
a
whole
they
had
the
reputation
of
being
sound
lawyers
if
not
overafflicted
with
a
sense
of
professional
dignity
whose
word
was
better
than
their
bond
yet
who
faithful
to
their
clients
interests
knew
no
mercy
and
gave
no
quarter
they
took
and
pressed
cases
which
other
lawyers
dared
not
touch
lest
they
should
be
defiled
and
nobody
seemed
to
think
any
the
less
of
them
for
so
doing
they
raised
points
that
made
the
refinements
of
the
ancient
schoolmen
seem
blunt
in
comparison
no
respecters
of
persons
they
harried
the
rich
and
taunted
the
powerful
and
would
have
as
soon
jailed
a
bishop
or
a
judge
as
a
pickpocket
if
he
deserved
it
between
them
they
knew
more
kinds
of
law
than
most
of
their
professional
brethren
and
as
tutt
was
a
bookworm
and
a
seeker
after
legal
and
other
lore
their
dusty
old
library
was
full
of
hidden
treasures
which
on
frequent
occasions
were
unearthed
to
entertain
the
jury
or
delight
the
bench
they
were
loyal
friends
fearsome
enemies
high
chargers
and
maintained
their
unique
position
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
at
one
time
or
another
they
had
run
close
to
the
shadowy
line
which
divides
the
ethical
from
that
which
is
not
yet
tutt
had
brought
disbarment
proceedings
against
many
lawyers
in
his
time
and
what
is
more
had
them
disbarred
leave
old
tutt
alone
was
held
sage
advice
and
when
other
lawyers
desired
to
entertain
the
judiciary
they
were
apt
to
invite
tutt
to
be
of
the
party
and
tutt
gloried
in
the
glories
of
tutt
that
it
repeated
tutt
as
he
lit
his
stogy
which
flared
up
like
a
burning
bush
the
cub
of
a
willie
having
foraged
successfully
in
the
outer
office
for
a
match
he
willing
to
be
hanged
or
damned
or
anything
else
just
for
the
sake
of
putting
a
bullet
through
the
other
fellow
what
was
the
name
of
the
unfortunate
deceased
tomasso
crocedoro
a
barber
that
is
almost
a
defense
in
itself
mused
tutt
anyhow
if
got
to
defend
angelo
for
shooting
tomasso
you
might
as
well
give
me
a
short
scenario
of
the
melodrama
by
the
way
are
we
retained
or
assigned
by
the
court
assigned
chirped
tutt
so
that
all
we
get
out
of
it
is
about
enough
to
keep
me
in
stogies
for
a
couple
of
months
and
if
he
convicted
as
of
course
he
will
be
a
good
chance
of
losing
our
reputation
as
successful
trial
counsel
why
not
beg
off
let
me
hear
the
story
first
answered
tutt
angelo
sounds
like
a
good
sport
i
have
a
mild
affection
for
him
already
he
reached
into
the
lower
compartment
of
his
desk
and
lifted
out
a
tumbler
and
a
bottle
of
malt
extract
which
he
placed
carefully
at
his
elbow
then
he
leaned
back
again
expectantly
it
is
a
simple
and
naive
story
began
tutt
seating
himself
in
the
chair
reserved
for
paying
clients
that
is
to
say
one
which
did
not
have
the
two
front
legs
sawed
off
an
inch
or
so
in
order
to
make
lingering
uncomfortable
a
plain
unvarnished
tale
our
client
is
one
who
makes
an
honest
living
by
blacking
shoes
near
the
entrance
to
the
brooklyn
bridge
he
is
one
of
several
hundred
original
tonys
who
conduct
emporiums
emporia
corrected
his
partner
pouring
out
a
tumbler
of
malt
extract
he
formed
an
attachment
for
a
certain
young
lady
went
on
tutt
undisturbed
who
had
previously
had
some
sort
of
love
affair
with
crocedoro
as
a
result
of
which
her
social
standing
had
become
slightly
impaired
in
a
word
tomasso
jilted
her
angelo
saw
pitied
and
loved
her
took
her
for
better
or
for
worse
and
married
her
for
which
interjected
tutt
he
is
entitled
to
respect
quite
so
agreed
tutt
now
tomasso
though
not
willing
to
marry
the
girl
himself
seems
to
have
resented
the
idea
of
having
anyone
else
do
so
and
accordingly
seized
every
opportunity
which
presented
itself
to
twit
angelo
about
the
matter
dog
in
the
manger
so
to
speak
nodded
tutt
he
not
only
jeered
at
angelo
for
marrying
rosalina
but
he
began
to
hang
about
his
discarded
mistress
again
and
scoff
at
her
choice
of
a
husband
but
rosalina
gave
him
the
cold
shoulder
with
the
result
that
he
became
more
and
more
insulting
to
angelo
finally
one
day
our
client
made
up
his
mind
not
to
stand
it
any
longer
secured
a
revolver
sought
out
tomasso
in
his
barber
shop
and
put
a
bullet
through
his
head
now
however
much
you
may
sympathize
with
angelo
as
a
man
and
a
husband
there
is
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
killed
tomasso
with
every
kind
of
deliberation
and
premeditation
if
the
case
is
as
you
say
replied
tutt
replacing
the
bottle
and
tumbler
within
the
lower
drawer
and
flicking
a
stogy
ash
from
his
waistcoat
the
honorable
justice
who
handed
it
to
us
is
no
friend
of
ours
he
is
assented
his
partner
it
was
babson
and
he
hates
italians
moreover
he
stated
in
open
court
that
he
proposed
to
try
the
case
himself
next
monday
and
that
we
must
be
ready
without
fail
so
babson
did
that
to
us
growled
tutt
just
like
him
he
pack
the
jury
and
charge
our
innocent
angelo
into
the
middle
of
hades
and
is
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
charge
of
the
prosecution
mildly
added
tutt
but
what
can
we
do
we
assigned
we
got
a
guilty
client
and
we
got
to
defend
him
have
you
set
bonnie
doon
looking
up
witnesses
asked
tutt
i
thought
i
saw
him
outside
during
the
forenoon
yes
replied
tutt
but
bonnie
says
it
the
toughest
case
he
ever
had
to
handle
in
which
to
find
any
witnesses
for
the
defense
there
any
besides
the
girl
bought
the
gun
and
gave
it
to
angelo
the
same
day
how
do
you
know
that
demanded
tutt
frowning
because
she
told
me
so
herself
said
tutt
she
outside
if
you
want
to
see
her
i
might
as
well
give
her
what
you
call
once
over
replied
the
senior
partner
tutt
retired
and
presently
returned
half
leading
half
pushing
a
shrinking
young
italian
woman
shabbily
dressed
but
with
the
features
of
one
of
raphael
madonnas
she
wore
no
hat
and
her
hands
and
finger
nails
were
far
from
clean
but
from
the
folds
of
her
black
shawl
her
neck
rose
like
a
column
of
slightly
discolored
carrara
marble
upon
which
her
head
with
its
coils
of
heavy
hair
was
poised
with
the
grace
of
a
sulky
empress
come
in
my
child
and
sit
down
said
tutt
kindly
no
not
in
that
one
in
that
one
he
indicated
the
chair
previously
occupied
by
his
junior
you
can
leave
us
tutt
i
want
to
talk
to
this
young
lady
alone
the
girl
sat
sullenly
with
averted
face
showing
in
her
attitude
her
instinctive
feeling
that
all
officers
of
the
law
no
matter
upon
which
side
they
were
supposed
to
be
were
one
and
all
engaged
in
a
mysterious
conspiracy
of
which
she
and
her
unfortunate
angelo
were
the
victims
a
few
words
from
the
old
lawyer
and
she
began
to
feel
more
confidence
however
no
one
in
fact
could
help
but
realize
at
first
glance
tutt
warmth
of
heart
the
lines
of
his
sunken
cheeks
if
left
to
themselves
automatically
tended
to
draw
together
into
a
whimsical
smile
and
it
required
a
positive
act
of
will
upon
his
part
to
adopt
the
stern
and
relentless
look
with
which
he
was
wont
to
glower
down
upon
some
unfortunate
witness
in
inside
tutt
was
a
benign
and
rather
mellow
old
fellow
with
a
dry
sense
of
humor
and
a
very
keen
knowledge
of
his
fellow
men
he
made
a
good
deal
of
money
but
not
having
any
wife
or
child
upon
which
to
lavish
it
he
spent
it
all
either
on
books
or
surreptitiously
in
quixotic
gifts
to
friends
or
strangers
whom
he
either
secretly
admired
or
whom
he
believed
to
be
in
need
of
money
there
were
vague
traditions
in
the
office
of
presents
of
bizarre
and
quite
impossible
clothes
made
to
office
boys
and
stenographers
of
reoutfitted
and
sent
rejoicing
to
foreign
parts
of
tramps
gorged
to
repletion
and
then
pumped
dry
of
their
adventures
in
tutt
comfortable
dingy
old
library
of
a
fur
coat
suddenly
clapped
upon
the
rounded
shoulders
of
old
scraggs
the
antiquated
scrivener
in
the
accountant
cage
in
the
outer
office
whose
alcoholic
career
his
employer
alleged
was
marked
by
a
trail
of
empty
rum
kegs
each
one
flying
the
white
flag
of
surrender
and

old
ephraim
tutt
could
on
occasion
be
cold
as
chiseled
steel
and
as
hard
any
appeal
from
a
child
a
woman
or
an
outcast
always
met
with
his
ready
response
but
for
the
rich
successful
and
those
in
power
he
seemed
to
entertain
a
deep
and
enduring
grudge
he
would
burn
the
midnight
oil
with
equal
zest
to
block
a
crooked
deal
on
the
part
of
a
wealthy
corporation
or
to
devise
a
means
to
extricate
some
no
less
crooked
rascal
from
the
clutches
of
the
law
provided
that
the
rascal
seemed
the
victim
of
hard
luck
inheritance
or
environment
his
conscience
was
as
elastic
as
his
heart
indeed
when
under
the
expansive
influence
of
a
sufficient
quantity
of
malt
extract
or
ancient
brandy
from
the
cellaret
on
his
library
desk
he
had
sometimes
been
heard
to
enunciate
the
theory
that
there
was
very
little
difference
between
the
people
in
jail
and
those
who
were
not
he
would
work
weeks
without
compensation
to
argue
the
case
of
some
guilty
rogue
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
as
he
said
to
settle
the
law
when
his
only
real
object
was
to
get
the
miserable
fellow
out
of
jail
and
send
him
back
to
his
wife
and
children
he
went
through
life
with
a
twinkling
eye
and
a
quizzical
smile
and
when
he
did
wrong
he
did
it
if
such
a
thing
is
possible
in
a
way
to
make
people
better
he
was
a
dangerous
adversary
and
judges
were
afraid
of
him
not
because
he
ever
tricked
or
deceived
them
but
because
of
the
audacity
and
novelty
of
his
arguments
which
left
them
speechless
he
had
the
assurance
that
usually
comes
with
age
and
with
a
lifelong
knowledge
of
human
nature
yet
apparently
he
had
always
been
possessed
of
it
once
a
judge
having
assigned
him
to
look
out
for
the
interests
of
a
lawyerless
prisoner
suggested
that
he
take
his
new
client
into
the
adjoining
jury
room
and
give
him
the
best
advice
he
could
tutt
was
gone
so
long
that
the
judge
became
weary
and
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
him
sent
an
officer
who
found
the
lawyer
reading
a
newspaper
beside
an
open
window
but
no
sign
of
the
prisoner
in
great
excitement
the
officer
reported
the
situation
to
the
judge
who
ordered
tutt
to
the
bar
what
has
become
of
the
prisoner
demanded
his
honor
i
do
not
know
replied
the
lawyer
calmly
the
window
was
open
and
i
suspect
that
he
used
it
as
a
means
of
exit
are
you
not
aware
that
you
are
a
party
to
an
escape
a
crime
hotly
challenged
the
judge
i
most
respectfully
deny
the
charge
returned
tutt
i
told
you
to
take
the
prisoner
into
that
room
and
give
him
the
best
advice
you
could
i
did
interjected
the
lawyer
ah
exclaimed
the
judge
you
admit
it
what
advice
did
you
give
him
the
law
does
not
permit
me
to
state
that
answered
tutt
in
his
most
dignified
tones
that
is
a
privileged
communication
from
the
inviolate
obligation
to
preserve
which
only
my
client
can
release
me
i
can
not
betray
a
sacred
trust
yet
i
might
quote
cervantes
and
remind
your
honor
that
leaves
always
some
door
open
to
come
at
a
remedy
now
as
he
gazed
at
the
cheeks
of
the
whose
husband
had
committed
murder
in
defense
of
her
he
vowed
that
so
far
as
he
was
able
he
would
fight
to
save
him
the
more
desperate
the
case
the
more
desperate
her
need
of
him
the
greater
the
duty
and
the
greater
his
honor
if
successful
believe
that
i
am
your
friend
my
dear
he
assured
her
you
and
i
must
work
together
to
set
angelo
free
it
no
use
she
returned
less
defiantly
he
done
it
he
wo
deny
it
but
he
is
entitled
to
his
defense
urged
tutt
quietly
he
wo
make
no
defense
we
must
make
one
for
him
there
ai
none
he
just
went
and
killed
him
tutt
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
is
always
a
defense
he
answered
with
conviction
anyhow
we
ca
let
him
be
convicted
without
making
an
effort
will
they
be
able
to
prove
where
he
got
the
pistol
he
did
get
the
pistol
retorted
the
girl
with
a
glint
in
her
black
eyes
i
got
it
i
ha
shot
him
myself
if
he
had
i
said
i
was
goin
to
but
he
would
let
me
dear
dear
sighed
tutt
what
a
case
both
of
you
trying
to
see
which
could
get
hanged
first
the
inevitable
day
of
angelo
trial
came
upon
the
bench
the
honorable
justice
babson
glowered
down
upon
the
cowering
defendant
flanked
by
his
distinguished
counsel
tutt
tutt
and
upon
the
two
hundred
good
and
true
talesmen
who
all
other
business
laid
aside
had
been
dragged
from
the
comfort
of
their
homes
and
the
important
affairs
of
their
various
livelihoods
to
pass
upon
the
merits
of
the
issue
duly
joined
between
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
angelo
serafino
charged
with
murder
one
by
one
as
his
name
was
called
each
took
his
seat
in
the
witness
chair
upon
the
and
perjured
himself
like
a
gentleman
in
order
to
escape
from
service
shyly
confessing
to
an
ineradicable
prejudice
against
the
entire
italian
race
and
this
defendant
in
particular
and
to
an
antipathy
against
capital
punishment
which
so
each
unhesitatingly
averred
would
render
him
utterly
incapable
of
satisfactorily
performing
his
functions
if
selected
as
a
juryman
hardly
one
however
but
was
routed
by
the
machiavellian
babson
hardly
one
however
ingenious
his
excuse
whether
about
to
be
married
or
immediately
become
a
father
whether
engaged
in
a
business
deal
involving
millions
which
required
his
instant
and
personal
attention
whether
in
the
last
stages
of
illness
or
obligated
to
be
present
at
the
bedside
of
a
dying
wife
but
was
browbeaten
into
helplessness
and
ordered
back
to
take
his
place
amidst
the
waiting
throng
of
recalcitrant
citizens
so
disinclined
to
do
their
part
in
elevating
that
system
of
trial
by
jury
the
failure
of
which
at
other
times
they
so
loudly
condemned
this
trifling
preliminary
having
been
concluded
the
few
jurymen
who
had
managed
to
wriggle
through
the
judicial
sieve
were
allowed
to
withdraw
the
balance
of
the
calendar
was
adjourned
those
spectators
who
were
standing
up
were
ordered
to
sit
down
and
those
already
sitting
down
were
ordered
to
sit
somewhere
else
the
prisoners
in
the
rear
of
the
room
were
sent
back
to
the
tombs
to
await
their
fate
upon
some
later
day
the
reporters
gathered
rapaciously
about
the
table
just
behind
the
defendant
a
corpulent
ganymede
in
the
person
of
an
aged
court
officer
bore
tremblingly
an
opaque
glass
of
yellow
drinking
water
to
the
bench
the
prosecutor
blew
his
nose
with
a
fanfare
of
trumpets
tutt
smiled
an
ingratiating
smile
which
seemed
to
clasp
the
whole
world
to
his
bosom
and
the
real
battle
commenced
a
game
in
which
every
card
in
the
pack
had
been
stacked
against
the
prisoner
by
an
unscrupulous
pair
of
officials
whose
only
aim
was
to
maintain
their
record
of
convictions
of
murder
in
the
first
and
who
laid
their
plans
with
ingenuity
and
carried
them
out
with
skill
and
enthusiasm
to
habitual
success
they
were
a
grand
little
pair
of
convictors
were
babson
and
and
woe
unto
that
man
who
was
brought
before
them
it
was
even
alleged
by
the
impious
that
when
babson
was
in
doubt
what
to
do
or
what
wanted
him
to
do
the
latter
communicated
the
information
to
his
conspirator
upon
the
bench
by
a
system
of
preconcerted
signals
but
indeed
no
such
system
was
necessary
for
the
judge
part
in
the
drama
was
merely
to
sustain
his
colleague
objections
and
overrule
those
of
his
opponent
after
which
he
himself
delivered
the
de
with
unerring
insight
and
accuracy
when
babson
got
through
charging
a
jury
the
latter
had
always
in
fact
been
instructed
in
brutal
and
sneering
tones
to
convict
the
defendant
or
forever
after
to
regard
themselves
as
disloyal
citizens
oath
violators
and
outcasts
though
the
stenographic
record
of
his
remarks
would
have
led
the
reader
thereof
to
suppose
that
this
same
judge
was
a
conscientious
merciful
lover
of
humanity
whose
sensitive
soul
quivered
at
the
mere
thought
of
a
prison
cell
and
who
meticulously
sought
to
surround
the
defendant
with
every
protection
the
law
could
interpose
against
the
imputation
of
guilt
he
was
as
tutt
put
it
a
dangerous
old
cuss
was
even
worse
he
was
a
pugnosed
young
ruffian
with
beery
eyes
who
had
an
insatiable
ambition
and
a
still
greater
conceit
but
who
had
devised
a
blundering
innocent
helpless
way
of
conducting
himself
before
a
jury
that
deceived
them
into
believing
that
his
inexperience
required
their
help
and
his
disinterestedness
their
loyal
support
both
of
them
were
apparently
honest
public
servants
both
in
reality
were
subtly
disingenuous
to
a
degree
beyond
ordinary
comprehension
for
years
of
practise
had
made
them
sensitive
to
every
whimsy
of
emotion
and
taught
them
how
to
play
upon
the
psychology
of
the
jury
as
the
careless
zephyr
softly
draws
its
melody
from
the
aeolian
harp
in
a
word
they
were
a
precious
pair
of
crooks
who
for
their
own
petty
selfish
ends
played
fast
and
loose
with
liberty
life
and
death
both
of
them
hated
tutt
who
had
more
than
once
made
them
ridiculous
before
the
jury
and
shown
them
up
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
old
lawyer
recognized
well
the
fact
that
these
two
legal
wolves
were
in
revenge
planning
to
tear
him
and
his
helpless
client
to
pieces
having
first
deliberately
selected
him
as
a
victim
and
assigned
him
to
officiate
at
a
ceremony
which
however
just
so
far
as
its
consummation
might
be
concerned
was
nothing
less
in
its
conduct
than
judicial
murder
now
they
were
laughing
at
him
in
their
sleeves
for
tutt
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
never
having
defended
a
client
who
had
been
convicted
of
murder
and
that
spotless
reputation
was
about
to
be
annihilated
forever
though
the
defense
had
thirty
peremptory
challenges
tutt
well
knew
that
babson
would
sustain
the
prosecutor
objections
for
bias
until
the
jury
box
would
contain
the
twelve
automata
personally
selected
by
in
advance
from
what
tutt
called
the
army
of
the
gibbet
yet
the
old
war
horse
outwardly
maintained
a
calm
and
genial
exterior
betraying
none
of
the
apprehension
which
in
fact
existed
beneath
his
mask
of
professional
composure
the
court
officer
rapped
sharply
for
silence
are
you
quite
ready
to
proceed
with
the
case
inquired
the
judge
with
a
courtesy
in
which
was
ill
concealed
a
leer
of
triumph
yes
your
honor
responded
tutt
in
velvet
tones
call
the
first
talesman
the
fight
was
on
the
professional
duel
between
traditional
enemies
in
which
the
stake
a
human
life
was
in
truth
the
thing
of
least
concern
had
begun
yet
no
casual
observer
would
have
suspected
the
actual
significance
of
what
was
going
on
or
the
part
that
envy
malice
uncharitableness
greed
selfishness
and
ambition
were
playing
in
it
he
would
have
seen
merely
a
partially
filled
courtroom
flooded
with
sunshine
from
high
windows
an
attentive
and
dignified
judge
in
a
black
silk
robe
sitting
upon
a
dais
below
which
a
clerk
drew
little
slips
of
paper
from
a
wheel
and
summoned
jurymen
to
a
service
which
outwardly
bore
no
suggestion
of
a
tragedy
he
would
have
seen
a
somewhat
unprepossessing
assistant
district
attorney
lounging
in
front
of
the
jury
box
taking
apparently
no
great
interest
in
the
proceedings
and
a
young
italian
sitting
at
the
prisoner
table
between
a
rubicund
little
man
with
a
round
red
face
and
a
tall
grave
lawyer
with
a
frame
not
unlike
that
of
abraham
lincoln
over
whose
wrinkled
face
played
from
time
to
time
the
suggestion
of
a
smile
behind
a
balustrade
were
the
reporters
scribbling
on
rough
sheets
of
yellow
paper
then
came
rows
of
benches
upon
the
first
of
which
as
near
the
jury
box
as
possible
sat
rosalina

loafers
and

seeking
emotional
sensations
which
they
had
not
the

the
courtroom
was
comparatively
quiet
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
droning
voice
of
the
clerk
and
the
lazy
interplay
of
question
and
answer
between
talesman
and
lawyer
yet
beneath
the
humdrum
casual
almost
indifferent
manner
in
which
the
proceedings
seemed
to
be

helpless
ten
minutes
and
the
clerk
called
the
roll
beginning
with
walsh
and
they
were
solemnly
sworn
a
true
verdict
to
find
and
settled
themselves
to
the
task
the
mills
of
the
gods
had
begun
to
grind
and
angelo
was
being
dragged
to
his
fate
as
inexorably
and
as
surely
with
about
as
much
chance
of
escape
as
a
log
that
is
being
drawn
slowly
toward
a
buzz
saw
you
may
open
the
case
announced
judge
babson
leaning
back
and
wiping
his
glasses
then
surreptitiously
he
began
to
read
his
mail
as
his
fellow
conspirator
undertook
to
tell
the
jury
what
it
was
all
about
one
by
one
the
witnesses
were
called
the
coroner
physician
the
policeman
who
had
arrested
angelo
outside
the
barber
shop
with
the
smoking
pistol
in
his
hand
the
assistant
barber
who
had
seen
the
shooting
the
customer
who
was
being
shaved
each
drove
a
spike
into
poor
angelo
legal
coffin
tutt
could
not
shake
them
this
evidence
was
plain
he
had
come
into
the
shop
accused
crocedoro
of
making
his
wife
life
unbearable
and
shot
him
yet
tutt
did
not
lose
any
of
his
equanimity
with
the
tips
of
his
long
fingers
held
lightly
together
in
front
of
him
and
swaying
slightly
backward
and
forward
upon
the
balls
of
his
feet
he
smiled
benignly
down
upon
the
customer
and
the
barber
assistant
as
if
these
witnesses
were
merely
unfortunate
in
not
being
able
to
disclose
to
the
jury
all
the
facts
his
manner
indicated
that
a
mysterious
and
untold
tragedy
lay
behind
what
they
had
heard
a
tragedy
pregnant
with
primordial
vital
passions
involving
the
most
sacred
of
human
relationships
which
when
known
would
rouse
the
spirit
of
chivalry
of
the
entire
panel
on
the
barber
testified
that
angelo
had
said
you
maka
small
of
my
wife
long
enough
ah
murmured
tutt
waving
an
arm
in
the
direction
of
rosalina
did
the
witness
recognize
the
defendant
young
wife
the
jury
showed
interest
and
examined
the
sobbing
rosalina
with
approval
yes
the
witness
recognized
her
did
the
witness
know
to
what
incident
or
incidents
the
defendant
had
referred
by
his
remark
what
the
deceased
crocedoro
had
done
to
rosalina
if
anything
no
the
witness
did
not
tutt
looked
significantly
at
the
row
of
faces
in
the
jury
box
then
leaning
forward
he
asked
significantly
did
you
see
crocedoro
threaten
the
defendant
with
his
razor
i
object
shouted
springing
to
his
feet
the
question
is
improper
there
is
no
suggestion
that
crocedoro
did
anything
the
defendant
can
testify
to
that
if
he
wants
to
oh
let
him
answer
drawled
the
judge
no
began
the
witness
ah
cried
tutt
you
did
not
see
crocedoro
threaten
the
defendant
with
his
razor
that
will
do
but
forewarned
by
this
trifling
experience
induced
the
customer
the
next
witness
to
swear
that
crocedoro
had
not
in
fact
made
any
move
whatever
with
his
razor
toward
angelo
who
had
deliberately
raised
his
pistol
and
shot
him
tutt
rose
to
the
with
the
same
urbanity
as
before
where
was
the
witness
standing
the
witness
said
he
was
standing
well
where
was
he
sitting
then
in
the
chair
ah
exclaimed
tutt
triumphantly
then
you
had
your
back
to
the
shooting
in
a
moment
had
the
witness
practically
rescued
by
the
explanation
that
he
had
seen
the
whole
thing
in
the
glass
in
front
of
him
the
firm
of
tutt
tutt
uttered
in
chorus
a
groan
of
outraged
incredulity
several
jurymen
were
seen
to
wrinkle
their
foreheads
in
meditation
tutt
had
sown
a
tiny
infinitesimally
tiny
to
be
sure
seed
of
doubt
not
as
to
the
killing
at
all
but
as
to
the
complete
veracity
of
the
witness
and
then
made
his
coup
rosalina
serafino
take
the
witness
stand
he
ordered
he
would
get
from
her
own
lips
the
admission
that
she
bought
the
pistol
and
gave
it
to
angelo
but
with
an
outburst
of
indignation
that
would
have
done
credit
to
the
elder
booth
tutt
was
immediately
on
his
feet
protesting
against
the
outrage
the
barbarity
the
heartlessness
the
illegality
of
making
a
wife
testify
against
her
husband
his
eyes
flashed
his
disordered
locks
waved
in
picturesque
synchronization
with
his
impassioned
gestures
rosalina
her
beautiful
golden
cross
rising
and
falling
hysterically
upon
her
bosom
took
her
seat
in
the
witness
chair
like
a
frightened
furtive
creature
of
the
woods
gazed
for
one
brief
instant
upon
the
twelve
men
in
the
jury
box
with
those
great
black
eyes
of
hers
and
then
with
burning
cheeks
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
i
protest
against
this
piece
of
cruelty
cried
tutt
in
a
voice
vibrating
with
indignation
this
is
worthy
of
the
inquisition
will
not
even
the
cross
upon
her
breast
protect
her
from
being
compelled
to
reveal
those
secrets
that
are
sacred
to
wife
and
motherhood
can
the
law
thus
indirectly
tear
the
seal
of
confidence
from
the
confessional
you
go
too
far
there
are
some
things
that
even
you
brilliant
as
you
are
may
not
trifle
with
a
juryman
nodded
the
eleven
others
being
more
intelligent
failed
to
understand
what
he
was
talking
about
tutt
objection
is
sound
if
he
wishes
to
press
it
remarked
the
judge
satirically
you
may
step
down

the

not
compel
a

inquired
babson
bowed
and
the
jury
saw
the
lawyer
lean
across
the
defendant
and
engage
his
partner
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
weighty
deliberation
i

as

him

with
great
dignity
tutt
then
rose
and
again
addressed
the
court
we

extraordinary

began
angelo
breaking
loose
from

and
struggling
to
his
feet
it
was
a
horrible
movement
but
tutt
clapped
his
hand
over
angelo
mouth
and
forced
him
back
into
his
seat

babson
how

tutt
looked
at
the
clock
which
pointed
to

the
regular
hour
of
adjournment
was
at

delay
was
everything
in
a
case
like
this
a
juryman
might
die
suddenly
overnight
or
fall
grievously
ill
or
some
legal
accident
might
occur
which
would
necessitate
declaring
a
mistrial
there
is
always
hope
in
a
criminal
case
so
long
as
the
verdict
has
not
actually
been
returned
and
the
jury
polled
and
discharged
if
possible
he
must
drag
his
summing
up
over
until
the
following
day
something
might
happen
about
two
hours
your
honor
he
replied
the
jury
stirred
impatiently
it
was
clear
that
they
regarded
a
speech
from
him
under
the
circumstances
as
an
imposition
but
babson
wished
to
preserve
the
fiction
of
impartiality
very
well
said
he
you

sum

an

everybody

no

with

bellowed
captain
phelan
tutt
with
an
ominous
heightening
of
the
pulse
realized
that
the
real
ordeal
was
at
last
at
hand
for
the
closing
of
the
case
had
wrought
in
the
old
lawyer
an
instant
metamorphosis
with
the
words
the
defense
rests
every
suggestion
of
the
mountebank
the
actor
or
the
shyster
had
vanished
the
awful
responsibility
under
which
he
labored
the
overwhelming
and
damning
evidence
against
his
client
the
terrible
consequences
of
the
least
mistake
that
he
might
make
the
fact
that
only
the
sword
of
his
ability
and
his
alone
stood
between
angelo
and
a
hideous
death
by
fire
in
the
electric
chair
sobered
and
chastened
him
had
he
been
a
praying
man
in
that
moment
he
would
have
prayed
but
he
was
not
for
his
client
was
foredoomed
foredoomed
not
only
by
justice
but
also
by
trickery
and
guile
and
was
being
driven
slowly
but
surely
towards
the
judicial
shambles
for
what
had
he
succeeded
in
adducing
in
his
behalf
nothing
but
the
purely
apocryphal
speculation
that
the
dead
barber
might
have
threatened
angelo
with
his
razor
and
that
the
witnesses
might
possibly
have
drawn
somewhat
upon
their
imaginations
in
giving
the
details
of
their
testimony
a
sorry
defense
indeed
no
defense
at
all
all
the
sorrier
in
that
he
had
not
even
been
able
to
get
before
the
jury
the
purely
sentimental
excuses
for
the
homicide
for
he
could
only
do
this
by
calling
rosalina
to
the
stand
which
would
have
enabled
the
prosecution
to
her
in
regard
to
the
purchase
of
the
pistol
and
the
delivery
of
it
to
her
husband
the
strongest
evidence
of
premeditation
yet
he
must
find
some
argument
some
plea
some
thread
of
reason
upon
which
the
jury
might
hang
a
disagreement
or
a
verdict
in
a
lesser
degree
with
a
shuffling
of
feet
the
last
of
the
crowd
pushed
through
the
big
oak
doors
and
they
were
closed
and
locked
an
officer
brought
a
corroded
tumbler
of
brackish
water
and
placed
it
in
front
of
tutt
the
judge
leaned
forward
with
malicious
courtesy
the
jury
settled
themselves
and
turned
toward
the
lawyer
attentively
yet
defiantly
hardening
their
hearts
already
against
his
expected
appeals
to
sentiment
ostentatiously
producing
a
cigarette
lounged
out
through
the
side
door
leading
to
the
jury
room
and
prison
cells
the
clerk
began
copying
his
records
the
clock
ticked
loudly
and
tutt
rose
and
began
going
through
the
empty
formality
of
attempting
to
discuss
the
evidence
in
such
a
way
as
to
excuse
or
palliate
angelo
crime
for
angelo
guilt
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
was
so
plain
that
it
had
never
for
one
moment
been
in
the
slightest
doubt
whatever
might
be
said
for
his
act
from
the
point
of
view
of
human
emotion
only
made
his
motive
and
responsibility
under
the
statues
all
the
clearer
there
was
not
even
the
unwritten
law
to
appeal
to
yet
there
was
fundamentally
a
genuine
defense
a
defense
that
could
not
be
urged
even
by
innuendo
the
defense
that
no
accused
ought
to
be
convicted
upon
any
evidence
whatever
no
matter
how
conclusive
in
a
trial
conducted
with
essential
though
wholly
concealed
unfairness
such
was
the
case
of
angelo
no
one
could
demonstrate
it
no
one
could
with
safety
even
hint
at
it
any
charge
that
the
court
was
anything
but
impartial
would
prove
a
boomerang
to
the
defense
and
yet
the
facts
remained
that
the
whole
proceeding
from
start
to
finish
had
been
conducted
unfairly
and
with
illegality
that
the
jury
had
been
duped
and
deceived
and
that
the
pretense
that
the
guilty
angelo
had
been
given
an
impartial
trial
was
a
farce
every
word
of
the
court
had
been
an
accusation
a
sneer
an
acceptance
of
the
defendant
guilt
as
a
matter
of
course
an
abuse
far
more
subversive
of
our
theory
of
government
than
the
mere
acquittal
of
a
single
criminal
for
it
struck
at
the
very
foundations
of
that
liberty
which
the
fathers
had
sought
the
shores
of
the
unknown
continent
to
gain
unmistakably
the
proceedings
had
been
conducted
throughout
upon
the
theory
that
the
defendant
must
prove
his
innocence
and
that
presumably
he
was
a
guilty
man
and
this
as
well
as
his
own
impression
that
the
evidence
was
conclusive
the
judge
had
subtly
conveyed
to
the
jury
in
his
tone
of
speaking
his
ironical
manner
and
his
facial
expression
guilty
or
not
angelo
was
being
railroaded
that
was
the
real
defense
the
defense
that
could
never
be
established
even
in
any
higher
court
except
perhaps
in
the
highest
court
of
all
which
is
not
of
earth
and
so
tutt
boiling
with
suppressed
indignation
weighed
down
with
the
sense
of
his
responsibility
fully
realizing
his
inability
to
say
anything
based
on
the
evidence
in
behalf
of
his
client
feeling
twenty
years
older
than
he
had
during
the
verbal
duel
of
the
actual
rose
with
a
genial
smile
upon
his
puckered
old
face
and
with
a
careless
air
almost
of
gaiety
which
seemed
to
indicate
the
utmost
confidence
and
determination
and
with
a
graceful
compliment
to
his
arch
enemy
upon
the
bench
and
the
yellow
dog
who
had
hunted
with
him
assured
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
had
the
fairest
of
fair
trials
and
that
he
tutt
would
now
proceed
to
demonstrate
to
their
satisfaction
his
client
entire
innocence
nay
would
show
them
that
he
was
a
man
not
only
guiltless
of
any
but
worthy
of
their
hearty
commendation
with
jokes
not
too
unseemly
for
the
occasion
he
overcame
their
preliminary
distrust
and
put
them
in
a
good
humor
he
gave
a
historical
dissertation
upon
the
law
governing
homicide
on
the
constitutional
rights
of
american
citizens
on
the
laws
of
naturalization
marriage
and
the
domestic
relations
waxed
eloquent
over
italy
and
the
italian
character
mentioned
cavour
garibaldi
and
mazzini
in
a
way
to
imply
that
angelo
was
their
lineal
descendant

nothing

bunk
muttered

studying
the
twelve

they
all

nothing

not
interesting
these
prosaic
citizens
of
new
york
county
these
saloon
and
hotel
keepers
these
contractors
insurance
agents
and
salesmen
were
learning
something
of
history
of
philosophy
of
art
and
beauty
they
liked
it
they
felt
they
were
hearing
something
worth
while
as
indeed
they
were
and
they
forgot
all
about
angelo
and
the
unfortunate
crocedoro
in
their
admiration
for
tutt
who
had
lifted
them
out
of
the
dingy
sordid
courtroom
into
the
sunlight
of
the
golden
age
and
as
he
led
them
through
greek
and
roman
literature
through
the
early
english
poets
through
shakespeare
and
the
king
james
version
down
to
john
galsworthy
and
rupert
brooke
he
brought
something
that
was
noble
fine
and
sweet
into
their
grubby
materialistic
lives
and
at
the

time
the

of
the

on
my
mistah
tutt
upstairs
in
his
library
tutt
strode
up
and
down
before
the
empty
grate
smoking
stogy
after
stogy
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
devise
something
to
say
upon
the
morrow
but
all
his
ideas
had
flown
there
was
anything
to
say
yet
he
swore
angelo
should
not
be
offered
up
as
a
victim
upon
the
altar
of
unscrupulous
ambition
the
hours
passed
and
the
old
banjo
clock
above
the
mantel
wheezed
eleven
twelve
then
one
two
still
he
paced
up
and
down
up
and
down
in
a
sort
of
trance
the
air
of
the
library
blue
with
the
smoke
of
countless
stogies
stifled
and
suffocated
him
moreover
he
discovered
that
he
was
hungry
he
descended
to
the
pantry
and
salvaged
a
piece
of
pie
then
unchained
the
front
door
and
stepped
forth
into
the
soft
october
night
a
full
moon
hung
over
the
deserted
streets
of
the
sleeping
city
in
divers
places
widely
scattered
the
twelve
good
and
true
men
were
snoring
snugly
in
bed
they
would
send
angelo
to
his
death
without
a
quiver
he
shuddered
striding
on
he
knew
not
whither
into
the
night
his
brain
no
longer
worked
he
had
become
a
peripatetic
automaton
to
nocturnal
perambulation
with
his
pockets
bulging
with
stogies
and
one
glowing
like
a
headlight
in
advance
of
him
he
wandered
in
a
sort
of
coma
up
tenth
avenue
crossed
to
the
riverside
drive
mounted
morningside
heights
descended
again
through
the
rustling
alleys
of
central
park
and
found
himself
at
fifth
avenue
and
street
just
as
the
dawn
was
paling
the
electric
lamps
to
a
sickly
yellow
and
the
trees
were
casting
strange
unwonted
shadows
in
the
wrong
direction
he
was
utterly
exhausted
he
looked
eagerly
for
some
place
to
sit
down
but
the
doors
of
the
hotels
were
dark
and
tightly
closed
and
it
was
too
cold
to
remain
without
moving
in
the
open
air
down
fifth
avenue
he
trudged
intending
to
go
home
and
snatch
a
few
hours
sleep
before
court
should
open
but
each
block
seemed
miles
in
length
presently
he
approached
the
cathedral
whose
twin
spires
were
tinted
with
reddish
gold
the
sky
had
become
a
bright
blue
suddenly
all
the
street
lamps
went
out
he
told
himself
that
he
had
never
realized
before
the
beauty
of
those
two
towers
reaching
up
toward
eternity
typifying
man
aspiration
for
the
spiritual
he
remembered
having
heard
that
a
cathedral
was
never
closed
and
looking
toward
the
door
he
perceived
that
it
was
open
with
utmost
difficulty
he
climbed
the
steps
and
entered
its
dark
shadows
a
faint
light
emanated
from
the
tops
of
the
windows
down
below
a
candle
burned
on
either
side
of
the
altar
while
a
flickering
gleam
shone
from
the
red
cup
in
the
sanctuary
lamp
worn
out
drugged
for
lack
of
sleep
faint
for
want
of
food
old
tutt
sank
down
upon
one
of
the
rear
seats
by
the
door
and
resting
his
head
upon
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
bench
in
front
of
him
fell
fast
asleep
he
dreamed
of
a
legal
heaven
of
a
great
wooden
throne
upon
which
sat
babson
in
a
black
robe
and
below
him
twelve
angels
in
a
double
row
with
harps
in
their
hands
chanting
guilty
guilty
guilty
an
organ
was
playing
somewhere
and
there
was
a
great
noise
of
footsteps
then
a
bell
twinkled
and
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
that
the
chancel
was
full
of
lights
and
priests
it
was
broad
daylight
horrified
he
looked
at
his
watch
to
find
that
it
was
ten
minutes
after
ten
his
joints
creaked
as
he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
his
eyes
were
half
closed
as
he
staggered
down
the
steps
and
hailed
a
taxi
criminal
courts
building
side
door
and
drive
like
hell
he
muttered
to
the
driver
he
reached
it
just
as
judge
babson
and
his
attendant
were
coming
into
the
courtroom
and
the
crowd
were
making
obeisance
everybody
else
was
in
his
proper
place
you
may
proceed
tutt
said
the
judge
after
the
roll
of
the
jury
had
been
called
but
tutt
was
in
a
daze
in
no
condition
to
think
or
speak
there
was
a
curious
rustling
in
his
ears
and
his
sight
was
somewhat
blurred
the
atmosphere
of
the
courtroom
seemed
to
him
cold
and
hostile
the
jury
sat
with
averted
faces
he
rose
feebly
and
cleared
his
throat
gentlemen
of
the
jury
he
began
i
i
think
i
covered
everything
i
had
to
say
yesterday
afternoon
i
can
only
beseech
you
to
realize
the
full
extent
of
your
great
responsibility
and
remind
you
that
if
you
entertain
a
reasonable
doubt
upon
the
evidence
you
are
sworn
to
give
the
benefit
of
it
to
the
defendant
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
while
a
murmur
ran
along
the
benches
of
the
courtroom
the
old
man
had
collapsed
tough
luck
the
defendant
was
cooked
swiftly
leaped
to
his
feet
there
had
been
no
defense
the
case
was
as
plain
as
a
there
was
only
one
thing
for
the
jury
to
do
return
a
verdict
of
murder
in
the
first
it
would
not
be
pleasant
but
that
made
no
difference
he
read
them
the
statute
applied
it
to
the
facts
and
shook
his
fist
in
their
faces
they
must
convict
and
convict
of
only
one
thing
and
nothing
else
murder
in
the
first
degree
they
gazed
at
him
like
silly
sheep
nodding
their
heads
doing
everything
but
bleat
then
babson
cleared
his
decks
and
rising
in
dignity
expounded
the
law
to
the
sheep
in
a
rich
mellow
voice
in
which
he
impressed
upon
them
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
jury
system
and
the
sanctity
of
human
life
he
pronounced
an
obituary
of
great
beauty
upon
the
deceased
barber
who
could
not
as
he
pointed
out
speak
for
himself
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
his
grave
he
venomously
excoriated
the
defendant
who
had
deliberately
planned
to
kill
an
unarmed
man
peacefully
conducting
himself
in
his
place
of
business
and
expressed
the
utmost
confidence
that
he
could
rely
upon
the
jury
whose
character
he
well
knew
to
perform
their
full
duty
no
matter
how
disagreeable
that
duty
might
be
the
sheep
nodded
you
may
retire
gentlemen
babson
looked
down
at
tutt
with
a
significant
gleam
in
his
eye
he
had
driven
in
the
knife
to
the
hilt
and
twisted
it
round
and
round
angelo
had
almost
as
much
chance
as
the
proverbial
celluloid
cat
tutt
felt
actually
sick
he
did
not
look
at
the
jury
as
they
went
out
they
would
not
be
long
and
he
could
hardly
face
the
thought
of
their
return
never
in
his
long
experience
had
he
found
himself
in
such
a
desperate
situation
heretofore
there
had
always
been
some
argument
some
construction
of
the
facts
upon
which
he
could
make
an
appeal
however
fallacious
or
illogical
he
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
the
judge
was
chatting
with
the
court
officers
were
betting
with
the
reporters
as
to
the
length
of
time
in
which
it
would
take
the
twelve
to
agree
upon
a
verdict
of
murder
in
the
first
the
funeral
rites
were
all
concluded
except
for
the
final
commitment
of
the
corpse
to
mother
earth
and
then
without
warning
angelo
suddenly
rose
and
addressed
the
court
in
a
defiant
shriek
i
killa
that
man
he
cried
wildly
he
maka
small
of
my
wife
he
no

he
bad
egg
i
killa

killa

exclaimed
babson
with
biting
sarcasm
you

to
make
a
confession
you
hope
for
mercy
do
you
well
tutt
what
do
you
wish
to
do

tutt
rose
trembling
to
his
feet
the
case
is
closed
your
honor
he
replied
i
will
consent
to
a
mistrial
and
offer
a
plea
of
guilty
of
manslaughter
i
can
not
agree
to
reopen
the
case
i
can
not
let
the
defendant
go
upon
the
stand
the
spectators
and
reporters
were
pressing
forward
to
the
bar
anxious
lest
they
should
lose
a
single
word
of
the
colloquy
angelo
remained
standing
looking
eagerly
at
who
returned
his
gaze
with
a
grin
like
that
of
a
hyena
i
killa
him
angelo
repeated
you
killa
me
if
you
want
sit
down
thundered
the
judge
enough
of
this
the
law
does
not
permit
me
to
accept
a
plea
to
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
my
conscience
and
my
sense
of
duty
to
the
public
will
permit
me
to
accept
no
other
i
will
go
to
my
chambers
to
await
the
verdict
of
the

the

then
another
at
half
after

a
rumor
flew
along
the
corridors
that
the

in

serafino

had
reached
a
verdict
and
were
coming

up
the

to
prevent

invented
an
excuse
by
which
he
lured

to
the
first
floor
of

the

suddenly
reassembled
out

and
poured
into

while
the

carrying
their
coats

slowly
in

faces
were
set
and
relentless

sauntered
over
and
seated
himself
nonchalantly
with
his
back
to
the
court
studying
their
faces
yes
he
told
himself
they
were
a
regular
set
of
hangmen
he
could
have
picked
a
tougher
bunch
if
had
his
choice
of
the

the

called

stated
that

of

inquired
the

guilty
or
not

tutt
gripped
the
balustrade
in

of

with

and
put
his

round

he
felt
that
now
in

murder
was
being
done
we
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
said
walsh
defiantly
there
was
a
momentary
silence
of
incredulity
then
babson
and
shouted
simultaneously
what
we
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
repeated
walsh
stubbornly
i
demand
that
the
jury
be
polled
cried
the
crestfallen
his
face
crimson
and
then
the
twelve
reiterated
severally
that
that
was
their
verdict
and
that
they
hearkened
unto
it
as
it
stood
recorded
and
that
they
were
entirely
satisfied
with
it
you
are
discharged
said
babson
in
icy
tones

the

incompetent

you
any

the
full

no

he
experienced
an
exultation
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
some
miracle
had
happened
what
was
it
unexpectedly
the
lawyer
felt
a
rough
warm
hand
clasped
over
his
own
upon
the
rail
and
heard
the
voice
of
walsh
with
its
rich
brogue
saying
at
first
we
could
see
that
there
was
much
to
be
said

said

eighty
years
before
in
a
cantonese
rabbit
warren
two
yellow
men
had
fought
over
a
white
woman
and
one
had
killed
the
other
they
had
belonged
to
different
societies
or
tongs
the
associates
of
the
murdered
man
had
avenged
his
death
by
slitting
the
throat
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
other
organization
and
these
in
turn
had
retaliated
thus
establishing
a
vendetta
which
became
part
and
parcel
of
the
lives
of
certain
families
as
naturally
and
unavoidably
as
birth
love
and
death
as
regularly
as
the
solstice
they
alternated
in
picking
each
other
off
branches
of
the
hip
leong
and
on
gee
tongs
sprang
up
in
san
francisco
and
new
york
and
the
feud
was
transferred
with
them
to
chatham
square
a
feud
imposing
a
sacred
obligation
rooted
in
blood
honor
and
religion
upon
every
member
who
rather
than
fail
to
carry
it
out
would
have
knotted
a
yellow
silken
cord
under
his
left
ear
and
swung
himself
gently
off
a
table
into
eternal
sleep
young
mock
hen
one
of
the
four
avengers
had
created
a
distinct
place
for
himself
in
chinatown
by
making
a
careful
study
of
new
york
psychology
he
was
a
chink
tall
and
supple
he
knew
very
well
how
to
capitalize
his
attractiveness
by
day
he
attended
columbia
university
as
a
special
student
in
applied
electricity
keeping
a
convenient
eye
meanwhile
on
three
coolies
whom
he
employed
to
run
the
college
laundry
on
morningside
heights
by
night
he
vicariously
operated
a
palace
on
seventh
avenue
where
congregated
the
worst
elements
of
the
tenderloin
but
his
heart
was
in
the
gambling
den
which
he
maintained
in
doyers
street
and
where
anyone
who
knew
the
knock
could
have
a
shell
of

a
christian
chinaman
that
is
to
say
purely
for
business
reasons
for
what
he
got
out
of
it
and
the
standing
that
it
gave
him
he
attended
the
rising
star
mission
and
also
frequented
hudson
house
the
social
settlement
where
miss
fanny
duryea
taught
him
to
play
and
other
exciting
parlor
games
and
read
to
him
from
books
adapted
to
an
american
child
of
ten
he
was
a
great
favorite
at
both
places
for
he
was
and
wore
an
expression
of
innocence
he
had
even
been
to
church
with
miss
duryea
temporarily
absenting
himself
for
that
purpose
of
a
sunday
morning
from
the
flat
where
unknown
to
her
of
course
he
lived
with
his
white
wife
emma
pratt
a
lady
of
highly
miscellaneous
antecedents
except
when
engaged
in
transacting
legal
or
oilier
business
with
the
municipal
sociologic
or
religious
world

which
times
his
vocabulary
consisted
only
of

most
rudimentary

a
fluent
and
even
vernacular

at

school
incidentally
he
was
the
head
of
the

which
controlled
and
dispensed

privileges
of

boast
that
there
had
never
been
so
little
trouble
with
the
foreign
element
since
the
administration
of
which
he
was
an
ornament
came
into
office
saw
quong
lee
emerge
from
his
doorway
in
doyers
street
just
before
four
the
following
thursday
and
slip
silently
along
under
the
shadow
of
the
eaves
toward
ah
grocery
and
instantly
sensed
something
peculiar
in
the
chink
walk
hello
quong
he
called
interposing
himself
where
you
goin
quong
paused
with
a
deprecating
gesture
of
widely
spread
open
palms

replied
blandly

mooney
ran
his
hands
over
the
rotund
body
frisking
him
for
a
possible
for
the
love
of
mike
he
exclaimed
tearing
open
quong
blouse
what
sort
of
an
undershirt
is
that
quong
grinned
broadly
as
the
detective
lifted
the
suit
of
mail
which
swayed
heavily
under
his
blue
blouse
from
his
shoulders
to
his
knees
continued
the
man

brewin
eh
he
knew
already
that
something
was
doing
in
the
tongs
from
his
wing
foo
must
weigh
eighty
pounds
he
whistled
i
like
to
see
the
pill
that
would
go
through
that
it
was
in
fact
a
medieval
corselet
of
finest
steel
mesh
capable
of
turning
an
elephant
bullet
ordered
mooney
finally
i
guess
you
safe
he
turned
back
in
the
direction
of
chatham
square
while
quong
resumed
his
tortoiselike
perambulation
toward
ah
fong
pell
and
doyers
streets
were
deserted
save
for
an
italian
woman
carrying
a
baby
and
were
pervaded
by
an
unnatural
and
suspicious
silence
most
of
the
shutters
on
the
lower
windows
were
down
ah
fong
subsequent
story
of
what
happened
was
simple
and
briefly
to
the
effect
that
quong
having
entered
his
shop
and
priced
various
litchi
nuts
and
pickled
starfruit
had
purchased
some
powdered
lizard
and
with
the
package
in
his
left
hand
had
opened
the
door
to
go
out
as
he
stood
there
with
his
right
hand
upon
the
knob
and
facing
the
afternoon
sun
four
shadows
fell
aslant
the
window
and
a
man
whom
he
positively
identified
as
sui
sing
emptied
a
bag
of
powder
afterward
proved
to
be
red
pepper
upon
quong
face
then
another
long
get
made
a
thrust
at
him
with
a
knife
the
effect
of
which
he
did
not
observe
as
almost
at
the
same
instant
mock
hen
felled
him
with
a
blow
upon
the
head
with
an
iron
bar
while
a
fourth
mock
ding
fired
four
shots
at
his
crumpling
body
with
a
revolver
one
of
which
glanced
off
and
fractured
a
very
costly
chien
lung
vase
and
ruined
four
boxes
of
tea
in
his
excitement
he
ducked
behind
the
counter
and
when
sufficiently
revived
he
crawled
forth
to
find
what
had
once
been
quong
lying
across
the
threshold
the
murderers
gone
and
the
italian
woman
prostrate
and
shrieking
with
a
hip
splintered
by
a
stray
bullet
on
the
sidewalk
outside
the
window
lay
the
remnants
of
the
bag
of
pepper
a
knife
broken
short
off
at
the
handle
a
heavy
bar
of
soft
iron
slightly
bent
and
a
partially
emptied
revolver
quong
suit
of
mail
had
effectually
protected
him
from
the
knife
thrust
and
the
revolver
shots
but
his
skull
was
crushed
beyond
repair
thus
was
the
murder
of
wah
sing
avenged
in
due
and
proper
form
detective
mooney
distant
not
more
than
two
hundred
feet
rushed
back
to
the
corner
at
the
sound
of
the
first
shot
just
in
time
to
catch
a
side
glimpse
of
mock
hen
as
he
raced
across
pell
street
and
disappeared
into
the
cellar
of
the
great
shanghai
tea
company
the
italian
woman
was
filling
the
air
with
her
outcries
but
the
detective
did
not
pause
in
his
hurtling
pursuit
he
was
too
late
however
the
cellar
door
withstood
all
his
efforts
to
break

mooney
from

now
then
the
two
of
them
threw
their
combined
weight
against
it
the
lock
flew
open
and
they
fell
forward
into
the
darkness
three
doors
leading
in
different
directions
met
the
glare
of
mooney
match
but
the
fugitive
had
a
start
of
at
least
four
minutes
which
was
three
and
a
half
more
than
he
required
mock
hen
took
the
of
the
three
doors
and
crept
along
a
passage
opening
into
an
empty
opium
parlor
back
of
the
hip
leong
clubroom
diving
beneath
one
of
the
bunks
he
inserted
his
body
between
the
lower
planking
at
the
back
and
the
cellar
wall
wormed
his
way
some
twelve
feet
raised
a
trap
and
emerged
into
a
tunnel
by
means
of
which
and
others
he
eventually
reached
the
end
of
the
block
and
the
rooms
of
his
friend
hong

here
he
changed
from
the
oriental
costume
according
to
chinese
etiquette
necessary
to
the
homicide
into
a
nobby
suit
of
american
clothes
put
on
a
false
mustache
and
walked
boldly
down

just
behind
him

a
mile
and
a
half
away
but
mock
took
his
time
full
minutes
elapsed
before
he
leisurely
climbed
the
steps
and
slipped
into
the
big
reading
room
there
was
no
one
there
and
mock
deftly
turned
back
the
hand
of
the
automatic
clock
over
the
platform
to
then
he
began
to
whistle
presently
miss

entered
from

with
pleasure
at
the

passed
through
the
door
and
presently
returned
to
the
back

changed
back

while

put

hell
he
added
under
his
breath
wo
this
make
peckham
sick
ephraim
tutt
just
finished
his
morning
mail
when
he
was
informed
that
wong
get
desired
an
interview
though
the
old
lawyer
did
not
formally
represent
the
hip
leong
tong
he
was
frequently
retained
by
its
individual
members
who
held
him
in
high
esteem
for
they
had
always
found
him
loyal
to
their
interests
and
as
much
a
stickler
for
honor
as
themselves
moreover
between
him
and
wong
get
there
existed
a
curious
sympathy
as
if
in
some
previous
state
of
existence
wong
get
might
have
been
tutt
and
tutt
wong
get
perhaps
however
it
was
merely
because
both
were
rather
weary
sad
and
worldly
wise
wong
get
did
not
come
alone
he
was
accompanied
by
two
other
hip
leongs
the
three
forming
the
law
committee
appointed
to
retain
the
best
available
counsel
to
defend
mock
hen
in
his
expansive
frock
coat
and
bowler
hat
wong
might
easily
have
excited
mirth
had
it
not
been
for
the
extreme
dignity
of
his
demeanor
they
were
there
he
stated
to
request
tutt
to
protect
the
interests
of
mock
hen
and
they
were
prepared
to
pay
a
cash
retainer
and
sign
a
written
contract
binding
themselves
to
a
balance
so
much
if
mock
should
be
convicted
so
much
if
acquitted
so
much
if
he
should
die
in
the
course
of
the
trial
without
having
been
either
convicted
or
acquitted
it
was
said
wong
get
gently
a
matter
of
grave
importance
and
they
would
be
glad
to
give
tutt
time
to
think
it
over
and
decide
upon
his
terms
suppose
then
that
they
should
return
at
noon
with
this
understanding
accordingly
they
departed
there
no
point
in
skinning
a
chink
just
because
he
is
a
chink
said
the
junior
tutt
when
his
partner
had
explained
the
situation
to
him
but
it
is
the
practise
and
they
ought
to
pay
well
what
do
you
call
well
inquired
tutt
oh
a
thousand
dollars
down
a
couple
more
if
he
convicted
and
five
altogether
if
he
acquitted
do
you
think
they
can
raise
that
amount
of
money
i
think
so
answered
tutt
it
might
be
a
good
deal
for
an
individual
chink
to
cough
up
on
his
own
account
but
this
is
a
coöperative
affair
mock
hen
did
kill
quong
lee
to
get
anything
out
of
it
for
himself
but
to
save
the
face
of
his
society
he
did
kill
him
at
all
declared
tutt
hardly
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
well
you
know
what
i
mean
said
tutt
he
was
there
insisted
tutt
he
was
way
over
in
fulton
market
buying
a
terrapin
that
is
what
if
i
were
district
attorney
i
should
call
a
mock
hen
with
a
mockturtle
defense
grunted
tutt
tutt
chuckled
i
shall
have
to
get
that
off
myself
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
or
it
might

the

returned
to
the
office
of

with

came
a
venerable
chinaman
in
native
costume
his
wrinkled
face
as
inscrutable
as
that
of
a
snapping
turtle
the
others
took
chairs
but
this
high
dignitary
preferred
to
sit
upon

heels
on
the

creating
something
of
the
impression
of
an
ancient
buddha

translated
for

proposed
by
tutt
after
which
there
was
a
long
pause
while
his

remained
immovable
without
even
the
flicker
of
an
eyelid
then
he
delivered
himself
in
an
interminable

of
gargles
and

supplemented
by
a
few
hisses
while

translated
with
rapid
dexterity
running
verbally
in

among

a

between

it
was

of

upon

appertaining
to

of
the

the

the
long
the

and
various
other

both
in

the
life
of
one
of
their

was
at

their
face
required
that
the
proceedings
should
be
as
dignified
as
possible
the
price
named
by
tutt
was
quite
inadequate
tutt
repressing
a
smile
passed
a
box
of
stogies
what
amount
he
inquired
through
wong
get
would
satisfy
the
face
of
the
duck
family
a
somewhat
lengthy
discussion
ensued
then
buddha
rendered
his
decision
the
honor
of
the
ducks
longs
and
fongs
would
not
be
satisfied
unless
tutt
received
five
thousand
dollars
down

more

tutt
assuming
an

impassivity
pondered
upon
the
matter
for
about
an
inch
of
stogy
and
then
informed
the
committee
that
the
terms
were
eminently
satisfactory
buddha
thereupon
removed
from
the
folds
of
his
tunic
a
gigantic
roll
of
soiled
bills
of
all
denominations
and
carefully
counting
out
five
thousand
dollars
placed
it
upon
the
table
h
remarked
tutt
when
he
learned
of
the
proceeding
face
is
fortune
look
here
expostulated
district
attorney
peckham
in
his
office
to
tutt
a
month
later
what
the
use
of
our
both
wasting
a
couple
of
weeks
trying
a
chinaman
who
is
bound
to
be
convicted
your
time
too
valuable
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
so
is
mine
we
got
three
white
witnesses
that
saw
him
do
it
and
a
couple
of
dozen
chinks
besides
he
does
stand
a
chance
but
just
because
he
is
a
chink
and
to
get
the
case
out
of
the
way
i
let
you
plead
him
to
murder
in
the
second
degree
what
do
you
say
he
tried
to
conceal
his
anxiety
by
nervously
lighting
a
cigar
he
would
have
given
a
year
salary
to
have
mock
hen
safely
up
the
river
even
on
a
conviction
for
manslaughter
in
the
third
for
the
newspapers
were
making
his
life
a
burden
with
their
constant
references
to
the
seeming
inability
of
the
police
department
and
district
attorney
office
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
feud
killings
in
the
chinatown
districts
what
use
was
it
they
demanded
to
maintain
the
expensive
machinery
of
criminal
justice
if
the
tongs
went
gayly
on
shooting
each
other
up
and
incidentally
taking
the
lives
of
innocent
bystanders
was
the
law
intended
to
cover
chinamen
as
much
as
italians
poles
greeks
and
niggers
and
now
that
one
of
these
murdering
celestials
had
been
caught
it
was
up
to
the
to
go
to
it
convict
him
and
send
him
to
the
chair
they
did
not
express
themselves
precisely
that
way
but
that
was
the
gist
of
it
but
peckham
knew
that
it
was
one
thing
to
catch
a
chinaman
even
and
another
to
convict
him
and
so
did
tutt
the
old
lawyer
smiled
blandly
after
the
fashion
of
the
hip
leong
tong
of
course
he
admitted
it
would
be
much
simpler
to
dispose
of
the
case
as
peckham
suggested
but
his
client
was
insistent
upon
his
innocence
and
seemed
to
have
an
excellent
alibi
he
regretted
therefore
that
he
had
no
choice
except
to
go
to
trial
then
groaned
peckham
we
may
as
well
take
the
winter
for
it
after
this
there
going
to
be
a
closed
season
on
chinamen
in
new
york
city
now
though
it
was
true
that
mock
hen
insisted
upon
his
innocence
he
had
not
insisted
upon
it
to
tutt
for
the
latter
had
not
seen
him
in
fact
the
old
lawyer
recognizing
what
the
law
did
not
namely
that
a
system
devised
for
the
trial
and
punishment
of
occidentals
is
totally
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
oriental
calmly
went
about
his
affairs
intrusting
to
bonnie
doon
of
his
office
the
task
of
interviewing
the
witnesses
furnished
by
wong
get
there
was
but
one
issue
for
the
jury
to
pass
upon
quong
lee
was
dead
and
his
honorable
soul
was
with
his
illustrious
ancestors
he
had
died
from
a
single
blow
upon
the
head
delivered
with
an
iron
bar
there
present
to
be
in
evidence
marked
exhibit
a
mock
hen
was
alleged
to
have
done
the
deed
had
he
there
would
be
nothing
for
tutt
to
do
but
to
the
witnesses
and
then
call
such
as
could
testify
to
mock
alibi
so
he
made
no
preparation
at
all
and
dismissed
the
case
from
his
mind
he
had
hardly
seen
a
dozen
chinamen
in
his
life
outside
of
a
laundry
on
the
morning
set
for
the
trial
tutt
having
been
delayed
by
an
accident
in
the
subway
entered
the
criminal
courts
building
only
a
moment
or
two
before
the
call
of
the
calendar
somewhat
preoccupied
he
did
not
notice
the
numerous
chinamen
who
dawdled
about
the
entrance
or
the
half
dozen
who
crowded
with
him
into
the
elevator
but
when
pat
the
elevator
man
called
second
floor
part
one
to
your
right
part
two
to
the
left
and
he
stepped
out
into
the
corridor
that
ran
round
the
inside
of
the
building
he
was
confronted
with
an
unusual
and
somewhat
ominous
spectacle
the
entire
hallway
on
two
sides
of
the
building
was
lined
with
chinamen
they
sat
there
motionless
as
images
faces
front
their
hands
in
their
laps
their
legs
crossed
beneath
them
if
anyone
appeared
in
the
offing
a
couple
of
hundred
pairs
of
glinting
eyes
shifted
automatically
and
followed
him
until
he
disappeared
but
otherwise
no
muscle
quivered
say
growled
hogan
judge
bender
private
attendant
who
was
the
first
to
run
the
gantlet
those
chinks
are
enough
to
give
you
the
willies
their
eyes
scared
me
to
death
sticking
me
through
the
back
even
dignified
judge
bender
himself
as
he
stalked
along
the
hall
preceded
by
two
police
officers
was
not
immune
from
a
slight
feeling
of
uncanniness
and
he
instinctively
drew
his
robe
round
his
legs
that
it
might
not
come
into
contact
with
those
curious
slippers
with
felt
soles
that
protruded
across
the
marble
slabs
eyes
right
they
had
picked
him
up
the
instant
he
stepped
out
of
the
private
elevator
the
four
hundred
of
them
if
he
turned
and
looked
they
were
seemingly
not
watching
him
but
if
he
dropped
his
glance
they
swung
back
in
a
single
moment
and
focused
themselves
upon
him
and
every
one
of
them
probably
had
a
gun
hidden
somewhere
in
his
baggy
pants
the
judge
confessed
to
not
liking
these
foreign
homicide
cases
you
never
could
tell
what
might
happen
or
when
somebody
was
going
to
get
the
death
sign
there
was
judge
deasy
he
had
the
whole
front
of
his
house
blown
clean
out
by
a
bomb
that
had
been
a
close
call
and
these
chinks
with
their
secret
oaths
and
rituals
they
think
nothing
at
all
of
jabbing
a
knife
into
you
he
did
fancy
it
at
all
and
as
he
hurried
along
supremely
conscious
of
the
deadly
cumulative
effect
of
those
beady
eyes
he
fancied
it
less
and
less
what
was
there
to
prevent
one
of
them
from
getting
right
up
in
court
and
putting
a
bullet
through
you
he
shivered
recalling
the
recent
assassination
of
a
judge
upon
the
bench
by
a
hindu
whom
he
had
sentenced
when
he
reached
his
robing
room
he
sent
for
captain
phelan
see
here
captain
he
directed
sharply
i
want
you
to
keep
all
those
chinamen
out
in
the
corridor
understand
i
got
to
let
some
of
in
judge
urged
phelan
you
got
to
have
an
interpreter
and
there
a
chinese
lawyer
associated
with
tutt
tutt
and
of
course
has
to
have
a
couple
of
so
know
what
going
on
y
see
judge
the
on
gee
tong
is
helping
the
prosecution
against
the
hip
leongs
so
both
sides
has
to
be
more
or
less
represented
well
make
sure
none
of
is
armed
ordered
judge
bender
i
like
these
cases
now
the
judge
being
recently
elected
and
unfamiliar
with
the
situation
did
not
realize
that
nothing
could
have
been
farther
from
the
oriental
mind
or
intention
than
an
attack
upon
the
officers
engaged
in
the
administration
of
local
justice
whom
they
regarded
merely
as
nuisances
what
these
chinamen
supremely
desired
was
to
be
allowed
to
settle
their
own
affairs
in
their
own
historic
and
traditional
way
the
way
of
the
revolver
the
silken
cord
the
knife
and
the
iron
bar
once
enmeshed
in
juridical
procedure
to
be
sure
they
were
not
averse
to
letting
it
run
its
course
on
the
bare
chance
that
it
might
automatically
accomplish
their
revenge
but
they
distrusted
it
being
brought
up
according
to
a
much
more
effective
system
one
which
when
it
wanted
to
punish
anybody
simply
reached
out
grabbed
him
by
the
pigtail
yanked
him
to
his
knees
and
sliced
off
his
head
this
american
justice
was
all
talk
words
words
words
from
their
point
of
view
judges
jurymen
and
prosecutors
were
useless
pawns
in
life
game
of
chess
perhaps
they
are
who
knows
when
judge
bender
entered
the
court
room
it
was
in
spite
of
his
injunction
full
of
blue
blouses
a
special
panel
of
two
hundred
talesmen
filled
the
first
half
dozen
rows
of
benches
the
others
being
occupied
by
witnesses
both
chinese
and
white
policemen
and
the
miscellaneous
human
flotsam
and
jetsam
that
always
manages
somehow
or
other
to
find
its
way
to
a
murder
trial
inside
the
rail
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
busy
in
conversation
with
three
cueless
chinamen
in
american
clothes
at
the
bar
sat
mock
hen
with
tutt
beside
him
flanked
by
wong
get
tutt
bonnie
doon
and
buddha
the
judge
beckoned
tutt
and
to
the
front
of
the
bench
is
there
any
chance
of
disposing
of
this
case
by
a
plea
he
inquired
looked
expectantly
at
tutt
who
shook
his
head
the
judge
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
about
six
weeks
answered
the
old
lawyer
quietly
what
ejaculated
judge
and
prosecutor
in
unison
a
day
or
two
less
perhaps
affirmed
tutt
but
likely
as
not
considerably
longer
i
shall
cut
it
down
as
much
as
i
can
announced
the
judge
appalled
at
the
prospect
i
shall
not
permit
this
trial
to
be
dragged
out
indefinitely
nothing
would
please
me
better
your
honor
said
tutt
with
the
shadow
of
a
smile
shall
we
proceed
to
select
the
jury
the
accuracy
of
tutt
prophecy
as
to
the
probable
length
of
the
trial
was
partially
demonstrated
when
it
developed
that
most
of
the
talesmen
had
a
pronounced
antipathy
to
chinese
murder
cases
and
a
prejudice
against
the
race
as
a
whole
in
fact
a
certain
subconscious
influence
affecting
most
of
them
was
formulated
by
the
talesman
to
be
rejected
who
in
a
moment
of
resentment
burst
forth
i
do
mind
trying
decent
american
criminals
but
i
hold
it
is
any
part
of
a
citizen
duty
to
try
chinamen
and
was
promptly
struck
off
the
jury
list
i
say
chief
disgustedly
declared
to
peckham
at
the
noon
recess
as
they
clinked
glasses
over
the
bar
at
pont
you
handed
me
a
ripe
juicy
messina
all
right
i
wo
be
able
to
get
a
jury
been
at
it
since
ten
and
we
have
lured
a
single
sucker
into
the
box
what
the
matter
inquired
the
apprehensively
i
ca
quite
make
out
answered
but
most
of
seem
to
have
a
sort
of
idea
that
to
kill
a
chinaman
ai
a
crime
but
a
virtue
well
do
tell
anybody
whispered
peckham
but
i
somewhat
of
that
way
of
thinking
myself
set
up
again
john
however
by
invoking
the
utmost
celerity
a
jury
was
at
last
selected
and
sworn
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
day
of
the
trial
as
a
jury
confidentially
admitted
to
peckham
it
was
much
but
what
could
you
expect
of
a
bunch
who
were
willing
to
swear
that
they
had
any
prejudice
against
a
chink
and
would
as
soon
acquit
him
as
a
white
man
the
truth
was
that
they
were
all
gentlemen
who
having
lost
their
jobs
were
willing
to
swear
to
anything
that
would
bring
them
in
two
dollars
a
day
the
more
days
the
better
and
it
is
historic
fact
that
during
the
days
of
mock
hen
prosecution
not
one
of
them
protested
at
being
kept
away
from
his
wife
and
children
his
business
or
his
pleasure
on
the
contrary
they
all
slumbered
peacefully
from
ten
until
four
and
when
the
trial
ended
on
the
whole
they
rather
regretted
that
it
was
over
the
only
genuine
opinion
regarding
the
case
being
that
the
chinks
were
all
as
funny
as
hell
and
that
tutt
was
a
bully
old
boy
the
evidence
respecting
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
quong
lee
made
little
impression
upon
them
seemingly
they
regarded
the
story
much
as
they
did
that
of
elisha
and
the
bears
or
bel
and
the
dragon
as
a
sort
of
apocryphal
narrative
which
they
were
required
to
listen
to
but
in
no
wise
bound
to
believe
they
were
much
interested
in
quong
suit
of
chain
mail
however
and
from
time
to
time
awoke
to
enjoy
the
various
verbal
encounters
between
the
judge
and
tutt
as
factors
in
the
proceedings
they
did
not
count
except
to
receive
their
two
dollars
per
diem
board
lodging
and
hack
fare
the
trial
of
mock
hen
being
conducted
in
a
foreign
language
the
first
judicial
step
was
the
swearing
of
an
interpreter
the
on
gees
had
promptly
produced
one
whom
told
the
court
was
a
very
learned
man
a
graduate
of
the
imperial
university
at
peking
and
a
son
of
the
sacred
dragon
be
that
as
it
may
he
was
not
prepossessing
in
his
appearance
and
tutt
assured
judge
bender
that
far
from
being
what
the
district
attorney
pretended
the
man
was
a
gambler
who
made
his
living
largely
by
blackmail
he
might
be
a
son
of
a
dragon
or
he
might
not
anyway
he
was
a
son
of
belial
an
interpreter
was
the
conduit
through
which
all
the
evidence
must
pass
if
the
official
were
biased
or
corrupt
the
testimony
would
be
distorted
colored
or
suppressed
now
he
tutt
had
an
interpreter
the
hong
su
against
whom
nothing
could
be
said
and
upon
whose
fat
head
rested
no
imputation
of
partiality
a
graduate
of
harvard
a
writer
of
note
a
sprang
to
his
feet
my
interpreter
says
your
interpreter
is
an
opium
smuggler
that
he
murdered
his
aunt
in
hong
kong
that
he
is
a
doctor
at
all
and
that
he
never
graduated
from
anything
except
a
joint
he
interjected
this
is
outrageous
cried
tutt
palpably
shocked
at
such
language
gentlemen
gentlemen
groaned
judge
bender
what
am
i
to
do
i
know
anything
about
these
men
one
looks
to
me
about
the
same
as
the
other
the
court
has
no
time
to
inquire
into
their
antecedents
they
may
both
be
learned
scholars
or
they
may
each
be
what
the
other
says
he
is
i
do
know
but
we
got
to
begin
to
try
this
case
sometime
it
was
finally
agreed
that
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
possible
question
of
partiality
there
should
be
two
interpreters
one
for
the
prosecution
and
one
for
the
defense
both
accordingly
were
sworn
and
the
first
witness
ah
fong
was
called
ask
him
if
he
understands
the
nature
of
an
oath
directed
the
interpreter
for
the
state
turned
to
ah
fong
and
said
something
sweetly
to
him
in
multitudinous
words
instantly
doctor
su
rose
indignantly
the
other
interpreter
was
not
putting
the
question
at
all
but
telling
the
witness
what
to
say
moreover
the
other
interpreter
belonged
to
the
on
gee
tong
he
stood
waving
his
arms
and
gobbling
like
an
infuriated
turkey
while
his
adversary
replied
in
similar
fashion
this
wo
do
snapped
the
judge
this
trial
will
degenerate
into
nothing
but
a
cat
fight
if
we
are
not
careful
then
a
bright
idea
suggested
itself
to
his
occidental
mind
suppose
i
appoint
an
official
umpire
to
say
which
of
the
other
two
interpreters
is
correct
and
let
them
decide
who
he
shall
be
this
proposition
was
received
with
grunts
of
satisfaction
by
the
two
antagonists
who
conferred
together
with
astonishing
amiability
and
almost
immediately
conducted
into
the
court
room
a
tall
emaciated
chinaman
who
they
alleged
was
entirely
satisfactory
to
both
of
them
he
was
accordingly
sworn
as
a
third
interpreter
and
the
trial
began
again
it
was
observed
that
thereafter
there
was
no
dispute
whatever
regarding
the
accuracy
of
the
testimony
and
as
each
interpreter
was
paid
for
his
services
at
the
rate
of
ten
dollars
a
day
it
was
rumored
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
arranged
by
agreement
between
the
two
societies
which
divided
the
money
amounting
to
some
eighteen
hundred
dollars
between
them
but
as
afterward
asked
peckham
how
in
thunder
could
you
tell
the
court
troubles
had
however
only
begun
ah
fong
was
a
person
who
gave
an
impression
of
desiring
to
make
himself
generally
agreeable
he
was
of
course
the
star
witness
if
a
chinaman
can
ever
be
a
star
witness
and
presumably
had
been
carefully
schooled
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
should
give
his
testimony
he
and
he
alone
had
seen
the
whole
tragedy
from
beginning
to
end
he
it
was
if
anybody
who
would
tuck
mock
hen
comfortably
into
his
coffin
the
problem
of
the
interpreters
having
been
solved
fong
settled
himself
comfortably
in
the
witness
chair
crossed
his
hands
upon
his
stomach
and
looked
complacently
at
mock
hen
well
now
let
get
along
adjured
his
honor
swear
the
witness
tutt
immediately
rose
if
the
court
please
said
he
i
object
to
the
swearing
of
the
witness
unless
it
is
made
to
appear
that
he
will
regard
himself
as
bound
by
the
oath
as
administered
now
this
man
is
a
chinaman
i
should
like
to
ask
him
a
preliminary
question
or
two
that
seems
fair
agreed
the
court
do
you
see
any
reason
why
tutt
should
interrogate
the
witness
oh
let
me
qualify
my
own
witness
retorted
fretfully
ah
fong
will
you
respect
the
oath
to
testify
truthfully
about
to
be
administered
to
you
the
interpreter
delivered
a
broadside
of
chinese
at
ah
fong
who
listened
attentively
and
replied
at
equal
length
then
the
interpreter
went
at
him
again
and
again
ah
fong
affably
responded
it
was
interminable
the
two
muttered
and
chortled
at
each
other
until
losing
patience
jumped
up
and
called
out
what
all
this
ca
you
ask
him
a
simple
question
and
get
a
simple
answer
this
is
a
debating
society
the
interpreter
held
up
his
hand
indicating
that
the
prosecutor
should
have
patience
he
concluded
replied
ah
fong
thank
heaven
that
over
sighed
the
interpreter
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
he
says
yes
he
declared
dramatically
it
the
longest
yes
i
ever
heard
audibly
remarked
the
foreman
who
was
feeling
his
oats
does
not
that
satisfy
you
inquired
the
court
of
tutt
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
does
not
replied
the
latter
has
simply
asked
whether
he
will
keep
his
oath
his
reply
sheds
no
light
on
whether
his
religious
belief
is
such
that
it
would
obligate
him
to
respect
an
oath
well
ask
him
yourself
snorted
ah
fong
do
you
believe
in
any
god
inquired
tutt
he
says
yes
answered
the
interpreter
after
the
usual
interchange
what
god
do
you
believe
in
persisted
tutt
suddenly
ah
fong
made
answer
without
the
intervention
of
the
interpreter
when
i
in
this
country
he
replied
complacently
in
english
i
gees
clist
when
i
in
china
i
chinese
god
does
your
honor
hold
that
an
obliging
acquiescence
in
local
theology
constitutes
such
a
religious
belief
as
to
make
this
man
oath
sacred
inquired
tutt
the
judge
smiled
i
do
see
why
not
he
declared
there
is
any
precedent
as
far
as
i
am
aware
but
he
says
he
believes
in
the
deity
is
that
enough
not
unless
he
believes
that
the
deity
will
punish
him
if
he
breaks
his
oath
answered
tutt
let
me
try
him
on
that
ah
fong
do
you
think
god
will
punish
you
if
you
tell
a
lie
fong
looked
blank
the
interpreter
fired
a
few
salvos
he
says
it
makes
a
difference
the
kind
of
oath
suppose
it
is
a
promise
to
tell
the
truth
he
says
what
kind
of
a
promise
a
promise
on
the
bible
answered
tutt
patiently
he
says
what
god
you
mean
countered
the
interpreter
oh
any
god
roared
tutt
the
interpreter
after
a
long
parley
made
reply
ah
fong
says
there
is
no
binding
oath
except
on
a
chicken
head
judge
bender
and
tutt
gazed
at
one
another
helplessly
well
there
you
are
exclaimed
the
lawyer
oath
any
oath
at
all
what
kind
of
a
chicken
head
a
white
rooster
quite
so
nodded
tutt
your
honor
i
object
to
this
witness
being
sworn
by
any
oath
or
in
any
form
except
on
the
head
of
a
white
rooster
well
i
do
happen
to
have
a
white
rooster
about
me
remarked
while
the
jury
rocked
with
glee
ask
him
if
something
else
wo
do
a
big
book
for
instance
the
interpreter
put
the
question
and
then
shook
his
head
according
to
ah
fong
there
was
no
virtue
in
books
whatever
either
large
or
small
on
some
occasions
an
oath
could
be
properly
taken
on
a
broken
plate
also
white
but
not
in
murder
cases
it
was
chicken
or
nothing
are
you
not
willing
to
waive
the
formality
of
an
oath
mr
tutt
asked
the
judge
in
slight
impatience
and
wave
my
client
into
the
chair
demanded
the
lawyer
no
sir
i
do
see
what
we
can
do
except
to
adjourn
court
until
you
can
procure
the
necessary
poultry
announced
judge
bender
even
then
we
ca
slaughter
them
in
court
we
have
to
find
some
suitable
place
why
not
kill
one
rooster
and
swear
all
the
witnesses
at
once
suggested
tutt
in
a
moment
of
inspiration
my
god
chief
exclaimed
at
four
there
ai
a
white
rooster
to
be
had
anywhere
hens
yes
by
the
hundred
but
roosters
are
extinct
tomorrow
will
be
the
day
of
this
prosecution
and
not
a
witness
sworn
yet
however
a
poultryman
was
presently
discovered
who
agreed
simply
for
what
advertising
there
was
in
it
to
furnish
a
crate
of
white
roosters
a
hatchet
and
a
headsman
block
and
to
have
them
in
the
basement
of
the
building
promptly
at
ten
accordingly
at
that
hour
judge
bender
convened
part
ix
of
the
general
sessions
in
the
court
room
and
then
adjourned
downstairs
where
all
the
prospective
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
were
lined
up
in
a
body
and
told
to
raise
their
right
hands
meantime
clerk
mcguire
was
handed
the
hatchet
and
approached
the
coop
with
obvious
misgivings
ah
fong
had
already
given
a
dubious
approval
to
the
sex
and
quality
of
the
fowls
inside
and
naught
remained
but
to
submit
the
proper
oath
and
remove
the
head
of
the
unfortunate
victim
a
large
crowd
of
policemen
witnesses
reporters
loafers
truckmen
and
others
drawn
by
the
unusual
character
of
the
proceedings
had
assembled
and
now
proceeded
without
regard
for
the
requirements
of
judicial
dignity
to
encourage
mcguire
in
his
capacity
of
executioner
by
profane
shouts
and
jeers
to
do
his
deadly
deed
but
the
clerk
had
had
no
experience
with
chickens
and
in
bashfully
groping
for
the
selected
rooster
allowed
several
other
occupants
of
the
crate
to
escape
instantly
the
air
was
filled
with
fluttering
squawking
fowls
while
fifty
frenzied
police
officers
and
chinamen
attempted
vainly
to
reduce
them
to
captivity
again
in
the
midst
of
the
mêlée
mcguire
caught
his
rooster
and
fearful
lest
it
should
escape
him
managed
somehow
to
decapitate
it
the
body
however
had
been
flopping
around
spasmodically
several
seconds
upon
the
floor
before
he
realized
that
the
oath
had
not
been
administered
and
his
voice
suddenly
rose
above
the
pandemonium
in
an
excited
brogue
hold
up
your
hands
you
you
do
solemnly
swear
that
in
the
case
of
the
people
against
mock
hen
you
will
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
help
you
god
but
the
interpreter
was
at
that
moment
engaged
in
clasping
to
his
bosom
a
struggling
rooster
and
was
totally
unable
to
fulfill
his
functions
meantime
the
jury
highly
edified
at
this
illustration
of
the
administration
of
justice
gazed
down
upon
the
spectacle
from
the
stairs
this
farce
has
gone
far
enough
declared
judge
bender
disgustedly
we
will
return
to
the
court
room
put
those
roosters
back
where
they
belong
once
more
the
participants
ascended
to
part
ix
and
ah
fong
took
his
seat
in
the
witness
chair
the
interpreter
blouse
was
covered
with
and
one
of
his
thumbs
was
bleeding
profusely
ask
the
witness
if
the
oath
that
he
has
now
taken
will
bind
his
conscience
directed
the
court
again
the
interpreter
and
ah
fong
held
converse
he
says
translated
that
official
calmly
that
the
chicken
oath
is
all
right
in
china
but
that
it
is
no
good
in
united
states
and
that
anyway
the
proper
form
of
words
was
not
used
good
lord
ejaculated
where
am
i
me
tell
truth
all
light
suddenly
announced
ah
fong
in
english
go
ahead
shoot
and
he
smiled
an
inscrutable
oriental
smile
the
jury
burst
into
laughter
he
stringing
you
the
foreman
kindly
informed
who
cursed
silently
go
on
mister
district

examine
the
witness
directed
the
judge
i
shall
permit
no
further
variations
upon
the
established
forms
of
procedure
then
at
last
and
not
until
then
on
the
morning
of
the
day
did
ah
fong
tell
his
simple
story
and
the
jury
for
the
first
time
learn
what
it
was
all
about
but
by
then
they
had
entirely
ceased
to
care
being
engrossed
in
watching
tutt
at
his
daily
amusement
of
torturing
into
a
state
of
helpless
exasperation
ah
fong
gave
his
testimony
with
a
clarity
of
detail
that
left
nothing
to
be
desired
and
he
was
corroborated
in
most
respects
by
the
italian
woman
who
identified
mock
hen
as
the
chinaman
with
the
iron
bar
their
evidence
was
supplemented
by
that
of
bull
neck
burke
and
miss
malone
who
also
were
positive
that
they
had
seen
mock
running
from
the
scene
of
the
murder
at
exactly
tutt
hardly
fong
at
all
but
with
burke
he
pursued
very
different
tactics
speedily
rousing
the
wrestler
to
such
a
condition
of
fury
that
he
was
hardly
articulate
for
the
old
lawyer
gently
hinted
that
burke
was
inventing
the
whole
story
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
his
friends
in
the

he
demanded

his

bull

allowed
his
head
to
sink
still
farther
into
the
vast
bulk
of
his
immense
torso
strangely
resembling
in
this
position
the
fabled
anthropophagi
whose
heads
are
reputed
thus
to
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
then
throwing
out
his

he
announced
proudly
between

repeated

with

exclaimed

what

looked

disgustedly
at

as

to

what

he
explained
um
remarked
tutt
who
invited
you
to
testify
in
this
case
mr
mooney
oh
you
a
friend
of
mooney
that
is
all
now
it
is
apparent
from
these
questions
and
answers
that
burke
had
testified
to
nothing
to
his
discredit
and
had
conducted
himself
as
a
gentleman
and
a
sportsman
according
to
his
best
lights
yet
owing
to
the
subtle
suggestions
contained
in
tutt
inflections
and
demeanor
the
jury
leaped
unhesitatingly
to
the
conclusion
that
here
was
a
man
so
ignorant
and
debased
that
if
he
were
not
deliberately
lying
he
was
being
made
a
by
the
police
in
the
interest
of
the
on
gee
tong
miss
malone
fared
even
worse
for
after
a
preliminary
skirmish
she
flatly
refused
to
give
tutt
or
the
jury
any
information
whatever
regarding
her
past
life
while
mooney
of
course
labored
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
testimony
under
the
curse
of
being
a
policeman
one
of
that
class
whom
most
jurymen
take
pride
in
saying
they
hold
in
natural
distrust
in
a
word
the
white
witnesses
to
the
dastardly
murder
of
quong
lee
created
a
general
impression
of
unreliability
upon
the
minds
of
the
jury
who
wholly
failed
to
realize
the
somewhat
obvious
truth
that
the
witnesses
to
a
crime
in
chinatown
will
naturally
if
not
inevitably
be
persons
who
either
reside
in
or
frequent
that
locality
days
had
now
been
consumed
in
the
trial
and
as
yet
no
chinese
witnesses
except
ah
fong
had
been
called
now
however
they
appeared
in
cohorts
though
mooney
had
sworn
that
the
streets
were
practically
empty
at
the
time
of
the
homicide
chinese
witnesses
swore
positively
that
they
had
been
within
easy
view
claiming
variously
to
have
been
behind
doors
peeking
through
shutters
at
upper
windows
and
even
on
the
roofs
all
had
identified
mock
hen
as
the
murderer
and
none
of
them
had
ever
heard
of
either
the
on
gee
or
the
hip
leong
tong
tutt
could
not
shake
them
upon
and
began
to
show
signs
of
renewed
confidence
each
testified
to
substantially
the
same
story
and
they
occupied
seventeen
full
days
in
the
telling
so
that
when
the
prosecution
rested
days
had
been
consumed
since
the
first
talesman
had
been
called
the
trial
had
sunk
into
a
dull
unbroken
monotony
as
tutt
said
of
the
vain
repetitions
of
the
heathen
yet
the
police
and
the
district
attorney
had
done
all
that
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
of
them
they
were
simply
confronted
by
the
very
obvious
fact
a
condition
and
not
a
theory
that
the
legal
processes
of
jurisprudence
are
of
slight
avail
in
dealing
with
people
of
another
race
now
it
is
possible
that
even
had
tutt
put
in
no
defense
whatever
the
jury
might
have
refused
to
convict
for
there
was
a
curious
air
of
unreality
surrounding
the
whole
affair
it
all
seemed
somehow
as
if
assuming
that
it
had
ever
taken
place
at
all
it
had
occurred
in
some
other
world
and
in
some
other
age
perhaps
under
what
might
have
been
practically
a
direction
of
the
court
a
verdict
of
conviction
might
have
been
returned
but
it
is
doubtful
the
more
witnesses
testified
to
exactly
the
same
thing
in
precisely
the
same
words
the
less
likely
it
appeared
to
be
but
tutt
was
taking
no
chances
and
upon
the
day
of
the
trial
at
a
nod
from
the
bench
he
opened
his
case
never
had
he
been
more
serious
never
more
persuasive
abandoning
every
suggestion
of
frivolity
he
weighed
the
testimony
of
each
white
witness
and
pointed
out
its
obvious
lack
of
probative
value
not
one
he
said
except
the
italian
woman
had
had
more
than
a
fleeting
glance
of
the
face
of
the
man
now
accused
of
the
crime
such
an
identification
was
useless
the
chinamen
were
patently
lying
they
had
not
been
there
at
all
would
any
member
of
the
jury
hang
a
dog
even
a
yellow
one
on
such
testimony
of
course
not
much
less
a
human
being
the
people
had
called
forty
witnesses
to
prove
that
mock
hen
had
killed
quong
lee
it
made
no
difference
the
on
gee
could
have
just
as
easily
produced
four
hundred
moreover
tutt
did
a
very
daring
thing
he
pronounced
all
chinese
testimony
in
an
american
court
of
justice
as
absolutely
valueless
and
boasted
that
for
every
chinaman
who
swore
mock
hen
was
guilty
he
would
bring
forward
two
who
would
swear
him
innocent
the
thing
was
as
he
had
carefully
explained
to
bonnie
doon
to
prove
that
mock
was
a
good
chinaman
and
if
the
jury
did
not
believe
that
there
was
any
such
animal
to
convince
them
that
it
was
possible
his
first
task
however
was
to
polish
off
the
chinese
testimony
by
calling
the
witnesses
who
had
been
secured
under
the
guidance
of
wong
get
he
admitted
afterward
that
in
view
of
the
exclusion
law
he
had
not
supposed
there
were
so
many
chinamen
in
the
united
states
for
they
crowded
the
corridors
and
staircases
of
the
criminal
courts
building
arriving
in
companies
the
wong
family
the
mocks
the
fongs
the
lungs
the
sues
and
others
of
the
sacred
hip
sing
society
from
near
at
hand
and
from
distant
parts
from
brooklyn
and
flatbush
from
flushing
and
far
rockaway
from
hackensack
and
hoboken
from
trenton
and
scranton
from
buffalo
and
saratoga
from
chicago
and
louis
and
each
and
every
one
of
them
swore
positively
upon
the
severed
neck
of
the
whitest
rooster
the
broken
fragments
of
the
whitest
of
porcelain
plates
the
holiest
of
books
that
he
had
been
present
in
person
at
fulton
market
in
new
york
city
at
precisely
in
the
afternoon
and
assisted
mock
hen
the
defendant
in
selecting
and
purchasing
a
terrapin
for
stew
tutt
grinned
at
the
jury
and
the
jury
grinned
affectionately
back
at
tutt
indeed
after
the
length
of
time
they
had
all
been
together
they
had
almost
as
much
respect
for
him
as
for
the
judge
upon
the
bench
the
whole
court
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
tutt
club
of
which
even
was
a
member
now
said
tutt
i
will
call
a
few
witnesses
to
show
you
what
kind
of
a
man
this
is
whom
these
highbinders
accuse
of
the
crime
of
murder
mock
rolling
his
eyes
heavenward
assumed
an
expression
of
infantile
helplessness
and
trust
do
overdo
it
growled
tutt
just
look
kind
of
gentle
so
mock
looked
as
gentle
as
a
suckling
dove
while
two
professors
from
columbia
university
three
of
his
landlords
in
his
more
reputable
business
enterprises
the
superintendent
of
the
rising
sun
mission
four
officers
a
fireman
and
an
investigator
for
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
sin
swore
upon
holy
writ
and
with
all
sincerity
that
mock
hen
was
not
only
a
person
of
the
most
excellent
character
and
reputation
but
a
christian
and
a
gentleman
and
then
tutt
played
his
trump
card
i
will
call
miss
frances
duryea
of
hudson
house
he
announced
miss
duryea
will
you
kindly
take
the
witness
chair
miss
fanny
modestly
rose
from
her
seat
in
the
rear
of
the
room
and
came
forward
no
one
could
for
an
instant
doubt
the
honesty
and
impartiality
of
this
devoted
woman
who
surrendering
the
comforts
and
luxuries
of
her
home
uptown
to
which
she
was
well
entitled
by
reason
of
her
age
was
devoting
herself
to
a
life
of
service
if
a
woman
like
that
thought
the
jury
was
ready
to
vouch
for
mock
good
character
why
waste
any
more
time
on
the
case
but
miss
fanny
was
to
do
much
more
miss
duryea
began
tutt
do
you
know
the
defendant
yes
sir
i
do
she
answered
quietly
how
long
have
you
known
him
six
years
do
you
know
his
reputation
for
peace
and
quiet
miss
fanny
half
turned
to
the
judge
and
then
faced
the
jury
he
is
one
of
the
sweetest
characters
i
have
ever
known
she
replied
and
i
have
known
many
oh
i
object
interrupted
this
lady
ca
be
permitted
to
testify
to
anything
like
that
she
must
be
limited
by
the
rules
of
evidence
with
one
movement
the
jury
wheeled
and
glared
at
him
i
guess
this
lady
can
say
anything
she
wants
declared
the
foreman
chivalrously
sank
down
in
his
seat
what
was
the
use
go
on
please
gently
directed
tutt
as
i
was
saying
mock
hen
is
a
very
remarkable
character
responded
miss
fanny
he
is
devoted
to
the
mission
and
to
us
at
the
settlement
i
would
trust
him
absolutely
in
regard
to
anything
thank
you
said
tutt
smiling
benignly
now
miss
duryea
did
you
see
mock
hen
at
any
time
on
may
sixth
instantly
the
jury
showed
renewed
signs
of
life
may
sixth
that
was
the
day
of
the
murder
i
did
answered
miss
fanny
with
conviction
he
came
to
see
me
at
hudson
house
in
the
afternoon
and
while
we
were
talking
the
clock
struck
four
the
jury
looked
at
one
another
and
nodded
well
i
guess
that
settles
this
case
announced
the
foreman
right
echoed
a
talesman
behind
him
i
object
wailed
this
is
entirely
improper
quite
so
ruled
judge
bender
sternly
the
jurymen
will
not
make
any
remarks
but
your
honor
we
all
agreed
at
recess
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
announced
the
foreman
and
now
this
testimony
simply
clinches
it
why
go
on
with
it
that
so
ejaculated
another
let
us
go
judge
tutt
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
easy
gentlemen
he
cautioned
the
judge
shrugged
his
shoulders
frowning
this
is
very
irregular
he
said
then
he
beckoned
to
and
the
two
whispered
together
for
several
minutes
while
all
over
the
court
room
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
sat
there
so
patiently
for
days
there
was
a
prolonged
and
ecstatic
wriggling
of
arms
and
legs
instinctively
they
all
knew
that
the
farce
was
over
the
assistant
district
attorney
returned
to
his
table
but
did
not
sit
down
if
the
court
please
he
said
rather
wearily
the
last
witness
miss
duryea
by
her
testimony
which
i
personally
am
quite
ready
to
accept
as
truthful
has
interjected
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
defendant
guilt
into
what
otherwise
would
in
my
opinion
be
a
case
for
the
jury
if
mock
hen
was
at
hudson
house
nearly
two
miles
from
pell
and
doyers
streets
at
four
on
the
afternoon
of
the
homicide
manifestly
he
could
not
have
been
one
of
the
assailants
of
quong
lee
at
one
minute
past
four
i
am
satisfied
that
no
jury
would
convict
not
on
your
life
snorted
the
foreman
and
i
therefore
went
on

the
court
to
direct
an
acquittal

tutt
nor
tutt
was
any
such
great
shakes
had
tutt
dared
to
let
her
know
of
many
of
the
schemes
which
he
devised
for
the
profit
or
safety
of
his
clients
she
would
have
thought
less
of
him
still
in
fact
she
might
have
parted
with
him
forever
in
a
sense
tutt
was
an
exacting
woman
though
she
somewhat
reluctantly
consented
to
view
the
hours
from
nine
to
five
in
her
day
as
belonging
to
the
law
she
emphatically
regarded
the
rest
of
the
hours
as
belonging
to
her
the
law
may
be
as
judge
holmes
has
called
it
a
jealous
mistress
but
in
the
case
of
tutt
it
was
not
nearly
so
jealous
as
his
wife
so
tutt
was
compelled
to
walk
the
path
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
on
the
whole
he
liked
it
well
enough
but
there
were
times
usually
in
the
spring
when
without
being
conscious
of
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
mourned
his
lost
youth
for
tutt
was
only
and
he
had
had
a
grandfather
who
had
lived
strenuously
to
upward
of
twice
that
age
he
was
vigorous
sprightly
and
as
hard
as
nails
even
if
somewhat
resembling
in
his
contours
the
late
pickwick
tutt
was
tall
spare
capable
and
sardonic
she
made
tutt
comfortable
but
she
no
longer
appealed
to
his
sense
of
romance
still
she
held
him
as
the
playwright
hath
said
it
is
good
looks
they
want
but
good
nature
if
a
warm
welcome
wo
hold
them
cold
cream
wo
however
tutt
got
neither
looks
nor
cold
cream
his
welcome
in
fact
was
warm
only
if
he
stayed
out
too
late
and
then
the
later
the
warmer
his
relationship
to
his
wife
was
prosaic
respectful
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
occasionally
thought
of
her
as
exceedingly
unattractive
in
a
word
tutt
performed
her
wifely
functions
in
a
purely
way
anything
else
would
have
seemed
to
her
unseemly
she
dressed
in
a
manner
that
would
have
been
regarded
as
conservative
even
on
beacon
hill
she
had
no
intention
of
making
an
old
fool
of
herself
or
of
letting
him
be
one
either
when
people
had
been
married
thirty
years
they
could
take
some
things
for
granted
few
persons
therefore
had
ever
observed
tutt
in
the
act
of
caressing
tutt
and
there
were
those
who
said
that
he
never
had
frankly
she
was
a
trifle
forbidding
superficially
not
the
sort
of
person
to
excite
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
and
occasionally
as
we
have
hinted
in
the
spring
tutt
yearned
for
a
little
sentiment
he
did
his
yearning
however
entirely
on
the
side
and
within
those
hours
consecrated
to
the
law
in
his
wife
society
he
yearned
not
at
all
in
her
company
he
carefully
kept
his
thoughts
and
his
language
inside
the
innermost
circle
of
decorum
at
home
his
talk
was
entirely
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
and
dealt
principally
with
politics
and
the
feminist
movement
in
which
abigail
was
deeply
interested
and
by
this
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
at
other
times
or
places
tutt
was
anything
but
conventionally
proper
he
was
not
he
only
yearned
to
be
well
knowing
that
he
was
deficient
in
courage
if
not
in
everything
else
but
habit
or
no
habit
likely
or
unlikely
tutt
had
no
intention
of
taking
any
chances
so
far
as
tutt
was
concerned
if
he
did
not
reach
home
precisely
at
six
explanations
were
in
order
and
if
he
came
in
half
an
hour
later
he
had
to
demonstrate
his
integrity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
according
to
the
established
rules
of
evidence
perhaps
tutt
did
wisely
to
hold
tutt
thus
in
leash
considering
the
character
of
many
of
the
firm
clients
for
it
was
quite
impossible
to
conceal
the
nature
of
the
practise
of
tutt
tutt
much
of
which
figured
flamboyantly
in
the
newspapers
some
women
would
have
taken
it
for
granted
under
like
circumstances
that
their
husbands
had
acquired
a
touch
at
least
of
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
even
if
they
remained
quite
harmless
abigail
countenanced
no
thought
of
any
demoralization
in
her
spouse
to
her
he
was
like
the
artist
who
smears
himself
and
his
smock
with
paint
while
in
his
studio
but
appears
at
dinner
in
spotless
linen
without
even
a
whiff
of
benzine
about
him
to
suggest
his
occupation
so
tutt
though
hand
and
glove
in
his
office
with
the
most
notorious
of
the
elite
of
longacre
square
came
home
to
supper
with
the
naiveté
and
innocence
of
a
theological
student
for
whom
an
evening
at
a
picture
show
is
the
height
of
dissipation
yet
tutt
was
no
more
of
a
doctor
jekyll
and
hyde
than
most
of
us
merely
his
daily
transition
was
a
little
more
abrupt
and
when
all
is
said
and
done
most
of
the
devices
invented
by
his
fertile
little
brain
to
further
the
interests
of
his
clients
were
no
more
worthy
of
condemnation
than
those
put
forward
by
far
and
much
more
celebrated
attorneys
not
that
tutt
was
blind
to
the
dangers
to
which
her
husband
by
virtue
of
his
occupation
was
exposed
far
from
it
indeed
she
made
it
her
business
to
pay
periodical
visits
to
the
office
ostensibly
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
properly
cleaned
and
the
windows
washed
but
in
reality
or
at
least
so
tutt
suspected
to
find
out
whether
the
personnel
was
entirely
suitable
for
a
firm
of
their
standing
and
particularly
for
a
junior
partner
of
his
susceptibilities
but
she
never
discovered
anything
to
give
her
the
slightest
cause
for
alarm
the
dramatis
personae
of
the
offices
of
tutt
tutt
were
characteristic
of
the
firm
none
of
their
employees
except
miss
sondheim
the
lady
stenographer
and
willie
the
office
boy
being
under
forty
years
of
age
when
not
engaged
in
running
errands
or
fussing
over
his
album
willie
spent
most
of
his
time
teasing
old
scraggs
the
scrivener
an
unsuccessful
teetotaler
a
faint
odor
of
alcohol
emanated
from
the
cage
in
which
he
performed
his
labors
and
lent
an
atmosphere
of
cheerfulness
to
what
might
otherwise
have
seemed
to
broadway
clients
an
unsympathetic
environment
though
there
were
long
annual
periods
during
which
he
was
as
sober
as
a
kansas
judge
the
winds
of
march
were
apt
however
to
take
hold
of
him
perhaps
it
was
the
spring
in
his
case
also
the
backbone
of
the
establishment
was
miss
minerva
wiggin
in
every
law
office
there
is
usually
some
one
person
who
keeps
the
shop
going
sometimes
it
is
a
man
if
so
he
is
probably
a
sublimated
stenographer
or
law
clerk
who
having
worked
for
years
to
get
himself
admitted
to
the
bar
finds
after
achieving
that
ambition
that
he
has
neither
the
ability
nor
the
inclination
to
brave
the
struggle
for
a
livelihood
by
himself
perchance
as
a
youth
he
has
had
visions
of
himself
arguing
test
cases
before
the
court
of
appeals
while
the
leaders
of
the
bar
hung
upon
his
every
word
of
an
office
crowded
with
millionaire
clients
and
servile
employees
even
as
he
is
servile
to
the
man
for
whom
he
labors
for
a
miserly
ten
dollars
a
week
his
ambition
takes
him
by
the
hand
and
leads
him
to
high
places
from
which
he
gazes
down
into
the
land
of
his
future
prosperity
and
greatness
the
law
seems
a
mysterious
alluring
fascinating
profession
combining
the
romance
of
the
drama
with
the
gratifications
of
the
intellect
he
springs
to
answer
his
master
bell
he
sits
up
until
all
hours
running
down
citations
and
making
extracts
from
opinions
he
rushes
to
court
and
answers
the
calendar
and
sometimes
carries
the
lawyer
brief
case
and
attends
him
throughout
a
trial
three
years
go
by
five
and
he
finds
that
he
is
still
doing
the
same
thing
he
is
now
a
member
of
the
bar
he
has
become
the
managing
clerk
he
attends
to
fairly
important
matters
engages
the
office
force
superintends
transfer
of
title
occasionally
argues
a
motion
five
years
more
go
by
and
perhaps
his
salary
is
raised
a
trifle
more
then
one
day
he
awakes
to
the
realization
that
his
future
is
to
be
only
that
of
a
trusted
servitor
perchance
he
is
married
and
has
a
baby
the
time
has
come
for
him
to
choose
whether
he
will
go
forth
and
put
his
fortune
to
the
test
to
win
or
lose
it
all
or
settle
down
into
the
position
of
faithful
legal
hired
man
he
is
getting
a
bit
bald
he
has
had
one
or
two
tussles
with
his
bank
about
accidental
overdrafts
the
world
looks
pretty
bleak
outside
and
the
big
machine
of
the
law
goes
grinding
on
heartless
inevitable
who
is
he
to
challenge
the
future
the
old
job
is
fairly
easy
they
ca
get
on
without
him
they
say
here
is
where
he
belongs
he
knows
his
business
give
him
his
hundred
a
year
and
let
him
stay
that
is
binks
or
calkins
or
shivers
or
any
one
of
those
worried
men
who
sit
in
the
outer
office
behind
a
desk
strewn
with
papers
and
make
sure
that
no
mistakes
have
been
made
to
them
every
doubtful
question
of
practise
is
referred
and
they
answer
instantly
sometimes
wrongly
but
always
instantly
they
know
the
last
day
for
serving
the
demurrer
in
bilbank
against
terwilliger
and
whether
or
not
you
can
tax
a
referee
fee
as
a
disbursement
in
a
bill
of
costs
they
are
experts
on
the
precise
form
for
orders
in
matrimonial
actions
and
the
rule
in
regard
to
filing
a
summons
and
complaint
in
oneida
county
they
stand
between
the
members
of
the
firm
and
disagreeable
clients
they
hire
and
discharge
the
office
boys
they
do
everything
from
writing
a
brief
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
down
to
making
the
contract
with
the
window
cleaners
they
are
the
only
lawyers
who
really
know
anything
and
they
were
once
promising
young
men
who
have
found
out
at
last
that
life
and
the
books
are
very
far
apart
but
they
run
the
works
and
make
the
law
a
profession
for
the
rest
of
us
they
are
always
there
others
come
grow
older
go
away
but
they
remain
many
of
them
drink
all
of
which
would
be
irrelevant
incompetent
and
immaterial
if
this
were
not
a
legal
story
scraggs
had
been
one
of
these
but
he
had
also
been
one
of
those
who
drank
and
now
he
was
merely
a
bookkeeper
miss
wiggin
reigned
in
his
stead
a
woman
and
not
a
man
kept
tutt
tutt
on
the
map
when
this
sort
of
thing
occurs
it
is
usually
because
the
woman
in
question
is
the
ablest
and
very
likely
also
the
best
person
in
the
outfit
and
she
assumes
the
control
of
affairs
by
a
process
of
natural
selection
miss
wiggin
was
the
conscience
if
tutt
was
the
heart
of
tutt
tutt
nobody
unless
it
was
tutt
knew
where
she
had
come
from
or
why
she
was
working
if
at
all
in
only
a
law
office
without
her
something
dreadful
would
have
happened
to
the
general
morale
everybody
recognized
that
fact
her
very
appearance
gave
the
place
tone
neutralized
the
faint
odor
of
alcohol
from
the
cage
for
in
truth
she
was
a
woman
had
she
been
costumed
by
a
fifth
avenue
dressmaker
and
done
her
coiffure
differently
she
would
have
been
pretty
because
she
drew
her
gray
hair
straight
back
from
her
low
forehead
and
tied
it
in
a
knob
on
the
back
of
her
head
wore
paper
cuffs
and
a
black
dress
she
looked
nearer
fifty
than
which
she
was
two
hundred
dollars
would
have
taken
twenty
years
off
her
apparent
age
a
year
for
every
ten
dollars
but
she
would
not
have
looked
a
particle
less
a
lady
her
duties
were
ambiguous
she
was
always
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
office
and
was
the
only
person
permitted
to
open
the
firm
mail
outside
of
its
members
she
overlooked
the
books
that
scraggs
kept
and
sent
out
the
bills
she
kept
the
key
to
the
cash
box
and
had
charge
of
the
safe
she
made
the
entries
in
the
docket
and
performed
most
of
the
duties
of
a
regular
managing
clerk
she
had
been
admitted
to
the
bar
she
checked
up
the
charge
accounts
and
on
saturdays
paid
off
the
office
force
in
addition
to
all
these
things
she
occasionally
took
a
hand
at
a
brief
drew
most
of
the
pleadings
and
kept
track
of
everything
that
was
done
in
the
various
cases
but
her
chief
function
one
which
made
her
invaluable
was
that
of
receiving
clients
who
came
to
the
office
and
in
the
first
instance
ascertaining
just
what
their
troubles
were
and
she
was
so
sympathetic
and
at
the
same
time
so
sensible
that
many
a
stranger
who
casually
drifted
in
and
would
otherwise
just
as
casually
have
drifted
out
again
remained
a
permanent
fixture
in
the
firm
clientele
scraggs
and
william
adored
her
in
spite
of
her
being
an
utter
enigma
to
them
she
was
quiet
but
businesslike
of
few
words
but
with
a
latent
sense
of
humor
that
not
infrequently
broke
through
the
surface
of
her
gravity
and
she
proceeded
upon
the
excellent
postulate
that
everyone
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
was
actuated
by
the
highest
sense
of
honor
she
acted
as
a
spiritual
tonic
to
both
tutt
and
tutt
especially
to
the
latter
who
was
the
more
in
need
of
it
if
they
were
ever
tempted
to
stray
across
the
line
of
professional
rectitude
her
simple
assumption
that
the
thing
could
be
done
usually
settled
the
matter
once
and
for
all
on
delicate
questions
tutt
frankly
consulted
her
without
her
tutt
tutt
would
have
been
shysters
with
her
they
were
almost
respectable
she
received
a
salary
of
three
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
earned
double
that
amount
for
she
served
where
she
loved
and
her
first
thought
was
of
tutt
tutt
if
you
can
get
a
woman
like
that
to
run
your
law
office
do
not
waste
any
time
or
consideration
upon
a
man
her
price
is
indeed
above
rubies
yet
even
miss
wiggin
could
not
keep
the
shadow
of
the
vernal
equinox
off
the
simple
heart
of
the
junior
tutt
she
had
seen
it
coming
for
several
weeks
had
scented
danger
in
the
way
tutt
childish
eye
had
lingered
upon
miss
sondheim
tumultous
black
hair
and
in
the
rather
rakish
familiar
way
he
had
guided
the
ladies
who
came
to
get
divorces
out
to
the
elevator
and
then
there
swam
into
his
life
the
beautiful
allison
and
for
a
time
tutt
became
not
only
hysterically
young
again
but
well
you
shall
see
yet
curiously
enough
though
we
are
a
long
way
from
where
this
story
opened
it
all
goes
back
to
phillips
brooks
vanderbilt
and
the
fat
and
skinny
club
and
the
right
to
call
ourselves
by
what
names
we
please
moreover
as
must
be
apparent
all
that
happened
occurred
beyond
miss
wiggin
sphere
of
spiritual
influence
yet
had
it
not
even
she
could
not
have
harnessed
leviathan
or
loosed
the
bands
of

to
say
nothing
of
counteracting
the
effect
of

his

reddish
ornamented
with

in

protuberances
from

white

whirled
and
danced
in

a

highway

across

it

of

and
skinny
club

fancy
from
looking
at
sorg
that
that
is
quite
true
remarked
tutt
he
paused
and
reaching
down
into
a
lower
compartment
of
his
desk
lifted
out
a
tumbler
and
his
bottle
of
malt
extract
which
he
placed
carefully
at
his
elbow
and
leaned
back
again
contemplatively
look
here
tutt
he
said
i
want
to
ask
you
something
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
you
tutt
regarded
him
with
the
air
of
a
small
boy
caught
peeking
through
a
knot
hole
why
no
he
protested
lamely
that
is
nothing
in
particular
i
do
feel
a
bit
restless
sort
of
vaguely
dissatisfied
tutt
nodded
sympathetically
how
old
are
you
tutt
and
you
feel
just
at
present
as
if
life
were
stale
and
unprofitable
why
yes
you
might
put
it
that
way
the
fact
is
every
day
seems
just
like
every
other
day
i
do
even
get
any
pleasure
out
of
eating
the
very
sight
of
a
boiled
egg
beside
my
plate
at
breakfast

me
the
willies
i
ca

more
they
sicken

poured
out
a
glass
of
the
malt
extract
i
feel
the
same
way
about
a
lot
of
things
tutt
hurried
on
special
demurrers
for

they
bore
me
horribly
and
supplementary
proceedings
get
most
frightfully
upon
my
nerves
exactly
repeated
tutt
what
do
you
mean
by
snapped
tutt
you
bored
explained
his
partner
rather
agreed
tutt
bored
to
death
not
with
anything
special
you
understand
just
everything
i
feel
as
if
i
like
to
do
something
devilish
when
a
man
feels
like
that
he
better
go
to
a
doctor
declared
tutt
a
doctor
exclaimed
tutt
derisively
what
good
would
a
doctor
do
me
he
might
keep
you
from
getting
into

oh
you
need
be
alarmed
i
wo

of

married
men
to
do
the
most
surprising
things
round

looked
interested

you
now
he
inquired
well
i
no
doubt
it
did
some
of
a
world
of
good
tell
you
frankly
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
rather
like
to
take
a
bit
of
a
fling
myself
your
professional
experience
ought
to
be
enough
to
warn
you
of
the
dangers
of
that
sort
of
experiment
answered
tutt
gravely
bad
enough
when
it
occurs
inadvertently
so
to
speak
but
when
a
man
in
your
condition
of
life
deliberately
goes
out
to
invite
trouble
it
a
sad
sad
spectacle
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
i
not
able
to
take
care
of
myself
demanded
tutt
i
mean
to
imply
that
no
man
is
too
wise
to
be
made
a
fool
of
by
some
woman
that
every
samson
has
his
delilah
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way
yes
and
that
in
the
end
he
get
his
hair
cut
tutt
took
a
sip
from
the
tumbler
of
malt
and
relit
his
stogy
what
do
you
know
about
samson
and
delilah
tutt
he
challenged
oh
about
as
much
as
you
do
i
guess
tutt
answered
his
partner
modestly
well
who
cut
samson
hair
demanded
the
senior
member
he
emptied
the
dregs
of
the
bottle
into
his
glass
and
holding
it
to
the
light
examined
it
critically
delilah
of
course
ejaculated
tutt
tutt
shook
his
head
there
you
go
off
at
again
tutt
he
retorted
whimsically
you
wrong
her
she
did
no
such
thing
why
i
bet
you
a
hundred
dollars
on
it
cried
tutt
excitedly
make
it
a
simple
dinner
at
the
claridge
grill
and
i
go
you
done
there
were
four
books
on
the
desk
near
tutt
right
hand
the
new
york
code
of
civil
procedure
an
almanac
a
shakesperean
concordance
and
a
bible

it
up
for
yourself
said
tutt
waving
his
arm
with
a
gesture
of
the
utmost
impartiality
that
is
if
you
happen
to
know
in
what
part
of
holy
writ
said
delilah
is
to
be
found
tutt
followed
the
gesture
and
sat
down
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
desk
there
he
exclaimed
after
fumbling
over
the
leaves
for
several
minutes
what
did
i
tell
you
listen
tutt
it
in
the
sixteenth
chapter
of
judges
it
came
to
pass
when
she
pressed
him
daily
with
her
words
and
urged
him
so
that
his
soul
was
vexed
unto
death
that
he
told
her
all
his
heart
and
said
unto
her
there
hath
not
come
a
razor
upon
mine
head
um
um
read
on
tutt
ordered
tutt
um
when
delilah
saw
that
he
had
told
her
all
his
heart
she
sent
and
called
for
the
lords
of
the
philistines
saying
come
up
this
once
yes
go
on
she
made
him
sleep
upon
her
knees
and
she
called
for
a
man
and
she
caused
him
to
shave
off
the
seven
locks
of
his
head
well
i
be
hanged
exclaimed
tutt
now
i
would
have
staked
a
thousand
dollars
on
it
but
look
here
you
do
win
delilah
did
cut
samson
hair
through
her
agent
facit
per
alium
facit
per
se
your
point
is
overruled
said
tutt
a
barber
cut
samson
hair
let
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
never
to
take
anything
on
hearsay
always
look
up
your
authorities
yourself
moreover
and
he
looked
severely
at
tutt
the
cerebral
fluid
like
malt
extract
tends
to
become
cloudy
with
age
well
anyhow
i
no
samson
protested
tutt
and
i
have
met
anyone
that
looked
like
a
delilah
i
guess
after
the
procession
of
adventuresses
that
have
trailed
through
this
office
in
the
last
twenty
years
i
reasonably
safe
no
man
is
safe
meditated
tutt
for
the
reason
that
no
man
knows
the
power
of
expansion
of
his
heart
he
thinks
it
reached
its
limit
and
then
he
finds
to
his
horror
or
his
delight
that
it
has
to
put
it
another
way
a
man
capacity
to
love
may
be
likened
to
a
thermometer
at
or
thirty
he
meets
some
young
person
falls
in
love
with
her
thinks
his
amatory
thermometer
has
reached
the
and
accordingly
marries
her
in
point
of
fact
it
has
it
only
marking
summer
heat
has
even
registered
the
temperature
of
the
blood
well
he
goes
merrily
on
life
way
and
some
fine
day
another
lady
breezes
by
and
this
safe
and
sane
citizen
who
supposes
his
capacity
for
affection
was
reached
in
early
youth
suddenly
discovers
to
his
amazement
that
his
mercury
is
on
the
jump
and
presently
that
his
old
thermometer
has
blown
its
top
off
very
interesting
tutt
observed
tutt
after
a
moment
silence
you
seem
to
have
made
something
of
a
study
of
these
things
only
in
a
business
way
only
in
a
business
way
tutt
assured
him
now
if
you
feeling
stale
and
we
all
are
apt
to
get
that
way
this
time
of
year
why
do
you
take
a
run
down
to
atlantic
city
now
tutt
would
have
liked
to
go
to
atlantic
city
could
he
have
gone
by
himself
but
the
idea
of
taking
abigail
along
robbed
the
idea
of
its
attraction
she
had
got
more
than
ever
on
his
nerves
of
late
but
his
reply
whatever
it
might
have
been
was
interrupted
by
the
announcement
of
miss
wiggin
who
entered
at
that
moment
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
him
she
asked
for
tutt
explained
minerva
but
i
think
her
case
is
more
in
your
line
and
she
nodded
to
tutt
good
looking
inquired
tutt
roguishly
very
returned
miss
wiggin
a
blonde
thanks
answered
tutt
smoothing
his
hair
i
on
my
way
now
this
free
almost
vulgar
manner
of
speech
was
in
reality
foreign
to
both
tutt
and
miss
wiggin
and
it
was
born
of
the
instant
due
doubtless
to
some
peculiar
juxtaposition
of
astral
bodies
in
cupid
horoscope
unknown
to
them
but
which
none
the
less
had
its
influence
strange
things
happen
on
the
eve
of
agnes
and
on
midsummer
night
even
in
law
offices
allison
was
sitting
by
the
window
in
tutt
office
when
he
came
in
and
for
a
full
minute
he
paused
upon
the
threshold
while
she
pretended
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
there
the
deluge
of
sunlight
that
fell
upon
her
face
betrayed
no
crack
or
wrinkle
no
flaw
of
any
kind
in
the
white
marble
of
its
perfection
it
was
indeed
a
lovely
face
classic
in
the
chiseling
of
its
transparent
alabaster
and
when
she
turned
her
eyes
were
like
misty
lakes
of
blue
bar
none
she
was
the
most
beautiful
creature
and
there
had
been
many
that
had
ever
wandered
into
the
offices
of
tutt
tutt
he
sought
for
a
word
wonderful
that
was
it
she
was
wonderful
his
stale
spirit
soared
in
ecstasy
and
left
him
in
vulgar
parlance
he
was
rattled
to
death
this
commonplace
little
lawyer
who
for
a
score
of
years
had
dealt
cynically
with
the
loves
and
lives
of
the
flock
of
female
butterflies
who
fluttered
annually
in
and
out
of
the
office
throughout
that
period
he
had
sat
unemotionally
behind
his
desk
and
listened
in
an
aloof
cold
professional
manner
to
the
stories
of
their
wrongs
as
they
sobbed
or
hissed
them
forth
wise
little
lawyer
that
he
was
he
had
regarded
them
all
as
just
what
they
were
and
nothing
else
specimens
of
the
cecropia
and
he
had
not
even
patted
them
upon
the
shoulder
or
squeezed
their
hands
when
he
had
bade
them
maintaining
always
an
impersonal
and
dignified
demeanor
therefore
he
was
surprised
to
hear
himself
say
in
soothing
almost
cooing
tones
well
my
dear
what
can
i
do
for
you
shades
of
abigail
well
my
dear
tutt
tutt
tutt
i
am
in
great
trouble
faltered
allison
gazing
in
misty
helplessness
out
of
her
blue
grottoes
at
him
while
her
beautiful
red
lips
trembled
i
hope
i
can
help
you
he
breathed
tell
me
all
about
it
take
your
time
may
i
relieve
you
of
your
wrap
she
wriggled
out
of
it
gratefully
and
he
saw
for
the
first
time
the
round
slender
pillar
of
her
neck
what
a
head
she
had
in
its
nimbus
of
hazy
gold
what
a
figure
his
lawyer
heart
trembled
under
its
heavy
layer
of
dust
he
found
difficulty
in
articulating
he
stammered
staring
at
her
most
shamelessly
both
of
which
symptoms
she
did
not
notice
she
was
used
to
them
in
the
other
sex
tutt
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
had
in
fact
entered
upon
that
phase
at
which
the
wise
man
be
he
old
or
young
turns
and
runs
but
tutt
did
not
run
in
legal
phrase
he
stopped
looked
and
listened
experiencing
a
curious
feeling
of
expansion
this
enchanting
creature
transmuted
the
dingy
office
lined
with
its
rows
of
calfskin
bindings
into
a
golden
grot
in
which
he
stood
spellbound
by
the
low
murmur
of
her
voice
a
sense
of
infinite
leisure
emanated
from
her
a
subtle
denial
of
the
ordinary
responsibilities
very
relaxing
and
delightful
to
tutt
but
what
twitched
his
very
heartstrings
was
the
dimple
that
came
and
went
with
that
pathetic
little
twisted
smile
of
hers
i
came
to
you
said
allison
because
i
knew
you
were
both
kind
and
clever
tutt
smiled
sweetly
kind
perhaps
not
clever
he
beamed
why
everyone
says
you
are
one
of
the
cleverest
lawyers
in
new
york
she
protested
then
raising
her
innocent
eyes
to
his
she
murmured
and
i
so
need
kindness
tutt
breast
swelled
with
an
emotion
which
he
was
forced
to
admit
was
not
altogether
avuncular
that
curious
sentimental
mixture
that
men
feel
of
paternal
pity
platonic
tenderness
and
protectiveness
together
with
all
those
other
euphemistic
synonyms
that
make
them
eager
to
assist
the
weak
and
fragile
to
try
to
educate
and
elevate
and
particularly
to
find
out
just
how
weak
fragile
uneducated
and
unelevated
a
helpless
lady
may
be
but
in
spite
of
his
half
century
of
experience
tutt
knowledge
of
these
things
was
purely
vicarious
he
could
have
told
another
man
when
to
run
but
he
did
know
when
to
run
himself
he
could
have
saved
another
himself
he
could
not
save
at
any
rate
from
allison
he
had
never
seen
anyone
like
her
he
pulled
his
chair
a
little
nearer
she
was
so
slender
so
supple
so
what
was
it
svelte
and
she
had
an
air
of
childish
dignity
that
appealed
to
him
tremendously
there
was
nothing
he
assured
himself
of
the
vamp
about
her
at
all
i
only
want
to
get
my
rights
she
said
tremulously
i
nearly
out
of
my
mind
i
do
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
turn
is
there
he
forced
himself
to
utter
the
word
with
difficulty
a
a
man
involved
she
flushed
and
bowed
her
head
sadly
and
instantly
a
poignant
rage
possessed
him
a
man
i
trusted
absolutely
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
his
name
winthrop
oaklander
tutt
gasped
audibly
for
the
name
was
that
of
one
of
manhattan
most
distinguished
families
the
founder
of
which
had
swapped
glass
beads
and
shirts
with
the
aborigines
for
what
was
now
the
most
precious
water
frontage
in
the
world
and
moreover
allison
informed
tutt
he
was
a
clergyman
i
do
wonder
you
surprised
agreed
allison
why
i
i
not
surprised
at
all
prevaricated
tutt
at
the
same
time
groping
for
his
silk
handkerchief
you
do
mean
to
say
you
got
a
case
against
this
man
oaklander
i
have
indeed
she
retorted
with
firmly
compressed
lips
that
is
if
it
is
what
you
call
a
case
for
a
man
to
promise
to
marry
a
woman
and
then
in
the
end
refuse
to
do
so
of
course
it
is
answered
tutt
but
why
on
earth
would
he
he
found
out
i
had
been
divorced
she
explained
up
to
that
time
everything
had
been
lovely
you
see
he
thought
i
was
a
widow
ah
tutt
experienced
another
pang
of
resentment
against
mankind
in
general
i
had
a
leading
part
in
one
of
the
season
successes
on
broadway
she
continued
miserably
but
when
oaklander
promised
to
marry
me
i
left
the
stage
and
now
i
have
nothing
poor
child
sighed
tutt
he
would
have
liked
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
comfort
her
but
he
always
kept
the
door
into
the
outer
office
open
on
principle
you
know
oaklander
is
the
pastor
of
said
allison
i
thought
that
maybe
rather
than
have
any
publicity
he
might
do
a
little
something
for
me
i
suppose
you
got
something
in
the
way
of
evidence
have
you
letters
or
photographs
or
something
inquired
tutt
reverting
to
his
more
professional
manner
no
she
answered
we
never
wrote
to
one
another
and
when
we
went
out
it
was
usually
in
the
evening
i
do
suppose
half
a
dozen
people
have
ever
seen
us
together
that
awkward
meditated
tutt
if
he
denies
it
of
course
he
will
deny
it
you
ca
tell
he
may
not
oh
yes
he
will
why
he
even
refuses
to
admit
that
he
ever
met
me
declared
allison
indignantly
now
to
tutt
credit
be
it
said
that
neither
at
this
point
nor
at
any
other
did
any
suspicion
of
allison
sincerity
enter
his
mind
for
the
first
time
in
his
professional
existence
he
accepted
what
a
lady
client
told
him
at
its
face
value
indeed
he
felt
that
no
one
not
even
a
clergyman
could
help
loving
so
miraculous
a
woman
or
that
loving
her
one
could
refrain
from
marrying
her
save
for
some
religious
or
other
permanent
obstacle
he
was
sublimely
ecstatically
happy
in
the
mere
thought
that
he
tutt
might
be
of
help
to
such
a
celestial
being
and
he
desired
no
reward
other
than
the
privilege
of
being
her
willing
slave
and
of
reading
her
gratitude
in
those
melting
misty
eyes
allison
went
away
just
before
lunch
time
leaving
her
telephone
number
her
handkerchief
a
pungent
odor
of
violet
talc
and
a
disconsolate
but
highly
excited
tutt
never
at
any
rate
within
twenty
years
had
he
felt
so
young
life
seemed
tinged
with
every
color
of
the
spectrum
the
radiant
fact
was
that
he
would
he
simply
had
to
see
her
again
what
he
might
do
for
her
professionally
all
that
aspect
of
the
affair
was
shoved
far
into
the
background
of
his
mind
his
only
thought
was
how
to
get
her
back
into
his
office
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
shall
i
enter
the
lady
name
in
the
address
book
inquired
miss
wiggin
coldly
as
he
went
out
to
get
a
bite
of
lunch
tutt
hesitated
georgie
allison
is
her
name
he
said
in
a
detached
sort
of
way
address
tutt
felt
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
by
george
he
muttered
i
did
take
it
but
her
telephone
number
is
lincoln
square
to
chronicle
the
details
of
tutt
second
blooming
would
be
needlessly
to
derogate
from
the
dignity
of
the
history
of
tutt
tutt
there
is
a
silly
season
in
the
life
of
everyone
even
of
every
lawyer
who
can
call
himself
a
man
and
out
of
such
silliness
comes
the
gravity
of
knowledge
tutt
found
it
necessary
for
his
new
client
to
come
to
the
office
almost
every
day
and
as
she
usually
arrived
about
the
noon
hour
what
was
more
natural
than
that
he
should
invite
her
out
to
lunch
twice
he
walked
home
with
her
the
telephone
was
busy
constantly
and
the
only
thorn
in
the
rose
of
tutt
delirious
happiness
was
the
fear
lest
abigail
might
discover
something
the
thought
gave
him
many
an
anxious
hour
cost
him
several
sleepless
nights
at
times
this
nervousness
about
his
wife
almost
exceeded
the
delight
of
having
allison
for
a
friend
yet
each
day
he
became
on
more
and
more
cordial
terms
with
her
and
the
lunches
became
longer
and
more
intimate
the
reverend
winthrop
oaklander
gave
no
sign
of
life
however
the
customary
barrage
of
legal
letters
had
been
laid
down
but
without
eliciting
any
response
the
reverend
winthrop
must
be
a
wise
one
opined
tutt
and
he
began
to
have
a
hearty
contempt
as
well
as
hatred
for
his
quarry
the
first
letter
had
been
the
usual
vague
hint
that
the
clergyman
might
and
probably
would
find
it
to
his
advantage
to
call
at
the
offices
of
tutt
tutt
and
so
on
the
reverend
winthrop
however
did
not
seem
to
care
to
secure
said
advantage
whatever
it
might
be
the
second
epistle
gave
the
name
of
the
client
and
proposed
a
friendly
discussion
of
her
affairs
no
reply
the
third
hinted
at
legal
proceedings
total
silence
the
fourth
demanded
ten
thousand
dollars
damages
and
threatened
immediate
suit
in
answer
to
this
last
appeared
the
reverend
winthrop
himself
he
was
a
young
chap
with
a
clear
eye
almost
as
blue
as
georgie
and
a
skin
even
pinker
than
hers
and
he
stood
six
feet
five
in
his
oxfords
and
his
fist
looked
to
tutt
as
big
as
a
coconut
are
you
the
blackmailer
who
been
writing
me
those
letters
he
demanded
springing
into
tutt
office
if
you
are
let
me
tell
you
something
you
got
hold
of
the
wrong
monkey
i
been
dealing
with
fellows
of
your
variety
ever
since
i
got
out
of
the
seminary
i
know
the
lady
you
pretend
to
represent
and
i
never
heard
of
her
if
i
get
any
more
letters
from
you
i
go
down
and
lay
the
case
before
the
district
attorney
and
if
he
does
put
you
in
jail
i
come
up
here
and
knock
your
head
off
understand
good
day
at
any
other
period
in
his
existence
tutt
could
not
have
failed
to
be
impressed
with
the
honesty
of
this
husky
exponent
of
the
church
militant
but
he
was
drugged
as
by
the
drowsy
mandragora
the
blatant
defiance
of
this
muscular
preacher
outraged
him
this
canting
hypocrite
this
wolf
in
priest
clothing
must
be
brought
to
book
but
how
allison
had
admitted
the
literal
truth
when
she
had
told
him
that
there
were
no
letters
no
photographs
there
was
no
use
commencing
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
if
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
it
and
once
the
papers
were
filed
their
bolt
would
have
been
shot
some
way
must
be
devised
whereby
the
reverend
winthrop
oaklander
could
be
made
to
perceive
that
tutt
tutt
meant
business
and
equally
imperative
whereby
georgie
would
be
impressed
with
the
fact
that
not
for
nothing
had
she
come
to
them
that
is
to
him
for
help
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
the
whole
thing
had
become
rather
hysterical
tutt
though
having
nothing
seriously
to
reproach
himself
with
was
constantly
haunted
by
a
sense
of
being
rather
ridiculous
and
doing
something
behind
his
wife
back
he
told
himself
that
his
platonic
regard
for
georgie
was
a
noble
thing
and
did
him
honor
but
it
was
an
honor
which
he
preferred
to
wear
as
an
entirely
private
decoration
he
was
conscious
of
being
laughed
at
by
willie
and
scraggs
and
disapproved
of
by
miss
wiggin
who
was
very
snippy
to
him
and
in
addition
there
was
the
omnipresent
horror
of
having
abigail
unearth
his
philandering
he
now
not
only
thought
of
allison
as
georgie
but
addressed
her
thus
and
there
was
quite
a
tidy
little
bill
at
the
florist
for
flowers
that
he
had
sent
her
in
one
respect
only
did
he
exhibit
even
the
most
elementary
caution
he
wrote
and
signed
all
his
letters
to
her
himself
upon
the
typewriter
and
filed
copies
in
the
safe
so
there
we
are
he
sighed
as
he
gave
to
allison
a
somewhat
expurgated
or
rather
emasculated
version
of
the
reverend
visit
we
have
got
to
hand
him
something
hot
or
make
up
our
minds
to
surrender
in
a
word
we
have
got
to
scare
him
georgie
and
then
it
was
that
like
the
apocryphal
mosquito
the
fat
and
skinny
club
justified
its
attempted
existence
for
the
indefatigable
sorg
made
an
unheralded
reappearance
in
the
outer
office
and
insisted
upon
seeing
tutt
loudly
asserting
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
if
a
new
application
were
now
made
to
another
judge
whom
he
knew
it
would
be
more
favorably
received
tutt
went
to
the
doorway
and
stood
there
barring
the
entrance
and
expostulating
with
him
all
right
shouted
sorg
all
right
i
hear
you
but
do
tell
me
that
a
man
named
solomon
swackhamer
can
change
his
name
to
phillips
brooks
vanderbilt
and
in
the
same
breath
a
reputable
body
of
citizens
be
denied
the
right
to
call
themselves
what
they
please
he
do
understand
explained
tutt
to
georgie
who
had
listened
with
wide
dreamy
eyes
he
do
appreciate
the
difference
between
doing
a
thing
as
an
individual
and
as
a
group
what
thing
why
taking
a
name
i
do
get
you
said
georgie
sorg
wanted
to
call
his
crowd
the
fat
and
skinny
club
and
the
court
would
let
him
thought
it
was
silly
well
but
he
could
have
called
himself
mr
fat
or
mr
skinny
or
mr
anything
else
without
having
to
ask
anybody
oh
i
say
tutt
had
stiffened
into
sculpture
what
is
it
demanded
georgie
fascinated
i
got
an
idea
he
cried
you
can
call
yourself
anything
you
like
why
not
call
yourself
winthrop
oaklander
but
what
good
would
that
do
she
asked
vaguely
look
here
directed
tutt
this
is
the
surest
thing
you
know
just
go
up
to
the
biltmore
and
register
as
winthrop
oaklander
you
have
a
perfect
legal
right
to
do
it
you
could
call
yourself
julius
caesar
if
you
wanted
to
take
a
room
and
stay
there
until
our
young
christian
soldier
offers
you
a
suitable
inducement
to
move
along
even
if
violating
the
law
somehow
his
first
attempt
to
make
trouble
for
you
will
bring
about
the
very
publicity
he
is
anxious
to
avoid
why
marvelous
and
absolutely
safe
they
ca
touch
you
he
come
across
inside
of
two
hours
if
he
does
a
word
to
the
reporters
will
start
things
in
the
right
direction
for
a
moment
allison
looked
puzzled
then
her
beautiful
face
broke
into
an
enthusiastic
classic
smile
and
she
laid
her
little
hand
softly
on
his
arm
what
a
clever
boy
you
are
sammy
a
subdued
snigger
came
from
the
direction
of
the
desk
usually
occupied
by
william
tutt
flushed
it
was
one
thing
to
call
allison
georgie
in
private
and
another
to
have
her
sammy
him
within
hearing
of
the
office
force
and
just
then
miss
wiggin
passed
by
with
her
nose
slightly
in
the
air
what
a
perfectly
wonderful
idea
went
on
allison
rapturously
a
perfectly
wonderful
idea
then
she
smiled
a
strange
mysterious
significant
smile
that
almost
tore
tutt
heart
out
by
the
roots
listen
sammy
she
whispered
with
a
new
light
in
those
beautiful
eyes
i
want
five
thousand
dollars
five
repeated
tutt
simply
i
thought
you
wanted
ten
thousand
only
five
from
you
sammy
me
he
gagged
you
dearest
tutt
turned
blazing
hot
then
cold
dizzy
and
his
sight
was
slightly
blurred
slowly
he
groped
for
the
door
and
closed
it
cautiously
what
are
you
talking
about
he
choked
though
he
knew
perfectly
well
georgie
had
thrown
herself
back
in
the
leather
chair
by
his
desk
and
had
opened
her
gold
about
five
thousand
dollars
she
replied
with
the
careful
enunciation
of
a
new
england
what
five
thousand
dollars
the
five
you
going
to
hand
me
before
i
leave
this
office
sammy
darling
she
retorted
dazzlingly
tutt
head
swam
and
he
sank
weakly
into
his
swivel
chair
it
was
incredible
that
he
a
veteran
of
the
criminal
bar
should
have
been
so
tricked
instantly
as
when
a
reagent
is
injected
into
a
retort
of
chemicals
and
a
precipitate
is
formed
leaving
the
previously
cloudy
liquid
like
crystal
tutt
addled
brain
cleared
he
was
caught
the
victim
of
his
own
asininity
he
dared
not
look
at
this
woman
who
had
wound
him
thus
round
her
finger
innocent
as
he
was
of
any
wrongdoing
he
was
ashamed
to
think
of
his
wife
my
lord
he
murmured
realizing
for
the
first
time
the
depth
of
his
weakness
oh
it
is
as
bad
as
that
she
laughed
remember
you
were
going
to
charge
oaklander
ten
thousand
this
costs
you
only
five
special
rates
for
physicians
and
lawyers
and
suppose
i
do
choose
to
give
it
to
you
he
asked
listen
here
you
funny
little
man
she
answered
in
caressing
tones
that
made
him
writhe
you
stand
for
twenty
if
i
insisted
on
it
oh
do
jump
i
not
going
to
you
getting
off
easy
too
easy
but
i
want
to
stay
on
good
terms
with
you
i
may
need
you
sometime
in
my
business
your
certified
check
for
five
thousand
dollars
and
i
leave
you
she
struck
a
match
and
started
to
light
a
tiny
cigarette
do
he
gasped
not
in
the
office
do
i
get
the
five
thousand
he
ground
his
teeth
not
yet
willing
to
concede
defeat
you
silly
old
bird
she
said
do
you
know
how
many
times
you
had
me
down
here
in
your
office
in
the
last
three
weeks
fifteen
how
many
times
you
taken
me
out
to
lunch
ten
how
often
you
called
me
on
the
telephone
how
many
times
you
sent
me
flowers
twelve
how
many
letters
you
written
me
eleven
oh
i
realize
they
typewritten
but
a
photograph
enlargement
would
show
they
were
typed
in
your
office
every
typewriter
has
its
own
individuality
you
know
your
clerks
and
office
boy
have
heard
me
call
you
sammy
why
every
time
you
moved
with
me
beside
you
someone
has
seen
you
enough
is
it
but
now
on
top
of
all
that
you
go
and
hand
me
exactly
what
i
need
on
a
gold
plate
he
gazed
at
her
stupidly
why
if
now
you
do
give
me
that
check
i
shall
simply
go
up
to
the
biltmore
and
register
as
samuel
tutt
i
shall
take
a
room
and
stay
there
until
you
offer
me
a
proper
inducement
to
move
on
she
giggled
delightedly
it
marvelous
absolutely
safe
she
quoted
they
touch
me
you
come
across
inside
of
two
hours
if
you
do
a
word
to
the
reporters
will
start
things
in
the
right
direction
do
he
groaned
i
must
have
been
crazy
that
was
simply
blackmail
that
exactly
what
it
was
she
agreed
there
are
any
letters
except
these
typewritten
ones
or
photographs
or
any
evidence
at
all
but
you
going
to
give
me
five
thousand
dollars
just
the
same
just
so
that
your
wife
wo
know
what
a
silly
old
fool
you
been
your
check
book
sam
tutt
pulled
out
the
bottom
drawer
of
his
desk
and
slowly
removed
his
personal
check
book
with
his
fountain
pen
in
his
hand
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
rather
than
give
you
another
cent
i
stand
the
gaff
he
remarked
defiantly
i
know
it
she
answered
i
looked
you
up
before
i
came
here
the
first
time
you
are
good
for
exactly
five
thousand
dollars
tutt
filled
out
the
check
to
cash
and
sent
willie
across
the
street
to
the
bank
to
have
it
certified
the
sun
was
just
sinking
over
the
jersey
shore
beyond
the
statue
of
liberty
and
the
surface
of
the
harbor
undulated
like
iridescent
watered
silk
the
clouds
were
torn
into
rents
and
the
air
was
so
clear
that
one
could
look
down
the
narrows
far
out
to
the
open
sea
standing
there
by
the
window
allison
looked
as
innocently
beautiful
as
the
day
tutt
had
first
beheld
her
after
all
he
thought
perhaps
the
experience
had
been
worth
the
money
something
of
the
same
thought
may
have
occurred
to
the
lady
for
as
she
took
the
check
and
carefully
examined
the
certification
she
remarked
with
a
distinct
access
of
cordiality
really
sammy
you
quite
a
nice
little
man
i
rather
like
you
tutt
stood
after
she
had
gone
watching
the
sunset
until
the
west
was
only
a
mass
of
leaden
shadows
then
strangely
relieved
he
took
his
hat
and
started
out
of
the
office
somewhat
to
his
surprise
he
found
miss
wiggin
still
at
her
desk
by
the
way
she
remarked
casually
as
he
passed
her
what
shall
i
charge
that
check
to
the
one
you
just
drew
to
cash
for
five
thousand
dollars
charge
it
to
life
insurance
he
said
shortly
he
felt
almost
gay
as
he
threaded
his
way
through
the
crowds
along
broadway
somehow
a
tremendous
load
had
been
lifted
from
his
shoulders
he
would
no
longer
be
obliged
to
lead
a
sneaking
surreptitious
existence
he
felt
like
shouting
with
joy
now
that
he
could
look
the
world
frankly
in
the
face
the
genuine
agony
he
had
endured
during
the
past
three
weeks
loomed
like
a
sickness
behind
him
he
had
been
a
fool
and
there
was
no
fool
like
an
old
one
just
let
him
get
back
to
his
old
abigail
and
there
be
no
more
business
for
him
abigail
might
not
have
the
figure
or
the
complexion
that
georgie
had
but
she
was
a
darn
sight
more
reliable
henceforth
she
could
have
him
from
five
to
nine
without
reserve
as
for
kicking
over
the
traces
sowing
wild
oats
and
that
sort
of
thing
there
was
nothing
in
it
for
him
give
him
friend
wife
he
stopped
at
the
florist
and
having
paid
a
bill
of
dollars
for
georgie
flowers
purchased
a
double
bunch
of
violets
and
carried
them
home
with
him
abigail
was
watching
for
him
out
of
the
window
something
warm
rushed
to
his
heart
at
the
sight
of
her
through
the
lace
curtains
she
looked
quite
trim
hello
old
girl
he
cried
as
she
opened
the
door
waiting
for
me
eh
here
a
bunch
of
posies
for
you
and
he
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
that
more
than
i
ever
did
to
georgie
he
said
to
himself
why
samuel
laughed
abigail
with
a
faded
blush
what
ever
got
into
you
dunno
he
retorted
gaily
the
spring
i
guess
what
do
you
say
to
a
little
dinner
at
a
restaurant
and
then
going
to
the
play
she
bridled
being
one
of
the
generation
who
did
such
things
with
pleasure
seems
to
me
you
getting
rather
extravagant
she
objected
still
oh
come
along
he
bullied
her
one
of
my
clients
collected
five
thousand
dollars
this
afternoon
tutt
summoned
a
taxi
and
they
drove
to
the
brightest
most
glittering
of

hostelries
abigail
had
never
been
in
such
a
chic
place
before
it
half
terrified
and
shocked
her
all
those
women
in
dresses
that
hardly
came
up
to
their
armpits
some
of
them
were
handsome
though
that
slim
one
at
the
table
by
the
pillar
for
instance
she
was
really
quite
lovely
with
that
mass
of
hair
that
startlingly
white
skin
and
those
misty
eyes
and
the
gentleman
with
her
the
tall
man
with
the
pink
cheeks
was
very
handsome
too
look
samuel
she
said
touching
his
hand
see
that
couple
over
there
but
samuel
was
looking
at
them
already
intently
and
just
then
the
beautiful
woman
turned
and
catching
sight
of
the
tutts
smiled
cordially
if
somewhat
roguishly
and
raised
her
glass
as
did
her
companion
mechanically
tutt
elevated
his
the
three
drank
to
one
another
do
you
know
those
people
samuel
inquired
tutt
somewhat
stiffly
who
are
they
oh
those
over
there
he
repeated
absently
i
do
really
know
what
the
lady
name
is
she
been
down
to
our
office
a
few
times
but
the
man
is
winthrop
oaklander
and
the
funny
part
of
it
is
i
always
thought
he
was
a
clergyman
later
in
the
evening
he
turned
to
her
between
the
acts
and
remarked
inconsequently
say
abbie
do
i
look
as
if
i
just
had
my
hair
cut
the
dog
andrew
every
dog
is
entitled
to
one
bite
unreported
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
york
supreme
court
now
see
here
shouted
appleboy
coming
out
of
the
boathouse
where
he
was
cleaning
his
morning
catch
of
perch
as
his
neighbor
tunnygate
crashed
through
the
hedge
and
cut
across
appleboy
parched
lawn
to
the
beach
see
here
tunnygate
i
wo
have
you
trespassing
on
my
place
i
told
you
so
at
least
a
dozen
times
look
at
the
hole
you
made
in
that
hedge
now
why
ca
you
stay
in
the
path
his
ordinarily
countenance
was
suffused
with
anger
and
perspiration
his
irritation
with
tunnygate
had
reached
the
point
of
explosion
tunnygate
was
a
thankless
friend
and
he
was
a
great
cross
to
appleboy
aforetime
the
two
had
been
intimate
in
the
fraternal
taciturn
intimacy
characteristic
of
fat
men
an
attraction
perhaps
akin
to
that
exerted
for
one
another
by
celestial
bodies
of
great
mass
for
it
is
a
fact
that
stout
people
do
gravitate
toward
one
another
and
hang
or
float
in
placid
juxtaposition
perhaps
merely
as
a
physical
result
of
their
avoirdupois
so
appleboy
and
tunnygate
had
swum
into
each
spheres
of
influence
either
blown
by
the
dallying
winds
of
chance
or
drawn
by
some
mysterious
animal
magnetism
and
being
both
addicted
to
the
delights
of
the
soporific
sport
sanctified
by
izaak
walton
had
raised
unto
themselves
portable
temples
upon
the
shores
of
long
island
sound
in
that
part
of
the
geographical
limits
of
the
greater
city
known
as
throggs
neck
every
morn
during
the
heat
of
the
summer
months
appleboy
would
rouse
tunnygate
or
conversely
tunnygate
would
rouse
appleboy
and
each
in
his
own
wobbly
skiff
would
row
out
to
the
spot
which
seemed
most
propitious
to
the
piscatorial
art
there
under
two
green
umbrellas
like
two
fat
rajahs
in
their
shaking
howdahs
upon
the
backs
of
two
white
elephants
the
friends
would
sit
in
solemn
equanimity
awaiting
the
evasive
cunner
the
vagrant
perch
or
cod
or
the
occasional
flirtatious
eel
they
rarely
spoke
and
when
they
did
the
edifice
of
their
conversation
their
tower
of
babel
so
to
speak
was
monosyllabic
thus
huh
ai
had
a
bite
huh
huh
silence
for
forty
minutes
then
huh
had
a
bite
nope
huh
that
was
generally
the
sum
total
of
their
interchange
yet
it
satisfied
them
for
their
souls
were
in
harmony
to
them
it
was
pregnant
of
unutterable
meanings
of
philosophic
mysteries
more
subtle
than
those
of
the
esoterics
of
flowers
and
poetry
of
and
twilight
of
all
the
nuances
of
softly
whispered
avowals
of
the
elusive
harmonies
of
love
ecstasy
huh
huh
and
then
into
this
eden
only
not
by
virtue
of
the
excision
of
any
vertebra
such
as
was
originally
necessary
in
the
case
of
adam
burst
woman
there
was
silence
no
longer
the
air
was
rent
with
clamor
for
both
appleboy
and
tunnygate
within
a
month
of
one
another
took
unto
themselves
wives
wives
after
their
own
image
for
a
while
things
went
well
enough
it
takes
ladies
a
few
weeks
to
find
out
each
other
weak
points
but
then
the
new
tunnygate
unexpectedly
yet
undeniably
began
to
exhibit
the
serpent
tooth
the
adder
tongue
or
the
cloven
hoof
as
the
reader
literary
traditions
may
lead
him
to
prefer
for
no
obvious
reason
at
all
she
conceived
a
violent
hatred
of
appleboy
a
hatred
that
waxed
all
the
more
virulent
on
account
of
its
object
innocently
obstinate
refusal
to
comprehend
or
recognize
it
indeed
tunnygate
found
it
so
difficult
to
rouse
appleboy
into
a
state
of
belligerency
sufficiently
interesting
that
she
soon
transferred
her
energies
to
the
more
worthy
task
of
making
appleboy
life
a
burden
to
him
to
this
end
she
devoted
herself
with
a
truly
machiavellian
ingenuity
devising
all
sorts
of
insults
irritations
and
annoyances
and
adding
to
the
venom
of
her
tongue
the
inventive
cunning
of
a
malayan
witch
doctor
the
appleboys
mysteriously
fell
off
the
piazza
their
disappeared
their
milk
bottles
vanished
appleboy
fish
lines
acquired
a
habit
of
derangement
equaled
only
by
entanglements
and
his
clams
went
bad
but
these
things
might
have
been
borne
had
it
not
been
for
the
crowning
achievement
of
her
malevolence
the
invasion
of
the
appleboys
cherished
lawn
upon
which
they
lavished
all
that
anxious
tenderness
which
otherwise
they
might
have
devoted
to
a
child
it
was
only
about
twenty
feet
by
twenty
and
it
was
bordered
by
a
hedge
of
privet
but
anyone
who
has
ever
attempted
to
induce
a
blade
of
grass
to
grow
upon
a
sand
dune
will
fully
appreciate
the
deviltry
of
tunnygate
malignant
mind
already
there
was
a
horrid
rent
where
tunnygate
had
floundered
through
at
her
suggestion
in
order
to
save
going
round
the
pathetic
grass
plot
which
the
appleboys
had
struggled
to
create
where
nature
had
obviously
intended
a
floral
vacuum
undoubtedly
it
had
been
the
sight
of
appleboy
with
her
small
watering
pot
patiently
encouraging
the
recalcitrant
blades
that
had
suggested
the
malicious
thought
to
tunnygate
that
maybe
the
appleboys
did
own
that
far
up
the
beach
they
did
that
was
the
mockery
of
it
like
many
others
they
had
built
their
porch
on
their
boundary
line
and
as
tunnygate
pointed
out
they
were
claiming
to
own
something
that
was
theirs
so
tunnygate
in
daily
obedience
to
his
spouse
forced
his
way
through
the
hedge
to
the
beach
and
daily
the
wrath
of
the
appleboys
grew
until
they
were
driven
almost
to
desperation
now
when
the
two
former
friends
sat
fishing
in
their
skiffs
they
either
contemptuously
ignored
one
another
or
if
they
at
all
the
huhs
resembled
the
angry
growls
of
infuriated
beasts
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
appleboys
could
properly
do
anything
about
it
tunnygate
had
as
tunnygate
sneeringly
pointed
out
a
perfect
legal
right
to
push
his
way
through
the
hedge
and
tramp
across
the
lawn
and
she
propose
to
allow
the
appleboys
to
gain
any
rights
by
proscription
either
not
much
therefore
when
appleboy
addressed
to
tunnygate
the
remarks
with
which
this
story
opens
the
latter
insolently
replied
in
words
form
or
substance
that
appleboy
could
go
to
hell
moreover
as
he
went
by
appleboy
he
took
pains
to
kick
over
a
clod
of
transplanted
sea
grass
nurtured
by
appleboy
as
the
darling
of
her
bosom
and
designed
to
give
an
air
of
verisimilitude
to
an
otherwise
bare
and
unconvincing
surface
of
sand
appleboy
almost
cried
with
vexation
oh
he
ejaculated
struggling
for
words
to
express
the
full
content
of
his
feeling
gosh
but
you
mean
he
hit
it
curiously
enough
that
was
exactly
the
word
tunnygate
was
mean
and
his
meanness
was
second
only
to
that
of
the
fat
hippopotama
his
wife
then
without
knowing
why
for
he
had
no
formulated
ideas
as
to
the
future
and
probably
only
intended
to
try
to
scare
tunnygate
with
vague
threats
appleboy
added
i
warn
you
not
to
go
through
that
hedge
again
understand
i
warn
you
and
if
you
do
i
wo
be
responsible
for
the
consequences
he
really
did
mean
a
thing
by
the
words
and
tunnygate
knew
it
huh
retorted
the
latter
contemptuously
you
appleboy
went
inside
the
shack
and
banged
the
door
appleboy
was
peeling
potatoes
in
the
room
i
ca
stand
it
he
cried
weakly
he
driving
me
wild
poor
lamb
soothed
appleboy
peeling
an
interminable
rind
that
just
a
sweetie
look
it
most
as
long
as
your
arm
she
held
it
up
dangling
between
her
thumb
and
then
with
a
groan
she
dropped
it
at
his
feet
i
know
it
a
real
burden
to
you
deary
she
sighed
suddenly
they
both
bent
forward
with
startled
eyes
hypnotized
by
the
peel
upon
the
floor
unmistakably
it
spelt
dog
they
looked
at
one
another
significantly
it
is
a
symbol
breathed
appleboy
in
an
awed
whisper
whatever
it
is
it
some
grand
idea
exclaimed
her
husband
do
you
know
anybody
who
got
one
i
mean
a
a
i
know
just
what
you
mean
she
agreed
i
wonder
we
never
thought
of
it
before
but
there
would
be
any
use
in
getting
any
dog
oh
no
he
concurred
we
want
a
real
dog
one
you
know
about
she
commented
the
fact
is
said
he
rubbing
his
forehead
if
they
know
about
they
do
something
to
it
ai
so
easy
to
get
the
right
kind
oh
we
get
one
she
encouraged
him
now
aunt
eliza
up
to
livornia
used
to
have
one
it
made
a
lot
of
trouble
and
they
ordered
her
the
selectmen
did
to
do
away
with
it
but
she
only
pretended
she
had
she
did
really
and
i
think
she
got
him
yet
gee
said
appleboy
tensely
what
sort
was
it
a
bull
she
replied
with
a
big
white
face
that
the
kind
he
agreed
excitedly
what
was
its
name
andrew
she
answered
that
a
queer
name
for
a
dog
he
commented
still
i
do
care
what
his
name
is
so
long
as
he
the
right
kind
of
dog
why
do
you
write
to
aunt
eliza
of
course
andrew
may
be
dead
she
hazarded
dogs
do
die
oh
i
guess
andrew
is
dead
he
said
hopefully
that
tough
kind
of
dog
lasts
a
long
time
what
will
you
say
to
aunt
eliza
appleboy
went
to
the
dresser
and
took
a
pad
and
pencil
from
one
of
the
shelves
oh
something
like
this
she
answered
poising
the
pencil
over
the
pad
in
her
lap
dear
aunt
eliza
i
hope
you
are
quite
well
it
is
sort
of
lonely
living
down
here
on
the
beach
and
there
are
a
good
many
rough
characters
so
we
are
looking
for
a
dog
for
companionship
and
protection
almost
any
kind
of
healthy
dog
would
do
and
you
may
be
sure
he
would
have
a
good
home
hoping
to
see
you
soon
your
affectionate
niece
bashemath
i
hope
she
send
us
andrew
said
appleboy
fervently
i
guess
she
will
nodded
bashemath
what
on
earth
is
that
sign
wrathfully
demanded
tunnygate
one
morning
about
a
week
later
as
she
looked
across
the
appleboys
lawn
from
her
kitchen
window
can
you
read
it
herman
herman
stopped
trying
to
adjust
his
collar
and
went
out
on
the
piazza
something
about
he
declared
finally
dog
she
exclaimed
they
have
got
a
dog
well
he
remarked
that
what
the
sign
says
of
the
dog
and
there
something
above
it
oh
crossing
this
property
trespassing
forbidden
what
impudence
avowed
tunnygate
did
you
ever
know
such
people
first
they
try
and
take
land
that
do
belong
to
them
and
then
they
go
and
lie
about
having
a
dog
where
are
they
anyway
i
have
seen
this
morning
he
answered
maybe
they
gone
away
and
put
up
the
sign
so
we
wo
go
over
think
that
stop
us
in
that
case
they
got
another
think
comin
she
retorted
angrily
i
a
good
mind
to
have
you
go
over
and
tear
up
the
whole
place
pull
up
the
hedge
he
concurred
eagerly
good
chance
indeed
to
tunnygate
it
seemed
the
supreme
opportunity
both
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
eyes
of
his
blushing
bride
and
to
gratify
that
perverse
instinct
inherited
from
our
ancestors
to
destroy
utterly
in
order
perhaps
that
they
may
never
seek
to
avenge
themselves
upon
us
those
whom
we
have
wronged
accordingly
tunnygate
girded
himself
with
his
suspenders
and
with
a
gleam
of
fiendish
exultation
in
his
eye
stealthily
descended
from
his
porch
and
crossed
to
the
hole
in
the
hedge
no
one
was
in
sight
except
two
barefooted
searchers
after
clams
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
up
the
beach
and
a
man
working
in
a
field
half
a
mile
away
the
bay
shimmered
in
the
broiling
august
sun
and
from
a
distant
grove
came
the
rattle
and
wheeze
of
locusts
throggs
neck
blazed
in
silence
and
utterly
silent
was
the
house
of
appleboy
with
an
air
of
bravado
but
with
a
slightly
accelerated
heartbeat
tunnygate
thrust
himself
through
the
hole
in
the
hedge
and
looked
scornfully
about
the
appleboy
lawn
a
fierce
rage
worked
through
his
veins
a
lawn
what
effrontery
what
business
had
these
condescending
to
presume
to
improve
a
perfectly
good
beach
which
was
satisfactory
to
other
folks
he
show
he
took
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
transplanted
sea
grass
unexpectedly
the
door
of
the
appleboy
kitchen
opened
i
warned
you
enunciated
appleboy
with
unnatural
calmness
which
with
another
background
might
have
struck
almost
anybody
as
suspicious
huh
returned
the
startled
tunnygate
forced
under
the
circumstances
to
assume
a
nonchalance
that
he
did
not
altogether
feel
you
well
repeated
appleboy
do
ever
say
i
did
pshaw
ejaculated
tunnygate
disdainfully
with
premeditation
and
deliberation
and
with
undeniable
malice
aforethought
he
kicked
the
nearest
bunch
of
sea
grass
several
feet
in
the
air
his
violence
carried
his
leg
high
in
the
air
and
he
partially
lost
his
equilibrium
simultaneously
a
white
streak
shot
from
beneath
the
porch
and
something
like
a
poker
thrust
itself
savagely
into
an
extremely
tender
part
of
his
anatomy
ouch
o
o
oh
he
yelled
in
agony
oh
come
here
andrew
said
appleboy
mildly
good
doggy
come
here
but
andrew
paid
no
attention
he
had
firmly
affixed
himself
to
the
base
of
tunnygate
personality
without
any
intention
of
being
immediately
detached
and
he
had
selected
that
place
taken
aim
and
discharged
himself
with
an
air
of
confidence
and
skill
begotten
of
lifelong
experience
oh
o
o
oh
screamed
tunnygate
turning
wildly
and
clawing
through
the
hedge
dragging
andrew
after
him
oh
o
oh
tunnygate
rushed
to
the
door
in
time
to
see
her
spouse
lumbering
up
the
beach
with
a
white
object
gyrating
in
the
air
behind
him
what
the
matter
she
called
out
languidly
then
perceiving
the
matter
she
hastily
followed
the
appleboys
were
standing
on
their
lawn
viewing
the
whole
proceeding
with
ostentatious
indifference
up
the
beach
fled
tunnygate
his
cries
becoming
fainter
and
fainter
the
two
clam
diggers
watched
him
curiously
but
made
no
attempt
to
go
to
his
assistance
the
man
in
the
field
leaned
luxuriously
upon
his
hoe
and
surrendered
himself
to
unalloyed
delight
tunnygate
was
now
but
a
white
flicker
against
the
distant
sand
his
wails
had
a
dying
fall
o
o
oh
well
we
warned
him
remarked
appleboy
to
bashemath
with
a
smile
in
which
however
lurked
a
slight
trace
of
apprehension
we
certainly
did
she
replied
then
after
a
moment
she
added
a
trifle
anxiously
i
wonder
what
will
happen
to
andrew
tunnygate
did
not
return
neither
did
andrew
secluded
in
their
kitchen
the
appleboys
heard
a
motor
arrive
and
through
a
crack
in
the
door
saw
it
carry
tunnygate
away
bedecked
as
for
some
momentous
ceremonial
at
four
while
appleboy
was
digging
bait
he
observed
another
motor
making
its
wriggly
way
along
the
dunes
it
was
fitted
longitudinally
with
seats
had
a
wire
grating
and
was
marked
two
policemen
in
uniform
sat
in
front
instinctively
appleboy
realized
that
the
gods
had
called
him
his
heart
sank
among
the
clams
slowly
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
lawn
where
the
wagon
had
stopped
outside
the
hedge
hey
there
called
out
the
driver
is
your
name
appleboy
appleboy
nodded
put
your
coat
on
then
and
come
along
directed
the
other
i
got
a
warrant
for
you
warrant
stammered
appleboy
dizzily
what
that
cried
bashemath
appearing
at
the
door
warrant
for
what
the
officer
slowly
descended
and
handed
appleboy
a
paper
for
assault
he
replied
i
guess
you
know
what
for
all
right
we
have
assaulted
anybody
protested
appleboy
heatedly
andrew
you
can
explain
all
that
to
the
judge
retorted
the
cop
meantime
put
on
your
duds
and
climb
in
if
you
do
expect
to
spend
the
night
at
the
station
you
better
bring
along
the
deed
of
your
house
so
you
can
give
bail
but
who
the
warrant
for
persisted
appleboy
for
enoch
appleboy
retorted
the
cop
wearily
ca
you
read
but
enoch
did
do
a
thing
she
declared
it
was
andrew
who
andrew
inquired
the
officer
of
the
law
mistrustfully
andrew
a
dog
she
explained
tutt
announced
tutt
leaning
against
his
senior
partner
door
jamb
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
i
have
landed
a
case
that
will
delight
your
legal
soul
indeed
queried
the
elder
lawyer
i
have
never
differentiated
between
my
legal
soul
and
any
other
i
may
possess
however
i
assume
from
your
remark
that
we
have
been
retained
in
a
matter
presenting
some
peculiarly
absurd
archaic
or
otherwise
interesting
doctrine
of
law
not
directly
responded
tutt
though
you
will
doubtless
find
it
entertaining
enough
but
indirectly
atmospherically
so
to
speak
it
touches
upon
doctrines
of
jurisprudence
of
religion
and
of
philosophy
replete
with
historic
fascination
good
exclaimed
tutt
laying
down
his
stogy
what
kind
of
a
case
is
it
it
a
dog
case
said
the
junior
partner
waving
the
paper
the
dog
bit
somebody
ah
exclaimed
tutt
perceptibly
brightening
doubtless
we
shall
find
a
precedent
in
oliver
goldsmith
famous
elegy
and
in
that
town
a
dog
was
found
as
many
dogs
there
be
both
mongrel
puppy
whelp
and
hound
and
curs
of
low
degree
only
explained
tutt
in
this
case
though
the
man
recovered
of
the
bite
the
dog
refused
to
die
and
so
they
want
to
prosecute
the
dog
it
ca
be
done
an
animal
has
been
brought
to
the
bar
of
justice
for
several
centuries
no
no
interrupted
tutt
they
do
there
was
a
case
went
on
tutt
reminiscently
let
me
see
at
sauvigny
i
think
it
was
about
when
they
tried
a
sow
and
three
pigs
for
killing
a
child
the
court
assigned
a
lawyer
to
defend
her
but
like
many
assigned
counsel
he
could
think
of
anything
to
say
in
her
behalf
as
regards
the
little
pigs
he
did
enter
the
plea
that
no
animus
was
shown
that
they
had
merely
followed
the
example
of
their
mother
and
that
at
worst
they
were
under
age
and
irresponsible
however
the
court
found
them
all
guilty
and
the
sow
was
publicly
hanged
in
the
market
place
what
did
they
do
with
the
three
little
pigs
inquired
tutt
with
some
interest
they
were
pardoned
on
account
of
their
extreme
youth
said
tutt
and
turned
loose
again
with
a
warning
i
glad
of
that
sighed
tutt
is
that
a
real
case
absolutely
replied
his
partner
i
read
it
in
the
sauvigny
records
i
be
hanged
exclaimed
tutt
i
never
knew
that
animals
were
ever
held
personally
responsible
why
of
course
they
were
said
tutt
why
should
they
be
if
animals
have
souls
why
should
they
be
responsible
for
their
acts
but
they
have
any
souls
protested
tutt
have
they
now
remarked
the
elder
lawyer
i
seen
many
an
old
horse
that
had
a
great
deal
more
conscience
than
his
master
and
on
general
principles
would
it
be
far
more
just
and
humane
to
have
the
law
deal
with
a
vicious
animal
that
had
injured
somebody
than
to
leave
its
punishment
to
an
irresponsible
and
arbitrary
owner
who
might
be
guilty
of
extreme
brutality
if
the
punishment
would
do
any
good
yes
agreed
tutt
well
who
knows
meditated
tutt
i
wonder
if
it
ever
does
any
good
but
anybody
would
have
to
agree
that
responsibility
for
one
acts
should
depend
upon
the
degree
of
one
intelligence
and
from
that
point
of
view
many
of
our
friends
are
really
much
less
responsible
than
sheep
which
as
you
so
sagely
point
out
would
however
be
a
poor
reason
for
letting
their
families
punish
them
in
case
they
did
wrong
just
think
how
such
a
privilege
might
be
abused
if
uncle
john
did
behave
himself
as
his
nephews
thought
proper
they
could
simply
set
upon
him
and
briskly
beat
him
up
yes
of
course
the
law
even
recognizes
the
right
to
exercise
physical
discipline
within
the
family
even
homicide
is
excusable
under
section
of
our
code
when
committed
in
lawfully
correcting
a
child
or
servant
that
a
fine
relic
of
barbarism
remarked
tutt
but
the
child
soon
passes
through
that
dangerous
zone
and
becomes
entitled
to
be
tried
for
his
offenses
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
the
animal
never
does
well
an
animal
could
be
tried
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
anyhow
said
tutt
i
seen
juries
that
were
more
like
nanny
goats
than
men
commentated
tutt
i
like
to
see
some
of
our
clients
tried
by
juries
of
geese
or
woodchucks
the
field
of
criminal
responsibility
is
the
no
man
land
of
the
law
mused
tutt
roughly
mental
capacity
to
understand
the
nature
of
one
acts
is
the
test
but
it
is
applied
arbitrarily
in
the
case
of
human
beings
and
a
mere
point
of
time
is
taken
beyond
which
irrespective
of
his
actual
intelligence
a
man
is
held
accountable
for
whatever
he
does
of
course
that
is
theoretically
unsound
the
more
intelligent
a
person
is
the
more
responsible
he
should
be
held
to
be
and
the
higher
the
quality
of
conduct
demanded
of
him
by
his
fellows
yet
after
all
are
held
equally
responsible
unless
actually
insane
it
is
equity
in
theory
no
man
or
animal
should
be
subject
to
the
power
of
discretionary
punishment
on
the
part
of
another
even
his
own
father
or
master
i
often
wondered
what
earthly
right
we
have
to
make
the
animals
work
for
us
to
bind
them
to
slavery
when
we
denounce
slavery
as
a
crime
it
would
horrify
us
to
see
a
human
being
put
up
and
sold
at
auction
yet
we
tear
the
families
of
animals
apart
subject
them
to
lives
of
toil
and
kill
them
whenever
we
see
fit
we
say
we
do
this
because
their
intelligence
is
limited
and
they
can
not
exercise
any
discrimination
in
their
conduct
that
they
are
always
in
the
zone
of
irresponsibility
and
so
have
no
rights
but
i
seen
animals
that
were
shrewder
than
men
and
men
who
were
vastly
less
intelligent
than
animals
assented
tutt
take
scraggs
for
instance
he
no
more
responsible
than
a
chipmunk
nevertheless
the
law
has
always
been
consistent
said
tutt
and
has
never
discriminated
between
animals
any
more
than
it
has
between
men
on
the
ground
of
varying
degrees
of
intelligence
they
used
to
try
all
big
and
little
wild
and
domesticated
mammals
and
invertebrates
oh
come
exclaimed
tutt
i
may
not
know
much
law
but
between
and
they
prosecuted
in
france
alone
no
less
than
animals
the
last
one
was
a
cow
a
cow
has
much
intelligence
observed
tutt
and
they
tried
fleas
added
tutt
they
have
a
lot
commented
his
junior
partner
i
knew
a
flea
once
who
they
had
a
regular
form
of
procedure
continued
tutt
brushing
the
flea
aside
which
was
adhered
to
with
the
utmost
technical
accuracy
you
could
try
an
individual
animal
either
in
person
or
by
proxy
or
you
could
try
a
whole
family
swarm
or
herd
if
a
town
was
infested
by
rats
for
example
they
first
assigned
counsel
an
advocate
he
was
called
and
then
the
defendants
were
summoned
three
times
publicly
to
appear
if
they
did
show
up
on
the
third
and
last
call
they
were
tried
and
if
convicted
were
ordered
out
of
the
country
before
a
certain
date
under
penalty
of
being
exorcised
what
happened
if
they
were
exorcised
asked
tutt
curiously
it
depended
a
good
deal
on
the
local
power
of
satan
answered
the
old
lawyer
dryly
sometimes
they
became
even
more
prolific
and
destructive
than
they
were
before
and
sometimes
they
promptly
died
all
the
leeches
were
prosecuted
at
lausanne
in
a
few
selected
representatives
were
brought
into
court
tried
convicted
and
ordered
to
depart
within
a
fixed
period
maybe
they
did
fully
grasp
their
obligations
or
perhaps
were
just
acting
contemptuously
but
they
did
depart
and
so
were
promptly
exorcised
immediately
they
began
to
die
off
and
before
long
there
were
none
left
in
the
country
i
know
some
rats
and
mice
i
like
to
have
exorcised
mused
tutt
at
autun
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
rats
won
their
case
said
tutt
who
got
off
asked
tutt
chassensée
the
advocate
appointed
to
defend
them
they
had
been
a
great
nuisance
and
were
ordered
to
appear
in
court
but
none
of
them
turned
up
chassensée
therefore
argued
that
a
default
should
not
be
taken
because
the
rats
had
been
summoned
and
some
were
either
so
young
or
so
old
and
decrepit
that
they
needed
more
time
the
court
thereupon
granted
him
an
extension
however
they
did
arrive
on
the
day
set
and
this
time
their
lawyer
claimed
that
they
were
under
duress
and
restrained
by
bodily
fear
of
the
townspeople
cats
that
all
these
cats
therefore
should
first
be
bound
over
to
keep
the
peace
the
court
admitted
the
reasonableness
of
this
but
the
townsfolk
refused
to
be
responsible
for
their
cats
and
the
judge
dismissed
the
case
what
did
chassensée
get
out
of
it
inquired
tutt
there
is
no
record
of
who
paid
him
or
what
was
his
fee
he
was
a
pretty
slick
lawyer
observed
tutt
did
they
ever
try
birds
oh
yes
answered
tutt
they
tried
a
cock
at
basel
in
for
the
crime
of
laying
an
egg
why
was
that
a
crime
asked
tutt
i
should
call
it
a
de
be
that
as
it
may
said
his
partner
from
a
cock
egg
is
hatched
the
cockatrice
or
basilisk
the
glance
of
whose
eye
turns
the
beholder
to
stone
therefore
they
tried
the
cock
found
him
guilty
and
burned
him
and
his
egg
together
at
the
stake
that
is
why
cocks
do
lay
eggs
now
i
glad
to
know
that
said
tutt
when
did
they
give
up
trying
animals
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
answered
tutt
but
for
some
time
after
that
they
continued
to
try
inanimate
objects
for
causing
injury
to
people
i
heard
they
tried
one
of
the
first
locomotives
that
ran
over
a
man
and
declared
it
forfeit
to
the
crown
as
a
deodand
i
wonder
if
you
could
get
to
try
andrew
hazarded
tutt
and
maybe
declare
him
forfeited
to
somebody
as
a
deodand
deodand
means
to
god
explained
tutt
well
i
give
andrew
to
god
if
god
would
take
him
declared
tutt
devoutly
but
who
is
andrew
asked
tutt
andrew
is
a
dog
said
tutt
who
bit
one
tunnygate
and
now
the
grand
jury
have
indicted
not
the
dog
as
it
is
clear
from
your
historical
disquisition
they
should
have
done
but
the
dog
owner
enoch
appleboy
what
for
assault
in
the
second
degree
with
a
dangerous
weapon
what
was
the
weapon
inquired
tutt
simply
the
dog
what
are
you
talking
about
cried
tutt
what
nonsense
yes
it
is
nonsense
agreed
tutt
but
they
done
it
all
the
same
read
it
for
yourself
and
he
handed
tutt
the
indictment
the
grand
jury
of
the
county
of
new
york
by
this
indictment
accuse
enoch
appleboy
of
the
crime
of
assault
in
the
second
degree
committed
as
follows
said
enoch
appleboy
late
of
the
borough
of
bronx
city
and
county
aforesaid
on
the
day
of
july
in
the
year
of
our

one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
fifteen
at
the

with
force
and
arms
in
and
upon
one
herman
tunnygate
in
the
peace
of
the
state
and
people
then
and
there
being
feloniously
did
willfully
and
wrongfully
make
an
assault
in
and
upon
the
legs
and
body
of
him
the
said
herman
tunnygate
by
means
of
a
certain
dangerous
weapon
to
wit
one
dog
of
the
form
style
and
breed
known
as
being
of
the
name
of
then
and
there
being
within
control
of
the
said
enoch
appleboy
which
said
dog
being
of
the
name
of
the
said
enoch
appleboy
did
then
and
there
feloniously
willfully
and
wrongfully
incite
provoke
and
encourage
then
and
there
being
to
bite
him
the
said
herman
tunnygate
by

whereof
said
dog
did
then
and
there
grievously
bite
the
said
herman
tunnygate
in
and
upon
the
legs
and
body
of
him
the
said
herman
tunnygate
and
the
said
enoch
appleboy
thus
then
and
there
feloniously
did
willfully
and
wrongfully
cut
tear
lacerate
and
bruise
and
did
then
and
there
by
the
means
of
the
dog
aforesaid
feloniously
willfully
and
wrongfully
inflict
grievous
bodily
harm
upon
the
said
herman
tunnygate
against
the
form
of
the
statute
in
such
case
made
and
provided
and
against
the
peace
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
their
dignity
that
asserted
tutt
wiping
his
spectacles
is
a
document
worthy
of
preservation
in
the
congressional
library
who
drew
it
do
know
answered
tutt
but
whoever
he
was
he
was
a
humorist
it
no
good
there
is
any
allegation
of
in
it
affirmed
tutt
what
of
it
it
says
he
assaulted
tunnygate
with
a
dangerous
weapon
you
do
have
to
set
forth
that
he
knew
it
was
a
dangerous
weapon
if
you
assert
that
he
did
it
willfully
you
do
have
to
allege
in
an
indictment
charging
an
assault
with
a
pistol
that
the
defendant
knew
it
was
loaded
but
a
dog
is
different
reasoned
tutt
a
dog
is
not
a
dangerous
weapon
saying
so
does
make
it
so
and
that
part
of
the
indictment
is
bad
on
its
face
unless
to
be
sure
it
means
that
he
hit
him
with
a
dead
dog
which
it
is
clear
from
the
context
that
he
did
the
other
part
that
he
set
the
dog
on
him
lacks
the
allegation
that
the
dog
was
vicious
and
that
appleboy
knew
it
in
other
words
an
allegation
of
it
ought
to
read
that
said
enoch
appleboy
knowing
that
said
dog
andrew
was
a
dangerous
and
ferocious
animal
and
would
if
incited
provoked
and
encouraged
bite
the
legs
and
body
of
him
the
said
herman
did
then
and
there
feloniously
willfully
and
wrongfully
incite
provoke
and
encourage
the
said
andrew
and
so
forth
i
get
you
exclaimed
tutt
enthusiastically
of
course
an
allegation
of
is
necessary
in
other
words
you
could
demur
to
the
indictment
for
insufficiency
tutt
nodded
but
in
that
case
they
merely
go
before
the
grand
jury
and
find
another
a
good
one
it
much
better
to
try
and
knock
the
case
out
on
the
trial
once
and
for
all
well
the
appleboys
are
waiting
to
see
you
said
tutt
they
are
in
my
office
bonnie
doon
got
the
case
for
us
off
his
local
district
leader
who
a
member
of
the
same
lodge
of
the
abyssinian
mysteries
been
supreme
exalted
ruler
of
the
purple
mountain
for
over
a
year
and
he
pulled
in
quite
a
lot
of
good
stuff
not
all
dog
cases
either
appleboy
an
abyssinian
too
i
see
them
consented
tutt
but
i
going
to
have
you
try
the
case
i
shall
insist
upon
acting
solely
in
an
advisory
capacity
dog
trials
are
in
my
line
there
are
some
things
which
are
even
for
ephraim
tutt
appleboy
sat
stolidly
at
the
bar
of
justice
pale
but
resolute
beside
him
sat
appleboy
also
pale
but
even
more
resolute
a
jury
had
been
selected
without
much
manifest
attention
by
tutt
who
had
nevertheless
managed
to
slip
in
an
abyssinian
brother
on
the
back
row
and
an
fancier
for
number
six
also
among
those
present
were
a
delicatessen
man
from
east
houston
street
a
dealer
in
rubber
novelties
a
plumber
and
the
editor
of
baby
world
the
foreman
was
almost
as
fat
as
appleboy
but
tutt
regarded
this
as
an
even
break
on
account
of
the
size
of
tunnygate
as
tutt
confidently
whispered
to
appleboy
it
was
as
rotten
a
jury
as
he
could
get
appleboy
did
understand
why
tutt
should
want
a
rotten
jury
but
she
nevertheless
imbibed
some
vicarious
confidence
from
this
statement
and
squeezed
appleboy
hand
encouragingly
for
appleboy
in
spite
of
his
apparent
calm
was
a
very
much
frightened
man
and
under
the
creases
of
his
floppy
waistcoat
his
heart
was
beating
like
a
the
penalty
for
assault
in
the
second
degree
was
ten
years
in
prison
and
life
with
bashemath
even
in
the
vicinity
of
the
tunnygates
seemed
sweet
the
thought
of
breaking
stones
under
the
summer
sun
it
was
a
peculiarly
hot
summer
was
awful
ten
years
he
could
never
live
through
it
and
yet
as
his
glance
fell
upon
the
tunnygates
arrayed
in
their
best
finery
and
sitting
with
an
air
of
importance
upon
the
front
bench
of
the
court
room
he
told
himself
that
he
would
do
the
whole
thing
all
over
again
yes
he
would
he
had
only
stood
up
for
his
rights
and
tunnygate
blood
was
upon
his
own
head
or
wherever
it
was
so
he
squeezed
bashemath
hand
tenderly
in
response
upon
the
bench
judge
witherspoon
assigned
from
somewhere
upstate
to
help
keep
down
the
criminal
calendar
of
the
metropolitan
district
finished
the
letter
he
was
writing
to
his
wife
in
genesee
county
sealed
it
and
settled
back
in
his
chair
an
old
war
horse
of
the
country
bar
he
had
in
his
time
been
mixed
up
in
almost
every
kind
of
litigation
but
as
he
looked
over
the
indictment
he
with
difficulty
repressed
a
smile
thirty
years
ago
he
had
a
dog
case
himself
also
of
the
form
style
and
breed
known
as
bull
you
may
proceed
mister
district
attorney
he
announced
and
little
pepperill
the
youngest
of
the
staff
just
out
of
the
law
school
begoggled
and
with
his
hair
plastered
evenly
down
on
either
side
of
his
small
round
head
rose
with
serious
mien
and
with
a
high
piping
voice
opened
the
prosecution
it
was
he
told
them
a
most
unusual
and
hence
most
important
case
the
defendant
appleboy
had
maliciously
procured
a
savage
dog
of
the
most
vicious
sort
and
loosed
it
upon
the
innocent
complainant
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
work
with
the
result
that
the
latter
had
nearly
been
torn
to
shreds
it
was
a
horrible
dastardly
incredible
fiendish
crime
he
would
expect
them
to
do
their
full
duty
in
the
premises
and
they
should
hear
tunnygate
story
from
his
own
lips
tunnygate
limped
with
difficulty
to
the
stand
and
having
been
sworn
gingerly
sat
down
partially
then
turning
his
broadside
to
the
gaping
jury
he
recounted
his
woes
with
indignant
gasps
have
you
the
trousers
which
you
wore
upon
that
occasion
inquired
pepperill
tunnygate
bowed
solemnly
and
lifted
from
the
floor
a
paper
parcel
which
he
untied
and
from
which
he
drew
what
remained
of
that
now
historic
garment
these
are
they
he
announced
dramatically
i
offer
them
in
evidence
exclaimed
pepperill
and
i
ask
the
jury
to
examine
them
with
great
care
they
did
so
tutt
waited
until
the
trousers
had
been
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
returned
to
their
owner
then
rotund
chipper
and
birdlike
as
ever
began
his
much
like
a
woodpecker
attacking
a
stout
stump
the
witness
had
been
an
old
friend
of
appleboy
had
he
not
tunnygate
admitted
it
and
tutt
pecked
him
again
never
had
done
him
any
wrong
had
he
nothing
in
particular
well
any
wrong
tunnygate
hesitated
why
yes
appleboy
had
tried
to
fence
in
the
public
beach
that
belonged
to
everybody
well
did
that
do
the
witness
any
harm
the
witness
declared
that
it
did
compelled
him
to
go
round
when
he
had
a
right
to
go
across
oh
tutt
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
glanced
at
the
jury
how
many
feet
about
twenty
feet
then
tutt
pecked
a
little
harder
did
you
tear
a
hole
in
the
hedge
and
stamp
down
the
grass
when
by
taking
a
few
extra
steps
you
could
have
reached
the
beach
without
difficulty
i
i
simply
tried
to
remove
an
illegal
obstruction
declared
tunnygate
indignantly
did
appleboy
ask
you
to
keep
off
sure
yes
did
you
obstinately
refuse
to
do
so
pepperill
objected
to
obstinately
and
it
was
stricken
out
i
was
going
to
stay
off
where
i
had
a
right
to
go
asserted
the
witness
and
did
you
have
warning
that
the
dog
was
there
look
here
suddenly
burst
out
tunnygate
you
ca
hector
me
into
anything
appleboy
never
had
a
dog
before
he
got
a
dog
just
to
sic
him
on
me
he
put
up
a
sign
of
the
dog
but
he
knew
that
i
think
it
was
just
a
bluff
it
was
a
plant
that
what
it
was
and
just
as
soon
as
i
got
inside
the
hedge
that
dog
went
for
me
and
nearly
tore
me
to
bits
it
was
a
rotten
thing
to
do
and
you
know
it
he
subsided
panting
tutt
bowed
complacently
i
move
that
the
witness
remarks
be
stricken
out
on
the
grounds
first
that
they
are
unresponsive
second
that
they
are
irrelevant
incompetent
and
immaterial
third
that
they
contain
expressions
of
opinion
and
hearsay
and
fourth
that
they
are
abusive
and
generally
improper
strike
them
out
directed
judge
witherspoon
then
he
turned
to
tunnygate
the
essence
of
your
testimony
is
that
the
defendant
set
a
dog
on
you
is
it
not
you
had
quarreled
with
the
defendant
with
whom
you
had
formerly
been
on
friendly
terms
you
entered
on
premises
claimed
to
be
owned
by
him
though
a
sign
warned
you
to
beware
of
a
dog
the
dog
attacked
and
bit
you
that
the
case
is
it
yes
your
honor
had
you
ever
seen
that
dog
before
no
sir
do
you
know
where
he
got
it
my
wife
told
me
never
mind
what
your
wife
told
you
do
you
he
do
know
where
the
dog
came
from
judge
suddenly
called
out
tunnygate
in
strident
tones
from
where
she
was
sitting
but
i
know
she
added
venomously
that
woman
of
his
got
it
from
judge
witherspoon
fixed
her
coldly
with
an
impassive
and
judicial
eye
will
you
kindly
be
silent
madam
you
will
no
doubt
be
given
an
opportunity
to
testify
as
fully
as
you
wish
that
is
all
sir
unless
tutt
has
some
more
questions
tutt
waved
the
witness
from
the
stand
contemptuously
well
i
like
a
chance
to
testify
shrilled
tunnygate
rising
in
full
panoply
this
way
madam
said
the
clerk
motioning
her
round
the
back
of
the
jury
box
and
she
swept
ponderously
into
the
offing
like
a
bark
and
came
to
anchor
in
the
witness
chair
her
chin
rising
and
falling
upon
her
heaving
bosom
like
the
figurehead
of
a
vessel
upon
a
heavy
harbor
swell
now
it
has
never
been
satisfactorily
explained
just
why
the
character
of
an
individual
should
be
in
any
way
deducible
from
such
irrelevant
attributes
as
facial
anatomy
bodily
structure
or
the
shape
of
the
cranium
perhaps
it
is
not
and
in
reality
we
discern
disposition
from
something
far
more
subtle
the
tone
of
the
voice
the
expression
of
the
eyes
the
lines
of
the
face
or
even
from
an
aura
unperceived
by
the
senses
however
that
may
be
the
wisdom
of
the
constitutional
safeguard
guaranteeing
that
every
person
charged
with
crime
shall
be
confronted
by
the
witnesses
against
him
was
instantly
made
apparent
when
tunnygate
took
the
stand
for
without
hearing
a
word
from
her
firmly
compressed
lips
the
jury
simultaneously
swept
her
with
one
comprehensive
glance
and
turned
away
students
of
women
experienced
adventurers
in
matrimony
these
plumbers
bird
merchants
delicatessens
and
the
rest
looked
perceived
and
comprehended
that
here
was
the
very
devil
of
a
woman
a
virago
a
shrew
a
termagant
a
and
they
shivered
and
thanked
god
that
she
was
tunnygate
and
not
theirs
their
unformulated
sentiment
best
expressed
in
pope
immortal
couplet
oh
woman
woman
when
to
ill
thy
mind
is
bent
all
hell
contains
no
fouler
fiend
she
had
said
no
word
between
the
judge
and
jury
nothing
had
passed
and
yet
through
the
alpha
rays
of
that
mysterious
medium
of
communication
by
which
all
men
as
men
are
united
where
woman
is
concerned
the
thought
was
directly
transmitted
and
unanimously
acknowledged
that
here
for
sure
was
a
hell
cat
it
was
as
naught
to
them
that
she
testified
to
the
outrageous
illegality
of
the
appleboys
territorial
ambitions
the
irascibility
of
the
wife
the
violent
threats
of
the
husband
or
that
appleboy
had
been
observed
to
mail
a
suspicious
letter
shortly
before
the
date
of
the
canine
assault
they
disregarded
her
yet
when
tutt
upon
sought
to
attack
her
credibility
by
asking
her
various
pertinent
questions
they
unhesitatingly
accepted
his
implied
accusations
as
true
though
under
the
rules
of
evidence
he
was
bound
by
her
denials
peck
did
you
not
knock
appleboy
flower
pots
off
the
piazza
he
demanded
significantly
never
i
never
did
she
declared
passionately
but
they
knew
in
their
hearts
that
she
had
peck
did
you
steal
her
milk
bottles
what
a
lie
it
absolutely
false
yet
they
knew
that
she
did
peck
did
you
tangle
up
their
fish
lines
and
take
their
well
i
never
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
ask
a
lady
such
questions
they
found
her
guilty
i
move
to
dismiss
your
honor
chirped
tutt
blithely
at
the
conclusion
of
her
testimony
judge
witherspoon
shook
his
head
i
want
to
hear
the
other
side
he
remarked
the
mere
fact
that
the
defendant
put
up
a
sign
warning
the
public
against
the
dog
may
be
taken
as
some
evidence
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
animal
vicious
propensities
i
shall
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury
unless
this
evidence
is
contradicted
or
explained
reserve
your
motion
very
well
your
honor
agreed
tutt
patting
himself
upon
the
abdomen
i
will
follow
your
suggestion
and
call
the
defendant
appleboy
take
the
stand
appleboy
heavily
rose
and
the
heart
of
every
fat
man
upon
the
jury
and
particularly
that
of
the
abyssinian
brother
upon
the
back
row
went
out
to
him
for
just
as
they
had
known
without
being
told
that
the
new
tunnygate
was
a
vixen
they
realized
that
appleboy
was
a
kind
man
a
little
soft
perhaps
like
his
clams
but
no
more
dangerous
moreover
it
was
plain
that
he
had
suffered
and
was
indeed
still
suffering
and
they
had
pity
for
him
appleboy
voice
shook
and
so
did
the
rest
of
his
person
as
he
recounted
his
ancient
friendship
for
tunnygate
and
their
piscatorial
association
their
common
matrimonial
experiences
the
sudden
change
in
the
temperature
of
the
society
of
throggs
neck
the
malicious
destruction
of
their
property
and
the
unexplained
aggressions
of
tunnygate
upon
the
lawn
and
the
jury
believing

then
like
the
sword
of
damocles

bessemer
voice
of

amiability
where
did
you

that
dog
appleboy
looked
round

she
come

you

anything
about

interjected
tutt
sharply
oh
no

appleboy
did
you
know
it
was
a
vicious
beast
sharply
challenged

of
your

your

tell
you
about
it
tutt

to
his
feet
wildly
waving
his
arms
i
object
on
the
ground
that
what
passed
between
husband
and

upon
this
subject
must
be
regarded
as
confidential
i
will
so
rule
said

witherspoon
smiling

pepperill
shrugged
his

i
would
like
to
ask
a
question

the
editor
of

exclaimed
tutt

the
editor
who
was
a
fat
editor
rose
in
an
embarrassed
manner
mr
appleboy
he
began
yes

responded
appleboy
i
want
to
get
this
straight

and
your
wife

a
row
with
the
tunnygates

tried
to
tear
up
your
front
lawn

warned
him
off
he
kept
on
doing
it
you
got
a
dog
and
put
up
a
sign
and
when
he
disregarded
it
you
sicked
the
dog
on
him
is
that
right
he
was
manifestly
friendly
merely
a
bit
cloudy
in
the
cerebellum
the
abyssinian
brother
pulled
him
sharply
by
the
coat
tails
sit
down
he
whispered
hoarsely
you
gumming
it
all
up
i
did
sic
andrew
on
him
protested
appleboy
but
i
say
why
should
he
have
demanded
the
baby
editor
what
anybody
would
do
pepperill
sprang
frantically
to
his
feet
oh
i
object
this
juryman

is
entirely
improper

sputtered
the
fat
editor
angrily
i
show

you
whined
pepperill
i
proved
that
the
appleboys
had
no
right

sneered
the
abyssinian
now
also
getting
to
his
feet

tunnygate
deserved
all

production
of

made
her
way

appleboy
firmly
i

declared
tutt
with
a
triumphant
smile
then
snapped
pepperill
why
did
you
send
for

i
was
lonely
answered
bashemath
unblushingly
do
you
mean
to
tell
this
jury
that
you
did
know
that
that
dog
was
one
of
the
worst
biters
in
livornia
i
do
she
replied
i
only
knew
aunt
eliza
had
a
dog
i
did
know
anything
about
the
dog
personally
what
did
you
say
to
your
aunt
in
your
letter
i
said
i
was
lonely
and
wanted
protection
did
you
hope
the
dog
would
bite
mr
tunnygate
why
no
she
declared
i
did
want
him
to
bite
anybody
at
that
the
delicatessen
man
poked
the
plumber
in
the
ribs
and
they
both
grinned
happily
at
one
another
pepperill
gave
her
a
last
disgusted
look
and
sank
back
in
his
seat
that
is
all
he
ejaculated
feebly
one
question
if
you
please
madam
said
judge
witherspoon
may
i
be
permitted
to
he
coughed
as
a
suppressed
snicker
ran
round
the
court
that

not

oh
look
here
how
did
you
happen
to
have
the
idea
of
getting
a
dog
appleboy
turned
the
full
moon
of
her
homely
countenance
upon
the
court
the
potato
peel
came
down
that
way
she
explained
blandly
what
exploded
the
dealer
in
rubber
novelties
the
potato
peel
it
spelled
she
repeated
artlessly
lord
deeply
suspirated
pepperill
what
a
case
carry
me
out
well
tutt
said
the
judge
now
i
will
hear
what
you
may
wish
to
say
upon
the
question
of
whether
this
issue
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
however
i
shall
rule
that
the
indictment
is
sufficient
tutt
elegantly
rose
having
due
respect
to
your
honor
ruling
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
i
shall
address
myself
simply
to
the
question
of
i
might
of
course
dwell
upon
the
impropriety
of
charging
the
defendant
with
criminal
responsibility
for
the
act
of
another
free
agent
even
if
that
agent
be
an
animal
but
i
will
leave
that
if
necessary
for
the
court
of
appeals
if
anybody
were
to
be
indicted
in
this
case
i
hold
it
should
have
been
the
dog
andrew
nay
i
do
not
jest
but
i
can
see
by
your
honor
expression
that
any
argument
upon
that
score
would
be
without
avail
entirely
remarked
witherspoon
kindly
go
on
well
continued
tutt
the
law
of
this
matter
needs
no
elucidation
it
has
been
settled
since
the
time
of
moses
of
whom
inquired
witherspoon
you
do
need
to
go
back
farther
than
chief
justice
marshall
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
tutt
bowed
it
is
an
established
doctrine
of
the
common
law
both
of
england
and
america
that
it
is
wholly
proper
for
one
to
keep
a
domestic
animal
for
his
use
pleasure
or
protection
until
as
dykeman
says
in
muller
mckesson
vicious
propensity
is
developed
and
brought
out
to
the
knowledge
of
the
owner
up
to
that
time
the
man
who
keeps
a
dog
or
other
animal
can
not
be
charged
with
liability
for
his
acts
this
has
always
been
the
law
in
the
chapter
of
exodus
at
the
verse
it
is
written
an
ox
gore
a
man
or
a
woman
that
they
die
then
the
ox
shall
be
surely
stoned
and
his
flesh
shall
not
be
eaten
but
the
owner
of
the
ox
shall
be
quit
but
if
the
ox
were
wont
to
push
with
his
horn
in
time
past
and
it
hath
been
testified
to
his
owner
and
he
hath
not
kept
him
in
but
that
he
hath
killed
a
man
or
a
woman
the
ox
shall
be
stoned
and
his
owner
also
shall
be
put
to
death
in
the
old
english
case
of
smith
pehal
strange
it
was
said
by
the
court
a
dog
has
once
bit
a
man
and
the
owner
having
notice
thereof
keeps
the
dog
and
lets
him
go
about
or
lie
at
his
door
an
action
will
lie
against
him
at
the
suit
of
a
person
who
is
bit
though
it
happened
by
such
person
treading
on
the
dog
toes
for
it
was
owing
to
his
not
hanging
the
dog
on
the
first
notice
and
the
safety
of
the
king
subjects
ought
not
afterwards
to
be
endangered
that
is
sound
law
but
it
is
equally
good
law
that
a
person
with
full
knowledge
of
the
evil
propensities
of
an
animal
wantonly
excites
him
or
voluntarily
and
unnecessarily
puts
himself
in
the
way
of
such
an
animal
he
would
be
adjudged
to
have
brought
the
injury
upon
himself
and
ought
not
to
be
entitled
to
recover
in
such
a
case
it
can
not
be
said
in
a
legal
sense
that
the
keeping
of
the
animal
which
is
the
gravamen
of
the
offense
produced
the
injury
now
in
the
case
at
bar
first
there
is
clearly
no
evidence
that
this
defendant
knew
or
ever
suspected
that
the
dog
andrew
was
otherwise
than
of
a
mild
and
gentle
disposition
that
is
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
of
in
fact
except
in
this
single
instance
there
is
no
evidence
that
andrew
ever
bit
anybody
thus
in
the
word
of
holy
writ
the
defendant
appleboy
should
be
quit
and
in
the
language
of
our
own
courts
he
must
be
held
harmless
secondly
moreover
it
appears
that
the
complainant
deliberately
put
himself
in
the
way
of
the
dog
andrew
after
full
warning
i
move
that
the
jury
be
directed
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
motion
granted
nodded
judge
witherspoon
burying
his
nose
in
his
handkerchief
i
hold
that
every
dog
is
entitled
to
one
bite
gentlemen
of
the
jury
chanted
the
clerk
how
say
you
do
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
returned
the
foreman
eagerly
amid
audible
evidences
of
satisfaction
from
the
abyssinian
brother
the
baby
world
editor
and
the
others
appleboy
clung
to
tutt
hand
overcome
by
emotion
adjourn
court
ordered
the
judge
then
he
beckoned
to
appleboy
come
up
here
he
directed
timidly
appleboy
approached
the
dais
do
do
it
again
remarked
his
honor
shortly
eh
beg
pardon
your
honor
i
mean
i
said
do
it
again
repeated
the
judge
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
then
lowering
his
voice
he
whispered
you
see
i
come
from
livornia
and
i
known
andrew
for
a
long
time
as
tutt
guided
the
appleboys
out
into
the
corridor
the
party
came
face
to
face
with
and
tunnygate
huh
sneered
tunnygate
huh
retorted
appleboy
wile
versus
guile
for
is
the
sport
to
have
the
engineer
hoist
with
his
own
hamlet
it
was
a
mouse
by
virtue
of
which
ephraim
tutt
had
leaped
into
fame
it
is
true
that
other
characters
famous
in
song
and
story
particularly
in
mother
goose
have
similarly
owed
their
celebrity
in
whole
or
part
to
rodents
but
there
is
it
is
submitted
no
other
case
of
a
mouse
as
mouse
reported
in
the
annals
of
the
law
except
tutt
mouse
from
doomsday
book
down
to
the
present
time
yet
it
is
doubtful
whether
without
his
mouse
ephraim
tutt
would
ever
have
been
heard
of
at
all
and
same
would
equally
have
been
true
if
when
pursued
by
the
chef
gray
cat
the
mouse
aforesaid
had
jumped
in
another
direction
but
as
luck
would
have
it
said
mouse
leaped
foolishly
into
an
open
casserole
upon
a
stove
in
the
kitchen
of
the
comers
hotel
and
tutt
became
in
his
way
a
leader
of
the
bar
it
is
quite
true
that
the
tragic
end
of
the
mouse
in
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
present
narrative
except
as
a
side
light
upon
the
vagaries
of
the
legal
career
but
it
illustrates
how
an
attorney
if
he
expects
to
succeed
in
his
profession
must
be
ready
for
anything
that
comes
along
even
if
it
be
a
mouse
the
two
tutts
composing
the
firm
of
tutt
tutt
were
both
at
the
time
of
the
mouse
case
comparatively
young
men
tutt
was
a
native
of
bangor
maine
and
numbered
among
his
childhood
friends
one
newbegin
a
commercial
wayfarer
in
the
shingle
and
clapboard
line
and
as
he
hoped
at
some
future
time
to
draw
newbegin
will
or
to
incorporate
for
him
some
business
venture
tutt
made
a
practise
of
entertaining
his
prospective
client
at
dinner
upon
his
various
visits
to
the
metropolis
first
at
one
new
york
hostelry
and
then
at
another
chance
led
them
one
night
to
the
comers
and
there
amid
the
imitation
palms
and
imitation
french
waiters
of
the
imitation
french
restaurant
tutt
invited
his
friend
newbegin
to
select
what
dish
he
chose
from
those
upon
the
bill
of
fare
and
newbegin
chose
kidney
stew
it
was
at
about
that
moment
that
the
adventure
which
has
been
referred
to
occurred
in
the
hotel
kitchen
the
gray
cat
was
cheated
of
its
prey
and
in
due
course
the
casserole
containing
the
stew
was
borne
into
the
dining
room
and
the
dish
was
served
suddenly
newbegin
contorted
his
mouth
and
exclaimed
heck
a
mouse
it
was
the
head
waiter
was
summoned
the
manager
the
owner
guests
and
garçons
crowded
about
tutt
and
newbegin
to
inspect
what
had
so
unexpectedly
been
found
no
one
could
deny
that
it
was
mouse
cooked
mouse
and
newbegin
had
ordered
kidney
stew
then
tutt
had
had
his
inspiration
you
shall
pay
well
for
this
he
cried
frowning
at
the
distressed
proprietor
while
newbegin
leaned
piteously
against
a
pillar
this
is
an
outrage
you
shall
be
held
liable
in
heavy
damages
for
my
client
indigestion
and
thus
tutt
tutt
got
their
first
case
out
of
newbegin
for
under
the
influence
of
the
eloquence
of
tutt
a
jury
was
induced
to
give
him
a
verdict
of
one
thousand
dollars
against
the
comers
hotel
which
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
in
the
following
words
quoting
verbatim
from
the
learned
brief
furnished
by
tutt
tutt
ephraim
tutt
of
counsel
the
only
legal
question
in
the
case
or
so
it
appears
to
us
is
whether
there
is
such
a
sale
of
food
to
a
guest
on
the
part
of
the
proprietor
as
will
sustain
a
warranty
if
we
are
not
in
error
however
the
law
is
settled
and
has
been
since
the
reign
of
henry
the
sixth
in
the
ninth
year
book
of
that
monarch
reign
there
is
a
case
in
which
it
was
held
that
i
go
to
a
tavern
to
eat
and
the
taverner
gives
and
sells
me
meat
and
it
corrupted
whereby
i
am
made
very
sick
action
lies
against
him
without
any
express
warranty
for
there
is
a
warranty
in
law
and
in
the
time
of
henry
the
seventh
the
learned
justice
keilway
said
man
can
justify
selling
corrupt
victual
but
an
action
on
the
case
lies
against
the
seller
whether
the
victual
was
warranted
to
be
good
or
not
now
certainly
whether
mouse
meat
be
or
be
not
deleterious
to
health
a
guest
at
a
hotel
who
orders
a
portion
of
kidney
stew
has
the
right
to
expect
and
the
hotel
keeper
impliedly
warrants
that
such
dish
will
contain
no
ingredients
beyond
those
ordinarily
placed
therein
a
thousand
dollars
exulted
tutt
when
the
verdict
was
rendered
why
anyone
would
eat
mouse
for
a
thousand
dollars
the
comers
hotel
became
in
due
course
a
client
of
tutt
tutt
and
the
mouse
which
made
tutt
famous
did
not
die
in
vain
for
the
case
became
celebrated
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
to
the
glory
of
the
firm
and
a
vast
improvement
in
the
culinary
conditions
existing
in
hotels
come
in
barrows
come
right
in
i
have
seen
you
for
well
how
long
is
it
exclaimed
tutt
extending
a
long
welcoming
arm
toward
a
human
scarecrow
upon
the
threshold
five
years
answered
the
visitor
i
only
got
out
day
before
yesterday
fourteen
months
off
for
good
behavior
he
coughed
and
put
down
carefully
beside
him
a
large
case
marked
pottsville
well
well
sighed
tutt
so
it
is
how
time
flies
not
in
sing
sing
replied
barrows
ruefully
i
suppose
not
still
it
must
feel
good
to
be
out
barrows
made
no
reply
but
dusted
off
his
felt
hat
he
was
but
the
shadow
of
a
man
an
old
man
at
that
as
was
attested
by
his
long
gray
beard
his
faded
blue
eyes
and
the
thin
white
hair
about
his
fine
domelike
forehead
i
forget
what
your
trouble
was
about
said
tutt
gently
wo
you
have
a
stogy
barrows
shook
his
head
i
ai
used
to
it
he
answered
makes
me
cough
he
gazed
about
him
vaguely
something
about
bonds
was
it
asked
tutt
yes
replied
barrows
great
lakes
and
canadian
southern
of
course
of
course
a
wonderful
property
murmured
barrows
regretfully
the
bonds
were
perfectly
good
there
was
a
defect
in
the
foreclosure
proceedings
which
made
them
a
permanent
underlying
security
of
the
reorganized
company
under
the
northern
pacific
boyd
you
know
but
the
court
refused
to
hold
that
way
they
never
will
hold
the
way
you
want
will
they
he
looked
innocently
at
tutt
no
agreed
the
latter
with
conviction
they
never
will
now
those
bonds
were
as
good
as
gold
went
on
the
old
man
and
yet
they
said
i
had
to
go
to
prison
you
know
all
about
it
you
were
my
lawyer
yes
assented
tutt
i
remember
all
about
it
now
indeed
it
had
all
come
back
to
him
with
the
vividness
of
a
landscape
seen
during
a
lightning
flash
the
crowded
court
old
doc
barrows
upon
the
witness
stand
charged
with
getting
money
on
the
strength
of
defaulted
and
outlawed
bonds
picked
up
heaven
knows
where
pathetically
trying
to
persuade
an
unsympathetic
court
that
for
some
reason
they
were
still
worth
their
face
value
though
the
mortgage
securing
the
debt
which
they
represented
had
long
since
been
foreclosed
and
the
money
distributed
i
paid
for
actual
cash
he
rambled
on
not
much
to
be
sure
but
real
money
if
i
got
cheap
that
was
my
good
luck
it
it
was
because
my
brain
was
sharper
than
other
folks
i
said
they
had
value
and
i
say
so
now
only
nobody
will
believe
it
or
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
i
learned
a
lot
up
there
in
sing
sing
too
he
continued
warming
to
his
subject
do
you
know
sir
there
are
fortunes
lying
all
about
us
take
gold
for
instance
there
a
fraction
of
a
grain
in
every
ton
of
sea
water
but
the
big
people
do
want
it
taken
out
because
it
would
depress
the
standard
of
exchange
i
say
it
a
conspiracy
and
yet
they
jailed
a
man
for
it
there
great
mineral
deposits
all
about
just
waiting
for
the
right
man
to
come
along
and
develop
his
lifted
eye
rested
upon
the
engraving
of
abraham
lincoln
over

there
was
a
man
he
exclaimed
inconsequently
then
stopped
and
ran
his
transparent
heavily
veined
old
hand
over
his
forehead
where
was
i
let
me
see
oh
yes
gold
all
those
great
properties
could
be
bought
at
one
time
or
another
for
a
song
it
needed
a
pioneer
that
what
i
was
a
pioneer
to
find
the
gold
where
other
people
could
find
it
that
not
any
crime
it
a
service
to
humanity
if
only
they
have
a
little
faith
instead
of
locking
you
up
the
judge
never
looked
up
the
law
about
those
great
lakes
bonds
if
he
had
he
have
found
out
i
was
right
i
looked
it
up
i
studied
law
once
myself
i
know
said
tutt
almost
moved
to
tears
by
the
sight
of
the
wreck
before
him
you
practised
up
state
did
you
yes
responded
doc
barrows
eagerly
and
in
chicago
too
i
a
member
of
the
cook
county
bar
i
tell
you
something
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
been
wrong
in
its
law
i
be
the
richest
man
in
the
world
in
the
whole
world
he
grabbed
tutt
by
the
arm
and
stared
hard
into
his
eyes
did
i
show
you
my
papers
i
own
seven
feet
of
water
front
clean
round
lake
michigan
all
through
the
city
of
chicago
i
got
it
for
a
song
from
the
man
who
found
out
the
flaw
in
the
original
title
deed
of
he
was
dying
sell
my
secret
to
you
he
says
i
passing
on
may
it
bring
you
luck
i
looked
it
all
up
and
it
was
just
as
he
said
so
i
got
up
a
corporation
the
chicago
water
front
and
terminal
company
and
sold
bonds
to
fight
my
claim
in
the
courts
but
all
the
people
who
had
deeds
to
my
land
conspired
against
me
and
had
me
arrested
they
sent
me
to
the
penitentiary
justice
for
you
that
was
too
bad
said
tutt
in
a
soothing
voice
but
after
all
what
good
would
all
that
money
have
done
you
i
do
want
money
affirmed
doc
plaintively
i
never
needed
money
i
know
enough
secrets
to
make
me
rich
a
dozen
times
over
not
money
but
justice
is
what
i
want
my
legal
rights
but
i
tired
of
fighting
against
they
beaten
me
yes
they
beaten

going
to
retire
that
why
i
came
in
to
see

your
services
as
my
attorney

with
her
she
was
such
a
dear
little

found
out
a
gold
mine
on
her
farm
only
she
does
know
it
a
rich
vein
runs
right
through
her
cow
pasture
we
be
rich
would
it
be
fine
tutt
to
be
rich
then
i
going
to
pay
you
in
real
money
for
all
done
for
me
thousands
but
until
then
i
going
to
let
you
have
these
all
my
securities
my
own
you
know
every
one
of
them
he
placed
the
suitcase
in
front
of
tutt
and
opened
the
clasps
with
his
shaking
old
fingers
it
bulged
with
bonds
and
he
dumped
them
forth
until
they
covered
the
top
of
the
desk
these
are
my
jewels
he
said
there
millions
represented
here
he
lifted
one
tenderly
and
held
it
to
the
light
fresh
as
it
came
from
the
engraver
press
a
thousand
dollar
bond
of
the
chicago
water
front
and
terminal
company
look
at
that
good
as
gold
if
the
courts
only
knew
the
law
he
took
up
a
yellow
package
of
valueless
obligations
upon
the
top
of
which
an
locomotive
from
whose
funnel
the
smoke
poured
in
picturesque
black
clouds
dragging
behind
it
a
chain
of
funny
little
passenger
coaches
drove
furiously
along
beside
a
rushing
river
through
fields
rich
with
corn
and
wheat
amid
a
border
of
dollar
signs
the
great
lakes
and
canadian
southern
he
crooned
lovingly
the
child
of
my
heart
the
district
attorney
kept
all
the
rest
as
evidence
he
claimed
but
some
day
you
see
he
bring
an
action
against
the
lake
shore
or
the
new
york
central
based
on
these
bonds
yes
sir
all
right
he
pawed
them
over
picking
out
favorites
here
and
there
and
excitedly
extolling
the
merits
of
the
imaginary
properties
they
represented
there
were
the
repudiated
bonds
of
southern
states
and
municipalities
of
railroads
upon
whose
tracks
no
wheel
had
ever
turned
of
factories
never
built
except
in
doc
barrows
addled
brain
of
companies
which
had
defaulted
and
given
stock
for
their
worthless
obligations
certificates
of
oil
mining
and
land
companies
deeds
to
tracts
now
covered
with
sky
scrapers
in
pittsburgh
louis
and
new
york
each
and
every
one
of
them
not
worth
the
paper
they
were
printed
on
except
to
some
crook
who
dealt
in
high
finance
but
they
were
exquisitely
engraved
quite
lovely
to
look
at
and
doc
barrows
gloated
upon
them
with
scintillating
eyes
ai
they
beauties
he
sighed
some
day
yes
sir
some
day
be
worth
real
money
i
paid
it
for
some
of
but
they
yours
all
yours
he
gathered
them
up
with
care
and
returned
them
to
the
suitcase
then
fastened
the
clasps
and
patted
the
leather
cover
with
his
hand
they
are
yours
sir
he
exclaimed
dramatically
as
you
say
agreed
tutt
there
gold
lying
round
everywhere
if
we
only
had
sense
enough
to
look
for
it
but
i
think
you
wise
to
retire
after
all
you
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
your
enterprises
were
sound
even
if
other
people
disagreed
with
you
if
this
was
instead
of
i
own
chicago
began
doc
a
gleam
appearing
in
his
eye
but
they
do
want
to
upset
the
status
quo
that
why
i
have
got
a
fair
chance
but
they
need
worry
be
generous
with
give
easy
terms
long
leases
and
nominal
rents
but
you
like
living
with
your
daughter
i
sure
said
tutt
it
will
make
a
new
man
of
you
in
no
time
healthiest
spot
in
northern
new
york
exclaimed
doc
within
two
miles
of
a
lake
fishing
shooting
outdoor
recreation
of
all
kinds
an
ideal
site
for
a
mammoth
summer
hotel
tutt
rose
and
laid
his
arms
round
old
doc
barrows
shoulders
thank
you
a
thousand
times
he
said
gratefully
for
the
securities
i
be
glad
to
keep
them
for
you
in
my
vault
his
lips
puckered
in
a
stealthy
smile
which
he
tried
hard
to
conceal
louisa
may
want
to
repaper
the
farmhouse
some
time
he
added
to
himself
oh
they
all
yours
to
keep
insisted
doc
i
want
you
to
have
them
his
voice
trembled
well
well
answered
tutt
leave
it
that
way
but
if
you
ever
should
want
them
they
be
here
waiting
for
you
i
no
indian
giver
replied
doc
with
dignity
give
give
give
a
thing
never
take
it
back
again
he
laughed
rather
childishly
he
was
evidently
embarrassed
could
could
you
let
me
have
the
loan
of
cents
he
asked
shyly
down
below
inside
a
doorway
upon
the
other
side
of
the
street
sergeant
murtha
of
the
detective
bureau
waited
for
doc
barrows
to
come
out
and
be
arrested
again
murtha
had
known
doc
for
fifteen
years
as
a
harmless
old
nut
who
had
rarely
succeeded
in
cheating
anybody
but
who
was
regarded
as
generally
undesirable
by
the
authorities
and
sent
away
every
few
years
in
order
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
there
was
no
danger
that
the
public
would
accept
doc
version
of
the
nature
or
value
of
his
securities
but
there
was
always
the
chance
that
some
of
his
worthless
bonds
those
bastard
offsprings
of
his
cracked
old
brain
would
find
their
way
into
less
honest
but
saner
hands
so
doc
rattled
about
from
penitentiary
to
prison
and
from
prison
to
madhouse
and
out
again
constantly
taking
appeals
and
securing
writs
of
habeas
corpus
and
feeling
mildly
resentful
but
not
particularly
so
that
people
should
be
so
interfering
with
his
business
now
as
from
force
of
long
habit
he
peered
out
of
the
doorway
before
making
his
exit
he
looked
like
one
of
the
john
sargent
prophets
gone
a
little
madder
than
usual
a
jeremiah
or
a
habakkuk
hello
doc
called
murtha
in
hearty
friendly
tones
hie
spy
come
on
out
oh
how
d
do
captain
responded
doc
how
are
you
i
was
just
interviewing
my
solicitor
sorry
said
murtha
the
inspector
wants
to
see
you
doc
flinched
but
they
just
let
me
go
he
protested
faintly
it
one
of
those
old
indictments
chicago
water
front
or
something
anyhow
here
hold
on
to
yourself
he
threw
his
arms
around
the
old
man
who
seemed
on
the
point
of
falling
oh
captain
that
all
over
i
served
time
for
that
out
in
illinois
for
some
strange
reason
all
the
insanity
had
gone
out
of
his
bearing
not
in
this
state
answered
murtha
new
pity
for
this
poor
old
wastrel
took
hold
upon
him
what
were
you
going
to
do
i
was
going
to
retire
captain
said
doc
faintly
my
husband
he
owned
a
farm
up
in
cayuga
county
well
he
died
and
i
was
planning
to
go
up
there
and
live
with
her
and
sting
all
the
boobs
grinned
murtha
not
unsympathetically
how
much
money
have
you
got
cents
how
much
is
the
ticket
about
nine
dollars
quavered
doc
but
i
know
a
man
down
on
chatham
square
who
might
buy
a
block
of
stock
in
the
last
chance
gold
mining
company
i
could
get
the
money
that
way
what
the
last
chance
gold
mining
company
asked
murtha
sharply
it
a
company
i
going
to
organize
i
tell
you
a
secret
murtha
there
a
vein
of
gold
runs
right
through
my
daughter
louisa
cow
pasture
she
does
know
anything
about
it
oh
hell
exclaimed
murtha
come
along
to
the
station
i
let
you
have
the
nine
bones
and
you
can
put
me
down
for
half
a
million
of
the
underwriting
that
same
evening
tutt
was
toasting
his
carpet
slippers
before
the
fire
in
his
library
sipping
a
hot
toddy
and
rereading
for
the
eleventh
time
the
lives
of
the
chancellors
when
miranda
who
had
not
yet
finished
washing
the
few
dishes
incident
to
her
master
meager
supper
pushed
open
the
door
and
announced
that
a
lady
was
calling
she
said
you
know
her
sho
enough
mis
tutt
grinned
miranda
swinging
her
dishrag
you
and
she
used
to
live
tergidder
when
you
was
a
young
man
this
scandalous
announcement
did
not
have
the
startling
effect
upon
the
respectable
tutt
which
might
naturally
have
been
anticipated
since
he
was
quite
used
to
miranda
forms
of
expression
it
must
be
effingham
he
remarked
closing
the
career
of
lord
eldon
and
removing
his
feet
from
the
fender
dat
who
it
is
answered
miranda
she
downstairs
waitin
to
come
up
well
let
her
come
directed
tutt
wondering
what
his
old
keeper
could
want
of
him
for
he
had
not
seen
effingham
for
more
than
fifteen
years
at
which
time
she
was
well
provided
with
husband
three
children
and
a
going
business
indeed
it
required
some
mental
adjustment
on
his
part
to
recognize
the
withered
little
old
lady
in
widow
weeds
and
rusty
black
with
a
gold
star
on
her
sleeve
who
so
timidly
a
moment
later
followed
miranda
into
the
room
i
afraid
you
do
recognize
me
she
said
with
a
pitiful
attempt
at
faded
coquetry
i
do
blame
you
tutt
you
do
look
a
day
older
yourself
but
a
great
deal
has
happened
to
me
i
should
have
recognized
you
anywhere
he
protested
gallantly
do
sit
down
effingham
wo
you
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
how
would
you
like
a
glass
of
toddy
just
to
show
there
no
he
forced
a
glass
into
her
hand
and
filled
it
from
the
teakettle
standing
on
the
hearth
while
miranda
brought
a
sofa
cushion
and
tucked
it
behind
the
old
lady
back
effingham
sighed
tasted
the
toddy
and
leaned
back
deliciously
she
was
very
wrinkled
and
her
hair
under
the
bonnet
was
startlingly
white
in
contrast
with
the
crepe
of
her
veil
but
there
were
still
traces
of
beauty
in
her
face
i
come
to
you
tutt
she
explained
apologetically
because
i
always
said
that
if
i
ever
was
in
trouble
you
be
the
one
to
whom
i
should
go
to
help
me
out
what
greater
compliment
could
i
receive
well
in
those
days
i
never
thought
that
time
would
come
she
went
on
you
remember
my
husband
jim
jim
died
two
years
ago
and
little
jimmy
our
eldest
he
was
only
fourteen
when
you
boarded
with
us
he
was
killed
at
the
front
last
july
she
paused
and
felt
for
her
handkerchief
but
could
not
find
it
i
still
keep
the
house
but
do
you
know
how
old
i
am
tutt
i
and
the
two
older
girls
got
married
long
ago
and
i
all
alone
except
for
jessie
the
youngest
and
i
have
told
her
anything
about
it
yes
said
tutt
sympathetically
what
have
you
told
her
about
my
trouble
you
see
jessie
not
a
well
girl
she
really
ought
to
live
out
west
somewhere
the
doctor
says
and
jim
and
i
had
saved
up
all
these
years
so
that
after
we
were
gone
she
would
have
something
to
live
on
we
saved
twelve
thousand
dollars
and
put
it
into
government
bonds
you
could
have
anything
safer
at
any
rate
remarked
the
lawyer
i
think
you
did
exceedingly
well
now
comes
the
awful
part
of
it
all
exclaimed
effingham
clasping
her
hands
i
afraid
it
gone
gone
forever
i
should
have
consulted
you
first
before
i
did
it
but
it
all
seemed
so
fair
and
that
i
never
thought
have
you
got
rid
of
your
bonds
yes
no
that
is
the
bank
has
them
you
see
i
borrowed
ten
thousand
dollars
on
them
and
gave
it
to
badger
to
invest
in
his
oil
company
for
me
tutt
groaned
inwardly
badger
was
the
most
celebrated
of
wall
street
where
on
earth
did
you
meet
badger
he
demanded
why
he
boarded
with
me
for
a
long
time
she
answered
i
no
complaint
to
make
of
badger
he
a
very
handsome
polite
gentleman
and
i
do
feel
altogether
right
about
coming
to
you
and
saying
anything
that
might
be
taken
against
him
but
lately
i
heard
so
many
things
do
worry
about
badger
growled
tutt
how
did
you
come
to
invest
in
his
oil
stock
i
was
there
when
he
got
the
telegram
telling
how
they
had
found
oil
on
the
property
it
came
one
night
at
dinner
he
was
tickled
to
death
the
stock
had
been
selling
at
three
cents
a
share
and
of
course
after
the
oil
was
discovered
he
said
it
would
go
right
up
to
ten
dollars
but
he
was
real
nice
about
it
he
said
anybody
who
had
been
living
there
in
the
house
could
share
his
good
fortune
with
him
come
in
on
the
ground
floor
and
have
it
just
the
same
for
three
cents
a
week
later
there
came
a
photograph
of
the
gusher
and
almost
all
of
us
decided
to
buy
stock
at
this
point
in
the
narrative
tutt
kicked
the
coal
hod
violently
and
uttered
a
smothered
ejaculation
of
course
i
did
have
any
ready
money
explained
effingham
but
i
had
the
bonds
they
only
paid
two
per
cent
and
the
oil
stock
was
going
to
pay
twenty
and
so
i
took
them
down
to
the
bank
and
borrowed
ten
thousand
dollars
on
them
i
had
to
sign
a
note
and
pay
five
per
cent
interest
i
was
making
the
difference
fifteen
hundred
dollars
every
year
what
has
it
paid
demanded
tutt
ironically
twenty
per
cent
replied
effingham
i
get
badger
check
regularly
every
six
months
how
many
times
have
you
got
it
twice
well
why
do
you
like
your
investment
inquired
tutt
blandly
i
like
something
that
would
pay
me
twenty
per
cent
a
year
because
i
afraid
badger
is
quite
truthful
and
one
of
the
ladies
that
old
channing
you
remember
her
do
you
the
one
with
the
curls
she
tried
to
sell
her
stock
and
nobody
would
make
a
bid
on
it
at
all
and
when
she
spoke
to
badger
about
it
he
became
very
angry
and
swore
right
in
front
of
her
then
somebody
told
me
that
badger
had
been
arrested
once
for
something
and
and
oh
i
wish
i
had
given
him
the
money
because
if
it
lost
jessie
wo
have
anything
to
live
on
after
i
dead
and
she
too
sick
to
work
what
do
you
think
tutt
do
you
suppose
badger
would
buy
the
stock
back
tutt
smiled
grimly
not
if
i
know
him
have
you
got
your
stock
with
you
she
nodded
fumbling
in
her
black
bag
she
pulled
forth
a
flaring
certificate
of
the
regulation
kind
not
even
engraved
which
evidenced
that
sarah
maria
ann
effingham
was
the
legal
owner
of
three
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
shares
of
the
capital
stock
of
the
great
geyser
texan
petroleum
and
llano
estacado
land
company
tutt
took
it
gingerly
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
it
was
signed
alfred
haynes
badger
and
he
had
an
almost
irresistible
temptation
to
twist
it
into
a
spill
and
light
a
stogy
with
it
but
he
used
a
match
instead
while
effingham
watched
him
apprehensively
then
he
handed
the
stock
back
to
her
and
poured
out
another
glass
of
toddy
ever
been
in
badger
office
oh
yes
she
answered
it
a
lovely
office
you
can
see
down
the
harbor
and
over
to
new
jersey
it
real
elegant
would
you
mind
going
there
again
that
is
are
you
on
friendly
terms
with
him
already
a
strange
rather
desperate
plan
was
half
formulated
in
his
mind
oh
we
perfectly
friendly
she
smiled
i
generally
go
down
there
to
get
my
check
whose
check
is
it
his
or
the
company
i
really
do
know
she
answered
simply
what
difference
would
it
make
oh
nothing
except
that
he
might
claim
that
he
loaned
you
the
money
loaned
it
to
me
why
yes
one
hears
of
such
things
but
it
is
my
money
she
cried
stiffening
you
paid
that
for
the
stock
she
shook
her
head
helplessly
i
do
understand
these
things
she
murmured
if
jim
had
been
alive
it
would
have
happened
he
was
so
careful
husbands
have
some
uses
occasionally
suddenly
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
oh
tutt
please
get
the
money
back
from
him
if
you
something
terrible
will
happen
to
jessie
i
do
my
best
he
said
gently
laying
his
hand
on
her
fragile
shoulder
but
i
may
not
be
able
to
do
it
and
anyhow
i
need
your
help
what
can
i
do
i
want
you
to
go
down
to
badger
office
morning
and
tell
him
that
you
are
so
much
pleased
with
your
investment
that
you
would
like
to
turn
all
your
securities
over
to
him
to
sell
and
put
the
money
into
the
great
geyser
texan
petroleum
and
llano
estacado
land
company
he
rolled
out
the
words
with
unction
but
i
do
oh
yes
you
do
he
assured
her
you
want
to
do
just
what
i
tell
you
do
you
of
course
she
answered
but
i
thought
you
did
like
oil
company
whether
i
like
it
or
not
makes
no
difference
i
want
you
to
say
just
what
i
tell
you
oh
very
well
mr
tutt
then
you
must
tell
him
about
the
note
and
that
first
it
will
have
to
be
paid
off
yes
and
then
you
must
hand
him
a
letter
which
i
will
dictate
to
you
now
she
flushed
slightly
her
eyes
bright
with
excitement
you
sure
it
perfectly
honest
tutt
i
would
want
to
do
anything
unfair
would
you
be
honest
with
a
burglar
but
badger
is
a
burglar
no
he
only
about
a
thousand
times
worse
he
a
robber
of
widows
and
orphans
he
is
man
enough
to
take
a
chance
at
housebreaking
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
sighed
where
shall
i
write
tutt
cleared
a
space
upon
his
desk
handed
her
a
pad
and
dipped
a
pen
in
the
ink
while
she
took
off
her
gloves
address
the
note
to
the
bank
he
directed
she
did
so
now
say
deliver
to
badger
all
the
securities
i
have
on
deposit
with
you
whenever
he
pays
my
note
very
truly
yours
sarah
maria
ann
effingham
but
i
do
want
him
to
have
my
securities
she
retorted
oh
you
wo
mind
you
be
lucky
to
get
badger
to
take
back
your
oil
stock
on
any
terms
leave
the
certificate
with
me
laughed
tutt
rubbing
his
long
thin
hands
together
almost
gleefully
and
now
as
it
is
getting
rather
late
perhaps
you
will
do
me
the
honor
of
letting
me
escort
you
home
it
was
midnight
before
tutt
went
to
bed
in
the
first
place
he
had
felt
himself
so
neglectful
of
effingham
that
after
he
had
taken
her
home
he
had
sat
there
a
long
time
talking
over
the
old
lady
affairs
and
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
phthisical
jessie
who
turned
out
to
be
a
wistful
little
creature
with
great
liquid
eyes
and
a
delicate
transparent
skin
that
foretold
only
too
clearly
what
was
to
be
her
future
there
was
only
one
place
for
her
tutt
told
himself
arizona
and
by
the
grace
of
god
she
should
go
there
badger
or
no
badger
as
the
old
lawyer
walked
slowly
home
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
he
pondered
upon
the
seeming
mockery
and
injustice
of
the
law
that
forced
a
lonely
old
fellow
with
the
fixed
delusion
that
he
was
a
financier
behind
prison
bars
and
left
free
the
sharp
slick
crook
who
had
no
bowels
or
mercies
and
would
snatch
away
the
mite
and
leave
her
and
her
consumptive
daughter
to
die
in
the
poorhouse
yet
such
was
the
case
and
there
they
all
were
could
you
blame
people
for
being
bolsheviks
and
yet
old
doc
barrows
was
as
far
from
a
bolshevik
as
anyone
could
well
be
tutt
passed
a
restless
night
dreaming
when
he
slept
at
all
of
mines
from
which
poured
myriads
of
pieces
of
yellow
gold
of
gushers
spouting
columns
of
oil
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
air
and
of
locomotives
dragging
picturesque
trains
of
cars
across
bright
green
prairies
studded
with
cacti
in
the
shape
of
dollar
signs
old
doc
barrows
was
with
him
and
from
time
to
time
he
would
lean
toward
him
and
whisper
listen
tutt
i
tell
you
a
secret
there
a
vein
of
gold
runs
right
through
my
daughter
cow
pasture
when
willie
next
morning
at
half
past
eight
reached
the
office
he
found
the
door
already
unlocked
and
tutt
busy
at
his
desk
up
to
his
elbows
in
a
great
mass
of
bonds
and
stock
certificates
gee
he
exclaimed
to
miss
sondheim
the
stenographer
when
she
made
her
appearance
at
a
quarter
past
nine
just
peek
in
the
old
man
door
if
you
want
to
feel
rich
say
he
must
ha
struck
pay
dirt
i
wonder
if
we
all
get
a
raise
but
all
the
securities
on
tutt
desk
would
not
have
justified
even
the
modest
advance
of
five
dollars
in
miss
sondheim
salary
and
their
employer
was
merely
sorting
out
and
making
an
inventory
of
doc
imaginary
wealth
by
the
time
effingham
arrived
by
appointment
at
ten
he
had
them
all
arranged
and
labeled
and
in
a
special
bundle
neatly
tied
with
a
piece
of
red
tape
were
what
on
their
face
were
securities
worth
upward
of
seventy
thousand
dollars
there
were
ten
of
the
beautiful
bonds
of
the
great
lakes
and
canadian
southern
railroad
company
with
their
miniature
locomotives
and
fields
of
wheat
and
ten
equally
lovely
bits
of
engraving
belonging
to
the
defunct
bluff
creek
and
iowa
central
ten
more
superb
lithographs
issued
by
the
mohawk
and
housatonic
in
and
paid
off
in
and
a
variety
of
gorgeous
chromos
of
indians
and
buffaloes
and
of
factories
and
steamships
spouting
clouds
of
smoke
and
on
the
top
of
all
was
a
pile
of
the
first
mortgage
gold
six
per
cent
obligations
of
the
chicago
water
front
and
terminal
company
all
of
them
fresh
and
crisp
with
that
faintly
acrid
smell
which
though
not
agreeable
to
the
nostrils
nevertheless
delights
the
banker
soul
ah
good
morning
to
you
mrs
effingham
tutt
cried
waving
her
in
when
that
lady
was
announced
you
are
not
the
only
millionaire
you
see
in
fact
i
stumbled
into
a
few
barrels
of
securities
myself
only
i
did
pay
anything
for
them
gracious
cried
effingham
her
eyes
lighting
with
astonishment
wherever
did
you
get
them
and
such
exquisite
pictures
look
at
that
lamb
it
ought
to
have
been
a
wolf
muttered
tutt
well
effingham
i
decided
to
make
you
a
present
just
a
few
pounds
of
chicago
water
front
and
canadian
southern
those
over
there
in
that
pile
and
now
if
you
say
so
we
just
go
along
to
your
bank
give
them
to
me
she
protested
what
on
earth
for
you
joking
mr
tutt
not
a
bit
of
it
he
retorted
i
do
make
any
pretensions
as
to
the
value
of
my
gift
but
they
yours
for
whatever
they
worth
he
wrapped
them
carefully
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
returned
the
balance
to
doc
barrows
case
are
you
afraid
to
leave
them
that
way
she
asked
surprised
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
laughed
you
see
there
are
fortunes
lying
all
about
us
everywhere
if
we
only
know
where
to
look
now
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
get
your
bonds
back
from
the
bank
thomas
mckeever
the
popular
loan
clerk
of
the
mustardseed
national
was
just
getting
ready
for
the
annual
visit
of
the
state
bank
examiner
when
tutt
followed
by
effingham
entered
the
exquisitely
furnished
boudoir
where
lady
clients
were
induced
by
all
modern
conveniences
except
manicures
and
shower
baths
to
become
depositors
tutt
and
mckeever
belonged
to
the
same
saturday
evening
poker
game
at
the
colophon
club
familiarly
known
as
the
bible
class
morning
tom
said
tutt
this
is
my
client
effingham
you
hold
her
note
i
believe
for
ten
thousand
dollars
secured
by
some
government
bonds
she
has
a
use
for
those
bonds
and
i
thought
that
you
might
be
willing
to
take
my
indorsement
instead
you
know
i
good
for
the
money
why
i
guess
we
can
accommodate
her
mr
tutt
answered
the
chesterfieldian
mckeever
certainly
we
can
sit
down
effingham
while
i
send
for
your
bonds
see
the
morning
paper
effingham
blushingly
acknowledged
that
she
had
not
seen
the
paper
in
fact
she
was
much
too
excited
to
see
anything
sign
here
said
the
loan
clerk
placing
the
note
before
the
lawyer
tutt
indorsed
it
in
his
strange
humpbacked
chirography
here
are
your
bonds
said
mckeever
handing
effingham
a
small
package
in
a
manila
envelope
she
took
them
in
a
way
as
if
she
thought
she
was
doing
something
wrong
and
now
said
tutt
the
lady
would
like
a
box
in
your
vaults
a
small
one
about
five
dollars
a
year
will
do
she
has
quite
a
bundle
of
securities
with
her
which
i
am
looking
into
most
if
not
all
of
them
are
of
little
or
no
value
but
i
have
told
her
she
might
just
as
well
leave
them
as
security
for
what
they
are
worth
in
addition
to
my
indorsement
really
it
just
a
slick
game
of
ours
to
get
the
bank
to
look
after
them
for
nothing
is
it
mrs
effingham
stammered
effingham
not
understanding
what
he
was
talking
about
well
answered
mckeever
we
never
refuse
collateral
i
put
the
bonds
with
the
note
his
eye
caught
the
edges
of
the
bundle
great
scott
tutt
what
are
you
leaving
all
these
bonds
here
for
against
that
note
there
must
be
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
dol
i
thought
you
never
refused
collateral
mr
mckeever
challenged
tutt
sternly
twenty
minutes
later
the
exquisite
blonde
that
acted
as
financial
accomplice
learned
from
effingham
faltering
lips
that
the
widow
would
like
to
see
the
great
man
in
regard
to
further
investments
how
does
it
look
mabel
inquired
the
financier
from
behind
his
massive
mahogany
desk
covered
with
a
six
by
five
sheet
of
plate
glass
is
it
a
squeal
or
a
fall
easy
money
answered
mabel
with
confidence
she
wants
to
put
a
mortgage
on
the
farm
keep
her
about
fourteen
minutes
tell
her
the
story
of
my
philanthropies
and
then
shoot
her
in
directed
badger
so
effingham
listened
politely
while
mabel
showed
her
the
photographs
of
badger
home
for
consumptives
out
in
tyrone
new
mexico
and
of
his
wife
and
children
taken
on
the
porch
of
his
summer
home
at
seabright
new
jersey
and
then
exactly
fourteen
minutes
having
elapsed
she
was
shot
in
ah
effingham
delighted
do
be
seated
badger
smile
was
like
that
of
the
boa
constrictor
about
to
swallow
the
rabbit
about
my
oil
stock
hesitated
effingham
well
what
about
it
demanded
badger
sharply
are
you
dissatisfied
with
your
twenty
per
cent
oh
no
stammered
the
old
lady
not
at
all
i
just
thought
if
i
could
only
get
the
note
paid
off
at
the
mustardseed
bank
i
might
ask
you
to
sell
the
collateral
and
invest
the
proceeds
in
your
gusher
oh
badger
beamed
with
pleasure
do
you
really
wish
to
have
me
dispose
of
your
securities
for
you
he
did
not
regard
it
as
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
the
collateral
if
it
was
satisfactory
to
the
mustardseed
national
it
must
of
course
exceed
considerably
the
amount
of
the
note
yes
answered
effingham
timidly
and
she
handed
him
the
letter
dictated
by
tutt
well
replied
badger
thoughtfully
after
reading
it
what
you
ask
is
rather
unusual
quite
unusual
i
may
say
but
i
think
i
may
be
able
to
attend
to
the
matter
for
you
leave
it
in
my
hands
and
think
no
more
about
it
how
have
you
been
my
dear
effingham
you
looking
extraordinarily
well
mckeever
had
about
concluded
his
arrangements
for
welcoming
the
state
bank
examiner
when
the
telephone
on
his
desk
buzzed
and
on
taking
up
the
receiver
he
heard
the
ingratiating
voice
of
alfred
haynes
badger
is
this
the
loan
department
of
the
mustardseed
national
it
is
he
answered
shortly
i
understand
you
hold
a
note
of
a
certain
effingham
for
ten
thousand
dollars
may
i
ask
if
it
is
secured
who
is
this
snapped
mckeever
one
of
her
friends
replied
badger
amicably
well
we
do
discuss
our
clients
affairs
over
the
telephone
you
had
better
come
in
here
if
you
have
any
inquiries
to
make
but
i
want
to
pay
the
note
expostulated
badger
oh
well
anybody
can
pay
the
note
who
wants
to
and
of
course
in
that
case
you
would
turn
over
whatever
collateral
is
on
deposit
to
secure
the
note
if
we
were
so
directed
may
i
ask
what
collateral
there
is
i
do
know
there
is
some
collateral
i
suppose
yes
well
i
have
an
order
from
effingham
directing
the
bank
to
turn
over
whatever
securities
she
has
on
deposit
as
collateral
on
my
payment
of
the
note
in
that
case
you
get
said
mckeever
gruffly
i
get
them
out
and
have
ready
for
you
here
is
my
certified
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
announced
alfred
haynes
badger
a
few
minutes
later
and
here
is
the
order
from
effingham
now
will
you
kindly
turn
over
to
me
all
the
securities
mckeever
knowing
something
of
the
reputation
of
badger
first
called
up
the
bank
which
had
certified
the
latter
check
and
having
ascertained
that
the
certification
was
genuine
he
marked
effingham
note
as
paid
and
then
took
down
from
the
top
of
his
desk
the
bundle
of
beautifully
engraved
securities
given
him
by
tutt
badger
watched
him
greedily
thank
you
he
gurgled
stuffing
them
into
his
pocket
much
obliged
for
your
courtesy
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
open
an
account
here
oh
anybody
can
open
an
account
who
wants
to
remarked
mckeever
dryly
turning
away
from
him
to
something
else
badger
fairly
flew
back
to
his
office
the
exquisite
blonde
had
hardly
ever
before
seen
him
exhibit
so
much
agitation
what
have
you
pulled
this
time
she
inquired
dreamily
daguerreotype
and
the
bracelet
of
mother
hair
i
grabbed
off
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
he
cried
look
at
we
not
seen
so
much
of
the
real
stuff
in
six
months
ten
twenty
thirty
forty
fifty
by
gad
sixty
seventy
what
are
they
asked
mabel
curiously
some
bonds
what
i
should
say
so
he
retorted
gaily
say
girlie
i
give
you
the
swellest
meal
of
your
young
life
chicago
water
front
and
terminal
great
lakes
and
canadian
southern
mohawk
and
housatonic
bluff
creek
and
iowa
central
it
was
at
just
about
this
period
of
the
celebration
that
tutt
entered
the
outer
office
and
sent
in
his
name
and
as
badger
was
at
the
height
of
his
good
humor
he
condescended
to
see
him
i
have
called
said
tutt
in
regard
to
the
bonds
belonging
to
my
client
effingham
i
see
you
have
them
on
the
desk
there
in
front
of
you
unfortunately
she
has
changed
her
mind
she
has
decided
not
to
have
you
dispose
of
her
securities
badger
expression
instantly
became
hostile
and
defiant
it
too
late
he
replied
i
have
paid
off
her
note
and
i
am
going
to
carry
out
the
rest
of
the
arrangement
oh
said
tutt
so
you
are
going
to
sell
all
her
securities
and
put
the
proceeds
into
your
bogus
oil
company
whether
she
wishes
it
or
not
if
you
do
the
district
attorney
will
get
after
you
i
stand
on
my
rights
snarled
badger
anyhow
i
can
sell
enough
of
the
securities
to
pay
myself
back
my
ten
thousand
dollars
and
then
you
steal
the
rest
inquired
tutt
be
careful
my
dear
sir
remember
there
is
such
a
thing
as
equity
and
such
a
place
as
sing
sing
badger
gave
a
cynical
laugh
you
too
late
my
friend
i
got
a
written
order
written
from
your
client
as
you
call
her
she
ca
go
back
on
it
now
i
got
the
bonds
and
i
going
to
dispose
of
them
very
well
said
tutt
tolerantly
you
can
do
as
you
see
fit
but
and
he
produced
ten
genuine
bills
and
exhibited
them
to
badger
at
a
safe
distance
i
now
on
behalf
of
effingham
make
you
a
legal
tender
of
the
ten
thousand
dollars
you
have
just
paid
out
to
cancel
her
note
and
i
demand
the
return
of
the
securities
incidentally
i
beg
to
inform
you
that
they
are
not
worth
the
paper
they
are
printed
on
indeed
sneered
badger
well
my
dear
old
friend
you
might
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
of
coming
round
here
you
and
your
client
can
go
straight
to
hell
can
keep
the
money
keep
the
bonds
see
tutt
sighed
and
shook
his
head
hopelessly
then
he
put
the
bills
back
into
his
pocket
and
started
slowly
for
the
door
you
absolutely
and
finally
decline
to
give
up
the
securities
he
asked
plaintively
absolutely
and
finally
mocked
badger
with
a
sweeping
bow
dear
dear
almost
moaned
tutt
i
heard
of
you
a

many
times
but
i
never
realized
before

an
unscrupulous

you
were

glad
to
have
had

save
by
the

or
by

magna

the
three

one
of
the
nicest
men
in
new
york
was
john
de
puyster
hepplewhite
the
chief
reason
for
his
niceness
was
his
entire
satisfaction
with
himself
and
the
padded
world
in
which
he
dwelt
where
he
was
as
protected
from
all
shocking
rough
or
otherwise
unpleasant
things
as
a
shrinking
débutante
from
the
coarse
universe
of
fact
being
thus
shielded
from
every
annoyance
and
irritation
by
a
host
of
sycophants
he
lived
serenely
in
an
atmosphere
of
unruffled
calm
gazing
down
benignly
and
with
a
certain
condescension
from
the
rarefied
altitude
of
his
fifth
avenue
windows
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
life
as
it
appeared
to
him
to
be
and
only
slightly
conscious
of
the
vileness
of
his
fellow
man
certainly
he
was
not
conscious
at
all
of
the
existence
of
the
celebrated
law
firm
of
tutt
tutt
such
vulgar
persons
were
not
of
his
sphere
his
own
lawyers
were
dignified
rather
smart
attorneys
who
moved
only
in
the
best
social
circles
and
practised
their
profession
with
an
air
of
elegance
when
hepplewhite
needed
advice
he
sent
for
them
and
they
came
chatted
a
while
in
subdued
easy
accents
and
went
away
like
cheerful
undertakers
nobody
ever
spoke
in
loud
tones
near
hepplewhite
because
hepplewhite
did
not
like
anything
loud
not
even
clothes
he
was
as
we
have
said
quite
one
of
the
nicest
men
in
new
york
at
the
moment
when
witherspoon
made
her
appearance
he
was
sitting
in
his
library
reading
a
copy
of
and
waiting
for
bibby
the
butler
to
announce
tea
it
was
eight
minutes
to
five
and
there
was
still
eight
minutes
to
wait
so
hepplewhite
went
on
reading
then
mrs
witherspoon
intoned
bibby
and
hepplewhite
rose
quickly
adjusted
his
and
came
punctiliously
forward
my
dear
mrs
witherspoon
he
exclaimed
crisply
i
am
really
delighted
to
see
you
it
was
quite
charming
of
you
to
give
me
this
adorable
of
you
to
ask
me
mr
hepplewhite
returned
the
lady
been
looking
forward
to
this
visit
for
weeks
what
a
sweet
room
is
that
a
corot
yes
yes
murmured
her
host
modestly
rather
nice
i
think
eh
show
you
my
few
belongings
after
tea
now
will
you
go
upstairs
first
or
have
tea
first
just
as
you
say
beamed
witherspoon
perhaps
i
had
better
run
up
and
take
off
my
veil
whichever
you
prefer
he
replied
chivalrously
do
exactly
as
you
like
tea
will
be
ready
in
a
couple
of
minutes
then
i
think
i
run
up
very
well
bibby
show
witherspoon
very
good
sir
this
way
please
madam
stockin
fetch
witherspoon
bag
from
the
hall
hepplewhite
stood
rubbing
his
delicate
hands
in
front
of
the
fire
telling
himself
what
a
really
great
pleasure
it
was
to
have
witherspoon
staying
with
him
over
the
he
was
having
a
dinner
party
for
her
that
evening
of
all
that
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
do
to
have
the
party
was
to
tell
sadducee
his
secretary
that
he
wished
to
have
it
and
direct
him
to
send
the
invitations
from
list
number
one
and
then
to
tell
bibby
the
same
thing
and
to
order
the
chef
to
serve
dinner
number
four
only
to
have
johannisberger
cabinet
instead
of
niersteiner
all
these
things
were
highly
important
to
hepplewhite
for
upon
the
absolute
smoothness
with
which
tea
and
dinner
were
served
and
the
accuracy
with
which
his
valet
selected
socks
to
match
his
tie
his
entire
happiness
to
say
nothing
of
his
peace
of
mind
depended
his
daily
life
consisted
of
a
series
of
subdued
and
nicely
adjusted
social
events
they
were
forecast
for
months
ahead
nothing
was
ever
done
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
at
hepplewhite
he
could
tell
to
within
a
couple
of
seconds
just
exactly
what
was
going
to
occur
during
the
balance
of
the
day
the
remainder
of
witherspoon
stay
and
the
rest
of
the
month
it
would
have
upset
him
very
much
not
to
know
exactly
what
was
going
to
happen
for
he
was
a
meticulously
careful
host
and
being
a
creature
of
habit
the
unexpected
was
apt
to
agitate
him
extremely
so
now
as
he
stood
rubbing
his
hands
it
was
in
the
absolute
certainty
that
in
just
a
few
more
seconds
one
of
the
footmen
would
appear
between
the
tapestry
portières
bearing
aloft
a
silver
tray
with
the
tea
things
and
then
bibby
would
come
in
with
the
paper
and
presently
witherspoon
would
come
down
and
she
would
make
tea
for
him
and
they
would
talk
about
tea
and
aiken
and
whether
the
abner
fullertons
were
going
to
get
a
domestic
or
foreign
divorce
and
how
his
bridge
was
these
days
it
would
be
very
nice
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
very
gently
and
waited
for
the
dresden
clock
to
strike
five
in
the
subdued
and
decorous
way
that
it
had
but
he
did
not
hear
it
strike
instead
a
shriek
rang
out
from
the
hall
above
followed
by
yells
and
feet
pounding
down
the
stairs
hepplewhite
turned
cold
and
something
hard
rose
up
in
his
throat
his
sight
dimmed
and
then
bibby
burst
in
pale
and
with
protruding
eyes
there
was
a
man
in
the
guest
room
he
gasped
stockin
got
him
what
shall
we
do
at
that
moment
witherspoon
followed
oh
hepplewhite
oh
mr
hepplewhite
she
gasped
staggering
toward
him
hepplewhite
would
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
attempted
to
comfort
her
only
it
was
not
done
in
hepplewhite
set
unless
under
extreme
provocation
so
he
pressed
an
armchair
upon
her
or
rather
pressed
her
into
an
armchair
and
leaned
against
the
bookcase
feeling
very
faint
he
was
extremely
agitated
for
the
police
for
he
stuttered
burk
was
a
husky
watchman
who
also
acted
as
a
personal
guard
for
hepplewhite
an
alarm
began
to
beat
a
deafening
staccato
in
the
hall
outside
the
library
bibby
rushed
gurgling
from
the
room
several
tall
men
in
knee
breeches
and
silk
stockings
dashed
excitedly
up
and
down
stairs
using
expressions
such
as
had
never
before
been
heard
by
hepplewhite
and
the
clanging
gong
of
a
police
wagon
was
audible
as
it
clattered
up
the
avenue
oh
hepplewhite
whispered
witherspoon
unconsciously
seeking
his
hand
i
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
life
then
the
gong
stopped
and
the
police
poured
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
there
were
muffled
noises
and
suppressed
ejaculations
of
aw
come
on
there
now
i
got
him
mike
no
funny
business
now
you
come
along
quiet
the
whole
house
seemed
blue
with
policemen
and
hepplewhite
became
aware
of
a
very
fat
man
in
a
blue
cap
marked
captain
who
removed
the
cap
deferentially
and
otherwise
indicated
that
he
was
making
obeisance
behind
the
fat
man
stood
three
other
equally
fat
men
who
held
between
them
with
grim
firmness
by
arm
neck
and
shoulder
a
much
smaller
in
fact
quite
a
small
man
shabby
unkempt
and
with
a
desperate
look
upon
his
unshaven
face
we
got
him
all
right
mr
hepplewhite
exulted
the
captain
obviously
grateful
that
god
had
vouchsafed
to
deliver
the
criminal
into
his
and
not
into
other
hands
shall
i
take
him
to
the
house
or
do
you
want
to
examine
him
i
ejaculated
hepplewhite
mercy
no
take
him
away
as
quickly
as
possible
as
you
say
sir
wheezed
the
captain
come
along
boys
take
him
over
to
court
and
arraign
him
yes
do
urged
witherspoon
and
arraign
him
as
hard
as
you
can
for
he
really
frightened
me
nearly
to
death
the
terrible
man
leave
him
to
me
adjured
the
captain
will
you
have
your
butler
act
as
complainant
sir
he
asked
why
yes
bibby
will
do
whatever
is
proper
agreed
hepplewhite
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
go
to
court
will
it
oh
no
answered
the
captain
bibby
will
do
all
right
i
suppose
we
had
better
make
the
charge
burglary
sir
i
suppose
so
replied
hepplewhite
vaguely
get
on
boys
ordered
the
captain
good
evening
sir
good
evening
step
lively
you
the
blue
cloud
faded
away
bearing
with
it
both
bibby
and
the
burglar
then
the
third
footman
brought
the
belated
tea
what
a
frightful
thing
to
have
happen
grieved
witherspoon
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
for
hepplewhite
you
do
take
cream
do
you
no
thanks
he
answered
i
find
too
much
cream
hard
to
digest
i
have
to
be
rather
careful
you
know
by
the
way
you
have
told
me
where
the
burglar
was
or
what
he
was
doing
when
you
went
into
the
room
he
was
in
the
bed
said
witherspoon
in
the
of
lying
tutt
said
tutt
thoughtfully
as
he
dropped
in
for
a
moment
chat
after
lunch
oscar
wilde
says
is
no
essential
incongruity
between
crime
and
culture
the
senior
partner
removed
his
spectacles
and
carefully
polished
the
lenses
with
a
bit
of
chamois
which
he
produced
from
his
watch
pocket
meanwhile
resting
the
muscles
of
his
forehead
by
elevating
his
eyebrows
until
he
somewhat
resembled
an
inquiring
but
owl
that
plain
enough
he
replied
the
most
highly
cultivated
people
are
often
the
most
unscrupulous
i
go
oscar
one
better
and
declare
that
there
is
a
distinct
relationship
between
crime
and
progress
you
do
say
now
ejaculated
tutt
how
do
you
make
that
out
tutt
readjusted
his
spectacles
and
slowly
selected
a
stogy
from
the
bundle
in
the
dusty
old
cigar
box
crime
he
announced
is
the
violation
of
the
will
of
the
majority
as
expressed
in
the
statutes
the
law
is
wholly
arbitrary
and
depends
upon
public
opinion
acts
which
are
crimes
in
one
century
or
country
become
virtues
in
another
and
vice
versa
moreover
there
is
no
difference
except
one
of
degree
between
infractions
of
etiquette
and
of
law
each
of
which
expresses
the
feelings
and
ideas
of
society
at
a
given
moment
violations
of
good
taste
manners
morals
illegalities
wrongs
crimes
they
are
all
fundamentally
the
same
thing
the
insistence
on
one
own
will
in
defiance
of
society
as
a
whole
the
man
who
keeps
his
hat
on
in
a
is
essentially
a
criminal
because
he
prefers
his
own
way
of
doing
things
to
that
adopted
by
his
fellows
that
all
right
answered
tutt
but
how
about
progress
why
that
is
simple
replied
his
partner
the
man
who
refuses
to
bow
to
habit
tradition
law
who
thinks
for
himself
and
acts
for
himself
who
evolves
new
theories
who
has
the
courage
of
his
convictions
and
stakes
his
life
and
liberty
upon
them
that
man
is
either
a
statesman
a
prophet
or
a
criminal
and
in
the
end
he
is
either
hailed
as
a
hero
and
a
liberator
or
is
burned
cast
into
prison
or
crucified
tutt
looked
interested
well
now
he
returned
helping
himself
from
the
box
i
never
thought
of
it
but
of
course
it
true
your
proposition
is
that
progress
depends
on
development
and
development
depends
on
new
ideas
if
the
new
idea
is
contrary
to
those
of
society
it
is
probably
criminal
if
its
inventor
puts
it
across
gets
away
with
it
and
persuades
society
that
he
is
right
he
is
a
leader
in
the
march
of
progress
if
he
fails
he
goes
to
jail
hence
the
relationship
between
crime
and
progress
why
not
say
that
crime
is
progress
if
successful
it
is
answered
tutt
but
the
moment
it
is
successful
it
ceases
to
be
crime
i
get
you
nodded
tutt
here
it
is
a
crime
to
kill
grandmother
but
i
recall
reading
that
among
certain
savage
tribes
to
do
so
is
regarded
as
a
highly
virtuous
act
now
if
i
convince
society
that
to
kill
one
grandmother
is
a
good
thing
it
ceases
to
be
a
crime
society
has
progressed
i
am
a
public
benefactor
and
if
you
do
persuade
society
you
go
to
the
chair
remarked
tutt
laconically
to
use
another
illustration
exclaimed
tutt
warming
to
the
subject
the
private
ownership
of
property
at
the
present
time
is
recognized
and
protected
by
the
law
but
if
we
had
a
bolshevik
government
it
might
be
a
crime
to
refuse
to
share
one
property
with
others
in
that
case
if
you
took
your
share
of
another
property
by
force
instead
of
being
a
thief
you
would
be
a
progressive
smiled
his
partner
tutt
robbed
his
forehead
looking
at
it
that
way
you
know
said
he
makes
it
seem
as
if
criminals
were
rather
to
be
admired
well
some
of
them
are
and
a
great
multitude
of
them
certainly
were
answered
tutt
all
the
early
christian
martyrs
were
criminals
in
the
sense
that
they
were
and
martin
luther
suggested
tutt
and
garibaldi
added
tutt
and
george
washington
maybe
hazarded
the
junior
partner
tutt
shrugged
his
high
shoulders
you
press
the
analogy
a
long
way
but
in
a
sense
every
successful
revolutionist
was
in
the
beginning
a
criminal
as
every
rebel
is
and
perforce
must
be
he
replied
so
said
tutt
if
you
a
big
enough
criminal
you
cease
to
be
a
criminal
at
all
if
you
going
to
be
a
crook
do
be
a
piker
too
risky
grab
everything
in
sight
exterminate
a
whole
nation
if
possible
do
be
a
common
garden
highwayman
or
pirate
be
a
napoleon
or
a
willy
hohenzollern
you
have
the
idea
replied
tutt
crime
is
unsuccessful
defiance
of
the
existing
order
of
things
once
rebellion
rises
to
the
dignity
of
revolution
murder
becomes
execution
and
the
murderers
become
belligerents
therefore
as
all
real
progress
involves
a
change
in
or
defiance
of
existing
law
those
who
advocate
progress
are
essentially
criminally
minded
and
if
they
attempt
to
secure
progress
by
openly
refusing
to
obey
the
law
they
are
actual
criminals
then
if
they
prevail
and
from
being
in
the
minority
come
into
power
they
are
taken
out
of
jail
banquets
are
given
in
their
honor
and
they
are
called
patriots
and
heroes
hence
the
close
connection
between
crime
and
progress
tutt
scratched
his
chin
doubtfully
that
sounds
pretty
good
he
admitted
but
and
he
shook
his
head
there
something
the
matter
with
it
it
does
work
except
in
the
case
of
crimes
involving
personal
rights
and
liberties
i
see
your
point
that
all
progressives
are
criminals
in
the
sense
that
they
are
the
law
as
it
is
but
i
also
see
the
hole
in
your
argument
which
is
that
the
fact
that
all
progressives
are
criminals
does
make
all
criminals
progressive
your
proposition
is
only
a
half
truth
you
quite
wrong
about
my
theory
being
a
half
truth
retorted
tutt
it
is
fundamentally
sound
the
fellow
who
steals
a
razor
or
a
few
dollars
is
regarded
as
a
mean
thief
but
if
he
loots
a
trust
company
or
takes
a
million
he
a
financier
the
criminal
law
i
maintain
is
administered
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
strong
from
the
weak
the
successful
from
the
unsuccessful
the
rich
from
the
poor
and
sir
tutt
here
shook
his
fist
at
an
imaginary
jury
the
man
who
wears
a
red
necktie
in
violation
of
the
taste
of
his
community
or
eats
peas
with
his
knife
is
just
as
much
a
criminal
as
a
man
who
spits
on
the
floor
when
there
a
law
against
it
do
you
agree
with
me
i
do
not
replied
tutt
but
that
makes
no
difference
nevertheless
what
you
say
about
the
criminal
law
being
devised
to
protect
the
rich
from
the
poor
interests
me
very
much
very
much
indeed
but
i
think
there
a
flaw
in
that
argument
too
is
there
your
proposition
is
true
only
to
the
extent
that
the
criminal
law
is
invoked
to
protect
property
rights
and
not
life
and
liberty
naturally
the
laws
that
protect
property
are
chiefly
of
benefit
to
those
who
have
it
the
rich
however
that
may
be
declared
tutt
fiercely
i
claim
that
the
criminal
laws
are
administered
interpreted
and
construed
in
favor
of
the
rich
as
against
the
liberties
of
the
poor
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
administrators
of
the
criminal
law
desire
to
curry
favor
with
the
powers
that
be
the
moral
of
which
all
is
retorted
the
other
that
the
law
ought
to
be
very
careful
about
locking
up
people
at
any
rate
those
who
have
violated
laws
upon
which
there
can
be
a
legitimate
difference
of
opinion
agreed
tutt
that
where
we
come
in
said
tutt
we
make
the
difference
even
if
there
never
was
any
before
tutt
chuckled
we
perform
a
dual
service
to
society
he
declared
we
prevent
the
law
from
making
mistakes
and
so
keep
it
from
falling
into
disrepute
and
we
show
up
its
weak
points
and
thus
enable
it
to
be
improved
and
incidentally
we
keep
many
a
future
statesman
and
prophet
from
going
to
prison
said
tutt
the
name
of
the
last
one
was
solomon
rabinovitch
and
he
was
charged
with
stealing
a
razor
from
a
colored
person
described
in
the
papers
as
one
morris
cohen
how
long
this
specious
philosophic
discussion
would
have
continued
is
problematical
had
it
not
been
interrupted
by
the
entry
of
a
young
gentleman
dressed
with
a
somewhat
ostentatious
elegance
whose
wizened
face
bore
an
expression
at
once
of
vast
good
nature
and
of
a
deep
and
subtle
wisdom
it
was
clear
that
he
held
an
intimate
relationship
to
tutt
tutt
from
the
familiar
way
in
which
he
returned
their
cordial
if
casual
salutations
well
here
we
are
again
remarked
doon
pleasantly
seating
himself
upon
the
corner
of
tutt
desk
and
spinning
his
bowler
hat
upon
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
the
hospitals
are
empty
the
tombs
is
as
dry
as
a
bone
everybody
good
and
every
day
be
sunday
by
and
by
how
about
that
man
who
stole
a
razor
asked
tutt
discharged
on
the
ground
that
the
fact
that
he
had
a
full
beard
created
a
reasonable
doubt
replied
doon
honestly
there
nothing
doing
in
my
line
unless
you
want
a
tramp
case
a
tramp
case
exclaimed
tutt
tutt
i
suppose
you
call
it
that
he
answered
blandly
i
do
think
he
was
a
burglar
anyhow
he
in
the
tombs
now
shouting
for
a
lawyer
i
listened
to
him
and
made
a
note
of
the
case
tutt
pushed
over
the
box
of
stogies
and
leaned
back
attentively
you
know
the
hepplewhite
house
up
on
fifth
avenue
that
great
stone
one
with
the
driveway
the
tutts
nodded
well
it
appears
that
the
prisoner
our
prospective
client
was
snooping
round
looking
for
something
to
eat
and
found
that
the
butler
had
left
the
front
door
slightly
ajar
filled
with
a
natural
curiosity
to
observe
how
the
other
half
lived
he
thrust
his
way
cautiously
in
and
found
himself
in
the
main
hall
hung
with
tapestry
and
lined
with
stands
of
armor
no
one
was
to
be
seen
ca
you
imagine
him
standing
there
in
his
rags
the
weary
willy
of
the
comic
supplements
gazing
about
him
at
the
the
old
masters
the
onyx
tables
the
statuary
wondering
where
the
pantry
was
and
whether
the
housekeeper
would
be
more
likely
to
feed
him
or
kick
him
out
were
any
of
the
domestics
about
inquired
tutt
not
one
they
were
all
taking
an
afternoon
off
except
the
third
assistant
second
man
who
was
reading
pilgrim
progress
in
the
servants
hall
to
resume
our
friend
was
not
only
very
hungry
but
very
tired
he
had
walked
all
the
way
from
yonkers
and
he
needed
everything
from
a
turkish
bath
to
a
manicuring
he
had
not
been
shaved
for
weeks
his
feet
sank
almost
out
of
sight
in
the
thick
nap
of
the
carpets
it
was
quiet
warm
peaceful
in
there
a
sense
of
relaxation
stole
over
him
he
hated
to
go
away
he
says
and
he
meditated
no
wrong
but
he
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
upstairs
so
up
he
went
it
was
like
the
palace
of
sleeping
beauty
everywhere
his
eyes
were
soothed
by
the
sight
of
hothouse
plants
marble
floors
priceless
rugs
luxurious
divans
stop
cried
tutt
you
are
making
me
sleepy
well
that
what
it
did
to
him
he
wandered
along
the
upper
hall
peeking
into
the
different
rooms
until
finally
he
came
to
a
beautiful
chamber
finished
entirely
in
pink
silk
it
had
a
pink
rug
of
silk
the
furniture
was
upholstered
in
pink
silk
the
walls
were
lined
with
pink
silk
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
great
big
bed
with
a
pink
silk
coverlid
and
a
canopy
of
the
same
it
seemed
to
him
that
that
bed
must
have
been
predestined
for
him
without
a
thought
for
the
morrow
he
jumped
into
it
pulled
the
coverlid
over
his
head
and
went
fast
asleep
meanwhile
at
tea
time
de
lancy
witherspoon
arrived
for
the
bibby
the
butler
followed
by
stocking
the
second
man
bearing
the
hand
luggage
escorted
the
guest
to
the
bouguereau
room
as
the
chamber
is
called
bonnie
doon
carried
away
by
his
own
powers
of
description
waved
his
hand
dramatically
at
the
old
leather
couch
against
the
side
wall
in
which
weary
willy
was
supposed
to
be
reclining
ca
you
see
he
declaimed
the
haughty
bibby
with
nose
in
air
preceding
the
great
dame
of
fashion
enters
the
pink
room
and
comes
to
attention
way
madam
he
declaims
and
witherspoon
sweeps
across
the
threshold
bonnie
doon
picking
up
an
imaginary
skirt
waddled
round
tutt
and
approached
the
couch
suddenly
he
started
back
oh
la
la
he
half
shrieked
dancing
about
there
is
a
man
in
the
bed
both
tutts
stared
hard
at
the
couch
as
if
fully
expecting
to
see
the
form
of
weary
willy
thereon
bonnie
doon
had
a
way
of
making
things
appear
very
vivid
and
sure
enough
he
concluded
there
underneath
the
coverlid
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
was
a
huddled
heap
with
a
stubby
beard
projecting
like
excalibur
from
a
pink
silk
lake
excuse
me
interrupted
tutt
but
may
i
ask
what
this
is
all
about
why
your
new
case
to
be
sure
grinned
bonnie
who
had
he
been
employed
by
any
other
firm
might
have
run
the
risk
of
being
regarded
as
an
ambulance
chaser
to
make
a
long
and
tragic
story
short
they
sent
for
the
watchman
whistled
for
a
policeman
telephoned
for
the
wagon
and
haled
the
sleeper
away
to
prison
where
he
is
now
waiting
to
be
tried
tried
ejaculated
tutt
what
for
for
crime
to
be
sure
answered
doon
what
crime
i
do
know
they
find
one
of
course
tutt
swiftly
lowered
his
legs
from
the
desk
and
brought
his
fist
down
upon
it
with
a
bang
outrageous
what
was
i
just
telling
you
tutt
he
cried
a
flush
coming
into
his
wrinkled
face
this
poor
man
is
a
victim
of
the
overzealousness
which
the
officers
of
the
law
exhibit
in
protecting
the
privileges
and
property
of
the
rich
if
john
de
puyster
hepplewhite
fell
asleep
in
somebody
vestibule
the
policeman
on
post
would
send
him
home
in
a
cab
but
if
a
hungry
tramp
does
the
same
thing
he
runs
him
in
if
john
de
puyster
hepplewhite
should
be
arrested
for
some
crime
they
would
let
him
out
on
bail
while
the
tramp
is
imprisoned
for
weeks
awaiting
trial
though
under
the
law
he
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
is
he
presumed
to
be
innocent
not
much
he
is
presumed
to
be
guilty
otherwise
he
would
not
be
there
but
what
is
he
presumed
to
be
guilty
of
that
what
i
want
to
know
just
because
this
poor
man
hungry
thirsty
and
weary
happened
to
select
a
bed
belonging
to
john
de
puyster
hepplewhite
to
lie
on
he
is
thrown
into
prison
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
and
tried
for
felony
ye
gods
land
of
liberty
well
he
has
been
tried
yet
replied
bonnie
doon
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
why
do
you
defend
him
i
will
shouted
tutt
springing
to
his
feet
i
defend
him
and
acquit
him
he
seized
his
tall
hat
placed
it
upon
his
head
and
strode
rapidly
through
the
door
he
will
too
remarked
bonnie
winking
at
tutt
he
thinks
that
tramp
is
either
a
statesman
or
a
prophet
mused
tutt
his
mind
reverting
to
his
partner
earlier
remarks
he
wo
think
so
after
he
seen
him
replied
doon
it
sometimes
happens
that
those
who
seek
to
establish
great
principles
and
redress
social
evils
involve
others
in
an
involuntary
martyrdom
far
from
their
desires
tutt
would
have
gone
to
the
electric
chair
rather
than
see
the
hepplewhite
tramp
as
he
was
popularly
called
by
the
newspapers
convicted
of
a
crime
but
the
very
fact
that
he
had
become
his
legal
champion
interjected
a
new
element
into
the
situation
particularly
as
tutt
arch
enemy
in
the
district
attorney
office
had
been
placed
in
charge
of
the
case
it
would
have
been
one
thing
to
let
hans
schmidt
that
was
the
name
go
if
after
remaining
in
the
tombs
until
he
had
been
forgotten
by
the
press
he
could
have
been
unobtrusively
hustled
over
the
bridge
of
sighs
to
freedom
then
there
would
have
been
no
comeback
but
with
ephraim
tutt
breathing
fire
and
slaughter
accusing
the
police
and
district
attorney
of
being
trucklers
to
the
rich
and
great
and
oppressors
of
the
poor
law
breakers
in
fact
found
himself
in
the
position
of
one
having
an
elephant
by
the
tail
and
unable
to
let
go
in
fact
it
looked
as
if
the
case
of
the
hepplewhite
tramp
might
become
a
political
issue
that
there
was
something
of
a
comic
side
to
it
made
it
all
the
worse
holy
cats
boys
snorted
district
attorney
peckham
to
the
circle
of
disgruntled
police
officers
and
assistants
gathered
about
him
on
the
occasion
described
by
the
reporters
as
his
making
a
personal
investigation
of
the
case
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
did
you
simply
boot
the
fellow
into
the
street
i
wish
we
had
counselor
assented
the
captain
of
the
hepplewhite
precinct
mournfully
but
we
thought
he
was
a
burglar
i
guess
he
was
at
that
and
it
was
hepplewhite
house
i
heard
that
until
i
sick
of
it
retorted
peckham
one
thing
is
sure
if
we
turn
him
out
now
tutt
will
sue
us
all
for
false
arrest
and
put
the
whole
administration
on
the
bum
snarled
but
i
did
know
the
tramp
would
get
tutt
to
defend
him
expostulated
the
captain
anyhow
ai
it
a
crime
to
go
to
sleep
in
another
man
bed
if
it
ai
it
ought
to
be
declared
his
man
sententiously
ca
you
indict
him
for
burglary
you
can
indict
all
day
the
thing
is
to
convict
snapped
peckham
it
up
to
you
to
square
this
business
so
that
the
law
is
vindicated
somehow
it
must
be
a
crime
to
go
into
a
house
on
fifth
avenue
and
use
it
as
a
hotel
why
you
ca
cross
the
street
faster
than
a
walk
these
days
without
committing
a
crime
everything
a
crime
sure
thing
agreed
the
captain
i
never
yet
had
any
trouble
finding
a
crime
to
charge
a
man
with
once
i
got
the
nippers
on
him
that
so
interjected
the
man
did
you
ever
know
it
was
a
crime
to
mismanage
a
steam
boiler
well
it
is
quite
right
agreed
magnus
the
indictment
clerk
the
great
difficulty
for
the
perfectly
honest
man
nowadays
is
to
avoid
some
act
or
omission
which
the
legislature
has
seen
fit
to
make
a
crime
without
his
knowledge
refilling
a
sarsaparilla
bottle
for
instance
or
getting
up
a
masquerade
ball
or
going
fishing
or
playing
on
sunday
or
loitering
about
a
building
to
overhear
what
people
are
talking
about
inside
that
no
crime
protested
the
captain
scornfully
yes
it
is
too
retorted
magnus
otherwise
known
to
his
fellows
as
caput
because
of
his
supposed
cerebral
inflation
just
like
it
is
a
crime
to
have
any
kind
of
a
show
or
procession
on
sunday
except
a
funeral
in
which
case
it
a
crime
to
make
a
disbursing
noise
at
it
what
a
disbursing
noise
demanded
i
do
know
admitted
magnus
but
that
the
law
anyway
you
make
a
disbursing
noise
at
a
funeral
on
sunday
oh
hell
ejaculated
the
captain
come
to
think
of
it
it
a
crime
to
spit
what
man
is
safe
it
occurs
to
me
continued
magnus
thoughtfully
that
it
is
a
crime
under
the
law
to
build
a
house
on
another
man
land
now
i
should
say
that
there
was
a
close
analogy
between
doing
that
and
sleeping
in
his
bed
hear
hear
commented
caput
magnus
otherwise
known
as
big
head
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
your
fertile
brain
can
easily
devise
a
way
out
of
our
present
difficulty
well
i
no
time
to
waste
on
tramp
cases
remarked
district
attorney
peckham
i
something
more
important
to
attend
to
indict
this
fellow
and
send
him
up
quick
charge
him
with
everything
in
sight
and
trust
in
the
lord
that
the
only
thing
to
be
done
do
bother
me
about
it
that
all
meantime
hepplewhite
became
more
and
more
agitated
entirely
against
his
will
and
so
far
as
he
could
see
without
any
fault
of
his
own
he
suddenly
found
himself
the
center
of
a
violent
and
acrimonious
controversy
respecting
the
fundamental
and
sacred
rights
of
freemen
which
threatened
to
disrupt
society
and
extinguish
the
supremacy
of
the
dominant
local
political
organization
on
the
one
hand
he
was
acclaimed
by
the
conservative
pulpit
and
press
as
a
citizen
who
had
done
exactly
the
right
thing
disinterestedly
enforced
the
law
regardless
of
his
own
convenience
and
safety
as
a
matter
of
principle
and
for
the
sake
of
the
community
a
moral
hero
on
the
other
though
he
was
president
of
several
charitable
organizations
and
at
least
one
orphan
asylum
he
was
execrated
as
a
heartless
brute
an
oppressor
of
the
poor
an
octopus
a
soulless
capitalist
who
fattened
on
the
innocent
and
helpless
and
who
hepplewhite
was
a
bachelor
probably
if
the
truth
could
be
known
lived
a
life
of
horrid
depravity
and
crime
indeed
there
was
a
man
named
tutt
of
whom
hepplewhite
had
never
before
heard
who
publicly
declared
that
he
tutt
would
show
him
hepplewhite
up
for
what
he
was
and
make
him
pay
with
his
body
and
his
blood
to
say
nothing
of
his
money
for
what
he
had
done
and
caused
to
be
done
and
so
hepplewhite
became
even
more
agitated
until
he
dreamed
of
this
tutt
as
an
enormous
bird
like
the
fabled
roc
with
a
malignant
face
and
a
huge
hooked
beak
that
some
day
would
nip
him
in
the
abdomen
and
fly
croaking
away
with
him
witherspoon
had
returned
to
aiken
and
after
the
first
flood
of
commiserations
from
his
friends
on
lists
numbers
one
two
three
and
four
he
felt
neglected
lonely
and
rather
fearful
and
then
one
morning
something
happened
that
upset
his
equanimity
entirely
he
had
just
started
out
for
a
walk
in
the
park
when
a
flashy
person
who
looked
like
an
actor
walked
impudently
up
to
him
and
handed
him
a
piece
of
paper
in
which
was
wrapped
a
silver
half
dollar
in
a
word
hepplewhite
was
subpoenaed
and
the
nervous
excitement
attendant
upon
that
operation
nearly
caused
his
collapse
for
he
was
thereby
commanded
to
appear
before
the
court
of
general
sessions
of
the
peace
upon
the
following
monday
at
ten
as
a
witness
in
a
criminal
action
prosecuted
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
against
hans
schmidt
moreover
the
paper
was
a
color
and
bore
the
awful
name
of
tutt
he
returned
immediately
to
the
house
and
telephoned
for
edgerton
his
lawyer
who
at
once
jumped
into
a
taxi
on
the
corner
of
wall
and
broad
streets
and
hurried
uptown
edgerton
said
hepplewhite
faintly
as
the
lawyer
entered
his
library
this
whole
unfortunate
affair
has
almost
made
me
sick
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
arrest
of
this
man
schmidt
the
police
did
everything
and
now
i
ordered
to
appear
as
a
witness
why
i
hardly
looked
at
the
man
i
should
know
him
if
i
saw
him
do
i
have
to
go
to
court
edgerton
smiled
genially
in
a
manner
which
he
thought
would
encourage
hepplewhite
i
suppose
you
have
to
go
to
court
you
ca
help
that
you
know
if
you
been
subpoenaed
but
you
ca
testify
to
anything
that
i
can
see
it
just
a
formality
formality
groaned
his
client
well
i
supposed
the
arrest
was
just
a
formality
edgerton
smiled
again
rather
unconvincingly
well
you
see
you
ca
always
tell
what
will
happen
when
you
once
start
something
he
began
but
i
did
start
anything
answered
hepplewhite
i
had
nothing
to
say
about
it
at
that
moment
bibby
appeared
in
the
doorway
excuse
me
sir
he
said
there
is
a
young
man
outside
who
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
he
has
a
paper
he
wishes
to
serve
on
you
and
would
you
mind
saving
him
the
trouble
of
waiting
for
you
to
go
out
another
gagged
hepplewhite
yes
sir
thank
you
sir
stammered
bibby
hepplewhite
looked
inquiringly
at
edgerton
and
rose
feebly
he
get
you
sooner
or
later
declared
the
lawyer
a
man
as
well
known
as
you
ca
avoid
process
hepplewhite
bit
his
lips
and
went
out
into
the
hall
presently
he
returned
carrying
a
bunch
of
papers
well
what
is
it
this
time
asked
edgerton
jocosely
it
a
suit
for
false
imprisonment
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
choked
hepplewhite
edgerton
looked
shocked
well
now
you
got
to
convict
him
he
declared
convict
him
retorted
hepplewhite
i
do
want
to
convict
him
i
gladly
give
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
get
out
of
the
the
darn
thing
which
was
as
near
profanity
as
he
had
ever
permitted
himself
to
go
upon
the
following
monday
hepplewhite
proceeded
to
court
flanked
by
his
distinguished
counsel
in
frock
coats
and
tall
hats
simply
because
he
had
been
served
with
a
subpoena
by
tutt
tutt
and
his
distress
was
not
lessened
by
the
crowd
of
reporters
who
joined
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
criminal
courts
building
or
by
the
flashlight
bomb
that
was
exploded
in
the
corridor
in
order
that
the
evening
papers
might
reproduce
his
picture
on
the
front
page
he
had
never
been
so
much
in
the
public
eye
before
and
he
felt
slightly
defiled
for
some
curious
reason
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
and
not
schmidt
was
the
actual
defendant
charged
with
being
guilty
of
something
nor
was
this
impression
dispelled
even
by
listening
to
the
indictment
by
which
the
grand
jury
charged
schmidt
in
eleven
counts
with
burglary
in
the
first
second
and
third
degrees
and
with
the
crime
of
entering
his
hepplewhite
house
under
circumstances
not
amounting
to
a
burglary
but
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony
as
follows
therefore
to
wit
on
the
eleventh
day
of
january
in
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
nineteen
in
the
of
the
said
day
at
the
ward
city
and
county
aforesaid
the
dwelling
house
of
one
john
de
puyster
hepplewhite
there
situate
feloniously
and
burglariously
did
break
into
and
enter
there
being
then
and
there
a
human
being
in
said
dwelling
house
with
intent
to
commit
some
crime
therein
to
wit
the
goods
chattels
and
personal
property
of
the
said
john
de
puyster
hepplewhite
then
and
there
being
found
then
and
there
feloniously
and
burglariously
to
steal
take
and
carry
away
one
silver
tea
service
of
the
value
of
five
hundred
dollars
and
one
pair
of
opera
glasses
of
the
value
of
five
dollars
each
with
force
and
arms
but
that
silver
tea
service
cost
fifteen
thousand
dollars
and
weighs
eight
hundred
pounds
whispered
hepplewhite
order
in
the
court
shouted
captain
phelan
pounding
upon
the
oak
rail
of
the
bar
and
hepplewhite
subsided
yet
as
he
sat
there
between
his
lawyers
listening
to
all
the
extraordinary
things
that
the
grand
jury
evidently
had
believed
schmidt
intended
to
do
the
suspicion
began
gradually
to
steal
over
him
that
something
was
not
entirely
right
somewhere
why
it
was
ridiculous
to
charge
the
man
with
trying
to
carry
off
a
silver
service
weighing
nearly
half
a
ton
when
he
simply
had
gone
to
bed
and
fallen
asleep
still
perhaps
that
was
the
law
however
when
the
assistant
district
attorney
opened
the
people
case
to
the
jury
hepplewhite
began
to
feel
much
more
at
ease
indeed
made
it
very
plain
that
the
defendant
had
been
guilty
of
a
very
grievous
he
pronounced
it
offense
in
forcing
his
way
into
another
man
private
house
it
might
or
might
not
be
burglary
that
would
depend
upon
the
testimony
but
in
any
event
it
was
a
criminal
illegal
entry
and
he
should
ask
for
a
conviction
a
man
house
was
his
castle
and
to
quote
from
that
most
famous
of
orators
and
statesmen
edmund
burke
the
wind
might
enter
the
rain
might
enter
but
the
king
of
england
might
not
enter
thus
schmidt
could
not
enter
the
house
of
hepplewhite
without
making
himself
amenable
to
the
law
hepplewhite
was
filled
with
admiration
for
and
his
drooping
spirits
reared
their
wilted
heads
as
the
prosecutor
called
bibby
to
the
stand
and
elicited
from
him
the
salient
features
of
the
case
the
jury
was
vastly
interested
in
the
butler
personally
as
well
as
his
account
rendered
in
the
choicest
cockney
of
how
he
had
discovered
schmidt
in
his
master
bed
bowed
to
tutt
and
told
him
that
he
might
and
then
it
was
that
hepplewhite
discovered
why
he
had
been
haunted
by
that
mysterious
feeling
of
guilt
for
by
some
occult
and
subtle
method
of
suggestion
on
the
part
of
tutt
the
case
instead
of
being
a
trial
of
schmidt
resolved
itself
into
an
attack
upon
hepplewhite
and
his
retainers
and
upon
the
corrupt
minions
of
the
law
who
had
violated
every
principle
of
justice
decency
and
morality
in
order
to
accomplish
the
unscrupulous
purposes
of
a
merciless
aristocrat
meaning
him
with
biting
sarcasm
tutt
forced
from
the
writhing
bibby
the
admission
that
the
prisoner
was
sound
asleep
in
the
pink
silk
fastnesses
of
the
bouguereau
room
when
he
was
discovered
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
escape
that
he
did
not
assault
anybody
and
that
he
had
appeared
comatose
from
exhaustion
that
there
was
no
sign
of
a
break
anywhere
and
that
the
pair
of
opera
glasses
worth
five
dollars
tutt
invited
the
court
attention
to
this
ingenuous
phraseology
of
caput
magnus
as
a
literary
curiosity
were
a
figment
of
the
imagination
in
a
word
tutt
rolled
bibby
up
and
threw
him
away
while
his
master
shuddered
at
the
open
disclosure
of
his
trusted
vulgarity
mendacity
and
general
lack
of
sportsmanship
somehow
all
at
once
the
case
began
to
break
up
and
go
all
to
pot
the
jury
got
laughing
at
bibby
the
footmen
and
the
cops
as
tutt
painted
for
their
edification
the
scene
following
the
arrival
of
witherspoon
when
schmidt
was
discovered
asleep
as
tutt
put
it
like
goldilocks
in
the
little
small
wee
bear
bed
stocking
was
the
next
witness
and
he
fared
no
better
than
had
bibby
catching
the
judge
eye
made
a
wry
face
and
imperceptibly
lowered
his
left
lid
on
the
side
away
from
the
jury
thus
officially
indicating
that
of
course
the
case
was
a
lemon
but
that
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
except
to
try
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
then
he
rose
and
called
out
unexpectedly
john
de
puyster
hepplewhite
take
the
stand
it
was
entirely
unexpected
no
one
had
suggested
that
he
would
be
called
for
the
prosecution
possibly
was
actuated
by
a
slight
touch
of
malice
possibly
he
wanted
to
be
able
if
the
case
was
lost
to
accuse
hepplewhite
of
losing
it
on
his
own
testimony
but
at
any
rate
he
certainly
had
no
anticipation
of
what
the
ultimate
consequence
of
his
act
would
be
hepplewhite
suddenly
felt
as
though
his
entire
intestinal
mechanism
had
been
removed
but
he
had
no
time
to
take
counsel
of
his
fears
everybody
in
the
courtroom
turned
with
one
accord
and
looked
at
him
he
rose
feeling
as
one
who
dreams
that
he
is
naked
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
he
shrank
back
hesitating
but
hostile
hands
reached
out
and
pushed
him
forward
cringing
he
slunk
to
the
witness
chair
and
for
the
first
time
faced
the
sardonic
eyes
of
the
terrible
tutt
his
adversary
who
looked
scornfully
from
hepplewhite
to
the
jury
and
then
from
the
jury
back
to
hepplewhite
as
if
to
say
look
at
him
call
you
this
a
man
you
are
the
hepplewhite
who
has
been
referred
to
in
the
testimony
as
the
owner
of
the
house
in
which
the
defendant
was
found
inquired
yes
yes
answered
hepplewhite
deprecatingly
the
first
witness
bibby
is
in
your
employ
yes
yes
did
you
have
a
silver
tea
set
of
the
value
of
er
at
least
five
hundred
dollars
in
the
house
it
was
worth
fifteen
thousand
corrected
hepplewhite
oh
now
have
you
been
served
by
the
defendant
attorneys
with
a
summons
and
complaint
in
an
action
for
false
arrest
in
which
damages
are
claimed
in
the
sum
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
object
shouted
tutt
it
is
wholly
irrelevant
i
think
it
shows
the
importance
of
the
result
of
this
trial
to
the
witness
argued
perfunctorily
it
shows
this
case
is
any
joke
even
if
some
people
seem
to
think
it
is
objection
sustained
ruled
the
court
the
question
is
irrelevant
the
jury
is
supposed
to
know
that
every
case
is
important
to
those
concerned
to
the
defendant
as
well
as
to
those
who
charge
him
with
crime
bowed
that
all
you
may
examine
mr
tutt
the
old
lawyer
slowly
unfolded
his
tall
frame
and
gazed
quizzically
down
upon
the
shivering
hepplewhite
you
have
been
sued
by
my
client
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
have
you
he
demanded
object
shot
out
overruled
snapped
the
court
it
is
a
proper
question
for
it
may
show
motive
hepplewhite
sat
helplessly
until
the
shooting
was
over
answer
the
question
suddenly
shouted
tutt
but
i
thought
he
began
do
think
retorted
the
court
sarcastically
the
time
to
think
has
gone
by
answer
i
do
know
what
the
question
is
stammered
hepplewhite
thoroughly
frightened
lord
lord
groaned
in
plain
hearing
of
the
jury
tutt
sighed
sympathetically
in
mock
resignation
my
dear
sir
he
began
in
icy
tones
when
you
had
my
client
arrested
and
charged
with
being
a
burglar
had
you
made
any
personal
inquiry
as
to
the
facts
i
did
have
him
arrested
protested
the
witness
you
deny
that
you
ordered
bibby
to
charge
the
defendant
with
burglary
roared
tutt
take
care
you
know
there
is
such
a
crime
as
perjury
do
you
not
no
i
mean
yes
stuttered
hepplewhite
abjectly
that
is
heard
about
perjury
but
the
police
attended
to
everything
for
me
aha
cried
tutt
snorting
angrily
like
the
war
horse
depicted
in
the
book
of
job
the
police
to
my
client
for
you
did
they
what
do
you
mean
for
you
did
you
pay
them
for
their
little
attention
i
always
send
them
something
on
christmas
said
hepplewhite
just
like
the
postmen
tutt
looked
significantly
at
the
jury
while
a
titter
ran
round
the
court
room
well
he
continued
with
patient
irony
what
we
wish
to
know
is
whether
these
friends
of
yours
whom
you
so
kindly
remember
at
christmas
dragged
the
helpless
man
away
from
your
house
threw
him
into
jail
and
charged
him
with
burglary
by
your
authority
i
did
think
anything
about
it
asserted
hepplewhite
really
i
did
i
assumed
that
they
knew
what
to
do
under
such
circumstances
i
did
suppose
they
needed
any
authority
from
me
tutt
eyed
sideways
the
twelve
jurymen
trying
to
get
out
of
it
are
you
attempting
to
avoid
responsibility
are
you
thinking
of
what
your
position
will
be
if
the
defendant
is
acquitted
with
an
action
against
you
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
ashamed
terrified
humiliated
hepplewhite
almost
burst
into
tears
he
had
suffered
a
complete
moral
disintegration
did
not
know
where
to
turn
for
help
or
sympathy
the
whole
world
seemed
to
have
risen
against
him
he
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
but
the
words
would
not
come
he
looked
appealingly
at
the
judge
but
the
judge
coldly
ignored
him
the
whole
room
seemed
crowded
with
a
multitude
of
leering
eyes
why
had
god
made
him
a
rich
man
why
was
he
compelled
to
suffer
those
terrible
indignities
he
was
not
responsible
for
what
had
been
done
why
then
was
he
being
treated
so
abominably
i
do
want
this
man
punished
he
suddenly
broke
out
in
fervent
expostulation
i
have
nothing
against
him
i
do
believe
he
intended
to
do
any
wrong
and
i
hope
the
jury
will
acquit
him
oho
whistled
tutt
exultantly
while
gazed
at
hepplewhite
in
stupefaction
this
a
man
so
you
admit
that
the
charge
against
my
client
is
without
foundation
insisted
tutt
hepplewhite
nodded
weakly
i
do
know
rightly
what
the
charge
is
but
i
do
think
he
meant
any
harm
he
faltered
then
why
did
you
have
the
police
put
him
under
arrest
and
hale
him
away
challenged
tutt
ferociously
i
supposed
they
had
to
if
he
came
into
my
house
said
hepplewhite
then
he
added
shamefacedly
i
know
it
sounds
silly
but
frankly
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
anything
to
say
in
the
matter
if
your
client
has
been
injured
by
my
fault
or
mistake
i
will
gladly
reimburse
him
as
handsomely
as
you
wish
gasped
then
he
made
a
funnel
of
his
hands
and
whispered
toward
the
bench
take
it
away
for
heaven
sake
that
is
all
remarked
tutt
with
deep
sarcasm
making
an
elaborate
bow
in
the
direction
of
hepplewhite
thank
you
for
your
excellent
intentions
a
snicker
followed
hepplewhite
as
he
dragged
himself
back
to
his
seat
among
the
spectators
he
felt
as
though
he
had
passed
through
a
clothes
wringer
dimly
he
heard
tutt
addressing
the
court
and
i
move
your
honor
the
lawyer
was
paying
that
you
take
the
counts
for
burglary
in
the
first
second
and
third
degrees
away
from
the
jury
on
the
ground
that
there
has
been
a
complete
failure
of
proof
that
my
client
broke
into
the
house
of
this
man
hepplewhite
either
by
night
or
by
day
or
that
he
assaulted
anybody
or
stole
anything
there
or
ever
intended
to
motion
granted
agreed
the
judge
i
quite
agree
with
you
tutt
there
is
no
evidence
here
of
any
breaking
in
fact
the
inferences
are
all
the
other
way
i
further
move
that
you
take
from
the
consideration
of
the
jury
the
remaining
count
of
illegally
entering
the
house
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime
and
direct
the
jury
to
acquit
the
defendant
for
lack
of
evidence
continued
tutt
but
what
was
your
client
doing
in
the
house
inquired
the
judge
he
had
no
particular
business
in
it
had
he
that
does
not
make
his
presence
a
crime
your
honor
retorted
the
lawyer
a
man
is
not
guilty
of
a
felony
who
falls
asleep
on
my
haycock
why
should
he
be
if
he
falls
asleep
in
my
bed
the
judge
smiled
we
have
no
illegal
entry
statute
with
respect
to
fields
or
meadows
tutt
he
remarked
no
i
shall
be
obliged
to
let
the
jury
decide
whether
this
defendant
went
into
that
house
for
an
honest
or
dishonest
purpose
it
is
clearly
a
proper
question
for
them
to
pass
upon
proceed
with
your
case
now
when
as
in
the
case
of
the
hepplewhite
tramp
the
chief
witness
for
the
prosecution
throws
up
his
hands
and
offers
to
repay
the
defendant
for
the
wrong
he
has
done
him
naturally
it
is
all
over
but
the
shouting
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
call
the
defendant
tutt
told
the
court
in
view
of
the
admissions
made
by
the
last
witness
i
am
ready
to
proceed
with
the
summing
up
as
you
deem
wise
answered
the
judge
proceed
then
through
a
blur
of
sight
and
sound
hepplewhite
dimly
heard
tutt
addressing
the
jury
and
saw
them
lean
forward
to
catch
his
every
word
beside
him
edgerton
was
saying
protestingly
may
i
ask
why
you
made
those
fool
statements
on
the
witness
stand
because
i
did
want
an
innocent
man
convicted
returned
hepplewhite
tartly
well
you
get
your
wish
sniffed
his
lawyer
and
you
get
soaked
for
about
twenty
thousand
dollars
for
false
arrest
i
do
care
retorted
the
client
and
what
more
i
hope
tutt
gets
a
substantial
fee
out
of
it
he
strikes
me
as
a
lawyer
who
knows
his
business
the
oldest
and
fattest
court
officers
men
so
old
and
fat
that
they
remembered
the
trial
of
boss
tweed
and
the
days
when
delancey
nicoll
was
the
white
hope
of
the
brownstone
court
house
declared
summation
was
the
greatest
that
ever
they
heard
for
the
shrewd
old
lawyer
had
an
artist
hand
with
which
he
played
upon
the
keyboard
of
the
jury
and
knew
just
when
to
pull
out
the
stops
of
the
of
pathos
and
the
grand
diapason
of
indignation
and
defiance
so
he
began
by
tickling
their
sense
of
humor
with
an
ironic
description
of
afternoon
tea
at
hepplewhite
with
bibby
and
stocking
as
chief
actors
until
all
twelve
shook
with
suppressed
laughter
and
the
judge
was
forced
to
hide
his
face
behind
the
ridiculed
the
idea
of
a
criminal
who
wanted
to
commit
a
crime
calmly
going
to
sleep
in
a
pink
silk
bed
in
broad
daylight
and
then
brought
tears
to
their
eyes
as
he
pictured
the
wretched
homeless
tramp
sick
footsore
and
starving
who
drawn
by
the
need
of
food
and
warmth
to
this
silk
nest
of
luxury
was
clubbed
arrested
and
jailed
simply
because
he
had
violated
the
supposed
sanctity
of
a
rich
man
home
the
jury
watched
him
as
intently
as
a
dog
watches
a
piece
of
meat
held
over
its
nose
they
smiled
with
him
they
wept
with
him
they
glared
at
hepplewhite
and
they
gazed
in
a
friendly
way
at
schmidt
whom
tutt
had
bailed
out
just
before
the
trial
the
very
stars
in
their
courses
seemed
warring
for
tutt
tutt
in
the
words
of
phelan
there
was
nothing
to
it
thank
god
concluded
tutt
eloquently
that
in
this
land
of
liberty
in
which
we
are
privileged
to
dwell
no
man
can
be
convicted
of
a
crime
except
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
a
right
sacred
under
our
constitution
and
inherited
from
magna
charta
that
foundation
stone
of
english
liberty
in
which
the
barons
forced
king
john
to
declare
that
freeman
shall
be
taken
or
imprisoned
or
disseized
or
outlawed
or
exiled
or
in
any
way
harmed
save
by
the
lawful
judgment
of
his
peers
or
by
the
law
of
the
land
had
i
the
time
i
would
demonstrate
to
you
the
arbitrary
character
of
our
laws
and
the
inequality
with
which
they
are
administered
but
in
this
case
the
chief
witness
has
already
admitted
the
innocence
of
the
defendant
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
the
prosecution
has
cried
i
leave
my
client
in
your
hands
he
resumed
his
seat
contentedly
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
silk
handkerchief
the
judge
looked
down
at
with
raised
eyebrows
i
will
leave
the
case
to
the
jury
on
your
honor
charge
remarked
the
latter
carelessly
gentlemen
of
the
jury
began
the
judge
the
defendant
is
accused
of
entering
the
house
of
hepplewhite
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime
therein
hepplewhite
sat
his
head
upon
his
breast
for
what
seemed
to
him
several
hours
he
had
but
one
thought
to
escape
his
ordeal
had
been
far
worse
than
he
had
anticipated
but
he
had
made
a
discovery
he
had
suddenly
realized
that
one
can
not
avoid
one
duties
to
one
fellows
by
leaving
one
affairs
to
others
not
even
to
the
police
he
perceived
that
he
had
lived
with
his
head
stuck
in
the
sand
he
had
tried
to
escape
from
his
responsibilities
as
a
citizen
by
hiding
behind
the
thick
walls
of
his
stone
mansion
on
fifth
avenue
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
do
differently
if
he
ever
had
the
chance
meanwhile
was
not
the
jury
ever
going
to
set
the
poor
man
free
they
had
indeed
remained
out
a
surprisingly
long
time
in
order
merely
to
reach
a
verdict
which
was
a
mere
formality
ah
there
they
were
hepplewhite
watched
with
palpitating
heart
while
they
straggled
slowly
in
the
clerk
made
the
ordinary
perfunctory
inquiry
as
to
what
their
verdict
was
hepplewhite
did
not
hear
what
the
foreman
said
in
reply
but
he
saw
both
the
tutts
and
start
from
their
seats
and
heard
a
loud
murmur
rise
throughout
the
court
room
what
that
cried
the
clerk
in
astonished
tones
what
did
you
say
mister
foreman
i
said
that
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
replied
the
foreman
calmly
tutt
stared
incredulously
at
the
twelve
traitors
who
had
betrayed
him
never
mind
tutt
whispered
number
six
confidentially
you
did
the
best
you
could
your
argument
was
fine
grand
but
nobody
could
ever
make
us
believe
that
your
client
went
into
that
house
for
any
purpose
except
to
steal
whatever
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
besides
it
hepplewhite
fault
he
means
well
and
anyhow
a
nut
like
that
has
got
to
be
protected
against
himself
he
might
have
enlightened
tutt
further
upon
the
psychology
of
the
situation
had
not
the
judge
at
that
moment
ordered
the
prisoner
arraigned
at
the
bar
have
you
ever
been
convicted
before
asked
his
honor
sharply
sure
replied
the
hepplewhite
tramp
carelessly
i
done
three
or
four
bits
i
a
burglar
but
you
ca
give
me
more
than
a
year
for
illegal
entry
that
is
quite
true
admitted
his
honor
stiffly
and
it
is
half
enough
he
hesitated
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
you
tell
us
what
you
were
doing
in
hepplewhite
bed
oh
i
do
mind
returned
the
defendant
with
the
superior
air
of
one
who
has
put
something
over
when
i
heard
the
guy
in
the
knee
breeches
coming
up

just

answered
bonnie
that
what
he
said
he
says
now
he
a

retorted
tutt
wrathfully
i

he
knows
what
he
is
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
an
outrageous
verdict
with
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
to
support
it
bonnie
lit
a
cigarette
doubtfully
oh
i
do

he
muttered
the

to
have

said
to

why
do
you
go
round
and
see
what
has
become
of
of
horse

i
will
assented
miss

it
makes
me
feel
rich
just
to
talk
about
such
things
i
just
love
it
many
a

has
taken
advantage
of
just
that
kind
of

upon

gathered

tobias
greenbaum
of

greenbaum
beck
carefully
placed
his
cigar
where
it
would
not
char
his
italian
renaissance
desk
and
smoothed
out
the
list
which
elderberry
the
secretary
of
the
horse
neck
extension
copper
mining
company
handed
to
him
the
list
was
typed
on
thin
sheets
of
foolscap
and
contained
the
names
of
stockholders
but
as
it
had
lain
rolled
up
in
the
bottom
of
elderberry
desk
for
five
years
without
being
disturbed
it
was
inclined
to
resist
the
gentle
pressure
of
greenbaum
fingers
greenbaum
glanced
sharply
round
the
lake
that
separated
him
from
the
other
directors
of
horse
neck
rather
as
if
he
had
detected
his
associates
in
a
crime
isaacs
says
he
announced
in
an
arrogant
almost
insulting
tone
though
below
the
surface
he
was
an
entirely
genial
person
that
the
new
vein
in
the
amphalula
runs
into
the
west
drift
of
horse
neck
almost
to
where
we
quit
work
in
number
nine
five
years
ago
if
it
does
it
will
make
it
a
bonanza
property
emphatically
declared
his
partner
scherer
a
dolichocephalous
person
with
very
black
hair
and
thin
bluish
cheeks
it
a
pity
we
did
buy
it
all
in
at
ten
cents
a
share
we
did
retorted
greenbaum
all
that
could
be
shaken
out
we
got
all
the
stock
that
has
gravitated
to
the
cemeteries
even
if
the
amphalula
vein
does
run
into
it
it
will
come
near
enough
to
make
horse
neck
worth
dollars
per
share
it
a
proposition
commented
hunn
dryly
who
controls
amphalula
we
do
snapped
greenbaum
then
it
a
cinch
returned
hunn
mildly
shake
out
the
sleepers
reorganize
and
sell
or
hold
as
seems
most
advisable
later
on
elderberry
cleared
his
throat
tentatively
if
you
gentlemen
will
pardon
me
i
have
been
considering
this
matter
for
some
little
time
he
hazarded
elderberry
was
not
only
the
professional
salaried
secretary
of
horse
neck
but
was
also
treasurer
of
the
amphalula
and
general
factotum
representative
and
interlocking
director
for
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
in
their
various
mining
enterprises
combining
in
his
person
almost
as
many
offices
as
in
the
mikado
though
he
could
not
have
claimed
to
serve
as
first
lord
of
the
treasury
lord
chief

lord
high
admiral
master
of
the
buck
hounds
groom
of
the
back
stairs
archbishop
of
titipu
and
lord
mayor
both
acting
and
elect
all
rolled
into
one
he
could
with
entire
modesty
have
admitted
the
soft
impeachment
of
being
simultaneously
treasurer
of
amphalula
of
hooligan

and
red

all
these
various
properties
were
either
owned
or
controlled
by
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
and
had
been
acquired
with
the
use
of
the
same
original
capital
in
various
entirely
legal
ways
which
at
the
present
moment
are
irrelevant
the
firm
was
a
strictly
honorable
business
house
from
both
their
own
point
of
view
and
that
of
the
street
everything
they
did
was
with
and
by
the
advice
of
counsel
yet
not
one
of
these
gentlemen
including
greenbaum
the
dolichocephalous
scherer
and
the
acephalous
hunn
had
ever
done
a
stroke
of
productive
work
or
contributed
anything
toward
the
common
weal
in
fact
distress
to
somebody
in
some
form
and
usually
to
a
large
number
of
persons
inevitably
followed
whatever
deal
they
undertook
since
their
business
was
speculating
in
mining
properties
and
unloading
the
bad
ones
upon
an
unsuspecting
public
which
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
had
permitted
to
deceive
itself
thus
when
greenbaum
called
upon
elderberry
for
advice
it
savored
strongly
of
koko
consulting
and
was
sometimes
almost
as
confusing
for
just
as
on
these
occasions
was
wo
to
reply
certainly
in
which
of
my
capacities
as
first
lord
of
the
treasury
lord
chamberlain
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
privy
purse
or
private
secretary
so
the
financial
and
corporate
elderberry
might
equally
well
ask
exactly
but
are
you
seeking
my
advice
as
secretary
of
horse
neck
of
holy
jo
of
cowhide
number
five
or
as
of
hooligan
gulch
and
red
water
treasurer
of
amphalula
or
president
of
blimp
consolidated
just
now
it
was
of
course
obvious
that
he
was
addressing
the
company
in
his
capacity
of
secretary
of
horse
neck
it
goes
without
saying
gentlemen
that
this
property
is
pretty
nearly
down
and
out
you
will
recall
that
most
of
the
insiders
sold
out
on
the
tail
of

again
the
mines
are
full
of
water
work
was
abandoned
over
four
years
ago
and
the
property
is
practically
defunct
the
original
capitalization
was
ten

at

a

we
own

control
at

four
million

for

we
paid

we
had
sold
our
original
holdings
for
one

sixty
to
one
dollar
a

while
horse
neck
represents
a
handsome
profit
in
my
opinion
he
cleared
his
throat
again
as
if
deprecating
the
vulgarity
of
his
phrase
it
is
good
for
another
whirl
you
say
it
full
of
water
inquired
hunn
it
will
cost
about
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
pump
out
the
mines
and
a
hundred
thousand
to
repair
the
machinery
then
there
quite
an
indebtedness
about
thousand
and
tax
liens
another
fifty
half
a
million
dollars
would
put
horse
neck
on
the
map
and
if
the
amphalula
vein
crosses
the
property
it
will
be
worth
ten
millions
if
it
does
the
chance
that
it
is
going
to
will
make
a
market
for
the
stock
elderberry
swept
with
a
bland
inquiring
eye
the
shore
of
the
glassy
sea
about
which
his
associates
were
gathered
i
been
over
the
ground
announced
greenbaum
and
it
a
good
gamble
we
want
horse
neck
for
ourselves
at
any
rate
until
we
are
confident
that
it
a
real
lemon
half
a
million
will
do
it
personally
put
up
a
hundred
thousand
how
are
you
going
to
get
rid
of
the
fifty
thousand
other
stockholders
asked
beck
dubiously
we
do
want
them
trailing
along
with
us
i
propose
answered
elderberry
brightly
in
his
capacity
as
chief
conspirator
for
scherer
hunn
that
we
organize
a
new
corporation
to
be
called
limited
and
capitalize
it
at
a
million
dollars
one
million
shares
at
a
dollar
a
share
then
we
will
execute
a
contract
between
horse
neck
and
lallapaloosa
by
the
terms
of
which
the
old
bankrupt
corporation
will
sell
to
the
new
corporation
all
its
assets
for
one
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
we
underwrite
the
stock
of
lallapaloosa
at
fifty
cents
a
share
thus
supplying
the
new
corporation
with
the
funds
with
which
to
purchase
the
properties
of
the
old
in
a
word
we
shall
get
horse
neck
for
a
hundred
and
thousand
and
have
three
hundred
and
thousand
left
out
of
what
we
subscribe
to
underwrite
the
stock
to
put
it
on
its
feet
that
all
right
debated
hunn
but
how
about
the
other
stockholders
in
horse
neck
that
beck
referred
to
where
do
they
come
in
i
thought
of
that
returned
elderberry
of
course
you
ca
just
squeeze
out
entirely
that
would
be
legal
they
must
be
given
the
chance
to
subscribe
at
par
to
the
stock
of
the
new
corporation
on
the
basis
of
one
share
in
the
new
for
every
ten
they
hold
in
the
old
or
as
horse
neck
is
a
delaware
corporation
to
have
their
old
stock
appraised
under
the
laws
of
delaware
in
point
of
fact
they
all
written
off
their
holdings
in
horse
neck
as
a
total
loss
years
ago
and
you
could
drag
into
putting
in
any
new
money
they
simply
let
it
go
forfeit
their
stock
in
horse
neck
and
be
wiped
out
because
they
were
not
willing
to
go
in
and
reorganize
the
property
with
us
they
would
if
they
knew
about
amphalula
remarked
beck
well
they
do
snapped
greenbaum
and
we
under
no
obligations
to
tell
they
can
infer
what
they
like
from
the
fact
that
neck
has
been
selling
for
ten
cents
a
share
for
the
last
three
years
is
that
right
chippingham
inquired
beck
of
the
attorney
who
was
in
attendance
i
mean
is
it
legal
perfectly
legal
replied
chippingham
conclusively
a
corporation
has
a
perfect
right
to
dispose
of
its
entire
assets
for
a
proper
consideration
and
if
any
minority
stockholder
feels
aggrieved
he
can
take
the
matter
to
the
delaware
courts
and
get
his
equity
assessed
besides
everybody
is
treated
alike
all
the
stockholders
in
neck
can
subscribe
pro
rata
for
lallapaloosa
only
they
wo
grinned
scherer
and
so
as
they
are
wiped
out
the
new
corporation
that
is
us
in
fact
gets
their
equity
just
as
much
as
if
they
had
deeded
it
to
us
that
is
we
get
for
nothing
about
the
value
of
the
property
agreed
elderberry
now
i
been
over
the
list
and
i
do
think
you
hear
a
peep
from
any
of
them
he
got
on
the
list
he
got
on
the
list
and
they
none
of
be
missed
they
none
of
be
missed
hummed
beck
it
looks
good
to
me
i
take
a
hundred
thousand
chippingham
has
the
papers
drawn
already
continued
elderberry
of
course
you
got
to
give
the
old
stockholders
notice
but
we
can
rush
the
thing
through
and
before
anybody
wakes
up
the
thing
will
be
done
then
they
can
holler
all
they
want
well
i
come
in
announced
hunn
complacently
so
will
i
echoed
scherer
and
the
firm
can
underwrite
the
last
hundred
thousand
and
that
will
clean
it
up
is
it
all
right
for
us
to
underwrite
the
stock
ourselves
at
half
price
inquired
beck
i
mean
is
it
legal
sure
reiterated
chippingham
somebody
got
to
underwrite
it
why
not
us
move
we
adjourn
said
greenbaum
elderberry
the
usual
elderberry
removed
from
his
change
pocket
five
glittering
gold
pieces
and
slid
one
across
the
glass
sheet
to
each
director
second
motion
carried
all
up
seventh
inning
smiled
scherer
and
the
directors
pocketing
their
gold
pieces
arose
if
as
it
has
been
defined
ethics
consists
of
a
system
of
principles
and
rules
concerning
moral
obligations
and
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
it
may
be
interesting
to
speculate
as
to
whether
or
not
these
gentlemen
had
any
or
not
and
if
so
what
it
may
have
been
but
in
considering
this
somewhat
nice
question
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
were
bankers
of
standing
and
were
advised
by
a
firm
of
attorneys
of
the
highest
reputation
on
its
face
and
as
it
was
about
to
be
represented
to
the
stockholders
of
horse
neck
the
proposition
appeared
fair
enough
the
circular
shortly
after
sent
out
to
all
the
names
upon
the
list
stated
succinctly
that
financial
and
labor
conditions
had
been
such
that
it
had
been
found
impossible
to
operate
the
mine
profitably
for
several
years
that
it
had
depreciated
greatly
in
value
owing
to
the
water
which
had
accumulated
in
its
lower
levels
that
it
had
exhausted
its
surplus
that
a
heavy
indebtedness
had
accumulated
that
the
outstanding
notes
had
been
protested
and
that
the
property
would
be
sold
under
foreclosure
unless
money
was
immediately
raised
to
pay
them
the
interest
due
and
taxes
that
half
a
million
dollars
was
needed
to
put
the
property
in
operation
and
that
there
was
no
way
to
secure
it
as
nobody
was
willing
to
loan
money
to
a
bankrupt
mining
concern
that
under
these
circumstances
no
practical
method
had
been
proposed
except
to
organize
a
new
corporation
capitalized
at
one
million
instead
of
ten
to
the
stock
of
which
each
shareholder
in
horse
neck
might
subscribe
in
proportion
to
his
holdings
at
par
and
to
which
the
assets
of
the
old
corporation
should
be
transferred
practically
for
its
debts
that
this
in
a
word
was
the
only
way
to
save
the
situation
and
possibly
make
a
go
of
a
bad
business
and
that
it
was
a
gamble
in
which
the
old
stockholders
had
a
right
up
to
a
certain
date
to
participate
if
they
saw
fit
those
that
did
not
would
find
their
stock
in
horse
neck
entirely
valueless
as
it
would
have
no
assets
left
which
had
not
been
transferred
to
lallapaloosa
stockholders
who
were
dissatisfied
could
protest
against
the
enabling
resolution
to
be
offered
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
stockholders
of
horse
neck
to
be
held
the
following
week
at
wilmington
delaware
and
could
avail
themselves
of
the
right
to
have
their
equity
assessed
under
the
laws
of
delaware
but
as
the
liabilities
practically
equaled
the
present
value
of
the
property
that
equity
would
naturally
be
highly
problematical
now
as
a
matter
of
morals
or
of
law
the
only
thing
that
made
the
proposed
reorganization
unethical
or
inequitable
was
the
single
trifling
fact
that
those
responsible
for
it
were
the
only
ones
who
knew
of
the
existence
and
proximity
of
the
amphalula
vein
when
a
mining
company
a
railroad
an
oil
well
or
any
other
enterprise
is
down
and
out
it
is
only
fair
that
the
majority
stockholders
who
are
obliged
to
protect
their
investment
should
have
the
right
to
call
upon
the
rest
to
come
forward
and
do
their
share
or
else
drop
out
a
minority
stockholder
can
not
appeal
to
any
canon
of
fair
play
whereby
he
should
be
entitled
to
sit
back
and
let
the
majority
take
all
the
risks
and
then
claim
his
share
of
the
profits
the
imponderable
element
of
injustice
in
the
situation
consisted
in
the
suppression
of
a
fact
which
the
directors
concealed
but
concerning
which
however
they
made
no
representation
false
or
otherwise
they
were
going
to
risk
half
a
million
dollars
of
their
own
money
and
they
wanted
the
whole
gamble
for
themselves
they
sincerely
felt
that
nobody
else
was
entitled
to
take
that
risk
with
them
once
they
had
floated
horse
neck
they
had
come
to
look
upon
it
as
their
own
private
affair
the
minority
had
no
rights
which
they
the
majority
were
bound
to
respect
the
minority
were
nothing
but
a
lot
of
piking
gamblers
anyway
who
bought
or
sold
for
a
rise
or
fall
of
a
few
cents
they
knew
nothing
of
the
property
and
cared
less
for
its
real
value
they
were
merely
traders
and
if
they
lost
they
forgot
it
or
tried
to
on
the
other
hand
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
were
promoters
who
contributed
something
to
the
economic
advancement
of
the
nation
regarding
my
hat
which
you
suggested
this
morning
should
be
pressed
at
a
cost
of
fifty
cents
remarked
tutt
to
miss
wiggin
when
he
returned
to
the
office
upon
the
adjournment
of
court
in
the
afternoon
and
replaced
that
ancient
object
in
its
accustomed
regarding
that
precious
hat
of
mine
he
eyed
it
affectionately
i
can
only
say
that
i
would
as
soon
send
myself
to
a
establishment
as
to
permit
its
profanation
by
the
iron
of
a
haberdasher
miss
wiggin
laughed
lightly
that
does
explain
your
cryptic
statement
that
it
would
probably
cost
you
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
she
replied
still
tutt
turned
suddenly
upon
his
heel
and
held
her
with
an
upraised
hand
the
bony
wrist
of
which
was
encircled
after
an
intervening
space
of
some
five
inches
by
a
frayed
cuff
confined
with
a
black
onyx
button
the
size
of

he
cried
in
the
deep
resonant
voice
that
he
used
in
addressing
juries
at
the
climax
of
a
peroration

integuments
of
my

ancient
habiliments
of

making
him
a

without

i
should

in

i
am
a

of

just
as
you
my
dear

are
one
of

devoted

can
you

going

no

these

he
who
steals

may
steal

i

so
estimate
my

and
you
can
assay
the
value
of
my
hat
what
am
i
worth
in
your
opinion
and
then
miss
wiggin
having
glanced
cautiously
if
quickly
round
made
a
most
astonishing
declaration
just
about
a
million
times
more
than
anybody
else
in
the
whole
world
you
old
dear
she
whispered
and
rising
upon
her
toes
she
kissed
his
wrinkled
cheek
dear
me
you
really
must
do
that
gasped
tutt
well
she
retorted
you
can
discharge
me
if
you
like
but
first
sit
down
light
a
cigar
and
let
me
tell
you
something
tutt
did
as
he
was
bid
chuckling
well
said
miss
wiggin
there
is
such
a
thing
as
horse
neck
extension
after
all
um
you
do
say
he
answered
struggling
to
make
his
stogy
draw
and
it
has
an
office
with
about
a
hundred
other
corporations
of
various
kinds
most
of
them
with
names
that
sound
like
the
zoo
yellow
wildcat
jumping
leapfrog
and
that
sort
of
thing
it
seems
horse
neck
is
played
out
and
they
are
going
to
reorganize
it
who
are
demanded
her
employer
suddenly
sitting
erect
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
the
dickens
they
are
he
ejaculated
that
bunch
of
pirates
not
if
i
know
it
why
not
reorganize
reorganize
reorganization
is
my
middle

cried
tutt
so
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
are
going
to
reorganize
something
are
they
let
try
not
so
long
as
i
got
my
hat
this
is
all
very
enigmatical
to
me
replied
miss
wiggin
but
then
i
only
a
woman
are
they
all
right
why
should
they
reorganize
a
mine
if
it
exhausted
if
it
exhausted
why
do
they
want
to
reorganize
it
he
demanded
climbing
to
his
feet
let
me
tell
you
something
minerva
all
my
life
i
been
fighting
against
tyranny
the
tyranny
of
the
law
the
tyranny
of
power
the
tyranny
of
money
he
drew
fiercely
on
his
stogy
which
being
desiccated
flared
like
a
roman
candle
you
do
need
to
tell
me
what
this
plan
of
reorganization
is
because
they
would
propose
one
unless
it
was
going
to
benefit
them
in
some
way
and
the
only
way
it
can
be
made
to
benefit
them
is
at
the
expense
of
the
other
stockholders
erat
tutt
seemed
to
have
become
distended
somehow
and
to
have
spread
over
the
entire
wall
surface
of
his
office
like
the
genie
which
the
fisherman
innocently
permitted
to
escape
from
the
bottle
there
is
one
reorganization
scheme
in
a
hundred
that
is
crooked
somewhere
according
to
that
if
a
business
is
unsuccessful
it
ought
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
pot
for
fear
that
somebody
might
make
a
profit
in
putting
it
on
its
feet
she
countered
i
think
you
a
violent
irascible
prejudiced
old
man
all
the
same
he
retorted
show
me
a
reorganization
scheme
and
show
you
a
flimflam
what
this
one
bet
you
anything
you
like
it
as
crooked
as
a
ram
horn
i
do
have
to
hear
about
it
do
want
to
read
the
plan
but
i
bust
it
higher
than
hades
see
if
i
do
he
spat
the
remaining
filaments
of
his
stogy
from
the
window
and
fished
out
another
how
do
we

well
you
send
for
him
to
come
down
here
and
sign
the

what
papers

and

but
there
is
any
there
will
be
all
right
by
the
time
he
gets
here
miss

looked
first
puzzled
and
then
pained
i
do
understand
she
said
rather
stiffly
do
you
mean
that
the
firm
of
tutt
tutt
is
going
to
engage
in
the
enterprise
of
trying
to
break
up
a
plan
of

it
is

he
cried
hotly
you

scherer

are
proposing
to
reorganize
a

company
you
admit
we
hold
some
of
the
stock
well
as
the
and
perennial

of
the
outraged

i
going
to
attack

and
bust

cluck

a
dingy
bottle
wrapped
in
a
coat
of
many
colors
and
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
malt
extract
when
greenbaum
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
and
informed
by
elderberry
in
disgruntled
tones
that
somebody
had
just
served
upon
him
an
order
to
show
cause
why
the
proposed
reorganization
of
horse

should
not
be
set
aside
and
enjoined
he
not
only
became
instantly
annoyed
but
highly
excited

he
almost
screamed

greenbaum
interrupting
i
do

retorted
elderberry
or
barrows
either
well
skip
all
the
legal
rot
and
get
to
the
point
directed
greenbaum
ordered
that
the

show
cause
at
a

the
defendant
from
disposing
of

for
the
appointment

and
why
the
complainant
should
not
have
such
other
further
and
different
relief
as
may
be
equitable
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
elderberry
was
under
a
convincing
delusion
that
he
could
actually
hear
the
thoughts
that
were
rattling
round
in
greenbaum
brain
you
there
he
inquired
presently
oh
yes
i
here
retorted
greenbaum
this
is
the
devil
of
a
note
have
you
spoken
to
chippingham
yes
what
does
he
say
he
says
it
awkward
they
have
got
hold
somewhere
of
one
of
our
old
circulars
of
in
which
the
property
is
described
as
worth
about
ten
million
dollars
that
was
during
the
boom
you
remember
and
they
claim
we
are
selling
it
to
ourselves
for
less
than
one
million
and
that
on
its
face
it
a
fraud
on
the
minority
stockholders
who
ca
afford
to
buy
stock
in
the
new
corporation
as
of
course
it
would
be
if
the
mine
was
really
worth
ten
million
or
anything
like
it
did
we
really
ever
get
out
any
circular
like
that
demanded
greenbaum
in
a
protesting
voice
i
do
recall
any
that
was
when
we
were
making
a
market
for
the
stock
elderberry
reminded
him
we
could
say
enough
honestly
to
look
at
the
thing
now
is
enough
to
make
you
sick
well
it
just
a
that
what
it
is
some
crook
like
this
tutt
or
this
barrows
has
found
out
about
amphalula
and
is
bringing
a
strike
suit
you
have
to
call
a
meeting
right
away
i
like
to
strangle
all
these
shyster
lawyers
and
it
never
occurred
to
greenbaum
that
the
possible
existence
of
the
amphalula
vein
was
what
in
fact
made
the
order
to
show
cause
justifiable
his
actual
ground
of
complaint
being
that
anybody
should
as
he
assumed
have
found
out
about
it
in
defiance
of
his
plans

my

a
bona

may
i
be
pardoned
for
interrupting

chippingham
springing
to
his
feet
i
think
the
court
should
be
informed
at
the
outset
that
this
man

is
a
notorious
judge
pollak
raised
his
eyebrows
this
is
an
outrage
thundered
tutt
his

my

like
all

has
had
his
misfortunes
but
they
are
happily
a

he
has
the

as
if

for
the

in
his

smartly
arrayed
in
a
new
checked
suit
red
tie
shoes
and
suède
gloves
and
with
his
beard
neatly
trimmed
this
is
the
unfortunate
man
whose
honest
savings
of
a
lifetime
are
being
wrested
from
him
by
an
unscrupulous
group
of
manipulators
who
in
my
opinion
are
more
deserving
of
confinement
behind
prison
walls
than
he
ever
was
the
gentlemen
with
the
tall
hats
bit
their
lips
and
showed
signs
of
poorly
suppressed
agitation
but
your

an
mr

repeated
the

quietly
yes
your

he
is
when
and
how
did
he
become
possessed
of
his

tutt
turned
to
doc
with
an

ineffectually
striving
to
master
his
righteous
indignation
tell
the
court
barrows
he
cried
in
your
own
words
doc
barrows
wonderingly
rose
if
you
please
sir
he
began
it
quite
a
long
story
you
see
i
was
the
owner
of
all
the
stock
of
the
chicago
water
front
and
terminal
company
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
title
deed
which
i
can
explain
to
you
privately
if
you
wish
and
when
i
was
er
visiting
up
on
the
hudson
i
met
a
man
there
who
was
the
owner
of
a
hundred
thousand
shares
of
horse
neck
and
we
agreed
to
exchange
the
judge
tried
to
hide
a
slight
smile
i
see
he
replied
pleasantly
and
what
was
the
man
name
oscar
bloom
sir
the
gentlemen
with
the
tall
hats
exchanged
agitated
glances
do
you
know
how
he
got
his
stock
no
sir
that
is
all
go
on
mr
tutt
doc
sat
down
while
tutt
again
unhooked
his
lank
form
to
resume
where
i
was
interrupted
your
honor
the
directors
controlling
a
majority
of
the
stock
of
this
corporation
the
capital
of
which
is
ten
millions
of
dollars
have
made
a
contract
to
sell
all
of
its
properties
to
another
corporation
organized
by
themselves
and
capitalized
for
one
million
for
the
sum
of
one
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
it
is
true
that
in
their
plan
of
reorganization
they
offer
to
permit
any
stockholder
in
the
old
corporation
to
subscribe
for
stock
in
the
new
at
par
thus
at
first
glance
placing
all
upon
what
seems
to
be
an
equality
but
any
stockholder
who
does
not
see
fit
to
subscribe
or
can
not
afford
to
do
so
is
wiped
out
for
there
will
be
nothing
left
in
the
way
of
assets
in
horse
neck
after
the
transfer
is
completed
now
these
gentlemen
have
underwritten
the
stock
in
the
new
lallapaloosa
company
at
fifty
cents
upon
the
dollar
and
if
this
nefarious
deal
is
permitted
to
go
through
they
will
thus
acquire
a
property
worth
ten
millions
for
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
which
they
will
use
only
one
hundred
and
thousand
in
payment
of
old
indebtedness
in
effect
they
confiscate
the
equity
of
all
the
minority
stockholders
in
horse
neck
who
can
not
afford
to
subscribe
for
stock
in
lallapaloosa
he
turned
upon
the
uncomfortable
tall
hats
with
an
arraigning
eye
in
the
criminal
courts
your
honor
such
a
conspiracy
would
be
properly
described
as
grand
larceny
in
wall
street
perchance
it
may
be
viewed
as
high
finance
but
so
long
as
there
are
courts
of
equity
such
a
wrong
upon
a
helpless
stockholder
will
not
go
unrebuked
have
i
made
myself
clear
to
your
honor
judge
pollak
looked
interested
he
was
a
man
famous
for
his
protection
of
helpless
minorities
and
his
court
had
been
selected
by
tutt
on
this
account
if
the
facts
are
as
you
state
them
tutt
he
answered
seriously
the
plan
on
its
face
would
seem
to
be
inequitable
if
the
property
is
worth
ten
million
the
consideration
is
palpably
inadequate
your
client
equity
worth
on
that
basis
at
least
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
would
be
entirely
destroyed
without
any
redress
your
honor
burst
out
chippingham
whose
bald
head
had
been
bobbing
about
in
excited
contiguity
with
the
tall
hats
this
is
a
most
misleading
statement
the
assets
of
horse
neck
are
worth
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
if
any
of
the
minority
do
want
to
come
into
the
reorganization
and
i
assure
your
honor
that
we
would
welcome
their
participation
they
can
have
their
equity
appraised
under
the
laws
of
delaware
and
the
finding
becomes
a
lien
on
the
assets
even
after
they
have
been
transferred
what
relief
does
that
give
a
man
like
mr
barrows
shouted
tutt
he
ca
afford
to
go
down
to
wilmington
with
a
carload
of
books
and
a
corps
of
experts
to
prove
the
value
of
horse
neck
it
would
cost
him
more
than
his
stock
is
worth
that
remedy
is
not
exclusive
in
any
event
declared
the
judge
if
this
complainant
is
going
to
be
defrauded
i
will
enjoin
this
contract
and
appoint
a
receiver
your
honor
protested
chippingham
in
great
agony
it
is
not
the
fact
that
this
mine
is
worth
ten
million
it
is
worth
at
the
most
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
it
is
full
of
water
the
machinery
is
rusted
and
falling
to
pieces
and
the
workings
are
practically
exhausted
the
only
way
to
rehabilitate
this
property
is
for
everybody
to
come
in
and
put
up
enough
money
by
subscribing
to
the
stock
of
the
new
corporation
to
pump
it
out
buy
new
engines
and
start
producing
again
is
it
fair
to
the
majority
who
are
willing
to
go
on
put
up
more
money
and
make
an
attempt
to
save
the
property
to
have
this
complainant
an
who
never
paid
a
cent
for
his
stock
dug
up
from
heaven
knows
where
enjoin
their
contract
and
throw
the
corporation
into
the
hands
of
a
receiver
this
is
nothing
but
a
strike

he
waved
it
threateningly
at
the
tall

a
circular
issued
by
these
directors
less
than
five
years
ago
in
which
they
give
the
itemized
value
of
this

as

was

market
at

ninety

him
to
take
all
the
responsibility
and
give
them
a
clean
slate
the
nerve
of
it
to
hell
with
them
suddenly
he
began
to
cry
shockingly
with
deep
stertorous
suspirations
no
you
wo
he
hiccuped
you
sha
lay
the
blame
on
me
i
tell
the
truth
i
will
i
wo
stand
for
it
your
honor
they
want
to
reorganize
horse
neck
because
they
think
there
a
vein
in
amphalula
that
crosses
one
of
the
old
workings
and
that
it
make
the
property
worth
millions
and
millions
utter
silence
descended
upon
the
court
room
silence
broken
only
by
the
slow
ticktack
of
the
clock
on
the
rear
wall
and
the
whine
of
the
electric
cars
on
park
row
one
of
the
tall
hats
crept
quietly
to
the
door
and
vanished
the
others
sat
like
images
then
the
court
said
very
quietly
i
will
adjourn
this
matter
for
one
week
i
need
not
point
out
that
what
has
occurred
has
a
very
grave
interpretation
adjourn
court
old
doc
barrows
the
two
tutts
and
miss
wiggin
were
sitting
in
tutt
office
an
hour
later
when
willie
announced
that
tobias
greenbaum
was
outside
and
would
like
an
interview
send
him
in
directed
tutt
winking
at
miss
wiggin
greenbaum
entered
frowning
and
without
salutation
while
doc
partially
rose
moved
by
the
acquired
instinct
of
disciplinary
politeness
then
changed
his
mind
and
sat
down
again
see
here
snarled
greenbaum
you
sure
have
made
a
most
awful
hash
of
this
business
i
do
want
to
argue
about
it
we
could
go
ahead
and
beat
you
but
pollak
is
prejudiced
and
will
probably
give
you
your
injunction
and
appoint
a
receiver
if
he
does
that
will
knock
the
whole
property
higher
than
a
kite
nobody
would
ever
buy
stock
in
it
or
even
finance
it
now
how
much
do
you
want
to
call
off
your
suit
have
a
stogy
asked
tutt
politely
nope
we
want
exactly
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
greenbaum
laughed
derisively
a
hundred
thousand
fiddlesticks
this
old
jailbird
swindled
another
crook
bloom
oh
bloom
was
a
crook
too
was
he
chuckled
tutt
he
worked
for
your
firm
did
he
that
nothing
to
do
with
it
retorted
greenbaum
angrily
your
swindling
client
traded
some
bum
stock
in
a
fake
corporation
for
stock
which
he
received
for
bona
fide
services
like
elderberry
inquired
tutt
innocently
your
man
never
paid
a
cent
for
his
holdings
that
alone
would
throw
him
out
of
court
the
mine
is
worth
a
cent
without
the
amphalula
vein
we
taking
a
big
chance
you
got
us
down
and
we
got
to
pay
but
we
pay
only
ten
thousand
dollars
that
final
i
ai
any
more
of
a
swindler
than
you
be
said
doc
with
plaintive
indignation
what
do
you
wish
to
do
mr
barrows
asked
tutt
turning
to
him
deferentially
i
leave
it
entirely
to
you
tutt
it
your
stock
i
gave
it
all
to
you
months
ago
then
answered
tutt
with
fine
scorn
i
shall
tell
this
miserable
cheating
rogue
and
rascal
either
to
pay
you
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
or
go
to
hell
tobias
greenbaum
clenched
his
fists
and
cast
a
black
glance
upon
the
group
you
can
wreck
this
corporation
if
you
choose
you
bunch
of
dirty
blackmailers
but
you
get
not
a
cent
more
than
ten
thousand
for
the
last
time
will
you
take
it
or
not
tutt
rose
and
pointed
toward
the
door
kindly
remove
yourself
before
i
call
the
police
he
said
coldly
i
advise
the
firm
of
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
to
retain
criminal
counsel
your
ten
thousand
may
come
in
handy
for
that
purpose
tobias
greenbaum
went
and
now
miss
wiggin
how
about
a
cup
of
tea
said
tutt
the
firm
of
tutt
tutt
claimed
to
be
the
only
law
firm
in
the
city
of
new
york
which
still
maintained
the
historic
english
custom
of
having
tea
at
five
whether
the
claim
had
any
foundation
or
not
the
tea
was
none
the
less
an
institution
undoubtedly
generating
a
friendly
sociable
atmosphere
throughout
the
office
and
now
willie
pulled
aside
the
screen
in
the
corner
and
disclosed
the
table
over
which
miss
wiggin
exercised
her
daily
prerogative
soon
the
room
was
filled
with
the
comfortable
odor
of
pekoe
of
muffins
toasted
upon
an
electric
heater
of
cigarettes
and
stogies
yet
there
was
and
had
been
ever
since
their
conversation
about
the
hat
a
certain
restraint
between
miss
wiggin
and
tutt
rising
presumably
out
of
her
suggestion
that
his
course
savored
of
blackmail
however
justified
it
had
afterward
turned
out
to
be
my
is
this
nice
murmured
doc
trying
unsuccessfully
to
eat
a
muffin
drink
his
tea
and
do
justice
to
a
stogy
at
the
same
time
so
homy
now
is
it
doc
answered
tutt
did
you
really
want
that
ten
thousand
me
repeated
doc
vaguely
why
i
told
you
i
gave
that
stock
to
you
long
ago
it
is
mine
any
longer
besides
i
do
want
any
money
i
perfectly
happy
as
i
am
tutt
laughed
genially
oh
well
he
said
it
no
matter
who
owns
it
elderberry
just
telephoned
me
that
he
had
received
a
telegram
from
the
amphalula
that
the
vein
had
definitely
run
out
it
all
over
including
the
shouting
elderberry
telephone
you
queried
miss
wiggin
in
astonishment
yes
elderberry
you
see
he
done
he
says
with
scherer
hunn
greenbaum
beck
wants
to
turn
state
evidence
and
put
all
in
jail
i
said
i
help
him
then
why
did
you
take
the
ten
thousand
and
call
it
quits
while
the
getting
was
good
demanded
his
partner
icily
because
i
knew
i
never
get
the
ten
anyway
replied
tutt
greenbaum
would
have
learned
about
the
vein
on
his
return
to
the
office
well
i
must
be
getting
along
back
to
pottsville
mumbled
doc
this
has
been
a
very
pleasant
trip
very
pleasant
and
quite
quite
exciting
i
what
i
like
to
know
tutt
interrupted
miss
wiggin
is
how
you
justify
your
course
in
this
matter
when
you
attempted
to
block
this
proposed
reorganization
you
knew
nothing
about
the
elderberry
circular
of
valuing
the
property
at
ten
million
or
of
the
amphalula
vein
on
its
face
you
were
attempting
to
wreck
a
perfectly
honest
piece
of
financiering
and
unless
it
was
a
strike
suit
which
i
hope
and
pray
it
was
strike
suit
protested
tutt
with
a
slight
twinkle
in
his
eye
how
can
you
suggest
such
a
thing
did
the
events
demonstrate
the
wisdom
of
my
judgment
but
you
did
know
what
was
going
to
happen
when
you
began
your
suit
she
argued
firmly
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
should
think
that
if
everything
had
not
come
out
just
as
it
has
your
motives
might
easily
have
been
misconstrued
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
with
me
my
dear
declared
tutt
solemnly
just
to
show
there
no
ill
feeling
wo
you
give
me
another
cup
of
tea
