the
explanations
concerning
the
reasons
of
my
going
to
sea
as
i
do
not
desire
to
forfeit
your
kind
patience
by
letting
this
story
stand
enough
if
i
say
that
after
i
had
been
fairly
well
grounded
in
english
arithmetic
and
the
like
which
plain
education
i
have
never
wearied
of
improving
by
reading
everything
good
that
came
in
my
way
i
was
bound
apprentice
to
a
respectable
man
named
joshua
cox
of
whitby
and
served
my
time
in
his
vessel
the
laughing
susan
a
brave
nimble
brigantine
we
traded
to
riga
stockholm
and
baltic
ports
and
often
to
rotterdam
where
having
a
quick
ear
which
has
sometimes
served
me
for
playing
upon
the
fiddle
for
my
mates
to
dance
or
sing
to
i
picked
up
enough
of
dutch
to
enable
me
to
hold
my
own
in
conversing
with
a
hollander
or
hans
butterbox
as
those
people
used
to
be
called
that
is
to
say
i
had
sufficient
words
at
command
to
qualify
me
to
follow
what
was
said
and
to
answer
so
as
to
be
intelligible
the
easier
since
uncouth
as
that
language
is
there
is
so
much
of
it
resembling
ours
in
sound
that
many
words
in
it
might
easily
pass
for
portions
of
our
tongue
grossly
and
ludicrously
articulated
why
i
mention
this
will
hereafter
appear
when
my
apprenticeship
term
had
expired
i
made
two
voyages
as
second
mate
and
then
obtained
an
appointment
to
that
post
in
a
ship
named
the
saracen
for
a
voyage
to
the
east
indies
this
was
i
was
then
years
of
age
a
tall
young
fellow
with
tawny
hair
of
the
mariner
complexion
from
the
high
suns
i
had
sailed
under
and
the
hardening
gales
i
had
stared
into
with
dark
blue
eyes
filled
with
the
light
of
an
easy
and
naturally
merry
heart
white
teeth
very
regular
and
a
glad
expression
as
though
forsooth
i
found
something
gay
and
to
like
in
all
that
i
looked
at
indeed
it
was
a
saying
with
my
mother
that
geff
meaning
geoffrey
that
appearance
was
as
though
a
very
little
joke
would
set
the
full
measure
of
his
spirits
overflowing
but
now
it
is
as
an
old
poet
finely
wrote
my
golden
locks
time
hath
to
silver
turn
o
time
too
swift
and
swiftness
never
ceasing
my
youth
age
and
age
at
youth
have
spurn
but
spurn
in
vain
and
here
it
is
but
right
to
myself
that
i
should
say
though
as
a
sailor
i
am
but
an
obscure
person
yet
as
a
man
i
may
claim
some
pride
and
lustre
of
descent
an
ancestor
being
no
less
a
worthy
than
one
of
the
boldest
of
queen
elizabeth
and
generals
edward
fenton
i
mean
who
was
himself
of
a
sound
and
ancient
nottingham
stock
illustrious
for
his
behaviour
against
the
spaniards
in
and
for
his
explorations
of
the
hidden
passage
of
the
north
sea
mentioned
with
other
notable
matters
in
the
latin
inscription
upon
his
monument
by
richard
earl
of
cork
who
married
his
niece
but
enough
of
such
parish
talk
the
master
of
the
saracen
was
one
jacob
skevington
and
the
mate
name
christopher
hall
we
sailed
from
gravesend
for
with
whitby
i
was
now
done
in
the
month
of
april
we
were
told
to
look
to
ourselves
when
we
should
arrive
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
for
it
was
rumoured
that
the
dutch
with
the
help
of
the
french
were
likely
to
send
a
squadron
to
recover
cape
town
that
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
british
in
the
previous
september
however
at
the
time
of
our
lifting
our
anchor
off
gravesend
the
cape
settlement
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
whatever
danger
there
might
be
there
was
too
remote
to
cast
the
least
faint
shadow
upon
us
besides
the
sailor
was
so
used
to
the
perils
of
the
enemy
and
the
chase
that
nothing
could
put
an
element
of
uneasiness
into
his
plain
shipboard
life
short
of
the
assurance
of
his
own
or
his
captain
eyes
that
the
sail
that
had
hauled
his
wind
and
was
fast
growing
upon
the
was
undeniably
an
enemy
ship
heavily
armed
and
big
enough
to
cannonade
him
into
staves
so
with
resolved
spirits
which
many
of
us
had
cheered
and
heartened
by
a
few
farewell
drams
for
of
all
parts
of
the
seafaring
life
the
saying
to
those
we
love
and
whom
the
god
of
heaven
alone
knows
whether
we
shall
ever
clasp
to
our
breasts
again
is
the
hardest
we
plied
the
capstan
with
a
will
raising
the
anchor
to
a
chorus
that
fetched
an
echo
from
the
river
banks
up
and
down
the
reach
and
then
sheeting
home
our
topsails
dragging
upon
the
halliards
with
piercing
songs
we
gathered
the
weight
of
the
pleasant
sunny
wind
into
those
spacious
hollows
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
started
upon
our
long
journey
yet
though
my
parting
with
my
friends
had
not
been
of
a
nature
to
affect
my
spirits
and
though
i
was
accounted
to
be
and
indeed
was
a
merry
careless
fellow
i
was
sensible
of
an
unaccountable
depression
as
amidst
the
duties
which
occupied
me
i
would
cast
glances
at
the
houses
of
gravesend
and
the
shore
sliding
by
and
hear
in
momentary
hushes
tremulous
tinkling
sounds
raised
by
the
water
wrinkling
under
our
round
and
pushing
bows
chapter
ii
we
meet
and
speak
the
lovely
nancy
snow
for
days
and
days
after
we
had
cleared
the
channel
and
entered
upon
those
deep
waters
which
off
soundings
sway
in
brilliant
blue
billows
sometimes
paling
into
faint
azure
or
weltering
in
dyes
as
purely
dark
as
the
violet
according
as
the
mood
of
the
sky
is
nothing
whatever
of
consequence
befell
we
were
forty
of
a
company
captain
skevington
was
a
stout
but
sedate
sailor
who
had
used
the
sea
for
many
years
and
had
confronted
so
many
perils
there
was
scarce
an
you
could
name
about
which
he
could
not
talk
from
personal
experience
he
was
likewise
a
man
of
education
and
intelligence
with
a
manner
about
him
at
times
not
very
intelligible
though
his
temper
was
always
excellent
and
his
skill
as
a
seaman
equal
to
every
call
made
upon
it
we
carried
six
and
four
brass
swivels
and
a
plentiful
store
of
and
ammunition
our
ship
was
five
years
old
a
good
sailer
handsomely
found
in
all
respects
of
sails
and
tackling
so
that
any
prospect
we
might
contemplate
of
falling
in
with
privateers
and
such
gentry
troubled
us
little
since
with
a
brave
ship
and
nimble
heels
high
hot
hearts
english
cannon
and
jolly
british
beef
for
the
working
of
them
the
mariner
need
never
doubt
that
the
lord
will
own
him
wherever
he
may
go
and
whatever
he
may
do
we
crossed
the
equator
in
longitude
thirty
degrees
west
then
braced
up
to
the
trade
wind
that
heeled
us
with
a
brisk
gale
in
five
degrees
south
latitude
and
so
skirted
the
sea
in
that
great
african
bight
cape
palmas
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
formerly
called
and
very
properly
i
think
the
ethiopic
ocean
for
though
to
be
sure
it
is
all
atlantic
ocean
yet
methinks
it
is
as
fully
entitled
to
a
distinctive
appellation
as
is
the
bay
of
biscay
that
is
equally
one
sea
with
that
which
rolls
into
it
one
morning
in
july
we
being
then
somewhat
south
of
the
latitude
of
the
island
of
helena
a
seaman
who
was
on
the
hailed
the
deck
and
cried
out
that
there
was
a
sail
right
ahead
it
was
an
inexpressibly
bright
morning
the
sun
had
been
risen
two
hours
and
he
stood
a
white
flame
of
the
blinding
and
burning
brilliance
he
seems
to
catch
up
from
the
dazzling
sands
of
africa
as
he
soars
over
them
in
a
sky
of
the
most
dainty
sapphire
fairness
not
a
cloud
no
not
so
big
as
a
fading
wreath
of
tobacco
smoke
anywhere
visible
so
that
the
ends
of
the
sea
went
round
with
the
clearness
of
the
circle
of
a
glass
table
only
that
a
small
wind
very
sweet
and
pleasant
to
every
sense
blowing
a
little
off
our
starboard
bow
fluttered
the
ocean
into
a
sort
of
hovering
look
and
its
trembling
caused
the
wake
of
the
sun
to
resemble
the
leaping
and
frolicking
of
shoals
of
wet
and
sparkling
mackerel
we
waited
with
much
expectation
and
some
anxiety
for
the
stranger
to
approach
near
enough
to
enable
us
to
gather
her
character
or
even
her
nationality
for
the
experienced
eye
will
always
observe
a
something
in
the
ships
of
the
dutch
and
french
nations
to
distinguish
the
flags
they
belong
to
it
was
soon
evident
that
she
was
standing
directly
for
us
shown
by
the
speed
with
which
her
sails
rose
but
when
her
hull
was
fairly
exposed
captain
skevington
after
a
careful
examination
of
her
declared
her
to
be
a
vessel
of
about
one
hundred
tons
probably
a
snow
her
mainmast
being
in
one
with
her
foremast
and
so
we
stood
on
leaving
it
to
her
to
be
wary
if
she
chose
whether
she
had
at
once
made
sure
of
us
as
an
honest
trader
i
can
not
say
she
never
budged
her
helm
by
so
much
as
the
turn
of
a
spoke
but
came
smoothly
along
a
very
pretty
shining
object
rolling
on
the
soft
swell
in
such
a
way
as
to
dart
shadows
across
the
moonlike
gleaming
of
her
canvas
with
the
breathings
of
their
full
bosoms
so
that
the
sight
reminded
me
of
the
planet
venus
as
i
once
beheld
her
after
she
had
passed
from
the
tincture
of
the
ruby
into
the
quick
light
of
the
diamond
lightly
troubled
by
the
swift
passage
of
a
kind
of
gossamer
scud
as
though
the
winds
on
high
sought
to
clothe
her
naked
beauty
with
a
delicate
raiment
of
their
own
wearing
from
which
she
was
forever
escaping
into
the
liquid
indigo
she
loves
to
float
in
after
a
little
the
english
ensign
was
seen
to
flutter
at
her
to
this
signal
we
instantly
replied
by
hoisting
our
colour
and
shortly
after
midday
arriving
abreast
of
each
other
we
backed
our
she
doing
the
like
and
so
we
lay
steady
upon
the
calm
sea
and
so
close
that
we
could
see
the
faces
of
her
people
over
the
rail
and
hear
the
sound
though
not
the
words
of
the
voice
of
the
master
giving
his
orders
it
was
captain
skevington
intention
to
board
her
as
he
suspected
she
was
from
the
indies
and
capable
therefore
of
giving
us
some
hints
concerning
the
dutch
into
whose
waters
in
a
manner
of
speaking
we
were
now
entering
accordingly
the
jolly
boat
was
lowered
and
pulled
away
for
the
stranger
that
proved
to
be
the
snow
lovely
nancy
of
plymouth
name
of
cruel
omen
as
i
shall
always
deem
it
though
i
must
ever
love
the
name
of
nancy
as
being
that
of
a
sister
who
died
in
her
fifteenth
year
as
many
of
my
readers
may
not
be
acquainted
with
sea
terms
it
may
be
fit
to
say
here
that
a
snow
is
nothing
more
than
a
brig
with
the
trifling
addition
of
a
thin
mast
abaft
her
mainmast
upon
which
her
trysail
or
boom
mainsail
sets
i
guess
these
vessels
will
always
bear
this
name
until
their
go
out
of
fashion
but
to
return
i
know
not
why
i
should
have
stood
looking
very
longingly
at
that
plymouth
ship
whilst
our
captain
was
on
board
her
for
though
to
be
sure
we
had
now
been
at
sea
since
april
whilst
she
was
homeward
bound
yet
i
was
well
satisfied
with
the
saracen
and
all
on
board
i
was
glad
to
be
getting
a
living
and
earning
in
wages
money
enough
to
put
away
my
dream
being
to
save
so
much
as
would
procure
me
an
interest
in
a
ship
for
out
of
such
slender
beginnings
have
sprung
many
renowned
merchant
princes
in
this
country
but
so
it
was
my
heart
yearned
for
that
snow
as
though
i
had
a
sweetheart
on
board
even
hall
the
mate
a
plain
literal
practical
seaman
with
as
much
sentiment
in
him
as
you
may
find
in
the
first
dutchman
you
meet
in
the
amsterdam
even
he
noticed
my
wistful
eyes
and
clapping
me
on
the
back
cries
out
why
fenton
my
lad
i
believe
you
be
glad
to
go
home
in
that
little
wagon
yonder
if
the
captain
would
let
ye
i
believe
i
would
sir
i
replied
and
yet
if
i
could
i
do
know
that
i
would
either
he
laughed
and
turned
away
ridiculing
what
he
reckoned
a
piece
of
sentiment
and
that
it
was
no
more
i
daresay
i
was
as
sure
as
he
though
i
wished
the
depression
at
the
devil
for
it
caused
me
to
feel
whilst
it
was
on
me
as
though
a
considerable
slice
of
my
manhood
had
slipped
away
overboard
it
is
one
of
the
few
pleasures
time
permits
to
old
men
to
recall
the
sweet
or
gay
or
fair
pictures
which
charmed
them
when
young
and
which
of
all
our
faculties
is
more
wonderful
as
a
piece
of
mechanism
and
more
divine
in
its
properties
than
memory
which
enables
the
spirit
to
quicken
dust
that
has
lain
for
many
years
in
the
womb
of
time
to
attire
it
and
to
return
to
it
its
passions
emotions
and
all
other
qualities
to
put
back
the
cycles
the
sun
has
run
and
oblige
him
to
shine
on
forms
which
were
then
infants
but
are
now
ridges
on
houses
then
stately
but
now
long
since
swept
away
on
meadows
and
orchards
then
bright
with
daisies
ruddy
with
fruit
but
now
covered
with
houses
and
busy
streets
whose
sidewalks
echo
to
the
tread
of
generations
more
in
that
past
to
which
the
aged
eye
turns
than
ever
can
be
the
dead
who
then
lived
is
thus
when
i
think
of
that
plymouth
snow
for
leaning
back
in
my
chair
and
closing
these
eyes
that
morning
shines
all
around
me
the
tremulous
sea
of
blue
of
a
satin
sheen
in
its
tiny
ripplings
shot
with
milder
tints
where
the
currents
run
as
though
they
were
the
thin
fingers
of
the
wind
toying
with
the
bosom
of
the
deep
bends
to
the
distant
sky
upon
whose
lowermost
reaches
it
flings
the
same
opal
lustre
it
gathers
at
its
horizon
the
air
blows
fitfully
like
the
warm
breathings
from
a
woman
sweet
lips
and
sometimes
stills
our
sails
and
sometimes
suffers
them
to
flutter
in
sounds
soothing
as
the
murmurs
of
a
midsummer
night
breeze
amid
the
high
branches
of
a
sleeping
oak
the
snow
had
black
sides
but
was
painted
white
from
her
and
though
there
was
no
lack
of
draining
weeds
and
clustered
shells
upon
her
bilge
and
run
yet
with
every
slow
roll
from
us
the
wet
whiteness
taking
the
meridian
effulgence
broke
out
in
a
glory
as
of
virgin
silver
enriched
by
the
marine
adhesions
into
the
very
likeness
of
a
resplendent
mosaic
of
precious
metal
and
green
glass
such
magic
has
the
sea
to
beautify
whatever
it
is
permitted
to
possess
long
enough
for
its
powers
of
enrichment
to
work
their
way
her
canvas
flashed
out
of
shadow
into
brightness
with
every
lift
of
the
swell
the
ripples
ran
a
dissolving
tracery
along
her
bends
as
dainty
to
see
as
the
choicest
lace
the
faces
of
her
men
looked
at
us
over
the
stout
that
was
broken
by
a
few
open
ports
through
which
you
spied
the
mouths
of
little
cannon
and
it
was
laughable
to
mark
her
figurehead
that
represented
an
admiral
in
a
cocked
hat
a
cheap
dockyard
purchase
no
doubt
for
the
effigy
was
ridiculously
out
of
character
and
foolishly
too
big
for
the
vessel
bowing
to
the
blue
surface
that
flowed
in
lines
of
azure
light
to
the
cutwater
as
though
there
were
some
mermaid
there
to
whom
he
would
be
glad
to
make
a
leg
as
the
old
saying
was
chapter
iii
the
captain
and
i
talk
of
the
death
ship
after
or
thereabouts
captain
skevington
returned
we
then
trimmed
to
our
course
again
and
ere
long
the
plymouth
snow
was
astern
of
us
rolling
her
spread
of
canvas
in
a
saluting
way
that
was
like
a
flourish
of
farewell
whilst
the
jolly
boat
was
being
hoisted
the
captain
stood
gazing
at
the
snow
with
a
very
thoughtful
face
and
then
burying
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
took
several
turns
up
and
down
the
deck
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
whole
manner
not
a
little
grave
he
presently
went
to
the
mate
and
talked
with
him
but
it
looked
as
though
hall
found
little
to
raise
concern
in
what
the
captain
said
as
he
often
smiled
and
once
or
twice
broke
into
a
laugh
that
seemed
to
provoke
a
kind
of
remonstrance
from
the
master
who
yet
acted
as
though
he
were
but
half
in
earnest
too
but
they
stood
too
far
away
for
me
to
catch
a
syllable
of
their
talk
it
was
my
watch
below
at
eight
that
evening
i
was
sitting
alone
in
the
cabin
sipping
a
glass
of
rum
and
water
ready
to
go
to
bed
when
i
had
swallowed
the
dose
there
was
but
one
lamp
hanging
from
a
midship
beam
and
the
cabin
was
somewhat
darksome
the
general
gloom
was
deepened
by
the
bulkhead
being
of
a
sombre
walnut
colour
without
any
relief
such
as
probably
would
have
been
furnished
had
we
carried
passengers
from
or
silver
or
such
furniture
i
mention
these
matters
because
they
gave
their
complexion
to
the
talk
i
am
now
to
repeat
presently
down
into
this
interior
through
the
companion
hatch
comes
captain
skevington
i
drained
my
glass
and
rose
to
withdraw
stop
a
minute
fenton
says
he
what
have
you
been
drinking
there
i
told
him
another
drop
ca
hurt
you
said
he
you
have
four
hours
to
sleep
it
off
in
with
which
he
called
to
the
boy
to
bring
him
a
bottle
of
brandy
from
his
cabin
he
bid
me
help
myself
whilst
he
lighted
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
then
said
the
master
of
the
snow
we
met
warns
us
to
keep
a
bright
for
the
dutch
he
told
me
that
yesterday
he
spoke
an
american
ship
that
was
short
of
flour
and
learnt
from
the
yankee
though
how
jonathan
got
the
news
i
do
know
that
a
dutch
squadron
making
for
the
cape
in
charge
of
admiral
lucas
and
that
among
the
ships
is
the
dordrecht
of
guns
and
two
frigates
but
should
we
fall
in
with
them
will
they
meddle
with
us
do
you
think
sir
said
i
beyond
question
he
answered
then
said
i
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
keep
a
sharp
we
have
heels
anyway
he
smoked
his
pipe
with
a
serious
face
as
though
not
heeding
me
then
looking
at
me
steadfastly
he
exclaimed
fenton
you
been
a
bit
of
a
reader
in
your
time
i
believe
did
your
appetite
that
way
ever
bring
you
to
dip
into
magic
necromancy
the
black
art
and
the
like
of
such
stuff
he
asked
me
this
with
a
certain
strangeness
of
expression
in
his
eyes
and
i
thought
it
proper
to
fall
into
his
humour
so
i
replied
that
in
the
course
of
my
reading
i
might
have
come
across
hints
of
such
things
but
that
i
had
given
them
too
little
attention
to
qualify
me
to
reason
about
them
or
to
form
an
opinion
i
recollect
when
i
was
a
lad
said
he
passing
my
answer
by
so
to
speak
hearing
an
old
lady
that
was
related
to
my
mother
tell
of
a
trick
that
was
formerly
practised
and
credited
too
a
person
stood
at
a
grave
and
invoked
the
dead
who
made
answer
i
smiled
thinking
that
only
an
old
woman
would
talk
thus
stop
cried
he
but
without
temper
she
said
it
was
common
for
a
necromancer
to
invoke
and
obtain
replies
but
that
though
answers
were
returned
they
were
not
spoken
by
the
dead
but
by
the
devil
the
proof
being
that
death
is
a
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
that
the
immortal
soul
can
not
inhabit
the
corpse
that
is
mere
dust
that
therefore
the
dead
can
not
speak
themselves
but
that
the
voices
which
seem
to
proceed
from
them
are
uttered
by
the
evil
one
why
the
evil
one
said
i
because
he
delights
in
whatever
is
out
of
nature
and
in
doing
violence
to
the
harmonious
fabric
of
the
universe
that
sounds
like
a
good
argument
sir
said
i
still
smiling
but
continued
he
suppose
the
case
of
men
now
living
though
by
the
laws
of
nature
they
should
have
died
long
since
would
you
say
that
they
exist
as
a
corpse
does
when
invoked
that
is
by
the
possession
and
voice
of
the
devil
or
that
they
are
informed
by
the
same
souls
which
were
in
them
when
they
uttered
their
first
cry
in
this
life
why
sir
i
answered
seeing
that
the
soul
is
immortal
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
go
on
inhabiting
the
clay
it
belongs
to
so
long
as
that
clay
continues
to
possess
the
physical
power
to
be
moved
and
controlled
by
it
that
a
shrewd
view
said
he
seemingly
but
see
here
my
lad
our
bodies
are
built
to
last
three
score
and
ten
years
some
linger
to
an
hundred
but
so
few
beyond
that
every
month
of
continued
being
renders
them
more
and
more
a
sort
of
prodigies
as
the
end
of
a
long
life
approaches
say
a
life
of
ninety
years
there
is
such
decay
such
that
the
whole
frame
is
but
one
remove
from
ashes
now
suppose
there
should
be
men
living
who
are
known
to
be
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
nay
add
an
average
of
forty
to
each
man
and
call
them
one
hundred
and
ninety
years
old
but
who
yet
exhibit
no
signs
of
mortality
would
not
you
say
that
the
bounds
of
nature
having
been
long
since
passed
their
bodies
are
virtually
corpses
imitating
life
by
a
semblance
of
soul
that
is
properly
the
voice
and
possession
of
the
devil
how
about
methusaleh
and
others
of
those
ancient
times
i
talking
of
he
answered
is
like
turning
up
the
soil
to
work
back
into
ancient
history
you
come
across
things
which
there
no
making
anything
of
but
what
man
is
there
now
living
who
has
reached
to
a
cried
i
still
struck
by
his
look
yet
in
spite
of
that
wondering
at
his
gravity
for
there
was
a
determination
in
his
manner
of
reasoning
that
made
me
see
he
was
in
earnest
well
said
he
smoking
very
slowly
the
master
of
that
snow
one
samuel
bullock
of
rotherhithe
whom
i
recollect
as
mate
of
a
privateer
some
time
since
told
me
that
when
he
was
off
the
agulhas
bank
he
made
out
a
sail
upon
his
starboard
bow
braced
up
and
standing
there
was
something
so
unusual
and
surprising
about
her
rig
that
the
probability
of
her
being
an
enemy
went
clean
out
of
his
mind
and
he
held
on
influenced
by
the
sort
of
curiosity
a
man
might
feel
who
follows
a
sheeted
figure
at
night
not
liking
the
job
yet
constrained
to
it
by
sheer
force
of
unnatural
relish
was
the
first
dogwatch
the
sun
drawing
down
but
daylight
was
yet
abroad
when
the
stranger
was
within
hail
upon
their
starboard
quarter
keeping
a
close
luff
yet
points
off
on
account
of
the
antique
fit
of
her
canvas
bullock
as
he
talked
fell
though
no
man
sails
the
ocean
and
i
could
see
the
memory
of
the
thing
working
in
him
like
a
bloody
conscience
he
cried
out
the
bountiful
god
grant
that
my
ship
reaches
home
in
safety
i
said
vessel
was
she
think
you
captain
says
he
but
the
vessel
which
is
god
will
should
continue
sailing
about
these
seas
i
started
to
hear
this
and
asked
if
he
saw
any
of
the
crew
he
replied
that
only
two
men
were
to
be
seen
one
steering
at
a
long
tiller
on
the
poop
deck
and
the
other
pacing
near
him
on
the
weather
side
seized
the
glass
said
he
knelt
down
that
those
i
viewed
should
not
observe
me
and
plainly
catched
the
face
of
him
who
walked
how
did
bullock
describe
him
sir
said
i
he
said
he
wore
a
great
beard
and
was
very
tall
and
that
he
was
like
a
man
that
had
died
and
that
when
dug
up
preserved
his
aspect
he
was
like
such
a
corpse
artificially
animated
and
most
terrible
to
behold
from
his
suggestions
of
i
pressed
him
to
tell
me
more
but
he
is
a
person
scanty
of
words
for
the
want
of
learning
however
his
fears
were
the
clearest
relation
he
could
give
me
of
what
he
had
seen
it
was
the
phantom
ship
he
saw
you
think
sir
said
i
i
am
sure
he
bid
me
dread
the
sight
of
it
more
than
the
combined
navies
of
the
french
and
the
dutch
the
apparition
was
encountered
in
latitude
twenty
miles
south
of
degrees
is
a
spectre
to
be
shunned
fenton
though
it
cost
us
every
rag
of
sail
we
own
to
keep
clear
then
what
you
would
say
captain
said
i
is
that
the
people
who
work
that
ship
have
ceased
to
be
living
men
by
reason
of
their
great
age
which
exceeds
by
many
years
our
bodies
capacity
of
wear
and
tear
and
that
they
are
actually
corpses
influenced
by
the
devil
who
is
warranted
by
the
same
divine
permission
we
find
recorded
in
the
book
of
job
to
pursue
frightful
and
unholy
ends
it
is
the
only
rational
view
he
answered
if
the
phantom
ship
be
still
afloat
and
navigated
by
a
crew
they
can
not
be
men
in
the
sense
that
this
ship
company
are
men
well
sir
said
i
cheerfully
i
reckon
it
will
be
all
one
whether
they
be
fiends
or
flesh
and
blood
miraculously
wrought
to
last
unto
the
world
end
for
it
is
a
million
to
nothing
that
we
do
meet
her
the
southern
ocean
is
a
mighty
sea
a
ship
is
but
a
little
speck
and
once
we
get
the
madagascar
coast
on
our
bow
we
shall
be
out
of
the
death
ship
preserves
however
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
he
maintained
a
very
earnest
posture
of
mind
in
this
matter
to
begin
with
he
did
not
in
the
least
question
the
existence
of
the
dutch
craft
he
had
never
beheld
her
but
he
knew
those
who
had
and
related
tales
of
dismal
issues
of
such
encounters
the
notion
that
the
crew
were
corpses
animated
into
a
mocking
similitude
of
life
was
strongly
infixed
in
his
mind
and
he
obliged
me
to
tell
him
all
that
i
could
remember
of
magical
ghostly
supernatural
circumstances
i
had
read
about
or
heard
of
until
i
noticed
it
was
after
nine
and
that
at
this
rate
my
watch
on
deck
would
come
round
before
i
had
had
a
wink
of
sleep
however
though
i
went
to
my
cabin
it
was
not
to
rest
i
lay
for
nearly
two
hours
wide
awake
no
doubt
the
depression
i
had
marked
in
myself
had
exactly
fitted
my
mind
for
such
fancies
as
the
captain
had
talked
about
it
was
indeed
impossible
that
i
should
soberly
accept
his
extraordinary
view
touching
the
endevilment
of
the
crew
of
the
death
ship
moreover
i
hope
i
am
too
good
a
christian
to
believe
in
that
satyr
which
was
the
coinage
of
crazy
fanatical
heads
in
the
dark
ages
that
foul
fiend
created
to
terrify
the
with
a
vision
of
legs
like
a
beast
a
barbed
tail
flaming
eyes
and
nostrils
discharging
the
sickening
fumes
of
sulphur
but
concerning
the
phantom
ship
herself
the
flying
dutchman
as
she
has
been
styled
is
a
spectre
that
has
too
often
crossed
the
path
of
the
mariner
to
admit
of
its
existence
being
questioned
if
there
be
spirits
on
land
why
not
at
sea
too
there
are
scores
who
believe
in
apparitions
not
on
the
evidence
of
their
own
eyes
they
may
never
have
beheld
such
a
sight
but
on
the
testimony
of
witnesses
sound
in
their
religion
and
of
unassailable
integrity
and
why
should
we
not
accept
the
assurance
of
plain
honest
sailors
that
there
may
be
occasionally
encountered
off
the
agulhas
bank
and
upon
the
southern
and
eastern
coast
of
the
african
extremity
a
wild
and
ancient
fabric
rigged
after
a
fashion
long
fallen
into
disuse
and
manned
by
a
crew
figured
as
presenting
something
of
the
aspect
of
death
in
their
unholy
and
monstrous
vitality
i
turned
this
matter
freely
over
in
my
mind
as
i
lay
in
my
little
cabin
my
thoughts
finding
a
melancholy
musical
setting
in
the
melodious
sobbing
of
water
washing
past
under
the
open
port
and
snatching
distressful
impulses
from
the
gloom
about
me
that
was
rendered
by
the
moon
who
was
climbing
above
our
mastheads
and
clothing
the
vast
placid
scene
outside
with
the
beauty
of
her
icy
light
and
then
at
seven
bells
fell
asleep
but
was
called
later
at
midnight
to
relieve
hall
whose
four
hours
spell
below
had
come
round
chapter
iv
we
are
chased
and
nearly
captured
we
talked
occasionally
of
the
phantom
ship
after
this
for
a
few
days
the
captain
on
one
occasion
to
my
surprise
producing
an
old
volume
on
magic
and
sorcery
which
it
seems
he
had
along
with
an
odd
collection
of
books
in
his
cabin
and
arguing
and
reasoning
out
of
it
but
he
never
spoke
of
this
thing
in
the
presence
of
the
mate
who
to
be
sure
was
a
simple
downright
man
without
the
least
imaginable
flavour
of
imagination
to
render
sapid
the
lean
austerity
of
his
thoughts
and
who
therefore
as
you
may
suppose
as
little
credited
the
stories
told
of
the
dutchman
ship
as
the
ebrew
jew
believes
in
our
lord
hence
as
there
were
but
the
captain
and
me
to
keep
this
shuttlecock
of
a
fancy
flying
it
fluttered
before
long
to
the
ground
perhaps
the
quicker
because
on
the
sunday
following
our
speaking
with
the
plymouth
snow
there
happened
a
piece
of
work
sharp
and
real
enough
to
drive
all
ideas
of
visions
and
phantasms
out
of
our
heads
it
was
ten
in
the
morning
when
a
sail
was
descried
broad
on
the
larboard
beam
we
gave
her
no
heed
at
first
it
being
the
sabbath
and
a
warm
sweet
morning
the
men
having
nothing
to
do
hung
about
the
decks
smoking
telling
stories
and
the
like
and
being
cleanly
attired
in
jackets
and
white
trousers
they
contributed
a
choice
detail
to
the
general
structure
of
decks
shining
brass
work
massive
shrouds
soaring
from
the
black
to
the
great
round
tops
with
further
rigging
of
a
similar
kind
ruling
the
topmasts
to
the
and
on
yet
to
the
topgallant
heights
ropes
crossing
ropes
and
ratline
following
ratline
till
the
tracery
both
in
its
substance
aloft
and
its
shadows
below
and
in
the
inclined
hollows
of
the
sails
puzzled
the
eye
with
the
complexity
of
a
spider
web
whilst
from
the
to
the
lower
and
thence
to
the
ends
of
the
yards
above
mounted
the
vast
sheets
of
canvas
each
central
surface
arching
in
snow
to
the
raining
light
of
the
sun
like
the
fair
full
breasts
of
a
virgin
passed
the
taut
narrowing
as
they
rose
till
the
being
reached
the
sails
there
swelled
yearning
skywards
as
though
they
were
portions
of
the
prismatic
ribbed
and
pearly
beds
of
cloud
directly
over
the
ship
rent
from
them
by
the
sweep
of
our
trucks
and
knitted
by
our
seamen
to
those
lofty
spars
it
was
not
long
however
before
we
made
out
that
the
vessel
down
in
the
eastern
quarter
was
steering
large
and
at
the
time
the
appearance
of
her
canvas
assured
us
of
this
she
slackened
away
her
larboard
braces
to
head
up
for
us
hauling
upon
a
bowline
with
a
suddenness
that
left
her
intention
to
parley
with
us
questionless
we
hoisted
the
english
ensign
and
held
on
a
bit
viewing
her
with
an
intentness
that
brought
many
of
our
eyes
to
a
squint
then
the
captain
observing
that
she
showed
no
colours
and
was
a
big
ship
put
his
helm
up
for
a
run
no
sooner
had
we
braced
in
our
yards
when
the
fellow
behind
us
squared
away
too
and
threw
out
lower
and
topmast
with
a
rapidity
that
satisfied
us
she
was
a
apparently
a
liner
this
notion
joined
to
the
belief
that
she
was
a
dutchman
was
start
enough
for
us
all
our
small
company
were
not
likely
to
hold
their
own
against
the
disciplined
masses
of
a
two
or
three
decker
even
though
she
should
prove
a
spaniard
our
guns
were
too
few
to
do
anything
with
tiers
of
batteries
heavy
enough
to
blow
us
out
of
water
so
as
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
a
fair
trial
of
speed
we
sprung
to
our
work
like
hounds
newly
unleashed
got
her
dead
before
it
ran
out
booms
on
both
sides
and
sent
the
sails
aloft
soaking
wet
for
the
serviceableness
of
the
weight
the
wetness
would
give
and
stationing
men
in
the
tops
and
we
whipped
up
buckets
of
water
to
them
with
which
they
drenched
the
canvas
till
our
cloths
must
have
looked
as
dark
as
a
collier
to
the
ship
astern
of
us
it
was
very
slow
work
at
first
and
we
were
thankful
for
that
for
every
hour
carried
us
nearer
to
the
night
into
which
the
moon
now
entered
so
late
and
glowed
with
such
little
power
even
when
she
had
floated
high
that
we
could
count
after
sundown
upon
several
hours
of
darkness
but
it
was
not
long
before
it
became
evident
to
us
all
that
spite
of
the
ceaseless
wetting
of
our
sails
the
ship
in
our
wake
was
growing
then
satisfied
of
her
superiority
and
convinced
of
our
nationality
she
let
fly
a
forecastle
gun
at
us
of
the
ball
of
which
we
saw
nothing
and
hoisted
the
dutch
colours
at
her
masthead
where
at
all
events
we
could
not
fail
to
distinguish
the
flag
confound
such
luck
cries
skevington
at
this
how
can
our
contend
with
those
pyramids
of
sails
there
what
to
be
done
he
says
as
if
thinking
aloud
it
clear
she
our
master
in
running
and
i
fear
she
be
more
than
our
match
on
a
bowline
with
the
weather
gage
too
and
yet
by
the
thunder
of
heaven
hall
it
does
go
against
the
current
of
any
sort
of
english
blood
to
haul
down
that
piece
of
bunting
there
says
he
casting
his
eyes
at
the
peak
where
our
flag
was
blowing
to
the
command
of
a
dutchman
cannon
the
wind
coming
away
more
easterly
said
the
mate
with
a
slow
turning
of
his
gaze
into
the
quarter
he
mentioned
and
it
be
breezing
up
presently
if
there
any
signification
in
the
darker
blue
of
the
sea
that
way
it
happened
as
he
said
but
the
dutchman
got
the
first
slant
of
it
and
you
saw
the
harder
pulling
of
his
canvas
in
the
rounded
rigidity
of
light
upon
the
cloths
whilst
the
dusky
line
of
the
wind
followed
by
the
flashings
of
the
small
seas
whose
leaping
heads
it
showered
into
spray
was
yet
approaching
our
languid
ship
whose
lower
and
heavy
canvas
often
flapped
in
the
weak
air
a
couple
of
shot
came
flying
after
us
from
the
bowchasers
ere
the
breeze
swept
to
our
spars
and
now
the
silvery
line
of
the
white
water
that
her
stem
was
hewing
up
and
sending
in
a
brilliant
whirl
past
her
was
easy
to
be
seen
aye
was
even
possible
to
make
out
the
very
lines
of
her
upon
the
and
topsail
whilst
through
the
glass
you
could
discern
groups
of
men
stationed
upon
her
forecastle
and
mark
some
figure
now
and
again
impatiently
bound
on
to
the
rail
and
overhang
it
like
a
davit
with
an
arm
round
a
backstay
in
his
eagerness
to
see
how
fast
they
were
coming
up
with
us
with
all
element
of
terror
in
it
extinguished
by
time
it
is
a
sight
to
recall
with
a
sailor
fondness
for
indeed
the
dutchman
was
a
fine
ship
very
tall
with
painted
red
inside
so
that
with
the
guns
projecting
from
them
in
two
tiers
the
aspect
was
that
of
rows
of
crimson
wolfish
jaws
every
beast
with
his
tongue
out
her
yards
were
immensely
square
and
her
booms
extending
great
spaces
of
canvas
far
over
the
side
she
showed
upon
the
dark
blue
frothing
ocean
like
some
hill
fleecily
clad
with
snow
to
twenty
feet
above
the
where
it
was
black
rock
down
to
the
wash
of
the
froth
in
the
freshening
wind
as
it
came
up
to
us
i
seemed
to
catch
an
echo
of
the
roll
of
the
briskening
gale
in
those
airy
heights
and
to
hear
the
seething
of
the
boiling
stuff
at
her
forefoot
but
thanks
be
to
heaven
there
was
now
a
swift
racing
of
foam
from
under
our
counter
whence
it
streamed
away
with
a
noise
delicious
to
hearken
to
as
though
it
was
the
singing
of
the
rain
of
a
upon
hard
land
for
whenever
the
breeze
gathered
its
weight
in
our
canvas
the
saracen
sprang
from
it
and
away
we
sped
with
helm
right
amidships
and
the
wind
flashing
fair
over
the
taffrail
the
excitement
of
this
chase
was
deep
in
us
when
the
captain
gave
orders
to
train
a
couple
of
guns
aft
and
to
continue
firing
at
the
pursuing
craft
which
was
done
the
blowing
like
prodigious
glistening
cobwebs
into
our
canvas
forward
meanwhile
the
english
colours
flew
hardily
at
our
peak
whilst
preventer
guys
were
clapped
on
the
and
other
gear
added
to
give
strength
aloft
for
the
wind
was
increasing
as
if
by
magic
the
ribbed
clouds
had
broken
up
and
large
bodies
of
vapour
were
sailing
overhead
with
many
shoulders
crowding
upon
the
horizon
and
the
strain
upon
the
tacks
was
extremely
heavy
but
you
saw
that
it
was
captain
skevington
intention
to
make
the
saracen
drag
what
she
could
not
carry
and
to
let
what
chose
blow
away
before
he
started
a
whilst
we
had
that
monster
astern
there
sticking
to
our
skirts
and
by
this
time
it
was
manifest
that
with
real
weight
in
the
wind
our
heels
were
pretty
nearly
as
keen
as
hers
which
made
us
hope
that
should
the
breeze
freshen
yet
we
might
eventually
get
away
well
at
three
it
was
blowing
downright
hard
though
the
weather
was
fine
the
heavens
mottled
the
clouds
being
compacted
and
sailing
higher
stormy
in
complexion
and
moving
slowly
the
sea
had
grown
hollow
and
was
most
gloriously
violet
in
colour
with
plumes
of
snow
which
curled
to
the
gale
on
the
head
of
each
liquid
courser
the
sun
was
over
our
and
showered
down
his
glory
so
as
to
form
a
golden
weltering
road
for
us
to
steer
beside
the
ship
behind
catched
his
light
and
looked
to
be
chasing
us
on
wings
of
yellow
silk
but
never
since
her
keel
had
been
laid
had
the
saracen
been
so
driven
the
waters
boiled
up
to
the
blackfaced
turbaned
figure
under
the
bowsprit
and
from
aft
i
could
sometimes
observe
the
glassy
curve
of
the
bow
sea
arching
away
for
fathoms
forward
showing
plain
through
the
headrails
a
couple
of
hands
hung
grinding
upon
the
wheel
with
set
teeth
and
the
sinews
in
their
naked
arms
stood
out
like
cords
others
were
at
the
and
through
it
we
pelted
raising
about
us
a
bubbled
spuming
and
hissing
surface
that
might
have
answered
to
the
passage
of
a
whirlwind
repeatedly
firing
at
the
dutch
when
the
heave
of
the
surge
gave
us
the
chance
and
noticing
the
constant
flash
in
his
bows
and
the
white
smother
that
blew
along
with
him
though
the
balls
of
neither
appeared
to
touch
the
other
of
us
yet
that
we
should
have
been
ultimately
overhauled
and
brought
to
a
stand
i
fully
believe
but
for
a
providential
disaster
for
no
matter
how
dark
the
dusk
may
have
drawn
around
at
sundown
the
dutchman
was
too
close
to
us
to
miss
the
loom
of
the
great
press
of
canvas
we
should
be
forced
to
carry
at
least
so
i
hold
and
then
again
there
was
the
consideration
of
the
wind
failing
us
with
the
coming
of
the
stars
for
we
were
still
in
the
gentle
parallels
but
let
all
have
been
as
it
might
i
had
just
noted
the
wink
of
one
of
the
when
to
my
exceeding
amazement
ere
the
ball
of
smoke
could
be
shredded
into
lengths
by
the
gale
i
observed
the
whole
fabric
of
the
dutchman
towering
foremast
with
the
great
course
swelling
topsail
and
royal
and
the
staysail
and
jibs
melt
away
as
an
icicle
approached
by
flame
and
in
a
breath
it
seemed
the
huge
ship
swung
round
pitching
and
foaming
after
the
manner
of
a
harpooned
whale
with
her
broadside
to
us
exhibiting
the
whole
of
her
most
grievously
and
astonishingly
wrecked
a
mighty
cheer
went
up
from
our
decks
at
the
sight
and
there
was
a
deal
of
clapping
of
hands
and
laughter
captain
skevington
seized
the
telescope
and
talked
as
he
worked
away
with
it
a
rotten
foremast
by
the
thunder
of
heaven
he
cried
using
his
favourite
adjuration
it
could
be
nothing
else
no
shot
our
guns
throw
could
work
such
havoc
by
the
height
that
left
standing
the
spar
has
fetched
away
close
under
the
top
and
the
mess
the
mess
with
the
naked
eye
one
could
see
that
the
foremast
had
broken
in
twain
its
fall
had
snapped
off
the
jibbooms
to
the
bowsprit
cap
and
i
do
not
doubt
a
nearer
view
would
have
shown
us
the
bowsprit
itself
severely
wrenched
i
could
not
imagine
the
like
of
that
picture
of
confusion
her
having
been
set
on
both
sides
drowned
all
her
forward
part
in
canvas
a
goodly
portion
of
which
had
been
torn
into
rags
by
the
fall
immense
stretches
of
sail
lay
in
the
water
sinking
and
rising
with
the
rolling
of
the
ship
and
dragging
her
head
to
the
wind
her
main
topmast
and
all
the
canvas
on
that
mast
and
the
mizzen
the
yards
lying
square
were
shaking
furiously
owing
to
the
posture
in
which
she
had
fallen
every
moment
this
terrible
slatting
threatened
her
other
spars
and
it
needed
not
a
sailor
imagination
to
conceive
how
fearfully
all
that
thunderous
commotion
aloft
must
heighten
the
distracting
tumult
on
deck
the
passionate
volleys
of
commands
the
hollow
shocks
of
seas
smiting
the
inert
hull
the
shouting
of
the
seamen
and
as
we
might
be
sure
the
cries
and
groans
of
the
many
upon
whom
that
soaring
fabric
of
yards
sails
and
rigging
had
fallen
with
the
suddenness
of
an
electric
bolt
from
the
clouds
for
a
whole
hour
after
this
we
touched
not
a
rope
leaving
our
ship
to
rush
from
the
dutchman
straight
as
an
arrow
from
a
bow
but
lord
the
storming
aloft
the
fierce
straining
of
our
canvas
till
tacks
and
guys
sheets
and
braces
rang
out
upon
the
wind
like
the
clanking
of
bells
to
a
strain
upon
them
tauter
than
that
of
the
boiling
noises
of
the
seas
all
about
our
bow
and
under
our
counter
where
the
great
bodies
of
foam
roared
away
into
our
wake
as
the
white
torrent
raves
along
its
bed
from
the
foot
of
a
high
cataract
there
was
an
excitement
in
this
speed
and
triumph
of
escape
from
what
must
have
proved
a
heavy
and
inglorious
disaster
to
us
all
which
put
fire
into
the
blood
and
never
could
i
have
imagined
how
sentient
a
ship
is
how
participant
of
what
stirs
the
minds
of
those
she
carries
until
i
marked
the
magnificent
eagerness
of
our
vessel
flight
her
headlong
domination
of
the
large
billows
which
underran
her
and
the
distention
of
her
sails
reminding
you
of
the
tense
cheeks
of
one
who
holds
his
breath
in
a
run
for
his
life
distance
and
the
sinking
of
the
sun
and
the
shadows
which
throng
sharply
upon
his
heels
in
these
climes
left
the
horizon
in
course
bare
to
our
most
searching
gaze
we
then
shortened
sail
and
under
easy
canvas
we
put
our
helm
and
stood
northwards
on
a
bowline
until
midnight
when
we
rounded
in
upon
our
and
steered
easterly
captain
skevington
suspecting
that
the
dutchman
would
make
all
haste
to
refit
and
head
south
under
some
jury
contrivance
in
the
expectation
that
as
we
were
bound
that
way
when
he
fell
in
with
us
so
we
should
haul
to
our
course
afresh
when
we
lost
sight
of
him
yet
in
the
end
we
saw
him
no
more
and
what
ship
he
was
i
never
contrived
to
learn
but
certainly
it
was
an
extraordinary
escape
though
whether
due
to
our
shot
or
to
his
foremast
being
rotten
or
to
its
having
been
sprung
and
badly
fished
or
to
some
earlier
wound
during
an
engagement
must
be
left
to
conjecture
chapter
we
arrive
at
table
bay
and
proceed
thence
on
our
voyage
but
though
after
this
piece
of
severe
reality
captain
skevington
had
very
little
to
say
about
such
elusive
and
visionary
matters
as
had
before
engaged
us
it
was
clear
from
some
words
which
he
let
fall
that
he
regarded
our
meeting
with
the
dutch
battleship
as
a
sort
of
reflected
from
the
snow
that
had
passed
the
phantom
dutchman
and
the
idea
possessing
him
as
indeed
it
had
seized
upon
me
that
the
lovely
nancy
was
sure
to
meet
with
misadventure
and
might
have
the
power
of
injuring
the
fortune
of
any
vessel
that
spoke
with
her
intimately
as
we
had
caused
him
to
navigate
the
ship
with
extraordinary
wariness
a
man
was
constantly
kept
aloft
to
watch
the
horizon
and
repeatedly
hailed
from
the
deck
that
we
might
know
he
was
awake
to
his
work
other
seamen
were
stationed
on
the
forecastle
at
night
every
light
was
screened
so
that
we
moved
along
like
a
blot
of
liquid
pitch
upon
the
darkness
on
several
occasions
i
heard
captain
skevington
say
that
he
would
sooner
have
parted
with
twenty
guineas
than
have
boarded
or
had
anything
to
do
with
the
snow
happily
the
adventure
with
the
dutchman
led
the
seamen
to
suppose
that
the
master
anxiety
wholly
concerned
the
ships
of
the
enemy
for
had
it
got
forward
that
the
lovely
nancy
had
sighted
craft
off
the
agulhas
i
do
question
that
they
would
have
concluded
our
meeting
with
the
snow
boded
no
good
to
us
that
we
were
likely
ourselves
to
encounter
the
spectral
ship
if
indeed
she
were
a
phantasm
and
not
a
substantial
fabric
as
i
myself
deemed
and
so
perhaps
have
refused
to
work
the
saracen
beyond
table
bay
at
that
settlement
it
was
necessary
we
should
call
for
water
fresh
provisions
and
the
like
and
on
the
sixth
of
july
in
the
year
we
safely
entered
the
bay
and
let
go
our
anchor
nothing
of
the
least
consequence
to
us
having
happened
since
we
were
chased
the
weather
being
fine
with
light
winds
ever
since
the
strong
breeze
before
which
we
had
run
died
away
after
days
of
sea
and
sky
the
meanest
land
would
have
offered
a
noble
refreshment
to
our
gaze
judge
then
of
the
delight
we
found
in
beholding
the
royal
and
ample
scenery
of
as
fair
and
spacious
a
haven
as
this
globe
has
to
offer
but
as
captain
george
shelvocke
in
the
capital
account
he
wrote
of
his
voyage
round
the
world
in
there
points
out
the
cape
of
good
hope
by
which
he
must
intend
table
bay
has
been
so
often
described
that
says
he
i
can
say
nothing
of
it
that
has
not
been
said
by
most
who
have
been
here
before
we
lay
very
quietly
for
a
fortnight
feeling
perfectly
secure
as
you
may
conclude
when
i
tell
you
that
just
round
the
corner
that
is
to
say
in
simon
bay
there
were
anchored
no
less
than
fourteen
british
ships
of
war
in
command
of
sir
george
elphinstone
of
which
two
were
whilst
five
mounted
guns
each
meeting
one
of
the
captains
of
this
squadron
captain
skevington
told
him
how
we
had
been
chased
by
a
dutch
liner
and
he
replied
he
did
not
doubt
it
was
one
of
the
vessels
who
were
coming
to
retake
if
they
could
the
settlement
we
had
captured
from
the
nation
that
had
established
the
place
but
i
do
not
think
the
notion
probable
as
the
dutch
ships
did
not
show
themselves
off
saldanha
bay
for
some
weeks
after
we
had
sailed
this
however
is
a
matter
of
no
moment
whatever
we
filled
our
water
casks
laid
in
a
plentiful
stock
of
tobacco
vegetables
hogs
poultry
and
such
produce
as
the
country
yielded
and
on
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
of
july
hove
short
with
a
crew
diminished
by
the
loss
of
one
man
only
a
boatswain
mate
named
turner
who
because
we
suffered
none
of
the
men
to
go
ashore
for
dread
of
their
deserting
the
ship
slipped
down
the
cable
on
the
night
of
our
departure
and
swam
to
the
beach
naked
with
some
silver
pieces
tied
round
him
in
a
handkerchief
behold
the
character
of
the
sailor
for
a
few
hours
of
such
drunken
jollity
as
he
may
obtain
in
the
tavern
and
amid
low
company
he
will
be
content
to
forfeit
all
he
has
in
the
world
it
was
known
that
this
man
turner
had
a
wife
and
two
children
at
home
dependent
upon
his
earnings
yet
no
thoughts
of
them
could
suppress
his
deplorable
restless
spirit
but
i
afterwards
heard
he
was
punished
even
beyond
his
deserts
for
being
pretty
near
spent
by
his
swim
he
lay
down
to
sleep
but
was
presently
awakened
by
something
crawling
over
him
that
proved
a
venomous
snake
called
a
which
on
his
moving
stung
him
whereof
he
died
it
was
the
stormy
season
of
the
year
off
south
africa
but
then
a
few
days
of
westerly
winds
would
blow
us
into
mild
and
quiet
zones
and
come
what
might
the
ship
we
stood
on
was
stout
and
honest
all
things
right
and
true
aloft
the
hospitably
stocked
and
the
health
of
the
crew
of
the
best
was
a
perfectly
quiet
cheerful
morning
when
we
manned
the
capstan
the
waters
of
the
bay
stretched
in
an
exquisite
blue
calm
to
the
sandy
wastes
on
the
blaawberg
side
and
thence
to
where
the
town
stands
the
atmosphere
had
the
purity
of
the
of
a
perspective
glass
and
the
far
distant
hottentot
holland
mountains
with
summits
so
mighty
that
the
sky
appeared
to
rest
upon
them
gathered
to
their
giant
slopes
such
a
mellowness
and
richness
of
blue
that
they
showed
as
a
dark
atmospheric
dye
which
had
run
and
stained
before
being
stanched
that
part
of
the
heavens
rather
than
as
prodigious
masses
of
land
of
the
usual
complexion
of
mountains
when
viewed
closely
that
imperial
height
called
table
mountain
guarded
by
the
couchant
lion
reared
a
marvellously
clear
and
there
the
firmament
appeared
as
a
flowing
sea
of
blue
flushing
its
full
cerulean
bosom
to
the
flat
altitude
as
though
it
would
overflow
it
but
i
noticed
a
shred
of
crawling
vapour
gather
up
there
whilst
the
crew
were
chorussing
at
the
capstan
and
by
the
time
our
topsails
were
sheeted
home
there
was
a
mass
of
white
vapour
some
hundred
feet
in
depth
foaming
and
churning
atop
with
delicate
wings
of
it
circling
out
into
the
blue
where
they
gyrated
like
butterflies
and
melted
the
air
was
full
of
the
moaning
noises
of
the
wind
flying
out
of
that
cloud
down
the
steep
abrupt
full
of
gorges
scars
and
ravines
and
what
was
just
now
a
picture
of
peace
became
on
a
sudden
a
scene
of
whipped
and
creaming
ripples
and
the
flashing
on
shore
of
the
glass
of
shaken
through
spiral
spirtings
of
reddish
dust
hands
aloft
on
the
various
ships
at
anchor
hastily
furling
the
canvas
that
had
been
loosed
to
hang
idly
to
the
sun
flags
quite
recently
languid
as
streaks
of
paint
now
pulling
fiercely
at
their
halliards
and
malay
darting
across
the
bay
in
a
glittering
of
water
sliced
out
by
their
sharp
stems
and
slung
to
the
strong
wind
under
small
sail
we
stormed
out
toward
the
ocean
with
a
desperate
screaming
of
wind
in
the
rigging
but
there
was
no
sea
for
the
gale
was
off
the
land
and
after
passing
some
noble
and
enchanting
bays
on
whose
shores
the
breakers
as
tall
as
our
ship
flung
their
resounding
atlantic
thunder
whilst
behind
stood
ranges
of
mountains
putting
a
quality
of
solemn
magnificence
into
the
cheerful
yellow
clothing
of
the
sunshine
with
here
and
there
a
small
house
of
an
almond
whiteness
against
the
leaves
of
the
silver
trees
and
sundry
rich
growths
thereabouts
in
a
moment
we
ran
sheer
out
of
the
gale
into
a
light
wind
blowing
from
the
i
do
say
we
were
astonished
since
before
reaching
the
calm
part
we
could
see
it
clearly
defined
by
the
line
where
the
froth
and
angry
blueness
and
the
fiery
agitation
of
the
wind
ended
still
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
surprised
as
the
ship
slipped
out
of
the
enraged
and
yelling
belt
into
a
peaceful
sea
and
a
weak
new
wind
which
obliged
us
to
handle
the
braces
and
make
sail
here
happened
an
extraordinary
thing
as
we
passed
green
point
where
the
weather
was
placid
and
the
strife
waged
in
the
bay
no
longer
to
be
seen
a
large
ship
of
six
hundred
tons
that
we
supposed
was
to
call
at
cape
town
passed
us
her
yards
braced
up
and
all
plain
sail
set
she
had
some
soldiers
aboard
showed
several
guns
had
the
english
colours
flying
and
offered
a
very
brave
and
handsome
show
being
sheathed
with
copper
that
glowed
ruddy
to
the
soft
laving
of
the
swell
and
her
canvas
had
the
hue
of
the
cotton
cloths
which
the
spaniards
of
the
south
american
main
used
to
spread
and
which
in
these
days
form
a
distinguishing
mark
of
the
yankee
ships
having
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
turmoil
that
awaited
her
round
mouille
point
she
slipped
along
jauntily
ready
to
make
a
free
wind
of
the
breeze
then
blowing
but
all
on
a
sudden
on
opening
the
bay
she
met
the
whole
strength
of
the
fierce
down
she
lay
to
it
all
aback
stopped
dead
her
ports
being
open
i
feared
if
she
were
not
promptly
recovered
she
must
founder
they
might
let
go
the
halliards
but
the
yards
being
jammed
would
not
travel
it
swept
the
heart
into
the
throat
to
witness
this
thing
we
brought
our
ship
to
the
wind
to
render
help
with
our
boats
but
happily
her
mizzen
topmast
broke
and
immediately
after
her
main
snapped
short
off
close
to
the
then
though
it
must
have
been
wild
work
on
those
sloping
decks
they
managed
to
bring
the
main
and
topsail
yards
square
whereupon
she
paid
off
righting
as
her
head
swung
from
the
gale
and
with
lightened
hearts
as
may
be
supposed
they
went
to
work
to
let
go
and
clew
up
and
haul
down
whilst
you
saw
how
severe
was
the
need
of
the
pumps
they
had
manned
by
the
bright
streams
of
water
which
sluiced
from
her
sides
it
was
a
cruel
thing
to
witness
this
sudden
wrecking
of
the
beauty
of
a
truly
stately
ship
quietly
swinging
along
over
the
mild
heave
of
the
swell
like
a
handsome
princess
seized
and
torn
by
some
loathsome
monster
as
we
read
of
such
matters
in
old
romances
it
was
like
the
blighting
breath
of
pestilence
upon
some
fair
form
converting
into
little
better
than
a
carcase
what
was
just
now
a
proud
and
regal
shape
made
beauteous
by
all
that
art
could
give
her
of
apparel
and
all
that
nature
could
impart
of
colour
and
lustre
chapter
vi
the
captain
speaks
again
of
the
death
ship
i
had
the
first
watch
on
the
night
of
the
day
on
which
we
left
table
bay
that
is
from
eight
till
midnight
and
at
two
bells
nine
i
was
quietly
pacing
the
deck
full
of
fancies
struck
into
me
by
the
beauty
of
the
stars
among
which
over
the
starboard
hung
the
southern
cross
shining
purely
and
by
the
mild
glory
of
the
moon
that
though
short
of
a
day
or
two
of
being
full
rained
down
a
keen
light
that
had
a
hint
of
rosiness
in
it
when
captain
skevington
came
out
of
the
cabin
and
stepping
up
to
me
stood
a
minute
without
speaking
gazing
earnestly
right
around
the
there
was
a
small
wind
blowing
and
the
ship
under
full
sail
was
softly
pushing
southwards
with
a
pleasant
noise
as
of
the
playing
of
fountains
coming
from
the
direction
of
her
bows
a
quiet
night
fenton
said
the
captain
presently
aye
sir
quiet
indeed
there
been
a
small
show
of
lightning
away
down
in
the
the
wind
hangs
steady
but
a
little
faint
the
sort
of
night
for
meeting
with
the
demon
ship
eh
fenton
cried
he
with
a
laugh
that
did
not
sound
perfectly
natural
there
no
chance
of
such
a
meeting
i
fear
sir
you
fear
well
i
exclaimed
struck
by
his
quick
catching
up
of
me
i
mean
that
as
the
demon
ship
as
you
term
her
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
the
seeing
of
her
would
be
a
mighty
experience
something
big
enough
in
that
way
to
keep
a
man
talking
about
it
all
his
life
god
avert
such
a
meeting
said
he
lifting
his
hat
and
turning
up
his
face
to
the
stars
i
suppose
thought
i
that
our
drawing
close
to
the
seas
in
which
the
phantom
cruises
has
stirred
up
his
superstitious
fears
afresh
did
you
speak
to
any
one
at
cape
town
about
vanderdecken
sir
said
i
no
he
answered
i
had
got
my
bellyfull
from
the
master
of
the
snow
what
is
there
to
ask
whether
others
have
lately
sighted
the
ship
why
yes
i
might
have
inquired
certainly
but
it
did
enter
my
head
tell
ye
what
though
fenton
do
you
remember
our
chat
day
about
bodies
being
endevilled
after
they
pass
an
age
when
by
the
laws
of
great
nature
they
should
die
perfectly
well
sir
now
continued
he
i
was
in
company
a
few
nights
since
where
there
was
one
cornelius
meyer
present
a
person
years
old
but
surprisingly
sound
in
all
his
faculties
his
sight
piercing
his
hearing
keen
memory
tenacious
and
so
forth
he
was
a
dutch
jew
but
his
patriotism
was
coloured
by
the
hue
of
the
flag
flying
at
cape
castle
i
mean
he
would
take
the
king
of
great
britain
and
the
as
they
came
when
he
left
we
talked
of
him
and
this
led
us
to
argue
about
old
age
one
gentleman
said
he
did
not
know
but
that
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
live
to
a
and
said
there
were
instances
of
it
i
replied
out
of
the
bible
where
the
reckoning
was
not
ours
he
answered
out
of
the
bible
and
going
to
a
bookshelf
pulled
down
a
volume
and
read
a
score
of
names
of
men
with
their
ages
attached
i
looked
at
the
book
and
saw
it
was
honestly
written
and
being
struck
by
this
collection
of
extraordinary
examples
begged
the
gentleman
son
who
was
present
to
copy
the
list
out
for
me
which
he
was
so
obliging
as
to
do
i
have
it
in
my
pocket
said
he
and
he
pulled
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
then
going
to
the
hatch
called
to
the
boy
to
bring
a
lamp
on
deck
this
was
done
the
lamp
put
on
the
skylight
and
putting
the
paper
close
to
it
the
captain
read
as
follows
thomas
parr
of
shropshire
died
aged
one
hundred
and
henry
jenkins
of
yorkshire
died
aged
one
hundred
and
james
sands
of
staffordshire
died
aged
one
hundred
and
forty
louisa
truxo
a
negress
in
south
america
was
living
in
and
her
age
was
then
one
hundred
and
i
burst
into
a
laugh
he
smiled
too
and
said
here
in
this
list
are
names
the
highest
being
that
negress
and
the
lowest
one
susannah
hilliar
of
piddington
northamptonshire
who
died
february
aged
one
hundred
the
young
gentleman
who
copied
them
said
they
were
all
honestly
vouched
for
and
wrote
down
a
list
of
the
authorities
which
said
he
peering
and
bringing
the
paper
closer
to
his
eyes
consist
of
worthies
transactions
several
newspapers
such
as
the
post
advertiser
chronicle
and
a
number
of
inscriptions
i
could
have
been
tolerably
sarcastic
i
daresay
when
he
mentioned
the
authority
of
the
newspapers
always
understanding
that
those
sheets
flourish
mainly
on
lies
and
i
should
have
laughed
again
had
i
not
been
restrained
by
the
sense
that
captain
skevington
was
clearly
bitten
on
this
subject
actually
worried
by
it
indeed
to
such
lengths
that
if
he
did
not
mind
his
eye
it
might
presently
push
into
a
delusion
and
earn
him
the
disconcerting
reputation
of
being
a
madman
so
i
thought
i
would
talk
gravely
and
said
may
i
ask
sir
why
you
should
have
been
at
the
pains
to
collect
that
evidence
in
your
hand
about
old
age
a
mere
humour
said
he
lightly
putting
the
paper
away
though
i
do
mind
owning
it
would
prodigiously
gratify
me
if
i
could
be
the
instrument
of
proving
that
men
can
overstep
the
bounds
of
natural
life
by
as
many
years
again
and
yet
possess
their
own
souls
and
be
as
true
to
their
original
as
they
were
when
hearty
young
fellows
flushed
with
the
summer
colours
of
life
some
fine
rhymes
coming
into
my
head
i
exclaimed
cowley
has
settled
that
point
i
think
when
he
says
things
immortal
time
can
do
no
wrong
and
that
which
never
is
to
die
for
ever
must
be
young
a
noble
fancy
indeed
cried
the
captain
he
reflected
a
little
and
said
it
would
make
a
great
noise
among
sailors
and
perhaps
all
men
to
prove
that
the
mariners
who
man
the
death
ship
are
not
ghosts
and
phantoms
as
has
been
surmised
but
survivors
of
a
crew
men
who
have
outlived
their
fellows
and
are
now
extremely
ancient
as
these
and
scores
of
others
who
have
passed
away
unnoticed
have
been
said
he
touching
his
pocket
where
the
paper
was
when
sir
did
vanderdecken
sail
from
batavia
i
asked
i
have
always
understood
about
the
year
he
replied
then
said
i
calculating
suppose
the
average
age
of
the
crew
to
have
been
thirty
when
the
curse
was
uttered
we
name
that
figure
for
the
sake
of
argument
in
the
present
year
of
our
lord
they
will
have
attained
the
age
of
hard
upon
one
hundred
and
eighty
well
said
he
inquiringly
as
though
there
was
yet
food
for
argument
i
shook
my
head
then
he
cried
with
heat
they
are
endevilled
for
it
must
be
one
of
two
things
they
ca
be
dead
men
as
the
corpse
in
the
grave
is
dead
one
could
only
judge
by
seeing
with
one
eyes
said
i
i
hope
that
wo
happen
he
exclaimed
taking
a
hasty
turn
though
i
do
know
i
do
know
a
something
here
pressing
his
brow
weighs
down
upon
me
like
a
warning
i
have
struggled
to
get
rid
of
the
fancy
but
our
being
chased
by
the
dutchman
shows
that
we
did
not
meet
that
plymouth
snow
for
nothing
and
by
the
thunder
of
heaven
fenton
i
fear
i
fear
our
next
bout
will
be
with
the
spectre
his
manner
his
words
a
gleam
in
his
eye
to
which
the
lantern
lent
no
sparkle
sent
a
tremor
through
me
he
caused
me
to
fear
him
for
a
minute
as
one
that
talked
with
certainty
of
futurity
through
stress
of
prophetic
craze
the
yellow
beams
of
the
lantern
dispersed
a
narrow
circle
of
lustre
and
in
it
our
figures
showed
black
each
with
two
shadows
swaying
at
his
feet
from
the
commingling
of
the
lamplight
and
the
moonshine
the
soft
air
stirred
in
the
rigging
like
the
rustle
of
the
pinions
of
invisible
on
the
wing
all
was
silent
and
in
darkness
along
the
decks
save
where
stood
the
figure
of
the
helmsman
just
before
the
little
outlined
by
the
flames
of
the
binnacle
lamp
the
stillness
unbroken
to
the
farthest
corners
of
the
mighty
plain
of
ocean
seemed
as
though
it
were
some
mysterious
spell
wrought
by
the
stars
so
high
it
went
even
so
one
might
say
as
a
sensible
presence
to
the
busy
trembling
faces
of
those
silver
worlds
in
all
men
even
in
the
dullest
there
is
a
vein
of
imagination
whilst
like
an
artery
it
holds
sound
all
is
well
but
sometimes
it
breaks
god
knows
how
for
the
most
part
and
then
what
is
in
it
floods
the
intelligence
often
to
the
drowning
of
it
as
the
bursting
of
a
vessel
of
the
body
within
sickens
or
kills
with
hemorrhage
i
considered
some
such
idea
as
this
to
be
applicable
to
captain
skevington
here
was
apparently
a
plain
sturdy
sailor
qualified
to
the
life
for
such
talk
as
concerns
ships
weather
ladings
and
the
like
yet
it
was
certain
he
was
exceedingly
superstitious
believing
in
such
a
devil
as
the
ancient
monks
figured
forth
also
in
the
possession
of
dead
bodies
by
demons
who
caused
them
to
move
and
act
as
though
operated
upon
by
the
souls
they
came
from
their
mothers
with
with
a
vast
deal
of
other
pitiful
fancies
and
now
through
our
unhappy
meeting
with
that
miserable
snow
he
had
let
his
mind
run
on
the
phantom
ship
so
vehemently
that
he
was
not
only
cocksure
we
should
meet
the
spectre
but
had
reasoned
the
whole
fabric
and
manning
of
her
out
on
two
issues
either
that
her
hands
were
survivors
of
her
original
crew
persons
who
had
cheated
nature
by
living
to
an
age
the
like
of
which
had
not
been
heard
of
since
the
days
of
moses
and
the
prophets
beings
who
like
a
lamp
would
live
to
the
last
wink
and
crawl
upon
the
utmost
verge
of
life
or
that
they
were
mariners
who
having
arrived
at
the
years
when
they
would
have
died
but
for
being
cursed
had
been
seized
upon
by
the
devil
quickened
by
him
and
set
with
their
aspects
upon
them
these
reflections
occupied
my
mind
after
he
had
left
me
and
i
mind
confessing
that
what
with
my
own
belief
in
the
death
ship
coupled
with
the
captain
notions
and
the
fancies
they
raised
in
me
along
with
the
melancholy
vagueness
of
the
deep
hazy
with
moonshine
the
stillness
and
the
sense
of
our
drawing
near
to
where
the
spectre
was
chiefly
to
be
met
i
became
so
uneasy
that
i
contrived
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
watch
on
deck
within
a
few
paces
of
the
wheel
often
addressing
the
helmsman
for
the
sake
of
hearing
his
voice
and
i
tell
you
i
was
mighty
pleased
when
midnight
came
round
at
last
so
that
i
could
go
below
and
dispatch
the
mate
to
a
scene
in
which
his
heavy
mind
would
witness
nothing
but
water
and
sky
and
a
breeze
much
too
faint
to
be
profitable
chapter
vii
i
converse
with
the
ship
carpenter
about
the
death
ship
and
now
for
six
days
it
veritably
seemed
as
if
we
were
to
be
transformed
into
the
marine
phantom
that
unsubstantial
as
she
might
be
yet
lay
with
the
heaviness
of
lead
upon
captain
skevington
for
being
on
the
parallel
of
agulhas
a
little
to
the
south
of
that
latitude
and
in
about
sixteen
degrees
west
longitude
it
came
on
to
blow
fresh
from
the
hardening
after
hours
into
a
whole
gale
with
frequent
and
violent
guns
and
a
veering
of
it
easterly
and
this
continued
with
a
lull
of
an
hour
or
duration
for
six
days
as
i
have
said
was
a
taste
of
cape
weather
strong
enough
to
last
a
man
a
lifetime
the
sea
lay
shrouded
to
within
a
by
a
vapour
of
slatish
hue
that
looked
to
stand
motionless
and
past
the
walls
and
along
the
roof
of
this
wild
dismal
chamber
with
its
floor
of
vaults
and
frothing
brows
the
wind
swept
raving
raising
a
terrible
sea
with
heads
which
seemed
to
rear
to
the
height
of
our
maintop
where
they
broke
and
boiled
like
a
cauldron
with
foam
great
masses
of
which
the
hands
of
the
gale
caught
up
and
hurled
so
that
the
lashing
of
the
spray
was
often
like
a
blinding
snowstorm
but
so
smarting
that
the
wind
was
as
if
charged
with
javelins
look
upon
the
chart
and
you
will
see
that
for
measureless
leagues
there
is
in
these
waters
no
land
to
hinder
the
run
of
the
surges
hence
when
a
fierce
gale
comes
on
from
the
east
south
or
west
the
seas
which
rise
are
prodigious
beyond
such
language
as
i
have
at
command
to
express
we
under
a
storm
staysail
with
struck
yards
on
deck
and
the
lower
yards
stowed
on
the
rail
the
hatches
battened
down
and
everything
as
snug
as
good
seamanship
could
provide
our
decks
were
constantly
full
of
water
by
one
great
sea
that
fell
over
into
the
waist
there
were
drowned
no
less
than
six
of
the
sheep
we
had
taken
in
at
the
cape
with
a
hog
and
many
fowls
the
carpenter
leg
was
broken
by
a
fall
and
an
able
seaman
was
deeply
gashed
in
the
face
by
being
thrown
against
a
scuttlebutt
impossible
to
get
any
food
cooked
and
throughout
that
week
we
subsisted
on
biscuit
cheese
and
such
dry
and
lean
fare
as
did
not
need
dressing
in
short
i
could
fill
a
chapter
with
our
sufferings
and
anxieties
during
that
period
i
had
supposed
that
when
brought
face
to
face
with
the
stern
harsh
prose
of
such
weather
as
this
the
mournful
romantic
stuff
that
filled
the
captain
head
would
have
been
clean
blown
out
of
it
but
no
he
repeatedly
said
to
me
and
i
believe
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
hall
that
he
considered
this
weather
as
part
of
the
that
was
bound
to
come
to
us
from
our
having
spoken
a
vessel
that
had
been
passed
within
hailing
distance
by
the
phantom
ship
on
the
fifth
morning
of
the
gale
the
pair
of
us
being
in
the
cabin
he
informed
me
that
a
man
named
cobwebb
who
was
at
the
helm
the
night
before
had
told
him
that
some
of
the
crew
were
for
putting
this
foul
storm
down
to
one
mulder
or
some
such
name
who
was
a
russian
finn
a
sober
excellent
seaman
and
one
of
the
only
two
foreigners
in
our
forecastle
that
to
neutralise
any
magical
influence
he
might
possess
a
horse
shoe
had
been
nailed
to
the
foremast
and
the
mainmast
pierced
and
scored
with
a
knife
he
smiled
at
these
superstitions
but
did
not
seem
to
suspect
that
his
own
as
being
received
by
a
man
of
thought
and
tolerable
education
might
by
many
be
deemed
much
more
worthy
of
ridicule
but
on
the
sixth
day
the
gale
broke
leaving
our
ship
considerably
strained
by
which
time
in
spite
of
the
current
and
the
send
of
the
sea
we
had
contrived
to
make
forty
miles
of
southing
and
easting
owing
to
our
pertinacity
in
making
sail
and
stretching
away
on
a
board
at
every
lull
it
was
shortly
after
this
on
the
tuesday
following
the
friday
on
which
the
gale
ended
that
it
being
my
watch
on
deck
from
eight
in
the
evening
till
midnight
i
carried
my
pipe
an
hour
before
my
turn
arrived
into
the
carpenter
cabin
which
he
shared
with
the
boatswain
to
give
the
poor
fellow
a
bit
of
my
company
for
his
broken
leg
kept
him
motionless
it
was
the
second
dogwatch
as
we
term
the
time
six
and
eight
at
sea
the
evening
indifferently
fine
the
wind
over
the
starboard
quarter
a
quiet
breeze
the
ocean
heaving
in
a
lazy
swell
from
the
south
and
the
ship
pushing
forward
at
five
knots
an
hour
under
fore
and
the
carpenter
lay
in
a
bunk
wearing
a
haggard
face
and
grizzly
for
lack
of
the
razor
he
was
a
very
sensible
sober
man
a
good
artificer
and
had
served
under
lord
howe
in
the
fleet
equipped
for
the
relief
of
gibraltar
besides
having
seen
a
deal
of
cruising
work
in
earlier
times
he
was
much
obliged
by
my
looking
in
upon
him
and
we
speedily
fell
to
yarning
he
lighted
a
pipe
and
i
smoked
likewise
whilst
i
sat
upon
his
chest
taking
in
with
a
round
such
details
as
a
rude
sketch
of
the
wife
nailed
to
the
bulkhead
the
slush
lamp
swinging
its
dingy
smoking
flame
to
a
cracked
piece
of
over
against
the
carpenter
bed
an
ancient
horny
copy
of
the
bible
with
type
pretty
nigh
as
big
as
the
letters
of
our
ship
name
a
bit
of
a
shelf
wherefrom
there
forked
out
the
stems
of
some
clay
pipes
with
other
humble
furniture
such
as
a
sailor
is
used
to
carry
to
sea
with
him
after
a
little
the
carpenter
whose
name
was
matthews
says
to
me
i
beg
pardon
sir
but
there
some
talk
going
about
among
the
men
concerning
the
old
dutchman
that
was
cursed
last
century
my
mate
joe
marner
told
me
that
jimmy
meaning
the
was
telling
some
of
the
crew
this
morning
that
he
heard
the
captain
say
the
been
sighted
by
anyone
aboard
us
i
asked
mebbe
sir
but
i
did
understand
that
now
as
every
hour
was
carrying
us
further
to
the
eastward
of
the
cape
away
from
the
phantom
and
as
moreover
the
leaving
gossip
to
make
its
own
way
would
surely
in
the
end
prove
more
terrifying
to
the
nervous
and
superstitious
on
board
than
speaking
the
truth
i
resolved
to
tell
matthews
how
the
matter
stood
and
with
that
acquainted
him
with
what
the
master
of
the
snow
had
told
captain
skevington
he
looked
very
grave
and
withdrew
his
pipe
from
his
lips
and
i
noticed
he
did
not
offer
to
light
the
tobacco
afresh
i
sorry
to
hear
this
sir
says
he
but
said
i
what
has
the
lovely
nancy
meeting
with
the
dutchman
got
to
do
with
us
only
this
sir
he
exclaimed
with
his
face
yet
more
clouded
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
as
one
might
in
a
sacred
building
i
never
yet
knew
or
heard
of
a
ship
reporting
to
another
of
having
met
the
dutchman
without
that
other
of
the
ghost
too
afore
she
ended
her
voyage
if
that
be
so
i
cried
not
liking
to
hear
this
for
matthews
had
been
to
sea
for
years
and
he
now
spoke
with
too
much
emotion
not
to
affect
me
for
god
sake
do
make
your
thoughts
known
to
the
crew
and
least
of
all
to
the
captain
who
is
already
so
uneasy
on
this
head
that
when
he
mentions
it
he
talks
as
if
his
mind
were
adrift
fenton
said
the
carpenter
i
never
yet
knew
or
heard
of
a
ship
reporting
to
another
of
having
met
the
dutchman
without
that
other
meeting
the
ghost
too
afore
she
ended
her
voyage
and
thus
speaking
he
smote
his
bed
heavily
with
his
fist
i
was
startled
by
the
emphasis
his
repeating
his
former
words
gave
to
the
assurance
and
smoked
in
silence
he
put
down
his
pipe
and
lay
awhile
looking
at
me
as
though
turning
some
matters
over
in
his
mind
the
swing
of
the
flame
burning
from
the
spout
of
the
lamp
put
various
expressions
wrought
by
the
fluctuating
shadows
into
his
sick
face
and
it
was
this
perhaps
that
caused
his
words
to
possess
a
power
i
could
not
feign
to
you
by
any
art
of
my
pen
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
seen
the
dutchman
and
on
my
answering
no
he
said
that
the
usual
notion
among
sailors
was
that
there
is
but
one
vessel
sailing
the
seas
with
the
curse
of
heaven
upon
her
but
that
that
was
a
mistake
as
it
was
an
error
in
the
same
way
to
suppose
that
this
ocean
from
agulhas
round
to
the
mozambique
was
the
only
place
in
which
the
phantom
was
to
be
met
there
a
ship
said
he
after
the
pattern
of
this
here
dutchman
to
be
found
in
the
baltic
she
always
brings
heavy
weather
and
small
chance
afterwards
for
any
craft
that
sights
her
i
been
trading
in
the
baltic
for
five
years
without
ever
hearing
that
said
i
but
it
true
all
the
same
fenton
you
ask
about
it
sir
when
you
get
back
and
then
you
see
there
another
vessel
of
the
same
pattern
that
to
be
met
down
in
the
mouth
of
the
channel
ushant
and
the
scillies
and
thereabouts
a
man
i
know
called
jimmy
robbins
saw
her
and
told
me
the
yarn
he
was
in
a
ship
bound
home
from
the
spice
islands
they
were
in
soundings
and
heading
round
for
the
channel
it
was
the
morning
watch
just
about
dawn
weather
slightly
thickish
suddenly
a
vessel
comes
heaving
out
of
the
smother
from
god
knows
where
jim
robbins
was
coiling
down
a
rope
alongside
the
mate
who
on
seeing
the
vessel
screams
out
shrill
like
a
woman
and
falls
flat
in
a
swound
jim
looking
saw
it
was
the
channel
death
ship
a
large
pink
manned
by
skeletons
with
a
skull
for
a
figurehead
and
a
skeleton
captain
leaning
against
the
mast
watching
the
running
of
the
sand
in
an
he
held
she
was
seen
by
twelve
others
besides
jim
and
the
mate
who
nearly
died
of
the
fright
and
the
consequence
of
meeting
her
was
that
the
ship
jim
robbins
was
in
was
cast
away
on
the
following
night
on
the
french
coast
down
saint
brihos
way
and
souls
perished
the
gravity
with
which
he
related
this
and
his
evident
keen
belief
in
these
and
the
like
superstitions
now
rendered
the
conversation
somewhat
diverting
for
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
though
i
never
questioned
the
existence
of
the
one
spectral
ship
in
a
belief
in
which
all
mariners
are
united
holding
that
the
deep
which
is
full
of

men
hath
its
spirits
and
its
apparitions
equally
with
the
land
yet
when
it
came
to
such
crude
mad
fancies
as
a
vessel
manned
by
skeletons
why
of
course
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
laugh
which
i
did
heartily
enough
though
in
my
sleeve
for
seamen
are
a
sensitive
people
easily
afronted
more
especially
in
any
article
of
their
faith
however
he
succeeded
before
i
left
him
in
exciting
a
fresh
uneasiness
in
me
by
asseverating
in
a
most
melancholy
voice
and
with
a
very
dismal
face
that
our
having
spoken
with
the
snow
that
had
sighted
the
dutchman
was
certain
to
be
followed
by
misfortune
and
these
being
amongst
the
last
words
he
exchanged
with
me
before
i
left
his
cabin
i
naturally
carried
away
with
me
on
deck
the
damping
and
desponding
impression
of
his
posture
and
appearance
as
he
uttered
them
which
were
those
of
a
man
grieved
bewildered
and
greatly
alarmed
chapter
viii
a
tragical
death
for
some
time
after
i
had
relieved
the
deck
as
it
is
termed
that
is
to
say
after
the
mate
had
gone
below
and
left
me
in
charge
i
had
the
company
of
the
captain
who
seemed
restless
and
troubled
often
quitting
my
side
as
we
paced
to
go
to
the
rail
and
view
the
horizon
with
the
air
of
a
man
perturbed
by
expectation
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
did
not
breathe
a
word
to
him
respecting
my
talk
with
the
carpenter
not
even
to
the
extent
of
saying
how
fancies
about
the
dutchman
were
flying
about
among
the
crew
for
this
subject
he
was
in
no
state
of
mind
to
be
brought
into
the
moon
was
rising
a
little
before
he
joined
me
and
we
stood
in
silence
watching
her
she
jutted
up
a
very
sickly
faint
red
that
brightened
but
a
little
after
she
lifted
her
lower
limb
clear
of
the
horizon
and
when
we
had
the
full
of
her
plain
we
perceived
her
strangely
distorted
by
the
atmosphere
of
the
shape
if
shape
it
can
be
called
of
a
rotten
orange
that
has
been
squeezed
or
of
a
turtle
egg
lightly
pressed
she
was
more
like
a
jelly
distilled
by
the
sky
ugly
and
even
affrighting
than
the
sweet
planet
that
empearls
the
world
at
night
and
whose
delicate
silver
the
lover
delights
to
behold
in
his
sweetheart
eyes
but
she
grew
more
shapely
as
she
soared
though
holding
a
dusky
blush
for
a
much
longer
time
than
ever
i
had
noticed
in
her
when
rising
off
the
main
and
her
wake
broken
by
the
small
black
curl
of
the
breeze
hung
in
broken
indissoluble
lumps
of
feverish
light
like
coagulated
gore
that
had
dropped
from
the
wound
she
looked
to
be
in
the
dark
sky
there
was
a
faintness
in
the
heavens
that
closed
out
the
sparkles
of
the
farther
stars
and
but
a
few
and
those
only
of
the
greatest
magnitude
were
visible
shining
in
several
colours
such
as
dim
pink
and
green
and
wan
crystal
all
which
together
with
one
or
two
of
them
above
our
mastheads
dimly
glittering
amidst
feeble
rings
made
the
whole
appearance
of
the
night
amazing
and
even
ghastly
enough
to
excite
a
feeling
of
awe
in
the
attention
it
compelled
the
captain
spoke
not
a
word
whilst
the
moon
slowly
floated
into
the
dusk
and
then
fetching
a
deep
breath
he
said
well
thank
god
if
she
do
grow
round
it
because
of
the
shadow
on
her
keep
a
bright
fenton
and
hold
the
ship
to
her
course
should
the
wind
fail
call
me
and
call
me
too
if
it
should
head
us
with
which
he
walked
quietly
to
the
hatch
stood
there
a
moment
or
two
with
his
hand
upon
it
and
his
face
looking
up
as
though
he
studied
the
trim
of
the
yards
and
then
disappeared
my
talk
with
the
carpenter
and
the
behaviour
of
the
captain
bred
in
me
a
sense
as
of
something
solemn
and
momentous
informing
the
hours
i
reasoned
with
myself
i
struggled
with
the
inexplicable
oppression
that
weighed
down
my
spirits
but
it
would
not
do
i
asked
myself
why
should
the
cheap
illiterate
fears
of
such
a
man
as
the
carpenter
affect
me
why
should
i
find
the
secret
of
my
soul
depression
in
the
superstitions
of
captain
skevington
whose
arguments
as
to
the
endevilment
of
the
dead
exhibited
a
decay
of
his
intellect
on
one
side
as
phthisis
consumes
one
lung
leaving
the
other
sound
enough
for
a
man
to
go
on
living
with
and
i
recited
these
comfortable
lines
of
the
poet
learn
though
mishap
may
cross
our
ways
it
is
not
ours
to
reckon
when
yet
in
vain
there
was
an
intelligence
of
my
spirits
that
was
not
to
be
soothed
and
i
found
myself
treading
about
the
deck
stepping
lightly
as
a
man
might
who
walks
upon
ground
under
which
the
dead
lie
whilst
i
felt
so
much
worried
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
my
heart
that
had
some
great
sorrow
just
befallen
me
i
could
not
have
been
sadder
as
the
night
wore
on
the
moon
gathered
her
wonted
hue
and
shape
though
her
refulgence
was
small
for
the
air
thickened
indeed
at
ten
all
the
lights
of
heaven
saving
the
moon
had
been
put
out
by
a
mist
the
texture
of
which
was
illustrated
by
the
only
luminary
the
sky
contained
around
whose
pale
expiring
disc
there
was
now
a
great
halo
with
something
of
the
character
of
a
lunar
rainbow
in
the
very
delicate
barely
determinable
tinctures
which
made
a
sort
of
shadowy
prism
of
it
more
like
what
one
would
dream
of
than
see
the
ocean
lay
very
black
there
was
no
power
in
the
moon
to
cast
a
wake
the
breathings
of
the
wind
rippled
the
water
and
caused
a
scintillation
of
the
spangles
of
the
phosphorus
or
the
weight
of
the
lower
sails
kept
them
hanging
up
and
down
and
what
motion
the
ship
had
was
from
the
swelling
of
the
light
canvas
that
rose
very
pale
and
ghostly
into
the
gloom
i
had
gone
to
the
taffrail
and
was
staring
there
away
into
the
dark
whither
our
short
wake
streamed
in
a
sort
of
smouldering
cloudiness
with
particles
of
fire
in
it
conceiving
that
the
wind
was
failing
and
waiting
to
make
sure
before
reporting
to
the
captain
when
i
was
startled
by
the
report
of
a
musket
or
some
small
arm
that
broke
upon
my
ear
with
a
muffled
sound
so
that
whence
it
came
i
could
not
conceive
yet
for
some
minutes
i
felt
so
persuaded
the
noise
had
been
seawards
that
spite
of
there
having
been
no
flash
i
stood
peering
hard
into
the
dark
first
one
side
then
the
other
far
as
the
sails
would
suffer
me
then
but
all
very
quickly
concluding
that
the
explosion
had
happened
aboard
and
might
betoken
mischief
i
ran
along
the
deck
where
close
against
the
wheel
i
found
a
number
of
seamen
talking
hurriedly
and
in
alarmed
voices
i
called
out
to
know
what
that
noise
had
been
none
knew
one
said
it
had
come
from
the
sea
another
that
there
had
been
a
small
explosion
in
the
hold
and
a
third
was
giving
his
opinion
when
at
that
instant
a
figure
darted
out
of
the
companion
hatch
clothed
in
his
shirt
and
drawers
and
cried
out
fenton
fenton
for
god
sake
where
are
you
i
recognized
the
voice
of
hall
and
bawled
back
here
sir
and
ran
to
him
he
grasped
my
arm
the
captain
has
shot
himself
he
exclaimed
where
is
he
said
i
in
his
cabin
he
answered
we
rushed
down
together
the
great
cabin
where
we
messed
was
in
darkness
but
a
light
shone
in
the
captain
berth
the
door
was
open
and
gently
swung
with
the
motion
of
the
ship
i
pushed
in
but
instantly
recoiled
with
horror
for
right
athwart
the
deck
lay
the
body
of
captain
skevington
with
the
top
of
his
head
blown
away
it
needed
but
one
glance
to
know
that
he
had
done
this
thing
with
his
own
hand
he
had
fired
the
piece
with
his
foot
by
a
string
attached
to
the
trigger
standing
upright
with
his
brow
bent
to
the
muzzle
for
the
bight
of
the
string
was
round
his
shoe
and
he
had
fallen
sideways
grasping
the
barrel
the
sight
froze
me
to
the
marrow
had
i
killed
him
by
accident
with
my
own
hand
i
could
not
have
trembled
more
but
this
exquisite
distress
was
it
was
only
needful
to
look
at
his
head
to
discover
how
fruitless
would
be
the
task
of
examining
him
for
any
signs
of
life
some
of
the
seamen
who
heard
hall
cry
out
to
me
about
this
thing
had
followed
us
below
forgetting
their
place
in
the
consternation
roused
in
them
and
stood
in
the
doorway
faintly
groaning
and
muttering
exclamations
of
pity
hall
bid
a
couple
of
them
raise
the
body
and
lay
it
in
its
bunk
and
cover
it
with
a
sheet
and
others
he
sent
for
water
and
a
swab
wherewith
to
cleanse
the
place
you
had
better
go
on
deck
again
fenton
says
he
to
me
the
ship
must
be
watched
i
join
you
presently
i
was
glad
to
withdraw
for
albeit
there
was
a
ghastliness
in
the
look
of
the
night
the
sea
being
black
as
ebony
though
touched
here
and
there
with
little
sheets
of
fire
and
stretching
like
a
pall
to
its
horizon
that
was
drawing
narrower
and
murkier
around
us
minute
after
minute
with
the
shadow
of
vapour
that
was
yet
too
thin
to
deserve
the
name
of
fog
though
there
was
this
ghastliness
i
say
aided
by
the
moon
that
was
now
little
more
than
a
dim
tarnished
blotch
of
shapeless
silver
wanly
ringed
with
an
ashen
cincture
yet
the
taste
of
the
faint
breeze
was
as
helpful
to
my
spirits
as
a
dram
of
generous
cordial
after
the
atmosphere
of
the
cabin
in
which
i
had
beheld
the
remains
of
captain
skevington
chapter
ix
hall
harangues
the
crew
the
news
had
spread
quickly
the
watch
below
had
roused
out
and
most
of
the
men
were
on
deck
and
they
moved
about
in
groups
striving
to
find
out
all
about
the
suicide
the
death
of
a
captain
of
a
ship
at
sea
is
sure
always
to
fill
the
crew
with
uneasiness
a
sense
of
uncertainty
is
excited
and
then
again
there
is
that
darkening
of
the
spirits
which
the
shadow
of
death
particularly
causes
among
a
slender
community
who
have
been
for
months
associated
as
a
family
and
amid
whom
every
man
face
speech
and
manner
are
maybe
more
familiar
than
his
own
brother
or
father
yet
of
all
the
souls
on
board
i
suspect
i
felt
the
most
sorely
for
owing
to
there
being
in
my
mind
much
more
that
was
akin
to
his
own
moods
than
he
could
find
in
hall
we
had
had
many
and
long
conversations
together
then
there
was
the
death
ship
for
me
to
recall
with
his
thoughts
on
it
and
his
conviction
that
evil
was
sure
to
follow
his
boarding
the
plymouth
snow
moreover
i
was
the
last
with
whom
he
had
exchanged
words
that
night
and
in
his
manner
of
quitting
me
after
looking
at
the
moon
there
was
positively
nothing
that
even
my
startled
and
imaginative
mind
could
witness
to
indicate
the
intention
that
had
destroyed
him
presently
hall
arrived
on
deck
fully
dressed
and
stepping
over
to
where
i
stood
in
deep
thought
exclaimed
did
you
have
a
suspicion
that
the
captain
designed
this
fearful
act
no
not
a
shadow
of
a
suspicion
i
answered
is
enough
to
make
one
believe
he
was
not
far
out
when
he
talked
of
the
he
expected
from
speaking
a
craft
that
had
sighted
vanderdecken
said
he
very
uneasily
which
made
me
see
how
strong
was
the
blow
his
nerves
had
received
and
running
his
eyes
restlessly
over
the
water
here
and
there
as
i
might
tell
by
the
dim
sparkle
the
faint
kindled
in
them
oh
but
he
continued
as
if
dashing
aside
his
fancies
the
mere
circumstance
of
his
being
so
superstitious
ought
to
explain
the
act
i
have
often
thought
there
was
a
vein
of
madness
in
him
i
never
questioned
that
i
replied
is
an
night
said
he
with
a
little
tremble
running
through
him
there
is
some
menace
of
foul
weather
we
shall
lose
this
faint
air
presently
he
shivered
again
and
said
such
a
sight
as
that
below
is
enough
to
make
a
hell
of
a
night
of
midsummer
beauty
it
is
the
suddenness
of
it
that
seizes
upon
the
imagination
why
d
know
fenton
i
give
a
handful
of
guineas
poor
as
i
am
for
a
rousing
gale
anything
to
blow
my
mind
to
its
bearings
for
here
a
sort
of
business
looking
aloft
that
fit
to
suffocate
the
heart
in
your
breast
such
words
in
so
plain
and
literal
a
man
made
me
perceive
how
violently
he
had
been
wrenched
i
begged
his
leave
to
go
below
and
fetch
him
a
glass
of
liquor
no
no
said
he
not
yet
anyhow
i
must
speak
to
those
fellows
there
saying
which
he
walked
a
little
distance
forward
calling
for
the
boatswain
on
that
officer
answering
he
said
are
all
hands
on
deck
i
believe
most
of
the
crew
are
on
deck
sir
replied
the
boatswain
pipe
all
hands
said
hall
the
clear
keen
whistling
rose
shrill
to
the
sails
and
made
as
blythe
a
sound
as
could
have
been
devised
for
the
cheering
of
us
up
the
men
gathered
quickly
some
lanthorns
were
fetched
and
in
the
light
of
them
stood
the
crew
near
to
the
a
strange
sight
it
was
the
shining
went
no
higher
than
up
the
mainsail
that
hung
steady
with
its
own
weight
and
as
much
of
it
as
was
thus
illuminated
showed
like
cloth
of
gold
pale
in
the
dusk
above
was
mere
shadow
the
like
a
drop
of
ink
upon
the
face
of
the
darkness
the
sails
of
so
weak
a
hue
they
seemed
as
though
in
the
act
of
dissolving
and
vanishing
away
the
crowd
of
faces
were
all
pale
and
their
eyes
full
of
gleaming
the
shadows
crawled
at
our
feet
and
with
the
total
concealment
of
the
moon
at
this
time
a
deeper
shade
fell
upon
the
sea
and
our
ship
and
the
delicate
rippling
of
the
water
alongside
seemed
to
stir
upon
our
ears
in
a
tinkling
as
from
out
of
the
middle
air
hall
made
a
brief
speech
he
explained
to
the
men
how
on
hearing
the
report
of
a
musket
he
had
sprung
from
his
bed
and
perceiving
leaking
through
the
openings
in
the
door
of
the
cabin
through
which
some
rays
of
light
streamed
he
entered
and
seeing
the
body
of
the
captain
and
the
horrid
condition
of
the
head
was
filled
with
a
panic
and
rushed
on
deck
that
the
master
had
shot
himself
was
certain
but
there
was
no
help
for
what
had
happened
the
command
of
the
ship
fell
upon
him
but
it
was
for
them
to
say
whether
he
should
navigate
the
ship
to
her
destination
or
carry
her
back
to
table
bay
where
a
fresh
commander
could
be
obtained
he
was
very
well
liked
on
board
being
an
excellent
seaman
and
the
crew
on
hearing
this
immediately
answered
that
they
wanted
no
better
master
to
sail
under
than
he
and
that
indeed
they
would
not
consent
to
a
change
but
having
said
this
with
a
heartiness
that
pleased
me
for
i
liked
hall
greatly
myself
and
was
extremely
glad
to
find
the
crew
so
well
disposed
they
fell
into
an
awkward
silence
broken
after
a
little
by
some
hoarse
whisperings
what
now
says
hall
why
sir
answers
the
boatswain
respectfully
it
this
with
the
men
there
a
notion
among
us
that
that
there
plymouth
snow
has
brought
to
the
ship
one
bad
specimen
of
which
has
just
happened
and
the
feeling
is
that
we
had
better
return
to
table
bay
so
as
to
get
the
influence
worked
out
of
the
old
barkey
how
is
that
to
be
done
says
hall
coming
easily
into
the
matter
partly
because
of
his
shaken
nerves
and
partly
because
of
the
kindness
he
felt
towards
the
hands
for
the
way
they
had
received
his
address
to
them
here
there
was
another
pause
and
then
the
boatswain
speaking
somewhat
shyly
said
the
carpenter
who
heard
tell
more
about
the
phantom
ship
and
the
spell
she
lays
on
vessels
than
all
hands
of
us
put
together
says
that
the
only
way
to
work
out
of
a
ship
timbers
the
that
been
put
into
them
by
what
magical
and
hellish
is
for
a
minister
of
religion
to
come
aboard
call
all
hands
to
prayer
and
ask
of
the
lord
a
blessing
on
the
ship
he
says
there
no
other
way
of
purifying
of
her
ca
we
pray
ourselves
for
a
blessing
says
hall
the
boatswain
not
quickly
answering
a
sailor
says
it
needs
a
man
who
knows
how
to
pray
who
acquainted
with
the
right
sort
of
words
to
use
aye
cried
another
and
whose
calling
is
religion
hall
as
if
he
would
address
me
then
checking
himself
he
said
well
my
lads
there
no
wind
now
and
small
promise
of
any
suppose
we
let
this
matter
rest
till
morning
fenton
and
i
will
talk
it
over
and
you
forward
can
turn
it
about
in
your
minds
i
believe
we
shall
be
easier
when
the
captain
buried
and
the
sun
up
and
then
we
might
agree
it
would
be
a
pity
to
put
back
after
the
tough
job
we
had
to
get
where
we
are
but
lest
you
should
still
be
all
of
one
mind
on
this
matter
in
the
morning
we
keep
the
ship
should
wind
come
under
small
sail
so
as
to
make
no
headway
worth
speaking
of
during
the
night
is
that
to
your
fancy
men
they
all
said
it
was
and
thereupon
went
forward
but
i
noticed
that
those
who
were
off
duty
did
not
offer
to
go
below
they
joined
the
watch
on
the
forecastle
and
i
could
hear
them
in
earnest
talk
their
voices
trembling
through
the
stillness
like
the
humming
of
a
congregation
in
church
following
the
parson
reading
hall
came
to
my
side
and
we
walked
the
deck
i
am
sorry
the
men
have
got
that
notion
of
this
ship
being
under
a
spell
said
he
this
is
no
sweet
time
of
the
year
in
these
seas
to
put
back
will
i
daresay
be
only
to
anger
the
weather
that
now
quiet
enough
and
there
always
the
risk
of
falling
into
dutch
hands
i
told
him
of
my
talk
with
the
carpenter
and
said
that
i
could
not
be
surprised
the
crew
were
alarmed
for
the
old
fellow
had
the
devil
own
knack
of
putting
his
fancies
in
an
alarming
way
i
laughed
at
some
of
his
fancies
said
i
but
i
do
mind
owning
that
i
quitted
his
cabin
so
dulled
in
my
spirits
by
his
talk
that
i
might
have
come
from
a
for
all
the
heart
there
was
in
me
well
things
must
take
their
chance
said
hall
i
speak
to
the
carpenter
myself
in
the
morning
and
afterwards
to
the
men
and
if
they
are
still
wishful
that
the
ship
should
return
to
table
bay
sail
her
there
is
all
one
to
me
i
liefer
have
a
new
captain
over
me
than
be
one
we
continued
until
five
bells
to
walk
to
and
fro
the
deck
talking
about
the
captain
suicide
the
strangeness
of
it
as
following
his
belief
that
had
come
to
the
ship
from
the
plymouth
vessel
with
other
such
matters
as
would
be
suggested
by
our
situation
and
the
tragedy
in
the
cabin
and
hall
then
said
he
would
go
below
for
a
glass
of
rum
but
he
refused
to
lie
down
though
i
offered
to
stand
an
hour
of
his
watch
that
is
from
midnight
till
one
for
he
said
he
should
not
be
able
to
sleep
most
of
the
crew
continued
to
hang
about
the
forecastle
which
rescued
the
deck
from
the
extreme
loneliness
i
had
found
in
it
ere
the
report
of
the
fatal
musket
startled
all
hands
into
wakefulness
and
movement
the
lanthorns
had
been
carried
away
and
the
ship
was
plunged
in
darkness
there
still
blew
a
very
light
air
so
gentle
that
you
needed
to
wet
your
finger
and
hold
it
up
to
feel
it
from
the
darkness
aloft
fell
the
delicate
sounds
of
the
higher
canvas
softly
drumming
the
masts
to
the
very
slight
rolling
of
the
ship
i
went
to
the
binnacle
and
found
that
the
vessel
was
heading
her
course
and
then
stepped
to
the
rail
upon
which
i
set
my
elbows
leaning
my
chin
in
my
hands
and
in
that
posture
fell
chapter
x
we
draw
close
to
a
strange
and
luminous
ship
now
i
might
have
stood
thus
for
ten
minutes
when
i
was
awakened
from
my
dream
by
an
eager
feverish
muttering
of
voices
forward
and
on
a
sudden
the
harsh
notes
of
a
seaman
belonging
to
my
watch
cried
out
d
see
that
sail
right
broad
sir
i
sprang
from
my
leaning
posture
and
peered
but
my
eyes
were
heavy
the
night
was
dark
and
whilst
i
stared
several
of
the
sailors
came
hurriedly
aft
to
where
i
stood
and
said
all
speaking
together
there
see
her
sir
look
yonder
mr
fenton
and
their
arms
to
a
man
shot
out
to
point
as
if
every
one
levelled
a
pistol
though
i
could
not
immediately
make
out
the
object
i
was
not
surprised
by
the
consternation
the
sailors
were
in
for
such
was
the
mood
and
temper
of
the
whole
company
that
not
the
most
familiar
and
prosaic
craft
that
floats
on
the
ocean
could
have
broken
through
the
obscurity
of
the
night
upon
their
gaze
without
tickling
their
superstitious
instincts
till
the
very
hair
of
their
heads
crawled
to
the
inward
motions
in
a
few
moments
sure
enough
i
made
out
the
loom
of
what
looked
a
large
ship
out
on
the
starboard
beam
as
well
as
i
could
distinguish
she
was
close
hauled
and
so
standing
as
to
pass
under
our
stern
she
made
a
sort
of
faintness
upon
the
sea
and
sky
where
she
was
nothing
more
and
even
to
be
sure
of
her
it
was
necessary
to
look
a
little
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
her
for
if
you
gazed
full
she
went
out
as
a
dim
distant
light
at
sea
does
thus
viewed
she
may
be
an
enemy
i
cried
there
should
be
no
lack
of
dutch
or
even
french
hereabouts
quick
lads
to
stations
send
the
boatswain
here
i
ran
to
the
companion
hatch
and
called
loudly
to
hall
he
had
fallen
asleep
on
a
locker
and
came
running
in
a
blind
sort
of
way
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
shouting
out
what
is
it
what
is
it
i
answered
that
there
was
a
large
ship
heading
directly
for
us
whereupon
he
was
instantly
wide
awake
and
sprang
up
the
ladder
crying
where
away
where
away
if
there
was
any
wind
i
could
feel
none
yet
some
kind
of
draught
there
must
have
been
for
the
ship
out
in
the
darkness
held
a
brave
luff
which
proved
her
under
command
we
on
the
other
hand
rested
upon
the
liquid
ebony
of
the
ocean
with
square
yards
the
mizzen
furled
the
starboard
clew
of
the
mainsail
hoisted
and
the
greater
number
of
our
staysails
down
whilst
hall
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
the
boatswain
arrived
for
orders
the
mate
turned
smartly
to
me
and
said
we
must
make
ready
and
take
our
chance
pipe
to
quarters
and
fenton
see
all
clear
for
the
second
time
in
my
watch
the
boatswain
pipe
shrilled
clear
to
the
canvas
from
whose
stretched
still
folds
the
sounds
broke
away
in
ghostly
echoes
we
were
not
a
had
no
drums
and
to
martial
duties
we
could
but
address
ourselves
clumsily
but
all
felt
that
there
might
be
a
great
danger
in
the
pale
shadow
yonder
that
had
seemed
to
ooze
out
upon
our
eyes
from
the
darkness
as
strangely
as
a
cloud
shapes
itself
upon
a
so
we
tumbled
about
quickly
and
wildly
enough
got
our
little
batteries
clear
put
on
the
and
tarpaulins
opened
the
magazine
lighted
the
matches
provided
the
guns
with
spare
breeches
and
tackles
and
stood
ready
for
whatever
was
to
come
all
this
we
contrived
with
the
aid
of
one
or
two
lanterns
very
secretly
moved
about
as
hall
did
not
wish
us
to
be
seen
making
ready
but
the
want
of
light
delayed
us
and
by
the
time
we
were
fully
prepared
the
strange
ship
had
insensibly
floated
down
to
about
upon
our
starboard
quarter
at
that
distance
it
was
too
black
to
enable
us
to
make
anything
of
her
but
we
comforted
ourselves
by
observing
that
she
did
not
offer
to
alter
her
course
whence
we
might
reasonably
hope
that
she
was
a
peaceful
trader
like
ourselves
she
showed
no
lights
her
sails
were
all
that
was
visible
of
her
owing
to
the
hue
they
put
into
the
darkness
over
her
hull
it
was
a
time
of
heavy
trial
to
our
patience
our
ship
had
come
to
a
dead
stand
as
it
was
easy
to
discover
by
looking
over
the
side
where
the
small
pale
puffs
of
phosphoric
radiance
that
flashed
under
water
at
the
depth
of
a
man
hand
from
our
vessel
strakes
whenever
she
rolled
no
matter
how
daintily
to
the
swell
hung
glimmering
for
a
space
in
the
selfsame
spot
where
they
were
discharged
nor
was
there
the
least
sound
of
water
in
motion
under
our
counter
unless
it
were
the
gurgling
drowning
sobbing
you
hear
there
on
a
still
night
when
the
stern
stoops
to
the
drop
of
the
fold
and
raises
that
strange
hollow
noise
of
washing
all
about
the
rudder
i
would
to
mercy
a
breeze
would
come
if
only
to
resolve
her
said
hall
to
me
in
a
low
voice
there
but
little
fun
to
be
got
out
of
this
sort
of
waiting
at
this
rate
we
must
keep
the
men
at
their
stations
till
daylight
to
find
out
what
she
is
pleasant
if
she
should
prove
some
lump
of
a
dutch
she
shows
uncommonly
large
do
you
think
fenton
so
do
we
to
her
i
dare
say
in
this
obscurity
i
replied
but
i
doubt
that
she
a
i
been
watching
her
closely
and
have
never
once
caught
sight
of
the
least
gleam
of
a
light
aboard
her
maybe
the
officer
of
the
watch
and
the
are
sound
asleep
said
he
with
a
slight
and
not
very
merry
laugh
and
if
she
steered
on
her
she
be
too
perhaps
for
the
helmsman
to
see
us
i
heard
him
say
this
without
closely
heeding
it
for
my
attention
at
that
moment
was
attracted
by
what
was
unquestionably
the
enlargement
of
her
pallid
shadow
sure
proof
that
she
had
shifted
her
helm
and
was
slowly
coming
round
so
as
to
head
for
us
hall
noticed
this
as
soon
as
i
ha
he
cried
they
mean
to
find
out
what
we
are
hey
observed
us
at
last
does
she
bring
an
air
with
her
that
she
under
control
or
is
it
that
she
lighter
and
taller
than
we
it
was
beyond
question
because
she
was
lighter
and
taller
and
having
been
kept
to
the
faint
draught
had
made
more
of
it
than
we
who
carried
it
aft
besides
we
were
loaded
down
to
our
bolts
with
cargo
and
the
water
and
other
stores
we
had
shipped
at
the
cape
yet
her
approach
was
so
sluggish
as
to
be
imperceptible
and
i
would
not
like
to
say
that
our
gradual
drawing
together
was
not
as
much
due
to
the
current
which
off
this
coast
runs
strong
to
the
westward
setting
us
who
were
deep
faster
towards
her
than
it
set
her
from
us
as
it
was
also
owing
to
the
strange
attraction
which
brings
becalmed
vessels
near
to
each
other
often
indeed
to
their
having
to
be
towed
clear
by
their
boats
meanwhile
the
utter
silence
on
board
the
stranger
the
blackness
in
which
her
hull
lay
hidden
the
strangeness
of
her
her
yards
to
head
up
for
us
without
any
signal
being
shown
that
she
designed
to
fight
us
wrought
such
a
fit
of
impatience
in
hall
that
he
swung
his
body
from
the
backstay
he
clutched
in
movements
positively
convulsive
are
they
all
dead
aboard
on
such
a
night
as
this
one
should
be
able
to
hear
the
least
sound
the
hauling
taut
of
a
tackle
the
rasping
of
the
she
surely
does
hope
to
catch
us
napping
said
i
god
knows
cried
the
mate
what
would
i
give
now
for
a
bit
of
moon
if
it
to
be
a
fight
it
have
to
be
a
shooting
match
for
a
spell
or
wind
must
come
quickly
said
i
but
if
she
meant
mischief
she
head
to
pass
under
our
stern
where
she
could
rake
us
rather
than
steer
to
come
broadside
on
instead
of
responding
the
mate
sprang
on
to
the
and
in
tones
such
as
only
the
practised
and
powerful
lungs
of
a
seaman
can
fling
roared
out
ho
the
ship
ahoy
we
listened
with
so
fierce
a
strain
of
attention
that
the
very
beating
of
our
hearts
rung
in
our
ears
but
not
a
sound
came
across
the
water
twice
yet
did
hall
hail
that
pallid
fabric
shapeless
as
yet
in
the
dark
air
but
to
no
purpose
on
this
there
was
much
whispering
among
the
men
clustered
about
the
guns
their
voices
came
along
in
a
low
grumbling
sound
like
the
growling
of
dogs
dulled
by
threats
silence
fore
and
aft
cried
the
mate
we
do
know
what
she
is
but
we
know
what
we
are
and
as
englishmen
we
surely
have
spirit
enough
for
whatever
may
come
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
after
these
few
words
then
the
muttering
broke
out
afresh
but
scattered
a
group
talking
to
larboard
another
on
the
forecastle
and
so
forth
meanwhile
the
vessels
all
insensibly
had
continued
to
draw
closer
and
closer
to
each
other
a
small
clarification
of
the
atmosphere
happening
past
the
stranger
suffered
a
dim
disclosure
of
her
canvas
whence
i
perceived
that
she
had
nothing
set
above
her
though
it
was
impossible
to
see
whether
she
carried
or
indeed
whether
the
yards
belonging
to
those
masts
were
crossed
on
them
her
hull
had
now
also
stolen
out
into
a
shadow
and
after
gazing
at
it
with
painful
intentness
for
some
moments
i
was
extravagantly
astonished
to
observe
a
kind
of
crawling
and
flickering
of
light
resembling
that
which
burnt
in
the
sea
stirring
like
along
the
vessel
side
i
was
about
to
direct
hall
attention
to
this
thing
when
he
said
in
a
subdued
voice
fenton
d
notice
the
faint
shining
about
her
hull
what
in
god
name
can
it
be
he
had
scarce
uttered
these
words
when
a
sailor
on
the
starboard
side
of
our
ship
whom
i
recognised
by
the
voice
as
one
ephraim
jacobs
an
elderly
sober
seaman
cried
out
with
a
sort
of
scream
in
his
notes
as
i
hope
to
be
forgiven
my
sins
for
jesu
sake
yon
the
ship
that
was
curst
last
century
chapter
xi
a
cruel
disaster
befalls
me
the
mere
putting
into
words
the
suspicion
that
had
been
troubling
all
our
minds
made
one
man
in
action
of
the
whole
crew
like
the
firing
of
forty
pieces
of
ordnance
in
the
same
instant
whatever
the
sailors
held
they
flung
down
and
in
a
bound
came
to
the
waist
on
the
starboard
side
where
they
stood
looking
at
the
ship
and
making
amid
that
silence
the
strangest
noise
that
ever
was
heard
with
their
deep
and
fearful
breathing
great
thunder
broke
in
one
of
them
presently
d
know
what
that
shining
is
mates
why
it
the
glow
of
timbers
that
been
rotted
by
near
two
hundred
years
of
weather
softly
tom
said

is
hell
that
owns
her

they
have
the
malice
of
devils
and
they

but
touch
us
to
founder
us
wait
and
you
shall
see
her
melt
exclaimed
one
of
the
two
foreigners
who
were
among
our
company
of
seamen
if
she
is
as
i
believe
she
will
be
manned
by
the
ghosts
of
wicked
men
who
have
perished
at
sea
presently
a
bell
shall
strike
and
she
must
disappear
as
this
was
said
there
was
a
commotion
forward
and
the
carpenter
borne
by
two
stout
hands
was
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
crew
and
propped
up
so
that
he
might
see
the
ship
i
was
as
eager
as
any
of
the
most
illiterate
sailors
on
board
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
and
took
a
step
the
better
to
catch
his
words
a
whole
minute
went
by
whilst
he
gazed
so
strained
and
anticipative
were
my
senses
that
the
moments
seemed
as
hours
he
then
said
mates
yonder
the
death
ship
right
enough
look
hard
and
you
mark
the
steeve
of
her
bowsprit
with
the
round
top
at
the
end
of
it
and
the
spring
of
her
aft
in
a
fashion
more
ancient
than
is
the
ages
of
any
two
of
the
oldest
men
aboard
note
the
of
her
and
how
the
heel
of
the
foremast
looks
to
step
in
the
that
the
ship
born
in
vanderdecken
master
what
i
often
heard
tell
of
raise
my
head
mates
and
here
whether
through
pain
or
weakness
or
horror
he
fainted
but
being
laid
upon
the
deck
and
some
water
thrown
over
his
face
he
came
to
in
a
short
while
and
lay
trembling
refusing
to
speak
or
answer
questions
a
slight
thinning
of
the
vapour
that
hid
the
moon
had
enabled
us
to
remark
those
points
in
the
ship
the
carpenter
had
named
and
whilst
he
was
being
recovered
from
his
swoon
the
moon
looked
down
from
a
gulf
in
the
mist
but
her
light
was
still
very
tarnished
and
dim
though
blurred
and
distorted
as
was
her
appearance
yet
there
instantly
formed
round
her
the
same
halo
or
wan
circle
that
was
visible
before
she
was
hidden
but
her
apparition
made
a
light
that
exquisitely
answered
to
those
two
lines
of
shakespeare
therefore
the
moon
the
governess
of
floods
pale
in
her
anger
washes
all
the
air
for
such
radiance
as
fell
really
seemed
like
a
cleansing
of
the
atmosphere
after
the
black
smother
that
had
encompassed
us
and
now
we
could
all
see
the
ship
distinctly
as
she
lay
on
our
quarter
with
her
broadside
somewhat
to
us
her
yards
trimmed
like
our
own
and
her
sails
hanging
dead
it
was
the
solemnest
sight
that
ever
mortal
eye
beheld
the
light
left
her
black
so
there
was
no
telling
what
hue
she
showed
or
was
painted
her
bows
lay
low
in
the
water
after
the
old
fashion
with
curling
to
her
beak
that
doubtless
bore
an
ornament
though
we
could
not
distinguish
it
there
she
rose
like
a
hill
broken
with
the
bulwarks
that
defined
her
waist
and
short
poop
this
was
as
much
as
we
could
discern
of
her
hull
her
foremast
stood
close
to
where
the
heel
of
her
bowsprit
came
her
raked
over
her
stern
and
upon
it
was
a
yard
answering
to
the
rig
of
a
felucca
the
clew
of
its
sail
came
down
clear
of
a
huge
lantern
whose
iron
frame
for
all
the
glass
in
it
was
broke
and
gone
showed
like
the
skeleton
of
some
monster
on
her
taffrail
it
was
a
sight
to
terrify
the
stoutest
heart
to
see
the
creeping
of
thin
worm
or
gleamings
upon
the
side
she
showed
to
us
i
considered
at
first
she
was
glossy
and
that
those
lights
were
the
reflection
of
the
phosphoric
fires
in
the
water
under
her
but
it
was
soon
made
plain
that
this
was
not
so
as
though
to
be
sure
a
greenish
glare
of
the
true
would
show
against
or
near
her
when
she
slightly
leaned
as
we
did
to
the
swell
this
or
glimmer
played
all
along
her
without
regard
to
the
phosphorescence
under
her
now
ever
since
i
was
first
going
to
sea
i
had
as
i
have
said
believed
in
the
existence
of
the
spectre
ship
which
all
mariners
i
have
sailed
with
feared
to
encounter
but
so
many
imaginative
stories
had
come
of
her
some
feigning
as
the
carpenter
version
showed
that
she
was
a
death
ship
filled
with
spectres
who
navigated
her
others
that
she
was
a
spectral
bark
laden
with
souls
against
whom
the
gates
of
purgatory
were
closed
others
that
she
was
a
vessel
for
ever
beating
against
gales
of
wind
sometimes
appearing
in
a
tempest
that
surrounded
her
when
the
rest
of
the
ocean
was
smooth
sometimes
rising
from
the
waves
sometimes
floating
among
the
clouds
buffetting
up
there
as
though
the
masses
of
insubstantial
vapour
were
solid
and
massy
folds
and
acclivities
i
say
i
had
heard
so
many
stories
that
they
had
ended
in
leaving
me
with
a
belief
of
my
own
which
was
that
the
phantom
ship
rightly
so
named
was
an
airy
incorporeal
thing
a
vision
to
be
encountered
but
rarely
in
these
parts
a
that
had
been
too
often
beheld
in
the
course
of
years
to
be
denied
and
as
truly
a
spectre
in
its
way
as
any
that
may
be
read
of
in
holy
writ
or
that
has
stood
at
the
bedsides
of
men
and
women
and
delivered
messages
from
futurity
this
being
my
belief
then
though
i
was
mightily
terrified
by
the
ancient
shape
of
the
ship
and
the
mystery
of
her
purpose
and
the
darkness
and
silence
that
clothed
her
i
could
not
believe
that
she
was
the
true
spectre
that
the
sailor
dreads
for
that
she
was
as
substantial
as
our
vessel
a
quarry
of
stout
spurs
and
knotted
fangs
was
undeniable
not
more
from
her
quiet
heaving
motion
than
from
the
dull
sounds
i
had
now
and
again
caught
of
the
movement
of
her
gear
aloft
such
as
the
scraping
of
a
rope
in
a
block
or
the
soft
slap
of
a
cloth
against
a
spar
by
the
heave
of
the
fabric
setting
some
light
sail
what
think
you
of
her
fenton
said
hall
speaking
softly
but
with
much
of
his
excitement
and
uneasiness
gone
does
she
resemble
the
craft
that
the
master
of
the
snow
told
captain
skevington
he
sighted
hereabouts
why
yes
i
think
so
said
i
but
it
does
not
follow
that
she
is
the
phantom
ship
the
plymouth
hooker
yarn
owed
a
good
deal
to
terror
and
it
would
not
lose
in
its
passage
through
the
brain
of
a
lunatic
as
i
fear
poor
skevington
was
she
has
a
very
solid
look
she
is
a
real
ship
but
the
like
of
her
i
have
never
seen
save
in
old
prints
mark
those
faint
fiery
stripes
and
spirals
upon
her
i
do
not
understand
it
the
wood
that
yields
such
light
must
be
as
rotten
as
tinder
and
porous
as
a
sponge
it
could
not
swim
by
this
time
the
mysterious
ship
had
floated
out
her
whole
length
unless
it
were
our
vessel
that
had
slewed
and
given
us
that
view
of
her
no
light
save
the
lambent
gleams
on
her
sides
was
to
be
seen
we
could
hear
no
voices
we
could
discern
no
movement
of
figures
or
distinguish
any
outline
resembling
a
human
shape
upon
her
on
a
sudden
my
eye
was
caught
by
an
illumination
overhead
that
made
a
lustre
strong
enough
to
enable
me
to
see
the
face
of
hall
i
looked
up
conceiving
that
one
of
our
crew
had
jumped
aloft
with
a
lantern
and
saw
at
our
main
a
or
elmo
light
that
shone
freely
like
a
luminous
bulb
poised
a
few
inches
above
the
spar
scarce
had
this
been
kindled
and
whilst
it
was
paling
the
faces
of
our
seamen
who
stared
at
it
there
suddenly
shone
two
bright
meteors
of
a
similar
kind
upon
the
strange
ship
one
on
top
of
the
that
was
the
full
height
of
the
main
spars
and
one
on
the
summit
of
a
mast
that
stood
up
from
the
round
top
at
the
end
of
the
bowsprit
and
that
in
olden
times
before
it
was
discontinued
would
have
been
called
the
they
had
something
of
the
glory
of
stars
their
reflection
twisted
like
silver
serpents
in
the
dark
waters
and
as
though
they
had
been
flambeaux
or
lamps
they
flung
their
spectral
glow
upon
the
sails
of
the
vessel
upon
her
rigging
and
spars
sickling
all
things
to
their
starry
colour
dimly
illuminating
even
the
distant
poop
showing
clearly
the
dark
line
of
bulwarks
whilst
a
deeper
dye
of
blackness
entered
into
the
hull
from
the
shadow
between
the
on
high
and
their
mirroring
beneath
thanks
be
to
god
for
the
sight
of
those
lights
exclaimed
a
deep
voice
sounding
out
among
the
men
it
a
saint
hand
as
kindles
them
i
heared
and
there
be
a
breeze
with
luck
behind
it
presently
see
mr
hall
cried
i
pointing
do
you
observe
the
figures
of
men
look
along
the
line
of
the
forecastle
one
two
three
i
count
six
there
and
look
right
aft
on
that
bit
of
a
poop
do
you
mark
a
couple
of
shapes
viewing
us
as
if
with
folded
arms
yes
he
paused
staring
then
added
those
lights
are
familiar
enough
to
me
i
seen
them
scores
of
times
speaking
in
whispers
which
trembled
back
to
their
former
notes
of
consternation
but
there
something
frightful
about
them
now
and
yonder
one
pointing
to
our
and
the
sight
they
show
she
no
natural
ship
he
said
pulling
off
his
cap
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
would
to
god
a
breeze
would
come
and
part
us
hail
him
again
sir
hail
him
you
my
throat
is
dry
i
walked
right
aft
to
bring
me
more
abreast
of
the
silent
motionless
figures
on
the
stranger
poop
and
jumping
on
to
the
rail
caught
hold
of
the
vang
of
the
to
steady
myself
and
putting
a
hand
to
my
mouth
roared
out
ship
ahoy
what
ship
is
that
and
stopped
breathless
so
that
i
seemed
to
hear
the
echoes
of
my
own
voice
among
the
sails
of
the
stranger
what
ship
is
that
now
came
back
in
a
deep
note
and
the
two
figures
separated
one
walking
forward
and
the
other
stepping
as
i
had
on
to
the
bulwark
over
the
the
saracen
of
london
bound
to
indian
ports
i
responded
i
will
send
a
boat
cried
the
man
in
the
same
voice
if
you
do
we
fire
into
it
screamed
a
seaman
on
our
deck
mates
hall
you
see
now
what
he
is
keep
them
off
keep
them
off
at
which
there
was
a
sudden
hurrying
of
feet
with
many
clicking
sounds
of
triggers
sharply
cocked
by
which
i
knew
our
men
had
armed
themselves
the
at
our
vanished
in
a
few
seconds
it
showed
itself
afresh
midway
up
the
mainmast
making
a
wild
light
all
around
it
those
on
the
stranger
burned
steadily
and
i
believed
a
third
had
been
kindled
on
her
till
i
saw
it
was
a
lantern
carried
along
the
deck
there
was
a
stillness
lasting
some
minutes
what
they
were
about
we
could
not
see
anon
came
a
creaking
as
of
ropes
travelling
in
blocks
then
a
light
splash
the
lantern
dropped
jerkily
down
the
ship
side
plainly
grasped
by
a
man
flashes
of
phosphorus
broke
out
of
the
water
to
the
dip
of
oars
like
fire
clipped
from
a
flint
i
felt
a
faint
air
blowing
but
did
not
heed
it
being
with
the
excitement
and
fear
raised
in
me
by
what
i
could
now
see
thanks
to
the
light
of
the
elmo
fires
and
the
mystic
crawlings
of
flames
on
the
sides
i
saw
a
boat
square
at
both
ends
with
the
gunwale
running
out
into
horns
rowed
by
two
figures
whilst
a
third
stood
upright
in
the
bows
holding
high
a
lighted
lantern
in
one
hand
and
extending
his
other
arm
in
a
posture
of
supplication
at
this
instant
a
yellow
glare
broke
in
a
dazzle
from
our
own
ship
rail
and
the
thunder
of
twenty
muskets
fired
at
once
fell
upon
my
hearing
i
started
with
the
violence
of
the
shock
breaking
in
upon
me
heedlessly
let
go
the
vang
that
i
had
been
grasping
with
my
left
hand
and
fell
headlong
overboard
chapter
xii
i
am
rescued
by
the
death
ship
i
rose
to
the
surface
from
a
deep
plunge
but
being
a
very
indifferent
swimmer
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
clothed
as
i
was
to
keep
myself
afloat
by
battling
with
my
hands
i
heard
the
rippling
of
the
water
about
my
ears
and
i
felt
a
deep
despair
settle
upon
my
spirits
for
i
knew
that
the
air
that
blew
would
carry
my
ship
away
from
me
and
that
i
must
speedily
drown
indeed
to
the
first
impulse
of
wind
the
saracen
had
moved
and
i
could
see
her
a
great
shadow
drawing
away
with
the
that
a
minute
before
had
sparkled
on
her
mainmast
now
shining
on
her
i
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
in
the
noise
of
the
shooting
and
amid
the
general
alarm
excited
by
the
approach
of
the
boat
neither
the
splash
i
had
made
in
striking
the
water
nor
my
disappearance
had
been
noticed
and
i
remember
thinking
with
the
swiftness
peculiar
to
persons
in
my
situation
for
as
cowper
says
he
long
survives
who
lives
an
hour
in
ocean
i
say
i
remember
thinking
that
even
if
i
should
be
immediately
missed
it
was
most
unlikely
the
crew
would
suffer
hall
to
stop
the
ship
and
seek
for
me
for
they
would
be
mad
not
to
use
the
new
wind
and
sweep
away
from
waters
accurst
by
the
presence
of
what
was
undoubtedly
the
death
ship
whilst
if
even
hall
persuasion
should
prevail
yet
long
before
that
time
i
should
have
sunk
i
struggled
hard
to
keep
myself
afloat
freely
breaking
the
water
in
the
hope
that
the
light
and
whiteness
of
it
might
be
seen
four
or
five
minutes
thus
passed
and
i
was
feeling
my
legs
growing
weighty
as
lead
when
i
noticed
a
light
approach
me
my
eyes
being
full
of
wet
i
could
see
no
more
than
the
light
what
held
or
bore
it
being
eclipsed
by
the
spikes
or
fibres
that
shot
out
of
it
as
you
notice
a
candle
flame
when
the
sight
is
damp
i
could
also
hear
the
dip
and
trickle
of
oars
and
tried
to
shout
but
my
brain
was
giddy
my
mind
sinking
into
a
babbling
state
and
in
truth
i
was
so
exhausted
that
but
for
the
sudden
life
darted
into
me
by
the
sight
of
the
lamp
i
am
sure
i
should
then
and
there
have
clenched
my
hands
above
my
head
and
sunk
the
lantern
was
flashed
full
upon
my
face
and
i
was
grasped
by
my
hair
he
who
seized
me
spoke
and
i
believed
it
was
the
voice
of
one
of
the
men
in
my
watch
though
i
did
not
catch
a
syllable
of
his
speech
after
which
i
felt
myself
grasped
under
each
arm
and
lifted
out
of
the
water
whereupon
i
no
doubt
fainted
for
there
is
a
blank
between
this
and
what
followed
though
the
interval
must
have
been
very
short
when
i
opened
my
eyes
or
rather
when
my
senses
returned
to
me
i
found
myself
lying
on
my
back
and
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
moon
shining
weakly
amid
thin
bodies
of
vapour
which
the
wind
had
set
in
motion
and
which
sped
under
her
in
puffs
like
the
smoke
of
gunpowder
after
the
discharge
of
a
cannon
i
lay
musing
a
little
while
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
moon
and
some
dark
stretches
of
sail
hovering
above
me
but
my
mind
gathering
force
i
saw
by
the
cut
of
the
canvas
that
i
was
on
board
a
strange
ship
and
then
did
i
observe
three
men
standing
near
my
feet
watching
me
a
great
terror
seized
my
heart
i
sprang
erect
with
a
loud
cry
of
fear
and
rushed
to
the
rail
to
see
if
the
saracen
was
near
that
i
might
hail
her
but
was
stayed
in
that
by
being
seized
by
the
arm
he
who
clutched
me
exclaimed
in
dutch
what
would
you
do
if
you
could
swim
for
a
week
you
would
not
catch
her
i
perfectly
understood
him
but
made
no
reply
did
not
even
look
at
him
staring
about
the
sea
for
the
saracen
in
an
anguish
of
mind
not
to
be
expressed
suddenly
i
caught
sight
of
the
smudge
of
her
and
perceived
she
was
heading
away
on
her
course
she
was
out
on
our
starboard
beam
i
cast
my
eyes
aloft
and
found
the
yards
of
the
ship
i
was
in
braced
up
to
meet
the
wind
on
the
larboard
tack
whence
i
knew
that
every
instant
was
widening
the
space
between
the
two
vessels
on
mastering
this
i
could
have
dashed
myself
down
on
the
deck
with
grief
and
terror
one
of
the
group
observing
me
as
if
i
should
fall
extended
his
hand
but
i
shrunk
back
with
horror
and
covered
my
face
whilst
deep
hysteric
sobs
burst
from
my
breast
for
now
without
heeding
any
further
appearances
i
knew
that
i
was
on
board
the
phantom
ship
the
sea
spectre
dreaded
of
marines
a
fabric
accurst
by
god
in
the
presence
of
men
dead
and
yet
alive
more
terrible
in
their
supernatural
existence
in
their
clothing
of
flesh
whose
human
mortality
had
been
rendered
undecaying
by
a
fate
that
shrunk
up
the
soul
in
one
to
think
of
than
had
they
been
ghosts
essences
through
which
you
might
pass
your
hand
as
through
a
moonbeam
i
stood
awhile
as
though
paralysed
but
was
presently
rallied
by
the
chill
of
the
night
wind
striking
through
my
streaming
clothes
a
lantern
was
near
where
the
three
men
were
grouped
no
doubt
the
same
that
had
been
carried
in
the
boat
but
the
dim
illumination
would
have
sufficed
for
no
more
than
to
throw
out
the
proportion
of
things
within
its
sphere
had
it
not
been
helped
by
the
faint
moonlight
and
a
that
shone
with
the
power
of
a
planet
close
against
the
blocks
of
the
jeers
of
the
mainyard
was
a
ghostly
radiance
to
behold
the
men
in
but
i
found
nerve
now
to
survey
them
there
were
three
as
i
have
said
one
very
tall
above
six
feet
with
a
grey
almost
white
beard
that
descended
to
his
waist
the
second
was
a
broad
corpulent
man
of
the
true
dutch
build
without
hair
on
his
face
in
the
third
man
i
could
see
nothing
striking
if
it
were
not
for
a
ruggedness
of
seafaring
aspect
i
could
not
distinguish
their
apparel
beyond
that
the
stout
man
wore
boots
to
the
height
of
his
knees
whereas
the
tall
personage
was
clad
in
black
hose
shoes
with
large
buckles
and
breeches
terminating
at
the
knees
their
were
alike
a
sort
of
cap
of
skin
with
flaps
for
the
ears
do
you
speak
dutch
said
the
tallest
of
the
three
after
eyeing
me
in
silence
whilst
a
man
could
have
counted
a
hundred
he
it
was
who
had
responded
to
my
hail
from
the
saracen
as
my
ear
immediately
detected
now
that
i
had
my
faculties
by
the
deep
melodiousness
and
tremor
of
his
voice
i
answered
yes
why
were
your
people
afraid
of
us
we
intended
no
harm
we
desired
but
a
little
favour
a
small
quantity
of
tobacco
of
which
we
are
short
this
speech
i
followed
though
some
of
the
words
or
the
pronunciation
of
them
were
different
from
what
i
had
been
used
to
hear
at
rotterdam
he
spoke
imperiously
with
a
hint
even
of
passion
and
rearing
himself
to
his
full
stature
clasped
his
hands
behind
him
and
stared
at
me
as
some
indian
king
might
at
a
slave
sir
said
i
speaking
brokenly
for
i
was
a
slow
hand
at
his
tongue
and
besides
the
chill
of
my
clothes
was
now
become
a
pain
first
let
me
ask
what
ship
is
this
and
who
are
you
and
your
men
who
have
rescued
me
from
death
the
name
of
this
ship
is
the
braave
he
answered
in
his
deep
solemn
voice
i
who
command
the
vessel
am
known
as
cornelius
vanderdecken
the
three
seamen
to
whom
you
owe
your
life
are
frederick
houtman
john
de
bremen
and
this
man
indicating
the
rough
uncouth
person
who
stood
on
his
left
the
mate
herman
van
vogelaar
i
felt
a
sensation
as
of
ice
pressed
to
my
chest
when
he
pronounced
his
own
name
yet
recollecting
he
had
called
his
ship
the
braave
i
asked
though
was
wonderful
he
could
follow
my
utterance
what
port
do
you
belong
to
amsterdam
where
are
you
from
batavia
i
said
when
did
you
sail
on
the
of
july
in
last
year
by
the
glory
of
the
holy
trinity
but
it
is
dreary
work
see
how
the
wind
heads
us
even
yet
he
sighed
deeply
and
glanced
aloft
in
a
manner
that
suggested
grievous
weariness
last
year
i
thought
a
sudden
elation
expanding
my
soul
and
calming
me
as
an
opiate
might
if
that
be
so
why
then
though
this
ship
had
made
a
prodigiously
long
voyage
of
it
from
java
to
these
parallels
there
is
nothing
wildly
out
of
nature
in
such
tardiness
last
year
had
i
caught
the
true
signification
of
the
words
he
used
pray
sir
said
i
speaking
in
as
firm
a
voice
as
the
shivers
which
chased
me
permitted
what
might
last
year
be
the
mate
van
vogelaar
growled
out
some
exclamation
i
could
not
catch
the
captain
made
a
gesture
with
his
hands
whilst
their
burly
companion
said
in
thick
dutch
accents
it
needs
not
salt
water
but
good
strong
liquor
to
take
away
a
hollander
brain
last
year
exclaimed
vanderdecken
unbending
his
haughty
imperious
manner
why
mynheer
what
should
be
last
year
but
chapter
xiii
wy
zyn
al
verdomd
when
he
said
this
i
felt
like
one
in
whom
there
is
suddenly
wrought
a
dual
action
of
the
brain
where
from
one
side
so
to
say
there
is
darted
into
the
mind
thoughts
utterly
illogical
and
insane
which
the
same
side
marvels
at
and
seeks
to
reject
though
if
the
fit
linger
the
whole
intelligence
may
be
seized
i
recollect
of
seeking
for
confirmation
of
the
words
of
the
man
who
styled
himself
vanderdecken
in
the
ship
and
of
noticing
for
the
first
time
that
upon
the
planks
of
the
deck
which
were
out
of
the
reach
of
the
were
the
same
crawling
elusive
fires
as
of
phosphorus
creeping
and
coming
and
going
upon
a
dark
wall
which
i
had
observed
on
the
vessel
sides
several
figures
of
men
moved
forward
close
beside
me
was
a
small
gun
of
the
kind
carried
by
ships
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
termed
a
light
saker
and
discharging
a
ball
there
were
three
of
these
on
the
larboard
side
and
in
the
haze
of
the
moonlight
and
the
sheen
of
the
star
that
shone
with
a
pure
pale
gold
over
my
head
i
could
discern
upon
the
bulwarks
of
the
and
poop
several
swivels
furnished
with
handles
for
pointing
them
i
also
observed
a
short
flight
of
steps
conducting
to
the
with
two
sets
of
a
like
kind
leading
to
the
poop
the
front
of
which
was
furnished
with
a
door
and
little
window
these
matters
i
took
in
with
a
sweep
of
the
eye
for
the
light
was
confusing
a
faint
erroneous
ray
glancing
from
imperfect
surfaces
and
flinging
half
an
image
and
then
an
indescribable
fear
possessing
me
again
i
looked
in
the
direction
where
i
had
last
beheld
the
smudge
made
by
the
saracen
and
not
seeing
her
cried
out
wildly
in
my
broken
dutch
sirs
for
the
love
of
god
follow
my
ship
and
make
some
signals
that
she
may
know
i
am
here
skipper
exclaimed
the
corpulent
man
who
proved
to
be
the
boatswain
named
antony
jans
after
their
cowardly
inhumanity
in
firing
upon
a
small
unarmed
boat
and
putting
in
peril
the
life
of
our
mate
van
vogelaar
we
should
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
henceforth
this
englishman
will
know
that
the
dutch
are
a
merciful
people
said
van
vogelaar
scornfully
had
our
nationalities
been
reversed
he
would
have
been
left
to
drown
as
a
tribute
to
the
courage
of
his
comrades
whilst
this
was
said
vanderdecken
continued
to
regard
me
steadfastly
and
with
great
sternness
then
on
a
sudden
relaxing
his
frown
he
exclaimed
in
that
wondrous
voice
of
his
which
put
a
solemn
music
into
his
least
utterance
come
you
shiver
with
the
cold
and
have
the
look
of
the
drowned
jans
send
prins
to
me
sir
please
to
follow
he
motioned
in
a
haughty
manner
towards
the
poop
and
walked
that
way
one
desperate
look
i
cast
round
the
sea
and
then
with
a
prayer
to
god
that
this
experience
might
prove
some
eclipse
of
my
reason
from
which
my
mind
would
float
out
bright
afresh
ere
long
i
followed
the
great
figure
of
the
captain
but
with
a
step
so
faltering
from
weakness
and
grief
that
he
perceiving
my
condition
took
me
by
the
elbow
and
supported
me
up
the
ladder
to
the
cabin
under
the
poop
whether
it
was
this
courtesy
or
owing
to
a
return
of
my
manhood
and
i
trust
the
reader
will
approve
the
candour
with
which
i
have
confessed
my
cowardice
whatever
might
be
the
reason
i
began
now
to
look
about
me
with
a
growing
curiosity
the
interior
into
which
captain
vanderdecken
conducted
me
was
of
a
dingy
yellowish
hue
such
as
age
might
complexion
delicate
white
paint
with
an
oil
lamp
of
a
very
beautiful
elegant
and
rare
pattern
furnished
with
eight
panes
of
glass
variously
and
all
choicely
coloured
with
figures
of
birds
flowers
and
the
like
though
the
opening
at
the
bottom
let
the
white
light
of
the
fall
fair
on
to
the
table
and
the
deck
swung
by
a
thin
chain
from
a
central
beam
the
cabin
was
the
width
of
the
ship
and
on
its
walls
were
oval
frames
dusky
as
old
mahogany
each
one
as
i
suspected
holding
a
painting
over
the
door
by
which
the
cabin
was
entered
was
a
clock
and
near
it
hung
a
cage
with
a
parrot
in
it
of
ports
i
could
see
no
remains
and
supposed
that
by
day
all
the
light
that
entered
streamed
through
the
windows
on
either
side
the
door
the
deck
was
dark
as
with
age
at
the
after
end
there
were
two
state
cabins
bulkheaded
off
from
the
living
room
each
with
a
door
the
several
colours
of
the
lamp
caused
it
to
cast
a
radiance
like
a
rainbow
and
therefore
it
was
hard
to
make
sure
of
objects
amid
such
an
intricacy
of
illumination
but
as
i
have
said
the
sides
of
the
cabin
were
a
sickly
dismal
yellow
and
the
furniture
in
it
was
formed
of
a
very
solid
square
table
with
legs
marvellously
carved
and
a
box
beneath
it
two
benches
on
either
hand
and
a
black
chair
the
back
of
withered
velvet
the
wood
framing
it
cut
into
many
devices
at
the
head
or
sternmost
end
of
it
all
these
things
were
matters
to
be
quickly
noticed
the
captain
first
removing
his
cap
pointed
to
a
bench
and
lifting
his
finger
with
a
glance
at
the
starboard
cabin
said
in
a
low
tone
sir
if
you
speak
be
it
softly
if
you
please
and
then
directed
his
eyes
towards
the
entrance
from
the
deck
standing
erect
with
one
hand
on
the
table
and
manifestly
waiting
for
the
person
he
had
styled
prins
to
arrive
a
lustre
was
upon
his
face
his
waist
down
was
in
the
white
lamplight
he
had
a
most
noble
port
i
thought
such
an
elevation
of
the
head
such
disdainful
and
determined
erectness
of
figure
as
made
his
posture
royal
there
was
not
the
least
hint
in
his
face
of
the
dutch
flatness
and
insipidity
of
expression
one
is
used
to
in
those
industrious
but
phlegmatic
people
his
nose
was
aquiline
the
nostrils
hidden
by
the
moustachios
which
mingled
with
his
noble
druidical
beard
his
forehead
was
square
and
heavy
his
hair
was
scanty
yet
abundant
enough
to
conceal
the
skin
of
his
head
his
eyes
were
black
impassioned
relentless
and
a
ruby
star
now
shone
in
each
which
gave
them
a
forbidding
and
formidable
expression
as
they
moved
under
the
shadow
of
his
shaggy
brows
he
wore
a
coat
of
stout
cloth
confined
by
buttons
and
a
belt
round
his
waist
this
with
his
small
clothes
which
i
have
described
formed
a
very
puzzling
apparel
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
there
were
no
rents
nor
darns
nor
patches
nothing
to
indicate
that
his
attire
was
of
great
age
yet
there
was
something
in
this
commanding
person
that
caused
me
to
know
by
feelings
deeper
than
awe
or
even
fear
by
instincts
indeed
not
explicable
such
as
must
have
urged
in
olden
times
the
intelligence
to
the
recognition
of
those
supernatural
beings
you
read
of
in
scripture
that
he
was
not
as
i
was
as
are
other
men
who
bear
their
natural
parts
in
the
procession
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
the
tremendous
and
shocking
fears
of
captain
skevington
recurred
to
me
and
methought
as
i
gazed
at
the
silent
majestic
seaman
that
the
late
master
of
the
saracen
who
by
his
ending
had
shown
himself
a
madman
might
as
had
other
insane
persons
in
their
time
have
struck
in
one
of
his
finer
frenzies
upon
a
horrible
truth
the
mere
fear
of
which
caused
me
to
press
my
hands
to
my
eyes
with
a
renewal
of
mental
anguish
and
to
entreat
in
a
swift
prayer
to
that
being
whom
he
who
stood
before
me
had
defied
for
power
to
collect
my
mind
and
for
quick
deliverance
from
this
awful
situation
not
a
syllable
fell
from
the
captain
till
the
arrival
of
prins
a
bearded
man
habited
in
a
coarse
woollen
shirt
trousers
of
the
stuff
we
call
fearnought
and
an
old
jacket
he
made
nothing
of
my
presence
nor
condition
scarce
glancing
at
me
get
this
englishman
a
change
of
clothes
said
the
captain
take
what
may
be
needful
from
my
cabin
they
will
hang
loose
on
him
but
must
serve
till
his
own
are
dry
quick
you
see
he
shivers
all
this
was
expressed
in
dutch
but
as
i
have
before
said
of
an
antique
character
and
therefore
not
quickly
to
be
followed
whence
i
will
not
pretend
that
i
give
exactly
all
that
was
spoken
though
the
substance
of
it
is
accurately
reported
the
man
styled
prins
went
to
the
larboard
cabin
at
the
end
whilst
the
captain
going
to
the
table
pulled
from
under
it
a
great
drawer
which
i
had
taken
to
be
a
chest
from
which
he
lifted
a
silver
goblet
and
a
stone
bottle
drink
sir
he
exclaimed
with
a
certain
arrogant
impetuosity
in
his
way
of
pouring
out
the
liquor
and
extending
the
goblet
was
neat
brandy
and
the
dose
a
large
mouthful
i
tossed
down
the
whole
of
it
and
placed
the
goblet
that
was
very
heavy
and
sweetly
chased
on
the
table
with
a
bow
of
thanks
that
will
put
fire
into
your
blood
said
he
returning
the
cup
and
bottle
to
the
drawer
and
then
folding
his
arms
and
looking
at
me
under
his
contracted
brows
with
his
back
to
the
lantern
whilst
he
leaned
against
the
table
are
you
fresh
from
your
country
i
told
him
that
we
had
sailed
in
april
from
the
thames
and
had
lately
come
out
of
table
bay
is
there
peace
between
your
nation
and
mine
he
inquired
speaking
softly
as
though
he
feared
to
awaken
some
sleeper
though
let
his
utterance
be
what
it
would
was
always
melodious
and
rich
i
answered
no
it
grieves
me
to
say
it
but
our
countries
are
still
at
war
i
will
not
pretend
sir
that
great
britain
has
acted
with
good
faith
towards
the
batavian
republic
their
high
mightinesses
resent
the
infraction
of
treaties
they
protest
against
the
manner
in
which
the
island
of
eustatia
was
devastated
they
hope
to
recover
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
likewise
their
possessions
in
the
indies
more
particularly
their
great
coromandel
factory
mere
courtesy
would
have
taught
me
to
speak
as
soothingly
as
possible
of
such
things
though
but
for
the
brandy
i
doubt
if
my
teeth
would
not
have
chattered
too
boisterously
for
the
utterance
of
even
the
few
words
i
delivered
in
honest
truth
i
felt
an
unspeakable
awe
and
fear
in
addressing
this
man
who
surveyed
me
with
the
severest
most
scornful
gaze
imaginable
from
the
height
of
his
regal
stature
of
what
are
you
speaking
he
exclaimed
after
a
frowning
stare
of
amazement
then
waved
his
hand
with
a
gesture
half
of
pity
half
of
disdain
you
have
been
perilously
close
to
death
he
continued
and
this
idle
babble
will
settle
into
good
sense
when
you
have
shifted
and
slept
he
smiled
contemptuously
with
a
around
as
though
he
sought
another
of
his
own
kind
to
address
and
said
as
one
thinking
aloud
if
tromp
and
evertzens
and
de
witt
and
de
ruyter
have
not
yet
swept
them
off
the
seas
is
only
because
they
have
not
had
time
to
complete
the
easy
task
as
he
said
this
the
clock
over
the
door
struck
two
the
chimes
had
a
hollow
sound
as
though
indeed
it
was
the
clock
of
a
cathedral
striking
in
the
distance
glancing
at
the
direction
whence
these
notes
issued
i
was
just
in
time
to
witness
the
acting
of
an
extraordinary
piece
of
mechanism
that
is
to
say
there
arose
to
the
top
of
the
that
was
of
some
species
of
metal
the
dial
plate
of
blue
enamel
protected
with
horn
instead
of
glass
there
arose
i
say
the
figure
of
a
skeleton
imitated
to
the
life
holding
in
one
hand
an
on
which
he
turned
his
eyeless
sockets
by
a
movement
of
the
head
whilst
with
the
other
hand
he
grasped
a
lance
or
spear
that
as
i
afterwards
perceived
he
flourished
to
every
stroke
of
the
as
though
he
pierced
something
prostrate
at
his
feet
the
figure
shrank
into
the
inside
of
the
clock
when
the
chimes
were
over
as
if
to
complete
the
bewilderment
under
which
i
laboured
scarce
had
the
second
chime
of
the
clock
rung
its
last
vibration
when
a
harsh
voice
croaked
out
in
dutch
wy
zyn
al
verdomd
i
started
and
cried
out
involuntarily
and
faintly
my
god
it
was
the
parrot
that
spoke
said
captain
vanderdecken
with
a
softening
of
his
looks
though
he
did
not
smile
tis
the
only
sentence
she
seems
able
to
pronounce
it
was
all
she
could
say
when
i
bought
her
have
you
had
her
long
sir
i
inquired
feeling
as
though
i
lay
i
bought
her
from
a
chinaman
of
batavia
two
days
before
we
sailed
as
a
gift
for
my
eldest
daughter
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
prins
the
clothes
are
ready
skipper
said
he
on
this
vanderdecken
motioning
me
to
be
silent
a
piece
of
behaviour
that
was
as
puzzling
as
all
other
things
conducted
me
to
the
cabin
from
which
prins
had
emerged
and
viewing
the
clothes
upon
the
bed
said
yes
they
will
do
wear
them
mynheer
till
yours
have
been
dried
leave
this
door
on
the
hook
you
will
then
get
light
enough
for
your
purpose
from
yonder
lamp
the
dress
consisted
of
warm
knitted
stockings
breeches
of
an
old
pattern
and
a
coat
with
a
great
skirt
embellished
with
metal
buttons
several
of
which
were
missing
and
the
remains
of
some
gold
lace
upon
the
cuffs
in
addition
there
was
a
clean
linen
shirt
and
a
pair
of
south
american
hide
boots
was
like
clothing
myself
for
a
masquerade
to
dress
in
such
things
but
for
all
that
i
was
mighty
pleased
and
grateful
to
escape
from
my
own
soaked
attire
which
by
keeping
the
surface
of
the
body
cold
prohibited
my
nerves
from
regaining
their
customary
tone
i
went
to
work
nimbly
observing
that
captain
vanderdecken
waited
for
me
and
was
soon
shifted
but
not
before
i
had
viewed
the
cabin
which
i
found
to
be
spacious
enough
the
bed
was
curious
being
what
we
term
a
the
upper
ends
of
the
posts
cleated
to
the
ceiling
whilst
the
lower
legs
were
in
the
form
of
dolphins
and
had
one
time
been
gilt
with
gold
there
were
curtains
to
it
of
faded
green
silk
as
i
judged
ragged
in
places
there
were
lockers
a
small
table
on
which
lay
a
or
as
it
was
often
called
a
rude
ancient
instrument
used
for
measuring
the
altitude
of
the
sun
before
the
introduction
of
quadrant
and
formed
of
a
wooden
staff
having
a
scale
of
degrees
and
parts
of
degrees
marked
upon
it
and
which
could
be
moved
along
it
by
it
stood
a
for
turning
to
tell
the
time
by
against
the
bulkhead
that
separated
this
from
the
adjoining
cabin
were
hung
two
mirrors
the
frames
whereof
had
been
gilt
also
four
small
paintings
in
borders
richly
beaded
i
could
see
that
they
were
portraits
of
females
dim
the
hues
being
faded
the
ceiling
of
this
cabin
showed
traces
of
having
been
once
on
a
time
very
handsomely
painted
with
the
hand
other
things
i
noticed
were
a
copper
and
an
ancient
perspective
glass
such
as
poets
of
vanderdecken
time
would
style
an
optic
tube
very
weighty
and
formed
of
two
tubes
this
thing
stood
on
brackets
under
which
hung
a
watch
of
as
true
a
sphere
as
an
orange
and
of
the
size
of
one
indeed
look
where
you
would
you
could
not
fail
to
guess
how
stout
and
noble
a
ship
this
braave
as
her
captain
named
her
must
have
been
in
those
distant
years
which
witnessed
her
birth
my
costume
made
me
feel
ridiculous
enough
for
whereas
the
boots
might
have
belonged
to
a
period
when
shelvocke
and
clipperton
were
plundering
the
spaniards
in
the
south
seas
the
coat
was
of
a
fashion
of
about
thirty
years
past
whilst
the
breeches
were
such
as
merchant
captains
and
mates
wore
when
i
was
first
going
to
sea
however
being
changed
and
dry
i
stepped
forth
bearing
my
wet
clothes
with
me
but
they
were
immediately
taken
from
me
by
prins
who
had
been
standing
near
the
door
unperceived
by
me
on
my
appearing
captain
vanderdecken
rose
from
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
but
seemed
to
find
nothing
in
my
dress
to
amuse
him
the
light
was
extremely
confusing
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
pains
that
i
could
discern
the
expression
of
his
face
but
so
far
as
i
made
out
it
was
one
of
extreme
melancholy
touched
with
lights
and
shades
by
his
moods
which
yet
left
the
prevailing
character
unchanged
indeed
the
dreadful
fancies
of
captain
skevington
smote
me
fiercely
once
again
for
as
i
live
to
say
it
the
countenance
of
this
tall
and
haughty
seaman
did
suggest
to
me
the
melancholy
you
notice
on
the
face
of
the
dead
meaningless
as
that
look
in
them
may
be
but
in
his
case
irradiated
by
the
tints
and
expressions
of
vitality
insomuch
that
i
fully
felt
the
force
of
the
remark
the
master
of
the
plymouth
snow
had
made
to
captain
skevington
touching
the
man
he
had
seen
on
board
the
death
ship
namely
that
he
was
a
corpse
artificially
animated
and
most
terrible
to
behold
for
his
suggestions
of
will
you
go
to
rest
said
he
i
am
willing
to
do
whatever
you
desire
said
i
your
kindness
is
great
and
i
thank
you
for
it
ay
he
replied
spite
of
the
war
i
liefer
serve
an
englishman
than
one
of
any
other
country
the
old
and
the
young
commonwealths
should
be
friends
on
either
hand
there
are
mighty
hearts
you
in
your
blakes
your
ayscues
your
monks
we
in
our
van
tromp
whom
the
king
of
denmark
to
my
great
joy
before
i
sailed
honourably
justified
to
the
people
of
holland
and
in
van
galen
ruyter
with
other
skilled
and
men
whom
i
shall
glory
in
greeting
on
my
return
he
seemed
to
reflect
a
moment
and
suddenly
cried
with
a
passionate
sparkle
in
his
eyes
but
was
cowardly
in
your
captain
to
order
his
men
to
fire
upon
our
boat
what
did
we
seek
such
tobacco
as
you
could
have
spared
which
we
were
willing
to
purchase
by
the
vengeance
of
heaven
was
a
deed
unworthy
of
englishmen
i
did
not
dare
explain
the
true
cause
and
said
gently
sir
our
captain
lay
dead
in
his
cabin
the
men
missing
the
chief
fell
into
a
panic
at
the
sight
of
this
ship
for
she
showed
large
in
the
dusk
and
we
feared
you
meant
to
lay
us
aboard
enough
he
exclaimed
imperiously
follow
me
to
your
cabin
he
led
the
way
on
to
the
deck
and
we
descended
the
ladder
chapter
xiv
my
first
night
in
the
death
ship
i
had
been
in
too
great
a
confusion
of
mind
to
heed
the
movements
of
the
ship
whilst
i
was
under
cover
but
on
emerging
i
now
noticed
that
it
had
come
on
to
blow
very
fresh
the
vessel
under
larboard
tacks
i
could
not
see
what
canvas
she
carried
lay
along
very
much
being
light
and
tall
and
rolled
with
peculiar
clumsiness
in
the
hollows
i
caught
sight
of
the
water
over
the
and
judged
with
the
eye
of
a
seaman
that
what
progress
she
was
making
was
wholly
leeway
so
that
we
were
being
blown
dead
to
the
eastward
without
probably
reaching
as
it
is
termed
by
so
much
as
an
hour
the
moon
was
now
deep
in
the
west
and
showing
a
very
wan
and
stormy
disk
where
the
land
lay
the
sea
looked
to
rise
into
a
fluid
blackness
of
wherefrom
even
as
i
glanced
that
way
there
fell
a
red
gash
of
lightning
there
was
a
heavy
sound
of
seething
and
bombarding
billows
all
about
us
and
the
whole
picture
had
a
wildness
past
language
what
with
the
scarlet
glare
of
the
northern
and
the
ghastly
tempestuous
paleness
of
the
westering
moon
and
a
dingy
faintness
owing
its
existence
to
i
know
not
what
if
it
were
not
the
light
of
the
foaming
multitudinous
surge
reflected
upon
the
sooty
bosoms
of
the
lowering
clouds
over
our
stern
captain
vanderdecken
stood
for
a
moment
looking
round
upon
this
warring
scene
and
flung
up
his
arms
towards
the
moon
with
a
passionate
savage
gesture
and
then
strode
to
a
narrow
hatch
betwixt
the
limits
of
the
and
the
mainmast
down
which
he
went
first
turning
to
see
if
i
followed
i
now
found
myself
in
a
kind
of
with
two
cabins
on
either
hand
in
the
doorway
of
the
fore
one
on
the
starboard
side
stood
the
man
prins
holding
a
small
lantern
this
sir
said
vanderdecken
pointing
to
the
cabin
must
serve
you
for
a
sleeping
room
it
has
not
the
comfort
of
an
inn
but
is
easy
to
see
you
are
a
sailor
and
therefore
one
to
whom
a
plank
will
often
be
a
soft
couch
in
any
case
here
is
accommodation
warmer
than
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
with
a
cold
and
condescending
salute
he
withdrew
prins
hung
the
lantern
on
to
a
rail
beside
the
door
and
said
he
would
return
for
it
shortly
i
wanted
to
ask
the
man
some
questions
about
the
ship
and
her
commander
but
there
was
something
about
him
so
scaring
and
odd
that
i
could
not
summon
up
heart
to
address
him
he
appeared
as
one
in
whom
all
qualities
of
the
soul
are
dead
acting
in
sooth
like
a
giving
me
not
the
least
heed
whatever
and
going
about
his
business
as
mechanically
as
the
skeleton
in
the
cabin
clock
rose
and
darted
his
lance
to
the
chimes
of
the
bell
the
compartment
in
which
i
was
to
sleep
was
empty
of
all
furniture
saving
a
locker
that
served
as
a
seat
as
well
as
a
box
and
a
wooden
formed
of
planks
secured
to
the
side
in
which
in
lieu
of
a
mattress
were
a
couple
of
stout
blankets
tolerably
new
and
a
sailor
bag
filled
with
straw
for
a
pillow
i
was
wearied
to
the
bone
yet
not
sleepy
and
lay
me
down
in
my
strange
clothes
without
so
much
as
removing
my
boots
and
in
a
few
minutes
prins
arrived
and
took
away
the
light
and
there
i
was
in
pitch
darkness
and
yet
i
should
not
say
this
for
though
to
be
sure
no
sensible
reflection
penetrated
the
blackness
yet
when
the
lamp
was
removed
and
my
eyes
had
lost
the
glare
of
it
i
beheld
certain
faint
crawlings
and
swarmings
of
phosphoric
light
upon
the
beams
and
bulkheads
such
as
were
noticeable
upon
the
outside
of
the
ship
only
not
so
strong
i
likewise
observed
a
cold
and
ancient
smell
such
as
i
recollect
once
catching
the
breath
of
in
the
hold
of
a
ship
that
had
been
built
in
and
which
people
in
the
year
or
thereabouts
viewed
as
a
curiosity
otherwise
there
was
nothing
else
remarkable
whatever
this
vessel
might
be
her
motion
on
the
seas
was
as
natural
as
that
of
the
saracen
only
that
her
wallowing
was
more
ponderous
and
ungainly
yet
merciful
heaven
how
did
every
bulkhead
groan
how
did
every
timber
complain
how
did
every
treenail
cry
aloud
the
noise
of
the
labouring
was
truly
appalling
the
creaking
straining
jarring
as
though
the
whole
fabric
were
being
dashed
to
pieces
i
had
not
immediately
noticed
this
when
i
followed
captain
vanderdecken
below
but
it
grew
upon
my
ears
as
i
lay
in
the
blackness
yet
they
were
natural
sounds
and
as
such
they
afforded
a
sort
of
relief
to
my
strained
brain
and
nervous
yea
and
affrighted
imagination
the
stillness
of
a
dead
calm
would
have
maddened
me
i
truly
believe
phantasms
and
other
horrors
of
my
fancy
rendered
delirious
by
the
situation
into
which
i
had
been
plunged
would
have
played
their
parts
upon
that
stage
of
blackness
hideous
with
the
stirring
of
the
glow
of
rotted
timber
to
the
destruction
of
my
intellect
but
for
the
homely
thunder
of
the
sea
without
and
the
crazy
echoes
within
i
asked
myself
what
ship
was
this
that
she
had
a
supernatural
life
that
he
who
styled
himself
vanderdecken
which
tradition
reported
was
the
name
of
the
master
of
the
phantom
ship
though
it
has
been
averred
that
his
real
name
was
bernard
fokke
i
say
that
he
and
the
others
i
had
seen
more
particularly
the
man
prins
had
something
about
them
something
that
carried
them
far
out
of
the
range
of
our
common
humanity
spite
of
the
majestic
port
the
noble
presence
the
thrilling
tones
like
the
music
of
distant
summer
thunder
of
the
commander
i
could
no
more
question
than
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
as
i
lay
i
knew
by
what
i
had
heard
and
viewed
already
even
in
the
brief
hours
packed
full
of
consternation
during
which
i
had
been
on
her
that
i
was
aboard
of
the
flying
dutchman
the
phantom
ship
the
death
ship
the
sea
spectre
as
she
has
variously
been
termed
yet
there
was
so
much
to
puzzle
me
that
i
was
fit
to
lapse
into
idiotcy
if
vanderdecken
had
sailed
from
batavia
in
why
did
he
speak
of
it
as
last
year
if
the
death
ship
was
a
ghostly
object
impalpable
an
essence
only
as
is
a
spirit
why
was
this
vessel
so
substantial
that
heavily
as
she
resounded
with
the
crazy
echoes
of
her
material
state
no
could
hold
a
stouter
conflict
with
the
seas
if
she
had
been
battling
off
the
agulhas
for
one
hundred
and
years
how
came
she
to
have
oil
and
waste
for
her
lanterns
clothes
such
as
i
wore
such
as
the
men
i
had
seen
were
habited
in
brandy
blankets
almost
new
like
those
i
lay
on
and
other
stores
for
i
might
be
sure
from
the
jar
of
brandy
the
captain
had
produced
that
the
crew
ate
and
drank
as
all
men
do
and
must
these
and
other
points
i
could
not
reconcile
to
my
conviction
that
the
ship
i
was
aboard
of
was
the
craft
dreaded
by
all
men
because
of
the
great
god
ban
upon
her
and
the
misfortunes
she
brought
to
others
with
the
very
winds
which
filled
her
canvas
i
would
have
given
all
i
owned
though
alack
that
would
have
been
small
enough
if
i
lost
what
belonged
to
me
in
the
saracen
for
leave
to
keep
the
deck
but
i
did
not
venture
for
fear
of
incurring
the
displeasure
of
vanderdecken
so
for
several
hours
did
i
lay
broad
awake
in
my
black
dungeon
of
a
cabin
watching
the
loathsome
ghostly
phosphoric
glow
all
about
me
and
listening
to
the
bellowing
of
the
wind
that
had
grown
into
a
storm
and
marking
the
furious
rolling
of
the
ship
whose
wild
inner
creakings
put
a
note
of
frenzy
into
the
thunder
of
the
gale
but
never
once
hearing
the
sound
of
a
human
call
nor
the
echo
of
a
man
tread
i
then
fell
asleep
but
not
before
the
dawn
had
broken
as
i
might
tell
by
the
radiance
which
was
little
better
than
an
ashen
twilight
that
streamed
down
the
hatch
and
showed
in
an
open
space
above
the
cabin
door
chapter
xv
i
inspect
the
flying
dutchman
i
had
scarcely
fully
woke
up
when
the
man
prins
opened
the
cabin
door
and
peered
in
and
perceiving
me
to
be
awake
he
entered
bearing
a
metal
pitcher
of
water
an
earthenware
dish
and
a
rough
cloth
for
drying
the
skin
he
put
down
the
dish
so
that
it
could
not
slide
for
the
ship
was
rolling
very
heavily
and
then
poured
water
into
it
and
said
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
withdrawing
with
the
pitcher
the
skipper
is
on
the
poop
i
answered
by
asking
him
for
my
clothes
he
shook
his
bearded
face
and
said
they
are
still
sodden
and
immediately
went
out
i
might
have
guessed
they
could
not
be
dry
but
i
presented
so
hideous
a
figure
in
the
apparel
that
had
been
lent
to
me
that
i
should
have
been
glad
to
resume
my
own
coat
and
breeches
wet
or
no
wet
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
rose
and
plunged
my
face
in
the
cold
water
used
my
fingers
for
a
comb
which
sufficed
since
i
commonly
wore
my
hair
rough
having
much
of
it
and
hating
a
tye
and
putting
on
my
hat
that
had
held
to
my
head
in
the
water
and
that
had
not
been
taken
from
me
to
dry
i
stepped
out
of
the
cabin
climbed
the
steps
that
led
through
the
hatch
and
gained
what
was
in
former
times
termed
the
upper
deck
for
let
me
make
you
understand
me
by
explaining
that
beginning
right
aft
first
there
was
a
elevated
above
the
which
in
its
turn
was
raised
above
the
along
which
you
walked
till
you
arrived
at
the
forecastle
that
went
flush
or
level
to
the
bows
and
was
fortified
by
tall
stout
bulwarks
with
ports
for
for
some
considerable
while
i
stood
near
the
hatch
gazing
about
me
as
this
was
my
first
view
of
the
ship
by
daylight
right
opposite
soared
the
mainmast
an
immensely
thick
made
spar
weightier
than
we
should
now
think
of
using
for
a
craft
twice
this
vessel
size
the
top
was
a
large
circular
platform
protected
by
a
half
as
tall
as
a
man
looped
for
the
projection
of
pieces
such
as
culverins
matchlocks
and
the
like
under
the
top
hung
the
mainyard
the
sail
was
reefed
and
the
yard
had
been
lowered
and
it
lay
at
an
angle
that
made
me
understand
that
but
little
was
to
be
done
with
this
ship
on
a
bowline
the
shrouds
which
were
very
stout
though
scarce
one
of
them
was
of
the
thickness
of
another
came
down
over
the
side
to
the
channels
there
and
the
ratlines
were
all
in
their
places
only
that
here
again
there
was
great
inequality
in
the
various
sizes
of
the
stuff
used
there
were
iron
hoops
round
the
masts
all
of
them
rusty
cankered
and
some
of
them
nearly
eaten
up
i
looked
at
the
coaming
of
the
hatch
and
observing
a
splinter
put
my
hand
to
it
and
found
the
wood
so
rotten
that
methought
it
would
powder
and
i
turned
the
piece
about
betwixt
my
thumb
and
forefinger
but
the
miraculous
qualities
of
the
accursed
fabric
were
in
it
and
iron
could
not
have
been
more
stubborn
to
my
pinching
the
guns
which
i
had
on
the
previous
night
recognised
as
an
ancient
kind
of
ordnance
called
sakers
were
as
rusty
and
eaten
into
as
the
how
am
i
who
have
no
paint
but
ink
no
brush
but
a
to
convey
to
you
an
idea
of
the
mouldiness
and
rottenness
of
this
ship
was
easy
to
guess
why
she
glowed
at
night
when
you
saw
the
rail
of
her
bulwarks
and
marked
a
rugged
unevenness
such
as
i
might
liken
to
the
jagged
edge
you
observe
through
a
telescope
in
the
moon
on
the
side
where
the
earth
shadow
is
as
though
time
had
teeth
indeed
and
was
for
ever
gnawing
at
these
banned
and
timbers
as
rats
at
a
floor
there
lay
a
great
hatchway
in
front
of
the
mainmast
covered
with
tarpaulings
handsomely
mended
in
a
score
of
places
these
matters
i
took
in
with
a
sailor
quickness
also
that
the
ship
was
blowing
away
to
leeward
under
reefed
courses
above
which
no
canvas
was
shown
also
that
the
foresail
and
mainsail
had
a
very
dingy
look
and
had
manifestly
been
patched
and
repaired
many
times
over
though
whether
their
capacity
of
standing
to
a
gale
was
due
to
the
cloth
being
stout
and
substantial
still
or
because
of
their
endevilment
i
could
not
tell
nor
did
i
like
to
conjecture
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
but
as
i
afterwards
found
out
that
was
because
the
crew
were
at
breakfast
below
i
ascended
the
and
perceiving
vanderdecken
standing
on
the
poop
went
up
to
him
touching
my
hat
as
a
sailor
salute
but
the
coat
i
was
rigged
out
in
was
so
outrageously
clumsy
and
ample
that
the
wind
which
blew
very
hard
indeed
filling
and
distending
the
skirts
of
it
was
within
an
ace
of
upsetting
me
but
happily
a
lurch
of
the
ship
swept
me
towards
a
mizzen
backstay
to
which
i
contrived
to
cling
until
i
had
recovered
my
breath
and
the
surprise
i
was
under
there
was
a
small
house
in
the
middle
of
this
poop
about
ten
feet
from
where
the
head
of
the
tiller
would
come
when
amidships
possibly
designed
for
the
convenience
of
the
captain
and
officers
for
making
their
calculations
when
in
narrow
waters
and
for
the
storing
of
their
marine
instruments
flags
and
the
like
be
that
as
it
may
captain
vanderdecken
beckoned
me
to
it
and
under
the
lee
of
it
the
shelter
was
such
as
to
enable
us
to
easily
converse
i
looked
at
him
as
closely
as
i
durst
his
eyes
were
extraordinarily
piercing
and
passionate
with
the
cruel
brilliance
in
them
such
as
may
be
noticed
in
the
insane
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
hidden
in
hair
but
the
skin
of
as
much
of
it
as
was
visible
for
his
cap
was
dragged
low
down
upon
his
brows
was
pale
of
a
haggard
sallowness
expressed
best
in
paintings
of
the
dead
where
time
has
produced
the
original
whiteness
of
the
pigment
it
was
impossible
that
i
should
have
observed
this
in
him
in
the
lamplight
of
the
preceding
night
yet
did
not
his
graveyard
complexion
detract
from
the
majesty
and
imperiousness
of
his
mien
and
port
i
could
readily
conceive
that
the
defiance
of
his
heart
would
be
in
obstinacy
and
that
here
was
a
man
whose
pride
and
passions
would
qualify
him
for
a
foremost
place
among
the
most
daring
of
those
fallen
spirits
of
whom
our
glorious
poet
has
written
he
was
habited
as
when
i
first
saw
him
we
stood
together
against
this
and
whilst
he
remained
silent
for
some
moments
meanwhile
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
my
gaze
went
from
him
to
the
ship
and
the
sea
around
us
it
was
a
thick
leaden
angry
morning
such
weather
as
we
had
had
a
dose
of
in
that
storm
i
wrote
about
and
of
which
forerunners
might
have
been
found
on
the
preceding
night
in
the
lightning
in
the
and
in
the
halo
that
girdled
the
moon
the
wind
was
the
seas
had
the
height
and
weight
you
find
in
that
vast
ocean
amid
whose
hollows
we
were
driving
was
all
greyness
and
a
flying
of
spumy
rain
and
a
heavy
roaring
coming
from
the
head
of
every
sea
as
it
arched
its
summit
for
the
thunderous
downwards
rush
that
filled
the
valley
at
its
foot
with
a
boiling
of
white
water
the
sky
was
a
hard
leaden
blankness
and
whenever
there
came
a
break
of
faintness
amid
the
seemingly
stirless
ceiling
of
vapour
you
would
see
the
scud
thin
and
brown
like
drainings
of
smoke
from
a
flying
with
incredible
velocity
to
the
east
and
south
but
it
was
the
sight
of
the
ancient
ship
that
rendered
the
warring
ocean
so
strange
a
scene
that
had
i
never
before
witnessed
a
storm
at
sea
i
could
not
have
wondered
more
at
what
i
saw
she
was
lying
to
under
her
reefed
fore
and
mainsail
surging
dead
to
leeward
on
every
scend
of
the
billows
and
travelling
the
faster
for
the
great
height
of
side
she
showed
from
time
to
time
a
sea
would
strike
her
with
a
severe
shock
upon
the
bow
or
the
waist
and
often
curl
over
in
a
mighty
hissing
and
seething
though
the
wet
quickly
poured
away
overboard
through
the
ports
through
the
frame
of
what
had
once
been
a
great
poop
lantern
the
blast
yelled
like
an
imprisoned
maniac
and
shook
the
metal
with
a
sound
as
of
clanking
chains
the
vessel
had
her
topsail
and
aloft
and
the
sails
lay
furled
upon
them
the
height
of
her
poop
the
depth
of
her
waist
the
roundness
of
her
great
bulwarked
bows
her
beak
which
i
could
just
catch
a
glimpse
of
under
her
bowsprit
the
unequal
thickness
of
the
rigging
the
indescribable
appearance
of
the
sails
the
hugeness
of
the
blocks
aloft
the
whole
plunging
and
rolling
amidst
the
frothing
troughs
whilst
at
the
long
tiller
the
end
ornamented
with
a
lion
head
stood
a
man
grasping
a
rope
wound
round
the
presented
such
a
picture
of
olden
times
made
as
living
as
the
current
moment
by
the
action
of
the
seas
the
vitality
of
the
persons
i
gazed
at
the
solid
substantiality
of
the
aged
fabric
itself
that
the
memory
of
it
often
chills
my
brain
with
fear
that
i
am
crazed
and
that
my
experience
is
but
a
black
and
melancholy
fancy
victorious
over
my
understanding
and
i
say
would
to
heaven
this
were
so
for
better
that
my
soul
should
be
racked
by
a
diseased
and
disordered
mind
than
that
i
should
have
suffered
the
sorrow
the
irreparable
loss
it
is
my
present
business
to
relate
in
this
narrative
the
captain
having
inspected
me
narrowly
asked
me
how
i
had
slept
i
answered
well
for
i
was
now
resolved
to
present
a
composed
front
to
this
man
and
his
mates
be
they
and
their
ship
what
they
would
i
had
given
my
nerves
play
and
it
was
about
time
i
recollected
i
was
an
englishman
and
a
sailor
all
vessels
but
mine
said
he
in
his
thrilling
voice
glancing
about
him
with
a
scowl
catch
the
luck
of
the
wind
had
the
weather
lingered
as
it
was
for
another
three
days
we
should
have
had
agulhas
on
the
beam
and
the
ship
head
is
bitter
hard
these
encounters
of
storms
when
a
few
hours
of
fair
wind
would
blow
us
round
the
cape
he
clenched
his
hands
fiercely
and
shot
a
fiery
glance
at
the
windward
horizon
just
then
the
man
styled
herman
van
vogelaar
the
mate
arrived
and
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
me
said
something
to
the
captain
but
what
i
did
not
catch
it
doubtless
referred
to
some
job
he
had
been
sent
forward
to
see
to
i
was
greatly
struck
by
the
rugged
look
of
this
man
his
face
in
the
daylight
discovered
a
mere
surface
of
knobs
and
warts
and
wrinkles
with
a
nose
the
shape
of
one
end
of
a
plantain
that
has
been
cut
in
two
and
little
misty
eyes
deep
in
their
holes
and
surrounded
by
yellow
lashes
his
dress
was
that
of
a
sailor
of
my
own
time
but
what
affected
and
impressed
me
even
more
than
did
the
utter
indifference
manifested
towards
my
presence
by
him
and
by
the
helmsman
as
though
indeed
i
was
as
invisible
as
the
wind
was
the
pallor
underlying
the
lineaments
of
this
mate
had
i
been
asked
what
would
be
the
complexion
of
men
dug
up
from
their
graves
after
lying
there
i
should
have
pointed
to
the
countenances
of
vanderdecken
and
van
vogelaar
yes
and
to
prins
and
the
seaman
who
steered
it
was
in
truth
as
though
captain
skevington
had
hit
the
frightful
reality
in
his
dark
and
dreadful
ideas
touching
the
crew
of
this
ship
being
men
who
presented
the
aspect
they
would
have
offered
at
the
time
of
their
death
and
who
wearing
that
appearance
were
doomed
to
complete
the
sentence
passed
upon
them
no
longer
pensioners
on
the
bounty
of
an
hour
as
the
poet
young
terms
us
mortals
but
wretches
rendered
supernatural
by
the
impiety
of
that
fierce
but
noble
figure
whose
eye
looked
curses
at
the
gale
whilst
i
watched
him
the
mate
left
us
and
went
to
the
helmsman
by
whose
side
he
stood
as
if
conning
the
ship
the
captain
showed
no
heed
of
my
presence
for
a
minute
or
two
when
glancing
at
me
he
said
is
fortunate
you
speak
dutch
though
your
pronunciation
has
a
strange
sound
for
my
part
i
just
know
enough
of
your
tongue
to
hail
a
ship
and
to
say
will
send
a
boat
where
did
you
learn
my
language
i
picked
it
up
during
several
voyages
i
made
to
rotterdam
i
replied
do
you
know
amsterdam
no
sir
said
i
he
mused
a
little
and
then
said
they
will
think
me
lost
or
sunk
by
the
guns
of
the
enemy
add
the
long
and
tedious
voyage
out
to
the
months
which
have
passed
since
last
july
he
sighed
deeply
when
did
you
sail
from
amsterdam
sir
i
inquired
for
i
was
as
particular
as
he
to
say
mynheer
on
the
first
of
november
he
answered
in
what
year
said
i
he
cried
out
fiercely
are
your
senses
still
overboard
that
you
repeat
that
question
certainly
last
year
when
else
i
looked
down
upon
the
deck
i
have
reason
to
remember
my
passage
through
the
narrow
seas
continued
he
speaking
in
a
softened
voice
as
though
his
sense
of
courtesy
upbraided
him
i
sighted
the
squadron
of
your
admiral
ayscue
and
a
frigate
hauled
out
in
chase
of
me
but
the
braave
was
too
fleet
for
her
and
at
dusk
we
had
sunk
the
englishman
to
his
lower
yards
as
he
said
this
i
felt
yet
again
the
chill
of
a
dread
i
had
hoped
to
vanquish
strike
upon
my
senses
like
the
air
of
a
vault
upon
the
face
it
was
impossible
that
i
could
now
miss
seeing
how
it
was
if
this
man
together
with
his
crew
were
not
endevilled
as
captain
skevington
had
surmised
yet
it
was
certain
that
life
was
terminated
in
him
with
the
curse
his
wickedness
had
called
down
upon
his
ship
and
her
wretched
crew
existence
had
come
to
a
stand
in
his
brain
with
him
it
was
for
ever
the
year
of
our
lord
time
had
been
drowned
in
the
eternity
of
the
punishment
that
had
come
upon
him
i
lifted
my
startled
eyes
to
vanderdecken
face
and
convulsively
clasped
my
hands
whilst
i
thought
of
the
mighty
chapter
of
history
which
had
been
written
since
his
day
and
of
the
ashes
of
events
prodigious
in
their
time
and
in
memory
still
which
covered
as
do
the
lava
and
scoriæ
the
rocks
of
some
island
the
years
from
the
hour
of
his
doom
down
to
the
moment
of
our
meeting
the
peace
of
the
later
war
of
ruyter
at
sheerness
and
chatham
and
in
the
hope
a
stadtholder
of
vanderdecken
country
becoming
a
king
of
england
the
peace
of
ryswick
malplaquet
the
founding
of
the
batavian
republic
with
how
much
more
that
my
memory
did
not
carry
all
as
to
this
man
at
my
side
as
to
any
human
creature
who
had
died
at
the
hour
when
the
death
ship
sailed
on
her
last
passage
home
from
the
island

vanderdecken
shows
me
his
present
for
little
margaretha
at
this
moment
prins
stepped
on
to
the
poop
and
informed
the
captain
that
breakfast
was
ready
sir
said
vanderdecken
to
me
with
a
courtesy
that
i
guessed
to
be
as
capricious
as
his
passion
you
will
have
feared
i
meant
to
starve
you
no
mynheer
i
replied
you
will
find
our
fare
poor
he
continued
be
pleased
to
follow
me
sir
said
i
forgive
me
if
i
detain
you
for
an
instant
i
am
too
sensible
of
your
kindness
not
to
desire
that
you
will
enable
me
to
merit
it
by
serving
you
in
the
navigation
of
this
ship
in
any
capacity
you
choose
to
name
until
we
meet
with
a
vessel
that
shall
rid
you
of
my
presence
you
appear
to
have
but
a
poor
opinion
of
us
dutch
said
he
still
speaking
with
courtesy
be
pleased
to
know
that
a
hollander
is
never
happier
than
in
relieving
distress
but
come
sir
the
shelter
of
the
cabin
will
be
grateful
to
you
after
this
stormy
deck
i
said
no
more
and
gathering
the
flapping
skirts
of
the
coat
on
me
to
my
side
that
the
gale
might
not
sweep
me
off
my
legs
i
followed
him
into
the
cabin
under
the
poop
marvelling
as
i
went
at
the
miracle
wrought
on
behalf
of
this
ship
that
her
hold
should
still
yield
provisions
and
water
for
her
crew
after
a
of
use
now
you
will
have
deemed
by
this
time
that
i
had
supped
full
enough
of
surprises
but
conceive
of
my
astonishment
on
entering
the
cabin
that
was
less
darksome
than
i
should
have
conceived
it
on
seeing
a
girl
of
from
eighteen
to
twenty
years
of
age
seated
at
the
table
on
the
right
hand
of
the
captain
chair
i
came
to
a
stand
struck
motionless
with
astonishment
whilst
she
uttering
an
exclamation
of
surprise
hastily
rose
and
stood
staring
at
me
leaning
with
her
right
hand
on
the
table
to
steady
herself
it
was
as
certain
that
she
had
been
as
ignorant
of
my
presence
on
board
as
i
to
this
instant
of
her
existence
the
thought
that
instantly
flashed
upon
me
was
that
she
was
vanderdecken
daughter
that
the
curse
that
had
fallen
on
the
ship
included
her
as
it
had
all
others
of
the
vessel
miserable
company
of
men
and
that
in
consonance
with
captain
skevington
mad
but
astonishing
theory
touching
the
people
of
this
death
ship
she
discovered
the
appearance
she
would
have
presented
at
the
hour
of
her
death
though
vitalised
in
that
aspect
by
the
sentence
that
kept
the
braave
afloat
and
her
people
quick
and
sentient
i
was
the
more
willing
to
suppose
this
by
her
apparel
which
was
of
the
kind
i
had
seen
in
old
dutch
paintings
at
rotterdam
for
it
consisted
of
a
black
velvet
jacket
very
beautifully
fitting
her
figure
trimmed
with
fur
and
enriched
with
many
small
golden
buttons
a
green
silk
gown
plain
and
very
full
as
though
made
for
a
bigger
woman
there
was
a
rope
of
pearls
round
her
neck
and
i
spied
a
diamond
of
great
splendour
blazing
on
the
forefinger
of
the
hand
on
which
she
leaned
she
wore
small
red
shoes
and
her
hair
was
undressed
observation
and
the
power
of
comprehending
what
one
sees
are
rapid
otherwise
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
have
mastered
the
details
i
have
set
before
you
in
the
short
time
that
intervened
between
my
entering
the
cabin
and
seating
myself
at
the
table
yet
short
as
that
time
was
it
enabled
me
to
witness
in
this
girl
such
sweetness
fairness
and
loveliness
of
face
as
i
vow
no
man
could
conceive
the
truth
of
who
had
not
beheld
it
with
his
own
eyes
is
an
old
poet
who
writes
of
the
still
harmony
whose
diapason
lies
within
a
brow
and
of
the
sweet
silent
rhetorick
of
persuading
eyes
and
another
more
delicately
choice
yet
in
fancy
of
the
daintie
touch
the
tender
flesh
the
colour
bright
and
such
as
parians
see
in
marble
skin
more
fair
more
glorious
head
and
far
more
glorious
hair
eyes
full
of
grace
and
quickness
purer
roses
but
of
this
beauty
shining
in
that
labouring
ancient
cabin
gazing
at
me
with
an
inclined
posture
of
her
form
as
though
she
would
on
a
sudden
race
to
greet
me
what
could
the
noblest
poet
of
them
all
sing
only
to
tell
of
the
soft
violet
of
her
eyes
of
her
hair
of
dusky
gold
as
though
the
gilding
light
of
a
ruddy
beam
of
sunset
lingered
amid
the
thick
abundant
tresses
heedlessly
knotted
with
a
riband
a
little
lower
than
the
line
of
the
ears
thence
falling
in
a
bright
loose
shower
down
her
back
whilst
over
her
forehead
white
as
though
wrought
out
of
the
sea
foam
the
gilded
curls
were
gathered
in
a
shadow
only
a
little
darker
than
amber
all
this
i
saw
and
more
yet
for
whilst
i
stood
looking
at
her
the
mate
of
the
ship
van
vogelaar
arrived
and
both
he
and
the
captain
and
the
man
prins
turning
their
faces
towards
me
the
warmth
the
life
of
her
skin
the
living
reality
of
her
surprise
the
redness
of
her
lips
the
diamond
glance
of
her
eyes
were
so
defined
by
the
paleness
the
deathly
hue
of
the
flesh
of
the
men
skin
that
the
fear
that
she
was
of
this
doomed
company
fell
from
me
and
i
knew
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
one
that
was
mortal
like
myself
the
captain
pointed
to
the
bench
on
his
left
hand
i
approached
the
table
giving
the
girl
a
low
bow
before
sitting
she
curtsied
and
resumed
her
seat
but
all
the
while
looking
at
me
with
an
astonishment
that
greatly
heightened
her
beauty
nor
could
i
fail
to
see
by
the
slight
but
visible
changes
in
the
expression
of
her
mouth
that
my
presence
was
putting
a
pleasure
in
her
that
grew
as
perception
of
my
actuality
sharpened
in
her
mind
a
coarse
but
clean
cloth
that
was
a
kind
of
duck
or
drill
covered
the
table
and
upon
it
were
a
couple
of
dishes
of
cold
meat
a
dish
of
dried
fish
another
of
dried
plantains
a
jar
of
marmalade
and
a
plate
of
a
singular
sort
of
cakes
yellow
and
heavy
resembling
the
crumb
of
bread
these
things
were
kept
in
their
places
by
a
rude
framework
of
wood
set
upon
the
table
and
lashed
to
it
underneath
before
each
person
there
stood
a
silver
cup
one
of
one
design
and
size
another
of
another
also
an
earthen
plate
of
a
grey
colour
of
chinese
baking
and
of
the
kind
exported
years
since
in
great
quantities
from
batavia
and
a
knife
and
fork
of
a
pattern
i
had
never
before
seen
on
our
seating
ourselves
prins
went
round
the
table
with
two
jars
one
holding
a
spirit
which
i
afterwards
found
was
a
kind
of
gin
and
the
other
cold
water
with
which
he
manufactured
a
bumper
for
us
three
men
but
the
girl
drank
the
water
plain
not
a
word
was
said
whilst
prins
was
at
this
work
as
he
was
filling
my
cup
the
clock
over
the
door
struck
eight
the
skeleton
appearing
and
flourishing
his
lance
as
before
and
scarce
was
this
ended
when
the
parrot
croaked
out
wy
zyn
al
verdomd
i
had
forgotten
this
bird
and
the
harsh
utterance
and
dreadful
words
coming
upon
me
unawares
so
startled
me
that
i
to
my
feet
the
girl
looked
down
on
the
table
with
a
sad
face
whilst
vanderdecken
said
is
the
clock
that
excites
that
fowl
we
shall
have
to
hang
her
out
of
hearing
of
it
he
never
offered
to
make
me
known
to
the
fair
creature
opposite
but
that
did
not
signify
for
after
stealing
several
peeps
at
me
she
asked
in
dutch
but
with
the
artless
manner
of
a
child
and
in
a
sweet
voice
if
i
was
a
hollander
i
answered
no
i
am
an
englishman
madam
feeling
the
blood
warm
in
my
face
through
the
mere
speaking
with
so
delicate
a
beauty
i
too
am
english
she
cried
in
our
own
tongue
indeed
i
exclaimed
transported
out
of
myself
by
hearing
this
and
by
perceiving
how
warm
real
and
living
she
was
but
in
the
name
of
heaven
how
is
it
that
you
are
alone
upon
this
strange
ship
amid
these
mysterious
men
for
that
question
i
could
no
more
forbear
asking
right
out
than
i
could
conceal
the
admiration
in
my
eyes
whilst
i
felt
no
diffidence
in
talking
as
i
made
no
doubt
the
english
language
was
unintelligible
to
the
others
she
swiftly
glanced
at
me
but
did
not
answer
i
took
this
as
a
hint
and
was
silent
and
yet
it
did
not
seem
that
vanderdecken
or
van
vogelaar
heeded
us
they
appeared
as
men
sunk
in
deep
abstraction
even
whilst
they
ate
and
drank
some
meat
was
put
before
me
prins
offered
me
a
cake
and
being
hard
set
i
fell
to
i
found
the
meat
salt
but
sweet
and
tender
enough
and
turning
to
the
mate
asked
him
what
it
was
antelope
he
replied
yonder
pointing
to
the
other
dish
is
buffalo
sir
exclaimed
vanderdecken
with
a
wonderful
stateliness
in
his
manner
be
pleased
to
despise
ceremony
here
such
as
our
fare
is
you
are
welcome
take
as
you
may
require
and
prins
will
fill
your
cup
as
often
as
you
need
i
bowed
and
thanked
him
the
wind
blows
hard
imogene
said
he
addressing
the
girl
it
storms
directly
along
the
path
we
would
take
it
is
miserable
he
continued
turning
to
me
that
a
change
of
weather
should
come
upon
us
just
about
those
parts
where
the
breeze
freshened
into
this
gale
last
night
but
we
force
her
to
windward
yet
hey
herman
though
though
he
looked
at
the
lady
he
had
named
imogene
and
halted
abruptly
in
his
speech
but
i
noticed
he
could
not
quickly
clear
his
face
of
the
passionate
mad
look
that
darkened
it
though
it
did
not
qualify
the
paleness
of
the
skin
but
was
like
the
shadow
of
a
heavy
passing
over
the
features
of
a
dead
man
the
countenances
of
the
mate
and
prins
darkened
to
his
savage
mood
may
heaven
pardon
me
for
the
thought
but
when
i
considered
the
bitter
vexation
of
a
head
wind
and
how
this
vessel
was
being
blown
dead
away
to
leeward
faster
than
any
ship
i
could
not
but
secretly
feel
a
sailor
sympathy
with
these
unhappy
persons
though
that
this
would
have
been
the
case
had
vanderdecken
expressed
with
his
tongue
the
fearful
thoughts
which
he
looked
with
his
eyes
i
do
not
think
possible
if
i
know
myself
at
all
there
fell
a
silence
among
us
through
which
we
could
hear
the
dreary
howling
of
the
wind
the
falls
of
heavy
masses
of
water
upon
the
decks
and
the
lamentable
complaining
of
the
whole
fabric
though
as
these
noises
were
chiefly
in
the
hold
the
notes
rose
somewhat
dulled
presently
feeling
it
indecorous
in
me
to
sit
silent
i
asked
the
captain
what
his
cargo
was
he
answered
we
have
much
wrought
and
raw
silk
and
cloves
musk
nutmegs
mace
and
pepper
wood
for
dyeing
drugs
calicoes
and
such
commodities
sir
and
how
many
of
a
crew
sir
van
vogelaar
turned
to
look
at
me
ask
no
questions
exclaimed
the
girl
in
english
you
will
be
misunderstood
our
guns
are
few
but
the
braave
is
a
swift
ship
said
the
mate
with
a
very
stern
and
sullen
expression
on
his
rugged
face
she
has
outsailed
one
english
frigate
and
by
this
time
our
admirals
should
have
left
us
little
to
fear
from
the
fleets
of
your
cromwell
pray
said
the
lady
addressing
vanderdecken
and
glancing
in
like
a
sunbeam
upon
this
sudden
darkness
of
temper
tell
me
of
this
gentleman
how
it
happens
he
is
here
i
find
he
is
my
countryman
converse
with
me
about
him
if
it
were
possible
for
human
affection
to
touch
into
softness
the
fierce
majestic
countenance
of
the
noble
looking
being
whose
mien
as
he
sate
at
the
table
might
have
been
that
of
some
dethroned
emperor
with
the
pride
of
lucifer
to
sustain
him
i
might
seem
to
have
witnessed
the
tenderness
of
it
in
his
ashen
bearded
face
when
he
turned
the
cold
glitter
of
his
eyes
upon
the
girl
we
spoke
his
ship
late
last
night
when
thou
wast
asleep
imogene
and
van
vogelaar
went
in
our
boat
to
buy
tobacco
if
they
were
willing
to
sell
but
on
seeing
the
boat
they
fired
upon
her
a
light
air
blew
and
the
ship
moved
away
our
boat
was
returning
when
she
spied
this
gentleman
fast
drowning
van
vogelaar
dragged
him
out
of
the
water
and
here
he
is
saluting
me
with
a
grave
inclination
of
the
head
had
we
changed
places
said
the
rugged
mate
what
would
have
been
my
fate
a
colour
flashed
into
imogene
face
and
she
cried
oh
herr
van
vogelaar
your
pardon
if
you
please
english
seamen
are
as
humane
as
they
are
brave
yes
said
the
mate
with
a
sneer
that
rendered
his
ugliness
quite
horrible
with
the
distortion
of
it
because
english
sailors
are
brave
they
fire
upon
an
inoffensive
boat
and
because
they
are
humane
they
leave
their
comrade
to
perish
madam
said
i
softly
the
character
of
this
ship
was
known
to
us
she
slightly
raised
her
eyes
and
such
a
sadness
came
into
them
that
i
feared
to
see
her
shed
tears
meanwhile
vanderdecken
had
his
gaze
fixed
upon
me
he
seemed
to
be
musing
upon
what
the
mate
had
said
it
was
your
commodore
young
said
he
in
his
resonant
voice
that
to
be
sure
sounded
grandly
after
the
harsh
pipes
of
the
mate
who
provoked
us
why
should
your
nation
exact
the
honour
of
the
flag
has
it
bred
greater
seamen
than
holland
there
is
my
friend
willem
schouten
many
a
pipe
when
i
was
a
young
man
have
i
smoked
with
him
in
his
at
hoorn
does
even
your
drake
surpass
schouten
no
no
it
was
not
for
england
to
be
mistress
of
the
seas
he
exclaimed
with
a
solemn
shake
of
the
head
not
wanting
in
a
grave
kind
of
urbanity
i
caught
a
glance
from
the
girl
but
i
needed
no
hint
to
keep
my
tongue
still
was
maddening
and
terrifying
enough
to
hear
this
man
speak
of
schouten
as
a
friend
schouten
who
greatly
headed
the
grand
procession
of
mariners
such
as
dampier
byron
anson
and
many
others
who
since
his
day
have
sailed
round
that
cape
horn
which
the
stout
hollander
was
the
first
to
pass
and
to
name
into
the
great
south
sea
and
yet
spite
of
the
effect
produced
upon
me
by
this
man
speech
and
references
i
was
sensible
of
a
distinct
pricking
of
my
conscience
by
my
patriotism
to
hear
england
sneered
at
by
the
natives
of
a
country
which
has
been
described
by
a
poet
that
flourished
in
the
days
of
blake
and
tromp
as
the
of
the
british
sand
and
as
the
undigested
vomit
of
the
sea
was
by
no
means
to
my
liking
but
to
remonstrate
would
have
been
but
a
mere
warring
with
the
dead
the
captain
appeared
to
delight
to
talk
of
the
war
between
the
dutch
and
the
english
i
remember
that
he
praised
our
commodore
bodley
and
said
that
if
the
states
ambassador
adrian
paaw
had
been
a
person
of
understanding
the
treaty
might
have
stood
this
i
recollect
but
very
little
more
for
to
be
plain
it
was
not
only
a
frightful
thing
to
listen
to
him
but
my
thoughts
were
thrown
into
the
utmost
confusion
by
the
loveliness
of
the
lady
who
confronted
me
by
the
assurance
of
the
sweet
eyes
warm
colour
and
her
maidenly
youth
which
lived
in
every
movement
word
smile
or
sad
look
of
hers
that
she
was
no
true
member
of
the
unholy
and
fearful
company
she
lived
amongst
by
my
wondering
how
she
came
to
be
in
this
death
ship
and
how
it
happened
that
she
was
finely
dressed
not
to
speak
of
other
speculations
such
as
how
the
food
upon
the
table
was
provided
and
by
what
means
this
ship
which
i
knew
had
been
struggling
against
the
will
of
the
omnipotent
for
hard
upon
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
should
be
supplied
with
a
liberal
stock
of
the
conveniences
of
life
but
we
had
now
done
eating
the
mate
rose
and
quitted
the
table
but
his
place
was
shortly
afterwards
taken
by
another
man
whom
i
had
not
before
seen
the
second
mate
as
i
afterwards
discovered
named
antony
arents
this
person
looked
to
be
about
fifty
years
of
age
he
wore
high
boots
and
a
cloak
and
a
soft
flapping
hat
which
he
threw
down
on
entering
his
left
eye
had
a
cast
and
the
bridge
of
his
nose
was
broken
but
his
countenance
was
of
the
true
dutch
character
and
in
some
points
he
was
like
the
boatswain
antony
jans
whom
i
had
seen
on
deck
when
waking
into
consciousness
only
that
he
had
less
flesh
to
his
belly
but
in
him
was
the
same
ghastly
hue
of
skin
you
saw
in
the
others
was
in
his
hands
as
in
his
face
had
you
come
across
him
in
his
sleep
you
would
have
said
he
had
been
dead
some
days
and
indeed
never
did
i
view
a
corpse
made
ready
for
casting
overboard
that
had
the
aspect
of
the
dead
so
strong
upon
it
as
these
men
he
helped
himself
to
food
taking
not
the
least
notice
of
me
prins
meanwhile
had
put
a
box
of
tobacco
and
some
long
clay
pipes
upon
the
table
one
of
which
vanderdecken
took
and
filled
asking
me
to
smoke
i
thanked
him
wondering
what
sort
of
tobacco
time
had
converted
this
weed
into
took
the
from
the
captain
and
lighted
my
pipe
well
if
this
was
an
ancient
tobacco
age
had
not
spoilt
its
qualities
it
smoked
very
sweet
and
sound
we
are
on
short
allowance
said
the
captain
our
stock
has
run
low
it
will
be
a
hardship
if
we
should
come
to
want
tobacco
i
made
no
reply
being
determined
to
learn
all
i
could
about
this
ship
and
her
people
from
miss
imogene
before
offering
suggestions
for
though
there
is
no
living
man
whose
nose
i
would
not
offer
to
stroke
for
calling
me
a
coward
yet
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
this
captain
vanderdecken
terrified
me
and
i
feared
his
wrath
the
girl
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
fair
chin
resting
on
her
hands
which
made
an
ivory
cup
for
her
face
watched
me
continuously
with
eyes
whose
brightness
the
large
and
sparkling
diamond
on
her
forefinger
did
not
match
by
many
degrees
of
glory
are
you
long
from
england
says
she
to
me
presently
in
dutch
that
vanderdecken
might
know
what
we
talked
about
we
sailed
in
april
last
i
replied
and
you
madam
she
either
did
not
hear
the
question
or
would
not
answer
are
you
married
asked
the
captain
of
me
smoking
very
slowly
to
get
the
true
relish
of
the
tobacco
whilst
the
second
mate
chewed
his
food
with
vacant
eyes
squinting
straight
ahead
or
meeting
in
a
traverse
on
his
plate
no
sir
i
replied
are
your
parents
living
he
said
my
mother
is
alive
i
answered
ah
said
he
speaking
as
one
in
a
reverie
a
sailor
should
not
marry
what
is
more
uncertain
than
the
sea
the
mariner
wife
can
never
make
sure
of
her
husband
return
what
will
mine
be
thinking
if
we
continue
to
be
blown
back
as
we
are
now
by
these
westerly
gales
it
seems
longer
than
months
yea
it
appears
to
me
to
be
years
since
i
last
beheld
her
and
my
daughters
standing
near
the
schreyerstoren
weeping
and
waving
their
farewells
to
me
my
eldest
girl
geertruida
will
be
grown
sick
at
heart
with
her
long
yearning
for
the
parcel
of
silk
i
have
for
her
and
margaretha
he
sighed
softly
then
turning
to
imogene
he
said
my
dear
show
this
gentleman
the
toy
i
am
taking
home
for
my
little
margaretha
she
rose
with
a
look
of
pain
in
her
face
and
stepped
to
the
cabin
that
was
next
the
captain
i
now
understood
why
he
had
desired
me
to
speak
in
subdued
tones
last
night
for
that
was
the
room
in
which
she
slept
the
ease
with
which
she
moved
upon
that
heaving
deck
was
wonderful
and
this
verse
of
a
ballad
came
into
my
head
as
i
watched
her
go
from
the
table
to
her
cabin
no
form
he
saw
of
mortal
mould
it
shone
like
ocean
snowy
foam
her
ringlets
waved
in
living
gold
her
mirror
crystal
pearl
her
comb
ay
the
ocean
might
have
owned
her
for
a
child
with
such
dainty
elegant
ease
did
she
accommodate
her
form
to
the
sweep
and
heave
of
its
billows
as
denoted
by
the
motions
of
the
ship
as
some
lovely
gull
with
breast
of
snowy
down
and
wings
of
ermine
airily
expresses
the
swing
and
charge
of
the
surge
by
its
manner
of
falling
in
each
hollow
and
lifting
above
each
head
on
outstretched
pinion
her
costume
too
that
was
so
strange
a
thing
giving
to
this
interior
so
romantic
an
appearance
that
had
the
ship
been
still
and
you
had
looked
in
at
the
cabin
door
then
with
this
lady
beauty
and
dress
the
majestic
figure
of
vanderdecken
smoking
in
his
chair
the
second
mate
at
his
food
prins
standing
like
one
that
dreams
all
the
faces
but
the
girl
and
mine
ghastly
the
strange
beauty
of
the
lamp
that
swung
over
the
table
the
oval
frames
holding
paintings
so
bleared
and
dusky
that
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
the
subjects
the
dim
and
wasted
colour
of
the
cabin
walls
and
the
bald
tawdriness
of
what
had
been
rich
giltwork
the
clock
of
ancient
pattern
the
parrot
cage
i
say
had
you
been
brought
on
a
sudden
to
view
this
interior
from
the
door
you
might
have
easily
deemed
it
some
large
astonishing
picture
painted
to
the
very
height
of
the
greatest
master
perfection
in
a
moment
or
two
miss
imogene
returned
and
coming
to
the
table
placed
upon
it
a
little
figure
about
five
inches
tall
it
was
of
some
metal
and
had
been
gaily
coloured
as
i
supposed
from
what
was
left
of
the
old
tints
its
style
was
a
red
cloak
falling
down
its
back
a
small
cap
with
a
feather
shoes
almost
hidden
with
great
rosettes
hose
as
high
as
the
thigh
and
then
a
sort
of
blouse
with
a
girdle
both
arms
hung
before
in
a
very
easy
and
natural
posture
and
the
hands
grasped
a
flute
vanderdecken
putting
down
his
pipe
took
a
key
from
under
the
cloak
of
the
figure
and
wound
the
automaton
up
as
a
clock
when
it
instantly
lifted
the
flute
to
its
mouth
in
the
exact
manner
of
life
and
played
a
tune
the
sound
was
very
pure
though
piercing
the
melody
simple
and
flowing
in
all
the
figure
played
six
tunes
without
any
sound
of
the
within
and
it
was
undoubtedly
a
very
curious
and
costly
toy
the
second
mate
stalked
out
in
the
middle
of
this
performance
having
finished
his
meal
and
showing
no
more
sensibility
to
what
was
doing
than
did
the
table
the
figure
played
on
the
eyes
of
the
man
prins
had
a
sickly
faraway
look
to
be
imagined
only
for
no
one
could
describe
it
vanderdecken
lighted
his
pipe
when
the
automaton
struck
up
and
nodded
gravely
to
the
fluting
with
as
much
pleasure
in
his
face
as
so
fierce
and
haughty
a
countenance
could
express
the
girl
stood
leaning
upon
the
table
with
a
listlessness
in
her
manner
and
constantly
regarding
me
scarce
had
the
sixth
tune
been
played
when
the
parrot
called
out
from
his
cage
wy
zyn
al
verdomd
clearly
showing
that
she
knew
when
the
entertainment
was
over
her
pronouncing
these
words
in
dutch
robbed
them
somewhat
to
my
ear
of
their
tremendous
import
but
still
it
was
a
terrible
sentence
for
the
creature
to
have
lighted
on
and
i
wondered
what
her
age
was
for
she
could
not
have
been
when
vanderdecken
bought
her
as
he
had
told
me
she
then
spoke
the
same
words
however
the
captain
was
full
of
his
and
neither
he
nor
imogene
noticed
the
parrot
this
should
delight
my
little
margaretha
said
he
lifting
the
figure
and
examining
it
is
as
cunning
a
toy
as
ever
i
saw
i
bought
it
at
batavia
from
an
old
friend
of
mine
meeuves
meindertszoom
bakker
who
had
purchased
it
of
a
sailor
belonging
to
the
company
ship
revolutie
for
eight
ducats
rejoice
my
child
you
shall
present
it
to
her
imogene
i
would
not
sell
it
for
five
hundred
dollars
is
worthy
to
be
john
muller
work
he
ceased
speaking
lifting
his
hand
then
exclaimed
hark
how
the
wind
continues
to
storm
he
gave
the
figure
to
the
girl
who
returned
it
to
her
cabin
in
a
few
minutes
he
put
down
his
pipe
and
bade
prins
bring
him
his
skin
or
fur
cap
and
then
rose
impressing
me
as
keenly
as
though
i
viewed
him
for
the
first
time
by
the
nobility
of
his
stature
his
great
beard
flowing
to
the
waist
the
sharp
supernatural
fires
in
his
eyes
as
if
the
light
there
were
living
flames
in
silence
he
quitted
the
cabin
acting
like
a
man
influenced
by
spells
without
the
governance
of
the
logic
of
human
behaviour
chapter
xvii
i
talk
with
miss
imogene
dudley
about
the
death
ship
being
in
the
way
now
of
enjoying
a
talk
with
imogene
the
ridiculousness
of
the
dress
i
was
in
struck
me
and
i
asked
prins
who
was
clearing
the
table
whether
my
own
clothes
were
yet
dry
he
answered
they
were
hung
up
in
the
furnace
near
the
cookhouse
by
which
i
suppose
he
meant
the
caboose
and
that
when
they
were
dry
he
would
bring
them
to
my
cabin
in
these
things
said
i
addressing
imogene
in
english
whilst
i
turned
my
head
about
to
catch
a
sight
of
my
tails
i
feel
like
a
fool
in
a
carnival
what
ages
this
garb
represents
i
can
not
conceive
but
it
surely
does
not
represent
less
than
a
century
of
fashion
and
what
must
you
think
of
my
attire
said
she
seating
herself
in
the
captain
chair
which
her
beauty
made
a
throne
of
in
a
breath
the
light
of
her
hair
gilding
it
but
all
things
are
wonderful
here
she
added
with
a
at
prins
whose
movements
and
manner
as
he
removed
the
dishes
from
the
table
were
as
deaf
and
soulless
as
the
behaviour
of
the
figure
that
had
just
piped
to
us
you
know
of
course
what
ship
this
is
i
said
yes
in
a
subdued
voice
and
sat
down
on
the
end
of
the
bench
near
her
adding
will
the
captain
take
it
amiss
if
we
converse
no
she
answered
but
should
he
forbid
it
and
then
find
you
speaking
to
me
his
temper
would
be
dreadful
he
is
a
terribly
passionate
man
yet
he
is
gentle
to
me
and
speaks
of
his
wife
and
children
with
exquisite
tenderness
his
wife
and
children
god
help
him
oh
she
cried
trembling
i
can
not
express
to
you
the
horror
and
pain
i
feel
when
i
hear
him
talk
of
them
as
though
he
should
find
them
as
they
were
altered
by
the
length
of
a
year
only
when
he
parted
from
them
he
does
not
know
that
he
is
cursed
none
of
them
on
board
this
ship
know
it
of
themselves
is
that
so
i
exclaimed
surely
their
repeated
failures
to
pass
the
agulhas
point
must
convince
them
that
the
will
of
god
is
opposed
to
their
attempts
and
that
they
are
doomed
men
she
leaned
her
fair
cheek
upon
her
hand
with
a
thoughtful
absent
expression
in
her
violet
eyes
though
they
remained
fixed
upon
me
with
a
simplicity
extraordinarily
fascinating
i
particularly
noticed
the
beautiful
turn
of
her
wrist
the
fairy
delicacy
of
her
nostrils
and
mouth
and
the
enchanting
curve
of
her
chin
to
her
throat
her
figure
was
full
and
in
the
swell
of
her
breasts
and
the
breadth
of
her
shoulders
fining
down
into
a
waist
in
admirable
harmony
with
her
stature
and
make
you
might
seem
to
have
witnessed
every
assurance
of
robustness
but
you
found
a
suggestion
rather
than
a
character
of
fragility
in
the
beauty
of
her
face
that
caused
the
very
delight
you
took
in
the
gold
and
lilies
and
violets
of
her
loveliness
to
grow
pensive
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
embarrassment
in
her
manner
towards
me
if
you
please
what
name
am
i
to
know
you
by
she
asked
geoffrey
fenton
i
answered
and
you
imogene
dudley
i
bowed
to
her
and
she
continued
are
you
a
sailor
i
raised
my
hands
and
said
do
i
not
look
my
calling
but
recollecting
my
apparel
i
burst
into
a
laugh
and
exclaimed
touching
the
faded
finery
upon
the
cuff
of
my
coat
you
will
have
thought
me
a
beadle
or
a
footman
she
shook
her
head
smiling
but
instantly
grew
grave
and
now
spoke
in
a
most
earnest
voice
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
about
this
ship
and
about
myself
my
father
was
captain
dudley
of
portsmouth
and
nearly
five
years
ago
as
closely
as
i
can
reckon
time
where
time
has
ceased
to
all
the
others
he
commanded
a
ship
named
the
flying
fish
and
took
me
and
my
mother
with
him
on
a
voyage
to
china
we
called
at
table
bay
but
when
we
were
off
the
coast
where
algoa
bay
is
situated
the
ship
was
set
on
fire
by
one
of
the
crew
entering
the
hold
with
a
lighted
candle
and
attempting
to
steal
some
rum
the
flames
quickly
raged
the
ship
was
not
to
be
saved
the
boats
were
lowered
and
my
mother
and
i
and
a
seaman
entered
one
of
them
but
suddenly
the
ship
blew
up
destroying
the
boats
that
were
against
its
side
and
when
the
smoke
cleared
off
nothing
was
to
be
seen
on
the
water
but
a
few
pieces
of
blackened
timber
our
boat
had
been
saved
by
my
father
ordering
the
man
to
keep
her
at
a
good
distance
lest
a
panic
arose
and
she
should
be
entered
by
too
great
a
number
the
shock
so
affected
my
mother
that
she
lost
her
mind
here
imogene
hid
her
face
when
she
looked
at
me
again
her
face
was
wet
nevertheless
she
continued
she
died
on
the
night
following
the
loss
of
the
ship
and
i
was
left
alone
with
the
sailor
we
were
many
leagues
from
the
land
we
had
no
sail
the
oars
were
heavy
i
was
too
weak
and
ill
to
help
him
with
them
and
the
fierce
heat
soon
melted
the
strength
out
of
him
so
that
he
left
off
rowing
he
was
good
to
me
gentle
and
very
sorrowful
about
me
i
cried
so
much
over
losing
my
father
and
mother
and
at
our
dreadful
situation
that
i
thought
my
heart
would
break
and
i
prayed
that
it
might
for
indeed
i
wanted
to
die
she
drew
a
deep
hysteric
breath
tremulous
as
a
long
bitter
sob
we
drifted
here
and
there
for
five
days
after
which
thirst
and
hunger
bereft
me
of
my
senses
and
i
remember
no
more
till
i
awoke
in
this
ship
i
then
learnt
that
they
had
passed
our
boat
close
and
had
stopped
the
vessel
to
inspect
her
the
seaman
was
dead
and
they
supposed
me
dead
too
but
captain
vanderdecken
fancying
a
likeness
in
me
to
his
daughter
alida
called
to
his
men
to
bring
me
on
board
they
did
so
and
found
life
in
me
and
you
have
been
in
this
vessel
ever
since
cried
i
ever
since
she
responded
that
is
to
say
i
exclaimed
scarcely
realising
the
truth
for
hard
upon
five
years
she
hid
her
eyes
and
shook
her
sweet
face
in
the
cover
of
her
hands
as
if
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
i
waited
a
little
partly
that
she
might
have
time
to
recover
her
tranquillity
and
partly
that
prins
might
make
an
end
of
his
business
and
go
though
let
me
declare
he
gave
us
no
more
heed
than
had
he
been
the
clock
much
less
indeed
than
did
the
parrot
that
having
rounded
her
head
after
the
manner
of
those
birds
till
her
beak
was
uppermost
watched
us
with
the
broadside
of
her
face
and
therefore
with
one
eye
with
horrid
pertinacity
and
gravity
but
can
it
be
miss
dudley
said
i
that
captain
vanderdecken
never
intends
to
part
with
you
she
looked
up
quickly
and
said
my
position
is
incredibly
strange
he
has
a
father
fondness
for
me
and
declares
that
as
i
have
no
relations
i
shall
be
one
of
his
children
and
live
with
his
wife
and
daughters
at
amsterdam
but
he
has
no
sense
of
time
neither
he
nor
the
miserable
crew
can
compute
to
him
and
the
others
this
is
the
year
and
he
supposes
that
he
sailed
from
batavia
in
july
of
last
year
that
is
as
he
conceives
in
at
first
i
tried
to
make
him
understand
what
century
this
was
but
he
patted
my
cheek
and
said
my
senses
had
not
returned
and
when
i
persisted
he
grew
angry
and
his
temper
so
terrified
me
that
i
feigned
to
agree
with
him
and
have
ever
since
done
so
i
reflected
and
said
it
must
be
as
you
say
and
as
i
have
already
noted
for
did
the
almighty
grant
him
and
his
crew
any
perception
of
the
passage
of
time
is
it
conceivable
that
he
would
talk
of
his
wife
and
children
as
still
living
and
be
eager
to
return
to
them
when
did
you
discover
that
this
was
the
phantom
ship
i
had
heard
that
there
was
such
a
vessel
from
my
father
and
when
captain
vanderdecken
talked
to
me
and
i
marked
the
colour
of
his
face
and
the
appearance
of
the
crew
and
the
glow
that
shone
upon
the
vessel
in
the
dark
with
other
strange
things
such
as
her
ancient
appearance
i
soon
satisfied
myself
father
of
mercy
i
cried
what
a
situation
for
a
young
girl
when
i
felt
sure
of
the
ship
she
said
i
should
have
drowned
myself
in
my
misery
and
terror
only
i
dreaded
god
wrath
i
felt
that
if
i
humbly
resigned
myself
to
his
holy
will
he
would
suffer
the
spirits
of
my
father
and
mother
to
be
with
me
and
watch
over
me
but
oh
what
a
tedious
waiting
has
it
been
what
bitter
weariness
of
sea
and
sky
again
and
again
have
i
entreated
captain
vanderdecken
to
put
me
on
board
some
passing
ship
but
not
conceiving
of
the
years
which
run
by
and
every
tempest
that
obstructs
him
melting
as
a
memory
into
the
last
so
that
the
rebuffs
of
a
century
past
are
to
him
as
forgotten
things
or
possessing
the
same
sort
of
recentness
that
in
a
day
or
two
this
gale
which
is
now
blowing
will
have
he
thinks
to
encourage
me
by
saying
that
next
time
he
is
certain
to
round
the
headland
that
as
he
has
adopted
so
he
must
not
part
with
me
but
carry
me
in
his
own
ship
and
under
his
own
protection
to
his
wife
and
home
i
understood
her
and
admired
the
cleverness
with
which
she
rendered
intelligible
to
me
the
state
of
mind
of
the
captain
and
crew
of
this
ship
that
is
to
say
so
far
as
concerned
their
incapacity
to
compute
the
passage
of
the
days
for
is
it
not
evident
that
if
these
men
knew
that
they
were
doomed
never
to
round
the
cape
they
would
cease
striving
to
do
so
and
would
they
not
long
ago
have
understood
the
character
of
the
judgment
that
had
been
passed
upon
them
had
they
been
permitted
to
comprehend
that
year
after
year
rolled
on
ay
even
into
centuries
and
still
found
them
beaten
back
regularly
from
the
same
part
of
the
ocean
to
the
passing
of
which
their
struggles
had
been
directed
how
far
memory
in
them
was
suffered
to
go
back
so
as
to
count
the
number
of
times
they
were
driven
afresh
to
the
eastwards
i
could
not
imagine
but
no
doubt
imogene
who
knew
vanderdecken
well
was
right
when
she
said
that
the
recollection
of
the
last
rebuff
melted
into
every
present
one
so
that
in
short
in
this
respect
they
were
as
men
without
memory
and
this
must
have
been
so
for
they
worked
with
hope
whereas
hope
would
have
long
since
died
in
them
could
they
have
recollected
what
are
your
thoughts
i
asked
her
as
regards
their
mortality
are
they
human
yes
fenton
they
must
be
human
for
they
think
of
their
homes
and
wives
and
children
she
replied
i
was
struck
with
this
though
i
said
might
not
their
very
yearning
be
a
part
of
the
curse
for
if
you
extinguish
their
desire
of
getting
home
the
impulse
that
keeps
them
striving
with
the
elements
would
disappear
and
they
would
say
we
can
not
get
westwards
and
so
to
europe
we
head
for
the
east
and
make
for
the
indies
it
is
a
thing
impossible
to
reason
upon
she
exclaimed
sadly
and
pressing
her
hand
to
her
brow
the
great
god
here
in
this
ship
has
worked
in
miracles
and
mysteries
for
purposes
of
his
own
who
can
explain
his
ways
sometimes
i
have
thought
by
the
dreadful
hue
of
the
skin
of
their
faces
that
they
are
men
dead
in
body
but
forced
into
the
behaviour
of
living
beings
by
the
strength
of
the
curse
that
works
in
them
i
replied
that
in
saying
this
she
had
exactly
hit
upon
the
fancy
of
my
late
captain
who
had
taken
his
own
life
on
the
previous
evening
which
fancy
now
struck
me
as
an
amazing
inspiration
seeing
that
it
was
her
own
opinion
and
that
my
own
judgment
fully
concurred
in
it
is
impossible
said
she
that
they
can
be
as
we
are
they
are
supernaturally
alive
oh
it
is
shocking
to
think
of
is
it
not
wonderful
that
my
long
association
with
these
people
has
not
driven
me
mad
yet
the
captain
loves
me
as
a
father
such
is
his
tenderness
at
times
when
he
talks
of
his
home
and
strives
to
keep
up
my
heart
by
warranting
that
next
time
it
is
always
next
time
we
shall
pass
the
cape
and
all
will
be
well
with
us
that
i
am
lost
in
wonder
he
could
have
ever
so
acted
as
to
bring
the
curse
of
an
eternal
life
of
hopeless
struggle
upon
him
and
his
men
ay
cried
i
and
why
should
his
men
be
accursed
i
have
often
asked
myself
that
whilst
watching
them
she
replied
but
then
i
have
answered
why
should
innocent
little
children
bear
in
their
forms
and
in
their
minds
too
the
diseases
and
infirmities
caused
by
the
wickedness
and
recklessness
of
persons
perhaps
several
generations
removed
from
them
we
dare
not
question
is
impious
fenton
in
this
ship
especially
must
we
be
as
mute
spectators
only
for
we
are
two
living
persons
standing
amid
shadows
and
viewing
so
marvellous
a
mystery
that
i
tremble
to
the
depth
of
my
soul
at
the
thoughts
of
my
nearness
to
the
majesty
of
an
offended
god
by
this
time
prins
had
quitted
the
cabin
and
the
girl
and
i
were
alone
there
was
a
great
weight
of
sea
running
and
the
rolling
of
the
ship
was
very
violent
this
end
of
the
vessel
was
so
tall
that
it
rose
buoyant
from
the
head
of
every
billow
that
leapt
at
her
afterpart
but
the
thunder
of
the
seas
smiting
her
in
the
waist
would
roar
like
a
tempest
through
the
ship
you
could
hear
the
waters
washing
about
the
deck
there
then
the
groaning
and
complaining
below
was
continuous
and
the
sounds
which
penetrated
the
cabin
from
the
gale
in
the
rigging
made
you
think
of
the
affrighted
bellowing
of
bulls
chased
by
wolves
in
full
cry
there
seems
to
be
a
fierce
storm
blowing
said
imogene
who
had
watched
my
face
whilst
i
listened
but
since
i
have
been
in
this
ship
there
have
been
far
wilder
tempests
than
this
no
doubt
in
all
the
weary
years
you
have
spent
here
what
has
been
your
experience
of
the
winds
which
regularly
oppose
the
ship
do
they
happen
naturally
as
in
the
case
of
this
one
which
was
plentifully
betokened
by
the
look
of
the
moon
and
other
signs
or
do
they
rise
on
a
sudden
in
such
wise
i
mean
as
would
make
one
see
they
were
for
this
vessel
only
and
are
a
temporary
change
in
the
laws
of
nature
hereabouts
that
the
curse
may
be
continued
i
can
not
answer
all
that
i
can
speak
to
is
this
as
punctually
as
we
arrive
at
a
given
place
the
wind
heads
us
as
used
to
be
my
poor
father
term
and
as
all
seamen
say
and
sometimes
it
blows
softly
and
sometimes
it
rises
into
fury
but
let
it
come
as
it
will
the
vessel
is
blown
or
driven
back
a
great
many
leagues
but
how
far
i
can
not
say
for
vanderdecken
himself
does
not
know
i
would
not
trouble
her
with
further
questions
touching
what
i
will
call
the
nautical
routine
of
the
ship
and
the
manoeuvering
of
the
unhappy
creatures
the
vessel
carried
because
already
i
suspected
that
i
should
have
rather
more
leisure
than
i
should
relish
to
look
into
these
matters
myself
but
as
she
manifestly
took
a
pleasure
in
conversing
with
me
and
as
i
wished
to
obtain
all
the
information
possible
about
this
death
ship
and
as
should
vanderdecken
forbid
my
associating
with
or
addressing
her
there
might
be
no
one
else
on
board
of
whom
i
could
venture
to
make
inquiries
i
determined
at
once
to
push
my
researches
as
far
as
courtesy
permitted
i
trust
miss
dudley
said
i
finding
a
singular
delight
in
the
pure
virginal
resting
of
her
violet
eyes
sparkling
like
the
jewels
of
a
crown
on
mine
as
i
talked
to
her
that
my
questions
do
not
tease
you
oh
no
she
interrupted
if
you
but
knew
how
glad
i
am
how
it
gives
me
fresh
heart
to
hear
you
speak
to
see
your
living
face
after
my
long
desolating
communion
with
the
people
of
this
ship
indeed
i
can
conceive
it
said
i
may
god
grant
that
what
i
viewed
last
night
as
a
most
dreadful
misfortune
full
of
terror
ay
even
to
madness
may
prove
the
greatest
stroke
of
good
luck
that
could
have
befallen
me
but
of
what
is
to
be
done
we
must
talk
later
on
i
shall
require
to
look
about
me
tell
me
now
madam
if
you
will
how
is
this
ship
provisioned
surely
these
men
are
not
miraculously
fed
and
is
certain
that
the
meat
i
tasted
this
morning
has
been
cured
since
she
smiled
and
said
when
they
run
short
of
food
or
water
they
sail
for
some
part
of
the
coast
where
there
is
a
river
there
they
go
on
shore
in
boats
armed
with
muskets
and
come
off
with
all
that
they
can
kill
ha
cried
i
fetching
a
deep
breath
there
is
some
plain
sailing
in
this
unholy
business
after
all
but
how
do
they
manage
for
ammunition
surely
they
must
long
ago
have
expended
their
original
stock
i
can
but
guess
about
a
twelvemonth
ago
we
met
with
an
abandoned
ship
out
of
which
vanderdecken
conveyed
a
great
quantity
of
tobacco
powder
money
and
articles
of
food
a
few
cases
of
marmalade
and
some
barrels
of
flour
whether
these
shipwrecked
vessels
are
left
lying
upon
the
sea
for
him
to
take
provisions
from
by
the
power
that
has
sentenced
him
to
his
fearful
fate
i
can
not
say
but
since
i
have
been
in
this
vessel
we
have
fallen
in
with
three
deserted
ships
both
floating
and
ashore
on
the
coast
and
this
may
have
been
their
method
throughout
of
providing
themselves
with
what
they
needed
backed
by
such
further
food
as
i
have
never
known
them
to
miss
of
with
their
muskets
and
so
cried
i
greatly
marvelling
now
i
understand
how
it
happens
that
the
captain
can
lend
me
such
clothes
as
these
from
his
wardrobe
and
that
you
forgive
me
madam
are
attired
as
i
see
you
she
answered
in
their
hold
they
have
a
great
quantity
of
silks
and
materials
for
making
gowns
for
women
this
jacket
said
she
meaning
that
which
she
was
wearing
is
one
article
out
of
several
chests
of
clothes
captain
vanderdecken
was
carrying
home
for
his
wife
and
daughters
and
friends
do
you
notice
the
style
mr
fenton
she
added
turning
about
her
full
and
graceful
figure
that
i
might
see
the
jacket
it
is
certainly
of
the
last
century
in
the
captain
cabin
is
the
portrait
of
one
of
his
daughters
dressed
in
much
the
same
way
you
at
all
events
said
i
are
not
likely
to
run
short
of
clothes
oh
she
answered
with
a
toss
of
her
head
half
of
weariness
half
of
scorn
as
it
seemed
to
me
there
is
a
chest
in
my
cabin
full
of
clothes
fit
for
the
grandest
duchess
in
england
i
use
such
as
come
most
readily
to
my
hands
what
need
have
i
she
exclaimed
pushing
her
hair
from
her
forehead
to
care
whether
the
colours
i
take
match
or
whether
the
gown
is
too
full
this
jacket
fits
me
as
do
all
the
clothes
that
were
intended
for
geertruida
vanderdecken
then
noticing
my
eyes
resting
on
the
pearls
she
said
taking
the
beautiful
and
costly
rope
in
her
hands
there
is
a
great
stock
of
finery
of
this
kind
in
the
ship
about
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
after
i
had
been
rescued
the
captain
ordered
prins
to
bring
a
large
case
into
the
cabin
it
was
put
upon
the
table
and
the
captain
opened
it
was
like
a
shop
in
miniature
containing
several
divisions
one
full
of
pearl
ornaments
another
of
rings
of
which
he
bid
me
choose
one
to
wear
and
i
took
this
holding
up
her
forefinger
whereon
the
jewel
blazed
a
third
of
earrings
and
many
other
trinkets
some
as
i
should
fancy
more
ancient
than
this
ship
others
of
a
later
time
how
he
got
much
of
this
treasure
i
know
how
asked
i
deeply
interested
well
said
she
letting
fall
the
pearls
around
her
neck
to
toy
with
the
ring
a
fair
proportion
he
had
purchased
for
a
merchant
of
amsterdam
chiefly
eastern
jewellery
that
had
made
its
way
from
indian
cities
to
java
other
parcels
he
was
taking
home
on
his
own
account
but
much
of
it
too
along
with
a
store
of
further
treasure
some
of
which
i
have
seen
and
which
consists
of
virgin
silver
bars
of
gold
coated
with
pewter
to
deceive
the
pirates
and
buccaneers
candlesticks
and
crucifixes
of
precious
metal
he
found
in
the
wreck
of
a
great
spanish
ship
which
lay
abandoned
and
going
to
pieces
on
a
shoal
off
the
coast
of
natal
this
happened
during
his
progress
from
batavia
to
the
cape
before
he
was
cursed
and
therefore
it
falls
within
his
memory
what
other
treasure
there
is
his
men
have
no
doubt
brought
away
from
the
wrecked
vessels
they
have
examined
for
food
powder
and
the
like
during
the
years
they
have
been
sailing
about
this
ocean
so
cried
i
lost
in
amazement
by
what
i
heard
it
is
in
this
fashion
that
the
phantom
ship
supplies
her
wants
as
ships
grow
more
numerous
her
opportunities
will
increase
for
is
terrible
to
think
of
the
number
of
vessels
which
go
and
besides
this
is
the
road
to
india
along
which
pass
the
most
richly
freighted
of
merchant
fleets
now
i
understand
how
vanderdecken
manages
to
keep
his
crew
supplied
with
clothes
and
his
ship
with
sails
and
cordage
but
lord
cried
i
if
there
be
nothing
magical
in
this
yet
surely
the
evil
spirit
must
be
suffered
to
have
a
hand
in
the
keeping
of
the
bones
of
this
old
fabric
together
as
i
said
this
prins
entered
the
cabin
and
said
shortly
your
clothes
are
dry
mynheer
they
are
below
on
which
imogene
rose
and
giving
me
a
bow
went
to
her
own
cabin
chapter
xviii
the
death
ship
must
be
slow
at
plying
i
stood
a
moment
or
two
at
the
door
watching
the
clock
whilst
it
struck
and
greatly
admiring
the
workmanship
of
the
skeleton
that
rose
and
speared
with
his
lance
keeping
time
to
the
sonorous
chiming
which
sang
with
a
solemn
interval
between
each
beat
the
great
age
of
this
was
beyond
question
but
the
horn
that
protected
the
face
of
it
prevented
me
from
perceiving
if
there
was
any
maker
name
or
date
there
as
the
skeleton
sank
i
could
not
but
admire
the
aptness
of
the
mechanism
to
the
condition
of
the
ship
and
her
crew
for
what
could
surpass
the
irony
of
this
representation
of
death
perpetually
foiled
in
his
efforts
to
slay
time
which
was
yet
the
case
of
vanderdecken
and
his
men
whose
mortality
was
constrained
to
an
endless
triumph
over
that
force
which
drives
all
men
born
of
woman
through
nature
into
eternity
the
parrot
hanging
near
i
stayed
yet
to
look
at
her
and
then
spoke
to
the
creature
in
my
rugged
dutch
but
to
no
purpose
with
the
slow
motion
of
her
kind
she
contorted
herself
until
with
her
beak
uppermost
she
brought
her
larboard
eye
to
bear
full
upon
me
and
so
fixed
and
unwinking
was
her
stare
that
i
greatly
disliked
it
nay
felt
that
if
i
lingered
i
should
fear
it
and
was
going
when
she
brought
me
to
a
stand
by
a
hollow
ha
ha
ha
just
such
a
note
as
fancy
would
give
to
the
ghost
of
a
dutchman
who
had
been
large
fat
and
guttural
when
alive
could
the
spectre
of
such
a
one
laugh
in
his
coffin
or
in
a
vault
the
age
which
this
bird
had
attained
made
her
mere
appearance
chilling
to
the
blood
though
i
am
aware
these
creatures
are
and
that
no
man
with
certainty
could
say
they
might
not
flourish
two
hundred
years
and
more
she
was
not
bald
all
her
feathers
were
sound
and
smooth
yet
as
i
made
my
way
to
my
cabin
it
terrified
me
into
downright
despondency
to
conceive
of
this
parrot
sharing
in
the
curse
that
vanderdecken
had
provoked
for
if
this
soulless
fowl
could
be
involved
in
the
general
fate
merely
because
it
happened
to
be
in
the
ship
why
might
not
my
lot
prove
the
same
oh
my
heart
to
think
of
becoming
one
of
the
crew
partaking
their
horrid
destiny
and
in
due
course
dying
to
live
again
accurst
and
miraculously
my
soul
as
theirs
existing
in
my
body
like
one
of
those
feeble
lamps
with
which
the
ancients
illumined
their
tombs
but
i
was
young
and
was
not
without
an
englishman
courage
i
could
gaze
backwards
and
perceive
in
my
life
no
sin
such
as
should
fill
me
with
remorse
and
hopelessness
in
a
time
like
this
i
believed
in
my
creator
goodness
and
reaching
my
darksome
cabin
i
knelt
down
and
prayed
and
after
awhile
recollected
myself
and
felt
the
warmth
of
my
former
spirit
i
was
mighty
pleased
to
recover
my
own
clothes
they
gave
me
back
the
sense
of
my
being
my
true
self
again
whereas
the
masquerading
attire
vanderdecken
had
lent
me
occasioned
a
wretched
feeling
as
of
belonging
to
the
ship
when
i
had
shifted
myself
i
neatly
folded
the
coat
breeches
and
the
rest
and
then
sat
down
on
my
bed
to
think
over
my
conversation
with
miss
dudley
what
to
credit
what
to
make
of
her
i
hardly
knew
she
was
so
beautiful
where
all
was
ugly
so
fresh
where
all
was
decayed
so
young
where
all
was
withered
so
radiant
where
all
was
darksome
that
on
board
such
a
ship
as
this
that
had
been
consigned
to
the
most
dreadful
doom
the
imagination
of
man
could
conceive
of
how
was
i
to
know
that
she
was
not
some
part
of
the
scheme
of
retribution
a
sweet
and
dazzling
tantaliser
a
mocker
of
the
home
affections
of
the
miserable
ship
company
a
lovely
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
life
to
serve
some
purpose
of
an
inscrutable
nature
in
its
influence
upon
such
spiritual
vitality
as
was
permitted
to
the
beings
who
navigated
this
death
ship
but
this
was
a
fleeting
fancy
only
and
was
rendered
utterly
ridiculous
by
recurrence
to
her
transporting
figure
the
golden
warmth
of
her
hair
and
complexion
and
above
all
to
the
fragility
of
her
lineaments
which
stamped
her
mortal
no
her
story
was
the
truth
itself
but
this
i
understood
if
vanderdecken
were
never
to
comprehend
his
doom
there
was
stern
assurance
of
his
holding
the
girl
to
his
ship
until
she
died
because
as
she
had
pointed
out
he
had
adopted
her
and
desired
to
take
her
home
and
would
never
understand
he
was
powerless
to
do
so
even
should
time
represent
the
truth
to
him
in
her
face
should
she
ever
grow
old
enough
for
wrinkles
and
grey
hairs
had
i
been
sent
to
deliver
her
god
knoweth
i
thought
yet
what
was
my
own
case
would
they
refuse
to
let
me
leave
them
well
that
idea
did
not
frighten
me
for
he
is
a
poor
sailor
who
can
not
find
a
means
of
escape
from
a
ship
he
dislikes
even
though
she
should
be
commanded
by
old
nick
himself
but
suppose
they
compelled
me
to
go
set
me
ashore
in
their
boat
or
hailed
some
unsuspecting
vessel
that
would
receive
me
i
should
then
be
powerless
to
rescue
imogene
from
this
frightful
situation
for
as
to
subsequently
helping
to
succour
her
first
of
all
i
doubted
whether
i
should
find
a
sailor
in
any
part
of
the
world
willing
to
ship
for
a
cruise
in
search
of
vanderdecken
craft
and
next
even
if
i
should
be
able
to
range
a
ship
alongside
this
venerable
frame
how
should
human
artillery
advantage
us
in
such
a
conflict
be
but
another
defiance
of
the
divine
intention
and
what
mariner
was
to
be
found
who
would
embark
on
any
adventure
against
this
dread
spectre
of
the
deep
when
by
so
doing
he
would
feel
that
he
was
fighting
a
vengeance
which
would
swiftly
deal
with
him
for
so
great
an
act
of
impiety
however
no
good
could
come
of
meditations
of
this
kind
in
that
gloomy
cabin
filled
with
the
echoes
of
the
groaning
in
the
hold
and
the
washing
and
shocks
of
the
seas
without
i
felt
a
seaman
curiosity
to
have
a
good
look
at
a
ship
of
which
there
were
a
thousand
stories
afloat
in
every
forecastle
throughout
the
world
and
so
i
climbed
through
the
hatch
on
deck
dressed
in
the
style
in
which
i
had
made
my
first
appearance
the
second
mate
antony
arents
conned
the
vessel
standing
near
the
helm
with
his
arms
folded
in
a
sullen
moody
posture
even
so
as
to
resemble
a
man
turned
into
stone
vanderdecken
was
at
the
erect
and
his
legs
parted
in
the
attitude
of
a
stride
that
he
might
balance
himself
to
the
rolling
deck
he
stared
fixedly
to
the
windward
his
great
beard
disparted
blowing
like
smoke
over
either
shoulder
and
his
brows
lowered
into
a
contemptuous
scowl
upon
his
sharp
burning
eyes
the
ship
was
under
the
same
canvas
i
had
before
noticed
on
her
her
yards
were
as
closely
pointed
to
the
wind
as
the
lee
braces
could
bring
them
but
whereas
in
our
time
a
vessel
can
be
brought
to
within
six
points
that
is
to
say
if
the
gale
be
north
she
can
be
made
to
head
yet
this
ship
as
i
easily
gathered
without
looking
at
the
compass
lay
no
closer
than
or
nine
points
the
wind
blowing
and
we
lying
by
as
close
as
the
trim
of
the
yards
would
suffer
us
at
about
in
short
we
were
being
driven
at
the
rate
of
some
three
or
four
miles
an
hour
dead
to
leeward
broadside
on
now
as
i
am
writing
this
in
the
main
that
all
mariners
may
have
a
just
and
clear
conception
of
the
sort
of
ship
vanderdecken
vessel
is
i
particularly
desire
that
this
matter
of
her
not
being
able
to
sail
within
eight
or
nine
points
of
the
wind
be
carefully
noted
for
then
you
shall
understand
how
fully
with
her
own
tackling
and
yards
and
canvas
she
helps
out
and
fulfils
her
doom
if
ever
you
have
read
the
account
of
my
lord
anson
voyage
round
the
world
you
will
recollect
in
the
second
chapter
of
book
the
narrative
given
at
length
of
the
time
occupied
by
the
gloucester
in
fetching
and
casting
anchor
off
juan
fernandez
she
could
make
no
way
at
all
in
beating
or
reaching
she
was
first
sighted
from
the
island
on
the
of
june
she
was
still
striving
against
the
head
wind
on
the
of
july
then
she
was
blown
away
and
reappeared
on
the
and
it
was
not
until
the
of
that
month
that
she
was
seen
opening
the
point
of
the
bay
with
a
flowing
sail
which
means
that
she
had
a
fair
wind
and
which
may
also
be
said
to
signify
that
had
the
wind
not
favoured
her
she
might
have
gone
on
struggling
for
years
without
making
the
island
think
now
of
a
vessel
very
nearly
fitted
as
our
ships
are
rigged
occupying
days
a
whole
month
and
a
day
atop
in
covering
a
distance
which
when
the
gloucester
was
first
sighted
was
reckoned
at
four
leagues
is
it
then
surprising
that
a
vessel
constructed
considerably
more
than
a
century
earlier
than
the
ships
of
anson
squadron
in
an
age
when
the
art
of
building
was
little
understood
when
a
ship
hull
was
as
tall
as
a
great
castle
when
all
things
aloft
were
ponderous
when
the
immense
beam
helped
yet
by
the
wide
channels
gave
such
a
spread
to
the
shrouds
that
they
could
make
of
the
breeze
no
more
than
a
beam
wind
when
braced
up
as
sharp
as
the
yards
would
come
is
it
surprising
i
say
that
this
dutchman
so
constructed
should
never
be
able
to
contend
with
a
contrary
wind
i
am
the
more
pleased
to
point
this
out
because
i
have
heard
it
particularly
affirmed
that
if
vanderdecken
were
a
good
seaman
he
would
laugh
at
a
though
there
should
be
no
other
wind
in
those
seas
for
he
need
do
nothing
but
make
a
long
board
to
the
south
to
as
far
say
as
fifty
degrees
in
order
with
his
starboard
tacks
aboard
to
pass
the
cape
and
enter
the
atlantic
where
he
would
probably
catch
the
trade
wind
and
so
make
good
his
return
but
this
presupposes
no
sentence
even
if
the
ship
were
capable
of
sailing
to
resume
neither
the
captain
nor
the
second
mate
nor
the
seaman
at
the
tiller
taking
the
least
notice
of
me
i
determined
to
keep
myself
to
myself
till
it
should
please
vanderdecken
to
address
me
so
i
got
under
the
lee
of
the
house
where
i
had
conversed
with
the
captain
before
breakfast
and
gazed
about
it
was
as
dirty
a
day
as
ever
i
remember
the
heavens
of
the
colour
of
drenched
granite
the
swallowed
up
in
spray
and
haze
out
of
which
there
came
rolling
to
the
ship
endless
processions
of
prodigious
combers
the
storming
aloft
was
a
perpetual
thunder
upon
every
rope
the
gale
split
with
a
shriek
and
there
was
a
dreary
clattering
of
the
cordage
and
as
the
vessel
swang
her
spars
to
windward
an
edge
of
peculiar
and
fierceness
would
be
put
into
the
wind
as
though
it
were
driven
outrageously
mad
by
the
stubborn
swing
of
the
masts
against
its
howling
face
nothing
was
in
sight
save
over
against
our
a
cape
hen
poised
on
such
easy
wings
that
the
appearance
of
the
bird
made
a
wonder
of
the
weight
of
the
blast
its
solitariness
gave
a
heavy
desolation
to
the
aspect
of
the
pouring
warring
scene
of
frothing
summits
and
roaring
hollows
the
reefed
courses
under
which
the
vessel
lay
were
dark
with
wet
from
the
showering
of
the
sea
of
which
great
green
glittering
masses
striking
the
raised
such
a
smoke
of
crystals
all
about
the
forecastle
that
the
vessel
looked
to
be
on
fire
with
the
voluminous
whiteness
soaring
there
there
were
a
few
men
on
the
decks
that
way
muffled
up
to
their
noses
but
i
did
not
see
them
speak
to
one
another
nor
go
about
any
kind
of
work
they
had
the
same
nay
entranced
air
that
was
visible
in
those
such
as
the
two
mates
and
vanderdecken
whom
i
had
already
observed
the
ship
offered
an
amazing
picture
as
she
soared
and
sank
upon
the
billows
by
storms
of
froth
swept
by
the
wind
betwixt
the
masts
with
wilder
screamings
than
a
hundred
could
make
the
great
barricaded
tops
her
spritsail
topmast
standing
up
out
of
another
top
at
the
end
of
the
bowsprit
she
had
no
jibboom
and
the
long
yard
after
the
on
her
gave
her
so
true
a
look
of
the
age
in
which
she
had
been
built
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
sailor
to
see
her
and
not
know
what
ship
she
was
none
other
resembling
her
has
been
afloat
since
the
age
of
william
nor
is
it
conceivable
that
the
like
of
her
will
ever
be
seen
again
chapter
xix
i
witness
the
captain
entrancement
i
had
been
on
deck
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
vanderdecken
who
all
this
time
was
standing
motionless
at
the
rail
looking
as
who
shall
tell
with
what
fancies
in
him
and
what
visions
at
the
windward
sea
came
down
to
the
lee
of
the
house
as
though
he
all
along
knew
i
was
there
though
i
can
swear
he
never
once
turned
nor
appeared
to
see
me
and
said
is
the
lady
in
the
cabin
she
went
to
her
room
sir
i
replied
did
she
tell
you
her
story
he
said
bringing
his
beard
to
its
place
with
both
hands
and
viewing
me
with
a
severity
that
i
began
to
think
might
be
as
much
owing
to
the
cast
of
his
features
as
to
his
nature
i
replied
that
she
had
told
me
how
he
had
met
with
her
in
an
open
boat
how
her
parents
had
perished
and
how
he
had
felt
a
father
pity
and
love
for
her
and
was
taking
her
home
to
adopt
her
he
exclaimed
she
shall
be
a
child
of
mine
my
wife
will
soon
love
her
and
she
will
be
a
sister
to
my
daughters
she
has
no
relatives
and
such
beauty
and
sweetness
of
heart
as
hers
must
be
cared
for
since
how
does
the
world
commonly
serve
such
graces
when
they
meet
in
a
friendless
woman
surely
thought
i
he
that
can
talk
thus
can
not
be
endevilled
and
yet
does
not
the
great
milton
bestow
the
tenderness
of
a
sister
and
a
daughter
on
sin
when
she
reconciles
satan
and
death
something
of
human
nature
there
must
ever
be
even
in
those
who
most
strictly
merit
heaven
chastisement
and
the
lustre
of
the
glory
in
our
beginning
though
it
wane
till
its
glow
is
no
brighter
than
the
dim
fiery
crawlings
upon
this
ship
side
at
night
is
never
utterly
extinguished
in
the
blackest
spirit
of
us
all
i
had
no
desire
to
talk
of
miss
dudley
lest
i
should
put
him
into
a
passion
by
some
remark
touching
the
number
of
years
she
had
now
been
on
board
or
by
blundering
in
some
other
like
manner
if
she
was
to
escape
through
me
it
behoved
me
to
keep
my
thoughts
mighty
close
and
secret
for
let
what
would
be
the
state
of
being
he
had
entered
into
in
two
centuries
of
existence
his
eyes
were
like
a
as
though
he
could
focus
by
them
the
fires
of
suspicion
and
scorch
a
hole
through
your
body
to
your
soul
to
learn
what
was
passing
there
so
putting
on
an
easy
manner
and
throwing
a
glance
aloft
and
around
i
said
i
fear
mynheer
you
find
weather
of
this
kind
strain
your
ship
a
good
deal
like
all
vessels
she
will
work
in
such
seas
as
this
he
replied
how
often
is
she
careened
i
asked
how
often
should
she
need
it
think
you
he
replied
with
sudden
temper
i
said
warily
i
can
not
imagine
i
have
commanded
the
braave
for
five
voyages
said
he
softening
a
little
and
only
once
that
is
during
the
second
voyage
did
she
prove
leaky
but
this
voyage
she
has
been
troublesome
and
i
have
had
to
careen
her
twice
twice
only
thought
i
but
you
could
see
that
his
memory
had
been
shaped
so
as
to
fit
his
doom
and
that
remembrance
of
all
that
befell
him
and
his
crew
from
the
time
when
his
sentence
was
first
pronounced
faded
almost
as
swiftly
as
they
happened
like
clouds
upon
the
blankness
of
the
heavens
so
that
the
very
changes
that
would
illustrate
the
passage
of
time
to
you
or
me
such
as
the
alteration
in
the
rigs
and
shapes
of
the
ships
he
met
or
the
growth
into
womanhood
of
the
girl
he
had
rescued
would
be
as
unmeaning
to
him
and
his
fellows
as
to
men
without
memory
yet
was
it
manifestly
part
of
the
curse
that
he
should
have
a
keen
and
bright
recollection
of
his
house
his
family
amsterdam
the
politics
and
wars
of
his
age
and
the
like
for
if
the
faculty
was
wholly
dead
in
him
he
would
be
but
as
a
corpse
without
that
craving
for
home
which
perpetuates
his
doom
is
there
any
good
spot
for
careening
on
the
coast
east
of
the
cape
said
i
eager
to
gather
all
i
could
touching
the
practices
and
inner
life
of
this
wondrous
ship
without
appearing
inquisitive
he
answered
yes
there
is
one
good
place
is
in
a
bay
i
can
not
name
it
but
it
is
to
be
found
by
the
peculiar
shape
of
the
mountains
at
its
back
if
ever
you
should
be
in
these
seas
and
need
to
careen
choose
that
place
for
besides
that
you
may
refresh
your
crew
with
and
lay
in
a
good
store
of
when
in
season
oranges
plums
wild
apricot
lemons
plantains
and
other
fruits
with
abundance
of
such
fish
as
cod
hake
and
mullet
and
comforts
and
dainties
such
as
plovers
partridges
and
bustards
you
will
there
find
a
salt
spring
the
water
of
which
on
boiling
yields
salt
enough
for
any
quantity
of
curing
and
what
should
not
be
less
useful
to
you
as
a
mariner
to
know
is
that
about
the
shore
you
find
scattered
a
kind
of
munjack
which
when
boiled
with
sand
and
tempered
with
oil
is
as
good
as
pitch
for
paying
your
seams
with
so
thought
i
and
thither
then
is
it
that
you
are
led
when
your
ship
needs
to
be
overhauled
or
when
your
provisions
run
low
with
oakum
worked
from
such
ropes
as
he
would
find
on
abandoned
ships
and
the
munjack
he
spoke
about
he
would
have
no
trouble
in
keeping
the
frame
of
the
vessel
tight
more
especially
as
the
supernatural
quality
that
was
in
his
own
life
was
in
that
of
his
ship
likewise
so
that
the
timber
stood
as
did
his
skin
albeit
the
one
would
often
need
repairs
just
as
the
body
of
the
other
was
sustained
by
meat
and
drink
i
thank
you
for
your
information
captain
said
i
if
he
continued
you
let
the
plantain
dry
it
will
crush
into
an
excellent
flour
the
cakes
we
had
at
breakfast
were
formed
of
it
is
wonderful
said
i
how
the
mariner
forces
the
sea
and
the
land
that
skirts
it
to
supply
his
needs
ay
he
exclaimed
it
is
as
you
say
but
no
sailors
surpass
the
dutch
in
this
particular
direction
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
go
on
speaking
but
looking
that
i
might
attend
to
his
words
i
observed
that
the
whole
man
with
amazing
suddenness
appeared
to
undergo
a
change
he
stood
motionless
gazing
at
the
leeward
sea
his
features
fixed
not
the
faintest
working
in
them
and
nothing
stirring
but
his
beard
he
was
like
one
in
a
fit
save
for
the
frightful
vitality
he
got
from
the
glare
in
his
eyes
which
were
rooted
as
though
they
beheld
a
phantom
i
drew
away
from
him
with
a
shudder
for
his
aspect
now
was
the
most
terrible
revelation
of
his
monstrous
and
unearthly
existence
that
had
been
made
to
me
the
change
was
of
the
violence
of
a
catalepsy
and
this
quick
transition
from
the
intelligent
if
looks
of
a
man
speaking
of
homely
matters
to
a
mute
petrified
figure
to
which
the
fire
of
the
eyes
imparted
an
inexpressible
element
of
horror
so
terrified
me
that
i
felt
the
in
the
palms
of
my
hands
as
to
reasoning
on
this
condition
of
his
why
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
it
looked
as
if
the
death
that
was
in
his
flesh
and
bones
finding
his
spirit
or
whatever
it
was
that
informed
him
languid
as
the
senses
became
through
grief
or
sickness
asserted
its
powers
till
it
was
driven
into
its
again
by
the
of
the
supernatural
element
that
possessed
him
it
was
also
apparent
that
this
unnatural
gift
of
life
did
but
give
vitality
to
a
corpse
and
that
even
as
a
disinterred
body
that
still
wears
the
very
tint
of
life
as
though
but
just
dead
falls
into
dust
on
the
air
of
heaven
touching
it
so
do
i
strictly
believe
that
vanderdecken
and
his
crew
would
instantly
crumble
into
ashes
which
the
wind
would
disperse
were
the
power
that
keeps
them
intelligent
and
capable
of
moving
suspended
by
which
i
mean
that
they
would
not
decay
slowly
as
the
dead
in
nature
do
but
that
they
would
dissolve
into
dust
as
men
who
deceased
a
hundred
years
ago
these
thoughts
are
not
gay
but
what
think
you
of
the
reality
never
could
i
so
fully
compass
all
the
horror
of
the
curse
as
now
when
i
turned
my
gaze
from
the
figure
at
my
side
majestic
in
his
marble
motionlessness
and
alive
in
the
eyes
only
to
the
strained
grey
streaming
ancient
ship
tossing
her
forking
bowsprit
to
the
sullen
gloom
on
high
bringing
her
aged
patched
and
dingy
courses
groaning
at
their
tacks
with
a
sulky
thunder
against
the
screaming
gale
as
though
their
hollows
dimly
reverberated
yet
the
cannonading
of
the
vanished
fleets
of
blake
and
tromp
washed
by
seas
which
fled
in
over
her
forward
decks
heavily
and
dismally
rolling
broadside
to
the
wind
that
was
blowing
her
with
diabolic
stubbornness
back
along
the
liquid
path
that
she
had
so
lately
sailed
over
think
of
such
a
life
as
this
great
mercy
would
not
even
a
year
of
such
a
struggle
prove
to
us
distracting
oh
is
a
merciful
provision
indeed
that
these
poor
wretches
should
have
had
all
sense
of
time
killed
in
them
and
that
their
punishment
should
lie
in
a
perpetual
cheating
of
hope
too
as
a
remembrance
to
break
their
hearts
yet
there
were
now
two
persons
in
this
death
ship
to
whom
such
solace
as
was
permitted
to
the
accurst
crew
would
not
be
granted
and
who
if
they
could
not
get
away
from
the
vessel
would
have
to
lead
a
more
terrible
life
than
even
that
of
the
dutch
mariners
unless
they
destroyed
themselves
as
captain
skevington
had
and
for
some
time
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
how
i
was
to
rescue
miss
dudley
and
make
my
own
escape
for
one
thing
i
had
already
resolved
never
to
leave
the
girl
alone
in
this
ship
chapter
xx
i
hold
a
conversation
with
the
crew
there
was
nothing
in
sight
indeed
in
that
thick
gale
a
vessel
would
have
had
to
come
within
a
mile
of
us
to
be
visible
as
vanderdecken
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
to
me
i
feared
he
might
take
it
ill
if
i
hung
by
his
side
for
how
was
i
to
tell
but
that
he
might
consider
i
should
regard
the
withdrawal
of
his
attention
as
a
hint
to
begone
i
therefore
walked
aft
the
second
mate
no
more
heeding
me
than
if
i
had
been
as
viewless
as
the
air
whilst
the
helmsman
after
turning
a
small
pair
of
glassy
eyes
upon
me
stained
with
veins
directed
them
again
at
the
sea
over
the
bow
his
face
as
sullenly
thoughtful
as
the
others
albeit
he
handled
the
tiller
with
good
judgment
meeting
her
as
we
sailors
say
when
she
needed
it
and
holding
a
very
clean
and
careful
luff
my
curiosity
being
great
i
ventured
to
peep
into
the
binnacle
or
bittacle
as
it
was
formerly
called
a
fixed
box
or
case
for
holding
the
mariner
compass
the
card
was
very
as
may
be
supposed
yet
it
swung
to
the
movement
of
the
ship
and
i
could
not
suppose
that
it
was
very
inaccurate
since
by
the
aid
of
it
they
periodically
made
the
land
where
they
hunted
for
meat
and
filled
their
casks
as
neither
vanderdecken
nor
antony
arents
offered
to
hinder
me
from
roaming
about
i
determined
since
i
was
about
it
to
take
a
good
look
at
this
death
ship
i
examined
the
swivels
which
were
very
green
with
decay
and
tried
to
revolve
one
on
its
pivot
but
found
that
it
was
not
to
be
stirred
the
tiller
had
been
a
very
noble
piece
of
timber
but
now
presented
the
aspect
of
rottenness
that
all
the
rest
of
the
wood
in
the
ship
had
yet
it
had
been
very
elegantly
carved
and
numerous
flourishes
still
overran
it
though
the
meaning
of
the
devices
was
not
to
be
come
at
the
rudder
head
worked
in
a
great
through
which
a
corpulent
man
of
eighteen
stone
might
have
slipped
fair
into
the
sea
underneath
the
gale
made
a
melancholy
screeching
in
the
skeleton
lantern
and
i
wondered
they
did
not
unship
the
worthless
thing
and
heave
it
overboard
i
looked
over
the
side
and
as
far
down
as
i
could
carry
my
sight
and
i
observed
that
the
ship
was
of
a
sickly
sallow
colour
not
yellow
indeed
of
no
hue
that
i
could
give
a
name
to
though
the
original
tint
a
painter
might
conjecture
by
guessing
what
colour
would
yield
this
nameless
pallidness
after
years
and
years
of
washing
seas
and
the
burning
of
the
sun
i
then
thought
i
would
step
forward
not
much
minding
the
washing
of
the
seas
there
and
passed
vanderdecken
very
cautiously
ready
to
stop
if
he
should
look
at
me
but
he
remained
in
a
trance
like
a
stone
figure
all
the
life
of
him
gone
into
his
eyes
which
glared
burning
and
terrible
at
the
same
part
of
the
ocean
at
which
he
stared
when
i
first
observed
him
stirless
so
i
stepped
past
and
descended
to
the
where
there
was
nothing
to
see
and
thence
to
the
upper
deck
here
near
the
mainmast
were
two
pumps
of
the
pattern
i
recollected
noticing
in
a
ship
that
had
been
built
in
and
that
was
afloat
and
hearty
and
earning
good
money
in
in
front
of
the
mast
lay
two
boats
one
within
the
other
the
under
one
on
chocks
both
of
the
same
pattern
namely
square
stern
and
stem
with
lengths
of
the
gunwales
projecting
like
horns
the
top
one
for
i
could
not
see
the
inside
of
the
lower
boat
had
been
painted
originally
a
bright
scarlet
she
contained
seats
and
of
oars
short
and
long
all
with
immensely
broad
blades
which
had
also
been
painted
a
bright
red
the
rusty
guns
the
ends
of
gear
snaking
in
the
froth
along
the
scuppers
the
cumbersomeness
of
the
blocks
of
the
maintack
along
with
the
other
furniture
of
that
groaning
and
sail
the
grey
old
cask
answering
for
a
scuttlebutt
lashed
to
the
larboard
side
the
ancientness
of
the
tarpauling
over
the
great
hatch
these
and
a
score
of
other
details
it
would
tease
you
to
hear
me
name
gave
a
most
dismal
and
wretched
appearance
to
all
this
part
of
the
tossed
drenched
fabric
labouring
under
a
sky
that
had
darkened
since
the
morning
and
against
whose
complexion
the
edges
of
the
sails
showed
with
a
raw
and
sickly
pallor
whilst
above
swung
the
great
barricaded
tops
and
the
masts
and
yards
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
how
drearily
and
wearily
the
bulwarks
being
very
high
enabled
me
to
dodge
the
seas
as
i
crept
forwards
and
presently
i
came
abreast
of
the
foremast
where
stood
jans
the
boatswain
along
with
three
or
four
seamen
taking
the
shelter
of
a
sort
of
hutch
built
very
strong
whence
proceeded
sounds
of
the
grunting
of
hogs
and
the
muttering
of
geese
hens
and
the
like
as
i
needed
an
excuse
to
be
here
for
these
fellows
believed
the
time
to
be
that
of
cromwell
and
blake
and
looked
upon
an
englishman
as
an
enemy
and
therefore
might
round
upon
me
angrily
for
offering
to
overhaul
their
ship
i
said
to
jans
in
my
civillest
manner
are
the
men
who
rescued
me
last
night
here
i
shall
be
glad
to
thank
them
yonder
houtmann
said
he
bluntly
the
other
below
i
turned
to
the
man
named
houtmann
and
saw
in
him
an
old
sailor
of
perhaps
with
a
drooped
head
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
worn
wrinkled
melancholy
face
his
complexion
like
that
of
the
others
of
the
grave
he
was
dressed
in
boots
loose
yellow
tarpaulin
trousers
and
a
frock
of
the
same
material
he
had
a
on
a
good
cap
such
as
i
myself
wore
aboard
the
saracen
and
there
was
a
stout
shawl
around
his
neck
i
put
out
my
hand
and
said
houtmann
let
an
english
sailor
thank
a
brave
hollander
of
his
own
calling
for
his
life
he
did
not
smile
showed
himself
by
not
so
much
as
a
twitch
in
his
face
sensible
of
my
speech
save
that
in
the
most
lifeless
manner
in
the
world
he
held
out
his
hand
which
i
took
but
i
was
glad
to
let
it
fall
if
ever
a
hand
had
the
chill
of
death
to
freeze
mortal
flesh
his
had
that
coldness
no
other
man
skin
in
that
ship
had
i
before
touched
though
my
arm
had
been
seized
by
vanderdecken
and
this
contact
makes
one
of
the
most
biting
memories
of
that
time
will
you
suppose
that
the
coldness
was
produced
by
the
wet
and
the
wind
alas
he
withdrew
his
hand
from
his
pocket
but
even
had
he
raised
it
from
a
block
of
ice
you
would
not
in
the
bitter
bleakness
of
the
flesh
have
felt
as
i
did
the
death
in
his
veins
had
he
been
as
i
was
the
others
were
variously
attired
in
such
clothes
as
you
would
conceive
a
ship
would
be
fitted
with
from
pickings
of
vessels
encountered
and
ransacked
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
they
had
all
of
them
a
dutch
cast
of
countenance
one
looking
not
more
than
thirty
another
forty
and
so
on
but
there
was
something
in
them
though
god
knows
if
my
life
were
the
stake
i
should
not
be
able
to
define
it
that
backed
by
the
movements
complexions
and
the
like
made
you
see
that
with
them
time
had
become
eternity
and
that
their
exteriors
were
no
more
significant
of
the
years
they
could
count
than
the
effigy
on
the
tomb
of
a
man
represents
the
dust
of
him
it
blows
hard
said
i
to
jans
making
the
most
of
my
stock
of
dutch
and
resolved
to
confront
each
amazing
experience
as
it
befel
me
with
a
bold
face
but
the
braave
is
a
stout
ship
and
makes
excellent
weather
so
think
the
rats
exclaimed
houtmann
addressing
jans
a
plague
on
the
rats
cried
jans
there
but
one
remedy
when
we
get
to
table
bay
the
hold
must
be
smoked
with
sulphur
i
never
knew
rats
multiply
as
they
do
in
this
ship
said
one
of
the
sailors
named
kryns
had
we
been
ten
years
making
the
passage
from
batavia
the
vermin
could
not
have
increased
more
rapidly
where
do
the
crew
sleep
said
jans
pointed
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
to
a
hatch
abreast
of
the
of
the
forecastle
bulwark
the
cover
was
over
it
for
there
the
spray
was
constantly
shooting
up
like
steam
from
boiling
water
and
filling
the
hollow
of
the
foresail
with
wet
which
showered
from
under
the
arched
in
whole
thunderstorms
of
rain
otherwise
i
should
have
asked
leave
to
go
below
and
explore
the
forecastle
for
no
part
of
this
ship
could
i
thought
be
more
curious
than
the
place
in
which
her
crew
lived
and
i
particularly
desired
to
see
how
they
slept
nay
to
see
them
sleeping
and
to
observe
the
character
of
their
beds
whether
hammocks
or
bunks
and
their
chests
or
bags
for
their
clothes
i
said
it
will
be
dark
enough
down
there
with
the
hatch
closed
ay
said
the
of
the
seamen
named
abraham
bothma
i
took
down
their
names
afterwards
from
imogene
dictation
conceiving
that
the
mentioning
of
them
would
prove
of
interest
to
any
descendants
of
theirs
in
holland
into
whose
hands
this
narrative
might
chance
to
fall
but
we
keep
a
lamp
always
burning
but
should
you
run
short
of
oil
said
i
timorously
for
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
pretend
to
one
and
all
that
i
believed
they
had
sailed
from
batavia
in
the
preceding
year
and
the
question
was
a
departure
from
that
resolution
oil
is
easily
got
exclaimed
jans
roughly
what
use
do
you
english
make
of
the
porpoise
and
the
grampus
is
not
the
seabird
full
of
it
and
fish
you
in
any
bay
along
the
coast
natal
and
cape
town
and
i
warrant
you
livers
enough
to
keep
your
lamps
burning
for
a
voyage
round
the
world
and
what
ship
with
coppers
aboard
can
be
wanting
in
slush
heer
jans
said
i
i
am
a
sailor
and
love
to
hear
the
opinions
of
persons
of
my
own
calling
therefore
i
would
ask
you
do
not
you
consider
your
ship
greatly
hampered
forward
by
yonder
and
the
heavy
yards
there
and
to
render
myself
perfectly
intelligible
i
pointed
to
the
mast
that
i
have
already
described
as
being
fixed
upright
at
the
end
of
the
bowsprit
rising
so
to
speak
out
of
a
round
top
there
and
having
a
smaller
top
on
the
upper
end
of
it
how
would
you
have
her
rigged
asked
he
in
a
sneering
manner
why
said
i
cautiously
as
most
of
the
ships
you
meet
are
rigged
with
a
jibboom
upon
which
you
can
set
more
useful
canvas
than
spritsails
on
this
bothma
said
let
your
country
rig
its
ships
as
it
chooses
they
will
find
the
dutch
know
more
about
the
sea
and
the
art
of
navigating
and
commanding
it
than
your
nation
has
stomach
for
i
could
have
smiled
at
this
but
the
voice
of
the
man
the
deadness
of
his
face
the
terrifying
life
in
his
eyes
the
sombre
gravity
of
the
others
standing
about
me
like
people
in
their
sleep
were
such
a
corrective
of
humour
as
might
have
made
a
braver
man
than
i
am
tremble
i
dared
not
go
on
talking
with
them
indeed
their
looks
caused
me
to
fear
for
my
senses
so
without
further
ado
i
walked
aft
and
entered
the
cabin
hoping
to
find
warmth
and
recovery
for
my
mind
in
the
beauty
and
conversation
of
imogene
the
cabin
was
deserted
the
darkness
of
the
sky
made
it
very
gloomy
and
what
with
its
meagre
furniture
the
unhealthy
colouring
of
its
walls
trappings
of
gilt
and
handwork
once
i
daresay
very
brilliant
and
delightful
but
now
as
rueful
as
a
harlequin
faded
dress
seen
by
the
sun
it
was
a
most
depressing
interior
particularly
in
such
weather
as
was
then
storming
when
the
ceaseless
thunder
of
bursting
surges
drove
shock
after
shock
of
tempestuous
sound
through
the
resonant
fabric
and
when
the
shrieking
of
the
wind
not
only
in
the
rigging
but
along
the
floor
of
the
stormy
sky
itself
was
like
the
frantic
of
demons
to
the
million
hounds
of
the
blast
not
knowing
how
to
pass
the
time
i
went
to
the
old
framed
pictures
upon
the
sides
and
found
them
to
be
panels
fitted
to
the
plank
and
framed
so
as
to
form
as
much
a
part
of
the
structure
as
the
carving
on
her
stern
would
be
but
time
neglect
dirt
or
damp
one
or
all
had
so
befouled
or
darkened
the
surfaces
that
most
of
them
were
more
like
the
heads
of
tar
barrels
than
paintings
yet
here
and
there
i
managed
to
witness
a
glimmering
survival
of
the
artist
work
one
representing
the
fish
market
at
amsterdam
such
of
the
figures
as
were
plain
exhibiting
plenty
of
humour
another
a
dutch
east
indiaman
of
vanderdecken
period
sailing
along
with
canvas
full
streamers
blowing
and
the
batavian
colours
standing
out
large
from
the
ensign
staff
a
third
was
a
portrait
but
nothing
was
left
of
it
save
a
nose
whose
ruddy
tip
time
had
evidently
fallen
in
love
with
for
there
it
still
glowed
a
mouth
widely
distended
with
laughter
and
one
merry
little
eye
the
other
having
sunk
like
a
star
in
the
dark
cloud
that
overspread
most
of
this
panel
this
i
supposed
had
been
the
portrait
of
a
sailor
for
so
much
of
the
remainder
as
was
determinable
all
related
to
amsterdam
and
things
nautical
having
made
this
dismal
round
i
sat
me
down
at
the
table
sternly
and
closely
watched
by
the
parrot
whose
distressing
croaking
assurance
i
had
no
wish
to
hear
she
being
my
only
company
if
i
except
the
clock
whose
hoarse
ticking
was
audible
above
the
gale
and
the
skeleton
skulking
inside
whose
hourly
resurrection
i
was
now
in
the
temper
to
as
greatly
dislike
as
the
bird
iterative
denunciation
i
wondered
how
the
young
lady
contrived
to
pass
her
time
had
she
books
if
so
they
would
doubtless
be
dull
performances
in
old
dutch
fat
and
wormy
volumes
bound
in
hard
leather
as
sluggish
in
their
matter
as
a
canal
and
very
little
calculated
to
amuse
a
spirited
girl
evidently
in
the
five
years
she
had
been
sailing
with
vanderdecken
she
had
learnt
what
she
knew
of
dutch
she
spoke
fluently
and
with
a
good
accent
though
to
be
sure
it
was
the
dutch
of
i
constantly
directed
my
eyes
towards
her
cabin
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
emerge
for
i
felt
mighty
dull
and
sad
and
longed
for
the
sight
of
her
fair
and
golden
beauty
and
all
the
while
i
was
wondering
how
she
had
endured
without
losing
her
mind
the
dreadful
imprisonment
she
had
undergone
and
was
yet
undergoing
and
the
still
more
fearful
association
of
the
captain
and
his
men
i
also
employed
myself
in
turning
over
several
schemes
for
escaping
with
her
but
nothing
that
was
really
practicable
offered
suppose
we
met
with
an
unsuspecting
ship
i
mean
a
vessel
that
did
not
know
we
were
the
craft
that
has
been
called
the
flying
dutchman
vanderdecken
being
willing
to
get
rid
of
me
sends
me
to
her
in
a
boat
i
cry
out
that
there
is
a
young
lady
left
behind
breaking
her
heart
for
home
whereupon
explanations
would
follow
to
prove
the
vessel
the
death
ship
what
would
happen
in
all
probability
if
i
had
managed
to
board
the
vessel
we
met
her
crew
to
preserve
her
from
the
curse
would
fling
me
overboard
in
any
case
away
they
would
run
directly
the
truth
was
known
indeed
acquainted
as
i
was
with
the
terror
with
which
vanderdecken
was
viewed
by
all
classes
of
mariners
was
positive
that
though
he
had
no
suspicion
himself
of
the
dread
he
inspired
the
story
that
would
have
to
be
told
concerning
miss
dudley
to
account
for
her
detention
in
the
phantom
ship
would
end
in
resolving
those
we
encountered
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
either
her
or
me
but
to
bear
a
hand
and
up
sticks
as
to
getting
away
with
her
in
one
of
the
dutchman
boats
first
how
was
i
to
hoist
the
boat
over
the
side
unperceived
next
suppose
that
was
to
be
managed
then
on
his
missing
us
would
not
vanderdecken
a
man
of
fierce
resolution
hunt
after
and
perhaps
find
us
when
i
should
be
at
the
mercy
of
one
in
whom
there
was
a
great
deal
of
the
devil
and
who
heaven
knows
could
not
revenge
himself
more
awfully
than
by
keeping
me
in
his
ship
several
projects
i
thought
of
and
then
a
strange
idea
came
into
my
head
here
was
a
girl
without
mother
or
father
and
as
i
gathered
entirely
friendless
and
penniless
as
indeed
in
this
latter
article
she
could
hardly
help
being
as
the
child
of
a
sailor
suppose
i
should
succeed
in
escaping
with
her
how
could
an
association
such
as
ours
end
but
in
a
wedding
and
did
that
consideration
agitate
me
faith
though
i
had
only
known
her
since
this
morning
i
reckoned
being
young
and
in
an
especial
degree
an
admirer
and
lover
of
the
kind
of
beauty
and
sweetness
this
girl
had
in
perfection
it
would
not
need
many
days
to
pass
before
my
heart
would
be
hers
forthwith
my
imagination
grew
sunny
many
bright
and
delightful
ideas
occurred
to
me
would
not
my
tremendous
experience
find
a
glorious
crowning
in
the
hand
of
this
girl
and
her
endowment
by
vanderdecken
who
loved
her
out
of
those
chests
of
treasure
and
coin
which
he
had
in
his
hold
would
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
persuade
him
say
after
the
next
gale
which
blew
him
back
from
agulhas
to
put
us
aboard
some
vessel
homeward
bound
along
with
a
chest
of
treasure
for
his
wife
as
an
earnest
of
what
was
coming
and
so
enable
me
to
convey
miss
dudley
straight
to
amsterdam
there
to
await
his
arrival
it
was
but
a
young
man
fancy
pretentious
and
inconsistent
with
my
opinion
of
the
captain
temper
and
his
ignorance
of
the
curse
that
lay
on
him
and
it
was
not
perhaps
strictly
honest
though
if
you
come
to
consider
that
his
doom
would
never
suffer
him
to
use
the
riches
he
had
in
his
ship
nor
to
know
whether
i
had
faithfully
carried
miss
dudley
to
his
house
on
the
buitenkant
where
i
afterwards
heard
he
was
living
when
he
sailed
you
will
not
judge
me
harshly

idly
and
merrily

when
