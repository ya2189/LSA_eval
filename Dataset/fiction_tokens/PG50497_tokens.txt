i
the
end
of
the
adventure
i
it
is
hard
to
recapture
the
spirit
of
that
day
we
entered
lille
other
things
since
have
blurred
its
fine
images
at
the
time
i
tried
to
put
down
in
words
the
picture
of
that
scene
when
after
four
slaughter
of
men
the
city
which
had
seemed
a
world
away
was
open
to
us
a
few
miles
beyond
the
the
riven
trees
the
and
the
stench
of
death
and
we
walked
across
the
canal
over
a
broken
bridge
into
that
large
town
where
how
wonderful
it
seemed
i
there
were
roofs
on
the
houses
and
glass
in
the
windows
and
crowds
of
civilian
people
waiting
for
the
first
glimpse
of
british
khaki
even
now
remembrance
brings
back
to
me
figures
that
i
saw
only
for
a
moment
or
two
but
remain
sharply
etched
in
my
mind
and
people
i
met
in
the
streets
who
told
me
the
story
of
four
years
in
less
than
four
minutes
and
enough
to
let
me
know
their
bitterness
hatred
humiliations
terrors
in
the
time
of
the
german
occupation
i
have
the
words
i
wrote
hastily
on
a
truculent
typewriter
which
i
cursed
for
its
twisted
ribbon
while
the
vision
of
the
day
was
in
my
eyes
they
are
true
to
the
facts
and
to
what
we
felt
about
them
other
men
felt
that
sense
of
exaltation
a
kind
of
mystical
union
with
the
spirit
of
many
people
who
had
been
delivered
from
evil
powers
it
is
of
those
other
men
that
i
am
now
writing
and
especially
of
one
who
was
my
friend
wickham
brand
with
the
troubled
soul
whom
i
knew
in
the
years
of
war
and
afterwards
in
the
peace
which
was
no
peace
to
him
his
was
one
of
the
faces
i
remember
that
day
as
i
had
a
glimpse
of
it
now
and
then
among
crowds
of
men
and
women
young
girls
and
children
who
surged
about
him
kissing
his
hands
and
his
face
when
he
stooped
a
little
he
was
taller
than
most
of
them
to
meet
the
wet
lips
of
some
baby
held
up
by
a
pallid
woman
of
lille
or
to
receive
the
kiss
of
some
old
woman
who
clawed
his
khaki
tunic
or
of
some
girl
who
hung
on
to
his
belt
there
was
a
shining
wetness
in
his
eyes
and
the
hard
lines
of
his
face
had
softened
as
he
laughed
at
all
this
turmoil
about
him
at
all
these
hands
robbing
him
of
and
badges
and
at
all
these
people
telling
him
a
hundred
things
together
their
gratitude
to
the
english
their
hatred
of
the
germans
their
abominable
memories
his
was
pushed
back
from
his
high
furrowed
forehead
from
which
at
the
temples
the
hair
had
worn
thin
owing
to
worry
or
a
steel
hat
his
long
lean
face
deeply
tanned
but
powdered
with
white
dust
had
an
expression
of
tenderness
which
gave
him
a
kind
of
priestly
look
though
others
would
have
said
with
perhaps
equal
truth
anyhow
i
could
see
that
for
a
little
while
brand
was
no
longer
worrying
about
the
casualty
lists
and
the
doom
of
youth
and
was
giving
himself
up
to
an
exaltation
that
was
visible
and
spiritual
in
lille
in
the
day
of
liberation
the
few
of
us
who
went
first
into
lille
while
our
troops
were
in
a
wide
are
round
the
city
in
touch
more
or
less
with
the
german
rearguards
were
quickly
separated
in
the
swirl
of
the
crowd
that
surged
about
us
greeting
us
as
conquering
heroes
though
none
of
us
were
actual
fighting
men
being
war
correspondents
intelligence
officers
wickham
brand
and
three
other
officers
were
there
to
establish
an
advanced
headquarters
with
an
american
doctor
that
amazing
fellow
small
and
our
french
officer
pierre
nesle
now
and
again
we
met
in
the
streets
and
exchanged
words
i
remember
the
doctor
and
i
drifted
together
at
the
end
of
the
boulevard
de
la
liberté
a
french
girl
of
the
had
tucked
her
hand
through
his
right
arm
and
was
talking
to
him
excitedly
volubly
on
his
other
arm
leaned
an
old
dame
in
a
black
dress
and
bonnet
who
was
also
delivering
her
soul
of
its
emotion
to
a
man
who
did
not
understand
more
than
a
few
words
of
her
french
a
small
boy
dressed
as
a
zouave
was
walking
backwards
waving
a
long
tricolour
flag
before
the
little
american
and
a
crowd
of
people
made
a
close
circle
about
him
keeping
pace
bandits
robbers
gobbled
the
old
woman
stole
all
our
copper
monsieur
the
very
mattresses
off
our
beds
the
wine
out
of
our
cellars
they
did
after
month
we
waited
said
the
girl
with
her
hand
through
the
right
arm
that
time
the
noise
of
the
guns
was
loud
in
our
ears
it
never
ceased
monsieur
until
and
we
used
to
say
the
english
will
come
until
at
last
some
of
us
lost
heart
not
i
no
always
i
believed
in
victory
and
said
english
will
never
come
now
you
are
here
and
our
hearts
are
full
of
joy
it
is
like
a
dream
the
germans
have
gone
the
doctor
patted
the
hand
and
addressed
me
across
the
tricolour
waved
by
the
small
zouave
is
the
greatest
day
of
my
life
and
i
am
perfectly
ashamed
of
myself
in
spite
of
my
beard
and
my
and
my
anarchical
appearance
these
dear
people
take
me
for
an
english
officer
and
a
fighting
hero
and
i
feel
like
one
if
i
saw
a
german
now
i
truly
believe
i
should
cut
his
throat
me
a
and
a
man
of
peace
horrified
at
my
own
the
worst
of
it
is
enjoying
it
a
primitive
man
for
a
time
and
find
it
stimulating
i
shall
repent
these
people
have
suffered
torments
i
understand
a
word
the
little
old
lady
is
telling
me
but
sure
been
through
infernal
things
and
this
pretty
girl
a
peach
though
slightly
tuberculous
poor
child
my
god
how
they
hate
there
is
a
hatred
in
this
town
enough
to
burn
up
germany
by
mental
telepathy
frightening
hatred
and
joy
i
feel
these
two
passions
like
a
flame
about
us
spiritual
transcendental
the
first
time
seen
a
hundred
thousand
people
drunk
with
joy
and
hate
against
hate
and
yet
the
sufferings
of
these
people
make
me
see
red
so
that
i
want
to
cut
a
german
throat
stitch
it
up
afterwards
doctor
i
said
he
blinked
at
me
through
his
spectacles
and
said
hope
so
i
hope
my
instinct
would
be
as
right
as
that
the
world
will
never
get
forward
till
we
have
killed
hatred
my
assassins
grumbled
the
old
lady
people
les
anglais
shouted
the
crowd
surging
about
the
little
man
with
the
beard
the
american
doctor
spoke
in
english
in
a
large
explanatory
way
american
you
go
making
any
mistake
an
uncle
sam
the
yankee
boys
are
further
south
and
fighting
like
hell
poor
lads
i
deserve
any
of
this
ovation
my
then
in
french
with
a
strong
american
accent
he
shouted
la
france
merci
mon
général
said
an
old
woman
making
a
grab
at
the
little
sam
brown
belt
and
kissing
him
on
the
beard
the
crowd
closed
round
him
and
bore
him
away
i
met
another
of
our
crowd
when
i
went
to
a
house
in
a
turning
off
the
rue
royale
pierre
nesle
our
officer
a
nice
simple
fellow
who
had
always
been
very
civil
to
me
was
talking
to
the
priest
outside
his
door
and
introduced
me
in
a
formal
way
to
a
tall
old
man
in
a
long
black
gown
it
was
the
abbé
bourdin
well
known
in
lille
as
a
good
priest
and
a
patriot
indoors
gentlemen
said
the
old
man
will
tell
you
what
happened
to
us
though
it
would
take
four
years
to
tell
you
sitting
there
in
the
room
barely
furnished
with
a
few
oak
chairs
and
a
littered
with
papers
and
a
table
covered
with
a
tattered
cloth
of
red
plush
we
listened
to
a
tragic
tale
told
finely
and
with
emotion
by
the
old
man
into
whose
soul
it
had
burned
it
was
the
history
of
a
great
population
caught
by
the
tide
of
war
before
many
could
escape
and
placed
under
the
military
law
of
an
enemy
who
tried
to
break
its
spirit
they
failed
to
break
it
in
spite
of
an
iron
discipline
which
denied
them
all
liberty
for
any
trivial
offence
by
individuals
against
german
rule
the
whole
population
was
fined
or
shut
up
in
their
houses
at
three
in
the
afternoon
there
were
endless
fines
unceasing
and
intolerable
robberies
under
the
name
of
that
had
not
broken
the
spirit
there
were
worse
things
to
bear
the
removal
of
machinery
from
the
factories
the
taking
away
of
the
young
men
and
boys
for
forced
labour
and
then
the
greater
infancy
of
that
night
when
were
placed
at
the
street
corners
and
german
officers
ordered
each
household
to
assemble
at
the
front
door
and
chose
the
girls
by
the
pointing
of
a
stick
and
the
word
you
for
it
was
that
in
unknown
fields
far
away
the
face
blanched
at
the
remembrance
of
that
scene
his
voice
quavered
when
he
spoke
of
the
screams
one
of
them
had
gone
raving
mad
and
of
the
wailing
that
rose
among
their
stricken
families
for
a
while
he
was
silent
with
lowered
head
and
brooding
eyes
which
stared
at
a
rent
in
the
threadbare
carpet
and
i
noticed
the
trembling
of
a
pulse
on
his
right
temple
above
the
wrinkles
of
his
parchment
skin
then
he
raised
his
head
and
spoke
harshly
even
that
could
break
the
spirit
of
my
people
they
only
said
will
never
forget
and
never
forgive
they
were
hungry
we
did
not
get
much
food
but
they
said
sons
who
are
fighting
for
us
are
suffering
worse
things
it
is
for
us
to
be
they
were
surrounded
by
german
spies
the
secret
police
who
listened
to
their
words
and
haled
them
off
to
prison
upon
any
pretext
there
is
hardly
a
man
among
us
who
has
not
been
in
prison
the
women
were
made
to
do
filthy
work
for
german
soldiers
to
wash
their
lousy
clothes
to
scrub
their
dirty
barracks
and
they
were
insulted
humiliated
tempted
by
brutal
there
much
of
that
brutality
i
asked
the
eyes
grew
sombre
women
suffered
abominable
things
i
thank
god
that
so
many
kept
their
pride
and
their
honour
there
were
no
doubt
some
bad
men
and
women
in
the
city
disloyal
venal
weak
sinful
may
god
have
mercy
on
their
souls
but
i
am
proud
of
being
a
frenchman
when
i
think
of
how
great
was
the
courage
how
patient
was
the
suffering
of
the
people
of
pierre
nesle
had
listened
to
that
monologue
with
a
visible
and
painful
emotion
he
became
pale
and
flushed
by
turns
and
when
the
priest
spoke
about
the
forcible
recruitment
of
the
women
a
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
and
he
wiped
it
away
with
a
handkerchief
i
see
his
face
now
in
profile
sharply
outlined
against
some
yellowing
folios
in
a
bookcase
behind
him
a
typical
parisian
face
in
its
sharpness
of
outline
and
pallid
skin
with
a
little
black
moustache
above
a
thin
sensitive
mouth
before
i
had
seen
him
mostly
in
gay
moods
though
i
had
wondered
sometimes
at
the
sudden
silences
into
which
he
fell
and
at
a
gloom
which
gave
him
a
melancholy
look
when
he
was
not
talking
or
singing
or
reciting
poetry
or
railing
against
french
politicians
or
laughing
almost
hysterically
at
the
satires
of
charles
fortune
our
when
he
came
to
our
mess
now
he
was
suffering
as
if
the
words
had
probed
a
wound
though
not
the
physical
wound
which
had
nearly
killed
him
in
souchez
wood
he
stood
up
from
the
wooden
chair
with
its
arms
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
stiffly
and
spoke
to
the
priest
is
not
amusing
what
you
tell
us
and
what
we
have
all
guessed
it
is
one
more
chapter
of
tragedy
in
the
history
of
our
poor
france
pray
god
the
war
will
soon
be
victory
said
the
old
priest
an
enemy
beaten
and
bleeding
beneath
our
feet
the
germans
must
be
punished
for
all
their
crimes
or
the
justice
of
god
will
not
be
there
was
a
thrill
of
passion
in
the
old
voice
and
his
nostrils
quivered
all
frenchmen
that
goes
without
saying
said
pierre
nesle
germans
must
be
punished
and
will
be
though
no
vengeance
will
repay
us
for
the
suffering
of
our
nor
for
the
agony
of
our
women
behind
the
lines
which
perhaps
was
the
greatest
of
the
abbé
bourdin
put
his
old
hands
on
the
young
shoulders
and
drew
him
closer
and
kissed
his
croix
de
guerre
have
helped
to
give
victory
he
said
many
germans
have
you
killed
how
many
eh
he
spoke
eagerly
chuckling
with
a
kind
of
childish
eagerness
for
good
news
pierre
nesle
drew
back
a
little
and
a
faint
touch
of
colour
crept
into
his
face
and
then
left
it
whiter
did
not
count
corpses
he
said
he
touched
his
left
side
and
laughed
awkwardly
remember
better
that
they
nearly
made
a
corpse
of
there
was
a
silence
and
then
my
friend
spoke
in
a
casual
kind
of
way
suppose
you
have
not
heard
of
my
sister
being
in
lille
by
any
chance
her
name
was
marthe
marthe
the
abbé
bourdin
shook
his
head
do
not
know
the
name
there
are
many
young
women
in
lille
it
is
a
great
is
true
said
pierre
nesle
are
he
bowed
over
the
hand
and
then
saluted
jour
mon
père
et
merci
mille
so
we
left
and
the
abbé
bourdin
spoke
his
last
words
to
me
owe
our
liberation
to
the
english
we
thank
you
but
why
did
you
not
come
sooner
two
years
sooner
three
years
with
your
great
army
of
our
men
died
to
get
here
i
said
is
true
that
is
true
you
failed
many
times
i
know
but
you
were
so
close
one
big
push
eh
one
mighty
effort
no
the
priest
spoke
a
thought
which
i
had
heard
expressed
in
the
crowds
they
were
grateful
for
our
coming
immensely
glad
but
could
not
understand
why
we
had
tried
their
patience
so
many
years
that
had
been
their
greatest
misery
waiting
waiting
i
spoke
to
pierre
nesle
on
the
doorstep
of
the
house
you
an
idea
that
your
sister
is
in
lille
he
said
at
least
not
more
than
the
faintest
hope
she
is
behind
the
lines
somewhere
anywhere
she
went
away
from
home
before
the
war
she
was
a
singer
and
was
caught
in
the
news
at
all
i
asked
last
letter
was
from
lille
or
rather
a
postcard
with
the
lille
stamp
she
said
i
am
amusing
myself
well
little
she
and
i
were
good
comrades
i
look
for
her
face
in
the
crowds
but
she
may
be
anywhere
valenciennes
maubeuge
god
knows
a
shout
of
la
france
rose
from
a
crowd
of
people
surging
up
the
street
pierre
nesle
was
in
the
blue
uniform
of
the
à
and
the
people
in
lille
guessed
it
was
theirs
because
of
its
contrast
to
our
khaki
though
the
was
so
different
from
the
uniforms
worn
by
the
french
army
of
to
them
now
on
the
day
of
liberation
pierre
nesle
our
little
officer
stood
for
the
armies
of
france
the
glory
of
france
even
the
sight
of
our
khaki
did
not
fill
them
with
such
wild
enthusiasm
so
i
lost
him
again
as
i
had
lost
the
little
american
doctor
in
the
surge
and
whirlpool
of
the
crowd
ii
i
was
building
up
in
my
mind
the
historic
meaning
of
the
day
before
nightfall
i
should
have
to
get
it
written
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
facts
if
i
could
in
time
for
the
censors
and
the
the
facts
by
many
scraps
of
conversation
with
men
and
women
in
the
streets
i
could
already
reconstruct
pretty
well
the
life
of
lille
in
time
of
war
i
found
many
of
their
complaints
rather
trivial
the
germans
had
wanted
brass
and
had
taken
it
down
to
the
taps
in
the
well
i
had
seen
worse
horrors
than
that
they
had
wanted
wool
and
had
taken
the
mattresses
they
had
requisitioned
all
the
wine
but
had
paid
for
it
at
cheap
rates
these
were
not
atrocities
the
people
of
lille
had
been
short
of
food
sometimes
on
the
verge
of
starvation
but
not
really
starved
they
complained
of
having
gone
without
butter
milk
sugar
but
even
in
england
these
things
were
hard
to
get
no
the
tragedy
of
lille
lay
deeper
than
that
a
sense
of
fear
that
was
always
with
them
time
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
said
one
man
started
up
in
alarm
it
was
a
knock
at
our
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
they
were
subject
to
visits
from
german
police
to
searches
arrests
or
orders
to
get
out
of
their
houses
or
rooms
for
german
officers
or
troops
they
were
denounced
by
spies
germans
or
debased
people
of
their
own
city
for
trying
to
smuggle
letters
to
their
folk
in
other
towns
in
enemy
occupation
for
concealing
copper
in
for
words
of
contempt
against
the
kaiser
or
the
kommandatur
spoken
at
a
street
corner
between
one
friend
and
another
that
consciousness
of
being
watched
overheard
reported
and
denounced
poisoned
the
very
atmosphere
of
their
lives
and
the
sight
of
the
men
in
the
streets
the
stench
of
them
the
smell
was
horrible
when
german
troops
marched
back
from
the
battlefields
produced
a
worse
than
physical
nausea
i
could
understand
the
constant
fret
at
the
nerves
of
these
people
the
nagging
humiliation
they
had
to
doff
hats
to
every
german
officer
who
swaggered
by
and
the
passion
of
people
proud
by
virtue
of
their
race
who
found
themselves
controlled
ordered
about
bullied
punished
for
trivial
infractions
of
military
regulations
by
german
officials
of
hard
unbending
arrogance
that
must
have
been
abominable
for
so
long
a
time
but
as
yet
i
heard
no
charges
of
definite
brutality
or
of
atrocious
actions
by
individual
enemies
the
worst
i
had
heard
was
that
levy
of
the
women
for
forced
labour
in
unknown
places
one
could
imagine
the
horror
of
it
the
cruelty
of
it
to
girls
whose
nerves
were
already
unstrung
by
secret
fears
dark
and
horrible
imaginings
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
men
who
passed
them
in
the
streets
then
the
hope
of
liberation
year
after
year
the
german
boasts
of
victory
the
strength
of
the
german
defence
that
never
seemed
to
weaken
in
spite
of
the
desperate
attacks
of
french
and
british
the
preliminary
success
of
their
great
offensive
in
march
and
april
when
masses
of
english
prisoners
were
herded
through
lille
dejected
exhausted
hardly
able
to
drag
their
feet
along
between
their
sullen
guards
by
heaven
these
people
of
lille
had
needed
much
faith
to
save
them
from
despair
no
wonder
now
that
on
the
first
day
of
liberation
some
of
them
were
with
joy
and
others
were
lightheaded
with
liberty
in
the
grande
place
below
the
old
balustraded
town
hall
i
saw
young
cyril
clatworthy
one
of
the
intelligence
crowd
surrounded
by
a
group
of
girls
who
were
stroking
his
tunic
clasping
his
hands
pushing
each
other
laughingly
to
get
nearer
to
him
he
was
in
lively
conversation
with
the
prettiest
girl
whom
he
kept
in
front
of
him
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
enjoying
himself
as
the
central
figure
of
this
and
as
i
passed
the
boy
that
birthday
he
had
told
me
a
month
before
i
marvelled
at
his
ceaseless
capacity
for
amorous
adventure
with
or
without
a
notice
a
pretty
girl
if
possible
or
a
plain
one
if
not
drew
him
like
a
magnet
excited
all
his
boyish
egotism
called
to
the
that
played
the
pipes
of
pan
in
his
heart
it
was
an
amusing
game
for
him
with
his
curly
brown
hair
and
midshipman
easy
type
of
face
for
the
french
girls
whom
he
had
met
on
his
way
little
marcelle
on
cassel
hill
christine
at
corbie
on
the
somme
marguérite
in
the
at
amiens
what
became
of
her
poor
kid
it
was
not
so
amusing
when
he
away
as
he
called
it
and
had
a
look
at
life
elsewhere
he
winked
at
me
as
i
passed
over
the
heads
of
the
girls
fruits
of
victory
he
called
out
is
a
little
miss
here
who
is
quite
it
was
rather
caddish
of
me
to
say
you
forgotten
marguérite
aubigny
he
thought
so
too
and
reddened
angrily
to
blazes
he
said
his
greatest
chum
and
one
of
mine
charles
fortune
was
standing
outside
a
in
the
big
place
not
far
from
the
vieille
bourse
with
its
renaissance
front
here
there
was
a
dense
crowd
but
they
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
from
fortune
who
with
his
red
tabs
and
and
row
of
ribbons
all
gained
by
heroic
service
over
a
in
a
nissen
hut
looked
to
them
no
doubt
like
a
great
general
he
had
his
face
on
rather
mystical
and
saintly
he
had
a
variety
of
faces
for
divers
occasions
such
as
the
in
the
presence
of
generals
who
disliked
brilliant
men
the
and
inquiring
for
senior
officers
who
liked
easy
questions
to
which
they
could
give
portentous
answers
the
face
for
the
benefit
of
military
chaplains
foreign
visitors
to
the
and
batmen
before
they
discovered
his
sense
of
humour
and
the
face
at
times
for
young
harding
who
belonged
to
a
county
family
with
all
its
traditions
politics
and
instincts
and
permitted
fortune
to
pull
his
leg
to
criticise
generals
and
denounce
the
british
empire
as
a
licensed
jester
fortune
was
addressing
four
gentlemen
of
the
town
council
of
lille
who
stood
before
him
holding
ancient
said
charles
fortune
in
deliberate
french
with
an
exaggerated
accent
appreciate
very
much
the
honour
you
have
just
paid
me
by
singing
that
heroic
old
song
a
long
long
way
to
i
desire
however
to
explain
to
you
that
it
is
not
as
yet
the
national
anthem
of
the
british
people
and
that
personally
i
have
never
been
to
tipperary
that
i
should
find
some
difficulty
in
finding
that
place
on
the
map
and
that
i
never
want
to
go
there
this
however
is
of
small
importance
except
to
british
generals
to
whom
all
small
things
are
of
great
importance
revealing
therefore
their
minute
attention
to
details
even
when
it
does
not
matter
which
i
may
say
is
the
true
test
of
the
military
mind
which
is
so
gloriously
winning
the
war
after
many
glorious
defeats
i
mean
victories
and
here
fortune
became
rather
tangled
in
his
french
grammar
but
rescued
himself
after
a
still
more
heroic
look
it
is
with
the
deepest
satisfaction
the
most
profound
emotion
that
i
find
myself
in
this
great
city
of
lille
on
the
day
of
liberation
and
on
behalf
of
the
british
army
of
which
i
am
a
humble
representative
in
spite
of
these
ribbons
which
i
wear
on
my
somewhat
expansive
chest
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
with
the
words
france
here
fortune
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
looked
like
a
field
marshal
while
he
waited
for
the
roar
of
cheers
which
greeted
his
words
the
mystical
look
on
his
face
became
intensified
as
he
stood
there
a
fine
heroic
figure
a
trifle
stout
for
lack
of
exercise
until
he
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
girl
in
the
crowd
nearest
to
him
and
gave
her
an
elaborate
wink
as
much
as
to
say
and
i
understand
each
other
my
pretty
one
beneath
this
heroic
pose
i
am
really
the
effect
of
that
wink
was
instantaneous
the
girl
blushed
vividly
and
giggled
while
the
crowd
shouted
with
laughter
numéro
quel
drôle
de
type
said
a
man
by
my
side
only
the
four
gentlemen
of
the
town
hall
who
had
resumed
their
looked
perplexed
at
this
grotesque
contrast
between
the
heroic
speech
it
had
sounded
heroic
and
its
fortune
took
me
by
the
arm
as
i
edged
my
way
close
to
him
dear
fellow
it
was
unbelievable
when
those
four
old
birds
sang
with
bared
heads
i
had
to
stand
at
the
salute
while
they
sang
three
verses
with
tears
in
their
eyes
they
have
been
learning
it
during
four
years
of
war
think
of
that
and
think
of
happening
in
ireland
in
tipperary
now
some
paradox
here
which
contains
all
the
comedy
and
pathos
of
this
war
i
must
think
it
out
i
quite
get
at
it
yet
but
i
feel
it
from
is
not
a
day
for
satire
i
said
is
a
day
for
sentiment
these
people
have
escaped
from
frightful
things
fortune
looked
at
me
with
quizzical
grey
eyes
out
of
his
handsome
face
tu
brute
after
all
our
midnight
talks
our
laughter
at
the
mockery
of
the
gods
our
intellectual
slaughter
of
the
staff
our
tearing
down
of
all
the
pompous
humbug
which
has
bolstered
up
this
silly
old
know
but
we
can
enjoy
the
spirit
of
victory
real
here
we
have
liberated
all
these
you
mean
the
young
tommies
who
lie
dead
the
other
side
of
the
canal
we
come
in
and
get
the
kudos
presently
the
generals
will
come
and
say
did
it
regard
our
glory
fling
down
your
flowers
cheer
us
good
people
before
we
go
to
they
will
not
see
behind
them
the
legions
they
sent
to
slaughter
by
ghastly
blunders
colossal
stupidity
invincible
fortune
broke
into
song
it
was
an
old
anthem
of
his
bill
the
butcher
of
the
he
had
composed
it
after
a
fourth
whisky
on
a
cottage
piano
in
his
nissen
hut
in
crashing
chords
he
had
revealed
the
soul
of
a
general
preparing
a
plan
of
battle
over
the
telephone
it
never
failed
to
make
me
laugh
except
that
day
in
lille
when
it
was
out
of
tune
i
thought
with
the
spirit
about
us
put
the
bitter
taste
out
of
our
mouth
i
said
fortune
made
his
saluted
behind
his
ear
and
said
inch
a
soldier
i
think
iii
it
was
then
we
bumped
straight
into
wickham
brand
who
was
between
a
small
boy
and
girl
holding
his
hands
while
a
tall
girl
of
sixteen
or
so
with
a
yellow
slung
over
her
shoulder
walked
alongside
talking
vivaciously
of
family
experiences
under
german
rule
pierre
nesle
was
on
the
other
side
of
her
spite
of
all
the
fear
we
had
oh
how
frightened
we
were
sometimes
we
used
to
laugh
very
much
made
a
joke
of
everything
it
was
the
only
way
was
wonderfully
brave
except
when
she
thought
that
father
might
have
been
was
your
father
asked
brand
the
french
side
of
the
lines
of
course
he
was
an
officer
in
the
artillery
we
said
to
him
on
august
of
the
first
year
when
he
went
off
to
the
dépôt
at
belfort
we
all
cried
except
father
was
crying
too
but
did
not
wink
away
even
the
tiniest
tear
until
father
had
gone
then
she
broke
down
so
that
we
all
howled
at
the
sight
of
her
even
these
babies
joined
in
they
were
only
babies
news
of
him
asked
brand
a
word
how
could
there
be
perhaps
in
a
few
days
he
will
walk
into
lille
so
would
be
splendid
said
brand
is
his
name
le
commandant
anatole
chéri
brigade
the
girl
spoke
her
name
proudly
i
saw
a
startled
look
come
into
the
eyes
of
pierre
nesle
as
he
heard
the
name
in
english
he
said
to
brand
knew
him
at
verdun
he
was
wickham
brand
drew
a
sharp
breath
and
his
voice
was
husky
when
he
spoke
in
english
too
cruelty
it
all
is
the
girl
with
the
a
tall
young
creature
with
a
delicate
face
and
big
brown
eyes
stared
at
pierre
nesle
and
then
at
wickham
brand
she
asked
an
abrupt
question
of
pierre
my
father
dead
pierre
nesle
stammered
something
he
was
not
sure
he
had
heard
that
the
commandant
chéri
was
wounded
at
verdun
the
girl
understood
perfectly
is
dead
then
will
be
very
she
did
not
cry
there
was
not
even
a
quiver
of
her
lips
she
shook
hands
with
brand
and
said
must
go
and
tell
will
you
come
and
see
us
one
day
pleasure
said
brand
the
girl
laughed
as
she
raised
her
finger
promise
said
brand
solemnly
the
girl
the
small
boy
and
girl
holding
their
heads
close
to
her
waist
father
dead
said
the
small
boy
i
believe
so
said
the
elder
sister
we
get
the
toys
from
paris
said
the
small
girl
am
afraid
not
a
pity
said
the
boy
pierre
nesle
took
a
step
forward
and
saluted
will
go
with
you
if
you
permit
it
mademoiselle
it
is
perhaps
in
a
little
way
my
duty
as
i
met
your
father
in
the
a
thousand
times
said
the
girl
will
be
glad
to
know
all
you
can
tell
she
waved
to
brand
a
merry
we
stood
watching
them
cross
the
grande
place
that
tall
girl
and
the
two
little
ones
and
pierre
fortune
touched
brand
on
the
arm
that
girl
he
said
it
without
a
whimper
i
wonder
if
she
cared
brand
turned
on
him
rather
savagely
of
course
she
cared
but
she
had
expected
it
for
four
years
grown
up
to
the
idea
these
war
children
have
no
illusions
about
the
business
they
know
that
the
odds
are
in
favour
of
he
raised
his
hands
above
his
head
with
a
sudden
passionate
gesture
god
he
said
tragedy
of
those
people
the
monstrous
cruelty
of
it
all
fortune
took
his
hand
and
patted
it
in
a
funny
affectionate
way
are
too
sensitive
wicky
sensitive
plant
in
a
garden
a
with
its
walls
blown
down
and
dead
bodies
among
the
little
i
try
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
humour
and
a
little
irony
a
funny
old
war
wicky
believe
me
if
you
look
at
it
in
the
right
wickham
groaned
see
no
humour
in
it
nor
light
fortune
chanted
again
the
beginning
of
his
anthem
bill
the
butcher
of
the
as
usual
there
was
a
crowd
about
us
smiling
waving
handkerchiefs
and
small
flags
pressing
forward
to
shake
hands
and
to
say
les
anglais
it
was
out
of
that
crowd
that
a
girl
came
and
stood
in
front
of
us
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
morning
british
officers
english
or
irish
which
is
good
enough
welcome
to
fortune
shook
hands
with
her
first
and
said
very
formally
in
his
mocking
way
do
you
do
are
you
by
chance
my
sister
is
there
a
on
your
left
arm
she
laughed
with
a
big
laugh
on
a
contralto
note
that
was
good
to
hear
sister
who
speaks
the
english
tongue
which
is
fine
to
the
ears
of
me
after
four
years
in
lille
eileen
by
your
leave
eileen

asked

the
long
long

in
the
village
of
london
oh
to
hear
the
roar
of
in
the
high
street
and
to
see
the
glint
of
sunlight
on
the
round
pond
she
was
a
tall
girl
shabbily
dressed
in
an
old
coat
and
skirt
with
a
bit
of
fur
round
her
neck
and
hat
but
with
a
certain
look
of
elegance
in
the
thin
line
of
her
figure
and
the
poise
of
her
head
real
irish
by
the
look
of
her
dark
eyes
and
a
rather
irregular
nose
and
humorous
lips
not
pretty
in
the
english
way
but
spirited
and
with
some
queer
charm
in
her
wickham
brand
was
holding
her
hand
lord
eileen
i
used
to
meet
you
years
ago
at
the
wilmots
those
funny
in
farthing
buns
and
cigarettes
and
young
boys
with
big
ideas
the
girl
laughed
with
a
kind
of
wonderment
and
stood
close
to
wickham
brand
holding
his
sam
brown
belt
and
staring
up
into
his
face
you
must
be
you
must
be
you
are
the
tall
boy
who
used
to
grow
out
of
his
grey
suits
and
wrote
mystical
verse
and
read
tolstoy
and
growled
at
civilisation
and
smoked
black
pipes
and
fell
in
love
with
elderly
models
wickham

said
brand
ignoring
the
laughter
of
fortune
and
myself
i
went
to
germany
and
studied
their
damned
philosophy
and
then
i
became
a
briefless
barrister
and
after
that
took
to
writing
unsuccessful
novels
here
i
am
after
four
years
of
war
ashamed
to
be
alive
when
all
my
pals
are
he
glanced
at
fortune
and
me
and
said
most
of
the
same
wicky
i
remember
said
the
girl
at
the
sight
of
you
i
feel
gone
back
to
myself
as
a
thing
in
a
short
frock
and
long
black
stockings
the
good
old
days
before
the
war
before
other
things
and
all
kinds
of
on
earth
were
you
in
lille
when
the
war
began
asked
brand
just
happened
i
taught
painting
here
then
i
was
caught
with
the
others
we
did
not
think
they
would
come
so
she
used
the
word
as
we
all
did
meaning
the
grey
men
must
have
been
hell
said
brand
hell
said
miss
brightly
least
one
saw
into
the
gulfs
of
hell
and
devilishness
was
close
at
hand
but
there
were
compensations
wee
bits
of
heaven
on
the
whole
i
enjoyed
yourself
brand
was
startled
by
that
phrase
it
was
an
adventure
i
took
risks
and
came
through
i
lived
all
of
it
every
minute
it
was
a
game
with
the
devil
and
death
and
i
dodged
them
both
soit
merci
she
laughed
with
a
little
of
the
head
showing
a
white
full
throat
above
the
ragged
bit
of
fur
a
number
of
french
women
pressed
about
her
some
of
them
patted
her
arms
fondled
her
hands
one
woman
bent
down
and
kissed
her
shabby
jacket
était
merveilleuse
la
demoiselle
said
an
old
frenchman
by
my
side
was
marvellous
sir
all
that
she
did
for
the
wounded
for
your
prisoners
for
many
men
who
owe
their
lives
to
her
can
not
be
told
in
a
little
while
they
tried
to
catch
her
she
was
nearly
caught
it
is
a
miracle
that
she
was
not
shot
a
miracle
monsieur
other
people
in
the
crowd
spoke
to
me
about
they
were
mysterious
even
now
they
could
not
tell
me
all
she
had
done
but
she
had
risked
death
every
day
for
four
years
every
day
truly
it
was
a
miracle
she
was
not
caught
listening
to
them
i
missed
some
of
eileen
own
words
to
brand
and
saw
only
the
wave
of
her
hand
as
she
disappeared
into
the
crowd
it
was
brand
who
told
me
that
he
and
i
and
fortune
had
been
invited
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
or
an
or
so
i
saw
that
wicky
as
we
called
him
was
startled
by
the
meeting
with
her
and
was
glad
of
it
knew
her
when
we
were
kids
he
said
years
ago
perhaps
more
she
used
to
pull
my
hair
extraordinary
coming
face
to
face
with
her
in
lille
on
this
day
of
all
he
turned
to
fortune
with
a
look
of
command
ought
to
get
busy
with
that
advanced
headquarters
there
are
plenty
of
big
houses
in
these

with

rather
comical

bill
wants
us
to
go
on
beating
the
boche
i
insist
on
a
house
with
a
good
piano
german
for
they
went
off
on
their
quest
and
i
to
my
billet
which
had
been
found
by
the
major
of
ours
where
i
wrote
the
story
of
how
we
entered
lille
on
a
typewriter
with
a
twisted
ribbon
which
would
not
write
quickly
enough
all
i
wanted
to
tell
the
world
about
a
day
of
history
iv
i
had
the
luck
to
be
billeted
in
lille
at
the
house
of
madame
chéri
in
the
rue
esquermoise
this
lady
was
the
mother
of
the
girl
with
the
and
the
two
children
with
whom
wickham
brand
had
made
friends
on
this
morning
of
liberation
the
wife
of
that
military
officer
whom
pierre
nesle
had
known
at
verdun
and
knew
to
be
killed
it
was
my
luck
because
there
were
children
in
the
house
the
girl
hélène
was
more
a
woman
than
a
child
though
only
sixteen
and
i
craved
for
a
touch
of
home
life
and
company
after
so
long
an
exile
in
the
always
among
men
who
talked
of
war
thought
of
it
dreamed
of
it
year
in
year
out
madame
chéri
was
i
thought
when
i
saw
her
first
a
beautiful
woman
not
physically
because
she
was
too
white
and
worn
but
spiritually
in
courage
of
soul
pierre
nesle
our
officer
told
me
how
she
had
received
the
news
of
her
death
unflinchingly
without
a
cry
she
knew
she
said
in
her
heart
that
he
was
dead
some
queer
message
had
reached
her
one
night
during
the
verdun
battles
it
was
no
ghost
or
voice
but
only
a
sudden
cold
conviction
that
her
man
had
been
killed
for
the
sake
she
had
pretended
that
their
father
might
come
back
it
gave
them
something
to
look
forward
to
the
little
ones
were
always
harping
on
the
hope
that
when
peace
came
this
mysterious
and
glorious
man
whom
they
remembered
only
vaguely
as
one
who
had
played
bears
with
them
and
had
been
the
provider
of
all
good
things
would
return
with
rich
presents
from
paris
tin
soldiers
mechanical
toys
hélène
the
elder
girl
was
different
she
had
looked
curiously
at
her
mother
when
the
children
prattled
like
that
and
madame
chéri
had
pretended
to
believe
in
the
homecoming
once
or
twice
the
girl
had
said
may
be
killed
in
a
way
yet
she
had
been
his
devoted
comrade
they
had
been
such
lovers
the
father
and
daughter
that
sometimes
the
mother
had
been
a
little
jealous
so
she
said
in
her
frank
way
to
pierre
nesle
smiling
as
she
spoke
the
war
had
made
hélène
a
realist
like
most
french
girls
to
whom
the
idea
of
death
became
commonplace
almost
inevitable
as
the
ceaseless
slaughter
of
men
went
on
the
german
losses
had
taught
them
that
i
had
the
he
had
attained
the
grade
of
colonel
before
verdun
so
pierre
told
me
and
madame
chéri
came
in
while
i
was
there
to
see
that
it
was
properly
arranged
for
me
over
his
iron
bedstead
the
germans
had
taken
the
woollen
mattress
so
that
it
had
been
replaced
by
bags
of
straw
was
his
portrait
as
a
lieutenant
of
artillery
as
he
had
been
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
rather
like
hélène
with
her
delicate
profile
and
brown
eyes
though
more
like
said
madame
chéri
their
eldest
boy
edouard
is
he
i
asked
and
that
was
the
only
time
i
saw
madame
chéri
break
down
utterly
she
began
to
tell
me
that
edouard
had
been
taken
away
by
the
germans
among
all
the
men
and
boys
who
were
sent
away
from
lille
for
digging
trenches
behind
the
lines
in
easter
of
and
that
he
had
gone
bravely
with
his
little
pack
of
clothes
over
his
shoulder
saying
is
nothing
my
father
taught
me
the
word
in
a
little
while
we
shall
win
and
i
shall
be
back
courage
madame
chéri
repeated
her
words
proudly
so
that
i
seemed
to
see
the
boy
with
that
pack
on
his
shoulder
and
a
smile
on
his
face
then
suddenly
she
wept
bitterly
wildly
her
body
shaken
with
a
kind
of
ague
while
she
sat
on
the
iron
bedstead
with
her
face
in
her
hands
i
repeated
the
words
courage
madam
proudly
she
wailed
out
in
broken
sentences
was
such
a
child
he
caught
cold
so
easily
he
was
so
delicate
he
needed
so
much
for
two
years
no
word
has
come
from
him
in
a
little
while
she
controlled
herself
and
begged
me
to
excuse
her
we
went
down
together
to
the
where
the
children
were
playing
and
hélène
was
reading
and
she
insisted
upon
my
drinking
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
store
which
she
had
kept
hidden
from
the
germans
in
a
pit
which
edouard
had
dug
in
the
garden
in
the
first
days
of
the
occupation
the
children
were
delighted
with
that
trick
and
roared
with
laughter
hélène
with
a
curl
of
her
lip
spoke
bitterly
boche
is
a
stupid
animal
one
can
dupe
him
always
easily
said
madame
chéri
she
opened
a
secret
cupboard
behind
a
bookcase
standing
against
the
panelled
wall
hid
all
my
brass
and
copper
here
a
german
police
officer
came
and
said
you
hidden
any
copper
madame
i
said
is
nothing
you
swear
it
he
asked
swear
it
i
answered
very
haughtily
he
went
straight
to
the
bookcase
pushed
it
on
one
side
tapped
the
wall
and
opened
the
secret
which
was
stuffed
full
of
brass
and
copper
are
a
liar
madame
he
said
all
you
are
an
insolent
pig
like
all
germans
i
remarked
that
cost
me
a
fine
of
ten
thousand
madame
chéri
saw
nothing
wrong
in
swearing
falsely
to
a
german
i
think
she
held
that
nothing
was
wrong
to
deceive
or
to
destroy
any
individual
of
the
german
race
and
i
could
understand
her
point
of
view
when
pierre
nesle
told
me
of
one
thing
that
had
happened
which
she
never
told
to
me
it
was
about
hélène
a
german
captain
was
billeted
in
the
house
they
ignored
his
presence
though
he
tried
to
ingratiate
himself
hélène
hated
him
with
a
cold
and
deadly
hatred
she
trembled
if
he
passed
her
on
the
stairs
his
presence
in
the
house
even
if
she
did
not
see
him
but
only
heard
him
move
in
his
room
made
her
feel
ill
yet
he
was
very
polite
to
her
and
said
gnadiges
whenever
they
met
to
edouard
also
he
was
courteous
and
smiling
though
edouard
was
sullen
he
was
a
stout
little
man
with
a
round
rosy
face
and
little
bright
eyes
behind
big
glasses
an
officer
in
the
kommandantur
and
formerly
a
schoolmaster
madame
chéri
was
polite
to
him
but
cold
cold
as
ice
after
some
months
she
found
him
harmless
though
objectionable
because
german
it
did
not
seem
dangerous
to
leave
him
in
the
house
one
evening
when
she
went
to
visit
a
dying
friend
madame
vailly
she
was
later
than
she
meant
to
be
so
late
that
she
was
liable
to
arrest
by
the
military
police
if
they
saw
her
flit
past
in
the
darkness
of
the
unlit
streets
when
she
came
home
she
slipped
the
into
the
door
and
went
quietly
into
the
hall
the
children
would
be
in
bed
and
asleep
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
a
noise
startled
her
it
was
a
curious
creaking
shaking
noise
as
of
a
door
being
pushed
by
some
heavy
weight
then
banged
by
it
it
was
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
on
the
left
room
que
tu
fais
là
said
madame
chéri
she
was
very
frightened
with
some
unknown
fear
and
held
tight
to
the
banister
as
she
went
upstairs
there
was
a
glimmer
of
light
on
the
landing
it
was
from
a
candle
which
had
almost
burnt
out
and
was
guttering
in
a
candlestick
placed
on
the
topmost
stair
a
grotesque
figure
was
revealed
by
the
light
schwarz
the
german
officer
in
his
pyjamas
with
a
helmet
on
his
head
and
unlaced
boots
on
his
feet
the
loose
fat
of
the
man
no
longer
girded
by
a
belt
made
him
look
like
a
mass
of
jelly
as
he
had
his
shoulder
to
the
door
shoving
and
grunting
as
he
tried
to
force
it
open
he
was
swearing
to
himself
in
german
and
now
and
then
called
out
softly
in
french
in
a
kind
of
drunken
kleines
madchen
ma
jolie
schatz
ouvrez
madame
chéri
was
paralysed
for
a
moment
by
a
shock
of
horror
quite
speechless
and
motionless
then
suddenly
she
moved
forward
and
spoke
in
a
fierce
whisper
are
you
doing
beast
schwarz
gave
a
queer
snort
of
alarm
he
stood
swaying
a
little
with
the
helmet
on
the
back
of
his
head
the
candlelight
gleamed
on
its
golden
eagle
his
face
was
hotly
flushed
and
there
was
a
ferocious
look
in
his
eyes
madame
chéri
saw
that
he
was
drunk
he
spoke
to
her
in
horrible
french
so
pierre
nesle
told
me
imitating
it
savagely
as
madame
chéri
had
done
to
him
the
man
was
filthily
drunk
and
declared
that
he
loved
hélène
and
would
kill
her
if
she
did
not
let
him
love
her
why
did
she
lock
her
door
like
that
he
had
been
kind
to
her
he
had
smiled
at
her
a
german
officer
was
a
human
being
not
a
monster
why
did
they
treat
him
as
a
monster
draw
themselves
away
when
he
passed
become
silent
when
he
wished
to
speak
with
them
stare
at
him
with
hate
in
their
eyes
the
french
people
were
all
devils
proud
as
devils
another
figure
stood
on
the
landing
it
was
edouard
a
tall
slim
figure
with
a
white
face
and
burning
eyes
in
which
there
was
a
look
of
fury
is
happening
he
said
coldly
does
this
animal
want
madame
chéri
trembled
with
a
new
fear
if
the
boy
were
to
kill
that
man
he
would
be
shot
she
had
a
vision
of
him
standing
against
a
wall
is
nothing
she
said
gentleman
is
go
back
to
bed
edouard
i
command
the
german
laughed
stupidly
bed
i
am
going
to
open
your
door
she
loves
me
she
calls
to
me
i
hear
her
whisper
liebe
dich
edouard
had
a
stick
in
his
hand
it
was
a
heavy
which
had
belonged
to
his
father
without
a
word
he
sprang
forward
raised
his
weapon
and
smashed
it
down
on
the
head
it
knocked
off
helmet
which
rolled
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
and
hit
the
man
a
glancing
blow
on
the
temple
he
fell
like
a
log
edouard
smiled
and
said
then
he
rattled
the
lock
of
his
door
and
called
out
to
her
have
no
fear
he
is
dead
i
have
killed
it
was
then
that
madame
chéri
had
her
greatest
fear
there
was
no
sound
from
hélène
she
did
not
answer
any
of
their
cries
she
did
not
open
the
door
to
them
they
tried
to
force
the
lock
as
schwarz
had
done
but
though
the
lock
gave
at
last
the
door
would
not
open
kept
closed
by
some
barricade
behind
it
edouard
and
his
mother
went
out
into
the
yard
and
the
boy
climbed
up
to
his
window
and
broke
the
glass
to
go
through
hélène
was
lying
in
her
nightdress
on
the
bedroom
floor
unconscious
she
had
moved
a
heavy
wardrobe
in
front
of
the
door
by
some
supernatural
strength
which
came
from
fear
then
she
had
fainted
to
his
deep
regret
edouard
had
not
killed
the
german
schwarz
had
crawled
back
to
his
bedroom
when
they
went
back
into
the
house
and
next
morning
wept
to
madame
chéri
and
implored
forgiveness
there
had
been
a
little
banquet
he
said
and
he
had
drunk
too
much
madame
chéri
did
not
forgive
she
called
at
the
kommandantur
where
the
general
saw
her
and
listened
to
her
gravely
he
did
not
waste
words
matter
will
be
attended
to
he
said
captain
schwarz
departed
that
day
from
the
house
in
the
rue
esquermoise
he
was
sent
to
a
battalion
in
the
line
and
was
killed
somewhere
near
ypres
v
wickham
brand
paid
his
promised
visit
to
the
chéri
family
according
to
his
pledge
to
hélène
whom
he
had
met
in
the
street
the
previous
day
and
he
had
to
drink
some
of
the
hidden
wine
as
i
had
done
and
heard
the
story
of
its
concealment
and
of
oath
about
the
secret
hoard
of
copper
i
think
he
was
more
disconcerted
than
i
had
been
by
that
avowal
and
told
me
afterwards
that
he
believed
no
englishwoman
would
have
sworn
to
so
deliberate
a
lie
because
the
english
are
not
so
logical
i
said
and
he
puzzled
over
that
he
was
greatly
taken
with
hélène
as
she
with
him
but
he
risked
their
friendship
in
an
awkward
moment
when
he
expressed
the
hope
that
the
german
offer
of
peace
the
one
before
the
final
surrender
would
be
accepted
it
was
madame
chéri
who
took
him
up
on
that
sharply
and
with
a
kind
of
surprised
anguish
in
her
voice
she
hoped
she
said
that
no
peace
would
be
made
with
germany
until
french
and
british
and
american
troops
had
smashed
the
german
armies
crossed
the
german
frontier
and
destroyed
many
german
towns
and
villages
she
would
not
be
satisfied
with
any
peace
that
came
before
a
full
vengeance
so
that
german
women
would
taste
the
bitterness
of
war
as
frenchwomen
had
drunk
deep
of
it
and
until
germany
was
heaped
with
ruins
as
france
had
been
wickham
brand
was
sitting
with
the
small
boy
on
his
knees
and
stroked
his
hair
before
answering
donc
said
hélène
who
was
sitting
on
the
hearthrug
looking
up
at
his
powerful
profile
which
reminded
me
always
of
a
norman
knight
or
sometimes
of
a
young
monk
worried
about
his
soul
and
the
devil
he
had
that
monkish
look
now
when
he
answered
know
he
said
have
felt
like
that
often
but
i
have
come
to
think
that
the
sooner
we
get
blood
out
of
our
eyes
the
better
for
all
the
world
i
have
seen
enough
dead
germans
and
dead
english
and
dead
french
to
last
a
lifetime
many
of
the
german
soldiers
hate
the
war
as
i
know
and
curse
the
men
who
drove
them
on
to
it
they
are
trapped
they
can
not
escape
from
the
thing
they
curse
because
of
their
discipline
their
patriotism
patriotism
said
madame
chéri
she
was
really
angry
with
brand
and
i
noticed
that
even
hélène
drew
back
a
little
from
her
place
on
the
rug
and
looked
perplexed
and
disappointed
madame
chéri
ridiculed
the
idea
of
german
patriotism
they
were
brutes
who
liked
war
except
when
they
feared
defeat
they
had
committed
a
thousand
atrocities
out
of
sheer
joy
in
bestial
cruelty
their
idea
of
patriotism
was
and
the
oppression
of
people
more
civilised
than
themselves
they
hated
all
people
who
were
not
savages
like
themselves
wickham
brand
shook
his
head
not
all
as
bad
as
that
i
knew
decent
people
among
them
before
the
war
for
a
time
of
course
they
went
mad
they
were
poisoned
by
the
damnable
philosophy
of
their
leaders
and
liked
the
poison
said
madame
chéri
lapped
it
up
it
is
in
their
blood
and
spirits
they
are
foul
through
and
are
devils
said
hélène
she
shuddered
as
though
she
felt
very
cold
even
the
small
boy
on
knees
said
boches
brand
groaned
in
a
whimsical
way
have
said
all
those
things
a
thousand
times
they
nearly
drove
me
mad
but
now
time
to
stop
the
river
of
blood
if
the
german
army
will
acknowledge
defeat
i
would
not
go
on
a
day
after
that
for
our
own
sakes
for
the
sake
of
french
boys
and
english
every
day
more
of
war
means
more
dead
of
ours
more
blind
more
crippled
and
more
agony
of
soul
i
want
some
of
our
boyhood
to
be
madame
chéri
answered
coldly
before
the
germans
have
been
punished
not
before
that
if
we
all
hélène
sprang
up
with
a
passionate
gesture
german
babies
ought
to
be
strangled
in
their
cradles
before
they
grow
up
to
be
fat
beastly
she
was
thinking
of
schwarz
i
imagine
it
was
the
horror
of
remembrance
which
made
her
so
fierce
then
she
laughed
and
said
let
us
be
glad
because
yesterday
we
were
liberated
do
not
quarrel
with
an
english
officer
he
helped
to
save
she
put
her
hands
on
wickham
shoulders
and
said
mon
capitaine
so
the
conversation
turned
and
wickham
won
them
back
by
his
courtesy
and
by
a
tribute
to
the
courage
of
french
civilians
behind
the
lines
of
whom
he
told
many
haunting
stories
but
when
i
walked
round
with
him
to
his
mess
we
were
going
round
later
to
see
eileen
he
referred
back
to
the
incident
small
is
he
referred
to
the
little
american
doctor
hatred
of
these
people
is
transcendental
it
is
like
a
spiritual
flame
it
is
above
all
kindly
human
instincts
life
itself
that
woman
would
sacrifice
herself
and
her
children
as
quietly
as
she
heard
the
death
of
her
husband
rather
than
grant
the
germans
peace
without
victory
and
vengeance
how
can
there
be
any
peace
whatever
treaty
is
signed
can
europe
ever
get
peace
with
all
this
hatred
as
a
heritage
vi
we
walked
silently
towards
the
boulevard
de
la
liberté
where
little
crowd
had
established
their
headquarters
right
he
said
presently
the
hatred
is
divine
i
may
be
weakening
because
of
all
the
then
he
was
silent
again
and
while
i
walked
by
his
side
i
thought
back
to
his
career
as
i
had
known
it
in
the
war
rather
well
he
had
always
been
tortured
by
agonised
perplexities
i
had
guessed
that
by
the
look
of
the
man
and
some
of
his
odd
phrases
and
his
restlessness
and
foolhardiness
it
was
in
the
trenches
by
fricourt
that
i
had
first
seen
him
long
before
the
battles
of
the
somme
he
was
sitting
motionless
on
a
wooden
box
staring
through
a
periscope
towards
the
mine
craters
and
the
bois
français
in
no
land
the
fine
hardness
of
his
profile
the
strength
of
his
jaw
not
massive
but
with
one
clean
line
from
ear
to
chin
and
something
in
the
utter
intensity
of
his
attitude
attracted
my
attention
and
i
asked
the
colonel
about
him
is
that
fellow
like
a
norman
knight
the
colonel
of
the
laughed
as
we
went
round
the
next
bay
ducking
our
heads
where
the
sandbags
had
slipped
down
back
than
norman
he
said
the
primitive
he
told
me
that
wickham
brand
a
lieutenant
then
was
a
young
barrister
who
had
joined
the
battalion
at
the
beginning
of
he
had
taken
up
sniping
and
made
himself
a
dead
shot
he
had
the
instinct
and
would
wait
hours
behind
the
sandbags
for
the
sight
of
a
german
head
in
the
trendies
opposite
he
seldom
missed
his
man
or
that
part
of
his
body
which
showed
for
a
second
lately
he
had
taken
to
the
habit
of
crawling
out
into
no
land
and
waiting
in
some
for
the
dawn
when
germans
came
out
to
mend
their
wire
or
drag
in
a
dead
body
he
generally
left
another
dead
man
as
a
bait
for
the
living
then
he
would
come
back
with
a
grim
smile
and
eat
his
breakfast
wolfishly
after
cutting
a
notch
in
one
of
the
beams
of
his
a
body
and
soul
said
the
colonel
want
more
of
all
the
same
brand
makes
me
feel
queer
by
his
ferocity
i
like
a
humorous
fellow
who
does
his
killing
after
that
i
met
brand
and
took
a
drink
with
him
in
his
he
answered
my
remarks
gruffly
for
a
time
hear
you
go
in
for
sniping
a
good
deal
i
said
by
way
of
conversation
murder
made
you
get
many
targets
a
waiting
game
sometimes
they
get
he
puffed
at
a
black
old
pipe
quite
silent
for
a
time
presently
he
told
me
about
a
who
popped
his
head
over
the
parapet
twice
to
stare
at
something
on
the
edge
of
the
mine
crater
spared
him
twice
the
third
time
i
said
dead
and
let
go
at
him
the
kid
was
too
easy
to
something
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
told
me
that
he
hated
himself
for
that
a
pity
i
mumbled
he
said
there
was
a
candle
burning
on
the
wooden
bench
on
which
he
leaned
his
elbow
and
by
the
light
of
it
i
saw
that
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
there
was
a
haggard
look
on
his
face
must
need
some
nerve
i
said
awkwardly
go
out
so
often
in
no
land
real
he
stared
at
me
as
though
surprised
and
then
laughed
harshly
that
scared
stiff
half
the
time
do
you
think
i
like
it
he
seemed
to
get
angry
was
angry
i
think
any
of
us
like
it
these
damn
things
that
blow
men
to
bits
make
rags
of
them
tear
their
bowels
out
and
their
eyes
or
to
live
on
top
of
a
mine
crater
as
we
are
now
never
knowing
when
going
up
in
smoke
and
flame
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
yourself
you
can
take
my
share
i
have
never
met
a
man
who
yet
when
brand
was
taken
out
of
the
trenches
by
a
word
spoken
over
the
telephone
from
corps
headquarters
because
of
his
knowledge
of
german
and
his
cousinship
to
a
lady
who
was
a
friend
of
the
corps
niece
he
was
miserable
and
savage
i
met
him
many
times
after
that
as
an
intelligence
officer
at
the
corps
cages
examining
prisoners
on
days
of
battle
job
he
said
saving
my
skin
while
the
youngsters
he
stood
outside
his
hut
one
day
on
a
morning
of
battle
in
the
somme
fields
up
by
pozières
no
prisoners
had
yet
come
down
he
forgot
my
presence
and
stood
listening
to
the
fury
of
and
watching
the
smoke
and
flame
away
there
on
the
ridge
he
cried
am
i
here
why
i
with
my
pals
up
there
getting
blown
to
blood
and
pulp
blood
and
pulp
blood
and
pulp
then
he
remembered
me
and
turned
in
a
shamefaced
way
and
said
i
feel
rather
hipped
i
was
present
sometimes
at
his
examination
of
prisoners
those
poor
grey
muddy
wretches
who
came
dazed
out
of
the
slime
and
shambles
sometimes
he
bullied
them
harshly
in
fluent
german
and
they
trembled
at
his
ferocity
of
speech
even
whimpered
now
and
then
but
once
or
twice
he
was
in
quite
a
different
mood
with
them
and
spoke
gently
assenting
when
they
cursed
the
war
and
its
misery
and
said
that
all
they
wanted
was
peace
and
home
again
you
fellows
going
to
revolt
he
asked
one
man
a
you
going
to
tell
your
war
lords
to
go
to
hell
and
stop
all
this
silly
massacre
before
germany
is
the
german
shrugged
his
shoulders
would
if
we
could
it
is
impossible
discipline
is
too
strong
for
us
it
has
enslaved
true
said
brand
are
slaves
of
a
he
spoke
a
strange
sentence
in
english
as
he
glanced
over
to
me
am
beginning
to
think
we
are
all
slaves
of
a
system
none
of
us
can
break
the
it
was
after
that
day
that
brand
took
a
fancy
to
me
for
some
reason
inviting
me
to
his
mess
where
i
met
charles
fortune
and
others
and
it
was
there
that
i
heard
amazing
discussions
about
the
philosophy
of
war
german
psychology
the
object
of
life
the
relation
of
christianity
to
war
and
the
decadence
of
europe
brand
himself
sometimes
led
these
discussions
with
a
savage
humour
which
delighted
charles
fortune
who
egged
him
on
he
was
always
pessimistic
sceptical
challenging
bitter
and
now
and
then
so
violent
in
his
criticisms
of
england
the
government
the
army
council
the
staff
and
above
all
the
press
that
most
of
his
fellow
officers
apart
from
fortune
thought
he
went
bit
too
dear
old
harding
who
was
tory
to
the
backbone
with
a
deep
respect
for
all
in
authority
accused
him
of
being
a
revolutionary
and
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
though
there
would
be
hot
words
until
brand
laughed
in
a
way
and
said
dear
fellow
only
talking
academic
rot
i
a
conviction
ever
since
the
war
began
i
have
been
trying
to
make
head
or
tail
of
things
in
a
of
doubt
all
i
know
is
that
i
want
the
bloody
orgy
to
end
somehow
and
victory
said
harding
solemnly
the
destruction
of
prussian
philosophy
everywhere
said
brand
they
agreed
on
that
but
i
could
see
that
brand
was
on
shifting
ground
and
i
knew
as
our
friendship
deepened
that
he
was
getting
beyond
a
religion
of
mere
hate
and
was
looking
for
some
other
kind
of
faith
occasionally
he
harked
back
as
on
the
day
in
lille
when
i
walked
by
his
side
vii
i
dined
with
him
in
his
mess
that
evening
before
going
on
with
him
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
eileen
who
had
a
room
in
some
convent
on
the
outskirts
of
lille
the
advanced
headquarters
of
this
little
group
of
officers
had
been
established
in
one
of
those
big
private
houses
which
belong
to
the
rich
manufacturers
and
business
people
of
lille
rich
before
the
war
but
with
desolate
factories
stripped
of
all
machinery
during
the
german
occupation
and
afterwards
with
large
rooms
built
round
a
courtyard
and
barred
off
from
the
street
by
the
big
front
door
there
was
a
motor
lorry
inside
the
door
which
was
wide
open
and
some
orderlies
were
unloading
boxes
of
maps
kit
a
mahogany
gramophone
and
other
paraphernalia
under
the
direction
of
a
young
cockney
sergeant
who
wanted
to
know
why
the
blazes
they
look
slippy
you
know
a
war
on
he
asked
a
stolid
old
soldier
one
of
the
heroes
of
mons
who
was
sitting
on
a
case
of
whisky
with
a
wistful
look
as
though
reflecting
on
the
unfair
privileges
of
officers
with
so
much
wealth
of
drink
all
right
if
not
too
close
to
it
said
the
mons
hero
seen
enough
done
my
bleeding
bit
for
king
and
country
south
africa
egypt
your
jaw
said
the
sergeant
down
that
blarsted
said
the
mons
hero
no
blarsted
gramophones
in
south
africa
this
is
a
different
kind
of
war
more
comfort
about
it
if
not
in
the
wickham
brand
took
me
through
the
courtyard
and
mentioned
that
the
colonel
had
come
up
from
omer
sure
to
beat
the
boche
he
said
from
a
room
to
the
left
of
the
courtyard
came
the
sound
of
a
flute
playing
one
of
minuets
very
sweetly
with
an
grace
wonderful
army
of
ours
said
brand
imagine
a
german
colonel
of
the
staff
playing
seventeenth
century
music
on
a
bit
of
ivory
while
the
enemy
is
fighting
like
a
tiger
at
our
strength
i
answered
amateurs
refuse
to
take
the
war
too
seriously
i
know
a
young
gunner
major
who
travels
a
banjo
in
his
limber
and
at
cambrai
i
saw
fellows
playing
within
ten
yards
of
their
dead
bodies
a
pile
of
the
colonel
saw
us
through
his
window
and
waved
his
flute
at
us
when
i
went
into
the
room
after
a
salute
at
the
doorway
i
saw
that
he
had
already
littered
it
with
artistic
untidiness
sheets
of
torn
music
sketches
books
of
poetry
and
an
array
of
splendid
shining
boots
of
which
a
pair
stood
on
the
mahogany
sideboard
beautiful
little
passage
this
said
colonel
lavington
smiling
at
me
over
the
flute
which
he
put
to
his
lips
again
he
played
a
bar
or
two
of
melody
and
said
that
perfect
you
see
the
little
ladies
in
their
brocades
and
shoes
he
had
his
look
his
face
with
long
nose
and
thin
humorous
mouth
lighted
up
by
his
dark
smiling
eyes
a
bad
headquarters
he
said
putting
down
the
flute
again
we
can
only
stay
here
a
little
while
instead
of
having
to
jog
on
again
an
excellent
piano
in
the
german
thank
goodness
and
charles
fortune
and
i
can
really
get
down
to
some
serious
the
war
i
asked
he
said
yes
the
war
going
on
all
right
be
out
of
tournai
in
a
few
days
perhaps
out
of
maubeuge
and
mons
oh
the
up
very
soon
the
intellectuals
will
be
looking
round
for
a
living
in
dear
old
london
my
goodness
some
of
us
will
find
peace
a
difficult
job
i
can
see
boredom
approaching
with
its
colossal
shadow
after
all
it
has
been
a
great
game
on
the
i
laughed
but
something
stuck
in
my
throat
colonel
lavington
played
the
flute
but
he
knew
his
job
and
was
in
touch
with
general
headquarters
and
all
its
secret
information
it
was
obvious
that
he
believed
the
war
was
going
to
end
soon
soon
o
lord
after
all
the
years
of
massacre
i
blurted
out
a
straight
question
you
think
a
real
chance
of
peace
the
colonel
was
reading
a
piece
of
music
humming
it
with
a
la
la
la
month
and
our
done
he
said
you
heard
that
bit
of
gluck
i
stayed
with
him
a
little
while
and
did
not
follow
a
note
of
his
music
i
was
excited
by
the
supreme
hope
he
had
given
me
so
there
was
to
be
an
end
of
massacre
and
my
own
hopes
had
not
been
false
at
the
mess
table
that
night
charles
fortune
was
in
good
form
we
sat
in
a
room
which
was
rather
handsomely
furnished
in
a
heavy
way
with
big
bronzes
on
the
mantelpiece
ticketed
for
exemption
from
requisition
as
family
heirlooms
and
some
rather
good
portraits
of
a
french
family
from
the
eighteenth
century
onwards
on
the
panelled
walls
the
had
told
us
that
it
had
been
the
mess
of
a
german
headquarters
and
this
gave
fortune
his
cue
and
he
entertained
us
with
some
caricatures
of
german
generals
and
officers
amazingly
comic
he
drank
his
soup
in
the
style
of
a
german
general
and
ate
his
potato
pie
as
a
german
intelligence
officer
who
had
once
been
a
professor
of
psychology
at
heidelberg
the
little
american
doctor
small
as
we
called
him
had
been
made
an
honorary
member
of
the
mess
and
he
smiled
at
fortune
through
his
spectacles
with
an
air
of
delighted
surprise
that
such
things
should
be
english
he
said
in
his
solemn
way
the
most
baffling
people
in
the
world
i
have
been
studying
you
since
i
came
to
france
and
all
my
preconceived
ideas
have
been
knocked
on
the
head
we
americans
think
you
are
a
hard
arrogant
selfish
people
without
humour
or
sympathy
made
in
set
moulds
turned
out
as
types
from
your
university
and
public
schools
that
is
all
wrong
i
am
beginning
to
see
that
you
are
more
human
more
various
more
whimsical
than
any
race
in
the
world
you
decline
to
take
life
seriously
you
take
even
death
seriously
this
war
you
make
a
joke
of
it
the
germans
you
kill
them
in
great
numbers
but
you
have
a
secret
liking
for
them
caricatures
are
very
comical
but
not
unkind
i
believe
fortune
is
a
you
can
not
laugh
at
the
people
you
hate
i
believe
england
will
forgive
germany
quicker
than
any
other
nation
far
quicker
than
the
americans
france
of
course
will
never
said
pierre
nesle
who
was
at
the
end
of
the
table
will
never
are
an
illogical
people
said
the
colonel
is
only
logical
people
who
can
go
on
hating
besides
german
music
is
so
good
harding
who
read
no
paper
but
the
said
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
would
never
speak
to
a
german
again
in
his
life
he
would
like
to
see
the
whole
race
exterminated
but
he
was
afraid
of
the
socialists
with
their
pestilential
doctrine
of
of
lloyd
george
also
filled
him
with
the
gravest
misgivings
eyes
twinkled
at
him
is
the
old
caste
that
speaks
tradition
against
the
new
world
of
ideas
of
course
there
will
always
be
conflict
that
is
a
wonderful
phrase
pestilential
doctrine
of
the
brotherhood
of
i
must
make
a
note
of
oh
you
doctor
said
fortune
are
always
jotting
down
notes
about
us
i
shall
find
myself
docketed
as
gentleman
grade
inclined
to
obesity
humorous
strain
of
insanity
due
to
small
laughed
in
a
high
treble
and
then
was
serious
noting
down
everything
my
own
psychology
which
alarms
me
facts
anecdotes
scenes
words
i
want
to
find
a
law
somewhere
the
essential
thing
in
human
nature
after
the
war
if
there
is
any
afterwards
i
want
to
search
for
a
way
out
of
the
jungle
this
jungle
civilisation
there
must
be
daylight
somewhere
for
the
human
you
find
it
said
brand
earnestly
me
will
said
small
and
i
remembered
that
pledge
afterwards
when
he
and
brand
were
together
in
a
doomed
city
trying
to
avert
the
doom
because
of
that
impulse
which
urged
them
to
find
a
little
daylight
beyond
the
darkness
young
clatworthy
jerked
his
chair
on
the
polished
boards
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
colonel
who
was
discoursing
on
the
origins
of
art
religion
sex
the
perception
of
form
colonel
lavington
grinned
at
him
right
cyril
i
know
you
have
got
a
rendezvous
with
some
girl
let
us
keep
you
from
your
career
of
a
matter
of
fact
sir
i
met
a
sweet
little
thing
yesterday
clatworthy
knew
that
his
reputation
as
an
amorist
did
not
displease
the
colonel
who
was
a
romantic
and
loved
youth
in
a
gust
of
laughter
the
mess
broke
up
charles
fortune
and
the
colonel
prepared
for
an
orgy
of
bach
over
the
piano
in
the
of
that
house
in
lille
those
who
cared
to
listen
might
or
not
as
they
pleased
brand
and
i
went
out
into
the
streets
now
unlit
by
any
glimmer
of
gas
and
made
our
way
to
the
convent
where
the
girl
eileen
lodged
we
passed
a
number
of
british
soldiers
in
the
boulevard
de
la
liberté
wearing
their
steel
hats
and
carrying
their
packs
a
group
of
them
stopped
under
a
doorway
to
light
cigarettes
one
of
them
spoke
to
his
pals
tell
me
some
bonny
wenches
in
this
said
another
i
could
do
some
hugging
in
a
cosy
billet
said
the
third
with
a
cockney
voice
or
trenches
the
poor
bloody
soldier
gets
it
in
the
neck
curse
this
pack
fed
up
with
the
whole
damn
show
i
want
a
hoarse
laugh
answered
him
you
believe
that
talk
in
the
papers
chum
a
hell
of
a
long
way
to
the
rhine
and
you
and
be
dead
before
we
get
they
slouched
off
into
the
darkness
three
points
of
light
where
their
cigarettes
glowed
lads
said
brand
viii
we
fumbled
our
way
to
a
street
on
the
edge
of
the
canal
according
to
uncanny
sense
of
direction
and
his
remembrance
of
what
the
irish
girl
had
told
him
there
we
found
the
convent
a
square
building
behind
big
gates
we
pulled
a
bell
which
jangled
loudly
and
presently
the
gate
opened
an
inch
letting
through
the
light
of
a
lantern
which
revealed
the
coif
of
a
nun
va
là
brand
told
her
that
we
had
come
to
see
miss
and
the
gate
was
opened
wider
and
we
went
into
the
courtyard
where
a
young
nun
stood
smiling
she
spoke
in
english
were
always
frightened
when
the
bell
rang
during
the
german
occupation
one
never
knew
what
might
happen
and
we
were
afraid
for
miss
asked
brand
the
little
nun
laughed
did
dangerous
work
they
suspected
her
she
came
here
after
her
arrest
before
then
she
had
rooms
of
her
own
oh
her
courage
her
devotion
truly
she
was
heroic
she
led
us
into
a
long
corridor
with
doors
on
each
side
and
out
of
one
door
came
a
little
group
of
nuns
with
eileen
the
irish
girl
came
towards
us
with
outstretched
hands
which
she
gave
first
to
brand
she
seemed
excited
at
our
coming
and
explained
that
the
reverend
mother
and
all
the
nuns
wanted
to
see
us
to
thank
england
by
means
of
us
to
hear
something
about
the
war
and
the
chance
of
victory
from
the
first
english
officers
they
had
seen
brand
was
presented
to
the
reverend
mother
a
massive
old
lady
with
a
slight
moustache
on
the
upper
lip
and
dark
luminous
eyes
reminding
me
of
the
portrait
of
savonarola
at
florence
the
other
nuns
crowded
round
us
eager
to
ask
questions
still
more
eager
to
talk
some
of
them
were
quite
young
and
pretty
though
all
rather
white
and
fragile
and
they
had
a
vivacious
gaiety
so
that
the
building
resounded
with
laughter
it
was
eileen
who
made
them
laugh
by
her
reminiscences
of
girlhood
when
she
and
brand
were
when
she
used
to
pull
hair
and
hide
the
pipe
he
smoked
too
soon
she
asked
him
to
take
off
his
so
that
she
might
see
whether
the
same
old
unruly
tuft
still
stuck
up
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
she
and
all
the
nuns
clapped
hands
when
she
found
it
was
so
in
spite
of
and
steel
hats
all
this
had
to
be
translated
into
french
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
could
not
understand
such
rapid
english
believe
you
would
like
to
give
it
a
tug
now
said
brand
bending
his
head
down
and
eileen
agreed
indeed
i
would
but
for
scandalising
a
whole
community
of
nuns
to
say
nothing
of
reverend
the
reverend
mother
laughed
in
a
curiously
deep
voice
and
a
crowd
of
little
wrinkles
puckered
at
her
eyes
she
told
miss
that
even
her
irish
audacity
would
not
go
as
far
as
that
which
was
a
challenge
accepted
on
the
instant
little
tug
for
old
sake
said
the
girl
and
brand
yelped
with
pretended
pain
at
the
vigour
of
her
pull
while
all
the
nuns
screamed
with
delight
then
a
clock
struck
and
the
reverend
mother
touched
eileen
as
afterwards
i
called
her
on
the
arm
and
said
she
would
leave
her
with
her
friends
one
by
one
the
nuns
bowed
to
us
all
smiling
under
their
white
and
then
went
down
the
corridor
through
an
open
door
which
led
into
a
chapel
as
we
could
see
by
twinkling
candlelight
presently
the
music
of
an
organ
and
of
voices
came
through
the
closed
doors
eileen
took
us
into
a
little
parlour
where
there
were
just
four
rush
chairs
and
a
table
and
on
the
clean
whitewashed
walls
a
crucifix
brand
took
a
chair
by
the
table
rather
awkwardly
i
thought
gay
they
are
he
said
do
not
seem
to
have
been
touched
by
the
horrors
of
is
the
gaiety
of
faith
said
eileen
else
could
they
have
survived
the
work
they
have
done
the
things
they
have
seen
this
convent
was
a
shambles
for
more
than
three
years
these
rooms
were
filled
with
wounded
german
wounded
and
often
english
wounded
who
were
prisoners
they
were
the
worst
cases
for
amputation
and
work
and
the
nuns
did
all
the
nursing
they
know
all
there
is
to
know
of
suffering
and
they
have
not
forgotten
how
to
laugh
said
brand
is
wonderful
it
is
a
mystery
to
must
have
seen
bad
things
said
eileen
you
lost
the
gift
of
laughter
said
brand
once
for
a
long
eileen
put
her
hands
to
her
breast
learn
it
again
she
said
we
can
not
laugh
we
can
not
work
why
i
owe
my
life
to
a
sense
of
she
spoke
the
last
words
with
more
than
a
trivial
meaning
they
seemed
to
tell
of
some
singular
episode
and
brand
asked
her
to
explain
she
did
not
explain
then
she
only
said
some
vague
things
about
laughing
herself
out
of
prison
and
stopping
a
german
bullet
with
a
smile
did
the
devils
put
you
in
prison
asked
brand
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
lille
it
was
bad
form
if
one
had
not
been
arrested
once
at
least
i
was
three
weeks
in
a
cell
half
the
size
of
this
and
twenty
women
were
with
me
there
there
was
very
little
she
proved
her
sense
of
humour
then
by
that
laugh
of
hers
but
i
noticed
that
just
for
a
second
behind
the
smile
in
her
eyes
there
crept
a
shadow
as
at
the
remembrance
of
some
horror
and
that
she
shivered
a
little
as
though
some
coldness
had
touched
her
must
have
been
like
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
said
brand
measuring
the
space
with
his
eyes
women
herded
in
a
room
like
that
me
for
said
eileen
had
no
means
of
she
used
an
awful
phrase
were
a
living
god
said
brand
eileen
waved
back
the
remembrance
me
of
england
and
of
ireland
the
little
green
isle
has
it
done
well
in
the
war
irish
troops
fought
like
heroes
said
brand
there
were
not
enough
of
them
recruiting
was
slow
and
there
was
some
he
did
not
speak
about
the
irish
rebellion
heard
about
it
vaguely
from
prisoners
said
the
girl
was
fault
i
expect
dear
old
blundering
england
who
is
a
tyrant
through
fear
and
twists
irish
loyalty
into
treason
by
ropes
of
red
tape
in
which
the
irish
mind
gets
strangled
and
awry
well
another
subject
to
avoid
i
want
to
hear
only
good
things
tell
me
of
london
of
kensington
gardens
of
the
way
from
strand
to
temple
bar
of
the
lights
that
gleam
along
the
embankment
when
lovers
go
and
see
stars
in
the
old
black
river
are
they
all
there
are
all
changed
said
brand
is
a
place
of
gloom
there
are
no
lights
along
the
embankment
they
have
dowsed
their
glims
for
fear
of
there
are
few
lovers
some
of
the
boys
lie
dead
round
ypres
or
somewhere
on
the
somme
or
weep
out
of
blind
eyes
or
gibber
in
homes
or
try
to
hop
on
one
leg
while
waiting
for
artificial
limbs
or
trudge
on
towards
maubeuge
where
german
wait
for
them
behind
the
ditches
along
the
strand
goes
the
painted
flapper
luring
men
to
hell
in
kensington
gardens
there
are
training
camps
for
more
boys
for
the
shambles
and
here
and
there
among
the
trees
young
mothers
who
are
widows
before
they
knew
their
wifehood
there
is
vice
the
gaiety
of
madness
the
unspeakable
callousness
of
people
who
get
rich
on
war
or
earn
fat
wages
and
in
small
stricken
homes
a
world
of
secret
grief
that
is
london
in
time
of
war
i
hate
brand
spoke
with
bitterness
and
a
melancholy
that
startled
the
girl
who
sat
with
folded
hands
below
the
crucifix
on
the
whitewashed
wall
behind
her
god
is
it
like
that
she
stared
at
the
wall
opposite
as
though
it
were
a
window
through
which
she
saw
london
of
course
it
is
like
that
here
in
lille
we
thought
we
were
suffering
more
than
anybody
in
the
world
that
was
our
egotism
we
did
not
realise
not
in
our
souls
that
everywhere
in
the
world
of
war
there
was
equal
suffering
the
same
cruelty
perhaps
the
same
temptation
to
brand
repented
i
think
of
having
led
the
conversation
into
such
abysmal
gloom
he
switched
off
to
more
cheerful
things
and
gave
some
elaborate
sketches
of
soldiers
he
knew
to
which
eileen
played
up
with
anecdotes
of
rare
comedy
about
the
nuns
the
fat
nun
who
under
the
rigour
of
war
rations
became
as
slim
as
a
willow
and
was
vain
of
her
new
grace
the
little
french
mm
who
had
no
fear
of
german
officers
and
dared
their
fury
by
prophecies
of
defeat
but
was
terrified
of
a
mouse
in
the
refectory
the
reverend
mother
who
borrowed
a
from
an
english
tommy
he
had
hidden
it
in
his
shirt
to
shave
her
upper
lip
lest
the
germans
should
think
her
a
french
in
disguise
more
interesting
to
me
than
anything
that
was
said
were
the
things
unspoken
by
eileen
and
brand
in
spite
of
the
easy
way
of
laughter
her
quick
wit
her
avoidance
if
possible
of
any
reference
to
her
own
suffering
i
seemed
to
see
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
face
the
strain
of
a
long
ordeal
some
frightful
adventure
of
life
in
which
she
had
taken
great
hazards
the
people
had
told
me
she
had
risked
her
life
often
and
a
courage
which
had
been
tested
by
that
experience
and
had
not
failed
though
perhaps
at
in
the
worst
hours
i
supposed
her
age
was
or
so
i
guessed
it
right
this
side
of
a
year
but
there
was
already
a
streak
of
grey
in
her
dark
hair
and
her
eyes
so
smiling
as
a
rule
looked
as
if
they
had
often
wept
i
think
the
presence
of
brand
was
a
great
pleasure
to
her
bringing
to
lille
a
link
with
her
childhood
and
i
saw
that
she
was
studying
the
personality
of
this
friend
of
hers
and
the
strong
character
of
his
face
not
unscathed
by
the
touch
of
war
with
curious
penetrating
interest
i
felt
in
the
way
and
left
them
together
with
a
fair
excuse
i
had
always
work
to
do
and
i
was
pleased
that
i
did
so
they
were
so
obviously
glad
to
have
a
more
intimate
talk
about
old
friends
and
old
times
ix
i
gained
by
my
unselfishness
i
did
not
want
to
go
for
the
reverend
mother
met
me
in
the
corridor
and
stood
talking
to
me
about
eileen
and
told
me
part
of
the
story
which
i
found
strange
in
its
drama
though
she
left
out
the
scene
of
greatest
interest
as
i
heard
later
from
eileen
herself
the
girl
had
come
to
lille
just
before
the
war
as
an
art
mistress
in
an
de
jeunes
her
parents
in
kensington
had
too
big
a
family
to
keep
them
all
with
lessons
twice
a
week
at
the
convent
and
private
pupils
in
her
own
rooms
she
learned
to
speak
french
quickly
and
charmingly
and
her
gift
of
humour
her
irish
frankness
and
comradeship
made
her
popular
among
her
pupils
so
that
she
had
many
invitations
to
their
homes
and
became
well
known
in
the
best
houses
of
lille
mostly
belonging
to
rich
manufacturers
a
commonplace
story
till
then
but
when
the
germans
occupied
lille
this
irish
girl
became
one
of
the
chief
characters
in
a
drama
that
was
exciting
and
fantastic
to
the
point
of
melodrama
it
was
she
who
organised
the
lille
branch
of
a
secret
society
of
women
with
a
network
all
over
northern
france
and
belgium
the
world
remembers
nurse
cavell
at
brussels
for
the
escape
of
young
civilians
of
military
age
and
prisoners
of
war
combining
that
work
frightfully
perilous
with
espionage
on
german
movements
of
troops
and
other
facts
that
might
be
of
value
to
the
belgian
army
and
through
them
to
england
and
france
it
was
out
of
an
old
book
of
jules
verne
called
that
she
copied
the
cypher
in
which
she
wrote
her
messages
in
invisible
ink
on
linen
handkerchiefs
and
rags
and
she
had
an
audacity
of
invention
in
numberless
small
tricks
and
plots
which
constantly
broke
through
the
meshes
of
the
german
network
of
military
police
had
a
contempt
for
their
stupidity
said
the
reverend
mother
them
dunderheads
and
one
strange
word
of
which
i
do
not
know
the
meaning
and
i
trembled
at
the
risks
she
she
lived
with
one
maid
in
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
house
near
the
jardin
the
rest
of
the
house
being
used
as
the
headquarters
of
the
german
intelligence
section
of
the
northern
district
all
day
long
officers
went
in
and
out
and
by
day
and
night
there
were
always
sentries
at
the
door
yet
it
was
there
that
was
established
also
the
headquarters
of
the
rescue
committee
it
was
on
account
of
her
irish
name
and
parentage
that
eileen
was
permitted
to
remain
in
the
two
rooms
to
the
left
of
the
courtyard
entered
by
a
separate
door
the
german
kommandant
was
a
man
who
firmly
believed
that
the
irish
nation
was
ready
to
break
out
into
revolt
against
the
english
and
that
all
irish
men
and
women
hated
the
british
empire
as
much
as
any
prussian
eileen
played
up
to
this
saw
the
value
of
it
as
a
wonderful
means
of
camouflage
lent
the
kommandant
books
on
irish
history
dealing
with
the
injustice
of
england
to
ireland
in
which
she
firmly
believed
as
a
staunch
nationalist
and
educated
him
so
completely
to
the
belief
that
she
was
as
she
was
in
politics
though
not
in
war
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
her
here
the
reverend
mother
made
a
remark
which
seemed
to
illuminate
eileen
story
as
well
as
her
own
knowledge
of
human
nature
child
has
beautiful
eyes
and
a
most
sweet
grace
irish
history
may
not
account
for
german
kommandant
i
asked
sort
of
a
man
was
he
a
german
not
altogether
bad
said
the
reverend
mother
and
ruthless
like
them
all
but
polite
when
there
was
no
occasion
to
be
violent
he
was
of
good
family
as
far
as
there
are
such
things
in
germany
a
man
of
eileen
with
german
permission
continued
her
work
as
art
mistress
at
the
de
jeunes
after
six
months
she
was
permitted
to
receive
private
pupils
in
her
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
intelligence
headquarters
in
the
same
courtyard
though
not
in
the
same
building
her
pupils
came
with
and
they
were
all
girls
with
pigtails
and
short
frocks
not
so
young
as
they
looked
because
three
or
four
at
least
including
the
baronne
de
were
older
than
schoolgirls
they
played
the
part
perfectly
and
the
sentries
smiled
at
them
and
said
tag
schönes
as
each
one
passed
they
were
the
committee
of
the
rescue
society
julienne
de
quesnoy
marcelle
barbier
yvonne
marigny
marguérite
cléry
and
alice
de
taffin
de
eileen
was
the
director
and
leading
spirit
it
seems
to
me
astonishing
that
they
should
have
arranged
the
cypher
practised
it
written
down
military
information
gathered
from
german
conversations
and
reported
to
them
by
servants
and
agents
under
the
very
noses
of
the
german
intelligence
officers
who
could
see
into
the
as
they
passed
through
french
windows
and
saluted
eileen
and
her
young
ladies
if
they
happened
to
meet
their
eyes
it
is
more
astonishing
that
at
different
times
and
one
at
a
time
many
fugitives
including
five
british
soldiers
who
had
escaped
from
the
citadel
slept
in
the
cellar
beneath
that
room
changed
into
german
uniforms
belonging
to
men
who
had
died
at
the
convent
hospital
the
reverend
mother
did
that
part
of
the
plot
and
walked
quietly
out
in
the
morning
by
an
underground
passage
leading
to
the
jardin
the
passage
had
been
anciently
built
but
was
blocked
up
at
one
end
by
eileen
cellar
and
she
and
the
other
women
broke
the
wall
one
brick
at
a
time
until
after
three
months
the
hole
was
made
their
suffered
in
the
process
and
they
were
afraid
that
the
roughness
of
their
hands
might
be
noticed
by
the
officers
but
in
spite
of
german
spectacles
they
saw
nothing
of
that
eileen
and
her
friends
were
in
constant
touch
with
the
prisoners
of
the
citadel
and
smuggled
food
to
them
that
was
easy
it
was
done
by
bribing
the
german
sentries
with
tobacco
and
they
were
also
in
communication
with
other
branches
of
the
work
in
belgium
so
that
fugitives
were
passed
on
from
town
to
town
and
house
to
house
their
success
made
them
confident
after
many
horrible
fears
and
for
a
time
they
were
lulled
into
a
sense
of
security
that
was
rudely
crashed
when
eileen
the
young
baronne
de
and
marcelle
barbier
were
arrested
one
morning
in
september
of
on
a
charge
of
espionage
they
were
put
into
separate
cells
of
the
civil
prison
crowded
with
the
vilest
women
of
the
slums
and
stews
and
suffered
something
like
torture
because
of
the
foul
atmosphere
the
lack
of
sanitation
and
unspeakable
abomination
the
spirit
of
christian
martyrdom
could
remain
cheerful
in
such
terrible
conditions
said
the
reverend
mother
dear
eileen
was
sustained
by
a
great
faith
and
wonderful
gaiety
her
laughter
her
jokes
her
patience
her
courage
were
an
inspiration
even
to
the
poor
degraded
women
who
were
prisoners
with
her
they
worshipped
her
we
her
friends
gave
her
up
for
lost
though
we
prayed
unceasingly
that
she
might
escape
death
then
she
was
brought
to
she
stood
alone
in
the
court
the
young
baronne
de
had
died
in
prison
owing
to
the
shock
of
her
arrest
and
a
weak
heart
a
weak
heart
though
so
brave
eileen
was
not
allowed
to
see
her
on
her
deathbed
but
she
sent
a
message
almost
with
her
last
breath
it
was
the
one
word
mlle
marcelle
barbier
was
released
before
the
trial
for
lack
of
direct
evidence
trial
was
famous
in
lille
the
court
was
crowded
and
the
german
military
tribunal
could
not
suppress
the
loud
expressions
of
sympathy
and
admiration
which
greeted
her
nor
the
angry
murmurs
which
interrupted
the
prosecuting
officer
she
stood
there
wonderfully
calm
between
two
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
she
looked
very
young
and
innocent
between
her
guards
and
it
is
evident
that
her
appearance
made
a
favourable
impression
on
the
court
the
president
after
peering
at
her
through
his
horn
spectacles
was
not
so
ferocious
in
his
manner
as
usual
when
he
bade
her
be
seated
the
evidence
seemed
very
strong
against
her
is
was
the
belief
of
all
her
friends
in
court
one
of
the
sentries
at
the
citadel
jealously
savage
because
another
man
had
received
more
tobacco
than
himself
on
such
a
trivial
thing
did
this
life
hang
betrayed
the
system
by
which
the
committee
sent
food
to
the
french
and
english
prisoners
he
gave
the
names
of
three
of
the
ladies
and
described
eileen
as
the
ringleader
the
secret
police
watched
her
and
searched
her
rooms
at
night
they
discovered
the
cypher
and
the
key
a
list
of
men
who
had
escaped
and
three
german
uniforms
in
a
secret
cupboard
they
had
been
aided
in
their
search
by
lieutenant
franz
von
kreuzenach
of
the
intelligence
bureau
who
was
the
chief
witness
for
the
prosecution
and
whose
name
was
recommended
to
the
court
for
the
vigilance
and
zeal
he
had
shown
in
the
detection
of
the
conspiracy
against
the
army
and
the
fatherland
it
was
he
who
had
found
the
secret
cupboard
and
had
solved
the
key
to
the
cypher
will
take
the
evidence
in
due
course
said
the
president
that
complete
the
indictment
against
this
prisoner
apart
from
a
savage
elaboration
of
evidence
based
upon
the
facts
presented
and
a
demand
that
the
guilt
if
the
court
were
satisfied
thereof
should
be
punished
by
death
the
preliminary
indictment
by
the
prosecution
ended
it
was
a
terrible
case
and
during
its
revelations
the
people
in
court
were
stricken
with
dread
and
pity
for
the
girl
who
was
now
sitting
between
the
two
soldiers
they
were
all
staring
at
her
and
some
at
least
the
reverend
mother
among
them
noticed
with
surprise
that
when
the
officer
for
the
prosecution
ended
his
speech
she
drew
a
deep
breath
raised
her
head
as
though
some
weight
of
fear
had
been
lifted
from
her
and
laughed
it
was
quite
a
merry
laugh
with
that
full
blackbird
note
of
hers
and
the
sound
of
it
caused
a
strange
sensation
in
the
court
the
president
blinked
repeatedly
like
an
owl
blinded
by
a
ray
of
sunlight
he
addressed
the
prisoner
in
heavy
barbarous
french
are
charged
with
conspiracy
against
our
german
martial
law
the
punishment
is
death
it
is
no
laughing
matter
they
were
stem
words
but
there
was
a
touch
of
pity
in
that
last
sentence
riest
pas
une
affaire
pour
rire
eileen
said
the
reverend
mother
who
was
to
be
called
as
a
witness
on
her
behalf
bowed
in
a
gracious
way
to
the
president
but
with
a
look
of
amusement
that
was
amazing
to
the
german
officers
assembled
for
her
trial
some
of
them
scowled
but
there
were
others
the
younger
men
who
whispered
and
smiled
also
with
no
attempt
to
disguise
their
admiration
of
such
courage
it
was
only
i
said
the
reverend
mother
understood
the
joyous
relief
which
gave
her
this
courage
i
had
waited
with
terrible
dread
for
the
announcement
of
the
discovery
of
the
secret
passage
that
it
had
been
discovered
i
knew
for
the
german
lieutenant
franz
von
kreuzenach
had
come
round
to
me
and
very
sternly
questioned
me
about
a
case
of
medicine
which
he
had
found
there
stamped
with
the
name
of
our
i
said
franz
von
kreuzenach
must
have
suppressed
some
of
the
evidence
by
what
motive
the
reverend
mother
interrupted
me
putting
her
hand
on
my
sleeve
with
a
touch
of
protest
good
god
works
through
strange
instruments
and
may
touch
the
hardest
heart
with
his
grace
it
was
indeed
a
i
would
give
much
to
have
been
in
that
court
at
lille
when
eileen
was
permitted
to
question
the
german
lieutenant
who
was
the
chief
witness
against
her
from
what
i
have
heard
not
only
from
the
reverend
mother
but
from
other
people
of
lille
who
were
present
at
the
trial
she
played
with
this
german
officer
making
him
look
very
foolish
ridiculing
him
in
a
merry
contemptuous
way
before
the
court
indeed
he
seemed
strangely
abashed
before
her
cypher
have
you
ever
been
a
schoolboy
or
were
you
born
a
lieutenant
in
the
german
army
franz
von
kreuzenach
admitted
that
he
had
once
been
a
boy
to
the
amusement
of
his
brother
officers
had
he
ever
read
stories
of
adventure
fairy
tales
romances
or
did
he
spend
his
childhood
in
the
study
of
nietzsche
haegel
schopenhauer
kant
goethe
von
bemhardi
karl
marx
when
she
strung
off
these
names
so
incongruous
in
association
even
the
president
permitted
a
slight
smile
to
twist
his
thin
hard
mouth
franz
von
kreuzenach
said
that
he
had
read
some
fairy
tales
and
stories
of
adventure
might
he
ask
the
said
the
president
has
this
to
do
with
your
case
fràulein
i
desire
to
give
you
full
liberty
in
your
defence
but
this
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
is
my
case
cried
miss
to
the
next
question
herr
president
it
is
the
key
of
my
her
next
question
caused
laughter
in
court
ask
the
herr
lieutenant
whether
as
a
boy
or
a
young
man
he
has
read
the
romances
of
the
french
writer
jules
verne
franz
von
kreuzenach
looked
abashed
and
blushed
like
a
schoolboy
his
eyes
fell
before
the
challenging
look
of
the
irish
girl
have
read
some
novels
by
jules
verne
in
german
in
german
translations
of
course
said
miss
boys
do
not
learn
french
very
to
the
case
said
the
president
name
fraulein
what
has
this
to
do
with
your
defence
she
raised
her
hand
for
patience
and
said
president
my
innocence
will
soon
be
she
demanded
of
the
witness
for
the
prosecution
whether
he
had
ever
read
the
novel
by
jules
verne
called
he
said
that
he
had
read
it
only
a
few
days
ago
he
had
discovered
it
in
her
room
eileen
turned
round
eagerly
to
the
president
demand
the
production
of
that
an
orderly
was
sent
to
the
rooms
to
fetch
it
it
was
clear
that
the
president
of
the
court
made
a
black
mark
against
franz
von
kreuzenach
for
not
having
mentioned
its
discovery
to
the
court
as
yet
however
he
could
not
see
the
bearing
of
it
on
the
case
then
with
the
book
in
her
hand
eileen
turned
to
the
famous
cryptogram
showed
how
it
corresponded
exactly
with
her
own
cypher
proved
that
the
pieces
of
paper
found
in
her
rooms
were
copies
of
the
jules
verne
cypher
in
the
handwriting
of
her
pupils
see
herr
president
she
cried
eagerly
the
president
admitted
that
this
was
proved
but
as
he
asked
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
for
what
purpose
had
they
copied
out
that
cypher
cyphers
were
dangerous
things
to
write
in
time
of
war
deadly
things
why
did
these
ladies
want
to
learn
the
cypher
it
was
then
that
eileen
was
most
brilliant
she
described
in
a
simple
and
girlish
way
how
she
and
her
pupils
worked
in
their
little
room
while
they
copied
freehand
models
one
of
them
read
out
to
the
others
books
of
romance
love
adventure
to
forget
the
gloom
of
life
and
the
tragedy
of
war
one
of
those
books
was
jules
it
had
fascinated
them
it
had
made
them
forget
the
misery
of
war
they
were
romantic
girls
imaginative
girls
out
of
sheer
merriment
to
pass
the
hours
they
had
tried
to
work
out
the
cypher
they
had
written
to
imaginary
young
men
in
those
secret
numbers
here
eileen
smiling
ironically
read
out
specimens
of
the
letters
that
had
been
found
to
the
corner
of
the
rue
esquermoise
at
you
will
know
me
because
i
shall
be
wearing
a
blue
bow
in
a
black
that
was
the
romantic
imagination
of
the
baronne
de
you
see
a
lady
standing
outside
the
jardin
with
a
little
brown
dog
speak
to
her
in
french
and
say
il
fait
froid
if
she
answers
ne
vous
comprends
pas
you
will
understand
that
she
is
to
be
trusted
and
you
must
follow
that
was
a
romantic
idea
to
which
eileen
herself
pleaded
guilty
president
said
eileen
can
not
put
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
even
in
time
of
war
a
party
of
girls
will
let
their
foolish
little
minds
run
upon
ideas
of
love
even
when
the
sound
of
guns
is
not
far
away
you
herr
president
will
understand
that
perhaps
there
was
something
in
the
character
of
the
president
that
made
this
a
chance
hit
all
the
german
officers
laughed
and
the
president
shifted
in
his
seat
and
flushed
to
the
top
of
his
bald
head
the
possession
of
those
german
uniforms
was
also
explained
in
the
prettiest
way
by
eileen
they
were
uniforms
belonging
to
three
handsome
young
german
soldiers
who
had
died
in
hospital
they
had
kept
them
to
return
to
their
mothers
after
the
war
those
poor
german
mothers
who
were
weeping
for
their
sons
this
part
of
her
defence
touched
the
german
officers
deeply
one
of
them
had
tears
in
his
eyes
the
list
of
escaped
fugitives
was
harder
to
explain
but
again
an
irish
imagination
succeeded
in
giving
it
an
innocent
significance
it
had
been
compiled
by
a
prisoner
in
the
citadel
and
given
to
eileen
as
a
proof
that
his
own
hope
of
escape
was
not
in
vain
though
she
had
warned
him
of
the
fearful
risk
poor
man
gave
me
the
list
in
sheer
simplicity
and
in
innocence
i
kept
simply
and
touchingly
she
admitted
her
guilt
in
smuggling
food
to
french
and
british
prisoners
and
to
german
sentries
and
claimed
that
her
fault
was
only
against
military
regulations
but
in
humanity
was
justified
am
irish
she
said
have
in
my
heart
the
remembrance
of
english
crimes
to
ireland
old
unforgettable
crimes
that
still
cry
out
for
the
justice
and
the
liberty
which
are
denied
my
some
of
the
younger
german
officers
shook
their
heads
approvingly
they
liked
this
irish
hatred
of
england
it
was
according
to
their
said
the
irish
girl
sufferings
of
english
prisoners
you
know
here
of
their
misery
their
hunger
their
weakness
in
that
citadel
where
many
have
died
and
are
dying
stirred
my
compassion
as
a
woman
to
whom
all
cruelty
is
tragic
and
all
suffering
of
men
a
call
to
that
which
is
in
the
spirit
of
all
their
womanhood
as
you
know
by
your
german
women
as
i
hope
you
know
because
they
were
starved
i
tried
to
get
them
food
as
i
would
to
starving
dogs
or
any
poor
creatures
caught
in
the
trap
of
war
or
of
sport
to
that
i
confess
guilty
with
gladness
in
my
the
reverend
mother
standing
there
in
the
whitewashed
corridor
of
the
convent
in
the
flickering
light
of
an
oil
lantern
which
gleamed
on
the
white
ruff
round
her
neck
and
the
silver
cross
on
her
breast
though
her
face
was
shadowed
in
the
cavern
of
her
black
headdress
repeated
this
speech
of
eileen
as
though
in
hearing
it
first
she
had
learnt
it
by
heart
child
was
divinely
inspired
monsieur
our
lady
stood
by
her
side
prompting
her
i
am
sure
of
the
trial
lengthened
out
until
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
the
judge
summed
up
he
spoke
again
of
the
gravity
of
the
accusation
the
dread
punishment
that
must
befall
the
prisoner
if
her
guilt
were
proved
the
weight
of
evidence
against
her
for
a
time
he
seemed
to
press
her
guilt
heavily
and
the
court
was
gloomy
the
german
officers
looked
grave
one
thing
happened
in
the
course
of
his
speech
which
affected
the
audience
profoundly
it
was
when
he
spoke
of
the
romantic
explanation
that
had
been
offered
by
the
prisoner
regarding
the
secret
cypher
lady
he
said
me
to
believe
that
she
and
her
companions
were
playing
a
simple
girlish
game
of
writing
imaginary
letters
to
mythical
persons
were
these
young
ladies
nay
is
she
herself
so
lacking
in
charm
that
she
has
no
living
man
to
love
her
and
needs
must
write
fictitious
notes
to
nonexistent
men
the
president
said
these
words
with
portentous
solemnity
perhaps
only
a
german
could
have
spoken
them
he
paused
and
blinked
at
the
german
officers
below
him
suddenly
into
the
silence
of
the
court
came
a
ripple
of
laughter
clear
and
full
of
most
mirthful
significance
eileen
laugh
bewitched
the
crowded
court
and
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
in
which
all
the
officers
joined
by
that
laugh
more
even
than
by
her
general
gaiety
her
courage
and
eloquence
she
won
her
life
said
a
decade
of
the
rosary
to
our
blessed
lady
said
the
reverend
mother
thanked
god
that
this
dear
life
would
not
be
taken
i
was
certain
that
those
men
would
not
condemn
her
to
death
she
was
acquitted
on
the
charge
of
espionage
and
sentenced
to
two
imprisonment
for
smuggling
food
to
prisoners
by
a
verdict
of
seven
against
three
only
when
she
left
the
court
did
she
fall
into
so
deep
a
swoon
that
for
a
little
while
we
thought
her
the
reverend
mother
had
told
her
story
well
she
held
me
in
a
deep
strained
interest
it
was
rather
to
myself
than
to
her
that
i
spoke
the
words
which
were
my
comment
at
the
end
of
this
narrative
splendid
but
i
am
puzzled
about
that
german
lieutenant
franz
von
kreuzenach
he
kept
the
real
evidence
said
the
reverend
mother
solemnly
a
great
mystery
and
a
wickham
brand
joined
us
in
the
passage
with
eileen
by
his
side
gone
yet
said
wickham
have
been
listening
to
the
tale
of
a
courage
i
said
and
when
eileen
gave
me
her
hand
i
raised
it
to
my
lips
in
the
french
style
though
not
in
gallantry
mother
she
said
been
exalting
me
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
her
dear
on
my
way
back
to
mess
i
told
him
all
i
had
heard
about
trial
and
i
remember
his
enthusiasm
thank
heaven
there
are
women
like
that
in
this
world
it
saves
one
from
absolute
he
made
no
comment
about
the
suppression
of
evidence
which
was
a
puzzle
to
me
we
parted
with
a
long
old
man
outside
his
headquarters
and
i
did
not
see
him
until
a
few
days
later
x
it
was
frederick
small
the
american
doctor
attached
to
crowd
who
was
with
me
on
a
night
in
lille
before
the
armistice
when
by
news
from
the
colonel
we
were
stirred
by
the
tremendous
hope
almost
a
certainty
that
the
end
of
the
war
was
near
i
had
been
into
courtrai
which
the
enemy
had
first
evacuated
and
then
was
shelling
it
was
not
a
joyous
entry
like
that
into
lille
most
of
the
people
were
still
down
in
their
cellars
where
for
several
days
they
had
been
herded
together
until
the
air
became
foul
on
the
outskirts
i
had
passed
many
groups
of
peasants
with
their
babies
and
old
people
trudging
past
our
guns
trekking
from
one
village
to
another
in
search
of
greater
safety
or
standing
in
the
fields
where
our
artillery
was
getting
into
action
and
where
new
shell
craters
should
have
warned
them
away
if
they
had
had
more
knowledge
of
war
for
more
than
four
years
i
had
seen
at
different
periods
crowds
like
that
after
the
first
flight
of
fugitives
in
august
of
when
the
world
seemed
to
have
been
tilted
up
and
great
populations
in
france
and
belgium
were
in
retreat
from
the
advancing
edge
of
war
i
knew
the
types
the
attitudes
the
very
shape
of
the
bundles
in
these
refugee
processions
the
haggard
look
of
the
mothers
pushing
their
perambulators
the
bewildered
look
of
old
men
and
women
the
tired
sleepy
look
of
small
boys
and
girls
the
stumbling
look
of
old
farm
horses
dragging
carts
piled
high
with
cottage
furniture
as
it
was
at
the
beginning
so
it
was
at
the
end
for
civilians
caught
in
the
fires
of
war
with
two
other
men
i
went
into
the
heart
of
courtrai
and
found
it
desolate
and
knew
the
reason
why
when
at
the
corner
of
the
grande
place
a
heavy
shell
came
howling
and
burst
inside
a
house
with
frightful
explosive
noise
followed
by
a
crash
of
masonry
the
people
were
wise
to
keep
to
their
cellars
two
girls
not
so
wise
made
a
dash
from
one
house
to
another
and
were
caught
by
chunks
of
steel
and
killed
close
to
the
church
of
martin
where
they
lay
all
crumpled
up
in
a
clotted
pool
of
blood
a
man
came
up
to
me
utterly
careless
of
such
risks
and
i
hated
to
stand
talking
to
him
with
the
shells
coming
every
overhead
there
was
a
fire
of
passion
in
his
eyes
and
at
every
sentence
he
spoke
to
me
his
voice
rose
and
thrilled
as
he
denounced
the
german
race
for
all
they
had
done
in
courtrai
for
their
robberies
their
imprisonments
their
destruction
of
machinery
their
brutality
the
last
kommandant
of
courtrai
was
von
richthofen
father
of
the
german
aviator
and
he
was
a
hard
ruthless
man
and
kept
the
city
under
an
iron
rule
that
thank
god
is
finished
now
said
the
man
english
have
delivered
us
from
the
beast
as
he
spoke
another
monstrous
shell
came
overhead
but
he
took
no
notice
of
it
and
said
are
safe
now
from
the
evil
power
it
seemed
to
me
a
comparative
kind
of
safety
i
had
no
confidence
in
it
when
i
sat
in
the
parlour
of
an
old
lady
who
like
eileen
in
lille
had
been
an
irish
governess
in
courtrai
and
who
now
living
in
miserable
poverty
sat
in
a
whose
windows
and
woodwork
had
been
broken
by
you
mind
shutting
the
door
my
dear
she
said
bear
those
nasty
i
realised
with
a
large
experienced
knowledge
that
we
might
be
torn
to
fragments
of
flesh
at
any
moment
by
one
of
those
nasty
which
were
really
shells
but
the
old
lady
did
not
worry
and
felt
safe
when
the
door
was
shut
outside
courtrai
when
i
left
lay
some
khaki
figures
in
a
mush
of
blood
they
were
lads
whom
i
had
seen
unloading
ammunition
that
morning
on
the
bank
of
the
canal
one
had
asked
me
for
a
light
and
said
all
this
peace
talk
any
chance
a
big
chance
i
had
told
him
home
for
christmas
certain
sure
this
time
the
eyes
had
lighted
up
for
a
moment
quicker
than
the
match
which
he
held
in
the
cup
of
his
hands
back
for
good
eh
then
the
light
went
out
of
his
eyes
as
the
match
flared
up
heard
that
tale
a
score
of
times
germans
are
weakening
the
huns
enough
newspaper
talk
a
man
would
be
a
mug
now
the
boy
lay
in
the
mud
with
half
his
body
blown
away
i
was
glad
to
get
back
to
lille
for
a
spell
where
there
were
no
dead
bodies
in
the
roads
and
the
news
straight
from
which
surely
were
not
playing
up
the
old
false
optimism
again
helped
one
to
hope
that
perhaps
in
a
week
or
two
the
last
boys
of
our
race
the
lucky
ones
would
be
reprieved
from
that
kind
of
bloody
death
which
i
had
seen
so
often
so
long
so
heaped
up
in
many
fields
of
france
and
flanders
where
the
flower
of
our
youth
was
killed
small
was
excited
by
the
hope
brought
back
by
colonel
lavington
he
sought
me
out
in
my
billet
and
begged
me
to
take
a
walk
with
him
it
was
a
moonlight
night
but
no
double
throb
of
a
german
came
booming
over
lille
he
walked
at
a
hard
pace
with
the
collar
of
his
tucked
up
to
his
ears
and
talked
in
a
queer
disjointed
monologue
emotionally
whimsically
i
remember
some
of
his
words
more
or
less
anyhow
the
gist
of
his
thoughts
not
worrying
any
more
about
how
the
war
will
end
won
remarkable
that
when
one
thinks
back
to
the
time
less
than
a
year
ago
when
the
best
thing
seemed
a
draw
thinking
about
the
future
the
world
going
to
be
afterwards
my
american
mind
the
next
job
so
to
he
thought
hard
while
we
paced
round
our
side
of
the
jardin
where
the
moonlight
made
the
bushes
glamorous
and
streaked
the
tree
trunks
with
a
silver
line
war
is
going
to
have
prodigious
effects
on
nations
on
individuals
too
scared
all
been
screwed
up
to
an
intense
pitch
every
nerve
in
us
is
beyond
the
normal
stretch
of
nature
after
the
war
there
will
be
a
sudden
relaxing
we
shall
be
like
bits
of
chewed
elastic
rather
like
people
who
have
drugged
themselves
to
get
through
some
big
ordeal
after
the
ordeal
their
nerves
are
all
ragged
they
crave
the
old
stimulus
though
they
dread
it
depressed
know
the
matter
get
into
sudden
rages
hysterical
settle
to
work
go
out
for
gaiety
and
get
bored
seen
it
many
times
in
bad
cases
europe
yes
and
america
too
is
going
to
be
a
bad
case
a
neurotic
world
lord
take
some
healing
for
a
time
his
thoughts
wandered
round
the
possible
terms
of
peace
and
the
abasement
of
germany
he
prophesied
the
of
germany
the
downfall
of
the
emperor
and
of
other
thrones
will
be
as
cheap
as
twenty
cents
he
said
he
hoped
for
the
complete
overthrow
of
junkerdom
the
dirty
dogs
as
he
called
the
prussian
war
lords
and
politicians
but
he
hoped
the
allies
would
be
generous
with
the
enemy
peoples
was
the
word
he
used
must
help
the
spirit
of
democracy
to
rise
among
them
he
said
must
make
it
easy
for
them
to
exorcise
the
devil
if
we
press
them
too
hard
put
the
screw
on
to
the
torture
of
their
souls
defeat
will
be
torture
to
a
proud
people
they
will
nourish
a
hope
of
vengeance
and
go
back
to
their
devil
for
i
asked
him
whether
he
thought
his
president
would
lead
the
world
to
a
nobler
stage
of
history
he
hesitated
at
that
groped
a
little
i
thought
among
old
memories
and
prejudices
he
said
has
the
biggest
chance
that
ever
came
to
a
human
being
the
biggest
chance
and
the
biggest
duty
we
are
rich
too
darned
rich
and
enormously
powerful
when
most
other
peoples
are
poor
and
weak
drained
of
wealth
and
blood
our
luck
and
a
little
bit
perhaps
our
shame
though
our
boys
have
done
their
bit
all
right
and
are
ready
to
do
more
and
not
their
fault
they
here
before
but
hardly
touched
by
this
war
as
a
people
except
spiritually
there
been
touched
by
the
finger
of
fate
god
if
you
like
that
better
so
with
that
strength
behind
him
the
president
is
in
a
big
way
of
business
he
can
make
his
voice
heard
stand
for
a
big
idea
god
sonny
i
hope
do
it
for
the
sake
for
the
sake
of
all
these
suffering
people
here
in
this
city
of
lille
and
in
a
million
little
towns
where
people
have
been
bashed
by
i
asked
him
if
he
doubted
greatness
and
the
question
embarrassed
him
loyal
to
the
man
he
said
back
him
if
he
plays
straight
and
big
bigness
what
we
want
bigness
of
heart
as
well
as
bigness
of
brain
oh
clever
though
not
wise
in
making
so
many
enemies
he
has
fine
ideas
and
can
write
real
words
things
which
speak
true
things
like
to
be
sure
of
his
character
its
breadth
and
strength
i
mean
the
world
wants
a
nobleman
bigger
than
the
little
gentlemen
of
politics
a
leader
calling
to
the
great
human
heart
of
our
tribes
and
lifting
them
with
one
grand
gesture
out
of
the
mire
of
old
passions
and
vendettas
and
jealousies
to
a
higher
plane
of
common
sense
out
of
the
jungle
to
the
daylight
of
fellowship
out
of
the
he
repeated
those
words
twice
with
a
reverent
solemnity
he
believed
that
so
much
emotion
had
been
created
in
the
heart
of
the
world
that
when
the
war
ended
anything
might
happen
if
a
leader
came
a
new
religion
of
civilisation
any
kind
of
spiritual
and
social
revolution
might
kill
cruelty
he
said
word
what
a
victory
that
would
be
xi
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
figure
that
slipped
out
of
the
darkness
of
some
doorway
hesitated
before
us
and
then
spoke
in
french
are
english
officers
may
i
speak
with
you
it
was
a
girl
whom
i
could
see
only
vaguely
in
the
darkness
she
stood
in
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
beyond
the
moonlight
and
i
answered
her
that
i
was
english
and
my
friend
american
there
any
way
she
asked
travelling
from
lille
perhaps
to
paris
in
a
motor
car
for
example
i
laughed
at
this
startling
request
put
so
abruptly
it
was
already
nine
at
night
the
smallest
chance
in
the
world
mademoiselle
paris
is
far
from
was
stupid
said
the
girl
all
the
way
to
paris
but
to
some
town
outside
lille
any
town
there
are
motor
cars
always
passing
through
the
streets
i
thought
if
i
could
get
a
little
place
in
one
is
difficult
i
said
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
forbidden
for
officers
to
take
civilians
except
in
case
of
saving
them
from
danger
in
shelled
she
came
suddenly
out
of
the
shadow
into
the
moonlight
and
i
saw
that
she
was
a
girl
with
red
hair
and
a
face
strangely
white
i
knew
by
the
way
she
spoke
the
accent
as
well
as
by
the
neatness
of
her
dress
that
she
was
not
a
she
was
trembling
painfully
and
took
hold
of
my
arm
with
both
her
hands
i
beg
of
you
to
help
me
i
beseech
you
to
think
of
some
way
in
which
i
may
get
away
from
lille
it
is
a
matter
of
extreme
importance
to
a
group
of
young
men
and
women
came
up
the
street
shouting
laughing
singing
the
they
were
civilians
with
two
of
our
soldiers
among
them
wearing
hats
before
i
could
answer
the
last
words
she
made
a
sudden
retreat
into
the
dark
doorway
and
i
could
see
dimly
that
she
was
cowering
back
small
spoke
to
me
girl
is
scared
of
something
the
poor
child
has
got
the
i
went
closer
to
her
and
heard
her
breathing
it
was
quite
loud
it
was
as
though
she
were
panting
after
hard
running
you
ill
i
asked
she
did
not
answer
until
the
group
of
civilians
had
passed
they
did
not
pass
at
once
but
stood
for
a
moment
looking
up
at
a
light
burning
in
an
upper
window
one
of
the
men
shouted
something
in
a
loud
voice
some
word
in
which
i
did
not
understand
and
the
women
screeched
with
laughter
then
they
went
on
dancing
with
linked
arms
and
our
two
soldiers
in
the
hats
lurched
along
with
them
am
afraid
said
the
girl
of
what
i
asked
i
repeated
the
question
are
you
afraid
mademoiselle
and
she
answered
by
words
which
i
had
heard
a
million
times
since
the
war
began
as
an
explanation
of
all
trouble
tears
ruin
misery
la
guerre
out
said
the
little
doctor
she
had
risen
from
her
cowering
position
and
stood
upright
for
a
moment
with
her
hand
against
the
doorpost
then
she
swayed
and
would
have
fallen
if
the
doctor
had
not
caught
her
even
then
she
fell
indeed
though
without
hurt
because
he
could
not
support
her
sudden
weight
though
she
was
of
slight
build
and
they
sank
together
in
a
kind
of
huddle
on
the
doorstep
the
love
of
mike
said
small
he
was
on
his
knees
before
her
now
chafing
her
cold
hands
she
came
to
in
about
a
minute
and
i
leaned
over
her
and
asked
her
where
she
lived
and
made
out
from
her
faint
whisper
that
she
lived
in
the
house
to
which
this
doorway
belonged
in
the
upper
room
where
the
light
was
burning
with
numbed
fingers
as
a
toad
said
small
she
fumbled
at
her
bodice
and
drew
out
a
latchkey
had
better
carry
her
up
i
said
and
the
doctor
nodded
the
front
door
opened
into
a
passage
uncarpeted
and
with
walls
at
one
end
was
a
staircase
with
heavy
banisters
the
doctor
and
i
supported
the
girl
who
was
able
to
walk
a
little
now
and
managed
to
get
her
to
the
first
landing
i
asked
and
she
said
it
was
the
front
room
looking
on
to
the
street
a
lamp
was
burning
on
the
round
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
i
saw
by
the
light
of
it
the
poverty
of
the
furniture
and
its
untidiness
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
big
iron
bedstead
with
curtains
of
torn
lace
and
on
the
wooden
chairs
hung
some
soiled
petticoats
and
blouses
there
was
a
small
in
a
corner
but
no
charcoal
burned
in
it
and
i
remember
an
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
i
remember
that
mirror
vividly
i
remember
for
instance
that
a
bit
of
the
ebony
had
broken
off
showing
the
white
plaster
underneath
and
a
crack
in
the
corner
of
the
probably
my
eyes
were
attracted
to
it
because
of
a
number
of
photographs
stuck
into
the
framework
they
were
photographs
of
a
girl
in
a
variety
of
stage
costumes
and
glancing
at
the
girl
whom
the
doctor
had
put
into
a
low
i
saw
that
they
were
of
her
but
with
all
the
tragic
difference
between
happiness
and
misery
worse
than
that
between
unscathed
girlhood
and
haggard
womanhood
this
girl
with
red
hair
and
a
white
waxen
face
was
pretty
still
there
was
something
more
than
prettiness
in
the
broadness
of
her
brow
and
the
long
tawny
lashes
that
were
now
veiling
her
closed
eyes
as
she
sat
with
her
head
back
against
the
chair
showing
a
long
white
throat
but
her
face
was
lined
with
an
imprint
of
pain
and
her
mouth
rather
long
and
was
drawn
with
a
look
of
misery
the
doctor
spoke
to
me
in
english
of
course
i
should
say
or
he
sniffed
at
the
stove
and
the
room
generally
sign
of
recent
he
opened
a
cupboard
and
looked
in
in
the
pantry
sonny
i
guess
the
girl
would
do
with
a
i
did
not
answer
him
i
was
staring
at
the
photographs
stuck
into
the
mirror
and
saw
one
that
was
not
a
portrait
it
was
the
photograph
of
a
young
french
lieutenant
i
crossed
the
room
and
looked
at
it
closer
and
then
spoke
to
the
little
doctor
in
a
curiously
unexcited
voice
as
one
does
in
moments
of
living
drama
girl
is
pierre
the
love
of
mike
said
the
little
doctor
for
the
second
time
that
night
the
girl
heard
the
name
of
pierre
nesle
and
opened
her
eyes
wide
with
a
wondering
look
nesle
that
is
my
brother
do
you
know
him
i
told
her
that
i
knew
him
well
and
had
seen
him
in
lille
where
he
was
looking
for
her
two
days
ago
he
was
now
in
the
direction
of
courtrai
the
girl
was
painfully
agitated
and
uttered
pitiful
words
my
little
brother
she
murmured
dear
little
comrade
she
rose
from
her
chair
steadying
herself
with
one
hand
on
the
back
of
it
and
with
feverish
anxiety
said
that
she
must
go
at
once
she
must
leave
lille
i
asked
do
you
want
to
leave
lille
am
afraid
she
answered
again
and
burst
into
tears
i
turned
to
the
doctor
and
translated
her
words
understand
this
fear
of
hers
this
desire
to
leave
small
had
taken
something
off
the
mantelpiece
a
glass
tube
with
some
tablets
which
he
put
in
his
pocket
he
said
and
drugs
a
jolly
combination
for
a
young
nerves
afraid
of
herself
old
ghosts
the
horrors
wants
to
run
away
from
it
all
forgetting
that
she
carries
her
poor
body
and
brain
with
her
i
know
the
symptoms
even
in
little
old
new
york
in
time
of
he
had
his
professional
manner
i
saw
the
doctor
through
his
uniform
he
spoke
with
the
authority
of
the
medical
man
in
a
bedroom
he
ordered
me
to
go
round
to
my
mess
and
bring
back
some
food
while
he
boiled
up
a
kettle
and
got
busy
when
i
returned
after
the
girl
was
more
cheerful
some
of
the
horrors
had
passed
from
her
in
the
company
she
ate
some
of
the
food
i
had
brought
in
a
famished
way
but
after
a
few
mouthfuls
sickened
at
it
and
would
eat
no
more
but
a
faint
colour
had
come
into
her
cheeks
and
gave
her
face
a
touch
of
real
beauty
she
must
have
been
extraordinarily
attractive
before
the
war
as
those
photographs
showed
she
spoke
of
pierre
with
adoration
he
had
been
all
that
was
good
to
her
before
she
left
home
she
hated
her
mother
to
sing
in
cabarets
and
café
concerts
can
not
imagine
pierre
as
a
lieutenant
she
remarked
with
a
queer
little
laugh
small
said
he
would
get
some
women
in
the
house
to
look
after
her
in
the
night
but
she
seemed
hostile
to
that
idea
people
here
are
unkind
they
are
bad
women
here
if
i
died
they
would
not
she
promised
to
stay
in
the
house
until
we
could
arrange
for
pierre
to
meet
her
and
take
her
away
to
paris
but
i
felt
the
greatest
pity
for
the
girl
when
we
left
her
alone
in
her
miserable
room
the
scared
look
had
come
back
to
her
face
i
could
see
that
she
was
in
terror
of
being
alone
again
when
we
walked
back
to
our
billets
the
doctor
spoke
of
the
extraordinary
chance
of
meeting
the
girl
like
that
the
sister
of
our
officer
the
odds
were
a
million
to
one
against
such
a
thing
always
feel
a
direction
in
these
cases
said
daddy
small
hand
that
guides
maybe
you
and
i
were
being
led
like
to
save
that
girl
that
her
name
de
méricourt
she
calls
herself
as
a
i
guess
why
pierre
could
not
hear
of
her
in
this
later
on
the
doctor
spoke
again
girl
is
as
much
a
war
victim
as
if
she
had
been
on
the
field
of
battle
the
casualty
lists
say
anything
about
civilians
not
a
darned
thing
about
broken
hearts
stricken
women
diseased
babies
infant
mortality
all
the
hell
of
suffering
behind
the
lines
may
god
curse
all
war
devils
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
in
a
very
solemn
way
this
thing
is
finished
this
grisly
business
you
and
i
and
all
men
of
goodwill
must
put
our
heads
together
to
prevent
it
happening
again
i
dedicate
whatever
life
i
have
to
he
seemed
to
have
a
vision
of
hope
are
lots
of
good
fellows
in
the
world
wickham
brand
is
one
of
charles
fortune
is
another
one
finds
them
everywhere
on
your
side
and
mine
surely
we
can
get
together
when
peace
comes
and
make
a
better
system
somehow
easy
he
laughed
at
me
hate
your
pessimism
we
must
get
a
message
to
pierre
nesle
sonny
on
the
way
back
to
my
billet
i
passed
young
clatworthy
he
was
too
engrossed
to
see
me
having
his
arm
round
a
girl
who
was
standing
with
him
under
an
unlighted
she
was
looking
up
into
his
face
on
which
the
moonlight
shone
a
pretty
creature
i
thought
she
murmured
as
i
passed
quite
close
and
clatworthy
kissed
her
i
knew
the
mother
and
sisters
and
wondered
what
they
would
think
of
him
if
they
saw
him
now
with
this
little
to
them
cyril
was
a
white
knight
peur
et
sans
the
war
had
not
improved
him
he
was
no
longer
the
healthy
lad
who
had
been
captain
of
his
school
with
all
his
ambition
in
sport
as
i
had
known
him
five
years
before
sometimes
in
spite
of
his
swagger
and
gallantry
i
saw
something
sinister
in
his
face
the
look
of
a
soiled
soul
poor
kid
he
too
would
have
his
excuse
for
all
things
la
guerre
xii
it
was
five
on
the
following
evening
that
i
saw
the
girl
marthe
again
the
doctor
and
i
had
arranged
to
go
round
to
her
lodging
after
dinner
by
which
time
we
hoped
to
have
a
letter
for
her
from
pierre
by
but
brand
was
with
me
in
the
afternoon
having
looked
into
my
billet
with
an
english
for
hélène
who
was
anxious
to
study
our
way
of
speech
madame
chéri
insisted
upon
giving
him
a
glass
of
wine
and
we
stood
talking
in
her
a
while
about
the
certain
hope
of
victory
and
then
trivial
things
hélène
was
delighted
with
her
book
and
brand
had
a
merry
five
minutes
with
her
teaching
her
to
pronounce
the
words
effroyable
cried
hélène
dieu
comme
difficile
there
is
no
rule
in
your
madame
chéri
spoke
of
edouard
her
eldest
boy
who
had
disappeared
into
the
great
silence
and
gave
me
a
photograph
of
him
in
case
i
should
meet
him
in
our
advance
towards
the
rhine
she
kissed
the
photograph
before
giving
it
to
me
and
said
a
few
words
which
revealed
her
strong
character
her
passionate
patriotism
he
had
been
four
years
older
he
would
have
been
a
soldier
of
france
i
should
have
been
happy
if
he
could
have
fought
for
his
country
and
died
for
it
like
my
brand
and
i
left
the
house
and
went
up
towards
the
grande
place
i
was
telling
him
about
pierre
sister
and
our
strange
meeting
with
her
the
night
before
precious
glad
said
brand
no
sister
of
mine
was
behind
german
lines
god
knows
how
much
they
had
to
endure
imagine
their
risks
it
was
a
lucky
escape
for
that
girl
hélène
supposing
she
had
failed
to
barricade
her
door
when
we
came
into
the
grande
place
we
saw
that
something
was
happening
it
was
almost
dark
after
a
shadowy
twilight
but
we
could
see
a
crowd
of
people
surging
round
some
central
point
of
interest
many
of
them
were
laughing
loudly
there
was
some
joke
in
progress
the
tongues
sounded
most
loud
and
shrill
getting
back
to
gaiety
said
brand
the
jest
i
wonder
a
gust
of
laughter
came
across
the
square
above
it
was
another
sound
not
so
pleasant
it
was
a
shrieks
shriek
after
shriek
most
and
then
becoming
faint
the
devil
said
brand
we
were
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
and
i
spoke
to
a
man
there
happening
he
laughed
in
a
grim
way
the
of
a
they
are
cutting
her
i
was
mystified
her
hair
a
woman
spoke
to
me
by
way
of
explanation
laughing
like
the
man
her
head
monsieur
she
was
one
of
those
who
were
too
complaisant
with
german
officers
you
understand
there
were
many
of
them
they
ought
to
have
their
heads
cut
off
as
well
as
their
another
man
spoke
gruffly
would
be
a
good
many
headless
corpses
if
that
were
so
to
their
shame
be
it
said
it
was
abominable
no
pride
no
the
worst
will
escape
said
another
private
houses
the
demoiselles
cried
a
woman
it
was
a
cry
for
killing
such
as
women
had
screamed
when
pretty
aristocrats
were
caught
by
the
mobs
of
the
french
revolution
god
said
brand
he
shouldered
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
i
followed
him
the
people
made
a
gap
for
us
seeing
our
uniforms
and
desired
us
to
enjoy
the
joke
what
i
saw
when
i
came
closer
was
a
group
of
young
men
holding
a
limp
figure
one
of
them
was
brandishing
a
large
pair
of
scissors
as
large
as
shears
another
held
up
a
tangled
mass
of
red
hair
he
shouted
to
the
crowd
and
they
cheered
and
laughed
i
had
seen
the
hair
before
as
i
knew
when
i
saw
a
face
lifeless
as
it
seemed
and
limp
against
a
shoulder
is
marthe
i
said
to
brand
a
curious
sense
of
faintness
overcame
me
and
i
felt
sick
brand
did
not
answer
me
but
i
saw
his
face
pale
under
its
tan
he
pushed
forward
through
the
crowd
and
i
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
few
moments
after
that
i
saw
him
carrying
the
girl
above
the
heads
of
the
people
i
saw
her
head
flopping
from
side
to
side
horribly
a
head
with
hair
they
had
torn
her
clothes
off
her
shoulders
which
were
bleeding
me
said
brand
i
am
not
quite
clear
what
happened
i
have
only
a
vague
remembrance
of
the
crowd
making
way
for
us
with
murmurs
of
surprise
and
some
hostile
cries
of
women
i
remember
helping
brand
to
carry
the
girl
enormously
heavy
she
seemed
with
her
dead
weight
but
how
we
managed
to
get
her
into
car
is
to
this
day
a
blank
in
my
mind
we
must
have
seen
and
hailed
him
at
the
corner
of
the
grande
place
as
he
was
going
back
to
his
billet
i
have
a
distinct
recollection
of
taking
off
my
burberry
and
laying
it
over
the
girl
who
was
huddled
in
the
back
of
the
car
and
of
brand
saying
can
we
take
her
i
also
remember
trying
to
light
a
cigarette
and
using
many
matches
which
went
out
in
the
wind
it
was
idea
that
we
should
go
to
madame
house
for
sanctuary
and
by
the
time
we
had
driven
to
that
place
we
had
left
the
crowd
behind
and
were
not
followed
go
in
and
explain
things
said
brand
madame
to
give
the
girl
a
i
think
madame
chéri
was
startled
by
the
sight
of
the
car
and
perhaps
by
some
queer
look
i
had
i
told
her
what
had
happened
this
girl
was
the
sister
of
pierre
nesle
whom
madame
chéri
had
met
the
crowd
for
some
reason
had
cut
off
her
hair
would
madame
save
the
poor
child
who
was
unconscious
i
shall
never
forget
the
face
or
speech
of
that
lady
whom
i
had
found
so
kind
she
drew
herself
up
very
stiffly
and
a
relentless
expression
hardened
her
face
you
were
not
english
i
should
say
you
desired
to
insult
me
sir
the
people
have
cut
off
the
hair
some
reason
you
say
there
is
only
one
reason
because
she
was
faithless
to
her
country
and
to
her
sex
and
was
familiar
with
men
who
were
the
enemies
of
france
the
murderers
of
our
men
robbers
and
assassins
she
has
been
well
punished
i
would
rather
burn
down
my
house
than
give
her
shelter
if
they
gave
her
to
the
dogs
to
tear
in
pieces
i
would
not
lift
my
little
finger
to
save
hélène
came
in
and
was
surprised
at
the
emotion
of
her
voice
is
it
little
madame
chéri
regained
control
of
herself
which
for
a
moment
she
had
lost
in
a
passion
that
shook
her
is
a
little
matter
this
officer
and
i
have
been
talking
about
vile
people
who
sold
themselves
to
our
enemy
he
understands
understand
i
said
gravely
is
a
great
deal
of
cruelty
in
the
world
madame
and
less
charity
than
i
had
is
praise
be
to
god
a
little
justice
said
madame
chéri
very
calmly
revoir
madame
revoir
monsieur
revoir
mademoiselle
i
was
shocked
then
at
the
callousness
of
the
lady
it
seemed
to
me
incredible
now
i
am
no
longer
shocked
but
understand
the
horror
that
was
hers
the
loathing
for
a
daughter
of
france
who
had
if
the
mob
were
not
mistaken
violated
the
code
of
honour
which
enabled
the
french
people
to
resist
german
brutality
even
german
kindness
which
they
hated
worse
with
a
most
proud
disdain
that
girl
outside
bleeding
and
senseless
in
the
car
had
been
friendly
with
german
officers
notorious
in
her
company
with
them
otherwise
she
would
not
have
been
seized
by
the
crowd
and
branded
for
shame
there
was
a
fierce
protective
instinct
which
hardened
madame
chéri
against
charity
only
those
who
have
seen
what
war
means
to
women
close
to
it
in
enemy
hands
may
truly
understand
and
understanding
curse
war
again
for
all
its
destruction
of
souls
and
bodies
xiii
brand
and
small
were
both
astonished
and
indignant
you
mean
to
say
she
shuts
her
door
against
this
poor
bleeding
girl
said
brand
the
american
doctor
did
not
waste
words
he
only
used
words
when
there
was
no
action
on
hand
next
place
he
said
hospital
i
had
the
idea
of
the
convent
where
eileen
lodged
there
was
a
sanctuary
those
nuns
were
vowed
to
christian
charity
they
would
understand
and
have
pity
said
brand
and
he
called
to
the
driver
we
drove
hard
to
the
convent
and
brand
was
out
of
the
car
before
it
stopped
and
rang
the
bell
with
such
a
tug
that
we
heard
it
jangling
loudly
in
the
courtyard
it
seemed
long
before
the
little
wicket
opened
and
a
voice
said
est
la
brand
gave
his
name
and
said
quickly
we
have
a
woman
here
who
is
the
gate
was
opened
and
brand
and
i
lifted
out
the
girl
who
was
still
unconscious
but
moaning
slightly
and
carried
her
into
the
courtyard
and
thence
inside
the
convent
to
the
whitewashed
passage
where
i
had
listened
so
long
to
the
reverend
mother
telling
me
of
the
trial
scene
it
was
the
reverend
mother
who
came
now
with
two
of
her
nuns
while
the
little
portress
stood
by
clasping
her
hands
accident
said
the
reverend
mother
was
the
poor
child
hurt
she
bent
over
the
girl
marthe
pierre
sister
as
i
remembered
with
an
added
pity
pulled
my
burberry
from
her
face
and
shoulders
and
glanced
at
the
bedraggled
figure
there
hair
has
been
cut
off
said
the
old
nun
is
strange
there
are
the
marks
of
on
her
shoulder
what
violence
was
it
then
brand
described
the
rescue
of
the
girl
from
the
mob
who
would
have
torn
her
to
pieces
and
as
he
spoke
i
saw
a
terrible
look
come
into
the
reverend
face
remember
she
said
harshly
cut
the
hair
of
women
who
had
disgraced
themselves
and
france
by
their
behaviour
with
german
soldiers
we
thought
then
that
it
was
a
light
punishment
we
think
so
now
monsieur
one
of
the
nuns
a
young
woman
who
had
been
touching
the
head
smoothing
back
her
tousled
hair
sprang
up
as
though
she
had
touched
an
evil
thing
and
shrank
back
another
nun
spoke
to
the
reverend
mother
house
would
be
defiled
if
we
took
in
a
creature
like
that
god
forbid
reverend
mother
the
old
superior
turned
to
brand
and
i
saw
how
her
breast
was
heaving
with
emotion
would
have
been
better
sir
if
you
had
left
this
wretched
woman
to
the
people
the
voice
of
the
people
is
sometimes
the
voice
of
god
if
they
knew
her
guilt
their
punishment
was
just
reflect
what
it
means
to
us
to
all
our
womanhood
husbands
fathers
brothers
were
being
killed
by
these
germans
our
dear
france
was
bleeding
to
death
was
there
any
greater
crime
than
that
a
frenchwoman
should
show
any
weakness
any
favour
to
one
of
those
men
who
were
helping
to
cause
the
agony
of
france
the
martyrdom
of
our
youth
brand
stammered
out
a
few
words
i
remember
only
two
charity
the
american
doctor
and
i
stood
by
silently
small
was
listening
with
the
deepest
attention
as
though
some
new
truth
about
human
nature
were
being
revealed
to
him
it
was
then
that
a
new
voice
was
raised
in
that
whitewashed
corridor
it
was
eileen
irish
contralto
and
it
vibrated
with
extraordinary
passion
as
she
spoke
in
french
mother
i
am
dismayed
by
the
words
you
have
spoken
i
do
not
believe
though
my
ears
have
heard
them
no
they
are
unbelievable
i
have
seen
your
holiness
your
charity
every
day
for
four
years
nursing
german
prisoners
and
english
with
equal
tenderness
with
a
great
pity
not
shrinking
from
any
horror
or
the
daily
sight
of
death
but
offering
it
all
as
a
sacrifice
to
god
and
now
after
our
liberation
when
we
ought
to
be
uplifted
by
the
divine
favour
that
has
come
to
us
you
would
turn
away
that
poor
child
who
lies
bleeding
at
our
feet
another
victim
of
cruelty
was
it
not
war
that
struck
her
down
this
war
which
has
been
declared
against
souls
as
well
as
bodies
this
war
on
women
as
well
as
on
who
had
less
need
of
courage
than
some
of
us
what
did
our
lord
say
to
a
woman
who
was
taken
by
the
mob
that
is
without
sin
among
you
let
him
cast
the
first
stone
it
was
mary
magdalen
who
kissed
his
feet
and
wiped
them
with
her
hair
this
girl
has
lost
her
hair
but
perhaps
christ
has
taken
it
as
a
precious
napkin
for
his
wounds
we
who
have
been
lucky
in
escape
from
evil
shall
we
cast
her
out
of
the
house
which
has
a
cross
above
its
roof
i
have
been
lucky
above
most
women
in
lille
if
all
things
were
known
i
might
be
lying
there
in
that
place
bleeding
and
senseless
without
this
hair
of
mine
reverend
mother
franz
von
kreuzenach
we
small
brand
and
i
were
dumbfounded
by
eileen
passionate
outcry
she
was
utterly
unconscious
of
us
and
looked
only
at
the
reverend
mother
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
was
more
intensely
spiritual
than
i
had
seen
before
in
any
face
the
old
nun
seemed
stricken
by
words
into
her
rugged
old
face
all
wrinkled
about
the
eyes
crept
an
expression
of
remorse
and
shame
once
she
raised
her
hands
slowly
as
though
beseeching
the
girl
to
spare
her
then
her
hands
came
down
again
and
clasped
each
other
at
her
breast
and
her
head
bowed
so
that
her
chin
was
dug
into
her
white
bib
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
fell
unheeded
down
her
withered
cheeks
i
can
see
now
the
picture
of
us
all
standing
there
in
the
whitewashed
corridor
of
the
convent
in
the
dim
light
of
a
hanging
lantern
we
three
officers
standing
together
the
huddled
figure
of
marthe
nesle
lying
at
our
feet
half
covered
with
my
but
with
her
face
lying
sideways
white
as
death
under
her
cropped
red
hair
and
her
bare
shoulders
stained
with
a
streak
of
blood
opposite
the
old
mother
with
bowed
head
and
clasped
hands
the
two
young
nuns
rigid
motionless
silent
and
eileen
with
that
queer
light
on
her
face
and
her
hands
stretched
out
with
a
gesture
of
passionate
appeal
the
reverend
mother
raised
her
head
and
spoke
after
what
seemed
like
a
long
silence
but
was
only
a
second
or
two
i
suppose
child
i
am
an
old
woman
and
have
said
many
prayers
but
you
have
taught
me
the
lesson
which
i
thought
i
knew
that
the
devil
does
not
depart
from
us
until
our
souls
have
found
eternal
peace
i
am
a
wicked
old
woman
and
until
you
opened
my
eyes
i
was
forgetful
of
charity
and
of
our
most
sweet
she
turned
to
us
now
with
an
air
of
wonderful
dignity
and
graciousness
i
pray
you
to
carry
this
wounded
girl
to
my
own
cell
i
will
sleep
on
bare
one
of
the
young
nuns
was
weeping
bitterly
so
we
lifted
up
marthe
nesle
and
following
the
reverend
mother
carried
her
to
a
little
white
room
and
laid
her
on
an
iron
bedstead
under
a
picture
of
the
madonna
below
which
burned
an
oil
lamp
on
a
wooden
table
the
american
doctor
asked
eileen
to
bring
him
some
hot
water
brand
and
i
went
back
in
the
car
and
i
dined
at
his
mess
again
xiv
colonel
lavington
was
discussing
the
art
of
the
sonnet
and
the
influence
of
italian
culture
in
elizabethan
england
from
that
subject
he
travelled
to
the
psychology
of
courage
which
in
his
opinion
for
the
moment
was
founded
on
vanity
he
said
with
that
gallant
look
of
his
which
i
had
seen
with
admiration
when
he
walked
up
the
old
duckboards
beyond
ypres
with
a
whimsical
smile
at
bursting
abominably
near
he
had
done
bravely
in
the
old
days
as
a
battalion
commander
is
merely
a
pose
before
the
mirror
of
own
soul
and
neighbours
we
are
all
horribly
afraid
in
moments
of
danger
but
some
of
us
have
the
gift
of
pretending
that
we
mind
that
is
vanity
we
like
to
look
heroes
even
to
ourselves
it
is
good
to
die
with
a
though
death
is
damnably
agree
colonel
said
charles
fortune
the
right
face
for
the
proper
occasion
but
it
wants
a
lot
of
he
put
on
his
gallant
face
and
there
was
appreciative
laughter
from
his
fellow
officers
harding
the
young
landowner
was
of
opinion
that
courage
depended
entirely
on
the
liver
is
a
matter
of
physical
health
he
said
i
am
my
goes
down
to
zero
not
that
ever
really
brave
anyhow
i
hate
things
that
go
off
those
loud
noises
of
bursting
shells
are
very
objectionable
i
shall
protest
against
christmas
crackers
after
the
young
clatworthy
was
in
the
sulks
and
sat
very
silent
during
all
this
badinage
the
matter
i
asked
and
he
confided
to
me
his
conviction
while
he
passed
the
salt
that
was
a
rummy
i
said
and
his
answer
was
up
to
the
back
teeth
that
seemed
to
me
curious
after
the
glimpse
i
had
had
of
him
with
a
little
lady
of
lille
the
boy
explained
himself
somewhat
under
cover
of
the
conversation
which
was
holding
the
interest
of
the
mess
living
unnaturally
he
said
all
an
abnormal
show
and
we
pretend
to
be
natural
and
normal
when
everything
that
happens
round
us
is
fantastic
and
your
idea
i
enquired
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
the
boy
talk
seriously
or
with
any
touch
of
gravity
to
explain
he
said
take
my
case
this
morning
i
went
up
the
line
to
interrogate
the
latest
batch
of
he
meant
prisoners
of
war
burst
within
ten
yards
of
my
car
the
other
side
of
courtrai
killed
my
driver
and
missed
me
by
a
couple
of
inches
i
felt
as
sick
as
a
dog
when
i
saw
saunders
crumpled
over
his
with
blood
pouring
down
his
neck
not
that
the
first
time
seen
blood
he
laughed
as
he
gave
a
glance
at
his
and
i
remembered
the
way
in
which
he
had
gained
his
at
gommecourt
one
of
three
left
alive
in
his
company
had
been
talking
three
minutes
before
about
his
next
leave
he
had
been
married
in
after
the
somme
and
seen
his
wife
since
said
her
letters
made
him
thought
she
was
drinking
because
of
the
loneliness
well
there
he
was
finished
and
a
nasty
sight
i
went
off
to
the
cage
and
examined
the
beggars
one
of
them
as
usual
had
been
a
waiter
at
the
and
said
dear
old
london
and
passed
the
time
of
day
with
bob
mellett
you
know
the
lad
he
laughed
no
end
when
he
heard
of
my
narrow
squeak
so
did
i
though
hard
to
see
the
joke
he
lent
me
his
car
on
the
way
back
and
somewhere
outside
courtrai
we
bumped
over
a
dead
body
with
a
queer
soft
squelch
it
was
a
german
a
young
and
bob
mellett
said
be
home
for
christmas
do
you
know
bob
he
used
to
cry
at
school
when
a
rat
was
caught
queer
it
now
here
i
am
sitting
at
a
white
listening
to
the
talk
and
pretending
to
be
interested
not
a
bit
really
wondering
why
that
bit
of
shell
hit
saunders
and
not
me
or
why
not
lying
in
a
muddy
road
as
a
bit
of
soft
squelch
for
staff
cars
to
bump
over
and
on
top
of
that
wondering
how
it
will
feel
to
hang
up
a
bowler
hat
again
in
a
house
at
wimbledon
and
say
mother
to
the
mater
who
will
be
knitting
in
the
same
armchair
by
the
piano
and
read
the
evening
paper
until
ready
take
ethel
to
a
local
dance
and
get
back
into
the
old
rut
of
home
life
in
a
nice
family
you
know
with
all
my
memories
with
the
ghosts
of
life
crowding
up
ugly
ghosts
some
of
dirty
ghosts
inconceivable
that
we
can
ever
go
back
to
the
funny
old
humdrum
not
sure
that
i
want
hipped
i
told
him
be
glad
to
get
back
all
right
wimbledon
will
be
paradise
after
what
been
lord
done
nothing
said
the
boy
is
been
talking
tripe
forget
but
i
did
not
forget
and
remembered
every
word
later
when
i
heard
his
laughter
on
armistice
night
a
stood
outside
the
door
in
his
muddy
overalls
and
brand
went
to
get
his
message
it
was
from
pierre
nesle
am
mad
with
joy
that
you
have
found
marthe
alas
i
can
not
get
back
for
a
week
tell
her
that
i
am
still
her
devoted
comrade
and
loving
brand
handed
me
the
slip
and
said
devil
i
went
back
to
my
billet
in
madame
house
and
she
made
no
allusion
to
our
conversation
in
the
afternoon
but
was
anxious
i
thought
to
assure
me
of
her
friendship
by
special
little
courtesies
as
when
she
lighted
my
candle
and
carried
it
upstairs
before
saying
hélène
was
learning
english
fast
and
furiously
and
with
her
arm
round
her
waist
said
well
sir
and
very
good
dreams
to
you
which
i
imagine
was
a
sentence
out
of
her
xv
they
were
great
days
in
the
last
two
weeks
before
the
armistice
for
me
and
for
many
men
they
were
days
of
exultation
wild
adventure
pity
immense
hope
tremendous
scenes
uplifted
by
a
sense
of
victory
though
for
others
the
soldiers
who
did
the
dirty
work
brought
up
lorry
columns
through
the
mud
of
the
old
battlefields
far
behind
our
new
front
line
carried
on
still
with
the
hard
old
drudgery
of
war
they
were
days
not
marked
out
by
any
special
jubilation
or
variety
or
hope
but
just
like
all
the
others
that
had
gone
before
since
first
they
came
to
france
i
remember
little
scenes
and
pictures
of
those
last
two
weeks
as
they
pass
through
my
mind
like
a
him
drama
episodes
of
tragedy
or
triumph
which
startled
my
imagination
a
pageantry
of
men
who
had
victory
in
their
eyes
single
figures
who
spoke
to
me
told
me
unforgettable
things
and
the
last
dead
bodies
who
fell
at
the
very
gate
of
peace
one
of
the
last
dead
bodies
i
saw
in
the
war
was
in
the
city
of
valenciennes
which
we
entered
on
the
morning
of
november
our
guns
had
spared
the
city
which
was
full
of
people
but
the
railway
station
was
an
elaborate
ruin
of
twisted
iron
and
broken
glass
rails
were
torn
up
and
sleepers
burnt
our
airmen
flying
low
day
after
day
during
the
german
retreat
had
flung
down
bombs
which
had
torn
the
fronts
off
the
and
made
of
the
and
sheds
for
german
soldiers
detraining
here
it
had
been
a
hellish
place
and
the
fire
of
our
had
been
deadly
accurate
i
walked
through
the
ruin
out
into
the
station
square
it
was
empty
of
all
life
but
one
human
figure
was
there
all
alone
it
was
the
dead
body
of
a
young
german
soldier
lying
with
outstretched
arms
on
his
back
in
a
pool
of
blood
his
figure
formed
a
cross
there
on
the
cobblestones
and
seemed
to
me
a
symbol
of
all
that
youth
which
had
been
sacrificed
by
powers
of
monstrous
evil
his
face
was
still
handsome
in
death
the
square
face
of
a
young
peasant
there
was
the
of
a
german
somewhere
on
the
right
of
the
square
as
i
walked
forward
all
my
senses
were
alert
to
the
menace
of
death
it
would
be
foolish
i
thought
to
be
killed
at
the
end
of
the
war
for
surely
the
end
was
very
near
and
then
i
had
a
sudden
sharp
thought
that
perhaps
it
would
be
well
if
this
happened
why
should
i
live
when
so
many
had
died
the
awful
job
was
done
and
my
small
part
in
it
i
had
seen
it
through
from
start
to
finish
for
it
was
finished
but
for
a
few
days
of
waiting
it
might
be
better
to
end
with
it
for
all
that
came
afterwards
would
be
anticlimax
i
remember
raising
my
head
and
looking
squarely
round
at
that
staccato
hammering
of
the
german
with
an
intense
desire
that
a
bullet
might
come
my
way
but
i
went
on
untouched
into
the
town
as
in
courtrai
a
fury
of
overhead
kept
the
people
in
their
houses
our
field
batteries
were
firing
over
the
city
and
the
enemy
was
answering
here
and
there
i
saw
a
face
peering
out
of
a
broken
window
and
then
a
door
opened
and
a
man
and
woman
appeared
behind
it
with
two
thin
children
the
woman
thrust
out
a
skinny
hand
and
grasped
mine
and
began
to
weep
she
talked
passionately
with
a
strange
mingling
of
rage
and
grief
my
god
she
said
devils
have
gone
at
last
what
have
they
not
made
us
suffer
my
husband
and
i
had
four
little
houses
we
were
innkeepers
and
last
night
they
sent
us
to
this
part
of
the
town
and
burnt
all
of
she
used
a
queer
word
in
french
night
she
said
made
a
and
set
many
houses
on
her
husband
spoke
to
me
over
his
shoulder
they
have
stolen
everything
broken
everything
ground
us
down
for
four
years
they
are
bandits
and
are
hungry
said
the
thin
girl
by
her
side
the
boy
with
a
white
pinched
face
echoed
her
plaint
have
eaten
our
bread
and
i
am
they
had
some
coffee
left
and
asked
me
to
go
inside
and
drink
it
with
them
but
i
could
not
wait
the
woman
held
my
wrist
tight
in
her
skinny
hands
will
come
back
she
asked
will
try
i
said
then
she
wept
again
and
said
are
grateful
to
the
english
soldiers
it
is
they
who
saved
that
is
one
out
of
a
hundred
little
scenes
that
i
remember
in
those
last
two
weeks
when
not
without
hard
fighting
for
the
german
rearguards
fought
bravely
to
the
end
our
troops
entered
many
towns
and
villages
and
liberated
many
thousands
of
poor
people
i
remember
the
girls
of
a
little
town
called
bohain
who
put
on
their
best
frocks
and
clean
pinafores
to
welcome
us
it
was
not
until
a
little
while
that
we
found
they
were
starving
and
had
not
even
a
crust
of
bread
in
all
the
town
then
the
enemy
started
shelling
and
some
of
the
girls
were
killed
and
many
were
suffocated
by
gas
shells
that
was
worse
in
amand
by
valenciennes
where
all
the
women
and
children
took
refuge
in
the
cellars
the
german
batteries
opened
fire
with
yellow
cross
shell
as
our
guns
passed
through
some
of
our
men
and
many
of
their
horses
lay
dead
in
the
streets
as
i
passed
through
but
worse
things
happened
in
the
cellars
below
the
houses
the
heavy
gas
of
the
yellow
cross
shells
filtered
down
to
where
the
women
and
their
babies
cowered
on
their
mattresses
they
began
to
choke
and
gasp
and
babies
died
in
the
arms
of
dying
mothers
small
our
american
went
with
a
body
of
english
doctors
and
nurses
to
the
rescue
of
amand
seen
bad
things
he
told
me
am
not
weak
in
the
stomach
but
i
saw
things
in
those
cellars
which
nearly
made
me
he
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
blinked
at
me
through
his
glasses
no
good
cursing
the
germans
as
soon
as
your
troops
entered
the
village
they
had
a
right
to
shell
war
we
should
do
the
same
war
been
cursing
the
germans
in
elaborate
and
eccentric
language
it
did
me
good
i
feel
all
the
better
for
it
but
all
the
same
i
was
wrong
war
we
ought
to
curse
war
which
makes
these
things
possible
among
civilised
peoples
just
devilry
civilised
people
must
give
up
the
habit
they
must
get
cured
of
it
you
have
heard
of
they
are
people
infected
with
the
typhoid
microbe
who
spread
the
disease
when
peace
comes
we
must
hunt
down
the
isolate
them
and
if
necessary
kill
he
waved
his
hand
to
me
and
went
off
in
an
ambulance
filled
with
suffocated
women
i
met
brand
in
valenciennes
five
days
after
our
liberation
of
the
city
when
our
troops
were
making
their
formal
entry
with
band
and
banners
he
came
up
to
me
and
said
you
heard
the
news
i
saw
by
his
face
that
it
was
good
news
and
i
felt
my
heart
give
a
lurch
when
i
answered
him
me
the
is
sending
plenipotentiaries
under
a
white
flag
to
foch
they
know
it
is
unconditional
surrender
and
the
kaiser
has
i
drew
a
deep
breath
something
seemed
to
lift
from
my
soul
the
sky
seemed
to
become
brighter
as
though
a
shadow
had
passed
from
the
face
of
the
sun
the
end
the
last
battle
has
been
fought
brand
was
staring
at
a
column
of
troops
all
young
fellows
of
the
division
his
eyes
were
glistening
with
moisture
in
them
he
said
last
of
our
youth
is
saved
he
turned
to
me
suddenly
and
spoke
in
the
deepest
melancholy
and
i
ought
to
be
dead
so
many
kids
were
killed
no
right
to
be
there
is
other
work
to
do
i
answered
him
weakly
because
i
had
the
same
thought
he
did
not
seem
sure
of
that
wonder
if
we
could
help
to
save
the
next
in
the
place
of
valenciennes
there
was
a
great
crowd
and
many
of
our
generals
and
staff
officers
on
the
steps
and
below
the
steps
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
brand
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
colonel
lavington
looking
very
gallant
and
debonair
as
usual
beside
him
was
charles
fortune
with
his
air
of
a
staff
officer
dreadfully
overworked
in
the
arrangement
of
victory
modest
in
spite
of
his
great
achievements
deprecating
any
public
homage
that
might
be
paid
him
this
careful
mask
of
his
was
slightly
disarranged
for
a
moment
when
he
winked
at
me
under
the
very
nose
of
the
great
general
whom
he
had
set
to
music
bill
the
butcher
of
the
boche
who
stood
magnificent
with
his
great
chest
emblazoned
with
ribbons
the
prince
of
wales
was
there
shifting
from
one
leg
to
another
chatting
gaily
with
a
group
of
staff
officers
a
bevy
of
french
girls
advanced
with
enormous
bouquets
and
presented
them
to
the
prince
and
his
fellow
officers
the
prince
laughed
and
blushed
like
a
schoolboy
sniffed
at
the
flowers
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
the
other
officers
held
the
bouquets
with
equal
embarrassment
with
that
strange
english
shyness
which
not
even
war
could
cure
some
officers
close
to
me
were
talking
of
the
german
plea
for
armistice
abject
surrender
said
one
of
them
end
said
another
very
solemnly
god
end
of
a
dirty
business
said
a
young
officer
i
noticed
that
he
had
three
one
of
them
holding
a
big
bouquet
began
to
dance
pointing
his
toes
cutting
abbreviated
capers
in
a
small
space
among
his
comrades
too
quick
for
me
old
dears
back
to
peace
again
back
to
life
hooray
the
colours
of
many
flags
fluttered
upon
the
gables
of
the
place
and
the
balconies
were
draped
with
the
tricolour
the
union
jack
and
the
stars
and
stripes
old
citizens
wore
tall
hats
saved
up
for
this
day
and
girls
had
taken
their
lace
from
where
the
germans
had
not
found
it
and
wore
it
round
their
necks
and
wrists
for
the
honour
of
this
day
old
women
in
black
bonnets
sat
in
the
centre
of
and
clapped
their
hands
their
wrinkled
old
hands
to
every
british
soldier
who
passed
and
thousands
were
passing
nobody
heard
a
word
of
the
speeches
spoken
from
the
town
hall
steps
the
tribute
of
the
councillors
of
valenciennes
to
the
glory
of
the
troops
who
had
rescued
their
people
from
servitude
under
a
ruthless
enemy
nor
the
answer
of
sir
henry
home
the
army
commander
expressing
the
pride
of
his
soldiers
in
the
rescue
of
that
fair
old
city
and
their
admiration
for
the
courage
of
its
people
every
word
was
overwhelmed
by
cheering
then
the
pipers
of
a
highland
division
whose
fighting
i
had
recorded
through
their
years
of
heroic
endurance
played
a
march
tune
and
the
music
of
those
pipes
was
loud
in
the
square
of
valenciennes
and
in
the
hearts
of
its
people
the
troops
marched
past
and
thousands
of
bayonets
shone
above
their
steel
helmets
xvi
i
was
in
mons
on
the
day
of
armistice
and
on
the
roads
outside
when
i
heard
the
news
that
the
germans
had
surrendered
to
all
our
terms
and
that
the
would
sound
at
eleven
it
was
a
misty
morning
with
sunlight
glinting
through
the
mist
and
sparkling
in
the
coppery
leaves
of
autumn
trees
there
was
no
heavy
bombardment
in
progress
round
mons
only
now
and
then
the
sullen
bark
of
a
gun
the
roads
were
crowded
with
the
usual
transport
of
war
endless
columns
of
and
and
crawling
slowly
forward
and
infantry
battalions
trudging
alongside
with
their
heavy
packs
i
stared
into
the
faces
of
the
marching
men
expecting
to
see
joy
in
their
eyes
wondering
why
they
were
not
singing
because
the
guns
would
be
silent
and
the
fighting
finished
their
packs
weighed
heavy
the
mud
from
passing
lorries
splashed
them
with
great
gobs
of
filth
under
their
steel
hats
the
sweat
ran
down
they
looked
and
marched
in
a
grim
fine
of
tired
men
but
i
noticed
that
the
transport
wagons
were
decorated
with
small
flags
and
these
bits
of
fluttering
colour
were
stuck
into
the
harness
of
gun
horses
and
mules
from
the
other
way
came
another
tide
of
traffic
crowds
of
civilians
who
were
men
and
boys
and
here
and
there
women
pushing
and
straining
forward
with
an
eager
homing
look
the
men
and
boys
were
carrying
bundles
too
heavy
for
many
of
them
so
that
they
were
bent
under
their
burdens
but
each
one
had
added
the
last
straw
but
one
to
his
weight
by
fastening
a
flag
to
his
bundle
or
his
cap
i
spoke
to
some
of
them
and
they
told
me
that
they
were
the
civilians
from
lille
valenciennes
and
other
towns
who
had
been
taken
away
by
the
germans
for
forced
labour
behind
the
lines
two
days
ago
the
germans
had
said
no
more
use
for
you
get
back
to
your
own
people
the
war
is
they
looked
worn
and
haggard
like
men
who
had
been
shipwrecked
some
of
the
boys
were
weak
and
sat
down
on
the
roadside
with
their
bundles
and
could
go
no
farther
others
trudged
on
gamely
with
crooks
which
they
had
cut
from
the
hedges
and
only
stopped
to
cry
les
anglais
as
our
soldiers
passed
i
looked
into
many
of
their
faces
remembering
the
photograph
of
edouard
chéri
which
had
been
given
to
me
by
his
mother
perhaps
he
was
somewhere
in
those
troops
of
homing
exiles
but
he
might
have
been
any
one
of
those
lanky
boys
in
ragged
jackets
and
broken
boots
and
cloth
caps
pulled
down
over
the
ears
just
outside
mons
at
one
minute
to
eleven
there
was
a
little
desultory
firing
then
a
bugle
blew
somewhere
in
a
distant
field
one
long
note
it
was
the
a
cheer
coming
faintly
over
the
fields
followed
the
then
there
was
no
other
sound
where
i
stood
but
the
scrunching
of
wheels
of
gun
limbers
and
transport
wagons
the
squelch
of
mud
in
which
horses
and
mules
trudged
and
the
hard
breathing
of
tired
men
marching
by
under
their
packs
so
with
a
curious
lack
of
drama
the
great
adventure
ended
that
bugle
had
blown
the
of
a
strife
which
had
filled
the
world
with
agony
and
massacre
destroyed
millions
of
men
broken
millions
of
lives
ruined
many
great
cities
and
thousands
of
hamlets
and
left
a
long
wide
belt
of
country
across
europe
where
no
tree
remained
alive
and
all
the
earth
was
ravaged
crowded
the
world
with
maimed
men
blind
men
mad
men
diseased
men
flung
empires
into
anarchy
where
hunger
killed
the
children
and
women
had
no
milk
to
feed
their
babies
and
bequeathed
to
all
fighting
nations
a
heritage
of
debt
beneath
which
many
would
stagger
and
fall
it
was
the
of
all
that
reign
of
death
but
sounded
very
faintly
across
the
fields
of
france
in
mons
canadian
soldiers
were
being
kissed
by
french
girls
women
were
giving
them
wine
in
the
doorways
and
these
fellows
tough
as
leather
reckless
of
all
risk
plastered
with
mud
which
had
worn
into
their
skins
and
souls
drank
the
wine
and
kissed
the
women
and
lurched
laughing
down
the
streets
there
would
be
no
strict
discipline
in
mons
that
night
they
had
had
enough
of
discipline
in
the
dirty
days
let
it
go
on
the
night
of
armistice
already
at
some
of
these
soldiers
were
unable
to
walk
except
with
an
arm
round
a
neck
or
round
the
neck
of
strong
peasant
girls
who
screeched
with
laughter
when
they
or
staggered
they
had
been
through
hell
those
men
they
had
lain
in
ditches
under
frightful
fire
among
dead
men
and
bleeding
men
who
would
grudge
them
their
bit
of
fun
on
armistice
night
who
would
expect
saintship
of
men
who
had
been
taught
in
the
school
of
war
taught
to
kill
quick
lest
they
be
killed
to
see
the
worst
horrors
of
the
battlefield
without
going
weak
to
educate
themselves
out
of
the
refinements
of
peaceful
life
where
christian
virtues
are
easy
and
not
meant
for
war
here
lassie
none
of
your
french
tricks
for
me
a
kiss
or
a
clout
from
the
man
grabbed
the
girl
by
the
arm
and
drew
her
into
a
barn
on
the
night
of
armistice
in
mons
where
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
the
old
contemptibles
had
first
withstood
the
shock
of
german
arms
i
saw
their
ghosts
there
in
the
market
place
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
the
devil
of
war
who
plays
on
the
passions
of
men
and
sets
his
trap
for
souls
but
i
went
away
from
mons
before
nightfall
and
travelled
back
to
lille
in
the
little
old
car
which
had
gone
to
many
strange
places
with
me
how
quiet
it
was
in
the
open
countryside
when
darkness
fell
the
guns
were
quiet
at
last
after
four
years
and
more
of
labour
there
were
no
fires
in
the
sky
no
ruddy
glow
of
death
i
listened
to
the
silence
which
followed
the
going
down
of
the
sun
and
heard
the
rustling
of
the
russet
leaves
and
the
little
sounds
of
night
in
peace
and
it
seemed
as
though
god
gave
a
benediction
to
the
wounded
soul
of
the
world
sounds
rose
from
the
towns
and
fields
in
the
deepening
of
the
day
of
armistice
they
were
sounds
of
human
joy
men
were
singing
somewhere
on
the
roads
and
their
voices
rang
out
gladly
bugles
were
playing
in
villages
from
which
the
enemy
had
gone
out
that
morning
round
about
mons
crowds
of
figures
surged
in
the
narrow
streets
and
english
laughter
rose
above
the
chatter
of
women
and
children
xvii
when
i
came
into
lille
rockets
were
rising
above
the
city
english
soldiers
were
firing
off
verey
lights
above
the
houses
of
the
city
in
darkness
rose
also
gusts
of
cheering
it
is
strange
that
when
i
heard
them
i
felt
like
weeping
they
sounded
rather
ghostly
like
the
voices
of
all
the
dead
who
had
fallen
before
this
night
of
armistice
i
went
to
my
billet
at
madame
house
from
which
i
had
been
absent
some
days
i
had
the
key
of
the
front
door
now
and
let
myself
into
the
hall
the
diningroom
door
was
open
and
i
heard
the
voices
of
the
little
french
family
laughing
crying
hysterical
surely
hysterical
mon
dieu
o
mon
petit
toto
comme
tu
es
grandi
comme
tu
es
maigre
i
stood
outside
the
door
understanding
the
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
centre
of
the
room
stood
a
tall
gaunt
boy
in
ragged
clothes
in
the
embrace
of
madame
chéri
and
with
one
hand
clutched
by
hélène
and
the
other
by
the
little
madeleine
her
sister
it
was
edouard
who
had
come
back
he
had
unloosed
a
pack
from
his
shoulder
and
it
lay
on
the
carpet
beside
him
with
a
little
flag
on
a
broken
stick
he
was
haggard
with
high
prominent
through
his
white
skin
and
his
eyes
were
sunk
in
deep
sockets
his
hair
was
in
a
wild
mop
of
black
disordered
locks
he
stood
there
with
tears
streaming
from
his
eyes
and
the
only
words
he
said
were
o
maman
maman
i
went
quietly
upstairs
and
changed
my
clothes
which
were
all
muddy
presently
there
was
a
tap
at
my
door
and
hélène
stood
there
transfigured
with
joy
she
spoke
in
french
has
come
back
my
brother
he
travelled
on
an
english
god
for
that
i
said
gladness
for
you
all
has
grown
tall
said
hélène
she
mopped
her
eyes
and
laughed
and
cried
at
the
same
time
as
a
giant
but
oh
so
thin
they
starved
him
all
the
time
he
fed
only
on
cabbages
they
put
him
to
work
digging
trenches
behind
the
line
under
fire
the
brutes
the
devils
her
eyes
were
lit
up
by
passion
at
the
thought
of
this
cruelty
and
her
suffering
then
her
expression
changed
to
a
look
of
pride
says
he
is
glad
to
have
been
under
fire
like
father
he
hated
it
though
at
the
time
and
said
he
was
frightened
i
believe
that
edouard
was
always
no
courage
that
takes
away
the
fear
of
shellfire
as
far
as
concerned
i
told
her
but
she
only
laughed
and
said
men
make
a
pose
of
being
she
spoke
of
edouard
again
hugging
the
of
his
return
only
he
were
not
so
thin
and
so
tired
i
find
him
changed
the
poor
boy
cries
at
the
sight
of
like
a
wonder
i
said
should
feel
like
that
if
i
had
been
a
prisoner
of
war
and
was
now
home
madame
voice
called
from
downstairs
edouard
veut
te
voir
wants
me
said
hélène
she
seemed
rejoiced
at
the
thought
that
edouard
had
missed
her
even
for
this
minute
she
took
my
hand
and
kissed
it
as
though
wishing
me
to
share
her
joy
and
to
be
part
of
it
and
then
ran
downstairs
xviii
i
went
out
to
the
club
which
had
been
established
in
lille
and
found
brand
there
and
fortune
and
young
clatworthy
who
made
a
place
for
me
at
their
table
two
large
rooms
which
had
been
the
dining
and
drawingrooms
of
a
private
mansion
were
crowded
with
officers
mostly
english
but
with
here
and
there
a
few
americans
and
french
seated
at
small
tables
waited
on
by
the
girls
we
called
waacs
of
the
army
auxiliary
corps
two
candelabra
of
gave
light
to
each
room
and
i
remember
that
the
walls
were
panelled
with
wood
painted
a
below
a
moulding
of
fruit
and
flowers
above
the
table
where
my
friends
sat
was
the
portrait
of
a
french
lady
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
an
oval
frame
of
tarnished
gilt
i
was
late
for
the
meal
on
armistice
night
and
many
bottles
of
champagne
had
already
been
opened
and
drunk
the
atmosphere
reeked
with
the
smell
of
food
the
fumes
of
wine
and
cigarette
smoke
and
there
was
the
noise
of
many
men
talking
and
laughing
i
looked
about
the
tables
and
saw
familiar
faces
there
were
a
good
many
cavalry
officers
in
the
room
where
i
sat
and
among
them
officers
of
the
guards
and
the
tank
corps
aviators
staff
officers
of
infantry
divisions
french
interpreters
american
officers
town
majors
and
others
the
lid
was
off
at
last
all
these
men
were
intoxicated
with
the
thought
of
the
victory
we
had
won
complete
annihilating
and
of
this
armistice
which
had
ended
the
war
and
made
them
sure
of
life
some
of
them
were
a
little
drunk
with
wine
but
not
enough
at
this
hour
to
spoil
their
sense
of
joy
officers
rose
at
various
tables
to
make
speeches
cheered
by
their
own
groups
who
laughed
and
shouted
and
did
not
listen
good
old
british
army
has
done
the
trick
at
last
old
hun
is
down
and
it
has
been
a
damned
tough
job
another
group
had
burst
into
song
to
good
old
beer
put
it
down
put
it
down
cavalry
came
into
its
own
in
the
last
lap
fought
mounted
and
fought
dismounted
rounded
up
innumerable
huns
ridden
down
another
group
was
singing
independently
a
long
long
trail
to
the
land
of
my
a
toast
was
being
pledged
at
the
next
table
by
a
tank
officer
who
stood
on
a
chair
with
a
glass
of
high
above
his
head
i
give
you
the
toast
of
the
tank
corps
this
war
was
won
by
the
tanks
him
down
shouted
two
lads
at
the
same
table
be
damned
it
was
the
poor
old
bloody
infantry
all
the
one
of
them
pulled
down
the
little
tank
officer
with
a
crash
and
stood
on
his
own
chair
to
the
the
infantry
battalions
tommy
atkins
and
his
company
officer
who
did
all
the
dirty
work
and
got
none
of
the
reward
and
did
most
of
the
a
cavalry
officer
with
a
monocle
immovably
screwed
in
his
right
eye
demanded
the
attention
of
the
company
and
failed
to
get
it
all
know
what
we
have
done
ourselves
and
what
we
failed
to
do
i
give
you
the
toast
of
our
noble
allies
without
whom
there
would
be
no
armistice
i
drink
to
the
glory
of
france
the
words
were
heard
at
several
tables
and
for
once
there
was
a
general
acknowledgment
of
the
toast
la
france
the
shout
thundered
out
from
all
the
tables
so
that
the
candelabra
rattled
five
french
interpreters
in
various
parts
of
the
room
rose
to
respond
there
were
shouts
of
stars
and
stripes
good
old
yanks
well
done
the
and
i
was
sorry
small
was
still
at
valenciennes
i
should
like
him
to
have
heard
those
shouts
an
american
staff
officer
was
on
his
feet
raising
his
glass
to
charles
fortune
stood
up
at
my
table
he
reminded
me
exceedingly
at
that
moment
of
old
prints
portraying
george
iv
in
his
youth
first
gentleman
of
slightly
flushed
with
an
air
of
noble
dignity
and
a
roguish
eye
to
it
fortune
said
brand
listening
so
you
can
say
what
you
said
fortune
venture
to
propose
the
health
of
our
late
enemy
the
young
clatworthy
gave
an
hysterical
guffaw
owe
them
a
very
great
debt
said
fortune
for
their
simplicity
of
nature
and
amiability
of
character
the
british
empire
that
glorious
conglomeration
of
races
upon
which
the
sun
utterly
declines
to
set
would
have
fallen
into
decay
and
debility
as
a
power
before
the
war
the
german
empire
was
gaining
our
trade
capturing
all
the
markets
of
the
world
waiting
at
table
in
all
the
best
hotels
and
providing
all
the
music
in
the
of
the
universe
with
that
immense
unselfishness
so
characteristic
of
their
race
the
germans
threw
away
these
advantages
and
sacrificed
themselves
for
the
benefit
of
the
british
by
declaring
war
they
enabled
all
the
ancient
virtues
of
our
race
to
be
revived
generals
sprang
up
in
every
direction
especially
in
whitehall
boulogne
and
rouen
staff
officers
multiplied
exceedingly
british
indigestion
the
curse
of
our
race
became
subject
to
a
sam
brown
belt
business
men
mostly
bankrupt
were
enriched
enormously
clergymen
thundered
joyfully
from
their
pulpits
and
went
back
to
the
old
testament
for
that
fine
old
law

an

elderly

and
wiliest
of

our
people
were
revivified
gentlemen
easy
growled
brand
is
not
a
night
for
i
said
charles
fortune
with
a
sob
of
pride
in
his
voice
i
a
simple
a
man
of
music
a
child
of
peace
and
melody
shut
up
brand
became
every
inch
a
soldier
he
drew
himself
up
in
a
heroic
pose
and
raising
his
glass
cried
out
to
our
late
enemy
poor
old
fritz
a
number
of
glasses
were
raised
amidst
a
roar
of
laughter
to
fritz
and
may
the
kaiser
roast
at
christmas
they
say
we
a
sense
of
humour
said
charles
fortune
modestly
and
opened
a
new
bottle
of
champagne
brand
had
a
sense
of
humour
and
had
laughed
dining
oration
knowing
that
beneath
its
mockery
there
was
no
malice
but
i
noticed
that
he
had
no
spontaneous
gaiety
on
this
night
of
armistice
and
sat
rather
silent
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
and
that
melancholy
of
his
young
clatworthy
was
between
me
and
brand
drinking
too
heavily
i
thought
brand
thought
so
too
and
gave
him
a
word
of
caution
champagne
is
pretty
bad
headaches
if
i
were
you
good
enough
said
clatworthy
to
put
me
in
the
right
there
was
an
unnatural
glitter
in
his
eyes
and
he
laughed
too
easily
at
any
joke
of
presently
he
turned
his
attention
to
me
and
began
talking
excitedly
in
a
low
monologue
to
think
the
last
night
can
you
believe
it
it
seems
a
lifetime
since
i
came
out
in
i
remember
the
first
night
when
i
was
sent
up
to
ypres
to
take
the
place
of
a
subaltern
been
knocked
out
it
was
christmas
eve
and
my
battalion
was
up
in
the
line
round
hooge
i
detrained
at
vlamertinghe
any
one
tell
me
the
way
to
hooge
i
asked
one
of
the
traffic
men
just
like
a
country
cousin
at
piccadilly
circus
he
looked
at
me
in
a
queer
way
and
said
the
same
way
to
hell
sir
straight
on
until
you
get
to
ypres
then
out
of
the
menin
gate
and
along
the
road
to
corner
after
that
you
trust
to
luck
some
young
gentlemen
never
get
no
i
damned
his
impertinence
and
went
on
till
i
came
to
the
grande
place
in
ypres
where
i
just
missed
an
shell
it
knocked
out
a
shocking
mess
it
made
same
way
to
hell
i
kept
saying
until
i
fell
into
a
along
the
menin
road
but
know
the
fellow
was
wrong
after
i
asked
young
clatworthy
drank
up
his
wine
and
laughed
as
though
very
much
amused
the
way
to
hell
it
was
the
other
i
was
puzzled
at
his
meaning
and
wondered
if
he
were
really
drunk
other
way
the
lines
in
the
back
areas
i
should
have
been
all
right
if
i
had
stuck
in
the
trenches
it
was
in
places
like
amiens
that
i
went
to
the
as
bad
as
that
i
said
you
he
continued
lighting
a
cigarette
and
smiling
at
the
flame
had
pleasant
times
in
this
war
between
the
bad
ones
and
afterwards
in
this
cushy
job
extraordinarily
amusing
and
agreeable
along
the
way
to
hell
there
was
little
maiguérite
in
amiens
such
a
kid
funny
as
a
kitten
she
loved
me
not
wisely
but
too
well
i
had
just
come
down
from
the
somme
battles
then
that
little
idyll
with
marguérite
was
like
a
dream
we
two
were
babes
in
the
wood
we
plucked
the
flowers
of
life
and
listen
to
the
howling
of
the
wolves
beyond
the
he
jerked
his
head
up
and
listened
and
repeated
the
words
howling
of
the
wolves
somebody
was
singing
ken
john
peel
with
his
coat
so
gay
ken
john
peel
at
the
break
of
day
ken
john
peel
when
far
far
away
with
his
horn
and
his
hounds
in
the
morning
cyril
clatworthy
was
on
his
feet
joining
in
the
chorus
with
a
loud
joyous
voice
follow
john
peel
through
fair
and
through
foul
if
we
want
a
good
hunt
in
the
morning
bravo
he
laughed
as
he
sat
down
used
to
sing
that
when
i
was
captain
of
the
school
he
said
long
time
ago
eh
how
many
centuries
i
was
as
clean
a
fellow
as
meet
in
those
days
keen
as
mustard
on
cricket
some
bat
too
that
was
before
the
dirty
war
and
the
stinking
trenches
and
fever
and
lice
and
dead
bodies
and
all
that
but
i
was
telling
you
about
yvonne
i
i
reminded
him
yvonne
i
met
her
at
cassel
a
thing
demure
you
know
the
type
one
of
the
worst
little
sluts
i
ever
met
oh
a
wicked
little
witch
well
i
paid
for
that
affair
that
policeman
was
policeman
i
asked
traffic
man
at
vlamertinghe
the
same
way
to
hell
he
said
meaning
hooge
it
was
the
other
way
really
all
the
same
had
some
good
hours
and
now
armistice
night
those
fellows
are
getting
rather
blue
they
the
blinking
cavalry
who
used
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
infantry
blocking
up
the
roads
with
their
ridiculous
horses
and
their
preposterous
lances
look
here
old
man
one
thing
i
want
to
know
tell
me
as
a
wise
is
that
i
asked
laughing
at
his
deference
to
my
wisdom
are
we
going
to
get
clean
enough
for
peace
enough
i
could
not
follow
the
drift
of
his
question
and
he
tried
to
explain
himself
i
mean
the
soap
and
water
business
but
morally
spiritually
intellectually
and
all
that
some
of
us
will
want
a
lot
of
scrubbing
before
we
sit
down
in
our
nice
little
christian
families
somewhere
at
wimbledon
or
ealing
somehow
i
funk
peace
it
means
getting
back
again
to
where
one
started
and
i
see
how
possible
good
lord
what
tripe
been
talking
he
pulled
the
bow
of
one
of
the
and
undid
her
apron
une
bouteille
de
champagne
mademoiselle
he
said
in
his
best
french
and
started
singing
some
of
the
officers
were
dancing
the
fox
trot
and
the
bunny
hug
brand
rose
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
night
he
said
god
a
crowd
of
fellows
left
to
do
the
dancing
i
help
thinking
of
the
he
touched
a
glass
with
his
lips
to
a
silent
toast
and
i
saw
that
he
drank
to
ghosts
then
he
put
the
glass
down
and
laid
his
hand
on
shoulder
for
a
stroll
he
said
room
is
too
i
old
lad
said
the
boy
is
armistice
night
and
the
end
of
the
adventure
see
it
through
brand
shook
his
head
and
said
he
must
breathe
fresh
air
fortune
was
playing
a
brahms
concerto
in
the
style
of
a
german
master
on
the
i
followed
brand
and
we
strolled
through
the
dark
streets
of
lille
and
did
not
talk
in
each
of
our
minds
was
the
stupendous
thought
that
it
was
the
last
night
of
the
war
the
end
of
the
adventure
as
young
clatworthy
had
said
god
it
had
been
a
frightful
adventure
from
first
to
last
a
fiery
furnace
in
which
youth
had
been
burnt
up
like
grass
how
much
heroism
we
had
seen
how
much
human
agony
ruin
hate
cruelty
love
there
had
been
comradeship
and
laughter
in
queer
places
and
perilous
hours
comradeship
perhaps
that
was
the
best
of
all
the
unselfish
comradeship
of
men
but
what
a
waste
of
life
what
a
lowering
of
civilisation
our
heritage
what
was
it
after
victory
who
would
heal
the
wounds
of
the
world
brand
suddenly
spoke
after
our
long
tramp
in
the
darkness
past
windows
from
which
came
music
and
singing
and
shouts
of
laughter
he
uttered
only
one
word
but
all
his
soul
was
in
it
that
night
we
went
to
see
eileen
and
to
enquire
after
the
girl
marthe
next
day
pierre
nesle
was
coming
to
find
his
sister
xix
eileen
had
gone
back
from
the
convent
to
the
rooms
she
had
before
her
trial
and
imprisonment
i
was
glad
to
see
her
in
a
setting
less
austere
than
the
whitewashed
parlour
in
which
she
had
first
received
us
there
was
something
of
her
character
in
the
where
she
had
lived
so
long
during
the
war
and
where
with
her
girl
friends
she
had
done
more
dangerous
work
than
studying
the
elements
of
drawing
and
painting
in
that
setting
too
she
looked
at
home
portrait
of
a
lady
by
lavery
as
i
saw
her
in
my
eye
when
she
sat
in
a
low
armchair
by
the
side
of
a
charcoal
stove
with
the
lamplight
on
her
face
and
hair
and
her
dress
shadowy
she
wore
a
black
dress
of
some
kind
with
a
tiny
edge
of
lace
about
the
neck
and
a
string
of
coloured
beads
so
long
that
she
twisted
it
about
her
fingers
in
her
lap
the
room
was
small
but
cosy
in
the
light
of
a
tall
lamp
on
an
iron
stand
shaded
with
red
silk
like
all
the
rooms
i
had
seen
in
lille
not
many
this
was
panelled
with
a
polished
floor
bare
except
for
one
rug
on
the
walls
were
a
few
etchings
framed
in
black
london
views
mostly
and
some
drawings
of
heads
charmingly
done
i
thought
they
were
her
own
studies
of
some
of
her
pupils
and
friends
and
one
face
especially
attracted
me
because
of
its
delicate
and
spiritual
beauty
was
my
fellow
prisoner
said
eileen
de
she
died
before
the
trial
happily
because
she
had
no
i
noticed
one
other
thing
in
the
room
which
was
pleasant
to
see
an
upright
piano
and
upon
a
stool
by
its
side
a
pile
of
old
songs
which
i
turned
over
one
by
one
as
we
sat
talking
they
were
english
and
irish
mostly
from
the
seventeenth
century
onwards
but
among
them
i
found
some
german
songs
and
on
each
cover
was
written
the
name
of
franz
von
kreuzenach
at
the
sight
of
that
name
i
had
a
foolish
sense
of
embarrassment
and
dismay
as
though
i
had
discovered
a
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
and
i
slipped
them
hurriedly
between
other
sheets
eileen
was
talking
to
wickham
brand
she
did
not
notice
my
confusion
she
was
telling
him
that
marthe
sister
was
seriously
ill
with
something
like
the
girl
had
regained
consciousness
at
times
but
was
delirious
and
kept
crying
out
for
her
mother
and
pierre
to
save
her
from
some
horror
that
frightened
her
the
nuns
had
made
enquiries
about
her
through
civilians
in
lille
some
of
them
had
heard
of
the
girl
under
her
stage
name
de
she
had
sung
in
the
before
the
war
after
the
german
occupation
she
had
disappeared
for
a
time
somebody
said
she
had
been
and
was
in
a
desperate
state
what
could
a
do
in
an
town
she
reappeared
in
a
restaurant
frequented
by
german
officers
and
kept
up
by
a
woman
of
bad
character
she
sang
and
danced
there
for
a
miserable
wage
and
part
of
her
duty
was
to
induce
german
officers
to
drink
champagne
the
worst
brand
for
the
highest
price
a
horrible
degradation
for
a
decent
girl
but
starvation
so
eileen
said
has
fierce
claws
imagine
what
agony
what
terror
what
despair
must
have
gone
before
that
surrender
to
sing
and
dance
before
the
enemies
of
your
country
said
brand
girl
should
prefer
eileen
was
twisting
the
coloured
beads
between
her
fingers
she
looked
up
at
wickham
brand
with
a
deep
thoughtfulness
in
her
dark
eyes
men
would
say
that
and
all
women
beyond
the
war
zone
safe
and
shielded
but
death
does
not
come
quickly
from
in
a
garret
without
fire
in
clothes
that
are
worn
threadbare
it
is
not
the
quick
death
of
the
battlefield
it
is
just
a
misery
then
there
is
loneliness
the
loneliness
of
a
soul
do
you
understand
that
brand
nodded
gravely
understand
the
loneliness
of
a
soul
lived
with
for
a
woman
said
eileen
was
lonely
in
lille
her
family
with
that
boy
pierre
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
lines
she
had
no
friends
here
before
the
germans
mean
that
afterwards
brand
checked
the
end
of
his
sentence
and
the
line
of
his
mouth
hardened
of
the
germans
were
kind
said
eileen
let
us
tell
the
truth
about
that
they
were
not
all
were
our
enemies
said
brand
eileen
was
silent
for
another
moment
staring
down
at
those
queer
beads
of
hers
in
her
lap
and
before
she
spoke
again
i
think
her
mind
was
going
back
over
many
episodes
and
scenes
during
the
german
occupation
of
lille
was
a
long
time
four
years
a
tremendous
time
for
hatred
to
hold
out
against
civility
kindness
and
human
nature
human
nature
is
strong
stronger
than
frontiers
nations
even
eileen
flung
her
beads
back
rose
from
the
low
chair
and
turned
back
her
hair
with
both
hands
with
a
kind
of
impatience
seen
the
truth
of
things
pretty
close
almost
as
close
as
said
brand
in
a
low
voice
were
pretty
close
to
all
the
girl
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
plunge
deep
into
the
truth
of
the
things
she
had
seen
germans
here
in
lille
were
of
all
kinds
everything
there
was
in
the
war
for
them
their
emotion
their
pride
in
the
first
victories
their
doubts
fears
boredom
anguish
brutality
sentiment
found
a
in
this
city
behind
the
some
of
them
in
the
administration
stayed
here
all
the
time
billeted
in
french
families
others
came
back
from
the
battlefields
trying
to
get
a
little
brief
happiness
forgetfulness
there
were
lots
of
them
who
pitied
the
french
people
and
had
an
immense
sympathy
with
them
they
tried
to
be
friends
tried
hard
by
every
sort
of
small
kindness
in
their
schwarz
in
madame
house
said
brand
bitterly
it
seemed
to
me
curious
that
he
was
adopting
a
mental
attitude
of
unrelenting
hatred
to
the
germans
when
as
i
knew
and
as
i
have
told
he
had
been
of
late
on
the
side
of
toleration
that
was
how
his
moods
swung
when
as
yet
he
had
no
fixed
point
of
view
yes
there
were
many
beasts
said
eileen
quickly
others
were
different
beasts
or
not
they
were
human
they
had
eyes
to
see
and
to
smile
lips
to
talk
and
tempt
it
was
their
human
nature
which
broke
some
of
our
hatred
there
were
young
men
among
them
and
in
lille
girls
who
could
be
angry
for
a
time
disdainful
longer
and
then
friendly
i
mean
lonely
girls
weak
miserable
girls
and
others
not
starved
enough
to
lose
their
passion
and
need
of
love
german
boys
and
french
girls
entangled
in
the
net
of
fate
god
pity
them
brand
said
pity
them
he
walked
over
to
the
piano
and
made
an
abrupt
request
as
though
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation
something
something
english
eileen
sang
something
irish
first
and
i
liked
her
deep
voice
so
low
and
sweet
one
that
is
pure
as
an
angel
and
fair
as
the
flowers
of
may
they
call
her
the
gentle
maiden
wherever
she
takes
her
way
her
eyes
have
the
glance
of
sunlight
as
it
brightens
the
blue
and
more
than
the
treasure
the
love
of
her
heart
i
crave
parted
afar
from
my
darling
i
dream
of
her
everywhere
the
sound
of
her
voice
is
about
me
the
spell
of
her
presence
there
and
whether
my
prayer
be
granted
or
whether
she
pass
me
by
the
face
of
that
gentle
maiden
will
follow
me
till
i
brand
was
standing
by
the
piano
with
the
light
of
the
tall
lamp
on
his
face
and
i
saw
that
there
was
a
wetness
in
his
eyes
before
the
song
was
ended
is
queer
to
hear
that
in
lille
he
said
so
long
since
i
heard
a
woman
sing
and
like
water
to
a
parched
eileen
played
the
last
bars
again
and
as
she
played
talked
softly
me
the
face
of
that
gentle
maiden
is
a
face
alice
de
who
died
in
whether
my
prayer
be
granted
or
whether
she
pass
me
by
the
face
of
that
gentle
maiden
will
follow
me
till
i
brand
turned
over
the
songs
and
suddenly
i
saw
his
face
flush
and
i
knew
the
reason
he
had
come
to
the
german
songs
on
which
was
written
the
name
of
franz
von
kreuzenach
he
turned
them
over
quickly
but
eileen
pulled
one
out
it
was
a
schubert
song
and
opened
its
leaves
was
the
man
who
saved
my
she
spoke
without
embarrassment
simply
said
brand
suppressed
the
you
know
i
told
her
that
we
had
heard
part
of
the
tale
from
the
reverend
mother
but
not
all
of
it
not
the
motive
nor
what
had
really
happened
you
guessed
i
answered
sturdily
she
laughed
but
in
a
serious
way
is
not
a
hard
guess
unless
i
am
older
than
i
feel
and
uglier
than
the
mirror
tells
me
he
was
in
love
with
brand
and
i
looked
absurdly
embarrassed
of
course
we
guessed
but
this
open
confession
was
startling
and
there
was
something
repulsive
in
the
idea
to
both
of
us
who
had
come
through
the
into
lille
and
had
seen
the
hatred
of
the
people
for
the
german
race
and
the
fate
of
pierre
sister
eileen
told
us
that
part
of
her
story
which
the
reverend
mother
had
left
out
it
explained
the
that
had
saved
this
life
though
as
the
reverend
mother
said
perhaps
the
grace
of
god
was
in
it
as
well
who
knows
franz
von
kreuzenach
was
one
of
the
intelligence
officers
whose
headquarters
were
in
that
courtyard
after
service
in
the
trenches
with
an
infantry
battalion
he
had
been
stationed
since
at
lille
until
almost
the
end
he
had
a
rank
but
was
baron
in
private
life
belonging
to
an
old
family
in
bonn
not
a
prussian
therefore
but
a
rhinelander
and
without
the
prussian
arrogance
of
manner
just
before
the
war
he
had
been
at
oxford
brasenose
college
and
spoke
english
perfectly
and
loved
england
with
a
strange
deep
unconcealed
sentiment
england
exclaimed
brand
at
this
part
of
tale
not
asked
eileen
irish
but
i
love
england
in
spite
of
all
her
faults
and
all
my
grievances
who
can
help
loving
england
that
has
lived
with
her
people
this
lieutenant
von
kreuzenach
was
two
months
in
lille
before
he
spoke
a
word
with
eileen
she
passed
him
often
in
the
courtyard
and
always
he
saluted
her
with
great
deference
she
fancied
she
noticed
a
kind
of
wistfulness
in
his
eyes
as
though
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
her
he
had
blue
eyes
sad
sometimes
she
noticed
and
a
face
rather
delicate
and
pale
one
day
she
dropped
a
pile
of
books
in
the
yard
all
of
a
heap
as
he
was
passing
and
he
said
me
and
helped
to
pick
them
up
one
of
the
books
was
of
hill
by
kipling
and
he
smiled
as
he
turned
over
a
page
or
two
love
that
book
he
said
in
perfect
english
so
much
of
the
spirit
of
old
england
in
it
history
too
fine
about
the
roman
wall
where
the
officers
go
eileen
asked
him
if
he
were
half
english
perhaps
he
had
an
english
mother
but
he
shook
his
head
and
said
he
was
wholly
german
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
though
he
wanted
to
continue
the
conversation
but
then
saluted
and
passed
on
it
was
a
week
or
so
later
when
they
met
again
and
it
was
eileen
who
said
and
made
a
remark
about
the
weather
he
stopped
and
answered
with
a
look
of
pleasure
and
boyish
surprise
jolly
to
hear
you
say
in
english
takes
me
straight
back
to
oxford
before
this
atrocious
war
besides
here
he
stopped
and
blushed
what
asked
eileen
a
long
time
since
i
talked
to
a
lady
among
officers
one
hears
nothing
but
the
last
battle
the
next
battle
technical
jargon
as
the
english
say
it
would
be
nice
to
talk
about
something
else
art
music
poetry
she
chaffed
him
a
little
irresistibly
but
you
germans
have
the
monopoly
of
all
that
art
music
poetry
they
are
all
absorbed
into
your
properly
germanised
as
for
ideas
what
is
not
in
german
philosophy
is
not
an
he
looked
profoundly
hurt
said
eileen
germans
are
very
narrow
very
stupid
like
some
english
perhaps
not
all
of
us
believe
that
german
is
the
only
knowledge
in
the
said
eileen
irish
so
we
argue
about
the
difference
between
german
and
english
he
spoke
as
if
quoting
from
a
irish
are
a
very
romantic
that
of
course
had
to
be
denied
by
eileen
who
knew
her
bernard
shaw
you
believe
it
she
said
a
hard
logical
relentless
people
like
all
peasant
folk
of
celtic
stock
the
english
who
are
romantic
and
sentimental
like
the
he
was
amazed
at
those
words
so
eileen
told
us
and
then
laughed
heartily
in
his
very
boyish
way
are
pleased
to
make
fun
of
me
you
are
pulling
my
leg
as
we
said
at
so
they
took
to
talking
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
courtyard
when
they
met
and
eileen
noticed
that
they
met
more
often
than
before
she
suspected
him
of
arranging
that
and
it
amused
her
by
that
time
she
had
a
staunch
friend
in
the
old
kommandant
who
believed
her
to
be
an
enemy
of
england
and
an
irish
patriot
she
was
already
playing
the
dangerous
game
under
his
very
nose
or
at
least
within
fifty
yards
of
the
over
which
his
nose
used
to
be
for
many
hours
of
the
day
in
his
office
it
was
utterly
necessary
to
keep
him
free
from
any
suspicion
his
confidence
was
her
greatest
safeguard
it
was
therefore
unwise
to
refuse
him
an
honest
stupid
old
gentleman
when
he
asked
whether
now
and
again
he
might
bring
one
of
his
officers
and
enjoy
an
music
in
her
rooms
after
dinner
he
had
heard
her
singing
and
it
had
gone
straight
to
his
heart
there
was
one
of
his
officers
lieutenant
baron
franz
von
kreuzenach
who
had
a
charming
voice
they
might
have
a
little
musical
recreation
which
would
be
most
pleasant
and
refreshing
your
baron
said
eileen
shall
not
scandalise
my
neighbours
when
the
courtyard
is
her
were
scandalised
when
they
heard
of
these
musical
evenings
two
or
three
times
a
month
until
she
convinced
them
that
it
was
a
service
to
france
and
a
life
insurance
for
herself
and
them
there
were
times
when
she
had
scruples
she
was
tricking
both
those
men
who
sat
in
her
room
for
an
hour
or
two
now
and
then
so
polite
so
stiffly
courteous
so
moved
with
sentiment
when
she
sang
old
irish
songs
and
franz
von
kreuzenach
sang
his
german
songs
she
was
a
spy
in
plain
and
terrible
language
and
they
were
utterly
duped
on
more
than
one
night
while
they
were
there
an
escaped
prisoner
was
in
the
cellar
below
with
a
german
uniform
and
cypher
message
and
all
directions
for
escape
across
the
lines
though
they
seldom
talked
about
the
war
yet
now
and
again
by
casual
remarks
they
revealed
the
intentions
of
the
german
army
and
its
or
lack
of
with
the
old
kommandant
she
did
not
feel
so
to
her
he
was
gentle
and
charming
but
to
others
a
bully
and
there
was
in
his
character
the
ruthlessness
of
the
prussian
officer
on
all
matters
of
and
he
hated
england
ferociously
with
franz
von
kreuzenach
it
was
different
he
was
a
humanitarian
and
sensitive
to
all
cruelty
in
life
he
hated
not
the
english
but
the
war
with
real
anguish
as
she
could
see
by
many
words
he
let
fall
from
time
to
time
he
was
she
said
a
poet
and
could
see
across
the
frontiers
of
hatred
to
all
suffering
humanity
and
so
revolted
against
the
endless
futile
massacre
and
the
spiritual
degradation
of
civilised
peoples
it
was
only
in
a
veiled
way
he
could
say
these
things
in
the
presence
of
his
superior
officer
but
she
understood
she
understood
another
thing
as
time
went
on
nearly
eighteen
months
all
told
she
saw
quite
clearly
as
all
women
must
see
in
such
a
case
that
this
young
german
was
in
love
with
her
did
not
speak
any
word
in
that
way
said
eileen
when
she
told
us
this
frankly
in
her
straight
manner
of
speech
in
his
eyes
in
the
touch
of
his
hand
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
i
knew
that
he
loved
me
and
i
was
very
was
a
bit
awkward
said
brand
speaking
with
a
strained
attempt
at
being
casual
i
could
see
that
he
was
very
much
moved
by
that
part
of
the
story
and
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
his
mind
made
me
uneasy
and
embarrassed
said
eileen
like
to
be
the
cause
of
any
suffering
and
he
was
certainly
suffering
because
of
me
it
was
a
tragic
thing
for
both
of
us
when
i
was
found
out
at
happened
asked
brand
the
thing
that
happened
was
simple
and
horrible
when
eileen
and
her
companions
were
denounced
by
the
sentry
at
the
citadel
the
case
was
reported
to
the
kommandant
of
the
intelligence
office
who
was
in
charge
of
all
business
in
lille
he
was
enormously
disturbed
by
the
suspicion
directed
against
eileen
it
seemed
to
him
incredible
at
first
that
he
could
have
been
duped
by
her
after
that
his
anger
was
so
violent
that
he
became
incapable
of
any
personal
action
he
ordered
franz
von
kreuzenach
to
arrest
eileen
and
search
her
rooms
she
resist
shoot
her
at
once
he
thundered
out
it
was
at
seven
in
the
evening
when
baron
franz
von
kreuzenach
appeared
at
door
with
two
soldiers
he
was
extremely
pale
and
agitated
eileen
rose
from
her
little
table
where
she
was
having
an
evening
meal
of
soup
and
bread
she
knew
the
moment
had
come
which
in
imagination
she
had
seen
a
thousand
times
in
baron
she
spoke
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
but
had
to
hold
to
the
back
of
her
chair
to
save
herself
from
falling
and
she
felt
her
face
become
white
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
room
silently
with
the
two
soldiers
behind
him
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
low
voice
in
english
is
my
painful
duty
to
arrest
you
miss
she
pretended
to
be
amazed
incredulous
but
it
was
as
she
knew
a
feeble
mimicry
me
why
that
is
ridiculous
on
what
charge
franz
von
kreuzenach
looked
at
her
in
a
pitiful
way
terrible
charge
espionage
and
conspiracy
against
german
martial
law
i
would
rather
have
died
than
do
this
eileen
told
us
that
he
spoke
that
word
as
only
a
german
could
as
that
law
which
for
a
german
officer
is
above
all
human
things
all
kindly
relationships
all
escape
she
pitied
him
then
more
she
said
than
she
was
afraid
for
herself
and
told
him
that
she
was
sorry
the
duty
had
fallen
to
him
he
made
only
one
other
remark
before
he
took
her
away
from
her
rooms
pray
god
the
evidence
will
be
there
was
a
military
car
waiting
outside
the
courtyard
and
he
opened
the
door
for
her
to
get
in
and
sat
opposite
to
her
the
two
soldiers
sat
together
next
to
the
driver
squeezed
close
they
were
both
stout
men
with
their
rifles
between
their
knees
it
was
dark
in
the
streets
of
lille
and
in
the
car
eileen
could
only
see
the
face
vaguely
and
white
he
spoke
again
as
they
were
driven
quickly
have
to
search
your
rooms
have
you
destroyed
your
papers
he
seemed
to
have
no
doubt
about
her
guilt
but
she
would
not
admit
it
have
no
papers
of
which
i
am
is
well
said
franz
von
kreuzenach
he
told
her
that
the
baronne
de
and
marcelle
barbier
had
been
arrested
also
and
that
news
was
like
a
to
the
girl
it
showed
that
their
conspiracy
had
been
revealed
and
she
was
stricken
at
the
thought
of
the
fate
awaiting
her
friends
those
young
delicate
girls
who
had
been
so
brave
in
taking
risks
towards
the
end
of
the
journey
which
was
not
far
franz
von
kreuzenach
began
speaking
in
a
low
emotional
voice
whatever
happened
he
said
he
prayed
that
she
might
think
of
him
with
friendship
not
blaming
him
for
that
arrest
which
was
in
obedience
to
orders
he
would
ever
be
grateful
to
her
for
her
kindness
and
the
songs
she
had
sung
they
had
been
happy
evenings
to
him
when
he
could
see
her
and
listen
to
her
voice
he
looked
forward
to
them
in
a
hungry
way
because
of
his
loneliness
said
other
things
added
eileen
and
she
did
not
tell
us
though
dimly
we
guessed
at
the
words
of
that
german
officer
who
loved
her
at
the
gate
of
the
prison
he
delivered
her
to
a
group
of
military
police
and
then
saluted
as
he
swung
round
on
his
heel
the
next
time
she
saw
him
was
at
her
trial
once
only
their
eyes
met
and
he
became
deadly
pale
and
bent
his
head
during
her
of
him
he
did
not
look
at
her
and
his
embarrassment
his
agony
she
could
see
that
he
was
suffering
made
an
unfavourable
impression
on
the
court
who
thought
he
was
not
sure
of
his
evidence
and
was
making
blundering
answers
when
she
challenged
him
she
held
him
up
to
ridicule
but
all
the
time
was
sorry
for
him
and
grateful
to
him
because
she
knew
how
much
evidence
against
her
he
had
concealed
behaved
strangely
about
that
evidence
said
eileen
puzzles
me
still
is
why
he
produced
so
much
and
yet
kept
back
the
rest
you
see
he
put
in
the
papers
he
had
found
in
the
secret
passage
and
they
were
enough
to
have
me
shot
yet
he
hushed
up
the
fact
about
the
passage
which
of
course
was
utterly
damning
it
looked
as
though
he
wanted
to
give
me
a
sporting
chance
but
that
was
not
his
character
because
he
was
a
simple
young
man
he
could
have
destroyed
the
papers
as
easily
as
he
kept
back
the
fact
about
the
underground
passage
but
he
produced
them
and
i
escaped
only
by
the
skin
of
my
teeth
read
me
that
riddle
wickham
brand
easy
said
brand
fellow
was
pulled
two
ways
by
duty
and
said
eileen
in
her
candid
way
if
you
like
it
was
a
conflict
probably
his
sense
of
duty
i
know
these
german
officers
was
strong
enough
to
make
him
hand
up
the
papers
to
his
superior
officers
he
bring
himself
to
burn
them
the
fool
then
the
other
emotion
in
him
it
a
name
said
eileen
smiling
in
her
whimsical
way
damned
love
of
his
said
brand
at
him
intolerably
and
jabbed
at
his
conscience
so
he
hid
the
news
about
the
passage
and
thought
what
a
fine
fellow
he
was
duty
and
love
both
sacrificed
have
looked
pretty
sick
if
been
shot
and
it
to
his
credit
that
you
eileen
was
amused
with
refusal
to
credit
franz
von
kreuzenach
with
any
kindness
she
said
his
suppression
of
evidence
gave
me
my
chance
if
all
were
told
i
was
brand
admitted
that
also
said
eileen
he
behaved
like
a
brand
admitted
it
grudgingly
german
then
he
realised
his
meanness
and
made
amends
unfair
he
behaved
like
a
good
fellow
probably
took
big
risks
every
one
who
knows
what
happened
must
be
grateful
to
him
if
i
meet
him
thank
eileen
held
brand
to
that
promise
and
asked
him
for
a
favour
which
made
him
hesitate
you
go
on
to
the
rhine
will
you
take
him
a
letter
from
me
against
the
rules
said
brand
rather
stiffly
eileen
those
rules
and
said
franz
von
kreuzenach
had
broken
his
for
her
sake
take
it
said
brand
that
night
when
we
left
eileen
rooms
the
armistice
was
still
being
celebrated
by
british
soldiers
verey
lights
were
rising
above
the
houses
fired
off
by
young
officers
as
symbols
of
their
own
soaring
spirits
shadows
lurched
against
us
in
the
dark
streets
as
officers
and
men
went
singing
to
their
billets
some
girls
of
lille
had
linked
arms
with
british
tommies
and
were
dancing
in
the
darkness
with
screams
of
mirth
in
one
of
the
doorways
a
soldier
with
his
steel
hat
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
rifle
lying
at
his
feet
kept
shouting
one
word
in
a
drunken
way
peace
brand
had
his
arm
through
mine
and
when
we
came
to
his
headquarters
he
would
not
let
me
go
night
he
said
sleep
just
yet
hug
the
thought
over
a
glass
of
whisky
the
war
is
over
no
more
blood
no
more
of
its
tragedy
yet
we
had
got
no
farther
than
the
hall
before
we
knew
that
tragedy
had
not
ended
with
the
armistice
colonel
lavington
met
us
and
spoke
to
brand
bad
thing
has
happened
young
clatworthy
has
shot
himself
upstairs
in
his
brand
started
back
as
if
he
had
been
hit
he
had
been
fond
of
clatworthy
as
he
was
of
all
boys
and
they
had
been
together
for
many
months
it
was
to
brand
that
clatworthy
wrote
his
last
strange
note
and
the
colonel
gave
it
to
him
then
in
the
hall
i
saw
it
afterwards
written
in
a
big
scrawl
a
few
lines
which
now
i
copy
out
old
brand
the
end
of
the
adventure
somehow
i
funk
peace
i
see
how
i
can
go
back
to
wimbledon
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
me
none
of
us
are
the
same
as
when
we
left
and
quite
different
going
over
to
the
pals
on
the
other
side
they
will
understand
cheerio
was
playing
my
flute
when
i
heard
the
shot
said
the
colonel
brand
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
made
only
one
comment
victim
of
the
poor
kid
presently
he
went
up
to
young
room
and
stayed
there
a
long
time
a
few
days
later
we
began
to
move
on
towards
the
rhine
by
slow
stages
giving
the
german
army
time
to
get
back
in
was
the
letter
to
franz
von
kreuzenach
from
eileen
end
of
book
i
book
ii
through
hostile
gates
i
the
advance
of
the
allied
armies
towards
the
rhine
was
by
definite
slow
stages
enabling
the
german
army
to
withdraw
in
advance
of
us
with
as
much
material
of
war
as
was
left
to
them
by
the
conditions
of
the
armistice
on
that
retreat
of
theirs
they
abandoned
so
much
that
it
was
clearly
impossible
for
them
to
resist
our
demands
by
fighting
again
however
hard
might
be
the
peace
terms
their
acceptance
of
the
armistice
drawn
up
by
marshal
foch
with
a
relentless
severity
in
every
clause
so
that
the
whole
document
was
a
sentence
of
death
to
the
german
military
system
proved
that
they
had
no
more
in
them
it
was
the
most
abject
and
humiliating
surrender
ever
made
by
a
great
nation
in
the
hour
of
defeat
and
an
acknowledgment
before
the
whole
world
that
their
armies
had
broken
to
bits
in
organisation
and
in
spirit
on
the
roads
for
hundreds
of
kilometres
out
from
mons
and
le
cateau
past
brussels
and
liège
and
namur
was
the
visible
proof
of
the
disintegration
and
downfall
of
what
had
been
the
greatest
military
machine
in
the
world
mile
after
mile
and
score
after
score
of
miles
on
each
side
of
the
long
straight
roads
down
which
four
years
before
the
first
german
armies
had
marched
in
endless
columns
after
the
first
brief
check
at
liège
with
absolute
faith
in
victory
there
lay
now
abandoned
guns
trench
mortars
aeroplanes
motor
lorries
motor
cars
and
transport
wagons
those
monstrous
guns
which
had
pounded
so
much
of
our
young
flesh
to
pulp
year
after
year
were
now
tossed
into
the
ditches
or
overturned
in
the
wayside
fields
with
broken
or
without
their
sights
it
was
good
to
see
them
there
upturned
thrust
their
muzzles
into
the
mud
and
belgian
boys
made
of
them
i
liked
to
see
them
at
that
game
here
also
was
the
spectacle
of
a
war
machine
which
had
worn
out
until
like
the
shay
it
had
fallen
to
pieces
those
motor
lorries
motor
cars
and
transport
wagons
were
in
the
last
stage
of
decrepitude
their
axles
and
spokes
all
rusty
their
woodwork
cracked
their
wheels
tied
round
with
bits
of
iron
in
the
place
of
tyres
everywhere
were
dead
horses
worn
to
skin
and
bones
before
they
had
fallen
for
lack
of
food
and
fats
and
rubber
and
labour
the
german
material
of
war
was
in
a
sorry
state
before
the
failure
of
their
in
the
fighting
fields
after
those
years
of
massacre
brought
home
to
them
the
awful
fact
that
they
had
no
more
strength
to
resist
our
onslaughts
one
of
those
who
pointed
the
moral
of
all
this
was
the
little
american
doctor
edward
small
and
he
found
an
immense
satisfaction
in
the
sight
of
those
derelict
wrecks
of
the
german
he
and
i
travelled
together
for
some
time
meeting
brand
harding
and
other
friends
in
towns
like
liège
and
namur
i
remember
him
now
standing
by
a
german
howitzer
a
colossus
sprawling
out
of
a
ditch
he
chuckled
in
a
goblin
way
with
his
little
grey
beard
thrust
up
by
a
muffler
which
he
had
tied
over
his
and
under
his
chin
it
was
cold
with
a
white
mist
which
clung
damply
to
our
faces
he
went
so
far
in
his
pleasure
as
to
pick
up
a
big
stone
like
those
belgian
boys
and
heave
it
at
the
monster
he
said
devil
will
never
again
vomit
out
death
upon
men
crouching
low
in
ditches
fifteen
miles
away
never
again
will
it
smash
through
the
roofs
of
farmhouses
where
people
desired
to
live
in
peace
or
bash
big
holes
in
little
old
churches
where
folk
worshipped
through
the
centuries
a
loving
god
sonny
this
damned
thing
is
symbolical
its
overthrow
means
the
downfall
of
all
the
machinery
of
slaughter
which
has
been
accumulated
by
civilised
peoples
afraid
of
each
other
in
a
little
while
if
any
sense
in
humanity
after
this
fearful
lesson
we
shall
put
all
our
guns
on
to
the
and
start
a
new
era
of
reasonable
intercourse
between
the
peoples
of
the

answered
a
mighty
big
in
that
long
sentence
of
he
blinked
at
me
with
beads
of
mist
on
his
lashes
you
go
my
faith
in
a
for
the
human
race
during
the
next
few
months
going
to
life
we
are
going
to
give
fear
the
blow
it
was
fear
that
was
the
cause
of
all
this
horrible
insanity
and
all
this
need
of
sacrifice
germany
was
afraid
of
being
by
england
france
and
russia
fear
more
than
the
lust
of
power
was
at
the
back
of
her
big
armies
france
was
afraid
of
germany
trampling
over
her
frontiers
again
russian
czardom
was
afraid
of
revolution
within
her
own
borders
and
looked
to
war
as
a
england
was
afraid
of
the
german
navy
and
afraid
of
germans
at
calais
and
dunkirk
all
the
little
powers
were
afraid
of
the
big
powers
and
made
their
beastly
little
alliances
as
a
life
insurance
against
the
time
when
they
would
be
dragged
into
the
now
with
the
german
bogey
killed
the
most
formidable
and
frightful
bogey
austria
disintegrated
russia
groping
her
way
with
bloodshot
eyes
to
a
new
democracy
a
complete
set
of
fears
has
been
removed
the
spirits
of
the
peoples
will
be
uplifted
the
darkness
of
fear
having
passed
from
them
we
are
coming
out
into
the
broad
sunlight
of
sanity
and
mankind
will
march
to
better
conquests
than
those
of
conscript
armies
thank
god
the
united
states
of
america
and
you
forget
it
will
play
a
part
in
this
advance
to
another
new
it
was
absurd
to
argue
with
the
little
man
in
a
sodden
field
on
the
road
to
liège
besides
though
i
saw
weak
links
in
his
chain
of
reasoning
i
did
not
want
to
argue
i
wanted
to
believe
also
that
our
victory
would
not
be
a
mere
vulgar
triumph
of
the
old
kind
one
military
power
rising
upon
the
ruins
of
its
rival
one
great
yell
or
many
of
we
told
you
so
but
that
it
would
be
a
victory
for
all
humanity
shamed
by
the
degradation
of
its
orgy
of
blood
in
spite
of
all
pride
in
manhood
and
that
the
peoples
of
the
world
with
one
common
enormous
generous
instinct
would
cry
out
horror
has
passed
never
again
shall
it
come
upon
us
let
us
pay
back
to
the
dead
by
contriving
a
better
way
of
life
for
those
who
follow
the
chance
of
that
lay
with
living
youth
if
they
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
betrayed
by
their
old
men
that
also
was
a
mighty
but
i
clung
to
the
hope
with
as
passionate
a
faith
as
that
of
the
little
american
doctor
the
way
to
the
rhine
lay
through
many
cities
liberated
from
hostile
rule
through
many
wonderful
scenes
in
which
emotion
surged
like
a
white
flame
above
great
crowds
there
was
a
pageantry
of
life
which
i
had
never
before
seen
in
war
or
in
peace
and
those
of
us
who
went
that
way
became
dazed
by
the
endless
riot
of
colour
and
our
ears
were
tired
by
a
tumult
of
joyous
sound
in
brussels
bruges
ghent
liège
namur
venders
banners
waved
above
every
house
flags
flags
flags
of
many
nations
and
designs
decorated
the
were
draped
on
the
balconies
were
entwined
in
the
windows
came
like
flames
above
the
heads
of
marching
crowds
everywhere
there
was
the
sound
of
singing
by
multitudes
and
through
those
weeks
one
song
was
always
in
the
air
triumphant
exultant
intoxicating
almost
maddening
in
its
effect
upon
crowds
and
individuals
the
old
song
of
liberty
and
revolt
with
it
not
so
universal
but
haunting
in
constant
refrain
between
the
outbursts
of
that
other
tune
they
sang
of
belgium
and
quaint
old
that
came
to
life
again
with
the
spirit
of
the
people
bells
pealed
from
churches
in
which
the
germans
had
left
them
by
special
favour
the
belfry
of
bruges
had
not
lost
its
carillon
in
ghent
when
the
king
of
the
belgians
rode
in
along
ways
under
banners
that
made
one
great
canopy
while
cheers
swept
up
and
around
him
to
his
grave
tanned
melancholy
face
unchanged
by
victory
so
i
had
seen
him
in
his
ruined
towns
among
his
dead
i
heard
the
great
boom
of
the
cathedral
bell
in
brussels
when
he
rode
in
later
there
were
many
bells
ringing
and
clashing
and
wild
cheering
which
to
me
lying
in
an
upper
room
after
a
smash
on
the
field
of
waterloo
seemed
uncanny
and
inhuman
like
the
murmur
of
innumerable
into
these
towns
and
along
the
roads
through
belgium
to
the
meuse
bands
were
playing
and
soldiers
singing
and
on
each
rifle
was
a
flag
or
a
flower
in
every
city
there
was
carnival
it
was
the
carnival
of
human
joy
after
long
fasting
from
the
pleasure
of
life
soldiers
and
civilians
men
and
women
sang
together
linked
arms
danced
together
through
many
streets
in
many
towns
in
the
darkness
of
those
nights
of
armistice
one
saw
the
eyes
of
people
sparkling
laughing
burning
the
eyes
of
girls
lit
up
by
inner
fires
eager
roving
alluring
untamed
and
the
eyes
of
soldiers
surprised
amused
adventurous
drunken
ready
for
any
kind
of
fun
and
sometimes
in
those
crowds
dead
eyes
or
tortured
eyes
staring
inwards
and
not
outwards
because
of
some
remembrance
which
came
like
a
ghost
between
them
and
carnival
in
ghent
there
were
other
sounds
besides
music
and
laughter
and
illuminations
too
fierce
and
ruddy
in
their
glow
to
give
me
pleasure
at
night
i
heard
the
screams
of
women
i
had
no
need
to
ask
the
meaning
of
them
i
had
heard
such
screams
before
when
pierre
sister
marthe
was
in
the
hands
of
the
mob
but
one
man
told
me
as
though
i
did
not
know
are
cutting
off
some
hair
six
of
them
the
hussies
they
were
too
friendly
with
the
germans
you
understand
now
they
are
being
stripped
for
shame
there
are
others
monsieur
many
many
if
one
only
knew
hark
at
their
howling
he
laughed
heartily
without
any
touch
of
pity
i
tried
to
push
my
way
nearer
to
try
by
some
word
of
protest
to
stop
that
merry
sport
with
hunted
women
the
crowds
were
too
dense
the
women
too
far
away
in
any
case
no
word
of
mine
would
have
had
effect
i
went
into
a
restaurant
and
ordered
dinner
though
not
hungry
brand
was
there
sitting
alone
till
i
joined
him
the
place
was
filled
with
french
and
belgian
officers
and
womenfolk
the
opened
and
another
woman
came
in
and
sat
a
few
tables
away
from
ours
she
was
a
tall
girl
rather
handsome
and
better
dressed
than
the
ordinary
of
ghent
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
me
when
she
hung
up
some
heavy
furs
on
the
peg
above
her
chair
a
waiter
advanced
towards
her
and
then
standing
began
to
shout
with
a
thrill
of
fury
in
his
voice
he
shouted
frightful
words
in
french
and
one
sentence
which
i
remember
now
week
ago
you
sat
here
with
a
german
officer
the
belgian
officers
were
listening
gravely
one
of
them
from
his
chair
with
a
flushed
wolfish
face
i
was
staring
at
the
girl
she
was
white
to
the
lips
and
held
on
to
a
brass
rail
as
though
about
to
faint
then
controlling
herself
instantly
she
fumbled
at
the
peg
pulled
down
her
furs
and
fled
through
the
she
was
another
marthe
somebody
laughed
in
the
restaurant
but
only
one
voice
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
conversation
was
resumed
as
though
no
figure
of
tragedy
had
passed
the
waiter
who
had
denounced
the
woman
swept
some
crumbs
off
a
table
and
went
to
fetch
some
soup
brand
did
not
touch
his
food
feel
sick
he
said
he
pushed
his
plate
away
and
paid
the
bill
he
forgot
to
ask
whether
i
wanted
to
eat
he
was
in
that
way
but
i
felt
like
him
and
avoiding
the
grande
place
we
walked
by
hazard
to
a
part
of
the
city
where
some
fires
were
burning
the
sky
was
reddened
and
we
smelt
smoke
and
presently
felt
the
heat
of
flames
new
devilry
asked
brand
these
people
enjoy
peace
there
been
enough
violence
a
bonfire
i
said
of
joy
and
warmth
after
cold
years
coming
closer
i
saw
that
brand
was
right
black
figures
like
dancing
devils
were
in
the
ruddy
glare
of
a
savage
fire
up
a
side
street
of
ghent
in
other
streets
were
other
fires
close
to
where
we
stood
was
an
old
inn
called
the
hotel
de
la
the
hotel
of
the
and
its
windows
had
been
heaved
out
and
inside
the
rooms
belgian
soldiers
and
citizens
were
flinging
out
tables
and
chairs
and
planks
and
wainscoting
to
feed
the
bonfire
below
and
every
time
the
flames
licked
up
to
the
new
fuel
there
were
shouts
of
joy
from
the
crowd
does
it
mean
asked
brand
and
a
man
in
the
crowd
told
us
that
the
house
had
been
used
as
the
headquarters
of
a
german
organisation
for
or
flamagands
as
they
were
called
whose
object
was
to
divide
the
walloons
or
belgians
from
the
flemings
in
the
interests
of
germany
is
the
revenge
for
those
who
have
tried
to
sow
seeds
of
hatred
said
the
man
other
people
standing
by
spoke
disapprovingly
of
the
scene
germans
have
made
too
many
fires
in
this
war
said
an
elderly
man
in
a
black
hat
with
a
high
crown
and
broad
brim
like
a
portrait
by
franz
hals
want
to
destroy
our
own
houses
now
the
enemy
has
gone
that
is
seems
unnecessary
said
brand
as
we
made
our
way
back
we
saw
the
light
of
other
fires
and
heard
the
noise
of
smashing
glass
and
a
splintering
of
woodwork
the
mob
was
sacking
shops
which
had
traded
notoriously
with
the
germans
out
of
one
alley
a
man
came
running
like
a
hunted
animal
we
heard
his
breath
panting
as
he
passed
a
shout
of
flamagand
followed
him
and
in
another
second
a
mob
had
caught
him
we
heard
his
before
they
killed
him
like
a
rat
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
such
crowds
gathered
together
as
now
in
brussels
ghent
or
liège
french
and
english
soldiers
walked
the
same
streets
khaki
and
mingling
these
two
races
had
met
before
not
as
friends
in
some
of
these
towns
five
centuries
and
more
before
in
history
but
here
also
were
men
from
canada
australia
new
zealand
south
africa
and
the
new
world
which
had
come
to
the
old
world
on
this
adventure
paying
back
something
to
the
old
blood
and
the
old
ghosts
because
of
their
heritage
yet
strangely
aloof
on
the
whole
from
these
continental
peoples
not
understanding
them
despising
them
the
english
soldier
took
it
all
as
it
came
with
that
queer
adaptability
of
his
to
any
environment
or
any
adventure
with
his
simple
human
touch
than
the
old
ypres
salient
said
one
of
them
grinning
at
me
after
a
game
of
at
venders
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
and
neck
and
as
he
raised
his
arm
i
saw
by
his
gold
stripes
that
he
had
been
three
times
wounded
yes
that
was
better
than
the
old
hell
he
roared
with
laughter
when
one
of
his
comrades
went
into
the
ring
with
a
buxom
girl
while
the
crowd
danced
round
him
holding
hands
singing
laughing
pulling
him
this
side
and
that
the
man
who
had
just
left
the
ring
spoke
to
me
again
in
a
confidential
way
wife
like
it
if
seen
me
just
then
i
tell
she
understand
nobody
can
understand
the
things
done
the
things
thought
nor
the
things
seen
unless
been
through
with
us
and
we
understand
neither
does
i
asked
to
express
agreement
with
him
but
he
took
my
words
as
a
question
to
be
answered
gord
knows
if
so
a
clever
one
is
i
wish
i
he
drifted
away
from
me
with
a
gurgle
of
laughter
at
a
girl
who
pushed
his
cap
on
one
side
along
the
kerbstone
of
the
some
transport
wagons
were
halted
and
the
drivers
were
cooking
their
evening
meal
over
a
charcoal
stove
as
though
on
one
of
the
roads
of
war
while
a
crowd
of
belgians
roared
with
laughter
at
their
with
leaden
spoons
and
dixies
one
of
them
was
a
cockney
humorist
his
type
was
always
to
be
found
in
any
group
of
english
soldiers
and
was
performing
a
pantomime
for
the
edification
of
the
onlookers
and
his
own
pleasure
a
woman
standing
on
the
edge
of
this
scene
touched
me
on
the
sleeve
you
going
forward
to
the
rhine
lieutenant
i
told
her
and
that
i
should
soon
be
among
the
germans
she
gave
a
little
tug
to
my
sleeve
and
spoke
in
a
kind
of
coaxing
whisper
cruel
to
them
lieutenant
be
hard
and
ruthless
make
them
suffer
as
we
have
suffered
tread
on
their
necks
so
that
they
squeal
her
face
and
part
of
her
figure
were
in
the
glow
from
the
charcoal
fire
of
the
transport
men
and
i
saw
that
she
was
a
little
woman
neatly
dressed
with
a
thin
gentle
rather
face
those
words
cruel
gave
me
a
shock
especially
because
of
the
soft
wheedling
tone
of
her
voice
would
you
do
i
asked
in
a
laughing
way
you
were
in
my
place
dream
at
nights
of
what
i
would
like
to
do
there
are
so
many
things
i
would
like
to
do
for
vengeance
i
think
all
german
women
should
be
killed
to
stop
them
breeding
that
is
one
the
next
i
asked
would
be
well
to
kill
all
german
babies
perhaps
the
good
god
will
do
it
in
his
infinite
are
religious
madame
had
only
our
prayers
she
said
with
piety
a
band
of
dancing
people
bore
down
upon
us
and
swept
us
apart
from
a
high
balcony
an
italian
who
had
been
a
prisoner
of
war
sang
marseillaise
and
though
these
ears
had
been
dinned
with
it
all
day
though
their
throats
were
hoarse
with
singing
it
they
listened
to
it
now
again
as
though
it
were
a
new
revelation
the
man
sang
with
passion
in
his
voice
as
powerful
as
a
trumpet
more
thrilling
than
that
the
passion
of
four
agony
in
some
foul
inspired
him
now
as
he
sang
that
song
of
liberty
and
triumph
enfants
de
la
patrie
le
jour
de
gloire
est
arrivé
the
crowd
took
up
the
song
again
and
it
roared
across
the
square
of
venders
until
another
kind
of
music
met
and
clashed
with
it
and
overwhelmed
it
with
brazen
notes
it
was
the
town
band
of
venders
composed
of
citizens
mostly
and
portly
some
old
and
scraggy
in
long
and
tall
solemnly
with
puffed
cheeks
they
marched
along
parting
the
waves
of
people
as
they
went
as
it
seemed
by
the
power
of
their
blasts
they
were
playing
an
old
tune
called
its
refrain
comes
back
to
me
now
with
the
picture
of
that
carnival
in
venders
with
all
those
faces
all
that
human
pressure
and
emotion
and
behind
them
as
though
following
the
pied
piper
pied
pipers
came
dancing
at
least
a
thousand
people
eight
abreast
with
linked
arms
or
linked
hands
they
were
young
belgian
boys
and
girls
old
belgian
men
and
women
children
british
soldiers
american
soldiers
english
scottish
irish
canadian
australian
russian
and
italian
of
war
just
liberated
from
their
new
to
liberty
they
were
all
singing
that
old
song
of
and
all
dancing
in
a
kind
of
jig
other
crowds
dancing
and
singing
came
out
of
into
the
wide
grande
place
mingled
like
human
waves
meeting
swirled
in
wild
laughing
eddies
carnival
after
the
long
fasting
brand
clutched
me
by
the
arm
and
laughed
in
his
deep
hollow
voice
at
that
old
satyr
i
believe
daddy
small
is
pan
himself
it
was
the
little
american
doctor
he
was
in
the
centre
of
a
row
of
eight
in
the
vanguard
of
a
dancing
column
a
girl
of
the
type
pretty
impudent
with
a
strand
of
fair
hair
blowing
loose
from
her
little
fur
cap
was
clinging
to
his
arm
on
one
side
while
on
the
other
was
a
stout
woman
with
a
cheerful
flemish
face
and
eyes
linked
up
with
the
others
they
jigged
behind
the
town
band
little
grey
beard
had
a
raffish
look
his
field
cap
was
tilted
back
from
his
bony
forehead
his
spectacles
were
askew
he
had
the
happy
look
of
careless
boyhood
he
did
not
see
us
then
but
later
in
the
evening
detached
himself
from
the
stout
flemish
lady
who
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
and
made
his
way
to
where
brand
and
i
stood
under
the
portico
of
a
hotel
doctor
said
brand
would
your
old
patients
in
new
york
say
to
this
bacchanalian
orgy
said
the
doctor
believe
it
incredible
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
threaded
his
fingers
through
his
grey
beard
and
laughed
in
that
shrill
way
which
was
his
habit
when
excited
word
it
was
good
fun
i
became
part
of
a
joy
i
had
their
sense
of
escape
from
frightful
things
youth
came
back
to
me
their
songs
danced
in
my
blood
in
spite
of
my
goggles
and
my
grey
beard
that
buxom
lady
adored
me
as
though
i
were
the
young
adonis
the
little
girl
clasped
my
hand
as
though
i
were
her
younger
brother
time
rolled
back
from
the
world
old
age
was
touched
with
the
divine
elixir
in
that
crowd
there
is
the
springtime
of
life
when
pan
played
on
his
pipes
through
pagan
woods
i
have
missed
it
for
a
million
dollars
that
night
brand
and
i
and
some
others
charles
fortune
among
them
were
billeted
in
a
small
hotel
which
had
been
a
german
headquarters
a
few
days
before
there
was
a
piano
in
the
billiard
room
and
fortune
touched
its
keys
several
notes
were
broken
but
he
skipped
them
deftly
and
improvised
a
musical
caricature
of
small
dancing
in
the
carnival
he
too
had
seen
that
astonishing
vision
and
it
inspired
him
to
grotesque
fantasies
in
his
imagination
he
brought
a
great
general
to
venders
bill
the
butcher
of
the
and
gave
him
a
in
the
grande
place
like
an
elephant
gambolling
in
green
fields
and
trumpeting
his
joy
young
harding
was
moody
and
confided
to
me
that
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
crossing
the
german
frontier
and
going
to
cologne
will
be
dirty
work
he
said
sure
as
fate
the
huns
will
begin
sniping
and
then
we
shall
have
to
start
reprisals
well
if
they
ask
for
it
i
hope
we
shall
give
it
them
without
mercy
after
all
they
have
done
at
the
first
sign
of
treachery
i
hope
the
will
begin
to
play
every
time
i
see
a
hun
i
shall
feel
like
slitting
his
get
into
a
murderous
state
of
mind
i
answered
him
shall
see
plenty
and
live
among
them
i
expect
they
will
be
tame
poor
devils
of
ours
will
be
murdered
in
their
beds
said
harding
makes
my
blood
boil
to
think
of
it
i
only
hope
we
stand
any
nonsense
like
to
see
cologne
cathedral
go
up
in
flames
that
would
be
a
charles
fortune
broke
away
from
his
musical
fantasy
of
and
played
a
bar
or
two
of
the
in
ragtime
it
was
a
greeting
to
pierre
nesle
who
came
into
the
room
quietly
in
his
and
heavy
with
a
salute
to
the
company
soir
petit
pierre
said
fortune
y
a
done
quoi
avec
ta
figure
si
sombre
si
mélancolique
tristesse
pierre
nesle
inspired
him
to
sing
a
little
old
french
of
pierrot
disconsolate
pierre
had
just
motored
down
from
lille
a
long
journey
and
was
blue
with
cold
as
he
said
warming
his
hands
at
the
charcoal
stove
he
laughed
at
jesting
begged
a
cigarette
from
harding
apologised
for
keeping
on
his
for
a
while
until
he
had
thawed
out
and
i
admired
the
pluck
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
him
since
he
had
gone
to
lille
to
see
his
sister
i
knew
by
the
new
lines
about
his
eyes
and
mouth
by
a
haggard
older
look
he
had
that
he
had
seen
that
sister
of
his
marthe
and
knew
her
tragedy
it
was
to
room
that
he
went
after
midnight
and
from
brand
a
day
later
i
heard
what
had
happened
he
had
begun
by
thanking
brand
for
that
rescue
of
his
sister
in
lille
in
a
most
composed
and
courteous
way
then
suddenly
that
mask
fell
from
him
and
he
sat
down
heavily
in
a
chair
put
his
head
down
on
his
arms
upon
the
table
and
wept
like
a
child
in
uncontrollable
grief
brand
was
immensely
distressed
and
could
not
think
of
any
word
to
comfort
him
he
kept
saying
courage
as
i
had
said
to
madame
chéri
when
she
broke
down
about
her
boy
edouard
as
the
young
baronne
had
sent
word
to
eileen
from
her
prison
and
as
so
many
men
and
women
had
said
to
others
who
had
been
stricken
by
the
cruelties
of
war
boy
was
down
and
out
said
brand
could
i
say
it
is
one
of
those
miseries
for
which
there
is
no
cure
he
began
to
talk
about
his
sister
when
they
had
been
together
at
home
in
paris
before
the
war
she
had
been
so
gay
so
comradely
so
full
of
adventure
then
he
began
to
curse
god
for
having
allowed
so
much
cruelty
and
men
for
being
such
devils
he
cursed
the
germans
but
then
in
most
frightful
language
most
bitterly
of
all
he
cursed
the
people
of
lille
for
having
tortured
a
woman
who
had
been
starved
into
weakness
and
had
sinned
to
save
her
life
he
contradicted
himself
then
violently
and
said
was
no
sin
my
sister
was
a
loyal
girl
to
france
in
her
soul
she
was
loyal
so
she
swore
to
me
on
her
crucifix
i
would
have
killed
her
if
she
had
been
so
there
you
are
pierre
nesle
is
broken
on
the
wheel
of
war
like
so
many
others
the
cure
i
said
his
generation
one
undo
the
things
that
are
brand
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
bedroom
where
he
had
been
telling
me
these
things
and
now
at
my
words
he
stopped
and
stared
at
me
before
answering
i
think
right
this
generation
has
been
hard
hit
and
we
shall
go
about
with
unhealed
wounds
but
the
next
generation
try
to
save
it
from
all
this
horror
if
the
world
will
only
understand
the
next
day
we
left
venders
and
crossed
the
german
frontier
on
the
way
to
the
rhine
ii
brand
and
i
who
were
inseparable
now
and
young
harding
who
had
joined
us
crossed
the
belgian
frontier
with
our
leading
troop
of
cavalry
the
dragoon
guards
and
entered
germany
on
the
morning
of
december
for
three
days
our
advanced
cavalry
outposts
had
been
halted
on
the
frontier
line
beyond
venders
and
spa
the
scenery
had
become
german
already
with
roads
winding
through
fir
forests
above
deep
ravines
where
red
undergrowth
glowed
like
fire
through
the
rich
green
of
and
where
on
the
hillsides
and
in
the
valleys
were
wooden
and
villas
with
pointed
turrets
like
those
in
the
black
forest
we
halted
this
side
of
a
little
stone
bridge
over
the
stream
which
divides
the
two
countries
a
picket
of
dragoons
was
holding
the
bridge
with
double
sentries
under
orders
to
let
no
man
pass
until
the
signal
was
given
to
advance
the
name
of
this
place
asked
brand
of
a
young
cavalry
officer
smoking
a
cigarette
and
clapping
his
hands
to
keep
warm
sir
said
that
child
removing
the
cigarette
from
his
lips
he
pointed
to
a
small
house
on
rising
ground
beyond
a
white
building
with
a
slate
roof
and
said
the
first
house
in
germany
i
suppose
invite
us
to
brand
and
i
leaned
over
the
stone
bridge
watching
and
listening
to
the
swirl
of
tawny
water
over
big
grey
stones
red
water
said
brand
a
bad
name
when
one
thinks
of
the
rivers
of
blood
that
have
flowed
between
our
armies
and
this
place
been
a
long
journey
to
this
little
we
stared
across
the
brook
and
were
enormously
stirred
i
was
at
least
by
the
historic
meaning
of
this
scene
over
there
a
few
yards
away
was
germany
the
fringe
of
what
had
been
until
some
weeks
ago
the
mighty
german
empire
not
a
human
being
appeared
on
that
side
of
the
stone
bridge
there
was
no
german
sentry
facing
ours
the
gate
into
germany
was
open
and
unguarded
a
deep
silence
was
over
there
by
the
where
the
undergrowth
was
red
i
wondered
what
would
happen
when
we
rode
through
that
silence
and
that
loneliness
into
the
first
german
town
malmédy
and
afterwards
through
many
german
towns
and
villages
on
the
way
to
the
rhine
looking
back
on
that
adventure
i
remember
our
psychological
sensations
our
surprise
at
the
things
which
happened
and
failed
to
happen
the
change
of
mind
which
gradually
dawned
upon
some
of
our
officers
the
incredulity
resentment
suspicion
amazement
which
overcame
many
of
them
because
of
the
attitude
of
the
german
people
whom
they
met
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
without
arms
in
their
hands
i
have
already
said
that
many
of
our
officers
had
a
secret
dread
of
this
advance
into
german
territory
not
because
they
were
afraid
of
danger
to
their
own
skins
but
because
they
had
a
greater
fear
of
being
called
upon
to
do
in
the
event
of
civilians
sniping
and
any
sign
of
the
they
had
been
warned
by
the
high
command
that
that
might
happen
and
that
there
must
be
a
ruthless
punishment
of
any
such
crimes
turn
for
atrocities
whispered
young
cavalry
officers
remembering
louvain
and
alost
and
they
hated
the
idea
we
were
in
the
state
of
mind
which
led
to
some
of
the
black
business
in
belgium
when
the
germans
first
advanced
nervous
ready
to
believe
any
rumour
of
treacherous
attack
more
afraid
of
civilian
hostility
than
of
armed
troops
a
single
shot
fired
by
some
drunken
fool
in
a
german
village
a
single
man
of
ours
killed
in
a
brawl
or
murdered
by
a
german
out
for
vengeance
might
lead
to
most
bloody
tragedy
rumour
was
already
whispering
of
ghastly
things
i
remember
on
the
first
day
of
our
advance
meeting
a
young
officer
of
ours
in
charge
of
an
armoured
car
which
had
broken
down
across
the
frontier
outside
a
village
give
a
million
pounds
to
get
out
of
this
job
he
said
gloomily
the
matter
i
asked
he
told
me
that
the
game
was
already
beginning
and
swore
frightful
oaths
game
he
answered
sharply
you
get
the
news
two
of
our
fellows
have
been
killed
in
that
village
sniped
from
the
windows
presently
i
shall
be
told
to
sweep
the
streets
with
jolly
work
what
he
was
utterly
wrong
though
where
he
heard
the
lie
which
made
him
miserable
i
never
knew
i
walked
into
the
village
and
found
it
peaceful
no
men
of
ours
had
been
killed
there
no
men
of
ours
had
yet
entered
it
the
boy
who
was
to
go
forward
with
the
leading
cavalry
patrol
across
the
rothwasser
that
morning
had
to
the
same
degree
he
leaned
sideways
in
his
saddle
and
confided
his
fears
to
me
with
laughter
which
did
not
conceal
his
apprehensions
no
trouble
the
ghost
of
an
idea
what
to
do
if
the
hun
turns
nasty
i
know
a
word
of
their
beastly
language
either
if
the
boy
who
takes
the
wrong
turning
be
too
hard
on
me
it
was
a
sunday
morning
with
a
cold
white
fog
on
the
and
white
frost
on
and
red
bracken
our
cavalry
and
horse
artillery
with
their
transport
drawn
up
on
the
belgian
side
of
the
frontier
before
the
bugle
sounded
for
the
forward
march
were
standing
by
their
horses
clapping
hands
beating
chests
stamping
feet
the
men
wore
their
steel
hats
as
though
for
an
advance
in
the
usual
conditions
of
warfare
and
the
troopers
of
the
leading
patrol
rode
forward
with
drawn
swords
they
rode
at
the
trot
through
pine
forests
along
the
edge
of
deep
ravines
in
which
innumerable
were
powdered
with
glistening
frost
there
was
the
beat
of
hoofs
on
frozen
roads
but
the
countryside
was
intensely
silent
the
farmhouses
we
passed
and
cottages
under
the
shelter
of
the
woods
seemed
abandoned
no
flags
hung
out
from
them
like
those
millions
of
flags
which
had
fluttered
along
all
the
miles
of
our
way
through
belgium
now
and
again
looking
back
at
a
farmhouse
window
i
saw
a
face
there
staring
out
but
it
was
quickly
withdrawn
a
dog
came
out
and
barked
at
us
savagely
sign
of
hostility
said
the
cavalry
lieutenant
turning
round
in
his
saddle
and
laughing
boyishly
the
troopers
behind
him
grinned
under
their
steel
hats
and
then
looked
stem
again
glancing
sideways
into
the
glades
of
those
silent
would
be
easy
to
snipe
us
from
those
woods
said
harding
damned
easy
quite
senseless
said
brand
good
would
it
do
them
harding
was
prepared
to
answer
the
question
he
had
been
thinking
it
out
hun
never
did
have
any
sense
not
likely
to
get
it
now
nothing
will
ever
change
him
he
is
a
bad
treacherous
evil
swine
we
must
be
prepared
for
the
worst
and
if
it
comes
asked
brand
harding
had
a
grim
look
and
his
mouth
was
hard
must
act
without
mercy
as
they
did
in
murder
you
mean
said
brand
harshly
free
hand
for
said
harding
they
ask
for
brand
gave
his
usual
groan
lord
we
finished
with
blood
we
dipped
down
towards
malmédy
there
was
a
hairpin
turn
in
the
road
and
we
could
see
the
town
below
us
in
the
valley
a
german
town
good
shouted
the
cavalry
kid
he
was
pleased
with
himself
for
having
led
his
troop
on
the
right
road
but
i
guessed
that
he
would
be
glad
to
halt
this
side
of
the
mystery
that
lay
in
that
town
where
sunday
bells
were
ringing
a
queer
thing
happened
then
up
a
steep
bank
was
a
party
of
girls
german
girls
of
course
and
the
first
civilians
we
had
seen
a
flutter
of
white
handkerchiefs
came
from
them
they
were
waving
to
us
damned
said
harding
yet
answered
brand
ironically
but
he
was
as
much
astonished
as
all
of
us
when
we
came
into
malmédy
the
cavalry
patrol
halted
in
the
market
square
and
dismounted
it
was
about
midday
and
the
german
people
were
coming
out
of
church
numbers
of
them
surrounded
us
staring
at
the
horses
whose
sleek
look
seemed
to
amaze
them
and
at
the
men
who
lit
up
cigarettes
and
loosened
the
straps
of
their
steel
hats
some
girls
patted
the
necks
of
the
horses
and
said
a
young
man
in
the
crowd
in
black
civilian
clothes
with
a
bowler
hat
spoke
in
perfect
english
to
the
horses
are
looking
fine
ours
are
skin
and
bones
when
will
the
infantry
be
here
an
idea
said
the
gruffly
another
young
man
addressed
himself
to
me
in
french
which
he
spoke
as
though
it
were
his
native
tongue
this
the
first
time
you
have
been
in
germany
monsieur
i
told
him
i
had
visited
germany
before
the
war
will
find
us
changed
he
said
have
suffered
very
much
and
the
spirit
of
the
people
is
broken
you
see
they
have
been
hungry
so
i
looked
round
at
the
crowd
and
saw
some
girls
among
them
and
children
who
looked
it
was
only
the
younger
men
who
had
a
pinched
look
people
here
do
not
seem
hungry
i
said
he
explained
that
the
state
of
malmédy
was
not
so
bad
it
was
only
a
village
and
they
could
get
produce
from
the
farms
about
all
the
same
they
were
on
short
commons
and
were
underfed
never
any
meat
no
fats
coffee
in
the
bigger
towns
there
was
real
hunger
or
at
least
an
or
malnutrition
which
was
causing
disease
in
all
classes
and
great
mortality
among
the
children
speak
french
well
i
told
him
and
he
said
that
many
people
in
malmédy
spoke
french
and
german
in
a
way
it
was
so
close
to
the
belgian
frontier
is
why
the
people
here
had
no
heart
in
the
war
even
in
the
beginning
my
wife
was
a
belgian
girl
when
i
was
mobilised
she
said
are
going
to
kill
my
brothers
and
wept
very
much
i
think
that
killed
her
she
died
in
the
young
man
spoke
gravely
but
without
any
show
of
emotion
he
narrated
his
personal
history
in
the
war
he
had
been
in
the
first
and
second
battles
of
ypres
then
badly
wounded
and
put
down
at
the
base
as
a
clerk
for
nearly
two
years
after
that
when
german
was
running
short
he
had
been
pushed
into
the
ranks
again
and
had
fought
in
flanders
cambrai
and
valenciennes
now
he
had
demobilised
himself
am
very
glad
the
war
is
over
monsieur
it
was
a
great
stupidity
from
the
beginning
now
germany
is
he
spoke
in
a
simple
way
as
though
describing
natural
disturbances
of
life
regrettable
but
inevitable
i
asked
him
whether
the
people
farther
from
the
frontier
would
be
hostile
to
the
english
troops
and
he
seemed
surprised
at
my
question
why
sir
the
war
is
over
and
we
can
now
be
friends
again
besides
the
respectable
people
and
the
middle
he
used
the
french
word
be
glad
of
your
coming
it
is
a
protection
against
the
evil
elements
who
are
destroying
property
and
behaving
in
a
criminal
way
the
sailors
of
the
fleet
and
the
low
war
is
over
and
we
can
be
friends
again
that
sentence
in
the
young
speech
astonished
me
by
its
directness
and
simplicity
was
that
the
mental
attitude
of
the
german
people
did
they
think
that
england
would
forget
and
shake
hands
did
they
not
realise
the
passion
of
hatred
that
had
been
aroused
in
england
by
the
invasion
of
belgium
the
early
atrocities
the
submarine
war
the
sinking
of
the
the
execution
of
nurse
çavell
the
over
london
all
the
range
and
sweep
of
german
frightfulness
then
i
looked
at
our
troopers
some
of
them
were
chatting
with
the
germans
in
a
friendly
way
one
of
them
close
to
me
gave
a
cigarette
to
a
boy
in
a
college
cap
who
was
talking
to
him
in
schoolboy
english
another
was
in
conversation
with
two
german
girls
who
were
patting
his
horse
we
had
been
in
the
german
village
ten
minutes
there
was
no
sign
of
hatred
here
on
one
side
or
the
other
already
something
had
happened
which
in
england
if
they
knew
would
seem
monstrous
and
incredible
a
spell
had
been
broken
the
spell
which
for
four
years
had
dominated
the
souls
of
men
and
women
at
least
it
seemed
to
have
been
broken
in
the
village
where
for
the
first
time
english
soldiers
met
the
people
of
the
nation
they
had
fought
and
beaten
these
men
of
the
first
cavalry
patrol
did
not
seem
to
be
nourishing
thoughts
of
hatred
and
vengeance
they
were
not
it
seemed
remembering
atrocities
they
were
meeting
with
human
friendliness
and
seemed
inclined
to
talk
to
them
and
pass
the
time
of
day
astounding
i
saw
wickham
brand
talking
to
a
group
of
german
children
boys
in
sailor
caps
with
the
words
kaiser
wilhelm
der
grosse
printed
in
gold
letters
on
the
and
girls
with
yellow
pigtails
and
coloured
frocks
he
pulled
out
a
packet
of
chocolate
from
a
deep
pocket
of
his
british
warm
and
broke
it
into
small
pieces
would
like
a
bit
he
asked
in
german
and
there
was
a
chorus
of
bitte
schön
he
held
out
a
piece
to
the
prettiest
child
a
tiny
thing
with
hair
and
she
blushed
very
vividly
and
curtseyed
when
she
took
the
chocolate
and
then
kissed
long
lean
hand
young
harding
was
standing
near
he
had
an
utterly
bewildered
expression
as
a
man
who
sees
the
groundwork
of
his
faith
slipping
beneath
him
he
turned
to
me
as
i
strolled
his
way
and
looked
at
me
with
wide
astonished
eyes
understand
he
stammered
these
people
any
pride
this
show
of
friendliness
what
does
it
mean
rather
they
scowled
and
showed
their
hatred
than
stand
round
fawning
on
us
and
our
men
they
seem
to
bear
any
malice
look
at
that
fellow
gossiping
with
those
two
girls
shameful
what
have
we
been
fighting
for
if
it
ends
in
this
sort
of
thing
it
makes
it
all
a
farce
he
was
so
disturbed
so
unnerved
by
the
shock
of
his
surprise
that
there
were
tears
of
vexation
in
his
eyes
i
could
not
argue
with
him
or
explain
things
to
him
i
was
astonished
myself
quite
baffled
by
a
german
friendliness
that
was
certainly
sincere
and
not
a
mask
hiding
either
hatred
or
humiliation
those
people
of
malmédy
were
pleased
to
see
us
as
yet
i
could
not
get
the
drift
of
their
psychology
in
spite
of
what
the
young
german
had
told
me
i
gave
harding
the
benefit
of
that
talk
is
a
frontier
town
i
said
people
are
not
real
germans
in
their
sympathies
and
that
seemed
to
comfort
harding
a
little
he
clung
on
to
the
thought
that
when
we
had
got
beyond
the
frontier
we
should
meet
the
hatred
he
expected
to
see
he
wanted
to
meet
it
he
wanted
to
see
scowling
looks
deep
humiliation
a
shameful
recognition
of
defeat
the
evil
nature
of
the
people
we
had
been
fighting
otherwise
to
him
the
war
was
all
a
lie
for
four
years
he
had
been
inspired
strengthened
and
upheld
by
hatred
of
the
germans
he
believed
not
only
in
every
atrocity
story
that
appeared
in
english
newspapers
but
also
in
accordance
with
all
else
he
read
that
every
german
was
essentially
and
unutterably
vile
brutal
treacherous
and
evil
the
german
people
were
to
him
a
race
apart
the
huns
they
had
nothing
in
common
with
ordinary
human
nature
with
its
kindliness
and
weakness
they
were
physically
mentally
and
morally
debased
they
were
a
race
of
devils
and
they
could
not
be
allowed
to
live
civilisation
could
only
be
saved
by
their
extermination
or
if
that
were
impossible
by
their
utter
subjection
all
the
slaughter
of
british
youth
and
french
youth
was
to
him
justified
by
the
conviction
that
the
last
man
of
ours
must
die
if
need
be
in
order
to
crush
germany
and
kill
germans
it
is
true
that
he
had
not
died
nor
even
had
been
wounded
but
that
was
his
he
had
been
in
the
cavalry
and
had
not
been
given
many
chances
of
fighting
before
the
last
phase
when
the
cavalry
came
into
their
own
he
had
been
transferred
to
the
intelligence
though
he
did
not
speak
a
word
of
german
in
order
to
organise
their
service
he
knew
nothing
about
but
his
cousin
was
the
of
a
nephew
and
he
had
been
highly
recommended
for
this
appointment
which
had
surprised
and
annoyed
him
still
as
a
young
man
who
believed
in
obedience
to
authority
and
in
all
old
traditional
systems
such
as
patronage
and
privilege
he
had
accepted
the
post
without
protest
it
had
made
no
difference
to
his
consuming
hatred
of
the
hun
when
all
his
companions
were
pessimistic
about
final
victory
he
had
remained
an
optimist
because
of
his
faith
that
the
huns
must
be
destroyed
or
god
would
be
betrayed
when
some
of
his
colleagues
who
had
lived
in
germany
before
the
war
praised
the
german
as
a
soldier
and
exonerated
the
german
people
from
part
at
least
of
the
guilt
of
their
war
lords
he
tried
to
conceal
his
contempt
for
this
folly
due
to
the
mistaken
generosity
of
the
english
character
and
repeated
his
own
creed
of
abhorrence
for
their
race
and
character
only
good
german
is
a
dead
german
he
said
a
thousand
times
to
arguments
pleading
extenuating
circumstances
for
german
peasants
german
women
german
children
but
now
in
this
village
of
malmédy
on
our
first
morning
across
the
frontier
within
three
minutes
of
our
coming
english
troopers
were
chatting
with
germans
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
create
on
either
side
brand
was
giving
chocolate
to
german
children
and
german
girls
were
patting
the
necks
of
english
horses
he
said
after
my
attempted
explanation
too
close
to
the
frontier
these
people
are
different
wait
till
we
get
on
a
bit
convinced
we
shall
have
trouble
and
at
the
slightest
sign
of
it
we
shall
sweep
the
streets
with
fire
got
my
own
revolver
handy
and
i
mean
to
use
it
without
mercy
if
any
iii
harding
had
no
need
to
use
his
revolver
on
the
way
to
the
rhine
or
in
cologne
where
he
stayed
for
some
months
after
armistice
we
went
on
with
the
cavalry
into
many
villages
and
small
towns
by
slow
stages
the
infantry
following
behind
in
strength
with
guns
and
transport
the
girls
outside
malmédy
were
not
the
only
ones
who
waved
handkerchiefs
at
us
now
and
then
it
is
true
there
were
scowling
looks
from
men
who
had
obviously
been
german
officers
until
a
few
weeks
ago
sometimes
in
village
inns
the
german
would
be
sullen
and
silent
leaving
his
wife
or
his
maidservant
to
wait
upon
us
but
even
that
was
rare
more
often
there
was
frank
curiosity
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
who
stared
at
us
and
often
unconcealed
admiration
at
the
smart
appearance
of
our
troops
often
german
welcomed
our
officers
with
bows
and
smiles
and
prepared
meat
meals
for
us
in
the
country
districts
while
explaining
that
meat
was
scarce
and
hardly
tasted
by
ordinary
folk
their
wives
and
their
maidservants
praised
god
that
the
war
was
over
lasted
too
long
they
said
the
misery
of
it
it
was
madness
to
slaughter
each
other
like
that
brand
and
i
went
into
a
little
shop
to
buy
a
toothbrush
the
woman
behind
the
counter
talked
about
the
war
was
due
to
the
wickedness
of
great
people
she
said
are
many
people
who
grew
rich
out
of
the
war
they
wanted
it
to
go
on
and
on
so
that
they
could
get
more
rich
they
gorged
themselves
while
the
poor
starved
it
was
the
poor
who
were
robbed
of
their
she
did
not
speak
passionately
but
with
a
dull
kind
of
anger
own
was
taken
she
said
presently
after
wrapping
up
the
they
took
hans
my
eldest
he
was
killed
almost
at
once
at
liège
then
they
took
my
friedrich
he
was
killed
at
ypres
next
wilhelm
died
in
hospital
at
brussels
he
had
both
his
legs
blown
off
last
they
took
little
karl
my
youngest
he
was
killed
by
an
far
behind
the
lines
near
a
tear
splashed
on
the
bit
of
paper
in
which
she
had
wrapped
the
she
wiped
it
away
with
her
apron
man
and
i
are
now
alone
she
said
handing
us
the
packet
are
too
old
to
have
more
children
we
sit
and
talk
of
our
sons
who
are
dead
and
wonder
why
god
did
not
stop
the
is
sad
said
brand
he
could
find
nothing
else
to
say
not
with
this
woman
could
he
argue
about
german
guilt
es
ist
she
took
the
money
with
a
in
the
town
of
mürren
i
spent
some
time
with
brand
and
others
in
the
barracks
where
a
number
of
and
were
being
handed
over
by
german
officers
according
to
the
terms
of
the
armistice
the
officers
were
mostly
young
men
extremely
polite
anxious
to
save
us
any
kind
of
trouble
marvellous
in
their
concealment
of
any
kind
of
humiliation
they
may
have
felt
have
felt
in
this
delivery
of
arms
they
were
confused
only
for
one
moment
and
that
was
when
a
boy
with
a
wheelbarrow
trundled
by
with
a
load
of
german
swords
elaborate
parade
swords
with
gold
hilts
one
of
them
laughed
and
passed
it
off
with
a
few
words
in
english
goes
the
old
pomp
and
glory
the
brand
made
things
easier
by
a
tactful
sentence
world
will
be
happier
when
we
are
all
a
officer
talked
to
me
he
had
been
a
hairdresser
in
bayswater
and
a
in
flanders
he
was
a
little
fellow
with
a
queer
cockney
accent
is
we
shall
have
a
bad
time
in
front
of
us
no
money
no
trade
all
the
same
it
will
be
better
in
the
long
run
no
more
conscription
no
more
filthy
war
all
looking
to
president
wilson
and
his
there
is
the
hope
of
the
world
we
can
hope
for
a
good
peace
fair
all
round
of
course
have
to
pay
but
we
shall
get
liberty
like
in
was
the
man
sincere
were
any
of
these
people
sincere
or
were
they
crawling
fawning
hiding
their
hatred
ready
for
any
treachery
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
we
went
into
cologne
some
days
before
our
programme
at
the
urgent
request
of
the
we
were
invited
in
the
german
seamen
of
the
grand
fleet
had
played
the
devil
as
in
all
the
towns
they
had
passed
through
they
had
established
a
and
council
on
the
russian
system
raised
the
red
flag
liberated
the
criminals
from
the
prisons
shops
had
been
sacked
houses
looted
the
desired
british
troops
to
ensure
law
and
order
there
was
no
disorder
visible
when
we
entered
cologne
the
revolutionaries
had
disappeared
the
streets
were
thronged
with
folk
among
whom
were
thousands
of
men
who
had
taken
off
their
uniforms
a
few
days
before
our
coming
or
had
themselves
by
tearing
off
their
and
badges
as
our
first
squadron
rode
into
the
great
cathedral
square
on
the
way
to
the
hohenzollem
bridge
many
people
in
the
crowds
turned
their
heads
away
and
did
not
glance
at
the
british
cavalry
we
were
deliberately
ignored
and
i
thought
that
for
the
germans
it
was
the
best
attitude
with
most
dignity
others
stared
gravely
at
the
passing
cavalcade
showing
no
excitement
no
hostility
no
friendliness
no
emotion
of
any
kind
here
and
there
i
met
eyes
which
were
regarding
me
with
a
dark
brooding
look
and
others
in
which
there
was
profound
melancholy
that
night
when
i
wandered
out
alone
and
lost
my
way
and
asked
for
direction
two
young
men
obviously
officers
until
a
few
days
back
walked
part
of
the
way
to
put
me
right
and
said
schön
bitte
when
i
thanked
them
and
saluted
with
the
utmost
courtesy
i
wondered
what
would
have
happened
in
london
if
we
had
been
defeated
and
if
german
officers
had
walked
out
alone
at
night
and
lost
themselves
in
and
asked
the
way
imagination
fails
before
such
a
thought
certainly
our
civility
would
not
have
been
so
easy
we
could
not
have
hidden
our
hatred
like
that
if
these
were
hiding
hatred
somehow
i
could
not
find
even
the
smouldering
fires
of
hate
in
any
german
with
whom
i
spoke
that
day
i
could
find
only
a
kind
of
dazed
and
recognition
of
defeat
a
deep
sadness
among
humble
people
a
profound
anxiety
as
to
the
future
fate
of
a
ruined
germany
and
a
hope
in
the
justice
of
england
and
america
a
score
of
us
had
luncheon
at
the
domhof
hotel
opposite
the
cathedral
which
harding
had
hoped
to
see
in
flames
the
manager
bowed
us
in
as
if
we
had
been
distinguished
visitors
in
time
of
peace
the
handed
us
the
menu
and
regretted
that
there
was
not
much
choice
of
food
though
they
had
scoured
the
country
to
provide
for
us
he
and
six
other
waiters
spoke
good
english
learnt
in
london
and
seemed
to
have
had
no
interruption
in
their
way
of
life
in
spite
of
war
they
were
not
rusty
in
their
art
but
masters
of
its
service
according
to
tradition
yet
they
had
all
been
in
the
until
the
day
of
armistice
and
the
a
man
of
forty
with
hair
growing
grey
and
the
look
of
one
who
had
spent
years
in
a
study
rather
than
in
trenches
after
table
management
told
me
that
he
had
been
three
times
wounded
in
flanders
and
in
the
last
phase
had
been
a
in
the
rearguard
actions
round
grevilliers
and
bapaume
he
revealed
his
mind
to
me
between
the
soup
and
the
stew
strange
talk
from
a
german
waiter
used
to
ask
myself
a
hundred
thousand
times
am
i
here
in
this
mud
fighting
against
the
english
whom
i
know
and
like
what
meaning
is
there
in
all
this
what
are
the
evil
powers
that
have
forced
us
to
this
insane
massacre
i
thought
i
should
go
mad
and
i
desired
i
did
not
argue
with
him
for
the
same
reason
that
brand
and
i
did
not
argue
with
the
woman
behind
the
counter
who
had
lost
four
sons
i
did
not
say
war
lords
were
guilty
of
this
war
the
evil
passion
and
philosophy
of
you
german
people
brought
this
upon
the
world
your
i
listened
to
a
man
who
had
been
stricken
by
tragedy
who
had
passed
through
its
horrors
and
was
now
immensely
sad
at
a
small
table
next
to
us
were
the
boy
who
had
led
the
first
cavalry
patrol
and
two
they
were
not
eating
their
soup
they
were
talking
to
the
waiter
a
young
fellow
who
was
making
a
map
with
knives
and
spoons
is
the
village
of
fontaine
notre
dame
he
said
was
just
here
with
my
when
you
said
one
of
the
young
cavalry
officers
was
here
at
the
corner
of
this
spoon
lying
on
my
belly
with
my
nose
in
the
mud
scared
the
german
waiter
and
the
three
officers
laughed
together
something
had
happened
which
had
taken
away
from
them
the
desire
to
kill
each
other
our
officers
did
not
suspect
there
might
be
poison
in
their
soup
the
young
waiter
was
not
nervous
lest
one
of
the
knives
he
laid
should
be
thrust
into
his
heart
some
nights
later
i
met
wickham
brand
in
the
hohestrasse
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
laughed
in
a
strange
ironical
way
do
you
think
of
it
all
he
asked
i
told
him
that
if
old
men
from
street
clubs
in
london
and
young
women
in
the
suburbs
clamouring
for
the
head
could
be
transported
straight
to
cologne
without
previous
warning
of
the
things
they
would
see
they
would
go
raving
mad
brand
agreed
knocks
one
edgewise
even
those
of
us
who
we
stood
on
one
side
by
a
shop
window
filled
with
beautiful
and
watched
the
passing
crowd
it
was
a
crowd
of
german
well
dressed
apparently
well
fed
the
girls
wore
heavy
furs
the
men
were
in
black
coats
and
bowler
hats
or
in
military
overcoats
and
felt
hats
among
them
not
aloof
but
mingling
with
them
laughing
with
them
were
english
and
canadian
soldiers
many
of
them
were
with
german
girls
others
were
surrounded
by
groups
of
young
germans
who
had
been
unmistakably
soldiers
until
a
few
weeks
earlier
germans
were
acting
as
interpreters
in
the
exchange
of
experiences
gossip
opinions
the
german
girls
needed
no
interpreters
their
eyes
spoke
and
their
laughter
brand
and
i
went
into
an
immense
called
the
so
densely
crowded
that
we
had
to
wander
round
to
find
a
place
foggy
with
through
which
electric
light
blazed
noisy
with
the
music
of
a
loud
unceasing
orchestra
which
as
we
entered
was
playing
selections
from
here
also
were
many
english
and
canadian
officers
and
men
sitting
at
the
same
tables
with
germans
who
laughed
and
nodded
at
them
clinked
their
mugs
or
with
them
and
raised
bowler
hats
to
british
tommies
when
they
left
the
tables
with
friendly
greetings
on
both
sides
there
was
no
orgy
here
no
impropriety
some
of
the
soldiers
were
becoming
slightly
fuddled
with
rhine
wine
but
not
noisily
were
passing
between
them
and
german
girls
or
conversations
made
up
by
winks
and
signs
and
words
but
all
quietly
and
respectfully
in
outward
behaviour
brand
and
i
were
wedged
close
to
a
table
at
which
sat
one
of
our
a
corporal
a
german
woman
and
two
german
girls
one
of
the
girls
spoke
english
remarkably
well
and
the
conversation
of
our
two
men
was
directed
to
her
and
through
her
to
the
others
brand
and
i
were
eavesdroppers
your
ma
said
the
i
have
been
so
keen
to
fight
germans
if
i
had
known
they
were
such
pleasant
decent
people
as
far
as
i
find
at
present
and
i
take
people
as
i
find
the
girl
translated
to
her
mother
and
sister
and
then
answered
mother
says
the
war
was
prepared
by
the
rich
people
in
europe
who
made
the
people
mad
by
said
the
wonder
i
know
some
of
them
swine
all
the
same
of
course
you
began
it
you
there
was
another
translation
and
the
girl
answered
again
mother
says
the
germans
begin
it
the
russians
began
it
by
moving
their
armies
the
russians
hated
us
and
wanted
the
gave
a
snort
of
laughter
russians
they
soon
tired
of
it
anyhow
let
us
all
down
eh
about
atrocities
said
the
corporal
who
was
a
cockney
said
the
girl
yes
there
were
many
the
russians
were
very
oft
it
said
the
corporal
mean
german
said
the
girl
our
soldiers
were
well
behaved
always
there
were
many
lies
told
in
the
english
true
enough
said
the
why
they
fed
us
up
with
lies
germans
are
starving
the
germans
are
on
their
last
great
victory
at
neuve
god
i
was
in
that
great
victory
the
whole
battalion
cut
to
pieces
and
not
an
officer
left
a
bloody
shambles
and
no
sense
in
it
another
drop
of
wine
my
dear
to
me
said
the
cockney
corporal
there
was
a
deal
of
dirty
work
on
both
sides
not
going
to
say
there
no
german
atrocities
lies
or
no
lies
becos
saw
a
few
of
myself
no
mistake
but
what
i
says
now
is
what
i
says
when
i
lay
in
the
lousy
trenches
with
busting
down
the
parapets
the
old
devil
got
us
all
by
the
legs
i
said
and
a
for
the
poor
blighters
on
the
other
side
of
the
barbed
wire
lying
in
the
same
old
mud
now
beginning
to
think
the
germans
are
the
same
as
us
no
better
nor
no
worse
i
reckon
any
you
can
tell
your
sister
miss
that
i
like
the
way
she
does
it
reminds
me
of
my
the
german
girl
did
not
understand
this
speech
she
appealed
to
the
does
your
friend
say
the
roared
with
chum
says
that
a
pretty
face
cures
a
lot
of
your
sister
is
a
sweet
little
thing
he
says
perhaps
you
had
better
not
translate
that
part
to
your
ma
have
another
drop
of
wine
my
presently
the
party
rose
from
the
table
and
went
out
the
paying
for
the
drinks
in
a
lordly
way
and
saying
you
to
the
mother
of
the
two
girls
this
said
brand
when
they
had
gone
very
instructive
and
been
making
kind
brand
looked
away
into
the
vista
of
the
room
and
his
eyes
roved
about
the
tables
where
other
soldiers
of
ours
sat
with
other
germans
found
out
he
said
the
british
hatred
of
a
nation
breaks
down
in
the
presence
of
its
individuals
discovered
that
it
is
not
in
the
character
of
english
canadian
too
by
the
look
of
it
to
demand
vengeance
from
the
innocent
for
the
sins
of
the
guilty
seeing
that
human
nature
ours
anyhow
swings
back
to
the
normal
as
soon
as
an
abnormal
strain
is
released
it
is
normal
in
human
nature
to
be
friendly
towards
its
kind
in
spite
of
five
education
in
i
doubted
that
and
told
him
so
remembering
scenes
in
ghent
and
lille
and
that
girl
marthe
and
the
woman
of
venders
that
shook
brand
a
little
from
his
new
point
of
view
and
he
shifted
his
ground
with
the
words
wrong
told
me
of
other
of
his
after
conversation
with
many
german
people
explaining
perhaps
the
lack
of
hostility
and
humiliation
which
had
surprised
us
all
they
were
glad
to
see
the
english
because
they
were
afraid
of
the
french
and
belgians
with
their
desire
for
vengeance
they
believed
in
english
in
spite
of
all
the
wild
propaganda
of
the
war
now
that
the
kaiser
had
fled
and
germany
was
a
republic
they
believed
that
in
spite
of
defeat
and
great
ruin
there
would
be
a
peace
which
would
give
them
a
chance
of
recovery
and
a
new
era
of
liberty
according
to
the
pledges
of
president
wilson
and
the
terms
of
the
they
believed
they
had
been
beaten
by
the
hunger
blockade
and
not
by
the
failure
of
the
german
armies
in
the
field
and
they
would
not
admit
that
as
a
people
they
were
more
guilty
in
the
war
than
any
others
of
the
fighting
nations
is
a
sense
of
guilt
said
brand
must
be
brought
home
to
them
they
must
be
convinced
of
that
before
they
can
get
clean
again
and
gain
the
he
leaned
over
the
table
with
his
square
face
in
the
palms
of
his
hands
knows
he
said
there
was
evil
on
both
sides
we
have
our
junkerdom
too
the
philosophy
of
our
old
men
was
not
shining
in
its
christian
charity
we
share
the
guilt
of
the
war
still
the
germans
the
aggressors
they
must
acknowledge
german
war
lords
and
militarists
i
suggested
that
woman
who
lost
her
four
sons
nor
peasants
dragged
from
their
ploughs
ignorant
of
all
a
muddle
said
brand
sort
it
out
full
of
bewilderment
and
contradictions
sometimes
when
i
look
at
these
germans
in
the
streets
some
of
them
so
smug
i
shudder
and
say
are
the
people
who
killed
my
pals
and
filled
with
cold
rage
but
when
they
tell
me
all
they
suffered
and
their
loathing
of
the
war
i
pity
them
and
say
were
trapped
like
we
were
by
false
ideas
and
false
systems
and
the
foul
lies
of
politicians
and
the
dirtiness
of
old
diplomacy
and
the
philosophy
of
europe
leading
up
to
then
he
told
me
something
which
interested
me
more
at
the
time
than
his
groping
to
find
truth
because
a
touch
of
personal
drama
is
always
more
striking
to
the
mind
than
general
aspects
and
ideas
billeted
at
the
house
of
franz
von
kreuzenach
you
remember
i
was
astounded
at
that
an
amazing
coincidence
was
no
coincidence
he
said
arranged
it
i
had
that
letter
to
deliver
and
i
wanted
to
meet
the
fellow
as
yet
however
i
have
only
seen
his
mother
and
sister
they
are
very
so
did
wickham
brand
for
trouble
as
soldiers
say
and
certainly
he
found
it
before
long
iv
the
first
meeting
between
wickham
brand
and
young
franz
von
kreuzenach
had
been
rather
dramatic
according
to
my
account
of
it
and
he
did
not
dramatise
his
stories
much
in
spite
of
being
before
the
war
an
unsuccessful
novelist
it
had
happened
on
the
third
night
after
his
presentation
of
the
which
by
military
right
of
occupation
ordered
the
owners
of
the
house
to
provide
a
bedroom
and
for
an
officer
there
had
been
no
trouble
about
that
the
who
had
answered
the
door
of
the
big
white
house
in
a
side
street
off
the
kaiserring
had
dropped
a
curtsey
and
in
answer
to
fluent
and
polite
german
said
at
once
sie
herein
and
took
him
into
a
to
the
right
of
the
hall
leaving
him
there
while
she
went
to
fetch
gnadige
that
is
to
say
the
baroness
von
kreuzenach
brand
remained
standing
and
studied
the
german
to
read
its
character
as
a
key
to
that
of
the
family
under
whose
roof
he
was
coming
by
right
of
conquest
for
that
in
plain
words
was
the
meaning
of
his
presence
it
was
a
large
square
room
handsomely
and
heavily
furnished
in
an
style
belonging
perhaps
to
the
germany
of
bismarck
but
with
here
and
there
in
its
adornment
a
lighter
and
more
modern
touch
on
one
wall
in
a
gilt
frame
to
which
fat
gilt
cupids
clung
was
a
large
portrait
of
william
of
prussia
and
on
the
wall
opposite
in
a
similar
frame
a
portrait
of
the
william
ii
brand
saw
also
with
an
instant
thrill
of
remembrance
two
large
steel
engravings
from
portraits
of
queen
victoria
and
prince
albert
he
had
seen
them
as
a
child
in
his
house
at
kew
and
in
the
houses
of
grandfathers
who
cherished
these
representations
of
victoria
and
albert
with
almost
religious
loyalty
the
large
square
of
turkey
carpet
on
polished
boards
a
mahogany
sideboard
and
some
stiff
big
armchairs
of
clumsily
carved
oak
were
reminiscent
of
german
furniture
and
taste
in
the
period
of
the
century
when
ours
was
equally
atrocious
the
later
period
had
obtruded
itself
into
that
background
there
was
a
piano
in
white
wood
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
here
and
there
light
chairs
in
the
style
of
germany
with
thin
legs
and
straight
uncomfortable
backs
the
most
pleasing
things
in
the
room
were
some
porcelain
figures
of
saxon
and
hanover
ware
little
german
ladies
with
pleated
gowns
and
bodices
and
on
the
walls
a
number
of
drawings
mostly
of
english
scenes
delicately
done
with
vision
and
a
nice
sense
of
atmosphere
younger
generation
thrusting
out
the
old
thought
brand
the
spirit
of
both
of
them
destroyed
by
what
has
happened
in
five
the
door
opened
he
told
me
when
he
had
taken
stock
of
his
surroundings
and
there
came
in
two
women
one
the
other
young
he
guessed
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
frau
von
kreuzenach
and
her
daughter
and
made
his
bow
with
an
apology
for
intruding
upon
them
he
hoped
that
they
would
not
be
in
the
least
degree
disturbed
by
his
he
would
need
only
a
bedroom
and
his
breakfast
the
baroness
was
courteous
but
rather
cold
in
her
dignity
she
was
a
handsome
woman
of
about
with
very
fair
hair
streaked
with
grey
and
a
thin
aristocratic
type
of
face
with
thin
lips
she
wore
a
black
silk
dress
with
some
fur
round
her
shoulders
will
be
no
inconvenience
to
us
sir
she
answered
in
good
english
a
little
hard
and
the
english
people
are
pleased
to
call
us
here
she
laughed
trust
that
you
will
not
be
too
uncomfortable
in
a
german
house
in
spite
of
the
privations
due
to
our
misfortunes
and
the
severity
of
your
in
that
short
speech
there
was
a
hint
of
hostility
masked
under
a
graciousness
of
manner
which
wickham
brand
did
not
fail
to
perceive
long
as
it
is
not
inconvenient
he
said
awkwardly
it
was
the
daughter
who
now
spoke
and
brand
was
grateful
for
her
friendly
words
and
impressed
by
her
undeniable
and
exceptional
good
looks
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
older
woman
was
clear
at
a
glance
she
had
the
same
thin
face
and
fair
hair
but
youth
was
on
her
side
and
her
features
had
no
hardness
of
line
that
comes
from
age
or
bitterness
her
hair
was
like
spun
gold
as
one
sees
it
in
prussia
more
i
fancy
than
in
southern
germany
and
her
complexion
was
that
perfect
and
which
often
belongs
to
german
girls
and
is
if
they
are
soft
and
plump
as
many
are
this
fault
was
thinness
but
to
brand
not
a
sentimentalist
nor
quickly
touched
by
feminine
influence
i
have
written
that
but
on
second
thoughts
believe
that
under
ruggedness
there
was
a
deep
strain
of
sentiment
approaching
weakness
she
seemed
and
spiritual
so
he
told
me
after
his
early
acquaintance
with
her
her
first
words
to
him
were
charming
have
suffered
very
much
from
the
war
sir
but
we
welcome
you
to
our
house
not
as
an
enemy
because
the
war
finished
with
the
armistice
but
as
an
englishman
who
may
come
to
be
our
said
brand
he
could
find
nothing
else
to
say
at
the
moment
but
spoke
that
one
word
gratefully
the
mother
added
something
to
her
speech
believed
the
english
were
our
friends
before
they
declared
war
upon
us
we
were
deeply
saddened
by
our
was
inevitable
said
brand
what
had
the
daughter
her
name
was
elsa
put
her
hand
on
her
arm
with
a
quick
gesture
of
protest
against
any
other
words
about
the
war
will
show
captain
brand
to
his
brand
wondered
at
her
quickness
in
knowing
his
name
after
one
glance
at
his
and
said
do
not
trouble
when
he
saw
a
look
of
disapproval
almost
of
alarm
on
the
face
will
be
better
for
truda
to
show
the
gentleman
to
his
rooms
i
will
ring
for
elsa
von
kreuzenach
challenged
her
authority
by
a
smile
of
amusement
and
there
was
a
slight
deepening
of
that
delicate
colour
in
her
face
is
boiling
the
usual
cabbage
for
the
usual
i
will
go
she
turned
to
brand
with
a
smile
and
bowed
to
him
will
act
as
your
guide
upstairs
captain
brand
after
that
you
may
find
your
own
way
it
is
not
brand
who
described
the
scene
to
me
told
me
that
the
girl
went
very
quickly
up
a
wide
flight
of
stairs
so
that
in
his
big
riding
boots
he
found
it
difficult
to
keep
pace
with
her
she
went
down
a
long
corridor
lined
with
etchings
on
the
walls
and
opened
a
white
door
leading
into
a
big
room
furnished
as
a
library
there
was
a
wood
fire
burning
there
and
at
a
glance
brand
noticed
one
or
two
decorations
on
the
walls
a
pair
of
foils
with
a
and
gauntlets
some
charcoal
drawings
one
of
a
head
which
was
this
when
that
gold
hair
of
hers
hung
in
two
gretchen
and
some
antlers
you
can
sit
and
smoke
your
pipe
said
elsa
von
kreuzenach
if
you
are
bored
you
can
read
those
books
you
see
we
have
many
english
authors
bernard
shaw
wells
chesterton
kipling
heaps
my
brother
and
i
used
to
read
all
we
could
get
of
english
brand
remembered
that
franz
von
kreuzenach
had
read
kipling
he
had
quoted
of
to
eileen
and
then
he
said
may
read
a
little
said
the
girl
is
so
dull
most
of
it
not
exciting
like
she
opened
another
door
is
your
bedroom
it
used
to
belong
to
my
brother
he
want
it
asked
brand
he
could
have
bitten
his
tongue
out
for
that
question
when
the
girl
answered
it
was
killed
in
a
sudden
sadness
took
possession
of
her
eyes
and
brand
said
i
was
sorry
too
and
wept
for
weeks
he
was
a
nice
boy
so
jolly
as
you
say
he
would
have
been
an
artist
if
he
had
lived
all
those
charcoal
sketches
are
by
she
pointed
to
the
drawing
of
a
young
head
over
the
is
my
brother
franz
he
is
home
again
sei
dank
heinrich
worshipped
brand
looked
at
the
portrait
of
the
man
who
had
saved
eileen
he
had
letter
to
him
in
his
pocket
it
was
a
head
with
frank
eyes
rather
noble
hope
we
shall
meet
one
day
said
brand
elsa
von
kreuzenach
seemed
pleased
with
those
words
will
like
to
meet
you
ever
so
much
you
see
he
was
educated
at
oxford
and
does
not
forget
his
love
for
spite
of
the
war
asked
brand
the
girl
put
both
her
hands
to
her
breast
war
she
said
us
forget
the
years
when
we
all
went
mad
it
was
a
madness
of
hate
and
of
lies
and
of
ignorance
on
both
sides
the
poor
people
in
all
countries
suffered
for
the
sins
of
the
wicked
men
who
made
this
war
against
our
will
and
called
out
our
evil
passions
the
wicked
men
in
england
were
as
bad
as
those
in
germany
now
it
is
for
good
people
to
build
up
a
new
world
out
of
the
ruins
that
war
made
the
ruin
of
she
asked
a
direct
question
of
brand
earnestly
you
one
of
those
who
will
go
on
hating
brand
hesitated
he
could
not
forget
many
things
he
knew
so
he
told
me
that
he
had
not
yet
killed
the
old
hatred
that
had
made
him
a
sniper
in
no
land
many
times
it
surged
up
again
he
could
not
forgive
the
germans
for
many
cruelties
to
this
girl
then
he
hedged
a
little
future
must
wipe
out
the
past
the
peace
must
not
be
for
at
those
last
words
the
blue
eyes
of
elsa
von
kreuzenach
lighted
up
gladly
is
the
old
english
spirit
i
have
said
to
my
mother
and
father
a
thousand
times
is
generous
at
heart
she
loves
fair
play
now
that
victory
is
hers
she
will
put
away
base
passions
and
make
a
noble
peace
that
will
help
us
out
of
our
agony
and
ruin
all
our
hope
is
with
england
and
with
the
american
president
who
is
the
noblest
man
on
your
father
and
mother
asked
brand
do
they
say
the
girl
smiled
rather
miserably
belong
to
the
old
school
franz
and
i
are
of
the
younger
generation
my
father
denounces
england
as
the
demon
behind
all
the
and
little
mother
finds
it
hard
to
forgive
england
for
joining
the
war
against
us
and
because
the
english
army
killed
heinrich
you
must
be
patient
with
she
spoke
as
though
brand
belonged
already
to
their
family
life
and
would
need
great
tact
she
moved
towards
the
door
and
stood
framed
there
in
its
white
woodwork
a
pretty
figure
have
two
maidservants
for
this
great
house
she
said
war
has
made
us
poor
truda
and
gretchen
they
are
called
they
are
both
quarrelling
for
the
pleasure
of
waiting
on
you
they
are
both
frightfully
excited
to
have
an
english
officer
in
the
said
brand
laughing
queer
asked
elsa
von
kreuzenach
am
a
little
excited
she
made
a
like
an
early
victorian
girl
and
then
closed
his
door
and
brand
was
sorry
as
he
told
me
quite
frankly
that
he
was
left
alone
a
pretty
piece
of
dresden
china
he
said
when
i
chaffed
him
with
a
care
old
lad
he
only
growled
and
muttered
to
hell
with
that
i
suppose
i
can
admire
a
pretty
thing
even
if
made
in
germany
brand
told
me
that
he
met
father
and
brother
on
the
third
evening
that
he
slept
in
the
house
when
he
arrived
that
evening
at
about
five
the
truda
who
his
bedroom
and
dusted
his
with
a
german
passion
for
cleanliness
and
with
many
conversational
advances
informed
him
with
a
look
of
mysterious
importance
that
the
wanted
to
see
him
in
the
old
man
asked
brand
at
which
truda
giggled
and
said
old
herr
hates
the
english
like
ten
thousand
devils
added
truda
confidentially
i
had
better
not
go
then
was
answer
truda
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
go
when
the
old
herr
baron
asked
for
a
thing
it
had
to
be
given
him
the
only
person
who
dared
to
disobey
him
was
frâulein
elsa
who
was
very
brave
and
a
brand
braced
himself
for
the
interview
but
felt
extremely
nervous
when
truda
rapped
at
the
drawingroom
door
opened
it
and
announced
in
german
english
officer
the
family
von
kreuzenach
was
in
full
strength
obviously
waiting
for
his
arrival
the
baroness
was
in
an
evening
gown
of
black
silk
showing
her
bare
neck
and
arms
she
was
sitting
stiffly
in
a
chair
by
the
piano
and
was
very
handsome
in
her
cold
way
her
husband
general
von
kreuzenach
was
pretending
to
read
a
book
by
the
fireside
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
short
white
moustache
the
ribbon
of
the
iron
cross
was
fastened
to
the
top
buttonhole
of
his
elsa
was
sitting
on
a
stool
by
his
side
and
on
a
low
seat
with
his
back
to
the
fire
was
a
tall
young
man
with
his
left
arm
in
a
sling
whom
brand
knew
at
once
to
be
franz
von
kreuzenach
eileen
friend
when
brand
came
into
the
room
everybody
rose
in
a
formal
frightening
way
and
mother
rose
very
graciously
and
spoke
to
her
husband
baron
is
captain
brand
the
english
officer
who
is
billeted
in
our
the
baron
bowed
stiffly
to
brand
hope
sir
that
my
servants
are
attending
to
your
needs
in
every
way
i
beg
of
you
to
believe
that
as
an
old
soldier
i
wish
to
fulfil
my
duty
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
however
painful
the
circumstances
in
which
you
find
brand
replied
with
equal
gravity
regretting
his
intrusion
and
expressing
his
gratitude
for
the
great
courtesy
that
had
been
shown
to
him
curiously
he
told
me
he
had
a
strong
temptation
to
laugh
the
enormous
formality
of
the
reception
touched
some
sense
of
absurdity
so
that
he
wanted
to
laugh
loudly
and
wildly
probably
that
was
sheer
nervousness
me
to
present
my
son
said
the
lady
franz
von
the
young
man
came
forward
and
clicked
heels
in
the
german
fashion
but
his
way
of
shaking
hands
and
his
easy
do
you
do
were
perfectly
english
for
a
moment
brand
met
his
eyes
and
found
them
frank
and
friendly
he
had
a
vision
of
this
man
sitting
in
eileen
room
gazing
at
her
with
love
in
his
eyes
and
afterwards
embarrassed
shameful
and
immensely
sad
in
that
trial
scene
elsa
also
shook
hands
with
him
and
helped
to
break
the
hard
ice
of
ceremony
brother
is
very
glad
to
meet
you
he
was
at
oxford
you
know
come
and
sit
here
you
will
take
tea
i
am
they
had
prepared
tea
for
him
specially
and
elsa
served
it
like
an
english
girl
charmingly
brand
was
not
an
easy
conversationalist
his
drawingroom
manners
were
always
and
that
evening
in
the
german
he
felt
he
told
me
perfect
fool
and
could
think
of
no
small
talk
franz
von
kreuzenach
helped
him
out
by
talking
about
oxford
and
brand
felt
more
at
ease
when
he
found
that
the
young
german
officer
knew
some
of
his
old
college
friends
and
described
a
in
his
own
third
year
the
old
baron
sat
stiffly
listening
with
gravity
to
this
conversation
elsa
laughed
without
embarrassment
at
her
description
of
à
incident
when
the
trousers
of
a
proctor
had
been
removed
in
high
and
the
frau
von
kreuzenach
permitted
herself
a
wintry
smile
the
war
she
said
wished
our
children
to
get
an
english
education
elsa
went
to
a
school
at
brighton
we
were
very
fond
of
the
general
joined
in
the
conversation
for
the
first
time
was
a
weakness
without
offence
sir
i
think
that
our
german
youth
would
have
been
better
employed
at
german
universities
where
education
is
more
seriously
regarded
and
where
the
national
spirit
is
fostered
and
brand
announced
that
he
had
been
to
heidelberg
university
and
agreed
that
german
students
take
their
studies
more
seriously
than
english
go
to
our
universities
for
character
more
than
for
said
the
elder
von
kreuzenach
is
there
the
english
learn
their
imperialism
and
political
ambitions
from
their
point
of
view
they
are
right
english
pride
so
arrogant
is
a
great
franz
von
kreuzenach
toned
down
his
remark
father
uses
the
word
pride
in
its
best
sense
pride
of
race
and
tradition
personally
what
struck
me
most
at
oxford
was
the
absence
of
all
deliberate
philosophical
influence
the
men
were
very
free
in
their
opinions
most
of
those
in
my
set
were
and
advanced
liberals
in
a
way
but
i
fancy
most
of
them
did
not
worry
very
much
about
political
ideas
they
were
up
for
good
time
and
made
the
most
of
youth
in
sport
and
companionship
they
laughed
enormously
i
think
the
germans
laugh
too
little
we
are
lacking
in
a
national
sense
of
humour
except
of
a
coarse
and
rustic
entirely
disagree
with
you
franz
said
the
elder
man
sternly
find
my
own
sense
of
humour
sufficiently
developed
you
are
biassed
by
your
sympathy
which
i
find
extraordinary
and
regrettable
after
what
has
he
turned
to
brand
and
said
that
as
a
soldier
he
would
understand
that
courtesy
to
individuals
did
not
abolish
the
sacred
duty
of
hating
a
country
which
was
essentially
hostile
to
his
own
in
spirit
and
in
act
he
added
behaved
in
an
unforgivable
way
for
many
years
before
the
war
she
plotted
the
ruin
of
germany
in
alliance
with
russia
and
france
she
challenged
trade
interests
and
national
development
in
every
part
of
the
globe
and
built
a
great
fleet
for
the
sole
purpose
of
preventing
colonial
expansion
england
has
always
been
our
enemy
since
she
became
aware
of
our
increasing
strength
for
she
will
brook
no
rival
i
do
not
blame
her
for
that
is
the
right
of
her
national
egotism
but
as
a
true
german
i
have
always
recognised
the
inevitability
of
our
brand
had
no
need
to
answer
this
denunciation
for
elsa
von
kreuzenach
broke
into
her
speech
impatiently
are
too
bad
father
captain
brand
does
not
wish
to
spend
the
evening
in
political
argument
you
know
what
franz
and
i
think
we
believe
that
all
the
evil
of
the
war
was
caused
by
silly
old
hatred
and
greedy
rivalries
the
world
big
enough
for
the
free
development
of
all
its
peoples
if
not
then
life
is
not
worth
living
and
the
human
race
must
go
on
killing
each
other
until
the
world
is
a
agree
said
brand
looking
at
elsa
peoples
of
europe
must
resist
all
further
incitements
to
make
war
on
each
other
surely
the
american
president
has
given
us
all
a
new
philosophy
by
his
call
for
a
league
of
nations
and
his
promise
of
peace
without
vengeance
with
the
of
is
true
said
franz
von
kreuzenach
allies
are
bound
by
we
agreed
to
the
armistice
on
that
basis
and
it
is
because
of
the
promise
that
lies
in
those
clauses
the
charter
of
a
new
world
that
the
german
people
and
the
austrians
accept
their
defeat
with
resignation
and
look
forward
with
hope
in
spite
of
our
present
ruin
to
a
greater
liberty
and
to
a
more
beautiful
said
elsa
my
brother
says
captain
brand
explains
the
spirit
with
which
your
english
soldiers
have
been
received
on
the
rhine
perhaps
you
expected
hostility
hatred
black
looks
no
the
german
people
welcome
you
and
your
american
comrades
because
the
bitterness
of
defeat
is
softened
by
the
knowledge
that
there
is
to
be
no
more
bloodshed
alas
we
are
drained
of
blood
and
that
the
peace
will
begin
a
nobler
age
in
history
for
all
of
the
general
shifted
in
his
chair
so
that
it
scraped
the
polished
boards
a
deep
wave
of
colour
swept
up
to
his
bald
head
he
said
son
and
daughter
talk
of
defeat
there
was
no
defeat
the
german
armies
were
invincible
to
the
last
they
never
lost
a
battle
they
fell
back
not
because
of
their
own
failure
but
because
the
heart
of
the
german
people
was
sapped
by
the
weakness
of
hunger
caused
by
the
infamous
english
blockade
which
starved
our
women
and
children
even
our
manhood
was
weakened
by
starvation
still
more
our
civilians
were
poisoned
by
a
pestilential
heresy
learnt
in
russia
a
most
damnable
pacifism
which
destroyed
their
will
to
win
our
glorious
armies
were
stabbed
in
the
back
by
anarchy
and
is
defeat
sir
all
the
same
said
franz
von
with
grim
deference
to
his
father
us
face
the
tragedy
of
the
facts
as
an
officer
of
the
rearguard
defence
i
have
to
admit
too
that
the
german
armies
were
beaten
in
the
field
our
war
machine
was
worn
out
and
disintegrated
by
the
repeated
blows
that
struck
us
our
was
exhausted
and
we
could
no
longer
resist
the
weight
of
the
allied
armies
the
americans
had
immense
reserves
of
men
to
throw
in
against
us
we
could
only
save
ourselves
by
retreat
field
marshal
von
hindenburg
himself
has
admitted
the
face
was
no
longer
flushed
with
angry
colour
he
was
very
white
with
a
kind
of
dead
look
except
for
the
smouldering
fire
of
his
eyes
he
spoke
in
a
low
choking
voice
in
german
i
had
known
that
a
son
of
mine
bearing
the
name
of
franz
von
kreuzenach
would
have
admitted
the
defeat
of
the
german
army
before
an
officer
of
an
enemy
power
i
would
have
strangled
him
at
he
grasped
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
made
one
or
two
efforts
to
rise
but
could
not
do
so
he
commanded
harshly
to
his
wife
me
your
arm
this
officer
will
excuse
me
i
trust
i
feel
franz
von
kreuzenach
went
quickly
over
to
his
father
before
his
mother
could
rise
i
deeply
regret
having
pained
you
the
truth
is
tragic
enough
the
old
man
answered
him
ferociously
have
not
spoken
truth
but
lies
you
are
a
disgrace
to
the
rank
of
a
german
officer
and
to
my
name
you
have
been
infected
by
the
poison
of
socialism
and
anarchy
anna
your
arm
mother
stooped
over
her
husband
and
lifted
his
hand
to
her
lips
lieber
she
said
very
softly
the
old
man
rose
stiffly
leaning
on
his
arm
and
bowed
to
brand
beg
you
to
excuse
me
sir
as
a
german
soldier
i
do
not
admit
the
words
or
even
when
spoken
within
my
own
household
the
german
army
has
never
been
defeated
and
has
never
retreated
except
according
to
plan
i
wish
you
brand
was
standing
and
bowed
to
the
general
in
silence
it
was
a
silence
which
lasted
after
the
husband
and
wife
had
left
the
room
the
girl
elsa
was
mopping
her
eyes
franz
von
kreuzenach
stood
very
pale
by
the
empty
chair
in
which
his
father
had
sat
he
was
the
first
to
speak
awfully
sorry
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
like
that
before
my
father
he
belongs
to
the
old
brand
told
me
that
he
felt
abominably
uncomfortable
and
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
not
been
billeted
in
this
german
house
elsa
rose
quickly
and
put
her
hand
on
her
arm
am
glad
you
spoke
as
you
did
franz
it
is
hateful
to
hurt
our
dear
father
but
it
is
necessary
to
tell
the
truth
now
or
we
can
not
save
ourselves
and
there
will
be
no
new
era
in
the
world
it
is
the
younger
generation
that
must
the
world
and
that
can
not
be
done
if
we
yield
to
old
falsehoods
and
go
the
way
of
old
franz
raised
his
hand
to
his
lips
and
brand
told
me
that
his
heart
softened
at
the
sight
of
that
caress
as
it
had
when
mother
kissed
the
hand
of
her
old
husband
it
seemed
to
him
symbolical
of
the
two
generations
standing
together
the
old
against
the
young
the
young
against
the
old
england
also
he
said
have
those
who
stand
by
hate
and
those
who
would
break
with
the
old
traditions
and
forget
as
soon
as
possible
old
is
the
new
conflict
said
franz
von
kreuzenach
solemnly
will
divide
the
world
and
many
houses
as
gospel
divided
father
from
son
and
it
is
the
new
new
hope
said
elsa
passionately
brand
made
an
early
excuse
to
retire
to
his
room
and
franz
von
kreuzenach
conducted
him
upstairs
and
carried
his
candlestick
said
brand
in
the
doorway
of
his
room
then
suddenly
he
remembered
eileen
letter
and
put
his
hand
into
his
for
his
case
have
a
letter
for
you
he
said
the
young
german
was
surprised
a
lady
in
lille
said
brand
eileen
franz
von
kreuzenach
started
violently
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
was
incapable
of
speech
when
he
took
the
letter
from
brand
his
hand
trembled
know
her
he
said
at
last
knew
her
in
old
days
and
met
her
in
lille
answered
brand
told
me
of
your
kindness
to
her
i
promised
to
thank
you
when
i
met
you
i
do
so
he
held
out
his
hand
and
franz
von
kreuzenach
grasped
it
in
a
hard
grip
is
well
he
asked
with
deep
emotion
and
happy
said
brand
is
the
young
german
was
immensely
embarrassed
absurdly
and
shy
lille
he
said
had
the
honour
of
her
told
me
answered
brand
saw
some
of
your
songs
in
her
i
sang
to
franz
von
kreuzenach
laughed
awkwardly
then
suddenly
a
look
of
something
like
fear
certainly
alarm
changed
his
expression
must
beg
of
you
to
keep
secret
any
knowledge
of
my
my
friendship
with
that
lady
she
acted
rashly
if
it
were
known
even
by
my
father
that
i
did
what
i
did
my
honour
perhaps
even
my
life
would
be
unsafe
you
understand
i
am
said
brand
a
german
officer
said
franz
von
kreuzenach
took
great
he
emphasised
his
words
a
german
officer
i
took
liberties
with
my
duty
because
of
a
higher
higher
law
than
discipline
said
brand
a
nobler
duty
than
the
code
of
a
german
he
spoke
with
a
touch
of
irony
but
franz
von
kreuzenach
was
unconscious
of
that
duty
to
god
he
said
gravely
pity
an
expression
of
immense
sentiment
filled
his
eyes
an
englishman
would
have
masked
it
more
guardedly
said
brand
thanks
the
young
german
clicked
his
heels
and
bowed
brand
went
to
bed
in
a
leisurely
way
and
before
sleeping
heard
a
violin
being
played
in
the
room
above
his
own
by
the
tune
he
remembered
the
words
of
an
old
song
as
eileen
had
sung
it
in
lille
and
as
he
had
learnt
it
in
his
own
home
before
the
war
one
that
is
pure
as
an
angel
and
fair
as
the
flowers
of
may
they
call
her
the
gentle
maiden
wherever
she
takes
her
franz
von
kreuzenach
was
having
an
orgy
of
sentiment
and
brand
somehow
envied
him
v
our
entry
into
cologne
and
life
among
the
people
whom
we
had
been
fighting
for
four
years
and
more
was
an
amazing
psychological
experience
and
not
one
of
us
there
on
the
rhine
could
escape
its
subtle
influence
upon
our
opinions
and
subconscious
state
of
mind
some
of
our
officers
i
am
sure
were
utterly
unaware
of
the
change
being
wrought
in
them
by
daily
association
with
german
civilians
they
did
not
realise
how
day
by
day
their
old
beliefs
on
the
subject
of
were
being
broken
down
by
contact
with
people
who
behaved
with
dignity
for
the
most
part
and
according
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
human
nature
charles
fortune
our
humorist
delighted
to
observe
these
things
and
his
irony
found
ready
targets
in
cologne
both
among
british
officers
and
german
civilians
neither
of
whom
he
spared
i
remember
that
i
was
walking
one
day
down
hohestrasse
with
young
harding
after
the
proclamation
had
been
issued
and
enforced
with
numerous
arrests
and
fines
by
the
and
the
military
police
that
all
german
civilians
were
to
salute
british
officers
by
doffing
their
hats
in
the
streets
the
absurdity
of
it
was
so
great
that
in
a
crowded
the
hohestrasse
the
civilian
people
would
have
had
to
remain
bareheaded
owing
to
the
constant
passing
of
our
officers
fortune
saluted
harding
and
myself
not
only
with
one
hand
but
with
two
he
wore
his
face
wonderfully
noble
and
mystical
great
and
glorious
is
the
british
army
he
said
immense
are
the
power
and
majesty
of
the
temporary
lieutenant
for
four
years
and
a
half
have
we
fought
to
crush
militarism
nine
hundred
thousand
men
of
ours
have
died
explosive
deaths
in
order
to
abolish
the
philosophy
of
zabernism
you
remember
the
claim
of
the
military
caste
to
the
servility
of
civilian
salutes
two
million
men
of
ours
are
blind
crippled
as
martyrs
for
democracy
made
free
of
junkerdom
by
the
crushing
of
the
hun
now
by
a
slight
error
in
logic
the
beautiful
inconsistency
of
our
english
character
we
arrest
fine
or
imprison
any
german
man
or
child
who
does
not
bare
his
head
before
a
little
english
subaltern
from
peckham
rye
or
tooting
in
a
cap
how
great
and
good
we
are
how
free
from
hypocrisy
how
splendid
our
victory
for
the
little
peoples
of
the
earth
young
harding
who
had
been
returning
salutes
solemnly
and
mechanically
to
great
numbers
of
germans
flushed
a
little
suppose
necessary
to
enforce
respect
all
the
same
a
horrid
fortune
wagged
his
hand
behind
his
ear
to
an
elderly
german
who
took
off
his
bowler
hat
the
man
stared
at
him
in
a
frightened
way
as
though
the
english
officer
had
suddenly
gone
mad
and
might
bite
him
said
fortune
yet
have
they
been
taught
the
beauty
of
the
salute
that
man
ought
to
be
put
into
a
dark
cell
with
bread
and
water
and
torture
from
till
on
wednesdays
and
fortune
was
vastly
entertained
by
the
sight
of
british
soldiers
walking
about
with
german
families
in
whose
houses
they
were
billeted
some
of
them
were
with
german
girls
a
was
carrying
a
small
boy
on
whose
cap
was
the
word
said
fortune
looking
sternly
at
harding
spite
of
all
our
atrocity
tales
our
propaganda
of
righteous
hate
our
training
of
the
young
idea
that
a
hun
must
be
killed
at
sight
only
good
german
is
a
dead
german
as
you
remember
harding
these
soldiers
of
ours
are
fraternising
with
the
enemy
and
flirting
with
the
daughters
and
carrying
infant
huns
look
at
that
forgetting
all
my
propaganda
surely
he
ought
to
cut
the
throat
of
that
baby
hindenburg
my
heart
aches
for
bill
the
butcher
of
the
boche
all
his
work
undone
all
his
fury
fizzled
sad
sad
harding
looked
profoundly
uncomfortable
at
this
sarcasm
he
was
billeted
with
a
german
family
who
treated
him
as
an
honoured
friend
the
mother
a
dear
old
soul
as
he
reluctantly
admitted
brought
him
an
early
cup
of
tea
in
the
morning
with
his
three
times
he
had
refused
it
remembering
his
oath
never
to
accept
a
favour
from
male
or
female
hun
on
the
fourth
time
his
weakened
under
the
old
anxious
solicitations
and
his
desire
for
the
luxury
of
tea
before
dressing
he
said
and
afterwards
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
his
feeble
resistance
he
was
alarmed
at
his
own
change
of
heart
towards
these
people
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
draw
back
solemnly
or
with
pompous
and
aloof
dignity
when
the
old
grandchild
a
little
girl
of
six
waylaid
him
in
the
hall
dropped
a
curtsey
in
the
pretty
german
style
and
then
ran
forward
to
kiss
his
hand
and
say
tag
herr
offizier
he
bought
a
box
of
chocolate
for
her
in
the
hohestrasse
and
then
walked
with
it
irresolutely
tempted
to
throw
it
into
the
rhine
or
to
give
it
to
a
passing
tommy
later
he
presented
it
to
little
elizabeth
who
received
it
with
a
cry
of
delight
and
jumping
on
to
his
knee
kissed
him
effusively
on
both
cheeks
young
harding
adored
children
but
felt
as
guilty
at
these
german
kisses
as
though
he
had
betrayed
his
country
and
his
faith
one
thing
which
acted
in
favour
of
the
germans
was
the
lack
of
manners
displayed
by
some
young
english
officers
in
the
hotels
restaurants
and
shops
in
all
armies
there
are
cads
and
ours
was
not
without
them
though
they
were
rare
the
conditions
of
our
military
occupation
with
absolute
authority
over
the
civilian
people
provided
a
unique
opportunity
for
the
caddish
instincts
of
youth
they
came
swaggering
into
cologne
determined
to
it
across
the
and
stand
no
so
they
bullied
frightened
waiters
rapped
their
sticks
on
insulted
german
and
talked
loudly
about
in
restaurants
where
many
germans
could
hear
and
understand
harding
fortune
and
i
were
in
the
domhof
hotel
when
one
such
scene
occurred
a
group
of
noisy
subalterns
were
disputing
the
cost
of
their
meal
and
refusing
to
pay
for
the
wine
stole
all
the
wine
in
lille
shouted
one
lieutenant
of
ours
damned
if
pay
for
wine
in
stole
no
wine
in
lille
sir
said
the
waiter
politely
was
never
you
insult
english
officers
said
one
of
the
other
subalterns
are
here
to
tread
on
your
fortune
looked
at
me
and
raised
his
a
good
imitation
he
said
they
want
to
play
the
game
of
frightfulness
they
really
ought
to
do
better
than
that
they
even
make
the
right
kind
of
harding
spoke
bitterly
cads
somebody
ought
to
put
them
under
really
impress
the
germans
said
fortune
know
only
you
see
the
foolish
boys
are
paying
their
bill
now
if
i
or
bill
were
to
do
the
junker
stunt
we
should
at
least
look
the
real
he
frowned
horribly
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
growled
and
grumbled
with
an
air
of
senile
ferocity
to
the
great
delight
of
a
young
german
waiter
watching
him
from
a
corner
of
the
room
and
already
aware
that
fortune
was
a
humorist
the
few
cads
among
us
caused
a
reaction
in
the
minds
of
all
men
of
good
manners
so
that
they
took
the
part
of
the
germans
even
various
regulations
and
restrictions
ordered
by
the
military
governor
during
the
first
few
months
of
our
occupation
were
resented
more
by
british
officers
and
men
than
by
the
germans
themselves
the
opera
was
closed
and
british
officers
said
preposterous
nonsense
how
are
the
poor
devils
going
to
earn
their
living
and
how
are
we
going
to
amuse
ourselves
the
and
restaurants
were
ordered
to
shut
down
at
ten
and
again
the
british
army
of
occupation
exceedingly
and
said
thought
this
war
had
been
fought
for
liberty
why
all
this
petty
tyranny
presently
these
places
were
allowed
to
stay
open
till
eleven
and
all
the
way
down
the
hohestrasse
as
eleven
struck
one
saw
groups
of
british
officers
and
men
and
french
and
american
officers
pouring
out
of
a
kunstler
conzert
or
with
farewell
greetings
or
promises
of
further
rendezvous
with
laughing
german
girls
who
seemed
to
learn
english
by
magic
said
young
harding
who
was
a
married
man
with
a
pretty
wife
in
england
for
whom
he
yearned
with
a
which
he
revealed
to
me
boyishly
when
we
became
closer
friends
in
this
german
city
disgraceful
said
the
little
american
doctor
who
had
joined
us
in
cologne
only
the
fulfilment
of
law
which
makes
man
desire
woman
allah
is
great
but
juxtaposition
is
small
was
friends
with
all
of
us
and
there
was
not
one
among
our
crowd
who
had
not
an
affection
and
admiration
for
this
little
man
whose
honesty
was
transparent
and
whose
vital
nervous
energy
was
like
a
fresh
wind
to
any
company
in
which
he
found
himself
it
was
wickham
brand
however
who
had
captured
the
heart
most
of
all
and
i
think
i
was
his
anyhow
it
was
to
me
that
he
revealed
his
opinion
of
brand
and
some
of
his
most
intimate
thoughts
has
the
quality
of
greatness
he
said
mean
to
say
great
now
not
at
all
i
think
fumbling
and
groping
not
sure
of
himself
afraid
of
his
best
instincts
thinking
his
worst
may
be
right
but
one
day
he
will
straighten
all
that
out
and
have
a
call
as
loud
as
a
trumpet
what
i
like
is
his
moodiness
and
bad
taste
doctor
i
remarked
old
brand
is
in
the
sulks
nothing
doing
with
him
like
a
bear
with
a
sore
said
small
exactly
it
he
is
biting
his
own
sore
ear
i
guess
with
him
though
a
sore
heart
he
keeps
moping
and
fretting
and
let
his
wounds
heal
what
makes
him
different
from
most
others
especially
you
english
you
go
through
frightful
experiences
and
then
forget
them
and
say
old
world
young
fellah
come
and
have
a
you
see
civilisation
rocking
like
a
boat
in
a
storm
but
you
say
in
your
english
way
worry
wickham
worries
he
wants
to
put
things
right
and
make
the
world
safer
for
the
next
crowd
he
thinks
of
the
boys
who
will
have
to
fight
in
the
next
war
wants
to
save
them
from
his
frightfully
sensitive
underneath
his
mask
of
ruggedness
i
said
romantic
said
the
doctor
yes
that
girl
eileen
churned
up
his
heart
all
right
you
see
the
worship
in
his
eyes
it
made
me
feel
i
laughed
at
the
little
doctor
and
accused
him
of
romanticism
i
said
more
seriously
is
not
without
romance
herself
and
i
know
what
she
wrote
in
that
letter
to
franz
von
kreuzenach
but
i
suspect
she
an
episode
which
had
best
be
closed
as
for
brand
i
think
asking
for
trouble
of
the
same
kind
if
he
sees
much
of
that
girl
elsa
i
answer
for
him
amazingly
pretty
and
full
of
charm
from
what
brand
tells
guess
be
a
darned
fool
if
he
fixes
up
with
that
girl
growled
the
doctor
inconsistent
i
said
you
shocked
that
wickham
brand
should
fall
in
love
with
a
german
girl
at
all
sonny
said
small
a
biologist
i
know
you
interfere
with
natural
selection
and
a
pretty
girl
is
an
alluring
creature
whether
she
speaks
german
or
icelandic
but
this
girl
elsa
von
kreuzenach
is
not
up
to
a
high
standard
of
i
was
amused
by
the
scientific
disapproval
wrong
with
her
i
asked
when
did
you
meet
her
said
the
doctor
do
you
think
been
doing
all
these
weeks
in
cologne
drinking
coffee
at
the
domhof
hotel
with
the
and
his
watching
the
every
evening
in
like
this
we
sat
in
a
as
we
talked
for
the
sake
of
light
and
a
little
music
it
was
typical
of
a
score
of
others
in
cologne
with
settees
of
oak
divided
from
each
other
in
hung
with
draperies
of
green
and
red
silk
and
little
tables
to
which
waiters
brought
relays
of
rhine
wines
in
tall
thin
bottles
for
the
thirstiness
of
german
civilians
and
british
officers
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
small
stage
and
an
orchestra
composed
of
a
pianist
who
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
a
mild
form
of
judging
from
a
convulsive
twitch
a
young
who
played
the
fiddle
squeakily
and
a
thin
girl
behind
a
every
now
and
then
a
man
in
evening
clothes
mounted
the
stage
and
begged
the
attention
of
the
company
for
a
dance
by
the
artist
fraulein
from
behind
a
curtain
near
the
came
a
in
the
usual
ballet
dress
and
the
usual
fixed
and
senseless
smile
who
proceeded
to
perform
pavlova
effects
on
a
stage
two
yards
square
while
the
young
jew
fiddler
flattened
himself
against
the
side
curtain
with
a
restricted
use
of
his
bow
and
the
pianist
with
the
lurched
sideways
as
he
played
to
avoid
her
floppy
skirts
and
the
girl
behind
the
drew
deep
chords
with
a
look
of
misery
are
pretty
dull
spots
i
said
to
the
little
doctor
where
have
you
been
spending
your
time
and
when
did
you
meet
elsa
von
kreuzenach
small
told
me
that
he
had
been
seeking
knowledge
in
the
only
place
where
he
could
study
social
health
and
social
disease
hospitals
slum
tenements
he
was
scornful
of
english
officers
and
correspondents
who
summed
up
the
social
state
of
germany
after
a
stroll
down
the
hohestrasse
a
gorge
of
pastry
he
said
in
the
and
a
dinner
of
four
courses
in
a
big
hotel
on
smuggled
food
at
fantastic
prices
might
as
well
judge
germany
by
the
guzzling
swine
in
this
place
as
england
by
a
party
of
profiteers
at
brighton
the
poor
and
the
labourers
stay
indoors
after
their
job
and
do
not
exhibit
their
misery
in
the
public
misery
i
asked
small
glowered
at
me
through
his
goggles
and
see
come
and
see
the
mothers
who
have
no
milk
for
their
babes
and
the
babes
who
are
bulbousheaded
with
rickets
come
and
see
the
tenement
lodgings
where
working
families
sit
round
cabbage
soup
as
their
chief
meal
with
bread
that
ties
their
entrails
into
knots
but
gives
a
sense
of
fulness
not
enjoyed
by
those
who
have
no
bread
man
awful
it
tears
at
heart
but
you
go
into
the
slums
to
find
hunger
four
years
of
which
has
weakened
growing
girls
so
that
they
swoon
at
their
work
or
fall
asleep
through
weakness
in
the
tram
cars
in
many
of
the
big
houses
where
life
looks
so
comfortable
from
which
women
come
out
in
furs
looking
so
rich
these
german
people
have
not
enough
to
eat
and
what
they
eat
is
manufactured
in
the
shop
and
the
factories
i
found
that
out
from
that
girl
elsa
von
i
asked
is
a
nurse
in
a
poor
child
showed
me
round
with
a
in
her
eyes
while
all
the
scrofulous
kiddies
cried
tag
guten
tag
like
the
quacking
of
ducks
she
said
will
be
no
more
milk
for
them
what
can
we
do
for
them
then
doctor
they
will
wither
and
those
were
her
words
and
i
saw
her
sadness
i
saw
something
else
presently
i
saw
her
sway
a
little
and
she
fell
like
that
girl
marthe
on
the
doorstep
at
lille
the
love
of
mike
i
said
and
when
she
pulled
round
bullied
her
did
you
have
for
breakfast
i
asked
coffee
she
said
laughing
a
bit
of
bread
a
good
be
hanged
i
said
did
you
have
for
lunch
soup
and
kleines
she
says
four
years
one
gets
used
to
will
you
have
for
dinner
said
i
not
liking
the
look
of
things
laughed
as
though
she
saw
a
funny
joke
soup
and
turnips
she
said
a
regular
thought
your
father
was
a
baron
i
remarked
in
my
sarcastic
way
true
she
says
an
honest
man
he
is
and
therefore
poor
it
is
only
the
profiteers
who
feed
well
in
germany
all
through
the
war
they
waxed
fat
on
the
of
the
men
who
fought
and
died
now
they
steal
the
food
of
the
poor
by
bribing
the
peasants
to
sell
their
produce
at
any
is
the
word
she
used
that
means
it
also
means
torture
i
hope
for
those
who
do
it
so
there
you
are
if
wickham
brand
marries
elsa
von
he
marries
a
girl
whose
health
has
been
undermined
by
four
what
do
you
think
their
children
will
be
rickety
tuberculous
undersized
wickham
brand
deserves
better
luck
than
that
i
roared
with
laughter
at
the
little
doctor
and
told
him
he
was
looking
too
far
ahead
as
far
as
brand
and
the
german
girl
were
concerned
this
made
him
angry
in
his
humorous
way
and
he
told
me
that
those
who
look
ahead
fail
to
see
the
trouble
under
their
nose
until
they
fall
over
it
we
left
the
through
a
fog
of
smoke
another
dancing
girl
was
on
the
tiny
stage
waving
her
arms
and
legs
an
english
officer
slightly
fuddled
was
writing
a
cheque
for
his
bill
and
persuading
the
german
manager
to
accept
it
two
young
french
officers
were
staring
at
the
with
hostile
eyes
five
young
germans
were
noisy
round
six
tall
bottles
of
the
doctor
and
i
walked
down
to
the
bank
of
the
rhine
below
the
hohenzollern
bridge
our
sentries
were
there
guarding
heavy
guns
which
thrust
their
snouts
up
from
tarpaulin
covers
two
german
women
passed
with
dragging
footsteps
and
one
said
wearily
lieber
gott
the
doctor
was
silent
for
some
time
after
his
long
monologue
he
stared
across
the
rhine
on
whose
black
surface
lights
glimmered
with
a
milky
radiance
presently
he
spoke
again
and
i
remember
his
words
which
were
in
a
way
prophetic
german
people
are
broken
they
to
be
broken
they
are
punished
they
to
be
punished
because
they
obeyed
the
call
of
their
leaders
which
was
to
evil
their
power
has
been
overthrown
and
their
race
made
weak
you
and
i
an
englishman
an
american
stand
here
by
right
of
victory
overlooking
this
river
which
has
flowed
through
two
thousand
years
of
german
history
it
has
seen
the
of
the
german
people
their
industry
their
genius
their
racial
consciousness
it
has
been
in
the
rhythm
of
their
poetry
and
has
made
the
melody
of
their
songs
on
its
banks
lived
the
little
people
of
german
and
the
heroes
of
their
legends
now
there
are
english
guns
ready
to
fire
across
the
water
and
english
french
and
american
soldiers
pacing
this
road
along
the
rhine
as
victors
and
guards
of
victory
what
hurt
to
the
pride
of
this
people
what
a
downfall
we
must
be
glad
of
that
because
the
german
challenge
to
the
world
was
not
to
be
endured
by
free
peoples
that
is
true
and
nothing
can
ever
alter
its
truth
or
make
it
seem
false
i
stand
firm
by
that
faith
but
i
see
also
what
before
i
did
not
see
that
many
of
these
germans
were
but
slaves
of
a
system
which
they
could
not
change
and
spellbound
by
old
traditions
old
belonging
to
the
soul
of
their
race
so
that
when
they
were
spoken
they
had
to
offer
their
lives
in
sacrifice
high
powers
above
them
arranged
their
destiny
and
the
manner
and
measure
of
their
sacrifice
and
they
had
no
voice
or
strength
or
knowledge
to
protest
these
german
peasants
these
boys
who
fought
these
women
and
children
who
suffered
and
starved
now
it
is
they
the
ignorant
and
the
innocent
who
must
go
on
suffering
paying
in
peace
for
what
their
rulers
did
in
war
men
will
say
that
is
the
justice
of
god
i
can
see
no
loving
work
in
the
starvation
of
babes
nor
in
the
weakening
of
women
so
that
mothers
have
no
milk
i
see
only
the
cruelty
of
men
it
is
certain
now
that
having
won
the
war
we
must
be
merciful
in
peace
we
must
relieve
the
blockade
which
is
still
starving
these
people
we
must
not
go
out
for
vengeance
but
rather
to
rescue
for
this
war
has
involved
the
civilian
populations
of
europe
and
is
not
limited
to
armies
a
treaty
of
peace
will
be
with
famine
and
plague
rather
than
with
defeated
generals
and
humiliated
diplomats
if
we
make
a
military
peace
without
regard
to
the
agonies
of
peoples
there
will
be
a
tragic
price
to
pay
by
victors
as
well
as
by
vanquished
for
the
victors
are
weak
too
their
strength
was
nearly
spent
they
except
my
people
were
panting
to
the
last
gasp
when
their
enemy
fell
at
last
they
need
a
peace
of
reconciliation
for
their
own
sakes
because
no
new
frontiers
may
save
them
from
sharing
the
ruin
of
those
they
destroy
nor
the
disease
of
those
they
starve
america
alone
comes
out
of
the
war
strong
and
rich
for
that
reason
we
have
the
power
to
shape
the
destiny
of
the
human
race
and
to
heal
as
far
as
may
be
the
wounds
of
the
world
it
is
our
chance
in
history
the
most
supreme
chance
that
any
race
has
had
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
all
nations
are
looking
to
president
wilson
to
help
them
out
of
the
abyss
and
to
make
a
peace
which
shall
lead
the
people
out
of
the
dark
jungle
of
europe
my
god
if
wilson
will
be
noble
and
wise
and
strong
he
may
alter
the
face
of
the
world
and
win
such
victory
as
no
mortal
leader
ever
gained
if
not
if
not
there
will
be
anguish
unspeakable
and
a
worse
darkness
and
a
welter
of
anarchy
out
of
whose
madness
new
wars
will
be
bred
until
civilisation
drops
back
to
savagery
or
disappears
am
afraid
he
spoke
those
last
words
with
a
terrible
thrill
in
his
rather
high
harsh
voice
and
i
too
standing
there
in
the
darkness
by
the
rhine
had
a
sense
of
mighty
powers
at
work
with
the
destiny
of
many
peoples
and
of
risks
and
chances
and
hatreds
and
stupidities
thwarting
the
purpose
of
noble
minds
and
humble
hearts
after
this
four
massacre
and
i
was
afraid
vi
symptoms
of
restless
impatience
which
had
appeared
almost
as
soon
as
the
signing
of
the
armistice
began
to
grow
with
intensity
among
all
soldiers
who
had
been
long
in
the
zone
of
war
their
patience
so
enduring
through
the
bad
years
broke
at
last
they
wanted
to
go
home
desperately
they
wanted
to
get
back
to
civil
life
in
civil
clothes
with
the
armistice
all
meaning
had
gone
out
of
their
khaki
uniform
out
of
military
discipline
out
of
distinctions
of
rank
and
out
of
the
whole
system
of
their
life
they
had
done
the
dirty
job
they
had
faced
all
its
risks
and
they
had
gained
what
glory
there
might
be
in
human
courage
now
they
desired
to
get
back
to
their
own
people
and
their
own
places
and
the
old
ways
of
life
and
liberty
they
remembered
the
terms
of
their
service
these
amateurs
who
had
answered
the
call
in
early
days
the
duration
of
the
well
the
war
was
finished
there
was
to
be
no
more
fighting
and
the
wife
wanted
her
man
and
the
mother
her
son
became
the
word
of
hope
and
many
men
were
sullen
at
the
delays
which
kept
them
in
exile
and
in
servitude
the
men
sent
deputations
to
their
officers
the
officers
pulled
wires
for
themselves
which
tinkled
little
bells
as
far
away
as
the
war
office
whitehall
if
they
had
a
strong
enough
pull
one
by
one
friends
of
mine
slipped
away
after
a
word
of
farewell
and
a
cheerful
grin
back
to
civvies
home
harding
was
one
of
those
who
agonised
for
civil
liberty
and
release
from
military
restraint
and
the
reason
of
it
lay
in
his
where
there
was
the
photograph
of
a
pretty
girl
his
wife
we
had
become
good
friends
and
he
confided
to
me
many
things
about
his
state
of
mind
with
a
simplicity
and
a
sincerity
which
made
me
like
him
i
never
met
a
man
more
english
in
all
his
characteristics
or
more
typical
of
the
quality
which
belongs
to
our
strength
and
our
weakness
as
a
harrow
boy
his
manners
were
perfect
according
to
the
english
code
quiet
unemotional
easy
unobtrusively
thoughtful
of
other
comfort
in
little
things
according
to
the
french
code
he
would
have
been
considered
cold
arrogant
conceited
and
stupid
certainly
he
had
that
touch
of
arrogance
which
is
in
all
englishmen
of
the
old
tradition
all
his
education
and
environment
had
taught
him
to
believe
that
english
civilisation
especially
in
the
hunting
set
was
perfect
and
supreme
he
had
a
pity
rather
than
contempt
for
those
unlucky
enough
to
be
born
frenchmen
italians
or
of
any
other
race
he
was
not
stupid
by
nature
on
the
contrary
he
had
sound
judgment
on
matters
within
his
range
of
knowledge
and
a
rapid
grasp
of
detail
but
his
vision
was
shut
in
by
those
frontiers
of
thought
which
limit
life
in
england
and
certain
sets
at
oxford
who
do
not
break
free
and
do
not
wish
to
break
free
from
the
conventional
formula
of
form
which
regulates
every
movement
of
their
brain
as
well
as
every
action
of
their
lives
it
is
in
its
way
a
noble
formula
and
makes
for
aristocracy
my
country
right
or
wrong
loyalty
to
king
and
state
the
divine
right
of
the
british
race
to
rule
uncivilised
peoples
for
their
own
good
the
undoubted
fact
that
an
english
gentleman
is
the
noblest
work
of
god
the
duties
of
in
courage
in
sacrifice
in
good
maimers
and
in
playing
the
game
whatever
the
game
may
be
in
a
sporting
spirit
when
i
was
in
company
i
knew
that
it
was
ridiculous
to
discuss
any
subject
which
lay
beyond
that
formula
it
was
impossible
to
suggest
that
england
had
ever
been
guilty
of
the
slightest
injustice
a
touch
of
greed
or
a
tinge
of
hypocrisy
or
something
less
than
wisdom
to
him
that
was
just
talk
a
plea
for
the
better
understanding
of
ireland
for
a
generous
measure
of
would
have
roused
him
to
a
hot
outburst
of
anger
the
irish
to
him
were
all
treacherous
disloyal
blackguards
and
the
only
remedy
of
the
irish
problem
was
he
thought
martial
law
and
demonstrations
stern
and
if
need
be
terrible
i
did
not
argue
with
him
or
chaff
him
as
some
of
his
comrades
did
and
keeping
within
the
prescribed
limits
of
conversation
set
by
his
code
we
got
on
together
admirably
once
only
in
those
days
on
the
rhine
did
harding
show
an
emotion
which
would
have
been
condemned
by
his
code
it
was
due
no
doubt
to
that
nervous
fever
which
made
some
wag
change
the
word
into
he
had
a
room
in
the
domhof
hotel
and
invited
me
to
drink
a
whiskey
with
him
there
one
evening
when
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
while
he
dispensed
the
drink
i
noticed
on
his
a
large
photograph
of
a
girl
in
evening
dress
a
wonderfully
pretty
girl
i
thought
he
caught
my
glance
and
after
a
hesitation
and
a
visible
blush
said
wife
we
were
married
before
i
came
out
two
years
ago
he
put
his
hand
into
the
of
his
tunic
and
pulling
out
a
opened
it
with
a
snap
and
showed
me
another
photograph
a
better
one
of
i
congratulated
him
but
without
listening
to
my
words
he
asked
me
rather
awkwardly
whether
i
could
pull
any
strings
for
him
to
get
all
a
question
of
he
said
not
good
at
that
kind
of
thing
but
i
want
to
get
does
i
said
i
know
and
of
course
i
want
to
play
the
game
and
all
that
but
the
fact
is
my
wife
only
a
kid
you
know
is
rather
hipped
with
my
long
absence
been
trying
to
keep
herself
merry
and
bright
and
all
that
with
the
usual
kind
of
you
know
charity
bazaars
balls
for
the
wounded
red
cross
work
and
all
that
very
plucky
too
but
the
fact
is
some
of
her
letters
lately
have
been
rather
well
rather
below
par
you
know
rather
chippy
and
all
that
the
fact
is
old
man
been
too
much
alone
and
anything
you
can
do
in
the
way
of
a
pull
at
the
war
office
i
told
him
bluntly
that
i
had
as
much
influence
at
the
war
office
as
the
charwoman
in
room
or
any
other
old
room
not
so
much
and
he
was
damped
and
apologised
for
troubling
me
however
i
promised
to
write
to
the
one
high
bird
with
whom
i
had
a
slight
acquaintance
and
this
cheered
him
up
considerably
i
stayed
chatting
for
some
time
the
usual
and
it
was
only
when
i
said
that
he
broached
another
subject
which
interested
me
a
good
deal
getting
a
bit
worried
about
wickham
brand
he
remarked
in
a
casual
kind
of
way
that
i
gathered
from
vague
disjointed
sentences
that
brand
was
falling
into
the
clutches
of
a
german
hussy
he
had
seen
them
together
at
the
opera
they
had
met
as
if
by
accident
and
one
evening
he
had
seen
them
together
down
by
the
rhine
outside
cologne
he
was
bound
to
admit
the
girl
was
remarkably
and
that
made
her
all
the
more
dangerous
he
hated
to
mention
this
as
it
seemed
like
about
of
the
best
but
he
was
frightfully
disturbed
by
the
thought
that
brand
of
all
men
should
fall
a
victim
to
the
wiles
of
a
he
knew
people
at
home
sir
amyas
brand
the
member
of
parliament
and
his
mother
who
was
a
daughter
of
the
harringtons
they
would
be
enormously
if
wickham
were
to
do
anything
foolish
it
was
only
because
he
knew
that
i
was
best
chum
that
he
told
me
these
things
in
the
strictest
confidence
a
word
of
warning
from
me
might
save
old
brand
from
getting
into
a
horrible
mess
all
i
fears
but
when
i
left
him
to
go
to
my
own
billet
i
pondered
over
his
words
and
knew
that
there
was
truth
in
them
there
was
no
doubt
to
my
mind
that
brand
was
in
love
with
elsa
von
kreuzenach
at
least
he
was
going
through
some
queer
emotional
phase
connected
with
her
entry
into
his
life
and
he
was
not
happy
about
it
though
it
excited
him
the
very
day
after
harding
spoke
to
me
on
the
subject
i
was
involuntarily
a
spy
upon
brand
and
fraülein
elsa
on
a
journey
when
we
were
though
they
were
utterly
unaware
of
my
presence
it
was
in
one
of
the
long
electric
trams
which
go
without
a
stop
from
cologne
to
bonn
i
did
not
see
brand
until
i
had
taken
my
seat
in
the
small
smoking
car
several
germans
were
there
and
i
was
wedged
between
two
of
them
in
a
corner
brand
and
a
girl
whom
i
guessed
to
be
elsa
von
kreuzenach
were
on
the
opposite
seat
but
farthest
away
from
me
and
screened
a
little
by
a
german
lady
with
a
large
feathered
hat
if
brand
had
looked
round
the
compartment
he
would
have
seen
me
at
once
and
i
waited
to
nod
to
him
but
never
once
did
he
glance
my
way
but
turned
slightly
sideways
towards
the
girl
so
that
i
only
saw
his
profile
her
face
was
in
the
same
way
turned
a
little
to
him
and
i
could
see
every
shade
of
expression
which
revealed
her
moods
as
she
talked
and
the
varying
light
in
her
eyes
she
was
certainly
a
pretty
thing
exquisite
even
in
delicacy
of
colour
and
fineness
of
feature
with
that
hair
of
hers
though
i
thought
remembering
words
that
she
had
a
worn
and
fragile
look
which
robbed
her
of
the
final
touch
of
beauty
for
some
time
they
exchanged
only
a
few
words
now
and
then
which
i
could
not
hear
and
i
was
reading
a
book
when
i
heard
brand
say
in
his
clear
rather
harsh
voice
your
people
be
anxious
about
you
the
girl
answered
in
a
low
voice
i
glanced
up
and
saw
that
she
was
smiling
not
at
brand
but
at
the
countryside
which
seemed
to
travel
past
us
as
the
tram
went
on
its
way
it
was
the
smile
of
a
girl
to
whom
life
meant
something
good
just
then
brand
spoke
again
should
hate
to
let
your
mother
think
that
i
have
been
disloyal
to
her
confidence
let
this
friendship
of
ours
be
spoilt
by
secrecy
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
he
laughed
in
a
way
that
was
strange
to
me
there
was
a
note
of
joy
in
it
it
was
a
laugh
and
brand
had
gone
beyond
boyhood
in
the
war
i
saw
one
or
two
of
the
germans
look
up
at
him
curiously
and
then
stare
at
the
girl
not
in
a
friendly
way
she
was
unconscious
of
their
gaze
though
a
wave
of
colour
swept
her
face
for
a
second
she
laid
her
hand
on
brown
fist
and
it
was
a
quick
caress
friendship
is
good
she
said
she
spoke
these
words
very
softly
in
almost
a
whisper
but
i
heard
them
in
spite
of
the
rattle
of
the
and
the
gutteral
argument
of
two
germans
next
to
me
those
were
the
only
words
i
heard
her
say
on
that
journey
to
bonn
and
after
that
brand
talked
very
little
and
then
only
commonplace
remarks
about
the
time
and
the
scenery
but
what
i
had
heard
was
revealing
and
i
was
disturbed
for
sake
his
eyes
met
mine
as
i
passed
out
of
the
car
but
they
were
unseeing
eyes
he
stared
straight
through
me
to
some
vision
beyond
he
gave
his
hand
to
elsa
von
kreuzenach
and
they
walked
slowly
up
from
the
station
and
then
went
inside
the
cathedral
i
had
business
in
bonn
with
officers
at
our
headquarters
in
the
hotel
goldene
afterwards
i
had
lunch
with
them
and
then
with
one
went
to
house
a
little
shrine
in
which
the
spirit
of
the
master
still
lives
with
his
old
instruments
his
manuscript
sheets
of
music
and
many
relics
of
his
life
and
work
it
was
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
that
i
saw
brand
and
the
german
girl
again
there
was
a
beautiful
dusk
in
the
gardens
beyond
the
university
with
a
ruddy
glow
through
the
trees
when
the
sun
went
down
and
then
a
purple
twilight
some
german
boys
were
playing
leapfrog
there
watched
by
british
soldiers
and
townsfolk
passed
on
their
way
home
i
strolled
the
length
of
the
gardens
and
at
the
end
which
is
near
the
old
front
of
the
university
buildings
i
saw
brand
and
elsa
von
kreuzenach
together
on
a
wooden
seat
it
was
almost
dark
where
they
sat
under
the
trees
but
i
knew
brand
by
his
figure
and
by
the
tilt
of
his
and
the
girl
by
the
white
fur
round
her
neck
they
were
holding
hands
like
lovers
in
a
london
park
and
when
i
passed
them
i
heard
brand
speak
suppose
this
was
meant
to
be
fate
leads
us
when
i
went
back
to
cologne
by
tram
that
evening
i
wondered
whether
brand
would
confide
his
secret
to
me
we
had
been
so
much
together
during
the
last
phase
of
the
war
and
had
talked
so
much
in
intimate
friendship
that
i
guessed
he
would
come
one
day
and
let
me
know
this
new
adventure
of
his
soul
several
weeks
passed
and
he
said
no
word
of
this
we
went
for
walks
together
and
sat
smoking
sometimes
in
after
dinner
it
had
always
been
his
habit
to
drop
into
deep
silences
and
now
they
lasted
longer
than
before
now
and
then
however
he
would
be
talkative
argumentative
and
passionate
at
times
there
was
a
new
light
in
his
eyes
as
though
lit
by
some
inward
fire
and
he
would
smile
unconsciously
as
he
blew
out
clouds
of
smoke
but
more
often
he
looked
worried
nervous
and
irritable
as
though
passing
through
some
new
mental
crisis
he
spoke
a
good
deal
about
german
psychology
and
the
german
point
of
view
illustrating
his
remarks
sometimes
by
references
to
conversations
with
franz
von
kreuzenach
with
whom
he
often
talked
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
quite
hopeless
to
convince
even
the
germans
that
they
were
guilty
of
the
war
they
admitted
freely
enough
that
their
military
party
had
used
the
serbian
assassination
and
austrian
fury
as
the
fuel
for
starting
the
blaze
in
europe
even
then
they
believed
that
the
chancellor
and
the
civil
ministry
of
state
had
struggled
for
peace
until
the
russian
movements
of
troops
put
the
military
party
into
the
saddle
so
that
they
might
ride
to
hell
but
in
any
case
it
was
brand
said
an
unalterable
conviction
of
most
germans
that
sooner
or
later
the
war
had
been
bound
to
come
as
they
were
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
enemies
conspiring
to
thwart
their
free
development
and
to
overthrow
their
power
they
attacked
first
as
a
means
of
it
was
an
article
of
faith
with
them
that
they
had
fought
a
defensive
warfare
from
the
start
is
sheer
lunacy
i
said
brand
laughed
and
agreed
in
the
face
of
plain
facts
but
that
only
shows
how
strong
is
the
belief
of
people
in
their
own
righteousness
i
suppose
even
now
most
english
people
think
the
boer
war
was
just
and
holy
certainly
at
the
time
we
stoned
all
who
thought
otherwise
yet
the
verdict
of
the
whole
world
was
against
us
they
regarded
that
war
as
the
brutal
aggression
of
a
great
power
upon
a
small
and
heroic
surely
i
said
man
like
franz
von
admits
the
brutality
of
germany
in
belgium
the
shooting
of
priests
and
civilians
the
forced
labour
of
girls
the
smashing
of
machinery
and
all
the
rest
of
it
brand
said
that
franz
von
kreuzenach
deplored
the
of
german
acts
but
blamed
the
code
of
war
which
justified
such
acts
it
was
not
his
view
that
germans
had
behaved
with
exceptional
brutality
but
that
war
itself
is
a
brutal
way
of
argument
must
abolish
war
he
says
pretend
to
make
it
as
far
as
that
goes
i
agree
with
him
about
poison
gas
the
the
sinking
of
hospital
ships
submarine
warfare
brand
shrugged
his
shoulders
german
answer
is
always
the
same
war
is
war
and
they
were
hard
pressed
by
our
superiority
in
material
and
we
were
starving
them
to
death
with
our
blockade
they
saw
their
children
dying
and
diseased
their
old
people
carried
to
the
grave
their
men
weakened
they
had
to
break
through
somehow
anyhow
to
save
their
race
i
think
we
should
have
stopped
at
much
if
england
had
been
ringed
round
with
enemy
ships
and
the
kids
were
starving
in
mayfair
and
maida
vale
and
every
town
and
he
laughed
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
he
lit
his
pipe
for
about
the
fifteenth
time
is
no
good
he
said
argued
into
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
with
that
fellow
franz
von
kreuzenach
who
is
a
fine
fellow
and
the
whitest
man
met
in
germany
nothing
will
convince
him
that
his
people
were
more
guilty
than
ourselves
perhaps
right
history
will
decide
now
we
must
start
afresh
wipe
out
the
black
past
confess
that
though
the
germans
started
the
war
we
were
all
possessed
by
the
devil
and
exorcise
ourselves
i
believe
the
german
people
are
ready
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
start
a
fresh
chapter
of
history
if
we
will
help
them
and
give
them
a
chance
they
have
an
immense
hope
that
england
and
america
will
not
push
them
over
into
the
bottomless
abyss
now
that
they
have
fulfilled
demand
to
get
rid
of
their
old
rulers
and
fall
into
line
with
the
democracy
if
that
hope
fails
them
they
will
fall
back
to
the
old
philosophy
of
hatred
with
vengeance
as
its
goal
and
the
damned
thing
will
happen
again
in
fifteen
twenty
thirty
brand
made
one
remark
that
evening
which
referred
i
fancy
to
his
love
affair
with
elsa
von
kreuzenach
is
so
much
folly
in
the
crowd
that
one
despairs
of
reaching
a
higher
stage
of
civilisation
i
am
falling
back
on
individualism
the
individual
must
follow
his
own
ideals
strive
for
his
own
happiness
find
friendship
and
a
little
love
where
he
can
and
stand
apart
from
world
problems
racial
rivalries
international
prejudices
as
far
as
he
may
without
being
drawn
into
the
vortex
nothing
that
he
can
do
will
alter
human
destiny
or
the
forces
of
evolution
or
the
cycles
of
history
which
make
all
striving
futile
let
him
get
out
of
the
rain
and
comfort
himself
with
any
human
warmth
he
can
find
two
souls
in
contact
are
company
i
said
passion
tears
them
asunder
and
protests
against
their
union
with
stones
or
outlaw
judgment
taboo
will
exist
for
ever
in
human
society
and
it
is
devilish
unpleasant
for
individuals
who
violate
the
needs
courage
said
my
friend
risk
is
sometimes
worth
vii
brand
decided
to
take
the
risk
and
though
he
asked
my
advice
beforehand
as
a
matter
of
friendship
i
knew
my
warnings
were
useless
it
was
about
a
month
after
that
train
journey
to
bonn
that
he
came
into
my
room
at
the
domhof
looking
rather
pale
but
with
a
kind
of
glitter
in
his
eyes
may
as
well
tell
you
he
said
abruptly
i
am
going
to
marry
a
german
von
kreuzenach
how
did
you
know
a
against
her
wish
he
said
say
nothing
of
my
parents
who
think
i
have
gone
mad
elsa
and
i
will
have
to
play
a
lone
is
not
the
word
i
suggested
are
breaking
that
taboo
we
talked
of
you
will
be
shunned
by
every
friend
you
have
in
the
world
except
one
or
two
queer
people
like
here
he
said
and
grinned
rather
gratefully
both
you
and
she
will
be
pariahs
in
england
germany
and
anywhere
on
the
wide
earth
where
there
are
english
germans
french
americans
and
others
who
fought
the
war
i
suppose
you
know
that
he
answered
gravely
i
told
him
that
i
was
amazed
that
he
of
all
men
should
fall
in
love
with
a
german
girl
he
who
had
seen
all
the
abomination
of
the
war
and
had
come
out
to
it
with
a
flaming
idealism
to
that
he
answered
savagely
idealism
be
blowed
i
came
out
with
in
my
heart
and
having
killed
until
i
was
sick
of
killing
german
boys
who
popped
their
heads
over
the
parapet
i
saw
that
the
whole
scheme
of
things
was
wrong
and
that
the
grey
men
had
no
more
power
of
escape
than
the
brown
men
we
had
to
go
on
killing
each
other
because
we
were
both
under
the
same
law
thrust
upon
us
by
those
directing
the
infernal
machinery
of
but
not
the
point
and
old
and
stale
point
is
i
said
you
will
be
looked
upon
as
a
traitor
by
many
of
your
best
pals
that
you
will
smash
your
father
and
mother
and
that
this
girl
elsa
and
you
will
be
profoundly
shall
be
enormously
and
immensely
happy
he
answered
that
outweighs
he
told
me
that
he
needed
happiness
for
more
than
four
years
he
had
suffered
agony
of
mind
in
the
filth
and
mud
of
war
he
craved
for
beauty
and
elsa
fulfilled
his
ideal
he
had
been
a
lonely
devil
and
elsa
had
offered
him
the
only
cure
for
the
worst
disease
in
life
intimate
and
eternal
love
something
prompted
me
to
say
words
which
i
deeply
regretted
as
soon
as
they
were
spoken
it
was
the
utterance
of
a
subconscious
thought
is
a
girl
not
german
who
might
have
cured
your
loneliness
you
and
eileen
would
have
made
good
for
some
reason
he
was
hit
rather
hard
by
that
remark
he
became
exceedingly
pale
and
for
a
moment
or
two
did
not
answer
me
i
thought
he
would
blurt
out
some
angry
reply
damning
my
impudence
but
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
grave
gentle
way
which
seemed
to
me
more
puzzling
would
make
a
fine
wife
for
any
man
she
liked
but
above
most
of
we
stayed
up
talking
nearly
all
that
night
and
wickham
brand
described
one
scene
within
his
recent
experiences
which
must
have
been
sensational
it
was
when
he
announced
to
the
family
von
kreuzenach
that
he
loved
elsa
and
desired
her
hand
in
marriage
sense
of
humour
came
back
to
him
when
he
told
me
of
this
episode
and
he
laughed
now
at
the
frightfulness
of
his
ordeal
it
was
he
who
had
insisted
upon
announcing
the
news
to
parents
to
avoid
any
charge
of
dishonesty
elsa
herself
was
in
favour
of
hiding
their
love
until
peace
was
declared
when
perhaps
the
passionate
hostility
of
her
parents
to
england
might
be
abated
for
sake
also
she
thought
it
would
be
better
but
she
yielded
to
his
argument
that
secrecy
might
spoil
the
beauty
of
their
friendship
and
give
it
an
ugly
taint
go
through
with
it
straight
from
the
start
he
had
cried
answer
was
quick
and
glad
have
no
fear
now
of
anything
in
the
world
except
the
loss
of
you
franz
von
kreuzenach
was
the
first
to
know
and
elsa
told
him
he
seemed
stunned
with
surprise
and
then
immensely
glad
as
he
took
his
sister
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
marriage
with
an
english
officer
he
said
be
the
symbol
of
reconciliation
between
england
and
after
that
he
remembered
his
father
and
mother
and
was
a
coward
at
the
thought
of
their
hostility
the
idea
of
telling
his
father
as
elsa
asked
him
to
do
put
him
into
what
brand
called
bluest
of
blue
he
had
the
german
reverence
for
parental
authority
and
though
he
went
as
far
as
the
of
his
study
he
retreated
and
said
in
a
boyish
way
speaking
in
english
as
usual
with
brand
and
his
sister
the
pluck
i
would
rather
face
than
my
it
was
brand
who
over
the
he
made
his
announcement
formally
in
the
drawingroom
after
dinner
in
the
curiously
casual
way
which
proved
him
a
true
englishman
he
cleared
his
throat
he
told
me
grinning
at
his
own
mannerism
and
during
a
gap
in
the
conversation
said
to
the
general
the
way
sir
i
have
something
rather
special
to
mention
said
the
old
general
with
his
hard
deliberate
courtesy
daughter
and
i
said
brand
to
be
married
as
soon
as
possible
i
have
the
honour
to
ask
your
brand
told
me
of
the
awful
silence
which
followed
his
statement
it
seemed
interminable
franz
von
who
was
present
was
as
white
as
though
he
had
been
condemned
to
death
by
elsa
was
speechless
but
came
over
to
side
and
held
his
hand
her
mother
had
the
appearance
of
a
lady
startled
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
poisonous
snake
the
general
sat
back
in
his
chair
grasping
its
arms
and
gasping
for
breath
as
though
brand
had
hit
him
in
the
stomach
it
was
the
mother
who
spoke
first
and
ignoring
brand
completely
she
addressed
her
daughter
harshly
are
mad
elsa
mother
said
the
girl
am
mad
with
english
officer
insults
us
intolerably
said
the
mother
still
ignoring
brand
by
any
glance
were
forced
to
receive
him
into
our
house
at
least
he
might
have
behaved
with
decency
and
said
elsa
gentleman
has
given
me
the
great
honour
of
his
accept
it
said
the
lady
be
a
dishonour
so
dreadful
for
a
good
german
girl
that
i
refuse
to
believe
it
is
true
mother
and
i
am
wonderfully
elsa
went
over
to
her
mother
sinking
down
on
her
knees
and
kissing
the
hand
but
frau
von
withdrew
her
hand
quickly
and
then
rose
from
her
chair
and
stood
behind
her
husband
with
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
old
man
had
found
his
means
of
speech
at
last
he
spoke
in
a
low
stern
voice
to
his
daughter
brand
was
ignored
by
him
as
by
the
mother
they
did
not
recognise
his
presence
daughter
he
said
if
brand
remembered
his
words
german
people
have
been
brought
to
ruin
and
humiliated
by
one
nation
in
europe
who
was
jealous
of
our
power
and
genius
that
nation
was
england
our
treacherous
hypocritical
enemy
without
england
france
would
have
been
smashed
without
england
our
emperor
would
have
prevailed
over
all
his
enemies
without
the
english
blockade
we
should
not
have
been
weakened
by
hunger
deprived
of
the
raw
material
necessary
to
victory
starved
so
that
our
children
died
and
our
will
to
win
was
sapped
they
were
english
soldiers
who
killed
my
dear
son
heinrich
and
your
brother
the
flower
of
german
manhood
was
slain
by
the
english
in
flanders
and
on
the
the
general
spoke
very
quietly
with
an
intensity
of
effort
to
be
calm
but
suddenly
his
voice
rose
said
brand
to
a
kind
of
harsh
shout
german
girl
who
permits
herself
to
love
an
englishman
is
a
traitorous
hussy
i
would
have
her
stripped
and
flogged
the
curse
of
our
old
german
god
shall
follow
another
silence
in
which
there
was
no
sound
except
the
noisy
breathing
of
the
old
man
was
broken
by
the
hard
voice
of
frau
von
kreuzenach
father
has
spoken
elsa
there
is
no
more
to
elsa
had
become
very
pale
but
she
was
smiling
at
brand
he
told
me
and
still
held
his
hand
in
a
tight
grip
is
something
more
to
say
my
dear
father
and
mother
she
answered
is
that
i
love
captain
brand
and
that
i
will
follow
him
anywhere
in
the
world
if
he
will
take
me
for
love
is
stronger
than
hate
and
above
all
it
was
franz
von
kreuzenach
who
spoke
now
he
was
standing
at
the
table
facing
his
father
and
it
was
to
his
father
that
he
talked
he
said
that
elsa
was
right
about
love
in
spite
of
the
war
the
souls
of
men
and
women
were
not
separated
by
racial
boundaries
when
two
souls
touched
and
mingled
no
hatred
of
peoples
no
patriotic
passion
could
intervene
love
for
an
english
gentleman
was
but
a
symbol
of
the
peace
that
was
coming
when
all
countries
would
be
united
in
a
society
of
nations
with
equal
rights
and
equal
duties
and
a
common
brotherhood
they
saw
in
the
streets
of
cologne
that
there
was
no
natural
inevitable
hatred
between
english
and
germans
the
army
of
occupation
had
proved
itself
to
be
an
instrument
of
goodwill
between
those
who
had
tried
to
kill
each
other
during
four
years
of
slaughter
captain
brand
had
behaved
with
the
most
charming
courtesy
and
chivalry
according
to
the
traditions
of
an
english
gentleman
and
he
franz
von
kreuzenach
was
glad
and
honoured
because
this
officer
desired
to
take
elsa
for
his
wife
their
marriage
would
be
a
consecration
of
the
new
peace
the
father
listened
to
him
silently
except
for
that
hard
noise
of
breathing
when
his
son
uttered
those
last
words
the
old
man
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
his
eyes
glittered
out
of
my
house
do
not
come
near
me
again
or
i
will
denounce
you
as
a
traitor
and
shoot
you
like
a
he
turned
to
elsa
with
outstretched
hand
up
to
bed
girl
if
you
were
younger
i
would
flog
you
with
my
for
the
first
time
he
spoke
to
brand
controlling
his
rage
with
a
convulsive
effort
have
not
the
power
to
evict
you
from
the
house
for
the
time
being
the
german
people
of
the
rhineland
are
under
hostile
orders
perhaps
you
will
find
another
billet
more
to
your
convenience
and
more
agreeable
to
sir
said
brand
and
he
told
me
that
he
admired
the
old
and
his
studied
dignity
elsa
still
clasped
his
hand
and
before
her
family
he
kissed
her
your
leave
or
without
leave
he
said
daughter
and
i
will
be
man
and
wife
for
you
have
no
right
to
stand
between
our
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
and
in
an
hour
the
house
franz
von
kreuzenach
came
into
his
room
before
he
left
and
wrung
his
hand
must
go
too
he
said
father
is
very
much
enraged
with
me
it
is
the
break
between
the
young
and
the
old
the
new
conflict
as
we
were
saying
one
he
was
near
weeping
and
brand
apologised
for
being
the
cause
of
so
much
trouble
in
the
hall
elsa
came
to
brand
as
the
orderly
carried
out
his
bags
she
said
will
meet
at
elizabeth
von
my
true
her
eyes
were
wet
with
tears
but
she
was
smiling
and
there
was
said
brand
a
fine
courage
shining
in
her
face
she
put
her
hands
on
shoulders
and
kissed
him
to
the
deep
astonishment
and
embarrassment
of
the
orderly
who
stood
by
it
was
from
this
man
brock
that
the
news
of
spread
through
other
orderlies
to
officers
of
his
mess
as
he
knew
by
the
cold
shoulder
that
some
of
them
turned
to
him
viii
i
met
elsa
and
franz
von
kreuzenach
at
the
house
of
elizabeth
von
detmold
in
the
hohenzollernring
which
became
a
for
brand
and
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
now
betrothed
small
and
i
went
round
there
to
tea
at
invitation
and
i
spent
several
evenings
there
owing
to
the
friendship
of
elizabeth
von
detmold
who
seemed
to
like
my
company
that
lady
was
in
many
ways
remarkable
and
i
am
bound
to
say
that
in
spite
of
my
repugnance
to
many
qualities
of
the
german
character
i
found
her
charming
the
tragedy
of
the
war
had
hit
her
with
an
almost
particular
malignancy
married
in
to
a
young
officer
of
the
prussian
guard
she
was
widowed
at
the
first
battle
of
ypres
her
three
brothers
had
been
killed
in
and
both
her
parents
had
died
during
the
war
owing
to
its
accumulating
horror
at
years
of
age
she
was
left
alone
in
her
big
house
with
hardly
enough
money
for
its
upkeep
and
not
enough
to
supplement
the
rigid
war
rations
which
were
barely
sufficient
for
life
i
suppose
there
were
thousands
of
young
women
in
germany
hundreds
of
thousands
who
had
the
same
cause
for
sorrow
we
do
not
realise
how
german
families
were
massacred
in
that
of
war
so
that
even
french
and
british
losses
pale
in
tragedy
before
their
piled
dead
but
there
were
few
i
am
sure
who
faced
their
grief
with
such
high
courage
and
such
unembittered
charity
like
elsa
von
kreuzenach
she
devoted
her
days
to
suffering
childhood
in
the
and
which
she
had
helped
to
organise
and
she
spent
many
of
her
evenings
in
clubs
and
sometimes
in
clubs
where
she
read
and
lectured
to
them
on
social
problems
the
war
had
made
her
an
ardent
pacifist
and
to
some
extent
a
revolutionary
of
the
liebknecht
school
she
saw
no
hope
for
civilisation
so
long
as
the
junker
caste
remained
in
europe
and
the
philosophy
of
militarism
which
she
believed
stood
fast
not
only
in
germany
but
in
france
and
england
and
other
nations
she
had
a
passionate
belief
like
many
other
german
people
at
that
time
in
president
wilson
and
his
league
of
nations
and
put
all
her
hopes
in
the
united
states
as
the
one
power
in
the
world
who
could
make
a
peace
of
reconciliation
and
establish
a
new
brotherhood
of
peoples
after
that
she
looked
to
a
social
revolution
throughout
the
world
by
which
the
working
classes
should
obtain
full
control
of
their
own
destiny
and
labour
i
found
it
strange
to
hear
that
patrician
girl
for
she
was
one
of
the
aristocratic
caste
with
an
elegance
that
came
from
long
breeding
adopting
the
extreme
views
of
revolutionary
socialism
not
as
a
pretty
intellectual
theory
but
with
a
pasisonate
courage
that
might
lead
her
to
prison
or
to
death
in
the
conflict
between
the
old
powers
and
the
new
to
elsa
von
kreuzenach
she
behaved
in
a
protective
and
mothering
way
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
girl
as
small
called
her
was
the
spiritual
child
of
this
stronger
and
more
vital
character
elsa
was
i
fancy
timid
of
those
political
and
pacifist
ideas
which
elizabeth
von
detmold
stated
with
such
frank
audacity
she
cherished
the
spirit
of
the
human
charity
which
gave
them
their
motive
power
but
shrank
from
the
thought
of
the
social
strife
and
change
which
must
precede
them
yet
there
was
nothing
in
her
character
there
were
moments
when
i
saw
her
face
illumined
by
a
kind
of
mediaeval
mysticism
which
was
the
light
of
a
spirit
revealed
perhaps
by
the
physical
casket
which
held
it
insecurely
truly
she
was
as
pretty
and
delicate
as
a
piece
of
dresden
china
but
for
sake
i
did
not
like
the
fragile
look
which
hinted
at
a
quick
fading
of
her
beauty
her
adoration
for
brand
was
in
my
opinion
rather
pitiful
it
was
very
german
too
in
its
meek
reverence
as
of
a
mediaeval
maid
to
knighthood
i
prefer
the
way
of
french
womanhood
convinced
of
intellectual
equality
with
men
and
with
their
abiding
sense
of
humour
or
the
arrogance
of
the
english
girl
who
makes
her
lover
prove
his
mettle
by
quiet
obedience
elsa
followed
brand
with
her
eyes
wherever
he
moved
touched
his
hard
tanned
hand
with
little
secret
caresses
and
whenever
he
spoke
her
eyes
shone
with
gladness
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
i
liked
her
better
when
she
was
talking
to
our
little
doctor
or
to
myself
and
therefore
not
absorbed
in
sentiment
at
these
times
she
was
frank
and
vivacious
and
indeed
had
an
english
way
with
her
which
no
doubt
she
had
learnt
in
her
brighton
school
brand
interested
me
intensely
at
these
times
sometimes
i
found
myself
doubting
whether
he
was
really
so
much
in
love
with
his
german
girl
as
he
imagined
himself
to
be
i
noticed
that
he
was
embarrassed
by
public
demonstrations
of
love
that
way
she
had
of
touching
his
hand
and
another
trick
of
leaning
her
head
against
his
shoulder
as
a
typical
englishman
in
some
parts
of
his
brain
at
least
he
shrank
from
exposing
his
affection
it
seemed
to
me
also
that
he
was
more
interested
in
political
and
psychological
problems
than
in
the
of
glances
and
revealings
he
argued
long
and
deeply
with
elizabeth
von
detmold
on
the
philosophy
of
karl
marx
the
anarchist
movement
in
berlin
and
on
the
possibility
of
a
rhineland
republic
which
was
then
being
advocated
by
a
party
in
cologne
and
mainz
whose
watchword
was
von
berlin
and
freedom
from
prussian
domination
for
the
rhine
provinces
even
with
elsa
he
led
the
conversation
to
discussions
about
german
mentality
the
system
of
german
education
and
the
possible
terms
of
peace
twice
at
least
when
i
was
present
he
differed
with
her
rather
bluntly
a
little
brutally
i
thought
about
the
german
administration
of
belgium
people
did
no
more
than
was
allowed
by
the
necessities
of
war
said
elsa
was
stern
and
tragic
but
not
more
barbarous
than
what
other
nations
would
have
was
horrible
bloody
and
unjustified
said
brand
war
said
elizabeth
von
detmold
bloody
and
unjustified
directly
war
is
declared
the
moral
law
is
abrogated
it
is
simply
the
reign
of
devildom
why
pretend
otherwise
or
weaken
the
devilish
logic
by
a
few
inconsistencies
of
sentiment
answer
to
elsa
was
not
exactly
i
saw
the
colour
fade
from
her
face
at
the
harshness
of
his
answer
but
she
leaned
her
head
against
his
body
she
was
sitting
by
his
side
on
a
low
stool
and
was
silent
until
her
friend
elizabeth
had
spoken
then
she
laughed
bravely
i
thought
differ
in
expression
but
we
all
agree
what
wickham
thinks
is
my
thought
i
hate
to
remember
how
belgium
brand
was
utterly
unconscious
of
his
harsh
way
of
speech
and
of
his
unconcealed
acknowledgment
of
elizabeth
von
intellectual
superiority
in
her
own
so
that
when
she
spoke
his
interest
was
directed
from
elsa
to
this
lady
small
was
also
immensely
impressed
by
frau
von
character
and
he
confessed
to
me
that
he
made
notes
of
her
conversation
every
time
he
left
her
house
woman
he
said
probably
be
a
martyr
for
civilisation
i
find
myself
so
cussedly
in
agreement
with
her
that
when
i
go
back
to
new
york
i
shall
probably
hang
a
red
flag
out
of
my
window
and
lose
all
my
respectable
patients
she
has
the
vision
of
the
about
brand
and
elsa
i
asked
dragging
him
down
to
personalities
he
put
his
arm
through
mine
as
we
walked
down
the
hohestrasse
he
said
in
his
shrewd
way
combining
martyrdom
with
romance
an
unsafe
combination
the
pretty
elsa
has
lighted
up
his
romantic
heart
because
of
her
adoration
and
her
feminine
sentiment
i
blame
him
at
his
age
after
four
years
of
war
and
exile
her
hair
would
have
woven
a
web
round
my
heart
youth
is
youth
and
you
forget
it
my
lad
does
the
martyrdom
come
in
i
asked
the
little
doctor
blinked
through
his
horn
spectacles
you
see
it
brand
has
been
working
out
new
ideals
of
life
after
killing
a
good
many
german
boys
as
sniper
and
chief
assassin
of
the
xi
corps
he
wants
to
marry
a
german
girl
as
a
proclamation
to
the
world
that
he
wickham
brand
has
done
with
hatred
and
is
out
for
the
brotherhood
of
man
and
the
breaking
down
of
the
old
frontiers
for
that
ideal
he
is
going
to
sacrifice
his
reputation
and
make
a
martyr
of
himself
not
forgetting
that
romance
is
pleasant
and
elsa
von
kreuzenach
as
pretty
as
a
peach
bless
his
heart
i
admire
his
courage
and
his
any
doubt
i
had
about
the
reality
of
passion
for
elsa
was
at
least
partly
dispelled
when
he
told
me
a
few
nights
later
of
a
tragic
thing
that
had
happened
to
both
of
them
he
came
into
my
room
at
the
as
though
he
had
just
seen
a
ghost
and
indeed
it
was
a
ghost
that
had
frightened
him
and
put
a
cold
hand
between
him
and
elsa
dear
old
man
i
cried
at
the
sight
of
him
on
earth
has
happened
damnable
and
inconceivable
thing
i
poured
him
out
some
brandy
and
he
drank
it
in
gulps
then
he
did
a
strange
and
startling
thing
fumbling
in
his
he
pulled
out
a
silver
and
going
over
to
the
fireplace
dropped
it
into
the
blaze
of
the
wood
logs
which
i
had
had
lighted
because
of
the
dampness
of
the
room
do
you
do
that
i
asked
he
watched
the
metal
box
blacken
and
then
begin
to
melt
several
times
he
poked
it
so
as
to
get
it
deeper
into
the
red
embers
poor
little
elsa
he
said
in
a
pitiful
way
hussches
madel
the
story
he
told
me
later
was
astounding
even
now
to
people
who
were
not
in
the
war
who
do
not
know
how
many
strange
fantastic
things
happened
in
that
wild
nightmare
it
will
seem
improbable
and
untrue
indeed
i
think
the
central
fact
was
untrue
except
as
a
subjective
reality
in
the
minds
of
brand
and
elsa
it
happened
when
they
were
sitting
alone
in
elizabeth
von
i
fancy
they
must
have
been
embracing
each
other
though
brand
did
not
tell
me
that
anyhow
elsa
put
her
hand
into
his
and
in
a
playful
way
pulled
out
his
i
open
it
she
asked
but
she
did
not
open
it
she
stared
at
a
little
monogram
on
its
cover
and
then
began
to
tremble
so
that
brand
was
scared
is
the
matter
he
said
elsa
let
the
drop
on
to
the
carpet
box
she
said
in
an
agonised
voice
did
you
find
it
brand
remembered
where
he
had
found
it
though
he
had
not
given
a
thought
to
it
for
more
than
two
years
he
had
found
it
on
a
night
in
no
land
out
by
the
bois
français
near
fricourt
he
had
been
lying
out
there
on
the
lip
of
a
mine
crater
below
a
hummock
of
white
chalk
just
before
dawn
a
german
patrol
had
crept
out
and
he
had
shot
at
them
one
man
dropped
quite
close
to
where
brand
lay
after
an
hour
when
dawn
came
with
a
thick
white
mist
rising
from
the
moist
earth
brand
crawled
over
to
the
body
and
cut
off
its
for
identification
it
was
the
body
of
a
young
man
almost
a
boy
and
brand
saw
with
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
it
was
his
time
that
he
had
shot
him
clean
through
the
heart
a
good
shot
in
the
twilight
of
the
dawn
he
thrust
his
hands
into
the
pockets
for
papers
and
found
his
and
some
letters
and
a
with
these
he
crawled
back
into
his
own
trench
he
remembered
reading
the
letters
one
was
from
the
sister
lamenting
the
length
of
the
war
describing
the
growing
hunger
of
civilians
in
germany
and
saying
how
she
prayed
every
night
for
her
safety
and
for
peace
he
had
read
thousands
of
german
letters
as
an
intelligence
officer
afterwards
but
he
remembered
those
because
of
the
adventure
he
had
handed
them
over
to
the
adjutant
for
headquarters
and
had
kept
the
having
lost
his
own
it
had
the
monogram
of
he
had
never
thought
about
it
from
that
time
to
this
now
he
thought
about
it
with
an
intensity
of
remembrance
brand
told
elsa
von
kreuzenach
that
he
had
found
the
box
in
no
land
is
my
brother
she
cried
gave
it
to
she
drew
back
shivering
from
the
or
was
it
from
brand
when
she
spoke
next
it
was
in
a
whisper
you
kill
him
brand
lied
to
her
and
she
knew
he
was
lying
she
wept
bitterly
and
when
brand
kissed
her
she
was
cold
and
fainted
in
his
arms
that
was
story
and
it
was
incredible
even
now
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
such
a
coincidence
could
not
have
happened
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
doubt
about
that
it
was
of
a
usual
pattern
plain
with
a
wreath
engraved
round
a
monogram
that
monogram
was
astonishing
in
relation
to
elsa
von
kreuzenach
but
there
are
thousands
of
germans
i
imagine
with
the
same
initials
i
know
two
hermann
von
kranitz
and
hans
von
kurtheim
in
a
german
directory
i
have
found
many
other
names
with
those
initials
i
refuse
to
believe
that
brand
should
have
gone
straight
to
the
house
of
that
boy
whom
he
had
killed
in
no
land
he
believed
it
and
elsa
was
sure
of
it
that
was
the
tragedy
and
the
ghost
of
the
dead
brother
stood
between
them
now
for
an
hour
or
more
he
paced
up
and
down
my
room
in
an
agony
of
mind
and
none
of
my
arguments
would
convince
him
or
comfort
him
several
times
he
spoke
one
sentence
which
puzzled
me
makes
no
difference
he
said
makes
no
i
think
he
meant
that
it
made
no
difference
to
his
love
or
purpose
when
one
thinks
over
this
incident
one
is
inclined
to
agree
with
that
view
he
was
no
more
guilty
in
killing
brother
if
he
did
than
in
killing
any
other
german
if
their
love
were
strong
enough
to
cross
over
fields
of
dead
the
fact
that
brother
lay
there
shot
by
bullet
made
as
he
said
it
only
brought
home
more
closely
to
two
poor
individuals
the
meaning
of
that
elsa
after
her
first
shock
of
horror
argued
that
too
and
at
the
beginning
of
march
brand
and
she
stood
at
the
altar
together
in
a
church
at
the
end
of
the
hohenzollem
ring
and
were
made
man
and
wife
at
the
ceremony
there
were
present
elizabeth
von
detmold
franz
von
kreuzenach
small
and
myself
as
best
man
there
was
i
think
another
presence
there
visible
only
to
the
minds
of
brand
and
elsa
and
strangely
enough
to
mine
as
the
bride
and
bridegroom
stood
together
before
the
priest
i
had
a
most
uncomfortable
vision
of
the
dead
body
of
a
german
boy
lying
on
the
altar
beyond
them
huddled
up
as
i
had
seen
many
grey
figures
in
the
mud
of
flanders
and
picardy
this
idea
was
of
course
due
to
that
which
as
small
said
was
the
malady
of
the
world
i
think
at
one
moment
of
the
service
elsa
and
brand
felt
some
cold
touch
upon
them
for
they
both
looked
round
in
a
startled
way
it
may
have
been
a
draught
stealing
through
the
aisle
we
had
tea
at
elizabeth
von
house
and
brand
and
his
wife
were
wonderfully
they
could
not
be
happy
beyond
the
sense
of
a
spiritual
union
because
brand
had
been
ordered
by
telegram
to
report
at
the
war
office
in
london
and
was
leaving
cologne
at
four
that
afternoon
while
elsa
was
going
home
to
her
parents
who
were
ignorant
of
her
marriage
recall
i
am
convinced
had
been
engineered
by
his
father
who
was
determined
to
take
any
step
to
prevent
his
marriage
with
a
german
girl
young
harding
was
going
with
him
having
been
given
his
demobilisation
papers
and
being
desperately
anxious
as
i
have
told
to
get
home
it
was
curious
that
brand
should
be
his
that
night
and
i
thought
of
the
contrast
of
their
journey
one
man
going
to
his
wife
with
eager
gladness
the
other
man
leaving
his
wife
after
a
few
hours
of
marriage
at
the
end
poor
elsa
clung
to
her
husband
with
most
passionate
grief
and
without
any
now
because
of
the
depth
of
his
emotion
brand
with
tears
in
his
eyes
tenderly
embraced
her
she
walked
back
bravely
with
her
brother
to
her
house
while
brand
and
i
raced
to
the
station
where
his
orderly
was
waiting
with
his
kit
you
again
soon
said
brand
gripping
my
hand
i
asked
and
he
answered
gloomily
it
was
not
on
the
rhine
there
was
a
general
exodus
of
all
officers
who
could
get
on
any
claim
or
pretext
the
small
army
of
occupation
settled
down
to
a
routine
life
without
adventure
and
the
interest
shifted
to
paris
where
the
fate
of
europe
was
being
settled
by
a
company
of
men
with
the
greatest
chance
in
history
i
became
a
wanderer
in
a
sick
world
end

builders
of
peace
i
those
of
us
who
had
been
in
exile
during
the
years
of
war
and
now
returned
to
peace
found
that
england
had
changed
in
our
absence
we
did
not
know
this
new
england
we
did
not
understand
its
spirit
or
its
people
nor
did
they
understand
the
men
who
came
back
from
the
many
fronts
of
war
by
hundreds
of
thousands
now
that
demobilisation
had
become
a
spate
after
murmurings
that
were
loud
with
the
menace
of
revolt
from
men
who
had
been
long
patient
these
the
men
who
came
back
out
of
the
terror
were
so
many
rip
van
winkles
of
a
youthful
kind
looking
round
for
the
companions
of
their
boyhood
going
to
old
places
touching
old
stones
sitting
by
the
same
fireside
but
with
a
sense
of
ghostliness
a
new
generation
had
arrived
since
the
children
had
become
boys
and
girls
the
girls
had
grown
into
womanhood
precociously
there
were
legions
of
in
london
and
other
big
cities
earning
good
wages
in
government
offices
and
factories
spending
most
of
their
money
on
the
adornment
of
their
prettiness
audacious
out
for
the
fun
of
life
and
finding
it
the
tragedy
of
the
war
had
not
touched
them
it
had
been
a
great
to
them
they
accepted
the
slaughter
of
their
brothers
or
their
fathers
after
a
few
bursts
of
tears
and
a
period
of
sentiment
in
which
pride
was
strongest
they
had
grown
up
to
the
belief
that
a
soldier
is
generally
killed
or
wounded
and
that
he
is
glad
to
take
the
risk
or
if
not
ought
to
be
as
part
of
the
most
exciting
and
enjoyable
game
of
war
women
had
filled
many
of
the
jobs
which
formerly
were
the
exclusive
possession
of
men
and
the
men
coming
back
looked
at
these
legions
of
women
clerks
tram
conductors
ticket
collectors
munition
workers
and
motor
drivers
with
the
brooding
thought
that
they
the
men
had
been
ousted
from
their
places
a
new
class
had
arisen
out
of
the
whirlpool
of
social
upheaval
the
profiteers
in
a
large
way
of
business
had
prospered
exceedingly
out
of
the
supply
and
demand
of
massacre
the
wife
clothed
herself
in
furs
and
jewels
the
daughters
were
dancing
by
night
and
sleeping
by
day
the
farmers
and
the
shopkeepers
had
made
a
good
thing
out
of
war
they
liked
war
so
long
as
they
were
untouched
by
or
not
afflicted
by
boys
who
came
back
blind
or
crippled
they
had
always
been
optimists
they
were
optimists
now
and
claimed
a
share
in
the
merit
of
the
victory
that
had
been
won
by
the
glorious
watchword
of
as
they
hoped
the
terms
of
peace
would
be
merciless
upon
the
enemy
and
they
demanded
the
head
as
a
pleasant
sacrifice
adding
spice
to
the
great
banquet
of
victory
celebrations
outwardly
england
was
gay
and
prosperous
and
it
was
only
by
getting
away
from
the
seething
crowds
in
the
streets
from
the
dancing
crowds
and
the
theatre
crowds
and
the
shopping
crowds
that
men
came
face
to
face
with
private
and
hidden
tragedy
in
small
houses
or
big
there
were
women
who
had
lost
their
men
and
were
listless
and
joyless
the
mothers
of
only
sons
who
did
not
come
back
with
the
demobilised
tide
and
the
sweethearts
of
boys
who
would
never
fulfil
the
promise
that
had
given
hope
in
life
to
lonely
girlhood
there
was
a
new
rich
but
there
was
also
a
new
poor
and
people
on
small
fixed
incomes
or
with
little
of
capital
on
which
they
scraped
out
life
found
themselves
reduced
to
desperate
straits
by
the
soaring
of
prices
and
the
burden
of
taxation
underneath
the
surface
joy
of
a
victorious
people
there
was
bitterness
to
which
victory
was
a
mockery
and
a
haggard
grief
at
the
cost
of
war
in
precious
blood
but
the
bitterness
smouldered
without
any
flame
of
passion
and
grief
nagged
at
hearts
silently
many
of
the
men
who
came
back
were
in
a
strange
mood
restless
morbid
neurotic
their
own
people
did
not
understand
them
they
could
not
understand
themselves
they
had
hated
war
most
of
them
but
this
peace
seemed
flat
and
unprofitable
to
their
souls
all
purpose
and
meaning
seemed
suddenly
to
have
gone
out
of
life
perhaps
it
was
the
narrowness
of
english
men
who
had
travelled
to
far
places
of
the
world
who
had
seen
the
ways
of
foreign
people
and
had
been
part
of
a
great
drama
found
themselves
back
again
in
a
little
house
closed
in
and
isolated
by
the
traditions
of
english
individualism
so
that
often
the
neighbour
is
a
stranger
they
had
a
sense
of
being
suffocated
they
could
not
stay
indoors
with
the
old
pleasure
in
a
pipe
or
a
book
by
the
fireside
or
a
chat
with
mother
or
wife
often
they
would
wander
out
on
the
chance
of
meeting
some
of
the
pals
or
after
a
heavy
sigh
say
god
go
to
a
theatre
or
a
show
the
theatres
were
crammed
with
men
seeking
distraction
yet
bored
with
their
pleasures
and
relapsing
into
a
deeper
moodiness
afterwards
wives
complained
that
their
husbands
had
their
characters
had
hardened
and
their
tempers
were
frayed
so
that
they
were
strangely
irritable
and
given
to
storms
of
rage
about
nothing
at
all
it
was
frightening
there
was
an
epidemic
of
violence
and
of
horrible
sensual
crimes
with
women
victims
ending
often
in
suicide
there
were
mob
riots
by
demobilised
soldiers
or
soldiers
still
waiting
in
camps
for
demobilisation
police
stations
were
stormed
and
wrecked
and
policemen
killed
by
bodies
of
men
who
had
been
heroes
in
the
war
and
now
fought
like
savages
against
their
some
of
them
pleaded
guilty
in
court
and
made
queer
statements
about
an
utter
ignorance
of
their
own
actions
after
the
disorder
had
begun
it
seemed
as
though
they
had
returned
to
the
psychology
of
that
war
when
men
doped
with
rum
or
drunk
with
excitement
had
leapt
over
the
parapet
and
remembered
nothing
more
of
a
battle
until
they
found
themselves
panting
in
an
enemy
trench
or
lying
wounded
on
a
stretcher
it
was
a
dangerous
kind
of
psychology
in
civil
life
labourers
back
at
work
in
factories
or
mines
or
railway
stations
or
dockyards
after
months
or
years
of
the
did
not
return
to
their
old
conditions
or
their
old
pay
with
diligence
and
thankfulness
they
demanded
higher
wages
to
meet
the
higher
cost
of
life
and
after
that
a
margin
for
pleasure
and
after
that
shorter
hours
for
higher
pay
and
less
work
in
shorter
hours
if
their
demands
were
not
granted
they
downed
tools
and
said
about
it
strikes
became
frequent
and
general
and
at
a
time
when
the
cost
of
war
was
being
added
up
to
frightful
totals
of
debt
which
could
only
be
reduced
by
immense
production
the
worker
slacked
off
or
suspended
his
labours
and
said
gets
the
profits
of
my
sweat
i
want
a
larger
he
was
not
frightened
of
a
spectre
that
was
scaring
all
people
of
property
and
morality
in
the
western
world
the
spectre
of
bolshevism
dripping
with
blood
proclaiming
anarchy
as
the
new
gospel
did
not
cause
a
shiver
to
the
english
working
man
he
said
has
russia
to
do
with
me
english
i
have
fought
this
war
to
save
england
i
have
done
the
job
now
then
my
reward
men
who
looked
round
for
a
living
while
they
lived
on
an
unemployment
dole
that
was
not
good
enough
for
their
new
desires
became
sullen
when
they
returned
home
night
after
night
with
the
same
old
story
of
the
women
were
still
clinging
to
their
jobs
they
had
earned
their
independence
by
good
work
in
they
hated
the
thought
of
going
back
to
little
homes
to
be
household
drudges
dependent
for
on
father
and
brothers
they
had
not
only
tasted
liberty
they
had
made
themselves
free
of
the
large
world
they
had
proved
their
quality
and
strength
they
were
as
good
as
men
and
mostly
better
why
should
they
slink
back
to
the
little
narrow
rut
of
life
but
the
men
said
out
give
us
back
our
it
was
hard
on
the
officer
boys
hardest
of
all
on
them
they
had
gone
straight
from
school
to
the
war
and
had
commanded
men
twice
as
old
as
themselves
and
drawn
good
pay
for
as
first
lieutenants
captains
even
majors
of
air
squadrons
and
tank
battalions
they
had
gained
immense
experience
in
the
arts
and
crafts
of
war
and
that
experience
was
utterly
useless
in
peace
dear
young
man
said
the
heads
of
prosperous
businesses
who
had
been
out
to
the
boche
even
though
they
sacrificed
their
only
sons
or
all
their
sons
with
heroic
courage
have
been
wasting
your
time
you
have
no
qualifications
whatever
for
a
junior
clerkship
in
this
office
on
the
contrary
you
have
probably
contracted
habits
of
idleness
and
inaccuracy
which
would
cause
a
lot
of
trouble
this
vacancy
is
being
filled
by
a
lad
who
has
not
been
vitiated
by
military
life
and
has
nothing
to
unlearn
and
the
young
officers
after
a
statement
like
that
went
home
with
learnt
in
flanders
and
said
the
reward
of
patriotism
eh
well
we
seem
to
have
been
fooled
pretty
badly
next
time
we
be
so
keen
to
strew
the
fields
of
death
with
our
fresh
little
these
words
all
this
murmur
from
below
did
not
reach
those
who
sat
in
high
places
they
were
wonderfully
complacent
except
when
outbreaks
of
violence
or
the
cessation
of
labour
shocked
them
with
a
sense
of
danger
they
arranged
peace
celebrations
before
the
peace
victory
marches
when
the
fruits
of
victory
were
as
bitter
as
dead
sea
fruit
in
the
mouths
of
those
who
saw
the
ruin
of
the
world
and
round
a
council
table
in
paris
statesmen
of
europe
abandoned
all
the
ideals
for
which
the
war
had
been
fought
by
humble
men
and
killed
the
hopes
of
all
those
who
had
looked
to
them
as
the
founders
of
a
new
era
of
humanity
and
common
sense
ii
it
was
when
the
peace
treaty
had
been
signed
but
not
ratified
by
the
representatives
of
germany
and
austria
that
i
met
some
of
the
friends
with
whom
i
had
travelled
along
many
roads
of
war
or
had
met
in
scenes
which
already
seemed
far
back
in
history
in
london
after
a
journey
to
america
i
came
again
in
touch
with
young
harding
whom
i
had
seen
last
on
his
way
home
to
his
pretty
wife
who
had
fretted
at
his
long
absence
and
charles
fortune
whose
sense
of
humour
had
made
me
laugh
so
often
in
the
time
of
tragedy
those
were
chance
meetings
in
the
eddies
of
the
great
whirlpool
of
london
life
as
i
saw
other
faces
strange
for
a
moment
or
two
until
the
difference
between
a
and
a
bowler
hat
a
uniform
and
civil
clothes
was
wiped
out
by
a
look
of
recognition
and
the
sound
of
a
remembered
voice
not
by
chance
but
by
a
friendship
which
had
followed
me
across
the
world
with
written
words
i
found
myself
once
more
in
the
company
of
wickham
brand
and
with
him
went
again
to
spend
some
evenings
with
eileen
who
was
now
home
in
kensington
after
that
grim
drama
which
she
had
played
so
long
in
lille
with
small
i
had
been
linked
up
by
a
lucky
chain
of
coincidences
which
had
taken
us
both
to
new
york
at
the
same
time
and
brought
us
back
to
europe
on
the
same
boat
which
was
the
white
star
liner
my
chance
meeting
with
harding
led
to
a
renewal
of
friendship
which
was
more
of
his
seeking
than
mine
though
i
liked
him
a
good
deal
but
he
seemed
to
need
me
craving
sympathy
which
i
gave
with
sincerity
and
companionship
which
i
could
not
give
so
easily
being
a
busy
man
it
was
on
the
night
when
london
went
mad
because
of
peace
though
not
so
mad
i
was
told
as
on
the
night
of
armistice
it
all
seemed
mad
to
me
when
i
was
carried
like
a
straw
in
a
raging
torrent
of
life
which
poured
down
the
strand
swirled
round
trafalgar
square
and
choked
all
channels
westwards
and
eastwards
of
piccadilly
circus
the
spirit
of
london
had
broken
bounds
it
came
wildly
from
mean
streets
in
the
slum
quarters
to
the
heart
of
the
west
end
the
worst
elements
had
surged
up
and
mingled
with
the
folk
and
those
who
claim
exclusiveness
by
the
power
of
wealth
in
ignorance
that
all
barriers
of
caste
were
to
be
broken
that
night
women
as
they
are
called
rather
insolent
in
their
public
display
of
white
shoulders
and
diamonds
and
furs
set
out
in
motor
cars
for
hotels
and
restaurants
which
had
arranged
peace
dinners
and
peace
dances
some
of
them
i
saw
were
unaccompanied
by
their
own
men
whom
they
were
to
meet
later
but
the
vacant
seats
in
their
open
cars
were
quickly
filled
by
soldiers
seamen
or
merry
devils
in
civil
clothes
who
climbed
over
the
backs
of
the
cars
when
they
were
brought
to
a
standstill
in
the
crush
of
vast
crowds
those
uninvited
guests
some
of
them
wearing
bonnets
most
of
them
fluttering
with
flags
pinned
to
their
coats
all
of
them
provided
with
noisemaking
instruments
behaved
with
ironical
humour
to
the
pretty
ladies
touched
their
coiled
hair
with
blew
loud
blasts
on
their
toy
trumpets
delivered
cockney
orations
to
them
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
crowds
below
some
of
the
pretty
ladies
accepted
the
situation
with
courage
and
good
humour
laughing
with
shrill
mirth
at
their
grotesque
companions
others
were
frightened
and
angry
i
saw
one
girl
try
to
beat
off
the
hands
of
men
clambering
about
her
car
they
swarmed
into
it
and
paid
no
heed
to
her
cries
of
protest
all
the
flappers
were
out
in
the
strand
and
in
trafalgar
square
and
many
streets
they
were
factory
girls
shop
girls
office
girls
and
their
eyes
were
alight
with
adventure
and
a
pagan
ecstasy
men
teased
them
as
they
passed
with
the
long
and
they
armed
with
the
same
weapon
fought
duels
with
these
aggressors
and
then
fled
and
were
pursued
into
the
darkness
of
where
they
were
caught
and
kissed
soldiers
in
uniform
english
scots
canadians
australians
came
lurching
along
in
gangs
arm
in
arm
then
mingled
with
the
girls
changed
headgear
with
them
struggled
and
danced
and
stampeded
with
them
seamen
three
sheets
in
the
wind
steered
an
uneven
course
through
this
turbulent
sea
of
life
roaring
out
choruses
until
each
man
had
found
a
maid
for
the
dance
of
joy
london
was
a
dark
forest
with
nymphs
and
satyrs
at
play
in
the
glades
and
pan
stamping
his
hoofs
like
a
giddy
goat
all
the
passions
let
loose
by
war
the
breaking
down
of
old
restraints
the
gladness
of
youth
at
escape
from
death
provided
the
unconscious
and
primitive
behind
this
carnival
of
the
london
crowds
from
some
church
a
procession
came
into
trafalgar
square
trying
to
make
a
pathway
through
the
multitude
a
golden
cross
was
raised
high
and
clergymen
in
surplices
with
acolytes
and
faithful
women
came
chanting
solemn
words
the
crowd
closed
about
them
a
mirthful
sailor
teased
the
singing
women
with
his
loud
guffaws
shrill
laughter
were
in
the
wake
of
the
procession
though
some
men
stood
to
attention
as
the
cross
passed
and
others
bared
their
heads
and
something
hushed
the
pagan
riot
a
moment
at
the
windows
in
pall
mall
men
in
evening
clothes
who
had
been
officers
in
the
sat
by
the
pretty
women
who
had
driven
through
the
crowds
looking
out
on
the
noisy
pageant
of
the
street
a
was
playing
and
two
young
soldiers
danced
with
ridiculous
grace
imitating
the
elegance
and
languorous
ecstasy
of
society
dancers
one
of
them
wore
a
hat
and
skirt
and
was
wonderfully
comic
i
stood
watching
them
a
little
stupefied
by
all
the
noise
and
tumult
of
this
night
and
with
a
sense
of
tragic
irony
remembering
millions
of
boys
who
lay
dead
in
quiet
fields
and
the
agony
of
many
peoples
in
europe
it
was
then
that
i
saw
young
harding
he
was
sitting
in
his
club
window
just
above
the
dancing
soldiers
and
looking
out
with
a
grave
and
rather
face
remarkable
in
contrast
with
the
laughing
faces
of
and
their
women
i
recognised
him
after
a
query
in
my
mind
and
said
harding
he
stared
at
me
and
i
saw
the
sudden
dawning
of
remembrance
in
he
answered
had
no
idea
you
were
back
again
so
i
went
into
his
club
and
sat
by
his
side
at
the
open
window
glad
of
this
retreat
from
the
pressure
and
tumult
of
the
mob
below
he
talked
conventionally
for
a
little
while
and
asked
me
whether
i
had
had
good
in
the
states
and
whether
i
was
busy
and
why
the
americans
seemed
so
hostile
to
president
wilson
i
understood
from
him
that
he
approved
of
the
peace
treaty
and
was
glad
that
germany
and
austria
had
been
off
the
as
far
as
it
was
humanly
possible
we
chatted
like
that
for
what
i
suppose
was
something
more
than
half
an
hour
while
we
looked
out
upon
the
seething
multitude
in
the
street
below
when
suddenly
the
mask
fell
from
him
so
abruptly
and
with
such
a
naked
revelation
of
a
soul
in
anguish
that
concealment
was
impossible
i
saw
him
lean
forward
with
his
elbows
on
the
windowsill
and
his
hands
clenching
an
iron
bar
his
face
had
become
like
his
shirt
front
almost
as
white
as
that
a
kind
of
groan
came
from
him
like
that
of
a
man
badly
wounded
the
people
on
either
side
of
him
turned
to
look
at
him
but
he
was
unconscious
of
them
as
he
stared
at
something
in
the
street
i
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
and
guessed
that
he
was
looking
at
a
which
had
been
stopped
by
the
crowd
who
were
surging
about
it
it
was
an
open
car
and
inside
were
a
young
man
and
woman
in
fancy
dress
as
pierrot
and
columbine
they
were
standing
up
and
pelting
the
crowd
with
long
coloured
streamers
which
the
mob
caught
and
tossed
back
again
with
shouts
of
laughter
the
girl
was
very
pretty
with
an
audacious
little
face
beneath
the
white
cap
and
her
eyes
were
on
fire
her
companion
was
a
fellow
and
for
he
had
not
chalked
it
to
whiteness
and
looked
to
me
typical
of
a
naval
officer
or
one
of
our
young
airmen
i
could
see
nothing
to
groan
about
in
such
a
sight
wrong
harding
i
touched
him
on
the
elbow
for
i
did
not
like
him
to
give
himself
away
before
the
other
company
in
the
he
rose
at
once
and
walked
in
a
stumbling
way
across
the
room
while
i
followed
the
room
was
empty
where
we
stood
you
well
i
asked
he
laughed
in
a
most
tragic
way
you
see
those
two
in
the
car
pierrot
and
columbine
i
nodded
was
my
wife
pierrot
is
now
her
husband
funny
it
my
memory
went
back
to
that
night
in
cologne
less
than
six
months
before
when
harding
had
asked
me
to
use
my
influence
to
get
him
demobilised
and
as
an
explanation
of
his
motive
opened
his
and
showed
me
the
photograph
of
a
pretty
girl
and
said
my
wife
she
is
hipped
because
i
have
been
away
so
i
felt
enormously
sorry
for
him
and
have
a
whisky
in
the
said
harding
like
a
yarn
and
we
shall
be
i
did
not
want
him
to
tell
me
his
tale
i
was
tired
of
tragic
history
but
i
could
not
refuse
the
boy
wanted
to
unburden
himself
i
could
see
that
though
for
quite
a
time
after
we
had
sat
on
each
side
of
the
wood
fire
he
hesitated
in
getting
to
the
point
and
indulged
in
small
talk
about
his
favourite
brand
of
cigars
and
my
evil
habit
of
smoking
the
worst
kind
of
cigarettes
suddenly
we
plunged
into
what
were
the
icy
waters
of
his
real
thoughts
my
wife
like
you
to
know
others
will
tell
you
and
have
heard
already
if
you
been
away
so
long
but
i
think
you
would
get
a
wrong
notion
from
others
the
fact
is
i
blame
evelyn
i
would
like
you
to
understand
that
i
blame
the
germans
for
germans
that
was
a
strange
statement
and
i
could
not
see
the
drift
of
it
until
he
explained
his
meaning
germans
made
the
war
and
the
war
took
me
away
from
evelyn
just
after
our
marriage
imagine
the
situation
a
kid
of
a
girl
wanting
to
be
merry
and
bright
eager
for
the
fun
of
life
and
all
that
left
alone
in
a
big
old
house
in
the
country
or
when
she
got
fed
up
with
that
in
a
big
gloomy
house
in
town
she
got
fed
up
with
both
pretty
quick
i
used
to
get
letters
from
her
every
day
for
a
while
and
she
used
to
say
in
every
one
of
them
fed
up
like
that
was
her
way
of
putting
it
you
know
and
i
got
scared
but
what
could
i
do
out
there
except
write
and
tell
her
to
try
and
get
busy
with
something
well
she
got
busy
all
right
harding
laughed
again
in
his
woeful
way
which
was
not
good
to
hear
then
he
became
angry
and
passionate
and
told
me
it
was
all
the
fault
of
damned
i
asked
him
what
women
and
he
launched
into
a
wild
denunciation
of
a
certain
set
of
women
most
of
the
names
he
mentioned
were
familiar
to
me
from
portraits
in
the
and
who
had
spent
the
years
of
war
in
organising
fancy
bazaars
charity
matinées
private
theatricals
for
red
cross
funds
all
that
as
harding
remarked
in
his
familiar
phrase
he
said
they
were
rotten
all
through
utterly
immoral
perfectly
callous
of
all
the
death
and
tragedy
about
them
except
in
a
false
hysterical
way
at
times
were
ghouls
he
said
many
of
them
had
married
twice
three
times
even
more
than
that
before
the
boys
who
were
killed
were
cold
in
their
graves
yet
those
were
the
best
with
a
certain
respect
for
convention
others
had
just
let
themselves
go
they
had
played
the
devil
with
any
fellow
who
came
within
their
circle
of
enticement
if
he
had
a
bit
of
money
or
could
dance
well
or
oiled
his
hair
in
the
right
way
corrupted
english
society
said
harding
they
smiled
and
danced
and
dressed
in
fancy
clothes
and
posed
for
their
photos
in
the
papers
it
was
they
who
corrupted
evelyn
when
the
poor
kid
was
fighting
up
against
her
loneliness
and
very
hipped
and
all
was
the
man
i
asked
and
harding
hesitated
before
he
told
me
it
was
with
frightful
irony
that
he
answered
usual
man
in
most
of
these
cases
the
man
who
is
often
best
pal
damn
him
harding
seemed
to
repent
of
that
curse
at
least
his
next
words
were
strangely
inconsistent
you
i
blame
him
either
it
was
i
who
sent
him
to
evelyn
he
was
in
the
dragoons
with
me
and
when
he
went
home
on
leave
i
said
and
cheer
up
my
little
wife
old
man
take
her
to
a
theatre
or
two
and
all
that
devilishly
needless
to
say
he
fell
in
love
with
her
i
might
have
known
it
as
for
evelyn
she
was
immensely
taken
with
young
dick
he
was
a
bit
of
a
humorist
and
made
her
laugh
laughter
was
a
devilish
good
thing
in
that
was
where
dick
had
his
pull
i
might
have
known
i
was
a
the
end
of
the
story
was
abrupt
and
at
the
time
i
found
it
hard
to
find
extenuating
circumstances
in
the
guilt
of
the
girl
who
had
smashed
this
boy
harding
she
lied
to
him
up
to
the
very
moment
of
his
demobilisation
at
least
she
gave
him
no
clue
to
her
purpose
until
she
hit
him
as
it
were
full
in
the
face
with
a
mortal
blow
to
his
happiness
he
had
sent
her
a
wire
with
the
one
word
and
then
had
taken
the
next
train
back
and
a
cab
from
charing
cross
to
that
house
of
his
at
rutland
gate
the
mistress
well
he
had
asked
one
of
the
maids
when
his
kit
was
handled
in
the
hall
mistress
is
out
sir
said
the
maid
and
he
remembered
afterwards
that
she
looked
queerly
at
him
with
a
kind
of
pity
there
was
the
usual
note
waiting
for
him
evelyn
was
she
hated
causing
her
husband
the
grief
she
knew
he
would
feel
but
she
and
dick
could
not
do
without
each
other
the
war
had
altered
everything
and
many
wives
to
many
husbands
she
hoped
harding
would
be
happy
after
a
bit
harding
was
not
happy
when
he
read
that
note
he
went
a
little
mad
and
roamed
round
london
with
an
automatic
pistol
determined
to
kill
his
former
friend
if
he
could
set
eyes
on
him
fortunately
he
did
not
find
him
evelyn
and
dick
had
gone
off
to
a
village
in
devonshire
and
after
three
days
with
murder
in
his
heart
harding
had
been
very
ill
and
had
gone
into
a
there
in
his
weakness
he
had
he
told
me
things
the
result
of
his
meditations
amounted
to
no
more
than
the
watchword
of
many
people
in
years
of
misery
la
guerre
it
was
the
war
which
had
caused
his
tragedy
it
had
put
too
great
a
strain
on
human
nature
or
at
least
on
human
nerves
and
morals
it
had
broken
down
the
conventions
and
traditions
of
civilised
life
the
germans
had
not
only
destroyed
many
towns
and
villages
but
many
homes
and
hearts
far
from
the
they
had
let
the
devil
loose
a
number
of
my
pals
said
harding
in
the
same
boat
with
me
they
either
stick
their
wives
or
their
wives
stick
them
it
gives
one
a
sense
of
companionship
he
smiled
in
a
melancholy
way
but
then
confessed
to
loneliness
so
many
of
his
real
pals
had
gone
west
and
asked
whether
he
could
call
on
me
now
and
then
it
was
for
that
reason
that
he
came
to
my
house
fairly
often
and
sometimes
fortune
who
came
too
at
times
made
him
laugh
as
in
the
old
days
iii
fortune
and
i
met
also
in
a
crowd
but
indoors
brand
and
eileen
were
both
to
be
at
one
of
the
evening
parties
which
assembled
every
now
and
then
in
a
flat
at
chelsea
belonging
to
susy
whincop
designer
of
stained
glass
driver
of
ambulances
for
the
scottish
convoy
and
sympathetic
friend
before
the
war
of
any
ardent
soul
who
grew
long
hair
if
a
man
short
hair
if
a
woman
and
had
some
special
scheme
philosophy
or
inspiration
for
the
welfare
of
humanity
i
had
known
susy
and
her
set
in
the
old
days
they
were
the
minor
intellectuals
of
london
and
i
had
portrayed
some
of
them
in
a
novel
called
mansions
which
they
did
not
like
though
i
loved
them
all
they
wrote
little
poems
painted
little
pictures
produced
little
plays
and
talked
about
all
subjects
under
heaven
with
humour
an
arrogance
towards
popular
ideas
and
a
quick
acceptance
of
the
new
the
unusual
and
the
revolutionary
in
art
and
thought
into
their
way
of
life
war
crashed
suddenly
with
its
thunder
notes
of
terror
all
that
they
had
lived
for
seemed
to
be
destroyed
and
all
their
ideals
overthrown
they
had
believed
in
beauty
and
it
was
flung
into
the
mud
and
bespattered
with
blood
and
buried
beneath
the
ugly
monsters
of
idolatry
they
had
been
devotees
of
liberty
and
were
made
slaves
of
the
drill
sergeant
and
other
instruments
of
martial
law
they
had
been
enemies
of
brutality
cruelty
violence
but
all
human
effort
now
was
for
the
slaughter
of
men
and
the
hero
was
he
who
killed
most
with
bayonet
or
bomb
their
pretty
verses
were
made
of
no
account
their
impressionistic
paintings
were
not
so
useful
as
the
camouflage
of
tin
huts
their
little
plays
were
but
feeble
drama
to
that
which
now
was
played
out
on
the
stage
to
the
roar
of
guns
and
the
march
of
armies
they
went
into
the
tumult
and
fury
of
it
all
and
were
lost
i
met
some
of
them
like
fortune
and
brand
in
odd
places
many
of
them
died
in
the
dirty
ditches
some
of
them
wrote
poems
before
they
died
stronger
than
their
work
before
the
war
with
a
noble
despair
or
the
exaltation
of
sacrifice
others
gave
no
sign
of
their
previous
life
and
were
just
absorbed
into
the
ranks
ants
in
these
legions
of
now
those
who
had
escaped
with
life
were
coming
back
to
their
old
haunts
trying
to
pick
up
old
threads
getting
back
if
they
could
to
the
old
ways
of
work
hoping
for
a
new
inspiration
out
of
immense
experience
but
not
yet
finding
it
in
susy
flat
some
of
them
had
gathered
when
i
went
there
and
when
i
looked
round
upon
them
seeing
here
and
there
faces
i
was
conscious
of
a
change
that
had
overtaken
them
and
with
a
shock
wondered
whether
i
too
had
altered
so
much
in
those
five
years
i
recognised
peter
hallam
whom
i
had
known
as
a
boy
just
down
from
oxford
with
a
genius
in
a
small
way
for
satirical
verse
and
a
talent
for
passionate
lyrics
of
a
morbid
and
erotic
type
yes
it
was
certainly
peter
though
his
face
had
hardened
and
he
had
cropped
his
hair
short
and
walked
with
one
leg
stiff
he
was
talking
to
a
girl
with
bobbed
hair
it
was
jennie
southcombe
who
had
been
one
of
the
heroines
of
the
serbian
retreat
according
to
accounts
of
newspaper
correspondents
battery
said
peter
into
old
fritz
with
open
sights
for
four
horns
we
just
mowed
another
face
rang
a
little
bell
in
my
memory
surely
that
was
alfred
lyon
the
futurist
painter
no
it
could
not
be
for
lyon
had
dressed
like
an
apache
and
this
man
was
in
conventional
evening
clothes
and
looked
like
a
brigadier
in
mufti
alfred
lyon
yes
there
he
was
though
he
had
lost
his
pose
cribbed
from
de
and
his
look
and
the
wildness
in
his
eyes
as
he
passed
susy
whincop
he
spoke
a
few
words
which
i
overheard
abandoned
futurism
the
present
knocked
that
silly
our
little
violence
which
shocked
suburbia
was
made
ridiculous
by
the
enormous
thing
that
smashed
every
convention
into
a
cocked
just
going
to
put
down
some
war
scenes
i
made
notes
in
the
trenches
with
that
simplicity
of
the
primitive
soul
to
which
we
went
back
in
that
way
of
life
the
point
of
view
his
vision
is
what
i
shall
try
said
susy
shrink
from
the
abomination
got
to
make
the
world
understand
and
i
felt
a
touch
on
my
sleeve
and
a
voice
said
back
again
i
turned
and
saw
an
man
with
white
hair
above
a
lean
face
and
sombre
eyes
i
stared
but
could
not
fix
him
you
remember
he
said
of
the
stage
society
lord
yes
i
grasped
his
hand
and
tried
to
keep
the
startled
look
out
of
my
eyes
but
he
saw
it
and
smiled
years
as
a
prisoner
of
the
turk
have
altered
me
a
bit
this
white
hair
eh
and
i
feel
like
rip
van
he
put
into
words
something
which
i
had
been
thinking
since
my
arrival
in
rooms
are
the
the
ghosts
who
have
come
back
to
their
old
haunts
we
are
pretending
that
everything
is
the
same
as
before
and
that
we
are
the
same
but
all
different
and
we
have
changed
most
of
all
five
years
of
war
have
dug
their
hoofs
into
the
faces
of
most
people
in
this
crowd
some
of
them
look
fifteen
twenty
years
older
and
i
expect
been
through
a
century
of
experience
and
coming
out
of
it
i
asked
big
from
us
said
wetherall
of
us
are
finished
our
nerves
have
gone
to
pieces
and
our
vitality
has
been
sapped
we
shall
put
down
a
few
notes
of
things
seen
and
understood
but
the
next
generation
that
will
get
the
big
vision
or
the
one
after
then
i
was
able
to
shake
hands
with
susy
whincop
and
as
i
have
said
she
left
me
in
no
doubt
about
the
change
that
four
years
of
war
had
made
to
me
she
held
me
at
length
studying
my
face
alive
she
said
been
through
it
all
right
have
been
busy
with
a
bad
as
that
i
asked
and
she
answered
very
gravely
bad
as
she
had
hardly
changed
except
for
a
few
streaks
of
grey
in
her
brown
hair
her
low
broad
forehead
was
as
smooth
as
before
her
brown
eyes
shone
with
their
old
steady
light
she
had
not
lost
her
sense
of
humour
though
she
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
blood
and
agony
and
death
humanity
i
asked
and
she
laughed
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
can
one
do
with
it
i
thought
we
were
going
to
catch
the
old
devil
by
the
tail
and
hold
him
fast
but
broken
loose
again
this
peace
dear
god
and
all
the
cruelty
and
hatred
that
have
survived
the
massacre
but
i
despair
even
now
in
this
room
there
is
enough
and
human
kindness
to
create
a
new
world
going
to
have
a
good
try
to
make
things
better
your
star
i
asked
is
the
particular
with
a
mission
to
convert
mankind
several
said
susy
she
glanced
round
the
room
and
her
eyes
rested
on
a
little
man
with
goggles
and
a
goatee
beard
none
other
than
my
good
friend
small
with
whom
i
had
travelled
down
many
roads
i
had
no
notion
that
he
knew
susy
or
was
to
be
here
one
great
soul
a
little
american
doctor
whose
heart
is
as
big
as
humanity
itself
and
whose
head
is
filled
with
the
wisdom
of
the
know
him
i
said
i
agree
with
he
caught
our
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
blinked
through
his
goggles
and
then
waved
his
hand
and
made
his
way
to
us
doc
i
said
you
tell
me
you
knew
susy
whincop
need
he
answered
whincop
is
the
golden
link
between
all
men
of
susy
was
pleased
with
that
she
patted
the
little
hand
and
said
for
you
doctor
and
may
the
stars
and
stripes
wave
over
the
league
of
nations
then
she
was
assailed
by
other
guests
and
the
doctor
and
i
took
refuge
in
a
corner
everything
i
asked
the
doctor
was
profoundly
dejected
and
did
not
hide
the
gloom
that
possessed
his
soul
he
answered
shall
have
to
fight
with
our
backs
to
the
wall
because
the
enemy
the
old
devil
is
prevailing
against
us
i
have
just
come
over
from
paris
and
i
mind
telling
you
that
what
i
saw
during
the
peace
conference
has
made
me
doubt
the
power
of
goodness
over
me
i
said
story
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
it
was
the
story
of
the
betrayal
one
by
one
of
every
ideal
for
which
simple
men
had
fought
and
died
a
story
of
broken
pledges
of
dethroned
and
of
great
peoples
condemned
to
lingering
death
the
peace
treaty
he
said
would
break
the
heart
of
the
world
and
prepare
the
way
for
new
more
dreadful
warfare
about
wilson
i
asked
the
little
doctor
raised
his
hands
like
a
german
crying
was
not
big
enough
he
had
the
future
of
civilisation
in
his
hands
but
his
power
was
filched
from
him
and
he
never
knew
until
the
end
that
he
had
lost
it
he
was
like
a
simple
gulliver
among
the
liliputians
they
tied
him
down
with
innumerable
threads
of
cotton
while
he
slept
in
with
a
sense
of
righteousness
he
was
among
people
he
stated
a
general
principle
and
they
drafted
out
clauses
which
seemed
to
fulfil
the
principle
while
violating
it
in
every
detail
they
juggled
with
facts
and
figures
so
that
black
seemed
white
through
his
moral
spectacles
and
he
said
amen
to
their
villainy
believing
that
god
had
been
served
by
righteousness
bit
by
bit
they
broke
his
pledges
and
made
a
jigsaw
puzzle
of
them
so
artfully
that
he
believed
they
were
uncracked
little
by
little
they
robbed
him
of
his
honour
and
he
was
unaware
of
the
theft
in
preambles
and
clause
headings
and
interpretations
they
gave
to
the
fourteen
points
upon
which
the
armistice
was
granted
and
to
which
the
allied
nations
were
utterly
pledged
not
only
to
the
germans
and
all
enemies
but
to
their
own
people
not
one
of
those
fourteen
points
is
in
the
reality
of
the
treaty
there
has
been
no
of
peoples
millions
have
been
transferred
into
unnatural
boundaries
there
have
been
no
open
covenants
openly
arrived
at
the
conference
was
within
closed
doors
the
clauses
of
the
peace
treaty
were
kept
secret
from
the
world
until
an
american
journalist
got
hold
of
a
copy
and
sent
it
to
his
paper
what
has
become
of
the
equality
of
trade
conditions
and
the
removal
of
economic
barriers
among
all
nations
consenting
to
peace
sonny
europe
has
been
carved
up
by
the
spirit
of
vengeance
and
multitudes
of
men
women
and
children
have
been
sentenced
to
death
by
starvation
another
militarism
is
enthroned
above
the
ruin
of
german
militarism
wilson
was
hoodwinked
into
putting
his
signature
to
a
peace
of
injustice
which
will
lead
by
desperation
to
world
anarchy
and
strife
when
he
understands
what
thing
he
has
done
he
will
be
stricken
by
a
mortal
blow
to
his
conscience
and
his
i
said
is
still
hope
in
the
league
of
nations
we
must
all
back
he
shook
his
head
spirit
has
gone
out
of
it
it
was
born
without
a
soul
i
believe
now
that
the
future
welfare
of
the
world
depends
upon
a
change
of
heart
among
the
peoples
inspired
by
individuals
in
all
nations
who
will
work
for
good
and
give
a
call
to
humanity
indifferent
to
statesmen
treaties
and
international
league
of
he
nodded
and
smiled
like
i
remembered
a
in
new
york
after
the
armistice
i
had
been
lecturing
on
the
league
of
nations
at
a
time
when
the
peace
treaty
was
still
unsigned
but
when
already
there
was
a
growing
hostility
against
president
wilson
startling
in
its
intensity
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
still
moved
by
the
emotion
and
idealism
with
which
they
had
roused
great
armies
and
sent
them
to
the
fields
of
france
some
of
the
men
were
returning
home
again
i
stood
outside
a
club
in
new
york
when
a
darkie
regiment
returned
its
colours
and
i
heard
the
roars
of
cheering
that
followed
the
march
of
the
negro
troops
i
saw
fifth
avenue
filled
with
triumphal
arches
strung
across
with
jewelled
chains
festooned
with
flags
and
trophies
of
the
of
the
new
york
division
the
heart
of
the
american
people
was
stirred
by
the
pride
of
its
achievement
on
the
way
to
victory
and
by
a
new
sense
of
power
over
the
destiny
of
mankind
but
already
there
was
a
sense
of
anxiety
about
the
responsibilities
to
which
wilson
in
europe
was
pledging
them
without
their
full
and
free
consent
they
were
conscious
that
their
old
isolation
was
being
broken
down
and
that
by
ignorance
or
rash
promise
they
might
be
drawn
into
other
european
adventures
which
were
no
concern
of
theirs
they
knew
how
little
was
their
knowledge
of
european
peoples
with
their
rivalries
and
racial
hatreds
and
secret
intrigues
their
own
destiny
as
a
free
people
might
be
thwarted
by
being
dragged
into
the
jungle
of
that
unknown
world
in
any
case
wilson
was
playing
a
lone
hand
pledging
them
without
their
advice
or
agreement
subordinating
them
it
seemed
to
the
british
empire
with
six
votes
on
the
council
of
the
league
to
their
poor
one
what
did
he
mean
by
what
right
did
he
do
so
at
every
these
questions
were
asked
before
the
soup
was
drunk
at
the
coffee
end
of
the
meal
every
was
a
debating
club
and
the
women
joined
with
the
men
in
hot
discussion
until
some
tactful
soul
laughed
loudly
and
some
hostess
led
the
way
to
music
or
a
dance
the
ladies
had
just
gone
after
one
of
these
debates
leaving
us
to
our
cigars
and
coffee
when
small
made
a
proposition
which
startled
me
at
the
time
here
he
said
to
his
host
and
the
other
men
of
this
discussion
one
thing
stands
clear
and
straight
it
is
that
in
this
room
now
at
this
table
are
men
of
intellect
american
and
english
men
of
goodwill
towards
mankind
men
of
power
in
one
way
or
another
who
agree
that
whatever
happens
there
must
be
eternal
friendship
between
england
and
the
united
said
a
chorus
of
voices
other
countries
there
are
men
with
the
same
ideals
as
ourselves
peace
justice
between
men
and
nations
a
hatred
of
cruelty
pity
for
women
and
children
charity
and
truth
is
that
agreed
said
the
other
guests
they
were
mostly
business
men
but
not
of
the
class
with
here
and
there
a
an
artist
and
as
i
remember
a
clergyman
am
going
to
be
a
commercial
traveller
in
charity
said
the
little
doctor
am
going
across
the
frontiers
to
collect
clients
for
an
international
society
of
goodwill
i
propose
to
establish
a
branch
at
this
the
suggestion
was
received
with
laughter
by
some
of
the
men
but
as
i
saw
with
gravity
by
others
would
be
the
responsibilities
doctor
do
you
want
money
this
was
from
the
manager
of
an
american
railroad
shall
want
a
bit
said
the
doctor
much
enough
for
stamps
and
occasional
booklets
and
typewriting
the
chief
responsibility
would
be
to
spot
lies
leading
to
national
antagonism
and
to
kill
them
by
exposure
to
cold
truth
also
to
put
in
friendly
words
privately
and
publicly
on
behalf
of
human
kindness
across
the
barriers
of
hate
and
malignity
any
names
for
the
new
york
branch
the
doctor
took
down
twelve
names
pledged
solemnly
to
his
programmes
i
remembered
that
scene
in
new
york
when
i
stood
with
the
little
man
in
susy
about
this
crowd
i
asked
he
said
place
is
reeking
with
humanity
the
real
stuff
idealists
who
have
seen
hell
pretty
close
most
of
them
why
in
this
room
enough
goodwill
to
move
mountains
of
cruelty
if
we
could
get
a
move
on
all
it
was
then
that
i
saw
charles
fortune
though
i
was
looking
for
brand
fortune
was
wearing
one
of
his
special
i
interpreted
it
as
his
soulful
and
mystical
face
it
broke
a
little
as
he
winked
at
me
gathering
he
said
intellectuals
come
back
to
their
lair
some
of
them
like
little
who
lost
her
sheep
and
left
their
tails
behind
does
that
mean
i
asked
he
answered
used
to
talk
like
that
trying
to
grope
he
put
his
hand
over
his
forehead
wearily
he
said
terrible
was
war
in
a
nissen
hut
i
can
not
even
now
forget
that
i
was
every
yard
a
soldier
he
began
to
hum
his
anthem
bill
the
butcher
of
the
boche
and
then
checked
himself
let
us
forget
that
melody
of
blood
let
us
rather
sing
of
fragrant
things
of
he
hummed
the
nursery
ballad
of
twinkle
little
star
how
i
wonder
what
you
are
susy
whincop
seized
him
by
the
wrist
the
fat
boy
has
escaped
the
massacre
come
and
make
us
laugh
we
are
getting
too
serious
at
the
piano
end
of
the
said
fortune
me
not
to
my
irony
is
terrible
when
as
he
went
to
the
piano
i
caught
sight
of
brand
just
making
his
way
through
a
group
by
the
door
i
had
never
seen
him
in
civil
clothes
but
he
looked
as
i
had
imagined
him
in
an
old
and
baggy
trousers
and
a
shirt
that
bulged
abominably
a
tuft
of
hair
stuck
up
behind
the
tuft
that
eileen
had
pulled
for
auld
lang
syne
but
he
looked
fine
and
distinguished
with
his
hard
lean
face
and
strong
jaw
and
melancholy
eyes
he
caught
sight
of
me
and
gripped
my
hand
painfully
old
man
welcome
back
i
have
heaps
to
tell
things
i
asked
he
shook
his
head
good
damned
bad
alas
he
did
not
continue
the
conversation
he
stared
across
my
shoulder
at
the
door
as
though
he
saw
an
apparition
i
turned
to
see
the
object
of
his
gaze
it
was
eileen
whom
i
had
first
met
in
lille
she
was
in
an
evening
frock
cut
low
at
the
neck
and
her
arms
were
bare
there
was
a
smile
in
her
dark
irish
eyes
and
about
her
long
humorous
mouth
the
girl
i
had
seen
in
lille
was
not
so
elegant
as
this
not
so
pretty
the
lifting
of
care
perhaps
had
made
the
change
susy
whincop
gave
a
cry
of
that
eileen
and
darted
to
her
myself
said
eileen
releasing
herself
from
an
ardent
embrace
all
the
better
for
seeing
you
who
in
this
distinguished
crowd
friends
i
said
being
nearest
to
her
men
who
walked
one
day
of
history
up
a
street
in
lille
and
met
an
irish
girl
who
had
the
worship
of
the
she
took
my
hand
and
i
was
glad
of
her
look
of
friendship
she
said
too
good
to
be
true
all
safe
and
home
again
it
was
astonishing
that
four
of
us
should
be
there
in
a
room
in
london
with
the
girl
who
had
been
the
heroine
of
lille
but
there
was
fortune
and
small
and
brand
and
myself
the
crowd
gave
us
while
we
stood
round
eileen
to
each
she
gave
her
hands
both
hands
and
merry
words
of
greeting
it
was
only
i
and
she
perhaps
who
saw
the
gloom
on
face
when
she
greeted
him
last
and
said
it
well
with
you
wickham
her
colour
rose
a
little
at
the
sight
of
him
and
he
was
paler
than
when
i
saw
him
first
that
night
well
he
said
still
needs
courage
even
in
he
laughed
a
little
as
he
spoke
but
i
knew
that
his
laughter
was
the
camouflage
of
hidden
trouble
at
which
he
had
hinted
in
his
letters
to
me
we
could
not
have
much
talk
that
evening
the
groups
shifted
and
the
best
thing
was
when
eileen
sang
gentle
as
on
a
night
in
lille
brand
standing
near
the
door
listened
strangely
unconscious
of
the
people
about
him
good
to
hear
that
song
again
i
said
he
started
as
though
suddenly
awakened
stirs
queer
old
it
was
in
own
house
that
brand
and
i
renewed
a
friendship
which
had
been
made
in
a
rescued
city
where
we
had
heard
the
adventure
of
this
life
iv
as
brand
admitted
to
me
and
as
he
had
outlined
the
trouble
in
his
letters
he
was
having
bad
since
his
marriage
with
elsa
von
kreuzenach
he
had
not
had
much
peace
of
mind
nor
any
kind
of
luck
after
leaving
cologne
the
war
office
prompted
by
some
unknown
influence
he
suspected
his
father
who
knew
the
secretary
for
war
had
sent
him
off
on
a
special
mission
to
italy
and
had
delayed
his
demobilisation
until
a
month
before
this
meeting
of
ours
that
had
prevented
his
plan
of
bringing
elsa
to
england
and
now
when
he
was
free
and
her
journey
possible
he
was
seriously
embarrassed
with
regard
to
a
home
for
her
there
was
plenty
of
room
in
his
house
at
cheyne
walk
chelsea
too
big
a
house
for
his
father
and
mother
and
younger
sister
now
that
the
eldest
girl
had
married
and
his
younger
brother
lay
dead
on
the
somme
it
had
been
his
idea
that
he
and
elsa
would
live
in
the
upper
rooms
it
made
a
kind
of
flat
while
he
got
back
to
until
he
earned
enough
to
provide
a
home
of
his
own
it
was
still
his
idea
as
the
only
possible
place
for
the
immediate
future
but
the
family
was
dead
against
it
and
expressed
the
utmost
aversion
amounting
almost
to
horror
at
the
idea
of
receiving
his
german
wife
by
violent
argument
by
appeals
to
reason
and
charity
most
of
all
by
the
firm
conviction
of
his
father
that
he
was
suffering
from
and
would
go
over
the
borderline
of
sanity
if
thwarted
too
much
a
grudging
consent
had
been
obtained
from
them
to
give
elsa
yet
he
dreaded
the
coldness
of
her
welcome
and
the
hostility
not
only
of
his
own
people
but
of
any
english
society
in
which
she
might
find
herself
have
believed
said
brand
such
vindictive
hatred
could
have
outlasted
the
war
in
england
the
people
here
at
home
who
have
never
seen
war
closer
than
an
are
poisoned
twisted
and
envenomed
with
hate
and
the
women
are
worst
my
own
mother
so
sweet
and
gentle
in
the
old
days
would
see
every
german
baby
starve
rather
than
subscribe
to
a
single
drop
of
milk
my
own
sister
twenty
years
of
age
add
as
holy
as
an
angel
would
scratch
out
the
eyes
of
every
german
girl
she
reads
the
papers
every
day
with
a
feverish
desire
for
the
trial
she
licks
her
lips
at
the
stories
of
starvation
in
austria
are
getting
punished
she
says
i
ask
her
babies
and
she
says
people
who
killed
my
brother
and
the
good
of
telling
her
that
i
have
killed
brothers
many
of
them
even
the
brother
of
my
wife
i
shook
my
head
at
that
but
brand
was
insistent
sure
of
it
it
is
useless
telling
her
that
the
innocent
are
being
punished
for
the
guilty
and
that
all
europe
was
involved
in
the
same
guilt
she
says
have
altered
your
ideas
the
strain
of
war
has
been
too
much
for
she
means
mad
or
bad
sometimes
i
think
i
may
be
but
when
i
think
of
those
scenes
in
cologne
the
friendly
way
of
our
fighting
men
with
their
former
enemy
the
charity
of
our
tommies
their
lack
of
hatred
now
the
job
is
done
i
look
at
these
people
in
england
the
and
believe
it
is
they
who
are
the
news
of
marriage
with
a
german
girl
had
leaked
out
though
his
people
tried
to
hush
it
up
it
came
to
me
now
and
then
as
a
of
scandal
from
men
who
had
been
up
at
oxford
with
him
in
the
old
days
know
that
fellow
wickham
brand
the
rumour
about
him
say
got
a
german
wife
married
her
after
the
not
that
question
of
mine
made
them
stare
as
though
i
had
uttered
some
blasphemy
generally
they
did
not
attempt
to
answer
it
but
shrugged
their
shoulders
with
a
look
of
unutterable
disgust
or
said
they
were
men
invariably
who
had
done
work
in
the
war
in
government
offices
and
soft
jobs
soldiers
who
had
fought
their
way
to
cologne
were
more
lenient
one
of
them
said
of
the
german
girls
are
devilish
pretty
not
my
style
perhaps
but
i
saw
something
of
trouble
when
i
walked
down
knightsbridge
with
him
one
day
on
the
way
to
his
home
in
chelsea
horace
chipchase
the
novelist
came
face
to
face
with
us
and
gave
a
whoop
of
pleasure
when
he
saw
us
then
suddenly
after
shaking
hand
with
me
and
greeting
brand
warmly
he
remembered
the
rumour
that
had
reached
him
embarrassment
overcame
him
and
ignoring
brand
he
confined
his
remarks
to
me
awkwardly
and
made
an
excuse
for
getting
on
he
did
not
look
at
brand
again
strained
in
his
manner
i
remarked
glancing
sideways
at
wickham
he
strode
on
with
tightened
lips
rooms
with
me
once
and
i
helped
him
when
he
was
badly
in
need
of
it
heard
about
elsa
silly
blighter
but
it
hurt
the
man
who
was
very
sensitive
under
his
hard
crust
it
was
on
the
way
to
his
house
that
he
told
me
he
had
made
arrangements
at
last
for
elsa
to
join
him
in
england
one
of
his
friends
at
headquarters
in
cologne
was
providing
her
with
a
passport
and
had
agreed
to
let
her
travel
with
him
to
paris
where
he
was
to
give
evidence
before
a
committee
of
the
peace
conference
brand
could
fetch
her
from
there
in
a
time
am
going
to
paris
next
week
i
told
him
and
he
gave
a
grunt
of
pleasure
and
said
we
can
both
meet
i
thought
it
curious
then
and
afterwards
that
he
was
anxious
for
my
company
when
he
met
his
wife
and
when
she
was
with
him
i
think
the
presence
of
a
third
person
helped
him
to
throw
off
a
little
of
the
melancholy
into
which
he
relapsed
when
alone
i
asked
him
if
family
knew
of
her
marriage
and
were
reconciled
to
it
and
he
told
me
that
they
knew
but
were
less
reconciled
now
than
when
she
had
first
broken
the
news
to
her
father
and
mother
on
the
day
of
her
wedding
then
there
had
been
a
family
the
general
had
raged
and
stormed
and
his
wife
had
wept
but
after
that
outburst
had
decided
to
forgive
her
in
order
to
avoid
a
family
scandal
there
had
been
a
formidable
assembly
of
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
of
the
von
kreuzenach
family
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
this
affair
which
as
they
said
their
honour
and
description
of
it
and
of
her
terror
and
sense
of
guilt
it
is
not
easy
to
break
with
racial
traditions
was
very
humorous
though
at
the
same
time
rather
pathetic
they
had
graciously
decided
after
prolonged
discussions
in
which
they
treated
elsa
exactly
as
though
she
were
the
prisoner
at
a
to
acknowledge
and
accept
her
marriage
with
captain
brand
they
had
been
led
to
this
decision
mainly
owing
to
the
information
given
by
franz
von
kreuzenach
that
captain
brand
belonged
to
the
english
aristocracy
his
father
being
sir
amyas
brand
and
a
member
of
the
english
house
of
parliament
they
were
willing
to
admit
that
inferior
as
captain
family
might
be
to
that
of
von
kreuzenach
so
old
and
honoured
in
german
history
it
was
yet
respectable
and
not
unworthy
of
alliance
with
them
possibly
it
was
an
idea
suggested
with
enormous
solemnity
by
onkel
von
kreuzenach
marriage
with
the
son
of
an
english
member
of
parliament
might
be
of
service
to
the
in
obtaining
some
amelioration
of
the
peace
terms
the
treaty
was
not
yet
signed
and
in
counteracting
the
harsh
malignity
of
france
they
must
endeavour
to
use
this
opportunity
provided
by
elsa
in
every
possible
way
as
a
patriotic
duty
so
at
the
end
of
the
family
conclave
elsa
was
not
only
forgiven
but
was
to
some
extent
exalted
as
an
instrument
of
god
for
the
rescue
of
their
beloved
germany
that
position
of
hers
lasted
in
her
family
until
the
terms
of
the
peace
treaty
leaked
out
and
then
were
published
in
full
a
storm
of
indignation
rose
in
germany
and
elsa
was
a
private
victim
of
its
violence
in
her
own
house
the
combined
clauses
of
the
treaty
were
read
as
a
sentence
of
death
by
the
german
people
clause
by
clause
they
believed
it
fastened
a
doom
upon
them
and
insured
their
ruin
it
condemned
them
to
the
payment
of
indemnities
which
would
demand
all
the
produce
of
their
industry
for
many
and
uncertain
years
it
reduced
them
to
the
position
of
a
slave
state
without
an
army
without
a
fleet
without
colonies
without
the
right
to
develop
industries
in
foreign
countries
without
ships
to
carry
their
merchandise
without
coal
to
supply
their
factories
or
raw
material
for
their
manufactures
to
enforce
the
payment
of
these
indemnities
foreign
commissions
would
seize
all
german
capital
invested
in
former
enemy
or
neutral
states
and
would
keep
armed
forces
on
the
rhine
ready
to
march
at
any
time
years
after
the
conclusion
of
peace
into
the
heart
of
germany
the
german
people
might
work
but
not
for
themselves
they
had
freed
themselves
of
their
own
tyrants
but
were
to
be
subject
to
an
international
tyranny
depriving
them
of
all
hope
of
gradual
recovery
from
the
ruin
of
defeat
on
the
west
and
on
the
east
austria
was
to
be
hemmed
in
by
new
states
formed
out
of
her
own
under
the
domination
of
hostile
races
she
was
to
be
maimed
and
strangled
the
fourteen
points
to
which
the
allies
had
pledged
themselves
before
the
armistice
had
been
abandoned
utterly
and
promise
of
a
peace
which
would
heal
the
wounds
of
the
world
had
been
replaced
by
a
peace
of
vengeance
which
would
plunge
central
europe
into
deep
gulfs
of
misery
despair
and
disease
that
at
least
was
the
german
point
of
view
stunned
said
brand
knew
they
were
to
be
punished
and
they
were
willing
to
pay
a
vast
price
of
defeat
but
they
believed
that
under
a
republican
government
they
would
be
left
with
a
future
hope
of
progress
a
decent
hope
of
life
based
upon
their
industry
now
they
have
no
hope
for
we
have
given
them
a
thin
chance
of
reconstruction
they
are
falling
back
upon
the
hope
of
vengeance
and
revolt
we
have
prepared
another
inevitable
war
when
the
germans
with
the
help
of
russia
will
strive
to
break
the
fetters
we
have
fastened
on
them
so
goes
the
only
purpose
for
which
most
of
us
fought
this
war
and
all
our
pals
have
died
in
he
stopped
in
the
street
and
beat
the
pavement
with
his
stick
damned
stupidity
of
it
all
he
said
infernal
wickedness
of
those
old
men
who
have
arranged
this
thing
three
small
boys
came
galloping
up
cheyne
walk
with
toy
reins
and
tinkling
bells
children
said
brand
see
the
things
that
we
have
seen
and
go
into
the
ditches
of
death
before
their
manhood
has
been
fulfilled
we
fought
to
save
them
and
have
he
told
me
that
even
elsa
had
been
aghast
at
the
peace
terms
hoped
more
from
the
generous
soul
of
england
she
had
written
to
him
franz
von
kreuzenach
had
written
more
bitterly
than
that
have
been
betrayed
there
were
millions
of
young
men
in
germany
who
would
have
worked
loyally
to
fulfil
conditions
of
peace
as
they
were
pledged
in
his
fourteen
points
they
would
have
taken
their
punishment
with
patience
and
courage
knowing
the
penalty
of
defeat
they
would
have
worked
for
the
new
ideals
of
a
new
age
which
were
to
be
greater
liberty
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
in
a
league
of
nations
but
what
is
that
league
it
is
a
combination
of
enemies
associated
for
the
purpose
of
crushing
the
german
people
and
keeping
her
crushed
i
who
loved
england
and
had
no
emnity
against
her
even
in
war
can
not
forgive
her
now
for
her
share
in
this
peace
as
a
german
i
find
it
unforgivable
because
it
perpetuates
the
spirit
of
hatred
and
thrusts
us
back
into
the
darkness
where
evil
is
you
agree
with
that
i
asked
brand
the
whole
yes
he
said
gravely
you
not
against
punishing
germany
she
had
to
be
punished
but
we
are
substituting
slow
torture
for
just
retribution
and
like
franz
thinking
of
the
effect
on
the
future
by
generosity
we
should
have
made
the
world
safe
by
vengeance
we
have
prepared
new
strife
europe
will
be
given
up
to
anarchy
and
deluged
in
the
blood
of
the
boys
who
are
now
i
had
dinner
with
people
and
found
them
sir
amyas
brand
had
outward
hardness
and
none
of
his
inner
sensibility
he
was
a
stiff
pompous
man
who
had
done
extremely
well
out
of
the
war
i
guessed
by
the
manufacture
of
wooden
huts
to
which
he
attached
a
patriotic
significance
apart
from
his
profits
he
alluded
to
the
death
of
his
younger
son
as
his
for
the
empire
though
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
boy
jack
had
been
the
real
victim
of
to
wickham
he
behaved
with
an
exasperating
air
of
forgiveness
as
to
one
who
had
sinned
and
was
physically
and
morally
sick
do
you
think
wickham
is
looking
he
asked
me
at
table
and
when
i
said
well
he
sighed
and
shook
his
head
war
was
a
severe
nervous
strain
upon
mm
it
has
changed
him
sadly
we
try
to
be
patient
with
him
poor
brand
overheard
his
speech
and
flushed
angrily
sorry
i
try
your
patience
so
severely
sir
he
said
in
a
bitter
ironical
way
argue
about
it
dear
lad
said
sir
amyas
brand
suavely
said
lady
brand
plaintively
know
argument
is
bad
for
you
wickham
you
become
so
violent
said
ethel
brand
the
daughter
in
a
low
and
resigned
voice
done
be
elsa
asked
wickham
savagely
i
could
see
that
but
for
my
restraining
presence
as
a
stranger
there
was
all
the
inflammable
stuff
here
for
a
domestic
else
asked
ethel
coldly
and
meeting
her
challenging
eyes
with
a
perfectly
steady
gaze
she
was
a
handsome
girl
with
regular
classical
features
and
tight
lips
as
i
imagined
as
a
spinster
in
a
cathedral
town
and
as
hard
as
granite
in
principle
and
prejudice
wickham
weakened
after
signs
of
an
explosion
of
rage
he
spoke
gently
and
revealed
a
hope
to
which
i
think
he
clung
desperately
elsa
comes
you
will
all
fall
in
love
with
it
was
the
worst
thing
he
could
have
said
though
he
was
unconscious
of
his
his
sister
ethel
reddened
and
i
could
see
her
mouth
harden
far
i
have
remarkably
little
love
for
germans
male
or
hope
we
shall
behave
with
christian
charity
said
lady
brand
sir
amyas
brand
coughed
uneasily
and
then
tried
to
laugh
off
his
embarrassment
for
my
benefit
will
be
considerable
scandal
in
my
constituency
hell
with
that
said
brand
irritably
about
time
the
british
public
returned
to
said
sir
amyas
a
narrow
between
sanity
and
really
it
is
distressing
what
a
number
of
men
seem
to
come
back
with
disordered
nerves
all
these
crimes
all
these
cases
of
violence
it
gave
him
a
chance
of
repeating
a
leading
article
which
he
had
read
that
morning
in
it
provided
a
conversation
without
controversy
until
the
end
of
dinner
in
the
hall
before
i
left
wickham
brand
laughed
rather
miserably
not
going
to
be
easy
elsa
will
find
the
climate
rather
cold
here
eh
will
win
them
over
i
said
hopefully
and
these
words
cheered
him
yes
bound
to
like
we
arranged
for
the
paris
trip
two
weeks
later
but
before
then
we
were
sure
to
meet
at
eileen
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
dined
together
with
small
next
day
and
eileen
was
with
him
v
i
found
eileen
refreshing
and
invigorating
so
that
it
was
good
to
be
in
her
company
most
people
in
england
at
that
time
at
least
those
i
met
were
depressed
and
apprehensive
of
evil
to
come
there
was
hardly
a
family
i
knew
who
had
not
one
vacant
chair
wherein
a
boy
had
sat
when
he
had
come
home
from
school
or
office
and
afterwards
on
leave
their
ghosts
haunted
these
homes
and
were
present
in
any
company
where
people
gathered
for
conversation
or
distraction
the
wound
to
soul
was
unhealed
and
the
men
who
came
back
had
received
grave
hurt
many
of
them
to
their
nervous
and
moral
health
this
irish
girl
was
beautifully
gay
not
with
that
deliberate
and
artificial
gaiety
which
filled
london
theatres
and
dancing
halls
but
with
ah
inner
flame
of
happiness
it
was
difficult
to
account
for
that
she
had
seen
much
tragedy
in
lille
death
and
the
agony
of
men
had
been
familiar
to
her
she
had
faced
death
herself
very
closely
escaping
as
she
said
by
a
narrow
she
had
seen
the
brutality
of
war
and
its
welter
of
misery
for
men
and
women
and
now
in
time
of
peace
she
was
conscious
of
the
sufferings
of
many
people
and
did
not
hide
these
things
from
her
mental
vision
or
cry
right
with
the
world
when
all
was
wrong
but
something
in
her
character
something
perhaps
in
her
faith
enabled
her
to
resist
the
pressure
of
all
this
and
to
face
it
squarely
with
smiling
eyes
another
thing
that
attracted
one
was
her
fearlessness
of
truth
at
a
time
when
most
people
shrank
from
truth
her
candour
was
marvellous
with
the
simplicity
of
childhood
joined
to
the
wisdom
of
womanhood
i
saw
this
at
the
for
four
arranged
in
her
honour
by
small
that
was
given
for
sake
at
a
little
old
restaurant
in
whitehall
which
provided
a
good
dinner
for
a
few
shillings
and
in
an
of
respectability
which
appealed
to
the
little
american
eileen
knocked
brand
edgewise
at
the
beginning
of
his
dinner
by
remarking
about
his
german
marriage
news
came
to
me
as
a
shock
she
said
and
when
wickham
raised
his
eyebrows
and
looked
both
surprised
and
dismayed
he
had
counted
on
her
sympathy
and
help
she
patted
his
hand
as
it
played
a
tattoo
on
the
and
launched
into
a
series
of
indiscretions
that
fairly
made
my
hair
curl
she
said
the
least
objection
to
your
marrying
a
german
girl
i
have
always
believed
that
love
is
an
instinct
which
is
beyond
the
control
of
diplomats
who
arrange
frontiers
and
generals
who
direct
wars
i
saw
a
lot
of
it
in
lille
and
there
was
franz
von
kreuzenach
who
fell
in
love
with
me
poor
child
what
really
hurt
me
for
a
while
was
small
laughed
hilariously
and
filled
up
glass
with
moselle
wine
brand
looked
blank
yes
said
eileen
me
an
irish
girl
all
soppy
with
emotion
at
the
first
sight
of
english
khaki
a
fantastic
situation
anyhow
after
four
years
with
the
grey
men
and
then
finding
that
the
first
khaki
tunic
she
meets
holds
the
body
of
a
man
she
knew
as
a
boy
when
she
used
to
pull
his
hair
and
such
a
grave
man
wicky
why
i
felt
like
one
of
ladies
released
from
her
dark
tower
by
a
knight
of
the
round
tower
then
you
went
away
and
married
a
german
gretchen
and
all
my
doing
because
if
i
given
you
a
letter
to
franz
you
have
met
elsa
so
when
i
heard
the
news
i
thought
goes
my
romance
small
laughed
again
joyously
my
dear
he
said
making
poor
old
wickham
blush
like
an
englishman
asked
to
tell
the
story
of
his
in
brand
laughed
too
in
his
harsh
deep
voice
eileen
you
ought
to
have
told
me
before
i
moved
out
of
where
would
maiden
modesty
have
been
asked
eileen
in
her
humorous
way
is
it
now
asked
the
little
doctor
said
brand
had
that
letter
to
franz
von
kreuzenach
in
my
pocket
i
mind
telling
you
i
detested
the
fellow
for
his
infernal
impudence
in
making
love
to
now
it
was
a
affair
entirely
said
eileen
exaggerating
her
irish
accent
one
has
to
be
polite
to
a
gentleman
that
saves
life
on
account
of
a
romantic
passion
oh
wickham
very
english
you
are
brand
could
find
nothing
to
say
for
himself
and
it
was
i
who
came
to
the
rescue
of
his
embarrassment
by
dragging
a
red
herring
across
the
thread
of
discourse
she
had
a
wonderful
way
of
saying
things
that
on
most
lips
would
have
seemed
audacious
or
improper
or
but
on
hers
were
natural
with
a
simplicity
which
shone
through
her
her
sense
of
humour
played
like
a
light
about
her
words
yet
beneath
her
wit
was
a
tenderness
and
a
knowledge
of
tragic
things
i
remember
some
of
her
sayings
that
night
at
dinner
and
they
seemed
to
me
very
good
then
though
when
put
down
they
lose
the
deep
melody
of
her
voice
and
the
smile
or
sadness
of
her
dark
eyes
she
said
the
war
for
liberty
and
the
rights
of
small
nations
but
said
to
ireland
keep
quiet
there
damn
you
or
make
us
look
soldiers
she
said
england
to
win
all
her
wars
but
mostly
in
scottish
regiments
when
the
poor
boys
wanted
to
carry
an
irish
flag
kitchener
said
to
hell
and
some
of
them
went
to
flanders
and
recruiting
stopped
with
a
how
do
you
know
these
things
asked
small
kitchener
go
to
lille
to
tell
you
said
eileen
i
found
some
of
the
dublin
boys
in
the
prison
at
lille
and
they
told
the
truth
before
they
died
and
perhaps
it
was
that
which
killed
them
that
and
starvation
and
german
believe
a
sinn
feiner
said
small
you
go
to
ireland
and
show
your
true
colours
sinn
fein
all
right
said
eileen
i
hated
the
look
of
a
white
wall
in
lille
and
there
are
so
many
white
walls
in
the
little
green
isle
so
stopping
in
kensington
and
trying
to
hate
the
english
but
because
i
love
she
turned
to
wickham
and
said
you
take
me
for
a
row
in
kensington
gardens
the
very
next
day
the
sun
shines
said
wickham
one
condition
that
be
kind
to
my
little
elsa
when
she
be
a
mother
to
her
said
eileen
she
must
come
quick
or
be
wickham
spoke
with
dismay
in
his
voice
i
think
he
had
counted
on
eileen
as
his
when
elsa
would
need
a
friend
in
england
now
said
small
my
secret
you
wicked
lady
with
black
eyes
and
a
mystical
said
eileen
own
president
rebukes
you
covenants
openly
arrived
at
those
his
words
for
the
new
diplomacy
to
god
he
had
kept
to
them
said
the
little
doctor
bitterly
launching
into
a
denunciation
of
the
peace
conference
until
i
cut
him
short
with
a
question
this
secret
doctor
he
pulled
out
his
with
an
air
of
mystery
getting
on
with
the
international
league
of
goodwill
he
said
making
more
progress
than
the
league
of
nations
there
are
names
here
that
are
worth
their
weight
in
gold
there
are
golden
promises
which
by
the
grace
of
god
small
spoke
solemnly
be
fulfilled
by
golden
deeds
anyhow
going
to
get
a
move
on
away
from
hatred
towards
charity
not
for
the
making
of
wounds
but
for
the
healing
not
punishing
the
innocent
for
the
sins
of
the
guilty
but
saving
the
innocent
the
holy
innocents
for
the
glory
of
life
miss
eileen
and
others
are
going
to
be
the
instruments
of
the
machinery
of
mercy
rather
i
should
say
the
spirit
of
you
as
our
gallant
leader
said
eileen
patting
his
hand
sounds
good
said
brand
hear
some
small
told
us
more
in
glowing
language
and
in
biblical
utterance
mixed
with
american
slang
like
billy
bible
he
was
profoundly
moved
he
was
filled
with
hope
and
gladness
and
with
a
humble
pride
because
his
efforts
had
borne
fruit
the
scheme
was
simple
from
his
friends
in
the
united
states
he
had
promises
as
good
as
gold
of
many
millions
of
american
dollars
from
english
friends
he
had
also
considerable
sums
with
this
treasure
he
was
going
to
central
europe
to
organise
relief
on
a
big
scale
for
the
children
who
were
starving
to
death
eileen
was
to
be
his
private
secretary
and
she
would
have
heaps
of
work
to
do
and
she
had
graduated
in
the
prisons
and
slums
of
lille
they
were
starting
in
a
time
for
warsaw
prague
and
vienna
said
brand
will
lose
a
her
too
said
eileen
work
for
brand
was
startled
by
this
and
a
sudden
light
leapt
into
his
eyes
jove
but
afraid
not
so
it
was
only
a
week
we
had
with
eileen
but
in
that
time
we
had
some
good
meetings
and
merry
adventures
brand
and
i
rowed
her
on
the
lake
in
kensington
gardens
and
she
told
us
irish
as
she
sat
in
the
stem
with
her
hat
in
her
lap
and
the
wind
playing
in
her
brown
hair
we
took
her
to
the
russian
ballet
and
she
wept
a
little
at
the
beauty
of
it
four
years
of
war
she
said
is
like
water
to
a
parched
soul
so
exquisite
it
she
took
us
one
day
into
the
carmelite
church
at
kensington
and
brand
and
i
knelt
each
side
of
her
feeling
sinners
with
a
saint
between
us
and
then
less
like
a
saint
she
sang
ribald
little
songs
on
the
way
to
her
house
in
holland
street
and
said
the
thing
when
she
find
her
key
to
unlock
the
door
biddy
my
dear
she
said
to
the
little
maidservant
who
opened
the
door
shall
forget
my
head
one
miss
eileen
said
the
girl
never
the
dear
heart
of
you
at
all
at
mother
was
a
buxom
cheery
smiling
irishwoman
who
did
not
worry
i
fancy
about
anything
in
the
world
and
was
sure
of
heaven
her
was
littered
with
papers
and
novels
some
of
which
she
swept
off
the
sofa
with
a
careless
hand
you
take
a
seat
then
i
asked
her
whether
she
had
not
been
anxious
about
her
daughter
when
eileen
was
all
those
years
under
german
rule
at
all
said
the
lady
knew
our
dear
lord
was
as
near
to
lille
as
to
two
of
her
boys
had
been
killed
in
the
war
she
said
an
ungrateful
country
which
keeps
its
heel
on
the
neck
of
ireland
and
two
were
in
the
united
states
working
for
the
honour
of
ireland
on
american
newspapers
two
sisters
had
married
during
the
war
and
between
them
had
given
birth
to
four
sinn
feiners
father
had
died
a
year
ago
and
almost
his
last
word
had
been
her
name
dear
man
thought
all
the
world
of
eileen
said
was
out
of
it
entirely
when
he
had
her
by
his
be
lonely
said
brand
your
daughter
goes
abroad
eileen
answered
him
you
keep
me
back
by
insidious
remarks
like
that
mother
spends
most
of
her
days
in
church
and
the
rest
of
them
reading
naughty
novels
which
keep
her
from
ascending
straight
to
heaven
without
the
necessity
of
dying
first
she
is
never
lonely
because
her
spirit
is
in
touch
with
those
she
loves
in
this
world
or
the
other
and
that
the
truth
after
talking
mother
mine
never
knew
more
than
one
who
told
the
truth
yet
said
the
lady
yourself
my
dear
and
a
frightening
way
you
have
with
it
that
would
scare
the
devil
out
of
his
they
were
pleasant
hours
with
eileen
and
when
she
went
away
from
charing
cross
one
morning
with
small
five
hospital
nurses
and
two
americans
of
the
red
cross
i
wished
with
all
my
heart
that
wickham
brand
had
asked
her
and
not
elsa
von
kreuzenach
to
be
his
wife
that
was
an
idle
wish
for
the
next
morning
brand
and
i
crossed
over
to
france
and
on
the
way
to
paris
my
friend
told
me
that
the
thought
of
meeting
elsa
after
those
months
of
separation
excited
him
so
that
each
minute
seemed
an
hour
and
as
he
told
me
that
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
i
saw
that
his
hand
was
trembling
because
of
this
nervous
strain
vi
we
met
elsa
at
the
gare
de
in
paris
the
evening
after
our
arrival
nervous
anxiety
had
increased
as
the
hour
drew
near
and
he
smoked
cigarette
after
cigarette
while
he
paced
up
and
down
the
as
far
as
he
could
for
the
crowds
which
surged
there
once
he
spoke
to
me
about
his
apprehensions
hope
to
god
this
will
work
out
all
right
only
thinking
of
her
another
time
he
said
french
crowd
would
tear
her
to
pieces
if
they
knew
she
was
while
we
were
waiting
we
met
a
friend
of
old
times
i
was
first
to
recognise
pierre
nesle
who
had
been
attached
to
us
as
interpreter
and
officer
he
was
in
civil
clothes
and
was
wearing
a
bowler
hat
and
a
light
overcoat
so
that
his
transformation
was
astonishing
i
touched
him
on
the
arm
as
he
made
his
way
quickly
through
the
crowd
and
he
turned
sharply
and
stared
at
me
as
though
he
could
not
place
me
at
all
then
a
look
of
recognition
leapt
into
his
eyes
and
he
grasped
both
my
hands
delightedly
he
was
still
thin
and
pale
but
some
of
his
old
melancholy
had
gone
out
of
his
eyes
and
in
its
place
there
was
an
eager
purposeful
look
brand
i
said
be
glad
to
see
you
chance
exclaimed
pierre
and
he
made
a
dash
for
his
friend
and
before
brand
could
remonstrate
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
they
had
been
good
comrades
and
after
the
rescue
of
marthe
from
the
mob
in
lille
it
was
to
brand
that
pierre
nesle
had
opened
his
heart
and
revealed
his
agony
he
could
not
stay
long
with
us
in
the
station
as
he
was
going
to
some
political
meeting
and
perhaps
it
was
well
because
brand
was
naturally
anxious
to
escape
from
him
before
elsa
came
am
working
hard
speaking
writing
organising
on
behalf
of
the
des
said
pierre
must
come
and
see
me
at
my
office
the
headquarters
of
the
new
movement
in
france
to
fulfil
the
ideals
of
the
men
who
fought
to
end
going
to
fight
against
heavy
odds
said
brand
love
you
nor
those
who
like
his
pierre
laughed
and
used
an
old
watchword
of
the
war
les
aurons
those
old
belong
to
the
past
peace
has
still
to
be
made
by
the
men
who
fought
for
a
new
he
gave
us
his
address
pledged
us
to
call
on
him
and
slipped
into
the
vortex
of
the
crowd
brand
and
i
waited
another
twenty
minutes
and
then
in
a
tide
of
new
arrivals
we
saw
elsa
she
was
in
the
company
of
major
quin
friend
who
had
brought
her
from
cologne
a
tall
irishman
who
stooped
a
little
as
he
gave
his
arm
to
the
girl
she
was
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
and
skirt
very
neatly
and
it
was
the
glitter
of
her
hair
that
made
me
catch
sight
of
her
quickly
in
the
crowd
her
eyes
had
a
frightened
look
as
she
came
forward
and
she
was
white
to
the
lips
thinner
too
than
when
i
had
seen
her
last
so
that
she
looked
older
and
not
perhaps
quite
so
wonderfully
pretty
but
her
face
lighted
up
with
intense
gladness
when
brand
stood
in
front
of
her
and
then
under
an
electric
lamp
with
a
crowd
surging
around
him
took
her
in
his
arms
major
quin
and
i
stood
aloof
chatting
together
journey
i
asked
but
glad
over
that
little
lady
is
too
unmistakably
german
everybody
spotted
her
and
looked
unutterable
things
she
was
frightened
and
i
wonder
most
of
them
thought
the
worst
of
me
i
had
to
threaten
one
fellow
with
a
damned
good
hiding
for
an
impertinent
remark
i
brand
thanked
him
for
looking
after
his
wife
and
elsa
gave
him
her
hand
and
said
major
quin
raised
his
finger
and
said
forget
in
paris
then
he
saluted
with
a
click
of
spurs
and
took
his
leave
i
put
brand
and
his
wife
in
a
taxi
and
drove
outside
by
the
driver
to
a
quiet
old
hotel
in
the
rue
honoré
where
we
had
booked
rooms
when
we
registered
the
manager
at
the
desk
stared
at
elsa
curiously
she
spoke
english
but
with
an
unmistakable
accent
the
courtesy
to
brand
which
had
been
perfect
fell
from
him
abruptly
and
he
spoke
with
icy
insolence
when
he
summoned
one
of
the
boys
to
take
up
the
baggage
in
the
that
night
all
eyes
turned
to
elsa
and
brand
with
inquisitive
hostile
looks
i
suppose
her
frock
simple
and
ordinary
as
it
seemed
to
me
proclaimed
its
german
fashion
or
perhaps
her
face
and
hair
were
not
so
english
as
i
had
imagined
it
was
a
little
while
before
the
girl
herself
was
aware
of
those
unpleasant
glances
about
her
she
was
very
happy
sitting
next
to
brand
whose
hand
she
caressed
once
or
twice
and
into
whose
face
she
looked
with
adoration
she
was
still
very
pale
and
i
could
see
that
she
was
immensely
tired
after
her
journey
but
her
eyes
shone
wonderfully
sometimes
she
looked
about
her
and
encountered
the
stares
of
people
elderly
french
and
some
english
nurses
and
a
few
french
officers
dining
at
other
tables
in
the
great
room
with
gilt
mirrors
and
painted
ceiling
she
spoke
to
brand
presently
in
a
low
voice
am
afraid
these
people
stare
at
me
so
much
they
guess
what
i
only
your
fancy
said
brand
they
would
be
fools
not
to
stare
at
a
face
like
she
smiled
and
coloured
up
at
that
sweet
flattery
know
when
people
like
looks
it
is
not
for
that
reason
they
them
said
brand
me
about
franz
and
frau
von
it
was
unwise
of
him
to
sprinkle
his
conversation
with
german
names
the
waiter
at
our
table
was
listening
attentively
presently
i
saw
him
whispering
behind
the
screen
to
one
of
his
comrades
and
looking
our
way
sullenly
he
kept
us
waiting
an
unconscionable
time
for
coffee
and
when
at
last
brand
gave
his
arm
to
elsa
and
led
her
from
the
room
he
gave
a
harsh
laugh
as
they
passed
and
i
heard
the
words
boche
spoken
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
yet
loud
enough
for
all
the
room
to
hear
from
all
the
little
tables
there
came
titters
of
laughter
and
those
words
boche
were
repeated
by
several
voices
i
hoped
that
elsa
and
brand
had
not
heard
but
i
saw
elsa
sway
a
little
on
her
arm
as
though
struck
by
an
invisible
blow
and
brand
turned
with
a
look
of
passion
as
though
he
would
hit
the
waiter
or
challenge
the
whole
room
to
warfare
but
elsa
whispered
to
him
and
he
went
with
her
up
the
staircase
to
their
rooms
the
next
morning
when
i
met
them
at
breakfast
elsa
still
looked
desperately
tired
though
very
happy
and
brand
had
lost
a
little
of
his
haggard
look
and
his
nerve
was
steadier
but
it
was
an
uncomfortable
moment
for
all
of
us
when
the
manager
came
to
the
table
and
regretted
with
icy
courtesy
that
their
rooms
would
not
be
available
another
night
owing
to
a
previous
arrangement
which
he
had
unfortunately
overlooked
said
brand
shortly
have
taken
these
rooms
for
three
nights
and
i
intend
to
stay
in
is
impossible
said
the
manager
must
ask
you
to
have
your
baggage
packed
by
twelve
brand
dealt
with
him
firmly
am
an
english
officer
if
i
hear
another
word
from
you
i
will
call
on
the
provost
marshal
and
get
him
to
deal
with
the
manager
bowed
this
threat
cowed
him
and
he
said
no
more
about
a
change
of
rooms
but
brand
and
his
wife
and
i
as
their
friend
suffered
from
a
policy
of
passive
resistance
to
our
presence
the
chambermaid
did
not
answer
their
bell
having
become
strangely
deaf
the
waiter
was
generally
engaged
at
other
tables
whenever
we
wanted
him
the
hall
porter
turned
his
back
upon
us
the
made
grimaces
behind
our
backs
as
i
saw
very
well
in
the
gilt
mirror
and
as
elsa
saw
they
took
to
having
their
meals
out
brand
insisting
always
that
i
should
join
them
and
we
drove
out
to
the
bois
and
had
tea
there
in
the
des
it
was
a
beautiful
afternoon
in
september
and
the
leaves
were
just
turning
to
crinkled
gold
and
the
lake
was
as
blue
as
the
cloudless
sky
above
across
the
ferry
came
boatloads
of
young
frenchmen
with
their
girls
singing
laughing
on
this
day
of
peace
some
of
the
men
limped
as
they
came
up
the
steps
from
the
one
walked
on
crutches
another
had
an
empty
sleeve
under
the
trees
they
made
love
to
their
girls
and
fed
them
with
ices
people
are
happy
said
elsa
have
forgotten
already
the
agony
of
war
victory
is
healing
in
germany
there
is
only
a
little
later
she
talked
about
the
peace
only
the
had
been
more
generous
in
victory
our
despair
would
not
be
so
great
many
of
us
great
multitudes
believed
that
the
price
of
defeat
would
be
worth
paying
because
germany
would
take
a
place
among
free
nations
and
share
in
the
creation
of
a
nobler
world
now
we
are
crushed
by
the
militarism
of
nations
who
have
used
our
downfall
to
increase
their
own
power
the
light
of
a
new
ideal
which
rose
above
the
darkness
has
gone
brand
took
his
hand
and
stroked
it
in
his
big
paw
this
is
temporary
and
the
work
of
the
old
men
steeped
in
the
old
traditions
which
led
to
war
we
must
wait
for
them
to
die
then
out
of
the
agony
of
the
boyhood
will
come
the
new
elsa
clasped
her
hands
and
leaned
forward
looking
across
the
lake
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
would
like
to
live
long
enough
to
be
sure
of
that
she
said
eagerly
we
have
children
my
husband
perhaps
they
will
listen
to
our
tales
of
the
war
as
franz
and
i
read
about
wolves
and
goblins
in
our
the
fearfulness
of
them
was
not
frightening
for
we
knew
we
were
grant
that
said
brand
gravely
i
am
afraid
said
elsa
she
looked
again
across
the
lake
so
blue
under
the
sky
so
golden
in
sunlight
and
shivered
a
little
are
cold
said
brand
he
put
his
arms
about
her
as
they
sat
side
by
side
and
her
head
drooped
upon
his
shoulder
and
she
closed
her
eyes
like
a
tired
child
they
went
to
the
opera
that
night
and
i
refused
their
invitation
to
join
them
protesting
that
they
would
never
learn
to
know
each
other
if
a
third
person
were
always
present
i
slipped
away
to
see
pierre
nesle
and
found
him
at
an
office
in
a
street
somewhere
off
the
rue
du
louvre
which
was
filled
with
young
men
whose
faces
i
seemed
to
have
seen
before
under
blue
shrapnel
helmets
above
blue
tunics
they
were
typewriting
as
though
serving
and
folding
up
papers
while
they
whistled
the
tune
of
pierre
was
in
his
shirtsleeves
dictating
letters
to
a
in
civil
clothes
activity
on
the
western
front
eh
he
said
when
he
saw
me
me
all
about
it
he
told
me
something
about
it
in
a
restaurant
where
we
dined
in
the
rue
du
marché
honoré
he
was
one
of
the
organising
secretaries
of
a
society
made
up
exclusively
of
young
soldiers
who
had
fought
in
the
trenches
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
intellectuals
among
them
painters
poets
novelists
journalists
but
the
main
body
were
simple
soldiers
animated
by
one
idea
to
prevent
another
war
by
substituting
the
and
brotherhood
of
peoples
for
the
old
diplomacy
of
secret
alliances
and
the
old
tradition
of
powerful
armies
about
the
peace
treaty
and
the
league
of
nations
i
asked
pierre
nesle
shrugged
his
shoulders
contemptuously
peace
treaty
belongs
to
the
napoleonic
tradition
got
beyond
that
now
it
is
the
programme
that
has
carefully
arranged
another
and
inevitable
war
look
at
the
world
now
look
at
france
italy
germany
austria
we
are
all
ruined
together
and
those
most
ruined
will
by
their
disease
and
death
drag
down
europe
into
general
misery
what
has
victory
given
to
france
a
great
belt
of
devastated
country
cemeteries
crowded
with
dead
youth
bankruptcy
and
everything
five
times
the
cost
of
rates
another
such
victory
will
wipe
us
off
the
map
we
have
smashed
germany
it
is
true
for
a
time
we
have
punished
her
women
and
children
for
the
crimes
of
their
war
lords
but
can
we
keep
her
crushed
are
our
frontiers
impregnable
against
the
time
when
her
people
come
back
for
revenge
smashing
the
fetters
we
have
placed
on
them
and
rising
again
in
strength
for
ten
years
for
twenty
years
for
thirty
years
perhaps
we
shall
be
safe
and
after
that
if
the
heart
of
europe
does
not
change
if
we
do
not
learn
wisdom
from
the
horror
that
has
passed
france
will
be
ravaged
again
and
all
that
we
have
seen
our
children
will
see
and
their
suffering
will
be
greater
than
ours
and
they
will
not
have
the
hope
we
he
stared
back
into
the
past
not
a
very
distant
past
and
i
fancy
that
among
the
figures
he
saw
was
marthe
his
sister
the
remedy
i
asked
union
of
democracy
across
the
frontiers
of
hate
he
answered
and
i
think
it
was
a
phrase
that
he
had
written
and
learnt
by
heart
fine
phrase
i
said
laughing
a
little
he
flared
up
at
me
more
than
a
phrase
the
of
millions
in
france
i
asked
pointedly
the
france
of
clemenceau
than
you
imagine
he
answered
boldly
our
present
chauvinism
our
natural
exultation
in
victory
our
inevitable
hatred
of
the
enemy
is
at
work
and
an
idealism
higher
than
that
at
present
its
voice
is
not
heard
the
old
men
are
having
their
day
presently
the
new
men
will
arrive
with
the
new
ideas
they
are
here
but
do
not
speak
old
men
again
i
said
is
strange
in
germany
in
france
in
england
even
in
america
people
are
talking
strangely
about
the
old
men
as
though
they
were
guilty
of
all
this
agony
that
is
were
guilty
said
pierre
nesle
is
against
the
old
men
in
all
countries
of
europe
that
youth
will
declare
war
for
it
was
their
ideas
which
brought
us
to
our
he
spoke
so
loudly
that
people
in
the
restaurant
turned
to
look
at
him
he
paid
his
bill
and
spoke
in
a
lower
voice
is
dangerous
to
talk
like
this
in
public
let
us
walk
up
the
champs
elysées
where
i
am
visiting
some
suddenly
a
remembrance
came
back
to
him
friends
too
he
said
friends
yes
madame
chéri
and
hélène
after
death
they
could
not
bear
to
live
in
that
poor
boy
who
came
back
he
is
dead
was
broken
by
the
prison
life
said
pierre
died
within
a
month
of
armistice
and
hélène
wept
her
heart
out
he
confided
a
secret
to
me
hélène
and
he
had
come
to
love
each
other
and
would
marry
when
they
could
get
her
consent
or
one
day
if
her
objection
i
asked
splendid
to
think
that
hélène
and
you
will
be
man
and
wife
the
thought
of
it
makes
me
feel
he
pressed
my
arm
and
said
mille
fois
mon
madame
chéri
objected
to
his
political
opinions
she
regarded
them
as
poisonous
treachery
hélène
i
remembered
that
outburst
months
back
when
hélène
had
desired
the
death
of
many
german
babies
loves
me
said
pierre
simply
do
not
talk
on
our
way
to
the
avenue
victor
hugo
i
ventured
to
ask
him
a
question
which
had
been
a
long
time
in
my
mind
sister
marthe
she
is
well
even
in
the
pearly
twilight
of
the
champs
elysées
i
was
aware
of
sudden
change
of
colour
i
had
touched
a
nerve
that
still
jumped
is
well
and
happy
he
answered
gravely
is
now
a
a
nun
in
the
convent
at
lille
they
tell
me
she
is
a
saint
her
name
in
religion
is
i
called
on
madame
chéri
and
her
daughter
with
pierre
nesle
they
seemed
delighted
to
see
me
and
hélène
greeted
me
like
an
old
and
trusted
friend
giving
me
the
privilege
of
kissing
her
cheek
she
had
grown
taller
and
beautiful
and
there
was
a
softness
in
her
eyes
when
she
looked
at
pierre
which
made
me
sure
of
his
splendid
luck
madame
chéri
had
aged
and
some
of
her
fire
had
burnt
out
i
guessed
that
it
was
due
to
death
she
spoke
of
that
and
wept
a
little
and
deplored
the
mildness
of
the
peace
treaty
which
had
not
punished
the
evil
race
who
had
killed
her
husband
and
her
boy
and
the
flower
of
france
are
many
german
dead
said
pierre
have
been
enough
cried
madame
chéri
should
all
be
hélène
kissed
her
hand
and
snuggled
down
to
her
as
once
i
had
seen
in
lille
she
said
us
talk
of
happy
things
pierre
has
brought
us
a
good
later
in
the
evening
when
pierre
and
hélène
had
gone
into
another
room
to
find
some
biscuits
for
our
wine
madame
chéri
spoke
to
me
about
their
betrothal
is
full
of
strange
and
terrible
ideas
she
said
are
shared
by
other
young
men
who
fought
bravely
for
france
to
me
they
seem
wicked
and
the
talk
of
cowards
except
that
their
medals
tell
of
courage
but
the
light
in
eyes
weakens
me
too
much
of
a
frenchwoman
to
be
stern
with
by
those
words
of
hers
i
was
able
to
give
pierre
a
message
of
when
he
walked
back
with
me
that
night
and
he
went
away
with
gladness
with
gladness
also
did
elsa
brand
set
out
next
day
for
england
where
as
a
girl
she
had
known
happy
days
and
where
now
her
dream
lived
with
the
man
who
stood
beside
her
together
we
watched
for
the
white
cliffs
and
when
suddenly
the
sun
glinted
on
them
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
putting
her
hand
through
arm
said
home
vii
i
saw
very
little
of
brand
in
london
after
arrival
in
his
house
at
chelsea
i
was
busy
as
usual
watching
the
way
of
the
world
and
putting
my
nose
down
to
bits
of
blank
paper
which
i
proceeded
to
spoil
with
futile
words
brand
was
doing
the
same
thing
in
his
study
on
the
top
floor
of
the
house
in
cheyne
walk
while
elsa
in
true
german
style
was
working
embroidery
or
reading
english
literature
to
improve
her
mind
and
her
knowledge
of
the
language
brand
was
endeavouring
strenuously
to
earn
money
enough
to
make
him
free
of
his
house
he
failed
on
the
whole
rather
miserably
he
began
a
novel
on
the
war
became
excited
with
it
for
the
first
six
chapters
then
stuck
hopelessly
and
abandoned
it
find
it
impossible
he
wrote
to
me
get
the
real
thing
into
my
narrative
it
is
all
wooden
unnatural
and
wrong
i
get
the
right
perspective
on
paper
although
i
think
i
see
it
clear
enough
when
not
writing
the
thing
is
too
enormous
the
psychology
too
complicated
for
my
power
of
expression
a
thousand
characters
four
years
of
experience
come
crowding
into
my
mind
and
i
eliminate
the
unessential
and
stick
the
point
of
my
pen
into
the
heart
of
truth
besides
the
present
state
of
the
world
to
say
nothing
of
domestic
trouble
prevents
anything
like
concentration
and
my
nerves
have
gone
to
after
the
abandonment
of
his
novel
he
took
to
writing
articles
for
magazines
and
newspapers
some
of
which
appeared
thereby
producing
some
useful
guineas
i
read
them
and
liked
their
strength
of
style
and
intensity
of
emotion
but
they
were
profoundly
pessimistic
and
gloomy
dean
who
was
prophesying
woe
had
an
able
seconder
in
wickham
brand
who
foresaw
the
ruin
of
civilisation
and
the
downfall
of
the
british
empire
because
of
the
stupidity
of
the
leaders
and
the
careless
ignorance
of
the
multitudes
he
harped
too
much
on
the
same
string
and
i
fancied
that
editors
would
soon
begin
to
tire
of
his
melancholy
tune
i
was
right
have
had
six
articles
rejected
in
three
weeks
wrote
brand
want
the
truth
they
want
cheery
insincerity
well
they
get
it
from
me
though
i
starve
to
death
but
hard
on
elsa
having
a
horrible
time
and
her
nerve
is
breaking
i
wish
to
god
i
could
afford
to
take
her
down
to
the
country
somewhere
away
from
spiteful
females
and
their
cunning
cruelty
have
you
seen
any
christian
charity
about
in
this
most
christian
country
if
so
send
me
word
and
walk
to
it
on
my
knees
from
it
was
in
a
postscript
to
a
letter
about
a
short
story
he
was
writing
that
he
wrote
an
alarming
sentence
think
elsa
is
dying
she
gets
weaker
every
those
words
sent
me
to
chelsea
in
a
hurry
i
had
been
too
careless
of
troubles
owing
to
my
own
pressure
of
work
and
my
own
fight
with
a
nervous
depression
which
was
a
general
malady
i
found
with
most
men
back
from
the
war
when
i
rapped
the
brass
knocker
on
the
house
in
cheyne
walk
the
door
was
opened
by
a
different
maid
from
the
one
i
had
seen
on
my
first
visit
there
the
other
one
as
brand
told
me
afterwards
had
given
notice
because
abide
them
meaning
elsa
and
with
her
had
gone
the
cook
who
had
been
with
mother
for
twenty
years
brand
was
writing
in
his
study
upstairs
when
the
new
maid
showed
me
in
or
rather
he
was
leaning
over
a
with
his
elbows
dug
into
the
table
and
his
face
in
his
hands
while
an
unlighted
pipe
his
old
trench
pipe
lay
across
the
inkpot
out
a
new
plot
old
man
i
asked
cheerily
come
he
said
own
plot
cuts
across
my
line
of
elsa
he
pointed
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
to
the
door
leading
from
his
room
i
hope
sit
down
and
have
a
we
talked
about
things
in
general
for
a
time
they
were
not
very
cheerful
anyhow
brand
and
i
were
both
gloomy
souls
just
then
and
knew
each
other
too
well
to
camouflage
our
views
about
the
state
of
europe
and
the
as
it
was
called
in
england
then
he
told
me
about
elsa
and
it
was
a
tragic
tale
from
the
very
first
his
people
had
treated
her
with
a
studied
unkindness
which
had
broken
her
nerve
and
spirit
she
had
come
to
england
with
a
joyous
hope
of
finding
happiness
and
friendship
with
her
family
and
glad
to
escape
from
the
sadness
of
germany
and
the
solemn
disapproval
of
her
own
people
apart
from
franz
who
was
devoted
to
her
her
first
dismay
came
when
she
kissed
the
hand
of
her
who
drew
it
away
as
though
she
had
been
stung
by
a
wasp
and
when
her
movement
to
kiss
her
sister
ethel
was
repulsed
by
a
girl
who
drew
back
icily
and
said
do
you
do
even
then
she
comforted
herself
a
little
with
the
thought
that
this
coldness
was
due
to
english
reserve
and
that
in
a
little
while
english
kindness
would
be
revealed
but
the
days
passed
with
only
unkindness
at
first
lady
brand
and
her
daughter
maintained
a
chilly
silence
towards
elsa
at
breakfast
luncheon
and
other
meals
talking
to
each
other
brightly
as
though
she
did
not
exist
and
referring
constantly
to
wickham
as
ethel
had
a
habit
of
reading
out
morsels
from
the
penny
illustrated
papers
and
often
they
referred
to
trick
of
the
or
revelations
of
hun
at
these
times
sir
amyas
brand
said
in
a
portentous
voice
but
privately
with
some
consciousness
of
decency
begged
ethel
to
desist
from
she
in
the
presence
of
her
brother
whose
violence
of
speech
scared
her
into
silence
a
later
phase
of
hostility
to
elsa
was
in
the
style
of
amiable
enquiry
in
a
simple
childlike
way
as
though
eager
for
knowledge
she
would
ask
elsa
such
questions
as
the
germans
boiled
down
their
dead
they
crucified
canadian
prisoners
it
true
that
german
school
children
sang
the
hymn
of
hate
before
morning
lessons
it
by
order
of
the
kaiser
that
english
prisoners
were
starved
to
death
elsa
answered
all
these
questions
by
passionate
denials
it
was
a
terrible
falsehood
she
said
that
the
germans
had
boiled
down
bodies
for
fats
on
the
contrary
they
paid
the
greatest
reverence
to
their
dead
as
her
brother
had
seen
in
many
cemeteries
on
the
western
front
the
story
of
the
had
been
disproved
by
the
english
intelligence
officers
after
a
special
enquiry
as
wickham
had
told
her
she
had
never
heard
the
hymn
of
hate
some
of
the
english
prisoners
had
been
harshly
treated
there
were
brutal
commandants
but
not
deliberately
starved
not
starved
more
than
german
soldiers
who
had
very
little
food
during
the
last
years
of
the
war
surely
said
lady
brand
must
admit
my
dear
that
germany
conducted
this
war
with
the
greatest
possible
barbarity
otherwise
why
should
the
world
call
them
huns
elsa
said
it
was
only
the
english
who
called
the
germans
huns
and
that
was
for
a
propaganda
of
hatred
which
was
very
wicked
look
like
a
hun
she
asked
and
then
burst
into
tears
lady
brand
was
disconcerted
by
that
sign
of
weakness
think
us
unkind
elsa
but
of
course
we
have
to
uphold
the
ethel
was
utterly
unmoved
by
tears
and
indeed
found
a
holy
satisfaction
in
them
the
german
people
confess
their
guilt
with
weeping
and
lamentation
the
english
will
be
first
to
forgive
never
till
the
presence
of
a
german
girl
in
the
house
seemed
to
act
as
a
blight
upon
all
domestic
happiness
it
was
the
cook
who
first
elsa
had
never
so
much
as
set
eyes
upon
that
woman
who
had
prepared
the
family
food
since
wickham
had
sat
in
a
high
chair
with
a
bib
round
his
neck
but
mary
in
a
private
interview
with
lady
brand
stormy
in
its
character
as
elsa
could
hear
through
the
folding
doors
vowed
that
she
would
not
live
in
the
same
house
with
of
those
damned
lady
tearful
protestations
that
elsa
was
no
longer
german
being
wife
and
that
she
had
repented
sincerely
of
all
the
wrong
done
by
the
country
in
which
she
had
unfortunately
been
born
did
not
weaken
the
resolution
of
mary
grubb
whose
patriotism
had
always
been
suspicion
as
she
said
hope
to
remain
she
went
next
morning
after
a
great
noise
of
breathing
and
the
descent
of
tin
boxes
while
lady
brand
and
ethel
looked
with
reproachful
eyes
at
elsa
as
the
cause
of
this
irreparable
blow
the
followed
in
a
time
on
the
advice
of
her
young
man
who
had
worked
in
a
canteen
of
the
at
boulogne
and
knew
all
about
german
spies
it
was
very
awkward
for
lady
brand
who
assumed
an
expression
of
christian
martyrdom
and
told
wickham
that
his
rash
act
was
bearing
sad
fruit
a
mixed
metaphor
which
increased
his
anger
as
he
told
me
to
a
ridiculous
degree
he
could
see
that
elsa
was
very
miserable
many
times
she
wept
when
alone
with
him
and
begged
him
to
take
her
away
to
a
little
home
of
their
own
even
if
it
were
only
one
room
in
the
poorest
neighbourhood
but
wickham
was
almost
penniless
and
begged
her
to
be
patient
a
little
longer
until
he
had
saved
enough
to
fulfil
their
hope
there
i
think
he
was
unwise
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
to
borrow
money
he
had
good
friends
rather
than
keep
his
wife
in
such
a
hostile
atmosphere
she
was
weak
and
ill
he
was
alarmed
at
her
increasing
weakness
once
she
fainted
in
his
arms
and
even
to
go
upstairs
to
their
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
house
tired
her
so
much
that
afterwards
she
would
lie
back
in
a
chair
with
her
eyes
closed
looking
very
white
and
worn
she
tried
to
hide
her
from
her
husband
and
when
they
were
alone
together
she
seemed
gay
and
happy
and
would
have
deceived
him
but
for
those
fits
of
weeping
at
the
unkindness
of
his
mother
and
sister
and
those
sudden
attacks
of
when
all
physical
strength
departed
from
her
her
love
for
him
seemed
to
grow
with
the
weakness
of
her
body
she
could
not
bear
him
to
leave
her
alone
for
any
length
of
time
and
while
he
was
writing
sat
near
him
so
that
she
might
have
her
head
against
his
shoulder
or
touch
his
hand
or
kiss
it
it
was
not
conducive
to
easy
writing
or
the
invention
of
plots
something
like
a
crisis
happened
after
a
painful
scene
in
the
downstairs
on
a
day
when
brand
had
gone
out
to
walk
off
a
sense
of
deadly
depression
which
prevented
all
literary
effort
several
ladies
had
come
to
tea
with
lady
brand
and
ethel
and
they
gazed
at
elsa
as
though
she
were
a
strange
and
dangerous
animal
one
of
them
a
thin
and
elderly
schoolmistress
elsa
as
to
her
nationality
suppose
you
are
swedish
my
dear
she
said
sweetly
said
elsa
then
no
doubt
continued
miss
clutter
am
german
said
elsa
that
announcement
had
caused
consternation
among
lady
guests
two
of
the
ladies
departed
almost
immediately
the
others
stayed
to
see
how
miss
clutter
would
deal
with
this
amazing
situation
she
dealt
with
it
firmly
and
with
the
cold
intelligence
of
a
high
schoolmistress
interesting
she
said
turning
to
lady
brand
your
will
enlighten
us
a
little
about
german
psychology
which
we
have
found
so
puzzling
i
should
be
so
glad
if
she
could
explain
to
us
how
the
german
people
reconcile
the
sinking
of
merchant
ships
the
unspeakable
crime
of
the
with
any
belief
in
god
or
even
with
the
principles
of
our
common
humanity
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
how
the
drowning
of
babies
could
be
regarded
as
legitimate
warfare
by
a
people
proud
of
their
it
would
be
better
to
avoid
controversy
dear
miss
clutter
said
lady
brand
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
an
scene
which
would
be
described
in
other
next
day
but
miss
clutter
had
adopted
method
of
enquiry
she
so
much
wanted
to
know
the
german
point
of
view
certainly
they
must
have
a
point
of
view
it
would
be
so
interesting
to
know
said
another
lady
if
we
could
believe
it
said
another
elsa
had
been
twisting
and
a
little
lace
handkerchief
in
her
lap
she
was
very
pale
and
tried
to
conceal
a
painful
agitation
from
all
these
hostile
and
enquiring
ladies
then
she
spoke
to
them
in
a
low
strained
voice
will
never
understand
she
said
look
out
from
england
with
eyes
of
hate
and
without
pity
in
your
hearts
the
submarine
warfare
was
shameful
there
were
little
children
drowned
on
the
and
women
i
wept
for
them
and
prayed
the
dear
god
to
stop
the
war
did
you
weep
for
our
little
children
and
our
women
they
too
were
killed
by
sea
warfare
not
only
a
few
as
on
the
but
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
your
blockade
closed
us
in
with
an
iron
ring
no
ship
could
bring
us
food
for
two
years
we
starved
on
short
rations
and
chemical
foods
we
were
without
fats
and
milk
our
mothers
watched
their
children
weaken
and
wither
and
die
because
of
the
english
blockade
their
own
milk
dried
up
within
their
breasts
little
coffins
were
carried
down
our
streets
day
after
day
week
after
week
fathers
and
mothers
were
mad
at
the
loss
of
their
little
ones
must
smash
our
way
through
the
english
blockade
they
said
the
warfare
gladdened
them
it
seemed
a
chance
of
rescue
for
the
children
of
germany
it
was
wicked
but
all
the
war
was
wickedness
it
was
wicked
of
you
english
to
keep
up
your
blockade
so
long
after
armistice
so
that
more
children
died
and
more
women
were
consumptive
and
men
fainted
at
their
work
do
you
reconcile
that
with
good
love
oh
i
find
more
hatred
here
in
england
than
i
knew
even
in
germany
it
is
cruel
unforgiving
unfair
you
are
proud
of
your
own
virtue
and
hypocritical
god
will
be
kinder
to
my
people
than
to
you
because
now
we
cry
out
for
his
mercy
and
you
are
still
arrogant
with
the
name
of
god
on
your
lips
but
a
devil
of
pride
in
your
hearts
i
came
here
with
my
dear
husband
believing
that
many
english
would
be
like
him
forgiving
hating
cruelty
eager
to
heal
the
broken
heart
you
are
not
like
him
you
are
cruel
and
lovers
of
cruelty
even
to
one
poor
german
girl
who
came
to
you
for
shelter
with
her
english
man
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
pity
you
because
of
your
narrowness
i
do
not
want
to
know
she
stood
up
swaying
a
little
with
one
hand
on
the
mantelpiece
as
afterwards
she
told
her
husband
she
did
not
believe
that
she
could
cross
the
floor
without
falling
there
was
a
strange
dizziness
in
her
head
and
a
mist
before
her
eyes
but
she
held
her
head
high
and
walked
out
of
the
and
then
upstairs
when
wickham
brand
came
back
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
very
ill
he
sent
for
a
doctor
who
was
with
her
for
is
very
weak
he
said
pulse
to
speak
of
you
will
have
to
be
careful
of
her
deuced
he
gave
no
name
to
her
illness
weakness
he
said
down
like
a
clock
nerves
all
wrong
and
no
he
sent
round
a
tonic
which
elsa
took
like
a
child
and
for
a
little
while
it
seemed
to
do
her
good
but
brand
was
frightened
because
her
weakness
had
come
back
i
am
glad
now
that
i
had
an
idea
which
helped
brand
in
this
time
of
trouble
and
gave
elsa
some
weeks
of
happiness
and
peace
it
occurred
to
me
that
young
harding
was
living
alone
in
his
big
old
country
house
near
weybridge
and
would
be
glad
and
grateful
because
of
his
loneliness
to
give
to
brand
and
his
wife
he
had
a
great
liking
for
brand
as
most
of
us
had
and
his
hatred
of
germany
had
not
been
so
violent
since
his
days
in
cologne
his
good
nature
anyhow
and
the
fine
courtesy
which
was
the
essential
quality
of
his
character
would
make
him
kind
to
elsa
so
ill
and
so
desperately
in
need
of
kindness
i
was
not
disappointed
when
i
spoke
to
him
over
the
telephone
he
said
will
be
splendid
for
me
this
lonely
house
is
getting
on
my
nerves
badly
bring
them
i
took
them
down
in
a
car
two
days
later
it
was
a
fine
autumn
day
with
a
sparkle
in
the
air
and
a
touch
of
frost
on
the
hedgerows
elsa
wrapped
up
in
heavy
rugs
lay
back
next
to
brand
and
a
little
colour
crept
back
into
her
cheeks
and
brought
back
her
beauty
i
think
a
shadow
lifted
from
her
as
she
drove
away
from
that
house
in
chelsea
where
she
had
dwelt
with
enmity
among
her
people
house
in
surrey
was
at
the
end
of
a
fine
avenue
of
beeches
glorious
in
their
autumn
foliage
of
crinkled
gold
a
rabbit
scuttled
across
the
drive
as
we
came
and
bobbed
beneath
the
red
bracken
of
the
undergrowth
said
elsa
like
a
child
is
peterkin
what
a
rogue
he
looks
her
eyes
were
bright
when
she
caught
sight
of
house
in
the
elizabethan
style
of
splashed
with
scarlet
where
the
virginia
creeper
straggled
on
its
walls
is
wonderfully
english
she
said
franz
would
love
this
place
harding
came
down
from
the
steps
to
greet
us
and
i
thought
it
noble
of
him
that
he
should
kiss
the
hand
when
brand
said
is
for
harding
had
been
a
you
remember
his
phrase
good
german
but
a
dead
german
and
that
little
act
was
real
chivalry
to
a
woman
of
the
enemy
there
was
a
great
fire
of
logs
burning
in
the
open
hearth
in
the
hall
flinging
a
ruddy
glare
on
the
panelled
walls
and
glinting
on
bits
of
armour
and
hunting
trophies
upstairs
also
brand
told
me
there
was
a
splendid
fire
in
room
which
had
once
been
the
room
of
wife
it
wanned
elsa
not
only
in
body
but
in
soul
here
was
an
english
welcome
and
kindness
of
thought
on
her
there
were
flowers
from
and
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
them
for
there
had
been
no
flowers
in
cheyne
walk
chelsea
that
night
she
was
strong
enough
to
come
down
to
dinner
and
looked
very
charming
there
at
the
polished
board
fit
only
by
candlelight
whose
soft
rays
touched
the
gold
of
her
hair
is
a
true
english
home
she
said
glancing
up
at
the
panelled
walls
and
at
portraits
of
people
in
costumes
which
hung
there
lonely
one
when
no
friends
are
here
said
harding
and
that
was
the
only
time
he
referred
in
any
way
to
the
wife
who
had
left
him
that
dinner
was
the
last
one
which
elsa
had
sitting
at
table
with
us
she
became
very
tired
again
so
tired
that
brand
had
to
carry
her
upstairs
and
downstairs
which
he
did
as
though
she
weighed
no
more
than
a
child
during
the
day
she
lay
on
a
sofa
in
the
and
brand
did
no
writing
now
nor
any
kind
of
work
but
stayed
always
with
his
wife
for
hours
together
he
sat
by
her
side
and
she
held
his
hand
and
touched
his
face
and
hair
and
was
happy
in
her
love
a
good
friend
came
to
stay
with
them
and
brought
unfailing
cheerfulness
it
was
charles
fortune
who
had
come
down
at
invitation
he
was
as
comical
as
ever
and
made
elsa
laugh
with
ripples
of
merriment
while
he
satirised
the
world
as
he
knew
it
with
shrewd
and
penetrating
wit
he
played
the
jester
industriously
to
get
that
laughter
from
her
though
sometimes
she
had
to
beg
of
him
not
to
make
her
laugh
so
much
because
it
hurt
her
then
he
played
the
piano
late
into
the
afternoon
until
the
twilight
in
the
room
faded
into
darkness
except
for
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
log
fire
or
after
dinner
in
the
evenings
until
brand
carried
his
wife
to
bed
he
played
chopin
best
with
a
magic
touch
but
elsa
liked
him
to
play
bach
and
schumann
and
sometimes
mozart
because
that
brought
back
her
girlhood
in
the
days
before
the
war
so
it
was
one
evening
when
brand
sat
on
a
low
stool
by
the
sofa
on
which
elsa
lay
with
her
fingers
playing
in
his
hair
or
resting
on
his
shoulder
while
fortune
filled
the
room
with
melody
once
or
twice
elsa
spoke
to
brand
in
a
low
voice
i
heard
some
of
her
words
as
i
lay
on
a
bearskin
by
the
fire
am
wonderfully
happy
my
dear
she
said
once
and
brand
pulled
her
hand
down
and
kissed
it
a
little
later
she
spoke
again
is
so
much
better
than
hate
then
why
should
people
go
to
war
knows
my
dear
said
brand
it
was
some
time
after
that
when
fortune
was
playing
softly
that
i
heard
elsa
give
a
big
tired
sigh
and
say
the
word
charles
fortune
played
something
of
now
with
grand
crashing
chords
which
throbbed
through
the
room
as
the
last
glow
of
the
sunset
flushed
through
the
windows
suddenly
brand
stirred
on
his
stool
made
an
abrupt
movement
then
rose
and
gave
a
loud
agonising
cry
fortune
stopped
playing
with
a
slur
of
notes
harding
leapt
up
from
his
chair
in
a
dark
corner
and
said
the
matter
brand
had
dropped
to
his
knees
and
was
weeping
with
his
arms
about
his
dead
wife
viii
i
was
again
a
wanderer
in
the
land
and
going
from
country
to
country
in
europe
saw
the
disillusionment
that
had
followed
victory
and
the
despair
that
had
followed
defeat
and
the
ravages
that
were
bequeathed
by
war
to
peace
not
only
in
devastated
earth
and
stricken
towns
but
in
the
souls
of
men
and
women
the
victors
had
made
great
promises
to
their
people
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
still
unredeemed
they
had
promised
them
rich
fruits
of
victory
to
be
paid
out
of
the
ruin
of
their
enemies
but
little
fruit
of
gold
or
treasure
could
be
gathered
from
the
utter
bankruptcy
of
germany
and
austria
whose
factories
stayed
idle
for
lack
of
raw
material
and
whose
money
was
waste
paper
in
value
of
exchange
was
the
watchword
of
statesmen
uttered
as
a
kind
of
magic
spell
but
when
i
went
over
the
old
battlefields
in
france
i
found
no
sign
of
reconstruction
but
only
the
vast
belt
of
desolation
which
in
war
i
had
seen
swept
by
fire
no
had
built
up
those
towns
and
villages
which
had
been
blown
into
dust
and
ashes
nor
had
given
life
to
riven
trees
and
earth
choked
and
deadened
by
high
explosives
here
and
there
poor
families
had
crept
back
to
the
place
where
their
old
homes
had
stood
grubbing
in
the
ruins
for
some
relic
of
their
former
habitations
and
building
wooden
shanties
in
the
desert
as
frail
shelters
against
the
wind
and
the
rain
in
ypres
the
city
of
great
death
there
were
wooden
for
the
refreshment
of
tourists
who
came
from
paris
to
see
the
graveyard
of
youth
and
girls
sold
where
boys
of
ours
had
gone
marching
up
the
menin
road
under
storms
of
which
took
daily
toll
of
them
no
french
statesman
by
optimistic
words
could
resurrect
in
a
little
while
the
beauty
that
had
been
in
artois
and
picardy
and
the
fields
of
champagne
on
days
of
national
thanksgiving
the
spirit
of
france
was
exalted
by
the
joy
of
victory
in
paris
it
was
a
feverish
joy
with
laughing
ecstasy
with
troops
of
dancing
girls
and
a
carnival
that
broke
all
bounds
between
montmartre
and
montparnasse
france
had
saved
herself
from
death
she
had
revenged
herself
for
and
the
years
just
passed
she
had
crushed
the
enemy
that
had
always
been
a
brutal
menace
across
the
frontier
she
had
her
sword
deep
in
the
heart
of
germany
which
lay
bleeding
at
her
feet
i
who
love
france
with
a
kind
of
passion
and
had
seen
during
the
years
of
war
the
agony
and
the
heroism
of
her
people
did
not
begrudge
them
their
ecstasy
and
it
touched
my
spirit
with
its
fire
so
that
in
france
i
could
see
and
understand
the
french
point
of
view
of
ruthlessness
towards
the
beaten
foe
but
i
saw
also
what
many
people
of
france
saw
slowly
but
with
a
sense
of
fear
that
the
treaty
made
by
clemenceau
did
not
make
them
safe
except
for
a
little
while
this
had
not
been
after
all
war
to
end
there
was
no
guarantee
of
their
frontiers
were
not
made
impregnable
against
the
time
when
the
germans
might
grow
strong
again
and
come
back
for
vengeance
they
could
not
stand
alone
but
must
make
new
alliances
new
secret
treaties
new
armies
new
armaments
because
hate
survived
and
the
league
of
nations
was
a
farce
as
it
had
come
from
the
table
at
versailles
they
looked
round
and
counted
their
cost
a
million
and
a
half
dead
a
multitude
of
maimed
and
blind
and
men
a
that
had
sunk
to
zero
a
staggering
debt
which
they
could
not
pay
a
cost
of
living
which
mounted
higher
and
ever
higher
a
sense
of
revolt
among
the
soldiers
who
had
come
back
because
their
reward
for
four
years
of
misery
was
no
more
than
miserable
so
it
was
in
italy
stricken
by
a
more
desperate
poverty
disappointed
by
a
lack
of
spoil
angry
with
a
sense
of
afraid
of
revolution
exultant
when
a
mad
poet
seized
the
port
of
fiume
which
had
been
denied
to
her
by
president
wilson
and
his
conscience
across
the
glittering
waters
of
the
adriatic
i
went
to
trieste
and
found
it
a
dead
port
with
italian
officers
in
possession
of
its
deserted
docks
and
abandoned
warehouses
and
austrians
dying
of
typhus
in
the
back
streets
and
starving
to
death
in
tenement
houses
and
then
across
the
new
state
of
cut
out
of
the
body
of
the
old
austrian
empire
now
lying
dismembered
i
came
to
vienna
which
once
i
had
known
as
the
gayest
capital
of
europe
where
charming
people
played
the
pleasant
game
of
life
with
music
and
love
and
laughter
in
vienna
there
was
music
still
but
it
played
a
a
dance
of
death
which
struck
one
with
a
sense
of
horror
the
orchestras
still
fiddled
in
the
restaurants
at
night
the
was
crowded
in
bright
with
gilt
and
glass
in
restaurants
rich
in
marble
walls
crowds
of
people
listened
to
the
waltzes
of
strauss
ate
smuggled
food
at
monstrous
prices
laughed
flirted
and
drank
they
were
the
profiteers
of
war
spending
paper
money
with
the
knowledge
that
it
had
no
value
outside
vienna
no
value
here
except
in
stacks
to
buy
warmth
for
their
stomachs
a
little
warmth
for
their
souk
while
their
stock
of
kronen
lasted
they
were
the
vultures
from
and
come
to
feed
on
the
corpse
of
austria
while
it
still
had
flesh
on
its
bones
and
while
austrian
kronen
still
had
some
kind
of
purchase
power
and
outside
two
million
people
were
starving
slowly
but
very
surely
to
death
the
children
were
starving
quickly
to
death
their
coffins
passed
me
in
the
streets
ten
twelve
fifteen
in
one
between
san
chinch
and
the
favoritenstrasse
small
living
skeletons
padded
after
one
with
naked
feet
thrusting
out
little
hands
begging
for
charity
in
the
great
hospital
of
vienna
children
lay
in
crowded
wards
with
twisted
limbs
and
bulbous
heads
diseased
from
birth
because
of
their
hunger
and
a
life
without
milk
and
any
kind
of
fat
vienna
the
capital
of
a
great
empire
had
been
sentenced
to
death
by
the
treaty
of
peace
which
had
so
carved
up
her
former
territory
that
she
was
cut
off
from
all
her
natural
resources
and
from
all
means
of
industry
commerce
and
life
it
was
small
dear
small
who
gave
me
an
intimate
knowledge
of
what
was
happening
in
vienna
a
year
after
armistice
and
it
was
eileen
who
still
further
enlightened
me
by
taking
me
into
the
the
and
the
working
homes
where
disease
and
death
found
their
victims
she
took
me
to
these
places
until
i
sickened
and
said
can
bear
no
small
had
a
small
office
in
the
kârtnerstrasse
where
eileen
worked
with
him
and
it
was
here
that
i
found
them
both
a
day
after
my
arrival
in
vienna
eileen
was
on
her
knees
making
a
wood
fire
and
puffing
it
into
a
blaze
for
the
purpose
of
boiling
a
tin
kettle
which
stood
on
a
trivet
and
after
that
as
i
found
for
making
tea
outside
there
was
a
raw
horrible
day
with
a
white
mist
in
which
those
coffins
were
going
by
and
with
those
barefoot
children
with
pallid
faces
and
gaunt
cheeks
padding
by
side
so
that
i
was
glad
to
see
the
flames
in
the
hearth
and
to
hear
the
cheerful
dink
of
which
the
doctor
was
getting
out
better
still
was
i
glad
to
see
these
two
good
friends
so
sane
so
vital
so
purposeful
as
i
found
them
in
a
world
of
gloom
and
neurosis
the
doctor
told
me
of
their
work
it
was
and
increasing
in
range
of
action
they
had
organised
a
number
of
feeding
centres
in
vienna
and
stores
from
which
mothers
could
buy
condensed
milk
and
cocoa
and
margarine
at
next
to
nothing
for
their
starving
babes
austrian
ladies
were
doing
most
of
the
actual
work
apart
from
organisation
at
headquarters
and
doing
it
devotedly
from
america
and
from
england
money
was
flowing
in
tide
of
thought
is
turning
said
the
doctor
dollar
we
get
and
every
shilling
is
a
proof
that
the
call
of
humanity
is
being
heard
above
the
old
war
every
dollar
and
every
shilling
said
eileen
helping
to
save
the
life
of
some
poor
woman
or
some
little
mite
who
had
no
guilt
in
the
war
but
suffered
from
its
job
said
the
doctor
my
peculiar
philosophy
i
am
not
out
so
much
to
save
these
lives
here
eileen
threatened
to
throw
the
teapot
at
his
head
he
added
of
them
would
be
better
dead
and
anyhow
you
save
a
nation
by
charity
but
what
i
am
out
to
do
is
to
educate
the
heart
of
the
world
above
the
baseness
of
the
passions
that
caused
the
massacre
in
europe
helping
to
do
it
by
saving
the
children
and
by
appealing
to
the
chivalry
of
men
and
women
across
the
old
frontiers
killers
of
cruelty
miss
eileen
and
rather
puffed
up
with
ourselves
we
my
dear
he
grinned
at
eileen
in
a
whimsical
way
and
i
could
see
that
between
this
little
american
and
that
irish
girl
there
was
an
understanding
comradeship
so
he
told
me
when
she
left
the
room
a
minute
to
get
another
or
wash
one
up
girl
he
said
laddie
you
find
a
better
head
in
all
europe
including
hoover
himself
a
napoleon
bonaparte
without
his
horatio
nelson
and
lord
northcliffe
and
nurse
cavell
all
rolled
into
one
to
produce
the
organising
genius
of
eileen
only
you
would
have
to
add
a
few
saints
like
catherine
of
sienna
and
joan
of
arc
to
allow
for
her
spirituality
she
organises
like
you
would
write
a
column
article
she
gets
the
confidence
of
austrian
women
so
that
they
would
kiss
her
feet
if
allow
it
she
has
a
head
for
figures
that
fairly
puts
me
to
shame
and
as
for
her
courage
well
i
mind
telling
you
that
sworn
to
pack
her
back
to
england
if
she
keep
clear
of
typhus
dens
and
other
places
we
afford
to
lose
her
by
some
dirty
eileen
came
into
the
room
again
with
another
and
saucer
i
counted
those
on
the
table
and
saw
three
already
is
the
other
cup
for
i
asked
you
are
expecting
visitors
go
because
badly
in
need
of
a
worry
said
eileen
time
to
wash
in
vienna
and
anyhow
no
soap
for
love
or
money
this
is
for
wickham
who
is
no
visitor
but
one
of
the
i
said
brand
here
said
small
has
been
here
a
week
and
is
doing
good
work
looks
after
the
supplies
and
puts
his
heart
into
the
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
brand
strode
into
the
room
with
rain
dripping
from
his
waterproof
coat
which
he
took
off
and
flung
into
a
corner
before
he
turned
to
the
table
a
cup
of
tea
is
what
i
want
what
you
shall
have
my
dear
said
eileen
you
know
a
friend
when
you
see
him
jove
he
held
my
hand
in
a
hard
grip
and
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
our
friendship
was
beyond
the
need
of
words
so
there
we
three
who
had
seen
many
strange
and
tragic
things
in
those
years
of
history
were
together
again
in
the
city
of
vienna
the
city
of
death
where
the
innocent
were
paying
for
the
guilty
but
where
also
as
small
said
there
was
going
out
a
call
to
charity
which
was
being
heard
by
the
heart
of
the
world
above
the
old
of
cruelty
i
stayed
with
them
only
a
week
i
had
been
long
away
from
england
and
had
other
work
to
do
but
in
that
time
i
saw
how
these
three
friends
and
others
in
their
service
were
devoting
themselves
to
the
rescue
of
human
life
partly
i
think
for
their
own
sake
though
without
conscious
selfishness
and
with
a
passionate
pity
for
those
who
suffered
by
this
service
they
were
healing
their
own
souls
sorely
wounded
in
the
war
that
was
so
certainly
with
wickham
brand
and
a
little
i
think
with
eileen
brand
was
rescued
in
the
nick
of
time
by
the
call
to
him
death
had
struck
him
a
heavy
blow
when
his
nerves
were
already
in
rags
and
tatters
now
by
active
service
in
this
work
of
humanity
and
healing
he
was
getting
back
to
normality
getting
serene
and
steady
i
saw
the
change
in
him
revealed
by
the
light
in
his
eyes
and
by
his
quietude
of
speech
and
the
old
sense
of
humour
which
for
a
while
he
had
lost
see
now
he
said
one
night
no
use
fighting
against
the
injustice
and
brutality
of
life
i
the
world
or
change
the
things
that
are
written
in
history
or
alter
in
any
big
way
the
destiny
of
peoples
stupidity
ignorance
barbarity
will
continue
among
the
multitude
all
that
any
of
us
can
do
is
to
tackle
some
good
job
that
lies
at
hand
and
keep
his
own
soul
bright
and
fearless
if
there
is
any
chance
and
use
his
little
intellect
in
his
little
circle
for
kindness
instead
of
cruelty
i
find
that
chance
here
and
i
am
the
doctor
had
larger
and
bigger
hopes
though
his
philosophy
of
life
was
not
much
different
from
that
of
want
to
fix
up
an
intellectual
company
in
this
funny
old
universe
he
said
want
to
establish
an
intellectual
aristocracy
on
international
lines
the
leaders
of
the
new
world
by
intellectuals
i
mean
fellows
with
letters
after
their
names
and
encyclopaedias
in
their
i
mean
men
and
women
who
by
moral
character
kindness
of
heart
freedom
from
narrow
hatreds
tolerance
of
different
creeds
and
races
and
love
of
humanity
will
unite
in
a
free
unfettered
way
without
a
label
or
a
league
to
get
a
move
on
towards
a
better
system
of
human
society
no
red
bolshevism
mind
you
no
heaven
by
way
of
hell
but
a
striving
for
greater
justice
between
classes
and
nations
and
for
peace
within
the
frontiers
of
christendom
and
beyond
if
possible
getting
back
to
the
influence
of
the
individual
the
leadership
of
multitudes
by
the
power
of
the
higher
mind
doing
it
by
penny
postcards
to
all
my
friends
this
work
of
ours
in
vienna
is
a
good
proof
of
their
response
let
all
the
folk
with
good
hearts
behind
their
brains
start
writing
postcards
to
each
other
with
a
plea
for
brotherhood
charity
peace
and
the
new
world
would
come
you
laugh
yes
i
talk
a
little
nonsense
not
so
easy
as
that
but
see
the
idea
the
leaders
must
keep
in
touch
and
the
herds
will
i
turned
to
eileen
who
was
listening
with
a
smile
about
her
lips
while
she
pasted
labels
on
to
packets
of
cocoa
your
philosophy
i
asked
she
laughed
in
that
deep
voice
of
hers
none
only
the
old
faith
and
a
little
hope
and
a
heart
with
brand
was
adding
up
figures
in
a
book
of
accounts
and
smiled
across
at
the
girl
whom
he
had
known
since
boyhood
when
she
had
pulled
his
hair
his
wounds
were
healing
