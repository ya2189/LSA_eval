this
is

off
with
the

there
is
nothing
to
say
except
again
we
have
had
luncheon
and
i
have
been
poking
things
out
of
my
cabin
trunk
and
furtively
surveying
one
there
are
two
but
the
other
seems
to
be
lost
at
present
of
my
cabin
companions
she
has
fair
hair
and
a
blue
and
looks
quiet
and
subdued
but
then
i
dare
say
so
do
i
hope
you
are
thinking
of
your
friend
going
down
to
the
sea
in
a
ship
i
feel
somehow
very
small
and
lonely
olivia
scotia
whatever
you
do
whatever
folly
you
commit
never
never
be
tempted
to
take
a
sea
voyage
it
is
quite
the
nastiest
thing
you
can
take
i
have
had
three
days
of
it
now
so
i
know
when
i
wrote
to
you
on
saturday
i
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
in
the
near
future
all
would
not
be
well
with
me
but
i
went
in
to
dinner
and
afterwards
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
trying
to
feel
brave
sunday
morning
dawned
and
tempestuous
and
the
way
the
ship
heaved
was
not
encouraging
but
i
rose
or
rather
i
descended
from
my
perch
did
i
tell
you
i
had
an
upper
berth
and
walked
with
an
undulating
motion
towards
my
bath
some
people
would
have
remained
in
bed
or
at
least
gone
unbathed
but
as
i
say
i
rose
mark
please
the
rugged
grandeur
of
the
scots
character
and
such
is
the
force
of
example
the
girl
rose
also
before
i
go
any
further
i
must
tell
you
about
this
girl
her
name
is
hilton
geraldine
hilton
but
as
that
is
too
long
a
name
and
already
we
are
great
friends
i
call
her
she
is
very
pretty
with
the
kind
of
prettiness
that
becomes
more
so
the
more
you
look
and
if
you
do
know
what
i
mean
i
ca
stop
to
explain
with
masses
of
yellow
hair
such
blue
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
and
white
teeth
that
i
am
convinced
i
am
sharing
a
cabin
with
the
original
hans
andersen
snow
queen
she
is
very
big
and
most
healthy
and
delightful
to
look
at
even
does
not
make
her
look
plain
and
that
you
will
admit
is
a
severe
test
and
what
is
more
her
nature
is
as
healthy
and
sweet
as
her
face
you
will
laugh
and
say
it
is
like
me
to
know
all
about
anyone
in
three
days
but
two
and
people
shut
up
in
a
tiny
cabin
can
exhibit
quite
a
lot
of
traits
pleasant
and
otherwise
in
three
days
well
we
dressed
and
reaching
the
saloon
sank
into
our
seats
only
to
leave
again
hurriedly
when
a
steward
approached
to
know
if
we
would
have
porridge
or
kippered
herring
i
know
you
are
never
unlovable
creature
that
you
are
so
you
wo
sympathize
with
us
as
we
lay
limp
and
wretched
in
our
on
the
damp
and
draughty
deck
even
the
fact
that
our
were
and
had
our
names
boldly
painted
in
handsome
black
letters
across
the
back
failed
to
give
us
a
thrill
of
pleasure
at
last
it
became
too
utterly
miserable
to
be
borne
the
sight
of
the
bringing
round
cups
of
with
grease
spots
floating
on
the
top
proved
the
last
straw
so
with
a
graceful
wavering
flight
like
a
woodcock
we
zigzagged
to
our
bunks
where
we
have
remained
ever
since
i
do
know
where
we
are
i
expect
ushant
has
slammed
the
door
on
us
long
ago
our
little
world
is
bounded
by
the
four
walls
of
the
cabin
all
day
we
lie
and
listen
to
the
swish
of
the
waves
as
they
tumble
past
and
watch
our
hanging
on
the
door
swing
backwards
and
forwards
with
the
motion
at
intervals
the
stewardess
comes
in
a
nice
scotswoman
corrie
she
tells
me
is
her
and
brings
the
menu
of
breakfast
luncheon
dinner
and
we
turn
away
our
heads
and
say
nothing
nothing
our
steward
is
a
funny
little
man
very
small
and
thin
with
pale
yellow
hair
he
reminds
me
of
a
moulting
canary
and
his
voice
cheeps
and
is
rather
too
he
is
really
a
very
kind
little
steward
and
trots
about
most
diligently
on
our
errands
and
tries
to
cheer
us
by
tales
of
the
people
he
has
known
who
have
died
of
strained
their
miss
wot
they
done
it
is
very
cheerful
lying
here
looking
out
through
the
now
at
the
sky
next
at
the
sea
but
what
it
would
have
been
without
i
dare
not
think
we
have
certainly
helped
each
other
through
this
time
of
trial
it
is
a
wonderful
blessing
a
companion
in
misfortune
but
where
you
may
ask
is
the
third
occupant
of
the
cabin
would
it
not
have
been
fearful
if
she
too
had
been
stretched
on
a
couch
of
languishing
happily
she
is
a
good
sailor
though
she
does
look
it
she
is
a
little
woman
with
a
pale
green
complexion
and
a
lot
of
sleek
black
hair
and
somehow
gives
one
the
impression
of
having
a
great
many
more
teeth
than
is
usual
her
name
is
murray
and
she
is
going
to
india
to
rejoin
her
husband
who
rejoices
in
the
name
of
albert
sometimes
i
feel
a
little
sorry
for
albert
but
perhaps
after
all
he
deserves
what
he
has
got
she
has
very
assertive
manners
i
think
she
regards
and
me
as
two
young
women
who
want
keeping
in
their
places
though
i
am
sure
we
are
humble
enough
now
whatever
we
may
be
in
a
state
of
rude
health
happily
she
has
friends
on
board
so
she
rarely
comes
to
the
cabin
except
to
tidy
up
before
meals
and
afterwards
to
tell
us
exactly
everything
she
has
eaten
she
seems
to
have
a
good
appetite
and
to
choose
the
things
that
sound
nastiest
when
one
is
seedy
no
i
do
like
murray
much
but
i
dislike
her
more
it
is
large
and
square
and
black
and
it
has
no
business
in
the
cabin
it
ought
to
be
in
the
lying
up
here
i
am
freed
from
its
tyranny
but
on
saturday
when
i
was
unpacking
it
made
my
life
a
burden
it
blocks
up
the
floor
under
my
hooks
and
when
i
hang
things
up
i
fall
over
it
backwards
when
i
sit
on
the
floor
which
i
have
to
do
every
time
i
pull
out
my
trunk
it
hits
me
savagely
on
the
spine
and
once
when
i
tried
balancing
it
on
a
small
chest
of
drawers
it
promptly
fell
down
on
my
head
and
i
have
still
a
large
and
painful
bump
as
a
memento
i
wonder
if
you
will
be
able
to
make
this
letter
out
i
am
writing
it
a
little
bit
at
a
time
to
keep
myself
from
getting
too
dreadfully
and
i
have
both
very
damp
handkerchiefs
under
our
pillows
to
testify
to
the
depressed
state
of
our
minds
when
i
was
at
home
i
was
in
a
better
place
but
travellers
must
be
content
i
do
even
care
to
read
any
of
the
books
i
brought
with
me
except
now
and
then
a
page
or
two
of
and
it
comforts
me
to
read
of
such
steady
quiet
places
as
the
pentland
hills
and
of
the
decent
men
who
do
their
herding
there
is
it
really
only
three
days
since
i
left
you
all
and
you
envied
me
going
out
into
the
sunshine
oh
you
warm
comfortable
people
how
i
in
this
heaving
uncertain
horror
of
a
ship
envy
you
in
you
must
think
i
have
been
lying
here
all
the
time
on
tuesday
we
managed
to
get
on
deck
and
on
wednesday
it
was
warm
and
sunny
and
we
began
to
enjoy
life
again
and
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
having
got
our
but
we
got
them
only
to
lose
them
for
yesterday
the
wind
got
up
the
ship
rolled
we
became
every
minute
more
thoughtful
until
about
we
retired
in
disorder
it
did
need
the
little
steward
shocked
remark
oh
my
you
never
gone
back
to
bed
again
to
make
us
feel
ashamed
however
we
reach
marseilles
at
noon
and
glorious
thought
the
ship
will
stand
still
for
hours
also
there
will
be
letters
this
is
a
letter
so
much
as
a
wail
do
scoff
i
know
i
a
coward
a
is
really
a
great
comfort
i
am
writing
with
my
new
one
so
this
letter
wo
i
hope
be
such
a
puzzle
to
decipher
as
my
pencil
scrawl
we
are
off
again
but
now
the
sun
shines
from
a
cloudless
sky
on
a
sea
of
sapphire
and
the
passengers
are
sunning
themselves
on
deck
like
snails
after
a
shower
i
glad
after
all
i
did
go
back
from
marseilles
by
train
when
we
reached
marseilles
the
rain
was
pouring
but
that
prevent
us
us
means
and
myself
from
bounding
on
shore
we
found
a
dilapidated
driven
by
a
still
more
dilapidated
who
for
the
sum
of
six
francs
drove
us
to
the
town
i
do
know
whether
ordinarily
marseilles
is
a
beautiful
town
or
an
ugly
one
few
people
i
expect
would
have
seen
anything
attractive
in
it
this
dark
rainy
october
afternoon
but
to
us
it
was
a
sort
of
paradise
regained
we
had
tea
at
a
caf√©
real
french
tea
tasting
of
and
lukewarm
water
and
real
french
cakes
we
wandered
through
the
streets
stopping
to
stare
in
at
every
shop
window
we
bought
violets
to
adorn
ourselves
and
and
sheets
of
foreign
stamps
for
peter
and
all
the
time
the
rain
poured
and
the
street
lamps
were
cheerily
reflected
in
the
wet
pavements
and
it
was
so
damp
and
dark
and
dirty
and
we
sloppered
joyfully
through
the
mud
and
were
happy
for
the
first
time
for
a
whole
week
the
thought
of
letters
was
the
only
thing
that
tempted
us
back
to
the
ship
i
heard
from
all
the
home
people
even
peter
wrote
a
most
characteristic
epistle
with
only
about
half
the
words
wrongly
spelt
and
finishing
with
a
spirited
drawing
of
the
attacked
by
pirates
an
abject
figure
crouching
in
the
bows
being
labelled
you
how
i
miss
that
young
brother
of
mine
i
ache
to
see
his
nubbly
features
nubbly
is
a
portmanteau
word
and
exactly
describes
them
and
the
hair
that
no
brush
can
persuade
to
lie
straight
and
to
hear
the
broad
accent
a
legacy
from
a
nurse
who
hailed
from
a
mining
village
in
lithgow
which
is
such
a
trial
to
his
relatives
i
have
no
illusions
about
peter
looks
any
more
than
he
has
himself
a
too
candid
relative
commenting
once
on
his
excessive
plainness
in
his
presence
he
replied
yes
i
know
but
i
a
nice
good
face
i
sometimes
feel
that
if
peter
turns
out
badly
it
will
be
greatly
my
fault
mother
was
so
busy
with
many
things
that
i
naturally
as
the
big
sister
did
most
of
the
training
and
it
was
easy
when
i
read
to
him
on
sunday
of
the
he
at
once
made
up
his
mind
that
he
much
preferred
claverhouse
to
john
brown
of
priesthill
an
heresy
and
yawning
vigorously
announced
that
he
was
as
dull
as
a
bull
and
as
sick
as
a
daisy
one
night
when
i
went
to
hear
him
say
his
prayers
he
said
i
not
going
to
say
any
prayers
oh
peter
i
said
why
i
prayed
for
a
whole
year
it
would
be
snow
on
christmas
and
it
was
just
rain
then
i
said
very
gravely
god
wo
take
care
of
you
through
the
night
put
me
in
my
bed
said
the
little
ruffian
and
i
see
and
i
was
awakened
at
break
of
day
by
a
small
figure
in
pyjamas
dancing
at
my
bedside
shouting
with
unholy
joy
i
here
you
see
i
here
and
it
was
weeks
before
i
could
bring
him
to
a
better
state
of
mind
so
much
younger
than
any
of
us
the
other
boys
were
at
oxford
when
he
was
in
his
first
knickerbockers
he
was
a
lonely
little
soul
and
lived
in
a
world
of
his
own
peopled
by
the
creatures
of
his
own
imaginings
his
great
friend
was
bathboth
of
bathboth
do
you
like
the
name
and
he
would
come
in
from
a
walk
with
his
nurse
fling
down
his
cap
and
remark
i
been
seeing
bathboth
in
his
own
house
oh
a
lovely
house
it
a
i
afraid
he
was
a
very
low
character
this
bathboth
according
to
peter
he
smoked
and
he
swored
and
he
put
his
fingers
to
his
nose
when
his
mother
said
he
was
to
so
we
were
surprised
to
hear
of
his
end
he
was
pulled
up
to
heaven
by
a
crane
for
bathing
in
the
sea
on
sunday
another
of
peter
creatures
was
a
bogle
called
windy
wallops
who
lived
in
the
garrets
and
could
only
be
repulsed
with
hairbrushes
whippetie
stoowrie
on
the
other
hand
was
a
kindly
creature
inhabiting
the
nursery
chimney
and
given
to
laying
small
offerings
such
as
a
pistol
and
caps
or
a
sugar
mouse
on
the
fender
a
strange
fancy
once
took
peter
to
dig
graves
for
us
all
in
the
garden
it
was
that
he
disliked
us
on
the
contrary
he
considered
he
was
doing
us
an
honour
my
grave
was
suggestively
near
the
but
he
pointed
out
that
it
was
because
the
grew
there
one
day
he
came
in
earthy
but
dodo
send
me
anything
for
my
birthday
he
announced
so
i
up
his
now
peter
has
gone
to
school
and
has
put
away
childish
things
and
the
desire
to
be
a
knight
like
launcelot
he
no
longer
babbles
to
himself
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
strangers
doubt
of
his
sanity
and
he
confided
to
me
lately
that
when
he
grew
up
he
hoped
to
lead
a
double
life
he
who
was
brought
up
in
camelot
he
who
wept
when
roland
at
roncesvalles
blew
his
horn
for
the
last
time
now
devours
detective
stories
vile
things
in
paper
covers
which
he
keeps
concealed
about
his
person
and
whips
out
at
odd
moments
what
he
hates
is
a
book
with
the
slightest
hint
of
a
love
affair
i
found
him
disgustedly
punching
a
book
with
his
fist
and
muttering
evidently
to
the
hero
i
know
you
i
know
you
you
in
love
with
her
in
tones
of
bitter
scorn
when
i
begin
to
speak
about
peter
i
ca
stop
and
forget
how
tiresome
it
must
be
for
people
to
listen
i
apologize
but
please
bear
with
me
when
i
enlarge
upon
this
brother
of
mine
i
simply
must
sometimes
how
good
of
you
to
write
such
a
long
letter
of
course
i
shall
write
often
and
at
length
but
you
must
promise
not
to
be
bored
or
expect
too
much
i
fear
you
wo
get
anything
very
wise
or
witty
from
me
you
know
how
limited
i
am
the
fairies
when
they
came
to
my
christening
might
have
come
better
provided
with
gifts
but
then
i
expect
they
have
only
a
certain
number
of
gifts
for
each
family
so
i
do
in
the
least
blame
them
for
giving
the
boys
the
brains
and
giving
me
what
at
the
moment
i
ca
think
of
anything
they
did
give
me
except
a
heart
that
keeps
on
the
windy
side
of
care
as
beatrice
puts
it
and
hair
that
curls
naturally
i
have
no
grudge
against
the
fairies
if
they
had
given
me
straight
hair
and
brains
i
might
have
been
a
suffragist
and
shamed
my
kin
by
biting
a
policeman
and
would
have
been
a
pity
and
i
are
crouched
in
a
corner
very
awed
and
sad
a
poor
man
died
suddenly
yesterday
from
heart
failure
and
the
funeral
is
just
over
i
do
hope
i
shall
never
again
see
a
burial
at
sea
it
was
terrible
the
bell
tolled
and
the
ship
slowed
down
and
almost
stopped
while
the
body
wrapped
in
a
union
jack
was
slipped
into
the
water
committed
to
the
deep
in
sure
and
certain
hope
of
a
blessed
resurrection
in
a
minute
it
was
all
over
the
people
are
laughing
and
talking
again
the
has
sounded
things
go
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
we
are
steaming
ahead
leaving
the
body
such
a
little
speck
it
looked
on
the
great
water
far
behind
it
is
the
utter
loneliness
of
it
that
makes
me
cry
scotia
this
wo
be
a
tidy
letter
for
i
am
sitting
close
beside
the
rail
has
it
a
nautical
name
i
do
know
and
every
few
minutes
the
spray
comes
over
and
wets
the
paper
and
incidentally
myself
the
i
greatly
fear
it
leaks
for
my
middle
finger
is
blackened
beyond
hope
of
cleansing
and
though
not
ten
minutes
ago
mr
brand
inked
himself
very
comprehensively
filling
it
for
me
already
it
requires
frequent
shakings
to
make
it
write
at
all
i
thought
it
would
be
a
blessing
it
threatens
to
become
a
curse
i
foresee
that
very
shortly
i
shall
descend
again
to
a
pencil
or
write
my
letters
with
the
aid
of
scratchy
pens
and
fat
respectable
in
the
stuffy
you
will
have
two
letters
from
port
said
the
one
i
wrote
you
two
days
ago
finished
in
deep
melancholy
but
it
is
so
good
to
be
alive
i
could
shout
with
joy
i
woke
this
morning
with
a
jump
of
delight
and
even
albert
murray
she
of
the
and
the
many
teeth
could
not
irritate
me
and
you
ca
think
how
many
irritating
ways
the
woman
has
it
is
and
we
have
just
come
up
from
breakfast
and
have
got
our
placed
where
they
will
catch
every
breeze
and
some
salt
water
and
with
a
pile
of
books
and
two
boxes
of
chocolate
are
comfortably
settled
for
the
day
you
ask
about
the
passengers
we
have
all
sorts
and
conditions
quiet
people
who
read
and
work
all
day
rowdy
people
who
never
seem
happy
unless
they
are
throwing
cushions
or
pulling
one
another
downstairs
by
the
feet
painfully
enterprising
people
who
get
up
sports
sweeps
concerts
and
dances
and
are
full
of
a
tiresome
misplaced
energy
people
who
play
from
morning
till
night
flirtatious
people
who
frequent
dark
corners
happy
people
who
laugh
sad
people
who
sniff
and
one
man
who
ca
be
classed
with
anyone
else
a
sad
gentleman
his
hair
standing
fiercely
on
end
a
greek
testament
his
constant
and
only
companion
we
pine
to
know
who
and
what
he
is
and
where
he
is
going
yesterday
i
found
myself
beside
him
at
tea
i
might
not
have
existed
for
all
the
notice
he
took
of
me
speak
to
him
said
in
my
ear
you
dare
of
course
after
that
i
had
to
so
pinching
g
arm
to
give
myself
courage
i
said
in
a
small
voice
are
you
enjoying
the
voyage
he
turned
regarded
me
with
his
sad
prominent
eyes
do
i
look
as
if
i
enjoyed
it
asked
this
monsieur
melancholy
and
went
back
to
his
choked
and
i
finished
my
tea
hurriedly
and
in
silence
nearly
everyone
on
board
seems
nice
and
willing
to
be
pleasant
i
am
on
smiling
terms
with
most
and
speaking
terms
with
many
but
one
really
sees
very
little
of
the
people
outside
one
own
little
set
it
is
odd
how
people
drift
together
and
make
cliques
there
are
eight
in
our
particular
set
colonel
and
crawley
major
and
wilmot
captain
gordon
mr
brand
and
myself
the
crawleys
the
wilmots
and
captain
gordon
are
going
back
after
furlough
mr
brand
and
and
i
are
going
only
for
pleasure
and
the
cold
weather
our
table
is
much
the
merriest
in
the
saloon
crawley
is
a
fascinating
woman
i
never
tire
watching
her
very
pretty
very
smart
with
a
pretty
wit
she
has
the
most
delightfully
gay
infectious
laugh
which
contrasts
oddly
with
her
curiously
sad
unsmiling
eyes
wilmot
has
a
madonna
face
i
do
mean
one
of
those
silly
madonnas
one
sees
in
the
louvre
and
elsewhere
but
one
own
idea
of
the
madonna
the
kind
of
face
as
someone
puts
it
that
god
must
love
she
is
pretty
and
she
is
in
the
least
smart
but
she
is
just
a
kind
sweet
wise
woman
her
husband
is
a
cheery
soul
very
big
and
boyish
and
always
in
uproarious
spirits
captain
gordon
makes
a
good
listener
mr
brand
although
he
must
have
left
school
quite
ten
years
ago
is
still
very
reminiscent
of
eton
and
has
a
taste
in
silly
rhymes
and
riddles
colonel
crawley
a
stern
and
somewhat
man
a
distinguished
soldier
i
am
told
hates
being
asked
riddles
and
we
make
him
frantic
at
table
repeating
mr
brand
witticisms
he
sits
with
a
patient
disgusted
face
while
we
repeat
owen
more
had
run
away
owin
more
than
he
could
pay
owen
more
came
back
one
day
owin
more
and
when
he
can
bear
it
no
longer
leaves
the
table
remarking
he
had
his
revenge
the
other
day
when
the
ship
was
rolling
more
than
a
little
we
had
ventured
to
the
saloon
for
tea
and
were
surveying
uncertainly
some
dry
toast
when
colonel
crawley
came
in
ah
he
said
steward
pork
chops
for
these
ladies
the
mere
thought
proved
the
thing
too
much
we
fled
to
the
fresh
air
tealess
i
meant
this
to
be
a
very
long
letter
but
this
pen
faint
yet
pursuing
shows
signs
of
giving
out
i
have
to
shake
it
every
second
word
now
the
bugle
has
gone
for
lunch
and
who
has
been
sound
asleep
for
the
last
hour
is
uncoiling
herself
preparatory
to
going
down
so
scotia
all
day
we
have
glided
through
the
canal
imagine
a
shining
band
of
silver
water
a
band
of
deepest
blue
sky
and
in
between
a
bar
of
fine
gold
which
is
the
desert
and
you
have
some
idea
of
what
i
am
looking
at
sometimes
an
arab
passes
riding
on
a
camel
and
i
get
away
from
the
feeling
that
i
am
a
child
again
looking
at
a
highly
coloured
bible
on
sabbath
afternoons
we
landed
at
port
said
yesterday
morning
people
told
us
it
was
a
dirty
place
an
uninteresting
place
a
horribly
dull
place
not
worth
leaving
the
ship
to
see
but
it
was
our
first
glimpse
of
the
east
and
we
were
enchanted
the
narrow
streets
the
white
domes
and
minarets
against
the
blue
sky
the
flat
roofs
of
the
houses
the
queer
shops
with
the
arabs
shouting
to
draw
attention
to
their
wares
and
above
all
the
new
strange
smell
of
the
east
were
to
us
wonderful
and
fascinating
when
we
got
ashore
the
sun
was
shining
with
a
directness
hitherto
unknown
to
us
making
the
backs
of
our
unprotected
heads
feel
somewhat
insecure
so
we
went
first
to
a
shop
where
we
spied
exposed
to
sale
a
rich
profusion
of
topis
in
case
you
do
know
a
topi
is
a
a
white
thing
large
and
lined
with
green
with
cork
about
it
somewhere
rather
suggestive
of
a
lifebelt
horribly
unbecoming
but
quite
necessary
a
very
polite
man
bowed
us
inside
and
we
proceeded
on
our
quixotic
search
for
a
topi
not
entirely
hideous
half
an
hour
later
we
came
out
of
the
shop
the
shopman
more
obsequious
than
ever
not
only
wearing
topis
but
laden
with
boxes
of
turkish
delight
fans
tinsel
scarves
and
a
string
of
pink
beads
which
he
swore
were
coral
but
i
greatly
doubt
it
we
had
an
uneasy
feeling
as
we
bought
the
things
that
perhaps
we
were
foolish
virgins
but
before
the
afternoon
was
very
old
we
were
sure
of
it
you
would
believe
how
heavy
turkish
delight
becomes
when
you
carry
half
a
dozen
boxes
for
some
hours
under
a
blazing
sun
and
i
had
a
carved
under
one
arm
and
had
four
parcels
and
a
green
umbrella
to
complete
our
disgust
after
weltering
under
our
purchases
for
some
time
we
saw
in
a
shop
exactly
the
same
things
much
cheaper
pointed
a
wrathful
finger
letting
two
parcels
fall
to
do
it
look
at
that
she
said
going
straight
back
to
tell
the
man
he
cheated
us
with
difficulty
i
persuaded
her
it
was
worth
while
and
tired
and
dusty
we
sank
no
we
did
sink
they
were
iron
chairs
we
sat
down
hard
on
chairs
outside
a
big
hotel
and
demanded
tea
immediately
some
of
the
ship
people
were
also
having
tea
at
little
tables
and
a
party
of
frenchmen
were
twanging
guitars
and
singing
sentimental
songs
for
pennies
while
we
were
waiting
a
man
an
arab
i
think
crouched
beside
us
and
begged
us
to
let
him
read
our
hands
for
half
a
crown
and
we
were
weak
enough
to
permit
it
you
may
be
interested
to
know
that
i
am
to
be
married
soon
already
to
a
high
official
with
gold
in
his
teeth
it
sounds
ideal
was
rather
awed
by
the
varied
career
he
sketched
for
her
after
tea
which
was
long
in
coming
and
when
it
came
disappointing
we
had
still
some
time
so
we
hailed
a
man
driving
a
horse
attached
to
a
carriage
of
sorts
and
told
him
to
drive
us
all
round
he
looked
a
very
wicked
man
but
it
may
have
been
the
effect
of
his
only
having
one
eye
for
he
certainly
had
a
refined
taste
in
sights
when
we
suggested
that
we
would
like
to
see
the
arab
bazaar
he
shook
his
head
violently
and
instead
drove
us
along
dull
roads
stopping
now
and
again
to
wave
a
vague
whip
towards
some
building
remarking
in
most
melancholy
tones
as
he
did
so
the
english
church
the
american
mission
back
on
the
ship
again
sitting
on
deck
in
the
soft
darkness
watching
the
lights
of
the
town
and
hearing
a
faint
echo
of
the
life
there
i
realized
with
something
of
a
shock
that
it
was
does
that
convey
nothing
to
your
mind
to
me
it
brings
back
memories
of
cold
days
and
myself
jumping
over
in
the
chanting
this
is
the
nicht
o
when
a
the
witches
will
be
seen
in
fearful
hope
of
seeing
a
witch
not
mounted
on
a
broomstick
but
on
the
respectable
household
cat
changed
for
that
night
into
a
flying
fury
finally
along
with
my
brothers
being
captured
washed
and
dressed
to
join
with
other
spirits
worse
than
ourselves
in
dooking
for
apples
and
eating
mashed
potatoes
in
momentary
expectation
of
swallowing
a
or
a
thimble
far
from
the
other
spirits
far
from
the
chill
winds
and
the
i
have
been
watching
the
sunset
on
the
desert
making
the
world
a
glory
of
rose
and
gold
and
amethyst
now
it
is
dark
the
lights
are
lit
all
over
the
ship
the
floor
of
heaven
is
thick
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
in
such
a
night
did
young
lorenzo
our
derive
much
amusement
from
the
way
we
sit
and
scribble
and
one
man
asked
me
if
i
were
writing
a
book
all
this
time
i
have
mentioned
the
port
said
letters
we
got
them
before
we
left
the
ship
and
determined
for
once
to
show
myself
a
sensible
young
person
i
took
mine
to
the
cabin
and
locked
them
firmly
in
a
trunk
telling
myself
how
nice
it
would
be
to
read
them
in
peace
on
my
return
the
spirit
was
willing
but
i
found
i
must
rush
down
to
take
just
a
peep
to
see
if
everyone
was
well
and
the
game
ended
with
me
sitting
uncomfortably
on
the
knobby
edge
of
albert
bunk
breathlessly
tearing
open
envelopes
they
were
all
delightful
and
i
have
read
them
many
times
i
have
yours
beside
me
now
and
to
make
it
like
a
real
talk
i
shall
answer
each
point
as
it
comes
you
say
the
sun
has
shone
since
i
left
are
you
by
any
chance
paying
me
a
compliment
or
are
you
merely
stating
a
fact
as
pet
marjorie
would
say
i
am
primmed
up
with
majestic
pride
because
of
the
compliments
i
receive
one
lady
whose
baby
i
held
for
a
little
this
morning
told
me
i
had
such
a
sweet
unspoiled
disposition
but
what
really
pleased
me
and
made
me
feel
inches
taller
was
that
captain
gordon
told
someone
who
told
me
that
he
thought
i
had
great
stability
of
character
it
is
odd
how
one
loves
to
be
told
one
has
what
one
has
i
who
have
no
more
stability
of
character
than
a
felt
warm
with
gratitude
only
i
should
like
to
make
my
exit
now
before
he
discovers
how
mistaken
he
is
yes
i
wish
you
were
sitting
by
my
side
racing
through
the
waves
indeed
i
wish
all
my
dear
people
were
here
are
you
really
feeling
lonely
you
popular
young
man
of
many
engagements
lonely
and
dissatisfied
are
your
words
but
why
why
surely
no
one
ever
had
less
reason
to
feel
dissatisfied
there
are
very
many
people
my
friend
who
would
mind
being
you
and
yet
you
are
thankful
not
thankful
for
the
interesting
life
you
have
the
plays
you
see
the
dinners
you
eat
the
charming
women
you
talk
to
the
balls
you
dance
at
the
clubs
you
frequent
though
what
a
man
does
at
his
clubs
beyond
escaping
for
a
brief
season
from
his
womenkind
i
never
quite
know
think
how
nice
to
be
a
man
and
not
have
to
look
pleased
when
one
is
really
bored
to
extinction
if
you
are
bored
you
have
only
to
slip
away
to
your
most
comfortable
rooms
did
i
tell
you
how
much
i
liked
your
rooms
that
day
margie
and
i
went
to
tea
with
you
or
were
we
too
busy
talking
about
other
things
now
do
be
like
peter
he
was
grumbling
about
something
and
i
told
him
to
go
away
and
count
his
blessings
he
went
obediently
and
returned
triumphant
i
done
it
he
said
and
i
six
things
to
be
thankful
for
and
nine
to
be
unthankful
for
one
thing
for
which
i
think
you
might
feel
unthankful
is
your
lamentable
lack
of
near
relations
it
is
hard
to
be
quite
alone
in
the
world
for
i
agree
aunts
do
count
for
much
weighed
in
the
balance
they
are
generally
found
woefully
wanting
i
remember
once
when
we
were
laughing
over
some
escapade
of
our
childhood
you
said
you
had
no
very
pleasant
recollection
of
your
childish
days
that
you
did
look
forward
to
holidays
and
that
your
happiest
time
was
at
school
because
then
you
had
companions
i
feel
quite
sad
when
i
think
what
you
missed
we
were
very
lucky
four
of
us
growing
up
together
and
i
sometimes
wonder
if
other
children
had
the
same
full
splendid
time
we
had
and
if
they
employed
it
getting
into
as
many
scrapes
the
village
people
shaking
their
heads
over
us
and
our
probable
end
used
to
say
they
a
bad
but
the
lassie
meaning
me
is
the
verra
deil
we
were
bad
but
we
were
also
extraordinarily
happy
i
treasure
up
all
sorts
of
memories
some
of
them
very
trivial
and
absurd
store
them
away
in
lavender
and
when
i
feel
dreary
i
take
them
out
and
refresh
myself
with
them
one
episode
i
specially
remember
though
why
i
should
tell
you
about
it
i
do
quite
know
for
it
is
a
small
thing
and
silly
sooth
we
were
staying
at
the
time
with
our
grandmother
the
grandmother
i
am
called
for
a
very
stern
and
stately
lady
the
only
person
i
have
ever
really
stood
in
awe
of
we
had
been
wandering
all
day
led
by
john
searching
for
hidden
treasure
at
the
rainbow
foot
climbing
high
hills
to
see
if
the
world
came
to
an
end
at
the
other
side
or
some
equally
fantastic
quest
it
was
dark
and
almost
and
we
had
committed
the
heinous
crime
of
not
appearing
for
tea
so
when
we
were
told
to
go
at
once
to
see
our
grandmother
and
stumbled
just
as
we
were
tired
and
dusty
hair
on
end
and
stockings
at
our
ankles
into
the
quiet
room
where
she
sat
knitting
fleecy
white
things
by
the
table
with
the
lamp
we
expected
nothing
better
than
to
be
sent
straight
to
bed
probably
supperless
our
grandmother
laid
down
her
knitting
took
off
her
spectacles
and
instead
of
the
rebuke
we
expected
and
deserved
said
bairns
come
away
in
i
sure
you
must
be
tired
it
had
been
an
unsuccessful
day
we
had
found
no
treasure
not
even
the
end
the
night
had
fallen
damp
with
an
eerily
sighing
wind
which
depressed
us
vaguely
as
we
trudged
homewards
but
now
the
black
night
shut
out
there
was
the
and
the
the
kind
old
voice
and
the
delicious
sense
of
having
come
home
all
things
considered
you
are
a
young
man
greatly
to
be
envied
also
at
the
present
moment
to
be
scolded
how
can
you
possibly
allow
yourself
to
think
such
silly
things
you
must
have
a
most
exaggerated
idea
of
my
charms
if
you
think
every
man
on
board
must
be
in
love
with
me
men
are
so
impressionable
did
you
think
that
when
my
unearthly
beauty
burst
on
them
they
would
fall
on
their
knees
and
with
one
voice
exclaim
be
mine
i
assure
you
no
one
has
ever
even
thought
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
and
if
they
had
tell
i
know
you
are
only
chaffing
but
i
do
so
hate
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
to
hear
people
talk
of
their
conquests
is
revolting
one
of
the
nicest
things
about
is
that
she
does
care
a
bit
to
philander
about
with
men
she
and
i
are
much
happier
talking
to
each
other
a
fact
which
people
seem
to
find
hard
to
believe
my
attention
is
being
diverted
from
my
writing
by
a
lady
sitting
a
few
yards
away
the
candle
we
call
her
because
so
many
silly
young
moths
hover
round
she
is
a
buxom
person
with
very
golden
hair
growing
darker
towards
the
roots
hard
blue
eyes
and
a
powdery
white
face
and
i
are
intensely
interested
to
know
what
is
the
attraction
about
her
for
no
one
can
deny
there
is
one
she
is
young
the
gods
have
not
made
her
fair
and
i
doubt
of
her
honesty
yet
from
the
first
she
has
been
surrounded
by
men
most
of
them
i
grant
you
unfinished
youths
bound
to
offices
in
calcutta
but
still
men
i
thought
it
might
be
her
brilliant
conversation
but
for
the
last
i
have
listened
indeed
we
have
no
choice
but
to
listen
the
voices
are
so
strident
and
it
ca
be
that
because
it
is
brilliant
or
even
amusing
unless
to
call
men
names
like
pyjamas
or
fatty
or
tubby
and
slap
them
playfully
at
intervals
is
amusing
a
few
minutes
ago
crawley
came
to
sit
with
us
looking
so
fresh
in
a
white
linen
dress
i
do
know
why
it
is
she
wears
the
simplest
clothes
and
yet
she
manages
to
make
all
the
other
women
look
dowdy
she
has
the
gift
too
of
knowing
the
right
thing
to
wear
on
every
occasion
at
port
said
for
instance
the
costumes
were
varied
the
candle
flopped
on
shore
in
a
trailing
white
lace
dress
and
an
enormous
hat
some
broiled
in
serge
coats
and
skirts
crawley
in
a
soft
green
muslin
and
hat
was
a
cool
and
dainty
vision
well
to
return
as
crawley
shook
up
her
chintz
cushions
she
looked
across
at
the
candle
a
long
look
that
took
in
the
elaborate
golden
hair
the
much
too
smart
blouse
the
abbreviated
skirt
showing
the
slippers
the
crowd
of
callow
youths
and
then
smiling
slightly
to
herself
settled
down
in
her
chair
i
grew
hot
all
over
for
the
candle
i
do
suppose
i
need
trouble
myself
i
expect
she
is
used
to
having
women
look
at
her
like
that
and
does
mind
does
she
really
like
silly
boys
so
much
and
other
women
so
little
i
wonder
there
is
generally
something
rather
nasty
about
a
woman
who
declares
she
get
on
with
other
women
and
whom
other
women
do
like
men
have
an
absurd
notion
that
we
ca
admire
another
woman
or
admit
her
good
points
it
is
so
we
admire
a
pretty
woman
just
as
much
as
you
do
the
only
difference
is
you
men
think
that
if
a
woman
has
a
lovely
face
it
follows
as
the
night
the
day
that
she
must
have
a
lovely
disposition
we
know
better
that
all
the
poor
candle
i
feel
so
mean
and
guilty
writing
about
her
under
her
very
eyes
so
to
speak
she
looked
at
me
just
now
quite
kindly
i
have
a
good
mind
to
tear
this
up
but
after
all
what
does
it
matter
my
silly
little
observations
wo
make
any
impression
on
your
masculine
mind
only
do
say
spiteful
little
cat
because
i
do
mean
to
be
really
this
is
much
the
longest
letter
i
ever
wrote
you
will
have
to
read
a
page
at
a
time
and
then
take
a
long
breath
and
try
again
mr
brand
has
just
come
up
to
ask
us
why
a
sculptor
dies
a
horrible
death
do
you
know
scotia
no
one
unendowed
with
the
temper
of
an
angel
and
the
patience
of
a
job
should
attempt
the
voyage
to
india
albert
murray
has
neither
of
these
qualifications
any
more
than
i
have
and
for
two
days
she
deigned
to
address
a
remark
to
or
me
all
because
of
a
lost
pair
of
stockings
a
loss
which
we
treated
with
unseemly
levity
however
the
chill
haughtiness
of
our
cabin
companion
is
something
of
a
relief
in
this
terrible
heat
for
it
hot
i
am
writing
in
the
cabin
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
two
electric
fans
buzzing
on
either
side
of
me
i
am
hotter
than
i
can
say
and
deplorably
four
times
this
morning
trying
to
keep
out
of
albert
way
i
have
fallen
over
that
wretched
still
here
despite
our
hints
about
the
and
now
in
revenge
i
am
sitting
on
it
though
what
the
owner
would
say
if
she
came
in
suddenly
and
found
to
what
base
uses
i
had
put
her
treasure
i
dare
not
let
myself
think
has
a
bad
headache
and
it
is
dull
for
her
to
be
alone
so
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
in
the
cabin
at
all
to
be
honest
it
is
most
unpleasant
on
deck
rainy
with
a
damp
hot
wind
blowing
and
the
is
crowded
and
stuffy
beyond
words
or
i
might
not
be
unselfish
enough
to
remain
with
i
did
go
up
and
a
fat
person
whose
nurse
was
ill
gave
me
her
baby
to
hold
a
poor
fretful
baby
who
pulled
down
all
my
hair
and
i
have
had
the
unpleasant
task
of
doing
it
up
again
if
you
have
ever
stood
in
a
very
hot
greenhouse
with
the
door
shut
and
wrestled
with
something
above
your
head
you
will
know
what
i
felt
we
passed
aden
yesterday
and
stopped
for
a
few
hours
to
coal
that
was
the
limit
the
sun
beating
down
on
the
deck
the
absence
of
the
slightest
breeze
sifting
into
everything
ouf
barren
rocks
reminded
me
rather
of
the
skye
coolin
i
wonder
if
they
are
climbable
i
have
troubled
you
much
have
i
with
accounts
of
the
entertainments
on
board
but
i
think
i
must
tell
you
about
a
whistling
competition
we
had
the
other
day
you
must
know
that
we
had
each
a
partner
and
the
women
sat
at
one
end
of
the
deck
and
the
men
stood
at
the
other
and
were
told
the
tune
they
had
to
whistle
when
they
rushed
to
us
and
each
whistled
his
tune
to
his
partner
who
had
to
write
the
name
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
hand
it
back
and
the
man
who
got
back
to
the
umpire
first
won
at
least
his
partner
did
do
you
understand
well
as
you
know
i
have
much
ear
for
music
and
i
hoped
i
would
get
an
easy
tune
but
when
my
partner
a
long
thin
earnest
man
with
a
stutter
burst
on
me
and
whistled
wildly
in
my
face
i
had
the
hopeless
feeling
that
i
had
never
heard
the
tune
before
in
his
earnestness
he
came
nearer
and
nearer
his
contortions
every
moment
becoming
more
extraordinary
his
whistling
more
piercing
and
i
by
this
time
convulsed
by
awful
helpless
laughter
could
only
shrink
farther
back
in
my
seat
and
gasp
feebly
please
do
crawley
was
not
much
better
in
my
own
misery
i
was
aware
of
her
voice
saying
politely
i
have
no
idea
what
the
tune
is
but
you
whistle
beautifully
quite
like
a
gramophone
when
my
disgusted
and
exhausted
partner
ceased
trying
to
emulate
a
and
began
to
look
human
again
i
timidly
inquired
what
he
had
been
whistling
the
tune
he
replied
very
stiffly
was
britannia
dear
me
i
replied
meekly
i
thought
at
least
it
was
something
from
but
he
deigned
no
reply
and
walked
away
evidently
hating
me
quite
bitterly
i
sha
play
that
game
again
and
i
ca
believe
the
silly
man
really
whistled
rule
britannia
for
it
is
a
simple
tune
and
one
with
which
i
am
entirely
at
home
whereas
but
no
matter
won
by
guessing
annie
laurie
she
is
splendid
at
all
games
and
did
i
tell
you
how
well
she
sings
in
the
cabin
when
we
are
alone
she
sings
to
me
snatches
of
all
sorts
of
songs
grave
and
gay
but
she
wo
sing
in
the
saloon
where
every
other
woman
on
board
with
the
smallest
pretensions
to
a
voice
carols
nightly
she
is
a
most
attractive
person
this
with
quaint
little
whimsical
ways
that
make
her
very
lovable
we
are
together
every
minute
of
the
day
and
yet
we
never
tire
of
one
another
company
i
rather
think
i
do
most
of
the
talking
if
it
is
true
that
to
be
slow
in
words
is
a
woman
only
virtue
then
indeed
is
my
state
pitiable
for
talk
i
must
and
is
a
delightful
person
to
talk
to
she
listens
to
my
tales
of
peter
and
the
others
and
asks
for
more
and
shouts
with
laughter
at
the
smallest
joke
i
pass
as
a
wit
with
and
have
a
great
success
she
is
going
to
stay
with
a
married
sister
for
the
cold
weather
quite
like
me
only
i
going
to
an
unmarried
brother
i
think
we
are
both
getting
slightly
impertinent
to
our
elders
they
tease
us
so
at
meals
in
the
saloon
we
have
to
answer
back
in
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
help
trying
to
be
smart
sometimes
at
least
with
me
it
degenerates
into
rudeness
i
told
you
about
all
the
people
at
our
table
but
i
forgot
one
a
very
aged
man
with
a
long
white
beard
rather
like
the
evil
magician
in
the
fairy
tales
but
most
harmless
old
sir
thomas
erpingham
i
call
him
for
i
am
sure
a
good
soft
pillow
for
that
good
grey
head
were
better
than
the
churlish
turf
of
india
he
is
very
kind
and
calls
us
sunshine
and
brightness
and
pays
us
the
most
involved
early
victorian
compliments
which
we
talking
and
laughing
all
the
time
seldom
ever
hear
and
it
is
left
to
kind
wilmot
to
respond
last
night
we
had
an
excitement
we
got
into
a
thick
fog
and
had
to
stand
still
and
hoot
while
something
a
steamer
they
say
nearly
ran
us
down
the
people
sleeping
on
deck
said
it
was
most
awesome
but
i
slept
peacefully
through
it
until
awakened
by
an
american
female
running
down
the
corridor
and
remarking
at
the
top
of
a
singularly
piercing
voice
wal
i
am
scared
it
is
beautifully
calm
and
bright
the
nasty
hot
damp
wind
has
gone
and
we
are
sitting
in
our
own
little
corner
of
the
deck
crawley
wilmot
and
i
sometimes
reading
sometimes
writing
very
often
talking
it
is
luck
for
us
to
have
two
such
charming
women
to
talk
to
crawley
is
supposed
to
be
my
chaperon
i
believe
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
boggley
who
is
a
great
friend
of
hers
wrote
and
asked
her
to
look
after
me
how
clever
of
him
to
fix
on
one
in
every
way
so
desirable
suppose
he
had
asked
the
candle
we
have
such
splendid
talks
about
books
wilmot
has
i
think
read
everything
that
has
been
written
also
she
is
very
keen
about
poetry
and
has
my
gift
or
is
it
a
vice
of
being
able
to
say
great
pieces
by
heart
so
between
us
is
sometimes
just
a
little
bored
you
see
has
been
brought
up
in
a
bookish
atmosphere
and
that
makes
such
a
difference
the
other
night
she
was
brushing
her
hair
unusually
silent
and
evidently
thinking
deeply
at
last
she
looked
up
at
me
in
my
bunk
with
the
brush
in
her
hand
and
all
her
hair
swept
over
one
shoulder
and
said
in
the
most
puzzled
way
what
was
that
nasty
thing
wilmot
was
saying
all
about
dead
women
and
do
you
know
what
she
objected
to
dear
dead
women
with
such
hair
too
what
become
of
all
the
gold
used
to
hang
and
brush
their
bosoms
i
feel
chilly
and
grown
old
we
are
very
much
worried
by
people
planting
themselves
beside
us
and
favouring
us
with
their
views
on
life
in
general
one
woman
rather
a
tiresome
person
a
spinster
with
a
curiously
face
and
large
teeth
sometimes
stays
for
hours
at
a
time
and
leaves
us
limp
even
gentle
wilmot
approaches
as
nearly
as
it
is
possible
for
her
to
approach
unkindness
in
her
comments
on
her
she
has
such
playful
girlish
manners
and
an
irritating
way
of
giving
vent
to
the
most
utter
platitudes
with
the
air
of
having
just
discovered
a
new
truth
she
has
been
with
us
this
morning
and
mentioned
that
her
father
was
four
times
removed
from
a
peerage
i
stifled
a
childish
desire
to
ask
who
had
removed
him
while
wilmot
murmured
how
interesting
as
she
minced
away
crawley
said
meditatively
the
rocking
horse
fly
and
with
a
squeal
of
delight
i
realized
that
that
was
what
she
had
always
vaguely
reminded
me
of
you
remember
the
insect
do
you
in
the
it
lived
on
sawdust
one
lesson
one
has
every
opportunity
of
learning
on
board
ship
is
to
suffer
fools
if
not
gladly
at
least
with
patience
the
curious
people
who
stray
across
one
path
one
woman
came
on
at
port
said
a
alone
can
you
imagine
anything
more
ghastly
she
is
very
tall
dark
and
and
last
night
when
and
i
were
in
the
music
saloon
before
dinner
she
sat
down
beside
us
and
began
to
talk
of
spiritualism
and
other
weird
things
to
bring
her
to
homelier
subjects
i
asked
if
she
liked
games
games
she
said
what
sort
of
games
i
can
ride
anything
that
has
four
legs
and
i
can
hold
my
own
with
a
sword
she
looked
so
fierce
that
if
the
bugle
sounded
at
that
moment
i
think
i
should
have
crept
under
a
table
quite
mad
said
placidly
as
we
left
her
we
are
going
to
have
a
dance
scotia
now
we
approach
a
conclusion
we
have
passed
colombo
and
in
three
or
four
days
ought
to
reach
calcutta
colombo
was
rather
nice
warm
and
green
and
moist
but
i
failed
to
detect
the
spicy
breeze
blowing
soft
ceylon
isle
that
the
hymn
led
me
to
expect
the
shops
are
good
and
full
of
interesting
things
like
small
ivory
elephants
silver
ornaments
bangles
kimonos
and
moonstones
we
bought
various
things
and
as
we
staggered
with
our
purchases
into
the
cabin
which
now
resembles
nothing
so
much
as
an
overcrowded
pawnshop
murray
remarked
we
are
on
speaking
terms
again
i
suppose
you
thought
the
cabin
looked
rather
empty
that
you
bought
so
much
rubbish
to
fill
it
up
we
were
dumb
under
the
deserved
rebuke
we
had
bought
her
a
fan
as
a
rather
a
pretty
one
too
but
she
thanked
us
with
no
enthusiasm
in
colombo
we
got
rickshaws
and
drove
out
to
the
galle
face
hotel
a
beautiful
place
with
the
surf
thundering
on
the
beach
outside
if
i
were
rich
i
would
always
ride
in
a
rickshaw
it
is
a
delightful
way
of
getting
about
and
as
we
were
trotted
along
a
fine
broad
road
small
brown
boys
ran
alongside
and
pelted
us
with
big
waxy
blossoms
we
did
enjoy
it
so
at
the
galle
face
in
a
cool
and
lofty
we
had
an
excellent
and
varied
breakfast
and
ate
real
proper
eastern
curry
for
the
first
time
another
new
experience
i
do
like
curry
at
home
curry
as
english
cooks
know
it
a
greasy
of
cold
joint
served
with
sodden
rice
but
this
was
different
first
rice
was
handed
round
every
particle
firm
and
separate
and
white
and
then
a
rich
brown
mixture
with
prawns
and
other
interesting
ingredients
which
was
the
curry
you
mix
the
curry
with
the
rice
when
a
whole
trayful
of
condiments
is
offered
to
eat
with
it
things
like
very
thin
water
biscuits
bombay
duck
all
sorts
of
chutney
and
when
you
have
mixed
everything
up
together
the
result
is
one
of
the
nicest
dishes
it
has
been
my
lot
to
taste
note
also
you
eat
it
with
a
fork
and
spoon
not
with
a
fork
alone
as
mere
provincials
do
i
begin
to
feel
so
excited
about
seeing
boggley
it
is
two
years
since
he
was
home
last
will
he
have
changed
much
i
wonder
there
was
a
letter
from
him
at
colombo
and
he
had
left
darjeeling
and
had
no
house
to
take
me
to
in
calcutta
so
it
would
appear
that
when
i
do
land
my
lodging
will
be
the
cold
ground
it
sounds
as
if
he
were
still
the
same
casual
old
boggley
who
began
that
name
john
i
think
he
had
two
names
for
him
and
and
in
time
we
all
slipped
into
calling
him
boggley
i
like
to
think
you
two
men
were
such
friends
at
oxford
long
before
i
knew
you
i
had
heard
many
tales
of
your
doings
and
i
think
that
was
one
reason
why
when
we
did
meet
we
liked
each
other
and
became
friends
because
we
were
both
so
fond
of
boggley
i
am
filled
with
qualms
as
to
whether
he
will
be
glad
to
see
me
it
must
be
rather
a
nuisance
in
lots
of
ways
to
have
a
sister
to
look
after
but
he
was
so
keen
that
i
should
come
that
surely
he
wo
think
me
a
bother
besides
when
you
think
of
it
it
was
really
very
good
of
me
to
leave
my
home
and
all
my
friends
and
brave
the
perils
of
the
deep
to
visit
a
brother
in
exile
i
wish
i
knew
exactly
when
we
shall
arrive
this
suspense
is
wearing
one
man
told
me
we
would
be
in
on
wednesday
another
said
we
would
miss
the
tide
and
not
be
in
till
saturday
i
asked
the
captain
but
he
directed
me
to
the
barber
who
he
said
knew
everything
and
indeed
there
are
very
few
things
he
does
know
he
is
a
dignified
figure
with
a
shiny
curl
on
his
forehead
and
a
rich
cockney
accent
full
of
information
generally
i
must
admit
strikingly
inaccurate
but
bestowed
with
such
an
air
i
do
believe
him
though
i
know
he
lies
we
are
in
the
hooghly
and
shall
be
in
kidderpore
dock
morning
early
actually
the
voyage
is
at
an
end
i
may
as
well
finish
this
letter
and
send
it
with
the
mail
which
leaves
calcutta
we
ca
pack
because
albert
murray
is
occupying
all
the
cabin
and
most
of
the
passage
we
shall
creep
down
when
she
is
quite
done
and
put
our
belongings
together
everyone
is
flying
about
writing
luggage
labels
and
getting
their
boxes
up
from
the
hold
and
counting
things
curiously
enough
i
am
feeling
rather
depressed
the
end
of
anything
is
horrid
even
a
loathed
after
all
it
is
a
bad
old
ship
and
the
people
have
been
nice
i
am
filled
with
kindness
to
everyone
even
albert
murray
seems
to
swim
in
a
rosy
and
golden
haze
and
i
am
conscious
of
quite
an
affection
for
her
though
i
expect
when
in
a
little
i
go
down
to
the
cabin
and
find
her
fussing
and
accusing
us
of
losing
her
things
i
shall
dislike
her
again
with
some
intensity
we
have
all
laughed
and
played
and
groaned
together
and
now
we
part
no
i
say
ships
that
pass
in
the
night
several
people
mothers
whose
babies
i
have
held
and
others
have
given
me
their
cards
and
a
cordial
invitation
to
go
and
stay
with
them
for
as
long
as
i
like
they
mean
it
now
i
know
but
in
a
month
time
shall
we
even
remember
each
other
names
it
will
be
a
real
grief
to
part
from
crawley
and
wilmot
the
dear
women
i
wish
they
had
been
going
to
stay
in
calcutta
but
they
go
straight
away
up
country
are
there
i
wonder
many
such
charming
women
in
india
it
seems
improbable
i
shall
miss
all
the
people
at
our
table
we
have
been
such
a
gay
company
major
wilmot
says
and
i
have
kept
them
all
amused
and
made
the
voyage
pleasant
but
that
is
only
his
kind
way
it
is
quite
true
though
what
crawley
says
of
she
is
like
a
great
rosy
apple
refreshing
and
sweet
and
wholesome
what
is
really
depressing
me
is
the
thought
that
wherever
i
am
night
there
will
be
no
to
say
my
dear
sleep
well
and
i
sha
be
able
to
drop
my
head
over
my
bunk
and
reply
my
dear
old
it
will
seem
so
odd
and
lonely
without
her
the
ship
has
stopped
we
are
to
anchor
here
till
daylight
fleshpots
of
calcutta
i
do
think
i
have
quite
realized
myself
or
my
surroundings
yet
but
one
thing
i
know
boggley
has
been
better
than
his
word
for
we
are
not
camping
in
a
corner
of
the
maidan
but
have
a
decent
roof
to
cover
us
but
i
shall
go
back
to
where
i
left
off
on
wednesday
night
we
spent
a
hot
breathless
night
in
the
river
towards
morning
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
that
the
ship
was
sinking
in
a
quicksand
and
that
i
in
trying
to
save
myself
had
stuck
fast
in
the
i
wakened
cold
with
fright
to
find
it
was
grey
dawn
and
they
were
getting
up
the
anchor
of
course
we
were
up
at
an
unearthly
hour
all
our
belongings
carefully
packed
and
labelled
ourselves
clad
in
clean
white
dresses
and
topis
to
face
the
burning
shining
face
of
india
there
was
little
to
see
and
nothing
to
do
and
we
walked
about
getting
hungrier
and
hungrier
and
yet
when
did
come
we
found
we
were
too
excited
to
eat
when
we
got
into
the
dock
we
saw
all
the
people
who
had
come
to
meet
us
penned
like
sheep
into
enclosures
and
we
leaned
over
the
side
trying
to
make
out
the
faces
of
friends
presently
they
were
allowed
to
come
on
board
and
i
eagerly
watching
spied
boggley
bounding
up
the
ladder
and
the
next
moment
we
were
clutching
each
other
wildly
but
our
greeting
what
it
is
to
be
scots
was
merely
hallo
there
you
are
i
need
not
have
worried
about
what
i
would
say
when
i
met
him
yes
i
was
silly
enough
to
do
that
for
he
is
just
the
same
dear
old
boggley
hair
as
red
eyes
as
blue
and
as
mouth
as
wide
as
ever
i
think
his
legs
are
even
longer
the
first
thing
he
did
when
he
came
on
board
was
to
fall
over
someone
and
that
made
us
both
laugh
helplessly
like
silly
children
i
introduced
him
to
and
the
others
and
by
this
time
had
found
her
sister
and
soon
they
were
all
talking
together
so
and
i
slipped
away
to
look
out
for
people
in
whom
we
were
interested
very
specially
did
we
want
to
see
albert
murray
and
when
we
did
see
him
he
was
almost
exactly
what
we
had
expected
small
his
topi
making
his
head
look
out
of
all
proportion
and
with
a
look
we
noticed
the
little
man
wandering
aimlessly
about
when
a
voice
from
the
door
saying
albert
made
him
start
visibly
and
turning
he
sidled
up
to
our
cabin
companion
who
kissed
him
severely
while
he
murmured
well
m
dear
how
are
you
seeing
us
standing
near
she
said
well
girls
i
hope
you
have
a
good
time
and
behave
yourselves
and
then
turning
to
her
husband
by
way
of
an
introduction
she
added
these
are
the
girls
who
shared
my
cabin
albert
shuffled
his
topi
and
looked
at
us
with
kind
blinking
eyes
but
attempted
no
remark
the
last
we
saw
of
him
he
was
tugging
the
in
the
wake
of
his
managing
wife
looked
at
me
solemnly
we
had
little
to
complain
of
she
said
we
married
to
her
the
husband
of
the
candle
was
the
greatest
surprise
i
had
imagined
why
i
do
know
that
that
lady
husband
would
be
tall
and
with
a
large
moustache
and
loud
voice
and
manner
someone
who
would
match
well
with
the
candle
instead
we
beheld
a
dark
man
with
a
stoop
a
man
who
looked
like
a
scholar
and
spoke
with
a
delightful
quiet
voice
he
addressed
the
candle
as
jane
if
it
had
been
fluffy
or
trixie
or
chippy
or
even
dolly
but
with
that
hair
that
complexion
that
voice
that
troop
of
attendant
swains
to
be
called
jane
the
thing
was
out
of
all
reason
i
wonder
all
the
widespread
family
of
janes
with
their
meek
eyes
and
smoothly
braided
hair
do
rise
up
and
call
her
anything
but
blessed
oh
i
know
there
was
no
thought
of
pleasing
me
when
she
was
christened
but
still
jane
it
was
rather
sweet
to
watch
the
little
family
groups
the
mother
assuring
a
bored
indifferent
infant
that
this
was
its
own
daddy
and
the
proud
father
beaming
on
both
the
bridegrooms
sidling
up
to
their
blushing
brides
afforded
us
much
amusement
some
had
not
seen
each
other
for
five
years
i
wonder
if
one
or
two
did
rue
their
bargains
it
seems
to
me
a
terrible
risk
i
could
have
gone
on
watching
the
people
for
a
long
time
but
boggley
was
anxious
to
be
off
so
after
tearful
farewells
and
many
promises
to
write
had
been
exchanged
we
departed
the
special
providence
that
looks
after
casual
people
has
guided
boggley
to
quite
a
nice
house
in
a
nice
part
of
the
town
many
government
people
who
are
in
calcutta
only
for
the
cold
weather
i
mean
those
of
them
who
are
burdened
not
with
wealth
but
find
it
cheaper
and
more
convenient
to
live
in
a
does
that
conjure
up
to
you
a
vision
of
bloomsbury
and
tall
grey
houses
and
dirty
and
the
passing
of
third
floor
backs
it
is
one
bit
like
that
this
consists
oddly
enough
of
four
big
houses
all
standing
a
little
distance
apart
in
a
compound
they
are
let
out
in
suites
of
rooms
and
the
occupants
can
either
all
feed
together
in
the
public
or
in
lonely
splendour
in
their
own
apartments
we
have
five
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
two
one
is
almost
quite
dark
and
is
inhabited
by
a
suite
of
furniture
three
tables
on
which
boggley
had
set
out
the
few
photographs
and
trifles
which
he
has
yet
lost
and
a
cabinet
the
other
opens
into
the
garden
and
is
a
nice
cheerful
room
the
dark
room
we
have
made
boggley
study
as
he
only
uses
it
at
night
it
does
matter
about
the
want
of
light
and
there
is
a
fine
large
which
holds
stacks
of
papers
we
got
the
tables
carried
into
the
cheery
room
and
covered
them
with
tablecloths
from
a
shop
in
park
street
bought
rugs
for
the
floor
and
hangings
for
the
doors
and
with
a
few
cushions
and
palms
and
flowers
the
room
is
quite
pretty
and
i
like
the
chairs
enormous
cane
things
with
long
wooden
arms
which
boggley
says
are
meant
for
putting
one
feet
on
and
most
comfortable
boggley
bedroom
is
next
his
study
but
i
have
to
take
a
walk
before
i
come
to
mine
out
of
the
window
or
door
i
never
sure
which
it
is
down
some
steps
then
along
a
round
a
corner
and
up
some
more
steps
where
i
reach
first
a
small
and
then
my
bedroom
like
the
other
rooms
it
is
whitewashed
and
has
a
very
high
ceiling
some
confiding
sparrows
have
built
a
nest
in
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
and
this
is
really
upsetting
there
are
different
ways
of
entering
the
room
doors
and
windows
and
half
of
them
i
lock
or
bar
or
fasten
up
in
any
way
what
i
should
do
if
a
mutiny
occurred
i
ca
think
my
bed
with
its
stands
like
a
little
island
in
a
vast
sea
of
matting
and
there
are
two
large
wardrobes
what
they
call
a
and
two
chairs
it
is
empty
and
airy
and
that
is
all
that
is
required
of
a
bedroom
the
four
houses
as
i
told
you
stand
in
a
compound
it
is
exactly
a
garden
for
there
are
lots
of
things
in
it
that
we
would
consider
quite
superfluous
in
a
garden
there
is
a
good
tennis
lawn
plots
of
flowers
walks
bordered
with
poinsettias
and
trees
with
white
flowers
and
opposite
my
bedroom
is
a
little
enclosure
where
two
cows
and
two
calves
lead
a
calm
and
meditative
existence
and
further
there
are
funny
little
huts
scattered
about
where
one
catches
glimpses
of
natives
at
their
devotions
or
slumbering
peacefully
imagine
in
the
middle
of
a
garden
at
home
coming
on
a
cowhouse
or
a
shanty
but
this
is
india
boggley
conducted
me
round
both
of
us
talking
hard
all
the
time
he
had
so
many
questions
to
ask
and
i
had
so
much
to
tell
all
the
home
news
and
silly
little
home
jokes
peter
latest
sayings
things
that
are
so
amusing
to
tell
and
to
hear
but
lose
all
their
flavour
written
you
remember
boggley
wild
bursts
of
laughter
he
laughs
just
the
same
now
throws
his
head
back
and
shouts
in
the
most
way
we
talked
from
till
without
a
break
talked
ourselves
hoarse
and
thirsty
after
tea
we
drove
on
the
maidan
up
and
down
the
red
road
in
an
unending
stream
of
carriages
and
motors
shabby
and
smart
little
dogcarts
called
here
all
calcutta
taking
the
air
one
might
almost
have
imagined
oneself
in
the
park
if
it
had
not
been
that
now
and
again
a
strange
equipage
would
pass
filled
with
natives
men
and
boys
gorgeous
in
purple
and
scarlet
and
gold
or
closed
carriages
like
boxes
on
wheels
in
which
sat
women
demurely
veiled
from
the
red
road
we
drove
to
the
strand
a
by
the
river
where
the
great
ships
lie
and
watched
the
sun
set
and
the
spars
and
masts
become
silhouetted
against
the
red
sky
then
darkness
fell
almost
at
once
my
mind
was
a
chaos
when
i
went
to
bed
after
my
first
day
in
india
and
i
slept
so
soundly
that
when
i
woke
i
had
no
idea
where
i
was
all
of
the
voyage
and
arrival
were
wiped
from
my
memory
and
i
was
filled
first
with
vague
astonishment
and
then
with
horror
to
find
myself
surrounded
by
filmy
white
stuff
through
which
peered
a
black
face
it
was
only
my
a
quaint
small
person
wrapped
in
a
white
with
demure
sly
eyes
and
teeth
stained
red
with
chewing
looking
through
the
to
see
if
the
miss
sahib
was
awake
and
would
like
she
embarrasses
me
greatly
slipping
about
with
her
bare
feet
appearing
when
i
least
expect
her
or
squatting
on
the
floor
staring
at
me
fixedly
i
know
no
hindustani
and
she
knows
perhaps
three
english
words
so
our
conversation
is
limited
the
silence
gets
so
on
my
nerves
that
i
drop
hairbrushes
and
things
to
make
a
little
disturbance
and
it
gives
her
something
to
do
to
pick
them
up
i
must
at
once
learn
some
hindustani
words
such
as
pink
blue
and
green
and
then
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
bella
what
dress
to
lay
out
and
her
place
wo
be
such
a
sinecure
i
call
her
bella
because
it
is
the
nearest
i
can
get
to
her
name
and
it
has
a
homely
sound
the
rest
of
my
impressions
i
shall
keep
for
my
next
letter
i
have
written
this
much
to
give
you
an
idea
of
my
surroundings
and
you
see
i
have
taken
your
interest
for
granted
are
you
bored
of
course
you
will
say
you
are
not
but
if
i
could
see
your
face
i
should
know
the
home
mail
arrives
here
on
sunday
when
people
are
having
what
they
call
a
europe
morning
and
have
time
to
read
and
enjoy
their
letters
when
you
wrote
you
had
just
had
my
mail
from
marseilles
how
far
behind
you
are
it
was
too
bad
of
me
to
write
such
pitiful
letters
but
i
think
i
was
too
miserable
to
pretend
now
i
am
very
well
off
and
no
one
could
be
more
utterly
thoughtful
and
kind
than
old
boggley
i
am
sure
i
shall
never
regret
coming
to
india
and
it
will
be
something
to
dream
about
when
i
am
a
douce
you
speak
of
rain
and
mud
and
fog
and
it
all
seems
very
far
away
from
this
afternoon
land
the
winter
will
soon
pass
and
as
you
nicely
put
it
i
shall
return
with
the
spring
it
is
the
witching
hour
of
and
i
am
sitting
in
my
little
boudoir
call
it
what
you
will
immersed
in
correspondence
boggley
man
that
he
is
has
departed
for
his
office
followed
by
a
carrying
some
sandwiches
and
a
bottle
of
which
is
his
modest
lunch
really
a
government
life
is
no
easy
one
he
is
up
every
morning
by
six
and
gets
a
couple
of
hours
work
done
before
breakfast
his
office
receives
him
at
ten
and
keeps
him
till
four
when
he
comes
home
and
has
tea
after
which
we
ride
or
drive
or
play
tennis
somewhere
a
look
in
at
the
club
for
a
game
of
billiards
more
work
dinner
and
if
we
are
not
going
to
a
dance
or
any
frivolity
a
quiet
talk
a
smoke
a
few
more
papers
gone
through
bed
and
the
long
indian
day
is
over
all
day
like
attendant
angels
flit
in
and
out
bearing
piles
of
documents
marked
urgent
which
they
heap
on
his
i
begin
greatly
to
dislike
the
sight
of
them
so
you
see
i
have
of
necessity
many
hours
alone
at
least
i
have
some
and
i
would
have
more
if
did
live
within
a
few
minutes
walk
and
every
morning
armed
with
a
large
parasol
and
protected
by
her
faithful
topi
come
round
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
me
her
sister
townley
is
a
very
nice
woman
and
kindness
itself
to
me
i
can
say
like
the
psalmist
that
goodness
and
mercy
follow
me
i
started
from
london
knowing
no
one
yet
in
hours
i
was
fast
friends
with
and
afterwards
with
quite
a
lot
of
people
on
board
i
thought
when
i
landed
in
calcutta
i
would
be
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
and
have
no
one
but
boggley
instead
of
which
i
have
quite
near
and
townley
says
i
must
come
to
them
any
minute
of
the
day
i
want
to
and
there
are
others
equally
kind
you
do
want
me
to
give
you
a
detailed
account
of
calcutta
do
you
it
would
interest
you
to
read
it
and
it
certainly
interest
me
to
write
it
when
my
friends
go
wandering
and
write
me
home
long
descriptions
of
the
places
of
interest
falsely
so
called
which
they
visit
i
read
them
oh
i
read
them
faithfully
but
i
am
sadly
bored
somehow
people
interest
me
more
than
places
that
being
so
i
shall
only
inflict
on
you
a
little
of
calcutta
i
like
it
immensely
they
laugh
at
me
for
saying
it
is
pretty
but
i
do
think
it
is
quite
beautiful
it
is
so
much
greener
than
i
expected
and
i
like
the
broad
streets
of
pillared
houses
standing
in
their
compounds
the
principal
street
is
called
chowringhee
and
it
has
some
fine
buildings
and
really
excellent
shops
where
one
can
buy
quite
as
pretty
things
as
in
london
only
of
course
they
are
of
necessity
more
expensive
it
costs
a
lot
to
bring
them
out
the
clubs
are
in
this
street
the
bengal
club
and
the
united
service
where
my
brother
would
even
now
be
leading
a
comfortable
bachelor
existence
if
he
had
had
a
bothering
sister
to
provide
a
habitation
for
chowringhee
faces
the
maidan
a
very
large
park
containing
among
other
things
a
and
cricket
and
football
grounds
the
word
maidan
is
arabic
and
persian
and
hindustani
for
an
open
space
and
i
hope
you
like
the
superior
way
i
explain
things
to
you
you
who
can
be
silent
in
so
many
languages
will
probably
know
what
maidan
means
but
no
matter
this
then
is
the
european
calcutta
clean
and
spacious
and
pleasant
but
not
nearly
so
interesting
as
the
native
part
turn
down
a
side
street
walk
a
little
way
and
you
are
in
a
nest
of
mean
streets
unpaved
dirty
smelling
vilely
lined
with
open
booths
where
squat
men
selling
lumps
of
sticky
sweetmeats
and
piles
of
things
that
look
like
unbaked
scones
and
other
strange
eatables
and
little
naked
babies
tumble
in
the
dust
with
goats
and
puppies
it
seems
to
me
that
i
go
about
asking
why
all
day
and
no
one
gives
me
a
satisfactory
answer
to
anything
why
for
example
should
we
require
a
troop
of
servants
living
as
we
do
in
a
kind
of
hotel
and
yet
there
they
are
boggley
bearer
and
my
i
can
see
some
reason
for
their
presence
a
to
wait
on
us
at
table
and
bring
tea
in
the
afternoon
another
young
assistant
who
scurries
like
a
frightened
rabbit
at
my
approach
a
delightful
small
boy
who
rejoices
in
the
name
of
whose
sole
duty
is
to
carry
water
for
the
baths
the
who
washes
our
clothes
by
beating
them
between
two
large
and
i
should
say
judging
by
the
state
of
the
clothes
sharp
stones
losing
most
of
them
in
the
process
and
a
or
groom
for
each
pony
seated
as
one
sometimes
sees
them
in
rows
on
the
steps
augmented
by
a
or
two
brilliant
in
uniform
they
make
a
sufficiently
imposing
spectacle
i
have
few
words
but
i
look
at
them
in
as
pleasant
a
way
as
i
know
how
partly
because
i
like
to
be
friends
with
servants
and
partly
because
i
rather
afraid
of
them
and
do
want
to
rouse
them
to
mutiny
or
do
anything
desperate
but
boggley
discouraged
me
at
the
outset
you
need
grin
at
them
so
affably
he
remarked
they
will
only
think
you
are
weak
in
the
head
they
quite
evidently
regard
me
as
a
poor
creature
even
bella
though
she
humours
me
and
condescends
to
say
pretty
pretty
or
nicey
nicey
when
i
am
dressed
in
the
evening
i
think
she
must
once
have
nursed
children
for
the
words
she
knows
are
baby
words
she
always
calls
me
poor
missy
baba
and
strokes
me
the
finds
amusement
in
practising
his
english
on
me
when
he
sees
come
through
the
compound
he
bounds
to
my
room
holds
up
the
and
announcing
mees
come
retires
stiff
with
pride
at
his
knowledge
of
the
language
i
have
learned
a
few
useful
hindustani
words
means
roughly
is
anyone
there
and
you
cry
that
instead
of
ringing
a
bell
and
it
brings
the
instant
response
and
a
servant
springs
from
nowhere
to
do
your
bidding
means
bring
and
go
you
never
say
please
and
you
learn
the
words
in
a
cross
tone
that
is
if
you
want
to
be
really
radical
of
course
will
learn
please
at
once
if
there
is
such
a
word
in
the
language
which
i
doubt
one
nice
old
lady
anxious
like
me
to
conciliate
the
natives
was
having
a
cup
of
chocolate
at
peliti
and
she
insisted
on
sending
out
to
see
if
the
would
like
a
cup
a
is
a
thing
like
a
victoria
hired
by
the
hour
there
are
first
second
and
third
class
the
first
class
have
two
horses
the
second
one
horse
and
the
third
is
closed
and
having
no
springs
is
a
terrible
vehicle
indeed
the
drivers
of
these
carriages
have
as
a
rule
long
whiskers
and
are
dressed
in
khaki
they
have
bags
of
provender
for
the
horses
tied
behind
the
conveyance
where
also
precariously
hangs
another
man
who
might
be
the
of
the
driver
i
do
know
why
he
is
there
but
there
he
is
and
i
love
to
set
out
in
a
and
practise
our
hindustani
starting
early
when
it
is
fairly
cool
indian
cold
weather
mornings
are
the
most
wonderful
things
so
fresh
and
so
bright
and
so
blue
starts
us
off
at
a
mad
gallop
by
shouting
which
i
have
to
calm
down
with
slower
when
we
reach
we
cry
stop
and
get
out
to
buy
caramels
chocolates
and
cakes
for
tea
peliti
has
a
peculiarly
delicious
kind
of
chocolate
cake
the
recipe
for
which
i
wish
he
would
confide
to
fuller
or
buszard
but
it
is
the
european
shops
good
as
they
are
that
occupy
our
mornings
much
more
fascinating
haunts
await
us
the
new
market
and
the
china
bazaar
the
former
is
a
kind
of
arcade
which
contains
everything
that
any
reasonable
person
could
require
fragrant
fruit
and
flowers
vegetables
and
the
wares
of
butcher
and
baker
and
all
laid
out
on
booths
and
stalls
for
the
world
to
choose
from
there
very
early
in
the
morning
come
the
of
the
various
and
buy
all
that
is
needed
for
the
day
while
the
are
cosy
in
bed
needing
not
to
worry
about
house
visitors
or
forthcoming
housekeeping
is
easy
in
india
boggley
thought
we
had
better
ask
some
people
to
dinner
so
we
did
though
i
pointed
out
that
we
had
no
silver
or
anything
to
make
the
table
decent
and
the
things
are
none
too
dainty
it
be
all
right
said
boggley
leave
it
to
the
servants
so
i
engaged
the
private
and
left
it
i
rather
trembled
when
the
evening
came
and
our
party
walked
in
but
i
need
have
the
servants
were
worthy
of
their
trust
the
table
looked
charming
and
as
i
had
never
seen
any
of
the
things
before
i
had
a
more
interesting
time
than
usually
falls
to
the
hostess
what
i
sincerely
hoped
was
that
none
of
the
guests
had
seen
any
of
the
things
before
either
but
if
they
had
they
possessed
great
control
of
their
countenances
eatables
however
are
by
no
means
the
only
things
to
be
found
in
the
new
market
silks
muslins
silver
ornaments
and
jewellery
keep
us
breathless
while
the
pleasant
shopman
in
a
and
turban
offers
them
at
what
he
calls
killin
prices
the
china
bazaar
is
much
farther
into
the
city
quite
in
the
native
quarter
it
is
a
real
adventure
to
make
an
expedition
there
and
the
owners
allow
us
to
poke
in
back
rooms
from
which
we
unearth
wondrous
treasures
in
the
way
of
old
brass
vases
queer
still
faintly
smelling
of
roses
old
lacquer
boxes
and
bits
of
rich
embroidery
i
am
becoming
a
shylock
in
the
way
i
beat
down
prices
i
should
wonder
a
bit
when
i
go
home
and
am
ruffling
it
once
more
in
bond
street
if
when
told
the
price
of
a
thing
is
a
guinea
i
laugh
in
a
jocular
way
and
say
oh
come
now
i
give
you
ten
shillings
but
to
return
to
hindustani
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
i
can
ask
for
beef
which
is
cold
beef
just
as
is
cold
water
being
hot
i
can
order
what
i
want
at
meals
at
first
when
i
wanted
boiled
eggs
and
heard
boggley
order
i
remonstrated
not
until
it
was
explained
to
me
that
meant
egg
the
native
ca
say
any
word
beginning
with
s
without
putting
a
before
it
thus
beef
when
men
come
to
see
us
i
cry
hai
and
when
the
servant
appears
order
lao
cheroot
and
feel
intensely
and
rather
fast
one
trait
the
language
has
which
appeals
greatly
to
me
is
that
one
can
spell
it
almost
any
way
one
likes
but
that
is
enough
about
hindustani
for
one
letter
i
have
come
in
from
a
ride
with
boggley
the
proper
time
to
ride
is
early
morning
but
i
am
too
lazy
and
too
timid
to
go
when
the
place
is
crowded
and
so
we
ride
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
when
we
have
the
almost
to
ourselves
i
ride
one
of
boggley
polo
ponies
solomon
by
name
boggley
says
he
is
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
but
i
am
not
sure
that
he
is
speaking
the
strict
truth
he
has
some
nasty
little
ways
it
seems
to
me
he
bites
for
one
thing
we
were
riding
with
a
man
the
other
night
and
quite
suddenly
his
pony
got
up
in
the
air
and
nearly
threw
him
had
bitten
the
man
looked
at
me
as
if
it
were
my
fault
and
i
regret
to
say
i
laughed
he
has
also
an
ungentlemanly
way
of
trying
to
rub
me
off
against
the
railings
and
then
again
for
no
apparent
reason
he
suddenly
scurries
wildly
across
the
maidan
while
i
pull
desperately
but
impotently
with
fingers
weak
from
fright
boggley
coming
behind
convulsed
with
laughter
merely
remarks
that
i
am
a
which
i
take
it
means
the
worst
kind
of
coward
think
where
i
have
been
for
the
last
three
days
down
the
river
in
a
launch
that
kind
townley
was
taking
and
asked
boggley
if
i
might
go
we
had
to
leave
on
saturday
morning
before
seven
to
catch
the
tide
so
i
warned
bella
that
she
must
bring
my
before
six
but
i
woke
and
found
it
was
after
six
and
there
were
no
signs
of
the
perfidious
little
black
bella
i
nearly
ready
when
rushed
in
but
i
threw
on
garments
and
we
fled
while
boggley
in
his
followed
with
a
parting
benediction
of
peliti
cake
as
a
substitute
for
tea
and
toast
we
found
the
launch
delightfully
comfortable
not
to
say
luxurious
it
had
been
done
up
for
some
of
the
royalties
who
were
out
here
there
were
only
we
three
on
board
and
three
young
sailor
men
so
it
was
a
blessedly
peaceful
three
days
we
lay
on
deck
and
watched
the
life
of
the
river
all
the
ships
big
ships
from
dundee
and
greenock
german
ships
french
ships
every
kind
and
nationality
of
ships
down
to
the
curious
native
craft
sometimes
we
passed
a
little
village
on
the
with
a
temple
and
an
idol
on
a
mound
when
we
anchored
in
the
afternoon
two
of
the
officers
went
on
shore
to
shoot
and
the
sailors
let
down
a
net
and
caught
delicious
fish
for
dinner
i
did
wish
peter
had
been
there
he
would
have
felt
like
robinson
crusoe
and
rejoiced
in
it
all
at
dinner
the
young
men
told
us
wonderful
stories
of
their
adventures
with
snakes
and
tigers
one
man
said
that
he
was
having
his
bath
one
morning
when
a
snake
came
up
the
pipe
when
it
saw
him
it
went
down
again
but
as
it
was
disappearing
he
pulled
it
back
by
its
tail
again
it
tried
to
go
down
and
again
he
pulled
it
back
and
then
the
snake
took
a
look
at
him
and
went
down
tail
first
i
believed
every
word
but
when
i
came
home
and
related
the
amazing
tales
to
boggley
he
received
them
with
derisive
shouts
of
laughter
and
said
they
had
been
spinning
us
sailors
yarns
the
mail
was
waiting
here
when
i
came
back
yesterday
thanks
so
much
for
your
letter
i
am
immensely
interested
in
all
your
news
but
i
have
left
myself
no
time
to
answer
you
properly
as
this
must
be
posted
the
two
queerest
things
i
have
noticed
in
calcutta
up
to
now
are
that
when
a
man
goes
out
to
tennis
and
stays
to
dinner
his
bearer
carries
his
in
a
kippered
herrings
come
to
the
table
up
in
i
do
think
i
like
this
casting
of
bread
upon
the
water
i
never
know
which
loaf
it
is
i
am
receiving
again
you
reply
to
things
i
had
forgotten
i
had
written
and
it
is
rather
bewildering
when
you
get
this
you
will
be
settled
down
in
germany
i
am
sorry
you
have
left
london
for
one
reason
and
that
a
purely
selfish
one
i
sha
be
able
to
imagine
you
in
your
new
surroundings
and
in
london
i
knew
pretty
well
what
you
would
be
doing
every
minute
of
the
day
knowing
as
we
do
many
of
the
same
people
when
you
wrote
i
have
been
dining
with
the
to
meet
the
i
could
picture
it
all
even
to
little
attitudes
i
was
only
in
germany
once
for
three
days
and
i
came
away
with
an
impression
of
a
country
weird
as
to
food
feathery
as
to
beds
and
crammed
full
of
soldiers
but
i
dare
say
it
is
a
very
good
place
to
write
a
book
and
now
my
heartiest
congratulations
on
having
a
book
to
write
it
sounds
pardon
me
for
saying
it
a
very
dull
subject
but
if
i
were
a
little
wiser
i
expect
i
should
see
how
important
it
is
and
anyway
i
have
enough
sense
to
perceive
that
it
is
a
great
compliment
to
be
asked
to
write
it
what
fun
to
be
a
man
and
have
a
career
in
my
more
exalted
moments
it
is
sometimes
borne
in
on
me
that
i
should
have
been
a
man
and
a
diplomatist
i
feel
though
i
admit
with
no
grounds
to
speak
of
that
i
might
have
been
a
great
success
in
that
most
interesting
profession
one
never
knows
and
by
putting
my
foot
in
it
very
conscientiously
all
round
i
might
have
earned
for
myself
a
reputation
of
machiavellian
cunning
what
do
you
think
i
met
at
dinner
last
night
a
travelling
radical
member
of
parliament
of
course
i
had
read
of
them
often
and
knew
exactly
what
sort
of
creatures
they
are
fearful
wild
fowl
who
come
to
india
for
six
weeks
comprehend
in
half
a
what
it
takes
a
man
ten
years
or
so
to
know
that
he
will
never
know
tell
the
native
they
want
to
be
a
brother
to
him
and
go
home
to
write
a
book
about
the
way
india
is
misgoverned
i
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
one
quite
close
at
hand
i
pictured
a
strong
still
man
with
a
beard
soft
fat
hands
and
a
sob
in
his
voice
that
at
election
times
would
touch
the
great
deep
throbbing
heart
of
the
people
instead
i
beheld
a
small
thin
man
with
eyes
as
tired
as
any
of
the
poor
bureaucrats
and
a
wide
mouth
with
a
humorous
twitch
at
the
corners
a
man
one
imagine
wanting
to
touch
anything
so
silly
as
the
heart
of
the
people
he
talked
i
noticed
very
little
during
dinner
but
the
men
were
unusually
long
in
joining
us
afterwards
and
as
boggley
clambered
after
me
into
the
that
was
to
take
us
home
that
a
ripping
fellow
said
boggley
another
illusion
shattered
i
hasten
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
on
one
point
i
have
a
chaperon
and
a
very
nice
though
entirely
unnecessary
one
her
name
is
victor
ormonde
and
she
knows
my
people
at
home
that
is
why
she
bothers
with
me
she
is
a
most
attractive
woman
to
look
at
tall
dark
and
slender
with
the
dearest
little
nose
which
makes
her
look
rather
impertinent
and
she
is
a
little
inclined
to
be
sniffy
to
some
people
she
considers
calcutta
women
suburban
her
husband
is
quite
different
friends
with
everyone
a
cheerful
soul
and
as
irish
as
he
can
be
he
is
very
fond
of
chaffing
his
exclusive
wife
now
do
be
affable
he
implored
her
the
other
night
before
they
went
to
a
large
and
somewhat
mixed
gathering
and
was
she
affable
i
asked
next
morning
oh
rollin
about
on
the
floor
was
the
obviously
untrue
reply
you
ask
how
i
like
the
women
and
i
do
know
quite
what
to
say
it
is
the
old
story
when
they
are
nice
they
are
very
very
nice
but
when
they
are
nasty
they
are
some
of
them
i
simply
hate
they
give
me
such
nasty
little
stabs
the
while
they
smile
and
pretend
to
be
pleasant
i
am
quite
capable
of
giving
back
as
good
as
i
get
but
it
is
worth
while
because
if
one
does
yield
to
the
temptation
afterwards
one
feels
such
a
worm
there
is
no
doubt
it
is
more
difficult
in
india
than
at
home
to
obey
the
command
of
one
childhood
to
behave
pretty
and
be
a
lady
what
is
a
lady
exactly
i
used
to
be
told
that
a
lady
was
one
who
always
said
please
when
asking
for
more
and
who
never
bit
the
fingers
of
her
gloves
that
was
simple
and
what
i
be
if
i
not
a
lady
i
asked
you
be
common
said
the
nurse
severely
and
then
and
there
because
snatched
was
sweet
and
gloves
chewed
in
secret
pleasant
i
registered
a
vow
that
common
i
would
be
a
dear
little
lady
i
met
the
other
day
talking
about
her
sister
said
airily
of
course
we
very
soon
lose
complexions
manners
and
morals
she
could
afford
to
say
so
it
being
so
obviously
untrue
in
her
case
i
think
it
is
just
this
that
the
women
who
are
pure
gold
grow
more
charming
but
the
wears
off
very
soon
the
eastern
sun
reveals
blemishes
moral
and
physical
that
would
pass
unnoticed
in
the
murkier
atmosphere
of
england
the
wonder
to
me
is
that
anyone
keeps
nice
when
one
thinks
of
the
provocation
there
is
to
deteriorate
the
climate
the
lack
of
any
serious
occupation
to
take
up
their
days
the
constant
round
of
gaieties
indulged
in
partly
i
believe
to
keep
themselves
from
thinking
the
anxiety
about
the
children
at
home
oh
there
is
much
one
could
say
if
one
held
a
brief
for
the
women
calcutta
society
is
made
up
of
government
people
army
people
and
business
people
who
are
called
for
some
unknown
reason
it
seems
very
strange
that
there
should
be
such
a
desire
to
go
one
better
than
one
neighbour
to
have
better
horses
a
smarter
carriage
a
larger
house
smarter
gowns
because
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
civil
service
people
their
income
is
known
down
to
the
last
rupee
everybody
in
india
is
more
or
less
somebody
it
must
be
a
very
sad
change
to
go
home
to
england
and
be
comparatively
poor
and
shabby
and
certainly
obscure
to
have
people
remark
vaguely
they
suppose
you
are
something
in
india
i
suppose
we
are
all
snobs
at
heart
snobbery
sir
doth
walk
about
the
orb
like
the
sun
it
shines
everywhere
a
good
lady
talked
to
me
quite
seriously
lately
about
what
the
best
people
in
calcutta
did
it
has
become
a
light
table
joke
with
us
and
when
i
plant
my
elbows
on
the
table
and
hum
a
tune
while
we
are
waiting
for
the
next
course
at
dinner
boggley
mildly
inquires
do
the
best
people
do
that
it
is
a
subject
i
never
gave
much
attention
to
but
now
awful
doubts
assail
me
am
i
the
best
people
one
thing
is
certain
i
am
of
very
little
importance
i
am
only
a
miss
sahib
and
my
is
my
great
protection
no
one
is
going
to
bother
much
what
i
do
or
trouble
to
pull
my
clothes
and
my
conduct
to
pieces
and
i
can
creep
along
unnoticed
to
a
great
extent
i
watch
the
game
and
find
it
vastly
entertaining
it
grieves
me
to
say
that
i
am
one
of
the
class
who
ought
to
remain
in
england
there
i
am
quite
a
nice
person
up
to
my
lights
fairly
unselfish
loving
my
neighbour
as
myself
but
i
have
proved
myself
pinchbeck
no
you
need
say
i
sweet
i
not
i
find
myself
saying
the
most
detestable
things
about
people
oblivious
of
the
beam
in
my
own
eye
i
stare
fixedly
and
reprovingly
at
the
mote
in
my
neighbour
could
anything
be
more
unlovable
i
get
no
encouragement
to
be
a
cat
from
boggley
everyone
is
his
very
good
friend
wright
called
i
remark
at
tea
did
she
says
boggley
she
a
nice
little
woman
you
like
her
she
makes
up
i
say
and
she
had
on
a
most
ridiculous
hat
brodie
says
she
a
dreadful
flirt
rubbish
says
boggley
she
a
very
good
sort
and
devoted
to
her
husband
brodie
says
i
continue
that
she
is
horrid
to
other
women
and
tries
to
take
away
their
husbands
it
odd
how
fond
women
are
of
other
people
husbands
much
odder
boggley
retorts
that
you
should
have
become
such
a
little
backbiting
cat
you
soon
be
as
bad
as
old
mother
brodie
and
the
worst
in
calcutta
this
is
the
christmas
mail
and
i
have
written
sixteen
letters
but
i
ca
send
presents
except
to
mother
and
some
girls
for
i
seen
a
single
thing
suitable
for
a
man
poor
peter
wailed
for
a
monkey
or
a
mongoose
but
i
told
him
to
wait
till
i
came
home
and
i
would
do
my
best
to
bring
one
or
both
i
can
only
send
you
greetings
from
a
far
country
you
know
you
will
never
be
better
than
i
wish
you
dear
oliver
twist
i
really
do
think
i
can
write
longer
letters
they
seem
to
me
very
long
indeed
i
am
not
ashamed
of
their
length
but
i
am
ashamed
especially
when
i
read
yours
of
their
dullness
and
of
the
attempt
at
description
how
is
it
that
you
can
make
your
little
german
town
fascinating
when
i
can
only
make
this
vast
stupefying
india
sound
dull
it
would
sound
dull
if
i
were
telling
you
about
it
by
word
of
mouth
i
could
make
you
see
it
then
but
what
can
a
poor
uninspired
one
do
with
a
pen
some
ink
and
a
sheet
of
paper
i
have
been
employing
a
shining
hour
by
paying
calls
you
must
know
that
in
india
the
new
arrival
does
not
sit
and
wait
to
be
called
on
she
up
and
calls
first
it
is
quite
simple
you
call
your
carriage
or
if
you
have
aspired
to
a
carriage
the
humble
useful
and
drive
away
to
the
first
house
on
the
list
where
you
ask
the
at
the
gate
for
if
the
lady
is
not
receiving
he
brings
out
a
wooden
box
with
the
inscription
not
at
home
you
drop
in
your
cards
and
drive
on
to
the
next
if
the
box
is
not
out
then
the
taking
the
cards
goes
in
to
ask
if
his
mistress
is
receiving
and
comes
back
with
her
salaams
and
that
means
that
one
has
to
go
in
for
a
few
minutes
but
it
does
often
happen
the
funny
part
of
it
is
one
may
have
hundreds
of
people
on
one
visiting
list
and
not
know
half
of
them
by
sight
because
of
the
convenient
system
of
the
box
the
men
is
sunday
between
twelve
and
two
such
a
ridiculous
time
one
is
certainly
not
at
one
best
at
that
hour
is
it
the
irish
who
talks
of
that
blank
time
of
day
when
breakfast
has
died
within
one
and
lunch
is
not
yet
i
find
it
on
the
whole
entertaining
though
somewhat
trying
for
boggley
you
see
has
to
be
out
paying
calls
on
his
own
account
and
so
i
have
to
receive
my
visitors
alone
it
is
quite
like
a
game
a
servant
comes
in
and
presents
me
with
a
card
inscribed
with
a
name
unfamiliar
and
i
saying
something
that
sounds
like
salaam
do
wait
breathless
for
what
may
appear
a
man
comes
in
we
converse
i
begin
where
will
you
sit
as
there
are
only
four
chairs
in
the
room
the
choice
is
not
extensive
the
man
seated
and
twirling
his
hat
you
have
just
come
out
myself
yes
in
the
remarks
follow
about
the
voyage
the
man
what
do
you
think
of
india
myself
oh
rather
nice
do
you
think
the
man
oh
quite
a
decent
place
what
again
the
servant
appears
this
time
with
two
cards
again
i
murmur
the
open
sesame
and
two
more
men
appear
no
gets
up
to
go
shakes
hands
with
me
in
a
detached
way
and
departs
and
the
same
conversation
begins
again
with
the
until
they
in
their
turn
leave
when
someone
else
comes
in
it
seems
to
be
etiquette
to
go
away
whenever
another
visitor
arrives
i
did
understand
this
and
when
a
man
came
whom
i
knew
well
in
my
childhood
days
and
after
a
few
minutes
stay
got
up
to
depart
i
grabbed
his
hand
and
said
oh
wo
you
stay
and
have
a
talk
he
very
nicely
stayed
on
and
we
did
have
a
delightful
talk
but
victor
ormonde
who
happened
to
be
present
has
never
ceased
to
chaff
me
about
it
when
we
dine
with
them
and
get
up
to
go
he
says
in
thrilling
accents
with
an
absurdly
sentimental
air
oh
you
stay
and
have
a
talk
i
do
think
india
makes
very
nice
men
almost
every
man
i
have
met
has
been
delightful
in
his
own
way
i
had
just
written
that
last
sentence
when
a
servant
brought
in
a
card
inscribed
colonel
simpson
i
got
my
sunshade
and
walked
round
to
my
where
i
found
a
tall
man
thinking
he
must
be
a
friend
of
boggley
i
held
out
my
hand
frankly
and
having
shaken
it
the
man
went
on
holding
it
like
captain
hook
i
murmured
to
myself
this
is
unusual
but
i
tried
to
conceal
my
astonishment
and
we
sat
down
together
on
the
sofa
then
he
began
to
my
by
this
time
i
had
made
up
my
mind
he
must
be
a
lunatic
and
i
had
a
wild
idea
of
snatching
away
my
hand
and
making
a
bound
for
the
window
but
feeling
that
my
legs
were
too
weak
with
fright
to
be
of
any
real
use
to
me
i
remained
seated
are
you
sick
he
asked
not
in
the
least
thank
you
i
stammered
a
doubtful
look
flickered
over
his
pensive
countenance
are
you
not
my
patient
he
asked
no
i
answered
truthfully
but
i
was
sent
for
to
a
woodward
this
was
the
address
and
i
was
shown
in
here
he
was
so
upset
that
i
hastened
to
assure
him
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
that
woodward
lived
above
us
and
it
was
quite
quite
all
right
but
my
comforting
protestations
profited
nothing
and
the
poor
man
retired
in
great
confusion
murmuring
incoherently
if
i
had
seen
doctor
on
his
card
i
might
have
been
prepared
but
who
would
expect
a
colonel
to
be
a
doctor
this
confusing
india
this
has
been
a
queer
day
nothing
but
alarums
and
excursions
came
to
tea
and
suggested
that
afterwards
we
should
go
for
a
drive
in
a
it
being
a
more
amusing
mode
of
conveyance
in
g
eyes
than
her
sister
elegant
carriage
so
we
drove
up
and
down
the
red
road
and
along
the
strand
until
the
darkness
came
it
rained
this
morning
the
first
rain
i
have
seen
in
this
dusty
land
making
the
roads
quite
muddy
and
the
air
damp
and
cold
it
like
an
evening
in
england
said
let
get
out
and
walk
home
so
we
told
the
driver
to
and
who
had
the
money
to
pay
him
in
her
hand
got
out
first
at
least
i
thought
she
was
out
but
she
had
paused
balanced
on
the
step
and
my
slight
push
knocked
her
headlong
how
she
did
it
i
do
know
but
her
feet
remained
in
the
while
her
head
was
in
close
conjunction
to
the
hoofs
i
suppose
astonishment
at
this
feat
must
have
numbed
my
finer
feelings
for
insists
i
bounded
over
her
prostrate
form
grabbed
the
money
from
her
hand
and
paid
the
man
before
i
even
inquired
if
she
were
killed
when
i
had
time
to
look
at
her
i
was
glad
it
was
getting
dark
and
that
we
were
in
an
unfrequented
road
her
white
serge
costume
was
mud
from
head
to
foot
her
hat
was
squashed
out
of
shape
and
even
her
poor
face
bore
traces
of
contact
with
the
red
road
at
first
she
could
rise
not
because
she
was
hurt
but
because
she
was
helpless
with
laughter
when
i
did
get
her
on
her
feet
i
found
the
only
injury
was
a
slight
cut
on
the
wrist
and
great
was
my
relief
it
was
a
blessing
that
no
native
reporters
were
near
or
morning
we
would
see
in
large
letters
shocking
affair
in
the
red
road
one
european
lady
attacks
another
my
only
fear
was
tetanus
we
have
been
told
such
tales
of
a
slight
cut
causing
death
that
i
hurried
along
until
we
burst
breathless
into
a
chemist
shop
in
park
street
and
demanded
something
to
keep
away
tetanus
the
chemist
gave
us
some
permanganate
of
potash
and
for
the
last
hour
i
have
been
bathing
the
wrist
assisted
by
bella
who
has
ruined
two
of
my
best
handkerchiefs
in
the
process
the
damaged
has
just
departed
and
i
do
hope
wo
be
much
the
worse
such
awful
things
happen
here
you
meet
people
well
and
strong
one
day
and
hear
of
their
death
the
next
death
seems
appallingly
near
one
is
given
time
to
be
ill
either
you
are
quite
well
or
else
you
are
dead
now
i
must
stop
and
go
and
dress
i
see
bella
fidgeting
when
this
reaches
you
the
old
year
will
be
very
near
its
end
i
hate
to
let
it
go
it
has
been
such
a
good
old
year
is
it
that
i
forget
the
unpleasant
parts
perhaps
but
in
looking
back
i
seem
to
remember
only
sunny
days
and
pleasant
things
to
you
my
friend
i
send
every
possible
good
wish
for
the
new
year
may
it
be
the
best
you
have
ever
had
may
it
bring
you
health
wealth
and
above
all
happiness
the
world
is
so
full
of
a
number
of
things
i
am
sure
we
should
all
be
as
happy
as
kings
is
that
a
lovable
sentiment
i
am
trying
to
take
an
interest
in
germany
and
the
germans
for
your
sake
but
as
i
told
you
before
germany
is
a
place
i
know
little
or
nothing
about
france
that
noble
fine
land
i
know
and
love
well
italy
i
should
like
better
if
there
were
not
so
many
madonnas
and
children
or
ought
i
to
say
madonnas
and
childs
to
look
at
switzerland
is
my
darling
own
place
but
germany
i
have
hitherto
only
associated
with
goethe
whom
as
a
poet
i
dislike
large
sausages
and
theological
doubts
your
description
makes
me
feel
that
i
may
have
misjudged
the
country
and
the
people
in
fact
your
little
town
sounds
a
most
attractive
place
to
live
in
no
i
do
think
i
would
expect
you
to
make
friends
easily
i
think
you
are
the
sort
of
man
to
have
hosts
of
acquaintances
and
only
one
or
two
real
friends
you
know
you
rather
scare
people
i
think
it
is
partly
your
manner
and
greatly
your
monocle
you
have
such
a
detached
air
and
often
i
have
noticed
you
very
unresponsive
when
people
were
trying
to
be
amusing
oh
i
mean
you
are
ever
rude
but
you
are
sometimes
chilling
if
i
known
from
boggley
that
you
were
as
he
puts
it
a
perfect
jewel
i
think
i
should
have
shrunk
away
from
before
you
that
first
day
we
met
and
sat
next
each
other
at
lunch
i
remember
i
talked
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
partly
i
think
because
i
was
rather
afraid
of
you
and
somehow
or
other
we
have
always
gone
on
talking
nonsense
to
each
other
since
it
has
become
a
habit
but
you
do
really
want
to
have
a
great
crowd
of
friends
do
you
it
is
only
people
like
myself
who
flop
on
any
stranger
neck
with
protestations
of
undying
affection
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
any
douglas
that
ever
was
to
make
friends
i
think
because
we
are
always
willing
to
laugh
at
the
feeblest
jest
nothing
endears
one
so
quickly
to
one
as
laughing
at
their
jokes
we
have
a
way
too
of
making
friends
with
any
casual
stranger
we
may
meet
in
trains
or
coach
or
steamer
you
superior
people
who
ignoring
your
sit
in
a
corner
and
read
do
know
what
you
miss
the
thrilling
stories
i
have
listened
to
once
i
heard
a
circumstantial
story
of
a
wreck
in
the
south
seas
told
by
the
plucky
little
wife
of
the
captain
who
had
stayed
by
her
husband
side
papa
she
called
him
while
the
ship
slowly
sank
on
a
coral
reef
and
then
drifted
about
in
an
open
boat
for
days
before
they
were
rescued
it
is
mother
however
who
meets
with
the
oddest
adventures
travelling
one
day
last
summer
i
saw
her
off
in
the
scotch
express
from
euston
comfortably
seated
in
a
corner
with
books
and
papers
expecting
she
would
have
a
nice
quiet
day
the
occupant
of
the
other
corner
was
a
russian
lady
and
the
friend
who
saw
her
off
asked
mother
if
she
would
see
she
had
lunch
all
right
for
she
knew
no
english
this
mother
readily
promised
and
the
train
started
mother
tried
once
or
twice
to
speak
to
the
creature
but
receiving
only
grunts
in
reply
began
a
book
she
had
read
the
first
chapter
when
the
old
gentleman
opposite
said
sternly
your
friend
is
fainting
and
turning
mother
was
just
in
time
to
catch
the
russian
as
she
slid
to
the
floor
she
wrestled
with
her
for
an
hour
reviving
her
with
and
making
her
comfortable
with
her
and
rug
distracted
all
the
time
by
the
yelling
of
young
infants
somewhere
near
as
soon
as
she
could
leave
her
she
went
to
see
what
was
wrong
and
found
making
day
hideous
with
their
din
while
their
poor
mother
lay
stretched
on
a
seat
too
ill
to
cope
with
them
she
was
a
missionary
wife
it
turned
out
on
her
way
home
with
no
nurse
and
much
malaria
so
of
course
mother
had
to
stay
and
nurse
the
twins
until
luncheon
was
ready
when
another
good
samaritan
came
and
took
a
turn
while
having
luncheon
she
was
hailed
by
a
friend
lately
left
a
widow
who
insisted
on
mother
accompanying
her
to
her
compartment
where
she
wept
on
her
shoulder
while
telling
her
all
the
details
of
her
husband
last
illness
then
back
again
to
nurse
the
russian
and
the
babies
until
the
journey
end
when
she
emerged
almost
as
hot
and
crumpled
and
exhausted
as
if
she
had
run
behind
all
the
way
how
heartily
my
friend
i
agree
with
you
about
the
tiresomeness
of
balls
i
think
it
must
be
old
age
approaching
but
i
ca
see
any
use
in
going
off
at
the
hour
when
under
happier
circumstances
i
would
be
thinking
of
bed
to
a
hot
crowded
ballroom
and
just
at
present
calcutta
is
simply
congested
with
balls
i
do
like
things
that
cost
a
lot
simple
little
pleasures
please
me
much
more
to
drive
out
to
tollygunge
of
an
afternoon
have
tea
and
a
game
of
croquet
look
at
the
picture
papers
and
come
quietly
home
again
is
to
me
the
height
of
bliss
tollygunge
is
a
club
some
miles
out
of
calcutta
with
a
a
very
delectable
spot
the
correct
thing
is
to
drive
out
on
sunday
morning
and
have
breakfast
out
in
the
open
air
then
one
sees
everyone
one
knows
and
it
is
very
gay
but
i
think
it
is
much
pleasanter
to
drive
out
quietly
in
the
afternoon
the
road
to
tollygunge
lies
partly
through
the
jungle
past
clusters
of
native
huts
where
little
babies
roll
and
chatter
in
the
sunlit
dust
you
know
the
jungle
is
quite
near
calcutta
when
i
lie
at
nights
and
listen
to
the
jackals
howling
i
remember
kipling
story
and
wonder
if
we
were
driven
out
and
the
jungle
were
let
in
how
long
it
would
be
before
calcutta
became
a
habitation
for
the
beasts
of
the
field
yesterday
i
drove
out
with
townley
and
and
three
tired
people
we
were
too
tired
even
to
play
the
gentle
game
of
croquet
glad
to
sit
still
in
comfortable
chairs
on
the
greensward
and
steep
ourselves
in
the
peace
and
quietness
at
tea
chil
the
kite
hovering
in
watched
us
jealously
suddenly
there
was
a
swoop
a
dark
flutter
of
wings
a
startled
squeak
from
and
our
cake
was
gone
that
india
tea
finished
while
we
still
sat
loath
to
leave
a
curious
odour
forced
itself
upon
our
attention
sniffed
sniffed
whatever
is
it
asked
townley
pointed
riverwards
to
where
a
thin
column
of
smoke
rose
and
hung
like
a
cloud
in
the
hot
still
air
it
a
burning
ghat
she
said
they
are
burning
a
body
and
is
india
when
one
is
feeling
fairly
peaceful
and
secure
something
ghastly
like
the
smell
of
burning
hindoo
recalls
to
one
the
uncertainty
of
all
things
we
rose
to
go
home
feeling
depressed
the
smell
pursuing
us
i
have
two
pieces
of
news
for
this
letter
first
boggley
can
take
a
few
days
holiday
at
christmas
so
he
means
to
take
me
to
darjeeling
to
see
if
we
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
snows
we
shall
only
be
there
from
saturday
afternoon
till
monday
at
noon
and
boggley
says
that
kangchenjunga
is
often
for
weeks
so
it
is
a
mere
chance
whether
we
shall
see
it
but
surely
surely
kangchenjunga
wo
be
coy
with
me
i
came
to
india
of
course
in
the
first
place
to
see
boggley
but
in
the
second
place
to
see
the
snows
and
i
ca
believe
that
the
gods
will
be
so
unkind
as
to
deny
a
humble
worshipper
of
great
mountains
a
sight
of
the
vision
glorious
the
other
piece
of
news
is
quite
important
boggley
has
got
a
new
billet
what
it
is
i
sha
try
to
explain
for
i
do
understand
the
game
of
general
post
which
is
played
so
frequently
among
government
officials
but
it
means
that
he
will
have
to
go
on
a
tour
of
inspection
all
over
everywhere
and
what
is
more
i
shall
go
too
is
it
fine
boggley
actually
hesitated
about
accepting
because
he
thought
i
should
so
hate
to
leave
calcutta
and
its
gaieties
to
wander
in
the
jungle
it
is
that
i
do
enjoy
calcutta
i
do
and
i
am
most
grateful
to
the
people
who
have
given
me
such
a
good
time
but
i
pine
to
see
something
of
the
real
india
calcutta
might
be
a
suburb
of
london
i
want
to
see
the
native
of
india
not
the
fat
babu
i
want
to
live
in
tents
and
be
a
gipsy
i
want
to
have
boggley
all
to
myself
we
have
hardly
time
at
present
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
each
other
boggley
tries
to
frighten
me
with
tales
of
and
jungly
cooking
but
i
wo
be
frightened
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
all
too
much
we
do
go
till
the
beginning
of
january
so
i
shall
be
able
to
attend
the
and
a
few
other
before
we
depart
this
will
have
to
do
for
a
letter
this
week
i
must
clean
some
gloves
now
that
is
the
only
useful
thing
i
do
clean
gloves
and
my
own
we
dirty
so
many
pairs
of
long
white
gloves
and
it
is
cheaper
to
clean
them
at
home
you
do
it
with
petrol
and
a
small
piece
of
flannel
and
the
result
is
bad
though
somewhat
streaky
g
part
is
to
sit
on
my
bed
and
watch
me
do
it
assisted
by
bella
on
the
floor
it
reminds
me
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
scilly
islands
who
it
is
said
earn
a
precarious
livelihood
by
taking
in
each
washings
when
kipling
wrote
his
in
i
think
he
must
have
been
in
a
down
with
fever
otherwise
he
would
hardly
have
painted
such
a
very
gloomy
picture
i
at
least
did
find
it
a
mocking
christmas
but
then
india
is
my
grim
stepmother
as
victor
ormonde
pointed
out
to
me
the
other
night
i
can
afford
to
be
can
afford
to
let
myself
think
of
the
black
dividing
sea
and
alien
plain
because
here
i
have
no
continuing
city
it
is
the
real
exiles
shackled
in
a
lifelong
tether
who
may
not
think
but
must
go
doggedly
through
their
day
darg
i
found
it
an
agreeable
day
from
the
morning
when
i
got
my
presents
and
various
offerings
of
flowers
to
the
evening
when
we
dined
with
some
very
kind
people
and
had
an
amusing
time
playing
childish
games
i
have
often
seen
pictures
headed
christmas
in
the
tropics
and
looked
with
sentimental
eyes
at
the
people
grouped
among
on
a
verandah
while
the
girl
at
the
piano
sang
what
was
evidently
a
song
about
the
dear
homeland
to
judge
from
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
all
present
it
seems
a
pity
to
disillusion
you
but
it
is
at
all
like
that
to
begin
with
it
was
quite
chilly
and
we
were
very
glad
of
the
big
fire
burning
in
the
grate
and
we
did
not
look
pensive
or
but
ate
our
dinner
with
great
content
i
think
perhaps
christmas
fare
is
even
more
uninteresting
in
india
than
at
home
turkey
tastes
more
like
white
flannel
and
is
stodgier
and
there
are
no
white
and
scarlet
berries
or
robins
but
otherwise
it
is
really
a
nicer
day
than
in
england
of
course
i
thought
a
lot
about
the
home
people
i
imagined
peter
waking
and
groping
for
his
stocking
oh
you
forgotten
what
it
felt
like
to
waken
up
and
remember
it
was
christmas
morning
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
still
hang
up
my
stocking
there
is
nothing
in
land
that
equals
the
thrill
the
delicious
bulginess
of
the
stocking
gripped
in
the
darkness
gave
one
i
think
they
would
miss
me
a
little
at
home
i
know
mother
would
often
say
i
wonder
what
olivia
is
doing
now
and
what
kind
of
christmas
had
you
a
very
festive
one
i
hope
very
many
thanks
for
the
book
you
sent
me
you
could
possibly
have
given
me
anything
i
like
better
somehow
i
have
never
possessed
a
copy
of
child
garden
of
and
this
one
so
exquisitely
specially
bound
will
be
a
great
treasure
i
like
too
your
reason
for
choosing
it
it
is
nice
of
you
to
like
my
childish
reminiscences
but
it
is
rash
to
say
you
wish
you
had
known
us
then
looking
at
us
now
so
quiet
so
ornaments
to
society
you
would
be
surprised
what
villains
we
once
were
at
least
on
we
had
what
calls
a
covenanting
childhood
looking
back
it
seems
to
me
that
our
childhood
was
a
queer
mixture
of
calvinism
and
fairy
tales
calvinism
even
now
i
associate
with
ham
and
eggs
i
suppose
because
sabbath
morning
was
the
only
time
we
ever
tasted
that
delicacy
between
bustling
saturday
night
when
we
wistfully
watched
our
toys
being
locked
away
and
cheery
monday
morning
when
things
began
again
there
was
a
great
gulf
fixed
and
that
was
the
sabbath
day
what
strenuous
sabbath
days
we
had
first
there
was
worship
and
the
catechism
the
only
time
i
ever
wished
to
be
english
was
when
i
thought
i
might
have
dallied
with
what
is
your
name
instead
of
wrestling
with
such
deep
things
as
what
is
man
chief
end
after
worship
was
over
we
were
allowed
to
walk
in
the
garden
till
it
was
time
for
the
morning
service
that
was
the
forenoon
diet
of
worship
then
came
the
afternoon
diet
of
worship
having
sat
like
rocks
through
them
both
we
proceeded
to
the
sabbath
school
and
then
went
home
to
tea
and
cake
and
jam
and
an
evening
filled
with
bound
volumes
of
christian
where
we
wrestled
with
tales
of
religious
bigotry
and
persecution
until
we
seemed
to
breathe
the
very
atmosphere
of
dark
and
mouldy
cells
and
became
daringly
familiar
with
the
and
the
rack
the
inquisition
and
other
devildoms
of
spain
i
used
to
wonder
pitifully
why
it
had
never
occurred
to
the
poor
victims
to
say
their
prayers
in
bed
and
thus
save
themselves
such
fiery
trials
i
wonder
why
i
pretend
we
found
our
sundays
a
trial
looking
back
i
love
every
minute
of
them
father
could
make
any
day
delightful
and
what
a
father
he
was
sometimes
he
came
to
tea
with
us
in
the
nursery
and
made
believe
there
was
a
fairy
called
annabel
lee
in
the
teapot
carrying
on
conversations
with
her
that
sent
eerie
thrills
down
our
several
spines
afterwards
he
would
read
out
of
a
little
green
and
gold
book
that
contained
for
us
all
the
romance
of
the
ages
between
its
elegant
covers
from
father
we
heard
of
angus
the
subtle
morag
of
the
misty
way
and
the
king
of
errin
who
rides
and
rides
and
whose
road
is
to
the
end
of
days
sometimes
laying
books
aside
he
told
us
old
tales
that
he
had
heard
from
his
mother
who
in
turn
had
heard
them
from
hers
of
the
red
etain
of
ireland
who
lived
in
belligand
and
who
stole
the
king
daughter
the
king
of
fair
scotland
and
the
pathetic
tale
of
the
bannock
that
went
to
see
the
world
with
its
cynical
end
ah
well
we
all
be
in
the
tod
hole
in
less
than
a
hunner
years
it
was
father
who
gave
us
first
a
love
for
books
and
taught
us
the
magic
of
lovely
words
and
it
was
father
who
tried
to
place
our
stumbling
little
childish
feet
in
the
narrow
way
and
to
turn
our
eyes
ever
towards
a
better
country
that
is
an
heavenly
i
suppose
it
was
the
talk
of
the
better
country
that
gave
john
and
me
the
idea
of
our
kingdom
it
was
a
great
secret
once
but
now
i
may
tell
without
breaking
faith
boggley
and
the
bird
were
prosaic
people
caring
more
for
and
red
indian
hunting
than
games
of
so
they
never
knew
it
was
part
of
the
sunny
old
garden
our
kingdom
and
was
called
nontland
because
it
was
ruled
by
one
nont
he
had
once
been
a
common
ninepin
but
having
had
a
hole
bored
through
his
middle
with
a
wire
he
became
possessed
of
a
mystic
power
and
personality
even
we
his
creators
so
to
speak
stood
somewhat
in
awe
of
him
the
river
beulah
flowed
through
nontland
and
it
was
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
celestial
mountains
on
the
south
by
the
red
brick
wall
where
the
big
pears
grew
on
the
west
by
the
rose
of
sharon
tree
and
on
the
east
by
the
that
last
sounds
something
of
a
descent
but
it
was
really
a
and
i
ca
think
why
it
was
called
so
for
to
my
knowledge
it
had
never
harboured
anything
but
two
innocent
white
russian
rabbits
with
pink
eyes
it
was
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
next
door
to
the
the
roof
made
of
pavement
flags
was
easy
to
climb
and
sloping
as
it
did
to
the
top
of
the
wall
overlooking
the
was
greatly
prized
by
us
as
a
from
which
we
could
see
the
world
go
by
to
get
into
our
kingdom
we
knocked
at
the
wicket
gate
murmuring
as
we
did
so
el
dorado
yo
he
trovado
and
it
opened
with
a
push
we
had
an
idea
then
nor
have
i
now
what
the
words
meant
we
got
them
out
of
a
book
called
spanish
and
thought
them
splendidly
mysterious
besides
ourselves
and
nont
and
the
russian
rabbits
there
was
only
one
other
denizen
of
our
kingdom
a
turkey
with
a
broken
leg
a
lonely
lovable
fowl
which
john
out
of
pity
raised
to
the
peerage
and
the
office
of
prime
minister
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
riding
in
hot
haste
on
a
rake
to
tell
the
king
not
in
proper
fairy
fashion
that
the
skies
were
fallen
but
that
lord
turkey
of
henhouse
was
dead
john
i
remember
always
carried
some
fern
seed
in
his
he
said
it
made
him
invisible
a
delusion
i
loyally
supported
it
seems
to
me
the
sun
always
shone
in
those
days
the
time
was
ever
three
in
the
afternoon
and
faery
lay
just
adown
the
road
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
and
it
is
an
awesome
thought
that
you
must
converse
every
day
and
all
day
in
the
german
language
i
believe
i
have
forgotten
all
i
ever
knew
of
german
though
it
is
so
very
long
ago
since
i
wrestled
in
tears
and
confused
darkness
of
mind
with
that
uncouth
tongue
do
forget
your
native
tongue
and
do
dare
write
me
a
letter
in
german
or
like
the
editor
of
i
shall
say
this
correspondence
must
now
cease
since
last
i
wrote
life
has
been
one
long
changing
of
garments
and
moving
from
one
show
to
another
tuesday
was
viceroy
cup
day
at
the
races
a
very
pretty
sight
one
side
of
the
ground
was
crowded
by
pretty
women
in
lovely
gowns
and
on
the
other
side
the
natives
sat
in
their
hundreds
and
chattered
not
the
crowd
we
produce
but
gay
and
striking
as
a
bed
of
tulips
there
are
three
stands
one
for
the
members
of
the
turf
club
one
for
the
ordinary
public
and
one
for
the
natives
who
can
afford
a
seat
the
members
of
the
turf
club
may
be
said
to
be
the
sheep
the
others
the
goats
it
is
more
comfortable
in
every
way
to
be
a
sheep
you
get
a
better
seat
and
a
comfortable
tea
in
an
enclosure
with
the
sight
of
the
goats
scrambling
wildly
for
a
little
refreshment
to
keep
you
thankful
for
in
the
heat
and
dust
and
glare
even
a
sheep
is
apt
to
lose
sight
of
its
mercies
i
thought
was
the
prettiest
girl
there
she
is
always
such
a
refreshing
sight
pink
and
white
and
golden
like
a
morning
in
may
and
tall
like
a
king
own
daughter
i
was
with
the
ormondes
and
of
course
boggley
ormonde
is
so
charming
she
is
a
great
favourite
with
men
and
is
always
surrounded
when
she
goes
anywhere
by
about
half
a
dozen
eager
for
her
smiles
she
has
the
quaintest
way
of
handing
her
surplus
cavaliers
on
to
me
but
i
really
much
prefer
victor
and
boggley
as
companions
they
do
need
to
be
amused
like
other
men
and
are
always
and
funny
i
am
feeling
a
little
pale
with
all
the
excitement
and
shall
be
glad
of
the
change
to
darjeeling
next
mail
you
shall
hear
all
about
it
that
is
to
say
if
no
person
seditiously
inclined
derails
the
train
or
does
anything
horrid
some
very
dreadful
things
have
been
happening
lately
but
i
do
think
there
is
much
danger
so
long
as
we
keep
far
from
the
vicinity
of
dignitaries
new
year
wednesday
already
the
mail
goes
and
i
with
so
much
to
write
about
to
begin
we
left
calcutta
on
friday
afternoon
and
got
to
the
ganges
about
eight
when
we
embarked
in
a
to
cross
the
river
it
was
quite
a
big
steamer
with
laid
out
on
deck
decorated
for
christmas
with
chinese
lanterns
and
large
iced
cakes
on
the
other
side
the
train
was
waiting
that
was
to
take
us
to
siliguri
and
we
lost
no
time
in
looking
for
places
indian
trains
are
rather
different
from
our
trains
each
carriage
has
two
broad
seats
running
lengthways
which
pull
out
for
sleeping
berths
and
two
other
berths
that
let
down
from
the
roof
i
found
i
had
to
share
a
carriage
with
two
other
females
and
an
upper
berth
fell
to
my
share
the
bearer
arranged
my
bed
and
boggley
took
a
glance
round
asked
if
i
were
all
right
and
departed
to
his
own
place
is
it
a
queer
idea
to
carry
one
bedding
about
with
one
pillows
blankets
and
a
quilt
all
done
up
in
a
canvas
accompany
people
wherever
they
travel
in
trains
hotels
even
when
staying
with
friends
well
there
was
i
shut
up
for
the
night
with
two
strange
women
mother
and
daughter
evidently
american
certainly
and
the
horror
of
an
upper
berth
staring
me
in
the
face
it
is
quite
an
experience
to
sleep
in
the
upper
berth
of
an
indian
train
to
begin
with
it
takes
an
acrobat
of
no
mean
order
to
reach
it
at
all
and
once
you
are
in
your
nose
almost
touches
the
roof
of
the
carriage
as
i
climbed
to
my
lofty
perch
one
of
the
american
ladies
remarked
i
guess
child
you
going
to
have
the
time
of
your
life
up
there
and
i
had
every
time
the
train
gave
a
jolt
which
it
did
every
few
seconds
i
clung
wildly
to
the
straps
to
keep
myself
from
descending
suddenly
and
violently
to
the
floor
and
in
less
than
an
hour
every
bone
in
my
body
was
crying
out
against
the
inhuman
hardness
of
my
couch
in
spite
of
everything
i
fell
asleep
and
awoke
feeling
colder
than
i
ever
remember
feeling
before
i
started
up
banging
my
head
on
the
roof
as
i
did
so
to
find
that
the
carriage
door
was
swinging
wide
open
what
was
to
be
done
i
carefully
felt
the
bumps
beginning
to
rise
on
my
forehead
and
considered
it
was
humanly
speaking
impossible
that
i
could
descend
and
shut
that
door
and
yet
could
i
endure
lying
inadequately
covered
and
exposed
to
all
the
winds
of
heaven
there
remained
my
they
at
least
were
on
the
first
floor
so
to
speak
but
as
i
wavered
a
striking
apparition
rose
stalked
down
the
carriage
and
leaning
far
out
into
the
night
seized
the
door
and
shut
it
with
a
bang
then
arose
a
shrill
protest
from
beneath
me
oh
mommer
how
could
you
be
so
careless
you
might
have
fallen
out
and
i
should
have
been
left
quite
alone
in
this
awful
heathen
country
after
that
there
was
no
more
sleep
and
when
daylight
came
filtering
through
the
shutters
i
slid
warily
to
the
floor
and
having
washed
and
dressed
sat
on
my
and
conversed
amiably
with
the
americans
i
found
them
charming
and
most
entertaining
simple
quiet
people
not
the
tourist
at
all
they
had
been
travelling
so
they
told
me
with
a
sort
of
dreary
satisfaction
for
two
years
and
they
had
still
about
a
year
to
do
it
sounded
like
hard
labour
the
poor
dears
i
ca
think
why
they
did
it
they
would
have
been
so
much
happier
at
home
in
their
own
little
corner
of
the
world
i
can
picture
them
attending
sewing
bees
and
other
quaint
things
people
do
attend
in
new
england
storybooks
they
had
a
servant
with
them
whom
they
addressed
as
ali
a
bearded
rascal
who
evidently
cheated
them
at
every
turn
and
who
actually
came
into
their
presence
with
his
shoes
on
i
did
know
till
i
met
these
americans
that
i
was
such
a
wit
or
perhaps
wag
is
a
better
word
i
did
try
to
be
funny
i
did
even
know
i
was
being
funny
but
every
word
i
said
convulsed
them
the
mommer
said
to
me
child
are
you
married
no
i
said
surprised
why
i
was
just
thinking
what
a
good
time
your
husband
must
have
when
we
reached
siliguri
i
was
surprised
to
find
everything
glistening
with
frost
and
the
few
natives
who
were
about
had
their
heads
wrapped
up
in
shawls
as
if
they
were
suffering
from
toothache
we
got
some
breakfast
in
the
and
then
took
our
places
in
the
funniest
little
toy
train
this
is
the
railway
it
was
all
very
primitive
a
man
banged
with
a
stick
on
a
piece
of
metal
by
way
of
a
and
we
set
off
on
our
journey
to
cloudland
eagerly
looked
for
darjeeling
came
at
last
but
alack
no
mountains
only
banks
of
white
clouds
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
we
were
glad
to
get
out
and
stamp
up
to
the
hotel
where
we
found
great
fires
burning
in
our
rooms
there
was
much
to
do
in
the
hotel
beyond
reading
back
numbers
of
lady
and
i
went
to
bed
on
saturday
night
rather
low
in
my
mind
fearing
after
all
i
was
not
to
be
accounted
worthy
to
behold
the
mountains
some
of
the
people
in
the
hotel
were
getting
up
at
to
go
to
tiger
hill
to
see
the
sun
rise
on
everest
boggley
the
lazy
one
hear
of
going
and
when
i
awoke
in
the
grey
dawning
stiff
with
cold
in
spite
of
a
fire
and
heaps
of
blankets
and
rugs
i
felt
thankful
that
i
had
a
strenuous
brother
if
it
had
been
john
i
dare
not
think
where
he
would
have
made
me
accompany
him
to
in
his
efforts
to
get
as
near
as
possible
to
his
beloved
mountains
never
shall
i
forget
the
first
time
he
took
me
to
switzerland
to
climb
i
had
never
climbed
before
unless
you
call
scrambling
on
the
hills
at
home
climbing
and
i
was
all
eagerness
to
try
till
john
gave
me
whymper
book
on
zermatt
to
amuse
me
in
the
train
and
i
read
of
the
first
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
and
its
tragic
sequel
it
had
the
effect
of
reducing
me
to
a
state
of
abject
terror
all
through
that
journey
from
paris
to
lausanne
from
lausanne
to
visp
from
visp
to
zermatt
horror
of
the
matterhorn
hung
over
me
like
a
pall
i
even
found
something
sinister
in
little
zermatt
when
we
got
there
zermatt
that
now
i
love
so
with
the
rushing
icy
river
the
cheerful
smell
of
wood
smoke
the
goats
that
in
the
early
morning
wake
one
with
the
of
the
bells
through
the
street
and
the
guides
that
sit
on
the
wall
in
the
twilight
and
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
after
dinner
that
first
night
we
walked
through
the
village
and
along
the
winding
path
that
leads
up
to
the
schwarzsee
and
gazed
at
the
mighty
peak
so
wild
so
savage
in
the
pale
purple
light
that
follows
the
sunset
glow
gazed
at
it
in
silence
john
wrapped
in
adoration
i
thinking
of
the
men
who
had
gone
up
this
road
to
their
death
yes
said
john
as
we
turned
back
some
very
scared
men
have
come
down
this
road
if
he
had
known
what
an
exceedingly
scared
girl
was
at
his
side
he
would
i
think
have
chosen
that
moment
to
turn
into
the
little
graveyard
that
surrounds
the
village
chapel
to
look
at
the
graves
of
the
victims
the
graves
of
croz
the
guide
of
hudson
and
the
boy
hadow
the
text
on
one
stone
caught
my
eye
ye
therefore
also
ready
it
was
too
much
i
fled
back
to
the
hotel
locked
the
door
of
my
room
shuttered
the
windows
so
that
i
should
not
see
the
vestige
of
a
mountain
and
wept
it
is
odd
to
think
how
i
hated
it
all
that
night
how
to
myself
i
maligned
all
climbers
calling
them
in
my
haste
foolhardy
senseless
imbecile
when
i
had
only
to
go
up
my
first
easy
mountain
to
become
as
keen
as
the
worst
or
the
best
sometimes
in
those
mountaineering
excursions
with
john
to
zermatt
to
chamonix
to
grindelwald
i
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
envy
the
unaspiring
people
who
spend
long
days
pottering
about
on
level
ground
but
looking
back
it
is
the
quiet
lazy
days
one
likes
to
think
about
no
rather
it
is
the
mornings
when
one
rose
at
and
thrusting
aching
feet
into
nailed
boots
tiptoed
noisily
into
the
deserted
to
be
supplied
with
coffee
and
rolls
by
a
pitifully
sleepy
waiter
outside
the
guides
wait
joseph
and
aloys
and
away
we
tramp
in
single
file
along
the
little
path
that
runs
through
fields
full
of
wild
flowers
drenched
with
dew
into
a
wood
of
tall
straight
we
follow
the
steady
slow
footsteps
of
joseph
the
chief
guide
up
the
winding
path
that
turns
and
twists
and
turns
again
but
rises
always
rises
until
we
are
clear
of
the
wood
past
the
rough
stony
ground
and
on
to
the
snow
firm
and
hard
to
the
feet
before
the
sun
has
melted
the
night
frost
when
we
reach
the
rocks
and
before
we
rope
aloys
removes
his
r√ºcksack
and
proceeds
to
lay
out
our
luncheon
for
if
one
breakfasts
at
two
one
is
ready
for
the
next
meal
at
nine
crouched
in
strange
attitudes
we
munch
cold
chicken
rolls
and
eggs
sweet
biscuits
and
apples
with
great
content
joseph
has
buried
a
bottle
of
white
wine
in
the
snow
and
now
pours
some
into
a
horn
tumbler
which
he
hands
to
mademoiselle
with
an
air
a
draught
of
nectar
it
is
john
turn
for
the
tumbler
next
and
as
he
emerges
from
the
long
satisfying
drink
he
declares
his
firm
intention
his
unalterable
resolve
never
to
drink
anything
but
white
wine
again
in
this
world
but
doubtless
as
you
know
the
white
wine
of
the
lowlands
is
not
the
white
wine
of
the
mountains
it
needs
to
be
buried
in
the
snow
by
joseph
and
drunk
out
of
a
horn
tumbler
at
the
foot
of
an
aiguille
after
a
six
hours
climb
to
be
at
its
best
after
refreshment
comes
the
hard
work
to
look
at
the
face
of
the
rock
up
which
joseph
has
swarmed
to
say
hopelessly
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
and
then
gradually
to
find
here
a
niche
for
one
hand
here
a
foothold
to
learn
to
cling
to
the
rock
to
use
every
bit
of
oneself
to
work
one
way
up
delicately
as
a
cat
so
as
not
to
send
loose
stones
down
on
the
climber
below
until
panting
one
lands
on
the
ledge
appointed
by
joseph
there
to
rest
while
the
next
man
climbs
it
is
the
best
of
sports
and
at
the
top
to
stand
in
the
stainless
eminence
of
air
to
look
down
eight
ten
a
thousand
feet
to
the
toy
village
at
the
foot
while
john
names
all
the
other
angel
peaks
that
soar
round
us
tell
me
you
who
are
also
a
climber
is
it
not
very
good
but
the
coming
down
stumbling
wearily
down
the
steep
paths
of
the
with
the
skin
rubbed
off
one
toes
and
giving
at
the
knees
like
an
old
and
feeble
horse
that
is
not
so
good
and
yet
i
do
know
for
as
we
near
the
valley
puffs
of
hot
scented
air
come
up
to
meet
us
the
tinkle
of
the
greets
our
ears
and
we
realize
that
it
is
only
given
to
those
who
have
braved
the
perils
who
have
searched
for
the
deep
things
of
the
ancient
mountains
and
found
out
the
precious
things
of
the
lasting
hills
to
thoroughly
appreciate
the
pleasant
homely
quietness
of
the
but
i
have
wandered
miles
away
from
sunday
morning
in
darjeeling
it
was
still
misty
when
we
went
out
after
breakfast
but
not
so
solidly
misty
so
boggley
held
out
hopes
it
would
clear
darjeeling
is
a
pretty
place
tucked
into
the
in
the
middle
is
the
bazaar
and
it
happened
to
be
market
day
which
made
it
more
interesting
the
village
street
was
lined
on
both
sides
with
open
booths
some
piled
with
fruit
and
vegetables
others
oddly
enough
with
lamps
and
mirrors
and
other
cheap
rubbish
which
bore
the
legend
made
in
germany
others
with
all
sorts
of
curios
the
place
was
thronged
with
people
a
few
plainsmen
and
tibetans
boggley
pointed
out
but
most
of
the
crowd
were
jolly
little
squat
men
and
women
hung
with
silver
chains
and
heavy
set
with
turquoises
their
eyes
are
very
black
and
all
puckered
with
laughing
and
they
have
actually
rosy
cheeks
they
crowded
round
trying
to
sell
us
curios
and
lumps
of
rough
turquoise
when
we
asked
the
price
of
anything
they
replied
promptly
twenty
rupees
we
would
offer
two
rupees
and
after
a
few
bargaining
they
took
it
quite
cheerfully
the
thing
probably
not
being
worth
eight
annas
i
bought
a
it
is
a
round
silver
thing
with
a
handle
rather
like
a
child
rattle
and
inside
are
slips
of
paper
covered
with
writing
these
are
the
prayers
and
at
intervals
you
twirl
the
wheel
round
and
the
oftener
you
turn
it
the
more
devout
you
are
i
also
purchased
some
lumps
of
rough
turquoise
though
boggley
said
they
were
not
a
good
blue
too
pale
and
was
tying
them
up
in
my
handkerchief
when
boggley
gripped
my
arm
look
he
said
i
looked
straight
across
the
valley
higher
said
boggley
and
i
lifted
my
eyes
literally
to
the
skies
and
there
suddenly
behold
beyond
were
the
everlasting
snows
all
day
they
stayed
with
us
and
as
the
sun
was
setting
we
climbed
to
a
point
of
vantage
to
see
the
last
of
them
it
has
been
said
they
are
a
wall
barring
the
whole
horizon
they
are
like
a
city
carved
by
giants
out
of
eternal
ice
a
city
which
lieth
we
watched
while
peak
after
peak
faded
into
cold
greyness
until
kangchenjunga
towered
alone
into
the
heavens
sublime
in
its
valorous
isolation
then
the
light
left
it
too
and
we
turned
and
came
down
from
the
hill
of
god
we
left
for
calcutta
at
noon
on
monday
and
i
had
a
thoroughly
uncomfortable
day
all
owing
to
boggley
forethought
he
said
as
we
began
breakfast
about
nine
now
eat
a
good
breakfast
for
we
shall
have
to
leave
before
lunch
and
no
man
knows
when
we
shall
get
another
meal
it
seemed
good
so
i
ate
an
egg
and
two
pieces
of
toast
after
i
had
really
finished
that
was
all
very
well
but
the
hotel
people
thoughtfully
provided
us
with
a
substantial
luncheon
before
we
left
even
then
boggley
kept
on
looking
to
the
future
oh
tuck
in
he
said
we
sha
get
anything
more
till
eight
i
did
feel
as
if
i
wanted
anything
ever
again
but
i
hurriedly
gobbled
some
food
and
we
raced
to
the
station
then
sat
in
the
train
half
an
hour
before
it
started
at
the
first
station
we
stopped
at
the
bearer
appeared
at
the
carriage
window
with
a
breakfast
cup
of
tea
and
a
large
ferreted
from
no
man
knows
where
he
was
so
pleased
with
himself
that
i
had
the
heart
to
refuse
it
so
there
were
three
meals
that
ought
to
have
been
spread
over
the
greater
part
of
the
day
crowded
into
one
morning
i
sympathized
with
the
vulture
who
eats
between
his
meals
and
that
the
reason
why
he
very
very
rarely
feels
as
well
as
you
and
i
it
is
never
pleasant
to
come
down
from
the
heights
and
we
had
rather
a
dreary
journey
to
siliguri
boggley
had
taken
care
to
wire
for
a
lower
berth
in
the
train
for
me
but
it
seems
ordained
that
i
shall
ascend
in
indian
trains
i
again
found
myself
in
a
carriage
with
my
americans
and
the
daughter
had
such
bad
toothache
and
seemed
so
much
to
dread
the
prospect
of
mounting
to
the
eyrie
that
i
had
to
say
that
i
would
rather
like
it
for
myself
toothache
kept
miss
america
awake
and
made
her
talkative
which
was
unfortunate
for
me
she
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
british
she
only
knew
us
from
the
outside
so
to
speak
incidentally
she
shed
a
lurid
light
on
the
habits
of
the
american
male
it
seems
that
young
men
in
america
are
expected
to
carry
offerings
of
fruit
and
flowers
and
candy
to
young
women
not
when
they
are
engaged
mark
you
what
is
expected
of
them
then
i
dare
think
but
to
quite
irrelevant
young
women
do
young
gentlemen
do
so
in
england
asked
miss
america
no
i
said
feeling
that
i
was
making
out
my
countrymen
poor
mean
creatures
indeed
but
feeling
also
how
much
more
complicated
life
would
become
for
these
gentlemen
of
england
now
abed
if
they
had
to
carry
crates
of
oranges
drums
of
figs
and
pounds
of
candies
to
every
casual
young
woman
whose
acquaintance
they
enjoyed
you
do
say
said
miss
america
and
do
they
take
you
out
driving
in
their
buggies
i
replied
firmly
they
have
got
them
you
do
say
and
how
does
a
young
gentleman
show
he
admires
you
well
he
does
as
a
rule
i
murmured
feebly
i
guess
she
said
we
manage
things
better
in
america
and
indeed
perhaps
they
do
this
conversation
so
exhausted
us
that
we
fell
very
sound
asleep
and
knew
nothing
till
we
arrived
at
the
station
where
we
had
to
get
out
and
change
into
the
then
there
was
a
terrible
scurry
the
servants
waiting
to
pack
up
the
bedding
and
strap
bags
they
said
they
had
wakened
us
at
the
previous
station
but
they
must
have
wakened
someone
else
instead
while
we
threw
on
various
articles
of
clothing
stuck
hats
on
undone
hair
and
feet
into
unlaced
shoes
all
the
while
like
a
greek
chorus
the
mommer
moaning
reproachfully
oh
ali
you
might
have
woke
us
while
outside
on
the
platform
bounded
the
irate
boggley
speaking
wing√©d
words
we
did
get
on
to
the
boat
so
after
all
there
was
no
harm
done
i
was
quite
sorry
to
part
with
my
americans
when
we
reached
calcutta
they
and
their
ali
were
going
on
to
benares
that
night
tired
and
spiritless
they
shook
us
both
violently
by
the
hand
vowing
we
were
just
lovely
people
and
that
i
was
a
real
little
john
bull
the
home
mail
was
waiting
us
when
we
got
back
and
i
read
my
letters
slept
for
an
hour
or
two
and
then
got
up
and
went
to
a
big
new
where
we
had
fireworks
in
our
crackers
and
sang
what
calls
oldlangzine
thanks
so
much
for
your
delightfully
long
letter
my
wrist
aches
so
i
ca
write
another
word
one
more
week
and
we
start
for
the
mofussil
and
the
simple
life
the
mofussil
i
may
remark
in
passing
is
not
as
at
first
i
thought
some
sort
of
prophet
but
means
simply
the
country
districts
i
have
been
standing
over
bella
while
she
laid
out
all
my
dresses
telling
her
which
are
to
be
packed
carefully
and
left
in
calcutta
and
which
are
to
accompany
me
i
do
want
to
take
any
more
luggage
than
i
can
help
as
it
is
i
foresee
we
shall
have
a
mountain
boggley
has
been
begging
everyone
for
the
loan
of
books
as
he
does
not
see
how
i
am
to
be
kept
in
reading
matter
when
there
are
no
libraries
within
reach
he
accuses
me
of
being
capable
of
finishing
two
fat
volumes
in
a
day
but
i
sha
have
time
to
read
much
if
i
carry
out
my
great
project
am
going
to
write
a
you
are
surprised
but
why
other
members
of
the
family
can
write
why
not
i
i
read
in
a
review
lately
that
john
has
great
distinction
of
style
so
perhaps
i
have
too
anyway
i
have
bought
a
pile
of
and
of
j
nibs
and
i
mean
to
find
out
it
is
to
be
a
book
about
the
mutiny
the
information
to
be
derived
from
trevelyan
book
on
cawnpore
there
is
room
do
you
think
for
a
really
good
book
on
the
mutiny
last
night
the
was
held
by
the
vicereine
a
function
that
everyone
more
or
less
is
expected
to
attend
i
went
with
and
her
sister
one
need
go
with
the
lady
who
presents
one
and
found
it
most
entertaining
not
being
the
wives
or
daughters
of
members
of
council
or
anything
we
had
the
private
entr√©e
and
had
to
wait
our
turn
in
pens
like
dumb
driven
cattle
it
is
a
much
simpler
affair
than
a
presentation
at
home
one
need
not
even
wear
veils
and
feathers
and
the
trains
of
our
white
satin
gowns
were
modest
as
to
length
it
was
silly
to
be
nervous
about
such
a
little
thing
but
i
quite
shook
with
terror
i
think
it
was
the
being
passed
along
by
that
unnerved
me
but
when
i
reached
the
last
and
heard
to
be
presented
and
my
name
shouted
out
i
stotted
do
you
know
the
scots
word
to
stot
it
means
to
walk
blindly
to
stumble
that
and
much
more
oh
a
very
expressive
word
over
a
length
of
red
carpet
that
seemed
to
stretch
for
miles
feeling
exactly
as
a
dutch
wooden
doll
looks
saw
as
in
a
glass
darkly
familiar
faces
that
smiled
jeeringly
or
encouragingly
i
could
not
be
sure
which
ducked
feebly
and
uncertainly
before
the
two
centre
figures
and
gasping
relief
found
myself
going
out
of
the
doorway
walking
on
train
afterwards
when
we
were
all
gathered
upstairs
the
many
pretty
gowns
and
uniforms
made
a
gay
sight
i
saw
the
dearest
little
maharanee
blazing
in
magnificent
jewels
and
looking
so
scared
and
shy
and
sweet
there
was
a
and
lots
to
eat
if
one
could
have
got
at
it
or
had
had
room
to
eat
it
after
it
had
been
got
i
do
like
champagne
simpkin
they
call
it
here
much
to
drink
but
i
like
it
less
when
it
is
shot
down
my
back
by
a
careless
man
there
is
a
ball
at
government
house
and
that
is
the
last
of
my
dissipations
for
some
time
to
come
i
go
on
writing
writing
all
the
time
about
my
own
affairs
and
never
even
mention
your
letters
and
nothing
makes
me
so
cross
as
to
have
people
do
that
to
me
i
like
my
friends
to
make
interested
comments
on
everything
i
tell
them
i
am
glad
you
are
so
happy
in
your
work
and
enjoy
life
is
the
book
nearly
finished
yet
it
is
nice
that
you
have
found
such
charming
friends
is
the
fr√§ulein
person
you
talk
about
pretty
i
can
imagine
how
you
enjoy
hearing
her
play
and
singing
to
her
accompaniment
i
always
think
of
you
when
i
hear
good
music
and
of
your
face
when
i
told
you
that
the
only
music
i
really
liked
was
scots
songs
played
on
the
pianola
but
you
know
that
is
really
true
i
simply
hate
good
music
once
in
paris
i
went
with
some
people
to
hear
et
and
while
everyone
sat
rapt
enchanted
by
the
sweet
sounds
i
waited
with
what
patience
i
could
till
the
stage
temple
fell
in
the
vain
hope
that
some
part
would
hit
the
tenor
what
would
your
fr√§ulein
say
to
such
blasphemy
forgive
me
maligning
the
gods
of
your
idolatry
i
think
i
had
better
finish
this
letter
before
i
go
on
from
bad
to
worse
because
i
am
in
an
unaccountably
perverse
and
impertinent
frame
of
mind
and
there
is
no
saying
what
i
shall
say
next
such
a
scene
of
confusion
everything
i
possess
is
lying
on
the
floor
all
the
things
i
have
accumulated
on
my
way
out
and
since
i
came
to
calcutta
lie
in
one
heap
waiting
to
be
packed
shoes
dresses
hats
books
photographs
are
scattered
madly
about
and
in
the
middle
almost
reduced
to
idiocy
and
making
no
effort
to
reduce
chaos
to
order
sits
bella
i
ca
help
her
for
i
must
get
my
home
letters
written
and
posted
before
we
leave
calcutta
for
before
i
reach
my
first
the
mail
will
be
gone
boggley
has
been
in
the
mofussil
for
three
days
and
i
have
been
staying
with
the
townleys
i
came
back
last
night
it
was
nice
being
with
again
and
her
sister
is
extraordinarily
kind
we
had
rather
an
interesting
day
on
friday
i
have
always
been
asking
where
are
the
missionaries
but
i
suppose
i
must
have
asked
the
wrong
people
for
they
did
seem
to
know
however
the
other
day
i
met
a
lady
gardner
the
wife
of
a
missionary
who
asked
us
to
go
to
lunch
with
her
and
promised
she
would
show
us
something
of
the
work
among
the
women
so
on
friday
we
set
off
in
a
we
left
the
calcutta
we
knew
the
european
shops
the
big
cool
houses
the
maidan
and
drove
through
native
streets
airless
treeless
places
until
we
despaired
of
ever
reaching
anywhere
when
at
last
our
man
did
stop
we
found
gardner
cool
a
welcome
refuge
from
the
glare
and
the
dust
and
she
was
kindness
itself
she
made
a
delightful
cicerone
for
she
has
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
a
wide
knowledge
of
native
life
we
went
first
to
see
the
girls
school
a
quaint
sight
all
the
funny
little
women
with
their
hair
well
oiled
and
plastered
down
with
iron
bangles
on
their
wrists
to
show
that
they
were
married
wrapped
in
their
so
demurely
chanting
their
lessons
when
we
went
in
they
all
stood
up
and
touching
their
foreheads
said
in
a
queer
drawl
salaam
mees
sahib
salaam
the
teachers
were
native
the
schoolrooms
opened
on
to
a
court
with
a
well
like
a
village
pump
in
the
middle
one
small
girl
was
brought
out
to
tell
us
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
in
bengali
which
she
did
at
great
length
with
dramatic
gestures
but
our
attention
was
somewhat
diverted
from
her
by
a
small
boy
who
ran
in
from
the
street
hot
and
dusty
sluiced
himself
unconcernedly
all
over
at
the
pump
and
raced
out
again
dripping
it
did
look
so
inviting
when
we
left
the
school
gardner
said
she
would
take
us
to
see
some
women
that
is
women
who
never
go
out
with
their
faces
uncovered
and
who
never
see
any
men
but
their
own
husbands
i
do
quite
know
what
we
expected
to
see
something
very
oriental
and
luxurious
anyhow
marble
halls
and
women
with
veils
and
scarlet
satin
trousers
dotted
about
on
cushions
and
the
reality
was
disappointing
no
marble
halls
no
divans
and
richly
carved
tables
no
hookahs
and
languid
odours
of
rich
perfumes
but
a
room
with
cheap
modern
furniture
china
ornaments
and
a
round
table
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
for
all
the
world
like
the
best
parlour
of
the
working
classes
two
women
lived
there
with
their
husbands
and
families
and
they
came
in
and
looked
and
me
all
over
fingered
our
dresses
examined
our
hats
and
then
asked
why
we
were
married
i
could
see
they
did
like
the
look
of
us
at
all
they
said
we
were
like
the
dolls
their
little
girls
got
at
the
f√™te
and
produced
two
atrocities
with
flaxen
hair
and
vivid
pink
cheeks
and
asked
if
we
saw
the
resemblance
we
did
they
told
gardner
who
has
been
many
years
in
india
and
looks
it
that
they
thought
she
was
much
than
we
were
her
face
was
all
one
colour
they
spoke
of
course
in
bengali
but
gardner
translated
poor
women
what
a
pitifully
dull
life
is
theirs
was
disappointed
to
hear
they
had
become
christians
she
had
an
idea
that
the
missionary
had
only
to
appear
with
the
gospel
story
and
the
deed
was
done
i
afraid
it
is
as
easy
as
that
by
a
long
way
gardner
read
a
chapter
from
the
bible
while
we
were
there
and
these
women
argued
with
her
most
intelligently
they
are
by
no
means
stupid
before
we
left
sang
to
them
with
no
accompaniment
but
a
cold
stare
when
she
finished
they
said
they
preferred
bengali
music
it
had
more
tune
we
left
feeling
we
had
been
no
success
having
seen
a
comparatively
household
gardner
said
she
would
show
us
a
really
poor
one
we
followed
her
through
a
network
of
lanes
more
than
anything
i
ever
imagined
london
ca
compete
with
calcutta
in
the
way
of
odours
until
we
reached
a
little
hovel
with
nothing
in
it
but
a
a
few
and
two
women
caste
it
seems
has
nothing
to
do
with
money
and
these
women
though
as
poor
as
it
is
possible
to
be
were
brahmins
and
received
us
with
the
most
gracious
charming
manners
inviting
us
to
sit
on
the
while
they
stood
before
us
with
meekly
folded
hands
the
dim
interior
of
the
hut
with
its
mud
floor
the
two
gentle
women
with
their
and
silver
anklets
looking
wonderingly
at
in
her
white
dress
sitting
enthroned
with
her
blue
eyes
shining
and
her
hair
a
halo
made
an
unforgettable
picture
of
the
east
and
the
west
we
had
tea
at
the
mission
house
and
met
several
missionary
ladies
who
told
us
much
that
was
interesting
about
their
work
which
they
seem
to
love
i
asked
one
girl
how
it
compared
with
work
among
the
poor
at
home
and
she
said
well
perhaps
it
is
the
sunshine
but
here
it
is
never
sordid
i
ca
agree
to
me
the
eternal
sunshine
makes
it
worse
at
home
although
the
poverty
and
misery
are
terrible
still
i
comfort
myself
the
poor
have
their
cosy
moments
in
winter
sometimes
when
funds
run
to
a
decent
fire
and
a
kippered
herring
to
make
a
savoury
smell
a
brown
teapot
on
the
hob
and
the
children
gathered
in
they
are
as
happy
as
possible
for
the
time
being
i
have
seen
them
i
ca
imagine
any
brightness
in
the
lives
of
the
women
we
saw
to
be
a
missionary
in
calcutta
i
think
one
would
require
to
have
an
acute
sense
of
humour
and
no
sense
of
smell
am
i
flippant
i
mean
to
be
because
i
feel
i
ca
sufficiently
admire
the
men
and
women
who
are
bearing
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
and
now
that
sounds
patronizing
and
heaven
knows
i
do
mean
to
be
that
anyway
and
i
were
never
intended
to
be
missionaries
we
drove
home
very
silent
in
the
only
vehicle
procurable
a
feeling
as
if
all
the
varied
smells
of
the
east
were
lying
heavy
on
our
chests
once
said
gloomily
how
long
does
typhoid
fever
take
to
come
out
which
made
me
laugh
weakly
most
of
the
way
home
the
day
of
our
departure
has
come
and
boggley
is
behaving
dreadfully
having
taken
time
by
the
forelock
i
am
packed
and
ready
but
boggley
has
done
nothing
he
remarked
airily
that
i
must
go
to
the
stores
and
get
some
sheets
a
new
and
a
supply
of
pots
and
pans
and
then
went
off
to
lunch
with
someone
at
the
club
leaving
me
speechless
with
rage
how
can
i
possibly
know
what
sort
of
pots
and
pans
are
wanted
i
never
camped
out
before
i
shall
calmly
finish
this
letter
and
pay
no
attention
to
his
order
we
had
a
farewell
dinner
last
night
the
ormondes
and
one
or
two
others
we
came
into
this
dismantled
room
afterwards
and
talked
till
midnight
and
amused
ourselves
vastly
i
happened
to
say
that
i
was
rather
scared
at
the
thought
of
the
wild
beasts
i
might
encounter
probably
under
my
in
the
jungle
so
a
man
captain
rawson
drew
out
a
table
for
me
to
take
with
me
into
camp
one
heave
and
a
wriggle
means
a
two
heaves
and
a
growl
a
tiger
and
so
on
so
you
can
imagine
me
in
a
tent
in
the
dead
of
night
sitting
up
anxiously
striking
matches
and
consulting
my
table
as
to
what
is
attacking
me
ormonde
who
is
so
nervous
that
if
a
cracker
goes
off
in
her
hearing
she
thinks
it
is
another
mutiny
is
anxious
that
we
should
take
guns
with
us
into
the
mofussil
in
case
we
are
attacked
picture
to
yourself
boggley
and
me
setting
out
with
a
little
hoard
of
maxims
armed
i
should
be
a
menace
alike
to
friend
and
foe
my
first
is
takai
boggley
is
going
to
some
very
place
where
it
would
be
convenient
to
take
a
female
so
when
and
russel
asked
me
to
come
to
them
while
he
is
there
i
very
gladly
accepted
the
invitation
russel
is
a
medical
missionary
i
do
know
him
but
his
wife
a
very
clever
interesting
woman
i
met
when
she
was
last
home
and
she
told
me
about
her
home
in
the
jungle
until
i
longed
to
see
it
boggley
will
come
for
me
in
about
ten
days
bella
i
shall
leave
in
calcutta
it
would
be
a
nuisance
carting
her
about
from
place
to
place
and
i
am
not
so
helpless
that
i
ca
manage
for
myself
expect
next
mail
to
receive
a
budget
of
prodigious
size
the
sunburned
earth
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
the
ideal
place
for
i
sit
here
in
the
verandah
with
long
quiet
hours
stretching
out
before
me
and
nothing
to
do
but
write
and
write
and
i
suppose
that
is
why
for
the
last
thirty
minutes
i
have
sat
nibbling
the
end
of
my
pen
and
dreaming
without
putting
pen
to
paper
where
did
i
leave
off
the
monday
we
left
calcutta
was
it
to
continue
the
said
monday
was
a
strenuous
day
boggley
absented
himself
till
late
afternoon
while
i
wrestled
with
wild
beasts
at
ephesus
in
the
shape
of
bearers
and
coolies
my
hindustani
deserting
me
utterly
as
it
always
does
at
a
crisis
desolated
at
the
thought
of
the
coming
separation
hovered
round
all
day
and
did
her
best
to
help
about
boggley
walked
in
serenely
regardless
of
the
fact
that
we
were
still
devoid
of
bed
and
table
linen
crockery
and
cooking
utensils
in
the
end
the
bearer
was
dispatched
to
the
stores
with
a
list
but
the
result
of
his
shopping
i
have
yet
seen
stayed
till
nearly
and
sang
to
us
for
a
last
time
it
was
horrid
parting
from
her
my
dear
old
do
i
write
too
much
about
her
i
thought
from
something
you
said
in
a
letter
that
perhaps
i
rather
bored
you
talking
of
her
you
see
i
like
her
so
much
and
you
can
hardly
understand
how
much
she
has
meant
to
me
since
we
left
england
together
that
showery
october
day
after
dinner
we
said
to
our
friends
in
what
boggley
irreverently
calls
the
and
at
nine
departed
to
the
station
the
bearer
was
there
with
all
the
luggage
and
the
with
the
ponies
for
we
are
taking
the
ponies
in
case
there
is
a
chance
of
polo
in
the
end
we
nearly
missed
the
train
at
the
when
we
tried
to
book
the
ponies
the
babu
in
charge
lost
his
presence
of
mind
and
turned
round
and
round
like
a
teetotum
i
was
amazed
at
boggley
patience
for
myself
i
was
conscious
of
an
intense
and
most
unladylike
desire
to
slap
the
poor
babu
i
who
have
constantly
protested
against
any
want
of
consideration
in
the
treatment
of
natives
as
i
was
the
only
lady
travelling
the
guard
was
much
against
giving
me
a
carriage
to
myself
but
a
man
who
spoke
with
authority
hearing
us
argue
came
up
and
told
him
to
put
a
ladies
only
placard
on
my
carriage
so
i
travelled
in
lonely
splendour
at
assansol
which
we
reached
at
we
had
tea
and
toast
and
most
diminutive
eggs
which
we
had
to
hold
in
our
fingers
as
there
were
no
simultala
was
my
destination
and
about
eleven
we
reached
it
underneath
the
trees
a
few
yards
away
from
the
little
station
we
found
a
which
the
russels
had
sent
for
my
luggage
and
a
doolie
for
myself
a
doolie
is
a
kind
of
hung
on
a
pole
with
a
covering
to
keep
off
the
sun
it
is
carried
by
four
men
and
two
others
run
alongside
to
relieve
their
companions
at
intervals
i
had
sixteen
miles
to
travel
in
this
thing
i
looked
at
boggley
very
doubtfully
and
he
tried
to
encourage
me
it
is
really
quite
comfortable
he
said
and
when
he
said
so
he
lied
and
the
men
go
very
fast
you
will
be
there
in
no
time
so
i
bundled
in
somehow
said
a
wistful
to
boggley
and
we
started
i
ca
honestly
say
i
like
a
doolie
i
would
rather
have
been
my
luggage
and
gone
in
the
whichever
way
i
lay
i
very
soon
got
an
ache
in
my
back
the
conduct
too
of
the
coolies
filled
me
with
uneasiness
they
kept
up
a
continued
groaning
one
said
oh
oh
oh
and
the
other
replied
oo
oo
oo
and
you
think
what
a
depressing
sound
it
was
i
know
now
that
always
make
that
noise
when
on
duty
it
seems
to
keep
up
their
hearts
so
to
speak
and
cheer
them
on
feeling
guiltily
that
it
was
my
weight
that
made
them
groan
i
lay
perfectly
still
and
was
even
holding
my
breath
in
an
effort
to
make
myself
lighter
when
for
no
apparent
reason
we
left
the
road
such
as
it
was
and
started
across
the
trackless
plain
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
except
an
infrequent
bush
no
trace
of
a
human
habitation
nothing
but
the
wind
blowing
and
the
grass
growing
awful
thoughts
began
to
come
into
my
head
i
was
all
alone
in
india
indeed
worse
than
alone
i
was
in
the
company
of
six
natives
most
inadequately
clothed
of
their
language
i
knew
not
one
single
word
i
did
even
know
if
they
were
carrying
me
in
the
direction
i
wanted
to
go
suddenly
the
groaning
ceased
and
i
found
myself
and
the
doolie
planted
on
the
ground
my
bright
young
life
to
be
ended
cold
with
terror
i
shut
my
eyes
tight
and
when
i
opened
them
i
found
all
the
six
coolies
squatted
round
all
talking
at
once
all
presumably
addressing
me
i
made
out
one
word
which
was
repeated
often
reminding
myself
that
i
was
of
the
dominant
race
i
sat
up
and
waving
a
hand
towards
the
horizon
said
sternly
jao
i
do
think
i
must
have
intimidated
them
for
they
meekly
picked
me
up
again
and
we
resumed
our
journey
the
longest
lane
turns
the
darkest
night
wears
on
to
dawn
the
weariest
river
winds
at
last
to
the
sea
and
about
aching
dishevelled
hungry
having
had
nothing
but
a
few
chocolates
since
at
i
was
deposited
before
the
verandah
of
the
russels
bungalow
i
do
suppose
you
know
anything
about
mission
work
neither
do
i
which
is
very
shocking
as
i
have
had
every
opportunity
of
acquiring
information
perhaps
as
a
child
i
was
taken
to
too
many
missionary
meetings
with
their
atmosphere
of
hot
tea
and
sentiment
and
heard
too
much
of
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
mission
field
for
i
grieve
to
say
before
i
came
to
india
i
quite
actively
disliked
missionaries
and
thought
them
a
feeble
folk
mother
was
the
only
kind
of
missionary
i
liked
she
has
a
mission
so
we
tell
her
to
the
dreary
people
of
this
world
not
the
very
poor
they
are
vastly
entertaining
but
the
highly
respectable
deadly
dull
people
with
awkward
unlovable
manners
whom
no
one
cares
very
much
to
visit
or
to
ask
to
things
and
who
must
often
feel
very
lonely
and
neglected
while
others
are
taken
up
with
more
entertaining
company
mother
has
time
to
trot
to
these
people
with
a
new
book
or
magazine
or
merely
to
talk
for
half
an
hour
in
the
funny
bright
way
which
is
like
no
one
else
way
has
them
to
the
house
to
meet
interesting
people
in
spite
of
the
remonstrant
groans
of
the
family
and
having
brought
them
does
not
neglect
them
but
draws
them
out
till
they
seem
quite
brilliant
and
they
go
away
warmed
and
enlivened
by
their
social
success
even
the
most
determined
distruster
of
missions
could
stay
long
at
takai
without
being
converted
russel
very
far
from
being
feeble
is
a
most
able
man
who
would
have
made
his
mark
in
his
profession
at
home
but
he
prefers
healing
the
bodies
and
saving
the
souls
of
the
santals
in
the
jungle
to
building
up
a
lucrative
practice
and
even
attaining
the
dizzy
height
of
a
knighthood
to
heal
their
poor
neglected
bodies
to
be
the
first
to
tell
them
of
jesus
how
did
festus
put
it
one
jesus
which
is
dead
whom
paul
affirmed
to
be
alive
to
teach
them
to
help
and
raise
them
until
life
becomes
for
these
natives
a
new
and
thing
one
can
see
how
fine
it
is
how
russel
has
built
a
hospital
and
the
natives
come
from
far
and
near
bringing
their
sick
as
i
sit
here
writing
they
come
trooping
past
taking
a
short
cut
past
the
bungalow
stopping
to
stare
at
me
quite
unabashed
sometimes
carrying
a
sick
child
sometimes
a
blind
old
man
or
woman
they
know
they
can
come
at
any
time
and
the
padre
sahib
will
never
tell
them
to
go
away
it
is
different
with
a
government
official
he
is
hedged
round
by
who
levy
toll
on
the
poor
natives
before
they
allow
them
to
enter
the
presence
of
the
sahib
it
is
a
scandal
but
it
seems
impossible
to
stop
it
you
may
catch
a
in
the
act
you
may
beat
him
and
insist
on
his
handing
back
the
money
but
almost
before
your
back
is
turned
the
annas
or
pice
have
changed
hands
again
it
is
my
first
view
of
the
hospital
was
rather
a
shock
nothing
was
what
i
had
expected
the
beds
are
square
blocks
of
cement
without
even
a
mattress
the
patients
bring
their
own
bedding
and
their
cooking
pots
and
pans
and
generally
a
friend
to
look
after
them
the
said
friends
camp
all
round
the
hospital
and
it
is
pretty
to
see
them
at
sunset
each
cooking
his
evening
meal
over
his
own
little
fire
this
morning
being
sunday
i
went
to
a
service
at
the
hospital
the
mingled
smell
of
carbolic
hookahs
and
oil
was
i
confess
rather
overpowering
but
when
russel
asked
me
is
this
at
all
interesting
to
you
or
is
it
merely
disgusting
i
could
reply
truthfully
that
it
was
more
interesting
than
disgusting
the
patients
sat
rolled
up
in
their
blankets
and
listened
while
the
tale
of
the
prodigal
son
was
read
to
them
holding
up
their
hands
in
horror
when
they
heard
he
herded
swine
they
regard
that
as
a
very
low
job
indeed
it
is
odd
the
way
they
respond
just
as
if
during
church
service
at
home
a
man
were
to
answer
each
statement
made
by
the
clergyman
right
you
are
coming
home
we
saw
a
native
cooking
his
dinner
on
a
little
charcoal
fire
and
as
i
passed
he
threw
the
contents
of
the
pot
away
surprised
i
asked
why
because
i
was
told
your
shadow
fell
on
it
and
defiled
it
one
can
hardly
overestimate
the
boon
a
man
like
russel
is
to
a
district
trust
is
a
plant
of
slow
growth
with
the
natives
but
they
have
learned
to
trust
him
entirely
and
go
to
him
in
all
their
troubles
as
children
go
to
a
father
and
he
has
a
very
real
helpmate
in
his
wife
i
never
saw
such
a
busy
woman
if
she
is
in
the
hospital
helping
at
operations
she
has
a
medical
degree
she
is
teaching
girls
to
sew
or
women
to
read
and
yet
the
children
are
beautifully
cared
for
and
the
house
excellently
managed
i
suppose
most
women
would
pity
russel
sincerely
she
passes
her
life
in
a
place
many
miles
from
another
european
with
absolutely
no
society
no
gaieties
no
theatres
not
even
shops
where
she
can
while
away
the
time
buying
things
she
does
want
yet
i
never
met
a
woman
so
utterly
satisfied
with
her
lot
honestly
i
do
think
she
has
a
single
thing
left
to
wish
for
devoted
to
her
husband
devoted
to
her
children
heart
and
soul
in
her
work
if
only
she
sometimes
says
it
would
go
on
the
children
will
have
to
go
home
very
soon
the
tragedy
of
life
they
are
such
dear
children
ronald
and
robert
and
tiny
jean
the
boys
speak
santali
like
little
natives
and
even
their
english
has
an
odd
turn
when
little
jean
was
born
they
were
greatly
interested
in
the
first
white
baby
they
had
seen
and
ronald
said
rapturously
oh
mummy
are
ladies
darlings
when
they
are
babies
their
mother
found
them
one
day
bending
over
the
cradle
arguing
as
to
why
the
baby
cried
ronald
said
she
has
no
teeth
for
that
reason
she
cries
robert
said
she
has
no
hair
for
that
reason
she
cries
and
ronald
finished
she
has
no
english
for
that
reason
she
cries
i
am
not
the
only
visitor
at
takai
there
are
two
missionary
ladies
here
resting
after
a
strenuous
time
in
some
famine
district
one
is
tall
and
stout
the
other
is
short
and
thin
both
have
faces
and
straight
hair
both
wear
and
sort
of
up
and
down
dresses
the
very
best
of
women
one
feels
sure
but
oh
so
difficult
you
know
my
weakness
for
making
people
like
me
but
these
dear
ladies
will
have
none
of
me
charm
i
never
so
wisely
everything
i
do
meets
with
their
disapproval
how
well
i
see
it
in
their
averted
spectacled
eyes
i
talk
too
much
laugh
too
much
tell
foolish
tales
mimic
my
elders
and
betters
and
worst
sin
of
all
i
have
never
read
never
even
heard
of
the
something
you
said
in
your
last
letter
some
allusion
to
religion
i
did
quite
like
and
at
any
other
time
i
would
have
written
you
a
sermon
on
the
subject
in
calcutta
where
i
felt
so
nothing
would
have
prevented
me
but
now
i
have
the
spirit
mark
please
how
the
whirligig
of
time
brings
its
revenges
in
calcutta
i
thought
myself
a
saint
in
takai
i
am
regarded
as
a
brand
unplucked
it
is
rather
dispiriting
i
am
beginning
to
wonder
if
i
really
am
as
nice
as
i
thought
i
was
this
gorgeous
east
is
a
cold
and
draughty
place
we
have
in
the
verandah
at
and
at
that
early
hour
it
is
so
cold
my
blue
fingers
will
hardly
lift
the
cup
now
the
sun
is
beginning
to
warm
things
into
life
again
and
i
have
been
sitting
outside
basking
in
its
rays
to
the
anxiety
of
russel
who
like
all
has
a
profound
respect
for
the
power
of
the
eastern
sun
the
children
are
taught
that
one
thing
they
must
not
do
is
to
run
out
without
a
topi
they
were
looking
over
pilgrim
with
me
and
at
a
picture
of
christian
bareheaded
approaching
the
celestial
city
with
the
rays
of
the
sun
very
much
in
evidence
robert
pointed
an
accusing
finger
saying
john
bunyan
you
in
the
sun
without
your
topi
the
poor
santals
must
feel
dreadfully
cold
just
now
especially
the
children
who
have
hardly
anything
on
russel
has
a
big
trunk
full
of
things
sent
out
from
home
as
presents
to
the
mission
pieces
of
calico
and
various
kinds
of
garments
and
these
are
given
as
prizes
to
the
children
who
attend
the
christian
schools
the
pieces
of
cloth
which
they
can
wind
round
them
are
the
most
valued
prizes
some
of
the
garments
are
too
ridiculous
shapeless
sacks
of
pink
flannelette
intended
i
suppose
for
shirts
and
this
morning
there
was
a
the
big
trunk
was
brought
into
the
verandah
and
the
children
were
allowed
to
choose
one
small
boy
chose
a
of
a
material
known
i
believe
as
duffle
of
a
striking
pattern
in
this
he
arrayed
himself
with
enormous
pride
a
wide
frilled
collar
stood
out
round
his
little
thin
neck
and
to
complete
the
picture
he
carried
a
bow
and
arrow
a
quainter
figure
i
never
saw
i
only
wished
the
dorcas
who
made
the
garment
could
have
seen
him
a
little
missionary
from
somewhere
in
west
africa
once
told
me
about
a
small
orphan
native
she
had
rescued
and
adopted
i
had
him
christened
she
said
plaintively
i
had
him
christened
david
livingstone
and
i
dressed
him
in
a
blue
serge
suit
but
he
ran
away
i
murmured
sympathy
but
i
could
feel
surprised
imagine
a
little
heathen
david
livingstone
in
a
hot
sticky
serge
suit
these
bows
and
arrows
by
the
way
are
rather
interesting
the
natives
make
them
of
bamboo
and
strips
of
hide
and
they
are
tipped
with
iron
they
really
shoot
things
with
them
birds
and
wild
animals
i
mean
i
bought
one
from
the
owner
of
the
for
four
annas
to
take
home
to
peter
it
seemed
very
little
for
a
real
bow
and
arrow
but
russel
said
it
was
quite
enough
and
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
it
is
double
a
man
day
wage
i
enjoying
myself
at
takai
as
the
man
said
when
he
lost
his
wife
it
verra
quiet
but
verra
peacefu
after
calcutta
the
quiet
does
seem
almost
uncanny
it
is
a
blameless
existence
one
leads
i
think
i
would
soon
grow
very
good
for
there
is
no
temptation
to
be
anything
else
one
ca
be
very
frivolous
when
there
is
no
one
to
be
frivolous
with
nor
can
one
backbite
and
be
unkind
for
there
is
no
provocation
as
for
being
vain
and
fond
of
the
putting
on
of
apparel
what
is
the
good
when
one
is
the
best
people
if
one
wears
a
garment
of
any
description
although
there
is
nothing
to
do
the
days
never
seem
too
long
after
i
generally
go
for
a
walk
with
the
children
there
is
one
good
broad
road
passing
the
bungalow
which
leads
away
to
the
back
of
beyond
but
we
prefer
the
little
tracks
worn
by
the
feet
of
the
natives
which
everywhere
jean
wo
stir
a
step
without
a
horrid
dilapidated
rag
doll
called
topsy
i
do
dislike
the
faces
of
rag
dolls
their
lack
of
profile
is
so
gruesome
and
topsy
is
a
most
depressing
specimen
of
her
kind
but
jean
lavishes
affection
on
her
a
is
an
odd
thing
i
remember
being
taken
into
a
shop
to
choose
a
doll
and
i
chose
a
most
hideous
thing
with
curly
white
hair
no
one
could
understand
why
and
i
was
too
shy
to
tell
it
was
because
the
doll
was
so
ugly
i
felt
sure
no
one
would
buy
her
and
i
bear
to
think
of
her
loneliness
the
boys
christened
her
smilie
after
a
lady
of
that
name
whom
they
thought
she
resembled
and
the
poor
thing
came
to
a
tragic
end
they
were
playing
at
the
execution
of
mary
queen
of
scots
in
the
shrubbery
seized
on
smilie
to
play
the
title
r√¥le
and
with
brutal
realism
chopped
off
her
poor
ugly
head
i
arrived
just
in
time
to
see
the
deed
and
rushed
swiftly
with
fists
and
feet
to
avenge
her
fate
well
we
set
off
every
morning
on
our
pilgrimage
jean
calling
herself
jones
and
walking
primly
till
we
reach
what
we
pretend
is
the
seashore
where
she
forgets
her
dignity
and
rolls
about
in
the
sand
a
certain
kind
of
tree
that
russel
has
planted
round
about
the
bungalow
makes
a
noise
exactly
like
waves
so
it
is
easy
to
pretend
about
the
sea
we
meet
many
pilgrims
on
their
way
to
some
holy
place
and
we
create
quite
a
sensation
in
the
little
clusters
of
huts
they
could
hardly
be
called
villages
that
we
pass
through
the
inhabitants
crowd
around
us
saying
johar
which
i
take
it
is
santali
for
salaam
and
we
repeat
johar
and
grin
broadly
in
reply
and
the
pie
dogs
sniff
round
us
in
a
friendly
way
the
other
day
we
met
a
boy
who
on
beholding
me
stood
stock
still
threw
back
his
head
and
shouted
with
laughter
i
never
heard
more
merriment
i
had
to
join
in
whether
it
was
that
he
had
never
seen
anyone
with
fair
hair
before
or
whether
there
is
something
particularly
droll
in
my
appearance
i
do
know
but
he
evidently
found
me
the
funniest
thing
he
had
met
with
for
a
long
time
it
is
generally
topsy
who
is
the
centre
of
interest
they
hustle
one
another
to
look
at
her
and
gurgle
with
delight
jean
told
me
solemnly
i
have
to
leave
her
at
home
when
i
go
with
mummy
to
the
villages
they
wo
listen
about
jesus
for
looking
at
topsy
jean
great
desire
is
to
meet
someone
white
yesterday
i
saw
a
horseman
approaching
in
european
riding
kit
and
a
topi
look
jean
i
said
i
believe
that
is
an
englishman
but
when
he
came
up
to
us
and
raised
his
topi
with
a
flourish
jean
said
mournfully
no
nobody
white
and
i
had
to
pick
her
up
hurriedly
in
case
she
should
say
something
more
to
hurt
the
poor
eurasian
when
we
come
in
from
our
walk
it
is
after
that
the
children
are
put
to
bed
and
i
sit
in
the
verandah
and
write
and
rest
did
i
say
rest
this
is
what
goes
on
i
go
into
the
nursery
and
jean
very
wide
awake
demands
a
needle
and
thread
as
she
wants
to
sew
a
dress
for
topsy
i
tie
a
piece
of
thread
into
a
large
and
supply
her
with
my
handkerchief
which
she
proceeds
to
sew
into
a
tight
ball
i
return
to
my
writing
olivia
this
time
it
is
robert
olivia
if
this
bungalow
fell
into
the
tank
would
it
splash
out
all
the
water
of
course
it
would
then
what
would
the
water
do
when
it
fell
back
from
the
splash
and
found
the
bungalow
blocking
up
its
tank
unable
to
think
of
an
answer
i
tell
him
to
be
a
good
boy
and
not
disturb
people
when
they
are
writing
ronald
begs
for
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
having
got
it
proceeds
to
write
down
everything
beginning
with
i
once
told
peter
to
do
that
and
his
list
when
i
looked
at
it
ran
god
gollywog
gordon
immediately
i
resume
my
writing
it
begins
again
olivia
in
every
tone
peremptory
beseeching
coaxing
but
like
the
deaf
adder
i
stop
my
ears
and
refuse
to
hear
i
am
using
this
opportunity
to
write
my
great
work
on
the
mutiny
and
it
is
nearly
so
easy
to
write
a
book
as
i
thought
no
matter
how
much
i
try
my
sentences
seem
all
to
stand
up
on
end
i
ca
acquire
any
ease
or
grace
of
style
i
read
somewhere
lately
that
young
writers
use
too
many
adjectives
that
good
writers
depend
more
on
verbs
it
has
made
me
rather
nervous
and
i
keep
counting
both
but
a
certain
dubiety
in
my
own
mind
as
to
which
is
which
greatly
complicates
matters
my
heroine
too
is
a
failure
i
like
her
name
belinda
but
it
is
the
only
thing
i
like
about
her
what
is
the
good
of
me
laboriously
writing
down
that
she
is
beautiful
and
charming
when
i
am
convinced
in
my
own
mind
she
is
nothing
of
the
kind
however
i
mean
to
persevere
we
all
meet
at
tea
the
nicest
time
of
the
day
i
think
my
friend
katie
says
the
world
is
properly
warmed
up
till
five
and
certainly
there
is
a
feeling
of
comfort
all
over
everything
at
the
clink
of
the
teacups
russel
being
scots
knows
how
to
give
a
proper
tea
with
plates
and
knives
and
scones
and
jam
and
i
am
as
greedy
as
a
schoolboy
over
it
yesterday
there
was
no
milk
such
a
blow
the
cows
had
wandered
into
a
man
land
and
he
as
the
custom
is
marched
them
into
the
pound
five
miles
away
and
there
we
were
milkless
the
country
round
takai
is
quite
pretty
almost
like
scots
moorland
yesterday
we
went
for
a
picnic
to
a
river
at
the
opening
of
a
pass
a
most
interesting
place
where
not
very
long
ago
a
native
boy
had
been
eaten
by
a
tiger
you
see
picnics
in
the
jungle
are
not
quite
the
insipid
things
they
are
at
home
there
is
always
the
chance
that
the
unwary
may
be
devoured
actually
we
did
see
yesterday
the
footprints
of
a
tiger
in
the
sand
by
the
river
pugs
i
think
is
the
proper
expression
i
was
scared
but
robert
advanced
boldly
into
the
bushes
ronald
watching
him
admiringly
said
he
is
very
brave
he
is
as
brave
as
daniel
talking
about
tigers
they
are
nearly
as
prevalent
as
i
thought
i
had
an
idea
they
were
prowling
all
over
india
waiting
to
spring
but
one
man
told
me
he
had
been
in
india
fifteen
years
and
had
never
seen
one
boggley
came
on
one
once
and
took
it
for
a
cow
boggley
russel
says
there
was
a
tiger
in
the
district
lately
and
a
reward
was
offered
for
its
capture
a
young
engineer
sallied
forth
to
slay
he
directed
the
natives
to
dig
a
pit
near
where
the
tiger
was
known
to
be
and
cover
it
with
branches
and
the
next
day
went
and
found
it
had
walked
into
the
trap
the
natives
removed
the
branches
the
gallant
engineer
approached
but
they
had
dug
the
pit
on
a
slope
and
the
tiger
walking
up
to
meet
him
i
would
rather
like
to
see
a
wild
beast
from
a
safe
distance
a
native
came
into
hospital
only
yesterday
with
his
arm
all
torn
and
mauled
by
a
leopard
but
though
i
have
walked
miles
through
the
jungle
i
have
seen
nothing
more
fearsome
than
a
and
i
might
have
seen
at
home
the
santals
are
very
keen
and
go
regularly
to
hunt
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
and
a
few
guns
one
morning
i
watched
them
start
with
them
was
a
youth
home
on
holiday
from
a
situation
in
calcutta
i
liked
his
idea
of
a
shooting
costume
he
wore
a
pair
of
bright
blue
socks
and
yellow
shoes
a
pink
shirt
worn
over
a
dhoti
and
over
that
a
tweed
coat
evidently
an
old
one
of
his
master
a
high
linen
collar
but
no
tie
a
straw
hat
and
enormous
blue
spectacles
the
were
evidently
worn
more
for
effect
than
by
order
of
the
oculist
for
the
youth
removed
them
when
the
time
came
to
use
his
gun
my
home
mail
has
just
come
in
i
like
to
be
in
the
verandah
to
see
the
bring
in
the
letters
i
hear
him
long
before
i
see
him
for
he
carries
a
stick
with
jingling
bells
at
the
end
to
frighten
away
animals
as
he
comes
through
the
jungle
mine
was
a
particularly
nice
mail
good
news
from
everyone
you
have
no
idea
how
out
here
one
loves
to
get
letters
and
how
one
gloats
over
every
scrap
of
news
do
you
really
look
forward
to
my
letters
your
letters
are
the
greatest
comfort
to
me
indeed
i
ca
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
without
them
i
must
finish
this
up
for
the
mail
goes
my
time
here
is
nearly
run
i
hear
from
boggley
that
he
expects
to
arrive
and
we
depart
together
the
next
day
i
shall
be
sorry
and
glad
both
sorry
to
leave
takai
and
the
dear
people
more
than
glad
to
be
with
boggley
robert
has
just
come
in
excitedly
clutching
the
tail
of
a
lizard
he
had
caught
it
going
up
the
wall
and
the
lizard
had
wriggled
away
and
left
its
tail
now
i
suppose
it
will
perseveringly
grow
another
robert
is
holding
the
tail
before
jean
that
she
may
see
it
wriggle
and
saying
god
made
it
so
it
clever
the
dear
babies
how
i
shall
miss
them
house
lakserai
jan
this
letter
must
begin
in
pencil
for
boggley
has
the
only
pen
by
the
bye
would
you
mind
keeping
my
letters
till
i
get
home
i
think
it
might
be
amusing
to
read
them
when
my
cold
weather
in
india
is
a
thing
of
the
past
behold
us
on
the
first
stage
of
our
wanderings
we
left
takai
on
wednesday
i
in
my
old
friend
the
doolie
boggley
on
his
bicycle
it
is
wonderful
where
a
bicycle
can
go
in
india
i
was
much
sorrier
to
leave
takai
than
i
thought
i
should
be
and
i
think
they
were
a
little
sorry
to
see
me
go
even
the
missionary
ladies
unbent
so
far
as
to
say
they
would
miss
my
bright
face
and
merry
chatter
how
differently
people
describe
things
bright
and
merry
are
hardly
the
adjectives
i
should
have
applied
to
my
soulful
countenance
and
brilliant
conversation
but
no
matter
they
all
stood
on
the
verandah
to
watch
us
go
russel
dear
woman
was
obviously
sincerely
sorry
for
anyone
leaving
such
a
delectable
spot
as
takai
and
indeed
there
are
many
worse
places
the
boys
grinned
benignly
each
hopping
on
one
foot
robert
looking
rather
like
a
toadstool
with
his
topi
and
thin
legs
said
i
going
to
scotland
soon
and
i
not
coming
back
to
india
till
i
have
a
long
beard
just
as
we
were
starting
an
object
hurtled
through
the
air
and
fell
at
my
feet
and
jean
voice
explained
it
is
topsy
olivia
you
may
have
her
then
but
she
buried
her
head
in
her
mother
lap
i
am
rather
as
our
old
nurse
used
to
say
at
any
time
and
i
saw
things
through
a
mist
for
the
first
mile
or
two
it
did
seem
nearly
such
a
long
way
going
to
the
station
as
coming
from
it
but
boggley
on
his
bicycle
was
there
long
before
me
and
my
doolie
men
we
got
a
train
to
wherever
we
were
going
to
about
five
i
had
some
sandwiches
with
me
and
we
got
tea
handed
in
at
a
station
it
tasted
of
musty
straw
and
boggley
said
the
milk
safe
but
the
cups
made
up
for
everything
boggley
bore
the
legend
and
mine
present
for
a
good
in
gilt
letters
about
eight
we
came
to
another
station
it
is
quite
impossible
to
remember
their
ridiculous
names
and
got
out
it
was
quite
an
important
station
and
the
large
had
a
long
table
set
for
dinner
lining
the
walls
of
the
room
were
tall
glass
cases
filled
with
tinned
meats
jam
biscuits
and
other
eatables
for
in
the
mofussil
provisions
are
bought
at
the
railway
stations
after
dinner
boggley
produced
a
pencil
and
sheet
of
paper
now
he
said
we
must
make
a
list
of
provisions
wanted
so
we
sat
on
the
table
and
laid
our
heads
together
we
begin
with
necessaries
said
boggley
butter
jam
i
added
and
cheese
these
being
put
down
we
could
think
of
another
single
thing
go
on
said
boggley
biting
his
pencil
that
ca
be
all
biscuits
i
said
with
a
flash
of
inspiration
and
we
chose
three
boxes
of
biscuits
and
stuck
again
when
the
attendant
produced
a
list
of
provisions
kept
we
got
on
better
and
soon
had
two
large
wooden
boxes
packed
with
things
that
sounded
as
if
they
might
taste
good
the
only
thing
i
do
feel
we
have
been
extravagant
in
is
mustard
it
is
an
enormous
tin
and
one
really
eat
such
a
vast
deal
of
mustard
the
list
finished
and
approved
i
asked
when
our
train
came
in
about
said
boggley
this
was
what
i
cried
aghast
where
are
we
going
to
sleep
boggley
waved
his
hands
comprehensively
anywhere
he
said
see
what
the
is
like
the
was
like
nothing
i
had
ever
seen
before
a
large
dirty
apartment
with
some
cane
seats
arranged
round
the
wall
and
an
attempt
at
a
with
a
spotty
on
it
in
one
corner
one
small
lamp
smelling
vilely
served
to
make
darkness
visible
and
an
old
hag
crouching
at
the
door
was
the
attendant
spirit
it
does
sound
cheery
does
it
the
bearer
autolycus
by
name
i
call
him
autolycus
not
because
he
is
a
knave
and
witty
but
because
he
is
such
a
of
unconsidered
trifles
made
up
a
bed
on
one
of
the
cane
seats
and
there
in
that
dreary
and
far
from
clean
apartment
with
horrible
insects
walking
up
the
walls
and
doubtless
carpeting
the
floor
with
no
lock
on
the
door
and
unknown
horrors
without
i
slept
dreamlessly
my
last
waking
thought
was
i
wish
my
mother
could
see
me
now
boggley
slept
in
the
autolycus
had
gone
to
the
stationmaster
and
demanded
a
bed
for
a
commissioner
sahib
and
so
far
does
impudence
carry
one
got
it
i
was
awakened
at
and
the
aged
crone
helped
me
to
pack
up
my
bedding
i
gave
her
a
rupee
which
afterwards
i
regretted
when
autolycus
pointed
out
she
had
stolen
a
sheet
we
crossed
the
ganges
in
the
grey
dawn
a
clammy
fog
shrouding
everything
nothing
was
visible
but
a
stretch
of
wan
water
and
one
or
two
natives
near
the
bank
bathing
in
the
holy
river
we
were
the
only
europeans
travelling
till
at
one
station
a
nice
old
priest
came
in
of
what
nationality
we
could
make
out
i
was
pondering
it
when
i
discovered
that
my
bangle
with
the
miniature
which
i
always
wear
was
on
my
wrist
we
looked
up
and
down
and
round
about
and
then
i
shouted
why
there
it
is
and
there
it
was
lying
on
the
lap
he
looked
so
utterly
dumbfoundered
poor
dear
man
and
blushed
all
over
his
fat
face
and
i
when
i
realized
i
had
pointed
an
accusing
finger
was
also
covered
with
confusion
we
tried
to
explain
that
it
had
come
off
with
my
glove
but
he
merely
bowed
repeatedly
and
made
hurt
ejaculations
in
some
unknown
tongue
so
we
were
reduced
to
an
uneasy
silence
about
twelve
we
had
breakfast
in
the
of
a
station
we
had
wired
for
it
so
it
was
ready
first
we
got
ham
and
eggs
the
ham
was
evidently
tinned
and
the
eggs
were
quite
black
i
poked
my
share
suspiciously
and
asked
what
made
it
so
black
pepper
said
boggley
who
was
eating
away
quite
placidly
pepper
as
if
i
could
recognize
plain
dirt
when
i
saw
it
our
plates
were
the
kind
with
hot
water
inside
and
a
cork
and
as
the
venerable
man
removed
them
for
the
next
course
i
watching
saw
him
wipe
them
perfunctorily
with
the
corner
of
his
already
none
too
clean
garment
then
gravely
hand
them
back
after
that
i
thought
dry
bread
was
the
safest
thing
to
breakfast
on
now
we
are
installed
in
lakserai
circuit
house
these
are
kept
up
by
the
government
for
officials
on
inspection
duty
are
rather
different
any
traveller
may
stay
in
them
by
paying
so
much
this
house
consists
of
one
very
large
room
dining
drawing
smoking
room
in
one
and
two
bedrooms
it
is
rather
damp
and
dreary
but
that
does
matter
for
we
leave
again
morning
we
have
been
to
call
this
afternoon
on
the
wife
of
the
collector
edston
a
pretty
woman
with
nice
manners
and
a
sweet
voice
we
had
tea
with
her
and
saw
her
small
son
her
bungalow
interested
me
it
was
only
the
second
mofussil
bungalow
i
had
seen
the
takai
was
delightful
a
big
rather
empty
room
with
one
or
two
good
reproductions
of
famous
pictures
on
the
walls
heaps
of
books
and
an
almost
entire
absence
of
ornaments
rather
an
ascetic
room
it
suited
the
simple
strenuous
life
there
edston
is
quite
different
bright
and
pretty
full
of
flowers
and
growing
plants
tables
laden
with
silver
and
photographs
of
pretty
women
and
children
comfortable
chairs
with
opulent
cushions
soft
rugs
and
hangings
altogether
a
very
cosy
room
edston
has
kindly
asked
us
to
dine
with
her
we
have
just
come
back
and
as
i
am
not
very
sleepy
i
shall
write
a
bit
it
was
pouring
rain
at
eight
so
a
trap
was
sent
for
us
and
a
note
asking
us
not
to
whip
the
horses
too
hard
i
thought
they
must
be
very
restive
animals
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
joke
there
were
no
horses
in
the
trap
only
coolies
we
had
a
very
pleasant
dinner
edston
is
out
in
camp
but
two
young
assistant
officers
were
there
they
live
in
tents
in
the
compound
as
the
bungalow
is
small
and
have
their
meals
with
the
edstons
sitting
before
a
blazing
fire
in
the
pretty
listening
to
edston
singing
i
reflected
that
they
were
exceedingly
fortunate
young
men
to
have
such
a
habitation
and
such
a
charming
hostess
to
do
them
justice
i
think
they
quite
realize
their
good
fortune
we
depart
morning
for
some
quite
unpronounceable
place
about
twenty
miles
from
here
to
stay
at
another
till
monday
we
have
reached
the
unpronounceable
place
after
much
prayer
and
fasting
what
a
day
we
had
yesterday
we
left
the
lakserai
circuit
house
at
preceded
by
autolycus
and
a
crowd
of
coolies
bearing
luggage
each
coolie
carries
one
thing
and
as
they
are
all
paid
the
same
without
regard
to
the
weight
carried
of
course
there
is
great
competition
for
the
light
packages
it
is
odd
to
see
one
man
stagger
under
a
trunk
while
another
trots
gaily
off
with
a
cushion
or
a
kodak
we
are
allowed
to
take
into
the
carriage
and
we
take
such
a
broad
view
of
the
word
that
it
means
with
us
and
as
much
more
as
the
compartment
will
hold
the
station
when
we
reached
it
yesterday
was
crammed
with
natives
squatting
so
thick
on
the
platform
one
could
hardly
move
without
treading
on
them
a
great
festival
is
going
on
which
only
happens
once
in
a
long
time
fifty
years
i
think
and
if
they
bathe
in
the
holy
ganges
while
the
festival
lasts
all
their
sins
are
washed
away
they
are
flocking
from
all
parts
eagerly
boarding
every
train
that
stops
regardless
of
the
direction
it
is
going
in
the
festival
ends
at
twelve
so
i
greatly
fear
many
will
be
disappointed
at
all
times
the
native
loves
railway
travelling
and
as
he
has
no
notion
of
he
often
arrives
at
the
station
the
night
before
sleeps
peacefully
on
the
ground
and
is
in
comfortable
time
for
the
first
train
in
the
morning
also
he
has
no
idea
of
fixed
charges
and
when
he
goes
to
the
and
asks
for
his
tickut
and
the
babu
in
charge
tells
him
the
price
he
offers
half
when
that
is
refused
he
goes
away
and
returns
in
an
hour
or
so
and
offers
a
little
more
it
may
take
a
whole
day
to
convince
a
native
that
he
ca
beat
down
the
railway
company
this
festival
had
so
disarranged
the
trains
that
our
train
which
should
have
left
at
ten
did
come
in
till
twelve
then
we
had
to
change
at
the
next
station
and
wait
for
the
connection
and
we
actually
sat
there
till
eight
in
the
evening
when
our
train
sauntered
in
they
say
of
a
certain
cold
and
draughty
station
in
scotland
that
in
it
there
is
neither
man
meat
nor
dog
meat
nor
a
place
to
sit
down
and
it
is
equally
true
of
the
indian
junction
we
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
except
ginger
snaps
and
they
pall
after
a
time
especially
in
a
dry
and
dusty
land
where
no
water
is
there
were
two
other
travellers
in
the
same
plight
a
and
blackie
and
we
sat
together
through
that
long
hot
day
too
utterly
hungry
and
bored
even
to
pretend
interest
in
each
other
when
the
train
did
come
in
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
engine
and
they
lost
more
time
pottering
about
with
it
tying
it
up
with
string
probably
it
was
then
that
my
temper
and
i
do
think
i
behaved
with
great
fortitude
up
to
that
time
gave
way
and
i
tried
to
bully
the
officials
it
was
no
use
they
merely
smiled
and
said
and
boggley
irritated
me
more
and
more
by
solemnly
repeating
it
is
not
good
for
the
christian
soul
to
hustle
the
aryan
brown
for
the
christian
riles
and
the
heathen
smiles
and
it
weareth
the
christian
down
and
the
end
of
the
fight
is
a
tombstone
white
with
the
name
of
the
dear
deceased
and
the
epitaph
drear
fool
lies
here
who
tried
to
hustle
the
east
we
had
nothing
to
look
forward
to
at
the
end
of
the
journey
except
a
cold
welcome
but
the
blackies
who
live
at
madhabad
insisted
we
should
go
home
with
them
to
dinner
so
instead
of
the
tinned
meal
we
had
expected
we
had
a
dainty
dinner
in
a
cosy
warmed
and
fed
we
retired
to
our
present
and
found
little
comfort
here
autolycus
and
his
coolies
had
only
just
arrived
and
autolycus
was
searching
vainly
for
a
lamp
a
he
called
it
the
floors
are
stone
and
as
cold
as
the
tomb
blackie
begged
us
to
go
back
to
his
place
for
the
night
but
we
would
hear
of
it
autolycus
ran
a
lamp
to
earth
we
explored
for
bedrooms
and
found
two
in
which
he
hastily
made
up
beds
they
are
damp
and
far
from
clean
but
one
learns
to
put
up
with
a
lot
in
the
mofussil
and
in
a
very
short
time
we
had
forgotten
our
troubles
in
sleep
this
morning
i
rose
betimes
and
went
out
to
the
verandah
and
there
i
found
quite
suddenly
a
handsome
young
man
it
seems
he
too
is
staying
in
this
eligible
mansion
he
is
an
engineer
a
i
think
and
this
is
convenient
for
his
present
work
he
was
in
bed
and
asleep
and
did
hear
us
arrive
last
night
so
he
was
as
surprised
to
see
me
as
i
was
to
see
him
when
boggley
appeared
we
had
breakfast
together
it
was
interesting
hearing
about
the
kind
of
life
this
young
man
leads
he
says
although
madhabad
is
not
gay
it
is
piccadilly
compared
to
where
he
often
is
out
in
camp
forty
miles
from
another
european
with
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
from
week
to
week
the
evenings
are
the
dreariest
times
and
he
often
goes
to
bed
immediately
after
dinner
he
was
quite
cheerful
and
said
he
liked
the
life
madhabad
is
a
large
village
but
the
blackies
are
the
only
europeans
there
are
a
lot
of
planters
however
living
round
about
we
had
callers
this
morning
royle
to
whose
place
we
go
on
monday
rode
over
with
his
two
small
daughters
to
say
they
would
expect
us
to
stay
with
them
we
meant
to
camp
but
it
will
be
much
pleasanter
to
stay
with
the
royles
everyone
says
they
are
charming
people
boggley
and
i
went
for
a
walk
after
tea
to
see
the
country
there
is
much
to
see
except
a
long
straight
brown
road
and
a
most
tank
the
village
is
more
interesting
with
its
queer
booths
i
do
think
it
is
an
incongruous
sight
to
see
as
i
saw
this
afternoon
a
native
naked
but
for
a
loin
cloth
plying
a
singer
the
natives
looked
sullen
and
rather
suspicious
or
is
it
only
that
i
imagine
it
because
they
are
so
unlike
the
santals
with
their
cheerful
there
are
four
trees
before
this
bungalow
and
at
present
two
vultures
are
perching
on
each
horrible
creatures
with
long
scraggy
necks
i
pointed
them
out
to
boggley
who
was
immediately
reminded
of
a
tale
of
a
bumptious
young
civilian
new
to
the
country
who
was
told
by
one
who
had
suffered
many
things
at
his
hands
that
the
birds
were
wild
turkeys
a
delicacy
hearing
which
the
youth
promptly
shot
some
and
sent
them
round
to
the
ladies
of
the
station
do
you
believe
that
tale
i
do
we
have
just
finished
dinner
much
the
most
amusing
dinner
i
ever
ate
there
is
an
intense
rivalry
it
seems
between
our
cook
and
the
cook
and
although
we
dined
together
our
were
kept
jealously
apart
autolycus
of
course
waited
on
us
and
when
he
handed
me
the
fish
and
i
helped
myself
to
one
of
the
four
pieces
he
said
sternly
two
please
and
i
meekly
took
the
other
the
engineer
had
no
fish
but
on
the
other
hand
he
had
an
entr√©e
which
was
denied
us
both
cooks
rose
to
a
savoury
they
give
you
the
savoury
before
the
sweet
if
you
insist
on
anything
else
it
so
demoralizes
them
that
the
dinner
is
a
ruin
our
savoury
was
rather
ambitious
stuffed
eggs
rolled
in
vermicelli
it
tasted
rather
like
a
and
one
felt
it
had
taken
a
lot
of
making
and
rolling
in
brown
hands
i
envied
the
simpler
poached
egg
on
tomato
of
the
engineer
you
ca
a
poached
egg
i
have
no
home
letters
to
answer
this
week
we
forgot
to
give
the
calcutta
people
the
new
address
so
on
monday
night
the
with
his
bells
would
jingle
with
my
precious
home
mail
into
the
takai
verandah
russel
having
no
other
address
would
them
back
to
calcutta
and
they
may
reach
us
here
about
sunday
it
is
tantalizing
but
i
do
pine
for
news
in
rika
so
much
as
in
most
places
i
am
so
thoroughly
at
home
i
find
the
mofussil
is
simply
full
of
nice
people
when
we
rode
out
here
on
monday
morning
and
royle
with
a
shy
small
girl
on
either
side
came
down
the
verandah
steps
to
meet
us
i
knew
i
was
going
to
love
staying
here
there
is
an
atmosphere
about
that
makes
for
peace
and
happiness
and
every
day
i
like
the
place
and
the
people
more
rika
was
rather
a
revelation
the
civilians
bungalows
have
a
look
about
them
their
owners
are
constantly
being
moved
and
pitching
their
moving
tents
elsewhere
but
the
royles
have
been
at
rika
for
fifteen
years
and
have
made
a
delightful
home
the
bungalow
is
built
on
a
slightly
rising
ground
with
a
verandah
all
round
a
verandah
made
pleasant
with
comfortable
chairs
rugs
books
and
flowers
at
one
end
a
squats
with
a
surrounded
by
white
stuff
in
various
stages
of
progress
for
the
mem
sahib
and
the
children
from
the
middle
of
the
verandah
a
broad
flight
of
steps
flanked
on
either
side
by
growing
plants
in
pots
leads
down
to
the
road
and
across
the
road
lie
the
and
the
i
have
read
that
one
of
the
most
pathetic
things
about
this
land
of
exile
is
the
useless
effort
to
make
english
flowers
grow
in
rika
they
must
feel
at
home
for
the
whole
air
is
scented
with
roses
and
mignonette
when
royle
took
us
to
see
her
flowers
boggley
pulled
a
sprig
of
mignonette
sniffed
it
appreciatively
and
handing
it
to
me
said
what
does
that
remind
you
of
miss
aitken
teas
i
said
promptly
always
that
scent
takes
me
straight
back
to
sunny
summer
afternoons
when
the
day
was
just
a
day
to
my
mind
all
sunny
before
and
sunny
behind
over
the
heather
and
myself
in
a
stiffly
starched
frock
accompanied
by
three
brothers
with
polished
faces
and
spotless
collars
setting
out
to
drink
tea
with
our
friends
miss
aitken
and
miss
elspeth
there
was
always
honey
for
tea
i
remember
honey
made
by
the
bees
that
buzzed
through
laborious
days
in
their
thatched
houses
in
a
corner
of
the
sunny
garden
and
little
round
scones
and
crisp
shortbread
and
as
we
ate
and
chattered
through
the
open
windows
the
roses
nodded
in
giving
greeting
to
their
friends
the
roses
of
past
summers
dried
and
entombed
in
great
vases
and
the
scent
of
mignonette
so
mixed
itself
with
the
sound
of
gentle
old
voices
and
childish
trebles
the
fragrant
tea
in
the
fragile
china
cups
the
prancing
dragons
in
the
cabinet
that
now
over
the
years
it
brings
them
all
back
to
me
as
surely
as
potently
as
if
it
had
been
indeed
a
sprig
of
oberon
wild
thyme
or
ophelia
rosemary
for
remembrance
as
i
have
told
you
we
were
naughty
children
sometimes
even
wicked
children
but
our
conduct
at
this
house
was
humanly
speaking
perfect
the
old
ladies
listened
so
sympathetically
to
our
tales
of
how
many
trout
we
had
that
day
in
the
burn
of
the
colt
we
had
managed
to
catch
and
mount
as
a
family
by
the
aid
of
the
dyke
and
of
the
few
delirious
moments
spent
on
its
slippery
back
before
it
threw
us
as
a
family
of
the
ins
and
outs
of
why
boggley
nose
was
swelling
visibly
and
his
right
eye
disappearing
they
would
look
at
each
other
nodding
wisely
at
intervals
while
they
murmured
interestin
bit
bairnies
boggley
when
young
was
of
a
peculiarly
fiery
temper
at
times
one
could
hardly
look
at
him
without
being
confronted
with
squared
fists
and
being
invited
to
come
on
but
when
miss
elspeth
holding
one
of
his
pugnacious
paws
in
her
kind
soft
hands
assured
him
he
was
the
flower
of
the
flock
and
boy
he
was
a
samson
shorn
for
mildness
speaking
pure
lowland
scots
which
was
a
delight
to
listen
to
full
of
a
gracious
hospitality
embracing
everyone
in
the
district
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
fiery
politicians
and
ardent
supporters
of
their
beloved
free
kirk
to
the
upkeep
of
which
i
believe
they
would
cheerfully
have
given
their
last
copper
miss
aitken
and
miss
elspeth
were
of
a
type
now
unhappily
almost
extinct
miss
elspeth
was
the
plain
clever
one
in
my
youth
she
loved
to
quote
in
my
youth
i
wasna
what
you
would
ca
bonnie
but
i
was
pale
penetratin
and
interestin
miss
aitken
had
been
a
beauty
and
liked
to
tell
us
of
the
balls
she
had
danced
at
when
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
heelless
slippers
and
a
wreath
in
her
hair
she
had
been
called
a
sylph
why
she
had
never
married
was
a
puzzle
to
many
i
remember
she
used
to
tell
us
of
a
wonderful
visit
to
london
and
of
how
she
came
home
sick
at
heart
about
leaving
all
the
ferlies
as
she
called
them
on
her
first
evening
at
home
miss
elspeth
had
said
to
cheer
her
come
and
see
the
wee
pigs
me
said
poor
miss
aitken
what
did
i
care
about
the
wee
pigs
it
was
perhaps
more
than
the
ferlies
she
missed
but
i
do
know
she
was
no
sylph
when
i
knew
her
my
dear
miss
aitken
but
she
had
a
most
comfortable
lap
and
a
cap
with
cherry
ribbons
and
the
kindest
heart
in
all
the
world
once
john
who
thirsted
always
for
information
and
mindful
of
a
point
that
had
struck
him
in
the
chapter
at
morning
prayers
said
miss
aitken
are
you
any
relation
to
miss
elspeth
looking
quizzically
at
her
sister
answered
for
her
dod
marget
i
wouldna
wonder
but
what
ye
micht
hae
been
tempted
by
the
babylonish
garment
they
were
very
old
when
we
knew
them
these
dear
ladies
and
they
have
been
dead
many
years
but
their
simple
kindly
lives
have
left
a
fragrance
to
sweeten
this
workaday
world
even
as
the
mignonette
in
bygone
summers
scented
their
garden
how
i
do
reminisce
it
is
entirely
your
fault
for
saying
you
liked
it
you
know
it
is
a
trait
in
the
douglas
family
our
way
of
entertaining
guests
is
to
sit
close
together
and
recall
happenings
and
delightedly
remind
each
other
of
childish
escapades
shouting
hilariously
while
our
guests
sit
in
a
bored
and
puzzled
silence
pleasant
family
the
douglases
well
as
i
said
rika
is
a
pleasant
place
and
the
royles
irish
therefore
charming
royle
is
a
most
person
i
like
to
go
with
her
in
the
morning
on
her
rounds
through
the
gardens
we
go
to
see
the
bananas
and
and
tomatoes
ripening
in
the
sun
and
make
sure
that
the
are
doing
their
work
then
on
to
the
where
the
is
finishing
the
weekly
wash
to
the
kitchens
to
see
that
the
are
clean
finally
to
stand
on
the
verandah
while
the
bring
the
ponies
and
feed
them
before
our
suspicious
eyes
i
forgot
the
henhouse
as
we
live
almost
entirely
on
fowls
in
the
mofussil
the
is
a
most
important
feature
of
the
establishment
but
just
now
i
regret
to
say
owing
to
a
moorghy
famine
in
the
district
the
stock
is
at
a
somewhat
low
ebb
men
have
been
scouring
the
country
for
fowls
but
when
we
went
to
look
at
the
result
this
morning
we
found
about
a
dozen
miserable
chickens
almost
featherless
standing
dejectedly
in
corners
and
royle
wailed
we
ca
kill
these
it
would
be
a
sheer
slaughter
of
the
innocents
it
is
easy
to
get
beef
or
mutton
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
when
a
sheep
is
brought
to
rika
it
has
to
be
carefully
concealed
or
kittiwake
ties
a
ribbon
round
its
neck
and
claims
it
as
her
own
and
terrible
is
the
outcry
if
anyone
dares
to
make
away
with
her
pet
there
are
two
royle
children
kittiwake
and
hilda
kittiwake
christened
i
believe
kathleen
helen
is
fat
and
broad
and
beaming
and
very
religious
hilda
is
inclined
to
love
the
gay
world
and
finds
rika
too
quiet
the
baby
aged
six
they
are
both
thorough
little
sportsmen
and
mounted
on
their
ponies
go
with
their
father
almost
everywhere
yesterday
i
went
for
a
ride
with
them
along
dusty
brown
roads
between
and
they
gave
me
a
wonderful
lot
of
information
about
the
place
and
the
people
as
we
passed
a
little
village
temple
kittiwake
stopped
she
said
solemnly
pointing
with
her
whip
is
where
they
worship
false
gods
i
told
royle
about
peter
being
so
anxious
for
a
mongoose
and
when
the
children
came
running
to
beg
me
to
come
quickly
and
see
what
the
fisherman
had
caught
for
me
my
mind
leapt
at
once
to
mongooses
when
i
saw
confined
under
a
wicker
basket
two
animals
with
yellow
fur
and
flat
heads
that
moved
ceaselessly
my
heart
sank
if
they
had
been
caught
for
me
how
could
i
be
so
ungracious
as
to
refuse
them
and
yet
how
was
it
possible
for
me
to
carry
these
most
terrifying
creatures
about
with
me
and
perhaps
on
the
voyage
home
have
to
share
my
cabin
with
them
i
looked
round
wildly
the
fisherman
was
grinning
delightedly
at
his
own
cleverness
our
two
autolycus
and
a
stood
round
with
the
children
all
waiting
for
my
approval
they
rather
nice
are
they
i
stammered
feebly
oh
said
hilda
rapturously
sweet
i
echoed
but
are
they
big
ones
big
cried
kittiwake
why
they
only
and
she
lifted
the
edge
of
the
basket
to
get
a
better
view
at
which
one
of
the
made
a
rush
for
the
opening
and
made
straight
at
me
with
a
yell
i
snatched
up
my
skirts
knocked
over
hilda
leapt
like
a
haarse
on
to
the
verandah
straight
into
the
astonished
royle
while
the
weird
beast
disappeared
like
a
yellow
streak
whatever
is
the
matter
he
asked
as
i
sank
to
the
floor
olivia
afraid
of
the
otter
squealed
hilda
while
she
scampered
about
looking
for
the
truant
otter
said
i
yes
said
royle
they
are
baby
otters
that
the
fisherman
found
at
the
side
of
the
lake
i
thought
of
sending
them
to
the
calcutta
zoo
they
are
very
common
in
india
i
glad
i
gasped
and
royle
looked
mystified
it
seem
exactly
a
reason
for
fervent
gladness
but
suppose
they
been
mongooses
my
life
so
to
speak
was
ruined
staying
in
the
house
with
royle
is
rather
like
being
with
colonel
newcome
in
the
flesh
he
is
such
a
very
perfect
gentil
knight
as
courteous
to
a
native
woman
as
to
the
wife
the
people
round
about
adore
him
and
his
wife
they
are
a
kind
of
father
and
mother
to
the
whole
district
there
would
be
little
heard
of
disloyalty
to
the
british
if
all
the
sahibs
were
like
royle
he
is
so
good
i
be
almost
afraid
to
be
so
good
in
case
i
died
but
not
the
least
in
a
sickly
way
he
is
a
teetotaller
a
thing
almost
unheard
of
in
india
and
he
is
ashamed
to
be
heard
singing
hymns
with
the
children
before
their
yet
why
yet
he
is
a
crack
shot
a
fine
polo
player
an
sportsman
both
he
and
his
wife
are
very
fond
of
books
royle
reads
everything
she
can
lay
her
hands
on
but
her
husband
special
subject
is
philosophy
and
last
night
he
lent
me
a
volume
of
nietzsche
i
do
think
i
understood
a
single
word
but
between
it
and
the
i
had
a
bad
night
i
thought
i
had
to
make
in
five
minutes
a
new
scheme
of
the
universe
all
the
pieces
were
lying
about
like
a
and
i
feverishly
tried
to
make
them
fit
in
the
clumsy
ineffective
way
one
does
things
in
dreams
just
as
i
had
it
almost
finished
royle
came
with
a
fowl
in
each
hand
and
said
sternly
these
must
come
into
your
scheme
i
took
the
two
great
clucking
things
and
vainly
tried
to
thrust
their
feet
or
is
it
claws
hens
have
into
a
tiny
corner
and
they
had
just
wrecked
all
my
efforts
when
i
woke
i
have
taken
some
photographs
which
i
shall
send
you
the
delightful
babu
buttoned
tightly
into
the
is
a
clerk
of
royle
called
a
the
was
a
legacy
from
a
departing
collector
and
he
is
immensely
proud
of
it
he
is
a
great
delight
to
me
and
says
he
will
never
cease
to
pray
for
my
welfare
talking
of
babus
one
wrote
to
royle
the
other
day
about
a
pair
of
and
said
i
have
your
measurements
but
will
be
glad
to
know
if
there
is
any
improvement
in
the
girth
do
you
think
that
was
a
very
pretty
way
of
asking
if
he
had
put
on
weight
when
i
showed
autolycus
and
the
the
photographs
i
had
taken
of
them
the
said
very
good
but
autolycus
shook
his
head
violently
and
when
boggley
asked
him
what
was
wrong
he
replied
in
an
injured
tone
that
it
made
him
look
quite
black
deep
snow
hard
frost
bright
sun
how
gloriously
sparkling
it
must
be
it
dazzles
my
eyes
to
think
of
it
i
do
wonder
you
revel
in
the
skating
and
the
long
sleigh
rides
through
the
silent
forest
talk
about
the
magic
of
the
east
it
could
never
appeal
to
me
like
the
magic
of
the
north
storks
how
the
names
thrill
one
what
was
your
hans
andersen
like
mine
was
light
blue
and
gold
with
wonderful
coloured
pictures
but
it
was
the
frontispiece
i
studied
and
which
held
me
frightened
yet
fascinated
it
was
a
picture
of
a
with
a
small
girl
in
a
blue
frock
and
white
pinafore
and
red
stockings
crying
bitterly
under
a
tree
in
the
branch
of
which
a
doll
hung
limply
thrown
there
by
cruel
brothers
through
the
trees
the
sunset
sky
was
pale
green
melting
into
and
the
wicked
little
gnomes
that
twilight
brings
were
tweaking
the
child
hair
and
jeering
at
her
misfortunes
one
felt
how
cold
it
was
and
how
badly
the
little
girl
wanted
her
hood
and
cloak
the
darkness
was
very
near
and
worse
things
than
little
gnomes
would
slip
from
behind
the
trunks
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
the
little
girl
might
have
run
home
to
warmth
and
light
and
safety
that
was
no
solution
the
doll
would
still
have
been
there
your
letter
with
its
tale
of
snow
and
great
quiet
forests
and
the
picture
you
drew
me
of
the
funny
little
girl
with
the
flaxen
plaits
and
the
red
stockings
made
me
remember
it
i
do
know
where
my
old
book
is
gone
long
since
from
the
nursery
bookshelf
to
the
dustbin
i
expect
for
it
was
and
frail
when
i
knew
and
loved
it
but
your
gave
me
the
passport
and
enabled
me
to
creep
once
again
inside
its
cover
so
brave
in
blue
and
gold
and
to
greet
my
friend
in
the
red
stockings
and
find
her
as
highly
coloured
as
ever
and
not
a
day
older
it
is
nice
of
you
to
say
i
have
a
courageous
outlook
on
life
but
i
wish
i
had
told
you
the
story
of
the
mongoose
that
was
an
otter
now
you
will
say
like
boggley
if
i
stay
much
longer
in
this
frightsome
land
my
hair
will
be
white
and
my
nervous
system
a
mere
wreck
yesterday
we
left
the
solitude
of
rika
and
went
to
polo
at
a
place
about
seventeen
miles
away
it
was
very
interesting
to
meet
all
the
neighbouring
europeans
mostly
planters
and
their
wives
there
were
about
twenty
people
and
everyone
very
nice
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
about
them
but
i
have
after
polo
which
i
enjoyed
watching
we
all
had
tea
together
and
talked
very
affably
then
royle
drove
me
home
while
boggley
went
with
royle
i
heard
as
we
were
leaving
royle
say
something
to
boggley
about
the
horse
being
young
and
skittish
and
a
faint
misgiving
passed
through
me
but
i
forgot
it
talking
to
royle
and
when
we
reached
rika
i
went
off
to
dress
for
dinner
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
others
were
just
behind
letters
were
waiting
me
and
i
lingered
so
long
over
them
i
had
to
dress
in
a
hurry
and
ran
to
the
expecting
to
find
everyone
waiting
but
the
room
was
empty
hungry
and
puzzled
i
waited
for
another
ten
minutes
and
then
went
along
to
boggley
bedroom
to
see
what
meant
anyway
but
there
was
no
one
there
more
and
more
puzzled
but
distinctly
less
hungry
i
went
back
to
the
looked
into
the
finally
wandered
out
into
the
verandah
where
i
found
the
children
old
nurse
anne
tidying
away
the
children
toys
i
said
nurse
where
everybody
anne
left
the
toys
and
lifted
both
hands
to
high
heaven
och
miss
douglas
dear
it
was
for
nothing
i
dreamt
last
night
of
the
night
before
ma
sister
maggie
man
was
killed
by
a
kick
from
a
wicked
grey
horse
angus
was
his
name
and
a
fine
young
lad
he
was
i
dreamt
i
saw
one
as
big
as
three
hills
it
was
with
an
awful
starin
white
face
and
a
tail
on
it
near
as
long
as
from
portree
to
sligachen
it
give
a
great
screech
and
a
wallop
in
the
face
of
me
and
jumped
into
the
loch
and
by
next
morning
a
thursday
it
was
ma
sister
maggie
came
into
the
door
cryin
and
och
ma
poor
man
and
him
so
kind
and
so
young
and
fell
on
the
floor
as
stiff
as
a
board
anne
comes
from
skye
and
often
tells
me
about
and
odd
denizens
of
that
far
island
and
i
find
her
soft
highland
speech
with
its
ass
for
as
and
ch
for
j
very
diverting
but
this
time
i
was
amused
but
nothing
happened
anne
what
are
you
talking
about
where
is
my
brother
mercy
on
us
all
how
can
i
tell
the
mistress
and
the
young
gentleman
has
never
come
in
and
the
master
says
to
me
me
my
flask
anne
says
he
and
fetch
it
i
did
and
he
drove
away
an
i
sure
as
i
sittin
here
i
did
see
the
for
nothing
what
does
a
flask
mean
but
an
accident
och
och
and
a
nice
young
gentleman
he
was
too
if
life
is
going
to
contain
many
such
i
do
see
how
i
am
to
get
through
it
with
any
credit
i
left
anne
whom
at
that
moment
i
hated
to
seek
information
from
the
servants
which
she
did
with
a
valiant
disregard
of
her
entire
lack
of
knowledge
of
hindustani
a
language
she
stubbornly
refused
to
learn
a
word
of
the
last
i
saw
of
her
she
had
seized
the
young
assistant
and
was
shouting
at
him
chokra
ye
impident
little
black
deevil
will
you
tell
this
moment
has
there
been
an
accident
backwards
and
forwards
i
went
in
the
verandah
then
down
the
steps
to
the
road
straining
my
eyes
to
see
and
my
ears
to
hear
something
what
i
did
not
know
from
the
garden
the
scent
of
the
roses
and
mignonette
came
to
me
in
the
soft
indian
darkness
i
ventured
a
little
bit
along
the
road
too
anxious
to
remember
or
remembering
to
care
that
i
had
no
lantern
and
that
at
any
moment
i
might
tread
on
a
snake
i
could
only
think
of
one
thing
and
how
often
i
pictured
it
royle
coming
back
and
the
natives
carrying
someone
someone
who
did
laugh
any
more
the
odd
thing
was
i
did
seem
to
mind
at
all
what
happened
to
kind
royle
it
was
boggley
and
only
boggley
that
mattered
to
me
of
course
nothing
did
happen
to
anyone
it
is
when
one
expects
and
dreads
it
that
tragedy
comes
tragedy
comes
quietly
swiftly
i
remember
going
to
see
a
fisherman
widow
in
a
little
village
on
the
stormy
east
coast
she
told
me
of
her
husband
death
i
had
his
tea
a
ready
an
a
bit
buttered
toast
an
a
kipper
but
he
never
cam
in
that
was
all
he
never
cam
in
when
our
wanderers
returned
they
were
rather
amused
than
otherwise
the
horse
had
given
trouble
and
ended
by
kicking
the
trap
to
pieces
and
they
had
to
walk
part
of
the
way
home
quite
simple
you
see
but
the
first
opportunity
i
looked
in
a
mirror
to
see
if
my
hair
had
not
turned
white
in
a
single
night
as
men
have
done
through
sudden
fear
it
had
but
i
did
dream
of
a
with
an
awful
starin
white
face
this
morning
royle
took
me
to
the
village
to
get
some
brass
to
take
home
the
shop
was
a
little
hut
with
an
earthen
floor
a
pair
of
scales
and
one
shelf
crowded
with
brass
things
made
not
for
the
european
market
but
for
the
daily
use
of
the
people
such
as
is
the
pretty
name
and
big
brass
plates
out
of
which
they
eat
their
rice
and
they
keep
them
beautifully
polished
with
sand
and
i
think
they
ought
to
be
rather
decorative
much
more
attractive
certainly
than
the
candlesticks
and
pots
and
cheap
rough
which
is
the
usual
loot
carried
away
by
the
visitor
another
will
soon
be
upon
us
they
simply
pounce
on
one
we
have
to
get
letters
away
by
tuesday
from
the
mofussil
instead
of
thursday
as
in
calcutta
i
look
forward
with
great
distaste
to
leaving
this
place
next
week
when
with
the
royles
one
ca
imagine
oneself
happy
anywhere
else
the
days
pass
so
quickly
breakfast
seems
hardly
over
when
it
is
time
for
luncheon
and
before
one
has
really
settled
down
to
read
or
write
it
is
four
and
time
to
go
to
tea
which
is
spread
down
by
the
lake
among
the
roses
the
sun
having
lost
its
fierceness
and
begun
to
think
of
going
to
bed
we
all
sit
at
a
round
table
and
eat
brown
bread
and
butter
and
jam
all
the
china
we
use
is
very
pretty
and
came
from
ireland
but
royle
has
been
greatly
troubled
by
its
discoloured
appearance
which
the
servants
assured
her
there
was
no
cure
for
i
suggested
rough
salt
and
and
after
tea
yesterday
afternoon
they
brought
it
and
we
each
set
to
work
on
our
own
cup
and
saucer
and
behold
in
a
very
short
time
they
were
like
new
boggley
made
his
particularly
beautiful
but
unfortunately
broke
it
immediately
afterwards
at
which
kittiwake
laughed
so
immoderately
she
fell
on
her
saucer
and
sent
it
to
its
long
home
i
have
learned
to
take
a
most
intelligent
interest
in
fowls
and
nietzsche
and
more
and
more
as
the
days
pass
do
i
like
and
admire
our
host
and
hostess
i
never
met
people
i
felt
so
towards
here
come
the
children
flying
followed
patiently
by
the
old
with
a
spoon
in
one
hand
and
a
bottle
of
emulsion
in
the
other
i
had
better
finish
this
letter
and
get
the
ink
out
of
their
reach
thursday
now
we
are
really
camping
out
and
i
sit
outside
my
tent
even
as
abraham
did
of
old
i
have
a
whole
long
day
before
me
to
write
boggley
was
up
and
away
long
before
i
was
awake
and
wo
be
back
till
evening
we
left
rika
on
monday
afternoon
very
sad
indeed
royle
as
is
her
way
heaped
us
with
benefits
and
mindful
of
our
starvation
on
the
way
to
rika
had
a
packed
with
cold
fowl
bread
tomatoes
and
a
big
cake
as
we
drove
off
the
children
pursued
us
down
the
drive
crying
do
go
away
stay
with
us
always
at
the
station
we
were
told
that
the
train
was
two
hours
late
and
boggley
thought
it
would
be
an
excellent
plan
to
spend
the
time
calling
on
the
blackies
who
live
near
so
leaving
autolycus
and
the
with
the
luggage
we
set
out
we
had
been
shown
the
and
a
crocodile
that
blackie
had
shot
and
were
about
to
drink
a
dish
of
tea
in
the
when
we
heard
the
whistle
of
an
engine
the
train
cried
boggley
bounding
to
his
feet
and
spurning
the
cup
of
tea
blackie
was
offering
to
him
it
was
no
moment
for
ceremony
with
a
shrieked
we
leapt
out
of
the
window
and
across
the
compound
and
set
off
on
our
run
to
the
station
there
is
something
peculiarly
nasty
about
the
nature
of
indian
trains
simply
because
we
left
the
station
it
chose
to
be
up
to
time
it
must
have
been
an
amusing
incident
to
the
people
in
the
station
but
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
had
i
been
one
of
the
natives
watching
from
a
carriage
instead
of
so
to
speak
one
of
the
principal
actors
there
was
the
engine
shrieking
in
its
anxiety
to
start
there
was
our
luggage
neatly
spread
all
over
an
empty
compartment
there
was
autolycus
protesting
shrilly
that
the
train
could
not
leave
without
his
sahib
who
was
a
very
sahib
and
finally
there
were
with
scarlet
faces
topis
on
the
backs
of
our
heads
surrounded
by
a
thick
cloud
of
dust
careering
wildly
into
the
station
after
all
the
fuss
we
had
only
about
thirty
miles
to
travel
when
we
got
out
and
drove
three
miles
in
a
kind
of
native
cart
to
a
a
very
poor
and
uncomfortable
specimen
of
its
kind
it
did
uplift
us
to
hear
that
plague
was
very
bad
all
round
and
after
a
somewhat
jungly
dinner
during
which
we
were
very
thoughtful
and
disinclined
for
conversation
we
sought
our
mildewed
couches
to
rise
again
at
skreich
of
day
and
continue
our
journey
till
late
on
tuesday
night
we
got
out
finally
at
baratah
station
and
drove
out
to
our
present
the
people
knew
we
were
coming
and
the
tents
were
up
but
they
had
expected
us
till
the
next
day
so
nothing
was
ready
not
even
a
lamp
it
was
the
oddest
experience
to
stumble
about
in
black
darkness
in
entirely
unknown
surroundings
you
know
how
boggley
tumbles
over
things
in
the
broad
light
of
day
so
you
can
imagine
what
tosses
he
took
over
and
chairs
in
the
darkness
it
did
last
long
however
for
an
important
fat
hurried
in
shocked
at
our
plight
and
explaining
that
his
sahib
lister
was
away
for
a
few
days
brought
us
a
lamp
and
other
necessaries
dinner
was
not
possible
under
the
circumstances
the
box
with
our
forks
and
knives
had
not
arrived
so
the
remains
of
royle
coldly
furnished
forth
our
evening
meal
while
we
sat
there
uncomfortably
poised
on
gnawing
legs
of
fowl
and
hunches
of
bread
i
thought
of
you
probably
dining
at
the
ritz
or
the
savoy
with
soft
lights
and
music
and
lovely
food
and
probably
not
half
as
merry
as
boggley
and
i
do
know
if
i
really
like
a
tent
to
live
in
the
floor
is
covered
with
straw
and
then
a
carpet
is
stretched
over
it
which
makes
a
particularly
bulgy
uneven
surface
to
stand
and
things
on
the
straw
too
is
apt
to
stick
out
where
it
is
least
expected
and
gives
one
rather
the
feeling
of
being
a
tinker
sleeping
in
a
barn
at
night
a
tent
is
an
awesome
place
it
is
terrible
to
have
no
door
to
lock
and
to
be
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
anything
that
creeps
and
crawls
to
have
only
a
between
you
and
an
awful
end
i
woke
last
night
to
hear
something
sniffing
outside
the
tent
it
scraped
and
scraped
and
i
was
sure
that
it
was
digging
a
hole
and
creeping
underneath
the
canvas
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
in
a
quavering
voice
said
go
away
and
the
noise
stopped
but
only
to
begin
again
scrape
scrape
snuffle
snuffle
in
the
most
eerie
way
then
something
worse
happened
at
my
very
ear
as
it
seemed
the
most
yell
rent
the
astonished
air
it
was
only
a
jackal
boggley
says
but
it
sounded
as
if
all
the
forces
of
evil
had
been
let
loose
at
once
you
can
laugh
if
you
like
but
i
think
it
was
enough
to
frighten
a
very
daniel
as
for
me
in
one
moment
i
was
well
under
the
blankets
with
fingers
in
both
ears
and
i
suppose
even
in
the
midst
of
my
terror
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
the
next
thing
i
knew
was
daylight
and
the
cheerful
sound
of
voices
i
shall
have
a
lamp
burning
and
a
watchman
to
sleep
outside
my
tent
baratah
is
quite
a
large
town
and
has
a
roman
catholic
mission
and
two
lady
doctors
we
are
camping
about
a
mile
from
the
town
in
a
corner
of
lister
compound
it
is
pretty
with
grass
and
and
opposite
is
the
guest
house
of
the
raj
where
we
would
be
staying
now
were
it
not
that
its
roof
is
not
quite
safe
and
it
can
not
be
used
i
went
through
it
and
a
great
neglected
place
it
is
with
tawdry
early
victorian
furniture
and
awful
oleographs
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
yesterday
we
went
for
a
walk
to
explore
along
an
avenue
of
peepul
trees
across
a
fine
and
then
we
lighted
on
a
big
tank
a
tiny
native
boy
was
perched
on
the
bank
watching
something
in
the
water
so
we
sat
down
beside
him
and
watched
too
the
something
was
very
large
and
black
and
we
were
puzzled
to
know
what
it
was
till
at
a
word
from
the
child
it
heaved
itself
out
of
the
water
and
revealed
itself
an
elephant
up
it
came
to
where
we
were
laid
its
trunk
down
so
that
the
small
boy
could
walk
up
and
off
he
went
proudly
riding
on
its
head
it
was
the
nicest
thing
to
watch
i
ever
saw
we
got
the
home
mail
the
night
we
arrived
here
but
could
see
to
read
it
till
the
next
morning
so
you
are
back
in
london
sloppy
muggy
february
london
how
you
will
miss
the
cold
clear
north
and
all
the
but
you
will
be
so
busy
finishing
the
book
that
surroundings
wo
matter
much
it
seemed
quite
to
see
the
familiar
address
on
the
i
am
going
to
devote
entirely
to
writing
surely
my
book
will
make
some
progress
now
how
many
words
should
there
be
in
a
book
got
now
ragged
incompetent
words
they
are
too
i
wonder
what
makes
a
writer
of
books
would
knowing
all
the
words
in
the
dictionary
help
me
my
statements
are
so
bald
somehow
it
seem
an
interesting
tale
to
me
so
i
afraid
i
ca
expect
an
unprejudiced
reader
to
find
it
thrilling
the
mutiny
is
perhaps
too
large
a
subject
for
me
though
mind
you
there
is
one
bit
that
sounds
rather
well
i
have
taken
great
pains
with
it
and
as
viola
said
of
her
declaration
is
poetical
the
worst
of
it
is
when
i
write
poetically
i
am
never
quite
sure
that
i
am
writing
sense
i
dare
say
i
would
be
wise
to
take
the
moorwife
advice
you
remember
in
wisps
are
in
when
the
man
had
listened
to
the
moorwife
tale
he
said
i
might
write
a
book
about
that
a
novel
in
twelve
volumes
or
better
a
popular
play
or
better
still
said
the
moorwife
you
might
let
it
alone
ah
said
the
man
that
would
be
pleasanter
and
easier
how
true
thursday
we
are
still
in
baratah
as
you
see
and
shall
be
till
tuesday
it
is
a
very
nice
life
this
nomadic
existence
and
one
gets
nearer
the
people
they
come
in
little
groups
and
talk
to
boggley
outside
his
tent
and
i
must
say
he
is
most
patient
with
them
and
tries
to
do
his
very
best
for
each
one
of
them
they
make
my
heart
ache
these
natives
they
are
so
gentle
and
so
desperately
poor
is
it
steevens
who
says
the
indian
ryot
has
been
starving
for
thirty
centuries
and
sees
no
reason
why
he
should
be
filled
the
listers
are
home
now
and
we
have
been
seeing
a
lot
of
them
they
are
delightful
people
lister
is
quite
a
girl
and
so
and
cheery
she
has
the
prettiest
house
i
think
i
ever
saw
when
we
went
to
call
the
first
time
and
were
shown
into
the
with
its
great
open
fireplace
and
cupboards
of
blue
china
i
suppose
it
was
the
contrast
with
our
own
rather
sordid
surroundings
but
it
seemed
to
me
like
fairyland
the
hall
is
lovely
with
a
gallery
all
round
and
most
exquisite
carving
velvet
curtains
persian
rugs
glowing
with
rich
soft
colours
and
everywhere
great
silver
bowls
of
flowers
they
are
the
most
hospitable
people
and
ask
us
to
dinner
every
night
and
to
every
other
meal
as
well
lister
told
me
babu
stories
last
night
here
is
one
the
government
sent
round
making
inquiries
about
some
scandinavians
please
do
ask
why
scandinavians
because
i
answer
the
officer
forwarded
the
reference
to
the
different
for
report
the
babus
in
charge
of
these
stations
had
an
idea
what
scandinavians
were
but
would
have
scorned
to
ask
three
of
the
reports
ran
thus
honoured
sir
i
have
the
honour
to
report
that
the
scandinavian
has
been
concluded
in
this
district
and
has
been
removed
to
lahserai
survey
and
settlement
operations
sir
i
have
the
honour
to
report
that
there
has
been
no
scandinavians
in
the
district
this
year
but
it
is
raging
furiously
at
rika
plague
sir
i
have
the
honour
to
report
two
scandinavians
were
seen
at
gopalbung
one
was
shot
by
billie
burke
sahib
the
other
has
not
since
returned
tigers
that
is
a
good
but
somewhat
involved
story
another
was
about
a
missionary
who
had
been
eaten
by
a
tiger
the
police
wired
a
tiger
has
the
pope
of
ramnugger
yesterday
the
listers
had
a
about
twenty
men
came
from
all
round
and
lister
and
i
went
with
them
we
drove
two
and
two
to
a
very
large
lake
and
then
set
sail
in
queer
native
boats
punted
by
natives
of
course
i
wanted
to
go
with
boggley
but
was
sent
off
with
a
strange
man
one
major
griffiths
who
eyed
me
with
great
dislike
because
he
said
my
light
dress
would
frighten
the
birds
it
got
frightfully
hot
with
the
sun
beating
on
the
water
and
i
simply
dared
not
put
up
a
sunshade
in
case
of
scaring
the
birds
more
than
i
was
already
doing
and
thereby
increasing
the
wrath
of
my
companion
he
shot
a
lot
of
ducks
but
evidently
not
so
many
as
he
thought
he
ought
to
shoot
and
when
he
saw
the
birds
all
congregated
at
one
corner
of
the
lake
a
thought
struck
him
and
he
told
the
natives
to
take
us
to
shore
he
got
out
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
which
i
obediently
did
and
together
we
crawled
through
the
jungle
with
the
chattering
above
us
and
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
snakes
hissing
beneath
our
feet
if
i
stepped
which
i
could
hardly
avoid
doing
sometimes
on
a
fallen
branch
making
it
crackle
the
man
turned
on
me
a
glance
so
malignant
i
positively
quailed
breathlessly
we
crept
to
the
and
the
unsuspecting
ducks
and
then
major
griffiths
fired
into
the
brown
is
that
the
proper
expression
killing
i
do
know
how
many
i
do
think
it
was
at
all
a
nice
thing
to
do
but
my
opinion
was
neither
asked
nor
desired
even
then
my
friend
was
not
satisfied
and
he
voyaged
about
until
i
knew
luncheon
was
long
since
a
thing
of
the
past
and
i
hated
so
the
shape
of
his
face
i
could
have
screamed
when
at
last
we
did
return
i
found
my
surmise
as
to
luncheon
had
been
only
too
correct
and
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
scraps
the
next
i
attend
i
shall
choose
as
companion
a
less
earnest
sportsman
the
weather
is
beginning
to
as
boggley
calls
it
and
during
the
day
the
tent
is
insufferable
i
can
sit
outside
it
in
the
early
morning
but
as
the
sun
gets
up
autolycus
summons
the
and
they
carry
my
table
and
to
the
verandah
of
the
guest
house
which
has
a
cool
not
to
say
clammy
and
atmosphere
my
chief
trials
are
the
insects
there
is
a
land
of
large
black
beetle
with
wings
that
has
a
strange
habit
of
poising
itself
just
above
my
head
and
remaining
there
someone
told
me
who
i
forget
anyway
boggley
says
it
is
true
but
it
seems
quite
likely
that
if
these
beetles
drop
on
you
they
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
quite
so
horrible
i
keep
a
wary
eye
on
them
and
shift
my
seat
at
their
approach
not
a
hundred
yards
away
a
heathen
temple
stands
with
its
gilded
roof
shining
in
the
sun
we
tried
to
go
inside
it
the
other
day
but
an
angel
with
a
flaming
sword
in
the
shape
of
a
kept
us
out
it
did
look
very
attractive
we
saw
enough
when
we
beheld
the
post
the
poor
kids
and
goats
are
tied
to
all
messy
and
horrid
from
the
last
sacrifice
the
priest
who
forbade
us
to
enter
just
to
show
there
was
no
hung
wreaths
of
marigolds
round
our
necks
boggley
once
we
were
out
of
sight
hid
his
in
the
ditch
but
i
afraid
they
might
find
out
and
be
offended
went
about
for
the
rest
of
the
day
decked
like
any
sacrificial
goat
that
we
are
leading
the
simple
life
i
think
you
would
admit
if
you
saw
us
at
our
meals
i
find
that
food
really
matters
very
little
our
cook
is
of
the
jungle
jungly
autolycus
is
disgusted
with
him
and
does
his
best
to
reform
him
i
have
alone
as
boggley
is
away
inspecting
before
seven
i
emerge
from
my
tent
and
find
a
table
before
boggley
tent
with
a
cloth
on
it
not
particularly
clean
a
loaf
of
bread
our
bread
is
made
in
jail
a
goes
to
fetch
it
every
second
day
a
tin
of
butter
and
a
tin
of
jam
autolycus
appears
accompanied
by
the
jungly
cook
bearing
a
plate
of
what
under
happier
circumstances
might
have
been
porridge
a
spoonful
or
two
is
more
than
enough
no
good
demands
autolycus
no
and
disdainfully
handing
the
plate
back
to
the
entirely
indifferent
cook
he
proceeds
to
produce
from
somewhere
about
his
person
a
teapot
and
two
tiny
eggs
luncheon
is
much
worse
for
the
food
that
appears
is
so
incalculably
greasy
that
it
argues
a
more
than
bowing
acquaintance
with
native
dinner
is
luncheon
intensified
so
tea
is
really
the
only
thing
we
can
enjoy
the
fact
is
if
we
thought
about
it
we
would
never
eat
at
all
i
happened
to
walk
round
the
tent
and
found
the
washing
our
dishes
in
water
that
was
positively
thick
and
drying
them
with
a
cloth
that
had
begun
life
polishing
our
brown
boots
i
stormed
at
him
in
english
and
later
boggley
stormed
at
him
in
hindustani
and
he
vowed
it
would
never
happen
again
but
i
dare
say
if
i
were
to
look
round
at
this
minute
i
should
find
him
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
and
i
do
really
care
so
long
as
neither
of
us
perishes
with
cholera
as
a
result
such
funny
things
live
behind
my
tent
what
should
i
find
the
other
day
but
a
little
native
baby
about
two
or
three
years
old
it
seems
his
mother
is
dead
and
his
father
who
is
our
has
to
take
him
with
him
wherever
he
goes
he
is
the
oddest
little
figure
clothed
in
a
most
inadequate
shirt
and
a
string
round
his
neck
with
a
shell
attached
to
keep
away
evil
spirits
his
hair
is
closely
shaved
except
for
one
upstanding
tuft
which
is
left
to
pull
him
up
to
heaven
with
and
his
face
looks
nothing
but
two
great
twinkling
eyes
he
squats
beside
me
nearly
all
day
and
eagerly
eats
anything
i
give
him
like
a
little
puppy
dog
toffee
and
fancy
biscuits
both
of
which
i
possess
in
abundance
are
his
favourites
an
old
servant
of
boggley
is
with
a
sahib
near
here
and
he
arrived
dressed
in
spotless
white
from
head
to
foot
bearing
in
one
hand
a
large
seed
cake
wreathed
with
marigolds
and
in
the
other
a
plate
of
toffee
coloured
pink
green
and
yellow
an
offering
to
the
miss
sahib
which
he
presented
with
many
salaams
and
of
which
my
little
hindoo
gets
the
benefit
autolycus
and
the
take
a
great
interest
in
teaching
him
manners
when
i
hold
out
a
biscuit
autolycus
says
sternly
say
salaam
to
the
miss
sahib
and
the
baby
puts
his
small
hand
gravely
to
his
forehead
bowing
low
with
a
talaam
mees
tahib
then
snaps
up
the
prize
i
shall
miss
my
little
companion
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
him
little
brown
heir
of
the
ages
already
he
can
lisp
to
idols
but
he
has
never
even
heard
of
the
christ
who
said
suffer
the
children
i
shall
finish
this
and
post
it
before
we
leave
we
have
been
to
church
the
most
unusual
occurrence
with
us
nowadays
of
course
it
was
only
an
english
church
i
remember
the
time
when
i
thought
it
very
exciting
and
more
than
a
little
wicked
to
be
present
at
a
church
of
england
service
and
the
padre
was
a
very
little
young
padre
and
rather
depressing
he
insisted
so
that
we
were
but
a
passing
vapour
that
i
began
to
feel
it
was
only
too
horribly
true
and
boggley
who
had
partaken
largely
of
tinned
cheese
at
luncheon
and
was
feeling
far
from
well
grew
every
moment
more
yellow
and
green
the
listers
asked
us
to
go
back
with
them
to
dinner
but
we
thought
it
better
boggley
especially
to
seek
the
seclusion
of
our
tents
march
now
we
are
in
a
different
place
at
least
it
has
a
different
name
and
is
a
day
journey
from
bantale
but
it
looks
exactly
the
same
we
left
baratah
yesterday
morning
and
got
in
and
out
of
trains
all
day
until
about
seven
in
the
evening
we
got
out
finally
at
manpur
i
had
a
dreadful
cold
and
was
sniffy
and
inclined
to
be
cross
so
when
boggley
suggested
we
should
dine
in
the
while
autolycus
and
the
went
on
with
the
luggage
to
acquaint
the
people
of
our
arrival
i
upbraided
him
for
not
making
proper
arrangements
and
reviled
the
meagre
repast
and
was
altogether
very
unpleasant
when
we
reached
our
destination
we
found
autolycus
prancing
distractedly
this
he
said
to
boggley
is
what
comes
of
making
no
bundabust
some
other
people
were
already
occupying
the
bungalow
and
we
could
only
get
the
back
rooms
small
mouldy
and
inconvenient
poor
boggley
looked
so
crushed
i
had
to
laugh
and
we
calmed
the
worried
autolycus
who
hates
to
see
his
sahib
shoved
into
corners
and
there
being
no
inducement
to
remain
up
went
to
bed
manpur
is
a
fairly
big
station
the
sort
of
place
you
read
about
in
novels
there
are
six
households
and
a
club
boggley
and
i
called
on
all
the
six
this
evening
and
then
went
to
the
club
everyone
meets
there
in
the
evening
to
see
the
and
to
play
tennis
and
bridge
it
is
rather
a
bored
little
community
manpur
i
think
they
are
all
pretty
sick
of
each
other
and
one
ca
wonder
even
an
archangel
would
pall
if
one
met
him
at
tea
played
tennis
with
him
and
sat
next
him
at
dinner
almost
every
day
of
the
year
how
much
more
poor
human
beings
and
human
beings
at
that
taken
separately
they
are
delightful
but
each
assures
us
that
the
others
are
quite
impossible
they
unite
in
being
shocked
at
our
living
in
such
discomfort
and
have
all
invited
us
to
stay
but
it
is
worth
while
to
change
our
quarters
besides
we
are
going
away
for
the
to
some
friend
of
boggley
who
lives
about
thirty
miles
from
here
a
nice
little
young
civilian
is
at
present
calling
on
us
he
came
to
pay
his
duty
call
and
he
and
boggley
became
so
deep
in
oxford
talk
and
found
so
many
mutual
friends
that
we
asked
him
to
stay
to
dinner
autolycus
told
me
in
a
stage
whisper
that
the
sahib
could
easily
stay
as
the
cook
was
very
good
and
that
we
would
get
quite
a
calcutta
dinner
his
pride
as
he
bore
in
the
dishes
was
beautiful
to
see
and
it
was
a
good
dinner
though
rather
tinny
thursday
this
delayed
letter
must
be
posted
before
we
leave
by
the
night
train
for
our
next
trek
we
came
back
late
last
night
from
misanpore
after
a
nice
but
very
queer
time
on
saturday
when
after
a
long
dusty
drive
of
eight
miles
from
the
station
we
arrived
at
the
bungalow
of
boggley
friend
there
was
every
evidence
that
no
visitors
were
expected
just
think
boggley
had
never
let
him
know
we
were
coming
the
poor
man
was
ignorant
of
the
fearful
joy
in
store
for
him
i
gripped
boggley
by
the
arm
wretch
i
hissed
in
his
ear
why
did
you
write
what
sort
of
man
is
he
will
he
hate
having
me
bellowed
boggley
to
the
bungalow
then
turning
to
me
oh
yes
he
hate
it
he
said
calmly
but
he
be
pleased
afterwards
i
could
have
shaken
him
making
me
play
the
part
of
a
visit
to
the
dentist
when
our
host
appeared
very
dishevelled
it
turned
out
that
he
was
feeling
far
from
well
and
had
been
lying
down
and
beheld
me
dismay
was
written
large
on
his
countenance
he
glared
round
in
a
hunted
way
and
it
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
make
a
bolt
for
it
but
he
remembered
in
time
his
manhood
and
faced
me
his
name
is
ferris
and
he
is
tall
and
bald
and
about
forty
and
so
shy
that
when
he
blushes
his
eyes
water
somehow
we
all
got
inside
the
house
and
boggley
and
i
sat
in
the
while
ferris
rushed
out
to
summon
his
minions
and
make
arrangements
we
heard
a
whispered
discussion
going
on
about
sheets
and
i
longed
to
tell
my
distracted
host
that
i
had
all
my
bedding
with
me
in
a
strap
but
the
thought
that
he
might
consider
me
ondelicate
like
glegg
deterred
me
presently
i
was
shown
into
what
only
too
evidently
was
our
host
own
room
for
a
servant
snatched
away
some
last
remaining
effects
of
his
master
a
and
a
slipper
as
i
entered
i
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
pondered
over
what
i
would
have
felt
had
i
been
a
man
and
shy
and
seedy
and
a
strange
female
had
been
suddenly
shot
into
my
peaceful
home
it
was
rather
a
difficult
i
have
met
men
who
were
difficult
to
talk
to
but
never
one
like
ferris
who
while
willing
indeed
anxious
to
be
agreeable
so
absolutely
annihilated
conversation
it
was
till
dinner
on
sunday
night
that
i
discovered
a
subject
that
really
interested
him
london
restaurants
he
grew
quite
animated
as
we
discussed
the
relative
merits
of
the
ritz
the
carlton
the
savoy
the
dieudonn√©
i
think
that
long
thin
bald
gentle
bachelor
spends
all
his
spare
moments
and
he
must
have
many
in
lonely
misanpore
thinking
about
his
next
leave
and
the
feasts
he
will
then
enjoy
yet
the
odd
thing
is
he
is
greedy
about
food
i
think
it
must
be
more
the
lights
and
music
and
people
that
attract
him
ferris
and
boggley
were
away
all
sunday
and
i
spent
the
whole
day
with
a
volume
of
dana
gibson
drawings
the
only
book
i
could
find
i
did
go
for
a
short
walk
but
the
dust
was
nearly
and
except
the
little
bungalow
and
outhouses
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
see
yesterday
again
boggley
had
to
go
and
inspect
some
place
so
it
was
decided
he
would
bicycle
there
and
then
pick
me
up
at
some
station
we
had
to
change
at
on
our
way
to
manpur
i
drove
to
the
station
in
ferris
little
dogcart
alone
ferris
said
he
was
so
sorry
he
had
an
engagement
but
i
think
myself
it
was
simply
that
he
could
face
the
eight
miles
alone
with
me
the
groom
instead
of
sitting
behind
ran
behind
and
as
the
pony
was
fresh
he
had
to
run
pretty
fast
there
were
two
roads
a
or
made
road
and
a
road
on
which
the
natives
walked
and
drove
their
autolycus
and
the
were
waiting
at
the
station
and
put
me
into
a
carriage
they
went
straight
on
to
manpur
with
the
luggage
instead
of
waiting
at
the
station
where
we
changed
trains
it
was
ten
when
i
got
out
of
the
train
and
boggley
had
said
he
would
be
no
later
than
eleven
then
we
would
have
luncheon
and
get
the
one
train
to
manpur
i
went
into
the
to
ask
what
we
could
have
for
luncheon
ham
and
eggs
said
the
fat
babu
promptly
nothing
else
i
asked
yes
said
the
babu
mixed
biscuits
oh
i
said
surprised
certainlee
said
the
babu
then
i
went
outside
to
read
a
book
and
watch
for
boggley
my
book
was
one
of
those
american
novels
where
every
woman
is
to
judge
from
the
illustrations
of
more
than
earthly
beauty
i
got
so
disheartened
after
a
little
when
everyone
i
met
had
a
complexion
of
rose
and
snow
besides
i
did
believe
it
that
i
shut
it
up
i
found
it
was
nearly
twelve
and
boggley
had
arrived
i
waited
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
went
in
and
ate
some
ham
and
eggs
one
and
the
train
came
and
went
but
still
no
trace
of
the
laggard
outside
the
station
the
blinding
white
road
lay
empty
nothing
stirred
not
even
a
native
was
visible
the
whole
world
seemed
asleep
in
the
heat
a
pile
of
trunks
lay
on
the
platform
addressed
to
somewhere
in
devonshire
and
labelled
wanted
on
the
some
happy
people
were
going
home
a
far
cry
it
seemed
from
this
dusty
land
to
green
devonshire
i
sat
on
the
largest
trunk
and
thought
about
it
two
three
four
the
hours
went
past
i
felt
myself
becoming
exactly
like
a
native
sitting
with
my
hands
folded
looking
straight
before
me
if
i
had
been
so
anxious
i
should
have
minded
the
waiting
at
all
now
and
again
i
refreshed
myself
with
a
peep
at
the
babu
just
to
assure
myself
that
i
was
the
only
person
left
alive
in
the
world
about
five
boggley
and
his
bicycle
strolled
into
the
station
i
had
meant
to
be
frightfully
cross
with
him
when
he
appeared
that
is
to
say
if
he
were
wounded
or
disabled
in
any
way
but
somehow
i
never
can
be
very
cross
when
i
see
him
the
way
he
wrinkles
up
his
eyes
is
so
disarming
he
had
absolutely
no
excuse
except
that
he
had
run
across
old
friends
and
they
had
persuaded
him
to
stay
to
lunch
and
then
they
had
got
talking
and
so
on
and
so
on
he
was
very
repentant
but
inclined
to
laugh
i
expect
really
he
had
forgotten
for
the
time
he
had
a
sister
he
confessed
he
had
mentioned
my
existence
till
he
was
leaving
and
then
he
said
they
did
seem
rather
surprised
i
should
think
so
indeed
our
home
mail
was
waiting
us
at
manpur
and
another
calcutta
dinner
your
letter
my
faithful
friend
was
more
than
usually
charming
and
kind
a
balm
to
my
lacerated
feelings
if
you
do
get
a
letter
next
mail
after
this
it
will
mean
either
that
we
are
entirely
out
of
the
reach
of
post
offices
or
that
a
tiger
has
eaten
the
haganpore
march
a
whole
fortnight
since
i
wrote
last
and
our
tour
is
almost
over
on
wednesday
we
go
back
to
calcutta
and
in
april
i
sail
for
home
the
time
has
simply
rushed
past
this
last
fortnight
has
been
a
time
of
pure
delight
i
have
been
too
absorbed
in
enjoying
myself
to
write
first
we
stayed
two
days
in
a
town
where
boggley
had
to
open
some
sort
of
building
the
natives
met
us
with
a
band
and
there
were
decorations
and
mottoes
and
crowds
in
the
evening
a
dramatic
entertainment
took
place
for
our
amusement
acted
by
schoolboys
mark
anthony
wore
a
a
norfolk
jacket
and
a
bowler
hat
in
the
middle
of
friends
romans
countrymen
the
bowler
fell
off
still
declaiming
he
picked
it
up
with
his
toes
caught
it
with
his
hand
and
gravely
put
it
on
again
very
much
on
one
side
i
envied
the
mob
their
serene
calm
of
countenance
boggley
and
i
made
horrible
faces
in
our
efforts
to
preserve
our
gravity
the
next
day
boggley
played
in
a
football
match
with
these
same
boys
one
got
a
kick
on
the
shin
and
limping
up
to
boggley
said
sir
i
am
wounded
i
can
not
play
whereupon
another
ran
up
to
the
wounded
one
crying
courage
brother
tis
a
nelson
death
great
dears
i
thought
they
were
since
then
we
have
been
through
dry
places
and
camped
in
desolate
places
hardly
ever
seeing
a
european
and
enjoying
ourselves
extremely
one
day
a
day
boggley
shot
two
crocodiles
one
was
a
but
the
other
was
a
great
old
most
loathsome
to
look
at
autolycus
hoped
for
inside
it
and
i
believe
they
did
actually
find
relics
of
his
gruesome
meals
in
the
shape
of
anklets
and
rings
and
bangles
boggley
is
going
to
have
the
skins
made
up
into
things
for
me
but
it
will
take
about
six
months
to
cure
them
it
is
good
to
think
there
is
one
the
less
i
hate
the
nasty
treacherous
beasts
pretending
they
are
logs
and
then
eating
the
poor
natives
one
night
we
had
a
delightful
on
the
edge
of
a
lochan
well
stocked
with
duck
which
boggley
set
out
to
shoot
and
ended
by
missing
gloriously
we
were
much
embarrassed
by
a
fat
old
landowner
heaping
presents
on
us
he
nearly
wept
when
we
refused
to
accept
a
goat
all
the
fortnight
we
have
only
met
two
europeans
a
couple
called
martin
i
do
know
quite
what
they
were
or
why
they
were
holding
up
the
flag
of
empire
in
this
lonely
outpost
but
they
were
the
greyest
people
i
ever
saw
finding
ourselves
in
the
neighbourhood
of
europeans
we
called
as
in
duty
bound
the
compound
round
the
bungalow
had
a
dreary
look
and
when
we
were
shown
into
the
i
could
see
at
a
glance
it
was
a
room
that
no
one
took
any
interest
in
the
rugs
on
the
floor
were
rumpled
the
cushions
soiled
photographs
stood
about
in
broken
frames
and
the
flowers
were
dying
in
their
glasses
when
martin
came
in
i
was
surprised
at
her
room
a
long
grey
face
eyes
greyish
hair
rolled
up
anyhow
and
greyish
clothes
with
a
hiatus
between
the
bodice
and
skirt
this
said
i
to
myself
is
a
woman
who
has
lost
interest
in
herself
and
her
surroundings
her
husband
was
small
and
and
given
encouragement
inclined
to
be
jokesome
sometimes
by
accident
he
was
funny
martin
paid
very
little
attention
to
us
and
none
whatever
to
her
husband
jokes
i
laughed
loudly
i
thought
it
was
so
persevering
of
him
to
go
on
trying
to
be
funny
when
he
was
married
to
such
a
depressing
woman
as
we
got
up
to
go
i
noticed
in
a
corner
a
child
chair
with
a
little
chintz
cover
and
seated
in
it
a
smiling
china
doll
lacking
one
arm
and
a
leg
i
could
hardly
wait
till
i
was
outside
to
tell
boggley
what
i
thought
of
martin
and
her
house
the
hopeless
untidy
creature
i
raved
she
does
deserve
to
have
such
a
little
cheery
husband
or
children
the
only
thing
i
do
like
about
boggley
is
that
he
never
will
help
me
to
abuse
people
poor
woman
he
said
she
pretty
bad
then
he
told
me
her
story
as
he
had
heard
it
ten
years
ago
it
seems
she
was
quite
a
cheery
managing
woman
with
two
little
girls
whom
she
worshipped
she
and
her
husband
lived
for
the
children
they
were
just
going
to
take
them
home
when
they
sickened
with
some
ailment
martin
at
the
time
was
prostrate
after
a
bad
attack
of
fever
there
was
no
doctor
within
thirty
miles
one
child
died
and
the
mother
started
with
the
other
on
the
long
drive
to
the
nearest
doctor
the
last
ten
miles
it
was
a
dead
child
she
held
in
her
arms
when
boggley
finished
i
was
silent
remembering
the
little
chair
empty
but
for
a
broken
doll
now
that
i
have
tasted
the
joys
of
solitude
i
do
see
how
i
am
to
enjoy
living
in
a
crowd
again
i
am
practically
alone
all
day
for
boggley
has
long
distances
to
ride
and
bicycle
and
i
never
was
so
happy
in
my
life
i
write
and
i
read
and
i
fold
my
hands
in
newly
acquired
oriental
calm
which
my
bustling
busy
little
mother
most
certainly
wo
admire
and
sit
looking
before
me
for
hours
the
books
lent
me
by
various
people
are
all
read
long
ago
and
i
have
gone
back
to
those
that
are
always
with
me
they
are
all
before
me
as
i
write
the
little
fat
green
one
at
the
end
of
the
row
is
lamb
of
he
so
well
fits
some
moods
and
certain
minutes
of
the
day
that
gentle
writer
next
is
my
the
one
i
have
had
since
my
tenth
birthday
father
gave
each
of
us
a
copy
when
we
reached
the
mature
age
of
ten
it
was
only
on
high
days
and
that
we
were
allowed
to
look
at
his
own
treasured
copy
which
stayed
behind
glass
doors
in
the
corner
the
illustrations
i
know
now
were
very
fine
and
even
then
we
found
them
wonderful
then
comes
my
little
old
bible
i
coveted
it
for
years
before
i
got
it
because
it
had
pages
like
notes
i
value
it
now
for
other
reasons
next
the
bible
is
q
of
english
its
brave
leather
cover
rather
impaired
by
the
fact
that
for
two
mornings
boggley
having
mislaid
his
strop
has
stropped
his
razor
on
it
lastly
comes
my
shakespeare
sometimes
in
a
moment
i
wonder
what
the
world
would
have
been
like
had
there
been
no
shakespeare
suppose
we
had
never
known
falstaff
never
heard
the
clown
sing
o
mistress
mine
never
laughed
with
beatrice
nor
masqueraded
with
rosalind
never
thrilled
when
cleopatra
again
for
cydnos
to
meet
mark
antony
cries
give
me
my
robe
put
on
my
crown
i
have
immortal
longings
in
me
what
would
we
do
when
surfeited
with
the
company
of
those
around
us
if
we
could
creep
away
and
pass
for
a
little
while
into
the
company
of
those
immortals
what
does
it
matter
how
tiresome
and
complacent
people
are
when
i
am
orsino
inviting
the
clown
to
sing
words
the
utter
beauty
of
which
bring
the
tears
to
my
eyes
o
fellow
come
the
song
we
had
last
night
mark
it
cesario
it
is
old
and
plain
the
spinsters
and
the
knitters
in
the
sun
and
the
free
maids
that
weave
their
thread
with
bones
do
use
to
chant
it
it
is
silly
sooth
and
dallies
with
the
innocence
of
love
like
the
old
age
one
never
comes
to
the
end
of
the
beauty
only
while
i
was
browsing
for
a
few
minutes
in
a
comedy
i
have
not
much
acquaintance
with
i
happened
on
these
lines
which
i
am
going
to
write
down
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
writing
them
i
am
a
woodland
fellow
sir
that
always
loved
a
great
fire
and
the
master
i
speak
of
ever
keeps
a
good
fire
i
am
for
the
house
with
the
narrow
gate
which
i
take
to
be
too
little
for
pomp
to
enter
some
that
humble
themselves
may
but
the
many
will
be
too
chill
and
tender
and
they
be
for
the
flowery
way
that
leads
to
the
broad
gate
and
the
great
fire
a
very
pleasant
thing
about
our
present
solitude
is
that
one
can
read
aloud
or
speak
to
oneself
without
risk
of
being
thought
demented
the
fact
is
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
village
on
the
outskirts
of
which
we
are
camping
regard
us
as
so
hopelessly
and
utterly
mad
already
that
no
further
display
of
eccentricity
on
our
part
could
make
any
difference
even
in
the
jungle
there
are
servant
troubles
our
cook
finding
i
expect
this
life
too
uneventful
intimated
that
his
father
was
dying
and
left
last
night
we
thought
we
should
have
to
go
without
dinner
but
autolycus
stepping
gallantly
into
the
breach
said
no
he
would
cook
it
he
had
often
cooked
while
with
the
next
we
saw
was
a
hen
flying
wildly
pursued
by
autolycus
and
in
about
half
an
hour
it
appeared
on
the
table
its
legs
still
rather
feathery
sticking
protestingly
from
the
dish
that
was
all
there
was
for
dinner
except
two
of
muddy
coffee
the
d√¢k
came
in
a
little
while
ago
with
the
english
mail
i
have
just
finished
reading
your
letter
i
think
i
know
what
you
must
feel
about
your
book
it
is
sad
to
come
to
the
end
of
a
long
and
pleasant
task
something
finished
you
wo
do
again
a
page
of
life
closed
i
know
it
scares
me
too
how
quickly
things
come
to
an
end
we
are
hurrying
on
so
the
years
pass
so
quickly
that
even
a
long
life
is
a
terribly
short
darg
life
is
such
a
happy
thing
one
would
like
it
to
last
i
was
yesterday
and
if
my
soul
were
to
say
to
me
now
good
lady
the
bright
day
is
i
would
be
most
dreadfully
sorry
and
i
would
expect
everyone
else
to
be
dreadfully
sorry
too
i
afraid
i
would
insist
on
a
great
moaning
at
the
bar
when
i
put
out
to
sea
but
i
would
have
to
admit
that
i
have
had
a
good
time
a
good
good
time
but
i
do
agree
with
you
about
the
darkness
of
what
comes
after
how
can
it
be
dark
when
the
sun
of
righteousness
has
arisen
i
suppose
it
must
be
very
difficult
for
clever
people
to
believe
the
wise
and
prudent
who
demand
a
reason
for
everything
but
christ
said
that
in
this
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
would
confound
the
wise
i
am
glad
he
said
that
i
am
glad
that
sometimes
the
battle
is
to
the
weak
at
the
crossing
i
sink
cried
christian
the
strong
man
i
sink
in
deep
waters
but
went
through
the
river
singing
though
none
could
understand
what
she
said
i
do
know
that
i
could
give
you
a
reason
for
the
hope
that
is
in
me
i
speak
as
one
of
the
foolish
things
but
this
i
know
that
if
we
hold
fast
to
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
the
evidence
of
things
not
seen
looking
to
jesus
the
author
and
finisher
of
our
faith
then
when
the
end
comes
we
shall
be
able
to
lay
our
heads
down
like
children
saying
night
when
i
lie
down
to
in
the
sure
and
certain
hope
that
when
having
done
with
houses
made
with
hands
we
wake
up
in
the
house
of
many
mansions
it
will
be
what
john
bunyan
calls
a
sunshine
morning
i
shall
have
to
stop
writing
though
lecturing
you
is
a
fascinating
pastime
for
the
day
is
almost
done
and
boggley
will
soon
be
home
autolycus
looking
very
worried
is
busied
with
the
task
of
preparing
the
evening
meal
one
of
the
his
gaudy
uniform
laid
aside
and
clad
in
a
fragment
of
cotton
is
sluicing
himself
with
water
and
praying
audibly
the
is
beating
our
clothes
white
on
stones
in
the
tank
in
the
village
the
women
are
grinding
corn
the
oxen
are
drawing
water
from
the
well
the
hangs
in
wisps
on
the
hot
air
and
the
song
of
the
boys
bringing
home
the
cattle
comes
to
me
distinctly
in
the
stillness
the
sunset
colours
are
fading
into
the
deep
blue
of
the
indian
night
and
the
faithful
are
being
called
to
prayer
at
home
they
are
burning
the
whins
on
the
hillsides
and
the
loch
the
lowes
lies
under
the
march
sky
the
land
of
regrets
april
the
of
calcutta
are
wonderfully
pleasant
after
jungly
fare
and
there
is
something
rather
nice
about
a
big
airy
bedroom
with
a
bathroom
to
correspond
hot
water
at
will
and
an
to
look
after
one
clothes
after
the
cramped
space
of
a
tent
a
zinc
bath
wiggling
on
an
uneven
floor
and
autolycus
fumbling
vaguely
among
one
belongings
i
am
staying
with
in
her
sister
townley
very
charming
house
boggley
had
to
go
off
at
once
on
another
short
tour
and
i
was
only
too
pleased
to
come
to
this
most
comfortable
habitation
it
is
nice
to
be
with
again
and
she
has
lots
to
tell
me
about
her
doings
dances
picnics
all
of
which
she
has
enjoyed
thoroughly
all
the
same
i
would
rather
have
had
my
jungle
experiences
she
and
her
sister
and
laugh
greatly
at
my
tales
they
regard
me
as
an
immense
joke
i
do
know
why
i
think
myself
i
am
rather
a
sensible
serious
sort
of
person
townley
is
the
kindest
woman
she
has
such
a
delightful
way
of
making
you
feel
that
you
are
doing
her
the
greatest
favour
by
accepting
her
hospitality
i
am
not
the
only
guest
a
member
of
a
nursing
sisterhood
sister
anna
margaret
is
resting
here
for
a
few
days
she
wears
clothes
quite
like
a
nun
but
she
is
the
cheeriest
soul
with
such
contented
eyes
she
might
be
a
girl
from
the
interest
she
takes
in
our
doings
and
the
way
she
laughs
at
our
but
not
very
witty
fun
calcutta
is
very
hot
the
punkahs
go
all
day
not
the
flapping
kind
of
mofussil
punkahs
but
things
like
bits
of
windmills
fastened
to
poles
i
never
like
to
sit
or
sleep
exactly
underneath
one
they
look
so
insecure
besides
they
make
one
so
untidy
at
a
it
is
really
dreadful
to
have
the
things
above
one
carefully
done
hair
my
hair
needs
no
encouragement
to
get
untidy
and
i
have
quite
an
air
before
we
get
to
the
fish
it
is
too
hot
to
go
out
much
except
very
early
in
the
morning
and
again
after
tea
we
read
and
write
and
work
till
luncheon
then
go
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
till
we
waken
hot
and
very
cross
and
it
is
the
horridest
thing
to
get
up
and
get
into
a
dress
that
seems
to
fasten
with
millions
of
hooks
and
buttons
my
old
bella
is
back
with
me
but
she
has
found
a
mistress
whose
temper
has
shortened
as
the
temperature
has
risen
yesterday
she
fumbled
so
fastening
my
dress
that
i
jumped
round
on
her
stamped
my
foot
and
said
bella
i
shall
slap
you
in
a
minute
she
replied
in
such
a
reproving
tone
oh
missee
baba
tea
makes
one
feel
better
and
then
there
is
tennis
and
a
drive
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
mosquitoes
are
a
great
trial
they
do
worry
so
much
through
the
day
but
at
night
at
night
when
one
with
infinite
care
has
examined
the
inside
of
the
to
make
sure
none
are
lurking
and
then
satisfied
has
dived
into
bed
and
tucked
the
curtain
carefully
round
and
is
just
going
off
to
sleep
sounds
the
hateful
thing
and
all
hope
of
a
quiet
night
is
gone
the
other
night
i
woke
and
found
springing
all
over
her
bed
like
a
kangaroo
at
first
i
thought
she
had
gone
mad
with
the
heat
but
it
turned
out
she
was
only
stalking
a
mosquito
yesterday
we
all
went
townley
sister
anna
margaret
and
i
to
the
calcutta
zoo
we
fed
the
monkeys
with
buns
watched
the
loathly
little
snakes
crawl
among
the
grass
in
their
cages
and
then
began
gratuitously
to
insult
a
large
fierce
tiger
by
poking
at
it
with
her
sunshade
it
was
a
kind
thing
to
do
for
it
is
surely
bad
enough
to
be
caged
without
having
a
sunshade
poked
at
one
and
evidently
the
tiger
thought
so
for
it
lashed
its
tail
and
its
roars
shook
the
cage
we
went
home
and
retribution
followed
swift
and
sure
the
first
floor
of
the
house
consists
of
the
and
two
enormous
bedrooms
one
opening
into
the
other
and
both
opening
by
several
windows
on
to
the
verandah
sister
anna
margaret
is
in
one
and
i
in
the
other
we
have
two
beds
but
they
are
drawn
close
together
and
covered
by
a
last
night
we
went
to
bed
in
our
usual
gay
spirits
and
fell
asleep
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
in
the
zoo
again
and
the
tiger
was
fiercer
than
ever
it
hit
the
bars
with
its
great
paw
and
to
my
horror
i
saw
that
the
bars
were
giving
i
ran
but
it
was
too
late
the
beast
was
out
of
the
cage
and
coming
after
me
with
great
bounds
my
legs
went
round
in
circles
and
made
no
progress
as
legs
do
in
dreams
the
tiger
sprang
and
i
woke
at
first
i
lay
quiet
too
thankful
to
find
myself
in
bed
to
think
about
anything
else
then
i
sniffed
olivia
said
do
you
notice
it
what
i
asked
that
awful
smell
of
zoo
of
course
that
was
it
i
had
been
wondering
what
was
the
curious
smell
my
first
thought
an
awful
one
was
that
the
tiger
had
actually
broken
loose
tracked
us
home
and
was
now
under
the
bed
waiting
to
devour
us
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
it
but
a
how
i
accomplished
it
paralysed
as
i
was
with
terror
i
know
not
but
i
took
a
flying
leap
and
landed
on
hitting
her
nose
with
my
head
and
clutching
wildly
at
her
brawny
arms
much
developed
with
tennis
as
my
only
refuge
she
was
too
terrified
to
resent
my
intrusion
what
do
you
think
it
is
she
whispered
speak
low
perhaps
it
does
know
there
anyone
in
the
room
it
the
tiger
from
the
zoo
i
hissed
with
conviction
started
visibly
rubbish
she
said
a
tiger
would
get
into
a
house
ah
oh
listen
distinctly
we
heard
the
fud
of
four
feet
going
round
the
bed
cry
for
help
said
g
sister
we
yelled
together
sister
anna
sister
anna
margaret
no
answer
sister
anna
margaret
slept
well
sister
said
g
bitterly
she
no
sister
in
adversity
get
up
i
said
encouragingly
get
up
and
turn
on
the
light
perhaps
it
is
a
tiger
perhaps
it
only
a
musk
rat
refused
with
some
curtness
get
up
yourself
she
added
again
we
shouted
for
sister
with
no
result
you
have
no
idea
how
horrible
it
was
to
lie
there
in
the
darkness
and
listen
to
movements
made
by
we
knew
not
what
we
felt
bitterly
towards
sister
anna
never
thinking
of
what
her
feelings
would
be
if
she
came
confidingly
to
our
help
and
was
confronted
by
some
fearsome
animal
if
only
said
we
knew
what
time
it
was
and
when
it
will
be
light
i
ca
like
this
long
let
go
my
arm
ca
you
i
dare
i
said
you
all
i
got
to
hold
on
to
we
lay
and
listened
and
we
lay
and
listened
but
the
padding
footsteps
did
come
back
and
then
i
suppose
we
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
the
next
thing
we
knew
was
that
the
were
standing
beside
us
with
tea
and
the
miserable
night
was
past
and
i
looked
at
each
other
rather
shamefacedly
did
we
dream
it
i
asked
was
rubbing
her
arm
where
i
had
gripped
it
i
did
dream
this
anyway
she
said
it
black
and
blue
at
breakfast
we
knew
the
bitterness
of
having
our
word
doubted
no
one
believed
our
report
they
laughed
at
us
and
said
we
had
dreamt
it
or
that
we
had
heard
a
mouse
and
became
so
offensive
in
their
unbelief
that
and
i
rose
from
the
table
in
a
dignified
way
and
went
out
to
walk
in
the
compound
we
are
very
busy
collecting
things
to
take
home
with
us
did
i
tell
you
berth
had
been
booked
in
the
ship
i
sail
in
the
it
sails
about
the
the
came
this
morning
and
spread
his
wares
on
the
verandah
floor
white
rugs
from
kashmir
embroidered
gaily
in
red
and
green
and
blue
tinsel
mats
and
table
centres
pieces
of
soft
bright
silk
dainty
white
sewed
work
we
could
hardly
be
dragged
from
the
absorbing
sight
to
the
the
townleys
never
change
their
servants
and
now
three
generations
serve
together
the
old
is
the
grandfather
and
trains
his
grandsons
in
the
way
which
they
should
go
at
luncheon
fortunately
we
were
alone
one
of
them
made
a
mistake
in
handing
a
dish
whereupon
his
grandfather
gave
him
a
resounding
box
on
the
ears
knocking
off
his
turban
instead
of
going
out
of
the
room
the
boy
went
on
handing
me
pudding
sobbing
loudly
the
while
and
with
tears
running
down
his
face
it
was
very
embarrassing
and
none
of
us
had
enough
hindustani
to
rebuke
the
grandparent
this
afternoon
when
we
were
having
tea
in
the
garden
and
enjoying
peliti
a
great
outcry
arose
from
the
house
and
we
saw
the
servants
running
and
looking
up
to
the
verandah
townley
called
out
to
know
what
was
the
matter
and
received
such
a
confused
jumble
of
hindustani
in
reply
that
he
went
to
investigate
he
came
back
shrugging
his
shoulders
it
some
nonsense
about
a
they
say
it
been
appearing
suddenly
then
disappearing
for
some
time
now
the
swears
he
saw
it
go
up
the
verandah
into
a
bedroom
to
satisfy
them
i
have
sent
for
my
gun
and
i
wait
below
while
they
drive
the
down
it
our
midnight
visitor
and
i
cried
together
we
waited
breathless
the
servants
rushed
on
to
the
verandah
with
sticks
a
dark
streak
slid
down
the
verandah
pillar
townley
fired
it
was
a
tiger
it
was
a
civet
cat
a
thing
rather
like
a
fox
with
a
long
pointed
nose
and
an
uncommonly
nasty
smell
think
said
as
we
looked
at
it
lying
stretched
out
stiff
think
of
having
that
thing
under
our
bed
a
mouse
indeed
we
did
say
i
told
you
so
but
we
looked
it
boggley
comes
back
and
i
am
going
with
him
to
the
grand
hotel
so
that
we
shall
be
together
for
the
last
little
while
april
from
a
chapter
in
the
from
the
middle
of
the
most
gorgeous
the
mind
of
man
could
invent
i
write
to
you
often
i
have
heard
of
the
taj
mahal
read
of
its
beauty
dreamed
of
its
magic
but
never
in
my
dreams
did
i
imagine
anything
so
exquisite
so
perfect
boggley
thought
i
should
not
leave
india
without
seeing
this
miracle
of
miracles
the
final
wonder
of
the
world
so
we
left
calcutta
on
monday
night
by
the
punjab
mail
and
came
to
agra
and
we
have
done
it
all
in
proper
order
yesterday
in
the
morning
we
motored
to
the
deserted
city
the
capital
of
akbar
the
greatest
of
the
mogul
emperors
about
twenty
miles
off
it
has
battlemented
walls
and
great
gates
like
a
city
the
bazaar
part
of
it
is
mostly
in
ruins
but
the
royal
part
is
perfectly
preserved
and
could
be
lived
in
comfortably
now
there
is
akbar
council
chamber
the
houses
of
his
wives
the
courtyard
where
they
played
living
chess
the
stables
waterworks
the
palaces
of
his
chief
ministers
the
mosque
and
cloisters
the
gate
of
victory
the
carving
in
marble
and
red
sandstone
is
wonderful
akbar
must
have
been
a
man
for
we
found
paintings
of
the
annunciation
side
by
side
with
pictures
of
the
hindu
god
ganesh
it
is
intensely
interesting
to
see
the
place
just
as
it
was
hundreds
of
years
ago
in
the
great
mosque
quadrangle
there
is
a
marble
mausoleum
delicately
carved
a
priceless
piece
of
work
in
erected
to
akbar
high
priest
and
our
guide
was
his
lineal
descendant
glad
to
get
five
rupees
for
his
trouble
we
lunched
in
the
government
bungalow
a
comfortable
place
not
glaringly
out
of
keeping
with
the
surroundings
and
then
motored
to
akbar
tomb
another
piece
of
colossal
magnificence
i
was
awed
by
it
out
of
the
glaring
sunshine
we
went
down
a
long
dark
passage
to
a
great
vault
where
the
air
was
cold
with
the
coldness
of
death
it
was
completely
dark
except
for
one
ray
of
light
falling
on
the
plain
marble
tomb
an
old
mohammedan
crooned
eerily
impressively
a
lament
which
echoed
round
and
round
the
vault
the
mohammedans
and
the
scots
have
a
similar
passion
for
deaths
and
funerals
lastly
in
its
fitting
order
we
drove
to
the
taj
mahal
you
know
the
story
i
have
just
been
reading
about
it
in
book
you
know
how
shah
jehan
grandson
of
akbar
first
mogul
emperor
of
hindustan
loved
and
married
the
beautiful
persian
arjmand
banu
called
and
when
she
died
he
in
his
grief
swore
that
she
should
have
the
loveliest
tomb
the
world
ever
beheld
and
for
seventeen
years
he
built
the
taj
mahal
you
know
how
after
thirty
years
his
son
rose
up
and
dethroned
him
and
kept
him
a
close
prisoner
for
seven
years
in
the
gem
mosque
where
his
daughter
jehanara
attended
him
and
would
not
leave
him
when
grown
very
feeble
he
begged
to
be
laid
where
he
could
see
the
taj
mahal
and
the
request
being
granted
you
know
how
he
died
with
his
face
towards
the
tomb
of
the
beautiful
persian
whose
palankeen
followed
all
his
campaigns
in
the
days
when
empire
was
still
whose
children
called
him
father
arjmand
banu
silent
and
unseen
now
for
years
the
wife
of
his
youth
such
a
passionate
old
story
such
a
marvellous
shah
jehan
grape
garden
golden
pavilion
jasmine
tower
as
steevens
says
there
is
in
the
very
names
i
am
no
more
capable
of
describing
it
than
i
would
have
been
capable
of
building
it
you
must
see
it
for
yourself
it
alone
is
worth
coming
to
india
to
see
leaving
the
taj
mahal
dazed
and
dizzy
with
beauty
i
was
hailed
by
a
voice
that
sounded
familiar
and
turning
round
i
saw
an
incongruous
figure
in
that
arabian
nights
garden
our
old
friend
of
the
the
rocking
horse
fly
she
had
another
female
with
her
and
mr
brand
the
funny
man
who
asked
conundrums
i
afraid
my
eyes
had
asked
what
he
was
doing
in
this
galley
for
he
hastily
said
that
he
had
only
arrived
in
agra
that
morning
and
found
our
acquaintance
at
the
hotel
i
introduced
boggley
and
we
stood
uncomfortably
about
while
the
rocking
horse
fly
waxed
sentimental
over
our
meeting
is
it
odd
she
said
that
we
should
all
meet
and
just
part
again
i
thought
it
would
have
been
much
odder
and
how
infinitely
horrible
if
we
had
all
met
and
never
parted
as
it
happened
we
were
allowed
to
part
with
her
as
soon
as
we
could
have
wished
she
discovered
we
were
staying
at
the
same
hotel
so
we
had
to
dine
together
and
she
talked
the
taj
all
through
dinner
spattering
it
with
adjectives
while
boggley
grunted
at
intervals
it
was
refreshing
to
see
mr
brand
again
he
seems
to
be
enjoying
india
vastly
and
had
three
quite
new
stories
though
if
he
did
laugh
so
much
telling
them
it
would
be
easier
to
see
the
point
boggley
and
he
loved
each
other
at
once
after
dinner
when
the
men
were
smoking
the
rocking
horse
fly
began
to
get
arch
do
you
hate
people
when
they
are
arch
and
said
surely
i
was
never
going
home
without
capturing
some
heart
i
replied
stoutly
and
truthfully
that
i
was
naughty
girl
said
the
you
have
made
the
most
of
your
opportunities
do
you
know
what
they
call
girls
who
come
out
for
the
cold
weather
i
said
i
did
they
are
called
fishing
fleet
she
said
sweetly
i
said
oh
because
i
did
know
what
else
to
say
feeling
as
i
did
so
remiss
i
have
heard
townley
told
me
that
long
ago
when
a
ship
from
england
arrived
in
the
hoogly
a
cannon
was
fired
and
all
the
gay
bachelors
left
their
offices
and
went
to
the
docks
to
appraise
the
new
arrivals
a
ball
was
given
on
board
on
the
night
of
arrival
and
many
of
the
girls
were
engaged
before
they
left
the
ship
i
do
object
to
that
it
was
a
fine
sincere
way
of
doing
things
but
why
the
subject
of
marriage
should
be
made
an
occasion
for
archness
for
sly
looks
for
in
extreme
cases
nudgings
passes
my
comprehension
the
has
a
way
of
making
common
any
subject
she
touches
even
the
taj
and
marriage
so
i
thought
i
would
go
to
bed
as
i
said
goodnight
i
regarded
attentively
the
friend
wondering
much
how
anyone
could
of
choice
accompany
the
in
her
journeyings
she
is
a
very
silent
person
large
and
fat
and
about
forty
and
her
eyes
are
small
out
of
all
proportion
to
her
face
but
they
twinkled
at
me
in
such
an
understanding
way
that
i
generally
so
chary
of
offering
embraces
went
up
to
kiss
her
she
is
kind
but
so
large
that
being
kissed
by
her
is
almost
as
destroying
as
being
in
a
railway
accident
do
i
ignore
what
you
say
in
your
letter
you
see
it
is
rather
difficult
writing
to
a
friend
in
a
far
country
is
like
shouting
through
a
to
the
moon
and
one
ca
shout
very
intimate
things
can
one
let
us
be
sensible
do
be
angry
but
are
you
quite
sure
you
really
care
and
is
it
wise
to
care
we
are
so
very
different
you
are
so
very
english
and
i
in
spite
of
a
pink
and
fluffy
exterior
am
at
heart
as
bitter
and
dour
and
prejudiced
as
any
covenanter
that
ever
whined
a
psalm
my
mind
could
never
have
anything
but
a
scots
accent
you
are
reserved
and
rather
cold
i
am
expansive
to
a
fault
you
are
terrifyingly
clever
my
intelligence
is
of
the
feeblest
you
have
a
refined
sense
of
humour
the
poorest
most
obvious
joke
is
good
enough
for
me
but
this
is
only
talk
i
do
know
that
i
am
in
love
i
do
like
the
expression
anyway
but
this
i
know
that
if
you
were
not
in
the
world
it
would
be
an
unpeopled
waste
to
me
the
place
you
happen
to
be
in
is
where
all
interest
centres
every
minute
of
the
time
as
i
go
through
my
days
laughing
talking
enjoying
myself
vastly
away
at
the
back
of
my
mind
the
thought
of
you
lies
hidden
yet
bright
making
for
me
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
is
this
caring
is
this
what
you
want
to
hear
me
say
i
ca
write
what
i
would
like
i
ca
weave
pretty
things
i
can
only
speak
straight
on
but
oh
my
dear
i
am
so
glad
that
in
this
big
confusing
world
we
have
found
each
other
poor
rocking
horse
fly
poor
fat
friend
how
dull
for
them
how
dull
for
all
the
rest
of
the
people
in
the
world
not
to
have
a
i
am
not
going
to
write
any
more
not
because
i
have
lots
to
say
but
because
writing
much
or
talking
much
about
a
thing
being
queer
and
scots
it
is
hard
for
me
to
say
love
seems
somehow
to
cheapen
it
profane
it
i
have
opened
this
just
to
say
again
my
dear
my
dear
april
only
three
more
days
in
india
and
i
do
know
whether
i
am
horribly
sorry
to
go
or
profoundly
relieved
to
get
away
there
is
no
doubt
it
is
a
sudden
and
dangerous
country
three
people
we
knew
have
died
suddenly
of
cholera
and
two
others
have
had
bombs
thrown
at
them
i
shall
be
thankful
to
find
myself
safely
on
board
the
steamer
but
even
if
i
escape
i
am
leaving
boggley
in
the
midst
of
these
perils
not
that
he
lets
the
thought
of
them
vex
his
soul
you
learn
he
says
to
look
upon
death
in
a
different
way
in
india
but
i
am
sure
i
never
could
learn
to
regard
with
equanimity
the
thought
of
being
quite
well
one
day
and
being
hurried
away
to
the
circular
road
cemetery
early
the
next
it
is
sad
to
die
in
a
foreign
land
and
it
is
somehow
specially
sad
at
least
i
think
so
for
a
scot
to
lie
away
from
home
tell
me
not
the
good
and
wise
care
not
where
their
dust
reposes
that
to
him
who
sleeping
lies
desert
rocks
shall
seem
as
roses
i
been
happy
above
ground
i
could
be
happy
under
out
of
teviot
gentle
sound
part
us
then
not
far
asunder
yesterday
i
saw
a
pathetic
sight
a
couple
in
a
the
man
a
soldier
a
gordon
highlander
and
on
the
front
seat
a
tiny
coffin
the
man
arm
was
round
the
woman
shoulder
and
she
was
crying
bitterly
a
bit
of
shabby
crape
was
tied
round
her
hat
and
she
carried
a
sad
little
wreath
since
coming
back
from
agra
we
have
stayed
at
the
grand
hotel
it
is
a
comfortable
airy
place
wonderfully
pleasant
in
the
morning
when
we
sit
at
a
little
table
in
the
verandah
looking
out
on
the
maidan
and
bring
us
an
excellent
breakfast
our
own
servants
are
with
us
autolycus
and
bella
when
we
arrived
very
early
in
the
morning
and
the
coolies
were
carrying
up
our
luggage
a
servant
sleeping
outside
his
master
door
held
up
his
hand
for
quietness
saying
something
quite
gently
about
not
waking
his
master
beat
him
said
autolycus
to
the
coolies
quite
without
heat
as
he
hurried
on
the
air
gets
hotter
and
everything
looks
more
and
more
tired
every
day
even
april
dressed
in
all
its
trim
ca
put
a
spirit
of
youth
into
anything
but
these
last
days
in
calcutta
in
spite
of
fears
and
heat
are
very
pleasant
i
do
know
how
i
could
have
said
the
calcutta
women
were
horrid
now
that
i
am
going
to
leave
them
they
seem
so
kind
and
attractive
every
minute
of
my
time
is
filled
up
with
tennis
tournaments
dinners
and
theatre
parties
and
my
mornings
are
spent
with
raking
in
queer
shops
for
curiosities
i
am
insatiable
for
things
to
take
home
and
autolycus
has
packed
and
roped
three
large
wooden
boxes
containing
my
treasures
i
wish
life
were
such
a
mixed
thing
just
when
i
am
tiptoeing
on
the
heights
of
joy
because
i
am
going
home
i
am
brought
to
common
earth
with
a
thud
by
the
miserable
thought
that
i
must
leave
boggley
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
have
a
sort
of
spiritual
to
bear
the
nasty
things
in
life
for
one
the
disappointments
the
worries
the
times
of
illness
and
sorrow
the
partings
boggley
says
it
will
be
all
right
once
i
am
away
as
a
rule
he
only
feels
pleasantly
now
with
the
preparations
for
departure
constantly
before
him
helping
to
address
boxes
to
the
familiar
old
places
going
with
me
in
imagination
from
port
to
port
till
we
reach
cool
western
lands
i
afraid
he
has
many
a
pang
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
so
worried
you
will
almost
have
got
my
letter
by
this
time
but
i
wish
i
had
cabled
as
you
asked
only
somehow
i
did
like
the
idea
i
thought
you
knew
i
cared
but
after
all
how
could
you
i
did
know
myself
when
i
left
england
looking
back
i
seem
always
to
have
cared
immensely
how
could
i
help
it
what
i
understand
is
how
every
woman
of
your
acquaintance
does
care
as
i
do
you
seem
to
me
so
lovable
i
am
so
glad
though
it
seems
an
odd
thing
to
be
glad
about
that
you
have
no
mother
and
no
sister
i
do
feel
such
a
marauder
as
i
would
have
done
if
by
taking
you
i
had
robbed
some
other
woman
and
i
am
glad
of
your
lonely
life
i
shall
be
able
to
show
you
what
a
nice
thing
a
home
is
a
quiet
safe
place
we
shall
make
it
where
worldly
cares
may
not
enter
boggley
says
i
can
make
an
hotel
room
look
and
indeed
it
is
almost
my
only
accomplishment
this
talent
for
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
say
to
you
you
know
what
robert
louis
says
about
married
men
that
there
is
no
wandering
in
pleasant
bypaths
for
them
that
the
road
lies
long
and
straight
and
dusty
to
the
grave
it
dulls
me
to
think
of
it
feel
that
do
let
it
be
true
we
let
our
lives
get
dusty
and
straight
and
narrow
we
shall
love
whimsies
and
we
shall
laugh
so
long
as
laughter
is
heartless
and
does
hurt
anyone
it
is
good
to
laugh
life
will
see
to
it
that
there
are
tears
at
least
i
told
so
but
suppose
in
years
to
come
after
we
have
grown
used
to
each
other
though
it
does
amaze
me
that
people
should
talk
about
things
losing
their
charm
because
one
gets
to
them
does
a
child
tire
of
its
mother
because
it
is
used
to
her
is
spring
any
the
less
wonderful
because
we
are
used
to
her
coming
god
grant
we
have
many
years
to
get
used
to
each
other
suppose
one
fine
morning
you
find
that
life
has
lost
its
savour
you
are
tired
of
the
accustomed
round
you
are
tired
of
the
house
you
are
tired
of
the
look
of
the
furniture
you
want
to
get
away
for
a
time
in
a
word
to
be
free
well
remember
you
are
not
to
feel
that
the
road
is
clear
before
you
i
promise
you
not
to
feel
aggrieved
i
sha
wonder
how
my
infinite
variety
could
have
palled
i
know
that
all
men
men
who
are
men
at
times
hear
the
red
gods
call
them
women
hear
them
too
you
know
only
they
have
more
they
find
their
peace
in
fearful
innocence
and
household
laws
and
i
shall
be
waiting
on
the
doorstep
when
you
return
from
climbing
kangchenjunga
or
exploring
the
bramahputra
gorges
ready
to
say
come
away
in
for
i
sure
you
must
be
tired
arthur
dear
am
i
a
disappointing
person
do
you
find
ought
i
to
be
able
to
write
you
different
sorts
of
letters
tenderer
more
loving
letters
but
you
see
it
would
be
me
if
i
could
my
heart
may
be
indeed
i
think
it
is
full
of
the
warmest
instincts
but
they
have
been
unwinged
from
birth
so
they
ca
fly
to
you
one
of
the
most
talkative
people
living
in
some
ways
i
am
strangely
speechless
why
i
have
even
told
boggley
though
if
he
had
eyes
to
see
instead
of
being
the
blindest
of
dear
old
bats
my
shining
face
would
betray
me
i
keep
on
smiling
in
a
perfectly
imbecile
manner
so
that
people
exclaim
well
you
are
indecently
glad
to
get
away
and
when
they
ask
why
i
point
them
to
the
scene
in
the
old
testament
where
hadad
said
unto
pharaoh
me
depart
that
i
may
go
to
mine
own
country
then
pharaoh
said
unto
him
but
what
hast
thou
lacked
with
me
that
behold
thou
seekest
to
go
to
thine
own
country
and
he
answered
nothing
howbeit
let
me
go
in
any
so
it
is
with
me
india
has
given
me
the
best
of
good
times
i
have
lacked
for
nothing
howbeit
let
me
go
in
any
wise
you
need
think
i
am
changed
i
not
i
afraid
i
not
one
would
think
that
a
new
environment
would
make
a
difference
but
it
really
does
not
a
person
with
a
suburban
mind
would
be
as
suburban
in
the
wilds
of
nepal
as
in
the
wilds
of
tooting
the
illuminating
thought
has
come
to
me
that
it
is
a
man
environment
that
matters
it
his
mind
have
you
often
noticed
in
an
evening
in
london
all
the
city
men
hurrying
home
like
rabbits
to
their
burrows
not
the
prosperous
city
men
but
the
lesser
ones
whose
are
rather
shiny
and
their
silk
hats
rather
dull
and
have
you
often
thought
how
narrow
their
lives
are
how
cramping
their
environment
but
suppose
one
of
those
clerks
loves
books
and
is
something
of
a
poet
what
does
it
matter
to
him
though
his
rooms
in
clapham
or
brixton
are
grimy
almost
squalid
and
filled
with
the
worst
kind
of
victorian
furniture
minds
innocent
and
quiet
take
such
for
an
hermitage
once
inside
the
long
day
at
the
office
over
and
the
door
shut
on
the
world
an
drawn
up
to
the
fire
and
his
books
around
him
he
is
as
happy
as
a
king
for
his
mind
to
him
is
a
kingdom
he
may
be
a
puny
little
man
in
bodily
presence
contemptible
but
he
will
feel
no
physical
disabilities
as
he
clambers
on
the
wall
of
jerusalem
with
count
raymond
or
thrills
as
he
sets
forth
with
drake
to
fight
spaniards
one
against
ten
instead
of
the
raucous
cries
of
the
milk
or
the
coal
man
he
hears
the
horns
of
elfland
faintly
blowing
and
instead
of
a
window
which
can
show
him
nothing
but
a
sodden
plot
planted
with
shrubs
he
has
the
key
of
that
magic
casement
which
opens
on
perilous
seas
in
fairylands
forlorn
he
will
never
do
anything
great
in
the
world
he
will
never
lead
a
forlorn
hope
or
marry
the
princess
or
see
far
lands
he
will
never
be
anything
but
a
poor
shabby
clerk
but
he
is
of
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
god
has
given
to
him
his
fairyland
no
i
do
think
a
new
environment
changes
people
and
it
is
foolish
to
think
it
makes
them
forget
sometimes
in
the
eden
gardens
at
sunset
when
we
draw
up
to
listen
to
the
band
i
watch
the
faces
of
the
youths
scots
boys
come
out
from
glasgow
and
dundee
dreaming
there
in
the
indian
twilight
while
the
pipers
play
the
tunes
familiar
to
them
since
childhood
they
are
sahibs
out
here
they
have
a
horse
to
ride
and
a
servant
to
look
after
them
things
they
never
would
have
had
had
they
stayed
in
dundee
or
glasgow
but
though
they
are
proud
they
are
lonely
what
does
grandeur
matter
if
the
quothquan
folk
ca
see
it
the
peepul
trees
rustle
softly
overhead
the
languorous
soft
air
laps
them
round
the
scent
of
the
east
is
in
their
nostrils
but
their
eyes
are
with
their
hearts
and
is
this
what
they
see
a
night
of
drizzling
rain
a
street
of
tall
dingy
grey
houses
and
a
boy
his
day
work
done
bounding
upstairs
three
steps
at
a
time
to
a
cosy
kitchen
where
the
tea
is
spread
where
hands
at
his
coming
lift
the
brown
teapot
from
the
hob
and
a
kind
voice
welcomes
him
home
at
the
end
of
the
day
autolycus
has
knocked
at
the
door
to
say
master
come
he
likes
to
be
very
european
with
me
so
does
call
him
sahib
and
i
must
go
to
tea
boggley
is
taking
the
whole
day
off
and
we
have
got
it
all
planned
out
every
minute
of
it
in
the
morning
we
shall
drive
in
a
to
the
stores
to
buy
some
final
necessaries
such
as
soap
and
then
to
peliti
to
eat
ices
then
to
the
shop
in
park
street
so
that
boggley
may
get
me
a
delayed
birthday
present
then
round
and
round
the
maidan
we
shall
go
to
luncheon
at
the
townleys
and
go
on
with
them
to
tollygunge
for
golf
we
are
going
to
tea
with
some
people
who
are
taking
us
a
motor
run
we
go
to
a
farewell
dinner
at
the
ormondes
then
we
shall
go
to
bed
bless
you
my
dear
socotra
homeward
bound
somewhere
in
the
hoogly
april
this
day
seems
to
have
been
going
on
for
weeks
and
it
is
only
now
was
it
only
this
morning
that
we
left
i
ca
think
it
was
morning
that
boggley
and
i
took
our
last
together
and
boggley
as
he
gloomily
sugared
his
tea
said
now
i
know
what
a
condemned
man
feels
like
on
the
morning
of
his
execution
then
we
laughed
and
it
was
so
bad
autolycus
very
important
because
the
miss
sahib
was
going
to
cross
the
black
water
bustled
about
with
my
few
packages
all
the
heavy
baggage
went
away
two
days
ago
and
finally
bustled
us
into
a
in
such
good
time
that
we
had
to
drive
twice
round
the
maidan
before
we
went
to
the
dear
funny
autolycus
i
shall
miss
his
ugly
honest
face
he
has
added
greatly
to
the
gaiety
of
nations
as
represented
by
boggley
and
me
the
last
we
saw
of
him
was
standing
before
the
hotel
door
along
with
bella
and
the
two
bowing
low
and
murmuring
salaam
miss
sahib
salaam
while
i
undignified
to
the
last
knelt
on
the
seat
and
wildly
waved
a
handkerchief
the
landing
was
crowded
with
people
i
wondered
how
we
were
all
to
get
on
board
one
ship
but
found
as
we
got
on
to
the
launch
that
most
of
the
people
remained
behind
they
were
only
off
townley
had
by
some
means
managed
to
get
permission
for
himself
his
wife
and
boggley
to
go
down
the
river
with
us
in
the
launch
to
where
the
lay
which
was
a
great
comfort
to
us
all
when
we
found
our
party
poor
face
was
much
less
pink
than
usual
the
ormondes
were
there
having
ridden
down
to
see
us
off
and
quite
a
lot
of
other
people
had
come
for
the
same
reason
we
the
passengers
had
to
be
medically
examined
before
we
were
allowed
to
leave
in
case
of
plague
i
suppose
and
i
were
rather
scared
at
the
thought
how
were
we
to
know
that
we
had
plague
lurking
about
us
however
after
a
very
cursory
glance
we
were
passed
on
got
our
said
and
embarked
on
the
launch
at
any
other
time
i
would
have
hated
saying
to
the
ormondes
and
the
other
dear
people
but
with
the
parting
from
boggley
looming
so
near
i
was
and
callous
though
i
hope
i
did
appear
so
the
is
quite
a
tiny
ship
compared
to
the
and
i
clambered
on
board
in
great
haste
to
find
our
cabin
we
found
it
already
occupied
by
our
cabin
companion
she
is
scotch
and
has
artificial
teeth
and
a
fine
rich
glasgow
accent
and
i
think
is
of
a
gentle
and
yielding
disposition
and
an
enormous
boggley
was
with
us
but
when
he
saw
we
were
going
to
be
firm
he
fled
this
said
waving
her
hand
towards
the
offending
box
must
go
into
the
certainly
said
the
glasgow
woman
i
sure
i
do
know
what
doing
here
ma
husband
wrote
the
labels
and
she
actually
began
to
drag
it
into
the
passage
seeing
her
so
amenable
to
reason
we
smiled
kindly
and
begged
her
to
desist
but
she
said
not
at
all
and
smiled
back
in
such
a
delightfully
glasgow
way
that
my
heart
warmed
to
her
i
can
see
she
will
be
a
constant
entertainment
townley
introduced
us
to
the
captain
who
looks
kind
and
who
asked
us
to
sit
at
his
table
and
then
we
all
went
in
to
breakfast
in
spite
of
our
low
spirits
we
enjoyed
the
meal
created
something
of
a
fracas
about
a
kidney
which
she
ate
and
then
said
was
bad
but
she
calmed
down
and
we
enjoyed
looking
at
the
other
passengers
speculating
as
to
who
and
what
they
were
almost
directly
after
breakfast
our
people
had
to
go
and
and
i
very
stricken
watched
the
launch
as
it
steamed
up
the
river
till
lost
to
sight
behind
a
big
vessel
since
then
except
for
an
interval
in
the
cabin
to
get
our
eyes
bathed
into
decency
we
have
sat
on
deck
with
aching
heads
trying
to
read
and
write
at
first
the
heat
was
terrible
we
drooped
like
candles
in
the
sun
we
wilted
like
flowers
and
gasped
if
all
the
voyage
is
going
to
be
as
hot
as
this
done
limp
and
wretched
i
agreed
with
her
then
we
found
we
had
put
our
chairs
against
the
kitchen
which
is
up
on
deck
in
this
ship
no
wonder
we
were
warm
we
quickly
found
a
cooler
spot
and
i
have
been
writing
a
long
letter
to
boggley
to
send
off
with
the
pilot
is
he
pure
gold
my
boggley
i
know
that
you
too
think
nobly
of
the
soul
he
will
be
home
in
a
year
and
i
am
trying
to
tell
myself
that
a
year
is
long
well
the
indian
trip
is
over
and
i
have
a
lot
learned
a
few
things
and
made
some
friends
best
of
them
my
faithful
it
is
rather
astonishing
that
i
should
have
the
joy
of
her
company
home
again
many
people
i
am
sure
expected
she
would
remain
in
india
but
i
think
she
took
the
precaution
to
leave
her
heart
at
home
wise
one
thing
you
should
be
thankful
for
there
will
be
no
more
letters
what
a
blessing
people
are
nicer
than
their
letters
how
good
you
have
been
about
mine
how
willing
to
take
an
interest
in
the
people
i
met
in
the
places
i
saw
in
everything
i
told
you
about
and
when
i
was
jocose
you
pretended
to
be
amused
ah
well
be
cheerful
sir
our
revels
now
are
ended
and
so
i
am
going
home
home
to
my
own
bleak
kindly
land
place
of
all
weathers
that
end
in
rain
i
am
going
home
to
my
own
people
i
think
i
see
peter
jigging
up
and
down
in
expectation
before
my
trunks
and
i
am
going
to
you
and
the
queer
thing
is
i
ca
feel
glad
i
am
so
for
india
all
my
horror
of
bombs
and
sudden
death
has
gone
and
memory
as
someone
says
is
making
magic
carpets
under
my
feet
so
that
i
am
back
again
in
the
white
hot
sunlight
under
the
dusty
hearing
the
creak
of
the
wagons
as
the
patient
oxen
toil
on
the
long
straight
roads
and
the
songs
of
the
coolies
returning
home
at
even
i
see
the
country
lying
vague
in
the
clammy
morning
mist
and
the
great
broad
ganges
glimmering
wanly
and
again
it
is
a
wonderful
clear
night
of
stars
i
know
that
my
own
land
is
the
best
land
that
the
fat
babu
with
his
carefully
oiled
and
parted
hair
and
his
ca
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
the
britisher
that
our
daffodils
and
primroses
are
sweeter
far
than
the
blossoms
of
the
east
that
the
bird
of
india
is
a
wretched
substitute
for
the
lark
and
the
thrush
and
others
of
god
jocund
little
fowls
that
abana
and
pharpar
and
other
rivers
of
damascus
are
better
than
this
jordan
all
this
i
say
i
know
but
i
do
believe
it
india
has
thrown
golden
dust
in
my
eyes
and
i
am
seeing
things
all
wrong
we
have
anchored
for
the
night
i
am
watching
the
misty
green
blur
which
is
all
that
is
left
to
me
of
india
grow
more
and
more
indistinct
as
darkness
falls
soon
it
will
be
night
who
has
been
absolutely
silent
for
more
than
an
hour
sat
up
suddenly
just
now
and
took
my
hand
olivia
she
said
it
a
nice
place
england
her
tone
was
the
tone
of
one
seeking
reassurance
it
is
i
said
dolefully
and
it
really
does
rain
such
a
great
deal
no
anyway
it
home
and
india
is
though
india
been
jolly
she
sighed
then
i
shall
enjoy
a
slice
of
good
roast
beef
