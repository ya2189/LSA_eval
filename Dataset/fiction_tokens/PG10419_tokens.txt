heroic

in

the

there
is
no
country
or
township
known
that
can
ever
compare
against
the
beauty
and
magnitude
of
the
marvelous
land
of
oz
this
is
not
a
debatable
issue
the
land
of
oz
is
not
only
beautiful
with
the
glittering
gemstones
that
are
found
commonplace
in
this
remarkable
fairyland
but
its
enchantment
goes
ever
farther
in
all
the
territory
of
oz
there
is
clean
fresh
air
and
gorgeous
trees
and
scenery
there
is
peace
and
quiet
when
such
is
desired
and
there
is
high

excitement

no

than
he

and
death

of
the
country
is
situated
in
the
center
of
a
vast
continent
and
is
surrounded
by
an
impassable
deadly
desert
although
the
vast
deadly
desert
around
oz
aptly
prevents
tourism
from
abroad
those
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
live
on
the
proper
side
of
this
sandy
enigma
will
surely
testify
that
the
land
is
as
no
other
the
country
itself
is
divided
into
five
distinct
regions
the
most
important
of
these
is
the
emerald
city
this
famous
area
lies
in
the
exact
center
of
the
oblong
land
and
is
home
to
the
supreme
ruler
over
oz
her
name
is
ozma
and
she
is
but
a
tiny
child
even
so
no
other
ruler
in
any
other
country
has
ever
been
more
respected
loved
or
envied
to
the
south
of
ozma
remarkable
palace
is
the
quadling
country
this
is
ruled
over
by
a
powerful
witch
named
glinda
the
good
in
the
quadling
country
red
is
the
favored
color
and
most
of
the
buildings
walls
and
furniture
are
distinctly
red
in
hue
to
the
west
lies
the
winkie
country
which
is
a
land
where
everything
is
bright
and
to
the
north
is
the
purple
gillikin
territory
and
to
the
east
live
the
munchkins
among
these
little
people
blue
was
clearly
the
color
of
preference
it
is
to
this
easternmost
region
that
i
wish
to
direct
your
attention
it
was
in
the
blue
munchkin
country
of
oz
that
a
house
happened
to
fall
from
the
sky
and
land
with
a
loud
crash
atop
a
most
unfortunate
wicked
witch
now
although
this
particular
wicked
witch
was
about
as
repugnant
as
they
come
and
her
evil
doings
had
brought
more
misery
to
more
people
than
can
possibly
be
recorded
in
these
few
pages
it
was
still
rather
sad
to
see
her
wicked
legacy
brought
to
such
an
abrupt
close
especially
as
the
particular
house
that
happened
to
squish
her
was
one
which
belonged
to
a
tiny
little
girl
named
dorothy
gale
to
think
that
a
mere
toddler
could
bring
an
end
to
the
story
of
the
wicked
witch
of
the
east
but
the
story
did
not
exactly
end
there
it
seems
that
before
such
time
as
the
old
woman
liveliness
was
shmushed
by
little
dorothy
home
she
had
left
a
little
souvenir
to
remember
her
by
actually
it
was
quite
a
large
souvenir
she
and
her
sister
allidap
the
wicked
witch
of
the
west
had
created
the
souvenir
to
do
battle
with
the
wonderful
wizard
of
oz
himself
had
it
not
been
for
the
wizard
powerful
magic
charms
he
may
well
have
been
defeated
but
thanks
to
his
magic
the
wizard
of
oz
was
able
to
thwart
the
attacks
of
the
witches
and
banish
their
souvenir
to
a
forest
that
lay
in
the
southern
land
of
the
quadlings
but
fearing
the
witches
may
try
to
attack
him
again
the
wizard
hid
himself
away
in
the
glorious
emerald
city
and
became
a
hermit
then
one
day
dorothy
house
came
down
and
whumped
out
the
wicked
witch
of
the
east
this
needless
to
say
was
not
a
healthy
situation
for
the
wicked
witch
little
dorothy
was
advised
in
the
munchkin
country
to
head
for
the
central
city
and
seek
out
the
reclusive
old
wizard
being
told
that
he
alone
could
help
her
to
get
home
to
kansas
it
was
a
long
and
difficult
journey
but
the
child
was
equal
to
the
challenge
along
the
way
she
chanced
to
meet
up
with
the
cowardly
lion
he
was
a
formerly
respected
leader
of
the
animal
kingdom
but
this
particular
lion
had
fallen
into
disgrace
due
to
his
outlandishly
unkinglike
cowardice
he
and
the
little
girl
became
fast
friends
and
they
journeyed
together
in
search
of
oz
and
later
on
glinda
the
good
it
was
on
their
journey
to
locate
glinda
the
good
that
they
happened
to
stray
into
the
very
forest
where
the
witches
souvenir
was
staying
as
they
walked
through
the
vast
forest
a
large
and
tawny
tiger
approached
the
cowardly
lion
and
bowed
subjectively
before
him
welcome
o
king
of
beasts
quoth
the
tiger
you
have
come
in
good
time
to
fight
our
enemy
and
bring
peace
to
all
the
animals
of
the
forest
once
more
what
is
your
trouble
asked
the
cowardly
lion
in
a
quiet
voice
we
are
all
threatened
answered
the
tiger
by
a
fierce
enemy
which
has
lately
come
into
this
forest
it
is
a
most
tremendous
monster
like
a
great
spider
with
a
body
as
big
as
an
elephant
and
legs
as
long
as
a
tree
trunk
it
has
eight
of
these
long
legs
and
as
the
monster
crawls
through
the
forest
he
seizes
an
animal
with
a
leg
and
drags
it
to
his
mouth
where
he
eats
it
as
a
spider
does
a
fly
not
one
of
us
is
safe
while
this
fierce
creature
is
alive
and
we
had
called
a
meeting
to
decide
how
to
take
care
of
ourselves
when
you
came
among
us
the
cowardly
lion
thought
over
the
situation
carefully
are
there
any
other
lions
in
this
forest
he
enquired
no
there
were
some
but
the
monster
has
eaten
them
all
and
besides
they
were
none
of
them
nearly
so
large
and
brave
as
you
the
lion
got
an
idea
that
he
hoped
would
help
him
overcome
his
disgrace
if
i
put
an
end
to
your
enemy
he
began
will
you
bow
down
to
me
and
obey
me
as
king
of
the
forest
we
will
do
that
gladly
returned
the
big
tiger
the
rest
of
the
forest
animals
voiced
assent
where
is
this
great
spider
of
yours
now
asked
the
cowardly
lion
bravely
yonder
said
the
tiger
indicating
with
a
tawny
paw
among
the
oak
trees
the
cowardly
lion
overcame
his
fear
and
ignored
the
trepidation
within
his
heart
he
came
upon
the
forest
monster
shortly
thereafter
even
though
it
was
sound
asleep
it
was
the
most
ghastly
sight
that
the
cowardly
lion
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
it
was
huge
black
and
furry
it
was
filthy
too
its
putrid
smell
had
the
lion
reeling
in
spite
of
himself
but
he
pressed
onward
the
snores
of
the
ugly
monster
revealed
its
fangs
which
measured
in
at
at
least
a
foot
long
its
powerful
legs
were
as
muscular
as
those
of
a
hercules
and
were
as
big
around
as
a
house
and
as
long
as
the
trunk
of
a
tree
the
claws
on
the
end
of
its
eight
enormous
legs
were
curved
and
as
sharp
as
scimitars
it
was
quite
the
sort
of
thing
that
nightmares
are
made
of
but
the
cowardly
lion
noticed
that
the
forest
monster
had
one
weakness
he
was
observant
enough
to
notice
that
though
the
spider
was
so
much
larger
than
any
other
spider
he
had
ever
seen
its
neck
was
as
slender
as
a
wasp
waist
given
this
obvious
oversight
on
the
part
of
the
wicked
witches
who
had
designed
him
the
forest
monster
suddenly
seemed
less
monstrous
to
the
cowardly
lion
with
a
leap
and
a
single
blow
of
his
mighty
paw
he
knocked
the
forest
monster
head
clean
off
he
then
watched
the
writhing
body
until
its
legs
stopped
wiggling
and
he
knew
that
it
was
quite
dead
illustration
a
leap
and
a
single
blow
of
his
mighty
paw
he
knocked
the
forest
monster
head
clean
off
chapter

day
elephant
asked
tweaty
a
yellow
canary
who
was
looking
up
at
the
large
gray
beast
yes
asked
the
elephant
who
was
drinking
a
tall
glass
of
chocolate
milk
with
his
trunk
i
was
just
thinking
about
the
new
queen
of
oz
said
the
bird
solemnly
do
you
think
she
last
i
mean
i
really
thought
that
the
wonderful
wizard
of
oz
himself
would
rule
over
the
land
forever
then
i
placed
my
confidence
in
his
majesty
the
scarecrow
now
out
of
the
blue
we
got
this
little
girl
who
is
probably
younger
than
most
eggs
and
we
are
supposed
to
give
her
our
neverending
support
why
in
the
world
not
the
pachyderm
drawled
as
he
indolently
stretched
himself
nibbles
and
i
agree
that
though
she
is
very
young
princess
ozma
shows
a
lot
of
promise
as
oz
new
leader
give
the
child
a
chance
she
only
been
a
queen
for
a
week
or
so
absolutely
tweaty
nibbles
agreed
and
so
many
rulers
have
been
youthful
remember
the
old
story
about
king
tut
he
was
just
a
little
boy
few
persons
guessed
that
nibbles
elephant
and
tweaty
were
old
friends
so
unlike
were
they
in
appearance
and
disposition
tweaty
was
delicate
clean
and
could
sing
for
hours
on
end
without
repeating
a
tune
he
took
pride
in
his
appearance
and
always
made
sure
that
his
refulgent
feathers
were
clean
nibbles
on
the
other
hand
was
a
mouse
he
was
often
found
digging
in
the
trash
that
was
sometimes
left
by
careless
campers
or
burrowing
in
other
animals
nests
his
fur
was
not
what
most
would
deem
tidy
but
he
was
amiable
and
companionable
elephant
by
far
the
largest
of
the
three
was
less
colorful
he
liked
the
other
animals
and
he
ofttimes
wanted
to
help
the
smaller
creatures
as
best
he
could
but
his
immense
size
and
bulk
generally
made
him
feel
more
like
a
nuisance
than
a
help
in
spite
of
legends
that
would
have
us
all
believe
that
elephants
are
afraid
of
mice
he
found
that
most
of
his
favorite
playmates
were
among
the
smaller
creatures
of
oz
he
enjoyed
fellowship
with
mice
as
well
as
with
rabbits
and
hedgehogs
he
had
befriended
nibbles
at
a
young
age
and
it
had
been
nibbles
who
had
introduced
him
to
tweaty
the
three
friends
were
enjoying
a
relaxing
afternoon
in
a
remote
region
of
the
munchkin
country
known
as
the
lunechien
forest
it
was
a
time
of
transition
in
the
land
of
oz
the
child
queen
ozma
of
oz
had
just
been
named
ruler
over
the
land
this
news
had
met
with
mixed
reactions
many
ozites
maintained
that
only
the
wonderful
wizard
could
rule
the
land
others
favored
the
amiable
scarecrow
but
all
admitted
that
even
though
a
tiny
little
girl
ozma
was
a
unique
leader
she
had
already
proven
that
she
had
not
only
created
and
brought
to
life
a
man
named
jack
a
wooden
sawhorse
and
a
wobbly
monstrosity
with
the
head
of
a
gump
but
had
also
gone
forth
with
these
unlikely
companions
and
saved
the
land
of
oz
from
a
terrible
fate

should
be

this

should
learn
to
play
jacks
or
skip

she
should
have
some

she

remarked
half
to
himself

tweaty
demanded
in
surprise
that
is
hardly
a
reason
to
elect
someone
leader
especially
over
such
a
vast
country
as
oz
maybe
if
oz
were
a
little
dinky
insignificant
country
like
america
or
kansas
it
would
be
okay
but
oz
is
so
much
bigger
than
those
places

you

that
adorable
infant
deserves
a
childhood
to
enjoy
before
getting
schlepped
into
queenhood
unprepared
before
elephant
could
reply
an
unexpected
occurrence
drove
all
idle
thoughts
from
his

it
all
happened
in
an
instant
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
the
top
of
the
sky
an
unearthly
roar
issued
forth
it
was
as
as
a
scream
yet
as
sinister
as
a
red
dragon
growl
then
before
the
horrified
trio
a
gigantic
spider
loomed
before
them
it
looked
as
if
it
were
hungry
and
it
was
so
uncannily
big
that
it
could
easily
have
devoured
all
three
of
them
in
an
instant
it
might
have
too
had
it
not
been
distracted
by
the
sight
of
a
small
yellow
cat
which
was
darting
by

in

tummy
but
my
little
lovebug
is
special
she
does
go
in
my
tummy
instead
she
gets
to
stay
wound
up
in
my
web
only
to
be
let
free
long
enough
to
give
me
what
i
need
what
is
that
asked
elephant
with
a
shudder
the
biggest
and
grandest
thing
in
the
universe
is
of
course
true
love
even
though
shaped
a
bit
like
a
cockroach
my
lovebug
can
produce
the
stuff
inside
her
teeny
little
heart
all
i
have
to
do
is
chant
a
certain
incantation
and
then
to
have
her
kiss
me
once
or
twice
each
day
and
i
stay
as
big
as
i
like
but
that
is
terrible
said
tweaty
you
ca
abuse
love
that
way
love
is
supposed
to
be
beautiful
and
friendly
and
stuff
like
that
to
cheapen
this
sacred
gift
by
forcing
someone
into
submission
by
magic
or
force
is
an
abuse
of
love
and
not
what
the
gods
had
in
mind
for
us
at
all
if
you
are
making
this
your
slave
you
are
abusing
the
whole
concept
and
also
missing
the
point
with
another
tremendous
roar
the
huge
spider
was
gone
he
obviously
did
not
care
for
any
more
lecturing
that
day
good
riddance
i
say
spoke
nibbles
that
big
old
thing
was
ugly
and
it
smelled
awful
where
fisher
asked
elephant
i
think
the
thingy
ate
her
up
after
all
i
sure
hope
not
i
fine
came
the
feline
meow
is
that
beast
gone
away
yet
it
has
answered
the
pachyderm
oddly
neither
nibbles
nor
tweaty
felt
the
slightest
tinge
of
fear
at
the
sight
of
the
cat
in
oz
natural
enemies
ofttimes
become
the
dearest
of
friends
indeed
oz
is
a
truly
remarkable
land
i
think
i
saw
all
nine
of
my
lives
flash
before
me
that
time
said
the
cat
what
in
the
heck
that
thing
that
had
me
i
do
know
said
elephant
but
i
hope
we
never
see
it
again
but
you
have
to
rescue
that
poor
little
insect
said
an
earthworm
poking
her
head
out
of
the
ground
did
you
bozos
hear
what
that
thing
said
about
lovebug
he
got
her
stuck
in
his
sticky
web
and
he
is
treating
her
like
a
slave
and
he
even
making
her
ugh
kiss
him
how
yucky
can
you
get
you
must
save
that
poor
little
bug
she
is
a
good
bug
love
is
always
good
please
help
her
please
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
her
in
that
predicament
it
a
stupid
bug
for
crying
out
loud
said
tweaty
do
you
think
that
we
have
more
important
things
to
do
than
to
go
and
save
a
stupid
bug
but
this
is
oz
where
everyone
is
equal
nibbles
pointed
out
even
a
cat
like
fisher
is
our
friend
in
this
fantastic
country
i
think
that
even
a
tiny
insect
is
not
beneath
our
concern
i
think
we
should
save
her
give
me
a
break
tweaty
said
i
not
about
to
face
that
big
ugly
monster
again
for
the
sake
of
a
cockroach
she
is
not
a
cockroach
said
the
worm
she
is
a
kindly
insect
who
helps
people
in
need
to
feel
cared
about
she
has
great
powers
to
do
that
for
people
but
that
spider
is
misusing
her
powers
and
making
her
serve
him
in
a
most
wicked
capacity
against
her
will
he
is
abusing
her
and
she
is
probably
miserable
how
can
you
let
him
treat
such
a
sweet
being
in
such
an
awful
manner
i
for
one
am
willing
to
try
to
help
save
lovebug
said
elephant
me
too
said
nibbles
i
think
before
tweaty
could
finish
his
sentence
a
loud
scream
was
heard
hurrying
toward
the
sound
they
found
louie
the
lobo
with
a
pale
expression
what
happened
asked
elephant
something
took
tiger
he
said
i
did
see
who
it
was
but
something
took
him
away
while
we
were
talking
about
the
tin
woodman
i
do
know
who
would
do
such
a
foul
thing
tiger
is
my
best
friend
i
yelled
at
the
kidnapper
but
to
no
avail
i
have
lost
my
best
friend
he
began
to
cry
like
a
kitten
it
must
have
been
that
awful
forest
nibbles
swallowed
hard
i
know
it
was
he
who
did
this
he
is
so
horrific
we
must
get
word
to
the
new
queen
we
really
must
i
agree
wholeheartedly
spoke
elephant
we
can
not
allow
this
sort
of
thing
to
happen
do
you
remember
the
last
time
enslavement
was
happening
here
in
our
munchkin
country
i
do
said
the
mouse
it
was
when
that
wicked
witch
had
us
all
enslaved
oh
she
was
ever
so
much
worse
than
i
had
ever
realized
glad
that
house
fell
down
and
made
her
into
mush
but
we
can
not
count
on
any
houses
falling
down
on
this
spider
man
said
tweaty
with
certainty
you
are
quite
right
when
you
say
that
we
should
do
something
about
it
i
was
being
awfully
selfish
when
i
refused
to
do
anything
to
help
that
little
bug
but
now
my
eyes
are
opened
to
think
that
not
even
a
tiger
is
safe
in
that
monster
wake
this
means
sure
danger
for
birds
and
mice
and
elephants
too
then
let
go
and
inform
the
new
queen
straightaway
trumpeted
elephant
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
she
has
the
power
to
help
us
if
anyone
does
but
we
should
have
something
to
show
her
to
prove
that
we
are
not
insane
said
nibbles
after
all
who
would
ever
believe
that
such
a
beast
could
exist
it
is
natural
and
besides
he
cut
his
sentence
short
when
his
eye
fell
upon
a
large
marking
on
the
ground
gads
exclaimed
elephant
that
is
one
of
the
monster
footprints
goodness
just
look
how
deep
it
is
that
creature
must
weigh
a
million
tons
yes
agreed
tweaty
flittering
into
the
hole
this
footprint
is
almost
as
big
around
as
a
horse
and
look
at
the
size
of
those
claws
i
bet
it
could
rip
elephant
in
two
without
even
straining
itself
let
not
discuss
that
shuddered
the
pachyderm
but
i
think
we
should
save
this
footprint
for
the
queen
because
she
is
a
mere
child
she
will
be
most
impressed
by
its
mass
i
think
we
should
make
a
cast
of
it
and
carry
it
to
the
emerald
city
to
show
her
what
we
are
up
against
nibbles
and
tweaty
hurriedly
went
to
a
nearby
maple
tree
and
gnawed
at
its
trunk
for
a
time
with
elephant
help
they
poured
some
maple
syrupy
sap
into
the
footprint
elephant
blew
on
this
with
his
strong
lungs
until
it
hardened
then
there
before
the
trio
was
a
perfect
cast
of
the
forest
monster
footprint
eagerly
elephant
snatched
it
up
in
his
trunk
and
flung
it
onto
his
back
let
get
on
our
way
he
said
the
other
two
nestled
upon
his
head
and
they
were
off
to
the
emerald
city
of
oz
chapter
an
unlikely
trio
of
friends
elephant
tweaty
and
nibbles
were
ready
to
leave
and
it
seemed
that
dozens
of
other
forest
animals
were
of
the
same
mind
the
ferocity
of
the
forest
monster
had
led
many
of
the
denizens
of
the
lunechien
forest
to
panic
many
of
them
wanted
to
tell
the
lord
of
the
forest
about
the
trouble
while
others
elected
to
go
to
glinda
the
good
who
ruled
over
the
neighboring
land
of
the
quadlings
animals
were
running
to
and
fro
and
there
was
a
mass
of
confusion
look
out
nibbles
cried
suddenly
that
unicorn
is
coming
right
at
us
elephant
was
helpless
in
trying
to
avert
the
disaster
an
abnormally
frightened
unicorn
undoubtedly
made
nervous
by
the
excitement
had
lost
control
of
her
footing
she
plowed
into
the
rear
of
the
elephant
with
a
jolt
which
nearly
flung
the
two
passengers
on
his
head
into
glowing
limbo
retrieving
his
companions
and
determining
that
they
were
unhurt
he
listened
for
a
few
moments
to
the
apologies
of
the
unicorn
and
then
set
out
again
i
sure
hope
that
queen
ozma
can
do
something
about
that
ugly
brute
said
nibbles
if
she
ca
we
be
no
worse
off
than
when
we
started
replied
tweaty
the
subject
was
dropped
there
elephant
had
run
most
rapidly
and
the
trio
was
now
approaching
the
emerald
city
excuse
me
said
the
man
at
the
gate
who
are
you
and
what
is
your
business
in
the
emerald
city
we
want
to
see
the
child
who
has
become
our
queen
replied
elephant
on
what
grounds
on
the
ground
i
walking
upon
now
i
suppose
is
there
a
problem
what
is
your
business
with
the
queen
if
you
are
here
to
make
fun
of
her
age
you
are
welcome
to
go
away
queen
ozma
was
sent
to
us
by
the
fairy
queen
lurliné
herself
and
she
has
our
respect
even
though
she
is
a
tiny
child
she
is
not
to
be
made
sport
of
no
one
is
making
sport
of
anyone
said
elephant
gruffly
though
if
you
do
get
out
of
my
way
i
may
decide
to
use
you
for
a
football
that
will
not
be
necessary
said
the
guard
but
you
will
need
to
wear
green
glasses
it
is
a
rule
that
was
set
up
by
the
wonderful
wizard
of
oz
himself
it
is
because
of
the
gleaming
magnitude
of
all
the
big
gemstones
everywhere
if
you
do
wear
these
special
glasses
you
might
well
be
blinded
by
their
brilliance
i
hope
you
wo
object
to
this
well
said
elephant
i
fear
that
your
glasses
will
not
fit
someone
my
size
nor
for
that
matter
the
smaller
sizes
of
my
companions
jeepers
said
the
guard
i
had
thought
of
that
perhaps
right
he
practically
threw
himself
into
his
chestful
of
green
glasses
but
found
none
that
would
fit
the
animals
i
guess
i
have
to
make
you
some
this
may
take
a
while
so
you
have
to
find
something
to
do
in
the
mean
how
about
we
go
and
talk
to
the
queen
while
you
make
us
our
glasses
suggested
nibbles
a
grand
idea
replied
the
guard
he
opened
the
gate
and
the
company
entered
the
emerald
city
of
oz
is
a
truly
remarkable
place
it
has
had
so
many
volumes
written
about
it
that
it
hardly
needs
a
description
here
but
it
should
be
noted
that
our
trio
was
most
impressed
ozma
too
was
very
impressive
they
came
upon
her
while
she
was
engrossed
in
playing
with
another
little
girl
on
the
palace
steps
illustration
ozma
excuse
me
your
majesty
said
elephant
the
child
looked
up
from
her
game
and
smiled
at
the
pachyderm
hello
she
said
quietly
my
dear
queen
said
elephant
i
and
my
cohorts
are
from
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
it
is
situated
in
the
munchkin

we
are
proud
to
call
ourselves
your

thank
you
very
much
ozma
said
politely
do
you
want
to
play
with
us
i
er
well
i
suppose
at
some
point
i
could
be
persuaded
stammered
elephant
but
i
have
come
on
very
important
business
just
now
as
the
animals
watched
ozma
seemed
to
make
a
complete
transformation
she
remained
a
child
but
her
eyes
suddenly
grew
solemn
and
she
raised
herself
from
her
seat
on
the
steps
even
though
very
young
and
inexperienced
the
child
queen
took
on
an
appearance
of
regal
splendor
it
made
elephant
want
to
bow
down
before
her
and
this
he
promptly
did
it
was
fortunate
that
tweaty
could
fly
but
unfortunate
that
nibbles
could
not
tweaty
zoomed
into
the
air
without
mishap
as
soon
as
elephant
head
went
down
in
his
bow
nibbles
however
was
thrust
through
the
air
by
the
impact
of
elephant
exuberant
show
of
subjection
he
flew
toward
the
child
and
did
not
stop
until
he
became
caught
in
her
pocket
ozma
being
that
she
was
only
a
little
girl
after
all
began
to
scream
until
elephant
reached
into
the
pocket
with
his
trunk
and
retrieved
the
rodent
thank
you
ozma
said
composing
herself
when
i
was
a
little
boy
named
tip
i
have
probably
thought
that
very
funny
but
i
am
beginning
to
feel
like
ozma
again
this
is
who
i
am
truly
destined
to
be
now
tell
me
what
is
the
nature
of
your
call
elephant
and
the
others
quickly
explained
about
the
forest
monster
and
how
they
feared
for
their
lives
as
they
spoke
the
child
grew
more
and
more
solemn
it
is
hard
to
be
a
ruler
over
such
a
big
land
as
oz
spoke
the
child
after
she
had
heard
the
news
concerning
the
spider
creature
but
i
am
not
willing
to
allow
such
a
fiendish
creature
to
harm
any
of
my
subjects
i
do
not
know
of

but
i
will
do
all
in
my
power

assist
you

lurliné
leader
of
the
fairies
chapter
the
queen
of
oz
the
magic
of
oz
began
with
little
more
than
a
simple
wish
the
man
who
ruled
at
that
time
king
ozroar
was
not
a
very
happy
monarch
he
ruled
the
beautiful
land
but
he
had
no
magic
with
which
to
insure
the
happiness
of
the
people
sickening
fogs
would
envelop
the
land
from
time
to
time
and
the
area
was
never
very
prosperous
still
it
was
too
beautiful
to
go
overlooked
by
the
fairies
these
magical
beings
are
able
to
see
things
as
they
should
be
not
only
as
they
are
one
fairy
who
was
especially
interested
in
the
land
of
oz
was
a
leader
of
fairies
named
lurliné
lurliné
was
no
ordinary
fairy
ruler
though
she
had
especial
insight
into
the
things
that
made
beauty
what
it
is
it
was
her
keen
insight
that
once
brought
her
to
mount
olympus
this
legendary
mountain
has
long
been
said
to
be
the
home
of
many
ancient
gods
according
to
the
ozian
storytellers
who
still
today
will
sit
by
your
campfire
and
tell
you
a
tale
in
exchange
for
a
cup
of
tea
or
a
morsel
of
food
these
immortals
recognized
her
abilities
at
once
and
she
was
admitted
into
their
society
of
godhood
as
a
goddess
lurliné
was
able
to
gain
access
to
many
things
with
the
help
of
her
fairy
band
as
well
as
the
input
of
her
sister
fairy
polychrome
lurliné
was
able
to
give
the
land
of
oz
the
magical
enchantment
that
made
it
what
it
is
today
but
she
did
not
do
the
deed
without
a
few
pitfalls
among
the
things
that
lurliné
required
to
fulfill
the
spell
needs
were
apollo
own
sky
chariot
the
flying
horses
to
pull
it
through
the
air
kolé
essence
of
crystal
and
lillith
brazier
of
endless
flame
at
polychrome
suggestion
she
also
obtained
iris
jug
of
rainbow
unfortunately
lurliné
was
not
always
scrupulous
in
this
event
she
elected
to
take
the
various
magical
requirements
without
the
permission
of
the
various
deities
she
stole
into
their
chambers
at
night
as
they
lay
sleeping
and
took
the
elements
she
wished
she
then
went
together
with
her
fairy
band
and
performed
the
enchantment
over
oz
she
was
banished
from
mount
olympus
as
a
result
of
her
rash
action
but
supposing
the
legend
is
all
true
the
marvelous
land
of
oz
remains
as
a
glowing
tribute
to
the
powers
of
the
fairy
queen
lurliné
and
to
insure
its
longevity
lurliné
arranged
for
a
fairy
ruler
to
watch
over
the
country
she
had
created
of
course
the
ruler
would
have
to
be
a

she
would
be

transformed
her
into
a
boy
she
believed
that
no
one
would
ever
think
to
look
to
a
little
boy
to
find
the
fairy
princess
so
ozma
was
aptly
hidden
away
for
a
very
long
time
but
things
in
oz
do
have
a
way
of
working
out
for
the
best
after
diggs
left
the
country
ozma
was
found
and
restored
to
her
proper
being
she
had
aged
very
little
being
that
oz
folk
age
only
when
they
choose
to
and
little
ozma
had
just
been
given
her
rightful
place
on
the
royal
throne
most
of
this
history
of
course
was
unknown
to
elephant
and
his
companions
they
saw
only
the
fact
that
she
was
a
child
they
did
not
know
of
her
unique
experiences
at
all
if
they
had
they
have
surely
recognized
that
she
was
more
aware
of
human
needs
and
the
differences
there
connected
but
even
to
their
eyes
it
was
clear
that
this
child
was
very
special
they
had
every
hope
that
she
would
be
able
to
do
as
they
needed
done
to
rid
their
land
of
the
terrifying
forest
monster

tiger
caught
in
a
spiderweb
chapter
the
giant
spider
tiger
growled
as
he
watched
his
captor
wrap
him
in
the
strong
webbing
he
was
a
fairly
small
tiger
but
he
was
accustomed
to
being
larger
than
any
spider
he
had
ever
heard
of
this
spider
he
felt
certain
was
some
sort
of
a
freak
of
nature
perhaps
a
direct
result
of
the
constant
littering
or
maybe
a
military
experiment
gone
haywire
ahh
my
little
pussycat
laughed
the
creature
i
have
you
now
there
is
no
need
for
further
struggle
like
i
told
you
before
grumbled
tiger
i
am
not
a
lion
i
am
a
striped
tiger
ca
you
see
that
i
can
admit
that
you
do
not
look
like
what
i
had
in
mind
replied
the
spider
however
you
are
feline
in
nature
that
is
all
i
care
about
just
now
but
it
was
me
who
beheaded
you
i
am
innocent
perhaps
the
spider
seemed
unconcerned
perhaps
what
you
say
is
true
and
then
again
perhaps
you
lion
to
me
in
any
event
you
are
at
the
very
least
a
distant
cousin
to
that
animal
that
lopped
my
head
off
when
he
hears
that
you
are
in
my
clutches
he
be
here
but
this
is
a
small
rarely
traversed
forest
said
the
tiger
it
is
often
that
news
from
the
lunechien
forest
gets
out
to
the
rest
of
the
country
then
you
shall
stay
here
as
my
guest
grinned
the
spider
after
all
the
little
insect
has
been
satisfying
me
less
lately
i
had
been
using
her
sweet
charity
to
keep
myself
he
stalked
over
to
a
wall
on
the
far
side
of
the
cave
indicating
two
yellowing
papers
with
crudely
drawn
human
faces
on
them
he
turned
back
toward
his
bound
prisoner
these
are
pictures
i
drew
of
the
great
masters
they
created
me
and
gave
me
the
powers
i
possess
when
they
asked
me
to
devour
their
little
enemy
i
was
only
too
happy
to
comply
he
had
too
much
magic
in
him
however
i
was
sent
away
from
my
beloved
creators
tiger
thought
that
the
monster
was
about
to
cry
but
he
went
on
i
made
the
best
of
it
though
i
became
the
leader
of
a
lot
of
wild
animals
in
an
untamed
wood
oh
they
never
actually
called
me
that
but
they
feared
me
you
better
believe
it
they
were
scared
spitless
by
me
until
one
day
when
that
that
that
lion
came
along
and
used
my
head
as
if
it
were
a
baseball
but
i
get
even
now
little
friend
believe
you
me
i
will
find
that
lion
and
i
will
chomp
his
head
off
you
just
wait
and
see
if
i
do
he
turned
to
the
drawing
of
the
witch
of
the
east
i
will
avenge
myself
on
this
lion
for
us
both
he
said
crossing
himself
but
really
begged
tiger
i
have
no
argument
with
you
please
let
me
free
i
will
help
you
bag
your
not
a
bit
of
that
snarled
the
spider
i
have
better
plans
for
you
better
plans
most
definitely
as
i
was
saying
the
bug
no
longer
sufficient
for
my
needs
i
am
told
that
you
have
a
powerful
and
courageous
heart
bold
and
fearless
is
it
not
i
afraid
i
do
understand
your
if
i
use
your
heartfelt
emotions
which
seem
to
be
er
well
by
definition
if
i
can
do
that
i
can
remain
for
time
and
all
eternity
i
can
be
i
will
be
the
bravest
arachnid
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
next
my
little
chickadee
i
plan
to
capture
some
little
beasts
that
are
called
hootsey
and
lisa
is
it
owls
i
think
they
are
known
for
their
wisdom
and
kindness
to
their
fellow
ozites
i
care
nothing
for
their
kindness
of
course
my
power
comes
from
the
negative
uses
of
the
senses
but
i
plan
to
make
use
of
their
immense
knowledge
oh
yes
and
then
my
dear
little
tiger
then
i
shall
reach
out
to
my
definitive
prize
in
all
the
lunechien
forest
that
big
wrinkly
fellow
i
saw
not
too
long
ago
he
had
a
nose
like
a
garden
hose
but
my
little
bug
has
unwittingly
told
me
that
he
is
the
one
to
whom
the
forest
beasts
turn
when
they
have
problems
he
likes
to
solve
problems
and
has
a
phenomenal
knack
for
it
he
is
wise
beyond
his
years
and
his
emotions
encompass
all
the
land
he
is
also
one
of
the
strongest
and
most
bold
beasts
in
all
the
lunechien
territory
even
putting
the
tigers
like
you
to
shame
when
i
can
capture
this
elephant
i
will
be
i
will
be
almighty
i
will
be
superhuman
then
i
shall
be
able
to
take
on
the
beast
who
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
cowardly
lion
a
most
unfitting
moniker
would
you
say
for
a
fellow
who
swiped
off
my
head
while
i
was
asleep
one
day
you
never
get
away
with
this
roared
tiger
elephant
is
too
big
and
strong
to
be
beaten
by
any
spider
even
one
so
large
as
you
we
see
about
that
shortly
shorty
replied
the
spider
now
we
chapter
the
forest
monster
of
oz
meanwhile
word
of
the
monster
plans
for
tiger
had
reached
elephant
and
tweaty
and
nibbles
via
hootsey
and
lisa
the
trio
had
been
showing
ozma
the
cast
of
the
giant
footprint
when
the
owls
flew
in
with
the
news
ozma
was
astounded
that
such
a
beast
could
live
in
her
domain
without
her
being
aware
of
it
and
indeed
the
beast
had
kept
a
fairly
low
profile
until
recently
but
it
was
quite
obvious
that
a
power
struggle
was
now
going
on
the
beast
was
gradually
finding
out
that
he
could
grow
larger
and
stronger
at
the
expense
of
others
and
would
no
doubt
not
be
satisfied
until
he
was
so
large
and
powerful
that
every
living
creature
would
be
under
his
domain
why
even
ozma
herself
was
in
danger
the
owls
quickly
informed
her
that
the
beast
first
goal
was
to
capture
elephant
in
order
to
gain
the
super
strength
that
would
enable
him
to
attack
the
cowardly
lion
however
she
knew
he
had
to
absorb
tiger
power
and
courage
first
before
he
would
dream
of
attacking
elephant
it
was
quite
obvious
he
was
going
to
have
to
think
fast
before
tiger
became
a
mere
shell
of
his
old
self
hootsey
and
lisa
were
naturally
quite
concerned
for
their
own
welfare
they
did
not
want
their
wisdom
sucked
out
of
them
by
a
giant
spider
with
tendencies
one
has
to
live
a
long
time
and
learn
by
trial
and
error
before
one
can
truly
be
considered
wise
of
course
some
people
never
learn
they
make
the
same
mistakes
over
and
over
however
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
point
is
that
hootsey
and
lisa
were
in
as
much
danger
as
anyone
and
were
very
anxious
to
help
in
any
way
they
could
if
i
might
make
a
suggestion
said
hootsey
i
recently
came
upon
some
unusual
creatures
that
could
very
well
be
a
match
for
the
monster
of
course
everyone
was
all
ears
and
fell
silent
as
hootsey
began
to
talk
these
creatures
are
very
unusual
in
that
they
are
technically
made
of
glass
and
so
would
appear
to
be
very
fragile
but
when
they
open
their
mouths
they
are
a
most
ferocious
sight
to
behold
they
are
of
a
bulbous
shape
with
very
long
legs
that
can
move
at
the
speed
of
light
at
this
point
nibbles
intercepted
hootsey
graphic
description
these
animals
sound
most
interesting
but
they
do
sound
particularly
ferocious
oh
wait
responded
hootsey
i
have
told
you
the
best
part
their
mouths
are
filled
with
teeth
and
they
can
rip
any
animal
to
shreds
in
two
seconds
when
a
pack
of
them
attack
the
unfortunate
victim
never
even
knows
what
hit
him
it
over
that
fast
illustration
owl
describing
and
what
might
the
name
of
these
creatures
be
responded
elephant
well
answered
hootsey
two
important
factors
contribute
to
their
name
one
is
their
ability
to
light
their
bodies
up
at
night
brighter
than
a
hundred
glow
worms
the
second
is
when
they
open
their
mouths
and
expose
those
teeth
you
would
think
you
were
looking
at
a
tiger
anyone
want
to
guess
their
name
light
bulbs
everyone
responded
in
unison
they
all
began
to
feel
a
little
better
to
know
that
perhaps
the
dreadful
may
not
be
so
formidable
after
all
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
how
he
could
possibly
stand
up
to
a
ferocious
pack
of
light
bulbs
of
course
the
next
thing
that
must
be
done
would
be
to
negotiate
with
the
light
bulbs
and
see
if
they
would
be
willing
to
take
on
the
monster
the
little
group
was
so
engrossed
in
mulling
this
over
that
they
did
not
notice
a
new
visitor
in
their
midst
it
was
tweaty
who
first
noticed
him
and
nudged
nibbles
in
the
ribs
nibbles
looked
up
to
observe
the
little
chap
that
he
had
ever
set
eyes
on
he
was
a
sort
of
miniature
fred
flintstone
short
and
pudgy
but
he
had
a
nose
to
beat
all
noses
it
was
that
it
was
long
or
funny
shaped
or
anything
it
was
just
big
and
i
really
mean
big
anyway
when
tweaty
poked
nibbles
in
the
ribs
it
was
a
pretty
hard
poke
and
nibbles
let
out
quite
a
yell
everyone
turned
to
look
and
saw
the
stranger
excuse
me
said
the
stranger
i
did
mean
to
intrude
but
i
saw
everyone
here
having
a
meeting
and
i
did
want
to
interrupt
however
since
i
now
have
your
undivided
attention
i
feel
to
convey
the
reason
for
my
being
here
in
the
hopes
that
you
will
not
consider
it
an
intrusion
on
your
privacy
well
he
is
certainly
polite
commented
hootsey
it
is
my
considered
opinion
that
we
should
hear
what
he
has
to
say
by
all
means
everyone
said
nodding
in
unison
well
my
mission
is
really
with
queen
ozma
you
see
my
people
have
encountered
some
border
skirmishes
with
our
neighbors
to
the
north
and
we
were
hoping
that
queen
ozma
could
use
her
good
offices
and
apply
her
diplomatic
powers
of
persuasion
to
encourage
them
to
retreat
back
into
their
own
territory
you
see
they
are
very
aggressive
in
nature
whereas
we
are
a
very
passive
people
might
i
ask
if
they
have
made
any
formal
declaration
of
hostilities
asked
the
queen
in
her
best
adult
voice
well
no
not
exactly
responded
the
little
chap
perhaps
the
best
way
of
clarifying
the
situation
would
be
for
me
to
read
this
copy
of
a
recent
speech
our
president
gave
to
our
parliamentary
congress
with
that
he
pulled
out
a
manuscript
from
his
coat
pocket
with
a
flourish
and
began
to
read
and
gentlemen
i
have
called
this
emergency
session
of
the
five
hundredth
and
eighteenth
parliamentary
congress
to
inform
you
of
some
very
disturbing
developments
along
our
northern
border
as
president
of
the
sniffer
nation
i
need
not
remind
you
of
the
delicate
nature
of
our
highly
sensitive
olfactory
organs
our
noses
and
would
you
believe
that
our
friendly
northern
neighbors
the
stinkfoots
have
recently
seen
fit
to
ignore
all
previous
treaties
and
sense
of
common
decency
they
have
caused
great
distress
among
our
border
residents
by
not
only
building
new
residential
dwellings
right
smack
up
against
the
border
but
have
blatantly
crossed
the
border
in
ever
increasing
numbers
and
brazenly
thumbed
their
ridiculously
small
noses
at
sniffer
citizens
who
were
unfortunate
enough
to
cross
their
paths
they
have
also
been
observed
taking
soil
samples
from
our
rich
bottom
land
the
reasons
for
this
are
now
known
to
us
you
will
be
shocked
to
the
core
when
i
reveal
this
to
you
in
a
moment
in
the
meantime
many
of
our
border
residents
have
become
so
overwhelmed
and
nauseated
by
the
smell
of
the
stinkfoots
that
they
have
moved
lock
stock
and
barrel
to
the
city
i
immediately
dashed
off
a
letter
of
protest
to
the
stinkfoot
president
demanding
an
immediate
withdrawal
to
the
previously
negotiated
line
of
demarcation
two
miles
north
of
the
border
i
do
not
wish
to
alarm
our
citizens
to
the
point
of
panic
but
i
shall
now
read
to
you
their
president
reply
president
humongous
schnozzle
distinguished
members
of
the
five
hundredth
and
eighteenth
parliamentary
congress
of
the
sniffer
nation
and
to
all
of
the
humble
citizens
of
your
fair
land
let
me
apologize
for
not
entering
into
new
negotiations
regarding
our
present
expansion
but
due
to
a
severe
blight
on
our
stinkweed
crop
which
as
you
know
is
our
staple
diet
our
people
are
becoming
severely
malnourished
i
sure
that
you
are
all
well
aware
that
we
are
greatly
dependent
on
the
stinkweed
plant
for
many
purposes
the
least
of
which
is
the
manufacture
of
stinkweed
pills
which
we
all
partake
of
religiously
in
order
to
maintain
that
rich
aroma
that
permeates
our
bodies
but
which
mainly
radiates
from
the
area
of
our
feet
as
you
know
our
olfactory
senses
are
virtually
nonexistent
but
we
are
aware
of
a
slight
essence
of
this
aroma
which
we
find
most
pleasing
unfortunately
for
others
who
might
stray
across
our
borders
the
smell
overpowers
them
in
seconds
rendering
any
potential
invader
helpless
now
as
a
result
of
the
factors
i
have
just
presented
to
you
we
find
your
bottom
land
by
our
northern
borders
to
be
extremely
rich
in
nutrients
that
the
stinkweed
plant
needs
to
flourish
and
preliminary
experimental
results
indicate
that
stinkweed
plants
grown
in
this
environment
are
completely
immune
to
the
blight
that
is
wiping
out
our
crop
therefore
we
have
no
option
but
to
take
as
much
of
your
land
as
will
insure
the
very
survival
of
the
proud
nation
that
we
are
that
is
why
we
did
not
inform
you
formally
or
informally
the
matter
is
simply
not
negotiable
mcfoot
president
past
present
and
future
of
stinkfootland
it
is
not
our
fault
that
the
sniffer
people
have
such
big
noses
that
their
sense
of
smell
is
ultra
sensitive
to
our
presence
the
little
group
had
fallen
silent
you
know
said
elephant
to
ozma
we
are
greatly
sympathetic
to
their
predicament
however
the
situation
with
the
stinkfoots
and
the
sniffers
is
diverting
us
from
our
real
problem
which
is
that
huge
furry
ugly
filthy
putrid
monstrosity
who
calls
himself
a
spider
that
very
true
said
ozma
but
remember
we
have
to
negotiate
with
the
light
bulbs
before
we
can
do
anything
in
the
meantime
the
president
of
the
sniffer
nation
has
asked
our
help
and
we
simply
can
not
refuse
he
and
his
people
are
in
a
real
bind
i
be
in
a
real
bind
if
that
monster
attacks
me
snapped
elephant
i
be
bound
up
in
his
giant
web
and
devoured
to
death
now
do
you
worry
ozma
replied
reaching
up
to
pat
trunk
we
wo
let
anything
happen
to
you
her
answer
must
have
satisfied
elephant
because
he
wrapped
his
trunk
around
her
waist
and
hoisted
her
up
to
his
back
then
he
walked
down
to
the
stream
and
took
a
long
drink
as
they
returned
to
join
the
group
hootsey
was
clearing
his
throat
and
proceeded
to
speak
with
pure
wisdom
dripping
from
every
word
i
have
been
thinking
before
he
could
continue
lisa
interrupted
him
i
can
see
that
been
thinking
because
smoke
is
coming
out
of
your
ears
of
course
she
had
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
when
she
said
this
but
hootsey
did
not
see
the
humor
of
it
well
that
very
funny
ha
ha
he
said
dryly
i
dying
of
laughter
ho
ho
ho
after
he
finished
glaring
at
lisa
he
continued
so
anyway
as
i
was
saying
again
glaring
at
lisa
i
was
so
rudely
interrupted
there
is
great
diversity
in
oz
i
mean
there
are
so
many
different
kinds
of
people
yet
for
the
most
part
we
all
get
along
fairly
well
oh
we
have
our
differences
of
opinion
no
question
about
it
but
we
seem
to
resolve
them
without
too
much
upheaval
well
most
of
the
time
anyway
the
point
is
at
that
tweaty
interrupted
i
can
see
immediately
that
you
have
never
been
to
chilepepperland
and
where
pray
tell
is
chilepepperland
enquired
hootsey
with
a
hint
of
cynicism
and
why
have
i
never
heard
of
it
perhaps
you
never
heard
of
it
because
you
too
busy
trying
to
think
of
wise
things
to
say
interrupted
nibbles
after
all
you
have
a
reputation
to
uphold
hootsey
could
not
be
sure
if
nibbles
was
being
a
smart
alec
or
was
just
paying
him
a
complement
chilepepperland
is
beyond
the
great
desert
answered
tweaty
in
a
very
remote
region
which
is
surrounded
by
impenetrable
terrain
composed
of
jagged
rocks
there
is
only
one
narrow
passageway
which
twists
and
turns
every
which
way
through
the
rocks
the
sides
of
the
passageway
are
quite
sheer
if
you
were
looking
down
from
above
it
would
just
seem
like
a
chasm
because
you
can
not
see
the
path
at
the
bottom
besides
the
road
disappears
in
places
where
it
goes
under
the
rocks
the
entrance
is
completely
hidden
by
prickly
pear
bushes
which
are
plentiful
in
the
region
that
is
why
no
one
has
ever
heard
of
chilepepperland
because
it
is
basically
cut
off
from
civilization
how
did
you
discover
it
elephant
asked
with
genuine
curiosity
well
continued
tweaty
i
happened
to
be
flying
over
the
area
one
day
and
spotted
a
group
of
green
chilepeppers
having
a
picnic
they
invited
me
to
lunch
and
told
me
all
about
their
turbulent
history
it
seems
that
chilepepperland
was
first
occupied
by
several
tribes
of
red
chilepeppers
who
were
for
the
most
part
oh
they
had
occasional
small
skirmishes
among
themselves
but
they
lived
in
relative
harmony
for
many
many
years
living
off
the
land
which
they
treated
with
great
reverence
because
it
provided
all
their
food
they
also
had
great
respect
for
the
animal
kingdom
they
were
never
wasteful
giving
constant
thanks
to
the
great
spirit
who
they
believed
watched
over
them
and
provided
for
them
abundantly
they
believed
in
sharing
their
bounty
with
one
another
and
this
they
did
frequently
with
great
ceremony
then
one
fateful
day
the
first
group
of
yellow
chilepeppers
arrived
from
a
foreign
shore
at
first
there
was
a
mutual
understanding
between
the
newcomers
and
the
indigenous
people
the
red
chilepeppers
were
very
helpful
in
assisting
the
newcomers
to
adapt
to
their
new
surroundings
in
return
they
were
given
trinkets
that
sparkled
such
as
colored
glass
beads
hand
mirrors
and
such
the
like
of
which
they
never
set
eyes
on
before
the
red
chilepeppers
were
an
innocent
people
really
quite
primitive
compared
to
the
sophisticated
civilized
newcomers
who
incidentally
were
very
quick
to
take
advantage
of
the
childlike
trust
the
red
chilepeppers
displayed
in
their
early
contacts
they
moved
quickly
to
take
full
advantage
of
these
simple
trustful
souls
and
as
more
and
more
yellow
chilepeppers
arrived
they
moved
across
the
country
taking
whatever
land
they
needed
without
any
regard
for
the
previous
occupants
this
lead
to
much
fighting
and
eventual
total
conquest
of
the
red
chilepeppers
who
were
forced
to
give
up
their
beautiful
lands
and
moved
to
less
desirable
areas
this
broke
their
spirit
for
they
were
once
a
very
proud
people
roaming
at
will
the
vast
prairies
and
forests
and
to
this
day
they
remain
citizens
really
never
able
to
assimilate
into
the
world
of
the
yellow
chilepeppers
nor
ever
able
to
return
to
the
total
freedom
they
once
knew
that
has
to
be
the
saddest
story
i
ever
heard
said
elephant
those
yellow
chilepeppers
are
just
rotten
dogs
how
could
they
treat
their
fellow
chilepeppers
that
way
just
because
they
were
red
instead
of
yellow
i
assume
that
they
were
uncomfortable
with
people
who
they
considered
answered
ozma
also
they
wanted
the
best
land
for
themselves
anyway
that
not
all
continued
tweaty
after
they
took
those
lush
lands
away
from
the
rightful
owners
they
desecrated
much
of
it
over
the
years
seeing
it
only
as
something
to
take
from
and
to
pour
harsh
chemicals
into
for
various
reasons
of
their
own
the
red
chilepeppers
had
always
blessed
the
land
given
it
thanks
for
its
bounty
and
replenished
it
when
they
took
from
it
yet
the
yellow
chilepeppers
considered
them
primitive
and
savage
and
that
still
not
all
the
green
chilepeppers
went
on
to
tell
me
about
the
treatment
that
received
at
the
hands
of
the
yellow
chilepeppers
it
seems
that
they
also
lived
in
a
land
of
their
own
far
away
across
the
nonestic
ocean
one
day
a
group
of
yellow
chilepeppers
who
were
visiting
the
area
in
their
ship
came
ashore
and
captured
some
of
them
and
took
them
back
to
chilepepperland
and
sold
them
to
plantation
owners
in
the
southern
part
of
chilepepperland
oh
come
on
said
nibbles
who
had
been
very
silent
all
this
time
you
ca
sell
people
in
those
days
you
could
tweaty
responded
at
least
according
to
the
green
chilepeppers
i
talked
to
they
not
only
sold
the
people
they
captured
as
slaves
but
they
went
back
again
and
again
to
capture
more
green
chilepeppers
and
sold
them
too
and
by
the
way
a
lot
of
the
green
chilepeppers
died
in
the
terrible
voyage
en
route
but
how
could
the
leaders
of
the
yellow
chilepeppers
allow
this
to
happen
asked
ozma
i
would
never
allow
even
an
unkind
remark
to
pass
between
them
if
i
were
their
leader
and
i
would
have
made
the
yellow
chilepeppers
take
the
green
chilepeppers
back
to
their
own
people
immediately
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
continued
tweaty
the
yellow
leader
lived
in
the
north
and
he
thought
very
poorly
of
this
arrangement
a
lot
of
other
people
agreed
with
him
and
he
abolished
slavery
forever
from
the
land
but
it
caused
the
yellow
chilepeppers
to
fight
among
themselves
and
to
this
day
some
yellow
chilepeppers
still
do
not
consider
the
green
chilepeppers
to
be
equal
in
status
to
themselves
and
can
be
quite
discriminating
in
their
treatment
of
them
that
is
when
they
can
get
away
with
it
they
even
confine
them
economically
and
socially
to
areas
that
are
less
desirable
to
live
quite
naturally
this
causes
great
resentment
among
many
of
the
green
chilepeppers
and
sometimes
their
anger
is
unleashed
in
unfortunate
ways
this
in
turn
causes
an
even
greater
chasm
between
the
two
groups
how
terrible
elephant
said
chilepepperland
sounds
like
a
horrible
place
to
live
i
hope
i
never
even
have
to
visit
there
it
sounds
to
me
said
ozma
that
if
every
single
chilepepper
who
lives
in
chilepepperland
really
wanted
to
they
could
live
in
peace
and
love
and
harmony
alongside
each
other
forever
and
ever
and
then
it
would
be
a
perfectly
wonderful
place
to
live
the
problem
as
i
see
it
said
hootsey
looking
as
wise
as
he
could
is
that
for
every
chilepepper
of
whatever
color
whose
heart
is
filled
with
love
and
kindness
for
his
fellows
there
are
probably
several
who
can
not
generate
those
feelings
within
themselves
so
i
predict
that
the
unfortunate
state
of
affairs
in
that
dark
land
will
continue
for
quite
some
time
to
come
it
a
very
negative
prognosis
i
know
but
the
accumulated
wisdom
i
have
acquired
over
many
years
tells
me
that
this
is
so
i
know
one
thing
said
lisa
the
people
who
live
in
the
land
where
dorothy
comes
from
are
much
too
intelligent
to
allow
such
foolishness
to
exist
there
the
other
members
of
the
little
group
turned
to
each
other
knowingly
and
slowly
shook
their
heads
for
they
knew
that
the
unfortunate
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
the
land
where
dorothy
came
from
had
had
a
similar
history
in
fact
even
as
i
write
these
words
there
are
people
in
the
mortal
lands
who
have
lost
their
homes
and
all
of
their
worldly
possessions
and
many
their
lives
simply
because
they
had
the
misfortune
to
be
born
different
in
some
way
than
their
neighbors
everyone
became
very
quiet
as
he
assimilated
all
that
had
been
said
ozma
spoke
first
i
would
like
to
read
if
i
may
a
poem
from
a
little
book
given
to
me
by
a
dear
friend
i
was
reminded
of
this
poem
when
tweaty
spoke
of
the
difficulties
the
green
chilepepper
people
encountered
the
poem
was
written
by
a
mortal
human
named
william
blake
it
is
called
little
black
mother
bore
me
in
the
southern
wild
and
i
am
black
but
o
my
soul
is
white
white
as
an
angel
is
the
english
child
but
i
am
black
as
if
bereaved
of
light
my
mother
taught
me
underneath
a
tree
and
sitting
down
before
the
heat
of
the
day
she
took
me
on
her
lap
and
kissed
me
and
pointing
to
the
east
began
to
say
look
on
the
rising
sun
there
god
does
live
and
gives
his
light
and
gives
his
heat
away
and
flowers
and
trees
and
beasts
and
men
receive
comfort
in
the
morning
joy
in
the
noonday
and
we
are
put
on
earth
a
little
space
that
we
may
learn
to
bear
the
beams
of
love
and
these
black
bodies
and
this
sunburnt
face
are
but
a
cloud
and
like
a
shady
grove
for
when
our
souls
have
learned
the
heat
to
bear
the
cloud
will
vanish
we
shall
hear
his
voice
saying
out
from
the
grove
my
love
and
care
and
round
my
golden
tent
like
lambs
rejoice
thus
did
my
mother
say
and
kissed
me
and
thus
i
say
to
the
little
english
boy
when
i
from
black
and
he
from
white
cloud
free
and
round
the
tent
of
god
like
lambs
we
joy
i
shade
him
from
the
heat
he
can
bear
to
lean
in
joy
upon
our
father
knee
and
then
i
stand
and
stroke
his
silver
hair
and
be
like
him
and
he
will
then
love
by
the
time
ozma
had
read
the
last
line
tears
were
streaming
down
everyone
face
that
is
the
most
beautiful
poem
i
have
ever
heard
elephant
sobbed
as
tweaty
dabbed
his
eyes
with
a
tailfeather
and
so
very
sad
that
it
will
take
so
long
for
true
love
to
exist
between
all
peoples
only
when
they
realize
that
in
the
ultimate
sense
there
is
no
difference
between
them
the
story
of
the
chilepeppers
and
the
poem
by
william
blake
left
everyone
in
a
very
somber
mood
but
time
was
not
standing
still
and
you
can
be
sure
that
that
old
was
not
letting
any
grass
grow
under
his
feet
even
now
he
was
no
doubt
growing
stronger
by
the
minute
by
sucking
strength
and
courage
out
of
any
victim
who
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
be
caught
in
his
deadly
web
we
must
be
on
our
way
ozma
said
shivering
slightly
elephant
why
do
we
all
ride
on
you
and
we
talk
as
we
go
along
and
plan
our
strategy
good
idea
elephant
answered
picking
ozma
up
again
meanwhile
tweaty
and
the
owls
flew
up
and
perched
on
elephant
head
elephant
then
lowered
his
trunk
to
allow
nibbles
to
jump
aboard
and
be
lifted
up
behind
ozma
okay
every
one
shouted
elephant
as
he
raised
his
trunk
high
in
the
air
and
let
out
a
great
trump
which
just
about
blew
everyone
off
his
back
he
then
proceeded
to
waddle
down
the
road
making
trumping
sounds
that
sounded
suspiciously
like
a
trombone
playing
the
bass
part
to
the
saints
go
marching
in
fact
pretty
soon
everyone
was
singing
along
when
the
saints
go
mar
chin
in
when
the
saints
go
marchin
in
lord
i
want
to
be
in
that
number
when
the
saints
go
marchin
in
illustration
sniffer
and
stinkfoot
arguing
chapter
the
journey
toward
the
sniffer
nation
as
i
see
it
said
lisa
as
they
traveled
along
there
is
at
least
one
major
difference
between
the
problems
in
the
sniffer
nation
and
the
problems
of
chilepepperland
the
chilepeppers
so
far
as
i
can
determine
are
different
from
one
another
only
in
their
viewpoints
some
may
have
had
a
better
education
than
others
but
all
were
born
essentially
equal
on
the
other
hand
even
if
they
were
born
equal
the
sniffer
citizens
have
a
real
physical
reason
for
their
disagreement
with
the
stinkfoots
if
you
will
forgive
my
saying
so
i
can
not
believe
that
either
group
is
necessarily
better
or
more
important
than
the
other
it
just
that
they
are
physically
unable
to
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
it
replied
the
sniffer
citizen
i
have
to
agree
after
all
the
stinkfoot
people
used
to
get
along
fine
with
my
people
so
long
as
we
kept
our
distance
from
one
another
now
that
the
stinkfoots
are
infringing
on
our
territory
we
are
forced
to
take
action
against
them
despite
our
former
friendship
but
there
simply
is
no
alternative
they
are
taking
away
our
homeland
and
pushing
us
away
there
is
no
other
option
but
to
push
them
back
it
is
a
real
problem
when
one
specie
overcrowds
its
territory
added
hootsey
it
must
pave
away
all
other
life
forms
to
further
supply
its
own
needs
but
no
one
has
the
right
to
crowd
out
what
nature
has
already
established
said
elephant
just
imagine
the
chaos
it
would
create
if
say
the
human
race
were
to
become
so
plentiful
that
it
was
leveling
rain
forests
and
wiping
out
all
other
forms
of
life
to
make
room
for
itself
that
would
be
terrible
agreed
hootsey
and
it
is
exactly
what
the
stinkfoots
are
doing
once
they
have
pushed
the
sniffers
into
either
isolation
or
extinction
they
may
continue
to
outgrow
the
territory
they
occupy
and
move
into
other
regions
where
they
will
do
even
more
damage
they
have
to
be
stopped
at
any
cost
said
the
sniffer
man
no
said
ozma
not
at
any
cost
even
though
they
are
doing
bad
they
are
still
counted
among
my
subjects
they
are
not
enemies
to
oz
and
i
will
not
have
them
entirely
devastated
our
plan
has
to
be
fair
to
both
sides
not
just
one
as
we
have
said
neither
side
is
better
than
the
other
you
yourself
agreed
we
ca
allow
either
race
to
be
lost
in
favor
of
the
other
that
would
upset
the
balance
of
nature
but
how
else
can
we
stop
them
from
expanding
to
wherever
they
like
asked
the
sniffer
citizen
there
has
to
be
a
fair
way
to
settle
the
dispute
replied
the
little
queen
and
it
is
up
to
us
to
find
it
what
if
we
forbade
them
from
eating
any
more
stinkweeds
suggested
nibbles
that
way
they
would
smell
so
bad
and
the
sniffers
would
have
no
further
trouble
with
them
also
they
would
no
longer
need
to
be
living
in
an
area
that
would
help
the
stinkweeds
grow
you
heard
the
letter
answered
lisa
they
wo
agree
to
that
they
like
the
smell
that
they
get
from
the
weeds
and
they
believe
it
will
prevent
anyone
attacking
them
they
would
never
go
along
with
that
plan
we
almost
there
sighed
the
sniffer
citizen
but
we
are
no
closer
to
an
agreement
what
can
we
do
i
intend
to
speak
with
your
president
replied
ozma
and
i
will
also
meet
with
the
stinkfoot
president
ozma
and
the
lunechien
party
of
five
was
greeted
at
the
border
of
the
sniffer
nation
by
president
humongous
schnozzle
himself
indeed
he
must
have
had
the
largest
nose
that
ozma
had
ever
seen
it
was
longer
than
that
of
elephant
probisquous
he
said
joyfully
you
back
and
you
have
brought
an
army
with
you
hello
president
said
the
sniffer
messenger
this
is
queen
ozma
of
oz
and
with
her
are
elephant
lisa
hootsey
tweaty
and
nibbles
from
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
i
have
told
them
of
our
plight
and
they
have
come
to
try
and
help
and
not
a
moment
too
soon
said
president
schnozzle
the
stinkfoots
have
sent
me
another
letter
this
time
they
are
threatening
to
burn
down
our
village
if
we
do
not
surrender
immediately
i
hope
that
your
small
army
is
prepared
to
stand
up
to
them
i
did
not
come
to
fight
said
ozma
with
a
firmness
that
surprised
even
her
i
want
to
see
the
two
sides
come
to
an
arrangement
if
that
is
not
possible
we
may
then
have
to
resort
to
stronger
measures
i
afraid
that
the
stinkfoots
are
beyond
reasoning
sighed
president
schnozzle
the
only
recourse
we
have
is
to
fight
fire
with
fire
ozma
could
see
that
the
sniffer
president
was
not
going
to
deviate
from
his
present
frame
of
mind
without
a
struggle
i
do
understand
your
position
and
i
sympathize
with
your
feelings
she
said
however
before
anyone
does
anything
rash
i
wish
to
speak
to
president
mcfoot
then
i
suggest
that
you
hold
your
nose
replied
schnozzle
otherwise
you
be
overwhelmed
by
the
stench
and
probably
pass
out
i
take
that
chance
said
the
little
queen
just
give
me
an
hour
to
talk
to
mcfoot
before
you
start
any
uprising
i
will
give
you
all
the
time
you
want
replied
the
sniffer
president
at
least
from
my
side
but
if
those
stinkers
start
anything
better
believe
that
i
will
not
sit
doggo
and
let
them
destroy
our
homes
fair
enough
said
ozma
she
then
followed
probisquous
to
the
edge
of
the
stinkfoot
nation
i
ca
take
you
any
further
he
said
my
eyes
are
already
starting
to
water
i
hope
you
can
handle
the
stinkiness
from
this
point
onward
it
gets
worse
the
closer
you
come
to
those
guys
ozma
thanked
him
and
went
on
her
way
indeed
the
smell
was
a
potent
one
she
could
see
why
it
would
ward
off
any
potential
attackers
she
tried
to
hold
her
breath
but
that
was
not
something
she
could
do
indefinitely
she
tried
holding
her
nose
and
breathing
with
her
mouth
but
that
was
hardly
a
dignified
pose
for
the
queen
of
all
oz
when
the
stench
became
absolutely
unbearable
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
a
little
boy
who
sported
the
tiniest
nose
she
could
have
imagined
it
was
about
the
same
size
as
that
of
a
ladybug
his
feet
on
the
other
hand
were
enormous
who
are
you
asked
the
lad
i
amb
queen
ozba
of
oz
she
said
with
some
difficulty
i
amb
here
to
visit
with
president
stinky
mcfoot
of
the
stinkfoot
nation
i
thought
your
nose
was
too
small
to
make
you
a
sniffer
he
said
but
it
is
sure
a
lot
bigger
than
any
stinkfoot
hey
why
are
you
holding
it
like
that
afraid
that
having
a
hard
time
dealing
with
the
sbell
of
the
stinkweeds
she
explained
not
wanting
to
hurt
the
boy
feelings
by
mentioning
his
feet
which
ozma
felt
certain
were
the
real
source
of
the
offensive
smell
she
believed
that
it
would
be
better
to
avoid
any
statement
that
might
be
taken
as
a
gesture
of
insult
the
stinkweeds
replied
the
boy
but
they
are
delicious
they
are
our
primary
food
this
was
not
going
very
well
and
the
little
queen
was
already
feeling
nauseated
by
the
stench
she
would
not
be
able
to
take
much
time
explaining
her
situation
before
she
became
physically
ill
this
proposed
a
problem
as
she
had
never
known
illness
to
exist
in
oz
still
it
was
a
matter
that
would
require
a
bit
of
research
i
bust
see
your
president
she
sniffled
uneasily
can
you
take
be
to
himb
of
course
said
the
boy
simply
taking
a
handful
of
the
stinkweeds
and
eating
it
i
can
take
you
to
his
mansion
anyway
i
do
know
if
want
to
talk
he
is
preparing
to
fight
the
sniffers
for
control
of
the
fertile
lands
and
is
very
busy
with
that
right
now
that
just
the
thing
said
ozma
i
need
to
discuss
that
batter
with
himb
well
said
the
boy
you
are
the
queen
follow
me
ozma
followed
the
lad
as
quickly
as
she
could
under
the
circumstances
the
smell
only
grew
more
pungent
with
each
step
it
was
overpowering
but
she
knew
that
she
had
to
help
the
two
rivals
to
come
to
an
arrangement
quickly
as
the
forest
monster
could
be
doing
nearly
anything
at
this
point
and
she
was
losing
valuable
time
she
wished
that
she
had
sent
the
forest
animals
on
to
speak
to
the
light
bulbs
without
her
but
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
such
an
act
might
well
have
endangered
her
new
friends
if
she
were
not
with
the
animals
the
light
bulbs
might
well
have
attacked
them
no
this
was
all
she
could
do
she
only
hoped
that
she
had
not
chosen
the
wrong
skirmish
to
settle
first
when
she
came
to
the
mansion
of
president
stinky
mcfoot
she
saw
that
it
was
expansive
it
was
a
good
sixteen
acres
wide
and
had
more
rooms
than
any
one
man
could
possibly
make
use
of
she
hurriedly
knocked
on
the
heavy
oak
door
her
knock
was
answered
by
a
stinkfoot
who
was
dressed
as
a
butler
yes
he
said
to
her
i
amb
queen
ozba
of
oz
she
explained
i
amb
here
to
speak
to
the
president
queen
ozba
of
oz
replied
the
butler
but
you
are
just
a
child
how
can
you
be
the
queen
of
anything
except
possibly
a
toy
box
i
amb
queen
ozba
she
said
i
amb
serious
i
bean
it
okay
chuckled
the
stinkfoot
i
play
along
for
a
moment
if
you
are
the
queen
of
oz
what
is
it
you
wish
to
speak
to
president
mcfoot
about
he
is
planning
a
war
with
the
sniffer
nation
said
the
queen
i
want
to
try
to
find
a
better
way
for
your
people
to
solve
your
differences
that
is
very
touching
laughed
the
butler
but
if
you
were
really
the
queen
of
oz
you
would
surely
know
that
the
matter
is
already
settled
the
will
have
to
let
us
have
the
land
we
need
to
survive
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
now
go
home
little
girl
we
have
a
lot
to
attend
to
and
there
really
is
any
time
for
your
games
but
i
amb
really
the
queen
objected
she
yes
said
the
butler
and
i
am
charles
dickens
my
wife
is
the
queen
of
england
now
do
run
along
he
shut
the
door
before
ozma
had
a
chance
to
say
anything
more
this
is
not
going
at
all
as
i
planned
sighed
ozma
but
the
pungent
odor
was
already
more
than
she
could
take
and
she
knew
that
she
must
get
to
some
fresh
air
immediately
if
she
was
to
be
of
any
practical
use
to
either
the
sniffers
or
the
denizens
of
the
lunechien
forest
dejectedly
she
returned
to
the
sniffer
nation
she
was
gasping
for
air
by
the
time
she
arrived
there
and
so
she
breathed
in
several
lungfuls
of
the
cleaner
purer
stuff
it
was
a
treat
that
she
was
grateful
for
so
what
did
stinky
mcstink
have
to
say
president
schnozzle
asked
ozma
upon
her
return
i
did
not
get
in
to
see
mcfoot
said
ozma
sourly
but
i
sure
did
get
a
noseful
of
your
immediate
problem
our
immediate
problem
is
the
fact
that
a
bunch
of
people
with
are
planning
to
attack
and
burn
our
village
to
the
ground
i
am
sorry
your
majesty
but
we
are
left
with
no
other
recourse
but
to
go
to
war
with
them
and
destroy
them
all
before
they
do
it
to
us
surely
you
can
see
that
they
are
unreasonable
and
unkind
and
well
a
bunch
of
other
words
that
start
with
we
ca
allow
them
to
us
if
we
can
help
it
and
we
sniffers
are
a
proud
people
who
will
not
give
in
without
a
fight
president
schnozzle
sighed
ozma
i
am
not
trying
to
belittle
you
or
your
pride
i
just
do
think
that
resorting
to
violence
is
the
way
to
deal
with
any
situation
it
only
leads
to
misery
for
both
sides
not
if
we
win
replied
the
president
in
times
of
war
said
lisa
there
are
no
winners
the
had
stayed
back
with
the
four
lunechien
animals
at
the
sniffer
modest
home
and
was
also
a
little
disappointed
at
ozma
failure
to
speak
to
the
stinkfoot
leader
so
much
had
been
riding
on
this
meeting
but
ozma
had
not
gotten
in
to
see
him
and
the
simple
fact
remained
that
they
were
no
closer
to
a
solution
than
they
had
been
before
maybe
we
need
those
light
bulbs
right
here
suggested
nibbles
then
the
stinkfoots
would
be
too
scared
to
start
a
fight
i
doubt
it
reasoned
president
schnozzle
i
not
even
sure
that
any
light
bulbs
could
handle
the
stinky
smell
of
those
buzzards
maybe
not
said
hootsey
but
it
is
an
idea
what
if
we
were
to
scare
the
stinkfoots
back
into
their
own
territory
that
may
be
possible
said
ozma
it
looked
to
me
like
they
had
no
problem
of
overpopulation
it
was
really
just
their
desire
to
grow
more
stinkweeds
and
their
incapability
to
do
so
in
their
soil
that
right
said
lisa
but
no
soil
can
go
indefinitely
growing
the
same
crop
anyone
who
lives
in
the
forest
knows
that
and
even
the
munchkin
farmers
rotate
their
crops
to
keep
their
soil
in
balance
rotate
it
scoffed
the
sniffer
president
you
mean
like
a
phonograph
record
on
a
turntable
no
replied
lisa
i
mean
that
if
say
a
farmer
plants
carrots
in
his
fields
this
year
he
will
plant
something
totally
different
next
year
this
way
the
nutrients
in
the
soil
stay
in
balance
and
can
be
used
to
raise
more
carrots
some
other
year
it
really
very
simple
it
kind
of
like
replenishing
with
one
crop
what
was
diminutized
by
another
so
you
think
that
if
the
stinkfoots
were
to
grow
carrots
instead
of
stinkweeds
for
a
year
they
could
go
back
to
stinkweeds
next
year
said
the
president
uncertainly
i
say
more
than
likely
agreed
lisa
but
put
in
hootsey
the
stinkfoots
ca
live
without
their
stinkweed
or
they
refuse
to
in
any
event
maybe
we
have
a
solution
grinned
ozma
but
we
do
said
hootsey
they
will
refuse
to
give
up
their
stinkweeds
you
know
it
true
not
if
they
can
have
them
said
ozma
listen
president
schnozzle
what
would
you
think
of
letting
the
stinkfoots
use
your
land
to
grow
their
food
here
this
year
while
the
sniffer
farmers
use
the
stinkfoot
nation
to
grow
anything
that
they
want
to
eat
you
can
simply
switch
territories
every
year
and
the
rotation
of
crops
will
keep
both
of
your
soils
fertile
the
sniffer
president
sat
down
in
a
wooden
chair
he
was
obviously
deep
in
thought
you
know
he
said
after
a
time
i
think
you
have
something
there
if
we
can
only
state
this
plan
to
the
stinkfoots
sure
it
would
work
i
am
beginning
to
recall
that
even
our
own
farmers
have
spoken
about
this
rotation
of
crops
on
at
least
one
occasion
and
i
bet
that
the
stinkweeds
would
have
made
the
soil
over
there
ideal
for
our
dietary
staples
more
than
likely
said
lisa
wisely
this
is
all
very
nice
said
elephant
but
how
are
we
to
propose
this
idea
to
a
people
who
is
as
unwilling
to
listen
as
a
deaf
we
have
got
to
gain
an
audience
with
president
mcidiot
i
mean
president
mcfoot
i
suppose
it
does
me
no
good
to
make
fun
of
his
foolishness
not
foolishness
said
nibbles
just
lack
of
education
i
did
know
until
you
guys
just
said
so
that
rotation
of
crops
was
a
good
idea
mcfoot
just
does
know
about
farming
he
may
be
a
very
very
wise
man
in
a
lot
of
other
subjects
i
think
you
right
agreed
president
schnozzle
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
reacted
so
harshly
to
his
actions
which
i
can
now
see
that
he
did
out
of
true
concern
and
love
for
his
subjects
in
any
situation
said
lisa
it
is
always
best
to
act
rather
than
to
it
makes
you
look
a
lot
brighter
i
wholeheartedly
agree
said
elephant
however
we
still
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
get
mcfoot
into
a
position
to
speak
to
us
yes
said
ozma
that
is
true
if
only
we
could
lure
him
into
a
neutral
place
with
a
strong
downwind
then
we
could
the
little
queen
words
were
cut
off
as
a
sickening
stench
suddenly
blew
in
from
the
open
window
a
booming
voice
cried
out
that
is
the
home
of
schtupidface
schnozzle
torch
the
place
schnozzle
ran
to
the
window
and
saw
president
mcfoot
in
his
military
regalia
and
he
was
backed
up
by
several
dozen
stinkfoots
carrying
torches
oh
no
moaned
the
sniffer
president
we
are
too
late
the
entire
party
hurried
out
the
door
but
were
too
late
to
stop
the
offensive
army
from
setting
fire
to
the
home
of
president
schnozzle
my
home
cried
he
my
books
my
teddy
bear
my
original
rembrandt
halt
cried
ozma
i
am
your
queen
it
that
silly
little
girl
i
told
you
about
master
said
a
stinkfoot
that
ozma
recognized
as
the
man
who
had
answered
the
door
ignore
the
little
scamp
and
let
get
on
with
our
revolution
wait
a
minute
shuddered
president
mcfoot
i
have
seen
pictures
of
the
queen
of
oz
in
the
newspapers
the
place
no
longer
is
run
by
that
scarecrow
man
i
think
this
child
is
telling
the
truth
the
stinkfoot
soldiers
suddenly
stood
at
attention
and
saluted
ozma
your
majesty
spoke
the
stinkfoot
president
i
am
sorry
to
inform
you
that
there
is
a
war
on
we
have
need
of
something
that
these
sniffers
are
not
allowing
us
to
have
our
survival
depends
on
their
annihilation
no
spoke
ozma
it
does
not
my
dear
friends
from
the
lunechien
forest
have
determined
the
problems
with
your
crops
and
we
have
come
to
a
solution
she
quickly
outlined
the
plan
to
rotate
crops
and
territory
but
the
silly
have
such
a
modest
capitol
building
sniffed
president
mcfoot
i
would
not
want
to
live
in
that
little
old
shack
not
even
for
a
day
in
case
you
forgotten
said
elephant
your
troops
have
just
burned
up
that
little
shack
i
suggest
that
you
put
them
to
work
rebuilding
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
pleasing
to
you
both
if
i
go
along
with
this
idea
said
the
stinkfoot
leader
will
schnozface
do
the
same
i
have
already
agreed
to
it
said
president
schnozzle
though
i
must
add
that
the
whole
place
be
fumigated
before
we
trade
back
if
you
bind
starting
to
feel
a
little
queasy
with
the
situation
settled
ozma
felt
very
pleased
that
there
had
been
no
war
still
there
was
the
other
matter
to
contend
with
there
may
still
have
to
be
a
war
to
defeat
the
forest
monster
that
was
terrorizing
the
lunechien
forest
of
course
ozma
would
have
preferred
that
it
be
settled
as
well
as
this
situation
had
been
but
this
monster
was
obviously
not
going
to
be
ready
to
listen
to
reason
for
at
least
a
jillion
years
by
that
time
there
may
be
no
one
left
in
oz
to
stop
him
chapter
onward
toward
the
light
bulbs
the
sniffers
and
stinkfoots
agreed
to
help
in
the
lunechien
forest
should
their
services
be
needed
to
help
stop
the
devastation
brought
about
by
the
president
schnozzle
handed
ozma
a
small
perfume
bottle
that
when
opened
would
release
a
perfume
that
could
be
smelled
only
by
a
sniffer
and
would
reach
the
distance
from
the
forest
in
only
a
matter
of
minutes
ozma
pocketed
the
little
bottle
and
thanked
the
sniffer
and
stinkfoot
presidents
then
ozma
and
the
party
of
five
was
on
its
way
to
the
land
of
the
light
bulbs
how
far
is
it
from
here
asked
elephant
who
was
still
carrying
the
others
on
his
broad
back
well
said
hootsey
it
is
exactly
close
we
will
have
to
travel
through
some
fairly
rough
territory
to
get
to
the
light
bulbs
but
sure
our
pachyderm
is
up
to
it
if
anyone
is
and
we
do
have
our
new
queen
along
as
well
i
really
do
think
we
have
too
many
problems
however
unbeknownst
to
the
little
owl
problems
were
exactly
what
lay
ahead
of
them
the
elephant
walked
on
for
a
few
miles
without
incident
but
then
came
upon
a
marshy
area
i
do
remember
this
place
said
hootsey
with
disdain
the
marshy
area
was
barren
of
all
trees
stretched
out
before
them
lay
what
seemed
to
be
miles
of
reeds
surrounding
patches
of
dirty
looking
water
with
steam
rising
to
form
a
veritable
fog
the
whole
area
looked
very
formidable
and
quite
scary
i
do
like
this
a
bit
elephant
remarked
with
a
concerned
expression
on
his
face
who
knows
what
laying
in
wait
under
that
water
and
it
does
look
as
if
we
could
get
very
far
without
walking
through
it
and
who
knows
how
deep
the
water
is
tweaty
said
it
could
be
two
feet
or
twenty
maybe
even
some
of
the
solid
ground
is
really
quicksand
just
then
a
loud
twittering
sound
was
heard
soft
at
first
but
then
increasing
in
volume
to
totally
surround
the
little
group
then
heads
appeared
above
the
reeds
to
signify
the
source
of
the
twittering
the
heads
were
square
powdery
white
and
with
round
eyes
like
you
might
see
on
a
stuffed
toy
except
the
expression
on
the
square
faces
was
anything
but
cute
one
rather
large
creature
stood
up
to
reveal
a
body
of
the
same
substance
his
whole
body
looked
as
if
it
was
composed
of
giant
marshmallows
including
his
arms
and
legs
he
shouted
in
a
booming
voice
that
sounded
as
if
it
were
coming
out
of
the
bottom
of
a
barrel
i
suppose
you
people
think
you
are
going
to
traverse
our
lands
not
really
answered
elephant
oh
how
silly
of
me
of
course
you
are
just
here
for
a
picnic
responded
the
creature
with
a
sneer
i
should
have
realized
quick
grab
boys
the
little
band
was
immediately
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
the
creatures
who
threw
fishing
nets
over
them
then
rolled
out
wooden
cages
on
wheels
after
everyone
was
confined
in
the
cages
the
leader
stepped
forward
to
address
them
again
big
mistake
big
mistake
you
made
coming
here
not
one
trespasser
has
ever
set
foot
on
our
land
and
lived
to
tell
the
tale
you
see
we
are
the
keepers
of
the
crocodiles
who
live
in
these
marshes
and
swamps
and
in
return
for
keeping
them
well
fed
they
have
agreed
not
to
eat
us
and
to
allow
us
to
coexist
with
them
in
these
waters
the
substance
of
our
bodies
is
a
sweet
marshmallow
material
and
we
would
be
prey
to
all
kinds
of
creatures
if
we
had
to
depart
these
lands
we
were
made
of
the
same
material
you
are
at
one
time
but
we
made
the
mistake
of
crossing
swords
with
a
wicked
witch
and
in
a
fit
of
anger
before
you
could
say
robinson
she
changed
us
into
marshmallows
so
here
we
are
and
here
you
are
just
in
time
to
feed
a
bunch
of
hungry
crocodiles
which
is
too
bad
really
but
that
life
death
sooner
or
later
and
in
your
case
it
sooner
elephant
and
nibbles
and
tweaty
and
hootsey
and
ozma
and
lisa
all
looked
at
each
other
with
despair
and
foreboding
look
said
elephant
to
the
leader
of
the
marshmallow
people
i
am
a
huge
animal
my
body
will
keep
those
crocodiles
fed
for
weeks
while
tweaty
here
and
hootsey
and
lisa
are
tiny
creatures
the
crocodiles
would
not
even
taste
them
why
do
you
let
them
go
hmmmm
murmured
the
marshmallow
leader
you
have
a
point
there
in
fact
the
crocodiles
could
get
quite
annoyed
with
us
for
feeding
them
such
tiny
morsels
okay
we
let
them
go
but
what
about
her
he
said
pointing
to
ozma
she
would
be
quite
a
delicacy
delicacy
echoed
ozma
i
am
not
a
delicacy
i
am
ozma
queen
of
oz
the
marshmallow
man
looked
at
the
child
and
giggled
you
are
the
queen
of
something
yeah
right
and
i
suppose
that
next
you
going
to
tell
me
that
mortal
men
will
one
day
be
able
to
travel
to
the
moon
and
back
ha
that
a
laugh
but
it
true
argued
elephant
ozma
is
the
ruler
of
oz
indeed
added
lisa
i
admit
i
was
also
a
little
shaken
when
i
first
learned
that
the
queen
of
oz
was
a
little
girl
but
you
must
understand
that
ozma
is
of
fairy
descent
she
is
not
like
a
mortal
child
at
all
she
has
special
abilities
and
powers
that
illustration
elephant
and
others
in
cages
silence
shouted
the
marshmallow
man
i
am
not
interested
in
hearing
your
lies
this
child
is
simply
a
tender
and
mouthwatering
human
delicacy
for
the
crocodiles
to
eat
that
is
all
he
looked
at
ozma
and
laughed
fairy
descent
this
is
not
a
fairy
i
know
about
these
things
fairies
are
tiny
little
critters
with
wings
like
those
on
one
of
our
dragonflies
this
is
just
a
human
child
a
perfectly
ordinary
human
child
ozma
looked
at
him
indignantly
but
she
said
nothing
more
she
knew
that
it
would
be
hard
to
convince
anyone
of
her
origin
without
some
sort
of
proof
and
indeed
what
would
serve
as
sufficient
proof
to
convince
this
doubting
thomas
she
knew
all
too
well
that
throughout
history
skeptics
have
always
been
known
to
cling
to
what
they
thought
to
be
truth
even
when
it
was
a
foolish
belief
that
they
were
clinging
to
indeed
mortals
in
america
had
placed
a
great
deal
of
faith
in
a
substance
called
radium
a
highly
radioactive
and
dangerous
substance
radium
was
being
treated
as
a
miracle
medicine
that
had
been
hailed
as
a
for
anything
this
marshmallow
man
was
every
bit
as
as
the
mortal
men
if
she
were
going
to
prove
her
position
and
power
she
would
have
to
break
through
the
imaginary
wall
that
he
had
built
up
in
his
mind
concerning
the
proper
look
of
queens
and
fairies
my
good
man
she
said
in
her
most
dignified
voice
i
can
understand
why
you
might
assume
what
you
do
it
is
true
that
i
look
more
like
a
little
girl
than
the
ruler
of
a
vast
country
like
oz
and
it
is
true
that
some
fairy
groups
can
be
described
as
you
have
just
suggested
however
it
is
also
true
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
fairies
just
as
there
are
different
kinds
of
marshmallows
the
fairy
queen
lurliné
does
not
have
wings
and
she
looks
quite
human
too
but
if
it
is
so
important
to
you
i
can
probably
meet
with
your
needs
in
a
satisfactory
manner
she
put
her
fingers
to
her
temples
and
concentrated
what
are
you
doing
asked
the
marshmallow
man
in
puzzlement
then
chicanery
in
chittenango
he
exclaimed
you
have
wings
but
you
did
have
them
a
second
or
two
ago
nor
have
i
got
them
now
explained
ozma
but
i
have
made
myself
appear
to
you
as
you
would
have
me
appear
because
i
am
a
fairy
i
can
make
myself
look
any
way
i
please
but
underneath
i
am
still
the
same
little
girl
i
have
always
been
the
wings
vanished
again
but
how
can
this
be
shuddered
the
marshmallow
man
it
is
really
very
simple
explained
ozma
when
i
first
took
the
throne
of
oz
i
had
the
same
blonde
hair
that
you
see
me
with
now
but
i
might
decide
one
day
to
be
a
brunette
her
hair
suddenly
changed
color
as
she
spoke
or
even
a
redhead
again
the
child
hair
changed
color
why
if
i
had
a
mind
to
i
could
even
make
it
green
again
her
hair
color
changed
you
know
i
think
i
might
want
to
try
being
a
brunette
once
in
a
while
just
for
a
change
you
know
and
if
ever
i
must
meet
with
dignitaries
from
another
country
especially
one
of
those
mortal
lands
i
think
i
might
want
to
appear
to
them
as
an
adult
but
of
course
i
like
being
youthful
so
i
will
not
really
age
i
will
just
make
myself
appear
that
way
on
occasion
when
the
situation
calls
for
it
the
marshmallow
man
fell
to
his
marshmallow
knees
forgive
me
your
highness
he
said
you
really
are
a
fairy
i
most
humbly
apologize
for
my
mistake
but
you
must
admit
you
really
did
look
like
a
mere
human
child
how
was
i
to
know
i
do
think
it
should
have
mattered
said
elephant
do
you
really
imagine
that
it
is
ever
proper
to
feed
any
sentient
being
to
a
crocodile
even
a
regular
mortal
child
you
are
a
wild
animal
spoke
the
marshmallow
man
you
should
know
better
than
anyone
that
such
is
the
way
of
survival
we
do
not
want
the
crocodiles
to
eat
us
but
we
know
that
they
must
eat
i
doubt
that
they
would
be
satisfied
with
tofu
or
falafel
burgers
either
these
crocodiles
are
carnivorous
and
they
require
fresh
meat
in
order
to
survive
would
you
have
them
become
extinct
he
has
a
point
said
hootsey
we
really
ca
blame
the
crocodiles
for
their
metabolisms
but
we
ca
allow
them
to
eat
our
queen
either
oh
no
said
the
marshmallow
man
now
that
i
know
who
she
is
i
have
no
intention
of
feeding
her
to
the
crocodiles
any
more
nor
any
of
my
companions
said
ozma
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
would
not
tolerate
any
argument
but
you
do
have
a
legitimate
problem
you
are
citizens
of
oz
and
therefore
my
subjects
i
will
not
allow
any
of
my
subjects
to
be
threatened
by
any
carnivorous
crocodiles
then
the
crocodiles
will
not
be
able
to
survive
said
lisa
sadly
but
nothing
can
actually
die
anywhere
in
oz
said
nibbles
then
they
will
grow
horribly
uncomfortable
if
they
ca
eat
what
nature
dictates
they
should
said
lisa
i
for
one
would
rather
die
than
have
a
constant
emptiness
in
my
tummy
or
lack
of
energy
due
to
malnutrition
indeed
agreed
elephant
to
go
hungry
is
a
terrible
fate
is
there
some
alternative
nothing
short
of
allowing
the
crocodiles
to
eat
you
replied
the
marshmallow
man
then
all
is
lost
sighed
hootsey
our
benevolent
ruler
will
have
to
decide
who
will
be
the
recipient
of
her
benevolence
it
will
have
to
be
a
choice
between
the
carnivorous
crocodiles
or
their
natural
source
of
food
one
of
the
two
must
suffer
how
sad
said
lisa
i
had
always
heard
that
rulers
and
queens
had
a
tough
job
but
i
had
always
doubted
it
on
the
surface
it
looks
like
queens
get
to
live
in
beautiful
palaces
with
servants
who
meet
all
of
their
needs
and
they
are
allowed
to
go
to
bed
any
time
they
like
or
eat
chocolate
ice
cream
for
breakfast
if
they
wish
but
now
i
begin
to
understand
why
their
lives
are
so
difficult
i
sure
would
want
to
have
to
make
a
decision
like
that
basically
you
be
condemning
an
entire
race
to
extinction
just
like
the
dodo
bird
or
the
winkledejimpker
could
we
use
criminals
and
thieves
to
feed
to
the
crocodiles
suggested
nibbles
i
will
not
allow
even
them
to
be
tortured
this
way
said
ozma
even
a
thief
deserves
a
chance
to
make
up
for
his
past
misbehaving
then
what
can
we
do
asked
the
marshmallow
man
hey
said
elephant
suddenly
having
an
idea
there
is
a
grove
of
trees
that
grows
near
the
lunechien
forest
some
of
the
trees
have
fruits
growing
on
them
others
have
seed
pods
or
alarm
clocks
or
other
such
normal
things
that
one
always
expects
to
find
growing
on
trees
but
i
think
there
are
also
a
couple
of
ham
and
sausage
trees
there
i
bet
they
would
suffice
for
the
crocodiles
then
they
would
have
to
eat
any
living
creatures
in
order
to
satisfy
their
natural
cravings
a
grand
idea
said
the
marshmallow
man
i
have
never
heard
of
such
odd
trees
as
those
but
i
sure
the
crocodiles
will
be
thrilled
to
learn
that
they
no
longer
have
to
be
hated
and
feared
by
their
fellow
beings
of
course
said
lisa
no
one
wants
to
be
feared
and
if
they
are
now
able
to
get
their
meat
without
any
stalking
or
struggling
they
might
need
some
other
form
of
exercise
to
keep
from
growing
fat
or
sluggish
i
think
we
should
organize
some
group
activities
that
will
allow
the
crocodiles
and
owls
to
interact
together
as
friends
and
maybe
pinky
and
i
could
arrange
a
similar
thing
for
us
elephants
to
get
together
with
them
i
think
the
mice
would
be
a
little
too
scared
shuddered
nibbles
not
after
i
have
one
of
those
ham
trees
transplanted
in
their
marsh
said
ozma
she
turned
to
the
marshmallow
man
would
you
be
willing
to
take
charge
of
that
of
course
he
replied
it
will
also
make
my
own
people
live
in
greater
comfort
to
know
that
the
crocodiles
will
never
be
hungry
for
them
again
but
er
just
out
of
curiosity
are
there
any
marshmallow
trees
around
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
you
know
they
all
laughed
chapter
all
about
the
gilligoggs
and
the
droffs
the
droffs
and
the
gilligoggs
had
never
understood
each
other
they
were
a
different
people
really
for
example
the
droffs
were
creatures
with
forms
that
resembled
the
wooly
mammoth
they
had
short
squat
legs
like
tree
trunks
short
squat
little
bodies
with
arms
to
match
and
heads
that
were
too
large
for
their
bodies
with
eyes
that
were
buried
beneath
long
straggly
shaggy
fur
their
voices
had
a
deep
gruff
sound
not
unlike
a
cave
man
might
have
sounded
and
their
words
came
out
in
a
torrent
of
grunts
that
did
not
vary
in
tone
and
that
did
not
exactly
follow
the
rules
of
grammar
for
example
who
you
what
you
name
how
got
you
this
place
why
you
here
for
etc
whereas
the
gilligoggs
were
quite
elegant
even
sophisticated
compared
to
the
droffs
they
were
tall
and
slender
with
long
delicate
fingers
that
they
waved
expressively
as
they
talked
they
also
had
long
hair
but
it
was
as
soft
and
sweet
smelling
as
the
droffs
hair
was
coarse
and
pungent
their
faces
were
feminine
looking
even
the
males
with
long
curling
eyelashes
delicately
chiseled
features
full
lips
etc
the
only
perceptible
difference
between
the
males
and
females
was
that
the
voices
were
a
little
deeper
and
they
were
a
little
taller
anyway
as
you
can
imagine
two
peoples
that
were
so
different
had
very
little
love
for
one
another
why
this
should
be
i
do
not
know
except
that
people
with
different
appearances
seem
to
distrust
each
other
even
when
there
has
been
no
physical
aggression
between
them
neither
group
would
willingly
mix
with
the
other
either
socially
or
even
live
in
the
other
neighborhood
each
race
pretty
much
kept
to
itself
i
suppose
that
in
a
way
the
gilligoggs
looked
down
on
the
droffs
they
considered
them
somehow
inferior
to
themselves
the
droffs
were
well
aware
of
this
and
were
deeply
resentful
now
if
you
or
i
were
to
try
to
analyze
the
exact
reason
for
this
we
might
fall
short
of
our
goal
we
could
say
that
the
gilligoggs
were
far
more
intelligent
because
their
speech
was
more
sophisticated
but
if
you
took
the
trouble
to
get
to
know
a
droff
you
would
find
that
in
spite
of
their
crude
manner
of
speech
they
are
as
a
whole
equally
as
intelligent
as
the
gilligoggs
except
that
they
express
their
intelligence
in
a
different
way
another
argument
might
be
that
the
droffs
were
not
nearly
so
sweet
smelling
in
comparison
now
this
may
be
true
in
one
way
but
in
actual
fact
the
droffs
had
just
as
high
a
standard
of
personal
hygiene
as
the
gilligoggs
it
was
just
that
the
gilligoggs
olfactory
senses
were
sensitive
to
the
natural
scent
of
the
droffs
just
as
the
olfactory
senses
were
equally
sensitive
to
the
natural
scent
of
the
gilligoggs
and
while
neither
group
found
the
other
offensive
in
this
way
they
could
detect
a
difference
albeit
on
a
subconscious
level
another
argument
might
be
that
the
droffs
had
lower
social
standards
than
the
gilligoggs
this
argument
too
has
to
fall
by
the
wayside
for
reasons
that
we
will
not
go
into
here
the
droffs
had
had
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
the
joneses
so
to
speak
due
to
circumstances
beyond
their
control
they
had
not
done
quite
as
well
on
a
socioeconomic
scale
so
there
you
have
it
and
this
was
the
situation
that
elephant
and
his
pals
were
confronted
with
after
their
excursion
with
the
marshmallow
people
as
they
continued
on
their
way
to
the
home
of
the
they
hardly
expected
yet
another
interruption
but
it
happened
all
the
same
a
particularly
tall
and
attractive
gilligogg
woman
who
looked
to
be
about
sixteen
approached
them
she
had
dark
hair
that
glistened
in
the
sunlight
in
a
particularly
gorgeous
manner
which
reminded
lisa
of
fine
silk
greetings
said
ozma
to
the
young
lady
even
though
she
was
not
anxious
to
be
interrupted
again
she
was
always
polite
to
her
people
she
knew
that
in
order
to
be
a
good
ruler
for
the
land
of
oz
she
should
be
aware
of
the
individual
needs
of
all
of
the
ozites
good
morrow
came
the
reply
the
lady
voice
was
like
music
beautiful
music
such
as
is
usually
reserved
only
for
the
fairies
angels
or
gods
so
in
awe
of
this
lovely
lady
were
our
adventurers
that
only
ozma
found
her
voice
which
though
beautiful
in
its
own
youthful
manner
did
not
hold
a
candle
to
that
of
this
gilligogg
lady
i
am
ozma
the
queen
of
oz
said
the
little
girl
my
friends
and
i
are
on
our
way
to
enlist
the
help
of
some
people
who
live
beyond
your
territory
i
hope
you
wo
mind
if
we
pass
through
your
lovely
country
you
are
the
queen
said
the
lady
i
am
only
a
princess
far
be
it
from
me
to
tell
you
what
you
can
or
can
not
do
she
seemed
disinterested
as
she
spoke
my
name
is
dianna
and
my
father
is
the
ruler
of
the
gilligoggs
if
this
young
lady
felt
any
doubt
that
ozma
was
indeed
a
queen
she
did
not
let
on
indeed
she
seemed
unconcerned
as
to
the
identity
of
her
queen
but
i
shall
tell
you
that
the
gilligoggs
are
the
only
people
in
this
region
we
are
all
that
is
here
well
unless
you
count
the
droffs
but
you
could
not
be
looking
for
the
droffs
they
are
so
far
beneath
your
station
oh
no
sighed
tweaty
i
think
we
are
about
to
get
stuck
in
the
middle
of
another
battle
like
the
stinkfoot
and
sniffer
war
this
will
not
be
a
good
thing
for
any
of
the
lunechien
forest
denizens
why
for
all
we
know
that
forest
monster
may
already
have
destroyed
all
of
our
friends
and
neighbors
back
home
there
is
no
war
here
said
dianna
we
gilligoggs
are
above
such
barbarous
practices
why
if
i
had
to
fight
i
might
break
a
fingernail
but
we
do
wish
that
the
droffs
would
go
away
so
long
as
they
are
about
the
property
value
on
our
homes
must
surely
be
going
way
down
illustration
ozma
and
a
droff
my
my
said
elephant
are
these
droffs
some
sort
of
frightful
monsters
like
the
kalidahs
they
are
worse
said
dianna
with
a
most
elegant
and
sophisticated
shudder
they
look
like
well
actually
they
look
a
lot
like
you
only
they
are
all
hairy
and
vulgar
you
at
least
are
not
covered
with
all
that
coarse
fur
still
i
wonder
if
you
might
be
related
to
them
she
took
a
nail
file
from
her
pocket
and
looked
at
her
hands
in
an
uninterested
manner
so
then
they
are
elephants
asked
nibbles
shaggy
elephants
tweeted
tweaty
wooly
mammoths
questioned
lisa
and
hootsey
together
neither
of
those
replied
the
princess
they
are
just
droffs
we
did
not
come
to
seek
the
droffs
said
ozma
nor
did
we
come
to
see
the
gilligoggs
we
were
looking
for
the
are
they
not
in
this
area
they
are
said
hootsey
with
certainty
i
know
they
are
perhaps
said
the
young
lady
perhaps
they
are
among
the
droffs
i
do
not
know
of
them
nor
do
i
especially
care
to
they
might
be
unpleasant
but
how
can
you
know
whether
or
not
they
are
pleasant
if
you
refuse
even
to
see
them
best
to
be
safe
said
dianna
why
invite
trouble
we
gilligoggs
have
always
known
that
we
are
superior
to
all
other
living
beings
so
we
avoid
contact
with
anyone
else
if
we
start
to
invite
trouble
sure
to
get
it
in
great
doses
but
that
awful
put
in
tweaty
you
do
even
give
them
a
chance
why
should
we
they
are
not
gilligoggs
heavens
they
have
the
most
noses
she
eyed
elephant
in
a
scrutinizing
manner
i
think
i
should
like
to
meet
these
droffs
harrumphed
elephant
then
by
all
means
please
leave
as
quickly
as
you
can
said
dianna
i
would
not
want
my
people
to
have
to
gaze
upon
anyone
who
would
associate
with
droffs
they
are
messy
things
at
best
i
had
offered
you
a
great
honor
in
speaking
to
you
but
you
obviously
do
not
appreciate
it
had
the
dross
not
been
with
you
miss
queen
of
oz
i
should
not
have
even
acknowledged
them
good
day
to
you
so
saying
the
princess
walked
away
without
looking
back
our
six
adventurers
hurried
through
the
gilligogg
territory
few
of
the
gilligoggs
even
stopped
to
look
at
them
as
they
passed
through
before
long
they
came
upon
a
creature
who
looked
a
good
deal
like
elephant
and
who
was
obviously
a
droff
hey
said
the
droff
who
you
am
i
am
ozma
queen
of
oz
said
the
child
you
much
good
to
be
here
replied
the
droff
me
are
called
biff
who
is
them
each
of
the
five
lunechiens
introduced
himself
me
likes
elephant
lots
said
biff
him
look
like
droff
but
smooth
him
might
relative
to
me
i
maybe
like
droff
ozma
queen
and
others
like
eat
droffs
no
have
much
but
share
me
have
oatmeal
with
much
gravy
for
nice
queen
me
even
serve
with
sprinkles
me
likes
queen
lots
and
elephant
have
good
seeds
for
birdies
too
mouse
want
cheese
me
haves
swiss
usually
only
haves
swiss
on
sunday
it
is
holey
but
for
friend
of
good
and
nice
queen
me
get
some
for
nice
little
mouse
how
kind
said
nibbles
thank
you
the
droff
though
not
as
graceful
as
he
might
have
been
served
up
a
repast
that
was
happily
received
by
his
guests
the
droffs
are
obviously
more
hospitable
than
the
gilligoggs
said
tweaty
gilligoggs
echoed
biff
you
am
knowing
gilligoggs
we
just
passed
through
their
country
on
our
way
here
explained
lisa
me
wish
me
knew
gilligoggs
sighed
biff
them
not
let
droffs
pass
through
not
come
to
visit
droffs
neither
to
gilligogg
droff
land
just
place
to
dump
stuff
they
no
want
stuff
asked
ozma
what
stuff
old
stuff
most
replied
the
droff
rotted
foods
old
packages
cigarette
ends
you
am
knowing
stuff
what
slobs
said
lisa
with
distaste
and
that
princess
had
the
nerve
to
say
that
droffs
were
messy
but
it
explains
why
the
droffs
have
such
land
sighed
ozma
it
is
that
the
droffs
are
unsanitary
the
very
reason
the
gilligoggs
look
down
on
the
droffs
is
caused
by
the
gilligoggs
themselves
they
are
high
and
sophisticated
i
guess
added
hootsey
but
their
refusal
to
see
what
they
are
doing
to
the
world
around
them
has
made
them
into
a
life
form
that
is
most
undesirable
they
have
made
themselves
become
exactly
what
they
dislike
in
others
me
thinks
that
is
not
gilligogg
fault
said
biff
defending
his
neighbors
me
has
seen
that
all
hatred
do
that
lots
if
you
hate
something
so
bad
that
you
try
to
be
away
from
it
a
lot
you
start
to
be
turning
into
it
you
self
me
not
like
hate
me
hate
hate
most
hatefulishly
yes
agreed
lisa
when
knowledge
is
used
for
cruel
purposes
there
is
no
knowledge
any
more
both
sides
end
up
losers
i
think
the
gilligoggs
could
learn
a
lot
from
the
droffs
me
thank
you
owl
bird
said
biff
with
a
smile
you
am
nice
me
likes
you
me
likes
i
mean
i
like
you
too
said
lisa
now
tell
me
do
you
know
of
the
echoed
biff
not
know
not
do
maybe
friend
know
of
that
though
friend
are
much
smart
and
also
wise
him
have
good
and
useful
glass
head
him
and
him
people
living
close
nearby
them
have
seen
much
hmmm
said
ozma
have
them
got
large
sharp
teeth
oh
yes
said
biff
much
good
for
opening
packages
much
nice
friends
are
you
be
liking
droffs
friends
me
can
take
pretty
queen
and
nice
elephant
and
friends
to
see
droffs
friend
as
shortly
as
you
am
finishing
eatings
me
can
show
to
other
droffs
too
i
would
like
that
very
much
said
ozma
i
think
i
will
like
the
droffs
just
fine
and
them
would
be
liking
you
said
biff
with
certainty
as
soon
as
the
visitors
finished
eating
the
kindly
droff
led
them
to
an
adjacent
valley
wherein
they
saw
bright
lights
these
as
hootsey
explained
were
the
light
bulbs
themselves
from
a
distance
they
looked
pretty
much
like
ordinary
light
bulbs
but
as
our
little
party
drew
closer
they
could
see
the
individuality
of
each
light
bulb
one
of
the
larger
light
bulbs
saw
them
approaching
and
lit
up
look
fellows
he
said
it
biff
and
he
has
brought
some
friends
along
hi
watts
said
biff
to
the
light
bulb
me
is
so
happy
to
seeing
you
me
haves
the
queen
of
oz
here
too
her
wants
to
meet
you
her
are
much
good
and
nice
you
are
liking
her
of
course
replied
watts
any
friend
of
biff
is
a
friend
of
mine
he
extended
one
of
his
long
appendages
to
the
small
queen
she
took
it
in
her
hand
it
is
a
pleasure
said
watts
to
ozma
i
had
heard
that
oz
had
a
new
queen
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
are
a
one
thank
you
said
ozma
so
what
can
i
do
for
you
asked
watts
quickly
realizing
that
there
had
to
be
some
sort
of
business
that
had
brought
the
queen
to
see
him
well
began
ozma
not
sure
just
how
to
begin
her
explanation
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
has
come
upon
a
problem
oh
no
said
watts
that
awful
what
kind
of
a
problem
it
seems
that
there
is
a
terrible
monster
that
is
threatening
our
fine
forest
she
began
a
very
large
creature
sounds
beastly
shuddered
the
light
bulb
and
he
can
sap
away
the
energy
from
any
living
creature
and
render
him
an
empty
shell
of
himself
added
tweaty
my
said
watts
that
does
sound
like
a
problem
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
if
you
need
to
move
away
from
this
monster
you
are
welcome
to
join
us
the
droffs
and
the
are
not
crowded
in
we
can
make
room
that
is
very
kind
of
you
said
the
ruler
but
i
was
hoping
that
maybe
you
could
come
and
stand
up
to
the
forest
monster
no
one
else
can
do
it
even
i
would
hesitate
to
approach
them
but
i
know
that
you
could
do
it
how
could
any
foe
of
any
size
stand
against
you
you
want
us
to
fight
this
forest
monster
said
watts
fearfully
well
sighed
ozma
i
am
not
usually
in
favor
of
such
cruelty
i
would
be
sorry
to
harm
him
but
i
am
left
with
little
choice
already
he
is
too
strong
to
be
reckoned
with
i
have
been
a
queen
for
only
a
short
time
i
do
have
fairy
powers
but
am
not
anxious
to
face
the
forest
monster
myself
if
you
could
at
least
back
me
up
while
i
try
to
reason
with
him
do
waste
your
time
said
tweaty
you
ca
reason
with
that
thing
it
will
bite
you
in
half
before
you
get
past
the
greeting
say
interjected
hootsey
maybe
that
is
so
we
have
already
seen
ozma
do
some
amazing
things
she
can
change
the
color
of
her
hair
for
example
maybe
she
could
use
some
of
her
fairy
magic
to
scare
away
the
spider
why
if
she
can
change
her
physical
form
she
could
easily
become
a
giant
or
a
kalidah
ozma
looked
fearful
i
not
sure
i
want
to
try
that
she
said
i
might
just
make
him
all
the
more
angry
he
may
already
have
more
power
than
we
think
he
has
but
you
do
have
a
point
i
do
have
some
powers
that
i
should
try
to
make
use
of
having
only
been
a
fairy
for
a
short
time
i
not
altogether
sure
what
powers
i
may
have
at
my
disposal
alas
i
was
the
boy
tip
for
so
long
that
i
have
not
had
much
practice
being
ozma
yet
you
could
practice
some
magic
on
me
said
tweaty
trying
to
be
helpful
maybe
you
can
turn
the
forest
monster
into
a
pumpkin
or
something
i
do
mind
if
you
practice
on
me
so
long
as
you
put
me
back
the
way
i
supposed
to
be
that
sounds
like
a
good
idea
agreed
the
but
still
i
happy
to
come
along
to
back
you
up
that
way
if
i
am
needed
i
be
there
if
i
am
not
needed
after
all
i
will
still
have
had
a
nice
bit
of
travel
to
write
about
in
my
journal
you
are
very
kind
said
the
little
queen
and
i
am
sure
that
i
must
practice
using
my
powers
a
lot
more
than
i
already
have
this
will
be
a
good
learning
experience
for
me
and
can
only
make
me
a
better
ruler
for
the
land
of
oz
she
put
her
hands
to
her
temples
and
concentrated
on
the
canary
am
i
changing
asked
the
bird
you
look
the
same
to
me
answered
lisa
i
need
my
silver
wand
said
ozma
that
often
helps
me
while
gaining
prowess
at
a
new
spell
she
had
the
magical
tool
with
her
so
she
took
it
from
its
case
and
made
a
number
of
intricate
passes
in
the
air
with
it
still
tweaty
failed
to
change
maybe
there
are
some
words
you
supposed
to
say
while
you
doing
your
magic
spell
wondered
elephant
yes
said
ozma
as
a
jumped
over
her
head
i
think
right
let
me
think
i
should
know
the
word
she
again
put
her
hands
to
her
head
and
concentrated
she
said
in
a
chanting
voice
tweaty
began
to
change
in
form
and
substance
within
moments
he
had
taken
on
the
shape
of
a
housecat
he
still
had
his
yellow
feathers
however
awk
he
said
look
what
you
did
to
me
this
is
the
worst
possible
form
to
place
on
a
canary
turn
me
back
please
turn
me
back
i
meant
to
make
you
a
pumpkin
sighed
ozma
but
this
is
still
new
to
me
i
will
try
again
this
time
tweaty
became
an
orange
elephant
he
was
no
larger
than
he
had
been
as
a
cat
but
his
shape
was
very
clearly
that
of
a
pachyderm
how
cute
said
elephant
you
look
like
me
only
smaller
and
oranger
yeah
said
tweaty
i
guess
i
do
but
i
not
sure
this
is
going
to
work
on
the
forest
monster
if
you
were
to
change
him
into
another
sentient
animal
he
just
go
back
and
do
it
all
over
again
you
must
turn
him
into
something
inanimate
but
please
this
is
very
uncomfortable
i
used
to
being
able
to
fly
at
will
and
this
form
seems
so
so
ungainly
no
offense
elephant
i
think
you
make
a
terrific
elephant
but
i
make
a
lousy
one
but
you
do
make
a
wonderful
bird
agreed
the
pachyderm
yes
ozma
do
put
him
back
the
way
he
was
as
adorable
as
he
is
he
is
exactly
a
model
specimen
of
my
race
of
course
said
ozma
again
raising
her
silver
wand
she
did
her
spell
once
more
this
time
nothing
happened
i
am
sorry
sighed
ozma
i
am
already
feeling
exhausted
i
afraid
i
will
have
to
wait
a
while
before
i
can
do
it
again
you
mean
said
tweaty
i
have
to
look
like
this
until
you
are
able
to
rest
up
i
afraid
so
said
ozma
sadly
i
sure
that
will
change
as
i
grow
more
experienced
you
have
to
remember
i
am
only
beginning
to
get
my
as
a
fairy
once
i
am
more
proficient
i
sure
i
be
able
to
do
things
like
this
all
day
long
without
becoming
exhausted
just
give
me
time
and
in
the
meantime
i
have
to
look
like
a
little
orange
elephant
sighed
tweaty
i
sure
glad
my
mother
ca
see
me
right
now
but
tweaty
not
the
main
issue
right
this
minute
said
watts
not
that
i
am
unsympathetic
with
his
feelings
or
anything
like
that
but
i
do
sense
a
certain
degree
of
urgency
at
getting
to
your
forest
monster
quickly
i
sure
that
all
of
the
will
be
happy
to
go
and
see
what
we
can
do
we
are
always
anxious
to
help
good
folks
like
yourselves
and
even
though
it
is
something
i
terribly
proud
of
i
can
be
very
ferocious
when
i
have
a
mind
to
be
as
if
to
prove
his
statement
watts
opened
his
mouth
as
wide
as
he
could
revealing
the
teeth
ozma
had
ever
seen
indeed
his
teeth
resembled
sabres
which
may
have
been
the
reason
for
their
title
elephant
shuddered
in
his
skin
i
sure
that
a
few
of
you
would
aptly
frighten
the
forest
monster
out
of
our
forest
he
said
tremblingly
hopefully
out
of
oz
altogether
splendid
replied
watts
come
follow
me
i
know
a
that
will
allow
us
to
avoid
the
gilligoggs
not
that
i
am
afraid
of
the
gilligoggs
or
anything
i
just
find
them
unpleasant
to
have
to
deal
with
come
this
way
and
we
will
soon
be
on
our
way
to
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
chapter
and
he
shows
them
pearly
whites
as
the
little
group
together
with
a
party
of
five
of
the
turned
a
bend
in
the
road
they
came
upon
a
huge
dried
sea
bed
they
could
see
for
miles
and
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
i
think
we
in
uncharted
territory
remarked
elephant
peering
into
the
distance
i
do
remember
anyone
ever
mentioning
this
but
it
looks
safe
enough
to
cross
no
more
unpleasant
surprises
i
sure
at
that
moment
a
deep
disembodied
voice
said
dinnah
iss
serffed
laddies
and
lassies
pliss
shtep
oop
to
da
table
everyone
turned
around
to
see
who
was
speaking
but
could
see
no
one
suddenly
several
mounds
of
sand
that
they
had
not
noticed
before
began
to
quiver
and
slowly
rise
a
couple
of
feet
above
the
ground
the
mounds
shook
themselves
and
the
sand
fell
off
to
reveal
about
fifty
white
they
were
not
suspended
above
the
ground
as
it
first
seemed
but
were
supported
with
legs
like
an
alligator
this
was
a
frightening
scene
to
behold
as
you
can
well
imagine
and
when
their
leader
approached
our
heroes
he
repeated
the
words
dinnah
iss
serffed
and
licked
his
lips
with
anticipation
he
spoke
again
in
that
very
strange
accent
this
time
addressing
elephant
vatt

a
madder
vi
chew

all
the

laughed
uproariously
whereupon
they
surrounded
our
heroes
and
promptly
lay
back
down
in
the
sand
and
went
to
sleep
well
said
watts
this
is
a
fine
but
i
do
think
we
have
to
worry
about
these
guys
too
much
i
seriously
doubt
they
could
eat
glass
so
we
can
protect
the
rest
of
you
he
smiled
a
very
sharp
toothy
smile
besides
they
seem
to
be
very
lazy
it
is
like
enclosed
us
in
a
cage
or
anything
like
that
what
to
stop
us
from
simply
slipping
out
between
two
of
them
and
walking
away

watts
and
his
friends
made
their
most
ferocious
faces
at
the
land
sharks
you
will
allow
us
all
to
go
said
watts
to
the
shark
you
will
not
hold
any
of
us
back
besides
we
have
with
us
the
queen
of
oz
your
own
queen
for
crying
out
loud
chew
does
have
some
pretty
teeth
don

said
the
watchman
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
chew
zo
chew
should
leave
now
i
do
not
know
chust
vat
a
queen
might
be
but
i
am
sure
that
it
iss
delissious
we
do
not
have
time
for
this
hooted
lisa
we
are
on
an
important
mission
to
save
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
from
a
gigantic
forest
monster
and
you
had
better
not
hold
us
back
the
forest
monster
is
already
bigger
than
the
lot
of
you
and
he
will
come
for
you
sooner
or
later
if
you
do
let
us
stop
him
vorest
monzter
echoed
the
great
shark
that
what
i
said
replied
lisa
angrily
chust
vat
iss
ze
vorest
monzter
made
uff
asked
the
shark
er
i
do
know
whatever
monsters
are
usually
made
of
answered
the
female
owl
flesh
and
blood
i
guess
und
he
iss
ass
big
ass
chew
zay
he
iss
asked
the
shark
probably
bigger
by
now
put
in
tweaty
realizing
what
was
happening
zen
ve
shall
eat
ziss
vorest
monzter
said
the
shark
ve
shall
eat
him
he
iss
only
bones
lisa
was
not
entirely
sure
the
forest
monster
had
any
bones
as
she
suspected
that
spiders
had
exoskeletons
instead
but
she
saw
no
reason
to
bring
this
up
at
the
moment
then
you
really
do
need
us
it
is
against
the
laws
of
the
jungle
to
kill
more
than
you
can
eat
and
the
forest
monster
will
easily
tide
you
over
for
a
good
long
time
ozma
was
not
quite
happy
with
the
way
things
were
turning
out
she
was
not
an
advocate
of
killing
at
all
the
thought
of
her
willingly
placing
one
of
her
subjects
even
one
so
wicked
as
the
forest
monster
in
mortal
danger
was
a
hard
pill
for
her
to
swallow
still
this
development
had
apparently
removed
the
threat
to
her
own
hide
then
we
shall
be
on
our
way
she
said
i
will
wish
you
a
good
night
the
shark
thanked
her
and
having
no
one
left
that
he
had
to
guard
settled
down
to
sleep
among
his
fellows
this
is
odd
said
ozma
as
the
group
continued
on
its
way
we
set
out
to
rid
ourselves
of
the
forest
monster
and
now
i
feel
inclined
to
find
him
so
that
we
can
warn
him
of
his
pending
danger
you
are
kidding
are
you
asked
watts
ozma
only
looked
solemnly
at
the
ground
and
kept
walking
chapter
the
lion
king
now
when
the
cowardly
lion
of
oz
had
first
tangled
with
and
beheaded
the
forest
monster
the
other
animals
of
the
area
had
named
him
their
king
they
had
since
come
to
recognize
ozma
as
the
overall
ruler
of
oz
but
they
joyfully
accepted
their
tawny
savior
as
their
local
leader
the
cowardly
lion
had
taken
to
the
job
as
well
as
any
coward
could
be
expected
to
do
he
knew
that
when
he
had
accepted
this
position
of
power
he
also
took
on
a
responsibility
the
other
animals
were
now
his
subjects
and
he
felt
it
was
his
duty
to
protect
them
from
outside
dangers
such
as
hunters
or
other
predators
he
also
thought
it
politic
to
offer
his
advice
whenever
one
of
his
new
charges
had
a
question
or
a
problem
it
was
one
such
event
that
is
pertinent
to
this
part
of
our
story
about
a
week
prior
to
queen
ozma
meeting
with
the
land
sharks
a
young
wombat
had
come
to
the
cowardly
lion
to
ask
his
advice
hello
said
the
smaller
creature
your
majesty
cowardly
lion
sir
yes
replied
the
lion
looking
around
to
see
where
the
voice
had
come
from
that
said
when
his
large
eyes
came
upon
the
wombat
he
seemed
to
smile
why
ricardo
there
you
are
i
see
you
at
first
how
are
you
doing
okay
i
guess
said
the
wombat
and
your
mother
added
the
lion
she
fine
said
ricardo
i
am
very
happy
to
hear
it
said
the
cowardly
lion
but
tell
me
my
friend
why
you
seem
so
glum
a
boy
your
age
should
have
any
problems
that
would
cause
such
glumness
what
wrong
illustration
cowardly
lion
and
wombat
weeeeell
began
the
wombat
slowly
it
kind
of
silly
i
guess
but
i
wanted
to
ask
your
advice
about
something
you
think
it
silly
to
ask
my
advice
said
the
cowardly
lion
pretending
to
be
hurt
no
that
not
what
i
meant
replied
ricardo
i
mean
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
is
kind
of
silly
i
not
sure
it
would
be
right
to
waste
your
time
on
i
think
i
should
leave
now
he
turned
to
leave
now
now
said
the
lion
becoming
serious
again
no
problem
that
is
troubling
one
of
my
subjects
is
silly
nor
is
it
a
waste
of
my
time
to
hear
the
needs
of
today
youth
what
troubling
you
my
boy
well
began
ricardo
you
see
well
i
have
this
friend
oh
it
about
a
friend
is
it
said
the
cowardly
lion
knowingly
oh
no
said
ricardo
i
not
trying
to
pass
the
buck
it
really
is
about
a
friend
of
mine
you
see
he
a
real
copy
cat
he
likes
to
do
everything
i
do
and
he
does
it
exactly
the
same
way
and
it
driving
me
i
want
to
tell
him
to
think
for
himself
but
i
not
sure
how
to
go
about
it
so
what
is
it
that
he
does
that
you
do
want
him
to
do
asked
the
lion
i
mean
if
he
is
doing
exactly
as
you
are
you
must
be
having
a
good
time
together
are
you
no
i
mean
like
like
last
week
i
found
a
really
neat
shiny
rock
that
i
thought
i
would
like
to
keep
i
took
it
home
with
me
and
when
henry
saw
it
he
went
out
and
got
one
that
was
just
like
it
is
that
bad
asked
the
lion
the
rocks
are
there
for
everyone
to
use
as
they
need
them
what
the
matter
with
that
and
when
i
made
a
welcome
mat
for
my
mom
to
put
in
front
of
our
home
henry
went
and
made
one
like
it
for
his
mom
it
like
he
ca
think
of
anything
for
himself
he
has
to
use
all
of
my
ideas
i
wish
he
would
find
his
own
means
of
expressing
himself
instead
of
always
stealing
my
ideas
it
like
i
learned
a
new
song
that
i
was
going
to
sing
at
wombat
school
and
then
henry
went
and
learned
it
too
the
cowardly
lion
looked
at
ricardo
and
seemed
to
smile
again
ah
ricardo
he
said
i
think
your
little
friend
is
doing
it
out
of
affection
for
you
imitation
after
all
is
the
highest
form
of
flattery
well
next
to
bringing
you
food
at
least
i
think
your
friend
just
admires
you
so
much
that
he
wants
to
be
just
like
you
really
said
ricardo
gee
whiz
i
had
thought
about
that
i
thought
it
was
just
that
he
refused
to
think
for
himself
or
maybe
that
he
felt
i
did
deserve
to
have
anything
he
did
or
that
he
simply
wanted
to
drive
me
insane
but
maybe
you
right
he
does
seem
to
like
to
hang
around
with
me
a
lot
maybe
he
just
wants
to
imitate
me
because
he
admires
me
that
pretty
neat
yes
it
is
said
the
cowardly
lion
so
you
have
a
responsibility
to
henry
now
as
a
role
model
a
what
asked
ricardo
a
role
model
explained
the
lion
if
henry
is
going
to
do
everything
you
do
you
certainly
do
want
to
do
anything
too
foolish
oh
yeah
agreed
ricardo
that
true
thanks
for
your
advice
mr
lion
king
sir
any
time
ricardo
laughed
the
lion
be
sure
to
give
my
respects
to
your
mother
i
will
said
the
wombat
scampering
off
happily
and
chanting
something
under
his
breath
about
being
a
role
model
if
only
the
problems
of
the
adults
were
as
easily
handled
as
that
laughed
the
king
mr
your
majesty
came
another
voice
i
want
to
ask
you
some
advice
the
cowardly
lion
looked
and
saw
another
wombat
aha
he
said
let
me
guess
your
name
is
henry
right
gee
replied
the
smaller
animal
you
know
my
name
you
must
know
everything
i
do
said
the
lion
jokingly
and
i
had
a
feeling
that
you
be
along
soon
so
what
troubling
you
oh
it
nothing
much
i
just
really
wanted
to
come
and
talk
to
you
i
see
laughed
the
king
you
are
friends
with
ricardo
are
you
not
the
little
wombat
eyes
seemed
to
grow
out
of
their
sockets
you
really
know
everything
you
really
do
i
sorry
i
cheated
on
my
last
spelling
test
i
promise
i
never
do
it
again
the
cowardly
lion
was
a
little
taken
aback
by
this
statement
but
he
covered
it
well
i
was
going
to
bring
that
up
if
you
did
he
lied
you
must
tell
your
teacher
and
make
up
the
test
if
you
want
to
grow
up
to
be
a
king
like
me
oh
i
will
agreed
henry
i
will
go
and
tell
her
right
now
he
dashed
off
toward
the
wombat
schoolyard
and
so
i
am
now
a
psychic
laughed
the
lion
next
i
be
expected
to
be
able
to
fly
or
to
leap
over
tall
buildings
in
a
single
bound
but
i
guess
it
all
part
of
being
a
king
and
i
have
to
show
my
subjects
that
i
am
a
good
king
so
i
must
do
my
best
to
be
all
that
they
expect
me
to
be
i
got
to
be
strong
and
try
to
hang
on
i
have
to
be
kind
and
understanding
toward
their
needs
and
most
of
all
i
have
to
be
brave
he
let
out
a
practice
roar
that
shook
the
very
ground
beneath
his
paws
i
am
a
brave
lion
i
am
the
king
of
the
beasts
i
am
feared
by
all
and
i
fear
nothing
i
am
brave
and
i
am
as
a
grasshopper
leaped
in
front
of
him
the
lion
nearly
jumped
out
of
his
skin
aaaaaah
he
cried
what
is
it
what
i
see
i
saw
something
move
another
grasshopper
jumped
in
the
air
and
the
lion
that
strong
and
courageous
king
of
all
beasts
bravely
turned
tail
and
ran
chapter
the
cowardly
lion
and
the
forest
monster
of
oz
the
cowardly
lion
ran
and
ran
he
had
no
idea
just
how
long
or
how
far
he
had
gone
when
he
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
this
sort
of
cowardice
is
sure
to
make
me
old
before
my
time
he
said
to
himself
as
he
settled
down
in
a
pile
of
leaves
for
a
short
rest
he
heard
something
rustling
in
the
bushes
nearby
wha
he
said
what
that
who
there
hurt
me
mr
lion
came
a
voice
are
you
shivered
the
lion
by
way
of
an
answer
a
small
brown
monkey
with
shaggy
fur
walked
slowly
out
of
the
brush
do
eat
me
mr
lion
he
said
fearfully
do
worry
replied
the
cowardly
lion
i
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
what
were
you
doing
in
the
bushes
i
heard
you
coming
and
i
was
afraid
explained
the
simian
i
can
identify
with
that
said
the
lion
with
a
smile
i
was
afraid
that
you
might
be
one
of
those
awful
that
saps
away
the
energy
from
everyone
else
continued
the
monkey
but
i
can
see
that
you
are
not
you
are
a
much
nicer
fellow
than
that
i
think
i
seen
a
portrait
of
you
somewhere
in
fact
you
are
my
oh
my
can
it
be
true
you
him
are
you
who
asked
the
big
cat
you
are
the
great
lion
that
defeated
the
forest
monster
before
said
the
monkey
i
sure
of
it
what
other
lion
in
oz
is
so
big
are
you
the
one
who
is
called
the
cowardly
lion
of
oz
yeah
said
the
lion
not
especially
proud
of
the
title
but
happy
that
he
was
so
famous
with
even
this
small
monkey
that
he
had
never
seen
before
that
right
i
am
the
cowardly
lion
of
oz
it
is
a
title
that
is
far
more
honest
than
flattering
and
who
might
you
be
i
am
cubby
said
the
monkey
i
live
in
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
lunechien
forest
echoed
the
lion
i
not
sure
just
where
that
is
is
it
far
from
here
pretty
far
sighed
cubby
i
was
running
away
running
away
replied
the
lion
whose
nature
was
beginning
to
surface
now
dear
little
cubby
my
lad
whatever
problems
you
may
be
having
at
home
are
no
reason
to
run
away
you
ca
run
away
from
your
problems
you
should
go
back
and
try
to
talk
it
out
why
i
can
you
do
understand
said
cubby
i
was
running
away
like
a
child
who
has
had
a
disagreement
with
his
parents
over
a
cookie
or
something
i
was
running
for
my
life
oh
replied
the
cowardly
lion
well
then
that
a
whole
different
ball
of
wax
if
you
were
huh
what
you
were
running
for
your
life
what
do
you
mean
the
forest
monster
has
been
sucking
the
energy
out
of
all
of
the
animals
of
the
lunechien
forest
and
i
know
he
was
coming
for
me
next
i
was
so
afraid
i
just
wanted
to
get
away
from
there
as
swiftly
as
i
could
then
when
i
heard
your
heavy
breathing
i
thought
it
was
the
forest
monster
coming
for
me
i
thought
for
sure
i
was
a
goner
the
forest
monster
echoed
the
lion
but
i
do
understand
i
had
a
with
him
once
myself
i
knocked
his
head
off
while
he
was
sleeping
i
know
it
was
hardly
sporting
to
do
it
that
way
and
i
am
a
little
ashamed
that
i
did
even
give
him
a
sporting
chance
but
i
have
to
think
of
the
innocent
beasts
whose
lives
were
at
stake
illustration
cowardly
lion
and
cubby
i
think
there
may
be
more
than
one
said
cubby
unless
the
one
you
fought
somehow
got
himself
repaired
i
suspect
that
would
to
be
the
case
stammered
the
cowardly
lion
i
think
there
could
be
more
than
one
of
those
creatures
i
had
assumed
it
was
created
by
magic
sort
of
like
a
green
elephant
or
something
but
if
it
is
alive
again
it
will
probably
find
out
who
it
was
that
defeated
it
before
it
will
be
looking
for
me
i
afraid
it
already
knows
who
you
are
spoke
cubby
and
it
has
found
a
way
to
take
the
energy
from
other
beings
and
use
it
for
itself
it
is
already
so
powerful
that
i
doubt
anyone
could
stand
against
it
he
paused
oh
except
for
you
of
course
i
know
you
could
defeat
it
you
did
it
before
er
yeah
said
the
lion
his
eyes
growing
to
several
times
their
normal
size
i
i
he
was
so
much
easier
to
tackle
when
he
was
asleep
now
that
he
has
multiplied
his
power
i
sure
i
do
it
again
oh
but
you
can
you
must
said
the
monkey
encouragingly
you
let
him
keep
getting
stronger
and
stronger
sooner
or
later
he
will
find
you
and
he
probably
wo
stop
at
that
he
may
cross
the
desert
and
go
into
the
mortal
lands
he
might
start
attacking
ix
or
mo
or
even
merryland
and
then
he
may
infiltrate
the
mortal
lands
like
america
where
your
friend
dorothy
lives
said
the
lion
suddenly
looking
more
angry
than
afraid
she
just
a
little
kid
he
would
do
that
to
a
child
he
did
it
to
several
of
the
small
and
helpless
beasts
in
the
lunechien
forest
said
the
simian
even
insects
are
not
safe
from
him
well
he
is
a
spider
as
far
as
that
goes
replied
the
cowardly
lion
insects
are
a
normal
diet
for
him
but
small
children
are
not
how
dare
he
even
think
of
hurting
little
dorothy
what
a
wicked
creature
he
really
is
where
is
he
let
me
have
a
talk
with
this
nasty
arachnid
that
the
spirit
cheered
cubby
come
on
let
go
the
lion
had
already
forgotten
about
his
exhausted
condition
the
thought
of
dorothy
being
in
danger
had
taken
precedence
over
all
other
thoughts
in
his
head
he
followed
cubby
closely
until
he
felt
he
had
to
rest
they
traveled
and
rested
for
as
long
as
it
took
before
at
last
they
reached
the
border
of
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
i
sure
hope
we
can
find
him
in
his
sleep
again
whispered
the
lion
to
himself
come
on
said
cubby
i
know
where
his
lair
is
if
he
has
moved
on
to
more
densely
populated
territory
that
is
it
be
rude
to
just
in
on
him
said
the
lion
his
cowardly
nature
suddenly
returning
i
do
think
so
replied
cubby
i
think
we
need
to
stop
his
wicked
deeds
as
soon
as
we
possibly
can
we
ca
let
him
get
to
dorothy
you
know
nor
the
scarecrow
or
the
tin
woodman
or
the
no
one
is
safe
as
long
as
the
forest
monster
is
at
large
you
right
said
the
cowardly
lion
dutifully
we
are
the
only
ones
who
can
stop
him
where
is
this
overgrown
daddy
long
legs
cubby
led
the
huge
animal
through
the
forest
to
the
lair
of
the
gigantic
spider
when
they
got
there
they
were
met
with
a
most
unexpected
sight
there
was
a
pack
of
land
sharks
they
looked
frightful
and
hungry
and
they
surrounded
ozma
tweaty
nibbles
lisa
hootsey
and
elephant
those
are
some
of
my
friends
who
live
in
this
forest
explained
cubby
except
for
the
little
girl
i
do
know
who
she
is
is
that
dorothy
no
said
the
lion
his
voice
sounding
hollow
what
is
she
doing
here
why
are
your
friends
here
they
should
have
followed
your
act
and
fled
it
iss
dinnah
time
shouted
one
of
the
land
sharks
i
believe
ve
shall
bekin
vith
ze
big
gray
helefantt
no
said
cubby
do
let
them
do
it
the
cowardly
lion
trembled
with
fear
as
he
watched
the
huge
land
shark
turn
to
face
the
little
monkey
when
the
shark
moved
toward
cubby
with
its
jagged
teeth
exposed
he
pounced
on
it
get
ziss
kitty
offa
my
back
screamed
the
land
shark
it
hass
sharp
clawss
und
zay
are
hurtin
me
the
lion
jumped
off
and
the
impact
of
his
jump
knocked
the
land
shark
over
to
tell
the
truth
the
land
shark
legs
were
rather
thin
and
his
balance
was
not
very
good
to
begin
with
this
displayed
to
the
others
the
land
sharks
main
weakness
thinking
quickly
on
his
feet
elephant
raced
toward
another
of
the
sharks
and
knocked
it
over
on
its
face
the
shark
front
teeth
were
dislodged
and
it
ran
behind
its
fellows
without
its
teeth
the
land
shark
was
much
more
vulnerable
than
it
had
been
previously
seeing
that
the
other
land
sharks
were
distracted
by
the
lion
and
elephant
the
forest
monster
took
its
opportunity
to
strike
within
moments
the
land
shark
was
no
longer
a
threat
to
anyone
having
been
drained
of
all
of
its
life
force
the
added
burst
of
energy
gave
the
forest
monster
more
ability
to
take
out
more
of
the
land
sharks
but
he
was
so
preoccupied
that
he
failed
to
notice
watts
and
his
four
companions
surround
him
with
their
ferocious
teeth
bared
this
caused
the
forest
monster
to
hesitate
while
he
sized
up
the
situation
here
he
was
the
bad
guy
trying
to
get
bigger
and
stronger
at
the
expense
of
the
land
sharks
yet
at
the
same
time
inadvertently
saving
ozma
and
her
friends
and
now
ozma
forces
were
bearing
down
on
him
while
his
back
was
turned
hey
this
is
grossly
unfair
he
said
almost
crying
just
then
a
group
of
droffs
accompanied
by
several
sniffers
and
stinkfoots
arrived
the
confusion
allowed
ozma
to
use
her
silver
wand
to
cast
a
spell
between
the
forest
monster
elephant
the
stinkfoots
sniffers
and
the
cowardly
lion
the
land
sharks
were
disabled
within
a
matter
of
minutes
those
who
had
not
been
deenergized
by
the
forest
monster
or
otherwise
rendered
harmless
by
one
of
the
others
had
fallen
to
their
spindly
knees
and
were
pleading
for
mercy
one
was
staring
directly
into
the
foot
of
one
of
the
newcomers
and
crying
hysterically
all
the
while
ozma
had
been
using
her
wand
to
turn
the
sharks
into
tiny
snails
which
cubby
picked
up
and
put
into
a
nearby
pond
it
is
finished
said
the
cowardly
lion
he
pushed
his
aching
body
to
the
ground
and
licked
one
of
his
wounds
the
land
sharks
are
subdued
i
do
think
they
will
have
the
same
cruel
spirits
now
that
they
are
snails
indeed
not
said
the
forest
monster
turning
to
the
cowardly
lion
he
added
you
fought
bravely
for
one
who
is
called
cowardly
you
certainly
did
show
any
signs
of
having
earned
that
title
in
this
battle
but
i
felt
them
sighed
the
lion
i
was
only
acting
brave
because
i
saw
my
friends
in
danger
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
scared
out
of
my
wits
the
whole
time
your
friends
echoed
the
forest
monster
you
call
us
your
friends
even
me
do
you
not
remember
who
i
am
and
what
you
once
did
to
me
while
i
was
sleeping
the
lion
did
a
double
take
oh
yeah
i
was
so
caught
up
in
the
battle
with
the
land
sharks
that
i
forgot
what
i
had
come
here
for
i
was
too
agreed
cubby
but
the
cowardly
lion
was
coming
here
to
have
a
talk
with
you
he
added
remembering
the
words
that
the
lion
had
spoken
to
him
earlier
he
said
that
he
was
ashamed
of
what
he
did
to
you
without
giving
you
a
sporting
chance
these
last
words
on
part
were
intended
only
as
an
observation
he
had
no
idea
that
they
would
have
any
effect
on
the
forest
monster
at
all
is
that
so
wondered
the
huge
spider
you
mean
to
say
that
you
came
here
to
apologize
to
me
and
you
even
counted
me
among
your
friends
how
wrong
i
have
been
in
my
assessment
of
your
character
you
are
not
so
cowardly
after
all
in
fact
i
feel
proud
to
have
fought
alongside
of
you
i
would
like
to
start
over
and
get
to
know
you
for
what
you
really
are
the
lion
was
taken
aback
you
would
he
said
he
had
no
idea
what
else
to
say
he
had
come
to
the
lunechien
forest
thinking
that
he
was
to
face
the
greatest
enemy
he
had
ever
known
and
that
enemy
was
speaking
to
him
as
if
they
were
old
friends
who
had
just
met
after
a
long
period
of
separation
of
course
i
would
said
the
spider
i
see
now
that
i
was
wrong
to
hate
you
so
badly
when
i
did
even
know
what
sort
of
fellow
you
really
were
and
seeing
how
i
felt
when
we
were
attacked
by
those
land
sharks
without
having
any
way
to
fight
them
off
showed
me
how
grossly
unfair
i
was
for
having
taken
the
energy
from
helpless
insects
and
animals
i
was
as
bad
as
them
and
i
do
ever
want
to
be
like
that
again
it
much
too
frightful
i
rather
have
a
solid
group
of
friends
than
have
all
the
power
in
the
world
i
think
i
am
guilty
of
the
same
thing
sighed
the
lion
still
a
little
spooked
by
the
abruptness
of
the
monster
turnabout
in
nature
i
knocked
your
head
off
as
you
slept
but
i
did
know
what
you
were
like
either
all
i
knew
was
what
i
was
told
that
you
were
eating
all
of
the
lions
and
the
other
animals
and
that
they
wanted
to
make
me
their
king
if
i
stopped
you
so
you
are
their
king
now
said
the
forest
monster
i
do
not
begrudge
you
the
position
any
more
you
are
welcome
to
it
i
suddenly
feel
like
i
do
care
for
any
position
of
power
any
more
when
i
was
gaining
the
power
i
now
possess
i
was
allowing
myself
to
be
blind
to
anything
but
my
hatred
of
you
now
that
i
see
how
unfounded
that
hatred
really
was
i
feel
that
it
was
i
who
was
the
true
coward
i
was
sapping
the
life
energy
from
countless
helpless
creatures
i
did
not
give
them
any
sporting
chance
either
nor
did
i
have
any
excuse
to
justify
what
i
was
doing
except
that
i
wanted
revenge
it
is
i
who
should
feel
ashamed
of
himself
not
you
now
i
have
all
of
this
power
and
strength
that
was
brought
about
by
my
hate
and
it
is
no
longer
of
any
value
to
me
all
it
has
done
was
to
make
me
all
the
more
angry
and
heartless
if
this
is
the
price
of
strength
i
think
i
rather
be
weak
it
is
far
better
to
be
small
and
have
friends
than
to
have
all
the
strength
in
the
universe
but
be
so
full
of
anger
and
resentment
that
you
ca
even
enjoy
it
so
now
that
you
have
become
a
mountain
of
power
replied
the
lion
you
no
longer
care
to
be
powerful
exactly
sighed
the
forest
monster
if
there
were
a
way
to
reverse
time
and
put
things
back
as
they
should
be
before
i
ever
hurt
anyone
i
would
do
it
i
wish
i
could
apologize
to
all
of
the
poor
animals
that
i
sapped
if
their
spirits
are
still
in
the
vicinity
i
hope
they
see
how
utterly
foolish
i
feel
for
having
taken
such
unfair
advantage
of
them
it
is
very
sad
that
so
many
of
our
friends
and
families
had
to
be
destroyed
in
order
for
you
to
have
learned
this
lesson
said
elephant
thinking
sadly
of
the
loss
to
the
forest
and
its
denizens
but
i
hope
that
you
will
try
to
reverse
your
reputation
now
by
putting
your
strength
to
good
use
it
is
hard
to
forget
what
you
did
but
i
think
that
in
time
we
will
all
be
able
to
accept
you
as
a
neighbor
at
least
if
you
act
like
one
oh
that
i
will
do
said
the
spider
gratefully
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
to
make
up
for
my
past
misbehaving
then
it
seems
we
are
no
longer
needed
said
one
of
the
sniffers
we
met
the
droffs
on
our
way
here
and
they
have
agreed
to
help
us
plow
our
fields
if
our
job
here
is
done
i
think
we
should
like
to
go
home
and
get
started
me
wants
to
plow
fields
said
the
droff
who
stood
beside
him
then
something
positive
did
come
of
all
this
tragedy
said
hootsey
not
only
have
the
sniffers
and
the
stinkfoots
made
friends
with
the
droffs
but
the
forest
monster
has
had
a
change
of
heart
but
can
we
at
least
find
the
empty
shells
of
our
families
and
give
them
a
proper
burial
that
would
be
right
agreed
the
forest
monster
wait
a
minute
said
ozma
you
mean
to
say
that
the
bodies
are
still
around
you
did
devour
them
entirely
no
explained
the
monster
i
only
drained
them
of
their
energy
i
never
actually
hurt
their
physical
bodies
only
their
internal
energy
and
their
energies
are
still
inside
of
you
observed
lisa
catching
on
to
what
ozma
was
getting
at
so
you
never
actually
them
their
bodies
are
still
alive
but
dormant
because
they
have
no
life
energy
that
means
that
if
we
could
reverse
the
process
we
could
put
all
of
their
energy
back
into
their
bodies
again
it
would
agreed
ozma
if
the
forest
monster
would
agree
to
do
this
she
turned
to
the
tremendous
arachnid
it
will
probably
mean
that
you
will
have
to
allow
yourself
to
become
small
again
i
do
mean
as
small
as
you
were
when
the
cowardly
lion
first
met
you
either
i
mean
that
you
will
again
be
reduced
to
the
size
of
a
regular
normal
spider
in
order
to
restore
all
that
you
have
wronged
to
their
former
liveliness
oh
yes
said
the
forest
monster
this
i
will
gladly
do
i
am
happy
to
go
back
to
that
small
size
it
allows
me
to
maintain
a
lower
profile
and
i
would
like
the
opportunity
to
practice
spinning
my
webs
in
private
i
bet
that
in
time
i
will
be
able
to
spin
the
most
gorgeous
webs
you
can
imagine
if
that
comes
to
pass
i
would
consider
it
a
great
honor
if
one
of
my
masterpieces
could
be
coated
in
silver
and
gold
i
should
like
to
give
it
to
your
majesty
as
a
gift
i
would
be
delighted
to
receive
it
i
sure
said
ozma
kindly
though
she
was
not
sure
what
she
would
actually
do
with
such
a
treasure
but
i
think
it
is
now
time
to
restore
the
lunechien
beasts
i
agree
said
the
cowardly
lion
and
as
everything
seems
to
have
come
out
well
i
think
it
is
time
i
head
home
to
the
forest
where
i
am
now
king
i
already
been
away
too
long
as
it
is
of
course
said
ozma
taking
his
paw
in
her
hand
thank
you
for
all
your
help
think
nothing
of
it
my
queen
he
said
then
he
lumbered
off
toward
lion
country
and
now
continued
ozma
back
to
the
job
at
hand
she
put
her
fingertips
to
her
temples
and
concentrated
the
forest
monster
felt
a
slight
tingling
sensation
in
his
heart
but
nothing
else
happened
maybe
you
need
to
use
your
wand
suggested
lisa
or
say
an
incantation
or
make
some
kind
of
magical
motions
put
in
tweaty
no
sighed
ozma
this
operation
is
not
as
basic
as
all
that
the
forest
monster
has
grown
so
vast
that
my
untrained
abilities
are
not
going
to
work
it
may
be
weeks
before
i
will
be
up
to
this
challenge
i
afraid
i
just
not
used
to
being
a
fairy
yet
but
i
think
i
could
do
it
if
i
had
an
anmars
a
what
asked
elephant
i
never
heard
of
an
anmars
before
it
a
standard
magical
tool
that
most
wizards
or
witches
would
have
but
i
do
think
there
are
any
more
witches
in
the
area
allidap
and
her
evil
sister
were
both
destroyed
by
dorothy
and
the
witch
of
the
deep
south
got
rid
of
most
of
her
old
implements
saying
that
they
reminded
her
of
a
time
she
prefer
to
forget
how
about
glinda
suggested
tweaty
who
was
still
in
the
form
of
a
small
orange
pachyderm
she
a
good
witch
you
know
would
she
have
one
of
those
mars
things
an
anmars
corrected
ozma
yes
i
sure
she
would
but
the
last
i
heard
from
her
she
was
going
to
visit
some
place
that
was
having
a
drought
and
try
to
correct
it
a
place
called
yoraitia
i
do
not
know
where
it
is
yoraitia
echoed
tweaty
i
flew
by
there
once
i
know
where
it
is
and
it
is
very
far
from
here
but
there
was
a
dark
and
shadowy
place
on
the
way
i
did
land
there
as
i
thought
it
looked
scary
and
dangerous
but
i
can
lead
you
there
if
you
want
me
to
then
we
are
saved
said
elephant
with
a
loud
trumpet
blast
even
if
that
shadowy
dark
place
is
dangerous
no
one
can
stand
up
to
our
formidable
forest
monster
er
pouted
the
monster
i
rather
not
be
thought
of
that
way
any
more
like
your
witch
of
the
deep
south
there
are
things
that
remind
me
of
a
past
that
i
rather
forget
of
course
said
lisa
i
sure
elephant
did
mean
to
imply
that
you
were
mean
any
more
certainly
not
replied
the
pachyderm
so
can
we
be
on
our
way
i
so
want
to
be
reunited
with
tiger
and
pinky
and
the
others
of
course
replied
the
forest
monster
and
it
is
actually
getting
hard
to
keep
referring
to
him
by
that
title
in
light
of
his
abrupt
change
of
heart
i
have
to
wonder
was
he
ever
really
all
that
monstrous
why
do
you
ride
on
my
back
i
have
very
long
legs
and
it
will
make
the
going
much
faster
they
all
agreed
to
this
plan
and
were
off
to
find
yoraitia
chapter
me
and
my
shadow
it
has
been
mentioned
before
that
although
very
comprehensive
maps
exist
of
oz
there
are
areas
that
are
totally
uncharted
and
about
which
very
little
is
known
one
such
area
is
the
land
of
lost
shadows
in
fact
this
may
be
the
very
first
time
that
this
mysterious
land
has
ever
been
mentioned
by
any
living
human
being
that
is
because
no
one
has
ever
known
where
a
person
shadow
goes
when
he
dies
it
has
always
been
assumed
that
when
someone
physical
form
is
no
more
his
shadow
automatically
disappears
along
with
it
that
is
quite
true
of
course
but
does
anyone
ever
stop
to
think
where
it
disappears
now
it
is
very
true
that
if
you
are
separated
from
your
shadow
when
you
are
alive
it
can
be
sewn
back
on
again
any
child
who
has
ever
read
the
story
of
peter
pan
knows
that
this
is
so
but
when
a
person
body
dies
the
shadow
has
no
desire
to
be
buried
in
the
ground
or
to
be
burned
up
none
of
these
things
bother
the
body
because
it
is
not
aware
of
anything
but
the
shadow
is
totally
aware
and
is
anxious
to
remain
active
and
useful
sometimes
these
shadows
are
helpful
and
good
other
times
the
opposite
is
true
scholars
of
oz
are
already
well
aware
of
the
time
when
the
shadow
of
the
wicked
witch
of
the
east
made
a
ploy
for
revenge
against
the
magical
country
but
no
shadow
can
continue
to
remain
alive
outside
of
the
enchanted
lands
after
all
it
is
but
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
if
you
pardon
the
pun
so
it
just
zips
off
to
oz
to
reside
in
the
land
of
lost
shadows
now
the
word
is
a
misnomer
here
the
shadow
itself
is
anything
but
lost
in
fact
it
is
quite
at
home
in
its
new
abode
however
it
is
lost
as
far
as
the
rest
of
the
world
is
concerned
well
enough
of
these
explanations
let
us
get
back
to
our
story
no
created
beings
other
than
shadows
had
ever
crossed
the
borders
of
shadowland
which
is
the
name
used
by
the
inhabitants
that
is
no
one
had
until
elephant
ozma
tweaty
hootsey
lisa
nibbles
and
the
forest
monster
happened
to
stumble
on
it
by
accident
and
the
way
that
happened
was
as
follows
each
member
of
the
little
band
was
so
preoccupied
with
his
own
thoughts
especially
elephant
he
was
still
thinking
how
close
he
had
come
to
being
eaten
by
the
land
sharks
and
the
miraculous
change
of
heart
on
the
part
of
the
forest
monster
as
for
the
monster
himself
he
was
feeling
bad
about
all
the
evil
things
he
had
done
and
was
contemplating
what
he
would
say
in
apology
to
all
of
the
animals
he
had
wronged
since
it
was
getting
dark
by
this
time
he
failed
to
notice
the
thick
dark
area
looming
up
in
front
of
him
when
crash
he
went
straight
into
it
and
since
it
was
really
dark
now
the
shadowy
occupants
were
quite
invisible
hootsey
suggested
that
there
was
no
point
in
stumbling
around
in
the
dark
and
that
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
for
everyone
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
this
seemed
like
a
fine
idea
to
elephant
who
promptly
flopped
down
on
the
grass
almost
squashing
nibbles
who
was
already
snoozing
under
him
the
forest
monster
also
took
a
position
of
repose
but
far
enough
away
from
his
smaller
charges
that
he
knew
he
would
not
roll
over
and
squish
any
of
them
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
was
fast
asleep
but
it
was
hardly
a
restful
sleep
that
he
experienced
it
was
a
deeply
troubled
sleep
in
his
dreams
he
saw
the
tortured
faces
of
the
many
that
he
had
mistreated
in
his
angry
power
play
the
wispy
night
visions
experienced
by
his
companions
were
hardly
any
more
enjoyable
except
those
of
princess
ozma
who
rated
enough
respect
from
the
sleep
fays
that
they
would
not
allow
any
negative
influences
to
disturb
her
sleep
instead
she
saw
visions
of
the
beautiful
love
fairy
and
the
lilting
laughter
of
the
laughing
fay
these
served
to
make
her
smile
inwardly
as
she
slept
ozma
was
the
first
to
awaken
she
felt
refreshed
and
envigorated
the
sound
of
birds
chirping
and
the
warm
sun
on
her
face
brought
her
out
of
her
deep
restful
slumber
the
first
thing
that
her
eyes
focused
upon
was
a
shadowy
shape
moving
toward
her
along
the
ground
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
shadow
of
an
airplane
would
she
instinctively
looked
up
at
the
sky
to
see
what
flying
object
might
be
casting
its
shadow
on
the
ground
but
there
was
nothing
to
account
for
it
then
she
became
apprehensive
for
it
occurred
to
her
that
perhaps
one
of
the
land
sharks
had
escaped
her
snailifying
spell
and
followed
them
and
that
was
what
she
was
seeing
but
no
it
was
definitely
just
a
shadow
for
it
had
stopped
right
in
front
of
her
then
the
shadow
stood
up
as
it
became
a
human
being
good
morning
said
the
shadow
who
had
now
taken
the
form
of
a
very
ordinary
man
this
awoke
the
others
who
were
surprised
to
see
a
man
in
a
baseball
uniform
forgive
me
for
startling
you
all
said
the
man
but
you
see
when
the
sun
comes
up
high
enough
in
the
sky
we
shadows
resume
the
forms
of
our
previous
selves
in
fact
we
are
identical
to
our
previous
selves
except
that
our
bodies
are
composed
of
molecules
as
opposed
to
the
low
frequency
molecules
of
our
earthly
bodies
seeing
the
quizzical
look
on
everyone
face
he
quickly
continued
it
quite
simple
really
we
are
composed
of
the
same
material
you
are
after
all
none
of
us
could
reside
in
oz
if
we
were
it
makes
sense
when
you
think
about
it
said
ozma
but
i
am
very
curious
as
to
why
you
are
wearing
baseball
clothes
have
you
just
come
from
a
game
yes
i
have
answered
the
man
baseball
is
pretty
big
in
shadowland
you
see
we
have
a
large
population
here
of
old
baseball
players
and
baseball
fans
it
the
biggest
thing
we
all
have
in
common
so
we
tend
to
congregate
together
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
not
only
have
games
between
ourselves
but
we
invite
teams
in
the
united
states
to
visit
when
the
players
are
in
restitude
we
have
a
wonderful
time
together
of
course
the
visiting
players
do
usually
bring
back
the
memory
of
the
games
when
they
awaken
in
the
morning
well
maybe
some
fragmented
dreams
but
that
does
detract
from
the
game
or
the
great
fun
we
have
those
young
whippersnappers
think
they
show
us
old
timers
a
thing
or
two
but
boy
do
they
get
a
run
for
their
money
might
i
inquire
as
to
your
name
questioned
tweaty
rather
timidly
why
yes
came
the
simple
reply
my
name
is
richard
marquard
please
just
call
me
sounds
like
a
backwoodsy
hillbilly
name
to
me
said
elephant
intending
his
words
to
sound
like
friendly
teasing
ha
ha
laughed
rube
equally
friendly
my
nickname
being
what
it
is
you
probably
automatically
assume
that
i
must
have
been
a
country
boy
that
what
most
people
figure
but
it
not
so
fact
is
my
father
was
the
chief
engineer
of
the
city
of
cleveland
and
that
is
where
i
was
born
and
reared
okay
said
elephant
so
then
why
is
it
that
you
are
called
well
it
a
long
story
answered
the
ball
player
shadow
then
we
had
better
not
take
the
time
to
hear
it
all
now
said
hootsey
we
have
a
very
important
mission
to
fulfill
yes
agreed
lisa
but
perhaps
rube
could
help
us
i
think
we
should
bring
him
along
a
grand
idea
exclaimed
ozma
marquard
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
join
us
on
our
mission
i
would
like
to
hear
your
story
and
then
will
be
happy
to
tell
you
ours
illustration
name
is
richard
marquard
please
just
call
me
rube
if
i
had
been
asked
to
join
an
undefined
questing
party
by
any
other
than
the
queen
of
all
oz
i
might
have
hesitated
came
the
reply
but
as
it
is
from
you
i
will
come
along
splendid
said
elephant
then
let
us
be
off
rube
was
lifted
atop
the
forest
monster
as
were
elephant
and
the
others
and
from
this
high
podium
rube
began
his
unique
tale
it
all
started
with
my
father
he
explained
like
i
say
he
was
the
chief
engineer
of
the
city
of
cleveland
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
only
important
thing
was
for
me
to
get
a
good
education
but
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
all
i
could
think
of
morning
noon
and
night
was
baseball
listen
dad
would
say
want
you
to
cut
this
out
and
pay
attention
to
your
studies
i
want
you
to
go
to
college
when
through
high
school
and
i
do
want
any
foolishness
about
it
without
an
education
you
wo
be
able
to
get
a
good
job
and
then
amount
to
anything
already
have
a
job
i
say
got
a
job
what
are
you
talking
about
i
going
to
be
a
ballplayer
i
explain
but
dad
was
not
very
receptive
ballplayer
he
say
throwing
his
hands
up
in
the
air
do
you
mean
how
can
you
make
a
living
as
a
ballplayer
i
do
understand
why
a
grown
man
would
wear
those
suits
in
the
first
place
i
answer
see
policemen
with
uniforms
on
and
other
people
like
that
they
change
after
they
through
working
it
the
same
way
with
ballplayers
that
sounds
reasonable
to
me
said
tweaty
me
too
said
queen
ozma
i
certainly
do
wear
the
same
clothes
to
a
meeting
with
a
foreign
dignitary
as
i
would
wear
while
playing
marbles
with
jellia
jamb
certainly
not
agreed
nibbles
if
only
my
father
had
thought
that
way
sighed
rube
shadow
but
he
just
scoffed
ballplayers
get
paid
he
ask
i
told
him
get
paid
do
believe
it
he
would
rant
and
and
we
would
go
we
actually
have
that
same
argument
almost
always
at
least
once
a
week
twice
a
week
in
the
summer
sometimes
my
grandfather
my
father
father
would
get
involved
in
it
my
grandfather
was
a
nice
man
who
liked
baseball
and
he
would
usually
take
my
side
he
say
to
my
father
you
were
a
youngster
i
wanted
you
to
be
something
too
i
wanted
you
to
be
a
stonecutter
same
as
i
was
when
i
came
over
from
the
old
country
oh
did
i
mention
before
that
my
grandfather
was
a
stonecutter
no
replied
elephant
you
just
said
that
he
was
a
nice
man
who
liked
baseball
okay
said
rube
shadow
well
my
grandfather
had
been
a
stonecutter
and
had
tried
to
persuade
dad
to
become
one
too
no
he
would
say
loudly
into
my
father
ear
would
listen
you
wanted
to
be
an
engineer
so
you
an
engineer
and
a
darned
good
one
too
had
i
forced
you
into
masonry
you
would
never
have
excelled
in
the
craft
for
which
you
had
no
love
and
you
would
have
been
very
unhappy
now
richard
wants
to
be
a
baseball
player
he
so
determined
that
nothing
is
going
to
stop
him
let
give
him
a
chance
and
see
what
he
can
do
do
force
the
boy
to
give
up
on
his
dreams
your
grandfather
sounds
like
a
wise
man
to
me
said
ozma
he
was
said
the
shadow
but
dad
would
never
listen
are
no
good
he
insist
are
no
good
and
they
never
will
be
any
good
it
was
very
frustrating
he
would
usually
end
the
argument
by
slamming
the
door
and
going
outside
to
sit
on
the
porch
and
he
would
stop
speaking
to
my
grandfather
or
me
for
hours
at
a
time
that
too
bad
said
tweaty
if
you
were
good
at
baseball
you
should
have
stuck
with
it
but
i
did
stick
with
it
replied
the
shadow
i
told
you
i
just
came
from
a
game
oh
yeah
said
tweaty
so
you
mean
you
brought
your
dad
around
well
the
shadow
said
slowly
the
thing
is
i
was
always
very
tall
for
my
age
i
had
three
brothers
and
a
sister
and
my
sister
was
the
shortest
of
the
five
of
us
she
grew
to
be
six
feet
two
so
you
see
i
was
constantly
hanging
around
the
older
kids
and
playing
ball
with
them
instead
of
hanging
with
kids
my
own
age
when
i
was
about
thirteen
or
so
i
used
to
carry
bats
for
some
of
the
cleveland
indians
such
as
elmer
flick
napoleon
lajoie
and
terry
turner
of
course
they
were
not
called
the
cleveland
indians
then
they
were
called
the
cleveland
bronchos
in
those
days
then
the
cleveland
naps
after
napoleon
lajoie
anyway
after
the
regular
season
was
over
a
lot
of
them
would
barnstorm
around
the
cleveland
area
and
sometimes
i
be
their
bat
boy
later
on
i
even
pitched
a
few
games
for
bill
bradley
boo
gang
the
shadow
added
proudly
boo
gang
said
lisa
with
a
little
shudder
boo
like
a
ghost
added
hootsey
no
no
laughed
rube
image
bill
bradley
was
the
third
baseman
for
the
cleveland
indians
and
one
of
the
greatest
who
ever
lived
and
he
also
barnstormed
with
his
gang
after
the
season
was
over
so
by
the
time
i
was
fifteen
or
so
i
knew
a
lot
of
ballplayers
and
i
had
my
heart
set
on
being
a
big
leaguer
myself
well
one
of
my
best
friends
was
a
catcher
named
howard
wakefield
he
was
about
five
years
older
than
i
was
in
he
was
playing
for
the
waterloo
club
in
the
iowa
state
league
and
echoed
lisa
but
but
what
wrong
asked
the
ballplayer
shadow
you
have
to
be
mistaken
said
elephant
recognizing
the
reason
for
his
friend
perplexity
it
is
yet
it
only
i
think
he
from
the
future
said
lisa
rube
marquard
is
from
a
year
that
has
happened
yet
but
how
is
that
possible
asked
hootsey
have
you
ever
noticed
explained
the
shadow
how
you
can
stand
in
the
middle
of
two
or
more
different
sources
of
light
and
cast
several
shadows
in
various
directions
of
course
said
hootsey
and
sometimes
i
have
a
long
skinny
shadow
that
is
faint
and
grayish
while
i
also
have
a
short
fat
shadow
right
under
me
which
is
almost
completely
black
and
when
i
flying
i
can
make
lots
of
different
shadows
that
do
even
touch
me
anywhere
yes
said
rube
and
these
are
all
your
shadow
if
you
go
on
a
stage
with
many
footlights
you
will
cast
various
images
of
various
shades
of
gray
these
are
all
your
shadow
you
see
your
shadow
can
go
in
any
direction
backward
or
forward
it
can
reach
to
a
distant
area
or
stay
situated
close
by
and
it
can
do
all
at
one
time
without
ever
letting
go
of
you
even
if
as
you
say
it
is
actually
touching
you
you
are
always
attached
at
some
place
as
the
shadow
of
rube
marquard
i
touch
him
always
even
while
he
is
far
away
in
repose
i
can
be
his
past
his
future
or
his
mirror
image
that
is
why
i
can
remember
experiences
he
has
even
had
yet
sometimes
we
shadows
accidentally
create
a
feeling
of
deja
vu
in
our
live
counterparts
which
can
lead
to
a
false
sense
of
psychic
ability
i
do
know
much
about
american
sports
figures
said
elephant
but
it
sounds
like
you
are
someone
who
is
or
will
be
important
to
baseball
but
how
did
you
convince
your
dad
to
let
you
play
yes
agreed
hootsey
you
still
have
told
us
of
course
replied
the
shadow
as
i
was
saying
i
had
a
friend
by
the
name
of
howard
wakefield
he
was
playing
for
the
waterloo
club
in
the
iowa
state
league
that
summer
when
i
was
only
sixteen
i
got
a
letter
from
him
can
use
a
good
the
letter
said
if
you
want
to
come
to
waterloo
i
recommend
you
to
the
i
think
howard
thought
that
i
was
at
least
eighteen
or
nineteen
as
i
was
so
big
for
my
age
i
wrote
howard
and
told
him
that
my
dad
did
not
want
me
to
play
ball
so
i
did
think
he
give
me
the
money
to
go
if
i
asked
him
probably
hit
the
ceiling
and
rap
me
over
the
head
with
something
aside
from
that
i
was
ready
to
go
well
said
lisa
indignantly
a
good
father
would
have
encouraged
you
to
go
he
should
have
been
able
to
see
that
you
were
good
at
what
you
did
and
that
you
deserved
this
chance
to
make
good
absolutely
agreed
hootsey
but
i
do
expect
that
your
father
gave
you
the
money
did
you
ever
get
to
waterloo
well
answered
the
shadow
pretty
soon
i
got
a
telegram
from
the
waterloo
manager
he
said
that
i
had
been
recommended
very
highly
by
howard
wakefield
and
asked
if
i
would
like
to
come
and
try
out
for
the
team
the
waterloo
manager
offered
to
reimburse
the
cost
of
transportation
if
i
was
given
a
contract
but
you
still
could
get
the
money
from
your
father
said
ozma
no
sighed
the
ballplayer
it
was
hardly
an
improvement
over
letter
so
i
just
went
upstairs
to
my
room
and
closed
the
door
then
i
wrote
back
a
long
letter
to
the
waterloo
manager
explaining
that
i
did
have
any
money
for
transportation
but
i
told
him
that
if
he
sent
me
an
advance
right
now
for
transportation
i
be
on
the
very
next
train
to
waterloo
and
he
could
take
it
out
of
my
salary
later
on
that
assuming
you
were
hired
of
course
said
lisa
yes
agreed
rube
but
i
did
have
the
slightest
doubt
that
i
would
make
good
and
of
course
i
did
mention
that
i
was
only
sixteen
years
old
i
thought
it
best
to
leave
that
out
i
mailed
the
letter
to
iowa
and
then
i
waited
on
pins
and
needles
for
an
answer
every
day
i
had
to
be
the
first
one
to
get
at
the
mail
because
if
anyone
else
saw
a
letter
to
me
from
the
waterloo
ball
club
well
that
would
have
been
enough
to
alert
dad
to
what
was
going
on
and
i
have
been
sunk
so
every
day
i
waited
for
the
first
sign
of
the
mailman
and
tried
to
get
to
him
before
he
reached
the
house
as
it
turned
out
i
could
have
saved
myself
a
lot
of
worrying
no
letter
ever
came
guessed
lisa
nope
three
weeks
passed
and
still
no
answer
the
shadow
sighed
again
i
could
understand
what
had
gone
wrong
maybe
it
was
against
the
rules
to
send
transportation
money
to
somebody
not
yet
under
contract
maybe
they
did
know
how
good
i
really
was
maybe
this
and
maybe
that
it
was
another
frustrating
period
of
my
life
finally
i
just
stand
it
any
longer
i
gave
my
folks
a
story
about
camping
with
the
boy
scouts
and
to
waterloo
you
lied
to
your
parents
said
ozma
startled
by
the
very
idea
yes
i
did
it
was
a
hard
thing
for
me
to
do
going
against
dad
like
that
but
i
was
well
punished
for
the
deed
believe
me
have
you
ever
had
to
sleep
in
open
fields
or
hop
a
freight
train
it
took
me
five
days
and
five
nights
the
longest
five
days
of
my
life
and
i
was
only
sixteen
at
the
time
but
i
did
get
there
tired
anxious
and
i
blew
into
the
illinois
central
station
at
waterloo
iowa
on
a
freight
train
early
in
the
evening
just
before
it
stopped
i
jumped
off
and
went
head
over
heels
right
in
front
of
the
passenger
house
i
hardly
had
time
to
pick
myself
up
off
the
ground
before
the
stationmaster
grabbed
me
and
shouted
do
you
think
you
doing
come
on
get
out
of
here
before
i
run
you
in
i
said
reporting
to
the
waterloo
ball
club
what
he
says
god
did
you
ever
wash
your
face
i
did
i
said
i
been
travelling
for
five
days
and
five
nights
and
i
am
anxious
to
get
to
the
ball
park
where
do
the
ballplayers
hang
around
the
smoke
shop
he
says
the
street
about
a
half
of
a
mile
if
you
walk
down
there
probably
whoever
you
looking
for
will
be
there
so
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
see
to
it
that
he
got
a
free
pass
to
the
ball
game
as
soon
as
i
got
settled
and
started
off
for
the
smoke
shop
it
turned
out
that
two
brothers
owned
the
smoke
shop
and
they
also
owned
the
ball
club
one
of
them
was
behind
the
counter
when
i
walked
into
the
place
he
took
one
look
at
me
and
let
out
a
roar
like
a
lion
are
you
doing
in
here
he
yelled
this
is
a
respectable
place
get
out
of
here
a
minute
i
says
got
a
telegram
from
the
manager
of
the
ball
club
to
report
here
and
if
i
make
good
i
get
a
contract
you
kidding
he
says
in
the
world
ever
recommended
you
wakefield
did
i
said
says
the
guy
behind
the
counter
is
in
back
shooting
billiards
we
soon
settle
this
i
like
to
go
back
and
see
him
i
said
you
go
back
there
he
shouted
even
think
about
going
back
there
you
drive
everybody
out
did
you
ever
take
a
bath
course
i
did
says
i
i
bummed
my
way
here
and
i
had
a
chance
to
clean
up
yet
so
he
goes
into
the
back
and
in
a
minute
howard
comes
out
he
says
happened
to
you
i
was
explaining
it
to
him
when
in
came
frisbee
the
manager
and
i
was
introduced
to
him
received
your
telegram
i
said
have
enough
money
to
come
first
class
or
anything
like
that
but
here
i
am
is
here
tomorrow
says
the
manager
we
pitch
you
pitch
you
echoed
hootsey
what
a
mean
thing
for
him
to
say
imagine
just
pitching
you
out
after
all
your
effort
to
get
there
no
no
explained
the
shadow
he
meant
that
he
wanted
me
to
pitch
the
next
day
but
i
was
all
tuckered
out
and
hardly
ready
to
do
that
i
really
wanted
to
have
a
bath
and
get
some
sleep
or
never
young
fellow
he
says
to
me
tomorrow
or
not
at
all
right
i
said
could
i
have
five
dollars
in
advance
so
i
can
get
a
clean
shirt
or
something
the
game
tomorrow
he
said
then
he
just
walked
away
from
me
like
i
was
nothing
how
rude
said
elephant
the
least
he
could
have
done
would
have
been
to
let
you
take
a
shower
in
the
said
lisa
well
i
got
to
clean
up
admitted
rube
howard
took
me
to
his
rooming
house
and
gave
me
something
to
eat
they
let
me
sleep
on
an
extra
cot
they
had
and
the
next
day
we
went
to
the
ball
park
and
i
was
introduced
to
the
players
and
given
a
uniform
that
was
too
small
for
me
the
keokuk
team
was
shagging
balls
while
i
warmed
up
and
they
kept
making
comments
about
green
rookies
and
bushers
and
nitchies
and
such
and
how
knock
me
out
of
the
box
in
the
first
inning
and
how
i
should
have
stayed
home
with
my
mommy
ooh
i
felt
terrible
i
had
an
awful
headache
and
i
was
exhausted
still
i
was
determined
to
show
them
that
i
could
make
good
and
i
went
out
there
and
won
that
game
six
against
one
with
that
continued
the
shadow
i
felt
sure
i
be
offered
a
contract
so
after
the
game
i
went
to
frisbee
and
said
i
showed
you
i
could
deliver
the
goods
can
we
talk
about
a
contract
now
he
says
to
me
is
in
last
place
wait
until
oskaloosa
comes
in
this
weekend
they
are
in
second
place
they
are
a
rough
team
and
if
you
can
beat
them
then
we
talk
i
get
any
money
any
advance
money
on
my
contract
i
asked
him
have
got
a
contract
he
said
right
says
i
and
i
did
say
another
word
i
knew
that
he
was
right
i
have
to
prove
myself
before
i
could
expect
any
handouts
from
this
man
so
i
stayed
quiet
i
did
say
anything
to
anybody
that
evening
but
when
it
got
dark
i
went
down
to
the
railway
station
and
the
same
stationmaster
was
there
he
remembered
me
he
says
pitched
a
fine
game
today
i
was
there
and
you
did
a
great
job
what
are
you
doing
back
here
did
you
come
to
give
me
that
free
ticket
you
promised
me
i
said
to
him
sadly
i
sorry
i
going
back
home
to
cleveland
and
i
want
to
know
what
time
a
freight
comes
by
then
i
explained
to
him
about
everything
that
had
happened
oh
he
was
very
nice
to
me
he
completely
understood
where
i
was
coming
from
after
we
had
talked
for
awhile
he
said
the
train
comes
in
at
one
in
the
morning
and
the
engine
unhooks
and
goes
down
to
the
water
tower
when
it
does
you
sneak
into
the
baggage
compartment
meanwhile
i
talk
to
the
baggage
man
before
the
engine
gets
hooked
up
again
so
when
the
train
pulls
out
and
is
about
five
miles
out
of
town
he
open
the
baggage
door
and
let
you
out
and
that
is
pretty
much
what
happened
continued
rube
when
we
were
five
miles
out
of
town
the
door
opened
and
the
baggage
man
appeared
i
talked
with
him
all
the
way
to
chicago
and
as
we
got
close
to
the
yards
he
says
to
me
you
better
get
ready
to
jump
now
there
are
a
lot
of
detectives
around
here
and
if
you
not
careful
they
jump
on
you
and
throw
you
in
jail
so
once
you
get
to
the
ground
do
not
hesitate
beat
it
away
from
here
as
fast
as
you
can
the
baggage
man
must
have
told
the
engineer
about
me
as
we
slowed
down
to
a
crawl
just
before
we
approached
the
chicago
yards
and
off
i
jumped
i
got
out
of
there
quick
and
took
off
down
the
street
i
know
what
street
it
was
and
i
not
sure
where
i
was
headed
but
i
do
remember
that
i
was
awfully
tired
it
was
the
middle
of
the
morning
and
i
had
hardly
slept
a
wink
the
night
before
i
had
staggered
about
three
or
four
blocks
when
i
passed
by
a
fire
engine
house
evidently
all
of
the
firemen
were
out
at
a
fire
because
the
place
was
deserted
i
was
tired
very
tired
so
i
went
in
and
sat
down
well
they
had
a
big
bellied
iron
stove
in
there
and
it
was
warm
i
guess
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
as
the
next
thing
i
knew
a
couple
of
firemen
were
shaking
me
and
doing
everything
they
could
do
to
wake
me
up
they
called
me
a
bum
and
a
lot
of
other
bad
names
and
told
me
to
get
out
of
there
or
have
me
thrown
in
jail
no
bum
i
said
a
ballplayer
the
firemen
laughed
a
ballplayer
where
did
you
ever
play
cleveland
around
the
sandlots
i
told
them
proudly
in
waterloo
iowa
too
i
beat
the
keokuk
team
six
to
one
said
one
of
the
firemen
last
week
i
had
dinner
with
santa
claus
and
the
pope
so
i
suppose
you
going
to
tell
me
that
you
are
close
buddies
with
brown
chance
tinker
and
evans
i
mean
evers
and
all
of
those
fellows
i
said
do
know
them
but
some
day
i
be
playing
with
them
or
against
them
because
i
going
to
get
in
the
big
leagues
are
you
going
now
asked
the
firemen
home
to
cleveland
i
told
them
you
got
any
money
they
asked
me
i
answered
i
had
to
be
honest
after
all
so
they
got
up
a
little
pool
of
about
five
dollars
and
said
on
your
way
and
use
this
to
get
something
to
eat
i
thanked
them
and
as
i
left
i
told
them
that
some
day
i
would
be
back
again
i
get
to
the
big
leagues
i
said
i
coming
out
to
visit
you
when
we
get
to
chicago
and
home
i
went
i
played
around
home
all
the
rest
of
the
summer
and
then
the
next
summer
that
would
have
been
if
i
recall
correctly
even
though
i
remembering
things
that
have
yet
to
happen
and
remembering
them
backwards
i
took
a
job
with
an
ice
cream
company
in
cleveland
i
made
dollars
a
week
fifteen
for
checking
the
cans
on
the
truck
that
would
take
the
ice
cream
away
and
ten
dollars
a
sunday
when
i
pitched
for
the
company
team
it
was
a
good
team
we
played
the
best
semipro
clubs
in
the
cleveland
area
and
i
beat
them
all
i
was
only
seventeen
but
i
hardly
lost
a
game
then
one
day
i
got
a
postal
card
from
the
cleveland
ball
club
asking
me
to
come
in
and
talk
to
them
kilfoyl
and
somers
the
owners
of
the
club
wanted
to
see
me
hurray
said
hootsey
so
then
your
father
must
have
come
around
by
then
hardly
said
the
shadow
my
dad
saw
the
postal
card
and
became
very
upset
he
said
to
me
see
that
you
still
want
to
be
a
ballplayer
i
admitted
do
and
i
going
to
be
a
great
one
too
just
you
wait
and
see
some
day
you
going
to
be
proud
of
me
he
shrugged
of
nothing
but
i
went
to
the
cleveland
club
office
all
the
same
and
kilfoyl
and
somers
were
both
there
i
told
them
that
i
had
received
their
card
know
i
added
got
me
into
a
little
jam
my
dad
want
me
to
be
a
ballplayer
you
worry
said
kilfoyl
you
sign
with
us
and
get
into
the
big
leagues
he
think
differently
about
it
i
said
not
signing
with
you
or
anybody
else
until
i
hear
what
you
offering
i
been
taken
advantage
of
before
and
it
not
going
to
happen
again
i
know
a
lot
of
ballplayers
and
they
always
tell
me
not
to
sign
with
anybody
unless
i
get
a
good
salary
they
all
tell
me
you
better
get
it
when
you
young
you
sure
wo
get
it
when
you
old
a
lot
of
nonsense
kilfoyl
said
you
worry
treat
you
right
we
give
you
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
that
a
wonderful
offer
think
he
be
overpaid
somers
says
do
think
that
is
so
wonderful
i
said
as
for
being
overpaid
i
get
that
much
right
now
from
the
ice
cream
company
and
in
addition
i
get
to
eat
all
the
ice
cream
i
want
so
it
really
was
an
honorable
offer
tsked
ozma
did
they
raise
their
offer
no
replied
the
shadow
with
a
sad
expression
they
would
increase
their
price
and
i
would
reduce
mine
so
i
left
and
went
home
on
my
way
home
though
i
stopped
in
this
store
at
prospect
avenue
it
was
owned
by
bill
bradley
and
ryan
phylli
i
mean
charlie
carr
charlie
managed
and
played
first
base
for
indianapolis
in
the
american
association
bill
as
i
think
i
may
have
mentioned
before
played
third
base
for
cleveland
anyway
when
i
walked
in
the
door
bill
bradley
said
big
leaguer
i
understand
that
the
boss
wants
to
sign
you
up
me
i
said
would
pay
me
as
much
as
i
already
make
with
the
ice
cream
company
know
said
charlie
carr
manage
the
indianapolis
club
know
that
i
said
after
all
everybody
knew
that
would
you
like
to
sign
with
me
charlie
said
with
a
smile
in
the
minor
leagues
i
replied
a
major
league
club
pay
me
what
i
want
how
could
you
do
it
much
do
you
want
he
wanted
to
know
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
then
answered
hundred
a
month
he
said
want
all
the
money
do
you
i
told
him
you
want
a
good
pitcher
do
you
he
answered
simply
i
said
i
one
the
five
ozites
laughed
at
this
and
the
shadow
smiled
he
was
actually
beginning
to
fear
that
he
was
giving
them
too
many
details
and
that
his
story
may
be
becoming
and
dull
but
seeing
that
he
was
not
boring
his
listeners
he
continued
he
agreed
to
my
terms
of
course
so
right
then
i
signed
my
first
professional
contract
with
indianapolis
of
the
american
association
when
i
got
home
that
night
i
had
to
tell
my
dad
about
it
because
i
was
to
leave
for
indianapolis
the
very
next
day
oh
that
was
a
terrible
night
finally
dad
said
listen
i
told
you
time
and
time
again
that
i
do
want
you
to
be
a
professional
ballplayer
but
you
got
your
mind
made
up
now
i
going
to
tell
you
something
when
you
cross
that
threshold
do
come
back
i
do
ever
want
to
see
you
again
no
said
ozma
with
a
start
no
way
no
father
would
say
such
a
thing
to
his
own
son
that
was
just
what
my
father
said
to
me
said
rube
sadly
he
want
me
to
come
home
again
i
was
excommunicated
from
the
family
that
awful
said
lisa
parents
do
have
a
certain
responsibility
toward
any
children
that
they
brought
into
the
world
he
was
a
skinflint
and
a
creep
yes
agreed
rube
his
actions
that
day
were
like
those
of
a
regular
skunk
i
known
some
very
nice
skunks
in
my
day
said
hootsey
in
any
case
said
the
shadow
not
wanting
to
get
into
a
debate
about
his
use
of
the
word
i
was
as
shocked
as
you
all
seem
to
be
do
mean
that
dad
i
said
i
do
i
replied
going
and
some
day
you
be
proud
of
me
he
said
breaking
my
heart
and
i
do
ever
want
to
see
you
again
will
not
break
your
heart
i
said
add
more
years
to
your
life
you
wait
and
see
and
so
it
was
that
i
went
to
indianapolis
they
optioned
me
out
to
canton
in
the
central
league
for
the
rest
of
the
season
and
i
won
games
with
them
which
was
of
all
the
games
the
canton
club
won
that
year
good
for
you
rube
said
elephant
genuinely
proud
of
his
new
friend
the
next
year
that
would
have
been
i
went
to
spring
training
with
the
indianapolis
club
we
went
to
french
lick
springs
indiana
after
three
weeks
there
we
went
back
to
indianapolis
and
played
a
few
exhibition
games
before
the
season
opened
well
believe
it
or
not
the
first
club
to
come
in
for
an
exhibition
game
was
the
cleveland
team
napoleon
lajoie
terry
turner
elmer
flick
george
stovall
and
the
whole
bunch
that
i
used
to
carry
bats
for
when
they
came
on
the
field
i
was
already
warming
up
a
couple
of
them
yelled
at
me
are
you
doing
here
are
you
the
bat
boy
here
i
smugly
replied
am
the
pitcher
a
pitcher
they
jeered
do
you
think
you
kidding
ask
bill
bradley
i
told
them
was
there
when
i
signed
my
first
contract
you
see
i
going
to
pitch
against
you
guys
today
and
i
going
to
beat
you
too
us
busher
you
could
beat
a
drum
so
then
bill
bradley
came
over
and
said
hello
as
he
was
leaving
he
said
you
a
nice
boy
so
i
want
to
give
you
some
advice
before
today
game
be
careful
of
the
frenchman
he
meant
napoleon
lajoie
he
said
the
frenchman
is
very
sharp
and
he
been
hitting
terrific
line
drives
this
past
week
he
almost
killed
three
of
our
own
pitchers
in
practice
so
there
no
telling
what
he
do
in
a
real
game
even
if
it
is
just
an
exhibition
game
i
thanked
him
of
course
and
went
back
to
warming
up
well
i
pitched
the
whole
nine
innings
and
beat
them
two
to
zero
lajoie
got
two
hits
off
me
and
i
think
george
stovall
got
a
couple
but
i
shut
them
out
and
i
was
killed
either
that
night
charlie
carr
called
me
over
know
he
said
funny
thing
just
happened
somers
the
owner
of
the
cleveland
club
just
came
over
to
my
hotel
room
and
wanted
to
buy
you
he
offered
me
three
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
for
your
contract
with
the
understanding
that
you
stay
here
all
season
to
get
more
experience
and
then
you
would
join
the
cleveland
club
next
year
i
said
you
sell
me
to
somers
i
going
right
back
to
the
ice
cream
company
he
had
first
chance
to
get
me
and
he
give
me
what
i
deserved
so
long
as
somers
is
involved
i
wo
play
for
cleveland
no
matter
what
he
said
worry
i
wo
sell
you
later
on
i
be
able
to
sell
you
for
a
lot
more
anyway
on
opening
day
kansas
city
was
at
indianapolis
and
i
pitched
the
opening
game
i
won
two
to
one
and
that
evening
the
story
in
the
indianapolis
read
like
this
american
association
season
opened
up
today
and
it
was
a
beautiful
game
between
two
fine
teams
each
had
great
pitching
with
an
eighteen
year
old
pitching
for
kansas
city
and
an
eighteen
year
old
for
the
home
team
the
with
kansas
city
looks
like
he
going
to
develop
into
a
great
pitcher
they
call
him
smoky
joe
wood
but
we
have
a
with
indianapolis
who
is
going
places
too
he
resembles
one
of
the
great
pitchers
of
all
time
rube
waddell
and
from
that
day
on
they
nicknamed
me
i
had
a
wonderful
season
that
year
with
indianapolis
i
pitched
complete
games
won
of
them
led
the
league
in
most
strikeouts
least
hits
most
innings
pitched
and
everything
occasionally
what
i
do
would
be
reported
in
the
cleveland
papers
and
friends
of
mine
would
tell
me
that
they
pass
by
the
house
and
see
dad
sitting
on
the
porch
fred
they
say
that
was
dad
name
by
the
way
fred
you
see
what
your
son
rube
did
yesterday
are
you
talking
about
he
say
who
son
richard
they
would
answer
told
him
that
baseball
was
no
good
my
dad
would
reply
they
even
gone
and
changed
his
name
anyway
i
had
a
terrific
year
with
indianapolis
like
i
said
late
in
the
season
we
went
into
columbus
ohio
and
charlie
carr
came
up
to
me
before
the
game
he
said
are
going
to
be
an
awful
lot
of
celebrities
here
at
the
game
today
the
american
and
national
leagues
both
have
an
and
they
all
coming
to
see
you
pitch
if
you
pitch
a
good
game
i
may
be
able
to
sell
you
before
the
night
is
out
how
much
i
wanted
to
know
do
know
he
said
a
lot
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
game
you
pitch
you
cut
me
in
i
asked
i
wo
he
said
with
certainty
getting
a
good
salary
and
you
know
it
i
said
i
was
only
kidding
anyway
do
want
you
to
get
nervous
today
he
said
i
repeated
i
ever
been
nervous
all
season
he
admitted
been
in
baseball
a
long
time
and
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
i
never
saw
a
kid
like
you
who
can
beat
anybody
and
is
so
successful
i
said
reason
i
so
successful
is
because
i
can
beat
anybody
now
are
you
getting
a
little
carried
away
with
your
bragging
asked
nibbles
i
mean
i
very
much
enjoying
your
story
even
though
i
know
little
about
baseball
except
that
you
play
it
on
a
bass
drum
but
really
i
think
you
carrying
your
pride
a
little
too
far
into
the
negative
yeah
admitted
rube
i
am
sorry
about
that
sometimes
that
happens
to
me
when
i
get
too
worked
up
anyway
i
went
out
there
that
day
and
i
pitched
one
of
those
unusual
games
no
hits
no
runs
no
errors
men
faced
me
and
not
one
of
them
got
to
first
base
and
that
evening
in
columbus
they
put
me
up
for
sale
with
all
the
big
league
clubs
bidding
on
me
like
a
horse
being
auctioned
off
the
cleveland
club
went
as
high
as
ten
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
for
my
contract
but
the
giants
went
to
eleven
grand
and
i
was
sold
to
them
at
that
time
that
was
the
highest
price
ever
paid
for
a
baseball
player
i
reported
to
the
new
york
giants
in
september
of
as
soon
as
the
american
association
season
was
over
i
was
eigh
it
still
feels
a
little
odd
to
have
you
things
from
years
that
have
not
yet
been
interrupted
hootsey
let
him
finish
the
story
admonished
elephant
i
am
sorry
said
rube
but
it
is
a
memory
to
me
and
a
prediction
to
you
i
will
try
to
be
more
careful
about
naming
years
if
i
can
remember
to
be
but
in
any
event
i
was
eighteen
years
old
at
the
time
and
already
the
most
valuable
player
in
the
big
leagues
excuse
me
if
i
seem
to
boast
but
i
feel
that
i
am
justified
this
time
i
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
still
i
came
up
too
late
in
the
season
to
make
a
trip
to
chicago
with
the
giants
that
year
but
the
next
season
we
made
our
first
trip
to
chicago
the
second
week
in
june
and
the
first
thing
i
did
as
soon
as
i
got
there
was
to
make
a
beeline
for
that
firehouse
the
only
one
there
when
i
first
got
there
was
the
lieutenant
i
walked
up
to
him
and
said
do
you
remember
me
saw
you
before
in
my
life
he
said
remember
about
three
years
ago
you
caught
me
sleeping
back
of
that
stove
there
are
you
that
kid
from
cleveland
that
said
he
a
ballplayer
i
told
him
me
my
name
is
marquard
richard
marquard
course
he
said
not
really
interested
are
you
doing
here
am
in
the
big
leagues
i
explained
told
you
when
i
got
to
the
big
leagues
i
was
coming
out
to
visit
you
i
be
he
began
then
are
you
with
i
with
the
new
york
giants
i
said
with
pride
and
boy
for
years
after
that
whenever
the
giants
would
come
to
chicago
i
go
out
to
that
firehouse
i
sit
out
front
and
talk
for
hours
the
firemen
would
have
all
the
kids
in
the
neighborhood
there
and
all
the
families
that
lived
around
would
stop
by
and
it
was
really
wonderful
everybody
was
so
nice
and
friendly
gee
i
used
to
enjoy
that
it
was
a
great
thrill
for
me
actually
every
single
day
of
all
the
years
i
spent
in
the
big
leagues
was
a
thrill
for
me
it
was
like
a
dream
come
true
i
was
in
the
big
leagues
for
eighteen
years
you
know
from
through
oh
yeah
sorry
about
that
i
was
with
the
giants
for
seven
glorious
years
with
the
dodgers
for
five
years
after
that
with
cincinnati
for
one
year
and
then
with
the
boston
braves
for
four
and
i
loved
every
single
minute
of
it
the
best
years
of
all
were
those
with
the
giants
i
do
mean
because
those
were
my
best
pitching
years
although
they
were
in
i
won
games
and
lost
only
seven
and
in
i
won
that
the
year
i
won
nineteen
straight
i
did
lose
a
single
game
in
until
july
eighth
actually
at
the
risk
of
sounding
boastful
again
i
won
twenty
straight
not
nineteen
but
because
of
the
way
they
scored
then
i
did
get
credit
for
one
of
them
i
relieved
jeff
tesreau
in
the
eighth
inning
of
a
game
one
day
with
the
giants
behind
three
to
two
in
the
ninth
inning
heinie
groh
singled
and
art
wilson
homered
and
we
won
four
to
three
but
they
gave
tesreau
credit
for
the
victory
instead
of
me
except
for
that
it
would
have
been
twenty
straight
wins
not
nineteen
it
still
a
pretty
magnificent
record
harumphed
elephant
i
see
any
reason
for
all
the
sour
grapes
oh
no
said
rube
shadow
no
sour
grapes
it
was
the
grandest
year
of
my
life
of
course
i
had
other
great
years
with
the
giants
too
in
er
sorry
i
just
told
this
story
this
way
for
so
long
it
is
hard
to
change
it
now
i
beat
babe
adams
and
the
pirates
in
a
inning
game
three
to
one
both
of
us
went
the
entire
distance
that
day
all
innings
and
the
following
year
i
pitched
a
against
brooklyn
and
beat
nap
rucker
two
to
nothing
no
wonder
you
remember
your
years
with
the
giants
best
said
hootsey
understandingly
oh
no
said
rube
but
that
not
the
reason
the
real
reason
is
well
maybe
it
because
that
was
my
first
club
i
do
know
whatever
the
reason
though
it
was
wonderful
to
be
a
giant
back
then
take
mcgraw
for
example
what
a
great
man
he
was
the
finest
and
grandest
man
i
ever
met
he
loved
his
players
and
his
players
loved
him
of
course
he
would
stand
for
any
nonsense
you
had
to
live
up
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
new
york
giants
and
when
he
laid
down
the
law
you
better
abide
by
it
i
never
forget
one
day
we
were
playing
pittsburgh
and
it
was
red
murray
turn
to
bat
with
the
score
tied
in
the
ninth
inning
there
was
a
man
on
second
with
none
out
murray
came
over
to
mcgraw
i
was
sitting
next
to
mcgraw
on
the
bench
and
he
said
do
you
want
me
to
do
mac
do
i
want
you
to
do
mcgraw
said
are
you
doing
in
the
national
league
there
the
winning
run
on
second
base
and
no
one
out
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
the
manager
sacrifice
the
man
to
third
murray
said
mcgraw
said
exactly
what
i
want
you
to
do
so
murray
went
up
to
the
plate
to
bunt
after
he
got
to
the
box
though
he
backed
out
and
looked
over
at
mcgraw
again
mcgraw
poked
his
elbow
in
my
ribs
at
that
he
said
told
me
what
he
should
do
and
i
told
him
what
he
should
do
and
now
he
undecided
i
bet
he
forgot
from
the
bench
to
the
plate
now
in
those
days
and
i
guess
it
the
same
now
when
a
man
was
up
there
to
bunt
the
pitcher
would
try
to
keep
the
ball
high
and
tight
well
it
so
happened
that
red
was
a
hitter
howie
camnitz
was
pitching
for
pittsburgh
he
wound
up
and
in
came
the
ball
shoulder
high
murray
took
a
terrific
cut
at
it
and
the
ball
went
over
the
fence
it
was
a
home
run
and
the
game
was
over
back
in
the
clubhouse
murray
was
as
happy
as
a
lark
he
was
first
into
the
showers
and
out
boomed
his
wonderful
irish
tenor
singing
wild
irish
when
he
came
out
of
the
shower
still
singing
mcgraw
walked
over
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
all
of
us
were
watching
out
of
the
corner
of
our
eyes
because
we
knew
the
little
round
man
what
we
used
to
call
mcgraw
would
let
this
one
go
by
without
saying
mcgraw
said
did
i
tell
you
to
do
told
me
to
bunt
murray
said
not
looking
quite
so
happy
anymore
you
know
what
happened
mac
camnitz
put
one
right
in
my
gut
so
i
it
did
you
say
he
put
it
asked
mcgraw
in
my
gut
murray
says
again
said
mcgraw
i
fining
you
a
hundred
dollars
and
you
can
try
putting
that
right
in
your
gut
too
and
off
he
went
oh
god
i
never
laughed
so
much
in
my
life
murray
never
did
live
that
down
years
later
something
would
happen
and
we
yell
to
murray
red
is
that
right
in
your
gut
there
were
a
lot
of
grand
guys
on
that
club
christy
mathewson
and
chief
meyers
larry
doyle
and
fred
snodgrass
al
bridwell
and
bugs
raymond
bugs
raymond
ah
yes
what
a
terrific
spitball
pitcher
he
was
bugs
drank
a
lot
you
know
and
sometimes
it
seemed
like
the
more
he
drank
the
better
he
pitched
they
used
to
say
that
he
did
spit
on
the
ball
he
blew
his
breath
on
it
and
the
ball
would
come
up
drunk
actually
there
was
very
little
drinking
in
baseball
in
those
days
it
a
shame
that
drinking
will
become
more
and
more
commonplace
in
american
sports
with
the
passage
of
time
i
have
seen
it
and
it
is
sad
myself
i
never
smoked
or
took
a
drink
in
my
life
i
always
said
you
ca
burn
the
candle
at
both
ends
you
want
to
be
a
ballplayer
be
a
ballplayer
if
you
want
to
go
out
and
carouse
and
chase
around
do
that
but
you
ca
do
them
both
at
once
of
course
continued
rube
marquard
shadow
we
were
on
the
road
we
had
a
nightly
eleven
bed
check
at
eleven
we
all
had
to
be
in
our
rooms
and
the
trainer
would
come
around
and
check
us
off
we
usually
have
a
whole
floor
in
a
hotel
and
we
be
two
to
a
room
i
always
roomed
with
matty
all
the
while
i
was
on
the
giants
what
a
grand
guy
he
was
the
door
would
be
wide
open
at
eleven
and
the
trainer
would
come
by
with
a
board
with
all
the
names
on
it
poke
his
head
in
mathewson
marquard
check
and
lock
the
door
next
room
check
lock
the
door
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
never
drank
a
drop
even
when
i
was
in
show
business
in
i
made
a
movie
with
alice
joyce
and
maurice
costello
and
then
i
was
in
vaudeville
for
three
years
blossom
seeley
and
i
that
when
she
was
my
wife
it
did
work
out
though
i
asked
her
to
quit
the
stage
i
told
her
i
could
give
her
everything
she
wanted
she
told
me
business
is
show
business
i
said
is
mine
so
we
parted
you
mentioned
that
you
were
with
the
giants
for
seven
years
and
then
the
dodgers
for
five
did
you
not
how
did
it
feel
when
you
were
traded
from
the
giants
to
the
dodgers
asked
elephant
well
said
the
shadow
not
too
bad
see
i
traded
myself
i
seem
to
be
able
to
get
going
in
after
i
pitched
that
early
in
april
and
late
in
the
season
mcgraw
started
riding
me
that
was
a
very
bad
year
for
the
giants
you
know
we
were
favored
to
win
the
pennant
and
instead
we
wound
up
last
so
mcgraw
was
very
happy
after
i
had
taken
about
as
much
riding
as
i
could
stand
i
asked
him
to
trade
me
if
he
thought
i
was
so
bad
would
take
you
he
said
to
me
do
you
mean
i
asked
can
still
lick
any
club
in
the
league
and
i
could
too
heck
i
was
even
years
old
then
any
club
in
the
league
scoffed
mcgraw
could
lick
a
postage
stamp
me
a
chance
to
trade
myself
then
i
suggested
would
you
sell
me
for
thousand
five
hundred
bills
he
answered
i
said
i
use
your
phone
he
said
we
were
both
pretty
mad
at
that
point
so
i
got
of
the
operator
and
asked
her
to
get
me
wilbert
robinson
manager
of
the
brooklyn
club
you
see
robbie
that
what
we
called
him
had
been
a
coach
with
us
for
years
before
he
became
the
dodger
manager
in
after
a
while
she
got
robbie
on
the
phone
he
says
are
you
robbie
i
asked
fine
he
said
is
this
now
i
had
to
handle
this
conversation
very
carefully
my
whole
world
depended
on
it
would
you
like
to
have
a
good
pitcher
i
said
in
a
jovial
tone
i
love
it
he
said
is
this
who
the
man
who
are
you
going
to
recommend
i
then
dropped
the
clincher
going
to
recommend
myself
i
told
him
are
you
he
repeated
marquard
i
said
trying
to
sound
impressive
robbie
said
are
you
kidding
around
for
rube
i
have
to
go
out
on
the
field
and
i
do
have
time
to
fool
around
i
told
him
serious
mcgraw
is
right
here
and
he
says
sell
me
for
seven
thousand
five
hundred
buckaroos
do
you
want
to
talk
to
him
course
i
do
robbie
said
and
right
then
and
there
i
was
traded
from
the
giants
to
the
dodgers
and
of
course
we
the
dodgers
that
is
won
the
pennant
the
next
year
and
i
had
one
of
the
best
years
i
ever
had
i
think
i
had
an
earned
run
average
of
about
one
and
a
half
in
and
then
we
won
the
pennant
again
in
so
everything
worked
out
pretty
well
one
day
when
i
was
pitching
for
brooklyn
i
pitched
the
first
game
of
a
against
boston
and
beat
them
one
to
zip
i
was
in
the
clubhouse
during
the
second
game
taking
off
my
uniform
when
the
clubhouse
boy
came
in
he
said
to
me
an
elderly
gentleman
outside
who
wants
to
see
you
he
says
he
your
father
from
cleveland
is
not
my
father
i
said
father
would
go
across
the
street
to
see
me
but
you
go
out
and
get
his
autograph
book
and
bring
it
in
and
i
autograph
it
for
him
but
instead
of
bringing
in
the
book
he
brought
in
my
dad
and
we
were
both
delighted
to
see
one
another
said
my
father
to
me
sure
are
a
hardhead
you
know
i
did
mean
what
i
said
ten
years
ago
about
you
dad
i
said
as
stubborn
as
i
am
i
thought
you
never
wanted
to
see
me
again
i
thought
you
meant
it
course
i
did
he
said
after
we
talked
a
while
i
said
you
see
the
game
today
he
said
did
were
you
sitting
i
asked
him
you
know
the
man
who
wears
that
funny
thing
on
his
face
mean
the
mask
the
catcher
i
said
guess
so
my
father
said
with
a
smile
anyway
i
was
halfway
between
him
and
the
number
one
you
know
where
they
run
right
after
they
hit
the
ball
mean
first
base
i
asked
do
know
he
said
do
know
what
they
call
it
i
was
sitting
in
the
middle
there
many
ball
games
have
you
seen
since
i
became
a
ballplayer
dad
i
wanted
to
know
is
the
first
one
he
said
well
he
stayed
in
new
york
with
me
for
a
few
weeks
and
we
had
a
great
time
finally
he
had
to
go
back
to
cleveland
after
he
left
the
newspapers
heard
about
my
dad
and
they
wanted
to
know
his
address
back
home
so
i
gave
it
to
them
and
doggone
if
they
did
send
reporters
and
photographers
to
cleveland
to
interview
him
they
took
his
picture
and
asked
him
a
lot
of
questions
one
of
the
things
they
asked
him
was
whether
he
had
ever
played
very
much
baseball
himself
he
told
them
course
i
did
when
i
was
younger
i
used
to
love
to
play
baseball
i
used
to
be
a
pitcher
just
like
my
son
richard
i
mean
like
my
son
rube
you
proud
of
your
son
they
asked
him
certainly
am
dad
said
should
i
be
he
a
great
baseball
player
is
he
the
group
of
ozites
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
as
the
forest
monster
carried
them
along
toward
yoraitia
the
large
pachyderm
could
feel
a
tear
welling
up
in
his
left
eye
and
he
brushed
it
away
with
his
trunk
chapter
the
restoration
of
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
the
little
party
arrived
in
yoraitia
in
a
short
time
when
they
got
there
it
looked
like
as
happy
a
township
as
any
other
in
the
marvelous
land
of
oz
i
knew
there
could
not
be
any
really
serious
drought
in
our
fairyland
said
elephant
happily
after
all
oz
is
always
pleasant
and
lovely
lurliné
enchantment
has
always
seen
to
that
i
thought
that
lurliné
was
only
a
character
from
an
ancient
legend
scowled
the
forest
monster
in
any
event
i
was
not
created
by
any
fairy
enchantment
i
know
for
i
was
created
by
two
prominent
wicked
witches
and
i
was
hatched
out
of
an
egg
just
like
any
other
replied
lisa
but
that
does
prove
anything
in
any
event
glinda
the
good
said
there
was
a
drought
happening
here
but
clearly
she
was
mistaken
i
do
think
droughts
are
natural
in
any
part
of
oz
anyway
they
are
agreed
ozma
but
glinda
would
not
have
told
me
a
lie
she
must
have
believed
there
was
one
here
i
think
maybe
she
was
right
said
tweaty
look
here
i
see
that
this
tree
was
only
watered
recently
see
it
looks
like
it
has
been
leaning
over
since
well
since
at
least
last
tuesday
at
around
three
before
that
i
fear
it
was
left
dry
for
several
weeks
tweaty
right
agreed
nibbles
i
can
see
it
starting
to
straighten
up
even
as
i
look
at
it
then
how
began
elephant
did
it
oh
i
think
i
know
of
course
added
lisa
glinda
has
already
been
here
she
has
already
determined
the
source
of
the
problem
and
fixed
it
as
she
spoke
she
noticed
out
of
the
corner
of
her
left
eye
that
another
personage
had
joined
the
group
glinda
said
ozma
instantly
recognizing
the
newcomer
your
majesty
replied
glinda
with
a
loving
smile
i
see
that
you
have
come
to
see
that
the
yoraitians
have
been
provided
for
it
was
really
very
simple
you
see
a
tribe
of
giant
beavers
had
just
claimed
a
territory
a
few
miles
up
the
river
it
is
natural
for
beavers
to
build
dams
and
they
had
no
awareness
that
theirs
was
blocking
off
the
water
supply
of
any
inhabited
towns
once
they
found
out
they
were
happy
to
remedy
the
situation
now
they
are
happily
helping
yoraitia
to
better
utilize
its
water
supply
they
are
really
very
intelligent
animals
and
they
have
acknowledged
you
as
their
queen
too
i
am
very
pleased
said
the
youthful
ruler
but
that
is
not
why
we
are
here
put
in
lisa
quickly
the
queen
needs
her
anmars
it
is
the
only
way
that
she
can
save
the
residents
of
the
lunechien
forest
the
lunechien
forest
echoed
the
good
witch
why
my
goodness
what
is
wrong
with
the
lunechien
forest
the
last
i
read
of
it
in
my
great
book
of
records
it
was
a
very
happy
land
of
elephants
and
unicorns
and
other
carefree
creatures
indeed
it
was
said
the
forest
monster
gravely
but
i
afraid
its
hardships
are
all
my
fault
in
my
thirst
for
power
i
drained
many
of
the
small
unfortunate
beasts
of
all
their
strengths
and
abilities
i
have
since
seen
the
error
of
my
ways
and
i
repent
of
my
unozlike
actions
i
had
been
so
blinded
by
my
resentment
toward
the
cowardly
lion
that
i
was
not
even
thinking
about
how
much
wickedness
i
was
doing
the
little
of
oz
has
forgiven
me
already
i
am
willing
to
do
whatever
i
can
to
make
restitution
for
my
acts
i
know
that
you
are
also
a
queen
and
that
you
are
one
of
ozma
closest
advisors
if
you
wish
me
banished
from
all
oz
once
you
have
restored
all
of
my
poor
victims
i
will
accept
the
punishment
without
a
murmur
the
shadow
of
rube
marquard
stood
still
and
listened
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
ozma
looked
at
glinda
the
forest
monster
really
has
repented
she
said
i
saw
the
change
with
my
own
two
eyes
he
is
willing
to
be
restored
to
the
size
of
a
natural
spider
so
that
all
the
others
can
have
what
he
took
from
them
then
it
shall
be
done
agreed
glinda
handing
ozma
the
magical
tool
the
forest
monster
carried
the
entire
group
including
glinda
to
the
famous
ozian
forest
instantly
he
and
ozma
gathered
up
the
comatose
lunechien
animals
and
prepared
to
restore
them
to
rights
glinda
also
lent
a
hand
in
the
restoration
process
it
was
not
an
easy
task
but
in
only
a
little
more
than
fourteen
hours
the
lush
lunechien
forest
was
once
again
alive
with
the
sounds
of
joyful
birds
and
animals
milling
about
among
the
trees
and
bushes
at
the
end
of
it
all
the
forest
monster
was
as
small
as
a
typical
arachnid
still
his
tiny
face
was
all
smiles
indeed
he
was
as
happy
as
a
lark
that
the
poor
animals
he
had
wronged
could
be
righted
again
and
in
fact
it
has
been
recorded
in
glinda
great
book
of
records
that
not
a
single
animal
was
overlooked
during
the
restoration
process
all
were
brought
back
to
their
former
selves
without
exception
well
maybe
one
exception
somehow
in
all
of
the
hubbub
tweaty
was
overlooked
he
did
not
consider
it
politic
to
interrupt
the
proceedings
after
all
his
fellow
beasts
had
had
a
far
worse
enchantment
than
he
had
of
course
it
was
uncomfortable
to
be
a
tiny
orange
elephant
but
how
much
worse
to
be
completely
without
oneself
he
decided
to
wait
until
another
time
to
ask
to
be
restored
he
felt
that
it
would
be
too
much
of
a
selfish
act
to
ask
ozma
or
glinda
to
take
time
away
from
those
who
truly
needed
their
help
when
he
knew
that
he
could
stand
to
be
a
small
orange
elephant
for
a
little
while
longer
the
reunion
of
the
lunechien
friends
and
families
was
a
cause
for
celebration
throughout
the
forest
a
grand
party
was
enjoyed
by
all
and
even
the
cowardly
lion
made
another
trip
away
from
home
to
pay
his
respects
upon
his
fellow
foresters
the
celebration
went
on
the
wee
hours
of
the
morning
when
ozma
and
glinda
had
to
get
back
to
their
regular
duties
as
for
the
residents
of
the
lunechien
forest
i
am
told
that
they
are
as
happy
today
as
ever
they
were
the
former
forest
monster
now
content
to
stay
small
and
keep
a
low
profile
continues
to
this
day
to
spin
the
most
delicate
and
beautiful
webs
you
can
imagine
and
indeed
he
did
have
one
of
his
creations
covered
in
gold
and
gave
it
to
ozma
as
a
sign
of
his
submission
to
her
rule
she
keeps
it
hanging
over
her
bed
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
the
last
thing
she
looks
upon
at
night
the
has
told
me
that
it
functions
as
a
dreamcatcher
preventing
any
unhappy
dreams
from
ever
reaching
her
as
she
slumbers
the
sleep
fays
who
once
kept
out
these
bad
dreams
have
voiced
their
gratitude
to
the
former
forest
monster
for
this
fine
gift
and
now
it
is
time
to
say
goodbye
for
a
time
to
our
happy
friends
in
oz
but
do
not
fret
queen
ozma
is
always
sending
us
new
messages
from
her
glorious
domain
i
can
assure
you
that
it
will
not
be
so
very
long
at
all
before
we
will
all
be
getting
together
again
over
another
oz
book
until
then
both
of
your
grateful
historians
wish
you
as
much
happiness
as
is
again
known
in
the
lunechien
forest
of
oz
