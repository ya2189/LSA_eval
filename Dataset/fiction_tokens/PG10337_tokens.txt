wonderful
or
supernatural
events
are
not
so
uncommon
rather
they
are
irregular
in
their
incidence
thus
there
may
be
not
one
marvel
to
speak
of
in
a
century
and
then
often
enough
comes
a
plentiful
crop
of
them
monsters
of
all
sorts
swarm
suddenly
upon
the
earth
comets
blaze
in
the
sky
eclipses
frighten
nature
meteors
fall
in
rain
while
mermaids
and
sirens
beguile
and
engulf
every
passing
ship
and
terrible
cataclysms
beset
humanity
but
the
strange
event
which
i
shall
here
relate
came
alone
unsupported
without
companions
into
a
hostile
world
and
for
that
very
reason
claimed
little
of
the
general
attention
of
mankind
for
the
sudden
changing
of
tebrick
into
a
vixen
is
an
established
fact
which
we
may
attempt
to
account
for
as
we
will
certainly
it
is
in
the
explanation
of
the
fact
and
the
reconciling
of
it
with
our
general
notions
that
we
shall
find
most
difficulty
and
not
in
accepting
for
true
a
story
which
is
so
fully
proved
and
that
not
by
one
witness
but
by
a
dozen
all
respectable
and
with
no
possibility
of
collusion
between
them
but
here
i
will
confine
myself
to
an
exact
narrative
of
the
event
and
all
that
followed
on
it
yet
i
would
not
dissuade
any
of
my
readers
from
attempting
an
explanation
of
this
seeming
miracle
because
up
till
now
none
has
been
found
which
is
entirely
satisfactory
what
adds
to
the
difficulty
to
my
mind
is
that
the
metamorphosis
occurred
when
tebrick
was
a
woman
and
that
it
happened
suddenly
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
the
sprouting
of
a
tail
the
gradual
extension
of
hair
all
over
the
body
the
slow
change
of
the
whole
anatomy
by
a
process
of
growth
though
it
would
have
been
monstrous
would
not
have
been
so
difficult
to
reconcile
to
our
ordinary
conceptions
particularly
had
it
happened
in
a
young
child
but
here
we
have
something
very
different
a
grown
lady
is
changed
straightway
into
a
fox
there
is
no
explaining
that
away
by
any
natural
philosophy
the
materialism
of
our
age
will
not
help
us
here
it
is
indeed
a
something
from
outside
our
world
altogether
an
event
which
we
would
willingly
accept
if
we
were
to
meet
it
invested
with
the
authority
of
divine
revelation
in
the
scriptures
but
which
we
are
not
prepared
to
encounter
almost
in
our
time
happening
in
oxfordshire
amongst
our
neighbours
the
only
things
which
go
any
way
towards
an
explanation
of
it
are
but
guesswork
and
i
give
them
more
because
i
would
not
conceal
anything
than
because
i
think
they
are
of
any
worth
tebrick
maiden
name
was
certainly
fox
and
it
is
possible
that
such
a
miracle
happening
before
the
family
may
have
gained
their
name
as
a
on
that
account
they
were
an
ancient
family
and
have
had
their
seat
at
tangley
hall
time
out
of
mind
it
is
also
true
that
there
was
a
fox
once
upon
a
time
chained
up
at
tangley
hall
in
the
inner
yard
and
i
have
heard
many
speculative
wiseacres
in
the
turn
that
to
great
account
though
they
could
not
but
admit
that
there
was
never
one
there
in
miss
silvia
time
at
first
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
silvia
fox
having
once
hunted
when
she
was
a
child
of
ten
and
having
been
blooded
might
furnish
more
of
an
explanation
it
seems
she
took
great
fright
or
disgust
at
it
and
vomited
after
it
was
done
but
now
i
do
not
see
that
it
has
much
bearing
on
the
miracle
itself
even
though
we
know
that
after
that
she
always
spoke
of
the
poor
foxes
when
a
hunt
was
stirring
and
never
rode
to
hounds
till
after
her
marriage
when
her
husband
persuaded
her
to
it
she
was
married
in
the
year
to
richard
tebrick
after
a
short
courtship
and
went
to
live
after
their
honeymoon
at
rylands
near
stokoe
oxon
one
point
indeed
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
and
that
is
how
they
first
became
acquainted
tangley
hall
is
over
thirty
miles
from
stokoe
and
is
extremely
remote
indeed
to
this
day
there
is
no
proper
road
to
it
which
is
all
the
more
remarkable
as
it
is
the
principal
and
indeed
the
only
manor
house
for
several
miles
round
whether
it
was
from
a
chance
meeting
on
the
roads
or
less
romantic
but
more
probable
by
tebrick
becoming
acquainted
with
her
uncle
a
minor
canon
at
oxford
and
thence
being
invited
by
him
to
visit
tangley
hall
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
however
they
became
acquainted
the
marriage
was
a
very
happy
one
the
bride
was
in
her
year
she
was
small
with
remarkably
small
hands
and
feet
it
is
perhaps
worth
noting
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
foxy
or
vixenish
in
her
appearance
on
the
contrary
she
was
a
more
than
ordinarily
beautiful
and
agreeable
woman
her
eyes
were
of
a
clear
hazel
but
exceptionally
brilliant
her
hair
dark
with
a
shade
of
red
in
it
her
skin
brownish
with
a
few
dark
freckles
and
little
moles
in
manner
she
was
reserved
almost
to
shyness
but
perfectly
and
perfectly
she
had
been
strictly
brought
up
by
a
woman
of
excellent
principles
and
considerable
attainments
who
died
a
year
or
so
before
the
marriage
and
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
her
mother
had
been
dead
many
years
and
her
father
bedridden
and
not
altogether
rational
for
a
little
while
before
his
death
they
had
few
visitors
but
her
uncle
he
often
stopped
with
them
a
month
or
two
at
a
stretch
particularly
in
winter
as
he
was
fond
of
shooting
snipe
which
are
plentiful
in
the
valley
there
that
she
did
not
grow
up
a
country
hoyden
is
to
be
explained
by
the
strictness
of
her
governess
and
the
influence
of
her
uncle
but
perhaps
living
in
so
wild
a
place
gave
her
some
disposition
to
wildness
even
in
spite
of
her
religious
upbringing
her
old
nurse
said
miss
silvia
was
always
a
little
wild
at
heart
though
if
this
was
true
it
was
never
seen
by
anyone
else
except
her
husband
on
one
of
the
first
days
of
the
year
in
the
early
afternoon
husband
and
wife
went
for
a
walk
in
the
copse
on
the
little
hill
above
rylands
they
were
still
at
this
time
like
lovers
in
their
behaviour
and
were
always
together
while
they
were
walking
they
heard
the
hounds
and
later
the
huntsman
horn
in
the
distance
tebrick
had
persuaded
her
to
hunt
on
boxing
day
but
with
great
difficulty
and
she
had
not
enjoyed
it
though
of
hacking
she
was
fond
enough
hearing
the
hunt
tebrick
quickened
his
pace
so
as
to
reach
the
edge
of
the
copse
where
they
might
get
a
good
view
of
the
hounds
if
they
came
that
way
his
wife
hung
back
and
he
holding
her
hand
began
almost
to
drag
her
before
they
gained
the
edge
of
the
copse
she
suddenly
snatched
her
hand
away
from
his
very
violently
and
cried
out
so
that
he
instantly
turned
his
head
his
wife
had
been
the
moment
before
was
a
small
fox
of
a
very
bright
it
looked
at
him
very
beseechingly
advanced
towards
him
a
pace
or
two
and
he
saw
at
once
that
his
wife
was
looking
at
him
from
the
animal
eyes
you
may
well
think
if
he
were
aghast
and
so
maybe
was
his
lady
at
finding
herself
in
that
shape
so
they
did
nothing
for
nearly
but
stare
at
each
other
he
bewildered
she
asking
him
with
her
eyes
as
if
indeed
she
spoke
to
him
what
am
i
now
become
have
pity
on
me
husband
have
pity
on
me
for
i
am
your
wife
so
that
with
his
gazing
on
her
and
knowing
her
well
even
in
such
a
shape
yet
asking
himself
at
every
moment
can
it
be
she
am
i
not
dreaming
and
her
beseeching
and
lastly
fawning
on
him
and
seeming
to
tell
him
that
it
was
she
indeed
they
came
at
last
together
and
he
took
her
in
his
arms
she
lay
very
close
to
him
nestling
under
his
coat
and
fell
to
licking
his
face
but
never
taking
her
eyes
from
his
the
husband
all
this
while
kept
turning
the
thing
in
his
head
and
gazing
on
her
but
he
could
make
no
sense
of
what
had
happened
but
only
comforted
himself
with
the
hope
that
this
was
but
a
momentary
change
and
that
presently
she
would
turn
back
again
into
the
wife
that
was
one
flesh
with
him
one
fancy
that
came
to
him
because
he
was
so
much
more
like
a
lover
than
a
husband
was
that
it
was
his
fault
and
this
because
if
anything
dreadful
happened
he
could
never
blame
her
but
himself
for
it
so
they
passed
a
good
while
till
at
last
the
tears
welled
up
in
the
poor
fox
eyes
and
she
began
weeping
but
quite
in
silence
and
she
trembled
too
as
if
she
were
in
a
fever
at
this
he
could
not
contain
his
own
tears
but
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
sobbed
for
a
great
while
but
between
his
sobs
kissing
her
quite
as
if
she
had
been
a
woman
and
not
caring
in
his
grief
that
he
was
kissing
a
fox
on
the
muzzle
they
sat
thus
till
it
was
getting
near
dusk
when
he
recollected
himself
and
the
next
thing
was
that
he
must
somehow
hide
her
and
then
bring
her
home
he
waited
till
it
was
quite
dark
that
he
might
the
better
bring
her
into
her
own
house
without
being
seen
and
buttoned
her
inside
his
topcoat
nay
even
in
his
passion
tearing
open
his
waistcoat
and
his
shirt
that
she
might
lie
the
closer
to
his
heart
for
when
we
are
overcome
with
the
greatest
sorrow
we
act
not
like
men
or
women
but
like
children
whose
comfort
in
all
their
troubles
is
to
press
themselves
against
their
mother
breast
or
if
she
be
not
there
to
hold
each
other
tight
in
one
another
arms
when
it
was
dark
he
brought
her
in
with
infinite
precautions
yet
not
without
the
dogs
scenting
her
after
which
nothing
could
moderate
their
clamour
having
got
her
into
the
house
the
next
thing
he
thought
of
was
to
hide
her
from
the
servants
he
carried
her
to
the
bedroom
in
his
arms
and
then
went
downstairs
again
tebrick
had
three
servants
living
in
the
house
the
cook
the
and
an
old
woman
who
had
been
his
wife
nurse
besides
these
women
there
was
a
groom
or
a
gardener
whichever
you
choose
to
call
him
who
was
a
single
man
and
so
lived
out
lodging
with
a
labouring
family
about
half
a
mile
away
tebrick
going
downstairs
pitched
upon
the
janet
says
he
tebrick
and
i
have
had
some
bad
news
and
tebrick
was
called
away
instantly
to
london
and
left
this
afternoon
and
i
am
staying
to
put
our
affairs
in
order
we
are
shutting
up
the
house
and
i
must
give
you
and
brant
a
month
wages
and
ask
you
to
leave
morning
at
seven
we
shall
probably
go
away
to
the
continent
and
i
do
not
know
when
we
shall
come
back
please
tell
the
others
and
now
get
me
my
tea
and
bring
it
into
my
study
on
a
tray
janet
said
nothing
for
she
was
a
shy
girl
particularly
before
gentlemen
but
when
she
entered
the
kitchen
tebrick
heard
a
sudden
burst
of
conversation
with
many
exclamations
from
the
cook
when
she
came
back
with
his
tea
tebrick
said
i
shall
not
require
you
upstairs
pack
your
own
things
and
tell
james
to
have
the
waggonette
ready
for
you
by
seven
morning
to
take
you
to
the
station
i
am
busy
now
but
i
will
see
you
again
before
you
go
when
she
had
gone
tebrick
took
the
tray
upstairs
for
the
first
moment
he
thought
the
room
was
empty
and
his
vixen
got
away
for
he
could
see
no
sign
of
her
anywhere
but
after
a
moment
he
saw
something
stirring
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
then
behold
she
came
forth
dragging
her
into
which
she
had
somehow
struggled
this
must
surely
have
been
a
comical
sight
but
poor
tebrick
was
altogether
too
distressed
then
or
at
any
time
afterwards
to
divert
himself
at
such
ludicrous
scenes
he
only
called
to
her
softly
silvia
silvia
what
do
you
do
there
and
then
in
a
moment
saw
for
himself
what
she
would
be
at
and
began
once
more
to
blame
himself
heartily
because
he
had
not
guessed
that
his
wife
would
not
like
to
go
naked
notwithstanding
the
shape
she
was
in
nothing
would
satisfy
him
then
till
he
had
clothed
her
suitably
bringing
her
dresses
from
the
wardrobe
for
her
to
choose
but
as
might
have
been
expected
they
were
too
big
for
her
now
but
at
last
he
picked
out
a
little
that
she
was
fond
of
wearing
sometimes
in
the
mornings
it
was
made
of
a
flowered
silk
trimmed
with
lace
and
the
sleeves
short
enough
to
sit
very
well
on
her
now
while
he
tied
the
ribands
his
poor
lady
thanked
him
with
gentle
looks
and
not
without
some
modesty
and
confusion
he
propped
her
up
in
an
armchair
with
some
cushions
and
they
took
tea
together
she
very
delicately
drinking
from
a
saucer
and
taking
bread
and
butter
from
his
hands
all
this
showed
him
or
so
he
thought
that
his
wife
was
still
herself
there
was
so
little
wildness
in
her
demeanour
and
so
much
delicacy
and
decency
especially
in
her
not
wishing
to
run
naked
that
he
was
very
much
comforted
and
began
to
fancy
they
could
be
happy
enough
if
they
could
escape
the
world
and
live
always
alone
from
this
too
sanguine
dream
he
was
aroused
by
hearing
the
gardener
speaking
to
the
dogs
trying
to
quiet
them
for
ever
since
he
had
come
in
with
his
vixen
they
had
been
whining
barking
and
growling
and
all
as
he
knew
because
there
was
a
fox
within
doors
and
they
would
kill
it
he
started
up
now
calling
to
the
gardener
that
he
would
come
down
to
the
dogs
himself
to
quiet
them
and
bade
the
man
go
indoors
again
and
leave
it
to
him
all
this
he
said
in
a
dry
compelling
kind
of
voice
which
made
the
fellow
do
as
he
was
bid
though
it
was
against
his
will
for
he
was
curious
tebrick
went
downstairs
and
taking
his
gun
from
the
rack
loaded
it
and
went
out
into
the
yard
now
there
were
two
dogs
one
a
handsome
irish
setter
that
was
his
wife
dog
she
had
brought
it
with
her
from
tangley
hall
on
her
marriage
the
other
was
an
old
fox
terrier
called
nelly
that
he
had
had
ten
years
or
more
when
he
came
out
into
the
yard
both
dogs
saluted
him
by
barking
and
whining
twice
as
much
as
they
did
before
the
setter
jumping
up
and
down
at
the
end
of
his
chain
in
a
frenzy
and
nelly
shivering
wagging
her
tail
and
looking
first
at
her
master
and
then
at
the
house
door
where
she
could
smell
the
fox
right
enough
there
was
a
bright
moon
so
that
tebrick
could
see
the
dogs
as
clearly
as
could
be
first
he
shot
his
wife
setter
dead
and
then
looked
about
him
for
nelly
to
give
her
the
other
barrel
but
he
could
see
her
nowhere
the
bitch
was
clean
gone
till
looking
to
see
how
she
had
broken
her
chain
he
found
her
lying
hid
in
the
back
of
her
kennel
but
that
trick
did
not
save
her
for
tebrick
after
trying
to
pull
her
out
by
her
chain
and
finding
it
useless
she
would
not
come
thrust
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
into
the
kennel
pressed
it
into
her
body
and
so
shot
her
afterwards
striking
a
match
he
looked
in
at
her
to
make
certain
she
was
dead
then
leaving
the
dogs
as
they
were
chained
up
tebrick
went
indoors
again
and
found
the
gardener
who
had
not
yet
gone
home
gave
him
a
month
wages
in
lieu
of
notice
and
told
him
he
had
a
job
for
him
yet
to
bury
the
two
dogs
and
that
he
should
do
it
that
same
night
but
by
all
this
going
on
with
so
much
strangeness
and
authority
on
his
part
as
it
seemed
to
them
the
servants
were
much
troubled
hearing
the
shots
while
he
was
out
in
the
yard
his
wife
old
nurse
or
nanny
ran
up
to
the
bedroom
though
she
had
no
business
there
and
so
opening
the
door
saw
the
poor
fox
dressed
in
my
lady
little
jacket
lying
back
in
the
cushions
and
in
such
a
reverie
of
woe
that
she
heard
nothing
old
nanny
though
she
was
not
expecting
to
find
her
mistress
there
having
been
told
that
she
was
gone
that
afternoon
to
london
knew
her
instantly
and
cried
out
oh
my
poor
precious
oh
poor
miss
silvia
what
dreadful
change
is
this
then
seeing
her
mistress
start
and
look
at
her
she
cried
out
but
never
fear
my
darling
it
will
all
come
right
your
old
nanny
knows
you
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
end
but
though
she
said
this
she
did
not
care
to
look
again
and
kept
her
eyes
turned
away
so
as
not
to
meet
the
foxy
slit
ones
of
her
mistress
for
that
was
too
much
for
her
so
she
hurried
out
soon
fearing
to
be
found
there
by
tebrick
and
who
knows
perhaps
shot
like
the
dogs
for
knowing
the
secret
tebrick
had
all
this
time
gone
about
paying
off
his
servants
and
shooting
his
dogs
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
now
he
fortified
himself
with
two
or
three
glasses
of
strong
whisky
and
went
to
bed
taking
his
vixen
into
his
arms
where
he
slept
soundly
whether
she
did
or
not
is
more
than
i
or
anybody
else
can
say
in
the
morning
when
he
woke
up
they
had
the
place
to
themselves
for
on
his
instructions
the
servants
had
all
left
first
thing
janet
and
the
cook
to
oxford
where
they
would
try
and
find
new
places
and
nanny
going
back
to
the
cottage
near
tangley
where
her
son
lived
who
was
the
pigman
there
so
with
that
morning
there
began
what
was
now
to
be
their
ordinary
life
together
he
would
get
up
when
it
was
broad
day
and
first
thing
light
the
fire
downstairs
and
cook
the
breakfast
then
brush
his
wife
sponge
her
with
a
damp
sponge
then
brush
her
again
in
all
this
using
scent
very
freely
to
hide
somewhat
her
rank
odour
when
she
was
dressed
he
carried
her
downstairs
and
they
had
their
breakfast
together
she
sitting
up
to
table
with
him
drinking
her
saucer
of
tea
and
taking
her
food
from
his
fingers
or
at
any
rate
being
fed
by
him
she
was
still
fond
of
the
same
food
that
she
had
been
used
to
before
her
transformation
a
lightly
boiled
egg
or
slice
of
ham
a
piece
of
buttered
toast
or
two
with
a
little
quince
and
apple
jam
while
i
am
on
the
subject
of
her
food
i
should
say
that
reading
in
the
encyclopedia
he
found
that
foxes
on
the
continent
are
inordinately
fond
of
grapes
and
that
during
the
autumn
season
they
abandon
their
ordinary
diet
for
them
and
then
grow
exceedingly
fat
and
lose
their
offensive
odour
this
appetite
for
grapes
is
so
well
confirmed
by
aesop
and
by
passages
in
the
scriptures
that
it
is
strange
tebrick
should
not
have
known
it
after
reading
this
account
he
wrote
to
london
for
a
basket
of
grapes
to
be
posted
to
him
twice
a
week
and
was
rejoiced
to
find
that
the
account
in
the
encyclopedia
was
true
in
the
most
important
of
these
particulars
his
vixen
relished
them
exceedingly
and
seemed
never
to
tire
of
them
so
that
he
increased
his
order
first
from
one
pound
to
three
pounds
and
afterwards
to
five
her
odour
abated
so
much
by
this
means
that
he
came
not
to
notice
it
at
all
except
sometimes
in
the
mornings
before
her
toilet
what
helped
most
to
make
living
with
her
bearable
for
him
was
that
she
understood
him
perfectly
yes
every
word
he
said
and
though
she
was
dumb
she
expressed
herself
very
fluently
by
looks
and
signs
though
never
by
the
voice
thus
he
frequently
conversed
with
her
telling
her
all
his
thoughts
and
hiding
nothing
from
her
and
this
the
more
readily
because
he
was
very
quick
to
catch
her
meaning
and
her
answers
puss
puss
he
would
say
to
her
for
calling
her
that
had
been
a
habit
with
him
always
sweet
puss
some
men
would
pity
me
living
alone
here
with
you
after
what
has
happened
but
i
would
not
change
places
while
you
were
living
with
any
man
for
the
whole
world
though
you
are
a
fox
i
would
rather
live
with
you
than
any
woman
i
swear
i
would
and
that
too
if
you
were
changed
to
anything
but
then
catching
her
grave
look
he
would
say
do
you
think
i
jest
on
these
things
my
dear
i
do
not
i
swear
to
you
my
darling
that
all
my
life
i
will
be
true
to
you
will
be
faithful
will
respect
and
reverence
you
who
are
my
wife
and
i
will
do
that
not
because
of
any
hope
that
god
in
his
mercy
will
see
fit
to
restore
your
shape
but
solely
because
i
love
you
however
you
may
be
changed
my
love
is
not
then
anyone
seeing
them
would
have
sworn
that
they
were
lovers
so
passionately
did
each
look
on
the
other
often
he
would
swear
to
her
that
the
devil
might
have
power
to
work
some
miracles
but
that
he
would
find
it
beyond
him
to
change
his
love
for
her
these
passionate
speeches
however
they
might
have
struck
his
wife
in
an
ordinary
way
now
seemed
to
be
her
chief
comfort
she
would
come
to
him
put
her
paw
in
his
hand
and
look
at
him
with
sparkling
eyes
shining
with
joy
and
gratitude
would
pant
with
eagerness
jump
at
him
and
lick
his
face
now
he
had
many
little
things
which
busied
him
in
the
house
getting
his
meals
setting
the
room
straight
making
the
bed
and
so
forth
when
he
was
doing
this
housework
it
was
comical
to
watch
his
vixen
often
she
was
as
it
were
beside
herself
with
vexation
and
distress
to
see
him
in
his
clumsy
way
doing
what
she
could
have
done
so
much
better
had
she
been
able
then
forgetful
of
the
decency
and
the
decorum
which
she
had
at
first
imposed
upon
herself
never
to
run
upon
all
fours
she
followed
him
everywhere
and
if
he
did
one
thing
wrong
she
stopped
him
and
showed
him
the
way
of
it
when
he
had
forgot
the
hour
for
his
meal
she
would
come
and
tug
his
sleeve
and
tell
him
as
if
she
spoke
husband
are
we
to
have
no
luncheon
this
womanliness
in
her
never
failed
to
delight
him
for
it
showed
she
was
still
his
wife
buried
as
it
were
in
the
carcase
of
a
beast
but
with
a
woman
soul
this
encouraged
him
so
much
that
he
debated
with
himself
whether
he
should
not
read
aloud
to
her
as
he
often
had
done
formerly
at
last
since
he
could
find
no
reason
against
it
he
went
to
the
shelf
and
fetched
down
a
volume
of
the
history
of
clarissa
harlowe
which
he
had
begun
to
read
aloud
to
her
a
few
weeks
before
he
opened
the
volume
where
he
had
left
off
with
lovelace
letter
after
he
had
spent
the
night
waiting
fruitlessly
in
the
copse
good
god
what
is
now
to
become
of
me
my
feet
benumbed
by
midnight
wanderings
through
the
heaviest
dews
that
ever
fell
my
wig
and
my
linen
dripping
with
the
hoarfrost
dissolving
on
them
day
but
just
breaking
etc
while
he
read
he
was
conscious
of
holding
her
attention
then
after
a
few
pages
the
story
claimed
all
his
so
that
he
read
on
for
about
without
looking
at
her
when
he
did
so
he
saw
that
she
was
not
listening
to
him
but
was
watching
something
with
strange
eagerness
such
a
fixed
intent
look
was
on
her
face
that
he
was
alarmed
and
sought
the
cause
of
it
presently
he
found
that
her
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
movements
of
her
pet
dove
which
was
in
its
cage
hanging
in
the
window
he
spoke
to
her
but
she
seemed
displeased
so
he
laid
clarissa
harlowe
aside
nor
did
he
ever
repeat
the
experiment
of
reading
to
her
yet
that
same
evening
as
he
happened
to
be
looking
through
his
writing
table
drawer
with
puss
beside
him
looking
over
his
elbow
she
spied
a
pack
of
cards
and
then
he
was
forced
to
pick
them
out
to
please
her
then
draw
them
from
their
case
at
last
trying
first
one
thing
then
another
he
found
that
what
she
was
after
was
to
play
piquet
with
him
they
had
some
difficulty
at
first
in
contriving
for
her
to
hold
her
cards
and
then
to
play
them
but
this
was
at
last
overcome
by
his
stacking
them
for
her
on
a
sloping
board
after
which
she
could
flip
them
out
very
neatly
with
her
claws
as
she
wanted
to
play
them
when
they
had
overcome
this
trouble
they
played
three
games
and
most
heartily
she
seemed
to
enjoy
them
moreover
she
won
all
three
of
them
after
this
they
often
played
a
quiet
game
of
piquet
together
and
cribbage
too
i
should
say
that
in
marking
the
points
at
cribbage
on
the
board
he
always
moved
her
pegs
for
her
as
well
as
his
own
for
she
could
not
handle
them
or
set
them
in
the
holes
the
weather
which
had
been
damp
and
misty
with
frequent
downpours
of
rain
improved
very
much
in
the
following
week
and
as
often
happens
in
january
there
were
several
days
with
the
sun
shining
no
wind
and
light
frosts
at
night
these
frosts
becoming
more
intense
as
the
days
went
on
till
bye
and
bye
they
began
to
think
of
snow
with
this
spell
of
fine
weather
it
was
but
natural
that
tebrick
should
think
of
taking
his
vixen
out
of
doors
this
was
something
he
had
not
yet
done
both
because
of
the
damp
rainy
weather
up
till
then
and
because
the
mere
notion
of
taking
her
out
filled
him
with
alarm
indeed
he
had
so
many
apprehensions
beforehand
that
at
one
time
he
resolved
totally
against
it
for
his
mind
was
filled
not
only
with
the
fear
that
she
might
escape
from
him
and
run
away
which
he
knew
was
groundless
but
with
more
rational
visions
such
as
wandering
curs
traps
gins
spring
guns
besides
a
dread
of
being
seen
with
her
by
the
neighbourhood
at
last
however
he
resolved
on
it
and
all
the
more
as
his
vixen
kept
asking
him
in
the
gentlest
way
might
she
not
go
out
into
the
garden
yet
she
always
listened
very
submissively
when
he
told
her
that
he
was
afraid
if
they
were
seen
together
it
would
excite
the
curiosity
of
their
neighbours
besides
this
he
often
told
her
of
his
fears
for
her
on
account
of
dogs
but
one
day
she
answered
this
by
leading
him
into
the
hall
and
pointing
boldly
to
his
gun
after
this
he
resolved
to
take
her
though
with
full
precautions
that
is
he
left
the
house
door
open
so
that
in
case
of
need
she
could
beat
a
swift
retreat
then
he
took
his
gun
under
his
arm
and
lastly
he
had
her
well
wrapped
up
in
a
little
fur
jacket
lest
she
should
take
cold
he
would
have
carried
her
too
but
that
she
delicately
disengaged
herself
from
his
arms
and
looked
at
him
very
expressively
to
say
that
she
would
go
by
herself
for
already
her
first
horror
of
being
seen
to
go
upon
all
fours
was
worn
off
reasoning
no
doubt
upon
it
that
either
she
must
resign
herself
to
go
that
way
or
else
stay
all
the
rest
of
her
life
her
joy
at
going
into
the
garden
was
inexpressible
first
she
ran
this
way
then
that
though
keeping
always
close
to
him
looking
very
sharply
with
ears
cocked
forward
first
at
one
thing
then
another
and
then
up
to
catch
his
eye
for
some
time
indeed
she
was
almost
dancing
with
delight
running
round
him
then
forward
a
yard
or
two
then
back
to
him
and
gambolling
beside
him
as
they
went
round
the
garden
but
in
spite
of
her
joy
she
was
full
of
fear
at
every
noise
a
cow
lowing
a
cock
crowing
or
a
ploughman
in
the
distance
hulloaing
to
scare
the
rooks
she
started
her
ears
pricked
to
catch
the
sound
her
muzzle
wrinkled
up
and
her
nose
twitched
and
she
would
then
press
herself
against
his
legs
they
walked
round
the
garden
and
down
to
the
pond
where
there
were
ornamental
waterfowl
teal
widgeon
and
mandarin
ducks
and
seeing
these
again
gave
her
great
pleasure
they
had
always
been
her
favourites
and
now
she
was
so
overjoyed
to
see
them
that
she
behaved
with
very
little
of
her
usual
first
she
stared
at
them
then
bouncing
up
to
her
husband
knee
sought
to
kindle
an
equal
excitement
in
his
mind
whilst
she
rested
her
paws
on
his
knee
she
turned
her
head
again
and
again
towards
the
ducks
as
though
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
them
and
then
ran
down
before
him
to
the
water
edge
but
her
appearance
threw
the
ducks
into
the
utmost
degree
of
consternation
those
on
shore
or
near
the
bank
swam
or
flew
to
the
centre
of
the
pond
and
there
huddled
in
a
bunch
and
then
swimming
round
and
round
they
began
such
a
quacking
that
tebrick
was
nearly
deafened
as
i
have
before
said
nothing
in
the
ludicrous
way
that
arose
out
of
the
metamorphosis
of
his
wife
and
such
incidents
were
plentiful
ever
stood
a
chance
of
being
smiled
at
by
him
so
in
this
case
too
for
realising
that
the
silly
ducks
thought
his
wife
a
fox
indeed
and
were
alarmed
on
that
account
he
found
painful
that
spectacle
which
to
others
might
have
been
amusing
not
so
his
vixen
who
appeared
if
anything
more
pleased
than
ever
when
she
saw
in
what
a
commotion
she
had
set
them
and
began
cutting
a
thousand
pretty
capers
though
at
first
he
called
to
her
to
come
back
and
walk
another
way
tebrick
was
overborne
by
her
pleasure
and
sat
down
while
she
frisked
around
him
happier
far
than
he
had
seen
her
ever
since
the
change
first
she
ran
up
to
him
in
a
laughing
way
all
smiles
and
then
ran
down
again
to
the
water
edge
and
began
frisking
and
frolicking
chasing
her
own
brush
dancing
on
her
hind
legs
even
and
rolling
on
the
ground
then
fell
to
running
in
circles
but
all
this
without
paying
any
heed
to
the
ducks
but
they
with
their
necks
craned
out
all
pointing
one
way
swam
to
and
fro
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
never
stopping
their
quack
quack
quack
and
keeping
time
too
for
they
all
quacked
in
chorus
presently
she
came
further
away
from
the
pond
and
he
thinking
they
had
had
enough
of
this
sort
of
entertainment
laid
hold
of
her
and
said
to
her
come
silvia
my
dear
it
is
growing
cold
and
it
is
time
we
went
indoors
i
am
sure
taking
the
air
has
done
you
a
world
of
good
but
we
must
not
linger
any
more
she
appeared
then
to
agree
with
him
though
she
threw
half
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
the
ducks
and
they
both
walked
soberly
enough
towards
the
house
when
they
had
gone
about
halfway
she
suddenly
slipped
round
and
was
off
he
turned
quickly
and
saw
the
ducks
had
been
following
them
so
she
drove
them
before
her
back
into
the
pond
the
ducks
running
in
terror
from
her
with
their
wings
spread
and
she
not
pressing
them
for
he
saw
that
had
she
been
so
minded
she
could
have
caught
two
or
three
of
the
nearest
then
with
her
brush
waving
above
her
she
came
gambolling
back
to
him
so
playfully
that
he
stroked
her
indulgently
though
he
was
first
vexed
and
then
rather
puzzled
that
his
wife
should
amuse
herself
with
such
pranks
but
when
they
got
within
doors
he
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
kissed
her
and
spoke
to
her
silvia
what
a
childish
creature
you
are
your
courage
under
misfortune
shall
be
a
lesson
to
me
but
i
can
not
i
can
not
bear
to
see
it
here
the
tears
stood
suddenly
in
his
eyes
and
he
lay
down
upon
the
ottoman
and
wept
paying
no
heed
to
her
until
presently
he
was
aroused
by
her
licking
his
cheek
and
his
ear
after
tea
she
led
him
to
the
drawing
room
and
scratched
at
the
door
till
he
opened
it
for
this
was
part
of
the
house
which
he
had
shut
up
thinking
three
or
four
rooms
enough
for
them
now
and
to
save
the
dusting
of
it
then
it
seemed
she
would
have
him
play
to
her
on
the
pianoforte
she
led
him
to
it
nay
what
is
more
she
would
herself
pick
out
the
music
he
was
to
play
first
it
was
a
fugue
of
handel
then
one
of
mendelssohn
songs
without
words
and
then
the
diver
and
then
music
from
gilbert
and
sullivan
but
each
piece
of
music
she
picked
out
was
gayer
than
the
last
one
thus
they
sat
happily
engrossed
for
perhaps
an
hour
in
the
candle
light
until
the
extreme
cold
in
that
unwarmed
room
stopped
his
playing
and
drove
them
downstairs
to
the
fire
thus
did
she
admirably
comfort
her
husband
when
he
was
dispirited
yet
next
morning
when
he
woke
he
was
distressed
when
he
found
that
she
was
not
in
the
bed
with
him
but
was
lying
curled
up
at
the
foot
of
it
during
breakfast
she
hardly
listened
when
he
spoke
and
then
impatiently
but
sat
staring
at
the
dove
tebrick
sat
silently
looking
out
of
window
for
some
time
then
he
took
out
his
pocket
book
in
it
there
was
a
photograph
of
his
wife
taken
soon
after
their
wedding
now
he
gazed
and
gazed
upon
those
familiar
features
and
now
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
the
animal
before
him
he
laughed
then
bitterly
the
first
and
last
time
for
that
matter
that
tebrick
ever
laughed
at
his
wife
transformation
for
he
was
not
very
humorous
but
this
laugh
was
sour
and
painful
to
him
then
he
tore
up
the
photograph
into
little
pieces
and
scattered
them
out
of
the
window
saying
to
himself
memories
will
not
help
me
here
and
turning
to
the
vixen
he
saw
that
she
was
still
staring
at
the
caged
bird
and
as
he
looked
he
saw
her
lick
her
chops
he
took
the
bird
into
the
next
room
then
acting
suddenly
upon
the
impulse
he
opened
the
cage
door
and
set
it
free
saying
as
he
did
so
go
poor
bird
fly
from
this
wretched
house
while
you
still
remember
your
mistress
who
fed
you
from
her
coral
lips
you
are
not
a
fit
plaything
for
her
now
farewell
poor
bird
farewell
unless
he
added
with
a
melancholy
smile
you
return
with
good
tidings
like
dove
but
poor
gentleman
his
troubles
were
not
over
yet
and
indeed
one
may
say
that
he
ran
to
meet
them
by
his
constant
supposing
that
his
lady
should
still
be
the
same
to
a
tittle
in
her
behaviour
now
that
she
was
changed
into
a
fox
without
making
any
unwarrantable
suppositions
as
to
her
soul
or
what
had
now
become
of
it
though
we
could
find
a
good
deal
to
the
purpose
on
that
point
in
the
system
of
paracelsus
let
us
consider
only
how
much
the
change
in
her
body
must
needs
affect
her
ordinary
conduct
so
that
before
we
judge
too
harshly
of
this
unfortunate
lady
we
must
reflect
upon
the
physical
necessities
and
infirmities
and
appetites
of
her
new
condition
and
we
must
magnify
the
fortitude
of
her
mind
which
enabled
her
to
behave
with
decorum
cleanliness
and
decency
in
spite
of
her
new
situation
thus
she
might
have
been
expected
to
befoul
her
room
yet
never
could
anyone
whether
man
or
beast
have
shown
more
nicety
in
such
matters
but
at
luncheon
tebrick
helped
her
to
a
wing
of
chicken
and
leaving
the
room
for
a
minute
to
fetch
some
water
which
he
had
forgot
found
her
at
his
return
on
the
table
crunching
the
very
bones
he
stood
silent
dismayed
and
wounded
to
the
heart
at
this
sight
for
we
must
observe
that
this
unfortunate
husband
thought
always
of
his
vixen
as
that
gentle
and
delicate
woman
she
had
lately
been
so
that
whenever
his
conduct
went
beyond
that
which
he
expected
in
his
wife
he
was
as
it
were
cut
to
the
quick
and
no
kind
of
agony
could
be
greater
to
him
than
to
see
her
thus
forget
herself
on
this
account
it
may
indeed
be
regretted
that
tebrick
had
been
so
exactly
and
in
particular
that
her
table
manners
had
always
been
scrupulous
had
she
been
in
the
habit
like
a
continental
princess
i
have
dined
with
of
taking
her
leg
of
chicken
by
the
drumstick
and
gnawing
the
flesh
it
had
been
far
better
for
him
now
but
as
her
manners
had
been
perfect
so
the
lapse
of
them
was
proportionately
painful
to
him
thus
in
this
instance
he
stood
as
it
were
in
silent
agony
till
she
had
finished
her
hideous
crunching
of
the
chicken
bones
and
had
devoured
every
scrap
then
he
spoke
to
her
gently
taking
her
on
to
his
knee
stroking
her
fur
and
fed
her
with
a
few
grapes
saying
to
her
silvia
silvia
is
it
so
hard
for
you
try
and
remember
the
past
my
darling
and
by
living
with
me
we
will
quite
forget
that
you
are
no
longer
a
woman
surely
this
affliction
will
pass
soon
as
suddenly
as
it
came
and
it
will
all
seem
to
us
like
an
evil
dream
yet
though
she
appeared
perfectly
sensible
of
his
words
and
gave
him
sorrowful
and
penitent
looks
like
her
old
self
that
same
afternoon
on
taking
her
out
he
had
all
the
difficulty
in
the
world
to
keep
her
from
going
near
the
ducks
there
came
to
him
then
a
thought
that
was
very
disagreeable
to
him
namely
that
he
dare
not
trust
his
wife
alone
with
any
bird
or
she
would
kill
it
and
this
was
the
more
shocking
to
him
to
think
of
since
it
meant
that
he
durst
not
trust
her
as
much
as
a
dog
even
for
we
may
trust
dogs
who
are
familiars
with
all
the
household
pets
nay
more
we
can
put
them
upon
trust
with
anything
and
know
they
will
not
touch
it
not
even
if
they
be
starving
but
things
were
come
to
such
a
pass
with
his
vixen
that
he
dared
not
in
his
heart
trust
her
at
all
yet
she
was
still
in
many
ways
so
much
more
woman
than
fox
that
he
could
talk
to
her
on
any
subject
and
she
would
understand
him
better
far
than
the
oriental
women
who
are
kept
in
subjection
can
ever
understand
their
masters
unless
they
converse
on
the
most
trifling
household
topics
thus
she
understood
excellently
well
the
importance
and
duties
of
religion
she
would
listen
with
approval
in
the
evening
when
he
said
the
lord
prayer
and
was
rigid
in
her
observance
of
the
sabbath
indeed
the
next
day
being
sunday
he
thinking
no
harm
proposed
their
usual
game
of
piquet
but
no
she
would
not
play
tebrick
not
understanding
at
first
what
she
meant
though
he
was
usually
very
quick
with
her
he
proposed
it
to
her
again
which
she
again
refused
and
this
time
to
show
her
meaning
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
her
paw
this
exceedingly
rejoiced
and
comforted
him
in
his
distress
he
begged
her
pardon
and
fervently
thanked
god
for
having
so
good
a
wife
who
in
spite
of
all
knew
more
of
her
duty
to
god
than
he
did
but
here
i
must
warn
the
reader
from
inferring
that
she
was
a
papist
because
she
then
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
she
made
that
sign
to
my
thinking
only
on
compulsion
because
she
could
not
express
herself
except
in
that
way
for
she
had
been
brought
up
as
a
true
protestant
and
that
she
still
was
one
is
confirmed
by
her
objection
to
cards
which
would
have
been
less
than
nothing
to
her
had
she
been
a
papist
yet
that
evening
taking
her
into
the
drawing
room
so
that
he
might
play
her
some
sacred
music
he
found
her
after
some
time
cowering
away
from
him
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
her
ears
flattened
back
and
an
expression
of
the
greatest
anguish
in
her
eyes
when
he
spoke
to
her
she
licked
his
hand
but
remained
shivering
for
a
long
time
at
his
feet
and
showed
the
clearest
symptoms
of
terror
if
he
so
much
as
moved
towards
the
piano
on
seeing
this
and
recollecting
how
ill
the
ears
of
a
dog
can
bear
with
our
music
and
how
this
dislike
might
be
expected
to
be
even
greater
in
a
fox
all
of
whose
senses
are
more
acute
from
being
a
wild
creature
recollecting
this
he
closed
the
piano
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
locked
up
the
room
and
never
went
into
it
again
he
could
not
help
marvelling
though
since
it
was
but
two
days
after
she
had
herself
led
him
there
and
even
picked
out
for
him
to
play
and
sing
those
pieces
which
were
her
favourites
that
night
she
would
not
sleep
with
him
neither
in
the
bed
nor
on
it
so
that
he
was
forced
to
let
her
curl
herself
up
on
the
floor
but
neither
would
she
sleep
there
for
several
times
she
woke
him
by
trotting
around
the
room
and
once
when
he
had
got
sound
asleep
by
springing
on
the
bed
and
then
off
it
so
that
he
woke
with
a
violent
start
and
cried
out
but
got
no
answer
either
except
hearing
her
trotting
round
and
round
the
room
presently
he
imagines
to
himself
that
she
must
want
something
and
so
fetches
her
food
and
water
but
she
never
so
much
as
looks
at
it
but
still
goes
on
her
rounds
every
now
and
then
scratching
at
the
door
though
he
spoke
to
her
calling
her
by
her
name
she
would
pay
no
heed
to
him
or
else
only
for
the
moment
at
last
he
gave
her
up
and
said
to
her
plainly
the
fit
is
on
you
now
silvia
to
be
a
fox
but
i
shall
keep
you
close
and
in
the
morning
you
will
recollect
yourself
and
thank
me
for
having
kept
you
now
so
he
lay
down
again
but
not
to
sleep
only
to
listen
to
his
wife
running
about
the
room
and
trying
to
get
out
of
it
thus
he
spent
what
was
perhaps
the
most
miserable
night
of
his
existence
in
the
morning
she
was
still
restless
and
was
reluctant
to
let
him
wash
and
brush
her
and
appeared
to
dislike
being
scented
but
as
it
were
to
bear
with
it
for
his
sake
ordinarily
she
had
taken
the
greatest
pleasure
imaginable
in
her
toilet
so
that
on
this
account
added
to
his
sleepless
night
tebrick
was
utterly
dejected
and
it
was
then
that
he
resolved
to
put
a
project
into
execution
that
would
show
him
so
he
thought
whether
he
had
a
wife
or
only
a
wild
vixen
in
his
house
but
yet
he
was
comforted
that
she
bore
at
all
with
him
though
so
restlessly
that
he
did
not
spare
her
calling
her
a
bad
wild
fox
and
then
speaking
to
her
in
this
manner
are
you
not
ashamed
silvia
to
be
such
a
madcap
such
a
wicked
hoyden
you
who
were
particular
in
dress
i
see
it
was
all
vanity
now
you
have
not
your
former
advantages
you
think
nothing
of
decency
his
words
had
some
effect
with
her
too
and
with
himself
so
that
by
the
time
he
had
finished
dressing
her
they
were
both
in
the
lowest
state
of
spirits
imaginable
and
neither
of
them
far
from
tears
breakfast
she
took
soberly
enough
and
after
that
he
went
about
getting
his
experiment
ready
which
was
this
in
the
garden
he
gathered
together
a
nosegay
of
snowdrops
those
being
all
the
flowers
he
could
find
and
then
going
into
the
village
of
stokoe
bought
a
dutch
rabbit
that
is
a
black
and
white
one
from
a
man
there
who
kept
them
when
he
got
back
he
took
her
flowers
and
at
the
same
time
set
down
the
basket
with
the
rabbit
in
it
with
the
lid
open
then
he
called
to
her
silvia
i
have
brought
some
flowers
for
you
look
the
first
snowdrops
at
this
she
ran
up
very
prettily
and
never
giving
as
much
as
one
glance
at
the
rabbit
which
had
hopped
out
of
its
basket
she
began
to
thank
him
for
the
flowers
indeed
she
seemed
indefatigable
in
shewing
her
gratitude
smelt
them
stood
a
little
way
off
looking
at
them
then
thanked
him
again
tebrick
and
this
was
all
part
of
his
plan
then
took
a
vase
and
went
to
find
some
water
for
them
but
left
the
flowers
beside
her
he
stopped
away
five
minutes
timing
it
by
his
watch
and
listening
very
intently
but
never
heard
the
rabbit
squeak
yet
when
he
went
in
what
a
horrid
shambles
was
spread
before
his
eyes
blood
on
the
carpet
blood
on
the
armchairs
and
antimacassars
even
a
little
blood
spurtled
on
to
the
wall
and
what
was
worse
tebrick
tearing
and
growling
over
a
piece
of
the
skin
and
the
legs
for
she
had
eaten
up
all
the
rest
of
it
the
poor
gentleman
was
so
heartbroken
over
this
that
he
was
like
to
have
done
himself
an
injury
and
at
one
moment
thought
of
getting
his
gun
to
have
shot
himself
and
his
vixen
too
indeed
the
extremity
of
his
grief
was
such
that
it
served
him
a
very
good
turn
for
he
was
so
entirely
unmanned
by
it
that
for
some
time
he
could
do
nothing
but
weep
and
fell
into
a
chair
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
so
kept
weeping
and
groaning
after
he
had
been
some
little
while
employed
in
this
dismal
way
his
vixen
who
had
by
this
time
bolted
down
the
rabbit
skin
head
ears
and
all
came
to
him
and
putting
her
paws
on
his
knees
thrust
her
long
muzzle
into
his
face
and
began
licking
him
but
he
looking
at
her
now
with
different
eyes
and
seeing
her
jaws
still
sprinkled
with
fresh
blood
and
her
claws
full
of
the
rabbit
fleck
would
have
none
of
it
but
though
he
beat
her
off
four
or
five
times
even
to
giving
her
blows
and
kicks
she
still
came
back
to
him
crawling
on
her
belly
and
imploring
his
forgiveness
with
sorrowful
eyes
before
he
had
made
this
rash
experiment
of
the
rabbit
and
the
flowers
he
had
promised
himself
that
if
she
failed
in
it
he
would
have
no
more
feeling
or
compassion
for
her
than
if
she
were
in
truth
a
wild
vixen
out
of
the
woods
this
resolution
though
the
reasons
for
it
had
seemed
to
him
so
very
plain
before
he
now
found
more
difficult
to
carry
out
than
to
decide
on
at
length
after
cursing
her
and
beating
her
off
for
upwards
of
he
admitted
to
himself
that
he
still
did
care
for
her
and
even
loved
her
dearly
in
spite
of
all
whatever
pretence
he
affected
towards
her
when
he
had
acknowledged
this
he
looked
up
at
her
and
met
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
held
out
his
arms
to
her
and
said
oh
silvia
silvia
would
you
had
never
done
this
would
i
had
never
tempted
you
in
a
fatal
hour
does
not
this
butchery
and
eating
of
raw
meat
and
rabbit
fur
disgust
you
are
you
a
monster
in
your
soul
as
well
as
in
your
body
have
you
forgotten
what
it
is
to
be
a
woman
meanwhile
with
every
word
of
his
she
crawled
a
step
nearer
on
her
belly
and
at
last
climbed
sorrowfully
into
his
arms
his
words
then
seemed
to
take
effect
on
her
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
wept
most
penitently
in
his
arms
and
her
body
shook
with
her
sobs
as
if
her
heart
were
breaking
this
sorrow
of
hers
gave
him
the
strangest
mixture
of
pain
and
joy
that
he
had
ever
known
for
his
love
for
her
returning
with
a
rush
he
could
not
bear
to
witness
her
pain
and
yet
must
take
pleasure
in
it
as
it
fed
his
hopes
of
her
one
day
returning
to
be
a
woman
so
the
more
anguish
of
shame
his
vixen
underwent
the
greater
his
hopes
rose
till
his
love
and
pity
for
her
increasing
equally
he
was
almost
wishing
her
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
mere
fox
than
to
suffer
so
much
by
being
at
last
he
looked
about
him
somewhat
dazed
with
so
much
weeping
then
set
his
vixen
down
on
the
ottoman
and
began
to
clean
up
the
room
with
a
heavy
heart
he
fetched
a
pail
of
water
and
washed
out
all
the
stains
of
blood
gathered
up
the
two
antimacassars
and
fetched
clean
ones
from
the
other
rooms
while
he
went
about
this
work
his
vixen
sat
and
watched
him
very
contritely
with
her
nose
between
her
two
front
paws
and
when
he
had
done
he
brought
in
some
luncheon
for
himself
though
it
was
already
late
but
none
for
her
she
having
lately
so
infamously
feasted
but
water
he
gave
her
and
a
bunch
of
grapes
afterwards
she
led
him
to
the
small
tortoiseshell
cabinet
and
would
have
him
open
it
when
he
had
done
so
she
motioned
to
the
portable
stereoscope
which
lay
inside
tebrick
instantly
fell
in
with
her
wish
and
after
a
few
trials
adjusted
it
to
her
vision
thus
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
together
very
happily
looking
through
the
collection
of
views
which
he
had
purchased
of
italy
spain
and
scotland
this
diversion
gave
her
great
apparent
pleasure
and
afforded
him
considerable
comfort
but
that
night
he
could
not
prevail
upon
her
to
sleep
in
bed
with
him
and
finally
allowed
her
to
sleep
on
a
mat
beside
the
bed
where
he
could
stretch
down
and
touch
her
so
they
passed
the
night
with
his
hand
upon
her
head
the
next
morning
he
had
more
of
a
struggle
than
ever
to
wash
and
dress
her
indeed
at
one
time
nothing
but
holding
her
by
the
scruff
prevented
her
from
getting
away
from
him
but
at
last
he
achieved
his
object
and
she
was
washed
brushed
scented
and
dressed
although
to
be
sure
this
left
him
better
pleased
than
her
for
she
regarded
her
silk
jacket
with
disfavour
still
at
breakfast
she
was
well
mannered
though
a
trifle
hasty
with
her
food
then
his
difficulties
with
her
began
for
she
would
go
out
but
as
he
had
his
housework
to
do
he
could
not
allow
it
he
brought
her
picture
books
to
divert
her
but
she
would
have
none
of
them
but
stayed
at
the
door
scratching
it
with
her
claws
industriously
till
she
had
worn
away
the
paint
at
first
he
tried
coaxing
her
and
wheedling
gave
her
cards
to
play
patience
and
so
on
but
finding
nothing
would
distract
her
from
going
out
his
temper
began
to
rise
and
he
told
her
plainly
that
she
must
wait
his
pleasure
and
that
he
had
as
much
natural
obstinacy
as
she
had
but
to
all
that
he
said
she
paid
no
heed
whatever
but
only
scratched
the
harder
thus
he
let
her
continue
until
luncheon
when
she
would
not
sit
up
or
eat
off
a
plate
but
first
was
for
getting
on
to
the
table
and
when
that
was
prevented
snatched
her
meat
and
ate
it
under
the
table
to
all
his
rebukes
she
turned
a
deaf
or
sullen
ear
and
so
they
each
finished
their
meal
eating
little
either
of
them
for
till
she
would
sit
at
table
he
would
give
her
no
more
and
his
vexation
had
taken
away
his
own
appetite
in
the
afternoon
he
took
her
out
for
her
airing
in
the
garden
she
made
no
pretence
now
of
enjoying
the
first
snowdrops
or
the
view
from
the
terrace
no
there
was
only
one
thing
for
her
now
the
ducks
and
she
was
off
to
them
before
he
could
stop
her
luckily
they
were
all
swimming
when
she
got
there
for
a
stream
running
into
the
pond
on
the
far
side
it
was
not
frozen
there
when
he
had
got
down
to
the
pond
she
ran
out
on
to
the
ice
which
would
not
bear
his
weight
and
though
he
called
her
and
begged
her
to
come
back
she
would
not
heed
him
but
stayed
frisking
about
getting
as
near
the
ducks
as
she
dared
but
being
circumspect
in
venturing
on
to
the
thin
ice
presently
she
turned
on
herself
and
began
tearing
off
her
clothes
and
at
last
by
biting
got
off
her
little
jacket
and
taking
it
in
her
mouth
stuffed
it
into
a
hole
in
the
ice
where
he
could
not
get
it
then
she
ran
hither
and
thither
a
stark
naked
vixen
and
without
giving
a
glance
to
her
poor
husband
who
stood
silently
now
upon
the
bank
with
despair
and
terror
settled
in
his
mind
she
let
him
stay
there
most
of
the
afternoon
till
he
was
chilled
through
and
through
and
worn
out
with
watching
her
at
last
he
reflected
how
she
had
just
stripped
herself
and
how
in
the
morning
she
struggled
against
being
dressed
and
he
thought
perhaps
he
was
too
strict
with
her
and
if
he
let
her
have
her
own
way
they
could
manage
to
be
happy
somehow
together
even
if
she
did
eat
off
the
floor
so
he
called
out
to
her
then
silvia
come
now
be
good
you
sha
wear
any
more
clothes
if
you
do
want
to
and
you
need
sit
at
table
neither
i
promise
you
shall
do
as
you
like
in
that
but
you
must
give
up
one
thing
and
that
is
you
must
stay
with
me
and
not
go
out
alone
for
that
is
dangerous
if
any
dog
came
on
you
he
would
kill
you
directly
he
had
finished
speaking
she
came
to
him
joyously
began
fawning
on
him
and
prancing
round
him
so
that
in
spite
of
his
vexation
with
her
and
being
cold
he
could
not
help
stroking
her
oh
silvia
are
you
not
wilful
and
cunning
i
see
you
glory
in
being
so
but
i
shall
not
reproach
you
but
shall
stick
to
my
side
of
the
bargain
and
you
must
stick
to
yours
he
built
a
big
fire
when
he
came
back
to
the
house
and
took
a
glass
or
two
of
spirits
also
to
warm
himself
up
for
he
was
chilled
to
the
very
bone
then
after
they
had
dined
to
cheer
himself
he
took
another
glass
and
then
another
and
so
on
till
he
was
very
merry
he
thought
then
he
would
play
with
his
vixen
she
encouraging
him
with
her
pretty
sportiveness
he
got
up
to
catch
her
then
and
finding
himself
unsteady
on
his
legs
he
went
down
on
to
all
fours
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
by
drinking
he
drowned
all
his
sorrow
and
then
would
be
a
beast
too
like
his
wife
though
she
was
one
through
no
fault
of
her
own
and
could
not
help
it
to
what
lengths
he
went
then
in
that
drunken
humour
i
shall
not
offend
my
readers
by
relating
but
shall
only
say
that
he
was
so
drunk
and
sottish
that
he
had
a
very
imperfect
recollection
of
what
had
passed
when
he
woke
the
next
morning
there
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
if
a
man
drink
heavily
at
night
the
next
morning
will
show
the
other
side
to
his
nature
thus
with
tebrick
for
as
he
had
been
beastly
merry
and
a
very
the
night
before
so
on
his
awakening
was
he
ashamed
melancholic
and
a
true
penitent
before
his
creator
the
first
thing
he
did
when
he
came
to
himself
was
to
call
out
to
god
to
forgive
him
for
his
sin
then
he
fell
into
earnest
prayer
and
continued
so
for
upon
his
knees
then
he
got
up
and
dressed
but
continued
very
melancholy
for
the
whole
of
the
morning
being
in
this
mood
you
may
imagine
it
hurt
him
to
see
his
wife
running
about
naked
but
he
reflected
it
would
be
a
bad
reformation
that
began
with
breaking
faith
he
had
made
a
bargain
and
he
would
stick
to
it
and
so
he
let
her
be
though
sorely
against
his
will
for
the
same
reason
that
is
because
he
would
stick
to
his
side
of
the
bargain
he
did
not
require
her
to
sit
up
at
table
but
gave
her
her
breakfast
on
a
dish
in
the
corner
where
to
tell
the
truth
she
on
her
side
ate
it
all
up
with
great
daintiness
and
propriety
nor
she
did
make
any
attempt
to
go
out
of
doors
that
morning
but
lay
curled
up
in
an
armchair
before
the
fire
dozing
after
lunch
he
took
her
out
and
she
never
so
much
as
offered
to
go
near
the
ducks
but
running
before
him
led
him
on
to
take
her
a
longer
walk
this
he
consented
to
do
very
much
to
her
joy
and
delight
he
took
her
through
the
fields
by
the
most
unfrequented
ways
being
much
alarmed
lest
they
should
be
seen
by
anyone
but
by
good
luck
they
walked
above
four
miles
across
country
and
saw
nobody
all
the
way
his
wife
kept
running
on
ahead
of
him
and
then
back
to
him
to
lick
his
hand
and
so
on
and
appeared
delighted
at
taking
exercise
and
though
they
startled
two
or
three
rabbits
and
a
hare
in
the
course
of
their
walk
she
never
attempted
to
go
after
them
only
giving
them
a
look
and
then
looking
back
to
him
laughing
at
him
as
it
were
for
his
warning
cry
of
puss
come
in
no
nonsense
now
just
when
they
got
home
and
were
going
into
the
porch
they
came
face
to
face
with
an
old
woman
tebrick
stopped
short
in
consternation
and
looked
about
for
his
vixen
but
she
had
run
forward
without
any
shyness
to
greet
her
then
he
recognised
the
intruder
it
was
his
wife
old
nurse
what
are
you
doing
here
mrs
cork
he
asked
her
cork
answered
him
in
these
words
poor
thing
poor
miss
silvia
it
is
a
shame
to
let
her
run
about
like
a
dog
it
is
a
shame
and
your
own
wife
too
but
whatever
she
looks
like
you
should
trust
her
the
same
as
ever
if
you
do
she
do
her
best
to
be
a
good
wife
to
you
if
you
do
i
should
wonder
if
she
did
turn
into
a
proper
fox
i
saw
her
sir
before
i
left
and
i
had
no
peace
of
mind
i
could
sleep
thinking
of
her
so
i
come
back
to
look
after
her
as
i
have
done
all
her
life
sir
and
she
stooped
down
and
took
tebrick
by
the
paw
tebrick
unlocked
the
door
and
they
went
in
when
cork
saw
the
house
she
exclaimed
again
and
again
the
place
was
a
pigstye
they
could
live
like
that
a
gentleman
must
have
somebody
to
look
after
him
she
would
do
it
he
could
trust
her
with
the
secret
had
the
old
woman
come
the
day
before
it
is
likely
enough
that
tebrick
would
have
sent
her
packing
but
the
voice
of
conscience
being
woken
in
him
by
his
drunkenness
of
the
night
before
he
was
heartily
ashamed
of
his
own
management
of
the
business
moreover
the
old
words
that
it
was
a
shame
to
let
her
run
about
like
a
dog
moved
him
exceedingly
being
in
this
mood
the
truth
is
he
welcomed
her
but
we
may
conclude
that
tebrick
was
as
sorry
to
see
her
old
nanny
as
her
husband
was
glad
if
we
consider
that
she
had
been
brought
up
strictly
by
her
when
she
was
a
child
and
was
now
again
in
her
power
and
that
her
old
nurse
could
never
be
satisfied
with
her
now
whatever
she
did
but
would
always
think
her
wicked
to
be
a
fox
at
all
there
seems
good
reason
for
her
dislike
and
it
is
possible
too
that
there
may
have
been
another
cause
as
well
and
that
is
jealousy
we
know
her
husband
was
always
trying
to
bring
her
back
to
be
a
woman
or
at
any
rate
to
get
her
to
act
like
one
may
she
not
have
been
hoping
to
get
him
to
be
like
a
beast
himself
or
to
act
like
one
may
she
not
have
thought
it
easier
to
change
him
thus
than
ever
to
change
herself
back
into
being
a
woman
if
we
think
that
she
had
had
a
success
of
this
kind
only
the
night
before
when
he
got
drunk
can
we
not
conclude
that
this
was
indeed
the
case
and
then
we
have
another
good
reason
why
the
poor
lady
should
hate
to
see
her
old
nurse
it
is
certain
that
whatever
hopes
tebrick
had
of
cork
affecting
his
wife
for
the
better
were
disappointed
she
grew
steadily
wilder
and
after
a
few
days
so
intractable
with
her
that
tebrick
again
took
her
under
his
complete
control
the
first
morning
cork
made
her
a
new
jacket
cutting
down
the
sleeves
of
a
blue
silk
one
of
tebrick
and
trimming
it
with
down
and
directly
she
had
altered
it
put
it
on
her
mistress
and
fetching
a
mirror
would
have
her
admire
the
fit
of
it
all
the
time
she
waited
on
tebrick
the
old
woman
talked
to
her
as
though
she
were
a
baby
and
treated
her
as
such
never
thinking
perhaps
that
she
was
either
the
one
thing
or
the
other
that
is
either
a
lady
to
whom
she
owed
respect
and
who
had
rational
powers
exceeding
her
own
or
else
a
wild
creature
on
whom
words
were
wasted
but
though
at
first
she
submitted
passively
tebrick
only
waited
for
her
nanny
back
to
be
turned
to
tear
up
her
pretty
piece
of
handiwork
into
shreds
and
then
ran
gaily
about
waving
her
brush
with
only
a
few
ribands
still
hanging
from
her
neck
so
it
was
time
after
time
for
the
old
woman
was
used
to
having
her
own
way
until
cork
would
i
think
have
tried
punishing
her
if
she
had
not
been
afraid
of
tebrick
rows
of
white
teeth
which
she
often
showed
her
then
laughing
afterwards
as
if
to
say
it
was
only
play
not
content
with
tearing
off
the
dresses
that
were
fitted
on
her
one
day
silvia
slipped
upstairs
to
her
wardrobe
and
tore
down
all
her
old
dresses
and
made
havoc
with
them
not
sparing
her
wedding
dress
either
but
tearing
and
ripping
them
all
up
so
that
there
was
hardly
a
shred
or
rag
left
big
enough
to
dress
a
doll
in
on
this
tebrick
who
had
let
the
old
woman
have
most
of
her
management
to
see
what
she
could
make
of
her
took
her
back
under
his
own
control
he
was
sorry
enough
now
that
cork
had
disappointed
him
in
the
hopes
he
had
had
of
her
to
have
the
old
woman
as
it
were
on
his
hands
true
she
could
be
useful
enough
in
many
ways
to
him
by
doing
the
housework
the
cooking
and
mending
but
still
he
was
anxious
since
his
secret
was
in
her
keeping
and
the
more
now
that
she
had
tried
her
hand
with
his
wife
and
failed
for
he
saw
that
vanity
had
kept
her
mouth
shut
if
she
had
won
over
her
mistress
to
better
ways
and
her
love
for
her
would
have
grown
by
getting
her
own
way
with
her
but
now
that
she
had
failed
she
bore
her
mistress
a
grudge
for
not
being
won
over
or
at
the
best
was
become
indifferent
to
the
business
so
that
she
might
very
readily
blab
for
the
moment
all
tebrick
could
do
was
to
keep
her
from
going
into
stokoe
to
the
village
where
she
would
meet
all
her
old
cronies
and
where
there
were
certain
to
be
any
number
of
inquiries
about
what
was
going
on
at
rylands
and
so
on
but
as
he
saw
that
it
was
clearly
beyond
his
power
however
vigilant
he
might
be
to
watch
over
the
old
woman
and
his
wife
and
to
prevent
anyone
from
meeting
with
either
of
them
he
began
to
consider
what
he
could
best
do
since
he
had
sent
away
his
servants
and
the
gardener
giving
out
a
story
of
having
received
bad
news
and
his
wife
going
away
to
london
where
he
would
join
her
their
probably
going
out
of
england
and
so
on
he
knew
well
enough
that
there
would
be
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
the
neighbourhood
and
as
he
had
now
stayed
on
contrary
to
what
he
had
said
there
would
be
further
rumour
indeed
had
he
known
it
there
was
a
story
already
going
round
the
country
that
his
wife
had
run
away
with
major
solmes
and
that
he
was
gone
mad
with
grief
that
he
had
shot
his
dogs
and
his
horses
and
shut
himself
up
alone
in
the
house
and
would
speak
with
no
one
this
story
was
made
up
by
his
neighbours
not
because
they
were
fanciful
or
wanted
to
deceive
but
like
most
to
fill
a
gap
as
few
like
to
confess
ignorance
and
if
people
are
asked
about
such
or
such
a
man
they
must
have
something
to
say
or
they
suffer
in
everybody
opinion
are
set
down
as
dull
or
out
of
the
swim
in
this
way
i
met
not
long
ago
with
someone
who
after
talking
some
little
while
and
not
knowing
me
or
who
i
was
told
me
that
david
garnett
was
dead
and
died
of
being
bitten
by
a
cat
after
he
had
tormented
it
he
had
long
grown
a
nuisance
to
his
friends
as
an
exorbitant
sponge
upon
them
and
the
world
was
well
rid
of
him
hearing
this
story
of
myself
diverted
me
at
the
time
but
i
fully
believe
it
has
served
me
in
good
stead
since
for
it
set
me
on
my
guard
as
perhaps
nothing
else
would
have
done
against
accepting
for
true
all
floating
rumour
and
village
gossip
so
that
now
i
am
by
second
nature
a
true
sceptic
and
scarcely
believe
anything
unless
the
evidence
for
it
is
conclusive
indeed
i
could
never
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
this
history
if
i
had
believed
one
tenth
part
of
what
i
was
told
there
was
so
much
of
it
that
was
either
manifestly
false
and
absurd
or
else
contradictory
to
the
ascertained
facts
it
is
therefore
only
the
bare
bones
of
the
story
which
you
will
find
written
here
for
i
have
rejected
all
the
flowery
embroideries
which
would
be
entertaining
reading
enough
i
daresay
for
some
but
if
there
be
any
doubt
of
the
truth
of
a
thing
it
is
poor
sort
of
entertainment
to
read
about
in
my
opinion
to
get
back
to
our
story
tebrick
having
considered
how
much
the
appetite
of
his
neighbours
would
be
whetted
to
find
out
the
mystery
by
his
remaining
in
that
part
of
the
country
determined
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
remove
after
some
time
turning
the
thing
over
in
his
mind
he
decided
that
no
place
would
be
so
good
for
his
purpose
as
old
nanny
cottage
it
was
thirty
miles
away
from
stokoe
which
in
the
country
means
as
far
as
timbuctoo
does
to
us
in
london
then
it
was
near
tangley
and
his
lady
having
known
it
from
her
childhood
would
feel
at
home
there
and
also
it
was
utterly
remote
there
being
no
village
near
it
or
manor
house
other
than
tangley
hall
which
was
now
untenanted
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
nor
did
it
mean
imparting
his
secret
to
others
for
there
was
only
cork
son
a
widower
who
being
out
at
work
all
day
would
be
easily
outwitted
the
more
so
as
he
was
stone
deaf
and
of
a
slow
and
saturnine
disposition
to
be
sure
there
was
little
polly
granddaughter
but
either
tebrick
forgot
her
altogether
or
else
reckoned
her
as
a
mere
baby
and
not
to
be
thought
of
as
a
danger
he
talked
the
thing
over
with
cork
and
they
decided
upon
it
out
of
hand
the
truth
is
the
old
woman
was
beginning
to
regret
that
her
love
and
her
curiosity
had
ever
brought
her
back
to
rylands
since
so
far
she
had
got
much
work
and
little
credit
by
it
when
it
was
settled
tebrick
disposed
of
the
remaining
business
he
had
at
rylands
in
the
afternoon
and
that
was
chiefly
putting
out
his
wife
riding
horse
into
the
keeping
of
a
farmer
near
by
for
he
thought
he
would
drive
over
with
his
own
horse
and
the
other
spare
horse
tandem
in
the
dogcart
the
next
morning
they
locked
up
the
house
and
they
departed
having
first
secured
tebrick
in
a
large
wicker
hamper
where
she
would
be
tolerably
comfortable
this
was
for
safety
for
in
the
agitation
of
driving
she
might
jump
out
and
on
the
other
hand
if
a
dog
scented
her
and
she
were
loose
she
might
be
in
danger
of
her
life
tebrick
drove
with
the
hamper
beside
him
on
the
front
seat
and
spoke
to
her
gently
very
often
she
was
overcome
by
the
excitement
of
the
journey
and
kept
poking
her
nose
first
through
one
crevice
then
through
another
turning
and
twisting
the
whole
time
and
peeping
out
to
see
what
they
were
passing
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
day
and
when
they
had
gone
about
fifteen
miles
they
drew
up
by
the
roadside
to
rest
the
horses
and
have
their
own
luncheon
for
he
dared
not
stop
at
an
inn
he
knew
that
any
living
creature
in
a
hamper
even
if
it
be
only
an
old
fowl
always
draws
attention
there
would
be
several
loafers
most
likely
who
would
notice
that
he
had
a
fox
with
him
and
even
if
he
left
the
hamper
in
the
cart
the
dogs
at
the
inn
would
be
sure
to
sniff
out
her
scent
so
not
to
take
any
chances
he
drew
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
rested
there
though
it
was
freezing
hard
and
a
wind
howling
he
took
down
his
precious
hamper
unharnessed
his
two
horses
covered
them
with
rugs
and
gave
them
their
corn
then
he
opened
the
basket
and
let
his
wife
out
she
was
quite
beside
herself
with
joy
running
hither
and
thither
bouncing
up
on
him
looking
about
her
and
even
rolling
over
on
the
ground
tebrick
took
this
to
mean
that
she
was
glad
at
making
this
journey
and
rejoiced
equally
with
her
as
for
cork
she
sat
motionless
on
the
back
seat
of
the
dogcart
well
wrapped
up
eating
her
sandwiches
but
would
not
speak
a
word
when
they
had
stayed
there
tebrick
harnessed
the
horses
again
though
he
was
so
cold
he
could
scarcely
buckle
the
straps
and
put
his
vixen
in
her
basket
but
seeing
that
she
wanted
to
look
about
her
he
let
her
tear
away
the
osiers
with
her
teeth
till
she
had
made
a
hole
big
enough
for
her
to
put
her
head
out
of
they
drove
on
again
and
then
the
snow
began
to
come
down
and
that
in
earnest
so
that
he
began
to
be
afraid
they
would
never
cover
the
ground
but
just
after
nightfall
they
got
in
and
he
was
content
to
leave
unharnessing
the
horses
and
baiting
them
to
simon
son
his
vixen
was
tired
by
then
as
well
as
he
and
they
slept
together
he
in
the
bed
and
she
under
it
very
contentedly
the
next
morning
he
looked
about
him
at
the
place
and
found
the
thing
there
that
he
most
wanted
and
that
was
a
little
garden
where
his
wife
could
run
in
freedom
and
yet
be
in
safety
after
they
had
had
breakfast
she
was
wild
to
go
out
into
the
snow
so
they
went
out
together
and
he
had
never
seen
such
a
mad
creature
in
all
his
life
as
his
wife
was
then
for
she
ran
to
and
fro
as
if
she
were
crazy
biting
at
the
snow
and
rolling
in
it
and
round
and
round
in
circles
and
rushed
back
at
him
fiercely
as
if
she
meant
to
bite
him
he
joined
her
in
the
frolic
and
began
snowballing
her
till
she
was
so
wild
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
quiet
her
again
and
bring
her
indoors
for
luncheon
indeed
with
her
gambollings
she
tracked
the
whole
garden
over
with
her
feet
he
could
see
where
she
had
rolled
in
the
snow
and
where
she
had
danced
in
it
and
looking
at
those
prints
of
her
feet
as
they
went
in
made
his
heart
ache
he
knew
not
why
they
passed
the
first
day
at
old
nanny
cottage
happily
enough
without
their
usual
bickerings
and
this
because
of
the
novelty
of
the
snow
which
had
diverted
them
in
the
afternoon
he
first
showed
his
wife
to
little
polly
who
eyed
her
very
curiously
but
hung
back
shyly
and
seemed
a
good
deal
afraid
of
the
fox
but
tebrick
took
up
a
book
and
let
them
get
acquainted
by
themselves
and
presently
looking
up
saw
that
they
had
come
together
and
polly
was
stroking
his
wife
patting
her
and
running
her
fingers
through
her
fur
presently
she
began
talking
to
the
fox
and
then
brought
her
doll
in
to
show
her
so
that
very
soon
they
were
very
good
playmates
together
watching
the
two
gave
tebrick
great
delight
and
in
particular
when
he
noticed
that
there
was
something
very
motherly
in
his
vixen
she
was
indeed
far
above
the
child
in
intelligence
and
restrained
herself
too
from
any
hasty
action
but
while
she
seemed
to
wait
on
polly
pleasure
yet
she
managed
to
give
a
twist
to
the
game
whatever
it
was
that
never
failed
to
delight
the
little
girl
in
short
in
a
very
little
while
polly
was
so
taken
with
her
new
playmate
that
she
cried
when
she
was
parted
from
her
and
wanted
her
always
with
her
this
disposition
of
tebrick
made
cork
more
agreeable
than
she
had
been
lately
either
to
the
husband
or
the
wife
three
days
after
they
had
come
to
the
cottage
the
weather
changed
and
they
woke
up
one
morning
to
find
the
snow
gone
and
the
wind
in
the
south
and
the
sun
shining
so
that
it
was
like
the
first
beginning
of
spring
tebrick
let
his
vixen
out
into
the
garden
after
breakfast
stayed
with
her
awhile
and
then
went
indoors
to
write
some
letters
when
he
got
out
again
he
could
see
no
sign
of
her
anywhere
so
that
he
ran
about
bewildered
calling
to
her
at
last
he
spied
a
mound
of
fresh
earth
by
the
wall
in
one
corner
of
the
garden
and
running
thither
found
that
there
was
a
hole
freshly
dug
seeming
to
go
under
the
wall
on
this
he
ran
out
of
the
garden
quickly
till
he
came
to
the
other
side
of
the
wall
but
there
was
no
hole
there
so
he
concluded
that
she
was
not
yet
got
through
so
it
proved
to
be
for
reaching
down
into
the
hole
he
felt
her
brush
with
his
hand
and
could
hear
her
distinctly
working
away
with
her
claws
he
called
to
her
then
saying
silvia
silvia
why
do
you
do
this
are
you
trying
to
escape
from
me
i
am
your
husband
and
if
i
keep
you
confined
it
is
to
protect
you
not
to
let
you
run
into
danger
show
me
how
i
can
make
you
happy
and
i
will
do
it
but
do
not
try
to
escape
from
me
i
love
you
silvia
is
it
because
of
that
that
you
want
to
fly
from
me
to
go
into
the
world
where
you
will
be
in
danger
of
your
life
always
there
are
dogs
everywhere
and
they
all
would
kill
you
if
it
were
not
for
me
come
out
silvia
come
out
but
silvia
would
not
listen
to
him
so
he
waited
there
silent
then
he
spoke
to
her
in
a
different
way
asking
her
had
she
forgot
the
bargain
she
made
with
him
that
she
would
not
go
out
alone
but
now
when
she
had
all
the
liberty
of
a
garden
to
herself
would
she
wantonly
break
her
word
and
he
asked
her
were
they
not
married
and
had
she
not
always
found
him
a
good
husband
to
her
but
she
heeded
this
neither
until
presently
his
temper
getting
somewhat
out
of
hand
he
cursed
her
obstinacy
and
told
her
if
she
would
be
a
damned
fox
she
was
welcome
to
it
for
his
part
he
could
get
his
own
way
she
had
not
escaped
yet
he
would
dig
her
out
for
he
still
had
time
and
if
she
struggled
put
her
in
a
bag
these
words
brought
her
forth
instantly
and
she
looked
at
him
with
as
much
astonishment
as
if
she
knew
not
what
could
have
made
him
angry
yes
she
even
fawned
on
him
but
in
a
kind
of
way
as
if
she
were
a
very
good
wife
putting
up
wonderfully
with
her
temper
these
airs
of
hers
made
the
poor
gentleman
so
simple
was
he
repent
his
outburst
and
feel
most
ashamed
but
for
all
that
when
she
was
out
of
the
hole
he
filled
it
up
with
great
stones
and
beat
them
in
with
a
crowbar
so
she
should
find
her
work
at
that
point
harder
than
before
if
she
was
tempted
to
begin
it
again
in
the
afternoon
he
let
her
go
again
into
the
garden
but
sent
little
polly
with
her
to
keep
her
company
but
presently
on
looking
out
he
saw
his
vixen
had
climbed
up
into
the
limbs
of
an
old
pear
tree
and
was
looking
over
the
wall
and
was
not
so
far
from
it
but
she
might
jump
over
it
if
she
could
get
a
little
further
tebrick
ran
out
into
the
garden
as
quick
as
he
could
and
when
his
wife
saw
him
it
seemed
she
was
startled
and
made
a
false
spring
at
the
wall
so
that
she
missed
reaching
it
and
fell
back
heavily
to
the
ground
and
lay
there
insensible
when
tebrick
got
up
to
her
he
found
her
head
was
twisted
under
her
by
her
fall
and
the
neck
seemed
to
be
broken
the
shock
was
so
great
to
him
that
for
some
time
he
could
not
do
anything
but
knelt
beside
her
turning
her
limp
body
stupidly
in
his
hands
at
length
he
recognised
that
she
was
indeed
dead
and
beginning
to
consider
what
dreadful
afflictions
god
had
visited
him
with
he
blasphemed
horribly
and
called
on
god
to
strike
him
dead
or
give
his
wife
back
to
him
is
it
not
enough
he
cried
adding
a
foul
blasphemous
oath
that
you
should
rob
me
of
my
dear
wife
making
her
a
fox
but
now
you
must
rob
me
of
that
fox
too
that
has
been
my
only
solace
and
comfort
in
this
affliction
then
he
burst
into
tears
and
began
wringing
his
hands
and
continued
there
in
such
an
extremity
of
grief
for
that
he
cared
nothing
neither
what
he
was
doing
nor
what
would
become
of
him
in
the
future
but
only
knew
that
his
life
was
ended
now
and
he
would
not
live
any
longer
than
he
could
help
all
this
while
the
little
girl
polly
stood
by
first
staring
then
asking
him
what
had
happened
and
lastly
crying
with
fear
but
he
never
heeded
her
nor
looked
at
her
but
only
tore
his
hair
sometimes
shouted
at
god
or
shook
his
fist
at
heaven
so
in
a
fright
polly
opened
the
door
and
ran
out
of
the
garden
at
length
worn
out
and
as
it
were
all
numb
with
his
loss
tebrick
got
up
and
went
within
doors
leaving
his
dear
fox
lying
near
where
she
had
fallen
he
stayed
indoors
only
two
minutes
and
then
came
out
again
with
a
razor
in
his
hand
intending
to
cut
his
own
throat
for
he
was
out
of
his
senses
in
this
first
paroxysm
of
grief
but
his
vixen
was
gone
at
which
he
looked
about
for
a
moment
bewildered
and
then
enraged
thinking
that
somebody
must
have
taken
the
body
the
door
of
the
garden
being
open
he
ran
straight
through
it
now
this
door
which
had
been
left
ajar
by
polly
when
she
ran
off
opened
into
a
little
courtyard
where
the
fowls
were
shut
in
at
night
the
woodhouse
and
the
privy
also
stood
there
on
the
far
side
of
it
from
the
garden
gate
were
two
large
wooden
doors
big
enough
when
open
to
let
a
cart
enter
and
high
enough
to
keep
a
man
from
looking
over
into
the
yard
when
tebrick
got
into
the
yard
he
found
his
vixen
leaping
up
at
these
doors
and
wild
with
terror
but
as
lively
as
ever
he
saw
her
in
his
life
he
ran
up
to
her
but
she
shrank
away
from
him
and
would
then
have
dodged
him
too
but
he
caught
hold
of
her
she
bared
her
teeth
at
him
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
that
only
picked
her
straight
up
into
his
arms
and
took
her
so
indoors
yet
all
the
while
he
could
scarce
believe
his
eyes
to
see
her
living
and
felt
her
all
over
very
carefully
to
find
if
she
had
not
some
bones
broken
but
no
he
could
find
none
indeed
it
was
some
hours
before
this
poor
silly
gentleman
began
to
suspect
the
truth
which
was
that
his
vixen
had
practised
a
deception
upon
him
and
all
the
time
he
was
bemoaning
his
loss
in
such
heartrending
terms
she
was
only
shamming
death
to
run
away
directly
she
was
able
if
it
had
not
been
that
the
yard
gates
were
shut
which
was
a
mere
chance
she
had
got
her
liberty
by
that
trick
and
that
this
was
only
a
trick
of
hers
to
sham
dead
was
plain
when
he
had
thought
it
over
indeed
it
is
an
old
and
trick
of
the
fox
it
is
in
aesop
and
a
hundred
other
writers
have
confirmed
it
since
but
so
thoroughly
had
he
been
deceived
by
her
that
at
first
he
was
as
much
overcome
with
joy
at
his
wife
still
being
alive
as
he
had
been
with
grief
a
little
while
before
thinking
her
dead
he
took
her
in
his
arms
hugging
her
to
him
and
thanking
god
a
dozen
times
for
her
preservation
but
his
kissing
and
fondling
her
had
very
little
effect
now
for
she
did
not
answer
him
by
licking
or
soft
looks
but
stayed
huddled
up
and
sullen
with
her
hair
bristling
on
her
neck
and
her
ears
laid
back
every
time
he
touched
her
at
first
he
thought
this
might
be
because
he
had
touched
some
broken
bone
or
tender
place
where
she
had
been
hurt
but
at
last
the
truth
came
to
him
thus
he
was
again
to
suffer
and
though
the
pain
of
knowing
her
treachery
to
him
was
nothing
to
the
grief
of
losing
her
yet
it
was
more
insidious
and
lasting
at
first
from
a
mere
nothing
this
pain
grew
gradually
until
it
was
a
torture
to
him
if
he
had
been
one
of
your
stock
ordinary
husbands
such
a
one
who
by
experience
has
learnt
never
to
enquire
too
closely
into
his
wife
doings
her
comings
or
goings
and
never
to
ask
her
how
she
has
spent
the
day
for
fear
he
should
be
made
the
more
of
a
fool
had
tebrick
been
such
a
one
he
had
been
luckier
and
his
pain
would
have
been
almost
nothing
but
you
must
consider
that
he
had
never
been
deceived
once
by
his
wife
in
the
course
of
their
married
life
no
she
had
never
told
him
as
much
as
one
white
lie
but
had
always
been
frank
open
and
ingenuous
as
if
she
and
her
husband
were
not
husband
and
wife
or
indeed
of
opposite
sexes
yet
we
must
rate
him
as
very
foolish
that
living
thus
with
a
fox
which
beast
has
the
same
reputation
for
deceitfulness
craft
and
cunning
in
all
countries
all
ages
and
amongst
all
races
of
mankind
he
should
expect
this
fox
to
be
as
candid
and
honest
with
him
in
all
things
as
the
country
girl
he
had
married
his
wife
sullenness
and
bad
temper
continued
that
day
for
she
cowered
away
from
him
and
hid
under
the
sofa
nor
could
he
persuade
her
to
come
out
from
there
even
when
it
was
her
dinner
time
she
stayed
refusing
resolutely
to
be
tempted
out
with
food
and
lying
so
quiet
that
he
heard
nothing
from
her
for
hours
at
night
he
carried
her
up
to
the
bedroom
but
she
was
still
sullen
and
refused
to
eat
a
morsel
though
she
drank
a
little
water
during
the
night
when
she
fancied
he
was
asleep
the
next
morning
was
the
same
and
by
now
tebrick
had
been
through
all
the
agonies
of
wounded
disillusionment
and
despair
that
a
man
can
suffer
but
though
his
emotions
rose
up
in
his
heart
and
nearly
stifled
him
he
showed
no
sign
of
them
to
her
neither
did
he
abate
one
jot
his
tenderness
and
consideration
for
his
vixen
at
breakfast
he
tempted
her
with
a
freshly
killed
young
pullet
it
hurt
him
to
make
this
advance
to
her
for
hitherto
he
had
kept
her
strictly
on
cooked
meats
but
the
pain
of
seeing
her
refuse
it
was
harder
still
for
him
to
bear
added
to
this
was
now
an
anxiety
lest
she
should
starve
herself
to
death
rather
than
stay
with
him
any
longer
all
that
morning
he
kept
her
close
but
in
the
afternoon
let
her
loose
again
in
the
garden
after
he
had
lopped
the
pear
tree
so
that
she
could
not
repeat
her
performance
of
climbing
but
seeing
how
disgustedly
she
looked
while
he
was
by
never
offering
to
run
or
to
play
as
she
was
used
but
only
standing
stock
still
with
her
tail
between
her
legs
her
ears
flattened
and
the
hair
bristling
on
her
shoulders
seeing
this
he
left
her
to
herself
out
of
mere
humanity
when
he
came
out
after
he
found
that
she
was
gone
but
there
was
a
fair
sized
hole
by
the
wall
and
she
just
buried
all
but
her
brush
digging
desperately
to
get
under
the
wall
and
make
her
escape
he
ran
up
to
the
hole
and
put
his
arm
in
after
her
and
called
to
her
to
come
out
but
she
would
not
so
at
first
he
began
pulling
her
out
by
the
shoulder
then
his
hold
slipping
by
the
hind
legs
as
soon
as
he
had
drawn
her
forth
she
whipped
round
and
snapped
at
his
hand
and
bit
it
through
near
the
joint
of
the
thumb
but
let
it
go
instantly
they
stayed
there
for
a
minute
facing
each
other
he
on
his
knees
and
she
facing
him
the
picture
of
unrepentant
wickedness
and
fury
being
thus
on
his
knees
tebrick
was
down
on
her
level
very
nearly
and
her
muzzle
was
thrust
almost
into
his
face
her
ears
lay
flat
on
her
head
her
gums
were
bared
in
a
silent
snarl
and
all
her
beautiful
teeth
threatening
him
that
she
would
bite
him
again
her
back
too
was
all
her
hair
bristling
and
her
brush
held
drooping
but
it
was
her
eyes
that
held
his
with
their
slit
pupils
looking
at
him
with
savage
desperation
and
rage
the
blood
ran
very
freely
from
his
hand
but
he
never
noticed
that
or
the
pain
of
it
either
for
all
his
thoughts
were
for
his
wife
what
is
this
silvia
he
said
very
quietly
what
is
this
why
are
you
so
savage
now
if
i
stand
between
you
and
your
freedom
it
is
because
i
love
you
is
it
such
torment
to
be
with
me
but
silvia
never
stirred
a
muscle
you
would
not
do
this
if
you
were
not
in
anguish
poor
beast
you
want
your
freedom
i
can
not
keep
you
i
can
not
hold
you
to
vows
made
when
you
were
a
woman
why
you
have
forgotten
who
i
am
the
tears
then
began
running
down
his
cheeks
he
sobbed
and
said
to
her
go
i
shall
not
keep
you
poor
beast
poor
beast
i
love
you
i
love
you
go
if
you
want
to
but
if
you
remember
me
come
back
i
shall
never
keep
you
against
your
will
go
go
but
kiss
me
now
he
leant
forward
then
and
put
his
lips
to
her
snarling
fangs
but
though
she
kept
snarling
she
did
not
bite
him
then
he
got
up
quickly
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
garden
that
opened
into
a
little
paddock
against
a
wood
when
he
opened
it
she
went
through
it
like
an
arrow
crossed
the
paddock
like
a
puff
of
smoke
and
in
a
moment
was
gone
from
his
sight
then
suddenly
finding
himself
alone
tebrick
came
as
it
were
to
himself
and
ran
after
her
calling
her
by
name
and
shouting
to
her
and
so
went
plunging
into
the
wood
and
through
it
for
about
a
mile
running
almost
blindly
at
last
when
he
was
worn
out
he
sat
down
seeing
that
she
had
gone
beyond
recovery
and
it
was
already
night
then
rising
he
walked
slowly
homewards
wearied
and
spent
in
spirit
as
he
went
he
bound
up
his
hand
that
was
still
running
with
blood
his
coat
was
torn
his
hat
lost
and
his
face
scratched
right
across
with
briars
now
in
cold
blood
he
began
to
reflect
on
what
he
had
done
and
to
repent
bitterly
having
set
his
wife
free
he
had
betrayed
her
so
that
now
from
his
act
she
must
lead
the
life
of
a
wild
fox
for
ever
and
must
undergo
all
the
rigours
and
hardships
of
the
climate
and
all
the
hazards
of
a
hunted
creature
when
tebrick
got
back
to
the
cottage
he
found
cork
was
sitting
up
for
him
it
was
already
late
what
have
you
done
with
tebrick
sir
i
missed
her
and
i
missed
you
and
i
have
not
known
what
to
do
expecting
something
dreadful
had
happened
i
have
been
sitting
up
for
you
half
the
night
and
where
is
she
now
sir
she
accosted
him
so
vigorously
that
tebrick
stood
silent
at
length
he
said
i
have
let
her
go
she
has
run
away
poor
miss
silvia
cried
the
old
woman
poor
creature
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
sir
let
her
go
indeed
poor
lady
is
that
the
way
for
her
husband
to
talk
it
is
a
disgrace
but
i
saw
it
coming
from
the
first
the
old
woman
was
white
with
fury
she
did
not
mind
what
she
said
but
tebrick
was
not
listening
to
her
at
last
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
that
she
had
just
begun
to
cry
so
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
up
to
bed
and
lay
down
as
he
was
in
his
clothes
utterly
exhausted
and
fell
into
a
dog
sleep
starting
up
every
now
and
then
with
horror
and
then
falling
back
with
fatigue
it
was
late
when
he
woke
up
but
cold
and
raw
and
he
felt
cramped
in
all
his
limbs
as
he
lay
he
heard
again
the
noise
which
had
woken
him
the
trotting
of
several
horses
and
the
voices
of
men
riding
by
the
house
tebrick
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
window
and
then
looked
out
and
the
first
thing
that
he
saw
was
a
gentleman
in
a
pink
coat
riding
at
a
walk
down
the
lane
at
this
sight
tebrick
waited
no
longer
but
pulling
on
his
boots
in
mad
haste
ran
out
instantly
meaning
to
say
that
they
must
not
hunt
and
how
his
wife
was
escaped
and
they
might
kill
her
but
when
he
found
himself
outside
the
cottage
words
failed
him
and
fury
took
possession
of
him
so
that
he
could
only
cry
out
how
dare
you
you
damned
blackguard
and
so
with
a
stick
in
his
hand
he
threw
himself
on
the
gentleman
in
the
pink
coat
and
seized
his
horse
rein
and
catching
the
gentleman
by
the
leg
was
trying
to
throw
him
but
really
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
tebrick
intended
by
his
behaviour
or
what
he
would
have
done
for
the
gentleman
finding
himself
suddenly
assaulted
in
so
unexpected
a
fashion
by
so
strange
a
touzled
and
dishevelled
figure
clubbed
his
hunting
crop
and
dealt
him
a
blow
on
the
temple
so
that
he
fell
insensible
another
gentleman
rode
up
at
this
moment
and
they
were
civil
enough
to
dismount
and
carry
tebrick
into
the
cottage
where
they
were
met
by
old
nanny
who
kept
wringing
her
hands
and
told
them
tebrick
wife
had
run
away
and
she
was
a
vixen
and
that
was
the
cause
that
tebrick
had
run
out
and
assaulted
them
the
two
gentlemen
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
and
mounting
their
horses
rode
on
without
delay
after
telling
each
other
that
tebrick
whoever
he
was
was
certainly
a
madman
and
the
old
woman
seemed
as
mad
as
her
master
this
story
however
went
the
rounds
of
the
gentry
in
those
parts
and
perfectly
confirmed
everyone
in
their
previous
opinion
namely
that
tebrick
was
mad
and
his
wife
had
run
away
from
him
the
part
about
her
being
a
vixen
was
laughed
at
by
the
few
that
heard
it
but
was
soon
left
out
as
immaterial
to
the
story
and
incredible
in
itself
though
afterwards
it
came
to
be
remembered
and
its
significance
to
be
understood
when
tebrick
came
to
himself
it
was
past
noon
and
his
head
was
aching
so
painfully
that
he
could
only
call
to
mind
in
a
confused
way
what
had
happened
however
he
sent
off
cork
son
directly
on
one
of
his
horses
to
enquire
about
the
hunt
at
the
same
time
he
gave
orders
to
old
nanny
that
she
was
to
put
out
food
and
water
for
her
mistress
on
the
chance
that
she
might
yet
be
in
the
neighbourhood
by
nightfall
simon
was
back
with
the
news
that
the
hunt
had
had
a
very
long
run
but
had
lost
one
fox
then
drawing
a
covert
had
chopped
an
old
dog
fox
and
so
ended
the
day
sport
this
put
poor
tebrick
in
some
hopes
again
and
he
rose
at
once
from
his
bed
and
went
out
to
the
wood
and
began
calling
his
wife
but
was
overcome
with
faintness
and
lay
down
and
so
passed
the
night
in
the
open
from
mere
weakness
in
the
morning
he
got
back
again
to
the
cottage
but
he
had
taken
a
chill
and
so
had
to
keep
his
bed
for
three
or
four
days
after
all
this
time
he
had
food
put
out
for
her
every
night
but
though
rats
came
to
it
and
ate
of
it
there
were
never
any
prints
of
a
fox
at
last
his
anxiety
began
working
another
way
that
is
he
came
to
think
it
possible
that
his
vixen
would
have
gone
back
to
stokoe
so
he
had
his
horses
harnessed
in
the
dogcart
and
brought
to
the
door
and
then
drove
over
to
rylands
though
he
was
still
in
a
fever
and
with
a
heavy
cold
upon
him
after
that
he
lived
always
solitary
keeping
away
from
his
fellows
and
only
seeing
one
man
called
askew
who
had
been
brought
up
a
jockey
at
wantage
but
was
grown
too
big
for
his
profession
he
mounted
this
loafing
fellow
on
one
of
his
horses
three
days
a
week
and
had
him
follow
the
hunt
and
report
to
him
whenever
they
killed
and
if
he
could
view
the
fox
so
much
the
better
and
then
he
made
him
describe
it
minutely
so
he
should
know
if
it
were
his
silvia
but
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
go
himself
lest
his
passion
should
master
him
and
he
might
commit
a
murder
every
time
there
was
a
hunt
in
the
neighbourhood
he
set
the
gates
wide
open
at
rylands
and
the
house
doors
also
and
taking
his
gun
stood
sentinel
in
the
hope
that
his
wife
would
run
in
if
she
were
pressed
by
the
hounds
and
so
he
could
save
her
but
only
once
a
hunt
came
near
when
two
that
had
lost
the
main
pack
strayed
on
to
his
land
and
he
shot
them
instantly
and
buried
them
afterwards
himself
it
was
not
long
now
to
the
end
of
the
season
as
it
was
the
middle
of
march
but
living
as
he
did
at
this
time
tebrick
grew
more
and
more
to
be
a
true
misanthrope
he
denied
admittance
to
any
that
came
to
visit
him
and
rarely
showed
himself
to
his
fellows
but
went
out
chiefly
in
the
early
mornings
before
people
were
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing
his
beloved
fox
indeed
it
was
only
this
hope
that
he
would
see
her
again
that
kept
him
alive
for
he
had
become
so
careless
of
his
own
comfort
in
every
way
that
he
very
seldom
ate
a
proper
meal
taking
no
more
than
a
crust
of
bread
with
a
morsel
of
cheese
in
the
whole
day
though
sometimes
he
would
drink
half
a
bottle
of
whiskey
to
drown
his
sorrow
and
to
get
off
to
sleep
for
sleep
fled
from
him
and
no
sooner
did
he
begin
dozing
but
he
awoke
with
a
start
thinking
he
had
heard
something
he
let
his
beard
grow
too
and
though
he
had
always
been
very
particular
in
his
person
before
he
now
was
utterly
careless
of
it
gave
up
washing
himself
for
a
week
or
two
at
a
stretch
and
if
there
was
dirt
under
his
finger
nails
let
it
stop
there
all
this
disorder
fed
a
malignant
pleasure
in
him
for
by
now
he
had
come
to
hate
his
fellow
men
and
was
embittered
against
all
human
decencies
and
decorum
for
strange
to
tell
he
never
once
in
these
months
regretted
his
dear
wife
whom
he
had
so
much
loved
no
all
that
he
grieved
for
now
was
his
departed
vixen
he
was
haunted
all
this
time
not
by
the
memory
of
a
sweet
and
gentle
woman
but
by
the
recollection
of
an
animal
a
beast
it
is
true
that
could
sit
at
table
and
play
piquet
when
it
would
but
for
all
that
nothing
really
but
a
wild
beast
his
one
hope
now
was
the
recovery
of
this
beast
and
of
this
he
dreamed
continually
likewise
both
waking
and
sleeping
he
was
visited
by
visions
of
her
her
mask
her
full
brush
white
throat
and
the
thick
fur
in
her
ears
all
haunted
him
every
one
of
her
foxey
ways
was
now
so
absolutely
precious
to
him
that
i
believe
that
if
he
had
known
for
certain
she
was
dead
and
had
thoughts
of
marrying
a
second
time
he
would
never
have
been
happy
with
a
woman
no
indeed
he
would
have
been
more
tempted
to
get
himself
a
tame
fox
and
would
have
counted
that
as
good
a
marriage
as
he
could
make
yet
this
all
proceeded
one
may
say
from
a
passion
and
a
true
conjugal
fidelity
that
it
would
be
hard
to
find
matched
in
this
world
and
though
we
may
think
him
a
fool
almost
a
madman
we
must
when
we
look
closer
find
much
to
respect
in
his
extraordinary
devotion
how
different
indeed
was
he
from
those
who
if
their
wives
go
mad
shut
them
in
madhouses
and
give
themselves
up
to
concubinage
and
nay
what
is
more
there
are
many
who
extenuate
such
conduct
too
but
tebrick
was
of
a
very
different
temper
and
though
his
wife
was
now
nothing
but
a
hunted
beast
cared
for
no
one
in
the
world
but
her
but
this
devouring
love
ate
into
him
like
a
consumption
so
that
by
sleepless
nights
and
not
caring
for
his
person
in
a
few
months
he
was
worn
to
the
shadow
of
himself
his
cheeks
were
sunk
in
his
eyes
hollow
but
excessively
brilliant
and
his
whole
body
had
lost
flesh
so
that
looking
at
him
the
wonder
was
that
he
was
still
alive
now
that
the
hunting
season
was
over
he
had
less
anxiety
for
her
yet
even
so
he
was
not
positive
that
the
hounds
had
not
got
her
for
between
the
time
of
his
setting
her
free
and
the
end
of
the
hunting
season
just
after
easter
there
were
but
three
vixens
killed
near
of
those
three
one
was
a
or
and
one
was
a
very
grey
beast
the
third
answered
more
to
the
description
of
his
wife
but
that
it
had
not
much
black
on
the
legs
whereas
in
her
the
blackness
of
the
legs
was
very
plain
to
be
noticed
but
yet
his
fear
made
him
think
that
perhaps
she
had
got
mired
in
running
and
the
legs
being
muddy
were
not
remarked
on
as
black
one
morning
the
first
week
in
may
about
four
when
he
was
out
waiting
in
the
little
copse
he
sat
down
for
a
while
on
a
tree
stump
and
when
he
looked
up
saw
a
fox
coming
towards
him
over
the
ploughed
field
it
was
carrying
a
hare
over
its
shoulder
so
that
it
was
nearly
all
hidden
from
him
at
last
when
it
was
not
twenty
yards
from
him
it
crossed
over
going
into
the
copse
when
tebrick
stood
up
and
cried
out
silvia
silvia
is
it
you
the
fox
dropped
the
hare
out
of
his
mouth
and
stood
looking
at
him
and
then
our
gentleman
saw
at
the
first
glance
that
this
was
not
his
wife
for
whereas
tebrick
had
been
of
a
very
bright
red
this
was
a
swarthier
duller
beast
altogether
moreover
it
was
a
good
deal
larger
and
higher
at
the
shoulder
and
had
a
great
white
tag
to
his
brush
but
the
fox
after
the
first
instant
did
not
stand
for
his
portrait
you
may
be
sure
but
picked
up
his
hare
and
made
off
like
an
arrow
then
tebrick
cried
out
to
himself
indeed
i
am
crazy
now
my
affliction
has
made
me
lose
what
little
reason
i
ever
had
here
am
i
taking
every
fox
i
see
to
be
my
wife
my
neighbours
call
me
a
madman
and
now
i
see
that
they
are
right
look
at
me
now
oh
god
how
foul
a
creature
i
am
i
hate
my
fellows
i
am
thin
and
wasted
by
this
consuming
passion
my
reason
is
gone
and
i
feed
myself
on
dreams
recall
me
to
my
duty
bring
me
back
to
decency
let
me
not
become
a
beast
likewise
but
restore
me
and
forgive
me
oh
my
lord
with
that
he
burst
into
scalding
tears
and
knelt
down
and
prayed
a
thing
he
had
not
done
for
many
weeks
when
he
rose
up
he
walked
back
feeling
giddy
and
exceedingly
weak
but
with
a
contrite
heart
and
then
washed
himself
thoroughly
and
changed
his
clothes
but
his
weakness
increasing
he
lay
down
for
the
rest
of
the
day
but
read
in
the
book
of
job
and
was
much
comforted
for
several
days
after
this
he
lived
very
soberly
for
his
weakness
continued
but
every
day
he
read
in
the
bible
and
prayed
earnestly
so
that
his
resolution
was
so
much
strengthened
that
he
determined
to
overcome
his
folly
or
his
passion
if
he
could
and
at
any
rate
to
live
the
rest
of
his
life
very
religiously
so
strong
was
this
desire
in
him
to
amend
his
ways
that
he
considered
if
he
should
not
go
to
spread
the
gospel
abroad
for
the
bible
society
and
so
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
indeed
he
began
a
letter
to
his
wife
uncle
the
canon
and
he
was
writing
this
when
he
was
startled
by
hearing
a
fox
bark
yet
so
great
was
this
new
turn
he
had
taken
that
he
did
not
rush
out
at
once
as
he
would
have
done
before
but
stayed
where
he
was
and
finished
his
letter
afterwards
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
only
a
wild
fox
and
sent
by
the
devil
to
mock
him
and
that
madness
lay
that
way
if
he
should
listen
but
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
deny
to
himself
that
it
might
have
been
his
wife
and
that
he
ought
to
welcome
the
prodigal
thus
he
was
torn
between
these
two
thoughts
neither
of
which
did
he
completely
believe
he
stayed
thus
tormented
with
doubts
and
fears
all
night
the
next
morning
he
woke
suddenly
with
a
start
and
on
the
instant
heard
a
fox
bark
once
more
at
that
he
pulled
on
his
clothes
and
ran
out
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
garden
gate
the
sun
was
not
yet
high
the
dew
thick
everywhere
and
for
a
minute
or
two
everything
was
very
silent
he
looked
about
him
eagerly
but
could
see
no
fox
yet
there
was
already
joy
in
his
heart
then
while
he
looked
up
and
down
the
road
he
saw
his
vixen
step
out
of
the
copse
about
thirty
yards
away
he
called
to
her
at
once
my
dearest
wife
oh
silvia
you
are
come
back
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
he
saw
her
wag
her
tail
which
set
his
last
doubts
at
rest
but
then
though
he
called
her
again
she
stepped
into
the
copse
once
more
though
she
looked
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
as
she
went
at
this
he
ran
after
her
but
softly
and
not
too
fast
lest
he
should
frighten
her
away
and
then
looked
about
for
her
again
and
called
to
her
when
he
saw
her
among
the
trees
still
keeping
her
distance
from
him
he
followed
her
then
and
as
he
approached
so
she
retreated
from
him
yet
always
looking
back
at
him
several
times
he
followed
after
her
through
the
underwood
up
the
side
of
the
hill
when
suddenly
she
disappeared
from
his
sight
behind
some
bracken
when
he
got
there
he
could
see
her
nowhere
but
looking
about
him
found
a
fox
earth
but
so
well
hidden
that
he
might
have
passed
it
by
a
thousand
times
and
would
never
have
found
it
unless
he
had
made
particular
search
at
that
spot
but
now
though
he
went
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
could
see
nothing
of
his
vixen
so
that
he
waited
a
little
while
wondering
presently
he
heard
a
noise
of
something
moving
in
the
earth
and
so
waited
silently
then
saw
something
which
pushed
itself
into
sight
it
was
a
small
sooty
black
beast
like
a
puppy
there
came
another
behind
it
then
another
and
so
on
till
there
were
five
of
them
lastly
there
came
his
vixen
pushing
her
litter
before
her
and
while
he
looked
at
her
silently
a
prey
to
his
confused
and
unhappy
emotions
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
shining
with
pride
and
happiness
she
picked
up
one
of
her
youngsters
then
in
her
mouth
and
brought
it
to
him
and
laid
it
in
front
of
him
and
then
looked
up
at
him
very
excited
or
so
it
seemed
tebrick
took
the
cub
in
his
hands
stroked
it
and
put
it
against
his
cheek
it
was
a
little
fellow
with
a
smutty
face
and
paws
with
staring
vacant
eyes
of
a
brilliant
electric
blue
and
a
little
tail
like
a
carrot
when
he
was
put
down
he
took
a
step
towards
his
mother
and
then
sat
down
very
comically
tebrick
looked
at
his
wife
again
and
spoke
to
her
calling
her
a
good
creature
already
he
was
resigned
and
now
indeed
for
the
first
time
he
thoroughly
understood
what
had
happened
to
her
and
how
far
apart
they
were
now
but
looking
first
at
one
cub
then
at
another
and
having
them
sprawling
over
his
lap
he
forgot
himself
only
watching
the
pretty
scene
and
taking
pleasure
in
it
now
and
then
he
would
stroke
his
vixen
and
kiss
her
liberties
which
she
freely
allowed
him
he
marvelled
more
than
ever
now
at
her
beauty
for
her
gentleness
with
the
cubs
and
the
extreme
delight
she
took
in
them
seemed
to
him
then
to
make
her
more
lovely
than
before
thus
lying
amongst
them
at
the
mouth
of
the
earth
he
idled
away
the
whole
of
the
morning
first
he
would
play
with
one
then
with
another
rolling
them
over
and
tickling
them
but
they
were
too
young
yet
to
lend
themselves
to
any
other
more
active
sport
than
this
every
now
and
then
he
would
stroke
his
vixen
or
look
at
her
and
thus
the
time
slipped
away
quite
fast
and
he
was
surprised
when
she
gathered
her
cubs
together
and
pushed
them
before
her
into
the
earth
then
coming
back
to
him
once
or
twice
very
humanly
bid
him
and
that
she
hoped
she
would
see
him
soon
again
now
he
had
found
out
the
way
so
admirably
did
she
express
her
meaning
that
it
would
have
been
superfluous
for
her
to
have
spoken
had
she
been
able
and
tebrick
who
was
used
to
her
got
up
at
once
and
went
home
but
now
that
he
was
alone
all
the
feelings
which
he
had
not
troubled
himself
with
when
he
was
with
her
but
had
as
it
were
put
aside
till
after
his
innocent
pleasures
were
over
all
these
came
swarming
back
to
assail
him
in
a
hundred
tormenting
ways
firstly
he
asked
himself
was
not
his
wife
unfaithful
to
him
had
she
not
prostituted
herself
to
a
beast
could
he
still
love
her
after
that
but
this
did
not
trouble
him
so
much
as
it
might
have
done
for
now
he
was
convinced
inwardly
that
she
could
no
longer
in
fairness
be
judged
as
a
woman
but
as
a
fox
only
and
as
a
fox
she
had
done
no
more
than
other
foxes
indeed
in
having
cubs
and
tending
them
with
love
she
had
done
well
whether
in
this
conclusion
tebrick
was
in
the
right
or
not
is
not
for
us
here
to
consider
but
i
would
only
say
to
those
who
would
censure
him
for
a
too
lenient
view
of
the
religious
side
of
the
matter
that
we
have
not
seen
the
thing
as
he
did
and
perhaps
if
it
were
displayed
before
our
eyes
we
might
be
led
to
the
same
conclusions
this
was
however
not
a
tenth
part
of
the
trouble
in
which
tebrick
found
himself
for
he
asked
himself
also
was
he
not
jealous
and
looking
into
his
heart
he
found
that
he
was
indeed
jealous
yes
and
angry
too
that
now
he
must
share
his
vixen
with
wild
foxes
then
he
questioned
himself
if
it
were
not
dishonourable
to
do
so
and
whether
he
should
not
utterly
forget
her
and
follow
his
original
intention
of
retiring
from
the
world
and
see
her
no
more
thus
he
tormented
himself
for
the
rest
of
that
day
and
by
evening
he
had
resolved
never
to
see
her
again
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
woke
up
with
his
head
very
clear
and
said
to
himself
in
wonder
am
i
not
a
madman
i
torment
myself
foolishly
with
fantastic
notions
can
a
man
have
his
honour
sullied
by
a
beast
i
am
a
man
i
am
immeasurably
superior
to
the
animals
can
my
dignity
allow
of
my
being
jealous
of
a
beast
a
thousand
times
no
were
i
to
lust
after
a
vixen
i
were
a
criminal
indeed
i
can
be
happy
in
seeing
my
vixen
for
i
love
her
but
she
does
right
to
be
happy
according
to
the
laws
of
her
being
lastly
he
said
to
himself
what
was
he
felt
the
truth
of
this
whole
matter
when
i
am
with
her
i
am
happy
but
now
i
distort
what
is
simple
and
drive
myself
crazy
with
false
reasoning
upon
it
yet
before
he
slept
again
he
prayed
but
though
he
had
thought
first
to
pray
for
guidance
in
reality
he
prayed
only
that
on
the
morrow
he
would
see
his
vixen
again
and
that
god
would
preserve
her
and
her
cubs
too
from
all
dangers
and
would
allow
him
to
see
them
often
so
that
he
might
come
to
love
them
for
her
sake
as
if
he
were
their
father
and
that
if
this
were
a
sin
he
might
be
forgiven
for
he
sinned
in
ignorance
the
next
day
or
two
he
saw
vixen
and
cubs
again
though
his
visits
were
cut
shorter
and
these
visits
gave
him
such
an
innocent
pleasure
that
very
soon
his
notions
of
honour
duty
and
so
on
were
entirely
forgotten
and
his
jealousy
lulled
asleep
one
day
he
tried
taking
with
him
the
stereoscope
and
a
pack
of
cards
but
though
his
silvia
was
affectionate
and
amiable
enough
to
let
him
put
the
stereoscope
over
her
muzzle
yet
she
would
not
look
through
it
but
kept
turning
her
head
to
lick
his
hand
and
it
was
plain
to
him
that
now
she
had
quite
forgotten
the
use
of
the
instrument
it
was
the
same
too
with
the
cards
for
with
them
she
was
pleased
enough
but
only
delighting
to
bite
at
them
and
flip
them
about
with
her
paws
and
never
considering
for
a
moment
whether
they
were
diamonds
or
clubs
or
hearts
or
spades
or
whether
the
card
was
an
ace
or
not
so
it
was
evident
that
she
had
forgotten
the
nature
of
cards
too
thereafter
he
only
brought
them
things
which
she
could
better
enjoy
that
is
sugar
grapes
raisins
and
butcher
meat
as
the
summer
wore
on
the
cubs
came
to
know
him
and
he
them
so
that
he
was
able
to
tell
them
easily
apart
and
then
he
christened
them
for
this
purpose
he
brought
a
little
bowl
of
water
sprinkled
them
as
if
in
baptism
and
told
them
he
was
their
godfather
and
gave
each
of
them
a
name
calling
them
sorel
kasper
selwyn
esther
and
angelica
sorel
was
a
clumsy
little
beast
of
a
cheery
and
indeed
puppyish
disposition
kasper
was
fierce
the
largest
of
the
five
even
in
his
play
he
would
always
bite
and
gave
his
godfather
many
a
sharp
nip
as
time
went
on
esther
was
of
a
dark
complexion
a
true
brunette
and
very
sturdy
angelica
the
brightest
red
and
the
most
exactly
like
her
mother
while
selwyn
was
the
smallest
cub
of
a
very
prying
inquisitive
and
cunning
temper
but
delicate
and
undersized
thus
tebrick
had
a
whole
family
now
to
occupy
him
and
indeed
came
to
love
them
with
very
much
of
a
father
love
and
partiality
his
favourite
was
angelica
who
reminded
him
so
much
of
her
mother
in
her
pretty
ways
because
of
a
gentleness
which
was
lacking
in
the
others
even
in
their
play
after
her
in
his
affections
came
selwyn
whom
he
soon
saw
was
the
most
intelligent
of
the
whole
litter
indeed
he
was
so
much
more
than
the
rest
that
tebrick
was
led
into
speculating
as
to
whether
he
had
not
inherited
something
of
the
human
from
his
dam
thus
very
early
he
learnt
to
know
his
name
and
would
come
when
he
was
called
and
what
was
stranger
still
he
learnt
the
names
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
before
they
came
to
do
so
themselves
besides
all
this
he
was
something
of
a
young
philosopher
for
though
his
brother
kasper
tyrannized
over
him
he
put
up
with
it
all
with
an
unruffled
temper
he
was
not
however
above
playing
tricks
on
the
others
and
one
day
when
tebrick
was
by
he
made
believe
that
there
was
a
mouse
in
a
hole
some
little
way
off
very
soon
he
was
joined
by
sorel
and
presently
by
kasper
and
esther
when
he
had
got
them
all
digging
it
was
easy
for
him
to
slip
away
and
then
he
came
to
his
godfather
with
a
sly
look
sat
down
before
him
and
smiled
and
then
jerked
his
head
over
towards
the
others
and
smiled
again
and
wrinkled
his
brows
so
that
tebrick
knew
as
well
as
if
he
had
spoken
that
the
youngster
was
saying
have
i
not
made
fools
of
them
all
he
was
the
only
one
that
was
curious
about
tebrick
he
made
him
take
out
his
watch
put
his
ear
to
it
considered
it
and
wrinkled
up
his
brows
in
perplexity
on
the
next
visit
it
was
the
same
thing
he
must
see
the
watch
again
and
again
think
over
it
but
clever
as
he
was
little
selwyn
could
never
understand
it
and
if
his
mother
remembered
anything
about
watches
it
was
a
subject
which
she
never
attempted
to
explain
to
her
children
one
day
tebrick
left
the
earth
as
usual
and
ran
down
the
slope
to
the
road
when
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
carriage
waiting
before
his
house
and
a
coachman
walking
about
near
his
gate
tebrick
went
in
and
found
that
his
visitor
was
waiting
for
him
it
was
his
wife
uncle
they
shook
hands
though
the
rev
canon
fox
did
not
recognise
him
immediately
and
tebrick
led
him
into
the
house
the
clergyman
looked
about
him
a
good
deal
at
the
dirty
and
disorderly
rooms
and
when
tebrick
took
him
into
the
drawing
room
it
was
evident
that
it
had
been
unused
for
several
months
the
dust
lay
so
thickly
on
all
the
furniture
after
some
conversation
on
indifferent
topics
canon
fox
said
to
him
i
have
called
really
to
ask
about
my
niece
tebrick
was
silent
for
some
time
and
then
said
she
is
quite
happy
now
ah
indeed
i
have
heard
she
is
not
living
with
you
any
longer
no
she
is
not
living
with
me
she
is
not
far
away
i
see
her
every
day
now
indeed
where
does
she
live
in
the
woods
with
her
children
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
she
has
changed
her
shape
she
is
a
fox
the
rev
canon
fox
got
up
he
was
alarmed
and
everything
tebrick
said
confirmed
what
he
had
been
led
to
expect
he
would
find
at
rylands
when
he
was
outside
however
he
asked
tebrick
you
do
have
many
visitors
now
eh
no
i
never
see
anyone
if
i
can
avoid
it
you
are
the
first
person
i
have
spoken
to
for
months
quite
right
too
my
dear
fellow
i
quite
understand
in
the
circumstances
then
the
cleric
shook
him
by
the
hand
got
into
his
carriage
and
drove
away
at
any
rate
he
said
to
himself
there
will
be
no
scandal
he
was
relieved
also
because
tebrick
had
said
nothing
about
going
abroad
to
disseminate
the
gospel
canon
fox
had
been
alarmed
by
the
letter
had
not
answered
it
and
thought
that
it
was
always
better
to
let
things
be
and
never
to
refer
to
anything
unpleasant
he
did
not
at
all
want
to
recommend
tebrick
to
the
bible
society
if
he
were
mad
his
eccentricities
would
never
be
noticed
at
stokoe
besides
that
tebrick
had
said
he
was
happy
he
was
sorry
for
tebrick
too
and
he
said
to
himself
that
the
queer
girl
his
niece
must
have
married
him
because
he
was
the
first
man
she
had
met
he
reflected
also
that
he
was
never
likely
to
see
her
again
and
said
aloud
when
he
had
driven
some
little
way
not
an
affectionate
disposition
then
to
his
coachman
no
that
all
right
drive
on
hopkins
when
tebrick
was
alone
he
rejoiced
exceedingly
in
his
solitary
life
he
understood
or
so
he
fancied
what
it
was
to
be
happy
and
that
he
had
found
complete
happiness
now
living
from
day
to
day
careless
of
the
future
surrounded
every
morning
by
playful
and
affectionate
little
creatures
whom
he
loved
tenderly
and
sitting
beside
their
mother
whose
simple
happiness
was
the
source
of
his
own
true
happiness
he
said
to
himself
is
to
be
found
in
bestowing
love
there
is
no
such
happiness
as
that
of
the
mother
for
her
babe
unless
i
have
attained
it
in
mine
for
my
vixen
and
her
children
with
these
feelings
he
waited
impatiently
for
the
hour
on
the
morrow
when
he
might
hasten
to
them
once
more
when
however
he
had
toiled
up
the
hillside
to
the
earth
taking
infinite
precaution
not
to
tread
down
the
bracken
or
make
a
beaten
path
which
might
lead
others
to
that
secret
spot
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
silvia
was
not
there
and
that
there
were
no
cubs
to
be
seen
either
he
called
to
them
but
it
was
in
vain
and
at
last
he
laid
himself
on
the
mossy
bank
beside
the
earth
and
waited
for
a
long
while
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
lay
very
still
with
closed
eyes
straining
his
ears
to
hear
every
rustle
among
the
leaves
or
any
sound
that
might
be
the
cubs
stirring
in
the
earth
at
last
he
must
have
dropped
asleep
for
he
woke
suddenly
with
all
his
senses
alert
and
opening
his
eyes
found
a
fox
within
six
feet
of
him
sitting
on
its
haunches
like
a
dog
and
watching
his
face
with
curiosity
tebrick
saw
instantly
that
it
was
not
silvia
when
he
moved
the
fox
got
up
and
shifted
his
eyes
but
still
stood
his
ground
and
tebrick
recognised
him
then
for
the
he
had
seen
once
before
carrying
a
hare
it
was
the
same
dark
beast
with
a
large
white
tag
to
his
brush
now
the
secret
was
out
and
tebrick
could
see
his
rival
before
him
here
was
the
real
father
of
his
godchildren
who
could
be
certain
of
their
taking
after
him
and
leading
over
again
his
wild
and
rakish
life
tebrick
stared
for
a
long
time
at
the
handsome
rogue
who
glanced
back
at
him
with
distrust
and
watchfulness
patent
in
his
face
but
not
without
defiance
too
and
it
seemed
to
tebrick
as
if
there
was
also
a
touch
of
cynical
humour
in
his
look
as
if
he
said
by
gad
we
two
have
been
strangely
brought
together
and
to
the
man
at
any
rate
it
seemed
strange
that
they
were
thus
linked
and
he
wondered
if
the
love
his
rival
there
bare
to
his
vixen
and
his
cubs
were
the
same
thing
in
kind
as
his
own
we
would
both
of
us
give
our
lives
for
theirs
he
said
to
himself
as
he
reasoned
upon
it
we
both
of
us
are
happy
chiefly
in
their
company
what
pride
this
fellow
must
feel
to
have
such
a
wife
and
such
children
taking
after
him
and
has
he
not
reason
for
his
pride
he
lives
in
a
world
where
he
is
beset
with
a
thousand
dangers
for
half
the
year
he
is
hunted
everywhere
dogs
pursue
him
men
lay
traps
for
him
or
menace
him
he
owes
nothing
to
another
but
he
did
not
speak
knowing
that
his
words
would
only
alarm
the
fox
then
in
a
few
minutes
he
saw
the
look
over
his
shoulder
and
then
he
trotted
off
as
lightly
as
a
gossamer
veil
blown
in
the
wind
and
in
a
minute
or
two
more
back
he
comes
with
his
vixen
and
the
cubs
all
around
him
seeing
the
thus
surrounded
by
vixen
and
cubs
was
too
much
for
tebrick
in
spite
of
all
his
philosophy
a
pang
of
jealousy
shot
through
him
he
could
see
that
silvia
had
been
hunting
with
her
cubs
and
also
that
she
had
forgotten
that
he
would
come
that
morning
for
she
started
when
she
saw
him
and
though
she
carelessly
licked
his
hand
he
could
see
that
her
thoughts
were
not
with
him
very
soon
she
led
her
cubs
into
the
earth
the
had
vanished
and
tebrick
was
again
alone
he
did
not
wait
longer
but
went
home
now
was
his
peace
of
mind
all
gone
the
happiness
which
he
had
flattered
himself
the
night
before
he
knew
so
well
how
to
enjoy
seemed
now
but
a
fool
paradise
in
which
he
had
been
living
a
hundred
times
this
poor
gentleman
bit
his
lip
drew
down
his
torvous
brows
and
stamped
his
foot
and
cursed
himself
bitterly
or
called
his
lady
bitch
he
could
not
forgive
himself
neither
that
he
had
not
thought
of
the
damned
before
but
all
the
while
had
let
the
cubs
frisk
round
him
each
one
a
proof
that
a
had
been
at
work
with
his
vixen
yes
jealousy
was
now
in
the
wind
and
every
circumstance
which
had
been
a
reason
for
his
felicity
the
night
before
was
now
turned
into
a
monstrous
feature
of
his
nightmare
with
all
this
tebrick
so
worked
upon
himself
that
for
the
time
being
he
had
lost
his
reason
black
was
white
and
white
black
and
he
was
resolved
that
on
the
morrow
he
would
dig
the
vile
brood
of
foxes
out
and
shoot
them
and
so
free
himself
at
last
from
this
hellish
plague
all
that
night
he
was
in
this
mood
and
in
agony
as
if
he
had
broken
in
the
crown
of
a
tooth
and
bitten
on
the
nerve
but
as
all
things
will
have
an
ending
so
at
last
tebrick
worn
out
and
wearied
by
this
loathed
passion
of
jealousy
fell
into
an
uneasy
and
tormented
sleep
after
an
hour
or
two
the
procession
of
confused
and
jumbled
images
which
first
assailed
him
passed
away
and
subsided
into
one
clear
and
powerful
dream
his
wife
was
with
him
in
her
own
proper
shape
walking
as
they
had
been
on
that
fatal
day
before
her
transformation
yet
she
was
changed
too
for
in
her
face
there
were
visible
tokens
of
unhappiness
her
face
swollen
with
crying
pale
and
downcast
her
hair
hanging
in
disorder
her
damp
hands
wringing
a
small
handkerchief
into
a
ball
her
whole
body
shaken
with
sobs
and
an
air
of
long
neglect
about
her
person
between
her
sobs
she
was
confessing
to
him
some
crime
which
she
had
committed
but
he
did
not
catch
the
broken
words
nor
did
he
wish
to
hear
them
for
he
was
dulled
by
his
sorrow
so
they
continued
walking
together
in
sadness
as
it
were
for
ever
he
with
his
arm
about
her
waist
she
turning
her
head
to
him
and
often
casting
her
eyes
down
in
distress
at
last
they
sat
down
and
he
spoke
saying
i
know
they
are
not
my
children
but
i
shall
not
use
them
barbarously
because
of
that
you
are
still
my
wife
i
swear
to
you
they
shall
never
be
neglected
i
will
pay
for
their
education
then
he
began
turning
over
the
names
of
schools
in
his
mind
eton
would
not
do
nor
harrow
nor
winchester
nor
rugby
but
he
could
not
tell
why
these
schools
would
not
do
for
these
children
of
hers
he
only
knew
that
every
school
he
thought
of
was
impossible
but
surely
one
could
be
found
so
turning
over
the
names
of
schools
he
sat
for
a
long
while
holding
his
dear
wife
hand
till
at
length
still
weeping
she
got
up
and
went
away
and
then
slowly
he
awoke
but
even
when
he
had
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
about
him
he
was
thinking
of
schools
saying
to
himself
that
he
must
send
them
to
a
private
academy
or
even
at
the
worst
engage
a
tutor
why
yes
he
said
to
himself
putting
one
foot
out
of
bed
that
is
what
it
must
be
a
tutor
though
even
then
there
will
be
a
difficulty
at
first
at
those
words
he
wondered
what
difficulty
there
would
be
and
recollected
that
they
were
not
ordinary
children
no
they
were
foxes
mere
foxes
when
poor
tebrick
had
remembered
this
he
was
as
it
were
dazed
or
stunned
by
the
fact
and
for
a
long
time
he
could
understand
nothing
but
at
last
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
compassionating
them
and
himself
too
the
awfulness
of
the
fact
itself
that
his
dear
wife
should
have
foxes
instead
of
children
filled
him
with
an
agony
of
pity
and
at
length
when
he
recollected
the
cause
of
their
being
foxes
that
is
that
his
wife
was
a
fox
also
his
tears
broke
out
anew
and
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
but
began
calling
out
in
his
anguish
and
beat
his
head
once
or
twice
against
the
wall
and
then
cast
himself
down
on
his
bed
again
and
wept
and
wept
sometimes
tearing
the
sheets
asunder
with
his
teeth
the
whole
of
that
day
for
he
was
not
to
go
to
the
earth
till
evening
he
went
about
sorrowfully
torn
by
true
pity
for
his
poor
vixen
and
her
children
at
last
when
the
time
came
he
went
again
up
to
the
earth
which
he
found
deserted
but
hearing
his
voice
out
came
esther
but
though
he
called
the
others
by
their
names
there
was
no
answer
and
something
in
the
way
the
cub
greeted
him
made
him
fancy
she
was
indeed
alone
she
was
truly
rejoiced
to
see
him
and
scrambled
up
into
his
arms
and
thence
to
his
shoulder
kissing
him
which
was
unusual
in
her
though
natural
enough
in
her
sister
angelica
he
sat
down
a
little
way
from
the
earth
fondling
her
and
fed
her
with
some
fish
he
had
brought
for
her
mother
which
she
ate
so
ravenously
that
he
concluded
she
must
have
been
short
of
food
that
day
and
probably
alone
for
some
time
at
last
while
he
was
sitting
there
esther
pricked
up
her
ears
started
up
and
presently
tebrick
saw
his
vixen
come
towards
them
she
greeted
him
very
affectionately
but
it
was
plain
had
not
much
time
to
spare
for
she
soon
started
back
whence
she
had
come
with
esther
at
her
side
when
they
had
gone
about
a
rod
the
cub
hung
back
and
kept
stopping
and
looking
back
to
the
earth
and
at
last
turned
and
ran
back
home
but
her
mother
was
not
to
be
fobbed
off
so
for
she
quickly
overtook
her
child
and
gripping
her
by
the
scruff
began
to
drag
her
along
with
her
tebrick
seeing
then
how
matters
stood
spoke
to
her
telling
her
he
would
carry
esther
if
she
would
lead
so
after
a
little
while
silvia
gave
her
over
and
then
they
set
out
on
their
strange
journey
silvia
went
running
on
a
little
before
while
tebrick
followed
after
with
esther
in
his
arms
whimpering
and
struggling
now
to
be
free
and
indeed
once
she
gave
him
a
nip
with
her
teeth
this
was
not
so
strange
a
thing
to
him
now
and
he
knew
the
remedy
for
it
which
is
much
the
same
as
with
others
whose
tempers
run
too
high
that
is
a
taste
of
it
themselves
tebrick
shook
her
and
gave
her
a
smart
little
cuff
after
which
though
she
sulked
she
stopped
her
biting
they
went
thus
above
a
mile
circling
his
house
and
crossing
the
highway
until
they
gained
a
small
covert
that
lay
with
some
waste
fields
adjacent
to
it
and
by
this
time
it
was
so
dark
that
it
was
all
tebrick
could
do
to
pick
his
way
for
it
was
not
always
easy
for
him
to
follow
where
his
vixen
found
a
big
enough
road
for
herself
but
at
length
they
came
to
another
earth
and
by
the
starlight
tebrick
could
just
make
out
the
other
cubs
skylarking
in
the
shadows
now
he
was
tired
but
he
was
happy
and
laughed
softly
for
joy
and
presently
his
vixen
coming
to
him
put
her
feet
upon
his
shoulders
as
he
sat
on
the
ground
and
licked
him
and
he
kissed
her
back
on
the
muzzle
and
gathered
her
in
his
arms
and
rolled
her
in
his
jacket
and
then
laughed
and
wept
by
turns
in
the
excess
of
his
joy
all
his
jealousies
of
the
night
before
were
forgotten
now
all
his
desperate
sorrow
of
the
morning
and
the
horror
of
his
dream
were
gone
what
if
they
were
foxes
tebrick
found
that
he
could
be
happy
with
them
as
the
weather
was
hot
he
lay
out
there
all
the
night
first
playing
hide
and
seek
with
them
in
the
dark
till
missing
his
vixen
and
the
cubs
proving
obstreperous
he
lay
down
and
was
soon
asleep
he
was
woken
up
soon
after
dawn
by
one
of
the
cubs
tugging
at
his
shoelaces
in
play
when
he
sat
up
he
saw
two
of
the
cubs
standing
near
him
on
their
hind
legs
wrestling
with
each
other
the
other
two
were
playing
hide
and
seek
round
a
tree
trunk
and
now
angelica
let
go
his
laces
and
came
romping
into
his
arms
to
kiss
him
and
say
good
morning
to
him
then
worrying
the
points
of
his
waistcoat
a
little
shyly
after
the
warmth
of
his
embrace
that
moment
of
awakening
was
very
sweet
to
him
the
freshness
of
the
morning
the
scent
of
everything
at
the
day
rebirth
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
upon
a
near
and
a
pigeon
rising
into
the
air
suddenly
all
delighted
him
even
the
rough
scent
of
the
body
of
the
cub
in
his
arms
seemed
to
him
delicious
at
that
moment
all
human
customs
and
institutions
seemed
to
him
nothing
but
folly
for
said
he
i
would
exchange
all
my
life
as
a
man
for
my
happiness
now
and
even
now
i
retain
almost
all
of
the
ridiculous
conceptions
of
a
man
the
beasts
are
happier
and
i
will
deserve
that
happiness
as
best
i
can
after
he
had
looked
at
the
cubs
playing
merrily
how
with
soft
stealth
one
would
creep
behind
another
to
bounce
out
and
startle
him
a
thought
came
into
tebrick
head
and
that
was
that
these
cubs
were
innocent
they
were
as
stainless
snow
they
could
not
sin
for
god
had
created
them
to
be
thus
and
they
could
break
none
of
his
commandments
and
he
fancied
also
that
men
sin
because
they
can
not
be
as
the
animals
presently
he
got
up
full
of
happiness
and
began
making
his
way
home
when
suddenly
he
came
to
a
full
stop
and
asked
himself
what
is
going
to
happen
to
them
this
question
rooted
him
stockishly
in
a
cold
and
deadly
fear
as
if
he
had
seen
a
snake
before
him
at
last
he
shook
his
head
and
hurried
on
his
path
aye
indeed
what
would
become
of
his
vixen
and
her
children
this
thought
put
him
into
such
a
fever
of
apprehension
that
he
did
his
best
not
to
think
of
it
any
more
but
yet
it
stayed
with
him
all
that
day
and
for
weeks
after
at
the
back
of
his
mind
so
that
he
was
not
careless
in
his
happiness
as
before
but
as
it
were
trying
continually
to
escape
his
own
thoughts
this
made
him
also
anxious
to
pass
all
the
time
he
could
with
his
dear
silvia
and
therefore
he
began
going
out
to
them
for
more
of
the
daytime
and
then
he
would
sleep
the
night
in
the
woods
also
as
he
had
done
that
night
and
so
he
passed
several
weeks
only
returning
to
his
house
occasionally
to
get
himself
a
fresh
provision
of
food
but
after
a
week
or
ten
days
at
the
new
earth
both
his
vixen
and
the
cubs
too
got
a
new
habit
of
roaming
for
a
long
while
back
as
he
knew
his
vixen
had
been
lying
out
alone
most
of
the
day
and
now
the
cubs
were
all
for
doing
the
same
thing
the
earth
in
short
had
served
its
purpose
and
was
now
distasteful
to
them
and
they
would
not
enter
it
unless
pressed
with
fear
this
new
manner
of
their
lives
was
an
added
grief
to
tebrick
for
sometimes
he
missed
them
for
hours
together
or
for
the
whole
day
even
and
not
knowing
where
they
might
be
was
lonely
and
anxious
yet
his
silvia
was
thoughtful
for
him
too
and
would
often
send
angelica
or
another
of
the
cubs
to
fetch
him
to
their
new
lair
or
come
herself
if
she
could
spare
the
time
for
now
they
were
all
perfectly
accustomed
to
his
presence
and
had
come
to
look
on
him
as
their
natural
companion
and
although
he
was
in
many
ways
irksome
to
them
by
scaring
rabbits
yet
they
always
rejoiced
to
see
him
when
they
had
been
parted
from
him
this
friendliness
of
theirs
was
you
may
be
sure
the
source
of
most
of
tebrick
happiness
at
this
time
indeed
he
lived
now
for
nothing
but
his
foxes
his
love
for
his
vixen
had
extended
itself
insensibly
to
include
her
cubs
and
these
were
now
his
daily
playmates
so
that
he
knew
them
as
well
as
if
they
had
been
his
own
children
with
selwyn
and
angelica
indeed
he
was
always
happy
and
they
never
so
much
as
when
they
were
with
him
he
was
not
stiff
in
his
behaviour
either
but
had
learnt
by
this
time
as
much
from
his
foxes
as
they
had
from
him
indeed
never
was
there
a
more
curious
alliance
than
this
or
one
with
stranger
effects
upon
both
of
the
parties
tebrick
now
could
follow
after
them
anywhere
and
keep
up
with
them
too
and
could
go
through
a
wood
as
silently
as
a
deer
he
learnt
to
conceal
himself
if
ever
a
labourer
passed
by
so
that
he
was
rarely
seen
and
never
but
once
in
their
company
but
what
was
most
strange
of
all
he
had
got
a
way
of
going
doubled
up
often
almost
on
all
fours
with
his
hands
touching
the
ground
every
now
and
then
particularly
when
he
went
uphill
he
hunted
with
them
too
sometimes
chiefly
by
coming
up
and
scaring
rabbits
towards
where
the
cubs
lay
ambushed
so
that
the
bunnies
ran
straight
into
their
jaws
he
was
useful
to
them
in
other
ways
climbing
up
and
robbing
nests
for
the
eggs
which
they
relished
exceedingly
or
by
occasionally
dispatching
a
hedgehog
for
them
so
they
did
not
get
the
prickles
in
their
mouths
but
while
on
his
part
he
thus
altered
his
conduct
they
on
their
side
were
not
behindhand
but
learnt
a
dozen
human
tricks
from
him
that
are
ordinarily
wanting
in
reynard
education
one
evening
he
went
to
a
cottager
who
had
a
row
of
skeps
and
bought
one
of
them
just
as
it
was
after
the
man
had
smothered
the
bees
this
he
carried
to
the
foxes
that
they
might
taste
the
honey
for
he
had
seen
them
dig
out
wild
bees
nests
often
enough
the
skep
full
was
indeed
a
wonderful
feast
for
them
they
bit
greedily
into
the
heavy
scented
comb
their
jaws
were
drowned
in
the
sticky
flood
of
sweetness
and
they
gorged
themselves
on
it
without
restraint
when
they
had
crunched
up
the
last
morsel
they
tore
the
skep
in
pieces
and
for
hours
afterwards
they
were
happily
employed
in
licking
themselves
clean
that
night
he
slept
near
their
lair
but
they
left
him
and
went
hunting
in
the
morning
when
he
woke
he
was
quite
numb
with
cold
and
faint
with
hunger
a
white
mist
hung
over
everything
and
the
wood
smelt
of
autumn
he
got
up
and
stretched
his
cramped
limbs
and
then
walked
homewards
the
summer
was
over
and
tebrick
noticed
this
now
for
the
first
time
and
was
astonished
he
reflected
that
the
cubs
were
fast
growing
up
they
were
foxes
at
all
points
and
yet
when
he
thought
of
the
time
when
they
had
been
sooty
and
had
blue
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
only
yesterday
from
that
he
passed
to
thinking
of
the
future
asking
himself
as
he
had
done
once
before
what
would
become
of
his
vixen
and
her
children
before
the
winter
he
must
tempt
them
into
the
security
of
his
garden
and
fortify
it
against
all
the
dangers
that
threatened
them
but
though
he
tried
to
allay
his
fear
with
such
resolutions
he
remained
uneasy
all
that
day
when
he
went
out
to
them
that
afternoon
he
found
only
his
wife
silvia
there
and
it
was
plain
to
him
that
she
too
was
alarmed
but
alas
poor
creature
she
could
tell
him
nothing
only
lick
his
hands
and
face
and
turn
about
pricking
her
ears
at
every
sound
where
are
your
children
silvia
he
asked
her
several
times
but
she
was
impatient
of
his
questions
but
at
last
sprang
into
his
arms
flattened
herself
upon
his
breast
and
kissed
him
gently
so
that
when
he
departed
his
heart
was
lighter
because
he
knew
that
she
still
loved
him
that
night
he
slept
indoors
but
in
the
morning
early
he
was
awoken
by
the
sound
of
trotting
horses
and
running
to
the
window
saw
a
farmer
riding
by
very
sprucely
dressed
could
they
be
hunting
so
soon
he
wondered
but
presently
reassured
himself
that
it
could
not
be
a
hunt
already
he
heard
no
other
sound
till
eleven
in
the
morning
when
suddenly
there
was
the
clamour
of
hounds
giving
tongue
and
not
so
far
off
neither
at
this
tebrick
ran
out
of
his
house
distracted
and
set
open
the
gates
of
his
garden
but
with
iron
bars
and
wire
at
the
top
so
the
huntsmen
could
not
follow
there
was
silence
again
it
seems
the
fox
must
have
turned
away
for
there
was
no
other
sound
of
the
hunt
tebrick
was
now
like
one
helpless
with
fear
he
dared
not
go
out
yet
could
not
stay
still
at
home
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
do
yet
he
would
not
admit
this
so
he
busied
himself
in
making
holes
in
the
hedges
so
that
silvia
or
her
cubs
could
enter
from
whatever
side
she
came
at
last
he
forced
himself
to
go
indoors
and
sit
down
and
drink
some
tea
while
he
was
there
he
fancied
he
heard
the
hounds
again
it
was
but
a
faint
ghostly
echo
of
their
music
yet
when
he
ran
out
of
the
house
it
was
already
close
at
hand
in
the
copse
above
now
it
was
that
poor
tebrick
made
his
great
mistake
for
hearing
the
hounds
almost
outside
the
gate
he
ran
to
meet
them
whereas
rightly
he
should
have
run
back
to
the
house
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
gate
he
saw
his
wife
silvia
coming
towards
him
but
very
tired
with
running
and
just
upon
her
the
hounds
the
horror
of
that
sight
pierced
him
for
ever
afterwards
he
was
haunted
by
those
hounds
their
eagerness
their
desperate
efforts
to
gain
on
her
and
their
blind
lust
for
her
came
at
odd
moments
to
frighten
him
all
his
life
now
he
should
have
run
back
though
it
was
already
late
but
instead
he
cried
out
to
her
and
she
ran
straight
through
the
open
gate
to
him
what
followed
was
all
over
in
a
flash
but
it
was
seen
by
many
witnesses
the
side
of
tebrick
garden
there
is
bounded
by
a
wall
about
six
feet
high
and
curving
round
so
that
the
huntsmen
could
see
over
this
wall
inside
one
of
them
indeed
put
his
horse
at
it
very
boldly
which
was
risking
his
neck
and
although
he
got
over
safe
was
too
late
to
be
of
much
assistance
his
vixen
had
at
once
sprung
into
tebrick
arms
and
before
he
could
turn
back
the
hounds
were
upon
them
and
had
pulled
them
down
then
at
that
moment
there
was
a
scream
of
despair
heard
by
all
the
field
that
had
come
up
which
they
declared
afterwards
was
more
like
a
voice
than
a
man
but
yet
there
was
no
clear
proof
whether
it
was
tebrick
or
his
wife
who
had
suddenly
regained
her
voice
when
the
huntsman
who
had
leapt
the
wall
got
to
them
and
had
whipped
off
the
hounds
tebrick
had
been
terribly
mauled
and
was
bleeding
from
twenty
wounds
as
for
his
vixen
she
was
dead
though
he
was
still
clasping
her
dead
body
in
his
arms
tebrick
was
carried
into
the
house
at
once
and
assistance
sent
for
but
there
was
no
doubt
now
about
his
neighbours
being
in
the
right
when
they
called
him
mad
for
a
long
while
his
life
was
despaired
of
but
at
last
he
rallied
and
in
the
end
he
recovered
his
reason
and
lived
to
be
a
great
age
for
that
matter
he
is
still
alive
