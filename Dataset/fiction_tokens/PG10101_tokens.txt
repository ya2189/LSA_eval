chapter
i
the
home
on
the
great
plain
some
like
to
be
one
thing
some
another
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
so
many
different
things
to
do
so
many
trades
shepherds
soldiers
sailors
ploughmen
carters
one
could
go
on
all
day
naming
without
getting
to
the
end
of
them
for
myself
boy
and
man
i
have
been
many
things
working
for
a
living
and
sometimes
doing
things
just
for
pleasure
but
somehow
whatever
i
did
it
never
seemed
quite
the
right
and
proper
thing
to
do
it
never
quite
satisfied
me
i
always
wanted
to
do
something
else
i
wanted
to
be
a
carpenter
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
stand
among
and
sawdust
making
things
at
a
bench
with
bright
beautiful
tools
out
of
wood
was
the
cleanest
healthiest
prettiest
work
that
any
man
can
do
now
all
this
has
nothing
or
very
little
to
do
with
my
story
i
only
spoke
of
it
because
i
had
to
begin
somehow
and
it
struck
me
that
i
would
make
a
start
that
way
and
for
another
reason
too
father
was
a
i
mean
martin
father
martin
the
little
boy
lost
his
father
name
was
john
and
he
was
a
very
good
man
and
a
good
carpenter
and
he
loved
to
do
his
carpentering
better
than
anything
else
in
fact
as
much
as
i
should
have
loved
it
if
i
had
been
taught
that
trade
he
lived
in
a
seaside
town
named
southampton
where
there
is
a
great
harbour
where
he
saw
great
ships
coming
and
going
to
and
from
all
parts
of
the
world
now
no
strong
brave
man
can
live
in
a
place
like
that
seeing
the
ships
and
often
talking
to
the
people
who
voyaged
in
them
about
the
distant
lands
where
they
had
been
without
wishing
to
go
and
see
those
distant
countries
for
himself
when
it
is
winter
in
england
and
it
rains
and
rains
and
the
east
wind
blows
and
it
is
grey
and
cold
and
the
trees
are
bare
who
does
not
think
how
nice
it
would
be
to
fly
away
like
the
summer
birds
to
some
distant
country
where
the
sky
is
always
blue
and
the
sun
shines
bright
and
warm
every
day
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
john
at
last
when
he
was
an
old
man
sold
his
shop
and
went
abroad
they
went
to
a
country
many
thousands
of
miles
away
for
you
must
know
that
john
went
too
and
when
the
sea
voyage
ended
they
travelled
many
days
and
weeks
in
a
wagon
until
they
came
to
the
place
where
they
wanted
to
live
and
there
in
that
lonely
country
they
built
a
house
and
made
a
garden
and
planted
an
orchard
it
was
a
desert
and
they
had
no
neighbours
but
they
were
happy
enough
because
they
had
as
much
land
as
they
wanted
and
the
weather
was
always
bright
and
beautiful
john
too
had
his
carpenter
tools
to
work
with
when
he
felt
inclined
and
best
of
all
they
had
little
martin
to
love
and
think
about
but
how
about
martin
himself
you
might
think
that
with
no
other
child
to
prattle
to
and
play
with
or
even
to
see
it
was
too
lonely
a
home
for
him
not
a
bit
of
it
no
child
could
have
been
happier
he
did
not
want
for
company
his
playfellows
were
the
dogs
and
cats
and
chickens
and
any
creature
in
and
about
the
house
but
most
of
all
he
loved
the
little
shy
creatures
that
lived
in
the
sunshine
among
the
flowers
the
small
birds
and
butterflies
and
little
beasties
and
creeping
things
he
was
accustomed
to
see
outside
the
gate
among
the
tall
wild
sunflowers
there
were
acres
of
these
plants
and
they
were
taller
than
martin
and
covered
with
flowers
no
bigger
than
marigolds
and
here
among
the
sunflowers
he
used
to
spend
most
of
the
day
as
happy
as
possible
he
had
other
amusements
too
whenever
john
went
to
his
shop
for
the
old
man
still
dearly
loved
his
carpentering
martin
would
run
in
to
keep
him
company
one
thing
he
liked
to
do
was
to
pick
up
the
longest
to
wind
them
round
his
neck
and
arms
and
legs
and
then
he
would
laugh
and
dance
with
delight
happy
as
a
young
indian
in
his
ornaments
a
may
seem
a
poor
plaything
to
a
child
with
all
the
toyshops
in
london
to
pick
and
choose
from
but
it
is
really
very
curious
and
pretty
bright
and
smooth
to
the
touch
pencilled
with
delicate
wavy
lines
while
in
its
spiral
shape
it
reminds
one
of
winding
plants
and
tendrils
by
means
of
which
vines
and
creepers
support
themselves
and
flowers
with
curling
petals
and
curled
leaves
and
and
many
other
pretty
natural
objects
one
day
martin
ran
into
the
house
looking
very
flushed
and
joyous
holding
up
his
pinafore
with
something
heavy
in
it
what
have
you
got
now
cried
his
father
and
mother
in
a
breath
getting
up
to
peep
at
his
treasure
for
martin
was
always
fetching
in
the
most
curious
things
to
show
them
my
pretty
shaving
said
martin
proudly
illustration
when
they
looked
they
were
amazed
and
horrified
to
see
a
spotted
green
snake
coiled
comfortably
up
in
the
pinafore
it
did
appear
to
like
being
looked
at
by
them
for
it
raised
its
curious
head
and
flicked
its
little
red
forked
tongue
at
them
his
mother
gave
a
great
scream
and
dropped
the
jug
she
had
in
her
hand
upon
the
floor
while
john
rushed
off
to
get
a
big
stick
drop
it
martin
drop
the
wicked
snake
before
it
stings
you
and
i
soon
kill
it
martin
stared
surprised
at
the
fuss
they
were
making
then
still
tightly
holding
the
ends
of
his
pinafore
he
turned
and
ran
out
of
the
room
and
away
as
fast
as
he
could
go
away
went
his
father
after
him
stick
in
hand
and
out
of
the
gate
into
the
thicket
of
tall
wild
sunflowers
where
martin
had
vanished
from
sight
after
hunting
about
for
some
time
he
found
the
little
sitting
on
the
ground
among
the
weeds
where
the
snake
he
cried
gone
said
martin
waving
his
little
hand
around
i
let
it
go
and
you
must
look
for
it
john
picked
the
child
up
in
his
arms
and
marched
back
to
the
room
and
popped
him
down
on
the
floor
then
gave
him
a
good
scolding
it
a
mercy
the
poisonous
thing
did
sting
you
he
said
you
a
naughty
little
boy
to
play
with
snakes
because
dangerous
bad
things
and
you
die
if
they
bite
you
and
now
you
must
go
straight
to
bed
that
the
only
punishment
that
has
any
effect
on
such
a
harebrained
little
butterfly
martin
puckering
up
his
face
for
a
cry
crept
away
to
his
little
room
it
was
very
hard
to
have
to
go
to
bed
in
the
daytime
when
he
was
not
sleepy
and
when
the
birds
and
butterflies
were
out
in
the
sunshine
having
such
a
good
time
it
not
a
bit
of
use
scolding
him
i
found
that
out
long
ago
said
john
shaking
her
head
do
you
know
john
i
ca
help
thinking
sometimes
that
he
not
our
child
at
all
whose
child
do
you
think
he
is
then
said
john
who
had
a
cup
of
water
in
his
hand
for
the
chase
after
martin
had
made
him
hot
and
he
wanted
cooling
i
do
know
but
i
once
had
a
very
curious
dream
people
often
do
have
curious
dreams
said
wise
old
john
but
this
was
a
very
curious
one
and
i
remember
saying
to
myself
if
this
does
mean
something
that
is
going
to
happen
then
dreams
do
count
for
much
no
more
they
do
said
john
it
was
in
england
just
when
we
were
getting
ready
for
the
voyage
and
it
was
autumn
when
the
birds
were
leaving
us
i
dreamed
that
i
went
out
alone
and
walked
by
the
sea
and
stood
watching
a
great
number
of
swallows
flying
by
and
out
over
the
sea
flying
away
to
some
distant
land
i
noticed
one
bird
coming
down
lower
and
lower
as
if
he
wanted
to
alight
and
i
watched
it
and
it
came
down
straight
to
me
and
at
last
flew
right
into
my
bosom
i
put
my
hand
on
it
and
looking
close
saw
that
it
was
a
martin
all
pure
white
on
its
throat
and
breast
and
with
a
white
patch
on
its
back
then
i
woke
up
and
it
was
because
of
that
dream
that
i
named
our
child
martin
instead
of
john
as
you
wished
to
do
now
when
i
watch
swallows
flying
about
coming
and
going
round
the
house
i
sometimes
think
that
martin
came
to
us
like
that
one
in
the
dream
and
that
some
day
he
will
fly
away
from
us
when
he
gets
bigger
i
mean
when
he
gets
littler
you
mean
said
john
with
a
laugh
no
no
he
too
big
for
a
swallow
a
michaelmas
goose
would
be
nothing
to
him
for
size
but
here
i
am
listening
to
your
silly
dreams
instead
of
watering
the
melons
and
cucumbers
and
out
he
went
to
his
garden
but
in
a
minute
he
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
you
may
go
and
tell
him
to
get
up
if
you
like
poor
little
fellow
only
make
him
promise
not
to
go
chumming
with
spotted
snakes
any
more
and
not
to
bring
them
into
the
house
because
somehow
they
disagree
with
me
illustration
chapter
ii
the
spoonbill
and
the
cloud
as
martin
grew
in
years
and
strength
his
age
being
now
about
seven
his
rambles
began
to
extend
beyond
the
waste
grounds
outside
of
the
fenced
orchard
and
gate
these
waste
grounds
were
a
wilderness
of
weeds
here
were
the
sunflowers
that
martin
liked
best
the
wild
flaunting
great
crimson
tufts
the
yellow
flowering
mustard
taller
than
the
tallest
man
giant
thistle
and
wild
pumpkin
with
spotted
leaves
the
huge
hairy
with
yellow
bells
feathery
fennel
and
the
big
with
prickly
burs
full
of
bright
red
seed
and
long
white
flowers
that
bloomed
only
in
the
evening
he
could
never
get
high
enough
on
anything
to
see
over
the
tops
of
these
plants
but
at
last
he
found
his
way
through
them
and
discovered
on
their
further
side
a
wide
grassy
plain
with
scarcely
a
tree
on
it
stretching
away
into
the
blue
distance
on
this
vast
plain
he
gazed
with
wonderment
and
delight
behind
the
orchard
and
weedy
waste
the
ground
sloped
down
to
a
stream
of
running
water
full
of
tall
rushes
with
dark
green
polished
stems
and
yellow
all
along
the
moist
banks
grew
other
flowers
that
were
never
seen
in
the
dry
ground
above
the
blue
star
and
scarlet
and
white
verbenas
and
of
all
colours
and
the
delicate
red
vinegar
flower
and
angel
hair
and
the
small
fragrant
lilies
called
and
tall
scattered
flags
flaunting
their
yellow
blossoms
high
above
the
meadow
grass
every
day
martin
ran
down
to
the
stream
to
gather
flowers
and
shells
for
many
curious
were
found
there
with
brown
shells
and
he
also
liked
to
watch
the
small
birds
that
build
their
nests
in
the
rushes
there
were
three
of
these
small
birds
that
did
not
appear
to
know
that
martin
loved
them
for
no
sooner
would
he
present
himself
at
the
stream
than
forth
they
would
flutter
in
a
great
state
of
mind
one
the
prettiest
was
a
tiny
little
creature
with
a
crimson
crest
and
a
band
across
a
bright
yellow
breast
this
one
had
a
soft
low
complaining
voice
clear
as
a
silver
bell
the
second
was
a
brisk
little
grey
and
black
fellow
with
a
loud
indignant
chuck
and
a
broad
tail
which
he
incessantly
opened
and
shut
like
a
spanish
lady
playing
with
her
fan
the
third
was
a
shy
mysterious
little
brown
bird
peering
out
of
the
clustering
leaves
and
making
a
sound
like
the
soft
ticking
of
a
clock
they
were
like
three
little
men
an
italian
a
dutchman
and
a
hindoo
talking
together
each
in
his
own
language
and
yet
well
able
to
understand
each
other
martin
could
not
make
out
what
they
said
but
suspected
that
they
were
talking
about
him
and
he
feared
that
their
remarks
were
not
always
of
a
friendly
nature
at
length
he
made
the
discovery
that
the
water
of
the
stream
was
perpetually
running
away
if
he
dropped
a
leaf
on
the
surface
it
would
hasten
down
stream
and
toss
about
and
fret
impatiently
against
anything
that
stood
in
its
way
until
making
its
escape
it
would
quickly
hurry
out
of
sight
whither
did
this
rippling
running
water
go
he
was
anxious
to
find
out
at
length
losing
all
fear
and
fired
with
the
sight
of
many
new
and
pretty
things
he
found
while
following
it
he
ran
along
the
banks
until
miles
from
home
he
came
to
a
great
lake
he
could
hardly
see
across
it
was
so
broad
it
was
a
wonderful
place
full
of
birds
not
small
fretful
creatures
flitting
in
and
out
of
the
rushes
but
great
majestic
birds
that
took
very
little
notice
of
him
far
out
on
the
blue
surface
of
the
water
floated
numbers
of
wild
fowl
and
chief
among
them
for
grace
and
beauty
was
the
swan
pure
white
with
black
head
and
neck
and
crimson
bill
there
also
were
stately
flamingoes
stalking
along
in
the
water
which
was
shallow
and
nearer
to
the
shore
were
flocks
of
spoonbills
and
solitary
big
grey
herons
standing
motionless
also
groups
of
white
egrets
and
a
great
multitude
of
glossy
ibises
with
dark
green
and
purple
plumage
and
long
beaks
the
sight
of
this
water
with
its
beds
of
rushes
and
tall
flowering
reeds
and
its
great
company
of
birds
filled
martin
with
delight
and
other
joys
were
soon
to
follow
throwing
off
his
shoes
he
dashed
with
a
shout
into
the
water
frightening
a
number
of
ibises
up
they
flew
each
bird
uttering
a
cry
repeated
many
times
that
sounded
just
like
his
old
father
laugh
when
he
laughed
loud
and
heartily
then
what
was
martin
amazement
to
hear
his
own
shout
and
this
chorus
of
bird
ha
ha
ha
repeated
by
hundreds
of
voices
all
over
the
lake
at
first
he
thought
that
the
other
birds
were
mocking
the
ibises
but
presently
he
shouted
again
and
again
his
shouts
were
repeated
by
dozens
of
voices
this
delighted
him
so
much
that
he
spent
the
whole
day
shouting
himself
hoarse
at
the
waterside
when
he
related
his
wonderful
experience
at
home
and
heard
from
his
father
that
the
sounds
he
had
heard
were
only
echoes
from
the
beds
of
rushes
he
was
not
a
bit
wiser
than
before
so
that
the
echoes
remained
to
him
a
continual
wonder
and
source
of
pleasure
every
day
he
would
take
some
noisy
instrument
to
the
lake
to
startle
the
echoes
a
whistle
his
father
made
him
served
for
a
time
after
that
he
marched
up
and
down
the
banks
rattling
a
tin
canister
with
pebbles
in
it
then
he
got
a
large
from
the
kitchen
and
beat
on
it
with
a
stick
every
day
for
about
a
fortnight
when
he
grew
tired
of
all
these
sounds
and
began
casting
about
for
some
new
thing
to
wake
the
echoes
with
he
all
at
once
remembered
his
father
gun
just
what
he
wanted
for
it
was
the
noisiest
thing
in
the
world
watching
his
opportunity
he
got
secretly
into
the
room
where
it
was
kept
loaded
and
succeeded
in
carrying
it
out
of
the
house
without
being
seen
then
full
of
joyful
anticipations
he
ran
as
fast
as
the
heavy
gun
would
let
him
to
his
favourite
haunt
when
he
arrived
at
the
lake
three
or
four
spoonbills
those
beautiful
tall
birds
were
standing
on
the
bank
quietly
dozing
in
the
hot
sunshine
they
did
not
fly
away
at
his
approach
for
the
birds
were
now
so
accustomed
to
martin
and
his
harmless
noises
that
they
took
very
little
notice
of
him
he
knelt
on
one
knee
and
pointed
the
gun
at
them
illustration
now
birdies
you
do
know
what
a
fright
i
going
to
give
you
off
you
go
he
cried
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
roar
of
the
loud
report
travelled
all
over
the
wide
lake
creating
a
great
commotion
among
the
feathered
people
and
they
rose
up
with
a
general
scream
into
the
air
all
this
was
of
no
benefit
to
martin
the
recoil
of
the
gun
having
sent
him
flying
over
his
heels
in
the
air
and
before
he
recovered
himself
the
echoes
were
silent
and
all
the
frightened
birds
were
settling
on
the
water
again
but
there
just
before
him
lay
one
of
the
spoonbills
beating
its
great
wings
against
the
ground
martin
ran
to
it
full
of
keen
distress
but
was
powerless
to
help
its
life
blood
was
fast
running
away
from
the
shot
wounds
it
had
received
in
its
side
staining
the
grass
with
crimson
presently
it
closed
its
beautiful
eyes
and
the
quivering
wings
grew
still
then
martin
sat
down
on
the
grass
by
its
side
and
began
to
cry
oh
that
great
bird
half
as
tall
as
himself
and
so
many
times
more
lovely
and
strong
and
beautiful
in
its
life
he
had
killed
it
and
it
would
never
fly
again
he
raised
it
up
very
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
kissed
it
kissed
its
pale
green
head
and
rosy
wings
then
out
of
his
arms
it
tumbled
back
again
on
to
the
grass
oh
poor
bird
he
cried
suddenly
open
your
wings
and
fly
away
but
it
was
dead
then
martin
got
up
and
stared
all
round
him
at
the
wide
landscape
and
everything
looked
strange
and
dim
and
sorrowful
a
shadow
passed
over
the
lake
and
a
murmur
came
up
out
of
the
rushes
that
was
like
a
voice
saying
something
that
he
could
not
understand
a
great
cry
of
pain
rose
from
his
heart
and
died
to
a
whisper
on
his
lips
he
was
awed
into
silence
sinking
down
upon
the
grass
again
he
hid
his
face
against
the
bird
and
began
to
sob
how
warm
the
dead
bird
felt
against
his
cheek
oh
so
warm
and
it
could
not
live
and
fly
about
with
the
others
at
length
he
sat
up
and
knew
the
reason
of
that
change
that
had
come
over
the
earth
a
dark
cloud
had
sprung
up
in
the
far
off
as
yet
and
near
the
horizon
but
its
fringe
already
touched
and
obscured
the
sun
and
a
shadow
flew
far
and
vast
before
it
over
the
lake
flew
that
great
shadow
the
waters
looked
cold
and
still
reflecting
as
in
a
polished
glass
the
motionless
rushes
the
glassy
bank
and
martin
sitting
on
it
still
clasping
in
his
arms
the
dead
bird
swifter
and
vaster
following
close
upon
the
flying
shadow
came
the
mighty
cloud
changing
from
black
to
slaty
grey
and
then
as
the
sun
broke
forth
again
under
its
lower
edge
it
was
all
flushed
with
a
brilliant
rose
colour
but
what
a
marvellous
thing
it
was
when
the
cloud
covered
a
third
of
the
wide
heavens
almost
touching
the
horizon
on
either
side
with
its
extremities
martin
gazing
steadily
at
it
saw
that
in
its
form
it
was
like
an
immense
spoonbill
flying
through
the
air
he
would
gladly
have
run
away
then
to
hide
himself
from
its
sight
but
he
dared
not
stir
for
it
was
now
directly
above
him
so
lying
down
on
the
grass
and
hiding
his
face
against
the
dead
bird
he
waited
in
fear
and
trembling
illustration
he
heard
the
rushing
sound
of
the
mighty
wings
the
wind
they
created
smote
on
the
waters
in
a
hurricane
so
that
the
reeds
were
beaten
flat
on
the
surface
and
a
great
cry
of
terror
went
up
from
all
the
wild
birds
it
passed
and
when
martin
raised
his
bowed
head
and
looked
again
the
sun
just
about
to
touch
the
horizon
with
its
great
red
globe
shone
out
shedding
a
rich
radiance
over
the
earth
and
water
while
far
off
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
heavens
the
great
was
rapidly
fading
out
of
sight
chapter
iii
chasing
a
flying
figure
after
what
had
happened
martin
could
never
visit
the
waterside
and
look
at
the
great
birds
wading
and
swimming
there
without
a
feeling
that
was
like
a
sudden
coldness
in
the
blood
of
his
veins
the
rosy
spoonbill
he
had
killed
and
cried
over
and
the
great
that
had
frightened
him
were
never
forgotten
he
grew
tired
of
shouting
to
the
echoes
he
discovered
that
there
were
even
more
wonderful
things
than
the
marsh
echoes
in
the
world
and
that
the
world
was
bigger
than
he
had
thought
it
when
spring
with
its
moist
verdure
and
frail
flowers
had
gone
when
the
great
plain
began
to
turn
to
a
colour
and
the
dry
hard
earth
was
full
of
cracks
and
the
days
grew
longer
and
the
heat
greater
there
came
an
appearance
of
water
that
quivered
and
glittered
and
danced
before
his
wondering
sight
and
would
lead
him
miles
from
home
every
day
in
his
vain
efforts
to
find
out
what
it
was
he
could
talk
of
nothing
else
and
asked
endless
questions
about
it
and
they
told
him
that
this
strange
thing
was
nothing
but
the
mirage
but
of
course
that
was
not
telling
him
enough
so
that
he
was
left
to
puzzle
his
little
over
this
new
mystery
just
as
they
had
puzzled
before
over
the
mystery
of
the
echoes
now
this
mirage
was
a
glittering
whiteness
that
looked
just
like
water
always
shining
and
dancing
before
him
and
all
round
him
on
the
dry
level
plain
where
there
was
no
water
it
was
never
quiet
but
perpetually
quivering
and
running
into
wavelets
that
threw
up
crests
and
jets
of
sprays
as
from
a
fountain
and
showers
of
brilliant
drops
that
flashed
like
molten
silver
in
the
sunlight
before
they
broke
and
vanished
only
to
be
renewed
again
it
appeared
every
day
when
the
sun
was
high
and
the
air
hot
and
it
was
often
called
false
and
false
it
was
since
it
always
flew
before
him
as
he
ran
so
that
although
he
often
seemed
to
be
getting
nearer
to
it
he
could
never
quite
overtake
it
but
martin
had
a
very
determined
spirit
for
a
small
boy
and
although
this
appearance
of
water
mocked
his
efforts
a
hundred
times
every
day
with
its
vanishing
brightness
and
beauty
he
would
not
give
up
the
pursuit
now
one
day
when
there
was
not
a
cloud
on
the
great
hot
sky
nor
a
breath
of
air
stirring
when
it
was
all
silent
for
not
even
a
creaked
in
the
dead
yellow
motionless
grass
the
whole
level
earth
began
to
shine
and
sparkle
like
a
lake
of
silvery
water
as
martin
had
never
seen
it
shine
before
he
had
wandered
far
away
from
home
never
had
he
been
so
far
and
still
he
ran
and
ran
and
ran
and
still
that
whiteness
quivered
and
glittered
and
flew
on
before
him
and
ever
it
looked
more
temptingly
near
urging
him
to
fresh
exertions
at
length
tired
out
and
overcome
with
heat
he
sat
down
to
rest
and
feeling
very
much
hurt
at
the
way
he
had
been
deceived
and
led
on
he
shed
one
little
tear
there
was
no
mistake
about
that
tear
he
felt
it
running
like
a
small
spider
down
his
cheek
and
finally
he
saw
it
fall
it
fell
on
to
a
blade
of
yellow
grass
and
ran
down
the
blade
then
stopped
so
as
to
gather
itself
into
a
little
round
drop
before
touching
the
ground
just
then
out
of
the
roots
of
the
grass
beneath
it
crept
a
tiny
dusty
black
beetle
and
began
drinking
the
drop
waving
its
little
horns
up
and
down
like
donkey
ears
apparently
very
much
pleased
at
its
good
fortune
in
finding
water
and
having
a
good
drink
in
such
a
dry
thirsty
place
probably
it
took
the
tear
for
a
drop
of
rain
just
fallen
out
of
the
sky
you
a
funny
little
thing
exclaimed
martin
feeling
now
less
like
crying
than
laughing
the
wee
beetle
satisfied
and
refreshed
climbed
up
the
and
when
it
reached
the
tip
lifted
its
dusty
black
just
enough
to
throw
out
a
pair
of
fine
gauzy
wings
that
had
been
neatly
folded
up
beneath
them
and
flew
away
illustration
martin
following
its
flight
had
his
eyes
quite
dazzled
by
the
intense
glitter
of
the
false
water
which
now
seemed
to
be
only
a
few
yards
from
him
but
the
strangest
thing
was
that
in
it
there
appeared
a
form
a
bright
beautiful
form
that
vanished
when
he
gazed
steadily
at
it
again
he
got
up
and
began
running
harder
than
ever
after
the
flying
mocking
mirage
and
every
time
he
stopped
he
fancied
that
he
could
see
the
figure
again
sometimes
like
a
pale
blue
shadow
on
the
brightness
sometimes
shining
with
its
own
excessive
light
and
sometimes
only
seen
in
outline
like
a
figure
graved
on
glass
and
always
vanishing
when
looked
at
steadily
perhaps
that
white
glitter
of
the
mirage
was
like
a
and
he
was
only
chasing
his
own
reflection
i
can
not
say
but
there
it
was
always
before
him
a
face
as
of
a
beautiful
boy
with
tumbled
hair
and
laughing
lips
its
figure
clothed
in
a
fluttering
dress
of
lights
and
shadows
it
also
seemed
to
beckon
to
him
with
its
hand
and
encourage
him
to
run
on
after
it
with
its
bright
merry
glances
illustration
at
length
when
it
was
past
the
hour
of
noon
martin
sat
down
under
a
small
bush
that
gave
just
shade
enough
to
cover
him
and
none
to
spare
it
was
only
a
little
spot
of
shade
like
an
island
in
a
sea
of
heat
and
brightness
he
was
too
hot
and
tired
to
run
more
too
tired
even
to
keep
his
eyes
open
and
so
propping
his
back
against
the
stem
of
the
small
bush
he
closed
his
tired
hot
eyes
chapter
iv
martin
is
found
by
a
deaf
old
man
martin
kept
his
eyes
shut
for
only
about
a
minute
as
he
thought
but
he
must
have
been
asleep
some
time
for
when
he
opened
them
the
false
water
had
vanished
and
the
sun
looking
very
large
and
crimson
was
just
about
to
set
he
started
up
feeling
very
thirsty
and
hungry
and
bewildered
for
he
was
far
far
from
home
and
lost
on
the
great
plain
presently
he
spied
a
man
coming
towards
him
on
horseback
a
very
old
man
he
proved
to
be
with
a
face
wrinkled
and
tanned
by
sun
and
wind
until
it
resembled
a
piece
of
ancient
left
lying
for
years
on
some
neglected
spot
of
ground
a
brazil
nut
is
not
darker
nor
more
wrinkled
than
was
the
old
man
face
his
long
matted
beard
and
hair
had
once
been
white
but
the
sun
out
of
doors
and
the
smoke
in
his
smoky
hut
had
given
them
a
yellowish
tinge
so
that
they
looked
like
dry
dead
grass
he
wore
big
patched
all
over
and
full
of
cracks
and
holes
and
a
great
rusty
and
ragged
fastened
with
horn
buttons
big
as
saucers
his
old
brimless
hat
looked
like
a
dilapidated
on
his
head
and
to
prevent
it
from
being
carried
off
by
the
wind
it
was
kept
on
with
an
old
flannel
shirtsleeve
tied
under
his
chin
his
saddle
too
like
his
clothes
was
old
and
full
of
rents
with
wisps
of
hair
and
sticking
out
in
various
places
and
his
feet
were
thrust
into
a
pair
of
big
stirrups
made
of
pieces
of
wood
and
rusty
iron
tied
together
with
string
and
wire
illustration
boy
what
may
you
being
a
doing
of
here
bawled
this
old
man
at
the
top
of
his
voice
for
he
was
as
deaf
as
a
post
and
like
a
good
many
deaf
people
thought
it
necessary
to
speak
very
loud
to
make
himself
heard
playing
answered
martin
innocently
but
he
could
not
make
the
old
man
hear
until
he
stood
up
on
and
shouted
out
his
answer
as
loud
as
he
could
playing
exclaimed
the
old
man
well
i
never
in
all
my
life
when
there
ai
a
house
my
own
for
leagues
and
leagues
and
he
says
he
playing
what
may
you
be
now
he
shouted
again
a
little
boy
screamed
martin
i
knowed
that
afore
i
axed
said
the
other
then
he
slapped
his
legs
and
held
up
his
hands
with
astonishment
and
at
last
began
to
chuckle
will
you
come
home
along
o
me
he
shouted
will
you
give
me
something
to
eat
asked
martin
in
return
haw
haw
haw
guffawed
the
old
fellow
it
was
a
tremendous
laugh
so
loud
and
hollow
it
astonished
and
almost
frightened
martin
to
hear
it
well
i
never
he
said
he
ai
no
fool
neither
now
old
jacob
just
you
take
your
time
and
think
a
bit
afore
you
makes
your
answer
to
that
this
curious
old
man
whose
name
was
jacob
had
lived
so
long
by
himself
that
he
always
thought
out
loud
louder
than
other
people
talk
for
being
deaf
he
could
not
hear
himself
and
never
had
a
suspicion
that
he
could
be
heard
by
others
he
lost
that
what
he
is
continued
old
jacob
aloud
to
himself
and
what
more
he
been
and
gone
and
forgot
all
about
his
own
home
and
all
he
wants
is
summat
to
eat
i
take
him
and
keep
him
that
what
i
do
for
he
a
stray
lamb
and
belongs
to
him
that
finds
him
like
any
other
lamb
i
finds
i
make
him
believe
his
old
dad
for
he
little
and
will
believe
most
anything
you
tells
him
i
learn
him
to
do
things
about
the
house
to
boil
the
kettle
and
cook
the
wittels
and
gather
the
firewood
and
mend
the
clothes
and
do
the
washing
and
draw
the
water
and
milk
the
cow
and
dig
the
potatoes
and
mind
the
sheep
and
and
and
that
what
i
learn
him
then
jacob
you
can
sit
down
and
smoke
your
pipe
you
have
some
one
to
do
your
work
for
you
martin
stood
quietly
listening
to
all
this
not
quite
understanding
the
old
man
kind
intentions
then
old
jacob
promising
to
give
him
something
to
eat
pulled
him
up
on
to
his
horse
and
started
home
at
a
gallop
soon
they
arrived
at
a
mud
hovel
thatched
with
rushes
the
roof
sloping
down
so
low
that
one
could
almost
step
on
to
it
it
was
surrounded
with
a
ditch
and
had
a
potato
patch
and
a
sheep
enclosure
for
old
jacob
was
a
shepherd
and
had
a
flock
of
sheep
there
were
several
big
dogs
and
when
martin
got
down
from
the
horse
they
began
jumping
round
him
barking
with
delight
as
if
they
knew
him
him
with
their
rough
caresses
jacob
led
him
into
the
hut
which
looked
extremely
dirty
and
neglected
and
had
only
one
room
in
the
corners
against
the
walls
were
piles
of
that
had
a
strong
and
rather
unpleasant
smell
the
thatch
above
was
covered
with
dusty
cobwebs
hanging
like
old
rags
and
the
clay
floor
was
littered
with
bones
sticks
and
other
rubbish
the
only
nice
thing
to
see
was
a
teakettle
singing
and
steaming
away
merrily
on
the
fire
in
the
grate
old
jacob
set
about
preparing
the
evening
meal
and
soon
they
sat
down
at
a
small
deal
table
to
a
supper
of
cold
mutton
and
potatoes
and
tea
which
did
not
taste
very
nice
as
it
was
sweetened
with
moist
black
sugar
martin
was
too
hungry
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
anything
and
while
he
ate
and
drank
the
old
man
chuckled
and
talked
aloud
to
himself
about
his
good
fortune
in
finding
the
little
boy
to
do
his
work
for
him
after
supper
he
cleared
the
table
and
put
two
mugs
of
tea
on
it
and
then
got
out
his
clay
pipe
and
tobacco
now
little
boy
he
cried
let
have
a
jolly
evening
together
your
very
good
health
little
boy
and
here
he
jingled
his
mug
against
martin
and
took
a
sip
of
tea
would
you
like
to
hear
a
song
little
boy
he
said
after
finishing
his
pipe
no
said
martin
who
was
getting
sleepy
but
jacob
took
no
to
mean
yes
and
so
he
stood
up
on
his
legs
and
sang
this
song
my
name
is
jacob
that
my
name
and
tho
i
old

old
man

now
lend
to
me
a
skin
or
two
to
keep
the
cold
and
wet
from
out
o
me
this
song
accompanied
with
loud
raps
on
the
table
was
bellowed
forth
in
a
dreadfully
discordant
voice
and
very
soon
all
the
dogs
rushed
into
the
room
and
began
to
bark
and
howl
most
dismally
which
seemed
to
please
the
old
man
greatly
for
to
him
it
was
a
kind
of
applause
but
the
noise
was
too
much
for
martin
so
he
stopped
up
his
ears
and
only
removed
his
fingers
from
them
when
the
performance
was
over
after
the
song
the
old
man
offered
to
dance
for
he
had
not
yet
had
amusement
enough
boy
can
you
play
on
this
he
shouted
holding
up
a
and
a
big
stick
to
beat
it
with
of
course
martin
could
play
on
instrument
he
had
often
enough
played
on
one
like
it
to
startle
the
echoes
on
the
lake
in
other
days
and
so
when
he
had
been
lifted
on
to
the
table
he
took
the
by
the
handle
and
began
vigorously
beating
on
it
with
the
stick
he
did
not
mind
the
noise
now
since
he
was
helping
to
make
it
meanwhile
old
jacob
began
flinging
his
arms
and
legs
about
in
all
directions
looking
like
a
scarecrow
made
to
tumble
about
by
means
of
springs
and
wires
he
pounded
the
clay
floor
with
his
ponderous
old
boots
until
the
room
was
filled
with
a
cloud
of
dust
then
in
his
excitement
he
kicked
over
chairs
pots
kettles
and
whatever
came
in
his
way
while
he
kept
on
revolving
round
the
table
in
a
kind
of
crazy
fandango
martin
thought
it
fine
fun
and
screamed
with
laughter
and
beat
his
gong
louder
than
ever
then
to
make
matters
worse
old
jacob
at
intervals
uttered
whoops
and
yells
which
the
dogs
answered
with
long
howls
from
the
door
until
the
din
was
something
tremendous
illustration
at
length
they
both
grew
tired
and
then
after
resting
and
sipping
some
more
cold
tea
prepared
to
go
to
bed
some
were
piled
up
in
a
corner
for
martin
to
sleep
on
and
old
jacob
covered
him
with
a
and
tucked
him
in
very
carefully
then
the
kind
old
man
withdrew
to
his
own
bed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
about
midnight
martin
was
wakened
by
loud
horrible
noises
in
the
room
and
started
up
on
bed
trembling
with
fear
the
sounds
came
from
the
old
man
nose
and
resembled
a
succession
of
blasts
on
a
ram
horn
which
on
account
of
its
roughness
and
twisted
shape
makes
a
very
bad
trumpet
as
soon
as
martin
discovered
the
cause
of
the
noise
he
crept
out
of
bed
and
tried
to
waken
the
old
snorer
by
shouting
at
him
tugging
at
his
arms
and
legs
and
finally
pulling
his
beard
he
refused
to
wake
then
martin
had
a
bright
idea
and
groping
his
way
to
the
bucket
of
cold
water
standing
beside
the
he
managed
to
raise
it
up
in
his
arms
and
poured
it
over
the
sleeper
the
snoring
changed
to
a
series
of
loud
choking
snorts
then
ceased
martin
well
pleased
at
the
success
of
his
experiment
was
about
to
return
to
his
bed
when
old
jacob
struggled
up
to
a
sitting
posture
hullo
wake
up
little
boy
he
shouted
my
bed
all
full
water
goodness
knows
where
it
comes
from
i
poured
it
over
you
to
wake
you
up
do
you
know
you
were
making
a
noise
with
your
nose
cried
martin
at
the
top
of
his
voice
you
you
you
throwed
it
over
me
you
o
you
most
wicked
little
villain
you
you
throwed
it
over
me
did
you
and
here
he
poured
out
such
a
torrent
of
abusive
words
that
martin
was
horrified
and
cried
out
o
what
a
naughty
wicked
bad
old
man
you
are
it
was
too
dark
for
old
jacob
to
see
him
but
he
knew
his
way
about
the
room
and
taking
up
the
wet
rug
that
served
him
for
covering
he
groped
his
way
to
martin
bed
and
began
pounding
it
with
the
rug
thinking
the
naughty
little
boy
was
there
you
little
rascal
you
i
hope
you
like
that
and
that
and
that
he
shouted
pounding
away
i
learn

to
throw
water
over
your
poor
old
dad
and
such
a
a
affectionate
father
as

and

now
boy
you
may
go
and
sleep
on
my
bed
it
wet
d
see
and
i
sleep
on
yourn
it
dry
then
he
got
into
martin
bed
and
muttered
and
grumbled
himself
to
sleep
martin
came
out
from
under
the
table
and
after
dressing
himself
with
great
secrecy
crept
to
the
door
to
make
his
escape
it
was
locked
and
the
key
taken
away
but
he
was
determined
to
make
his
escape
somehow
and
not
wait
to
be
whipped
so
by
and
by
he
drew
the
little
deal
table
close
against
the
wall
and
getting
on
to
it
began
picking
the
rushes
one
by
one
out
of
the
lower
part
of
the
thatch
after
working
for
like
a
mouse
eating
his
way
out
of
a
soft
wooden
box
he
began
to
see
the
light
coming
through
the
hole
and
in
another
half
hour
it
was
large
enough
for
him
to
creep
through
when
he
had
got
out
he
slipped
down
to
the
ground
where
the
dogs
were
lying
they
seemed
very
glad
to
see
him
and
began
pressing
round
to
lick
his
face
but
he
pushed
them
off
and
ran
away
over
the
plain
as
fast
as
he
could
the
stars
were
shining
but
it
was
very
dark
and
silent
only
in
moist
places
where
the
grass
grew
tall
he
heard
the
crickets
strumming
sadly
on
their
little
harps
at
length
tired
with
running
he
coiled
himself
in
a
large
tussock
of
dry
grass
and
went
to
sleep
just
as
if
he
had
been
accustomed
to
sleep
out
of
doors
all
his
life
chapter
v
the
people
of
the
mirage
in
that
remote
land
where
martin
was
born
with
its
bright
warm
climate
and
rich
soil
no
person
need
go
very
long
hungry
not
even
a
small
boy
alone
and
lost
on
the
great
grassy
plain
for
there
is
a
little
useful
plant
in
that
place
with
small
leaves
like
clover
leaves
and
a
pretty
yellow
flower
which
bears
a
wholesome
sweet
root
about
as
big
as
a
pigeon
egg
and
of
a
pearly
white
colour
it
is
so
well
known
to
the
settlers
children
in
that
desert
country
that
they
are
always
wandering
off
to
the
plain
to
look
for
it
just
as
the
children
in
a
town
are
always
running
off
with
their
halfpence
to
the
shop
this
pretty
white
root
is
watery
so
that
it
satisfies
both
hunger
and
thirst
at
the
same
time
now
when
martin
woke
next
morning
he
found
a
great
many
of
the
little
plants
growing
close
to
the
spot
where
he
had
slept
and
they
supplied
him
with
a
nice
sweet
breakfast
after
he
had
eaten
enough
and
had
amused
himself
by
rolling
over
and
over
several
times
on
the
grass
he
started
once
more
on
his
travels
going
towards
the
sunrise
as
fast
as
he
could
run
he
could
run
well
for
a
small
boy
but
he
got
tired
at
last
and
sat
down
to
rest
then
he
jumped
up
and
went
on
again
at
a
trot
this
pace
he
kept
up
very
steadily
only
pausing
from
time
to
time
to
watch
a
flock
of
small
white
birds
that
followed
him
all
the
morning
out
of
curiosity
at
length
he
began
to
feel
so
hot
and
tired
that
he
could
only
walk
still
he
kept
on
he
could
see
no
flowers
nor
anything
pretty
in
that
place
why
should
he
stay
in
it
he
would
go
on
and
on
and
on
in
spite
of
the
heat
until
he
came
to
something
but
it
grew
hotter
as
the
day
advanced
and
the
ground
about
him
more
dry
and
barren
and
desolate
until
at
last
he
came
to
ground
where
there
was
scarcely
a
blade
of
grass
it
was
a
great
barren
level
plain
covered
with
a
slight
crust
of
salt
crystals
that
glittered
in
the
sun
so
brightly
that
it
dazzled
and
pained
his
eyesight
here
were
no
sweet
watery
roots
for
refreshment
and
no
berries
nor
could
martin
find
a
bush
to
give
him
a
little
shade
and
protection
from
the
burning
noonday
sun
he
saw
one
large
dark
object
in
the
distance
and
mistaking
it
for
a
bush
covered
with
thick
foliage
he
ran
towards
it
but
suddenly
it
started
up
when
he
was
near
and
waving
its
great
grey
and
white
wings
like
sails
fled
across
the
plain
it
was
an
ostrich
now
this
hot
shadeless
plain
seemed
to
be
the
very
home
and
of
the
false
water
it
sparkled
and
danced
all
round
him
so
close
that
there
only
appeared
to
be
a
small
space
of
dry
ground
for
him
to
walk
on
only
he
was
always
exactly
in
the
centre
of
the
dry
spot
for
as
he
advanced
the
glittering
whiteness
that
looked
so
like
shiny
water
flew
mockingly
before
his
steps
but
he
hoped
to
get
to
it
at
last
as
every
time
he
flagged
in
the
chase
the
mysterious
figure
of
the
day
before
appeared
again
to
lure
him
still
further
on
at
length
unable
to
move
another
step
martin
sat
right
down
on
the
bare
ground
it
was
like
sitting
on
the
floor
of
a
heated
oven
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
was
so
tired
the
air
was
so
thick
and
heavy
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
even
with
his
mouth
wide
open
like
a
little
gasping
bird
and
the
sky
looked
like
metal
heated
to
a
white
heat
and
so
low
down
as
to
make
him
fancy
that
if
he
were
to
throw
up
his
hands
he
would
touch
it
and
burn
his
fingers
and
the
mirage
oh
how
it
glistened
and
quivered
here
where
he
had
sat
down
half
blinding
him
with
its
brightness
now
that
he
could
no
longer
run
after
it
nor
even
walk
it
came
to
him
breaking
round
and
over
him
in
a
thousand
fantastic
shapes
filling
the
air
with
a
million
white
flakes
that
whirled
about
as
if
driven
by
a
furious
wind
although
not
a
breath
was
stirring
they
looked
like
whitest
yet
stung
his
cheeks
like
sparks
of
fire
not
only
did
he
see
and
feel
he
could
even
it
now
his
ears
were
filled
with
a
humming
sound
growing
louder
and
louder
every
minute
like
the
noise
made
by
a
large
colony
of
when
a
person
carelessly
treads
on
their
nest
and
they
are
angered
and
thrown
into
a
great
commotion
and
swarm
out
to
defend
their
home
very
soon
out
of
this
confused
murmur
louder
clearer
sounds
began
to
rise
and
these
could
be
distinguished
as
the
notes
of
numberless
musical
instruments
and
voices
of
people
singing
talking
and
laughing
then
all
at
once
there
appeared
running
and
skipping
over
the
ground
towards
him
a
great
company
of
girls
scores
and
hundreds
of
them
scattered
over
the
plain
exceeding
in
loveliness
all
lovely
things
that
he
had
ever
beheld
their
faces
were
whiter
than
lilies
and
their
loose
fluttering
hair
looked
like
a
mist
of
pale
shining
gold
and
their
skirts
that
rustled
as
they
ran
were
also
shining
like
the
wings
of
and
were
touched
with
brown
reflections
and
changing
beautiful
tints
such
as
are
seen
on
each
of
them
carried
a
silver
pitcher
and
as
they
ran
and
skipped
along
they
dipped
their
fingers
in
and
sprinkled
the
desert
with
water
the
bright
drops
they
scattered
fell
all
around
in
a
grateful
shower
and
flew
up
again
from
the
heated
earth
in
the
form
of
a
white
mist
touched
with
rainbow
colours
filling
the
air
with
a
refreshing
coolness
at
martin
side
there
grew
a
small
plant
its
leaves
lying
wilted
on
the
ground
and
one
of
the
girls
paused
to
water
it
and
as
she
sprinkled
the
drops
on
it
she
sang
little
weed
little
weed
in
such
need
must
you
pain
ask
in
vain
die
for
rain
never
bloom
never
seed
little
weed
o
no
no
you
shall
not
die
from
the
sky
with
my
pitcher
down
i
fly
drink
the
rain
grow
again
bloom
and
seed
little
weed
martin
held
up
his
hot
little
hands
to
catch
some
of
the
falling
drops
then
the
girl
raising
her
pitcher
poured
a
stream
of
cool
water
right
into
his
face
and
laughing
at
what
she
had
done
went
away
with
a
hop
skip
and
jump
after
her
companions
the
girls
with
pitchers
had
all
gone
and
were
succeeded
by
troops
of
boys
just
as
beautiful
many
of
them
singing
and
some
playing
on
wind
and
stringed
instruments
and
some
were
running
others
quietly
walking
and
still
others
riding
on
various
animals
ostriches
sheep
goats
fawns
and
small
donkeys
all
pure
white
one
boy
was
riding
on
a
ram
and
as
he
came
by
on
a
little
banjo
he
sang
a
very
curious
song
which
made
martin
prick
up
his
ears
to
listen
it
was
about
a
speckled
snake
that
lived
far
away
on
a
piece
of
waste
ground
how
day
after
day
he
sought
for
his
lost
playmate
the
little
boy
that
had
left
him
how
he
glided
this
way
and
that
on
his
smooth
bright
belly
winding
in
and
out
among
the
tall
wild
sunflowers
how
he
listened
for
the
dear
footsteps
listened
with
his
green
little
head
raised
high
among
the
leaves
but
his
playmate
was
far
away
and
came
no
more
to
feed
him
from
his
basin
of
bread
and
milk
and
caress
his
cold
smooth
coils
with
his
warm
soft
little
hand
close
after
the
boy
on
the
ram
marched
four
other
little
boys
on
foot
holding
up
long
silver
trumpets
in
readiness
to
blow
one
of
them
stopped
and
putting
his
trumpet
down
close
to
martin
ear
puffed
out
his
little
round
cheeks
and
blew
a
blast
that
made
him
jump
laughing
at
the
joke
they
passed
on
and
were
succeeded
by
others
and
still
others
singing
shouting
twanging
their
instruments
and
some
of
them
stopping
for
a
few
moments
to
look
at
martin
or
play
some
pretty
little
trick
on
him
but
now
all
at
once
martin
ceased
to
listen
or
even
look
at
them
for
something
new
and
different
was
coming
something
strange
which
made
him
curious
and
afraid
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
sound
very
deep
and
solemn
of
men
voices
singing
together
a
song
that
was
like
a
dirge
and
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
it
was
like
the
coming
of
a
storm
with
wind
and
rain
and
thunder
soon
he
could
see
them
marching
through
the
great
crowd
of
people
old
men
moving
in
a
slow
procession
and
they
had
pale
dark
faces
and
their
hair
and
long
beards
were
whiter
than
snow
and
their
long
flowing
robes
were
of
the
silvery
dark
colour
of
a
then
he
saw
that
the
leaders
of
the
procession
were
followed
by
others
who
carried
a
couch
of
resting
on
their
shoulders
that
on
the
couch
reposed
a
pale
youth
dressed
in
silk
clothes
of
a
delicate
he
also
wore
crimson
shoes
and
a
skull
cap
which
made
his
head
look
very
small
his
eyes
were
and
he
had
a
long
slender
nose
like
a
snipe
bill
only
broad
and
flattened
at
the
tip
and
then
martin
saw
that
he
was
wounded
for
he
had
one
white
hand
pressed
to
his
side
and
it
was
stained
with
blood
and
drops
of
blood
were
trickling
through
his
fingers
he
was
troubled
at
the
sight
and
he
gazed
at
him
and
listened
to
the
words
of
that
solemn
song
the
old
men
were
singing
but
could
not
understand
them
not
because
he
was
a
child
for
no
person
however
aged
and
wise
and
filled
with
all
learning
he
might
be
could
have
understood
that
strange
song
about
wonderful
life
and
wonderful
death
yet
there
was
something
in
it
too
which
any
one
who
heard
it
man
or
child
could
understand
and
he
understood
it
and
it
went
into
his
heart
to
make
it
so
heavy
and
sad
that
he
could
have
put
his
little
face
down
on
the
ground
and
cried
as
he
had
never
cried
before
but
he
did
not
put
his
face
down
and
cry
for
just
then
the
wounded
youth
looked
down
on
him
as
they
carried
him
past
and
smiled
a
very
sweet
smile
then
martin
felt
that
he
loved
him
above
all
the
bright
and
beautiful
beings
that
had
passed
before
him
then
when
he
was
gone
from
sight
when
the
solemn
sound
of
the
voices
began
to
grow
fainter
in
the
distance
like
the
sound
of
a
storm
when
it
passes
away
his
heaviness
of
heart
and
sorrow
left
him
and
he
began
to
listen
to
the
shouts
and
cries
and
clanging
of
noisy
instruments
of
music
swiftly
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
all
round
and
past
him
came
a
vast
company
of
youths
and
maidens
singing
and
playing
and
shouting
and
dancing
as
they
moved
onwards
they
were
the
most
beautiful
beings
he
had
ever
seen
in
their
shining
dresses
some
all
in
white
others
in
others
in
and
some
in
still
other
lovely
colours
the
queen
the
queen
they
were
shouting
stand
up
little
boy
and
bow
to
the
queen
the
queen
kneel
to
the
queen
little
boy
cried
others
then
many
others
in
the
company
began
crying
out
together
the
queen
lie
down
flat
on
the
ground
little
boy
the
queen
shut
your
eyes
and
open
your
mouth
little
boy
the
queen
run
away
as
fast
as
you
can
little
boy
stand
on
your
head
to
the
queen
little
boy
crow
like
a
cock
and
bark
like
a
dog
little
boy
trying
to
obey
all
these
conflicting
commands
at
one
and
the
same
time
poor
martin
made
strange
noises
and
tumbled
about
this
way
and
that
and
set
them
all
laughing
at
him
the
queen
wishes
to
speak
to
you
stand
up
little
boy
said
one
of
the
brightest
beings
touching
martin
on
the
cheek
there
before
him
surrounded
by
all
that
beautiful
company
stood
the
horses
that
drew
her
great
horses
impatiently
pawing
the
dusty
ground
with
their
hoofs
and
proudly
champing
their
gold
bridles
tossing
the
white
froth
from
their
mouths
but
when
he
lifted
his
eyes
timidly
to
the
majestic
being
seated
in
her
chariot
before
him
he
was
dazzled
and
overcome
with
the
sight
her
face
had
a
brightness
that
was
like
that
of
the
mirage
at
noon
and
the
eyes
that
gazed
on
him
were
like
two
great
opals
she
appeared
clothed
in
a
white
shining
mist
and
her
hair
spread
wide
on
her
shoulders
looked
white
whiter
than
a
lamb
fleece
and
powdered
with
fine
gold
that
sparkled
and
quivered
and
ran
through
it
like
sparks
of
yellow
fire
and
on
her
head
she
wore
a
crown
that
was
like
a
diamond
seen
by
or
like
a
dewdrop
in
the
sun
and
every
moment
it
changed
its
colour
and
by
turns
was
a
red
flame
then
a
green
then
a
yellow
then
a
violet
illustration
child
you
have
followed
me
far
said
the
queen
and
now
you
are
rewarded
for
you
have
looked
on
my
face
and
i
have
refreshed
you
and
the
sun
my
father
will
never
more
hurt
you
for
my
sake
he
is
a
naughty
boy
and
unworthy
of
your
goodness
spoke
one
of
the
bright
beings
standing
near
he
killed
the
spoonbill
he
cried
for
the
poor
slain
bird
replied
the
queen
he
will
never
remember
it
without
grief
and
i
forgive
him
he
went
away
from
his
home
and
thinks
no
more
of
his
poor
old
father
and
mother
who
cry
for
him
and
are
seeking
for
him
on
the
great
plain
continued
the
voice
i
forgive
him
returned
the
queen
he
is
such
a
little
wanderer
he
could
not
always
rest
at
home
he
emptied
a
bucketful
of
water
over
good
old
jacob
who
found
him
and
took
him
in
and
fed
him
and
sang
to
him
and
danced
to
him
and
was
a
second
father
to
him
at
that
there
was
great
laughter
even
the
queen
laughed
when
she
said
that
she
forgave
him
that
too
and
martin
when
he
remembered
old
jacob
and
saw
that
they
only
made
a
joke
of
it
laughed
with
them
but
the
accusing
voice
still
went
on
and
when
the
good
old
shepherd
went
to
sleep
a
second
time
then
the
naughty
little
boy
climbed
on
the
table
and
picked
a
hole
in
the
thatch
and
got
out
and
ran
away
another
burst
of
laughter
followed
then
a
youth
in
a
shining
dress
suddenly
began
twanging
on
his
instrument
and
wildly
capering
about
in
imitation
of
old
jacob
dancing
and
while
he
played
and
danced
he
sang
ho
sheep
whose
ways
are
known
to
me
both
ewe
and
lamb
and
horned
ram
wherever
can
that
martin
be
all
day
for
him
i
ride
over
the
plains
so
wide
and
on
my
horn
i
blow
just
to
let
him
know
that
jacob
on
his
track
and
soon
will
have
him
back
i
look
and
look
all
day
and
when
i
home
i
say
he
is
like
a
mole
to
dig
himself
a
hole
them
little
legs
he
got
they
ca
go
far
trot
trot
they
ca
go
far
run
run
oh
no
it
is
his
fun
i
sure
he
near
he
must
be
here
round
the
house
just
like
a
little
mouse
i
get
a
in
a
minute
and
bait
with
cheese
that
smelly
to
bring
him
that
little
empty
belly
and
then
i
have
him
in
it
where
have
he
hid
that
little
kid
that
good
old
jacob
was
so
kind
to
and
when
a
rest
i
am
inclined
to
who
boil
the
cow
and
dig
the
kittles
and
milk
the
stockings
darn
the
wittles
who
mugs
of
tea
will
drink
with
me
when
round
and
round
i
pound
the
ground
with
boots
of
cowhide
boots
of
thunder
who
help
to
make
the
noise
i
wonder
who
join
the
row
of
loud
with
din
of
tin
and
copper
clatter
with
bang
and
whang
of
pan
and
platter
o
when
i
find
him
fast
i
bind
and
upside
down
i
hold
him
and
when
i
gallop
i
give
him
no
more
cold
potato
but
cuff
him
box
him
bang
him
scold
him
and
drench
him
with
a
pail
of
water
and
fill
his
mouth
with
wool
and
mortar
because
he
do
do
things
he
oughter
but
does
the
things
he
ought
not
to
then
tell
me
true
both
ram
and
ewe
wherever
have
that
martin
got
to
for
jacob
old
and
deaf
and
dim
and
never
knowed
the
ways
of
him
i
forgive
him
everything
said
the
queen
very
graciously
when
the
song
ended
at
which
they
all
laughed
and
now
let
two
of
you
speak
and
each
bestow
a
gift
on
him
he
deserves
to
be
rewarded
for
running
so
far
after
us
then
one
of
those
bright
beautiful
beings
came
forward
and
cried
out
he
loves
wandering
let
him
have
his
will
and
be
a
wanderer
all
his
days
on
the
face
of
the
earth
well
spoken
cried
the
queen
a
wanderer
he
is
to
be
said
another
let
the
sea
do
him
no
harm
that
is
my
gift
so
be
it
said
the
queen
and
to
your
two
gifts
i
shall
add
a
third
let
all
men
love
him
go
now
martin
you
are
well
equipped
and
satisfy
your
heart
with
the
sight
of
all
the
strange
and
beautiful
things
the
world
contains
kneel
and
thank
the
queen
for
her
gifts
said
a
voice
to
martin
he
dropped
on
to
his
knees
but
could
speak
no
word
when
he
raised
his
eyes
again
the
whole
glorious
company
had
vanished
illustration
the
air
was
cool
and
fragrant
the
earth
moist
as
if
a
shower
had
just
fallen
he
got
up
and
slowly
walked
onward
until
near
sunset
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
beautiful
people
of
the
mirage
he
had
left
the
barren
salt
plain
behind
by
now
the
earth
was
covered
with
yellow
grass
and
he
found
and
ate
some
sweet
roots
and
berries
then
feeling
very
tired
he
stretched
himself
out
on
his
back
and
began
to
wonder
if
what
he
had
seen
was
nothing
but
a
dream
yes
it
was
surely
a
dream
but
then
in
his
life
dreams
and
realities
were
so
mixed
how
was
he
always
to
know
one
from
the
other
which
was
most
strange
the
mirage
that
glittered
and
quivered
round
him
and
flew
mockingly
before
him
or
the
people
of
the
mirage
he
had
seen
if
you
are
lying
quite
still
with
your
eyes
shut
and
some
one
comes
softly
up
and
stands
over
you
somehow
you
know
it
and
open
your
eyes
to
see
who
it
is
just
in
that
way
martin
knew
that
some
one
had
come
and
was
standing
over
him
still
he
kept
his
eyes
shut
feeling
sure
that
it
was
one
of
those
bright
and
beautiful
beings
he
had
lately
seen
perhaps
the
queen
herself
and
that
the
sight
of
her
shining
countenance
would
dazzle
his
eyes
then
all
at
once
he
thought
that
it
might
be
old
jacob
who
would
punish
him
for
running
away
he
opened
his
eyes
very
quickly
then
what
do
you
think
he
saw
an
ostrich
that
same
big
ostrich
he
had
seen
and
startled
early
in
the
day
it
was
standing
over
him
staring
down
with
its
great
vacant
eyes
gradually
its
head
came
lower
and
lower
down
until
at
last
it
made
a
sudden
peck
at
a
metal
button
on
his
jacket
and
gave
such
a
vigorous
tug
at
it
that
martin
was
almost
lifted
off
the
ground
he
screamed
and
gave
a
jump
but
it
was
nothing
to
the
jump
the
ostrich
gave
when
he
discovered
that
the
button
belonged
to
a
living
boy
he
jumped
six
feet
high
into
the
air
and
came
down
with
a
great
flop
then
feeling
rather
ashamed
of
himself
for
being
frightened
at
such
an
insignificant
thing
as
martin
he
stalked
majestically
away
glancing
back
first
over
one
shoulder
then
the
other
and
kicking
up
his
heels
behind
him
in
a
somewhat
disdainful
manner
martin
laughed
and
in
the
middle
of
his
laugh
he
fell
asleep
chapter
vi
martin
meets
with
savages
when
on
waking
next
morning
martin
took
his
first
peep
over
the
grass
there
directly
before
him
loomed
the
great
blue
hills
or
sierras
as
they
are
called
in
that
country
he
had
often
seen
them
long
ago
in
his
distant
home
on
clear
mornings
when
they
had
appeared
like
a
blue
cloud
on
the
horizon
he
had
even
wished
to
get
to
them
to
tread
their
beautiful
blue
summits
that
looked
as
if
they
would
be
soft
to
his
feet
softer
than
the
moist
springy
turf
on
the
plain
but
he
wished
it
only
as
one
wishes
to
get
to
some
impossible
place
a
white
cloud
for
instance
or
the
blue
sky
itself
now
all
at
once
he
unexpectedly
found
himself
near
them
and
the
sight
fired
him
with
a
new
desire
the
level
plain
had
nothing
half
so
enchanting
as
the
blue
airy
hills
and
very
soon
he
was
up
on
his
feet
and
hurrying
towards
them
in
spite
of
hurrying
he
did
not
seem
to
get
any
nearer
still
it
was
pleasant
to
be
always
going
on
and
on
knowing
that
he
would
get
to
them
at
last
he
had
now
left
the
drier
plains
behind
the
earth
was
clothed
with
green
and
yellow
grass
easy
to
the
feet
and
during
the
day
he
found
many
sweet
roots
to
refresh
him
he
also
found
quantities
of
a
round
fruit
a
little
less
than
a
cherry
in
size
bright
yellow
in
colour
and
each
berry
inside
a
green
case
or
sheath
shaped
like
a
heart
they
were
very
sweet
at
night
he
slept
once
more
in
the
long
grass
and
when
daylight
returned
he
travelled
on
feeling
very
happy
there
alone
happy
to
think
that
he
would
get
to
the
beautiful
hills
at
last
but
only
in
the
early
morning
would
they
look
distinct
and
near
later
in
the
day
when
the
sun
grew
hot
they
would
seem
further
off
like
a
cloud
resting
on
the
earth
which
made
him
think
sometimes
that
they
moved
on
as
he
went
towards
them
on
the
third
day
he
came
to
a
high
piece
of
ground
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
and
looked
over
to
the
other
side
he
saw
a
broad
green
valley
with
a
stream
of
water
running
in
it
on
one
hand
the
valley
with
its
gleaming
water
stretched
away
as
far
as
he
could
see
or
until
it
lost
itself
in
the
distant
haze
but
on
the
other
hand
on
looking
up
the
valley
there
appeared
a
great
forest
looking
blue
in
the
distance
and
this
was
the
first
forest
martin
had
ever
seen
close
by
down
in
the
green
valley
before
him
there
was
something
else
to
attract
his
attention
and
this
was
a
large
group
of
men
and
horses
no
sooner
had
he
caught
sight
of
them
than
he
set
off
at
a
run
towards
them
greatly
excited
and
as
he
drew
near
they
all
rose
up
from
the
grass
where
they
had
been
sitting
or
lying
to
stare
at
him
filled
with
wonder
at
the
sight
of
that
small
boy
alone
in
the
desert
there
were
about
twenty
men
and
women
and
several
children
the
men
were
very
big
and
tall
and
were
dressed
only
in
robes
made
of
the
skins
of
some
wild
animal
they
had
broad
flat
faces
and
dark
skins
and
their
long
black
hair
hung
down
loose
on
their
backs
these
strange
people
were
savages
and
are
supposed
to
be
cruel
and
wicked
and
to
take
pleasure
in
torturing
and
killing
any
lost
or
stray
person
that
falls
into
their
hands
but
indeed
it
is
not
so
as
you
shall
shortly
find
poor
ignorant
little
martin
who
had
never
read
a
book
in
his
life
having
always
refused
to
learn
his
letters
knew
nothing
about
savages
and
feared
them
no
more
than
he
had
feared
old
jacob
or
the
small
spotted
snake
the
very
sight
of
which
had
made
people
scream
and
run
away
so
he
marched
boldly
up
and
stared
at
them
and
they
in
turn
stared
at
him
out
of
their
great
dark
savage
eyes
illustration
they
had
just
been
eating
their
supper
of
deer
flesh
roasted
on
the
coals
and
after
a
time
one
of
the
savages
as
an
experiment
took
up
a
bone
of
meat
and
offered
it
to
him
being
very
hungry
he
gladly
took
it
and
began
gnawing
the
meat
off
the
bone
when
he
had
satisfied
his
hunger
he
began
to
look
round
him
still
stared
at
by
the
others
then
one
of
the
women
who
had
a
face
caught
him
up
and
seating
him
on
her
knees
tried
to
talk
to
him
quiltahou
papa
shani
cha
silmata
she
spoke
gazing
very
earnestly
into
his
face
they
had
all
been
talking
among
themselves
while
he
was
eating
but
he
did
not
know
that
savages
had
a
language
of
their
own
different
from
ours
and
so
thought
that
they
had
only
been
amusing
themselves
with
a
kind
of
nonsense
talk
which
meant
nothing
now
when
the
woman
addressed
this
funny
kind
of
talk
to
him
he
answered
her
in
her
own
way
as
he
imagined
readily
enough
hey
the
cat
in
the
fiddle
fe

with
bings
on
her
ringers
and
tells
on
her
boes
they
all
listened
with
grave
attention
as
if
he
had
said
something
very
important
then
the
woman
continued
huanatopa
ana

to
which
martin
answered

sifted
a
sieve
of
unsifted
thistles
and
if
theophilus
oh

say
any
more
then
she
said

martin
getting

impatient

daw

you
listen
to

and
now
let
me
go
but
she
held
him
fast
and
kept
on
talking
her
nonsense
language
to
him
until
becoming
vexed
he
caught
hold
of
her
hair
and
pulled
it
she
only
laughed
and
tossed
him
up
into
the
air
and
caught
him
again
just
as
he
might
have
tossed
and
caught
a
small
kitten
at
length
she
released
him
for
now
they
were
all
beginning
to
lie
down
by
the
fire
to
sleep
as
it
was
getting
dark
martin
being
very
tired
settled
himself
down
among
them
and
as
one
of
the
women
threw
a
skin
over
him
he
slept
very
comfortably
next
morning
the
hills
looked
nearer
than
ever
just
across
the
river
but
little
he
cared
for
hills
now
and
when
the
little
savage
children
went
out
to
hunt
for
berries
and
sweet
roots
he
followed
and
spent
the
day
agreeably
enough
in
their
company
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
his
new
playfellows
all
threw
off
their
little
skin
cloaks
and
plunged
into
the
stream
to
bathe
and
martin
seeing
how
much
they
seemed
to
enjoy
being
in
the
water
undressed
himself
and
went
in
after
them
the
water
was
not
too
deep
in
that
place
and
as
it
was
rare
fun
splashing
about
and
trying
to
keep
his
legs
in
the
swift
current
and
clambering
over
slippery
rocks
he
went
out
some
distance
from
the
bank
all
at
once
he
discovered
that
the
others
had
left
him
and
looking
back
he
saw
that
they
were
all
scrambling
out
on
to
the
bank
and
fighting
over
his
clothes
back
he
dashed
in
haste
to
rescue
his
property
but
by
the
time
he
reached
the
spot
they
had
finished
dividing
the
spoil
and
jumping
up
they
ran
away
and
scattered
in
all
directions
one
wearing
his
jacket
another
his
knickerbockers
another
his
shirt
and
one
sock
another
his
cap
and
shoes
and
the
last
the
one
remaining
sock
only
in
vain
he
pursued
and
called
after
them
and
at
last
he
was
compelled
to
follow
them
unclothed
to
the
camping
ground
where
he
presented
himself
crying
piteously
but
the
women
who
had
been
so
kind
to
him
would
not
help
him
now
and
only
laughed
to
see
how
white
his
skin
looked
by
contrast
with
the
dark
skins
of
the
other
children
at
length
one
of
them
compassionately
gave
him
a
small
skin
of
some
wild
animal
and
fastened
it
on
him
like
a
cloak
and
this
he
was
compelled
to
wear
with
shame
and
grief
feeling
very
strange
and
uncomfortable
in
it
but
the
feeling
of
discomfort
in
that
new
savage
dress
was
nothing
to
the
sense
of
injury
that
stung
him
and
in
his
secret
heart
he
was
determined
not
to
lose
his
own
clothes
when
the
children
went
out
next
day
he
followed
them
watching
and
waiting
for
a
chance
to
recover
anything
that
belonged
to
him
and
at
last
seeing
the
little
boy
who
wore
his
cap
off
his
guard
he
made
a
sudden
rush
and
snatching
it
off
the
young
savage
head
put
it
firmly
upon
his
own
but
the
little
savage
now
regarded
that
cap
as
his
very
own
he
had
taken
it
by
force
or
stratagem
and
had
worn
it
on
his
head
since
the
day
before
and
that
made
it
his
property
and
so
at
martin
he
went
and
they
fought
stoutly
together
and
being
nearly
of
a
size
he
could
not
conquer
the
little
white
boy
then
he
cried
out
to
the
others
to
help
him
and
they
came
and
overthrew
martin
and
deprived
him
not
only
of
his
cap
but
of
his
little
skin
cloak
as
well
and
then
punished
him
until
he
screamed
aloud
with
pain
leaving
him
crying
on
the
ground
they
ran
back
to
the
camp
he
followed
shortly
afterwards
but
got
no
sympathy
for
as
a
rule
savages
do
not
trouble
themselves
very
much
about
these
little
matters
they
leave
their
children
to
settle
their
own
disputes
during
the
rest
of
that
day
martin
sulked
by
himself
behind
a
great
tussock
of
grass
refusing
to
eat
with
the
others
and
when
one
of
the
women
went
to
him
and
offered
him
a
piece
of
meat
he
struck
it
vindictively
out
of
her
hand
she
only
laughed
a
little
and
left
him
now
when
the
sun
was
setting
and
he
was
beginning
to
feel
very
cold
and
miserable
in
his
nakedness
the
men
were
seen
returning
from
the
hunt
but
instead
of
riding
slowly
to
the
camp
as
on
other
days
they
came
riding
furiously
and
shouting
the
moment
they
were
seen
and
their
shouts
heard
the
women
jumped
up
and
began
hastily
packing
the
skins
and
all
their
belongings
into
bundles
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
whole
company
was
mounted
on
horseback
and
ready
for
flight
one
of
the
men
picked
martin
up
and
placed
him
on
the
horse
back
before
him
and
then
they
all
started
at
a
swift
canter
up
the
valley
towards
that
great
blue
forest
in
the
distance
in
about
an
hour
they
came
to
it
it
was
then
quite
dark
the
sky
powdered
with
numberless
stars
but
when
they
got
among
the
trees
the
blue
dusky
sky
and
brilliant
stars
disappeared
from
sight
as
if
a
black
cloud
had
come
over
them
so
dark
was
it
in
the
forest
for
the
trees
were
very
tall
and
mingled
their
branches
overhead
but
they
had
got
into
a
narrow
path
known
to
them
and
moving
slowly
in
single
file
they
kept
on
for
about
two
hours
longer
then
stopped
and
dismounted
under
the
great
trees
and
lying
down
all
close
together
went
to
sleep
martin
lying
among
them
crept
under
the
edge
of
one
of
the
large
skin
robes
and
feeling
warm
he
soon
fell
fast
asleep
and
did
not
wake
till
daylight

alone
in
the
great
forest
imagine
to
yourself
one
accustomed
to
live
in
the
great
treeless
plain
accustomed
to
open
his
eyes
each
morning
to
the
wide
blue
sky
and
the
brilliant
sunlight
now
for
the
first
time
opening
them
in
that
vast
gloomy
forest
where
neither
wind
nor
sunlight
came
and
no
sound
was
heard
and
twilight
lasted
all
day
long
all
round
him
were
trees
with
straight
tall
grey
trunks
and
behind
and
beyond
them
yet
other
trees
trees
everywhere
that
stood
motionless
like
pillars
of
stone
supporting
the
dim
green
roof
of
foliage
far
above
it
was
like
a
vast
gloomy
prison
in
which
he
had
been
shut
and
he
longed
to
make
his
escape
to
where
he
could
see
the
rising
sun
and
feel
the
fanning
wind
on
his
cheeks
he
looked
round
at
the
others
they
were
all
stretched
on
the
ground
still
in
a
deep
sleep
and
it
frightened
him
a
little
to
look
at
their
great
broad
dark
faces
framed
in
masses
of
black
hair
he
felt
that
he
hated
them
for
they
had
treated
him
badly
the
children
had
taken
his
clothes
compelling
him
to
go
naked
and
had
beaten
and
bruised
him
and
he
had
not
been
pitied
and
helped
by
their
elders
by
and
by
very
quietly
and
cautiously
he
crept
away
from
among
them
and
made
his
escape
into
the
gloomy
wood
on
one
side
the
forest
shadows
looked
less
dark
than
the
other
and
on
that
side
he
went
for
it
was
the
side
on
which
the
sun
rose
and
the
direction
he
had
been
travelling
when
he
first
met
with
the
savages
on
and
on
he
went
over
the
thick
bed
of
dark
decaying
leaves
which
made
no
rustling
sound
looking
like
a
little
white
ghost
of
a
boy
in
that
great
gloomy
wood
but
he
came
to
no
open
place
nor
did
he
find
anything
to
eat
when
hunger
pressed
him
for
there
were
no
sweet
roots
and
berries
there
nor
any
plant
that
he
had
ever
seen
before
it
was
all
strange
and
gloomy
and
very
silent
not
a
leaf
trembled
for
if
one
had
trembled
near
him
he
would
have
heard
it
whisper
in
that
profound
stillness
that
made
him
hold
his
breath
to
listen
but
sometimes
at
long
intervals
the
silence
would
be
broken
by
a
sound
that
made
him
start
and
stand
still
and
wonder
what
had
caused
it
for
the
rare
sounds
in
the
forest
were
unlike
any
sounds
he
had
heard
before
three
or
four
times
during
the
day
a
burst
of
loud
hollow
confused
laughter
sounded
high
up
among
the
trees
but
he
saw
nothing
although
most
likely
the
creature
that
had
laughed
saw
him
plainly
enough
from
its
in
the
deep
shadows
as
it
ran
up
the
trunks
of
the
trees
illustration
at
length
he
came
to
a
river
about
thirty
or
forty
yards
wide
and
this
was
the
same
river
that
he
had
bathed
in
many
leagues
further
down
in
the
open
valley
it
is
called
by
the
savages
which
means
that
it
runs
partly
in
the
dark
and
partly
in
the
light
here
it
was
in
the
dark
the
trees
grew
thick
and
tall
on
its
banks
and
their
wide
branches
met
and
intermingled
above
its
waters
that
flowed
on
without
a
ripple
black
to
the
eye
as
a
river
of
ink
how
strange
it
seemed
when
holding
on
to
a
twig
he
bent
over
and
saw
himself
reflected
a
white
naked
child
with
a
scared
face
in
that
black
mirror
overcome
by
thirst
he
ventured
to
creep
down
and
dip
his
hand
in
the
stream
and
was
astonished
to
see
that
the
black
water
looked
as
clear
as
crystal
in
his
hollow
hand
after
quenching
his
thirst
he
went
on
following
the
river
now
for
it
had
made
him
turn
aside
but
after
walking
for
an
hour
or
more
he
came
to
a
great
tree
that
had
fallen
across
the
stream
and
climbing
on
to
the
slippery
trunk
he
crept
cautiously
over
and
then
went
gladly
on
in
the
old
direction
now
after
he
had
crossed
the
river
and
walked
a
long
distance
he
came
to
a
more
open
part
but
though
it
was
nice
to
feel
the
sunshine
on
him
again
the
underwood
and
grass
and
creepers
trailing
over
the
ground
made
it
difficult
and
tiring
to
walk
and
in
this
place
a
curious
thing
happened
picking
his
way
through
the
tangled
herbage
an
animal
his
footsteps
had
startled
scuttled
away
in
great
fear
and
as
it
went
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
it
was
a
kind
of
weasel
but
very
large
larger
than
a
big
and
all
over
as
black
as
the
blackest
cat
looking
down
he
discovered
that
this
strange
animal
had
been
feasting
on
eggs
the
eggs
were
nearly
as
large
as
fowls
of
a
deep
green
colour
with
polished
shells
there
had
been
about
a
dozen
in
the
nest
which
was
only
a
small
hollow
in
the
ground
lined
with
dry
grass
but
most
of
them
had
been
broken
and
the
contents
devoured
by
the
weasel
only
two
remained
entire
and
these
he
took
and
tempted
by
his
hunger
soon
broke
the
shells
at
the
small
end
and
sucked
them
clean
they
were
raw
but
never
had
eggs
boiled
fried
or
poached
tasted
so
nice
before
he
had
just
finished
his
meal
and
was
wishing
that
a
third
egg
had
remained
in
the
ruined
nest
when
a
slight
sound
like
the
buzzing
of
an
insect
made
him
look
round
and
there
within
a
few
feet
of
him
was
the
big
black
weasel
once
more
looking
strangely
bold
and
it
kept
staring
fixedly
at
martin
out
of
its
small
wicked
beady
black
eyes
and
snarling
so
as
to
show
its
white
sharp
teeth
and
very
white
they
looked
by
contrast
with
the
black
lips
and
nose
and
hair
martin
stared
back
at
it
but
it
kept
moving
and
coming
nearer
now
sitting
straight
up
then
dropping
its
and
gathering
its
legs
in
a
bunch
as
if
about
to
spring
and
finally
stretching
itself
straight
out
towards
him
again
its
round
flat
head
and
long
smooth
body
making
it
look
like
a
great
black
snake
crawling
towards
him
and
all
the
time
it
kept
on
snarling
and
clicking
its
sharp
teeth
and
uttering
its
low
buzzing
growl
martin
grew
more
and
more
afraid
it
looked
so
strong
and
angry
so
unspeakably
fierce
the
creature
looked
as
if
he
was
speaking
to
martin
saying
something
very
easy
to
understand
and
very
dreadful
to
hear
this
is
what
it
seemed
to
be
saying
ha
you
came
on
me
unawares
and
startled
me
away
from
the
nest
i
found
you
have
eaten
the
last
two
eggs
and
i
found
them
and
they
were
mine
must
i
go
hungry
for
you
starveling
robber
a
miserable
little
boy
alone
and
lost
in
the
forest
naked
all
scratched
and
bleeding
with
thorns
with
no
courage
in
his
heart
no
strength
in
his
hands
look
at
me
i
am
not
weak
but
strong
and
black
and
fierce
i
live
here
this
is
my
home
i
fear
nothing
i
am
like
a
serpent
and
like
brass
and
tempered
steel
nothing
can
bruise
or
break
me
my
teeth
are
like
fine
daggers
when
i
strike
them
into
the
flesh
of
any
creature
i
never
loose
my
hold
till
i
have
sucked
out
all
the
blood
in
his
heart
but
you
weak
little
wretch
i
hate
you
i
thirst
for
your
blood
for
stealing
my
food
from
me
what
can
you
do
to
save
yourself
down
down
on
the
ground
where
i
can
get
hold
of
you
you
shall
pay
me
for
the
eggs
with
your
life
i
shall
hold
you
fast
by
the
throat
and
drink
and
drink
until
i
see
your
glassy
eyes
close
and
your
cheeks
turn
whiter
than
ashes
and
i
feel
your
heart
flutter
like
a
leaf
in
your
bosom
down
down
it
was
terrible
to
watch
him
and
seem
to
hear
such
words
he
was
nearer
now
scarcely
a
yard
away
still
with
his
beady
glaring
eyes
fixed
on
martin
face
and
martin
was
powerless
to
fly
from
him
powerless
even
to
stir
a
step
or
to
lift
a
hand
his
heart
jumped
so
that
it
choked
him
his
hair
stood
up
on
his
head
and
he
trembled
so
that
he
was
ready
to
fall
and
at
last
when
about
to
fall
to
the
ground
in
the
extremity
of
his
terror
he
uttered
a
great
scream
of
despair
and
the
sudden
scream
so
startled
the
weasel
that
he
jumped
up
and
scuttled
away
as
fast
as
he
could
through
the
creepers
and
bushes
making
a
great
rustling
over
the
dead
leaves
and
twigs
and
martin
recovering
his
strength
listened
to
that
retreating
sound
as
it
passed
away
into
the
deep
shadows
until
it
ceased
altogether
chapter
viii
the
flower
and
the
serpent
his
escape
from
the
horrible
black
animal
made
martin
quite
happy
in
spite
of
hunger
and
fatigue
and
he
pushed
on
as
bravely
as
ever
but
it
was
slow
going
and
very
difficult
even
painful
in
places
on
account
of
the
rough
thorny
undergrowth
where
he
had
to
push
and
crawl
through
the
close
bushes
and
tread
on
ground
littered
with
old
dead
prickly
leaves
and
dead
thorny
twigs
after
going
on
for
about
an
hour
in
this
way
he
came
to
a
stream
a
branch
of
the
river
he
had
left
and
much
shallower
so
that
he
could
easily
cross
from
side
to
side
and
he
could
also
see
the
bright
pebbles
under
the
clear
swift
current
the
stream
appeared
to
run
from
the
east
the
way
he
wished
to
travel
towards
the
hills
so
that
he
could
keep
by
it
which
he
wras
glad
enough
to
do
as
it
was
nice
to
get
a
drink
of
water
whenever
he
felt
thirsty
and
to
refresh
his
tired
and
sore
little
feet
in
the
stream
following
this
water
he
came
before
very
long
to
a
place
in
the
forest
where
there
was
little
or
no
underwood
but
only
low
trees
and
bushes
scattered
about
and
all
the
ground
moist
and
very
green
and
fresh
like
a
it
was
indeed
pleasant
to
feel
his
feet
on
the
soft
carpet
of
grass
and
stooping
he
put
his
hands
down
on
it
and
finally
lying
down
he
rolled
on
it
so
as
to
have
the
nice
sensation
of
the
warm
soft
grass
all
over
his
body
so
agreeable
was
it
lying
and
rolling
about
in
that
open
green
place
with
the
sweet
sunshine
on
him
that
he
felt
no
inclination
to
get
up
and
travel
on
it
was
so
sweet
to
rest
after
all
his
strivings
and
sufferings
in
that
great
dark
forest
so
sweet
was
it
that
he
pretty
soon
fell
asleep
and
no
doubt
slept
a
long
time
for
when
he
woke
the
sun
which
had
been
over
his
head
was
now
far
down
in
the
west
it
was
very
still
and
the
air
warm
and
fragrant
at
that
hour
with
the
sun
shining
through
the
higher
branches
of
the
trees
on
the
green
turf
where
he
was
lying
how
green
it
was
the
grass
the
trees
every
tiny
blade
and
every
leaf
was
like
a
piece
of
emerald
green
glass
with
the
sun
shining
through
it
so
wonderful
did
it
seem
to
him
the
intense
greenness
the
brilliant
sunbeams
that
shone
into
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
fill
him
with
brightness
and
the
stillness
of
the
forest
that
he
sat
up
and
stared
about
him
what
did
it
mean
that
brightness
and
stillness
then
at
a
little
distance
away
he
caught
sight
of
something
on
a
tree
of
a
shining
golden
yellow
colour
jumping
up
he
ran
to
the
tree
and
found
that
it
was
half
overgrown
with
a
very
beautiful
climbing
plant
with
leaves
divided
like
the
fingers
of
a
hand
and
large
flowers
and
fruit
both
green
and
ripe
the
ripe
fruit
was
as
big
as
a
duck
egg
and
the
same
shape
and
of
a
shining
yellow
colour
reaching
up
his
hand
he
began
to
feel
the
smooth
lovely
fruit
when
being
very
ripe
it
came
off
its
stem
into
his
hand
it
smelt
very
nice
and
then
in
his
hunger
he
bit
through
the
smooth
rind
with
his
teeth
and
it
tasted
as
nice
as
it
looked
he
quickly
ate
it
and
then
pulled
another
and
ate
that
and
then
another
and
still
others
until
he
could
eat
no
more
he
had
not
had
so
delicious
a
meal
for
many
a
long
day
not
until
he
had
eaten
his
fill
did
martin
begin
to
look
closely
at
the
flowers
on
the
plant
it
was
the
and
he
had
never
seen
it
before
and
now
that
he
looked
well
at
it
he
thought
it
the
loveliest
and
strangest
flower
he
had
ever
beheld
not
brilliant
and
shining
in
the
sun
like
the
scarlet
verbena
of
the
plains
or
some
yellow
flower
but
pale
and
misty
the
petals
being
of
a
dim
greenish
with
a
large
blue
circle
in
the
centre
and
the
blue
too
was
misty
like
the
blue
haze
in
the
distance
on
a
summer
day
to
see
and
admire
it
better
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
tried
to
pluck
one
of
the
flowers
then
in
an
instant
he
dropped
his
hand
as
if
he
had
been
pricked
by
a
thorn
but
there
was
no
thorn
and
nothing
to
hurt
him
he
dropped
his
hand
only
because
he
felt
that
he
had
hurt
the
flower
moving
a
step
back
he
stared
at
it
and
the
flower
seemed
like
a
thing
alive
that
looked
back
at
him
and
asked
him
why
he
had
hurt
it
o
poor
flower
said
martin
and
coming
closer
he
touched
it
gently
with
his
and
then
standing
on
tiptoe
he
touched
its
petals
with
his
lips
just
as
his
mother
had
often
and
often
kissed
his
little
hand
when
he
had
bruised
it
or
pricked
it
with
a
thorn
then
while
still
standing
by
the
plant
on
bringing
his
eyes
down
to
the
ground
he
spied
a
great
snake
lying
coiled
up
on
a
bed
of
moss
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
same
tree
where
the
plant
was
growing
he
remembered
the
dear
little
snake
he
had
once
made
a
friend
of
and
he
did
not
feel
afraid
for
he
thought
that
all
snakes
must
be
friendly
towards
him
although
this
was
a
very
big
one
thicker
than
his
arm
and
of
a
different
colour
it
was
a
pale
like
the
moss
it
was
lying
on
with
a
pattern
of
black
and
brown
mottling
along
its
back
it
was
lying
coiled
round
and
round
with
its
flat
head
resting
on
its
coils
and
its
round
bright
eyes
fixed
on
martin
face
the
sun
shining
on
its
eyes
made
them
glint
like
polished
jewels
or
pieces
of
glass
and
when
martin
moved
nearer
and
stood
still
or
when
he
drew
back
and
went
to
this
side
or
that
those
brilliant
glinting
eyes
were
still
on
his
face
and
it
began
to
trouble
him
until
at
last
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
then
he
opened
his
fingers
enough
to
peep
through
them
and
still
those
glittering
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
illustration
martin
wondered
if
the
snake
was
vexed
with
him
for
coming
there
and
why
it
watched
him
so
steadily
with
those
shining
eyes
will
you
please
look
some
other
way
he
said
at
last
but
the
snake
would
not
and
so
he
turned
from
it
and
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
everything
was
alive
and
watching
him
in
the
same
intent
way
the
the
green
leaves
the
grass
the
trees
the
wide
sky
the
great
shining
sun
he
listened
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
wood
not
even
the
hum
of
a
fly
or
wild
bee
and
it
was
so
still
that
not
a
leaf
moved
finally
he
moved
away
from
that
spot
but
treading
very
softly
and
holding
his
breath
to
listen
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
forest
had
something
to
tell
him
and
that
if
he
listened
he
would
hear
the
leaves
speaking
to
him
and
he
did
hear
a
sound
it
came
from
a
spot
about
a
hundred
yards
away
and
was
like
the
sound
of
a
person
crying
then
came
low
sobs
which
rose
and
fell
and
then
ceased
and
after
a
silent
interval
began
again
perhaps
it
was
a
child
lost
there
in
the
forest
like
himself
going
softly
to
the
spot
he
discovered
that
the
sobbing
sounds
came
from
the
other
side
of
a
low
tree
with
widespread
branches
a
kind
of
acacia
with
thin
loose
foliage
but
he
could
not
see
through
it
and
so
he
went
round
the
tree
to
look
and
startled
a
dove
which
flew
off
with
a
loud
clatter
of
its
wings
when
the
dove
had
flown
away
it
was
again
very
silent
what
was
he
to
do
he
was
too
tired
now
to
walk
much
farther
and
the
sun
was
getting
low
so
that
all
the
ground
was
in
shadow
he
went
on
a
little
way
looking
for
some
nice
shelter
where
he
could
pass
the
night
but
could
not
find
one
at
length
when
the
sun
had
set
and
the
dark
was
coming
he
came
upon
an
old
tree
where
there
was
a
hollow
at
the
roots
lined
with
half
dry
moss
very
soft
to
his
foot
and
it
seemed
a
nice
place
to
sleep
in
but
he
had
no
choice
for
he
was
afraid
of
going
further
in
the
dark
among
the
trees
and
so
creeping
into
the
hollow
among
the
old
roots
he
curled
himself
up
as
comfortably
as
he
could
and
soon
began
to
get
very
drowsy
in
spite
of
having
no
covering
to
keep
him
warm
but
although
very
tired
and
sleepy
he
did
not
go
quite
to
sleep
for
he
had
never
been
all
alone
in
a
wood
by
night
before
and
it
was
different
from
the
open
plain
where
he
could
see
all
round
even
at
night
and
where
he
had
feared
nothing
here
the
trees
looked
strange
and
made
strange
black
shadows
and
he
thought
that
the
strange
people
of
the
wood
were
perhaps
now
roaming
about
and
would
find
him
there
he
did
not
want
them
to
find
him
fast
asleep
it
was
better
to
be
awake
so
that
when
they
came
he
could
jump
up
and
run
away
and
hide
himself
from
them
once
or
twice
a
slight
rustling
sound
made
him
start
and
think
that
at
last
some
one
was
coming
to
him
stealing
softly
so
as
to
catch
him
unawares
but
he
could
see
nothing
moving
and
when
he
held
his
breath
to
listen
there
was
no
sound
illustration
then
all
at
once
just
when
he
had
almost
dropped
off
a
great
cry
sounded
at
a
distance
and
made
him
start
up
wide
awake
again
o
look
look
look
cried
the
voice
in
a
tone
so
deep
and
strange
and
powerful
that
no
one
could
have
heard
it
without
terror
for
it
seemed
to
be
uttered
by
some
forest
monster
twenty
times
bigger
than
an
ordinary
man
in
a
moment
an
answer
came
from
another
part
of
the
wood
what
that
cried
the
answering
voice
and
then
another
voice
cried
and
then
others
far
and
near
all
shouting
what
that
and
for
only
answer
the
first
voice
shouted
once
more
o
look
look
look
poor
martin
trembling
with
fright
crouched
lower
down
in
his
mossy
bed
thinking
that
the
awful
people
of
the
forest
must
have
seen
him
and
would
be
upon
him
in
a
few
moments
but
though
he
stared
with
eyes
into
the
gloom
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
trees
standing
silent
and
motionless
and
no
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
could
he
hear
after
that
it
was
silent
again
for
a
while
and
he
began
to
hope
that
they
had
given
up
looking
for
him
when
suddenly
close
by
sounded
a
loud
startling
who
that
and
he
gave
himself
up
for
lost
for
he
was
too
terrified
to
jump
up
and
run
away
as
he
had
thought
to
do
he
could
only
lie
still
his
teeth
chattering
his
hair
standing
up
on
his
head
who
that
exclaimed
the
terrible
voice
once
more
and
then
he
saw
a
big
black
shape
drop
down
from
the
tree
above
and
settle
on
a
dead
branch
a
few
feet
above
his
it
was
a
bird
a
great
owl
for
now
he
could
see
it
sharply
outlined
against
the
clear
starry
sky
and
the
bird
had
seen
and
was
peering
curiously
at
him
and
now
all
his
fear
was
gone
for
he
could
not
be
afraid
of
an
owl
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
owls
all
his
life
only
they
were
small
and
this
owl
of
the
forest
was
as
big
as
an
eagle
and
had
a
round
head
and
ears
like
a
cat
and
great
eyes
that
shone
in
the
dark
the
owl
kept
staring
at
martin
for
some
time
swaying
his
body
this
way
and
that
and
lowering
then
raising
his
head
so
as
to
get
a
better
view
and
martin
on
his
side
stared
back
at
the
owl
and
at
last
he
exclaimed
o
what
a
great
big
owl
you
are
please
say
again
but
before
the
owl
said
anything
martin
was
fast
asleep
in
his
mossy
bed
chapter
ix
the
black
people
of
the
sky
whether
or
not
the
great
owl
went
on
shouting
look
look
and
asking
and
all
night
martin
did
not
know
he
was
fast
asleep
until
the
morning
sun
shone
on
his
face
and
woke
him
and
as
he
had
no
clothes
and
shoes
to
put
on
he
was
soon
up
and
out
first
he
took
a
drink
of
water
then
feeling
very
hungry
he
went
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
found
the
ripe
fruit
and
made
a
very
good
breakfast
after
that
he
set
out
once
more
through
the
wood
towards
sunrise
still
following
the
stream
before
long
the
wood
became
still
more
open
and
at
last
to
his
great
joy
he
found
that
he
had
got
clear
of
it
and
was
once
more
on
the
great
open
plain
and
now
the
hills
were
once
more
in
sight
those
great
blue
hills
where
he
wished
to
be
looking
nearer
and
larger
than
before
but
they
still
looked
blue
like
great
banks
of
cloud
and
were
a
long
distance
away
but
he
was
determined
to
get
to
them
to
climb
up
their
steep
sides
and
by
and
by
when
he
found
the
stream
bent
away
to
the
south
he
left
it
so
as
to
go
on
straight
as
he
could
to
the
hills
away
from
the
the
ground
was
higher
and
very
flat
and
covered
with
dry
yellow
grass
over
this
yellow
plain
he
walked
for
hours
resting
at
times
but
finding
no
water
and
no
sweet
roots
to
quench
his
thirst
until
he
was
too
tired
to
walk
any
further
and
so
he
sat
down
on
the
dry
grass
under
that
wide
blue
sky
there
was
not
a
cloud
on
it
nothing
but
the
great
globe
of
the
sun
above
him
and
there
was
no
wind
and
no
motion
in
the
yellow
grass
blades
and
no
sight
or
sound
of
any
living
creature
martin
lying
on
his
back
gazed
up
at
the
blue
sky
keeping
his
eyes
from
the
sun
which
was
too
bright
for
them
and
after
a
time
he
did
see
something
moving
a
small
black
spot
no
bigger
than
a
fly
moving
in
a
circle
but
he
knew
it
was
something
big
but
at
so
great
a
height
from
the
earth
as
to
look
like
a
fly
and
then
he
caught
sight
of
a
second
black
speck
then
another
and
another
until
he
could
make
out
a
dozen
or
twenty
or
more
all
moving
in
wide
circles
at
that
vast
height
martin
thought
they
must
be
the
black
people
of
the
sky
he
wondered
why
they
were
black
and
not
white
like
white
birds
or
blue
and
of
other
brilliant
colours
like
the
people
of
the
mirage
now
it
was
impossible
for
martin
to
lie
like
that
following
those
small
black
spots
on
the
hot
blue
sky
as
they
wheeled
round
and
round
continuously
without
giving
his
eyes
a
little
rest
by
shutting
them
at
intervals
he
kept
them
shut
a
little
too
long
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
woke
he
did
wake
fully
in
a
moment
he
remained
lying
motionless
just
as
before
with
eyes
still
closed
but
the
lids
just
raised
enough
to
enable
him
to
see
about
him
and
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
was
very
curious
he
was
no
longer
alone
in
that
solitary
place
there
were
people
all
round
him
dozens
and
scores
of
little
black
men
about
two
feet
in
height
of
a
very
singular
appearance
they
had
bald
heads
and
thin
hatchet
faces
wrinkled
and
warty
and
long
noses
and
they
all
wore
black
silk
clothes
coat
waistcoat
and
knickerbockers
but
without
shoes
and
stockings
their
thin
black
legs
and
feet
were
bare
nor
did
they
have
anything
on
their
bald
heads
they
were
gathered
round
martin
in
a
circle
but
a
very
wide
circle
quite
twenty
to
thirty
feet
away
from
him
and
some
were
walking
about
others
standing
alone
or
in
groups
talking
together
and
all
looking
at
martin
only
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
most
important
person
of
the
company
kept
inside
the
circle
and
whenever
one
or
more
of
the
others
came
forward
a
few
steps
he
held
up
his
hand
and
begged
them
to
go
back
a
little
we
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
he
said
we
must
wait
wait
for
what
asked
one
for
what
may
happen
said
the
important
one
i
must
ask
you
again
to
leave
it
to
me
to
decide
when
it
is
time
to
begin
then
he
strutted
up
and
down
in
the
open
space
turning
now
towards
his
fellows
and
again
to
martin
moving
his
head
about
to
get
a
better
sight
of
his
face
then
putting
his
hand
down
between
his
coat
and
waistcoat
he
drew
out
a
knife
with
a
long
shining
blade
and
holding
it
from
him
looked
attentively
at
it
by
and
by
he
breathed
gently
on
the
bright
blade
then
pulling
out
a
black
silk
pocket
handkerchief
wiped
off
the
stain
of
his
breath
and
turning
the
blade
about
made
it
glitter
in
the
sun
then
he
put
it
back
under
his
coat
and
resumed
his
walk
up
and
down
we
are
getting
very
hungry
said
one
of
the
others
at
length
very
hungry
indeed
cried
another
some
of
us
have
not
tasted
food
these
three
days
it
certainly
does
seem
hard
said
yet
another
to
see
our
dinner
before
us
and
not
be
allowed
to
touch
it
not
so
fast
my
friends
i
beg
exclaimed
the
man
with
the
knife
i
have
already
explained
the
case
and
i
do
think
you
are
a
little
unfair
in
pressing
me
as
you
do
thus
rebuked
they
consulted
together
then
one
of
them
spoke
if
sir
you
consider
us
unfair
or
that
we
have
not
full
confidence
in
you
would
it
not
be
as
well
to
get
some
other
person
to
take
your
place
yes
i
am
ready
to
do
that
returned
the
important
one
promptly
and
here
drawing
forth
the
knife
once
more
he
held
it
out
towards
them
but
instead
of
coming
forward
to
take
it
they
all
recoiled
some
steps
showing
considerable
alarm
and
then
they
all
began
protesting
that
they
were
not
complaining
of
him
that
they
were
satisfied
with
their
choice
and
could
not
have
put
the
matter
in
abler
hands
i
am
pleased
at
your
good
opinion
said
the
important
one
i
may
tell
you
that
i
am
no
chicken
i
first
saw
the
light
in
september
and
as
you
know
we
are
now
within
seven
months
and
thirteen
days
of
the
end
of
the
first
decade
of
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
you
may
infer
from
this
that
i
have
had
a
pretty
extensive
experience
and
i
promise
you
that
when
i
come
to
cut
the
body
up
you
will
not
be
able
to
say
that
i
have
made
an
unfair
distribution
or
that
any
one
has
been
left
without
his
portion
illustration
all
murmured
approval
and
then
one
of
the
company
asked
if
he
would
be
allowed
to
bespeak
the
liver
for
his
share
no
sir
certainly
not
replied
the
other
such
matters
must
be
left
to
my
discretion
entirely
and
i
must
also
remind
you
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
and
it
is
possible
that
in
this
instance
he
may
think
fit
to
retain
the
liver
for
his
own
consumption
after
thus
asserting
himself
he
began
to
examine
the
blade
of
his
knife
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
and
to
breathe
gently
on
it
and
wipe
it
with
his
handkerchief
to
make
it
shine
brighter
in
the
sun
finally
raising
his
arm
he
flourished
it
and
then
made
two
or
three
stabs
and
lunges
in
the
air
then
walking
on
tiptoe
he
adyanced
to
martin
lying
so
still
on
the
yellow
grass
in
the
midst
of
that
company
the
hot
sun
shining
on
his
naked
white
body
the
others
all
immediately
pressed
forward
craning
their
necks
and
looking
highly
excited
they
were
expecting
great
things
but
when
the
man
with
a
knife
had
got
quite
close
to
martin
he
was
seized
with
fear
and
made
two
or
three
long
jumps
back
to
where
the
others
were
and
then
recovering
from
his
alarm
he
quietly
put
back
the
knife
under
his
coat
we
really
thought
you
were
going
to
begin
said
one
of
the
crowd
oh
no
no
indeed
not
just
yet
said
the
other
it
is
very
disappointing
remarked
one
the
man
with
the
knife
turned
on
him
and
replied
with
dignity
i
am
really
surprised
at
such
a
remark
after
all
i
have
said
on
the
subject
i
do
wish
you
would
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
case
they
are
peculiar
for
this
person
this
martin
is
not
an
ordinary
person
we
have
been
keeping
our
eyes
on
him
for
some
time
past
and
have
witnessed
some
remarkable
actions
on
his
part
to
put
it
mildly
let
us
keep
in
mind
the
boldness
the
resource
the
dangerous
violence
he
has
displayed
on
so
many
occasions
since
he
took
to
his
present
vagabond
way
of
life
it
appears
to
me
said
one
of
the
others
that
if
martin
is
dead
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
about
his
character
and
desperate
deeds
in
the
past
he
is
dead
exclaimed
the
other
sharply
that
is
the
very
point
he
dead
can
you
confidently
say
that
he
is
not
in
a
sound
sleep
or
in
a
dead
faint
or
shamming
and
ready
at
the
first
touch
of
the
knife
to
leap
up
and
seize
his
assailant
i
mean
his
carver
by
the
throat
and
perhaps
murder
him
as
he
once
murdered
a
spoonbill
that
would
be
very
dreadful
said
one
but
surely
said
another
there
are
means
of
telling
whether
a
person
is
dead
or
not
one
simple
and
effectual
method
which
i
have
heard
is
to
place
a
hand
over
the
heart
to
feel
if
it
still
beats
yes
i
know
i
have
also
heard
of
that
plan
very
simple
as
you
say
but
who
is
to
try
it
i
invite
the
person
who
makes
the
suggestion
to
put
it
in
practice
with
pleasure
said
the
other
coming
forward
with
a
tripping
gait
and
an
air
of
not
being
in
the
least
afraid
but
on
coming
near
the
supposed
corpse
he
paused
to
look
round
at
the
others
then
pulling
out
his
black
silk
handkerchief
he
wiped
his
black
wrinkled
forehead
and
bald
head
whew
he
exclaimed
it
very
hot
i
do
find
it
so
said
the
man
with
the
knife
it
is
sometimes
a
matter
of
nerves
it
was
not
a
very
nice
remark
but
it
had
the
effect
of
bracing
the
other
up
and
moving
forward
a
little
more
he
began
anxiously
scrutinizing
martin
face
the
others
now
began
to
press
forward
but
were
warned
by
the
man
with
a
knife
not
to
come
too
near
then
the
bold
person
who
had
undertaken
to
feel
martin
heart
doubled
back
the
silk
sleeve
of
his
coat
and
after
some
further
preparation
extended
his
arm
and
made
two
or
three
preliminary
passes
with
his
trembling
hand
at
a
distance
of
a
foot
or
so
from
the
breast
of
the
corpse
then
he
approached
it
a
little
nearer
but
before
it
came
to
the
touching
point
a
sudden
fear
made
him
start
back
what
is
it
what
did
you
see
cried
the
others
i
not
sure
there
was
a
twitch
of
the
eyelid
he
replied
never
mind
the
eyelid
feel
his
heart
said
one
that
all
very
well
he
returned
but
how
would
you
like
it
yourself
will
come
and
do
it
no
no
they
all
cried
you
have
undertaken
this
and
must
go
through
with
it
thus
encouraged
he
once
more
turned
to
the
corpse
and
again
anxiously
began
to
examine
the
face
now
martin
had
been
watching
them
through
the
slits
of
his
not
quite
closed
eyes
all
the
time
and
listening
to
their
talk
being
hungry
himself
he
could
not
help
feeling
for
them
and
not
thinking
that
it
would
hurt
him
to
be
cut
up
in
pieces
and
devoured
he
had
begun
to
wish
that
they
would
really
begin
on
him
he
was
both
amused
and
annoyed
at
their
nervousness
and
at
last
opening
wide
his
eyes
very
suddenly
he
cried
feel
my
heart
it
was
as
if
a
gun
had
been
fired
among
them
for
a
moment
they
were
struck
still
with
terror
and
then
all
together
turned
and
fled
going
away
with
three
very
long
hops
and
then
opening
wide
their
great
wings
they
launched
themselves
on
the
air
for
they
were
not
little
black
men
in
black
silk
clothes
as
it
had
seemed
but
vultures
those
great
birds
which
he
had
watched
circling
in
the
sky
looking
no
bigger
than
bees
or
flies
at
that
vast
distance
above
the
earth
and
when
he
was
watching
them
they
were
watching
him
and
after
he
had
fallen
asleep
they
continued
moving
round
and
round
in
the
sky
for
hours
and
seeing
him
lying
so
still
on
the
plain
they
at
last
imagined
that
he
was
dead
and
one
by
one
they
closed
or
their
wings
and
dropped
gliding
downwards
growing
larger
in
appearance
as
they
neared
the
ground
until
the
small
black
spots
no
bigger
than
flies
were
seen
to
be
great
black
birds
as
big
as
turkeys
but
you
see
martin
was
not
dead
after
all
and
so
they
had
to
go
away
without
their
dinner
chapter
x
a
troop
of
wild
horses
it
seemed
so
lonely
to
martin
when
the
vultures
had
gone
up
out
of
sight
in
the
sky
so
silent
and
solitary
on
that
immense
level
plain
that
he
could
not
help
wishing
them
back
for
the
sake
of
company
they
were
an
amusing
people
when
they
were
walking
round
him
conversing
together
and
trying
without
coming
too
near
to
discover
whether
he
was
dead
or
only
sleeping
all
that
day
it
was
just
as
lonely
for
though
he
went
on
as
far
as
he
could
before
night
he
was
still
on
that
great
level
plain
of
dry
yellow
grass
which
appeared
to
have
no
end
and
the
blue
hills
looked
no
nearer
than
when
he
had
started
in
the
morning
he
was
hungry
and
thirsty
that
evening
and
very
cold
too
when
he
nestled
down
on
the
ground
with
nothing
to
cover
him
but
the
little
heap
of
dry
grass
he
had
gathered
for
his
bed
it
was
better
next
day
for
after
walking
two
or
three
hours
he
came
to
the
end
of
that
yellow
plain
to
higher
ground
where
the
earth
was
sandy
and
barren
with
a
few
scattered
bushes
growing
on
it
dark
prickly
bushes
like
butcher
broom
when
he
got
to
the
highest
part
of
this
barren
ground
he
saw
a
green
valley
beyond
stretching
away
as
far
as
he
could
see
on
either
hand
but
it
was
nice
to
see
a
green
place
again
and
going
down
into
the
valley
he
managed
to
find
some
sweet
roots
to
stay
his
hunger
and
thirst
then
after
a
rest
he
went
on
again
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
high
ground
beyond
the
valley
he
saw
another
valley
before
him
just
like
the
one
he
had
left
behind
again
he
rested
in
that
green
place
and
then
slowly
went
up
the
high
land
beyond
where
it
was
barren
and
sandy
with
the
dark
stiff
prickly
bushes
growing
here
and
there
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
he
looked
down
and
behold
there
was
yet
another
green
valley
stretching
away
to
the
right
and
left
as
far
as
he
could
see
would
they
never
end
these
high
barren
ridges
and
the
long
green
valleys
between
when
he
toiled
slowly
up
out
of
this
last
green
it
was
growing
late
in
the
day
and
he
was
very
tired
then
he
came
to
the
top
of
another
ridge
like
the
others
only
higher
and
more
barren
and
when
he
could
see
the
country
beyond
lo
another
valley
greener
and
broader
than
those
he
had
left
behind
and
a
river
flowing
in
it
looking
like
a
band
of
silver
lying
along
the
green
earth
a
river
too
broad
for
him
to
cross
stretching
away
north
and
south
as
far
as
he
could
see
how
then
should
he
ever
be
able
to
get
to
the
hills
still
far
far
away
beyond
that
water
martin
stared
at
the
scene
before
him
for
some
time
then
feeling
very
tired
and
weak
he
sat
down
on
the
sandy
ground
beside
a
scanty
dark
bush
tears
came
to
his
eyes
he
felt
them
running
down
his
cheeks
and
all
at
once
he
remembered
how
long
before
when
his
wandering
began
he
had
dropped
a
tear
and
a
small
dusty
beetle
had
refreshed
himself
by
drinking
it
he
bent
down
and
let
a
tear
drop
and
watched
it
as
it
sank
into
the
ground
but
no
small
beetle
came
out
to
drink
it
and
he
felt
more
lonely
and
miserable
than
ever
he
began
to
think
of
all
the
queer
creatures
and
people
he
had
met
in
the
desert
and
to
wish
for
them
some
of
them
had
not
been
very
kind
to
him
but
he
did
not
remember
that
now
it
was
so
sad
to
be
quite
alone
in
the
world
without
even
a
small
beetle
to
visit
him
he
remembered
the
beautiful
people
of
the
mirage
and
the
black
people
of
the
sky
and
the
ostrich
and
old
jacob
and
the
savages
and
the
serpent
and
the
black
weasel
in
the
forest
he
stood
up
and
stared
all
round
to
see
if
anything
was
coming
but
he
could
see
nothing
and
hear
nothing
in
that
deep
silence
there
was
a
sound
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
great
distance
it
was
so
faint
then
it
grew
louder
and
nearer
and
far
away
he
saw
a
little
cloud
of
dust
and
then
even
through
the
dust
dark
forms
coming
swiftly
towards
him
the
sound
he
heard
was
like
a
long
halloo
a
cry
like
the
cry
of
a
man
but
wild
and
shrill
like
a
bird
cry
and
whenever
that
cry
was
uttered
it
was
followed
by
a
strange
confused
noise
as
of
the
neighing
of
many
horses
they
were
in
truth
horses
that
were
coming
swiftly
towards
him
a
herd
of
sixty
or
seventy
wild
horses
he
could
see
and
hear
them
only
too
plainly
now
looking
very
terrible
in
their
strength
and
speed
and
the
flowing
black
manes
that
covered
them
like
a
black
cloud
as
they
came
thundering
on
intending
perhaps
to
sweep
over
him
and
trample
him
to
death
with
their
hoofs
all
at
once
when
they
were
within
fifty
yards
of
martin
the
long
shrill
wild
cry
went
up
again
and
the
horses
swerved
to
one
side
and
went
sweeping
round
him
in
a
wide
circle
then
as
they
galloped
by
he
caught
sight
of
the
being
he
had
ever
seen
a
man
on
the
back
of
one
of
the
horses
naked
and
hairy
he
looked
like
a
baboon
as
he
crouched
doubled
up
gripping
the
shoulders
and
neck
of
the
horse
with
his
knees
clinging
with
his
hands
to
the
mane
and
craning
his
neck
like
a
flying
bird
it
was
this
strange
rider
who
had
uttered
the
long
piercing
cries
and
now
changing
his
voice
to
a
whinnying
sound
the
horses
came
to
a
stop
and
gathering
together
in
a
crowd
they
stood
tossing
their
manes
and
staring
at
martin
with
their
wild
startled
eyes
in
another
moment
the
wild
rider
came
bounding
out
from
among
them
and
moving
now
erect
now
on
all
fours
came
sideling
up
to
martin
flinging
his
arms
and
legs
about
wagging
his
head
grimacing
and
uttering
whinnying
and
other
curious
noises
never
had
martin
looked
upon
so
strange
a
man
he
was
long
and
lean
so
that
you
could
have
counted
his
ribs
and
he
was
stark
naked
except
for
the
hair
of
his
head
and
face
which
half
covered
him
his
skin
was
of
a
yellowish
brown
colour
and
the
hair
the
colour
of
old
dead
grass
and
it
was
coarse
and
tangled
falling
over
his
shoulders
and
back
and
covering
his
forehead
like
a
thatch
his
big
brown
nose
standing
out
beneath
it
like
a
beak
the
face
was
covered
with
the
beard
which
was
tangled
too
and
grew
down
to
his
waist
after
staring
at
martin
for
some
time
with
his
big
yellow
eyes
he
pranced
up
to
him
and
began
to
sniff
round
him
then
touched
him
with
his
nose
on
his
face
arms
and
shoulders
illustration
who
are
you
said
martin
in
astonishment
for
only
answer
the
other
squealed
and
whinnied
grimacing
and
kicking
his
legs
up
at
the
same
time
then
the
horses
advanced
to
them
and
gathering
round
in
a
close
crowd
began
touching
martin
with
their
noses
he
liked
it
the
softness
of
their
sensitive
skins
which
were
like
velvet
and
putting
up
his
hands
he
began
to
stroke
their
noses
then
one
by
one
after
smelling
him
and
being
touched
by
his
hand
they
turned
away
and
going
down
into
the
valley
were
soon
scattered
about
most
of
them
grazing
some
rolling
others
lying
stretched
out
on
the
grass
as
if
to
sleep
while
the
young
foals
in
the
troop
leaving
their
dams
began
playing
about
and
challenging
one
another
to
run
a
race
martin
following
and
watching
them
almost
wished
that
he
too
could
go
on
four
legs
to
join
them
in
their
games
he
trusted
those
wild
horses
but
he
was
still
puzzled
by
that
strange
man
who
had
also
left
him
now
and
was
going
quietly
round
on
all
fours
smelling
at
the
grass
he
found
something
to
his
liking
in
a
small
patch
of
tender
green
clover
which
he
began
nosing
and
tearing
it
up
with
his
teeth
then
turning
his
head
round
he
stared
back
at
martin
his
jaws
working
vigorously
all
the
time
the
stems
and
leaves
of
the
clover
he
was
eating
sticking
out
from
his
mouth
and
hanging
about
his
beard
all
at
once
he
jumped
up
and
flying
back
at
martin
snatched
him
up
from
the
ground
carried
him
to
the
clover
patch
and
set
him
upon
it
face
down
on
all
fours
then
when
martin
sat
up
he
grasped
him
by
the
head
and
forced
it
down
until
his
nose
was
on
the
grass
so
as
to
make
him
smell
it
and
know
that
it
was
good
but
smell
it
he
would
not
and
finally
the
other
seized
him
roughly
again
and
opening
his
mouth
forced
a
bunch
of
grass
into
it
illustration
it
grass
and
i
eat
it
screamed
martin
crying
with
anger
at
being
so
treated
and
spewing
the
green
stuff
out
of
his
mouth
then
the
man
released
him
and
withdrawing
a
space
of
two
or
three
yards
sat
down
on
his
haunches
and
planting
his
bony
elbows
on
his
knees
thrust
his
great
brown
fingers
in
his
tangled
hair
and
stared
at
martin
with
his
big
yellow
goat
eyes
for
a
long
time
suddenly
a
wild
excited
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
leaping
up
with
a
shrill
cry
which
caused
all
the
horses
to
look
round
at
him
he
once
more
snatched
martin
up
and
holding
him
firmly
gripped
to
his
ribby
side
by
his
arm
bounded
off
to
where
a
mare
was
standing
giving
suck
to
her
young
foal
with
a
vigorous
kick
he
sent
the
foal
away
and
forced
martin
to
take
his
place
and
to
make
it
easier
for
him
pressed
the
teat
into
his
mouth
martin
was
not
accustomed
to
feed
in
that
way
and
he
not
only
refused
to
suck
but
continued
to
cry
with
indignation
at
such
treatment
and
to
struggle
with
all
his
little
might
to
free
himself
his
striving
was
all
in
vain
and
the
man
seeing
that
he
would
not
suck
had
a
fresh
idea
and
gripping
martin
more
firmly
than
ever
with
one
hand
forced
and
held
his
mouth
open
and
with
the
other
drew
a
stream
of
milk
into
it
after
choking
and
spluttering
and
crying
more
than
ever
for
a
while
martin
began
to
grow
quiet
and
to
swallow
the
milk
with
some
satisfaction
for
he
was
very
hungry
and
thirsty
and
it
tasted
very
good
when
no
more
milk
could
be
drawn
from
the
teats
he
was
taken
to
a
second
mare
from
which
the
foal
was
kicked
away
with
as
little
ceremony
as
the
first
one
and
then
he
had
as
much
more
milk
as
he
wanted
and
began
to
like
being
fed
in
this
amusing
way
of
what
happened
after
that
martin
did
not
know
much
except
that
the
man
seemed
very
happy
after
feeding
him
he
set
martin
on
the
back
of
a
horse
then
jumped
and
danced
round
him
making
funny
chuckling
noises
after
which
he
rolled
on
the
grass
his
arms
and
legs
up
in
the
air
and
finally
pulling
martin
down
he
made
him
roll
too
but
the
little
fellow
was
too
tired
to
keep
his
eyes
any
longer
open
and
when
he
next
opened
them
it
was
morning
and
he
found
himself
lying
wedged
in
between
a
mare
and
her
young
foal
lying
side
by
side
close
together
there
too
was
the
wild
man
coiled
up
like
a
sleeping
dog
his
head
pillowed
on
the
foal
neck
and
the
hair
of
his
great
shaggy
beard
thrown
like
a
blanket
over
martin
he
very
soon
grew
accustomed
to
the
new
strange
manner
of
life
and
even
liked
it
those
big
wild
horses
with
their
shining
coats
brown
and
bay
and
black
and
sorrel
and
chestnut
and
their
black
manes
and
tails
that
swept
the
grass
when
they
moved
were
so
friendly
to
him
that
he
could
not
help
loving
them
as
he
went
about
among
them
when
they
grazed
every
horse
he
approached
would
raise
his
head
and
touch
his
face
and
arms
with
his
nose
o
you
dear
horse
martin
would
exclaim
rubbing
the
warm
sensitive
nose
with
his
hand
he
soon
discovered
that
they
were
just
as
fond
of
play
as
he
was
and
that
he
too
was
to
take
part
in
their
games
having
fed
as
long
as
they
wanted
that
morning
they
all
at
once
began
to
gather
together
coming
at
a
gallop
neighing
shrilly
then
the
wild
man
catching
martin
up
leaped
upon
the
back
of
one
of
the
horses
and
away
went
the
whole
troop
at
a
furious
pace
to
the
great
open
dry
plain
where
martin
had
met
with
them
on
the
previous
day
now
it
was
very
terrifying
for
him
at
first
to
be
in
the
midst
of
that
flying
crowd
as
the
animals
went
tearing
over
the
plain
which
seemed
to
shake
beneath
their
thundering
hoofs
while
their
human
leader
cheered
them
on
with
his
shrill
repeated
cries
but
in
a
little
while
he
too
caught
the
excitement
and
losing
all
his
fear
was
as
wildly
happy
as
the
others
crying
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
in
imitation
of
the
wild
man
after
an
hour
run
they
returned
to
the
valley
and
then
martin
without
being
compelled
to
do
so
rolled
about
on
the
grass
and
went
after
the
young
foals
when
they
came
out
to
challenge
one
another
to
a
game
he
tried
to
do
as
they
did
prancing
and
throwing
up
his
heels
and
snorting
but
when
they
ran
from
him
they
soon
left
him
hopelessly
behind
meanwhile
the
wild
man
kept
watch
over
him
feeding
him
with
mare
milk
and
inviting
him
from
time
to
time
to
smell
and
taste
the
tender
grass
best
of
all
was
when
they
went
for
another
run
in
the
evening
and
when
martin
was
no
longer
held
with
a
tight
grip
against
the
man
side
but
was
taught
or
allowed
to
hold
on
clinging
with
his
legs
to
the
man
body
and
clasping
him
round
the
neck
with
his
arms
his
fingers
tightly
holding
on
to
the
great
shaggy
beard
three
days
passed
in
this
way
and
if
his
time
had
been
much
longer
with
the
wild
horses
he
would
have
become
one
of
the
troop
and
would
perhaps
have
eaten
grass
too
and
forgotten
his
human
speech
or
that
he
was
a
little
boy
born
to
a
very
different
kind
of
life
but
it
was
not
to
be
and
in
the
end
he
was
separated
from
the
troop
by
accident
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
when
the
sun
was
setting
and
all
the
horses
were
scattered
about
in
the
valley
quietly
grazing
something
disturbed
them
it
might
have
been
a
sight
or
sound
of
some
feared
object
or
perhaps
the
wind
had
brought
the
smell
of
their
enemies
and
hunters
from
a
great
distance
to
their
nostrils
suddenly
they
were
all
in
a
wild
commotion
galloping
from
all
sides
toward
their
leader
and
he
picking
martin
up
was
quickly
on
a
horse
and
off
they
went
full
speed
but
not
towards
the
plain
where
they
were
accustomed
to
go
for
their
runs
now
they
fled
in
the
opposite
direction
down
to
the
river
into
it
they
went
into
that
wide
deep
dangerous
current
leaping
from
the
bank
each
horse
as
he
fell
into
the
water
with
a
tremendous
splash
disappearing
from
sight
but
in
another
moment
the
head
and
upper
part
of
the
neck
was
seen
to
rise
above
the
surface
until
the
whole
lot
were
in
and
appeared
to
martin
like
a
troop
of
horses
heads
swimming
without
bodies
over
the
river
he
clinging
to
the
neck
and
beard
of
the
wild
man
had
the
upper
half
of
his
body
out
of
the
cold
rushing
water
and
in
this
way
they
all
got
safely
across
and
up
the
opposite
bank
no
sooner
were
they
out
than
without
even
pausing
to
shake
the
water
from
their
skins
they
set
off
at
full
speed
across
the
valley
towards
the
distant
hills
now
on
this
side
at
a
distance
of
a
mile
or
so
from
the
river
there
were
vast
standing
on
low
land
dried
to
a
hard
crust
by
the
summer
heat
and
right
into
the
reeds
the
horses
rushed
and
struggled
to
force
their
way
through
the
reeds
were
dead
and
dry
so
tall
that
they
rose
high
above
the
horses
heads
and
growing
so
close
together
that
it
was
hard
to
struggle
through
them
then
when
they
were
in
the
midst
of
this
difficult
place
the
dry
crust
that
covered
the
low
ground
began
to
yield
to
the
heavy
hoofs
and
the
horses
sinking
to
their
knees
were
thrown
down
and
plunged
about
in
the
most
desperate
way
and
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
martin
was
struck
and
thrown
from
his
place
falling
amongst
the
reeds
luckily
he
was
not
trampled
upon
but
he
was
left
behind
and
then
what
a
dreadful
situation
was
his
when
the
whole
troop
had
at
last
succeeded
in
fighting
their
way
through
and
had
gone
away
leaving
him
in
that
dark
solitary
place
he
listened
until
the
sound
of
heavy
hoofs
and
the
long
cries
of
the
man
had
died
away
in
the
distance
then
the
silence
and
darkness
terrified
him
and
he
struggled
to
get
out
but
the
reeds
grew
so
close
together
that
before
he
had
pushed
a
dozen
yards
through
them
he
sank
down
unable
to
do
more
the
air
was
hot
and
close
and
still
down
there
on
the
ground
but
by
leaning
his
head
back
and
staring
straight
up
he
could
see
the
pale
night
sky
sprinkled
with
stars
in
the
openings
between
the
dry
leaves
and
spikes
of
the
reeds
poor
martin
could
do
nothing
but
gaze
up
at
the
little
he
could
see
of
the
sky
in
that
close
black
place
until
his
neck
ached
with
the
strain
but
at
last
to
make
him
hope
he
heard
a
sound
the
now
familiar
long
shrill
cry
of
the
wild
man
then
as
it
came
nearer
the
sound
of
tramping
hoofs
and
neighing
of
the
horses
was
heard
and
the
cries
and
grew
louder
and
then
fainter
in
turns
and
sounded
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
and
he
knew
that
they
were
looking
for
him
i
here
here
he
cried
oh
dear
horses
come
and
take
me
away
but
they
could
not
hear
him
and
at
last
the
sound
of
their
neighing
and
the
wild
long
cries
died
away
altogether
and
martin
was
left
alone
in
that
black
silent
place
chapter
xi
the
lady
of
the
hills
no
escape
was
possible
for
poor
little
martin
so
long
as
it
was
dark
and
there
he
had
to
stay
all
night
but
morning
brought
him
comfort
for
now
he
could
see
the
that
hemmed
him
in
all
round
and
by
using
his
hands
to
bend
them
from
him
on
either
side
he
could
push
through
them
the
sunlight
touched
the
tops
of
the
tall
plants
and
working
his
way
towards
the
side
from
which
the
light
came
he
soon
made
his
escape
from
that
prison
and
came
into
a
place
where
he
could
walk
without
trouble
and
could
see
the
earth
and
sky
again
further
on
in
a
grassy
part
of
the
valley
he
found
some
sweet
roots
wrhich
greatly
refreshed
him
and
at
last
leaving
the
valley
he
came
out
on
a
high
grassy
plain
and
saw
the
hills
before
him
looking
very
much
nearer
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
look
before
up
till
now
they
had
appeared
like
masses
of
dark
blue
banked
up
cloud
resting
on
the
earth
now
he
could
see
that
they
were
indeed
stone
blue
stone
piled
up
in
huge
cliffs
and
crags
high
above
the
green
world
he
could
see
the
roughness
of
the
heaped
up
rocks
the
fissures
and
crevices
in
the
sides
of
the
hills
and
here
and
there
the
patches
of
green
colour
where
trees
and
bushes
had
taken
root
how
wonderful
it
seemed
to
martin
that
evening
standing
there
in
the
wide
green
plain
the
level
sun
at
his
back
shining
on
his
naked
body
making
him
look
like
a
statue
of
a
small
boy
carved
in
whitest
marble
or
alabaster
then
to
make
the
sight
he
gazed
on
still
more
enchanting
just
as
the
sun
went
down
the
colour
of
the
hills
changed
from
stone
blue
to
a
purple
that
was
like
the
purple
of
ripe
plums
and
grapes
only
more
beautiful
and
bright
in
a
few
minutes
the
purple
colour
faded
away
and
the
hills
grew
shadowy
and
dark
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
and
he
was
too
tired
to
walk
further
he
was
very
hungry
and
thirsty
too
and
so
when
he
had
found
a
few
small
white
and
had
made
a
poor
supper
on
them
he
gathered
some
dry
grass
into
a
little
heap
and
lying
down
in
it
was
soon
in
a
sound
sleep
it
was
not
until
the
late
afternoon
next
day
that
martin
at
last
got
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
or
mountain
and
looking
up
he
saw
it
like
a
great
wall
of
stone
above
him
with
trees
and
bushes
and
trailing
vines
growing
out
of
the
crevices
and
on
the
narrow
ledges
of
the
rock
going
some
distance
he
came
to
a
place
where
he
could
ascend
and
here
he
began
slowly
walking
upwards
at
first
he
could
hardly
contain
his
delight
where
everything
looked
new
and
strange
and
here
he
found
some
very
beautiful
flowers
but
as
he
toiled
on
he
grew
more
tired
and
hungry
at
every
step
and
then
to
make
matters
worse
his
legs
began
to
pain
so
that
he
could
hardly
lift
them
it
was
a
curious
pain
which
he
had
never
felt
in
his
sturdy
little
legs
before
in
all
his
wanderings
then
a
cloud
came
over
the
sun
and
a
sharp
wind
sprang
up
that
made
him
shiver
with
cold
then
followed
a
shower
of
rain
and
now
martin
feeling
sore
and
miserable
crept
into
a
cavity
beneath
a
pile
of
overhanging
rocks
for
shelter
he
was
out
of
the
rain
there
but
the
wind
blew
in
on
him
until
it
made
his
teeth
chatter
with
cold
he
began
to
think
of
his
mother
and
of
all
the
comforts
of
his
lost
home
the
bread
and
milk
when
he
was
hungry
the
warm
clothing
and
the
soft
little
bed
with
its
snowy
white
coverlid
in
which
he
had
slept
so
sweetly
every
night
o
mother
mother
he
cried
but
his
mother
was
too
far
off
to
hear
his
piteous
cry
when
the
shower
was
over
he
crept
out
of
his
shelter
again
and
with
his
little
feet
already
bleeding
from
the
sharp
rocks
tried
to
climb
on
in
one
spot
he
found
some
small
creeping
myrtle
plants
covered
with
ripe
white
berries
and
although
they
had
a
very
pungent
taste
he
ate
his
fill
of
them
he
was
so
very
hungry
then
feeling
that
he
could
climb
no
higher
he
began
to
look
round
for
a
dry
sheltered
spot
to
pass
the
night
in
in
a
little
while
he
came
to
a
great
smooth
flat
stone
that
looked
like
a
floor
in
a
room
and
was
about
forty
yards
wide
nothing
grew
on
it
except
some
small
tufts
of
grey
lichen
but
on
the
further
side
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
rocky
precipice
there
was
a
thick
bed
of
tall
green
and
yellow
ferns
and
among
the
ferns
he
hoped
to
find
a
place
to
lie
down
in
very
slowly
he
limped
across
the
open
space
crying
with
the
pain
he
felt
at
every
step
but
when
he
reached
the
bed
of
ferns
he
all
at
once
saw
sitting
among
the
tall
fronds
on
a
stone
a
woman
in
a
green
dress
who
was
gazing
very
steadily
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
love
and
compassion
at
her
side
there
crouched
a
big
yellow
beast
covered
all
over
with
black
spots
with
a
big
round
head
and
looking
just
like
a
cat
but
a
hundred
times
larger
than
the
biggest
cat
he
had
ever
seen
the
animal
rose
up
with
a
low
sound
like
a
growl
and
glared
at
martin
with
its
wide
yellow
fiery
eyes
which
so
terrified
him
that
he
dared
not
move
another
step
until
the
womaan
speaking
very
gently
to
him
told
him
not
to
fear
she
caressed
the
great
beast
making
him
lie
down
again
then
coming
forward
and
taking
martin
by
the
hand
she
drew
him
up
to
her
knees
illustration
what
is
your
name
poor
little
suffering
child
she
asked
bending
down
to
him
and
speaking
softly
martin
what
yours
he
returned
still
half
sobbing
and
rubbing
his
eyes
with
his
little
fists
i
am
called
the
lady
of
the
hills
and
i
live
here
alone
in
the
mountain
tell
me
why
do
you
cry
martin
because
i
so
cold
and
and
my
legs
hurt
so
and
and
because
i
want
to
go
back
to
my
mother
she
over
there
said
he
with
another
sob
pointing
vaguely
to
the
great
plain
beneath
their
feet
extending
far
far
away
into
the
blue
distance
where
the
crimson
sun
was
now
setting
i
will
be
your
mother
and
you
shall
live
with
me
here
on
the
mountain
she
said
caressing
his
little
cold
hands
with
hers
will
you
call
me
mother
you
are
my
mother
he
returned
warmly
i
do
want
to
call
you
mother
when
i
love
you
so
much
dear
child
she
pleaded
bending
down
until
her
lips
were
close
to
his
averted
face
how
that
great
spotted
cat
stares
at
me
he
suddenly
said
do
you
think
it
will
kill
me
no
no
he
only
wants
to
play
with
you
will
you
not
even
look
at
me
martin
he
still
resisted
her
but
her
hand
felt
very
warm
and
comforting
it
was
such
a
large
warm
protecting
hand
so
pleasant
did
it
feel
that
after
a
little
while
he
began
to
move
his
hand
up
her
beautiful
soft
white
arm
until
it
touched
her
hair
for
her
hair
was
unbound
and
loose
it
was
dark
and
finer
than
the
finest
spun
silk
and
fell
all
over
her
shoulders
and
down
her
back
to
the
stone
she
sat
on
he
let
his
fingers
stray
in
and
out
among
it
and
it
felt
like
the
soft
warm
down
that
lines
a
little
bird
nest
to
his
skin
finally
he
touched
her
neck
and
allowed
his
hand
to
rest
there
it
was
such
a
soft
warm
neck
at
length
but
reluctantly
for
his
little
rebellious
heart
was
not
yet
wholly
subdued
he
raised
his
eyes
to
her
face
oh
how
beautiful
she
was
her
love
and
eager
desire
to
win
him
had
flushed
her
clear
olive
skin
with
rich
red
colour
out
of
her
sweet
red
lips
half
parted
came
her
warm
breath
on
his
cheek
more
fragrant
than
wild
flowers
and
her
large
dark
eyes
were
gazing
down
into
his
with
such
a
tenderness
in
them
that
martin
seeing
it
felt
a
strange
little
shudder
pass
through
him
and
scarcely
knew
whether
to
think
it
pleasant
or
painful
dear
child
i
love
you
so
much
she
spoke
will
you
not
call
me
mother
dropping
his
eyes
and
with
trembling
lips
feeling
a
little
ashamed
at
being
conquered
at
last
he
whispered
mother
she
raised
him
in
her
arms
and
pressed
him
to
her
bosom
wrapping
her
hair
like
a
warm
mantle
round
him
and
in
less
than
one
minute
overcome
by
fatigue
he
fell
fast
asleep
in
her
arms
chapter
xii
the
little
people
underground
when
he
awoke
martin
found
himself
lying
on
a
soft
downy
bed
in
a
dim
stone
chamber
and
feeling
silky
hair
over
his
cheek
and
neck
and
arms
he
knew
that
he
was
still
with
his
new
strange
mother
the
beautiful
lady
of
the
mountain
she
seeing
him
awake
took
him
up
in
her
arms
and
holding
him
against
her
bosom
carried
him
through
a
long
winding
stone
passage
and
out
into
the
bright
morning
sunlight
there
by
a
small
spring
of
clearest
water
that
gushed
from
the
rock
she
washed
his
scratched
and
bruised
skin
and
rubbed
it
with
unguents
and
gave
him
food
and
drink
the
great
spotted
beast
sat
by
them
all
the
time
purring
like
a
cat
and
at
intervals
he
tried
to
entice
martin
to
leave
the
woman
lap
and
play
with
him
but
she
would
not
let
him
out
of
her
arms
all
day
she
nursed
and
fondled
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
helpless
babe
instead
of
the
sturdy
little
and
adventurer
he
had
proved
himself
to
be
she
also
made
him
tell
her
the
story
of
how
he
had
got
lost
and
of
all
the
wonderful
things
that
had
happened
to
him
in
his
wanderings
in
the
wilderness
the
people
of
the
mirage
and
old
jacob
and
the
savages
the
great
forest
the
serpent
the
owl
the
wild
horses
and
wild
man
and
the
black
people
of
the
sky
but
it
was
of
the
mirage
and
the
procession
of
lovely
beings
about
which
he
spoke
most
and
questioned
her
do
you
think
it
was
all
a
dream
he
kept
asking
her
the
queen
and
all
those
people
she
was
vexed
at
the
question
and
turning
her
face
away
refused
to
answer
him
for
though
at
all
other
times
and
when
he
spoke
of
other
things
she
was
gentle
and
loving
in
her
manner
the
moment
he
spoke
of
the
queen
of
the
mirage
and
the
gifts
she
had
bestowed
on
him
she
became
impatient
and
rebuked
him
for
saying
such
foolish
things
at
length
she
spoke
and
told
him
that
it
was
a
dream
a
very
very
idle
dream
a
dream
that
was
not
worth
dreaming
that
he
must
never
speak
of
it
again
never
think
of
it
but
forget
it
just
as
he
had
forgotten
all
the
other
vain
silly
dreams
he
had
ever
had
and
having
said
this
much
a
little
sharply
she
smiled
again
and
fondled
him
and
promised
that
when
he
next
slept
he
should
have
a
good
dream
one
worth
the
dreaming
and
worth
remembering
and
talking
about
she
held
him
away
from
her
seating
him
on
her
knees
to
look
at
his
face
and
said
for
oh
dear
little
martin
you
are
lovely
and
sweet
to
look
at
and
you
are
mine
my
own
sweet
child
and
so
long
as
you
live
with
me
on
the
hills
and
love
me
and
eall
me
mother
you
shall
be
happy
and
everything
you
see
sleeping
and
waking
shall
seem
strange
and
beautiful
it
was
quite
true
that
he
was
sweet
to
look
at
very
pretty
with
his
skin
deepening
to
red
on
his
cheeks
and
his
hair
curling
all
over
his
head
was
of
a
bright
golden
chestnut
colour
and
his
eyes
were
a
very
bright
blue
and
looked
keen
and
straight
at
you
just
like
a
bird
eyes
that
seem
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
and
yet
seeing
everything
after
this
martin
was
eager
to
go
to
sleep
at
once
and
have
the
promised
dream
but
his
very
eagerness
kept
him
wide
awake
all
day
and
even
after
going
to
bed
in
that
dim
chamber
in
the
heart
of
the
hill
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
dropped
off
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
very
wide
awake
and
that
he
heard
a
voice
speaking
in
the
chamber
and
that
he
started
up
to
listen
to
it
do
you
not
know
that
there
are
things
just
as
strange
underground
as
above
it
said
the
voice
martin
could
not
see
the
speaker
but
he
answered
quite
boldly
no
there
nothing
underground
except
earth
and
worms
and
roots
i
seen
it
when
they
been
digging
oh
but
there
is
said
the
voice
you
can
see
for
yourself
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
find
a
path
leading
down
and
to
follow
it
there
a
path
over
there
just
in
front
of
you
you
can
see
the
opening
from
where
you
are
lying
he
looked
and
sure
enough
there
an
opening
and
a
dim
passage
running
down
through
the
solid
rock
up
he
jumped
fired
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
new
and
wonderful
things
and
without
looking
any
more
to
see
who
had
spoken
to
him
he
ran
over
to
it
the
passage
had
a
smooth
floor
of
stone
and
sloped
downward
into
the
earth
and
went
round
and
round
in
an
immense
spiral
but
the
circles
were
so
wide
that
martin
scarcely
knew
that
he
was
not
travelling
in
a
straight
line
have
you
by
chance
ever
seen
a
buzzard
or
stork
or
vulture
or
some
other
great
bird
soaring
upwards
into
the
sky
in
wide
circles
each
circle
taking
it
higher
above
the
earth
until
it
looked
like
a
mere
black
speck
in
the
vast
blue
heavens
and
at
length
disappeared
altogether
just
in
that
way
going
round
and
round
in
just
such
wide
circles
lightly
running
all
the
time
with
never
a
pause
to
rest
and
without
feeling
in
the
least
tired
martin
went
on
only
down
and
down
and
further
down
instead
of
up
and
up
like
the
soaring
bird
until
he
was
as
far
under
the
mountain
as
ever
any
buzzard
or
crane
or
eagle
soared
above
it
thus
running
he
came
at
last
out
of
the
passage
to
an
open
room
or
space
so
wide
that
look
which
way
he
would
he
could
see
no
end
to
it
the
stone
roof
of
this
place
was
held
up
by
huge
stone
pillars
standing
scattered
about
like
groups
of
great
trees
many
times
bigger
round
than
hogsheads
here
and
there
in
the
roof
or
the
stone
overhead
were
immense
black
caverns
which
almost
frightened
him
to
gaze
up
at
them
they
were
so
vast
and
black
and
no
light
or
sun
or
moon
came
down
into
that
deep
part
of
the
earth
the
light
was
from
big
fires
and
they
were
fires
of
smithies
burning
all
about
him
sending
up
great
flames
and
clouds
of
black
smoke
which
rose
and
floated
upwards
through
those
big
black
caverns
in
the
roof
crowds
of
people
were
gathered
around
the
smithies
all
very
busy
heating
metal
and
hammering
on
anvils
like
blacksmiths
never
had
he
seen
so
many
people
nor
ever
had
he
seen
such
busy
men
as
these
rushing
about
here
and
there
shouting
and
colliding
with
one
another
bringing
and
carrying
huge
loads
in
baskets
on
their
backs
and
altogether
the
sight
of
them
and
the
racket
and
the
smoke
and
dust
and
the
blazing
fires
was
almost
too
much
for
martin
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
was
tempted
to
turn
and
run
back
into
the
passage
through
which
he
had
come
but
the
strangeness
of
it
all
kept
him
there
and
then
he
began
to
look
more
closely
at
the
people
for
these
were
the
little
men
that
live
under
the
earth
and
they
were
unlike
anything
he
had
seen
on
its
surface
they
were
very
stout
little
men
dressed
in
coarse
dark
clothes
covered
with
dust
and
grime
and
they
had
dark
faces
and
long
hair
and
rough
unkempt
beards
they
had
very
long
arms
and
big
hands
like
baboons
and
there
was
not
one
among
them
who
looked
taller
than
martin
himself
after
looking
at
them
he
did
not
feel
at
all
afraid
of
them
he
only
wanted
very
much
to
know
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing
and
why
they
were
so
excited
and
noisy
over
their
work
so
he
thrust
himself
among
them
going
to
the
smithies
where
they
were
in
crowds
and
peering
curiously
at
them
then
he
began
to
notice
that
his
coming
among
them
created
a
great
commotion
for
no
sooner
would
he
appear
than
all
work
would
be
instantly
suspended
down
would
go
their
baskets
and
loads
of
wood
their
hammers
and
implements
of
all
kinds
and
they
would
stare
and
point
at
him
all
jabbering
together
so
that
the
noise
was
as
if
a
thousand
cockatoos
and
parrots
and
paroquets
were
all
screaming
at
once
what
it
was
all
about
he
could
not
tell
as
he
could
not
make
out
what
they
said
he
could
only
see
and
plainly
enough
that
his
presence
astonished
and
upset
them
for
as
he
went
about
among
them
they
fell
back
before
him
crowding
together
and
all
staring
and
pointing
at
him
but
at
length
he
began
to
make
out
what
they
were
saying
they
were
all
exclaiming
and
talking
about
him
look
at
him
look
at
him
they
cried
who
is
he
what
martin
this
martin
never
no
no
no
yes
yes
yes
martin
himself
martin
with
nothing
on
not
a
shred
not
a
thread
impossible
it
can
not
be
nothing
so
strange
has
ever
happened
do
you
say
that
martin
is
naked
oh
dreadful
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
his
toes
naked
as
he
was
born
no
clothes
no
clothes
oh
no
it
ca
be
martin
it
is
it
is
and
so
on
and
on
until
martin
could
not
endure
it
longer
for
he
had
been
naked
for
days
and
days
and
had
ceased
to
think
about
it
and
in
fact
did
not
know
that
he
was
naked
and
now
hearing
their
remarks
and
seeing
how
they
were
disturbed
he
looked
down
at
himself
and
saw
that
it
was
indeed
so
that
he
had
nothing
on
and
he
grew
ashamed
and
frightened
and
thought
he
would
run
and
hide
himself
from
them
in
some
hole
in
the
ground
but
there
was
no
place
to
hide
in
for
now
they
had
gathered
all
round
him
in
a
vast
crowd
so
that
whichever
way
he
turned
there
before
him
they
appeared
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
dark
excited
faces
hundreds
of
grimy
hands
all
pointing
at
him
then
all
at
once
he
caught
sight
of
an
old
rag
of
a
garment
lying
on
the
ground
among
the
ashes
and
cinders
and
he
thought
he
would
cover
himself
with
it
and
picking
it
hastily
up
was
just
going
to
put
it
round
him
when
a
great
roar
of
no
burst
out
from
the
crowd
he
was
almost
deafened
with
the
sound
so
that
he
stood
trembling
with
the
old
dirty
rag
of
cloth
in
his
hand
then
one
of
the
little
men
came
up
to
him
and
snatching
the
rag
from
his
hand
flung
it
angrily
down
upon
the
floor
then
as
if
afraid
of
remaining
so
near
martin
he
backed
away
into
the
crowd
again
just
then
martin
heard
a
very
low
voice
close
to
his
ear
speaking
to
him
but
when
he
looked
round
he
could
see
no
person
near
him
he
knew
it
was
the
same
voice
which
had
spoken
to
him
in
the
cave
where
he
slept
and
had
told
him
to
go
down
into
that
place
underground
illustration
do
not
fear
said
the
gentle
voice
to
martin
say
to
the
little
men
that
you
have
lost
your
clothes
and
ask
them
for
something
to
put
on
then
martin
who
had
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
the
angry
crowd
took
courage
and
looking
at
them
said
half
sobbing
o
little
men
i
lost
my
clothes
wo
you
give
me
something
to
put
on
this
speech
had
a
wonderful
effect
instantly
there
was
a
mighty
rush
all
the
little
men
hurrying
away
in
all
directions
shouting
and
tumbling
over
each
other
in
their
haste
to
get
away
and
it
looked
to
martin
as
if
they
were
having
a
great
struggle
or
contest
over
something
they
were
all
struggling
to
get
possession
of
a
small
closed
basket
and
it
was
like
a
game
of
football
with
hundreds
of
persons
all
playing
all
fighting
for
possession
of
the
ball
at
length
one
of
them
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
the
basket
and
escaping
from
all
the
others
who
opposed
him
and
running
to
martin
he
threw
it
down
at
his
feet
and
lifting
the
lid
displayed
to
his
sight
a
bundle
of
the
most
beautiful
clothes
ever
seen
by
child
or
man
with
a
glad
cry
martin
pulled
them
out
but
the
next
moment
a
very
little
man
with
a
great
white
beard
sprang
forward
and
snatched
them
out
of
his
hand
no
no
he
shouted
these
are
not
fit
for
martin
to
wear
they
will
soil
saying
which
he
flung
them
down
on
that
dusty
floor
with
its
litter
of
cinders
and
dirt
and
began
to
trample
on
them
as
if
in
a
great
passion
then
he
snatched
them
up
again
and
shook
them
and
all
could
see
that
they
were
unsoiled
and
just
as
bright
and
beautiful
as
before
then
martin
tried
to
take
them
from
him
but
the
other
would
not
let
him
never
shall
martin
wear
such
poor
clothes
shouted
the
old
man
they
will
not
even
keep
out
the
wet
and
with
that
he
thrust
them
into
a
great
tub
of
water
and
jumping
in
began
treading
them
down
with
his
feet
but
when
he
pulled
them
out
again
and
shook
them
before
their
faces
all
saw
that
they
were
as
dry
and
bright
as
before
give
them
to
me
cried
martin
thinking
that
it
was
all
right
now
never
shall
martin
wear
such
poor
clothes
they
will
not
resist
fire
cried
the
old
man
and
into
the
flames
he
flung
them
martin
now
gave
up
all
hopes
of
possessing
them
and
was
ready
to
burst
into
tears
at
their
loss
when
out
of
the
fire
they
were
pulled
again
and
it
was
seen
that
the
flames
had
not
injured
or
tarnished
them
in
the
least
once
more
martin
put
out
his
arms
and
this
time
he
was
allowed
to
take
those
beautiful
clothes
and
then
just
as
he
clasped
them
to
him
with
a
cry
of
delight
he
woke
his
head
was
lying
on
his
new
mother
arm
and
she
was
awake
watching
him
o
mother
what
a
nice
dream
i
had
o
such
pretty
clothes
why
did
i
wake
so
soon
she
laughed
and
touched
his
arms
showing
him
that
they
were
still
clasping
that
beautiful
suit
of
clothes
to
his
breast
the
very
clothes
of
his
wonderful
dream
chapter
xiii
the
great
blue
water
there
was
not
in
all
that
land
nor
perhaps
in
all
the
wide
world
a
happier
little
boy
than
martin
when
after
waking
from
his
sleep
and
dream
he
dressed
himself
for
the
first
time
in
that
new
suit
and
went
out
from
the
cave
into
the
morning
sunlight
he
then
felt
the
comfort
of
such
clothes
for
they
were
softer
than
the
finest
softest
down
or
silk
to
his
skin
and
kept
him
warm
when
it
was
cold
and
cool
when
it
was
hot
and
dry
when
it
rained
on
him
and
the
earth
could
not
soil
them
nor
the
thorns
tear
them
and
above
everything
they
were
the
most
beautiful
clothes
ever
seen
their
colour
was
a
deep
moss
green
or
so
it
looked
at
a
little
distance
or
when
seen
in
the
shade
but
in
the
sunshine
it
sparkled
as
if
small
shining
beads
had
been
sewn
in
the
cloth
only
there
were
no
beads
it
was
only
the
shining
threads
that
made
it
sparkle
so
like
clean
sand
in
the
sun
when
you
looked
closely
at
the
cloth
you
could
see
the
lovely
pattern
woven
in
it
small
leaf
and
flower
the
leaves
like
moss
leaves
and
the
flowers
like
the
pimpernel
but
not
half
so
big
and
they
were
yellow
and
red
and
blue
and
violet
in
colour
but
there
were
many
many
things
besides
the
lovely
clothes
to
make
him
contented
and
happy
first
the
beautiful
woman
of
the
hills
who
loved
and
cherished
him
and
made
him
call
her
by
the
sweet
name
of
mother
so
many
times
every
day
that
he
well
nigh
forgot
she
was
not
his
real
mother
then
there
was
the
great
stony
on
which
he
now
lived
for
a
playground
where
he
could
wander
all
day
among
the
rocks
overgrown
with
creepers
and
strange
flowers
he
had
never
seen
on
the
plain
below
the
birds
and
butterflies
he
saw
there
were
different
from
those
he
had
always
seen
so
were
the
snakes
which
he
often
found
sleepily
coiled
up
on
the
rocks
and
the
little
swift
lizards
even
the
water
looked
strange
and
more
beautiful
than
the
water
in
the
plain
for
here
it
gushed
out
of
the
living
rock
sparkling
like
crystal
in
the
sun
and
was
always
cold
when
he
dipped
his
hands
in
it
even
on
the
hottest
days
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
thing
was
the
immense
distance
he
could
see
when
he
looked
away
from
the
hillside
across
the
plain
and
saw
the
great
dark
forest
where
he
had
been
and
the
earth
stretching
far
far
away
beyond
then
there
was
his
playmate
the
great
cat
who
followed
him
about
and
was
always
ready
for
a
frolic
playing
in
a
very
curious
way
whenever
martin
would
prepare
to
take
a
running
leap
or
a
swift
run
down
a
slope
the
animal
stealing
quietly
up
behind
would
put
out
a
claw
from
his
big
soft
foot
a
great
white
claw
as
big
as
an
owl
beak
and
pull
him
suddenly
back
at
last
martin
would
lose
his
temper
and
picking
up
a
stick
would
turn
on
his
playmate
and
away
the
animal
would
fly
pretending
to
be
afraid
and
going
over
bushes
and
big
stones
with
tremendous
leaps
to
disappear
from
sight
on
the
mountain
side
but
very
soon
he
would
steal
secretly
back
by
some
other
way
to
spring
upon
martin
unawares
and
roll
him
over
and
over
on
the
ground
growling
as
if
angry
and
making
believe
to
worry
him
with
his
great
white
teeth
although
never
really
hurting
him
in
the
least
he
played
with
martin
just
as
a
cat
plays
with
its
kitten
when
it
pretends
to
punish
it
whenever
martin
began
to
show
the
least
sign
of
weariness
the
lady
of
the
hills
would
call
him
to
her
then
lying
back
among
the
ferns
she
would
unbind
her
long
silky
tresses
to
let
him
play
with
them
for
this
was
always
a
delight
to
him
then
she
would
gather
her
hair
up
again
and
dress
it
with
yellow
flowers
and
glossy
dark
green
leaves
to
make
herself
look
more
lovely
than
ever
at
other
times
taking
him
on
her
shoulders
she
would
bound
nimbly
as
a
wild
goat
up
the
steepest
places
springing
from
crag
to
crag
and
dancing
gaily
along
the
narrow
ledges
of
rock
where
it
made
him
dizzy
to
look
down
then
when
the
sun
was
near
setting
when
long
shadows
from
rocks
and
trees
began
to
creep
over
the
mountain
and
he
had
eaten
the
fruits
and
honey
and
other
wild
delicacies
she
provided
she
would
make
him
lie
on
her
bosom
playing
with
her
loose
hair
and
listening
to
her
singing
as
she
rocked
herself
on
a
stone
he
would
presently
fall
asleep
in
the
morning
on
waking
he
would
always
find
himself
lying
still
clasped
to
her
breast
in
that
great
dim
cavern
and
almost
always
when
he
woke
he
would
find
her
crying
sometimes
on
opening
his
eyes
he
would
find
her
asleep
but
with
traces
of
tears
on
her
face
showing
that
she
had
been
awake
and
crying
one
afternoon
seeing
him
tired
of
play
and
hard
to
amuse
she
took
him
in
her
arms
and
carried
him
right
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
where
it
grew
so
steep
that
even
the
big
cat
could
not
follow
them
finally
she
brought
him
out
on
the
extreme
summit
and
looking
round
he
seemed
to
see
the
whole
world
spread
out
beneath
him
below
down
there
were
some
wild
cattle
feeding
on
the
mountain
side
and
they
looked
at
that
distance
no
bigger
than
mice
looking
eastwards
he
beheld
just
beyond
the
plain
a
vast
expanse
of
blue
water
extending
leagues
and
leagues
away
until
it
faded
into
the
blue
sky
he
shouted
with
joy
when
he
saw
it
and
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
this
wonderful
world
of
water
take
me
there
take
me
there
he
cried
she
only
shook
her
head
and
tried
to
laugh
him
out
of
such
a
wish
but
when
she
attempted
to
carry
him
back
down
the
mountain
he
refused
to
move
from
the
spot
nor
would
he
speak
to
her
nor
look
up
into
her
pleading
face
but
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
distant
blue
ocean
which
had
so
enchanted
him
for
it
seemed
to
martin
the
most
wonderful
thing
he
had
ever
beheld
at
length
it
began
to
grow
cold
on
the
summit
then
with
gentle
caressing
words
she
made
him
turn
and
look
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
heavens
where
the
sun
was
just
setting
behind
a
great
mass
of
clouds
dark
purple
and
crimson
rising
into
peaks
that
were
like
hills
of
pearl
and
all
the
heavens
beyond
them
a
pale
flame
filled
with
wonder
at
all
this
rich
and
varied
colour
he
forgot
the
ocean
for
a
moment
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
do
you
know
dear
martin
said
she
what
we
should
find
there
where
it
all
looks
so
bright
and
beautiful
if
i
had
wings
and
could
fly
with
you
clinging
to
my
bosom
like
a
little
bat
clinging
to
its
mother
when
she
flies
abroad
in
the
twilight
what
asked
martin
only
dark
dark
clouds
full
of
rain
and
cutting
hail
and
thunder
and
lightning
that
is
how
it
is
with
the
sea
martin
it
makes
you
love
it
when
you
see
it
at
a
distance
but
oh
it
is
cruel
and
treacherous
and
when
it
has
once
got
you
in
its
power
then
it
is
more
terrible
than
the
thunder
and
lightning
in
the
cloud
do
you
remember
when
you
first
came
to
me
naked
shivering
with
cold
with
your
little
bare
feet
blistered
and
bleeding
from
the
sharp
stones
how
i
comforted
you
with
my
love
and
you
found
it
warm
and
pleasant
lying
on
my
breast
the
sea
will
not
comfort
you
in
that
way
it
will
clasp
you
to
a
cold
cold
breast
and
kiss
you
with
bitter
salt
lips
and
carry
you
down
where
it
is
always
dark
where
you
will
never
never
see
the
blue
sky
and
sunshine
and
flowers
again
martin
shivered
and
nestled
closer
to
her
and
then
while
the
shadows
of
evening
were
gathering
round
them
she
sat
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
on
a
stone
murmuring
many
tender
sweet
words
to
him
until
the
music
of
her
voice
and
the
warmth
of
her
bosom
made
him
sleep
chapter
xiv
the
wonders
of
the
hills
now
although
martin
had
gone
very
comfortably
to
sleep
in
her
arms
and
found
it
sweet
to
be
watched
over
so
tenderly
he
was
not
the
happy
little
boy
he
had
been
before
the
sight
of
the
distant
ocean
and
she
knew
it
and
was
troubled
in
her
mind
and
anxious
to
do
something
to
make
him
forget
that
great
blue
water
she
could
do
many
things
and
above
all
she
could
show
him
new
and
wonderful
things
in
the
hills
where
she
wished
to
keep
him
always
with
her
to
caress
him
to
feed
and
watch
over
him
by
day
and
hold
him
in
her
arms
when
he
slept
at
night
all
that
was
less
to
him
than
the
sight
of
something
new
and
strange
she
knew
this
well
and
therefore
determined
to
satisfy
his
desire
and
make
his
life
so
full
that
he
would
always
be
more
than
contented
with
it
in
the
morning
he
went
out
on
the
hillside
wandering
listlessly
among
the
rocks
and
when
the
big
cat
found
him
there
and
tried
to
tempt
him
to
a
game
he
refused
to
play
for
he
had
not
yet
got
over
his
disappointment
and
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
sea
but
the
cat
did
not
know
that
anything
was
the
matter
with
him
and
was
more
determined
to
play
than
ever
crouching
now
here
now
there
among
the
stones
and
bushes
he
would
spring
out
upon
martin
and
pull
him
down
with
its
big
paws
and
this
so
enraged
him
that
picking
up
a
stick
he
struck
furiously
at
his
tormentor
but
the
cat
was
too
quick
for
him
he
dodged
the
blows
then
knocked
the
stick
out
of
his
hand
and
finally
martin
to
escape
from
him
crept
into
a
crevice
in
a
rock
where
the
cat
could
not
reach
him
and
refused
to
come
out
even
when
the
lady
of
the
hills
came
to
look
for
him
and
begged
him
to
come
to
her
when
at
last
compelled
by
hunger
he
returned
to
her
he
was
silent
and
sullen
and
would
not
be
caressed
he
saw
no
more
of
the
cat
and
when
next
day
he
asked
her
where
it
was
she
said
that
it
had
gone
from
them
and
would
return
no
more
that
she
had
sent
it
away
because
it
had
vexed
him
this
made
martin
sulk
and
he
would
have
gone
away
and
hidden
himself
from
her
had
she
not
caught
him
up
in
her
arms
he
struggled
to
free
himself
but
could
not
and
she
then
carried
him
away
a
long
distance
down
the
until
they
came
to
a
small
dell
green
with
creepers
and
bushes
with
a
deep
carpet
of
dry
moss
on
the
ground
and
here
she
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
to
him
the
cat
was
a
very
beautiful
beast
with
his
spotted
hide
she
said
and
you
liked
to
play
with
him
sometimes
but
in
a
little
while
you
will
be
glad
that
he
has
gone
from
you
he
asked
her
why
because
though
he
was
fond
of
you
and
liked
to
follow
you
about
and
play
with
you
he
is
very
fierce
and
powerful
and
all
the
other
beasts
are
afraid
of
him
so
long
as
he
was
with
us
they
would
not
come
but
now
he
has
gone
they
will
come
to
you
and
let
you
go
to
them
where
are
they
said
martin
his
curiosity
greatly
excited
let
us
wait
here
she
said
and
perhaps
we
shall
see
one
so
they
waited
and
were
silent
and
as
nothing
came
and
nothing
happened
martin
sitting
on
the
mossy
ground
began
to
feel
a
strange
drowsiness
stealing
over
him
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
round
he
wanted
to
keep
very
wide
awake
and
alert
so
as
not
to
miss
the
sight
of
anything
that
might
come
he
was
vexed
with
himself
for
feeling
drowsy
and
wondered
why
it
was
then
listening
to
the
low
continuous
hum
of
the
bees
he
concluded
that
it
was
that
low
soft
humming
sound
that
made
him
sleepy
he
began
to
look
at
the
bees
and
saw
that
they
were
unlike
other
wild
bees
he
knew
that
they
were
like
in
shape
but
much
smaller
and
were
all
of
a
golden
brown
colour
they
were
in
scores
and
hundreds
coming
and
going
and
had
their
home
or
nest
in
the
rock
a
few
feet
above
his
head
he
got
up
and
climbing
from
his
mother
knee
to
her
shoulder
and
standing
on
it
he
looked
into
the
crevice
into
which
the
bees
were
streaming
and
saw
their
nest
full
of
clusters
of
small
round
objects
that
looked
like
white
berries
then
he
came
down
and
told
her
what
he
had
seen
and
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
and
when
she
answered
that
the
little
round
objects
he
had
seen
were
cells
full
of
purple
honey
that
tasted
sweet
and
salt
he
wanted
her
to
get
him
some
not
now
not
she
replied
for
now
you
love
me
and
are
contented
to
be
with
me
and
you
are
my
own
darling
child
when
you
are
naughty
and
try
to
grieve
me
all
you
can
and
would
like
to
go
away
and
never
see
me
more
you
shall
taste
the
purple
honey
he
looked
up
into
her
face
wondering
and
troubled
at
her
words
and
she
smiled
down
so
sweetly
on
his
upturned
face
looking
very
beautiful
and
tender
that
it
almost
made
him
cry
to
think
how
wilful
and
passionate
he
had
been
and
climbing
on
to
her
knees
he
put
his
little
face
against
her
cheek
illustration
then
while
he
was
still
caressing
her
light
tripping
steps
were
heard
over
the
stony
path
and
through
the
bushes
came
two
beautiful
wild
animals
a
doe
with
her
fawn
martin
had
often
seen
the
wild
deer
on
the
plains
but
always
at
a
great
distance
and
running
now
that
he
had
them
standing
before
him
he
could
see
just
what
they
were
like
and
of
all
the
creatures
he
had
ever
looked
on
they
were
undoubtedly
the
most
lovely
they
were
of
a
slim
shape
and
of
a
very
bright
reddish
the
young
one
with
dappled
sides
and
both
had
large
ears
which
they
held
up
as
if
listening
while
they
gazed
fixedly
at
martin
face
with
their
large
dark
soft
eyes
enchanted
with
the
sight
of
them
he
slipped
down
from
his
mother
lap
and
stretched
out
his
arms
towards
them
and
the
doe
coming
a
little
nearer
timidly
smelt
at
his
hand
then
licked
it
with
her
long
pink
tongue
in
a
few
minutes
the
doe
and
fawn
went
away
and
they
saw
them
no
more
but
they
left
martin
with
a
heart
filled
with
happy
excitement
and
they
were
but
the
first
of
many
strange
and
beautiful
wild
animals
he
was
now
made
acquainted
with
so
that
for
days
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
wished
for
nothing
better
but
one
day
when
she
had
taken
him
a
good
way
up
on
the
hillside
martin
suddenly
recognized
a
huge
rocky
precipice
before
him
as
the
one
up
which
she
had
taken
him
and
from
the
top
of
which
he
had
seen
the
great
blue
water
instantly
he
demanded
to
be
taken
up
again
and
when
she
refused
he
rebelled
against
her
and
was
first
passionate
and
then
sullen
finding
that
he
would
not
listen
to
anything
she
could
say
she
sat
down
on
a
rock
and
left
him
to
himself
he
could
not
climb
up
that
precipice
and
so
he
rambled
away
to
some
distance
thinking
to
hide
himself
from
her
because
he
thought
her
unreasonable
and
unkind
not
to
allow
him
to
see
the
blue
water
once
more
but
presently
he
caught
sight
of
a
snake
lying
motionless
on
a
bed
of
moss
at
the
foot
of
a
rock
with
the
sun
on
it
lighting
up
its
polished
scales
so
that
they
shone
like
gems
or
coloured
glass
resting
his
elbows
on
the
stone
and
holding
his
face
between
his
hands
he
fell
to
watching
the
snake
for
though
it
seemed
fast
asleep
in
the
sun
its
eyes
were
wide
open
all
at
once
he
felt
his
mother
hand
on
his
head
martin
she
said
would
you
like
to
know
what
the
snake
feels
when
it
lies
with
eyes
open
in
the
bright
hot
sun
shall
i
make
you
feel
just
how
he
feels
yes
said
martin
eagerly
forgetting
his
quarrel
with
her
then
taking
him
up
in
her
strong
arms
she
walked
rapidly
away
and
brought
him
to
that
very
spot
where
he
had
seen
the
doe
and
fawn
she
sat
him
down
and
instantly
his
ears
were
filled
with
the
murmur
of
the
bees
and
in
a
moment
she
put
her
hand
in
the
crevice
and
pulled
out
a
cluster
of
white
cells
and
gave
them
to
martin
breaking
one
of
the
cells
he
saw
that
it
was
full
of
thick
honey
of
a
violet
colour
and
tasting
it
he
found
it
was
like
very
sweet
honey
in
which
a
little
salt
had
been
mixed
he
liked
it
and
he
did
like
it
still
it
was
not
the
same
in
all
the
cells
in
some
it
was
scarcely
salt
at
all
and
he
began
to
suck
the
honey
of
cell
after
cell
trying
to
find
one
that
was
not
salt
and
by
and
by
he
dropped
the
cluster
of
cells
from
his
hand
and
stooping
to
pick
it
up
forgot
to
do
so
and
laying
his
head
down
and
stretching
himself
out
on
the
mossy
ground
looked
up
into
his
mother
face
with
drowsy
happy
eyes
how
sweet
it
seemed
lying
there
in
the
sun
with
the
sun
shining
right
into
his
eyes
and
filling
his
whole
being
with
its
delicious
heat
he
wished
for
nothing
now
not
even
for
the
sight
of
new
wonderful
things
he
forgot
the
blue
water
the
strange
beautiful
wild
animals
and
his
only
thought
if
he
had
a
thought
was
that
it
was
very
nice
to
lie
there
not
sleeping
but
feeling
the
sun
in
him
and
seeing
it
above
him
and
seeing
all
things
the
blue
sky
the
grey
rocks
and
green
bushes
and
moss
and
the
woman
in
her
green
dress
and
her
loose
black
hair
and
hearing
too
the
soft
low
continuous
murmur
of
the
yellow
bees
for
hours
he
lay
there
in
that
drowsy
condition
his
mother
keeping
watch
over
him
and
when
it
passed
off
and
he
got
up
again
his
temper
appeared
changed
he
was
more
gentle
and
affectionate
with
his
mother
and
obeyed
her
every
wish
and
when
in
his
rambles
on
the
hill
he
found
a
snake
lying
in
the
sun
he
would
steal
softly
near
it
and
watch
it
steadily
for
a
long
time
half
wishing
to
taste
that
strange
purple
honey
again
so
that
he
might
lie
again
in
the
sun
feeling
what
the
snake
feels
but
there
were
more
wonderful
things
yet
for
martin
to
see
and
know
in
the
hills
so
that
in
a
little
while
he
ceased
to
have
that
desire
chapter
xv
martin
eyes
are
opened
illustration
one
morning
when
they
went
up
into
a
wild
rocky
place
very
high
up
on
the
hillside
a
number
of
big
birds
were
seen
coming
over
the
mountain
at
a
great
height
in
the
air
travelling
in
a
northerly
direction
they
were
big
hawks
almost
as
big
as
eagles
with
very
broad
rounded
wings
and
instead
of
travelling
straight
like
other
birds
they
moved
in
wide
circles
so
that
they
progressed
very
slowly
they
sat
down
on
a
stone
to
watch
the
birds
and
whenever
one
flying
lower
than
the
others
came
pretty
near
them
martin
gazed
delightedly
at
it
and
wished
it
would
come
still
nearer
so
that
he
might
see
it
better
then
the
woman
stood
up
on
the
stone
and
gazing
skywards
and
throwing
up
her
arms
she
uttered
a
long
call
and
the
birds
began
to
come
lower
and
lower
down
still
sweeping
round
in
wide
circles
and
by
and
by
one
came
quite
down
and
pitched
on
a
stone
a
few
yards
from
them
then
another
came
and
lighted
on
another
stone
then
another
and
others
followed
until
they
were
all
round
him
in
scores
sitting
on
the
rocks
great
brown
birds
with
black
bars
on
their
wings
and
tails
and
breasts
with
spots
and
stripes
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
those
hawks
with
their
blue
hooked
beaks
and
dark
piercing
eyes
sitting
in
numbers
on
the
rocks
and
others
and
still
others
dropping
down
from
the
sky
to
increase
the
gathering
then
the
woman
sat
down
by
martin
side
and
after
a
while
one
of
the
hawks
spread
his
great
wings
and
rose
up
into
the
air
to
resume
his
flight
after
an
interval
of
a
minute
or
so
another
rose
then
another
but
it
was
an
hour
before
they
were
all
gone
o
the
dear
birds
they
are
all
gone
cried
martin
mother
where
are
they
going
she
told
him
of
a
land
in
the
south
from
which
when
autumn
comes
the
birds
migrate
north
to
a
warmer
country
hundreds
of
leagues
away
and
that
birds
of
all
kinds
were
now
travelling
north
and
would
be
travelling
through
the
sky
above
them
for
many
days
to
come
martin
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
said
he
could
see
no
birds
now
that
the
buzzards
were
all
gone
i
can
see
them
she
returned
looking
up
and
glancing
about
the
sky
o
mother
i
wish
i
could
see
them
he
cried
why
ca
i
see
them
when
you
can
because
your
eyes
are
not
like
mine
look
can
you
see
this
and
she
held
up
a
small
stone
phial
which
she
took
from
her
bosom
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
unstopped
and
smelt
at
it
is
it
honey
can
i
taste
it
he
asked
she
laughed
it
is
better
than
honey
but
you
ca
eat
it
she
said
do
you
remember
how
the
honey
made
you
feel
like
a
snake
this
would
make
you
see
what
i
see
if
i
put
some
of
it
on
your
eyes
he
begged
her
to
do
so
and
she
consenting
poured
a
little
into
the
palm
of
her
hand
it
was
thick
and
white
as
milk
then
taking
some
on
her
finger
tip
she
made
him
hold
his
eyes
wide
open
while
she
rubbed
it
on
the
it
made
his
eyes
smart
and
everything
at
first
looked
like
a
blue
mist
when
he
tried
to
see
then
slowly
the
mist
faded
away
and
the
air
had
a
new
marvellous
clearness
and
when
he
looked
away
over
the
plain
beneath
them
he
shouted
for
joy
so
far
could
he
see
and
so
distinct
did
distant
objects
appear
at
one
point
where
nothing
but
the
grey
haze
that
obscured
the
distance
had
been
visible
a
herd
of
wild
cattle
now
appeared
scattered
about
some
grazing
others
lying
down
ruminating
and
in
the
midst
of
the
herd
a
very
bull
was
standing
o
mother
do
you
see
that
bull
cried
martin
in
delight
yes
i
see
him
she
returned
sometimes
he
brings
his
herd
to
feed
on
the
hillside
and
when
i
see
him
here
another
time
i
shall
take
you
to
him
and
put
you
on
his
back
but
look
now
at
the
sky
martin
he
looked
up
and
was
astonished
to
see
numbers
of
great
birds
flying
north
where
no
birds
had
appeared
before
they
were
miles
high
and
invisible
to
ordinary
sight
but
he
could
see
them
so
distinctly
their
shape
and
colours
that
all
the
birds
he
knew
were
easily
recognized
there
were
swans
shining
white
with
black
heads
and
necks
flying
in
flocks
and
spoonbills
and
flamingoes
with
scarlet
wings
tipped
with
black
and
ibises
and
ducks
of
different
colours
and
many
other
birds
both
water
and
land
appeared
flock
after
flock
all
flying
as
fast
as
their
wings
could
bear
them
towards
the
north
he
continued
watching
them
until
it
was
past
noon
and
then
he
saw
fewer
and
fewer
only
very
big
birds
appearing
and
then
these
were
seen
less
and
less
until
there
were
none
then
he
turned
his
eyes
on
the
plain
and
tried
to
find
the
herd
of
wild
cattle
but
they
were
no
longer
visible
it
was
as
he
had
seen
it
in
the
morning
with
the
pale
blue
haze
over
all
the
distant
earth
he
was
told
that
the
power
to
see
all
distant
things
with
a
vision
equal
to
his
was
now
exhausted
and
when
he
grieved
at
the
loss
she
comforted
him
with
the
promise
that
it
would
be
renewed
at
some
other
time
illustration
now
one
day
when
they
were
out
together
martin
was
greatly
surprised
and
disturbed
at
a
change
in
his
mother
when
he
spoke
to
her
she
was
silent
and
drawing
a
little
away
he
looked
at
her
with
a
fear
which
increased
to
a
kind
of
terror
so
strangely
altered
did
she
seem
standing
motionless
gazing
fixedly
with
eyes
at
the
plain
beneath
them
her
whole
face
white
and
drawn
with
a
look
of
rage
he
had
an
impulse
to
fly
from
her
and
hide
himself
in
some
hole
in
the
rocks
from
the
sight
of
that
pale
wrathful
face
but
when
he
looked
round
him
he
was
afraid
to
move
from
her
for
the
hill
itself
seemed
changed
and
now
looked
black
and
angry
even
as
she
did
the
ground
he
stood
on
the
grey
old
stones
covered
with
and
yellow
lichen
and
pretty
flowery
creeping
plants
so
beautiful
to
look
at
in
the
bright
sunlight
a
few
moments
ago
now
were
covered
with
a
dull
mist
which
appeared
to
be
rising
from
them
making
the
air
around
them
dark
and
strange
and
the
air
too
had
become
sultry
and
close
and
the
sky
was
growing
dark
above
them
then
suddenly
remembering
all
her
love
and
kindness
he
flew
to
her
and
clinging
to
her
dress
sobbed
out
o
mother
mother
what
is
it
she
put
her
hand
on
him
then
drew
him
up
to
her
side
with
his
feet
on
the
stone
she
was
standing
by
would
you
like
to
see
what
i
see
martin
she
asked
and
taking
the
phial
from
her
bosom
she
rubbed
the
white
thick
liquid
on
his
and
in
a
little
while
when
the
mistiness
passed
off
she
pointed
with
her
hand
and
told
him
to
look
there
he
looked
and
as
on
the
former
occasion
all
distant
things
were
clearly
visible
for
although
that
mist
and
blackness
given
off
by
the
hill
had
wrapped
them
round
so
that
they
seemed
to
be
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
black
cloud
yet
away
on
the
plain
beneath
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
all
that
was
there
could
be
seen
by
him
where
he
had
once
seen
a
herd
of
wild
cattle
he
now
saw
mounted
men
to
the
number
of
about
a
dozen
slowly
riding
towards
the
hill
and
though
they
were
miles
away
he
could
see
them
very
distinctly
they
were
dark
men
strangely
dressed
some
with
cloaks
with
broad
stripes
others
in
a
scarlet
uniform
and
they
wore
scarlet
caps
some
carried
lances
others
carbines
and
they
all
wore
swords
he
could
see
the
steel
scabbards
shining
in
the
sun
as
he
watched
them
they
drew
rein
and
some
of
them
got
off
their
horses
and
they
stood
for
some
time
as
if
talking
excitedly
pointing
towards
the
hill
and
using
emphatic
gestures
what
were
they
talking
about
so
excitedly
thought
martin
he
wanted
to
know
and
he
would
have
asked
her
but
when
he
looked
up
at
her
she
was
still
gazing
fixedly
at
them
with
the
same
pale
face
and
terrible
stern
expression
and
he
could
but
dimly
see
her
face
in
that
black
cloud
which
had
closed
around
them
he
trembled
with
fear
and
could
only
murmur
mother
mother
then
her
arm
was
put
round
him
and
she
drew
him
close
against
her
side
and
at
that
moment
o
how
terrible
it
was
the
black
cloud
and
the
whole
universe
was
lit
up
with
a
sudden
flash
that
seemed
to
blind
and
scorch
him
and
the
hill
and
the
world
was
shaken
and
seemed
to
be
shattered
by
an
awful
thunder
crash
it
was
more
than
he
could
endure
he
ceased
to
feel
or
know
anything
and
was
like
one
dead
and
when
he
came
to
himself
and
opened
his
eyes
he
was
lying
in
her
lap
with
her
face
smiling
very
tenderly
bending
over
him
o
poor
little
martin
she
said
what
a
poor
weak
little
boy
you
are
to
lose
your
senses
at
the
lightning
and
thunder
i
was
angry
when
i
saw
them
coming
to
the
hill
for
they
are
wicked
cruel
men
stained
with
blood
and
i
made
the
storm
to
drive
them
away
they
are
gone
and
the
storm
is
over
now
and
it
is
late
come
let
us
go
to
our
cave
and
she
took
him
up
and
carried
him
in
her
arms
chapter
xvi
the
people
of
the
mist
when
martin
first
came
to
the
hills
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
long
hot
dry
summer
of
that
distant
land
it
was
autumn
now
and
the
autumn
was
like
a
second
summer
only
not
so
hot
and
dry
as
the
first
but
sometimes
at
this
season
a
wet
mist
came
up
from
the
sea
by
night
and
spread
over
all
the
country
covering
it
like
a
cloud
to
a
soaring
bird
looking
down
from
the
sky
it
must
have
appeared
like
another
sea
of
a
pale
or
pearly
grey
colour
with
the
hills
rising
like
islands
from
it
when
the
sun
rose
in
the
morning
if
the
sky
was
clear
so
that
it
could
shine
then
the
would
drift
and
break
up
and
melt
away
or
float
up
in
the
form
of
thin
white
clouds
now
whenever
this
was
out
over
the
world
the
lady
of
the
hills
without
coming
out
of
her
chamber
knew
of
it
and
she
would
prevent
martin
from
leaving
the
bed
and
going
out
he
loved
to
be
out
on
the
to
watch
the
sun
come
up
and
she
would
say
to
him
you
can
not
see
the
sun
because
of
the
mist
and
it
is
cold
and
wet
on
the
hill
wait
until
the
mist
has
gone
and
then
you
shall
go
out
but
now
a
new
idea
came
into
her
mind
she
had
succeeded
in
making
him
happy
during
the
last
few
days
but
she
wished
to
do
more
she
wished
to
make
him
fear
and
hate
the
sea
so
that
he
would
never
grow
discontented
with
his
life
on
the
hills
nor
wish
to
leave
her
so
now
one
morning
when
the
mist
was
out
over
the
land
she
said
to
martin
when
he
woke
get
up
and
go
out
on
to
the
hill
and
see
the
mist
and
when
you
feel
its
coldness
and
taste
its
salt
on
your
lips
and
see
how
it
dims
and
saddens
the
earth
you
will
know
better
than
to
wish
for
that
great
water
it
comes
from
so
martin
got
up
and
went
out
on
the
hill
and
it
was
as
she
had
said
there
was
no
blue
sky
above
no
wide
green
earth
before
him
the
mist
had
blotted
all
out
he
could
hardly
see
the
rocks
and
bushes
a
dozen
yards
from
him
the
leaves
and
flowers
were
heavy
laden
with
the
grey
wet
and
it
felt
clammy
and
cold
on
his
face
and
he
tasted
its
salt
on
his
lips
it
seemed
thickest
and
darkest
when
he
looked
down
and
lightest
when
he
looked
up
and
the
lightness
led
him
to
climb
up
among
the
dripping
slippery
rocks
and
slipping
and
stumbling
he
went
on
and
on
the
light
increasing
as
he
went
until
at
last
to
his
delight
he
got
above
the
mist
there
was
an
immense
crag
there
which
stood
boldly
up
on
the
hillside
and
on
to
this
he
managed
to
climb
and
standing
on
it
he
looked
down
upon
that
vast
moving
sea
of
grey
mist
that
covered
the
earth
and
saw
the
sun
a
large
crimson
disc
rising
from
it
it
was
a
great
thing
to
see
and
made
him
cry
out
aloud
for
joy
and
then
as
the
sun
rose
higher
into
the
pure
blue
sky
the
grey
mist
changed
to
silvery
white
and
the
white
changed
in
places
to
shining
gold
and
it
drifted
faster
and
faster
away
before
the
sun
and
began
to
break
up
and
when
a
cloud
of
mist
swept
by
the
rock
on
which
he
stood
it
beat
like
a
fine
rain
upon
his
face
and
covered
his
bright
clothes
with
a
grey
beady
moisture
now
looking
abroad
over
the
earth
it
appeared
to
martin
that
the
thousands
and
tens
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
fragments
of
mist
had
the
shapes
of
men
and
were
like
an
innumerable
multitude
of
gigantic
men
with
shining
white
faces
and
shining
golden
hair
and
long
robes
of
a
pearly
grey
colour
that
trailed
on
the
earth
as
they
moved
they
were
like
a
vast
army
covering
the
whole
earth
all
with
their
faces
set
towards
the
west
all
moving
swiftly
and
smoothly
on
towards
the
west
and
he
saw
that
every
one
held
his
robes
to
his
breast
with
his
left
hand
and
that
in
his
right
hand
raised
to
the
level
of
his
head
he
carried
a
strange
object
this
object
was
a
shell
a
big
of
a
golden
yellow
colour
with
curved
pink
lips
and
very
soon
one
of
the
mist
people
came
near
him
and
as
he
passed
by
the
rock
he
held
the
shell
to
martin
ear
and
it
sounded
in
his
ear
a
low
deep
murmur
as
of
waves
breaking
on
a
long
shingled
beach
and
martin
knew
though
no
word
was
spoken
to
him
that
it
was
the
sound
of
the
sea
and
tears
of
delight
came
to
his
eyes
and
at
the
same
time
his
heart
was
sick
and
sad
with
longing
for
the
sea
illustration
again
and
again
until
the
whole
vast
multitude
of
the
mist
people
had
gone
by
a
shell
was
held
to
his
ear
and
when
they
were
all
gone
when
he
had
watched
them
fade
like
a
white
cloud
over
the
plain
and
float
away
and
disappear
in
the
blue
sky
he
sat
down
on
the
rock
and
cried
with
the
desire
that
was
in
him
when
his
mother
found
him
with
traces
of
tears
on
his
cheeks
and
he
was
silent
when
she
spoke
to
him
and
had
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
as
if
they
were
gazing
at
some
distant
object
she
was
angrier
than
ever
with
the
sea
for
she
knew
that
the
thought
of
it
had
returned
to
him
and
that
it
would
be
harder
than
ever
to
keep
him
one
morning
on
waking
he
found
her
still
asleep
although
the
traces
of
tears
on
her
cheeks
showed
that
she
had
been
awake
and
crying
during
the
night
ah
now
i
know
why
she
cries
every
morning
thought
martin
it
is
because
i
must
go
away
and
leave
her
here
alone
on
the
hills
he
was
out
of
her
arms
and
dressed
in
a
very
few
moments
moving
very
softly
lest
she
should
wake
but
though
he
knew
that
if
she
awoke
she
would
not
let
him
go
he
could
not
leave
her
without
saying
goodbye
and
so
coming
near
he
stooped
over
her
and
very
gently
kissed
her
soft
cheek
and
sweet
mouth
and
murmured
sweet
mother
then
very
cautiously
like
a
shy
little
wild
animal
he
stole
out
of
the
cavern
once
outside
in
the
early
morning
light
he
started
running
as
fast
as
he
could
jumping
from
stone
to
stone
in
the
rough
places
and
scrambling
through
the
bushes
and
creepers
until
hot
and
panting
he
arrived
down
at
the
very
foot
of
the
hill
then
it
was
easier
walking
and
he
went
on
a
little
until
he
heard
a
voice
crying
martin
martin
and
looking
back
he
saw
the
lady
of
the
hills
standing
on
a
great
stone
near
the
foot
of
the
mountain
gazing
sadly
after
him
martin
oh
my
child
come
back
to
me
she
called
stretching
out
her
arms
towards
him
oh
martin
i
can
not
leave
the
hills
to
follow
you
and
shield
you
from
harm
and
save
you
from
death
where
will
you
go
oh
me
what
shall
i
do
without
you
for
a
little
while
he
stood
still
listening
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
her
words
and
wavering
in
his
mind
but
very
soon
he
thought
of
the
great
blue
water
once
more
and
could
not
go
back
but
began
to
run
again
and
went
on
and
on
for
a
long
distance
before
stopping
to
rest
then
he
looked
back
but
he
could
no
longer
see
her
form
standing
there
on
the
stone
all
that
day
he
journeyed
on
towards
the
ocean
over
a
great
plain
there
was
no
trees
and
no
rocks
nor
hills
only
grass
on
the
level
earth
in
some
places
so
tall
that
the
spikes
looking
like
great
white
ostrich
plumes
waved
high
above
his
head
but
it
was
easy
walking
as
the
grass
grew
in
tussocks
or
bunches
and
underneath
the
ground
was
bare
and
smooth
so
that
he
could
walk
easily
between
the
bunches
he
wondered
that
he
did
not
get
to
the
sea
but
it
was
still
far
off
and
so
the
long
summer
day
wore
to
an
end
and
he
was
so
tired
that
he
could
scarcely
lift
his
legs
to
walk
then
as
he
went
slowly
on
in
the
fading
light
where
the
grass
was
short
and
the
evening
primroses
were
opening
and
filling
the
desert
air
with
their
sweet
perfume
he
all
at
once
saw
a
little
grey
old
man
not
above
six
inches
in
height
standing
on
the
ground
right
before
him
and
staring
fixedly
at
him
with
great
round
yellow
eyes
illustration
you
bad
boy
exclaimed
this
curious
little
old
man
whereupon
martin
stopped
in
his
walk
and
stood
still
gazing
in
the
greatest
surprise
at
him
you
bad
boy
repeated
the
strange
little
man
the
more
martin
stared
at
him
the
harder
he
stared
back
at
martin
always
with
the
same
unbending
severity
in
his
small
round
grey
face
he
began
to
feel
a
little
afraid
and
was
almost
inclined
to
run
away
then
he
thought
it
would
be
funny
to
run
from
such
a
very
small
man
as
this
so
he
stared
bravely
back
once
more
and
cried
out
go
away
you
bad
boy
answered
the
little
grey
man
without
moving
perhaps
he
deaf
just
like
that
other
old
man
said
martin
to
himself
and
throwing
out
his
arms
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
go
away
and
away
with
a
scream
he
went
for
it
was
only
a
little
grey
burrowing
owl
after
all
martin
laughed
a
little
at
his
own
foolishness
in
mistaking
that
common
bird
he
was
accustomed
to
see
every
day
for
a
little
old
man
feeling
very
tired
he
sat
down
to
rest
and
just
where
he
sat
grew
a
plant
with
long
white
flowers
like
tall
thin
goblets
in
shape
sitting
on
the
grass
he
could
see
right
into
one
of
the
and
presently
he
noticed
a
little
old
grey
shrivelled
woman
in
it
very
very
small
for
she
was
not
longer
than
the
nail
of
his
little
finger
she
wore
a
grey
shawl
that
dragged
behind
her
and
kept
getting
under
her
feet
and
tripping
her
up
she
was
most
active
whisking
about
this
way
and
that
inside
the
flower
and
at
intervals
she
turned
to
stare
at
martin
who
kept
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
watch
her
until
his
face
nearly
touched
the
flower
and
whenever
she
looked
at
him
she
wore
an
exceedingly
severe
expression
on
her
small
countenance
it
seemed
to
martin
that
she
was
very
angry
with
him
for
some
reason
then
she
would
turn
her
back
on
him
and
tumble
about
in
the
tube
of
the
flower
and
gathering
up
the
ends
of
her
shawl
in
her
arms
begin
dusting
with
great
energy
then
hurrying
out
once
more
she
would
shake
the
dust
from
her
big
funny
shawl
in
his
eyes
at
last
he
carefully
raised
a
hand
and
was
just
going
to
take
hold
of
the
queer
little
old
dame
with
his
forefinger
and
thumb
when
up
she
flew
it
was
only
a
small
grey
twilight
moth
very
much
puzzled
and
confused
and
perhaps
a
little
frightened
at
these
curious
deceptions
he
laid
himself
down
on
the
grass
and
shut
his
eyes
so
as
to
go
to
sleep
but
no
sooner
had
he
shut
his
eyes
than
he
heard
a
soft
soft
little
voice
calling
martin
martin
he
started
up
and
listened
it
was
only
a
field
cricket
singing
in
the
grass
but
often
as
he
lay
down
and
closed
his
eyes
the
small
voice
called
again
plainly
as
possible
and
oh
so
sadly
martin
martin
it
made
him
remember
his
beautiful
mother
now
perhaps
crying
alone
in
the
cave
on
the
mountain
no
little
martin
resting
on
her
bosom
and
he
cried
to
think
of
it
and
still
the
small
voice
went
on
calling
martin
martin
sadder
than
ever
until
unable
to
endure
it
longer
he
jumped
up
and
ran
away
a
good
distance
and
at
last
too
tired
to
go
any
further
he
crept
into
a
tussock
of
tall
grass
and
went
to
sleep
chapter
xvii
the
old
man
of
the
sea
next
day
martin
journeyed
on
in
the
old
way
jumping
up
and
taking
a
good
long
run
then
dropping
into
a
trot
then
a
walk
and
finally
sitting
down
to
rest
then
up
again
and
another
run
and
so
on
but
although
feeling
hungry
and
thirsty
he
was
so
full
of
the
thought
of
the
great
blue
water
he
was
going
to
see
so
eager
to
look
upon
it
at
last
after
wishing
for
it
so
long
that
he
hardly
gave
himself
any
time
to
hunt
for
food
nor
did
he
think
of
his
mother
of
the
hills
alone
and
grieving
at
his
loss
so
excited
was
he
at
the
prospect
of
what
lay
before
him
a
little
past
noon
he
began
to
hear
a
low
murmuring
sound
that
seemed
in
the
earth
beneath
him
and
all
about
him
and
in
the
air
above
him
but
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
sound
of
the
sea
at
length
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
earth
rose
up
in
long
ridges
of
yellow
sand
on
which
nothing
grew
but
scattered
tufts
of
stiff
yellow
grass
as
he
toiled
over
the
loose
sand
sometimes
sinking
in
it
the
curious
deep
murmuring
sound
he
had
heard
for
so
long
grew
louder
and
louder
until
it
was
like
the
sound
of
a
mighty
wind
in
a
wood
but
deeper
and
hoarser
rising
and
falling
and
at
intervals
broken
by
great
throbs
as
of
thunder
echoed
and
among
the
distant
hills
at
length
he
had
toiled
over
the
last
ridge
of
sand
and
then
all
at
once
the
world
his
world
of
solid
earth
at
all
events
came
to
an
abrupt
end
for
no
more
ground
on
which
to
set
a
foot
was
before
him
but
only
the
ocean
that
ocean
which
he
had
wanted
so
badly
and
had
loved
at
a
distance
more
than
the
plains
and
hills
and
all
they
contained
to
delight
him
how
wide
how
vast
it
was
stretching
away
to
where
it
melted
into
the
low
sky
its
immense
surface
broken
into
ten
thousand
thousand
waves
lit
with
white
crests
that
came
in
sight
and
vanished
like
lightning
flashes
how
tremendous
how
terrible
it
was
in
its
agitation
o
the
world
had
nothing
to
compare
with
it
nothing
to
hold
his
heart
after
it
and
it
was
well
that
the
earth
was
silent
that
it
only
gazed
upon
it
with
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
listening
day
and
night
for
ever
to
the
great
voice
of
the
sea
only
by
lying
flat
on
his
chest
could
martin
look
down
over
the
edge
of
the
awful
cliff
which
is
one
of
the
highest
in
the
world
and
then
the
sight
of
the
sea
swirling
and
beating
at
the
foot
of
that
stupendous
black
precipice
sending
up
great
clouds
of
spray
in
its
fury
made
him
shudder
it
was
so
awful
to
look
upon
but
he
could
not
stir
from
that
spot
there
he
stayed
lying
flat
on
his
chest
gazing
and
gazing
feeling
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
forgetful
of
the
beautiful
woman
he
had
called
mother
and
of
everything
besides
and
as
he
gazed
little
by
little
that
great
tumult
of
the
waves
grew
less
they
no
longer
lifted
themselves
up
wave
following
wave
to
beat
upon
the
cliff
and
make
it
tremble
but
sank
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
drew
off
from
the
precipice
leaving
at
its
foot
a
long
narrow
strip
of
sand
and
shingle
exposed
to
sight
a
solemn
calm
fell
upon
the
waste
of
waters
only
near
the
shore
it
continued
to
move
a
little
rising
and
falling
like
the
chest
of
a
sleeping
giant
while
along
the
margin
small
waves
continued
to
form
and
break
in
white
foam
on
the
shingle
with
a
perpetual
low
moaning
sound
further
out
it
was
quite
calm
its
surface
everywhere
flushed
with
changing
violet
green
and
rosy
tints
in
a
little
while
these
lovely
colours
faded
as
from
a
sunset
cloud
and
it
was
all
deep
dark
blue
for
the
sun
had
gone
and
the
shadows
of
evening
were
over
land
and
sea
then
martin
his
little
heart
filled
with
a
great
awe
and
a
great
joy
crept
away
a
few
yards
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
coiled
himself
up
to
sleep
in
a
hollow
in
the
soft
warm
sand
on
the
following
morning
after
satisfying
his
hunger
and
thirst
with
some
roots
which
he
had
not
to
go
very
far
to
find
he
returned
to
watch
the
sea
once
more
and
there
he
remained
never
removing
his
eyes
from
the
wonderful
scene
until
the
sun
was
directly
over
his
head
then
when
the
sea
was
calm
once
more
he
got
up
and
started
to
walk
along
the
cliff
keeping
close
to
the
edge
occasionally
stopping
to
lie
down
on
his
chest
and
peer
over
he
went
on
and
on
for
hours
until
the
afternoon
tide
once
more
covered
the
strip
of
shingled
beach
and
the
waves
rising
high
began
to
beat
with
a
sound
like
thunder
against
the
tremendous
cliff
making
the
earth
tremble
under
him
at
length
he
came
to
a
spot
where
there
was
a
great
gap
in
the
line
of
the
cliff
where
in
past
times
a
portion
of
it
had
tumbled
down
and
the
stupendous
masses
of
rock
had
rolled
far
out
into
the
sea
and
now
formed
islands
of
black
jagged
rock
standing
high
above
the
water
here
among
the
rocks
the
sea
boiled
and
roared
its
loudest
churning
its
waters
into
masses
of
white
froth
here
a
fresh
wonder
met
his
sight
a
number
of
big
animals
unlike
any
creature
he
had
ever
seen
before
were
lying
prone
on
the
rocks
just
out
of
the
reach
of
the
waves
that
beat
round
them
at
first
they
looked
like
cows
then
he
saw
that
they
had
neither
horns
nor
legs
that
their
heads
were
like
dog
but
without
ears
and
that
they
had
two
great
feet
on
their
chests
with
which
they
walked
or
crawled
upon
the
rocks
whenever
a
wave
broke
on
them
causing
them
to
move
a
little
higher
illustration
they
were
a
very
big
sort
of
seal
but
martin
had
never
heard
of
such
a
creature
and
being
anxious
to
look
more
closely
at
them
he
went
into
the
gap
and
began
cautiously
climbing
down
over
the
broken
masses
of
rock
and
clay
until
he
got
quite
near
the
sea
lying
there
on
a
flat
rock
he
became
absorbed
in
watching
these
strange
legless
cattle
of
the
sea
for
he
now
had
them
near
and
they
could
see
him
and
occasionally
one
would
lift
its
head
and
gaze
earnestly
at
him
out
of
large
dark
eyes
that
were
soft
and
beautiful
like
the
eyes
of
the
doe
that
came
to
him
on
the
hills
o
how
glad
he
was
to
know
that
the
sea
the
mighty
waters
roaring
so
loud
as
if
in
wrath
had
its
big
beasts
too
for
him
to
love
like
the
hills
and
plains
with
their
cattle
and
deer
and
horses
but
the
tide
was
still
rising
and
very
soon
the
biggest
waves
began
to
come
quite
over
the
rocks
rolling
the
big
beasts
over
and
even
washing
them
off
and
it
angered
them
when
the
waves
struck
them
and
they
roared
aloud
and
by
and
by
they
began
to
go
away
some
disappearing
beneath
the
water
others
with
heads
above
the
surface
swimming
away
out
into
the
open
sea
until
all
were
gone
martin
was
sorry
to
lose
them
but
the
sight
of
the
sea
tumbling
and
foaming
on
the
rocks
still
held
him
there
until
all
the
rocks
but
one
had
been
covered
by
the
waters
and
this
one
was
a
great
black
jagged
rock
close
to
the
shore
not
above
twenty
or
thirty
yards
from
him
against
this
mass
of
rock
the
waves
continued
to
dash
themselves
with
a
mighty
noise
sending
up
a
cloud
of
white
foam
and
spray
at
every
blow
the
sight
and
sound
fascinated
him
the
sea
appeared
to
be
talking
whispering
and
murmuring
and
crying
out
aloud
to
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
actually
began
trying
to
make
out
what
it
was
saying
then
up
would
come
a
great
green
wave
rushing
and
moaning
to
dash
itself
to
pieces
right
before
his
face
and
each
time
it
broke
against
the
rock
and
rose
high
up
it
took
a
fantastic
shape
that
began
to
look
more
and
more
the
shape
of
a
man
yes
it
was
unmistakably
like
a
monstrous
grey
old
man
with
a
vast
beard
and
a
world
of
disordered
white
hair
floating
over
and
around
its
head
at
all
events
it
was
white
for
a
moment
then
it
looked
green
a
great
green
beard
which
the
old
man
took
with
his
two
hands
and
twisted
just
as
a
washerwoman
twists
a
blanket
or
counterpane
so
as
to
wring
the
water
out
of
it
martin
stared
at
this
strange
uncouth
visitor
from
the
sea
while
he
in
turn
leaning
over
the
rock
stared
back
into
martin
face
with
his
immense
fishy
eyes
every
time
a
fresh
wave
broke
over
him
lifting
up
his
hair
and
garments
which
were
of
brown
seaweed
and
all
rags
and
tatters
it
seemed
to
annoy
him
somewhat
but
he
never
stirred
and
when
the
wave
retired
he
would
wring
the
water
out
once
more
and
blow
a
cloud
of
from
his
beard
at
length
holding
out
his
mighty
arms
towards
martin
he
opened
his
great
mouth
and
burst
into
a
hoarse
laugh
which
sounded
like
the
deep
cries
of
the
big
gulls
still
martin
did
not
feel
at
all
afraid
of
him
for
he
looked
and
friendly
who
are

shouted
martin
at
last

asked
martin
ho
ho
ho
laughed
the
monster
that
a
good
un
little
martin
do
i
like
it
well
it
better
than
being
a
sailor
man
in
a
ship
i
can
tell
that
were
a
hard
life
with
nothing
good
except
perhaps
the
baccy
i
were
very
fond
of
baccy
once
before
the
sea
put
out
my
pipe
likewise
of
rum
many
the
time
i
been
picked
up
on
shore
that
drunk
martin
you
would
believe
it
i
were
that
fond
of
rum
sometimes
down
here
when
i
remember
how
good
it
tasted
i
open
my
mouth
wide
and
takes
down
a
big
gulp
of
sea
water
enough
to
fill
a
hogshead
then
i
comes
up
and
blows
it
all
out
again
just
like
a
old
grampus
and
having
said
this
he
opened
his
vast
cavernous
mouth
and
roared
out
his
hoarse
ho
ho
ho
louder
than
before
and
at
the
same
time
he
rose
up
higher
above
the
water
and
the
black
rock
he
had
been
leaning
on
until
he
stood
like
a
stupendous
tower
above
martin
a
tower
of
water
and
spray
and
white
froth
and
brown
seaweed
then
he
slowly
fell
backwards
out
upon
the
sea
and
falling
upon
the
sea
caused
so
mighty
a
wave
that
it
went
high
over
the
black
rock
and
washed
the
face
of
the
cliff
sweeping
martin
back
among
the
rocks
when
the
great
wave
retired
and
martin
with
water
and
struggled
on
to
his
feet
he
saw
that
it
was
night
and
a
cloudy
black
sky
was
above
and
the
black
sea
beneath
him
he
had
not
seen
the
light
fade
and
had
perhaps
fallen
asleep
and
seen
and
talked
with
that
old
sea
monster
in
a
dream
but
now
he
could
not
escape
from
his
position
down
in
the
gap
just
above
the
roaring
waves
there
he
had
to
stay
sheltered
in
a
cavity
in
the
rock
and
lying
there
half
sleeping
and
half
waking
he
had
that
great
voice
of
the
sea
in
his
ears
all
night
chapter
xviii
martin
plays
with
the
waves
after
a
night
spent
in
the
roar
of
the
sea
a
drenched
and
bruised
prisoner
among
the
rocks
it
was
nice
to
see
the
dawn
again
no
sooner
was
it
light
than
martin
set
about
trying
to
make
his
escape
he
had
been
washed
by
that
big
wave
into
a
deep
cleft
among
the
rocks
and
masses
of
hard
clay
and
shut
in
there
he
could
not
see
the
water
nor
anything
excepting
a
patch
of
sky
above
him
now
he
began
climbing
over
the
stones
and
crawling
and
forcing
himself
through
crevices
and
other
small
openings
making
a
little
progress
for
he
was
sore
from
his
bruises
and
very
weak
from
his
long
fast
and
at
intervals
tired
and
beaten
he
would
drop
down
crying
with
pain
and
misery
but
martin
was
by
nature
a
very
resolute
little
boy
and
after
two
or
three
minutes
rest
his
tears
would
cease
and
he
would
be
up
struggling
on
determinedly
as
before
he
was
like
some
little
wild
animal
when
it
finds
itself
captive
in
a
cage
or
box
or
room
who
tries
without
ceasing
to
find
a
way
out
there
may
be
no
way
but
it
will
not
give
up
trying
to
find
one
and
at
last
after
so
much
trying
martin
efforts
were
rewarded
he
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
steep
passage
by
which
he
had
come
down
to
the
sea
on
the
previous
day
and
in
the
end
got
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
once
more
it
was
a
great
relief
and
after
resting
a
little
while
he
began
to
feel
glad
and
happy
at
the
sight
before
him
there
was
the
glorious
sea
again
not
as
he
had
seen
it
before
its
wide
surface
roughened
by
the
wind
and
flecked
with
foam
for
now
the
water
was
smooth
but
not
still
it
rose
and
fell
in
vast
rollers
or
long
waves
that
were
like
ridges
wave
following
wave
in
a
very
grand
and
ordered
manner
and
as
he
gazed
the
clouds
broke
and
floated
away
and
the
sky
grew
clear
and
bright
and
then
all
at
once
the
great
red
sun
came
up
out
of
the
waters
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
stay
there
longer
when
there
was
nothing
to
eat
his
extreme
hunger
compelled
him
to
get
up
and
leave
the
cliff
and
the
sandy
hills
behind
it
and
then
for
an
hour
or
two
he
walked
feebly
about
searching
for
sweet
roots
but
finding
none
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
then
if
he
had
not
seen
some
low
bushes
at
a
distance
on
the
dry
yellow
plain
and
gone
to
them
they
looked
like
and
when
he
got
to
them
he
found
that
they
were
thickly
covered
with
small
berries
on
some
bushes
they
were
on
others
crimson
but
all
were
ripe
and
many
small
birds
were
there
feasting
on
them
the
berries
were
pleasant
to
the
taste
and
he
feasted
with
the
little
birds
on
them
until
his
hunger
was
satisfied
and
then
with
his
mouth
and
fingers
stained
purple
with
the
juice
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
shade
of
one
of
the
bushes
there
too
he
spent
the
whole
of
that
day
and
the
night
hearing
the
low
murmur
of
the
sea
when
waking
and
when
morning
came
he
was
strong
and
happy
once
more
and
after
filling
himself
with
the
fruit
set
off
to
the
sea
again
arrived
at
the
cliff
he
began
walking
along
the
edge
and
in
about
an
hour
time
came
to
the
end
of
it
for
there
it
sloped
down
to
the
water
and
before
him
far
as
he
could
see
there
was
a
wide
shingled
beach
with
low
behind
it
with
a
shout
of
joy
he
ran
down
to
the
margin
and
the
rest
of
that
day
he
spent
dabbling
in
the
water
gathering
beautiful
shells
and
seaweed
and
pebbles
into
heaps
then
going
on
and
on
again
still
picking
up
more
beautiful
riffraff
on
the
margin
only
to
leave
it
all
behind
him
at
last
never
had
he
spent
a
happier
day
and
when
it
came
to
an
end
he
found
a
sheltered
spot
not
far
from
the
sea
so
that
when
he
woke
in
the
night
he
would
still
hear
the
deep
low
murmur
of
the
waves
on
the
beach
many
happy
days
he
spent
in
the
same
way
with
no
living
thing
to
keep
him
company
except
the
little
white
and
grey
sanderlings
that
piped
so
shrill
and
clear
as
they
flitted
along
the
margin
before
him
and
the
great
that
uttered
hoarse
cries
as
they
soared
and
hovered
above
his
head
oh
happy
birds
exclaimed
martin
clapping
his
hands
and
shouting
in
answer
to
their
cries
every
day
martin
grew
more
familiar
with
the
sea
and
loved
it
more
and
it
was
his
companion
and
playmate
he
was
bolder
than
the
little
restless
sanderlings
that
ran
and
flitted
before
the
advancing
waves
and
so
never
got
their
pretty
white
and
grey
plumage
wet
often
he
would
turn
to
meet
the
coming
wave
and
let
it
break
round
and
rush
past
him
and
then
in
a
moment
he
would
be
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
great
sheet
of
dazzling
white
foam
until
with
a
long
hiss
as
it
fled
back
drawing
the
round
pebbles
with
it
it
would
be
gone
and
he
would
laugh
and
shout
with
glee
what
a
grand
old
the
sea
was
and
it
loved
him
like
the
big
spotted
cat
of
the
hills
and
only
pretended
to
be
angry
with
him
when
it
wanted
to
play
and
would
do
him
no
harm
and
still
he
was
not
satisfied
but
grew
bolder
and
bolder
putting
himself
in
its
power
and
trusting
to
its
mercy
he
could
play
better
with
his
clothes
off
and
one
day
chasing
a
great
receding
wave
as
far
as
it
would
go
he
stood
up
bravely
to
encounter
the
succeeding
wave
but
it
was
greater
than
the
last
and
lifting
him
in
its
great
green
arms
it
carried
him
high
up
till
it
broke
with
a
mighty
roar
on
the
beach
then
instead
of
leaving
him
stranded
there
it
rushed
back
still
bearing
him
in
its
arms
out
into
the
deep
further
and
further
from
the
shore
it
carried
him
until
he
became
terrified
and
throwing
out
his
little
arms
towards
the
land
he
cried
aloud
mother
mother
he
was
not
calling
to
his
own
mother
far
away
on
the
great
plain
he
had
forgotten
her
now
he
only
thought
of
the
beautiful
woman
of
the
hills
who
was
so
strong
and
loved
him
and
made
him
call
her
mother
and
to
her
he
cried
in
his
need
for
help
now
he
remembered
her
warm
protecting
bosom
and
how
she
had
cried
every
night
at
the
fear
of
losing
him
how
when
he
ran
from
her
she
followed
him
calling
to
him
to
return
ah
how
cold
was
the
bosom
how
bitter
its
lips
struggling
still
with
the
great
wave
struggling
in
vain
blinded
and
with
salt
water
he
was
driven
violently
against
a
great
black
object
tumbling
about
in
the
surf
and
with
all
the
strength
of
his
little
hands
he
clung
to
it
the
water
rolled
over
him
and
beat
against
him
but
he
would
not
lose
his
hold
and
at
last
there
came
a
bigger
wave
and
lifted
him
up
and
cast
him
right
on
to
the
object
he
was
clinging
to
it
was
as
if
some
enormous
monster
of
the
sea
had
caught
him
up
and
put
him
in
that
place
just
as
the
lady
of
the
hills
had
often
snatched
him
up
from
the
edge
of
some
perilous
precipice
to
set
him
down
in
a
safe
place
there
he
lay
exhausted
stretched
out
at
full
length
so
tossed
about
on
the
billows
that
he
had
a
sensation
of
being
in
a
swing
but
the
sea
grew
quiet
at
last
and
when
he
looked
up
it
was
dark
the
stars
glittering
in
the
dim
blue
vault
above
and
the
smooth
black
water
reflecting
them
all
round
him
so
that
he
seemed
to
be
floating
suspended
between
two
vast
starry
skies
one
immeasurably
far
above
the
other
below
him
all
night
with
only
the
twinkling
trembling
stars
for
company
he
lay
there
naked
wet
and
cold
thirsty
with
the
bitter
taste
of
in
his
mouth
never
daring
to
stir
listening
to
the
continual
lapping
sound
of
the
water
morning
dawned
at
last
the
sea
was
green
once
more
the
sky
blue
and
beautiful
with
the
young
fresh
light
he
was
lying
on
an
old
raft
of
black
spars
and
planks
lashed
together
with
chains
and
rotting
ropes
but
alas
there
was
no
shore
in
sight
for
all
night
long
he
had
been
drifting
drifting
further
and
further
away
from
land
a
strange
habitation
for
martin
the
child
of
the
plain
was
that
old
raft
it
had
been
made
by
shipwrecked
mariners
long
long
ago
and
had
floated
about
the
sea
until
it
had
become
of
the
sea
like
a
floating
island
brown
and
seaweeds
had
attached
themselves
to
it
strange
creatures
half
plant
and
half
animal
grew
on
it
and
little
and
numberless
slimy
creeping
things
of
the
sea
made
it
their
it
was
about
as
big
as
the
floor
of
a
large
room
all
rough
black
and
slippery
with
the
seaweed
floating
like
ragged
hair
many
yards
long
around
it
and
right
in
the
middle
of
the
raft
there
was
a
large
hole
where
the
wood
had
rotted
away
now
it
was
very
curious
that
when
martin
looked
over
the
side
of
the
raft
he
could
see
down
into
the
clear
green
water
a
few
fathoms
only
but
when
he
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
hole
and
looked
into
the
water
there
he
was
able
to
see
ten
times
further
down
looking
in
this
hole
he
saw
far
down
a
strange
creature
striped
like
a
zebra
with
long
spines
on
its
back
moving
about
to
and
fro
it
disappeared
and
then
very
much
further
down
something
moved
first
like
a
shadow
then
like
a
great
dark
form
and
as
it
came
up
higher
it
took
the
shape
of
a
man
but
dim
and
vast
like
a
cloud
or
shadow
that
floated
in
the
green
translucent
water
the
shoulders
and
head
appeared
then
it
changed
its
position
and
the
face
was
towards
him
with
the
vast
eyes
that
had
a
dim
greyish
light
in
them
gazing
up
into
his
martin
trembled
as
he
gazed
not
exactly
with
fear
but
with
excitement
because
he
recognized
in
this
huge
under
him
that
old
man
of
the
sea
who
had
appeared
and
talked
to
him
in
his
dream
when
he
fell
asleep
among
the
rocks
could
it
be
although
he
was
asleep
at
the
time
that
the
old
man
really
had
appeared
before
him
and
that
his
eyes
had
been
open
just
enough
to
see
him
the
face
disappeared
and
did
not
return
though
he
watched
for
it
a
long
time
then
sitting
on
the
black
rotten
wood
and
brown
seaweed
he
gazed
over
the
ocean
a
vast
green
sunlit
expanse
with
no
shore
and
no
living
thing
upon
it
but
after
a
while
he
began
to
think
that
there
was
some
living
thing
in
it
which
was
always
near
him
though
he
could
not
see
what
it
was
from
time
to
time
the
surface
of
the
sea
was
broken
just
as
if
some
huge
fish
had
risen
to
the
surface
and
then
sunk
again
without
showing
itself
it
was
something
very
big
judging
from
the
commotion
it
made
in
the
water
and
at
last
he
did
see
it
or
a
part
of
it
a
vast
brown
object
which
looked
like
a
gigantic
man
shoulder
but
it
might
have
been
the
back
of
a
whale
it
was
no
sooner
seen
than
gone
but
in
a
very
short
time
after
its
appearance
cries
as
of
birds
were
heard
at
a
great
distance
the
cries
came
from
various
directions
growing
louder
and
louder
and
before
long
martin
saw
many
birds
flying
towards
him
on
arrival
they
began
to
soar
and
circle
round
above
him
all
screaming
excitedly
they
were
white
birds
with
long
wings
and
long
sharp
beaks
and
were
very
much
like
gulls
except
that
they
had
an
easier
and
swifter
flight
martin
rejoiced
at
seeing
them
for
he
had
been
in
the
greatest
terror
at
the
strangeness
and
loneliness
of
the
sea
now
that
there
was
no
land
in
sight
sitting
on
the
black
raft
he
was
constantly
thinking
of
the
warning
words
his
mother
of
the
hills
had
spoken
that
the
sea
would
kiss
him
with
cold
salt
lips
and
take
him
down
into
the
depths
where
he
would
never
see
the
light
again
o
how
strange
the
sea
was
to
him
now
how
lonely
how
terrible
but
birds
that
with
their
wings
could
range
over
the
whole
world
were
of
the
land
and
now
seemed
to
bring
the
land
near
him
with
their
white
forms
and
wild
cries
how
could
they
help
him
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
ask
but
he
was
not
alone
now
that
they
had
come
to
him
and
his
terror
was
less
and
still
more
birds
kept
coming
and
as
the
morning
wore
on
the
crowd
of
birds
increased
until
they
were
in
hundreds
then
in
thousands
perpetually
wheeling
and
swooping
and
rising
and
hovering
over
him
in
a
great
white
cloud
and
they
were
of
many
kinds
mostly
white
some
grey
others
sooty
brown
or
mottled
and
some
wholly
black
then
in
the
midst
of
the
crowrd
of
birds
he
saw
one
of
great
size
wheeling
about
like
a
king
or
giant
among
the
others
with
wings
of
amazing
length
wild
eyes
of
a
glittering
yellow
and
a
yellow
beak
half
as
long
as
martin
arm
with
a
huge
hook
at
the
end
now
when
this
mighty
bird
swooped
close
down
over
his
head
fanning
him
with
its
immense
wings
martin
again
began
to
be
alarmed
at
its
formidable
appearance
and
as
more
and
more
birds
came
with
more
of
the
big
kind
and
the
wild
outcry
they
made
increased
his
fear
and
astonishment
grew
then
all
at
once
these
feelings
rose
to
extreme
terror
and
amazement
at
the
sight
of
a
new
creature
a
thousand
times
bigger
than
the
largest
one
in
the
circling
crowd
above
coming
swiftly
towards
him
he
saw
that
it
was
not
flying
but
swimming
or
gliding
over
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
its
body
was
black
and
above
the
body
were
many
immense
white
wings
of
various
shapes
which
stood
up
like
a
white
cloud
overcome
with
terror
he
fell
flat
on
the
raft
hiding
his
face
in
the
brown
seaweed
that
covered
it
then
in
a
few
minutes
the
sea
became
agitated
and
rocked
him
in
his
raft
and
a
wave
came
over
him
which
almost
swept
him
into
the
sea
at
the
same
time
the
outcry
of
the
birds
were
redoubled
until
he
was
nearly
deafened
by
their
screams
and
the
screams
seemed
to
shape
themselves
into
words
martin
martin
the
birds
seemed
to
be
screaming
look
up
martin
look
up
look
up
the
whole
air
above
and
about
him
seemed
to
be
full
of
the
cries
and
every
cry
said
to
him
martin
martin
lookup

illustration
although
dazed
with
the
awful
din
and
almost
fainting
with
terror
and
weakness
he
could
not
resist
the
command
pressing
his
hands
on
the
raft
he
at
last
struggled
up
to
his
knees
and
saw
that
the
feared
monster
had
passed
him
by
he
saw
that
it
was
a
ship
with
a
black
hull
its
white
sails
spread
and
that
the
motion
of
the
water
and
the
wave
that
swept
over
him
had
been
created
by
the
ship
as
it
came
close
to
the
raft
it
was
now
rapidly
gliding
from
him
but
still
very
near
and
he
saw
a
crowd
of
rough
men
with
faces
and
long
hair
and
shaggy
beards
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
staring
at
him
they
had
seen
with
astonishment
the
corpse
as
they
thought
of
a
little
naked
white
boy
lying
on
the
old
black
raft
with
a
multitude
of
gathered
to
feed
on
him
now
when
they
saw
him
get
up
on
his
knees
and
look
at
them
they
uttered
a
great
cry
and
began
rushing
excitedly
hither
and
thither
to
pull
at
ropes
and
lower
a
boat
martin
did
not
know
what
they
were
doing
he
only
knew
that
they
were
men
in
a
ship
but
he
was
now
too
weak
and
to
look
at
or
think
of
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
and
what
he
was
looking
at
now
was
the
birds
for
no
sooner
had
he
looked
up
and
seen
the
ship
than
their
wild
cries
ceased
and
they
rose
up
and
up
like
a
white
cloud
to
scatter
far
and
wide
over
sky
and
sea
for
some
moments
he
continued
watching
them
listening
to
their
changed
voices
which
now
had
a
very
soft
and
pleasant
sound
as
if
they
were
satisfied
and
happy
it
made
him
happy
to
hear
them
and
he
lifted
his
hands
up
and
smiled
then
relieved
of
his
terror
and
overcome
with
weariness
he
closed
his
eyes
and
dropped
once
more
full
length
upon
his
bed
of
wet
seaweed
at
that
the
men
stared
into
each
other
face
a
very
strange
startled
look
coming
into
their
eyes
and
no
wonder
for
long
long
months
running
to
years
they
had
been
cruising
in
those
lonely
desolate
seas
thousands
of
miles
from
home
seeing
no
land
nor
any
green
thing
nor
dear
face
of
woman
or
child
and
now
by
some
strange
chance
a
child
had
come
to
them
and
even
while
they
were
making
all
haste
to
rescue
it
putting
their
arms
out
to
take
it
from
the
sea
its
life
had
seemingly
been
snatched
from
them
but
he
was
only
sleeping

american
reprint
of
the
little
book
worries
me
a
critic
on
this
side
has
said
that
my
prefaces
to
reprints
of
my
earlier
works
are
of
the
nature
of
parting
kicks
and
i
have
no
desire
just
now
to
kick
this
poor
innocent
that
old
woman
mother
nature
in
one
of
her
worst
tantrums
has
been
inflicting
so
many
cuffs
and
blows
on
me
that
she
has
left
me
no
energy
or
disposition
to
kick
anything
even
myself
the
trouble
is
that
i
know
so
little
about
it
did
i
write
this
book
what
then
made
me
do
it
in
reading
a
volume
of
fors
clavigera
i
once
came
upon
a
passage
which
sounded
well
but
left
me
in
a
mist
and
it
relieved
me
to
find
a
footnote
to
it
in
which
the
author
says
this
passage
was
written
many
years
ago
and
what
i
was
thinking
about
at
the
time
has
quite
escaped
my
memory
at
all
events
though
i
let
it
stand
i
can
find
no
meaning
in
it
now
little
men
may
admire
but
must
not
try
to
imitate
these
gestures
of
the
giants
and
as
a
result
of
a
little
quiet
thinking
it
over
i
seem
able
to
recover
the
idea
i
had
in
my
mind
when
i
composed
this
child
story
and
found
a
title
for
it
in
blake
something
too
of
the
spirit
of
the
child
hero
in
the
lines
naught
loves
another
as
itself
and
father
how
can
i
love
you
or
any
of
my
brothers
more
i
love
you
like
the
little
birds
that
pick
up
crumbs
about
the
door
there
nature
is
after
picking
up
the
crumbs
to
fly
away
a
long
time
ago
i
formed
a
small
collection
of
books
of
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
looking
through
them
wishing
that
some
of
them
had
fallen
into
my
hands
when
i
was
a
child
i
recalled
the
books
i
had
read
at
that
time
especially
two
or
three
like
any
normal
child
i
delighted
in
such
stories
as
the
swiss
family
robinson
but
they
were
not
the
books
i
prized
most
they
omitted
the
very
quality
i
liked
best
the
little
thrills
that
nature
itself
gave
me
which
half
frightened
and
fascinated
at
the
same
time
the
wonder
and
mystery
of
it
all
once
in
a
while
i
got
a
book
with
something
of
this
rare
element
in
it
contained
perhaps
in
some
perfectly
absurd
narrative
of
animals
taking
human
shape
or
using
human
speech
with
such
like
transformations
and
vagaries
they
could
never
be
too
extravagant
fantastic
and
incredible
so
long
as
they
expressed
anything
of
the
feeling
i
myself
experienced
when
out
of
sight
and
sound
of
my
fellow
beings
whether
out
on
the
great
level
plain
with
a
glitter
of
illusory
water
all
round
me
or
among
the
shadowy
trees
with
their
bird
and
insect
sounds
or
by
the
waterside
and
bed
of
tall
dark
bullrushes
murmuring
in
the
wind
these
ancient
memories
put
it
in
my
mind
to
write
a
book
which
i
imagined
would
have
suited
my
peculiar
taste
of
that
early
period
the
impossible
story
to
be
founded
on
my
own
childish
impressions
and
adventures
with
a
few
dreams
and
fancies
thrown
in
and
two
or
three
native
legends
and
myths
such
as
the
one
of
the
lady
of
the
hills
the
incarnate
spirit
of
the
rocky
sierras
on
the
great
plains
about
which
i
heard
from
my
gaucho
comrades
when
on
the
spot
the
strange
woman
seldom
viewed
by
human
eyes
who
is
jealous
of
man
presence
and
is
able
to
create
sudden
violent
tempests
to
frighten
them
from
her
sacred
haunts
that
the
story
of
my
story
and
to
the
question
in
your
publisher
practical
mind
i
sorry
to
have
to
say
i
do
know
i
have
no
way
of
finding
out
since
children
are
not
accustomed
to
write
to
authors
to
tell
them
what
they
think
of
their
books
and
after
all
these
excuses
it
just
occurs
to
me
that
children
do
not
read
forewords
and
introductions
they
have
to
be
addressed
to
adults
who
do
not
read
children
books
so
that
in
any
case
it
would
be
thrown
away
still
if
a
foreword
you
must
have
and
from
me
i
think
you
will
have
to
get
it
out
of
this
letter
i
remain
yours
cordially
