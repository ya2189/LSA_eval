by
somebody
that
very
big
i
could
see
it
was
a
head
and
he
was
spying
in

by

he
jerked
me
toward
the
shore
i
could
get
into
the

without
the

the
joke
was
on
mark
tidd
all
four
of
us
mark
plunk
smalley
binney
jenks
and
tallow
martin
which
is
me
stood
and
looked
at
the
big
ramshackle
summer
hotel
and
then
looked
at
one
three
of
us
grinned
grinned
did
i
say
maybe
it
started
out
with
a
grin
but
it
ended
up
with
us
rolling
on
the
grass
and
yelling
for
the
hotel
was
closed
tight
and
anybody
with
half
an
eye
could
see
it
been
opened
for
years
the
three
of
us
who
laughed
include
mark
tidd
he
laugh
he
looked
as
if
he
was
attending
three
funerals
at
once
and
trying
to
do
his
duty
by
all
of
them
he
was
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
in
that
shape
the
whole
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
of
him
was
flabbergasted
his
little
eyes
looked
sort
of
dazed
his
jaw
dropped
till
his
fat
cheeks
stretched
out
almost
thin
and
he
have
a
word
to
say
was
the
joke
on
him
well
i
should
say
here
he
had
brought
us
all
the
way
from
michigan
to
vermont
to
spend
our
vacation
in
this
summer
hotel
in
the
the
hotel
been
running
since
ethan
allen
licked
the
british
now
i
know
why
the
driver
who
brought
us
over
had
chuckled
so
much
and
why
everybody
else
in
the
little
town
had
seemed
to
know
something
funny
that
they
want
to
tell
us
as
soon
as
we
told
them
where
we
were
going
i
blame
them
have
laughed
too
think
of
us
out
there
at
lake
ravona
ten
miles
from
pretty
nearly
a
million
miles
from
wicksville
where
we
lived
think
of
us
there
and
then
think
about
the
hotel
being
shut
up
and
ready
to
fall
us
hungry
and
likely
to
keep
on
being
hungry
with
no
chance
to
get
anything
to
eat
it
had
cost
each
of
us
close
to
twenty
dollars
railroad
fare
to
get
there
and
it
would
cost
that
much
to
get
home
nothing
to
show
for
it
why
the
jokers
at
the
grocery
would
never
have
done
laughing
at
us
life
would
be
close
to
unbearable
and
mark
reputation
for
smartness
would
be
hit
so
hard
it
would
pretty
nearly
be
a
total
wreck
we
three
finished
up
laughing
and
waited
to
see
what
mark
would
have
to
say
in
a
minute
his
face
pulled
back
into
shape
and
began
to
grin
too
that
was
one
fine
thing
about
was
ready
to
own
up
when
the
horse
was
on
him
and
to
laugh
just
as
loud
as
anybody
else
says
he
stuttering
worse
than
he
had
for
a
month
looks
that
book
quite
up
to
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
little
booklet
with
a
picture
on
the
cover
of
it
and
began
studying
it
says
he
and
then
he
sat
down
and
laughed
so
he
shook
all
over
like
a
plate
of
jelly
years
old
six
wonder
how
they
kept
it
clean
in
the
we
had
found
the
book
in
the
depot
one
day
when
we
were
down
visiting
with
old
sam
clarke
the
agent
and
it
had
got
us
all
excited
by
what
it
said
about
fishing
and
mountains
and
deer
in
the
woods
and
such
like
it
sounded
like
about
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
never
stopped
to
see
when
it
was
printed
six
years
the
hotel
look
like
it
had
been
run
for
even
tidd
noticed
and
she
is
one
of
the
most
noticing
women
you
ever
heard
of
she
noticed
and
she
had
liked
the
place
as
well
as
we
much
that
she
got
our
mothers
to
let
us
go
with
mark
tidd
was
paying
our
expenses
he
was
rich
now
because
he
had
invented
a
turbine
engine
and
because
we
had
helped
a
little
once
when
some
men
had
gotten
his
model
away
from
him
he
was
going
to
send
us
all
to
college
and
every
little
while
he
did
something
fine
for
paying
for
this
vacation
trip
says
i
next
climb
back
into
the
wagon
and
make
for
home
says
plunk
smalley
mark
wrinkled
up
his
nose
and
looked
out
at
the
lake
exactly
fancy
home
like
this
he
says
else
to
do
says
binney
jenks
mark
turned
to
the
man
who
drove
us
out
of
a
humorous
feller
you
he
says
and
the
man
grinned
not
mean
but
like
he
was
enjoying
himself
and
mind
being
right
friendly
to
know
a
joke
when
i
see
one
says
he
is
one
all
says
mark
maybe
we
can
pull
some
of
the
laugh
out
of
it
if
we
can
get
a
good
holt
onto
it
who
owns
this
named
kind
of
a
man
is
he
after
you
for
flesh
and
lets
folks
call
him
jim
says
the
driver
in
town
we
better
call
on
ames
then
says
mark
into
the
wagon
the
idea
i
asked
him
that
far
yet
says
mark
that
was
the
way
with
him
you
get
anything
out
of
him
till
he
was
ready
to
tell
you
you
could
ask
questions
all
day
without
finding
out
a
thing
so
we
got
into
the
wagon
and
drove
back
the
ten
miles
to
town
the
driver
stopped
in
front
of
a
big
white
house
place
says
he
a
fat
man
was
working
in
the
garden
he
was
not
only
fat
but
tall
and
wide
across
the
shoulders
the
fat
was
mostly
in
front
and
from
his
chin
to
his
legs
he
looked
just
like
a
egg
there
was
a
cane
hanging
to
his
suspenders
i
noticed
he
turned
around
to
see
who
was
stopping
and
after
squinting
at
us
a
moment
through
colored
glasses
he
dropped
his
hoe
reached
for
his
cane
and
came
hobbling
toward
us
he
was
lame
one
of
his
left
stiff
at
the
knee
he
leaned
on
his
cane
and
sort
of
balanced
himself
by
holding
his
right
hand
on
his
hip
it
made
him
come
at
you
side
on
i
was
so
interested
in
his
gait
that
i
notice
his
face
till
he
was
close
by
then
i
guessed
i
knew
why
the
fellows
all
called
him
jim
he
was
the
sort
of
man
everybody
would
call
jim
even
if
his
name
happened
to
be
methuselah
his
face
was
the
way
mark
cheeks
are
red
but
red
like
a
he
had
three
chins
in
view
and
i
suspected
a
couple
more
hidden
by
his
shirt
there
was
a
little
scraggly
enough
of
it
to
pay
him
for
keeping
it
and
right
above
it
was
a
nose
a
nose
did
i
say
it
was
more
like
a
monument
it
was
the
kind
of
nose
folks
call
a
pug
but
this
was
a
pug
it
had
got
its
growth
if
county
fairs
were
to
give
prizes
for
the
biggest
pug
noses
ames
would
have
the
championship
he
had
on
a
little
linen
cap
that
looked
as
if
borrowed
it
from
some
boy
says
he
and
grinned
jim
says
our
driver
boarders
just
come
in
from
the
ravona
says
ames
and
stared
at
mark
stay
long
eh
board
suit
the
exactly
says
mark
seen
a
better
set
what
we
complain
of
is
the
crowds
we
came
to
a
quiet
want
to
get
in
a
jam
we
saw
folks
one
another
all
over
the
we
decided
we
out
of
that
wagon
says
ames
set
we
did
while
ames
grinned
at
us
like
we
were
good
to
eat
you
on
says
he
got
no
than
says
mark
ames
pounded
on
the
porch
with
his
cane
and
shouted
four
one
of
special
stay
to
supper
forget
the
that
sounded
pretty
good
to
all
of
us
i
can
tell
you
twenty
miles
of
driving
with
nothing
to
eat
is
enough
to
make
a
fellow
dance
a
jig
at
the
mention
of
a
baked
potato
ames
says
mark
never
set
anything
on
says
ames
wondering
what
mark
was
getting
at
i
expect
we
ever
been
arrested
for
to
me
says
ames
we
want
the
whole
town
of
wicksville
at
wonder
at
it
a
can
eat
says
ames
with
another
grin
say
we
can
take
care
of
take
their
word
for
ames
will
you
rent
us
your
well
sir
you
could
have
knocked
me
over
with
a
feather
you
could
have
done
it
with
a
feather
and
have
had
to
hit
very
hard
either
rent
his
hotel
i
thought
mark
had
been
hit
by
sunstroke
to
run
it
to
go
into
the
hotel
business
to
in
it
says
mark
the
four
of
occupy
the
whole
bedrooms
besides
the
office
and
kitchens
and
and
other
parts
of
the
want
the
whole
want
anybody
else
ames
scratched
his
head
and
felt
of
his
prize
nose
and
eyed
mark
and
the
rest
of
us
be
if
we
could
make
a
deal
says
he
much
says
mark
as
a
banker
to
fish
to
ketch
any
be
five
pounds
of
bass
live
weight
to
be
paid
every
thursday
come
after
he
pounded
on
the
porch
with
his
cane
again
and
bellowed
rented
the
hotel
got
the
for
four
beds
the
for
forty
says
ma
ames
from
the
back
of
the
house
somewheres
full
of
from
that
tarnation
how
about
dishes
and
ma
full
of
to
move
in
right
away
eh
sir
says
mark
you
and
your
stuff
out
included
in
the
rent
says
ames
mark
started
in
to
thank
him
and
so
did
the
rest
of
us
but
it
made
him
bashful
and
fidgety
and
you
could
see
he
like
it
just
in
the
middle
of
it
ma
ames
called
and
in
we
went
to
one
of
the
best
and
biggest
meals
of
victuals
i
ever
tried
to
get
the
best
of
chapter
ii
next
morning
ames
got
us
out
of
bed
before
a
rooster
had
time
to
crow
he
had
the
wagon
all
loaded
and
the
horses
hitched
when
we
got
and
all
there
was
for
us
to
do
was
to
pile
on
ten
miles
is
quite
a
drive
with
a
heavy
load
but
it
was
still
early
when
we
pulled
up
alongside
the
porch
of
the
big
hotel
it
made
me
sort
of
gasp
when
i
looked
at
it
it
was
so
big
and
we
were
going
to
live
in
it
all
alone
ames
said
there
were
bedrooms
and
i
expect
there
were
about
that
many
more
rooms
of
other
kinds
it
was
a
place
all
bulges
and
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
built
in
a
dozen
pieces
by
folks
whose
ideas
were
a
heap
different
there
were
three
stories
to
it
and
almost
every
bedroom
opened
out
on
to
a
gallery
or
a
porch
or
a
balcony
the
whole
of
it
stood
on
a
point
going
out
into
the
lake
just
off
the
end
of
the
point
was
a
tiny
island
with
a
little
bridge
across
to
it
and
on
that
was
another
big
building
where
ames
told
us
there
used
to
be
a
room
for
dancing
with
bedrooms
for
the
help
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
as
far
as
you
could
see
there
another
building
ames
said
there
a
cottage
on
the
lake
and
that
the
nearest
was
four
miles
away
the
woods
came
almost
down
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
all
around
it
the
hills
bulged
up
a
dozen
times
as
high
as
any
hill
i
ever
saw
in
michigan
says
ames
does
she
look
to
you
says
mark
and
we
all
agreed
with
him
in
the
yonder
says
ames
and
i
expect
i
put
the
in
the
wagon
so
if
you
want
a
boat
have
to
tinker
one
give
us
to
do
says
i
for
i
like
to
carpenter
or
meddle
with
machinery
or
mend
up
things
be
my
see
you
settled
says
ames
then
git
back
to
he
helped
us
carry
our
things
inside
some
of
the
stuff
we
piled
in
the
big
dusty
cobwebby
office
to
be
taken
care
of
later
the
bedding
we
took
after
we
had
selected
our
rooms
we
took
two
bedrooms
plunk
smalley
and
i
were
in
one
and
mark
was
in
the
other
with
binney
because
binney
was
smallest
and
would
leave
enough
room
in
bed
for
all
of
mark
the
rooms
were
right
over
the
office
and
were
connected
by
a
door
there
was
a
door
out
of
room
on
to
a
big
round
porch
right
on
top
of
the
main
porch
of
the
hotel
they
were
dandy
pleasant
rooms
we
put
in
most
of
the
day
cleaning
up
the
rooms
we
wanted
to
use
and
fixing
up
the
big
range
in
the
kitchen
we
expected
to
cook
most
of
our
meals
outdoors
but
there
would
be
some
days
when
we
and
that
range
would
come
in
handy
it
was
quite
a
job
but
when
we
were
through
our
bedrooms
and
the
office
and
the
and
the
halls
and
kitchen
were
as
clean
as
they
ever
had
been
by
eight
we
were
plenty
tired
and
ready
for
bed
then
we
made
a
discovery
that
was
going
to
be
important
before
we
got
out
of
that
important
we
have
a
candle
or
a
lamp
or
a
lantern
hustle
into
bed
before
it
gets
says
mark
and
we
scurried
in
about
two
jerks
we
were
undressed
and
between
the
sheets
for
a
minute
everybody
was
still
and
right
there
i
began
to
feel
spooky
i
got
to
thinking
of
the
long
halls
and
empty
the
ten
miles
between
us
and
town
it
comfortable
it
seemed
like
it
got
in
a
minute
and
then
the
wind
which
been
too
busy
to
notice
started
to
blow
around
the
hotel
and
make
noises
i
reached
over
and
felt
of
plunk
to
be
sure
he
was
there
and
i
caught
him
in
the
act
of
feeling
for
me
he
felt
the
same
way
i
did
still
it
says
i
mind
if
a
brass
band
was
to
start
up
under
the
window
says
he
in
the
other
room
we
heard
mark
and
binney
begin
to
talk
over
says
binney
of
the
bed
is
yours
fair
and
square
but
i
to
sleep
over
the
we
heard
mark
wallow
over
to
me
of
things
and
around
says
mark
the
door
locked
says
binney
any
key
says
mark
says
binney
we
was
to
move
a
chair
or
against
it
it
rattle
i
knew
binney
worrying
about
the
rattling
but
was
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
about
keeping
out
anything
that
might
be
prowling
around
and
i
nudged
plunk
we
sort
of
giggled
at
binney
but
i
guess
both
of
us
felt
the
same
way
he
did
on
to
sleep
says
mark
we
were
all
quiet
for
a
spell
and
then
mark
began
to
snore
he
the
nervous
kind
and
even
if
he
had
been
a
mite
timid
have
slept
just
the
same
i
never
saw
such
a
fellow
to
eat
and
sleep
well
we
laid
there
in
the
dark
listening
and
after
a
while
i
dozed
off
all
of
a
sudden
i
waked
up
with
plunk
clutching
the
side
of
my
face
says
he
i
hushed
all
right
and
listened
at
first
i
hear
anything
but
then
i
did
hear
a
sound
thump
thump
thump
it
went
then
it
stopped
and
started
over
thump
thump
thump
it
whispered
plunk
says
i
still
and
pretty
soon
i
was
sure
i
heard
something
come
sneaking
along
the
hall
i
held
my
breath
and
listened
with
all
my
might
whatever
it
was
it
came
along
breathing
so
you
could
hear
and
stopped
by
our
door
and
sniffed
then
it
sounded
just
as
if
somebody
said
to
see
says
i
here
to
be
bit
is
worse
up
and
i
jumped
out
of
bed
with
plunk
right
after
me
and
rushed
across
the
room
right
in
the
middle
of
it
i
ran
into
somebody
coming
from
the
other
way
and
down
we
went
in
a
kicking
punching
heap
scared
say
i
thought
just
naturally
scream
i
guess
maybe
i
did
let
out
some
kind
of
a
yell
whatever
run
into
was
pretty
lively
and
thrashed
around
considerable
all
of
a
sudden
i
realized
it
was
fat
tidd
says
i
that
you
says
he
you
around
at
night
like
this
for
to
you
this
is
our
room
it
was
that
you
outside
our
door
says
he
heard
it
and
up
to
on
then
says
i
we
untangled
and
made
for
the
door
i
grabbed
it
open
and
looked
out
the
hall
was
as
dark
as
a
pocket
the
only
light
was
a
window
at
the
far
end
that
seemed
about
half
a
mile
away
if
anything
had
been
between
us
and
that
window
we
could
have
seen
it
but
nothing
was
there
we
listened
there
a
sound
says
mark
it
was
says
i
both
imagine
at
once
would
we
the
wind
thump
says
i
we
stood
there
and
argued
about
it
of
a
sudden
mark
turned
toward
the
stairs
that
led
down
to
the
office
like
a
says
he
shut
the
outside
it
blew
i
fixed
see
then
says
i
and
all
four
of
us
in
our
nightgowns
and
bare
feet
went
traipsing
down
the
door
was
wide
open
mark
just
stood
looking
at
it
without
a
word
then
he
took
hold
of
his
ear
and
began
to
jerk
at
it
like
he
always
does
when
something
happens
that
puzzles
him
more
than
ordinary
he
went
close
to
the
door
and
looked
at
the
catch
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
dark
it
was
all
right
shut
the
and
the
bolt
says
he
nobody
could
have
got
in
from
outside
says
i
through
the
door
says
he
it
looks
like
somebody
went
out
of
i
heard
was
an
animal
says
i
animals
push
least
not
outside
of
a
pushed
that
bolt
mark
says
stubbornly
right
says
i
was
it
give
a
dollar
to
know
says
he
you
locked
it
plunk
asked
mark
looked
at
him
like
he
does
when
said
something
ridiculous
was
pushed
he
stuttered
says
i
lock
it
now
anyhow
and
i
slammed
the
door
shut
and
pushed
the
bolt
git
back
to
like
the
idee
of
somebody
around
this
place
while
asleep
says
binney
me
says
plunk
i
exactly
grin
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
it
myself
but
what
could
we
do
about
it
set
a
watch
says
binney
says
mark
but
binney
stuck
to
it
and
plunk
sided
with
him
so
did
i
we
drew
matches
to
see
who
would
watch
first
and
i
got
the
short
one
the
other
fellows
piled
into
bed
and
i
wrapped
myself
up
in
a
quilt
and
sat
in
a
chair
shivering
and
pretty
lonesome
i
can
tell
you
especially
after
the
others
went
to
sleep
it
have
been
so
bad
if
had
a
light
of
some
sort
but
there
any
even
moonlight
so
i
just
sat
and
wished
it
was
time
for
mark
to
get
up
and
take
my
place
i
almost
dozed
off
when
way
back
in
the
woods
i
heard
a
whistle
at
first
i
really
know
whether
i
heard
it
or
not
but
in
a
second
it
came
again
and
there
was
no
mistaking
it
somebody
was
out
there
among
the
trees
and
he
was
whistling
to
somebody
else
what
did
he
whistle
for
i
wondered
and
who
was
he
whistling
to
i
shoved
up
the
window
and
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
the
wind
almost
whipped
my
blanket
off
of
me
but
i
hung
on
to
it
and
looked
all
around
right
in
front
of
me
was
the
lake
as
black
as
a
great
big
at
the
right
was
a
bay
at
the
left
was
the
shore
and
the
road
with
the
woods
stretching
back
i
see
a
thing
alive
in
fact
i
see
very
much
of
anything
then
i
heard
the
whistle
again
a
little
plainer
than
before
i
strained
my
eyes
in
the
direction
it
came
from
and
waited
i
kept
on
waiting
and
then
almost
before
i
realized
it
some
kind
of
an
animal
rushed
out
of
the
woods
and
ran
up
on
the
porch
and
jumped
against
the
door
twice
it
jumped
then
it
ran
down
on
the
grass
and
tore
around
to
the
back
of
the
hotel
where
i
see
it
i
tell
what
kind
of
an
animal
it
was
because
i
could
scarcely
see
it
at
all
but
it
was
big
it
looked
almost
as
big
as
a
calf
i
got
back
into
the
room
and
shut
down
the
window
because
it
felt
safer
to
be
inside
when
animals
as
big
as
calves
were
rampaging
around
outside
just
as
i
got
in
there
was
a
slam
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
hotel
just
one
slam
and
then
everything
was
quiet
i
wrapped
up
tighter
in
my
blanket
and
sat
out
the
rest
of
my
watch
then
i
called
mark
and
told
him
what
seen
i
was
tired
and
sleepy
and
cold
so
in
spite
of
being
pretty
nervous
i
fell
asleep
in
a
couple
of
minutes
chapter
iii
nothing
happened
the
rest
of
the
night
whatever
it
was
that
had
been
prowling
around
the
hotel
prowl
any
more
by
daylight
it
all
seemed
like
a
joke
but
it
been
any
joke
in
the
dark
i
can
tell
you
the
cool
air
of
that
mountain
lake
made
us
hungry
enough
to
eat
the
blankets
off
the
bed
but
mark
said
that
be
fair
to
ames
he
said
no
hotel
proprietor
liked
to
have
his
boarders
eat
the
blankets
except
as
a
last
resort
we
built
a
fire
in
the
big
fireplace
in
the
and
it
two
minutes
before
we
had
coffee
brewing
and
bacon
frizzling
binney
who
was
considerable
of
a
cook
was
fixing
up
some
biscuits
so
you
see
we
really
need
the
blankets
after
all
we
do
says
i
the
boats
says
mark
to
have
the
in
shape
tell
when
out
and
we
have
an
enemy
on
our
coast
i
we
better
have
two
dreadnoughts
in
we
all
went
over
to
the
in
it
were
a
dozen
rowboats
a
couple
of
flat
bottoms
and
on
two
was
the
prettiest
cedar
canoe
you
ever
saw
destroyer
says
mark
that
to
the
fleet
and
carry
we
went
at
it
like
nailers
anybody
who
thinks
it
some
job
to
fix
up
a
boat
so
it
leak
just
wants
to
try
it
once
we
painted
and
calked
and
messed
around
all
day
and
then
had
only
two
boats
in
counting
the
canoe
we
went
at
that
first
and
gave
it
a
thick
coat
of
paint
need
it
any
says
mark
to
be
on
the
safe
at
noon
we
knocked
off
and
did
a
good
job
of
eating
we
ate
so
much
it
made
us
sleepy
so
we
strung
out
under
a
tree
to
take
a
little
nap
i
woke
up
all
of
a
sudden
with
the
queerest
feeling
it
was
just
as
if
somebody
had
been
bending
over
looking
at
me
close
and
i
had
felt
his
breath
in
my
face
i
jumped
up
and
looked
all
around
me
not
a
thing
was
in
sight
i
happened
to
look
down
at
the
grass
and
right
under
my
eyes
a
couple
of
blades
moved
first
one
and
then
the
other
seen
grass
straighten
up
after
stepped
on
it
well
just
how
this
grass
as
if
somebody
had
stepped
there
a
minute
before
says
i
he
sat
up
quickly
been
here
looking
us
do
you
know
says
he
i
told
him
about
the
feeling
i
had
and
about
the
way
the
grass
straightened
up
says
he
understand
it
be
so
interested
in
us
eh
who
in
the
world
could
be
around
this
old
hotel
natural
if
this
thing
keeps
on
to
look
into
better
look
into
it
anyhow
says
i
like
it
i
like
folks
parade
around
where
and
i
like
lean
over
and
blow
in
my
face
says
mark
but
you
could
see
he
was
put
out
and
worried
by
the
way
he
reached
for
his
ear
and
began
to
jerk
it
he
always
did
that
when
he
was
bothered
and
make
head
or
tail
to
things
the
other
fellows
waked
up
while
we
were
arguing
and
we
traipsed
off
to
work
again
just
in
front
of
the
hotel
where
the
grass
was
long
mark
stumbled
then
he
stopped
and
leaned
over
to
pick
up
something
leaning
over
is
one
of
the
hardest
things
mark
so
much
of
him
he
gets
in
his
own
way
in
front
he
grunted
like
everything
and
stood
up
with
what
looked
like
a
bone
in
his
hand
says
he
and
looks
at
me
with
a
queer
kind
of
expression
is
it
says
i
he
held
it
out
it
a
bone
at
all
though
it
looked
like
it
was
made
of
bone
it
was
pure
white
except
that
at
one
end
where
there
was
something
that
looked
like
a
handle
there
were
figures
and
funny
curlicues
carved
and
down
the
whole
length
of
it
was
a
row
of
things
that
looked
like
the
hebrew
letters
in
our
family
bible
do
you
it
is
says
i
taking
hold
of
it
mark
had
one
end
in
his
hand
and
i
had
hold
of
the
thing
that
looked
like
a
handle
it
was
a
handle
when
i
pulled
it
moved
toward
me
and
there
i
stood
with
the
most
knife
in
my
hand
that
you
ever
saw
it
had
a
straight
blade
more
than
ten
inches
long
and
on
the
blade
which
was
new
and
shiny
and
polished
were
more
letters
i
dropped
it
like
it
was
hot
a
dagger
says
i
and
i
guess
my
voice
sounded
scairt
like
that
says
mark
says
binney
looking
over
my
shoulder
an
indian
relic
maybe
been
here
for
a
hundred
says
mark
scornful
as
anything
how
it
got
so
rusty
and
battered
up
probably
laid
in
that
identical
spot
since
george
washington
discovered
the
never
discovered
the
mississippi
says
binney
did
just
as
much
as
that
knife
is
an
indian
relic
says
mark
at
it
it
polished
eh
been
taken
care
of
that
knife
laid
there
but
a
few
hours
heavy
dew
here
there
would
rusted
it
some
in
no
time
no
sir
whoever
dropped
that
did
it
last
night
or
like
one
of
them
you
could
buy
to
the
fair
says
plunk
a
says
mark
the
real
thing
seen
those
knives
and
swords
and
things
from
turkey
and
persia
and
such
but
cheap
jest
made
to
sell
to
folks
this
cheap
the
real
thing
i
tell
do
you
it
is
turk
or
what
some
such
race
owned
it
come
from
asia
or
africa
says
i
hope
the
feller
that
dropped
it
got
another
feel
safer
a
lot
if
i
knew
he
was
just
out
of
knives
like
this
and
get
any
too
says
plunk
wonder
how
a
man
in
these
parts
came
by
a
dagger
from
asia
says
binney
know
says
mark
it
a
man
from
these
maybe
a
man
from
likely
says
i
likely
a
man
from
here
would
have
such
a
weapon
says
mark
likely
be
around
this
hotel
and
likely
be
over
tallow
when
he
was
of
those
things
are
facts
they
well
bet
that
if
a
from
asia
here
a
man
from
asia
with
an
animal
from
asia
too
i
asked
because
there
was
some
kind
of
a
beast
with
whoever
was
skulking
around
last
night
be
to
a
camel
off
of
the
desert
of
sahara
says
mark
a
camel
i
says
was
too
matter
if
it
was
the
old
crocodile
of
the
nile
says
plunk
got
to
finish
up
those
so
we
took
along
the
dagger
and
crossed
the
little
bridge
to
the
mark
put
the
dagger
on
a
shelf
just
inside
the
door
and
we
all
rolled
up
our
sleeves
and
went
to
work
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
binney
said
after
a
while
much
from
the
rest
of
us
on
that
point
says
mark
says
binney
you
figger
out
a
scheme
to
discover
mark
grinned
he
liked
to
be
appreciated
notice
binney
ask
me
nor
plunk
to
think
up
a
scheme
no
sir
it
was
mark
he
asked
and
mark
was
pleased
he
the
least
bit
but
he
did
like
to
have
credit
for
what
he
did
and
for
the
kind
of
brains
he
had
he
deserved
it
too
i
suppose
there
are
a
dozen
boys
in
the
united
states
with
just
the
kind
of
planning
scheming
brain
that
mark
tidd
has
always
scheming
just
give
him
something
to
plot
over
and
happy
if
there
anything
for
him
to
plan
about
really
imagine
something
funniest
fellow
you
ever
saw
says
mark
was
a
whole
hotel
and
suppose
we
was
the
along
comes
an
army
of
knights
and
to
capture
all
of
a
sudden
he
got
interested
his
little
eyes
began
to
shine
and
his
fingers
sort
of
twitched
his
imagination
was
going
says
he
you
hear
a
trumpet
off
in
the
sure
we
do
says
plunk
says
mark
we
got
to
have
a
plan
of
got
food
and
water
to
think
of
both
says
i
the
castle
over
there
was
have
food
but
we
to
water
tell
you
fetch
a
store
of
food
over
here
across
the
bridge
then
if
it
got
too
hot
for
us
in
the
castle
we
could
retreat
and
tear
down
the
bridge
and
be
pretty
here
eh
says
binney
on
then
says
mark
divide
the
stores
and
half
over
here
in
case
of
of
course
it
was
all
just
pretending
but
it
seemed
mighty
real
with
mark
telling
it
and
before
we
knew
it
we
were
all
working
like
nailers
to
get
the
canned
stuff
across
into
the
house
where
the
boats
were
it
was
heavy
lifting
but
somehow
it
was
fun
and
as
exciting
as
if
hostile
were
actually
coming
down
out
of
the
mountains
to
attack
us
we
got
everything
all
arranged
and
sat
down
to
rest
can
attack
now
any
time
they
to
says
mark
ready
for
says
plunk
looks
like
we
did
a
lot
of
work
for
all
right
to
pretend
but
here
up
and
lugged
about
a
ton
of
grub
over
here
where
we
want
it
did
look
as
if
plunk
was
right
but
now
i
come
to
think
it
over
i
know
just
how
much
mark
was
pretending
and
how
much
he
was
carrying
out
a
plan
he
had
in
his
head
and
took
that
way
to
do
it
without
getting
the
rest
of
us
frightened
mark
always
took
the
easiest
and
best
and
safest
way
to
do
things
before
we
got
away
from
lake
ravona
we
were
mighty
glad
mark
pretended
we
were
going
to
be
attacked
that
day
i
can
tell
you
and
we
were
mighty
thankful
he
moved
all
that
store
of
food
across
to
the
building
on
the
island
if
he
done
that
i
know
how
we
would
have
come
out
but
anyhow
have
had
a
pretty
hard
time
of
it
and
a
close
shave
says
mark
get
back
to
mending
the
i
got
up
and
stretched
and
looked
over
toward
the
door
i
happened
to
remember
that
mark
had
left
the
dagger
on
a
shelf
right
alongside
the
door
and
without
thinking
i
looked
for
it
says
i
startled
you
take
the
dagger
says
he
where
you
put
it
says
i
everybody
looked
the
dagger
was
gone
yes
sir
it
was
gone
right
from
in
under
our
very
eyes
whoever
was
infesting
the
hotel
had
sneaked
right
up
to
us
and
got
his
weapon
in
broad
daylight
it
made
us
feel
pretty
not
very
comfortable
says
mark
i
capture
the
weapons
i
guess
know
enough
to
keep
them
you
see
he
took
the
blame
himself
that
was
his
way
too
he
wanted
praise
when
it
was
due
but
he
never
dodged
the
blame
when
blame
was
coming
but
taking
the
blame
mend
matters
the
dagger
was
gone
worse
than
that
we
knew
the
man
who
took
it
was
near
probably
he
was
watching
us
that
very
minute
we
drew
closer
together
and
looked
all
around
we
went
outside
and
looked
but
everything
was
silent
and
deserted
as
if
we
were
the
only
people
on
the
earth
ten
miles
to
town
says
binney
says
mark
after
ourselves
before
and
i
guess
we
can
it
this
but
for
all
that
there
were
four
boys
there
on
that
little
mountain
lake
who
had
their
hearts
right
in
their
mouths
ready
to
bite
them
chapter
iv
knows
stored
our
food
over
here
says
plunk
mark
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
was
all
i
had
to
about
says
he
start
a
he
walked
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
out
for
quite
a
while
finally
he
turned
around
and
asked
if
anybody
had
seen
a
strong
rope
lying
about
a
big
coil
of
rope
says
i
a
pulley
alongside
of
it
down
says
mark
it
took
two
of
us
to
carry
it
and
when
we
got
down
with
it
we
saw
mark
outside
staring
at
the
little
bridge
we
stared
too
it
was
about
two
feet
wide
and
maybe
twenty
feet
long
all
in
one
span
the
far
end
of
it
connected
with
a
board
sidewalk
just
as
it
did
on
our
end
a
saw
says
mark
binney
found
one
inside
and
mark
began
sawing
in
two
the
timbers
at
the
far
end
he
stopped
and
motioned
to
us
around
and
keep
says
he
as
if
you
were
for
something
i
want
to
chase
away
mr
mysterious
visitor
so
he
see
what
i
was
curious
to
know
what
he
was
up
to
myself
but
all
the
same
i
hurried
off
with
the
others
and
we
scurried
all
over
that
side
of
the
lake
we
ran
here
and
there
and
up
and
down
and
sideways
if
there
was
anybody
around
bet
we
kept
him
moving
so
busy
he
have
much
time
to
see
what
mark
tidd
was
up
to
in
about
an
hour
mark
whistled
our
whistle
which
meant
to
come
back
and
back
we
went
at
first
it
look
as
if
been
doing
anything
but
when
i
came
to
look
close
i
saw
he
had
cut
through
the
timbers
of
the
bridge
on
the
shore
end
and
had
driven
a
big
staple
in
on
each
side
on
the
island
end
of
the
bridge
he
had
cut
through
the
timbers
just
the
same
but
had
hitched
them
together
again
with
a
couple
of
whopping
old
hinges
i
see
any
sense
to
it
mark
grinned
and
pointed
up
there
to
one
of
the
timbers
supporting
a
balcony
was
attached
the
pulley
with
the
rope
running
through
says
he
says
i
says
he
citadel
has
in
case
of
attack
we
hitch
the
rope
to
the
staples
on
the
other
end
of
the
and
yank
up
comes
the
bridge
feet
of
water
and
deep
water
too
between
us
and
the
ever
be
able
to
lift
it
says
i
we
will
says
he
it
so
we
he
took
us
to
the
balcony
and
showed
us
how
he
had
made
a
weight
of
an
old
piece
of
iron
pipe
when
we
wanted
to
pull
up
the
bridge
all
we
had
to
do
was
hook
it
to
a
loop
in
the
rope
and
drop
it
off
the
balcony
mark
said
it
was
heavy
enough
to
lift
the
bridge
alone
but
that
if
we
were
in
a
hurry
we
could
pull
too
and
yank
her
up
in
jiffy
now
says
he
the
rest
of
us
were
willing
enough
and
while
i
built
a
fire
the
others
went
to
peeling
potatoes
and
one
thing
and
another
we
had
flapjacks
too
mark
had
learned
how
to
fry
them
in
a
pan
and
flip
them
over
in
the
air
just
like
a
regular
camp
cook
whee
but
they
were
good
we
ate
till
there
even
a
streak
of
batter
in
the
bottom
of
the
dish
do
we
sleep
binney
wanted
to
know
place
says
mark
to
set
watches
we
went
to
bed
in
the
dark
again
for
we
been
able
to
get
any
lights
mark
took
the
first
watch
not
a
thing
happened
he
told
me
when
he
woke
me
up
my
watch
was
just
the
even
a
suspicious
sound
and
it
was
the
same
with
plunk
and
binney
all
that
night
the
fellow
who
owned
the
turk
dagger
if
what
it
was
gave
us
a
rest
it
made
me
sort
of
hope
gone
away
got
to
begin
thinking
about
fish
says
mark
in
the
morning
of
us
better
fish
till
noon
while
the
other
two
watch
draw
straws
says
plunk
we
did
and
mark
and
i
were
the
ones
to
fish
we
took
one
of
the
rowboats
though
the
paint
quite
dry
it
leak
much
each
of
us
took
an
oar
and
we
trolled
with
two
lines
first
we
made
a
sweep
down
the
far
side
of
the
lake
and
inside
of
twenty
minutes
landed
a
bass
and
mark
was
fighting
with
a
pickerel
that
weighed
four
pounds
and
a
quarter
when
we
got
him
into
the
boat
for
ten
minutes
the
fish
let
us
alone
then
mark
hitched
on
to
a
regular
old
sockdolager
of
a
bass
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
about
as
busy
fishing
as
anybody
ever
did
we
got
him
into
the
boat
he
weighed
just
short
of
five
pounds
mark
dropped
a
lead
sinker
down
his
throat
to
give
him
a
little
more
heft
and
weighed
him
again
we
made
a
first
time
says
he
he
weighs
pounds
and
an
right
says
i
plunk
and
binney
a
mark
to
shoot
at
bass
biting
every
hook
that
dangles
in
the
we
got
about
enough
fish
eh
to
pay
ames
and
we
can
eat
says
he
take
a
look
we
rowed
about
a
mile
down
the
lake
toward
the
road
and
got
out
if
anybody
ever
passes
here
i
says
wait
and
the
road
look
like
it
was
traveled
over
as
much
as
main
street
in
wicksville
and
i
very
much
expect
to
see
anybody
unless
we
waited
all
day
but
mark
liked
the
idea
of
trying
so
we
hid
among
the
underbrush
and
pretended
we
were
a
from
the
castle
we
talked
in
whispers
and
were
pretty
cautious
i
can
tell
you
for
mark
said
that
part
of
the
country
was
swarming
with
foraging
parties
of
the
enemy
he
said
either
shut
us
up
in
a
dungeon
fifty
feet
deep
or
else
sell
us
into
slavery
in
a
far
country
if
we
got
caught
we
laid
there
half
an
hour
maybe
and
were
just
about
ready
to
give
it
up
when
mark
shoved
his
elbow
into
my
ribs
and
says
hush
in
my
ear
i
listened
sure
enough
i
could
hear
somebody
shuffling
along
the
road
we
held
our
breaths
and
waited
in
a
minute
a
man
came
in
sight
he
was
a
short
man
and
looked
sort
of
funny
even
at
a
distance
somehow
he
look
american
when
he
got
closer
we
saw
he
american
but
some
sort
of
a
foreigner
he
look
like
he
was
used
to
wearing
american
clothes
for
they
set
natural
on
him
about
ten
feet
behind
him
came
another
man
that
looked
enough
like
him
to
be
his
twin
brother
they
were
sort
of
dark
but
i
knew
right
off
they
indians
and
their
eyes
were
black
and
different
from
any
eyes
ever
seen
i
wondered
what
country
they
could
have
come
from
they
say
a
word
but
just
mogged
along
as
if
been
walking
a
long
ways
and
had
quite
a
ways
to
go
yet
when
they
were
out
of
sight
i
whispered
to
mark
think
says
he
indians
says
i
says
he
then
says
i
quite
make
out
did
you
notice
their
eyes
says
i
of
they
says
i
race
has
eyes
chinee
says
i
says
he
the
chinee
have
these
have
under
their
says
he
when
one
of
took
his
hat
off
i
says
he
those
men
were
from
asia
all
right
but
not
from
china
my
guess
is
they
were
well
sir
i
remembered
some
pictures
in
a
book
of
these
travel
those
men
did
look
just
like
japanese
i
guessed
mark
was
right
what
would
japanese
be
doing
way
up
here
in
the
mountains
says
i
he
shook
his
head
i
can
guess
just
like
i
can
guess
what
a
dagger
from
asia
or
africa
would
be
getting
lost
near
our
hotel
i
can
tell
you
that
startled
me
i
seen
any
connection
between
the
two
men
we
saw
and
the
dagger
but
right
off
i
began
to
think
there
might
be
some
that
dagger
was
turk
or
says
i
says
he
was
from
asia
all
right
but
it
might
as
well
be
from
japan
as
anywhere
else
so
i
can
that
was
so
you
suppose
those
japanese
men
were
the
ones
that
were
monkeying
around
the
hotel
says
mark
believe
there
was
but
one
man
in
the
hotel
those
two
like
they
came
from
a
long
ways
off
wonder
if
they
work
around
here
believe
it
somehow
japanese
fit
into
the
scenery
here
follow
after
those
a
i
was
willing
so
cautious
as
indians
we
trailed
after
the
two
japanese
it
was
better
than
pretending
we
were
scouts
there
was
excitement
about
it
for
we
know
what
those
men
might
do
if
they
discovered
we
were
spying
on
them
yes
sir
it
was
better
than
any
game
i
guess
doing
the
real
thing
is
always
better
than
playing
doing
it
just
the
same
as
eating
is
a
lot
more
fun
than
pretending
you
are
they
walked
pretty
fast
and
never
looked
around
but
for
all
that
we
take
any
chances
always
we
kept
close
to
the
side
of
the
road
so
we
could
duck
into
the
bushes
if
they
showed
signs
of
being
suspicious
and
as
much
as
we
could
we
kept
just
around
a
turn
of
the
road
from
them
that
was
pretty
easy
because
the
road
was
as
full
of
turns
as
a
pretzel
followed
them
maybe
twenty
minutes
when
i
saw
the
first
one
stop
and
hold
up
his
hand
the
other
one
stopped
too
then
so
quick
you
could
hardly
follow
them
they
dived
into
the
bushes
says
i
way
to
be
mark
say
anything
but
gave
me
a
shove
over
the
ditch
into
the
underbrush
heard
something
says
he
because
they
want
to
be
seen
now
i
know
they
work
around
here
and
pretty
sure
they
came
here
for
some
purpose
they
want
folks
to
know
here
the
matter
with
them
they
know
folks
in
this
part
of
the
country
would
get
curious
if
they
saw
a
couple
of
japanese
wish
says
i
i
could
get
that
dagger
out
of
my
head
it
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
about
when
out
here
in
the
woods
with
two
japanese
close
mark
grinned
a
little
figgered
on
a
quiet
summer
says
he
like
we
the
kind
of
folks
that
get
quiet
summers
says
i
had
one
in
five
minutes
a
rickety
old
came
along
it
was
what
scared
the
japanese
out
of
the
road
all
right
we
show
ourselves
it
went
banging
past
and
as
soon
as
it
was
safe
we
poked
out
our
heads
the
japanese
in
sight
we
waited
but
they
come
we
waited
some
more
and
some
more
after
that
but
not
another
sign
did
we
see
of
them
it
give
you
a
pleasant
feeling
i
can
tell
you
we
know
where
they
might
be
sneaking
in
the
woods
behind
us
back
to
the
boat
says
i
to
row
out
into
the
middle
of
the
lake
safe
there
nobody
can
crawl
up
on
you
when
you
mark
grinned
again
good
to
me
says
he
got
a
creepy
at
the
back
of
my
neck
chapter
v
we
got
home
with
our
fish
just
as
plunk
and
binney
were
getting
ready
to
eat
they
had
cooked
dinner
and
waited
for
us
until
they
stand
it
any
longer
mark
and
i
were
perfectly
ready
to
begin
too
after
lunch
we
made
a
to
keep
our
fish
in
it
a
but
it
was
enough
to
keep
the
fish
from
getting
away
we
made
it
by
piling
stones
in
the
water
close
to
the
kitchen
door
and
when
it
was
done
we
took
our
fish
off
the
string
and
dumped
them
in
one
was
dead
and
one
very
lively
but
the
others
seemed
as
good
as
new
we
skinned
the
dead
one
and
the
poorly
one
and
rubbed
salt
on
them
to
have
for
supper
binney
and
plunk
pretty
nearly
let
their
eyes
pop
out
when
they
saw
big
bass
pay
our
rent
for
a
week
to
ames
says
plunk
enjoy
it
as
as
i
did
it
says
mark
we
do
this
afternoon
plunk
wanted
to
know
mark
wrinkled
up
his
nose
and
squinted
to
me
says
he
we
know
as
much
about
this
hotel
as
we
ought
to
explore
it
from
cellar
to
garret
if
got
a
here
we
want
to
find
out
about
that
did
seem
like
common
sense
so
we
all
turned
around
and
went
into
the
office
from
there
we
climbed
the
main
stairs
to
the
second
floor
and
then
to
the
third
floor
well
sir
we
went
through
every
room
on
that
floor
and
every
room
on
the
second
floor
and
every
room
on
the
first
floor
and
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
basement
and
not
a
sign
did
we
see
of
anybody
more
than
that
we
see
anything
to
show
that
anybody
had
been
there
for
half
a
dozen
years
there
was
plenty
of
dirt
and
rubbish
and
cobwebs
but
that
was
all
it
made
you
feel
sort
of
spooky
especially
when
you
somebody
had
been
there
and
most
likely
had
been
there
some
place
for
goodness
knows
how
long
mark
tidd
looked
pretty
glum
somehow
not
finding
anything
seemed
to
upset
him
more
than
as
if
we
had
run
on
to
something
we
want
to
find
he
say
a
word
but
just
walked
off
to
a
corner
of
the
porch
and
sat
down
pretty
soon
he
began
to
whittle
and
we
knew
that
something
would
be
happening
shortly
whittling
is
about
the
last
resort
for
mark
tidd
when
everything
else
fails
he
sits
down
and
whittles
let
him
whittle
for
half
an
hour
and
you
can
bet
something
will
come
of
it
while
he
was
whittling
i
walked
over
to
take
a
look
at
the
big
fish
in
the
i
could
see
the
smaller
ones
but
the
whopper
in
sight
at
first
i
thought
he
was
hiding
in
the
shadow
or
had
wedged
in
among
the
stones
but
after
i
poked
around
with
a
stick
and
make
him
budge
i
began
to
get
frightened
frightened
is
the
right
word
and
you
would
know
it
was
if
you
had
a
black
bass
and
it
looked
as
if
he
had
escaped
i
got
down
flat
and
looked
as
hard
as
i
could
but
bass
was
gone
there
a
doubt
of
it
i
yelled
something
in
my
voice
told
them
that
everything
going
as
it
ought
to
and
they
came
running
even
mark
tidd
the
he
puffed
bass
got
away
says
i
mark
scowled
and
shook
his
head
get
away
says
he
could
get
out
of
that
fish
did
get
out
of
it
says
i
sort
of
provoked
at
him
if
a
fish
did
get
out
that
proves
a
fish
could
get
out
it
he
grunted
and
began
looking
careful
all
around
the
place
in
a
minute
he
stood
up
and
there
was
the
funniest
most
startled
expression
on
his
face
that
you
ever
saw
he
held
something
up
between
his
thumb
and
finger
it
was
a
silver
dollar
says
he
in
a
minute
got
out
tallow
he
got
out
and
this
dollar
to
pay
his
board
nice
fish
he
eh
because
a
leave
a
dollar
proves
a
fish
can
a
dollar
eh
good
argument
of
us
dropped
it
says
i
have
a
silver
dollar
says
binney
did
i
says
plunk
me
says
mark
well
that
left
it
up
to
me
i
did
have
a
silver
i
felt
in
my
pocket
for
it
it
was
there
heard
of
the
goose
that
the
golden
egg
but
i
never
heard
tell
of
a
bass
that
laid
a
dollar
says
mark
and
to
make
me
that
fish
left
a
dollar
says
plunk
who
always
see
a
joke
as
quick
as
he
ought
to
the
dollar
to
prove
it
says
mark
without
a
smile
he
it
on
purpose
it
was
wedged
in
and
held
there
by
a
stick
the
bass
must
got
out
on
land
and
it
up
that
way
so
we
miss
i
got
to
say
says
plunk
with
a
mighty
solemn
expression
that
if
fish
in
this
lake
can
leave
silver
dollars
behind
i
to
do
a
thing
but
fish
from
now
idee
says
mark
i
but
bass
can
do
the
trick
and
bass
very
thick
might
try
it
though
do
you
make
of
it
mark
says
i
mark
was
still
peering
around
examining
the
place
as
close
as
if
he
expected
to
find
some
more
dollars
he
got
down
on
and
looked
at
the
ground
and
then
he
sat
back
sort
of
and
was
taken
by
somebody
that
very
than
binney
i
should
say
but
heavier
he
probably
needed
to
eat
he
was
afraid
of
seen
so
he
for
it
so
he
took
it
and
honest
left
what
he
thought
the
was
worth
to
pay
for
says
i
color
were
his
eyes
says
mark
as
quick
as
a
wink
he
carried
a
club
with
a
knob
on
the
end
of
says
i
sarcastic
again
he
had
two
arms
and
two
legs
and
parted
his
hair
on
the
left
you
ever
see
him
says
mark
out
he
part
his
hair
at
says
i
mark
just
grinned
as
provoking
as
could
be
use
your
eyes
tallow
you
to
be
told
so
much
he
pointed
to
a
footprint
in
the
mud
it
smaller
here
binney
step
illustration
was
taken
by
somebody
that
very
binney
did
and
his
foot
was
half
an
inch
longer
than
the
mark
in
the
mud
here
where
he
knelt
down
his
toe
and
his
knee
see
how
far
apart
they
are
whoever
left
the
mark
was
some
shorter
binney
and
the
club
right
here
you
can
see
the
mark
of
it
with
his
hand
gripped
around
its
middle
knob
on
one
end
there
mark
grinned
at
me
and
i
guess
i
looked
sheepish
that
was
what
i
got
for
making
fun
of
him
i
might
have
known
he
guessing
you
know
his
eyes
were
black
and
that
he
part
his
hair
says
binney
that
but
to
a
cooky
says
plunk
binney
i
so
afraid
as
i
was
a
spell
says
mark
one
of
those
savage
african
dwarfs
and
got
his
how
about
that
eh
like
to
meet
one
of
those
dwarfs
plunk
plunk
looked
blank
for
a
minute
but
this
time
he
got
it
through
his
head
that
mark
was
joking
and
said
sort
of
weak
and
says
mark
that
a
fish
is
gone
prove
anything
but
that
a
fish
is
gone
remember
that
it
may
come
in
remember
says
i
every
time
you
see
a
summer
hotel
advertised
it
mean
that
the
hotel
is
still
it
was
the
best
i
could
think
of
just
then
and
if
i
do
say
it
i
think
it
was
pretty
fair
mark
thought
so
too
i
guess
for
he
says
got
me
there
tallow
so
call
it
we
walked
around
to
the
front
of
the
hotel
and
sat
down
on
the
porch
mark
was
tossing
the
dollar
up
and
catching
it
and
all
of
us
were
thinking
about
it
i
expect
guess
have
to
lock
everything
up
if
we
want
to
keep
it
says
plunk
be
better
to
up
the
fellow
doing
the
says
mark
so
easy
says
i
he
easy
to
i
guess
be
easy
to
says
binney
might
not
be
so
much
fun
his
club
and
that
big
sounds
sensible
says
i
try
to
get
a
look
at
him
before
we
do
anything
else
want
to
says
mark
tidd
his
forehead
getting
wrinkled
and
his
jaw
shoving
out
can
as
you
want
to
about
that
but
i
a
right
to
be
here
the
other
fellow
any
right
i
care
if
as
a
house
and
savage
as
a
he
stuttered
over
that
word
and
just
get
it
out
cross
bun
says
i
mark
paid
no
attention
but
went
on
stuttering
the
way
we
spell
hottentot
says
i
here
mark
says
to
stay
a
to
be
when
it
came
to
standing
up
for
his
rights
mark
tidd
was
the
stubbornest
boy
that
ever
was
he
just
set
like
concrete
and
the
only
way
to
move
him
was
to
blast
him
away
i
suppose
the
way
to
be
the
revolution
was
fought
by
men
who
were
stubborn
about
standing
up
for
their
rights
but
noticed
the
kind
of
fellow
who
wears
a
black
eye
oftenest
and
has
most
lawsuits
personally
for
a
little
before
i
get
into
a
rumpus
says
mark
as
anxious
to
get
a
peek
at
our
visitor
as
you
fair
says
i
him
peek
for
peek
peeked
at
us
often
at
us
now
says
binney
but
as
it
turned
out
he
just
then
chapter
vi
ames
be
out
plunk
asked
see
says
i
is
the
second
day
been
here
be
five
or
six
days
before
we
can
expect
to
see
says
mark
either
got
to
it
out
till
then
or
walk
to
plunk
sort
of
flushed
about
to
town
says
he
was
remember
to
fetch
a
lantern
or
to
give
us
a
little
him
a
wireless
says
binney
mark
began
but
he
never
finished
what
he
was
going
to
say
for
the
biggest
sort
of
a
barking
and
snarling
and
yelping
started
up
in
the
woods
not
farther
off
than
you
could
throw
a
stone
and
all
of
a
sudden
something
flashed
out
of
the
underbrush
and
came
scurrying
toward
the
hotel
we
all
jumped
to
our
feet
then
something
else
burst
out
of
the
trees
and
tore
after
the
first
thing
that
came
by
that
time
we
had
sort
of
collected
our
senses
and
could
tell
what
was
going
on
it
was
a
big
black
dog
chasing
some
littler
animal
that
seemed
to
bump
and
waddle
and
roll
along
but
made
a
pretty
fast
gait
at
that
the
dog
was
barking
as
hard
as
he
could
bark
about
fifty
feet
from
us
he
caught
up
with
the
little
animal
and
made
a
jump
for
it
well
sir
you
never
saw
anything
so
funny
in
your
life
the
dog
no
sooner
touched
the
little
animal
than
he
sat
right
back
on
his
haunches
like
he
was
too
astonished
to
live
and
let
out
the
dismalest
howl
you
ever
heard
he
yelled
the
little
animal
run
any
more
but
kind
of
curled
up
and
waited
we
went
running
over
to
see
the
fight
is
it
says
binney
says
mark
he
was
and
a
fat
old
whopper
too
with
enough
quills
on
him
to
satisfy
a
dozen
dogs
but
this
dog
satisfied
after
he
got
over
his
surprise
he
seemed
to
get
mad
and
in
he
tore
again
i
expect
he
figured
the
porcupine
had
hurt
him
by
mistake
but
he
found
out
different
porcupine
sort
of
humped
up
his
back
and
you
could
hear
his
quills
rustle
dog
shoved
his
nose
into
then
pulled
it
out
quick
he
was
one
disgusted
dog
and
telling
you
that
something
besides
his
feelings
were
hurt
he
looked
as
if
he
were
trying
to
grow
some
funny
sort
of
mustache
at
first
he
know
what
to
make
of
it
then
he
sat
back
and
began
to
paw
at
his
muzzle
he
pawed
and
pawed
and
when
he
found
out
pawing
do
any
good
he
took
to
rolling
and
while
he
rolled
he
yipped
and
yelled
all
of
a
sudden
he
remembered
his
dignity
and
stood
up
for
a
minute
he
looked
at
porcupine
and
all
his
mad
came
back
it
got
the
better
of
his
good
sense
he
seem
to
realize
that
the
time
had
come
to
arbitrate
so
he
took
another
lick
at
the
porcupine
who
was
just
beginning
to
move
off
as
if
it
figured
its
work
was
done
this
time
the
dog
stuck
to
it
as
long
as
he
could
but
that
very
long
and
when
he
backed
off
he
did
it
with
his
whole
heart
he
backed
off
so
hard
that
he
sat
right
up
on
his
tail
for
a
minute
and
then
rolled
over
backward
if
he
could
have
seen
himself
have
been
so
ashamed
he
have
shown
his
face
for
a
week
like
proud
dogs
do
when
something
makes
them
look
ridiculous
he
started
running
around
on
three
legs
and
pawing
at
his
nose
with
the
leg
that
was
left
then
he
stuck
his
muzzle
against
the
ground
and
began
to
spin
around
it
in
a
circle
like
he
was
trying
to
the
quills
out
but
anybody
could
see
he
was
having
hard
luck
at
it
porcupine
looked
over
his
shoulder
like
he
so
very
much
interested
and
for
all
the
world
he
looked
like
he
was
grinning
then
he
started
to
move
off
slow
this
time
the
dog
jumped
right
on
him
with
all
four
from
that
time
on
you
never
heard
such
squawling
in
all
your
born
days
we
were
sorry
for
him
anybody
would
have
been
but
he
was
so
funny
and
while
he
thrashed
around
so
there
a
thing
we
could
do
so
we
just
stood
there
and
laughed
but
in
a
minute
we
stopped
laughing
stopped
sudden
too
i
can
tell
you
for
there
standing
between
us
and
the
like
he
had
dropped
out
of
the
a
boy
we
had
been
so
busy
watching
the
dog
and
porcupine
we
seen
him
come
or
which
way
he
came
from
the
first
we
knew
there
he
stood
with
his
arms
folded
scowling
at
us
he
as
tall
as
binney
but
he
was
broader
he
looked
for
all
his
size
he
looked
sort
of
well
i
guess
is
the
only
word
to
describe
it
he
was
foreign
his
skin
was
dark
and
his
eyes
were
black
and
his
hair
was
black
and
it
parted
i
wondered
how
mark
tidd
had
figured
out
he
was
angry
but
for
all
of
that
and
for
all
his
color
and
his
foreign
look
he
was
handsome
he
stood
there
looking
at
us
for
a
moment
like
he
was
making
up
his
mind
what
to
do
with
us
then
he
said
in
just
as
good
english
as
any
of
us
could
speak
only
more
careful
and
sounding
somehow
as
if
he
had
to
remember
and
take
pains
to
find
the
words
have
hurt
my
dog
how
dare
you
hurt
my
dog
the
way
he
spoke
made
you
sort
of
jump
was
the
says
mark
pointing
to
where
the
little
animal
was
scurrying
away
dog
chased
it
and
got
quills
in
his
nose
we
touched
laughed
at
him
when
he
was
and
have
too
he
hurt
much
the
quills
will
come
out
easy
and
in
a
day
or
two
be
as
well
as
have
a
more
sense
know
better
than
to
tackle
another
the
boy
looked
at
us
right
in
the
eyes
without
speaking
for
a
couple
of
minutes
i
remember
ever
to
have
had
anybody
look
at
me
just
like
that
it
was
a
sort
of
look
are
you
doing
here
he
says
when
he
got
through
looking
us
over
mark
tidd
grinned
that
jolly
grin
of
his
the
grin
he
gets
on
when
he
wants
to
make
friends
or
be
particularly
agreeable
to
me
says
he
up
you
to
us
what
are
he
was
a
little
excited
and
stuttered
like
everything
the
boy
looked
puzzled
do
you
speak
like
that
he
says
have
not
before
heard
english
spoken
that
mark
looked
sort
of
taken
back
and
the
rest
of
us
laughed
right
out
the
boy
drew
himself
toward
us
and
clenched
his
fists
laugh
at
me
he
said
taking
a
step
toward
us
says
i
were
at
mark
tidd
the
joke
was
on
him
he
stutters
you
what
is
stutters
talks
like
you
heard
him
he
help
it
a
sort
a
disease
says
i
mark
got
red
and
turned
on
me
quick
a
disease
says
he
if
it
is
it
would
do
you
to
catch
mind
that
says
the
boy
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
as
if
it
matter
much
anyhow
are
you
doing
here
a
time
says
mark
that
any
of
your
what
are
here
we
rent
this
hotel
and
for
it
got
a
right
to
be
here
what
right
have
you
to
be
around
it
the
boy
stepped
forward
and
spoke
in
some
foreign
language
i
guess
he
was
mad
and
his
english
clean
got
away
from
him
he
stopped
of
a
sudden
and
says
so
we
could
understand
will
show
you
to
speak
with
more
then
he
shut
up
quick
and
acted
like
he
had
let
out
something
he
want
to
and
muttered
to
himself
in
his
foreign
language
again
just
as
respectful
to
you
as
you
are
us
says
mark
have
to
go
out
of
our
way
to
be
to
any
boy
you
might
as
well
understand
that
on
the
the
boy
looked
surprised
you
noble
says
he
says
mark
sort
of
puzzled
then
he
grinned
mean
do
we
to
the
nobility
if
it
i
as
noble
as
they
in
these
parts
i
call
to
mind
anybody
says
binney
of
us
is
entitled
to
be
president
of
the
united
we
can
get
says
the
boy
did
not
understand
i
ask
your
pardon
i
shall
not
again
commit
the
same
i
quite
catch
what
offense
he
was
talking
about
but
i
guess
mark
did
for
he
let
on
that
it
was
all
right
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
says
plunk
nationality
are
you
anyway
injun
the
boy
got
so
straight
his
back
was
like
to
bust
and
he
looked
as
proud
as
the
fellow
who
stuck
in
his
thumb
and
pulled
out
a
plum
am
samurai
he
said
recollect
ever
of
says
plunk
heard
of
sioux
and
pawnee
and
iroquois
and
such
but
cooper
nor
nobody
read
mentioned
japanese
says
mark
i
guessed
that
myself
and
had
been
wondering
if
he
was
the
son
of
one
of
the
men
mark
and
i
had
seen
on
the
road
that
morning
i
was
just
going
to
ask
him
when
i
thought
better
wait
and
let
mark
do
the
talking
a
ways
from
home
says
mark
says
he
long
way
a
very
long
says
mark
the
boy
frowned
then
he
looked
sort
of
undecided
and
uncomfortable
finally
he
made
up
his
mind
to
answer
says
he
you
come
way
from
japan
alone
plunk
wanted
to
know
are
two
ways
to
deal
with
a
question
one
does
not
want
to
answer
says
the
boy
is
to
lie
the
other
is
to
keep
silence
i
do
not
says
i
told
to
mind
your
own
a
cent
take
a
punch
at
him
plunk
whispered
leave
him
alone
he
might
you
says
i
name
says
mark
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
my
call
me
mark
mine
says
the
boy
he
stopped
a
second
may
call
me
motu
says
he
seems
of
funny
for
a
japanese
boy
to
be
up
here
in
the
mountains
all
alone
says
mark
and
then
added
daggers
and
taking
fish
and
prowling
around
at
night
like
he
was
afraid
of
can
tell
you
nothing
i
am
here
because
i
must
be
here
here
i
must
stay
something
happens
that
will
let
me
go
away
that
is
all
i
can
says
mark
tidd
motu
i
guess
it
more
comfortable
in
a
bed
nights
than
around
and
easier
and
more
to
eat
with
us
than
to
skirmish
up
food
for
yourself
of
room
and
lots
of
he
stopped
for
a
bit
and
then
went
on
more
polite
than
ever
heard
him
and
as
dignified
as
motu
was
will
give
us
pleasure
to
have
you
as
our
eyes
shone
and
he
smiled
accept
says
he
do
me
a
great
kindness
i
am
a
stranger
far
from
home
and
i
can
not
repay
except
with
this
country
says
mark
are
good
money
to
pay
for
hospitality
with
any
and
how
we
found
the
fellow
who
was
sneaking
around
the
hotel
and
scaring
the
daylights
out
of
us
how
he
came
to
live
there
with
us
and
how
we
started
a
friendship
with
him
that
got
to
be
one
of
the
things
that
proudest
of
of
anything
in
the
world
besides
that
the
reason
why
things
happened
to
us
that
very
pleasant
while
they
were
going
on
but
which
were
plenty
and
some
dangerous
how
mark
tidd
got
another
chance
to
show
what
a
head
got
and
what
backbone
there
is
in
glad
to
say
it
gave
the
rest
of
us
a
little
chance
too
and
we
took
advantage
of
it
in
a
way
that
we
ashamed
of
and
in
the
very
end
it
brought
us
something
that
pretty
nearly
surprised
us
to
that
i
believe
ever
was
had
by
four
boys
in
the
united
states
on
the
whole
it
was
a
good
thing
that
dog
chased
the
porcupine
and
caught
the
dog
think
so
for
a
day
or
two
chapter
vii
have
you
motu
mark
asked
while
we
were
trying
to
catch
the
dog
to
operate
on
him
for
porcupine
quill
says
motu
pointing
to
the
hotel
we
searched
it
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
find
a
motu
smiled
show
you
he
said
had
a
place
not
easy
to
he
talked
to
his
dog
and
after
a
while
got
close
enough
to
him
to
hang
on
while
we
pulled
out
the
quills
the
dog
yelped
some
but
we
explained
to
him
that
it
was
necessary
and
that
be
a
gone
dog
if
we
left
him
alone
somehow
that
seem
to
do
him
any
good
and
after
we
were
through
he
ran
off
and
hid
under
the
porch
the
dog
from
japan
plunk
asked
i
found
him
back
there
he
was
lost
he
wanted
to
stay
with
mark
nudged
me
and
whispered
sign
when
you
anybody
a
trust
like
that
pretty
safe
for
to
trust
him
it
sort
of
surprised
me
the
way
motu
talked
english
i
supposed
japanese
and
chinese
always
talked
sort
of
funny
like
find
dogee
back
topside
or
something
of
that
sort
but
motu
pronounced
his
words
right
and
was
that
particular
about
his
grammar
that
it
made
me
sort
of
ashamed
so
i
asked
him
about
it
you
learn
to
talk
english
so
good
i
says
have
gone
to
school
in
england
at
school
they
call
eton
also
i
am
coming
to
school
in
the
united
states
some
i
saw
mark
looking
at
motu
with
a
queer
expression
like
he
was
speculating
about
something
and
was
surprised
and
a
little
excited
by
what
he
figured
out
show
you
where
i
slept
if
you
like
says
motu
and
we
followed
him
into
the
hotel
and
up
to
the
second
floor
way
back
at
the
end
of
the
hall
he
took
us
into
a
bedroom
and
then
into
a
closet
off
the
bedroom
there
he
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
through
a
little
triangular
hole
where
the
rafters
showed
we
followed
him
it
brought
us
into
a
little
round
place
with
the
walls
all
sloping
up
to
a
point
like
a
hat
in
the
middle
it
was
big
enough
to
stand
straight
and
there
was
lots
of
room
to
sleep
and
keep
things
mark
looked
around
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
dim
light
for
there
a
but
a
few
little
holes
in
the
roof
know
where
we
are
says
he
satisfied
with
himself
in
the
peak
of
that
little
just
over
the
motu
nodded
you
ever
it
dog
chased
a
little
rat
or
a
it
i
followed
to
see
where
he
went
it
was
a
very
good
place
the
sort
of
place
i
needed
here
i
have
a
dandy
says
mark
kind
of
meaningly
says
motu
as
calm
and
cool
as
ice
but
that
is
all
he
did
say
there
a
word
of
explanation
about
it
or
why
he
wanted
to
hide
or
what
he
was
afraid
of
or
anything
it
began
to
look
pretty
mysterious
to
me
and
i
wanted
to
talk
it
over
with
mark
and
there
was
that
dagger
too
i
see
it
any
place
and
motu
have
it
with
him
somehow
i
wanted
to
have
located
about
that
dagger
i
asked
right
out
teeth
showed
in
a
smile
i
guess
he
was
remembering
how
easy
he
had
sneaked
up
and
got
it
back
from
us
have
put
the
little
sword
in
a
safe
my
careless
hands
can
not
again
lose
it
i
was
in
despair
i
searched
but
in
vain
then
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
i
saw
the
fat
boy
who
is
called
mark
tidd
pick
it
from
the
ground
i
was
i
was
glad
i
knew
where
the
little
sword
was
and
i
knew
i
should
have
it
might
not
says
plunk
we
left
it
laying
around
so
father
put
the
little
sword
in
my
hand
he
said
i
give
you
this
to
keep
fresh
the
honor
of
our
family
let
it
never
pass
from
your
so
i
would
have
taken
it
again
even
though
it
had
meant
much
it
sounded
like
something
out
of
a
book
but
i
guess
it
was
all
right
foreigners
do
odd
things
anyway
and
to
a
man
that
a
foreigner
they
act
sort
of
crazy
maybe
they
think
act
crazy
and
i
expect
if
we
were
to
go
to
japan
be
foreigners
we
it
looks
like
there
was
something
to
be
said
on
both
sides
of
the
argument
anyhow
my
father
never
talked
to
me
as
if
he
was
reciting
something
out
of
plays
mark
began
to
crawl
out
of
and
we
followed
after
got
of
bedding
to
fix
up
a
bed
for
you
motu
says
mark
on
and
pick
out
your
thanks
of
the
bedding
i
shall
borrow
some
blankets
but
the
is
best
i
think
that
i
should
sleep
where
i
have
here
says
mark
afraid
see
motu
held
up
his
hand
is
best
for
me
i
know
if
you
do
not
want
me
here
i
will
go
go
on
your
high
horse
now
glad
to
have
you
and
not
to
into
your
business
sleep
where
you
want
too
nice
a
day
to
waste
in
the
house
says
i
outdoors
and
find
to
explore
says
binney
says
mark
the
first
white
men
that
ever
got
here
to
this
lake
we
want
to
settle
here
but
we
till
we
know
the
of
the
best
way
is
to
divide
one
party
go
one
way
the
other
party
go
the
other
till
we
meet
that
says
i
meet
any
savages
injun
country
most
likely
they
here
to
fish
and
hunt
we
want
to
go
pretty
we
divide
up
says
plunk
and
binney
together
and
tallow
and
me
motu
can
go
with
whichever
he
wants
is
not
best
that
i
should
go
says
motu
i
shall
stay
until
you
come
right
says
mark
suits
so
we
started
off
i
looked
back
in
a
few
minutes
and
motu
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
ducked
says
i
to
mark
says
he
got
some
good
reason
for
out
of
sight
he
the
kind
to
be
afraid
of
if
because
to
hide
like
the
whole
business
says
i
a
japanese
boy
all
alone
he
come
from
and
he
here
next
that
afraid
of
what
is
it
then
we
take
him
to
live
with
us
if
like
to
hurt
him
it
just
as
like
to
hurt
us
what
i
want
to
of
myself
says
mark
just
run
away
from
his
folks
says
i
says
he
more
serious
than
that
maybe
these
japanese
have
feuds
like
the
chinamen
it
might
be
says
i
it
might
be
that
been
chickens
from
the
neighbors
without
permission
and
sort
of
looked
for
on
account
of
says
mark
disgusted
as
could
be
can
see
for
yourself
that
motu
the
sort
about
so
says
i
then
for
a
spell
we
talk
any
but
went
on
through
the
woods
being
careful
to
keep
under
cover
on
account
of
hostile
indians
we
sight
any
but
mark
saw
considerable
sign
left
on
their
visits
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
used
the
lake
quite
a
bit
for
one
thing
and
another
pretty
soon
he
began
to
sniff
he
stopped
and
pointed
his
stubby
nose
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
and
sniffed
like
to
play
a
solo
says
i
still
says
he
i
started
in
sniffing
as
hard
as
i
could
both
of
us
stood
there
and
sniffed
a
duet
must
have
sounded
sort
of
funny
says
i
sniffed
enough
for
says
mark
says
i
smoke
says
he
i
started
sniffing
again
harder
than
ever
lucky
got
a
good
nose
or
have
sniffed
it
clean
off
that
day
but
i
got
results
sure
as
shooting
i
could
get
just
the
faintest
whiff
of
a
fire
somewheres
be
right
ahead
says
i
where
the
mark
nodded
to
see
what
it
is
says
he
maybe
we
be
taken
by
come
on
as
quiet
as
you
we
got
on
to
our
stomachs
and
wriggled
along
like
a
couple
of
alligators
though
i
will
say
mark
looked
more
like
an
armadillo
alligators
run
more
to
length
than
to
thickness
but
mark
ran
to
as
you
might
say
we
just
inched
along
and
as
we
went
the
smell
of
smoke
got
stronger
there
was
a
little
hummock
just
ahead
with
lots
of
bushes
on
it
we
made
for
it
getting
our
faces
and
hands
nicely
scratched
up
and
went
up
it
like
a
couple
of
snails
climbing
a
snails
ever
climb
roofs
mark
was
ahead
when
he
got
to
the
top
he
flattened
down
as
much
as
he
could
and
it
looked
to
me
like
he
was
trying
to
shove
himself
right
into
the
ground
i
edged
up
alongside
and
looked
maybe
you
think
i
crowd
the
ground
a
little
myself
bet
i
made
a
dent
in
it
there
to
this
day
for
not
thirty
feet
away
was
a
little
fire
with
two
men
bending
over
it
cooking
something
or
other
their
backs
were
toward
us
and
so
we
see
their
faces
but
we
could
tell
they
were
short
and
broad
one
of
them
had
on
overalls
and
a
hickory
shirt
the
other
one
wore
shabby
black
pants
and
a
gray
flannel
shirt
i
wanted
to
say
something
but
i
dare
even
whisper
we
laid
there
as
still
as
a
cat
in
front
of
a
and
watched
after
a
while
one
of
the
men
turned
and
we
could
see
his
face
it
was
a
whole
lot
like
a
little
darker
and
not
so
intelligent
or
handsome
but
of
the
same
race
all
right
then
the
other
one
turned
and
he
was
a
japanese
too
they
ate
what
been
cooking
and
then
talked
a
little
in
their
funny
lingo
after
that
one
of
them
laid
down
and
shut
his
eyes
while
the
other
one
sat
up
with
his
eyes
wide
open
it
seemed
to
me
i
never
saw
anybody
who
kept
his
eyes
open
so
wide
and
i
says
to
myself
that
bet
his
ears
were
open
just
as
wide
as
his
eyes
he
was
keeping
guard
right
off
i
began
to
wonder
why
two
japanese
in
a
friendly
country
should
think
it
was
necessary
to
keep
watch
like
that
they
must
have
had
some
reason
for
it
mark
reached
over
and
touched
my
leg
and
then
motioned
back
toward
the
hotel
i
nodded
and
we
began
to
wiggle
away
feet
first
like
a
couple
of
crabs
we
went
pretty
slow
and
careful
i
can
tell
you
i
believe
i
drew
a
breath
till
we
had
gone
a
hundred
feet
and
my
heart
was
beating
so
loud
i
was
sure
a
man
could
hear
it
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
we
kept
on
going
slow
and
easy
till
we
were
around
a
little
bend
in
the
lake
and
then
we
legged
it
for
home
ones
we
saw
on
the
road
says
i
says
mark
ought
to
things
more
those
fellows
were
dressed
different
both
of
them
had
on
blue
suits
it
was
another
four
of
around
says
i
maybe
more
says
he
do
you
they
go
by
twos
instead
of
together
sometimes
i
got
to
with
if
you
was
the
country
for
somebody
or
would
you
go
in
a
crowd
or
would
you
divide
up
and
scour
the
locality
that
way
maybe
the
roads
and
that
sort
of
thing
divide
up
of
these
fellows
for
says
i
only
thing
i
know
of
a
thing
a
boy
and
name
is
says
he
bet
you
a
that
motu
is
why
these
fellows
are
in
the
woods
and
japanese
boy
at
chapter
viii
better
hunt
up
motu
and
tell
him
about
these
men
for
him
says
i
sort
of
from
actions
we
be
him
any
news
says
mark
may
know
says
i
hunted
for
but
maybe
he
know
the
hunters
are
so
are
tolerable
hot
says
mark
with
an
uncomfortable
grin
i
guess
so
long
as
motu
wants
to
mind
his
own
pretty
strict
better
do
the
same
he
knows
what
up
we
got
back
to
the
hotel
in
a
little
while
but
nobody
else
was
there
we
looked
for
motu
all
over
but
find
hide
or
hair
of
him
i
guess
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
sight
he
went
and
hid
up
but
it
long
before
binney
and
plunk
came
rampaging
in
panting
like
a
couple
of
grampuses
with
their
eyes
bulging
out
and
talk
just
spilling
out
of
them
in
bunches
they
both
wanted
to
talk
and
neither
of
them
could
manage
it
says
binney
and
stopped
to
pant
bumped
says
plunk
and
stopped
to
puff
we
was
binney
says
says
plunk
knows
got
us
sure
says
binney
down
says
mark
breathe
a
couple
of
breaths
and
drink
a
dipper
of
water
maybe
by
that
time
both
around
like
scared
be
a
scared
chicken
if
bumped
into
what
we
did
snapped
plunk
sir
says
binney
before
we
suspected
a
thing
we
almost
on
who
says
mark
of
them
japanese
says
plunk
says
i
getting
pretty
excited
myself
down
back
from
the
road
about
a
mile
up
says
binney
that
made
it
sure
it
was
two
japanese
our
two
have
gotten
where
plunk
and
binney
saw
theirs
four
of
says
i
i
said
binney
snapped
mark
grinned
but
there
much
in
that
grin
says
he
you
fellows
have
got
any
monopoly
on
japanese
we
saw
a
plunked
almost
yelled
there
says
i
jerking
my
thumb
over
my
finger
friends
binney
asked
they
be
says
i
appear
anxious
to
see
does
he
why
so
about
out
of
sight
plunk
asked
our
guess
says
mark
think
after
him
that
says
plunk
like
a
lot
of
trouble
to
be
for
one
boy
run
away
from
home
run
quite
a
ways
says
mark
as
sarcastic
as
could
be
he
must
the
pacific
ocean
on
the
way
this
any
scrape
serious
bet
says
binney
i
wisht
i
was
back
in
the
state
of
four
jap
men
for
one
jap
boy
and
as
close
to
him
as
these
men
are
to
motu
it
looks
a
heap
like
him
says
plunk
any
claim
to
him
says
binney
what
do
with
a
japanese
boy
if
i
had
him
them
men
can
have
him
for
all
of
guess
you
said
that
without
says
mark
figger
if
you
was
in
japan
and
four
americans
that
had
it
in
for
you
was
to
catch
you
you
have
any
friends
and
know
the
country
you
be
just
a
glad
if
somebody
was
to
give
you
some
help
eh
you
sort
of
at
it
as
though
it
was
to
help
you
tell
me
that
what
kind
of
a
country
would
you
think
japan
was
if
nobody
a
finger
to
help
you
pretty
rotten
one
i
guess
well
how
fixed
here
in
a
strange
country
chased
by
men
do
unpleasant
to
him
there
to
help
him
but
us
it
strikes
me
we
get
out
of
it
if
we
wanted
to
and
for
one
i
want
to
a
united
states
way
of
things
just
you
that
if
those
men
get
motu
be
i
help
it
to
stick
to
him
just
like
stick
to
one
of
you
then
he
go
back
home
and
say
the
united
states
is
no
good
and
that
american
boys
be
depended
on
now
what
about
it
if
you
like
out
go
ahead
but
to
stay
and
to
enlist
with
nobody
said
anything
for
a
minute
then
plunk
got
up
and
sort
of
stretched
and
felt
of
his
neck
and
blushed
and
says
goes
for
me
too
with
too
says
binney
looked
pretty
embarrassed
guess
i
think
much
before
i
spoke
says
he
have
it
clear
in
my
head
with
you
and
motu
can
depend
on
me
just
as
much
as
on
the
rest
of
for
you
says
mark
well
sir
something
happened
then
that
clean
took
the
wind
out
of
my
sails
it
was
pretty
embarrassing
but
come
to
look
at
it
now
when
over
it
was
sort
of
pleasing
and
satisfying
too
it
was
motu
he
stepped
right
into
the
middle
of
us
and
held
out
his
hand
to
mark
heard
says
he
his
eyes
shining
but
his
face
was
calm
and
dignified
and
without
any
more
expression
to
it
than
a
buckwheat
i
expect
the
japanese
way
not
to
let
your
face
give
away
what
thinking
about
you
said
to
the
others
i
heard
and
what
they
said
in
reply
to
you
it
was
as
samurai
boy
should
speak
first
for
the
honor
of
his
country
then
for
his
own
honor
you
mark
tidd
are
samurai
he
turned
to
the
rest
of
us
with
hands
stretched
out
you
too
are
samurai
this
story
shall
be
told
in
my
land
not
this
year
alone
but
for
years
to
come
it
shall
be
told
how
four
american
boys
came
to
the
aid
paused
checked
himself
then
went
to
the
aid
of
motu
it
shall
be
made
into
a
all
says
mark
flustered
as
could
be
mention
it
be
the
for
us
if
we
was
in
your
hope
i
should
says
motu
makes
me
proud
to
think
i
might
act
as
you
have
then
let
it
go
at
is
a
danger
says
motu
is
danger
but
you
offer
to
share
it
for
myself
i
would
not
accept
but
another
reason
i
do
accept
i
can
tell
you
nothing
i
can
not
tell
you
why
there
is
a
danger
but
i
can
tell
you
that
there
will
be
no
dishonor
to
you
in
giving
me
help
i
have
done
nothing
says
mark
need
to
say
that
we
knew
it
motu
shot
him
a
look
out
of
his
black
eyes
that
was
good
to
see
you
the
four
we
saw
are
all
there
are
after
you
or
can
we
expect
more
of
them
to
come
moseying
along
think
the
four
are
all
there
may
be
one
he
said
that
as
if
the
one
other
was
a
different
kind
of
person
from
the
four
and
you
can
take
it
from
me
as
solemn
fact
he
was
different
well
i
should
say
so
as
different
as
a
is
to
a
crowbar
or
a
weasel
to
a
hippopotamus
may
be
one
other
but
he
will
think
not
act
says
motu
we
should
of
those
thinkers
is
he
says
i
i
guess
we
can
match
him
huh
wait
till
mark
tidd
gets
to
checkers
with
your
thinker
and
says
motu
looking
at
mark
again
this
time
like
he
was
sort
of
weighing
him
and
measuring
him
one
who
will
come
has
a
cunning
brain
many
plots
he
has
he
goes
any
plots
around
here
think
he
bumped
into
the
side
of
a
a
house
at
that
why
mark
from
you
tallow
says
mark
sort
of
cross
but
i
could
tell
by
his
eyes
that
he
was
pleased
just
the
same
he
likes
compliments
but
the
ones
that
tickle
him
most
are
the
ones
about
his
head
mark
tidd
would
rather
think
up
a
great
scheme
than
win
the
dash
in
the
olympic
i
never
could
understand
it
i
guess
because
stronger
in
the
legs
than
inside
the
skull
man
who
will
come
says
binney
pronouncing
it
impressive
as
if
every
word
commenced
with
a
capital
letter
the
way
he
said
it
made
you
sort
of
worry
the
man
who
will
come
sounded
like
a
threat
it
was
a
sort
of
name
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
got
to
be
a
name
and
we
never
called
him
anything
else
even
when
we
knew
what
his
real
name
was
make
five
says
plunk
one
apiece
we
outnumbered
men
and
boys
says
binney
mark
was
looking
at
motu
and
thinking
hard
i
could
tell
that
because
he
was
pinching
his
ear
says
he
want
to
you
just
one
question
it
will
make
a
how
we
says
motu
those
men
you
i
mean
will
you
says
motu
will
seize
me
and
hold
me
i
must
not
be
seized
and
held
i
must
be
right
says
mark
i
heard
binney
muttering
to
himself
and
listened
he
was
saying
over
and
over
again
man
who
will
come
the
man
who
will
come
says
i
it
you
give
me
the
you
got
enough
shivers
says
he
got
a
stock
i
can
turn
over
to
you
without
says
mark
you
they
know
you
are
do
you
think
they
know
do
not
believe
they
have
found
me
yet
they
have
traced
me
to
this
lake
but
they
do
not
know
i
am
still
here
it
was
the
man
who
will
come
who
traced
me
they
will
find
it
gives
us
a
little
time
to
says
mark
we
can
keep
you
hid
for
a
couple
of
make
a
heap
of
a
couple
of
days
do
i
wish
get
at
it
and
have
it
over
with
says
plunk
to
be
a
siege
says
mark
we
got
to
see
that
our
and
the
moat
full
of
water
and
the
arms
and
armor
in
shape
come
with
and
catapaults
to
knock
breaches
in
our
walls
and
got
to
heat
to
pour
down
on
their
heads
you
ever
read
about
any
battles
and
sieges
of
castles
like
froissart
tells
about
in
his
chronicles
he
was
off
imagining
again
and
i
knew
there
any
use
trying
to
get
sense
out
of
him
while
he
was
that
way
might
as
well
try
to
play
checkers
with
a
bullfrog
a
foreign
prince
says
he
sought
our
his
enemies
is
for
him
got
to
tear
our
castle
down
about
our
ears
to
right
says
i
when
those
real
japanese
without
anything
imaginary
about
them
get
here
i
hope
have
to
stop
besides
castles
that
you
read
about
in
some
book
if
it
comes
to
a
rumpus
rather
have
a
pile
of
stones
to
throw
than
all
the
imagination
in
the
public
mark
sort
of
squinted
at
me
your
horses
tallow
before
out
of
the
woods
you
may
be
glad
read
books
and
gladder
that
got
an
so
says
i
pretty
dubious
but
before
we
out
of
the
woods
i
got
so
i
agreed
with
every
word
mark
said
without
his
reading
hitched
on
to
his
imagination
i
guess
those
japs
would
have
had
motu
and
would
have
eaten
him
in
a
sandwich
for
all
we
could
have
done
to
prevent
it
come
to
see
that
all
right
when
you
can
compress
it
and
shoot
it
into
a
cylinder
with
a
piston
in
it
like
you
do
steam
mark
tidd
was
a
cylinder
built
to
run
on
imagination
chapter
ix
first
thing
to
remember
just
says
mark
to
act
like
we
have
any
worry
they
know
here
so
got
to
act
natural
and
do
just
like
we
would
do
if
he
here
at
how
says
i
and
binney
go
as
soon
as
over
be
just
out
of
sight
you
and
project
around
here
to
see
what
we
can
scheme
so
we
got
supper
and
ate
it
inside
where
motu
be
seen
afterward
he
went
i
expect
to
his
and
mark
and
i
went
out
on
the
big
front
porch
we
sat
there
and
talked
for
a
while
all
at
once
a
big
rabbit
shot
out
of
the
bushes
with
its
ears
back
like
it
was
planning
on
making
considerable
speed
he
was
coming
blind
but
i
got
up
to
take
a
shy
at
him
and
he
saw
me
well
sir
he
was
one
flabbergasted
rabbit
he
stopped
and
then
jumped
sideways
and
then
jumped
the
other
way
for
a
minute
he
tried
to
run
four
ways
at
once
which
is
a
hard
thing
to
do
then
he
made
up
his
mind
and
scooted
off
along
the
shore
till
he
got
to
a
clump
of
little
trees
and
disappeared
says
mark
you
for
rabbit
says
he
made
him
come
out
like
that
scared
him
says
i
says
he
bet
i
know
what
it
was
watched
tallow
that
rabbit
marked
the
of
the
says
i
rabbits
says
he
sure
watched
you
can
see
to
it
the
watcher
see
to
be
of
profit
to
he
sat
pinching
his
cheek
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
he
says
get
up
and
then
stroll
into
the
hotel
slow
and
sneak
up
to
the
pass
any
windows
get
as
high
as
you
can
over
on
this
side
and
then
take
a
look
down
on
those
bushes
there
from
above
you
may
be
able
to
see
i
did
what
he
said
and
climbed
up
as
near
the
roof
of
the
hotel
as
i
could
get
then
i
crawled
over
to
a
window
that
was
facing
the
way
the
rabbit
came
from
and
looked
down
i
see
anything
but
trees
and
bushes
and
water
and
the
brown
of
the
road
winding
away
till
it
turned
a
bend
and
went
out
of
sight
but
noticed
one
look
always
show
you
all
there
is
to
see
lots
of
times
you
need
to
look
twice
and
sometimes
three
looks
do
any
harm
i
kept
on
squinting
see
something
move
when
you
look
down
like
that
on
a
mass
of
leaves
you
pick
out
objects
but
just
let
something
move
and
you
have
it
spotted
so
i
watched
for
a
motion
it
was
fifteen
minutes
before
i
saw
anything
and
then
i
saw
the
top
of
a
bush
crowd
over
and
spring
back
after
that
i
knew
where
to
keep
my
eyes
and
you
can
believe
i
kept
them
there
good
and
sharp
pretty
soon
i
saw
more
movement
and
in
a
minute
i
watched
something
dark
crawl
across
a
little
open
patch
it
was
a
man
all
right
seen
all
been
sent
to
see
so
i
went
on
down
to
mark
and
told
him
just
send
one
to
spy
around
says
he
hope
he
gets
an
eyeful
says
i
tell
plunk
or
binney
says
he
might
do
they
come
says
i
and
there
they
did
come
with
a
dozen
nice
perch
for
breakfast
i
pretended
to
stick
up
my
nose
and
says
see
any
bass
not
a
bass
huh
well
it
makes
a
heap
of
difference
who
goes
some
day
mark
and
take
you
along
and
show
you
how
done
plunk
was
mad
in
a
minute
a
better
fish
in
the
world
than
a
perch
says
he
rather
eat
one
perch
than
a
ton
of
says
i
would
you
rather
i
had
him
there
all
right
and
he
have
another
word
to
say
to
set
a
watch
says
binney
says
mark
watch
in
tallow
and
i
will
sit
up
till
midnight
and
you
can
come
on
till
right
says
plunk
ready
to
turn
in
now
come
on
we
all
went
into
the
hotel
and
binney
and
plunk
went
to
bed
mark
and
i
sneaked
up
to
the
top
story
where
there
was
a
sort
of
balcony
we
could
get
out
on
and
see
as
well
as
it
was
possible
to
see
in
the
dark
there
much
chance
for
anybody
to
see
us
up
there
we
sat
and
sat
and
it
got
cold
whee
but
it
got
cold
i
had
enough
of
it
to
watch
i
whispered
i
want
to
watch
warm
says
i
watch
inside
you
can
stay
here
and
freeze
if
you
want
a
good
idea
to
patrol
the
hotel
says
mark
so
we
set
out
stumbling
through
the
long
corridors
stopping
every
minute
or
so
to
peer
out
of
a
window
we
went
through
the
third
floor
and
the
second
floor
and
most
of
the
first
floor
then
we
sat
down
for
a
while
in
the
office
it
was
as
dark
as
pitch
and
scary
enough
to
suit
anybody
we
sat
there
long
till
mark
touched
my
arm
and
said
in
my
ear
so
low
i
could
hardly
hear
him
i
looked
there
was
a
round
blot
against
the
window
it
moved
and
i
could
see
it
was
a
head
and
he
was
spying
in
i
knew
he
see
us
in
the
dark
but
for
all
that
it
the
most
comfortable
feeling
in
the
world
pretty
soon
the
head
went
out
of
sight
but
it
showed
up
again
in
another
window
then
it
disappeared
and
we
could
hear
stealthy
footsteps
on
the
big
porch
the
next
thing
was
a
rattle
at
the
doorknob
then
slow
slow
slow
a
crack
at
a
time
the
door
began
to
open
i
was
shaking
all
over
and
my
heart
was
thumping
so
it
felt
like
it
would
shake
the
building
i
reached
out
and
felt
of
mark
to
make
sure
he
was
there
if
i
had
felt
for
him
and
found
he
there
i
believe
have
screeched
like
an
owl
and
tried
to
climb
the
walls
but
he
was
there
all
right
his
hand
that
i
touched
very
steady
either
i
guess
mark
tidd
was
as
scared
as
i
was
now
the
door
was
open
a
foot
and
the
line
of
light
disappeared
to
the
height
of
a
short
man
in
a
minute
the
light
such
as
it
was
was
there
again
and
we
knew
the
visitor
was
inside
inside
right
in
the
room
with
us
and
though
it
was
a
pretty
room
it
half
big
enough
to
suit
me
have
been
willing
to
have
it
a
mile
square
illustration
i
could
see
it
was
a
head
and
he
was
spying
in
as
i
said
it
was
as
dark
as
a
pocket
and
there
a
chance
of
the
man
seeing
us
unless
he
stumbled
over
us
mark
put
his
hand
on
my
knee
as
much
as
to
say
quiet
but
i
need
anybody
to
tell
me
to
keep
quiet
i
never
felt
more
like
being
still
in
my
life
i
quit
breathing
and
i
guess
it
was
five
minutes
before
i
started
up
again
i
believe
a
fellow
could
go
five
minutes
without
breathing
but
i
do
now
i
think
i
could
go
minutes
if
i
was
pushed
we
could
hear
the
man
along
the
wall
it
was
just
a
soft
rub
with
a
little
rustle
he
was
trying
to
find
the
door
i
expect
he
passed
along
the
wall
farthest
away
from
us
and
i
was
much
obliged
to
him
he
was
plenty
near
for
all
the
pleasure
i
could
get
out
of
his
company
he
found
the
door
all
right
because
i
heard
him
stumble
on
the
step
of
the
stairs
for
quite
a
while
everything
was
as
silent
as
an
shop
at
midnight
the
man
was
waiting
to
make
sure
nobody
had
heard
him
then
we
could
hear
him
start
to
creep
up
the
stairs
we
let
him
go
somehow
it
seem
worth
while
to
stop
him
maybe
if
had
a
gatling
gun
and
a
fiji
and
a
russian
bomb
and
a
suit
of
armor
and
a
i
might
have
asked
him
where
he
was
going
but
i
so
i
see
a
particle
of
use
in
interrupting
him
anyhow
he
might
not
have
liked
it
to
be
interrupted
and
he
was
a
sort
of
guest
it
polite
to
bother
your
guests
we
sat
still
about
an
hour
it
seemed
then
mark
whispered
him
notice
me
him
any
do
you
could
scare
him
out
says
he
best
to
him
prowl
he
hurt
anybody
or
and
he
find
motu
maybe
go
away
motu
here
at
hate
to
let
him
get
away
without
to
him
says
i
like
to
get
as
scared
as
i
was
and
pay
nobody
back
for
mark
chuckled
the
faintest
kind
of
a
chuckle
might
do
him
good
if
we
up
to
amuse
him
says
he
he
suspect
us
of
lem
me
ahead
says
i
can
be
done
at
all
hours
plunk
and
binney
leave
their
says
he
outside
the
over
and
get
says
he
i
very
anxious
to
but
i
anxious
to
let
mark
see
i
anxious
so
i
crawled
over
and
reached
through
the
door
the
cans
were
there
and
i
fetched
them
along
mark
dumped
the
worms
and
dirt
out
of
them
they
were
big
about
five
inches
high
and
both
of
them
had
their
tops
bent
back
where
they
had
been
opened
with
a
some
string
says
mark
i
gave
him
a
that
i
had
in
my
pocket
he
cut
it
and
fastened
the
cans
together
with
a
piece
about
four
feet
long
then
he
went
toward
the
stairs
as
still
as
a
fish
swimming
in
a
lake
he
had
taken
off
his
shoes
in
two
jerks
of
a
tail
he
was
back
did
you
do
says
i
still
and
wait
says
he
hide
behind
the
counter
then
says
i
we
did
for
half
an
hour
we
scrooched
down
behind
that
counter
waiting
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
little
jangle
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
right
on
top
of
it
there
was
a
big
jangle
followed
by
a
yell
and
somebody
came
down
head
over
heels
with
those
tin
cans
whanging
and
banging
after
him
i
knew
right
off
what
mark
had
done
he
had
put
one
can
on
each
side
of
the
stairs
at
the
top
with
the
string
stretching
across
between
them
as
soon
as
jap
came
along
his
feet
hit
the
string
and
jerked
the
cans
together
behind
him
with
a
bang
then
tripped
and
come
down
head
over
he
hit
the
bottom
with
a
whang
pretty
scared
by
that
time
i
calculate
in
a
jiffy
he
was
on
his
feet
and
streaking
it
for
the
door
just
as
he
got
opposite
us
mark
tidd
let
out
the
worst
screech
i
ever
heard
it
sounded
like
a
combination
of
a
wildcat
and
a
spooky
it
was
the
yell
i
ever
heard
the
jap
let
out
one
squawk
and
dived
at
the
door
head
first
then
he
ran
i
just
laid
back
and
laughed
not
out
loud
you
understand
but
silent
like
natty
bumppo
in
the
leatherstocking
tales
i
was
even
with
that
jap
for
the
scare
he
gave
me
all
and
a
little
over
bet
he
thought
the
hotel
was
haunted
by
the
worst
kind
of
a
ghost
and
bet
he
stop
running
till
somebody
stopped
him
we
can
go
to
bed
now
says
mark
believe
come
around
again
till
i
think
so
either
so
we
went
upstairs
chuckling
like
when
we
got
there
plunk
and
binney
were
sitting
up
shaking
in
bed
so
they
almost
threw
the
on
the
floor
was
that
binney
says
says
i
the
official
ghost
of
lake
ravona
he
a
peach
says
plunk
time
you
want
to
have
any
ghosts
around
just
let
a
feller
know
bet
you
scared
ten
pounds
off
of
me
and
i
so
fat
i
could
lose
it
like
some
folks
i
says
mark
who
was
pretty
sensitive
about
his
fat
and
like
to
have
folks
mentioning
you
fat
below
the
neck
but
from
there
up
there
so
to
say
for
it
our
turn
to
watch
says
binney
be
any
more
says
mark
see
to
chapter
x
the
next
day
passed
without
a
sight
of
a
single
japanese
motu
told
us
it
was
probably
because
the
four
were
pretty
badly
scared
by
what
happened
the
night
before
and
were
waiting
for
the
man
who
will
come
he
said
the
four
were
just
sort
of
scrub
japs
full
of
superstitions
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
says
he
expect
any
ghost
dodges
to
frighten
the
other
fellow
idea
was
that
the
four
would
lay
back
and
keep
watch
motu
stayed
inside
all
day
plunk
and
binney
fished
mark
pottered
around
on
the
island
across
his
little
and
i
know
just
what
he
was
up
to
though
i
found
out
later
and
so
did
the
japanese
as
for
me
i
was
just
plum
lazy
i
took
one
of
the
books
mark
brought
was
by
a
fellow
named
stevenson
and
was
all
about
a
man
named
alan
breck
and
another
called
davie
read
i
intend
to
read
long
but
i
found
out
got
hold
of
the
wrong
kind
of
a
book
to
quit
i
quit
and
put
in
the
whole
day
at
it
at
night
we
set
watch
again
but
nothing
happened
it
till
nearly
noon
next
day
when
something
did
happen
i
was
sitting
on
the
porch
at
the
time
with
mark
tidd
down
the
road
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
we
saw
a
man
coming
he
was
a
little
man
and
even
at
that
distance
we
saw
he
walked
sort
of
jaunty
swinging
his
shoulders
and
switching
off
leaves
with
a
slender
cane
he
looked
all
dressed
up
when
he
got
closer
we
saw
he
all
dressed
up
dressed
up
wow
i
should
say
he
was
he
was
a
regular
dude
sticking
in
one
eye
was
one
of
those
funny
spectacle
things
like
englishmen
wear
in
funny
pictures
there
was
just
one
glass
to
it
and
it
was
hitched
to
a
black
ribbon
on
his
head
was
a
straw
hat
one
of
those
kind
that
cost
a
lot
of
money
and
come
from
some
place
across
the
pacific
bankok
they
call
them
i
guess
his
clothes
were
light
gray
and
they
fitted
him
like
they
had
been
made
on
purpose
on
his
feet
he
wore
least
what
mark
tidd
said
they
were
never
saw
any
such
idiotic
things
before
seen
a
dicky
for
a
shirt
you
a
sort
of
false
front
well
spats
are
dickies
for
shoes
the
man
came
on
without
showing
a
sign
that
he
saw
us
his
face
was
screwed
kind
of
sideways
to
hold
that
single
glass
in
his
eye
and
he
appeared
to
be
pretty
well
pleased
with
himself
he
was
a
jap
says
i
says
he
one
who
will
come
has
we
waited
without
making
a
move
till
he
got
right
up
to
us
then
he
took
off
his
hat
and
made
a
bow
like
in
the
regular
old
you
good
morning
says
he
kind
of
mincing
his
words
like
a
girl
with
half
a
college
education
that
took
lessons
on
the
violin
and
elocution
morning
we
says
right
back
at
him
have
some
beautiful
places
to
live
at
says
he
as
polite
as
a
hungry
cat
miawing
around
the
might
disagree
with

mark

feel
pretty
well

of

to

pleasantly
through
hotel
in
search
ahead
search
till
you
wear
out
your
the
eyes
glittered
at
that
and
he
looked
as
eager
as
a
hungry
dog
gazing
at
a
bone
through
a
store
window
can
make
exhausting
search
now
sooner
the
better
says
mark
and
he
leaned
back
and
shut
his
eyes
like
he
was
sleepy
the
man
went
past
us
stepping
like
a
and
swinging
his
little
cane
there
was
perfume
on
him
because
i
smelled
it
as
he
went
past
he
look
back
as
he
went
through
the
door
we
turn
our
heads
to
look
after
him
for
quite
a
few
minutes
but
then
i
went
to
the
door
and
peeked
in
he
had
gone
might
find
motu
says
i
chance
says
mark
we
may
fool
him
into
motu

says
i

funny
talk
and
dude
clothes

a
sharp
little
customer
if
got
it
into
his
head
here
stick
around
till
one
way
or
the
so
says
mark
we
can
do
is
we
sat
there
feeling
pretty
anxious
and
it
seemed
like
most
of
the
morning
and
part
of
the
afternoon
had
passed
before
we
heard
anything
of
the
man
who
will
come
again
then
we
hear
from
him
exactly
it
was
from
dog
we
heard
the
dog
was
asleep
in
the
old
a
big
place
about
fifty
feet
square
it
was
bare
of
furniture
all
of
a
sudden
we
heard
the
dog
give
a
growl
that
grew
up
into
a
roar
then
there
was
a
sort
of
scurry
and
scramble
and
we
dashed
in
to
see
what
was
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
the
man
who
will
come
with
the
same
happy
grin
on
his
face
that
worn
when
he
met
us
outside
in
front
of
him
the
dog
was
crouching
for
another
spring
and
growling
as
savage
as
a
pack
of
wolves
just
as
we
got
there
the
dog
sprang
well
sir
i
thought
it
was
all
day
with
jap
for
the
dog
was
as
big
as
he
was
but
what
followed
was
as
pretty
a
sight
as
i
ever
hope
to
see
the
man
waited
till
the
dog
was
in
the
air
with
his
fangs
almost
at
his
throat
then
quicker
than
the
space
between
two
things
and
graceful
as
a
weasel
he
just
took
one
step
and
bent
his
body
to
the
side
the
dog
whirled
right
on
by
but
as
he
passed
the
man
whacked
him
a
good
one
right
across
the
muzzle
with
his
little
cane
big
dog
he
says
are
not
so
polite
brought
up
in
society
i
will
teach
you
to
learn
ho
the
dog
roared
and
jumped
again
and
once
more
the
man
dodged
just
enough
to
let
him
pass
and
slapped
him
over
the
nose
with
his
little
stick
he
laughed
while
he
did
it
and
acted
as
careless
as
if
he
was
just
playing
a
game
instead
of
trying
to
save
his
life
from
a
savage
dog
twice
more
the
dog
threw
himself
through
the
air
and
twice
more
the
japanese
moved
just
enough
to
let
him
slide
by
while
he
whacked
him
on
the
nose
graceful
well
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
and
cool
he
was
that
cool
you
could
almost
feel
a
chilly
breeze
blowing
off
him
that
dog
was
mad
he
seem
to
understand
just
how
it
happened
he
chewing
the
man
and
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
madder
he
got
but
he
saw
that
just
going
it
blind
and
leaping
for
the
throat
going
to
do
him
any
good
he
crouched
for
a
minute
and
then
began
to
creep
ahead
slow
slow
the
jap
stood
grinning
down
at
him
and
talking
all
the
time
big
dog
what
for
do
you
bite
to
eat
me
must
i
you
on
the
nose
ho
you
jump
so
slow
you
must
jump
with
more
fastness
if
you
catch
me
make
jumping
now
come
but
the
dog
jump
he
crawled
nearer
and
nearer
but
the
man
move
of
a
sudden
before
i
had
any
idea
what
he
was
going
to
do
the
dog
rushed
but
this
time
he
jump
he
came
close
to
the
floor
and
straight
for
the
legs
i
was
looking
right
at
that
man
but
he
moved
so
fast
i
follow
him
the
next
thing
i
knew
the
dog
was
rolling
over
and
yowling
for
the
jap
had
suddenly
shifted
somehow
and
kicked
the
dog
right
under
the
chin
with
a
kick
like
a
flash
of
lightning
he
had
a
chance
to
run
out
and
slam
the
door
then
but
he
stood
there
and
grinned
at
dog
well
sir
that
dog
went
crazy
he
yelled
and
made
another
spring
this
time
the
man
bent
backward
and
cut
the
dog
just
behind
the
ears
with
the
edge
of
his
hand
it
was
the
same
blow
some
folks
use
to
kill
rabbits
it
stopped
that
jump
right
in
the
middle
and
the
dog
slumped
down
to
the
floor
limp
and
kind
of
dazed
for
he
laid
there
a
few
seconds
growling
low
in
his
throat
and
acting
like
he
quite
sure
whether
he
was
a
dog
or
a
sack
of
potatoes
but
he
had
courage
that
dog
he
quit
he
struggled
up
to
his
feet
and
started
in
again
this
time
jap
stood
with
his
back
to
the
and
when
the
dog
jumped
he
went
down
on
one
knee
letting
the
dog
go
right
over
his
head
but
he
wait
for
him
to
go
way
over
he
rose
right
up
in
the
middle
of
that
dog
and
heaved
with
his
arms
and
his
back
and
the
dog
just
turned
a
in
the
air
and
went
through
glass
and
and
everything
out
he
went
bag
and
baggage
and
he
try
to
come
back
he
was
satisfied
the
jap
looked
out
of
the
window
to
see
the
dog
pick
himself
up
and
limp
away
then
he
turned
to
us
with
the
grin
still
on
his
face
and
says
dog
he
learn
how
to
know
better
i
feel
unreasonable
says
mark
added
to
education
have
gone
through
your
hotel
from
the
beginning
of
it
to
the
opposite
endings
but
there
is
not
anywhere
therein
a
japanese
boy
i
am
surprised
with
astonishment
he
came
by
toward
this
way
in
a
similar
direction
maybe
he
makes
a
hiding
in
the
woods
but
i
am
much
obliged
with
thankfulness
to
you
to
be
sure
now
good
day
and
pleasant
fishings
to
you
yours
very
with
that
he
turned
and
minced
out
of
the
hotel
he
excited
he
mussed
he
was
just
as
much
of
a
dude
and
just
as
spotless
and
spick
and
span
as
when
he
came
in
for
all
that
had
a
battle
with
a
dog
that
would
have
made
most
men
twice
his
size
get
out
of
breath
and
maybe
worse
i
looked
at
mark
and
mark
looked
at
me
quite
considerable
of
a
man
more
or
less
says
i
says
mark
expect
got
our
job
all
cut
out
for
little
man
gives
me
the
shivers
says
mark
and
just
how
i
felt
i
was
afraid
of
him
and
i
care
who
knows
it
good
and
afraid
chapter
xi
have
you
been
over
in
the
citadel
says
i
the
citadel
was
what
we
called
the
building
across
the
bridge
engines
of
says
mark
we
have
to
use
will
says
he
think
we
fooled
the
man
who
will
come
him
about
a
quart
or
maybe
a
pint
but
wear
off
he
the
kind
to
stay
says
motu
from
the
door
behind
us
will
not
stay
fooled
but
he
will
fool
others
so
they
stay
got
a
lot
of
respect
for
him
since
seen
him
in
action
says
i
he
discovers
me
i
shall
run
says
motu
will
be
decided
by
legs
who
has
the
best
legs
only
way
you
could
and
get
away
would
be
straight
up
says
mark
just
out
of
no
you
run
motu
stay
and
a
mark
tidd
this
large
hotel
can
not
be
defended
by
five
it
would
take
fifty
the
hotel
to
the
citadel
it
for
a
wait
till
these
fellows
discover
you
think
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
come
and
get
you
out
of
we
be
here
five
of
us
can
put
up
a
pretty
good
fight
in
the
for
a
walk
says
i
need
stay
and
to
motu
says
mark
i
went
off
alone
though
i
was
a
little
nervous
about
it
i
headed
toward
the
road
and
went
along
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
japanese
stepped
out
of
the
bushes
into
the
road
and
stood
in
front
of
me
he
just
stood
and
looked
at
me
and
scowled
i
walk
past
him
i
expect
i
could
have
if
wanted
to
but
i
want
to
i
stopped
and
looked
at
him
and
scowled
but
his
scowl
was
working
better
than
mine
at
any
rate
i
notice
his
knees
shaking
any
he
lifted
his
arm
and
pointed
back
toward
the
hotel
not
a
word
did
he
say
but
i
gathered
what
he
meant
all
right
he
was
explaining
to
me
politely
that
he
want
me
to
go
any
farther
i
was
obliging
about
it
and
turned
right
around
and
made
for
home
says
i
when
i
got
there
says
he
tried
to
go
for
a
walk
but
a
japanese
stopped
want
any
sent
says
he
we
fooled
a
lot
a
whole
lot
you
like
to
see
how
far
let
you
walk
the
other
way
says
i
one
bite
me
so
i
guess
the
next
one
and
at
that
i
started
out
and
went
in
the
opposite
direction
this
time
i
gone
a
hundred
yards
before
a
japanese
got
up
out
of
the
bushes
and
herded
me
back
the
same
as
the
first
one
did
we
were
besieged
all
right
i
told
mark
about
it
and
he
shook
his
head
like
known
it
all
the
time
prove
says
he
that
they
here
and
take
chances
they
we
get
a
chance
says
i
better
carry
the
rest
of
the
grub
across
the
says
he
see
us
and
suspect
have
to
over
what
we
can
but
enough
for
a
couple
of
weeks
there
about
says
i
not
there
but
we
can
take
in
a
second
always
have
them
piled
together
ready
to
grab
be
your
job
tallow
remember
at
the
first
alarm
drop
everything
and
forget
everything
else
just
those
dishes
and
right
says
i
goes
to
get
ready
and
now
came
the
discovery
of
motu
by
the
man
who
will
come
it
was
by
fault
unless
it
was
own
but
if
what
he
did
was
a
fault
then
i
should
like
to
be
committing
faults
like
it
all
my
life
we
had
all
gotten
to
like
motu
for
he
was
so
pleasant
and
gentlemanly
and
patient
but
that
was
all
we
feel
toward
him
like
we
felt
toward
one
another
and
it
to
be
expected
but
from
that
time
on
he
belonged
it
was
the
first
time
a
boy
had
ever
been
let
into
our
crowd
of
four
and
the
last
this
boy
deserved
it
the
thing
motu
did
was
not
only
brave
for
it
such
a
big
thing
to
be
brave
but
it
was
which
is
a
big
thing
he
not
only
did
a
brave
thing
in
an
emergency
when
quick
thinking
and
quick
acting
had
to
be
done
but
with
his
eyes
open
he
risked
capture
by
the
japanese
with
all
the
important
results
that
would
have
come
from
it
without
a
hesitation
he
risked
everything
for
one
of
us
and
i
hope
that
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
we
will
be
just
as
quick
to
risk
everything
for
him
this
was
the
way
of
it
plunk
and
binney
came
in
from
fishing
they
had
been
out
in
the
canoe
and
luck
had
been
right
in
the
boat
with
them
for
they
had
a
dandy
string
of
bass
and
pickerel
plunk
got
out
with
the
fish
and
carried
them
over
to
the
for
some
reason
or
another
binney
pushed
off
again
all
alone
and
paddled
out
about
twenty
feet
from
shore
i
guess
at
the
start
he
had
it
in
mind
to
go
somewhere
but
changed
his
plan
he
stopped
where
the
water
was
about
four
feet
deep
and
then
like
a
little
idiot
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
to
wash
his
face
he
washed
it
all
right
and
the
rest
of
him
with
it
just
as
if
it
had
been
alive
and
wanted
to
get
rid
of
binney
that
canoe
tipped
over
it
went
binney
just
had
time
to
let
out
a
yell
i
came
to
the
kitchen
door
where
i
had
been
putting
the
in
shape
and
saw
him
take
the
dive
other
folks
heard
the
yell
for
out
of
the
tail
of
my
eye
i
saw
the
man
who
will
come
step
into
sight
about
two
hundred
yards
down
the
road
and
stand
looking
i
expected
binney
to
come
right
up
and
wade
ashore
but
he
i
understand
it
and
my
mind
work
fast
enough
to
figure
what
had
happened
mark
was
across
the
bridge
in
the
citadel
so
he
there
to
help
any
and
if
it
been
for
motu
i
guess
our
crowd
of
four
would
have
been
cut
down
to
three
and
a
pretty
sorrowful
three
but
motu
was
there
and
the
day
will
never
come
when
i
stop
being
thankful
for
it
while
i
stood
there
like
a
big
booby
motu
came
rushing
out
of
the
hotel
and
plunged
into
the
water
he
swim
either
but
fortunately
the
water
over
his
head
between
him
and
binney
he
surged
and
jumped
and
plowed
his
way
to
where
the
canoe
floated
bottom
and
bobbed
and
wiggled
as
binney
struggled
under
it
where
he
had
got
caught
somehow
when
motu
got
there
he
just
ducked
under
it
pulled
a
yell
right
out
of
me
i
was
so
frightened
it
seemed
like
he
was
underwater
half
an
hour
but
it
have
been
more
than
a
few
seconds
when
he
came
up
he
was
dragging
something
with
him
and
that
something
was
binney
and
unconscious
then
motu
began
plowing
his
way
back
again
of
a
sudden
i
remembered
the
man
who
will
come
and
looked
that
way
he
was
coming
on
the
run
with
two
japanese
at
his
heels
they
had
covered
half
the
distance
motu
quick
i
bawled
and
dashed
into
the
kitchen
for
my
dishes
by
the
time
i
was
out
motu
was
almost
to
shore
and
the
japs
were
not
fifty
yards
away
i
yelled
tidd
and
scooted
across
the
bridge
i
might
have
known
mark
be
far
away
from
his
job
before
i
was
across
mark
leaned
over
the
balcony
above
and
threw
down
the
end
of
a
rope
with
a
hook
on
it
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
he
stuttered
as
excited
as
a
chicken
when
a
around
i
got
the
idea
grabbed
the
rope
and
hooked
it
to
the
staple
on
the
far
end
of
the
then
i
jumped
back
for
the
citadel
side
now
motu
was
coming
staggering
and
running
with
binney
over
his
shoulder
behind
him
not
yards
away
were
the
three
japs
lips
were
drawn
back
so
you
could
see
his
beautiful
white
teeth
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
the
sort
a
man
wears
when
he
is
making
the
greatest
effort
of
his
life
motu
hurry
i
yelled
and
danced
up
and
down
with
eagerness
and
fear
and
excitement
motu
far
to
go
but
binney
was
bigger
than
he
was
and
it
was
too
much
for
him
to
carry
my
but
he
was
strong
he
staggered
on
tripping
almost
falling
on
his
face
sometimes
and
the
japs
got
closer
and
closer
i
grabbed
up
a
couple
of
potatoes
that
had
somehow
spilled
when
we
carried
them
over
and
heaved
one
at
the
first
jap
i
hit
him
too
so
that
he
grunted
and
stopped
a
little
maybe
it
was
enough
to
help
then
i
threw
the
other
at
the
man
who
will
come
but
he
just
moved
his
head
and
i
could
see
him
grin
for
all
he
was
running
so
hard
now
motu
was
at
the
very
edge
of
the
bridge
with
the
japs
not
a
dozen
feet
behind
from
the
balcony
i
heard
mark
yell
binney
on
the
and
quick
as
a
wink
motu
did
as
he
was
told
and
then
mark
drawbridge
showed
what
it
was
made
for
the
instant
the
two
boys
were
on
the
bridge
mark
pushed
over
the
iron
weight
that
was
to
help
lift
it
but
this
was
no
time
for
slow
lifting
so
what
did
mark
do
but
grab
that
rope
just
above
the
weight
and
jump
right
off
the
balcony
down
he
came
and
up
went
the
bridge
with
motu
and
binney
on
it
up
it
went
with
the
first
japanese
so
close
it
almost
caught
him
under
the
nose
he
stop
and
went
right
under
the
lift
into
the
water
motu
and
binney
came
rolling
and
bumping
down
the
bridge
to
our
side
the
japs
stopped
sudden
and
one
of
them
hauled
out
the
man
who
had
fallen
in
panted
motu
so
for
a
while
at
least
we
were
safe
there
a
boat
on
that
side
they
come
anywhere
near
jumping
across
and
they
do
anything
till
they
had
figured
out
some
scheme
to
cross
the
water
by
this
time
mark
tidd
was
working
over
binney
he
knew
all
about
first
aid
and
by
pumping
and
working
arms
and
one
thing
and
another
it
long
before
binney
showed
signs
that
he
was
alive
in
half
an
hour
he
was
able
to
sit
up
and
move
around
sort
of
feeble
it
was
the
first
second
we
had
had
time
to
breathe
mark
tidd
stood
up
and
walked
over
to
motu
with
his
hand
out
says
he
any
that
will
do
for
a
thing
like
you
did
that
ever
be
paid
for
by
words
or
even
by
things
but
i
want
to
you
motu
none
of
those
samurai
in
your
country
have
got
you
beat
as
good
as
the
best
of
and
some
and
one
thing
you
can
depend
on
and
that
is
that
this
stick
to
you
and
work
for
you
and
for
you
till
they
motu
smiled
a
proud
grateful
sort
of
smile
and
took
hand
you
say
is
good
it
makes
me
fill
with
pride
i
am
joyful
your
binney
is
safe
and
i
am
joyful
it
was
motu
who
says
mark
better
be
ready
for
i
thought
so
too
the
japs
had
disappeared
behind
the
hotel
we
see
what
they
were
up
to
but
we
knew
mighty
well
it
was
something
that
be
good
for
us
the
siege
had
begun
chapter
xii
there
seem
to
be
much
of
anything
for
us
to
do
but
wait
till
the
besiegers
made
the
first
move
it
as
though
we
had
a
strong
garrison
and
could
make
sorties
the
best
we
could
hope
for
was
to
beat
off
attacks
the
odds
so
bad
five
boys
and
a
dog
against
five
japanese
men
but
the
odds
were
on
their
side
i
expect
of
course
they
had
to
come
to
us
and
they
had
to
cross
water
to
do
it
there
were
three
ways
of
swimming
which
motu
said
they
do
by
boat
and
they
any
boat
or
by
raft
which
would
be
easy
for
them
to
make
they
might
make
a
bridge
i
suppose
and
throw
it
across
but
it
seem
likely
the
thing
we
had
to
look
out
for
then
was
a
raft
both
of
us
had
good
generals
seen
enough
of
mark
tidd
in
pinches
to
know
that
you
can
depend
on
his
brain
to
do
the
best
thing
there
is
to
do
and
from
what
motu
said
and
from
what
we
had
seen
the
man
who
will
come
to
be
sneezed
at
if
it
been
for
him
i
have
had
much
worry
but
he
was
a
bad
one
while
i
was
thinking
about
him
what
should
he
do
but
walk
around
the
corner
of
the
hotel
and
call
over
to
us
from
his
side
of
the
moat
day
to
everybody
says
he
to
you
says
mark
i
am
feeling
splendidly
well
very
splendidly
well
indeed
you
have
pretty
little
bridges
that
go
up
in
air
with
sudden
surprisingness
says
he
and
grins
again
like
it
pretty
well
ourselves
says
mark
am
talking
says
the
man
who
will
come
purpose
of
argument
with
you
to
lowering
down
the
bridge
from
like
it
up
are
for
walking
across
waters
with
dry
feet
i
would
desire
to
walk
across
this
water
to
get
a
good
view
of
you
where
you
are
if
you
came
nearer
you
spoil
the
you
seen
little
bad
japanese
boy
that
goes
running
off
away
from
kind
fathers
and
uncles
says
he
with
another
broad
grin
i
guess
he
was
being
sarcastic
some
boy
mark
pretended
to
look
all
over
except
where
motu
was
standing
to
see
any
japanese
course
certainly
why
should
you
see
japanese
boy
for
not
any
reason
let
us
imagine
to
suppose
there
is
no
japanese
boy
eh
perfectly
if
there
is
not
any
why
do
you
have
bridge
up
in
the
air
for
lighting
on
by
birds
just
put
it
up
to
see
if
it
would
it
mark
added
that
last
with
an
aggravating
kind
of
a
grin
but
the
jap
grinned
right
back
have
select
friends
together
here
with
me
we
take
pleasure
if
we
can
come
across
we
are
anxious
with
desirability
to
come
across
i
have
lofely
dispositions
but
my
friends
oh
i
can
not
tell
sometimes
they
become
to
get
angry
quickly
do
you
see
if
you
should
not
let
to
allow
them
on
your
bridge
i
can
not
say
no
i
am
not
informed
what
it
is
they
might
says
mark
so
anxious
to
come
tell
to
have
made
imaginings
that
there
is
no
japanese
boy
now
let
us
make
imaginings
there
one
eh
so
that
japanese
boy
has
told
you
naughty
things
that
are
lie
oh
yes
but
the
truth
is
going
now
to
be
told
you
he
is
a
bad
boy
so
very
bad
a
boy
it
is
not
good
for
nice
boys
to
have
him
close
by
and
near
to
them
in
his
own
land
there
would
be
spanking
on
honorable
pants
for
him
because
he
is
so
bad
do
you
see
to
understand
says
mark
average
bad
ourselves
i
guess
your
imaginary
boy
do
us
any
the
man
who
will
come
grinned
again
as
and
friendly
as
possible
do
not
know
me
says
he
am
of
great
determinations
certainly
when
in
my
mind
i
say
a
thing
must
be
done
then
that
thing
shall
quickly
be
done
without
anybody
bothering
with
a
delay
am
i
clearly
plain
now
there
is
no
imaginings
there
is
talking
out
straight
from
shoulders
as
you
say
in
this
country
there
stands
japanese
boy
here
i
stand
i
am
come
for
that
boy
also
i
shall
not
go
away
and
depart
without
him
if
you
american
boys
pull
down
and
lower
your
bridge
and
give
up
the
japanese
boy
there
shall
be
no
harm
not
the
slightness
of
sounds
good
says
mark
want
any
done
but
just
we
get
around
to
up
any
japanese
boys
what
if
we
wanted
a
japanese
boy
ourselves
what
then
says
the
man
friends
and
i
myself
shall
take
the
boy
we
shall
come
across
by
bridge
or
otherwise
as
the
case
may
be
we
can
not
be
cautiously
careful
to
hurt
anybody
can
we
no
it
would
not
be
certainly
possible
so
we
come
then
you
look
out
eh
he
grinned
and
swung
his
little
stick
just
as
if
he
was
a
summer
visitor
chatting
pleasant
about
the
weather
you
says
mark
hear
some
facts
a
japanese
boy
here
and
his
at
that
the
man
looked
sort
of
surprised
and
turned
to
squint
at
motu
like
he
quite
understand
says
mark
owe
that
boy
of
a
debt
the
kind
now
then
motu
if
you
want
him
mister
come
and
get
him
says
the
man
we
know
do
not
we
each
knows
the
intention
that
he
hopes
to
do
that
makes
it
better
good
day
to
day
says
mark
if
i
was
you
think
it
over
a
little
before
i
started
a
on
this
shore
a
hot
shore
and
to
burn
your
the
man
turned
with
the
politest
kind
of
a
bow
and
walked
away
as
jaunty
as
the
tenor
in
the
wicksville
choir
says
mark
of
you
get
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
citadel
to
see
if
you
see
been
suspicious
that
the
man
come
just
to
talk
but
to
keep
us
interested
while
he
tried
something
where
we
see
and
mark
was
right
plunk
and
i
scooted
around
where
we
could
see
the
other
side
and
there
about
thirty
feet
off
was
a
jap
hanging
on
to
a
short
log
with
one
arm
and
paddling
toward
us
as
fast
and
as
quietly
as
he
could
he
see
us
we
do
says
plunk
him
a
little
says
i
need
to
hurt
him
but
make
him
think
to
get
a
good
swat
on
the
i
picked
up
a
stone
from
the
beach
and
heaved
it
it
land
more
than
two
feet
from
the
jap
and
it
made
an
awful
splash
you
can
bet
he
quit
paddling
sudden
and
stuck
up
his
head
to
see
what
was
going
on
at
that
plunk
let
a
rock
fly
it
hit
the
log
just
ahead
of
jap
and
bounded
off
down
went
his
head
so
nothing
but
his
nose
showed
and
he
began
to
back
away
well
sir
for
three
or
four
minutes
we
had
enough
fun
with
that
fellow
to
last
us
a
week
we
heaved
rocks
on
every
side
of
him
and
some
of
them
close
enough
to
make
it
pretty
uncomfortable
we
could
have
hit
him
if
wanted
to
but
we
in
the
first
place
mark
tidd
have
liked
it
and
in
the
second
place
we
have
liked
it
ourselves
war
but
no
use
doing
more
damage
than
you
have
to
do
to
get
results
and
we
got
them
all
right
that
jap
had
enough
swimming
on
a
log
to
last
him
when
he
got
to
shore
he
floundered
out
and
the
way
he
skinned
for
shelter
was
enough
to
get
a
laugh
out
of
a
man
that
had
just
hit
his
thumb
with
a
hammer
we
whizzed
a
couple
more
stones
past
him
and
then
gave
the
order
to
stop
firing
mark
said
the
scheme
was
to
sneak
a
man
on
the
island
who
would
creep
around
and
cut
the
rope
that
held
the
bridge
well
that
was
the
first
skirmish
and
we
had
come
out
on
top
it
made
us
all
feel
pretty
good
but
all
the
same
we
realized
there
been
much
to
it
we
knew
that
before
very
long
have
more
to
do
than
shy
rocks
at
a
man
in
the
water
who
shy
back
again
all
at
once
i
remembered
the
canoe
binney
had
tipped
over
in
i
looked
and
there
it
was
floating
bottom
side
up
about
thirty
feet
from
shore
and
in
shallow
water
where
anybody
could
wade
out
to
it
i
wait
for
anybody
to
tell
me
but
just
took
a
header
off
the
dock
clothes
and
all
and
swam
out
into
the
lake
i
knew
better
than
to
swim
right
for
that
canoe
because
that
would
attract
attention
to
it
but
as
soon
as
i
thought
it
was
safe
i
turned
and
swam
for
it
faster
than
i
ever
swam
before
in
my
life
when
i
was
about
twenty
feet
from
it
i
heard
a
yell
and
saw
a
jap
racing
down
from
the
hotel
to
get
to
the
canoe
first
at
the
same
time
i
heard
another
yell
from
the
citadel
and
a
rock
whizzed
past
jap
it
stop
him
a
bit
though
he
came
right
on
so
did
the
rocks
and
i
be
surprised
if
this
time
plunk
and
binney
were
really
trying
to
hit
the
jap
rushed
into
the
water
and
about
that
time
i
got
my
toe
on
the
bottom
and
splashed
toward
the
canoe
he
got
to
one
end
just
as
i
got
to
the
other
i
jerked
and
he
jerked
but
he
was
strongest
for
myself
i
afraid
for
whenever
i
wanted
to
i
could
turn
tail
and
swim
to
safety
but
i
want
those
men
to
have
that
canoe
so
i
set
my
heels
and
tugged
like
a
good
one
it
any
good
little
by
little
he
jerked
me
toward
the
shore
and
i
was
about
ready
to
give
up
when
i
heard
a
sharp
little
and
the
jap
let
out
a
squeal
right
after
came
another
spat
and
i
saw
mark
tidd
taking
aim
with
his
slingshot
now
mark
was
about
the
best
shot
with
a
sling
in
michigan
he
let
go
the
pebble
and
but
it
was
a
good
shot
it
plunked
the
jap
right
on
the
hand
he
yelped
and
let
go
and
in
that
second
i
snatched
the
canoe
away
from
him
and
gave
it
a
push
toward
deep
water
illustration
little
by
little
he
jerked
me
toward
the
shore
he
recovered
himself
quick
and
jumped
after
it
but
i
had
time
to
give
it
another
push
and
that
carried
it
out
over
his
head
says
i
you
wish
learned
to
swim
when
you
was
a
boy
he
made
a
jump
for
me
mad
as
a
hornet
but
i
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
i
took
the
heel
of
my
hand
and
just
skipped
the
top
of
the
water
with
it
you
know
how
to
do
it
it
shoots
a
shower
into
the
other
face
and
blinds
him
for
a
minute
i
shot
a
couple
into
face
and
then
swam
away
without
hurrying
over
it
in
a
second
i
caught
up
with
the
canoe
and
towed
it
to
the
citadel
where
we
pulled
it
up
on
shore
says
mark
for
gallantry
under
and
for
presence
of
mind
in
an
that
made
me
feel
pretty
good
for
mark
praise
unless
praise
is
earned
motu
came
over
too
and
says
was
very
well
done
some
day
you
will
be
a
leader
of
i
guess
i
blushed
mark
walked
around
the
place
a
couple
of
times
to
get
the
lay
of
the
land
i
expect
though
goodness
knows
he
ought
to
have
known
it
by
heart
before
at
any
rate
he
had
looked
it
over
enough
so
you
will
understand
tell
you
just
how
the
citadel
lay
maybe
it
would
be
best
to
furnish
you
with
a
little
map
of
the
hotel
and
the
island
where
the
citadel
was
for
you
can
always
tell
better
by
a
map
than
any
other
way
so
find
a
map
alongside
some
place
the
citadel
was
about
fifty
feet
square
and
three
stories
high
the
back
of
it
was
built
on
spiles
in
the
lake
one
side
was
toward
the
hotel
the
other
side
faced
out
toward
a
sort
of
strait
that
connected
the
two
parts
of
the
lake
and
between
the
house
and
the
water
was
a
little
patch
of
land
with
some
tall
hemlocks
on
it
in
front
was
nothing
but
a
dock
about
twenty
feet
broad
and
there
you
are
mark
came
back
with
his
plan
for
mounting
guard
in
his
head
be
necessary
to
have
guards
at
once
says
he
have
to
regular
beats
one
beat
will
be
from
the
bridge
around
the
front
of
the
citadel
to
the
end
of
the
dock
the
other
will
be
around
the
of
the
island
from
the
dock
to
the
back
end
of
the
house
the
day
turns
will
be
one
hour
long
at
night
be
hours
so
as
to
give
each
fellow
a
chance
to
sleep
a
little
betweentimes
of
us
which
will
give
one
man
a
chance
to
sleep
all
night
every
night
and
get
we
see
at
night
says
plunk
says
mark
two
good
fires
one
in
front
and
one
back
by
the
the
alarm
be
says
binney
be
the
alarm
just
make
the
you
think
of
first
so
loud
enough
do
all
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
guess
nobody
had
any
complaint
to
make
about
alarms
if
they
were
as
loud
as
i
was
scared
every
time
i
had
to
make
an
alarm
bet
they
were
heard
on
the
pacific
coast
and
i
had
to
make
them
too
forget
about
that
there
were
alarms
enough
to
satisfy
appetite
chapter
xiii
see
says
i
we
just
as
well
pile
into
a
boat
and
row
to
the
far
end
of
the
lake
from
there
we
could
make
tracks
for
town
and
save
all
this
mark
tidd
just
looked
at
me
disgusted
far
is
it
to
says
he
miles
says
i
lead
think
get
on
the
japs
by
to
the
end
of
the
lake
or
so
says
i
those
men
could
run
there
as
fast
as
we
could
row
gain
some
but
in
the
miles
to
town
catch
us
and
a
chance
i
guess
he
was
right
about
it
we
were
safer
where
we
were
though
have
liked
more
water
between
us
than
there
was
ames
ought
to
be
here
in
three
days
says
binney
be
says
mark
five
be
close
to
scared
to
death
of
one
lame
old
man
why
ames
as
much
in
him
as
any
one
of
he
might
fetch
somebody
with
him
says
plunk
what
got
to
hope
for
says
mark
main
thing
right
now
is
to
keep
off
the
japanese
till
ames
does
come
three
days
is
a
says
i
it
would
be
a
heap
longer
if
we
have
plenty
of
says
binney
well
sir
five
minutes
after
that
you
could
have
bought
the
whole
crowd
for
a
cent
with
a
hole
in
it
we
got
everything
ready
to
cook
and
fixed
wood
and
kindling
for
the
nobody
had
a
match
we
searched
our
pockets
and
turned
them
inside
out
then
we
rummaged
through
everything
we
had
brought
over
to
the
citadel
from
the
hotel
and
as
a
last
resort
we
scoured
the
whole
citadel
to
see
if
somebody
left
one
laying
around
by
accident
but
there
a
match
coffee
says
binney
grunted
mark
me
is
no
we
might
peg
along
somehow
with
the
grub
got
but
we
get
along
without
fire
make
fire
like
the
savages
do
says
i
a
stick
with
a
point
to
it
and
whirl
it
around
in
a
hole
in
another
i
was
wrecked
on
a
island
says
mark
there
any
other
way
i
might
try
that
probably
take
a
to
get
the
things
fixed
just
right
work
no
a
way
than
is
it
says
i
get
the
box
of
on
the
kitchen
shelf
in
the
says
i
call
and
ask
the
man
who
will
come
to
toss
all
the
fun
you
can
out
of
it
says
mark
elected
says
i
the
best
time
says
i
learn
to
think
be
much
danger
says
mark
fix
up
a
decoy
how
can
you
swim
under
water
tallow
or
sixty
feet
says
i
seen
you
do
that
first
send
out
plunk
in
the
canoe
start
out
from
the
wharf
and
along
the
shore
about
two
hundred
out
take
a
cloth
and
wave
it
to
somebody
on
the
far
shore
i
interest
the
japs
some
eh
sort
of
give
the
idea
reinforcements
are
says
i
where
do
i
come
in
show
you
that
as
soon
as
does
he
go
says
mark
all
got
to
do
is
just
slide
across
and
fetch
a
supply
of
matches
says
i
under
water
with
i
keep
dry
and
while
there
i
better
fetch
along
the
kitchen
stove
could
just
as
to
be
busy
says
mark
yourself
out
to
be
funny
do
your
when
you
get
back
with
the
illustration
i
could
get
into
the
water
without
the
least
bit
of
danger
of
seeing
me
we
pushed
off
the
canoe
and
plunk
started
out
with
a
lying
handy
for
him
to
wave
he
paddled
until
he
got
opposite
the
porch
of
the
hotel
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
acted
as
if
he
was
looking
for
something
on
the
far
shore
of
the
lake
after
watched
a
minute
he
rose
up
as
high
as
he
dared
without
tipping
over
and
began
to
wave
like
he
had
gone
crazy
he
flapped
that
around
his
head
in
circles
and
back
and
forth
and
up
and
down
at
the
same
time
letting
out
a
holler
as
if
he
was
tickled
to
death
about
something
as
soon
as
was
performing
i
got
ready
for
the
main
act
mark
took
me
into
the
citadel
where
we
pried
up
a
loose
plank
in
the
floor
that
part
of
the
building
was
built
on
spiles
right
over
the
water
so
all
i
had
to
do
was
let
myself
through
that
way
i
could
get
into
the
water
without
the
least
bit
of
danger
of
seeing
me
the
water
was
up
to
my
neck
under
the
floor
and
got
deeper
toward
the
edge
i
found
that
out
all
by
myself
it
take
any
help
at
all
all
i
did
was
to
take
one
step
and
into
a
hole
i
went
it
have
been
so
bad
if
i
been
talking
to
mark
at
that
minute
but
i
was
i
guess
i
must
have
been
saying
a
big
word
because
my
mouth
was
as
far
open
as
i
could
get
it
when
you
duck
suddenly
under
water
with
your
mouth
wide
open
the
pleasure
you
get
out
of
it
is
very
small
if
lake
ravona
been
a
pretty
body
of
water
have
swallowed
all
of
it
and
left
the
fish
flopping
on
dry
land
as
it
was
i
did
my
best
and
lowered
the
level
considerable
when
i
came
up
choking
and
splashing
and
close
to
drowned
to
death
mark
tidd
was
laughing
fit
to
split
if
you
can
of
humorous
to
say
now
tallow
been
unusual
funny
these
few
days
like
to
have
down
here
says
i
bet
make
you
think
of
pretty
your
head
says
he
still
shaking
all
over
like
a
plate
of
jelly
swim
under
water
to
the
back
of
the
hotel
you
can
crawl
in
through
the
kitchen
window
and
get
out
again
without
anybody
i
was
mad
but
there
anything
to
do
but
swallow
it
and
wait
for
a
chance
to
get
even
so
i
took
a
sight
for
the
place
where
i
wanted
to
land
and
dived
swimming
under
water
is
all
right
when
you
do
it
for
fun
and
when
you
do
it
in
water
you
know
all
about
but
here
i
doing
it
for
from
i
know
much
about
the
water
i
was
pretty
confident
there
any
spiles
or
boulders
between
me
and
shore
to
split
my
head
against
but
i
a
heap
of
difference
between
being
pretty
sure
and
an
ounce
of
is
better
than
a
ton
of
i
took
it
as
easy
and
cautious
as
i
could
and
after
been
swimming
ahead
till
i
thought
my
lungs
would
burst
if
i
get
a
breath
of
air
my
knees
scraped
the
bottom
got
as
far
as
i
could
go
under
water
so
i
crouched
down
with
nothing
but
my
nose
and
eyes
above
water
and
spied
around
a
bit
i
see
a
soul
any
place
so
i
crept
in
nearer
and
got
out
on
shore
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
the
kitchen
window
far
now
so
i
made
a
break
for
it
when
i
got
to
it
i
stopped
again
and
looked
all
around
as
well
as
inside
it
looked
safe
if
only
things
were
always
as
safe
as
they
look
it
would
be
fine
it
but
not
i
pulled
myself
up
and
scrambled
inside
it
very
light
in
there
but
i
could
see
as
well
as
i
needed
any
rate
i
thought
i
could
anyhow
i
found
my
way
across
to
the
shelf
and
grabbed
a
large
package
of
matches
then
i
turned
and
scuttled
across
to
the
window
got
in
at
right
there
was
a
surprise
party
for
the
worst
one
i
ever
got
i
raised
my
head
above
the
edge
of
the
window
and
looked
out
while
i
was
doing
that
a
japanese
outside
was
raising
his
head
above
the
level
of
the
window
to
look
in
we
almost
rubbed
noses
it
was
a
close
race
to
see
who
was
most
startled
but
i
guess
i
won
i
figure
i
did
because
he
have
been
looking
in
that
way
if
he
expected
to
see
something
i
expecting
any
sights
and
need
any
i
could
have
got
along
fine
without
seeing
any
japanese
just
then
i
let
go
and
dropped
back
quick
it
was
pretty
plain
i
get
out
the
way
i
got
in
and
it
was
just
as
sure
i
was
in
a
bad
box
been
discovered
and
stood
a
chance
of
being
trapped
right
there
in
the
kitchen
i
bolted
my
main
idea
was
to
get
anywhere
else
i
so
much
care
where
i
wanted
to
move
and
move
quick
i
did
too
through
the
and
into
the
office
where
i
stopped
a
second
to
breathe
and
see
if
i
could
think
outside
i
could
hear
plunk
yelling
and
cheering
like
he
was
at
a
baseball
game
whether
the
jap
who
discovered
me
did
any
yelling
to
give
the
alarm
i
know
i
found
i
do
a
very
job
of
thinking
so
i
says
to
myself
that
if
i
think
better
run
anyhow
i
ran
this
time
i
headed
because
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
who
will
come
outside
watching
plunk
and
though
i
see
any
more
i
believed
other
japanese
were
with
him
if
had
any
hopes
of
escaping
out
of
the
front
door
they
went
glimmering
i
scooted
down
the
long
corridor
toward
the
other
end
of
the
hotel
partly
because
it
was
about
the
only
way
i
go
and
partly
to
get
nearer
to
the
citadel
i
wanted
to
get
a
chance
to
warn
mark
tidd
of
the
predicament
i
was
in
if
i
could
i
suppose
i
could
have
gone
on
to
the
third
floor
and
hidden
in
old
den
but
the
matches
kept
weighing
on
my
mind
if
i
holed
up
like
a
frightened
fox
and
took
the
matches
with
me
mark
and
the
fellows
would
be
in
a
bad
fix
that
night
i
made
up
my
mind
get
the
matches
across
somehow
no
matter
what
happened
to
me
that
was
why
i
wanted
to
get
near
the
citadel
if
i
could
attract
attention
i
could
heave
the
matches
over
to
him
and
then
have
my
mind
free
to
look
out
for
myself
about
down
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
ahead
of
me
and
stopped
quick
sure
enough
there
was
a
sound
it
was
somebody
coming
up
the
back
stairs
probably
to
head
me
off
that
made
me
listen
back
the
way
come
right
then
and
there
i
pretty
nearly
quit
and
curled
up
on
the
floor
like
one
of
those
little
green
worms
does
when
you
touch
it
with
a
stick
i
go
either
way
all
the
choice
i
had
was
which
room
hide
in
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
stop
to
choose
but
just
bobbed
into
the
nearest
doorway
by
luck
the
key
was
in
the
door
and
i
turned
it
then
i
tiptoed
to
the
window
but
it
was
too
far
to
jump
or
drop
without
taking
a
big
chance
of
spraining
an
ankle
over
at
one
side
was
a
door
that
opened
into
a
bathroom
and
the
bathroom
opened
into
another
room
and
the
other
room
opened
into
another
room
a
regular
suite
it
was
then
i
got
an
idea
if
i
do
say
it
myself
it
was
about
as
good
as
mark
tidd
could
have
done
in
the
circumstances
i
had
already
locked
the
hall
door
quick
as
a
wink
i
ran
to
it
and
banged
against
it
like
i
was
trying
to
get
out
or
had
slipped
and
fallen
against
it
then
i
scooted
through
the
bathroom
door
and
locked
that
after
that
i
just
went
headlong
but
as
quietly
as
i
could
go
into
the
third
room
you
see
i
figured
the
japanese
would
hear
the
noise
and
when
they
found
the
door
locked
would
think
i
was
there
then
if
they
tried
the
next
room
and
the
bath
find
door
locked
and
because
i
had
the
key
right
in
my
pocket
be
more
than
liable
to
suppose
it
was
locked
on
the
that
would
make
them
dead
certain
i
was
in
there
while
they
were
trying
to
break
in
and
catch
me
be
making
tracks
now
mark
tidd
or
not
i
think
that
was
a
good
scheme
i
get
up
a
scheme
very
often
so
when
i
do
i
want
folks
to
know
about
it
and
sort
of
appreciate
it
this
scheme
worked
i
heard
a
man
rush
by
the
door
of
the
room
where
i
crouched
then
as
plain
as
day
i
heard
him
meet
another
fellow
in
front
of
the
locked
door
they
jabbered
a
minute
in
their
funny
language
and
after
a
minute
they
rattled
on
the
door
says
a
man
of
course
nobody
answered
he
says
again
we
ahead
i
thought
to
myself
what
i
want
you
to
but
they
the
door
down
they
went
into
the
next
room
and
i
expect
found
the
bathroom
and
the
other
locked
door
i
know
they
did
for
i
heard
them
bang
on
it
and
yell
again
both
of
them
yelled
i
knew
then
that
the
hall
was
clear
so
i
opened
my
door
and
scooted
my
bare
feet
make
much
noise
and
i
got
to
the
top
of
the
back
stairs
all
right
but
i
go
down
what
was
down
there
i
know
but
i
did
know
that
nobody
was
straight
straight
ahead
took
me
nearer
to
the
citadel
there
was
a
turn
in
the
corridor
that
hid
me
from
anybody
behind
so
i
slacked
down
so
as
not
to
make
a
particle
of
sound
into
the
very
last
room
i
went
it
had
a
side
window
that
looked
right
out
on
the
little
strait
that
separated
me
from
the
citadel
you
can
guess
it
take
me
long
to
throw
up
that
window
and
look
out
the
man
who
will
come
was
still
on
the
beach
watching
plunk
across
on
the
dock
was
mark
tidd
i
stop
to
think
but
just
let
out
a
yell
at
mark
he
turned
but
see
me
for
a
second
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
i
drew
back
my
arm
and
threw
the
matches
as
far
toward
him
as
i
could
they
landed
safe
he
picked
them
up
and
waved
his
hand
i
took
a
look
toward
the
man
who
will
come
and
saw
that
he
saw
me
for
he
was
coming
on
the
run
it
was
my
move
all
right
so
i
began
by
getting
out
of
that
room
into
the
hall
the
door
opposite
was
open
and
i
took
a
chance
on
going
in
outside
its
back
window
was
the
roof
of
a
sort
of
porch
off
the
kitchen
it
was
built
on
spiles
and
stood
maybe
six
or
eight
feet
into
the
water
out
on
that
porch
i
got
and
not
a
minute
too
soon
for
those
two
japanese
had
smelled
me
out
and
came
tearing
in
at
the
door
i
much
time
to
figure
i
was
cornered
the
only
way
off
that
porch
was
through
the
window
and
the
japanese
were
between
that
and
the
of
the
nicest
little
traps
you
ever
saw
well
there
was
just
one
thing
for
me
to
do
i
knew
how
deep
the
water
was
below
it
was
a
good
seven
feet
the
drop
was
a
little
over
as
mark
tidd
said
i
was
the
best
swimmer
and
diver
in
the
bunch
i
jumped
to
the
edge
poised
a
second
and
dove
it
much
of
a
dive
taken
higher
ones
but
the
water
was
pretty
shallow
still
there
really
such
a
terrible
risk
to
it
i
turned
as
soon
as
i
struck
the
water
and
though
i
touched
bottom
it
hard
enough
to
hurt
me
then
i
struck
out
for
the
citadel
the
rest
was
easy
mark
tidd
was
there
to
help
me
climb
out
and
so
was
motu
have
to
get
a
struck
off
for
him
we
motu
says
mark
shall
have
a
thing
better
than
many
medals
says
motu
am
glad
i
saw
it
i
will
make
it
into
a
song
myself
leap
of
tallow
it
shall
be
shucks
says
i
but
all
the
same
i
was
just
a
bit
pleased
with
myself
mark
saw
that
like
he
sees
everything
and
calculated
it
was
his
duty
to
take
me
down
a
peg
the
you
figure
motu
says
he
have
landed
on
his
you
know
and
that
have
hurt
chapter
xiv
our
supper
was
a
little
late
that
night
but
it
tasted
all
the
better
for
that
before
we
ate
mark
insisted
on
our
building
the
two
and
somebody
was
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
country
every
minute
when
it
gets
dark
at
lake
ravona
it
just
fool
around
with
it
it
gets
right
down
to
business
and
turns
out
darkness
there
any
moon
but
there
were
seven
million
stars
which
only
made
it
seem
blacker
than
it
was
outside
the
circle
where
our
fires
threw
light
you
see
any
more
than
as
if
you
were
trying
to
look
through
a
black
curtain
motu
and
plunk
drew
the
watch
for
the
first
part
of
the
night
and
mark
and
i
went
up
to
the
second
floor
of
the
citadel
to
sleep
before
we
turned
in
we
stepped
out
on
the
roof
of
the
porch
to
look
around
below
we
could
see
the
fires
blazing
and
a
dark
figure
standing
by
each
of
them
plunk
was
by
the
one
in
front
of
the
citadel
and
motu
was
near
the
other
seem
real
does
it
i
says
like
a
dream
or
says
mark
mean
just
what
we
fires
and
the
whole
in
here
we
are
four
boys
from
michigan
way
up
here
in
the
mountains
in
a
ramshackle
hotel
by
ourselves
when
we
expected
to
be
staying
at
a
swell
summer
resort
that
seem
real
but
when
you
add
to
it
that
got
a
war
on
our
hands
all
on
account
of
a
mysterious
japanese
boy
who
appears
from
nowhere
and
add
to
that
again
that
the
enemy
is
a
party
of
japanese
men
trying
to
get
that
it
pretty
nearly
flabbergasts
me
it
so
is
says
mark
been
it
over
quite
a
make
of
it
much
the
mystery
if
we
knew
what
here
or
if
we
knew
who
he
was
then
we
could
make
a
guess
yes
he
says
sort
of
and
motu
is
that
is
the
real
can
bet
says
i
he
just
a
common
boy
like
you
and
heard
of
anybody
a
citadel
just
to
get
their
hands
on
either
of
us
did
you
yet
says
i
or
says
mark
mighty
secret
about
it
too
got
a
right
to
be
if
he
wants
to
but
it
sure
makes
me
says
i
know
some
tell
says
mark
one
of
those
kind
of
that
ever
be
says
i
be
doggone
would
says
mark
go
to
about
the
next
thing
i
remember
was
plunk
shaking
me
to
tell
me
his
watch
was
over
it
seem
like
shut
my
eyes
at
all
happen
says
i
a
thing
says
he
got
a
big
fire
and
a
couple
of
them
are
in
front
of
it
but
they
made
a
move
just
us
i
mark
and
i
went
down
to
mount
guard
sure
enough
they
had
a
big
and
a
couple
of
them
were
crouching
in
front
of
it
mark
and
i
walked
up
and
down
and
up
and
down
but
nobody
stirred
for
hours
it
kept
on
just
like
that
somehow
i
got
a
feeling
that
nothing
was
going
to
happen
and
i
told
mark
so
the
apt
to
happen
says
he
man
who
will
come
is
to
make
us
feel
that
way
and
as
soon
as
we
act
careless
down
be
on
but
i
was
right
for
once
morning
came
without
a
hostile
act
by
the
enemy
it
was
just
five
when
mark
and
i
turned
in
and
we
slept
till
nine
have
slept
longer
if
binney
set
up
a
yell
he
says
a
boat
down
the
we
hustled
out
to
see
pretty
hopeful
all
of
a
sudden
it
looked
like
the
siege
was
ended
and
reinforcements
were
coming
the
boat
was
way
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
lake
and
we
could
just
see
it
and
two
figures
sitting
in
it
rowing
it
was
headed
our
way
bet
ames
come
ahead
of
time
binney
says
beginning
to
dance
up
and
down
he
was
so
excited
mark
say
anything
and
he
look
glad
only
worried
and
puzzled
the
matter
says
i
on
and
join
the
never
firecrackers
till
the
fourth
of
july
says
he
which
was
as
much
as
to
tell
us
we
were
getting
happy
ahead
of
time
the
boat
come
very
fast
because
the
wind
was
blowing
right
in
its
face
when
it
came
near
enough
so
we
could
make
out
to
see
men
in
it
we
could
tell
they
were
pretty
poor
boatmen
they
did
more
splashing
than
they
did
rowing
and
then
we
saw
they
were
japanese
somewhere
around
the
lake
they
had
found
an
old
scow
says
mark
with
a
long
breath
got
a
says
i
better
strengthen
our
says
mark
the
man
who
will
come
will
try
to
take
the
citadel
by
due
to
load
his
army
aboard
his
navy
and
attack
if
we
can
beat
them
back
once
he
try
it
again
be
stratagems
have
to
look
out
boys
and
a
dog
says
binney
that
says
mark
with
the
sort
of
look
he
wears
when
got
an
unpleasant
surprise
waiting
for
somebody
have
quite
a
sizable
army
when
the
time
to
enlist
the
fish
says
plunk
if
i
had
to
says
mark
and
bet
he
have
found
some
way
to
use
them
if
to
the
japanese
began
to
stir
around
and
pretty
soon
they
started
for
the
boat
mark
began
giving
orders
and
plunk
strongest
get
those
two
long
inside
put
spikes
in
regular
use
to
fend
off
the
boat
jab
the
spikes
in
the
boat
and
keep
from
the
shore
you
ought
to
be
able
to
hold
ten
feet
aye
sir
says
plunk
he
turned
and
scooted
into
the
citadel
as
fast
as
his
size
would
let
him
and
that
was
faster
than
you
would
expect
in
a
jiffy
he
was
back
with
a
couple
of
poles
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
and
eight
feet
long
with
a
big
pad
like
a
on
the
end
of
each
been
making
them
on
the
quiet
while
the
rest
of
us
were
fooling
around
and
binney
take
these
lances
says
he
a
steps
off
a
boat
he
balanced
very
well
if
anybody
gets
to
land
jab
this
into
his
stomach
and
poke
him
back
keep
the
lances
handy
for
close
work
use
your
slingshots
for
artillery
as
soon
as
the
boat
starts
out
open
fire
aim
for
the
of
the
men
are
you
to
do
says
i
mark
sort
of
chuckled
upstairs
where
safe
says
he
that
was
a
joke
all
right
mark
tidd
the
sort
of
fellow
to
hunt
a
hole
when
his
chums
were
running
risks
so
i
knew
he
had
some
sort
of
a
scheme
whizzing
in
his
head
it
stiffened
my
spine
in
a
second
when
it
comes
to
strategy
i
take
off
my
hat
to
mark
we
kept
our
eyes
on
the
japanese
who
were
getting
into
the
old
scow
they
used
to
boats
and
had
a
pretty
tough
time
pushing
off
and
getting
under
way
but
when
they
got
started
they
came
like
they
meant
business
the
man
who
will
come
was
standing
up
in
the
stern
two
japs
were
rowing
and
two
sat
all
ready
to
attack
as
soon
as
they
landed
they
had
to
row
about
two
hundred
feet
binney
and
i
held
our
fire
till
they
were
a
hundred
feet
off
then
we
let
fly
we
hit
any
fingers
at
that
distance
but
we
knocked
some
dust
out
of
a
couple
of
pairs
of
pants
we
could
see
the
japanese
jump
and
squirm
for
those
pebbles
hit
plenty
hard
and
stung
enough
to
make
anybody
wish
he
had
on
a
suit
of
armor
we
kept
up
a
steady
fire
and
plunk
joined
in
while
they
were
too
far
away
to
reach
with
his
pole
none
of
us
bothered
with
the
man
who
will
come
it
was
the
machinery
we
wanted
to
damage
and
the
two
rowers
were
the
engine
i
was
sort
of
sorry
for
those
fellows
because
they
caught
it
and
caught
it
good
at
last
binney
plunked
one
fellow
right
on
the
knuckles
he
got
half
out
of
his
seat
let
out
a
howl
and
dropped
his
oar
overboard
that
made
the
boat
swing
around
sideways
the
man
who
will
come
lose
his
jaunty
air
for
a
minute
he
just
spoke
low
to
the
man
who
reached
out
quick
and
got
his
oar
they
pulled
around
straight
and
came
on
again
binney
and
i
kept
on
peppering
them
good
i
had
the
luck
to
smack
my
man
on
the
hand
but
he
drop
his
oar
he
missed
a
stroke
though
the
man
who
will
come
fixed
his
round
glass
in
one
eye
and
beamed
at
us
as
jovial
as
could
be
leetle
boys
make
a
stopping
do
not
throwing
stones
my
men
will
get
to
become
angry
if
you
hurt
them
some
hurt
says
i
and
gave
him
one
for
luck
it
struck
him
on
the
elbow
must
have
hit
his
i
guess
for
he
act
quite
so
happy
and
began
rubbing
the
spot
that
says
he
shall
make
a
spanking
on
you
when
you
are
might
as
well
be
a
spanking
says
i
and
let
him
have
another
volleys
says
mark
tidd
from
way
up
above
binney
and
i
tried
it
call
and
both
let
go
plunk
too
it
worked
fine
mark
began
to
shoot
too
and
you
know
what
a
shot
he
was
with
the
sling
well
sir
we
stopped
them
the
men
at
the
oars
turned
and
grumbled
something
to
their
commander
he
said
something
back
but
they
shook
their
heads
he
stopped
smiling
and
spoke
louder
in
japanese
now
he
smiling
but
you
could
see
his
teeth
just
the
same
his
eyes
were
half
shut
and
glinting
and
he
leaned
forward
like
he
was
going
to
leap
the
men
were
more
afraid
of
him
than
they
were
of
getting
hurt
for
they
picked
up
their
oars
once
more
the
commander
says
mark
three
to
the
mark
shot
fast
and
every
pebble
struck
i
could
see
them
spat
against
the
man
they
were
only
about
thirty
feet
away
now
and
shooting
was
easy
we
shot
faster
than
ever
spat
spat
spat
spat
went
the
pebbles
mark
had
the
man
fidgeting
good
and
plenty
and
we
had
the
poor
rowers
about
as
uncomfortable
as
men
can
be
at
last
it
got
to
be
too
much
for
the
man
himself
and
when
the
rowers
stopped
again
he
said
something
and
they
turned
the
boat
and
began
to
retreat
we
helped
them
to
spank
me
be
you
says
i
to
the
man
he
turned
and
grinned
and
waved
his
little
cane
is
but
the
beginning
of
the
commencement
says
he
of
time
for
spankings
is
yet
left
show
you
how
it
feels
says
i
and
gave
him
one
right
where
have
spanked
me
he
quit
standing
up
without
a
delay
i
guess
he
figured
rather
be
hit
some
place
else
by
a
pebble
well
i
accommodated
him
says
mark
and
we
all
threw
our
hats
in
the
air
and
yelled
it
was
the
first
big
battle
of
the
campaign
they
had
tried
a
straight
frontal
attack
as
mark
called
it
but
strategy
and
his
disposition
of
his
artillery
had
won
the
battle
so
far
we
had
come
out
ahead
every
place
from
the
beginning
but
the
end
was
a
long
way
off
leave
your
places
says
mark
be
chapter
xv
the
enemy
rowed
back
and
got
out
of
their
boat
some
of
them
acted
pretty
lame
too
they
hunched
around
and
rubbed
sore
spots
while
we
gave
them
the
laugh
all
of
them
went
up
to
the
hotel
where
after
a
while
we
heard
them
hammering
and
hammering
a
modern
navy
says
mark
vessels
went
out
of
style
when
the
steamed
into
hampton
go
out
of
style
too
they
says
i
be
quite
so
useful
anyhow
mark
says
i
better
hang
onto
eyes
were
shining
he
looked
about
as
happy
as
ever
seen
anybody
look
was
a
great
battle
says
he
father
has
told
me
stories
of
the
battles
of
ancient
warriors
of
japan
this
was
like
them
when
i
come
again
to
my
country
this
day
shall
be
spoken
of
with
pride
by
my
family
and
in
my
descendants
shall
tell
their
children
of
a
bit
says
mark
your
have
to
brag
about
this
battle
over
yet
by
several
more
fighting
the
more
glory
says
motu
now
i
feel
that
way
about
it
the
more
fighting
the
more
bother
was
my
notion
had
plenty
my
appetite
was
fed
up
and
i
have
any
use
for
a
second
helping
but
i
come
of
a
race
of
warriors
i
expect
my
way
of
looking
at
it
is
the
american
way
we
fight
for
glory
but
only
when
necessary
and
then
we
want
it
over
with
and
done
as
soon
as
possible
just
as
we
do
any
other
disagreeable
job
that
may
come
along
says
binney
around
the
corner
of
the
hotel
came
four
japanese
carrying
a
sort
of
fence
made
of
an
old
strip
of
carpet
nailed
on
posts
they
took
it
down
to
the
boat
and
the
man
showed
them
how
to
set
it
up
and
nail
it
in
place
so
that
the
front
and
both
sides
of
the
craft
were
sheltered
with
that
armor
a
fellow
see
the
rowers
at
all
in
fact
the
whole
five
of
them
could
sit
in
the
boat
and
we
get
a
crack
at
them
where
we
get
it
says
i
to
mark
says
he
you
fend
off
with
your
and
tallow
and
binney
you
to
anybody
that
reaches
over
to
meddle
with
the
poles
while
the
boat
get
the
idea
so
long
as
we
can
hold
off
the
boat
can
land
and
we
can
hold
off
the
boat
as
as
our
are
left
well
sir
have
to
admit
mark
was
some
general
that
idea
was
a
dandy
and
in
spite
of
their
new
armor
our
slingshots
would
be
useful
a
heap
and
then
there
was
mark
up
on
the
balcony
of
the
third
floor
and
he
could
shoot
right
down
on
top
of
the
japs
says
i
guess
those
old
warriors
of
never
had
a
better
general
than
mark
he
just
grinned
now
the
enemy
was
ready
to
attack
again
they
boarded
their
and
pushed
off
and
a
ship
they
had
of
course
the
rowers
see
where
they
were
going
and
so
somebody
had
to
stand
up
to
direct
them
the
man
took
the
job
of
being
pilot
so
we
had
something
to
shoot
at
from
the
beginning
this
time
there
was
no
chance
of
damaging
the
motive
power
but
we
could
make
the
pilot
wish
he
had
a
periscope
it
was
lucky
for
us
they
have
a
submarine
they
came
on
steady
and
sure
until
they
got
in
range
then
they
kept
on
just
as
steady
only
we
kept
the
man
hopping
by
the
time
they
got
within
a
hundred
feet
we
had
him
ducking
his
head
behind
the
armor
plate
and
only
sticking
it
up
to
take
a
peek
every
little
while
the
result
of
that
was
that
the
boat
did
quite
a
considerable
bit
of
zigzagging
however
they
kept
coming
and
at
last
they
were
near
enough
so
mark
tidd
could
get
a
shot
at
them
from
his
station
above
he
shot
fast
and
often
and
i
expect
those
japs
wished
their
leader
had
put
a
roof
on
their
shelter
but
no
matter
how
straight
and
how
fast
he
could
shoot
one
boy
hold
off
the
boat
with
a
sling
besides
it
was
difficult
shooting
so
in
a
couple
of
minutes
they
got
dangerously
near
to
shore
yelled
mark
motu
and
plunk
were
ready
they
jabbed
their
spikes
into
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
pushed
the
boat
stopped
sudden
and
swung
sideways
plunk
let
go
and
ran
along
till
he
could
spear
the
boat
near
the
stern
and
there
they
held
her
the
japs
tried
to
row
but
binney
and
i
grabbed
our
lances
with
the
pads
on
the
end
and
poked
at
their
paddles
so
they
do
a
thing
the
man
yelled
something
in
japanese
and
the
rowers
pulled
in
their
oars
in
a
second
one
of
them
stood
up
suddenly
and
smashed
at
with
his
he
might
have
hit
if
it
been
for
mark
and
binney
both
of
them
smacked
him
good
with
pebbles
and
he
ducked
the
best
part
of
it
was
that
he
dropped
his
oar
before
they
could
do
anything
to
recover
it
mark
yelled
to
me
to
get
it
which
i
did
with
my
pike
it
was
the
first
trophy
of
the
war
and
something
to
brag
about
like
real
soldiers
do
when
they
report
captured
so
many
of
the
cannon
or
some
such
thing
the
next
thing
they
tried
was
a
little
more
skilful
but
it
work
much
better
a
man
lifted
the
carpet
armor
a
little
at
the
bottom
and
shoved
through
his
arm
he
tried
to
grab
the
pike
and
jerk
it
away
from
motu
but
motu
had
jabbed
in
his
spike
good
and
he
pushed
like
a
trojan
the
man
make
much
headway
and
after
peppered
his
knuckles
a
couple
of
times
he
seem
anxious
to
keep
it
up
he
let
go
and
for
a
couple
of
minutes
nothing
happened
i
guess
the
man
who
will
come
was
holding
a
council
of
war
with
himself
after
that
they
tried
poking
their
oars
through
and
punching
at
the
with
them
and
that
was
a
better
scheme
than
any
of
the
rest
for
there
anything
for
our
artillery
to
aim
at
but
they
had
to
go
it
blind
nobody
seemed
to
want
to
stand
up
to
see
just
where
they
were
poking
so
they
have
very
good
luck
at
it
a
few
times
they
thumped
off
one
of
the
but
before
it
did
them
any
good
plunk
or
motu
would
jab
it
in
again
and
they
were
no
further
ahead
than
before
says
mark
to
the
man
you
know
history
that
land
defenses
be
taken
with
a
alone
take
all
right
says
the
man
from
behind
his
shelter
take
and
then
comes
punishings
ho
we
shall
give
it
up
says
mark
let
you
go
with
honors
of
you
have
our
bad
leetle
japanese
boy
give
him
up
to
us
and
we
make
lovely
speed
away
without
spankings
nobody
shall
have
a
to
that
says
mark
hate
to
be
give
him
up
yes
give
him
up
no
says
mark
at
that
quick
as
a
wink
the
man
stood
up
in
the
boat
with
an
oar
in
his
hand
of
course
all
three
of
us
shot
and
shot
like
fury
but
before
we
could
stop
him
he
swung
his
oar
over
his
head
and
brought
it
down
on
the
snapped
and
plunk
dropped
his
end
like
it
was
hot
i
guess
it
must
have
stung
his
hands
some
the
boat
was
held
only
by
now
and
its
stern
began
to
swing
toward
the
shore
that
so
bad
because
there
was
no
armor
plate
around
the
back
and
we
could
shoot
right
through
we
miss
any
time
doing
it
and
the
way
they
scrambled
to
swing
their
navy
around
was
a
caution
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
now
and
we
all
knew
it
the
man
could
stand
up
as
soon
as
he
was
ready
and
smash
pole
the
same
way
he
did
and
then
we
fellows
would
have
to
join
battle
with
our
lances
but
it
come
to
lances
just
then
all
of
a
sudden
mark
tidd
yelled
to
look
out
i
looked
up
instead
and
saw
him
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
balcony
with
a
big
pail
in
his
hands
he
held
it
like
he
like
the
job
very
well
i
could
see
he
had
a
cover
on
it
and
was
pretty
careful
to
keep
the
cover
in
place
out
fellows
says
he
again
and
then
heaved
over
the
pail
it
struck
square
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
and
in
a
second
i
heard
a
sound
i
recognized
it
was
an
angry
sound
the
kind
of
a
sound
you
want
to
get
away
from
and
right
on
top
of
it
we
heard
a
yell
and
then
another
yell
and
the
sound
of
a
wild
scramble
in
the
boat
but
through
all
the
noise
the
japanese
made
i
could
hear
that
low
angry
sound
it
was
a
sort
of
humming
singing
stinging
i
yelled
have
arrived
whoop
it
was
reinforcements
all
right
more
than
a
million
of
i
guess
and
a
million
of
the
best
and
meanest
fighters
in
the
world
we
could
begin
to
see
them
now
a
regular
cloud
of
them
and
we
could
see
the
enemy
was
in
a
bad
way
they
yelled
and
slapped
and
scrambled
and
squealed
while
our
allies
went
for
them
then
they
began
a
retreat
that
was
a
rout
with
only
three
oars
left
they
started
rowing
for
the
other
shore
and
in
spite
of
the
speed
they
made
which
was
considerable
bet
it
was
the
longest
ride
they
ever
took
just
before
they
got
to
shore
a
japanese
stood
up
and
jumped
out
of
the
boat
waving
his
arms
around
his
head
and
yelling
another
was
right
on
his
heels
and
the
rest
followed
in
quick
order
the
man
who
will
come
last
either
they
laid
right
down
under
the
water
with
nothing
showing
but
their
our
allies
kept
them
there
every
time
a
hand
showed
one
of
our
friends
made
a
dash
for
it
you
reinforcements
were
to
come
says
mark
all
doubled
up
with
laugh
they
come
and
a
sort
of
reinforcement
i
have
wanted
to
call
on
i
have
known
how
to
use
them
if
wanted
to
friends
like
those
are
hard
to
handle
sometimes
they
quite
detect
the
difference
between
the
folks
you
want
them
to
attack
and
you
in
fact
our
allies
were
the
sort
of
fighters
who
take
a
lot
of
pleasure
in
attacking
anybody
friend
or
foe
they
were
hornets
regular
old
warrior
hornets
it
was
a
nest
of
them
as
big
as
a
bushel
basket
that
mark
had
thrown
down
into
the
boat
it
was
as
bad
as
a
dynamite
bomb
and
more
painful
though
not
quite
so
dangerous
while
our
little
fighters
were
keeping
the
minds
occupied
they
forgot
their
navy
and
it
floated
off
slow
says
mark
and
pointed
i
crazy
about
the
job
picked
out
for
me
not
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
japanese
just
had
all
they
wanted
to
look
i
was
afraid
of
the
hornets
however
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
obey
orders
if
mark
tidd
had
the
nerve
to
use
their
nest
for
a
bomb
i
had
the
nerve
to
go
get
that
boat
so
i
plunged
in
clothes
and
all
and
swam
across
it
any
trick
at
all
to
tow
back
the
and
not
a
hornet
got
me
i
calculate
they
were
all
busy
with
the
japanese
well
i
dragged
the
boat
to
shore
and
we
all
celebrated
it
was
a
great
victory
all
around
mark
said
it
ought
to
be
one
of
the
fifteen
decisive
battles
of
the
world
licked
the
enemy
captured
their
whole
navy
and
to
cap
the
climax
captured
the
little
cane
that
belonged
to
the
man
who
will
come
that
was
a
battle
trophy
worth
having
some
day
going
to
send
it
to
washington
to
be
put
up
in
a
case
in
the
national
war
museum
it
was
an
hour
before
the
broken
and
scattered
forces
of
the
enemy
dared
come
out
of
the
water
and
when
they
did
they
look
as
though
they
would
be
able
to
take
the
offensive
again
for
quite
a
while
to
come
they
were
covered
with
bumps
and
swellings
and
they
limped
and
groaned
and
muttered
mud
on
the
stings
mark
called
to
them
take
the
not
one
of
them
said
a
word
they
just
mogged
along
to
the
hotel
a
pretty
unhappy
lot
you
get
stung
much
i
asked
mark
once
says
he
with
a
grin
ever
did
you
work
it
says
plunk
says
mark
tickled
to
be
getting
some
more
admiration
that
nest
the
other
day
and
sat
down
to
figger
out
how
we
could
use
it
it
hard
to
figger
what
to
do
with
it
but
it
took
more
to
to
do
what
i
wanted
to
but
always
some
now
that
was
just
like
mark
tidd
always
some
way
he
believed
that
it
matter
what
happened
or
what
had
to
be
done
he
knew
there
was
way
to
do
it
and
usually
figure
and
plan
and
calculate
till
he
found
it
got
the
idee
he
went
on
take
the
in
a
pail
and
keep
the
hornets
in
with
a
cover
so
when
i
i
sneaked
up
and
shoved
the
pail
over
the
nest
and
cautious
then
mighty
quick
i
can
you
i
cut
down
the
nest
with
the
cover
and
the
cover
on
the
pail
it
was
as
easy
as
says
i
it
made
it
easy
for
the
well
that
was
the
last
we
saw
of
those
japanese
day
i
guess
the
whole
army
went
into
the
hospital
but
we
feel
like
organizing
any
red
cross
to
help
their
wounded
not
much
chapter
xvi
next
morning
we
saw
a
little
procession
come
out
of
the
hotel
walking
ahead
was
the
man
as
jaunty
as
ever
or
at
least
trying
to
be
a
man
be
very
jaunty
with
a
limp
in
his
left
leg
and
his
eyes
swelled
shut
with
hornet
stings
behind
him
were
three
japanese
carrying
bundles
over
their
shoulders
it
looked
like
they
were
abandoning
the
siege
mark
i
yelled
look
the
he
came
hustling
and
watched
the
japanese
till
they
traveled
out
of
sight
around
the
bend
of
the
road
licked
says
i
says
mark
be
right
i
hope
so
you
what
are
they
away
for
make
you
think
what
you
thought
says
he
he
says
the
fifth
man
would
you
believe
it
but
i
noticed
the
fifth
man
there
that
did
make
it
look
a
bit
fishy
until
i
had
an
idea
he
was
on
guard
across
the
lake
says
i
mark
nodded
so
he
says
i
guess
we
the
drawbridge
for
all
that
if
worth
worth
for
those
have
tried
and
if
any
judge
the
man
who
will
come
a
nest
of
make
anybody
quit
says
i
says
he
just
out
of
he
knows
it
he
knows
we
be
hornet
bombs
at
him
every
do
you
figger
to
do
then
we
on
says
he
with
a
grin
man
has
got
a
scheme
bet
and
be
harder
to
beat
him
when
he
schemes
than
when
he
just
says
i
says
he
get
to
work
our
defenses
plunk
and
binney
keep
a
sharp
watch
you
and
motu
come
told
you
that
the
citadel
was
three
stories
high
the
lower
floor
had
been
an
old
the
second
and
third
floors
had
been
for
the
help
and
storage
there
was
just
one
stairway
leading
up
and
that
was
outside
it
started
from
the
platform
facing
the
hotel
and
went
up
to
the
first
balcony
then
it
took
another
start
from
there
and
went
up
to
the
balcony
of
the
third
floor
there
any
other
way
to
get
up
our
secondary
of
defense
says
mark
when
we
got
to
the
stairs
fix
be
hard
to
climb
the
enemy
should
make
a
on
the
island
well
retreat
to
the
second
there
be
any
stairs
to
climb
up
to
us
to
chop
down
says
he
to
be
done
says
i
nailed
show
you
says
he
there
were
some
old
tools
in
the
and
we
got
them
out
first
we
drew
the
nails
that
held
down
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
next
we
braced
the
stairs
so
they
fall
and
sawed
through
the
at
the
top
mark
fixed
these
just
like
he
had
fixed
the
hinges
when
that
was
all
done
he
drove
staples
in
the
lower
step
fastened
a
rope
to
them
and
led
it
through
another
staple
in
the
roof
the
end
of
the
rope
he
tied
to
a
nail
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
where
it
would
be
handy
try
her
says
i
we
did
and
the
stairs
came
up
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
raised
up
against
the
floor
above
and
leave
a
thing
to
come
up
on
we
lowered
them
again
and
braced
them
with
after
that
we
fixed
the
stairs
between
the
third
and
second
floors
the
same
way
guess
be
pretty
to
get
at
up
here
says
mark
and
i
thought
so
too
the
lances
says
mark
and
i
got
them
and
put
them
handy
at
the
top
of
the
first
stairway
says
he
a
surprise
in
pretty
good
when
we
were
all
through
we
were
pretty
tired
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
under
the
to
rest
mark
had
a
book
and
i
got
out
a
boston
paper
we
had
brought
with
us
it
was
pretty
nearly
a
week
old
but
i
figured
there
might
be
something
interesting
in
it
for
all
that
i
sort
of
browsed
around
in
it
without
finding
anything
to
get
excited
about
till
i
came
to
the
third
or
fourth
page
but
there
was
a
little
piece
about
two
inches
long
that
told
how
the
japanese
minister
to
the
united
states
had
taken
a
summer
place
at
fullington
in
the
state
we
were
in
and
was
planning
to
stay
there
till
the
of
september
it
told
a
little
about
the
house
and
grounds
but
that
so
interesting
says
i
and
i
read
it
to
him
you
got
to
do
with
him
i
whispered
it
so
motu
hear
he
was
a
dozen
feet
off
and
dozing
anyhow
says
mark
this
would
be
as
much
news
to
motu
as
it
is
to
thing
says
i
the
japanese
minister
would
be
in
this
state
and
that
motu
would
be
here
and
that
five
other
japs
would
be
if
there
some
it
says
he
he
turned
and
called
motu
who
opened
his
eyes
quick
and
sprang
up
danger
says
mark
with
a
grin
wanted
to
ask
you
a
course
says
motu
shall
be
glad
to
you
know
says
mark
the
minister
your
country
had
taken
a
summer
home
in
this
state
says
motu
excited
in
a
second
has
says
mark
fullington
wherever
that
is
mark
always
carried
one
of
those
little
pocket
dictionaries
with
maps
of
all
the
states
and
how
to
tell
the
number
of
board
feet
in
a
log
and
how
to
get
a
sliver
out
of
your
finger
and
how
many
folks
live
in
timbuctoo
and
how
many
ounces
in
a
pound
and
the
area
of
greenland
and
wisdom
he
took
it
out
and
found
our
state
and
began
looking
for
fullington
in
a
minute
he
found
it
and
according
to
the
map
it
was
about
half
an
inch
from
our
town
miles
to
the
inch
says
mark
only
about
miles
from
town
says
i
ten
miles
from
town
maybe
in
the
other
says
he
almost
and
almost
north
so
fullington
be
mark
stopped
and
looked
at
motu
motu
was
sitting
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
looking
off
across
the
lake
and
if
i
ever
saw
anybody
thinking
hard
he
was
doing
it
then
we
waited
quite
a
while
but
motu
kept
right
on
thinking
just
as
if
we
there
with
curiosity
oozing
out
of
every
inch
of
us
finally
i
stand
it
any
longer
you
know
he
was
there
i
asked
says
motu
was
great
surprise
to
you
know
him
says
motu
kind
of
hesitated
have
seen
him
in
my
own
country
says
he
i
have
even
spoken
with
minister
to
the
united
states
is
a
pretty
great
man
he
says
i
is
a
great
man
and
a
good
man
and
a
wise
man
says
motu
then
he
says
to
himself
like
he
had
forgotten
about
us
again
miles
only
fifteen
mark
winked
at
me
and
we
got
up
and
went
away
as
quiet
as
we
could
motu
never
noticed
us
go
but
just
looked
out
across
the
lake
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
wonder
if
any
relation
to
the
minister
from
japan
i
says
his
the
was
his
father
motu
would
be
apt
to
know
where
he
lived
says
mark
a
bit
sarcastic
was
a
heap
interested
in
the
news
that
the
minister
was
in
fullington
says
i
make
him
out
he
seem
glad
exactly
says
mark
seem
either
just
bet
that
right
now
whether
the
minister
can
do
him
any
good
and
if
he
can
how
to
get
to
motu
want
him
to
know
he
was
besieged
was
that
says
mark
he
went
on
after
scowled
and
pinched
his
cheek
for
a
couple
of
minutes
think
it
would
be
a
thing
if
the
minister
know
word
was
got
to
him
that
motu
was
here
and
what
was
on
maybe
he
be
a
worth
and
maybe
be
to
give
a
whole
heap
to
says
i
know
and
furthermore
he
likely
to
find
out
very
says
mark
sort
of
solemn
believe
somebody
important
this
just
an
ordinary
scrape
in
somebody
important
in
japan
should
come
to
the
united
states
and
unpleasant
should
to
him
it
would
sort
of
reflect
on
the
united
states
it
to
be
sure
it
would
besides
how
would
in
japan
look
at
it
from
all
i
can
gather
they
love
the
united
states
much
happen
to
a
person
they
honor
would
make
mad
it
to
says
i
likely
the
japanese
nation
would
get
much
excited
over
one
honor
him
much
either
all
right
and
i
like
him
but
i
see
as
any
more
wonderful
than
the
rest
of
us
well
the
whole
united
states
you
and
me
much
are
they
i
rather
guess
not
then
neither
is
japan
a
boy
different
got
emperors
and
princes
and
dukes
and
such
over
there
guess
honor
a
emperor
they
emperor
of
japan
do
you
nor
a
prince
either
nor
yet
a
duke
but
somebody
besides
the
feller
that
peanuts
on
the
corner
you
can
if
he
is
what
are
we
to
do
about
it
i
knew
if
there
was
way
of
it
send
word
to
the
minister
at
fullington
and
him
do
what
he
wanted
to
i
say
to
motu
about
you
that
way
if
right
and
the
japanese
have
gone
then
there
any
need
to
send
if
they
i
much
think
they
they
let
a
messenger
get
says
i
says
he
as
well
get
ready
to
take
advantage
of
that
says
i
the
all
ready
to
send
says
he
he
went
mogging
off
into
the
citadel
where
he
had
some
paper
and
ink
and
stamps
to
write
to
his
folks
with
and
there
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
the
minister
from
japan
it
began
dear
sir
you
interested
in
a
japanese
boy
named
motu
who
owns
a
short
sword
with
things
carved
on
the
blade
of
it
he
is
a
samurai
i
guess
anyhow
he
talks
about
them
he
is
here
in
an
old
hotel
on
lake
ravona
with
four
american
boys
they
are
besieged
by
five
japanese
men
who
want
to
capture
motu
so
far
we
have
beaten
them
the
leader
of
the
enemy
is
a
japanese
man
who
wears
one
round
eyeglass
and
carries
a
cane
and
wears
a
bankok
hat
and
dresses
like
a
dude
he
is
dangerous
all
right
if
you
are
interested
you
had
better
hurry
along
because
things
are
getting
pretty
shaky
i
never
wrote
to
any
japanese
ministers
before
so
i
hope
this
letter
has
not
done
any
harm
yours
truly
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
mark
read
it
over
and
then
says
thought
better
sign
my
whole
when
i
was
writing
to
a
man
like
that
it
better
than
just
mark
looks
longer
anyhow
says
i
we
do
with
the
letter
throw
it
overboard
in
a
bottle
quite
but
put
it
in
an
envelope
with
a
stamp
on
it
and
if
a
comes
either
it
or
mail
says
i
the
chance
comes
pretty
chapter
xvii
says
mark
you
got
the
to
swim
this
lake
in
the
dark
do
it
in
daytime
says
i
be
half
a
mile
across
and
i
could
make
that
like
off
a
log
but
a
different
i
went
out
and
took
a
look
at
the
lake
it
began
to
look
wider
to
me
always
the
way
with
things
if
not
going
to
jump
across
a
hole
the
hole
look
wide
but
just
you
step
up
to
it
ready
to
jump
and
it
seems
to
stretch
out
about
twice
as
big
as
it
was
before
i
could
only
have
some
kind
of
a
mark
to
steer
light
or
that
big
says
mark
pointing
will
up
against
the
sky
and
you
could
head
for
says
i
try
it
but
rather
go
to
an
festival
be
pretty
rub
lard
on
you
says
mark
have
it
in
pie
crust
i
says
for
the
idea
of
being
greased
up
from
top
to
toe
set
well
on
my
stomach
been
things
over
says
mark
it
looks
to
me
like
it
was
our
duty
to
try
to
get
this
letter
sent
to
the
japanese
a
shame
says
i
there
more
swimmers
in
this
crowd
turn
into
a
better
start
about
an
hour
before
says
mark
will
get
you
safe
to
shore
before
daylight
then
strike
for
the
road
and
wait
for
to
come
along
give
the
letter
to
says
i
what
about
back
get
back
as
you
can
to
make
some
kind
of
an
right
says
i
i
want
to
lay
around
a
spell
in
the
sun
and
rest
some
with
you
says
mark
for
be
as
wet
as
i
use
your
head
expect
to
carry
in
your
mouth
did
you
no
well
just
put
in
a
dishpan
and
float
ahead
of
you
then
you
can
rub
yourself
hard
and
get
up
circulation
get
you
warm
in
a
in
my
shoes
too
says
i
over
the
rocks
good
for
bare
we
see
a
japanese
before
i
went
to
bed
which
was
pretty
early
because
i
wanted
to
get
in
a
good
sleep
i
got
it
too
wonder
if
close
to
being
the
prize
sleeper
anyhow
i
come
next
to
mark
but
he
can
wake
up
when
he
wants
to
i
never
wake
up
till
somebody
gets
rough
with
me
mark
did
just
rough
with
three
in
the
morning
and
i
turned
out
in
the
chilliest
morning
air
you
ever
felt
it
seemed
like
it
would
you
as
fast
as
you
got
out
from
under
the
covers
into
it
honest
it
was
just
like
sticking
your
feet
into
to
shove
them
out
of
bed
right
there
i
lost
my
ambition
to
go
swimming
guess
says
i
done
about
all
the
to
the
japanese
minister
that
i
need
to
i
owe
him
any
chilly
says
mark
and
he
grinned
and
sort
of
wriggled
all
over
like
he
enjoyed
something
wish
it
was
you
says
i
you
giggle
so
be
warmer
the
air
says
he
could
do
that
and
still
freeze
you
to
death
i
says
as
cross
as
two
sticks
gim
me
the
i
wrapped
a
blanket
around
me
to
keep
me
alive
till
i
got
to
the
water
mark
had
the
dishpan
all
ready
with
the
towels
and
my
shoes
tied
into
it
and
the
letter
under
them
says
he
off
the
end
of
the
island
and
in
cautious
likely
watched
every
i
went
off
alone
into
the
dark
and
for
once
i
wished
never
seen
mark
tidd
i
wished
he
moved
to
wicksville
and
i
wished
he
fat
and
i
wished
he
stutter
i
just
wished
he
at
all
but
when
i
got
into
the
water
i
felt
better
it
was
surprising
how
warm
and
comfortable
the
water
was
after
the
air
i
swam
easy
and
slow
till
i
could
get
my
bearings
it
was
pretty
dark
but
not
so
dark
but
what
i
could
see
the
black
shape
of
the
old
hemlock
against
the
sky
when
i
had
it
located
i
laid
low
and
steered
for
it
it
was
a
good
long
swim
but
i
had
swum
distances
enough
to
know
better
than
to
tire
myself
out
at
the
start
i
just
mogged
along
stopping
to
float
every
once
in
a
while
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
across
it
been
anything
the
worst
part
was
the
lonesomeness
of
it
and
the
thought
that
came
a
couple
of
times
what
would
i
do
if
i
got
cramps
ugh
but
i
i
made
then
had
to
get
out
into
that
air
again
wow
cold
it
was
as
cold
as
greenland
multiplied
by
iceland
with
bay
thrown
in
to
fill
the
basket
you
better
guess
that
i
grabbed
those
towels
and
began
to
rub
myself
i
rubbed
and
scrubbed
till
the
skin
was
ready
to
come
off
like
the
peel
of
an
orange
but
it
did
warm
me
just
like
mark
said
it
would
after
i
was
tired
rubbing
i
picked
out
an
open
space
and
capered
up
and
down
in
it
i
expect
i
looked
like
a
luny
there
in
the
woods
without
anything
on
but
a
towel
tied
around
the
middle
of
me
and
me
doing
some
sort
of
wild
injun
dance
all
by
myself
i
almost
had
to
laugh
pretty
soon
it
began
to
grow
light
and
i
made
for
the
road
going
pretty
careful
there
was
no
telling
where
those
japanese
might
be
it
was
lucky
i
did
go
careful
too
for
i
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
i
smelled
smoke
and
in
a
minute
saw
the
glow
of
a
fire
right
there
i
stopped
navigation
when
i
went
ahead
again
it
was
at
quarter
speed
with
my
hand
on
the
throttle
heard
about
injuns
and
how
still
they
can
go
through
the
woods
well
that
morning
i
beat
any
injun
cooper
ever
read
about
i
made
so
little
noise
that
the
woods
were
stiller
than
if
i
been
there
at
all
the
fire
was
down
in
a
little
hollow
i
skirted
around
it
but
near
enough
so
i
could
see
who
was
camping
there
it
was
two
japanese
one
asleep
the
other
watching
i
laughed
inside
he
doing
as
good
a
job
of
watching
as
he
thought
he
was
i
could
have
plunked
him
with
my
slingshot
and
i
had
half
a
mind
to
do
it
but
common
sense
came
along
just
then
and
i
made
tracks
away
one
thing
was
sure
the
japanese
left
us
they
were
trying
to
bamboozle
us
into
getting
careless
just
as
mark
had
said
it
got
lighter
and
lighter
as
i
went
along
and
after
a
while
i
came
to
the
road
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
find
a
sheltered
place
where
i
could
keep
out
of
the
breeze
watch
the
road
and
be
out
of
sight
then
i
started
in
to
wait
waiting
is
the
meanest
job
in
the
world
rather
do
anything
else
than
wait
you
keep
thinking
every
minute
that
what
waiting
for
will
be
along
and
then
when
it
come
you
get
impatient
and
then
you
get
irritable
and
then
you
get
mad
and
after
a
long
while
you
just
sit
there
and
chaw
your
knuckles
and
wish
there
was
somebody
to
kick
got
to
the
kicking
stage
when
i
heard
something
coming
from
away
from
town
a
man
was
talking
yuh
stop
he
says
on
jest
shove
one
foot
ahead
and
then
foller
it
with
another
if
yuh
stop
agin
i
to
most
take
the
hide
offn
you
whup
wiggle
your
ears
if
you
want
to
in
a
minute
along
came
a
mule
with
ears
about
a
foot
long
he
was
a
mule
with
a
sort
of
twinkle
in
his
eye
he
was
dragging
a
thing
the
like
of
which
never
seen
before
and
in
it
was
the
man
you
ever
saw
he
a
big
man
nor
a
little
man
he
was
just
an
man
not
only
in
size
but
i
guess
in
everything
else
he
was
shabby
and
his
hat
was
battered
and
he
shaved
for
about
two
weeks
my
but
he
looked
mournful
all
the
time
he
kept
talking
to
his
mule
begging
him
to
keep
on
going
and
not
to
stop
till
i
stepped
out
in
the
road
and
said
good
morning
the
mule
stopped
and
spread
all
four
legs
like
he
willing
to
be
pushed
in
any
direction
he
looked
like
something
that
somebody
had
braced
up
so
the
wind
blow
it
down
says
the
man
making
a
question
of
it
look
what
up
and
done
stopped
my
automobeel
dumbdest
enjine
in
this
here
automobeel

and
much
says
he
if

in
a
i
went
off
and
left
him
pulling
and
hauling
at
the
ears
trying
to
get
him
to
start
for
fifteen
minutes
i
could
hear
him
arguing
with
the
critter
and
then
i
passed
out
of
sight
been
gone
from
the
island
and
the
citadel
about
four
hours
and
a
half
i
figured
chapter
xviii
i
started
to
swim
back
pushing
my
dishpan
ahead
of
me
the
sun
began
to
warm
things
up
and
it
was
a
lot
more
comfortable
than
it
had
been
on
my
first
trip
across
i
just
poked
along
enjoying
myself
and
hoping
breakfast
would
be
kept
warm
for
me
that
was
as
near
as
i
came
to
having
breakfast
for
quite
some
time
when
i
got
back
to
the
citadel
i
had
something
to
think
about
besides
eating
in
fact
i
had
before
i
got
to
the
citadel
i
was
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
citadel
and
going
easy
when
i
heard
a
splashing
off
to
one
side
i
raised
up
and
there
not
two
hundred
feet
away
was
a
raft
with
two
japanese
on
it
they
seen
me
but
were
making
for
the
citadel
as
fast
as
they
could
go
i
got
as
low
in
the
water
as
was
possible
to
anything
but
a
fish
and
put
on
full
steam
it
was
lucky
they
had
such
a
clumsy
raft
and
such
rotten
paddles
or
i
have
made
as
good
time
as
they
did
but
i
managed
to
keep
ahead
and
gain
a
little
when
i
got
close
to
shore
i
raised
my
head
and
let
out
a
bellow
tidd
hey
look
out
i
seen
anybody
around
the
citadel
and
thought
maybe
the
japanese
were
going
to
take
them
by
i
was
right
as
i
found
out
later
plunk
had
been
on
watch
and
because
he
was
all
tired
out
he
had
gone
to
sleep
for
a
few
minutes
my
yell
woke
him
up
and
the
rest
of
them
too
after
that
things
moved
fast
i
got
to
shore
and
made
a
dash
for
some
clothes
i
wanted
more
on
than
a
towel
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight
pants
and
a
shirt
exactly
armor
but
fighting
with
nothing
on
at
all
does
make
you
feel
sort
of
i
ducked
up
the
stairs
and
as
i
went
i
happened
to
look
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
there
came
wallowing
another
raft
with
two
japanese
on
it
we
were
being
attacked
from
two
sides
i
gave
another
yell
mark
came
rushing
out
and
saw
what
was
going
on
into
your
clothes
quick
says
he
and
i
did
when
i
came
out
both
rafts
were
near
the
shore
and
mark
and
plunk
and
binney
were
shooting
at
them
with
their
slingshots
but
their
attention
was
divided
i
joined
in
with
plunk
but
in
a
jiffy
we
saw
a
third
raft
coming
for
the
end
of
our
island
with
the
man
who
will
come
on
it
three
sides
to
defend
mark
i
yelled
comes
another
he
just
took
one
look
for
the
citadel
says
he
quick
and
the
stairs
after
my
but
he
was
excited
and
the
way
he
stuttered
sounded
like
hail
falling
on
a
tin
roof
we
lose
a
minute
but
made
for
the
stairs
and
hauled
them
up
when
we
were
safe
on
the
second
floor
plunk
says
this
for
now
they
can
land
all
they
want
says
mark
had
a
chance
to
keep
them
off
three
parties
of
we
might
have
kept
off
one
or
two
but
some
of
would
have
been
sure
to
and
we
have
been
it
was
good
strategy
they
forced
us
to
it
would
have
been
rotten
strategy
for
us
to
have
stood
and
fought
as
it
is
we
drew
off
our
army
without
and
occupied
a
strong
defensive
position
if
stayed
we
might
have
lost
an
army
corps
or
we
had
one
of
them
aeroplanes
says
plunk
says
i
we
got
balloons
nor
submarines
we
got
even
a
got
a
chance
says
mark
driven
off
the
roof
make
the
enemy
take
this
floor
and
then
to
the
next
and
then
by
jimminy
take
to
the
roof
i
want
to
hear
any
more
talk
about
no
chance
got
all
the
chance
we
all
this
time
we
were
keeping
our
eyes
on
the
japanese
who
had
landed
and
seemed
sort
of
surprised
they
did
it
so
easy
they
came
because
i
guess
made
them
think
a
bit
in
the
last
fight
and
they
want
to
walk
into
a
trap
they
gathered
off
among
the
and
had
a
council
of
war
then
they
came
toward
the
citadel
in
a
body
with
the
man
walking
ahead
he
was
considerable
improved
but
it
would
be
several
days
before
be
fit
to
go
to
a
party
his
was
there
and
his
dude
clothes
but
we
had
his
cane
somehow
he
look
natural
without
it
it
seemed
like
that
cane
was
a
part
of
him
like
it
had
grown
on
him
they
came
up
close
and
then
mark
gave
the
word
to
fire
we
let
them
have
several
good
licks
with
our
slingshots
and
they
backed
off
for
another
talk
next
time
they
came
on
the
run
and
before
we
could
pelt
them
enough
to
do
any
good
they
were
under
the
gallery
where
we
hit
them
but
we
could
hear
them
moving
around
and
by
laying
down
on
our
stomachs
we
could
see
them
through
cracks
between
the
boards
first
they
went
inside
looking
for
a
stairway
but
of
course
they
find
any
we
were
just
out
of
stairways
and
expect
to
get
any
more
for
quite
a
while
we
held
a
council
of
war
ourselves
just
ways
they
can
get
up
says
mark
is
to
get
the
stairs
lowered
one
is
to
climb
up
over
the
front
balcony
with
and
the
last
is
to
get
into
a
window
on
the
west
side
with
a
ladder
they
attack
the
back
the
water
keeps
off
i
was
to
attack
says
i
send
three
men
and
maybe
four
to
come
up
ladders
to
the
front
balcony
while
they
were
around
there
attention
have
one
man
sneak
up
into
one
of
those
west
windows
and
come
creeping
across
behind
us
to
cut
down
the
for
you
tallow
says
mark
would
you
guard
against
it
says
i
after
scratching
my
head
a
minute
guess
fasten
the
windows
so
nobody
could
get
class
says
mark
if
we
could
only
think
of
some
way
to
says
i
got
fasteners
says
he
how
about
the
glass
they
could
it
and
reach
in
to
unlock
that
was
a
fact
we
nail
them
because
we
have
any
nails
and
anyhow
it
have
done
much
good
for
a
man
who
had
his
mind
set
on
it
could
have
smashed
through
anyhow
but
one
way
says
mark
keep
the
japanese
out
of
those
windows
and
to
all
the
time
got
to
keep
track
of
japanese
got
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
windows
got
to
watch
the
and
the
rest
of
us
have
got
to
be
ready
for
an
attack
here
in
says
i
your
read
of
says
mark
heard
tell
of
but
right
now
more
curious
about
says
he
as
well
get
as
much
pleasure
out
of
this
as
possible
you
can
get
out
of
on
a
tack
if
you
go
at
it
right
pretend
in
a
stone
castle
up
on
a
shelf
on
a
the
only
way
to
attack
us
is
to
scale
the
cliff
with
ladders
a
tribe
of
the
enemy
has
come
down
on
to
heard
says
plunk
ate
says
mark
with
a
grin
pretend
that
far
dog
look
like
cut
up
into
good
satisfies
me
says
binney
we
are
and
if
my
ears
gone
to
those
enemies
are
ready
to
stir
up
says
mark
binney
get
to
the
west
cliff
where
the
leetle
cave
are
plunk
you
watch
the
ladder
hauled
up
motu
and
tallow
and
i
will
off
the
main
attack
if
it
it
came
all
right
there
any
pretending
about
that
one
japanese
scooted
out
and
cut
the
rope
that
held
the
drawbridge
and
down
she
dropped
then
two
more
put
their
heads
down
low
so
we
get
a
good
pelt
at
them
and
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
across
to
the
hotel
they
were
gone
about
three
minutes
when
we
saw
them
coming
back
with
a
two
ladders
one
was
a
long
ladder
the
other
was
short
we
made
it
as
pleasant
and
sociable
for
them
as
possible
but
they
dashed
under
cover
in
spite
of
all
we
could
do
ready
says
mark
then
he
raised
his
voice
and
yelled
to
plunk
and
binney
your
eyes
open
i
leaned
over
the
railing
and
out
came
three
japanese
with
the
ladders
and
what
do
you
think
they
had
on
to
protect
them
from
shots
from
above
bushel
baskets
yes
sir
every
one
of
them
had
a
basket
on
his
head
they
looked
like
some
newfangled
kind
of
says
i
to
mark
he
looked
and
shook
his
head
and
grinned
sort
of
admiring
knew
that
man
who
will
come
was
a
one
says
he
have
invented
armor
slingshots
any
good
hit
their
fingers
says
i
of
time
says
he
are
the
thing
let
their
ladders
against
the
cliff
as
soon
as
a
man
gets
near
with
a
give
it
a
shove
and
topple
it
he
stopped
a
minute
see
of
the
man
or
the
other
jap
do
you
says
i
says
he
have
to
trust
to
the
the
men
were
raising
their
ladders
the
shorter
one
got
in
reach
first
and
mark
gave
it
a
shove
that
sent
it
and
the
man
who
had
it
over
on
to
the
ground
with
a
good
sound
flop
that
stop
the
two
with
the
big
ladder
they
used
different
tactics
off
they
got
a
ways
and
then
pointed
the
ladder
at
the
railing
like
a
and
came
on
with
a
run
we
had
as
much
chance
of
stopping
it
as
a
hippopotamus
has
of
climbing
a
bang
went
the
ladder
against
the
railing
and
as
soon
as
it
struck
the
men
jumped
on
it
to
hold
it
down
we
pushed
and
pried
but
it
only
wabbled
it
was
too
heavy
for
us
says
mark
that
was
a
real
idea
we
both
got
on
one
side
and
pushed
the
ladder
moved
a
foot
by
now
the
first
man
was
up
hard
says
mark
all
three
of
us
put
our
weight
against
it
and
it
started
slow
at
first
but
gradually
getting
faster
until
it
went
with
a
swoop
the
top
man
jumped
all
sprawled
out
and
rolled
over
a
couple
of
times
when
he
struck
says
i
mark
grinned
and
so
did
motu
says
motu
will
stop
them
for
one
moment
it
is
like
the
sieges
of
ancient
strongholds
in
stories
of
my
they
got
up
their
ladders
and
tried
again
but
now
we
had
the
trick
of
it
and
put
them
over
easy
wish
says
mark
knew
what
the
man
is
says
i
him
says
mark
got
a
scheme
this
attack
in
expected
to
win
know
better
to
cover
up
says
i
we
can
do
is
wait
and
to
matters
as
they
so
sure
says
mark
stay
here
i
want
to
go
back
by
the
he
went
motu
and
i
watched
the
japanese
drag
the
ladders
under
the
porch
and
listened
to
them
jabber
motu
understood
what
they
were
saying
and
grinned
at
me
friendly
and
sort
of
proud
say
be
great
warriors
some
also
they
are
saying
have
been
told
americans
can
not
fight
and
do
not
want
to
fight
we
have
been
told
japan
with
a
little
army
could
win
from
america
with
big
army
but
if
the
men
fight
like
the
boys
it
is
not
that
is
good
to
hear
tallow
i
wish
all
japanese
could
hear
it
i
wish
it
because
all
good
men
who
a
great
friendship
for
the
united
states
we
do
not
like
talk
of
war
we
like
to
think
only
of
peace
forever
but
some
there
are
who
have
hot
as
you
have
hotheads
in
america
they
see
insults
where
there
are
no
insults
they
blame
all
america
for
what
one
part
of
america
does
it
hurts
japanese
pride
to
be
treated
as
we
are
by
california
has
reasons
thinking
men
know
that
so
i
wish
all
hotheads
might
know
how
great
america
is
and
what
she
motu
stopped
a
moment
and
raised
his
head
in
a
dignified
kind
of
way
says
he
japan
fears
good
warriors
and
would
make
war
only
on
the
weak
russia
was
not
weak
but
those
who
talk
war
most
go
to
war
least
a
little
fear
would
make
them
cautious
so
i
wish
all
could
know
the
warrior
spirit
that
sleeps
in
america
that
they
might
never
awake
too
says
i
all
japanese
were
like
you
motu
i
guess
there
be
any
row
at
motu
smiled
all
have
the
advantage
to
see
america
and
england
and
the
world
that
i
have
they
live
at
home
and
their
vision
is
narrow
they
can
not
understand
but
some
day
i
shall
teach
he
caught
himself
suddenly
and
looked
at
me
then
he
went
on
as
if
he
would
make
me
think
he
had
said
what
he
exactly
mean
day
i
will
do
all
a
common
boy
can
do
to
make
them
know
i
will
tell
many
says
i
but
i
fooled
right
there
i
was
convinced
that
motu
was
pretty
important
and
powerful
at
home
in
japan
you
could
tell
it
by
the
way
he
spoke
when
he
thinking
all
of
a
sudden
plunk
let
out
a
yell
says
he
away
from
there
git
lam
you
good
he
says
motu
and
i
ran
around
the
corner
and
saw
plunk
poking
his
lance
at
somebody
through
the
stairway
just
then
mark
tidd
came
out
of
the
door
rolling
a
big
barrel
that
found
he
frowned
at
us
is
in
front
says
he
back
there
he
was
right
about
it
we
had
left
our
station
unguarded
the
matter
i
yelled
at
plunk
to
cut
the
rope
that
holds
up
the
stairs
says
he
away
his
knife
got
it
tied
to
a
motu
and
i
hurried
around
in
front
and
got
there
just
in
time
for
two
japanese
were
trying
to
sneak
up
a
ladder
quiet
without
hearing
from
then
on
we
have
time
to
bother
about
plunk
and
his
troubles
chapter
xix
motu
and
i
soon
disposed
of
the
two
japanese
and
their
ladder
as
soon
as
they
had
picked
themselves
up
we
heard
the
man
who
will
come
calling
to
them
motu
said
he
was
telling
them
to
quit
monkeying
around
there
and
come
to
help
him
will
watch
here
says
motu
go
to
help
mark
i
was
willing
enough
because
i
wanted
to
see
what
was
going
on
so
i
ran
around
the
corner
just
in
time
to
see
mark
leaning
as
far
over
as
the
size
of
him
would
allow
and
smearing
something
on
the
stairs
where
they
were
hauled
up
you
i
asked
them
says
he
without
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
smile
was
for
so
it
into
it
was
in
this
he
pointed
to
the
big
barrel
seen
him
rolling
out
i
went
over
and
looked
in
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
was
about
a
pailful
of
some
soap
or
something
like
that
the
idee
i
asked
him
the
stairs
easy
to
walk
up
says
he
i
quite
understand
but
it
very
many
hours
before
i
understood
good
and
it
was
one
of
the
slickest
sights
mark
tidd
ever
arranged
mark
went
right
on
daubing
the
messy
stuff
on
the
stairs
as
thick
as
he
could
get
it
while
plunk
kept
poking
away
at
the
knife
a
japanese
was
trying
to
cut
the
rope
with
wish
that
rope
was
wire
says
i
be
so
easy
to
mark
straightened
up
and
looked
at
me
says
he
idee
was
worth
your
board
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
a
coil
of
up
in
there
get
i
found
it
hanging
on
a
nail
and
brought
it
along
by
that
time
mark
was
done
daubing
and
he
took
the
wire
and
rigged
it
alongside
the
rope
to
the
stairs
that
led
up
to
the
third
floor
use
the
to
haul
up
the
stairs
says
he
it
gets
so
we
have
to
up
then
with
the
wire
tallow
proud
of
you
promoted
for
this
wire
idee
i
dub
thee
knight
git
down
on
your
had
knights
says
i
the
kind
that
does
says
he
i
grinned
sort
of
foolish
i
expect
and
got
down
he
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
with
the
stick
he
had
been
using
and
says
sir
tallow
martin
i
dub
thee
with
that
he
put
a
smear
of
the
messy
stuff
on
my
cheek
and
chuckled
daub
the
knight
too
says
he
make
it
all
the
was
plenty
powerful
enough
without
says
i
all
of
a
sudden
the
stairs
dropped
with
a
bang
plunk
had
missed
the
knife
with
his
lance
and
the
japanese
had
cut
the
rope
to
repel
attack
mark
shouted
and
grabbed
his
lance
plunk
had
his
and
so
did
i
mark
and
i
stood
plumb
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
while
plunk
stood
over
to
the
side
to
take
the
enemy
on
the
flank
no
sooner
did
the
stairs
drop
than
three
japanese
made
a
wild
jump
on
to
them
one
man
was
ahead
and
made
a
bound
up
three
steps
the
others
were
right
on
his
heels
well
sir
what
followed
was
too
good
to
be
true
the
top
man
no
sooner
landed
on
the
step
than
both
his
feet
went
out
from
under
him
and
he
sprawled
on
his
face
his
heels
flew
back
and
swatted
the
two
behind
and
went
down
and
all
of
them
rolled
over
and
over
to
the
floor
in
a
tangle
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
their
faces
and
you
never
saw
anybody
look
so
surprised
and
startled
and
mad
all
at
once
the
first
fellow
says
when
he
landed
and
says
the
other
two
fellows
when
his
heels
hit
them
in
the
stummicks
i
guess
it
knocked
the
wind
clean
out
of
them
for
they
all
sat
on
the
floor
gasping
and
hanging
on
to
their
like
they
thought
somebody
was
going
to
try
to
steal
them
they
get
right
up
you
could
see
they
ready
to
stand
up
not
any
of
them
they
were
perfectly
willing
to
rest
a
bit
in
a
minute
the
man
came
in
sight
and
began
jabbering
at
them
at
first
they
do
anything
but
goggle
at
him
and
groan
and
pant
but
he
them
till
they
got
on
to
their
feet
pretty
slow
and
painful
the
man
pointed
at
the
stairs
and
says
something
in
a
commanding
voice
the
three
started
at
us
again
but
there
any
rush
about
it
they
had
their
plateful
of
rushing
on
those
stairs
no
sir
they
hurry
a
bit
have
thought
maybe
they
were
climbing
up
to
have
a
tooth
pulled
hanging
on
to
the
rail
and
stepping
soft
and
easy
even
at
that
the
stairs
were
so
slippery
they
could
hardly
hold
their
feet
we
stood
at
the
top
and
laughed
at
them
that
was
about
all
we
could
do
we
laughed
but
that
mean
we
were
easy
in
our
should
say
not
those
fellows
looked
i
felt
as
if
somebody
was
waving
his
hand
up
and
down
inside
my
stummick
and
my
legs
were
trembly
and
i
wished
i
was
back
in
michigan
with
lots
of
room
to
run
feel
says
i
to
mark
says
he
and
grinned
that
was
the
very
word
for
it
there
was
company
enough
too
much
of
it
if
you
come
to
that
but
i
was
never
so
lonesome
before
and
i
expect
ever
to
be
so
lonesome
again
the
first
man
hanging
on
to
the
rail
with
one
hand
was
near
enough
now
so
plunk
could
swipe
at
him
with
his
lance
the
lance
you
remember
was
a
long
stick
with
a
wad
on
the
end
bigger
than
a
it
hurt
anybody
much
to
get
a
wallop
with
it
but
it
would
bother
them
considerable
it
bothered
the
japanese
for
plunk
drew
back
and
gave
him
a
good
one
right
alongside
the
ear
the
man
grunted
and
threw
up
his
arm
plunk
banged
him
again
and
he
sort
of
wabbled
him
quick
while
off
his
yelled
mark
and
plunk
did
the
jap
did
a
funny
little
dance
on
his
toes
grabbed
for
the
rail
and
missed
it
whirled
around
with
his
arms
waggling
and
sat
down
then
he
coasted
right
against
the
legs
of
the
other
two
and
pushed
their
feet
off
the
steps
so
they
plumped
down
right
on
top
of
him
like
he
was
a
sled
and
coasted
all
the
way
down
on
him
bet
he
enjoyed
it
slide
mark
says
they
have
in
japan
they
act
like
they
understand
very
thought
says
i
they
made
a
pretty
good
slide
for
graceful
says
plunk
like
to
see
folks
slide
pretty
and
neat
these
fellers
is
clumsy
as
the
three
picked
themselves
up
after
felt
of
their
shins
and
rubbed
their
ribs
and
grunted
considerable
the
man
dapper
as
ever
with
his
glass
in
his
eye
stood
scowling
at
them
he
never
looked
up
at
us
once
for
a
while
he
say
anything
then
he
spoke
in
japanese
and
they
all
went
away
says
i
mark
grunted
yet
the
got
a
scheme
just
we
have
to
wait
long
for
in
three
minutes
they
were
back
each
one
of
them
carrying
a
sand
they
to
do
with
that
says
plunk
it
in
our
eyes
do
you
stop
an
engine
on
a
slippery
track
mark
asked
sand
in
front
of
the
drivers
says
plunk
says
he
these
japanese
was
engines
and
the
stairs
was
a
what
then
it
was
plain
enough
now
the
man
had
found
a
way
to
get
ahead
of
greasy
scheme
they
began
putting
sand
on
the
stairs
thick
first
they
covered
the
bottom
step
and
then
worked
up
a
step
at
a
time
fixing
each
one
so
they
had
a
firm
footing
of
course
they
get
to
the
four
or
five
top
steps
because
we
were
there
to
see
they
but
they
did
the
best
they
could
then
they
stood
out
of
reach
and
tossed
up
sand
so
it
fell
on
the
steps
that
were
still
greasy
they
kept
it
up
till
every
step
was
covered
and
then
they
made
another
attack
it
was
lucky
the
stairs
were
narrow
so
only
one
man
could
come
at
us
at
a
time
but
that
stop
them
they
came
like
they
meant
business
the
first
man
crouched
and
jumped
mark
poked
him
while
he
was
in
the
air
and
he
stumbled
and
went
down
on
his
knees
but
there
he
stuck
there
any
more
coasting
on
account
of
the
sand
he
got
up
again
and
stood
with
his
hands
like
a
boxer
ready
to
grab
the
first
lance
that
was
shoved
at
him
on
he
came
mark
feinted
for
his
face
and
when
he
threw
up
his
hands
changed
his
aim
of
a
sudden
and
lammed
him
in
the
stummick
at
the
same
time
plunk
let
him
have
one
in
the
ear
and
i
reached
through
and
gave
his
ankle
a
shove
it
upset
him
again
the
others
caught
him
and
shoved
him
ahead
i
guess
they
figured
on
using
him
as
a
shield
but
he
appear
to
like
that
idea
much
for
he
wiggled
and
squirmed
and
yelled
we
were
sorry
for
course
we
business
was
business
and
we
gave
it
to
him
good
thud
thud
thud
went
the
padded
ends
of
our
lances
against
his
ribs
and
his
head
and
wherever
we
could
reach
it
any
use
the
stairs
were
narrow
and
steep
and
they
get
a
firm
footing
in
spite
of
their
sand
and
we
forced
them
back
a
step
at
a
time
until
mark
and
i
were
standing
down
the
stairs
we
go
any
farther
but
there
we
stood
and
beat
them
back
as
fast
as
they
came
on
illustration
there
we
stood
and
beat
them
back
as
fast
as
they
came
on
then
what
did
the
man
do
but
get
an
and
put
his
men
on
it
they
came
at
us
like
a
and
better
believe
we
had
to
scatter
up
the
stairs
they
charged
but
when
their
ram
was
past
the
head
of
the
flight
we
were
ready
for
them
again
the
farther
they
came
the
farther
past
us
their
ram
we
could
get
in
range
with
our
lances
it
was
hot
work
and
hard
work
but
we
forced
them
back
once
more
and
managed
to
grab
their
when
they
dropped
it
it
was
our
second
trophy
of
the
war
first
the
little
cane
and
now
the
we
treated
ourselves
to
a
cheer
though
we
have
a
great
supply
of
wind
to
cheer
with
now
came
a
lull
in
the
attack
i
guess
the
enemy
had
run
out
of
ambition
or
maybe
the
man
was
fussing
around
to
get
some
new
idea
he
had
done
pretty
well
so
far
with
his
ideas
and
taking
the
whole
campaign
into
consideration
we
had
a
little
the
worst
of
it
for
we
had
lost
the
bridge
and
the
island
and
were
besieged
in
the
citadel
but
that
mean
we
were
licked
the
hardest
fights
in
a
siege
come
when
the
citadel
itself
has
to
be
taken
and
the
japanese
were
finding
that
out
we
used
all
our
resources
either
for
binney
and
motu
were
keeping
guard
and
the
dog
was
tied
up
to
be
sure
he
would
be
out
of
the
way
mark
sort
of
figured
the
dog
might
come
in
handy
sometime
but
he
want
to
use
him
if
he
have
to
because
the
japanese
care
whether
they
hurt
the
dog
or
not
and
they
would
be
a
little
mite
careful
what
they
did
to
us
we
afraid
of
what
would
happen
to
us
anyhow
the
worst
would
be
a
little
rough
handling
what
we
were
worried
about
was
their
capturing
motu
the
japanese
had
disappeared
from
the
foot
of
the
stairway
and
mark
went
to
warn
the
guards
to
keep
their
eyes
wide
open
then
he
came
back
and
we
sat
down
to
wait
developments
below
somewhere
we
heard
the
noise
of
hammering
and
mark
says
bet
where
we
this
stairway
if
the
of
the
same
scheme
i
am
he
can
us
then
says
i
sort
of
startled
says
he
make
for
the
floor
they
cut
down
the
stairs
there
and
they
reach
us
with
ladders
our
strongest
up
there
ounce
of
it
says
mark
not
sneak
up
there
then
says
i
says
he
want
to
take
up
every
of
time
we
can
every
hour
we
save
is
in
our
here
been
half
a
to
take
this
stairway
that
i
he
took
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
then
he
wrinkled
up
his
face
and
felt
of
his
stomach
i
felt
sort
of
funny
says
he
what
it
is
says
i
says
he
you
can
believe
now
that
we
had
been
having
a
pretty
busy
and
exciting
time
the
best
proof
of
it
that
i
could
give
you
was
just
mark
tidd
forgot
it
was
dinnertime
he
had
gone
three
hours
past
mealtime
and
never
noticed
it
to
eat
says
he
or
no
down
enough
for
the
crowd
says
i
he
waddled
and
in
ten
minutes
came
back
with
two
ham
sandwiches
for
each
of
us
we
had
a
whole
boiled
ham
and
enough
bread
to
run
us
they
were
good
generous
sandwiches
with
a
slice
of
ham
in
them
that
you
could
taste
when
you
bit
and
mustard
when
mark
tidd
fixed
something
to
eat
he
fixed
it
so
nobody
in
the
world
could
complain
and
so
he
complain
himself
there
was
as
much
difference
between
these
sandwiches
of
his
and
the
kind
you
buy
as
there
is
between
getting
hit
with
a
hammer
and
getting
hit
with
a
feather
when
the
five
of
us
got
through
there
a
crum
left
that
would
pay
for
a
time
picking
it
up
mark
forget
the
dog
either
but
gave
him
a
bone
i
had
a
drink
says
i
mark
looked
at
me
and
then
at
plunk
says
he
there
none
says
plunk
a
drop
says
mark
all
says
i
sort
of
significant
on
and
hum
says
mark
my
fault
all
right
but
i
guess
it
the
right
below
when
we
get
thirsty
we
can
go
to
look
at
it
i
suppose
i
says
as
sarcastic
as
i
could
get
thirsty
says
mark
you
some
way
to
get
water
near
can
let
down
a
bucket
with
a
rope
i
says
for
that
idea
just
popped
into
my
head
i
should
have
thought
of
it
before
ahead
says
mark
i
went
to
get
a
bucket
but
not
a
bucket
could
i
find
i
hunted
high
and
low
and
crossways
and
sideways
but
not
a
sign
of
a
bucket
was
there
not
a
bucket
nor
a
pail
nor
anything
that
i
could
see
that
would
hold
water
i
went
back
and
told
mark
so
says
he
could
have
told
you
and
if
a
bucket
there
have
been
any
long
can
a
man
live
without
water
says
i
getting
thirsty
all
at
once
camel
can
live
eight
says
he
as
sober
as
a
judge
a
camel
says
i
getting
pretty
mad
at
the
cool
way
he
took
it
have
to
stand
it
as
long
as
we
can
says
mark
was
a
bad
blunder
worst
i
ever
made
i
guess
but
says
he
his
little
eyes
sort
of
glinting
be
so
dry
the
blow
me
away
before
i
say
says
i
still
good
and
mad
the
human
body
is
water
if
so
enough
water
mixed
up
with
you
to
quench
the
thirst
of
general
for
once
he
say
anything
back
but
he
stored
that
up
in
his
mind
better
believe
with
the
idea
of
getting
even
with
me
when
the
chance
came
but
that
worry
me
it
was
enough
worry
to
think
about
being
shut
up
for
days
without
anything
to
drink
i
sat
down
on
the
railing
and
looked
out
over
the
lake
just
thinking
of
things
general
like
i
must
have
got
interested
in
what
i
was
thinking
about
for
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
heard
a
voice
over
past
the
hotel
yelling
you
tell
when
i
got
the
brake
on
eh
say
what
kind
of
a
be
you
anyhow
throwed
out
the
clutch
and
slammed
on
the
brake
but
you
pay
no
more
than
as
if
i
done
at
all
whoa
there
it
was
my
friend
that
met
on
the
road
and
got
to
deliver
the
message
what
he
was
doing
here
i
for
the
life
of
me
guess
but
i
figured
come
out
of
curiosity
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
i
called
mark
and
the
boys
the
old
fellow
managed
to
stop
his
and
sat
staring
over
at
us
i
waved
my
hand
and
yelled
at
then
the
man
and
his
followers
just
across
the
bridge
and
went
for
the
old
fellow
he
saw
them
coming
and
began
to
jerk
and
slap
his
lines
you
he
yelled
i
pressed
the
button
eh
then
why
you
start
the
lever
in
low
git
a
stir
on
to
you
but
the
animal
never
stirred
the
old
fellow
stood
up
and
larruped
him
with
the
lines
but
he
just
sort
of
humped
his
back
and
laid
down
his
ears
and
took
root
then
the
man
and
his
folks
got
there
one
of
them
set
out
to
grab
the
mule
the
mule
turned
and
looked
him
right
in
the
face
and
then
something
happened
you
never
saw
an
engine
explode
bet
you
neither
did
i
but
the
nearest
i
can
imagine
to
what
that
mule
did
he
just
naturally
up
and
exploded
first
he
opened
his
mouth
and
let
out
a
holler
that
was
enough
to
raise
the
dead
and
then
he
lashed
out
with
all
four
feet
and
his
tail
and
tried
to
bite
with
his
teeth
you
can
bet
those
japanese
backed
off
a
little
the
old
fellow
seem
to
mind
a
bit
he
just
spread
his
legs
so
the
mule
could
kick
free
and
waited
all
at
once
the
mule
quit
kicking
and
started
off
straight
ahead
in
high
yelled
the
old
fellow
this
time
i
guess
the
mule
knew
right
where
the
lever
was
for
the
way
he
got
out
of
there
was
a
caution
if
he
doing
forty
miles
an
hour
then
i
want
a
cent
the
japanese
tried
to
stop
him
but
he
nipped
one
on
the
arm
and
came
pretty
close
to
running
right
over
the
top
of
another
whee
but
they
scattered
the
old
fellow
turned
around
and
sort
of
waved
his
hand
at
us
then
he
put
his
thumb
to
his
nose
and
wiggled
his
fingers
at
the
japanese
that
was
the
last
we
saw
of
him
for
the
mule
yanked
him
around
a
clump
of
trees
and
out
of
sight
i
looked
at
mark
and
grinned
and
mark
looked
at
me
says
he
here
says
i
mean
quick
trouble
us
says
he
be
afraid
go
after
him
says
i
he
know
enough
seems
like
he
was
sort
of
crazy
or
mark
shook
his
head
can
tell
says
he
chapter
xx
the
hammering
down
below
kept
on
steadily
for
an
hour
or
so
then
there
was
silence
for
quite
a
while
i
expect
while
the
army
was
getting
rested
and
recovering
its
grit
it
was
beginning
to
grow
dusk
before
we
saw
a
single
japanese
mark
held
a
council
of
war
it
much
of
a
council
if
that
word
means
people
talking
together
and
offering
one
another
advice
mark
did
most
of
the
talking
and
all
of
the
advising
it
because
he
accept
advice
no
sir
he
that
sort
of
fellow
at
all
he
was
always
glad
to
listen
and
to
change
his
own
plan
if
somebody
offered
a
better
one
but
right
now
he
was
the
only
one
that
had
any
plan
he
was
the
rest
of
us
fellows
were
pretty
good
at
doing
things
we
were
told
and
maybe
we
were
up
to
the
average
on
brains
but
mark
was
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
there
anyhow
he
had
a
different
kind
of
brain
it
was
the
kind
that
help
scheming
and
figuring
so
the
council
of
war
consisted
mainly
in
his
telling
us
what
to
do
hold
this
of
defenses
says
he
be
long
before
we
have
to
make
a
strategic
retirement
to
the
next
floor
our
last
stronghold
and
the
we
can
hold
out
there
it
rains
i
hope
says
i
get
a
that
still
on
your
mind
tallow
well
the
first
minute
i
have
to
spare
get
you
a
that
a
promise
says
i
says
he
that
settled
it
if
mark
tidd
said
get
water
then
water
would
be
got
i
was
satisfied
you
to
get
it
plunk
says
know
yet
says
mark
now
that
just
like
him
he
knew
there
must
be
way
of
getting
water
up
there
and
he
was
sure
if
there
was
a
way
he
could
find
it
i
wish
i
was
as
confident
of
myself
as
that
maybe
why
mark
is
more
thought
of
by
folks
than
we
he
never
gives
up
and
because
he
knows
if
anybody
can
do
a
thing
he
can
do
it
too
have
to
says
he
not
at
the
next
attack
but
soon
if
the
man
uses
the
scheme
of
retreat
right
we
have
time
says
i
run
up
the
stairs
and
pull
them
up
after
us
it
so
we
will
says
he
you
see
thought
it
all
out
and
was
ready
for
anything
of
course
he
did
make
mistakes
once
in
a
while
like
forgetting
the
water
but
that
was
seldom
as
uncle
ike
bond
said
when
he
bought
a
citron
because
his
bad
eyesight
made
him
think
it
was
a
muskmelon
best
of
make
says
mark
want
to
know
when
to
the
two
guards
want
to
know
got
farther
to
run
have
to
have
a
signal
the
minute
they
hear
it
or
you
hear
it
forget
everything
but
how
to
get
to
the
of
those
stairs
the
quickest
way
there
is
the
signal
will
be
two
screeches
like
he
showed
us
and
they
were
screeches
for
certain
a
catamount
would
have
been
so
proud
of
them
have
jumped
out
of
his
skin
i
guess
a
catamount
that
could
yowl
like
that
would
be
a
sort
of
among
his
folks
and
pay
to
hear
him
perform
that
do
says
mark
says
i
like
that
and
we
have
to
retreat
scare
the
japs
stiff
so
fall
and
their
right
says
he
tallow
go
and
tell
motu
and
i
went
off
to
tell
them
motu
was
leaning
on
the
railing
looking
over
when
i
got
there
business
says
i
he
looked
at
me
sort
of
blank
then
he
smiled
so
all
his
fine
white
teeth
showed
between
his
lips
tallow
it
is
an
american
question
i
understand
to
be
sure
how
is
business
there
has
not
been
business
i
have
not
had
a
do
you
say
single
he
stopped
and
looked
sort
of
disappointed
boys
have
had
all
the
fighting
he
says
fight
for
motu
yet
motu
has
no
part
in
let
that
worry
you
says
i
is
as
important
as
and
harder
to
do
i
expect
besides
says
i
you
was
to
keep
pirates
from
a
treasure
you
bring
it
right
up
to
the
where
they
could
grab
it
and
run
no
sir
keep
it
back
where
it
would
be
safe
well
motu
our
treasure
after
a
manner
of
speaking
to
keep
the
japanese
from
you
so
we
want
you
back
where
they
haul
you
off
in
the
maybe
says
he
not
honorable
strategy
for
the
treasure
where
others
fight
for
you
you
should
fight
also
for
yourself
and
not
in
the
rear
rank
but
in
front
let
no
man
be
struck
a
blow
in
your
defense
that
you
yourself
can
take
so
my
father
taught
i
sort
of
figured
it
out
that
motu
had
the
right
sort
of
a
father
my
grandfather
fought
in
our
war
and
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
he
used
to
tell
me
he
was
great
on
honor
granddad
was
i
told
motu
about
him
because
i
want
him
to
think
american
boys
taught
about
honor
as
much
as
japanese
boys
were
get
enough
before
through
with
this
says
i
worry
about
a
little
then
i
went
on
and
told
binney
who
seen
any
of
the
enemy
either
he
was
worried
though
about
a
that
grew
pretty
close
to
a
window
been
thinking
that
maybe
a
man
could
climb
it
and
get
out
on
a
limb
that
almost
touched
the
wall
and
from
there
jump
smack
through
a
window
it
looked
possible
to
me
by
this
time
it
was
getting
quite
dark
and
i
hurried
back
to
the
stairs
where
plunk
and
mark
were
sitting
mark
had
another
big
sandwich
for
each
of
us
so
i
carried
supplies
to
motu
and
binney
both
of
them
asked
for
water
so
i
told
them
we
were
just
out
of
it
but
would
have
a
fresh
supply
soon
binney
kicked
a
little
about
it
but
motu
just
smiled
and
said
we
have
to
have
water
your
mark
tidd
will
get
i
went
back
to
my
place
again
mark
had
a
couple
of
blankets
spread
on
the
floor
men
says
he
and
plunk
take
with
binney
and
about
you
says
i
sleep
for
me
he
said
with
that
look
around
his
jaw
that
means
no
use
arguing
the
general
of
this
army
and
my
is
to
be
on
the
give
you
a
little
time
to
think
about
water
then
says
i
for
i
was
still
considerable
up
about
that
mark
grinned
like
the
cat
that
ate
the
he
always
grins
like
that
when
got
the
best
of
you
so
i
knew
he
had
been
figuring
about
water
and
had
found
a
way
to
get
it
a
bag
up
with
the
provisions
says
he
it
i
ran
up
and
got
it
and
then
sat
down
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
mark
took
the
bag
and
measured
it
careful
then
he
took
some
of
the
was
about
six
feet
of
it
twisted
and
turned
and
braided
it
into
a
hoop
just
a
mite
smaller
than
the
top
of
the
bag
when
that
was
done
he
put
it
inside
the
bag
about
two
inches
down
and
folded
the
thick
tough
paper
over
it
then
with
string
out
of
his
pocket
he
wound
it
over
and
over
punching
holes
every
little
ways
to
pass
the
string
through
he
was
mighty
careful
and
particular
about
it
when
it
was
all
done
he
had
a
bucket
that
would
hold
a
good
gallon
of
water
another
short
piece
of
wire
made
the
handle
says
he
hold
says
i
the
quite
a
step
down
how
you
to
reach
it
enemy
us
to
reach
it
with
says
he
pointing
to
the
we
had
captured
reach
i
sure
enough
it
would
all
we
had
to
do
was
drive
a
nail
in
the
end
and
make
a
hook
of
it
to
hold
the
pail
i
was
so
thirsty
i
could
hardly
wait
so
i
grabbed
the
contraption
as
soon
as
mark
finished
it
and
rushed
off
to
where
i
could
reach
water
it
worked
a
little
clumsy
but
it
did
the
business
i
have
much
trouble
filling
the
pail
better
believe
water
never
tasted
so
good
before
mark
was
perfectly
willing
to
drink
and
plunk
got
away
with
about
a
quart
motu
act
very
excited
about
it
though
he
drank
hearty
enough
told
you
says
he
your
mark
tidd
could
do
binney
was
last
to
get
a
drink
that
the
pail
the
rest
in
another
paper
bag
says
mark
tie
it
with
a
string
hang
it
of
it
will
stay
long
enough
then
your
bucket
again
and
hang
that
we
run
any
more
says
plunk
it
was
now
pretty
dark
the
moon
showed
just
a
little
but
there
were
clouds
which
kept
covering
it
up
and
when
they
did
you
see
a
dozen
feet
away
but
you
could
hear
we
listened
like
plunk
told
us
to
and
heard
several
men
scurrying
around
down
below
then
the
moon
popped
out
the
clearest
it
had
been
and
we
saw
scheme
says
mark
under
his
breath
knew
it
it
was
a
scheme
all
right
the
man
had
made
a
regular
of
planks
it
was
just
as
wide
as
the
stairs
and
high
enough
to
cover
a
man
other
planks
about
three
feet
long
made
a
roof
to
it
so
we
get
at
the
attackers
from
above
one
man
was
right
behind
it
and
all
four
of
the
others
were
close
to
him
hanging
on
to
a
that
pushed
it
it
was
a
sort
of
except
that
you
batter
with
just
pushed
it
along
in
front
of
you
and
shoved
anybody
out
of
the
way
there
a
way
in
the
world
for
us
to
stop
them
screech
them
screeches
says
i
to
mark
a
minute
says
he
me
with
that
mark
had
the
barrel
of
heavy
stuff
the
barrel
itself
was
one
of
those
big
oil
barrels
and
weighed
about
a
ton
we
rolled
it
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
till
i
give
the
says
he
i
let
out
the
signal
give
her
a
we
waited
till
the
portable
fort
was
a
quarter
of
the
way
up
then
mark
opened
his
mouth
and
gave
the
two
screeches
they
were
better
than
the
sample
he
had
given
us
before
at
that
we
both
pushed
and
down
rushed
and
bumped
and
clattered
the
barrel
it
got
under
way
and
began
to
jump
the
last
five
steps
before
it
reached
the
movable
fort
never
were
touched
at
all
the
barrel
just
seemed
to
come
to
life
and
leap
at
the
enemy
like
it
was
trained
maybe
it
was
i
be
surprised
if
mark
had
found
some
way
to
train
it
anyhow
it
jumped
at
those
japs
and
hit
their
shelter
just
above
the
center
maybe
it
hit
it
wow
that
barrel
and
the
things
in
it
must
have
weighed
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
and
it
was
going
fast
says
mark
to
plunk
and
me
i
stopped
just
long
enough
to
see
the
shelter
smash
backward
and
break
away
from
the
that
pushed
it
the
barrel
went
right
over
it
and
you
should
have
seen
those
japanese
hop
out
of
the
way
then
i
headed
up
like
been
sent
for
in
a
hurry
plunk
beat
me
binney
was
right
at
my
heels
next
came
motu
and
mark
brought
up
the
rear
says
he
up
the
we
grabbed
her
and
pulled
it
a
second
too
soon
for
the
man
himself
came
bounding
up
the
stairs
below
and
made
a
jump
for
the
end
of
the
stairs
we
were
pulling
up
he
caught
it
too
and
hung
there
says
mark
him
to
motu
grinned
and
grabbed
his
lance
you
could
see
he
had
a
job
he
liked
he
went
to
where
he
could
reach
the
man
whose
hands
were
now
on
a
level
with
our
floor
and
reached
under
i
saw
him
draw
back
his
lance
for
a
jab
and
the
jab
went
home
right
into
the
stummick
it
went
says
the
man
or
something
that
sounded
like
it
and
dropped
like
a
stone
he
sat
where
he
fell
or
rather
rolled
over
on
his
side
with
both
arms
folded
across
his
beltline
and
there
he
stayed
till
a
couple
of
his
men
came
and
picked
him
up
he
act
very
chipper
for
ten
minutes
we
are
says
mark
fastening
the
wire
that
held
up
the
stairs
cut
this
and
they
to
us
with
if
they
come
got
to
come
through
the
floor
in
an
airship
or
up
these
is
a
strong
place
to
defend
says
motu
hunger
and
thirst
are
stronger
for
a
time
we
can
hold
out
maybe
days
maybe
a
week
but
in
the
end
we
must
give
up
is
it
not
so
mark
tidd
got
an
idee
says
mark
any
up
be
done
by
chapter
xxi
the
japanese
came
stamping
and
jabbering
around
under
us
but
that
do
any
particular
good
that
i
could
see
and
after
a
while
they
quieted
down
i
guess
they
were
pretty
tired
after
their
work
and
wanted
a
rest
anyhow
they
bother
us
again
that
night
the
first
thing
mark
had
us
do
was
make
stronger
the
fastening
of
the
stairs
it
was
held
by
a
double
wire
and
a
rope
we
used
up
all
the
wire
we
had
left
putting
on
more
fastenings
and
when
we
got
through
we
felt
pretty
safe
for
a
while
it
would
take
anybody
more
than
a
minute
to
get
those
stairs
down
we
were
certain
now
we
were
so
high
up
they
have
any
ladders
that
could
reach
us
and
we
need
to
bother
watching
anything
but
the
stairs
so
four
of
us
went
to
sleep
while
one
watched
plunk
was
the
unlucky
one
he
drew
the
shortest
stick
he
was
to
watch
from
nine
till
twelve
binney
from
twelve
to
three
and
motu
the
rest
of
the
night
when
that
was
arranged
i
rolled
up
in
my
blanket
on
the
floor
and
went
to
sleep
maybe
say
that
a
comfortable
bed
but
it
suited
me
i
was
perfectly
satisfied
the
way
i
felt
i
guess
have
been
glad
to
lie
down
on
a
pile
of
cobblestones
with
a
boulder
for
a
pillow
i
went
to
sleep
so
quick
i
hardly
remember
lying
down
and
i
never
wiggled
till
morning
from
nine
till
six
i
slept
and
would
have
been
willing
to
go
on
for
a
couple
of
hours
more
but
mark
tidd
shook
me
and
yelled
in
my
ear
that
breakfast
was
ready
such
as
it
was
while
we
were
eating
i
got
to
thinking
about
things
and
says
to
mark
they
find
any
way
to
get
these
stairs
down
goners
because
they
can
use
their
movable
fort
and
come
prancing
right
up
to
about
that
fort
says
mark
i
guess
i
very
smart
not
to
see
a
way
to
stop
it
before
they
get
us
with
that
thingumbob
he
says
you
stop
says
i
that
we
captured
come
in
handy
it
got
water
with
it
now
stop
the
fort
with
when
they
they
ever
just
jam
one
end
of
our
against
their
fort
and
the
other
end
of
it
against
a
step
have
to
shove
the
whole
citadel
over
into
the
to
move
be
just
like
against
a
stone
what
says
i
says
he
have
to
come
out
and
fight
got
better
than
an
even
chance
the
dog
says
i
thinking
of
him
all
of
a
sudden
mark
shrugged
his
shoulders
says
he
left
him
on
if
we
had
him
we
might
use
him
and
it
sort
of
goes
against
the
grain
to
be
men
with
a
fight
with
a
crocodile
if
i
had
one
says
i
and
let
it
go
at
that
ought
to
be
around
pretty
soon
says
binney
they
leave
us
alone
much
longer
get
all
out
of
the
habit
of
with
worry
says
mark
have
to
form
any
habits
we
apt
to
have
time
to
habit
unless
we
do
it
two
letters
at
a
down
there
now
says
plunk
over
our
defenses
quite
a
spell
says
mark
noticed
him
says
motu
may
expect
a
stirring
up
of
something
of
course
as
soon
as
the
man
saw
the
way
we
had
the
stairs
fastened
up
with
stout
wire
know
there
any
use
trying
to
cut
it
with
a
knife
like
he
did
the
rope
on
the
stairs
below
likewise
unless
he
was
a
better
schemer
than
mark
tidd
he
be
able
to
figure
out
any
other
place
to
attack
us
than
right
up
those
stairs
so
if
he
got
us
there
was
where
he
would
have
to
come
and
he
would
have
to
discover
some
plan
to
get
down
our
stairs
to
climb
up
it
might
have
been
easy
if
he
was
where
he
could
get
tools
but
it
customary
to
leave
many
valuable
tools
laying
around
an
abandoned
hotel
and
he
have
very
much
to
work
with
i
guess
he
was
a
bit
dubious
himself
for
he
came
and
stood
where
we
could
see
him
and
called
up
to
us
up
the
stairs
says
he
wish
to
be
speaking
and
talking
with
you
eh
ahead
says
mark
are
tangled
up
like
trap
with
bunny
rabbit
in
it
says
the
man
can
go
at
all
by
any
means
oh
no
you
are
very
fast
and
tight
is
it
not
without
loud
arguments
so
comfortable
says
mark
seen
us
to
go
away
have
you
will
surrender
up
voluntary
eh
there
has
been
fight
and
bickering
plenty
for
everybody
for
boys

have
fight
like
bantam
rooster
oh
yes
like
everything

are
finished
up

mark
leetle
japanese
bad
naughty
leetle
japanese
boy

now
give
him
to
me
in

handy
present

beautiful
presents

like
to
be
owners
can
wait
for
christmas
says
mark
in
any
hurry
for
but
butter
and
bread
and
vittle
eh
there
are
stomachs
that
are
lonesome
for
feed
to
be
certainly
sure
there
is
thirstiness
it
is
bad
and
not
a
pleasant
happening
to
be
thirsty
suppose
i
am
staying
here
three
days
maybe
a
week
how
is
that
you
will
be
starving
and
thirsting
what
then
eh
says
mark
hungry
just
word
be
to
lend
you
some
grub
got
to
last
till
far
far
are
a
like
a
mule
you
do
not
listen
to
commonest
sense
no
must
i
come
to
take
away
the
bad
leetle
japanese
boy
must
if
you
get
him
but
so
far
at
it
from
the
of
view
of
a
man
not
you
had
much
so
will
buy
and
paying
very
generous
for
the
leetle
boy
how
much
any
little
boys
for
sale
mister
and
now
be
about
all
this
is
over
if
you
gone
from
there
by
the
time
i
count
ten
open
git
the
man
stared
up
a
moment
through
his
one
and
grinned
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
before
mark
had
counted
ten
he
was
out
of
range
after
that
we
saw
a
couple
of
the
enemy
go
over
to
the
hotel
i
expect
they
were
rummaging
around
for
something
to
use
to
cut
our
wire
they
must
have
searched
good
for
we
see
them
come
back
for
two
hours
and
one
of
them
had
an
ax
in
his
hand
good
do
says
i
reach
with
an
says
mark
can
a
longer
handle
on
it
they
which
is
just
what
they
did
it
took
quite
a
while
to
cut
it
and
get
it
ready
so
that
it
was
after
eleven
when
they
started
operations
then
a
man
came
out
with
the
ax
on
a
long
handle
and
commenced
chopping
at
the
wire
there
was
only
a
crack
a
couple
of
inches
wide
that
we
could
shoot
through
and
i
guess
we
bother
him
much
anyhow
he
stayed
there
and
swung
his
ax
on
our
wires
they
were
good
and
tough
but
at
last
he
had
one
cut
through
that
was
the
first
part
of
the
end
of
things
right
there
in
half
an
hour
the
last
wire
parted
and
down
went
the
stairs
the
way
was
except
for
us
fellows
with
our
lances
and
slingshots
at
the
top
the
man
take
any
chances
though
the
first
thing
he
brought
up
his
movable
fort
and
sheltered
behind
it
they
began
the
attack
says
mark
four
of
us
grabbed
it
up
and
stood
holding
it
till
mark
said
the
word
says
he
and
we
aimed
the
scantling
right
at
the
middle
of
the
fort
and
whanged
it
with
all
our
might
bet
it
jarred
them
good
and
plenty
anyhow
they
stopped
and
mark
ran
down
a
couple
of
steps
to
pick
up
the
scantling
and
fix
it
with
one
end
against
their
shelter
and
the
other
end
against
a
step
they
were
stopped
they
heaved
and
pushed
and
strained
but
it
any
good
they
reach
over
the
top
of
their
fort
because
built
a
roof
there
for
their
own
protection
and
there
they
were
they
could
push
all
they
wanted
to
the
more
they
pushed
the
more
tired
get
and
the
more
fun
have
at
last
they
tried
lifting
their
contraption
from
the
bottom
and
grabbing
our
brace
but
that
any
good
we
held
it
just
out
of
reach
and
peppered
every
arm
that
stuck
out
fifteen
minutes
of
that
and
they
saw
they
were
outgeneraled
so
they
retreated
shelter
and
all
they
had
gained
a
stairs
were
down
but
we
had
gained
a
bigger
had
beaten
them
off
even
when
they
came
at
us
with
their
patent
engine
of
war
we
were
pretty
tickled
i
can
tell
you
but
the
man
beaten
in
twenty
minutes
he
was
back
again
with
his
fort
to
make
another
try
the
fort
looked
just
like
it
looked
before
but
we
soon
found
out
it
was
whole
heap
different
we
jabbed
it
with
the
scantling
again
but
this
time
what
do
you
calculate
happened
why
they
just
dropped
off
a
board
about
the
middle
backed
away
an
inch
or
so
grabbed
the
end
of
our
scantling
and
pulled
the
end
through
the
hole
where
the
board
had
been
then
they
came
right
on
up
it
looked
like
some
new
kind
of
spider
climbing
his
thread
for
as
they
came
on
the
scantling
went
right
inside
and
disappeared
like
the
fort
swallowed
it
of
course
we
tried
to
haul
the
scantling
back
but
they
held
on
to
it
in
spite
of
all
our
wrenching
and
jerking
and
waggling
they
kept
their
end
and
climbed
right
on
slow
and
sure
done
says
i
to
mark
yet
says
he
you
keep
says
motu
will
fight
side
by
side
with
then
mark
spoke
short
and
sharp
obey
orders
says
he
on
a
warrior
you
know
what
orders
are
keep
motu
looked
a
bit
ashamed
and
awful
disappointed
but
he
did
what
mark
told
him
it
must
have
been
hard
for
him
just
then
but
it
was
the
best
plan
get
all
the
you
need
pretty
quick
says
mark
and
motu
smiled
back
at
him
we
back
any
longer
says
mark
through
this
door
and
slam
it
shut
gain
a
the
use
time
says
binney
make
much
difference
if
beat
now
or
in
half
an
heap
of
can
happen
in
half
an
hour
says
mark
give
up
till
we
hang
on
one
more
they
were
almost
on
to
us
now
the
fort
was
at
the
top
step
plunk
jumped
to
the
far
side
and
began
jabbing
like
with
his
lance
says
mark
and
then
those
japanese
just
boiled
out
from
behind
their
fort
and
came
at
us
we
kept
motu
behind
and
fought
the
best
we
could
if
it
been
for
our
lances
we
have
lasted
long
but
we
kept
together
in
a
knot
so
they
get
behind
us
and
everlastingly
poked
them
with
the
padded
ends
of
our
weapons
finally
a
man
dropped
sudden
to
his
knees
and
dived
under
he
grabbed
plunk
and
they
went
to
the
floor
together
and
rolled
over
and
over
plunk
trying
to
get
away
the
man
trying
to
hold
him
the
door
quick
mark
yelled
he
knew
plunk
suffer
much
damage
but
we
afford
to
lose
another
man
by
the
same
tactics
and
we
rescue
plunk
so
we
jumped
backward
through
the
door
and
just
had
time
to
slam
it
in
their
faces
we
get
it
to
stay
shut
though
so
we
could
lock
it
for
the
next
five
minutes
it
was
a
question
of
strength
they
pushed
in
and
we
pushed
out
but
there
were
five
of
them
to
four
of
us
and
we
were
boys
little
by
little
they
forced
us
back
until
one
of
them
squeezed
through
we
had
to
give
back
then
the
hall
was
so
narrow
only
two
of
us
could
fight
abreast
and
the
luck
fell
to
mark
and
binney
motu
and
i
got
as
close
behind
as
we
could
and
used
our
lances
whenever
we
got
a
chance
it
was
pretty
hot
work
i
can
tell
you
then
binney
turned
his
ankle
and
fell
and
before
he
could
scramble
up
the
enemy
had
him
now
there
were
just
three
of
us
and
they
forced
us
back
step
by
step
the
hall
was
long
and
narrow
there
was
no
chance
to
take
us
on
the
flank
so
they
had
to
come
straight
on
but
they
seemed
willing
enough
now
it
was
just
a
matter
of
time
pretty
soon
they
would
push
us
back
to
the
end
of
the
hall
and
close
in
on
us
and
we
would
be
done
for
after
that
motu
would
be
theirs
and
we
would
have
stood
the
siege
in
vain
think
the
japanese
were
having
a
pleasant
time
for
they
a
really
hurt
you
but
it
can
muss
you
up
a
lot
and
a
good
stiff
punch
will
make
you
see
stars
bet
there
a
man
in
the
lot
of
them
that
seen
a
whole
fourth
of
july
of
fireworks
but
they
meant
business
nothing
could
stop
them
and
on
they
fought
then
before
i
realized
how
far
we
had
gone
i
backed
slam
into
motu
who
was
jammed
against
the
wall
it
was
our
last
stand
and
we
made
it
a
good
one
it
long
before
they
had
us
wedged
so
tight
we
wiggle
and
then
hands
grabbed
me
it
was
all
over
of
course
i
thrashed
around
the
best
i
could
and
i
expect
the
others
were
doing
the
same
but
it
long
before
they
had
me
good
and
fast
it
any
use
to
struggle
so
i
laid
quiet
feeling
pretty
tired
and
sore
and
sorry
and
then
would
you
believe
me
but
i
heard
a
sound
that
sent
the
life
and
courage
back
into
me
with
a
jump
mark
i
yelled
heard
it
tallow
says
he
the
japanese
heard
it
too
for
they
looked
pretty
startled
and
stared
at
each
other
then
we
heard
the
sound
again
it
was
the
toot
of
an
automobile
horn
the
kind
of
horn
you
hear
on
great
big
cars
i
yelled
over
yet
the
japanese
were
listening
and
for
a
minute
my
man
hang
on
to
me
as
tight
as
he
ought
to
i
gave
a
sudden
wrench
and
rolled
out
from
under
him
before
he
could
lay
hands
on
me
again
i
was
up
and
running
down
that
hall
faster
than
the
man
who
won
the
dash
in
the
olympic
games
i
plunged
out
of
the
door
and
threw
myself
the
japanese
was
right
at
my
heels
but
at
the
ground
floor
he
stopped
for
just
across
the
bridge
was
a
car
with
seven
or
eight
men
in
it
some
white
some
japanese
and
just
getting
out
was
a
little
japanese
gentleman
with
a
tall
silk
hat
and
a
i
yelled
just
in
time
quick
in
a
minute
the
whole
of
them
were
out
of
the
car
and
hurrying
toward
me
chapter
xxii
the
little
japanese
gentleman
kept
ahead
in
spite
of
his
silk
hat
and
when
he
got
to
me
he
grabbed
me
by
the
arm
and
shook
me
is
he
he
says
his
voice
shaking
with
worry
and
excitement
harm
come
to
him
says
i
it
was
rapid
when
i
saw
him
last
bring
on
your
i
turned
and
ran
toward
the
citadel
with
the
whole
pack
of
them
at
my
heels
just
as
we
got
to
the
bridge
the
man
who
will
come
with
a
couple
of
his
men
at
his
back
came
tearing
but
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
reinforcements
they
stopped
and
hesitated
and
then
began
to
climb
back
again
the
little
japanese
gentleman
shouted
something
in
an
angry
voice
and
put
on
more
steam
so
that
he
passed
me
and
got
to
the
stairs
first
we
all
ran
up
in
a
crowd
for
a
minute
the
man
stood
at
the
top
as
though
make
a
fight
for
it
but
panic
got
him
i
guess
and
he
turned
like
lost
his
head
and
tried
to
scoot
three
ways
at
once
we
pounded
right
up
and
two
of
our
japanese
grabbed
him
by
the
arms
he
even
struggle
three
of
his
followers
huddled
back
in
a
corner
of
the
gallery
glowering
and
sullen
but
frightened
and
the
reinforcements
attended
to
them
is
he
the
little
japanese
gentleman
demanded
and
i
pointed
through
the
door
just
as
mark
and
motu
shoved
the
fourth
of
the
men
out
of
the
way
and
stepped
into
sight
then
a
surprising
thing
happened
the
dignified
little
japanese
gentleman
silk
hat
and
and
all
went
right
down
on
his
knees
and
bowed
so
his
face
was
almost
rubbing
against
the
boards
and
in
a
strangled
voice
said
something
in
their
own
language
to
motu
who
stopped
with
the
greatest
look
of
surprise
at
sight
of
him
then
motu
stood
still
and
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
smiled
hard
to
say
just
how
he
looked
but
i
guess
stately
is
the
only
word
for
it
he
looked
like
a
boy
who
was
used
to
having
folks
go
down
on
their
knees
and
rub
their
noses
in
the
splinters
for
him
he
said
something
to
the
little
japanese
gentleman
who
got
up
on
his
feet
his
face
working
and
his
eyes
blinking
as
if
he
was
so
happy
he
was
about
to
cry
is
well
you
have
come
motu
says
to
him
in
english
ears
of
my
serene
uncle
shall
hear
how
you
there
shall
be
fresh
honors
and
distinctions
for
one
who
already
stands
among
the
are
safe
you
are
untouched
by
the
hands
of
these
pigs
if
one
has
so
much
as
defiled
your
sacred
person
with
the
touch
of
a
friend
says
motu
with
a
gentle
smile
are
in
the
little
gentleman
glared
back
at
the
man
and
his
army
they
are
safe
but
let
them
once
return
to
their
shall
be
their
punishment
says
motu
again
in
life
shall
they
set
foot
on
the
shores
of
our
land
never
shall
their
unworthy
eyes
gaze
on
its
beauties
never
again
behold
the
majesty
of
sacred
fuji
yama
in
foreign
lands
far
from
the
graves
of
their
ancestors
shall
they
pass
away
and
in
their
native
villages
their
names
shall
be
spoken
with
bitter
words
and
reviling
that
is
my
will
in
the
while
motu
spoke
his
face
had
been
stern
but
not
cruel
or
vindictive
he
had
spoken
like
a
great
and
just
judge
passing
sentence
on
the
guilty
now
he
turned
to
four
of
us
for
plunk
and
binney
were
with
us
again
rumpled
and
battered
a
bit
with
their
clothes
ready
to
go
into
the
friends
says
he
me
present
to
you
count
takisuji
minister
from
the
imperial
court
of
japan
to
the
united
well
sir
you
could
have
bought
me
for
a
cent
here
was
a
boy
smaller
than
me
and
a
foreign
minister
went
down
on
his
knees
and
risked
getting
a
sliver
in
his
nose
at
sight
of
him
i
felt
all
fluffy
inside
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
a
great
man
man
great
enough
to
be
the
representative
of
an
empire
at
the
capital
of
our
now
that
we
saw
him
we
discovered
been
hobnobbing
with
and
bossing
and
fooling
around
with
a
fellow
that
such
a
man
bowed
and
scraped
to
it
was
sure
amazing
motu
went
on
speaking
four
count
says
he
the
best
and
bravest
friends
i
have
ever
known
they
came
upon
me
in
foreigner
poor
wearing
the
clothes
i
now
wear
but
they
asked
no
questions
sought
no
reward
befriended
me
out
of
the
largeness
of
their
hearts
for
the
honor
of
their
fatherland
motu
i
was
to
them
and
nothing
poor
japanese
boy
who
needed
friends
they
took
me
in
fed
me
gave
me
lodging
then
when
he
motu
nodded
toward
the
man
who
will
fought
for
for
me
like
warriors
of
ancient
days
when
men
were
greater
and
wiser
and
stronger
than
they
are
then
he
set
to
and
told
them
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
he
omit
a
thing
he
told
about
mark
strategy
and
about
my
swimming
and
about
the
bravery
and
faithfulness
of
binney
and
plunk
and
everything
then
he
introduced
each
of
us
by
name
says
he
mark
tidd
our
general
but
for
the
wisdom
and
cunning
of
his
brain
your
coming
would
have
been
have
been
any
says
i
forgetting
myself
and
interrupting
the
count
frowned
but
motu
smiled
and
asked
why
then
i
told
him
about
the
letter
mark
wrote
to
the
japanese
minister
and
how
he
had
figured
out
that
motu
was
somebody
important
the
minister
nodded
was
the
letter
brought
me
says
he
might
have
known
says
motu
but
mark
tidd
could
have
brought
you
but
how
did
he
send
the
letter
tallow
now
that
was
embarrassing
i
want
to
do
any
bragging
about
myself
and
i
muttered
under
my
breath
and
got
red
and
felt
like
i
was
standing
close
to
a
furnace
out
of
the
tail
of
my
eye
i
saw
mark
tidd
grin
he
knew
how
i
was
feeling
all
right
was
like
this
motu
says
he
and
again
i
saw
the
count
frown
but
motu
shook
his
head
at
him
off
the
other
night
and
swam
the
with
the
letter
and
got
a
man
to
mail
it
he
was
just
back
again
when
the
enemy
made
a
on
our
motu
bowed
to
me
as
natural
and
graceful
as
could
be
and
i
tried
to
bow
back
but
i
was
pretty
clumsy
about
it
we
have
much
practice
in
that
sort
of
politeness
here
which
maybe
any
credit
to
us
was
a
fine
deed
a
brave
deed
tallow
the
story
of
that
swim
the
story
of
your
dive
from
the
balcony
shall
not
he
went
on
introducing
us
and
the
minister
shook
hands
with
each
of
us
are
of
the
samurai
says
motu
and
the
count
raised
his
eyebrows
with
surprise
i
see
why
then
but
later
i
found
out
of
them
count
is
entitled
to
wear
the
short
sword
and
to
see
the
face
of
says
the
count
would
be
well
to
tell
these
young
men
for
whom
they
have
been
fighting
in
these
days
when
your
secret
was
not
known
they
have
grown
familiar
it
did
no
harm
but
is
not
seemly
for
them
or
for
motu
smiled
again
and
patted
mark
on
the
shoulder
it
shall
be
as
it
is
now
to
these
four
i
shall
be
motu
their
true
friend
and
companion
in
dangers
they
shall
speak
to
me
by
no
title
nor
shall
they
bow
to
me
or
treat
me
otherwise
than
as
one
of
american
boy
so
shall
i
be
proud
to
be
known
and
accepted
but
you
may
tell
them
count
who
i
the
count
bowed
low
highness
is
kind
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
express
you
have
been
honored
as
few
have
been
honored
yet
i
count
takisuji
say
it
is
deserved
him
whom
you
have
served
is
his
highness
prince
motu
nephew
to
his
ineffable
majesty
emperor
of
says
i
half
under
my
breath
we
caught
a
big
motu
laughed
remember
says
he
you
i
am
still
i
shall
be
but
motu
your
true
friend
forever
at
your
mark
tidd
was
squinting
his
little
eyes
and
wrinkling
his
stub
of
a
nose
want
to
act
like
i
was
curious
says
he
what
in
is
a
royal
alone
in
the
mountains
here
from
what
read
of
princes
it
exactly
a
habit
with
them
to
be
ten
miles
from
home
alone
in
borrowed
shall
know
mark
tidd
for
it
is
your
right
the
story
reflects
small
credit
on
a
part
of
my
countrymen
you
know
mark
that
of
late
there
has
been
talk
of
war
between
your
land
and
mine
it
has
made
the
heart
of
my
uncle
heavy
with
sorrow
for
he
knows
much
of
your
united
states
and
his
friendship
is
truly
yours
but
misunderstandings
have
arisen
our
people
have
been
inflamed
against
you
by
men
who
are
no
better
than
traitors
your
people
have
been
made
to
feel
bitter
against
us
even
those
in
power
at
washington
and
in
tokio
have
been
led
astray
but
his
majesty
my
uncle
was
not
led
astray
and
he
knew
your
president
was
wise
and
just
so
saying
nothing
to
any
he
sent
me
his
relative
as
a
special
and
personal
envoy
to
your
president
with
words
and
assurances
of
peace
a
message
he
gave
to
my
keeping
which
would
assure
your
president
that
a
lasting
peace
depended
on
you
he
stopped
and
thought
a
moment
then
went
on
my
mission
was
discovered
by
traitors
who
desire
war
because
it
will
be
of
profit
to
them
they
want
to
see
built
and
cannon
men
slain
well
they
knew
the
state
of
the
public
mind
how
a
spark
might
cause
an
explosion
that
even
the
emperor
could
not
withstand
with
me
they
planned
to
make
that
spark
my
land
says
motu
people
are
kind
to
me
they
have
given
me
their
affection
it
is
good
so
these
traitors
said
to
themselves
if
harm
comes
to
prince
motu
in
the
united
states
there
will
be
war
the
people
will
lay
the
blame
on
the
united
states
and
peace
will
be
destroyed
so
they
made
their
plot
came
with
but
two
attendants
none
knew
my
name
as
a
simple
japanese
boy
i
traveled
i
came
across
your
country
for
days
then
one
night
as
i
stood
on
a
little
station
platform
while
the
train
stood
still
the
man
with
his
followers
seized
me
quietly
and
carried
me
away
what
happened
thereafter
i
do
not
know
except
what
has
happened
to
me
they
brought
me
to
these
places
and
here
i
escaped
a
week
before
you
came
i
traveled
miles
on
foot
and
found
refuge
in
this
old
hotel
then
you
came
that
is
the
story
so
you
see
you
have
served
not
only
motu
your
friend
but
your
land
and
my
the
count
nodded
gravely
has
been
kept
secret
in
i
have
been
informed
and
secretly
i
have
made
search
for
you
your
followers
came
to
me
but
could
give
no
aid
not
until
the
letter
of
mark
tidd
came
did
i
have
hope
then
with
all
speed
i
came
here
as
the
representative
of
my
country
young
men
i
wish
to
thank
you
for
the
service
you
have
rendered
do
it
on
purpose
says
mark
any
difference
whether
motu
was
a
prince
or
a
day
laborer
he
was
in
a
bad
fix
and
it
looked
like
it
was
our
to
stick
by
him
he
have
thought
much
of
the
united
states
if
we
would
he
we
just
did
by
him
like
like
to
have
japanese
boys
do
by
us
if
we
got
in
a
scrape
over
is
a
sentiment
reflecting
credit
on
the
teaching
of
your
fathers
and
on
the
ideals
of
your
country
says
the
count
there
was
quite
a
bit
more
palavering
which
ended
up
by
motu
asking
us
to
come
on
with
him
to
the
summer
home
and
stay
there
he
said
have
to
scoot
down
to
washington
but
would
be
back
in
a
day
or
two
we
talked
it
over
and
motu
persuaded
us
got
to
see
ames
who
owns
the
says
mark
been
damaged
some
got
to
take
care
of
shall
be
my
care
says
the
count
shall
be
amply
paid
for
all
motu
was
looking
at
the
man
and
his
followers
of
a
sudden
he
took
a
step
toward
them
of
the
body
you
escape
because
of
the
nature
of
this
matter
but
punishment
of
the
soul
you
shall
not
escape
one
and
all
you
are
traitors
to
your
land
and
pointed
scornfully
at
the
the
most
despicable
because
if
you
would
you
could
be
of
value
to
your
emperor
you
have
cast
aside
your
honor
and
your
manhood
your
names
shall
be
spoken
with
loathing
my
sentence
you
have
again
shall
you
see
or
set
foot
on
the
soil
of
your
native
land
now
not
one
of
them
opened
his
mouth
but
every
one
scurried
off
as
fast
as
he
could
travel
probably
they
were
afraid
motu
might
change
his
mind
and
boil
them
in
oil
or
do
whatever
disagreeable
thing
is
customary
in
such
cases
over
in
japan
they
take
the
road
but
started
to
break
and
run
into
the
woods
but
they
just
then
something
more
unexpected
than
a
japanese
minister
happened
those
woods
all
of
a
sudden
came
to
life
the
bushes
just
fairly
seethed
and
out
came
charging
about
twenty
of
the
biggest
old
american
ever
saw
and
every
one
of
them
had
his
sleeves
rolled
up
for
business
behind
them
on
foot
this
time
came
the
old
fellow
with
the
mule
mark
was
right
that
old
fellow
had
gone
off
and
given
warning
what
motu
said
to
the
man
about
escaping
punishment
of
the
body
was
considerable
of
a
mistake
i
should
say
it
was
those
big
farmers
just
came
down
on
the
man
and
his
followers
like
a
roof
was
falling
on
them
why
the
japanese
have
a
chance
even
to
start
to
fight
back
in
about
two
seconds
every
last
one
of
them
was
grabbed
and
held
fast
by
a
couple
of
men
in
overalls
the
farmers
led
their
prisoners
over
toward
us
said
the
man
that
was
ahead
as
how
there
was
some
furriners
boys
over
here
so
we
come
to
obliged
says
mark
and
he
introduced
the
farmers
to
motu
and
the
count
and
you
can
guess
those
farmers
were
pretty
surprised
they
bump
into
a
minister
and
a
real
live
prince
every
day
but
it
flabbergast
them
any
no
sir
i
was
proud
of
them
somehow
they
seemed
to
get
dignified
and
to
look
like
somebody
in
particular
i
understand
it
for
a
minute
but
pretty
soon
i
saw
what
it
was
good
american
citizenship
they
knew
who
and
what
they
were
and
they
were
proud
of
it
princes
or
ministers
make
them
feel
ashamed
for
they
knew
in
their
hearts
that
princes
and
ministers
were
just
men
like
themselves
we
do
with
these
here
vermin
asked
the
leader
of
the
farmers
have
granted
that
they
go
free
said
motu
they
are
forever
banished
from
said
the
farmer
go
all
right
what
they
done
to
you
you
can
overlook
if
you
want
to
but
so
far
as
these
kids
go
a
different
thing
these
japanese
men
have
bothered
and
so
i
kin
see
tried
actually
to
these
american
boys
us
men
stand
by
to
see
leetle
fellers
nor
anybody
harmed
if
we
can
help
it
seems
like
to
do
motu
bowed
matter
is
in
your
hands
he
said
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
too
the
farmers
talked
together
a
minute
then
they
carried
their
prisoners
out
on
our
dock
one
farmer
got
ahold
of
the
head
and
one
of
the
feet
of
the
man
two
three
called
out
the
leader
and
the
man
went
whirling
through
the
air
head
over
heels
till
he
splashed
down
in
the
lake
right
after
him
came
one
of
his
men
as
fast
as
one
crawled
back
on
to
the
dock
the
farmers
would
jerk
him
up
and
duck
him
again
i
laughed
till
i
almost
busted
my
belt
even
the
japanese
minister
was
smiling
a
little
enough
said
the
leader
in
a
few
minutes
turn
chase
forgit
got
toes
to
your
boots
off
scooted
the
nearly
drowned
i
right
on
their
heels
swooped
the
farmers
they
forget
the
toes
on
their
boots
either
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
them
would
swing
up
his
leg
and
catch
a
japanese
right
where
his
pants
were
that
japanese
would
pretty
nearly
double
the
distance
he
was
planning
on
for
the
next
jump
we
watched
them
our
sides
aching
so
we
dare
laugh
again
until
they
disappeared
justice
said
the
count
his
eyes
all
twinkly
do
it
differently
in
maybe
we
could
learn
from
you
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
we
got
in
the
big
automobile
and
went
to
the
summer
home
and
stayed
there
three
weeks
then
we
had
to
go
home
and
so
did
motu
we
felt
pretty
bad
when
we
said
to
him
for
after
all
we
were
just
boys
and
he
was
a
prince
away
off
in
japan
so
we
be
likely
ever
to
see
him
again
but
he
said
he
would
see
us
and
would
write
to
us
times
a
year
i
shall
write
until
the
last
year
of
your
lives
and
mine
nor
must
our
hearts
be
sad
at
this
parting
for
fear
we
not
meet
again
for
i
motu
promise
you
we
shall
meet
and
here
is
my
hand
on
we
got
aboard
the
train
and
then
stood
waving
to
him
and
the
count
as
long
as
we
could
see
them
pretty
soon
we
went
in
and
sat
down
and
speak
for
a
long
time
we
were
thinking
about
the
whole
adventure
and
what
it
had
meant
to
us
and
to
our
countries
beats
all
says
mark
after
a
while
gets
made
or
get
ever
think
we
fellows
had
headed
off
a
war
with
japan
says
i
well
we
got
back
to
wicksville
and
in
a
couple
of
months
the
whole
thing
seemed
like
a
dream
i
was
beginning
to
think
it
was
a
dream
when
one
day
what
should
happen
but
word
from
mark
tidd
to
come
right
to
his
house
i
hurried
over
and
found
plunk
and
binney
and
a
japanese
gentleman
from
washington
there
he
was
some
sort
of
attaché
of
the
legation
and
you
believe
it
but
he
had
for
each
of
us
a
piece
of
parchment
covered
with
japanese
writing
and
big
gold
seals
he
told
us
they
made
us
some
sort
of
nobles
in
japan
and
regular
samurai
warriors
besides
that
there
was
a
present
for
each
of
us
from
short
swords
like
the
one
of
his
we
found
that
day
at
the
hotel
they
were
all
carved
on
the
handles
and
engraved
on
the
blades
and
note
said
they
were
hundreds
of
years
old
and
had
been
carried
by
four
of
greatest
warriors
the
note
ended
up
many
men
have
worn
these
swords
since
they
were
forged
but
none
will
own
them
more
worthily
than
my
four
american
boy
friends
whenever
you
look
on
these
swords
think
of
your
friend
motu
who
speaks
your
names
every
day
and
counts
the
hours
till
he
shall
see
you
again
hope
we
do
see
him
sometime
says
i
bet
says
mark
tidd
a
prince
never
hurt
him
a
bit
i
never
knew
a
boy
i
me
says
i
then
the
messenger
gave
us
another
note
addressed
to
all
of
us
on
paper
from
the
white
house
it
was
short
but
there
was
a
name
at
the
end
of
it
that
made
it
more
valuable
than
a
hundred
pages
from
anybody
that
name
was
the
name
of
the
president
my
dear
friends
says
the
note
have
served
your
country
well
in
the
matter
we
know
of
and
your
country
thanks
you
as
your
president
i
like
to
think
there
are
thousands
of
american
boys
who
would
have
acted
as
truly
and
wisely
and
bravely
as
you
did
then
he
signed
his
name
after
the
messenger
was
gone
and
we
had
talked
things
over
for
a
while
i
says
we
go
next
summer
fellows
know
says
mark
tidd
planned
a
quiet
vacation
this
time
and
see
what
we
got
plan
a
sort
of
outing
next
year
or
a
cruise
or
a
up
the
amazon
among
savages
then
probably
end
up
by
having
a
comfortable
undisturbed
cozy
things
seem
to
go
by
this
one
was
a
mighty
contrary
says
plunk
and
we
all
agreed
with
him
