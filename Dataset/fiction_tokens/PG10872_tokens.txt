for
the
first
few
days
after
his
return
sunwich
was
full
of
surprises
to
jem
hardy
the
town
itself
had
changed
but
little
and
the
older
inhabitants
were
for
the
most
part
easily
recognisable
but
time
had
wrought
wonders
among
the
younger
members
of
the
population
small
boys
had
attained
to
whiskered
manhood
and
small
girls
passing
into
young
women
had
in
some
cases
even
changed
their
names
the
most
astounding
and
gratifying
instance
of
the
wonders
effected
by
time
was
that
of
miss
nugent
he
saw
her
first
at
the
window
and
with
a
ready
recognition
of
the
enchantment
lent
by
distance
took
the
first
possible
opportunity
of
a
closer
observation
he
then
realized
the
enchantment
afforded
by
proximity
the
second
opportunity
led
him
impetuously
into
a
draper
shop
where
a
magnificent
after
first
ceremoniously
handing
him
a
high
cane
chair
passed
on
his
order
for
pins
in
a
deep
and
thrilling
baritone
and
retired
in
good
order
illustration
the
most
astounding
and
gratifying
instance
of
the
wonders
effected
by
time
was
that
of
miss
nugent
by
the
end
of
a
week
his
observations
were
completed
and
kate
nugent
securely
enthroned
in
his
mind
as
the
incarnation
of
feminine
grace
and
beauty
left
but
little
room
for
other
matters
on
his
second
sunday
at
home
to
his
father
great
surprise
he
attended
church
and
after
contemplating
miss
nugent
back
hair
for
an
hour
and
a
half
came
home
and
spoke
eloquently
and
nobly
on
burying
hatchets
healing
old
sores
letting
bygones
be
bygones
and
kindred
topics
i
never
take
much
notice
of
sermons
myself
said
the
captain
misunderstanding
sermon
said
his
son
i
was
thinking
of
the
sermon
but
i
saw
captain
nugent
there
and
i
remembered
the
stupid
quarrel
between
you
it
absurd
that
it
should
go
on
indefinitely
why
what
does
it
matter
inquired
the
other
staring
why
it
perhaps
it
the
music
that
affected
you
some
of
those
old
hymns
it
was
the
sermon
and
it
was
the
hymns
said
his
son
disdainfully
it
just
common
sense
it
seems
to
me
that
the
enmity
between
you
has
lasted
long
enough
i
do
see
that
it
matters
said
the
captain
it
does
hurt
me
nugent
goes
his
way
and
i
go
mine
but
if
i
ever
get
a
chance
at
the
old
man
he
better
look
out
he
wants
a
little
of
the
starch
taken
out
of
him
mere
mannerism
said
his
son
he
as
proud
as
lucifer
and
his
girl
takes
after
him
said
the
innocent
captain
by
the
way
she
grown
up
a
very
girl
you
take
a
look
at
her
the
next
time
you
see
her
his
son
stared
at
him
she
get
married
soon
i
should
think
continued
the
other
young
murchison
the
new
doctor
here
seems
to
be
the
favourite
nugent
is
backing
him
so
they
say
i
wish
him
joy
of
his
jem
hardy
took
his
pipe
into
the
garden
and
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
the
narrow
paths
determined
at
any
costs
to
save
murchison
from
such
a
and
kate
nugent
from
any
husband
except
of
his
choosing
he
took
a
seat
under
an
old
apple
tree
and
musing
in
the
twilight
tried
in
vain
to
think
of
ways
and
means
of
making
her
acquaintance
meantime
they
passed
each
other
as
strangers
and
the
difficulty
of
approaching
her
only
made
the
task
more
alluring
in
the
second
week
he
reckoned
up
that
he
had
seen
her
nine
times
it
was
a
satisfactory
total
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
shut
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
five
times
out
of
that
number
he
had
seen
murchison
as
well
and
neither
of
them
appeared
to
have
seen
him
he
sat
thinking
it
over
in
the
office
one
hot
afternoon
adolphus
swann
his
partner
had
just
returned
from
lunch
and
for
about
the
fifth
time
that
day
was
arranging
his
white
hair
and
short
neatly
pointed
beard
in
a
small
over
the
top
of
it
he
glanced
at
hardy
who
leaning
back
in
his
chair
bit
his
pen
and
stared
hard
at
a
paper
before
him
is
that
the
manifest
of
the
north
star
he
inquired
no
was
the
reply
swann
put
his
away
and
watched
the
other
as
he
crossed
over
to
the
window
and
gazed
through
the
small
dirty
panes
at
the
bustling
life
of
the
harbour
below
for
a
short
time
hardy
stood
gazing
in
silence
and
then
suddenly
crossing
the
room
took
his
hat
from
a
peg
and
went
out
restless
said
the
senior
partner
wiping
his
folders
with
great
care
and
putting
them
on
wonder
where
he
put
that
manifest
he
went
over
to
the
other
desk
and
opened
a
drawer
to
search
for
it
just
inside
was
a
sheet
of
foolscap
and
swann
with
growing
astonishment
slowly
mastered
the
contents
illustration
swann
with
growing
astonishment
slowly
mastered
the
contents
see
her
as
often
as
possible
get
to
know
some
of
her
friends
try
and
get
hold
of
the
old
lady
find
out
her
tastes
and
ideas
show
my
hand
before
murchison
has
it
all
his
own
way
it
seems
to
me
said
the
bewildered
shipbroker
carefully
replacing
the
paper
that
my
young
friend
is
looking
out
for
another
partner
he
has
lost
much
time
he
went
back
to
his
seat
and
resumed
his
work
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
ought
to
let
his
partner
know
what
he
had
seen
and
when
hardy
returned
he
had
barely
seated
himself
before
swann
with
a
mysterious
smile
crossed
over
to
him
bearing
a
sheet
of
foolscap
try
and
dress
as
well
as
my
partner
read
the
astonished
hardy
what
the
matter
with
my
clothes
what
do
you
mean
swann
in
place
of
answering
returned
to
his
desk
and
taking
up
another
sheet
of
foolscap
began
to
write
again
holding
up
his
hand
for
silence
as
hardy
repeated
his
question
when
he
had
finished
his
task
he
brought
it
over
and
placed
it
in
the
other
hand
take
her
little
brother
out
for
walks
hardy
crumpled
the
paper
up
and
flung
it
aside
then
with
his
face
crimson
he
stared
wrathfully
at
the
benevolent
swann
it
the
safest
card
in
the
pack
said
the
latter
you
please
everybody
especially
the
little
brother
you
should
always
hold
his
hand
it
looks
well
for
one
thing
and
if
you
shut
your
eyes
i
do
want
any
of
your
nonsense
said
the
maddened
jem
what
do
you
mean
by
reading
my
private
papers
i
came
over
to
look
for
the
manifest
said
swann
and
i
read
it
before
i
could
make
out
what
it
was
you
must
admit
it
a
bit
cryptic
i
thought
it
was
a
new
game
at
first
getting
hold
of
the
old
lady
sounds
like
a
sort
of
buff
but
why
not
get
hold
of
the
young
one
why
waste
time
over
go
to
the
devil
said
the
junior
partner
any
more
suggestions
i
can
give
you
you
are
heartily
welcome
to
said
swann
going
back
to
his
seat
all
my
vast
experience
is
at
your
service
and
the
best
and
sweetest
and
prettiest
girls
in
sunwich
regard
me
as
a
sort
of
second
father
what
a
second
father
inquired
jim
looking
up
a
grandfather
go
your
own
way
said
the
other
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
you
not
in
earnest
or
you
clutch
at
any
straw
but
let
me
give
you
one
word
of
advice
be
careful
how
you
get
hold
of
the
old
lady
let
her
understand
from
the
commencement
that
it
is
her
hardy
went
on
with
his
work
there
was
a
pile
of
it
in
front
of
him
and
an
accumulation
in
his
drawers
for
some
time
he
wrote
assiduously
but
work
was
dry
after
the
subject
they
had
been
discussing
he
looked
over
at
his
partner
and
seeing
that
that
gentleman
was
gravely
busy
reopened
the
matter
with
a
jeer
old
maids
always
know
most
about
rearing
children
he
remarked
so
i
suppose
old
bachelors
looking
down
on
life
from
the
top
shelf
think
they
know
most
about
marriage
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
repeated
the
senior
placidly
i
am
not
to
be
taunted
into
rendering
first
aid
to
the
wounded
the
junior
lost
his
presence
of
mind
who
trying
to
taunt
you
he
demanded
hotly
why
you
do
more
harm
than
good
put
a
bandage
round
the
head
instead
of
the
heart
i
expect
assented
the
chuckling
swann
top
shelf
i
think
you
said
well
i
climbed
there
for
safety
you
must
have
been
much
run
after
said
his
partner
i
was
said
the
other
i
suppose
that
why
it
is
i
am
always
so
interested
in
these
affairs
i
have
helped
to
marry
so
many
people
in
this
place
that
i
almost
afraid
to
stir
out
after
dark
hardy
reply
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
edward
silk
a
young
man
of
forlorn
aspect
who
combined
in
his
person
the
offices
of
messenger
cleaner
and
to
the
firm
he
brought
in
some
letters
and
placing
them
on
swann
desk
retired
there
another
said
the
latter
as
the
door
closed
his
complaint
is
amelia
kybird
and
he
got
it
badly
she
big
enough
to
eat
him
but
i
believe
that
they
are
engaged
perseverance
has
done
it
in
his
case
he
used
to
go
about
like
a
blighted
flower
i
am
rather
busy
his
partner
reminded
him
swann
sighed
and
resumed
his
own
labours
for
some
time
both
men
wrote
in
silence
then
the
elder
suddenly
put
his
pen
down
and
hit
his
desk
a
noisy
thump
with
his
fist
i
got
it
he
said
briskly
apologize
humbly
for
all
your
candour
and
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
information
which
shall
brighten
your
dull
eyes
raise
the
corners
of
your
drooping
mouth
and
renew
once
more
the
pink
and
cream
in
your
youthful
cheeks
look
here

overwrought

number

at
home
fridays
seven
to
nine
to
the
daughter
of
his
late
skipper
who
always
visits
him
on
that
day
do
thank
me
hardy
in
case
you
break
down
she
a
very
nice
girl
and
if
she
had
been
born
twenty
years
earlier
or
i
had
been
born
twenty
years
later
or
you
had
been
born
at
all
there
no
saying
what
might
not
have
happened
when
i
want
you
to
interfere
in
my
business
said
hardy
working
sedulously
i
let
you
know
very
good
replied
swann
still
remember
thursdays
seven
to
nine
thursdays
said
hardy
incautiously
why
you
said
fridays
just
now
swann
made
no
reply
his
nose
was
immersed
in
the
folds
of
a
large
handkerchief
and
his
eyes
watered
profusely
behind
his
glasses
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
had
regained
his
normal
composure
and
even
then
the
sensitive
nerves
of
his
partner
were
offended
by
an
occasional
belated
chuckle
although
by
dint
of
casual
and
cautious
inquiries
hardy
found
that
his
partner
information
was
correct
he
was
by
no
means
guilty
of
any
feelings
of
gratitude
towards
him
and
he
only
glared
scornfully
when
that
excellent
but
frivolous
man
mounted
a
chair
on
friday
afternoon
and
putting
the
clock
on
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
urged
him
to
be
in
time
the
evening
however
found
him
starting
slowly
in
the
direction
of
fullalove
alley
his
father
had
gone
to
sea
again
and
the
house
was
very
dull
moreover
he
felt
a
mild
curiosity
to
see
the
changes
wrought
by
time
in
wilks
he
walked
along
by
the
sea
and
as
the
church
clock
struck
the
turned
into
the
alley
and
looked
eagerly
round
for
the
old
steward
the
labours
of
the
day
were
over
and
the
inhabitants
were
for
the
most
part
out
of
doors
taking
the
air
householders
leaning
against
their
smoking
exchanged
ideas
across
the
narrow
space
paved
with
which
separated
their
small
and
ancient
houses
while
the
matrons
more
gregariously
inclined
bunched
in
little
groups
and
discussed
subjects
which
in
higher
circles
would
have
inundated
the
land
with
libel
actions
up
and
down
the
alley
a
tiny
boy
all
ready
for
bed
with
the
exception
of
his
nightgown
mechanically
avoided
friendly
palms
as
he
sought
anxiously
for
his
mother
illustration
fullalove
alley
the
object
of
hardy
search
sat
at
the
door
of
his
front
room
which
opened
on
to
the
alley
smoking
an
evening
pipe
and
noting
with
an
interested
eye
the
doings
of
his
neighbours
he
was
just
preparing
to
draw
himself
up
in
his
chair
as
the
intruder
passed
when
to
his
utter
astonishment
that
gentleman
stopped
in
front
of
him
and
taking
possession
of
his
hand
shook
it
fervently
how
do
you
do
he
said
smiling
wilks
eyed
him
stupidly
and
releasing
his
hand
coyly
placed
it
in
his
and
breathed
hard
i
meant
to
come
before
said
hardy
but
i
been
so
busy
how
are
you
wilks
still
dazed
muttered
that
he
was
very
well
then
he
sat
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
and
eyed
his
visitor
suspiciously
i
been
longing
for
a
chat
with
you
about
old
times
said
hardy
of
all
my
old
friends
you
seem
to
have
changed
the
least
you
do
look
a
day
older
i
getting
on
said
wilks
trying
to
speak
coldly
but
observing
with
some
gratification
the
effect
produced
upon
his
neighbours
by
the
appearance
of
this
acquaintance
i
wanted
to
ask
your
advice
said
the
unscrupulous
hardy
speaking
in
low
tones
i
daresay
you
know
i
just
gone
into
partnership
in
sunwich
and
i
told
there
no
man
knows
more
about
the
business
and
the
ins
and
outs
of
this
town
than
you
do
wilks
thawed
despite
himself
his
face
glistened
and
his
huge
mouth
broke
into
tremulous
smiles
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
and
then
noticing
that
a
little
group
near
them
had
suspended
their
conversation
to
listen
to
his
he
drew
his
chair
back
and
in
a
kind
voice
invited
the
searcher
after
wisdom
to
step
inside
hardy
thanked
him
and
following
him
in
took
a
chair
behind
the
door
and
with
an
air
of
youthful
deference
bent
his
ear
to
catch
the
pearls
which
fell
from
the
lips
of
his
host
since
he
was
a
babe
on
his
mother
knee
sixty
years
before
wilks
had
never
had
such
an
attentive
and
admiring
listener
hardy
sat
as
though
glued
to
his
chair
one
eye
on
wilks
and
the
other
on
the
clock
and
it
was
not
until
that
ancient
timepiece
struck
the
hour
that
the
suddenly
realized
the
awkward
state
of
affairs
any
more
i
can
give
you
i
shall
always
be
pleased
to
he
said
looking
at
the
clock
hardy
thanked
him
at
great
length
wondering
as
he
spoke
whether
miss
nugent
was
of
punctual
habits
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
folding
his
arms
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
perturbed
wilks
you
must
come
round
and
smoke
a
pipe
with
me
sometimes
he
said
casually
wilks
flushed
with
gratified
pride
he
had
a
vision
of
himself
walking
up
to
the
front
door
of
the
hardys
smoking
a
pipe
in
a
room
and
telling
an
incredulous
and
envious
fullalove
alley
about
it
afterwards
i
shall
be
very
pleased
sir
he
said
impressively
come
round
on
tuesday
said
his
visitor
i
shall
be
at
home
then
wilks
thanked
him
and
spurred
on
to
hospitality
murmured
something
about
a
glass
of
ale
and
retired
to
the
back
to
draw
it
he
came
back
with
a
jug
and
a
couple
of
glasses
and
draining
his
own
at
a
draught
hoped
that
the
example
would
not
be
lost
upon
his
visitor
that
astute
person
however
after
a
modest
draught
sat
still
anchored
to
the
glass
i
expecting
somebody
said
the
at
last
no
doubt
you
have
a
lot
of
visitors
said
the
other
admiringly
wilks
did
not
deny
it
he
eyed
his
guest
glass
and
fidgeted
miss
nugent
is
coming
he
said
instead
of
any
signs
of
disorder
and
preparations
for
rapid
flight
wilks
saw
that
the
other
was
quite
composed
he
began
to
entertain
a
poor
idea
of
hardy
memory
she
generally
comes
for
a
little
quiet
chat
he
said
indeed
just
between
the
two
of
us
said
the
other
his
visitor
said
indeed
and
as
though
some
chord
of
memory
had
been
touched
sat
gazing
dreamily
at
wilks
horticultural
collection
in
the
window
then
he
changed
colour
a
little
as
a
smart
hat
and
a
pretty
face
crossed
the
tiny
panes
wilks
changed
colour
too
and
in
an
awkward
fashion
rose
to
receive
miss
nugent
late
as
usual
sam
said
the
girl
sinking
into
a
chair
then
she
caught
sight
of
hardy
who
was
standing
by
the
door
illustration
she
caught
sight
of
hardy
it
a
long
time
since
you
and
i
met
miss
nugent
he
said
bowing
mr
hardy
said
the
girl
doubtfully
yes
miss
interposed
wilks
anxious
to
explain
his
position
he
called
in
to
see
me
quite
a
surprise
to
me
it
was
i
knowed
him
the
last
time
we
three
met
said
hardy
who
to
his
host
discomfort
had
resumed
his
chair
wilks
was
thrashing
me
and
you
were
urging
him
on
kate
nugent
eyed
him
carefully
it
was
preposterous
that
this
young
man
should
take
advantage
of
a
boy
and
girl
acquaintance
of
eleven
years
before
and
such
an
acquaintance
in
this
manner
her
eyes
expressed
a
little
surprise
not
unmixed
with
hauteur
but
hardy
was
too
pleased
to
have
them
turned
in
his
direction
at
all
to
quarrel
with
their
expression
you
were
a
bit
of
a
trial
in
them
days
said
wilks
shaking
his
head
if
i
live
to
be
ninety
i
shall
never
forget
seeing
miss
kate
capsized
the
way
she
was
the
way
she
how
is
your
cold
inquired
miss
nugent
hastily
better
miss
thankee
said
wilks
miss
nugent
has
forgotten
and
forgiven
all
that
long
ago
said
hardy
quite
assented
the
girl
coldly
one
can
not
remember
all
the
boys
and
girls
one
knew
as
a
child
certainly
not
said
hardy
i
find
that
many
have
slipped
from
my
own
memory
but
i
have
a
most
vivid
recollection
of
you
miss
nugent
looked
at
him
again
and
an
idea
strange
and
incredible
dawned
slowly
upon
her
childish
impressions
are
lasting
and
jem
hardy
had
remained
in
her
mind
as
a
sort
of
youthful
ogre
he
sat
before
her
now
a
frank
young
englishman
in
whose
honest
eyes
admiration
of
herself
could
not
be
concealed
indignation
and
surprise
struggled
for
supremacy
it
odd
remarked
wilks
who
had
a
happy
knack
at
times
of
saying
the
wrong
thing
it
odd
you
should
to
come
just
at
the
same
time
as
miss
kate
did
it
my
good
fortune
said
hardy
with
a
slight
bow
then
he
cocked
a
malignant
eye
at
the
innocent
wilks
and
wondered
at
what
age
men
discarded
the
useless
habit
of
blushing
opposite
him
sat
miss
nugent
calmly
observant
the
slightest
suggestion
of
disdain
in
her
expression
framed
in
the
queer
old
chair
which
had
belonged
to
wilks
grandfather
she
made
a
picture
at
which
jem
hardy
continued
to
gaze
with
respectful
ardour
a
hopeless
sense
of
possessed
him
but
the
idea
that
murchison
should
aspire
to
so
much
goodness
and
beauty
made
him
almost
despair
of
his
sex
his
reverie
was
broken
by
the
voice
of
wilks
a
quarter
to
eight
said
that
gentleman
it
ca
be
i
thought
it
was
later
than
that
said
hardy
simply
wilks
gasped
and
with
a
faint
shake
of
his
head
at
the
floor
abandoned
the
thankless
task
of
giving
hints
to
a
young
man
who
was
too
obtuse
to
see
them
and
it
was
not
until
some
time
later
that
hardy
sorely
against
his
inclinations
gave
his
host
a
hearty
handshake
and
with
a
respectful
bow
to
miss
nugent
took
his
departure
fine
young
man
he
growed
said
wilks
deferentially
turning
to
his
remaining
visitor
greatly
improved
i
think
miss
nugent
looked
him
over
critically
before
replying
he
seems
to
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
you
she
remarked
wilks
smiled
a
satisfied
smile
he
came
to
ask
my
advice
about
business
he
said
softly
he
two
or
three
speak
o
me
as
knowing
a
thing
or
two
and
being
young
and
just
starting
came
to
talk
it
over
with
me
i
never
see
a
young
man
so
pleased
and
ready
to
take
advice
as
wot
he
is
he
is
coming
again
for
more
i
suppose
said
miss
nugent
carelessly
wilks
acquiesced
and
he
asked
me
to
go
over
to
his
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
on
tuesday
he
added
in
the
casual
manner
in
which
men
allude
to
their
aristocratic
connections
he
a
bit
lonely
all
by
himself
miss
nugent
said
indeed
and
then
lapsing
into
silence
gave
little
occasional
at
wilks
as
though
in
search
of
any
hidden
charms
about
him
which
might
hitherto
have
escaped
her
at
the
same
time
james
hardy
walking
slowly
home
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
pondered
on
further
ways
and
means
of
ensnaring
the
affection
of
the
chapter
vii
the
anticipations
of
wilks
were
more
than
realized
on
the
following
tuesday
from
the
time
a
trim
maid
showed
him
into
the
until
late
at
night
when
he
left
a
feted
and
honoured
guest
with
one
of
his
host
best
cigars
between
his
teeth
nothing
that
could
yield
him
any
comfort
was
left
undone
in
the
easiest
of
easy
chairs
he
sat
in
the
garden
beneath
the
leafy
branches
of
apple
trees
and
undiluted
wisdom
and
advice
flowed
from
his
lips
in
a
stream
as
he
beamed
delightedly
upon
his
entertainer
illustration
undiluted
wisdom
and
advice
flowed
from
his
lips
their
talk
was
mainly
of
sunwich
and
sunwich
people
and
it
was
an
easy
step
from
these
to
equator
lodge
on
that
subject
most
people
would
have
found
the
somewhat
garrulous
but
jem
hardy
listened
with
great
content
and
even
brought
him
back
to
it
when
he
showed
signs
of
wandering
altogether
wilks
spent
one
of
the
pleasantest
evenings
of
his
life
and
returning
home
in
a
slight
state
of
mental
exhilaration
severely
exercised
the
tongues
of
fullalove
alley
by
a
bearing
considered
incompatible
with
his
station
jem
hardy
paid
a
return
call
on
the
following
friday
and
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
any
lack
of
warmth
in
his
reception
the
was
delighted
to
see
him
and
after
showing
him
various
curios
picked
up
during
his
voyages
took
him
to
the
small
yard
in
the
rear
festooned
with
beans
and
gave
him
a
chair
in
full
view
of
the
neighbours
i
the
only
visitor
said
hardy
after
an
hour
patient
listening
and
waiting
wilks
nodded
casually
miss
kate
came
last
night
he
said
friday
is
her
night
but
she
came
yesterday
instead
hardy
said
oh
indeed
and
fell
into
a
dismal
reverie
from
which
the
most
spirited
efforts
of
his
host
only
partially
aroused
him
without
giving
way
to
undue
egotism
it
was
pretty
clear
that
miss
nugent
had
changed
her
plans
on
his
account
and
a
long
vista
of
pleasant
friday
evenings
suddenly
vanished
he
too
resolved
to
vary
his
visits
and
starting
with
a
basis
of
two
a
week
sat
trying
to
solve
the
mathematical
chances
of
selecting
the
same
as
kate
nugent
calculations
which
were
not
facilitated
by
a
account
from
wilks
of
certain
interesting
amours
of
his
youthful
prime
before
he
saw
kate
nugent
again
however
another
old
acquaintance
turned
up
safe
and
sound
in
sunwich
captain
nugent
walking
into
the
town
saw
him
first
a
tall
young
man
in
shabby
clothing
whose
bearing
even
in
the
distance
was
oddly
familiar
as
he
came
closer
the
misgivings
were
confirmed
and
in
the
sunburnt
fellow
in
tattered
clothes
who
advanced
upon
him
with
hand
he
reluctantly
recognized
his
son
what
have
you
come
home
for
he
inquired
ignoring
the
hand
and
eyeing
him
from
head
to
foot
change
said
jack
nugent
laconically
as
the
smile
left
his
face
the
captain
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stood
silent
his
son
looked
first
up
the
road
and
then
down
all
well
at
home
he
inquired
yes
jack
nugent
looked
up
the
road
again
not
much
change
in
the
town
he
said
at
length
no
said
his
father
well
i
glad
to
have
seen
you
said
his
son
said
the
captain
his
son
nodded
and
turning
on
his
heel
walked
back
towards
the
town
despite
his
forlorn
appearance
his
step
was
jaunty
and
he
carried
his
head
high
the
captain
watched
him
until
he
was
hidden
by
a
bend
in
the
road
and
then
ashamed
of
himself
for
displaying
so
much
emotion
turned
his
own
steps
in
the
direction
of
home
well
he
did
whine
he
said
slowly
he
got
a
bit
of
pride
left
meantime
the
prodigal
had
reached
the
town
again
and
stood
ruefully
considering
his
position
he
looked
up
the
street
and
then
the
shop
of
kybird
catching
his
eye
walked
over
and
inspected
the
contents
of
the
window
belts
and
watches
were
displayed
alluringly
behind
the
glass
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
a
row
of
cheap
clothing
dangling
from
short
poles
over
the
shop
front
all
the
goods
were
marked
in
plain
figures
in
reduced
circumstances
kybird
giving
a
soaring
imagination
play
in
the
first
marking
and
a
good
business
faculty
in
the
second
at
these
valuables
jack
nugent
with
a
view
of
obtaining
some
idea
of
prices
gazed
for
some
time
then
passing
between
two
suits
of
oilskins
which
stood
as
sentinels
in
the
doorway
he
entered
the
shop
and
smiled
affably
at
miss
kybird
who
was
in
charge
at
his
entrance
she
put
down
a
piece
of
which
kybird
called
his
sock
and
with
a
casual
glance
at
his
clothes
regarded
him
with
a
prejudiced
eye
beautiful
day
said
the
customer
makes
one
feel
quite
young
again
what
do
you
want
inquired
miss
kybird
illustration
do
you
want
inquired
miss
kybird
nugent
turned
to
a
broken
which
stood
by
the
counter
and
after
applying
severe
tests
regardless
of
the
lady
feelings
sat
down
upon
it
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
i
walked
from
london
he
said
in
explanation
i
could
sit
here
for
hours
look
here
began
the
indignant
miss
kybird
only
people
would
be
sure
to
couple
our
names
together
continued
nugent
mournfully
when
a
handsome
young
man
and
a
girl
do
you
want
to
buy
anything
or
not
demanded
miss
kybird
with
an
impatient
toss
of
her
head
no
said
jack
i
want
to
sell
you
come
to
the
wrong
shop
then
said
miss
kybird
the
warehouse
is
full
of
rubbish
now
the
other
turned
in
his
chair
and
looked
hard
at
the
window
so
it
is
he
assented
it
a
good
job
i
brought
you
something
decent
to
put
there
he
felt
in
his
pockets
and
producing
a
a
battered
watch
a
knife
and
a
few
other
small
articles
deposited
them
with
reverent
care
upon
the
counter
no
use
to
us
declared
miss
kybird
anxious
to
hit
back
we
burn
coal
here
these
burn
better
than
the
coal
you
buy
said
the
unmoved
customer
well
we
do
want
them
retorted
miss
kybird
raising
her
voice
and
i
do
want
any
of
your
impudence
get
up
out
of
our
chair
her
heightened
tones
penetrated
to
the
small
and
untidy
room
behind
the
shop
the
door
opened
and
kybird
in
his
appeared
at
the
opening
wot
the
row
he
demanded
his
little
black
eyes
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
only
a
lovers
quarrel
replied
jack
you
go
away
we
do
want
you
look
we
do
want
none
o
your
nonsense
said
the
shopkeeper
sharply
and
wot
more
we
wo
it
who
put
that
rubbish
on
my
counter
he
bustled
forward
and
taking
the
articles
in
his
hands
examined
them
closely
three
shillings
for
the
lot
cash
he
remarked
done
said
the
other
did
i
say
three
inquired
kybird
startled
at
this
ready
acceptance
five
you
said
replied
nugent
but
i
take
three
if
you
throw
in
a
smile
kybird
much
against
his
inclinations
threw
in
a
faint
grin
and
opening
a
drawer
produced
three
shillings
and
flung
them
separately
on
the
counter
miss
kybird
thawed
somewhat
and
glancing
from
the
customer
clothes
to
his
face
saw
that
he
had
a
pleasant
eye
and
a
good
moustache
together
with
a
general
air
of
recklessness
much
appreciated
by
the
sex
do
spend
it
on
drink
she
remarked
not
unkindly
i
wo
said
the
other
solemnly
i
going
to
buy
house
property
with
it
why
darn
my
eyes
said
kybird
who
had
been
regarding
him
closely
darn
my
old
eyes
if
it
ai
young
nugent
well
well
that

said
young
nugent
cheerfully
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
kybird
same
old
face
same
old
voice
same
old
come
now
objected
the
shopkeeper
shortening
his
arm
and
squinting
along
it
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
continued
the
other
mournfully
and
here
i
thrown
up
a
splendid
berth
and
come
all
the
way
from
australia
just
for
one
glimpse
of
miss
kybird
and
she
does
know
me
when
i
die
kybird
you
will
find
the
word
engraven
upon
my
heart
kybird
said
oh
indeed
his
daughter
tossed
her
head
and
bade
nugent
take
his
nonsense
to
people
who
might
like
it
last
time
i
see
you
said
kybird
pursing
up
his
lips
and
gazing
at
the
counter
in
an
effort
of
memory
last
time
i
see
you
was
one
fifth
november
when
you
an
another
bright
young
party
was
going
about
in
two
suits
o
oilskins
wot
i
been
for
and
low
all
day
long
jack
nugent
sighed
they
were
happy
times
kybird
might
ha
been
for
you
retorted
the
other
his
temper
rising
a
little
at
the
remembrance
of
his
wrongs
have
you
come
home
for
good
inquired
miss
kybird
curiously
have
you
seen
your
father
he
passed
here
a
little
while
ago
i
saw
him
said
jack
with
a
brevity
which
was
not
lost
upon
the
astute
kybird
i
may
stay
in
sunwich
and
i
may
not
it
all
depends
you
not
going
said
kybird
no
the
shopkeeper
stood
considering
he
had
a
small
room
to
let
at
the
top
of
his
house
and
he
stood
divided
between
the
fear
of
not
getting
his
rent
and
the
joy
to
a
man
fond
of
simple
pleasures
to
be
obtained
by
dunning
the
arrogant
captain
nugent
for
his
son
debts
before
he
could
arrive
at
a
decision
his
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
stout
lady
from
the
back
parlour
who
having
conquered
his
scruples
against
matrimony
some
thirty
years
before
had
kept
a
particularly
eye
upon
him
ever
since
your
tea
cold
she
remarked
severely
her
husband
received
the
news
with
calmness
he
was
by
no
means
an
enthusiast
where
that
liquid
was
concerned
the
admiration
evoked
by
its
qualities
having
been
always
something
in
the
nature
of
a
mystery
to
him
i
coming
he
retorted
i
just
a
word
with
nugent
well
i
never
did
said
the
stout
lady
coming
farther
into
the
shop
and
regarding
the
visitor
i
should
knowed
if
you
asked
me
who
was
i
could
ha
told
you
i
should
knowed
from
adam
jack
shook
his
head
it
hard
to
be
forgotten
like
this
he
said
sadly
even
miss
kybird
had
forgotten
me
after
all
that
had
passed
between
us
eh
said
kybird
oh
do
take
any
notice
of
him
said
his
daughter
i
like
to
see
myself
kybird
paid
no
heed
he
was
still
thinking
of
the
son
of
captain
nugent
being
indebted
to
him
for
lodging
and
the
more
he
thought
of
the
idea
the
better
he
liked
it
well
now
you
he
said
with
a
great
assumption
of
cordiality
why
not
come
in
and
a
cup
o
tea
the
other
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
with
a
light
laugh
accepted
the
offer
he
followed
them
into
the
small
and
untidy
back
parlour
and
being
requested
by
his
hostess
to
squeeze
in
next
to
at
the
small
round
table
complied
so
literally
with
the
order
that
that
young
lady
complained
bitterly
of
his
encroachments
and
where
do
you
think
of
sleeping
inquired
kybird
after
his
daughter
had
to
use
her
own
expressive
phrase
shown
the
guest
his
place
nugent
shook
his
head
i
shall
get
a
lodging
somewhere
he
said
airily
there
a
room
upstairs
as
you
might
if
you
liked
said
kybird
slowly
it
been
let
to
a
very
respectable
clean
young
man
for
half
a
crown
a
week
really
it
ought
to
be
three
shillings
but
if
you
like
to
it
at
the
old
price
you
can
done
with
you
said
the
other
no
doubt
you
soon
get
something
to
do
continued
kybird
more
in
answer
to
his
wife
inquiring
glances
than
anything
else
half
a
crown
every
saturday
and
the
room
yours
nugent
thanked
him
and
after
making
a
tea
which
caused
kybird
to
congratulate
himself
upon
the
fact
that
he
had
offered
to
board
him
sat
regaling
kybird
and
daughter
with
a
recital
of
his
adventures
in
australia
receiving
in
return
a
full
and
true
account
of
sunwich
and
its
people
up
to
date
there
no
pride
about
that
what
i
like
said
kybird
to
her
lord
and
master
as
they
sat
alone
after
closing
time
over
a
glass
of
gin
and
water
he
a
nice
young
feller
but
bisness
is
bisness
and
you
do
get
your
rent
i
shall
get
it
sooner
or
later
said
kybird
that
father
of
be
in
a
fine
way
at
living
here
that
wot
i
thinking
of
i
do
see
why
said
kybird
bridling
who
captain
nugent
i
should
like
to
know
we
as
good
as
what
is
if
not
better
and
as
for
the
gell
if
she
got
amelia
looks
she
do
a
gal
assented
kybird
i
wonder
he
laid
his
pipe
down
on
the
table
and
stared
at
the
mantelpiece
he
seems
very
struck
with
he
concluded
i
see
that
directly
not
afore
i
did
said
his
wife
sharply
see
it
afore
you
come
into
the
shop
said
kybird
triumphantly
it
be
a
strange
thing
to
marry
into
that
family
emma
she
keeping
company
with
young
teddy
silk
his
wife
reminded
him
coldly
and
if
she
was
she
could
do
better
than
a
young
man
without
a
penny
in
pocket
pride
a
fine
thing
but
you
ca
live
on
it
i
know
what
i
talking
about
said
kybird
impatiently
i
know
she
keeping
company
with
teddy
as
well
as
wot
you
do
still
as
far
as
money
goes
young
nugent
be
all
right
inquired
his
wife
kybird
hesitated
and
took
a
sip
of
his
gin
and
water
then
he
regarded
the
wife
of
his
bosom
with
a
calculating
glance
which
at
once
excited
that
lady
easily
kindled
wrath
illustration
he
regarded
the
wife
of
his
bosom
with
a
calculating
glance
you
know
i
never
tell
secrets
she
cried
not
often
corrected
kybird
but
then
i
do
often
tell
you
any
wot
would
you
say
to
young
nugent
coming
into
five
pounds
mother
left
when
he
he
do
know
it
but
i
do
five
repeated
his
wife
sure
no
said
the
other
i
not
sure
but
i
know
i
it
from
young
roberts
when
was
at
stone
and
dartnell
five
pounds
i
shall
get
my
money
all
right
some
time
and
if
wants
a
little
bit
to
go
on
with
can
have
it
he
honest
enough
i
can
see
that
by
his
manner
upstairs
in
the
tiny
room
under
the
tiles
jack
nugent
in
blissful
ignorance
of
his
landlord
generous
sentiments
towards
him
slept
the
sound
dreamless
sleep
of
the
man
free
from
monetary
cares
in
the
sanctity
of
her
chamber
miss
kybird
gazing
approvingly
at
the
reflection
of
her
yellow
hair
and
fine
eyes
in
the
little
cracked
was
already
comparing
him
very
favourably
with
the
somewhat
pessimistic
mr
silk
chapter
viii
nugent
return
caused
a
sensation
in
several
quarters
the
feeling
at
equator
lodge
bordering
close
upon
open
mutiny
even
kingdom
plucked
up
spirit
and
read
the
astonished
captain
a
homily
upon
the
first
duties
of
a
parent
a
homily
which
she
backed
up
by
reading
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
through
to
the
bitter
end
at
the
conclusion
she
broke
down
entirely
and
was
led
up
to
bed
by
kate
and
bella
the
sympathy
of
the
latter
taking
an
acute
form
and
consisting
mainly
of
innuendoes
which
could
only
refer
to
one
person
in
the
house
kate
nugent
who
was
not
prone
to
tears
took
a
different
line
but
with
no
better
success
the
captain
declined
to
discuss
the
subject
and
after
listening
to
a
description
of
himself
in
which
nero
and
other
celebrities
figured
for
the
purpose
of
having
their
characters
whitewashed
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
jem
hardy
heard
of
the
new
arrival
from
his
partner
and
ignoring
that
gentleman
urgent
advice
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shone
and
take
master
nugent
for
a
walk
forthwith
sat
thoughtfully
considering
how
to
turn
the
affair
to
the
best
advantage
a
slight
outbreak
of
diphtheria
at
fullalove
alley
had
for
a
time
closed
that
thoroughfare
to
miss
nugent
and
he
was
inclined
to
regard
the
opportune
arrival
of
her
brother
as
an
effort
of
providence
on
his
behalf
for
some
days
however
he
looked
for
jack
nugent
in
vain
that
gentleman
either
being
out
of
doors
engaged
in
an
earnest
search
for
work
or
snugly
seated
in
the
back
parlour
of
the
kybirds
indulging
in
the
somewhat
perilous
pastime
of
paying
compliments
to
amelia
kybird
remittances
which
had
reached
him
from
his
sister
and
aunt
had
been
promptly
returned
and
he
was
indebted
to
the
amiable
kybird
for
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
in
these
circumstances
a
warm
feeling
of
gratitude
towards
the
family
closed
his
eyes
to
their
obvious
shortcomings
he
even
obtained
work
down
at
the
harbour
through
a
friend
of
kybird
it
was
not
of
a
very
exalted
nature
and
caused
more
strain
upon
the
back
than
the
intellect
but
seven
years
of
roughing
it
had
left
him
singularly
free
from
caste
prejudices
a
freedom
which
he
soon
discovered
was
not
shared
by
his
old
acquaintances
at
sunwich
the
discovery
made
him
somewhat
bitter
and
when
hardy
stopped
him
one
afternoon
as
he
was
on
his
way
home
from
work
he
tried
to
ignore
his
outstretched
hand
and
continued
on
his
way
illustration
he
even
obtained
work
down
at
the
harbor
it
is
a
long
time
since
we
met
said
hardy
placing
himself
in
front
of
him
good
heavens
said
jack
regarding
him
closely
it
jemmy
hardy
grown
up
spick
and
span
like
the
industrious
little
boys
in
the
i
heard
you
were
back
here
i
came
back
just
before
you
did
said
hardy
brass
band
playing
you
in
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
suppose
said
the
other
alas
how
the
wicked
prosper
and
you
were
wicked
do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
knock
me
about
come
round
to
my
place
and
have
a
chat
said
hardy
jack
shook
his
head
they
expecting
me
in
to
tea
he
said
with
a
nod
in
the
direction
of
kybird
and
honest
waterside
labourers
who
earn
their
bread
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
when
the
foreman
is
looking
do
not
frequent
the
society
of
the
upper
classes
do
be
a
fool
said
hardy
politely
well
i
not
very
tidy
retorted
nugent
glancing
at
his
clothes
i
do
mind
it
myself
i
a
philosopher
and
nothing
hurts
me
so
long
as
i
have
enough
to
eat
and
drink
but
i
do
inflict
myself
on
my
friends
and
i
must
say
most
of
them
meet
me
more
than
imagination
said
hardy
all
except
kate
and
my
aunt
said
jack
firmly
poor
kate
i
tried
to
cut
her
the
other
day
cut
her
echoed
hardy
nugent
nodded
to
save
her
feelings
he
replied
but
she
would
be
cut
bless
her
and
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
it
was
to
form
a
precedent
i
let
her
kiss
me
behind
a
waggon
do
you
know
i
fancy
she
grown
up
rather
jem
you
are
observant
said
hardy
admiringly
of
course
it
may
be
my
partiality
said
nugent
with
judicial
fairness
i
was
always
a
bit
fond
of
kate
i
do
suppose
anybody
else
would
see
anything
in
her
where
are
you
living
now
fort
road
said
hardy
come
round
any
evening
you
can
if
you
come
now
nugent
promised
and
catching
sight
of
miss
kybird
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
shop
bade
him
and
crossed
the
road
it
was
becoming
quite
a
regular
thing
for
her
to
wait
and
have
her
tea
with
him
now
an
arrangement
which
was
provocative
of
many
sly
remarks
on
the
part
of
kybird
illustration
miss
kybird
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
shop
thought
you
were
never
coming
said
miss
kybird
tartly
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
back
room
and
took
her
seat
at
the
untidy
and
you
been
crying
your
eyes
out
i
suppose
remarked
nugent
as
he
groped
in
the
depths
of
a
tall
jar
for
jam
well
you
not
the
first
and
i
do
suppose
you
be
the
last
teddy
get
your
tea
retorted
miss
kybird
and
do
make
that
scraping
noise
on
the
bottom
of
the
jar
with
your
knife
it
puts
my
teeth
on
edge
so
it
does
mine
said
nugent
but
there
a
black
currant
down
there
and
i
mean
to
have
it
not
want
not
make
him
put
that
knife
down
said
miss
kybird
as
her
mother
entered
the
room
kybird
shook
her
head
at
him
you
two
are
always
quarrelling
she
said
archly
just
like
a
couple
of
couple
of
suggested
nugent
kybird
in
great
glee
squeezed
round
to
him
and
smote
him
playfully
with
her
large
fat
hand
and
then
being
somewhat
out
of
breath
with
the
exertion
sat
down
to
enjoy
the
jest
in
comfort
that
how
you
encourage
him
said
her
daughter
no
wonder
he
behave
no
wonder
he
acts
as
if
the
whole
place
belongs
to
him
the
remark
was
certainly
descriptive
of
nugent
behaviour
his
easy
assurance
and
affability
had
already
made
him
a
prime
favourite
with
kybird
and
had
not
been
without
its
effect
upon
her
daughter
the
constrained
and
severe
company
manners
of
edward
silk
showed
up
but
poorly
beside
those
of
the
paying
guest
and
miss
kybird
had
on
several
occasions
drawn
comparisons
which
would
have
rendered
both
gentlemen
uneasy
if
they
had
known
of
them
nugent
carried
the
same
easy
with
him
the
following
week
when
neatly
attired
in
a
suit
from
extensive
stock
he
paid
a
visit
to
jem
hardy
to
talk
over
old
times
and
discuss
the
future
you
ought
to
make
friends
with
your
father
said
the
latter
it
only
wants
a
little
common
sense
and
mutual
forbearance
that
all
said
nugent
sounds
easy
enough
does
it
no
all
he
wants
is
for
me
to
clear
out
of
sunwich
and
i
not
going
to
until
it
pleases
me
at
any
rate
it
poison
to
him
for
me
to
be
living
at
the
kybirds
and
pushing
a
trolley
down
on
the
quay
talk
about
love
sweetening
toil
that
does
hardy
changed
the
subject
and
nugent
nothing
loath
discoursed
on
his
wanderings
and
took
him
on
a
personally
conducted
tour
through
the
continent
of
australia
and
i
come
back
to
lay
my
bones
in
sunwich
churchyard
he
concluded
pathetically
that
is
when
i
done
with
a
lot
of
things
happen
before
then
said
hardy
i
hope
so
rejoined
nugent
piously
my
desire
is
to
be
buried
by
my
weeping
in
fact
i
left
instructions
to
that
effect
in
my
will
all
i
have
left
by
the
way
you
not
going
to
keep
on
at
this
work
i
suppose
said
hardy
making
another
effort
to
give
the
conversation
a
serious
turn
the
foreman
does
think
so
replied
the
other
as
he
helped
himself
to
some
whisky
he
has
made
several
remarks
to
that
effect
lately
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
thoughtfully
by
no
means
insensible
to
the
comfort
of
his
surroundings
he
had
not
been
in
such
comfortable
quarters
since
he
left
home
seven
years
before
he
thought
of
the
untidy
litter
of
the
kybirds
back
parlour
with
the
forlorn
view
of
the
yard
in
the
rear
something
of
his
reflections
he
confided
to
hardy
as
he
rose
to
leave
but
my
market
value
is
about
a
pound
a
week
he
concluded
ruefully
so
i
must
cut
my
coat
to
suit
my
cloth
he
walked
home
somewhat
soberly
at
first
but
the
air
was
cool
and
fresh
and
a
glorious
moon
was
riding
in
the
sky
he
whistled
cheerfully
and
his
spirits
rose
as
various
chimerical
plans
of
making
money
occurred
to
him
by
the
time
he
reached
the
high
street
the
shops
of
which
were
all
closed
for
the
night
he
was
earning
five
hundred
a
year
and
spending
a
thousand
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
walking
in
discovered
miss
kybird
entertaining
company
in
the
person
of
edward
silk
halloa
he
said
airily
as
he
took
a
seat
do
mind
me
young
people
go
on
just
as
you
would
if
i
were
not
here
edward
silk
grumbled
something
under
his
breath
miss
kybird
turning
to
the
intruder
with
a
smile
of
welcome
remarked
that
she
had
just
thought
of
going
to
sleep
going
to
sleep
repeated
mr
silk
yes
said
miss
kybird
yawning
mr
silk
gazed
at
her
what
with
me
he
inquired
in
trembling
tones
you
not
very
lively
company
said
miss
kybird
bending
over
her
sewing
i
do
think
you
spoken
a
word
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
and
before
that
you
were
talking
of
made
my
flesh
creep
you
did
shame
said
nugent
you
did
say
anything
to
me
about
your
flesh
creeping
muttered
mr
silk
you
ought
to
have
seen
it
creep
interposed
nugent
severely
i
not
talking
to
you
said
mr
silk
turning
on
him
when
i
want
the
favour
of
remarks
from
you
i
let
you
know
do
you
talk
to
my
gentlemen
friends
like
that
teddy
said
miss
kybird
sharply
because
i
wo
have
it
why
do
you
try
and
be
bright
and
cheerful
like
mr
nugent
mr
silk
turned
and
regarded
that
gentleman
steadfastly
nugent
meeting
his
gaze
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
a
offer
to
give
him
lessons
at
half
a
crown
an
hour
i
would
be
like
for
worlds
said
mr
silk
with
a
scornful
laugh
i
sooner
be
like
anybody
what
have
you
been
saying
to
him
inquired
nugent
nothing
replied
miss
kybird
he
often
like
that
he
got
a
nasty
miserable
jealous
disposition
not
that
i
mind
what
he
thinks
mr
silk
breathed
hard
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
perhaps
he
grow
out
of
it
said
nugent
hopefully
cheer
up
teddy
you
young
yet
might
i
arsk
said
the
solemnly
enraged
mr
silk
might
i
arsk
you
not
to
be
so
free
with
my
christian
name
he
does
like
his
name
now
said
nugent
drawing
his
chair
closer
to
miss
kybird
and
i
do
wonder
at
it
what
shall
we
call
him
job
what
that
work
you
doing
why
do
you
get
on
with
that
fancy
waistcoat
you
are
doing
for
me
before
miss
kybird
could
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
article
in
question
her
sorely
tried
swain
created
a
diversion
by
rising
to
that
simple
act
he
imparted
an
emphasis
which
commanded
the
attention
of
both
beholders
and
drawing
over
to
miss
kybird
he
stood
over
her
in
an
attitude
at
once
terrifying
and
reproachful
take
your
choice
amelia
he
said
in
a
thrilling
voice
me
or
which
is
it
to
be
illustration
me
or
which
is
it
to
be
here
steady
old
man
cried
the
startled
nugent
go
easy
me
or
repeated
mr
silk
in
stern
but
broken
accents
miss
kybird
giggled
and
avoiding
his
gaze
looked
pensively
at
the
faded
hearthrug
you
making
her
blush
said
nugent
sternly
sit
down
teddy
i
ashamed

you

you
you
confusing
us
dreadfully
proposing
to
us
both
in
this
way
mr
silk
regarded
him
with
a
scornful
eye
but
miss
kybird
bidding
him
not
to
be
foolish
punctuated
her
remarks
with
the
needle
and
a
struggle
which
mr
silk
regarded
as
unseemly
in
the
highest
degree
took
place
between
them
for
its
possession
nugent
secured
it
at
last
and
brandishing
it
fiercely
extorted
feminine
screams
from
miss
kybird
by
threatening
her
with
it
nor
was
her
mind
relieved
until
nugent
remarking
that
he
would
put
it
back
in
the
pincushion
placed
it
in
the
leg
of
edward
silk
kybird
and
his
wife
entering
through
the
shop
were
just
in
time
to
witness
a
spirited
performance
on
the
part
of
mr
silk
the
cherished
purpose
of
which
was
to
deprive
them
of
a
lodger
he
drew
back
as
they
entered
and
raising
his
voice
above
miss
kybird
began
to
explain
his
action
teddy
i
ashamed
of
you
said
kybird
shaking
his
head
a
little
joke
like
that
a
little
innercent
joke
if
it
been
a
now
began
kybird
all
right
said
the
desperate
mr
silk
it
your
own
way
let
marry
i
do
care
give
up
teddy
said
kybird
in
a
shocked
voice
teddy
mr
silk
thrust
him
fiercely
to
one
side
and
passed
raging
through
the
shop
the
sound
of
articles
falling
in
all
directions
attested
to
his
blind
haste
and
the
force
with
which
he
slammed
the
was
sufficient
evidence
of
his
state
of
mind
well
upon
my
word
said
the
staring
kybird
of
all
the
outrageyous
never
mind
said
his
wife
who
was
sitting
in
the
easy
chair
distributing
affectionate
smiles
between
her
daughter
and
the
startled
nugent
make
happy
jack
that
all
i
arsk
she
been
a
good
gal
and
she
make
a
good
wife
i
seen
how
it
was
between
you
for
some
time
so
i
said
kybird
he
shook
hands
warmly
with
nugent
and
patting
that
perturbed
man
on
the
back
surveyed
him
with
eyes
glistening
with
approval
it
a
bit
rough
on
teddy
is
it
inquired
nugent
anxiously
besides
do
you
worry
about
said
kybird
affectionately
he
worth
it
i
was
said
nugent
truthfully
the
situation
had
developed
so
rapidly
that
it
had
caught
him
at
a
disadvantage
he
had
a
dim
feeling
that
having
been
the
cause
of
miss
kybird
losing
one
young
man
the
most
elementary
notions
of
chivalry
demanded
that
he
should
furnish
her
with
another
and
this
idea
was
clearly
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
her
parents
he
looked
over
at
amelia
and
with
characteristic
philosophy
accepted
the
position
we
shall
be
the
handsomest
couple
in
sunwich
he
said
simply
bar
none
said
kybird
emphatically
the
stout
lady
in
the
chair
gazed
ax
the
couple
fondly
it
reminds
me
of
our
wedding
she
said
softly
what
was
it
tom
fletcher
said
father
can
you
remember
smith

corrected
kybird
tom
fletcher
said
something
i
sure
persisted
his
wife
he
did
said
kybird
grimly
and
i
pretty
near
broke
for
it
smith
is
the
one
you
thinking
of
kybird
after
a
moment
reflection
admitted
that
he
was
right
and
the
chain
of
memory
being
touched
waxed
discursive
about
her
own
wedding
and
the
somewhat
exciting
details
which
accompanied
it
after
which
she
produced
a
bottle
labelled
port
wine
from
the
cupboard
and
filling
four
glasses
celebrated
the
occasion
in
a
befitting
but
sober
fashion
this
said
nugent
as
he
sat
on
his
bed
that
night
to
take
his
boots
off
this
is
what
comes
of
trying
to
make
everybody

comfortable
with
a
little

the
news
of

only
son
engagement
took
captain
nugent
breath
away
which
all
things
considered
was
perhaps
the
best
thing
it
could
have
done
he
sat
at
home
in
silent
rage
only
exploding
when
the
kingdom
sought
to
minimize
his
troubles
by
comparing
them
with
those
of

her
reminder
that
to
the
best
of
her
remembrance
he
had
never
had
a
boil
in
his
life
put
the
finishing
touch
to
his
patience
and
despairing
of
synonyms
for
the
words
which
trembled
on
his
lips
he
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
to
the
garden
his
son
bore
his
new
honours
bravely
to
an
appealing
and
indignant
letter
from
his
sister
he
wrote
gravely
reminding
her
of
the
difference
in
their
years
and
also
that
he
had
never
interfered
in
her
flirtations
however
sorely
his
brotherly
heart
might
have
been
wrung
by
them
he
urged
her
to
forsake
such
diversions
for
the
future
and
to
look
for
an
alliance
with
some
noble
man
with
a
large
banking
account
and
a
fondness
for
his
wife
relatives
to
jem
hardy
who
ventured
on
a
delicate
one
evening
he
was
less
patient
and
displayed
a
newly
acquired
dignity
which
was
a
source
of
considerable
embarrassment
to
that
gentleman
he
even
got
up
to
search
for
his
hat
and
was
only
induced
to
resume
his
seat
by
the
physical
exertions
of
his
host
i
did
mean
to
be
offensive
said
the
latter
but
you
were
said
the
aggrieved
man
hardy
apologized
talk
of
that
kind
is
a
slight
to
my
future
wife
said
nugent
firmly
besides
what
business
is
it
of
yours
hardy
regarded
him
thoughtfully
it
was
some
time
since
he
had
seen
miss
nugent
and
he
felt
that
he
was
losing
valuable
time
he
had
hoped
great
things
from
the
advent
of
her
brother
and
now
his
intimacy
seemed
worse
than
useless
he
resolved
to
take
him
into
his
confidence
i
spoke
from
selfish
motives
he
said
at
last
i
wanted
you
to
make
friends
with
your
father
again
what
for
inquired
the
other
staring
to
pave
the
way
for
me
said
hardy
raising
his
voice
as
he
thought
of
his
wrongs
and
now
owing
to
your
confounded
matrimonial
business
that
all
knocked
on
the
head
i
would
care
whom
you
married
if
it
did
interfere
with
my
affairs
so
do
you
mean
inquired
the
astonished
nugent
that
you
want
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
my
father
yes
nugent
gazed
at
him
you
have
had
a
blow
on
the
head
or
anything
of
that
sort
at
any
time
have
you
he
inquired
hardy
shook
his
head
impatiently
you
do
seem
to
suffer
from
an
excess
of
intellect
yourself
he
retorted
i
do
want
to
be
offensive
again
still
i
should
think
it
is
pretty
plain
there
is
only
one
reason
why
i
should
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
the
society
of
your
father
say
what
you
like
about
my
intellect
replied
the
dutiful
son
but
i
ca
think
of
even
one
not
even
a
small
one
not
good
gracious
you
do
mean
you
ca
mean
hardy
looked
at
him
not
that
said
nugent
whose
intellect
had
suddenly
become
painfully
acute
not
her
why
not
inquired
the
other
nugent
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
him
with
an
air
of
kindly
interest
well
there
no
need
for
you
to
worry
about
my
father
for
that
he
said
he
would
raise
no
objection
eh
said
hardy
starting
up
from
his
chair
he
would
welcome
it
said
nugent
positively
there
is
nothing
that
he
would
like
better
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
a
secret
she
likes
you
hardy
reddened
how
do
you
know
he
stammered
i
know
it
for
a
fact
said
the
other
impressively
i
have
heard
her
say
so
but
you
been
very
about
me
jem
so
that
i
shall
say
what
i
think
do
said
his
bewildered
friend
i
think
you
be
throwing
yourself
away
said
nugent
to
my
mind
a
most
unsuitable
match
in
every
way
she
got
no
money
no
looks
no
style
nothing
but
a
good
kind
heart
rather
the
worse
for
wear
i
suppose
you
know
she
been
married
once
shouted
the
other
nugent
nodded
his
face
was
perfectly
grave
but
the
joke
was
beginning
to
prey
upon
his
vitals
in
a
manner
which
brooked
no
delay
i
thought
everybody
knew
it
he
said
we
have
never
disguised
the
fact
her
husband
died
twenty
years
ago
last
twenty
said
his
suddenly
enlightened
listener
who
what
nugent
incapable
of
reply
put
his
head
on
the
table
and
beat
the
air
frantically
with
his
hand
while
gasping
sobs
rent
his
tortured
frame
dear
aunt
he
choked
how
pleas
pleased
she
be
if
she
knew
do
look
like
that
hardy
you
kill
me
you
seem
amused
said
hardy
between
his
teeth
and
you
be
kate
uncle
said
nugent
sitting
up
and
wiping
his
eyes
poor
little
kate
he
put
his
head
on
the
table
again
and
mine
he
wailed
jemmy
will
you
tip
us
nunky
hardy
expression
of
lofty
scorn
only
served
to
retard
his
recovery
but
he
sat
up
at
last
and
giving
his
eyes
a
final
wipe
beamed
kindly
upon
his
victim
well
i
do
what
i
can
for
you
he
observed
but
i
suppose
you
know
kate
off
for
a
three
months
visit
to
london
the
other
observed
that
he
did
know
it
and
taught
by
his
recent
experience
eyed
him
suspiciously
it
quite
true
said
nugent
she
going
to
stay
with
some
relatives
of
ours
she
used
to
be
very
fond
of
one
of
the
boys
her
cousin
herbert
so
you
must
be
surprised
if
she
comes
back
engaged
but
i
daresay
you
have
forgotten
all
about
her
in
three
months
and
anyway
i
do
suppose
she
look
at
you
if
you
were
the
last
man
in
the
world
if
you
walk
part
of
the
way
home
with
me
i
regale
you
with
anecdotes
of
her
chilhood
which
will
probably
cause
you
to
change
your
views

edward

his
forebodings
fulfilled
received
the
news
of
amelia
kybird
faithlessness
in
a
spirit
of
quiet
despair
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
voluble
sympathy
of
his
neighbours
similar
things
had
happened
to
young
men
living
there
before
but
their
behaviour
had
been
widely
different
to
mr
silk
bob
crump
for
instance
had
been
jilted
on
the
very
morning
he
had
arranged
for
his
wedding
but
instead
of
going
about
in
a
state
of
gentle
melancholy
he
went
round
and
fought
his
beloved
father
merely
because
it
was
her
father
and
wound
up
an
exciting
day
by
selling
off
his
household
goods
to
the
highest
bidders
henry
jones
in
similar
circumstances
relieved
his
great
grief
by
walking
up
and
down
the
alley
smashing
every
window
within
reach
of
his
stick
illustration
a
spirit
of
quiet
despair
but
these
were
men
of
spirit
mr
silk
was
cast
in
a
different
mould
and
his
fair
neighbours
sympathized
heartily
with
him
in
his
bereavement
while
utterly
failing
to
understand
any
man
breaking
his
heart
over
amelia
kybird
his
mother
a
widow
of
uncertain
age
shook
her
head
over
him
and
hinted
darkly
at
consumption
an
idea
which
was
very
pleasing
to
her
son
and
gave
him
an
increased
interest
in
a
slight
cold
from
which
he
was
suffering

had
stepped
across
the

young
days
one
time
i
a
fresh
gal
every
mrs

sniffed
and
looked
up
the
alley
whereat
two
neighbours
who
happened
to
be
at
their
doors
glanced
up
and
down
casually
and
retreated
inside
to
continue
their
vigil
from
the
windows
silk
courted
me
for
fifteen
years
before
i
would
say
she
said
severely
fifteen
years
responded
the
other
he
cast
his
eyes
upwards
and
his
lips
twitched
the
most
casual
observer
could
have
seen
that
he
was
engaged
in
calculations
of
an
abstruse
and
elusive
nature
i
was
seven
when
started
said
mrs
silk
sharply
wilks
brought
his
eyes
to
a
level
again
oh
seven
he
remarked
and
we
was
married
two
days
before
my
nineteenth
birthday
added
mrs
silk
whose
own
arithmetic
had
always
been
her
weak
point
just
so
said
wilks
he
glanced
at
the
sharp
white
face
and
shapeless
figure
before
him
it
hard
to
believe

he
added
gallantly
it
makes
you
feel
as
if

on
said
the
widow
the
agreed
and
after
standing
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
made
a
preliminary
motion
of
withdrawal
beautiful
your
plants
are
looking
said
mrs
silk
glancing
over
at
his
window
i
ca
think
what
you
do
to
the
gratified
wilks
began
to
explain
it
appeared
that
plants
wanted
almost
as
much
looking
after
as
daughters
i
should
like
to
see
close
said
mrs
silk
come
in
and
a
look
at
responded
her
neighbour
mrs
silk
hesitated
and
displayed
a
maidenly
coyness
far
in
excess
of
the
needs
of
the
situation
then
she
stepped
across
and
five
seconds
later
the
two
matrons
with
consternation
writ
large
upon
their
faces
appeared
at
their
doors
again
and
exchanging
glances
across
the
alley
met
in
the
centre
they
were
more
surprised
an
evening
or
two
later
to
see
wilks
leave
his
house
to
pay
a
return
visit
bearing
in
his
hand
a
small
bunch
of
his
cherished
blooms
that
they
were
blooms
which
would
have
paid
the
debt
of
nature
in
a
few
hours
at
most
in
no
way
detracted
from
the
expressions
of
pleasure
at
receiving
them
and
wilks
who
had
been
invited
over
to
cheer
up
mr
silk
who
was
in
a
particularly
black
mood
sat
and
smiled
like
a
detected
philanthropist
as
she
placed
them
in

return
visit

he
said
breezily
with
a
at
his
hostess
what
a
lovely
day
we
so
bright
said
mrs
silk
nodding
with
spirit
wilks
sat
down
and
gave
vent
to
such
a
cheerful
laugh
that
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
shook
with
it
it
good
to
be
alive
he
declared
ah
you
enjoy
your
life
wilks
said
the
widow
enjoy
it
roared
wilks
enjoy
it
why
should
i
why
everybody
enjoy
their
lives
it
was
what
they
was
given
to
us
for
so
they
was
affirmed
mrs
silk
nobody
can
deny
that
not
if
they
try
nobody
wants
to
deny
it
retorted
wilks
in
the
high
voice
he
kept
for
purposes
i
enjoy
every
day
o
my
life
he
filled
his
pipe
chuckling
serenely
and
having
lit
it
sat
and
enjoyed
that
mrs
silk
retired
for
a
space
and
returning
with
a
jug
of
ale
poured
him
out
a
glass
and
set
it
by
his
elbow
here
your
good
said
wilks
raising
it
yours
teddy
a
long
life
and
a
one
mr
silk
turned
listlessly
i
do
want
a
long
life
he
remarked
his
mother
and
her
visitor
exchanged
glances
that
goes
on
remarked
the
former
in
an
audible
whisper
wilks
nodded
reassuringly
i
them
ideas
once
he
said
but
they
go
off
if
you
could
only
live
to
see
teddy
at
the
age
o
would
want
to
go
then
say
it
was
crool
hard
being
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
youth
mrs
silk
laughed
gaily
and
wilks
bellowed
a
gruff
accompaniment
edward
silk
eyed
them
pityingly
that
the
of
it
he
said
slowly
as
he
looked
round
from
his
seat
by
the
fireplace
that
where
the
of
things
comes
in
that
where
i
envy
mr
wilks
envy
me
said
the
smiling
visitor
what
for
because
you
so
near
the
grave
said
mr
silk
wilks
who
was
taking
another
draught
of
beer
put
the
glass
down
and
eyed
him
fixedly
that
why
i
envy
you
continued
the
other
i
do
want

live
and
you
do
and
yet
i
dessay

about
forty
and
fifty
years
after
you

and

the
grave
inquired
wilks
somewhat
shortly
i
was
referring
to
your
age
replied
the
other
it
strange
to
see
the
aged
on
to
life
you

look

all

gone
pursued
mr

and
they
beckoning
to
you
let
beckon
said
wilks
coldly
i
not
going
yet
you
not
young
said
mr
silk
gazing
meditatively
at
the
grate
and
i
envy
you
that
it
can
only
be
a
matter
of
a
year
or
two
at
most
before
you
are
sleeping
your
last
long
sleep
teddy
protested
mrs
silk
it
true
mother
said
the
melancholy
youth
wilks
is
old
why
should
mind
being
told
of
it
if
had
the
trouble
i
be
glad
to
go
but
he
to
go
whether
likes
it
or
not
it
might
be
who
can
tell
wilks
unasked
poured
himself
out
another
glass
of
ale
and
drank
it
off
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
intended
to
make
sure
of
that
it
seemed
a
trifle
more
flat
than
the
last
so
many
men
o
your
age
and
thereabouts
continued
mr
silk
think
that
they
going
to
live
on
to
eighty
or
ninety
but
there
very
few
of
do
it
only
a
short
while
wilks
and
the
little
children
be
running
about
over
your
grave
and
picking
daisies
off
of
it
ho
will
they
said
the
irritated
wilks
they
better
not
let
me
catch
at
it
that
all
he
always
talking
like
that
now
said
mrs
silk
not
without
a
certain
pride
in
her
tones
that
why
i
asked
you
in
to
cheer
up
all
your
troubles
be
over
then
continued
the
warning
voice
and
in
a
month
or
two
even
your
name
be
forgotten
that
the
way
of
the
world
think
soon
the
last
five
years
of
your

mrs
silk
in

wilks
nodded
and
despite
his
hostess
protests
rose
to
go
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
after
a
short
but
sharp
inward
struggle
shook
hands
with
her
son
it
was
late
in
the
evening
as
he
left
but
the
houses
had
not
yet
been
lit
up
dim
figures
sat
in
doorways
or
stood
about
the
alley
and
there
was
an
air
of
peace
and
rest
strangely
and
uncomfortably
in
keeping
with
the
conversation
to
which
he
had
just
been
listening
he
looked
in
at
his
own
door
the
furniture
seemed
stiffer
than
usual
and
the
tick
of
the
clock
more
deliberate
he
closed
the
door
again
and
taking
a
deep
breath
set
off
towards
the
life

bustle
of

concerning

all

strictly
forbidden

he
was
favoured
with
a
glimpse
of

because

the
finishing
touch
to
his
patience
was
supplied
by
a
little
misunderstanding
between
kybird
and
the
police
for
the
second
time
in
his
career
the
shopkeeper
appeared
before
the
magistrates
to
explain
the

in
which
he
had
purchased
stolen
property
and
for
the

left

gave
evidence
in

and
some
of
his
replies
were
deemed
worthy

for

design
of
confining
him
in
an
asylum
for
the
mentally
afflicted
until
such
time
as
he
should
have
regained
his
senses
was
spoilt
by
the
refusal
of
murchison

arrange
for
the

was

been
fraught
with

family
brooding
over
his

the
captain
a
day
or
two
after
his
return
strolled
slowly
down
towards
the
harbour
it
was
afternoon
and
the
short
winter
day
was
already
drawing
towards
a
close
the
shipping
looked
cold
and
desolate
in
the
greyness
but
a
bustle
of
work
prevailed
on
the
conqueror
which
was
nearly
ready
for
sea
again
the
gaze
wandered
from
his
old
craft
to
the
small
vessels
dotted
about
the
harbour
and
finally
dwelt
admiringly
on
the
lines
of
the
whaler
seabird
which
had
put
in
a
few
days
before
as
the
result
of
a
slight
collision
with
a
she
was
high
out
of
the
water
and
beautifully
rigged
a
dog
ran
up
and
down
her
decks
barking
and
a
couple
of
squat
figures
leaned
over
the
bulwarks
gazing
stolidly
ashore
there
was
something
about
the
vessel
which
took
his
fancy
and
he
stood
for
some
time
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
looking
at
her
in
a
day
or
two
she
would
sail
for
a
voyage
the
length
of
which
would
depend
upon
her
success
a
voyage
which
would
for
a
long
period
keep
all
on
board
of
her
out
of
the
mischief
which
so
easily
happens
ashore
if
only
jack
he
started
and
stared
more
intently
than
before
he
was
not
an
imaginative
man
but
he
had
in
his
mind
eye
a
sudden
vision
of
his
only
son
waving
farewells
from
the
deck
of
the
whaler
as
she
emerged
from
the
harbour
into
the
open
sea
while
amelia
kybird
tore
her
yellow
locks
ashore
it
was
a
vision
to
cheer
any
father
heart
and
he
brought
his
mind
back
with
some
regret
to
the
reality
of
the
anchored
ship
he
walked
home
slowly
at
the
kybirds
door
the
proprietor
smoking
a
short
clay
pipe
eyed
him
with
furtive
glee
as
he
passed
farther
along
the
road
the
hardys
father
and
son
stepped
briskly
together
altogether
a
trying
walk
and
calculated
to
make
him
more
dissatisfied
than
ever
with
the
present
state
of
affairs
when
his
daughter
shook
her
head
at
him
and
accused
him
of
going
off
on
a
solitary
frolic
his
stock
of
patience
gave
out
entirely
illustration
the
proprietor
eyed
him
with
furtive
glee
as
he
passed
a
thoughtful
night
led
to
a
visit
to
wilks
the
following
evening
it
required
a
great
deal
of
deliberation
on
his
part
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
the
step
but
he
needed
his
old
steward
assistance
in
a
little
plan
he
had
conceived
for
his
son
benefit
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
paid
him
the
supreme
honour
of
a
call
the
honour
was
so
unexpected
that
wilks
coming
into
the
parlour
in
response
to
the
tapping
of
the
captain
stick
on
the
floor
stood
for
a
short
time
eyeing
him
in
dismay
only
two
minutes
before
he
had
taken
james
hardy
into
the
kitchen
to
point
out
the
interior
beauties
of
an
ancient
clock
and
the
situation
simply
appalled
him
the
captain
greeted
him
almost
politely
and
bade
him
sit
down
wilks
smiled
faintly
and
caught
his
breath
sit
down
repeated
the
captain
i
left
something
in
the
kitchen
sir
said
wilks
i
be
back
in
half
a
minute
the
captain
nodded
in
the
kitchen
wilks
rapidly
and
incoherently
explained
the
situation
to
hardy
i
sit
here
said
the
latter
drawing
up
a
comfortable
oak
chair
to
the
stove
you
see
he
do
know
that
we
know
each
other
explained
the
apologetic
steward
but
i
do
like
leaving
you
in
the
kitchen
i
all
right
said
hardy
do
you
trouble
about
me
he
waved
him
away
and
wilks
still
pale
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
rejoining
the
captain
sat
down
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
chair
and
waited
i
come
to
see
you
on
a
little
matter
of
business
said
his
visitor
wilks
smiled
then
feeling
that
perhaps
that
was
not
quite
the
right
thing
to
do
looked
serious
again
i
came
to
see
you
about
my
my
son
continued
the
captain
yes
sir
said
wilks
master
jack
you
mean
i
only
got
one
son
said
the
other
unpleasantly
unless
you
happen
to
know
of
any
more
wilks
almost
fell
off
the
edge
of
the
chair
in
his
haste
to
disclaim
any
such
knowledge
his
ideas
were
in
a
ferment
and
the
guilty
knowledge
of
what
he
had
left
in
the
kitchen
added
to
his
confusion
and
just
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
miss
nugent
came
briskly
in
her
surprise
at
seeing
her
father
ensconced
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
led
to
a
rapid
volley
of
questions
the
captain
in
lieu
of
answering
them
asked
another
what
do
you
want
here
i
have
come
to
see
sam
said
miss
nugent
fancy
seeing
you
here
how
are
you
sam
pretty
well
miss
replied
wilks
considering
he
added
truthfully
after
a
moment
reflection
miss
nugent
dropped
into
a
chair
and
put
her
feet
on
the
fender
her
father
eyed
her
restlessly
i
came
here
to
speak
to
sam
about
a
private
matter
he
said
abruptly
private
matter
said
his
daughter
looking
round
in
surprise
what
about
a
private
matter
repeated
captain
nugent
suppose
you
come
in
some
other
time
kate
nugent
sighed
and
took
her
feet
from
the
fender
i
go
and
wait
in
the
kitchen
she
said
crossing
to
the
door
both
men
protested
the
captain
because
it
with
his
dignity
for
his
daughter
to
sit
in
the
kitchen
and
wilks
because
of
the
visitor
already
there
the
face
of
the
steward
indeed
took
on
such
extraordinary
expressions
in
his
endeavour
to
convey
private
information
to
the
girl
that
she
gazed
at
him
in
silent
amazement
then
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
passing
through
closed
it
with
a
bang
which
was
final
wilks
stood
spellbound
but
nothing
happened
there
was
no
cry
of
surprise
no
hasty
reappearance
of
an
indignant
kate
nugent
his
features
working
nervously
he
resumed
his
seat
and
gazed
dutifully
at
his
superior
officer
i
suppose
you
heard
that
my
son
is
going
to
get
married
said
the
latter
i
could
help
hearing
of
it
sir
said
the
steward
in
self
defence
nobody
could
he
going
to
marry
that
jezebel
of
kybird
said
the
captain
staring
at
the
fire
wilks
murmured
that
he
could
understand
anybody
liking
yellow
hair
and
more
than
that
the
general
opinion
of
the
ladies
in
fullalove
alley
was
that
it
was
dyed
i
going
to
ship
him
on
the
seabird
continued
the
captain
probably
be
away
for
a
year
or
two
and
in
the
meantime
this
girl
will
probably
marry
somebody
else
especially
if
she
does
know
what
has
become
of
him
he
ca
get
into
mischief
aboard
ship
no
sir
said
the
wondering
wilks
is
master
jack
agreeable
to
going
sir
that
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
the
captain
sharply
no
sir
said
wilks
o
course
not
i
was
only
a
sort
wondering
how
he
was
going
to
be
persuaded
to
go
if
ai
that
what
i
came
here
about
said
the
other
i
want
you
to
go
and
fix
it
up
with
nathan
smith
do
you
want
to
be
sir
stammered
wilks
i
want
him
shipped
aboard
the
returned
the
other
and
smith
the
man
to
do
it
it
a
very
hard
thing
to
do
in
these
days
sir
said
wilks
shaking
his
head
what
with
signing
on
aboard
the
day
before
the
ship
sails
and
before
the
board
o
trade
officers
i
sure
it
a
wonder
that
anybody
goes
to
sea
at
all
you
leave
that
to
smith
said
the
captain
impatiently
the
seabird
sails
on
friday
morning
tide
tell
smith
i
arrange
to
meet
my
son
here
on
thursday
night
and
that
he
must
have
some
liquor
for
us
and
a
fly
waiting
on
the
beach
wilks
wriggled
but
what
about
signing
on
sir
he
inquired
he
wo
sign
on
said
the
captain
he
be
a
stowaway
smith
must
get
him
smuggled
aboard
and
bribe
the
hands
to
let
him
lie
hidden
in
the
the
seabird
wo
put
back
to
put
him
ashore
here
is
five
pounds
give
smith
two
or
three
now
and
the
remainder
when
the
job
is
done
the
steward
took
the
money
reluctantly
and
plucking
up
his
courage
looked
his
old
master
in
the
face
it
a
life
afore
the
mast
sir
he
said
slowly
rubbish
was
the
reply
it
make
a
man
of
him
besides
what
it
got
to
do
with
you
i
do
care
about
the
job
sir
said
wilks
bravely
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
demanded
the
other
frowning
you
go
and
fix
it
up
with
nathan
smith
as
soon
as
possible
wilks
shuffled
his
feet
and
strove
to
remind
himself
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
independent
means
and
could
please
himself
i
known
since
he
was
a
baby
he
murmured
defiantly
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
more
from
you
wilks
said
the
captain
in
a
hard
voice
those
are
my
orders
and
you
had
better
see
that
they
are
carried
out
my
son
will
be
one
of
the
first
to
thank
you
later
on
for
getting
him
out
of
such
a
mess
wilks
brow
cleared
somewhat
i
miss
kate
be
pleased
too
he
remarked
of
course
she
will
said
the
captain
now
i
look
to
you
wilks
to
manage
this
thing
properly
i
would
trust
anybody
else
and
never
disappointed
me
yet
the
steward
gasped
and
doubting
whether
he
had
heard
aright
looked
towards
his
old
master
but
in
vain
for
the
confirmation
of
further
compliments
in
all
his
long
years
of
service
he
had
never
been
praised
by
him
before
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
and
began
to
discuss
ways
and
means
in
the
next
room
conversation
was
also
proceeding
but
fitfully
miss
nugent
consternation
when
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
hardy
was
difficult
of
concealment
too
late
she
understood
the
facial
contortions
of
wilks
and
resigning
herself
to
the
inevitable
accepted
the
chair
placed
for
her
by
the
highly
pleased
jem
and
sat
regarding
him
calmly
from
the
other
side
of
the
fender
illustration
miss
nugent
consternation
was
difficult
of
concealment
i
am
waiting
here
for
my
father
she
said
in
explanation
in
deference
to
wilks
terrors
i
am
waiting
here
until
he
has
gone
said
hardy
with
a
half
smile
there
was
a
pause
i
hope
that
he
will
not
be
long
said
the
girl
thank
you
returned
hardy
wilfully
misunderstanding
but
i
am
in
no
hurry
he
gazed
at
her
with
admiration
the
cold
air
had
heightened
her
colour
and
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
shamed
the
solitary
candle
which
lit
up
the
array
of
burnished
metal
on
the
mantelpiece
i
hope
you
enjoyed
your
visit
to
london
he
said
before
replying
miss
nugent
favoured
him
with
a
glance
designed
to
express
surprise
at
least
at
his
knowledge
of
her
movements
very
much
thank
you
she
said
at
last
hardy
still
looking
at
her
with
much
comfort
to
himself
felt
an
insane
desire
to
tell
her
how
much
she
had
been
missed
by
one
person
at
least
in
sunwich
saved
from
this
suicidal
folly
by
the
little
common
sense
which
had
survived
the
shock
of
her
sudden
appearance
he
gave
the
information
indirectly
quite
a
long
stay
he
murmured
three
months
and
three
days
no
three
months
and
two
days
a
sudden
wave
of
colour
swept
over
the
girl
face
at
the
ingenuity
of
this
mode
of
attack
she
was
used
to
attention
and
took
compliments
as
her
due
but
the
significant
audacity
of
this
one
baffled
her
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
looking
at
the
fender
occasionally
glancing
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
to
see
whether
he
was
preparing
to
renew
the
assault
he
had
certainly
changed
from
the
jem
hardy
of
olden
days
she
had
a
faint
idea
that
his
taste
had
improved
wilks
keeps
his
house
in
good
order
said
hardy
looking
round
yes
said
the
girl
wonder
why
he
never
married
said
hardy
musingly
for
my
part
i
understand
a
man
remaining
single
all
his
life
can
you
i
never
think
of
such
things
said
miss
nugent
coldly
and
untruthfully
if
it
was
only
to
have
somebody
to
wait
on
him
and
keep
his
house
clean
pursued
hardy
with
malice
miss
nugent
grew
restless
and
the
wrongs
of
her
sex
stirred
within
her
you
have
very
lofty
ideas
on
the
subject
she
said
scornfully
but
i
believe
they
are
not
uncommon
still
you
have
never
thought
about
such
things
you
know
he
reminded
her
and
no
doubt
you
have
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
to
the
subject
hardy
admitted
it
frankly
but
only
since
i
returned
to
sunwich
he
said
caused
by
the
spectacle
of
sam
forlorn
condition
i
suppose
said
miss
nugent
no
it
was
that
he
replied
miss
nugent
indignant
at
having
been
drawn
into
such
a
discussion
lapsed
into
silence
it
was
safer
and
far
more
dignified
but
at
the
same
time
she
yearned
for
an
opportunity
of
teaching
this
presumptuous
young
man
a
lesson
so
far
he
had
had
it
all
his
own
way
a
way
strewn
with
ambiguities
which
a
modest
maiden
had
to
ignore
despite
herself
of
course
wilks
may
have
had
a
disappointment
said
hardy
with
the
air
of
one
willing
to
make
allowances
i
believe
he
had
about
fifty
said
the
girl
carelessly
hardy
shook
his
head
in
strong
disapproval
no
man
should
have
more
than
one
he
said
firmly
a
man
of
any
strength
of
will
would
have
that
strength
of
will
repeated
the
astonished
miss
nugent
their
eyes
met
hers
sparkling
with
indignation
his
full
of
cold
calculation
if
he
had
had
any
doubts
before
he
was
quite
sure
now
that
he
had
gone
the
right
way
to
work
to
attract
her
attention
she
was
almost
quivering
with
excitement
your
ideas
will
probably
change
with
age
and
disappointment
she
said
sweetly
i
shall
not
be
disappointed
said
hardy
coolly
i
take
care
of
that
miss
nugent
eyed
him
wistfully
and
racked
her
brains
for
an
appropriate
and
crushing
rejoinder
in
all
her
experience
and
it
was
considerable
considering
her
years
she
had
never
met
with
such
carefully
constructed
audacity
and
she
longed
with
a
great
longing
to
lure
him
into
the
open
and
destroy
him
she
was
still
considering
ways
and
means
of
doing
this
when
the
door
opened
and
revealed
the
surprised
and
angry
form
of
her
father
and
behind
it
the
pallid
countenance
of
wilks
for
a
moment
anger
deprived
the
captain
of
utterance
who
he
stammered
what
what
a
long
time
you
been
father
said
miss
nugent
in
a
reproving
voice
i
began
to
be
afraid
you
were
never
going
you
come
home
with
me
said
the
captain
recovering
the
command
was
given
in
his
most
imperious
manner
and
his
daughter
dropped
her
muff
in
some
resentment
as
she
rose
in
order
to
let
him
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
hardy
pick
it
up
it
rolled
however
in
his
direction
and
he
stooped
for
it
just
as
hardy
darted
forward
their
heads
met
with
a
crash
and
miss
nugent
forgot
her
own
consternation
in
the
joy
of
beholding
the
pitiable
exhibition
which
terror
made
of
wilks
i
very
sorry
said
hardy
as
he
reverently
dusted
the
muff
on
his
before
returning
it
i
afraid
it
was
my
fault
it
was
said
the
infuriated
captain
as
he
held
the
door
open
for
his
daughter
now
kate
miss
nugent
passed
through
followed
by
her
father
and
escorted
to
the
front
door
by
the
steward
whose
faint
was
utterly
ignored
by
his
injured
commander
he
stood
at
the
door
until
they
had
turned
the
corner
and
returning
to
the
kitchen
found
his
remaining
guest
holding
his
aching
head
beneath
the
tap
illustration
he
found
his
remaining
guest
holding
his
aching
head
beneath
the
tap
and
now
said
the
captain
sternly
to
his
daughter
how
dare
you
sit
and
talk
to
that
young
cub
eh
how
dare
you
he
was
there
when
i
went
in
said
his
daughter
why
did
you
come
out
then
demanded
her
father
i
was
afraid
of
disturbing
you
and
sam
said
miss
nugent
besides
why
should
i
speak
to
him
why
shouted
the
captain
why
because
i
wo
have
it
i
thought
you
liked
him
said
miss
nugent
in
affected
surprise
you
patted
him
on
the
head
the
captain
hardly
able
to
believe
his
ears
came
to
an
impressive
stop
in
the
roadway
but
miss
nugent
walked
on
she
felt
instinctively
that
the
joke
was
thrown
away
on
him
and
in
the
absence
of
any
other
audience
wanted
to
enjoy
it
without
interruption
convulsive
and
sounds
which
she
ascribed
to
a
slight
cold
caught
while
waiting
in
the
kitchen
escaped
her
at
intervals
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
home
