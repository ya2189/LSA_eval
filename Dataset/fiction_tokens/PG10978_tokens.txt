chapter
i
sheila
legacy
just
before
his
death
marcus
arundel
artist
and
father
of
sheila
bore
witness
to
his
faith
in
god
and
man
he
had
been
lying
apparently
unconscious
his
slow
difficult
breath
drawn
at
longer
and
longer
intervals
sheila
was
huddled
on
the
floor
beside
his
bed
her
hand
pressing
his
urgently
in
the
pitiful
attempt
common
to
human
love
to
hold
back
the
resolute
soul
from
the
next
step
in
its
adventure
the
nurse
who
came
in
by
the
day
had
left
a
paper
of
instructions
on
the
table
here
a
candle
burned
under
a
yellow
shade
throwing
a
circle
of
warm
unsteady
light
on
the
head
of
the
girl
on
the
two
hands
on
the
rumpled
coverlet
on
the
dying
face
this
circle
of
light
seemed
to
collect
these
things
to
choose
them
as
though
for
the
expression
of
some
meaning
it
felt
for
them
as
an
artist
feels
for
his
composition
and
gave
to
them
a
symbolic
value
the
two
hands
were
in
the
center
of
the
glow
the
long
pale
slack
one
the
small
desperate
clinging
one
the
conscious
and
the
unconscious
life
and
death
humanity
and
god
all
that
is
mysterious
and
tragic
seemed
to
find
expression
there
in
the
two
hands
so
they
had
been
for
six
hours
and
it
would
soon
be
morning
the
large
bare
room
however
was
still
possessed
by
night
and
the
city
outside
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
of
life
almost
soundless
against
the
skylight
the
winter
stars
seemed
to
be
pressing
the
sky
was
laid
across
the
panes
of
glass
like
a
purple
cloth
in
which
sparks
burned
suddenly
and
with
strength
arundel
sat
up
sheila
rose
with
him
drawing
up
his
hand
in
hers
to
her
heart
keep
looking
at
the
stars
sheila
he
said
with
thrilling
emphasis
and
widened
his
eyes
at
the
visible
host
of
them
then
he
looked
down
at
her
his
eyes
shone
as
though
they
had
caught
a
reflection
from
the
myriad
lights
it
is
a
good
old
world
he
said
heartily
in
a
warm
and
human
voice
and
he
smiled
his
smile
of
everyday
sheila
thanked
god
for
his
return
and
on
the
very
instant
he
was
gone
he
dropped
back
and
there
were
no
more
difficult
breaths
sheila
alone
there
in
the
garret
studio
above
the
city
cried
to
her
father
and
shook
him
till
in
very
terror
of
her
own
frenzy
in
the
face
of
his
stillness
she
grew
calm
and
laid
herself
down
beside
him
put
his
dead
arm
around
her
nestled
her
head
against
his
shoulder
she
was
seventeen
years
old
left
alone
and
penniless
in
the
old
world
that
he
had
just
pronounced
so
good
she
lay
there
staring
at
the
stars
till
they
faded
and
the
cold
clear
eye
of
day
looked
down
into
the
room
chapter
ii
sylvester
hudson
comes
for
his
picture
back
of
his
sallow
face
sylvester
hudson
hid
successfully
though
without
intention
all
that
was
in
him
whether
of
good
or
ill
certainly
he
did
not
look
his
history
he
was
with
long
hands
on
which
he
was
always
turning
and
twisting
a
big
emerald
he
dressed
quietly
almost
correctly
but
there
was
always
something
a
little
wrong
in
the
color
or
pattern
of
his
tie
and
he
was
too
fond
of
brown
and
green
mixtures
which
did
not
become
his
sallowness
he
smiled
very
rarely
and
when
he
did
smile
his
long
upper
lip
unfastened
itself
with
an
effort
and
showed
a
horizontal
wrinkle
halfway
between
the
pointed
end
of
his
nose
and
the
irregular
nicked
row
of
his
teeth
altogether
he
was
a
gentle
sort
of
man
who
might
have
been
anything
from
a
country
gentleman
to
a
moderately
prosperous
clerk
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
the
owner
of
a
dozen
small
not
too
respectable
hotels
through
the
west
and
had
an
income
of
nearly
half
a
million
dollars
he
lived
in
millings
a
town
in
a
certain
state
where
flourished
the
most
pretentious
and
respectable
of
his
hotels
it
had
a
famous
bar
to
which
rode
the
the
cowboys
the
ranchers
the
of
the
surrounding
country
yes
and
sometimes
thirstiest
of
all
the
workmen
from
more
distant
a
dangerous
crew
millings
at
that
time
had
not
yielded
to
the
generally
increasing
dryness
of
the
west
it
was
wet
notwithstanding
its
choking
alkali
dust
and
the
deep
pool
of
its
wetness
lay
in
hudson
bar
the
aura
it
was
named
for
a
woman
who
had
become
his
wife
when
hudson
came
to
new
york
he
looked
up
his
eastern
patrons
and
it
was
one
of
these
who
knowing
arundel
need
encouraged
the
in
his
desire
to
secure
a
picture
for
the
lobby
of
the
aura
and
took
him
for
the
purpose
to
marcus
studio
on
that
morning
hardly
a
fortnight
before
the
artist
death
sheila
was
not
at
home
marcus
in
spite
of
himself
was
managed
into
a
sale
it
was
of
an
enormous
canvas
covered
weakly
enough
by
a
thin
reproduction
of
a
range
of
the
rockies
and
a
sagebrush
flat
hudson
in
his
hollow
voice
pronounced
it
classy
say
he
said
put
a
little
life
into
the
foreground
and
that
would
please
it
what
i
seekin
put
in
an
automobile
meetin
one
of
these
prairie
schooners
the
old
west
sayin
howdy
to
the
noo
that
will
tickle
the
trade
mark
who
was
feeling
weak
and
ill
consented
wearily
he
sketched
in
the
proposed
amendment
and
hudson
approved
with
one
of
his
wrinkled
smiles
he
offered
a
small
price
at
which
arundel
leapt
like
a
famished
hound
when
his
visitors
had
gone
the
painter
went
feverishly
to
work
the
day
before
his
death
sheila
under
his
whispered
directions
put
the
last
touches
to
the
body
of
the
it
ghastly
sighed
the
sick
man
but
it
will
do
for
millings
he
turned
his
back
sadly
enough
to
the
canvas
which
stood
for
him
like
a
monument
to
fallen
hope
sheila
praised
it
with
a
faltering
voice
but
he
did
not
turn
nor
speak
so
she
carried
the
huge
picture
out
of
his
sight
the
next
day
at
about
eleven
in
the
morning
hudson
called
he
came
with
stiff
angular
motions
of
his
long
thin
legs
up
the
four
steep
shabby
flights
and
stopped
at
the
top
to
get
his
breath
the
picture
ai
worth
the
climb
he
thought
and
then
struck
by
the
peculiar
stillness
of
the
garret
floor
he
frowned
damned
if
the
feller
ai
out
he
took
a
stride
forward
and
knocked
at
arundel
door
there
was
no
answer
he
turned
the
knob
and
stepped
into
the
studio
a
screen
stood
between
him
and
one
half
of
the
room
the
other
half
was
empty
the
place
was
very
cold
and
still
it
was
deplorably
bare
and
shabby
in
the
wintry
morning
light
some
one
had
eaten
a
meager
breakfast
from
a
tray
on
the
little
table
near
the
stove
hudson
canvas
stood
against
the
wall
facing
him
and
its
presence
gave
him
a
feeling
of
ownership
of
a
right
to
be
there
he
put
his
long
stiff
hands
into
his
pockets
and
strolled
forward
he
came
round
the
corner
of
the
screen
and
found
himself
looking
at
the
dead
body
of
his
host
the
nurse
that
morning
had
come
and
gone
with
sheila
help
she
had
prepared
arundel
for
his
burial
he
lay
in
all
the
formal
detachment
of
death
his
eyelids
drawn
decently
down
over
his
eyes
his
lips
put
carefully
together
his
hands
below
their
white
cuffs
and
black
sleeves
laid
carefully
upon
the
clean
smooth
sheet
hudson
drew
in
a
hissing
breath
and
at
the
sound
sheila
crumpled
up
in
exhausted
slumber
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
awoke
and
lifted
her
face
it
was
a
face
a
thin
white
heart
the
peak
of
her
hair
cutting
into
the
center
of
her
forehead
the
mouth
struck
a
note
of
life
with
its
dull
soft
red
there
was
not
lacking
in
this
young
face
the
slight
exaggerations
necessary
to
romantic
beauty
sheila
had
a
strange
arresting
sort
of
jaw
a
trifle
and
out
of
drawing
her
eyes
were
long
flattened
narrow
the
color
of
bubbles
filled
with
smoke
of
a
surface
brilliance
and
an
inner
mistiness
indescribable
eyes
clear
very
melting
wistful
and
beautiful
under
sooty
lashes
and
slender
arched
black
brows
sheila
lifted
this
strange
romantic
face
on
its
long
romantic
throat
and
looked
at
hudson
then
she
got
to
her
feet
she
was
soft
and
silken
smooth
and
tender
gleaming
white
of
skin
she
had
put
on
an
old
black
dress
just
a
scrap
of
a
flimsy
little
gown
a
certain
slim
crushable
quality
of
her
body
was
accentuated
by
this
flimsiness
of
covering
she
looked
as
though
she
could
be
drawn
through
a
ring
as
though
between
your
hands
you
could
fold
her
to
nothing
a
thin
little
kitten
of
silky
fur
and
small
bones
might
have
the
same
feel
as
sheila
she
stood
up
now
and
looked
tragically
and
helplessly
at
hudson
and
tried
to
speak
he
backed
away
from
the
bed
beckoned
to
her
and
met
her
in
the
other
half
of
the
room
so
that
the
leather
screen
stood
between
them
and
the
dead
man
they
spoke
in
hushed
voices
i
had
no
notion
miss
arundel
that
that
of
this
hudson
began
in
a
dry
jerky
whisper
believe
i
would
thought
of
intrudin
i
ordered
the
picture
there
from
your
father
a
fortnight
ago
and
this
was
the
day
i
was
to
come
and
give
it
a
last
before
i
came
through
with
the
cash
see
i
had
heard
he
was
sick
even
much
less
he
cleared
his
throat
gone
beyond
he
ended
quoting
from
the
millings
gazette
obituary
column
you
get
me
yes
said
sheila
in
her
voice
that
in
some
mysterious
way
was
another
expression
of
the
clear
mistiness
of
her
eyes
and
the
suppleness
of
her
body
you
are
mr
hudson
she
twisted
her
hands
together
behind
her
back
she
was
shivering
with
cold
and
nervousness
it
done
you
see
father
finished
it
hudson
gave
the
canvas
an
absent
glance
and
motioned
sheila
to
a
chair
with
a
stiff
gesture
of
his
arm
you
set
down
he
said
she
obeyed
and
he
walked
to
and
fro
before
her
say
now
he
said
i
take
the
picture
all
right
but
i
like
to
know
miss
arundel
if
you
excuse
me
how
you
fixed
fixed
sheila
faltered
why

as
to
finances

mean

some
funds
or
some
relations
or
some
friends
to
call
upon
sheila
drew
up
her
head
a
trifle
lowered
her
eyes
and
began
to
plait
her
thin
skirt
across
her
knee
with
small
delicate
fingers
hudson
stopped
in
his
walk
to
watch
this
mechanical
occupation
she
struggled
dumbly
with
her
emotion
and
managed
to
answer
him
at
last
no
hudson
father

very
poor
i

any
relations

no
friends

fishing
village
in
normandy
i
i
shall
have
to
get
some
work
say
it
was
an
ejaculation
of
pity
but
there
was
a
note
of
triumph
in
it
too
perhaps
the
joy
of
the
gratified
philanthropist
now
little
girl
the
price
of
that
picture
will
just
about
cover
your
expenses

he
came
closer
to
her
and
held
up
a
long
threatening
forefinger
it
was
a
playful
gesture
but
sheila
had
a
distinct
little
tremor
of
fear
she
looked
up
into
his
small
brown
pensive
eyes
and
her
own
were
held
as
though
their
look
had
been
fastened
to
his
with
rivets
now

arundel

of
asking

a
recommendation

been
only
too
kind
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
in
its
thin
covering
and
patted
it
wondering
at
the
silken
cool
feeling
against
his
palm
kind
miss
arundel
pshaw
my
middle
name
and
that
the
truth
why
how
does
the
song
go
t

love
that
makes
the
world
go
round
love
just
another
word
for
kindness
ai
it
and
it
not
such
a
bad
old
world
either
eh
without
knowing
it
with
the
sort
of
good
luck
that
often
attends
the
enterprises
of
such
men
hudson
had
used
a
spell
he
had
quoted
almost
literally
her
father
last
words
and
she
felt
that
it
was
a
message
from
the
other
side
of
death
she
twisted
about
in
her
chair
took
his
hand
from
her
shoulder
and
drew
it
stiff
and
sallow
to
her
young
lips
oh
she
sobbed
you
kind
it
a
good
world
if
there
are
such
men
as
you
when
sylvester
hudson
went
down
the
stairs
a
minute
or
two
after
impetuous
outbreak
his
sallow
face
was
deeply
flushed
he
stopped
to
tell
the
irishwoman
who
rented
the
garret
floor
to
the
arundels
that
sheila
future
was
in
his
care
during
this
colloquy
pure
business
on
his
side
and
mixed
business
and
sentiment
on
halligan
sylvester
did
not
once
look
the
landlady
in
the
eye
his
own
eyes
skipped
hers
now
across
now
under
now
over
there
are
some
philanthropists
who
are
overcome
with
such
bashfulness
in
the
face
of
their
own
good
deeds
but
sitting
back
alone
in
his
taxicab
on
his
way
to
the
station
to
buy
sheila
ticket
to
millings
sylvester
turned
his
emerald
rapidly
about
on
his
finger
and
whistled
to
himself
and
cryptically
he
expressed
his
glow
of
gratified
fatherliness
as
smooth
as
silk
said
sylvester
aloud
chapter
iii
the
finest
city
in
the
world
so
sheila
arundel
left
the
garret
where
the
stars
pressed
close
and
went
with
sylvester
hudson
out
into
the
world
it
was
that
morning
a
world
of
sawing
wind
of
flying
papers
and
a
world
to
meet
which
people
bent
their
shrinking
faces
and
drew
their
bodies
together
as
against
the
lashing
of
a
whip
sheila
thought
she
had
never
seen
new
york
so
drab
and
soulless
it
hurt
her
to
leave
it
under
so
desolate
an
aspect
cheery
little
old
town
is
it
said
sylvester
gee
millings
is
god
country
all
right
on
the
journey
he
put
sheila
into
a
compartment
supplied
her
with
magazines
and
left
her
for
the
most
part
to
herself
for
which
isolation
she
was
grateful
with
her
compartment
door
ajar
she
could
see
him
in
his
section
when
he
was
not
in
the
or
rather
she
could
see
his
lean
legs
his
long
dark
hands
and
the
top
of
his
sleek
head
the
rest
was
an
outspread
newspaper
occasionally
he
would
come
into
the
compartment
to
read
aloud
some
bit
of
information
which
he
thought
might
interest
her
once
it
was
the
prowess
of
a
hen
again
it
was
a
joke
about
a
another
time
it
was
the
hilliard
murder
case
a
scandal
of
new
york
the
psychology
of
which
intrigued
sylvester
is
it
queer
though
miss
arundel
that
such
things
happen
in
the
slums
and
they
happen
in
the
smart
set
but
they
do
happen
near
so
often
with
just
plain
folks
like
you
and
me
is
this
now
a
real
tenderloin
tale
south
american
wife
and
american
husband
and
all
their
love
affairs
and
then
one
day
her
up
and
shooting
him
money
quoth
sylvester
sure
makes
love
popular
now
for
that
little
poor
folks
would
hardly
stop
a
day
work
but
just
because
the
hilliards
here
have
and
why
they
run
a
couple
of
columns
about
for
a
week
what
your
opinion
on
the
subject
miss
arundel
he
was
continually
asking
this
and
poor
sheila
strange
bewildered
oppressed
by
his
intrusion
into
her
uprooted
life
would
grope
wildly
through
her
odds
and
ends
of
thought
and
find
that
on
most
of
the
subjects
that
interested
him
she
had
no
opinions
at
all
you
must
think
i
dreadfully
stupid
hudson
she
faltered
once
after
a
particularly
deplorable
failure
oh
you
a
kid
miss
sheila
that
all
your
trouble
and
i
reckon
you
half
asleep
eh
kind
of
brought
up
on
pictures
and
country
walks
in
what
the
name
of
the
foreign
part
normandy
no
friends
of
your
own
age
no
beaux
sheila
shook
her
head
smiling
her
flexible
smile
was
as
charming
as
a
child
it
dawned
on
the
gravity
of
her
face
with
an
effect
of
spring
moonlight
in
it
there
was
some
of
the
mischief
of
fairyland
what
need
is
millings
prescribed
sylvester
girlie
and
babe
will
wake
you
up
yes
and
the
boys
you
make
a
hit
in
millings
he
contemplated
her
for
an
instant
with
his
head
on
one
side
we
ai
got
anything
like
you
in
millings
sheila
looking
out
at
the
wide
nebraskan
prairies
that
slipped
endlessly
past
her
window
hour
by
hour
that
day
felt
that
she
would
not
make
a
hit
at
millings
she
was
afraid
of
millings
her
terror
of
babe
and
girlie
was
profound
she
had
lived
and
grown
up
as
it
were
under
her
father
elbow
her
adoration
of
him
had
stood
between
her
and
experience
she
knew
nothing
of
humanity
except
marcus
arundel
and
he
was
hardly
typical
a
shy
proud
sort
of
man
who
would
have
been
greatly
loved
if
he
had
not
shrunk
morbidly
from
human
contacts
sheila
irish
mother
had
wooed
and
won
him
and
had
made
a
merry
midsummer
madness
in
his
life
as
brief
as
a
dream
sheila
was
all
that
remained
of
it
but
for
all
her
quietness
the
shadow
of
his
broken
heart
upon
her
spirit
she
was
a
puck
she
could
make
laughter
and
mischief
for
him
and
for
herself
not
for
any
one
else
yet
she
was
too
shy
but
that
might
come
only
puck
laughter
is
a
little
unearthly
a
little
delicate
the
ear
of
millings
might
not
be
attuned
just
now
sheila
felt
that
she
would
never
laugh
again
sylvester
humor
certainly
did
not
move
her
she
almost
choked
trying
to
swallow
becomingly
the
anecdote
but
sylvester
talk
his
questions
even
his
jokes
were
not
what
most
oppressed
her
sometimes
looking
up
she
would
find
him
staring
at
her
over
the
top
of
his
newspaper
as
though
he
were
speculating
about
something
weighing
her
judging
her
by
some
inner
measurement
it
was
rather
like
the
way
her
father
had
looked
a
model
over
to
see
if
she
would
fit
his
dream
at
such
moments
sylvester
small
brown
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
an
artist
of
a
visionary
they
embarrassed
her
painfully
what
was
it
after
all
that
he
expected
of
her
for
an
expectation
of
some
kind
he
most
certainly
had
and
it
could
hardly
have
to
do
with
her
skill
in
washing
dishes
she
asked
him
a
few
small
questions
as
they
drew
near
to
millings
the
strangeness
of
the
country
they
were
now
running
through
excited
her
and
fired
her
courage
these
cliffs
these
purple
buttes
these
strange
twisting
cañons
with
their
fierce
green
streams
please
tell
me
about
hudson
and
your
daughters
she
asked
this
was
a
few
hours
before
they
were
to
come
to
millings
they
had
changed
trains
at
a
big
bare
glaring
city
several
hours
before
and
were
now
in
a
small
gritty
car
with
seats
they
were
running
through
a
gorge
and
below
and
ahead
sheila
could
see
the
brown
plain
with
its
patches
of
snow
and
like
a
large
group
of
red
toy
houses
the
town
of
millings
far
away
but
astonishingly
distinct
in
the
clear
air
sylvester
considering
her
question
turned
his
emerald
slowly
the
girls
are
all
miss
sheila
they
lookers
i
guess
spoiled
some
they
be
crazy
over
you
sort
of
a
noo
pet
in
the
house
eh
i
wired
to
they
must
be
hoppin
up
and
down
like
a
popper
full
of
corn
and
mrs
hudson
sylvester
grinned
the
wrinkle
cutting
long
and
deep
across
his
lip
well
she
ai
the
hoppin
kind
a
few
minutes
later
sheila
discovered
that
emphatically
she
was
not
the
hopping
kind
a
great
bony
woman
with
a
wide
flat
handsome
face
she
came
along
the
station
platform
kissed
sylvester
with
hard
lips
and
stared
at
sheila
the
stony
stare
of
her
kind
babe
ran
the
ford
down
sylly
she
said
in
the
harshest
voice
sheila
had
ever
heard
where
the
girl
trunk
sylvester
sallow
face
reddened
he
turned
quickly
to
sheila
run
over
to
the
car
yonder
miss
sheila
and
get
used
to
babe
while
i
kind
of
take
the
edge
off
momma
sheila
did
not
run
she
walked
in
a
peculiar
manner
which
gave
her
the
look
of
a
proud
deer
momma
was
taken
firmly
to
the
where
it
would
seem
the
edge
was
removed
with
difficulty
for
sheila
waited
in
the
motor
with
babe
for
half
an
hour
babe
hopped
she
hopped
out
of
her
seat
at
the
wheel
and
shook
hand
and
told
her
to
jump
right
in
sit
by
me
on
the
way
home
sheila
babe
had
a
tremendous
voice
and
leave
the
old
folks
to
gossip
on
the
back
seat
gee
you
different
from
what
i
thought
you
be
ai
you
small
though
you
got
no
form
say
millings
will
do
lots
for
you
is
pap
a
character
though
were
you
tickled
the
way
he
took
you
up
your
poppa
was
a
painter
was
he
can
you
make
a
picture
of
me
i
got
a
steady
that
would
be
just
wild
if
you
could
sheila
sat
with
hands
clenched
in
her
shabby
muff
and
smiled
her
moonlight
smile
she
was
giddy
with
the
intoxicating
heady
air
with
the
brilliant
sunset
light
with
babe
loud
cordiality
she
wanted
desperately
to
like
babe
she
wanted
even
more
desperately
to
be
liked
she
was
in
an
unimaginable
panic
now
babe
was
a
splendid
young
animal
handsome
and
round
and
rosy
her
body
crowded
into
a
braided
coat
her
face
crowded
into
a
tight
veil
her
head
with
heavy
chestnut
hair
crowded
into
a
velvet
turban
round
which
seemed
to
be
wrapped
the
tail
of
some
large
wild
beast
her
hands
were
ready
to
burst
from
yellow
buckskin
gloves
her
feet
with
high
thick
insteps
from
their
tight
thin
buttoned
boots
even
her
legs
shone
pink
and
plump
below
her
short
skirt
through
silk
stockings
that
were
threatened
at
the
seams
and
the
blue
of
her
eyes
the
red
of
her
cheeks
the
white
of
her
teeth
had
the
look
of
being
uncontainable
too
brilliant
and
full
to
stay
where
they
belonged
the
whole
creature
flashed
and
glowed
and
distended
herself
her
voice
was
a
riot
of
uncontrolled
vitality
and
as
though
to
use
up
a
little
of
all
this
superfluous
energy
she
was
violently
chewing
gum
except
for
an
occasional
slight
smacking
sound
it
did
not
materially
interfere
with
speech
there
poppa
now
she
said
at
last
say
poppa
you
two
sit
in
the
back
will
you
sheila
and
i
are
having
a
fine
time
but
poppa
you
old
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
in
your
wire
that
she
was
a
husky
girl
why
she
got
the
build
of
a
sagebrush
mosquito
sheila
babe
by
a
miracle
got
her
plump
hand
in
and
out
of
a
pocket
and
handed
a
telegram
to
her
new
friend
read
that
and
learn
to
know
poppa
sylvester
laughed
rather
sheepishly
as
sheila
read
am
bringing
home
artist
picture
for
the
aura
and
artist
daughter
husky
girl
will
help
momma
well
said
sylvester
apologetically
she
one
of
the
wiry
kind
are
you
miss
sheila
sheila
was
struggling
with
an
attack
of
hysterical
mirth
she
nodded
and
put
her
muff
before
her
mouth
to
hide
an
uncontrollable
quivering
of
her
lips
momma
had
not
spoken
her
face
was
all
one
even
tone
of
red
her
nostrils
opened
and
shut
her
lips
were
tight
sylvester
however
was
in
a
genial
humor
he
leaned
forward
with
his
arms
folded
along
the
back
of
the
front
seat
and
pointed
out
the
beauties
of
millings
he
showed
sheila
the
garage
the
and
the
trading
company
and
suddenly
pressing
her
shoulder
with
his
hand
he
cracked
out
sharply
there
the
aura
girl
his
eyes
were
again
those
of
the
artist
and
the
visionary
they
glowed
sheila
turned
her
head
they
were
passing
the
double
door
of
the
saloon
and
went
slowly
along
the
front
of
the
hotel
it
stood
on
that
corner
where
the
main
business
street
intersects
with
the
best
residence
street
its
main
entrance
opened
into
the
flattened
corner
of
the
building
where
the
roof
rose
to
a
fantastic
façade
for
the
rest
the
hotel
was
of
by
a
wooden
porch
where
at
milder
seasons
of
the
year
in
deep
wicker
chairs
men
and
women
were
always
rocking
with
the
air
of
people
engaged
in
serious
and
not
unimportant
work
at
such
friendlier
seasons
too
by
the
curb
was
always
a
ford
car
from
which
grotesquely
arrayed
travelers
from
towns
and
cities
were
descending
covered
with
alkali
dust
faces
chiffon
veils
spotted
silk
dresses
high
white
kid
boots
dangling
purses
and
all
their
men
to
a
wrinkled
sameness
of
aspect
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
porch
was
deserted
and
the
only
car
in
sight
was
hudson
own
which
wriggled
and
slipped
its
way
courageously
along
the
rutted
dirty
snow
around
the
corner
next
to
the
hotel
stood
hudson
home
it
was
a
large
house
of
tortured
architecture
cupolas
and
twisted
supports
and
strange
overlapping
scallops
of
wood
painted
wavy
green
pinkish
red
and
yellow
its
windows
were
of
every
size
and
shape
and
appeared
in
unreasonable
impossible
places
opening
enormous
mouths
on
tiny
balconies
with
twisted
posts
and
scalloped
railings
like
embroidery
patterns
one
on
top
of
the
other
up
to
a
final
absurdity
of
a
bird
cage
which
found
room
for
itself
between
two
cupolas
under
the
roof
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
hudson
mounted
grimly
followed
by
babe
sylvester
stayed
to
tinker
with
the
car
and
sheila
after
a
doubtful
tremulous
moment
went
slowly
up
the
icy
path
after
the
two
women
she
stumbled
a
little
on
the
lowest
step
and
in
recovering
herself
she
happened
to
turn
her
head
and
so
between
two
slender
aspen
trees
that
grew
side
by
side
like
white
captive
nymphs
in
hudson
yard
she
saw
a
the
sun
had
set
there
was
a
crystal
turquoise
translucency
behind
the
exquisite
snowy
peak
which
seemed
to
stand
there
facing
god
forgetful
of
the
world
behind
it
remote
and
reverent
and
most
serene
in
the
light
of
his
glory
and
just
above
where
the
turquoise
faded
to
pure
pale
green
a
big
white
star
trembled
sheila
heart
stopped
in
her
breast
she
stood
on
the
step
and
drew
breath
throwing
back
her
veil
a
flush
crept
up
into
her
face
she
felt
that
she
had
been
traveling
all
her
life
toward
her
meeting
with
this
mountain
and
this
star
she
felt
radiant
and
comforted
how
beautiful
she
whispered
sylvester
had
joined
her
finest
city
in
the
world

dickie
hudson
pushed
from
him
to
the
full
length
of
his
arm
the
ledger
of
the
aura
hotel
tilted
his
chair
back
from
the
desk
and
leaning
far
over
to
one
side
set
the
needle
on
a
phonograph
record
pressed
the
starter
and
absorbed
himself
in
rolling
and
lighting
a
cigarette
this
accomplished
he
put
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
wreathed
in
aromatic
bluish
smoke
gave
himself
up
to
complete
enjoyment
of
the
music
it
was
a
song
from
some
popular
light
opera
a
very
high
soprano
and
a
musical
tenor
duet
sentimental
humoresque
there
dry
your
eyes
i
sympathize
just
as
a
mother
would
give
me
your
hand
i
understand
we
off
to
slumber
land
like
a
father
like
a
mother
like
a
sister
like
a
brother
listening
to
this
melody
dickie
hudson
face
under
the
gaslight
expressed
a
rapt
and
spiritual
delight
tender
romantic
melancholy
he
was
a
slight
undersized
youth
very
pale
very
fair
with
the
face
of
a
delicate
boy
he
had
large
blue
eyes
in
which
lurked
a
wistful
deprecatory
smile
a
small
chin
running
from
wide
to
a
point
his
lips
were
sensitive
and
undecided
his
nose
unformed
his
hair
soft
and
easily
ruffled
there
were
hard
blue
marks
under
the
eyes
an
unhealthy
pallor
to
his
cheeks
a
slight
unsteadiness
of
his
fingers
dickie
held
a
position
of
minor
importance
in
the
hotel
and
his
pale
innocent
face
was
almost
as
familiar
to
its
patrons
as
to
those
of
the
saloon
next
door
more
familiar
to
both
than
it
was
to
residence
sometimes
for
weeks
dickie
did
not
strain
the
scant
welcome
of
his
folks
however
he
was
resolved
to
tempt
it
after
listening
to
the
record
he
strolled
over
to
the
saloon
dickie
was
curious
he
shared
millings
interest
in
the
young
lady
from
noo
york
shyness
fought
with
a
sense
of
adventure
until
a
night
fully
ten
nights
after
sheila
arrival
the
courage
he
imbibed
at
the
bar
of
the
aura
gave
him
the
necessary
impetus
he
pulled
himself
up
from
his
elbow
removed
his
foot
from
the
rail
straightened
his
spotted
tie
and
pushed
through
the
swinging
doors
out
into
the
night
it
was
a
moonlit
night
as
still
and
pure
as
an
angel
of
annunciation
a
night
that
carried
tall
silver
lilies
in
its
hands
above
the
small
sleepy
town
were
lifted
the
circling
rim
of
mountains
and
the
web
of
blazing
stars
sylvester
son
after
a
few
crunching
steps
along
the
icy
pavement
stopped
with
his
hand
against
the
wall
and
stood
not
quite
steadily
his
face
lifted
the
whiteness
sank
through
his
tainted
body
and
brain
to
the
undefiled
the
stars
blazed
awfully
for
dickie
and
the
mountains
were
awfully
white
and
high
and
the
air
shattered
against
his
spirit
like
a
crystal
sword
he
stood
for
an
instant
as
though
on
a
single
point
of
solid
earth
and
looked
giddily
beyond
earthly
barriers
his
lips
began
to
move
he
was
trying
to
put
that
mystery
that
emotion
into
words
it
white
he
murmured
and
sharp
burning
like
like
his
fancy
fumbled
like
the
inside
of
a
cold
flame
he
shook
his
head
that
did
not
describe
the
marvelous
quality
of
the
night
and
yet
if
the
world
had
gone
up
to
heaven
in
a
single
streaming
point
of
icy
fire
and
a
fellow
stood
in
it
frozen
swept
up
out
of
a
fellow
body
again
he
shook
his
head
and
his
eyes
were
possessed
by
the
wistful
apologetic
smile
he
wished
he
were
not
tormented
by
this
queer
need
of
describing
his
sensations
he
remembered
very
vividly
one
of
the
many
occasions
when
it
had
roused
his
anger
dickie
standing
with
his
hand
against
the
cold
bricks
of
the
aura
smiled
with
his
lips
not
happily
but
with
a
certain
amusement
thinking
of
how
sylvester
hand
had
cracked
against
his
cheek
and
sent
all
his
thoughts
flying
like
broken
china
he
had
been
apologizing
for
his
slowness
over
an
errand
something
about
leaves
it
had
been
the
leaves
of
those
aspens
in
the
yard
he
had
told
his
father
that
they
had
been
little
green
flames
he
had
stopped
to
look
at
them
you
damn
fool
sylvester
had
said
as
he
struck
you
damn
fool
once
when
a
stranger
asked
dickie
his
name
he
had
answered
innocently
they
probably
put
it
on
my
tombstone
dickie
concluded
and
stung
by
the
cold
he
shrank
into
his
coat
and
stumbled
round
the
corner
of
the
street
the
reek
of
spirits
trailed
behind
him
through
the
purity
like
a
soiled
rag
number
cottonwood
avenue
was
brilliantly
lighted
girlie
was
playing
the
piano
babe
voice
sassing
poppa
was
audible
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
empty
street
her
laughter
slapped
the
air
dickie
hesitated
he
was
afraid
of
them
all
of
sylvester
pensive
small
brown
eyes
and
hard
long
hands
of
babe
bodily
vigor
of
girlie
mild
contemptuous
look
of
his
mother
gloomy
furtive
tenderness
dickie
felt
a
sort
of
aching
and
compassionate
dread
of
the
rough
awkward
caress
of
her
big
red
hand
against
his
cheek
as
he
hesitated
the
door
opened
a
blaze
of
light
yellow
as
old
gold
streamed
into
the
blue
brilliance
of
the
moon
it
was
blotted
out
and
a
figure
came
quickly
down
the
steps
it
had
an
air
of
hurry
and
escape
a
small
slim
figure
it
came
along
the
path
and
through
the
gate
then
after
just
an
instant
of
hesitation
it
turned
away
from
dickie
and
sped
up
the
wide
street
dickie
named
it
at
once
that
the
girl
he
said
and
possessed
by
his
curiosity
and
by
the
sense
of
adventure
which
whiskey
had
fortified
he
began
to
walk
rapidly
in
the
same
direction
out
there
where
the
short
street
ended
began
the
steep
side
of
a
mesa
the
snow
on
the
road
that
was
graded
along
its
front
was
packed
by
the
runners
of
freighting
sleighs
but
it
was
rough
he
could
not
believe
the
girl
meant
to
go
for
a
walk
alone
and
yet
would
she
be
out
visiting
already
she
a
stranger
at
the
end
of
the
street
the
small
determined
figure
did
not
stop
it
went
on
a
little
more
slowly
but
as
decidedly
as
ever
up
the
slope
on
the
hard
frozen
crust
her
feet
made
hardly
a
sound
above
the
level
top
of
the
white
hill
the
peak
that
looked
remote
from
yard
became
immediate
it
seemed
to
peer
to
lean
forward
bright
as
a
silver
helmet
against
the
purple
sky
dickie
could
see
that
the
girl
walked
with
her
head
tilted
back
as
though
she
were
looking
at
the
sky
perhaps
it
was
the
sheer
beauty
of
the
winter
night
that
had
brought
her
out
following
slowly
up
the
hill
he
felt
a
sense
of
nearness
of
warmth
his
aching
lifelong
loneliness
was
remotely
comforted
because
a
girl
skimming
ahead
of
him
had
tilted
her
chin
up
so
that
she
could
see
the
stars
she
reached
the
top
of
the
mesa
several
minutes
before
he
did
and
disappeared
she
was
now
he
knew
on
the
edge
of
a
great
plateau
in
summer
covered
with
the
greenish
silver
of
sagebrush
now
an
unbroken
glittering
expanse
he
stood
still
to
get
his
breath
and
listen
to
the
very
light
crunch
of
her
steps
he
could
hear
a
coyote
wailing
off
there
in
the
foothills
and
the
rushing
noise
of
the
small
mountain
river
that
hurled
itself
down
upon
millings
ran
through
it
at
frenzied
speed
and
made
for
the
canon
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
below
him
millings
twinkled
with
a
few
sparse
lights
and
he
could
even
from
here
distinguish
the
clatter
of
babe
voice
but
when
he
came
to
the
top
millings
dropped
away
from
the
reach
of
his
senses
here
was
dazzling
space
the
amazing
presence
of
the
mountains
the
pressure
of
the
starry
sky
far
off
already
across
the
flat
that
small
dark
figure
moved
she
had
left
the
road
which
ran
parallel
with
the
mountain
range
and
was
walking
over
the
hard
sparkling
crust
it
supported
her
weight
but
dickie
was
not
sure
that
it
would
do
the
same
for
his
he
tried
it
carefully
it
held
and
he
followed
the
faint
track
of
small
feet
it
did
not
occur
to
him
dazed
as
he
was
by
the
fumes
of
whiskey
and
the
heady
air
that
the
sight
of
a
man
in
swift
pursuit
of
her
loneliness
might
frighten
sheila
for
some
reason
he
imagined
that
she
would
know
that
he
was
sylvester
son
and
that
he
was
possessed
only
by
the
most
sociable
and
protective
impulses
he
was
besides
possessed
by
a
fateful
feeling
that
it
was
intended
that
out
here
in
the
brilliant
night
he
should
meet
her
and
talk
to
her
the
adventurous
heart
of
dickie
was
aflame
when
the
hurrying
figure
stopped
and
turned
quickly
he
did
not
pause
but
rather
hastened
his
steps
he
saw
her
lift
her
muff
up
to
her
heart
saw
her
waver
then
move
resolutely
toward
him
she
came
thus
two
or
three
steps
when
a
treacherous
pitfall
in
the
snow
opened
under
her
frightened
feet
and
she
went
down
almost
shoulder
deep
dickie
ran
forward
bending
over
her
he
saw
her
white
face
and
its
red
mouth
as
startling
as
a
june
rose
out
here
in
the
snow
and
he
saw
too
the
panic
of
her
shining
eyes
miss
arundel
his
voice
came
thin
and
tender
feeling
its
way
doubtfully
as
though
it
was
too
heavy
a
reality
let
me
help
you
you
miss
arundel
are
you
i
dickie
dickie
hudson
pap
son
you
had
ought
to
be
scared
i
saw
you
coming
out
alone
and
took
after
you
i
thought
you
might
find
it
kind
of
lonesome
up
here
on
the
flat
at
night
in
all
the
moonlight
hearing
the
coyotes
and
all
and
you
might
have
had
a
time
getting
out
of
the
snow
oncet
a
fellow
breaks
through
it
sure
means
a
floundering
time
before
a
fellow
pulls
himself
out
she
had
given
him
a
hand
and
he
had
pulled
her
up
beside
him
her
smile
of
relief
seemed
very
beautiful
to
dickie
i
came
out
she
said
because
it
looked
so
wonderful
and
i
wanted
to
see
she
stopped
looking
at
him
doubtfully
as
though
she
expected
him
not
to
understand
to
think
her
rather
mad
but
he
finished
her
to
see
the
mountains
was
it
yes
she
was
again
relieved
almost
as
much
so
it
seemed
as
at
the
knowledge
of
his
friendliness
especially
that
big
one
she
waved
her
muff
toward
the
towering
peak
i
never
did
see
such
a
night
like
it
like
she
widened
her
eyes
as
though
by
taking
into
her
brain
an
immense
picture
of
the
night
she
might
find
out
its
likeness
dickie
moving
uncertainly
beside
her
murmured
like
the
inside
of
a
cold
flame
a
very
white
flame
sheila
turned
her
chin
pointed
above
the
fur
collar
of
her
coat
and
included
him
in
the
searching
and
astonished
wideness
of
her
look
you
work
at
the
aura
do
you
she
asked
with
childlike
dickie
sensitive
undecided
mouth
settled
into
mournfulness
he
looked
away
yes
he
said
plaintively
sheila
widened
eyes
still
fixed
upon
him
began
to
embarrass
him
a
flush
came
up
into
his
face
she
moved
her
look
across
him
and
away
to
the
range
it
like
that
she
said
like
a
cold
flame
going
up
how
did
you
think
of
that
dickie
looked
quickly
gratefully
at
her
i
kind
of
felt
he
said
lamely
that
i
had
got
to
find
out
what
it
was
like
but
he
shook
his
head
with
his
deprecatory
smile
but
that
do
tell
it
miss
arundel
it
more
than
that
he
smiled
again
i
bet
you
you
could
think
of
somethin
better
to
say
about
it
could
you
sheila
laughed
what
a
funny
boy
you
are
not
like
the
others
you
even
look
like
them
how
old
are
you
when
i
first
saw
you
i
thought
you
were
quite
grown
up
but
you
ca
be
much
more
than
nineteen
just
that
he
said
but
i
be
twenty
next
month

always
lived
here
in
millings
yes
do
you
like
it
i
mean
do
you
like
millings
i
hope
you
do
sheila
pressed
her
muff
against
her
mouth
and
looked
at
him
over
it
her
eyes
were
shining
as
though
the
moonlight
had
got
into
their
misty
grayness
she
shook
her
head
then
as
his
face
fell
she
began
to
apologize
your
father
has
been
so
awfully
kind
to
me
i
am
so
grateful
and
the
girls
are
awfully
good
to
me
but
millings
you
know
i
have
told
you
she
said
if
i
had
been
so
sure
you
hated
it
they
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
mesa
and
there
below
shone
the
small
scattered
lights
of
the
town
the
graphophone
was
playing
in
the
saloon
its
music
some
raucous
comic
song
insulted
the
night
why
no
said
dickie
i
do
hate
millings
i
never
thought
about
it
that
way
it
not
such
a
bad
place
honest
it
is
there
lots
of
fine
folks
in
it
have
you
met
jim
greely
why
no
but
i
seen
him
is
that
girlie
dickie
made
round
respectful
eyes
he
was
evidently
very
much
impressed
say
he
ejaculated
is
that
the
truth
girlie
aiming
kind
of
high
it
was
not
easy
to
walk
side
by
side
on
the
rutted
snow
of
the
road
sheila
here
slipped
ahead
of
him
and
went
on
quickly
along
the
middle
rut
where
the
horses
hoofs
had
beaten
a
pitted
path
she
looked
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
with
a
sort
of
malice
is
it
aiming
high
she
said
girlie
is
much
more
beautiful
than
jim
greely
oh
but
he
some
looker
jim
do
you
think
so
she
said
indifferently
with
a
dainty
touch
of
scorn
dickie
staggered
physically
from
the
shock
of
her
speech
she
had
been
speaking
was
it
possible
of
jim
greely
i
mean
james
greely
the
son
of
the
president
of
the
millings
national
bank
he
said
painstakingly
and
a
queer
confusion
came
to
him
that
the
words
were
his
feet
and
that
neither
were
under
his
control
also
he
was
not
sure
that
he
had
said
natural
or
national
i
do
mean
james
greely
sheila
clear
voice
came
back
to
him
he
is
i
should
think
a
very
great
hero
of
yours
yes
said
dickie
astonished
at
the
abject
humility
of
his
tone
sheila
stopped
and
turned
quite
around
to
look
at
him
he
seemed
to
be
floundering
in
and
out
of
invisible
holes
in
the
snow
he
stepped
very
high
plunged
put
out
his
hand
and
righted
himself
by
her
shoulder
and
he
stayed
there
lurched
against
her
for
a
moment
she
shook
him
off
and
began
to
run
down
the
hill
his
breath
had
struck
her
face
she
knew
that
he
was
drunk
dickie
followed
her
as
fast
as
he
could
several
times
he
fell
but
on
the
whole
he
made
fairly
rapid
progress
so
that
by
the
time
she
dashed
into
the
hudsons
gate
he
was
only
a
few
steps
behind
her
and
caught
the
gate
before
it
shut
sheila
fled
up
the
steps
and
beat
at
the
door
with
her
fist
dickie
was
just
behind
her
sylvester
himself
opened
the
door
back
of
him
pressed
babe
why

said
it
sheila
and
she
got
a
beau
already
some
girl

me
in
begged
sheila

i

frightened

your
brother
dickie
but
i
think
there
something
wrong
sylvester
put
his
hand
on
her
and
pushed
her
to
one
side
he
strode
out
on
the
small
porch
dickie
wavered
before
him
on
the
top
step
i
thought
i
make
the
of
the
young
lady
he
began
doubtfully
i
saw
her
admiring
at
the
stars
and
i
oh
you
did
snarled
hudson
all
right
now
go
and
make
acquaintance
with
the
bottom
step
he
thrust
a
long
hard
hand
at
dickie
chest
and
the
boy
fell
backward
clattering
ruefully
down
the
steps
with
a
rattle
of
thin
knees
and
elbows
at
the
bottom
he
lay
for
a
minute
painfully
huddled
in
the
snow
go
in
miss
sheila
said
sylvester
i
sorry
my
son
came
home
and
frightened
you
he
usually
has
more
sense
he
have
more
sense
next
time
he
ran
down
the
steps
but
before
he
could
reach
the
huddled
figure
it
gathered
itself
fearfully
together
and
fled
limping
and
staggering
across
the
yard
through
the
gate
and
around
the
corner
of
the
street
hudson
came
up
breathing
hard
where
sheila
he
asked
sharply
she
ran
upstairs
said
babe
ai
it
a
shame
what
got
into
dick
something
that
will
get
kicked
out
of
him
good
and
proper
said
his
father
grimly
he
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steep
narrow
stairs
looking
up
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
his
under
lip
stuck
out
his
eyes
were
unusually
gentle
and
pensive
i
would
had
her
scared
that
way
for
anything
he
said
not
for
anything
that
likely
to
spoil
all
my
plans
he
swore
under
his
breath
wheeled
about
and
going
into
the
parlor
he
shut
the
door
and
began
walking
to
and
fro
babe
crept
rather
quietly
up
the
stairs
there
were
times
when
even
babe
was
afraid
of
poppa
chapter
v
intercession
babe
tiptoed
up
the
first
flight
walked
solidly
and
boldly
up
the
second
and
ran
up
the
third
she
had
decided
to
have
a
talk
with
sheila
to
soothe
her
indignation
and
if
possible
to
explain
dickie
it
seemed
to
babe
that
dickie
needed
explanation
sheila
room
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
the
very
room
in
fact
whose
door
opened
on
the
bird
cage
of
a
balcony
between
two
cupolas
babe
came
to
the
door
and
knocked
a
voice
answered
sharply
come
in
and
babe
entering
shut
the
door
and
leaned
against
it
it
was
a
small
bare
whitewashed
room
with
a
narrow
cot
a
washstand
a
bureau
and
two
extraordinary
chairs
a
huge
one
that
rocked
on
damaged
springs
enclosed
in
plaited
leather
like
the
case
of
an
accordion
and
one
that
had
been
a
rocker
but
stood
unevenly
on
its
diminished
legs
babe
had
protested
against
momma
disposal
of
the
girl
from
noo
york
and
had
begged
that
sheila
be
allowed
to
share
her
own
red
white
and
blue
boudoir
below
but
sheila
had
preferred
her
small
room
it
was
red
as
a
rose
at
sunset
still
and
high
remote
from
millings
and
it
faced
the
hill
now
the
gaslight
flared
against
the
bare
walls
and
ceiling
hat
and
coat
and
muff
lay
on
the
bed
where
she
had
thrown
them
she
stood
looking
at
babe
her
face
was
flushed
her
eyes
gleamed
that
slight
exaggeration
of
her
chin
was
more
pronounced
than
usual
babe
put
her
head
on
one
side
oh
say
sheila
why
bother
about
dickie
nobody
cares
about
dickie
he
get
a
proper
from
poppa
but
i
think
myself
simple
to
be
scared
by
him
harmless
the
poor
kid
ca
half
help
himself
now
he
got
started
when
he
was
awful
young
oh
said
sheila
as
sharply
as
before
stopping
before
babe
i
not
frightened
i
angry
angry
at
myself
i
dickie
i
like
him
babe
lips
fell
apart
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
rocked
a
squealing
shaking
noise
accompanied
the
motion
her
fingers
sought
and
found
against
the
a
piece
of
which
she
had
stuck
there
during
her
last
visit
to
sheila
babe
hid
and
resurrected
as
instinctively
as
a
dog
hides
and
resurrects
his
bones
i
can
you
likin
dickie
she
remarked
ironically
but
i
do
i
tell
you
he
was
sweet
he
did
say
a
word
or
do
a
thing
to
frighten
me
but
he
was
full
shee
you
know
he
was
yes
he
been
drinking
i
smelt
it
and
he
did
walk
very
straight
and
he
was
a
little
mixed
in
his
speech
but
all
the
same
he
was
as
good
as
gold
and
friendly
and
nice
i
might
have
walked
home
quietly
with
him
and
sent
him
away
at
the
door
and
he
would
have
been
seen
by
his
father
sheila
eyes
filled
it
was
dreadful
to
to
knock
him
down
the
steps
say
if
you
had
as
much
to
put
up
with
from
dickie
as
poppa
had
oh
said
sheila
in
a
tone
that
welled
up
as
from
under
a
weight
if
i
had
always
lived
in
millings
i
drink
myself
babe
looked
red
and
resentful
but
sheila
voice
rushed
on
that
saloon
is
the
only
interesting
and
attractive
place
in
town
the
only
thrilling
people
that
ever
come
here
go
in
through
those
doors
seen
some
men
i
like
to
paint
them
i
made
some
drawings
of
them
men
from
over
there
back
of
the
mountains
you
mean
the
cowboys
from
over
the
hill
i
guess
drawled
babe
contemptuously
those
sagebrush
fellows
from
hidden
creek
i
do
think
a
whole
lot
of
them
put
one
of
them
alongside
of
one
of
our
town
boys
why
they
do
speak
good
sheila
and
they
rough
as
a
hill
trail
you
be
scared
to
death
of
them
if
you
knew
them
better
they
look
like
real
men
to
me
said
sheila
and
i
never
did
like
towns
but
you
a
town
girl
i
am
not
i
been
in
cities
and
i
been
in
the
country
i
never
lived
in
a
town
well
there
be
a
dance
one
of
these
days
next
summer
in
the
town
hall
and
maybe
you
meet
some
of
those
you
change
your
mind
about
them
why
i
sooner
dance
with
a
from
beyond
the
or
with
one
of
the
hands
from
the
than
with
those
hidden
creek
fellows
and
and
lord
knows
they
are
no
account
runaways
nothing
solid
or
respectable
about
them
take
a
boy
like
robert
now
or
jim
sheila
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
her
face
between
the
hands
looked
rather
wicked
in
a
fashion
do
mention
to
me
james
greely
of
the
millings
national
bank
babe
rose
pompously
i
think
you
kind
of
off
your
bat
sheila
arundel
she
said
chewing
noisily
first
you
run
out
at
night
with
the
mercury
at
below
and
come
dashing
back
scared
to
death
banging
at
the
door
and
then
you
tell
me
you
like
dickie
and
ask
me
not
to
mention
the
finest
fellow
in
millings
the
finest
fellow
in
the
finest
city
in
the
world
cried
sheila
and
laughed
her
laugh
was
like
a
torrent
of
silver
coins
but
it
had
the
right
maliceful
ring
of
a
brownie
ho
ho
ho
babe
stopped
in
the
doorway
and
spoke
heavily
you
short
on
sense
sheila
she
said
you
kind
of
dippy
going
out
to
look
at
the
stars
and
drawing
pictures
of
that
hidden
creek
trash
but
you
learn
better
maybe
wait
a
minute
babe
sheila
was
sober
again
and
not
unpenitent
coming
down
with
you
i
want
to
tell
your
father
that
dickie
was
sweet
to
me
i
do
want
him
to
to
what
was
it
he
was
going
to
do
bawl
dickie
out
yes
i
do
want
him
to
do
that
it
sounds
awful
well
it
is
but
it
wo
hurt
dickie
any
he
used
to
it
babe
forgiving
and
demonstrative
here
forgot
the
insult
to
millings
and
jim
greely
put
her
arm
round
sheila
and
went
down
the
stairs
squeezing
the
smaller
girl
against
the
wall
i
guess
i
wo
go
with
you
to
see
poppa
she
said
stopping
at
the
top
of
the
last
flight
poppa
kind
of
a
rough
talker
sometimes
sheila
looked
rather
alarmed
you
mean
you
think
he
he
will
bawl
me
out
i
would
wonder
babe
smiled
showing
a
lump
of
between
her
flashing
teeth
sheila
stood
halfway
down
the
stairs
she
had
not
yet
quite
admitted
to
herself
that
she
was
afraid
of
sylvester
hudson
and
now
she
did
admit
it
but
with
a
forlorn
memory
of
dickie
she
braced
herself
and
went
slowly
down
the
six
remaining
steps
the
parlor
door
was
shut
and
back
of
it
to
and
fro
prowled
sylvester
sheila
opened
the
door
hudson
face
ready
with
a
scowl
changed
he
came
quickly
toward
her
well
say
miss
sheila
i
am
sorry
sheila
shook
her
head
not
half
so
sorry
as
i
am
hudson
i
came
down
to
apologize
he
pulled
out
a
chair
and
sheila
sat
down
sylvester
placed
himself
opposite
to
her
and
lighted
a
huge
black
cigar
watching
her
meanwhile
curiously
even
anxiously
his
face
was
as
quiet
and
sallow
and
gentle
as
usual
sheila
fear
subsided
came
down
to
apologize
repeated
hudson
well
that
sounds
kind
of
upside
down
to
me
i
behaved
like
a
goose
your
son
had
done
or
said
anything
to
frighten
me
he
was
sweet
i
like
him
so
much
he
was
coming
home
and
saw
me
walking
off
alone
and
he
thought
that
i
might
be
lonely
or
frightened
or
fall
into
the
snow
which
i
did
sheila
smiled
coaxingly
i
went
down
up
to
my
neck
and
dickie
pulled
me
out
and
was
lovely
to
me
it
was
till
i
was
halfway
down
the
hill
that
i
that
it
came
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
perhaps
he
been
drinking
perhaps
said
sylvester
dryly
it
never
perhaps
with
dickie
sheila
eyes
filled
for
a
girl
the
situation
was
difficult
it
was
not
easy
to
discuss
dickie
habit
with
his
father
i
am
so
sorry
she
faltered
i
behaved
absurdly
just
because
i
saw
that
he
was
quite
himself
i
ran
away
from
him
and
made
a
scene
truly
hudson
he
had
not
said
or
done
anything
the
least
bit
horrid
been
sensible
and
nice
and
friendly
oh
dear
for
she
saw
before
her
a
relentless
and
incredulous
face
you
wo
believe
me
now
i
suppose
i
ca
altogether
miss
sheila
for
i
reckon
you
would
have
run
away
from
a
friendly
fellow
would
you
yes
hudson
i
would
because
you
see
i
did
it
was
just
a
sort
of
panic
too
much
moonshine
yes
too
much
moonshine
inside
of
dickie
i
hope
he
leaned
toward
her
and
sheila
the
child
could
not
help
but
be
flattered
by
his
deference
i
hope
you
not
thinking
that
dickie
unfortunate
habit
is
my
fault
i
his
father
and
i
own
that
saloon
but
all
the
same
not
my
fault
nor
the
aura
fault
either
i
never
did
spoil
dickie
and
i
a
sober
man
myself
he
just
naturally
ornery
no
account
he
always
was
i
believe
he
kind
of
lacking
in
the
upper
story
oh
mr
hudson
the
protest
was
so
emphatic
that
sylvester
pulled
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
brushed
away
the
smoke
and
looked
searchingly
at
sheila
she
was
sitting
very
straight
against
the
crimson
plush
of
an
enormous
her
small
figure
looked
extravagantly
delicate
and
her
little
pointed
fingers
on
the
arms
startlingly
white
and
fine
a
color
flamed
in
her
cheeks
her
eyes
and
lips
were
possessed
by
the
remorseful
earnestness
of
her
appeal
well
say
if
think
not
sylvester
narrowed
his
eyes
and
thrust
the
cigar
back
into
a
hole
made
by
his
mouth
for
its
reception
the
first
person
that
has
kind
of
agreed
with
me
on
that
point
i
ca
see
why
he
took
to
the
whiskey
anyway
moderation
my
motto
and
always
was
it
the
motto
of
the
aura
there
ai
a
bar
east
nor
west
of
the
rockies
miss
sheila
believe
that
has
the
reputation
for
decency
and
moderation
that
my
aura
has
she
classy
stylish
well
sir
she
exquisite
he
pronounced
it
i
do
mind
sayin
so
she
a
saloon
in
a
million
and
she
famous
you
can
hear
talk
of
the
aura
in
the
best
clubs
the
most
bars
of
chicago
and
noo
york
and
san
francisco
she
mighty
near
perfect
well
say
there
was
an
englishman
in
there
one
night
two
summers
ago
he
was
some
englishman
too
an
earl
that
was
him
been
all
over
the
world
east
west
and
in
between
had
a
glass
in
his
eye
one
of
those
fellers
do
you
know
what
he
told
me
miss
sheila
can
you
guess
that
the
aura
was
classy
suggested
sheila
bravely
more
that
sylvester
leaned
farther
toward
her
and
emphasized
his
words
with
the
long
forefinger
all
but
perfect
that
what
he
said
only
needs
one
thing
to
make
it
quite
perfect
what
was
the
thing
but
hudson
did
not
heed
her
question
believe
me
or
not
miss
sheila
that
saloon
but
i
do
believe
you
said
sheila
with
her
enchanting
smile
and
that
just
the
trouble
with
dickie
is
it
your
saloon
is
must
be
the
most
fascinating
place
in
millings
why
hudson
ever
since
i
came
here
i
been
longing
to
go
into
it
myself
she
got
up
after
this
speech
and
went
to
stand
near
the
stove
not
that
she
was
cold
the
small
room
which
looked
even
smaller
on
account
of
its
huge
flaming
furniture
and
the
enormous
roses
on
its
carpet
and
was
as
hot
as
a
furnace
but
because
she
was
abashed
by
her
own
speech
and
by
his
curious
reception
of
it
the
dark
blood
of
his
body
had
risen
to
his
face
he
had
opened
his
eyes
wide
upon
her
had
sunk
back
again
and
begun
to
smoke
with
short
excited
puffs
sheila
thought
that
he
was
shocked
and
she
was
very
close
to
tears
she
blinked
at
the
stove
and
moved
her
fingers
uncertainly
nice
girls
she
thought
never
want
to
go
into
saloons
then
sylvester
spoke
you
a
girl
in
a
million
miss
sheila
he
said
his
voice
was
more
cracked
than
usual
sheila
transferred
her
blinking
almost
tearful
look
from
the
stove
to
him
you
a
heap
too
good
for
said
sylvester
for
some
reason
the
girl
heart
began
to
beat
unevenly
she
had
a
feeling
of
excitement
and
suspense
it
was
as
if
after
walking
for
many
hours
through
a
wood
where
there
was
a
lurking
presence
of
danger
she
had
heard
a
nearing
step
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
sylvester
in
his
there
was
that
mysterious
look
of
appraisal
of
vision
he
seemed
nervous
rolled
his
cigar
and
moved
his
feet
are
you
satisfied
with
your
work
miss
sheila
sheila
assembled
her
courage
i
know
you
think
me
a
beast
hudson
after
all
your
kindness
and
it
is
that
i
do
like
the
work
but
i
a
feeling
no
it
more
than
a
feeling
i
that
your
wife
does
need
me
and
i
know
she
does
want
me
she
does
like
to
have
me
here
i
been
unhappy
about
that
ever
since
i
came
and
been
getting
worse
yesterday
she
said
she
could
bear
to
have
me
whistling
round
her
kitchen
hudson
sheila
voice
broke
childishly
i
ca
help
whistling
it
a
habit
i
could
work
at
all
if
i
did
whistle
i
would
have
told
you
but
since
you
asked
me
sylvester
held
up
his
long
hand
its
emerald
glittered
that
all
right
he
said
i
wanted
to
learn
the
truth
about
it
perhaps
you
noticed
miss
sheila
that
i
not
a
very
happy
man
at
home
you
mean
i
mean
said
sylvester
heavily
sheila
overcame
a
horrible
inclination
to
laugh
i
so
sorry
she
said
uncertainly
she
was
acutely
embarrassed
but
did
not
know
how
to
escape
and
she
sorry
for
him
for
certainly
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
man
married
to
momma
had
just
cause
for
unhappiness
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
for
bringing
you
here
miss
sheila
you
see
that
me
i
so
that
i
just
do
think
i
all
feelings
my
heart
stronger
than
my
head
as
the
palmists
say
he
rose
and
came
over
to
sheila
standing
beside
her
and
smiling
so
that
the
wrinkle
stood
out
sharply
across
his
unwilling
lip
did
you
ever
go
to
one
of
those
fellows
he
asked
palmists
yes
well
now
say
did
they
ever
tell
you
that
you
were
going
to
be
the
pride
and
joy
of
old
pap
hudson
give
me
your
little
paw
girl
sheila
hand
obeyed
rather
unwillingly
her
irresolute
polite
will
hudson
came
quickly
to
meet
it
spread
it
out
flat
in
his
own
long
palm
and
examined
the
small
rigid
surface
well
now
miss
sheila
i
can
read
something
there
what
can
you
read
you
goin
to
be
famous
you
goin
to
make
millings
famous
girl
you
goin
to
be
a
picture
that
will
live
in
the
hearts
of
fellows
and
keep
warm
when
they
herding
winter
nights
the
thought
of
you
is
goin
to
keep
straight
and
pull
back
here
you
goin
to
be
a
a
sort
of
a
beacon
light
he
was
holding
her
slim
hand
with
its
small
crushable
bones
in
an
excited
grip
he
was
bending
forward
not
looking
at
the
palm
but
at
her
sheila
pulled
back
wincing
a
little
what
do
you
mean
hudson
how
could
i
be
all
that
sylvester
let
her
go
he
began
to
pace
the
room
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
almost
wistfully
you
really
think
that
i
been
kind
of
nice
to
you
he
asked
indeed
you
have
i
not
a
happy
man
and
i
got
to
be
sort
of
distrustful
i
got
much
faith
in
the
thankfulness
of
people
i
got
fooled
too
often
try
me
said
sheila
quickly
he
looked
at
her
with
a
long
and
searching
look
then
he
sighed
some
day
maybe
i
will
run
away
to
bed
now
sheila
felt
as
if
she
had
been
pushed
away
from
a
door
she
drew
herself
up
and
walked
across
the
huge
flowers
of
the
carpet
but
before
going
out
she
turned
back
sylvester
quickly
banished
a
sly
smile
you
wo
be
angry
with
dickie
she
asked
not
if
it
going
to
deal
you
any
misery
little
girl
you
kind
to
me
he
put
up
his
hand
that
all
right
miss
sheila
he
said
that
all
right
it
a
real
pleasure
and
comfort
to
me
to
have
you
here
and
try
to
shape
things
so
they
suit
you
and
momma
too
trust
but
do
you
ask
me
to
put
any
faith
in
dickie
upper
story
i
climbed
up
there
too
often
i
give
up
my
plan
to
go
round
there
and
he
paused
grimly
and
bawl
him
out
suggested
sheila
with
one
of
her
puckish
impulses
hump
i
was
going
a
little
further
than
that
he
would
likely
have
done
the
bawlin
but
do
you
worry
yourself
about
dickie
he
safe
for
this
time
so
long
you
do
blame
me
or
the
aura
his
voice
on
the
last
word
suffered
from
one
of
its
cracks
it
was
as
though
it
had
broken
under
a
load
of
pride
and
tenderness
sheila
saw
for
a
moment
how
it
was
with
him
to
every
man
his
passion
and
his
dream
to
sylvester
hudson
his
aura
more
than
wife
or
child
he
loved
his
bar
it
was
a
fetish
an
idol
to
sheila
fancy
dickie
suddenly
appeared
the
sacrifice
chapter
vi
the
dickie
room
in
the
aura
hotel
was
fitted
in
between
the
men
lavatory
and
the
linen
room
it
smelt
of
soiled
linen
and
defective
plumbing
also
into
its
single
narrow
window
rose
the
dust
of
ashes
of
old
rags
and
other
refuse
thrown
into
the
back
yard
which
not
being
visible
from
the
street
supplied
the
typical
housewife
of
a
frontier
town
with
that
relaxation
from
any
necessity
to
keep
up
an
appearance
of
economy
and
cleanliness
so
desirable
to
her
soul
the
housekeeper
at
the
aura
was
not
hudson
but
an
enormously
stout
young
woman
with
blonde
hair
named
amelia
plecks
she
was
so
tightly
laced
and
booted
that
her
hard
breathing
and
creaking
were
audible
all
over
the
hotel
when
dickie
woke
in
his
narrow
room
after
his
moonlight
adventure
he
heard
this
heavy
breathing
in
the
linen
room
and
groaning
thrust
his
head
under
the
pillow
with
whatever
bitterness
his
kindly
heart
could
entertain
he
loathed
amelia
she
took
advantage
of
the
favor
of
sylvester
and
of
her
own
exalted
position
in
the
hotel
to
taunt
and
to
humiliate
him
his
plunge
under
the
pillow
did
not
escape
her
notice
ai
you
up
yet
lazybones
she
cried
rapping
on
the
wall
you
wo
get
no
breakfast
it
seven
who
at
the
desk
to
see
them
duluth
folks
off
pap
not
going
to
be
pleased
with
you
i
do
want
any
breakfast
muttered
dickie
amelia
laughed
no
i
be
bound
you
do
tongue
like
a
kitten
and
a
head
like
a
cracked
stove
she
slapped
down
some
clean
sheets
on
a
shelf
and
creaked
toward
the
hall
but
stopped
at
the
open
door
sylvester
hudson
was
coming
down
the
passage
and
she
was
in
no
mind
to
miss
the
of
dickie
which
this
visit
must
portend
she
shut
the
door
softly
therefore
and
controlled
her
breathing
but
dickie
knew
that
she
was
there
and
when
his
father
rapped
he
knew
why
she
was
there
he
tumbled
wretchedly
from
his
bed
swore
at
his
injured
ankle
hopped
to
the
door
unlocked
it
and
hopped
back
with
panic
swiftness
before
his
father
entrance
he
sat
in
his
crumpled
pajamas
amidst
his
crumpled
dingy
bedclothes
his
hair
scattered
over
his
forehead
his
large
heavy
eyes
fixed
anxiously
upon
sylvester
say
poppa
he
began
then
pap
voice
cracked
out
at
him
you
hold
your
tongue
snapped
sylvester
or
you
get
what
to
you
he
jerked
dickie
single
chair
from
against
the
wall
threw
the
clothing
from
it
and
sat
down
crossing
his
legs
and
holding
up
at
his
son
the
long
finger
that
had
frightened
sheila
dickie
blinked
at
it
you
know
what
i
was
plannin
to
do
to
you
after
last
night
i
meant
to
come
round
here
and
pull
you
out
of
your
covers
and
onto
the
floor
there
he
pointed
to
a
spot
on
the
boards
to
which
dickie
fearfully
directed
his
own
eyes
and
kick
the
stuffin
out
of
you
dickie
contemplated
the
long
pointed
russet
shoes
of
his
parent
and
shuddered
visibly
nevertheless
in
the
slow
look
he
lifted
from
the
boot
to
his
father
face
there
was
a
faint
gleam
of
irony
what
made
you
change
your
mind
he
asked
impersonally
it
was
this
curious
detachment
of
dickie
this
imperturbability
that
most
infuriated
hudson
he
flushed
just
a
little
sass
from
you
will
bring
me
back
to
the
idea
he
said
sharply
dickie
lowered
his
eyes
what
made
me
change
was
miss
arundel
kindness
she
came
and
begged
you
off
she
said
you
had
done
anything
or
said
anything
to
frighten
her
that
you
been
sylvester
drawled
out
the
two
words
in
the
of
western
mockery
and
dickie
face
was
pink
he
began
to
tie
a
knot
in
the
corner
of
one
of
his
thin
gray
i
do
know
how
sweet
and
lovely
you
can
be
dickie
when
you
lit
up
but
i
guess
you
were
awful
sweet
anyway
if
you
did
say
anything
or
do
anything
to
scare
her
you
do
deserve
a
kickin
but
just
the
same
i
a
mind
to
turn
you
out
of
millings
this
time
dickie
look
was
not
ironical
it
was
terrified
oh
poppa
say
i
try
not
to
do
it
again
i
never
heard
that
before
did
i
sneered
sylvester
you
put
shame
on
me
and
my
bar
and
i
not
goin
to
stand
it
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
buy
a
bottle
and
come
up
here
in
your
room
god
damn
you
you
a
nice
son
for
the
owner
of
the
aura
he
stood
up
and
looked
with
frank
disgust
at
the
thin
huddled
figure
under
this
look
dickie
grew
slowly
redder
and
his
eyes
watered
sylvester
lifted
his
upper
lip
faugh
he
said
he
walked
over
to
the
door
get
up
and
go
down
to
your
job
and
do
you
bother
miss
sheila
hear
me
keep
away
from
her
she
not
used
to
your
sort
and
you
disgust
her
she
here
under
my
protection
and
i
got
my
plans
for
her
i
her
guardian
that
what
i
am
sylvester
was
pleased
like
a
man
that
has
made
a
discovery
her
guardian
he
repeated
as
though
the
word
had
a
fine
taste
dickie
watched
him
there
was
no
expression
whatever
in
his
face
and
his
lips
stood
vacantly
apart
he
might
have
been
seven
years
old
keep
away
from
her
hear
me
yes
sir
said
dickie
meekly
after
his
father
had
gone
out
dickie
sat
for
an
instant
with
his
head
on
one
side
listening
intently
then
he
got
up
limped
quietly
and
quickly
on
his
bare
feet
out
into
the
hall
and
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
amelia
clean
forgot
to
lock
it
he
said
aloud
ai
she
careless
though
this
morning
he
went
back
there
was
certainly
a
sound
now
behind
the
partition
a
sound
of
hard
breathing
that
could
no
longer
be
controlled
i
hand
the
key
over
to
mary
soliloquized
dickie
in
the
hollow
and
unnatural
voice
of
stage
confidences
she
be
goin
in
for
the
towels
about
noon
then
he
fell
on
his
bed
and
smothered
a
fit
of
chuckling
suddenly
the
mirth
died
out
of
him
he
lay
still
conscious
of
a
pain
in
his
head
and
in
his
ankle
and
somewhere
else
an
indeterminate
spot
deep
in
his
being
he
had
been
forbidden
to
see
the
girl
who
ran
away
out
into
the
night
to
look
at
the
stars
the
girl
who
had
not
laughed
at
his
attempt
to
describe
the
white
ecstasy
of
the
winter
moon
he
had
frightened
her
disgusted
her
he
must
have
been
more
drunk
than
he
imagined
it
disgusting
and
so
hopeless
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
leave
millings
he
sat
up
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
let
his
hands
hang
limply
down
between
his
knees
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
thoughts
were
like
a
wheel
in
running
water
the
wheel
went
round
rapidly
plunging
in
and
out
of
his
consciousness
hardly
had
he
grasped
the
meaning
of
one
half
when
it
went
under
and
another
blur
of
moving
spokes
emerged
something
his
father
had
said
for
instance
now
began
to
pass
through
his
mind
i
got
my
plans
for
her
dickie
tried
to
stop
the
turning
wheel
because
this
speech
gave
him
a
distinct
feeling
of
anger
and
alarm
by
an
effort
of
his
will
he
held
it
before
his
contemplation
what
possible
plans
could
sylvester
have
for
sheila
did
she
understand
his
plans
did
she
approve
of
them
she
was
so
young
and
small
with
that
sad
soft
mouth
and
those
shining
misty
eyes
dickie
with
almost
a
paternal
air
shook
his
ruffled
head
he
shut
his
eyes
so
that
the
long
lashes
stood
out
in
little
points
a
vision
of
those
two
faces
sheila
so
gleaming
fair
and
open
sylvester
so
dark
and
shut
stood
there
to
be
compared
her
guardian
indeed
dickie
dressed
slowly
and
dragged
himself
down
to
the
desk
where
very
soberly
and
sadly
he
gave
the
key
of
the
linen
room
to
mary
then
he
sat
down
turned
on
the
victor
and
lit
a
cigarette
the
duluth
folks
had
gone
without
any
assistance
from
him
there
was
nothing
to
do
it
occurred
to
dickie
all
at
once
that
in
millings
there
was
always
nothing
to
do
nothing
that
is
for
him
to
do
perhaps
after
all
he
did
like
millings
perhaps
that
was
what
was
wrong
with
him
the
victor
was
playing
here
comes
tootsie
play
a
little
music
on
the
band
here
comes
tootsie
tootsie
you
are
looking
simply
grand
play
a
little
tune
on
the
piccolo
and
flutes
the
man
who
wrote
the
rag
wrote
it
especially
for
toots
here
comes
tootsie
play
a
little
music
on
the
band
on
the
last
nasal
note
the
door
of
the
aura
flew
open
and
a
resplendent
figure
crossed
the
varnish
of
the
floor
tootsie
herself
was
not
more
simply
grand
this
was
a
young
man
perhaps
it
would
be
more
descriptive
to
say
young
man
that
accompanies
young
woman
on
the
cover
of
the
average
american
magazine
he
had
a
nose
a
chin
a
beautiful
mouth
large
brown
eyes
wavy
chestnut
hair
a
ruddy
complexion
and
what
is
not
always
given
to
the
young
man
on
the
cover
a
deep
and
generous
dimple
in
the
ruddiest
part
of
his
right
cheek
he
was
dressed
in
the
latest
suit
produced
by
schaffner
and
marx
he
wore
a
tie
of
variegated
silk
which
like
browning
star
dartled
now
red
now
blue
the
silk
handkerchief
which
protruded
carefully
from
his
breast
pocket
also
dartled
so
did
the
socks
one
felt
that
the
heart
of
this
young
man
matched
his
tie
and
socks
it
was
resplendent
with
the
vanity
and
hopefulness
and
illusions
of
years
the
large
dingy
lobby
became
suddenly
a
background
to
james
greely
cashier
of
the
millings
national
bank
and
the
only
child
of
its
president
upon
the
ruffled
and
rumpled
dickie
he
smiled
pleasantly
made
a
curious
gesture
with
his
hand
they
both
belonged
to
the
knights
of
sagittarius
and
the
fire
brigade
and
came
to
lean
upon
the
desk
holiday
at
the
bank
this
morning
he
said
in
honor
of
we
giving
a
dance
in
the
hall
want
to
come
dickie
no
said
dickie
i
hurt
my
ankle
last
night
on
the
icy
pavement
and
anyhow
i
ca
dance
and
i
sort
of
find
girls
kind
of
tiresome
that
too
bad
i
sure
sorry
for
you
hudson
particularly
as
i
came
here
just
for
the
purpose
of
handing
you
over
the
cutest
little
you
ever
saw
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
an
envelope
and
held
it
away
from
dickie
you
trying
to
job
me
jim
but
dickie
had
his
head
coaxingly
on
one
side
and
his
face
was
pink
i
give
it
to
you
if
you
can
guess
the
sender
babe
wrong
girlie
well
sir
it
ai
girlie
fist
not
the
fist
she
uses
when
she
drops
dickie
eyes
fell
he
turned
aside
in
his
chair
and
stopped
the
grinding
of
the
graphophone
he
made
no
further
guess
jim
with
his
dimple
deepening
tossed
the
small
paper
into
the
air
and
caught
it
again
deftly
it
from
the
young
lady
from
noo
york
who
helping
hudson
he
said
i
guess
she
kind
of
wishful
for
a
beau
she
not
much
of
a
looker
girlie
tells
me
have
you
met
her
yet
jim
dickie
hands
were
in
his
pockets
but
his
eyes
followed
the
gyrations
of
the
paper
no
ai
that
a
funny
thing
too
seems
like
i
never
get
round
to
it
i
just
saw
her
peeping
at
me
one
day
through
the
parlor
curtains
while
i
was
saying
sweet
nothings
to
girlie
on
the
porch
i
guess
she
was
kind
of
she
skinny
and
pale
girlie
says
your
mother
has
got
any
use
for
her
i
bet
you
it
wo
be
long
before
she
makes
tracks
back
to
noo
york
dickie
girlie
says
she
wo
be
lingering
on
here
much
longer
too
much
competition
jim
handed
the
note
to
dickie
who
had
listened
to
this
speech
with
his
expression
he
made
no
comment
but
silently
unfolded
sheila
note
the
writing
itself
was
like
her
slender
and
fine
and
straight
a
little
reckless
daintily
desperate
that
i
now
on
the
white
paper
might
be
sheila
skimming
across
the
snow
dear
somehow
i
ca
call
you
hudson
i
am
so
terribly
sorry
about
the
way
i
acted
to
you
last
night
i
do
know
why
i
was
so
foolish
i
have
tried
to
explain
to
your
father
that
you
did
nothing
and
said
nothing
to
frighten
me
that
you
were
very
polite
and
kind
but
i
am
afraid
he
does
quite
understand
i
hope
he
be
very
cross
with
you
because
it
was
all
my
fault
no
not
quite
all
because
i
think
you
ought
to
have
followed
me
i
sure
you
sorry
that
you
did
but
it
was
a
great
deal
my
fault
so
i
writing
this
to
tell
you
that
i
was
really
frightened
nor
very
angry
just
sorry
and
disappointed
because
i
thought
you
were
so
very
nice
and
not
like
millings
and
you
liked
the
mountains
better
than
the
town
i
wanted
i
still
want
you
to
be
my
friend
for
i
do
need
a
friend
here
dreadfully
will
you
come
to
see
me
some
afternoon
i
hope
you
hurt
yourself
when
you
slipped
on
those
icy
steps
sincerely
sheila
arundel
dickie
put
the
note
into
his
pocket
and
looked
unseeingly
at
jim
jim
was
turning
up
the
bottoms
of
his
trousers
preparing
to
go
so
you
wo
come
to
our
dance
he
asked
straightening
himself
more
ruddy
than
ever
well
sir
said
dickie
slowly
and
indifferently
i
would
wonder
if
i
would
chapter
vii
on
that
night
while
all
millings
was
preparing
itself
for
the
dance
while
dickie
bent
close
to
his
cracked
mirror
was
tying
his
least
crumpled
tie
with
not
too
steady
fingers
while
jim
was
applying
to
his
brown
crest
a
pomade
sent
to
him
by
a
girl
in
cheyenne
while
babe
was
wondering
anxiously
whether
green
slippers
could
be
considered
a
match
or
a
foil
to
a
dress
of
turquoise
blue
while
girlie
touched
her
hair
with
sheila
arundel
prowled
about
her
room
with
hot
anger
and
cold
fear
in
her
heart
nothing
perhaps
in
all
this
mysterious
world
is
so
inscrutable
a
mystery
as
the
mind
of
early
youth
it
crawls
the
beetle
creature
in
a
hard
shell
hiding
the
dim
inner
struggle
of
its
growing
wings
moving
numbly
as
if
in
a
torpid
dream
it
has
forgotten
the
lively
grub
stage
of
childhood
and
it
can
not
foresee
the
adventure
just
ahead
this
blind
dumb
numb
imprisoned
thing
an
irritation
to
the
nerves
of
every
one
who
has
to
deal
with
it
suffers
first
it
suffers
darkly
and
dimly
the
pain
growth
and
then
it
suffers
the
sharp
agony
of
a
splitting
shell
the
dazzling
wounds
of
light
the
torture
of
first
moving
its
feeble
wings
it
drags
itself
from
its
shell
it
clings
to
its
perch
it
finds
itself
born
anew
into
the
world
when
sheila
had
left
the
studio
with
sylvester
she
was
not
yet
possessed
of
wings
now
the
shell
was
cracking
the
adventure
about
to
begin
to
a
changed
world
changed
stars
the
heavens
above
and
the
earth
beneath
were
strange
to
her
that
night
it
had
begun
this
first
piercing
contact
of
reality
rudely
enough
hudson
had
helped
to
split
the
protecting
shell
which
had
saved
growing
dreams
perhaps
momma
had
her
instructions
perhaps
it
was
only
her
own
disposition
left
by
her
knowing
husband
to
do
his
trick
for
him
sheila
had
not
overstated
the
unhappiness
that
hudson
evident
dislike
had
caused
her
in
fact
she
had
greatly
understated
it
from
the
first
moment
at
the
station
when
the
hard
eyes
had
looked
her
over
and
the
harsh
voice
had
asked
about
the
girl
trunk
sensitiveness
had
begun
to
suffer
it
was
not
easy
even
with
help
to
go
down
into
the
kitchen
and
submit
to
hudson
hectoring
momma
had
all
the
insolence
of
the
underdog
of
her
daughters
as
of
her
husband
she
was
very
much
afraid
they
all
bullied
her
babe
with
noisy
cheerful
effrontery
sass
sylvester
called
it
and
girlie
with
a
soft
unyielding
tyranny
that
had
the
smothering
pressure
of
a
large
silk
pillow
girlie
was
tall
and
serious
and
beautiful
the
proud
possessor
of
what
millings
called
a
perfect
form
she
was
inexpressibly
slow
and
untidy
vain
and
ignorant
and
at
this
time
her
whole
being
was
centered
upon
the
attentions
of
jim
greely
with
whom
she
was
keeping
company
with
jim
greely
in
her
mind
she
had
looked
sheila
over
thin
and
weary
sheila
in
her
shabby
black
dress
and
had
decided
that
here
no
danger
threatened
nevertheless
she
did
not
take
chances
sheila
had
been
in
millings
a
fortnight
and
had
not
met
the
admirable
jim
her
attempt
that
morning
to
send
the
note
to
dickie
by
jim
was
exactly
the
action
that
led
to
the
painful
splitting
of
her
shell
she
had
seen
from
her
window
sylvester
departure
after
breakfast
there
was
something
in
his
grim
angular
figure
moving
carefully
over
the
icy
pavement
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
that
gave
her
a
pang
for
dickie
she
was
sure
that
hudson
was
going
to
be
very
disagreeable
in
spite
of
her
attempt
to
soften
his
anger
and
she
was
sorry
that
dickie
with
his
odd
wistful
friendly
face
and
his
eyes
so
wide
and
youthful
and
apologetic
for
their
visions
should
think
that
she
was
angry
or
disgusted
she
wrote
her
letter
in
a
little
glow
of
rescue
and
was
proud
of
the
tact
of
that
reference
to
his
fall
down
the
steps
for
she
reasoned
that
the
of
any
boy
of
nineteen
must
suffer
poignantly
over
the
memory
of
being
knocked
down
by
his
father
before
the
eyes
of
a
strange
girl
she
wrote
her
note
and
ran
down
the
stairs
then
stopped
to
wonder
how
she
could
get
it
promptly
to
dickie
it
was
intended
as
a
poultice
to
be
applied
after
the
and
she
could
not
very
well
take
it
to
him
herself
she
knew
that
he
worked
in
the
hotel
and
the
hotel
was
just
around
the
corner
all
that
was
needed
was
a
messenger
she
was
standing
pink
of
cheek
and
vague
of
eye
fingering
her
apron
like
a
cottage
child
and
nibbling
at
the
corner
of
her
envelope
the
light
from
a
window
on
the
stairs
falling
on
the
polish
of
her
hair
when
girlie
opened
the
door
of
the
parlor
and
came
out
into
the
hall
girlie
saw
her
and
the
door
her
lazy
eyes
as
reflective
and
receptive
and
inexpressive
as
small
meadow
pools
under
a
summer
sky
rested
upon
sheila
in
the
parlor
a
pleasant
baritone
voice
was
singing
treat
me
nice
miss
mandy
jane
treat
me
nice
do
you
know
not
to
blame
lovers
all
act
just
the
same
treat
me
nice
girlie
fingers
tightened
on
the
doorknob
what
do
you
want
sheila
she
asked
and
into
the
slow
gentle
tones
of
her
voice
something
had
crept
something
sinuous
and
subtle
something
that
slid
into
the
world
with
lilith
for
the
eternal
torment
of
daughters
i
want
to
send
this
note
to
your
brother
said
sheila
with
the
simplicity
of
the
aristocrat
is
that
greely
is
he
going
past
the
hotel
she
took
a
step
toward
jim
but
girlie
held
out
her
soft
long
hand
give
it
to
me
i
ask
him
sheila
surrendered
the
note
you
better
get
back
to
the
dishes
said
girlie
over
her
shoulder
momma
kind
of
rushed
this
morning
she
helping
babe
with
her
party
dress
i
would
put
in
my
time
writing
notes
to
dickie
if
i
been
you
sort
of
risky
she
slid
in
through
the
jealous
door
and
sheila
hurried
along
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
where
there
was
an
angry
clash
and
clack
of
crockery
the
kitchen
was
furnished
almost
entirely
with
oilcloth
the
tables
were
covered
with
it
the
floor
was
covered
with
it
the
shelves
were
draped
in
it
cold
struck
up
through
the
shining
clammy
surface
underfoot
so
that
while
sheila
face
burned
from
the
heat
of
the
stove
her
feet
were
icy
the
back
door
was
warped
and
let
in
a
current
of
frosty
air
over
its
sill
a
draught
that
circled
her
ankles
like
cold
metal
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
momma
had
placed
an
enormous
tin
piled
high
with
dirty
dishes
over
which
she
was
pouring
the
contents
of
the
kettle
steam
rose
in
clouds
her
big
fierce
face
which
seen
through
holes
in
the
vapor
was
like
that
of
a
handsome
vulgar
witch
through
the
steam
she
shot
at
sheila
a
cruel
look
are
you
planning
to
do
any
work
sheila
she
asked
in
her
voice
of
harsh
monotonous
accents
here
it
nine
and
i
ai
been
able
to
do
a
stroke
to
babe
dress
i
dunno
what
you
was
designed
for
in
this
house
an
ornament
on
the
parlor
mantel
i
guess
sheila
heart
suffered
one
of
the
terrible
swift
enlargements
of
angry
youth
it
seemed
to
fill
her
chest
and
stop
her
breath
forcing
water
into
her
eyes
she
could
not
speak
went
quickly
up
and
took
the
kettle
from
momma
red
hand
the
table
at
which
was
done
was
inconveniently
high
when
the
big
dishpan
with
its
piled
dishes
topped
it
sheila
arms
and
back
were
strained
over
her
work
she
usually
pulled
up
a
box
on
which
she
stood
but
now
she
went
to
work
blindly
her
teeth
clenched
her
flexible
red
lips
set
close
to
cover
them
the
celtic
fire
of
her
irish
blood
gave
her
eyes
a
sort
of
phosphorescent
glitter
momma
looked
at
her
do
show
temper
she
said
what
were
you
doin
upstairs
work
i
was
writing
a
letter
said
sheila
in
a
low
voice
beginning
to
wash
the
plates
and
shrinking
at
the
pain
of
scalding
water
hmp
writing
letters
at
this
hour
one
of
your
friends
back
east
i
thought
it
was
about
time
somebody
was
looking
you
up
what
do
your
acquaintance
think
of
you
comin
west
with
sylly
now
that
she
was
at
liberty
to
put
a
stroke
of
work
on
babe
dress
momma
seemed
in
no
particular
hurry
to
do
so
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
wrapping
her
great
bony
arms
in
her
checked
apron
and
staring
at
sheila
her
eyes
were
like
girlie
turned
to
stone
as
blank
and
blind
as
living
eyes
can
be
sheila
did
not
answer
she
was
white
and
her
hands
shook
hmp
said
momma
again
we
are
goin
to
talk
about
our
acquaintance
are
we
well
some
folks
acquaintance
do
bear
about
they
either
too
fine
or
they
ai
the
kind
that
gets
into
decent
conversation
she
walked
away
sheila
did
her
work
holding
her
anger
and
her
misery
away
from
her
refusing
to
look
at
them
to
analyze
their
cause
it
was
a
very
busy
day
the
help
babe
usually
gave
and
momma
more
effectual
assistance
were
not
to
be
had
sheila
cleaned
up
the
kitchen
swept
the
set
the
table
and
cooked
the
supper
her
exquisite
french
omelette
and
savory
baked
tomatoes
were
reviled
the
west
knows
no
cooking
but
its
own
and
like
all
victims
of
uneducated
taste
it
prefers
the
familiar
bad
to
the
unfamiliar
good
you
spoiled
a
whole
can
of
tomatoes
said
babe
sylvester
laughed
oh
well
miss
sheila
you
learn
this
to
sheila
whose
omelette
had
been
taught
her
by
mimi
lolotte
and
whose
baked
tomatoes
delicately
flavored
with
onion
were
something
to
dream
about
and
she
had
toasted
the
bread
golden
brown
and
buttered
it
and
she
had
made
a
delectable
vegetable
soup
she
had
never
before
been
asked
to
cook
a
meal
at
number
cottonwood
avenue
and
she
was
eager
to
please
sylvester
his
comment
you
learn
fairly
took
her
breath
she
would
not
sit
down
with
them
at
the
table
but
hurried
back
into
the
kitchen
put
her
scorched
cheek
against
some
cold
linoleum
and
cried
by
the
time
dinner
was
over
and
more
dishes
ready
to
be
washed
the
cook
wounded
pride
was
under
control
her
few
tears
had
left
no
marks
on
her
face
babe
helping
her
did
not
even
know
that
there
had
been
a
shower
babe
was
excited
her
chewing
was
more
energetic
even
than
usual
it
smacked
audibly
say
sheila

yelled
above
the
clatter

repeated
sheila

momma

she
ran
at
a
sort
of
sliding
gallop
across
the
oilcloth
through
the
swinging
door
into
the
will

to
this
sheila

sylvester
murmured

and
girlie

nothing
well
vociferated
babe
i
call

just
set
my
heart
on
her
meeting
some
of
the
folks
and
getting
to

whole
two
weeks

soft
voice
was
poured
like
oil
on
the
troubled
billows
of
babe
outburst
i
see
to
her
sylvester
chair
scraped
the
floor
as
he
rose
i
know
how
to
manage
girls
trust
poppa
he
pushed
through
the
door
followed
by
babe
sheila
looked
up
at
him
helplessly
she
had
her
box
under
her
feet
and
so
was
not
entirely
hidden
by
the
dishpan
she
drew
up
her
head
and
faced
him
hudson
she
began
please
i
ca
go
to
a
dance
you
know
i
ca
nonsense
said
pap
in
the
bright
lexicon
of
youth
there
no
such
word
as
say
girl
you
can
and
you
must
i
wo
have
babe
crying
her
eyes
out
and
myself
the
most
unpopular
man
in
millings
say
leave
your
dishes
and
go
up
and
put
on
your
best
duds
that
talking
commented
babe
in
the
momma
said
hmp
and
girlie
was
silent
sheila
looked
at
her
protector
but
you
see
hudson
i
i
it
was
only
a
month
ago
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hands
to
show
him
her
black
dress
and
her
lips
trembled
pap
walked
round
to
her
and
patted
her
shoulder
i
know
he
said
i
savvy
i
get
you
little
girl
but
say
it
wo
do
you
got
to
begin
to
live
again
and
brighten
up
you
only
seventeen
and
that
no
age
for
mourning
no
nor
moping
you
must
learn
to
forget
at
least
that
is
for
he
saw
the
horrified
pain
of
her
eyes
that
is
to
be
happy
again
yes
happiness
that
got
to
be
your
middle
name
now
miss
sheila
as
a
favor
to
me
sheila
put
up
both
her
hands
and
pushed
his
from
her
shoulder
she
ran
from
him
past
babe
into
the
where
as
she
would
have
sped
by
momma
caught
her
by
the
arm
if
you
not
aimin
to
please
said
momma
harshly
wot
are
you
here
for
sheila
looked
at
her
unseeingly
pulled
herself
away
and
went
upstairs
on
wings
in
her
room
the
tumult
held
down
all
through
the
ugly
cluttered
drudging
day
broke
out
and
had
its
violent
course
she
flew
about
the
room
or
tossed
on
the
bed
sobbing
and
whispering
to
herself
her
wound
bled
freely
for
the
first
time
since
it
had
been
given
her
by
death
she
called
to
her
father
and
her
heart
writhed
in
the
grim
talons
of
its
loneliness
that
was
her
first
agony
and
then
came
the
lesser
stings
of
momma
insults
and
at
last
a
fear
an
incomprehensible
fear
she
began
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
her
western
venture
she
began
to
be
terrified
at
her
situation
all
about
her
lay
a
frozen
world
a
wilderness
so
many
thousand
miles
from
anything
that
she
and
her
father
had
ever
known
and
in
her
pocket
there
was
no
penny
for
rescue
or
escape
over
her
life
brooded
powerfully
sylvester
hudson
with
his
sallow
face
and
gentle
contemplative
eyes
he
had
brought
her
to
his
home
surely
that
was
an
honorable
and
generous
deed
he
had
given
her
over
to
the
care
and
protection
of
his
wife
and
daughters
but
why
did
hudson
like
it
why
did
she
tighten
her
lips
and
pull
her
nostrils
when
she
looked
at
her
helper
and
what
was
the
sinister
inner
meaning
of
those
two
speeches
about
the
purpose
of
her
being
in
the
house
at
all
an
ornament
on
the
parlor
mantel
aiming
to
please
him
of
the
existence
of
a
sinister
inner
meaning
momma
voice
and
look
left
no
doubt
something
was
wrong
something
was
hideously
wrong
and
to
whom
might
she
go
for
help
or
for
advice
as
though
to
answer
her
question
came
a
on
the
stair
it
was
a
slow
not
very
heavy
step
it
came
to
her
door
and
there
followed
a
sharp
but
gentle
rap
who
is
it
asked
sheila
and
suddenly
she
felt
very
weak
it
pap
open
your
door
girl
she
hesitated
her
head
seemed
to
go
round
then
she
obeyed
his
gentle
request
pap
walked
into
the
room
chapter
viii
artists
pap
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
before
he
looked
at
sheila
at
once
his
face
changed
to
one
of
deep
concern
why
girl
what
happened
to
you
you
got
no
call
to
feel
like
that
he
went
over
to
her
and
took
her
limp
hand
she
half
turned
away
he
patted
the
hand
why

is
very
pleasant
for
me

creaking
leather
chair

sat
with
a
handkerchief
clenched
in
both
her
hands
upon
which
he
drawing
up
the
other
chair
now
placed
one
of
his
she
kept
her
head

ashamed
of

pale
stained
and
distorted
little
face
which

he
withdrew
his
hand
and
took
out
a
cigar
in
a
moment
he
was
sitting
on
the
middle
of
his
spine
his
long
legs
sprawled
half
across
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
on
the
so
that
his
chin
pointed
up
to
the
ceiling
smoke
rose
from
him
as
from
a
volcano

presently
laughed
uncertainly
that
better
he
mumbled
around
his
cigar

dreadful
day

dear
sylvester
promised
quietly
she
looked
at
him
with
faint
hope
yes
dead
but
what
can
i
do
then
hudson
nodded
his
head
slowly
or
rather
he
sawed
the
air
up
and
down
with
his
chin
he
was
still
looking
at
the
ceiling
so
that
sheila
could
see
only
the
triangle
beneath
his
jaw
and
the
dark
stringy
neck
above
his
collar
i
got
a
job
for
you
girl
a
real
one
he
pulled
out
his
cigar
and
sat
up
you
remember
what
i
told
you
the
other
night
about
my
being
a
a
beacon
sheila
voice
was
delicately
tinged
with
mockery
so
was
her
doubtful
smile
yes
he
said
seriously
well
that
it
what
does
a
beacon
do
she
asked
it
burns
it
shines
it
looks
bright
it
wears
the
neatest
little
black
dress
with
a
frilly
apron
and
deep
frilly
cuffs
say
do
you
recollect
something
else
i
told
you

very
kind
to

badly
i
was
hateful
to

this
evening
and
when
you
came
to
my
door
just
now
i
was
i
was
pap
opened
his
eyes
at
her
held
his
cigar
away
from
him
and
laughed
the
laugh
was
both
bitter
and
amused
scared
of
pap
hudson
scared
but
girl
what
i
done
to
deserve
that
he
sat
forward
rested
his
chin
in
his
hand
supported
by
an
elbow
on
his
crossed
knees
and
fixed
her
with
gentle
and
reproachful
eyes
honest
you
kind
of
make
me
feel
bad
miss
sheila
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
it
was
horrid
of
me
i
only
told
you
because
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
not
worth
helping
i
do
deserve
you
to
be
so
kind
to
me
i
i
must
be
disgustingly
suspicious
well
sylvester
sighed
very
few
folks
get
me
i
kind
of
i
a
real
lonesome
sort
of
man
but
honest
miss
sheila
i
thought
you
were
my
friend
i
do
mind
telling
you
hurt
my
feelings
that
shot
kind
of
got
me
it
stuck
into
me
i
horrid
sheila
eyes
were
wounded
with
remorse
oh
well
i
not
expecting
understanding
any
more
oh
but
i
do
i
do
understand
she
said
eagerly
and
she
put
her
hand
shyly
on
his
arm
i
think
i
do
understand
you
i
very
grateful
very
fond
of
you
ah
said
sylvester
softly
that
a
good
hearing
he
lifted
his
arm
with
sheila
hand
on
it
and
touched
it
with
his
lips
you
got
me
plumb
stirred
up
he
said
with
a
certain
huskiness
well
she
took
away
her
hand
and
he
made
a
great
show
of
returning
to
common
sense
i
reckon
we
are
a
pretty
good
pair
of
friends
after
all
but
you
must
be
scared
of
me
miss
sheila
that
does
hurt
let
forget
you
told
me
that
yes
please
well
then
to
get
back
to
business
do
you
recollect
a
story
i
told
you
a
story
oh
yes
about
an
englishman
yes
that
englishman
put
his
foot
on
the
rail
and
stuck
his
glass
in
his
eye
and
set
his
tumbler
down
empty
and
he
looked
round
that
bar
of
mine
miss
sheila
you
savvy
he
been
all
over
the
globe
that
feller
and
i
should
say
his
of
bars
was
some
and
he
said
it
all
but
perfect
it
only
needs
one
thing
this
time
sheila
did
not
ask
she
waited
that
something
we
have
in
our
country
said
he
hudson
cleared
his
throat
he
also
moistened
his
lips
he
was
very
apparently
excited
he
leaned
even
farther
forward
tilting
on
the
front
legs
of
his
chair
and
thrusting
his
face
close
to
sheila
pretty
said
he
there
was
a
profound
silence
in
the
small
room
the
runners
of
a
sleigh
scraped
the
icy
street
below
its
horses
hoofs
cracked
noisily
the
music
of
a
fiddle
sounded
in
the
distance
babe
voice
humming
a
waltz
tune
rose
from
the
second
story
a
barmaid
asked
sheila
breathlessly
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
walked
over
to
the
window
the
moon
was
already
high
over
there
beckoning
stood
her
mountain
and
her
star
it
was
all
so
shining
and
pure
and
still
that
what
you
want
me
to
be
your
barmaid
yes
said
sylvester
humbly
do
make
up
your
mind
in
a
hurry
miss
sheila
wait
till
i
tell
you
more
about
it
it
it
a
kind
of
dream
of
mine
i
think
it
come
close
to
breaking
me
up
if
you
turned
down
the
proposition
the
aura
not
an
bar
and
i
not
an
man
and
say
miss
sheila
you
not
an
girl
is
that
why
you
want
me
to
work
in
your
saloon
said
sheila
staring
at
the
star
yes
that
why
let
me
tell
you
that
i
searched
this
continent
for
a
girl
to
fit
my
ideal
that
what
it
is
girl
my
ideal
that
bar
of
mine
has
got
to
be
perfect
it
near
to
perfect
now
i
want
when
that
englishman
comes
back
to
millings
to
hear
him
say
perfect
no
but
you
notice
why
miss
i
could
got
a
hundred
girls
lookers
too
the
world
full
of
lookers
why
did
you
offer
your
to
babe
or
girlie
sylvester
laughed
well
girl
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
you
did
sheila
turned
back
and
faced
him
there
was
plenty
of
color
in
her
cheeks
now
her
narrow
eyes
were
widely
opened
astonishingly
large
and
clear
they
were
when
she
so
opened
them
yes
sylvester
glanced
aside
for
an
instant
and
what
did
they
say
they
balked
sylvester
admitted
calmly
they
fine
girls
miss
sheila
and
they
lookers
but
they
just
are
quite
fine
enough
they
not
artists
like
your
poppa
and
like
you
and
like
me
sheila
put
a
hand
up
to
her
cheek
her
eyes
came
back
to
their
accustomed
narrowness
and
a
look
of
doubt
stole
into
her
face
artists
yes
sylvester
had
begun
to
walk
about
artists
why
what
an
artist
but
a
person
with
a
dream
he
wants
to
make
real
my
dream
the
aura
girl
for
three
years
now
he
his
eyes
and
moved
his
arm
in
front
of
him
as
though
he
were
putting
in
the
broad
first
lines
of
a
picture
i
seen
that
girl
there
back
of
my
bar
shining
and
and
fine
not
the
sort
of
a
girl
a
man
be
lookin
for
mind
you
just
that
a
girl
that
would
sort
of
take
your
breath
say
picture
it
sheila
he
stood
by
her
and
pointed
it
out
as
though
he
showed
her
a
view
you
a
cowboy
and
you
come
ridin
in
dusty
with
a
well
sir
a
thirst
in
your
throat
and
a
thirst
in
your
heart
and
a
thirst
in
your
soul
you
wantin
for
your
body
and
your
eyes
and
your
mind
well
you
tie
your
pony
up
there
and
you
push
open
those
doors
and
you
push
open
and
step
plumb
into
paradise
it
cool
in
there
i
picturin
a
july
evenin
miss
sheila
and
it
quiet
and
it
shining
clean
and
there
a
big
man
in
white
who
servin
drinks
cold
drinks

a
grand
smell
that
my
man
carthy
he

he
does
keep

too
and
beside
him

a
girl
well
she
the
kind
of
girl
you
the
cowboy
would
dreamed
about
lyin
out
in
your
blanket
under
the
stars
if
you
knowed
enough
to
be
able
to
dream
about
her
after
you
set
eyes
on
her
you
do
dream
about
any
other
kind
of
girl
and
just
seein
her
there
so
sweet
and
bright
and
makes
a
different
fellow
of
you
say
goin
into
that
bar
is
like
goin
into
church
and
havin
a
time
when
you
get
there
which
is
something
the
churches
have
got
round
to
offerin
yet
to
my
way
of
thinkin
now
i
want
to
ask
you
miss
sheila
if
you
got
red
blood
in
your
veins
and
a
love
of
adventure
and
a
wish
to
see
that
real
entertaining
show
we
call
and
mighty
few
females
ever
get
a
glimpse
of
it
and
if
acquired
a
feeling
of
gratitude
for
pap
and
if
you
got
any
real
religion
or
any
ambition
to
play
a
part
if
you
a
real
woman
that
wants
to
be
an
to
men
well
i
ask
you
could
you
turn
down
a
chance
like
that
he
stood
away
a
pace
and
put
his
question
with
a
lifted
forefinger
sheila
eyes
were
caught
and
held
by
his
again
her
mind
seemed
to
be
fastened
to
his
will
and
the
blood
ran
quickly
in
her
veins
her
heart
beat
she
was
excited
stirred
he
had
seen
through
her
shell
unerringly
as
no
one
else
in
all
her
life
had
seen
he
had
mysteriously
guessed
that
she
had
the
dangerous
gift
of
adventure
that
under
the
shyness
and
uncertainty
of
inexperience
there
was
no
fear
in
her
that
she
was
one
of
those
that
would
rather
play
with
fire
than
warm
herself
before
it
sheila
stood
there
discovered
and
betrayed
he
had
played
upon
her
as
upon
a
flexible
young
reed
that
stop
her
ambition
this
her
romanticism
that
her
vanity
the
fourth
her
gratitude
the
fifth
her
idealism
the
sixth
her
recklessness
and
there
was
this
added
urge
she
must
stay
here
and
drudge
under
the
lash
of
momma
tongue
or
she
must
accept
this
strange
this
unimaginable
offer
again
she
opened
her
eyes
wider
and
wider
the
pupils
swallowed
up
the
misty
gray
her
lips
parted
i
do
it
she
said
narrowed
her
eyes
and
shut
her
mouth
tight
with
such
a
look
she
might
have
thrown
a
fateful
toss
of
dice
sylvester
caught
her
hands
pressed
them
up
to
his
chest
it
a
promise
girl
yes
god
bless
you
he
let
her
go
he
walked
on
air
he
threw
open
the
door
there
on
the
threshold
stood
momma
i
kind
of
see
she
drawled
why
sheila
do
take
no
interest
in
dancin
you
wrong
said
sheila
very
clearly
i
have
been
persuaded
i
am
going
to
the
dance
sylvester
laughed
aloud
one
for
you
momma
he
said
come
on
down
old
girl
while
miss
sheila
gets
into
her
party
dress
say
aura
you
goin
to
give
me
a
dance
his
wife
looked
curiously
at
his
red
excited
face
she
followed
him
in
silence
down
the
stairs
sheila
stood
still
listening
to
their
descending
steps
then
she
knelt
down
beside
her
little
trunk
and
opened
the
lid
the
sound
of
the
fiddle
stole
hauntingly
beseechingly
tauntingly
into
her
consciousness
there
in
the
top
tray
of
her
trunk
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
lay
the
only
evening
frock
she
had
a
filmy
french
dress
of
white
tulle
a
christmas
present
from
her
father
a
intoxicating
extravagance
she
had
worn
it
only
once
it
was
with
the
strangest
feeling
that
she
took
it
out
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
sheila
that
had
worn
that
dress
was
dead
chapter
ix
a
singeing
of
wings
all
the
vitality
of
millings
and
whatever
its
deficiencies
the
town
lacked
nothing
of
the
splendor
and
vigor
of
its
youth
throbbed
and
stamped
and
shook
the
walls
of
the
town
hall
that
night
to
understand
that
dance
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
it
took
place
on
a
february
night
with
the
thermometer
at
zero
and
with
the
ground
five
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
snow
there
were
men
and
women
and
children
too
who
had
come
on
skis
and
in
toboggans
for
twenty
miles
from
distant
ranches
to
do
honor
to
the
of
greely
and
his
wife
a
room
near
the
ballroom
was
reserved
for
babies
and
here
early
in
the
evening
lay
small
bundles
in
helpless
more
or
less
protesting
rows
their
needs
attended
to
between
waltzes
and
polkas
by
father
or
mother
according
to
the
leisure
of
the
parent
and
the
nature
of
the
need
one
infant
whose
home
discipline
was
not
up
to
the
requirements
of
this
event
refused
to
accommodate
himself
to
loneliness
and
so
spent
the
evening
being
dandled
first
by
father
then
by
mother
in
a
chair
immediately
beside
the
big
drum
whether
the
spot
was
chosen
for
the
purpose
of
smothering
his
cries
or
enlivening
his
spirits
nobody
cared
to
inquire
infants
in
the
millings
and
hidden
creek
communities
where
certified
milk
and
scientific
feeding
were
unknown
were
treated
rather
like
family
parasites
to
be
attended
to
only
when
the
irritation
they
caused
became
acute
they
were
not
taken
very
seriously
that
they
grew
up
at
all
was
largely
due
to
their
being
turned
out
as
soon
as
they
could
walk
into
an
air
that
buoyed
the
entire
nervous
and
circulatory
systems
almost
above
the
need
of
any
other
stimulant
the
dance
began
when
the
first
guests
arrived
which
on
this
occasion
was
at
about
six
and
went
on
till
the
last
guest
left
at
about
ten
the
next
morning
in
the
meantime
the
greelys
hospitality
provided
every
variety
of
refreshment
when
sheila
reached
the
town
hall
crowded
between
sylvester
and
joyous
babe
in
her
turquoise
blue
on
the
front
seat
of
the
ford
while
the
back
seat
was
occupied
by
girlie
in
scarlet
and
momma
in
purple
velveteen
the
dance
was
well
under
way
the
hudsons
came
in
upon
the
tumult
of
a
quadrille
the
directions
chanted
above
the
din
were
not
very
exactly
heeded
there
was
as
much
confusion
as
there
was
mirth
sheila
standing
near
girlie
elbow
felt
the
exhilaration
which
youth
does
feel
at
the
impact
of
explosive
noise
and
motion
the
stamping
of
feet
the
shouting
the
loud
laughter
the
music
the
bounding
prancing
bodies
savagery
in
a
good
humor
childhood
again
but
without
the
painful
intensity
of
childhood
sheila
wondered
just
as
any
in
a
city
ballroom
wonders
whether
she
would
have
partners
whether
she
would
have
a
good
time
color
came
into
her
face
she
forgot
everything
except
the
immediate
prospect
of
flattery
and
rhythmic
motion
babe
pounced
upon
a
young
man
who
was
shouldering
his
way
toward
girlie
say
jim
meet
miss
arundel
gee
i
been
wanting
you
two
to
get
acquainted
sheila
held
out
her
hand
to
james
greely
who
took
it
with
a
surprised
and
dazzled
look
pleased
to
meet
you
he
murmured
and
the
dimple
deepened
in
his
ruddy
right
cheek
he
turned
his
blushing
face
to
girlie
gee
you
look
great
he
said
she
was
in
fact
very
beautiful
a
long
firm
round
body
youthful
and
strong
sheathed
in
a
skin
of
cream
and
roses
lips
that
looked
as
though
they
had
been
used
for
nothing
but
the
tranquil
eating
of
ripe
fruit
eyes
of
unfathomable
serenity
and
hair
almost
as
soft
and
creamy
as
her
shoulders
and
her
her
beauty
was
not
marred
to
jim
eyes
by
the
fact
that
she
was
chewing
gum
amongst
animals
the
only
social
poise
the
only
true
and
absence
of
shyness
is
shown
by
the
cow
she
is
diverted
from
fear
and
soothed
from
by
having
her
nervous
attention
distracted
the
smoking
man
has
this
release
the
knitting
woman
has
it
girlie
and
babe
had
it
from
the
continual
labor
of
their
jaws
every
hope
and
longing
and
ambition
in
girlie
heart
centered
upon
this
young
man
now
complimenting
her
but
as
he
turned
to
her
she
just
stood
there
and
looked
up
at
him
her
jaws
kept
on
moving
slightly
there
was
in
her
eyes
the
minimum
of
human
intelligence
and
the
maximum
of
unconscious
animal
invitation
a
blank
defenseless
expression
of
here
i
am
take
me
as
jim
greely
expressed
the
look
girlie
makes
everything
easy
she
do
give
a
fellow
any
discomfort
like
some
of
these
skittish
girls
do
she
kind
of
home
folks
at
once
we
ca
get
into
the
quadrille
now
said
jim
but
you
give
me
the
next
wo
you
girlie
sure
jim
said
the
unsmiling
rosy
mouth
jim
moved
uneasily
on
his
feet
he
shot
a
sidelong
glance
at
sheila
say
miss
arundel
may
i
have
the
next
after
meet
gates
he
added
spasmodically
as
the
hand
of
a
gigantic
friend
crushed
his
elbow
sheila
looked
up
a
yard
or
two
of
youth
and
accepted
invitation
for
the
next
the
head
at
the
top
of
the
tower
bent
itself
down
to
her
with
a
snakelike
motion
us
fellows
it
said
have
been
aiming
to
give
you
a
good
time
sheila
was
relieved
to
find
him
within
hearing
her
smile
dawned
enchantingly
it
had
all
the
inevitability
of
some
sweet
natural
event
that
very
good
of
you
fellows
i
did
know
you
knew
that
there
was
such
a
person
as
as
me
in
millings
you
bet
you
we
knew
here
goes
the
waltz
do
you
want
to
castle
it
i
worked
in
a
yellowstone
park
hotel
last
summer
and
i
wise
on
dancing
sheila
found
herself
stretched
ceilingwards
she
must
hold
one
arm
straight
in
the
air
one
elbow
as
high
as
she
could
make
it
go
and
she
must
dance
on
her
very
like
every
girl
whose
life
has
taken
her
in
and
out
of
continental
hotels
she
could
dance
and
she
had
the
gift
of
intuitive
rhythm
and
of
yielding
to
her
partner
intentions
almost
before
they
were
muscularly
expressed
gates
felt
that
he
was
dancing
with
moonlight
only
the
figure
of
speech
is
not
his
own
girlie
in
the
arms
of
jim
spoke
to
him
above
her
rigid
chin
girlie
had
the
haughty
manner
of
dancing
she
not
much
of
a
looker
is
she
jim
but
the
pain
in
her
heart
gave
the
speech
an
audible
edge
she
not
much
of
anything
said
jim
who
had
not
looked
like
the
young
man
on
the
magazine
cover
for
several
busy
years
in
vain
just
a
scrap
but
girlie
could
not
be
deceived
sheila
delicate
crystalline
beauty
pierced
her
senses
like
the
frosty
beauty
of
a
winter
star
her
dress
of
white
mist
her
slender
young
arms
her
long
slim
romantic
throat
the
finish
and
polish
of
her
every
detail
done
lovingly
as
if
by
a
pencil
her
hair
so
artlessly
simple
and
shining
smooth
and
rippled
under
the
lights
the
strangeness
of
her
face
girlie
told
herself
again
that
it
was
an
irregular
face
that
the
chin
was
not
right
that
the
eyes
were
not
and
lacked
color
that
the
nose
was
odd
defying
classification
she
knew
in
spite
of
the
rigid
ignorance
of
her
ideals
that
these
things
mysteriously
spelled
enchantment
sheila
was
as
much
more
beautiful
than
anything
millings
had
ever
seen
as
her
white
gown
was
more
exquisite
than
anything
millings
had
ever
worn
it
was
a
work
of
art
and
sheila
was
also
in
some
strange
sense
a
work
of
art
something
shaped
and
fashioned
through
generations
something
tinted
and
polished
and
retouched
by
race
something
mellowed
and
restrained
something
bred
girlie
did
not
know
why
the
white
tulle
frock
absolutely
plain
shamed
her
elaborate
red
satin
with
its
exaggerated
lines
but
she
did
know
she
did
not
know
why
sheila
subtle
beauty
was
greater
than
her
obvious
own
but
she
did
know
and
so
great
and
bewildering
a
fear
did
this
knowledge
give
her
that
for
an
instant
it
confused
her
wits
she
going
back
east
soon
she
said
sharply
is
she
jim
question
was
indifferent
but
from
that
instant
his
attention
wandered
when
he
took
the
small
crushable
silken
partner
into
his
arms
for
the
next
after
a
he
was
troubled
by
a
sense
of
hurry
by
that
desire
to
make
the
most
of
his
opportunity
that
torments
the
reader
of
a
from
the
circulating
library
say
miss
arundel
he
began
looking
down
at
the
smooth
head
you
have
given
millings
a
square
deal
sheila
looked
at
him
quizzically
you
see
went
on
jim
it
winter
now
yes
greely
it
winter
and
that
not
our
best
season
when
summer
comes
it
awfully
pretty
and
it
good
fun
we
have
all
sorts
of
larks
us
fellows
and
the
girls
you
like
a
motor
ride
would
you
not
especially
thank
you
said
sheila
who
really
at
times
deserved
the
western
condemnation
of
ornery
i
do
like
motors
in
fact
i
hate
motors
jim
swallowed
a
nervous
lump
this
girl
was
not
home
folks
she
made
him
feel
awkward
and
uncouth
he
tried
to
remember
that
he
was
james
greely
of
the
millings
national
bank
and
remembering
at
the
same
time
something
that
the
girl
from
cheyenne
had
said
about
his
smile
he
caught
sheila
eye
deliberately
and
made
use
of
his
dimple
what
do
you
like
he
asked
if
you
tell
me
what
you
like
i
i
see
that
you
get
it
you
very
powerful
are
you
you
sound
like
a
fairy
godmother
you
look
like
a
fairy
that
just
what
you
do
look
like
i
like
horses
much
better
than
motors
said
sheila
i
thought
the
west
would
be
full
of
adorable
little
ponies
i
thought
you
ride
like
wizards
bucking
you
know
well
i
can
ride
but
i
guess
you
been
going
to
the
movies
or
the
wild
west
shows
this
town
seem
kind
of
dead
after
noo
york
i
hate
the
movies
said
sheila
sweetly
say
it
would
be
easy
to
get
a
pony
for
you
as
soon
as
the
snow
goes
i
sold
my
horse
when
dad
bought
me
my
ford
sold
him
sold
your
own
special
horse
well
yes
miss
arundel
does
that
make
you
think
awfully
bad
of
me
yes
it
does
it
makes
me
think
of
you
if
i
had
a
horse
i
i
tie
him
to
my
bedpost
at
night
and
feed
him
on
and
tie
ribbons
in
his
mane
jim
laughed
delighted
at
her
childishness
it
brought
back
something
of
his
own
assurance
i
do
think
pap
hudson
would
quite
stand
for
that
would
he
seems
to
me
as
if
but
here
his
partner
stopped
short
turned
against
his
arm
and
her
face
shone
with
a
sudden
friendly
sweetness
of
surprise
there
dickie
she
left
jim
she
slipped
across
the
floor
dickie
limped
toward
her
his
face
was
white
dickie
i
so
glad
you
came
somehow
i
did
expect
you
to
be
here
but
you
lame
then
you
ca
dance
what
a
shame
after
greely
and
i
have
finished
this
could
you
sit
one
out
with
me
yes
whispered
dickie
he
was
not
as
inexpressive
as
it
might
seem
however
his
face
a
rather
startling
face
here
in
this
crowded
boisterous
room
a
face
that
seemed
to
have
come
in
out
of
the
night
bringing
with
it
a
quality
of
eternal
childhood
of
quaint
dreams
his
face
was
very
expressive
so
much
so
that
sheila
embarrassed
went
back
almost
abruptly
to
jim
her
smile
was
left
to
bewilder
dickie
he
began
to
describe
it
to
himself
and
this
was
the
first
time
a
woman
had
stirred
that
mysterious
trouble
in
his
brain
it
not
like
a
smile
at
all
thought
dickie
the
dancing
crowd
invisible
to
him
it
like
something
it
what
is
it
it
as
if
the
wind
blew
it
into
her
face
and
blew
it
out
again
it
does
come
from
anywhere
it
does
seem
to
be
going
anywhere
at
least
not
anywhere
a
fellow
knows
here
he
was
rudely
joggled
by
a
passing
elbow
and
the
pain
of
his
ankle
brought
a
sharp
damn
out
of
him
he
found
a
niche
to
lean
in
and
he
watched
sheila
and
jim
he
found
himself
not
quite
so
overwhelmed
as
usual
by
admiration
of
his
friend
his
mood
was
even
very
faintly
critical
but
as
the
dance
came
to
an
end
dickie
fell
a
prey
to
base
anxiety
how
would
poppa
take
it
if
he
dickie
should
be
seen
sitting
out
a
dance
with
miss
arundel
dickie
was
profoundly
afraid
of
his
father
it
was
a
fear
that
he
had
never
been
allowed
the
leisure
to
outgrow
sylvester
with
torture
of
hand
and
foot
and
tongue
had
fostered
it
and
dickie
childhood
had
lingered
painfully
upon
him
he
could
not
outgrow
all
sorts
of
feelings
that
other
fellows
seemed
to
shed
with
their
short
trousers
he
was
afraid
of
his
father
physically
and
morally
his
very
nerves
quivered
under
the
look
of
the
small
brown
eyes
nevertheless
as
sheila
thanked
jim
for
her
waltz
her
elbow
was
touched
by
a
cold
finger
here
i
am
said
dickie
he
had
a
demure
and
startled
look
let
sit
it
out
in
the
room
between
the
babies
and
the
two
kinds
of
a
ai
it
but
i
guess
we
can
hear
ourselves
speak
in
there
there
a
sort
of
a
bench
kind
of
a
hard
one
sheila
followed
and
found
herself
presently
in
a
place
under
a
row
of
dangling
coats
an
iron
stove
near
by
glowed
with
red
sides
and
a
round
red
mouth
it
gave
a
flush
to
dickie
pale
face
sheila
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
wistful
and
untidy
lad
yet
poor
dickie
at
the
moment
appeared
to
himself
rather
a
dashing
and
heroic
figure
he
had
certainly
shown
courage
and
had
done
his
deed
with
jauntiness
besides
he
had
on
his
only
good
suit
of
serge
very
thin
serge
it
was
one
that
he
had
bought
from
jim
and
he
was
sure
therefore
of
its
perfection
he
thought
too
that
he
had
mastered
by
the
stern
use
of
a
wet
brush
a
cowlick
which
usually
disgraced
the
crown
of
his
head
he
had
it
had
long
ago
risen
to
its
wispish
height
jim
dances
fine
do
he
dickie
said
i
kind
of
wish
i
liked
to
dance
seems
like
athletic
stunts
do
appeal
to
me
some
way
would
you
call
dancing
an
athletic
stunt
sheila
leaned
back
against
a
coat
that
smelled
strongly
of
hay
and
tobacco
and
caught
up
her
knees
in
her
two
hands
so
that
the
small
white
slippers
pointed
daintily
clear
of
the
floor
dickie
looked
at
them
it
seemed
to
him
suddenly
that
a
giant
hand
had
laid
itself
upon
his
heart
and
turned
it
backwards
as
a
pilot
turns
his
wheel
to
change
the
course
of
a
ship
the
contrary
movement
made
him
catch
his
breath
he
wanted
to
put
the
two
white
silken
feet
against
his
breast
to
button
them
inside
his
coat
to
keep
them
in
his
care
ai
it
though
he
managed
to
say
ai
it
an
athletic
stunt
i
always
heard
it
called
an
accomplishment
god
said
dickie
gently
i
never
thought
of
that
i
do
like
though
have
you
tried
it
miss
arundel
no
if
i
call
you
dickie
you
might
call
me
sheila
i
think
dickie
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
feet
sheila
he
said
he
was
curiously
eloquent
again
sheila
felt
the
confusion
that
had
sent
her
abruptly
back
to
jim
she
smoothed
out
the
tulle
on
her
knee
i
think
i
love
to
ski
is
it
awfully
hard
to
learn
no
it
just
dandy
especially
on
a
moonlight
night
like
night
before
last
and
if
you
had
skis
on
you
would
broke
through
you
go
along
so
quiet
and
easy
pushing
yourself
a
little
with
your
pole
there
a
kind
of
a
swing
to
it
he
stood
up
and
threw
his
light
thin
body
gracefully
into
the
pose
see
you
slide
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
it
as
easy
as
dreaming
and
as
still
it
like
a
gondola
suggested
sheila
dickie
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
sheila
explained
she
also
sang
a
snatch
of
a
to
show
him
the
motion
yes
said
dickie
it
like
that
it
kind
of
has
a
has
a
rhythm
i
guess
that
the
word
so
riding
i
like
to
do
the
things
that
have
that
well
then
you
ought
to
like
dancing
yes
maybe
i
would
if
it
was
for
havin
to
pull
a
girl
round
about
with
me
it
kind
of
takes
my
mind
off
the
pleasure
sheila
laughed
then
did
you
get
my
note
she
asked
yes
her
laughter
had
embarrassed
him
and
he
had
suddenly
a
hunted
look
and
are
you
going
to
be
my
friend
the
sliding
of
feet
on
a
floor
none
too
smooth
the
music
the
wailing
of
a
baby
accompanied
dickie
silence
he
was
very
silent
and
sat
very
still
his
hands
hanging
between
his
knees
his
head
bent
he
stared
at
sheila
feet
his
face
what
she
could
see
of
it
was
even
beyond
the
help
of
firelight
pale
why
dickie
i
believe
you
going
to
say
no
some
fellows
would
say
yes
dickie
answered
but
i
sort
of
promised
not
to
be
your
friend
poppa
said
i
kind
of
disgust
you
and
i
figure
that
i
would
sheila
hesitated
you
mean
because
you
you
yes
ca
you
stop
he
shook
his
head
and
gave
her
a
tormented
look
oh
dickie
of
course
you
can
at
your
age
seems
like
it
means
more
to
me
than
anything
else
dickie
dickie
yes
it
kind
of
takes
the
awful
edge
off
things
what
you
mean
i
do
understand
things
are
so
sort
of
sharp
to
me
i
mean
i
do
know
if
i
can
tell
you
i
feel
like
i
had
to
put
something
between
me
and
and
things
oh
damn
i
ca
make
you
see
no
said
sheila
distressed
it
always
dickie
went
on
i
mean
everything
kind
of
too
much
i
used
to
run
miles
when
i
was
a
kid
and
sometimes
now
when
i
can
get
out
and
walk
or
ski
the
feeling
goes
but
other
times
well
whiskey
sort
of
takes
the
edge
off
and
lets
something
kind
of
slack
down
that
gets
sort
of
screwed
up
oh
i
do
know
did
you
ever
go
to
a
doctor
about
it
dickie
looked
up
at
her
and
smiled
it
was
the
sweetest
smile
so
patient
of
this
misunderstanding
of
hers
no
then
you
do
care
to
be
my
friend
enough
to
to
try
i
would
be
a
good
friend
to
you
said
dickie
and
he
spoke
now
almost
sullenly
because
i
would
want
you
to
have
any
other
friends
i
hate
it
to
see
you
with
any
other
fellow
how
absurd
maybe
it
is
absurd
i
guess
it
seems
awful
foolish
to
you
he
moved
his
cracked
pump
in
a
sort
of
pattern
on
the
floor
again
he
looked
up
this
time
with
a
freakish
an
almost
elfin
flicker
of
his
extravagant
eyelashes
there
something
i
could
be
real
well
he
said
only
i
guess
poppa
got
there
ahead
of
me
i
could
be
a
dandy
guardian
to
you
sheila
again
sheila
laughed
but
the
ringing
of
her
silver
coins
was
not
quite
true
there
was
a
false
note
she
shut
her
eyes
involuntarily
she
was
remembering
that
instant
an
hour
or
two
before
when
sylvester
look
had
held
hers
to
his
will
the
thought
of
what
she
had
promised
crushed
down
upon
her
consciousness
with
the
smothering
sudden
weight
of
its
reality
she
could
not
tell
dickie
she
could
not
though
this
she
did
not
admit
bear
that
he
should
know
very
well
she
said
in
a
hard
and
weary
voice
be
my
guardian
that
ought
to
sober
any
one
i
think
i
shall
need
as
many
guardians
as
possible
and
here
comes
your
father
i
have
this
dance
with
him
dickie
got
hurriedly
to
his
feet
oh
gosh
said
he
he
was
obviously
and
vividly
a
victim
of
panic
sheila
small
and
very
expressive
face
showed
a
little
gleam
of
amused
contempt
my
guardian
she
seemed
to
mock
to
shorten
the
embarrassment
of
the
moment
she
stepped
quickly
into
the
elder
hudson
arm
he
took
her
hand
and
began
to
pump
it
up
and
down
keeping
time
to
the
music
and
counting
audibly
one
two
three
to
dickie
he
gave
neither
a
word
nor
look
sheila
lifted
her
chin
so
that
she
could
smile
at
dickie
over
shoulder
it
was
an
indulgent
and
forgiving
smile
but
meeting
look
it
went
out
the
boy
face
was
scarlet
his
body
rigid
his
lips
tight
the
eyes
with
which
he
had
overcome
her
smile
were
the
hard
eyes
of
a
man
contempt
had
fallen
upon
him
like
a
flame
in
a
few
dreadful
minutes
as
he
stood
there
it
burnt
up
a
part
of
his
childishness
sheila
went
on
dancing
like
a
mist
in
hudson
arms
she
knew
that
she
had
done
something
to
dickie
but
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
she
had
done
chapter
x
the
beacon
light
out
of
the
wyoming
bad
lands
orange
and
murky
blue
of
outlandish
ridges
of
streaked
rock
of
sudden
twisted
cañons
a
country
like
a
dream
of
the
far
side
of
the
moon
rode
cosme
hilliard
in
a
choking
cloud
of
alkali
dust
he
rode
down
crazy
woman
hill
toward
the
sagebrush
flat
where
in
a
of
cloudless
mountains
lay
the
town
of
millings
on
its
rapid
glacier
river
hilliard
black
hair
was
powdered
with
dust
his
olive
face
was
gray
dust
lay
thick
in
the
folds
of
his
his
pony
matched
the
road
and
plodded
wearily
coughing
and
tossing
his
head
in
misery
from
the
the
the
mosquitoes
a
swarm
of
small
tormenting
presences
his
rider
seemed
to
be
charmed
into
patience
and
yet
his
aquiline
face
was
not
the
face
of
a
patient
man
it
was
young
in
a
keen
hard
fashion
the
mouth
and
eyes
were
those
of
a
mother
golden
eyes
and
a
mouth
originally
beautiful
soft
and
cruel
which
had
been
tightened
and
straightened
by
a
will
and
experience
it
had
been
used
so
often
for
careless
humorous
smiling
that
the
cruelty
had
been
almost
worked
out
of
it
almost
not
altogether
his
mother
blood
kept
its
talons
on
him
he
was
latin
and
dangerous
to
look
at
for
all
the
big
white
teeth
the
slow
slack
western
american
carriage
the
guarded
and
amused
expression
of
the
golden
eyes
here
was
a
bundle
of
racial
contradictions
not
yet
welded
not
yet
attuned
perhaps
the
one
consistent
the
one
solvent
expression
was
that
of
alert
restlessness
cosme
hilliard
was
not
happy
was
not
content
but
he
was
eternally
entertained
he
was
not
uplifted
by
the
hopeful
illusions
proper
to
his
age
but
he
loved
adventure
it
was
a
bitter
face
bitter
and
impatient
and
unschooled
it
seemed
to
laugh
to
expect
the
worst
from
life
and
not
to
care
greatly
if
the
worst
should
come
but
for
such
minor
matters
of
dust
and
thirst
and
weariness
he
had
patience
physically
the
young
man
was
hard
and
he
rode
like
a
cowboy
and
carried
a
cowboy
rope
tied
to
his
saddle
and
the
rope
looked
as
though
it
had
been
used
millings
that
seemed
so
close
below
there
through
the
clear
high
atmosphere
was
far
to
reach
the
sun
had
slipped
down
like
a
thin
bright
coin
back
of
an
iron
rock
before
the
traveler
rode
into
the
town
his
pony
shied
wearily
at
an
automobile
and
tried
to
make
up
his
mind
to
buck
but
a
light
pressure
of
the
spur
and
a
smiling
word
was
enough
to
change
his
mind
do
be
a
fool
dusty
you
know
it
not
worth
the
trouble
remember
that
fifty
miles
you
come
the
occupants
of
the
motor
snapped
a
camera
and
hummed
away
they
had
no
prevision
of
being
stuck
halfway
up
crazy
woman
hill
with
no
water
within
fifteen
miles
or
they
would
have
exclaimed
so
gayly
at
the
beauty
and
picturesqueness
of
the
tired
cowboy
he
looks
like
a
movie
hero
does
he
said
a
girl
no
protested
the
western
driver
who
had
been
a
chauffeur
only
for
a
fortnight
and
knew
considerably
less
about
the
insides
of
his
ford
than
he
did
about
the
insides
of
hilliard
he
ai
no
show
he
the
real
thing
seems
like
you
dudes
got
things
kinder
twisted
things
ai
like
shows
shows
is
sometimes
like
things
the
real
thing
certainly
behaved
as
the
real
thing
would
he
rode
straight
to
the
nearest
saloon
and
swung
out
of
his
saddle
he
licked
the
dust
off
his
lips
looked
wistfully
at
the
swinging
door
and
turned
back
to
his
pony
you
first
dusty
damn
you
and
led
the
stumbling
beast
into
the
yard
of
the
aura
in
an
hour
or
more
he
came
back
he
had
dined
at
the
hotel
and
he
had
bathed
his
naturally
vivid
coloring
glowed
under
the
he
was
shaved
and
brushed
and
sleek
he
pushed
quickly
through
the
swinging
doors
of
the
bar
and
stepped
into
the
saloon
it
was
truly
a
famous
bar
the
aura
and
it
deserved
its
fame
it
shone
bright
and
cool
and
polished
there
was
a
cheerful
clink
of
glasses
a
subdued
comfortable
sound
of
talk
men
drank
at
the
bar
and
drank
and
played
cards
at
the
small
tables
a
giant
in
a
white
apron
stood
to
serve
the
newcomer
hilliard
ordered
his
drink
sipped
it
leisurely
then
wandered
off
to
a
table
there
he
stood
watching
the
game
not
long
after
he
accepted
an
invitation
and
joined
the
players
from
then
till
midnight
he
was
oblivious
of
everything
but
the
magic
squares
of
pasteboard
the
shifting
pile
of
dirty
silver
at
his
elbow
the
faces
vacant
clever
or
rascally
of
his
opponents
but
at
about
midnight
trouble
came
for
some
time
hilliard
had
been
subconsciously
irritated
by
the
divided
attention
of
a
player
opposite
to
him
across
the
table
this
man
with
a
long
thin
face
was
constantly
squinting
past
cosme
shoulder
squinting
and
leering
and
stretching
his
great
mouth
into
a
queer
at
last
abruptly
the
irritation
came
to
consciousness
and
cosme
threw
an
angry
glance
over
his
own
shoulder
beside
the
giant
who
had
served
him
his
drink
a
girl
stood
a
thin
straight
girl
in
black
and
white
who
held
herself
so
still
that
she
seemed
painted
there
against
the
mirror
on
the
wall
her
hands
rested
on
her
slight
hips
the
fine
pointed
ringless
fingers
white
against
the
black
stuff
of
her
dress
her
neck
too
was
white
and
her
face
the
pure
unpowdered
whiteness
of
childhood
her
chin
was
lifted
her
lips
laid
together
her
eyes
brilliant
and
clear
of
no
definite
color
looked
through
her
surroundings
she
was
very
young
not
more
than
seventeen
the
mere
presence
of
a
girl
was
startling
enough
barmaids
are
unknown
to
the
experience
of
the
average
cowboy
but
this
girl
was
trebly
startling
for
her
face
was
rare
it
was
not
western
not
even
american
it
was
a
finished
face
with
long
arched
eyebrows
large
lids
shadowed
eyes
nostrils
a
little
pinched
a
sad
and
tender
mouth
it
was
a
face
whose
lines
might
have
followed
the
pencil
of
botticelli
those
little
hollows
in
the
cheeks
that
slight
exaggeration
of
the
pointed
chin
that
silky
rippling
brown
hair
there
was
no
touch
of
artifice
it
was
an
unpainted
young
face
hair
brushed
and
knotted
simply
the
very
carriage
of
the
body
was
alien
supple
unconscious
restrained
cosme
hilliard
look
lasted
for
a
minute
returning
to
his
opponent
it
met
an
ugly
grimace
he
flushed
and
the
game
went
on
but
the
incident
had
roused
hilliard
antagonism
he
disliked
that
man
with
the
grimacing
mouth
he
began
to
watch
him
an
hour
or
two
later
cosme
thin
dark
hand
shot
across
the
table
and
gripped
the
fellow
wrist
caught
you
that
time
you
he
said
quietly
instantly
almost
before
the
speech
was
out
the
giant
in
the
apron
had
hurled
himself
across
the
room
and
gripped
the
cheat
who
stood
a
hand
arrested
on
its
way
to
his
pocket
snarling
helplessly
but
the
other
players
his
fellow
fell
away
from
hilliard
dangerously
no
shootin
said
the
giant
harshly
no
in
the
aura
it
ai
allowed
no
callin
names
either
growled
the
prisoner
me
and
my
friends
would
like
to
settle
with
the
youthful
stranger
settle
with
him
then
but
somewheres
else
no
fightin
in
the
aura
there
was
an
acquiescent
murmur
from
the
other
table
and
the
gave
in
he
exchanged
a
look
with
his
friends
and
carthy
seeing
them
disposed
to
return
quietly
to
the
game
left
them
and
took
up
his
usual
position
behind
the
bar
the
barmaid
moved
a
little
closer
to
his
elbow
hilliard
noticed
that
her
eyes
had
widened
in
her
pale
face
he
made
a
brief
contemptuous
excuse
to
his
opponents
settled
his
account
with
them
and
strolled
over
to
the
bar
from
carthy
he
ordered
another
drink
he
saw
the
girl
eyes
studying
the
hand
he
put
out
for
his
glass
and
he
smiled
a
little
to
himself
when
she
looked
up
he
was
ready
with
his
golden
eyes
to
catch
her
glance
both
pairs
of
eyes
smiled
she
came
a
step
toward
him
i
believe
i
heard
of
you
miss
he
said
a
delicate
pink
stained
her
face
and
throat
and
he
wondered
if
she
could
possibly
be
shy
some
fellows
i
met
over
in
the
big
horn
country
lately
told
me
to
look
you
up
if
i
came
to
millings
they
said
something
about
hudson
queen
it
the
hudson
hotel
is
it
a
puzzled
rather
worried
look
crept
into
her
eyes
but
she
avoided
his
question
you
were
working
in
the
big
horn
country
i
hoped
you
were
from
hidden
creek
i
on
my
way
there
he
said
i
know
that
country
well
you
come
from
over
there
no
she
smiled
faintly
but
and
here
her
breast
lifted
on
a
deep
spasmodic
sigh
some
day
i
going
there
it
not
like
any
other
country
he
said
turning
his
glass
in
his
supple
fingers
it
wonderful
but
wild
and
lonesome
you
would
be
caring
for
it
not
for
longer
than
a
sunny
day
or
two
i
reckon
he
used
the
native
phrases
with
sure
familiarity
and
yet
in
his
speaking
of
them
there
was
something
unfamiliar
evidently
she
was
puzzled
by
him
and
cosme
was
not
sorry
that
he
had
so
roused
her
curiosity
he
was
very
curious
himself
so
much
so
that
he
had
forgotten
the
explosive
moment
of
a
few
short
minutes
back
the
occupants
of
the
second
table
pushed
away
their
chairs
and
came
over
to
the
bar
for
a
while
the
barmaid
was
busy
making
their
change
answering
their
jests
bidding
them
it
was
well
miss
arundel
and
thank
you
see
you
next
saturday
miss
arundel
if
i
alive
hilliard
drummed
on
the
counter
with
his
fingertips
and
frowned
his
puzzled
eyes
wove
a
pattern
of
inquiry
from
the
men
to
the
girl
and
back
one
of
them
a
town
boy
lingered
he
had
had
a
drop
too
much
of
the
aura
hospitality
he
rested
rather
against
the
bar
and
stretched
out
his
hand
are
you
going
to
say
me
a
real
miss
sheila
he
besought
and
a
tipsy
dimple
cut
itself
into
his
cheek
do
go
home
jim
murmured
the
barmaid
you
broken
your
promise
again
it
two
he
made
great
at
her
his
hand
still
begging
its
blunt
fingers
curled
upward
like
a
thirsty
cup
his
face
was
emptied
of
everything
but
its
desire
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
miss
sheila
was
tormented
by
the
look
by
the
eyes
by
the
hand
by
the
very
presence
of
the
boy
she
pressed
her
lips
tight
drew
her
fine
arched
brows
together
and
twisted
her
fingers
i
go
home
he
asserted
obstinately
when
you
tell
me
a
proper
not
before
her
eyes
glittered
shall
i
tell
carthy
to
turn
you
out
jim
he
smiled
triumphantly
uh
said
he
your
went
out
dickie
called
him
to
answer
the
telephone
now
will
you
tell
me
sheila
cosme
hoped
that
the
girl
would
glance
at
him
for
help
he
had
his
long
steel
muscles
braced
but
after
a
moment
thought
and
she
can
think
she
as
cool
as
she
shy
commented
the
observer
she
put
her
hand
on
jim
he
grabbed
it
pressed
his
lips
upon
it
he
said
i
go
now
he
swaggered
out
as
though
she
had
given
him
a
rose
the
barmaid
put
her
hand
beneath
her
apron
and
rubbed
it
cosme
laughed
a
little
at
the
quaint
action
do
they
give
you
lots
of
trouble
miss
arundel
he
asked
her
sympathetically
she
looked
at
him
but
her
attitude
was
not
so
simple
and
friendly
as
it
had
been
evidently
her
little
conflict
with
jim
had
jarred
her
humor
she
looked
distressed
angry
cosme
felt
that
unfairly
enough
she
lumped
him
with
the
enemy
he
wondered
pitifully
if
she
had
given
the
enemy
its
name
if
her
experience
had
given
her
the
knowledge
of
such
names
he
had
a
vision
of
the
pretty
delicate
little
thing
standing
there
night
after
night
as
though
divided
by
the
bar
from
prowling
beasts
and
yet
she
was
known
over
the
whole
wide
wild
country
as
hudson
queen
her
crystal
childlike
look
must
be
one
of
those
extraordinary
survivals
a
piteous
sort
of
accident
cosme
called
himself
a
sentimentalist
spurred
by
this
reaction
against
his
more
romantic
tendencies
he
leaned
forward
he
too
was
going
to
ask
the
barmaid
for
a
or
a
greeting
or
a
his
hand
was
out
when
he
saw
her
face
stiffen
her
lips
open
to
an
oh
of
warning
or
of
fear
he
wheeled
and
flung
up
his
arm
against
a
hurricane
of
blows
his
late
opponents
had
decided
to
take
advantage
of
carthy
absence
and
inflict
chastisement
prompt
and
merciless
upon
the
youthful
stranger
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
small
frightened
oh
cosme
would
have
been
down
at
once
with
that
moment
advantage
he
fought
like
a
tiger
his
golden
eyes
ablaze
swift
and
dangerous
anger
was
one
of
his
gifts
he
was
against
the
wall
he
was
torn
from
it
one
of
his
opponents
staggered
across
the
room
and
fell
another
crumpled
up
against
the
bar
hilliard
wheeled
and
jabbed
plunged
was
down
was
up
bleeding
and
laughing
he
was
whirled
this
way
and
that
the
men
from
whom
he
had
struck
himself
free
recovered
themselves
closed
in
upon
him
a
blow
between
the
eyes
half
stunned
him
another
on
his
mouth
silenced
his
laughter
the
room
was
getting
blurred
he
was
forced
back
against
the
bar
fighting
but
not
effectively
the
snarling
laughter
was
not
his
now
but
that
of
the
cheat
something
gave
way
behind
him
it
was
as
if
the
bar
against
which
he
was
bent
backwards
had
melted
to
him
and
hardened
against
his
foes
for
an
instant
he
was
free
from
blows
and
tearing
hands
he
saw
that
a
door
in
the
bar
had
opened
and
shut
there
was
a
small
pressure
on
his
arm
a
pressure
which
he
blindly
obeyed
in
front
of
him
another
door
opened
and
closed
he
heard
the
shooting
of
a
bolt
he
was
in
the
dark
the
small
pressure
cold
through
the
torn
silk
sleeve
of
his
white
shirt
continued
to
urge
him
swiftly
along
a
passage
he
was
allowed
to
rest
an
instant
against
a
wall
a
light
was
turned
on
with
a
little
click
above
his
head
he
found
himself
at
the
end
of
the
open
hallway
before
him
lay
the
brilliant
velvet
night
hilliard
pressed
his
hands
upon
his
eyes
trying
to
clear
his
vision
he
felt
sick
and
giddy
the
little
barmaid
face
all
terrified
and
urgent
eyes
danced
up
and
down
do
waste
any
time
she
said
get
out
of
millings
your
pony
at
that
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
i
not
leaving
millings
till
he
said
uncertainly
with
wounded
lips
do
look
like
that
girl
i
not
much
hurt
if
i
not
mistaken
your
is
back
and
very
much
on
his
job
i
reckon
that
our
friends
will
leave
millings
considerably
before
i
do
in
fact
behind
them
at
the
end
of
the
passage
there
was
a
sort
of
roar
carthy
had
returned
to
avenge
the
aura
you
sure
you
not
hurt
you
sure
they
wo
try
to
hurt
you
again
he
shook
his
head
not
they
he
stood
looking
at
her
and
the
mist
slowly
cleared
his
vision
of
her
steadied
shall
i
see
you
she
drew
back
from
him
a
little
no
she
said
i
sleep
all
the
morning
and
afterwards
i
do
see
any
one
except
a
few
old
friends
i
go
riding
he
puckered
his
eyelids
inquiringly
then
with
a
sudden
reckless
fling
of
his
shoulders
he
put
out
his
hand
boldly
and
caught
her
small
pointed
chin
in
his
palm
he
bent
down
his
head
she
stood
there
quite
still
and
white
looking
straight
up
into
his
face
the
exquisite
smoothness
of
her
little
cool
chin
photographed
itself
upon
his
memory
as
he
bent
down
closer
to
the
grave
and
tender
lips
he
was
suddenly
unaccountably
frightened
and
ashamed
his
hand
dropped
sought
for
her
small
limp
hand
his
lips
shifted
from
their
course
and
went
lower
just
brushing
her
fingers
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
confusedly
he
was
painfully
embarrassed
stammered
i
i
wanted
to
thank
you
she
said
in
the
smallest
sweet
voice
he
had
ever
heard
it
followed
his
memory
like
some
weary
pitiful
little
ghost
chapter
xi
in
the
public
eye
no
sight
more
familiar
to
the
corner
of
main
and
resident
streets
than
that
of
sylvester
hudson
ford
car
sliding
up
to
the
curb
in
front
of
his
hotel
at
two
in
a
summer
afternoon
he
would
slip
out
from
under
his
his
linen
duster
flapping
about
his
long
legs
and
he
would
stalk
through
the
rocking
meditative
observers
on
the
piazza
and
through
the
lobby
past
dickie
frozen
stare
upstairs
to
the
door
of
miss
arundel
suite
there
he
was
bidden
to
come
in
a
few
minutes
later
they
would
come
down
together
sheila
too
passing
dickie
wordlessly
and
they
would
hum
away
from
millings
leaving
a
veil
of
golden
dust
to
smother
the
comments
in
their
wake
there
were
days
when
sheila
pony
a
gift
from
jim
greely
was
led
up
earlier
than
the
hour
of
hudson
arrival
on
which
days
sheila
in
a
short
skirt
and
a
shirt
and
a
small
felt
stetson
would
ride
away
alone
toward
the
mountain
of
her
dreams
sometimes
jim
rode
with
her
it
was
not
always
possible
to
forbid
him
the
day
after
cosme
hilliard
spectacular
passage
was
one
of
days
the
pony
did
not
appear
but
sylvester
did
and
came
down
with
his
prize
the
lobby
was
crowded
sheila
threaded
her
way
amongst
the
medley
of
tourists
paused
and
deliberately
drew
near
to
the
desk
at
sight
of
her
dickie
whiteness
dyed
itself
scarlet
he
rose
and
with
an
apparent
effort
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
look
they
did
not
smile
at
each
other
sheila
spoke
sharply
each
word
a
little
soft
lash
i
want
to
speak
to
you
will
you
come
to
my
when
i
get
back
yes
said
dickie
it
was
the
tone
of
an
unwincing
pride
under
the
desk
hidden
from
sight
his
hand
was
a
fist
sheila
passed
on
trailed
by
hudson
who
was
smiling
not
agreeably
to
himself
over
the
smile
he
gave
his
son
a
cruel
look
it
was
as
though
an
enemy
had
said
hurts
you
does
it
dickie
returned
the
look
with
level
eyes
the
rockers
on
the
piazza
stopped
rocking
stopped
talking
stopped
breathing
it
would
seem
to
watch
sylvester
help
sheila
into
his
car
not
that
he
helped
her
greatly
she
had
an
appearance
of
melting
through
his
hands
and
getting
into
her
place
beside
his
by
a
sort
of
sleight
of
body
he
made
a
series
of
angular
movements
smiled
at
her
and
started
the
car
well
little
girl
said
he
where
to
this
afternoon
when
sheila
rode
her
pony
she
always
rode
toward
the
hill
but
in
that
direction
she
had
never
allowed
sylvester
to
take
her
she
looked
vaguely
through
the
now
and
said
anywhere
that
cañon
the
one
we
came
home
by
last
week
it
was
so
queer
it
be
dern
dusty
i
afraid
i
do
care
sheila
wrapped
her
gray
veil
over
her
small
hat
which
fitted
close
about
her
face
i
getting
used
to
the
dust
does
it
ever
rain
around
millings
and
does
it
ever
stop
blowing
we
do
like
millings
do
we
sylvester
was
bending
his
head
to
peer
through
the
gray
mist
of
her
veil
she
held
herself
stiffly
beside
him
showing
the
profile
of
a
small
sphinx
suddenly
it
turned
slightly
seemed
to
wince
back
girlie
at
the
gate
of
number
cottonwood
avenue
had
stopped
to
watch
them
pass
girlie
did
not
speak
her
face
looked
smitten
the
ripe
fruit
had
turned
bitter
upon
her
ruddy
lips
the
tranquil
emptiness
of
her
beauty
had
filled
itself
stormily
sheila
did
not
answer
hudson
reproachful
question
she
leaned
back
dropped
back
rather
into
a
tired
little
heap
and
let
the
country
slide
by
the
strange
wide
broken
country
with
its
circling
mesas
its
somber
grays
and
browns
and
dusty
greens
its
bare
purple
hills
rocks
and
sand
and
golden
dirt
and
now
and
then
in
the
sudden
valley
bottoms
swaying
groves
of
vivid
green
and
ribbons
of
emerald
meadows
the
mountains
shifted
and
opened
their
cañons
gave
a
glimpse
of
their
beckoning
and
forbidding
fastnesses
and
closed
them
again
as
though
by
a
whispered
sesame
what
was
the
row
last
night
asked
sylvester
in
his
voice
of
cracked
tenderness
carthy
says
there
was
a
bunch
of
toughs
were
you
scared
good
and
plenty
i
sorry
it
do
happen
often
believe
i
wish
you
could
heard
carthy
talkin
about
you
sheila
went
on
sylvester
his
eyes
filled
with
uneasiness
studying
her
silence
and
her
huddled
smallness
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
light
coat
veiled
face
turned
a
little
away
say
that
would
set
you
up
all
right
talk
about
beacons
here
she
flashed
round
on
him
as
though
her
whole
body
had
been
electrified
tell
me
all
that
again
she
begged
in
a
voice
that
he
could
not
interpret
except
that
there
was
in
it
a
sound
of
tears
tell
me
again
about
a
beacon
he
stammered
he
was
confused
but
stumblingly
he
tried
to
fulfill
her
demand
here
was
a
thirst
for
something
and
he
wanted
above
everything
in
the
world
to
satisfy
it
sheila
listened
to
him
with
unsteady
parted
lips
he
could
see
them
through
the
veil
you
still
think
i
am
that
she
asked
he
was
eager
to
prove
it
to
her
still
think
still
think
why
girl
i
do
hev
to
think
do
the
tillbox
speak
for
itself
do
carthy
handle
a
crowd
that
growing
under
his
eyes
do
we
sell
more
booze
in
a
week
now
than
we
used
to
in
a
suddenly
he
realized
that
he
was
on
the
wrong
tack
it
was
his
first
break
he
drew
in
a
sharp
breath
and
stopped
his
face
flushing
deeply
yes
questioned
sheila
melting
her
syllables
like
slivers
of
ice
on
her
tongue
go
on
er
er
do
we
draw
a
finer
lot
of
fellows
than
we
ever
did
before
do
they
behave
more
decent
and
orderly
do
they
get
civilization
just
for
looking
at
you
miss
sheila
and
and
booze
jim
greely
for
instance
james
greely
of
the
millings
national
bank
he
never
used
to
patronize
the
aura
and
now
there
every
night
till
twelve
and
often
later
for
he
wo
obey
me
any
more
i
wonder
whether
and
greely
are
glad
that
you
are
getting
a
better
type
of
customer
greely
almost
stopped
me
on
the
street
the
other
day
that
is
she
almost
got
up
courage
to
speak
to
me
before
now
she
cut
me
just
as
girlie
does
just
as
your
wife
does
just
as
dickie
does
dickie
cut
you
sylvester
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
uneasily
and
with
a
strained
note
of
alarm
that
a
good
one
miss
sheila
i
kinder
fancied
you
did
the
cuttin
there
dickie
has
spoken
to
me
since
he
came
to
me
that
day
when
he
heard
what
i
was
going
to
do
and
tried
to
talk
me
out
of
doing
it
yes
he
came
to
me
first
drawled
sylvester
they
were
both
silent
busy
with
the
amazing
memory
of
dickie
of
his
disheveled
fury
of
his
lashing
eloquence
he
had
burst
in
upon
his
family
at
breakfast
that
april
morning
when
millings
was
humming
with
the
news
had
advanced
upon
his
father
stood
above
him
is
it
true
that
you
are
going
to
make
a
barmaid
of
sheila
sylvester
in
an
effort
to
get
to
his
feet
had
been
held
back
by
dickie
thin
hand
that
shot
out
at
him
like
a
sword
sure
it
true
sylvester
had
said
coolly
but
he
had
not
felt
cool
he
had
felt
shaken
and
confused
the
boy
entire
his
entire
absence
of
fear
had
made
hudson
feel
that
he
was
talking
to
a
stranger
a
not
inconsiderable
one
it
true
then
dickie
had
drawn
a
big
breath
you
you
he
seemed
to
swallow
an
epithet
you
let
that
girl
go
into
your
filthy
saloon
and
make
money
for
you
by
her
by
her
prettiness
and
her
her
ignorance
say
dickie
his
father
had
drawled
you
goin
to
run
for
the
legislature
such
a
lot
of
classy
words
but
anger
and
alarm
were
rising
in
him
you
fetched
her
away
out
here
went
on
dickie
and
kinder
got
her
cornered
and
you
talked
a
lot
of
slush
to
her
and
you
here
girlie
came
to
the
rescue
well
anyway
she
a
willing
victim
dickie
girlie
had
said
dickie
had
flashed
her
one
look
is
she
i
see
about
that
where
sheila
and
then
there
was
sheila
memory
dickie
had
come
upon
her
in
a
confusion
of
boxes
her
little
trunk
its
treasures
scattered
over
the
chairs
and
floor
sheila
had
lifted
to
him
from
where
she
knelt
a
glowing
and
excited
face
oh
dickie
she
had
said
her
relief
at
the
escape
from
hudson
pouring
music
into
her
voice
have
you
heard
he
had
sat
down
on
one
of
the
plush
chairs
of
the
suite
as
though
he
felt
weak
then
he
had
got
up
and
had
walked
to
and
fro
while
she
described
her
dream
the
beauty
of
her
chosen
mission
the
glory
of
the
saloon
whose
high
priestess
she
had
become
and
dickie
had
listened
with
the
bitter
and
disillusioned
and
tender
face
of
a
father
hearing
the
prattle
of
a
beloved
child
you
honest
think
all
that
sheila
he
had
asked
her
patiently
she
had
started
again
standing
now
to
face
him
and
beginning
to
be
angry
at
his
look
this
boy
whom
she
had
lifted
up
to
be
her
friend
say
dickie
had
drawled
poppa
some
guardian
he
had
advanced
upon
her
as
though
he
wanted
to
shake
her
you
got
ta
give
it
right
up
sheila
he
had
said
sternly
sooner
than
immediately
it
not
to
go
through
say
girl
you
do
know
much
about
bars
he
had
drawn
a
picture
for
her
drawing
partly
upon
experience
partly
upon
his
imagination
the
gift
of
vivid
metaphor
descending
upon
him
he
used
words
that
bit
into
her
memory
sheila
had
listened
and
then
she
had
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
he
pulled
them
down
he
went
on
sheila
irish
blood
had
boiled
up
into
her
brain
she
stormed
back
at
him
it
you
it
your
use
of
the
aura
that
has
been
its
only
shame
dickie
was
the
last
of
all
the
things
she
had
said
at
which
dickie
standing
very
still
had
answered
if
you
go
there
and
stand
behind
the
bar
all
night
with
carthy
to
keep
hands
off
i
i
swear
i
never
set
foot
inside
the
place
again
you
ai
agoin
to
be
beacon
light
well
then
said
sheila
i
shall
have
done
one
good
thing
at
least
by
being
there
dickie
going
out
had
passed
a
breathless
sylvester
on
his
way
in
the
two
had
looked
at
each
other
with
a
look
that
cut
in
two
the
tie
between
them
and
sheila
running
to
sylvester
had
burst
into
tears
the
motor
hummed
evenly
on
its
way
it
began
with
a
change
of
tune
to
climb
the
graded
side
of
one
of
the
enormous
mesas
sheila
having
lived
through
again
that
scene
with
dickie
took
out
a
small
handkerchief
and
busied
herself
with
it
under
her
veil
she
laughed
shakily
perhaps
a
beacon
does
more
good
by
warning
people
away
than
by
attracting
them
she
said
dickie
has
certainly
kept
his
word
i
believe
he
touched
a
drop
since
i
been
barmaid
hudson
i
should
think
you
be
proud
of
him
sylvester
was
silent
while
they
climbed
the
hill
he
changed
gears
and
sounded
his
horn
they
passed
another
motor
on
a
dangerous
curve
they
began
to
drop
down
again
some
day
said
sylvester
in
a
quiet
voice
i
break
every
bone
in
dickie
body
he
murmured
something
more
under
his
breath
in
too
low
a
tone
fortunately
for
sheila
ear
from
her
position
behind
the
bar
she
had
become
used
to
swearing
she
had
heard
a
strange
variety
of
language
but
when
sylvester
drew
upon
his
experience
and
his
fancy
the
artist
in
him
was
at
work
do
you
suppose
asked
his
companion
in
an
impersonal
tone
that
it
was
really
a
hard
thing
for
dickie
to
do
to
give
it
up
i
mean
by
the
look
of
him
the
last
few
months
snarled
sylvester
i
should
say
it
had
taken
out
of
him
what
little
real
feller
there
ever
was
in
sheila
considered
this
she
remembered
dickie
as
he
had
risen
behind
the
desk
half
an
hour
before
she
did
not
contradict
sylvester
she
had
learned
not
to
contradict
him
but
dickie
face
with
its
look
of
battle
stood
out
very
clear
to
refute
the
accusation
of
any
loss
of
manliness
he
was
still
a
quaint
and
ruffled
dickie
but
he
was
vastly
aged
from
twenty
to
he
seemed
to
have
jumped
in
a
few
weeks
a
key
had
turned
in
the
formerly
open
door
of
his
spirit
the
indeterminate
lips
had
shut
hard
the
eyes
had
definitely
put
a
guard
upon
their
dreams
he
was
shockingly
thin
and
colorless
however
sheila
dwelt
painfully
upon
the
sort
of
devastation
she
had
wrought
girlie
face
and
dickie
and
jim
a
grieving
pressure
squeezed
her
heart
she
lifted
her
chest
with
an
effort
on
a
stifled
breath
god
sheila
said
sylvester
harshly
the
car
wobbled
a
little
you
happy
girl
sheila
looked
up
at
him
her
veil
was
wet
against
her
cheeks
last
night
she
said
unevenly
a
man
was
going
to
kiss
me
on
my
mouth
and
and
he
changed
his
mind
and
kissed
my
hand
instead
he
left
a
smear
of
blood
on
my
fingers
from
where
those
those
other
men
had
struck
his
lips
i
do
know
why
it
me
so
to
think
about
that
but
it
does
she
seemed
to
collapse
before
him
into
a
little
sobbing
child
and
every
day
when
i
wake
up
she
wailed
i
whiskey
on
my
tongue
and
i
i
smell
cigarette
smoke
in
my
hair
and
i
about
men
looking
at
me
the
way
jim
looks
and
i
ca
let
myself
think
of
father
any
more
he
used
to
hold
his
chin
up
and
walk
along
as
if
he
looked
above
every
one
and
everything
i
do
believe
he
ever
seen
a
barmaid
or
a
drunken
man
not
really
seen
them
mr
hudson
then
he
was
a
real
artist
after
all
sylvester
spoke
slowly
and
carefully
he
was
pale
he
the
stars
sobbed
sheila
her
broken
reserve
had
let
out
a
flood
he
told
me
to
keep
looking
at
the
stars
well
sylvester
spoke
again
i
never
knowed
the
stars
to
turn
their
backs
on
anything
barmaids
or
drunks
or
kings
they
all
look
about
alike
to
the
stars
i
reckon
say
sheila
maybe
you
have
got
the
pluck
for
real
living
maybe
you
the
kind
of
girl
that
craves
sheltering
i
reckon
i
made
a
big
mistake
sheila
moved
slightly
as
though
his
speech
had
pricked
her
it
kind
of
did
occur
to
me
went
on
sylvester
that
you
care
a
whole
lot
about
being
by
momma
and
and
greely
and
girlie
say
girlie
got
to
take
her
chance
same
anybody
else
why
do
you
give
jim
a
jolt
sheila
at
this
began
to
laugh
she
caught
her
breath
she
laughed
and
cried
together
sylvester
patted
her
shoulder
poor
kid
you
all
in
late
hours
too
much
for
you
i
reckon
come
on
now
tell
pap
everything
ease
off
your
heart
it
wonderful
what
crying
does
for
the
nervous
system
i
laid
out
on
a
prairie
one
night
when
i
was
about
your
age
and
just
naturally
bawled
you
thought
i
was
a
baby
steer
hanged
if
you
would
thought
so
it
the
fight
scared
you
plumb
to
pieces
carthy
told
me
about
it
and
how
you
let
the
kid
out
by
the
back

off
toward
hidden
creek
this
morning
he
was
a
real
pretty
boy
too
say
sheila
was
you
ever
kissed
no
said
sheila
and
i
do

sylvester
laughed
with
a
little
low
cackle
of
intense
pleasure
and
amusement
well
you
be
no
you
sha
nobody
shall
kiss
sheila
his
method
seemed
to
him
successful
sheila
stopped
crying
and
stopped
laughing
dried
her
eyes
murmured
i
all
right
now
thank
you
hudson
and
fell
into
an
abysmal
silence
he
talked
smoothly
soothingly
skillfully
confident
of
his
power
to
manage
gels
once
in
a
while
he
saw
her
teeth
gleam
as
though
she
smiled
as
they
came
back
to
millings
in
the
afterglow
of
a
brief
western
twilight
she
unfastened
her
veil
and
showed
a
quiet
thoughtful
face
she
thanked
him
gave
him
her
hand
do
come
up
please
hudson
she
said
with
that
cool
composure
of
which
at
times
she
was
surprisingly
capable
i
shall
have
my
dinner
sent
up
and
take
a
little
rest
before
i
go
to
work
you
feel
he
asked
her
doubtfully
his
brown
eyes
had
an
almost
doglike
wistfulness
quite
thank
you
her
easy
effortless
smile
passed
across
her
face
and
in
and
out
of
her
eyes
hudson
stood
beside
his
wheel
tapping
his
teeth
and
staring
after
her
the
rockers
on
the
veranda
stopped
their
rocking
stopped
their
talking
stopped
their
breathing
to
see
sheila
pass
when
she
had
gone
they
fastened
their
attention
upon
sylvester
he
was
not
aware
of
them
he
stood
there
a
full
three
minutes
under
the
glare
of
publicity
then
he
sighed
and
climbed
into
his
car
chapter
xii
hudson
queen
the
lobby
empty
of
its
crowd
when
sheila
passed
through
it
on
her
way
up
to
her
rooms
was
filled
by
a
wheezy
bullying
voice
in
front
of
the
desk
a
little
barrel
of
a
man
with
piggish
eyes
was
disputing
his
bill
with
dickie
at
the
sound
of
sheila
entrance
he
turned
stopped
his
complaint
watched
her
pass
and
spat
into
a
receptacle
sheila
remembered
that
he
had
visited
the
bar
early
in
the
evening
before
and
had
guzzled
his
whiskey
and
made
some
wheezy
attempts
at
gallantry
dickie
flushed
his
hair
at
wild
odds
with
composure
was
going
over
the
bill
in
the
midst
of
his
calculations
the
man
would
interrupt
him
with
a
plump
dirty
forefinger
pounced
upon
the
paper
wassa

of
this

meanin
of
it
my
wife
take
breakfast
in
her
room
i
like
to
see
her
try
it
sheila
went
upstairs
she
took
off
her
things
washed
off
the
dust
and
changed
into
the
barmaid
costume
fastening
the
frilly
apron
the
cuffs
the
delicate
fichu
with
mechanical
care
she
put
on
the
silk
stockings
and
the
buckled
shoes
and
the
tiny
cap
then
she
went
into
her
chose
the
most
dignified
chair
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
waited
for
dickie
waiting
she
looked
out
through
the
window
and
saw
the
glow
fade
from
the
snowy
crest
of
the
hill
the
evening
star
let
itself
delicately
down
through
the
sweeping
shadows
of
the
earth
from
some
mysterious
fastness
of
invisibility
the
room
was
dim
when
dickie
knock
made
her
turn
her
head
come
in
he
appeared
shut
the
door
without
looking
at
her
then
came
unwillingly
across
the
carpet
and
stopped
at
about
three
steps
from
her
chair
standing
with
one
hand
in
his
pocket
he
had
slicked
down
his
hair
with
a
wet
brush
and
changed
his
suit
it
was
the
serge
he
had
worn
at
the
dance
five
months
before
what
those
five
months
had
been
to
dickie
through
what
abasements
and
exaltations
furies
and
despairs
he
had
traveled
since
he
had
looked
up
from
sheila
slippered
feet
with
his
heart
turned
backward
like
a
pilot
wheel
was
only
faintly
indicated
in
his
face
and
yet
the
face
gave
sheila
a
pang
and
unsupported
by
anger
he
was
far
from
formidable
a
mere
youth
sheila
wondered
at
her
long
and
sustained
persecution
of
him
she
smiled
her
lips
her
eyes
and
her
heart
are
you
going
to
sit
down
dickie
this
is
a
school
examination
if
it
was
said
dickie
with
an
uncertain
attempt
at
ease
i
pass
he
felt
for
a
chair
and
got
into
it
he
caught
a
knee
in
his
hand
and
looked
about
him
you
made
the
room
awful
pretty
sheila
she
had
spent
some
of
the
rather
large
pay
she
drew
upon
coverings
of
french
blue
for
the
plush
furniture
upon
a
dainty
yellow
porcelain
upon
little
oddments
of
decoration
the
and
carpet
were
inoffensive
the
quietest
probably
in
millings
so
that
her
efforts
had
met
with
some
success
there
was
a
lounge
with
cushions
there
were
some
little
volumes
a
picture
of
her
father
a
bowl
of
pink
wild
roses
a
vase
of
vivid
cactus
flowers
some
sketches
in
most
happy
medium
had
been
tacked
up
a
piece
of
tapestry
decorated
the
back
of
the
chair
sheila
had
chosen
in
the
dim
light
it
all
had
an
air
of
quiet
richness
it
seemed
a
room
transplanted
to
millings
from
some
finer
soil
dickie
looked
at
the
tapestry
because
it
was
the
nearest
he
dared
come
to
looking
at
sheila
his
hands
and
knees
shook
with
the
terrible
beating
of
his
heart
it
was
not
right
thought
dickie
resentfully
that
any
feeling
should
take
hold
of
a
fellow
and
shake
and
terrify
him
so
he
threw
himself
back
suddenly
and
folded
his
arms
tight
across
his
chest
you
wanted
to
see
me
about
something
he
asked
yes
i
give
you
some
tea
first
dickie
lips
fell
apart
he
said
neither
yea
nor
nay
but
watched
dazedly
her
preparations
her
concoctions
her
advance
upon
him
with
a
yellow
teacup
and
a
wafer
he
did
not
stand
up
to
take
it
and
he
knew
too
late
that
this
was
a
blunder
he
tingled
with
shame
sheila
went
back
to
her
chair
and
sipped
from
her
own
cup
i
been
angry
with
you
for
three
months
now
dickie
yes
he
said
meekly
that
the
longest
i
ever
been
angry
with
any
one
in
my
life
once
i
hated
a
teacher
for
two
weeks
and
it
almost
killed
me
but
what
i
felt
about
her
was
was
weakness
to
the
way
i
felt
about
you
yes
again
said
dickie
his
tea
was
terribly
hot
and
burnt
his
tongue
so
that
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
i
suppose
you
been
angry
with
me
no
sheila
was
not
particularly
pleased
with
this
gentle
reply
why
dickie
you
you
have
no
then
why
have
you
spoken
to
me
why
have
you
looked
that
way
at
me
i
do
speak
to
folks
that
do
speak
to
me
said
dickie
lifting
the
wafer
as
though
its
extreme
lightness
was
faintly
repulsive
to
him
well
said
sheila
bitterly
you
have
been
alone
in
your
attitude
very
few
people
have
been
speaking
to
me
my
only
loyal
friends
are
hudson
and
amelia
plecks
and
carthy
and
jim
jim
made
no
promises
about
being
my
guardian
but
but
he
your
guardian
dickie
drawled
the
question
slightly
his
gift
of
faint
irony
and
impersonal
detachment
flicked
sheila
temper
as
it
had
always
flicked
his
father
jim
is
my
friend
sheila
maintained
in
defiance
of
a
still
small
voice
he
has
given
me
a
pony
and
has
taken
me
riding
yes
i
saw
you
dickie
english
was
peculiarly
fallible
in
moments
of
emotion
now
he
seemed
determined
to
cut
sheila
description
short
say
sheila
did
you
send
for
me
to
tell
me
about
this
lovely
friendship
of
yours
with
jim
sheila
set
her
cup
down
on
the
she
did
not
want
to
lose
her
temper
with
dickie
she
brushed
a
wafer
crumb
from
her
knee
no
dickie
i
did
i
sent
for
you
because
after
all
though
been
so
angry
with
you
i
known
in
my
heart
that
that
you
are
a
loyal
friend
and
that
you
tell
the
truth
this
admission
was
an
effort
sheila
pride
suffered
to
the
point
of
bringing
a
dim
sound
of
tears
into
her
voice
dickie
did
not
speak
he
too
put
down
his
and
his
wafer
side
by
side
on
the
floor
near
his
chair
he
put
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
bent
his
head
down
as
though
he
were
examining
his
thin
locked
hands
sheila
waited
for
a
long
minute
then
she
said
angrily
are
you
glad
i
think
that
of
you
yes
dickie
voice
was
indistinct
you
do
seem
glad
dickie
made
some
sort
of
struggle
sheila
could
not
quite
make
out
its
nature
i
glad
i
so
glad
that
it
kind
of
hurts
he
said
oh
that
at
least
was
pleasant
intelligence
to
a
wounded
pride
fortified
sheila
began
the
real
business
of
the
interview
you
are
not
an
artist
dickie
she
said
and
you
do
understand
why
your
father
asked
me
to
work
at
the
aura
nor
why
i
wanted
to
work
there
it
was
your
entire
inability
to
understand
entire
inability
whispered
dickie
as
though
he
were
taking
down
the
phrase
with
an
intention
of
looking
it
up
later
this
confused
sheila
your
your
entire
inability
she
repeated
rapidly
your
your
entire
inability
yes
i
got
that
to
understand
that
made
me
so
angry
that
day
sheila
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
that
obstruction
she
had
planned
this
speech
rather
carefully
in
the
watches
of
the
wakeful
feverish
morning
which
had
been
her
night
you
seemed
to
be
trying
to
pull
your
father
and
me
down
to
some
lower
spiritual
level
of
your
own
lower
spiritual
level
repeated
dickie
dickie
stop
that
please
he
looked
up
startled
by
her
sharpness
stop
what
saying
things
after
me
it
insufferable
insufferable
oh
i
suppose
it
is
you
usin
so
many
words
sheila
i
kind
of
forgot
there
was
so
many
words
as
you
makin
use
of
this
afternoon
oh
dickie
dickie
ca
you
see
how
miserable
i
am
i
am
so
unhappy
and
and
scared
and
you
you
are
making
fun
of
me
at
that
spoken
in
a
changed
and
quavering
key
of
helplessness
dickie
hurried
to
her
knelt
down
beside
her
chair
and
took
her
hands
sheila
i
do
anything
his
presence
his
boyish
quivering
touch
so
withheld
from
anything
but
boyishness
even
the
impulsive
humility
of
his
thin
kneeling
body
were
inexpressibly
soothing
inexpressibly
comforting
she
did
not
draw
away
her
hands
she
let
them
cling
to
his
dickie
will
you
answer
me
quite
truthfully
and
simply
without
any
explaining
or
softening
please
if
i
ask
you
a
a
dreadful
question
yes
dear
i
not
sure
if
it
is
a
dreadful
question
but
but
i
afraid
it
is
do
worry
ask
me
surely
i
answer
you
the
truth
without
any
fixin
her
hands
clung
a
little
closer
she
was
silent
gathering
courage
he
felt
her
slim
knees
quiver
what
do
they
mean
dickie
she
whispered
with
a
wan
look
when
they
call
me
queen
dickie
bent
from
her
look
as
though
he
felt
a
pain
he
took
her
hands
up
close
to
his
breast
who
told
you
that
they
called
you
that
he
asked
breathlessly
that
what
every
one
calls
me
the
men
over
in
the
big
horn
country
they
tell
men
that
are
coming
to
millings
to
be
sure
to
look
up
queen
do
they
mean
the
hotel
dickie
they
mean
the
hotel
do
they
dickie
that
i
am
hudson
queen
the
truth
sometimes
presents
itself
like
a
withering
flame
dickie
got
up
put
away
her
hands
walked
up
and
down
then
came
back
to
her
he
had
heard
the
epithet
and
he
knew
its
meaning
he
wrestled
now
with
his
longing
to
keep
her
from
such
understanding
or
at
least
to
soften
it
she
had
asked
for
the
clear
truth
and
he
had
promised
it
to
her
he
stood
away
because
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
endure
the
wincing
of
her
hands
and
body
when
she
heard
the
truth
he
hoped
dimly
that
she
might
not
understand
it
they
do
mean
the
hotel
sheila
he
said
harshly
they
mean
father
you
know
now
what
they
mean
in
her
stricken
and
bewildered
eyes
he
saw
that
she
did
know
i
would
like
to
kill
them
sobbed
dickie
suddenly
i
would
like
to
kill
no
no
sheila
do
you
cry
do
you
it
not
worth
cryin
for
it
jest
ignorant
folks
ignorant
and
stupid
talk
it
not
worth
cryin
for
he
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
fairly
gathered
her
into
his
arms
he
rocked
and
patted
her
shoulder
and
kissed
her
gently
on
her
hair
all
with
that
boyishness
that
brotherliness
that
vast
restraint
so
that
she
could
not
even
guess
the
strange
and
unimaginable
pangs
he
suffered
from
his
before
dickie
resolution
was
burnt
away
by
the
young
inner
fire
sheila
withdrew
herself
gently
from
his
arms
and
got
up
from
the
chair
she
walked
over
to
one
of
the
two
large
windows
the
sunset
windows
she
called
them
in
contradistinction
to
the
one
sunrise
window
and
stood
composing
herself
her
hands
twisted
together
and
lifted
to
the
top
of
the
lower
sash
her
forehead
rested
on
them
a
rattle
of
china
a
creaking
step
outside
the
door
interrupted
their
tremulous
silence
in
which
who
knows
what
mysterious
currents
were
passing
between
their
young
minds
it
my
dinner
said
sheila
and
dickie
walked
over
mechanically
and
opened
the
door
amelia
plecks
came
panting
into
the
room
set
the
tray
down
on
a
small
table
and
looked
contempt
at
dickie
there
now
miss
arundel
she
said
with
breathless
tenderness
a
dandy
chop
for
you
you
said
you
was
kind
of
famished
for
a
lamb
chop
and
of
course
in
a
sheep
country
good
mutton
real
hard
to
come
by
and
this
ai
properly
speaking
lamb
well
say
just
dandy
meat
she
ignored
dickie
as
one
might
ignore
the
presence
of
some
obnoxious
insect
in
the
of
a
queen
her
eyes
were
disgustedly
fascinated
by
his
presence
but
in
her
conversation
she
would
not
admit
this
preoccupation
of
disgust
i
be
going
said
dickie
amelia
nodded
as
one
who
applauds
the
becoming
move
of
an
inferior
here
a
note
for
you
miss
arundel
she
said
coming
over
to
post
at
the
window
where
she
was
trying
to
hide
the
traces
of
her
tears
well
say
who
been
botherin
you
amelia
voice
went
down
a
long
threatening
octave
to
a
sinister
bass
note
at
the
voicing
of
which
she
turned
to
look
at
dickie
sheila
he
said
diffidently
and
sheila
coming
quickly
toward
him
put
out
her
hand
the
note
amelia
had
handed
her
fell
dickie
and
amelia
both
bent
to
pick
it
up
no
you
do
said
amelia
snatching
it
and
accusing
him
by
her
tone
of
inexpressibly
base
intentions
say
miss
arundel
in
a
whisper
of
thrilled
confidence
uh
thank
you
dickie
murmured
sheila
by
her
adoring
follower
innuendoes
thank
you
for
everything
i
shall
have
to
think
what
i
can
do
dickie
his
eyes
forcibly
held
away
from
jim
note
murmured
and
went
out
closing
the
door
with
exaggerated
gentleness
the
quietness
of
his
departure
seemed
to
spare
sensitiveness
ai
he
a
worm
though
exclaimed
amelia
sparing
sensitiveness
he
nothing
of
the
sort
sheila
protested
indignantly
he
is
a
dear
amelia
opened
her
prominent
eyes
and
pursed
her
lips
a
reassuring
light
dawned
on
her
bewilderment
oh
say
dearie
i
was
speakin
of
your
mister
jim
i
was
makin
reference
to
dickie
sheila
thrust
the
note
into
her
pocket
and
went
over
to
the
table
to
light
her
lamp
i
know
quite
well
that
you
meant
dickie
she
said
nobody
in
millings
would
ever
dream
of
comparing
james
greely
to
a
worm
even
if
he
came
out
from
the
ground
just
in
time
for
the
early
bird
to
peck
him
i
know
that
you
ornery
dearie
announced
amelia
and
with
exemplary
tact
she
creaked
and
breathed
herself
to
the
door
there
she
had
a
relapse
from
tactfulness
however
and
planted
herself
to
stare
you
goin
to
read
your
note
sheila
to
be
rid
of
her
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
it
was
quite
beautifully
penned
in
green
ink
on
violet
paper
jim
had
written
both
wisely
and
too
well
my
darling
why
not
permit
me
to
call
you
that
when
it
is
the
simple
and
sincere
truth
an
astonished
little
voice
in
sheila
brain
here
seemed
to
mechanically
why
not
indeed
i
can
not
think
of
anything
but
you
and
how
i
love
you
these
little
notes
i
am
going
to
keep
you
are
messengers
of
love
you
will
never
meet
with
a
more
tremendous
lover
than
me
be
queen
jim
had
written
with
a
great
climatic
splash
of
ink
and
he
had
signed
himself
your
james
sheila
face
was
crimson
when
she
put
down
the
note
she
stared
straight
in
front
of
her
for
an
instant
with
very
large
eyes
in
this
scarlet
rose
of
countenance
and
then
she
crumpled
into
mirth
she
put
her
face
into
her
hands
and
rocked
it
seemed
as
though
a
giant
of
laughter
had
caught
her
about
the
ribs
amelia
stared
and
felt
a
wound
she
swallowed
a
lump
of
balked
sentiment
as
she
went
out
her
idol
was
faintly
tarnished
her
heroine
stature
preceptibly
diminished
the
sort
of
madame
du
barry
atmosphere
with
which
sheila
image
was
surrounded
in
amelia
fancy
lost
a
little
of
its
rosy
glow
the
favorite
of
kings
the
of
dukes
does
not
rock
with
laughter
over
scented
notes
from
a
high
desirable
she
ai
just
quite
up
to
it
was
amelia
comment
which
she
probably
could
not
have
explained
even
to
herself
sheila
presently
was
done
with
laughter
she
ate
a
nibble
of
dinner
as
soberly
as
amelia
could
have
wished
then
sat
back
her
eyes
closed
with
a
resolve
to
think
clearly
closely
to
some
determination
of
her
life
but
jim
note
which
had
so
roused
her
amusement
began
to
force
itself
in
another
fashion
upon
her
she
discovered
that
it
was
an
insufferable
note
it
insinuated
everything
it
suggested
everything
it
was
a
boastful
messenger
it
swaggered
it
threw
out
its
chest
and
smacked
its
lips
see
what
a
sad
dog
my
master
is
it
said
a
regular
devil
of
a
fellow
sheila
found
her
thoughts
confused
by
anger
she
found
that
she
was
too
disturbed
for
any
clear
decision
she
was
terribly
weary
and
full
of
dread
for
the
long
night
before
her
and
a
startled
look
at
her
clock
told
her
it
was
time
now
to
go
over
to
the
saloon
she
got
up
went
to
her
mirror
smoothed
her
rippled
hair
with
two
strokes
of
a
brush
readjusted
her
cap
and
decided
that
for
once
a
little
powder
on
the
nose
was
a
necessity
carthy
must
not
see
that
she
had
been
crying
as
it
was
her
brilliant
color
was
suspicious
and
her
eyes
with
their
deep
distended
look
of
tears
she
shut
them
drew
a
breath
put
out
her
light
and
went
down
the
back
stairs
to
a
narrow
alley
it
led
from
the
hotel
to
the
street
that
ran
back
of
the
aura
the
street
to
which
she
had
taken
young
hilliard
the
night
before
the
alley
seemed
to
sheila
as
she
stepped
into
it
from
the
glare
of
the
hotel
a
stream
of
cool
and
silvery
light
above
lay
a
strip
of
tender
sky
in
which
already
the
stars
shook
in
this
high
atmosphere
they
were
always
tremulous
dancing
beating
almost
leaping
with
a
fullness
of
quick
light
they
seemed
very
near
to
the
edges
of
the
alley
walls
to
be
especially
visiting
it
with
their
detached
regard
peering
down
for
some
small
divine
occasion
for
influence
sheila
prayed
to
them
a
desperate
prayer
of
human
helplessness
chapter
xiii
sylvester
celebrates
hey
you
girl
there
hi
hey
these
exclamations
called
in
a
resonant
voice
succeeded
at
last
in
attracting
sheila
attention
she
had
lingered
at
the
mouth
shirking
her
entrance
into
the
saloon
and
now
she
saw
halfway
down
the
short
wide
street
a
gesticulating
figure
at
first
as
she
obeyed
the
summons
she
thought
the
summoner
a
man
but
on
near
view
it
proved
itself
a
woman
of
broad
massive
hips
and
shoulders
dressed
in
a
man
flannel
shirt
and
a
pair
of
large
corduroy
trousers
their
legs
tucked
into
high
cowboy
boots
she
wore
no
hat
and
her
hair
was
cut
square
across
her
neck
and
forehead
hair
of
a
dark
rusty
red
it
was
and
matched
eyes
like
dark
panes
of
glass
before
a
fire
and
very
bright
ruddy
eyes
in
a
square
ruddy
face
which
with
its
short
straight
nose
lips
square
chin
and
brilliant
teeth
made
up
a
striking
and
not
unattractive
countenance
i
got
a
horse
here
wo
stand
said
the
woman
will
you
hold
his
head
can
leaking
back
here
in
my
wagon
leaking
all
over
my
other
stuff
the
horse
came
round
the
corner
he
moved
resolutely
to
meet
them
he
was
the
boniest
small
horse
sheila
had
ever
seen
a
shadow
of
a
horse
morose
embittered
the
harness
hung
loose
upon
his
meagerness
the
shafts
stuck
up
like
the
points
of
a
large
collar
on
a
small
old
man
he
not
running
away
explained
the
owner
superfluously
it
just
that
he
ca
stop
you
think
to
look
at
him
that
stopping
would
be
his
favorite
sport
but
you
be
mistaken
go
he
must
he
kind
of
always
crazy
to
get
there
lord
knows
where
probably
to
the
end
of
his
life
sheila
held
the
horse
and
rubbed
his
nose
with
her
small
and
gentle
hand
the
creature
drooped
under
the
caress
and
let
its
lower
lip
with
a
few
stiff
white
hairs
hang
and
quiver
bitterly
it
its
one
useful
eye
a
pale
eye
of
intense
colorless
disillusionment
when
the
wagon
stopped
a
dog
who
was
trotting
under
it
stopped
too
and
lay
down
in
the
dust
panting
sheila
bent
her
head
a
little
to
see
the
dog
she
had
a
child
intense
interest
in
animals
through
the
dimness
she
made
out
a
big
wolfish
creature
with
a
splendid
clean
gray
coat
his
pointed
nose
short
pointed
ears
deep
wild
eyes
and
scarlet
tongue
set
in
a
circular
ruff
of
black
his
bushy
tail
curled
up
over
his
back
what
kind
of
dog
is
that
asked
sheila
thinking
the
great
animal
under
the
wagon
better
fitted
to
pull
the
load
than
the
shadowy
little
horse
in
front
of
it
quarter
wolf
answered
the
woman
in
her
casual
manner
of
speech
her
resonant
voice
falling
pleasantly
on
the
light
coolness
of
the
evening
air
malamute
this
fellow
was
littered
on
the
body
of
a
dead
man
sheila
had
also
the
child
interest
in
tales
tell
me
about
it
she
begged
fervently
the
woman
stopped
in
her
business
of
tying
down
a
canvas
cover
over
her
load
and
gave
sheila
an
amused
and
searching
look
she
held
an
iron
spike
between
her
teeth
but
spoke
around
it
skillfully
arctic
exploration
it
was
my
brother
was
one
of
the
party
was
he
brought
me
home
berg
berg
mother
was
one
of
the
sledge
dogs
party
was
shipwrecked
starved
most
of
the
dogs
eaten
one
man
dead
berg
mother
littered
on
the
body
one
night
next
morning
they
were
rescued
and
the
new
family
was
saved
otherwise
i
guess
they
have
had
a
puppy
stew
and
berg
and
his
wife
and
family
would
be
earning
their
living
with
me
how
do
they
earn
their
living
asked
sheila
still
peering
at
the
hero
of
the
tale
they
pull
my
sled
about
winters
hidden
creek
oh
you
live
in
the
hidden
creek
country
yes
got
a
ranch
up
not
far
from
the
source
ever
been
over
the
hill
she
came
toward
sheila
gathered
the
reins
into
her
strong
broad
hands
held
them
in
her
teeth
and
began
to
pull
on
her
canvas
gloves
she
talked
with
the
reins
between
her
teeth
as
she
had
with
the
spike
her
enunciation
triumphantly
forceful
and
distinct
some
day
i
coming
over
the
hill
said
sheila
less
successful
with
a
contraction
in
her
throat
the
woman
made
a
few
strides
now
she
was
looking
shrewdly
close
into
sheila
face
you
a
at
the
hotel
no
i
work
in
the
saloon
in
the
saloon
oh
sure
barmaid
i
heard
of
you
here
she
put
a
square
under
sheila
chin
and
looked
even
closer
than
before
not
happy
are
you
she
said
she
moved
away
abruptly
tired
of
town
life
been
crying
well
when
you
want
to
pull
out
come
over
to
my
ranch
i
need
a
girl
i
kind
of
lonesome
winters
it
a
pretty
place
if
you
are
looking
for
and
you
do
hear
much
more
than
coyotes
and
the
river
and
the
pines
and
if
you
looking
for
high
lights
you
can
sure
see
the
stars
she
climbed
up
to
her
seat
using
the
hub
of
her
wheel
for
a
foothold
and
springing
with
surprising
agility
and
strength
sheila
stepped
aside
and
the
horse
started
instantly
she
made
a
few
hurried
steps
to
keep
up
thank
you
she
said
looking
up
into
the
ruddy
eyes
that
looked
down
i
remember
that
what
is
your
name
christina
blake
miss
blake
i
make
the
hill
before
morning
if
i
lucky
less
dust
and
heat
by
night
and
the
horse
has
loafed
since
morning
i
mean
that
about
coming
to
my
place
any
time
to
you
she
smiled
a
smile
as
casual
in
its
own
way
as
sheila
own
berg
under
the
wagon
trotted
silently
he
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
his
wild
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
heels
of
the
small
horse
he
looked
as
though
he
were
trotting
relentlessly
toward
some
wolfish
goal
of
satisfied
hunger
a
little
cloud
of
dust
rose
up
from
the
wheels
and
stood
between
sheila
and
the
wagon
she
conquered
an
impulse
to
run
after
it
shut
her
hand
tight
and
walked
in
at
the
back
door
of
the
saloon
a
teamster
with
a
lean
fatherly
face
his
mouth
veiled
by
a
shaggy
blond
mustache
his
eyes
as
blue
as
larkspur
smiled
at
her
across
the
bar
hullo
said
he
how
your
pony
sheila
had
struck
up
one
of
her
sudden
friendships
with
this
man
who
visited
the
saloon
at
regular
intervals
this
question
warmed
her
heart
the
little
pony
of
jim
giving
was
dear
she
thought
of
his
soft
eyes
and
snuggling
nose
almost
as
often
and
as
fondly
as
a
lover
thinks
of
the
face
of
his
lady
tuck
splendid
thatcher
she
said
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
bar
and
cupping
her
chin
in
her
hands
her
face
was
bright
with
its
tender
puckish
look
he
too
cute
he
can
take
sugar
out
of
my
apron
pocket
and
he
shake
hands
i
just
love
you
to
see
him
will

be
here

i
pullin
out
about
sunup
round
the
time

to
make
the
hill
how
your
baby
a
shining
smile
rewarded
her
interest
in
the
recent
invalid
fine
and
dandy
you
ought
to
see
her
walk
is
that
splendid
and
how
the
little
boy

to
make
hidden
creek
this
trip
though
say
he
was
set
on
seein
you
i
told
him
about
you
sheila
face
flamed
and
her
eyes
smarted
gratitude
and
shame
possessed
her
this
man
then
did
not
speak
of
her
as
hudson
queen
not
if
he
told
his
boy
about
her
she
turned
away
to
hide
the
flame
and
smart
when
she
looked
back
sylvester
himself
stood
at
thatcher
elbow
he
very
rarely
came
into
the
saloon
at
sight
of
him
sheila
heart
leaped
as
though
it
had
been
struck
say
sheila
he
murmured
i
celebratin
she
tried
to
dismiss
from
her
mind
its
new
and
ugly
consciousness
she
tried
to
smile
the
result
was
an
expression
strange
enough
sylvester
however
missed
it
he
was
dressed
in
one
of
the
brown
checked
suits
a
new
one
freshly
creased
there
was
a
red
bud
in
his
buttonhole
the
emerald
gleamed
on
his
sallow
hand
he
was
sipping
from
his
glass
and
had
put
a
confidential
hand
on
shoulder
he
grinned
at
carthy
well

he
said

my
celebration
but
not
proud
i

celebratin

thatcher

carthy
hates
to

and
he
mostly
right
in
his
he
sure
is
you
bet
yer
that
why
i
so
festive
what
he
prognosticate
asked
thatcher
obligingly
he
had
moved
his
shoulder
away
from
hudson
hand
sylvester
wrinkled
his
upper
lip
into
its
smile
and
looked
down
into
his
glass
he
turned
his
emerald
carthy
prophesied
that
about
this
time
a
little
er
dream
of
mine
would
go
bust
said
hudson
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
pensively
to
sheila
first
his
eyes
and
then
his
glass
here
to
my
dream
you
girl
he
said
softly
he
drank
with
his
eyes
upon
her
face
drew
a
deep
breath
and
looked
about
the
room
thatcher
glanced
from
him
to
sheila
goodnight
to
you
he
said
with
gentleness
next
time
i
bring
the
boy
please
please
do
sheila
put
her
hand
in
his
he
looked
down
at
it
as
though
something
had
startled
him
in
fact
her
touch
was
like
a
flake
of
snow
when
thatcher
had
gone
sylvester
leaned
closer
to
her
across
the
bar
he
moved
his
glass
around
in
his
hand
and
looked
up
at
her
humbly
the
tables
kind
of
turned
eh
he
said
what
do
you
mean
mr
hudson
sheila
by
lifting
her
voice
tried
to
dissipate
the
atmosphere
of
confidence
of
secrecy
carthy
had
moved
away
from
them
the
other
occupants
of
the
saloon
were
very
apparently
not
listening
well
sylvester
explained
six
months
ago
i
was
kind
of
claim
to
gratitude
from
you
and
now
it
the
other
way
round
yes
she
said
but
i
am
still
grateful
the
words
came
however
with
a
certain
unwillingness
a
certain
lack
of
spontaneity
are
you
though
he
put
his
head
on
one
side
so
that
sheila
was
reminded
of
dickie
for
the
first
time
a
sort
of
shadowy
resemblance
between
father
and
son
was
apparent
to
her
well
you
wiped
the
reckonin
off
the
slate
by
what
you
done
for
me
you
given
me
my
aura
say
you
have
been
my
fairy
godmother
all
right
talk
about
wishes
comin
true
again
he
looked
about
the
room
and
that
wistfulness
of
the
visionary
stole
into
his
face
his
eyes
came
back
to
her
with
an
expression
that
was
almost
beautiful
if
only
that
englishman
was
here
he
sighed
yes
i
sure
celebratin
it
was
soon
very
apparent
that
he
was
celebrating
for
an
hour
he
stood
every
newcomer
to
a
drink
and
then
he
withdrew
to
a
table
in
a
shadowy
corner
and
sitting
there
tilted
against
the
wall
he
sipped
from
his
glass
smoked
and
dreamed
hour
after
hour
of
the
slow
noisy
night
went
by
and
still
he
sat
there
watching
sheila
through
the
smoke
seeing
in
her
more
and
more
glowingly
the
body
of
his
dream
it
was
after
dawn
when
sheila
touched
carthy
elbow
the
big
irishman
looked
down
at
her
small
drawn
face
carthy
she
whispered
would
it
be
all
right
if
i
went
home
now
it
earlier
than
usual
but
i
so
awfully
tired
there
was
so
urgent
an
air
of
secrecy
in
her
manner
that
carthy
muttered
his
permission
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
sheila
melted
from
his
side
the
alley
that
had
been
silvery
cool
with
dusk
was
now
even
more
silvery
cool
with
morning
twilight
small
sunrise
clouds
were
winging
over
it
like
golden
doves
sheila
did
not
look
at
them
she
ran
breathless
to
her
door
opened
it
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
dickie
chapter
xiv
the
light
of
dawn
there
was
a
light
of
dawn
in
the
room
and
through
the
open
window
blew
in
the
keen
air
of
daybreak
dickie
was
standing
quite
still
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
was
more
neat
and
groomed
than
sheila
had
ever
seen
him
he
looked
as
though
he
had
stepped
from
a
bath
his
hair
was
sleek
and
wet
so
that
it
was
dark
above
the
pure
pallor
of
his
face
his
suit
was
carefully
put
on
his
cuffs
and
collar
were
clean
he
did
not
have
the
look
of
a
man
that
has
been
awake
all
night
nor
did
he
look
as
though
he
had
ever
been
asleep
his
face
and
eyes
were
alight
his
lips
firm
and
delicate
with
feeling
before
him
sheila
felt
old
and
stained
the
smoke
and
fumes
of
the
bar
hung
about
her
she
was
shamed
by
the
fresh
youthfulness
of
his
slender
eager
carriage
and
of
his
eyes
dickie
she
faltered
and
stood
against
the
door
drooping
wearily
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
what
does
the
hour
matter
he
asked
impatiently
come
over
to
the
window
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
big
star
i
been
watching
it
almost
gone
it
like
a
white
bird
flying
straight
into
the
sun
he
was
imperative
laid
his
cool
hand
upon
hers
and
drew
her
to
the
window
they
stood
facing
the
sunrise
why
did
you
come
here
again
asked
sheila
the
beauty
of
the
sky
only
deepened
her
misery
and
shame
because
i
could
wait
any
longer
than
one
night
it
sure
been
an
awful
long
night
for
me
sheila
sheila
he
drew
the
hand
he
still
held
close
to
him
with
a
trembling
touch
and
laid
his
other
hand
over
it
then
she
felt
the
terrible
beating
of
his
heart
felt
that
he
was
shaking
sheila
i
love
you
she
had
hidden
her
face
against
the
curtain
had
turned
from
him
she
felt
nothing
but
weariness
and
shame
she
was
like
a
leaden
weight
tied
coldly
to
his
throbbing
youth
her
hand
under
his
was
hot
and
lifeless
like
a
scorched
rose
i
want
you
to
come
away
with
me
from
millings
you
ca
keep
on
in
that
saloon
you
ca
to
have
folks

and
thinking
the
fool
things
they

and
i
ca

even
if
you
can
i
go
loco
and
kill
sheila
i
been
thinking
all
night
just
sitting
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
and
thinking
sheila
if
you
will
marry
me
i
will
promise
you
to
take
care
of
you
i
wo
let
you
suffer
any
i
will
die
his
voice
rocked
on
the
word
spoken
with
an
awful
sincerity
of
young
love
before
i
let
you
suffer
any
if
you
could
love
me
a
little
bit
he
stopped
as
though
that
leaping
heart
had
sprung
up
into
his
throat
only
a
little
bit
sheila
he
whispered
maybe
i
ca
she
said
i
ca
love
you
that
way
even
a
little
bit
i
ca
marry
you
dickie
i
wish
i
could
i
am
so
tired
she
drew
her
hand
away
or
rather
it
fell
from
the
slackening
grasp
of
his
and
hung
at
her
side
she
looked
up
from
the
curtain
to
his
face
it
was
still
alight
and
tender
and
pale
you
real
sure
sheila
that
you
could
that
you
rather
go
on
with
this
she
pressed
all
the
curves
and
the
color
out
of
her
lips
still
looking
at
him
and
nodded
her
head
i
ca
stay
in
millings
dickie
said
and
work
in
poppa
hotel
and
watch
this
sheila
unless
some
way
i
can
help
you
then
you
better
go
she
said
lifelessly
because
i
ca
see
what
else
there
is
for
me
to
do
oh
i
sha
go
on
with
it
for
very
long
of
course
he
came
an
eager
nearer
then
anyway
you
let
me
go
away
and
work
and
when
i
kind
of
got
a
start
you
let
me
come
back
and
and
see
if
if
you
feel
any
sort
of
different
from
what
you
do
now
it
would
be
so
awful
long
i
work
like
like
hell
his
thin
hand
shot
into
a
fist
sheila
lassitude
was
startled
by
his
word
into
a
faint
unwilling
smile
do
laugh
at
me
he
cried
out
oh
dickie
my
dear
i
not
laughing
i
so
tired
i
can
hardly
stand
and
truly
you
must
go
now
i
horrid
to
you
i
always
am
and
yet
i
do
like
you
so
much
and
you
are
such
a
dear
and
i
feel
there
something
great
about
you
i
should
be
glad
for
you
to
leave
millings
there
is
a
much
better
chance
for
you
away
from
millings
i
feel
years
old
i
think
i
grown
up
too
old
all
at
once
and
missed
lovely
things
that
i
ought
to
have
had
dickie
she
gave
a
dry
sort
of
sob
are
one
of
the
lovely
things
his
arms
drew
gently
round
her
let
me
kiss
you
sheila
he
pleaded
with
tremulous
lips
i
want
just
to
kiss
you
once
for
i
be
so
careful
if
you
knowed
how
i
feel
you
let
me
she
lifted
up
her
mouth
like
an
obedient
child
then
back
of
dickie
she
saw
sylvester
face
it
was
more
sallow
than
usual
its
upper
lip
was
drawn
away
from
the
teeth
and
deeply
wrinkled
the
eyes
were
very
soft
they
looked
as
though
there
was
a
veil
across
their
pensiveness
he
caught
dickie
elbow
in
his
hand
twisted
him
about
thrusting
a
knee
into
his
back
and
with
his
other
long
bony
hand
he
struck
him
brutally
across
the
face
the
emerald
on
his
finger
caught
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
and
flashed
like
a
little
stream
of
green
fire
dickie
caught
unawares
by
superior
strength
was
utterly
defenseless
he
writhed
and
struggled
vainly
gasping
under
the
blows
sylvester
forced
him
across
the
room
still
inflicting
punishment
his
hand
made
a
great
cracking
sound
at
every
slap
sheila
hid
her
face
from
the
dreadful
sight
oh
do
do
do
she
wailed
again
and
again
then
it
was
over
dickie
was
flung
out
the
door
was
locked
against
him
and
sylvester
came
back
across
the
floor
his
collar
stood
up
in
a
back
of
his
ears
his
hair
fell
across
his
forehead
his
face
was
flushed
his
lip
bled
he
had
either
bitten
it
himself
or
dickie
had
struck
it
but
he
seemed
quite
calm
only
a
little
breathless
he
was
neither
snarling
nor
smiling
now
he
took
sheila
very
gently
by
the
wrists
drawing
her
hands
down
from
her
face
and
he
put
her
arms
at
their
full
length
behind
her
holding
them
there
you
meet
dickie
here
when
you
through
work
he
said
gently
you
kiss
dickie
when
you
leave
my
aura
you
little
beacon
light
i
kept
my
hands
off
you
and
my
lips
off
you
and
my
mind
off
you
because
i
thought
you
were
too
fine
and
good
for
anything
but
my
ideal
and
all
this
while
you
been
sneaking
up
here
to
dickie
and
jim
and
lord
knows
who
else
besides
now
i
am
agoin
to
kiss
you
and
then
you
got
ta
get
out
of
millings
do
you
hear
after
i
kissed
you
you
good
enough
for
my
purpose
not
for
mine
gathering
both
her
hands
in
one
of
his
he
put
the
hard
long
fingers
of
his
free
hand
back
of
her
head
holding
it
from
wincing
or
turning
and
his
mouth
dropped
upon
hers
and
seemed
to
smother
out
her
life
she
tasted
whiskey
and
the
blood
from
his
cut
lips
you
wo
tell
anyway
that
lie
again
he
panted
keeping
his
face
close
staring
into
her
wide
eyes
of
a
horrified
childishness
that
you
never
been
kissed
again
his
lips
fastened
on
her
mouth
he
let
her
go
strode
to
the
door
unlocked
it
and
went
out
she
had
fallen
to
the
floor
her
head
against
the
chair
she
beat
the
chair
with
her
hands
calling
softly
for
her
father
and
for
her
god
she
reproached
them
both
you
told
me
it
was
a
good
old
world
she
sobbed
you
told
me
it
was
a
good
old
world
chapter
xv
flames
a
hot
dry
day
followed
on
the
cool
dawn
in
his
room
dickie
lay
across
his
bed
the
sun
blazed
in
at
his
single
long
window
the
big
flies
that
had
risen
from
the
dirty
yard
buzzed
and
bumped
against
the
upper
pane
and
made
aimless
endless
mazy
circles
above
and
below
one
another
in
the
stifling
odorous
atmosphere
dickie
lay
there
like
an
image
of
icarus
an
eternal
symbol
of
defeated
youth
one
could
almost
see
about
his
slenderness
the
trailing
shattered
wings
he
had
wept
out
the
first
shock
of
his
anger
and
his
shame
now
he
lay
in
a
despairing
stupor
his
bruised
face
burned
and
ached
his
chest
felt
tight
with
the
aching
and
burning
of
his
heart
any
suspicion
of
his
father
interpretation
of
his
presence
in
sheila
room
was
mercifully
spared
him
but
the
knowledge
that
he
had
been
brutally
jerked
back
from
her
pure
and
patient
lips
had
been
ignominiously
punished
before
her
eyes
and
turned
out
like
a
whipped
boy
this
knowledge
was
a
dreadful
torture
to
his
pride
sheila
to
be
sure
did
not
love
him
even
a
little
bit
she
had
said
so
all
the
longing
and
the
tumult
of
his
heart
during
these
months
had
made
no
more
impression
upon
her
than
a
frantic
sea
makes
upon
the
little
bird
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
she
had
he
must
think
hardly
been
aware
of
it
and
it
was
such
a
terrible
and
frantic
actuality
he
had
fancied
that
it
must
have
beaten
forever
day
by
day
night
by
night
at
her
consciousness
can
a
woman
live
near
so
turbulent
a
thing
and
not
even
guess
at
its
existence
her
hand
against
his
heart
had
lain
so
limp
and
dead
he
had
hoped
of
course
that
she
loved
him
the
way
he
loved
probably
no
one
else
could
feel
what
he
felt
and
live
so
dickie
in
young
eternal
fashion
believed
in
his
own
miracle
but
she
might
have
loved
him
a
little
a
very
little
in
time
if
she
had
seen
him
beaten
and
shamed
and
cuffed
out
of
her
presence
like
a
dog
now
there
was
no
hope
no
hope
at
all
no
hope
dickie
rocked
his
head
against
his
arm
he
had
told
sheila
that
he
would
take
care
of
her
but
he
could
not
even
defend
himself
he
had
told
her
that
he
would
die
to
save
her
any
suffering
but
before
her
he
had
writhed
and
gasped
helplessly
under
the
weight
of
another
man
hand
his
open
hand
not
even
a
fist
no
after
act
of
his
could
efface
from
sheila
memory
that
picture
of
his
ignominy
she
had
seen
him
twisted
and
bent
and
beaten
and
thrown
away
his
father
had
triumphantly
returned
to
reassure
and
comfort
her
for
the
insult
of
a
boy
impertinence
would
sheila
defend
him
would
she
understand
or
would
she
not
be
justified
in
contemptuous
laughter
at
his
pretensions
such
thoughts
less
like
thoughts
however
than
like
fiery
fever
fits
twisted
and
scorched
dickie
mind
as
he
lay
there
they
burnt
into
him
wounds
that
for
years
throbbed
slowly
into
scars
at
noon
the
heat
of
his
room
became
even
more
intolerable
than
his
thoughts
his
head
beat
with
pain
he
was
bathed
in
sweat
weak
and
trembling
he
dragged
himself
up
went
to
his
washstand
and
dipped
his
wincing
face
into
the
warmish
stale
water
his
lips
felt
cracked
and
dry
and
swollen
in
the
wavy
mirror
he
saw
a
distorted
image
of
his
face
with
its
heavy
eyes
scattered
hair
and
the
darkening
marks
of
his
father
blows
punctuated
by
the
scarlet
scratches
of
the
emerald
he
dried
his
face
loosened
his
collar
and
gasping
for
air
came
out
into
the
narrow
hall
the
hotel
was
very
still
he
hurried
through
it
his
face
bent
and
went
by
the
back
way
to
the
saloon
at
this
hour
sheila
was
asleep
carthy
would
be
alone
in
the
aura
and
there
would
be
few
if
any
customers
dickie
found
the
place
cool
and
quiet
and
empty
shuttered
from
the
sun
the
air
stirred
by
electric
fans
carthy
dozed
in
his
chair
behind
the
bar
he
gave
dickie
his
order
somnambulantly
dickie
took
it
off
to
a
dim
corner
and
drank
with
the
thirst
of
a
wounded
beast
three
or
four
hours
later
he
staggered
back
to
his
room
a
thunderstorm
was
rumbling
and
flashing
down
from
the
mountains
to
the
north
the
window
was
and
a
storm
wind
blew
the
dirty
curtains
straight
and
steady
into
the
room
the
cool
wind
tasted
and
smelt
of
hot
dust
dickie
felt
his
dazed
way
to
the
bed
and
steadied
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
with
infinite
difficulty
he
rolled
and
lighted
a
cigarette
drew
at
it
took
it
out
tried
to
put
it
again
between
his
lips
and
fell
over
on
his
back
his
arm
trailing
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
the
lighted
cigarette
slipped
from
his
fingers
to
the
ragged
strip
of
matting
dickie
lay
there
breathing
heavily
and
regularly
in
a
drunken
and
exhausted
sleep
a
vivid
flickering
pain
in
his
arm
woke
him
he
thought
for
an
instant
that
he
must
have
died
and
dropped
straight
into
hell
the
wind
still
blew
in
upon
him
but
it
blew
fire
against
him
above
him
there
was
a
heavy
panoply
of
smoke
his
bedclothes
were
burning
his
sleeve
was
on
fire
the
boards
of
his
floor
cracked
and
snapped
in
regiments
of
flame
he
got
up
still
in
a
half
stupor
plunged
his
arm
into
the
water
pitcher
saw
with
a
startled
oath
that
the
woodwork
about
his
door
was
blazing
in
long
tongues
of
fire
which
leaped
up
into
the
rafters
of
the
roof
his
brain
began
to
telegraph
its
messages
the
hotel
was
on
fire
he
could
not
imagine
what
had
started
it
he
remembered
sheila
he
ran
along
the
passage
the
roar
of
that
fire
following
him
as
the
draft
from
his
window
through
his
opened
door
gave
a
sudden
impulse
to
the
flames
and
he
came
to
sheila
he
knocked
had
no
answer
and
burst
in
he
saw
instantly
that
she
had
gone
her
father
picture
had
been
taken
her
little
books
her
sketches
her
her
small
yellow
vase
things
were
scattered
about
as
he
stood
staring
a
billow
of
black
smoke
rolled
into
the
room
he
went
quickly
through
the
bedroom
and
the
bath
calling
sheila
in
a
low
uncertain
voice
returned
to
the
to
find
the
air
already
pungent
and
hot
there
was
a
paper
pinned
up
on
the
mantel
sheila
writing
marched
across
it
dickie
rubbed
the
smoke
from
his
eyes
and
read
i
am
going
away
from
millings
and
i
am
not
coming
back
amelia
may
have
the
things
i
have
left
i
do
want
them
this
statement
was
addressed
to
no
one
she
has
gone
to
new
york
thought
dickie
his
confused
mind
became
possessed
with
the
immediate
purpose
of
following
her
there
was
an
eastern
train
in
the
late
afternoon
only
he
must
have
money
and
it
was
most
of
it
in
his
room
he
dashed
back
the
passage
was
ablaze
his
room
roared
like
the
very
heart
of
a
furnace
it
was
no
use
to
think
of
getting
in
there
well
he
had
something
in
his
pocket
enough
to
start
him
he
plunged
choking
into
sheila
again
for
some
reason
this
flight
of
hers
had
brought
back
his
hope
there
was
to
be
a
beginning
a
fresh
start
a
chance
he
went
over
to
the
chair
where
sheila
had
sat
in
the
comfort
of
his
arms
and
he
touched
the
piece
of
tapestry
on
its
back
that
was
his
to
millings
then
he
fastened
his
collar
smoothed
his
hair
standing
close
before
sheila
mirror
peering
and
blinking
through
the
smoke
and
buttoned
his
coat
painstakingly
there
would
be
a
hat
downstairs
as
he
turned
to
go
he
saw
a
little
brown
leather
book
lying
on
the
floor
below
the
mantel
he
picked
it
up
here
was
something
he
could
take
to
sheila
with
an
impulse
of
tenderness
he
opened
it
his
eyes
were
caught
by
a
stanza
the
blessed
damozel
leaned
out
from
the
gold
bar
of
heaven
her
eyes
were
deeper
than
the
depth
of
waters
stilled
at
even
she
had
three
lilies
in
her
hand
and
the
stars
in
her
hair
were
seven
there
are
people
no
doubt
who
will
not
be
able
to
believe
this
truthful
bit
of
dickie
history
the
smoke
was
drifting
across
him
the
roar
of
the
nearing
fire
was
in
his
ears
he
was
at
a
great
crisis
in
his
affairs
his
heart
was
hot
with
wounded
love
and
his
brain
hot
with
whiskey
and
with
hope
nevertheless
he
did
now
under
the
spell
of
those
printed
words
which
did
not
even
remotely
resemble
any
words
that
he
had
ever
read
or
heard
before
forget
the
smoke
the
roar
the
love
the
hope
and
standing
below
sheila
mirror
he
did
read
the
blessed
damozel
from
end
to
end
and
the
love
of
those
lovers
divided
by
all
the
space
between
the
shaken
worlds
and
the
beauty
of
her
tears
made
a
great
and
mystic
silence
of
rapture
about
him
o
god
dickie
said
twice
as
he
read
he
brushed
away
the
smoke
to
see
the
last
lines
and
wept
i
heard
her
tears
the
ecstatic
pain
of
beauty
gripped
him
to
the
forgetfulness
of
all
other
pain
or
ecstasy
o
god
he
came
to
with
a
start
shut
the
book
stuck
it
into
his
pocket
and
crooking
his
arm
over
his
smarting
eyes
he
plunged
out
of
the
room
millings
had
become
aware
of
its
disaster
dickie
fleeing
by
the
back
way
leaping
dangers
and
beating
through
fire
knew
by
the
distant
commotion
that
the
fire
brigade
of
which
he
was
a
member
was
gathering
its
men
for
the
glory
of
their
name
he
saw
too
that
with
a
wind
like
this
to
aid
the
fire
there
was
a
chance
for
the
aura
and
a
queer
pang
of
sympathy
for
his
father
stabbed
him
it
will
kill
pap
thought
dickie
save
for
this
pang
he
ran
along
the
road
toward
the
station
with
a
light
adventurous
heart
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
started
the
fire
himself
the
stupor
of
his
sleep
had
smothered
out
all
memory
of
the
cigarette
he
had
lighted
and
let
fall
unwittingly
dickie
had
killed
the
beauty
of
his
father
dream
and
now
just
as
unwittingly
he
was
about
to
kill
the
object
of
his
father
passion
when
he
looked
back
from
the
station
platform
the
roof
of
the
aura
was
already
in
a
blaze
part
two
the
stars
chapter
i
the
hill
thatcher
spoke
to
his
horses
now
fatherly
now
masterly
now
with
a
professorial
sarcasm
come
on
monkey
there
a
good
girl
get
out
of
that
you
fox
dern
you
you
call
that
pulling
it
my
notion
of
off
for
the
day
even
at
its
most
urgent
his
voice
was
soft
hushed
by
the
great
loneliness
of
this
cañon
up
which
he
slowly
crept
monkey
and
fox
had
been
plodding
foot
by
foot
the
creaking
wagon
at
their
heels
since
dawn
it
was
now
ten
and
they
were
just
beginning
to
climb
the
hill
that
looked
so
near
to
the
mesa
above
hudson
yard
still
stood
aloof
it
had
towered
there
ahead
of
them
as
they
jerked
and
toiled
across
the
interminable
flat
in
their
accompanying
cloud
of
dust
the
great
circle
of
the
world
had
dwarfed
them
to
a
bitter
insignificance
a
team
of
crickets
they
seemed
driven
by
a
gnome
the
hushed
tone
of
thatcher
voice
made
unconscious
tribute
to
this
immensity
as
they
came
to
the
opening
of
the
cañon
the
high
disappeared
the
immediate
foothills
closed
down
and
shut
it
out
the
air
grew
headily
light
even
under
the
blazing
july
sun
it
came
cool
to
the
lungs
cool
and
intensely
sweet
thousands
of
wild
flowers
perfumed
it
and
the
resin
of
a
thousand
firs
all
the
while
the
rushing
of
water
accompanied
the
creaking
of
thatcher
progress
not
far
from
the
road
down
there
below
in
a
tangle
of
pine
branches
willows
and
ferns
the
stream
fled
toward
the
valley
with
all
the
seeming
terror
of
escape
here
the
team
began
their
tugging
and
their
panting
and
their
long
pauses
to
get
breath
thatcher
would
push
forward
the
wooden
handle
that
moved
his
brake
and
at
the
sound
and
the
grating
of
the
wheel
the
horses
would
stop
automatically
and
stand
with
heaving
sides
the
wagon
shook
slightly
with
their
breathing
at
such
times
the
stream
seemed
to
shout
in
the
stillness
below
there
began
to
be
an
extraordinary
view
of
the
golden
country
with
its
orange
mesas
and
its
dark
purple
rim
of
mountains
millings
was
a
tiny
circle
of
square
pebbles
something
built
up
by
children
in
their
play
the
awful
impersonalities
of
sky
and
earth
swept
away
its
small
human
importance
thatcher
eyes
absorbed
serenity
they
had
drawn
their
color
and
their
clearness
from
such
long
contemplations
of
distant
horizon
lines
now
and
again
however
thatcher
would
glance
back
and
down
from
his
high
seat
at
his
load
it
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
boxes
of
canned
goods
but
near
the
front
there
was
a
sort
of
nest
made
from
bags
of
indian
meal
in
the
middle
of
the
nest
lay
another
bundle
of
slim
irregular
outline
it
was
covered
with
a
thin
blanket
and
a
piece
of
sacking
protected
it
from
the
sun
a
large
clumsy
parcel
lay
beside
it
each
time
thatcher
looked
at
this
portion
of
his
load
he
pulled
more
anxiously
at
his
mustache
at
last
when
the
noon
sun
stood
straight
above
the
pass
and
he
stopped
to
water
his
horses
at
a
trough
which
caught
a
trickle
of
spring
water
he
bent
down
and
softly
raised
the
piece
of
sacking
suspended
like
a
tent
from
one
fat
sack
to
another
above
the
object
of
his
uneasiness
there
in
the
complete
relaxation
of
exhausted
sleep
lay
sheila
no
child
more
limp
and
innocent
of
aspect
her
hair
damp
and
ringed
on
her
smooth
forehead
her
lips
mournful
and
sweet
sedately
closed
her
expression
at
once
proud
and
innocent
and
wistful
as
is
the
sleeping
face
of
a
little
little
girl
there
was
that
look
of
a
broken
flower
that
look
of
lovely
death
that
stops
the
heart
of
a
mother
sometimes
when
she
bends
over
a
crib
and
sees
damp
curls
in
a
halo
about
a
strange
familiar
face
thatcher
looking
at
sheila
had
some
of
these
thoughts
a
teamster
is
either
philosopher
or
clown
one
can
not
move
day
after
day
all
day
for
a
thousand
days
under
a
changeless
changeful
sky
inch
by
inch
across
the
surface
of
a
changeless
changeful
earth
and
not
come
very
near
to
some
of
the
locked
doors
of
the
temple
where
clowns
sleep
and
wise
men
meditate
and
thatcher
was
a
father
one
of
the
wise
and
reasonable
fathers
of
the
west
whose
sons
are
friends
and
helpmates
and
toward
whom
daughters
are
moved
to
little
acts
of
motherliness
the
sun
blazed
for
a
minute
on
sheila
face
she
opened
her
eyes
looked
vaguely
from
some
immense
distance
at
thatcher
and
then
sat
up
oh
gracious
said
sheila
woman
and
sprite
and
adventurer
again
where
the
dickens
is
my
hat
did
it
fall
out
no
thatcher
smiled
in
a
relieved
fashion
i
put
it
under
the
seat
sheila
scrambled
to
a
perch
on
one
of
the
sacks
and
faced
the
surface
of
half
a
world
oh
thatcher
is
it
too
wonderful
how
high
are
we
is
this
the
other
side
oh
no
i
can
see
millings
poor
tiny
tiny
millings
it
small
is
it
how
very
small
it
is
what
air
she
shut
her
eyes
drawing
in
the
perfumed
tonic
the
altitude
had
intoxicated
her
her
heart
was
beating
fast
her
blood
tingling
her
brain
electrified
every
sense
seemed
to
be
sharpened
she
saw
and
smelt
and
heard
with
abnormal
vividness
the
flowers
are
awfully
bright
up
here
are
they
she
said
that
bushy
one
indian
and
that
blue
one
it
blue
i
do
believe
i
ever
knew
what
blueness
meant
before
lupine
and
over
yonder
monkshead
that
other
larkspur
that
poisons
cattle
in
the
spring
on
the
other
side
you
see
a
whole
lot
more
wild
hollyhock
and
fireweed
and
columbine
well
say
i
learned
all
them
names
from
a
dude
i
drove
over
one
summer
and
such
a
sky
said
sheila
lifting
her
head
and
such
big
pines
she
lost
herself
for
a
minute
in
the
azure
immensity
above
a
vast
mosque
of
cloud
dome
bubbles
great
and
small
stood
ahead
of
them
dwarfing
every
human
experience
of
height
thatcher
there
is
any
air
up
here
what
is
it
we
trying
to
breathe
anyway
he
smiled
patiently
sympathetically
and
handed
her
a
tin
mug
of
icy
water
from
the
little
trickling
spring
the
bruise
of
hudson
kiss
ached
at
the
cold
touch
of
the
water
and
a
shadow
fell
over
her
excitement
she
thanked
the
driver
gravely
what
time
is
it
now
she
asked
past
noon
better
eat
your
sandwich
she
took
one
from
its
wrapping
pensively
but
ate
it
with
eagerness
thatcher
blue
eyes
twinkled
seems
like
i
recollect
a
lady
that
did
want
no
food
to
be
put
in
for
her
i
remember
her
too
said
sheila
between
bites
but
very
very
vaguely
she
stood
up
after
a
third
sandwich
shook
crumbs
from
her
skirt
and
stretched
her
arms
what
a
great
sleep
i
had
since
six
she
stared
down
at
the
lower
world
i
left
somebody
at
millings
who
that
asked
thatcher
drawling
the
words
a
trifle
as
a
westerner
does
when
he
is
conscious
of
a
double
meaning
me
thatcher
laughed
you
a
real
funny
girl
miss
arundel
he
said
yes
i
left
one
me
when
i
decided
to
go
into
the
saloon
and
now
left
another
me
i
believe
people
shed
their
skins
like
snakes
yes
i
had
that
notion
myself
but
as
you
get
older
your
skin
kind
of
peels
off
easy
and
gradual
you
do
get
them
shocks
when
you
sort
of
come
out
all
new
and
shiny
and
admirin
of
yourself
sheila
blushed
faintly
and
looked
at
him
his
face
was
serene
and
empty
of
intention
but
she
felt
that
she
had
been
guilty
of
egotism
as
indeed
she
had
she
asked
rather
meekly
for
her
hat
and
having
put
it
on
like
a
shadow
above
her
fairness
she
climbed
up
to
thatcher
side
on
the
driver
seat
the
hat
was
her
felt
stetson
and
for
the
rest
she
was
clad
in
her
the
boy
shirt
the
short
corduroy
skirt
the
boots
her
youthfulness
rather
than
her
strange
beauty
was
accentuated
by
this
dress
she
had
the
look
of
a
boy
a
sort
of
fairy
prince
are
we
on
the
road
asked
sheila
presently
thatcher
gave
way
to
mirth
do
it
seem
like
a
road
to
you
she
lurched
against
him
then
saved
herself
from
falling
out
at
the
other
side
by
a
frantic
clutch
is
it
a
road
she
looked
down
a
dizzy
slope
of
which
the
foothold
seemed
to
her
the
most
precarious
part
yes
all
the
road
there
is
we
call
it
that
we
kind
of
to
these
little
efforts
of
the
government
kind
of
want
to
encourage
congressmen
kind
of
needs
coaxin
and
they
right
ornery
critters
i
heard
an
argyment
atween
a
feller
with
a
hoss
and
a
feller
with
a
mule
onct
the
mule
feller
was
kind
of
uppish
about
hosses
said
he
did
see
the
advantage
of
the
critter
a
mule
now
was
steady
and
easy
fed
and
strong
well
the
hoss
feller
got
kind
of
hot
after
some
of
this
so
he
says
sir
he
says
this
about
it
when
you
got
a
hoss
you
got
a
hoss
you
know
what
you
got
he
goin
to
act
like
a
hoss
but
when
you
got
a
mule
why
you
ca
never
tell
all
of
a
sudden
one
of
these
days
he
like
as
not
to
turn
into
a
congressman
well
that
the
way
we
feel
about
ho
there
monkey
keep
up
i
just
get
out
an
hang
on
the
wheel
while
we
make
this
corner
that
keep
us
from
turnin
over
i
reckon
sheila
sat
and
held
on
with
both
hands
her
eyes
were
wide
and
very
bright
she
held
her
breath
till
thatcher
got
in
again
the
corner
safely
made
for
the
next
creeping
lurching
mile
sheila
found
that
every
muscle
in
her
body
had
its
use
in
keeping
her
on
that
seat
then
they
reached
the
snow
and
matters
grew
definitely
worse
here
half
the
road
was
four
feet
of
dirty
icy
drift
and
half
of
abysmal
mud
they
slipped
from
drift
to
mire
with
awful
perils
and
rackings
of
the
wagon
and
painful
struggles
of
the
team
sometimes
the
snow
softened
and
let
the
horses
in
up
to
their
necks
when
thatcher
plied
whip
and
tongue
with
necessary
cruelty
at
last
there
came
disaster
they
were
making
one
of
those
turns
sheila
had
got
out
and
was
adding
her
mosquito
weight
to
thatcher
on
the
upper
side
to
the
wagon
the
outer
wheels
were
deep
in
mud
the
inner
wheels
hung
clear
the
horses
strained
and
slipped
let
go
shouted
thatcher
sheila
fell
back
into
the
snow
and
the
wagon
turned
quietly
over
and
began
to
slide
down
the
slope
thatcher
sprang
to
his
horses
heads
for
an
instant
it
seemed
that
they
would
be
dragged
over
the
edge
then
the
wagon
stopped
and
thatcher
grim
and
pale
unhitched
his
team
he
swore
fluently
under
his
breath
during
this
entire
operation
afterwards
he
turned
to
the
scarlet
and
astounded
passenger
and
gave
her
one
of
his
shining
smiles
well
he
said
beginning
to
roll
a
cigarette
what
do
you
think
of
that
whatever
shall
we
do
now
asked
sheila
she
had
identified
herself
utterly
with
this
team
this
load
this
driver
she
brushed
the
snow
from
her
skirt
climbed
down
from
the
drift
to
the
edge
of
the
mire
by
thatcher
elbow
the
team
stood
with
hanging
heads
panting
and
steaming
glad
of
the
rest
and
the
release
well
said
thatcher
looking
down
at
the
loyal
anxious
face
with
a
certain
tenderness
i
agoin
to
do
one
of
two
things
agoin
to
lead
my
team
over
the
hill
and
come
back
with

and

to

agoin

and
wait

dark
hullo
he
interrupted
himself
lifting
his
chin
i
hear
hosses
now
they
both
listened
no
wagon
said
thatcher
five
minutes
later
a
slouching
horseman
cigarette
in
mouth
shaggy
chaps
on
long
legs
spurred
and
booted
and
decorated
with
a
red
came
picturesquely
into
view
his
pony
dug
sturdy
feet
into
the
steep
roadside
avoiding
the
mud
of
the
road
itself
the
man
led
two
other
horses
saddled
but
empty
of
riders
he
stopped
and
between
him
and
thatcher
took
place
one
of
the
immensely
tranquil
meditative
and
deliberate
conversations
of
the
far
west
sheila
quick
celtic
nerves
tormented
her
at
last
she
broke
in
with
an
inspiration

i
hire
one
of
your
horses
she
asked
rising
from
an
overturned
sack
of
which
she
had
made

down
at
her
with
grave
considerate
eyes

said

added

there
he
evidently
wanted
to
ask
her
her
destination
but
his
courtesy
forbade
sheila
volunteered
i
am
going
to
miss
blake
ranch
up
hidden
creek
a
sort
of
flash
of
surprise
passed
across
the
reserved
brown
young
face
yes
he
said
with
no
expression
well
you
better
leave
the
rest
of
your
trip
until
he
slipped
from
his
horse
with
an
effortless
ripple
untied
a
tawny
little
pony
with
a
thick
neck
a
round
body
and
a
mild
intelligent
face
and
led
him
to
sheila
who
mounted
from
her
sack
thatcher
carefully
adjusted
the
stirrups
a
primitive
process
that
involved
the
wearisome
lacing
and
unlacing
of
leather
thongs
sheila
bade
him
a
bright
and
adventurous
thanked
the
unknown
owner
of
the
horse
and
started
the
pony
showed
some
unwillingness
to
leave
his
companions
fretted
and
tossed
his
head
and
made
a
few
attempts
at
a
face
but
sheila
dug
in
her
small
spurred
heels
and
spoke
beguilingly
at
last
he
settled
down
to
sober
climbing
sheila
looked
back
and
waved
her
hand
the
two
tall
lean
men
were
gazing
after
her
they
took
off
their
hats
and
waved
she
felt
a
warmth
that
was
almost
loving
for
their
gracefulness
and
gravity
and
kindness
here
was
another
breed
of
man
than
that
produced
by
millings
a
few
minutes
later
she
came
to
the
top
of
the
pass
and
looked
down
into
hidden
creek
chapter
ii
adventure
sheila
stood
and
drew
breath
the
shadow
of
the
high
peak
in
the
lap
of
which
she
stood
poured
itself
eastward
across
the
warm
lush
narrow
land
this
was
different
from
the
hard
dull
gold
and
alkali
dust
of
the
millings
country
here
were
miles
of
range
and
miles
of
pine
forest
and
lovely
lighter
fringes
and
groves
of
cottonwood
and
aspen
trees
here
and
there
were
little
dots
of
ranches
visible
more
by
their
vivid
oat
and
alfalfa
fields
than
by
their
small
log
cabins
down
the
valley
the
river
flickered
lifted
by
its
brightness
above
the
hollow
that
held
it
till
it
seemed
just
hung
there
like
a
string
of
jewels
beyond
it
the
land
rose
slowly
in
noble
sweeps
to
the
opposite
ranges
two
chains
that
sloped
across
each
other
in
a
glorious
confusion
of
heads
round
and
soft
as
velvet
against
the
blue
sky
or
blunt
and
broken
with
a
thundery
look
of
extinct
craters
to
the
north
sheila
saw
a
further
serenity
of
mountains
lying
low
and
soft
on
the
horizon
of
another
and
more
wistful
blue
over
it
all
was
a
sort
of
magical
haze
soft
and
brilliant
as
though
the
air
were
a
melted
sapphire
there
was
still
blessedness
such
as
sheila
had
never
felt
she
was
filled
with
a
longing
to
ride
on
and
on
until
her
spirit
should
pass
into
the
wide
tranquil
glowing
spirit
of
the
lonely
land
it
seemed
to
her
that
some
forgotten
medicine
man
sat
in
a
hollow
of
the
hills
blowing
from
a
great
peace
pipe
the
blue
smoke
of
peace
down
and
along
the
hollows
and
the
cañons
and
the
level
lengths
of
range
in
the
mighty
breast
of
the
blower
there
was
not
even
a
memory
of
trouble
only
a
noble
savage
serenity
too
deep
for
prayer
she
rode
for
a
long
while
no
sound
but
her
pony
hoofs
her
eyes
lifted
across
the
valley
until
a
sudden
fragrance
drew
her
attention
earthwards
she
was
going
through
an
open
glade
of
aspens
and
the
ground
was
white
with
columbine
enormous
flowers
snowy
and
crisp
as
though
freshly
starched
by
fairy
laundresses
with
a
cry
of
delight
sheila
jumped
off
her
horse
tied
him
by
his
reins
to
a
tree
and
began
gathering
flowers
with
all
the
eager
concentration
of
a
and
like
all
the
of
fable
from
proserpina
down
she
found
herself
the
victim
of
disaster
when
she
came
back
to
the
road
with
a
useless
already
perishing
mass
of
white
the
pony
had
disappeared
her
knot
had
been
unfaithful
quietly
that
animal
had
pulled
himself
free
and
tiptoed
back
to
join
his
friends
sheila
hurried
up
the
road
toward
the
summit
she
had
so
recently
crossed
till
the
altitude
forced
her
to
stop
with
no
breath
in
her
body
and
a
pounding
redness
before
her
eyes
she
stamped
her
feet
with
vexation
she
longed
to
cry
she
remembered
confusedly
but
with
a
certain
satisfaction
some
of
the
things
thatcher
had
said
to
his
team
an
entire
and
sudden
lenience
toward
the
gentle
art
of
swearing
was
born
in
her
she
threw
her
columbine
angrily
away
she
had
come
so
far
on
her
journey
that
she
could
never
be
able
to
get
back
to
thatcher
nor
even
to
shanty
before
dark
and
how
far
down
still
the
valley
lay
with
that
shadow
widening
and
lengthening
across
it
her
sudden
loneliness
descended
upon
her
with
an
almost
audible
rush
dusk
at
this
height
dusk
with
a
keen
smell
of
glaciers
and
pines
dusk
with
the
world
nine
thousand
feet
below
and
about
her
this
of
where
the
trees
seemed
to
slant
and
the
very
flowers
to
be
outrun
by
a
mysterious
sort
of
flight
of
rebel
earth
toward
space
the
great
and
heady
height
was
informed
with
a
presence
which
if
not
hostile
was
terrifyingly
ignorant
of
man
there
was
some
one
not
far
away
she
felt
just
above
there
behind
the
rocky
ridge
just
back
there
in
the
confusion
of
purplish
darkness
streaked
by
columns
just
below
in
the
thicket
of
the
stream
some
one
to
meet
whose
look
meant
death
her
first
instinct
was
to
keep
to
the
road
she
walked
on
down
toward
the
valley
very
rapidly
but
going
down
meant
meeting
darkness
she
began
to
be
unreasonably
afraid
of
the
night
she
was
afflicted
by
an
old
old
childish
immemorial
dread
of
bears
in
spite
of
the
chill
she
was
very
warm
her
tongue
dry
with
rapid
breathing
of
the
thin
air
she
was
intolerably
thirsty
the
sound
of
water
called
to
her
in
a
lisping
inhuman
voice
she
resisted
till
she
was
ashamed
of
her
cowardice
stepped
furtively
off
the
track
scrambled
down
a
slope
parted
some
branches
and
found
herself
on
a
rock
above
a
little
swirling
pool
on
the
other
side
a
man
kneeling
over
the
water
lifted
a
white
and
startled
face
through
the
eerie
green
twilight
up
into
which
the
pool
threw
a
shifty
leaden
brightness
the
two
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
the
man
rose
to
his
feet
and
smiled
sheila
noticed
that
he
had
been
bathing
a
bloody
wrist
round
which
he
was
now
wrapping
clumsily
a
handkerchief
do
be
frightened
he
said
in
a
rather
uncertain
voice
i
not
near
so
desperate
as
i
look
do
you
want
a
drink
hand
me
down
your
cup
if
you
have
one
and
i
fill
it
for
you
i
not
afraid
now
sheila
quavered
and
drew
a
big
breath
but
i
was
startled
for
a
minute
i
have
any
cup
i
i
suppose
in
a
way
i
lost
he
was
peering
at
her
now
and
when
she
took
off
her
hat
and
rubbed
her
damp
forehead
with
a
weary
worried
gesture
he
gave
a
little
exclamation
and
swung
himself
across
the
stream
by
a
branch
and
up
to
her
side
on
the
rock
the
barmaid
he
said
and
i
was
coming
to
see
you
sheila
laughed
in
the
relieved
surprise
of
recognition
why
you
are
the
cowboy
the
one
that
fought
so
so
terribly
have
you
been
fighting
again
your
wrist
is
hurt
may
i
tie
it
up
for
you
he
held
out
his
arm
silently
and
she
tied
the
handkerchief
a
large
clean
coarse
one
neatly
about
it
what
with
weariness
and
the
shock
of
her
fright
her
fingers
were
not
very
steady
he
looked
down
at
her
during
the
operation
with
a
contented
expression
it
seemed
that
the
moment
was
filled
for
him
with
satisfaction
to
a
complete
forgetfulness
of
past
or
present
annoyances
this
is
a
big
piece
of
luck
for
me
he
said
but
with
a
sudden
thundery
change
of
countenance
you
not
going
over
to
hidden
creek
are
you
i
trying
to
go
there
said
sheila
i
been
trying
ever
since
five
this
morning
but
i
do
seem
to
be
getting
there
very
fast
i
wanted
to
make
rusty
before
dark
and
my
pony
got
away
from
me
and
went
back
i
know
he
went
back
because
i
saw
the
marks
of
his
feet
and
he
would
have
gone
back
would
he
do
you
think
i
could
get
to
rusty
on
foot
no
i
know
you
could
you
could
make
it
easy
on
horseback
though
he
stared
meditatively
above
her
head
and
then
said
in
a
tone
of
resignation
i
believe
i
better
go
back
myself
i
take
you
she
had
finished
her
bandage
she
looked
up
at
him
go
back
but
you
must
have
just
started
from
there
a
few
hours
ago
well
i
did
come
very
direct
i
kind
of
shifted
round
but
i
can
go
back
straight
and
i
really
rather
i
think
i
better
it
was
all
foolishness
my
coming
over
i
can
put
you
up
back
of
me
on
my
horse
if
you
do
mind
and
we
get
to
rusty
before
it
lit
up
i
rather
you
do
mind
riding
that
way
do
you
you
see
if
i
put
you
up
and
walked
it
take
lots
more
time
i
do
mind
said
sheila
but
she
said
it
rather
proudly
so
that
hilliard
smiled
well
we
can
try
it
anyway
if
you
go
back
to
the
road
i
get
my
horse
he
seemed
to
have
hidden
his
horse
in
a
density
of
trees
a
mile
from
the
road
sheila
waited
till
she
thought
she
must
have
dreamed
her
meeting
with
him
he
came
back
looking
a
trifle
sheepish
you
see
he
said
i
did
come
by
the
road
the
horse
was
a
large
bony
animal
with
a
mean
eye
that
is
the
pony
you
rode
when
you
came
to
millings
said
sheila
he
bent
to
examine
his
no
he
said
gently
been
riding
quite
a
variety
of
lately
i
get
on
first
if
you
do
mind
and
give
you
a
hand
up
you
put
your
foot
on
mine
the
horse
will
stand
sheila
obeyed
pressing
her
lips
tight
for
she
was
afraid
however
his
long
supple
fingers
closed
over
her
wrist
like
steel
and
she
got
quickly
and
easily
to
her
perch
and
clung
nervously
to
him
that
right
put
your
arms
round
tight
are
you
all
fixed
y
yes
and
comfortable
y
yes
i
think
so
we
off
then
they
started
on
a
quick
steady
walk
down
the
road
once
cosme
loosened
the
on
his
hip
he
whistled
incessantly
through
his
teeth
except
for
this
they
were
both
silent
were
you
coming
to
millings
asked
sheila
at
last
she
was
of
the
world
where
silence
has
a
certain
oppressive
significance
she
was
getting
used
to
her
peculiar
physical
position
and
found
she
did
not
have
to
cling
so
desperately
but
in
a
social
sense
she
was
embarrassed
he
was
quite
impersonal
about
the
situation
which
made
matters
easier
for
her
now
and
then
she
suppressed
a
frantic
impulse
to
giggle
yes
to
see
you
he
answered
i
never
rightly
thanked
you
she
saw
the
back
of
his
neck
flush
and
she
blushed
too
remembering
his
quickly
diverted
kiss
which
had
left
a
smear
of
blood
across
her
fingers
that
had
happened
only
a
few
days
before
but
they
were
long
days
he
too
must
have
been
well
occupied
there
was
still
a
bruise
on
his
temple
i
i
was
quite
right
in
the
head
after
those
fellows
had
beat
me
up
and
i
kind
of
wanted
to
show
you
that
i
am
something
like
a
gentleman
have
you
been
in
hidden
creek
yes
i
was
thinking
of
prospecting
around
i
meant
to
homestead
over
there
i
like
the
country
but
when
it
comes
to
settling
down
i
get
kind
of
restless
and
usually
i
get
into
a
that
changes
my
intentions
so
i
about
decided
to
go
back
down
arizona
way
and
where
are
you
going
to
stay
in
hidden
creek
he
asked
your
stuff
thatcher
has
it
in
his
wagon
i
going
to
miss
blake
ranch
she
invited
me
miss
blake
you
mean
the
lady
that
wears
pants
you
do
mean
it
well
that
right
amusing
he
laughed
sheila
stirred
angrily
i
ca
see
why
it
amusing
he
sobered
at
once
well
maybe
it
is
no
i
reckon
it
is
how
long
will
you
stay
sheila
gave
a
big
sobbing
sigh
i
do
know
if
she
likes
me
and
if
i
happy
i
stay
there
always
she
added
with
a
queer
dazed
realization
of
the
truth
i
nowhere
else
to
go
have
you
any
folks
he
asked
no
got
tired
of
millings
yes
very
i
do
blame
you
it
not
much
of
a
town
you
like
hidden
creek
and
miss
blake
ranch
is
a
mighty
pretty
place
lonesome
but
wonderfully
pretty
right
on
a
bend
of
the
creek
up
the
valley
close
under
the
mountains
but
can
you
stand
loneliness
miss
what
your
name
there
were
curious
breaks
in
his
manner
of
a
western
cowboy
breaks
that
startled
sheila
like
little
echoes
from
her
life
abroad
and
in
the
east
there
was
a
quickness
of
voice
and
manner
an
impatience
a
hot
and
nervous
something
and
his
voice
and
accent
suggested
training
the
abrupt
question
for
instance
was
not
in
the
least
characteristic
of
a
westerner
my
name
is
sheila
arundel
i
do
know
yours
either
do
you
come
from
the
east
yes
from
new
york
he
gave
an
infinitesimal
jerk
but
i
lived
abroad
nearly
all
my
life
i
think
it
would
be
politer
if
you
would
answer
my
question
now
she
felt
that
he
controlled
an
anxious
breath
my
name
is
hilliard
he
said
and
he
pronounced
the
name
with
a
queer
bitter
accent
as
though
the
taste
of
it
was
unpleasant
to
his
tongue
cosme
hilliard
do
you
think
it
a
name
for
half
a
second
she
was
silent
then
she
spoke
with
careful
unconsciousness
yes
very
nice
and
very
unusual
hilliard
is
an
english
name
is
it
where
did
the
cosme
come
from
it
was
well
done
so
well
that
she
felt
a
certain
tightening
of
his
body
relax
and
his
voice
sounded
fuller
that
spanish
i
some
spanish
blood
here
buffin
ranch
we
getting
down
sheila
was
remembering
vividly
sylvester
had
come
into
her
compartment
she
could
see
the
rolling
nebraskan
country
slipping
by
the
window
of
the
train
she
could
see
his
sallow
fingers
folding
the
paper
so
that
she
could
conveniently
read
a
paragraph
she
remembered
his
gentle
pensive
speech
ai
it
funny
though
those
things
happen
in
the
slums
and
they
happen
in
the
smart
set
but
they
do
happen
near
so
often
to
just
middling
folks
like
you
and
me
do
it
sound
like
a
tenderloin
tale
though
south
american
wife
and
american
husband
and
her
getting
jealous
and
up
and
shooting
him
money
sure
makes
love
popular
now
if
it
had
been
poor
folks
why
they
have
hardly
missed
a
day
work
but
just
because
these
hilliards
have
got
spondulix
they
run
a
paragraph
about
in
the
papers
for
a
month
sheila
began
to
make
comparisons
a
south
american
wife
and
an
american
husband
and
here
this
young
man
with
the
name
and
the
physique
and
a
voice
that
showed
training
and
faltered
over
the
pronouncing
of
the
hilliard
as
though
he
expected
it
to
be
too
well
remembered
had
there
been
some
mention
in
the
paper
of
a
son
a
son
in
the
west
a
son
under
a
cloud
of
some
sort
but
she
checked
her
spinning
of
romance
this
youth
was
too
genuine
a
cowboy
the
way
he
rode
the
way
he
moved
held
himself
his
phrases
his
turn
of
speech
with
all
that
wealth
behind
him
how
had
he
been
allowed
to
grow
up
like
this
no
her
notion
was
unreasonable
almost
impossible
although
dismissed
it
hung
about
her
mental
presentment
of
him
however
like
a
rather
baleful
aura
not
without
fascination
to
a
imagination
so
busy
was
she
with
her
fabrications
that
several
miles
of
road
slipped
by
unnoticed
there
came
a
strange
confusion
in
her
thoughts
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
arguing
the
hilliard
case
with
some
one
then
with
a
horrible
start
she
saw
that
the
face
of
her
opponent
was
sylvester
and
she
pushed
it
violently
away
do
you
go
to
sleep
said
hilliard
softly
laughing
a
little
you
might
fall
off
i
i
was
asleep
sheila
confessed
in
confusion
at
discovering
that
her
head
had
dropped
against
him
how
dark
it
getting
we
in
the
valley
are
we
yes
we
most
there
he
hesitated
miss
arundel
i
think
best
let
you
get
down
just
before
we
get
to
rusty
get
down
why
he
cleared
his
throat
to
her
in
the
dusky
twilight
that
was
now
very
nearly
darkness
his
face
was
troubled
and
ashamed
like
the
face
of
a
boy
who
tries
to
make
little
of
a
scrape
well
yesterday
the
folks
in
rusty
kind
of
lost
their
heads
they
had
a
bad
case
of
sherlock
holmes
i
bought
a
horse
up
the
valley
from
a
chap
who
was
anxious
to
sell
him
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
playing
the
title
part
in
a
it
seems
that
i
was
riding
one
of
a
string
this
chap
had
rustled
from
several
of
the
natives
they
knew
the
horse
and
that
was
enough
for
their
nervous
system
they
had
never
set
eyes
on
me
before
and
they
would
take
my
word
for
my
blameless
past
they
told
me
to
keep
my
story
for
trial
when
they
took
me
over
to
the
court
meanwhile
they
gave
me
a
free
lodging
in
their
pen
miss
arundel
hilliard
dropped
his
ironic
tone
and
spoke
in
a
low
tense
voice
of
horror
his
face
stiffened
and
paled
that
was
awful
to
be
locked
in
not
to
be
able
to
get
fresh
breath
in
your
lungs
not
to
be
able
to
go
where
you
please
when
you
please
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
like
i
ca
stand
it
i
ca
stand
a
minute
of
it
i
was
in
that
pen
six
hours
i
felt
i
go
loco
if
i
was
there
all
night
i
guess
i
am
a
kind
of
fool
i
broke
jail
early
in
the
morning
and
caught
up
the
horse
they
got
a
shot
or
two
at
me
hit
my
wrist
but
i
made
my
getaway
this
horse
is
not
much
on
looks
but
he
sure
can
get
over
the
sagebrush
i
was
coming
over
to
see
you
there
was
that
in
his
voice
when
he
said
this
that
touched
heart
profoundly
this
restless
violent
young
adventurer
homeless
without
discipline
or
duty
had
turned
to
her
in
his
trouble
as
instinctively
as
though
she
had
been
his
mother
this
because
she
had
once
served
him
something
stirred
in
sheila
heart
and
then
hilliard
went
on
i
was
going
to
get
down
to
arizona
but
when
i
heard
you
were
coming
over
into
hidden
creek
it
seemed
like
foolishness
to
cut
myself
off
from
the
country
by
running
away
from
nothing
of
course
there
are
ways
to
prove
my
identity
with
those
fellows
it
only
means
putting
up
with
a
few
days
of
pen
he
gave
a
sigh
but
you
can
understand
that
this
is
just
the
horse
that
will
give
you
quietest
entrance
into
rusty
and
that
i
not
just
one
of
the
first
citizens
but
said
sheila
if
they
see
you
riding
in
with
me
they
certainly
wo
shoot
he
laughed
admiringly
you
game
he
said
but
miss
arundel
they
not
likely
to
do
any
more
shooting
it
not
a
man
riding
into
rusty
that
they
after
it
a
man
riding
out
of
rusty
they
know
i
coming
to
give
myself
up
i
just
stay
here
said
sheila
firmly
i
ca
let
you
i
too
tired
to
walk
i
too
sleepy
it
be
all
right
then
i
walk
he
pulled
in
his
horse
but
at
the
instant
stiffened
in
his
saddle
and
wheeled
about
on
the
road
a
rattle
of
galloping
hoofs
struck
the
ground
behind
them
two
riders
wheeled
and
stopped
one
drew
close
and
held
out
his
hand
say
stranger
shake
he
said
we
been
kickin
up
the
dust
to
beg
your
pardon
we
got
the
real
rustler
this
mornin
shortly
after
you
left
i
plumb
disgusted
and
disheartened
with
young
tommins
for
losin
his
head
an
shootin
off
his
gun
he
a
dern
fool
that
kid
a
regular
tenderfoot
nothin
wo
ever

short
of
growin
up

from
chicago
anyway
one
of
them
eastern
towns
i
see
he
got
you
too
winged
me
smiled
hilliard
well
i
right
pleased
i
wo
have
to
spend
another
night
in
your
pen
you
entered
for
drinks
the
sheriff
stands
here
he
bowed
to
sheila
removing
his
hat
this
lady
hilliard
performed
the
introduction
lost
her
horse
on
the
hill
she
aiming
to
stop
at
rusty
for
the
man
who
had
spoken
turned
to
his
silent
companion
ride
ahead
shorty
why
do
you
he
said
indignantly
and
tell
lander
there
a
lady
that
want
to
sleep
in
number
five
the
other
horseman
after
a
swift
searching
look
at
sheila
said
sure
in
a
very
mild
almost
cooing
voice
and
was
off
it
looked
to
sheila
like
a
runaway
but
the
men
showed
no
concern
they
jogged
companionably
on
their
way
fifteen
minutes
later
they
crossed
a
bridge
and
pulled
up
before
a
picket
fence
and
a
gate
they
were
in

chapter
iii
journey
end
the
social
life
of
rusty
already
complicated
by
the
necessity
it
was
under
to
atone
for
a
mistake
was
almost
unbearably
discomposed
by
the
arrival
of
a
strange
lady
this
was
no
light
matter
be
it
understood
hidden
creek
was
not
a
resort
for
ladies
and
so
signal
an
event
as
the
appearance
of
a
lady
a
young
lady
a
pretty
young
lady
demanded
considerable
effort
but
rusty
had
five
minutes
for
preparation
by
the
time
hilliard
rode
up
to
lander
gate
a
representative
group
of
citizens
had
gathered
there
one
contingent
took
charge
of
hilliard
married
men
a
little
unwilling
and
a
few
even
more
reluctant
elders
and
led
him
to
the
bowl
of
reparation
which
was
to
wash
away
all
memory
of
his
wrongs
the
others
far
the
larger
group
escorted
sheila
up
the
twelve
feet
of
board
walk
to
the
porch
of
hospitality
filled
by
the
massive
person
of
lander
on
that
brief
walk
sheila
was
fathered
brothered
grandfathered
husbanded
and
befriended
and
on
the
porch
all
in
the
person
of
lander
she
was
mothered
sistered
and
grandmothered
up
the
stairs
to
number
five
she
was
eased
there
is
no
other
word
to
express
the
process
and
down
again
she
was
eased
to
supper
where
in
a
daze
of
fatigue
she
ate
with
surprising
relish
tough
fried
meat
and
large
wet
potatoes
a
bowl
of
raw
canned
tomatoes
and
a
huge
piece
of
pie
she
also
drank
with
no
effect
upon
her
drowsiness
an
enormous
thick
cupful
of
strong
coffee
slightly
tempered
by
canned
milk
she
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
long
table
opposite
lander
a
fat
man
whose
eyes
twinkled
with
a
look
of
mysterious
inner
amusement
caused
probably
by
astonishment
at
his
own
respectability
he
had
behind
him
a
career
of
unprecedented
villainy
and
that
he
should
end
here
at
rusty
as
the
solid
and
keeper
of
the
roadhouse
was
no
doubt
a
perpetual
tickle
to
his
consciousness
down
either
side
of
the
table
were
silent
and
impressive
figures
busy
with
their
food
courteous
and
quiet
they
were
and
beautifully
uninquiring
except
in
the
matter
of
her
supplies
the
yellow
lamplight
shone
on
brown
bearded
and
brown
faces
rugged
and
strong
and
these
bared
throats
and
thickly
thatched
heads
these
faces
lighted
by
extraordinary
brilliant
brooding
eyes
reminded
sheila
of
a
master
painting
of
the
last
supper
so
did
their
coarse
clothing
melt
into
the
shadows
of
the
room
and
so
did
their
hands
and
throats
and
faces
pick
themselves
out
in
mellow
lights
and
darknesses
after
the
meal
she
dragged
herself
upstairs
to
number
five
made
scant
use
of
nicked
basin
spoutless
pitcher
and
rough
clean
towel
blew
out
her
little
shadeless
lamp
and
crept
in
under
an
immense
elephantine
grateful
weight
of
blankets
and
patchwork
quilts
none
too
fresh
probably
though
the
sheet
blankets
were
evidently
newly
washed
of
muslin
sheeting
there
was
none
the
pillow
was
flat
and
musty
sheila
cuddled
into
it
as
though
it
had
been
a
mother
shoulder
that
instant
she
was
asleep
once
in
the
night
she
woke
a
dream
waked
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
great
white
flower
had
blossomed
in
the
window
of
her
room
and
that
in
the
heart
of
it
was
dickie
face
tender
and
as
pale
as
a
petal
it
drew
near
to
her
and
bent
over
her
wistfully
she
held
out
her
arms
with
a
piteous
longing
to
comfort
his
wistfulness
and
woke
her
face
was
wet
with
the
mystery
of
dream
tears
the
flower
dwindled
to
a
small
white
moon
standing
high
in
the
upper
pane
of
one
of
the
uncurtained
windows
the
room
was
full
of
eager
mountain
air
she
could
hear
a
turning
with
a
soft
splash
in
the
stream
below
there
was
no
other
sound
the
room
smelt
of
snowy
heights
and
brilliant
stars
she
breathed
deep
and
quite
as
though
she
had
breathed
a
narcotic
slept
suddenly
again
this
before
any
memory
of
hudson
burned
her
consciousness
the
next
morning
she
found
that
her
journey
had
been
carefully
arranged
thatcher
had
come
and
gone
the
responsibility
for
her
further
progress
had
been
shifted
to
the
shoulders
of
a
teamster
whose
bearded
face
except
for
the
immense
humor
and
gallantry
of
his
gray
eyes
was
startlingly
like
one
of
albrecht
dürer
apostles
her
bundle
was
in
his
wagon
half
of
his
front
seat
was
cushioned
for
her
after
breakfast
she
was
again
escorted
down
the
board
walk
to
the
gate
lander
fastened
a
huge
bunch
of
sweet
peas
to
her
coat
and
kissed
her
cheek
sheila
bade
innumerable
expressed
innumerable
thanks
for
absence
rusty
offered
its
apologies
they
said
that
he
had
been
much
entertained
and
after
the
hurt
he
had
suffered
to
his
wrist
late
sleep
was
a
necessity
sheila
understood
the
bowl
of
reparation
had
been
emptied
to
its
last
atoning
dregs
she
mounted
to
the
side
of
saint
mark
she
bowed
and
smiled
made
promises
gave
thanks
again
and
waved
herself
out
of
rusty
at
last
she
had
never
felt
so
flattered
and
so
warmed
at
heart
i
agoin

until

river

next
spring
by
god

have
to
excuse
me
again
lady
he
seemed
rather
mournfully
surprised
by
the
frequent
need
for
these
apologies
it
was
my
raisin
lady
he
explained
my
father
was
a
methody
preacher

to

he
wiped
his
forehead
i
reckon
i
better
keep
still
sheila
struggled
then
gave
way
to
mirth
her
companion
after
a
doubtful
look
relaxed
into
his
wide
bearded
smile
after
that
matters
were
on
an
easy
footing
between
them
and
the
excuse
me
lady
was
for
the
most
part
left
to
her
understanding
they
drifted
like
a
lurching
vessel
through
the
long
crystal
day
never
before
this
journey
into
hidden
creek
had
time
meant
anything
to
sheila
but
a
series
of
incidents
occupations
or
emotions
now
first
she
understood
the
greek
impersonation
of
the
dancing
hours
she
had
watched
the
varying
faces
the
day
turns
to
those
who
fold
their
hands
and
still
their
minds
to
watch
its
progress
she
had
seen
the
gradual
heightening
of
brilliance
from
dawn
to
noon
and
then
the
from
that
high
glare
through
gold
and
rose
and
salmon
and
purple
to
the
ashy
lavenders
of
twilight
and
so
into
gray
and
the
metallic
glittering
coldness
of
the
mountain
night
it
was
the
purple
hour
when
she
said
to
saint
mark
on
the
far
side
of
a
swift
and
perilous
ford
she
was
left
standing
in
the
shadow
of
a
while
he
rode
away
into
the
still
golden
expanse
of
valley
beyond
the
leafy
course
of
the
stream
hidden
creek
had
narrowed
and
deepened
it
ran
past
sheila
now
with
a
loud
clapping
and
knocking
at
its
cobbled
bed
and
with
an
of
noisy
murmurs
the
hurrying
water
was
purple
with
flecks
of
lavender
and
gold
the
trees
on
its
banks
were
topped
with
emerald
fire
where
they
caught
the
light
of
the
sun
the
trail
to
miss
ranch
ran
along
the
river
on
the
edge
of
a
forest
of
pines
at
this
hour
they
looked
like
a
wall
into
which
some
magic
permitted
the
wanderer
to
walk
interminably
sheila
was
glad
that
she
did
not
have
to
make
use
of
this
wizard
invitation
she
cached
her
bundle
as
saint
mark
had
advised
in
a
thicket
near
the
stream
and
walked
resolutely
forward
along
the
trail
not
even
when
her
pony
had
left
her
on
the
hill
had
she
felt
so
desolate
or
so
afraid
she
could
not
understand
why
she
was
here
on
her
way
to
the
ranch
of
this
strange
woman
she
felt
astonished
by
her
loneliness
by
her
rashness
by
the
dreadful
lack
in
her
life
of
all
the
usual
protections
was
youth
meant
so
to
venture
itself
this
was
what
young
men
had
done
since
the
beginning
of
time
she
thought
of
hilliard
his
life
must
have
been
just
such
a
series
of
disconnected
experiments
danger
was
in
the
very
pattern
of
such
freedom
but
she
was
a
girl
a
girl
as
the
familiar
phrase
expresses
it
a
girl
she
was
reminded
of
a
pathetic
and
familiar
line
a
woman
naturally
born
to
fears
a
wholesome
reaction
to
pride
followed
and
suddenly
an
amusing
memory
of
miss
blake
of
her
corduroy
trousers
stuffed
into
boots
of
her
broad
strong
body
her
square
face
with
its
firm
lips
and
masterful
eyes
a
very
heartening
memory
for
such
a
moment
here
was
a
woman
that
had
adventured
without
fear
and
had
quite
evidently
met
with
no
disaster
sheila
came
to
a
little
tumbling
tributary
and
crossed
it
on
a
log
on
the
farther
side
the
trail
broadened
grew
more
distinct
through
an
opening
in
tall
gray
misty
cottonwoods
she
saw
the
corner
of
a
log
house
at
the
same
instant
a
dreadful
tumult
broke
out
the
sound
sent
sheila
blood
in
a
slapping
wave
back
upon
her
heart
all
of
her
body
turned
cold
she
was
fastened
by
stone
feet
to
the
ground
it
was
the
laughter
of
a
mob
of
damned
souls
an
inhuman
despairing
mockery
of
god
it
tore
the
quiet
evening
into
shreds
of
fear
this
house
was
a
madhouse
holding
revelry
no
of
course
they
were
wolves
a
pack
of
wolves
then
with
a
warmth
of
returning
circulation
sheila
remembered
miss
blake
dogs
the
descendants
of
the
that
had
littered
on
the
body
of
a
dead
man
was
it
these
voices
had
no
hint
of
the
homely
barking
of
a
watchdog
the
friend
of
man
loneliness
but
sheila
braced
her
courage
miss
blake
made
good
use
of
her
pack
they
pulled
her
sled
winters
in
hidden
creek
they
must
then
be
partly
civilized
by
service
if
only
she
smiled
a
desperate
smile
at
the
uncertainty
they
did
tear
her
to
pieces
when
she
came
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
trees
there
was
very
great
courage
in
sheila
short
lonely
march
through
the
little
grove
of
cottonwood
trees
she
was
as
white
as
the
mountain
columbine
she
walked
slowly
and
held
her
head
high
she
had
taken
up
a
stone
for
comfort
at
the
end
of
the
trees
she
saw
a
house
a
building
of
logs
very
pleasantly
set
in
a
circle
of
aspen
trees
backed
by
taller
firs
toppling
over
which
stood
a
great
sharp
crest
of
rocky
ledges
nine
thousand
feet
high
edged
with
the
fire
of
sunset
at
one
side
of
the
house
eight
big
dogs
were
leaping
at
the
ends
of
their
chains
they
were
tied
to
trees
or
to
small
kennels
at
the
foot
of
trees
and
god
be
thanked
sheila
let
fall
her
stone
they
were
tied
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
nearest
wing
of
the
house
opened
and
miss
blake
stood
on
the
threshold
and
held
up
her
hands
at
sight
of
her
the
dogs
stopped
their
howling
instantly
and
cringed
on
their
bellies
or
sat
yawning
on
their
bushy
haunches
miss
blake
resonant
deep
voice
seemed
to
pounce
upon
sheila
above
the
chatter
of
the
stream
which
running
about
three
sides
of
the
glade
was
now
at
the
silence
of
the
dogs
incessantly
audible
well
if
it
is
the
little
barmaid
cried
miss
blake
and
advanced
wiping
her
hand
on
a
white
apron
tied
absurdly
over
the
corduroy
trousers
and
cowboy
boots
well
if
you
are
as
welcome
as
the
flowers
in
may
so
you
thought
you
leave
the
and
come
take
a
look
at
the
stars
they
met
and
sheila
took
the
strong
square
hand
she
was
afflicted
by
a
sudden
dizziness
that
it
she
faltered
this
time
i
thought
i
try
the
stars
with
that
she
fell
against
miss
blake
and
felt
just
before
she
dropped
into
blackness
that
she
had
been
saved
by
firm
arms
from
falling
to
the
ground
chapter
iv
beasts
the
city
rippled
into
light
it
bloomed
blossom
on
blossom
like
some
enchanted
jungle
under
the
heavy
summer
sky
dickie
sat
on
a
bench
in
washington
square
he
sat
forward
his
hands
hanging
between
his
knees
his
lips
parted
and
he
watched
the
night
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
filled
with
the
clamor
of
beasts
running
to
and
fro
after
their
prey
the
heat
was
a
humid
solid
breathless
weight
a
heat
unknown
to
millings
dickie
wore
his
threadbare
blue
serge
suit
it
felt
like
a
garment
of
lead
there
were
other
people
on
the
benches
limp
and
sodden
outlines
dickie
had
glanced
at
them
and
had
glanced
away
he
did
not
want
to
think
that
he
looked
like
one
of
these
insects
bruised
into
immobility
a
bus
swept
round
the
corner
and
moved
with
a
sort
of
topheavy
tipsy
dignity
under
the
white
arch
it
was
loaded
with
humanity
its
top
black
with
heads
it
ai
a
crowd
thought
dickie
it
a
swarm
his
eyes
followed
the
ragged
why
is
it
so
horrible
he
asked
himself
horrible
and
beautiful
and
sort
of
poisonous
it
plumb
scares
a
fellow
a
diminished
moon
battered
and
dim
like
a
trodden
silver
coin
stood
up
above
him
by
tilting
his
head
he
could
look
directly
at
it
through
an
opening
in
the
dusty
boughs
the
stars
were
here
and
there
in
the
dense
sky
the
city
flaunted
its
easy
splendor
triumphantly
before
their
pallid
insignificance
tarnished
purities
forgotten
ecstasies
inspirations
so
the
city
shouted
raucously
to
its
faded
firmament
dickie
fingers
slid
into
his
pocket
the
moon
had
reminded
him
of
his
one
remaining
dime
he
might
have
bought
a
night
lodging
with
it
but
after
one
experience
of
such
lodgings
he
preferred
his
present
quarters
in
dickie
mind
there
was
no
association
of
shame
or
ignominy
with
a
night
spent
under
the
sky
but
fear
and
ignominy
tainted
and
clung
to
his
memory
of
that
other
night
he
had
saved
his
dime
deliberately
going
hungry
rather
than
admit
to
himself
that
he
was
absolutely
at
the
end
of
his
resources
he
would
not
especially
need
that
dime
he
had
a
job
he
would
begin
to
draw
pay
in
his
own
phrasing
he
would
buy
him
a
square
meal
and
rent
him
a
room
somewhere
upon
these
two
prospects
his
brain
fastened
with
a
persistency
and
yet
above
anything
he
had
faced
in
his
life
he
dreaded
the
job
and
the
room
the
inspiration
of
his
flight
the
impulse
that
had
sped
him
out
of
millings
like
a
arrow
that
determination
to
find
sheila
to
rehabilitate
himself
in
her
esteem
to
serve
her
to
make
a
fresh
start
had
fallen
from
him
like
a
dead
flame
the
was
spent
he
had
not
found
sheila
he
had
no
way
of
finding
her
she
was
not
at
her
old
address
her
father
friend
the
hazeldean
that
had
brought
sylvester
to
marcus
studio
knew
nothing
of
her
halligan
her
former
landlady
knew
nothing
of
her
dickie
having
summoned
halligan
to
her
doorsill
had
looked
past
her
up
the
narrow
steep
staircase
did
she
live
away
up
there
he
had
asked
yes
sorr
and
was
a
climb
for
the
poor
little
crayture
but
there
was
days
when
she
come
down
it
like
a
burrd
to
meet
her
dickie
had
faltered
white
and
before
the
kindly
irishwoman
who
remembered
so
vividly
sheila
downward
winged
rush
of
welcome
for
several
hours
after
his
visit
to
the
studio
building
he
had
wandered
aimlessly
about
then
his
hunger
had
bitten
at
him
and
he
had
begun
to
look
for
work
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
a
small
restaurant
displayed
a
need
of
waiters
dickie
applied
he
had
often
helped
out
in
that
capacity
as
in
most
others
at
the
aura
he
cited
his
experience
referred
to
hazeldean
and
was
engaged
the
pay
seemed
to
him
sufficient
to
maintain
life
so
much
for
that
then
he
went
to
his
bench
and
watched
the
day
pant
itself
into
the
night
his
loneliness
was
a
pitiful
thing
his
utter
lack
of
hope
or
inspiration
was
a
terrible
thing
but
as
the
night
went
slowly
by
he
faced
this
desolation
with
extraordinary
fortitude
it
was
part
of
that
curious
detachment
that
strange
gift
of
impersonal
observation
dickie
bore
no
grudges
against
life
his
spirit
had
a
fashion
of
standing
away
tiptoe
on
wings
it
stood
so
now
like
a
presence
above
the
miserable
body
that
occupied
the
bench
and
suffered
the
sultriness
of
august
and
the
pains
of
abstinence
dickie
wide
eyes
that
watched
the
city
and
found
it
horrible
and
beautiful
and
frightening
were
entirely
empty
of
bitterness
and
of
they
had
a
sort
of
wistful
patience
there
came
at
last
a
cool
little
wind
and
under
its
ministration
dickie
let
fall
his
head
on
his
arms
and
slept
he
was
blessed
by
a
dream
shallow
water
clapping
over
a
cobbled
bed
the
sharp
rustle
of
aspen
leaves
and
two
stars
tender
and
misty
that
bent
close
and
smiled
he
woke
up
and
stared
at
the
city
he
got
up
and
walked
about
he
was
faint
now
and
felt
chilled
although
the
asphalt
was
still
soft
underfoot
and
smelled
of
hot
tar
as
he
moved
listlessly
along
the
pavement
a
girl
brushed
against
him
looked
up
and
murmured
to
him
she
was
small
and
slight
his
heart
seemed
to
leap
away
from
the
contact
and
then
to
leap
almost
irresistibly
to
meet
it
he
turned
away
and
went
back
quickly
toward
the
square
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
followed
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
furtively
but
the
girl
had
disappeared
and
there
was
no
one
in
sight
but
a
man
who
walked
unsteadily
dickie
suddenly
knew
why
he
had
saved
that
dime
the
energy
of
a
definite
purpose
came
to
him
he
remembered
a
swinging
door
back
there
around
a
corner
but
when
he
reached
the
saloon
it
was
closed
dickie
had
a
humiliating
struggle
with
tears
he
went
back
to
his
bench
and
sat
there
trembling
and
swearing
softly
to
himself
he
had
not
the
strength
to
look
farther
he
was
no
longer
the
dickie
of
millings
a
creature
possessed
of
loneliness
and
vacancy
and
wandering
fancies
he
was
no
longer
lover
he
was
a
prey
to
strong
desires
in
truth
thought
dickie
seeking
even
now
with
his
deprecatory
smile
for
likenesses
and
words
the
city
was
full
of
beasts
silent
and
stealthy
and
fanged
that
spirit
aloof
maintained
its
sweet
detachment
beneath
its
observation
dickie
fought
with
a
grim
unreasoning
panic
that
was
very
like
the
fear
of
a
man
pursued
by
wolves
chapter

even
in
the
shadow
of
after
events
those
first
two
months
at
miss
blake
ranch
swam
like
a
golden
galleon
through
sheila
memory
never
had
she
felt
such
of

soul
never
had
she
known
such
dawns
and
days
such

such

came
like
a
highwayman
to
hold
up
an
eager
traveler

came
irresistibly
it

her
up
out
of
life
as
it
catches
up
a
healthy
child
never
before
had
she
worked
so
heartily
out
of

in
the
vegetable
garden
indoors
in
the
sunny
kitchen
its
windows
and
door
open
to
the
tonic

never
before
had
she
eaten
so
heartily
nothing
had
tasted
like
the
trout
they
caught
in
hidden
creek
like
the
juicy
sweet
vegetables
they
picked
from
their
own
laborious
rows
like
the
berries
they
gathered
in
nervous
anticipation
of
that
rival

casual
treatment
of
her
her
curt
commands
her
cordial
bullying
were
a
rest
to
nerves
more
raveled
than
sheila
knew
from
her
experience
in
millings
she
grew
rosy
brown
her
hair
seemed
to
sparkle
along
its
crisp
ripples
her
little
throat
filled
itself
out
round
and
firm
she
walked
with
a
spring
and
a
swing
she
sang
and
whistled
no
hudson
near
to
scowl
at
her
was
not
drudgery
cooking
was
a
positive
pleasure
everything
smelt
so
good
she
was
always
shutting
her
eyes
to
enjoy
the
smell
of
things
forgetting
to
listen
in
order
to
taste
thoroughly
forgetting
to
look
in
the
delight
of
listening
to
such
musical
silences
and
forgetting
even
to
breathe
in
the
rapture
of
sight
miss
blake
and
she
put
up
preserves
and
sheila
had
to
invent
jests
to
find
some
pretext
for
her
laughter
so
ridiculous
was
the
look
of
that
broad
square
back
its
hair
short
above
the
flannel
collar
and
the
tied
pertly
above
the
very
wide
slightly
worn
corduroy
breeches
and
the
big
boots
sheila
was
always
thinking
of
a
certain
famous
puss
of
memory
and
biting
her
tongue
to
keep
it
from
the
epithet
after
hilliard
gave
her
the
black
horse
and
she
began
to
explore
the
mountain
game
trails
her
life
seemed
as
full
of
pleasantness
as
it
could
hold
and
yet
with
just
that
gift
of
hilliard
the
overshadowing
of
her
joy
began
no
really
before
that
with
his
first
visit
that
was
in
late
september
when
the
nights
were
frosty
and
miss
blake
had
begun
to
cut
and
stack
her
wood
for
winter
and
to
use
it
for
a
crackling
after
supper
they
were
sitting
before
such
a
fire
when
hilliard
came
miss
blake
sat
on
the
middle
of
her
spine
her
legs
crossed
a
magazine
in
her
hands
and
on
her
blunt
nose
a
pair
of
large
spectacles
her
feet
and
hands
and
her
cropped
head
though
big
for
a
woman
looked
absurdly
small
in
comparison
to
the
breadth
of
her
hips
and
shoulders
she
was
reading
the
popular
science
monthly
this
and
the
geographic
and
current
events
were
regularly
taken
by
her
and
most
thoroughly
digested
she
read
with
keen
intelligence
her
comments
were
as
shrewd
as
a
the
chair
she
sat
in
was
made
from
and
looked
like
the
throne
of
some
norse
chieftain
behind
her
on
the
wall
hung
the
stuffed
head
of
a
huge
walrus
his
tusks
gleaming
the
gift
of
that
exploring
brother
who
seemed
to
be
her
only
living
relative
there
were
other
tokens
of
his
wanderings
a
skin
an
ivory
eskimo
spear
as
a
more
homelike
trophy
miss
blake
had
hung
an
elk
head
which
she
herself
had
laid
low
a
very
creditable
shot
though
out
of
season
she
had
been
short
of
meat
in
the
corner
was
a
pianola
topped
by
piles
of
at
her
feet
lay
berg
the
dog
snoring
faintly
and
as
cozy
as
a
kitten
the
firelight
made
miss
blake
face
and
hair
ruddier
than
usual
her
eyes
when
she
raised
them
for
a
glance
at
sheila
looked
as
though
they
were
full
of
red
sparks
which
might
at
any
instant
break
into
flame
sheila
was
wearing
one
of
her
flimsy
little
black
frocks
recovered
from
the
wrinkles
of
its
journey
and
she
had
decorated
her
neck
with
some
yellow
flowers
on
these
miss
blake
eyes
rested
every
now
and
then
with
a
sardonic
gleam
outside
hidden
creek
told
its
interminable
chattering
tale
centuries
long
the
little
skinny
horse
cropped
getting
his
difficult
meal
with
his
few
remaining
teeth
they
could
hear
the
dogs
move
with
a
faint
rattle
of
chains
sometimes
there
would
be
a
distant
rushing
sound
a
thousands
of
feet
above
their
heads
on
the
mountain
above
these
familiar
sounds
there
came
at
about
eight
that
evening
the
rattle
of
horse
hoofs
through
the
little
stream
and
at
the
instant
broke
out
the
hideous
clamor
of
the
dogs
a
noise
that
never
failed
to
whiten
sheila
cheeks
miss
blake
sat
up
straight
and
snatched
off
her
spectacles
she
looked
at
sheila
with
a
hard
look
have
you
been
sending
out
invitations
sheila
she
asked
no
of
course
not
sheila
had
flushed
she
could
guess
whose
hoofs
were
trotting
across
the
little
clearing
a
man
voice
spoke
to
the
dogs
commandingly
miss
blake
eyebrows
came
down
over
her
eyes
a
man
step
struck
the
porch
a
man
knock
rapped
sharply
at
the
door
come
in
said
miss
blake
she
spoke
it
like
a
sentry
challenge
the
door
opened
and
there
stood
cosme
hilliard
hat
in
hand
his
smiling
latin
mouth
showing
the
big
white
saxon
teeth
sheila
had
not
before
quite
realized
his
good
looks
now
all
his
lithe
long
gracefulness
was
painted
for
her
against
a
square
of
purple
night
the
clean
white
silk
shirt
fitted
his
broad
shoulders
the
wide
belt
clung
to
his
supple
waist
the
leather
chaps
were
shaped
to
his
greek
hips
and
thighs
no
civilized
man
costume
could
so
have
revealed
and
enhanced
his
beautiful
strength
and
above
the
long
body
his
face
glowed
with
its
vivid
coloring
the
liquid
golden
eyes
that
moved
easily
under
their
lids
the
polished
black
hair
sleekly
brushed
the
cheeks
the
bright
lips
flexible
and
curved
of
his
spanish
mother
who
in
god
name
are
you
demanded
miss
blake
in
her
deepest
voice
this
is
hilliard
sheila
came
forward
he
is
the
man
that
brought
me
over
the
hill
miss
blake
after
i
lost
my
horse
you
know
there
was
some
urgency
in
sheila
tone
a
sort
of
prod
to
courtesy
miss
blake
settled
back
on
her
spine
and
recrossed
her
legs
well
come
in
she
said
and
shut
the
door
no
use
frosting
us
all
is
there
she
resumed
her
spectacles
and
her
reading
of
the
popular
science
monthly
hilliard
still
smiling
bowed
to
her
took
sheila
hand
for
an
instant
then
moved
easily
across
the
room
and
settled
on
his
heels
at
one
corner
of
the
hearth
he
had
been
riding
it
would
seem
in
the
thin
silk
shirt
and
had
found
the
night
air
crisp
he
rolled
a
cigarette
with
the
hands
that
had
first
drawn
sheila
notice
as
they
held
his
glass
on
the
bar
gentleman
hands
clever
sensitive
carefully
kept
from
his
occupation
he
looked
up
at
miss
blake
audaciously
you
better
make
friends
with
me
he
said
because
we
going
to
be
neighbors
how
that
i
taking
up
my
homestead
right
down
here
below
you
on
hidden
creek
a
ways
about
six
miles
below
your
ford
miss
blake
face
filled
with
dark
blood
she
said
nothing
put
up
her
magazine
sheila
however
exclaimed
delightedly
taken
up
a
homestead
yes
he
turned
his
floating
glowing
look
to
her
and
there
it
stayed
almost
without
deviation
during
the
rest
of
his
visit
i
built
me
a
log
house
a
dandy
i
had
a
man
up
from
rusty
to
help
me
bought
me
a
cow
i
getting
my
furnishings
ready
that
what
i
been
doing
these
two
months
and
never
rode
up
to
call
on
us
sheila
reproached
him
no
i
tell
you
the
reason
for
that
i
was
sure
of
myself
she
opened
rather
puzzled
and
astonished
eyes
at
this
but
for
an
instant
his
look
went
beyond
her
and
remembered
troubling
things
you
see
miss
arundel
i
not
used
to
settling
down
that
something
that
i
had
no
practice
in
i
impatient
i
get
tired
quickly
damn
quickly
i
change
my
mind
it
the
worst
thing
in
me
a
sort
of
always
thirsty
for
new
things
it
touch
and
go
with
him
he
runs
with
me
you
see
i
always
given
him
his
head
his
look
had
come
back
to
her
face
and
dwelt
there
speaking
for
him
a
language
headier
than
that
of
his
tongue
i
thought
i
tie
the
dern
fool
down
to
some
good
tough
work
and
test
him
out
well
he
has
quit
on
me
this
time
i
think
he
wo
i
got
a
ball
and
chain
round
about
that
cloven
foot
he
drew
at
his
cigarette
in
smoke
the
ardor
of
his
look
i
like
to
show
you
my
house
miss
arundel
it
fine
i
worked
with
a
builder
one
season
when
i
was
a
lad
i
got
it
peeled
inside
the
logs
shine
and
i
got
a
fireplace
twice
the
size
of
this
in
my
he
made
graceful
gestures
with
the
hand
that
held
the
cigarette
yes
a
and
a
kitchen
and
with
a
whimsical
smile
a
pantry
and
oh
a
great
big
bedroom
that
gets
the
morning
sun
he
paused
an
instant
and
flushed
from
chin
to
brow
an
flush
it
was
but
the
bold
latin
eyes
did
not
fall
i
made
some
furnishings
already
and
i
sent
out
an
order
for
kitchen
stuff
here
miss
blake
changed
the
crossing
of
her
legs
sheila
was
angry
with
herself
because
she
was
consumed
with
the
contagion
of
his
blush
she
wished
that
he
would
not
look
as
if
he
had
seen
the
blush
and
was
pleased
by
it
she
wished
that
his
clean
young
strength
and
beauty
and
the
ardor
of
his
eyes
did
not
speak
quite
so
eloquently
i
bought
a
little
black
horse
about
so
high
he
held
his
hand
an
absurd
distance
from
the
floor
and
laughed
just
the
size
for
a
little
girl
and
do
you
know
who
i
going
to
give
him
to
here
miss
blake
got
up
strode
to
the
pianola
adjusted
it
and
sat
down
broad
and
solid
and
unabashed
by
absence
of
feminine
draperies
upon
the
stool
she
played
a
comic
song
i
do
like
your
in
some
such
dreadful
way
it
expressed
itself
they
do
look
good
to
me
i
do
think
your
john
ever
a
collar
on
she
played
it
very
loud
hilliard
stood
up
and
came
close
to
sheila
she
mad
as
a
march
hare
he
whispered
and
she
does
like
me
a
little
bit
come
out
while
i
patch
up
dusty
wo
you
please
moonlight
i
be
going
he
repeated
this
very
loud
for
miss
benefit
with
no
apparent
effect
upon
her
enjoyment
of
the
song
she
was
rocking
to
its
rhythm
hilliard
was
overwhelmed
suddenly
by
the
appearance
of
her
he
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
bolted
sheila
following
found
him
around
the
corner
of
the
house
rocking
and
gasping
with
mirth
he
looked
at
her
through
tears
he
gasped
and
sheila
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
to
be
safe
in
a
mighty
there
they
crouched
like
two
children
till
their
laughter
spent
itself
hilliard
was
serious
first
you
a
bad
ungrateful
girl
he
said
weakly
to
laugh
at
a
sweet
old
lady
like
that
oh
i
am
sheila
took
it
almost
seriously
she
been
wonderful
to
me
i
bet
she
works
you
he
said
jealously
oh
no
not
a
bit
too
hard
i
love
it
well
he
admitted
you
do
look
pretty
fine
that
a
fact
better
than
you
did
at
hudson
what
did
you
quit
for
sheila
was
sober
enough
now
the
moonlight
let
some
of
its
silver
uncaught
by
the
twinkling
aspen
leaves
splash
down
on
her
face
it
seemed
to
flicker
and
quiver
like
the
leaves
she
shook
her
head
he
looked
a
trifle
sullen
oh
you
wo
tell
me
funny
idea
you
being
a
barmaid
hudson
notion
was
it
sheila
lifted
her
clear
eyes
i
thought
asking
questions
was
good
manners
in
the
west
damn
he
said
do
you
make
me
angry
i
got
a
right
to
ask
you
questions
she
put
her
hand
up
against
the
smooth
white
trunk
of
the
tree
near
which
she
stood
she
seemed
to
grow
a
little
taller
oh
have
you
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
how
you
got
any
such
right
and
you
like
to
be
questioned
yourself
she
had
him
there
had
him
rather
cruelly
though
he
was
not
aware
of
the
weapon
of
her
suspicion
she
felt
a
little
ashamed
when
she
saw
him
wince
he
slapped
his
gloves
against
his
leather
chaps
looking
at
her
with
hot
sulky
eyes
oh
well
i
beg
your
pardon
listen
he
flung
his
aside
and
was
sweet
and
cool
again
like
the
night
are
you
going
to
take
the
little
horse
i
do
know
his
face
shadowed
and
fell
so
expressively
so
utterly
that
she
melted
oh
he
stammered
from
her
i
was
sure
i
brought
him
up
this
completed
the
melting
process
of
course
i
take
him
she
cried
where
is
he
she
inspected
the
beautiful
little
animal
by
the
moonlight
she
even
let
hilliard
mount
her
on
the
shining
glossy
back
and
rode
slowly
about
clinging
to
his
mane
ecstatic
over
the
rippling
movement
under
her
he
like
a
said
cosme
you
can
ride
him
all
day
and
not
feel
it
he
looked
about
the
silver
meadow
good
feed
here
there
i
bet
he
stay
if
not
i
get
him
for
you
sheila
slipped
down
they
left
the
horse
to
graze
yes
it
feed
do
you
think
miss
blake
will
let
me
keep
him
his
answer
was
entirely
lost
by
a
sudden
outbreak
from
the
dogs
good
lord
said
cosme
making
himself
heard
what
a
breed
is
that
awful
why
does
she
keep
the
brutes
is
she
scared
they
eat
her
sheila
shook
her
head
presently
the
tumult
quieted
down
they
afraid
of
her
she
said
she
has
a
dreadful
whip
she
likes
to
bully
them
i
think
she
rather
cruel
but
she
does
love
berg
she
says
he
the
only
real
dog
in
the
pack
was
berg
the
one
on
the
bearskin
inside
yes
he
sure
a
beauty
but
i
do
like
him
he
has
wolf
eyes
see
here
you
shivering
i
kept
you
out
here
in
the
cold
i
go
thank
you
for
keeping
the
horse
will
you
come
down
to
see
my
house
i
built
it
he
drawled
the
words
for
you
and
added
after
a
tingling
moment
to
see
this
experiment
in
words
sent
sheila
to
the
house
her
hand
crushed
and
aching
with
his
grasp
her
heart
jumping
with
a
queer
fright
miss
blake
stood
astraddle
on
the
hearth
her
hands
behind
her
back
you
better
go
to
bed
sheila
she
said
it
eleven
and
her
voice
was
pleasant
enough
but
its
bluffness
had
a
new
edge
sheila
found
it
easy
to
obey
she
climbed
up
the
ladder
to
the
little
gabled
loft
which
was
her
bedroom
halfway
up
she
paused
to
assert
a
belated
independence
of
spirit
she
said
how
do
you
like
our
neighbor
miss
blake
stared
up
her
lips
were
set
tight
she
made
no
answer
after
an
instant
she
sauntered
across
the
room
and
out
of
the
door
the
whip
with
which
she
beat
the
dogs
swung
in
her
hand
a
moment
later
a
fearful
howling
and
yelping
showed
that
some
culprit
had
been
chosen
for
condign
punishment
sheila
set
down
her
candle
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
cot
and
covered
her
ears
with
her
hands
when
it
was
over
she
crept
into
bed
she
felt
though
she
chided
herself
for
the
absurdity
like
a
naughty
child
who
has
been
forcibly
reminded
of
the
consequences
of
rebellion
chapter
vi
a
history
and
a
letter
the
next
morning
it
seemed
miss
blake
humor
had
completely
changed
it
showed
something
like
an
apologetic
softness
she
patted
shoulder
when
she
passed
the
girl
at
work
when
hilliard
next
appeared
a
morning
visit
this
time
he
was
bidden
to
share
their
dinner
he
was
even
smiled
upon
she
not
such
a
bad
old
girl
is
she
he
admitted
when
sheila
had
been
given
a
and
was
riding
on
the
black
horse
beside
hilliard
on
his
dusty
across
one
of
the
mountain
meadows
think
she
a
dear
said
sheila
pink
with
gratitude
then
shadowing
if
only
she
would
beat
the
dogs
and
would
give
up
trapping
why
in
thunder
should
she
trap
i
loathe
trapping
do
you
remember
how
you
felt
in
the
pen
it
bad
enough
to
shoot
down
splendid
wild
things
for
food
but
to
trap
them
small
furry
things
or
even
big
furry
things
like
bears
why
cruel
it
hideously
cruel
when
a
woman
does
it
come
now
do
call
a
woman
yes
she
is
think
of
the
aprons
and
she
is
so
tidy
that
not
just
a
woman
virtue
maybe
not
i
not
sure
but
i
a
feeling
that
it
was
eve
who
first
discovered
dust
very
bad
job
if
she
did
think
of
all
the
bother
we
been
going
through
ever
since
there
sheila
triumphed
to
you
it
just
bother
you
a
man
to
me
it
a
form
of
sport
i
wonder
what
miss
blake
story
is
you
mean
he
turned
in
his
saddle
to
stare
wonderingly
at
her
you
do
know
no
sheila
blushed
confusedly
i
i
do
know
anything
about
her
good
lord
he
whistled
softly
sometimes
those
ventures
turn
out
all
right
he
looked
dubious
i
glad
i
here
sheila
smile
slipped
sweetly
across
her
mouth
and
eyes
so
am
i
but
she
added
after
a
thoughtful
moment
i
do
know
much
about
your
story
either
do
i
i
might
say
something
about
asking
questions
began
cosme
with
grimness
but
changed
his
tone
quickly
with
a
light
apologetic
touch
on
her
arm
but
but
i
wo
i
ran
away
from
school
when
i
was
fourteen
and
i
been
knocking
around
the
west
ever
since
what
school
asked
sheila
he
did
not
answer
for
several
minutes
they
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
meadow
and
were
mounting
a
slope
on
a
narrow
trail
where
the
ponies
seemed
to
nose
their
way
among
the
trees
now
and
then
sheila
had
to
put
out
her
hand
to
push
her
knee
away
from
a
threatening
trunk
below
were
the
vivid
paintbrush
flowers
and
the
blue
mountain
lupine
and
all
about
the
aspens
with
leaves
turning
to
restless
gold
against
the
sky
the
horses
moved
quietly
with
a
slight
creaking
of
saddles
there
was
a
feeling
of
stealth
of
mystery
that
tiptoe
breathless
expectation
of
pan
pipes
at
last
cosme
turned
in
his
saddle
rested
his
hand
on
the
cantle
and
looked
at
sheila
from
a
bent
face
with
troubled
eyes
it
was
an
eastern
school
he
said
no
doubt
you
heard
of
it
it
was
groton
the
name
here
in
these
wyoming
woods
brought
a
picture
as
foreign
as
the
artificiality
of
a
groton
you
ran
away
yes
sheila
suspicions
were
returning
forcibly
i
have
to
ask
questions
hilliard
because
it
seems
so
strange
what
you
are
now
and
your
running
away
and
never
having
been
brought
back
to
the
east
by
by
whoever
it
was
that
sent
you
to
groton
i
want
you
to
ask
questions
he
said
rather
wistfully
you
have
the
right
this
forced
her
into
something
of
a
dilemma
she
ignored
it
and
waited
looking
away
from
him
he
would
not
leave
her
this
loophole
however
why
do
you
look
at
me
he
demanded
crossly
she
did
and
smiled
again
you
have
the
prettiest
smile
i
ever
saw
he
cried
then
went
on
quickly
i
ran
away
because
of
something
that
happened
i
tell
you
my
mother
he
flushed
and
his
eyes
fell
came
up
to
see
me
at
school
one
day
my
mother
was
very
beautiful
i
was
mad
about
her
curiously
enough
every
trace
of
the
western
cowboy
had
gone
out
of
his
voice
and
manner
which
were
an
echo
of
the
voice
and
manner
of
the
groton
schoolboy
whose
experience
he
told
i
was
proud
of
her
you
know
how
a
kid
is
i
kind
of
paraded
her
round
and
showed
her
off
to
the
other
fellows
no
other
fellow
had
such
a
beautiful
mother
then
as
we
were
saying
a
crowd
of
the
boys
all
round
i
did
something
trod
on
her
foot
or
something
i
do
quite
know
what
and
she
lifted
up
her
hand
and
slapped
me
across
the
face
he
was
white
at
the
shocking
memory
right
there
before
them
all
when
i
i
was
adoring
her
she
had
the
temper
of
a
devil
a
sudden
spanish
temper
the
kind
i
have
too
and
she
never
made
the
slightest
effort
to
hold
it
down
she
hit
me
and
she
laughed
as
though
it
was
funny
and
she
got
into
her
carriage
i
cut
off
to
my
room
i
wanted
to
kill
myself
i
could
face
any
one
i
wanted
never
to
see
her
again
i
guess
i
was
a
queer
sort
of
kid
i
know
he
drew
a
big
breath
dropped
back
to
the
present
and
his
vivid
color
returned
that
why
i
ran
away
from
school
miss
arundel
and
they
never
brought
you
back
he
laughed
they
never
found
me
i
had
quite
a
lot
of
money
and
i
lost
myself
pretty
cleverly
a
boy
of
fourteen
can
you
know
a
very
common
history
well
i
suppose
they
did
break
their
necks
over
me
either
after
the
first
panic
they
were
busy
people
my
parents
remarkably
busy
going
to
the
devil
and
they
were
eternally
you
see
my
grandfather
had
the
money
still
has
it
and
remarkably
tight
i
wrote
to
them
after
six
years
when
i
was
twenty
they
wrote
back
at
least
their
lawyer
did
they
tried
not
very
sincerely
though
i
think
to
coax
me
east
again
told
me
double
my
allowance
if
i
did
they
sent
me
a
pittance
he
shuddered
suddenly
a
violent
primitive
shiver
i
glad
i
did
go
he
said
there
was
a
long
stillness
that
dreadful
climax
to
the
special
business
of
the
hilliards
was
relived
in
both
their
memories
but
it
was
something
of
which
neither
could
speak
sheila
wondered
if
the
beautiful
mother
was
that
instant
wearing
the
hideous
prison
dress
she
wished
that
she
had
read
the
result
of
the
trial
she
would
for
the
world
question
this
pale
and
silent
young
man
the
rest
of
their
ride
was
quiet
and
rather
mournful
they
rode
back
at
sunset
and
hilliard
bade
her
a
troubled
she
wanted
to
say
something
comforting
reassuring
she
watched
him
helplessly
from
where
she
stood
on
the
porch
as
he
walked
across
the
clearing
to
his
horse
suddenly
he
slapped
the
pocket
of
his
chaps
and
turned
back
thunder
he
cried
i
forgotten
the
mail
a
fellow
left
it
at
the
ford
a
paper
for
miss
blake
and
a
letter
for
you
sheila
held
out
her
hand
a
letter
for
me
she
took
it
it
was
a
strange
hand
small
and
rather
unsteady
the
envelope
was
fat
the
postmark
millings
her
flush
of
surprise
ebbed
she
knew
whose
letter
it
was
sylvester
hudson
he
had
found
her
out
she
did
not
even
notice
cosme
departure
she
went
up
to
her
loft
sat
down
on
her
cot
and
read
my
dear
miss
sheila
i
do
rightly
know
how
to
express
myself
in
this
letter
because
i
know
what
your
feelings
toward
pap
must
be
like
and
they
are
fierce
but
i
have
got
to
try
to
write
you
a
letter
just
the
same
for
there
are
some
things
that
need
explaining
at
first
when
my
hotel
and
my
aura
were
burned
down
here
the
writing
was
especially
shaky
and
i
found
that
you
and
dickie
had
both
vamoosed
i
thought
that
you
had
paid
me
out
and
gone
off
together
you
ca
blame
me
for
that
thought
miss
sheila
for
i
had
found
him
in
your
room
at
that
time
of
night
or
morning
and
i
could
help
but
see
that
he
was
aiming
to
kiss
you
and
you
were
waiting
for
his
kiss
so
i
was
angry
and
i
had
been
drinking
and
i
kissed
you
myself
taking
advantage
of
you
in
a
way
that
no
gentleman
would
do
but
i
thought
you
were
different
from
the
sheila
i
had
brought
to
be
my
barmaid
well
for
a
while
after
the
fire
i
was
pretty
near
crazy
i
was
about
loco
then
i
was
sick
when
i
got
well
again
a
fellow
who
come
over
from
hidden
creek
told
me
you
had
gone
over
to
be
at
a
ranch
there
and
that
you
had
come
in
alone
that
sort
of
got
me
to
thinking
about
you
more
and
more
and
studying
you
out
and
i
begun
to
see
that
i
had
made
a
bad
mistake
whatsoever
reason
brought
that
damn
fool
dickie
to
your
room
that
morning
it
was
your
doings
and
the
way
you
was
waiting
for
his
kiss
was
more
a
mother
way
i
have
had
some
hard
moments
with
myself
miss
sheila
and
i
have
come
to
this
that
i
have
got
to
write
and
tell
you
how
i
feel
and
ask
your
forgiveness
you
see
you
were
something
in
my
life
different
from
anything
that
had
ever
been
there
i
rightly
know
i
likely
never
will
know
what
you
meant
in
my
life
i
handled
you
in
my
heart
like
a
flower
before
god
i
had
a
religion
for
you
and
that
was
just
why
when
i
thought
you
was
bad
that
it
drove
me
crazy
i
wonder
if
you
will
understand
this
you
are
awful
young
and
awful
ignorant
and
i
have
hurt
your
pride
you
are
terrible
proud
for
your
years
miss
sheila
i
ache
all
over
when
i
think
that
i
hurt
your
pretty
mouth
i
hope
it
is
smiling
now
i
am
moving
out
of
millings
me
and
momma
and
babe
but
girlie
is
agoing
to
marry
jim
he
run
right
back
to
her
like
a
little
lost
lamb
the
second
you
was
gone
likely
never
touch
liquor
again
i
have
heard
from
dickie
i
guess
he
gone
where
the
saloons
are
bigger
and
where
you
can
get
oysters
with
your
drinks
he
always
was
a
damn
fool
i
would
dearly
like
to
go
over
to
hidden
creek
and
see
you
but
i
feel
like
i
better
not
it
would
hurt
me
if
i
got
a
from
you
like
it
will
hurt
me
if
you
answer
this
letter
which
is
a
mighty
poor
attempt
to
tell
you
my
bad
reasons
for
behaving
like
i
did
i
am
not
sorry
i
thrashed
dickie
he
had
ought
to
be
thrashed
good
and
plenty
and
he
has
sure
paid
me
off
by
burning
down
my
aura
that
was
a
saloon
in
a
million
miss
sheila
and
the
picture
of
you
standing
there
back
of
my
bar
looking
so
dainty
and
sweet
and
fine
in
your
black
dress
and
your
frills
well
sure
try
to
be
thinking
of
that
when
i
cash
in
well
miss
sheila
i
wish
you
good
fortune
in
whatever
you
do
and
i
hope
that
if
you
ever
need
a
friend
you
will
overlook
my
bad
break
and
remember
the
artist
that
tried
to
put
you
in
his
big
work
and
failed
this
extraordinary
document
was
signed
sylvester
sheila
was
left
bewildered
with
strange
tears
in
her
throat
chapter
vii
sanctuary
there
came
to
the
restaurant
where
dickie
worked
a
certain
sallow
and
irritable
man
no
longer
in
his
early
youth
he
came
daily
for
one
of
his
three
meals
it
might
be
lunch
or
dinner
or
even
breakfast
dickie
was
always
in
haste
to
serve
him
for
some
reason
the
man
clever
and
nervous
personality
intrigued
his
interest
and
this
although
his
customer
never
threw
him
a
glance
scowled
at
a
newspaper
barked
out
an
order
gulped
his
food
stuck
a
tip
under
the
edge
of
his
plate
and
jerked
himself
away
on
a
certain
sluggish
noon
hour
in
august
dickie
as
far
as
the
kitchen
door
with
a
tray
balanced
on
his
palm
realized
that
he
had
forgotten
this
man
order
he
hesitated
to
go
back
like
as
not
reasoned
dickie
he
did
rightly
know
what
the
order
was
he
never
does
look
at
his
food
i
fetch
him
a
spanish
omelette
and
a
salad
and
a
glass
of
iced
tea
it
a
whole
lot
better
order
than
he
have
thought
of
himself
nevertheless
it
was
with
some
trepidation
that
he
set
the
omelette
down
before
that
lined
and
averted
countenance
its
owner
was
screwed
into
his
chair
as
usual
eyes
with
a
sharp
cleft
between
their
brows
bent
on
his
folded
newspaper
and
he
put
his
right
hand
blindly
on
the
fork
but
as
it
pricked
the
contents
of
the
plate
a
savory
fragrance
rose
and
the
reader
looked
here
you
damn
fool
that
not
my
order
he
snapped
out
dickie
tasted
a
homely
memory
dickie
damn
fool
he
stood
silent
a
moment
looking
down
with
one
of
his
quaint
impersonal
looks
well
sir
then
he
said
slowly
it
ai
your
order
but
you
look
a
whole
lot
more
like
a
feller
that
would
order
spanish
omelette
than
like
a
feller
that
would
order
hamburger
steak
for
the
first
time
the
man
turned
about
flung
his
arm
over
his
and
looked
up
at
dickie
in
fact
he
stared
his
thin
lips
enclosed
in
an
parenthesis
of
double
lines
twisted
themselves
slightly
i
be
derned
he
said
but
look
here
my
man
i
did
order
hamburger
steak
i
ordered
chicken
dickie
deliberately
smoothed
down
the
cowlick
on
his
head
he
wore
his
look
of
a
with
which
he
was
wont
to
face
the
extremity
of
sylvester
exasperation
i
reckon
i
clean
forgot
your
order
sir
he
said
i
figured
out
that
you
would
be
caring
what
was
on
your
plate
this
heat
he
added
sure
puts
a
blinder
on
a
feller
memory
the
man
laughed
shortly
it
all
right
he
said
this
go
down
he
ate
in
silence
then
he
glanced
up
again
what
are
you
waiting
for
anyway
dickie
flushed
faintly
i
was
sort
of
wishful
to
see
how
it
would
go
down
oh
i
do
mean
that
kind
of
waiting
i
mean
why
are
you
a
waiter
in
this
dickie
meditated
there
ai
no
answer
to
that
he
said
i
do
know
why
he
added
why
anything
it
a
sort
of
extry
word
in
the
dictionary
do
mean
much
any
way
you
look
at
it
he
gathered
up
the
dishes
the
man
watched
him
tilting
back
a
little
in
his
chair
his
eyes
twinkling
under
brows
drawn
together
a
moment
afterwards
he
left
the
restaurant
it
was
a
few
nights
later
when
dickie
saw
him
again
or
rather
when
dickie
was
again
seen
by
him
this
time
dickie
was
not
in
the
restaurant
he
was
at
a
table
in
a
small
free
library
near
greenwich
avenue
and
he
was
copying
painstakingly
with
one
hand
from
a
fat
volume
which
he
held
down
with
the
other
the
strong
light
made
a
circle
of
brilliance
about
him
his
fair
hair
shone
silvery
bright
his
face
had
a
sort
of
seraphic
pallor
the
orderer
of
chicken
striding
away
from
the
desk
with
a
hastily
obtained
book
of
reference
stopped
short
and
stared
at
him
then
came
close
and
touched
the
thin
shiny
shoulder
of
the
blue
serge
coat
this
the
way
you
take
your
pleasure
he
asked
abruptly
dickie
looked
up
slowly
and
his
consciousness
seemed
to
travel
even
more
slowly
back
from
the
fairy
doings
of
a
midsummer
night
under
the
observant
eyes
bent
upon
it
his
face
changed
extraordinarily
from
the
face
of
untroubled
almost
immortal
childhood
to
the
face
of
struggling
and
reserved
manhood
hullo
he
said
with
a
smile
of
recognition
well
yes
not
always
what
are
you
reading
the
man
slipped
into
the
chair
beside
dickie
put
on
his
glasses
and
looked
at
the
fat
book
poetry
hmp
what
are
you
copying
it
for
letter
to
your
girl
dickie
had
all
the
westerner
prejudice
against
questions
but
he
felt
drawn
to
this
patron
of
the
so
though
he
drawled
his
answer
slightly
it
was
an
honest
answer
it
ai
my
book
he
said
that
why
i
copying
it
why
in
thunder
do
you
take
it
out
you
young
idiot
dickie
colored
well
sir
i
do
rightly
understand
the
workings
of
this
place
i
come
by
it
on
the
way
home
and
i
kep
folks
in
with
books
and
comin
out
with
books
i
figured
it
was
a
kind
of
exchange
proposition
i
only
got
one
book
and
that
ai
rightly
mine
the
man
looking
at
him
wondered
why
his
face
flamed
so
when
i
came
in
i
just
watched
and
i
figured
you
could
read
here
if
you
had
the
notion
to
take
down
a
book
and
fetch
it
over
to
the
table
and
copy
from
it
and
return
it
so
i
been
doin
that
why
did
you
go
to
the
desk
youngster
and
ask
questions
where
i
come
from
dickie
was
drawling
again
folks
do
deal
so
much
in
questions
as
they
do
here
where
you
came
from
you
came
from
mars
come
along
to
the
desk
and
i
fix
you
up
with
a
card
and
you
can
take
an
armful
of
poetry
home
with
you
dickie
went
to
the
desk
and
signed
his
name
the
stranger
signed
his
augustus
lorrimer
the
librarian
stamped
a
bit
of
cardboard
and
stuck
it
into
the
fat
volume
she
handed
it
to
dickie
wearily
thank
he
said
with
such
respectful
fervor
that
she
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
now
where
your
diggings
asked
lorrimer
who
had
taken
no
hints
about
asking
questions
east
or
west
he
was
a
newspaper
reporter
would
you
be
carin
to
walk
home
with
me
asked
dickie
there
was
a
great
deal
of
dignity
in
his
tone
more
in
his
carriage
yes
i
be
caring
to
lead
on
martian
and
lorrimer
felt
after
he
said
that
that
he
was
a
vulgarian
a
sensation
in
mars
he
commented
to
himself
this
young
man
was
some
kind
of
a
prince
what
do
you
look
over
your
shoulder
that
way
for
dick
he
asked
aloud
a
few
blocks
on
their
way
scared
the
police
will
take
away
your
book
dickie
blinked
at
him
with
a
startled
air
did
i
i
reckon
a
feller
gets
into
queer
ways
when
he
alone
a
whole
lot
i
get
kind
of
like
somebody
was
following
me
in
this
town
so
many
folks
goin
to
and
fro
does
it
to
me
most
likely
yes
a
fellow
does
get
into
queer
ways
when
he
alone
a
whole
lot
said
lorrimer
slowly
his
mind
went
back
a
dozen
years
to
his
own
first
winter
in
new
york
he
looked
with
keenness
at
dickie
face
it
was
a
curiously
charming
face
he
thought
but
it
was
with
a
harried
struggling
sort
of
look
and
this
in
spite
of
its
quaint
detachment
know
any
one
in
this
city
no
sir
not
rightly
i
made
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
waiters
they
asked
me
to
join
a
club
but
i
have
got
the
cash
what
pay
do
you
draw
dickie
named
a
sum
not
much
eh
but
you
got
your
tips
yes
sir
i
pay
my
board
with
my
pay
and
live
on
the
tips
must
be
uncertain
kind
of
living
where
do
you
live
anyway
what
here
they
had
crossed
washington
square
and
were
entering
a
tall
studio
building
to
the
south
and
east
dickie
climbed
lightly
up
the
stairs
lorrimer
followed
with
a
feeling
of
bewilderment
on
the
top
landing
dimly
lighted
dickie
unlocked
a
door
and
stood
aside
just
step
in
and
look
up
he
said
afore
i
light
the
light
see
something
lorrimer
obeyed
a
swarm
of
golden
bees
glimmered
before
his
eyes
stars
said
dickie
down
below
you
would
hardly
know
you
had
would
you
lorrimer
did
not
answer
a
moment
later
an
asthmatic
caught
its
breath
and
he
saw
a
bare
studio
room
almost
vacant
of
furniture
there
was
a
bed
and
a
screen
and
a
few
chairs
one
window
facing
an
alley
wall
the
stars
had
vanished
pretty
palatial
quarters
for
a
fellow
on
your
job
lorrimer
remarked
how
did
you
happen
to
get
here
some
people
i
knowed
of
once
lived
here
dickie
voice
had
taken
on
a
certain
remoteness
and
even
lorrimer
knew
that
here
questions
stopped
he
accepted
a
chair
declined
the
makings
proffered
a
cigarette
during
these
amenities
his
eyes
flew
about
the
room
good
lord
he
ejaculated
is
all
that
stuff
your
copying
there
was
a
pile
of
loose
and
scattered
manuscript
upon
the
table
under
the
yes
sir
dickie
smiled
i
was
plumb
foolish
to
go
to
all
that
labor
lorrimer
drew
near
to
the
table
and
coolly
looked
over
the
papers
dickie
watched
him
with
rather
a
startled
air
and
a
flush
that
might
have
seemed
one
of
resentment
if
his
eyes
had
not
worn
their
impersonal
observing
look
all
poetry
muttered
lorrimer
but
some
of
it
only
a
line
or
a
word
he
read
aloud
to
the
sun
in
lonely
lands
what
that
from
anyway
a
poem
about
an
eagle
by
a
man
named
alfred
tennyson
ai
it
the
way
a
feller
feels
though
up
on
the
top
of
a
rocky
peak
never
been
on
the
top
of
a
rocky
peak
kind
of
a
sensation
is
it
what
all
this
i
have
been
faithful
to
thee
cynara
after
my
fashion
dickie
face
again
flamed
in
spite
of
himself
it
a
love
poem
the
feller
could
forget
he
could
keep
himself
from
loving
because
he
loved
so
much
the
other
way
well
sir
you
better
read
it
for
yourself
it
a
mighty
real
sort
of
a
poem
if
you
were
that
sort
of
a
feller
i
mean
and
this
is
ballad
of
reading
gaol
and
here
a
sonnet
was
not
like
your
great
and
gracious
ways
coventry
patmore
well
young
man
you
a
catholic
taste
i
do
rightly
belong
to
any
church
said
dickie
gravely
my
mother
is
a
methodist
lorrimer
moved
abruptly
away
and
moved
abruptly
back
where
were
you
educated
dick
i
was
raised
in
millings
dickie
named
the
western
state
i
get
only
to
grammar
school
my
father
needed
me
to
work
in
his
hotel
too
bad
sighed
lorrimer
well
i
bid
you
and
many
thanks
you
got
a
fine
place
here
again
he
sighed
i
dare
say
one
of
these
days
he
was
absent
and
irritable
again
dickie
accompanied
him
down
the
three
long
narrow
flights
and
climbed
back
to
his
loneliness
he
was
however
very
much
excited
by
his
adventure
excited
and
disturbed
he
felt
restless
he
walked
about
and
whistled
to
himself
until
now
he
had
had
but
one
companion
the
thought
of
sheila
it
was
extraordinary
how
immediate
she
was
during
the
first
dreadful
weeks
of
his
drudgery
in
the
stifling
confusions
of
the
restaurant
when
even
the
memory
of
sylvester
faded
under
the
acute
reality
of
the
head
waiter
sarcasms
that
love
of
his
for
sheila
had
fled
away
and
left
him
dull
and
leaden
and
empty
of
his
soul
and
his
tiny
bedroom
had
seemed
like
a
coffin
when
he
laid
himself
down
in
it
and
tried
to
remember
her
it
had
come
to
him
like
a
mountain
wind
overwhelmingly
irresistibly
the
desire
to
live
where
she
lived
the
first
wish
he
had
had
since
he
had
learned
that
she
was
not
to
be
found
by
him
and
the
miracle
had
accomplished
itself
halligan
had
been
instructed
to
get
a
lodger
at
almost
any
price
for
the
studio
room
she
lowered
the
rent
to
the
exact
limit
of
dickie
wages
she
had
never
bargained
with
so
a
applicant
for
lodgings
and
that
night
he
lay
awake
under
sheila
stars
from
then
on
he
lived
always
in
her
presence
and
here
in
the
room
that
had
known
her
he
kept
himself
fastidious
and
clean
he
shut
out
the
of
his
shrewd
desires
the
room
was
sanctuary
it
was
to
rescue
sheila
rather
than
himself
that
dickie
fled
up
to
the
stars
so
deeply
so
intimately
had
she
become
a
part
of
him
that
he
seemed
to
carry
her
soul
in
his
hands
so
had
the
young
dreamer
wedded
his
dream
he
lived
with
sheila
as
truly
as
loyally
as
though
he
knew
that
she
would
welcome
him
with
one
of
those
downward
rushes
or
give
him
godspeed
on
sultry
feverish
dawns
with
a
cool
kiss
dickie
lay
sometimes
across
his
bed
and
drew
her
cheek
in
trembling
fancy
close
to
his
until
the
anguish
wet
his
pillow
with
mute
tears
now
to
this
dual
loneliness
lorrimer
had
climbed
and
dickie
felt
rather
gratefully
that
life
had
reached
up
to
the
aching
unrealities
of
his
existence
his
tight
and
painful
life
had
opened
like
the
first
fold
of
a
fan
he
built
upon
the
promise
of
a
friendship
with
this
questioning
impertinent
mocking
keenly
sympathetic
visitor
but
a
fortnight
passed
without
lorrimer
appearing
at
the
restaurant
and
when
at
last
he
did
come
dickie
flying
to
his
chair
was
greeted
by
a
cold
unsmiling
word
and
a
businesslike
quotation
from
the
menu
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
struck
his
face
burned
in
the
west
a
fellow
could
do
that
and
get
away
with
it
he
tightened
an
impotent
thin
fist
he
filled
the
order
and
kept
his
distance
and
absurdly
enough
gave
lorrimer
tip
to
another
waiter
and
went
without
his
own
dinner
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
a
sense
of
social
inferiority
of
humiliation
concerning
the
nature
of
his
work
came
to
him
he
felt
the
pang
of
servitude
a
pang
unknown
to
the
inhabitants
of
frontier
towns
when
sheila
washed
dishes
for
hudson
she
was
the
young
lady
from
noo
york
who
helps
round
at
hudson
house
dickie
fought
this
shame
sturdily
but
it
seemed
to
cling
to
have
a
sticky
pervasiveness
try
as
he
might
he
could
brush
it
off
his
mind
nevertheless
it
was
on
the
very
heels
of
this
embittering
experience
that
life
plucked
him
up
from
his
slough
one
of
the
leveling
public
catastrophes
came
to
aid
not
that
he
knew
he
was
a
dumb
prayer
for
aid
he
knew
only
that
every
day
was
harder
to
face
than
the
last
that
every
night
the
stars
up
there
through
sheila
skylight
seemed
to
glimmer
more
dully
with
less
inspiration
on
his
fagged
spirit
the
sluggish
monotony
of
the
restaurant
existence
was
stirred
that
september
night
by
a
big
neighboring
fire
waiters
and
guests
tumbled
out
to
the
call
of
and
running
feet
dickie
found
himself
beside
lorrimer
who
caught
him
by
the
elbow
keep
by
me
kid
he
said
and
there
was
something
in
his
tone
that
softened
injury
if
you
want
a
good
i
can
get
through
the
ropes
he
showed
his
card
to
a
policeman
pulled
dickie
after
him
and
they
found
themselves
in
an
inner
circle
of
the
inferno
before
them
a
tall
hideous
warehouse
broke
forth
into
a
horrible
beauty
it
was
as
though
a
tortured
soul
had
burst
bars
it
roared
and
glowed
and
sent
up
petals
of
smoky
rose
and
seeds
of
fire
against
the
sky
the
crowds
pressed
against
the
ropes
and
turned
up
their
faces
to
drink
in
the
terror
of
the
spectacle
lorrimer
had
out
his
notebook
damn
fires
he
said
they
bore
me
does
all
this
look
like
anything
to
you
that
fire
and
those
people
and
their
silly
faces
all
tilted
up
and
turned
red
and
blue
and
purple
he
was
talking
to
himself
and
so
really
was
dickie
when
he
made
his
own
statement
in
a
queer
tone
of
frightened
awe
they
look
like
a
flower
garden
in
hell
he
whispered
lorrimer
threw
up
his
chin
say
that
again
will
you
he
snapped
out
go
on
do
stop
tell
me
everything
that
comes
into
your
damn
young
head
of
a
wandering
martian
fly
at
it
i
take
you
down
you
mean
said
dickie
tell
you
what
i
think
this
looks
like
that
what
i
mean
do
dickie
smiled
a
queer
sort
of
smile
he
had
found
a
listener
at
last
a
moment
later
lorrimer
pencil
was
in
rapid
motion
and
the
eyes
shot
little
stabbing
looks
at
dickie
unselfconscious
face
when
it
was
over
he
snapped
an
elastic
round
his
notebook
returned
it
to
his
pocket
and
laid
his
hand
on
dickie
thin
tense
arm
come
along
with
me
dick
said
lorrimer

fighting

he
added
solemnly
but
god
gave
me
the
sense
to
know
the
real
thing
when
i
see
it
i
been
fighting
you
calling
myself

fool

white
apron
and
then

you

sky
parlor

said
dickie
faintly
it
was
a
prayer
for
some
enlightenment
chapter

desertion
hilliard
rode
up
along
hidden
creek
on
a
frosty
october
morning
everywhere
now
the
aspens
were
torches
of
gold
the
cottonwood
trees
smoky
and
gaunt
the
ground
bright
with
fallen
leaves
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
has
swept
his
heart
clean
of
devils
his
face
was
keen
with
his
desire
he
sang
as
he
rode
sweetly
an
old
sentimental
spanish
song
something
his
mother
had
taught
him
but
it
was
not
of
his
mother
he
thought
or
only
perhaps
deep
down
in
his
subconsciousness
of
that
early
and
most
mysterious
which
now
he
had
translated
and
transferred
sweet
sweet
is
the
jasmine
flower
let
its
stars
guide
thee
sweet
is
the
heart
of
a
rose
sweet
is
the
thought
of
thee
deep
in
my
heart
the
dogs
were
off
coursing
the
woods
that
afternoon
and
the
little
clearing
lay
as
still
as
a
green
lake
under
the
threatening
crest
of
the
mountain
cosme
slipped
from
his
horse
pulled
the
reins
over
his
head
and
left
him
to
graze
at
will
miss
blake
opened
the
door
at
his
knock
she
greeted
him
with
a
sardonic
smile
i
do
know
whether
you
see
your
girl
or
not
she
said
give
her
time
to
get
over
her
tantrums
cosme
turned
a
lightning
look
upon
her
tantrums
sheila
oh
my
friend
she
has
a
devil
of
her
own
that
little
make
yourself
comfortable
miss
blake
pointed
him
to
a
chair
i
tell
her
you
here
she
went
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
which
rose
from
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
called
heartily
an
indulgent
laugh
in
her
voice
you
sheila
better
come
down
here
your
beau
there
was
no
answer
hear
me
sheila
this
time
some
brief
and
muffled
answer
was
returned
miss
blake
smiled
and
went
over
to
her
throne
there
she
sat
and
sewed
an
incongruous
occupation
it
looked
cosme
was
leaning
forward
elbows
on
knees
his
face
a
study
of
impatience
anger
and
suspicion
what
made
her
mad
he
asked
bluntly
she
get
over
it
she
be
down
sheila
ca
resist
a
young
man
you
see
what
did
you
do
insisted
the
stern
crisp
voice
when
cosme
was
angry
he
reverted
rapidly
to
type
why
drawled
miss
blake
i
crept
up
when
she
was
drying
her
hair
and
i
cut
it
off
she
laughed
loudly
at
his
fierce
start
cut
off
her
hair
what
right
no
right
at
all
my
friend
but
common
sense
what
the
good
of
all
that
fluffy
stuff
hanging
about
and
taking
hours
of
her
time
to
brush
and
wash
and
besides
she
shot
a
look
at
him
it
part
of
the
cure
by
the
lord
said
cosme
i
like
you
to
explain
the
woman
crossed
her
legs
calmly
she
was
still
indulgently
amused
do
lose
your
head
young
man
she
advised
better
smoke
after
an
instant
cosme
rolled
and
lighted
a
cigarette
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
anger
had
settled
to
a
sort
of
patient
contempt
i
put
her
into
breeches
too
said
miss
blake
what
the
devil
what
do
you
mean
she
has
a
will
of
her
own
has
she
oh
yes
but
you
see
i
got
miss
sheila
just
about
where
i
want
her
she
grateful
enough
for
her
food
and
the
roof
over
her
head
and
for
the
chance
i
giving
her
chance
he
laughed
shortly
chance
to
do
all
your
heavy
work
why
not
say
work
it
something
new
to
her
there
was
a
brief
thunderous
silence
cosme
cigarette
burned
between
his
stiff
fingers
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
hoarse
with
the
effort
of
his
she
looked
at
him
sharply
now
are
you
paul
carey
hilliard
son
the
son
of
roxana
hilliard
she
asked
she
pointed
a
finger
at
him
yes
he
answered
with
thin
lips
his
eyes
narrowed
his
face
was
all
latin
all
cruel
well
miss
blake
slid
her
hands
reflectively
back
and
forth
on
the
bone
arms
of
her
chair
she
had
put
down
her
work
i
was
just
thinking
she
said
slowly
and
kindly
that
the
son
of
your
mother
would
be
rather
extra
careful
in
choosing
the
mother
of
his
sons
i
shall
be
very
careful
he
answered
between
the
thin
lips
i
being
careful
she
fell
back
with
an
air
of
relief
oh
she
said
as
though
illuminated
i
understand
then
it
all
right
i
did
read
your
game
his
face
caught
fire
at
her
apparent
misunderstanding
i
do
read
yours
he
said
game
bless
you
i
no
game
to
play
i
giving
sheila
her
chance
but
i
not
going
to
give
her
a
chance
at
the
cost
of
your
happiness
too
good
a
lad
for
that
i
thought
you
were
going
to
ask
her
to
be
your
wife
and
i
was
going
to
allow
you
to
do
it
blind
i
was
going
to
advise
you
to
come
back
three
years
from
now
and
see
her
again
maybe
this
fine
clean
air
and
this
life
and
this
honest
work
and
the
training
she
gets
from
me
will
make
her
straight

muttered

burnt
itself

shortly

anything
for
her
she
was
real
set
on
being
a
good
girl
when
she
quit
hudson
i
do
but
i
willing
to
bet
that
she
turn
you
down
from
far
away
up
the
came
the
fierce
baying
of
the
dog
pack
cosme
pulled
himself
together
and
stood
up
his
face
had
an
ignorant
baffled
look
the
look
of
an
unskilled
and
simple
mind
caught
in
a
web
i
reckon
she
she
is
coming
down
he
said
slowly
without
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
floor
i
reckon
i
be
going
i
wo
wait
he
walked
to
the
door
his
steps
falling
without
spring
and
went
out
and
so
across
the
porch
and
the
clearing
to
his
horse
at
the
sound
of
the
closing
door
there
came
a
flurry
of
movement
in
the
loft
the
trap
was
raised
sheila
came
quickly
down
the
ladder
she
was
dressed
in
a
pair
of
and
her
hair
was
cropped
like
miss
blake
just
below
the
ears
the
quaintest
of
a
rosalind
she
looked
just
a
wisp
of
grace
utterly
unlike
a
boy
all
the
soft
slim
litheness
with
its
quick
turns
revealed
a
little
figure
of
unconscious
sweet
enchantment
but
the
face
was
flushed
and
the
eyes
distressed
she
stood
hands
on
her
belt
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
why
has
he
gone
why
did
he
wait
miss
blake
turned
a
frank
indulgent
face
but
it
was
deeply
flushed
oh
shucks
she
said
i
suppose
he
got
tired
why
you
come
down
sheila
sent
a
look
down
her
slim
legs
oh
because
i
a
fool
miss
blake
did
you
burn
my
two
frocks
both
of
them
her
eyes
coaxed
and
filled
it
all
they
fit
for
my
dear
you
can
make
yourself
new
ones
you
know
it
more
sensible
and
comfortable
too
to
work
and
ride
in
breeches
i
know
what
i
doing
i
lived
this
way
quite
a
number
of
years
you
look
real
nice
i
ca
abide
female
floppery
anyhow
what
it
a
sign
of
rotten
slavery
she
set
her
very
even
teeth
together
hard
as
she
said
this
but
sheila
was
neither
looking
nor
listening
she
had
heard
hoofs
her
cheeks
flamed
she
ran
to
the
door
she
stood
on
the
porch
and
called
cosme
hilliard
come
back
there
was
no
answer
a
few
minutes
later
she
came
in
pale
and
puzzled
he
did
even
wave
she
said
he
turned
back
in
his
saddle
and
stared
at
me
he
rode
away
staring
at
me
miss
blake
what
did
you
say
to
him
you
were
talking
a
long
time
we
were
talking
said
miss
blake
about
dogs
and
how
to
raise
and
then
he
up
and
said
goodbye
oh
sheila
it
all
right
he
be
back
when
he
got
over
being
miffed
why
he
expected
you
to
come
down
the
ladder
head
over
heels
to
see
him
a
handsome
fellow
like
that
shucks
have
you
ever
dealt
with
the
vanity
of
a
young
male
before
it
as
jumpy
as
a
rabbit
get
to
work
and
as
though
to
justify
miss
blake
prophecy
just
ten
days
later
hilliard
did
come
again
it
was
a
sunday
and
sheila
had
packed
her
lunch
and
gone
off
on
nigger
baby
for
the
day
the
ostensible
object
of
her
ride
was
a
visit
to
the
source
of
hidden
creek
really
she
was
climbing
away
from
a
hurt
she
felt
hilliard
wordless
departure
and
prolonged
absence
keenly
she
had
not
to
put
it
euphemistically
many
friends
her
remedy
was
successful
impossible
on
such
a
ride
to
cherish
minor
or
major
pangs
she
rode
into
the
smoky
dimness
of
where
the
sunlight
burned
in
flecks
and
out
again
across
the
little
open
mountain
meadows
jeweled
with
white
and
gold
blue
and
flowers
a
window
scattered
across
the
ground
from
these
glades
she
could
see
the
forest
an
army
of
tall
pilgrims
very
grave
going
up
with
long
staves
in
their
hands
to
worship
at
a
high
shrine
the
rocks
above
were
very
grave
too
and
grim
and
still
against
the
even
blue
sky
across
their
purplish
gray
a
waterfall
streaked
down
struck
crystal
by
the
sun
an
eagle
turned
in
great
swinging
circles
sheila
had
an
exquisite
lifting
of
heart
a
sense
of
entire
fusion
body
blessed
by
spirit
spirit
blessed
by
body
she
felt
a
distinct
pleasure
in
the
flapping
of
her
short
hair
against
her
neck
at
the
pony
motion
between
her
unhampered
legs
at
the
moist
warmth
of
his
neck
under
her
hand
and
this
physical
pleasure
seemed
akin
to
the
ecstasy
of
prayer
she
came
at
last
to
a
difficult
narrow
cañon
trail
where
the
pony
hopped
skillfully
over
fallen
trees
until
for
very
weariness
of
his
choppy
determined
efforts
she
dismounted
tied
him
securely
and
made
the
rest
of
her
climb
on
foot
hidden
creek
tumbled
near
her
and
its
voice
swelled
all
at
once
round
the
corner
of
a
great
wall
of
rock
she
came
upon
the
head
it
gushed
out
of
the
in
a
tumult
of
life
not
in
a
single
stream
but
in
many
frothy
writhing
of
foam
she
sat
for
an
hour
and
watched
this
mysterious
birth
from
the
watched
till
the
pretty
confusion
of
the
water
with
its
voices
had
dizzied
and
dazed
her
to
the
point
of
complete
forgetfulness
of
self
she
had
entered
into
a
sort
of
a
trance
a
nirvana
she
shook
herself
out
of
it
ate
her
lunch
and
scrambled
quickly
back
to
nigger
baby
it
was
late
afternoon
when
she
crossed
the
mountain
glades
their
look
had
mysteriously
changed
there
was
something
almost
uncanny
now
about
their
brilliance
in
the
sunset
light
and
when
she
rode
into
the
streaked
darkness
of
the
woods
they
were
full
of
ghostly
unintelligible
sounds
to
rest
her
muscles
she
was
riding
with
her
right
leg
thrown
over
the
horn
as
though
on
a
side
saddle
a
great
mass
of
flowers
was
tied
in
front
of
her
she
had
opened
her
shirt
at
the
neck
and
her
head
was
bare
she
was
singing
to
keep
up
her
heart
then
suddenly
she
had
no
more
need
of
singing
she
saw
cosme
walking
toward
her
up
the
trail
his
face
lacked
all
its
vivid
color
it
was
rather
haggard
and
stern
the
devils
he
had
swept
out
of
his
heart
a
fortnight
earlier
had
since
then
been
violently
entertained
he
stepped
out
of
the
path
and
waited
for
her
his
hands
on
his
hips
but
as
she
rode
down
she
saw
this
look
melt
the
blood
crept
up
to
his
cheeks
the
light
to
his
eyes
it
was
like
a
rock
taking
the
sun
she
had
smiled
at
him
with
all
the
usual
exquisite
grace
and
simplicity
when
she
came
beside
him
she
drew
rein
and
at
the
same
instant
he
put
his
hand
on
the
pony
bridle
he
looked
up
at
her
dumbly
and
for
some
reason
she
too
found
it
impossible
to
speak
she
could
see
that
he
was
breathing
fast
through
parted
lips
and
that
the
lips
were
both
cruel
and
sensitive
his
hand
slid
back
along
nigger
baby
neck
paused
and
rested
on
her
knee
then
suddenly
he
came
a
big
step
closer
threw
both
his
arms
tightening
with
a
strength
about
her
and
hid
his
face
against
her
knees
sheila
he
said
thickly
he
looked
up
with
a
sort
of
anguish
into
her
face
sheila
if
you
are
not
fit
to
be
the
mother
of
my
children
you
are
fit
for
any
man
to
love
her
soft
slim
body
hardened
against
him
even
before
her
face
they
stared
at
each
other
for
a
minute
let
me
get
down
said
sheila
he
stepped
back
not
quite
understanding
she
dropped
off
the
horse
dragging
her
flowers
with
her
and
faced
him
she
did
not
feel
small
or
slender
she
felt
as
high
as
a
hill
although
she
had
to
look
up
at
him
so
far
her
anger
had
its
head
against
the
sky
why
do
you
talk
about
a
man
love
she
asked
him
with
a
queer
sort
of
patience
i
think
i
hope
that
you
do
know
anything
about
a
man
love
oh
the
men
love
she
thought
with
swift
pain
of
jim
of
sylvester
oh
the
they
love
and
she
found
that
under
her
breath
she
was
sobbing
dickie
dickie
as
though
her
heart
had
called
will
you
take
back
your
horse
please
she
said
choking
over
these
sobs
which
hurt
her
more
at
the
moment
than
he
had
hurt
her
i
never
ride
on
him
again
do
come
back
here
do
try
to
see
me
any
more
i
suppose
it
it
the
way
you
love
me
is
because
i
was
a
barmaid
because
you
heard
people
speak
of
me
as
queen
she
conquered
one
of
the
sobs
i
thought
that
after
you
looked
into
my
face
so
hard
that
night
and
stopped
yourself
from
from
my
lips
that
you
had
understood
she
shook
her
head
from
side
to
side
so
violently
so
childishly
that
the
short
hair
lashed
across
her
eyes
no
one
ever
will
understand
she
ran
away
from
him
and
cried
under
her
breath
dickie
dickie
she
ran
straight
into
the
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
her
arms
were
full
of
the
flowers
she
had
pulled
down
from
nigger
baby
neck
what
did
you
want
to
bring
in
all
that
truck
miss
blake
began
rising
from
the
pianola
then
stopped
what
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
did
your
young
man
find
you
i
sent
him
up
the
trail
her
red
eyes
sparkled
he
insulted
me
gasped
sheila
he
dared
to
insult
me
she
was
dramatic
with
her
helpless
young
rage
he
said
i
was
fit
to
to
be
the
mother
of
his
children
and
she
laughed
angrily
handling
behind
cosme
back
the
weapon
that
she
had
been
too
merciful
to
use
and
mother
is
a
murderess
found
guilty
of
murder
and
of
worse
a
sort
of
ripple
of
sound
behind
made
her
turn
cosme
had
followed
her
was
standing
in
the
open
door
and
had
heard
her
speech
the
weapon
had
struck
home
and
she
saw
how
it
had
poisoned
all
his
blood
he
vanished
without
a
word
sheila
turned
back
to
miss
blake
a
paler
face
she
let
fall
all
her
flowers
now
he
never
come
back
she
said
she
climbed
up
the
ladder
to
her
loft
there
she
sat
for
an
hour
listening
to
the
silence
her
mind
busied
itself
with
trivial
memories
she
thought
of
amelia
plecks
it
would
have
comforted
her
to
hear
that
knock
and
the
rattle
of
her
dinner
tray
the
little
at
hudson
hotel
with
its
bit
of
tapestry
and
its
yellow
and
its
vases
filled
with
flowers
seemed
to
her
memory
as
elaborate
and
artificial
as
the
boudoir
of
a
french
princess
farther
than
millings
had
seemed
from
her
old
life
did
this
dark
little
gabled
attic
seem
from
millings
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
this
strange
wandering
this
withdrawing
of
herself
farther
and
farther
into
the
lonely
places
she
longed
for
the
noise
of
babe
hearty
irrepressible
voice
with
its
smack
of
chewing
of
her
step
coming
up
the
stairs
to
that
little
bedroom
under
hudson
gaudy
roof
could
it
be
possible
that
she
was
homesick
for
millings
for
the
bar
with
its
lights
and
its
visitors
and
its
guardian
her
lids
were
actually
smarting
with
tears
at
the
recollection
of
carthy
big
irish
face
he
had
been
such
a
good
faithful
were
men
always
like
that
either
or
wolves
the
simile
brought
her
back
to
hidden
creek
it
grew
darker
and
darker
a
heavy
darkness
the
night
had
a
new
soft
weight
there
began
to
be
a
sort
of
whisper
in
the
stillness
not
the
motion
of
pines
for
there
was
no
wind
perhaps
it
was
more
a
sensation
than
a
sound
of
innumerable
soft
numb
fingers
working
against
the
silence
sheila
got
up
shivering
lighted
her
candle
and
went
over
to
the
small
window
under
the
eaves
she
pressed
her
face
against
it
and
started
back
things
were
flying
toward
her
she
opened
the
sash
and
a
whirling
scarf
of
stars
flung
itself
into
the
room
it
was
snowing
the
night
was
blind
with
snow
chapter
ix
work
and
a
song
on
the
studio
skylight
the
misty
autumn
rain
fell
that
night
as
the
snow
fell
against
sheila
with
a
light
tapping
below
it
dickie
worked
he
had
very
little
leisure
now
for
stars
or
dreams
for
the
first
time
in
his
neglected
and
mismanaged
life
he
knew
the
pleasure
of
congenial
work
and
this
although
lorrimer
worked
him
like
a
slave
he
dragged
him
over
the
city
and
set
his
faculty
to
labor
in
dark
corners
dickie
every
sense
keen
and
clean
was
not
allowed
to
flinch
no
his
freshness
was
his
value
and
the
power
that
was
in
him
driven
with
whip
and
spur
throve
and
grew
and
fairly
took
the
bit
in
its
teeth
and
ran
away
with
its
trainer
look
here
my
lad
lorrimer
had
said
that
morning
you
keep
on
laying
hands
on
the
english
language
the
way
you
been
doing
lately
and
have
to
get
a
job
for
you
on
the
staff
then
my
plagiarism
that
has
been
paying
us
both
so
well
comes
to
an
end
i
wo
have
the
face
to
edit
stuff
like
this
much
longer
lorrimer
did
not
realize
in
his
amazement
that
dickie
mind
had
always
busied
itself
with
this
exciting
and
matter
of
choosing
words
from
his
childhood
in
the
face
of
ridicule
and
outrage
he
had
fumbled
with
the
tools
of
trade
no
wonder
that
now
knowledge
and
practice
and
the
sort
of
intensive
training
he
was
under
magically
fitted
all
the
jumbled
odds
and
ends
into
place
dickie
had
stopped
looking
over
his
shoulder
the
pursuing
pack
the
beasts
of
the
city
had
dropped
utterly
from
his
flying
imagination
there
was
only
one
that
remained
faithful
that
craving
for
beauty
against
him
dickie
still
pressed
his
door
shut
lorrimer
gift
of
work
had
not
quieted
the
leader
of
the
pack
but
it
had
brought
dickie
something
that
was
nearly
happiness
the
very
look
of
him
had
changed
he
looked
driven
rather
than
harried
keen
rather
than
harassed
eager
instead
of
vague
hungry
rather
than
wistful
only
sometimes
dickie
brain
would
suddenly
turn
blank
and
blind
from
sheer
exhaustion
this
happened
to
him
now
the
printed
lines
he
was
studying
lost
all
their
meaning
he
put
his
forehead
on
his
hands
then
he
heard
that
eerie
light
tapping
above
him
on
the
skylight
but
he
was
too
tired
to
look
up
it
was
on
that
very
afternoon
when
sheila
rode
down
the
trail
with
her
flowers
tied
before
her
on
the
saddle
singing
to
keep
up
her
heart
it
was
that
very
afternoon
when
she
had
cried
out
for
dickie
dickie
dickie
and
now
it
was
as
though
the
cry
had
traveled
that
a
memory
of
her
leapt
upon
his
mind
a
memory
of
sheila
singing
she
had
come
into
the
lobby
from
one
of
her
rides
with
jim
greely
she
had
held
a
handful
of
cactus
flowers
she
had
stopped
over
there
by
one
of
the
windows
to
put
them
in
a
glass
and
to
show
dickie
a
prisoner
at
his
desk
that
she
did
not
consider
his
presence
it
was
during
the
period
of
their
estrangement
she
had
sung
softly
as
a
girl
sings
when
she
knows
herself
to
be
alone
a
little
tender
sad
chanting
song
that
seemed
made
to
fit
her
mouth
the
pain
her
singing
had
given
him
that
afternoon
had
cut
a
picture
of
her
on
dickie
brain
just
because
he
had
tried
so
hard
not
to
look
at
her
now
it
jumped
out
at
him
against
his
closed
wet
lids
the
very
motions
of
her
mouth
came
back
the
positive
dear
curve
of
her
chin
the
throat
there
slim
against
the
light
hard
work
had
driven
her
image
a
little
from
his
mind
lately
it
returned
now
to
revenge
his
returned
with
a
song
dickie
got
up
and
wandered
about
the
room
he
tried
to
hum
the
air
but
his
throat
contracted
he
tried
to
whistle
but
his
lips
turned
stiff
he
bent
over
his
book
no
use
she
still
sang
all
night
he
was
tormented
by
that
chanting
hurting
song
he
sobbed
with
the
hurt
of
it
he
tossed
about
on
his
bed
he
could
not
but
remember
how
little
she
had
loved
him
all
at
once
there
came
to
him
a
mysterious
and
beautiful
release
it
seemed
that
the
cool
spirit
detached
winged
drew
him
to
itself
or
became
itself
entirely
possessed
of
him
he
was
taken
out
of
his
pain
and
yet
he
understood
it
and
he
began
suddenly
easily
to
put
it
into
words
the
misery
was
ecstasy
the
hurt
was
inspiration
the
song
sang
sweetly
as
though
it
had
been
sung
to
soothe
and
not
to
make
him
suffer
oh
little
song
you
sang
to
me
ah
yes
at
heart
she
had
been
singing
to
him
a
hundred
hundred
days
ago
oh
little
song
whose
melody
walks
in
my
heart
and
stumbles
so
i
can
not
bear
the
level
nights
and
all
the
days
are
and
all
the
hours
from
dark
to
dark
turn
to
a
little
song
dickie
not
knowing
how
he
got
there
was
at
his
table
again
he
was
writing
he
was
happy
beyond
any
conception
he
had
ever
had
of
happiness
that
there
was
agony
in
his
happiness
only
intensified
it
the
leader
of
the
beast
with
a
god
face
the
noblest
of
man
desires
that
passionate
and
humble
craving
for
beauty
had
him
by
the
throat
so
it
was
that
dickie
wrote
his
first
poem
chapter
x
winter
winter
snapped
at
hidden
creek
as
a
wolf
snaps
but
held
its
grip
as
a
bulldog
holds
his
there
came
a
few
november
days
when
all
the
air
and
sky
and
were
filled
with
summer
again
but
the
snow
that
had
poured
itself
down
so
steadily
in
that
october
storm
did
not
give
way
it
sank
a
trifle
at
noon
and
covered
itself
at
night
with
a
glare
of
ice
it
was
impossible
to
go
anywhere
except
on
sheila
quickly
learned
the
trick
and
plodded
with
bent
knees
limber
ankles
and
feet
through
the
winter
miracle
of
the
woods
it
was
another
revelation
of
pure
beauty
but
her
heart
was
too
sore
to
hold
the
splendor
as
it
had
held
the
gentler
beauty
of
summer
and
autumn
besides
little
by
little
she
was
aware
of
a
vague
encompassing
uneasiness
since
the
winter
jaws
had
snapped
them
in
setting
its
teeth
between
them
and
all
other
life
miss
blake
had
subtly
and
gradually
changed
it
was
as
though
her
stature
had
increased
her
color
deepened
sometimes
to
sheila
that
square
strong
body
seemed
to
fill
the
world
she
was
more
and
more
masterful
quicker
with
her
orders
charier
of
her
smiles
shorter
of
speech
and
temper
her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
redder
the
sparks
closer
to
flame
as
though
the
intense
cold
fanned
them
once
they
harnessed
the
dogs
to
the
sled
and
rode
down
the
country
for
the
mail
the
trip
they
made
together
sheila
sat
wrapped
in
furs
in
front
of
the
broad
figure
of
her
companion
who
stood
at
the
back
of
the
sledge
used
a
long
whip
and
shouted
to
the
dogs
by
name
in
her
great
musical
voice
of
which
the
mountain
echo
made
fine
use
they
sped
close
to
the
frozen
whiteness
of
the
world
streaked
down
the
slopes
and
were
drawn
soundlessly
through
the
columned
vistas
of
the
woods
here
there
and
everywhere
were
tracks
of
coyotes
fox
rabbit
martin
and
the
little
pointed
patteran
of
winter
birds
yet
they
saw
nothing
living
what
got
the
elk
and
moose
this
season
muttered
miss
blake
nothing
stirred
except
the
soft
plop
of
shaken
snow
or
the
little
flurry
of
drifting
flakes
these
lay
two
inches
deep
on
the
surface
of
the
snow
dry
and
distinct
all
day
in
the
cold
so
that
they
could
be
blown
apart
at
a
breath
miss
blake
was
cheerful
on
this
journey
she
sang
songs
she
told
brief
stories
of
other
sled
trips
at
the
an
old
lonely
man
delivered
them
some
parcels
and
a
vast
bagful
of
magazines
there
was
a
brief
passage
of
arms
between
him
and
miss
blake
she
accused
him
of
withholding
a
box
of
cartridges
and
would
not
be
content
till
she
had
poked
about
his
office
in
dark
corners
she
came
out
swearing
at
the
failure
of
her
search
i
needed
that
shot
she
said
my
supply
is
short
i
made
sure
it
be
here
there
were
no
letters
for
either
of
them
and
sheila
felt
again
that
queer
shiver
of
her
loneliness
but
on
the
whole
it
was
a
wonderful
day
and
under
a
world
of
most
amazing
stars
the
small
valiant
with
its
glowing
stove
and
its
hot
mess
of
supper
felt
like
home
not
long
after
that
came
the
first
stroke
of
fate
the
little
old
horse
left
them
and
though
they
shoed
patiently
for
miles
following
his
track
it
was
only
to
find
his
bones
gnawed
clean
by
coyotes
or
by
wolves
sheila
tears
froze
to
her
lashes
but
miss
blake
face
went
a
little
pale
she
said
nothing
and
in
her
steps
sheila
plodded
home
in
silence
that
evening
miss
blake
laid
hands
on
her
they
had
washed
up
their
dishes
sheila
was
putting
a
log
on
the
fire
it
rolled
out
of
her
grasp
to
the
bearskin
rug
and
struck
miss
blake
foot
before
sheila
could
even
say
her
quick
i
sorry
the
woman
had
come
at
her
with
a
sort
of
spring
had
gripped
her
by
the
shoulders
had
shaken
her
with
ferocity
and
let
her
go
sheila
fell
back
her
own
hands
raised
to
her
bruised
shoulders
her
eyes
phosphorescent
in
a
pale
face
miss
blake
how
dare
you
touch
me
the
woman
kicked
back
the
log
turned
a
red
face
and
laughed
dare
you
little
silly
what
to
scare
me
of
you
an
awful
conviction
of
helplessness
depressed
sheila
heart
but
she
kept
her
eyes
leveled
on
miss
blake
do
you
suppose
i
will
stay
here
with
you
one
hour
if
you
treat
me
like
this
that
brought
another
laugh
but
miss
blake
was
evidently
trying
to
make
light
of
her
outbreak
scared
you
did
i
she
said
i
guess
you
never
got
much
training
eh
i
am
not
a
dog
said
sheila
shortly
well
if
you
are
miss
blake
returned
to
her
chair
and
took
up
a
magazine
she
put
the
spectacles
on
her
nose
with
shaking
hands
my
girl
are
you
you
ca
expect
to
get
nothing
but
petting
from
me
sheila
if
she
had
not
been
icy
with
rage
sheila
might
have
smiled
at
this
i
do
know
what
you
mean
miss
blake
by
my
being
your
girl
i
work
for
you
to
be
sure
i
know
that
but
i
know
too
that
you
will
have
to
apologize
to
me
for
this
miss
blake
swung
one
leg
across
the
other
and
stared
above
her
glasses
apologize
to
yes
i
will
allow
nobody
to
touch
me
shucks
go
tell
that
to
the
marines
you
never
been
touched
have
you
sweet
sixteen
hudson
kiss
again
scorched
sheila
mouth
and
her
whole
body
burned
miss
blake
watched
that
fire
consume
her
and
again
she
laughed
i
waiting
for
you
to
apologize
said
sheila
again
this
time
between
small
set
teeth
well
my
girl
wait
that
cool
you
off
sheila
stood
and
felt
the
violent
beating
of
her
heart
a
log
in
the
wall
snapped
from
the
bitter
frost
miss
blake
she
said
presently
a
pitiful
young
quaver
in
her
voice
if
you
do
beg
my
pardon
i
go
miss
blake
flung
her
book
down
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
oh
quit
your
nonsense
sheila
she
said
what
a
shaking
you
know
you
get
out
of
here
it
take
you
a
week
to
get
anywhere
at
all
except
into
a
frozen
supper
for
the
coyotes
your
beau
left
the
country
madder
told
me
at
the
make
the
best
of
it
sheila
lucky
if
you
do
get
worse
than
that
before
spring
you
get
used
to
me
in
time
get
broken
in
and
learn
my
ways
i
not
half
bad
but
i
got
to
be
obeyed
i
got
to
be
master
that
me
what
do
you
think
i
come
out
here
to
the
wilderness
for
if
not
because
i
ca
stand
anything
less
than
being
master
here
i
got
my
place
and
my
dogs
and
a
world
that
do
talk
back
and
now
i
got
you
for
company
and
to
do
my
work
you
got
to
fall
into
line
sheila
right
in
the
ranks
once
some
one
out
there
in
the
world
she
made
a
gesture
dropped
her
chin
on
her
big
chest
and
looked
out
under
her
short
dense
eyelashes
tried
to
break
i
wo
tell
you
what
he
got
where
i
quit
the
ways
of
women
yes
and
the
ways
of
men
she
stood
up
and
walked
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
dogs
were
sleeping
in
their
kennels
but
a
chain
rattled
i
broke
the
you
seen
them
wriggle
on
their
bellies
for
me
have
you
well
my
girl
do
you
think
i
ca
break
you
she
wheeled
back
and
stood
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
it
was
at
that
moment
that
she
seemed
to
fill
the
world
her
ruddy
eyes
glowed
like
blood
they
were
not
quite
sane
that
was
it
sheila
went
suddenly
weak
they
were
not
sane
those
red
eyes
filled
with
sparks
the
girl
stepped
back
and
sat
down
in
her
chair
she
bent
forward
pressed
her
hands
flat
together
palm
to
palm
between
her
knees
and
stared
fixedly
down
at
them
she
made
no
secret
of
her
desperate
preoccupation
miss
blake
face
softened
a
little
at
this
withdrawal
she
came
back
to
her
place
and
resumed
her
spectacles
i
tell
you
why
i
snappy
she
said
presently
i
scared
this
startled
sheila
into
a
look
miss
blake
was
moistening
her
lips
that
horse
you
know
the
coyotes
got
him
i
guess
he
went
down
and
they
fell
upon
him
well
he
was
to
feed
the
dogs
with
until
i
could
get
my
winter
meat
what
do
you
mean
that
what
i
buy
for
little
old
horses
for
a
couple
of
bits
and
work
out
and
shoot
for
well
sheila
when
fed
they
dogs
but
when
they
starved
they
wolves
and
i
ca
think
what
come
to
the
elk
this
year
i
take
out
my
little
old
gun
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
she
took
her
gun
and
strapped
on
her
shoes
and
went
out
for
all
day
long
into
the
cold
each
time
she
came
back
more
exhausted
and
more
fierce
sheila
would
have
her
supper
ready
and
waiting
sometimes
for
hours
the
dogs
have
scared
off
said
miss
blake
that
must
be
the
truth
she
let
the
pack
hunt
for
itself
at
night
and
they
came
back
sometimes
with
bloody
jaws
but
the
prey
must
have
been
small
for
they
were
not
satisfied
they
grew
more
and
more
gaunt
and
wolfish
they
would
howl
for
hours
wailing
and
yelping
in
ragged
cadence
to
the
stars
and
brews
of
indian
meal
vanished
and
left
their
bellies
almost
as
empty
as
before
and
said
miss
blake
we
got
to
eat
ourselves
had
we
better
go
down
to
the
or
to
rusty
sheila
asked
nervously
miss
blake
snapped
at
her
harness
that
team
now
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
sheila
and
we
ca
make
it
on
foot
we
drop
in
our
tracks
and
freeze
if
it
comes
to
the
worst
we
may
have
to
try
it
but
oh
get
something
but
brought
no
better
luck
during
the
hunting
the
dogs
were
left
on
their
chains
and
sheila
through
the
lonely
hours
would
watch
them
through
the
window
and
could
almost
see
the
wolfishness
grow
in
their
deep
wild
eyes
she
would
try
to
talk
to
them
pat
them
coax
them
into
but
day
by
day
they
responded
more
unwillingly
all
but
berg
berg
stayed
with
her
in
the
house
lay
on
her
feet
leaned
against
her
knee
he
shared
her
meals
he
was
beginning
to
swing
his
heart
from
miss
blake
to
her
and
this
was
the
second
cause
for
strife
since
that
one
outbreak
sheila
had
gone
carefully
she
was
dignified
aloof
very
still
she
obeyed
and
slaved
as
she
had
never
done
in
the
summer
days
the
dread
of
physical
violence
hung
on
her
brain
like
a
cloud
she
encouraged
berg
affection
and
wondered
if
it
came
to
a
struggle
whether
he
would
side
with
her
she
was
given
the
opportunity
to
put
this
matter
to
the
test
miss
blake
was
very
late
that
night
it
was
midnight
a
stark
midnight
of
stars
and
biting
cold
when
berg
stood
up
from
his
sleep
and
barked
his
low
short
bark
of
welcome
outside
the
other
dogs
broke
into
their
clamor
drowning
all
other
sound
and
in
the
midst
of
it
the
door
flew
rudely
open
miss
blake
stood
and
clung
to
the
side
of
the
door
her
face
was
she
put
out
her
hand
toward
sheila
clutching
the
air
sheila
ran
over
to
her
you
hurt
twisted
my
blamed
ankle
god
she
hobbled
over
a
heavy
arm
round
sheila
to
her
chair
and
sat
there
while
the
girl
gave
her
some
brandy
removed
the
snowshoes
and
cut
away
the
boot
from
a
swollen
and
discolored
leg
that
the
end
of
my
hunting
grunted
the
patient
who
bore
the
agony
of
rubbing
and
bathing
stoically
and
i
reckon
i
could
have
stood
much
more
she
clenched
her
hand
in
berg
mane
god
those
dogs
have
to
shoot
them
next
sheila
looked
up
to
her
with
a
sort
of
horrified
hope
there
was
then
a
way
out
from
that
fear
i
rather
die
i
think
said
the
woman
hoarsely
i
love
those
dogs
sheila
looked
up
into
a
tender
and
quivering
face
the
face
of
a
mother
they
mean
something
to
me
those
brutes
i
guess
i
kind
of
centered
my
heart
on
out
here
alone
i
raised
up
from
puppies
all
but
berg
and
the
mother
they
were
the
cutest
little
fellows
i
remember
when
wreck
got
porcupine
quills
in
his
nose
and
came
to
me
and
lay
on
his
back
and
whined
to
me
it
was
as
if
he
said
me
momma
sure
it
was
and
he
pretty
near
died
oh
damn
if
i
have
to
shoot
i
might
just
as
well
shoot
myself
and
be
done
with
it
thanks
sheila
i
eat
my
supper
here
and
then
you
can
help
me
to
bed
when
my
ankle
all
well
we
can
have
a
try
for
the
perhaps
she
leaned
back
and
drew
berg
roughly
up
against
her
she
caressed
him
he
made
little
soft
throaty
sounds
of
tenderness
sheila
came
back
with
a
tray
and
as
she
came
berg
pulled
himself
away
from
his
mistress
and
went
wagging
over
to
greet
her
come
here
snapped
miss
blake
berg
hesitated
cuddled
close
to
sheila
and
kept
step
beside
her
miss
blake
eyes
went
red
come
here
she
said
again
berg
did
not
cringe
or
hasten
he
reached
miss
blake
chair
at
the
same
instant
as
sheila
not
a
moment
earlier
miss
blake
pulled
herself
up
the
tray
went
shattering
to
the
floor
she
hobbled
over
to
the
fire
white
with
the
anguish
took
down
the
whip
from
its
nail
at
that
berg
cringed
and
whined
the
woman
fell
upon
him
with
her
terrible
lash
she
held
herself
with
one
hand
on
the
while
with
the
other
she
scored
the
howling
victim
his
fur
came
off
his
back
under
the
dreadful
blows
oh
stop
cried
sheila
stop
you
killing
him
she
ran
over
and
caught
miss
blake
arm
damn
you
said
the
woman
fiercely
she
stood
breathing
fast
sweat
of
pain
and
rage
and
exertion
stood
out
on
her
face
do
want
that
whip
she
lifting
her
lash
and
at
that
with
a
snarl
berg
crouched
himself
and
bared
his
teeth
miss
blake
started
and
stared
at
him
suddenly
she
gave
in
pain
and
anger
twisted
her
spirit
you
turn
my
berg
against
me
she
choked
and
fell
heavily
down
on
the
rug
in
a
dead
faint
when
she
came
to
she
was
grim
and
silent
she
got
herself
with
scant
help
to
bed
her
big
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
and
for
a
week
she
was
kept
there
with
fever
and
much
pain
berg
lay
beside
her
or
followed
sheila
about
her
work
and
the
woman
watched
them
both
with
ruddy
eyes
chapter
xi
the
pack
in
january
a
wind
blew
steadily
from
the
east
and
snow
came
as
if
to
bury
them
alive
the
cabin
turned
to
a
cave
a
small
square
of
warmth
under
a
mountain
of
impenetrable
white
one
door
and
one
window
only
opening
to
a
space
of
sun
against
the
others
the
blank
white
lids
of
winter
pressed
sheila
shoveled
this
space
out
sometimes
twice
a
day
the
dog
kennels
were
moved
into
it
and
stood
against
the
side
of
a
eight
feet
high
up
which
when
they
were
unchained
the
gaunt
wolfish
animals
leapt
in
a
loosely
formed
pack
the
great
mother
brenda
at
their
head
and
padded
off
into
the
silent
woods
in
their
hungry
search
for
food
but
one
day
they
refused
to
go
miss
blake
her
whip
in
her
hand
limped
out
the
snow
had
stopped
the
day
was
still
and
bright
again
above
the
snowy
firs
the
mountain
scraped
against
the
blue
sky
like
a
cliff
of
broken
ice
the
dogs
had
crept
out
of
their
houses
and
were
squatted
or
huddled
in
the
sun
as
she
came
out
they
rose
and
strained
at
their
tethers
one
of
them
whined
brenda
the
mother
bared
her
teeth
one
by
one
as
they
were
freed
they
slunk
close
to
miss
blake
looking
up
into
her
face
they
crowded
close
at
her
heels
as
she
went
back
to
the
house
she
had
to
push
the
door
to
in
their
very
jaws
and
they
pressed
against
it
their
heads
hung
low
sniffing
the
odor
of
food
presently
a
hideous
howling
rose
from
them
time
and
again
miss
blake
drove
them
away
with
lash
and
voice
time
and
again
they
came
back
they
scratched
at
the
threshold
whimpered
and
whined
sheila
and
miss
blake
gave
them
what
food
they
would
have
eaten
themselves
that
day
it
served
only
to
excite
their
restlessness
to
hold
them
there
at
the
crack
of
the
door
snuffling
and
slobbering
the
outer
circle
slept
the
inner
watched
then
they
would
shift
like
sentries
they
had
a
horrible
sort
of
system
most
of
that
dreadful
afternoon
miss
blake
paced
the
floor
trying
to
strengthen
her
ankle
for
the
trip
to
the
at
sunset
when
the
small
room
was
nearly
dark
she
stopped
threw
up
her
head
and
looked
at
sheila
the
girl
was
sitting
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
ladder
washing
some
dried
apples
her
face
had
thinned
to
a
silvery
wedge
between
the
thick
square
masses
of
her
hair
there
was
a
haunted
look
in
her
clear
eyes
the
soft
mouth
had
tightened
how
in
god
name
said
miss
blake
shall
i
get
on
their
chains
again
sheila
stopped
her
work
and
her
lips
fell
helplessly
apart
she
looked
up
at
the
older
woman
and
shook
her
head
miss
blake
fear
snapped
into
a
sort
of
frenzy
she
gritted
her
teeth
and
stamped
you
simpleton
she
said
you
never
have
a
notion
in
your
head
sheila
stood
up
quickly
something
told
her
that
she
had
better
be
on
her
feet
she
kept
very
still
you
will
know
better
than
i
could
what
to
do
about
the
dogs
she
said
quietly
they
go
back
on
their
chains
for
you
i
should
think
they
afraid
of
you
are
you
miss
blake
asked
roughly
no
of
course
not
you
little
liar
you
scared
half
out
of
your
wits
you
scared
of
the
whole
thing
scared
of
the
snow
scared
of
the
cold
scared
of
the
dogs
and
scared
sick
of
me
come
now
tell
me
the
truth
it
was
almost
her
old
bluff
bullying
tone
but
back
of
it
was
a
disorder
of
stretched
nerves
sheila
weighed
her
words
and
tried
to
weigh
her
thoughts
i
do
think
i
am
afraid
miss
blake
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
the
dogs
if
you
are
and
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
you
you
have
been
good
to
me
you
are
a
good
woman
at
this
miss
blake
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
she
was
terribly
like
one
of
the
dogs
howling
there
was
something
wild
and
wolfish
in
her
broad
neck
and
in
the
sound
she
made
and
she
snapped
back
into
silence
with
wolfish
suddenness
if
you
not
scared
then
she
scoffed
go
and
chain
up
the
dogs
yourself
for
an
instant
sheila
quite
calmly
balanced
the
danger
out
of
doors
against
the
danger
within
i
think
she
said
and
managed
one
of
her
drifting
smiles
i
think
i
am
a
great
deal
more
afraid
of
the
dogs
than
i
am
of
you
miss
blake
the
woman
studied
her
for
a
minute
in
silence
then
she
walked
over
to
her
throne
and
sat
down
on
it
she
leaned
back
in
a
royal
way
and
spread
her
dark
broad
hands
across
the
arms
well
she
said
coolly
did
you
hear
what
i
said
go
out
and
chain
up
the
dogs
sheila
held
herself
like
a
slim
little
cavalier
if
i
go
out
she
said
coolly
i
will
not
take
a
whip
i
take
a
gun
and
shoot
my
dogs
miss
blake
what
else
is
left
for
us
to
do
we
ca
let
them
claw
down
the
door
and
tear
us
into
bits
can
we
you
shoot
my
dogs
you
said
yourself
that
we
might
have
to
shoot
them
miss
blake
gave
her
a
stealthy
and
cunning
look
take
my
gun
then
her
voice
rose
to
a
key
that
was
both
crafty
and
triumphant
and
much
good
it
will
do
you
there
shot
enough
to
kill
one
if
you
are
a
shot
i
lost
what
was
left
of
my
ammunition
the
day
i
hurt
my
ankle
the
new
stuff
is
down
at
the
by
now
i
guess
the
long
silence
was
filled
by
the
shifting
of
the
outside
the
door
we
must
chain
them
up
at
any
cost
said
sheila
her
lips
were
dry
and
felt
cold
to
her
tongue
go
out
and
do
it
then
the
mistress
of
the
house
leaned
back
and
crossed
her
ankles
miss
blake
be
reasonable
you
have
a
great
deal
of
control
over
the
dogs
and
i
have
none
i
afraid
of
them
and
they
will
know
it
animals
always
know
when
you
afraid
again
she
managed
a
smile
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
are
a
coward
she
said
at
that
miss
blake
stood
up
from
her
chair
her
face
was
red
with
a
violent
rush
of
blood
and
the
sparks
in
her
eyes
seemed
to
have
broken
into
flame
very
good
miss
she
said
brutally
i
go
out
and
chain
up
and
then
i
come
back
and
thrash
you
to
a
frazzle
then
you
know
how
to
obey
my
orders
next
time
she
caught
up
her
whip
swung
it
in
her
hand
and
strode
to
the
door
and
mind
you
sheila
you
wo
be
able
to
hide
yourself
from
me
nor
make
a
getaway
i
lock
this
door
outside
and
winter
locked
the
other
you
wait
you
see
what
you
get
for
calling
me
a
coward
your
friend
berg
gone
off
on
a
long
hunt
he
left
his
friends
outside
there
and
he
left
you
understand
she
shouted
roughly
to
the
dogs
snapped
her
whip
threw
open
the
door
and
stepped
out
boldly
she
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
shot
a
bolt
it
creaked
as
though
it
had
grown
rusty
with
disuse
in
the
stillness
for
except
for
a
quick
shuffling
of
paws
there
was
no
sound
at
first
sheila
chose
her
weapon
of
defense
she
took
down
from
its
place
the
eskimo
ivory
spear
and
holding
it
short
in
her
hand
she
put
herself
behind
the
great
chair
her
celtic
blood
was
pounding
gloriously
now
she
was
not
afraid
though
if
there
had
been
time
to
notice
it
she
would
have
confessed
to
an
abysmal
sense
of
horror
and
despair
and
again
she
wondered
at
her
own
loneliness
and
youth
and
the
astounding
danger
that
she
faced
yes
it
was
more
astonishment
than
any
other
emotion
that
possessed
her
consciousness
the
horror
was
below
the
threshold
practicing
its
part
then
anger
astonishment
horror
itself
were
suddenly
thrown
out
of
her
she
was
left
like
an
empty
vessel
waiting
to
be
filled
with
fear
miss
blake
had
cried
aloud
help
sheila
help
this
was
followed
by
a
dreadful
screaming
sheila
dropped
her
spear
and
leapt
to
the
door
on
it
outside
miss
blake
beat
and
screamed
open
for
god
sake
sheila
shouted
in
as
dreadful
a
key
on
your
side
the
bolt
miss
blake
the
bolt
fingers
clawed
at
the
bolt
but
it
would
not
slip
through
all
the
horrible
sounds
the
woman
made
sheila
could
hear
the
snarling
and
leaping
and
snapping
of
the
dogs
she
dashed
to
the
small
tight
window
broke
a
pane
with
her
fist
and
thrust
out
her
arm
she
meant
to
reach
the
bolt
but
what
she
saw
took
the
warm
life
out
of
her
miss
blake
had
gone
down
under
the
whirling
slobbering
pack
the
screaming
had
stopped
in
that
one
awful
look
the
poor
child
saw
that
no
human
help
could
save
she
dropped
down
on
the
floor
and
lay
there
moaning
her
hands
pressed
over
her
ears
so
she
lay
shuddering
and
gasping
the
great
part
of
the
night
at
last
the
intense
cold
drove
her
to
the
fire
she
heaped
up
the
logs
high
and
hung
close
above
them
her
very
heart
was
cold
liquid
ice
moved
sluggishly
along
her
veins
the
morning
brought
no
comfort
or
courage
to
her
only
a
freshening
of
horror
and
of
fear
the
dogs
had
gone
and
all
the
winter
world
lay
still
about
the
house
she
was
shaken
by
a
regular
pulse
of
nervous
sobbing
but
driven
by
a
sort
of
restlessness
she
made
herself
coffee
and
forced
some
food
down
her
contracted
throat
then
she
put
on
her
coat
took
down
miss
and
cartridge
belt
and
saw
with
a
slight
relaxing
of
the
cramp
about
her
heart
that
there
were
four
shots
in
the
chamber
four
shots
and
eight
dogs
but
at
least
she
could
save
herself
from
death
she
strapped
the
gun
round
her
slim
hips
filled
her
pockets
with
supplies
a
box
of
dried
raisins
some
hard
bread
a
cake
of
chocolate
some
matches
pulled
her
cap
down
over
her
ears
and
took
her
snowshoes
from
the
wall
with
closed
eyes
she
put
her
arm
out
through
the
broken
pane
and
after
a
short
struggle
slipped
the
rusty
bolt
then
she
went
over
to
the
door
and
leaning
against
it
prayed
even
with
the
mysterious
strength
she
drew
from
that
sense
of
kinship
with
a
superhuman
power
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
force
herself
to
open
at
last
with
a
big
gasp
she
flung
the
door
wide
skirted
the
house
her
hands
against
the
logs
her
eyes
shut
ran
across
the
open
space
scrambled
up
the
drift
tied
on
her
snowshoes
and
fled
away
under
the
pines
there
moved
in
all
the
wilderness
that
day
no
more
hunted
and
fearful
a
thing
the
fresh
snow
sunk
a
little
under
her
webs
but
she
was
a
featherweight
of
girlhood
and
made
quicker
and
easier
progress
than
would
have
been
possible
to
any
one
else
but
a
child
and
her
fear
gave
her
both
strength
and
speed
sometimes
she
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
always
she
strained
her
ears
for
the
pad
of
following
feet
it
was
a
day
of
rainbows
and
of
diamond
spray
where
the
sun
struck
the
shaken
snow
sifted
from
overweighted
branches
sheila
remembered
well
enough
the
route
to
the
it
meant
miles
of
weary
plodding
but
she
thought
that
she
could
do
it
before
night
if
not
she
would
travel
by
starlight
and
the
wan
reflection
of
the
snow
there
was
no
darkness
in
these
clear
keen
nights
she
would
not
tell
herself
what
gave
her
strength
such
impetus
she
thought
resolutely
of
the
of
the
old
friendly
man
of
his
stove
of
his
chairs
and
his
picture
of
the
president
of
his
gun
laid
across
two
nails
against
his
kitchen
wall
all
this
not
more
than
eighteen
miles
away
and
she
thought
of
hilliard
too
of
his
young
strength
and
the
bold
young
glitter
of
his
eyes
she
stopped
for
a
minute
at
noon
to
drink
some
water
from
hidden
creek
and
to
eat
a
bite
or
so
of
bread
she
was
pulling
on
her
gloves
again
when
a
distant
baying
first
reached
her
ears
she
turned
faint
seemed
to
stand
in
a
mist
then
with
her
teeth
set
defiantly
she
started
again
faster
and
steadier
her
body
bent
forward
her
head
turned
back
before
her
now
lay
a
great
stretch
of
undulating
unbroken
white
at
its
farther
edge
the
line
of
pines
began
again
she
strained
her
steps
to
reach
this
shelter
the
baying
had
been
very
faint
and
far
away
it
might
have
been
sounded
for
some
other
hunting
she
would
make
the
woods
take
off
her
webs
climb
up
into
a
tree
and
perhaps
attracted
by
those
four
shots
no
three
she
must
save
one
some
trapper
some
unimaginable
wanderer
in
the
winter
forest
would
come
to
her
and
rescue
her
before
the
end
so
her
mind
twisted
itself
with
hope
but
an
hour
later
with
the
pines
not
very
far
away
the
baying
rose
so
close
behind
that
it
stopped
her
heart
twenty
minutes
had
passed
when
above
a
rise
of
ground
she
saw
the
shaggy
trotting
body
of
brenda
the
leader
of
the
pack
she
was
running
slowly
her
nose
close
to
the
snow
casting
a
little
right
and
left
over
the
tracks
sheila
counted
eight
berg
then
had
joined
them
she
thought
that
she
could
distinguish
him
in
the
rear
it
was
now
late
afternoon
and
the
sun
slanted
driving
back
the
shadows
of
the
nearing
trees
of
sheila
of
the
dogs
it
all
seemed
fantastic
the
weird
beauty
of
the
scene
the
weird
horror
of
it
sheila
reckoned
the
distance
before
her
reckoned
the
speed
of
the
dogs
she
knew
now
that
there
was
no
hope
ahead
of
her
rose
a
sharp
sudden
slope
she
could
never
make
it
there
came
to
her
quite
suddenly
like
a
gift
a
complete
release
from
fear
she
stopped
and
wheeled
it
seemed
that
the
brutes
had
not
yet
seen
her
they
were
nose
down
at
the
scent
one
by
one
they
vanished
in
a
little
dip
of
ground
one
by
one
they
reappeared
two
yards
away
sheila
pulled
out
her
gun
deliberately
aimed
and
fired
a
spurt
of
snow
showed
that
she
had
aimed
short
but
the
loud
sudden
report
made
brenda
swerve
all
the
dogs
stopped
and
slunk
together
circling
their
haunches
lowered
wreck
squatted
threw
up
his
head
and
howled
sheila
spoke
to
them
clear
and
loud
her
young
voice
ringing
out
into
that
loneliness
you
berg
good
dog
come
here
one
of
the
shaggy
animals
moved
toward
her
timidly
looking
back
pausing
brenda
snarled
berg
come
here
boy
sheila
patted
her
knee
at
this
the
big
dog
whined
cringed
and
began
to
swarm
up
the
slope
toward
her
on
his
belly
his
eyes
shifted
the
struggle
of
his
mind
was
pitifully
visible
the
and
the
and
against
them
that
queer
hunger
for
the
love
and
the
touch
of
man
sheila
could
not
tell
if
it
were
hunger
or
loyalty
that
was
creeping
up
to
her
in
the
body
of
the
beast
she
kept
her
gun
leveled
on
him
when
he
had
come
to
within
two
feet
of
her
he
paused
then
from
behind
him
rose
the
starved
baying
of
his
brothers
sheila
looked
up
they
were
bounding
toward
her
all
wolf
these
but
more
dangerous
after
their
taste
of
human
blood
than
wolves
to
the
bristling
hair
along
their
backs
and
the
bared
fangs
again
she
fired
this
time
she
struck
wreck
paw
he
lifted
it
and
howled
she
fired
again
brenda
snapped
sideways
at
her
shoulder
but
was
not
checked
there
was
one
shot
left
sheila
knew
how
it
must
be
used
quickly
she
turned
the
muzzle
up
toward
her
own
head
then
behind
her
came
a
sharp
loud
explosion
brenda
leapt
high
into
the
air
and
fell
at
sheila
feet
at
that
first
berg
fled
with
shadow
swiftness
through
the
trees
for
the
rest
it
was
as
though
a
magic
wall
had
stopped
them
as
though
at
a
certain
point
they
fell
upon
death
crack
crack
crack
one
after
another
they
came
up
leapt
and
dropped
choking
and
bleeding
on
the
snow
at
the
end
sheila
turned
blindly
a
yard
behind
her
and
slightly
above
her
there
under
the
pines
stood
hilliard
very
pale
his
gun
tucked
under
his
arm
the
smoking
muzzle
lowered
weakly
she
felt
her
way
up
toward
him
groping
with
her
hands
he
slid
down
noiselessly
on
his
long
skis
and
she
stood
clinging
to
his
arm
looking
up
dumbly
into
his
strained
face
i
heard
your
shots
he
said
breathlessly
you
within
a
hundred
yards
of
my
house
for
months
i
been
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
to
come
to
you
god
forgive
me
sheila
for
not
coming
before
swinging
his
gun
on
its
strap
across
his
shoulder
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
like
a
child
she
was
carried
through
the
silence
of
the
woods
all
barred
with
glimmers
from
a
setting
sun
chapter
xii
the
good
old
world
again
hilliard
carried
sheila
into
the
house
that
he
had
built
for
her
and
laid
her
down
in
that
big
bedroom
that
got
the
morning
sun
for
a
while
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
would
never
open
her
eyes
again
and
when
she
did
regain
consciousness
she
was
so
prostrate
with
her
long
fear
and
the
shock
of
miss
blake
death
that
she
lay
there
too
weak
to
smile
or
speak
too
weak
almost
to
breathe
hilliard
turned
nurse
a
puzzled
anxious
nurse
he
would
sit
up
in
his
half
the
night
and
when
sleep
overpowered
his
anxiety
he
would
fall
prone
on
the
rug
before
his
fire
at
last
sheila
pulled
herself
up
and
crept
about
the
house
she
spent
a
day
in
the
big
log
chair
before
hilliard
hearth
looking
very
wan
shrinking
from
speech
her
soft
mouth
gray
and
drawn
are
you
ever
going
to
smile
for
me
again
he
asked
her
after
a
long
during
which
he
had
stood
as
still
as
stone
his
arm
along
the
pine
mantelshelf
looking
at
her
from
the
shelter
of
a
propping
hand
she
lifted
her
face
to
him
and
made
a
pitiful
effort
enough
but
it
brought
tears
they
ran
down
her
cheeks
and
she
leaned
back
and
closed
her
lids
but
the
crystal
drops
forced
themselves
out
clung
to
her
lashes
and
fell
down
on
her
clenched
hands
hilliard
went
over
to
her
and
took
the
small
cold
hands
in
both
of
his
tell
me
about
what
happened
sheila
he
begged
her
it
will
help
word
by
difficult
word
he
still
holding
fast
to
her
hands
she
sobbed
and
gasped
out
her
story
to
which
he
listened
with
a
whitening
face
he
gripped
her
hands
tighter
then
toward
the
end
he
rose
with
a
sharp
oath
lit
his
cigarette
paced
to
and
fro
god
he
said
at
the
last
and
she
told
you
i
had
gone
from
the
country
the
devil
i
ca
help
saying
it
sheila
she
tortured
you
she
deserved
what
god
sent
her
oh
no
sheila
rocked
to
and
fro
no
one
could
deserve
such
dreadful
terror
and
pain
she
she
was
sane
i
was
foolish
to
trust
her
i
am
so
foolish
i
think
i
must
be
too
young
or
too
stupid
for
for
all
this
i
thought
the
world
would
be
a
much
safer
place
she
looked
up
again
and
speech
had
given
her
tormented
nerves
relief
for
her
eyes
were
much
more
like
her
own
clear
and
young
again
hilliard
what
shall
i
do
with
my
life
i
wonder
i
lost
my
faith
and
trustingness
i
horribly
afraid
he
stood
before
her
and
spoke
in
a
gentle
and
reasonable
tone
i
tell
you
the
answer
to
that
he
said
i
thought
that
all
out
while
i
been
taking
care
of
you
she
waited
anxiously
with
parted
lips
well
you
see
it
like
this
i
plumb
ashamed
of
myself
through
and
through
for
the
way
i
have
acted
toward
you
i
was
a
fool
to
listen
to
that
dern
lunatic
she
told
me
lies
about
you
miss
blake
did
yes
his
face
crimsoned
under
her
look
sheila
closed
her
eyes
and
frowned
a
faint
pink
stole
up
into
her
face
she
lifted
her
lids
again
and
he
saw
the
brightness
of
anger
and
of
course
you
took
her
lies
for
the
truth
oh
damn
now
you
mad
with
me
and
you
wo
listen
to
my
plan
he
was
so
childish
in
this
outbreak
that
sheila
was
moved
to
dim
amusement
i
too
beaten
to
be
angry
at
anything
she
said
just
tell
me
your
plan
no
he
said
sullenly
i
wait
i
scared
to
tell
you
now
she
did
not
urge
him
and
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
that
he
spoke
about
his
plan
she
had
got
out
to
her
chair
again
and
had
made
a
pretense
of
eating
an
mess
of
canned
stuff
which
he
had
brought
to
her
on
a
tray
it
was
after
he
had
taken
this
breakfast
away
that
he
broke
out
as
though
his
excitement
had
forced
a
lock
i
going
down
to
rusty
he
said
his
eyes
were
shining
he
looked
at
her
boldly
enough
now
and
take
me
sheila
up
and
take
me
no
you
to
stay
here
safe
and
snug
she
dropped
back
leave
everything
handy
for
you
there
enough
food
here
for
an
army
and
enough
fuel
you
as
safe
here
as
though
you
were
at
the
foot
of
god
throne
do
look
like
that
girl
i
ca
take
you
not
strong
enough
to
make
the
journey
in
this
cold
even
on
a
sled
and
we
ca
his
voice
sunk
and
his
eyes
fell
we
ca
go
on
like
this
i
reckon
sheila
forehead
was
puckered
her
fingers
trembled
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
then
with
a
sort
of
quaver
she
added
oh
why
ca
we
go
on
like
this
till
the
snow
goes
and
i
can
travel
with
you
because
he
said
roughly
we
ca
you
take
my
word
for
it
after
a
pause
he
went
on
in
his
former
decisive
tone
i
be
back
in
two
or
three
days
i
fetch
the
parson
sheila
sat
up
straight
his
eyes
held
hers
yes
the
parson
i
going
to
marry
you
sheila
she
repeated
this
like
a
lesson
you
are
going
to
marry
me
yes
you
have
three
days
to
think
it
over
if
you
do
want
to
marry
me
when
the
parson
comes
why
you
can
just
go
back
to
rusty
with
him
he
laughed
a
little
came
over
to
her
put
a
hand
on
each
arm
of
her
chair
and
bent
down
she
shrank
back
before
him
his
eyes
had
the
glitter
of
a
hawk
and
his
red
and
beautiful
lips
were
soft
and
eager
and
again
a
little
cruel
no
he
said
i
wo
kiss
you
till
i
come
back
not
even
for
then
you
know
how
i
feel
about
you
you
know
that
i
believe
that
you
a
good
girl
and
sheila
here
he
seemed
to
melt
and
falter
before
her
he
slipped
down
with
one
of
his
graceful
latin
movements
and
hid
his
forehead
on
her
knees
sheila
my
that
i
know
you
are
fit
oh
so
much
more
than
fit
to
be
the
mother
of
my
children
in
half
an
hour
during
which
they
were
both
profoundly
silent
he
came
to
her
again
he
was
ready
for
his
journey
she
was
sitting
far
back
in
her
chair
her
slim
legs
stretched
out
she
raised
inscrutable
eyes
wide
to
his
he
said
softly
it
hard
to
leave
you
she
said
even
more
softly
with
no
change
in
her
look
and
he
went
out
looking
at
her
over
his
shoulder
till
the
last
second
she
heard
the
voice
of
his
skis
hissing
across
the
hard
crust
of
the
snow
she
sat
there
stiff
and
still
till
the
great
wordless
silence
settled
down
again
then
she
started
up
from
her
chair
ran
across
to
the
window
and
saw
that
he
was
indeed
gone
she
came
storming
back
and
threw
herself
down
upon
the
hide
she
cried
like
a
deserted
child
oh
cosme
i
afraid
to
be
alone
i
afraid
why
did
i
let
you
go
come
back
oh
please
come
back
it
was
late
that
night
when
hilliard
reached
rusty
traveling
with
all
his
young
strength
across
the
easy
polished
surface
of
the
world
he
was
he
went
first
to
the
saloon
then
to
the
to
his
astonishment
he
found
a
letter
it
was
postmarked
new
york
and
he
recognized
the
small
cramped
hand
of
the
family
lawyer
he
took
the
letter
up
to
his
bedroom
in
the
lander
hotel
and
sat
on
the
bed
turning
the
square
envelope
about
in
his
hands
at
last
he
opened
it
my
dear
cosme
the
lawyer
had
written
he
had
known
hilliard
as
a
child
it
is
my
strong
hope
that
this
letter
will
reach
you
promptly
and
safely
at
the
address
you
sent
me
your
grandfather
death
on
the
fifteenth
instant
leaves
you
as
you
are
no
doubt
aware
heir
to
his
fortune
reckoned
at
about
thirty
millions
if
you
will
wire
on
receipt
of
this
and
follow
wire
in
person
as
soon
as
convenient
it
will
greatly
facilitate
arrangements
it
is
extremely
important
that
you
should
come
at
once
every
day
makes
things
more
complicated
in
the
management
of
the
estate
i
remain
with
congratulations
sincerely
your
friend
the
young
man
sat
there
dazed
he
had
always
known
about
those
millions
the
expectation
of
them
had
always
vaguely
dazzled
his
imagination
tampered
more
than
he
was
aware
with
the
sincerity
of
his
feelings
with
the
reality
of
his
life
but
now
the
shower
of
gold
had
fallen
all
about
him
and
his
fancy
stretched
its
eyes
to
take
in
the
immediate
glitter
why
thought
hilliard
this
turns
life
upside
down
i
can
begin
to
live
i
can
go
east
he
saw
that
the
world
and
its
gifts
were
as
truly
his
as
though
he
were
a
fairy
prince
a
sort
of
confusion
of
highly
colored
pictures
danced
through
his
quick
and
ignorant
brain
the
blood
pounded
in
his
ears
he
got
up
and
prowled
about
the
little
room
it
was
oppressively
small
he
felt
caged
the
widest
prairie
would
have
given
him
scant
he
was
planning
his
trip
to
the
east
when
the
thought
of
sheila
first
struck
him
like
a
cold
wave
or
rather
it
was
as
if
the
wave
of
his
selfish
excitement
had
crashed
against
the
wave
of
his
desire
for
her
all
was
foam
and
confusion
in
his
spirit
he
was
quite
incapable
of
a
virtue
in
which
his
free
life
and
his
temperament
had
given
him
little
training
it
was
simply
a
war
of
impulses
his
instinct
was
to
give
up
nothing
to
keep
hold
of
every
gift
he
wanted
as
he
had
never
in
his
life
wanted
anything
before
to
have
his
fling
he
wanted
his
birthright
of
experience
he
had
cut
himself
off
from
all
the
gentle
ways
of
his
inheritance
and
lived
like
a
very
ishmael
through
no
fault
of
his
own
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
before
he
settled
down
to
the
soberness
of
marriage
he
must
take
one
hasty
heady
compensating
draft
of
life
of
the
sort
of
life
he
might
have
had
he
would
go
east
go
at
once
he
would
fling
himself
into
a
tumultuous
bath
of
pleasure
and
then
he
would
come
back
to
sheila
and
lay
a
great
gift
of
gold
at
her
feet
he
thought
over
his
plans
reconstructing
them
he
got
pen
and
ink
and
wrote
a
letter
to
sheila
he
wrote
badly
a
schoolboy
inexpressive
letter
but
he
told
his
story
and
his
astounding
news
and
drew
a
vivid
enough
picture
of
the
havoc
it
had
wrought
in
his
simplicity
he
used
a
lover
language
but
his
letter
was
as
cold
and
lumpish
as
a
golden
ingot
and
yet
the
writer
was
not
cold
he
was
throbbing
and
distraught
confused
and
overthrown
a
boy
of
fourteen
beside
himself
at
the
prospect
of
a
holiday
it
was
a
stolen
holiday
to
be
sure
a
sort
of
truancy
from
manliness
but
none
the
less
intoxicating
for
that
cosme
latin
nature
was
on
top
saxon
loyalty
and
conscience
overthrown
he
was
an
egoist
to
his
that
night
he
did
not
sleep
a
wink
did
not
even
try
but
lay
on
his
back
across
the
bed
hands
locked
over
his
hair
while
visions
of
sugar
plums
danced
through
his
head
in
the
morning
he
went
down
and
made
his
arrangements
for
sheila
a
little
less
complete
perhaps
than
he
had
intended
for
he
met
a
worthy
citizen
of
rusty
starting
up
the
country
with
a
sled
to
visit
his
traps
and
to
him
he
gave
the
letter
and
confided
his
perplexities
it
was
a
hasty
interview
for
the
stage
was
about
to
start
my
wife
will
sure
take
your
girl
and
welcome
do
even
have
to
ask
her
the
old
fellow
assured
hilliard
we
be
glad
to
have
her
for
a
couple
of
months
she
like
the
kids
it
be
home
for
her
yes
sir
he
patted
the
excited
traveler
on
the
shoulder
you
pile
into
the
stage
and
do
you
worry
any
i
be
up
at
your
place
before
night
and
bring
the
lady
down
on
my
sled
yes
sir
pile
in
and
you
worry
any
cosme
wrung
his
hand
avoided
his
clear
eye
and
climbed
up
beside
the
driver
on
the
stage
he
did
not
look
after
the
trapper
he
stared
ahead
beyond
the
horses
to
the
high
white
hill
against
a
low
and
heavy
sky
of
clouds
there
a
big
snowstorm
a
comin
down
growled
the
driver
lucky
if
we
make
the
hill
a
oldtimer
it
agoin
to
be
and
cold
ugh
cosme
hardly
heard
this
speech
the
gray
world
was
a
golden
ball
for
him
to
spin
at
his
will
midas
had
touched
the
snow
the
sleigh
started
with
a
jerk
and
a
jingle
in
a
moment
it
was
running
lightly
with
a
crisp
cutting
noise
cosme
thoughts
outran
it
leaping
toward
their
gaudy
goal
a
journey
out
to
life
and
a
journey
back
to
love
no
wonder
his
golden
eyes
shone
and
his
cheeks
flushed
you
look
almighty
glad
to
be
going
out
of
here
the
driver
made
comment
hilliard
laughed
an
explosive
and
excited
laugh
no
almighty
gladder
than
i
shall
be
to
be
coming
back
again
he
prophesied
but
to
prophesy
is
a
mistake
one
should
leave
the
future
humbly
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
that
night
when
hilliard
was
lying
wakeful
in
his
berth
listening
to
the
click
of
rails
the
old
trapper
lay
under
the
driving
snow
but
he
was
not
wakeful
he
slept
with
no
visions
of
gold
or
love
a
frozen
and
untroubled
sleep
he
had
caught
his
foot
in
a
trap
and
the
blizzard
had
found
him
there
and
had
taken
mercy
on
his
pain
they
did
not
find
his
body
until
spring
and
then
cosme
letter
to
sheila
lay
wet
and
withered
in
his
pocket
chapter
xiii
loneliness
the
first
misery
of
loneliness
takes
the
form
of
a
restless
inability
to
concentrate
it
is
as
if
the
victim
wanted
to
escape
from
himself
after
cosme
departure
sheila
prowled
about
the
silent
cabin
began
this
bit
of
work
and
that
dropped
it
found
herself
staring
vaguely
listening
waiting
and
nervously
shook
herself
into
activity
again
she
tried
to
whistle
but
it
seemed
like
somebody
else
music
and
frightened
her
ears
at
dusk
she
fastened
sacking
across
the
uncurtained
windows
lighted
both
cosme
lamps
bringing
the
second
from
her
bedroom
and
heaped
up
a
dancing
and
jubilant
fire
upon
the
hearth
in
the
midst
of
this
illumination
she
sat
very
stiff
and
still
in
the
angular
chair
and
knitted
her
hands
together
on
her
knee
her
mind
was
now
intensely
active
memories
thoughts
plans
fancies
racing
fast
and
furious
like
screen
pictures
across
her
brain
and
they
seemed
to
describe
themselves
in
loud
whispers
she
had
difficulty
in
keeping
these
voices
from
taking
possession
of
her
tongue
i
do
want
to
talk
to
myself
she
murmured
and
glanced
over
her
shoulder
a
man
has
need
of
his
fellows
for
a
shield
man
is
man
shelter
from
all
the
storm
of
unanswered
questions
where
am
i
what
am
i
why
am
i
no
reply
no
reassuring
double
to
take
away
the
of
self
that
unseen
intangible
aura
of
personality
in
which
each
of
us
moves
as
in
a
cloud
in
the
souls
of
some
there
is
an
man
god
who
will
forever
save
them
from
this
supreme
experience
sheila
religion
vague
conventional
childish
faltered
away
from
her
soul
except
for
her
fire
which
had
a
sort
of
sympathy
of
life
and
warmth
and
motion
she
was
unutterably
alone
and
she
was
beginning
to
suffer
from
the
second
misery
of
solitude
a
sense
of
being
many
personalities
instead
of
one
she
seemed
to
be
entertaining
a
little
crowd
of
confused
and
argumentative
sheilas
to
silence
them
she
fixed
her
mind
on
her
immediate
problem
she
tried
to
draw
hilliard
close
to
her
heart
she
had
an
honest
hunger
for
his
warm
and
graceful
beauty
for
his
young
strength
but
this
natural
hunger
continually
shocked
her
she
tried
not
to
remember
the
smoothness
of
his
neck
as
her
hands
had
slipped
away
from
it
that
afternoon
when
he
raised
her
from
the
snow
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
desire
for
him
was
centered
somewhere
in
her
body
her
mind
remained
cool
detached
critical
even
hostile
she
disliked
the
manner
of
his
wooing
not
that
there
should
have
been
any
insult
to
the
pride
of
a
nameless
little
adventurer
hudson
barmaid
a
waif
in
being
told
that
she
was
a
good
girl
and
fit
to
be
the
mother
of
this
young
children
but
sheila
knew
instinctively
that
these
things
could
not
be
said
could
not
even
be
thought
of
by
such
a
man
as
marcus
arundel
she
remembered
his
words
about
her
mother
sheila
wanted
with
a
great
longing
to
be
loved
like
that
to
be
so
spoken
of
so
exquisitely
entreated
a
phrase
in
hudson
letter
came
to
her
mind
i
handled
you
in
my
heart
like
a
flower
unconsciously
she
pressed
her
hand
against
her
lips
remembered
the
taste
of
whiskey
and
of
blood
if
only
it
had
been
dickie
lips
that
had
first
touched
her
own
blinding
tears
fell
the
memory
of
dickie
comfort
of
dickie
tremulous
restraint
had
a
strange
poignancy
why
was
he
so
different
from
all
the
rest
so
much
more
like
her
father
what
was
there
in
this
pale
little
hotel
clerk
who
drank
too
much
that
lifted
him
out
and
up
into
a
sort
of
radiance
her
memory
of
dickie
was
always
white
the
whiteness
of
that
moonlight
of
their
first
of
that
dawn
of
their
last
meeting
he
had
had
no
chance
in
his
short
unhappy
and
restricted
life
not
half
the
chance
that
young
hilliard
life
had
given
him
to
learn
such
delicate
appreciations
such
tenderness
such
reserves
where
had
he
got
his
delightful
gentle
whimsicalities
that
sweet
impersonal
detachment
that
refused
to
yield
to
stupid
angers
and
disgusts
he
was
like
in
dickie
own
fashion
she
fumbled
for
a
simile
but
there
was
no
word
she
thought
of
a
star
that
morning
star
he
had
drawn
her
over
to
look
at
from
the
window
of
her
perhaps
the
artist
in
sylvester
had
expressed
itself
in
this
son
he
so
despised
perhaps
dickie
was
after
all
hudson
great
work
all
sorts
of
meanings
and
symbols
pelted
sheila
brain
as
she
sat
there
exciting
and
fevering
her
nerves
in
three
days
hilliard
would
be
coming
back
his
warm
youth
would
again
fill
the
house
pour
itself
over
her
heart
after
the
silence
his
voice
would
be
terribly
persuasive
after
the
loneliness
his
eager
golden
eyes
would
be
terribly
compelling
he
was
going
to
fetch
the
parson
sheila
actually
wrung
her
hands
only
three
days
for
this
decision
and
without
a
decision
that
awful
helpless
wandering
those
dangers
those
rash
confidences
of
hers
o
god
where
are
you
why
you
help
me
now
that
was
sheila
prayer
it
gave
her
little
comfort
but
she
did
fall
asleep
from
the
mental
exhaustion
to
which
it
brought
at
least
the
relief
of
expression
when
she
woke
she
found
the
world
a
horrible
confusion
of
storm
it
could
hardly
be
called
morning
a
heavy
flying
darkness
of
drift
a
wind
filled
with
icy
edges
that
stung
the
face
and
cut
the
eyes
a
wind
with
the
voice
of
a
driven
saw
the
little
cabin
was
caught
in
the
whirling
heart
of
a
snow
spout
twenty
feet
high
the
firs
bent
and
groaned
there
is
a
one
of
the
inherited
instinctive
fears
sheila
little
face
looked
out
of
the
whipped
windows
with
a
pinched
and
shrinking
stare
she
went
from
window
to
hearth
looking
and
listening
all
day
a
drift
was
blown
in
under
the
door
and
hardly
melted
for
all
the
blazing
fire
that
night
she
could
go
to
bed
she
wrapped
herself
in
blankets
and
curled
herself
up
in
the
chair
nodding
and
starting
in
the
circle
of
the
firelight
for
three
terrible
days
the
world
was
lost
in
snow
before
the
end
of
that
time
sheila
was
talking
to
herself
and
glad
of
the
sound
of
her
own
hurried
little
voice
then
like
god
came
a
beautiful
stillness
and
the
sun
she
opened
the
door
on
the
fourth
morning
and
saw
above
the
fresh
soft
ascending
dazzle
of
the
drift
a
sky
that
laughed
in
azure
the
green
firs
a
white
and
purple
peak
she
spread
out
her
hands
to
feel
the
sun
and
found
it
warm
she
held
it
like
a
friendly
hand
she
forced
herself
that
day
to
shovel
to
sweep
even
to
eat
perhaps
cosme
would
be
back
before
night
he
and
the
parson
would
have
waited
for
the
storm
to
be
over
before
they
made
their
start
she
believed
in
her
own
excuses
for
five
uneasy
days
and
then
she
believed
in
the
worst
of
all
her
fears
she
had
a
hundred
to
choose
from
cosme
desertion
death
one
day
she
spent
walking
to
and
fro
with
her
nails
driven
into
her
palms
late
that
night
the
white
world
dipped
into
the
still
influence
of
a
full
white
moon
before
hilliard
cabin
the
great
firs
caught
the
light
with
a
deepening
flush
of
green
their
shadows
fell
in
even
lavender
tracery
delicate
and
soft
across
the
snow
across
the
drifted
roof
the
smoke
from
the
chimney
turned
to
a
moving
silver
plume
across
the
blue
of
the
winter
night
sky
intense
and
warm
as
though
it
reflected
an
august
lake
the
door
of
the
cabin
opened
with
a
sharp
thrust
and
sheila
stepped
out
she
walked
quickly
through
the
firs
and
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
open
beyond
and
below
which
began
the
dark
ridge
of
the
primeval
woods
she
stood
perfectly
still
and
lifted
her
face
to
the
sky
for
all
the
blaze
of
the
moon
the
greater
stars
danced
in
radiance
their
constellations
sloped
nobly
across
her
dazzled
vision
she
had
come
very
close
to
madness
and
now
her
brain
was
dumb
and
dark
as
though
it
had
been
shut
into
a
cell
she
stood
with
her
hands
hanging
she
had
no
will
nor
wish
to
pray
the
knowledge
had
come
to
her
that
if
she
went
out
and
looked
this
winter
pan
in
the
face
her
brain
would
snap
either
to
life
or
death
it
would
burst
its
prison
she
stared
through
the
immense
cold
height
of
air
up
at
the
stars
all
at
once
a
door
flew
open
in
her
soul
and
she
knew
god
no
visible
presence
and
yet
an
enveloping
reality
the
god
of
the
savage
earth
of
the
immense
sky
of
the
stars
the
god
unsullied
and
untempted
by
worship
no
god
that
she
had
ever
known
had
ever
dreamed
of
had
ever
prayed
to
before
she
did
not
pray
to
him
now
she
let
her
soul
stand
open
till
it
was
filled
as
were
the
stars
and
the
earth
with
light
the
next
day
sheila
found
her
voice
and
sang
at
her
work
she
gave
herself
an
overwhelming
task
of
cleaning
and
scrubbing
she
was
on
her
knees
like
a
charwoman
sniffing
the
strong
reek
of
suds
when
there
came
a
knocking
at
her
door
she
leapt
up
with
pounding
heart
but
the
knocking
was
more
like
a
scraping
and
it
was
followed
by
a
low
whine
for
a
second
sheila
head
filled
with
a
fog
of
terror
and
then
came
a
homely
little
begging
bark
just
the
throaty
snuffling
sob
of
a
homeless
puppy
sheila
took
cosme
saw
that
it
was
loaded
and
standing
in
the
shelter
of
the
door
she
slowly
opened
it
a
few
moments
later
the
gun
lay
a
yard
away
on
the
soapy
steaming
floor
and
berg
was
held
tight
in
her
arms
his
ecstasy
of
greeting
was
no
greater
than
her
ecstasy
of
welcome
she
cried
and
laughed
and
hugged
and
kissed
him
that
night
after
a
mighty
supper
he
slept
on
her
bed
across
her
feet
two
or
three
times
she
woke
and
reached
her
hand
down
to
caress
his
rough
thick
coat
the
warmth
of
his
body
mounted
from
her
feet
to
her
heart
she
thought
that
he
had
been
sent
to
her
by
that
new
god
as
for
berg
he
had
found
his
god
again
the
taming
touch
of
a
small
human
hand
it
was
in
may
one
morning
in
may
she
had
long
ago
lost
count
of
her
days
when
sheila
stepped
across
her
sill
and
saw
the
ground
just
a
patch
it
was
no
bigger
than
a
tablecloth
but
it
made
her
catch
her
breath
she
knelt
down
and
ran
her
hands
across
it
sifted
some
gravel
through
her
fingers
how
strange
and
various
and
colorful
were
the
atoms
of
stone
rare
as
jewels
to
her
eyes
so
long
used
to
the
white
and
violet
monotony
of
snow
beyond
the
gravel
at
the
very
edge
of
the
drift
a
slender
crescent
of
green
startled
her
eyes
and
yes
there
were
a
dozen
valorous
little
golden
flowers
as
flat
and
round
as
fairy
doubloons
attracted
by
her
cry
berg
came
out
threw
up
his
nose
and
snuffed
spring
spoke
loudly
to
his
nostrils
there
was
sap
rabbits
were
about
all
of
it
no
news
to
him
sheila
sat
down
on
the
sill
and
hugged
him
close
the
sun
was
warm
on
his
back
on
her
hands
on
the
boards
beneath
her
may
may
may
she
whispered
and
up
in
the
firs
quite
suddenly
as
though
he
had
thrown
reserve
to
the
four
winds
a
bluebird
repeated
her
may
may
may
on
three
notes
high
low
and
high
again
a
little
musical
stumble
of
delight
it
had
begun
again
that
of
winter
fear
and
winter
hopelessness
the
birds
sang
and
built
and
the
may
flies
crept
up
through
the
snow
and
spun
silver
in
the
air
for
a
brief
dazzle
of
life
the
sun
was
so
warm
that
berg
and
sheila
dozed
on
their
doorsill
they
did
little
else
these
days
but
dream
and
doze
and
wait
the
snow
melted
from
underneath
sinking
with
audible
groans
of
collapse
and
running
off
across
the
frozen
ground
to
swell
hidden
creek
the
river
roared
into
a
yellow
flood
tripped
its
trees
sliced
at
its
banks
sheila
snowshoed
down
twice
a
day
to
look
at
it
it
was
a
sufficient
barrier
she
thought
between
her
and
the
world
and
now
she
had
attained
to
the
savage
joy
of
loneliness
she
dreaded
change
above
all
she
dreaded
hilliard
that
warmth
of
his
beauty
had
faded
utterly
from
her
senses
it
seemed
as
faint
as
a
fresco
on
a
wall
intrusion
must
bring
anxiety
and
pain
it
might
bring
fear
she
had
had
long
communion
with
her
stars
and
the
god
whose
name
they
signaled
she
with
her
dog
friend
under
her
hand
had
come
to
something
very
like
content
the
roar
of
hidden
creek
swelled
and
swelled
after
the
snow
had
shrunk
into
patches
here
and
there
under
the
pines
and
against
hilly
slopes
there
was
still
the
melting
of
the
mountain
glaciers
nobody
can
possibly
cross
sheila
exulted
a
man
would
have
to
risk
his
life
and
it
was
in
one
of
those
very
moments
of
her
savage
when
there
came
the
sound
of
nearing
hoofs
she
was
sitting
on
her
threshold
watching
the
slow
darkness
a
of
ashes
through
the
still
air
it
was
so
very
still
that
the
little
new
moon
hung
there
above
the
firs
like
faint
music
silver
and
gray
and
silver
and
green
and
violet
sheila
named
the
delicacies
of
dappled
light
the
stars
had
begun
to
shake
little
shivers
of
radiance
through
the
firs
they
were
softer
than
the
winter
stars
their
keenness
melted
by
the
warm
blue
of
the
air
sheila
sat
and
held
her
knees
and
smiled
the
distant
increasing
tumult
of
the
river
so
part
of
the
silence
that
it
seemed
no
sound
at
all
lulled
her
then
above
it
the
beat
of
horse
hoofs
at
first
she
just
sat
empty
of
sensation
except
for
the
shock
of
those
faint
thuds
of
sound
then
her
heart
began
to
beat
to
bursting
with
dread
with
a
suffocation
of
suspense
she
got
up
quiet
as
a
thief
the
horse
stopped
there
came
a
step
rapid
and
eager
she
fled
like
a
furtive
shadow
into
the
house
fell
on
her
knees
there
by
the
hearth
and
hid
her
face
against
the
big
chair
her
eyes
were
full
of
cold
tears
her
were
ice
she
was
shaking
shuddering
rather
from
head
to
foot
the
steps
had
come
close
had
struck
the
threshold
there
they
stopped
after
a
pause
which
her
pulses
filled
with
shaken
rhythm
her
name
was
spoken
so
long
it
had
been
since
she
had
heard
it
that
it
fell
on
her
ear
like
a
foreign
speech
sheila
sheila
she
lifted
her
head
sharply
it
was
not
hilliard
voice
sheila
there
was
such
an
agony
of
fear
in
the
softly
spoken
syllables
there
was
such
a
weight
of
dread
on
the
breath
of
the
speaker
that
for
very
pity
sheila
forgot
herself
she
got
up
from
the
floor
and
moved
dazedly
to
meet
the
figure
on
the
threshold
it
was
dimly
outlined
against
the
violet
evening
light
sheila
came
up
quite
close
and
put
her
hands
on
the
tense
hanging
arms
they
caught
her
then
she
sobbed
and
laughed
aloud
calling
out
in
her
astonishment
again
and
again
softly
incredulously
dickie
oh
dickie
dickie
it
chapter
xiv
sheila
and
the
stars
hilliard
first
messenger
had
been
hindered
by
death
several
times
it
seemed
that
his
second
messenger
would
suffer
the
same
grim
prevention
but
this
second
messenger
was
young
and
set
like
steel
to
his
purpose
he
left
the
railroad
at
millings
hired
a
horse
crossed
the
great
plain
above
the
town
and
braved
the
pass
dangerous
with
overbalanced
weights
of
melting
snow
there
on
the
lonely
hill
he
had
his
first
encounter
with
that
a
caught
him
and
he
left
his
horse
buried
struggling
out
himself
from
the
cold
smother
like
a
maimed
insect
to
lie
for
hours
by
the
road
till
breath
and
life
came
back
to
him
he
got
himself
on
foot
to
the
nearest
ranch
and
there
he
hired
a
fresh
horse
and
reached
rusty
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
rusty
was
overshadowed
by
a
tragedy
the
body
of
the
trapper
first
messenger
had
been
found
under
the
melting
snow
a
few
days
before
and
to
the
young
stranger
was
given
that
stained
and
withered
letter
in
which
hilliard
had
excused
and
explained
his
desertion
nothing
at
rusty
had
been
heard
of
sheila
no
one
knew
even
that
she
had
ever
left
miss
blake
ranch
the
history
of
such
lonely
places
is
a
sealed
book
from
snowfall
until
spring
their
tragedies
are
as
dumb
as
the
tragedies
of
animal
life
no
one
had
ever
connected
sheila
name
with
hilliard
no
one
knew
of
his
plans
for
her
the
trapper
had
set
off
without
delay
not
even
going
back
to
his
house
some
little
distance
outside
of
rusty
to
tell
his
wife
that
he
would
be
bringing
home
a
lodger
with
him
there
was
to
be
sure
at
the
office
a
small
bundle
of
letters
all
in
the
same
hand
addressed
to
miss
arundel
they
had
to
wait
perforce
till
the
country
was
released
it
not
likely
even
now
sly
and
twinkling
lander
of
the
hotel
told
dickie
that
you
can
make
it
to
miss
blake
place
no
sir
nor
to
hilliard
neither
hidden
creek
up
she
sure
some
flood
this
time
of
the
year
it
as
much
as
your
life
good
for
stranger
but
dickie
merely
smiled
and
got
for
himself
a
horse
that
was
good
in
deep
water
and
he
rode
away
from
rusty
without
looking
back
he
rode
along
a
lush
wet
land
of
roaring
streams
and
on
the
bank
of
hidden
creek
there
was
a
roaring
that
drowned
even
the
beating
of
his
heart
the
flood
straddled
across
his
path
like
apollyon
a
dozen
times
the
horse
refused
the
ford
at
last
with
a
desperate
toss
of
his
head
he
made
a
plunge
for
it
almost
at
once
he
was
swept
from
the
cobbled
bed
he
swam
sturdily
but
the
current
whirled
him
down
like
a
straw
dickie
slipped
from
the
saddle
on
the
upper
side
so
that
the
water
pressed
him
close
to
the
horse
and
even
when
they
both
went
under
he
held
to
the
animal
with
hands
like
iron
this
saved
his
life
five
blind
black
gasping
minutes
later
the
horse
pulled
him
up
on
the
farther
bank
and
they
stood
trembling
together
dazed
by
life
and
the
warmth
of
the
air
it
was
growing
dark
the
heavy
shadow
of
the
mountain
fell
across
them
and
across
the
swollen
yellow
river
they
had
just
escaped
there
began
to
be
a
dappling
light
the
faint
shining
of
that
slim
young
moon
she
was
just
a
silver
curl
there
above
the
edge
of
the
hill
in
an
hour
she
would
set
her
brightness
was
as
shy
and
subtle
as
the
brightness
of
a
smile
the
messenger
pulled
his
trembling
body
to
the
wet
saddle
and
looking
about
for
landmarks
that
had
been
described
to
him
he
found
the
faint
trail
to
hilliard
ranch
presently
he
made
out
the
low
building
under
its
firs
he
dropped
down
freed
the
good
swimmer
and
turned
him
loose
then
moved
rapidly
across
the
little
clearing
it
was
all
so
still
hidden
creek
alone
made
a
threatening
tumult
dickie
stopped
before
he
came
to
the
door
he
stood
with
his
hands
clenched
at
his
sides
and
his
chin
lifted
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
to
the
sky
then
he
stumbled
to
the
door
and
called
sheila
she
seemed
to
rise
up
from
the
floor
and
stand
before
him
and
put
her
hands
on
his
arms
a
sort
of
insanity
of
joy
of
childish
excitement
came
upon
sheila
when
she
had
recognized
her
visitor
she
flitted
about
the
room
she
laughed
she
talked
it
had
been
such
a
long
silence
in
broken
ejaculatory
sentences
it
was
dickie
dumbness
as
he
leaned
against
the
door
looking
at
her
that
sobered
her
at
last
she
came
close
to
him
again
and
saw
that
he
was
shivering
and
that
streams
of
water
were
running
from
his
clothes
to
the
floor
why
dickie
how
wet
you
are
again
she
put
her
hands
on
his
arms
he
was
indeed
drenched
she
looked
up
into
his
face
it
was
gray
and
drawn
in
the
uncertain
light
that
dreadful
river
how
did
you
cross
it
dickie
smiled
it
would
have
taken
more
than
a
river
to
stop
me
he
said
in
his
old
fashion
and
that
was
all
sheila
ever
heard
of
that
brief
epic
of
his
journey
he
drew
away
from
her
now
and
went
over
to
the
fire
dickie
she
followed
him
tell
me
how
you
came
here
how
you
knew
where
i
was
wait
i
get
you
some
of
cosme
clothes
and
a
cup
of
tea
this
time
exhausted
as
he
was
dickie
did
not
fail
to
stand
up
to
take
the
cup
she
brought
him
he
shook
his
head
at
the
dry
clothes
he
want
hilliard
things
thank
you
he
was
drying
out
nicely
by
the
fire
he
was
a
bit
cold
he
sat
and
drank
the
tea
leaning
forward
his
elbows
on
his
knees
he
was
after
all
just
the
same
she
decided
only
more
so
his
had
increased
a
hundredfold
there
was
still
that
quaint
look
of
having
come
in
from
the
fairy
doings
of
a
midsummer
night
only
now
that
his
color
had
come
back
and
the
light
of
her
lamp
shone
on
him
he
had
a
firmer
and
more
vital
look
his
sickly
pallor
had
gone
and
the
blue
marks
under
his
eyes
the
eyes
were
fuller
deeper
more
brilliant
he
was
steadier
firmer
he
had
definitely
shed
the
pitifulness
of
his
childhood
and
sheila
did
not
remember
that
his
mouth
had
so
sweet
a
firm
line
from
sensitive
end
to
end
of
the
lips
her
impatience
was
driving
her
heart
faster
at
every
beat
you
please
tell
me
everything
now
dickie
she
pleaded
sitting
on
the
arm
of
hilliard
second
chair
her
cheeks
burned
her
hair
grown
to
an
awkward
length
had
come
loose
from
a
ribbon
and
fallen
about
her
face
and
shoulders
she
had
made
herself
a
frock
of
cotton
stuff
something
that
hilliard
had
bought
for
curtains
it
was
a
startling
color
enough
but
it
could
not
dim
her
gypsy
beauty
of
wild
dark
hair
and
browned
skin
with
which
the
misty
and
spiritual
eyes
and
the
slightly
straightened
and
saddened
lips
made
exquisite
disharmony
dickie
looked
up
at
her
a
minute
he
put
down
his
cup
and
got
to
his
feet
he
went
to
stand
by
the
shelf
from
her
tell
me
at
least
she
begged
in
a
cracked
key
of
suspense
do
you
know
anything
about
at
that
dickie
was
vividly
a
victim
of
remorse
oh
sheila
damn
i
a
beast
of
course
he
all
right
only
you
see
he
been
hurt
and
is
in
the
hospital
that
why
i
came
you
hilliard
dickie
i
ca
really
understand
she
pushed
back
her
hair
with
the
same
gesture
she
had
used
in
the
studio
when
sylvester
hudson
offer
of
a
job
had
set
her
brain
whirling
no
of
course
you
would
dickie
spoke
slowly
again
looking
at
the
rug
i
went
east
but
hilliard
he
looked
up
at
her
and
flashed
a
queer
pained
sort
of
smile
i
am
coming
to
him
sheila
i
got
to
tell
you
about
myself
before
i
get
around
to
him
or
else
you
would
savvy
oh
she
could
meet
the
look
that
went
with
the
queer
smile
for
it
was
even
queerer
and
more
pained
and
was
somehow
too
old
a
look
for
dickie
so
she
said
oh
again
childishly
and
waited
staring
at
her
fingers
i
went
to
new
york
because
i
thought
i
find
you
there
sheila
hotel
was
on
fire
did
you
really
burn
it
down
dickie
he
started
violently
burned
it
down
good
lord
no
what
made
you
think
such
a
thing
never
mind
your
father
thought
so
dickie
face
flushed
i
suppose
he
would
he
thought
it
over
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
did
i
do
know
how
it
started
i
went
to
new
york
and
to
that
place
you
used
to
live
in
the
garret
i
had
the
address
from
the
man
who
took
pap
there
the
studio
studio
there
dickie
yes
i
lived
there
i
thought
at
first
you
might
come
well
dickie
hurried
as
though
he
wanted
to
pass
quickly
over
this
necessary
history
of
his
own
experience
i
got
a
job
at
a
hotel
he
smiled
faintly
i
was
a
waiter
one
night
i
went
to
look
at
a
fire
it
was
a
big
fire
i
was
trying
to
think
out
what
it
was
like
you
know
the
way
i
always
did
it
used
to
drive
pap
loco
i
must
have
been
talking
to
myself
anyway
there
was
a
fellow
standing
near
me
with
a
notebook
and
a
pencil
and
he
spoke
up
suddenly
kind
of
sharp
and
said
that
again
will
you
he
was
a
newspaper
reporter
sheila
that
how
i
got
into
the
job
but
i
only
telling
you
because
sheila
hit
the
rung
of
her
chair
with
an
impatient
foot
oh
dickie
how
silly
you
are
as
if
i
were
to
hear
all
about
it
how
did
you
get
the
job
what
job
reporting
said
dickie
he
was
troubled
by
this
urgency
of
hers
he
began
to
stammer
a
little
of
course
the
the
fellow
helped
me
a
lot
he
got
me
on
the
staff
he
went
round
with
me
he
he
took
down
what
i
said
and
later
he
he
kind
of
edited
my
copy
before
i
handed
it
in
he
he
was
almighty
good
to
me
and
i
i
worked
awfully
hard
like
hell
night
classes
when
i
was
on
night
duty
and
books
then
sheila
i
began
to
get
kind
of
crazy
over
words
his
eyes
kindled
and
his
face
he
straightened
he
forgot
himself
whatever
it
was
that
weighed
upon
him
are
they
wonderful
they
like
polished
stones
each
one
a
different
shape
and
color
and
feel
you
fit
this
way
and
that
and
turn
and
all
at
once
they
shine
and
sing
god
i
never
knowed
what
was
the
matter
with
me
till
i
began
to
work
with
words
and
that
work
sheila
lord
how
you
hate
them
and
love
them
and
curse
them
and
worship
them
i
used
to
think
i
wanted
he
laughed
scorn
at
that
old
desire
then
came
to
again
and
was
shamefaced
i
guess
you
think
i
am
plumb
out
of
my
head
he
apologized
you
see
it
was
because
i
was
a
a
reporter
sheila
that
i
happened
to
be
there
when
hilliard
was
hurt
i
was
coming
home
from
the
night
courts
it
was
downtown
at
a
there
was
a
crowd
somebody
told
me
hilliard
car
ran
into
a
milk
cart
turned
turtle
he
hurt
well
of
course
i
knew
it
be
a
good
story
all
that
about
hilliard
and
his
millions
and
his
coming
from
the
west
to
get
his
inheritance
it
had
just
come
out
a
couple
of
months
before
his
millions
repeated
sheila
she
slipped
off
the
arm
of
her
chair
without
turning
her
wide
look
from
dickie
and
sat
down
with
an
air
of
deliberate
sobriety
his
inheritance
she
repeated
yes
that
what
took
him
east
he
had
news
at
rusty
he
wrote
you
a
letter
and
sent
it
by
a
man
who
was
to
fetch
you
to
rusty
you
were
to
stay
there
with
his
wife
till
hilliard
would
be
coming
back
for
you
but
sheila
the
man
was
caught
in
a
trap
and
buried
by
a
blizzard
they
found
him
only
about
a
week
ago
with
hilliard
letter
in
his
pocket
dickie
fumbled
in
his
own
steaming
coat
here
it
is
i
got
it
do
give
it
to
me
yet
she
said
go
on
well
dickie
turned
the
shriveled
and
stained
paper
lightly
in
restless
fingers
that
morning
in
new
york
i
got
up
close
to
the
car
and
had
my
notebook
out
hilliard
was
waiting
for
the
ambulance
his
ribs
were
smashed
and
his
arm
broken
he
was
conscious
he
was
laughing
and
talking
and
smoking
cigarettes
i
asked
him
some
questions
and
he
took
a
notion
to
question
from
the
west
he
said
and
when
i
told
him
he
kind
of
gasped
and
sat
up
that
turned
him
faint
but
when
they
were
carrying
him
off
he
got
of
my
hand
and
whispered
see
me
at
the
hospital
i
was
willing
enough
i
went
and
they
took
me
to
him
private
room
and
a
nurse
and
flowers
he
has
lots
of
friends
in
new
york
hilliard
you
bet
you
it
was
irony
again
and
sheila
stirred
nervously
that
changed
his
tone
he
moved
abruptly
and
came
and
sat
down
near
her
locking
his
hands
and
bending
his
head
to
study
them
in
the
old
way
he
found
out
who
i
was
and
he
told
me
about
you
sheila
and
because
he
was
too
much
hurt
to
travel
or
even
to
write
he
asked
me
to
go
out
and
carry
a
message
for
him
nothing
would
have
kept
me
from
going
anyway
dickie
added
quaintly
when
i
learned
what
had
been
happening
and
how
you
were
left
and
no
letters
coming
from
rusty
to
answer
his
well
sir
i
could
hardly
sit
still
to
hear
about
all
that
sheila
but
anyway
dickie
moved
his
hands
they
sought
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
the
fingers
tightened
he
looked
past
sheila
he
told
me
then
how
it
was
with
you
and
him
that
you
were
planning
to
be
married
and
i
promised
to
find
you
and
tell
you
what
he
said
what
did
he
say
dickie
spoke
carefully
using
his
strange
gift
with
every
word
his
face
grew
a
trifle
whiter
but
that
had
no
effect
upon
his
eloquence
he
painted
a
vivid
and
touching
picture
of
the
shattered
and
wistful
youth
he
repeated
the
shaken
words
of
remorse
and
love
i
want
her
to
come
east
and
marry
me
i
love
her
tell
her
i
love
her
tell
her
i
can
give
her
everything
she
wants
in
all
the
world
tell
her
to
come
and
far
more
skillfully
than
ever
hilliard
himself
could
have
done
dickie
pleaded
the
intoxication
of
that
sudden
shower
of
gold
the
bewildering
change
in
the
young
waif
life
the
necessity
he
was
under
to
go
and
see
and
touch
the
miracle
there
was
a
long
silence
after
dickie
had
delivered
himself
of
the
burden
of
his
promise
the
fire
leapt
and
crackled
on
hilliard
forsaken
hearth
it
threw
shadows
and
gleams
across
dickie
thin
exhausted
face
and
sheila
inscrutably
thoughtful
one
she
held
out
her
hand
give
me
the
letters
now
dickie
he
handed
her
the
bundle
that
had
accumulated
in
rusty
and
the
little
withered
one
taken
from
the
body
of
the
trapper
sheila
took
them
and
held
them
on
her
knee
she
pressed
both
her
hands
against
her
eyes
then
leaning
toward
the
fire
she
read
the
letters
beginning
with
that
one
that
had
spent
so
many
months
under
the
dumb
snow
berg
who
had
investigated
dickie
leaned
against
her
knee
while
she
read
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
she
read
and
laid
the
pile
by
on
the
table
behind
her
she
sat
for
a
long
while
elbows
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
fingers
laced
beneath
her
chin
she
seemed
to
be
looking
at
the
fire
but
she
was
watching
dickie
through
her
eyelashes
there
was
no
ease
in
his
attitude
he
had
his
arms
folded
his
hands
gripped
the
damp
sleeves
of
his
coat
when
she
spoke
he
jumped
as
though
she
had
fired
a
gun
it
is
not
true
dickie
that
things
were
were
that
way
between
cosme
and
me
we
had
not
settled
to
be
married
she
paused
and
saw
that
he
forced
himself
to
sit
quiet
do
you
really
think
she
said
that
the
man
that
wrote
those
letters
loves
me
dickie
was
silent
he
would
not
meet
her
look
so
you
promised
hilliard
that
you
would
take
me
back
to
marry
him
there
was
an
edge
to
her
voice
dickie
face
burned
cruelly
no
he
said
with
shortness
i
was
going
to
take
you
to
the
train
and
then
come
back
here
i
am
going
to
take
up
this
claim
of
hilliard
he
through
with
it
he
likes
the
east
you
see
sheila
he
got
the
whole
world
to
play
with
it
quite
true
he
said
this
gravely
insistently
he
can
give
you
everything
and
you
dickie
stared
at
her
with
parted
lips
he
seemed
afraid
to
breathe
lest
he
startle
away
some
hesitant
hope
i
he
whispered
i
mean
do
like
the
east
you
will
give
up
your
work
oh
he
dropped
back
the
hope
had
flown
and
he
was
able
to
breathe
again
though
breathing
seemed
to
hurt
yes
i
give
up
newspaper
reporting
i
do
like
new
york
but
dickie
your
words
i
like
to
see
something
you
written
dickie
hand
went
to
an
inner
pocket
i
wanted
you
to
see
this
sheila
his
eyes
were
lowered
to
hide
a
flaming
pride
my
sheila
felt
a
shock
of
dread
dickie
she
was
afraid
to
read
them
she
could
not
help
but
think
of
his
life
at
millings
of
that
sordid
hotel
lobby
newspaper
stories
yes
that
was
imaginable
but
poetry
sheila
had
been
brought
up
on
verse
there
was
hardly
a
beautiful
line
that
had
not
sung
itself
into
the
fabric
of
her
brain
poems
she
repeated
just
a
trifle
blankly
then
seeing
the
hurt
in
his
face
about
the
sensitive
and
delicate
lips
she
put
out
a
quick
penitent
hand
let
me
see
them
at
once
he
handed
a
few
folded
papers
to
her
they
were
damp
he
put
his
face
down
to
his
hands
and
looked
at
the
floor
as
though
he
could
not
bear
to
watch
her
face
sheila
saw
that
he
was
shaking
it
meant
so
much
to
him
then
she
unfolded
the
papers
shrinkingly
and
read
as
she
read
the
blood
rushed
to
her
checks
for
shame
she
ought
never
to
have
doubted
him
never
after
the
first
look
into
his
face
never
after
hearing
him
speak
of
the
cold
white
flame
of
an
unforgotten
winter
night
words
so
greatly
loved
and
groped
for
so
tirelessly
pursued
in
the
face
of
his
world
scorn
and
injury
came
to
him
when
they
did
come
on
wings
in
the
four
short
poems
there
was
not
a
word
outside
of
his
inner
experience
and
yet
she
felt
that
those
words
had
blown
through
him
mysteriously
on
a
wind
the
wind
that
fans
such
flame
oh
little
song
you
sang
to
me
a
hundred
hundred
days
ago
oh
little
song
whose
melody
walks
in
my
heart
and
stumbles
so
i
can
not
bear
the
level
nights
and
all
the
days
are
and
all
the
hours
from
dark
to
dark
turn
to
a
little
song
like
the
beat
of
the
falling
rain
until
there
seems
no
roof
at
all
and
my
heart
is
washed
with
pain
why
is
a
woman
throat
a
bird
white
in
the
thicket
of
the
years
sheila
suddenly
thrust
back
the
leaves
at
him
hid
her
face
and
fell
to
crying
bitterly
dickie
let
fall
his
poems
he
hovered
over
her
utterly
bewildered
utterly
distressed
sheila
could
they
possibly
hurt
you
so
it
was
your
song
your
song
are
you
angry
with
me
i
could
help
it
it
kept
singing
in
me
it
it
hurt
she
thrust
his
hand
away
do
be
kind
to
me
oh
i
am
ashamed
i
treated
you
and
and
snubbed
you
and
and
condescended
to
you
dickie
and
shamed
you
you
and
you
can
write
such
lines
and
you
are
great
you
will
be
very
great
a
poet
dickie
why
could
i
see
father
would
have
seen
touch
me
please
i
ca
bear
it
oh
my
dear
you
must
have
been
through
such
long
long
misery
there
in
millings
behind
that
desk
all
stifled
and
cramped
and
shut
in
and
when
i
came
i
might
have
helped
you
i
might
have
understood
but
i
hurt
you
more
please
do
sheila
it
is
true
oh
my
poems
this
made
her
laugh
a
little
and
she
got
up
and
dried
her
eyes
and
sat
before
him
like
a
humbled
child
it
was
quite
terrible
for
dickie
his
face
was
drawn
with
the
discomfort
of
it
he
moved
about
the
room
miserable
and
restless
sheila
recovered
herself
and
looked
up
at
him
with
a
sort
of
wan
resolution
and
you
will
stay
here
and
work
the
ranch
and
write
dickie
yes
he
managed
a
smile
if
you
think
a
fellow
can
push
a
plough
and
write
poetry
with
the
same
hand
it
been
done
before
and
and
you
will
send
me
back
to
hilliard
and
the
good
old
world
dickie
artificial
smile
left
him
he
stood
white
and
stiff
looking
down
at
her
he
tried
to
speak
and
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
and
i
must
leave
you
here
sheila
went
on
softly
with
my
stars
she
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
door
and
stood
from
him
her
fingers
playing
with
the
latch
dickie
found
part
of
his
voice
what
do
you
mean
sheila
about
your
stars
you
told
me
she
said
carefully
that
you
would
go
and
work
and
then
come
back
but
i
suppose
that
was
as
far
as
she
got
dickie
flung
himself
across
the
room
a
chair
crashed
he
had
his
arms
about
her
he
was
shaking
that
pale
and
tender
light
was
in
his
face
the
whiteness
of
a
full
moon
the
whiteness
of
a
dawn
seemed
to
fall
over
sheila
he
he
can
give
you
everything
dickie
said
shakily
i
been
waiting
she
said
i
did
know
it
until
lately
but
been
waiting
so
long
now
for
for
she
closed
her
eyes
and
lifted
her
soft
sad
mouth
it
was
no
longer
patient
that
night
dickie
and
berg
lay
together
on
the
hide
before
the
fire
wrapped
in
a
blanket
dickie
did
not
sleep
he
looked
through
the
uncurtained
horizontal
window
at
the
stars
you
got
everything
else
hilliard
he
muttered
you
got
the
whole
world
to
play
with
after
all
it
was
your
own
choice
i
told
you
how
it
was
with
me
i
promised
i
play
fair
i
did
play
fair
he
sighed
deeply
and
turned
with
his
head
on
his
arm
and
looked
toward
the
door
of
the
inner
room
it
like
sleeping
just
outside
the
gate
of
heaven
berg
he
said
i
never
thought
i
get
as
close
as
that
he
listened
to
the
roar
of
hidden
creek
it
wo
be
long
old
fellow
before
we
take
her
down
to
rusty
and
bring
her
back
tears
stood
on
then
we
walk
straight
into
heaven
he
played
with
the
dog
rough
mane
she
keep
on
looking
at
the
stars
he
murmured
but
i
keep
on
looking
at
her
but
sheila
having
made
her
choice
had
shut
her
eyes
to
the
world
and
to
the
stars
and
slept
like
a
good
and
happy
child
