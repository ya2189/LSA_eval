house
to

prologue
early
on
a
july
morning
in
constable
brown
was
on
his
beat
in
kensington
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
cathcart
square
cathcart
square
was
an
backwater
of
this
highly
respectable
suburb
it
had
not
been
built
on
any
regular
lines
small
narrow
houses
nestled
comfortably
by
the
side
of
what
might
be
called
mansions
at
the
entrance
to
the
square
itself
a
stood
next
door
to
a
palatial
residence
the
dairy
was
very
old
and
the
square
with
its
strange
agglomeration
of
houses
had
been
built
round
it
constable
brown
a
tall
strapping
young
fellow
took
his
duties
easily
he
was
quite
contented
with
his
lot
and
not
thirsting
for
promotion
he
had
no
overweening
sense
of
his
own
abilities
he
was
friendly
with
all
the
cooks
on
his
beat
and
from
them
he
received
very
choice
in
his
case
the
policeman
lot
was
a
fairly
happy
one
the
morning
was
a
very
bright
one
a
somewhat
powerful
summer
sun
had
just
risen
and
flooded
the
streets
with
light
he
had
no
need
of
his
lantern
early
in
the
morning
as
it
was
he
strolled
slowly
round
the
square
turning
observant
eyes
on
an
the
houses
in
his
patrol
he
met
nobody
the
busy
world
of
commerce
was
not
yet
astir
only
from
afar
he
heard
the
distant
rumbling
of
on
their
way
to
covent
garden
laden
with
fruit
and
vegetables
the
square
was
sleeping
in
a
few
more
hours
it
would
wake
to
vigorous
life
the
dairy
shop
would
take
down
its
shutters
and
show
signs
of
animation
and
when
the
dairy
shop
took
down
its
shutters
constable
brown
would
be
relieved
and
go
home
to
enjoy
his
rest
all
was
quiet
in
the
square
brown
had
patrolled
it
several
times
in
his
nightly
vigil
and
had
discovered
no
signs
of
marauders
he
paused
opposite
no
one
of
the
few
big
houses
he
looked
contemplatively
at
the
board
announcing
in
large
type
this
house
to
let
the
agent
name
displayed
prominently
at
the
foot
of
the
bill
only
house
to
let
in
the
square
ruminated
brown
as
he
stood
reading
the
bill
for
perhaps
the
hundredth
time
it
been
empty
now
for
over
three
months
it
ought
to
have
been
snapped
up
long
ago
he
was
right
houses
in
cathcart
square
did
not
wait
long
for
tenants
brown
ruminated
further
and
provided
his
own
solution
old
miles
the
caretaker
has
got
too
comfortable
quarters
he
want
to
flit
when
people
come
to
view
he
talks
to
them
about
damp
or
ghosts
or
beetles
and
chokes
them
off
artful
old
devil
miles
and
a
bit
too
fond
of
drink
having
finished
his
patrol
of
the
square
itself
he
passed
along
the
backs
abutting
on
a
somewhat
mean
street
for
a
rather
undesirable
neighbourhood
had
built
itself
around
these
somewhat
stately
houses
his
perambulations
brought
him
to
the
back
of
no
the
house
to
let
his
trained
eye
accustomed
to
take
in
the
smallest
details
noticed
a
broken
pane
of
glass
in
the
scullery
window
he
climbed
over
the
low
railing
which
shut
off
the
back
premises
from
the
mean
street
on
which
they
looked
and
peered
at
the
broken
from
a
general
point
of
view
there
was
not
much
in
it
are
broken
every
day
but
this
was
an
empty
house
looked
after
by
a
somewhat
bibulous
caretaker
of
the
name
of
miles
a
hundred
chances
to
one
that
miles
had
stumbled
against
it
and
broken
it
with
his
elbow
but
although
constable
brown
was
not
very
brilliant
he
was
painstaking
and
methodical
his
mind
was
slow
but
tenacious
he
did
not
accept
facts
at
their
face
value
after
peering
through
the
broken
pane
he
proceeded
to
further
experiments
he
lifted
the
window
and
it
went
up
easily
he
drew
his
deductions
swiftly
somebody
had
entered
the
empty
house
that
somebody
had
smashed
the
pane
in
order
to
get
at
the
latch
had
entered
the
house
later
emerged
through
the
window
and
forgotten
to
fasten
it
but
why
enter
an
empty
house
where
there
was
nothing
to
steal
except
the
heavy
furniture
left
by
the
late
tenant
a
washington
who
was
abroad
brown
knew
for
a
fact
from
the
caretaker
that
all
silver
and
plate
had
been
lodged
at
washington
bank
it
was
a
puzzle
one
thing
was
clear
his
duty
lay
straight
before
him
he
must
go
over
that
empty
house
a
careful
examination
might
reveal
something
or
nothing
but
he
was
a
very
cautious
man
and
with
no
great
belief
in
his
own
powers
he
would
not
make
the
examination
alone
he
blew
his
whistle
for
further
assistance
in
a
few
seconds
a
fellow
constable
a
smart
young
fellow
hurried
up
to
him
brown
pointed
to
the
broken
pane
the
uplifted
window
the
smart
young
man
projected
himself
through
the
open
space
brown
followed
explaining
as
he
went
they
searched
the
basement
the
ground
floor
and
the
floor
above
with
no
result
now
for
the
caretaker
said
the
younger
and
the
more
of
the
two
policemen
he
sleeps
up
at
the
top
answered
brown
he
generally
comes
home
over
if
a
regiment
was
hammering
at
the
door
he
would
not
wake
till
his
sleep
was
done
they
went
up
to
the
caretaker
room
on
the
top
floor
the
bed
was
empty
miles
had
evidently
taken
a
holiday
the
young
constable
grunted
seems
a
reliable
sort
of
chap
does
he
i
wonder
how
long
he
has
been
away
the
house
agents
can
tell
us
if
they
have
sent
any
clients
to
view
the
house
during
the
last
hours
and
whether
they
have
been
able
to
get
in
or
not
anyway
for
the
present
he
seems
out
of
this
job
brown
assented
he
did
not
talk
as
much
as
his
colleague
but
his
rather
slow
mind
was
working
at
its
normal
speed
we
got
to
examine
the
other
floors
you
know
i
made
up
my
mind
to
one
thing
whoever
came
in
here
robbery
was
the
object
there
i
quite
agree
remarked
the
younger
man
they
made
their
way
down
from
the
top
floor
which
consisted
of
three
attics
on
the
floor
beneath
this
they
searched
every
room
and
found
nothing
but
on
the
floor
underneath
their
search
was
rewarded
in
a
small
leading
off
the
bedroom
which
fronted
the
square
they
found
a
gruesome
sight
the
lifeless
body
of
a
man
comparatively
young
somewhere
about
or
so
a
deep
gash
in
his
throat
in
his
stiffened
hand
a
razor
the
two
men
gazed
horrified
it
was
an
early
summer
morning
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
windows
the
birds
were
twittering
in
the
trees
shortly
the
whole
world
would
be
astir
and
here
in
the
small
room
lay
the
senseless
clay
oblivious
of
all
these
signs
of
awakening
life
and
vigour
brown
was
the
first
to
speak
suicide
he
said
hoarsely
the
poor
devil
wanted
to
make
an
end
of
it
and
crept
in
here
knowing
it
was
an
empty
house
the
younger
man
spoke
less
convincingly
it
looks
like
it
suicide
as
you
say
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
spoke
slowly
i
think
it
suicide
but
it
might
be
mind
you
i
only
say
might
be
a
very
carefully
planned
murder
and
now
let
us
overhaul
his
pockets
we
may
find
something
to
establish
identification
together
they
bent
down
and
rummaged
the
dead
man
pockets
they
found
plenty
of
material
for
identification
as
they
were
engaged
in
their
gruesome
task
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
being
put
in
the
they
heard
the
door
banged
to
and
heavy
footsteps
ascended
the
staircase
miles
come
back
after
his
spree
whispered
constable
brown
to
the
younger
man
miles
all
unsuspecting
of
what
had
taken
place
during
his
absence
came
heavily
up
the
stairs
it
could
not
be
said
that
he
was
by
any
means
drunk
but
he
was
not
absolutely
sober
he
was
slowly
recovering
from
the
previous
night
debauch
arrived
on
the
floor
where
the
two
policemen
were
conducting
their
investigations
absolute
sobriety
came
back
to
him
he
saw
the
open
door
of
the
two
men
in
uniform
kneeling
by
the
side
of
an
inanimate
object
his
brain
cleared
as
if
by
magic
he
recognised
in
one
of
the
kneeling
constables
his
old
friend
brown
he
indulged
in
a
little
profanity
born
of
his
emotion
which
need
not
be
set
down
here
shorn
of
certain
expletives
natural
to
a
man
of
his
class
he
inquired
of
brown
what
was
the
matter
brown
on
his
side
was
cool
and
explicit
and
instead
of
answering
the
caretaker
questions
he
preferred
to
put
a
few
of
his
own
nice
sort
of
caretaker
you
are
he
said
in
a
contemptuous
voice
you
paid
to
look
after
this
house
are
you
where
were
you
all
last
night
i
should
like
to
know
you
can
see
what
has
happened
somebody
has
got
in
through
the
back
either
to
commit
suicide
or
with
a
companion
who
brought
him
here
to
murder
him
that
got
to
be
found
out
before
the
coroner
miles
pulled
himself
together
he
was
by
no
means
a
fool
when
sober
and
in
sight
of
this
ghastly
object
the
fumes
of
last
night
intoxication
had
absolutely
cleared
i
can
show
an
alibi
right
enough
he
said
doggedly
the
younger
and
of
the
two
constables
looked
up
and
spoke
sharply
so
far
my
friend
we
have
not
accused
you
but
you
may
as
well
tell
us
the
details
of
your
alibi
miles
explanation
delivered
in
the
somewhat
halting
way
of
his
class
bore
the
ring
of
truth
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
whose
name
and
address
he
gave
had
looked
him
up
the
day
before
and
asked
him
to
spend
a
day
with
him
at
shepperton
where
the
said
acquaintance
kept
a
small
shop
miles
had
succumbed
to
the
it
drives
a
man
fair
off
his
blooming
chump
to
be
tied
by
the
leg
in
a
hole
like
this
he
interpolated
in
the
midst
of
his
narrative
waiting
for
tenants
who
never
call
i
daresay
you
chaps
do
your
eight
or
ten
hours
a
day
but
you
out
in
the
open
air
not
looking
on
four
walls
you
see
a
bit
of
life
i
do
constable
brown
cut
across
his
narrative
swiftly
never
mind
your
grievances
miles
if
you
could
get
a
better
job
i
guess
you
would
take
it
where
did
you
spend
the
night
at
the
same
old
show
down
at
shepperton
replied
the
unabashed
miles
my
old
pal
a
sport
i
can
tell
you
when
he
shut
up
his
shop
he
plied
me
with
some
of
the
best
i
was
backward
i
admit
i
missed
the
last
train
back
and
slept
on
the
sofa
in
the
back
room
when
i
woke
i
remembered
things
a
bit
and
got
an
early
train
home
here
i
am
my
old
pal
jack
will
tell
you
i
speaking
gospel
truth
neither
of
the
two
men
listening
to
him
had
any
doubt
that
his
narrative
was
a
true
one
he
was
a
poor
weak
bibulous
creature
but
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
he
be
an
accessory
to
the
gruesome
happenings
at
no
even
had
he
been
at
his
post
as
he
should
have
been
on
this
particular
night
he
would
have
been
sunk
in
a
stertorous
sleep
and
have
heard
nothing
but
to
make
everything
sure
constable
brown
pulled
him
along
and
forced
him
to
look
at
the
dead
man
you
have
never
seen
him
before
miles
i
mean
he
has
not
called
to
look
over
the
house
or
anything
no
miles
looking
shudderingly
at
the
ghastly
sight
was
ready
to
swear
he
had
never
seen
him
before
he
turned
his
frightened
gaze
away
it
will
be
all
over
the
town
he
said
ruefully
we
shall
never
let
the
house
after
this
it
will
still
be
a
soft
job
for
you
miles
retorted
brown
a
little
spitefully
you
wo
have
to
play
up
the
damp
and
the
beetles
you
are
here
for
life
old
man
i
know
said
miles
in
a
gloomy
tone
but
i
shall
see
him
staring
at
me
every
minute
of
the
day
and
night
the
body
was
removed
to
the
mortuary
the
evening
newspapers
had
flaring
headlines
gruesome
discovery
in
no
cathcart
square
an
enterprising
journalist
had
got
hold
of
miles
and
speedily
discovering
his
weakness
had
taken
him
to
the
nearest
and
plied
him
plentifully
with
liquor
with
a
view
to
a
sensational
article
the
enterprising
reporter
made
the
best
of
his
material
but
it
did
not
amount
to
much
the
caretaker
knew
nothing
about
the
dead
man
he
was
armed
at
all
points
with
his
alibi
as
regards
the
house
itself
invested
with
so
much
tragedy
the
present
tenant
was
a
washington
a
man
of
considerable
means
now
abroad
washington
was
prepared
to
let
it
furnished
the
furniture
was
very
valuable
to
a
public
greedily
anxious
for
the
smallest
details
the
astute
journalist
served
up
a
nice
little
article
describing
the
expensive
furniture
and
adding
a
short
of
washington
as
supplied
by
the
reminiscent
miles
the
public
swallowed
this
article
eagerly
and
awaited
further
developments
these
came
with
the
inquest
and
there
was
a
somewhat
tame
ending
to
what
had
promised
to
be
a
very
sensational
case
some
three
months
previously
a
certain
man
named
reginald
davis
had
been
suspected
of
committing
a
murder
while
driving
a
in
cornwall
the
evidence
although
circumstantial
had
been
very
convincing
the
police
had
been
on
his
track
but
not
quickly
enough
the
man
had
eluded
their
vigilance
and
run
to
earth
somewhere
on
the
body
of
the
dead
man
in
cathcart
square
the
two
constables
had
found
three
letters
addressed
to
reginald
davis
also
a
letter
signed
reginald
davis
addressed
to
the
coroner
in
which
he
avowed
his
intention
of
committing
suicide
at
the
earliest
opportunity
it
was
fairly
evident
from
this
that
the
wretched
man
hunted
by
the
police
and
recognising
that
capture
was
imminent
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
had
resolved
upon
the
fatal
step
had
effected
his
entrance
into
the
lonely
house
in
cathcart
square
had
found
it
even
more
deserted
than
he
imagined
and
in
that
little
cheated
the
law
but
in
addition
to
this
overpowering
evidence
there
was
added
the
fact
of
identification
a
tall
handsome
young
woman
giving
the
name
of
caroline
masters
had
been
to
the
mortuary
and
identified
the
body
as
that
of
her
brother
reginald
davis
she
gave
her
evidence
before
the
coroner
with
commendable
composure
broken
now
and
again
with
a
little
natural
grief
her
disclosures
were
briefly
as
follows
reginald
had
always
been
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
not
naturally
vicious
but
impetuous
and
ungovernable
if
he
was
guilty
of
the
murder
in
cornwall
it
had
been
due
to
no
natural
criminal
instinct
but
to
a
fit
of
unbridled
passion
her
theory
was
that
remorse
had
weighed
upon
him
for
this
unpremeditated
crime
and
that
through
remorse
and
the
fear
of
justice
overtaking
him
he
had
crept
into
this
lonely
house
and
passed
sentence
on
himself
she
made
a
very
great
impression
on
the
court
by
the
calm
and
dignified
way
in
which
she
gave
her
evidence
the
coroner
put
to
her
a
few
questions
she
was
quite
certain
that
the
body
was
that
of
her
brother
reginald
davis
were
there
any
other
members
of
the
family
who
could
support
her
in
her
identification
no
there
were
no
other
members
of
the
family
alive
there
was
another
brother
dead
and
a
sister
of
whose
whereabouts
she
knew
nothing
her
father
had
been
a
strange
man
he
had
quarrelled
with
all
the
members
of
his
family
and
she
had
never
known
one
of
them
her
mother
had
died
some
years
ago
her
voice
broke
a
little
as
she
related
these
touching
circumstances
of
her
domestic
life
more
especially
when
she
added
she
was
a
widow
her
husband
having
been
killed
in
the
great
war
there
seemed
but
one
possible
verdict
the
dead
man
it
was
clearly
established
was
reginald
davis
first
by
the
letters
found
upon
him
secondly
by
his
sister
identification
it
was
also
clear
that
reginald
davis
hunted
by
the
police
and
knowing
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
days
or
weeks
before
he
would
be
run
to
earth
had
considered
the
two
alternatives
of
or
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
and
that
he
had
chosen
the
former
the
verdict
was
recorded
masters
was
complimented
on
the
way
in
which
she
had
given
her
evidence
the
coroner
assured
her
that
the
sympathy
of
the
court
was
with
her
the
tears
welled
into
her
eyes
as
she
listened
to
the
coroner
phrases
she
bowed
her
grateful
thanks
constable
brown
was
waiting
in
the
corridor
as
she
came
out
beside
him
stood
the
younger
policeman
who
had
assisted
him
on
that
very
night
in
cathcart
square
brown
touched
his
helmet
a
very
trying
time
for
you
he
said
a
very
trying
time
you
went
through
it
bravely
she
smiled
wanly
my
poor
brother
he
had
so
many
good
points
but
it
is
better
as
it
is
i
shudder
to
think
of
what
might
have
been
if
he
had
not
done
this
dreadful
thing
much
the
best
way
much
the
best
way
corroborated
brown
she
went
out
a
graceful
figure
and
brown
turned
to
his
younger
colleague
a
remarkable
case
old
chap
as
we
said
all
along
suicide
the
younger
man
paused
a
little
before
he
replied
it
may
be
mentioned
that
a
few
months
later
he
was
promoted
to
the
detective
force
in
consequence
of
some
rather
clever
work
connected
with
a
gang
of
coiners
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
west
end
it
looks
like
it
but
i
not
quite
as
sure
as
you
are
he
said
laconically
brown
stared
but
made
no
comment
a
verdict
was
a
verdict
his
young
colleague
had
the
inexperience
and
the
vanity
of
youth
and
thought
he
was
more
clever
than
other
people
perhaps
but
on
one
thing
the
young
constable
had
made
up
his
mind
and
that
was
that
miles
the
bibulous
caretaker
had
not
told
the
truth
when
in
the
he
came
to
this
conclusion
from
his
demeanour
miles
swore
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
dead
man
but
the
constable
believed
this
to
be
a
lie
and
with
the
tame
ending
of
the
coroner
inquest
the
mystery
of
no
cathcart
square
ceased
to
hold
the
public
interest
plenty
of
other
things
came
on
to
attract
their
attention
chapter
i
the
year
before
the
great
war
when
to
all
appearance
there
was
not
a
cloud
upon
the
horizon
when
only
a
few
statesmen
felt
profoundly
uneasy
the
secret
of
that
uneasiness
being
carefully
locked
away
in
their
own
breasts
and
hidden
from
the
general
public
in
that
year
of
in
the
month
of
march
the
lancers
were
quartered
at
the
town
of
blankfield
in
yorkshire
the
was
a
crack
regiment
most
of
the
officers
were
members
of
the
aristocracy
a
few
of
the
plutocracy
that
portion
of
the
plutocracy
which
on
account
of
its
wealth
had
been
adopted
into
a
superior
world
by
marriage
with
its
aristocratic
daughters
they
were
a
fine
set
of
healthy
living
sporting
young
fellows
they
rode
to
hounds
they
played
polo
when
there
was
any
going
they
shot
over
the
coverts
of
their
friends
they
made
love
to
all
the
pretty
girls
they
came
across
in
a
gallant
and
desultory
fashion
loving
and
riding
away
it
can
not
be
said
that
they
took
their
professional
duties
in
too
serious
a
fashion
but
they
were
brave
as
lions
and
when
the
time
came
to
prove
their
mettle
none
of
their
relatives
had
cause
to
blush
for
their
record
the
memories
of
most
of
them
were
enshrined
deeply
in
the
hearts
of
wailing
mothers
and
weeping
sweethearts
when
the
great
holocaust
came
foremost
amongst
this
band
of
gay
spirits
and
resolute
sportsmen
was
a
certain
captain
murchison
hughie
as
he
was
always
called
by
his
intimates
hughie
was
not
a
pure
aristocrat
his
father
a
man
of
fabulous
wealth
was
the
head
of
the
great
brewing
firm
of
murchison
delaroyd
the
fourth
in
succession
for
the
big
brewery
had
been
founded
over
a
hundred
years
ago
it
is
supposed
in
the
case
of
men
that
it
requires
three
generations
to
make
a
gentleman
anyway
the
present
sir
hugh
had
won
his
spurs
by
the
fact
of
belonging
to
the
fourth
and
he
had
further
firmly
established
his
position
by
marrying
lady
gertrude
marchmont
a
daughter
of
the
earl
of
mounthaven
the
marchmonts
had
blue
blood
in
profusion
they
ere
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
the
kingdom
only
just
being
beaten
by
such
superior
people
as
the
howards
the
talbots
and
the
nevilles
captain
murchison
was
therefore
plutocrat
on
the
father
side
aristocrat
of
aristocrat
on
the
mother
but
he
did
not
owe
his
popularity
to
these
adventitious
circumstances
the
fact
that
he
was
the
most
popular
man
in
his
regiment
was
due
to
his
own
sterling
qualities
in
the
first
place
he
was
a
man
of
the
most
unbounded
generosity
and
the
most
serene
he
had
captained
the
eleven
at
eton
and
he
was
one
of
the
best
shots
also
one
of
the
best
in
england
needless
to
say
that
he
was
a
man
man
the
fact
that
he
was
also
equally
a
woman
man
can
be
easily
explained
he
boasted
more
than
ordinary
good
looks
and
he
had
a
charming
deferential
way
with
women
that
captivated
them
at
once
the
had
a
very
good
time
at
blankfield
on
the
whole
the
houses
of
the
county
were
of
course
open
to
such
a
distinguished
regiment
but
perhaps
they
had
a
rather
jollier
time
amongst
the
rather
limited
circle
of
rich
townsfolk
whom
they
condescended
to
visit
the
people
who
at
the
best
had
only
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
the
county
murchison
was
a
born
sportsman
hunting
polo
shooting
cricket
occupied
nearly
all
his
waking
thoughts
except
those
few
that
were
claimed
by
his
professional
duties
popular
as
he
was
with
women
not
a
single
member
of
the
weaker
and
more
charming
sex
had
made
any
real
impression
on
him
up
to
the
present
he
had
had
several
flirtations
with
charming
girls
of
course
he
might
have
indulged
in
a
few
sentimental
passages
with
certain
more
or
less
detached
or
married
women
the
latter
very
rarely
for
although
by
no
means
a
saint
he
was
a
very
young
man
and
held
rather
rigid
notions
as
to
what
might
be
done
and
what
ought
not
to
be
done
anyway
at
this
particular
moment
he
was
quite
and
then
one
day
in
this
rather
sleepy
town
of
blankfield
an
adventure
befell
him
it
was
not
strictly
a
common
or
garden
adventure
for
more
than
one
reason
the
woman
or
rather
girl
who
was
concerned
in
it
for
looking
at
her
in
a
severe
light
she
did
not
appeal
to
be
more
than
twenty
bore
upon
her
no
marks
of
the
shameless
adventuress
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
not
a
member
of
his
own
world
the
world
of
plutocracy
mingled
into
aristocracy
by
judicious
intermarriage
the
county
would
not
of
course
open
their
doors
to
her
according
to
her
own
account
the
respectable
villadom
of
the
sleepy
old
town
had
not
called
upon
her
on
account
of
the
absence
of
convincing
credentials
the
meeting
happened
in
this
way
hugh
found
himself
with
a
blank
afternoon
an
afternoon
that
had
not
been
filled
up
he
could
call
at
lots
of
houses
and
get
tea
but
at
this
period
he
was
becoming
a
little
with
the
blankfield
teas
the
simpering
girls
the
astute
mothers
who
wanted
to
take
the
heir
of
the
murchison
millions
off
his
guard
and
hook
him
for
a
coming
from
a
long
line
of
successful
tradesmen
hugh
had
rather
less
brains
than
he
ought
to
have
acquired
by
heredity
still
he
was
no
fool
as
long
as
a
proposition
was
not
too
complex
he
could
size
it
up
pretty
accurately
and
he
sized
up
the
blankfield
hospitality
at
its
true
worth
he
walked
down
the
high
street
and
turned
into
the
first
it
was
a
establishment
and
the
dashing
members
of
the
were
wont
to
invite
hither
for
tea
some
of
the
blankfield
maidens
who
were
not
too
particular
as
to
chaperonage
he
expected
to
find
here
a
good
few
of
his
brother
officers
to
his
surprise
he
did
not
see
one
but
the
room
was
very
full
to
a
casual
observer
every
table
seemed
occupied
he
was
about
to
turn
away
when
a
waitress
who
knew
him
well
touched
him
on
the
arm
it
quite
all
right
captain
murchison
hugh
had
arrived
at
seniority
very
early
there
a
table
up
there
at
the
far
end
only
a
young
lady
there
and
she
has
very
nearly
finished
her
tea
the
young
lady
in
question
was
quite
young
hugh
decided
from
the
first
swift
glance
at
her
that
she
could
not
be
more
than
twenty
she
was
exceedingly
pretty
with
wavy
light
hair
and
soft
brown
eyes
she
wore
an
air
of
composure
remarkable
in
one
so
youthful
the
young
man
knew
her
well
by
sight
as
did
his
brother
officers
she
was
frequently
to
be
seen
in
the
high
street
flitting
in
and
out
shops
sometimes
alone
sometimes
accompanied
by
a
rather
person
some
ten
years
her
senior
it
was
said
they
were
brother
and
sister
and
their
name
was
burton
they
had
arrived
in
blankfield
about
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
taken
a
moderate
sized
house
on
the
london
road
a
little
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
but
though
they
had
been
here
for
these
two
months
they
knew
nobody
not
a
soul
had
called
upon
them
for
the
villadom
of
blankfield
was
very
select
and
had
to
know
something
about
newcomers
before
it
stretched
out
a
welcoming
hand
about
the
burtons
nothing
seemed
to
be
known
and
until
some
reliable
information
was
forthcoming
they
would
be
ostracised
the
shop
was
very
crowded
and
most
girls
of
her
age
might
have
felt
embarrassed
by
her
loneliness
but
although
many
admiring
glances
were
levelled
at
her
from
the
few
masculine
occupants
she
seemed
quite
unperturbed
and
unconscious
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
but
taking
in
everything
that
was
going
on
under
lowered
eyelids
veiling
those
pretty
brown
eyes
she
gave
him
one
swift
glance
as
he
sat
down
and
then
went
on
composedly
with
her
tea
there
was
nothing
in
the
glance
that
was
either
provocative
or
inviting
of
the
two
hugh
felt
much
more
embarrassed
than
she
did
he
wondered
if
she
was
as
as
she
looked
if
he
addressed
a
remark
to
her
would
she
snub
him
anyway
he
determined
to
put
it
to
the
proof
i
do
hope
i
am
not
intruding
but
it
was
hobson
choice
you
know
this
is
the
only
vacant
table
no
she
was
not
going
to
snub
him
on
the
contrary
she
gave
him
a
very
pleasant
smile
and
he
noted
with
satisfaction
that
her
voice
was
a
refined
and
pleasant
one
there
is
hardly
any
question
of
intruding
in
a
public
place
like
this
i
can
not
expect
them
to
turn
customers
away
in
order
that
i
may
sit
by
myself
it
was
not
a
bad
beginning
thought
hugh
it
was
evident
she
was
not
disinclined
to
enter
into
a
little
desultory
conversation
with
a
man
who
she
knew
was
a
gentleman
and
not
likely
to
take
undue
advantage
of
her
absence
of
conventionality
hugh
went
on
with
growing
boldness
he
had
often
said
to
his
great
chum
jack
pomfret
that
it
was
a
thousand
pities
this
pretty
girl
was
not
in
blankfield
society
she
seemed
so
much
more
attractive
than
the
other
girls
who
were
in
it
we
have
been
introduced
of
course
but
i
know
you
very
well
by
sight
there
is
hardly
a
day
that
i
do
not
meet
you
about
here
and
i
know
your
name
too
you
are
miss
burton
are
you
not
and
you
live
with
your
brother
at
that
nice
little
house
on
the
london
road
quite
right
miss
burton
nodded
her
pretty
head
she
added
with
a
little
silvery
laugh
we
ca
be
introduced
unless
the
waitress
took
the
kind
office
upon
herself
for
i
do
know
a
soul
in
the
place
we
have
been
here
two
months
and
we
have
been
let
severely
alone
i
suppose
if
we
stayed
here
for
twenty
years
it
would
be
the
same
of
course
we
did
expect
to
get
into
society
but
we
must
be
quite
as
good
as
heaps
of
people
in
the
town
and
outskirts
hugh
was
a
little
embarrassed
by
these
very
frank
remarks
he
observed
lamely
that
it
was
a
shame
and
indulged
in
some
rather
inane
remarks
on
the
snobbishness
of
provincial
towns
you
must
find
it
awfully
dull
he
ventured
after
a
brief
pause
during
the
short
silence
miss
burton
had
ordered
herself
some
more
tea
it
was
evident
that
she
was
not
desirous
of
abruptly
terminating
this
pleasant
the
waitress
drew
her
own
conclusions
from
the
further
order
and
smiled
a
little
as
she
turned
away
i
should
be
a
hypocrite
if
i
pretended
the
contrary
of
course
housekeeping
takes
up
a
good
bit
of
my
time
and
i
read
a
good
deal
and
do
a
lot
of
but
all
the
same
it
is
a
state
of
isolation
not
an
outside
person
to
speak
to
from
one
to
the
other
of
course
i
hear
all
that
is
going
on
from
the
tradespeople
and
i
know
the
names
of
the
principal
persons
here
whom
i
constantly
meet
and
never
speak
to
i
know
for
instance
that
you
are
captain
murchison
i
think
i
know
the
names
of
all
your
brother
officers
what
made
you
come
here
if
it
is
not
a
rude
question
asked
hugh
bluntly
it
was
surely
a
risky
experiment
landing
yourself
in
a
town
like
this
without
any
introductions
i
told
my
brother
so
when
he
first
proposed
it
replied
miss
burton
calmly
but
although
he
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
he
is
frightfully
obstinate
he
had
stayed
at
an
hotel
here
for
a
few
days
some
years
ago
and
he
had
taken
a
violent
fancy
to
the
place
he
was
quite
sure
everybody
would
make
a
rush
for
us
the
moment
we
arrived
miss
burton
proceeded
to
draw
on
her
gloves
during
this
explanatory
conversation
she
had
consumed
her
second
cup
of
tea
she
called
the
waitress
and
paid
her
bill
i
must
be
going
now
she
said
i
have
quite
enjoyed
this
little
chat
although
i
am
sure
you
will
think
very
badly
of
me
for
having
confided
so
much
to
a
stranger
i
really
do
know
what
made
me
do
it
i
suppose
i
got
tired
of
having
kept
silence
for
so
long
yes
he
could
understand
that
poor
pretty
little
girl
just
at
an
age
when
all
the
pleasures
of
youth
should
be
open
to
her
and
to
have
to
pass
her
life
in
the
society
of
that
rather
brother
good
fellow
as
she
declared
him
to
be
i
have
enjoyed
the
meeting
immensely
too
said
hugh
heartily
i
only
wish
we
could
come
across
each
other
at
some
of
these
blankfield
houses
stupid
and
dull
as
they
generally
are
and
then
the
pretty
miss
burton
fired
her
last
shot
as
she
rose
to
leave
i
have
been
unconventional
enough
from
the
beginning
and
if
i
can
do
it
without
blushing
i
am
going
to
be
more
unconventional
still
if
you
cared
to
come
up
to
rosemount
one
afternoon
i
am
sure
my
brother
would
be
pleased
to
see
you
murchison
was
very
embarrassed
by
the
suggestion
although
she
did
not
proffer
it
in
any
bold
fashion
i
shall
be
delighted
he
stammered
i
will
run
up
one
afternoon
of
course
when
he
said
this
he
had
very
little
intention
of
keeping
his
promise
to
enjoy
a
mild
sort
of
flirtation
with
an
exceedingly
pretty
girl
was
one
thing
to
go
to
her
house
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
her
brother
who
he
was
certain
was
not
a
gentleman
was
quite
a
different
proposition
and
might
land
him
in
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
complications
he
also
had
an
uneasy
conviction
that
miss
burton
was
remarkably
for
such
a
young
woman
she
had
spoken
of
blushing
when
she
gave
him
the
invitation
but
she
had
not
done
so
not
the
faintest
colour
showed
on
her
cheek
and
the
glance
that
met
his
was
perfectly
steady
and
unwavering
she
must
either
be
very
innocent
or
young
as
she
was
she
had
acquired
the
experience
and
of
a
much
older
woman
he
would
like
to
think
it
all
out
the
girl
nodded
in
a
friendly
fashion
and
tripped
away
leaving
hugh
murchison
to
finish
his
tea
and
ponder
over
what
had
happened
chapter
ii
hugh
got
back
to
his
quarters
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
hunt
up
his
great
friend
jack
pomfret
he
found
that
young
gentleman
stretched
in
front
of
a
blazing
fire
ft
was
a
very
chilly
march
and
smoking
a
cigar
nearly
as
big
as
himself
jack
pomfret
it
may
be
said
was
quite
a
small
man
of
about
the
size
and
weight
that
would
be
associated
with
the
coxswain
of
a
boat
next
to
murchison
perhaps
pomfret
was
the
most
popular
man
in
the
regiment
he
was
certainly
the
poorest
for
although
he
came
of
an
aristocratic
family
the
said
family
had
very
little
to
bless
themselves
with
if
it
had
been
left
to
his
immediate
relatives
jack
would
have
had
to
enter
a
line
regiment
and
subsist
on
his
pay
supplemented
by
more
or
less
regular
small
remittances
from
his
father
but
fortune
had
smiled
on
jack
when
he
was
in
his
cradle
a
rich
had
been
his
godmother
and
from
the
date
of
his
christening
had
taken
him
under
her
wing
she
had
been
crossed
in
love
when
quite
a
girl
would
never
marry
jack
pomfret
had
a
handsome
but
not
an
extravagant
allowance
now
and
he
would
come
into
his
fortune
when
she
died
jack
always
complained
that
his
aunt
was
a
bit
thrifty
and
did
not
fully
understand
the
imperative
necessities
of
a
young
subaltern
in
an
expensive
regiment
like
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
miss
harding
his
mother
youngest
sister
suffered
from
acute
indigestion
existed
principally
on
and
biscuits
lived
in
a
comparatively
small
house
with
one
manservant
and
two
maids
and
saved
a
great
deal
every
year
out
of
a
large
income
she
loved
jack
very
much
but
she
had
little
or
no
sympathy
with
the
follies
and
indiscretions
of
youth
she
had
a
hazy
sort
of
idea
that
an
officer
should
live
within
his
pay
as
she
lived
well
within
her
income
needless
to
say
that
jack
had
long
disabused
her
of
this
silly
idea
great
tidings
old
man
cried
murchison
breaking
in
upon
the
meditative
little
man
blowing
great
clouds
of
smoke
i
give
you
six
guesses
not
in
a
guessing
mood
returned
jack
shortly
all
my
is
used
up
i
am
trying
to
concoct
a
letter
to
the
dear
old
aunt
god
bless
her
she
is
one
of
the
best
insinuating
gently
that
a
cheque
for
a
couple
of
hundred
would
be
very
convenient
at
the
present
moment
murchison
took
a
seat
silly
old
ass
he
said
in
a
kindly
tone
if
you
want
a
couple
of
hundred
have
it
from
me
and
do
worry
about
the
aunt
you
can
pay
me
when
she
from
what
you
have
told
me
about
your
respected
relative
it
might
be
a
lengthy
business
i
suppose
you
will
plead
debts
she
might
offer
to
discharge
them
and
ask
the
names
of
the
creditors
in
that
case
old
chap
you
would
handle
much
personally
would
you
pomfret
laughed
genially
he
was
always
very
but
he
was
never
depressed
for
very
long
there
was
always
a
silver
lining
to
every
cloud
she
the
sweetest
dearest
soul
on
god
earth
he
said
in
a
tone
of
conviction
but
you
know
hughie
old
man
she
does
understand
i
say
emphatically
she
does
understand
you
know
what
i
mean
she
is
early
victorian
as
to
your
suggestion
i
appreciate
it
very
much
but
emphatically
no
he
added
with
a
whimsical
smile
yours
is
a
loan
i
should
have
to
pay
back
heaven
knows
when
i
could
do
so
the
dear
old
aunt
well
it
is
a
gift
no
question
of
paying
back
i
have
thought
it
all
out
yet
but
in
the
early
cool
of
morning
i
shall
write
her
a
beautiful
and
touching
letter
i
know
by
experience
it
will
bring
a
cheque
you
an
artful
young
devil
i
know
said
murchison
straight
as
a
die
himself
he
was
not
too
appreciative
of
his
friend
diplomatic
methods
on
the
other
hand
was
he
justified
in
criticising
he
had
a
magnificent
allowance
from
his
opulent
father
poor
jack
with
a
somewhat
puritanical
and
niggardly
aunt
at
his
back
had
just
to
worry
along
and
live
in
this
expensive
regiment
from
hand
to
mouth
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
on
this
subject
well
jack
are
you
in
a
mood
to
listen
to
my
news
pomfret
leaned
forward
and
flicked
the
ash
oft
his
cigar
yes
i
think
i
am
begone
dull
care
i
shall
write
that
letter
the
first
thing
morning
well
i
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
that
pretty
burton
girl
whom
nobody
in
blankfield
visits
pomfret
emitted
a
little
chuckling
sound
lucky
devil
how
did
you
do
it
i
thought
she
was
unapproachable
she
walks
down
the
high
street
a
haughty
stare
and
her
nose
in
the
air
and
looks
neither
to
left
nor
right
how
did
you
manage
it
old
man
hugh
laughed
oh
as
easy
as
anything
just
dropped
in
to
winkley
expecting
to
see
a
lot
of
you
fellows
with
your
best
girls
not
a
soul
there
i
knew
room
full
every
table
full
save
for
one
at
which
miss
burton
was
sitting
alone
sat
at
the
one
table
with
miss
burton
there
it
is
in
a
nutshell
pomfret
grinned
broadly
oh
hughie
what
i
would
have
given
for
your
chance
you
know
i
am
awfully
gone
on
that
girl
she
is
so
sweet
and
dainty
far
and
away
the
prettiest
girl
in
blankfield
what
did
you
make
of
your
chance
as
much
as
could
be
made
in
five
or
ten
minutes
she
told
me
a
lot
about
things
her
disappointment
in
finding
that
the
blankfield
people
would
not
call
upon
her
and
that
excepting
her
brother
she
had
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
poor
little
soul
said
pomfret
in
a
voice
of
the
deepest
sympathy
poor
little
soul
he
repeated
well
we
talked
for
some
little
time
some
ten
minutes
perhaps
i
think
it
could
have
been
much
longer
and
then
then
you
will
never
believe
it
jack
she
asked
me
to
call
and
be
introduced
to
her
brother
pomfret
was
quite
young
in
fact
he
was
the
baby
of
the
regiment
but
having
been
educated
at
a
public
school
he
had
learned
a
certain
amount
of
worldly
wisdom
rather
early
he
gave
expression
to
it
now
if
she
were
living
with
her
mother
or
a
maiden
aunt
hughie
the
thing
would
be
so
easy
but
the
brother
we
have
seen
him
walking
beside
that
lovely
girl
it
would
be
difficult
to
class
him
it
would
be
perhaps
too
much
to
say
he
was
either
a
bounder
or
a
cad
he
not
boisterous
enough
for
the
one
or
common
enough
for
the
other
but
clearly
he
not
a
gentleman
or
the
imitation
of
one
no
answered
hugh
your
description
of
the
brother
quite
fits
he
is
neither
fish
flesh
fowl
nor
good
as
the
old
saw
has
it
then
the
girl
is
so
different
she
is
to
an
extent
frank
and
unconventional
she
must
be
or
she
would
have
asked
you
to
call
upon
her
interrupted
the
astute
pomfret
quite
so
i
perfectly
agree
but
upon
my
soul
jack
she
has
the
most
perfect
manners
she
does
these
sort
of
things
in
such
a
way
that
you
cease
to
wonder
why
she
does
them
i
understand
pomfret
looked
very
wise
there
a
wonderful
fascination
about
the
girl
she
radiates
it
even
when
you
pass
her
in
the
street
by
gad
there
not
a
young
woman
in
blankfield
who
can
hold
a
candle
to
her
well
hughie
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
invitation
i
in
two
minds
old
man
to
go
or
stay
away
there
the
brother
you
see
there
the
brother
repeated
pomfret
and
a
dashed
disappointing
sort
of
a
brother
too
if
it
had
only
been
a
mother
or
a
maiden
aunt
what
a
priceless
opportunity
and
yet
it
seems
a
bit
too
good
to
be
lost
but
the
brother
what
about
him
hugh
insisted
the
brother
is
of
course
a
you
ca
ask
him
to
mess
fireworks
will
stand
more
from
you
than
anybody
but
he
would
never
stand
burton
he
would
be
calling
him
grace
or
worship
or
something
old
fireworks
it
may
be
explained
was
the
nickname
of
the
respected
colonel
of
the
gallant
lancers
it
had
been
conferred
upon
him
on
account
of
his
explosive
temper
he
was
also
a
rigid
disciplinarian
i
shall
not
go
said
hugh
after
a
brief
pause
pomfret
was
thinking
deeply
he
pulled
at
his
big
cigar
in
a
meditative
fashion
then
at
length
out
of
his
wisdom
he
spoke
let
us
reason
this
out
my
friend
a
very
pretty
girl
asks
you
to
go
and
see
her
she
is
unfortunately
hampered
by
an
undesirable
brother
you
accept
their
hospitality
but
you
know
he
is
not
a
man
you
can
ask
to
mess
but
you
can
take
him
to
an
hotel
and
feed
him
up
there
tell
him
the
colonel
kicked
up
rough
about
guests
any
lie
you
like
to
save
his
a
good
idea
jack
have
you
anything
more
to
say
do
forget
that
if
i
go
to
rosemount
the
news
will
be
all
over
blankfield
in
five
minutes
pomfret
snapped
his
fingers
who
cares
a
fig
for
the
blankfield
people
everybody
knows
or
ought
to
know
that
a
soldier
loves
and
rides
away
and
the
blankfield
girls
are
dull
enough
heaven
knows
i
would
give
a
thought
to
them
then
you
advise
me
to
call
and
be
introduced
to
the
brother
eh
of
course
we
shall
be
off
in
another
two
months
and
leave
only
tender
memories
behind
us
pomfret
was
a
practical
person
if
ever
there
was
one
let
us
seize
the
passing
day
by
the
way
have
you
any
objection
to
taking
me
up
to
call
with
you
when
you
go
say
no
if
you
have
the
slightest
objection
hugh
murchison
looked
at
him
squarely
no
old
chap
not
the
slightest
the
girl
interests
me
in
a
way
chiefly
i
think
because
i
quite
make
her
out
ca
determine
whether
she
is
very
cunning
or
very
simple
but
i
am
not
attracted
in
the
ordinary
sense
i
take
it
you
are
pomfret
look
of
indifference
changed
to
one
of
gravity
yes
hughie
i
am
i
would
like
to
see
that
girl
at
close
quarters
hugh
rose
right
we
will
call
together
and
in
the
meantime
we
will
keep
it
from
the
other
fellows
good
heavens
i
should
think
so
we
should
be
chaffed
to
death
was
jack
fervent
answer
a
few
days
later
the
two
young
men
walked
to
rosemount
it
was
a
villa
sort
of
house
set
in
a
small
garden
very
carefully
kept
the
windows
were
ornamented
with
boxes
of
flowers
small
as
the
establishment
was
there
was
an
air
of
elegance
about
it
an
elegance
perhaps
of
restricted
means
but
of
refined
taste
pomfret
nudged
his
senior
officer
i
say
they
turned
it
into
a
very
decent
sort
of
little
crib
have
they
i
should
say
that
is
due
to
the
girl
hugh
laughed
perhaps
it
is
the
brother
after
all
he
might
be
an
artist
you
know
artists
are
often
very
chaps
artist
be
hanged
said
pomfret
emphatically
i
bet
you
a
fiver
he
is
an
artist
whatever
he
is
a
or
a
tout
more
likely
at
the
end
of
this
short
colloquy
they
had
reached
the
hall
door
a
very
smart
maidservant
in
a
becoming
cap
and
apron
opened
it
in
answer
to
their
inquiry
miss
burton
was
in
they
were
shown
into
the
the
young
mistress
of
the
house
was
reclining
in
an
an
open
book
lay
on
her
lap
she
advanced
towards
them
with
that
peculiar
air
of
which
had
so
impressed
hugh
on
his
first
meeting
in
the
a
hostess
with
years
of
social
experience
could
not
have
been
more
at
her
ease
than
this
young
girl
how
nice
of
you
to
come
after
that
very
vague
invitation
she
said
in
her
clear
silvery
voice
she
addressed
murchison
first
and
then
turned
swiftly
to
pomfret
in
whose
eyes
she
doubtless
recognised
frank
admiration
of
her
peculiar
attractiveness
i
know
your
friend
is
going
to
introduce
you
in
proper
form
but
it
is
really
quite
unnecessary
i
know
you
are
pomfret
i
have
learned
the
names
of
all
the
officers
from
the
tradespeople
also
my
only
friends
in
blankfield
perhaps
captain
murchison
has
told
you
what
i
confided
to
him
the
other
day
that
we
are
as
isolated
here
as
if
we
were
on
a
desert
island
pomfret
sat
down
beside
her
on
a
small
chesterfield
from
his
vantage
point
he
could
gaze
into
the
beautiful
eyes
he
could
note
the
lustre
of
that
fair
wavy
hair
a
beastly
shame
growled
the
young
subaltern
at
a
loss
for
appropriate
words
to
express
the
enormities
of
blankfield
society
she
turned
away
lightly
as
if
the
subject
interested
her
no
further
i
think
we
will
have
tea
my
brother
is
engaged
in
scientific
pursuits
when
he
can
tear
himself
away
he
will
join
us
captain
murchison
will
you
kindly
ring
the
bell
truly
she
had
the
manners
of
a
woman
of
the
world
she
took
the
homage
of
the
two
men
as
an
accomplished
fact
the
villadom
of
blankfield
could
not
produce
such
a
hostess
so
free
from
fussiness
or
exaggerated
hospitality
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
county
to
find
her
parallel
the
two
men
exchanged
appreciative
glances
whatever
her
origin
miss
burton
could
shine
in
any
circle
in
which
she
found
herself
permanently
or
temporarily
located
the
tea
was
served
and
over
the
they
chatted
in
desultory
fashion
then
the
door
opened
and
burton
appeared
from
the
moment
of
his
appearance
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
be
changed
he
advanced
towards
them
with
outstretched
hands
his
manner
was
extremely
cordial
but
it
went
beyond
the
limits
of
good
taste
his
tones
were
breezy
but
blusterous
there
was
a
rasping
and
a
vulgar
ring
in
his
voice
welcome
to
our
humble
abode
gentlemen
it
is
very
brave
of
you
to
come
and
visit
the
boycotted
ones
hugh
and
jack
pomfret
fidgeted
in
their
chairs
this
young
man
was
a
bit
too
communicative
about
his
private
affairs
they
had
a
slight
suspicion
that
he
had
been
indulging
in
alcohol
his
manner
was
so
unrestrained
burton
sank
down
in
his
chair
and
took
a
cup
of
tea
from
the
hands
of
his
attentive
sister
the
visitors
did
not
see
it
but
she
shot
a
warning
glance
at
him
and
in
face
of
that
warning
glance
burton
by
a
strong
effort
pulled
himself
together
you
see
gentlemen
i
feel
very
sore
about
this
matter
my
sister
has
a
calmer
temperament
and
she
takes
things
as
they
come
here
we
came
from
the
north
of
ireland
from
a
little
town
where
we
were
highly
looked
up
to
where
we
knew
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
place
we
came
here
and
as
i
say
we
are
boycotted
miss
burton
looked
at
him
severely
george
i
do
not
think
it
is
very
good
taste
of
you
to
inflict
your
grievances
upon
these
gentlemen
who
have
just
come
to
make
an
afternoon
call
do
you
think
you
could
soothe
your
nerves
better
by
getting
back
to
your
laboratory
or
whatever
you
call
it
burton
accepted
the
hint
and
rose
he
waved
a
genial
hand
towards
the
visitors
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
few
moments
i
have
a
most
important
experiment
on
but
i
shall
be
back
very
shortly
i
shall
see
you
again
before
you
leave
the
two
young
men
devoutly
wished
that
they
might
not
see
him
again
the
man
was
a
confirmed
and
innate
vulgarian
both
he
and
his
sister
no
doubt
felt
very
sore
about
their
social
ostracism
but
how
different
were
the
methods
of
expression
indulged
in
by
the
two
she
explained
the
situation
with
a
proud
dignity
hiding
her
chagrin
with
a
show
of
indifference
he
was
exposing
his
gaping
wounds
to
the
public
eye
with
an
air
of
ostentation
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
my
brother
said
miss
burton
when
her
ebullient
relative
had
left
the
room
he
has
the
true
irish
temperament
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
conceal
his
feelings
he
would
like
to
go
down
the
high
street
trailing
his
coat
behind
him
and
inviting
the
residents
to
tread
upon
it
in
real
irish
fashion
so
that
he
could
indulge
in
a
free
fight
with
them
the
young
men
laughed
cordially
they
felt
that
a
somewhat
awkward
situation
had
been
saved
by
her
ready
tact
her
rather
humorous
explanation
but
murchison
the
more
of
the
two
looked
at
her
very
fixedly
as
he
said
but
you
are
irish
too
how
is
it
that
you
have
learned
to
control
your
feelings
so
successfully
at
such
a
direct
question
he
would
have
expected
her
to
flush
a
little
at
any
rate
show
some
slight
symptoms
of
embarrassment
but
this
remarkably
girl
of
twenty
or
thereabouts
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
she
laughed
her
little
silvery
laugh
my
brother
and
i
are
as
wide
apart
as
the
north
and
south
poles
she
said
lightly
many
people
have
commented
on
the
fact
would
you
like
to
know
the
reason
she
directed
a
rather
challenging
glance
in
the
direction
of
pomfret
whom
she
rightly
judged
to
be
more
susceptible
to
feminine
influence
than
his
friend
i
should
like
to
very
much
was
the
subaltern
answer
that
eloquent
glance
had
completely
subjugated
the
young
man
well
listen
my
father
was
a
gambling
irish
squire
who
squandered
his
money
and
left
little
but
debts
behind
him
my
brother
takes
after
him
in
certain
qualities
thank
heaven
not
his
least
desirables
ones
my
mother
was
an
englishwoman
rather
a
puritanical
sort
of
woman
who
fell
in
love
perhaps
a
little
injudiciously
and
i
think
wore
her
life
out
in
the
attempt
to
curb
my
father
unhappy
propensities
i
take
after
my
mother
you
understand
george
is
really
my
by
my
father
first
wife
pomfret
nodded
his
head
gravely
i
quite
understand
he
said
and
his
tone
was
one
of
conviction
murchison
preserved
a
benevolent
attitude
of
neutrality
he
was
still
thinking
it
all
out
miss
burton
was
very
pretty
nay
more
than
pretty
very
charming
very
attractive
gifted
with
a
marvellous
very
clever
very
adroit
but
was
she
as
genuine
and
frank
as
she
seemed
pomfret
evidently
thought
so
but
murchison
was
not
quite
sure
george
burton
who
took
after
his
irish
father
in
several
respects
according
to
his
sister
account
made
a
before
the
visitors
left
there
had
been
just
a
little
suspicion
at
first
that
he
had
been
indulging
in
the
habits
of
his
male
parent
if
so
that
suspicion
must
be
at
once
removed
he
was
bright
breezy
and
blusterous
but
he
was
certainly
master
of
himself
he
advanced
with
the
most
cordial
air
gentlemen
i
feel
i
owe
you
an
apology
i
had
no
right
to
intrude
my
private
grievances
upon
you
even
although
i
am
very
possessed
with
them
please
put
it
down
to
my
irish
temperament
you
will
forgive
me
i
am
sure
he
stretched
out
appealing
hands
the
hands
of
the
plebeian
as
murchison
was
quick
to
notice
nails
bitten
to
the
quick
coarse
fingers
and
thumbs
murchison
quietly
ignored
the
outstretched
hand
so
did
pomfret
subjugated
as
he
was
with
the
charm
and
attractiveness
of
miss
burton
he
did
not
quite
feel
that
he
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
this
very
terrible
brother
who
took
after
his
irish
father
i
apologise
most
sincerely
gentlemen
he
repeated
for
my
outburst
just
now
i
had
no
right
to
inflict
upon
you
a
recital
of
my
private
grievances
against
the
inhabitants
of
this
wretched
town
but
i
am
a
wild
excitable
irishman
whatever
is
in
my
mind
has
to
come
out
please
forgive
me
i
know
my
sister
norah
never
will
he
looked
appealingly
at
the
girl
who
sat
there
calm
and
as
always
with
a
slight
expression
of
contempt
upon
her
charming
face
i
have
already
made
excuses
for
you
to
captain
murchison
and
pomfret
she
said
coldly
the
visitors
were
very
much
embarrassed
what
could
they
say
to
this
dreadful
person
who
seemed
so
utterly
lacking
in
all
the
qualities
of
good
breeding
hugh
remained
silent
pomfret
opened
his
lips
and
murmured
something
about
the
whole
affair
being
very
regrettable
but
these
somewhat
incoherent
remarks
were
quite
enough
to
restore
burton
to
his
normal
state
of
easy
buoyancy
he
smiled
affably
so
that
is
all
over
well
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
and
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
your
first
visit
is
your
last
now
i
propose
you
come
round
and
have
a
little
bit
of
dinner
with
us
soon
so
that
we
may
get
to
know
each
other
better
any
night
that
you
are
at
liberty
will
suit
us
are
not
overwhelmed
with
invitations
as
you
can
understand
from
what
i
have
told
you
if
murchison
had
been
by
himself
he
would
have
politely
shelved
the
invitation
miss
burton
who
took
after
her
english
mother
was
quite
decent
and
ladylike
the
brother
was
insufferable
vulgarity
so
to
speak
oozed
from
him
he
was
offensive
even
in
his
geniality
in
short
he
was
impossible
but
pomfret
took
the
wind
out
of
his
senior
sails
sorry
we
are
quite
full
up
this
week
but
hardly
anything
on
next
shall
we
say
monday
miss
burton
took
the
matter
out
of
her
brother
hands
by
turning
directly
to
murchison
monday
of
course
will
suit
us
will
it
suit
you
she
asked
him
pointedly
taken
by
surprise
the
unhappy
young
man
could
only
mutter
a
reluctant
affirmative
a
few
minutes
later
they
left
pledged
to
partake
of
the
burtons
hospitality
on
the
following
monday
when
they
were
safely
outside
murchison
spoke
severely
to
his
brother
officer
you
let
us
in
for
a
nice
thing
if
you
had
left
it
to
me
i
would
have
got
out
of
that
dinner
somehow
but
i
did
want
to
get
out
of
it
replied
the
unabashed
junior
we
knew
the
brother
was
pretty
bad
all
along
i
do
know
that
on
the
whole
he
is
much
worse
than
we
imagined
but
she
a
ripping
girl
i
want
to
see
more
of
her
you
silly
young
ass
growled
murchison
i
believe
you
fallen
head
over
ears
in
love
with
her
and
pomfret
one
of
the
most
mercurial
and
of
subalterns
answered
quite
gravely
i
rather
fancy
i
have
i
never
met
a
girl
who
appealed
to
me
in
quite
the
same
sort
of
way
chapter
iii
a
result
of
his
visit
to
rosemount
hugh
murchison
was
very
perturbed
in
his
mind
he
blamed
himself
severely
for
having
been
tempted
into
that
rather
intimate
conversation
at
the
miss
burton
was
attractive
enough
and
enough
to
excuse
any
man
for
taking
advantage
of
his
obvious
opportunities
but
he
had
been
a
fool
to
go
farther
he
ought
never
to
have
set
his
foot
in
the
house
of
people
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
it
was
all
jack
pomfret
fault
he
decided
hastily
it
was
his
influence
his
keen
desire
to
make
the
girl
acquaintance
that
had
weighed
down
his
friend
prudence
for
if
left
to
himself
hugh
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
have
dallied
and
dallied
till
all
inclination
to
call
at
rosemount
had
died
down
and
pomfret
had
owned
to
being
greatly
impressed
with
the
fair
young
chatelaine
he
had
admitted
that
he
had
never
met
a
girl
who
had
appealed
to
him
in
quite
the
same
sort
of
way
in
fact
it
was
easy
to
see
he
had
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
jack
was
just
one
of
those
susceptible
sort
of
chaps
who
have
not
an
atom
of
in
their
composition
who
will
obey
their
impulses
regardless
of
consequences
and
he
was
not
his
own
master
his
career
was
practically
at
the
disposal
of
his
somewhat
puritanical
aunt
it
was
just
on
the
cards
that
jack
would
be
mad
enough
to
propose
to
this
girl
who
had
so
bewitched
him
one
could
imagine
how
the
aunt
would
receive
such
a
communication
there
was
one
little
ray
of
hope
however
if
jack
did
commit
such
a
crowning
folly
he
would
be
far
too
honourable
not
to
acquaint
miss
burton
with
his
circumstances
hugh
was
fairly
convinced
that
the
young
lady
knew
how
to
take
care
of
herself
and
even
if
she
did
fall
in
love
with
jack
as
he
had
done
with
her
and
be
inclined
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
there
was
the
objectionable
brother
to
be
reckoned
with
he
would
certainly
not
allow
his
sister
to
engage
herself
to
a
man
except
with
the
consent
of
that
man
family
all
the
same
it
was
as
well
to
avoid
any
embarrassing
entanglements
if
possible
it
is
easy
to
retrace
your
steps
when
you
have
only
just
started
with
this
object
in
view
murchison
sought
his
friend
on
the
sunday
preceding
the
day
on
which
they
were
to
present
themselves
at
rosemount
jack
old
man
i
have
been
thinking
he
began
pomfret
lifted
a
warning
finger
my
dear
friend
and
mentor
indulge
in
such
violent
processes
it
very
bad
for
you
do
be
an
ass
jack
you
are
not
really
funny
when
you
say
that
sort
of
thing
i
been
thinking
over
this
business
and
frankly
i
do
relish
the
prospect
we
had
better
cut
it
out
pomfret
face
took
on
an
obstinate
expression
you
are
speaking
for
yourself
of
course
for
my
part
i
do
intend
to
break
my
appointment
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
an
awfully
thing
to
do
if
you
did
want
to
go
you
should
have
accepted
it
was
evident
the
young
man
was
not
in
a
very
reasonable
frame
of
mind
equally
evident
he
would
require
very
careful
handling
now
jack
do
get
off
the
handles
you
know
you
are
an
awfully
impetuous
chap
and
that
i
have
much
the
cooler
head
of
the
two
i
have
been
thinking
it
all
out
the
last
day
or
two
and
i
do
like
the
look
of
it
you
informed
me
just
now
that
you
had
been
thinking
replied
pomfret
in
the
same
sarcastic
strain
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
upon
the
fact
it
is
obvious
but
the
elder
man
was
not
to
be
ruffled
if
anything
unpleasant
came
of
this
sudden
acquaintance
he
would
lay
the
blame
on
himself
for
having
mentioned
that
little
incident
of
the
and
inspired
the
mercurial
jack
love
of
the
daring
and
adventurous
i
do
know
that
i
did
accept
as
a
matter
of
fact
except
by
implication
i
was
about
to
return
an
evasive
answer
leave
it
in
the
air
so
to
speak
when
you
cut
in
and
jumped
at
the
invitation
for
both
this
was
true
and
pomfret
air
lost
a
little
of
its
jaunty
confidence
well
if
you
think
i
lugged
you
in
get
out
of
it
yourself
of
course
you
will
have
to
tell
some
beastly
lie
that
they
will
see
through
at
once
anyway
i
am
going
and
that
flat
if
you
go
i
shall
go
said
hugh
firmly
but
i
would
like
you
to
listen
to
me
for
a
few
moments
and
put
things
before
you
as
they
present
themselves
to
me
fire
away
then
was
pomfret
answer
but
it
was
delivered
in
a
very
ungracious
tone
of
course
we
are
both
agreed
about
the
brother
began
hugh
mildly
the
other
interrupted
impatiently
the
brother
be
hanged
we
are
not
going
to
the
house
for
the
brother
sake
but
because
of
the
sister
what
the
use
of
blinking
the
fact
if
you
had
met
him
in
the
instead
of
her
i
do
suppose
you
would
have
wasted
a
word
on
him
no
more
should
i
but
i
do
see
why
that
pretty
girl
should
be
ostracised
because
of
him
i
do
quite
see
under
the
circumstances
how
you
can
separate
them
pursued
the
obstinate
hugh
i
should
like
to
turn
off
just
for
a
moment
to
the
sister
and
consider
her
go
ahead
said
pomfret
in
a
somewhat
sullen
tone
he
was
keeping
his
impulsive
and
fiery
nature
under
control
out
of
his
great
respect
for
his
friend
but
it
was
very
doubtful
if
he
would
stand
much
criticism
even
from
one
so
respected
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
her
appearance
or
her
manners
i
will
go
further
and
say
there
is
not
a
girl
in
blankfield
or
for
the
matter
of
that
in
the
itself
who
gives
the
impression
of
a
thorough
gentlewoman
more
convincingly
than
she
does
pomfret
face
brightened
at
these
words
oh
then
you
admit
that
and
you
have
knocked
about
the
world
a
few
years
longer
than
i
have
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
but
if
you
say
it
it
must
be
so
i
do
say
it
unhesitatingly
but
mind
you
i
am
only
judging
from
outside
appearances
now
how
comes
it
that
such
a
refined
and
ladylike
girl
as
that
should
have
such
a
bounder
of
a
brother
there
is
a
mystery
there
jack
pomfret
prepared
to
argue
i
do
quite
agree
that
he
is
a
bounder
he
is
not
quite
boisterous
enough
for
that
let
us
agree
on
a
common
definition
namely
that
he
is
bad
form
that
fits
him
i
think
and
the
sister
is
very
good
form
you
ca
deny
that
there
is
a
mystery
but
the
young
subaltern
developed
a
quite
surprising
ingenuity
in
argument
she
just
simply
calls
him
her
brother
sharply
but
she
has
told
you
he
is
her
halfbrother
by
a
first
marriage
father
a
gentleman
mother
a
common
person
hence
the
bad
form
a
second
time
the
father
married
a
woman
of
his
own
class
hence
norah
burton
norah
knows
him
for
a
good
sort
if
a
bit
rough
and
sticks
to
him
that
a
reasonable
theory
anyway
more
ingenious
than
reasonable
perhaps
commented
murchison
with
an
amused
smile
pomfret
went
on
warming
to
his
subject
and
hang
it
all
if
we
speak
of
bounders
and
mind
you
i
wo
admit
he
is
a
bounder
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
is
there
a
family
in
england
without
them
quite
the
same
sort
do
you
think
was
hugh
question
look
here
i
not
going
to
be
impertinent
and
ask
if
you
can
point
to
any
amongst
your
own
connections
but
i
know
something
of
my
own
family
i
got
a
cousin
good
blood
on
both
sides
he
been
a
bounder
from
the
time
he
learned
to
talk
sets
your
teeth
on
edge
as
some
fellow
said
every
time
he
opens
his
mouth
he
puts
his
foot
into
it
by
gad
this
fellow
burton
is
a
polished
gentleman
to
him
if
george
showed
his
nose
in
this
regiment
they
would
send
him
to
coventry
in
five
minutes
as
they
did
that
chap
last
year
remarked
hugh
alluding
to
an
offensive
young
man
who
had
been
compelled
to
send
in
his
papers
owing
to
the
fact
that
his
general
demeanour
had
not
come
up
to
the
somewhat
exalted
standard
of
the
gallant
precisely
assented
pomfret
but
you
were
going
to
give
me
some
views
about
the
girl
again
i
say
fire
away
well
to
go
back
to
that
meeting
in
the
it
was
to
say
the
least
a
little
unconventional
for
a
young
girl
to
invite
an
utter
stranger
to
call
upon
her
you
were
not
an
utter
stranger
retorted
jack
doggedly
she
had
heard
who
you
were
perhaps
from
the
tradespeople
she
knew
you
were
a
gentleman
she
knew
your
name
captain
murchison
hang
it
all
if
you
had
met
her
in
one
of
these
dull
blankfield
houses
and
she
had
been
introduced
by
a
hostess
about
whom
you
both
knew
precious
little
and
asked
you
to
call
being
the
mistress
of
her
brother
house
you
would
have
thought
it
quite
the
correct
and
proper
thing
so
would
every
man
in
the
barracks
do
people
strike
up
acquaintances
in
hotels
and
sometimes
trains
they
generally
find
out
something
about
each
other
before
they
pursue
the
acquaintance
suggested
murchison
look
here
old
man
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
you
are
arguing
all
round
the
point
it
would
be
precious
easy
for
the
burtons
to
say
who
and
what
they
were
and
furnish
some
proper
credentials
if
they
did
that
i
daresay
all
blankfield
would
call
upon
them
and
swallow
the
brother
for
the
sake
of
the
very
charming
sister
well
i
pump
her
and
get
out
all
you
want
to
know
retorted
pomfret
confidently
i
do
go
so
far
as
to
say
they
will
be
able
to
refer
us
to
burke
or
debrett
decent
people
i
expect
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
such
an
optimist
you
accounted
for
the
brother
i
remember
by
your
ingenious
theory
well
you
made
up
your
mind
to
go
then
most
certainly
i
have
you
do
as
you
like
but
while
we
are
on
the
subject
of
good
form
it
is
not
a
pretty
thing
to
accept
an
invitation
and
then
excuse
yourself
at
the
eleventh
hour
by
an
obvious
lie
under
ordinary
circumstances
you
would
be
quite
right
it
has
not
occurred
to
you
that
we
were
rather
rushed
into
this
dinner
then
that
we
were
so
to
speak
jumped
at
it
might
look
like
it
at
first
blush
admitted
pomfret
reluctantly
but
here
are
two
poor
devils
marooned
as
it
were
in
this
snobbish
town
and
they
naturally
jump
at
the
first
people
who
show
them
the
slightest
civility
they
must
simply
be
aching
to
exchange
a
word
with
their
well
i
am
going
to
exchange
several
with
them
i
promise
you
hugh
felt
it
was
useless
when
pomfret
got
in
these
moods
it
was
waste
of
time
to
reason
with
him
he
felt
uneasy
however
he
had
promised
his
family
to
look
after
him
and
he
felt
a
certain
responsibility
it
was
to
be
hoped
the
sudden
infatuation
for
a
pretty
face
would
expire
as
quickly
as
it
had
been
born
perhaps
a
closer
association
with
the
bounder
brother
would
produce
a
chastening
influence
but
then
jack
seemed
had
he
not
alluded
to
a
cousin
beside
whom
burton
shone
as
a
polished
gentleman
anyway
he
must
not
desert
his
young
and
very
impulsive
friend
but
it
was
with
considerable
reluctance
that
he
accompanied
him
to
rosemount
on
the
monday
night
chapter
iv
was
the
hour
appointed
for
dinner
this
fact
scoring
in
the
burtons
favour
as
evincing
a
knowledge
of
the
habits
of
good
society
even
a
few
of
the
most
select
hostesses
in
blankville
who
ought
to
have
known
better
made
a
base
compromise
with
seven
the
two
men
arrived
about
five
minutes
before
the
time
the
young
hostess
was
awaiting
them
in
the
attired
in
some
filmy
creation
that
made
her
look
very
charming
and
ethereal
soft
lights
from
shaded
lamps
played
about
her
and
lent
a
touch
of
perfection
to
the
picture
burton
was
attired
in
the
usual
conventional
evening
dress
of
the
english
gentleman
one
would
have
guessed
him
the
sort
of
man
who
would
wear
a
tie
not
at
all
he
had
tied
the
bow
himself
and
with
a
masterly
hand
pomfret
even
who
was
admitted
to
be
the
beau
brummel
of
his
regiment
could
not
have
done
it
better
it
is
generally
supposed
that
a
common
man
looks
more
common
still
when
he
dons
evening
attire
george
was
an
exception
to
the
rule
his
black
clothes
became
him
and
lent
him
a
certain
air
of
dignity
which
was
wanting
when
he
assumed
everyday
garments
even
murchison
prejudiced
as
he
was
against
him
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
that
the
bounder
for
once
looked
quite
respectable
pomfret
ever
leaning
to
the
charitable
side
felt
quite
enthusiastic
over
him
and
contrasted
him
favourably
with
his
own
cousin
who
could
boast
blue
blood
on
both
sides
norah
burton
played
the
hostess
as
to
the
manner
born
greeting
the
visitors
with
just
the
right
degree
of
cordiality
quite
free
from
the
effusiveness
of
most
of
the
blankfield
hostesses
and
burton
taking
his
cue
from
her
was
hearty
without
boisterousness
the
young
subaltern
heart
warmed
to
her
she
was
so
gracious
so
sweet
and
about
her
there
hovered
such
an
air
of
calm
dignity
rosemount
no
doubt
was
honoured
by
the
introduction
of
such
distinguished
visitors
viewed
merely
from
the
social
point
of
view
but
she
did
not
permit
a
suspicion
of
this
to
escape
her
rather
judging
by
her
demeanour
the
visitors
were
honoured
by
being
admitted
to
rosemount
rather
reminds
me
of
a
young
queen
entertaining
her
subjects
pomfret
remarked
afterwards
to
his
friend
in
a
rather
enthusiastic
outburst
i
not
speaking
of
the
of
course
but
these
blankfield
women
make
you
feel
they
are
overwhelmed
with
your
condescension
in
coming
to
their
houses
that
they
are
hardly
fit
to
sit
at
the
same
table
with
you
the
dinner
was
plain
but
well
cooked
the
appointments
were
perfect
snowy
napery
elegant
glass
and
cutlery
one
maidservant
waited
and
waited
well
burton
carved
the
dishes
that
were
carvable
there
was
no
pretence
at
an
la
banquet
their
small
establishment
could
not
cope
with
that
and
they
did
not
attempt
it
there
was
a
generous
supply
of
wines
hock
burgundy
and
champagne
and
burton
strangely
subdued
was
quite
a
good
host
hospitable
but
not
pressing
murchison
thought
he
must
have
been
having
some
lessons
from
his
sister
who
seemed
intuitively
to
do
the
right
thing
still
suspicious
he
was
sure
that
she
had
been
steadily
coaching
him
how
to
comport
himself
on
this
important
night
for
after
all
it
must
be
a
feather
in
their
caps
that
after
having
been
coldly
cast
aside
by
the
of
blankfield
they
had
captured
for
their
dining
acquaintance
two
of
the
most
popular
officers
of
the
exclusive
and
murchison
ever
on
the
watch
for
any
little
sign
or
symptom
to
confirm
his
suspicions
had
to
admit
the
pair
were
behaving
perfectly
not
the
slightest
sign
of
elation
at
the
small
social
triumph
manifested
itself
in
the
demeanour
of
either
like
this
might
be
a
common
occurrence
for
all
they
showed
to
the
contrary
the
substantial
portion
of
the
meal
was
over
dessert
was
brought
in
with
port
claret
and
sherry
all
of
the
most
excellent
vintage
the
house
was
a
small
one
and
not
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
lack
of
means
perhaps
the
burtons
were
wise
people
in
not
keeping
up
a
great
show
but
spending
the
greater
part
of
their
income
on
their
personal
enjoyments
while
the
men
were
still
lingering
over
their
dessert
miss
burton
rose
there
are
no
ladies
to
support
me
so
i
shall
feel
quite
lonely
by
myself
she
said
in
her
pretty
softly
modulated
voice
shall
we
have
coffee
in
the
you
men
can
smoke
it
is
quite
liberty
hall
here
my
brother
smokes
in
every
room
of
the
house
murchison
noted
the
subtle
difference
between
the
brother
and
sister
if
burton
had
given
the
invitation
he
would
certainly
have
said
you
gentlemen
the
beautiful
norah
would
not
make
a
mistake
like
that
five
minutes
afterwards
the
three
men
trooped
into
the
pretty
with
its
subdued
shaded
lights
norah
was
sitting
at
a
small
table
on
which
were
set
the
coffee
equipage
with
an
assortment
of
liqueurs
decidedly
the
burtons
knew
how
to
do
things
when
they
received
guests
the
bounder
brother
as
hugh
always
called
him
to
himself
had
drunk
very
heavily
at
dinner
of
every
wine
hock
burgundy
and
champagne
but
evidently
he
could
carry
a
big
quantity
it
would
take
more
than
a
small
like
this
to
knock
him
over
when
he
entered
the
his
mien
was
as
subdued
as
when
he
had
first
received
his
visitors
they
drank
their
coffee
round
the
octagonal
table
and
then
they
broke
up
miss
burton
retired
to
a
chesterfield
whither
followed
her
as
he
was
bound
to
do
burton
bustled
out
of
the
room
and
returned
with
a
huge
box
of
expensive
cigars
he
offered
the
box
to
hugh
who
took
one
with
a
deprecating
look
at
the
young
hostess
we
dare
not
miss
burton
think
of
your
curtains
in
the
morning
do
trouble
captain
murchison
she
said
with
her
charming
smile
the
curtains
have
to
take
what
comes
in
this
house
george
often
sit
in
this
room
but
when
he
does
he
always
smokes
cigars
i
told
you
this
was
liberty
hall
you
know
the
box
was
offered
to
pomfret
who
took
one
do
you
smoke
miss
burton
he
asked
once
in
a
blue
moon
i
think
i
will
have
one
as
a
little
treat
it
is
terribly
tempting
when
i
see
all
you
men
smoking
the
enamoured
pomfret
fetched
her
a
cigarette
hovered
over
her
with
a
match
till
it
was
properly
lighted
and
settled
himself
again
on
the
chesterfield
if
that
silly
old
hugh
did
butt
in
he
was
going
to
have
a
nice
little
chat
with
this
charming
girl
who
had
played
the
young
hostess
to
such
perfection
but
hugh
was
safely
out
of
the
way
burton
had
piloted
him
to
a
comfortable
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
and
these
two
antipathetic
persons
were
apparently
engaged
in
an
interesting
conversation
anyway
murchison
laugh
rang
out
frequently
pomfret
it
must
be
confessed
was
not
very
great
at
conversation
if
the
ball
were
opened
he
could
set
it
rolling
but
he
lacked
initiative
he
looked
at
miss
burton
with
admiring
eyes
but
although
he
had
got
her
comfortably
to
himself
on
that
convenient
chesterfield
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
to
her
and
then
a
brilliant
inspiration
came
to
him
i
say
how
gracefully
you
smoke
the
young
woman
burst
into
a
pleasant
peal
of
quite
spontaneous
laughter
she
always
had
a
ready
smile
at
command
but
her
laughter
was
generally
a
little
forced
this
time
it
was
perfectly
genuine
oh
you
are
really
comical
she
cried
how
can
any
girl
smoke
a
cigarette
gracefully
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
most
unfeminine
thing
to
do
all
people
must
smoke
them
in
the
same
way
and
there
can
never
be
anything
graceful
in
the
act
women
do
smoke
them
the
same
way
replied
the
young
subaltern
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
observed
and
learned
most
of
them
chew
them
and
hold
them
at
arm
length
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
being
bitten
it
because
they
do
like
smoking
really
and
only
do
it
to
be
in
the
fashion
now
when
i
am
quite
in
the
mood
i
actually
revel
in
a
cigarette
i
am
in
the
mood
pomfret
leaned
forward
with
a
tender
expression
on
his
rather
homely
but
countenance
that
means
that
you
feel
happy
eh
she
nodded
brightly
oh
ever
so
happy
it
is
seeing
new
faces
you
know
after
weeks
of
isolation
she
added
with
a
touch
of
almost
girlish
gaiety
it
seems
such
ages
since
we
gave
a
and
you
and
captain
murchison
are
so
nice
it
seems
almost
like
a
family
gathering
you
like
my
friend
murchison
then
i
am
glad
because
it
is
to
him
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
i
think
he
is
a
dear
he
seems
so
honest
straightforward
and
so
reliable
she
spoke
with
apparent
conviction
were
you
not
dreadfully
shocked
when
he
told
you
for
of
course
he
must
have
told
you
how
we
got
to
know
each
other
not
in
the
least
said
pomfret
stoutly
i
explained
to
him
that
people
can
become
acquainted
without
being
properly
introduced
in
the
conventional
sort
of
way
ah
then
he
had
some
doubts
himself
flashed
miss
burton
i
expect
he
was
a
little
shocked
if
you
were
not
not
in
the
slightest
i
assure
you
replied
pomfret
easily
he
was
not
above
telling
a
white
lie
upon
occasions
he
remembered
too
well
the
remarks
that
his
friend
had
made
upon
the
girl
unconventional
behaviour
but
he
was
not
going
to
admit
anything
miss
burton
spoke
softly
after
a
brief
pause
you
and
captain
murchison
are
very
great
friends
are
you
not
awful
pals
was
the
genuine
response
you
see
he
knows
all
my
family
and
when
i
joined
the
regiment
they
deputed
him
to
look
after
me
he
has
got
a
hard
task
he
added
with
a
laugh
oh
not
so
very
hard
really
i
am
sure
of
that
norah
voice
was
very
sweet
very
caressing
but
you
and
your
friend
are
of
very
different
temperaments
in
what
way
she
smiled
oh
in
half
a
hundred
ways
captain
murchison
is
as
true
as
steel
but
also
as
hard
as
steel
you
now
are
not
in
the
least
hard
you
are
very
kind
and
compassionate
you
think
the
best
of
everybody
do
flatter
me
too
much
please
interjected
the
bashful
pomfret
oh
pardon
me
i
know
just
the
kind
of
man
you
are
the
sweet
face
was
very
close
to
his
own
the
beautiful
rather
sad
eyes
were
looking
steadily
into
his
you
are
a
rich
man
or
you
would
not
be
in
this
expensive
regiment
but
if
you
were
a
poor
man
and
you
had
only
ten
pounds
in
your
pocket
you
would
lend
an
impecunious
friend
five
of
them
and
not
trouble
whether
he
repaid
you
or
not
i
think
you
have
fitted
me
miss
burton
my
dear
old
chum
hugh
is
never
tired
of
telling
me
i
am
an
awful
ass
you
are
both
right
really
answered
miss
burton
you
see
we
look
at
life
from
two
different
standpoints
i
fancy
you
come
from
two
different
classes
queried
the
charming
young
woman
pomfret
felt
a
little
embarrassed
he
did
not
want
to
give
away
his
particular
chum
but
there
were
no
doubt
certain
inherited
commercial
instincts
in
hugh
that
sometimes
offended
the
descendant
of
a
more
careless
and
aristocratic
family
you
see
hugh
has
come
from
the
trading
class
originally
his
ancestors
no
doubt
were
people
hugh
is
not
himself
he
is
in
a
certain
way
the
soul
of
generosity
but
sometimes
the
old
adam
peeps
out
in
little
things
he
had
a
swift
pang
of
remorse
when
he
had
said
this
for
he
suddenly
remembered
hugh
generous
offer
of
the
two
hundred
which
pomfret
by
a
very
diplomatic
letter
was
going
to
cajole
out
of
the
octogenarian
believe
me
added
he
fervently
hugh
is
one
of
the
best
he
is
a
little
peculiar
sometimes
in
small
things
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
as
i
have
done
i
am
more
than
sorry
if
i
have
conveyed
a
wrong
impression
of
him
but
you
have
not
cried
norah
burton
swiftly
he
would
be
hard
in
some
things
i
am
sure
for
instance
he
would
never
forgive
a
really
dishonourable
action
even
in
the
case
of
his
best
friend
no
i
am
sure
he
would
not
assented
pomfret
but
i
do
fancy
he
has
been
much
tried
that
way
we
do
get
many
amongst
our
lot
quoted
miss
burton
lightly
then
she
added
more
seriously
and
i
am
sure
he
is
very
and
thoughtful
i
was
impressed
with
his
reluctance
to
smoke
because
of
the
curtains
of
course
he
did
not
remember
that
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
as
we
never
have
callers
she
was
getting
on
the
theme
of
their
social
isolation
but
pomfret
was
sure
that
unlike
her
brother
strangely
subdued
from
his
usual
boisterousness
she
would
handle
the
subject
with
her
customary
tact
and
good
taste
ah
of
course
all
that
is
very
regrettable
it
is
not
so
much
your
loss
as
the
loss
of
blankfield
i
suppose
you
wo
stay
very
long
here
for
a
moment
there
came
a
blazing
light
in
the
soft
beautiful
eyes
a
few
days
ago
i
advised
my
brother
to
pack
up
and
clear
out
the
snobbish
plutocracy
of
blankfield
had
beaten
us
made
up
of
retired
shopkeepers
and
merchants
with
you
and
captain
murchison
as
our
guests
i
think
we
have
beaten
blankfield
with
its
fat
mothers
and
plain
daughters
she
looked
superb
as
she
drew
her
slender
form
up
to
its
full
height
the
glow
of
indignant
triumph
blazing
on
her
cheek
at
the
moment
she
was
extremely
beautiful
if
pomfret
had
been
attracted
before
he
was
infatuated
now
i
will
help
you
to
beat
the
blankfield
people
for
whom
i
do
care
a
row
of
pins
i
will
come
whenever
you
want
me
and
your
friend
captain
murchison
will
he
come
too
pomfret
smiled
whimsically
oh
yes
he
will
come
if
i
make
a
point
of
it
old
hugh
thinks
he
leads
me
but
i
really
lead
him
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
can
you
bring
some
of
your
brother
officers
pomfret
please
do
think
i
am
bold
and
forward
and
presumptuous
but
i
do
long
to
be
even
with
these
blankfield
people
i
would
love
to
make
a
little
sort
of
of
my
own
i
know
it
is
useless
to
expect
the
women
at
present
but
they
might
come
in
time
mind
you
i
do
want
them
i
will
try
said
pomfret
slowly
i
think
i
may
say
that
hugh
and
i
are
the
two
most
popular
men
in
the
regiment
i
say
it
without
vanity
and
i
do
suppose
we
care
a
snap
of
the
fingers
about
the
blankfield
people
still
i
do
want
to
raise
hopes
that
may
never
be
fulfilled
i
can
only
say
i
will
try
there
was
a
pause
then
she
spoke
and
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
you
hesitate
i
see
oh
i
quite
believe
you
when
you
say
you
will
try
but
there
is
some
in
the
way
is
there
pomfret
had
perforce
to
dissemble
there
is
no
that
i
know
of
except
running
the
risk
of
offending
blankfield
that
is
not
a
great
one
as
we
shall
be
out
of
here
in
about
two
months
she
leaned
closer
to
him
and
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
there
is
a
i
know
you
are
too
kind
and
generous
to
state
what
it
is
you
could
not
as
he
is
your
host
it
is
my
brother
and
then
poor
infatuated
pomfret
sought
no
further
refuge
in
subterfuge
he
blurted
out
the
truth
some
of
our
chaps
would
stand
him
you
know
he
said
simply
there
was
a
little
convulsive
movement
of
the
delicate
hands
and
he
is
such
a
dear
good
fellow
at
heart
wanting
i
know
in
the
little
delicacies
that
mark
a
real
gentleman
you
see
a
great
difference
between
us
do
you
a
very
distinct
difference
assented
pomfret
i
will
explain
it
to
you
in
a
few
words
my
father
was
a
sort
of
person
as
i
told
you
last
time
you
were
here
and
when
he
was
a
boy
of
he
married
a
woman
out
of
his
own
class
a
or
a
barmaid
i
am
not
quite
sure
which
george
is
many
years
older
than
myself
as
i
told
you
he
is
really
my
halfbrother
the
first
wife
died
my
father
married
again
this
time
a
lady
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
second
marriage
now
i
think
you
understand
pomfret
was
delighted
at
this
avowal
it
proved
his
own
prescience
i
am
so
glad
you
told
me
but
as
it
happens
it
was
just
what
i
guessed
miss
burton
looked
at
him
with
admiring
eyes
you
are
really
very
clever
you
know
well
i
will
not
exactly
say
this
is
a
secret
but
you
will
whisper
it
about
discreetly
you
need
not
be
quite
so
frank
as
i
have
been
about
details
but
you
can
hint
at
a
i
hate
to
have
to
tell
you
so
much
for
my
brother
has
been
so
good
to
me
ah
pomfret
air
plainly
showed
that
he
was
eager
for
further
information
and
miss
burton
was
quite
willing
to
gratify
him
the
young
man
was
a
pleasant
comfortable
sort
of
person
to
talk
to
he
was
an
admirable
listener
and
never
broke
in
with
unnecessary
or
irritating
interruptions
when
my
father
died
he
left
little
behind
him
but
debts
my
mother
had
preceded
him
some
ten
years
poor
george
had
gone
into
a
office
through
the
good
offices
of
a
distant
connection
his
salary
was
very
small
but
he
made
a
home
for
me
he
would
not
hear
of
my
earning
my
own
living
that
could
not
have
been
very
long
ago
remarked
pomfret
because
you
are
not
very
old
now
no
it
was
not
long
answered
the
girl
not
committing
herself
to
any
definite
dates
well
we
had
a
very
hard
time
as
you
can
imagine
then
suddenly
our
luck
changed
an
uncle
of
george
on
his
mother
side
had
gone
out
to
australia
as
a
boy
and
amassed
we
wo
say
a
fortune
from
your
point
of
view
but
what
we
should
look
upon
as
wealth
he
had
never
married
and
when
he
died
a
will
was
found
in
which
he
left
all
he
was
possessed
of
to
his
sister
children
george
was
the
only
child
so
he
took
it
all
so
he
threw
up
business
and
went
in
for
a
country
life
well
he
has
thrown
it
up
for
a
time
i
am
not
quite
certain
he
will
not
get
tired
of
inactivity
and
go
back
to
it
now
that
he
has
capital
it
would
be
easy
for
him
to
embark
in
something
that
would
keep
him
occupied
and
pay
him
well
not
a
sportsman
i
suppose
he
does
care
for
hunting
or
shooting
the
country
is
slow
for
a
man
if
he
does
do
something
in
that
line
the
pretty
girl
smiled
there
was
a
faint
touch
of
humour
in
the
smile
oh
he
not
rich
enough
to
indulge
in
luxuries
of
that
sort
besides
she
added
hastily
he
has
such
wretched
sight
he
would
be
no
good
at
sport
pomfret
thought
it
had
been
a
very
pleasant
enlightening
conversation
norah
seemed
to
have
been
perfectly
frank
about
their
past
and
their
present
position
she
did
not
pretend
to
be
anything
but
what
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
spendthrift
father
living
on
what
was
practically
the
charity
of
a
brother
and
that
brother
was
indebted
for
his
good
fortune
to
a
relative
who
must
have
been
a
man
of
the
people
while
the
two
young
people
were
having
this
confidential
chat
burton
was
making
himself
agreeable
to
the
other
guest
in
his
doubtless
but
somewhat
undiplomatic
fashion
i
do
envy
you
young
fellows
when
i
see
you
walking
about
as
if
the
world
belonged
to
you
hugh
drew
himself
up
stiffly
i
was
not
in
the
least
aware
that
any
one
of
us
conveyed
that
impression
no
offence
meant
i
assure
you
hugh
tone
showed
him
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
bad
taste
a
blessing
norah
had
not
heard
she
would
have
given
him
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
later
on
but
all
army
men
i
think
get
a
certain
kind
of
swagger
oh
nothing
overbearing
or
unpleasant
about
it
of
course
they
are
made
so
much
of
that
there
is
no
wonder
if
they
do
fancy
themselves
a
bit
i
sure
i
should
if
i
were
one
of
them
murchison
made
no
comment
on
this
frank
statement
and
the
other
man
rambled
on
in
desultory
fashion
it
the
life
i
wanted
as
a
boy
i
longed
to
grow
up
quickly
and
go
into
the
army
there
was
a
fair
chance
of
it
then
when
the
old
man
had
still
got
a
bit
of
money
left
but
by
the
time
i
was
old
enough
the
idea
had
to
be
knocked
on
the
head
i
had
to
go
into
a
dingy
stockbroking
office
instead
hugh
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
announcement
he
had
not
suspected
that
the
man
would
be
so
communicative
about
his
past
of
course
he
had
gone
as
a
clerk
if
his
father
was
not
enough
to
put
him
in
the
army
neither
could
he
have
afforded
to
buy
him
a
share
in
a
business
yes
pursued
burton
it
was
an
awful
come
down
after
the
dreams
i
had
indulged
in
it
must
have
been
a
very
bitter
disappointment
assented
hugh
politely
in
spite
of
his
firm
conviction
that
the
army
was
the
very
last
profession
in
the
world
suited
to
a
man
of
his
host
obvious
peculiarities
i
should
have
been
awfully
keen
on
soldiering
pursued
burton
under
the
impression
that
he
had
discovered
a
sympathetic
listener
do
you
consider
it
a
splendid
life
there
are
many
things
in
its
favour
certainly
was
the
rather
frigid
reply
but
after
all
i
do
think
i
should
have
cared
to
be
in
the
line
there
not
the
same
glamour
about
it
is
there
you
fellows
in
the
cavalry
in
a
crack
regiment
like
yours
must
see
the
rosy
side
of
life
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
of
course
you
all
got
pots
of
money
to
grease
the
wheels
hugh
fidgeted
perceptibly
how
very
vulgar
the
man
was
with
an
innate
vulgarity
that
nothing
would
ever
eradicate
but
his
host
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
did
not
observe
the
movement
of
course
we
know
all
about
you
about
the
great
house
of
murchison
you
are
all
right
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
what
about
that
young
chap
yonder
i
suppose
he
rolling
in
money
too
it
was
growing
insufferable
for
two
pins
hugh
would
have
got
up
and
bidden
him
goodnight
then
and
there
but
he
shrank
from
making
a
scene
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
come
here
to
allow
his
kindly
feeling
for
that
susceptible
young
donkey
of
a
pomfret
to
expose
him
to
such
an
ordeal
as
this
really
burton
he
said
in
a
cutting
voice
i
do
not
discuss
the
private
affairs
of
my
friends
on
such
a
brief
acquaintance
if
you
are
really
anxious
to
know
i
believe
pomfret
has
considerable
expectations
from
an
old
aunt
who
is
fairly
wealthy
those
expectations
depend
i
understand
upon
his
conforming
generally
to
her
wishes
in
all
respects
ah
i
understand
said
the
unabashed
burton
sorry
if
my
question
gave
you
offence
what
really
put
it
in
my
head
was
the
difference
between
his
position
and
mine
when
i
was
his
age
there
was
silence
for
some
little
time
while
the
two
men
applied
themselves
steadily
to
their
cigars
then
burton
jumped
up
suddenly
this
must
be
a
bit
slow
for
you
and
your
friend
and
the
night
is
young
what
do
you
say
to
a
game
at
bridge
yes
captain
murchison
would
welcome
a
game
of
bridge
anything
as
a
relief
to
this
vulgarian
conversation
they
played
for
over
two
hours
murchison
keenly
alert
from
certain
suspicions
that
had
been
forming
in
his
mind
at
present
there
was
no
foundation
for
these
vague
suspicions
they
played
for
small
stakes
but
the
visitors
rose
up
the
winners
not
by
a
great
amount
but
still
winners
it
was
a
fine
night
the
two
men
walked
back
to
their
quarters
how
did
you
get
on
with
the
charmer
i
saw
you
seemed
very
confidential
together
asked
the
older
man
splendidly
old
chap
she
told
me
a
lot
about
her
history
pomfret
related
all
he
had
been
told
in
full
and
how
did
you
get
on
with
the
brother
do
ask
me
replied
hugh
with
a
groan
he
the
most
insufferable
creature
i
ever
came
across
i
do
really
think
i
can
go
there
again
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
he
started
fairly
well
but
later
he
reverted
to
type
well
i
may
as
well
tell
you
straight
i
shall
the
next
time
we
go
i
take
a
share
of
the
brother
when
pomfret
spoke
in
that
tone
he
meant
what
he
said
and
hugh
knew
he
would
have
his
own
wilful
way
there
was
one
piece
of
information
which
the
young
subaltern
had
not
imparted
to
his
friend
it
was
this
that
after
much
pressing
and
more
than
one
refusal
miss
burton
had
agreed
to
meet
him
afternoon
at
a
very
sequestered
spot
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
blankfield
with
the
view
of
pursuing
their
acquaintance
chapter
v
the
night
of
that
murchison
noted
a
subtle
difference
in
his
young
friend
demeanour
pomfret
had
always
been
a
sort
of
young
fellow
accustomed
to
follow
erratic
and
injudicious
impulses
not
absolutely
devoid
of
brains
of
a
certain
order
but
of
imperfect
and
mentality
but
in
his
wildest
escapades
he
had
always
been
frank
and
and
he
was
ever
the
first
when
he
had
overstepped
the
to
admit
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
and
on
such
occasions
far
from
justifying
his
exploits
he
had
been
ready
to
deplore
them
but
his
frankness
seemed
to
have
departed
from
that
night
he
seemed
rather
to
avoid
than
seek
the
society
of
his
old
friend
and
mentor
when
hugh
brought
up
the
subject
of
the
burtons
pomfret
seemed
anxious
to
avoid
it
to
say
as
little
as
possible
he
seemed
to
shut
himself
up
within
his
own
soul
hugh
of
course
was
profoundly
uneasy
such
a
transparent
creature
as
pomfret
would
not
be
likely
to
retire
within
his
own
shell
unless
there
were
cogent
reasons
for
the
withdrawal
and
the
reasons
were
inspired
by
the
attractive
personality
of
the
fascinating
siren
at
rosemount
the
charming
young
woman
who
explained
the
presence
of
an
undesirable
brother
by
the
narrative
of
her
father
first
unfortunate
marriage
pomfret
had
invited
the
brother
and
sister
to
a
dinner
at
the
principal
hotel
in
the
place
and
hugh
had
been
his
friend
guest
ladies
of
course
could
not
be
asked
to
the
mess
it
had
been
a
happy
solution
of
a
somewhat
awkward
position
burton
no
doubt
understood
but
he
accepted
the
situation
with
alacrity
from
the
dinner
they
had
adjourned
to
rosemount
here
they
had
played
cards
as
before
but
they
left
off
fairly
even
hugh
suspicions
about
were
dissipated
as
before
at
the
same
time
he
was
still
resolved
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
pair
it
was
firmly
engrained
upon
his
mind
and
only
of
course
from
the
purest
instinct
that
he
did
not
trust
either
of
them
much
to
his
surprise
they
left
without
having
been
asked
to
a
return
dinner
it
was
the
turn
of
the
burtons
and
judging
from
the
haste
with
which
burton
had
jumped
at
them
on
the
first
visit
the
omission
was
a
little
noticeable
it
could
not
be
that
these
new
isolated
dwellers
in
blankfield
wanted
to
shelve
an
acquaintance
which
must
have
brightened
their
dull
and
unvisited
existence
another
fact
presented
itself
to
murchison
rather
acute
intelligence
there
seemed
already
established
between
pomfret
and
the
attractive
norah
a
certain
kind
of
freemasonry
a
certain
sort
of
easy
relations
and
once
in
the
course
of
the
evening
he
was
sure
that
he
heard
the
young
man
in
the
course
of
a
whispered
conversation
address
her
by
her
christian
name
they
had
been
sitting
together
on
the
chesterfield
and
their
remarks
to
each
other
had
been
addressed
in
a
very
low
tone
but
hugh
hearing
was
wonderfully
acute
and
he
had
surprised
a
sudden
expression
of
rebuke
in
miss
burton
eyes
when
pomfret
made
the
slip
and
here
for
a
moment
this
story
must
leave
hugh
murchison
with
his
honest
doubts
and
suspicions
while
it
follows
the
fortunes
of
his
young
friend
and
the
attractive
norah
burton
for
truth
to
tell
at
this
particular
juncture
young
pomfret
for
all
his
apparent
guilelessness
was
pursuing
a
double
game
madly
overwhelmingly
in
love
with
norah
he
was
meeting
her
clandestinely
sometimes
at
her
own
house
sometimes
in
sequestered
spots
in
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
and
of
these
visits
and
meetings
hugh
knew
nothing
pomfret
was
not
free
from
a
few
pangs
of
from
the
fact
that
he
was
not
running
quite
straight
with
good
old
hugh
to
whom
he
had
always
hitherto
confessed
all
his
difficulties
and
troubles
but
then
hugh
although
one
of
the
best
was
such
a
practical
old
stick
and
if
he
told
him
the
whole
truth
there
was
no
knowing
what
course
hugh
might
not
think
it
was
his
duty
to
take
he
might
write
to
his
family
and
bring
them
down
in
an
avalanche
on
him
or
even
to
the
octogenarian
aunt
love
taught
him
deep
cunning
and
what
he
lacked
in
this
subtle
quality
was
ably
supplemented
by
miss
burton
this
young
girl
with
the
rather
sad
expression
and
the
candid
eyes
that
always
met
your
gaze
unfalteringly
from
the
first
clandestine
meeting
arranged
in
whispers
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
at
pomfret
had
made
the
running
very
fast
he
had
given
norah
to
understand
that
he
thought
her
the
most
desirable
girl
he
had
ever
met
that
no
other
woman
had
appealed
would
or
could
appeal
to
him
as
she
did
there
was
a
good
drop
of
irish
blood
in
his
own
veins
and
he
certainly
made
a
most
fervent
lover
norah
listened
with
a
modest
bashfulness
that
enchanted
him
he
was
sure
from
her
demeanour
that
she
had
never
been
made
love
to
before
she
seemed
so
overwhelmed
that
she
could
hardly
say
a
word
if
one
were
not
so
much
in
love
one
might
almost
have
thought
she
was
stupid
she
was
not
so
stupid
however
as
not
to
preserve
her
wits
sufficiently
to
make
another
appointment
this
time
at
rosemount
pomfret
consented
gladly
but
he
made
a
certain
stipulation
which
his
companion
was
more
than
pleased
to
agree
to
we
must
let
old
hugh
know
about
this
though
or
he
think
left
out
in
the
cold
you
see
it
was
really
through
him
i
knew
you
you
must
tell
your
brother
not
to
let
it
out
miss
burton
promised
that
so
far
as
she
and
her
brother
were
concerned
captain
murchison
would
be
none
the
wiser
it
only
remained
for
pomfret
although
entreated
to
do
so
she
could
not
at
this
early
stage
address
him
as
jack
to
surround
his
movements
with
a
proper
degree
of
mystery
when
the
two
parted
and
the
meeting
had
been
rather
a
brief
one
for
it
was
always
a
little
dangerous
lingering
long
about
the
environs
of
blankfield
in
case
of
unexpected
intruders
miss
burton
made
a
significant
remark
i
am
quite
sure
your
friend
captain
murchison
does
not
like
me
in
fact
i
think
his
real
feeling
is
one
of
dislike
pomfret
was
young
enough
to
blush
he
did
so
upon
this
occasion
he
guessed
the
real
truth
that
murchison
did
not
dislike
her
at
all
on
the
contrary
he
rather
admired
her
but
he
had
a
certain
distrust
of
her
fancy
on
your
part
fancy
i
quite
sure
he
answered
glibly
i
expect
he
is
a
little
bit
sore
you
know
about
the
whole
thing
thinks
i
have
cut
him
out
with
you
perhaps
assented
norah
easily
but
in
her
own
heart
she
knew
it
was
nothing
of
the
kind
she
recognised
at
once
the
difference
between
the
two
men
murchison
was
a
thorough
gentleman
kind
and
chivalrous
but
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
with
a
certain
hard
strain
in
him
a
man
who
would
submit
everything
to
the
test
of
cold
practical
reasoning
not
to
be
hoodwinked
or
led
astray
this
poor
babbling
boy
with
his
unrestrained
impulses
that
celtic
leaven
in
his
blood
would
fall
an
easy
prey
to
any
woman
who
was
clever
enough
to
cast
her
spells
over
him
he
would
never
reason
he
would
only
feel
after
that
first
meeting
the
precursor
of
many
others
the
affair
progressed
briskly
pomfret
made
love
with
great
ardour
norah
received
his
advances
with
a
shy
sort
of
acquiescence
that
inflamed
him
the
more
he
was
sure
oh
very
sure
he
was
the
first
who
had
touched
that
innocent
heart
from
these
delightful
confidences
murchison
was
shut
out
it
would
not
be
wise
to
ignore
him
altogether
for
such
a
course
of
action
would
have
intensified
his
suspicions
but
the
invitations
to
rosemount
from
either
host
or
hostess
were
few
and
far
between
he
was
not
however
so
easily
gulled
as
the
three
conspirators
thought
pomfret
preoccupied
mood
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
much
on
his
mind
his
frequent
and
unexplained
absences
gave
to
his
friend
much
food
for
thought
he
felt
certain
that
the
irresponsible
young
man
was
entangling
himself
but
in
such
a
state
of
affairs
he
felt
powerless
short
of
invoking
the
influence
of
the
colonel
or
writing
to
the
elderly
aunt
he
could
do
nothing
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
course
of
true
love
was
running
very
smoothly
even
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
ardent
and
enamoured
suitor
himself
in
spite
of
his
impulsive
temperament
his
disinclination
to
look
hard
facts
squarely
in
the
face
there
was
in
him
a
slight
leaven
of
save
for
the
bounty
and
goodwill
of
this
generous
if
somewhat
aunt
he
was
an
absolute
pauper
there
was
no
hope
of
marrying
without
her
consent
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
in
a
case
like
this
her
consent
would
never
be
given
a
to
be
received
by
her
with
approval
must
present
some
sort
of
credentials
and
there
was
the
difficulty
poor
jack
had
exhausted
all
his
simple
cunning
to
extract
from
them
some
convincing
details
of
their
antecedents
but
even
he
infatuated
as
he
was
had
to
admit
that
they
had
parried
inquiries
with
great
adroitness
they
maintained
a
persistent
reticence
as
to
names
and
places
even
he
was
forced
to
conclude
that
for
some
reason
or
another
they
did
not
choose
to
be
frank
about
their
past
these
obvious
facts
however
did
not
lessen
his
infatuation
to
marry
her
was
the
one
dominating
object
of
his
life
in
spite
of
all
that
his
few
remaining
remnants
of
could
urge
against
such
a
step
more
than
once
the
rash
idea
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
marry
her
in
secret
and
when
the
marriage
was
an
accomplished
fact
throw
himself
upon
his
aunt
forgiveness
he
mooted
the
idea
to
norah
to
whom
of
course
he
had
already
made
a
frank
statement
of
his
position
as
befitted
the
honourable
gentleman
he
was
but
she
did
not
receive
the
suggestion
with
enthusiasm
although
she
professed
to
fully
reciprocate
his
ardent
affection
if
i
were
a
selfish
girl
and
only
thought
of
my
immediate
happiness
i
should
say
she
said
with
a
little
tremulous
smile
that
made
her
look
more
desirable
than
ever
in
her
lover
eyes
but
i
could
not
allow
to
run
such
a
terrible
risk
old
people
are
very
strange
and
very
touchy
when
they
think
they
have
been
slighted
suppose
she
cast
you
off
i
suppose
i
could
work
as
thousands
have
to
do
replied
jack
with
a
touch
of
his
old
doggedness
she
shook
her
head
my
poor
jack
it
is
easy
to
talk
of
working
but
you
have
got
to
find
an
employer
and
you
have
been
brought
up
to
an
idle
life
what
could
you
turn
your
hand
to
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
as
an
and
besides
my
brother
would
never
sanction
it
even
to
pomfret
slow
revolving
mind
the
worldly
taint
in
her
just
peeped
forth
in
those
sensible
remarks
if
i
am
prepared
to
risk
my
aunt
displeasure
you
can
surely
afford
to
risk
your
brother
he
queried
angrily
but
norah
disarmed
him
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
be
reasonable
dearest
we
must
not
behave
like
a
pair
of
silly
children
and
besides
there
is
a
certain
moral
obligation
on
both
sides
you
owe
everything
to
your
aunt
i
owe
everything
to
my
brother
it
would
be
very
base
to
ignore
them
jack
was
touched
by
the
nobility
of
these
last
sentiments
you
are
much
better
than
i
am
norah
much
less
selfish
she
caressed
his
curly
head
with
her
hand
we
must
have
patience
jack
you
have
told
me
as
plainly
as
your
dear
kind
heart
would
allow
you
to
tell
me
that
for
reasons
which
i
do
want
you
to
explain
your
aunt
would
never
give
her
consent
to
your
marriage
with
me
well
we
must
wait
in
plain
english
her
meaning
was
that
they
must
possess
their
souls
in
patience
till
such
time
as
this
excellent
old
lady
had
departed
this
life
the
suggestion
was
certainly
a
coldblooded
one
but
in
his
present
infatuated
mood
jack
did
not
take
any
notice
of
that
norah
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
gloss
over
the
callousness
of
her
remarks
by
adding
that
although
it
was
a
very
horrible
thing
to
have
to
wait
for
the
shoes
of
dead
people
a
person
of
miss
harding
great
age
must
expect
to
very
shortly
pay
the
debt
of
nature
two
days
later
jack
received
a
telegram
which
seemed
to
give
a
certain
air
of
prophecy
to
the
young
woman
forebodings
it
was
dispatched
to
him
from
his
aunt
home
in
cheshire
by
the
local
doctor
who
had
attended
her
for
years
it
informed
him
that
she
was
seriously
ill
and
requested
his
immediate
attendance
he
sought
the
colonel
at
once
and
obtained
leave
there
was
no
time
to
call
at
but
he
scribbled
a
hasty
note
to
miss
burton
explaining
matters
on
his
arrival
he
found
his
aged
relative
very
bad
indeed
she
had
had
a
severe
stroke
the
second
in
two
years
and
doctor
jephson
was
very
doubtful
as
to
whether
her
vitality
would
enable
her
to
recover
he
added
that
she
had
a
marvellous
constitution
and
in
such
a
case
one
could
not
absolutely
say
there
was
no
hope
of
a
feebler
woman
he
would
have
said
at
once
a
few
hours
would
see
the
end
pomfret
stayed
there
as
long
as
the
result
was
in
doubt
at
the
end
of
three
days
the
brave
old
lady
rallied
in
the
most
wonderful
way
and
was
able
to
hold
a
little
conversation
with
her
beloved
nephew
he
did
not
leave
till
the
doctor
assured
him
that
she
was
out
of
danger
it
a
wonderful
recovery
said
doctor
jephson
as
he
shook
hands
at
parting
with
the
young
man
but
it
the
beginning
of
the
end
i
give
her
very
long
now
a
few
months
at
the
most
well
she
has
had
a
wonderful
life
hardly
an
ache
or
a
pain
till
the
last
few
years
and
then
nothing
very
severe
but
of
course
the
machinery
is
worn
out
all
the
way
back
to
blankfield
those
words
kept
repeating
themselves
in
his
ears
i
do
give
her
very
long
now
a
few
months
at
the
most
and
then
an
idea
began
to
form
in
his
mind
he
was
not
so
callous
that
he
wanted
his
poor
old
aunt
to
die
quickly
but
it
was
obvious
the
time
could
not
be
long
delayed
when
he
would
find
himself
possessed
of
her
fortune
the
master
of
his
own
destinies
was
there
any
reason
why
he
should
not
forestall
that
period
by
the
rather
daring
expedient
of
a
secret
marriage
they
were
both
young
even
if
the
doctor
was
wrong
and
they
had
to
wait
four
or
five
years
it
was
not
a
great
sacrifice
of
their
youth
at
least
that
was
his
way
of
looking
at
it
of
course
he
did
not
know
how
she
would
take
the
suggestion
she
appeared
to
listen
to
him
with
deep
interest
and
attention
when
he
unfolded
his
plans
he
explained
that
he
had
a
very
handsome
allowance
which
up
to
the
present
he
had
generally
exceeded
now
that
could
all
be
altered
he
would
declare
that
he
was
sick
of
the
army
and
send
in
his
papers
through
his
family
influence
he
would
get
some
government
appointment
which
necessitated
his
living
in
london
he
would
take
inexpensive
chambers
for
himself
rent
a
small
house
for
her
in
some
pleasant
and
not
too
remote
suburb
and
spend
as
much
of
his
time
as
possible
with
her
you
do
think
your
aunt
would
reduce
your
allowance
if
you
left
the
army
was
the
one
pertinent
question
she
put
to
him
when
he
had
finished
on
the
contrary
she
would
be
more
likely
to
increase
it
was
the
confident
rejoinder
she
would
always
have
preferred
that
i
should
go
in
for
something
that
meant
real
work
she
thinks
the
army
is
an
idle
life
miss
burton
no
doubt
rapidly
calculated
the
pros
and
cons
of
such
a
daring
step
jack
had
named
a
very
handsome
sum
for
her
maintenance
if
she
could
put
up
with
the
clandestine
nature
of
the
connection
till
such
time
as
a
certain
event
happened
she
would
be
better
off
than
at
rosemount
she
begged
for
time
to
think
it
over
and
of
course
she
would
have
to
consult
her
brother
before
taking
such
an
unusual
step
that
was
only
natural
it
was
impossible
for
jack
to
insist
that
she
should
settle
the
matter
herself
without
reference
to
the
one
person
who
whatever
his
social
defects
had
behaved
to
her
with
unexampled
kindness
and
generosity
brother
and
sister
no
doubt
talked
it
over
very
thoroughly
for
it
was
three
days
before
she
told
her
lover
that
although
george
would
have
preferred
a
longer
period
of
waiting
he
trusted
him
sufficiently
to
entrust
norah
to
his
keeping
on
the
terms
proposed
she
did
suggest
that
they
should
wait
till
jack
had
left
the
army
and
settled
himself
in
london
but
he
fought
this
idea
stubbornly
he
was
mad
to
tie
her
to
himself
for
fear
that
somebody
else
with
more
immediate
prospects
might
step
in
and
carry
her
off
a
little
of
course
might
have
told
him
that
if
she
was
as
fatally
attractive
to
others
as
to
himself
she
would
have
been
carried
off
before
this
he
was
so
terribly
jealous
of
her
that
he
had
never
made
the
slightest
effort
to
bring
any
of
his
brother
officers
round
to
he
even
kept
hugh
away
as
much
as
he
could
the
lovers
worked
out
their
little
plot
very
nicely
miss
burton
would
leave
blankfield
for
a
couple
of
weeks
ostensibly
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
relative
her
destination
would
be
london
jack
would
take
a
few
leave
of
absence
in
due
course
and
procure
a
special
licence
they
would
return
on
separate
days
and
resume
their
normal
life
until
such
time
as
they
perfected
their
after
arrangements
chapter
vi
burton
arrived
home
on
a
monday
by
a
train
her
attentive
brother
met
her
at
the
station
she
was
one
of
those
girls
who
look
smart
and
neat
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
although
it
was
a
long
journey
she
bore
no
signs
or
stains
of
travel
when
does
jack
arrive
not
too
soon
i
hope
commented
george
as
he
assisted
her
into
a
cab
and
sat
down
beside
her
he
wanted
to
come
down
but
i
vetoed
that
responded
the
girl
i
told
him
people
might
put
two
and
two
together
he
will
get
here
i
shall
meet
him
casually
in
the
high
street
he
is
going
to
bring
murchison
along
with
him
and
i
shall
give
them
an
impromptu
invitation
to
dinner
i
do
know
that
i
am
very
keen
on
having
murchison
to
dinner
remarked
burton
in
rather
a
growling
tone
miss
burton
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
perhaps
of
the
two
i
am
less
keen
than
you
are
but
we
have
got
to
play
it
pretty
quiet
down
here
till
the
whole
lot
of
us
clear
out
better
to
let
murchison
come
he
is
pretty
suspicious
as
it
is
but
if
we
shut
him
out
he
be
more
suspicious
still
burton
chuckled
in
a
grim
fashion
well
our
inquisitive
friend
the
whole
lot
of
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
ca
do
you
much
harm
now
you
got
him
tight
enough
and
say
this
for
him
he
a
bit
soft
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
always
play
the
game
the
girl
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
then
she
spoke
in
a
voice
that
was
low
and
soft
yes
he
a
dear
little
chap
he
always
play
the
game
he
can
afford
to
was
the
rather
ungracious
comment
clearly
burton
was
not
in
one
of
his
best
moods
pomfret
returned
from
his
short
leave
on
the
following
day
and
at
once
sought
his
friend
glad
to
be
back
old
man
got
with
london
he
cried
cheerfully
his
excuse
for
his
visit
was
that
he
had
to
go
up
to
see
his
solicitors
on
some
pressing
affairs
which
the
old
lady
had
entrusted
to
him
after
her
temporary
recovery
from
her
dangerous
illness
now
murchison
was
pretty
quick
he
already
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
jack
had
been
making
a
great
many
surreptitious
visits
to
rosemount
that
hugh
had
been
asked
there
now
and
again
as
a
blind
and
when
he
happened
to
be
present
he
had
noticed
that
jack
and
norah
had
taken
very
little
notice
of
each
other
jack
had
cultivated
the
brother
and
left
his
friend
to
entertain
the
attractive
young
woman
in
itself
this
rather
obvious
attitude
was
suspicious
it
confirmed
his
impression
that
there
was
a
private
understanding
between
the
young
people
and
that
they
were
throwing
dust
in
his
eyes
he
had
already
put
two
and
two
together
with
regard
to
the
concurrent
absences
burton
meeting
him
in
the
high
street
two
days
after
norah
departure
had
told
him
his
sister
was
paying
a
visit
to
a
married
relative
who
lived
at
brighton
he
would
have
not
believed
burton
on
his
oath
and
jack
had
taken
his
few
days
leave
with
the
ostensible
object
of
attending
to
his
aunt
affairs
hugh
was
pretty
certain
that
the
silly
young
ass
as
he
affectionately
designated
jack
in
his
own
mind
had
arranged
to
meet
miss
burton
for
a
day
or
two
in
london
in
order
to
enjoy
her
society
free
from
interruption
or
espionage
of
course
he
was
far
from
guessing
the
truth
he
would
not
have
thought
pomfret
capable
of
any
such
daring
action
jack
had
just
expressed
himself
with
london
and
yet
his
demeanour
was
jubilant
and
hilarious
of
course
hugh
could
not
dream
his
attitude
was
that
of
the
exultant
bridegroom
almost
intoxicated
with
the
knowledge
of
having
gained
his
heart
desire
there
had
been
a
couple
of
lunches
perhaps
a
couple
of
dinners
with
a
theatre
thrown
in
the
buoyant
jack
was
living
on
these
blissful
memories
later
in
the
day
the
two
men
walked
down
the
high
street
of
course
in
accordance
with
a
plan
decided
upon
by
the
artful
lovers
the
first
person
they
met
was
miss
burton
sauntering
along
slowly
miss
burton
now
pomfret
as
fast
as
the
ecclesiastical
law
of
england
could
make
her
she
welcomed
them
with
her
ready
and
charming
smile
what
strangers
we
are
she
cried
gaily
and
how
nice
to
meet
my
only
two
friends
in
blankfield
pomfret
did
a
little
finessing
on
his
own
have
been
away
for
a
few
days
too
he
explained
glibly
had
to
go
up
to
london
to
look
after
some
business
of
my
poor
old
aunt
only
got
back
by
the
train
did
you
enjoy
your
visit
inquired
hugh
of
norah
with
that
stiffness
which
he
could
never
quite
dissociate
from
his
manner
when
addressing
either
brother
or
sister
yes
and
no
was
the
answer
on
the
whole
i
had
quite
a
good
time
but
i
am
not
sorry
to
get
back
to
rosemount
and
my
little
household
gods
knowing
you
both
has
made
such
a
difference
to
my
life
here
she
was
laying
it
on
a
little
bit
thick
hugh
thought
and
he
fancied
she
looked
more
at
pomfret
than
himself
as
she
said
it
but
he
made
a
suitable
and
courteous
reply
she
was
just
about
to
turn
away
when
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
strike
her
as
pomfret
and
i
have
been
such
wanderers
would
it
not
be
nice
to
celebrate
our
return
will
you
both
come
to
dinner
and
we
can
relate
our
experiences
pomfret
jumped
at
the
invitation
and
hugh
had
to
follow
suit
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
rather
eager
to
go
they
were
both
playing
their
parts
very
well
but
he
was
quite
convinced
they
playing
a
part
he
was
more
certain
about
jack
than
about
her
jack
had
been
a
bit
too
glib
had
as
it
were
they
had
met
in
london
if
only
for
a
few
hours
he
would
have
bet
a
thousand
pounds
on
that
jack
declared
that
he
would
walk
back
to
rosemount
with
miss
burton
he
did
not
now
care
a
farthing
what
members
of
society
he
met
very
shortly
the
army
would
know
him
no
more
and
he
would
take
up
a
new
life
with
this
fearless
girl
whom
he
had
married
on
the
sly
hugh
strolled
on
and
looked
in
at
the
various
shops
the
high
street
happened
to
be
rather
empty
on
this
particular
afternoon
the
of
blankfield
society
had
not
yet
turned
out
for
its
usual
promenade
turning
away
from
a
jeweller
shop
window
where
he
was
inspecting
some
he
was
confronted
by
a
tall
sturdily
built
man
of
about
fifty
years
of
age
who
raised
his
hat
i
believe
i
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
captain
murchison
he
inquired
politely
hugh
directed
a
swift
glance
at
him
he
was
not
exactly
a
common
person
on
the
other
hand
he
was
certainly
not
a
gentleman
there
was
something
military
in
his
bearing
he
might
have
been
a
retired
that
is
my
name
answered
hugh
a
little
curtly
and
who
are
you
please
the
tall
man
took
a
card
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
presented
it
those
are
my
credentials
sir
hugh
ran
his
eye
over
it
swiftly
he
saw
the
name
davidson
a
common
one
enough
and
in
the
corner
scotland
yard
why
the
deuce
should
this
agent
of
the
police
want
to
accost
him
and
how
did
he
know
his
name
was
murchison
i
think
you
are
acquainted
with
a
family
of
the
name
of
burton
brother
and
sister
they
call
themselves
who
live
at
a
house
a
little
way
out
called
rosemount
of
course
i
know
them
that
is
to
say
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
needless
to
say
that
murchison
had
never
been
more
surprised
in
his
life
why
are
you
asking
these
questions
davidson
darted
a
keen
glance
up
and
down
the
comparatively
empty
high
street
this
is
rather
an
exposed
place
in
which
to
talk
but
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
i
am
sure
you
will
be
interested
to
listen
to
i
am
staying
at
the
in
a
side
street
from
this
if
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
follow
me
i
can
take
you
into
a
private
room
there
where
we
shall
not
be
observed
nor
overheard
like
a
man
in
a
dream
hugh
found
himself
following
davidson
to
the
anchor
one
of
the
hotels
in
the
town
he
was
quite
sure
that
this
tall
military
looking
person
was
going
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
the
couple
whom
blankfield
in
its
wisdom
had
refused
to
visit
and
whose
acquaintance
he
owed
to
a
random
meeting
at
a
there
were
only
one
or
two
idlers
in
the
of
the
hotel
which
was
of
what
is
known
as
the
commercial
kind
murchison
was
glad
to
find
that
he
did
not
seem
to
attract
their
observation
as
he
rapidly
crossed
over
to
where
his
new
acquaintance
was
standing
in
a
rather
dark
corner
davidson
piloted
him
into
a
little
which
opened
out
of
a
long
narrow
passage
he
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
refreshments
with
the
manner
of
a
man
who
was
acquainted
with
the
usages
of
polite
society
it
would
be
quite
safe
to
say
that
hugh
the
heir
to
a
great
fortune
brought
up
in
the
lap
of
luxury
an
aristocrat
by
adoption
if
not
exactly
by
birth
had
never
found
himself
up
till
now
in
such
an
environment
he
could
not
truthfully
declare
that
it
was
an
experience
he
wished
to
repeat
still
he
could
blame
nobody
but
himself
his
foolish
action
in
taking
up
with
a
couple
of
persons
whom
blankfield
in
its
superior
worldly
wisdom
had
decided
to
ignore
as
he
was
in
for
it
and
nothing
could
undo
the
past
it
was
better
to
go
through
with
it
let
him
accommodate
himself
to
the
situation
drink
his
in
this
dingy
little
parlour
of
a
hotel
and
treat
the
detective
with
genial
courtesy
after
the
first
mouthful
of
his
drink
davidson
began
to
explain
of
course
sir
i
quite
understand
this
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
or
the
sort
of
place
to
which
you
are
accustomed
he
said
waving
a
deprecatory
hand
round
the
shabby
little
parlour
but
in
this
particular
case
i
and
my
friend
that
friend
i
may
say
at
the
moment
is
elsewhere
taking
his
observations
wanted
to
lie
low
it
enter
into
our
scheme
to
put
up
at
a
swagger
hotel
and
run
the
risk
of
gossip
it
might
have
reached
the
ears
of
those
we
are
after
and
scared
them
off
hugh
listened
attentively
there
was
something
very
serious
in
the
wind
now
and
the
dwellers
at
rosemount
were
as
yet
unaware
of
what
was
impending
his
surprise
expressed
itself
in
the
direct
question
which
he
shot
at
the
detective
i
take
it
you
are
here
to
arrest
them
then
one
of
them
the
man
corrected
davidson
quietly
we
know
a
good
deal
about
the
girl
but
we
have
no
evidence
that
implicates
her
beyond
the
fact
of
her
association
with
him
and
from
our
point
of
view
that
means
nothing
in
a
court
of
law
what
is
his
offence
asked
the
startled
hugh
forgery
was
the
laconic
answer
he
belongs
to
a
pretty
gang
and
we
have
had
our
suspicions
of
him
for
a
long
time
now
but
he
was
devilish
clever
and
cunning
several
of
his
pals
were
caught
but
it
was
always
difficult
to
rope
him
in
we
should
have
got
him
now
but
for
the
fact
of
one
of
his
pals
peaching
and
even
now
although
the
evidence
is
strong
enough
for
us
i
doubt
if
it
is
strong
enough
to
get
him
more
than
a
comparatively
light
sentence
if
he
can
lay
hold
of
a
clever
counsel
and
there
will
be
some
money
at
the
back
of
him
if
not
a
great
deal
he
wo
come
off
so
badly
so
burton
was
a
criminal
and
had
been
living
in
blankfield
on
the
proceeds
of
his
nefarious
calling
the
rich
uncle
in
australia
who
had
left
him
a
comfortable
fortune
was
a
myth
i
suppose
he
has
been
on
the
all
his
life
queried
hugh
ever
since
he
has
come
under
our
observation
was
the
reply
of
the
detective
before
he
joined
the
present
gang
a
few
of
whom
we
have
collared
from
time
to
time
was
his
lay
once
he
rented
an
expensive
flat
in
paris
and
i
believe
made
a
tidy
bit
out
of
it
that
is
where
the
young
lady
first
appeared
upon
the
scene
but
how
long
ago
is
that
she
does
look
more
than
twenty
i
know
said
davidson
she
looks
wonderfully
young
that
is
one
of
her
assets
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
should
say
she
was
at
the
least
the
parisian
episode
occurred
about
five
years
ago
making
her
nineteen
at
the
time
he
was
there
about
twelve
months
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
got
an
introduction
to
the
forging
gang
and
chucked
the
cards
in
favour
of
a
more
remunerative
game
she
acted
i
suppose
as
a
decoy
and
confederate
so
i
am
given
to
understand
she
very
seldom
played
herself
but
used
to
signal
the
opponents
cards
to
him
what
a
precious
pair
groaned
hugh
he
had
long
been
doubtful
of
them
but
he
had
never
anticipated
this
now
captain
murchison
there
is
a
little
question
i
want
to
ask
you
said
the
detective
briskly
after
a
brief
pause
my
pal
and
i
only
arrived
here
yesterday
but
we
have
not
been
idle
we
have
picked
up
a
good
deal
we
have
discovered
that
nobody
in
blankfield
visits
them
except
yourself
and
another
officer
a
pomfret
that
is
true
is
it
not
quite
true
assented
murchison
you
frequently
go
to
their
house
together
but
perhaps
i
may
be
telling
you
something
you
do
know
when
i
say
that
pomfret
more
frequently
has
gone
alone
i
have
had
my
suspicions
some
time
was
hugh
answer
now
tell
me
please
i
suppose
in
the
evenings
you
played
cards
or
roulette
or
some
game
of
chance
i
thought
so
did
you
lose
much
had
you
any
suspicions
they
were
rooking
you
on
my
first
visit
a
suspicion
that
they
might
do
so
crossed
my
mind
but
nothing
of
the
sort
was
attempted
i
should
say
that
up
to
the
present
my
friend
and
i
stand
a
bit
to
the
good
evidently
that
was
not
their
object
clearly
assented
the
shrewd
detective
they
had
a
deeper
game
than
that
on
they
wanted
to
catch
this
young
friend
of
yours
for
a
husband
and
failing
that
to
entrap
him
so
that
they
could
blackmail
him
on
the
threat
of
a
breach
of
promise
case
it
looks
as
if
that
was
their
object
now
captain
murchison
may
i
ask
you
if
your
friend
is
a
man
likely
to
fall
into
the
trap
i
saw
him
in
the
high
street
this
afternoon
with
you
and
if
i
may
say
so
without
offence
he
does
give
me
the
impression
of
a
very
strong
or
person
hugh
shook
his
head
i
fear
he
is
very
weak
very
impulsive
very
emotional
a
ready
prey
for
a
designing
woman
have
you
any
idea
how
far
the
thing
has
gone
to
this
question
hugh
could
only
reply
in
the
negative
his
one
hope
was
that
the
foolish
boy
had
seen
her
so
often
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
write
incriminating
letters
well
captain
murchison
my
object
in
asking
you
to
grant
me
an
interview
was
in
the
first
place
i
wanted
to
know
if
there
had
been
any
then
as
i
am
aware
you
go
to
the
house
i
wished
to
tell
you
that
i
and
my
friend
are
going
to
take
him
it
might
happen
that
you
would
be
going
there
and
of
course
you
will
not
want
to
be
on
the
stage
when
we
play
our
little
comedy
we
have
promised
to
go
to
dinner
tonight
she
asked
us
both
when
we
met
her
this
afternoon
and
of
course
now
you
will
not
go
i
will
take
him
before
so
you
need
not
send
round
any
excuses
poor
hugh
felt
very
miserable
what
he
especially
shirked
was
having
to
tell
this
sordid
narrative
to
pomfret
he
expressed
to
the
detective
his
shrinking
from
the
unwelcome
task
i
quite
understand
sir
but
it
got
to
be
done
replied
the
detective
firmly
for
a
few
seconds
after
he
had
spoken
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
then
he
came
out
with
a
startling
proposition
look
here
captain
murchison
something
has
just
occurred
to
me
i
am
not
sure
whether
you
will
think
it
a
good
plan
just
now
i
thought
it
would
be
better
for
you
not
to
be
there
but
if
this
young
gentleman
is
so
gone
on
the
girl
it
might
make
a
deeper
impression
on
him
bring
home
to
him
more
strongly
the
sense
of
her
unworthiness
if
he
were
actually
present
at
the
scene
and
it
would
spare
you
any
painful
explanations
beforehand
afterwards
you
can
tell
him
or
not
as
you
please
about
our
interview
here
hugh
made
a
gesture
of
disgust
you
propose
that
we
should
carry
out
our
original
intention
of
dining
there
and
of
sitting
at
the
table
of
a
criminal
i
do
think
i
could
bring
myself
to
it
if
davidson
did
not
quite
agree
with
the
young
man
scruples
he
was
enough
to
see
the
matter
from
hugh
point
of
view
i
quite
understand
sir
but
i
think
i
can
manage
it
all
right
you
say
they
dine
at
eight
get
there
with
your
friend
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
i
will
be
there
with
my
friend
at
five
minutes
to
before
the
dinner
is
served
you
then
wo
have
to
sit
at
his
table
you
see
hugh
was
still
hesitating
davidson
proceeded
to
clinch
his
argument
you
see
sir
it
will
be
so
much
better
for
pomfret
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
hear
with
his
own
ears
when
he
has
seen
us
clap
the
darbies
on
burton
and
listened
to
what
i
can
tell
him
about
the
girl
you
can
just
give
me
a
lead
there
if
you
do
mind
i
think
he
will
be
cured
of
his
on
the
spot
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
we
want
to
make
a
swift
and
sudden
cure
to
kill
his
affection
at
once
yes
on
the
whole
after
a
little
further
reflection
murchison
was
disposed
to
fall
in
with
this
new
suggestion
pomfret
however
deep
his
infatuation
could
not
resist
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
he
would
be
much
more
strongly
impressed
than
by
a
mere
bald
narration
of
the
facts
as
conveyed
to
his
friend
by
the
detective
so
it
was
settled
hugh
would
bring
pomfret
to
rosemount
at
twenty
minutes
or
a
quarter
to
eight
at
five
minutes
to
davidson
and
his
colleague
would
present
themselves
to
execute
their
painful
errand
just
a
word
before
i
go
said
the
young
man
as
he
turned
towards
the
door
is
the
man
name
really
burton
or
only
an
alias
that
is
his
real
name
of
course
he
has
had
aliases
his
family
i
understand
are
respectable
people
of
the
lower
he
was
the
black
sheep
born
with
crooked
and
criminal
instincts
and
the
girl
is
she
really
his
sister
on
that
point
i
have
no
positive
information
replied
davidson
she
has
passed
as
such
ever
since
the
paris
days
but
i
should
very
much
doubt
it
i
am
informed
that
they
are
very
unlike
in
manners
and
appearance
that
he
is
a
rough
sort
of
fellow
while
she
would
pass
anywhere
for
a
lady
hugh
went
back
to
the
barracks
more
than
rejoiced
at
the
fact
that
the
detective
seemed
to
have
appeared
on
the
scene
in
the
very
nick
of
time
if
marriage
was
contemplated
as
the
result
of
this
clandestine
wooing
what
a
terrible
tragedy
would
be
averted
from
the
unlucky
pomfret
chapter
vii
was
twenty
minutes
to
eight
as
the
two
young
men
rang
at
the
of
rosemount
pomfret
was
always
a
slow
dresser
it
was
only
by
extraordinary
efforts
that
hugh
had
got
him
off
in
time
brother
and
sister
were
awaiting
them
in
the
pretty
lit
with
softly
shaded
lamps
miss
burton
rose
to
meet
them
she
extended
a
hand
to
each
in
her
pretty
graceful
way
as
if
she
looked
upon
them
both
as
her
dearest
friends
and
would
make
no
difference
between
them
in
her
greeting
but
hugh
was
very
after
his
meeting
with
the
detective
and
he
did
notice
that
the
left
hand
which
she
extended
to
pomfret
lingered
a
little
longer
in
his
responsive
clasp
than
did
the
right
which
she
had
given
to
him
yes
it
was
obvious
that
their
acquaintance
had
gone
far
there
was
even
he
fancied
an
intelligent
sympathy
in
their
mutual
glances
pomfret
was
the
lover
hugh
murchison
was
simply
the
friend
burton
welcomed
them
heartily
just
like
old
times
he
cried
in
his
rough
breezy
fashion
i
been
like
a
fish
out
of
water
during
norah
absence
it
was
just
like
her
to
organise
a
little
party
simply
us
four
to
celebrate
her
return
it
struck
hugh
that
his
conviviality
was
just
a
trifle
forced
that
he
seemed
jumpy
and
nervous
had
he
by
chance
spotted
those
two
strangers
in
the
high
street
and
wondered
what
manner
of
men
they
were
pomfret
settled
himself
on
the
chesterfield
beside
norah
in
spite
of
her
rather
obvious
signals
to
preserve
a
more
discreet
attitude
ignorant
of
what
was
going
to
happen
a
few
minutes
hence
her
great
object
was
to
conceal
the
fact
that
jack
should
take
the
position
of
an
acknowledged
lover
in
her
secret
heart
she
was
very
apprehensive
of
murchison
she
knew
he
was
suspicious
of
her
and
he
had
a
sort
of
elder
brother
affection
for
pomfret
she
was
not
by
any
means
sure
as
to
the
lengths
to
which
this
fraternal
feeling
might
lead
him
it
might
even
inspire
him
to
evoke
the
assistance
of
the
pomfret
family
and
then
the
security
of
her
present
position
might
be
menaced
the
secret
marriage
was
after
all
in
the
nature
of
a
gamble
if
things
turned
out
as
she
expected
if
the
old
aunt
died
in
reasonable
time
the
odds
were
in
her
favour
she
could
twist
jack
round
her
little
finger
but
nobody
knew
better
than
this
astute
young
woman
of
the
world
that
there
is
many
a
slip
betwixt
the
cup
and
the
lip
something
that
she
had
not
calculated
not
foreseen
might
happen
at
any
moment
and
her
house
of
cards
might
tumble
to
the
ground
her
adventurous
life
had
taught
her
never
to
be
too
sure
of
momentary
prosperity
she
was
a
little
bit
nervous
and
jumpy
like
her
brother
her
smile
was
a
little
forced
her
high
spirits
rather
assumed
the
the
marriage
certificate
hidden
from
sight
were
great
assets
and
yet
was
it
all
just
a
little
too
good
to
be
quite
true
murchison
talked
with
the
brother
desultory
sort
of
talk
hardly
conscious
of
what
he
was
saying
his
ears
were
straining
for
the
sound
of
that
which
would
herald
the
arrival
of
davidson
and
his
colleague
and
it
came
very
quickly
there
was
a
loud
imperative
peal
burton
started
from
his
seat
and
forgot
his
assumed
good
manners
who
the
devil
is
that
he
cried
fiercely
do
they
want
to
knock
the
house
down
it
was
the
vulgar
exclamation
of
a
very
vulgar
man
miss
burton
was
more
mistress
of
herself
but
hugh
observed
that
her
cheek
went
a
shade
paler
well
it
was
only
natural
these
two
had
been
living
in
fear
of
the
law
for
more
years
than
they
cared
to
remember
and
they
had
thought
they
were
safely
in
harbour
poor
fools
she
turned
to
pomfret
and
forced
a
wan
smile
it
is
really
quite
alarming
pomfret
visitors
at
this
time
of
the
evening
and
you
know
so
well
that
nobody
in
blankfield
except
yourselves
ever
crosses
our
threshold
the
happy
jack
the
husband
of
a
few
short
hours
was
quite
unperturbed
he
smiled
back
at
her
confidently
somebody
come
to
the
wrong
house
i
should
say
why
you
have
gone
quite
pale
what
a
nervous
little
thing
it
is
he
whispered
the
last
sentence
in
a
tone
murchison
felt
every
nerve
in
his
body
tingling
jack
was
in
a
state
of
ignorance
the
brother
and
sister
he
was
sure
were
filled
with
vague
and
undefined
alarms
he
alone
out
of
the
four
sitting
in
that
charming
little
awaiting
the
announcement
of
dinner
was
sure
of
what
was
going
to
happen
he
stole
a
look
across
at
pomfret
with
the
happy
fatuous
smile
of
the
successful
lover
on
his
face
poor
devil
in
another
couple
of
minutes
he
would
be
terribly
disillusioned
there
was
a
heavy
trampling
of
feet
across
the
hall
the
visitors
whoever
they
were
had
pushed
past
the
trim
and
ladylike
parlourmaid
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
two
big
men
davidson
and
his
colleague
advanced
towards
burton
who
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
detective
spoke
in
a
clear
ringing
voice
it
all
up
burton
i
wo
trouble
to
recount
your
various
aliases
i
a
warrant
here
to
arrest
you
on
a
charge
of
forgery
you
gone
free
for
some
time
but
one
of
your
old
pals
has
peached
upon
you
hard
luck
for
you
otherwise
you
might
have
been
playing
still
perhaps
for
ever
this
nice
little
at
blankfield
i
suppose
you
will
come
quietly
for
a
few
seconds
george
burton
indulged
in
some
horrible
imprecations
in
the
same
breath
he
protested
his
absolute
innocence
and
denounced
the
pal
who
had
betrayed
him
davidson
cut
him
short
as
he
fastened
the
handcuffs
on
his
wrist
stow
it
old
man
be
a
sport
it
a
fair
cop
is
it
you
knew
the
risk
you
ran
when
you
went
into
this
business
burton
subsided
yes
it
a
fair
cop
he
growled
i
do
blame
you
you
are
only
doing
your
duty
i
no
grudge
against
you
but
by
heaven
when
i
come
out
i
do
for
that
swine
who
has
given
me
away
if
i
have
to
swing
for
it
pomfret
had
risen
from
his
seat
on
the
chesterfield
at
the
dramatic
entrance
of
the
two
strangers
norah
had
risen
also
in
the
few
seconds
that
elapsed
between
their
entrance
and
the
clapping
of
the
handcuffs
on
burton
she
stretched
out
appealing
arms
to
him
and
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
despair
stand
by
me
jack
stand
by
me
i
knew
nothing
of
this
it
is
as
great
a
surprise
to
me
as
to
you
oh
my
poor
brother
he
has
done
this
for
love
of
me
murchison
heard
the
impassioned
tones
the
despairing
appeal
they
would
have
melted
a
heart
of
stone
what
effect
would
they
have
upon
the
unsuspicious
jack
pomfret
withdrew
himself
almost
coldly
from
the
proffered
embrace
in
a
few
seconds
as
it
seemed
to
hugh
he
had
grown
from
a
boy
to
a
man
he
turned
to
the
detective
and
hugh
was
delighted
at
the
sudden
dignity
that
seemed
to
have
come
to
him
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
about
this
man
whom
you
have
handcuffed
and
who
admits
you
are
only
doing
your
duty
do
you
know
anything
about
his
sister
miss
burton
davidson
glanced
significantly
at
murchison
they
had
arranged
a
little
conversation
between
themselves
but
jack
frankness
had
rendered
this
unnecessary
what
i
know
of
the
young
lady
sir
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
is
not
to
her
credit
she
has
been
associated
with
this
man
for
some
years
she
started
with
him
in
paris
some
time
ago
when
he
was
a
and
running
a
but
to
be
fair
she
is
not
in
this
business
with
him
and
i
have
nothing
against
her
are
they
what
they
represent
themselves
to
be
brother
and
sister
pomfret
voice
was
very
quiet
but
there
was
in
it
a
suppressed
note
of
agony
how
he
had
loved
this
girl
and
a
few
hours
ago
he
had
clasped
her
in
his
arms
as
his
wife
the
keen
eyes
of
the
detective
softened
as
he
looked
at
jack
who
was
hiding
the
most
intense
agitation
under
an
apparently
stoical
demeanour
i
have
no
accurate
information
on
that
point
sir
but
i
should
very
much
doubt
the
fact
of
their
relationship
while
this
brief
conversation
was
taking
place
between
pomfret
and
davidson
norah
was
still
standing
with
arms
outstretched
again
there
came
forth
the
appealing
impassioned
cry
jack
stand
by
me
jack
stand
by
me
she
sank
down
on
the
sofa
and
put
her
hands
before
her
face
stay
with
me
wait
till
they
have
all
gone
and
i
will
explain
everything
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
but
pomfret
stood
like
a
man
turned
to
stone
then
suddenly
norah
gave
a
little
gurgling
cry
and
fainted
pomfret
made
a
step
towards
her
and
halted
his
great
love
for
her
had
been
killed
perhaps
at
this
moment
he
hated
her
more
than
he
had
ever
loved
her
the
with
a
white
face
was
peeping
in
the
room
davidson
beckoned
to
her
my
colleague
will
help
you
to
take
her
up
to
her
room
look
after
her
she
as
game
as
they
make
them
but
t
been
too
much
for
her
she
has
been
playing
for
big
stakes
and
she
has
lost
the
maid
and
davidson
burly
assistant
lifted
up
the
recumbent
form
and
when
they
had
carried
her
out
pomfret
seemed
to
give
way
he
suddenly
clutched
at
his
throat
and
turned
to
hugh
old
man
i
have
had
as
much
as
i
can
stand
for
heaven
sake
take
me
from
this
accursed
house
hugh
put
his
arm
under
his
to
steady
him
the
boy
nerve
had
gone
he
was
trembling
like
a
man
stricken
with
the
ague
there
was
no
cab
or
taxi
to
be
got
in
this
outlying
district
they
had
to
walk
back
to
the
barracks
hugh
planted
him
in
an
in
his
own
quarters
and
mixed
him
a
stiff
peg
even
dutch
courage
was
better
than
nothing
drank
it
in
two
big
gulps
then
he
pulled
himself
together
i
have
been
an
infernal
fool
old
man
he
gasped
an
infernal
fool
hugh
spoke
soothingly
of
course
you
have
but
the
folly
is
over
you
now
know
norah
burton
and
her
rascally
brother
for
what
they
are
a
pair
of
criminals
and
adventurers
but
you
do
know
all
groaned
the
unfortunate
jack
norah
burton
is
my
wife
i
married
her
secretly
the
other
day
by
special
licence
while
i
was
up
in
london
hugh
leapt
to
his
feet
in
astonishment
he
had
his
own
ideas
of
that
visit
to
london
coupled
with
norah
absence
but
that
weak
and
impressionable
as
he
was
should
have
made
such
a
fool
of
himself
was
beyond
the
limits
of
his
comprehension
in
a
moment
he
pulled
himself
together
the
poor
lad
was
in
a
big
mess
enough
it
was
no
time
to
rub
it
in
tell
me
all
about
it
old
chap
he
said
quietly
and
pomfret
told
him
he
made
it
clear
perfect
gentleman
as
he
was
that
norah
had
been
the
least
to
blame
in
the
matter
that
the
suggestion
had
come
from
himself
that
norah
had
insisted
upon
consulting
her
brother
before
yielding
to
his
wishes
yes
of
course
hugh
could
understand
all
that
they
had
known
just
the
kind
of
man
they
were
dealing
with
they
had
hooked
and
landed
their
fish
well
to
a
woman
in
her
uncertain
state
a
husband
with
some
prospects
was
better
than
her
insecure
position
with
a
scoundrel
like
george
burton
hugh
filled
a
big
pipe
full
up
with
a
very
strong
and
potent
tobacco
he
thought
better
when
he
was
smoking
and
this
was
a
situation
that
demanded
a
good
deal
of
thought
after
a
while
he
spoke
well
jack
let
us
look
facts
in
the
face
what
is
done
ca
be
undone
you
have
married
this
woman
and
as
long
as
she
lives
she
is
entitled
to
call
herself
pomfret
and
you
will
have
to
keep
her
there
is
no
getting
over
that
the
unhappy
jack
groaned
there
was
no
getting
over
that
this
attractive
charming
young
woman
sister
or
confederate
or
whatever
relationship
she
stood
in
to
this
wretched
criminal
was
his
legal
wife
and
if
she
chose
she
could
make
things
very
uncomfortable
for
him
well
old
man
you
have
made
a
hash
of
your
life
at
the
very
beginning
of
it
as
i
say
that
ca
be
undone
you
got
to
make
the
best
of
it
i
suppose
you
have
entered
into
some
financial
arrangements
with
her
seven
hundred
a
year
till
i
come
into
my
aunt
money
after
that
of
course
our
marriage
was
to
be
acknowledged
and
we
would
live
together
i
see
said
hugh
assuming
a
cheerfulness
he
did
not
quite
feel
well
i
should
not
say
she
would
try
for
more
than
her
seven
hundred
a
year
at
present
when
your
aunt
dies
she
will
of
course
fight
for
a
bit
more
i
take
it
after
work
you
will
never
want
to
live
with
her
cajoling
and
attractive
as
she
is
pomfret
shuddered
after
what
that
fellow
said
my
love
for
her
died
but
by
heaven
hugh
i
did
love
her
while
i
believed
in
her
of
course
of
course
have
you
signed
any
document
about
that
seven
hundred
by
the
way
not
yet
my
solicitor
is
sending
me
the
document
it
will
reach
me
morning
it
will
make
it
a
little
easier
to
deal
with
her
then
are
you
going
to
leave
yourself
in
my
hands
i
do
think
she
will
be
very
full
of
fight
for
the
next
few
days
certainly
i
will
hugh
do
your
best
for
me
i
never
want
to
see
her
again
of
that
you
may
be
sure
murchison
reflected
deeply
before
he
spoke
again
i
doubt
if
she
will
trouble
you
very
much
it
wo
be
very
difficult
to
compromise
with
her
she
has
too
much
to
hide
and
now
for
yourself
yes
groaned
the
unhappy
pomfret
in
a
hollow
voice
and
now
for
myself
what
do
you
suggest
there
only
one
thing
to
do
and
that
is
to
put
the
past
behind
you
as
long
as
this
woman
lives
you
can
never
marry
but
many
men
go
through
life
and
remain
bachelors
and
are
not
altogether
unhappy
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
be
one
of
the
bachelors
jack
but
jack
looked
very
despairing
the
shock
had
been
a
terrible
one
in
spite
of
the
stiff
peg
he
had
taken
his
face
was
still
livid
and
his
hands
were
shaking
hugh
looked
at
him
anxiously
he
was
very
weak
had
the
occurrences
of
this
terrible
night
driven
him
over
the
border
line
that
separates
sanity
from
insanity
presently
he
muttered
almost
as
if
to
himself
certain
disjointed
phrases
hugh
caught
a
few
of
them
repeated
again
and
again
tied
to
her
for
life
she
will
outlive
me
tied
to
her
for
life
she
will
never
let
me
go
my
poor
family
i
have
always
been
a
fool
but
up
to
now
have
never
brought
disgrace
to
them
and
god
forgive
me
i
was
reckoning
on
the
death
of
my
poor
old
generous
aunt
it
is
idle
to
say
i
did
not
speculate
on
it
and
for
what
for
what
the
pretended
affection
the
bought
kisses
of
this
adventuress
a
decoy
who
told
me
lying
tales
about
the
way
in
which
her
criminal
associate
had
inherited
his
money
he
rambled
on
like
this
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
and
murchison
judged
it
was
better
to
let
him
ease
his
mind
in
such
a
fashion
in
a
way
the
poor
foolish
boy
brain
had
cleared
up
to
a
point
he
was
able
to
look
the
facts
squarely
in
the
face
his
infatuation
might
have
been
so
deep
that
he
might
under
these
damning
circumstances
have
fallen
a
victim
to
her
wiles
a
second
time
she
would
no
doubt
have
been
prepared
if
he
had
given
her
the
opportunity
to
have
sworn
her
innocence
to
have
protested
that
she
was
the
victim
of
circumstantial
evidence
that
she
had
believed
what
her
brother
had
told
her
that
she
had
never
been
a
partner
in
or
a
confidant
of
his
criminal
schemes
no
so
far
the
rude
shock
had
cleared
his
brain
made
him
see
and
think
more
clearly
but
murchison
very
much
feared
that
the
agonising
remorse
for
his
folly
was
obscuring
it
in
another
direction
he
seemed
to
look
upon
himself
as
something
unclean
in
having
allowed
himself
to
be
contaminated
by
association
with
such
a
wretched
adventuress
he
was
also
acutely
conscious
that
at
the
best
he
would
have
to
take
this
horrible
secret
with
him
to
the
grave
unless
it
sprang
suddenly
to
light
as
such
secrets
have
a
knack
of
doing
above
all
he
keenly
felt
the
disgrace
he
had
inflicted
on
his
family
there
was
a
great
deal
more
desultory
talk
and
hugh
gave
him
the
best
advice
he
could
under
the
unhappy
circumstances
a
reiteration
of
the
put
it
behind
you
and
live
it
down
philosophy
this
would
have
come
easy
to
a
man
of
the
rocky
and
stolid
type
to
which
murchison
belonged
by
temperament
but
jack
was
and
impulsive
there
was
no
ballast
in
him
hugh
almost
had
to
push
him
out
of
the
room
but
before
doing
so
he
mixed
the
boy
another
stiff
peg
with
the
hope
that
it
would
induce
sleep
and
purchase
him
the
oblivion
of
a
few
hours
now
then
old
man
toddle
off
get
a
good
night
rest
and
when
you
wake
tomorrow
you
will
find
things
look
pretty
black
but
not
quite
so
black
as
now
if
this
young
woman
contemplates
a
deep
game
and
wants
to
insist
overmuch
on
her
rights
as
your
wife
i
will
deal
with
her
on
your
behalf
i
warrant
i
bring
her
to
reason
the
poor
distraught
boy
clasped
his
friend
hand
convulsively
hugh
old
chap
you
are
the
best
friend
a
man
could
ever
have
true
as
steel
do
say
that
replied
hugh
with
a
little
break
in
his
voice
i
am
bound
to
do
the
best
for
you
it
was
owing
to
my
infernal
folly
that
you
ever
set
foot
in
that
cursed
house
i
am
older
and
stronger
than
you
i
ought
to
have
known
better
well
good
old
jack
i
tell
you
things
wo
look
quite
as
black
but
to
hugh
intense
grief
and
remorse
there
was
no
morrow
for
the
unhappy
boy
whose
mind
had
been
quite
unhinged
by
the
events
of
that
terrible
night
one
could
only
surmise
that
he
had
found
sleep
impossible
and
in
a
fit
of
frenzy
had
taken
his
life
to
escape
from
a
future
so
black
and
discouraging
when
his
servant
went
to
call
him
in
the
morning
he
found
his
master
lying
on
the
floor
with
a
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
everybody
in
the
barracks
had
been
fast
asleep
when
the
poor
boy
had
fired
the
shot
that
was
to
take
him
out
of
his
troubles
and
nobody
had
heard
the
report
at
the
inquest
the
whole
miserable
story
came
out
of
course
it
came
through
hugh
the
only
person
who
was
in
possession
of
it
he
narrated
the
details
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
burtons
the
introduction
of
jack
pomfret
to
the
house
the
scene
at
rosemount
when
the
two
detectives
had
taken
the
man
jack
confession
that
he
had
made
the
girl
his
wife
a
few
hours
previously
hugh
never
forgot
that
interview
with
the
colonel
in
which
old
fireworks
poured
out
his
wrath
in
no
measured
terms
he
roundly
called
him
an
infernal
fool
for
mixing
himself
up
with
people
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
and
whom
blankfield
in
its
ignorance
of
their
antecedents
had
declined
to
visit
and
very
wisely
if
it
had
been
poor
jack
a
dear
lad
but
a
foolish
i
could
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
forgive
him
he
ended
but
you
are
a
man
of
another
sort
you
have
got
your
wits
about
you
if
you
choose
to
exercise
them
i
will
never
pardon
you
that
day
work
you
can
play
with
fire
and
not
be
scorched
but
he
could
that
poor
boy
death
lies
at
your
door
sir
i
hope
you
realise
it
yes
hugh
did
realise
it
he
stood
with
bowed
head
and
could
not
utter
a
word
in
the
news
of
course
was
all
over
the
town
the
next
morning
or
rather
the
double
news
that
george
burton
had
been
arrested
by
two
detectives
from
scotland
yard
and
that
in
the
early
morning
of
the
following
day
jack
pomfret
had
blown
out
his
brains
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
explained
the
double
event
the
news
of
her
young
husband
suicide
reached
norah
early
in
the
morning
she
had
gambled
and
lost
the
old
adventurous
life
was
in
front
of
her
again
she
took
the
buffets
of
fate
with
the
stoicism
of
her
kind
and
class
she
had
a
comfortable
little
put
by
which
stood
between
her
and
present
want
if
only
jack
had
been
less
emotional
she
would
not
have
troubled
him
much
been
content
with
quite
a
little
it
is
to
be
feared
that
in
her
bitter
disappointment
she
felt
a
little
sore
against
jack
for
his
moral
cowardice
in
getting
comfortably
out
of
it
himself
and
leaving
her
in
the
lurch
anyway
she
faced
the
situation
with
a
courage
that
one
could
not
refuse
to
admire
by
two
that
same
day
the
servants
had
been
paid
their
wages
the
keys
of
the
furnished
house
handed
over
to
the
agent
and
pomfret
had
departed
for
london
murchison
could
never
forget
that
terrible
time
till
something
came
that
seemed
to
dwarf
all
other
things
in
august
nineteen
hundred
and
fourteen
there
burst
the
first
storm
of
the
war
which
shook
the
world
to
its
centre
in
the
plains
of
france
he
forgot
everything
except
his
country
jack
pomfret
and
norah
burton
seemed
dim
memories
in
those
strenuous
times
of
the
world
upheaval
and
yet
when
he
had
a
moment
leisure
to
think
of
the
past
he
felt
a
savage
longing
to
be
even
with
that
smiling
adventuress
who
had
driven
his
poor
young
friend
to
a
suicide
grave
chapter
viii
a
good
proposition
old
man
you
could
employ
a
couple
of
hours
better
i
have
been
in
london
society
of
all
sorts
for
the
best
part
of
my
life
and
i
tell
you
that
stella
keane
is
the
most
charming
girl
i
have
ever
met
the
speaker
was
little
tommy
esmond
short
genial
and
rotund
of
person
tommy
knew
everybody
who
was
anybody
and
everybody
knew
the
mercurial
tommy
guy
spencer
puffed
leisurely
at
his
cigar
and
regarded
his
rotund
little
friend
with
an
amused
smile
spencer
was
about
thirty
tommy
was
old
enough
to
be
his
father
but
he
wore
well
most
excellent
tommy
how
many
times
have
i
heard
you
say
the
same
thing
every
girl
you
come
across
is
the
most
charming
you
have
ever
met
until
one
sees
you
the
next
week
and
then
the
last
girl
has
the
like
the
young
lady
you
just
mentioned
miss
stella
keane
but
esmond
was
not
to
be
rebuffed
by
a
clumsy
attempt
at
humour
on
the
part
of
a
young
man
so
much
his
junior
besides
tommy
was
impervious
to
humour
it
fell
off
him
like
water
from
a
duck
back
in
his
way
he
was
a
very
strenuous
little
man
he
had
no
time
to
frivol
do
try
to
be
funny
old
man
it
does
suit
you
be
sensible
and
come
round
with
me
to
flat
and
be
introduced
to
miss
keane
it
an
interesting
suggestion
tommy
but
before
i
decide
tell
me
first
who
is
and
secondly
who
and
what
is
miss
keane
and
tommy
esmond
launched
forth
on
a
full
flow
of
narrative
was
the
first
cousin
of
a
irish
earl
and
was
well
in
somewhat
reduced
circumstances
and
had
a
snug
little
flat
in
the
cadogan
district
is
quite
satisfactorily
explained
remarked
guy
interrupting
his
rather
voluble
friend
now
what
do
you
really
know
about
miss
keane
here
esmond
was
a
little
less
precise
he
knew
quite
well
had
known
her
ever
since
he
had
been
in
london
her
ancestry
and
connections
were
unimpeachable
miss
keane
it
would
appear
had
been
suddenly
projected
into
the
household
as
it
were
from
space
he
understood
that
she
was
a
distant
connection
a
cousin
but
he
could
give
no
particulars
tommy
with
the
born
instinct
of
the
true
diplomatist
was
always
ready
to
present
everything
in
its
best
light
but
he
lacked
the
one
essential
quality
of
the
born
diplomatist
he
was
not
very
successful
when
he
came
to
camouflaging
facts
spencer
smile
was
more
amused
than
ever
as
he
regarded
his
genial
friend
spencer
was
only
thirty
and
tommy
was
at
least
old
enough
to
be
his
father
but
there
were
times
when
the
younger
man
thought
he
saw
more
clearly
than
the
elder
let
us
put
it
at
this
tommy
being
in
somewhat
straitened
circumstances
supplements
her
meagre
income
by
at
which
i
have
no
doubt
she
is
an
adept
and
here
the
usually
placid
tommy
interposed
hotly
you
may
say
of
what
you
like
but
if
you
propose
to
offer
any
derogatory
remarks
about
miss
keane
i
would
rather
not
listen
to
them
and
spencer
kept
a
curb
on
his
tongue
was
this
fat
little
man
a
most
unromantic
figure
violently
in
love
with
miss
stella
keane
and
her
sworn
champion
far
be
it
from
him
to
disturb
his
faith
in
this
seductive
siren
if
it
were
so
it
all
right
old
chap
he
said
quietly
i
am
not
going
to
make
any
remarks
derogatory
or
otherwise
about
miss
keane
i
think
i
will
adopt
your
suggestion
let
us
adjourn
to
flat
if
one
loses
fifty
or
a
hundred
one
may
have
a
good
time
you
will
see
the
most
charming
girl
in
london
cried
esmond
in
enthusiastic
tones
it
struck
spencer
as
a
peculiar
phase
of
his
t
friend
detachment
that
being
in
love
with
the
girl
himself
he
should
be
so
anxious
to
introduce
her
to
a
younger
man
who
might
presumably
be
his
rival
for
there
could
be
no
question
of
rivalry
between
the
two
men
apart
from
their
ages
spencer
was
tall
athletic
handsome
tommy
esmond
was
just
tommy
esmond
rotund
comical
in
appearance
and
insignificant
moreover
spencer
had
other
qualifications
which
are
not
without
their
influence
on
the
fair
sex
he
had
a
considerable
fortune
and
he
was
the
next
in
succession
to
an
ancient
earldom
if
the
earl
of
southleigh
a
widower
did
not
marry
again
he
would
succeed
to
the
title
and
estates
he
was
in
every
sense
of
the
term
an
eligible
the
long
weary
war
was
drawing
to
its
close
the
two
men
were
dining
at
the
fashionable
excelsior
and
were
now
about
through
their
dinner
spencer
had
the
bearing
of
a
soldier
and
he
would
have
been
at
the
front
long
ago
but
no
doctor
could
be
found
who
would
pass
him
to
all
appearance
he
possessed
the
thews
and
sinews
of
an
athlete
but
the
stalwart
manly
frame
covered
an
incurably
weak
heart
which
played
him
strange
tricks
at
times
he
was
serving
his
country
in
the
best
way
open
to
him
and
doing
good
sound
clerical
work
in
a
government
office
when
do
you
suggest
we
should
put
in
an
appearance
at
mrs
he
asked
presently
it
will
take
us
another
to
get
through
this
abundant
meal
you
will
then
have
your
coffee
and
you
will
want
a
good
and
long
cigar
we
began
rather
late
you
will
remember
by
the
time
you
have
got
through
your
smoke
we
will
make
a
move
we
shall
then
find
them
in
full
swing
guy
nodded
and
went
on
with
his
dinner
he
was
quite
willing
to
go
to
the
flat
he
had
no
other
engagement
this
evening
and
it
would
be
something
to
do
but
he
was
not
greatly
interested
about
meeting
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
london
in
spite
of
his
almost
lyrical
outbursts
he
expected
that
miss
stella
keane
would
prove
a
very
ordinary
young
woman
suddenly
tommy
esmond
uttered
an
exclamation
look
there
they
are
he
whispered
excitedly
across
the
table
and
her
cousin
the
man
with
them
is
colonel
desmond
the
man
who
won
the
victoria
cross
in
the
boer
war
tommy
round
face
was
red
with
pleasurable
emotion
was
there
any
doubt
thought
spencer
that
the
little
man
was
tremendously
smitten
by
the
beautiful
miss
keane
would
it
result
in
a
marriage
he
wondered
tommy
was
and
a
person
of
some
importance
in
his
little
social
world
and
if
miss
keane
was
as
lovely
as
his
fond
imagination
painted
her
it
was
quite
evident
that
she
was
poor
penniless
young
girls
have
before
now
accepted
the
shelter
of
a
safe
home
even
when
offered
by
little
elderly
men
the
three
newcomers
moved
to
a
vacant
table
a
woman
of
middle
age
dressed
rather
more
youthfully
than
was
quite
in
good
taste
their
escort
a
tall
figure
in
khaki
very
upright
and
soldierly
in
his
bearing
in
spite
of
his
sixty
years
and
last
but
by
no
means
least
the
beautiful
miss
keane
yes
at
the
first
glance
the
young
man
decided
that
she
fully
deserved
his
friend
somewhat
extravagant
praise
if
everybody
in
london
was
not
raving
over
her
it
was
simply
due
to
the
fact
that
her
cousin
circle
was
not
important
and
that
she
had
found
nobody
of
sufficient
social
influence
to
launch
her
with
the
necessary
if
she
had
made
her
at
one
of
the
great
houses
stamped
with
the
approval
of
any
one
of
london
distinguished
hostesses
society
journals
would
have
gone
into
rhapsodies
over
her
and
she
would
have
been
one
of
the
reigning
beauties
of
the
hour
far
far
beyond
the
aspirations
of
little
tommy
esmond
his
own
special
taste
rather
inclined
towards
fair
women
his
cousin
lady
nina
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
being
a
charming
specimen
of
that
type
but
he
was
no
bigot
in
the
matter
of
feminine
beauty
and
he
was
prepared
to
admit
that
there
were
some
dark
women
who
could
compare
favourably
with
their
blonde
sisters
but
stella
keane
was
not
very
dark
she
had
soft
brown
eyes
glossy
dark
hair
and
a
beautiful
creamy
complexion
a
mouth
like
cupid
bow
revealing
when
she
smiled
teeth
of
a
dazzling
ivory
her
figure
would
have
been
pronounced
perfect
by
the
most
critical
and
fastidious
artist
what
do
you
think
of
her
asked
the
delighted
tommy
after
he
had
given
his
friend
a
decent
time
for
his
inspection
tommy
was
a
man
whose
friends
had
got
into
the
habit
of
smiling
at
him
even
when
they
agreed
with
him
spencer
smiled
at
him
quite
as
often
as
any
of
his
acquaintance
but
at
this
moment
he
was
perfectly
grave
you
are
quite
right
old
man
this
time
he
said
quietly
she
is
really
beautiful
and
her
carriage
is
splendid
she
looks
like
a
young
empress
or
rather
she
fulfils
one
idea
of
what
a
young
empress
should
be
tommy
beamed
he
drank
in
the
words
of
unstinted
praise
like
wine
the
little
blue
eyes
usually
devoid
of
expression
seemed
suffused
with
a
soft
emotion
there
was
something
pathetic
in
his
devotion
to
this
radiant
young
woman
who
looked
like
a
youthful
empress
and
she
is
as
good
and
sweet
as
she
looks
he
murmured
in
a
voice
that
he
could
not
keep
steady
when
she
talks
to
you
seriously
and
lets
you
know
what
she
really
thinks
and
feels
by
gad
spencer
it
makes
a
battered
old
worldling
like
myself
feel
unworthy
to
be
in
her
presence
for
she
has
a
beautiful
soul
and
mind
as
well
as
a
beautiful
body
spencer
could
only
look
sympathetic
poor
little
tommy
he
certainly
seemed
to
talk
like
a
lover
and
what
did
miss
keane
think
of
it
all
she
must
have
more
than
a
mere
tolerance
for
him
or
she
would
not
have
allowed
him
those
peeps
into
her
mind
and
soul
to
which
he
alluded
with
such
unrestrained
rapture
it
was
some
time
before
esmond
intense
gaze
attracted
the
attention
of
the
party
and
when
it
did
he
was
rewarded
with
a
most
affable
smile
from
and
one
of
quite
pronounced
friendliness
from
miss
keane
the
colonel
also
bestowed
a
genial
nod
after
a
pause
tommy
spoke
somewhat
ruefully
i
afraid
this
rather
upsets
our
little
plans
is
a
most
conscientious
diner
she
will
be
here
at
the
lowest
calculation
for
an
hour
and
a
half
counting
the
coffee
and
cigarettes
they
wo
be
back
at
the
flat
under
a
couple
you
would
care
to
wait
so
long
he
looked
rather
wistfully
at
his
companion
he
for
his
own
part
would
have
waited
half
the
night
do
let
us
commit
ourselves
old
man
but
await
events
we
finished
our
dinner
yet
and
the
service
is
deucedly
slow
we
can
put
in
a
lot
more
time
you
can
pay
your
respects
at
a
fitting
moment
and
perhaps
they
will
ask
us
to
their
table
i
must
confess
i
should
like
to
see
miss
keane
at
closer
quarters
and
talk
to
her
although
i
expect
she
will
reveal
as
much
to
me
as
she
does
to
you
tommy
looked
pleased
again
he
was
very
bent
upon
introducing
spencer
to
his
beautiful
young
friend
it
would
come
about
presently
if
not
here
in
the
lounge
already
had
sent
a
few
covert
glances
in
the
direction
of
their
table
there
was
little
doubt
she
knew
who
his
companion
was
and
would
be
quite
pleased
to
number
him
amongst
her
acquaintance
has
miss
keane
many
admirers
she
should
have
remarked
spencer
presently
he
noticed
that
esmond
eyes
were
always
turned
in
the
direction
of
that
particular
table
not
any
serious
ones
i
fancy
a
few
young
fellows
send
her
flowers
but
nothing
more
it
is
quite
an
unsuitable
for
a
girl
of
her
attractions
the
majority
of
the
are
men
who
go
there
simply
to
gamble
the
few
young
ones
come
for
a
flutter
and
disappear
when
they
have
had
enough
does
the
young
lady
play
i
have
never
seen
her
she
has
told
me
scores
of
times
that
she
loathes
gambling
her
father
ruined
himself
by
it
i
believe
she
is
really
very
unhappy
there
and
i
gather
has
not
the
best
of
tempers
particularly
when
she
has
had
bad
luck
hobson
choice
i
expect
suggested
spencer
sympathetically
miss
keane
was
facing
him
giving
him
ample
opportunity
to
examine
the
beautiful
countenance
and
it
struck
him
that
there
was
an
underlying
expression
of
sadness
on
the
perfect
features
especially
when
in
repose
i
fear
so
was
esmond
answer
she
is
very
reticent
about
her
own
affairs
as
any
gentlewoman
would
be
but
from
certain
things
she
has
let
drop
i
make
out
her
own
means
are
very
slender
and
her
hospitality
is
a
boon
to
her
half
an
hour
passed
and
spencer
lit
a
big
cigar
the
two
men
chatted
on
various
topics
and
the
colonel
were
still
doing
full
justice
to
the
excellent
dishes
offered
them
miss
keane
was
apparently
satisfied
and
sat
quietly
watching
her
companions
and
throwing
in
an
occasional
remark
and
suddenly
came
the
loud
sound
of
maroons
everybody
started
a
few
seconds
later
the
clamour
and
roaring
of
our
own
guns
burst
forth
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
what
was
happening
the
germans
were
making
one
of
their
unwelcome
visits
by
heavens
it
a
raid
and
we
are
in
the
thick
of
it
cried
tommy
esmond
rising
excitedly
he
was
a
nervous
little
man
and
his
face
had
grown
a
shade
pale
at
the
sound
of
the
first
boom
in
a
few
moments
there
was
a
stampede
from
the
the
guests
hurried
as
fast
as
they
could
to
the
basement
and
cellars
tommy
in
his
progress
was
impeded
by
two
burly
men
who
were
making
their
way
leisurely
spencer
was
a
few
feet
in
front
of
him
making
for
the
crowd
that
surged
round
the
doors
as
he
looked
around
the
deserted
tables
he
saw
miss
keane
standing
alone
her
eyes
almost
rigid
with
terror
her
hands
clutching
convulsively
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
it
was
evident
that
the
colonel
had
quickly
removed
from
the
scene
of
danger
and
she
had
been
too
to
follow
them
he
crossed
over
to
her
excuse
me
he
said
gently
i
am
a
friend
of
esmond
how
is
it
you
are
alone
did
your
companions
desert
you
colonel
desmond
took
my
cousin
and
told
me
to
keep
close
behind
them
when
i
got
up
my
limbs
seemed
unable
to
move
i
feel
as
if
i
were
paralysed
he
took
her
arm
and
put
it
through
his
it
was
evident
she
had
been
rendered
immobile
by
terror
i
will
take
care
of
you
he
said
soothingly
downstairs
you
will
be
quite
safe
but
we
will
let
this
crowd
get
through
first
tommy
esmond
came
bustling
up
all
anxiety
truth
to
tell
he
did
not
feel
over
brave
but
his
anxiety
for
himself
was
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
her
white
face
and
stricken
eyes
slowly
cheered
by
the
presence
of
the
two
men
a
little
colour
flowed
back
into
her
cheeks
and
she
smiled
wanly
i
am
a
fearful
coward
she
explained
i
go
all
to
pieces
in
even
the
mildest
thunderstorm
and
it
was
in
this
wise
amid
the
crash
of
falling
bombs
and
the
roar
and
clamour
of
our
own
guns
that
guy
spencer
made
the
acquaintance
of
stella
keane
chapter
ix
found
shelter
in
one
of
the
big
cellars
of
the
restaurant
and
miss
keane
by
degrees
got
back
some
of
her
courage
there
were
about
twenty
other
persons
in
the
same
refuge
and
she
probably
derived
fortitude
from
their
temporary
companionship
and
common
danger
tommy
esmond
recovered
himself
very
quickly
and
hastened
to
observe
the
conventions
it
is
a
queer
time
and
place
in
which
to
make
introductions
he
remarked
genially
but
even
in
times
of
peril
one
should
preserve
the
usages
of
good
society
i
do
suppose
you
know
the
name
of
your
gallant
rescuer
let
me
make
you
known
in
a
formal
fashion
spencer
miss
keane
the
beautiful
stella
bowed
her
dark
head
and
the
ghost
of
a
smile
flitted
over
her
still
pale
face
i
know
spencer
very
well
by
sight
when
i
have
recovered
my
wits
i
will
thank
him
properly
and
prettily
perhaps
he
will
come
and
see
us
at
my
cousin
flat
i
was
bringing
him
on
there
as
a
matter
of
fact
explained
esmond
but
i
presume
all
that
is
knocked
on
the
head
even
supposing
we
get
out
of
this
disgusting
hole
in
reasonable
time
wo
be
in
a
mood
to
receive
visitors
after
this
disquieting
experience
i
am
sure
i
am
afraid
you
do
know
replied
the
girl
with
a
little
mocking
laugh
her
tones
were
not
yet
quite
steady
but
she
was
rapidly
recovering
herself
the
card
tables
were
laid
before
we
started
and
we
intended
to
be
back
early
if
we
get
out
safely
from
this
disgusting
hole
as
you
call
it
my
cousin
will
resume
her
ordinary
pursuits
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
disturb
them
desultory
conversation
the
irresponsible
chatter
of
the
kind
was
almost
impossible
under
the
circumstances
and
although
miss
keane
did
her
best
to
assume
a
brave
front
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
inwardly
quivering
at
every
roar
of
the
guns
she
shivered
all
over
and
her
cheek
alternately
flushed
and
then
grew
deadly
pale
with
her
inward
terror
poor
child
whispered
spencer
to
his
companion
she
must
be
a
bundle
of
nerves
every
second
she
is
experiencing
the
pangs
of
death
in
anticipation
by
the
way
the
gallant
desmond
does
seem
to
have
troubled
himself
much
about
her
if
i
had
taken
her
forcibly
away
i
believe
she
would
be
rooted
to
that
chair
now
esmond
shrugged
his
shoulders
of
course
a
chap
like
desmond
know
the
meaning
of
fear
and
he
ca
understand
the
sensation
in
others
the
other
woman
took
possession
of
him
and
dragged
him
away
no
doubt
he
thought
she
was
following
so
far
as
i
can
judge
would
never
think
of
anything
but
number
one
and
as
spencer
glance
stole
to
the
fair
face
he
felt
a
strange
feeling
of
pity
for
her
the
poignant
happenings
of
the
last
few
moments
had
revealed
to
him
her
loneliness
the
tragedy
of
her
dependence
upon
others
in
a
supreme
moment
of
peril
she
who
ought
to
have
lovers
and
friends
by
the
score
was
left
by
herself
and
thrown
upon
the
compassion
of
a
stranger
an
anxious
passed
and
then
messengers
came
down
with
tidings
of
a
reassuring
nature
the
raiders
had
been
driven
off
after
inflicting
considerable
damage
gay
london
was
free
to
pursue
its
natural
course
of
pleasure
at
once
the
tension
was
relaxed
drooping
forms
resumed
an
erect
carriage
the
roses
bloomed
again
in
the
pale
cheeks
of
the
women
there
was
a
flutter
a
stir
they
all
moved
away
from
the
refuge
which
had
been
so
welcome
and
now
had
become
unbearable
in
the
hall
they
encountered
the
colonel
cool
and
collected
as
if
he
were
on
parade
fluttering
and
full
of
protestations
oh
my
poor
stella
i
have
been
distracted
about
you
why
did
you
not
follow
us
i
thought
you
were
close
behind
us
all
the
time
till
we
got
to
one
of
these
abominable
cellars
and
looked
back
to
find
you
were
missing
the
colonel
pulled
at
his
moustache
a
little
nervously
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
miss
keane
not
to
have
assured
myself
you
were
with
us
at
the
start
i
would
have
come
back
to
search
for
you
but
was
in
such
a
nervous
state
i
could
not
leave
her
miss
keane
answered
him
very
coldly
and
to
her
cousin
she
did
not
vouchsafe
any
reply
please
do
not
apologise
it
was
a
question
of
qui
fortunately
i
found
some
kind
friends
who
took
compassion
on
a
forlorn
damsel
shaking
and
she
turned
to
esmond
is
of
course
an
old
friend
but
you
do
not
know
spencer
who
got
to
me
first
was
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
she
extended
her
hand
with
an
air
of
effusive
cordiality
a
thousand
thanks
to
you
both
my
darling
stella
was
fortunate
in
finding
such
protectors
we
are
both
terrible
cowards
i
do
know
which
is
the
greater
i
without
question
flashed
out
miss
keane
otherwise
i
should
have
had
the
sense
to
scurry
away
like
yourself
we
were
both
frightened
rabbits
but
you
could
run
to
a
place
of
safety
while
i
stood
paralysed
turned
away
the
awkward
thrust
with
a
charming
smile
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
one
thing
she
remarked
with
an
air
of
conviction
never
so
long
as
the
war
lasts
will
i
dine
out
of
my
own
home
this
night
experience
has
taught
me
a
lesson
i
do
want
a
second
one
at
this
juncture
tommy
esmond
interposed
i
was
going
to
bring
my
friend
spencer
round
to
you
but
i
suppose
you
feel
a
bit
too
shattered
eh
you
would
like
to
get
home
and
rest
oh
dear
no
replied
the
lady
vivaciously
i
never
alter
my
habits
for
anything
or
anybody
let
us
all
go
along
at
once
i
will
go
with
colonel
desmond
you
and
spencer
can
continue
your
charge
of
stella
but
guy
had
a
small
duty
to
perform
i
think
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
join
you
a
little
later
i
want
to
go
round
to
inquire
after
my
uncle
and
cousin
he
is
a
very
old
man
and
i
should
like
to
know
he
is
quite
safe
so
it
was
arranged
the
others
drove
off
to
flat
and
spencer
finding
he
would
have
some
time
to
wait
for
a
taxi
walked
to
carlton
house
terrace
where
lord
had
his
town
house
the
footman
who
opened
the
door
informed
him
that
his
lordship
and
lady
nina
were
still
in
the
with
a
small
party
the
earl
had
taken
it
all
very
calmly
and
his
daughter
who
unlike
poor
stella
keane
was
a
young
woman
of
remarkable
courage
had
not
been
disturbed
at
all
are
they
alone
robert
no
sir
two
old
friends
of
his
lordship
came
to
dinner
and
are
still
with
them
but
of
course
they
will
be
glad
to
see
you
however
his
duty
being
performed
and
learning
that
all
was
satisfactory
spencer
thought
he
might
as
well
get
along
to
the
flat
he
had
been
strangely
attracted
by
the
beautiful
girl
whom
even
her
obvious
terror
and
lack
of
could
not
deprive
of
her
charm
no
i
wo
come
in
tell
them
i
called
round
to
make
sure
they
were
all
safe
and
say
to
her
ladyship
i
will
look
in
afternoon
about
he
went
into
his
club
for
a
few
moments
to
see
if
there
were
any
letters
and
half
an
hour
later
was
at
door
she
occupied
the
first
floor
of
an
imposing
block
of
flats
recently
erected
in
one
of
the
quarters
of
london
she
might
not
be
in
very
affluent
circumstances
as
esmond
had
hinted
but
she
would
have
to
pay
a
very
handsome
rent
for
her
abode
the
door
was
opened
by
a
butler
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
served
in
good
families
a
man
passed
out
as
spencer
entered
he
was
a
young
fellow
of
about
in
khaki
spencer
knew
him
well
by
sight
as
the
eldest
son
and
heir
of
a
rich
brewer
his
face
did
not
wear
a
very
happy
expression
it
did
not
require
a
sherlock
holmes
to
surmise
that
his
visit
had
been
an
expensive
one
and
that
he
was
hurrying
away
to
avoid
further
temptation
in
the
centre
of
a
rather
spacious
hall
stella
keane
and
tommy
esmond
stood
chatting
she
greeted
the
newcomer
with
a
bright
and
friendly
smile
she
no
longer
looked
pale
in
fact
he
thought
there
was
a
slight
suspicion
of
rouge
on
the
fair
cheeks
she
was
too
goodlooking
to
need
the
aid
of
art
but
perhaps
she
wanted
to
conceal
the
ravages
inflicted
on
her
beauty
by
that
terrible
time
at
the
excelsior
you
are
not
very
long
after
us
i
conclude
you
found
your
friends
were
quite
safe
she
had
gathered
from
the
garrulous
tommy
what
she
had
not
known
before
that
spencer
was
next
in
succession
to
the
earldom
also
that
lord
southleigh
had
a
very
pretty
daughter
who
was
an
accomplished
young
sportswoman
a
daring
rider
to
hounds
an
adept
at
golf
fishing
and
other
pastimes
of
a
strenuous
nature
she
had
pricked
up
her
ears
at
mention
of
the
cousin
artfully
she
pumped
tommy
as
to
whether
there
was
any
tender
feeling
between
the
relatives
but
tommy
could
give
no
information
on
this
point
spencer
was
a
very
reticent
man
about
his
private
affairs
he
explained
personally
he
should
not
consider
him
particularly
susceptible
to
female
influence
but
he
had
heard
that
the
old
earl
who
had
a
shockingly
weak
heart
and
was
likely
to
go
off
at
any
moment
would
have
viewed
a
marriage
between
the
cousins
with
favour
she
mused
over
his
words
he
did
not
think
him
particularly
susceptible
to
female
influence
and
yet
she
was
sure
there
was
admiration
open
undisguised
admiration
in
the
glances
he
had
bestowed
upon
her
he
was
evidently
not
deeply
in
love
with
his
pretty
sporting
cousin
or
she
would
have
been
mrs
guy
spencer
before
now
assuming
of
course
that
she
was
ready
to
obey
her
father
wishes
it
was
after
a
short
silence
that
miss
keane
put
a
somewhat
abrupt
question
to
him
are
you
fond
of
play
spencer
everybody
is
who
comes
here
not
really
i
am
a
very
lukewarm
gambler
i
do
mind
a
little
flutter
now
and
then
as
a
diversion
i
always
enjoy
a
small
gamble
at
monte
carlo
for
example
but
i
never
get
carried
away
when
i
have
lost
enough
i
stop
nothing
could
induce
me
to
stake
another
can
you
stop
as
easily
when
you
are
winning
that
i
fancy
is
where
the
selfcontrol
comes
in
but
i
think
i
am
rather
glad
you
are
not
one
of
the
infatuated
ones
i
was
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
gambling
there
was
a
pathetic
shadow
in
the
beautiful
brown
eyes
as
she
spoke
spencer
interest
in
her
a
girl
he
had
only
known
for
a
couple
of
hours
quickened
the
glance
he
turned
on
her
was
full
of
sympathy
although
he
did
not
utter
a
word
it
said
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
spoken
tell
me
more
about
yourself
you
will
find
an
attentive
listener
my
father
and
mother
were
both
desperate
gamblers
they
staked
and
lost
everything
they
had
at
cards
on
the
at
monte
carlo
my
poor
cousin
has
the
same
fever
in
her
veins
now
that
he
had
invited
her
confidence
he
was
a
little
embarrassed
by
it
he
did
not
know
her
well
enough
to
condole
with
her
by
way
of
relieving
the
tension
he
uttered
a
few
trite
remarks
on
the
subject
of
gambling
generally
very
sad
when
people
are
bitten
by
it
to
that
extent
in
my
small
experience
and
i
am
only
speaking
of
cards
i
have
found
that
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
you
leave
off
pretty
well
where
you
started
good
players
or
bad
you
lose
a
hundred
this
week
you
win
a
hundred
the
next
and
so
on
and
so
forth
if
you
are
a
good
player
you
get
bad
cards
if
a
duffer
you
get
good
cards
and
so
the
bad
player
has
a
pretty
even
chance
with
his
more
skilful
opponent
miss
keane
threw
aside
her
momentary
sadness
and
laughed
at
his
scientific
exposition
you
have
evidently
thought
it
all
out
she
said
brightly
but
please
do
inflict
these
cheerful
theories
on
my
cousin
she
is
a
most
tragic
being
when
she
loses
she
thinks
herself
and
i
believe
is
one
of
the
most
scientific
in
england
and
she
can
not
be
brought
to
understand
why
the
duffers
should
have
a
look
in
at
this
juncture
tommy
esmond
interposed
it
may
have
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
wasting
precious
time
they
had
come
here
for
the
special
purpose
of
gambling
what
do
you
say
to
joining
the
others
we
are
in
the
very
temple
of
gambling
and
i
know
my
young
friend
would
like
a
little
flutter
certainly
when
i
last
peeped
in
amy
looked
the
spirit
of
despair
i
think
she
must
have
been
losing
heavily
she
turned
to
lead
the
way
but
at
that
instant
the
rang
and
she
halted
in
readiness
to
greet
the
visitor
whoever
it
might
be
and
there
entered
a
stout
man
who
advanced
towards
her
with
effusion
and
both
hands
outstretched
my
dear
stella
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
ever
since
the
raid
began
i
know
how
terribly
you
suffer
when
they
are
on
and
i
knew
you
were
dining
out
i
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
safe
and
sound
i
came
round
here
the
moment
i
could
get
away
miss
keane
flushed
slightly
as
he
took
her
hands
and
wrung
them
impressively
to
show
his
gratitude
at
her
escape
from
peril
tommy
esmond
had
given
him
a
cool
nod
but
she
felt
spencer
calm
critical
gaze
upon
this
ebullient
expression
of
young
english
manhood
it
was
not
so
much
what
he
said
as
his
manner
of
saying
it
bounder
was
written
all
over
him
in
his
appearance
his
manners
his
gestures
she
answered
him
very
briefly
almost
curtly
as
if
she
were
administering
a
cold
douche
then
the
flush
deepened
as
she
turned
to
spencer
may
i
introduce
my
cousin
mr
dutton
the
florid
man
bowed
with
an
exaggerated
air
of
cordiality
spencer
who
had
taken
a
violent
dislike
to
him
from
the
first
second
he
saw
him
acknowledged
the
salutation
with
chilling
gravity
and
stella
keane
could
almost
read
his
thoughts
as
his
gaze
travelled
from
one
to
the
other
how
could
this
girl
have
such
an
unmitigated
bounder
for
a
relative
what
was
the
mystery
about
her
that
could
make
a
creature
like
this
claim
kinship
with
her
chapter
x
was
evidently
a
great
believer
in
light
the
electric
bulbs
glowed
softly
but
brilliantly
over
the
two
rooms
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
on
the
sideboards
were
arranged
decanters
of
whisky
and
in
bottles
and
syphons
whether
he
lost
or
won
the
gambler
triumphant
or
despairing
could
quaff
to
his
success
or
solace
his
despair
the
elderly
woman
advanced
towards
the
new
visitors
with
a
beaming
expression
of
countenance
spencer
you
will
join
us
what
is
your
favourite
game
bridge
said
spencer
shortly
he
was
already
a
bit
in
love
with
stella
keane
but
he
was
by
no
means
favourably
inclined
to
her
gushing
elderly
cousin
he
soon
formed
a
party
of
four
and
became
absorbed
for
the
moment
in
the
game
tommy
esmond
was
playing
the
same
game
at
a
table
some
distance
from
him
tommy
was
not
supposed
to
be
wealthy
but
he
evidently
had
money
enough
to
indulge
in
a
quiet
gamble
now
and
then
he
remembered
every
incident
of
that
night
his
partner
was
a
subordinate
member
of
the
government
and
a
good
sound
player
lacking
a
little
perhaps
in
the
qualities
of
initiative
and
rapid
decision
his
opponents
were
a
young
man
in
the
foreign
office
and
a
slender
young
woman
of
about
thirty
all
through
he
held
abominable
cards
but
truth
to
tell
he
was
not
very
interested
in
the
game
whether
he
won
or
lost
a
hundred
pounds
did
not
interest
him
very
greatly
but
what
did
interest
him
to
every
fibre
of
his
being
was
that
stella
keane
hovered
about
his
table
his
eyes
continually
sought
hers
and
she
did
not
seem
to
avoid
his
glance
at
times
he
was
sure
he
could
detect
a
slight
smile
of
intimacy
after
all
had
he
not
rescued
her
half
dead
with
fright
in
the
of
the
excelsior
once
she
bent
over
him
and
whispered
her
cool
fragrant
breath
fanning
his
cheek
you
are
having
shocking
bad
luck
you
have
held
a
single
decent
card
he
whispered
back
what
did
i
tell
you
a
little
time
ago
i
flatter
myself
i
am
a
fairly
good
but
what
could
one
do
with
those
cards
of
mine
she
fluttered
away
with
still
the
shadow
of
that
intimate
smile
upon
her
beautiful
mouth
the
smile
that
seemed
to
say
they
had
only
known
each
other
for
a
few
hours
under
romantic
and
dramatic
circumstances
but
there
was
between
them
an
affinity
of
spirit
he
played
on
steadily
for
over
an
hour
and
then
a
halt
was
cried
the
young
gentleman
from
the
foreign
office
and
the
hawknosed
young
woman
had
scored
guy
spencer
rose
from
the
table
the
poorer
by
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
he
wrote
his
cheque
with
a
light
heart
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
was
not
a
great
price
to
pay
for
the
introduction
to
stella
keane
came
impressively
towards
him
oh
spencer
i
hope
you
have
not
lost
if
so
i
fear
you
will
never
come
near
me
again
his
glance
roved
in
the
direction
of
stella
talking
as
it
appeared
earnestly
to
that
bounder
of
a
cousin
there
came
a
steely
look
into
his
clear
resolute
eyes
if
you
will
allow
me
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
here
often
to
see
you
and
miss
keane
i
suppose
i
had
better
pick
up
my
old
friend
tommy
esmond
if
he
is
not
too
engrossed
but
when
he
approached
esmond
that
little
rotund
gentleman
waved
him
away
in
most
genial
fashion
run
away
dear
boy
it
is
eclipse
first
and
the
rest
nowhere
i
am
winning
hands
down
certainly
he
bore
the
mien
of
a
conqueror
and
there
behind
his
chair
stood
stella
keane
she
welcomed
spencer
with
that
faint
intimate
smile
which
had
already
stirred
his
pulses
i
fear
i
brought
you
bad
luck
she
said
in
her
low
caressing
voice
but
to
esmond
i
have
been
the
harbinger
of
good
fortune
are
you
really
going
i
always
go
when
i
have
won
enough
or
lost
enough
you
remember
i
gave
you
a
little
homily
on
gambling
generally
not
so
long
ago
she
took
her
hand
off
esmond
chair
well
i
will
leave
my
good
influence
behind
and
look
after
the
parting
guest
she
walked
leisurely
with
him
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
it
was
deserted
but
the
light
was
brilliant
as
it
was
in
every
other
corner
of
the
flat
she
held
out
her
hand
impulsively
spencer
i
have
not
thanked
you
properly
for
your
kindness
to
me
paralysed
with
fear
i
should
have
been
clinging
to
that
chair
now
if
you
had
not
rescued
me
in
time
how
can
i
thank
you
spencer
laughed
lightly
one
would
think
from
your
excessive
gratitude
that
you
had
not
experienced
a
great
deal
of
kindness
in
your
life
and
yet
that
would
be
impossible
she
flushed
a
little
his
gaze
was
perhaps
more
full
of
admiration
of
frank
and
open
compliment
than
could
be
justified
by
the
briefness
of
their
acquaintance
and
yet
it
only
expressed
what
he
was
inwardly
thinking
here
was
a
girl
who
had
only
to
look
at
her
mirror
to
learn
she
was
endowed
with
singular
beauty
she
must
also
know
that
she
combined
with
her
more
than
ordinary
fairness
an
unusual
charm
of
manner
how
had
it
come
about
that
one
with
such
striking
qualifications
should
exhibit
a
certain
underlying
sadness
as
if
the
world
had
already
proved
a
very
disappointing
place
youth
and
good
looks
usually
secure
for
their
owner
a
good
time
girls
with
half
her
attractions
could
find
plenty
of
admirers
what
evil
fate
dogged
her
that
she
had
to
regard
a
perfectly
common
act
of
kindness
as
something
to
be
exceptionally
grateful
for
i
have
never
been
petted
nor
spoiled
even
as
a
child
she
answered
gravely
my
father
and
mother
were
ignorant
of
the
duties
as
they
were
of
the
instincts
of
parenthood
and
since
my
poor
pretence
of
a
home
was
broken
up
i
have
been
a
derelict
and
a
wanderer
sometimes
a
tolerated
guest
rarely
i
fear
a
very
welcome
one
in
the
houses
of
other
people
but
you
are
happy
here
surely
he
suggested
after
saying
so
much
she
could
hardly
regard
the
question
as
an
impertinent
one
he
longed
to
hear
her
history
well
if
he
came
and
cultivated
her
and
let
her
see
how
sympathetic
he
could
be
one
day
she
would
tell
him
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
an
air
of
indifference
my
cousin
is
peculiar
in
many
ways
and
her
devotion
to
play
is
an
obsession
we
have
very
little
in
common
still
it
would
not
be
fair
to
say
she
was
difficult
to
get
on
with
i
have
been
with
her
now
for
more
than
eighteen
months
and
although
we
have
often
held
totally
different
opinions
i
can
not
remember
that
we
have
ever
had
a
real
quarrel
and
anyway
it
is
a
home
and
a
shelter
and
that
is
something
not
much
enthusiasm
here
certainly
had
been
dismissed
with
a
very
negative
kind
of
faint
praise
her
excellence
seemed
to
lie
rather
in
the
absence
of
bad
qualities
than
the
possession
of
good
ones
and
yet
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
miss
keane
was
an
girl
or
of
an
unresponsive
temperament
he
had
to
admit
that
his
impressions
of
his
hostess
were
not
too
favourable
she
was
outwardly
genial
and
at
times
gushing
yet
he
fancied
he
could
read
behind
this
plausible
exterior
the
signs
of
a
hard
worldly
nature
there
was
no
softness
in
her
glance
no
tenderness
in
her
rather
hard
staccato
tones
a
girl
with
those
glorious
eyes
and
mobile
face
with
the
delicate
complexion
that
flushed
and
paled
by
turns
must
surely
be
sweet
and
sympathetic
and
responsive
to
affection
how
her
voice
had
thrilled
with
emotion
when
she
thanked
him
if
she
was
disappointed
in
her
cousin
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
elder
woman
who
could
not
give
what
was
demanded
by
the
younger
and
more
ardent
temperament
he
would
have
lingered
longer
trying
to
pierce
the
riddle
from
these
disjointed
remarks
but
they
were
interrupted
by
tommy
esmond
who
came
bustling
into
the
hall
flushed
with
victory
never
had
such
luck
in
my
life
just
wiped
the
floor
with
them
he
explained
excitedly
you
left
your
good
influence
behind
miss
keane
a
few
minutes
sufficed
for
victory
i
am
very
glad
but
i
think
my
powers
for
good
must
be
very
limited
for
i
brought
bad
luck
to
your
friend
was
her
smiling
rejoinder
he
turned
briskly
to
the
young
man
it
is
a
perfect
night
spencer
shall
we
walk
down
to
the
club
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
turn
in
there
for
a
quiet
smoke
spencer
nodded
assent
and
held
out
his
hand
to
miss
keane
well
for
the
present
and
i
hope
you
will
come
and
see
us
again
soon
do
wait
for
esmond
to
bring
you
after
our
thrilling
experiences
of
tonight
we
are
more
than
ordinary
acquaintances
we
are
at
home
nearly
every
night
if
you
want
to
gamble
and
if
you
would
like
a
little
rational
chat
instead
come
in
one
afternoon
to
tea
thanks
i
will
my
fit
has
passed
for
a
little
time
once
again
goodbye
and
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
street
esmond
burst
in
with
the
question
he
was
longing
to
ask
well
what
do
you
think
of
her
did
i
exaggerate
not
in
the
least
answered
spencer
speaking
less
seriously
than
he
felt
he
did
not
quite
know
for
what
reason
unless
it
was
that
with
a
man
of
his
friend
calibre
he
always
had
a
tendency
to
discuss
things
lightly
no
i
do
think
you
have
exaggerated
a
bit
this
time
so
many
of
your
swans
have
been
geese
but
this
is
a
real
swan
at
last
she
is
very
lovely
even
in
her
terror
she
looked
beautiful
and
she
has
a
peculiar
elusive
charm
she
makes
you
want
to
know
more
of
her
and
penetrate
the
mystery
which
seems
to
hover
around
i
ca
say
i
see
any
mystery
myself
esmond
spoke
rather
sharply
for
such
a
little
man
perhaps
it
is
too
strong
a
word
but
i
take
it
you
know
something
of
the
ménage
and
can
enlighten
me
on
one
point
what
is
her
position
there
paid
companion
a
passing
guest
or
does
she
share
the
flat
with
her
cousin
on
some
sort
of
terms
it
was
a
little
time
before
esmond
answered
i
have
never
rightly
got
at
that
myself
sometimes
i
have
thought
one
thing
sometimes
another
but
i
am
pretty
sure
she
is
poor
in
fact
she
has
admitted
as
much
poverty
is
relative
after
all
and
it
depends
on
how
she
was
brought
up
she
seems
to
dress
well
and
that
can
not
be
done
without
money
yes
esmond
admitted
that
she
was
turned
out
well
but
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
express
any
positive
opinion
upon
the
delicate
subject
of
miss
keane
finances
does
she
ever
play
she
did
touch
a
card
while
we
were
there
only
flitted
about
from
table
to
table
no
esmond
had
never
seen
her
play
since
he
had
frequented
the
house
it
was
clear
therefore
she
did
not
make
any
out
of
gambling
he
had
to
admit
that
she
seemed
to
act
as
deputy
hostess
and
he
believed
wrote
most
of
her
cousin
notes
in
other
words
made
herself
useful
all
this
information
such
as
it
was
he
imparted
as
it
seemed
to
spencer
with
some
reluctance
perhaps
his
keen
admiration
prompted
him
to
hide
anything
that
served
to
show
her
in
a
dependent
position
and
spencer
desisted
from
any
further
crossexamination
on
this
head
on
one
point
however
he
was
determined
to
elicit
a
positive
expression
of
opinion
from
the
cautious
little
man
what
is
the
mystery
of
the
bounder
cousin
you
must
admit
he
has
cad
stamped
all
over
him
his
speech
his
person
his
gestures
tommy
could
establish
no
defence
for
the
gentleman
in
question
no
he
is
past
criticism
i
allow
the
result
of
some
i
suppose
his
mother
a
very
common
person
doubtless
but
then
many
highly
respectable
people
have
skeletons
like
that
in
their
cupboards
the
mystery
is
that
he
finds
his
way
cousin
as
he
may
be
into
any
decent
house
we
know
to
be
a
woman
of
good
family
you
would
think
she
would
lock
and
bolt
the
door
against
a
creature
like
that
what
is
he
supposed
to
be
if
he
has
any
profession
beyond
that
of
his
intense
bounderism
something
in
the
city
i
am
told
replied
esmond
shortly
something
connected
with
finance
stockbroker
or
something
it
must
be
a
shady
kind
of
finance
if
he
has
anything
to
do
with
it
growled
the
young
man
to
think
of
his
claiming
relationship
with
that
exquisite
girl
chapter
xi
would
be
idle
to
assume
that
a
man
of
guy
spencer
natural
advantages
had
reached
the
age
of
thirty
without
experiencing
a
few
affairs
of
the
heart
but
he
had
never
been
deeply
touched
and
his
friend
tommy
esmond
was
right
when
he
described
him
as
not
very
susceptible
to
feminine
influence
the
one
feeling
which
had
lasted
for
some
years
was
a
pronounced
affection
for
his
cousin
nina
he
felt
as
much
at
home
with
her
as
he
would
have
done
with
a
favourite
sister
had
he
possessed
one
but
the
regard
had
a
warmth
in
it
that
is
lacking
in
fraternal
relations
he
knew
that
lady
nina
was
not
indifferent
to
him
that
she
allowed
him
to
assume
a
certain
air
of
proprietorship
in
the
disposal
of
dances
in
the
claim
to
her
society
when
he
was
disposed
to
enjoy
it
he
knew
also
that
it
was
a
match
which
would
be
warmly
approved
of
by
his
invalid
uncle
without
being
guilty
of
undue
vanity
he
felt
pretty
certain
that
if
he
proposed
he
would
be
accepted
and
once
or
twice
he
had
been
very
near
to
taking
the
decisive
step
he
never
could
quite
understand
what
it
was
that
made
him
hesitate
the
fact
of
his
hesitation
proved
to
himself
as
well
as
to
the
young
lady
concerned
that
much
as
he
might
like
his
cousin
he
was
certainly
far
from
being
deeply
in
love
with
her
she
was
a
pretty
winsome
girl
possessing
an
upright
straightforward
nature
and
quite
attractive
in
a
simple
frank
fashion
there
was
nothing
subtle
or
mysterious
about
her
you
could
read
her
like
an
open
book
she
was
a
good
daughter
she
was
the
type
of
girl
who
could
not
help
making
a
good
wife
some
day
no
doubt
he
would
put
the
fateful
question
and
by
her
acceptance
be
made
in
conventional
parlance
the
happiest
of
men
but
although
he
would
know
he
had
chosen
very
wisely
and
look
forward
to
a
placid
kind
of
happiness
he
was
doubtful
if
nina
smiles
and
kisses
would
ever
thrill
him
if
with
her
he
would
ever
learn
the
meaning
of
real
love
he
was
not
by
any
means
sure
that
he
was
capable
of
very
strong
attachment
he
had
indulged
in
a
few
fancies
but
they
had
only
exercised
a
very
small
portion
of
his
thoughts
up
to
the
present
he
had
certainly
not
experienced
the
wild
ecstasies
the
mingled
joy
and
pain
of
the
true
lover
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
seriously
perturbed
by
the
advent
of
stella
keane
he
had
not
fashioned
in
his
imagination
any
particular
ideal
any
special
type
of
woman
who
would
make
to
him
an
irresistible
appeal
but
if
she
had
been
lady
nina
if
he
had
met
her
in
his
own
world
he
would
have
owned
at
once
this
was
the
girl
for
whom
he
had
been
waiting
her
image
pursued
him
persistently
in
his
waking
and
his
leisure
hours
he
could
recall
every
word
she
had
spoken
during
the
short
time
they
had
spent
together
he
could
see
her
a
dozen
times
a
day
standing
in
the
excelsior
paralysed
with
terror
he
remembered
the
break
in
her
voice
the
mist
in
her
beautiful
eyes
when
she
had
thanked
him
and
ever
and
again
he
longed
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
her
loneliness
the
cause
of
that
sadness
that
was
always
lurking
underneath
was
it
wise
to
pursue
the
acquaintance
with
the
pretty
certain
result
of
intensifying
the
interest
he
already
felt
in
her
he
had
no
liking
for
a
woman
merely
on
the
fringe
of
his
world
or
her
gambling
circle
if
he
wanted
to
lose
or
win
money
there
were
plenty
of
other
houses
where
he
could
indulge
his
fancy
and
he
knew
nothing
of
miss
keane
antecedents
the
only
thing
he
did
know
was
that
she
had
a
cousin
who
was
obviously
a
bounder
of
the
first
water
tommy
esmond
knew
nothing
about
her
either
or
if
he
did
know
would
not
tell
for
three
days
he
wavered
one
moment
eager
to
rush
off
to
the
flat
the
next
determining
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
renew
the
brief
acquaintance
on
the
fourth
day
his
impulse
conquered
his
prudence
he
told
himself
soothingly
that
his
visit
was
due
to
curiosity
that
he
merely
wanted
to
penetrate
the
mystery
of
her
loneliness
her
unprotected
position
the
bounder
cousin
was
coming
out
as
he
entered
dutton
nodded
affably
to
him
with
a
greasy
and
familiar
smile
spencer
acknowledged
him
in
the
coolest
fashion
compatible
with
bare
civility
why
were
there
people
he
wondered
whom
you
instinctively
wanted
to
kick
for
no
apparently
sufficient
reason
miss
keane
was
alone
she
explained
was
in
bed
with
a
racking
headache
she
had
lost
heavily
the
night
before
and
this
was
the
usual
penalty
she
paid
for
losing
hardly
worth
the
candle
is
it
he
said
lightly
as
he
took
his
cup
of
tea
from
her
a
slight
frown
crossed
his
brow
as
he
observed
the
empty
cup
of
the
bounder
on
the
table
did
he
come
here
often
was
his
thought
perhaps
he
was
in
love
with
her
but
it
was
surely
beyond
the
limits
of
possibility
that
she
could
ever
return
the
affection
of
such
a
creature
he
would
see
what
he
could
get
out
of
her
i
met
your
cousin
as
i
came
in
i
suppose
he
is
a
frequent
visitor
she
did
not
look
in
the
least
conscious
or
embarrassed
by
the
question
oh
yes
he
comes
very
often
he
is
about
the
only
one
of
my
relatives
i
have
any
acquaintance
with
my
father
mode
of
life
estranged
all
the
others
spencer
thought
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
if
dutton
had
been
as
sensitive
to
the
disqualifications
of
the
late
keane
as
the
rest
of
her
connections
but
of
course
he
could
not
say
so
he
is
not
in
the
least
like
you
then
after
a
pause
he
added
boldly
and
perhaps
a
little
rudely
i
should
never
have
dreamed
you
were
related
she
quite
understood
what
he
meant
and
there
was
a
lurking
humour
in
her
smile
as
she
answered
poor
old
george
he
is
a
good
sort
but
quite
a
rough
diamond
his
mother
married
a
man
of
course
for
his
money
that
may
account
for
a
great
deal
you
have
noticed
spencer
had
the
grace
to
look
confused
it
was
evident
he
had
conveyed
his
private
impression
of
dutton
very
distinctly
to
her
clear
young
vision
but
she
did
not
seem
offended
only
slightly
amused
at
the
poor
figure
cut
by
cousin
george
in
the
estimation
of
a
person
in
a
superior
world
anyway
that
little
mystery
was
explained
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
poor
gentlewomen
marrying
men
for
the
sake
of
money
the
noble
family
of
southleigh
had
many
such
amongst
its
aristocratic
records
but
it
was
a
relief
to
find
stella
herself
under
no
delusions
concerning
the
young
man
in
question
he
did
not
think
it
possible
she
could
but
as
diplomatically
as
was
possible
she
admitted
that
dutton
was
not
what
is
technically
called
a
gentleman
he
is
the
only
relative
with
whom
i
am
on
speaking
terms
she
added
after
a
pause
for
reasons
of
which
i
have
already
given
you
a
hint
and
i
think
i
have
grown
rather
to
look
forward
to
his
visits
her
observant
eyes
noticed
a
quick
stiffening
in
his
manner
she
could
guess
his
thoughts
how
was
it
possible
for
a
refined
young
woman
to
ever
look
forward
to
the
visits
of
a
person
like
dutton
cousin
though
he
might
be
you
of
course
have
heaps
of
relations
you
can
pick
and
choose
she
went
on
as
if
eager
to
explain
to
his
fastidious
taste
her
toleration
of
a
man
so
obviously
the
denizen
of
an
inferior
world
you
can
not
i
daresay
imagine
the
loneliness
of
a
girl
of
my
age
debarred
through
no
fault
of
her
own
from
the
society
of
her
own
kith
and
kin
here
was
an
opportunity
to
engage
her
in
personal
talk
he
had
not
hoped
she
would
take
him
into
her
confidence
on
his
first
visit
he
leaned
forward
and
there
was
an
eager
note
in
his
voice
i
formed
an
idea
of
you
in
the
first
few
moments
of
our
acquaintance
that
you
were
not
happy
that
you
were
in
a
sense
isolated
and
that
you
had
known
more
of
sorrow
than
joy
in
your
short
life
she
mused
a
moment
and
then
answered
him
in
grave
tones
you
were
quite
right
i
feel
it
is
the
impression
i
must
convey
to
either
friend
or
stranger
an
impression
i
shall
always
convey
for
if
a
great
and
overwhelming
happiness
were
to
come
to
me
i
could
never
forget
the
past
years
of
sadness
but
surely
you
must
have
some
happy
memories
there
were
gleams
of
brightness
in
your
childhood
no
she
said
and
there
was
a
fierce
vehemence
in
her
voice
they
were
the
most
miserable
an
indifferent
mother
a
careless
father
a
roof
and
a
shelter
food
and
clothing
sufficient
if
not
in
abundance
but
no
home
as
it
is
understood
by
more
fortunate
children
and
when
that
home
or
the
wretched
pretence
of
it
was
broken
up
you
were
thrown
upon
the
mercy
of
the
world
he
questioned
with
no
kindred
no
friends
to
stretch
out
a
helping
hand
our
relatives
had
long
before
ceased
to
take
any
interest
in
the
daughter
of
a
ruined
gambler
i
was
thrown
in
a
certain
sense
on
the
mercy
of
the
world
but
for
a
small
pittance
which
my
father
could
not
deprive
me
of
i
should
have
starved
for
he
left
nothing
behind
him
but
debts
she
was
not
then
absolutely
penniless
something
had
been
saved
from
the
wreck
he
wondered
if
esmond
knew
this
and
yet
if
she
told
a
comparative
stranger
this
at
their
first
real
interview
she
must
have
told
him
who
seemed
to
be
on
the
footing
of
a
friend
of
the
house
i
had
no
real
friends
she
went
on
but
in
the
course
of
a
wandering
life
when
my
father
owed
too
much
in
one
place
he
removed
to
another
i
had
picked
up
a
few
acquaintances
with
these
i
made
a
home
on
and
off
for
longer
or
shorter
periods
and
you
have
come
to
anchor
here
with
who
is
your
cousin
one
of
the
few
relatives
who
did
not
visit
the
sins
of
the
fathers
on
the
children
her
voice
was
a
little
scornful
the
cousinship
is
a
very
distant
one
and
as
she
is
an
inveterate
gambler
herself
but
more
lucky
than
my
father
she
could
hardly
look
upon
gambling
in
another
as
a
deadly
sin
he
nodded
his
head
in
agreement
he
did
not
want
to
talk
himself
for
fear
he
should
interrupt
the
flow
of
her
reminiscences
she
was
evidently
in
a
confidential
mood
this
afternoon
i
saw
her
a
few
times
when
quite
a
child
and
then
she
vanished
like
the
others
a
couple
of
years
ago
we
met
in
devonshire
at
the
house
of
a
mutual
acquaintance
she
seemed
to
take
a
fancy
to
me
in
the
end
she
proposed
that
i
should
for
the
present
make
my
home
with
her
she
has
only
one
interest
in
life
she
is
a
very
lazy
woman
she
hates
writing
the
briefest
note
and
housekeeping
is
abhorrent
to
her
i
attend
to
her
correspondence
i
order
the
dinner
and
look
after
the
servants
i
am
not
exactly
eating
the
bread
of
charity
she
concluded
with
a
little
mirthless
laugh
because
i
give
some
work
in
exchange
for
my
food
my
own
little
pittance
provides
me
with
clothes
he
wondered
what
the
little
pittance
represented
in
annual
hard
cash
she
was
dressed
quietly
but
in
good
taste
and
he
was
judge
enough
of
woman
apparel
to
know
that
the
material
of
her
dress
was
expensive
on
her
slender
fingers
glittered
a
few
valuable
rings
heirlooms
probably
saved
from
the
clutches
of
the
gambling
father
she
did
not
convey
the
impression
of
poverty
but
perhaps
she
was
clever
and
knew
how
to
make
the
best
of
a
small
income
there
was
a
long
silence
and
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
had
forgotten
his
presence
for
she
sat
with
a
musing
look
in
her
beautiful
eyes
her
thoughts
evidently
in
the
past
conjuring
up
heaven
knows
how
many
painful
memories
then
she
came
back
to
herself
and
turned
to
him
with
an
apologetic
smile
i
am
afraid
i
have
bored
you
to
tears
with
my
stupid
personal
history
but
i
will
finish
by
telling
you
one
little
thing
that
may
amuse
you
he
protested
of
course
that
he
had
not
been
in
the
least
bored
only
too
painfully
interested
well
i
am
not
a
person
easily
crushed
and
although
a
physical
coward
and
frightened
of
raids
and
thunderstorms
i
am
not
a
moral
one
when
i
began
to
review
my
position
i
tried
to
hit
upon
some
way
of
making
money
was
she
fond
of
money
he
wondered
well
perhaps
like
most
women
she
wanted
money
to
buy
herself
pretty
things
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
that
when
i
was
a
schoolgirl
i
was
supposed
to
show
some
artistic
talent
i
got
several
prizes
so
i
set
to
work
and
painted
some
small
things
in
what
i
conceived
to
be
a
popular
style
and
took
them
round
to
as
many
dealers
in
a
week
my
hopes
were
shattered
one
straightforward
creature
told
me
frankly
that
they
just
attained
the
level
of
excellence
but
that
i
should
never
become
an
artist
it
was
not
in
me
a
crushing
blow
indeed
said
spencer
sympathetically
i
then
turned
to
writing
here
at
any
rate
was
a
profession
that
required
no
previous
painful
training
only
powers
of
observation
some
imagination
and
a
certain
fluency
of
expression
i
wrote
some
short
stories
which
i
thought
good
which
i
still
think
good
history
repeated
itself
i
sent
them
to
a
dozen
editors
one
after
another
in
every
case
they
were
declined
with
thanks
i
daresay
they
were
quite
good
and
they
were
not
taken
because
you
did
happen
to
be
in
the
ring
was
spencer
consoling
comment
well
she
exclaimed
brightly
there
is
an
end
of
my
reminiscences
for
let
us
talk
of
anything
and
everything
else
have
you
seen
esmond
lately
he
has
not
been
near
us
since
the
night
he
came
with
you
shortly
afterwards
he
took
his
leave
he
had
stayed
unconsciously
long
as
it
was
i
shall
come
again
soon
if
i
may
to
listen
to
some
more
reminiscences
he
said
as
he
shook
hands
and
she
had
given
him
permission
with
the
brightest
of
smiles
he
had
not
learned
half
as
much
as
he
wanted
but
he
had
gathered
something
the
bounder
cousin
was
the
son
of
a
man
a
and
stella
keane
was
not
absolutely
penniless
she
had
enough
money
to
buy
herself
clothes
did
tommy
esmond
know
as
much
as
this
and
if
he
did
why
had
he
not
said
so
chapter
xii
unsuspicious
by
nature
guy
spencer
had
mixed
much
in
the
world
and
seen
a
good
deal
of
life
attracted
as
he
was
by
the
charming
stella
there
was
a
something
about
the
atmosphere
of
that
flat
in
elsinore
gardens
which
created
an
unfavourable
impression
of
antecedents
there
was
no
question
she
was
a
woman
of
good
family
she
could
produce
chapter
and
verse
for
her
ancestors
and
yet
why
was
she
not
in
a
better
environment
clearly
she
was
on
the
downward
slope
but
was
there
anything
remarkable
in
that
heaps
of
members
of
aristocratic
families
were
in
the
same
sort
of
predicament
from
various
causes
through
certain
circumstances
had
he
not
received
a
letter
a
few
days
ago
from
the
daughter
of
a
earl
imploring
him
for
a
loan
of
ten
pounds
for
the
sake
of
old
friendship
the
writer
was
some
twenty
years
his
senior
and
she
had
tipped
him
when
he
was
at
eton
she
now
dated
her
letter
from
a
suburb
in
the
extreme
west
of
kensington
if
she
with
all
her
advantages
of
birth
and
connection
had
fallen
by
the
wayside
why
not
a
comparatively
obscure
person
like
it
was
very
easy
to
see
it
was
of
a
bohemian
temperament
and
probably
a
great
spendthrift
she
had
made
considerable
inroads
into
whatever
fortune
she
originally
possessed
and
had
developed
into
an
adept
with
a
view
to
supplementing
the
little
income
that
was
left
to
her
and
stella
keane
that
beautiful
sad
girl
with
the
tragic
history
of
worthless
parents
behind
her
was
the
victim
of
fate
she
was
not
happy
in
her
cousin
home
amidst
this
gambling
set
she
at
least
was
pure
whoever
else
might
be
defiled
on
that
he
would
stake
his
existence
for
a
few
days
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
subject
and
during
those
few
days
he
kept
away
from
elsinore
gardens
and
denied
himself
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
a
further
instalment
of
miss
reminiscences
of
her
unhappy
history
if
he
were
going
to
fall
in
love
he
told
himself
sternly
he
would
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
of
his
own
world
not
with
a
girl
however
beautiful
and
interesting
she
might
be
who
was
only
a
of
a
woman
but
evidently
a
woman
no
longer
moving
in
the
sphere
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
in
these
reflections
he
showed
sound
sense
but
for
a
certain
event
that
happened
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
he
might
have
adhered
to
his
good
resolutions
and
have
finally
dismissed
miss
keane
from
his
serious
thoughts
and
in
that
case
this
story
would
not
have
been
written
and
then
the
event
happened
returning
home
to
his
rooms
one
night
about
twelve
his
man
told
him
that
esmond
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
he
found
the
little
rotund
man
sitting
in
an
the
marks
of
agitation
written
all
over
his
countenance
wondering
at
this
unusual
spectacle
tommy
was
frequently
fussy
but
always
spencer
advanced
and
held
out
his
hand
what
up
tommy
you
a
late
visitor
but
always
welcome
he
pointed
to
the
decanters
standing
on
the
sideboard
i
hope
you
have
helped
yourself
to
spencer
great
surprise
the
little
man
did
not
take
the
proffered
hand
he
spoke
in
a
hoarse
choking
voice
his
lips
twitching
i
helped
myself
once
too
often
spencer
and
i
ca
take
the
hand
of
an
honest
man
for
reasons
you
got
it
at
once
spencer
had
average
brains
but
he
was
not
very
quick
to
realise
the
meaning
of
unexpected
situations
at
first
he
thought
the
little
man
had
been
drinking
sit
down
tommy
and
get
it
off
your
chest
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
is
the
matter
he
said
kindly
he
was
rather
fond
of
tommy
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
esmond
did
not
sit
down
at
once
but
went
over
to
the
sideboard
and
mixed
himself
a
stiff
tumbler
of
he
gulped
it
down
at
a
draught
and
then
took
an
armchair
you
wo
begrudge
me
that
i
know
he
said
speaking
in
the
same
strained
hoarse
voice
it
the
last
drink
i
have
in
your
rooms
the
last
drink
in
any
house
in
england
i
should
say
i
done
for
old
man
tomorrow
i
clear
out
eat
my
heart
away
in
some
beastly
foreign
hole
no
spencer
first
surmise
had
been
incorrect
the
man
was
not
drunk
not
even
elevated
his
face
was
and
he
was
trembling
all
over
as
if
he
had
been
stricken
with
palsy
but
he
was
perfectly
sober
spencer
took
a
chair
himself
and
spoke
a
little
sternly
pull
yourself
together
old
man
and
speak
out
at
first
i
thought
you
had
had
a
drop
too
much
but
i
see
that
not
the
case
out
with
it
you
been
waiting
some
time
my
man
informs
me
you
want
to
tell
me
something
tell
it
tommy
esmond
moistened
his
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
and
spoke
i
do
quite
know
what
instinct
prompted
me
to
come
to
you
we
known
each
other
so
very
intimately
after
all
but
i
always
felt
you
were
a
bit
more
of
a
christian
than
the
other
chaps
i
have
known
less
of
a
pharisee
that
you
would
be
more
likely
to
find
excuses
for
a
poor
devil
who
had
yielded
to
temptation
do
get
on
said
spencer
a
little
impatiently
he
did
not
at
all
like
the
turn
the
conversation
was
taking
tommy
spoke
brokenly
he
could
not
put
his
words
together
very
coherently
it
appeared
but
his
halting
utterance
was
simply
due
to
emotion
i
was
at
elsinore
gardens
playing
cards
you
know
elsinore
gardens
flat
he
was
quite
sober
but
his
agitation
made
him
wander
a
bit
or
he
would
not
have
put
the
question
of
course
i
know
flat
it
was
you
who
took
me
there
said
spencer
yes
we
went
there
on
the
night
of
the
raid
but
i
was
not
playing
at
your
table
i
remember
you
lost
and
i
won
well
somebody
has
to
lose
and
somebody
else
has
to
win
spencer
made
no
comment
on
this
obvious
truism
tommy
esmond
again
moistened
his
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
he
was
a
long
time
in
coming
to
the
point
but
he
came
to
it
at
last
well
old
man
i
was
playing
with
an
old
pal
of
mine
with
whom
i
have
been
in
business
for
years
we
had
a
nice
code
of
signals
arranged
i
was
as
cautious
as
i
could
be
but
my
partner
had
been
dining
out
and
he
was
a
bit
indiscreet
there
were
three
or
four
men
watching
us
they
caught
us
both
although
as
i
tell
you
i
was
cautious
but
i
made
one
slip
and
they
were
down
on
me
like
a
knife
you
do
know
my
partner
it
is
the
end
of
him
but
it
is
the
end
of
tommy
esmond
also
to
say
that
spencer
was
disgusted
would
be
to
convey
a
faint
idea
of
his
feelings
and
yet
as
he
looked
at
the
huddled
trembling
form
in
the
chair
his
sentiment
was
rather
one
of
compassion
than
loathing
what
was
there
behind
what
tragedy
of
circumstance
had
driven
this
apparently
lighthearted
butterfly
little
creature
to
such
crooked
ways
you
an
old
hand
then
it
not
the
first
time
you
cheated
tommy
esmond
smiled
wanly
he
did
not
answer
the
question
at
once
what
age
do
you
guess
me
spencer
at
a
casual
glance
a
little
over
fifty
you
may
be
older
looking
at
you
closely
you
do
seem
a
bit
made
up
dye
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
my
dear
sir
i
am
old
enough
to
be
your
father
i
shall
never
see
sixty
again
and
when
did
you
take
to
this
game
esmond
thought
a
little
before
he
replied
he
was
evidently
counting
the
years
when
i
was
i
got
an
into
society
i
was
then
enjoying
an
income
of
two
pounds
a
week
i
was
a
clerk
in
an
insurance
office
at
i
left
the
insurance
business
and
started
cheating
for
a
living
spencer
uttered
a
horrified
ejaculation
he
had
never
come
across
anything
quite
like
this
at
any
rate
in
actual
experience
would
you
like
to
know
something
of
my
history
or
would
you
like
to
kick
me
out
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
asked
esmond
quietly
but
there
were
still
some
remnants
of
compassion
in
spencer
and
he
was
also
a
little
curious
he
was
dealing
after
all
with
a
human
document
tommy
revelations
would
add
to
his
experience
of
life
tell
me
all
you
would
like
to
say
he
said
it
will
be
a
relief
to
unbosom
myself
after
the
years
i
have
led
this
life
was
esmond
answer
when
i
left
elsinore
gardens
with
my
life
in
ruins
i
felt
i
could
have
shrieked
it
all
out
to
the
policeman
standing
at
the
corner
i
came
on
here
because
i
thought
you
would
listen
to
me
because
i
felt
sure
you
were
not
a
pharisee
spencer
motioned
him
to
the
sideboard
mix
yourself
another
stiff
peg
and
steady
your
nerves
then
tell
me
as
much
as
you
like
esmond
went
over
and
helped
himself
after
a
few
seconds
the
trembling
ceased
and
he
was
able
to
speak
in
a
fairly
steady
voice
my
father
was
a
solicitor
in
a
small
way
of
business
in
an
obscure
town
in
the
west
of
england
there
were
three
children
an
elder
brother
myself
and
a
sister
my
elder
brother
succeeded
to
the
practice
and
is
still
in
the
same
place
making
both
ends
meet
on
a
microscopic
income
my
sister
is
dead
my
father
was
a
deeply
religious
man
and
did
more
than
his
duty
by
his
family
he
scraped
and
pinched
to
give
us
a
good
education
that
being
the
only
capital
he
could
leave
us
i
was
placed
in
an
insurance
office
the
head
of
which
was
a
distant
connection
of
my
mother
if
i
had
chosen
to
be
content
with
my
lot
i
daresay
in
time
i
might
have
done
fairly
well
as
i
had
more
than
average
abilities
and
gave
complete
satisfaction
in
the
performance
of
my
duties
unfortunately
i
ran
across
by
the
purest
accident
a
young
man
some
couple
of
years
my
senior
his
father
a
man
of
very
good
family
had
died
a
short
time
previously
and
left
him
a
very
decent
income
of
about
two
thousand
a
year
he
had
been
at
a
private
school
with
me
when
we
were
boys
this
young
man
took
a
violent
fancy
to
me
i
was
slim
and
not
bad
looking
in
those
days
he
had
the
to
some
of
the
best
houses
in
london
through
his
aristocratic
connections
he
took
me
with
him
everywhere
as
his
bosom
friend
i
had
certain
social
instincts
derived
from
heaven
knows
where
and
i
soon
found
my
feet
in
twelve
months
i
was
able
to
run
alone
sometimes
i
was
able
to
get
into
houses
where
even
he
could
not
gain
a
footing
he
laughingly
declared
that
i
had
beaten
him
in
the
social
race
but
he
was
a
fellow
without
a
particle
of
envy
or
meanness
in
his
nature
and
he
was
rather
proud
than
otherwise
that
the
pupil
had
outstripped
the
master
he
paused
for
a
moment
it
was
evident
that
having
kept
silence
for
so
many
years
it
was
an
enormous
relief
to
unbosom
himself
in
spite
of
his
disgust
spencer
could
not
but
feel
interested
in
this
bit
of
he
had
often
felt
curious
as
to
tommy
past
and
now
that
curiosity
was
going
to
be
satisfied
he
understood
now
why
the
little
man
had
never
made
any
but
the
most
distant
allusions
to
his
home
or
his
relatives
the
life
suited
me
down
to
the
ground
but
there
was
always
the
terrible
problem
of
ways
and
means
good
clothes
travelling
expensive
flowers
etc
i
had
got
to
three
pounds
a
week
but
that
go
far
in
the
circles
to
which
i
had
been
transplanted
it
began
to
dawn
upon
me
that
delightful
as
the
life
was
i
was
playing
the
fool
and
neglecting
the
substance
for
the
shadow
people
asked
me
to
their
big
parties
often
to
their
dinners
and
to
but
there
was
no
money
in
it
in
fact
i
was
getting
out
of
my
depth
i
had
already
been
obliged
to
borrow
small
sums
from
to
cover
my
expenses
bitterly
i
made
up
my
mind
that
sooner
or
later
i
must
cut
it
and
take
life
seriously
like
the
poor
man
i
was
i
belonged
to
a
good
club
where
i
had
all
my
letters
addressed
i
lodged
in
a
little
street
in
bloomsbury
in
cheap
apartments
my
friend
alone
knew
this
address
he
would
have
helped
me
to
a
considerable
extent
but
strange
to
say
considering
what
i
did
afterwards
i
shrank
from
accepting
actual
cash
from
him
spencer
interrupted
him
for
a
second
you
would
not
sponge
upon
your
friend
instead
you
took
to
cheating
your
acquaintance
i
take
it
that
is
what
you
are
going
to
tell
me
esmond
nodded
quite
right
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
cut
it
and
disappear
from
a
world
in
which
i
had
no
right
to
intrude
i
had
even
made
up
my
mind
as
to
the
exact
date
at
the
close
of
the
season
when
i
would
disappear
and
return
to
the
humdrum
life
from
which
my
friend
roused
me
a
few
days
before
that
date
something
very
strange
happened
my
life
has
always
been
full
of
surprises
a
few
weeks
before
the
fixed
date
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
nobleman
a
member
of
one
of
the
families
in
england
he
was
then
about
thirty
very
handsome
very
popular
with
both
men
and
women
he
is
dead
now
but
of
course
i
shall
not
mention
his
name
which
would
startle
you
if
you
heard
it
as
i
have
said
his
family
was
a
very
distinguished
one
but
poor
for
its
position
my
friend
whom
for
the
sake
of
convenience
i
will
call
lord
frederick
lived
in
good
style
never
seemed
short
of
cash
and
paid
his
debts
promptly
those
who
knew
were
sure
that
he
got
little
or
no
help
from
his
family
yet
he
betted
at
played
cards
nearly
every
night
and
lived
generally
the
life
of
a
man
with
a
fair
income
his
own
explanation
was
that
he
had
some
intimate
friends
on
the
stock
exchange
who
put
him
on
to
any
good
thing
going
in
the
course
of
the
year
according
to
his
own
account
he
made
a
considerable
sum
out
of
racing
lord
frederick
like
my
first
friend
took
considerable
notice
of
me
after
we
had
become
acquainted
several
times
he
invited
me
to
his
club
afterwards
he
told
me
that
he
had
a
premonition
i
should
be
useful
to
him
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
when
the
deadly
temptation
came
to
me
when
i
learned
what
manner
of
rascal
he
was
it
was
the
close
of
the
season
in
a
very
few
days
more
i
should
have
looked
my
last
on
this
gay
and
alluring
existence
should
have
ceased
to
lead
this
double
life
of
a
poor
clerk
by
day
a
young
man
of
fashion
by
night
spencer
suddenly
interrupted
but
was
there
not
a
great
risk
of
detection
were
you
never
recognised
in
the
city
by
some
chance
west
end
acquaintance
up
to
then
no
of
course
i
must
have
been
found
out
in
time
if
only
from
the
suspicious
circumstance
that
i
could
never
accept
any
day
invitations
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
weighed
most
strongly
with
me
in
the
resolve
to
give
it
up
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
the
tommy
esmond
who
bore
himself
so
bravely
in
his
new
world
who
had
managed
to
outlive
all
curiosity
as
to
his
antecedents
should
be
discovered
in
his
true
colours
a
poor
city
drudge
in
an
insurance
office
to
return
to
my
story
i
had
dined
with
lord
frederick
at
the
no
i
will
not
give
the
name
of
the
club
one
of
the
most
exclusive
in
london
it
might
put
you
on
his
track
he
had
ordered
a
choice
dinner
and
he
plied
me
liberally
with
wine
my
heart
was
very
full
at
the
prospect
of
having
to
say
to
this
luxurious
life
in
a
very
few
days
time
after
dinner
we
went
into
the
which
was
nearly
empty
as
most
of
the
members
had
left
london
there
were
only
two
other
occupants
and
they
were
at
the
far
end
of
the
apartment
practically
we
had
the
place
to
ourselves
he
urged
me
strongly
to
take
a
trip
over
to
paris
as
his
guest
i
should
have
loved
to
go
but
the
wrench
had
to
be
made
some
time
it
might
as
well
be
made
now
besides
i
was
heavily
in
debt
for
a
poor
man
and
i
had
not
the
cash
to
purchase
the
necessary
outfit
for
such
a
trip
he
would
not
accept
my
first
refusal
but
tried
to
persuade
me
into
reconsidering
when
i
still
persisted
he
bluntly
asked
me
my
reasons
as
i
have
said
i
was
very
depressed
that
night
at
the
prospect
of
all
i
was
saying
goodbye
to
this
mood
was
responsible
for
my
blurting
out
a
great
portion
of
the
absolute
truth
i
explained
to
him
that
i
had
already
accepted
too
much
of
his
hospitality
which
my
circumstances
did
not
enable
me
to
return
that
i
could
no
longer
take
advantage
of
his
generosity
after
this
avowal
he
did
not
speak
for
some
little
time
all
the
while
regarding
me
with
an
intense
gaze
that
embarrassed
me
very
much
for
telling
me
the
truth
he
said
at
length
confidence
is
quite
safe
with
me
he
added
after
a
pause
you
are
a
poor
man
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
your
appearance
does
not
suggest
the
fact
well
i
may
tell
you
that
from
the
first
moment
i
made
your
acquaintance
i
was
pretty
certain
you
were
i
told
him
a
little
more
am
so
poor
i
said
frankly
i
can
not
afford
to
keep
up
appearances
any
longer
in
a
few
days
i
shall
leave
a
world
i
ought
never
to
have
entered
anyway
it
is
the
last
time
i
shall
dine
with
you
and
i
do
suppose
we
shall
ever
meet
again
unless
we
run
across
each
other
by
chance
in
a
very
different
sphere
have
absolutely
made
up
your
mind
to
do
this
for
the
reasons
you
have
given
he
asked
presently
i
replied
may
say
it
is
hobson
choice
i
am
heavily
in
debt
if
i
cut
my
wants
down
to
next
to
nothing
it
will
take
me
a
year
to
pay
off
what
i
owe
i
laughed
bitterly
i
turned
thief
i
could
not
possibly
go
on
do
want
to
force
your
confidence
was
lord
frederick
next
remark
having
had
a
taste
of
this
rather
glittering
world
i
presume
you
will
leave
it
with
considerable
regret
dare
not
say
what
i
feel
i
said
with
conviction
seems
to
me
that
in
the
old
life
to
which
i
am
returning
i
shall
suffer
the
tortures
of
lost
souls
then
he
shot
at
me
an
extraordinary
question
wonder
whether
you
would
care
to
become
a
partner
in
my
business
my
heart
suddenly
grew
light
was
there
a
chance
that
i
could
still
keep
on
that
through
his
assistance
i
could
find
a
decently
paid
occupation
after
all
i
only
wanted
a
few
hundreds
a
year
more
a
bachelor
can
live
in
the
best
society
on
comparatively
little
but
he
must
have
that
little
and
the
insurance
office
did
not
furnish
it
i
were
competent
enough
i
faltered
he
smiled
i
thought
there
was
a
little
touch
of
a
sneer
in
that
smile
i
think
you
would
be
competent
enough
but
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
would
like
the
business
sufficiently
ca
say
positively
of
course
till
i
know
the
nature
of
it
but
i
do
think
i
should
be
very
difficult
to
please
nor
do
i
want
any
extravagant
remuneration
just
enough
to
keep
up
a
decent
appearance
share
would
be
half
neither
more
nor
less
he
said
curtly
then
he
relapsed
into
a
long
silence
as
if
he
were
thinking
very
hard
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
low
strained
voice
here
esmond
i
do
know
very
much
of
you
but
i
believe
you
to
be
a
gentleman
the
business
i
am
engaged
in
is
a
very
peculiar
one
and
it
is
more
than
probable
it
will
not
appeal
to
you
if
you
refuse
you
are
to
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
this
conversation
between
us
shall
be
forgotten
i
gave
him
more
than
my
word
i
added
my
solemn
oath
that
i
would
never
divulge
a
syllable
i
had
for
some
little
time
felt
that
there
was
a
mystery
about
him
i
hazarded
to
myself
that
he
was
perhaps
engaged
in
some
spying
work
repugnant
to
any
man
of
fine
susceptibilities
but
quite
remunerative
i
was
startled
and
to
an
extent
horrified
by
what
he
told
me
he
was
a
professional
made
his
living
by
robbing
his
rich
acquaintances
he
had
been
at
the
game
since
he
was
do
pretty
well
as
you
can
guess
by
the
way
in
which
i
live
he
remarked
at
the
conclusion
of
his
strange
confession
with
a
smart
confederate
and
i
am
sure
you
would
prove
one
i
could
quadruple
my
gains
one
is
hampered
by
working
alone
it
a
scoundrel
business
of
course
but
i
can
always
persuade
myself
i
am
not
really
doing
very
much
harm
certainly
not
as
much
as
the
swindling
sort
of
i
win
money
from
rich
fools
rob
them
if
you
like
it
does
at
least
as
much
good
in
my
pockets
as
theirs
i
suppose
there
was
already
some
moral
kink
in
me
waiting
to
blossom
forth
under
proper
encouragement
for
though
i
was
very
much
startled
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
profoundly
shocked
as
i
might
have
been
by
a
less
subtle
form
of
robbery
i
did
not
accept
or
refuse
that
night
i
wanted
to
think
i
knew
it
was
the
turning
of
the
ways
on
the
one
hand
roguery
with
the
accompanying
delights
of
the
fashionable
world
on
the
other
the
deadly
drab
life
of
the
poor
city
drudge
in
the
morning
my
mind
was
made
up
i
went
into
partnership
with
my
new
friend
and
you
made
a
fortune
i
suppose
asked
spencer
in
a
very
cold
voice
esmond
shook
his
head
and
spencer
was
not
at
all
sure
that
the
next
words
were
truthful
ones
no
a
comfortable
living
nothing
more
we
made
a
good
deal
but
we
had
to
lose
a
good
deal
too
in
order
to
avert
suspicion
your
friend
is
dead
you
say
so
you
went
on
with
it
after
his
death
yes
for
a
little
time
alone
then
i
too
got
in
a
partner
the
man
who
was
with
me
there
was
a
long
silence
between
the
two
men
spencer
broke
it
first
and
what
are
your
plans
he
asked
i
shall
sneak
out
of
the
country
morning
and
make
my
way
to
france
i
shall
hide
myself
in
some
little
village
under
an
assumed
name
and
rust
out
the
little
man
rose
and
looked
at
his
former
friend
with
an
embarrassed
air
well
thanks
for
having
listened
to
me
so
patiently
it
has
been
a
tremendous
relief
to
me
to
pour
it
all
out
he
did
not
offer
his
hand
for
he
felt
certain
it
would
not
be
taken
spencer
stopped
him
as
he
was
at
the
door
you
have
money
i
suppose
something
put
by
out
of
your
your
winnings
esmond
voice
was
hesitating
again
it
was
very
doubtful
if
he
was
speaking
the
truth
hardly
a
out
of
them
it
was
lightly
come
lightly
go
all
the
time
but
my
father
left
me
a
little
bit
which
will
keep
me
going
in
a
cheap
place
spencer
did
not
believe
him
the
probability
was
he
had
put
away
safely
a
snug
little
in
view
of
the
detection
which
might
come
at
any
moment
of
such
a
hazardous
occupation
one
word
before
you
go
said
the
young
man
finally
is
there
much
cheating
going
on
at
elsinore
gardens
esmond
turned
and
looked
the
speaker
straight
in
the
face
this
time
he
certainly
seemed
to
be
speaking
the
truth
but
he
might
be
a
most
accomplished
liar
none
at
all
except
when
i
and
my
partner
were
there
if
there
had
been
i
should
have
spotted
it
i
awfully
sorry
for
for
it
having
happened
at
her
house
for
i
daresay
people
will
hint
nasty
things
she
did
suspect
anything
then
not
a
bit
replied
esmond
we
did
play
there
more
than
about
twice
a
week
and
we
never
went
in
for
high
stakes
and
of
course
we
had
to
lose
pretty
often
to
make
things
look
square
and
miss
keane
suspected
nothing
either
as
he
remembered
the
beautiful
face
and
sad
history
spencer
felt
almost
ashamed
of
himself
for
putting
the
question
bless
your
soul
no
a
thousand
times
no
the
little
rogue
seemed
to
speak
with
unusual
warmth
why
she
loathes
cards
she
never
can
be
got
to
join
in
she
has
suffered
too
much
from
gambling
he
went
out
of
the
room
slowly
and
into
the
night
spencer
half
pitied
the
poor
devil
who
had
made
such
a
hash
of
his
life
through
his
desire
to
step
out
of
his
own
class
he
sat
down
and
ruminated
a
long
time
over
the
strange
history
which
had
been
unfolded
to
him
the
next
morning
the
fugitive
tommy
esmond
caught
the
morning
train
from
charing
cross
he
looked
very
sad
and
woebegone
a
pitiable
figure
friendless
and
alone
but
not
quite
friendless
a
young
woman
and
dressed
very
plainly
rose
up
from
one
of
the
seats
as
he
came
on
the
platform
and
touched
him
lightly
on
the
arm
he
recognised
her
and
glanced
round
anxiously
it
was
very
dear
and
sweet
of
you
to
come
stella
but
very
imprudent
you
might
be
seen
by
half
a
dozen
people
i
know
answered
miss
keane
for
the
woman
was
she
i
got
your
letter
this
morning
and
could
not
bear
you
should
go
without
a
last
well
i
can
see
you
are
anxious
i
will
say
it
and
get
back
she
lifted
the
veil
for
a
second
and
held
up
her
face
the
little
man
kissed
her
hastily
and
then
made
for
his
train
it
was
evident
he
had
one
friend
left
in
the
london
he
was
flying
from
as
a
fugitive
and
outlaw
one
woman
who
pitied
him
and
at
the
same
time
that
stella
was
walking
swiftly
from
the
station
guy
spencer
was
making
up
his
mind
that
he
would
pay
a
visit
to
elsinore
gardens
in
the
afternoon
to
see
how
the
land
lay
there
chapter
xiii
five
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
confession
guy
spencer
rang
the
bell
at
flat
in
elsinore
gardens
the
butler
opened
the
door
he
seemed
to
wear
a
sad
and
chastened
demeanour
as
if
overborne
with
the
tragic
events
of
the
previous
night
of
course
all
servants
know
what
is
going
on
in
the
house
of
their
employers
a
scandal
such
as
this
must
have
quickly
penetrated
to
them
is
at
home
the
butler
answered
at
once
he
could
tell
a
lie
with
as
much
grace
as
anybody
but
here
there
was
no
need
to
lie
is
at
home
sir
in
a
manner
of
speaking
but
she
is
very
ill
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
bed
of
course
she
can
not
see
any
visitors
oh
i
quite
understand
said
spencer
hastily
is
miss
keane
in
if
so
i
would
like
to
see
her
for
a
few
moments
the
melancholy
man
in
black
opened
the
door
a
few
inches
miss
keane
is
in
sir
but
i
am
afraid
she
is
not
very
well
either
will
you
kindly
step
in
sir
and
i
will
find
out
if
she
can
see
you
it
was
evident
that
tommy
esmond
and
his
equally
nefarious
partner
had
cast
a
gloom
over
the
whole
establishment
spencer
was
ushered
into
the
pretty
in
a
few
moments
stella
keane
came
in
she
was
evidently
under
the
stress
of
great
emotion
there
were
dark
shadows
round
the
eyes
as
if
she
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
even
her
perfect
mouth
had
a
listless
droop
but
in
spite
of
her
pallor
the
dark
shadows
round
her
eyes
and
that
pathetic
droop
she
was
still
very
beautiful
pathos
became
her
guy
spencer
heart
gave
a
great
leap
as
he
saw
her
there
was
about
her
an
overpowering
an
irresistible
fascination
she
advanced
towards
him
with
outstretched
hands
she
spoke
in
a
broken
voice
the
perfectly
moulded
lips
trembled
it
is
so
sweet
of
you
to
come
of
course
you
have
heard
it
is
all
over
the
town
by
now
oh
this
gambling
the
love
of
which
induces
decent
men
to
cheat
and
become
outcasts
from
their
world
she
spoke
with
the
deepest
emotion
her
bosom
heaving
her
voice
broken
by
the
catchings
of
the
breath
he
was
such
a
good
little
man
he
was
always
so
kind
to
me
she
went
on
and
last
night
those
awful
happenings
branded
a
cheat
he
and
his
friend
and
they
could
not
deny
it
they
had
to
slink
out
i
have
hardly
closed
my
eyes
during
the
night
spencer
my
poor
cousin
is
prostrated
she
added
with
a
shudder
my
girlhood
was
passed
amidst
a
gambling
set
but
i
never
had
an
experience
like
this
she
collected
herself
and
rang
for
tea
you
will
sit
down
she
said
you
can
understand
i
should
have
denied
myself
to
anybody
but
you
i
am
so
terribly
upset
it
is
still
like
a
nightmare
spencer
sat
down
as
he
was
bidden
i
had
a
visit
from
esmond
last
night
he
said
briefly
he
came
straight
on
from
elsinore
gardens
he
told
me
what
had
happened
he
told
me
the
whole
history
of
the
terrible
thing
how
he
has
been
making
his
living
by
cheating
at
cards
since
he
was
a
young
man
miss
keane
raised
her
hands
in
mute
deprecation
how
awful
that
of
course
i
did
not
know
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
apologising
if
one
can
apologise
for
such
a
thing
telling
me
he
was
going
to
live
abroad
under
an
assumed
name
it
was
a
very
short
letter
his
chief
concern
seemed
to
be
that
he
had
incidentally
made
it
unpleasant
for
mrs
how
does
take
it
miss
keane
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
is
a
little
bit
hysterical
you
know
one
moment
she
vows
she
will
shut
up
the
flat
and
go
abroad
for
fear
of
the
nasty
things
that
people
will
say
the
next
moment
she
says
that
confident
in
her
perfect
innocence
she
will
stay
and
face
the
music
and
give
her
parties
as
usual
has
she
asked
your
advice
queried
spencer
she
has
and
my
advice
is
to
go
on
as
usual
it
is
not
her
fault
that
blacklegs
have
crept
into
her
circle
they
creep
into
the
best
houses
the
best
clubs
so
long
as
this
curséd
gambling
goes
on
there
will
be
sharpers
that
true
remarked
spencer
remembering
a
few
episodes
that
had
occurred
in
his
time
and
i
suppose
you
will
still
cast
in
your
lot
with
her
the
look
on
the
beautiful
face
grew
more
pathetic
than
ever
what
can
i
do
spencer
i
have
told
you
my
position
i
wish
my
cousin
were
a
different
woman
altogether
i
wish
she
were
not
so
infatuated
with
this
horrible
gambling
but
i
can
not
influence
her
she
is
too
old
and
set
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
every
moment
the
girl
fascination
took
a
deeper
hold
of
him
she
was
so
very
beautiful
so
very
seductive
but
he
still
kept
himself
in
check
tell
me
what
actually
happened
last
night
how
were
esmond
and
his
partner
found
out
there
was
a
little
interruption
by
the
butler
who
brought
in
tea
miss
keane
busied
herself
amongst
the
cups
before
she
replied
it
is
as
i
told
you
all
a
nightmare
to
me
i
was
wandering
aimlessly
about
as
i
have
told
you
before
i
never
play
i
loathe
cards
too
much
suddenly
there
was
a
scene
at
the
table
where
esmond
and
his
partner
were
playing
three
men
were
standing
watching
the
game
they
had
come
here
often
i
knew
their
names
they
were
friends
of
mrs
queried
spencer
just
a
faint
shade
of
hesitation
crept
into
the
low
voice
oh
yes
friends
of
my
cousin
straight
sort
of
chaps
of
course
i
have
no
doubt
of
that
they
accused
esmond
and
his
partner
major
golightly
of
cheating
of
course
the
charge
was
denied
but
very
these
three
men
were
backed
by
others
who
had
seen
something
suspicious
it
seems
esmond
and
his
partner
had
aroused
suspicion
before
finally
they
confessed
and
slunk
out
of
the
house
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
laid
her
hand
impulsively
on
his
arm
that
first
night
you
came
to
our
house
you
lost
did
you
play
at
the
same
table
with
tommy
esmond
i
forget
the
answer
came
straight
no
i
lost
something
what
was
it
something
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
but
tommy
esmond
did
not
rook
me
that
time
he
was
playing
at
another
table
i
remember
he
was
very
he
was
winning
hand
over
fist
i
say
i
know
i
am
putting
a
very
impertinent
question
but
were
tommy
esmond
and
his
partner
this
major
golightly
the
only
sharpers
who
came
to
this
flat
did
i
lose
my
hundred
and
fifty
or
whatever
it
was
quite
honestly
miss
keane
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
for
a
few
seconds
and
when
she
took
them
away
he
could
see
that
tears
were
slowly
trickling
down
her
cheeks
heaven
knows
spencer
i
do
my
cousin
is
a
strange
woman
she
is
fond
of
gaiety
of
excitement
she
asks
people
about
whom
she
knows
nothing
to
her
flat
i
think
she
added
with
an
hysterical
laugh
she
fancies
she
is
making
herself
a
queen
of
society
if
she
can
get
her
rooms
full
that
is
all
she
wants
when
she
does
that
she
fancies
herself
the
duchess
i
think
i
understand
said
spencer
gravely
and
i
take
it
you
would
give
heaven
and
earth
to
get
out
of
this
environment
if
you
only
knew
how
i
loathe
it
she
cried
in
a
fervent
tone
sometimes
i
think
i
would
rather
run
away
and
be
a
shopgirl
or
a
waitress
to
get
rid
of
this
horrible
atmosphere
guy
spencer
was
very
perturbed
he
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
it
was
his
habit
to
walk
about
even
in
confined
spaces
when
he
was
in
an
emotional
mood
at
length
he
turned
and
faced
her
squarely
look
here
miss
keane
it
rather
nonsense
talking
about
being
a
waitress
or
a
you
told
me
you
had
a
small
income
saved
from
the
wreck
how
much
is
it
i
am
asking
in
no
spirit
of
impertinent
curiosity
i
have
a
reason
for
asking
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
she
replied
something
like
a
hundred
a
year
paid
to
me
quarterly
by
my
cousin
dutton
who
is
my
trustee
then
you
are
not
exactly
a
pauper
shopgirls
and
waitresses
do
earn
that
but
it
would
help
said
miss
keane
in
a
stifled
voice
a
hundred
a
year
does
not
go
far
with
clothes
and
everything
he
longed
to
take
her
in
his
arms
there
and
then
and
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
so
far
was
he
subjugated
by
her
subtle
fascination
but
certain
things
occurred
to
him
he
thought
of
his
old
ancestry
his
uncle
whose
heir
he
would
be
even
a
faint
idea
of
his
cousin
nina
flashed
through
his
mind
what
would
his
relatives
say
to
a
marriage
like
that
the
marriage
with
a
girl
however
beautiful
picked
up
in
a
flat
owned
by
a
woman
of
good
family
but
doubtful
reputation
but
he
could
not
afford
to
lose
her
he
was
rich
he
could
indulge
any
passing
whim
out
of
his
ideas
he
spoke
miss
keane
i
am
very
interested
in
you
will
you
agree
to
look
upon
me
as
a
friend
she
looked
up
at
him
from
under
downcast
eyes
spencer
somehow
i
have
always
looked
upon
you
as
a
friend
as
something
different
from
the
ordinary
man
i
meet
in
a
place
like
this
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
atmosphere
away
from
your
cousin
who
can
not
keep
her
parties
free
from
disgraceful
scandals
i
have
told
you
how
fervently
i
long
to
say
to
it
all
spencer
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
it
was
quixotic
but
then
he
was
a
quixotic
person
and
anyway
he
was
marking
time
he
would
ask
her
to
marry
him
in
the
end
but
at
the
moment
he
did
not
clearly
see
his
way
to
do
so
suppose
a
woman
friend
offered
to
lend
you
five
hundred
pounds
to
enable
you
to
get
clear
of
this
stifling
atmosphere
what
would
you
say
you
could
go
and
live
where
you
like
and
look
around
if
a
woman
friend
asked
me
that
i
think
i
should
say
yes
you
have
agreed
that
i
am
your
friend
true
a
man
friend
said
guy
suppose
i
made
you
the
same
offer
what
is
your
answer
from
a
man
friend
i
fear
my
answer
must
be
an
unhesitating
even
to
you
he
admired
her
answer
he
could
gather
from
it
that
she
respected
herself
too
much
to
snatch
at
any
offer
that
came
along
but
he
would
play
with
her
still
why
he
asked
the
beautiful
eyes
still
a
little
clouded
with
her
tears
met
his
unfalteringly
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
was
her
answer
i
am
poor
spencer
but
i
am
very
proud
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
in
his
i
admire
you
for
that
answer
stella
i
may
call
you
stella
may
i
not
but
i
am
not
quite
the
ordinary
type
of
man
i
am
going
to
speak
quite
plainly
to
you
if
you
accept
that
five
hundred
pounds
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
for
any
return
i
want
you
to
understand
that
she
shot
at
him
a
swift
glance
from
under
the
downcast
eyes
you
are
a
man
out
of
a
thousand
nay
out
of
ten
thousand
she
said
and
in
her
voice
there
was
a
note
of
great
appreciation
if
stella
keane
ever
felt
a
good
impulse
in
her
life
it
was
towards
this
man
who
was
doing
his
best
to
befriend
her
listen
to
me
said
spencer
persuasively
her
delicate
hand
still
lying
in
his
i
do
know
that
i
have
done
much
good
to
other
people
in
my
life
but
i
do
want
to
help
you
i
should
like
to
get
you
out
of
this
beastly
hole
my
proposal
is
that
i
shall
take
for
you
a
little
furnished
flat
and
supplement
your
income
or
give
you
the
five
hundred
pounds
down
to
do
what
you
like
with
it
is
for
you
to
choose
you
would
do
this
for
me
said
stella
softly
you
must
really
like
me
then
men
do
do
this
sort
of
thing
for
women
unless
they
like
them
i
like
you
very
much
stella
and
i
want
to
help
you
he
knew
that
he
could
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
at
his
will
but
he
forebore
he
was
not
going
to
spoil
this
somewhat
idyllic
wooing
it
can
not
take
place
for
a
week
or
so
she
said
presently
i
can
not
quite
leave
my
cousin
in
the
lurch
i
must
give
her
some
sort
of
notice
of
course
i
can
make
the
excuse
that
the
events
of
last
night
have
completely
shattered
my
nerve
i
do
wonder
was
spencer
comment
now
about
this
little
matter
we
have
been
speaking
of
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
i
paid
this
money
into
your
bank
and
left
you
to
make
your
own
arrangements
i
suppose
you
have
a
bank
yes
miss
keane
had
a
a
very
small
one
she
smilingly
remarked
that
it
would
give
the
manager
a
shock
when
such
a
large
sum
was
paid
into
it
i
will
draw
the
money
in
cash
and
bring
it
to
you
said
spencer
then
nobody
will
be
able
to
guess
from
whom
it
comes
he
rose
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
stay
very
much
longer
at
any
moment
his
reserve
might
break
down
he
might
be
impelled
to
change
the
rôle
of
the
benevolent
friend
into
that
of
the
ardent
lover
and
for
a
long
time
after
he
had
left
stella
keane
sat
absorbed
in
the
most
serious
thoughts
there
was
no
doubt
he
was
ardently
in
love
with
her
but
he
was
not
yet
quite
prepared
to
screw
up
his
courage
to
the
sticking
place
it
was
easy
to
understand
the
obligations
he
owed
his
family
were
weighing
on
his
mind
the
woman
he
made
his
wife
would
one
day
be
the
countess
of
southleigh
he
had
to
think
of
all
this
and
all
he
knew
about
her
was
learned
from
her
own
statement
and
she
had
a
cousin
who
was
from
his
point
of
view
certainly
not
a
gentleman
above
all
things
stella
keane
was
a
very
young
woman
and
never
shrank
from
looking
facts
squarely
in
the
face
she
must
play
a
waiting
game
guy
spencer
was
very
deeply
in
love
but
he
was
not
a
hotheaded
impetuous
boy
the
sort
of
amorous
youth
who
runs
off
with
a
chorus
girl
regardless
of
consequences
lovers
of
this
kind
were
very
rarely
met
with
if
guy
spencer
did
marry
her
and
she
could
not
at
the
moment
be
sure
he
would
he
would
be
fully
conscious
of
the
disadvantages
to
himself
entailed
by
such
a
marriage
would
her
fascination
be
strong
enough
to
conquer
his
better
judgment
at
any
rate
for
the
present
he
was
prepared
to
advance
her
five
hundred
pounds
and
ask
nothing
but
her
friendship
in
return
it
was
an
offer
that
she
would
have
been
a
fool
to
refuse
presently
she
rose
and
went
up
to
bedroom
that
sorely
perturbed
lady
had
risen
flung
on
a
and
was
reclining
on
a
sofa
i
ca
sleep
i
only
fidget
and
fidget
about
was
the
explanation
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
get
up
very
wise
said
stella
calmly
you
a
little
bit
too
hysterical
you
know
you
should
keep
your
nerves
in
order
as
i
do
mine
not
always
was
the
sarcastic
rejoinder
they
go
to
pieces
in
thunderstorms
and
air
raids
do
they
the
exception
proves
the
rule
my
dear
lady
well
i
have
come
up
here
to
indulge
in
a
sparring
match
i
have
some
very
great
news
for
you
spencer
called
this
afternoon
he
has
left
me
very
long
the
elder
woman
became
interested
at
once
you
do
mean
to
say
he
has
asked
you
to
marry
him
stella
laughed
no
he
has
although
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
he
does
later
on
it
seems
tommy
esmond
called
on
him
last
night
and
made
a
clean
breast
of
his
whole
history
frowned
then
i
think
he
was
a
great
fool
everybody
of
course
will
know
what
actually
happened
that
he
was
discovered
cheating
but
he
need
not
go
and
tell
him
more
than
he
would
learn
from
general
rumour
stella
face
hardened
a
little
you
must
make
some
allowances
for
him
he
must
have
been
in
a
terrible
state
of
tension
when
he
felt
that
his
career
was
ended
he
was
so
very
proud
you
know
of
the
position
in
society
that
he
had
won
for
himself
he
must
have
felt
like
a
man
on
the
eve
of
execution
he
was
hardly
responsible
for
his
thoughts
or
actions
he
is
very
spoke
more
gently
yes
of
course
i
am
sorry
i
said
that
my
dear
and
after
all
it
does
make
any
difference
how
much
he
told
or
how
little
the
result
to
him
is
the
same
and
now
for
your
great
news
what
are
they
you
say
spencer
has
not
asked
you
to
marry
him
stella
told
her
of
guy
suggestion
and
her
acceptance
of
it
it
is
too
good
a
chance
to
refuse
so
my
dear
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
it
was
some
time
before
the
elder
woman
seemed
quite
able
to
grasp
it
when
she
did
her
astonishment
seemed
unbounded
of
all
the
strange
things
i
have
ever
heard
she
began
but
stella
cut
her
short
with
a
little
mocking
laugh
not
quite
so
strange
when
you
think
it
quietly
out
she
said
if
he
really
knew
anything
about
me
if
i
could
produce
a
few
respectable
relatives
if
i
had
some
of
your
blue
blood
in
my
veins
he
would
have
proposed
this
afternoon
nodded
her
rather
dishevelled
head
i
think
i
see
he
is
very
much
in
love
with
me
went
on
stella
quietly
anyway
so
much
so
that
he
does
want
to
lose
sight
of
me
while
he
is
making
up
his
mind
hence
his
offer
but
he
could
see
you
here
stella
shook
her
head
he
would
loathe
this
house
after
what
occurred
last
night
and
he
thinks
i
am
in
an
unholy
set
he
really
is
an
awful
dear
you
know
so
and
upright
his
great
aim
is
to
get
me
away
from
the
environment
settled
herself
comfortably
amongst
her
sofa
cushions
she
was
an
excitable
and
fussy
person
about
trifles
but
she
took
the
great
things
of
life
with
a
calm
and
equal
mind
well
my
dear
go
as
soon
as
it
suits
yourself
you
have
been
a
good
pal
to
me
and
i
shall
be
sorry
to
lose
you
but
if
you
have
got
a
decent
chance
you
would
be
a
fool
not
to
take
it
miss
keane
was
strongly
of
the
same
opinion
anyway
she
was
glad
the
interview
was
over
that
had
taken
everything
in
such
good
part
she
might
have
turned
nasty
if
the
mood
had
seized
her
later
on
miss
keane
wrote
a
long
letter
to
tommy
esmond
to
an
address
which
he
had
communicated
to
her
in
his
note
of
the
morning
the
same
evening
she
held
a
long
conversation
with
her
cousin
and
trustee
dutton
who
came
to
elsinore
gardens
in
obedience
to
an
urgent
summons
on
the
telephone
chapter
xiv
nina
spencer
sat
in
the
of
the
big
house
in
carlton
house
terrace
awaiting
the
few
guests
who
had
been
invited
to
a
small
informal
her
father
very
infirm
for
his
years
sat
opposite
to
her
in
a
big
the
earl
spoke
in
his
low
quavering
voice
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
woman
herself
judging
from
what
little
we
have
seen
of
her
she
has
very
perfect
manners
just
a
trifle
too
perfect
i
can
quite
understand
that
for
the
average
man
she
possesses
considerable
charm
and
she
has
great
good
looks
many
people
would
call
her
beautiful
but
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
said
on
the
day
i
received
guy
letter
announcing
his
clandestine
marriage
pity
of
it
lady
nina
was
a
quiet
robust
and
practical
young
person
fond
of
looking
facts
in
the
face
and
looking
at
them
very
squarely
she
had
been
as
much
shocked
at
her
cousin
rash
marriage
as
the
earl
himself
but
it
was
an
accomplished
fact
only
two
courses
were
open
the
first
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
guy
and
his
wife
the
second
to
admit
the
wife
to
a
guarded
intimacy
lord
southleigh
had
declared
warmly
in
his
first
disgust
that
he
would
never
look
upon
his
young
kinsman
face
again
but
nina
had
prevailed
with
milder
counsels
guy
was
his
heir
and
in
the
course
of
nature
would
succeed
to
the
family
honours
they
would
not
cut
themselves
adrift
from
him
and
they
must
make
up
their
minds
to
tolerate
this
wife
of
whose
antecedents
he
could
give
no
satisfactory
account
the
one
fact
he
did
mention
that
she
was
a
cousin
of
did
not
weigh
much
with
them
came
of
a
fairly
good
family
so
far
as
birth
counted
but
it
was
both
impecunious
and
addicted
to
making
unfortunate
alliances
one
of
her
sisters
had
run
away
with
a
young
fellow
who
had
been
her
father
valet
she
was
a
woman
who
would
have
a
good
many
undesirable
relatives
knocking
about
miss
stella
keane
the
daughter
of
an
impoverished
irishman
might
well
belong
to
this
band
of
undesirables
more
especially
as
guy
statements
about
her
antecedents
were
of
the
most
bald
and
unsatisfactory
nature
it
was
all
very
sad
and
regrettable
from
every
point
of
view
but
as
nina
calmly
pointed
out
several
young
heirs
to
peerages
had
been
running
amok
lately
in
the
matrimonial
sense
and
taking
their
wives
from
very
questionable
quarters
guy
might
have
married
some
coarse
and
common
creature
from
the
it
was
unfortunate
in
a
way
that
he
had
a
considerable
fortune
of
his
own
and
could
snap
his
fingers
at
the
displeasure
of
his
relatives
if
they
presumed
to
show
it
but
somehow
knowing
guy
as
well
as
she
did
nina
did
not
believe
that
the
future
countess
of
southleigh
who
would
in
due
course
wear
the
family
jewels
was
likely
to
be
coarse
or
common
guy
was
too
fastidious
too
innately
a
gentleman
to
be
snared
by
a
creature
of
that
kind
and
on
her
first
introduction
the
young
wife
made
a
much
more
favourable
impression
than
might
have
been
anticipated
considering
the
prejudices
arrayed
against
her
she
was
not
in
the
least
servile
or
obsequious
in
the
presence
of
these
two
very
aristocratic
persons
but
she
bore
herself
with
a
certain
kind
of
shrinking
modesty
as
if
asking
pardon
for
having
intruded
into
the
family
her
attitude
to
her
husband
appeared
to
be
one
of
shy
adoration
tempered
with
perfect
good
taste
her
deep
affection
for
him
while
not
obtrusive
or
ostentatious
seemed
to
express
itself
in
her
tender
glances
the
soft
cadences
of
her
voice
when
she
addressed
him
nina
made
up
her
mind
to
one
thing
that
if
she
was
not
genuinely
and
devotedly
in
love
with
him
she
must
be
one
of
the
most
perfect
actresses
to
be
met
with
off
the
stage
and
guy
was
still
infatuated
when
he
had
made
her
that
strange
offer
he
knew
that
he
was
drifting
but
he
had
still
left
some
small
remnant
of
but
her
fascination
had
proved
too
strong
every
day
she
wove
the
chains
more
strongly
round
him
and
then
there
came
a
time
when
absence
from
her
was
unbearable
when
he
took
to
counting
the
hours
that
elapsed
between
their
next
meeting
the
end
was
inevitable
the
moment
came
when
he
definitely
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
not
break
away
that
existence
without
her
would
be
intolerable
they
were
married
quietly
before
the
registrar
a
strange
wedding
for
the
heir
to
the
southleigh
earldom
no
relatives
of
his
were
present
as
he
had
foreborne
to
give
them
any
notice
of
his
intention
she
was
unattended
also
even
her
cousin
dutton
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
knowing
her
future
husband
dislike
of
the
young
man
she
had
not
paid
him
the
compliment
of
requesting
his
attendance
the
day
before
the
marriage
she
spoke
to
him
in
a
tremulous
voice
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
guy
darling
i
have
said
very
little
about
this
before
but
you
must
not
think
i
am
blind
to
the
sacrifices
you
are
making
from
i
bid
adieu
to
my
past
life
to
all
the
few
friends
and
acquaintances
i
have
made
i
know
that
you
will
be
happier
by
my
doing
so
henceforth
i
devote
my
whole
life
to
you
your
people
shall
be
my
people
if
they
will
forgive
me
and
have
me
he
clasped
her
to
his
breast
with
a
lover
rapture
how
sweet
and
womanly
she
looked
as
she
uttered
those
words
in
her
low
broken
tones
he
understood
what
she
meant
for
his
sake
she
was
going
to
give
up
all
that
shady
crew
to
see
as
little
of
her
objectionable
cousin
as
possible
she
explained
later
on
that
she
could
not
ignore
him
altogether
as
he
had
the
management
of
her
small
affairs
in
his
hands
but
all
this
could
be
conducted
by
correspondence
guy
was
delighted
he
knew
well
enough
that
his
own
world
would
not
accept
his
marriage
kindly
that
they
would
never
take
his
wife
to
their
offended
bosom
but
they
would
rub
along
somehow
there
were
plenty
of
men
he
could
bring
to
their
house
and
perhaps
a
few
decent
women
who
were
perfectly
respectable
but
not
too
and
anyway
the
world
was
well
lost
for
love
like
this
it
can
not
be
said
that
on
the
social
side
their
existence
was
a
very
brilliant
one
it
did
not
matter
so
much
to
guy
he
had
never
been
of
society
he
liked
his
men
friends
and
having
been
a
bachelor
so
long
he
was
fond
of
club
life
he
got
quite
as
much
amusement
and
distraction
as
he
wanted
his
wife
had
many
lonely
hours
but
she
was
wise
in
this
respect
that
she
never
sought
to
chain
him
to
her
side
whenever
he
came
home
he
found
her
there
waiting
for
him
affectionate
and
welcoming
perhaps
after
her
stormy
and
chequered
past
what
would
have
been
dullness
to
others
seemed
to
her
the
peace
she
had
been
longing
for
she
got
on
very
well
with
her
husband
male
friends
most
of
whom
openly
expressed
amongst
themselves
their
admiration
for
her
if
she
had
been
a
woman
of
a
flirtatious
temperament
she
could
have
had
a
good
time
without
overstepping
the
bounds
of
decorum
but
she
never
exceeded
the
limits
of
strict
friendship
she
never
indulged
in
an
intimacy
that
could
have
the
least
element
of
danger
in
it
the
general
vote
was
that
she
was
very
beautiful
very
charming
in
a
quiet
elusive
way
but
naturally
of
a
cold
and
unimpassionable
nature
only
for
her
husband
did
her
glance
take
on
a
warmer
expression
her
voice
a
tenderer
tone
the
few
women
who
came
to
the
house
found
her
unsatisfactory
the
impression
made
upon
them
and
women
are
pretty
shrewd
when
dissecting
one
of
their
own
sex
was
that
she
was
a
person
who
lived
too
much
within
herself
had
a
rooted
disinclination
to
let
herself
go
in
those
little
confidential
chats
which
are
indulged
in
when
no
men
are
present
and
for
that
studied
reticence
there
must
be
some
cogent
reason
above
all
she
never
referred
to
her
girlhood
never
made
any
allusions
to
her
family
the
general
impression
was
that
spencer
had
something
to
hide
anyway
after
many
months
of
married
life
guy
was
still
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
ever
and
he
was
always
profoundly
touched
by
the
pretty
and
impressive
way
in
which
she
insisted
that
all
the
advantages
were
on
her
side
that
she
could
never
repay
him
sufficiently
for
the
sacrifices
he
had
so
cheerfully
made
of
course
guy
knew
nothing
of
what
his
friends
were
saying
the
men
who
admired
her
beauty
and
were
disappointed
at
the
negative
qualities
which
accompanied
it
the
women
who
found
her
unsatisfactory
and
were
determined
that
she
had
something
to
hide
all
he
knew
and
was
content
in
knowing
was
this
that
after
many
months
of
matrimony
for
they
had
been
married
few
weeks
before
the
armistice
was
proclaimed
that
armistice
which
was
to
be
the
precursor
of
a
golden
era
he
was
quite
happy
she
was
a
perfect
wife
from
his
point
of
view
and
he
never
looked
back
with
the
faintest
misgiving
what
he
had
done
then
he
would
do
again
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
her
reticence
with
regard
to
the
past
was
as
profound
with
him
as
with
the
various
acquaintances
who
occasionally
visited
her
not
even
the
close
intimacy
of
married
life
had
elicited
any
of
those
allusions
and
confidences
which
enable
one
to
piece
together
in
some
measure
the
of
the
person
who
makes
them
but
guy
had
a
generous
nature
and
was
one
of
the
least
suspicious
of
men
he
attributed
this
strange
reticence
to
the
fact
that
the
past
contained
nothing
but
painful
memories
that
even
to
the
man
she
loved
she
could
not
reopen
the
old
wounds
on
this
particular
night
lady
nina
was
awaiting
her
guests
it
was
a
little
dinnerparty
to
meet
the
young
married
couple
six
in
all
herself
and
father
and
spencer
a
young
woman
friend
of
the
hostess
and
an
old
friend
of
the
southleigh
family
hugh
murchison
already
met
with
in
the
early
chapters
of
this
history
murchison
was
the
first
arrival
he
walked
with
a
slight
limp
the
result
of
a
bad
wound
in
the
leg
he
had
been
for
a
very
long
time
at
his
own
home
with
the
effects
of
he
had
only
been
in
london
for
a
few
days
and
it
was
ages
since
the
southleighs
had
seen
him
they
welcomed
him
warmly
after
a
little
desultory
conversation
nina
spoke
you
know
from
my
note
that
you
are
here
especially
to
meet
guy
and
his
wife
the
wife
that
he
sprang
upon
us
in
such
a
sudden
and
dramatic
manner
yes
i
understood
that
you
know
i
have
been
out
of
the
world
so
long
and
more
than
half
the
time
not
in
my
right
senses
that
i
had
heard
nothing
of
the
details
till
a
day
or
two
ago
i
picked
it
up
from
club
gossip
then
i
was
told
that
guy
had
picked
up
a
girl
from
nowhere
about
whom
nothing
was
known
and
married
her
on
the
sly
at
a
i
suppose
it
would
be
too
unkind
to
assume
that
guy
had
gone
off
his
head
lord
southleigh
growled
out
from
his
of
course
he
was
off
his
head
when
he
did
it
and
the
devil
of
it
is
he
seems
just
as
much
off
his
head
now
they
are
like
my
dear
boy
after
several
months
of
marriage
lady
nina
laughed
my
dear
father
gets
more
cynical
every
day
he
insinuates
as
a
general
proposition
anyway
it
can
be
deduced
from
his
remarks
that
every
man
who
marries
a
girl
for
love
ought
to
be
disillusioned
shortly
after
the
honeymoon
well
certainly
guy
is
as
much
in
love
as
ever
and
to
be
quite
fair
she
seems
just
as
much
in
love
with
him
she
putting
it
on
i
suppose
suggested
hugh
who
in
a
less
obtrusive
fashion
was
nearly
as
cynical
as
his
host
if
she
came
from
nowhere
and
nobody
knows
anything
about
her
we
may
safely
assume
that
she
married
him
for
his
money
and
that
he
was
too
infatuated
to
recognise
the
fact
is
she
very
bewitching
she
is
certainly
very
was
nina
reply
many
people
say
she
is
beautiful
from
a
man
point
of
view
she
would
be
considered
very
charming
in
a
subtle
and
elusive
sort
of
way
of
course
my
father
hates
her
it
is
a
terrible
shock
to
his
pride
to
think
she
is
going
to
inherit
the
family
honours
guy
could
have
married
anybody
although
there
would
always
have
been
still
the
danger
that
he
would
have
been
married
for
his
money
when
it
comes
to
this
point
there
is
not
much
difference
between
the
and
adventuress
from
which
remarks
it
will
be
gathered
that
the
lady
nina
spencer
was
a
young
woman
of
independent
opinions
and
not
too
strongly
imbued
with
caste
prejudices
hugh
reflected
for
a
few
moments
his
thoughts
had
travelled
back
to
those
days
at
blankfield
which
now
seemed
so
very
far
oft
what
folly
will
not
a
certain
type
of
man
commit
for
the
sake
of
a
pretty
woman
jack
pomfret
in
a
moment
of
frenzy
had
taken
his
life
when
he
found
he
was
tied
up
to
a
girl
the
accomplice
and
the
decoy
of
a
criminal
and
guy
spencer
a
man
of
a
very
different
type
from
the
pomfret
had
made
a
hash
of
his
opportunities
flouted
his
family
obligations
to
pursue
the
desire
of
the
moment
to
marry
out
of
his
own
class
what
i
hear
is
that
there
is
something
very
mysterious
about
her
that
she
preserves
a
strange
reticence
as
to
her
past
makes
no
allusion
to
family
or
relatives
does
guy
know
what
other
people
do
not
know
and
is
he
keeping
his
mouth
shut
it
is
strange
even
if
a
man
marries
a
it
comes
out
sooner
or
later
that
her
father
was
a
railway
porter
or
something
of
that
sort
he
pulled
himself
up
suddenly
and
added
awkwardly
i
say
you
know
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
very
indiscreet
i
forgot
for
the
moment
that
she
is
one
of
the
family
now
a
deep
growl
came
from
the
earl
armchair
she
is
not
one
of
the
family
she
never
will
be
if
the
young
fool
had
not
been
left
that
money
by
his
godmother
he
would
never
have
dared
to
do
this
disgraceful
thing
by
gad
hugh
it
is
over
a
hundred
years
since
there
was
such
a
in
our
family
please
heaven
it
will
be
a
hundred
years
before
there
is
another
nina
took
up
the
conversation
at
the
point
where
her
angry
father
left
it
of
course
hugh
you
can
say
what
you
like
you
are
our
old
friend
you
are
guy
for
that
matter
and
we
are
prepared
to
discuss
this
thing
with
you
quite
frankly
guy
may
know
more
than
we
imagine
personally
i
think
he
knows
very
little
and
only
what
she
has
told
him
but
surely
she
must
have
given
some
particulars
of
herself
cried
hugh
in
amazement
that
a
man
like
his
friend
spencer
endowed
with
a
fair
share
of
should
take
a
wife
upon
trust
as
it
were
to
be
sure
pomfret
had
done
the
same
thing
but
then
poor
old
jack
possessor
of
many
excellent
qualities
was
singularly
deficient
in
he
was
one
of
those
who
never
looked
before
they
leaped
nina
shrugged
her
shoulders
all
we
know
is
that
she
was
a
miss
stella
keane
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
gambled
away
his
fortune
at
cards
and
on
the
as
for
relatives
she
has
for
cousin
a
a
woman
of
good
birth
but
of
somewhat
shady
reputation
who
no
longer
mixes
with
her
own
class
there
is
another
cousin
a
man
whose
name
i
forget
i
gather
more
from
what
has
been
omitted
than
what
is
actually
said
that
he
is
not
a
very
desirable
person
and
has
not
visited
spencer
since
her
marriage
that
is
all
i
have
learned
during
these
many
months
not
much
certainly
and
i
suppose
the
lady
dries
up
when
you
try
to
approach
her
on
the
subject
oh
yes
her
manner
then
is
very
marked
was
nina
answer
at
the
slightest
question
she
seems
to
become
frozen
to
shut
herself
up
within
her
shell
you
know
hugh
i
was
prepared
to
make
the
best
of
it
all
for
guy
sake
although
of
course
i
quite
sympathise
with
my
resentment
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
her
manners
or
her
appearance
if
not
a
lady
she
is
most
ladylike
and
she
never
offends
but
all
the
same
i
ca
take
to
her
to
me
there
seems
something
about
her
secretive
and
underhand
she
appears
to
adore
guy
but
as
you
have
suggested
that
may
be
very
accomplished
acting
at
this
point
miss
crichton
lady
nina
friend
was
announced
she
was
not
in
the
inner
counsels
of
the
southleigh
family
so
no
further
allusion
was
made
to
guy
wife
a
few
moments
later
the
spencers
arrived
guy
shook
his
old
friend
murchison
warmly
by
the
hand
they
had
met
of
late
years
only
once
or
twice
during
hugh
brief
leave
from
the
front
when
they
had
exchanged
a
few
mutual
inquiries
the
young
husband
turned
to
his
wife
looking
very
slender
and
elegant
in
a
filmy
cream
confection
stella
one
of
my
oldest
friends
hugh
murchison
we
were
boys
together
you
must
have
heard
me
speak
of
him
the
young
woman
held
out
her
hand
with
a
charming
smile
that
lighted
up
the
rather
sad
face
and
made
her
look
what
so
many
of
her
admirers
said
she
was
quite
beautiful
yes
major
murchison
i
have
heard
of
you
from
my
husband
and
how
much
you
have
suffered
in
this
cruel
war
you
must
come
and
see
us
and
renew
your
old
friendship
for
a
moment
hugh
could
not
speak
the
room
seemed
suddenly
peopled
with
ghosts
of
the
past
summoned
by
the
soft
tones
of
that
charming
voice
so
low
and
sweetly
modulated
then
collecting
himself
with
a
great
effort
he
dropped
her
hand
and
made
some
formal
answer
and
at
that
moment
the
butler
announced
that
dinner
was
served
chapter
xv
and
informal
can
be
either
very
lively
or
very
dull
depending
no
doubt
upon
the
careful
selection
of
the
guests
also
on
the
personality
of
the
host
and
hostess
who
can
sometimes
exercise
magnetic
influence
nina
was
as
a
rule
a
very
vivacious
hostess
her
father
was
uncertain
if
he
were
in
a
congenial
atmosphere
amongst
his
old
friends
and
comrades
he
would
radiate
geniality
but
if
there
was
one
guest
who
did
not
quite
hit
it
off
with
him
between
whom
and
himself
there
was
an
undefined
spirit
of
personal
antagonism
he
dried
up
at
once
and
became
gloomy
and
morose
as
his
guest
of
honour
sitting
at
his
right
hand
he
had
the
whose
entrance
into
the
family
he
had
so
bitterly
resented
during
the
long
courses
he
hardly
spoke
a
word
he
was
rude
almost
to
boorishness
but
although
stella
was
fully
conscious
that
she
was
there
on
sufferance
her
admirable
enabled
her
to
comport
herself
with
unruffled
demeanour
if
this
spiteful
old
man
hoped
that
he
was
annoying
her
with
his
churlish
behaviour
she
would
not
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
was
hurt
she
ignored
him
as
he
purposely
ignored
her
miss
crichton
a
cheerful
chatty
young
woman
whose
flow
of
good
spirits
made
her
welcome
at
many
houses
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
host
finding
lord
southleigh
disinclined
to
conversation
and
guessing
the
reason
of
it
she
divided
her
remarks
between
stella
spencer
and
murchison
who
sat
next
her
a
girl
she
felt
just
a
little
bit
sorry
for
stella
lord
southleigh
was
not
playing
the
game
his
attitude
was
altogether
illogical
it
was
open
to
him
to
refuse
to
receive
his
unwelcome
niece
at
all
that
would
have
been
perfectly
comprehensible
but
having
admitted
her
to
his
house
it
was
in
the
worst
possible
taste
to
so
openly
proclaim
his
dislike
and
detestation
lady
nina
talked
brightly
to
her
cousin
guy
in
the
random
flashes
of
her
conversation
taking
in
the
others
with
the
solitary
exception
of
her
father
who
sat
there
glum
and
silent
in
one
of
his
blackest
and
most
unapproachable
moods
and
miss
crichton
did
her
best
really
working
very
hard
to
counteract
the
sombre
influence
of
the
taciturn
host
but
in
spite
of
the
brave
efforts
of
the
two
young
women
there
was
no
exhilaration
in
the
air
only
a
sort
of
depression
such
as
is
felt
in
the
atmosphere
before
the
faint
rumblings
of
a
thunderstorm
nobody
really
felt
comfortable
not
a
single
guest
would
feel
anything
but
relief
when
the
tedious
evening
drew
to
a
close
guy
spencer
was
relieved
in
a
way
that
his
uncle
had
ostensibly
buried
the
hatchet
but
still
he
never
felt
happy
in
that
uncle
house
the
strong
disapproval
was
there
if
suppressed
for
the
sake
of
politeness
these
little
informal
dinners
given
at
long
intervals
to
impress
upon
him
that
he
was
still
a
recognised
member
of
the
family
bored
him
extremely
they
were
always
strictly
limited
as
to
numbers
and
the
other
guests
were
generally
people
of
no
importance
on
the
outer
fringe
of
that
society
in
which
the
southleighs
moved
it
was
difficult
to
know
what
stella
was
feeling
for
she
had
such
admirable
but
if
she
was
a
sensitive
woman
she
must
have
been
cut
to
the
heart
by
the
behaviour
of
her
elderly
relative
and
her
suffering
must
have
been
more
poignant
from
the
fact
that
this
contemptuous
behaviour
must
be
apparent
to
every
other
member
of
the
party
while
the
two
young
women
were
chattering
away
battling
as
it
were
against
the
general
depression
hugh
murchison
was
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
strange
that
his
recollections
had
harked
back
to
that
tragedy
at
blankfield
while
nina
was
speaking
of
the
young
spencer
and
if
his
memory
and
his
eyesight
were
not
playing
him
false
he
was
sitting
opposite
to
the
unhappy
pomfret
widow
six
years
make
a
considerable
difference
in
the
personal
appearance
of
any
man
or
woman
and
they
had
made
a
difference
in
her
if
he
had
met
her
in
the
street
he
would
not
have
known
her
perhaps
he
would
not
have
known
her
but
for
that
sudden
accidental
throwing
back
of
the
memory
of
old
times
in
other
words
if
his
mind
had
not
been
accidentally
diverted
to
jack
pomfret
he
would
have
failed
to
recognise
the
woman
whom
he
once
knew
under
the
name
of
norah
burton
and
yet
could
he
be
sure
let
him
think
a
little
six
years
ago
norah
burton
looked
twenty
and
davidson
the
detective
assured
him
she
was
at
least
four
years
older
than
she
looked
the
appearance
of
youth
he
had
added
was
one
of
her
assets
this
young
woman
did
not
look
a
day
older
than
and
taking
the
computation
of
the
years
she
must
be
at
least
thirty
but
if
she
were
norah
burton
and
had
retained
that
priceless
asset
of
youth
she
would
still
have
that
four
years
advantage
then
norah
burton
hair
was
fair
and
wavy
stella
spencer
was
dark
still
it
is
easy
for
a
woman
to
alter
the
colour
or
the
appearance
of
her
hair
if
stella
keane
had
arisen
like
the
phoenix
from
norah
burton
she
would
alter
herself
in
every
detail
so
far
as
nature
permitted
her
still
it
is
said
that
everybody
in
the
world
has
a
double
often
in
his
own
experience
he
had
claimed
acquaintance
with
somebody
whom
he
had
mistaken
for
an
old
friend
and
smilingly
apologised
for
his
error
norah
good
looks
had
been
of
a
rather
uncommon
kind
but
there
must
be
dozens
of
women
in
the
world
more
or
less
like
her
then
as
miss
crichton
harmless
chatter
flowed
on
he
thought
of
other
things
norah
had
an
obscure
past
on
which
such
guarded
confidences
as
she
permitted
herself
to
indulge
in
threw
little
or
no
light
it
would
appear
that
stella
keane
history
moved
much
on
the
same
lines
there
were
only
vague
intimations
nothing
definite
nothing
satisfactory
there
was
another
point
of
resemblance
norah
had
one
male
relative
who
came
out
into
the
open
for
inspection
in
her
case
a
brother
afterwards
discovered
to
be
a
criminal
stella
keane
had
one
male
relative
also
in
her
case
a
cousin
of
whom
nothing
was
known
except
that
he
was
an
undesirable
person
who
had
not
visited
his
relative
house
since
her
marriage
no
doubt
for
reasons
well
known
to
himself
and
stella
the
undesirable
cousin
was
lying
low
as
george
burton
would
have
lain
low
when
jack
pomfret
had
openly
acknowledged
norah
as
his
wife
and
yet
and
yet
was
there
anything
in
these
suspicions
was
he
not
allowing
himself
to
be
misled
by
a
chance
resemblance
by
random
coincidences
he
stole
a
look
at
guy
spencer
chatting
amiably
with
his
cousin
the
cousin
whom
rumour
had
persistently
designed
as
the
future
countess
of
southleigh
he
seemed
the
happy
contented
young
married
man
there
was
no
hint
of
trouble
or
regret
in
his
assured
placid
demeanour
evidently
he
was
suffering
from
no
no
suspicion
of
the
beautiful
young
woman
he
had
made
his
wife
the
calmness
of
his
aspect
gave
the
lie
to
any
such
disquieting
suggestions
and
the
current
of
murchison
thoughts
ran
swiftly
along
they
had
been
married
some
time
now
if
stella
keane
was
the
impostor
hugh
suspected
her
to
be
from
that
striking
resemblance
to
norah
burton
the
heroine
of
that
tragic
blankville
episode
surely
in
the
close
intimacy
of
wedded
life
something
would
have
escaped
her
that
would
have
aroused
her
husband
suspicions
have
set
him
inquiring
more
closely
into
the
past
granting
that
she
was
a
clever
actress
still
the
most
accomplished
performer
in
the
world
could
not
wear
the
mask
all
day
there
must
come
one
moment
if
not
several
moments
when
that
mask
would
be
inadvertently
dropped
no
he
must
be
mistaken
the
resemblance
must
be
accidental
the
brother
in
the
one
case
the
cousin
in
the
other
were
equally
accidental
coincidences
he
had
got
to
this
frame
of
mind
when
the
men
joined
the
ladies
after
dinner
in
the
spacious
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
have
cleared
the
tension
to
be
relaxed
with
the
change
of
scene
this
was
readily
comprehensible
during
dinner
lord
southleigh
frowning
and
morose
in
close
juxtaposition
with
his
guests
had
in
a
very
real
sense
dominated
the
scene
and
communicated
a
sense
of
his
hostility
and
displeasure
to
all
round
him
not
least
to
the
unhappy
young
woman
who
had
inspired
those
wrathful
feelings
upstairs
he
was
less
in
evidence
he
retreated
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
flung
himself
in
a
deep
armchair
and
in
a
way
removed
himself
from
the
proceedings
there
was
nobody
to
whom
he
felt
himself
constrained
to
be
civil
murchison
he
had
known
from
a
boy
he
could
afford
to
be
uncivil
to
play
the
rôle
of
churlish
host
miss
crichton
was
more
or
less
a
social
grateful
for
invitations
to
good
houses
she
did
not
count
guy
had
forfeited
all
claim
to
consideration
his
wife
ought
to
be
made
to
feel
her
position
every
moment
of
her
life
murchison
gravitated
to
miss
crichton
well
born
she
was
very
poor
and
by
no
means
proud
she
accepted
in
a
meek
spirit
the
social
crumbs
that
were
thrown
at
her
by
her
wealthy
superiors
she
was
always
obliging
and
amiable
she
never
grumbled
at
being
asked
to
join
a
at
the
eleventh
hour
when
some
other
guest
had
failed
she
never
resented
being
put
in
a
small
bedroom
at
a
country
while
a
rich
girl
with
no
ancestry
was
given
a
luxurious
apartment
on
account
of
this
excessive
amiability
this
indifference
to
studied
and
unstudied
slights
she
was
immensely
popular
all
her
friends
declared
her
not
only
to
be
amiable
but
so
sensible
hugh
had
known
her
for
years
and
in
a
way
he
pitied
her
much
more
really
than
she
pitied
herself
for
she
had
long
since
grown
accustomed
to
her
lot
but
what
he
did
know
was
that
she
was
as
shrewd
as
she
was
amiable
that
under
that
gay
and
smiling
exterior
she
concealed
a
very
acute
intelligence
he
wanted
particularly
to
know
her
opinion
of
spencer
if
she
were
frank
enough
to
give
it
for
she
had
especially
developed
the
bump
of
caution
she
heard
a
great
deal
but
what
she
heard
she
generally
kept
to
herself
it
would
have
been
fatal
to
her
somewhat
insecure
position
if
it
could
have
been
said
of
her
with
regard
to
any
particular
scandal
of
course
you
will
never
give
me
away
but
laura
crichton
was
my
informant
he
replied
in
a
general
way
i
was
very
interested
in
my
old
friend
guy
spencer
wife
she
is
a
little
bit
on
the
quiet
side
but
she
is
very
beautiful
and
there
is
certainly
a
wonderful
charm
about
her
of
course
lord
southleigh
behaved
abominably
i
rather
wonder
she
did
not
fling
herself
out
of
the
room
one
can
understand
his
feelings
in
a
certain
way
but
why
does
he
not
take
one
attitude
or
the
other
if
he
elects
to
receive
her
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
an
open
breach
he
ought
to
put
his
hostility
in
his
pocket
miss
crichton
smiled
her
worldly
and
diplomatic
smile
dear
lord
southleigh
is
never
very
successful
at
hiding
his
real
feelings
do
you
see
much
of
her
asked
hugh
presently
oh
very
little
i
have
met
her
a
few
times
here
at
these
little
informal
gatherings
lord
southleigh
wo
have
her
at
their
big
parties
as
i
daresay
you
know
i
have
called
on
her
a
few
times
and
she
has
called
back
that
is
all
well
you
have
seen
enough
to
form
some
opinion
of
her
i
should
dearly
like
to
know
what
that
is
miss
crichton
looked
at
him
quizzically
oh
the
artfulness
of
you
men
do
you
think
i
do
see
that
you
are
trying
to
draw
me
well
i
have
formed
the
same
conclusion
that
you
have
she
is
very
beautiful
and
from
a
man
point
of
view
has
a
subtle
charm
will
that
content
you
hugh
regarded
her
with
a
smile
as
quizzical
as
her
own
no
afraid
it
wo
now
look
here
we
are
very
old
friends
he
said
persuasively
and
i
am
pretty
near
as
discreet
as
you
are
i
never
repeat
what
is
told
me
in
confidence
i
should
like
to
put
a
plain
question
to
you
put
it
i
do
promise
to
answer
it
you
know
of
course
not
but
i
am
very
much
interested
in
this
strange
marriage
of
guy
and
please
do
think
i
am
laying
it
on
with
a
trowel
but
i
have
very
great
faith
in
your
judgment
i
would
trust
it
more
than
i
would
that
of
of
the
women
i
know
of
course
she
knew
he
was
flattering
her
to
obtain
his
purpose
but
then
was
the
most
sensible
woman
absolutely
impervious
to
flattery
ask
me
your
question
she
answered
briefly
hugh
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
we
hear
a
great
deal
about
her
reticence
as
to
the
past
do
you
think
in
a
few
words
that
stella
spencer
is
a
good
and
straight
woman
in
the
general
sense
in
which
we
understand
the
expression
for
a
moment
miss
crichton
hesitated
then
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
he
had
compelled
her
to
a
most
unusual
frankness
you
will
of
course
never
breathe
a
word
of
this
to
anybody
suppose
i
say
i
refuse
to
reply
to
your
question
will
you
take
that
refusal
as
the
answer
you
really
want
i
will
a
thousand
thanks
the
subject
is
closed
between
us
was
hugh
grateful
reply
a
diversion
was
caused
by
the
approach
of
guy
spencer
hugh
old
man
i
am
aching
for
a
long
crack
with
you
come
and
dine
quietly
with
us
next
week
i
suggest
tuesday
if
that
will
suit
you
perfectly
i
am
free
on
tuesday
guy
right
then
but
to
make
sure
if
miss
crichton
will
excuse
us
we
will
go
over
to
stella
and
see
if
i
have
forgotten
something
if
we
are
free
that
night
i
ca
always
carry
these
things
in
my
head
they
crossed
over
to
the
beautiful
young
woman
who
was
sustaining
a
somewhat
listless
conversation
with
her
young
hostess
stella
cried
her
husband
i
have
asked
hugh
to
dine
with
us
on
tuesday
my
recollection
is
that
we
have
nothing
on
for
that
night
but
i
thought
you
had
better
confirm
it
you
carry
these
things
in
your
head
so
much
better
than
i
do
young
spencer
smiled
at
hugh
her
sweet
smile
and
as
she
did
so
her
likeness
to
norah
burton
was
overwhelming
the
norah
burton
who
had
smiled
at
him
in
just
the
same
way
six
years
ago
in
the
at
blankfield
we
are
quite
free
major
murchison
and
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
for
a
few
moments
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
very
shortly
another
coincidence
happened
spencer
made
use
of
a
certain
word
which
is
always
pronounced
in
a
certain
way
by
educated
people
and
in
another
way
by
people
who
are
only
partially
educated
norah
burton
had
pronounced
this
particular
word
in
the
same
way
as
stella
hugh
had
commented
upon
the
fact
to
pomfret
and
that
young
man
had
remarked
to
him
that
he
failed
to
see
it
much
mattered
that
she
was
at
liberty
to
pronounce
the
word
as
she
thought
fit
when
he
got
home
he
passed
a
very
restless
night
when
he
had
gone
up
into
the
drawingroom
after
dinner
he
had
been
half
prepared
to
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
as
a
mere
fantasy
and
then
had
come
his
brief
interview
with
laura
crichton
in
which
she
gave
him
plainly
to
understand
that
in
her
opinion
stella
spencer
was
not
a
good
or
a
straight
woman
and
then
had
come
that
corroborative
little
piece
of
evidence
of
the
mispronunciation
of
a
certain
word
establishing
another
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
that
stella
keane
and
norah
burton
were
one
and
the
same
person
and
if
it
were
so
what
was
his
duty
if
he
could
prove
her
to
be
norah
burton
and
her
undesirable
relative
george
burton
now
freed
from
jail
could
he
permit
such
an
adventuress
to
pass
another
day
in
the
house
of
this
honest
gentleman
whom
she
had
so
skilfully
entrapped
as
six
years
ago
she
had
entrapped
the
guileless
and
trusting
jack
pomfret
the
morning
dawned
and
found
him
still
in
the
throes
of
anxious
thought
chapter
xvi
murchison
thought
over
matters
in
the
cold
clear
light
of
the
morning
when
the
brain
is
at
its
freshest
he
cursed
the
fate
that
ever
seemed
to
mix
him
up
in
the
private
affairs
of
his
friends
first
had
been
that
unhappy
episode
of
poor
jack
pomfret
who
had
not
strength
of
mind
to
survive
the
disgrace
he
had
brought
upon
himself
by
his
impetuous
folly
now
there
was
this
affair
of
guy
spencer
which
he
felt
he
must
go
through
with
and
prove
to
the
bottom
he
must
find
out
definitely
whether
the
likeness
to
norah
burton
was
accidental
or
whether
that
scheming
adventuress
had
for
the
second
time
ensnared
a
trusting
and
unsuspicious
man
on
tuesday
night
when
he
dined
in
eaton
place
with
the
spencers
he
would
seize
an
opportunity
of
putting
to
her
a
few
leading
questions
they
would
be
of
such
a
nature
that
if
his
suspicions
were
correct
they
would
shake
her
certainly
she
had
betrayed
no
embarrassment
at
the
sight
of
him
and
that
was
a
point
in
her
favour
for
assuming
that
she
was
norah
burton
the
name
of
murchison
would
be
quite
familiar
to
her
even
if
she
had
forgotten
his
appearance
after
the
lapse
of
those
six
years
in
the
meantime
he
would
get
as
much
information
about
stella
keane
as
he
could
before
the
date
of
the
dinner
there
was
a
man
at
his
club
gregory
fairfax
a
gossip
who
was
to
be
found
in
the
every
day
at
a
certain
hour
fairfax
was
a
man
of
leisure
and
means
who
had
the
reputation
of
knowing
more
people
and
all
about
them
than
anybody
in
town
he
mixed
in
a
dozen
different
sets
smart
fast
and
bohemian
he
was
equally
at
home
in
belgravia
mayfair
south
kensington
and
several
other
quarters
he
belonged
to
most
of
the
best
clubs
and
many
more
that
had
no
pretensions
to
social
distinction
his
knowledge
of
the
various
phases
of
london
life
was
wide
and
extensive
he
had
also
a
marvellous
memory
he
never
forgot
a
face
or
the
minutest
details
of
a
scandal
to
this
gentleman
with
whom
he
was
on
quite
intimate
terms
having
known
him
from
his
first
introduction
to
the
london
world
hugh
repaired
in
the
hope
of
getting
to
know
all
there
was
to
know
about
this
mysterious
young
woman
who
had
so
suddenly
and
clandestinely
projected
herself
into
the
southleigh
family
after
a
few
casual
remarks
he
opened
the
ball
it
was
an
easy
task
for
there
was
nothing
pleased
fairfax
more
than
to
place
his
extensive
social
knowledge
at
the
service
of
any
friend
or
acquaintance
who
was
in
search
of
details
i
say
fairfax
i
think
you
can
help
me
in
a
little
matter
because
you
have
the
reputation
of
knowing
everything
about
everybody
fairfax
smiled
genially
he
was
very
proud
of
his
profound
social
knowledge
and
nothing
pleased
him
more
than
to
have
his
reputation
alluded
to
in
flattering
terms
fire
away
my
young
friend
i
think
i
have
picked
up
a
bit
in
my
years
of
london
life
who
is
it
you
want
to
ask
me
about
i
dined
last
night
with
my
old
friends
the
southleighs
and
there
for
the
first
time
i
met
mrs
guy
spencer
i
had
heard
of
the
marriage
of
course
but
no
particulars
of
the
young
lady
until
i
came
to
town
a
little
while
ago
all
i
have
learned
is
that
she
was
a
miss
stella
keane
and
that
she
gives
no
very
detailed
account
of
her
family
history
i
gather
the
general
impression
is
that
there
is
a
mystery
about
her
which
she
refuses
to
allow
anybody
to
penetrate
do
you
know
anything
about
her
yourself
fairfax
assumed
an
air
of
great
gravity
and
importance
he
was
now
in
his
element
about
to
pour
out
his
stores
of
knowledge
to
an
interested
and
grateful
listener
there
may
be
one
or
two
people
who
know
as
much
as
i
know
always
remembering
that
there
is
no
knowledge
but
the
chances
are
a
hundred
to
one
you
would
not
come
across
them
it
happens
that
i
was
a
good
deal
in
that
rather
queer
set
which
frequented
flat
she
was
supposed
a
woman
was
she
not
oh
certainly
so
far
as
family
went
but
judging
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
there
is
no
doubt
she
was
a
the
place
from
the
start
was
simply
a
gambling
saloon
sometimes
the
play
was
very
moderate
i
am
fond
of
a
bit
of
a
flutter
myself
but
i
must
own
that
i
never
lost
very
much
and
for
a
long
time
i
never
had
any
suspicions
of
foul
play
ah
but
you
had
later
on
interrupted
hugh
i
come
to
that
before
we
get
on
to
miss
stella
keane
then
one
night
something
happened
do
you
remember
a
little
chap
named
esmond
who
used
to
go
about
everywhere
yes
hugh
remembered
tommy
esmond
although
his
acquaintance
with
him
had
been
of
the
slightest
he
was
a
funny
little
man
very
genial
and
popular
with
everybody
like
myself
he
did
stick
to
any
one
particular
set
but
went
into
a
dozen
different
ones
one
night
he
would
be
dining
at
a
swagger
club
with
a
peer
the
next
he
would
be
hobnobbing
at
a
sort
of
a
place
with
a
actor
very
eclectic
was
tommy
and
nobody
ever
knew
where
the
deuce
he
came
from
he
had
been
so
long
about
that
people
forgot
to
inquire
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
institution
and
took
him
for
granted
as
it
were
well
one
night
one
dreadful
night
tommy
was
discovered
cheating
by
a
couple
of
chaps
who
were
too
sharp
for
him
they
were
common
sort
of
fellows
might
have
been
crooks
themselves
for
all
i
know
and
kicked
up
a
deuce
of
a
row
they
went
so
far
as
to
insinuate
that
was
not
altogether
innocent
and
had
a
hand
in
the
plunder
result
tommy
had
to
make
a
bolt
of
it
what
was
your
own
opinion
about
it
was
it
an
accident
i
might
not
have
believed
it
but
a
similar
thing
took
place
about
a
couple
of
months
later
another
man
was
found
cheating
and
this
time
refused
to
face
the
music
she
closed
down
and
disappeared
from
london
i
have
never
met
anybody
who
has
seen
or
heard
anything
of
her
since
i
expect
she
to
be
found
on
the
continent
like
her
friend
tommy
and
miss
keane
was
an
inmate
of
this
suspicious
household
yes
ever
since
i
went
to
the
house
up
to
a
few
days
after
tommy
bolted
she
left
suddenly
and
was
very
reticent
as
to
where
she
had
gone
to
the
next
i
heard
was
that
she
had
been
married
quietly
to
guy
spencer
did
any
suspicions
attach
to
her
no
it
would
not
be
fair
to
say
that
they
did
she
never
played
herself
but
she
had
a
great
knack
of
hovering
about
the
tables
and
after
the
esmond
episode
one
or
two
men
whispered
that
she
had
been
hovering
about
them
too
much
and
that
thought
she
had
better
get
rid
of
her
might
be
so
or
not
did
you
ever
come
across
a
cousin
of
hers
there
a
man
named
dutton
oh
yes
a
dozen
or
more
times
for
i
went
to
the
flat
pretty
frequently
a
common
fellow
not
in
the
least
like
her
for
in
addition
to
being
remarkably
her
manners
and
appearance
were
those
of
a
lady
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
him
yes
he
an
outside
stockbroker
with
a
small
office
in
the
city
i
ran
against
him
only
last
week
i
do
know
whether
he
recognised
me
or
not
but
i
looked
the
other
way
with
one
or
two
exceptions
the
was
not
one
that
you
cared
to
recognise
when
outside
the
flat
fairfax
had
finished
his
narrative
hugh
thanked
him
warmly
still
he
had
not
learned
anything
really
of
importance
there
was
no
evidence
that
miss
keane
had
cheated
or
helped
others
to
cheat
the
hovering
round
the
was
not
a
particularly
suspicious
action
if
taken
by
itself
she
might
be
signalling
to
her
confederates
of
course
but
there
was
no
evidence
on
which
to
convict
her
a
sudden
thought
struck
murchison
which
prompted
him
to
put
a
question
to
fairfax
she
might
have
been
a
decoy
to
lure
rich
men
to
this
gambling
place
in
order
that
they
might
be
rooked
by
her
accomplices
the
man
shook
his
head
i
do
think
so
she
had
no
scope
for
that
sort
of
game
hardly
knew
anybody
in
her
own
world
for
reasons
which
i
daresay
could
be
very
satisfactorily
explained
i
should
guess
a
not
too
clean
or
reputable
past
she
could
not
get
the
girl
into
houses
where
she
would
pick
up
rich
men
but
you
say
some
men
came
there
who
played
heavily
a
few
answered
fairfax
but
i
always
had
a
notion
that
dutton
picked
those
up
in
the
course
of
his
shady
business
a
mug
here
a
mug
there
who
had
a
few
thousands
to
throw
away
either
on
the
stock
exchange
or
in
gambling
if
the
flat
was
run
on
the
crook
and
it
is
even
betting
it
was
i
should
say
the
proprietors
or
the
syndicate
call
it
what
you
like
were
contented
with
quite
small
profits
i
daresay
a
couple
of
thousand
a
year
would
keep
in
luxury
and
i
suppose
she
must
have
had
a
bit
of
money
of
her
own
and
assuming
that
they
were
all
in
league
tommy
esmond
and
others
would
want
their
bit
suggested
hugh
certainly
assented
fairfax
but
always
granting
that
the
show
was
run
on
the
crook
it
would
be
difficult
to
romp
in
thirty
or
forty
pounds
a
night
with
even
the
small
players
and
the
occasional
mugs
who
were
quite
a
decent
amount
to
divide
at
the
end
of
the
week
well
i
am
awfully
obliged
for
all
you
have
told
me
fairfax
but
it
does
help
you
much
eh
queried
the
elder
man
who
detected
a
certain
note
of
disappointment
in
his
companion
tone
well
candidly
it
does
but
of
course
that
is
no
fault
of
yours
we
may
dismiss
the
business
there
is
no
evidence
there
she
might
have
signalled
to
her
confederates
or
not
it
might
have
been
a
perfectly
innocent
action
she
did
play
herself
she
just
hovered
round
the
tables
to
kill
the
time
of
course
either
theory
will
fit
remarked
the
shrewd
man
of
the
world
who
had
picked
up
so
much
knowledge
of
life
in
his
strenuous
years
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
before
he
spoke
again
now
look
here
murchison
i
can
read
you
like
a
book
i
told
you
very
much
more
than
you
know
yourself
or
could
have
pieced
together
you
are
disappointed
because
i
could
tell
you
anything
of
her
history
prior
to
her
appearance
in
the
household
well
there
i
am
at
fault
and
you
have
a
particular
reason
for
wanting
to
know
in
other
words
you
have
some
suspicions
of
your
own
hugh
felt
he
must
be
cautious
in
connecting
spencer
with
norah
burton
he
might
be
on
the
wrong
track
altogether
have
been
deceived
by
a
striking
but
purely
accidental
resemblance
he
could
not
be
too
frank
with
a
man
of
fairfax
temperament
rumour
had
it
that
he
would
always
respect
a
confidence
but
his
general
reputation
was
that
of
a
chatterbox
he
spoke
guardedly
yes
certain
undefined
ones
quite
undefined
please
understand
that
then
speaking
a
little
more
frankly
what
i
dearly
want
to
know
is
was
she
a
straight
woman
before
she
charmed
my
friend
guy
spencer
into
marrying
her
fairfax
smiled
his
slow
wise
smile
i
am
glad
you
have
put
your
cards
on
the
table
of
course
i
guessed
from
the
beginning
that
it
was
what
you
were
after
well
i
sha
breathe
a
word
of
this
to
anybody
i
can
hold
my
tongue
when
i
have
a
mind
you
have
a
deep
interest
in
the
matter
for
the
sake
of
the
southleigh
family
eh
hugh
had
to
admit
that
it
was
so
well
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
that
up
to
the
present
i
have
not
told
to
anybody
else
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
guy
spencer
marriage
if
he
chose
to
marry
a
girl
without
a
past
that
was
his
affair
but
i
see
you
are
keen
yes
i
am
very
keen
good
well
i
will
give
you
a
little
information
from
which
you
can
draw
your
own
inferences
they
are
as
open
to
you
as
to
me
and
i
shall
just
state
the
bare
facts
as
you
know
esmond
had
to
bolt
to
the
continent
on
a
certain
morning
i
came
up
from
the
country
by
an
early
train
landing
at
charing
cross
i
went
to
the
bookstall
to
buy
a
few
papers
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
one
of
those
persons
who
have
eyes
at
the
back
of
their
head
and
see
everything
going
on
around
them
yes
hugh
knew
that
fairfax
had
a
wonderful
gift
of
observation
in
addition
to
his
many
other
gifts
as
i
turned
away
i
saw
esmond
slink
into
the
station
glancing
furtively
from
right
to
left
as
fearful
of
being
seen
of
course
i
had
not
heard
the
news
and
i
was
not
present
at
the
but
i
guessed
something
was
up
from
his
furtive
appearance
as
he
slunk
along
a
young
woman
walked
swiftly
forward
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
they
were
only
together
for
a
few
seconds
esmond
was
evidently
urging
her
to
leave
him
for
fear
of
recognition
when
they
parted
she
kissed
him
affectionately
in
spite
of
the
heavy
veiling
i
recognised
her
stella
keane
of
course
cried
hugh
stella
keane
fortunately
neither
of
them
saw
me
i
expect
they
were
both
too
agitated
well
there
is
the
fact
as
i
said
just
now
you
can
draw
your
own
inferences
and
perhaps
answer
the
question
whether
she
was
a
good
woman
before
she
married
your
friend
it
is
answered
said
hugh
sternly
a
good
woman
would
not
trouble
to
go
to
the
station
to
say
to
a
derelict
and
kiss
him
affectionately
unless
there
had
been
some
close
and
dishonourable
relationship
between
them
chapter
xvii
arrived
at
eaton
place
about
twenty
minutes
before
the
dinner
hour
his
expectation
was
that
he
would
find
spencer
alone
in
the
and
in
this
hope
he
was
not
disappointed
stella
beautifully
gowned
was
seated
in
a
luxurious
reading
as
he
was
announced
she
rose
and
threw
her
novel
down
she
advanced
to
him
with
outstretched
hand
and
that
smile
oh
how
sweet
of
you
to
come
in
good
time
not
rush
in
just
a
moment
before
dinner
is
served
we
can
have
a
comfortable
chat
before
guy
comes
he
takes
an
awful
time
to
dress
you
know
his
ties
bother
him
really
he
discards
about
half
a
dozen
before
he
gets
the
proper
bow
is
it
silly
she
was
very
girlish
quite
different
from
what
she
had
been
at
the
southleigh
party
staid
demure
a
little
resentful
and
averse
from
conversation
murchison
thoughts
flew
back
to
that
day
at
blankfield
when
he
had
met
a
certain
girl
by
chance
at
the
norah
burton
had
been
just
as
girlish
then
as
spencer
was
now
allowing
for
the
six
interval
she
crossed
over
to
a
chesterfield
and
motioned
him
to
a
seat
beside
her
hugh
obeyed
her
invitation
but
he
felt
sure
that
she
had
done
this
with
a
motive
she
was
about
to
exercise
her
subtle
fascination
on
her
husband
friend
now
please
tell
me
all
about
yourself
she
said
you
are
friend
and
i
have
a
right
to
know
his
friends
are
mine
i
know
what
you
have
done
in
the
war
you
have
suffered
very
terribly
but
before
that
please
enlighten
me
it
was
a
challenge
did
she
desire
to
know
as
much
of
his
past
as
he
desired
to
know
of
hers
he
looked
at
her
very
steadily
you
know
spencer
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
go
back
to
anything
before
those
awful
years
of
war
but
i
remember
as
in
a
sort
of
dream
that
quite
as
a
young
man
i
was
gazetted
to
the
lancers
a
crack
regiment
was
it
not
queried
spencer
my
dear
father
was
in
the
she
was
keeping
it
up
bravely
he
thought
he
remembered
story
the
woman
who
had
said
to
a
fugitive
at
charing
cross
station
and
kissed
him
affectionately
was
hardly
likely
to
be
the
daughter
of
an
officer
in
the
lancers
he
was
not
sure
of
very
much
but
of
this
one
incident
he
was
absolutely
positive
fairfax
was
a
man
who
was
always
certain
of
his
facts
i
ca
remember
much
about
the
early
years
i
expect
i
went
through
the
usual
trials
and
troubles
of
a
young
subaltern
was
subjected
to
a
good
deal
of
ragging
well
somehow
promotion
came
i
was
captain
at
quite
a
youthful
age
the
one
thing
that
sticks
in
my
mind
in
those
days
is
the
fact
that
we
were
quartered
at
blankfield
spencer
lifted
calm
inquiring
eyes
at
blankfield
and
where
is
that
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
heard
of
blankfield
spencer
shook
her
dark
head
no
i
dare
say
it
shows
great
ignorance
but
i
was
never
good
at
geography
i
was
brought
up
so
quietly
i
have
never
travelled
i
know
next
to
nothing
of
my
own
country
and
nothing
of
any
other
she
uttered
these
remarks
with
a
disarming
and
appealing
smile
as
if
asking
pardon
from
a
man
of
the
world
for
having
led
such
an
uneventful
and
sequestered
life
she
as
he
thought
sardonically
the
mysterious
cousin
of
the
affectionate
friend
of
the
tommie
esmond
blankfield
is
rather
a
town
in
yorkshire
it
is
also
a
garrison
town
as
i
said
it
was
my
lot
to
be
quartered
there
was
it
a
nice
place
queried
spencer
with
an
air
of
polite
interest
in
a
way
yes
we
had
a
good
time
but
my
recollections
of
it
are
distinctly
unpleasant
for
i
had
the
misfortune
to
assist
at
a
tragedy
nay
more
to
play
a
part
in
it
which
has
left
an
ineffaceable
record
upon
my
memory
stella
spencer
leaned
forward
there
was
no
momentary
change
of
expression
upon
the
charming
face
her
eyes
met
his
own
with
a
calm
steady
gaze
but
he
thought
and
after
all
that
might
be
fancy
he
detected
a
restless
movement
of
her
hands
i
shall
like
to
hear
about
that
tragedy
if
it
is
not
too
painful
for
you
to
recall
it
she
said
softly
if
she
were
really
what
he
believed
her
to
be
she
was
playing
the
rôle
of
sympathetic
listener
to
perfection
i
had
a
young
chum
of
the
name
of
pomfret
a
mere
boy
impulsive
generous
unsuspicious
little
versed
in
the
ways
of
the
world
absolutely
unversed
in
the
ways
of
women
i
had
promised
his
family
to
look
after
him
looking
back
at
this
distance
of
years
i
realise
how
badly
i
fulfilled
my
trust
how
in
a
sense
i
was
unwittingly
the
cause
of
the
tragedy
that
befell
him
i
wonder
if
you
ever
came
across
my
friend
jack
pomfret
never
but
of
course
i
have
met
so
few
people
and
you
know
the
truth
as
well
as
everybody
else
i
was
not
brought
up
in
my
world
in
your
world
and
that
of
the
southleighs
i
could
never
claim
to
be
more
than
respectable
i
take
it
your
friend
was
a
member
of
some
old
family
the
voice
was
steady
but
he
thought
he
noticed
an
increased
restlessness
in
the
movements
of
the
hands
and
the
admission
that
she
was
a
member
of
the
respectable
struck
him
as
conveying
a
false
note
intentionally
if
what
she
alleged
was
true
that
her
father
had
been
an
officer
in
the
lancers
she
was
a
grade
higher
than
the
respectable
clever
as
she
was
she
had
made
a
false
step
there
you
want
to
hear
the
history
of
that
tragedy
of
the
terrible
circumstances
which
cut
short
the
life
of
my
poor
young
friend
well
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
a
woman
was
the
cause
women
i
suppose
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
most
of
the
tragedies
that
have
happened
to
men
ever
since
the
days
of
eve
i
know
that
is
the
general
opinion
but
i
have
always
been
very
doubtful
as
to
whether
it
is
a
true
one
she
spoke
lightly
but
it
seemed
to
him
her
tone
was
not
quite
so
assured
as
it
had
been
a
moment
ago
anyway
she
was
evidently
intensely
interested
in
the
forthcoming
narrative
at
blankfield
i
happened
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
very
charming
young
woman
who
was
not
received
in
the
society
of
the
place
for
the
reason
that
nothing
was
known
about
her
the
acquaintance
was
made
in
the
most
unconventional
fashion
she
asked
me
to
call
upon
her
and
her
brother
i
told
all
this
to
pomfret
who
knew
the
girl
by
sight
and
he
asked
me
to
take
him
along
with
me
he
had
met
her
very
often
in
the
high
street
and
was
immensely
attracted
by
her
appearance
and
were
you
attracted
too
by
this
formidable
young
lady
major
murchison
interrupted
stella
in
a
way
but
honestly
more
curious
than
attracted
well
to
cut
my
story
as
short
as
i
can
pomfret
soon
arrived
at
an
understanding
with
the
young
woman
to
a
great
extent
without
my
knowledge
they
were
married
secretly
there
were
family
reasons
why
he
could
not
marry
her
openly
but
this
but
this
was
she
speaking
a
little
nervously
or
was
it
only
his
fancy
was
quite
romantic
and
charming
no
doubt
they
were
deeply
in
love
with
each
other
surely
there
was
no
tragedy
to
follow
such
a
delightful
wooing
but
there
was
this
charming
girl
was
an
adventuress
of
the
first
water
she
was
the
accomplice
of
her
criminal
brother
if
brother
he
was
a
day
or
two
after
the
wedding
pomfret
and
i
went
to
dine
with
this
wretched
pair
before
we
sat
down
to
dinner
two
detectives
entered
the
room
and
arrested
the
brother
on
a
charge
of
forgery
spencer
shuddered
how
horrible
how
appalling
and
what
happened
to
the
girl
was
she
arrested
too
no
she
fainted
and
i
dragged
my
friend
away
at
the
time
i
did
not
know
he
had
married
her
when
i
got
him
back
to
the
barracks
he
told
me
his
miserable
story
that
same
night
or
some
time
in
the
next
morning
he
shot
himself
it
was
perhaps
a
cowardly
way
in
which
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
his
folly
but
then
he
was
always
rash
and
impulsive
spencer
spoke
and
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
your
poor
friend
no
wonder
that
memory
haunts
you
and
yet
he
was
not
very
wise
this
poor
adventuress
might
have
been
easy
to
deal
with
she
might
not
have
troubled
him
any
further
if
he
had
made
her
some
small
allowance
would
so
to
speak
have
slunk
out
of
his
life
and
she
might
have
been
innocent
herself
unable
to
break
away
from
this
wretched
criminal
of
a
brother
you
are
very
charitable
spencer
said
hugh
coldly
but
i
fear
i
can
not
agree
with
you
if
the
girl
had
been
naturally
and
innately
honest
she
would
rather
have
swept
a
crossing
than
have
lived
upon
the
gains
of
that
creature
brother
or
lover
or
whatever
he
was
stella
spoke
with
dignity
you
are
i
see
very
much
moved
major
murchison
and
you
can
judge
better
than
i
can
not
pretend
to
understand
the
mentality
of
adventuresses
and
their
criminal
associates
she
added
with
a
light
laugh
but
i
should
say
that
sweeping
a
crossing
is
a
most
uncongenial
occupation
especially
in
the
cold
weather
in
other
words
if
you
had
been
in
her
place
you
would
have
preferred
to
live
on
the
earnings
of
a
rogue
queried
hugh
perhaps
a
little
too
warmly
as
soon
as
he
spoke
he
regretted
his
words
he
had
given
her
an
advantage
of
which
she
was
not
slow
to
avail
herself
she
drew
herself
up
proudly
major
murchison
are
you
not
saying
a
little
too
much
in
presuming
to
place
me
on
the
level
of
the
adventuress
you
have
spoken
of
i
think
it
will
be
more
consistent
with
my
to
leave
your
question
unanswered
and
then
suddenly
her
proud
mood
vanished
and
a
softer
one
took
its
place
her
voice
trembled
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
suspicious
moisture
in
her
eyes
i
see
that
i
was
very
wrong
when
i
suffered
guy
to
persuade
me
to
marry
him
i
have
alienated
him
from
his
friends
and
family
and
alas
i
have
none
of
my
own
to
bring
him
in
exchange
his
uncle
loathes
me
lady
nina
is
polite
and
tolerates
me
and
you
you
his
old
friend
who
have
known
him
from
boyhood
you
dislike
me
also
but
and
here
her
voice
swelled
into
a
proud
note
my
husband
loves
and
trusts
me
while
he
does
that
major
murchison
i
can
snap
my
fingers
at
the
rest
of
the
world
murchison
bowed
respectfully
he
felt
he
had
got
to
recover
a
good
deal
of
lost
ground
so
far
the
woman
had
the
advantage
but
he
did
not
fail
to
notice
the
vulgarity
of
the
last
phrase
snap
my
fingers
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
offended
you
spencer
by
my
indiscreet
remarks
if
you
are
secure
in
guy
love
as
i
am
sure
you
are
you
have
a
very
happy
possession
she
sank
back
on
the
sofa
and
in
a
second
recovered
the
composure
which
had
been
momentarily
disturbed
forgive
me
if
i
have
spoken
a
little
warmly
she
said
but
i
could
not
overlook
what
you
said
just
now
and
then
hugh
shot
at
her
his
last
bolt
i
have
not
yet
told
you
the
name
of
the
girl
who
drove
my
poor
young
friend
pomfret
to
his
death
tell
it
me
if
you
please
but
i
shall
be
no
more
likely
to
know
it
than
the
name
of
your
friend
pomfret
as
i
told
you
i
am
a
member
of
the
respectable
i
can
not
boast
that
i
am
acquainted
with
the
aristocracy
except
through
my
husband
and
yet
your
father
you
told
me
just
now
was
an
officer
in
the
lancers
those
officers
were
all
recruited
from
the
aristocracy
or
at
worst
the
upper
oh
you
are
trying
to
me
and
trap
me
she
cried
bitterly
but
hugh
was
inexorable
the
name
of
that
woman
was
norah
burton
her
accomplice
her
brother
as
she
called
him
was
george
burton
he
had
other
aliases
he
thundered
he
had
shot
his
last
bolt
but
stella
was
not
shaken
she
rose
up
quivering
a
little
he
noticed
that
but
it
might
be
due
to
the
agitation
of
wronged
innocence
the
name
conveys
nothing
to
me
your
attitude
during
these
few
minutes
has
been
very
strange
you
have
insinuated
that
i
am
an
adventuress
on
the
same
level
with
your
miss
norah
something
well
so
far
poor
dear
guy
has
not
shot
himself
and
i
will
take
good
care
he
does
you
have
much
to
gain
by
his
living
if
you
love
him
the
title
and
everything
i
have
no
doubt
he
has
made
his
will
you
would
gain
a
good
deal
by
his
death
i
can
not
say
at
the
moment
which
alternative
would
suit
you
better
you
are
intolerable
you
are
insulting
if
i
tell
my
husband
this
when
he
comes
down
he
will
kick
you
out
of
the
house
but
i
do
think
you
will
tell
your
husband
retorted
hugh
coolly
and
why
not
my
word
will
outweigh
yours
i
have
only
to
tell
him
that
you
brand
me
as
an
adventuress
of
the
same
class
as
this
miss
nora
burton
and
you
will
see
what
he
will
say
but
you
will
not
tell
him
repeated
hugh
spencer
i
did
not
think
we
should
go
so
far
as
we
have
done
but
i
will
put
my
cards
on
the
table
at
once
and
i
do
so
from
certain
indications
in
your
demeanour
i
will
not
say
all
i
have
in
my
mind
i
am
going
to
collect
further
evidence
first
but
i
will
say
this
you
are
not
what
you
seem
he
had
touched
her
now
her
calm
had
gone
her
breast
was
heaving
her
hands
were
moving
more
restlessly
put
your
cards
on
the
table
and
have
done
i
was
stella
keane
when
i
married
my
husband
i
defy
you
to
disprove
that
at
present
no
you
are
the
same
stella
keane
who
saw
tommie
esmond
a
discovered
off
at
the
charing
cross
station
and
kissed
him
an
affectionate
farewell
if
you
were
on
such
intimate
terms
with
that
man
you
are
no
fit
wife
for
my
friend
guy
spencer
he
had
touched
her
at
last
how
did
you
find
that
out
she
gasped
and
her
face
for
a
second
went
livid
she
was
surprised
beyond
the
point
of
denial
and
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
guy
spencer
entered
she
recovered
herself
immediately
went
up
to
her
husband
and
laid
a
caressing
hand
on
his
shoulder
a
perfect
tie
dearest
it
was
worth
the
time
your
friend
major
murchison
has
been
distressing
me
with
a
terrible
story
of
some
tragedy
that
happened
when
he
was
quartered
at
blankfield
guy
spencer
smiled
cheerfully
dear
old
hugh
is
good
at
stories
he
must
tell
it
me
after
dinner
as
she
looked
up
into
her
husband
face
hugh
noticed
the
tender
light
in
her
eyes
lady
nina
had
said
that
if
she
was
not
devotedly
in
love
with
guy
she
must
be
the
most
consummate
actress
off
the
stage
loving
wife
or
consummate
actress
which
was
she
chapter
xviii
hugh
reflected
over
that
interview
in
the
before
dinner
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
not
played
his
cards
very
well
that
he
had
been
a
little
too
precipitate
whether
she
was
norah
burton
or
not
she
was
a
very
clever
young
woman
and
he
had
just
put
her
on
her
guard
by
that
rather
indiscreet
allusion
to
tommy
esmond
if
he
had
no
further
evidence
to
go
on
than
that
incident
she
would
give
her
husband
a
plausible
explanation
of
it
and
hugh
believed
his
old
friend
guy
was
still
deeply
in
love
enough
with
his
wife
to
believe
anything
she
told
him
he
could
imagine
her
telling
that
convincing
story
to
guy
probably
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
her
pretty
eyes
looking
up
to
his
with
the
in
them
esmond
had
been
a
kind
friend
to
her
had
done
her
many
a
good
turn
much
as
she
deplored
his
baseness
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
his
slinking
out
of
the
country
a
branded
fugitive
without
a
forgiving
hand
stretched
out
to
him
backwards
and
forwards
he
revolved
the
matter
in
his
mind
till
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
problem
was
one
he
could
not
solve
himself
and
then
he
suddenly
thought
of
his
old
acquaintance
davidson
of
scotland
yard
the
tall
man
of
military
aspect
who
had
arrested
george
burton
on
that
memorable
night
at
rosemount
he
went
round
to
scotland
yard
presented
his
card
and
inquired
for
davidson
his
old
acquaintance
was
dead
a
man
named
bryant
had
taken
his
place
would
major
murchison
care
to
see
him
in
a
few
seconds
hugh
was
ushered
into
bryant
room
to
his
surprise
and
relief
bryant
was
the
man
who
had
accompanied
davidson
to
blankfield
it
was
pretty
certain
he
would
recall
to
the
minutest
detail
the
circumstances
of
that
visit
bryant
you
know
my
name
by
my
card
of
course
but
i
am
not
so
sure
you
remember
anything
of
the
time
and
place
where
we
last
met
but
the
detective
was
able
to
reassure
him
on
this
point
in
our
profession
sir
we
remember
everything
and
everybody
and
we
never
forget
a
face
it
is
some
years
ago
it
is
true
but
i
recall
the
incidents
of
our
meeting
as
if
they
had
happened
yesterday
poor
davidson
and
i
came
down
to
collar
that
slim
rascal
george
burton
who
by
the
way
got
off
with
a
light
sentence
davidson
saw
you
in
the
afternoon
and
gave
you
the
option
of
staying
away
you
talked
it
over
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
for
certain
reasons
you
would
rather
be
in
at
the
finish
those
reasons
were
connected
with
your
young
friend
pomfret
who
was
infatuated
with
the
young
woman
you
remember
everything
as
well
as
i
do
bryant
i
must
congratulate
you
on
your
marvellous
memory
for
i
suppose
this
is
only
one
out
of
hundreds
of
cases
bryant
smiled
well
pleased
at
this
tribute
to
his
capacity
we
cultivate
our
small
gifts
sir
in
this
direction
well
we
took
the
slim
george
the
girl
fainted
you
dragged
pomfret
out
of
the
house
and
he
shot
himself
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
it
came
out
that
he
had
married
the
young
woman
a
day
or
two
before
and
could
not
face
the
exposure
hugh
paid
a
second
tribute
to
the
detective
marvellous
memory
and
now
bryant
have
you
any
knowledge
of
what
has
become
of
them
people
like
that
are
never
quite
submerged
some
day
or
another
like
the
scum
they
are
they
will
be
found
floating
on
the
top
again
bryant
shook
his
head
no
sir
i
can
not
say
i
have
they
have
not
come
under
our
observation
again
probably
they
are
abroad
under
assumed
names
engaged
in
rascally
business
of
course
but
doing
it
very
much
mind
you
at
present
i
have
very
little
to
go
on
said
hugh
i
may
have
been
deceived
by
a
chance
resemblance
but
i
have
a
strong
intuition
i
am
on
their
track
bryant
attitude
became
alert
at
once
you
say
you
have
no
evidence
well
tell
me
your
suspicions
and
i
will
tell
you
what
weight
i
attach
to
them
first
of
all
before
i
do
that
let
me
know
if
you
would
recognise
norah
burton
and
george
burton
again
in
spite
of
the
passage
of
years
norah
had
fair
hair
the
one
i
am
on
the
track
of
has
dark
hair
the
man
i
have
not
seen
this
time
he
is
a
cousin
not
a
brother
ah
bryant
drew
a
deep
breath
if
they
are
the
people
you
think
sir
and
i
once
saw
them
no
disguises
would
take
me
in
now
tell
me
all
you
know
thus
exhorted
murchison
launched
into
a
copious
narrative
he
explained
that
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
with
the
southleighs
at
carlton
house
terrace
he
had
met
for
the
first
time
the
wife
of
his
old
friend
guy
spencer
that
he
had
detected
in
her
an
extraordinary
likeness
to
norah
burton
the
marriage
had
been
hastily
contracted
next
to
nothing
was
known
about
the
young
woman
antecedents
apart
from
the
very
vague
details
with
which
she
furnished
them
in
the
background
was
a
cousin
by
all
accounts
a
very
common
fellow
who
had
never
visited
the
house
since
the
marriage
then
there
was
the
episode
of
tommy
esmond
being
found
cheating
at
cards
at
the
flat
and
stella
keane
farewell
meeting
with
him
at
charing
cross
station
bryant
made
copious
notes
when
the
narrative
was
finished
he
made
his
comments
there
are
of
course
coincidences
that
may
mean
nothing
or
a
great
deal
major
murchison
however
assuming
that
the
lady
in
question
is
not
our
old
friend
norah
burton
she
is
evidently
not
a
very
estimable
member
of
society
she
was
in
a
shady
set
at
and
tommy
esmond
must
have
been
a
pretty
close
pal
well
i
want
you
to
take
this
case
on
for
me
and
find
out
what
you
can
but
bryant
shook
his
head
sorry
sir
but
in
my
position
i
ca
take
on
private
business
it
is
not
a
public
matter
you
see
unless
you
can
accuse
them
of
anything
hugh
face
fell
i
forgot
that
what
am
i
to
do
can
you
recommend
me
to
a
private
detective
half
a
dozen
sir
all
keen
fellows
but
you
ca
stir
very
much
without
me
in
the
first
instance
you
want
me
to
identify
them
well
i
will
go
so
far
as
that
in
memory
of
the
time
when
we
were
together
in
the
original
job
spencer
you
say
lives
in
eaton
place
i
will
keep
a
watch
on
that
house
till
i
see
her
coming
out
or
going
in
if
i
agree
that
she
was
norah
burton
we
have
got
the
first
step
now
what
do
you
know
about
this
cousin
dutton
only
that
he
is
an
outside
stockbroker
with
an
office
or
offices
in
the
city
good
bryant
opened
a
telephone
book
and
rapidly
turned
over
the
pages
here
he
is
right
enough
george
dutton
george
mark
you
and
bartholomew
court
well
sir
to
oblige
you
i
will
run
down
to
the
city
and
get
a
peep
at
george
dutton
if
my
recollection
agrees
with
yours
i
will
put
you
on
to
one
of
my
friends
and
you
can
have
the
precious
pair
watched
if
they
are
the
persons
you
think
they
are
you
may
depend
upon
it
they
wo
keep
long
apart
they
will
make
opportunities
of
meeting
each
other
anyway
they
must
be
pretty
thick
together
or
he
would
not
put
up
with
being
excluded
from
the
house
hugh
left
with
a
great
sense
of
relief
he
felt
that
the
matter
was
in
very
capable
hands
if
bryant
told
him
that
he
was
following
a
then
the
whole
matter
could
drop
the
fact
of
spencer
relations
with
tommy
esmond
were
hardly
important
enough
to
justify
him
in
disturbing
his
friend
domestic
felicity
at
the
end
of
three
days
the
detective
rang
him
up
the
message
was
brief
come
and
see
me
bryant
received
him
in
his
room
well
major
murchison
your
suspicions
are
quite
correct
i
have
been
very
close
to
the
interesting
pair
spencer
has
camouflaged
herself
very
well
but
beyond
doubt
she
is
norah
burton
our
george
burton
has
been
less
particular
he
has
not
disguised
himself
at
all
the
few
years
have
made
little
or
no
impression
on
him
he
has
hid
himself
in
the
city
trusting
that
nobody
he
ever
knew
would
come
across
him
then
i
was
right
after
all
bryant
and
now
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
this
woman
is
the
worst
type
of
adventuress
all
through
at
least
a
confederate
in
paris
with
burton
in
london
with
tommy
esmond
to
be
fair
we
can
not
say
how
much
or
how
little
she
knew
of
his
forgery
business
your
idea
is
to
turn
her
out
of
her
husband
house
with
or
without
scandal
queried
the
detective
without
scandal
if
possible
i
would
prefer
that
i
suppose
you
would
back
me
up
by
saying
that
you
have
recognised
her
and
this
scoundrel
who
was
yesterday
her
brother
and
is
her
cousin
if
you
push
me
to
it
i
will
major
murchison
for
the
sake
of
our
old
acquaintance
but
for
reasons
which
i
stated
last
time
we
met
i
want
to
mix
myself
up
in
a
purely
private
affair
the
woman
caught
hold
of
a
fool
in
your
friend
pomfret
she
has
caught
hold
of
another
equally
silly
fool
in
your
friend
spencer
please
forgive
my
blunt
language
but
it
is
so
is
it
not
you
are
quite
right
bryant
groaned
poor
hugh
i
seem
fated
to
be
mixed
up
in
these
matters
at
the
present
moment
i
have
a
little
stunt
on
in
which
i
do
require
any
help
a
younger
brother
of
mine
has
got
mixed
up
with
a
young
harpy
in
the
chorus
of
a
theatre
the
young
fool
has
written
compromising
letters
to
her
i
am
trying
to
buy
these
letters
i
need
hardly
tell
you
she
is
asking
a
high
price
i
ca
see
her
at
my
own
place
for
fear
of
my
brother
popping
in
i
have
taken
rooms
in
a
suburb
where
i
see
her
to
carry
on
the
bargaining
bryant
raised
his
hands
well
sir
when
a
woman
once
begins
to
twist
a
man
round
her
little
finger
there
is
no
knowing
to
what
length
he
will
go
profoundly
true
bryant
well
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
for
the
moment
nothing
get
a
little
more
evidence
when
i
watched
this
couple
i
took
my
old
friend
parkinson
with
me
he
knows
them
now
get
him
to
watch
them
he
will
tell
you
where
they
meet
and
how
often
here
is
his
card
he
will
wait
on
you
at
your
convenience
i
quite
see
said
hugh
as
he
took
the
proffered
card
if
i
can
prove
that
they
are
meeting
on
the
sly
it
will
strengthen
my
hands
eh
that
is
the
idea
of
course
at
the
moment
i
do
know
which
you
are
going
to
tackle
first
the
husband
or
the
wife
i
ca
say
myself
my
mind
is
in
such
a
whirl
but
i
feel
i
must
avenge
poor
jack
pomfret
death
bryant
rose
you
will
excuse
me
major
murchison
but
i
have
a
very
busy
day
make
use
of
parkinson
he
is
as
keen
as
mustard
and
if
it
comes
to
this
that
you
want
me
for
purposes
of
identification
i
am
at
your
disposal
in
eaton
place
or
elsewhere
murchison
left
but
not
before
he
had
pressed
a
substantial
cheque
into
bryant
somewhat
reluctant
hand
the
next
day
he
interviewed
parkinson
a
lean
man
of
the
true
breed
he
took
his
instructions
give
me
a
fortnight
if
you
please
sir
a
week
is
hardly
long
enough
i
warrant
from
what
our
friend
bryant
has
hinted
to
me
i
will
have
something
to
report
and
he
had
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
he
appeared
he
produced
a
small
i
glad
you
did
stipulate
for
only
a
week
sir
it
was
rather
a
blank
one
only
one
meeting
i
expect
the
lady
could
get
away
comfortably
but
the
week
after
i
was
rewarded
three
meetings
in
that
second
week
ah
where
do
they
meet
at
quite
humble
little
restaurants
and
queer
places
in
the
city
i
fancy
the
business
is
not
very
flourishing
just
now
for
on
the
last
two
occasions
when
i
followed
them
in
and
sat
at
a
table
where
i
could
observe
them
i
saw
spencer
slip
an
envelope
into
his
hand
good
heavens
cried
murchison
in
a
tone
of
disgust
she
is
keeping
this
criminal
with
her
husband
money
parkinson
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
common
enough
case
sir
if
you
had
seen
as
much
of
life
as
i
have
hugh
shuddered
the
woman
was
depraved
to
the
core
she
could
leave
her
house
in
eaton
place
where
she
had
been
installed
by
her
devoted
and
trustful
husband
and
journey
down
to
some
obscure
in
the
city
to
meet
this
criminal
who
lived
upon
her
bounty
well
the
chain
of
evidence
was
complete
bryant
would
swear
to
the
identification
and
parkinson
would
swear
that
mrs
guy
spencer
once
norah
burton
had
met
george
burton
clandestinely
four
times
in
a
fortnight
and
had
supplied
him
with
money
chapter
xix
was
in
his
blackest
and
most
grim
mood
that
hugh
murchison
walked
to
eaton
place
for
the
purpose
of
paying
an
afternoon
call
upon
spencer
he
had
not
been
near
her
since
the
night
of
the
dinner
had
only
left
cards
and
very
fortunately
he
had
not
come
across
guy
in
the
interval
on
that
particular
night
he
had
reproached
himself
with
indiscretion
he
had
availed
himself
of
fairfax
information
to
tax
her
with
meeting
tommie
esmond
at
charing
cross
station
on
the
morning
of
his
flight
to
the
continent
and
at
the
moment
that
he
had
made
that
dramatic
announcement
the
door
had
opened
to
admit
the
unsuspecting
husband
hugh
had
left
shortly
after
dinner
on
the
plea
of
another
engagement
had
spencer
tried
to
take
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
by
volunteering
some
plausible
explanation
about
her
meeting
with
esmond
she
was
a
clever
young
woman
she
might
try
to
forestall
him
on
the
other
hand
she
might
sit
tight
till
he
forced
her
hand
anyway
he
was
going
to
force
it
armed
with
the
new
evidence
that
had
been
furnished
to
him
spencer
was
not
looking
well
her
eyes
had
lost
their
brightness
her
once
charming
smile
was
forced
and
mechanical
she
rose
as
he
was
announced
and
advanced
to
him
with
outstretched
hands
with
an
exaggerated
air
of
cordiality
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
us
she
seated
herself
on
the
chesterfield
and
motioned
him
to
sit
beside
her
major
murchison
i
fear
i
was
a
little
rude
to
you
the
other
night
you
remember
just
before
guy
came
in
she
clasped
her
hands
nervously
together
i
do
trust
we
are
going
to
be
friends
hugh
looked
at
her
grimly
he
had
no
compassion
for
this
shameless
adventuress
who
had
driven
the
poor
foolish
pomfret
to
his
grave
who
had
ensnared
guy
spencer
a
man
of
stronger
fibre
but
equally
powerless
in
the
hands
of
an
unscrupulous
woman
spencer
to
call
you
by
one
of
the
many
names
by
which
you
are
known
we
were
not
friends
the
last
time
i
was
at
this
house
we
are
bitter
enemies
what
do
you
mean
she
faltered
you
are
speaking
in
riddles
why
should
you
the
old
friend
of
my
husband
be
the
bitter
enemy
of
his
innocent
wife
his
innocent
wife
repeated
hugh
sternly
dare
you
look
me
in
the
face
and
say
that
my
name
even
if
you
fail
to
recognise
me
after
these
years
does
not
recall
to
you
certain
tragic
episodes
at
blankfield
i
know
nothing
of
blankfield
the
voice
was
low
but
very
unsteady
you
put
that
question
to
me
the
other
night
in
a
roundabout
sort
of
way
my
answer
is
the
same
i
know
nothing
of
blankfield
there
was
a
long
pause
hugh
continued
to
look
at
her
with
his
steady
and
disconcerting
gaze
suddenly
she
rose
and
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
long
major
murchison
put
your
cards
on
the
table
you
have
come
into
this
house
an
old
friend
of
my
husband
i
have
done
my
best
to
make
you
welcome
but
you
have
some
spite
against
me
of
what
do
you
accuse
me
i
will
put
my
cards
on
the
table
answered
hugh
in
his
inflexible
voice
on
the
night
i
met
you
at
carlton
house
terrace
i
had
my
suspicions
no
two
women
could
be
so
exactly
alike
since
that
night
i
have
been
picking
up
information
here
and
there
i
have
now
got
a
complete
chain
of
evidence
evidence
of
what
she
gasped
still
pursuing
her
restless
walk
up
and
down
the
room
of
my
having
met
tommie
esmond
at
charing
cross
station
would
you
like
to
hear
the
true
history
of
that
i
shall
be
pleased
to
hear
any
explanation
you
like
to
offer
with
the
reservation
that
i
must
please
myself
as
to
whether
i
accept
it
or
not
you
are
very
hard
major
murchison
as
you
are
not
prepared
to
believe
me
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
i
did
not
embark
on
this
history
but
tommie
esmond
is
really
my
uncle
my
mother
brother
when
i
was
in
low
water
he
was
very
kind
to
me
i
could
not
turn
my
back
on
him
in
his
distress
she
spoke
with
sudden
passion
of
course
you
with
your
pharisaical
way
of
looking
at
things
would
say
i
should
have
forgotten
all
his
previous
kindness
the
tommie
esmond
affair
is
comparatively
a
trivial
one
spencer
i
am
coming
in
a
moment
to
graver
issues
you
still
say
that
the
name
of
murchison
conveys
nothing
to
you
oh
think
well
before
you
answer
remember
i
have
told
you
i
have
overwhelming
evidence
and
believe
me
the
task
i
have
set
out
upon
is
far
from
a
welcome
one
i
still
say
that
the
name
of
murchison
conveys
nothing
to
me
she
spoke
with
a
certain
air
of
assurance
but
he
could
see
that
she
was
quivering
all
over
carry
your
memory
back
to
that
night
at
blankfield
when
your
brother
george
burton
was
arrested
on
a
charge
of
forgery
you
had
been
his
decoy
and
accomplice
in
a
gambling
saloon
in
paris
you
had
inveigled
my
poor
friend
jack
pomfret
into
a
clandestine
marriage
a
few
days
before
jack
unable
to
survive
his
folly
and
disgrace
blew
his
brains
out
if
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
you
were
morally
a
murderess
you
are
mad
raving
mad
she
cried
but
her
voice
seemed
strangled
as
she
made
the
bold
denial
not
mad
spencer
but
very
sane
as
i
will
show
you
in
a
few
seconds
as
i
told
you
i
recognised
you
that
night
at
the
in
spite
of
the
pains
you
had
taken
to
camouflage
yourself
but
i
waited
for
corroborative
evidence
the
detective
who
arrested
your
brother
george
burton
has
seen
you
and
is
prepared
to
swear
to
your
identity
as
norah
burton
then
suddenly
she
gave
way
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
and
stretched
out
appealing
hands
oh
you
are
very
clever
i
see
you
have
found
it
all
out
but
you
will
be
merciful
you
will
not
drive
an
unhappy
woman
to
despair
just
when
she
has
got
into
safe
harbour
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
listen
to
my
miserable
history
i
will
listen
to
anything
you
have
got
to
say
my
childhood
and
girlhood
were
most
wretched
and
unhappy
at
a
time
when
most
girls
are
tasting
the
sweets
and
joys
of
life
i
had
to
live
by
my
wits
i
fell
under
the
influence
of
a
but
very
wicked
man
in
other
words
george
burton
queried
hugh
in
other
words
george
burton
she
repeated
in
the
low
strangled
voice
that
did
not
move
hugh
very
much
i
was
starving
when
he
met
me
and
took
me
up
he
was
genuinely
sorry
for
me
mind
you
i
knew
nothing
of
his
nefarious
schemes
he
hid
those
very
carefully
away
from
me
but
you
were
his
decoy
if
not
his
confederate
in
the
gambling
saloon
in
paris
his
decoy
perhaps
unconsciously
but
never
his
confederate
and
when
did
tommie
esmond
appear
on
the
scene
queried
hugh
oh
much
later
george
got
into
low
water
and
had
not
enough
for
himself
i
then
hunted
up
my
uncle
who
received
me
with
open
arms
hugh
was
developing
the
instincts
of
a
crossexaminer
and
tommie
esmond
i
suppose
introduced
you
to
the
crew
at
the
elsinore
flat
and
you
were
launched
as
the
cousin
of
who
presided
over
this
delectable
establishment
i
was
a
distant
cousin
of
on
my
dear
mother
side
was
the
answer
she
was
lying
terribly
he
felt
assured
but
he
had
a
card
or
two
up
his
sleeve
yet
still
it
was
wise
to
see
how
far
she
would
go
and
when
did
you
part
with
the
brother
george
burton
oh
very
shortly
after
he
came
out
of
prison
i
had
one
interview
with
him
i
could
not
do
less
after
his
kindness
to
me
and
in
the
meantime
i
had
hunted
up
poor
old
tommie
esmond
and
what
did
you
do
after
that
night
at
blankfield
i
think
you
cleared
out
the
next
day
i
heard
you
had
paid
everything
up
thank
heaven
yes
there
was
just
a
little
money
left
my
life
after
that
was
a
nightmare
amongst
other
humiliations
i
was
a
waitress
in
a
a
smile
of
vanity
broke
over
the
charming
face
the
wages
were
very
small
but
i
got
a
lot
of
tips
perhaps
in
this
particular
instance
she
was
not
lying
if
it
was
true
that
she
had
been
in
a
at
all
there
was
a
little
pause
and
then
murchison
spoke
in
his
stern
inflexible
voice
and
how
long
is
it
since
you
saw
george
burton
she
had
answered
the
question
before
but
he
was
hoping
to
entrap
her
into
some
unguarded
admission
he
could
see
that
she
was
considerably
thrown
oft
her
balance
clever
and
ready
as
she
was
by
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
i
told
you
just
now
soon
after
he
came
out
of
prison
and
then
hugh
rose
in
his
wrath
and
then
she
seeing
in
his
face
that
he
had
another
and
a
stronger
card
to
play
got
up
from
her
kneeling
position
and
watched
him
with
an
agonised
countenance
i
am
sorry
to
use
such
harsh
words
to
a
woman
even
such
a
woman
as
you
are
spencer
but
when
you
say
that
you
are
lying
miserably
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
her
face
went
livid
she
assumed
a
tone
of
indignation
but
her
voice
died
away
in
a
sob
how
dare
you
say
that
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
to
make
a
statement
unless
i
can
prove
it
up
to
the
hilt
your
cousin
george
dutton
keeps
a
in
the
city
from
certain
evidence
in
my
possession
i
should
say
it
was
not
a
very
paying
business
stella
did
not
attempt
to
reply
to
this
last
shot
but
she
recognised
that
he
had
gone
about
the
business
very
thoroughly
george
dutton
the
keeper
is
george
burton
the
forger
come
to
life
again
still
i
take
it
on
the
same
criminal
tack
perhaps
in
a
lesser
degree
do
you
admit
he
cried
vehemently
that
george
burton
and
george
dutton
are
one
and
the
same
yes
since
you
seem
to
have
proof
i
admit
it
was
the
somewhat
sullen
answer
that
is
as
well
it
clears
the
ground
up
to
a
certain
point
you
say
you
parted
from
burton
soon
after
his
release
from
prison
and
have
not
seen
him
since
when
was
that
how
long
ago
you
met
him
frequently
as
george
dutton
at
elsinore
gardens
the
courage
of
despair
seemed
to
come
to
her
and
she
ceased
to
tremble
i
will
answer
no
more
questions
tell
me
what
you
allege
and
i
will
admit
or
deny
of
course
you
have
employed
a
detective
you
have
had
me
watched
of
course
i
should
not
presume
to
cope
with
a
clever
woman
like
yourself
you
have
met
george
dutton
alias
george
burton
four
times
within
the
last
fortnight
at
obscure
restaurants
in
the
city
and
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
you
were
handing
to
him
envelopes
containing
money
she
seemed
now
to
recognise
that
the
game
was
up
her
returned
to
her
she
sat
down
and
motioned
to
him
to
seat
himself
you
are
much
too
clever
for
me
major
murchison
you
have
handled
the
matter
very
well
so
well
that
you
have
turned
your
vague
suspicions
into
absolute
certainty
well
what
action
are
you
going
to
take
as
a
matter
of
course
you
intend
to
turn
me
out
of
my
husband
house
if
not
at
the
moment
very
speedily
you
will
admit
i
think
with
your
clever
brain
that
you
should
not
remain
under
the
roof
of
such
an
honourable
english
gentleman
as
he
is
a
day
longer
than
necessary
i
will
admit
it
from
your
point
of
view
if
you
like
oh
believe
me
i
can
see
your
side
replied
this
remarkable
young
woman
but
you
will
forgive
me
major
murchison
if
i
say
that
from
my
point
of
view
i
would
have
preferred
that
you
had
never
been
born
guy
is
very
happy
he
believes
in
me
and
trusts
me
it
will
be
a
great
blow
to
him
as
to
me
i
know
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
spare
him
this
misery
but
in
common
honesty
i
can
not
and
have
you
thought
of
what
is
to
become
of
me
when
i
am
turned
out
of
my
husband
house
she
inquired
in
a
composed
voice
her
adroit
mind
had
evidently
adapted
itself
to
the
altered
circumstances
and
was
now
busied
in
turning
them
as
far
as
possible
to
her
own
advantage
you
have
george
dutton
to
fall
back
upon
also
tommie
esmond
was
murchison
retort
she
snapped
her
fingers
in
a
fashion
that
was
almost
vulgar
and
she
was
so
free
from
vulgar
actions
george
is
thankful
that
i
can
from
time
to
time
fling
him
a
note
his
luck
has
deserted
him
tommie
esmond
i
believe
saved
a
bit
out
of
the
wreck
but
he
has
not
more
than
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
guy
is
not
a
man
to
behave
ungenerously
however
deeply
he
has
been
wronged
said
hugh
after
he
had
reflected
a
few
moments
he
added
more
hesitatingly
and
if
guy
should
take
an
obdurate
attitude
it
is
possible
i
might
come
to
your
assistance
i
have
hunted
you
down
but
i
do
not
want
to
drive
you
into
the
gutter
but
a
man
must
support
his
wife
even
if
her
past
has
not
been
quite
so
respectable
as
it
might
have
been
she
cried
defiantly
hugh
directed
upon
her
a
searching
look
spencer
it
is
in
my
mind
that
you
may
not
be
guy
wife
after
all
if
i
probed
a
little
deeper
i
might
get
at
your
real
relations
with
this
george
dutton
or
rather
burton
oh
this
time
you
are
really
pursuing
a
i
assure
you
george
has
never
been
anything
to
me
but
brother
or
cousin
as
the
occasion
demanded
she
paused
a
second
and
there
was
a
terrified
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
added
but
even
if
your
suspicions
were
correct
which
they
are
not
you
would
not
go
back
from
your
own
promise
if
guy
proved
obdurate
you
would
not
drive
me
to
the
gutter
you
promised
me
that
i
shall
keep
my
promise
spencer
and
i
will
give
it
you
in
writing
if
you
wish
it
would
be
as
well
and
you
will
want
something
from
me
in
writing
also
i
expect
she
concluded
shrewdly
certainly
i
shall
said
hugh
steadily
i
shall
draw
up
a
full
confession
for
you
to
sign
to
prevent
you
from
ever
troubling
your
husband
again
if
as
i
suggested
just
now
he
is
your
husband
spencer
rose
it
seemed
that
there
was
a
sense
of
relief
in
the
fact
that
the
interview
was
ending
so
amicably
i
would
have
preferred
to
remain
as
i
am
but
on
the
whole
the
life
does
suit
me
luxurious
as
it
is
i
am
very
fond
of
guy
really
he
has
been
so
good
to
me
but
i
have
alienated
him
from
his
friends
and
i
have
to
sit
here
hour
after
hour
by
myself
with
only
my
thoughts
for
company
let
us
say
one
week
from
now
i
will
have
that
confession
ready
to
sign
and
you
will
bring
it
here
suggested
stella
i
think
not
it
will
take
some
time
to
read
through
and
we
might
be
interrupted
was
hugh
answer
at
your
hotel
then
i
suppose
was
the
young
woman
next
suggestion
the
same
objection
applies
he
scribbled
down
an
address
on
a
piece
of
paper
meet
me
there
this
day
week
at
the
hour
i
have
appointed
nobody
will
interrupt
us
i
will
take
care
of
that
and
spencer
lay
awake
half
the
night
working
out
a
problem
that
had
suggested
itself
to
her
in
a
flash
the
next
day
she
lunched
with
george
dutton
in
the
city
the
detective
might
be
watching
her
but
did
it
matter
whatever
happened
at
the
end
of
the
week
she
had
burned
her
boats
chapter
xx
months
had
elapsed
since
the
meeting
between
major
murchison
and
stella
spencer
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
a
handsome
man
of
about
thirty
was
travelling
up
from
manchester
to
london
the
reason
of
his
journey
was
his
desire
to
visit
his
sister
caroline
masters
who
occupied
a
small
flat
in
the
neighbourhood
of
king
cross
up
to
a
short
time
ago
this
handsome
man
had
been
leading
a
very
quiet
life
in
the
busy
city
of
manchester
he
was
an
electrician
by
trade
and
a
very
clever
one
he
was
civil
intelligent
beyond
his
station
but
he
had
not
forgathered
much
with
his
had
kept
himself
very
much
to
himself
and
yet
strange
to
say
this
had
not
provoked
suspicion
or
resentment
on
the
part
of
his
daily
associates
reginald
davis
for
such
was
his
name
had
been
unjustly
suspected
of
murder
and
the
police
had
been
hot
on
his
track
then
had
come
the
suicide
in
no
cathcart
square
and
his
sister
caroline
masters
had
identified
the
dead
body
as
that
of
her
brother
caroline
masters
had
always
been
a
plucky
resourceful
girl
and
devoted
to
him
the
dead
man
no
doubt
bore
some
resemblance
to
himself
and
she
had
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
swear
to
a
false
identification
and
remove
from
him
the
sleepless
vigilance
of
the
police
this
much
she
had
conveyed
to
him
in
a
guarded
letter
reginald
davis
the
man
falsely
accused
of
murder
was
dead
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
in
a
sense
he
had
nothing
further
to
fear
but
at
the
same
time
caution
must
be
observed
the
few
friends
he
had
were
in
london
at
any
time
he
might
run
across
one
or
more
of
them
so
taking
another
name
he
had
hidden
himself
in
manchester
and
corresponded
secretly
with
the
one
of
the
two
sisters
he
could
trust
caroline
masters
and
then
suddenly
the
burden
had
been
lifted
from
his
soul
there
was
a
small
paragraph
in
the
evening
newspapers
afterwards
reproduced
in
the
morning
ones
which
told
him
that
he
need
not
skulk
through
the
world
any
longer
a
man
lying
under
sentence
of
death
for
a
brutal
murder
and
without
hope
of
reprieve
had
confessed
to
the
crime
of
which
davis
had
been
falsely
accused
in
the
paragraph
which
was
of
course
essentially
the
same
in
all
the
papers
were
a
few
words
of
sympathy
for
the
unfortunate
reginald
davis
who
had
stolen
into
no
cathcart
square
and
committed
suicide
under
a
sense
of
abject
terror
the
police
had
carefully
investigated
the
statements
of
the
condemned
man
with
the
result
that
they
found
the
late
reginald
davis
absolutely
innocent
the
late
reginald
davis
very
alive
and
well
knocked
at
the
door
of
his
sister
flat
she
had
been
apprised
of
his
coming
and
greeted
him
affectionately
she
sat
him
down
before
a
supper
he
was
hungry
and
ate
heartily
she
did
not
disturb
him
with
much
conversation
till
he
had
finished
then
she
spoke
well
reggie
that
was
a
bit
of
luck
indeed
she
was
of
course
alluding
to
the
confession
of
the
real
murderer
now
you
are
as
free
as
air
you
were
always
a
bit
of
a
bad
egg
old
boy
but
never
a
criminal
to
that
extent
no
hang
it
all
i
am
not
particular
in
a
general
way
but
murder
was
not
in
my
line
he
answered
briefly
it
was
hard
lines
to
get
of
the
other
things
and
then
to
be
suspected
of
that
at
the
end
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
by
jove
carrie
you
were
always
the
cleverest
of
the
lot
of
us
that
was
a
of
yours
walking
in
and
identifying
me
as
the
suicide
masters
smiled
appreciatively
yes
it
came
to
me
in
a
flash
i
read
the
account
in
the
papers
it
struck
me
i
might
do
something
useful
i
went
up
to
the
court
with
the
tale
of
a
missing
brother
i
saw
the
body
the
poor
creature
might
have
been
your
twin
of
course
i
swore
it
was
you
and
gave
you
a
new
lease
of
life
she
added
severely
i
hope
you
have
taken
advantage
of
what
i
did
and
become
a
reformed
character
davis
spoke
very
gravely
yes
carrie
i
swear
to
you
i
have
that
shock
was
the
making
of
me
i
have
lain
very
low
worked
hard
and
put
by
money
he
pulled
out
an
envelope
from
his
breastpocket
and
thrust
it
into
her
hand
it
was
full
of
notes
fifty
of
the
best
old
girl
for
a
little
i
have
not
forgotten
my
best
pal
you
see
the
tears
came
into
masters
eyes
he
had
been
a
bad
egg
but
he
had
a
good
heart
at
bottom
that
is
very
sweet
of
you
reggie
it
will
come
in
very
useful
and
now
to
go
back
for
a
moment
to
cathart
square
who
was
the
poor
devil
who
killed
himself
there
he
was
as
like
you
as
two
peas
are
like
each
other
i
think
we
have
got
to
find
that
out
said
reginald
davis
gravely
nor
reading
the
account
in
the
papers
am
i
quite
sure
that
it
was
a
suicide
but
that
was
the
verdict
interrupted
the
sister
i
know
but
there
are
peculiar
things
about
the
case
letters
addressed
to
reginald
davis
were
found
on
him
there
was
a
letter
signed
reginald
davis
addressed
to
the
coroner
announcing
his
intention
to
commit
suicide
those
letters
had
been
placed
there
by
the
person
who
murdered
him
and
that
person
who
murdered
him
was
somebody
who
knew
me
unless
it
was
the
accidental
taking
of
a
common
name
but
the
razor
was
clutched
in
his
hand
reggie
quite
easy
replied
davis
who
if
not
a
murderer
himself
could
easily
project
himself
apparently
into
the
mind
of
one
we
will
assume
for
the
moment
it
was
a
man
he
cut
the
poor
devil
throat
and
then
thrust
the
razor
into
his
stiffening
hand
to
convey
the
idea
of
suicide
it
might
be
agreed
masters
well
carrie
one
thing
i
have
fixed
on
and
it
is
one
of
the
things
for
which
i
have
come
up
i
go
to
scotland
yard
tell
them
straight
i
am
reginald
davis
without
a
stain
upon
my
character
explain
to
them
that
you
were
misled
by
a
close
resemblance
we
will
have
that
body
exhumed
i
am
firmly
convinced
it
was
a
murder
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
reggie
advised
masters
who
had
a
horror
of
the
law
and
its
subtle
ways
never
mind
who
was
the
poor
devil
who
was
found
there
whether
he
was
murdered
or
committed
suicide
it
is
no
affair
of
yours
it
is
an
affair
of
mine
in
this
way
replied
davis
in
a
dogged
tone
the
person
who
murdered
the
poor
devil
as
you
call
him
knew
something
about
me
and
took
a
liberty
with
my
name
it
served
you
a
good
turn
reggie
anyway
i
know
i
admit
that
but
the
murderer
did
not
know
he
was
doing
me
thanks
to
you
a
good
turn
when
he
killed
the
other
fellow
masters
thought
deeply
for
a
few
moments
reggie
you
have
been
a
very
bad
egg
i
am
sure
i
shall
never
guess
a
quarter
of
what
you
have
been
guilty
of
he
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
her
arm
well
for
you
old
girl
you
ca
that
is
all
past
and
done
with
by
the
way
that
letter
found
on
the
poor
chap
announcing
his
intention
to
commit
suicide
did
they
ask
you
to
identify
my
handwriting
of
course
the
others
addressed
to
him
did
matter
much
anybody
could
have
written
them
but
my
letter
was
a
forgery
did
they
ask
you
to
identify
that
particular
letter
they
did
reggie
and
my
brain
was
in
such
a
whirl
that
i
could
hardly
read
it
i
said
that
i
believed
it
was
in
your
handwriting
it
was
certainly
very
like
although
as
you
can
imagine
i
looked
at
it
through
a
sort
of
mist
anyway
it
was
as
like
your
handwriting
as
the
dead
man
was
like
you
davis
ruminated
for
a
few
moments
that
letter
was
forged
by
somebody
who
knew
me
and
could
imitate
my
hand
to
a
nicety
i
am
thinking
of
all
the
i
knew
in
the
old
days
i
think
i
can
fix
him
yes
said
masters
breathlessly
she
was
capable
of
great
daring
in
the
cause
and
the
service
of
those
she
loved
but
she
was
not
habituated
to
the
ways
of
hardened
criminals
a
man
i
was
a
bit
associated
with
in
the
old
days
luckily
he
drag
me
in
far
enough
he
was
an
expert
forger
we
used
to
call
him
the
penman
masters
shuddered
oh
you
poor
weak
soul
you
were
so
near
it
as
that
very
near
carrie
the
shock
of
the
false
accusation
of
murder
pulled
me
up
straight
i
saw
where
i
was
drifting
and
made
up
my
mind
that
the
straight
path
was
the
surest
at
the
moment
that
davis
gave
utterance
to
this
honourable
sentiment
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
masters
rose
at
once
it
is
iris
i
dropped
her
a
note
to
say
you
were
coming
she
will
be
so
pleased
to
see
you
there
floated
into
the
small
a
very
dainty
and
ethereal
figure
miss
iris
deane
a
charming
member
of
the
chorus
at
the
frivolity
theatre
she
flung
her
arms
round
the
neck
of
her
handsome
brother
oh
reggie
dear
what
a
treat
to
see
you
and
all
this
dreadful
thing
is
lifted
from
you
iris
was
not
his
favourite
sister
she
was
clever
in
a
worldly
way
and
had
made
good
but
she
had
not
the
sterling
loyalty
of
caroline
davis
gently
checked
her
enthusiasm
and
how
have
you
been
getting
on
iris
always
floating
on
the
top
as
usual
miss
iris
showed
her
dimples
always
floating
on
the
top
as
you
say
dear
old
boy
a
silly
soft
chap
fell
in
love
with
me
wrote
most
impassioned
well
he
was
too
soppy
for
me
to
care
much
about
him
and
when
his
rich
brother
came
along
offering
me
a
price
for
his
i
can
tell
you
i
just
jumped
at
the
chance
did
you
get
a
good
price
queried
her
brother
i
stuck
out
for
ten
thousand
explained
the
capable
iris
but
this
chap
was
a
good
bargainer
and
i
let
them
go
at
seven
it
was
better
on
the
whole
if
i
had
married
roddie
i
should
have
been
so
in
a
month
that
i
should
have
run
away
from
him
and
then
heaven
knows
where
i
might
have
ended
davis
looked
at
his
sister
approvingly
there
was
enough
of
the
old
adam
left
in
him
to
entertain
a
slight
envy
of
his
sister
chances
seven
thousand
pounds
a
little
fortune
in
itself
was
a
good
bit
of
work
a
handsome
reward
for
the
display
of
her
dimples
roddie
who
dear
you
might
tell
us
his
other
name
queried
masters
who
perhaps
was
also
smitten
with
a
sense
of
envy
that
telling
answered
the
sprightly
iris
who
was
not
given
to
be
too
frank
about
her
own
affairs
but
if
either
of
you
two
dear
things
want
a
little
ready
apply
to
me
of
course
you
will
remember
i
have
got
to
take
care
of
myself
to
make
provision
for
my
old
age
davis
and
carrie
exchanged
glances
they
knew
the
volatile
iris
of
old
as
a
child
she
had
always
been
mean
and
grasping
not
much
of
the
seven
thousand
would
come
their
way
if
they
were
on
the
verge
of
starvation
carrie
spoke
in
cold
accents
you
are
really
too
generous
iris
but
we
shall
not
have
to
trespass
upon
your
generosity
i
have
enough
for
my
humble
wants
and
reggie
has
been
able
to
put
by
so
much
so
that
he
has
been
kind
enough
to
make
me
a
very
handsome
money
present
dear
old
reggie
said
the
sweetly
smiling
iris
i
am
so
glad
you
have
made
good
and
then
davis
spoke
thanks
in
great
part
to
carrie
who
told
that
splendid
lie
about
the
suicide
or
murder
at
cathcart
square
you
remember
that
of
course
suicide
was
it
said
iris
but
her
cheek
had
grown
a
little
pale
i
do
think
so
there
was
a
forged
letter
purporting
to
be
written
by
me
i
am
going
to
scotland
yard
stating
frankly
who
i
am
and
urging
them
to
exhume
the
body
we
will
find
out
who
the
man
buried
under
the
name
of
reginald
davis
really
was
and
then
the
agitation
of
his
younger
sister
became
extreme
she
clutched
convulsively
at
his
arm
reggie
you
will
not
do
this
what
does
it
matter
to
you
who
the
man
was
go
under
some
other
name
and
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
unconsciously
she
had
used
the
same
expression
as
masters
but
from
different
motives
i
have
been
under
a
different
name
for
a
longer
time
than
i
care
to
remember
answered
davis
doggedly
i
have
a
fancy
to
resume
my
own
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
the
police
they
have
nothing
else
to
charge
me
with
iris
fell
on
her
knees
and
the
tears
rained
down
her
cheeks
for
my
sake
reggie
if
not
for
your
own
and
why
for
your
sake
tell
us
what
you
mean
demanded
her
brother
sternly
and
iris
spoke
as
clearly
as
she
could
speak
amidst
her
strangled
sobs
if
you
try
and
unearth
that
mystery
at
cathcart
square
i
might
be
dragged
in
and
it
might
be
very
awkward
for
me
chapter
xxi
directed
a
keen
glance
at
his
elder
sister
over
the
bowed
head
of
iris
the
younger
woman
was
by
no
means
of
an
emotional
nature
light
frivolous
and
volatile
she
had
danced
through
life
and
on
the
whole
had
had
a
good
time
one
could
not
picture
her
in
a
tragic
mood
and
yet
she
was
the
personification
of
deep
emotion
now
she
could
hardly
speak
for
those
convulsive
sobs
and
in
her
frightened
eyes
there
was
a
deep
and
haunting
terror
at
what
point
and
through
what
circumstances
had
tragedy
touched
this
little
selfish
butterfly
gifted
with
a
certain
amount
of
cunning
and
sharpness
but
utterly
brainless
what
do
you
know
of
no
cathcart
square
except
what
you
gleaned
from
the
newspapers
demanded
her
brother
sternly
how
can
you
be
implicated
in
the
murder
of
the
unknown
man
whom
carrie
mistook
for
me
but
carrie
did
not
mistake
him
for
you
wailed
iris
she
told
me
afterwards
that
the
idea
suggested
itself
in
a
flash
and
when
she
read
the
newspaper
she
was
not
sure
whether
it
was
you
who
had
crept
in
there
according
to
the
evidence
and
made
away
with
yourself
through
fear
of
the
police
leave
carrie
out
of
it
for
the
moment
said
davis
whatever
she
did
was
well
thought
out
of
course
we
both
know
her
object
was
to
identify
me
if
possible
and
put
scotland
yard
off
the
scent
what
we
want
to
know
is
how
did
you
come
to
be
acquainted
with
the
house
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
if
further
investigations
are
made
you
might
be
dragged
in
i
was
there
on
four
occasions
on
the
last
a
few
days
before
the
murder
or
suicide
whatever
it
was
davis
gasped
and
carrie
lifted
her
hands
in
horror
what
did
this
confession
mean
it
was
impossible
that
this
slim
weak
girl
had
herself
been
the
murderess
could
have
killed
a
big
powerful
man
of
the
same
build
as
the
supposed
davis
with
those
slim
weak
hands
she
saw
the
horror
in
their
faces
and
hastened
to
reassure
them
oh
no
not
that
i
swear
to
you
i
am
no
more
a
murderess
than
you
were
a
murderer
reggie
but
if
the
whole
thing
is
raked
up
and
the
man
whom
i
believe
it
to
be
accurately
identified
this
time
things
might
look
very
black
for
me
davis
lifted
her
from
her
kneeling
position
and
placed
her
in
an
calm
yourself
and
tell
us
the
whole
story
of
why
and
how
you
came
to
be
in
cathcart
square
at
all
iris
waited
a
few
moments
till
the
convulsive
sobbing
ceased
she
spoke
with
little
occasional
gasps
but
it
was
very
evident
it
was
a
relief
to
unbosom
herself
it
is
a
very
long
story
she
began
tremulously
if
the
telling
of
it
lasts
till
midnight
we
must
have
it
said
her
brother
in
an
inflexible
voice
and
compelled
by
his
resolute
manner
the
girl
whom
they
had
always
regarded
as
a
frivolous
butterfly
embarked
upon
her
strange
and
thrilling
narrative
it
all
arose
out
of
the
sale
of
those
letters
i
spoke
to
you
about
carrie
just
now
asked
me
the
name
of
the
man
who
wrote
them
well
i
did
get
further
than
roddie
which
does
carry
you
very
far
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
threat
of
going
to
scotland
yard
i
should
have
stopped
at
that
a
still
tongue
makes
a
wise
head
you
know
they
could
quite
believe
that
in
spite
of
her
ceaseless
chatter
iris
had
always
been
very
reticent
about
her
own
affairs
she
had
seen
next
to
nothing
of
her
brother
for
a
few
years
not
very
much
of
carrie
masters
and
on
these
occasions
she
had
always
avoided
in
a
marked
manner
any
allusion
to
her
private
affairs
i
told
you
of
a
soppy
young
chap
who
started
to
make
love
to
me
last
year
i
did
care
a
snap
for
him
but
he
was
very
persistent
and
at
last
wrote
me
most
urgent
letters
imploring
me
to
be
his
wife
his
full
name
was
roderick
murchison
a
member
of
the
great
brewing
family
his
father
has
been
dead
for
some
time
he
died
during
the
war
and
roddie
came
in
for
tons
of
money
although
he
was
not
the
eldest
son
i
know
if
you
have
ever
heard
of
him
no
neither
davis
nor
carrie
had
known
of
the
existence
of
such
a
young
man
they
had
a
hazy
idea
that
there
was
a
big
brewing
firm
of
that
name
that
was
all
well
as
i
say
i
did
care
a
snap
for
him
although
he
was
awfully
good
and
generous
overwhelmed
me
with
all
kinds
of
lovely
presents
rings
bracelets
fur
coats
etc
in
our
life
you
know
one
accepts
these
things
from
the
mugs
who
are
gone
on
us
without
attaching
very
much
importance
to
the
fact
it
was
evident
that
miss
iris
had
struck
out
her
own
line
of
life
and
made
a
very
good
thing
out
of
it
well
then
roddie
began
to
grow
desperate
and
declared
he
live
without
me
it
was
all
so
genuine
that
at
last
i
began
to
think
seriously
of
it
there
were
tons
of
money
and
although
i
did
cotton
much
to
the
sort
of
life
i
should
have
to
lead
as
his
wife
still
there
were
worse
things
than
being
roderick
murchison
with
the
future
well
assured
and
a
handsome
settlement
davis
and
his
elder
sister
exchanged
wondering
glances
so
this
butterfly
little
girl
whom
they
had
always
regarded
as
rather
shallow
and
had
had
this
wonderful
chance
of
marrying
a
gentleman
and
a
rich
man
it
was
difficult
to
bring
myself
up
to
the
scratch
in
spite
of
the
advantages
for
he
was
so
soft
and
soppy
that
he
irritated
me
in
a
ways
and
i
knew
in
a
very
short
time
i
should
grow
to
hate
and
despise
him
then
one
night
after
a
very
excellent
champagne
supper
at
the
he
got
me
in
a
yielding
mood
and
i
promised
to
marry
him
brother
and
sister
could
only
marvel
at
the
girl
extraordinary
good
fortune
reluctant
as
she
seemed
to
avail
herself
of
it
he
told
me
that
before
he
went
to
bed
that
night
he
wrote
to
his
family
acquainting
them
with
the
news
anticipating
fully
their
objections
but
expressing
his
strong
determination
to
brook
no
interference
or
remonstrance
you
see
he
was
his
own
master
nobody
could
take
his
money
away
from
him
and
he
did
care
whether
his
relatives
were
offended
or
not
and
how
did
the
family
take
it
queried
davis
i
am
coming
to
that
replied
iris
she
was
growing
much
calmer
now
it
was
a
relief
to
unburden
her
secret
to
an
audience
whom
she
could
trust
for
she
was
sure
that
neither
her
brother
nor
sister
would
ever
allow
her
to
put
herself
into
real
danger
i
am
coming
to
that
she
repeated
a
few
days
after
he
had
written
those
letters
one
to
his
widowed
mother
one
to
his
elder
brother
who
had
inherited
the
bulk
of
the
big
fortune
the
elder
brother
called
upon
me
in
my
flat
he
was
a
very
handsome
man
although
he
had
been
through
a
good
deal
in
the
war
he
was
very
like
you
reggie
ah
ejaculated
davis
he
looked
at
carrie
keenly
watching
her
sister
with
a
glance
that
suggested
they
would
soon
be
coming
to
the
real
pith
of
this
rambling
confession
he
begged
the
favour
of
a
short
conversation
he
was
perfectly
open
and
he
told
me
straight
he
was
roddie
elder
brother
and
that
his
name
was
hugh
murchison
he
pointed
out
to
me
very
kindly
that
his
brother
was
an
impetuous
young
ass
a
judgment
which
i
privately
endorsed
that
roddie
had
been
infatuated
in
his
short
day
with
quite
a
number
of
other
girls
although
perhaps
not
to
the
same
extent
as
with
me
iris
getting
back
rapidly
into
her
light
mind
let
her
volatile
and
easily
impressed
nature
peep
out
in
her
next
words
oh
hugh
murchison
was
a
darling
so
quiet
so
sensible
and
so
strong
if
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
ask
me
to
marry
him
i
would
not
have
given
him
up
for
seven
thousand
pounds
but
you
were
prepared
to
chuck
roddie
for
that
suggested
her
brother
quietly
i
think
i
let
him
go
a
bit
too
cheap
answered
the
fair
iris
in
a
reflective
voice
many
girls
have
got
more
than
i
asked
for
compromising
a
breach
of
promise
but
to
tell
the
absolute
truth
hugh
murchison
hypnotised
me
a
bit
he
was
so
quiet
and
yet
so
strong
that
i
felt
he
could
twist
me
round
his
little
finger
we
want
to
get
to
cathcart
square
interjected
davis
a
little
impatiently
we
do
seem
to
be
near
it
yet
i
must
tell
my
story
my
own
way
it
is
no
use
driving
me
replied
iris
pouting
a
little
well
as
i
tell
you
he
called
that
day
at
my
flat
that
was
the
beginning
of
negotiations
where
were
we
to
meet
to
discuss
details
i
could
have
him
at
my
flat
because
roddie
was
always
popping
in
and
out
he
could
have
me
at
his
hotel
because
nobody
knew
whom
we
might
come
across
and
roddie
was
always
coming
there
he
said
he
would
think
out
a
plan
and
telephone
or
wire
me
ah
said
carrie
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
was
a
very
practical
person
now
i
suppose
we
are
coming
to
it
iris
heedless
of
the
interruption
went
on
with
her
story
next
day
he
me
up
and
after
ascertaining
that
i
was
quite
alone
told
me
to
meet
him
at
cathcart
square
to
resume
our
conversation
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
wonderful
began
reginald
davis
but
his
sister
motioned
him
to
silence
do
interrupt
please
you
will
know
everything
in
a
few
minutes
i
went
to
no
cathcart
square
at
the
time
appointed
he
opened
the
door
himself
it
was
a
big
house
in
an
square
ages
old
i
should
say
and
in
the
front
court
was
an
agent
board
intimating
that
this
particular
house
was
to
let
furnished
i
know
cathcart
square
well
it
in
an
quarter
of
kensington
interrupted
davis
he
added
grimly
i
know
it
well
although
i
did
not
have
the
misfortune
to
commit
suicide
there
he
told
me
a
very
funny
story
the
afternoon
of
the
day
before
he
had
been
up
to
kensington
to
visit
an
old
nurse
of
the
family
who
lived
near
by
he
had
strolled
round
to
cathcart
square
to
fill
up
an
idle
he
had
been
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
house
and
loitered
before
it
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
a
somewhat
caretaker
came
out
davis
indulged
in
a
sigh
of
relief
we
are
really
coming
to
it
now
then
yes
you
are
coming
to
it
he
told
me
a
sudden
idea
had
occurred
to
him
here
would
be
a
quiet
little
spot
for
our
meetings
a
place
where
roddie
would
never
dream
of
following
us
he
accosted
the
caretaker
evidently
a
drunken
and
corrupt
creature
he
explained
that
he
wanted
to
rent
a
couple
of
rooms
where
he
could
receive
a
certain
visitor
he
was
expecting
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
or
fortnight
it
was
no
use
going
to
the
house
agents
for
that
they
would
turn
down
such
a
proposition
the
caretaker
with
a
couple
of
notes
in
his
hand
took
an
intelligent
view
of
the
situation
he
gave
hugh
a
key
and
intimated
that
if
he
had
sufficient
notice
he
would
make
himself
scarce
on
the
occasions
when
the
visitor
was
expected
of
all
the
mad
things
began
davis
but
his
sister
for
the
second
time
motioned
her
brother
to
silence
not
quite
so
mad
as
you
think
i
fancy
i
can
see
into
his
mind
we
could
have
met
at
a
dozen
different
restaurants
in
london
but
roddie
was
here
there
and
everywhere
at
any
moment
he
might
have
come
across
us
he
would
never
get
as
far
as
kensington
david
nodded
his
sagacious
head
i
think
i
see
go
on
i
met
him
there
in
all
four
times
the
last
meeting
was
a
few
days
before
the
tragedy
and
what
took
place
at
that
meeting
he
paid
me
the
seven
thousand
pounds
in
notes
i
signed
a
paper
agreeing
to
give
roddie
up
i
carried
out
my
bargain
i
wrote
roddie
that
same
night
giving
him
his
dismissal
and
assuring
him
that
nothing
he
could
urge
would
induce
me
to
reconsider
my
determination
he
sent
me
frantic
telegrams
the
next
day
but
i
replied
to
the
same
effect
after
taking
his
seven
thousand
pounds
i
could
not
break
faith
with
hugh
could
i
davis
was
not
quite
sure
that
iris
would
not
break
faith
with
anybody
if
it
suited
her
purpose
but
clearly
hugh
murchison
had
subjugated
her
to
the
extent
of
respecting
an
honourable
bargain
no
doubt
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
so
far
as
a
person
of
her
shallow
temperament
could
fall
in
love
and
what
has
become
of
roddie
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
he
has
bored
me
to
extinction
for
over
nine
months
i
am
glad
to
be
shut
of
him
davis
put
a
question
you
say
hugh
murchison
paid
you
in
notes
what
have
you
done
with
them
his
bank
will
have
the
numbers
will
they
cried
iris
the
frightened
look
again
coming
into
her
eyes
she
knew
nothing
of
business
methods
i
paid
them
into
my
own
account
now
you
see
if
you
rake
this
up
i
might
be
implicated
your
opinion
is
then
that
the
man
found
in
no
cathcart
square
was
hugh
murchison
i
am
as
nearly
sure
as
i
can
be
after
reading
the
evidence
he
had
some
other
stunt
on
beside
my
own
i
was
not
the
only
visitor
he
received
davis
thought
deeply
before
he
spoke
if
i
have
him
dug
up
and
he
is
identified
by
those
who
know
him
a
lot
will
come
to
light
your
notes
will
be
traced
for
one
thing
i
am
afraid
of
everything
reggie
for
the
love
of
heaven
let
him
rest
where
he
is
caroline
masters
breathed
softly
to
herself
you
were
half
in
love
with
him
or
perhaps
and
you
do
want
to
know
the
real
truth
oh
you
miserable
little
paltry
soul
and
then
a
sudden
thought
came
to
davis
now
iris
you
could
never
think
very
clearly
about
things
when
they
got
a
little
bit
complicated
you
are
quite
sure
the
last
occasion
on
which
you
saw
him
was
a
few
days
before
the
discovery
of
the
body
i
will
swear
to
it
cried
iris
firmly
the
date
of
his
cheque
which
the
bank
has
will
show
that
he
probably
cashed
it
himself
on
the
day
he
paid
you
any
way
the
day
before
now
on
the
day
preceding
and
the
day
following
that
tragedy
can
you
prove
where
you
were
iris
began
to
see
light
of
course
i
can
the
day
after
i
had
the
notes
i
got
up
a
sprained
ankle
an
obliging
doctor
an
old
or
rather
young
friend
of
mine
sent
a
certificate
to
the
theatre
i
motored
down
to
brighton
with
johnny
lascelles
who
by
the
way
used
to
make
roddie
fearfully
jealous
we
joined
a
jolly
little
party
at
old
ship
i
came
back
the
day
after
the
discovery
in
cathcart
square
davis
rose
and
gave
a
great
shout
you
have
witnesses
who
can
swear
to
that
of
course
answered
iris
not
even
yet
comprehending
the
full
drift
of
the
question
johnny
lascelles
motored
me
there
and
drove
me
back
then
there
was
cissy
monteith
katie
havard
jack
legard
and
others
who
were
with
me
all
the
time
you
silly
little
idiot
cried
reginald
davis
and
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
you
might
be
implicated
the
notes
she
faltered
my
meeting
him
alone
in
that
empty
house
they
might
suggest
i
murdered
him
if
you
say
he
was
murdered
davis
smote
his
forehead
in
impotent
anger
at
her
denseness
how
could
you
have
murdered
him
when
you
were
at
brighton
all
the
time
he
smote
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
i
will
find
out
who
the
dead
man
was
and
also
the
man
who
forged
my
name
to
that
letter
to
the
coroner
he
turned
to
his
sister
as
for
you
young
woman
it
may
be
you
will
have
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
if
it
all
comes
out
about
roddie
but
never
mind
you
will
have
a
splendid
advertisement
the
next
bunch
of
letters
you
get
hold
of
the
price
will
be
twice
seven
thousand
pounds
chapter
xii
following
morning
reginald
davis
resolved
to
unearth
the
mystery
of
square
stood
in
the
private
room
of
bryant
of
scotland
yard
he
had
easily
overcome
his
younger
sister
scruples
her
terror
at
having
to
give
evidence
in
a
court
of
justice
and
being
forced
to
disclose
certain
transactions
not
too
creditable
to
herself
she
had
come
to
see
from
the
point
of
view
artfully
suggested
by
davis
that
on
the
whole
it
would
be
a
very
good
advertisement
it
might
even
take
her
from
her
place
in
the
chorus
to
a
small
acting
part
and
then
her
fortune
would
be
made
she
might
be
able
to
come
across
another
rich
man
whom
she
would
like
well
enough
to
marry
a
man
quite
different
from
the
somewhat
invertebrate
roddie
bryant
looked
up
from
his
papers
and
regarded
the
young
man
with
his
keen
and
steady
gaze
davis
good
looks
and
frank
air
impressed
him
favourably
well
my
man
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
do
usually
see
strangers
who
approach
me
in
such
a
mysterious
fashion
you
would
neither
state
your
name
nor
business
only
said
vaguely
that
you
wanted
to
interview
me
on
a
matter
of
great
urgency
i
wished
to
keep
my
business
for
your
private
ear
sir
can
you
throw
your
mind
back
to
a
certain
gruesome
affair
that
happened
at
cathcart
square
certainly
although
i
was
not
in
charge
of
the
matter
the
man
was
identified
as
reginald
davis
who
was
wanted
on
a
charge
of
murder
the
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
being
very
strong
the
verdict
returned
was
one
of
suicide
if
i
recollect
rightly
he
had
broken
a
pane
of
glass
in
one
of
the
back
windows
of
the
house
unhasped
the
latch
of
the
window
and
cut
his
throat
upstairs
after
he
got
inside
the
facts
were
accepted
at
the
time
as
conclusive
evidence
of
his
guilt
and
you
recollect
sir
what
happened
a
short
time
ago
with
regard
to
the
crime
of
which
reginald
davis
was
accused
perfectly
the
real
criminal
has
confessed
and
this
poor
devil
overwhelmed
no
doubt
by
the
circumstantial
evidence
which
told
so
strongly
against
him
acted
too
hastily
if
the
police
had
caught
him
he
would
probably
have
been
hanged
by
now
said
davis
a
little
bitterly
bryant
looked
a
little
uneasy
i
should
say
it
is
more
than
probable
from
what
i
remember
of
the
case
well
you
know
the
law
makes
mistakes
at
times
i
will
admit
and
juries
at
inquests
make
mistakes
at
times
also
remarked
davis
quietly
this
particular
jury
made
a
mistake
the
dead
man
was
no
more
reginald
davis
than
you
are
it
was
not
easy
to
startle
bryant
he
had
been
through
too
many
strange
experiences
for
that
but
he
exhibited
a
mild
surprise
as
he
put
the
question
and
what
authority
have
you
for
saying
that
i
think
you
will
admit
the
best
i
who
stand
before
you
am
the
reginald
davis
who
was
wanted
on
that
false
charge
of
murder
and
branded
by
that
intelligent
jury
as
a
suicide
you
can
prove
this
of
course
i
mean
that
you
are
the
real
reginald
davis
of
course
i
can
sir
i
can
bring
a
dozen
witnesses
if
necessary
half
of
whom
have
known
me
since
a
boy
needless
to
say
that
a
man
of
bryant
experience
did
not
as
a
rule
believe
one
quarter
of
what
he
was
told
but
this
man
face
this
tones
convinced
him
that
he
was
listening
to
the
truth
he
rose
from
his
chair
wait
here
a
moment
please
while
i
hunt
up
the
particulars
of
this
case
as
i
told
you
just
now
i
was
not
in
charge
of
it
and
i
should
like
to
refresh
my
memory
as
to
certain
details
he
came
back
after
a
few
moments
i
know
it
all
now
from
a
to
z
you
were
identified
by
a
married
sister
a
masters
who
gave
some
details
of
your
career
which
did
not
seem
to
have
been
a
very
healthy
one
she
was
also
shown
a
letter
which
you
were
supposed
to
have
written
to
the
coroner
and
she
believed
it
to
be
in
your
handwriting
this
wants
some
explanation
i
think
davis
to
call
you
by
the
name
which
you
say
is
your
right
one
quite
so
sir
answered
reginald
composedly
it
certainly
requires
a
good
deal
of
explanation
but
if
you
will
listen
to
me
with
a
little
patience
i
think
i
can
convince
you
that
the
thing
is
more
natural
than
it
appears
the
inspector
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
your
sister
who
identified
you
but
how
did
she
come
to
mistake
the
actual
suicide
for
you
and
davis
gave
the
explanation
which
bryant
might
believe
or
not
or
believe
in
part
as
he
chose
my
sister
caroline
was
deeply
attached
to
me
she
was
in
despair
when
she
heard
that
i
was
suspected
of
murder
and
was
being
hunted
by
the
police
as
day
after
day
week
after
week
went
by
and
there
was
no
news
of
my
capture
she
got
it
firmly
fixed
in
her
mind
that
i
had
committed
suicide
she
hunted
the
newspapers
every
morning
to
find
some
paragraph
that
would
confirm
her
fears
and
then
one
day
she
read
about
what
had
happened
at
cathcart
square
bryant
was
now
deeply
interested
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
his
attitude
betokened
his
eagerness
it
is
possible
that
her
mind
had
become
a
little
unhinged
by
her
anxiety
she
expected
to
find
me
and
she
found
a
man
who
might
have
passed
for
my
twin
brother
so
she
tells
me
now
that
i
have
revealed
myself
for
of
course
i
lay
very
low
until
this
belated
confession
of
the
real
murderer
bryant
only
made
a
brief
comment
on
this
particular
portion
of
the
narrative
which
davis
was
twisting
about
with
some
skill
of
course
masters
had
not
been
deceived
by
the
accidental
resemblance
but
in
pretending
to
be
she
had
given
that
brother
a
new
lease
of
life
you
say
that
the
man
was
so
like
you
that
the
sister
who
had
known
you
from
childhood
was
ready
to
swear
he
was
her
brother
there
is
no
doubt
sir
that
at
the
time
her
mind
was
clouded
she
went
there
expecting
to
find
me
and
as
a
not
altogether
unnatural
result
she
found
what
she
expected
we
will
let
that
pass
said
the
inspector
drily
no
doubt
under
extraordinary
circumstances
strange
hallucinations
are
apt
to
occur
it
was
very
fortunate
for
you
that
your
sister
made
that
mistake
and
that
it
was
accepted
as
you
admitted
just
now
if
you
had
been
caught
and
tried
it
would
have
gone
very
hardly
with
you
whatever
bryant
thought
in
his
own
mind
it
was
evident
that
he
was
prepared
to
admit
that
masters
had
acted
in
good
faith
when
she
swore
that
the
dead
man
was
her
brother
davis
could
see
there
would
be
no
trouble
on
that
score
now
we
come
to
the
letter
pursued
davis
i
questioned
my
sister
very
closely
about
that
last
night
she
says
she
was
so
overwhelmed
with
the
discovery
that
she
read
that
letter
through
a
mist
as
it
were
but
she
is
positive
that
it
closely
resembled
my
handwriting
another
hallucination
i
suppose
or
an
accidental
resemblance
well
if
you
will
leave
a
specimen
of
your
own
caligraphy
with
us
we
can
compare
them
said
bryant
and
i
suppose
sir
you
will
have
the
body
exhumed
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
who
the
man
really
was
i
suppose
so
replied
the
inspector
a
little
unwillingly
although
i
do
expect
we
shall
ever
find
out
nobody
came
forward
at
the
time
when
your
sister
made
that
mistake
is
it
likely
anybody
will
come
forward
now
some
poor
derelict
weary
of
life
i
suppose
without
kith
or
kin
to
claim
him
at
the
end
there
are
scores
of
suicides
in
the
year
davis
who
are
buried
unidentified
he
added
after
a
moment
pause
of
course
before
taking
any
such
steps
we
must
formally
prove
from
unimpeachable
testimony
that
not
only
are
you
reginald
davis
but
the
particular
reginald
davis
who
was
falsely
accused
of
murder
i
quite
understand
answered
davis
a
little
stiffly
before
i
leave
this
room
i
will
indicate
the
quarters
where
you
can
obtain
the
information
you
want
then
when
i
have
verified
that
i
will
ask
you
to
come
and
see
me
again
bryant
manner
as
he
said
these
words
indicated
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
but
davis
kept
his
seat
he
had
not
finished
yet
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
detaining
you
for
a
few
moments
longer
sir
to
impress
upon
you
the
importance
of
having
that
body
exhumed
you
may
be
correct
in
your
theory
it
is
that
of
some
poor
derelict
but
i
have
a
different
theory
altogether
the
inspector
looked
sharply
at
him
and
drew
a
deep
breath
ah
then
you
have
some
knowledge
of
something
your
visit
to
me
has
been
leading
up
to
this
eh
no
actual
knowledge
sir
but
a
surmise
that
has
i
venture
to
think
some
foundation
i
have
two
sisters
the
elder
one
i
have
already
spoken
of
to
you
there
was
a
slight
note
of
sarcasm
in
the
inspector
voice
as
he
replied
yes
masters
whose
fortunate
mistake
was
of
such
excellent
service
to
you
during
the
time
you
were
waiting
for
the
real
criminal
confession
davis
did
not
suffer
himself
to
resent
this
of
course
a
man
of
the
world
like
bryant
did
not
believe
in
this
camouflaged
story
masters
was
a
clever
young
woman
and
had
taken
advantage
of
an
accidental
resemblance
to
get
her
brother
out
of
jeopardy
my
other
sister
iris
deane
is
in
the
chorus
of
the
frivolity
theatre
i
do
suppose
you
have
ever
heard
of
her
bryant
shook
his
head
he
knew
a
great
deal
about
all
classes
of
criminals
but
young
ladies
in
the
chorus
of
the
frivolity
or
any
other
theatre
were
not
in
his
line
she
was
at
masters
house
last
night
she
came
over
especially
to
welcome
me
on
my
reintroduction
to
the
world
which
i
was
supposed
to
have
quitted
she
made
to
us
a
very
startling
confession
and
that
confession
is
intimately
associated
with
the
events
at
cathcart
square
and
this
time
bryant
was
genuinely
surprised
and
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
it
reginald
davis
he
was
beginning
to
believe
in
the
identity
now
was
evidently
a
member
of
a
very
remarkable
family
you
astound
me
davis
yourself
and
both
your
sisters
mixed
up
with
what
happened
there
it
sounds
like
a
romance
pray
proceed
davis
told
the
story
as
iris
had
told
him
carefully
concealing
the
names
of
the
two
men
concerned
in
it
for
the
moment
he
was
careful
to
point
out
that
on
the
night
of
the
suicide
she
could
establish
a
complete
and
unquestioned
alibi
bryant
turned
on
him
sharply
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
do
think
it
was
a
suicide
mr
davis
i
do
sir
and
at
present
i
ca
quite
tell
you
why
but
you
must
have
some
reason
for
thinking
that
said
bryant
in
the
same
sharp
tone
my
only
reason
is
this
if
the
man
who
was
buried
under
the
name
of
reginald
davis
is
the
man
i
believe
him
to
be
there
was
no
earthly
reason
why
he
should
commit
suicide
to
the
best
of
my
belief
he
was
murdered
for
some
motive
that
i
can
not
guess
and
the
murderer
after
cutting
his
throat
put
the
razor
in
his
stiffening
hand
it
is
a
theory
worth
thinking
about
said
bryant
who
was
beginning
to
appreciate
his
visitor
very
much
and
now
davis
the
name
of
the
man
whom
your
sister
met
in
the
empty
house
i
have
kept
that
to
the
last
to
surprise
you
you
will
know
the
name
but
i
do
suppose
you
ever
came
across
the
man
it
was
major
hugh
murchison
at
this
startling
announcement
the
inspector
literally
jumped
from
his
chair
but
i
do
know
major
hugh
murchison
he
cried
he
was
in
my
office
not
so
very
long
ago
let
me
see
when
was
it
he
turned
to
his
diary
and
verified
the
date
and
gave
it
to
reginald
davis
it
was
longer
back
than
he
thought
and
you
have
not
seen
him
since
that
day
no
answered
the
inspector
wait
a
moment
till
i
ring
up
my
friend
parkinson
i
could
undertake
the
job
he
called
on
as
it
was
quite
a
private
matter
i
handed
it
over
to
parkinson
he
rang
up
his
old
friend
and
former
colleague
davis
could
gather
enough
from
the
conversation
on
bryant
side
to
be
sure
that
a
considerable
interval
had
elapsed
since
parkinson
had
seen
his
client
bryant
sat
down
in
his
chair
davis
i
can
not
say
how
much
obliged
i
am
to
you
for
your
visit
and
the
information
you
have
given
me
now
i
know
a
great
deal
more
than
you
do
about
the
proceedings
and
movements
of
major
murchison
i
know
on
what
business
he
was
engaged
in
addition
to
that
little
matter
of
your
sister
i
will
go
into
the
inquiries
concerning
yourself
and
please
hold
yourself
at
my
disposal
give
me
an
address
where
i
can
communicate
with
you
readily
davis
did
so
and
said
to
the
inspector
after
he
had
left
bryant
gave
instructions
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
for
an
hour
and
during
that
hour
he
did
the
hardest
bit
of
thinking
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
and
now
that
davis
had
mentioned
it
the
man
did
bear
a
superficial
resemblance
to
hugh
murchison
chapter
xxiii
was
a
very
hard
nut
he
had
to
crack
thanks
to
his
peculiar
position
he
was
in
possession
of
reliable
and
exclusive
information
from
more
than
one
quarter
he
held
several
threads
in
his
capable
hands
but
would
he
be
able
to
weave
them
into
a
net
wide
enough
for
his
purpose
his
recent
interview
with
davis
had
established
the
fact
that
four
persons
were
connected
with
the
mystery
of
cathcart
square
davis
himself
caroline
masters
the
elder
sister
iris
deane
the
younger
sister
and
most
important
of
all
hugh
murchison
he
dismissed
for
the
moment
the
first
three
from
his
mind
but
hugh
murchison
with
his
resemblance
to
reginald
davis
was
the
connecting
link
between
them
and
another
set
of
actors
murchison
had
consulted
him
with
the
view
of
identifying
spencer
and
george
dutton
with
the
norah
and
george
burton
of
those
days
at
blankfield
and
he
had
identified
them
as
the
same
persons
he
had
then
handed
over
the
major
to
the
astute
parkinson
who
would
find
out
as
much
as
he
could
with
regard
to
the
present
relations
between
the
precious
pair
bryant
had
been
very
busy
of
late
and
he
had
almost
dismissed
the
murchison
episode
from
his
mind
but
when
the
major
had
completed
his
investigations
he
would
undoubtedly
take
steps
to
turn
such
a
scheming
and
unscrupulous
adventuress
out
of
her
husband
house
as
to
the
way
in
which
he
would
proceed
to
accomplish
that
purpose
bryant
of
course
had
no
knowledge
neither
did
he
know
which
murchison
would
approach
first
the
husband
or
the
wife
perhaps
both
together
one
thing
stood
out
pretty
clearly
from
the
evidence
of
iris
deane
that
she
had
met
murchison
alone
at
the
house
in
cathcart
square
a
few
days
before
the
discovery
of
the
dead
body
another
thing
also
stood
out
equally
clearly
that
the
dead
man
bore
a
remarkable
likeness
to
reginald
davis
if
not
caroline
masters
would
not
have
dared
to
perjure
herself
as
she
had
done
and
he
himself
had
recognised
the
superficial
resemblance
between
the
two
men
assuming
that
it
was
a
murder
and
not
a
suicide
and
bryant
was
beginning
to
incline
like
davis
to
the
former
theory
why
had
the
murderer
fixed
upon
the
name
of
reginald
davis
and
forged
a
letter
to
the
coroner
he
must
have
been
somebody
who
had
known
davis
at
some
time
and
was
acquainted
with
his
handwriting
like
caroline
masters
he
must
have
been
inclined
to
do
the
hunted
fugitive
a
good
turn
and
have
trusted
to
his
gratitude
to
keep
a
silent
tongue
an
hour
steady
thinking
had
cleared
his
brain
the
conclusions
he
arrived
at
were
as
follows
hugh
murchison
had
been
murdered
by
somebody
and
buried
as
a
suicide
under
the
name
of
reginald
davis
the
next
question
was
who
was
the
murderer
and
what
was
the
motive
for
committing
the
murder
here
he
could
make
a
pretty
shrewd
guess
if
murchison
had
gone
about
his
mission
in
a
straightforward
but
rather
blundering
fashion
the
motive
was
clear
enough
with
bryant
to
think
was
to
act
davis
was
having
a
week
holiday
in
london
staying
with
his
sister
masters
that
same
afternoon
the
young
man
was
again
in
the
inspector
room
in
response
to
an
urgent
summons
on
the
telephone
now
davis
i
have
been
thinking
deeply
over
this
rather
complicated
affair
of
cathcart
square
and
i
am
beginning
to
see
a
streak
or
two
of
daylight
i
told
you
this
morning
i
know
a
bit
more
about
major
murchison
than
you
do
and
there
is
just
a
chance
you
might
help
me
i
take
it
you
have
had
a
somewhat
adventurous
career
your
sister
admitted
as
much
at
the
inquest
she
said
in
fact
that
you
had
been
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
davis
hung
his
head
in
a
fashion
i
have
to
admit
it
sir
it
no
use
attempting
to
deny
it
when
carrie
gave
me
away
like
that
i
have
no
desire
to
pry
into
your
past
except
so
far
as
it
helps
me
in
my
present
quest
but
i
expect
in
your
time
you
have
associated
with
a
few
undesirable
characters
reginald
davis
admitted
the
fact
quite
frankly
now
of
course
it
is
only
just
a
chance
but
did
you
ever
come
across
a
man
named
george
burton
and
a
young
woman
who
passed
as
his
sister
my
first
knowledge
of
them
is
that
they
ran
a
gambling
saloon
in
paris
she
a
girl
acting
as
decoy
then
he
quitted
the
game
and
went
in
for
more
criminal
pursuits
i
did
know
them
sir
if
i
tell
you
what
i
do
know
am
i
letting
myself
in
for
anything
queried
davis
cautiously
you
see
since
that
awful
thing
happened
i
have
turned
over
a
new
leaf
nobody
could
tempt
me
to
go
the
least
bit
on
the
crook
make
your
mind
quite
easy
davis
we
have
nothing
against
you
you
know
that
or
you
would
have
hardly
dared
to
come
to
life
again
well
sir
i
did
know
george
burton
pretty
intimately
at
one
time
after
he
left
paris
he
was
in
the
forgery
business
and
he
tried
to
drag
me
in
but
i
was
clever
enough
to
keep
out
of
it
they
used
in
his
own
set
to
call
him
the
penman
good
said
bryant
and
what
did
you
know
about
the
girl
not
very
much
sir
she
passed
as
his
sister
but
one
or
two
of
his
pals
believed
her
to
be
his
wife
although
there
was
no
evidence
of
it
did
you
ever
learn
anything
of
her
origin
well
one
chap
who
seemed
to
know
more
about
them
than
their
other
pals
told
me
that
she
was
by
way
of
being
a
lady
the
illegitimate
daughter
of
a
man
in
london
society
do
you
know
the
name
of
the
man
davis
tapped
his
forehead
in
the
effort
of
recollection
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
sir
it
will
come
to
me
in
a
moment
a
man
who
was
mixed
up
in
a
gambling
scandal
and
had
to
leave
the
country
ah
i
have
got
it
now
he
was
known
familiarly
as
tommie
esmond
bryant
rose
he
had
got
all
he
could
out
of
his
new
acquaintance
the
threads
in
his
hand
were
drawing
closer
into
a
web
well
davis
many
thanks
for
the
information
you
have
given
me
it
has
been
very
helpful
i
will
keep
in
touch
with
you
and
you
think
with
me
it
was
a
murder
and
not
a
suicide
questioned
davis
as
he
left
but
bryant
was
not
the
man
to
express
a
decided
opinion
until
he
was
fully
justified
by
the
facts
he
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
till
the
last
moment
he
smiled
pleasantly
time
will
show
i
shall
have
that
body
exhumed
as
soon
as
i
have
made
a
few
further
inquiries
davis
had
to
be
content
with
this
oracular
utterance
and
bowed
himself
out
he
solaced
himself
by
narrating
all
that
had
occurred
to
the
wondering
carrie
the
matter
had
now
become
one
for
the
activities
of
scotland
yard
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
ascertain
the
whereabouts
of
hugh
murchison
that
is
to
say
if
he
was
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
some
time
had
elapsed
since
he
had
communicated
with
parkinson
of
course
in
itself
there
would
be
nothing
strange
in
that
parkinson
had
got
the
information
that
was
required
been
paid
for
it
and
with
that
payment
their
relations
had
ended
bryant
went
to
the
hotel
where
the
major
had
stayed
at
any
rate
up
to
the
time
that
the
detective
had
last
seen
him
and
interviewed
the
manager
whom
he
had
known
for
some
years
in
his
professional
capacity
this
person
a
genial
and
cosmopolitan
italian
readily
answered
his
questions
yes
the
major
had
stayed
there
for
some
little
time
when
he
came
he
explained
that
he
was
only
paying
a
flying
visit
to
london
had
he
brought
a
servant
with
him
no
he
had
not
a
somewhat
strange
omission
for
a
man
in
his
position
was
it
not
the
circumstance
was
easily
explained
the
major
had
had
to
dismiss
his
late
valet
for
theft
and
was
not
in
a
hurry
for
the
present
to
suit
himself
with
a
fresh
one
this
he
had
told
the
manager
and
he
was
valeted
at
the
hotel
he
had
left
some
time
how
long
the
manager
would
find
out
the
exact
date
this
he
did
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
of
july
the
major
had
taken
his
things
down
to
victoria
station
in
a
cab
with
the
view
of
depositing
them
there
as
he
was
going
to
take
an
evening
train
to
brighton
bryant
brightened
up
at
this
information
the
discovery
of
the
dead
body
at
cathcart
square
had
taken
place
early
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
now
arose
the
question
had
the
major
got
through
his
business
with
the
spencers
before
the
fourth
of
july
in
that
case
spencer
was
hardly
likely
to
be
still
living
at
eaton
place
with
her
husband
inquiries
at
eaton
place
soon
established
the
fact
that
spencer
was
still
there
what
had
happened
had
the
major
communicated
the
result
of
his
research
to
the
husband
with
the
result
that
infatuated
with
his
wife
that
husband
had
refused
to
credit
the
story
and
accepted
denials
it
was
a
fairly
plausible
theory
when
men
are
deeply
in
love
women
can
twist
them
round
their
little
finger
in
that
case
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
disgusted
with
the
failure
of
his
intervention
the
major
had
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
london
at
once
one
other
thing
was
to
be
done
to
ascertain
if
the
major
had
intimated
to
any
of
his
friends
his
intention
of
leaving
london
so
abruptly
for
this
purpose
bryant
sought
out
the
brother
roderick
who
had
rooms
in
jermyn
street
yes
roderick
had
met
the
major
in
bond
street
in
the
morning
and
learned
of
the
proposed
journey
to
brighton
the
young
man
added
that
his
brother
was
very
erratic
in
his
movements
and
sometimes
would
disappear
for
weeks
at
a
stretch
without
communicating
with
any
of
his
friends
or
relatives
there
was
now
one
of
two
theories
that
stood
out
the
first
one
that
guy
spencer
had
been
told
and
refused
to
believe
the
true
facts
about
his
wife
the
second
was
that
the
major
had
shirked
the
unpleasantness
of
a
personal
interview
of
such
a
delicate
character
and
had
gone
down
to
brighton
intending
to
write
privately
to
spencer
from
there
further
inquiries
elicited
the
fact
that
the
major
had
never
made
that
projected
journey
to
brighton
his
belongings
had
never
been
claimed
they
were
still
lying
in
the
cloak
room
at
victoria
station
there
was
now
no
further
doubt
as
to
what
steps
had
to
be
taken
the
major
had
disappeared
at
a
date
practically
coinciding
with
the
discovery
of
the
dead
body
at
cathcart
square
the
dead
body
which
had
been
wrongly
identified
as
that
of
reginald
davis
whose
likeness
to
the
major
was
so
pronounced
of
that
fact
bryant
himself
was
aware
the
authorities
were
applied
to
and
gave
permission
for
the
body
to
be
exhumed
as
the
living
reginald
davis
had
established
his
identity
to
the
satisfaction
of
scotland
yard
it
was
necessary
to
find
out
if
possible
that
of
the
man
who
had
been
mistaken
for
him
the
body
was
exhumed
and
pronounced
by
people
including
guy
spencer
to
be
that
of
the
major
it
had
now
become
clearly
a
case
of
murder
and
although
those
in
charge
of
the
case
had
little
or
no
doubt
as
to
the
guilty
persons
it
might
have
been
very
difficult
to
prove
but
for
one
convincing
fact
supplied
by
the
murdered
man
himself
but
this
evidence
which
was
overwhelming
the
police
kept
to
themselves
for
some
little
time
for
their
own
good
reasons
chapter
xxiv
luggage
which
had
been
left
at
victoria
station
on
the
fatal
day
was
of
course
seized
by
the
police
they
searched
it
thoroughly
in
the
hope
that
they
would
find
something
useful
to
them
in
the
shape
of
letters
or
memoranda
of
letters
there
were
only
two
brief
ones
from
iris
deane
in
which
she
expressed
her
determination
of
sticking
out
for
her
ten
thousand
pounds
as
we
know
in
the
end
she
gave
way
and
accepted
seven
but
they
did
find
one
priceless
thing
and
that
was
a
diary
bound
in
red
leather
a
small
volume
as
to
the
size
of
the
page
but
very
bulky
it
had
evidently
been
the
dead
man
habit
to
keep
a
fairly
close
record
of
his
doings
for
it
was
numbered
and
contained
entries
from
some
date
in
may
up
to
july
the
day
before
he
left
the
hotel
and
announced
to
the
manager
that
he
intended
to
take
a
late
train
to
brighton
for
the
twentieth
time
since
he
had
discovered
this
important
piece
of
evidence
bryant
sat
in
his
room
at
scotland
yard
reading
and
the
entries
which
he
knew
almost
by
heart
with
the
entries
before
the
visit
to
london
bryant
had
no
concern
they
recorded
trifling
events
which
had
no
reference
to
the
tragedy
at
cathcart
square
there
was
of
course
allusion
to
the
letter
from
roderick
which
had
so
startled
his
family
the
letter
announcing
his
engagement
to
the
chorus
girl
iris
deane
and
his
fixed
resolve
to
make
her
his
wife
there
was
a
note
of
a
family
council
in
which
the
elder
brother
was
deputed
to
approach
the
young
woman
herself
with
the
object
of
buying
her
off
there
were
a
few
records
of
his
first
days
in
london
after
a
long
absence
his
visits
to
his
clubs
his
meeting
with
old
acquaintances
his
first
interview
with
iris
deane
the
difficulty
of
arranging
further
interviews
either
at
his
hotel
or
her
flat
owing
to
the
fear
of
roddie
popping
in
unexpectedly
then
came
the
whimsical
record
of
his
strolling
round
kensington
halting
opposite
the
house
with
the
board
announcing
that
it
was
to
be
let
furnished
his
interview
with
the
accommodating
caretaker
who
in
return
for
a
very
handsome
gave
him
a
duplicate
key
to
enter
the
house
at
any
time
he
liked
he
had
casually
mentioned
to
miles
that
his
name
was
sanderson
the
major
seemed
childishly
pleased
over
what
he
considered
a
very
astute
move
especially
the
giving
of
another
name
here
in
this
quiet
backwater
of
the
world
for
so
it
would
seem
to
a
man
of
his
wealth
and
position
he
could
continue
his
negotiations
with
the
somewhat
obstinate
iris
in
the
portion
of
the
diary
concerned
with
the
grasping
and
frivolous
young
bryant
was
not
greatly
interested
he
had
learned
this
already
from
iris
deane
whom
he
had
interviewed
a
few
times
and
reginald
davis
he
turned
from
the
bulky
little
volume
the
pages
of
which
were
covered
with
the
major
small
rather
methodical
handwriting
to
a
slenderer
book
lying
beside
him
into
this
had
been
copied
all
the
extracts
bearing
on
the
relations
between
the
dead
man
and
spencer
otherwise
stella
keane
otherwise
norah
burton
the
first
entry
recorded
the
at
carlton
house
terrace
when
he
had
been
struck
by
the
remarkable
likeness
of
his
friend
wife
to
the
pretty
adventuress
at
blankfield
who
had
driven
his
old
friend
jack
pomfret
to
his
death
his
endeavours
to
startle
her
by
allusions
to
that
garrison
town
an
important
entry
was
that
of
his
interview
with
his
old
acquaintance
at
the
club
gilbert
fairfax
from
whom
he
had
learned
something
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
flat
in
elsinore
gardens
the
branding
of
tommie
esmond
as
a
the
flight
of
the
fat
little
man
to
the
continent
the
visit
of
stella
keane
to
charing
cross
station
to
bid
the
detected
cheat
farewell
there
was
a
comment
upon
this
fact
whether
she
is
norah
burton
or
not
her
intimacy
with
the
set
her
solicitude
for
tommie
esmond
are
sufficient
to
make
her
unfit
to
be
the
wife
of
a
straight
honest
fellow
like
my
old
friend
guy
spencer
there
followed
further
entries
relating
his
interview
with
bryant
the
confirmation
by
the
detective
that
stella
keane
was
norah
burton
that
george
dutton
the
keeper
of
the
obscure
little
in
the
city
was
the
same
george
burton
who
had
been
arrested
at
on
a
charge
of
forgery
and
who
thanks
to
one
of
the
cleverest
advocates
at
the
criminal
bar
had
got
off
with
a
very
light
sentence
there
was
a
full
record
of
the
long
interview
with
spencer
in
which
she
had
been
finally
confounded
and
forced
to
confession
of
her
acceptance
of
his
terms
of
the
words
she
had
uttered
when
while
rather
regretting
that
things
could
not
go
on
as
they
were
lamenting
the
fact
that
her
accuser
had
ever
been
born
she
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
her
present
environment
and
would
experience
a
certain
measure
of
relief
in
quitting
it
for
a
more
congenial
sphere
on
the
day
he
had
parted
from
her
the
day
on
which
she
had
yielded
to
his
inflexible
determination
that
she
must
remain
under
her
roof
as
short
a
time
as
possible
he
recorded
the
fact
that
up
to
the
present
moment
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
as
to
the
precise
way
in
which
he
was
going
to
bring
about
the
separation
he
wanted
to
choose
the
way
which
would
least
hurt
guy
there
had
flashed
through
his
mind
that
in
addition
to
the
confession
she
was
about
to
make
to
him
of
her
whole
career
she
should
confess
to
her
husband
that
she
was
not
legally
his
wife
being
in
reality
the
wife
of
george
burton
alias
george
dutton
there
followed
here
a
note
i
am
convinced
she
and
this
rascal
were
married
the
sister
and
cousin
dodges
were
always
a
fake
i
must
see
parkinson
to
find
out
if
he
can
ferret
out
anything
on
that
point
but
the
time
is
short
in
a
week
i
must
be
ready
for
action
a
further
entry
showed
that
he
had
called
on
parkinson
with
this
object
only
to
learn
that
the
detective
had
gone
on
an
important
mission
abroad
and
could
undertake
no
further
work
till
his
return
which
would
be
some
ten
days
hence
that
idea
therefore
had
to
be
dismissed
he
must
think
out
some
other
plan
then
came
the
last
and
most
important
entry
of
all
dated
on
the
fourth
of
july
written
no
doubt
a
few
hours
before
he
took
his
luggage
to
victoria
station
i
meet
norah
burton
i
always
think
of
her
by
that
old
name
at
cathcart
square
at
six
i
have
given
the
caretaker
a
holiday
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
i
have
drawn
up
two
copies
of
the
confession
one
of
which
she
is
to
sign
i
have
also
drawn
up
an
undertaking
on
my
part
to
keep
her
from
want
in
case
guy
should
prove
obdurate
but
this
i
am
sure
he
will
not
do
besides
if
she
is
his
wife
and
thinking
it
over
i
have
my
doubts
as
to
whether
she
was
ever
really
married
to
burton
he
would
have
to
support
her
in
spite
of
her
unsavoury
associations
bryant
paused
for
a
moment
as
he
finished
this
paragraph
to
reflect
a
little
personally
he
did
not
believe
that
she
was
the
wife
of
george
burton
in
his
opinion
their
association
had
been
the
result
of
mutual
interests
with
this
knowledge
hanging
over
her
head
she
would
hardly
have
been
daring
enough
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
with
two
other
men
anyway
it
was
a
debatable
point
moreover
burton
like
most
criminals
would
be
very
wide
awake
and
calculating
to
marry
her
would
be
to
handicap
himself
he
could
get
more
out
of
her
by
marrying
her
to
a
rich
man
then
came
the
last
paragraph
of
all
now
for
my
action
after
the
final
interview
of
when
she
has
signed
the
confession
i
may
do
one
of
two
things
forbid
her
to
return
to
her
husband
house
and
go
myself
straight
to
eaton
place
and
break
the
news
to
spencer
without
any
preamble
in
that
case
i
shall
take
with
me
some
ready
money
to
hand
to
her
as
she
will
probably
have
very
little
upon
her
and
yet
i
rather
shrink
from
this
course
it
would
be
painful
for
me
to
watch
his
agony
while
i
struck
such
a
terrible
blow
i
will
run
down
to
brighton
drop
him
a
note
telling
him
that
an
important
letter
will
reach
him
at
his
club
by
registered
post
that
he
is
on
no
account
to
let
his
wife
know
he
has
heard
from
me
till
he
has
read
the
contents
of
that
registered
packet
i
shall
post
him
the
copy
of
the
confession
telling
him
he
can
inspect
the
original
at
any
time
he
likes
meeting
me
either
in
brighton
or
london
leaving
him
to
deal
with
her
as
he
chooses
after
all
his
is
the
right
to
dispose
of
his
private
affairs
my
duty
really
ends
when
i
have
put
him
in
possession
of
the
facts
my
first
method
must
have
the
effect
of
creating
open
scandal
at
once
by
my
insisting
upon
her
not
returning
to
eaton
place
he
may
wish
to
devise
some
plan
that
will
create
a
scandal
less
open
to
save
as
far
as
he
can
the
disgrace
to
himself
and
his
family
if
i
know
the
man
and
here
perhaps
i
am
arguing
from
the
knowledge
only
of
my
own
temperament
i
should
say
his
love
would
turn
to
hatred
after
he
reads
that
confession
jack
pomfret
was
a
weaker
man
than
guy
but
he
acted
as
i
should
have
done
under
the
circumstances
and
refused
all
further
communication
with
her
refused
to
give
her
the
opportunity
of
denial
or
explanation
still
there
is
no
knowing
to
what
lengths
a
infatuation
for
a
fascinating
woman
will
lead
a
man
in
this
respect
guy
may
be
less
adamant
than
pomfret
although
i
am
sure
he
will
never
imitate
poor
jack
final
weakness
he
is
too
sturdily
built
for
that
when
confronted
with
that
confession
she
may
plead
artfully
and
perhaps
to
him
convincingly
that
while
she
admits
everything
contained
in
it
she
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
that
she
tried
to
escape
from
her
odious
bondage
by
marrying
jack
and
that
with
his
suicide
and
the
frustration
of
her
hopes
she
was
compelled
to
return
to
an
environment
which
she
loathed
he
might
consent
to
believe
and
forgive
although
to
me
such
a
thing
seems
incredible
impossible
bryant
closed
the
book
on
the
last
entry
that
little
volume
threw
a
lurid
light
on
the
mystery
of
cathcart
square
the
exhumed
body
was
found
to
be
that
of
major
murchison
wrongly
identified
in
the
first
instance
as
that
of
reginald
davis
it
was
all
very
clear
that
meeting
had
taken
place
and
the
unfortunate
man
had
been
done
to
death
by
the
precious
pair
norah
burton
and
the
scoundrel
brother
cousin
or
lover
whichever
he
was
reginald
davis
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
theirs
had
been
possibly
a
more
intimate
one
than
the
cautious
davis
was
prepared
to
admit
they
took
with
them
letters
addressed
to
their
old
friend
they
forged
a
letter
from
him
intimating
his
intention
to
commit
suicide
if
davis
read
of
all
this
in
the
papers
he
was
too
concerned
with
his
own
danger
to
emerge
from
his
and
publish
the
truth
to
the
world
he
would
be
thankful
that
through
the
villainy
of
others
he
could
take
a
new
lease
of
life
unmenaced
by
detection
of
course
they
had
never
thought
of
the
possibility
that
davis
would
be
cleared
by
the
confession
of
the
real
criminal
like
scotland
yard
they
were
sure
he
was
guilty
and
his
silence
was
a
matter
of
certainty
and
slowly
bryant
drawing
from
the
stores
of
his
vast
experience
began
to
construct
in
his
own
mind
the
details
of
the
murder
executed
by
two
desperate
criminals
almost
driven
to
the
verge
of
madness
by
the
knowledge
that
their
plans
were
about
to
be
frustrated
by
the
action
of
one
man
the
woman
the
weaker
of
the
two
was
probably
more
disposed
to
yield
to
the
force
and
strength
of
circumstances
once
before
in
her
marriage
to
jack
pomfret
she
had
had
the
cup
snatched
from
her
lips
and
bowed
to
the
inevitable
from
the
few
words
recorded
in
the
major
accusing
diary
it
would
seem
that
secured
of
a
modest
competence
she
was
ready
a
second
time
to
accept
her
fate
and
then
in
that
week
interval
it
was
easy
to
guess
what
had
happened
she
had
consulted
her
old
partner
in
crime
george
burton
he
had
reasoned
as
it
turned
out
a
little
shallowly
remove
murchison
and
the
danger
will
be
past
the
resemblance
of
murchison
to
reginald
davis
had
occurred
to
the
pair
hence
the
cunningly
prepared
letters
and
how
was
the
actual
murder
accomplished
had
they
gone
to
cathcart
square
together
or
had
burton
followed
her
getting
in
by
means
of
that
broken
at
the
back
and
did
they
know
the
major
was
alone
in
that
last
interview
with
spencer
had
he
let
out
the
fact
that
he
had
given
the
caretaker
a
holiday
so
that
they
should
not
be
disturbed
these
were
side
problems
that
could
not
be
solved
at
the
moment
only
two
persons
could
solve
them
and
those
two
in
all
probability
would
never
speak
but
how
had
they
killed
him
the
major
was
a
strong
muscular
fellow
who
would
fight
tenaciously
for
his
life
norah
burton
was
a
slender
woman
almost
verging
on
frailness
george
dutton
to
call
him
by
his
latest
name
was
certainly
of
a
muscular
build
although
of
only
average
height
well
of
course
they
had
foreseen
and
prepared
for
all
that
while
talking
to
him
she
had
sprayed
over
him
the
essence
of
some
overpowering
and
stupefying
drug
and
while
he
was
staggering
about
dazed
and
blinded
the
man
had
stepped
in
and
done
the
rest
owing
to
the
absence
of
the
caretaker
they
had
plenty
of
time
they
had
rifled
his
pockets
taking
out
of
them
the
money
which
according
to
his
diary
he
had
brought
along
with
him
his
personal
belongings
the
ticket
which
he
had
received
at
the
luggage
room
of
victoria
station
and
of
course
the
confession
which
norah
burton
had
or
had
not
signed
no
doubt
they
had
also
examined
his
linen
and
underclothing
to
make
sure
that
his
name
was
not
on
them
if
it
had
been
they
would
have
dealt
with
it
by
stripping
the
body
they
had
carried
it
out
pretty
well
on
the
whole
there
were
two
things
they
had
not
reckoned
on
one
was
the
resuscitation
of
reginald
davis
the
other
was
the
fact
that
murchison
kept
a
diary
one
of
the
last
things
that
a
man
of
his
sort
was
likely
to
do
bryant
although
not
a
very
emotional
man
felt
very
depressed
as
he
came
to
the
result
of
his
meditations
he
felt
sure
that
if
norah
burton
could
have
had
her
own
way
she
would
have
accepted
her
fate
gone
forth
on
the
world
again
with
the
slender
pittance
that
either
of
the
two
men
her
husband
or
his
friend
would
have
allowed
her
she
had
suffered
herself
to
be
dominated
by
a
more
reckless
and
criminal
spirit
with
the
result
that
the
life
of
an
honourable
man
had
been
taken
and
she
was
already
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
the
pair
only
knowing
that
the
body
had
been
exhumed
and
proved
to
be
that
of
hugh
murchison
a
terribly
disturbing
thought
to
them
but
ignorant
of
the
discovery
of
that
incriminating
diary
were
being
closely
watched
but
they
felt
sure
that
nothing
could
be
traced
to
them
they
had
hidden
their
tracks
so
cleverly
as
they
thought
it
was
now
only
a
question
of
a
few
hours
as
to
when
they
should
be
taken
and
bryant
felt
that
guy
spencer
should
know
the
truth
before
anybody
else
poor
fellow
he
would
soften
the
blow
to
him
as
much
as
he
could
that
same
evening
he
went
round
to
eaton
place
about
seven
he
reckoned
that
he
would
catch
spencer
before
he
went
up
to
dress
for
dinner
poor
devil
thought
bryant
he
wo
have
much
appetite
for
dinner
after
he
has
read
through
that
diary
spencer
was
in
the
library
and
the
detective
whom
he
had
met
before
in
connection
with
the
mystery
of
cathcart
square
was
shown
in
spencer
welcomed
him
with
his
usual
cordiality
bryant
any
fresh
light
upon
this
terrible
thing
the
footman
had
left
the
library
door
slightly
open
after
showing
bryant
in
and
had
retired
swiftly
to
his
quarters
he
was
hardly
out
of
the
hall
when
stella
opened
the
with
her
key
and
glided
noiselessly
in
all
her
movements
were
noiseless
suggesting
as
somebody
had
once
remarked
of
her
the
silent
motions
of
a
snake
she
always
carried
a
key
declaring
that
she
could
not
be
kept
waiting
for
servants
to
answer
the
door
the
library
door
was
open
through
the
aperture
she
heard
voices
and
one
of
them
she
recognised
it
was
that
of
the
scotland
yard
detective
who
had
her
very
closely
as
to
her
various
meetings
with
the
dead
man
she
had
been
afraid
of
bryant
he
had
looked
at
her
so
searchingly
and
his
manner
always
conveyed
that
he
knew
so
much
more
than
he
was
prepared
to
disclose
bryant
was
speaking
in
a
low
but
very
clear
voice
her
hearing
was
singularly
acute
and
she
could
catch
every
word
i
am
come
on
a
very
painful
errand
spencer
there
is
a
small
volume
here
which
throws
a
very
clear
light
on
what
happened
at
cathcart
square
on
that
fatal
evening
of
july
the
fourth
guy
cheerful
accents
rang
out
you
mean
you
have
got
a
clue
bryant
but
why
painful
to
me
if
you
are
on
the
track
of
the
murderer
of
my
poor
old
friend
nobody
will
be
more
rejoiced
than
i
again
the
low
grave
tones
of
bryant
spencer
you
will
be
a
very
stricken
man
when
you
have
read
through
it
your
poor
friend
left
behind
him
a
very
copious
diary
made
up
to
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
he
was
murdered
the
original
is
at
my
office
you
can
inspect
it
at
any
time
you
like
this
is
a
copy
of
the
entries
relating
to
cathcart
square
it
touches
your
domestic
life
very
closely
in
addition
to
proving
why
and
by
whom
he
was
murdered
stella
waited
to
hear
no
more
her
face
had
gone
livid
she
felt
shaking
in
every
limb
that
her
old
enemy
murchison
had
left
a
diary
they
had
never
thought
of
that
possibility
the
game
was
up
she
had
staked
something
on
her
marriage
as
norah
burton
with
jack
pomfret
and
had
lost
this
time
she
had
staked
everything
and
lost
again
but
now
she
had
lost
liberty
and
life
in
addition
there
was
but
one
end
she
must
seek
at
once
the
man
who
had
in
a
way
been
a
good
and
faithful
friend
but
also
her
evil
genius
she
stole
as
quietly
out
of
the
hall
as
she
had
entered
it
and
hailed
a
passing
taxi
she
knew
she
would
never
enter
the
house
at
eaton
place
again
chapter
xxv
spencer
had
plenty
of
money
in
her
pocket
she
was
always
accustomed
to
carry
a
large
sum
about
her
her
adventurous
life
had
taught
her
that
it
was
always
wiser
to
have
a
good
amount
of
cash
in
her
possession
the
time
might
come
at
any
moment
when
you
were
in
a
tight
corner
she
had
promised
a
handsome
reward
to
the
driver
if
he
could
get
to
a
certain
destination
within
the
speed
limit
that
destination
was
kew
bridge
where
it
abuts
on
a
neighbourhood
called
at
the
foot
of
kew
bridge
the
wretched
and
hunted
woman
halted
and
paid
the
driver
his
extravagant
fare
what
did
it
matter
what
she
paid
she
might
not
be
able
to
pay
she
shuddered
as
she
thought
of
that
the
drove
slowly
out
of
sight
she
waited
from
a
sense
of
habitual
caution
till
he
was
well
out
of
the
way
and
then
remembering
everything
she
smiled
bitterly
was
there
any
need
of
caution
now
she
went
down
a
narrow
lane
halted
at
the
door
of
a
small
cottage
and
rang
the
bell
as
she
did
so
she
was
aware
of
a
man
a
few
yards
away
from
her
who
seemed
to
be
strolling
aimlessly
about
a
man
dressed
in
clothes
and
heavy
boots
a
detective
certainly
this
man
had
followed
her
from
eaton
place
in
a
taxi
almost
as
swift
as
her
own
bryant
knew
his
business
he
was
not
going
to
lose
sight
of
her
or
of
her
reputed
cousin
george
dutton
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
by
george
dutton
alias
george
burton
it
was
a
small
furnished
cottage
that
he
had
rented
for
some
months
past
at
a
rent
commensurate
with
his
means
he
kept
no
servant
a
feeble
old
woman
came
in
the
morning
to
clean
him
up
and
prepare
his
breakfast
when
he
came
back
at
night
from
the
not
very
prosperous
he
looked
after
himself
and
cooked
over
a
his
evening
meal
the
evenings
were
drawing
in
and
it
was
rather
a
dark
night
he
peered
for
a
moment
at
his
visitor
before
he
recognised
her
stella
by
all
that
is
wonderful
he
called
her
by
the
new
name
not
the
old
one
of
norah
come
in
dear
but
your
arrival
in
this
unexpected
fashion
does
not
suggest
good
news
she
passed
hastily
through
the
open
doorway
shut
it
quick
she
said
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
there
is
a
man
watching
outside
i
am
sure
he
is
a
detective
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
two
detectives
within
a
few
feet
of
each
other
but
in
her
agitation
she
had
not
observed
the
second
man
who
was
deputed
to
keep
watch
on
the
movements
of
george
dutton
george
dutton
was
an
old
hand
and
not
to
be
lightly
disturbed
by
small
incidents
but
he
recognised
the
significance
of
this
visit
his
ruddy
colour
died
away
you
have
bad
news
he
said
quietly
the
worst
george
bryant
the
detective
paid
a
visit
to
guy
this
evening
i
came
in
just
in
the
nick
of
time
the
library
door
was
ajar
i
heard
what
bryant
said
the
major
has
left
a
diary
behind
him
and
of
course
he
had
put
it
all
down
up
to
the
arranged
meeting
in
cathcart
square
the
game
is
up
you
will
recognise
that
dutton
mentality
was
a
little
bit
slower
than
her
own
did
you
hear
any
extracts
read
from
the
diary
what
a
fool
you
are
she
cried
indignantly
why
should
i
wait
to
hear
if
the
man
kept
a
diary
is
it
not
easy
to
guess
that
he
would
have
related
every
incident
connected
with
me
from
our
first
meeting
at
the
southleigh
bryant
is
watching
me
there
is
a
detective
waiting
outside
no
doubt
he
is
watching
you
too
he
is
just
waiting
to
pounce
then
why
has
he
gone
to
your
husband
oh
you
are
too
dense
for
worlds
just
to
soften
the
blow
ca
you
understand
that
he
wants
to
warn
him
beforehand
of
the
shame
that
is
going
to
fall
upon
him
the
discovery
that
his
wife
is
a
murderess
and
then
dutton
understood
he
stretched
out
appealing
arms
to
her
my
poor
little
girl
my
ever
faithful
pal
and
i
have
brought
you
to
this
you
have
brought
me
to
this
she
said
bitterly
did
i
not
implore
you
upon
my
knees
to
accept
the
major
terms
and
you
were
so
obstinate
so
set
you
would
insist
upon
the
other
way
because
it
seemed
better
to
you
and
i
fool
that
i
was
always
yielding
to
your
sinister
influence
gave
way
as
i
always
have
done
scoundrel
and
criminal
as
he
was
hardened
by
years
of
the
man
gave
way
at
that
accusation
he
drew
her
to
him
and
strange
to
say
she
did
not
shrink
from
his
my
poor
stella
i
have
tried
to
do
my
best
for
you
always
even
sacrificed
myself
but
the
end
has
come
he
recognised
that
as
she
did
yes
she
said
stoically
as
you
say
the
end
has
come
you
have
always
been
very
adept
in
falling
into
holes
and
then
digging
yourself
out
again
how
are
you
going
to
dig
yourself
and
me
out
of
this
hole
in
the
face
of
that
incriminating
diary
dutton
walked
up
and
down
his
face
working
his
hands
and
his
body
trembling
he
was
up
against
the
gravest
problem
of
his
adventurous
career
the
shadow
of
the
prison
had
always
hovered
over
him
but
now
there
was
a
more
ghastly
menace
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
from
the
prison
he
could
return
there
was
no
return
from
the
other
he
paused
in
his
restless
pacing
and
came
to
a
halt
before
the
stricken
woman
he
had
recovered
himself
to
a
certain
extent
he
had
gambled
and
lost
he
was
prepared
to
accept
the
fate
of
the
unsuccessful
gambler
you
are
brave
old
girl
he
asked
briefly
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
wan
smile
yes
i
think
i
am
brave
i
can
guess
what
you
are
about
to
suggest
with
the
detectives
watching
us
outside
she
burst
into
a
little
sob
oh
you
always
thought
you
were
so
clever
and
yet
if
i
had
had
the
management
of
affairs
things
might
have
been
so
different
he
spoke
humbly
i
think
you
are
right
norah
i
was
always
full
of
arrogance
and
you
were
weaker
in
character
than
i
was
but
you
had
always
more
brains
and
i
was
a
blind
fool
not
to
admit
it
many
a
time
you
gave
me
your
advice
and
i
rejected
it
and
what
do
you
suggest
now
she
asked
in
a
voice
that
had
sunk
to
a
whisper
he
looked
at
her
steadily
he
had
screwed
up
his
courage
to
the
sticking
point
could
he
count
upon
an
equal
fortitude
in
her
it
is
the
finish
old
girl
you
say
the
detectives
are
waiting
outside
bryant
has
got
a
good
case
and
the
diary
will
hang
us
there
is
no
getting
over
that
you
propose
she
said
falteringly
he
spoke
quite
steadily
the
end
had
come
he
had
made
up
his
mind
so
far
as
regards
himself
we
neither
of
us
want
to
hang
for
the
murder
of
hugh
murchison
she
shuddered
and
hid
her
face
with
her
hands
oh
that
awful
evening
it
has
been
like
a
nightmare
ever
since
i
know
said
dutton
soothingly
it
was
one
of
my
fatal
mistakes
but
it
is
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
we
are
face
to
face
with
facts
we
have
gambled
and
we
have
lost
and
we
have
got
to
pay
the
penalty
the
wretched
woman
rose
up
and
wrung
her
hands
and
to
think
i
might
have
been
the
countess
of
southleigh
i
know
do
think
i
am
not
reckoning
up
all
that
replied
dutton
but
we
have
got
to
deal
with
facts
with
the
detectives
waiting
outside
the
game
is
up
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
we
have
only
a
few
hours
before
us
perhaps
a
few
minutes
in
which
to
make
the
choice
i
know
she
answered
you
mean
our
only
alternative
is
to
cheat
the
law
he
looked
at
her
steadily
that
is
the
only
way
if
we
suffer
ourselves
to
be
taken
we
have
not
got
a
dog
chance
weak
woman
as
she
was
she
gathered
something
of
his
iron
resolution
yes
they
must
die
and
die
together
to
cheat
the
law
such
was
to
be
the
end
of
the
brilliant
adventuress
who
had
inveigled
two
men
into
marriage
jack
pomfret
and
guy
spencer
with
her
subtle
and
elusive
charm
and
what
do
you
suggest
george
you
have
thought
of
these
things
more
than
i
have
i
have
always
thought
of
them
said
dutton
gloomily
well
there
are
various
ways
i
can
suggest
to
you
i
can
shoot
you
first
and
myself
afterwards
she
shuddered
some
other
way
than
that
i
can
give
you
some
tabloids
is
there
any
pain
she
queried
hardly
any
she
shuddered
again
hardly
any
that
does
not
sound
very
convincing
he
proposed
a
third
alternative
you
can
come
up
to
my
room
and
lie
on
the
bed
i
will
paper
up
all
the
doors
and
cracks
and
turn
up
the
gas
you
will
simply
go
to
sleep
and
never
wake
that
is
the
best
she
said
if
we
had
plenty
of
time
but
they
may
take
us
in
a
few
minutes
bryant
has
seen
your
husband
he
will
not
wait
long
after
that
interview
the
tabloids
then
she
said
firmly
yes
it
had
come
to
this
she
must
cheat
the
law
twice
she
had
had
her
chance
once
as
the
wife
of
jack
pomfret
again
as
the
wife
of
guy
spencer
and
twice
had
the
cup
of
triumph
been
snatched
from
her
lips
she
must
die
like
a
rat
in
a
hole
in
this
obscure
little
cottage
at
in
the
company
of
the
man
who
had
always
been
her
evil
genius
dutton
went
across
to
a
small
cupboard
built
in
the
wall
of
the
shabby
parlour
and
brought
out
a
little
bottle
filled
with
capsules
he
extracted
one
and
handed
it
to
the
shrinking
woman
take
yours
first
dear
i
will
take
mine
after
there
was
a
look
of
infinite
compassion
in
the
scoundrel
face
as
he
offered
it
to
her
bravely
she
took
it
and
swallowed
it
with
a
great
gulp
sitting
in
the
shabby
the
effect
was
almost
instantaneous
and
when
dutton
had
made
sure
that
she
was
beyond
human
aid
he
took
a
similar
tabloid
himself
with
the
same
result
an
hour
later
there
was
a
thundering
knock
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
one
of
the
detectives
had
gone
to
a
telephone
office
and
informed
bryant
that
the
woman
had
come
to
and
was
with
dutton
the
order
came
back
from
bryant
who
had
only
stayed
a
few
minutes
at
eaton
place
that
the
pair
were
to
be
arrested
at
once
of
course
there
was
no
response
after
waiting
for
a
few
moments
the
men
broke
in
the
frail
door
but
they
were
too
late
norah
burton
and
the
man
who
had
been
so
long
associated
with
her
brother
cousin
lover
whatever
he
might
be
had
gone
to
their
judgment
it
was
a
wonder
and
while
his
friends
and
acquaintances
were
still
discussing
it
at
clubs
and
over
guy
spencer
slipped
quietly
abroad
when
he
returned
to
england
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
these
tragic
happenings
had
become
little
more
than
a
memory
to
his
world
he
stayed
a
week
with
the
southleighs
at
their
ancestral
home
in
sussex
and
at
the
end
of
that
week
their
friends
read
an
important
announcement
in
morning
a
marriage
has
been
arranged
and
will
shortly
take
place
between
mr
guy
spencer
and
his
cousin
lady
nina
only
daughter
and
child
of
the
earl
of
southleigh
the
end
