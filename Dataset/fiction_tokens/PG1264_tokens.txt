i
the
principal
character
in
the
story
if
you
presuming
you
are
of
the
sex
that
does
such
things
if
you
had
gone
into
the
drapery

which
is
really
only

a
perfectly
fictitious
by
the
bye
of
putney
on
the
of
august
had
turned
to
the
side
where
the
blocks
of
white
linen
and
piles
of
blankets
rise
up
to
the
rail
from
which
the
pink
and
blue
prints
depend
you
might
have
been
served
by
the
central
figure
of
this
story
that
is
now
beginning
he
would
have
come
forward
bowing
and
swaying
he
would
have
extended
two
hands
with
largish
knuckles
and
enormous
cuffs
over
the
counter
and
he
would
have
asked
you
protruding
a
pointed
chin
and
without
the
slightest
anticipation
of
pleasure
in
his
manner
what
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
under
certain
circumstances
as
for
instance
hats
baby
linen
gloves
silks
lace
or
curtains
he
would
simply
have
bowed
politely
and
with
a
drooping
expression
and
making
a
kind
of
circular
sweep
invited
you
to
this
way
and
so
led
you
beyond
his
ken
but
under
other
and
happier
conditions
huckaback
blankets
dimity
cretonne
linen
calico
are
cases
in
point
he
would
have
requested
you
to
take
a
seat
emphasising
the
hospitality
by
leaning
over
the
counter
and
gripping
a
chair
back
in
a
spasmodic
manner
and
so
proceeded
to
obtain
unfold
and
exhibit
his
goods
for
your
consideration
under
which
happier
circumstances
you
might
if
of
an
observing
turn
of
mind
and
not
too
much
of
a
housewife
to
be
inhuman
have
given
the
central
figure
of
this
story
less
cursory
attention
now
if
you
had
noticed
anything
about
him
it
would
have
been
chiefly
to
notice
how
little
he
was
noticeable
he
wore
the
black
morning
coat
the
black
tie
and
the
speckled
grey
nether
parts
descending
into
shadow
and
mystery
below
the
counter
of
his
craft
he
was
of
a
pallid
complexion
hair
of
a
kind
of
dirty
fairness
greyish
eyes
and
a
skimpy
immature
moustache
under
his
peaked
indeterminate
nose
his
features
were
all
small
but
none
a
rosette
of
pins
decorated
the
lappel
of
his
coat
his
remarks
you
would
observe
were
entirely
what
people
used
to
call
cliche
formulae
not
organic
to
the
occasion
but
stereotyped
ages
ago
and
learnt
years
since
by
heart
madam
he
would
say
selling
very
are
doing
a
very
good
article
at
four
three
a
could
show
you
something
better
of
trouble
madam
i
assure
such
were
the
simple
counters
of
his
intercourse
so
i
say
he
would
have
presented
himself
to
your
superficial
observation
he
would
have
danced
about
behind
the
counter
have
neatly
refolded
the
goods
he
had
shown
you
have
put
on
one
side
those
you
selected
extracted
a
little
book
with
a
carbon
leaf
and
a
tinfoil
sheet
from
a
fixture
made
you
out
a
little
bill
in
that
weak
flourishing
hand
peculiar
to
drapers
and
have
bawled
then
a
puffy
little
would
have
come
into
view
looked
at
the
bill
for
a
second
very
hard
showing
you
a
parting
down
the
middle
of
his
head
meanwhile
have
scribbled
a
still
more
flourishing
all
over
the
document
have
asked
you
if
there
was
nothing
more
have
stood
by
you
supposing
that
you
were
paying
cash
until
the
central
figure
of
this
story
reappeared
with
the
change
one
glance
more
at
him
and
the
puffy
little
would
have
been
bowing
you
out
with
fountains
of
civilities
at
work
all
about
you
and
so
the
interview
would
have
terminated
but
real
literature
as
distinguished
from
anecdote
does
not
concern
itself
with
superficial
appearances
alone
literature
is
revelation
modern
literature
is
indecorous
revelation
it
is
the
duty
of
the
earnest
author
to
tell
you
what
you
would
not
have
seen
even
at
the
cost
of
some
blushes
and
the
thing
that
you
would
not
have
seen
about
this
young
man
and
the
thing
of
the
greatest
moment
to
this
story
the
thing
that
must
be
told
if
the
book
is
to
be
written
was
let
us
face
it
bravely
the
remarkable
condition
of
this
young
legs
let
us
approach
the
business
with
dispassionate
explicitness
let
us
assume
something
of
the
scientific
spirit
the
hard
almost
professorial
tone
of
the
conscientious
realist
let
us
treat
this
young
legs
as
a
mere
diagram
and
indicate
the
points
of
interest
with
the
unemotional
precision
of
a
pointer
and
so
to
our
revelation
on
the
internal
aspect
of
the
right
ankle
of
this
young
man
you
would
have
observed
ladies
and
gentlemen
a
contusion
and
an
abrasion
on
the
internal
aspect
of
the
left
ankle
a
contusion
also
on
its
external
aspect
a
large
yellowish
bruise
on
his
left
shin
there
were
two
bruises
one
a
leaden
yellow
graduating
here
and
there
into
purple
and
another
obviously
of
more
recent
date
of
a
blotchy
red
tumid
and
threatening
proceeding
up
the
left
leg
in
a
spiral
manner
an
unnatural
hardness
and
redness
would
have
been
discovered
on
the
upper
aspect
of
the
calf
and
above
the
knee
and
on
the
inner
side
an
extraordinary
expanse
of
bruised
surface
a
kind
of
closely
stippled
shading
of
contused
points
the
right
leg
would
be
found
to
be
bruised
in
a
marvellous
manner
all
about
and
under
the
knee
and
particularly
on
the
interior
aspect
of
the
knee
so
far
we
may
proceed
with
our
details
fired
by
these
discoveries
an
investigator
might
perhaps
have
pursued
his
inquiries
further
to
bruises
on
the
shoulders
elbows
and
even
the
finger
joints
of
the
central
figure
of
our
story
he
had
indeed
been
bumped
and
battered
at
an
extraordinary
number
of
points
but
enough
of
realistic
description
is
as
good
as
a
feast
and
we
have
exhibited
enough
for
our
purpose
even
in
literature
one
must
know
where
to
draw
the
line
now
the
reader
may
be
inclined
to
wonder
how
a
respectable
young
shopman
should
have
got
his
legs
and
indeed
himself
generally
into
such
a
dreadful
condition
one
might
fancy
that
he
had
been
sitting
with
his
nether
extremities
in
some
complicated
machinery
a
say
or
one
of
those
furies
but
sherlock
holmes
now
happily
dead
would
have
fancied
nothing
of
the
kind
he
would
have
recognised
at
once
that
the
bruises
on
the
internal
aspect
of
the
left
leg
considered
in
the
light
of
the
distribution
of
the
other
abrasions
and
contusions
pointed
unmistakably
to
the
violent
impact
of
the
mounting
beginner
upon
the
bicycling
saddle
and
that
the
ruinous
state
of
the
right
knee
was
equally
eloquent
of
the
concussions
attendant
on
that
hasty
frequently
causeless
and
invariably
descents
one
large
bruise
on
the
shin
is
even
more
characteristic
of
the
cyclist
for
upon
every
one
of
them
waits
the
jest
of
the
unexpected
treadle
you
try
at
least
to
walk
your
machine
in
an
easy
manner
and
whack
you
are
rubbing
your
shin
so
out
of
innocence
we
ripen
two
bruises
on
that
place
mark
a
certain
want
of
aptitude
in
learning
such
as
one
might
expect
in
a
person
unused
to
muscular
exercise
blisters
on
the
hands
are
eloquent
of
the
nervous
clutch
of
the
wavering
rider
and
so
forth
until
sherlock
is
presently
explaining
by
the
help
of
the
minor
injuries
that
the
machine
ridden
is
an
affair
with
a
fork
instead
of
the
diamond
frame
a
cushioned
tire
well
worn
on
the
hind
wheel
and
a
gross
weight
all
on
of
perhaps
pounds
the
revelation
is
made
behind
the
decorous
figure
of
the
attentive
shopman
that
i
had
the
honour
of
showing
you
at
first
rises
a
vision
of
a
nightly
struggle
of
two
dark
figures
and
a
machine
in
a
dark
road
the
road
to
be
explicit
from
roehampton
to
putney
hill
and
with
this
vision
is
the
sound
of
a
heel
spurning
the
gravel
a
gasping
and
grunting
a
shouting
of
man
steer
a
wavering
unsteady
flight
a
spasmodic
turning
of
the
missile
edifice
of
man
and
machine
and
a
collapse
then
you
descry
dimly
through
the
dusk
the
central
figure
of
this
story
sitting
by
the
roadside
and
rubbing
his
leg
at
some
new
place
and
his
friend
sympathetic
but
by
no
means
depressed
repairing
the
displacement
of
the
thus
even
in
a
shop
assistant
does
the
warmth
of
manhood
assert
itself
and
drive
him
against
all
the
conditions
of
his
calling
against
the
counsels
of
prudence
and
the
restrictions
of
his
means
to
seek
the
wholesome
delights
of
exertion
and
danger
and
pain
and
our
first
examination
of
the
draper
reveals
beneath
his
draperies
the
man
to
which
initial
fact
among
others
we
shall
come
again
in
the
end
ii
but
enough
of
these
revelations
the
central
figure
of
our
story
is
now
going
along
behind
the
counter
a
draper
indeed
with
your
purchases
in
his
arms
to
the
warehouse
where
the
various
articles
you
have
selected
will
presently
be
packed
by
the
senior
porter
and
sent
to
you
returning
thence
to
his
particular
place
he
lays
hands
on
a
folded
piece
of
gingham
and
gripping
the
corners
of
the
folds
in
his
hands
begins
to
straighten
them
punctiliously
near
him
is
an
apprentice
apprenticed
to
the
same
high
calling
of
assistant
a
ruddy
lad
in
a
very
short
tailless
black
coat
and
a
very
high
collar
who
is
deliberately
unfolding
and
refolding
some
patterns
of
cretonne
by
he
too
may
hope
to
be
a
assistant
even
as
hoopdriver
prints
depend
from
the
brass
rails
above
them
behind
are
fixtures
full
of
white
packages
containing
as
inscriptions
testify
lino
hd
bk
and
mull
you
might
imagine
to
see
them
that
the
two
were
both
intent
upon
nothing
but
smoothness
of
textile
and
rectitude
of
fold
but
to
tell
the
truth
neither
is
thinking
of
the
mechanical
duties
in
hand
the
assistant
is
dreaming
of
the
delicious
time
only
four
hours
off
now
when
he
will
resume
the
tale
of
his
bruises
and
abrasions
the
apprentice
is
nearer
the
long
long
thoughts
of
boyhood
and
his
imagination
rides
through
the
chambers
of
his
brain
seeking
some
knightly
quest
in
honour
of
that
fair
lady
the
last
but
one
of
the
girl
apprentices
to
the
upstairs
he
inclines
rather
to
street
fighting
against
revolutionaries
because
then
she
could
see
him
from
the
window
jerking
them
back
to
the
present
comes
the
puffy
little
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
the
apprentice
becomes
extremely
active
the
shopwalker

the
goods
in
hand

says
that
line
of
ginghams
hoopdriver
returns
from
an
imaginary
triumph
over
the
uncertainties
of
dismounting
going
fairly
well
sir
but
the
larger
checks
seem
the
brings
up
parallel
to
the
counter
particular
time
when
you
want
your
holidays
he
asks
hoopdriver
pulls
at
his
skimpy
moustache
want
them
too
late
sir
of
about
this
day
week
hoopdriver
becomes
rigidly
meditative
gripping
the
corners
of
the
gingham
folds
in
his
hands
his
face
is
eloquent
of
conflicting
considerations
can
he
learn
it
in
a
week
the
question
otherwise
briggs
will
get
next
week
and
he
will
have
to
wait
until
september
when
the
weather
is
often
uncertain
he
is
naturally
of
a
sanguine
disposition
all
drapers
have
to
be
or
else
they
could
never
have
the
faith
they
show
in
the
beauty
washability
and
unfading
excellence
of
the
goods
they
sell
you
the
decision
comes
at
last
do
me
very
well
said
hoopdriver
terminating
the
pause
the
die
is
cast
the
makes
a
note
of
it
and
goes
on
to
briggs
in
the
the
next
in
the
strict
scale
of
precedence
of
the
drapery
emporium
hoopdriver
in
alternating
spasms
anon
straightens
his
gingham
and
anon
becomes
meditative
with
his
tongue

hollow
of

iii
at
supper
that
night
holiday
talk
held
undisputed
sway
pritchard
spoke
of
miss
isaacs
clamoured
of
judson
displayed
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
norfolk
broads
said
hoopdriver
when
the
question
came
to
him
cycling
of
never
going
to
ride
that
dreadful
machine
of
yours
day
after
day
said
miss
howe
of
the
costume
department
am
said
hoopdriver
as
calmly
as
possible
pulling
at
the
insufficient
moustache
going
for
a
cycling
tour
along
the
south
all
i
hope
hoopdriver
is
that
get
fine
weather
said
miss
howe
not
come
any
nasty
done
forget
some
tinscher
of
arnica
in
yer
bag
said
the
junior
apprentice
in
the
very
high
collar
he
had
witnessed
one
of
the
lessons
at
the
top
of
putney
hill
stow
it
said
hoopdriver
looking
hard
and
threateningly
at
the
junior
apprentice
and
suddenly
adding
in
a
tone
of
bitter
contempt
getting
fairly
safe
upon
it
now
he
told
miss
howe
at
other
times
hoopdriver
might
have
further
resented
the
satirical
efforts
of
the
apprentice
but
his
mind
was
too
full
of
the
projected
tour
to
admit
any
petty
delicacies
of
dignity
he
left
the
supper
table
early
so
that
he
might
put
in
a
good
hour
at
the
desperate
gymnastics
up
the
roehampton
road
before
it
would
be
time
to
come
back
for
locking
up
when
the
gas
was
turned
off
for
the
night
he
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
rubbing
arnica
into
his
knee
a
new
and
very
big
place
and
studying
a
road
map
of
the
south
of
england
briggs
of
the
who
shared
the
room
with
him
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
trying
to
smoke
in
the
dark
briggs
had
never
been
on
a
cycle
in
his
life
but
he
felt
inexperience
and
offered
such
advice
as
occurred
to
him
the
machine
thoroughly
well
oiled
said
briggs
one
or
two
lemons
with
you
tear
yourself
to
death
the
first
day
and
sit
upright
never
lose
control
of
the
machine
and
always
sound
the
bell
on
every
possible
opportunity
you
mind
those
things
and
nothing
very
much
happen
to
you
hoopdriver
you
take
my
he
would
lapse
into
silence
for
a
minute
save
perhaps
for
a
curse
or
so
at
his
pipe
and
then
break
out
with
an
entirely
different
set
of
tips
running
over
dogs
hoopdriver
whatever
you
do
one
of
the
worst
things
you
can
do
to
run
over
a
dog
never
let
the
machine
buckle
there
was
a
man
killed
only
the
other
day
through
his
wheel
buckling
scorch
ride
on
the
keep
your
own
side
of
the
road
and
if
you
see
a
tramline
go
round
the
corner
at
once
and
hurry
off
into
the
next
county
and
always
light
up
before
dark
you
mind
just
a
few
little
things
like
that
hoopdriver
and
nothing
much
happen
to
you
you
take
my
you
are
said
hoopdriver
old
said
briggs
and
there
was
silence
for
a
space
save
for
the
succulent
respiration
of
the
pipe
hoopdriver
rode
off
into
dreamland
on
his
machine
and
was
scarcely
there
before
he
was
pitched
back
into
the
world
of
sense
something
what
was
it
oil
the
steering
fatal
a
voice
that
came
from
round
a
fitful
glow
of
light
was
saying
clean
the
chain
daily
with
you
mind
just
a
few
little
things
like
that
love
us
said
hoopdriver
and
pulled
the
bedclothes
over
his
ears
iv
the
riding
forth
of
hoopdriver
only
those
who
toil
six
long
days
out
of
the
seven
and
all
the
year
round
save
for
one
brief
glorious
fortnight
or
ten
days
in
the
summer
time

the
exquisite
sensations
of
the
first
holiday
morning
all
the
dreary
uninteresting
routine
drops
from
you
suddenly
your
chains
fall
about
your
feet
all
at
once
you
are
lord
of
yourself
lord
of
every
hour
in
the
long
vacant
day
you
may
go
where
you
please
call
none
sir
or
madame
have
a
lappel
free
of
pins
doff
your
black
morning
coat
and
wear
the
colour
of
your
heart
and
be
a
man
you
grudge
sleep
you
grudge
eating
and
drinking
even
their
intrusion
on
those
exquisite
moments
there
will
be
no
more
rising
before
breakfast
in
casual
old
clothing
to
go
dusting
and
getting
ready
in
a
cheerless
shop
no
more
imperious
cries
of
hoopdriver
no
more
hasty
meals
and
weary
attendance
on
fitful
old
women
for
ten
blessed
days
the
first
morning
is
by
far
the
most
glorious
for
you
hold
your
whole
fortune
in
your
hands
thereafter
every
night
comes
a
pang
a
spectre
that
will
not
be
exorcised
the
premonition
of
the
return
the
shadow
of
going
back
of
being
put
in
the
cage
again
for
another
twelve
months
lies
blacker
and
blacker
across
the
sunlight
but
on
the
first
morning
of
the
ten
the
holiday
has
no
past
and
ten
days
seems
as
good
as
infinity
and
it
was
fine
full
of
a
promise
of
glorious
days
a
deep
blue
sky
with
dazzling
piles
of
white
cloud
here
and
there
as
though
celestial
haymakers
had
been
piling
the
swathes
of
last
clouds
into
cocks
for
a
coming
cartage
there
were
thrushes
in
the
richmond
road
and
a
lark
on
putney
heath
the
freshness
of
dew
was
in
the
air
dew
or
the
relics
of
an
overnight
shower
glittered
on
the
leaves
and
grass
hoopdriver
had
breakfasted
early
by
complaisance
he
wheeled
his
machine
up
putney
hill
and
his
heart
sang
within
him
halfway
up
a
black
cat
rushed
home
across
the
road
and
vanished
under
a
gate
all
the
big
houses
behind
the
variegated
shrubs
and
trees
had
their
blinds
down
still
and
he
would
not
have
changed
places
with
a
soul
in
any
one
of
them
for
a
hundred
pounds
he
had
on
his
new
brown
cycling
suit
a
handsome
norfolk
jacket
thing
for
sp
and
his
legs
those
martyr
legs
were
more
than
consoled
by
thick
chequered
stockings
in
the
foot
thick
in
the
leg
for
all
they
had
endured
a
neat
packet
of
american
cloth
behind
the
saddle
contained
his
change
of
raiment
and
the
bell
and
the
and
the
hubs
and
lamp
albeit
a
trifle
freckled
by
wear
glittered
blindingly
in
the
rising
sunlight
and
at
the
top
of
the
hill
after
only
one
unsuccessful
attempt
which
somehow
terminated
on
the
green
hoopdriver
mounted
and
with
a
stately
and
cautious
restraint
in
his
pace
and
a
dignified
curvature
of
path
began
his
great
cycling
tour
along
the
southern
coast
there
is
only
one
phrase
to
describe
his
course
at
this
stage
and
that
is
voluptuous
curves
he
did
not
ride
fast
he
did
not
ride
straight
an
exacting
critic
might
say
he
did
not
ride
well
but
he
rode
generously
opulently
using
the
whole
road
and
even
nibbling
at
the
footpath
the
excitement
never
flagged
so
far
he
had
never
passed
or
been
passed
by
anything
but
as
yet
the
day
was
young
and
the
road
was
clear
he
doubted
his
steering
so
much
that
for
the
present
he
had
resolved
to
dismount
at
the
approach
of
anything
else
upon
wheels
the
shadows
of
the
trees
lay
very
long
and
blue
across
the
road
the
morning
sunlight
was
like
amber
fire
at
the
at
the
top
of
west
hill
where
the
cattle
trough
stands
he
turned
towards
kingston
and
set
himself
to
scale
the
little
bit
of
ascent
an
early
in
his
velveteen
jacket
marvelled
at
his
efforts
and
while
he
yet
struggled
the
head
of
a
carter
rose
over
the
brow
at
the
sight
of
him
hoopdriver
according
to
his
previous
determination
resolved
to
dismount
he
tightened
the
brake
and
the
machine
stopped
dead
he
was
trying
to
think
what
he
did
with
his
right
leg
whilst
getting
off
he
gripped
the
handles
and
released
the
brake
standing
on
the
left
pedal
and
waving
his
right
foot
in
the
air
then
these
things
take
so
long
in
the
telling
he
found
the
machine
was
falling
over
to
the
right
while
he
was
deciding
upon
a
plan
of
action
gravitation
appears
to
have
been
busy
he
was
still
irresolute
when
he
found
the
machine
on
the
ground
himself
kneeling
upon
it
and
a
vague
feeling
in
his
mind
that
again
providence
had
dealt
harshly
with
his
shin
this
happened
when
he
was
just
level
with
the
heathkeeper
the
man
in
the
approaching
cart
stood
up
to
see
the
ruins
better
the
way
to
get
off
said
the
heathkeeper
hoopdriver
picked
up
the
machine
the
handle
was
twisted
askew
again
he
said
something
under
his
breath
he
would
have
to
unscrew
the
beastly
thing
the
way
to
get
off
repeated
the
heathkeeper
after
a
silence
know
that
said
hoopdriver
testily
determined
to
overlook
the
new
specimen
on
his
shin
at
any
cost
he
unbuckled
the
wallet
behind
the
saddle
to
get
out
a
screw
hammer
you
know
it
the
way
to
get
off
whaddyer
do
it
for
said
the
in
a
tone
of
friendly
controversy
hoopdriver
got
out
his
screw
hammer
and
went
to
the
handle
he
was
annoyed
my
business
i
suppose
he
said
fumbling
with
the
screw
the
unusual
exertion
had
made
his
hands
shake
frightfully
the
became
meditative
and
twisted
his
stick
in
his
hands
behind
his
back
broken
yer
yer
he
said
presently
just
then
the
screw
hammer
slipped
off
the
nut
hoopdriver
used
a
nasty
low
word
trying
things
them
bicycles
said
the
charitably
hoopdriver
gave
the
nut
a
vicious
turn
and
suddenly
stood
up
he
was
holding
the
front
wheel
between
his
knees
wish
said
he
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
wish
leave
off
staring
at
then
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
delivered
an
ultimatum
he
began
replacing
the
screw
hammer
in
the
wallet
the
never
moved
possibly
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
certainly
he
stared
harder
than
he
did
before
pretty
unsociable
he
said
slowly
as
hoopdriver
seized
the
handles
and
stood
ready
to
mount
as
soon
as
the
cart
had
passed
the
indignation
gathered
slowly
but
surely
you
ride
on
a
private
road
of
your
own
if
no
one
to
speak
to
you
asked
the
perceiving
more
and
more
clearly
the
bearing
of
the
matter
no
one
make
a
remark
to
you
touchy
i
good
enough
to
speak
to
you
been
struck
wooden
all
of
a
sudden
hoopdriver
stared
into
the
immensity
of
the
future
he
was
rigid
with
emotion
it
was
like
abusing
the
lions
in
trafalgar
square
but
the
heathkeeper
felt
his
honour
was
at
stake
you
make
no
remarks
to
said
the
keeper
as
the
carter
came
up
broadside
to
them
a
dook
is
converse
with
no
one
under
a
earl
off
to
windsor
is
why
his
out
so
haughty
pride
why
got
so
much
of
it
has
to
carry
some
of
it
in
that
there
bundle
there
for
fear
bust
if
ease
hisself
a
bit
but
hoopdriver
heard
no
more
he
was
hopping
vigorously
along
the
road
in
a
spasmodic
attempt
to
remount
he
missed
the
treadle
once
and
swore
viciously
to
the
immense
delight
nar
said
the
in
another
moment
hoopdriver
was
up
and
after
one
terrific
lurch
of
the
machine
the
heathkeeper
dropped
out
of
earshot
hoopdriver
would
have
liked
to
look
back
at
his
enemy
but
he
usually
twisted
round
and
upset
if
he
tried
that
he
had
to
imagine
the
indignant
telling
the
carter
all
about
it
he
tried
to
infuse
as
much
disdain
aspossible
into
his
retreating
aspect
he
drove
on
his
sinuous
way
down
the
dip
by
the
new
mere
and
up
the
little
rise
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
that
drops
into
kingston
vale
and
so
remarkable
is
the
psychology
of
cycling
that
he
rode
all
the
straighter
and
easier
because
the
emotions
the
heathkeeper
had
aroused
relieved
his
mind
of
the
constant
expectation
of
collapse
that
had
previously
unnerved
him
to
ride
a
bicycle
properly
is
very
like
a
love
affair
chiefly
it
is
a
matter
of
faith
believe
you
do
it
and
the
thing
is
done
doubt
and
for
the
life
of
you
you
can
not
now
you
may
perhaps
imagine
that
as
he
rode
on
his
feelings
towards
the
were
either
vindictive
or
remorseful
vindictive
for
the
aggravation
or
remorseful
for
his
own
injudicious
display
of
ill
temper
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
nothing
of
the
sort
a
sudden
a
wonderful
gratitude
possessed
him
the
glory
of
the
holidays
had
resumed
its
sway
with
a
sudden
accession
of
splendour
at
the
crest
of
the
hill
he
put
his
feet
upon
the
footrests
and
now
riding
moderately
straight
went
with
a
palpitating
brake
down
that
excellent
descent
a
new
delight
was
in
his
eyes
quite
over
and
above
the
pleasure
of
rushing
through
the
keen
sweet
morning
air
he
reached
out
his
thumb
and
twanged
his
bell
out
of
sheer
happiness
a
dook
he
is
said
hoopdriver
to
himself
in
a
soft
undertone
as
he
went
soaring
down
the
hill
and
again
a
dook
he
opened
his
mouth
in
a
silent
laugh
it
was
having
a
decent
cut
did
it
his
social
superiority
had
been
so
evident
that
even
a
man
like
that
noticed
it
no
more
manchester
department
for
ten
days
out
of
manchester
a
man
the
draper
hoopdriver
the
hand
had
vanished
from
existence
instead
was
a
gentleman
a
man
of
pleasure
with
a
note
two
sovereigns
and
some
silver
at
various
convenient
points
of
his
person
at
any
rate
as
good
as
a
dook
if
not
precisely
in
the
peerage
involuntarily
at
the
thought
of
his
funds
right
hand
left
the
handle
and
sought
his
breast
pocket
to
be
immediately
recalled
by
a
violent
swoop
of
the
machine
towards
the
cemetery
whirroo
just
missed
that
mischievous
brutes
there
were
in
the
world
to
put
such
a
thing
in
the
road
some
blooming
or
other
ought
to
prosecute
a
few
of
these
roughs
and
the
rest
would
know
better
that
must
be
the
buckle
of
the
wallet
was
rattling
on
the
how
cheerfully
the
wheels
buzzed
the
cemetery
was
very
silent
and
peaceful
but
the
vale
was
waking
and
windows
rattled
and
squeaked
up
and
a
white
dog
came
out
of
one
of
the
houses
and
yelped
at
him
he
got
off
rather
breathless
at
the
foot
of
kingston
hill
and
pushed
up
halfway
up
an
early
milk
chariot
rattled
by
him
two
dirty
men
with
bundles
came
hurrying
down
hoopdriver
felt
sure
they
were
burglars
carrying
home
the
swag
it
was
up
kingston
hill
that
he
first
noticed
a
peculiar
feeling
a
slight
tightness
at
his
knees
but
he
noticed
too
at
the
top
that
he
rode
straighter
than
he
did
before
the
pleasure
of
riding
straight
blotted
out
these
first
intimations
of
fatigue
a
man
on
horseback
appeared
hoopdriver
in
a
tumult
of
soul
at
his
own
temerity
passed
him
then
down
the
hill
into
kingston
with
the
screw
hammer
behind
in
the
wallet
rattling
against
the
oil
can
he
passed
without
misadventure
a
van
and
a
sluggish
cartload
of
bricks
and
in
kingston
hoopdriver
with
the
most
exquisite
sensations
saw
the
shutters
half
removed
from
a
shop
and
two
yawning
youths
in
dusty
old
black
jackets
and
with
dirty
white
comforters
about
their
necks
clearing
up
the
planks
and
boxes
and
wrappers
in
the
window
preparatory
to
dressing
it
out
even
so
had
hoopdriver
been
on
the
previous
day
but
now
was
he
not
a
dook
palpably
in
the
sight
of
common
men
then
round
the
corner
to
the
right
bell
banged
furiously
and
so
along
the
road
to
surbiton
whoop
for
freedom
and
adventure
every
now
and
then
a
house
with
an
expression
of
sleepy
surprise
would
open
its
eye
as
he
passed
and
to
the
right
of
him
for
a
mile
or
so
the
weltering
thames
flashed
and
glittered
talk
of
your
joie
de
vivre
albeit
with
a
certain
cramping
sensation
about
the
knees
and
calves
slowly
forcing
itself
upon
his
attention
the
shameful
episode
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
now
you
must
understand
that
hoopdriver
was
not
one
of
your
fast
young
men
if
he
had
been
king
lemuel
he
could
not
have
profited
more
by
his
instructions
he
regarded
the
feminine
sex
as
something
to
bow
to
and
smirk
at
from
a
safe
distance
years
of
the
intimate
remoteness
of
a
counter
leave
their
mark
upon
a
man
it
was
an
adventure
for
him
to
take
one
of
the
young
ladies
of
the
establishment
to
church
on
a
sunday
few
modern
young
men
could
have
merited
less
the
epithet
but
i
have
thought
at
times
that
his
machine
may
have
had
something
of
the
blade
in
its
metal
decidedly
it
was
a
machine
with
a
past
hoopdriver
had
bought
it
from
in
putney
and
hare
said
it
had
had
several
owners
was
scarcely
the
word
for
it
and
hare
was
mildly
puzzled
that
he
should
be
selling
such
an
antiquity
he
said
it
was
perfectly
sound
if
a
little
but
he
was
absolutely
silent
about
its
moral
character
it
may
even
have
begun
its
career
with
a
poet
say
in
his
glorious
youth
it
may
have
been
the
bicycle
of
a
really
bad
man
no
one
who
has
ever
ridden
a
cycle
of
any
kind
but
will
witness
that
the
things
are
unaccountably
prone
to
pick
up
bad
habits
and
keep
them
it
is
undeniable
that
it
became
convulsed
with
the
most
violent
emotions
directly
the
young
lady
in
grey
appeared
it
began
an
absolutely
unprecedented
wabble
unprecedented
so
far
as
experience
went
it
the
most
decadent
sinuosity
it
left
a
track
like
one
of
feathers
he
suddenly
realised
too
that
his
cap
was
loose
on
his
head
and
his
breath
a
mere
remnant
the
young
lady
in
grey
was
also
riding
a
bicycle
she
was
dressed
in
a
beautiful
and
the
sun
behind
her
drew
her
outline
in
gold
and
left
the
rest
in
shadow
hoopdriver
was
dimly
aware
that
she
was
young
rather
slender
dark
and
with
a
bright
colour
and
bright
eyes
strange
doubts
possessed
him
as
to
the
nature
of
her
nether
costume
he
had
heard
of
such
things
of
course
french
perhaps
her
handles
glittered
a
jet
of
sunlight
splashed
off
her
bell
blindingly
she
was
approaching
the
high
road
along
an
affluent
from
the
villas
of
surbiton
fee
roads
converged
slantingly
she
was
travelling
at
about
the
same
pace
as
hoopdriver
the
appearances
pointed
to
a
meeting
at
the
fork
of
the
roads
hoopdriver
was
seized
with
a
horrible
conflict
of
doubts
by
contrast
with
her
he
rode
disgracefully
had
he
not
better
get
off
at
once
and
pretend
something
was
wrong
with
his
treadle
yet
even
the
end
of
getting
off
was
an
uncertainty
that
last
occasion
on
putney
heath
on
the
other
hand
what
would
happen
if
he
kept
on
to
go
very
slow
seemed
the
abnegation
of
his
manhood
to
crawl
after
a
mere
schoolgirl
besides
she
was
not
riding
very
fast
on
the
other
hand
to
thrust
himself
in
front
of
her
consuming
the
road
in
his
advance
seemed
an
incivility
greed
he
would
leave
her
such
a
very
little
his
business
training
made
him
prone
to
bow
and
step
aside
if
only
one
could
take
hands
off
the
handles
one
might
pass
with
a
silent
elevation
of
the
hat
of
course
but
even
that
was
a
little
suggestive
of
a
funeral
meanwhile
the
roads
converged
she
was
looking
at
him
she
was
flushed
a
little
thin
and
had
very
bright
eyes
her
red
lips
fell
apart
she
may
have
been
riding
hard
but
it
looked
uncommonly
like
a
faint
smile
and
the
things
were
yes
rationals
suddenly
an
impulse
to
bolt
from
the
situation
became
clamorous
hoopdriver
pedalled
convulsively
intending
to
pass
her
he
jerked
against
some
tin
thing
on
the
road
and
it
flew
up
between
front
wheel
and
he
twisted
round
towards
her
had
the
machine
a
devil
at
that
supreme
moment
it
came
across
him
that
he
would
have
done
wiser
to
dismount
he
gave
a
frantic
and
tried
to
get
round
then
as
he
seemed
falling
over
he
pulled
the
handles
straight
again
and
to
the
left
by
an
instinctive
motion
and
shot
behind
her
hind
wheel
missing
her
by
a
breadth
the
pavement
kerb
awaited
him
he
tried
to
recover
and
found
himself
jumped
up
on
the
pavement
and
riding
squarely
at
a
neat
wooden
paling
he
struck
this
with
a
terrific
impact
and
shot
forward
off
his
saddle
into
a
clumsy
entanglement
then
he
began
to
tumble
over
sideways
and
completed
the
entire
figure
in
a
sitting
position
on
the
gravel
with
his
feet
between
the
fork
and
the
stay
of
the
machine
the
concussion
on
the
gravel
shook
his
entire
being
he
remained
in
that
position
wishing
that
he
had
broken
his
neck
wishing
even
more
heartily
that
he
had
never
been
born
the
glory
of
life
had
departed
dook
indeed
these
unwomanly
women
there
was
a
soft
whirr
the
click
of
a
brake
two
footfalls
and
the
young
lady
in
grey
stood
holding
her
machine
she
had
turned
round
and
come
back
to
him
the
warm
sunlight
now
was
in
her
face
you
hurt
she
said
she
had
a
pretty
clear
girlish
voice
she
was
really
very
young
quite
a
girl
in
fact
and
rode
so
well
it
was
a
bitter
draught
hoopdriver
stood
up
at
once
a
bit
he
said
a
little
ruefully
he
became
painfully
aware
that
large
patches
of
gravel
scarcely
improve
the
appearance
of
a
norfolk
suit
very
sorry
indeed
my
fault
she
said
interrupting
and
so
saving
him
on
the
very
verge
of
calling
her
he
knew
was
wrong
but
it
was
habit
with
him
tried
to
pass
you
on
the
wrong
her
face
and
eyes
seemed
all
alive
my
place
to
be
it
was
my
steering
ought
to
have
seen
you
were
a
with
a
touch
of
superiority
you
rode
so
straight
coming
along
there
she
really
was
dashed
pretty
feelings
passed
the
nadir
when
he
spoke
again
there
was
the
faintest
flavour
of
the
aristocratic
in
his
voice
my
first
ride
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
no
excuse
for
my
ah
blundering
bleeding
she
said
abruptly
he
saw
his
knuckle
was
barked
feel
it
he
said
feeling
manly
at
first
have
you
any
if
not
she
balanced
her
machine
against
herself
she
had
a
little
side
pocket
and
she
whipped
out
a
small
packet
of
with
a
pair
of
scissors
in
a
sheath
at
the
side
and
cut
off
a
generous
portion
he
had
a
wild
impulse
to
ask
her
to
stick
it
on
for
him
controlled
you
he
said
all
right
she
asked
looking
past
him
at
the
prostrate
vehicle
her
hands
on
her
for
the
first
time
hoopdriver
did
not
feel
proud
of
his
machine
he
turned
and
began
to
pick
up
the
fallen
fabric
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
she
was
gone
turned
his
head
over
the
other
shoulder
down
the
road
and
she
was
riding
off
said
hoopdriver
blowed
talk
about
slap
up
his
aristocratic
refinement
rarely
adorned
his
speech
in
his
private
soliloquies
his
mind
was
whirling
one
fact
was
clear
a
most
delightful
and
novel
human
being
had
flashed
across
his
horizon
and
was
going
out
of
his
life
again
the
holiday
madness
was
in
his
blood
she
looked
round
at
that
he
rushed
his
machine
into
the
road
and
began
a
hasty
ascent
unsuccessful
try
again
confound
it
will
he
never
be
able
to
get
up
on
the
thing
again
she
will
be
round
the
corner
in
a
minute
once
more
ah
pedal
wabble
no
right
this
time
he
gripped
the
handles
and
put
his
head
down
he
would
overtake
her
the
situation
was
primordial
the
man
beneath
prevailed
for
a
moment
over
the
civilised
superstructure
the
draper
he
pushed
at
the
pedals
with
archaic
violence
so
palaeolithic
man
may
have
ridden
his
simple
bicycle
of
chipped
flint
in
pursuit
of
his
exogamous
affinity
she
vanished
round
the
corner
his
effort
was
titanic
what
should
he
say
when
he
overtook
her
that
scarcely
disturbed
him
at
first
how
fine
she
had
looked
flushed
with
the
exertion
of
riding
breathing
a
little
fast
but
elastic
and
active
talk
about
your
ladylike
homekeeping
girls
with
complexions
like
cold
veal
but
what
should
he
say
to
her
that
was
a
bother
and
he
could
not
lift
his
cap
without
risking
a
repetition
of
his
previous
ignominy
she
was
a
real
young
lady
no
mistake
about
that
none
of
your
blooming
shop
girls
there
is
no
greater
contempt
in
the
world
than
that
of
shop
men
for
shop
girls
unless
it
be
that
of
shop
girls
for
shop
men
phew
this
was
work
a
certain
numbness
came
and
went
at
his
knees
i
ask
to
whom
i
am
indebted
he
panted
to
himself
trying
it
over
that
might
do
lucky
he
had
a
card
case
a
hundred
a
shilling
while
you
wait
he
was
getting
winded
the
road
was
certainly
a
bit
uphill
he
turned
the
corner
and
saw
a
long
stretch
of
road
and
a
grey
dress
vanishing
he
set
his
teeth
had
he
gained
on
her
at
all
on
a
gridiron
yelped
a
small
boy
hoopdriver
redoubled
his
efforts
his
breath
became
audible
his
steering
unsteady
his
pedalling
positively
ferocious
a
drop
of
perspiration
ran
into
his
eye
irritant
as
acid
the
road
really
was
uphill
beyond
dispute
all
his
physiology
began
to
cry
out
at
him
a
last
tremendous
effort
brought
him
to
the
corner
and
showed
yet
another
extent
of
shady
roadway
empty
save
for
a
van
his
front
wheel
suddenly
shrieked
aloud
lord
said
hoopdriver
relaxing
anyhow
she
was
not
in
sight
he
got
off
unsteadily
and
for
a
moment
his
legs
felt
like
wisps
of
cotton
he
balanced
his
machine
against
the
grassy
edge
of
the
path
and
sat
down
panting
his
hands
were
gnarled
with
swollen
veins
and
shaking
palpably
his
breath
came
viscid
hardly
in
training
yet
he
remarked
his
legs
had
gone
leaden
feel
as
though
had
a
mouthful
of
presently
he
slapped
his
side
pocket
and
produced
therefrom
a
cigarette
case
and
a
packet
of
red
herring
cigarettes
he
filled
the
case
then
his
eye
fell
with
a
sudden
approval
on
the
ornamental
chequering
of
his
new
stockings
the
expression
in
his
eyes
faded
slowly
to
abstract
meditation
was
a
stunning
girl
he
said
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
set
eyes
on
her
again
and
she
knew
how
to
ride
too
wonder
what
she
thought
of
the
phrase
floated
into
his
mind
with
a
certain
flavour
of
comfort
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
smoking
and
meditating
he
did
not
even
look
up
when
vehicles
passed
it
was
perhaps
ten
minutes
before
he
roused
himself
rot
it
is
the
good
of
thinking
such
things
he
said
only
a
blessed
to
be
exact
he
did
not
say
blessed
the
service
of
a
shop
may
polish
a
exterior
ways
but
the
dormitory
is
an
indifferent
school
for
either
manners
or
morals
he
stood
up
and
began
wheeling
his
machine
towards
esher
it
was
going
to
be
a
beautiful
day
and
the
hedges
and
trees
and
the
open
country
were
all
glorious
to
his
eyes
but
it
was
a
little
different
from
the
elation
of
his
start
at
the
gentleman
wizzer
bicitle
said
a
nursemaid
on
the
path
to
a
personage
in
a
perambulator
that
healed
him
a
little
wizzer
bicitle
i
look
so
very
seedy
he
said
to
himself
wonder
i
should
just
like
to
know
there
was
something
very
comforting
in
the
track
of
her
pneumatic
running
straight
and
steady
along
the
road
before
him
it
must
be
hers
no
other
pneumatic
had
been
along
the
road
that
morning
it
was
just
possible
of
course
that
he
might
see
her
once
more
coming
back
should
he
try
and
say
something
smart
he
speculated
what
manner
of
girl
she
might
be
probably
she
was
one
of
these
here
new
women
he
had
a
persuasion
the
cult
had
been
maligned
anyhow
she
was
a
lady
and
rich
people
too
her
machine
have
cost
much
under
twenty
pounds
his
mind
came
round
and
dwelt
some
time
on
her
visible
self
rational
dress
look
a
bit
unwomanly
however
he
disdained
to
be
one
of
your
then
his
thoughts
drove
off
at
a
tangent
he
would
certainly
have
to
get
something
to
eat
at
the
next
public
house
vi
on
the
road
to
ripley
in
the
fulness
of
time
hoopdriver
drew
near
the
marquis
of
granby
at
esher
and
as
he
came
under
the
railway
arch
and
saw
the
inn
in
front
of
him
he
mounted
his
machine
again
and
rode
bravely
up
to
the
doorway
burton
and
biscuit
and
cheese
he
had
which
indeed
is
burton
in
its
proper
company
and
as
he
was
eating
there
came
a
middleaged
man
in
a
drab
cycling
suit
very
red
and
moist
and
angry
in
the
face
and
asked
bitterly
for
a
lemon
squash
and
he
sat
down
upon
the
seat
in
the
bar
and
mopped
his
face
but
scarcely
had
he
sat
down
before
he
got
up
again
and
stared
out
of
the
doorway
said
he
then
fool
said
hoopdriver
looking
round
suddenly
with
a
piece
of
cheese
in
his
cheek
the
man
in
drab
faced
him
called
myself
a
damned
fool
sir
have
you
any
objections
none
none
said
hoopdriver
thought
you
spoke
to
me
i
hear
what
you
have
a
contemplative
disposition
and
an
energetic
temperament
sir
is
hell
hell
i
tell
you
a
contemplative
disposition
and
a
phlegmatic
temperament
all
very
well
but
energy
and
philosophy
hoopdriver
looked
as
intelligent
as
he
could
but
said
nothing
no
hurry
sir
none
whatever
i
came
out
for
exercise
gentle
exercise
and
to
notice
the
scenery
and
to
botanise
and
no
sooner
do
i
get
on
the
accursed
machine
than
off
i
go
hammer
and
tongs
i
never
look
to
right
or
left
never
notice
a
flower
never
see
a
view
get
hot
juicy
red
like
a
grilled
chop
here
i
am
sir
come
from
guildford
in
something
under
the
hour
why
sir
hoopdriver
shook
his
head
a
damned
fool
sir
because
reservoirs
and
reservoirs
of
muscular
energy
and
one
or
other
of
them
is
always
leaking
a
most
interesting
road
birds
and
trees
no
doubt
and
wayside
flowers
and
nothing
i
should
enjoy
more
than
watching
them
but
i
get
me
on
that
machine
and
i
have
to
go
get
me
on
anything
and
i
have
to
go
and
i
want
to
go
a
bit
why
should
a
man
rush
about
like
a
rocket
all
pace
and
fizzle
why
it
makes
me
furious
i
can
assure
you
sir
i
go
scorching
along
the
road
and
cursing
aloud
at
myself
for
doing
it
a
quiet
dignified
philosophical
man
what
i
am
at
bottom
and
here
i
am
dancing
with
rage
and
swearing
like
a
drunken
tinker
at
a
perfect
stranger
my
wasted
lost
all
that
country
road
and
now
on
the
fringe
of
london
and
i
might
have
loitered
all
the
morning
ugh
thank
heaven
sir
you
have
not
the
irritable
temperament
that
you
are
not
goaded
to
madness
by
your
endogenous
sneers
by
the
eternal
wrangling
of
an
uncomfortable
soul
and
body
i
tell
you
i
lead
a
cat
and
dog
life
but
what
is
the
use
of
talking
all
of
a
piece
he
tossed
his
head
with
unspeakable
pitched
the
lemon
squash
into
his
mouth
paid
for
it
and
without
any
further
remark
strode
to
the
door
hoopdriver
was
still
wondering
what
to
say
when
his
interlocutor
vanished
there
was
a
noise
of
a
foot
spurning
the
gravel
and
when
hoopdriver
reached
the
doorway
the
man
in
drab
was
a
score
of
yards
londonward
he
had
already
gathered
pace
he
pedalled
with
anger
and
his
head
was
going
down
in
another
moment
he
flew
swiftly
out
of
sight
under
the
railway
arch
and
hoopdriver
saw
him
no
more
vii
after
this
whirlwind
hoopdriver
paid
his
reckoning
and
being
now
a
little
rested
about
the
muscles
of
the
knees
resumed
his
saddle
and
rode
on
in
the
direction
of
ripley
along
an
excellent
but
undulating
road
he
was
pleased
to
find
his
command
over
his
machine
already
sensibly
increased
he
set
himself
little
exercises
as
he
went
along
and
performed
them
with
variable
success
there
was
for
instance
steering
in
between
a
couple
of
stones
say
a
foot
apart
a
deed
of
little
difficulty
as
far
as
the
front
wheel
is
concerned
but
the
back
wheel
not
being
under
the
sway
of
the
human
eye
is
apt
to
take
a
vicious
jump
over
the
obstacle
which
sends
a
violent
concussion
all
along
the
spine
to
the
skull
and
will
even
jerk
a
loosely
fastened
hat
over
the
eyes
and
so
lead
to
much
confusion
and
again
there
was
taking
the
hand
or
hands
off
the
handlebar
a
thing
simple
in
itself
but
complex
in
its
consequences
this
particularly
was
a
feat
hoopdriver
desired
to
do
for
several
divergent
reasons
but
at
present
it
simply
led
to
convulsive
balancings
and
novel
and
inelegant
modes
of
dismounting
the
human
nose
is
at
its
best
a
needless
excrescence
there
are
those
who
consider
it
ornamental
and
would
regard
a
face
deprived
of
its
assistance
with
pity
or
derision
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
our
esteem
is
dictated
so
much
by
a
sense
of
its
absolute
beauty
as
by
the
vitiating
effect
of
a
universally
prevalent
fashion
in
the
case
of
bicycle
students
as
in
the
young
of
both
sexes
its
inutility
is
aggravated
by
its
persistent
annoyance
it
requires
constant
attention
until
one
can
ride
with
one
hand
and
search
for
secure
and
use
a
pocket
handkerchief
with
the
other
cycling
is
necessarily
a
constant
series
of
descents
nothing
can
be
further
from
the
ambition
than
a
wanton
realism
but
nose
is
a
plain
and
salient
fact
and
face
it
we
must
and
in
addition
to
this
inconvenience
there
are
flies
until
the
cyclist
can
steer
with
one
hand
his
face
is
given
over
to
beelzebub
contemplative
flies
stroll
over
it
and
trifle
absently
with
its
most
sensitive
surfaces
the
only
way
to
dislodge
them
is
to
shake
the
head
forcibly
and
to
writhe
features
violently
this
is
not
only
a
lengthy
and
frequently
ineffectual
method
but
one
exceedingly
terrifying
to
foot
passengers
and
again
sometimes
the
beginner
rides
for
a
space
with
one
eye
closed
by
perspiration
giving
him
a
waggish
air
foreign
to
his
mood
and
ill
calculated
to
overawe
the
impertinent
however
you
will
appreciate
now
the
motive
of
experiments
he
presently
attained
sufficient
dexterity
to
slap
himself
smartly
and
violently
in
the
face
with
his
right
hand
without
certainly
overturning
the
machine
but
his
pocket
handkerchief
might
have
been
in
california
for
any
good
it
was
to
him
while
he
was
in
the
saddle
yet
you
must
not
think
that
because
hoopdriver
was
a
little
uncomfortable
he
was
unhappy
in
the
slightest
degree
in
the
background
of
his
consciousness
was
the
sense
that
about
this
time
briggs
would
be
through
his
window
dressing
and
gosling
the
apprentice
busy
with
a
chair
turned
down
over
the
counter
and
his
ears
very
red
trying
to
roll
a
piece
of
huckaback
only
those
who
have
rolled
pieces
of
huckaback
know
quite
how
detestable
huckaback
is
to
roll
and
the
shop
would
be
dusty
and
perhaps
the
governor
about
and
snappy
and
here
was
quiet
and
greenery
and
one
mucked
about
as
the
desire
took
one
without
a
soul
to
see
and
here
was
no
wailing
of
no
folding
of
remnants
no
voice
to
shout
forward
and
once
he
almost
ran
over
something
wonderful
a
little
low
red
beast
with
a
yellowish
tail
that
went
rushing
across
the
road
before
him
it
was
the
first
weasel
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
cockney
life
there
were
miles
of
this
scores
of
miles
of
this
before
him
pinewood
and
oak
forest
purple
heathery
moorland
and
grassy
down
lush
meadows
where
shining
rivers
wound
their
lazy
way
villages
with
flint
churches
and
rambling
cheap
and
hearty
inns
clean
white
country
towns
long
downhill
stretches
where
one
might
ride
at
ease
overlooking
a
jolt
or
so
and
far
away
at
the
end
of
it
all
the
sea
what
mattered
a
fly
or
so
in
the
dawn
of
these
delights
perhaps
he
had
been
dashed
a
minute
by
the
shameful
episode
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
and
perhaps
the
memory
of
it
was
making
itself
a
little
lair
in
a
corner
of
his
brain
from
which
it
could
distress
him
in
the
retrospect
by
suggesting
that
he
looked
like
a
fool
but
for
the
present
that
trouble
was
altogether
in
abeyance
the
man
in
drab
evidently
a
swell
had
spoken
to
him
as
his
equal
and
the
knees
of
his
brown
suit
and
the
chequered
stockings
were
ever
before
his
eyes
or
rather
you
could
see
the
stockings
by
carrying
the
head
a
little
to
one
side
and
to
feel
little
by
little
his
mastery
over
this
delightful
treacherous
machine
growing
and
growing
every
or
so
his
knees
reasserted
themselves
and
he
dismounted
and
sat
awhile
by
the
roadside
it
was
at
a
charming
little
place
between
esher
and
cobham
where
a
bridge
crosses
a
stream
that
hoopdriver
came
across
the
other
cyclist
in
brown
it
is
well
to
notice
the
fact
here
although
the
interview
was
of
the
slightest
because
it
happened
that
subsequently
hoopdriver
saw
a
great
deal
more
of
this
other
man
in
brown
the
other
cyclist
in
brown
had
a
machine
of
dazzling
newness
and
a
punctured
pneumatic
lay
across
his
knees
he
was
a
man
of
thirty
or
more
with
a
whitish
face
an
aquiline
nose
a
lank
flaxen
moustache
and
very
fair
hair
and
he
scowled
at
the
job
before
him
at
the
sight
of
him
hoopdriver
pulled
himself
together
and
rode
by
with
the
air
of
one
born
to
the
wheel
splendid
morning
said
hoopdriver
a
fine
morning
and
you
and
the
surface
be
everlastingly
damned
said
the
other
man
in
brown
as
hoopdriver
receded
hoopdriver
heard
the
mumble
and
did
not
distinguish
the
words
and
he
felt
a
pleasing
sense
of
having
duly
asserted
the
wide
sympathy
that
binds
all
cyclists
together
of
having
behaved
himself
as
becomes
one
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
wheel
the
other
man
in
brown
watched
his
receding
aspect
proletarian
said
the
other
man
in
brown
feeling
a
prophetic
dislike
a
suit
of
brown
the
very
picture
of
this
one
would
think
his
sole
aim
in
life
had
been
to
caricature
me
way
with
me
look
at
his
insteps
on
the
treadles
why
does
heaven
make
such
men
and
having
lit
a
cigarette
the
other
man
in
brown
returned
to
the
business
in
hand
hoopdriver
worked
up
the
hill
towards
cobham
to
a
point
that
he
felt
sure
was
out
of
sight
of
the
other
man
in
brown
and
then
he
dismounted
and
pushed
his
machine
until
the
proximity
of
the
village
and
a
proper
pride
drove
him
into
the
saddle
again
viii
beyond
cobham
came
a
delightful
incident
delightful
that
is
in
its
beginning
if
a
trifle
indeterminate
in
the
retrospect
it
was
perhaps
between
cobham
and
ripley
hoopdriver
dropped
down
a
little
hill
where
unfenced
from
the
road
fine
mossy
trees
and
bracken
lay
on
either
side
and
looking
up
he
saw
an
open
country
before
him
covered
with
heather
and
set
with
pines
and
a
yellow
road
running
across
it
and
half
a
mile
away
perhaps
a
little
grey
figure
by
the
wayside
waving
something
white
said
hoopdriver
with
his
hands
tightening
on
the
handles
he
resumed
the
treadles
staring
away
before
him
jolted
over
a
stone
wabbled
recovered
and
began
riding
faster
at
once
with
his
eyes
ahead
be
said
hoopdriver
he
rode
his
straightest
and
kept
his
pedals
spinning
albeit
a
limp
numbness
had
resumed
possession
of
his
legs
be
he
repeated
feeling
every
moment
more
assured
that
it
was
i
know
even
now
said
hoopdriver
legs
awhirling
and
then
my
legs
but
he
kept
on
and
drew
nearer
and
nearer
breathing
hard
and
gathering
flies
like
a
flypaper
in
the
valley
he
was
hidden
then
the
road
began
to
rise
and
the
resistance
of
the
pedals
grew
as
he
crested
the
hill
he
saw
her
not
a
hundred
yards
away
from
him
her
he
said
her
right
enough
the
done
it
which
was
truer
even
than
hoopdriver
thought
but
now
she
was
not
waving
her
handkerchief
she
was
not
even
looking
at
him
she
was
wheeling
her
machine
slowly
along
the
road
towards
him
and
admiring
the
pretty
wooded
hills
towards
weybridge
she
might
have
been
unaware
of
his
existence
for
all
the
recognition
he
got
for
a
moment
horrible
doubts
troubled
hoopdriver
had
that
handkerchief
been
a
dream
besides
which
he
was
deliquescent
and
scarlet
and
felt
so
it
must
be
her
coquetry
the
handkerchief
was
indisputable
should
he
ride
up
to
her
and
get
off
or
get
off
and
ride
up
to
her
it
was
as
well
she
look
because
he
would
certainly
capsize
if
he
lifted
his
cap
perhaps
that
was
her
consideration
even
as
he
hesitated
he
was
upon
her
she
must
have
heard
his
breathing
he
gripped
the
brake
steady
his
right
leg
waved
in
the
air
and
he
came
down
heavily
and
staggering
but
erect
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
with
admirable
surprise
hoopdriver
tried
to
smile
pleasantly
hold
up
his
machine
raise
his
cap
and
bow
gracefully
indeed
he
felt
that
he
did
as
much
he
was
a
man
singularly
devoid
of
the
minutiae
of
and
he
was
quite
unaware
of
a
tail
of
damp
hair
lying
across
his
forehead
and
just
clearing
his
eyes
and
of
the
general
disorder
of
his
coiffure
there
was
an
interrogative
pause
can
i
have
the
pleasure
began
haopdriver
insinuatingly
remembering
his
emancipation
and
abruptly
assuming
his
most
aristocratic
intonation
i
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
the
young
lady
in
grey
bit
her
lower
lip
and
said
very
prettily
thank
she
glanced
away
from
him
and
made
as
if
she
would
proceed
said
hoopdriver
taken
aback
and
suddenly
crestfallen
again
it
was
so
unexpected
he
tried
to
grasp
the
situation
was
she
coquetting
or
had
he
me
one
minute
he
said
as
she
began
to
wheel
her
machine
again
she
said
stopping
and
staring
a
little
with
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
deepening
should
not
have
alighted
if
i
had
not
imagined
that
you
er
waved
something
white
he
paused
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
he
had
seen
it
she
decided
that
he
was
not
an
unredeemed
rough
taking
advantage
of
a
mistake
but
an
innocent
soul
meaning
well
while
seeking
happiness
did
wave
my
handkerchief
she
said
very
sorry
i
am
expecting
a
friend
a
gentleman
she
seemed
to
flush
pink
for
a
minute
is
riding
a
bicycle
and
dressed
in
in
brown
and
at
a
distance
you
know
quite
said
hoopdriver
bearing
up
in
manly
fashion
against
his
bitter
disappointment
awfully
sorry
you
know
troubling
you
to
dismount
and
all
trouble
you
said
hoopdriver
mechanically
and
bowing
over
his
saddle
as
if
it
was
a
counter
somehow
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
tell
her
that
the
man
was
beyond
there
with
a
punctured
pneumatic
he
looked
back
along
the
road
and
tried
to
think
of
something
else
to
say
but
the
gulf
in
the
conversation
widened
rapidly
and
hopelessly
nothing
further
began
hoopdriver
desperately
recurring
to
his
stock
of
cliches
thank
you
she
said
decisively
and
immediately
is
the
ripley
road
said
hoopdriver
is
about
two
miles
from
here
according
to
the
you
she
said
warmly
you
so
much
i
felt
sure
there
was
no
mistake
and
i
really
am
awfully
sorry
mention
it
said
hoopdriver
mention
he
hesitated
and
gripped
his
handles
to
mount
me
he
said
to
be
should
he
say
it
was
it
an
impertinence
anyhow
being
the
other
gentleman
you
he
tried
a
quietly
insinuating
smile
that
he
knew
for
a
grin
even
as
he
smiled
it
felt
she
disapproved
that
she
despised
him
was
overcome
with
shame
at
her
expression
turned
his
back
upon
her
and
began
very
clumsily
to
mount
he
did
so
with
a
horrible
swerve
and
went
pedalling
off
riding
very
badly
as
he
was
only
too
painfully
aware
nevertheless
thank
heaven
for
the
mounting
he
could
not
see
her
because
it
was
so
dangerous
for
him
to
look
round
but
he
could
imagine
her
indignant
and
pitiless
he
felt
an
unspeakable
idiot
one
had
to
be
so
careful
what
one
said
to
young
ladies
and
gone
and
treated
her
just
as
though
she
was
only
a
larky
girl
it
was
unforgivable
he
always
was
a
fool
you
could
tell
from
her
manner
she
think
him
a
gentleman
one
glance
and
she
seemed
to
look
clear
through
him
and
all
his
presence
what
rot
it
was
venturing
to
speak
to
a
girl
like
that
with
her
education
she
was
bound
to
see
through
him
at
once
how
nicely
she
spoke
too
nice
words
she
made
him
feel
what
slush
his
own
accent
was
and
that
last
silly
remark
what
was
it
being
the
other
gentleman
you
know
no
point
in
it
and
what
could
she
be
thinking
of
him
but
really
the
young
lady
in
grey
had
dismissed
hoopdriver
from
her
thoughts
almost
before
he
had
vanished
round
the
corner
she
had
thought
no
ill
of
him
his
manifest
awe
and
admiration
of
her
had
given
her
not
an
atom
of
offence
but
for
her
just
now
there
were
weightier
things
to
think
about
things
that
would
affect
all
the
rest
of
her
life
she
continued
slowly
walking
her
machine
londonward
presently
she
stopped
why
he
come
she
said
and
stamped
her
foot
petulantly
then
as
if
in
answer
coming
down
the
hill
among
the
trees
appeared
the
other
man
in
brown
dismounted
and
wheeling
his
machine
ix
how
hoopdriver
was
haunted
as
hoopdriver
rode
swaggering
along
the
ripley
road
it
came
to
him
with
an
unwarrantable
sense
of
comfort
that
he
had
seen
the
last
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
but
the
bladery
of
the
machine
the
present
machinery
of
fate
the
deus
ex
machina
so
to
speak
was
against
him
the
bicycle
torn
from
this
attractive
young
woman
grew
heavier
and
heavier
and
continually
more
unsteady
it
seemed
a
choice
between
stopping
at
ripley
or
dying
in
the
flower
of
his
days
he
went
into
the
unicorn
after
propping
his
machine
outside
the
door
and
as
he
cooled
down
and
smoked
his
red
herring
cigarette
while
the
cold
meat
was
getting
ready
he
saw
from
the
window
the
young
lady
in
grey
and
the
other
man
in
brown
entering
ripley
they
filled
him
with
apprehension
by
looking
at
the
house
which
sheltered
him
but
the
sight
of
his
bicycle
propped
in
a
drunk
and
incapable
attitude
against
the
doorway
humping
its
rackety
and
leering
at
them
with
its
darkened
lantern
eye
drove
them
away
so
it
seemed
to
hoopdriver
to
the
spacious
swallow
of
the
golden
dragon
the
young
lady
was
riding
very
slowly
but
the
other
man
in
brown
had
a
bad
puncture
and
was
wheeling
his
machine
hoopdriver
noted
his
flaxen
moustache
his
aquiline
nose
his
rather
bent
shoulders
with
a
sudden
vivid
dislike
the
maid
at
the
unicorn
is
naturally
a
pleasant
girl
but
she
is
jaded
by
the
incessant
incidence
of
cyclists
and
mind
even
as
he
conversed
with
her
in
that
cultivated
voice
of
his
of
the
weather
of
the
distance
from
london
and
of
the
excellence
of
the
ripley
road
wandered
to
the
incomparable
freshness
and
brilliance
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
as
he
sat
at
meat
he
kept
turning
his
head
to
the
window
to
see
what
signs
there
were
of
that
person
but
the
face
of
the
golden
dragon
displayed
no
appreciation
of
the
delightful
morsel
it
had
swallowed
as
an
incidental
consequence
of
this
distraction
hoopdriver
was
for
a
minute
greatly
inconvenienced
by
a
mouthful
of
mustard
after
he
had
called
for
his
reckoning
he
went
his
courage
being
high
with
meat
and
mustard
to
the
door
intending
to
stand
with
his
legs
wide
apart
and
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
stare
boldly
across
the
road
but
just
then
the
other
man
in
brown
appeared
in
the
gateway
of
the
golden
dragon
yard
it
is
one
of
those
delightful
inns
that
date
from
the
coaching
days
wheeling
his
punctured
machine
he
was
taking
it
to
the
he
looked
up
and
saw
hoopdriver
stared
for
a
minute
and
then
scowled
darkly
but
hoopdriver
remained
stoutly
in
the
doorway
until
the
other
man
in
brown
had
disappeared
into
then
he
glanced
momentarily
at
the
golden
dragon
puckered
his
mouth
into
a
whistle
of
unconcern
and
proceeded
to
wheel
his
machine
into
the
road
until
a
sufficient
margin
for
mounting
was
secured
now
at
that
time
i
say
hoopdriver
was
rather
desirous
than
not
of
seeing
no
more
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
the
other
man
in
brown
he
guessed
was
her
brother
albeit
that
person
was
of
a
pallid
fairness
differing
essentially
from
her
rich
colouring
and
besides
he
felt
he
had
made
a
hopeless
fool
of
himself
but
the
afternoon
was
against
him
intolerably
hot
especially
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
the
virtue
had
gone
out
of
his
legs
to
digest
his
cold
meat
and
altogether
his
ride
to
guildford
was
exceedingly
intermittent
at
times
he
would
walk
at
times
lounge
by
the
wayside
and
every
public
house
in
spite
of
briggs
and
a
sentiment
of
economy
meant
a
lemonade
and
a
dash
of
bitter
for
that
is
the
experience
of
all
those
who
go
on
wheels
that
drinking
begets
thirst
even
more
than
thirst
begets
drinking
until
at
last
the
man
who
yields
becomes
a
hell
unto
himself
a
hell
in
which
the
fire
dieth
not
and
the
thirst
is
not
quenched
until
a
pennyworth
of
acrid
green
apples
turned
the
current
that
threatened
to
carry
him
away
ever
and
again
a
cycle
or
a
party
of
cyclists
would
go
by
with
glittering
wheels
and
softly
running
chains
and
on
each
occasion
to
save
his
hoopdriver
descended
and
feigned
some
trouble
with
his
saddle
each
time
he
descended
with
less
trepidation
he
did
not
reach
guildford
until
nearly
four
and
then
he
was
so
much
exhausted
that
he
decided
to
put
up
there
for
the
night
at
the
yellow
hammer
coffee
tavern
and
after
he
had
cooled
a
space
and
refreshed
himself
with
tea
and
bread
and
butter
and
jam
the
tea
he
drank
noisily
out
of
the
saucer
he
went
out
to
loiter
away
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
guildford
is
an
altogether
charming
old
town
famous
so
he
learnt
from
a
guide
book
as
the
scene
of
master
great
historical
novel
of
stephen
langton
and
it
has
a
delightful
castle
all
set
about
with
geraniums
and
brass
plates
commemorating
the
gentlemen
who
put
them
up
and
its
guildhall
is
a
tudor
building
very
pleasant
to
see
and
in
the
afternoon
the
shops
are
busy
and
the
people
going
to
and
fro
make
the
pavements
look
bright
and
prosperous
it
was
nice
to
peep
in
the
windows
and
see
the
heads
of
the
men
and
girls
in
the
shops
busy
as
busy
serving
away
the
high
street
runs
down
at
an
angle
of
seventy
degrees
to
the
horizon
so
it
seemed
to
hoopdriver
whose
feeling
for
gradients
was
unnaturally
exalted
and
it
brought
his
heart
into
his
mouth
to
see
a
cyclist
ride
down
it
like
a
fly
crawling
down
a
window
pane
the
man
even
a
brake
he
visited
the
castle
early
in
the
evening
and
paid
his
twopence
to
ascend
the
keep
at
the
top
from
the
cage
he
looked
down
over
the
clustering
red
roofs
of
the
town
and
the
tower
of
the
church
and
then
going
to
the
southern
side
sat
down
and
lit
a
red
herring
cigarette
and
stared
away
south
over
the
old
ruin
at
the
waves
of
blue
upland
that
rose
one
behind
another
across
the
weald
to
the
lazy
altitudes
of
hindhead
and
butser
his
pale
grey
eyes
were
full
of
complacency
and
pleasurable
anticipation
tomorrow
he
would
go
riding
across
that
wide
valley
he
did
not
notice
any
one
else
had
come
up
the
keep
after
him
until
he
heard
a
soft
voice
behind
him
saying
miss
beaumont
the
something
in
the
accent
pointed
to
a
jest
in
the
name
a
dear
old
town
brother
george
answered
another
voice
that
sounded
familiar
enough
and
turning
his
head
hoopdriver
saw
the
other
man
in
brown
and
the
young
lady
in
grey
with
their
backs
towards
him
she
turned
her
smiling
profile
towards
hoopdriver
you
know
brothers
call
their
sisters
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
hoopdriver
said
the
other
man
in
brown
quite
audibly
starting
as
he
followed
her
glance
hoopdriver
with
a
fine
air
of
indifference
resumed
the
weald
old
town
it
said
the
other
man
in
brown
after
a
quite
perceptible
pause
it
said
the
young
lady
in
grey
another
pause
began
get
alone
anywhere
said
the
other
man
in
brown
looking
round
then
hoopdriver
perceived
clearly
that
he
was
in
the
way
and
decided
to
retreat
it
was
just
his
luck
of
course
that
he
should
stumble
at
the
head
of
the
steps
and
vanish
with
indignity
this
was
the
third
time
that
seen
him
and
the
fourth
time
her
and
of
course
he
was
too
big
a
to
raise
his
cap
to
her
he
thought
of
that
at
the
foot
of
the
keep
apparently
they
aimed
at
the
south
coast
just
as
he
did
get
up
betimes
the
next
day
and
hurry
off
to
avoid
her
them
that
is
it
never
occurred
to
hoopdriver
that
miss
beaumont
and
her
brother
might
do
exactly
the
same
thing
and
that
evening
at
least
the
peculiarity
of
a
brother
calling
his
sister
did
not
recur
to
him
he
was
much
too
preoccupied
with
an
analysis
of
his
own
share
of
these
encounters
he
found
it
hard
to
be
altogether
satisfied
about
the
figure
he
had
cut
revise
his
memories
as
he
would
once
more
quite
unintentionally
he
stumbled
upon
these
two
people
it
was
about
seven
he
stopped
outside
a
linen
and
peered
over
the
goods
in
the
window
at
the
assistants
in
torment
he
could
have
spent
a
whole
day
happily
at
that
he
told
himself
that
he
was
trying
to
see
how
they
dressed
out
the
brass
lines
over
their
counters
in
a
purely
professional
spirit
but
down
at
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
he
knew
better
the
customers
were
a
secondary
consideration
and
it
was
only
after
the
lapse
of
perhaps
a
minute
that
he
perceived
that
among
them
was
the
young
lady
in
grey
he
turned
away
from
the
window
at
once
and
saw
the
other
man
in
brown
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
regarding
him
with
a
very
curious
expression
of
face
there
came
into
head
the
curious
problem
whether
he
was
to
be
regarded
as
a
nuisance
haunting
these
people
or
whether
they
were
to
be
regarded
as
a
nuisance
haunting
him
he
abandoned
the
solution
at
last
in
despair
quite
unable
to
decide
upon
the
course
he
should
take
at
the
next
encounter
whether
he
should
scowl
savagely
at
the
couple
or
assume
an
attitude
eloquent
of
apology
and
propitiation
x
the
imaginings
of
heart
hoopdriver
was
in
the
days
of
this
story
a
poet
though
he
had
never
written
a
line
of
verse
or
perhaps
romancer
will
describe
him
better
like
i
know
not
how
many
of
those
who
do
the
fetching
and
carrying
of
life
a
great
number
of
them
certainly
his
real
life
was
absolutely
uninteresting
and
if
he
had
faced
it
as
realistically
as
such
people
do
in
novels
he
would
probably
have
come
by
way
of
drink
to
suicide
in
the
course
of
a
year
but
that
was
just
what
he
had
the
natural
wisdom
not
to
do
on
the
contrary
he
was
always
decorating
his
existence
with
imaginative
tags
hopes
and
poses
deliberate
and
yet
quite
effectual
his
experiences
were
mere
material
for
a
romantic
superstructure
if
some
power
had
given
hoopdriver
the
burns
invoked
see
oursels
as
ithers
see
us
he
would
probably
have
given
it
away
to
some
one
else
at
the
very
earliest
opportunity
his
entire
life
you
must
understand
was
not
a
continuous
romance
but
a
series
of
short
stories
linked
only
by
the
general
resemblance
of
their
hero
a
young
fellow
commonly
with
blue
eyes
and
a
fair
moustache
graceful
rather
than
strong
sharp
and
resolute
rather
than
clever
as
the
scientific
books
say
invariably
this
person
possessed
an
iron
will
the
stories
fluctuated
indefinitely
the
smoking
of
a
cigarette
converted
hero
into
something
entirely
worldly
subtly
rakish
with
a
humorous
twinkle
in
the
eye
and
some
gallant
sinning
in
the
background
you
should
have
seen
hoopdriver
promenading
the
brilliant
gardens
at
court
on
an
night
his
meaning
glances
i
dare
not
give
the
meaning
such
an
influence
as
the
eloquence
of
a
revivalist
preacher
would
suffice
to
divert
the
story
into
absolutely
different
channels
make
him
a
hero
a
man
still
pure
walking
untainted
and
brave
and
helpful
through
miry
ways
the
appearance
of
some
daintily
gloved
frockcoated
gentleman
with
buttonhole
and
eyeglass
complete
gallantly
attendant
in
the
rear
of
customers
served
again
to
start
visions
of
a
simplicity
essentially
of
sturdy
plainness
of
a
strong
silent
man
going
righteously
through
the
world
this
day
there
had
predominated
a
fine
leisurely
person
immaculately
clothed
and
riding
on
an
unexceptional
machine
a
mysterious
person
quite
unostentatious
but
with
accidental
of
something
over
the
common
even
a
dook
it
might
be
incognito
on
the
tour
of
the
south
coast
you
must
not
think
that
there
was
any
telling
of
these
stories
of
this
series
by
hoopdriver
he
never
dreamt
that
they
were
known
to
a
soul
if
it
were
not
for
the
trouble
i
would
i
think
go
back
and
rewrite
this
section
from
the
beginning
expunging
the
statements
that
hoopdriver
was
a
poet
and
a
romancer
and
saying
instead
that
he
was
a
playwright
and
acted
his
own
plays
he
was
not
only
the
sole
performer
but
the
entire
audience
and
the
entertainment
kept
him
almost
continuously
happy
yet
even
that
playwright
comparison
scarcely
expresses
all
the
facts
of
the
case
after
all
very
many
of
his
dreams
never
got
acted
at
all
possibly
indeed
most
of
them
the
dreams
of
a
solitary
walk
for
instance
or
of
a
tramcar
ride
the
dreams
dreamt
behind
the
counter
while
trade
was
slack
and
mechanical
foldings
and
rollings
occupied
his
muscles
most
of
them
were
little
dramatic
situations
crucial
dialogues
the
return
of
hoopdriver
to
his
native
village
for
instance
in
a
holiday
suit
and
natty
gloves
the
unheard
asides
of
the
rival
neighbours
the
delight
of
the
old
the
intelligence
rise
all
at
once
from
antrobus
mater
whad
think
of
that
or
again
the
first
whispering
of
love
dainty
and
witty
and
tender
to
the
girl
he
served
a
few
days
ago
with
sateen
or
a
gallant
rescue
of
generalised
beauty
in
distress
from
truculent
insult
or
ravening
dog
so
many
people
do
this
and
you
never
suspect
it
you
see
a
tattered
lad
selling
matches
in
the
street
and
you
think
there
is
nothing
between
him
and
the
bleakness
of
immensity
between
him
and
utter
abasement
but
a
few
tattered
rags
and
a
feeble
musculature
and
all
unseen
by
you
a
host
of
fatuities
swathes
him
about
even
maybe
as
they
swathe
you
about
many
men
have
never
seen
their
own
profiles
or
the
backs
of
their
heads
and
for
the
back
of
your
own
mind
no
mirror
has
been
invented
they
swathe
him
about
so
thickly
that
the
pricks
of
fate
scarce
penetrate
to
him
or
become
but
a
pleasant
titillation
and
so
indeed
it
is
with
all
of
us
who
go
on
living
is
the
anaesthetic
of
life
while
god
is
carving
out
our
beings
but
to
return
from
this
general
vivisection
to
imaginings
you
see
now
how
external
our
view
has
been
we
have
had
but
the
slightest
transitory
glimpses
of
the
drama
within
of
how
the
things
looked
in
the
magic
mirror
of
mind
on
the
road
to
guildford
and
during
his
encounters
with
his
haunting
the
drama
had
presented
chiefly
the
quiet
gentleman
to
whom
we
have
alluded
but
at
guildford
under
more
varied
stimuli
he
burgeoned
out
more
variously
there
was
the
house
window
for
instance
set
him
upon
a
charming
little
comedy
he
would
go
in
make
inquires
about
that
house
get
the
key
possibly
and
go
over
it
the
thing
would
stimulate
the
curiosity
immensely
he
searched
his
mind
for
a
reason
for
this
proceeding
and
discovered
that
he
was
a
dynamiter
needing
privacy
upon
that
theory
he
procured
the
key
explored
the
house
carefully
said
darkly
that
it
might
suit
his
special
needs
but
that
there
were
others
to
consult
the
clerk
however
did
not
understand
the
allusion
and
merely
pitied
him
as
one
who
had
married
young
and
paired
himself
to
a
stronger
mind
than
his
own
this
proceeding
in
some
occult
way
led
to
the
purchase
of
a
and
pencil
and
that
started
the
conception
of
an
artist
taking
notes
that
was
a
little
game
hoopdriver
had
in
congenial
company
played
in
his
still
younger
days
to
the
infinite
annoyance
of
quite
a
number
of
respectable
excursionists
at
hastings
in
early
days
hoopdriver
had
been
as
his
mother
proudly
boasted
a
of
a
drawer
but
a
conscientious
and
normally
stupid
schoolmaster
perceived
the
incipient
talent
and
had
nipped
it
in
the
bud
by
a
series
of
lessons
in
art
however
our
principal
character
figured
about
quite
happily
in
old
corners
of
guildford
and
once
the
other
man
in
brown
looking
out
of
the
bay
window
of
the
earl
of
kent
saw
him
standing
in
a
corner
by
a
gateway
in
hand
busily
sketching
the
imposing
features
at
which
sight
the
other
man
in
brown
started
back
from
the
centre
of
the
window
so
as
to
be
hidden
from
him
and
crouching
slightly
watched
him
intently
through
the
interstices
of
the
lace
curtains
xi
omissions
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
hoopdriver
in
guildford
on
the
great
opening
day
of
his
holidays
are
not
to
be
detailed
here
how
he
wandered
about
the
old
town
in
the
dusk
and
up
to
the
hogsback
to
see
the
little
lamps
below
and
the
little
stars
above
come
out
one
after
another
how
he
returned
through
the
streets
to
the
yellow
hammer
coffee
tavern
and
supped
bravely
in
the
commercial
room
a
man
among
men
how
he
joined
in
the
talk
about
and
the
possibilities
of
electricity
witnessing
that
were
certain
to
come
and
that
electricity
was
how
he
went
and
watched
the
billiard
playing
and
said
several
times
with
an
oracular
air
how
he
fell
and
how
he
got
out
his
cycling
map
and
studied
it
intently
are
things
that
find
no
mention
here
nor
will
i
enlarge
upon
his
going
into
the
and
marking
the
road
from
london
to
guildford
with
a
fine
bright
line
of
the
reddest
of
red
ink
in
his
little
cyclist
there
is
a
diary
and
in
the
diary
there
is
an
entry
of
these
things
it
is
there
to
this
day
and
i
can
not
do
better
than
reproduce
it
here
to
witness
that
this
book
is
indeed
a
true
one
and
no
lying
fable
written
to
while
away
an
hour
at
last
he
fell
so
much
that
very
reluctantly
indeed
he
set
about
finishing
this
great
and
splendid
day
alas
that
all
days
must
end
at
last
he
got
his
candle
in
the
hall
from
a
friendly
and
passed
upward
whither
a
modest
novelist
who
writes
for
the
family
circle
dare
not
follow
yet
i
may
tell
you
that
he
knelt
down
at
his
bedside
happy
and
drowsy
and
said
father
heaven
even
as
he
had
learnt
it
by
rote
from
his
mother
nearly
twenty
years
ago
and
anon
when
his
breathing
had
become
deep
and
regular
we
may
creep
into
his
bedroom
and
catch
him
at
his
dreams
he
is
lying
upon
his
left
side
with
his
arm
under
the
pillow
it
is
dark
and
he
is
hidden
but
if
you
could
have
seen
his
face
sleeping
there
in
the
darkness
i
think
you
would
have
perceived
in
spite
of
that
treasured
thin
and
straggling
moustache
in
spite
of
your
memory
of
the
coarse
words
he
had
used
that
day
that
the
man
before
you
was
after
all
only
a
little
child
asleep
xii
the
dreams
of
hoopdriver
in
spite
of
the
drawn
blinds
and
the
darkness
you
have
just
seen
face
peaceful
in
its
beauty
sleep
in
the
little
plain
bedroom
at
the
very
top
of
the
yellow
hammer
coffee
tavern
at
guildford
that
was
before
midnight
as
the
night
progressed
he
was
disturbed
by
dreams
after
your
first
day
of
cycling
one
dream
is
inevitable
a
memory
of
motion
lingers
in
the
muscles
of
your
legs
and
round
and
round
they
seem
to
go
you
ride
through
dreamland
on
wonderful
dream
bicycles
that
change
and
grow
you
ride
down
steeples
and
staircases
and
over
precipices
you
hover
in
horrible
suspense
over
inhabited
towns
vainly
seeking
for
a
brake
your
hand
can
not
find
to
save
you
from
a
headlong
fall
you
plunge
into
weltering
rivers
and
rush
helplessly
at
monstrous
obstacles
anon
hoopdriver
found
himself
riding
out
of
the
darkness
of
pedalling
wheels
across
the
weald
of
surrey
jolting
over
the
hills
and
smashing
villages
in
his
course
while
the
other
man
in
brown
cursed
and
swore
at
him
and
shouted
to
stop
his
career
there
was
the
putney
too
and
the
man
in
drab
raging
at
him
he
felt
an
awful
fool
a
what
was
it
a
juggins
ah
a
juggernaut
the
villages
went
off
one
after
another
with
a
soft
squashing
noise
he
did
not
see
the
young
lady
in
grey
but
he
knew
she
was
looking
at
his
back
he
dared
not
look
round
where
the
devil
was
the
brake
it
must
have
fallen
off
and
the
bell
right
in
front
of
him
was
guildford
he
tried
to
shout
and
warn
the
town
to
get
out
of
the
way
but
his
voice
was
gone
as
well
nearer
nearer
it
was
fearful
and
in
another
moment
the
houses
were
cracking
like
nuts
and
the
blood
of
the
inhabitants
squirting
this
way
and
that
the
streets
were
black
with
people
running
right
under
his
wheels
he
saw
the
young
lady
in
grey
a
feeling
of
horror
came
upon
hoopdriver
he
flung
himself
sideways
to
descend
forgetting
how
high
he
was
and
forthwith
he
began
falling
falling
falling
he
woke
up
turned
over
saw
the
new
moon
on
the
window
wondered
a
little
and
went
to
sleep
again
this
second
dream
went
back
into
the
first
somehow
and
the
other
man
in
brown
came
threatening
and
shouting
towards
him
he
grew
uglier
and
uglier
as
he
approached
and
his
expression
was
intolerably
evil
he
came
and
looked
close
into
eyes
and
then
receded
to
an
incredible
distance
his
face
seemed
to
be
luminous
beaumont
he
said
and
splashed
up
a
spray
of
suspicion
some
one
began
letting
off
fireworks
chiefly
catherine
wheels
down
the
shop
though
hoopdriver
knew
it
was
against
the
rules
for
it
seemed
that
the
place
they
were
in
was
a
vast
shop
and
then
hoopdriver
perceived
that
the
other
man
in
brown
was
the
differing
from
most
in
the
fact
that
he
was
lit
from
within
as
a
chinese
lantern
might
be
and
the
customer
hoopdriver
was
going
to
serve
was
the
young
lady
in
grey
curious
he
noticed
it
before
she
was
in
grey
as
usual
rationals
and
she
had
her
bicycle
leaning
against
the
counter
she
smiled
quite
frankly
at
him
just
as
she
had
done
when
she
had
apologised
for
stopping
him
and
her
form
as
she
leant
towards
him
was
full
of
a
sinuous
grace
he
had
never
noticed
before
can
i
have
the
pleasure
said
hoopdriver
at
once
and
she
said
ripley
so
he
got
out
the
ripley
road
and
unrolled
it
and
showed
it
to
her
and
she
said
that
would
do
very
nicely
and
kept
on
looking
at
him
and
smiling
and
he
began
measuring
off
eight
miles
by
means
of
the
yard
measure
on
the
counter
eight
miles
being
a
dress
length
a
rational
dress
length
that
is
and
then
the
other
man
in
brown
came
up
and
wanted
to
interfere
and
said
hoopdriver
was
a
cad
besides
measuring
it
off
too
slowly
and
as
hoopdriver
began
to
measure
faster
the
other
man
in
brown
said
the
young
lady
in
grey
had
been
there
long
enough
and
that
he
was
her
brother
or
else
she
would
not
be
travelling
with
him
and
he
suddenly
whipped
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
made
off
with
her
it
occurred
to
hoopdriver
even
at
the
moment
that
this
was
scarcely
brotherly
behaviour
of
course
it
the
sight
of
the
other
man
gripping
her
so
familiarly
enraged
him
frightfully
he
leapt
over
the
counter
forthwith
and
gave
chase
they
ran
round
the
shop
and
up
an
iron
staircase
into
the
keep
and
so
out
upon
the
ripley
road
for
some
time
they
kept
dodging
in
and
out
of
a
wayside
hotel
with
two
front
doors
and
an
inn
yard
the
other
man
could
not
run
very
fast
because
he
had
hold
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
but
hoopdriver
was
hampered
by
the
absurd
behaviour
of
his
legs
they
would
not
stretch
out
they
would
keep
going
round
and
round
as
if
they
were
on
the
treadles
of
a
wheel
so
that
he
made
the
smallest
steps
conceivable
this
dream
came
to
no
crisis
the
chase
seemed
to
last
an
interminable
time
and
all
kinds
of
people
heathkeepers
shopmen
policemen
the
old
man
in
the
keep
the
angry
man
in
drab
the
barmaid
at
the
unicorn
men
with
people
playing
billiards
in
the
doorways
silly
headless
figures
stupid
cocks
and
hens
encumbered
with
parcels
and
umbrellas
and
waterproofs
people
carrying
bedroom
candles
and
riffraff
kept
getting
in
his
way
and
annoying
him
although
he
sounded
his
electric
bell
and
said
wonderful
at
every
corner
xiii
how
hoopdriver
went
to
haslemere
there
was
some
little
delay
in
getting
breakfast
so
that
after
all
he
was
not
free
to
start
out
of
guildford
until
just
upon
the
stroke
of
nine
he
wheeled
his
machine
from
the
high
street
in
some
perplexity
he
did
not
know
whether
this
young
lady
who
had
seized
hold
of
his
imagination
so
strongly
and
her
unfriendly
and
possibly
menacing
brother
were
ahead
of
him
or
even
now
breakfasting
somewhere
in
guildford
in
the
former
case
he
might
loiter
as
he
chose
in
the
latter
he
must
hurry
and
possibly
take
refuge
in
branch
roads
it
occurred
to
him
as
being
in
some
obscure
way
strategic
that
he
would
leave
guildford
not
by
the
obvious
portsmouth
road
but
by
the
road
running
through
shalford
along
this
pleasant
shady
way
he
felt
sufficiently
secure
to
resume
his
exercises
in
riding
with
one
hand
off
the
handles
and
in
staring
over
his
shoulder
he
came
over
once
or
twice
but
fell
on
his
foot
each
time
and
perceived
that
he
was
improving
before
he
got
to
bramley
a
specious
byway
snapped
him
up
ran
with
him
for
half
a
mile
or
more
and
dropped
him
as
a
terrier
drops
a
walkingstick
upon
the
portsmouth
again
a
couple
of
miles
from
godalming
he
entered
godalming
on
his
feet
for
the
road
through
that
delightful
town
is
beyond
dispute
the
vilest
in
the
world
a
mere
tumult
of
road
metal
a
way
of
peaks
and
precipices
and
after
a
successful
experiment
with
cider
at
the
woolpack
he
pushed
on
to
milford
all
this
time
he
was
acutely
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
and
her
companion
in
brown
as
a
child
in
the
dark
is
of
bogies
sometimes
he
could
hear
their
pneumatics
stealing
upon
him
from
behind
and
looking
round
saw
a
long
stretch
of
vacant
road
once
he
saw
far
ahead
of
him
a
glittering
wheel
but
it
proved
to
be
a
workingman
riding
to
destruction
on
a
very
tall
ordinary
and
he
felt
a
curious
vague
uneasiness
about
that
young
lady
in
grey
for
which
he
was
altogether
unable
to
account
now
that
he
was
awake
he
had
forgotten
that
accentuated
miss
beaumont
that
had
been
quite
clear
in
his
dream
but
the
curious
dream
conviction
that
the
girl
was
not
really
the
sister
would
not
let
itself
be
forgotten
why
for
instance
should
a
man
want
to
be
alone
with
his
sister
on
the
top
of
a
tower
at
milford
his
bicycle
made
so
to
speak
an
ass
of
itself
a
suddenly
jumped
out
at
him
vainly
indicating
an
abrupt
turn
to
the
right
and
hoopdriver
would
have
slowed
up
and
read
the
inscription
but
no
the
bicycle
would
not
let
him
the
road
dropped
a
little
into
milford
and
the
thing
shied
put
down
its
head
and
bolted
and
hoopdriver
only
thought
of
the
brake
when
the
fingerpost
was
passed
then
to
have
recovered
the
point
of
intersection
would
have
meant
dismounting
for
as
yet
there
was
no
road
wide
enough
for
hoopdriver
to
turn
in
so
he
went
on
his
way
or
to
be
precise
he
did
exactly
the
opposite
thing
the
road
to
the
right
was
the
portsmouth
road
and
this
he
was
on
went
to
haslemere
and
midhurst
by
that
error
it
came
about
that
he
once
more
came
upon
his
fellow
travellers
of
yesterday
coming
on
them
suddenly
without
the
slightest
preliminary
announcement
and
when
they
least
expected
it
under
the
southwestern
railway
arch
horrible
said
a
girlish
voice
brutal
cowardly
and
stopped
his
expression
as
he
shot
out
from
the
archway
at
them
may
have
been
something
between
a
grin
of
recognition
and
a
scowl
of
annoyance
at
himself
for
the
unintentional
intrusion
but
disconcerted
as
he
was
he
was
yet
able
to
appreciate
something
of
the
peculiarity
of
their
mutual
attitudes
the
bicycles
were
lying
by
the
roadside
and
the
two
riders
stood
face
to
face
the
other
man
in
attitude
as
it
flashed
upon
hoopdriver
was
a
deliberate
pose
he
twirled
his
moustache
and
smiled
faintly
and
he
was
conscientiously
looking
amused
and
the
girl
stood
rigid
her
arms
straight
by
her
side
her
handkerchief
clenched
in
her
hand
and
her
face
was
flushed
with
the
faintest
touch
of
red
upon
her
eyelids
she
seemed
to
sense
to
be
indignant
but
that
was
the
impression
of
a
second
a
mask
of
surprised
recognition
fell
across
this
revelation
of
emotion
as
she
turned
her
head
towards
him
and
the
pose
of
the
other
man
in
brown
vanished
too
in
a
momentary
astonishment
and
then
he
had
passed
them
and
was
riding
on
towards
haslemere
to
make
what
he
could
of
the
swift
picture
that
had
photographed
itself
on
his
brain
said
hoopdriver
dashed
rum
were
having
a
what
he
called
the
other
man
in
brown
need
not
trouble
us
her
that
any
human
being
should
do
that
the
impulse
to
interfere
leapt
suddenly
into
mind
he
grasped
his
brake
descended
and
stood
looking
hesitatingly
back
they
still
stood
by
the
railway
bridge
and
it
seemed
to
fancy
that
she
was
stamping
her
foot
he
hesitated
then
turned
his
bicycle
round
mounted
and
rode
back
towards
them
gripping
his
courage
firmly
lest
it
should
slip
away
and
leave
him
ridiculous
offer
a
screw
said
hoopdriver
then
with
a
wave
of
fierce
emotion
he
saw
that
the
girl
was
crying
in
another
moment
they
heard
him
and
turned
in
surprise
certainly
she
had
been
crying
her
eyes
were
swimming
in
tears
and
the
other
man
in
brown
looked
exceedingly
disconcerted
hoopdriver
descended
and
stood
over
his
machine
wrong
i
hope
he
said
looking
the
other
man
in
brown
squarely
in
the
face
accident
said
the
other
man
in
brown
shortly
at
all
said
hoopdriver
with
a
great
effort
young
lady
is
crying
i
thought
perhaps
the
young
lady
in
grey
started
gave
hoopdriver
one
swift
glance
and
covered
one
eye
with
her
handkerchief
this
speck
she
said
speck
of
dust
in
my
lady
said
the
other
man
in
brown
explaining
a
gnat
in
her
there
was
a
pause
the
young
lady
busied
herself
with
her
eye
believe
out
she
said
the
other
man
in
brown
made
movements
indicating
commiserating
curiosity
concerning
the
alleged
fly
hoopdriver
the
word
is
his
own
stood
he
had
all
the
intuition
of
the
he
knew
there
was
no
fly
but
the
ground
was
suddenly
cut
from
his
feet
there
is
a
limit
to
knighterrantry
dragons
and
false
knights
are
all
very
well
but
flies
fictitious
flies
whatever
the
trouble
was
it
was
evidently
not
his
affair
he
felt
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
again
he
would
have
mumbled
some
sort
of
apology
but
the
other
man
in
brown
gave
him
no
time
turned
on
him
abruptly
even
fiercely
hope
he
said
your
curiosity
is
satisfied
said
hoopdriver
we
detain
and
ignominiously
hoopdriver
turned
his
machine
about
struggled
upon
it
and
resumed
the
road
southward
and
when
he
learnt
that
he
was
not
on
the
portsmouth
road
it
was
impossible
to
turn
and
go
back
for
that
would
be
to
face
his
shame
again
and
so
he
had
to
ride
on
by
brook
street
up
the
hill
to
haslemere
and
away
to
the
right
the
portsmouth
road
mocked
at
him
and
made
off
to
its
fastnesses
amid
the
sunlit
green
and
purple
masses
of
hindhead
where
grant
allen
writes
his
hill
top
novels
day
by
day
the
sun
shone
and
the
wide
blue
hill
views
and
pleasant
valleys
one
saw
on
either
hand
from
the
sandscarred
roadway
even
the
sides
of
the
road
itself
set
about
with
grey
heather
scrub
and
prickly
masses
of
gorse
and
pine
trees
with
their
growth
still
bright
green
against
the
darkened
needles
of
the
previous
years
were
fresh
and
delightful
to
eyes
but
the
brightness
of
the
day
and
the
sense
of
freedom
fought
an
uphill
fight
against
his
intolerable
vexation
at
that
abominable
encounter
and
had
still
to
win
it
when
he
reached
haslemere
a
great
brown
shadow
a
monstrous
hatred
of
the
other
man
in
brown
possessed
him
he
had
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
abandoning
portsmouth
or
at
least
giving
up
the
straight
way
to
his
and
of
striking
out
boldly
to
the
left
eastward
he
did
not
dare
to
stop
at
any
of
the
inviting
in
the
main
street
of
haslemere
but
turned
up
a
side
way
and
found
a
little
the
good
hope
wherein
to
refresh
himself
and
there
he
ate
and
gossipped
condescendingly
with
an
aged
labourer
assuming
the
while
for
his
own
private
enjoyment
the
attributes
of
a
lost
heir
and
afterwards
mounted
and
rode
on
towards
northchapel
a
place
which
a
number
of
conspired
to
boom
but
which
some
insidious
turning
prevented
him
from
attaining
xiv
how
hoopdriver
reached
midhurst
it
was
one
of
my
profoundest
remarks
that
human
beings
are
the
only
unreasonable
creatures
this
observation
was
so
far
justified
by
hoopdriver
that
after
spending
the
morning
tortuously
avoiding
the
other
man
in
brown
and
the
young
lady
in
grey
he
spent
a
considerable
part
of
the
afternoon
in
thinking
about
the
young
lady
in
grey
and
contemplating
in
an
optimistic
spirit
the
possibilities
of
seeing
her
again
memory
and
imagination
played
round
her
so
that
his
course
was
largely
determined
by
the
windings
of
the
road
he
traversed
of
one
general
proposition
he
was
absolutely
convinced
something
juicy
wrong
with
said
he
once
even
aloud
but
what
it
was
he
could
not
imagine
he
recapitulated
the
facts
beaumont
brother
and
sister
and
the
stoppage
to
quarrel
and
weep
it
was
perplexing
material
for
a
young
man
of
small
experience
there
was
no
exertion
he
hated
so
much
as
inference
and
after
a
time
he
gave
up
any
attempt
to
get
at
the
realities
of
the
case
and
let
his
imagination
go
free
should
he
ever
see
her
again
suppose
he
did
with
that
other
chap
not
about
the
vision
he
found
pleasantest
was
an
encounter
with
her
an
unexpected
encounter
at
the
annual
dancing
class
at
the
putney
assembly
rooms
somehow
they
would
drift
together
and
he
would
dance
with
her
again
and
again
it
was
a
pleasant
vision
for
you
must
understand
that
hoopdriver
danced
uncommonly
well
or
again
in
the
shop
a
sudden
radiance
in
the
doorway
and
she
is
bowed
towards
the
manchester
counter
and
then
to
lean
over
that
counter
and
murmur
seemingly
apropos
of
the
goods
under
discussion
have
not
forgotten
that
morning
on
the
portsmouth
road
and
lower
never
shall
at
northchapel
hoopdriver
consulted
his
map
and
took
counsel
and
weighed
his
course
of
action
petworth
seemed
a
possible
or
pullborough
midhurst
seemed
too
near
and
any
place
over
the
downs
beyond
too
far
and
so
he
meandered
towards
petworth
posing
himself
perpetually
and
loitering
gathering
wild
flowers
and
wondering
why
they
had
no
names
for
he
had
never
heard
of
any
dropping
them
furtively
at
the
sight
of
a
stranger
and
generally
there
were
purple
vetches
in
the
hedges
meadowsweet
honeysuckle
belated
brambles
but
the
had
already
gone
there
were
green
and
red
blackberries
stellarias
and
dandelions
and
in
another
place
white
dead
nettles
clinging
bedstraw
grasses
flowering
white
campions
and
ragged
robins
one
cornfield
was
glorious
with
poppies
bright
scarlet
and
purple
white
and
the
blue
were
beginning
in
the
lanes
the
trees
met
overhead
and
the
wisps
of
hay
still
hung
to
the
straggling
hedges
iri
one
of
the
main
roads
he
steered
a
perilous
passage
through
a
dozen
surly
dun
oxen
here
and
there
were
little
cottages
and
picturesque
with
the
vivid
boards
of
blue
and
scarlet
and
once
a
broad
green
and
a
church
and
an
expanse
of
some
hundred
houses
or
so
then
he
came
to
a
pebbly
rivulet
that
emerged
between
clumps
of
sedge
loosestrife
and
under
an
arch
of
trees
and
rippled
across
the
road
and
there
he
dismounted
longing
to
take
off
shoes
and
stockings
those
stylish
chequered
stockings
were
now
all
dimmed
with
dust
and
paddle
his
lean
legs
in
the
chuckling
cheerful
water
but
instead
he
sat
in
a
manly
attitude
smoking
a
cigarette
for
fear
lest
the
young
lady
in
grey
should
come
glittering
round
the
corner
for
the
flavour
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
was
present
through
it
all
mixing
with
the
flowers
and
all
the
delight
of
it
a
touch
that
made
this
second
day
quite
different
from
the
first
an
undertone
of
expectation
anxiety
and
something
like
regret
that
would
not
be
ignored
it
was
only
late
in
the
long
evening
that
quite
abruptly
he
began
to
repent
vividly
and
decidedly
having
fled
these
two
people
he
was
getting
hungry
and
that
has
a
curious
effect
upon
the
emotional
colouring
of
our
minds
the
man
was
a
sinister
brute
hoopdriver
saw
in
a
flash
of
inspiration
and
the
girl
she
was
in
some
serious
trouble
and
he
who
might
have
helped
her
had
taken
his
first
impulse
as
decisive
and
bolted
this
new
view
of
it
depressed
him
dreadfully
what
might
not
be
happening
to
her
now
he
thought
again
of
her
tears
surely
it
was
merely
his
duty
seeing
the
trouble
afoot
to
keep
his
eye
upon
it
he
began
riding
fast
to
get
quit
of
such
selfreproaches
he
found
himself
in
a
tortuous
tangle
of
roads
and
as
the
dusk
was
coming
on
emerged
not
at
petworth
but
at
easebourne
a
mile
from
midhurst
getting
hungry
said
hoopdriver
inquiring
of
a
gamekeeper
in
easebourne
village
a
mile
and
petworth
five
thenks
take
he
came
into
midhurst
by
the
bridge
at
the
watermill
and
up
the
north
street
and
a
little
shop
flourishing
cheerfully
the
cheerful
sign
of
a
teapot
and
exhibiting
a
brilliant
array
of
tobaccos
sweets
and
toys
in
the
window
struck
his
fancy
a
neat
little
old
lady
made
him
welcome
and
he
was
presently
supping
sumptuously
on
sausages
and
tea
with
a
book
full
of
the
most
humorous
and
flattering
remarks
about
the
little
old
lady
in
verse
and
prose
propped
up
against
his
teapot
as
he
ate
regular
good
some
of
the
jokes
were
and
rhymes
that
read
well
even
with
your
mouth
full
of
sausage
hoopdriver
formed
a
vague
idea
of
drawing
for
his
judgment
on
the
little
old
lady
was
already
formed
he
pictured
the
little
old
lady
discovering
it
afterwards
gracious
one
of
them
punch
men
she
would
say
the
room
had
a
curtained
recess
and
a
chest
of
drawers
for
presently
it
was
to
be
his
bedroom
and
the
day
part
of
it
was
decorated
with
framed
certificates
and
giltbacked
books
and
portraits
and
and
all
kinds
of
beautiful
things
made
out
of
wool
very
comfortable
it
was
indeed
the
window
was
lead
framed
and
diamond
paned
and
through
it
one
saw
the
corner
of
the
vicarage
and
a
pleasant
hill
crest
in
dusky
silhouette
against
the
twilight
sky
and
after
the
sausages
had
ceased
to
be
he
lit
a
red
herring
cigarette
and
went
swaggering
out
into
the
twilight
street
all
shadowy
blue
between
its
dark
brick
houses
was
the
street
with
a
bright
yellow
window
here
and
there
and
splashes
of
green
and
red
where
the
illumination
fell
across
the
road
xv
an
interlude
and
now
let
us
for
a
space
leave
hoopdriver
in
the
dusky
midhurst
north
street
and
return
to
the
two
folks
beside
the
railway
bridge
between
milford
and
haslemere
she
was
a
girl
of
eighteen
dark
fine
featured
with
bright
eyes
and
a
rich
swift
colour
under
her
skin
her
eyes
were
all
the
brighter
for
the
tears
that
swam
in
them
the
man
was
thirty
three
or
four
fair
with
a
longish
nose
overhanging
his
sandy
flaxen
moustache
pale
blue
eyes
and
a
head
that
struck
out
above
and
behind
he
stood
with
his
feet
wide
apart
his
hand
on
his
hip
in
an
attitude
that
was
equally
suggestive
of
defiance
and
aggression
they
had
watched
hoopdriver
out
of
sight
the
unexpected
interruption
had
stopped
the
flood
of
her
tears
he
tugged
his
abundant
moustache
and
regarded
her
calmly
she
stood
with
face
averted
obstinately
resolved
not
to
speak
first
behaviour
he
said
at
last
you
she
turned
upon
him
her
eyes
and
cheeks
glowing
her
hands
clenched
unspeakable
cad
she
said
and
choked
stamped
her
little
foot
and
stood
panting
cad
my
dear
girl
possible
i
am
an
unspeakable
cad
who
be
for
you
girl
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
like
that
you
would
do
anything
there
was
a
pause
she
looked
squarely
into
his
face
her
eyes
alight
with
anger
and
contempt
and
perhaps
he
flushed
a
little
he
stroked
his
moustache
and
by
an
effort
maintained
his
cynical
calm
us
be
reasonable
he
said
that
means
all
that
is
mean
and
cowardly
and
sensual
in
the
have
always
had
it
so
in
your
generalising
way
but
let
us
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
if
that
pleases
you
with
an
impatient
gesture
she
motioned
him
to
go
on
he
said
left
my
home
she
corrected
with
dignity
left
my
home
because
it
was
unendurable
because
that
woman
yes
but
the
point
is
you
have
eloped
with
came
with
me
you
pretended
to
be
my
friend
promised
to
help
me
to
earn
a
living
by
writing
it
was
you
who
said
why
a
man
and
woman
be
friends
and
now
you
dare
you
dare
jessie
this
pose
of
yours
this
injured
innocence
will
go
back
i
forbid
you
i
forbid
you
to
stand
in
the
way
moment
i
have
always
thought
that
my
little
pupil
was
at
least
you
know
everything
yet
you
know
listen
to
me
for
a
i
been
listening
and
you
have
only
insulted
me
you
who
dared
only
to
talk
of
friendship
who
scarcely
dared
hint
at
anything
you
took
the
hints
nevertheless
you
knew
you
knew
and
you
did
not
mind
mind
you
liked
it
it
was
the
fun
of
the
whole
thing
for
you
that
i
loved
you
and
could
not
speak
to
you
you
played
with
it
have
said
all
that
before
do
you
think
that
justifies
you
all
i
made
up
my
mind
well
to
make
the
game
more
even
and
so
i
suggested
to
you
and
joined
with
you
in
this
expedition
of
yours
invented
a
sister
at
midhurst
i
tell
you
i
a
sister
for
one
object
compromise
she
started
that
was
a
new
way
of
putting
it
for
half
a
minute
neither
spoke
then
she
began
half
defiantly
i
am
compromised
of
course
i
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
dear
girl
you
are
still
on
the
sunny
side
of
eighteen
and
you
know
very
little
of
this
world
less
than
you
think
but
you
will
learn
before
you
write
all
those
novels
we
have
talked
about
you
will
have
to
learn
and
one
point
he
hesitated
started
and
blushed
when
the
man
at
breakfast
called
you
you
thought
it
a
funny
mistake
but
you
did
not
say
anything
because
he
was
young
and
nervous
and
besides
the
thought
of
being
my
wife
offended
your
modesty
you
care
to
notice
it
but
you
see
i
gave
your
name
as
he
looked
almost
apologetic
in
spite
of
his
cynical
pose
beaumont
he
repeated
pulling
his
flaxen
moustache
and
watching
the
effect
she
looked
into
his
eyes
speechless
am
learning
fast
she
said
slowly
at
last
he
thought
the
time
had
come
for
an
emotional
attack
he
said
with
a
sudden
change
of
voice
know
all
this
is
mean
isvillanous
but
do
you
think
that
i
have
done
all
this
scheming
all
this
subterfuge
for
any
other
object
she
did
not
seem
to
listen
to
his
words
shall
ride
home
she
said
abruptly
her
she
winced
think
said
he
she
could
say
to
you
after
i
shall
leave
you
and
go
somewhere
to
earn
my
living
to
be
a
free
woman
to
live
without
conventionality
dear
girl
do
let
us
be
cynical
you
money
and
you
credit
no
one
would
take
you
in
one
of
two
things
go
back
to
your
stepmother
or
trust
to
can
i
you
must
go
back
to
he
paused
momentarily
to
let
this
consideration
have
its
proper
weight
i
did
not
mean
to
say
the
things
i
did
upon
my
honour
i
lost
my
head
when
i
spoke
so
if
you
will
forgive
me
i
am
a
man
i
could
not
help
myself
forgive
me
and
i
promise
you
can
i
trust
you
me
i
can
assure
you
she
regarded
him
distrustfully
any
rate
ride
on
with
me
now
surely
we
have
been
in
the
shadow
of
this
horrible
bridge
long
let
me
think
she
said
half
turning
from
him
and
pressing
her
hand
to
her
brow
look
here
jessie
it
is
ten
shall
we
call
a
truce
until
one
she
hesitated
demanded
a
definition
of
the
truce
and
at
last
agreed
they
mounted
and
rode
on
in
silence
through
the
sunlight
and
the
heather
both
were
extremely
uncomfortable
and
disappointed
she
was
pale
divided
between
fear
and
anger
she
perceived
she
was
in
a
scrape
and
tried
in
vain
to
think
of
a
way
of
escape
only
one
tangible
thing
would
keep
in
her
mind
try
as
she
would
to
ignore
it
that
was
the
quite
irrelevant
fact
that
his
head
was
singularly
like
an
albino
cocoanut
he
too
felt
thwarted
he
felt
that
this
romantic
business
of
seduction
was
after
all
unexpectedly
tame
but
this
was
only
the
beginning
at
any
rate
every
day
she
spent
with
him
was
a
day
gained
perhaps
things
looked
worse
than
they
were
that
was
some
consolation
xvi
of
the
artificial
in
man
and
of
the
zeitgeist
you
have
seen
these
two
young
people
bechamel
is
the
name
and
the
is
jessie
milton
from
the
outside
you
have
heard
them
talking
they
ride
now
side
by
side
but
not
too
close
together
and
in
an
uneasy
silence
towards
haslemere
and
this
chapter
will
concern
itself
with
those
curious
little
council
chambers
inside
their
skulls
where
their
motives
are
in
session
and
their
acts
are
considered
and
passed
but
first
a
word
concerning
wigs
and
false
teeth
some
jester
enlarging
upon
the
increase
of
bald
heads
and
purblind
people
has
deduced
a
wonderful
future
for
the
children
of
men
man
he
said
was
nowadays
a
hairless
creature
by
forty
or
fifty
and
for
hair
we
gave
him
a
wig
shrivelled
and
we
padded
him
toothless
and
lo
false
teeth
set
in
gold
did
he
lose
a
limb
and
a
fine
new
artificial
one
was
at
his
disposal
get
indigestion
and
to
hand
was
artificial
digestive
fluid
or
bile
or
pancreatine
as
the
case
might
be
complexions
too
were
replaceable
spectacles
superseded
an
inefficient
and
imperceptible
false
diaphragms
were
thrust
into
the
failing
ear
so
he
went
over
our
anatomies
until
at
last
he
had
conjured
up
a
weird
thing
of
shreds
and
patches
a
simulacrum
an
artificial
body
of
a
man
with
but
a
doubtful
germ
of
living
flesh
lurking
somewhere
in
his
recesses
to
that
he
held
we
were
coming
how
far
such
odd
substitution
for
the
body
is
possible
need
not
concern
us
now
but
the
devil
speaking
by
the
lips
of
rudyard
kipling
hath
it
that
in
the
case
of
one
tomlinson
the
thing
so
far
as
the
soul
is
concerned
has
already
been
accomplished
time
was
when
men
had
simple
souls
desires
as
natural
as
their
eyes
a
little
reasonable
philanthropy
a
little
reasonable
philoprogenitiveness
hunger
and
a
taste
for
good
living
a
decent
personal
vanity
a
healthy
satisfying
pugnacity
and
so
forth
but
now
we
are
taught
and
disciplined
for
years
and
years
and
thereafter
we
read
and
read
for
all
the
time
some
strenuous
business
permits
pedagogic
hypnotists
pulpit
and
platform
hypnotists
hypnotists
hypnotists
are
at
us
all
this
sugar
you
are
eating
they
tell
us
is
ink
and
forthwith
we
reject
it
with
infinite
disgust
this
black
draught
of
unrequited
toil
is
true
happiness
and
down
it
goes
with
every
symptom
of
pleasure
this
ibsen
they
say
is
dull
past
believing
and
we
yawn
and
stretch
beyond
endurance
pardon
they
interrupt
but
this
ibsen
is
deep
and
delightful
and
we
vie
with
one
another
in
an
excess
of
entertainment
and
when
we
open
the
heads
of
these
two
young
people
we
find
not
a
straightforward
motive
on
the
surface
anywhere
we
find
indeed
not
a
soul
so
much
as
an
oversoul
a
zeitgeist
a
congestion
of
acquired
ideas
a
feast
of
fine
confused
thinking
the
girl
is
resolute
to
live
her
own
life
a
phrase
you
may
have
heard
before
and
the
man
has
a
pretty
perverted
ambition
to
be
a
cynical
artistic
person
of
the
very
calmest
description
he
is
hoping
for
the
awakening
of
passion
in
her
among
other
things
he
knows
passion
ought
to
awaken
from
the
he
has
studied
he
knows
she
admires
his
genius
but
he
is
unaware
that
she
does
not
admire
his
head
he
is
quite
a
distinguished
art
critic
in
london
and
he
met
her
at
that
celebrated
lady
her
stepmother
and
here
you
have
them
well
embarked
upon
the
adventure
both
are
in
the
first
stage
of
repentance
which
consists
as
you
have
probably
found
for
yourself
in
setting
your
teeth
hard
and
will
go
things
you
see
have
jarred
a
little
and
they
ride
on
their
way
together
with
a
certain
aloofness
of
manner
that
promises
ill
for
the
orthodox
development
of
the
adventure
he
perceives
he
was
too
precipitate
but
he
feels
his
honour
is
involved
and
meditates
the
development
of
a
new
attack
and
the
girl
she
is
unawakened
her
motives
are
bookish
written
by
a
haphazard
syndicate
of
authors
novelists
and
biographers
on
her
white
inexperience
an
artificial
oversoul
she
is
that
may
presently
break
down
and
reveal
a
human
being
beneath
it
she
is
still
in
that
schoolgirl
phase
when
a
talkative
old
man
is
more
interesting
than
a
young
one
and
when
to
be
an
eminent
mathematician
say
or
to
edit
a
daily
paper
seems
as
fine
an
ambition
as
any
girl
need
aspire
to
bechaniel
was
to
have
helped
her
to
attain
that
in
the
most
expeditious
manner
and
here
he
is
beside
her
talking
enigmatical
phrases
about
passion
looking
at
her
with
the
oddest
expression
and
once
and
that
was
his
gravest
offence
offering
to
kiss
her
at
any
rate
he
has
apologised
she
still
scarcely
realises
you
see
the
scrape
she
has
got
into
xvii
the
encounter
at
midhurst
we
left
hoopdriver
at
the
door
of
the
little
tea
toy
and
tobacco
shop
you
must
not
think
that
a
strain
is
put
on
coincidence
when
i
tell
you
that
next
door
to
that
was
the
name
of
the
little
old
lady
with
whom
hoopdriver
had
stopped
is
the
angel
hotel
and
in
the
angel
hotel
on
the
night
that
hoopdriver
reached
midhurst
were
and
beaumont
our
bechamel
and
jessie
milton
indeed
it
was
a
highly
probable
thing
for
if
one
goes
through
guildford
the
choice
of
southward
roads
is
limited
you
may
go
by
petersfield
to
portsmouth
or
by
midhurst
to
chichester
in
addition
to
which
highways
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
minor
roadways
to
petworth
or
pulborough
and
brightonward
and
coming
to
midhurst
from
the
north
the
entrance
lies
yawning
to
engulf
your
highly
respectable
cyclists
while
genial
teapot
is
equally
attractive
to
those
who
weigh
their
means
in
little
scales
but
to
people
unfamiliar
with
the
sussex
roads
and
such
were
the
three
persons
of
this
story
the
convergence
did
not
appear
to
be
so
inevitable
bechamel
tightening
his
chain
in
the
angel
yard
after
dinner
was
the
first
to
be
aware
of
their
reunion
he
saw
hoopdriver
walk
slowly
across
the
gateway
his
head
enhaloed
in
cigarette
smoke
and
pass
out
of
sight
up
the
street
incontinently
a
mass
of
cloudy
uneasiness
that
had
been
partly
dispelled
during
the
day
reappeared
and
concentrated
rapidly
into
definite
suspicion
he
put
his
screw
hammer
into
his
pocket
and
walked
through
the
archway
into
the
street
to
settle
the
business
forthwith
for
he
prided
himself
on
his
decision
hoopdriver
was
merely
promenading
and
they
met
face
to
face
at
the
sight
of
his
adversary
something
between
disgust
and
laughter
seized
hoopdriver
and
for
a
moment
destroyed
his
animosity
we
are
again
he
said
laughing
insincerely
in
a
sudden
outbreak
at
the
perversity
of
chance
the
other
man
in
brown
stopped
short
in
way
staring
then
his
face
assumed
an
expression
of
dangerous
civility
it
any
information
to
you
he
said
with
immense
politeness
i
remark
that
you
are
following
us
hoopdriver
for
some
occult
reason
resisted
his
characteristic
impulse
to
apologise
he
wanted
to
annoy
the
other
man
in
brown
and
a
sentence
that
had
come
into
his
head
in
a
previous
rehearsal
cropped
up
appropriately
when
said
hoopdriver
catching
his
breath
yet
bringing
the
question
out
valiantly
nevertheless
when
you
purchased
the
county
of
sussex
i
point
out
said
the
other
man
in
brown
i
object
we
object
not
only
to
your
proximity
to
us
to
be
frank
you
appear
to
be
following
us
with
an
can
always
said
hoopdriver
round
if
you
like
it
and
go
back
the
way
you
said
the
other
man
in
brown
it
i
thought
as
you
said
hoopdriver
quite
at
sea
but
rising
pluckily
to
the
unknown
occasion
what
was
the
man
driving
at
see
said
the
other
man
see
i
half
suspected
his
manner
changed
abruptly
to
a
quality
suspiciously
friendly
a
word
with
you
you
will
i
hope
give
me
ten
wonderful
things
were
dawning
on
hoopdriver
what
did
the
other
man
take
him
for
here
at
last
was
reality
he
hesitated
then
he
thought
of
an
admirable
phrase
some
communication
call
it
a
communication
said
the
other
man
can
spare
you
the
ten
minutes
said
hoopdriver
with
dignity
way
then
said
the
other
man
in
brown
and
they
walked
slowly
down
the
north
street
towards
the
grammar
school
there
was
perhaps
thirty
silence
the
other
man
stroked
his
moustache
nervously
dramatic
instincts
were
now
fully
awake
he
did
not
quite
understand
in
what
role
he
was
cast
but
it
was
evidently
something
dark
and
mysterious
doctor
conan
doyle
victor
hugo
and
alexander
dumas
were
well
within
range
of
reading
and
he
had
not
read
them
for
nothing
will
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
said
the
other
man
in
brown
is
always
the
best
course
said
hoopdriver
then
who
the
devil
set
you
on
this
business
me
on
this
business
pretend
to
be
stupid
your
employer
who
engaged
you
for
this
job
said
hoopdriver
confused
i
sure
the
other
man
in
brown
glanced
meaningly
down
at
his
hand
and
hoopdriver
following
him
mechanically
saw
a
yellow
milled
edge
glittering
in
the
twilight
now
your
shop
assistant
is
just
above
the
class
and
only
just
above
it
so
that
he
is
acutely
sensitive
on
the
point
hoopdriver
flushed
hotly
and
his
eyes
were
angry
as
he
met
those
of
the
other
man
in
brown
it
said
hoopdriver
stopping
and
facing
the
tempter
said
the
other
man
in
brown
surprised
and
so
saying
he
stowed
it
in
his
breeches
pocket
think
to
be
bribed
said
hoopdriver
whose
imagination
was
rapidly
expanding
the
situation
gosh
follow
you
now
dear
sir
said
the
other
man
in
brown
beg
your
pardon
i
misunderstood
you
i
really
beg
your
pardon
let
us
walk
on
in
your
profession
have
you
got
to
say
against
my
profession
really
you
know
there
are
detectives
of
an
inferior
description
watchers
the
whole
class
private
inquiry
i
did
not
realise
i
really
trust
you
will
overlook
what
was
after
all
you
must
admit
a
natural
indiscretion
men
of
honour
are
not
so
common
in
the
world
in
any
it
was
lucky
for
hoopdriver
that
in
midhurst
they
do
not
light
the
lamps
in
the
summer
time
or
the
one
they
were
passing
had
betrayed
him
as
it
was
he
had
to
snatch
suddenly
at
his
moustache
and
tug
fiercely
at
it
to
conceal
the
furious
tumult
of
exultation
the
passion
of
laughter
that
came
boiling
up
detective
even
in
the
shadow
bechamel
saw
that
a
laugh
was
stifled
but
he
put
it
down
to
the
fact
that
the
phrase
of
amused
his
interlocutor
come
round
yet
said
bechamel
to
himself
simply
holding
out
for
a
he
coughed
see
that
it
hurts
you
to
tell
me
who
your
employer
you
i
said
bechamel
appreciatively
the
thing
i
want
to
put
to
you
the
kernel
of
the
whole
business
you
need
not
answer
if
you
want
to
no
harm
done
in
my
telling
you
what
i
want
to
know
are
you
employed
to
watch
me
or
miss
milton
not
the
leaky
sort
said
hoopdriver
keeping
the
secret
he
did
not
know
with
immense
enjoyment
miss
milton
that
was
her
name
perhaps
tell
some
more
no
good
pumping
is
that
all
after
said
hoopdriver
bechamel
respected
himself
for
his
diplomatic
gifts
he
tried
to
catch
a
remark
by
throwing
out
a
confidence
take
it
there
are
two
people
concerned
in
watching
this
the
other
said
hoopdriver
calmly
but
controlling
with
enormous
internal
tension
his
the
other
was
really
brilliant
he
thought
my
wife
and
her
you
want
to
know
which
it
is
said
bechamel
arst
said
hoopdriver
his
exultation
getting
the
better
of
him
and
with
a
pretty
consciousness
of
repartee
bechamel
turned
impatiently
then
he
made
a
last
effort
give
a
note
to
know
just
the
precise
state
of
affairs
he
said
told
you
to
stow
that
said
hoopdriver
in
a
threatening
tone
and
added
with
perfect
truth
and
a
magnificent
mystery
quite
understand
who
dealing
with
but
you
will
he
spoke
with
such
conviction
that
he
half
believed
that
that
defective
office
of
his
in
london
baker
street
in
fact
really
existed
with
that
the
interview
terminated
bechamel
went
back
to
the
angel
perturbed
detectives
it
the
kind
of
thing
he
had
anticipated
at
all
hoopdriver
with
round
eyes
and
a
wondering
smile
walked
down
to
where
the
mill
waters
glittered
in
the
moonlight
and
after
meditating
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
for
a
space
with
occasional
murmurs
of
and
the
like
returned
with
mystery
even
in
his
paces
towards
the
town
xviii
that
glee
which
finds
expression
in
raised
eyebrows
and
long
low
whistling
noises
was
upon
hoopdriver
for
a
space
he
forgot
the
tears
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
here
was
a
new
game
and
a
real
one
hoopdriver
as
a
private
inquiry
agent
a
sherlock
holmes
in
fact
keeping
these
two
people
he
walked
slowly
back
from
the
bridge
until
he
was
opposite
the
angel
and
stood
for
ten
minutes
perhaps
contemplating
that
establishment
and
enjoying
all
the
strange
sensations
of
being
this
wonderful
this
mysterious
and
terrible
thing
everything
fell
into
place
in
his
scheme
he
had
of
course
by
a
kind
of
instinct
assumed
the
disguise
of
a
cyclist
picked
up
the
first
old
crock
he
came
across
as
a
means
of
pursuit
expense
was
to
be
then
he
tried
to
understand
what
it
was
in
particular
that
he
was
observing
stepmother
then
he
remembered
her
swimming
eyes
abruptly
came
a
wave
of
anger
that
surprised
him
washed
away
the
detective
superstructure
and
left
him
plain
hoopdriver
this
man
in
brown
with
his
confident
manner
and
his
proffered
half
sovereign
damn
him
was
up
to
no
good
else
why
should
he
object
to
being
watched
he
was
married
she
was
not
his
sister
he
began
to
understand
a
horrible
suspicion
of
the
state
of
affairs
came
into
head
surely
it
had
not
come
to
that
he
was
a
detective
he
would
find
out
how
was
it
to
be
done
he
began
to
submit
sketches
on
approval
to
himself
it
required
an
effort
before
he
could
walk
into
the
angel
bar
lemonade
and
bitter
please
said
hoopdriver
he
cleared
his
throat
and
bowlong
stopping
here
a
gentleman
and
a
young
lady
on
bicycles
young
a
married
said
the
barmaid
a
talkative
person
of
ample
dimensions
no
married
couples
stopping
here
but
a
and
miss
she
spelt
it
for
precision
got
the
name
right
young
man
said
hoopdriver
there
is
but
no
one
of
the
name
of
what
was
the
name
you
gave
said
hoopdriver
there
no
bowlong
said
the
barmaid
taking
up
a
glasscloth
and
a
drying
tumbler
and
beginning
to
polish
the
latter
off
i
thought
you
might
be
asking
for
beaumont
the
names
being
similar
were
you
expecting
them
on
bicycles
they
said
they
might
be
in
midhurst
come
presently
here
but
no
bowlong
sure
that
beaumont
the
name
said
hoopdriver
curious
the
names
being
so
alike
i
thought
and
so
they
conversed
at
some
length
hoopdriver
delighted
to
find
his
horrible
suspicion
disposed
of
the
barmaid
having
listened
awhile
at
the
staircase
volunteered
some
particulars
of
the
young
couple
upstairs
her
modesty
was
much
impressed
by
the
young
costume
so
she
intimated
and
hoopdriver
whispered
the
badinage
natural
to
the
occasion
at
which
she
was
coquettishly
shocked
be
no
knowing
which
is
which
in
a
year
or
two
said
the
barmaid
her
manner
too
she
got
off
her
machine
and
give
it
to
stick
up
against
the
kerb
and
in
she
marched
and
my
brother
says
she
to
stop
here
my
brother
mind
what
kind
of
room
but
i
want
a
room
with
a
good
view
if
one
to
be
got
says
she
he
comes
hurrying
in
after
and
looks
at
her
settled
the
rooms
she
says
and
says
just
like
that
i
can
fancy
my
brother
letting
me
boss
the
show
like
dessay
you
do
said
hoopdriver
the
truth
was
the
barmaid
looked
down
smiled
and
shook
her
head
put
down
the
tumbler
polished
and
took
up
another
that
had
been
draining
and
shook
the
drops
of
water
into
her
little
zinc
sink
be
a
nice
little
lot
to
marry
said
the
barmaid
be
wearing
the
well
as
the
is
i
think
what
girls
is
this
depreciation
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
was
hardly
to
taste
said
he
taking
up
his
change
is
all
the
go
with
you
ladies
and
always
was
be
wearing
yourself
before
a
couple
of
years
is
look
on
my
figger
said
the
barmaid
with
a
titter
i
one
of
your
fashionable
sort
gracious
no
i
feel
as
if
anything
on
me
not
more
than
if
forgot
well
there
she
put
down
the
glass
abruptly
dessay
old
fashioned
she
said
and
walked
humming
down
the
bar
you
said
hoopdriver
he
waited
until
he
caught
her
eye
then
with
his
native
courtesy
smiled
raised
his
cap
and
wished
her
good
evening
xix
then
hoopdriver
returned
to
the
little
room
with
the
windows
where
he
had
dined
and
where
the
bed
was
now
comfortably
made
sat
down
on
the
box
under
the
window
stared
at
the
moon
rising
on
the
shining
vicarage
roof
and
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
how
they
whirled
at
first
it
was
past
ten
and
most
of
midhurst
was
tucked
away
in
bed
some
one
up
the
street
was
learning
the
violin
at
rare
intervals
a
belated
inhabitant
hurried
home
and
woke
the
echoes
and
a
corncrake
kept
up
a
busy
churning
in
the
vicarage
garden
the
sky
was
deep
blue
with
a
still
luminous
afterglow
along
the
black
edge
of
the
hill
and
the
white
moon
overhead
save
for
a
couple
of
yellow
stars
had
the
sky
to
herself
at
first
his
thoughts
were
kinetic
of
deeds
and
not
relationships
there
was
this
malefactor
and
his
victim
and
it
had
fallen
on
hoopdriver
to
take
a
hand
in
the
game
he
was
married
did
she
know
he
was
married
never
for
a
moment
did
a
thought
of
evil
concerning
her
cross
mind
people
see
questions
of
morals
so
much
better
than
superior
persons
who
have
read
and
thought
themselves
complex
to
impotence
he
had
heard
her
voice
seen
the
frank
light
in
her
eyes
and
she
had
been
weeping
that
sufficed
the
rights
of
the
case
he
properly
grasped
but
he
would
and
that
smirking
well
swine
was
the
mildest
for
him
he
recalled
the
exceedingly
unpleasant
incident
of
the
railway
bridge
we
detain
yer
thenks
said
hoopdriver
aloud
in
a
strange
unnatural
contemptible
voice
supposed
to
represent
that
of
bechamel
the
beggar
be
level
with
him
yet
afraid
of
us
detectives
that
if
wardor
should
chance
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
within
earshot
well
and
good
for
a
space
he
meditated
chastisements
and
revenges
physical
impossibilities
for
the
most
part
bechamel
staggering
headlong
from
the
impact
of
large
but
to
tell
the
truth
ill
supported
fist
five
feet
nine
of
height
lifted
from
the
ground
and
quivering
under
a
vigorously
applied
horsewhip
so
pleasant
was
such
dreaming
that
peaked
face
under
the
moonlight
was
transfigured
one
might
have
paired
him
with
that
and
universally
admired
triumph
awakening
so
sweet
was
his
ecstasy
and
presently
with
his
thirst
for
revenge
glutted
by
six
or
seven
violent
assaults
a
duel
and
two
vigorous
murders
his
mind
came
round
to
the
young
lady
in
grey
again
she
was
a
plucky
one
too
he
went
over
the
incident
the
barmaid
at
the
angel
had
described
to
him
his
thoughts
ceased
to
be
a
torrent
smoothed
down
to
a
mirror
in
which
she
was
reflected
with
infinite
clearness
and
detail
never
met
anything
like
her
before
fancy
that
bolster
of
a
barmaid
being
dressed
in
that
way
he
whuffed
a
contemptuous
laugh
he
compared
her
colour
her
vigour
her
voice
with
the
young
ladies
in
business
with
whom
his
lot
had
been
cast
even
in
tears
she
was
beautiful
more
beautiful
indeed
to
him
for
it
made
her
seem
softer
and
weaker
more
accessible
and
such
weeping
as
he
had
seen
before
had
been
so
much
a
matter
of
damp
white
faces
red
noses
and
hair
coming
out
of
curl
your
assistant
becomes
something
of
a
judge
of
weeping
because
weeping
is
the
custom
of
all
young
ladies
in
business
when
for
any
reason
their
services
are
dispensed
with
she
could
weep
and
by
gosh
she
could
smile
he
knew
that
and
reverting
to
acting
abruptly
he
smiled
confidentially
at
the
puckered
pallor
of
the
moon
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
long
pensiveness
lasted
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
his
thoughts
of
action
returned
then
he
remembered
he
was
a
that
he
must
be
busy
it
would
be
in
character
to
make
notes
and
he
pulled
out
his
little
with
that
in
hand
he
fell
again
would
that
chap
tell
her
the
were
after
them
if
so
would
she
be
as
anxious
to
get
away
as
he
was
he
must
be
on
the
alert
if
possible
he
must
speak
to
her
just
a
significant
word
friend
trust
me
it
occurred
to
him
that
these
fugitives
might
rise
early
to
escape
at
that
he
thought
of
the
time
and
found
it
was
eleven
said
he
must
see
that
i
he
yawned
and
rose
the
blind
was
up
and
he
pulled
back
the
little
chintz
curtains
to
let
the
sunlight
strike
across
to
the
bed
hung
his
watch
within
good
view
of
his
pillow
on
a
nail
that
supported
a
and
sat
down
on
his
bed
to
undress
he
lay
awake
for
a
little
while
thinking
of
the
wonderful
possibilities
of
the
morrow
and
thence
he
passed
gloriously
into
the
wonderland
of
dreams
xx
the
pursuit
and
now
to
tell
of
hoopdriver
rising
with
the
sun
vigilant
active
wonderful
the
practicable
half
of
the
window
stuck
open
ears
alert
an
eye
flickering
incessantly
in
the
corner
panes
in
oblique
glances
at
the
angel
front
wardor
wanted
him
to
have
his
breakfast
downstairs
in
her
kitchen
but
that
would
have
meant
abandoning
the
watch
and
he
held
out
strongly
the
bicycle
occupied
under
protest
a
strategic
position
in
the
shop
he
was
expectant
by
six
in
the
morning
by
nine
horrible
fears
oppressed
him
that
his
quest
had
escaped
him
and
he
had
to
reconnoitre
the
angel
yard
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
there
he
found
the
ostler
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
in
these
decadent
days
brushing
down
the
bicycles
of
the
chase
and
he
returned
relieved
to
premises
and
about
ten
they
emerged
and
rode
quietly
up
the
north
street
he
watched
them
until
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
post
office
and
then
out
into
the
road
and
up
after
them
in
fine
style
they
went
by
the
where
the
old
stocks
and
the
whipping
posts
are
and
on
to
the
chichester
road
and
he
followed
gallantly
so
this
great
chase
began
they
did
not
look
round
and
he
kept
them
just
within
sight
getting
down
if
he
chanced
to
draw
closely
upon
them
round
a
corner
by
riding
vigorously
he
kept
quite
conveniently
near
them
for
they
made
but
little
hurry
he
grew
hot
indeed
and
his
knees
were
a
little
stiff
to
begin
with
but
that
was
all
there
was
little
danger
of
losing
them
for
a
thin
chalky
dust
lay
upon
the
road
and
the
track
of
her
tire
was
milled
like
a
shilling
and
his
was
a
chequered
ribbon
along
the
way
so
they
rode
by
monument
and
through
the
prettiest
of
villages
until
at
last
the
downs
rose
steeply
ahead
there
they
stopped
awhile
at
the
only
inn
in
the
place
and
hoopdriver
took
up
a
position
which
commanded
the
inn
door
and
mopped
his
face
and
thirsted
and
smoked
a
red
herring
cigarette
they
remained
in
the
inn
for
some
time
a
number
of
chubby
innocents
returning
home
from
school
stopped
and
formed
a
line
in
front
of
him
and
watched
him
quietly
but
firmly
for
the
space
of
ten
minutes
or
so
away
said
he
and
they
only
seemed
quietly
interested
he
asked
them
all
their
names
then
and
they
answered
indistinct
murmurs
he
gave
it
up
at
last
and
became
passive
on
his
gate
and
so
at
length
they
tired
of
him
the
couple
under
observation
occupied
the
inn
so
long
that
hoopdriver
at
the
thought
of
their
possible
employment
hungered
as
well
as
thirsted
clearly
they
were
lunching
it
was
a
cloudless
day
and
the
sun
at
the
meridian
beat
down
upon
the
top
of
head
a
shower
bath
of
sunshine
a
huge
jet
of
hot
light
it
made
his
head
swim
at
last
they
emerged
and
the
other
man
in
brown
looked
back
and
saw
him
they
rode
on
to
the
foot
of
the
down
and
dismounting
began
to
push
tediously
up
that
long
nearly
vertical
ascent
of
blinding
white
road
hoopdriver
hesitated
it
might
take
them
twenty
minutes
to
mount
that
beyond
was
empty
downland
perhaps
for
miles
he
decided
to
return
to
the
inn
and
snatch
a
hasty
meal
at
the
inn
they
gave
him
biscuits
and
cheese
and
a
misleading
pewter
measure
of
sturdy
ale
pleasant
under
the
palate
cool
in
the
throat
but
leaden
in
the
legs
of
a
hot
afternoon
he
felt
a
man
of
substance
as
he
emerged
in
the
blinding
sunshine
but
even
by
the
foot
of
the
down
the
sun
was
insisting
again
that
his
skull
was
too
small
for
his
brains
the
hill
had
gone
steeper
the
chalky
road
blazed
like
a
magnesium
light
and
his
front
wheel
began
an
apparently
incurable
squeaking
he
felt
as
a
man
from
mars
would
feel
if
he
were
suddenly
transferred
to
this
planet
about
three
times
as
heavy
as
he
was
wont
to
feel
the
two
little
black
figures
had
vanished
over
the
forehead
of
the
hill
be
all
right
said
hoopdriver
that
was
a
comforting
reflection
it
not
only
justified
a
slow
progress
up
the
hill
but
at
the
crest
a
sprawl
on
the
turf
beside
the
road
to
contemplate
the
weald
from
the
south
in
a
matter
of
two
days
he
had
crossed
that
spacious
valley
with
its
frozen
surge
of
green
hills
its
little
villages
and
townships
here
and
there
its
copses
and
cornfields
its
ponds
and
streams
like
jewelery
of
diamonds
and
silver
glittering
in
the
sun
the
north
downs
were
hidden
far
away
beyond
the
wealden
heights
down
below
was
the
little
village
of
cocking
and
up
the
hill
a
mile
perhaps
to
the
right
hung
a
flock
of
sheep
grazing
together
overhead
an
anxious
peewit
circled
against
the
blue
and
every
now
and
then
emitted
its
feeble
cry
up
here
the
heat
was
tempered
by
a
pleasant
breeze
hoopdriver
was
possessed
by
unreasonable
contentment
he
lit
himself
a
cigarette
and
lounged
more
comfortably
surely
the
sussex
ale
is
made
of
the
waters
of
lethe
of
poppies
and
pleasant
dreams
drowsiness
coiled
insidiously
about
him
he
awoke
with
a
guilty
start
to
find
himself
sprawling
prone
on
the
turf
with
his
cap
over
one
eye
he
sat
up
rubbed
his
eyes
and
realised
that
he
had
slept
his
head
was
still
a
trifle
heavy
and
the
chase
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
stooped
to
pick
up
his
overturned
machine
he
whipped
out
his
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
past
two
love
us
fancy
that
but
the
be
all
right
said
hoopdriver
wheeling
his
machine
back
to
the
chalky
road
must
scorch
till
i
overtake
he
mounted
and
rode
as
rapidly
as
the
heat
and
a
lingering
lassitude
permitted
now
and
then
he
had
to
dismount
to
examine
the
surface
where
the
road
forked
he
enjoyed
that
rather
he
said
aloud
and
decided
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
mind
that
he
had
a
wonderful
instinct
for
so
he
came
past
goodwood
station
and
lavant
and
approached
chichester
towards
four
and
then
came
a
terrible
thing
in
places
the
road
became
hard
in
places
were
the
crowded
indentations
of
a
recent
flock
of
sheep
and
at
last
in
the
throat
of
the
town
cobbles
and
the
stony
streets
branching
east
west
north
and
south
at
a
stone
cross
under
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
the
tracks
vanished
cricky
said
hoopdriver
dismounting
in
dismay
and
standing
agape
anything
said
an
inhabitant
at
the
kerb
said
hoopdriver
lost
the
spoor
and
walked
upon
his
way
leaving
the
inhabitant
marvelling
what
part
of
a
bicycle
a
spoor
might
be
hoopdriver
abandoning
tracking
began
asking
people
if
they
had
seen
a
young
lady
in
grey
on
a
bicycle
six
casual
people
and
he
began
to
feel
the
inquiry
was
conspicuous
and
desisted
but
what
was
to
be
done
hoopdriver
was
hot
tired
and
hungry
and
full
of
the
first
gnawings
of
a
monstrous
remorse
he
decided
to
get
himself
some
tea
and
meat
and
in
the
royal
george
he
meditated
over
the
business
in
a
melancholy
frame
enough
they
had
passed
out
of
his
world
vanished
and
all
his
wonderful
dreams
of
some
vague
crucial
interference
collapsed
like
a
castle
of
cards
what
a
fool
he
had
been
not
to
stick
to
them
like
a
leech
he
might
have
thought
but
there
what
was
the
good
of
that
sort
of
thing
now
he
thought
of
her
tears
of
her
helplessness
of
the
bearing
of
the
other
man
in
brown
and
his
wrath
and
disappointment
surged
higher
can
i
do
said
hoopdriver
aloud
bringing
his
fist
down
beside
the
teapot
what
would
sherlock
holmes
have
done
perhaps
after
all
there
might
be
such
things
as
clues
in
the
world
albeit
the
age
of
miracles
was
past
but
to
look
for
a
clue
in
this
intricate
network
of
cobbled
streets
to
examine
every
muddy
interstice
there
was
a
chance
by
looking
about
and
inquiry
at
the
various
inns
upon
that
he
began
but
of
course
they
might
have
ridden
straight
through
and
scarcely
a
soul
have
marked
them
and
then
came
a
positively
brilliant
idea
many
ways
are
there
out
of
chichester
said
hoopdriver
it
was
really
equal
to
sherlock
holmes
that
made
tracks
i
shall
find
those
tracks
if
not
in
the
he
was
then
in
east
street
and
he
started
at
once
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
place
discovering
incidentally
that
chichester
is
a
walled
city
in
passing
he
made
inquiries
at
the
black
swan
the
crown
and
the
red
lion
hotel
at
six
in
the
evening
he
was
walking
downcast
intent
as
one
who
had
dropped
money
along
the
road
towards
bognor
kicking
up
the
dust
with
his
shoes
and
fretting
with
disappointed
pugnacity
a
thwarted
crestfallen
hoopdriver
it
was
as
you
may
well
imagine
and
then
suddenly
there
jumped
upon
his
attention
a
broad
line
ribbed
like
a
shilling
and
close
beside
it
one
chequered
that
ever
and
again
split
into
two
said
hoopdriver
and
swung
round
on
his
heel
at
once
and
back
to
the
royal
george
helter
skelter
for
the
bicycle
they
were
minding
for
him
the
ostler
thought
he
was
confoundedly
imperious
considering
his
machine
xxi
at
bognor
that
seductive
gentleman
bechamel
had
been
working
up
to
a
crisis
he
had
started
upon
this
elopement
in
a
vein
of
fine
romance
immensely
proud
of
his
wickedness
and
really
as
much
in
love
as
an
artificial
oversoul
can
be
with
jessie
but
either
she
was
the
profoundest
of
coquettes
or
she
had
not
the
slightest
element
of
passion
with
a
large
p
in
her
composition
it
warred
with
all
his
ideas
of
himself
and
the
feminine
mind
to
think
that
under
their
flattering
circumstances
she
really
could
be
so
vitally
deficient
he
found
her
persistent
coolness
her
more
or
less
evident
contempt
for
himself
exasperating
in
the
highest
degree
he
put
it
to
himself
that
she
was
enough
to
provoke
a
saint
and
tried
to
think
that
was
piquant
and
enjoyable
but
the
blisters
on
his
vanity
asserted
themselves
the
fact
is
he
was
under
this
standing
irritation
getting
down
to
the
natural
man
in
himself
for
once
and
the
natural
man
in
himself
in
spite
of
oxford
and
the
junior
club
was
a
palaeolithic
creature
of
simple
tastes
and
violent
methods
be
level
with
you
yet
ran
like
a
plough
through
the
soil
of
his
thoughts
then
there
was
this
infernal
detective
bechamel
had
told
his
wife
he
was
going
to
davos
to
see
carter
to
that
he
had
fancied
she
was
reconciled
but
how
she
would
take
this
exploit
was
entirely
problematical
she
was
a
woman
of
peculiar
moral
views
and
she
measured
marital
infidelity
largely
by
its
proximity
to
herself
out
of
her
sight
and
more
particularly
out
of
the
sight
of
the
other
women
of
her
set
vice
of
the
recognised
description
was
perhaps
permissible
to
those
contemptible
weaklings
men
but
this
was
evil
on
the
high
roads
she
was
bound
to
make
a
fuss
and
these
fusses
invariably
took
the
final
form
of
a
tightness
of
money
for
bechamel
albeit
and
he
felt
it
was
heroic
of
him
to
resolve
so
it
was
worth
doing
if
it
was
to
be
done
his
imagination
worked
on
a
kind
of
matronly
valkyrie
and
the
noise
of
pursuit
and
vengeance
was
in
the
air
the
idyll
still
had
the
front
of
the
stage
that
accursed
detective
it
seemed
had
been
thrown
off
the
scent
and
that
at
any
rate
gave
a
respite
but
things
must
be
brought
to
an
issue
forthwith
by
eight
in
the
evening
in
a
little
in
the
vicuna
hotel
bognor
the
crisis
had
come
and
jessie
flushed
and
angry
in
the
face
and
with
her
heart
sinking
faced
him
again
for
her
last
struggle
with
him
he
had
tricked
her
this
time
effectually
and
luck
had
been
on
his
side
she
was
booked
as
beaumont
save
for
her
refusal
to
enter
their
room
and
her
eccentricity
of
eating
with
unwashed
hands
she
had
so
far
kept
up
the
appearances
of
things
before
the
waiter
but
the
dinner
was
grim
enough
now
in
turn
she
appealed
to
his
better
nature
and
made
extravagant
statements
of
her
plans
to
fool
him
he
was
white
and
vicious
by
this
time
and
his
anger
quivered
through
his
pose
of
brilliant
wickedness
will
go
to
the
station
she
said
will
go
back
last
train
for
anywhere
leaves
at
will
appeal
to
the
police
know
will
tell
these
hotel
will
turn
you
out
of
doors
in
such
a
thoroughly
false
position
now
they
understand
unconventionality
down
she
stamped
her
foot
i
wander
about
the
streets
all
night
she
said
who
have
never
been
out
alone
after
dusk
do
you
know
what
the
streets
of
a
charming
little
holiday
resort
are
like
care
she
said
can
go
to
the
clergyman
a
charming
man
unmarried
and
men
are
really
more
alike
than
you
think
and
anyhow
can
you
explain
the
last
two
nights
to
anyone
now
the
mischief
is
done
cur
she
said
and
suddenly
put
her
hand
to
her
breast
he
thought
she
meant
to
faint
but
she
stood
with
the
colour
gone
from
her
face
he
said
love
said
she
are
ways
yet
she
said
after
a
pause
for
you
you
are
too
full
of
life
and
hope
yet
for
what
is
it
not
the
dark
arch
nor
the
black
flowing
river
you
think
of
it
only
shirk
it
when
the
moment
comes
and
turn
it
all
into
she
turned
round
abruptly
from
him
and
stood
looking
out
across
the
parade
at
the
shining
sea
over
which
the
afterglow
of
day
fled
before
the
rising
moon
he
maintained
his
attitude
the
blinds
were
still
up
for
she
had
told
the
waiter
not
to
draw
them
there
was
silence
for
some
moments
at
last
he
spoke
in
as
persuasive
a
voice
as
he
could
summon
it
sensibly
jessie
why
should
we
who
have
so
much
in
common
quarrel
into
melodrama
i
swear
i
love
you
you
are
all
that
is
bright
and
desirable
to
me
i
am
stronger
than
you
older
man
to
your
woman
to
find
you
too
conventional
she
looked
at
him
over
her
shoulder
and
he
noticed
with
a
twinge
of
delight
how
her
little
chin
came
out
beneath
the
curve
of
her
cheek
she
said
to
my
woman
do
men
lie
would
a
man
use
his
five
and
thirty
experience
to
outwit
a
girl
of
seventeen
man
to
my
woman
indeed
that
surely
is
the
last
insult
repartee
is
admirable
jessie
i
should
say
they
do
though
all
that
and
more
also
when
their
hearts
were
set
on
such
a
girl
as
yourself
for
sake
drop
this
shrewishness
why
should
you
be
so
difficult
to
me
here
am
i
with
my
reputation
my
career
at
your
feet
look
here
jessie
on
my
honour
i
will
marry
you
forbid
she
said
so
promptly
that
she
never
learnt
he
had
a
wife
even
then
it
occurred
to
him
then
for
the
first
time
in
the
flash
of
her
retort
that
she
did
not
know
he
was
married
only
a
settlement
he
said
following
that
hint
he
paused
must
be
sensible
the
your
own
doing
come
out
on
the
beach
now
the
beach
here
is
splendid
and
the
moon
will
soon
be
she
said
stamping
her
foot
well
leave
me
alone
let
me
think
he
said
you
want
to
your
cry
always
but
you
save
yourself
by
thinking
my
dear
girl
you
save
yourself
in
any
way
now
if
saving
it
is
this
parsimony
go
well
i
will
go
i
will
go
and
smoke
a
cigar
and
think
of
you
dear
but
do
you
think
i
should
do
all
this
if
i
did
not
care
she
whispered
without
glancing
round
she
continued
to
stare
out
of
the
window
he
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
with
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
he
made
a
step
towards
her
have
you
he
said
are
mine
netted
caught
but
he
would
have
gone
up
to
her
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
but
he
did
not
dare
to
do
that
yet
have
you
in
my
hand
he
said
my
power
do
you
hear
power
she
remained
impassive
he
stared
at
her
for
half
a
minute
and
then
with
a
superb
gesture
that
was
lost
upon
her
went
to
the
door
surely
the
instinctive
abasement
of
her
sex
before
strength
was
upon
his
side
he
told
himself
that
his
battle
was
won
she
heard
the
handle
move
and
the
catch
click
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
xxii
and
now
without
in
the
twilight
behold
hoopdriver
his
cheeks
hot
his
eye
bright
his
brain
is
in
a
tumult
the
nervous
obsequious
hoopdriver
to
whom
i
introduced
you
some
days
since
has
undergone
a
wonderful
change
ever
since
he
lost
that
in
chichester
he
has
been
tormented
by
the
most
horrible
visions
of
the
shameful
insults
that
may
be
happening
the
strangeness
of
new
surroundings
has
been
working
to
strip
off
the
habitual
servile
from
him
here
was
moonlight
rising
over
the
memory
of
a
red
sunset
dark
shadows
and
glowing
orange
lamps
beauty
somewhere
mysteriously
rapt
away
from
him
tangible
wrong
in
a
brown
suit
and
an
unpleasant
face
flouting
him
hoopdriver
for
the
time
was
in
the
world
of
romance
and
divinely
forgetful
of
his
social
position
or
hers
forgetting
too
for
the
time
any
of
the
wretched
timidities
that
had
tied
him
long
since
behind
the
counter
in
his
proper
place
he
was
angry
and
adventurous
it
was
all
about
him
this
vivid
drama
he
had
fallen
into
and
it
was
eluding
him
he
was
far
too
grimly
in
earnest
to
pick
up
that
lost
thread
and
make
a
play
of
it
now
the
man
was
living
he
did
not
pose
when
he
alighted
at
the
coffee
tavern
even
nor
when
he
made
his
hasty
meal
as
bechamel
crossed
from
the
vicuna
towards
the
esplanade
hoopdriver
disappointed
and
exasperated
came
hurrying
round
the
corner
from
the
temperance
hotel
at
the
sight
of
bechamel
his
heart
jumped
and
the
tension
of
his
angry
suspense
exploded
into
rather
than
gave
place
to
an
excited
activity
of
mind
they
were
at
the
vicuna
and
she
was
there
now
alone
it
was
the
occasion
he
sought
but
he
would
give
chance
no
chance
against
him
he
went
back
round
the
corner
sat
down
on
the
seat
and
watched
bechamel
recede
into
the
dimness
up
the
esplanade
before
he
got
up
and
walked
into
the
hotel
entrance
lady
cyclist
in
grey
he
asked
for
and
followed
boldly
on
the
heels
the
door
of
the
was
opening
before
he
felt
a
qualm
and
then
suddenly
he
was
nearly
minded
to
turn
and
run
for
it
and
his
features
seemed
to
him
to
be
convulsed
she
turned
with
a
start
and
looked
at
him
with
something
between
terror
and
hope
in
her
eyes
i
have
a
few
words
with
you
alone
said
hoopdriver
controlling
his
breath
with
difficulty
she
hesitated
and
then
motioned
the
waiter
to
withdraw
hoopdriver
watched
the
door
shut
he
had
intended
to
step
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
fold
his
arms
and
say
are
in
trouble
i
am
a
friend
trust
instead
of
which
he
stood
panting
and
then
spoke
with
sudden
familiarity
hastily
guiltily
here
i
know
what
the
juice
is
up
but
i
think
something
wrong

my
intruding
if
it
so

to
help

out
of
the
scrape
if
in
one
my
meaning
i
believe
what
can
i
do
i
would
do
anything
to
help
her
brow
puckered
as
she
watched
him
make
with
infinite
emotion
this
remarkable
speech
she
said
she
was
tumultuously
weighing
possibilities
in
her
mind
and
he
had
scarcely
ceased
when
she
had
made
her
resolve
she
stepped
a
pace
forward
are
a
gentleman
she
said
said
hoopdriver
i
trust
you
she
did
not
wait
for
his
assurance
must
leave
this
hotel
at
once
come
she
took
his
arm
and
led
him
to
the
window
can
just
see
the
gate
it
is
still
open
through
that
are
our
bicycles

down

them
out
and
i
will
come
down
to

bicycle

good
at
once

way
out
by
the
front
door
and
round
i
will
follow
in
one
said
hoopdriver
and
went
he
had
to
get
those
bicycles
had
he
been
told
to
go
out
and
kill
bechamel
he
would
have
done
it
his
head
was
a
maelstrom
now
he
walked
out
of
the
hotel
along
the
front
and
into
the
big
coach
yard
he
looked
round
there
were
no
bicycles
visible
then
a
man
emerged
from
the
dark
a
short
man
in
a
short
black
shiny
jacket
hoopdriver
was
caught
he
made
no
attempt
to
turn
and
run
for
it
been
giving
your
machines
a
wipe
over
sir
said
the
man
recognising
the
suit
and
touching
his
cap
intelligence
now
was
a
soaring
eagle
he
swooped
on
the
situation
at
once
right
he
said
and
added
before
the
pause
became
marked
is
mine
i
want
to
look
at
the
the
man
led
him
into
an
open
shed
and
went
fumbling
for
a
lantern
hoopdriver
moved
the
machine
out
of
his
way
to
the
door
and
then
laid
hands
on
the
machine
and
wheeled
it
out
of
the
shed
into
the
yard
the
gate
stood
open
and
beyond
was
the
pale
road
and
a
clump
of
trees
black
in
the
twilight
he
stooped
and
examined
the
chain
with
trembling
fingers
how
was
it
to
be
done
something
behind
the
gate
seemed
to
flutter
the
man
must
be
got
rid
of
anyhow
say
said
hoopdriver
with
an
inspiration
you
get
me
a
screwdriver
the
man
simply
walked
across
the
shed
opened
and
shut
a
box
and
came
up
to
the
kneeling
hoopdriver
with
a
screwdriver
in
his
hand
hoopdriver
felt
himself
a
lost
man
he
took
the
screwdriver
with
a
tepid
and
incontinently
had
another
inspiration
say
he
said
again
is
miles
too
the
man
lit
the
lantern
brought
it
up
to
hoopdriver
and
put
it
down
on
the
ground
a
smaller
screwdriver
he
said
hoopdriver
had
his
handkerchief
out
and
sneezed
a
prompt
atichew
it
is
the
orthodox
thing
when
you
wish
to
avoid
recognition
small
as
you
have
he
said
out
of
his
pocket
handkerchief
got
none
smaller
than
that
said
the
ostler
do
really
said
hoopdriver
still
wallowing
in
his
handkerchief
see
wot
they
got
in
the
if
you
like
sir
said
the
man
you
would
said
hoopdriver
and
as
the
heavily
nailed
boots
went
clattering
down
the
yard
hoopdriver
stood
up
took
a
noiseless
step
to
the
machine
laid
trembling
hands
on
its
handle
and
saddle
and
prepared
for
a
rush
the
scullery
door
opened
momentarily
and
sent
a
beam
of
warm
yellow
light
up
the
road
shut
again
behind
the
man
and
forthwith
hoopdriver
rushed
the
machines
towards
the
gate
a
dark
grey
form
came
fluttering
to
meet
him
me
this
she
said
bring
he
passed
the
thing
to
her
touched
her
hand
in
the
darkness
ran
back
seized
machine
and
followed
the
yellow
light
of
the
scullery
door
suddenly
flashed
upon
the
cobbles
again
it
was
too
late
now
to
do
anything
but
escape
he
heard
the
ostler
shout
behind
him
and
came
into
the
road
she
was
up
and
dim
already
he
got
into
the
saddle
without
a
blunder
in
a
moment
the
ostler
was
in
the
gateway
with
a
sir
that
allowed
and
hoopdriver
was
overtaking
the
young
lady
in
grey
for
some
moments
the
earth
seemed
alive
with
shouts
of
and
the
shadows
with
ambuscades
of
police
the
road
swept
round
and
they
were
riding
out
of
sight
of
the
hotel
and
behind
dark
hedges
side
by
side
she
was
weeping
with
excitement
as
he
overtook
her
she
said
and
he
ceased
to
feel
like
a
hunted
thief
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
about
him
and
saw
that
they
were
already
out
of
bognor
for
the
vicuna
stands
at
the
very
westernmost
extremity
of
the
sea
front
and
riding
on
a
fair
wide
road
xxiii
the
ostler
being
a
fool
rushed
violently
down
the
road
vociferating
after
them
then
he
returned
panting
to
the
vicuna
hotel
and
finding
a
group
of
men
outside
the
entrance
who
wanted
to
know
what
was
up
stopped
to
give
them
the
cream
of
the
adventure
that
gave
the
fugitives
five
minutes
then
pushing
breathlessly
into
the
bar
he
had
to
make
it
clear
to
the
barmaid
what
the
matter
was
and
the
being
out
they
spent
some
more
precious
time
wondering
was
to
be
done
in
which
the
two
customers
returning
from
outside
joined
with
animation
there
were
also
moral
remarks
and
other
irrelevant
contributions
there
were
conflicting
ideas
of
telling
the
police
and
pursuing
the
flying
couple
on
a
horse
that
made
ten
minutes
then
stephen
the
waiter
who
had
shown
hoopdriver
up
came
down
and
lit
wonderful
lights
and
started
quite
a
fresh
discussion
by
the
simple
question
that
turned
ten
minutes
into
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
in
the
midst
of
this
discussion
making
a
sudden
and
awestricken
silence
appeared
bechamel
in
the
hall
beyond
the
bar
walked
with
a
resolute
air
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
passed
out
of
sight
you
conceive
the
backward
pitch
of
that
exceptionally
shaped
cranium
incredulous
eyes
stared
into
one
in
the
bar
as
his
paces
muffled
by
the
stair
carpet
went
up
to
the
landing
turned
reached
the
passage
and
walked
into
the
overhead
that
one
at
all
miss
said
the
ostler
beaumont
said
the
barmaid
their
conversation
hung
comatose
in
the
air
switched
up
by
bechamel
they
listened
together
his
feet
stopped
turned
went
out
of
the
diningroom
down
the
passage
to
the
bedroom
stopped
again
chap
said
the
barmaid
a
wicked
woman
said
stephen
after
a
pause
bechamel
went
back
to
the
they
heard
a
chair
creak
under
him
interlude
of
conversational
eyebrows
going
up
said
stephen
break
the
melancholy
news
to
bechamel
looked
up
from
a
newspaper
as
without
knocking
stephen
entered
face
suggested
a
different
expectation
pardon
sir
said
stephen
with
a
diplomatic
cough
said
bechamel
wondering
suddenly
if
jessie
had
kept
some
of
her
threats
if
so
he
was
in
for
an
explanation
but
he
had
it
ready
she
was
a
monomaniac
me
alone
with
her
he
would
say
know
how
to
calm
beaumont
said
stephen
he
rose
with
a
fine
surprise
he
said
with
a
half
laugh
sir
on
her
her
bicycle
why
went
sir
with
another
this
time
bechamel
was
really
startled
other
gentlemen
who
gentleman
in
brown
sir
went
into
the
yard
sir
got
out
the
two
bicycles
sir
and
went
off
sir
about
twenty
minutes
bechamel
stood
with
his
eyes
round
and
his
knuckle
on
his
hips
stephen
watching
him
with
immense
enjoyment
speculated
whether
this
abandoned
husband
would
weep
or
curse
or
rush
off
at
once
in
furious
pursuit
but
as
yet
he
seemed
merely
stunned
clothes
he
said
fairish
little
like
yourself
sir
in
the
dark
the
ostler
sir
jim
duke
bechamel
laughed
awry
then
with
infinite
fervour
he
said
but
let
us
put
in
blank
cartridge
he
said
might
have
thought
he
flung
himself
into
the
armchair
her
said
bechamel
for
all
the
world
like
a
common
man
chuck
this
infernal
business
gone
eigh
let
go
said
bechamel
making
a
memorable
saying
go
who
cares
and
i
wish
him
luck
and
bring
me
some
bourbon
as
fast
as
you
can
a
good
chap
take
that
and
then
have
another
look
round
bognor
before
i
turn
stephen
was
too
surprised
to
say
anything
but
sir
on
said
bechamel
you
sympathies
changed
at
once
he
murmured
fumbling
for
the
door
handle
and
left
the
room
marvelling
bechamel
having
in
this
way
satisfied
his
sense
of
appearances
and
comported
himself
as
a
pagan
should
so
soon
as
the
footsteps
had
passed
vented
the
cream
of
his
feelings
in
a
stream
of
blasphemous
indecency
whether
his
wife
or
her
stepmother
had
sent
the
detective
she
had
evidently
gone
off
with
him
and
that
little
business
was
over
and
he
was
here
stranded
and
sold
an
ass
and
as
it
were
the
son
of
many
generations
of
asses
and
his
only
ray
of
hope
was
that
it
seemed
more
probable
after
all
that
the
girl
had
escaped
through
her
stepmother
in
which
case
the
business
might
be
hushed
up
yet
and
the
evil
hour
of
explanation
with
his
wife
indefinitely
postponed
then
abruptly
the
image
of
that
lithe
figure
in
grey
knickerbockers
went
frisking
across
his
mind
again
and
he
reverted
to
his
blasphemies
he
started
up
in
a
gusty
frenzy
with
a
vague
idea
of
pursuit
and
incontinently
sat
down
again
with
a
concussion
that
stirred
the
bar
below
to
its
depths
he
banged
the
arms
of
the
chair
with
his
fist
and
swore
again
all
the
accursed
fools
that
were
ever
spawned
he
was
chanting
bechamel
when
with
an
abrupt
tap
and
prompt
opening
of
the
door
stephen
entered
with
the
bourbon
xxiv
the
moonlight
ride
and
so
the
twenty
law
passed
into
an
infinity
we
leave
the
wicked
bechamel
clothing
himself
with
cursing
as
with
a
garment
the
wretched
creature
has
already
sufficiently
sullied
our
modest
but
truthful
pages
we
leave
the
eager
little
group
in
the
bar
of
the
vicuna
hotel
we
leave
all
bognor
as
we
have
left
all
chichester
and
midhurst
and
haslemere
and
guildford
and
ripley
and
putney
and
follow
this
dear
fool
of
a
hoopdriver
of
ours
and
his
young
lady
in
grey
out
upon
the
moonlight
road
how
they
rode
how
their
hearts
beat
together
and
their
breath
came
fast
and
how
every
shadow
was
anticipation
and
every
noise
pursuit
for
all
that
flight
hoopdriver
was
in
the
world
of
romance
had
a
policeman
intervened
because
their
lamps
were
not
lit
hoopdriver
had
cut
him
down
and
ridden
on
after
the
fashion
of
a
hero
born
had
bechamel
arisen
in
the
way
with
rapiers
for
a
duel
hoopdriver
had
fought
as
one
to
whom
agincourt
was
a
reality
and
drapery
a
dream
it
was
rescue
elopement
glory
and
she
by
the
side
of
him
he
had
seen
her
face
in
shadow
with
the
morning
sunlight
tangled
in
her
hair
he
had
seen
her
sympathetic
with
that
warm
light
in
her
face
he
had
seen
her
troubled
and
her
eyes
bright
with
tears
but
what
light
is
there
lighting
a
face
like
hers
to
compare
with
the
soft
glamour
of
the
midsummer
moon
the
road
turned
northward
going
round
through
the
outskirts
of
bognor
in
one
place
dark
and
heavy
under
a
thick
growth
of
trees
then
amidst
villas
again
some
warm
and
lamplit
some
white
and
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
then
between
hedges
over
which
they
saw
broad
wan
meadows
shrouded
in
a
mist
they
scarcely
heeded
whither
they
rode
at
first
being
only
anxious
to
get
away
turning
once
westward
when
the
spire
of
chichester
cathedral
rose
suddenly
near
them
out
of
the
dewy
night
pale
and
intricate
and
high
they
rode
speaking
little
just
a
rare
word
now
and
then
at
a
turning
at
a
footfall
at
a
roughness
in
the
road
she
seemed
to
be
too
intent
upon
escape
to
give
much
thought
to
him
but
after
the
first
tumult
of
the
adventure
as
flight
passed
into
mere
steady
ridin
his
mind
became
an
enormous
appreciation
of
the
position
the
night
was
a
warm
white
silence
save
for
the
subtile
running
of
their
chains
he
looked
sideways
at
her
as
she
sat
beside
him
with
her
ankles
gracefully
ruling
the
treadles
now
the
road
turned
westward
and
she
was
a
dark
grey
outline
against
the
shimmer
of
the
moon
and
now
they
faced
northwards
and
the
soft
cold
light
passed
caressingly
over
her
hair
and
touched
her
brow
and
cheek
there
is
a
magic
quality
in
moonshine
it
touches
all
that
is
sweet
and
beautiful
and
the
rest
of
the
night
is
hidden
it
has
created
the
fairies
whom
the
sunlight
kills
and
fairyland
rises
again
in
our
hearts
at
the
sight
of
it
the
voices
of
the
filmy
route
and
their
faint
melodies
by
the
moonlight
every
man
dull
clod
though
he
be
by
day
tastes
something
of
endymion
takes
something
of
the
youth
and
strength
of
enidymion
and
sees
the
dear
white
goddess
shining
at
him
from
his
eyes
the
firm
substantial
daylight
things
become
ghostly
and
elusive
the
hills
beyond
are
a
sea
of
unsubstantial
texture
the
world
a
visible
spirit
the
spiritual
within
us
rises
out
of
its
darkness
loses
something
of
its
weight
and
body
and
swims
up
towards
heaven
this
road
that
was
a
mere
rutted
white
dust
hot
underfoot
blinding
to
the
eye
is
now
a
soft
grey
silence
with
the
glitter
of
a
crystal
grain
set
starlike
in
its
silver
here
and
there
overhead
riding
serenely
through
the
spacious
blue
is
the
mother
of
the
silence
she
who
has
spiritualised
the
world
alone
save
for
two
attendant
steady
shining
stars
and
in
silence
under
her
benign
influence
under
the
benediction
of
her
light
rode
our
two
wanderers
side
by
side
through
the
transfigured
and
transfiguring
night
nowhere
was
the
moon
shining
quite
so
brightly
as
in
skull
at
the
turnings
of
the
road
he
made
his
decisions
with
an
air
of
profound
promptitude
and
quite
haphazard
right
he
would
say
or
again
left
as
one
who
knew
so
it
was
that
in
the
space
of
an
hour
they
came
abruptly
down
a
little
lane
full
tilt
upon
the
sea
grey
beach
to
the
right
of
them
and
to
the
left
and
a
little
white
cottage
fast
asleep
inland
of
a
sleeping
said
hoopdriver
sotto
voce
they
dismounted
abruptly
stunted
oaks
and
thorns
rose
out
of
the
haze
of
moonlight
that
was
tangled
in
the
hedge
on
either
side
are
safe
said
hoopdriver
sweeping
off
his
cap
with
an
air
and
bowing
courtly
are
we
where
he
waved
his
arm
seaward
as
though
it
was
a
goal
you
think
they
will
follow
us
have
turned
and
turned
it
seemed
to
hoopdriver
that
he
heard
her
sob
she
stood
dimly
there
holding
her
machine
and
he
holding
his
could
go
no
nearer
to
her
to
see
if
she
sobbed
for
weeping
or
for
want
of
breath
are
we
to
do
now
her
voice
asked
you
tired
he
asked
will
do
what
has
to
be
the
two
black
figures
in
the
broken
light
were
silent
for
a
space
you
know
she
said
am
not
afraid
of
you
i
am
sure
you
are
honest
to
me
and
i
do
not
even
know
your
name
he
was
taken
with
a
sudden
shame
of
his
homely
patronymic
an
ugly
name
he
said
you
are
right
in
trusting
me
i
would
i
would
do
anything
for
you
this
is
she
caught
at
her
breath
she
did
not
care
to
ask
why
but
compared
with
bechamel
take
each
other
on
trust
she
said
you
want
to
know
how
things
are
with
me
man
she
went
on
after
the
assent
of
his
listening
silence
to
help
and
protect
me
i
was
unhappy
at
home
never
mind
why
a
stepmother
idle
unoccupied
hindered
cramped
that
is
enough
perhaps
then
he
came
into
my
life
and
talked
to
me
of
art
and
literature
and
set
my
brain
on
fire
i
wanted
to
come
out
into
the
world
to
be
a
human
being
not
a
thing
in
a
hutch
and
he
know
said
hoopdriver
now
here
i
am
will
do
anything
said
hoopdriver
she
thought
can
not
imagine
my
stepmother
no
i
could
not
describe
her
am
entirely
at
your
service
i
will
help
you
with
all
my
have
lost
an
illusion
and
found
a
she
spoke
of
bechamel
as
the
illusion
hoopdriver
felt
flattered
but
he
had
no
adequate
answer
thinking
he
said
full
of
a
rapture
of
protective
responsibility
we
had
best
be
doing
you
are
tired
you
know
and
we
wander
all
night
after
the
day
was
chichester
we
were
near
she
asked
he
meditated
with
a
tremble
in
his
voice
would
make
me
your
brother
miss
could
stop
there
together
she
took
a
minute
to
answer
am
going
to
light
these
lamps
said
hoopdriver
he
bent
down
to
his
own
and
struck
a
match
on
his
shoe
she
looked
at
his
face
in
its
light
grave
and
intent
how
could
she
ever
have
thought
him
common
or
absurd
you
must
tell
me
your
name
brother
she
said
carrington
said
hoopdriver
after
a
momentary
pause
who
would
be
hoopdriver
on
a
night
like
this
the
christian
name
name
my
christian
name
well
he
snapped
his
lamp
and
stood
up
you
will
hold
my
machine
i
will
light
yours
he
said
she
came
round
obediently
and
took
his
machine
and
for
a
moment
they
stood
face
to
face
name
brother
chris
she
said
he
looked
into
her
eyes
and
his
excitement
seemed
arrested
he
repeated
slowly
the
mute
emotion
of
his
face
affected
her
strangely
she
had
to
speak
not
such
a
very
wonderful
name
is
it
she
said
with
a
laugh
to
break
the
intensity
he
opened
his
mouth
and
shut
it
again
and
with
a
sudden
wincing
of
his
features
abruptly
turned
and
bent
down
to
open
the
lantern
in
front
of
her
machine
she
looked
down
at
him
almost
kneeling
in
front
of
her
with
an
unreasonable
approbation
in
her
eyes
it
was
as
i
have
indicated
the
hour
and
season
of
the
full
moon
xxv
hoopdriver
conducted
the
rest
of
that
journey
with
the
same
confident
dignity
as
before
and
it
was
chiefly
by
good
luck
and
the
fact
that
most
roads
about
a
town
converge
thereupon
that
chichester
was
at
last
attained
it
seemed
at
first
as
though
everyone
had
gone
to
bed
but
the
red
hotel
still
glowed
yellow
and
warm
it
was
the
first
time
hoopdriver
bad
dared
the
mysteries
of
a
but
that
night
he
was
in
the
mood
to
dare
anything
you
found
your
young
lady
at
last
said
the
ostler
of
the
red
hotel
for
it
chanced
he
was
one
of
those
of
whom
hoopdriver
had
made
inquiries
in
the
afternoon
a
misunderstanding
said
hoopdriver
with
splendid
readiness
sister
had
gone
to
bognor
but
i
brought
her
back
here
took
a
fancy
to
this
place
and
the
simply
had
supper
thenks
and
tired
said
hoopdriver
suppose
you
take
anything
jessie
the
glory
of
having
her
even
as
a
sister
and
to
call
her
jessie
like
that
but
he
carried
it
off
splendidly
as
he
felt
himself
bound
to
admit
sis
he
said
pleasant
dreams
just
a
look
at
this
paper
before
i
turn
but
this
was
living
indeed
he
told
himself
so
gallantly
did
hoopdriver
comport
himself
up
to
the
very
edge
of
the
most
wonderful
day
of
all
it
had
begun
early
you
will
remember
with
a
vigil
in
a
little
sweetstuff
shop
next
door
to
the
angel
at
midhurst
but
to
think
of
all
the
things
that
had
happened
since
then
he
caught
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
yawn
pulled
out
his
watch
saw
the
time
was
halfpast
eleven
and
marched
off
with
a
fine
sense
of
heroism
bedward
xxvi
the
surbiton
interlude
and
here
thanks
to
the
glorious
institution
of
sleep
comes
a
break
in
the
narrative
again
these
absurd
young
people
are
safely
tucked
away
now
their
heads
full
of
glowing
nonsense
indeed
but
the
course
of
events
at
any
rate
is
safe
from
any
fresh
developments
through
their
activities
for
the
next
eight
hours
or
more
they
are
both
sleeping
healthily
you
will
perhaps
be
astonished
to
hear
here
is
the
girl
what
girls
are
coming
to
nowadays
only
lynn
linton
can
tell
in
company
with
an
absolute
stranger
of
low
extraction
and
uncertain
accent
unchaperoned
and
unabashed
indeed
now
she
fancies
she
is
safe
she
is
if
anything
a
little
proud
of
her
own
share
in
these
transactions
then
this
hoopdriver
of
yours
roseate
idiot
that
he
is
is
in
illegal
possession
of
a
stolen
bicycle
a
stolen
young
lady
and
two
stolen
names
established
with
them
in
an
hotel
that
is
quite
beyond
his
means
and
immensely
proud
of
himself
in
a
somnolent
way
for
these
incomparable
follies
there
are
occasions
when
a
moralising
novelist
can
merely
wring
his
hands
and
leave
matters
to
take
their
course
for
all
hoopdriver
knows
or
cares
he
may
be
locked
up
the
very
first
thing
morning
for
the
rape
of
the
cycle
then
in
bognor
let
alone
that
melancholy
vestige
bechamel
with
whom
our
dealings
are
thank
goodness
over
there
is
a
coffee
tavern
with
a
steak
hoopdriver
ordered
done
to
a
cinder
long
ago
his
parcel
in
a
bedroom
and
his
own
proper
bicycle
by
way
of
guarantee
carefully
locked
up
in
the
hayloft
he
will
be
a
mystery
and
they
will
be
looking
for
his
body
along
the
sea
front
and
so
far
we
have
never
given
a
glance
at
the
desolate
home
in
surbiton
familiar
to
you
no
doubt
through
the
medium
of
illustrated
interviews
where
the
unhappy
stepmother
that
stepmother
it
must
be
explained
is
quite
well
known
to
you
that
is
a
little
surprise
i
have
prepared
for
you
she
is
plantagenet
the
gifted
authoress
of
that
witty
and
daring
book
soul
untrammelled
and
quite
an
excellent
woman
in
her
way
only
it
is
such
a
crooked
way
her
real
name
is
milton
she
is
a
widow
and
a
charming
one
only
ten
years
older
than
jessie
and
she
is
always
careful
to
dedicate
her
more
daring
works
to
the
memory
of
my
to
show
that
nothing
personal
you
know
in
the
matter
considering
her
literary
reputation
she
was
always
speaking
of
herself
as
one
i
martyred
for
truth
because
the
critics
advertised
her
written
indecorums
in
column
long
considering
her
literary
reputation
i
say
she
was
one
of
the
most
respectable
women
it
is
possible
to
imagine
she
furnished
correctly
dressed
correctly
had
severe
notions
of
whom
she
might
meet
went
to
church
and
even
at
times
took
the
sacrament
in
some
esoteric
spirit
and
jessie
she
brought
up
so
carefully
that
she
never
even
let
her
read
soul
which
therefore
naturally
enough
jessie
did
and
went
on
from
that
to
a
feast
of
advanced
literature
milton
not
only
brought
up
jessie
carefully
but
very
slowly
so
that
at
seventeen
she
was
still
a
clever
schoolgirl
as
you
have
seen
her
and
quite
in
the
background
of
the
little
literary
circle
of
unimportant
celebrities
which
adorned
milton
knew
reputation
of
being
a
dangerous
man
but
then
bad
men
are
not
bad
women
and
she
let
him
come
to
her
house
to
show
she
was
not
afraid
she
took
no
account
of
jessie
when
the
elopement
came
therefore
it
was
a
double
disappointment
to
her
for
she
perceived
his
hand
by
a
kind
of
instinct
she
did
the
correct
thing
the
correct
thing
as
you
know
is
to
take
hansom
cabs
regardless
of
expense
and
weep
and
say
you
do
not
know
what
to
do
round
the
circle
of
your
confidential
friends
she
could
not
have
ridden
nor
wept
more
had
jessie
been
her
own
daughter
she
showed
the
properest
spirit
and
she
not
only
showed
it
but
felt
it
milton
as
a
successful
little
authoress
and
still
more
successful
widow
of
plantagenet
is
a
charming
woman
her
reviewers
used
to
write
invariably
even
if
they
spoke
ill
of
her
found
the
steady
growth
of
jessie
into
womanhood
an
unmitigated
nuisance
and
had
been
willing
enough
to
keep
her
in
the
background
and
jessie
who
had
started
this
intercourse
at
fourteen
with
abstract
objections
to
stepmothers
had
been
active
enough
in
resenting
this
increasing
rivalry
and
antagonism
had
sprung
up
between
them
until
they
could
engender
quite
a
vivid
hatred
from
a
dropped
hairpin
or
the
cutting
of
a
book
with
a
sharpened
knife
there
is
very
little
deliberate
wickedness
in
the
world
the
stupidity
of
our
selfishness
gives
much
the
same
results
indeed
but
in
the
ethical
laboratory
it
shows
a
different
nature
and
when
the
disaster
came
remorse
for
their
gradual
loss
of
sympathy
and
her
share
in
the
losing
of
it
was
genuine
enough
you
may
imagine
the
comfort
she
got
from
her
friends
and
how
west
kensington
and
notting
hill
and
hampstead
the
literary
suburbs
those
decent
penitentiaries
of
a
once
bohemian
calling
hummed
with
the
business
her
as
a
charming
literary
lady
she
had
of
course
an
organised
corps
were
immensely
excited
and
were
sympathetic
helpfully
energetic
suggestive
alert
as
their
ideals
of
their
various
dispositions
required
them
to
be
news
of
jessie
was
the
pathetic
opening
of
a
dozen
melancholy
but
interesting
conversations
to
her
men
she
was
not
perhaps
so
damp
as
she
was
to
her
women
friends
but
in
a
quiet
way
she
was
even
more
touching
for
three
days
wednesday
that
is
thursday
and
friday
nothing
was
heard
of
the
fugitives
it
was
known
that
jessie
wearing
a
patent
costume
with
buttonup
skirts
and
mounted
on
a
diamond
frame
safety
with
dunlops
and
a
loofah
covered
saddle
had
ridden
forth
early
in
the
morning
taking
with
her
about
two
pounds
seven
shillings
in
money
and
a
grey
touring
case
packed
and
there
save
for
a
brief
note
to
her
stepmother
a
declaration
of
independence
it
was
said
an
assertion
of
her
ego
containing
extensive
and
very
annoying
quotations
from
soul
untrammelled
and
giving
no
definite
intimation
of
her
plans
knowledge
ceased
that
note
was
shown
to
few
and
then
only
in
the
strictest
confidence
but
on
friday
evening
late
came
a
breathless
man
friend
widgery
a
correspondent
of
hers
who
had
heard
of
her
trouble
among
the
first
he
had
been
touring
in
sussex
his
knapsack
was
still
on
his
back
and
he
testified
hurriedly
that
at
a
place
called
midhurst
in
the
bar
of
an
hotel
called
the
angel
he
had
heard
from
a
barmaid
a
vivid
account
of
a
young
lady
in
grey
descriptions
tallied
but
who
was
the
man
in
brown
poor
misguided
girl
i
must
go
to
her
at
once
she
said
choking
and
rising
with
her
hand
to
her
heart
impossible
there
are
no
more
trains
i
looked
on
my
love
she
said
bear
her
know
you
he
spoke
with
feeling
for
no
one
admired
his
photographs
of
scenery
more
than
milton
more
than
she
speak
unkindly
of
her
she
has
been
it
was
really
very
friendly
of
him
he
declared
he
was
only
sorry
his
news
ended
there
should
he
follow
them
and
bring
her
back
he
had
come
to
her
because
he
knew
of
her
anxiety
is
good
of
you
she
said
and
quite
instinctively
took
and
pressed
his
hand
to
think
of
that
poor
girl
tonight
she
looked
into
the
fire
that
she
had
lit
when
he
came
in
the
warm
light
fell
upon
her
dark
purple
dress
and
left
her
features
in
a
warm
shadow
she
looked
such
a
slight
frail
thing
to
be
troubled
so
must
follow
her
resolution
seemed
magnificent
have
no
one
to
go
with
must
marry
her
said
the
man
has
no
friends
we
have
no
one
after
all
two
so
and
this
little
figure
was
the
woman
that
people
who
knew
her
only
from
her
books
called
bold
prurient
even
simply
because
she
was
intellectual
he
was
overcome
by
the
unspeakable
pathos
of
her
position
milton
he
said
she
glanced
at
him
the
overflow
was
imminent
now
she
said
now
i
must
find
her
he
said
with
intense
emotion
he
was
one
of
those
big
fat
men
who
feel
deeply
let
me
help
you
at
least
let
me
help
can
you
spare
time
she
said
you
what
can
i
do
what
can
we
do
to
midhurst
follow
her
on
trace
her
she
was
there
on
thursday
night
last
night
she
cycled
out
of
the
town
courage
he
said
will
save
her
yet
she
put
out
her
hand
and
pressed
his
again
he
repeated
finding
it
so
well
received
there
were
alarms
and
excursions
without
she
turned
her
back
to
the
fire
and
he
sat
down
suddenly
in
the
big
armchair
which
suited
his
dimensions
admirably
then
the
door
opened
and
the
girl
showed
in
dangle
who
looked
curiously
from
one
to
the
other
there
was
emotion
here
he
had
heard
the
armchair
creaking
and
milton
whose
face
was
flushed
displayed
a
suspicious
alacrity
to
explain
too
she
said
one
of
my
good
friends
and
we
have
news
of
her
at
it
was
decidedly
an
advantage
to
widgery
but
dangle
determined
to
show
himself
a
man
of
resource
in
the
end
he
too
was
accepted
for
the
midhurst
expedition
to
the
intense
disgust
of
widgery
and
young
phipps
a
callow
youth
of
few
words
faultless
collars
and
fervent
devotion
was
also
enrolled
before
the
evening
was
out
they
would
scour
the
country
all
three
of
them
she
appeared
to
brighten
up
a
little
but
it
was
evident
she
was
profoundly
touched
she
did
not
know
what
she
had
done
to
merit
such
friends
her
voice
broke
a
little
she
moved
towards
the
door
and
young
phipps
who
was
a
youth
of
action
rather
than
of
words
sprang
and
opened
it
proud
to
be
first
is
sorely
troubled
said
dangle
to
widgery
must
do
what
we
can
for
is
a
wonderful
woman
said
dangle
subtle
so
intricate
so
many
faceted
she
feels
this
young
phipps
said
nothing
but
he
felt
the
more
and
yet
they
say
the
age
of
chivalry
is
dead
but
this
is
only
an
interlude
introduced
to
give
our
wanderers
time
to
refresh
themselves
by
good
honest
sleeping
for
the
present
therefore
we
will
not
concern
ourselves
with
the
starting
of
the
rescue
party
nor
with
simple
but
becoming
grey
dress
with
the
healthy
norfolk
jacket
and
thick
boots
with
the
slender
energetic
bearing
nor
with
the
wonderful
chequerings
that
set
off
the
legs
of
the
phipps
they
are
after
us
in
a
little
while
they
will
be
upon
us
you
must
imagine
as
you
best
can
the
competitive
raidings
at
midhurst
of
widgery
dangle
and
phipps
how
widgery
was
great
at
questions
and
dangle
good
at
inference
and
phipps
so
conspicuously
inferior
in
everything
that
he
felt
it
and
sulked
with
milton
most
of
the
day
after
the
manner
of
your
callow
youth
the
whole
world
over
milton
stopped
at
the
angel
and
was
very
sad
and
charming
and
intelligent
and
widgery
paid
the
bill
in
the
afternoon
of
saturday
chichester
was
attained
but
by
that
time
our
fugitives
as
you
shall
immediately
hear
xxvii
the
awakening
of
hoopdriver
hoopdriver
stirred
on
his
pillow
opened
his
eyes
and
staring
unmeaningly
yawned
the
bedclothes
were
soft
and
pleasant
he
turned
the
peaked
nose
that
overrides
the
insufficient
moustache
up
to
the
ceiling
a
pinkish
projection
over
the
billow
of
white
you
might
see
it
wrinkle
as
he
yawned
again
and
then
became
quiet
so
matters
remained
for
a
space
very
slowly
recollection
returned
to
him
then
a
shock
of
indeterminate
brown
hair
appeared
and
first
one
watery
grey
eye
and
then
two
the
bed
upheaved
and
you
had
him
his
thin
neck
projecting
abruptly
from
the
clothes
he
held
about
him
his
face
staring
about
the
room
he
held
the
clothes
about
him
i
hope
i
may
explain
because
his
was
at
bognor
in
an
packet
derelict
he
yawned
a
third
time
rubbed
his
eyes
smacked
his
lips
he
was
recalling
almost
everything
now
the
pursuit
the
hotel
the
tremulous
daring
of
his
entry
the
swift
adventure
of
the
inn
yard
the
moonlight
abruptly
he
threw
the
clothes
back
and
rose
into
a
sitting
position
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
without
was
the
noise
of
shutters
being
unfastened
and
doors
unlocked
and
the
passing
of
hoofs
and
wheels
in
the
street
he
looked
at
his
watch
six
he
surveyed
the
sumptuous
room
again
said
hoopdriver
a
dream
after
wonder
what
they
charge
for
these
juiced
rooms
said
hoopdriver
nursing
one
rosy
foot
he
became
meditative
tugging
at
his
insufficient
moustache
suddenly
he
gave
vent
to
a
noiseless
laugh
a
rush
it
was
rushed
in
and
off
with
his
girl
right
under
his
nose
planned
it
well
too
talk
of
highway
robbery
talk
of
brigands
up
and
off
how
juiced
sold
he
must
be
feeling
it
was
a
shave
too
in
the
coach
yard
suddenly
he
became
silent
abruptly
his
eyebrows
rose
and
his
jaw
fell
said
hoopdriver
he
had
never
thought
of
it
before
perhaps
you
will
understand
the
whirl
he
had
been
in
overnight
but
one
sees
things
clearer
in
the
daylight
hanged
if
i
been
and
stolen
a
blessed
cares
said
hoopdriver
presently
and
his
face
supplied
the
answer
then
he
thought
of
the
young
lady
in
grey
again
and
tried
to
put
a
more
heroic
complexion
on
the
business
but
of
an
early
morning
on
an
empty
stomach
as
with
characteristic
coarseness
medical
men
put
it
heroics
are
of
a
more
difficult
growth
than
by
moonlight
everything
had
seemed
exceptionally
fine
and
brilliant
but
quite
natural
the
evening
before
hoopdriver
reached
out
his
hand
took
his
norfolk
jacket
laid
it
over
his
knees
and
took
out
the
money
from
the
little
ticket
pocket
and
he
said
holding
the
coins
in
his
left
hand
and
stroking
his
chin
with
his
right
he
verified
by
patting
the
presence
of
a
pocketbook
in
the
breast
pocket
fourteen
said
hoopdriver
with
the
norfolk
jacket
still
on
his
knees
he
plunged
into
another
silent
meditation
matter
he
said
the
the
bother
good
going
back
to
bognor
send
it
back
by
carrier
of
course
thanking
him
for
the
loan
having
no
further
use
hoopdriver
chuckled
and
lapsed
into
the
silent
concoction
of
a
delightfully
impudent
letter
hoopdriver
presents
his
but
the
grave
note
reasserted
itself
trundle
back
there
in
an
hour
of
course
and
exchange
them
my
old
so
blessed
shabby
sure
to
be
spiteful
too
have
me
run
in
perhaps
then
be
in
just
the
same
old
fix
only
worse
you
see
her
it
complicates
things
his
eye
wandering
loosely
rested
on
the
sponge
bath
the
juice
do
they
want
with
cream
pans
in
a
bedroom
said
hoopdriver
en
passant
thing
we
can
do
is
to
set
out
of
here
as
soon
as
possible
anyhow
i
suppose
go
home
to
her
friends
that
bicycle
is
a
juicy
nuisance
anyhow
juicy
nuisance
he
jumped
to
his
feet
with
a
sudden
awakening
of
energy
to
proceed
with
his
toilet
then
with
a
certain
horror
he
remembered
that
the
simple
necessaries
of
that
process
were
at
bognor
he
remarked
and
whistled
silently
for
a
space
go
profit
and
loss
profit
one
sister
with
bicycle
complete
wot
offers
cheap
for
tooth
and
brush
vests
stockings
and
sundries
the
best
of
it
and
presently
when
it
came
to
he
had
to
smooth
his
troubled
locks
with
his
hands
it
was
a
poor
result
out
and
get
a
shave
i
suppose
and
buy
a
brush
and
so
on
chink
again
beard
show
he
ran
his
hand
over
his
chin
looked
at
himself
steadfastly
for
some
time
and
curled
his
insufficient
moustache
up
with
some
care
then
he
fell
on
his
beauty
he
considered
himself
face
left
and
right
an
expression
of
distaste
crept
over
his
features
alter
it
hoopdriver
he
remarked
a
weedy
customer
my
man
shoulders
narrow
skimpy
he
put
his
knuckles
on
the
toilet
table
and
regarded
himself
with
his
chin
lifted
in
the
air
lord
he
said
a
neck
wonder
why
i
got
such
a
thundering
lump
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
his
eye
still
on
the
glass
been
exercised
properly
if
been
fed
reasonable
if
i
been
shoved
out
of
a
silly
school
into
a
silly
shop
but
there
the
old
folks
know
no
better
the
schoolmaster
ought
to
have
but
he
poor
old
fool
still
when
it
comes
to
meeting
a
girl
like
this
wonder
what
think
of
me
as
a
specimen
civilisation
eigh
heir
of
the
ages
nothing
i
know
nothing
i
do
anything
sketch
a
bit
why
i
made
an
artist
cheap
after
all
this
suit
does
look
in
the
good
hoopdriver
anyhow
you
tell
yourself
any
lies
about
it
lovers
your
game
anyway
but
other
things
yet
you
can
help
the
young
lady
and
you
will
i
suppose
be
going
home
and
that
business
of
the
to
see
to
too
my
man
forward
hoopdriver
if
you
a
beauty
no
reason
why
you
should
stop
and
be
copped
is
it
and
having
got
back
in
this
way
to
a
gloomy
kind
of
he
had
another
attempt
at
his
hair
preparatory
to
leaving
his
room
and
hurrying
on
breakfast
for
an
early
departure
while
breakfast
was
preparing
he
wandered
out
into
south
street
and
refurnished
himself
with
the
elements
of
luggage
again
expense
to
be
spared
he
murmured
disgorging
the
xxviii
the
departure
from
chichester
he
caused
his
to
be
called
repeatedly
and
when
she
came
down
explained
with
a
humorous
smile
his
legal
relationship
to
the
bicycle
in
the
yard
be
disagreeable
his
anxiety
was
obvious
enough
well
she
said
quite
friendly
breakfast
and
ride
out
i
want
to
talk
things
over
with
the
girl
seemed
more
beautiful
than
ever
after
the
sleep
her
hair
in
comely
dark
waves
from
her
forehead
her
ungauntleted
pink
and
cool
and
how
decided
she
was
breakfast
was
a
nervous
ceremony
conversation
fraternal
but
thin
the
waiter
overawed
him
and
he
was
cowed
by
a
multiplicity
of
forks
but
she
called
him
they
discussed
their
route
over
his
sixpenny
county
map
for
the
sake
of
talking
but
avoided
a
decision
in
the
presence
of
the
attendant
the
note
was
changed
for
the
bill
and
through
determination
to
be
quite
the
gentleman
the
waiter
and
chambermaid
got
half
a
crown
each
and
the
ostler
a
florin
said
the
ostler
to
himself
without
gratitude
the
public
mounting
of
the
bicycles
in
the
street
was
a
moment
of
trepidation
a
policeman
actually
stopped
and
watched
them
from
the
opposite
kerb
suppose
him
to
come
across
and
ask
that
your
bicycle
sir
fight
or
drop
it
and
run
it
was
a
time
of
bewildering
apprehension
too
going
through
the
streets
of
the
town
so
that
a
milk
cart
barely
escaped
destruction
under
chancy
wheel
that
recalled
him
to
a
sense
of
erratic
steering
and
he
pulled
himself
together
in
the
lanes
he
breathed
freer
and
a
less
formal
conversation
presently
began
ridden
out
of
chichester
in
a
great
hurry
said
jessie
the
fact
of
it
is
worried
just
a
little
bit
about
this
course
she
said
had
forgotten
that
but
where
are
we
going
a
turning
or
two
more
if
you
mind
said
hoopdriver
a
mile
or
so
i
have
to
think
of
you
you
know
i
should
feel
more
easy
if
we
was
locked
up
you
know
not
that
i
should
mind
on
my
own
account
they
rode
with
a
streaky
grey
sea
coming
and
going
on
their
left
hand
every
mile
they
put
between
themselves
and
chichester
hoopdriver
felt
a
little
less
and
a
little
more
of
the
gallant
desperado
here
he
was
riding
on
a
splendid
machine
with
a
girl
beside
him
what
would
they
think
of
it
in
the
emporium
if
any
of
them
were
to
see
him
he
imagined
in
detail
the
astonishment
of
miss
isaacs
and
of
miss
howe
hoopdriver
miss
isaacs
would
say
emphatically
from
miss
howe
then
he
played
with
briggs
and
then
tried
the
in
a
shay
introducing
to
her
my
sister
pro
he
was
her
brother
chris
chris
what
confound
it
harringon
hartington
something
like
that
have
to
keep
off
that
topic
until
he
could
remember
wish
told
her
the
truth
now
almost
he
glanced
at
her
she
was
riding
with
her
eyes
straight
ahead
of
her
thinking
a
little
perplexed
perhaps
she
seemed
he
noticed
how
well
she
rode
and
that
she
rode
with
her
lips
closed
a
thing
he
could
never
manage
mind
came
round
to
the
future
what
was
she
going
to
do
what
were
they
both
going
to
do
his
thoughts
took
a
graver
colour
he
had
rescued
her
this
was
fine
manly
rescue
work
he
was
engaged
upon
she
ought
to
go
home
in
spite
of
that
stepmother
he
must
insist
gravely
but
firmly
upon
that
she
was
the
spirited
sort
of
course
but
still
wonder
if
she
had
any
money
wonder
what
the
fare
from
havant
to
london
is
of
course
he
would
have
to
pay
that
it
was
the
regular
thing
he
being
a
gentleman
then
should
he
take
her
home
he
began
to
rough
in
a
moving
sketch
of
the
return
the
stepmother
repentant
of
her
indescribable
cruelties
would
be
present
even
these
rich
people
have
their
troubles
probably
an
uncle
or
two
the
footman
would
announce
bother
that
name
and
miss
milton
then
two
women
weeping
together
and
a
knightly
figure
in
the
background
dressed
in
a
handsome
norfolk
jacket
still
conspicuously
new
he
would
conceal
his
feeling
until
the
very
end
then
leaving
he
would
pause
in
the
doorway
in
such
an
attitude
as
george
alexander
might
assume
and
say
slowly
and
dwindlingly
kind
to
her
be
kind
to
her
and
so
depart
heartbroken
to
the
meanest
intelligence
but
that
was
a
matter
for
the
future
he
would
have
to
begin
discussing
the
return
soon
there
was
no
traffic
along
the
road
and
he
came
up
beside
her
he
had
fallen
behind
in
his
musing
she
began
to
talk
denison
she
began
and
then
doubtfully
is
your
name
very
stupid
is
said
hoopdriver
denison
was
it
denison
denison
denison
what
was
she
saying
wonder
how
far
you
are
willing
to
help
me
confoundedly
hard
to
answer
a
question
like
that
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
without
steering
wildly
may
rely
said
hoopdriver
recovering
from
a
violent
wabble
can
assure
you
i
want
to
help
you
very
much
consider
me
at
all
leastways
consider
me
entirely
at
your
nuisance
not
to
be
able
to
say
this
kind
of
thing
right
see
i
am
so
awkwardly
i
can
only
help
you
you
will
make
me
very
happy
there
was
a
pause
round
a
bend
in
the
road
they
came
upon
a
grassy
space
between
hedge
and
road
set
with
yarrow
and
meadowsweet
where
a
felled
tree
lay
among
the
green
there
she
dismounted
and
propping
her
machine
against
a
stone
sat
down
we
can
talk
she
said
said
hoopdriver
expectant
she
answered
after
a
little
while
sitting
elbow
on
knee
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
and
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
know
i
am
resolved
to
live
my
own
course
said
hoopdriver
want
to
live
and
i
want
to
see
what
life
means
i
want
to
learn
everyone
is
hurrying
me
everything
is
hurrying
me
i
want
time
to
hoopdriver
was
puzzled
but
admiring
it
was
wonderful
how
clear
and
ready
her
words
were
but
then
one
might
speak
well
with
a
throat
and
lips
like
that
he
knew
he
was
inadequate
but
he
tried
to
meet
the
occasion
you
let
them
rush
you
into
anything
you
might
repent
of
of
course
be
very
you
want
to
learn
she
asked
was
wondering
only
this
morning
he
began
and
stopped
she
was
too
intent
upon
her
own
thoughts
to
notice
this
insufficiency
find
myself
in
life
and
it
terrifies
me
i
seem
to
be
like
a
little
speck
whirling
on
a
wheel
suddenly
caught
up
am
i
here
for
i
ask
simply
to
be
here
at
a
time
i
asked
it
a
week
ago
i
asked
it
yesterday
and
i
ask
it
and
little
things
happen
and
the
days
pass
my
stepmother
takes
me
shopping
people
come
to
tea
there
is
a
new
play
to
pass
the
time
or
a
concert
or
a
novel
the
wheels
of
the
world
go
on
turning
turning
it
is
horrible
i
want
to
do
a
miracle
like
joshua
and
stop
the
whirl
until
i
have
fought
it
out
at
home
hoopdriver
stroked
his
moustache
is
so
he
said
in
a
meditative
tone
will
go
on
he
said
the
faint
breath
of
summer
stirred
the
trees
and
a
bunch
of
dandelion
puff
lifted
among
the
meadowsweet
and
struck
and
broke
into
a
dozen
separate
threads
against
his
knee
they
flew
on
apart
and
sank
as
the
breeze
fell
among
the
grass
some
to
germinate
some
to
perish
his
eye
followed
them
until
they
had
vanished
go
back
to
surbiton
said
the
young
lady
in
grey
said
hoopdriver
catching
at
his
moustache
this
was
an
unexpected
development
want
to
write
you
see
said
the
young
lady
in
grey
write
books
and
alter
things
to
do
good
i
want
to
lead
a
free
life
and
own
myself
i
go
back
i
want
to
obtain
a
position
as
a
journalist
i
have
been
told
but
i
know
no
one
to
help
me
at
once
no
one
that
i
could
go
to
there
is
one
person
she
was
a
mistress
at
my
school
if
i
could
write
to
her
but
then
how
could
i
get
her
answer
said
hoopdriver
very
grave
trouble
you
much
more
you
have
come
you
have
risked
things
count
said
hoopdriver
double
pay
to
let
me
do
it
so
to
is
good
of
you
to
say
that
surbiton
is
so
conventional
i
am
resolved
to
be
unconventional
at
any
cost
but
we
are
so
hampered
if
i
could
only
burgeon
out
of
all
that
hinders
me
i
want
to
struggle
to
take
my
place
in
the
world
i
want
to
be
my
own
mistress
to
shape
my
own
career
but
my
stepmother
objects
so
she
does
as
she
likes
herself
and
is
strict
with
me
to
ease
her
conscience
and
if
i
go
back
now
go
back
owning
myself
beaten
she
left
the
rest
to
his
imagination
see
that
agreed
hoopdriver
he
must
help
her
within
his
skull
he
was
doing
some
intricate
arithmetic
with
five
pounds
six
and
twopence
in
some
vague
way
he
inferred
from
all
this
that
jessie
was
trying
to
escape
from
an
undesirable
marriage
but
was
saying
these
things
out
of
modesty
his
circle
of
ideas
was
so
limited
know
forgotten
your
name
hoopdriver
seemed
lost
in
abstraction
go
back
of
course
quite
like
that
he
said
thoughtfully
his
ears
waxed
suddenly
red
and
his
cheeks
flushed
what
is
your
name
said
hoopdriver
benson
of
benson
yes
really
very
stupid
of
me
but
i
can
never
remember
names
i
must
make
a
note
on
my
she
clicked
a
little
silver
pencil
and
wrote
the
name
down
i
could
write
to
my
friend
i
believe
she
would
be
able
to
help
me
to
an
independent
life
i
could
write
to
her
or
telegraph
write
i
think
i
could
scarcely
explain
in
a
telegram
i
know
she
would
help
clearly
there
was
only
one
course
open
to
a
gentleman
under
the
circumstances
that
case
said
hoopdriver
you
mind
trusting
yourself
to
a
stranger
we
might
continue
as
we
are
perhaps
for
a
day
or
so
until
you
suppose
thirty
shillings
a
day
that
gives
four
days
say
four
thirties
is
and
twenty
six
quid
well
three
days
say
four
ten
are
very
good
to
his
expression
was
eloquent
well
then
and
thank
you
wonderful
more
than
i
deserve
that
you
she
dropped
the
theme
abruptly
was
our
bill
at
chichester
said
hoopdriver
feigning
a
certain
stupidity
there
was
a
brief
discussion
secretly
he
was
delighted
at
her
insistence
in
paying
she
carried
her
point
their
talk
came
round
to
their
immediate
plans
for
the
day
they
decided
to
ride
easily
through
havant
and
stop
perhaps
at
fareham
or
southampton
for
the
previous
day
had
tried
them
both
holding
the
map
extended
on
his
knee
eye
fell
by
chance
on
the
bicycle
at
his
feet
bicycle
he
remarked
quite
irrelevantly
look
the
same
machine
if
i
got
a
big
double
elarum
instead
of
that
little
a
a
pause
well
then
havant
and
lunch
said
jessie
rising
wish
somehow
we
could
have
managed
it
without
stealing
that
machine
said
hoopdriver
it
is
stealing
it
you
know
come
to
think
of
if
bechamel
troubles
you
i
will
tell
the
whole
world
if
need
believe
you
would
said
hoopdriver
admiring
her
plucky
enough
goodness
discovering
suddenly
that
she
was
standing
he
too
rose
and
picked
up
her
machine
she
took
it
and
wheeled
it
into
the
road
then
he
took
his
own
he
paused
regarding
it
say
said
he
this
bike
look
now
if
it
was
enamelled
grey
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
his
grave
face
try
and
hide
it
in
that
way
was
jest
a
passing
thought
said
hoopdriver
airily
mean
anything
you
as
they
were
riding
on
to
havant
it
occurred
to
hoopdriver
in
a
transitory
manner
that
the
interview
had
been
quite
other
than
his
expectation
but
that
was
the
way
with
everything
in
experience
and
though
his
wisdom
looked
grave
within
him
and
caution
was
chinking
coins
and
an
ancient
prejudice
in
favour
of
property
shook
her
head
something
else
was
there
too
shouting
in
his
mind
to
drown
all
these
saner
considerations
the
intoxicating
thought
of
riding
beside
her
all
all
perhaps
for
other
days
after
that
of
talking
to
her
familiarly
being
brother
of
all
her
slender
strength
and
freshness
of
having
a
golden
real
and
wonderful
time
beyond
all
his
imaginings
his
old
familiar
fancyings
gave
place
to
anticipations
as
impalpable
and
fluctuating
and
beautiful
as
the
sunset
of
a
summer
day
at
havant
he
took
an
opportunity
to
purchase
at
small
in
the
main
street
a
toothbrush
a
pair
of
nail
scissors
and
a
little
bottle
of
stuff
to
darken
the
moustache
an
article
the
shopman
introduced
to
his
attention
recommended
highly
and
sold
in
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
xxix
the
unexpected
anecdote
of
the
lion
they
rode
on
to
cosham
and
lunched
lightly
but
expensively
there
jessie
went
out
and
posted
her
letter
to
her
school
friend
then
the
green
height
of
portsdown
hill
tempted
them
and
leaving
their
machines
in
the
village
they
clambered
up
the
slope
to
the
silent
fort
that
crowned
it
thence
they
had
a
view
of
portsmouth
and
its
cluster
of
sister
towns
the
crowded
narrows
of
the
harbour
the
solent
and
the
isle
of
wight
like
a
blue
cloud
through
the
hot
haze
jessie
by
some
miracle
had
become
a
skirted
woman
in
the
cosham
inn
hoopdriver
lounged
gracefully
on
the
turf
smoked
a
red
herring
cigarette
and
lazily
regarded
the
fortified
towns
that
spread
like
a
map
away
there
the
inner
line
of
defence
like
toy
fortifications
a
mile
off
perhaps
and
beyond
that
a
few
little
fields
and
then
the
beginnings
of
landport
suburb
and
the
smoky
cluster
of
the
multitudinous
houses
to
the
right
at
the
head
of
the
harbour
shallows
the
town
of
porchester
rose
among
the
trees
anxiety
receded
to
some
remote
corner
of
his
brain
and
that
florid
imagination
of
his
shared
the
stage
with
the
image
of
jessie
he
began
to
speculate
on
the
impression
he
was
creating
he
took
stock
of
his
suit
in
a
more
optimistic
spirit
and
reviewed
with
some
complacency
his
actions
for
the
last
four
and
twenty
hours
then
he
was
dashed
at
the
thought
of
her
infinite
perfections
she
had
been
observing
him
quietly
rather
more
closely
during
the
last
hour
or
so
she
did
not
look
at
him
directly
because
he
seemed
always
looking
at
her
her
own
troubles
had
quieted
down
a
little
and
her
curiosity
about
the
chivalrous
worshipping
but
singular
gentleman
in
brown
was
awakening
she
had
recalled
too
the
curious
incident
of
their
first
encounter
she
found
him
hard
to
explain
to
herself
you
must
understand
that
her
knowledge
of
the
world
was
rather
less
than
nothing
having
been
obtained
entirely
from
books
you
must
not
take
a
certain
ignorance
for
foolishness
she
had
begun
with
a
few
experiments
he
did
not
know
french
except
play
a
phrase
he
seemed
to
regard
as
a
very
good
light
table
joke
in
itself
his
english
was
uncertain
but
not
such
as
books
informed
her
distinguished
the
lower
classes
his
manners
seemed
to
her
good
on
the
whole
but
a
trifle
and
out
of
fashion
he
called
her
i
once
he
seemed
a
person
of
means
and
leisure
but
he
knew
nothing
of
recent
concerts
theatres
or
books
how
did
he
spend
his
time
he
was
certainly
chivalrous
and
a
trifle
simpleminded
she
fancied
so
much
is
there
in
a
change
of
costume
that
she
had
never
met
with
such
a
man
before
what
could
he
be
benson
she
said
breaking
a
silence
devoted
to
landscape
he
rolled
over
and
regarded
her
chin
on
knuckles
your
you
paint
are
you
an
artist
judicious
pause
should
hardly
call
myself
a
nartist
you
know
i
do
paint
a
little
and
sketch
you
know
skitty
kind
of
he
plucked
and
began
to
nibble
a
blade
of
grass
it
was
really
not
so
much
lying
as
his
quick
imagination
that
prompted
him
to
add
papers
you
know
and
all
see
said
jessie
looking
at
him
thoughtfully
artists
were
a
very
heterogeneous
class
certainly
and
geniuses
had
a
trick
of
being
a
little
odd
he
avoided
her
eye
and
bit
his
grass
do
much
you
not
your
profession
no
said
hoopdriver
anxious
now
to
hedge
make
a
regular
thing
of
it
you
know
jest
now
and
then
something
comes
into
my
head
and
down
it
goes
no
not
a
regular
you
practise
any
regular
profession
hoopdriver
looked
into
her
eyes
and
saw
their
quiet
unsuspicious
regard
he
had
vague
ideas
of
resuming
the
detective
role
like
this
he
said
to
gain
time
have
a
sort
of
profession
only
a
kind
of
reason
nothing
much
you
beg
your
pardon
for
trouble
said
hoopdriver
i
very
well
i
leave
it
to
you
you
know
i
want
to
make
any
mystery
of
it
so
far
as
that
should
he
plunge
boldly
and
be
a
barrister
that
anyhow
was
something
pretty
good
but
she
might
know
about
barristry
think
i
could
guess
what
you
guess
said
hoopdriver
come
from
one
of
the
colonies
me
said
hoopdriver
veering
round
to
the
new
wind
did
you
find
out
that
the
man
was
born
in
a
london
suburb
dear
reader
guessed
she
said
he
lifted
his
eyebrows
as
one
astonished
and
clutched
a
new
piece
of
grass
were
educated
up
again
said
hoopdriver
rolling
over
again
into
her
elbow
a
clairvoy
he
bit
at
the
grass
smiling
colony
was
it
i
must
guess
said
hoopdriver
africa
she
said
strongly
incline
to
south
quite
a
large
place
he
said
south
africa
is
right
warm
said
hoopdriver
and
the
while
his
imagination
was
eagerly
exploring
this
new
province
africa
is
right
she
insisted
he
turned
over
again
and
nodded
smiling
reassuringly
into
her
eyes
made
me
think
of
south
africa
was
that
novel
of
olive
you
know
story
of
an
african
gregory
rose
is
so
like
never
read
story
of
an
african
farm
said
hoopdriver
must
he
like
must
read
the
book
but
a
wonderful
place
with
its
mixture
of
races
and
its
civilisation
jostling
the
old
savagery
were
you
near
khama
was
a
long
way
off
from
our
place
said
hoopdriver
had
a
little
ostrich
farm
you
know
just
a
few
hundred
of
out
johannesburg
the
karroo
was
it
called
the
term
some
of
it
was
freehold
though
luckily
we
got
along
very
well
in
the
old
but
no
ostriches
on
that
farm
he
had
a
diamond
mine
in
his
head
just
at
the
moment
but
he
stopped
and
left
a
little
to
the
imagination
besides
which
it
had
occurred
to
him
with
a
kind
of
shock
that
he
was
lying
became
of
the
ostriches
sold
off
when
we
parted
with
the
farm
do
you
mind
if
i
have
another
cigarette
that
was
when
i
was
quite
a
little
chap
you
know
that
we
had
this
ostrich
you
have
blacks
and
boers
about
you
said
hoopdriver
striking
a
match
on
his
instep
and
beginning
to
feel
hot
at
the
new
responsibility
he
had
brought
upon
himself
interesting
do
you
know
never
been
out
of
england
except
to
paris
and
mentone
and
gets
tired
of
travelling
puff
after
a
bit
of
must
tell
me
about
your
farm
in
south
africa
it
always
stimulates
my
imagination
to
think
of
these
places
i
can
fancy
all
the
tall
ostriches
being
driven
out
by
a
black
herd
to
graze
i
suppose
how
do
ostriches
feed
said
hoopdriver
rather
various
they
have
their
fancies
you
know
fruit
of
course
and
that
kind
of
thing
and
chicken
food
and
so
forth
you
have
to
use
you
ever
see
a
lion
very
common
in
our
district
said
hoopdriver
quite
modestly
seen
them
of
course
once
or
seeing
a
lion
you
frightened
hoopdriver
was
now
thoroughly
sorry
he
had
accepted
that
offer
of
south
africa
he
puffed
his
cigarette
and
regarded
the
solent
languidly
as
he
settled
the
fate
on
that
lion
in
his
mind
scarcely
had
time
he
said
all
happened
in
a
on
she
said
was
going
across
the
inner
paddock
where
the
fatted
ostriches
you
eat
ostriches
then
i
did
not
know
them
often
very
nice
they
are
too
properly
stuffed
well
we
i
rather
was
going
across
this
paddock
and
i
saw
something
standing
up
in
the
moonlight
and
looking
at
hoopdriver
was
in
a
hot
perspiration
now
his
invention
seemed
to
have
gone
limp
i
had
my
gun
with
me
i
was
scared
though
i
can
tell
you
puff
i
just
aimed
at
the
end
that
i
thought
was
the
head
and
let
fly
puff
and
over
it
went
you
dead
it
was
one
of
the
luckiest
shots
i
ever
fired
and
i
much
over
nine
at
the
time
should
have
screamed
and
run
some
things
you
run
away
from
said
hoopdriver
run
would
have
been
think
i
ever
met
a
before
she
remarked
evidently
with
a
heightened
opinion
of
him
there
was
a
pause
she
seemed
meditating
further
questions
hoopdriver
drew
his
watch
hastily
say
said
hoopdriver
showing
it
to
her
you
think
we
ought
to
be
getting
on
his
face
was
flushed
his
ears
bright
red
she
ascribed
his
confusion
to
modesty
he
rose
with
a
lion
added
to
the
burthens
of
his
conscience
and
held
out
his
hand
to
assist
her
they
walked
down
into
cosham
again
resumed
their
machines
and
went
on
at
a
leisurely
pace
along
the
northern
shore
of
the
big
harbour
but
hoopdriver
was
no
longer
happy
this
horrible
this
fulsome
lie
stuck
in
his
memory
why
had
he
done
it
she
did
not
ask
for
any
more
south
african
stories
happily
at
least
until
porchester
was
reached
but
talked
instead
of
living
own
life
and
how
custom
hung
on
people
like
chains
she
talked
wonderfully
and
set
mind
fermenting
by
the
castle
hoopdriver
caught
several
crabs
in
little
shore
pools
at
fareham
they
stopped
for
a
second
tea
and
left
the
place
towards
the
hour
of
sunset
under
such
invigorating
circumstances
as
you
shall
in
due
course
hear
xxx
the
rescue
expedition
and
now
to
tell
of
those
energetic
chevaliers
widgery
dangle
and
phipps
and
of
that
distressed
beauty
plantagenet
well
known
in
society
so
the
paragraphs
said
as
milton
we
left
them
at
midhurst
station
if
i
remember
rightly
waiting
in
a
state
of
fine
emotion
for
the
chichester
train
it
was
clearly
understood
by
the
entire
rescue
party
that
milton
was
bearing
up
bravely
against
almost
overwhelming
grief
the
three
gentlemen
outdid
one
another
in
sympathetic
expedients
they
watched
her
gravely
almost
tenderly
the
substantial
widgery
tugged
at
his
moustache
and
looked
his
unspeakable
feelings
at
her
with
those
brown
eyes
of
his
the
slender
dangle
tugged
at
his
moustache
and
did
what
he
could
with
unsympathetic
grey
ones
phipps
unhappily
had
no
moustache
to
run
any
risks
with
so
he
folded
his
arms
and
talked
in
a
brave
indifferent
tone
about
the
london
brighton
and
south
coast
railway
just
to
cheer
the
poor
woman
up
a
little
and
even
milton
really
felt
that
exalted
melancholy
to
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
and
tried
to
show
it
in
a
dozen
little
delicate
feminine
ways
is
nothing
to
do
until
we
get
to
chichester
said
dangle
said
widgery
and
aside
in
her
ear
really
ate
scarcely
anything
you
trains
are
always
late
said
phipps
with
his
fingers
along
the
edge
of
his
collar
dangle
you
must
understand
was
a
and
reviewer
and
his
pride
was
to
be
thomas
intellectual
companion
widgery
the
big
man
was
manager
of
a
bank
and
a
mighty
golfer
and
his
conception
of
his
relations
to
her
never
came
into
his
mind
without
those
charming
oldlines
douglas
tender
and
true
falling
hard
upon
its
heels
his
name
was
widgery
and
phipps
phipps
was
a
medical
student
still
and
he
felt
that
he
laid
his
heart
at
her
feet
the
heart
of
a
man
of
the
world
she
was
kind
to
them
all
in
her
way
and
insisted
on
their
being
friends
together
in
spite
of
a
disposition
to
reciprocal
criticism
they
displayed
dangle
thought
widgery
a
philistine
appreciating
but
coarsely
the
merits
of
soul
untrammelled
and
widgery
thought
dangle
lacked
humanity
would
talk
insincerely
to
say
a
clever
thing
both
dangle
and
widgery
thought
phipps
a
bit
of
a
cub
and
phipps
thought
both
dangle
and
widgery
a
couple
of
thundering
bounders
would
have
got
to
chichester
in
time
for
lunch
said
dangle
in
the
train
perhaps
and
no
sufficient
place
in
the
road
so
soon
as
we
get
there
phipps
must
inquire
at
the
chief
hotels
to
see
if
any
one
answering
to
her
description
has
lunched
inquire
said
phipps
i
suppose
you
and
widgery
will
just
hang
about
he
saw
an
expression
of
pain
on
gentle
face
and
stopped
abruptly
said
dangle
hang
about
as
you
put
it
there
are
two
places
in
chichester
where
tourists
might
go
the
cathedral
and
a
remarkably
fine
museum
i
shall
go
to
the
cathedral
and
make
an
inquiry
or
so
while
widgery
museum
very
well
and
after
that
a
little
thing
or
two
thought
of
myself
said
widgery
to
begin
with
they
took
milton
in
a
kind
of
procession
to
the
red
hotel
and
established
her
there
with
some
tea
are
so
kind
to
me
she
said
of
they
signified
that
it
was
nothing
and
dispersed
to
their
inquiries
by
six
they
returned
their
zeal
a
little
damped
without
news
widgery
came
back
with
dangle
phipps
was
the
last
to
return
quite
sure
said
widgery
there
any
flaw
in
that
inference
of
yours
said
dangle
rather
shortly
course
said
widgery
starting
from
midhurst
on
the
chichester
road
absolutely
bind
them
not
to
change
their
dear
fellow
it
does
really
it
does
you
must
allow
me
to
have
enough
intelligence
to
think
of
really
you
must
there
any
to
tempt
them
would
they
turn
aside
here
no
would
they
turn
there
many
more
things
are
inevitable
than
you
shall
see
at
once
said
widgery
at
the
window
comes
phipps
for
my
own
part
said
milton
he
hurrying
does
he
look
she
rose
in
her
eagerness
biting
her
trembling
lip
and
went
towards
the
window
news
said
phipps
entering
said
widgery
said
dangle
said
phipps
fellow
had
got
hold
of
a
queer
story
of
a
man
in
bicycling
clothes
who
was
asking
the
same
question
about
this
time
question
said
milton
in
the
shadow
of
the
window
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
almost
a
whisper
have
you
seen
a
young
lady
in
a
grey
bicycling
costume
dangle
caught
at
his
lower
lip
that
he
said
a
man
asking
after
her
then
what
can
that
mean
knows
said
phipps
sitting
down
wearily
better
kind
of
man
said
dangle
should
i
know
in
bicycling
costume
the
fellow
what
height
what
complexion
ask
said
phipps
ask
nonsense
said
dangle
him
yourself
said
phipps
an
ostler
chap
in
the
white
hart
short
fellow
with
a
red
face
and
a
crusty
manner
leaning
up
against
the
stable
door
smells
of
whiskey
go
and
ask
course
said
dangle
taking
his
straw
hat
from
the
shade
over
the
stuffed
bird
on
the
chiffonier
and
turning
towards
the
door
might
have
mouth
opened
and
shut
tired
sure
phipps
said
the
lady
soothingly
me
ring
for
some
tea
for
it
suddenly
occurred
to
phipps
that
he
had
lapsed
a
little
from
his
chivalry
was
a
little
annoyed
at
the
way
he
rushed
me
to
do
all
this
business
he
said
do
a
hundred
times
as
much
if
it
would
bring
you
any
nearer
to
pause
would
like
a
little
want
to
raise
any
false
hopes
said
widgery
i
do
not
believe
they
even
came
to
chichester
a
very
clever
fellow
of
course
but
sometimes
these
inferences
of
his
said
phipps
suddenly
is
it
said
milton
forgotten
i
went
right
out
from
here
went
to
every
other
hotel
in
the
place
and
never
thought
but
never
mind
ask
when
the
waiter
mean
a
tap
and
the
door
opened
yes
said
the
waiter
minute
said
phipps
a
lady
in
grey
a
cycling
lady
here
yesterday
yessir
stopped
the
night
with
her
brother
sir
a
young
said
milton
in
a
low
tone
god
the
waiter
glanced
at
her
and
understood
everything
young
gent
sir
he
said
free
with
his
money
give
the
name
of
he
proceeded
to
some
rambling
particulars
and
was
by
widgery
on
the
plans
of
the
young
couple
havant
said
phipps
seem
to
remember
it
the
man
tall
said
milton
intently
looking
with
a
long
flaxen
moustache
and
spoke
with
a
drawl
said
the
waiter
and
thought
moustache
was
scarcely
long
scrubby
more
and
young
he
was
more
like
five
and
twenty
not
me
said
milton
speaking
in
a
curious
hollow
voice
fumbling
for
her
salts
and
showing
the
finest
must
have
been
her
younger
brother
must
have
will
do
thank
you
said
widgery
officiously
feeling
that
she
would
be
easier
under
this
new
surprise
if
the
man
were
dismissed
the
waiter
turned
to
go
and
almost
collided
with
dangle
who
was
entering
the
room
panting
excitedly
and
with
a
pocket
handkerchief
held
to
his
right
eye
said
dangle
up
up
with
you
said
phipps
an
altercation
merely
with
that
drunken
ostler
of
yours
he
thought
it
was
a
plot
to
annoy
him
that
the
young
lady
in
grey
was
mythical
judged
from
your
manner
got
a
piece
of
raw
meat
to
keep
over
it
you
have
some
news
i
see
the
man
hit
you
asked
widgery
milton
rose
and
approached
dangle
can
not
i
do
anything
dangle
was
heroic
tell
me
your
news
he
said
round
the
corner
of
the
handkerchief
was
in
this
way
said
phipps
and
explained
rather
sheepishly
while
he
was
doing
so
with
a
running
fire
of
commentary
from
widgery
the
waiter
brought
in
a
tray
of
tea
time
table
said
dangle
promptly
milton
poured
two
cups
and
phipps
and
dangle
partook
in
passover
form
they
caught
the
train
by
a
breadth
so
to
havant
and
inquiries
dangle
was
puffed
up
to
find
that
his
guess
of
havant
was
right
in
view
of
the
fact
that
beyond
havant
the
southampton
road
has
a
steep
hill
continuously
on
the
side
and
the
sea
on
the
left
he
hit
upon
a
magnificent
scheme
for
heading
the
young
folks
off
he
and
milton
would
go
to
fareham
widgery
and
phipps
should
alight
one
each
at
the
intermediate
stations
of
cosham
and
porchester
and
come
on
by
the
next
train
if
they
had
no
news
if
they
did
not
come
on
a
wire
to
the
fareham
post
office
was
to
explain
why
it
was
napoleonic
and
more
than
consoled
dangle
for
the
open
derision
of
the
havant
street
boys
at
the
handkerchief
which
still
protected
his
damaged
eye
moreover
the
scheme
answered
to
perfection
the
fugitives
escaped
by
a
breadth
they
were
outside
the
golden
anchor
at
fareham
and
preparing
to
mount
as
milton
and
dangle
came
round
the
corner
from
the
station
her
said
milton
and
would
have
screamed
said
dangle
gripping
the
arm
removing
his
handkerchief
in
his
excitement
and
leaving
the
piece
of
meat
over
his
eye
an
extraordinary
appearance
which
seemed
unexpectedly
to
calm
her
cool
said
dangle
glaring
under
the
meat
must
not
see
us
they
will
get
away
else
were
there
flys
at
the
station
the
young
couple
mounted
and
vanished
round
the
corner
of
the
winchester
road
had
it
not
been
for
the
publicity
of
the
business
milton
would
have
fainted
her
she
said
a
conveyance
said
dangle
he
left
her
in
a
most
pathetic
attitude
with
her
hand
pressed
to
her
heart
and
rushed
into
the
golden
anchor
dog
cart
in
ten
minutes
emerged
the
meat
had
gone
now
and
one
saw
the
cooling
puffiness
over
his
eye
will
conduct
you
back
to
the
station
said
dangle
back
here
and
pursue
them
you
will
meet
widgery
and
phipps
and
tell
them
i
am
in
she
was
whirled
back
to
the
railway
station
and
left
there
on
a
hard
blistered
wooden
seat
in
the
sun
she
felt
tired
and
dreadfully
ruffled
and
agitated
and
dusty
dangle
was
no
doubt
most
energetic
and
devoted
but
for
a
kindly
helpful
manner
commend
her
to
douglas
widgery
meanwhile
dangle
his
face
golden
in
the
evening
sun
was
driving
as
well
as
he
could
a
large
black
horse
harnessed
into
a
thing
called
a
gig
northwestward
towards
winchester
dangle
barring
his
swollen
eye
was
a
little
man
and
he
wore
a
deerstalker
cap
and
was
dressed
in
dark
grey
his
neck
was
long
and
slender
perhaps
you
know
what
gigs
are
huge
big
wooden
things
and
very
high
and
the
horse
too
was
huge
and
big
and
high
with
knobby
legs
a
long
face
a
hard
mouth
and
a
whacking
trick
of
pacing
smack
smack
smack
smack
it
went
along
the
road
and
hard
by
the
church
it
shied
vigorously
at
a
hooded
perambulator
the
history
of
the
rescue
expedition
now
becomes
confused
it
appears
that
widgery
was
extremely
indignant
to
find
milton
left
about
upon
the
fareham
platform
the
day
had
irritated
him
somehow
though
he
had
started
with
the
noblest
intentions
and
he
seemed
glad
to
find
an
outlet
for
justifiable
indignation
such
a
spasmodic
creature
said
widgery
off
and
i
suppose
to
wait
here
until
he
comes
back
likely
so
egotistical
is
dangle
always
wants
to
mismanage
everything
means
to
help
me
said
milton
a
little
reproachfully
touching
his
arm
widgery
was
hardly
in
the
mood
to
be
mollified
all
at
once
need
not
prevent
me
he
said
and
stopped
no
good
talking
you
know
and
you
are
can
go
on
she
said
brightly
only
we
find
i
was
cooling
my
heels
in
cosham
i
bought
a
county
he
produced
and
opened
it
you
see
is
the
road
out
of
he
proceeded
with
the
calm
deliberation
of
a
business
man
to
develop
a
proposal
of
taking
train
forthwith
to
winchester
must
be
going
to
winchester
he
explained
it
was
inevitable
sunday
winchester
a
cathedral
town
road
going
nowhere
else
of
the
slightest
importance
dangle
will
simply
go
on
until
he
has
to
pass
something
and
then
he
will
break
his
neck
i
have
seen
dangle
drive
before
scarcely
likely
a
especially
a
hired
will
overtake
bicycles
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
rely
upon
me
milton
am
in
your
hands
she
said
with
pathetic
littleness
looking
up
at
him
and
for
the
moment
he
forgot
the
exasperation
of
the
day
phipps
during
this
conversation
had
stood
in
a
somewhat
depressed
attitude
leaning
on
his
stick
feeling
his
collar
and
looking
from
one
speaker
to
the
other
the
idea
of
leaving
dangle
behind
seemed
to
him
an
excellent
one
might
leave
a
message
at
the
place
where
he
got
the
he
suggested
when
he
saw
their
eyes
meeting
there
was
a
cheerful
alacrity
about
all
three
at
the
proposal
but
they
never
got
beyond
botley
for
even
as
their
train
ran
into
the
station
a
mighty
rumbling
was
heard
there
was
a
shouting
overhead
the
guard
stood
astonished
on
the
platform
and
phipps
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
window
cried
he
goes
and
sprang
out
of
the
carriage
milton
following
in
alarm
just
saw
it
from
widgery
it
was
hidden
botley
station
lies
in
a
cutting
overhead
was
the
roadway
and
across
the
lemon
yellows
and
flushed
pinks
of
the
sunset
there
whirled
a
great
black
mass
a
horse
like
a
chess
knight
the
upper
works
of
a
gig
and
dangle
in
transit
from
front
to
back
a
monstrous
shadow
aped
him
across
the
cutting
it
was
the
event
of
a
second
dangle
seemed
to
jump
hang
in
the
air
momentarily
and
vanish
and
after
a
pause
came
a
smash
then
two
black
heads
running
swiftly
get
out
said
phipps
to
milton
who
stood
fascinated
in
the
doorway
in
another
moment
all
three
were
hurrying
up
the
steps
they
found
dangle
hatless
standing
up
with
cut
hands
extended
having
his
hands
brushed
by
an
officious
small
boy
a
broad
ugly
road
ran
downhill
in
a
long
vista
and
in
the
distance
was
a
little
group
of
botley
inhabitants
holding
the
big
black
horse
even
at
that
distance
they
could
see
the
expression
of
conscious
pride
on
the
visage
it
was
as
a
horse
as
you
can
imagine
the
beasts
in
the
tower
of
london
on
which
the
men
in
armour
are
perched
are
the
only
horses
i
have
ever
seen
at
all
like
it
however
we
are
not
concerned
now
with
the
horse
but
with
dangle
asked
phipps
eagerly
leading
dangle
cried
milton
clasping
her
hands
said
dangle
not
surprised
in
the
slightest
come
i
may
want
you
bit
of
a
mess
in
eigh
but
caught
at
the
very
place
i
expected
them
said
widgery
are
they
there
he
said
with
a
backward
motion
of
his
head
a
mile
up
the
hill
i
left
i
had
understand
said
milton
with
that
rapt
painful
look
again
you
found
jessie
have
i
wish
i
could
wash
the
gravel
out
of
my
hands
somewhere
it
was
like
this
you
know
came
on
them
suddenly
round
a
corner
horse
shied
at
the
bicycles
they
were
sitting
by
the
roadside
botanising
flowers
i
just
had
time
to
shout
milton
been
looking
for
you
and
then
that
confounded
brute
bolted
i
dare
turn
round
i
had
all
my
work
to
do
to
save
myself
being
turned
over
as
it
was
so
long
as
i
did
i
mean
i
just
shouted
to
your
friends
all
will
be
and
off
i
came
clatter
clatter
whether
they
heard
me
to
her
said
milton
with
intensity
turning
towards
widgery
said
widgery
suddenly
becoming
active
far
is
it
dangle
and
a
half
or
two
miles
i
was
determined
to
find
them
you
know
i
say
though
look
at
my
hands
but
i
beg
your
pardon
he
turned
to
phipps
i
say
where
shall
i
wash
the
gravel
out
and
have
a
look
at
my
knee
the
station
said
phipps
becoming
helpful
dangle
made
a
step
and
a
damaged
knee
became
evident
my
arm
said
phipps
can
we
get
a
conveyance
asked
widgery
of
two
small
boys
the
two
small
boys
failed
to
understand
they
looked
at
one
another
not
a
cab
not
a
in
sight
said
widgery
a
case
of
a
horse
a
horse
my
kingdom
for
a
a
harse
all
right
said
one
of
the
small
boys
with
a
movement
of
the
head
you
know
where
we
can
hire
traps
asked
widgery
a
cart
or
anything
asked
milton
gart
a
cart
but
no
one
said
the
larger
of
the
small
boys
partially
averting
his
face
and
staring
down
the
road
and
making
a
song
of
it
my
feyther
leg
us
a
cart
even
evidently
what
shall
we
do
it
occurred
to
milton
that
if
widgery
was
the
man
for
courtly
devotion
dangle
was
infinitely
readier
of
resource
suppose
she
said
timidly
if
you
were
to
ask
dangle
and
then
all
the
gilt
came
off
widgery
he
answered
quite
rudely
dangle
he
messed
us
up
enough
he
must
needs
drive
after
them
in
a
trap
to
tell
them
coming
and
now
you
want
me
to
ask
him
her
beautiful
blue
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
he
stopped
abruptly
go
and
ask
dangle
he
said
shortly
you
wish
and
went
striding
into
the
station
and
down
the
steps
leaving
her
in
the
road
under
the
quiet
inspection
of
the
two
little
boys
and
with
a
kind
of
ballad
refrain
running
through
her
head
are
the
knights
of
the
olden
time
and
feeling
tired
to
death
and
hungry
and
dusty
and
out
of
curl
and
in
short
a
martyr
woman
xxxi
it
goes
to
my
heart
to
tell
of
the
end
of
that
day
how
the
fugitives
vanished
into
immensity
how
there
were
no
more
trains
how
botley
stared
unsympathetically
with
a
palpable
disposition
to
derision
denying
conveyances
how
the
landlord
of
the
heron
was
suspicious
how
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
the
hot
day
had
crumpled
the
collar
of
phipps
and
stained
the
skirts
of
milton
and
dimmed
the
radiant
emotions
of
the
whole
party
dangle
with
and
a
black
eye
felt
the
absurdity
of
the
pose
of
the
wounded
knight
and
abandoned
it
after
the
faintest
efforts
recriminations
never
perhaps
held
the
foreground
of
the
talk
but
they
played
like
summer
lightning
on
the
edge
of
the
conversation
and
deep
in
the
hearts
of
all
was
a
galling
sense
of
the
ridiculous
jessie
they
thought
was
most
to
blame
apparently
too
the
worst
which
would
have
made
the
whole
business
tragic
was
not
happening
here
was
a
young
woman
young
woman
do
i
say
a
mere
girl
had
chosen
to
leave
a
comfortable
home
in
surbiton
and
all
the
delights
of
a
refined
and
intellectual
circle
and
had
rushed
off
trailing
us
after
her
posing
hard
mutually
jealous
and
now
tired
and
to
flick
us
off
at
last
mere
mud
from
her
wheel
into
this
detestable
village
on
a
saturday
night
and
she
had
done
it
not
for
love
and
passion
which
are
serious
excuses
one
may
recognise
even
if
one
must
reprobate
but
just
for
a
freak
just
for
a
fantastic
idea
for
nothing
in
fact
but
the
outraging
of
common
sense
yet
withal
such
was
our
restraint
that
we
talked
of
her
still
as
one
much
misguided
as
one
who
burthened
us
with
anxiety
as
a
lamb
astray
and
milton
having
eaten
continued
to
show
the
finest
feelings
on
the
matter
she
sat
i
may
mention
in
the
cushioned
the
only
comfortable
chair
in
the
room
and
we
sat
on
incredibly
hard
horsehair
things
having
antimacassars
tied
to
their
backs
by
means
of
bows
it
was
different
from
those
dear
old
talks
at
surbiton
somehow
she
sat
facing
the
window
which
was
open
the
night
was
so
tranquil
and
warm
and
the
dim
light
for
we
did
not
use
the
lamp
suited
her
admirably
she
talked
in
a
voice
that
told
you
she
was
tired
and
she
seemed
inclined
to
state
a
case
against
herself
in
the
matter
of
soul
it
was
such
an
evening
as
might
live
in
a
sympathetic
memoir
but
it
was
a
little
dull
while
it
lasted
feel
she
said
i
am
to
blame
i
have
developed
that
first
book
of
mine
i
do
not
go
back
upon
a
word
of
it
mind
but
it
has
been
misunderstood
has
said
widgery
trying
to
look
so
deeply
sympathetic
as
to
be
visible
in
the
dark
say
that
said
the
lady
deliberately
i
try
and
think
that
critics
are
honest
after
their
lights
i
was
not
thinking
of
critics
but
she
i
mean
she
paused
an
interrogation
is
possible
said
dangle
scrutinising
his
write
a
book
and
state
a
case
i
want
people
to
think
as
i
recommend
not
to
do
as
i
recommend
it
is
just
teaching
only
i
make
it
into
a
story
i
want
to
teach
new
ideas
new
lessons
to
promulgate
ideas
then
when
the
ideas
have
been
spread
abroad
things
will
come
about
only
now
it
is
madness
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
established
order
bernard
shaw
you
know
has
explained
that
with
regard
to
socialism
we
all
know
that
to
earn
all
you
consume
is
right
and
that
living
on
invested
capital
is
wrong
only
we
can
not
begin
while
we
are
so
few
it
is
those
said
widgery
is
those
others
they
must
begin
meanwhile
you
go
on
banking
i
some
one
else
i
live
on
lotion
while
i
try
to
gain
a
footing
in
said
phipps
have
done
and
different
said
dangle
at
the
same
time
are
so
kind
to
me
but
in
this
matter
of
course
georgina
griffiths
in
my
book
lived
alone
in
a
flat
in
paris
and
went
to
life
classes
and
had
men
visitors
but
then
she
was
over
is
only
seventeen
and
girlish
for
that
said
dangle
alters
everything
that
child
it
is
different
with
a
woman
and
georgina
griffiths
never
flaunted
her
freedom
on
a
bicycle
in
country
places
in
this
country
where
every
one
is
so
particular
fancy
sleeping
away
from
home
dreadful
if
it
gets
about
it
spells
ruin
for
said
widgery
man
would
marry
a
girl
like
that
said
phipps
must
be
hushed
up
said
dangle
always
seems
to
me
that
life
is
made
up
of
individuals
of
individual
cases
we
must
weigh
each
person
against
his
or
her
circumstances
general
rules
apply
often
feel
the
force
of
that
said
widgery
are
my
rules
of
course
my
books
different
altogether
different
said
dangle
novel
deals
with
typical
life
is
not
typical
said
widgery
with
immense
profundity
then
suddenly
unintentionally
being
himself
most
surprised
and
shocked
of
any
in
the
room
phipps
yawned
the
failing
was
infectious
and
the
gathering
having
as
you
can
easily
understand
talked
itself
weary
dispersed
on
trivial
pretences
but
not
to
sleep
immediately
directly
dangle
was
alone
he
began
with
infinite
disgust
to
scrutinise
his
darkling
eye
for
he
was
a
little
man
in
spite
of
his
energy
the
whole
business
so
near
a
capture
was
horribly
vexatious
phipps
sat
on
his
bed
for
some
time
examining
with
equal
disgust
a
collar
he
would
have
thought
incredible
for
sunday
hours
before
milton
fell
on
the
mortality
of
even
big
fat
men
with
eyes
and
widgery
was
unhappy
because
he
had
been
so
cross
to
her
at
the
station
and
because
so
far
he
did
not
feel
that
he
had
scored
over
dangle
also
he
was
angry
with
dangle
and
all
four
of
them
being
souls
living
very
much
upon
the
appearances
of
things
had
a
painful
mental
middle
distance
of
botley
derisive
and
suspicious
and
a
remoter
background
of
london
humorous
and
surbiton
speculative
were
they
really
after
all
behaving
absurdly
xxxii
hoopdriver
knight
errant
as
dangle
bad
witnessed
the
fugitives
had
been
left
by
him
by
the
side
of
the
road
about
two
miles
from
botley
before
appearance
hoopdriver
had
been
learning
with
great
interest
that
mere
roadside
flowers
had
names
wort
willow
herb
lords
and
ladies
buttons
most
curious
names
some
of
them
flowers
are
all
different
in
south
africa
he
was
explaining
with
a
happy
fluke
of
his
imagination
to
account
for
his
ignorance
then
suddenly
heralded
by
clattering
sounds
and
a
gride
of
wheels
dangle
had
flared
and
thundered
across
the
tranquillity
of
the
summer
evening
dangle
swaying
and
gesticulating
behind
a
corybantic
black
horse
had
hailed
jessie
by
her
name
had
backed
towards
the
hedge
for
no
ostensible
reason
and
vanished
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
fate
that
had
been
written
down
for
him
from
the
very
beginning
of
things
jessie
and
hoopdriver
had
scarcely
time
to
stand
up
and
seize
their
machines
before
this
tumultuous
this
swift
and
wonderful
passing
of
dangle
was
achieved
he
went
from
side
to
side
of
the
road
worse
even
than
the
riding
forth
of
hoopdriver
it
was
and
vanished
round
the
corner
knew
my
name
said
jessie
it
was
was
our
bicycles
did
that
said
hoopdriver
simultaneously
and
speaking
with
a
certain
complacent
concern
hope
he
get
was
dangle
repeated
jessie
and
hoopdriver
heard
this
time
with
a
violent
start
his
eyebrows
went
up
spasmodically
someone
you
know
was
looking
for
me
said
jessie
could
see
he
began
to
call
to
me
before
the
horse
shied
my
stepmother
has
sent
hoopdriver
wished
he
had
returned
the
bicycle
after
all
for
his
ideas
were
still
a
little
hazy
about
bechamel
and
milton
honesty
is
the
best
policy
often
he
thought
he
turned
his
head
this
way
and
that
he
became
active
us
eigh
then
come
back
gone
down
that
hill
and
he
be
able
to
pull
up
for
a
bit
jessie
he
saw
had
wheeled
her
machine
into
the
road
and
was
mounting
still
staring
at
the
corner
that
had
swallowed
up
dangle
hoopdriver
followed
suit
and
so
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
they
began
another
flight
together
riding
now
towards
bishops
waltham
with
hoopdriver
in
the
post
of
danger
the
rear
ever
and
again
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
swerving
dangerously
as
he
did
so
occasionally
jessie
had
to
slacken
her
pace
he
breathed
heavily
and
hated
himself
because
his
mouth
fell
open
after
nearly
an
hard
riding
they
found
themselves
uncaught
at
winchester
not
a
trace
of
dangle
nor
any
other
danger
was
visible
as
they
rode
into
the
dusky
street
though
the
bats
had
been
fluttering
behind
thehedges
and
the
evening
star
was
bright
while
they
were
still
two
miles
from
winchester
hoopdriver
pointed
out
the
dangers
of
stopping
in
such
an
obvious
and
gently
but
firmly
insisted
upon
replenishing
the
lamps
and
riding
on
towards
salisbury
from
winchester
roads
branch
in
every
direction
and
to
turn
abruptly
westward
was
clearly
the
way
to
throw
off
the
chase
as
hoopdriver
saw
the
moon
rising
broad
and
yellow
through
the
twilight
he
thought
he
should
revive
the
effect
of
that
ride
out
of
bognor
but
somehow
albeit
the
moon
and
all
the
atmospheric
effects
were
the
same
the
emotions
were
different
they
rode
in
absolute
silence
and
slowly
after
they
had
cleared
the
outskirts
of
winchester
both
of
them
were
now
nearly
tired
out
the
level
was
tedious
and
even
a
little
hill
a
burden
and
so
it
came
about
that
in
the
hamlet
of
wallenstock
they
were
beguiled
to
stop
and
ask
for
accommodation
in
an
exceptionally
village
inn
a
plausible
landlady
rose
to
the
occasion
now
as
they
passed
into
the
room
where
their
suppers
were
prepared
hoopdriver
caught
a
glimpse
through
a
door
ajar
and
floating
in
a
reek
of
smoke
of
three
and
a
half
faces
for
the
edge
of
the
door
cut
one
down
and
an
american
table
with
several
glasses
and
a
tankard
and
he
also
heard
a
remark
in
the
second
before
he
heard
that
remark
hoopdriver
had
been
a
proud
and
happy
man
to
particularize
a
heir
incognito
he
had
surrendered
their
bicycles
to
the
odd
man
of
the
place
with
infinite
easy
dignity
and
had
bowingly
opened
the
door
for
jessie
that
then
he
imagined
people
saying
and
then
pretty
well
orf
judge
by
the
then
the
imaginary
spectators
would
fall
of
the
fashionableness
of
bicycling
how
judges
and
stockbrokers
and
actresses
and
in
fact
all
the
best
people
rode
and
how
that
it
was
often
the
fancy
of
such
great
folk
to
shun
the
big
hotels
the
adulation
of
urban
crowds
and
seek
incognito
the
cosy
quaintnesses
of
village
life
then
maybe
they
would
think
of
a
certain
nameless
air
of
distinction
about
the
lady
who
had
stepped
across
the
doorway
and
about
the
handsome
cavalier
who
had
followed
her
in
and
they
would
look
one
to
another
you
what
it
is
one
of
the
village
elders
would
say
just
as
they
do
in
novels
voicing
the
thought
of
all
in
a
low
impressive
tone
such
a
as
entertaining
barranets
unawares
not
to
mention
no
higher
things
such
i
say
had
been
the
filmy
delightful
stuff
in
head
the
moment
before
he
heard
that
remark
but
the
remark
toppled
him
headlong
what
the
precise
remark
was
need
not
concern
us
it
was
a
casual
piece
of
such
satire
as
strephon
delights
in
should
you
be
curious
dear
lady
as
to
its
nature
you
have
merely
to
dress
yourself
in
a
really
modern
cycling
costume
get
one
of
the
of
your
men
to
escort
you
and
ride
out
next
saturday
evening
to
any
public
house
where
healthy
homely
people
gather
together
then
you
will
hear
quite
a
lot
of
the
kind
of
thing
hoopdriver
heard
more
possibly
than
you
will
desire
the
remark
i
must
add
implicated
hoopdriver
it
indicated
an
entire
disbelief
in
his
social
standing
at
a
blow
it
shattered
all
the
gorgeous
imaginative
fabric
his
mind
had
been
rejoicing
in
all
that
foolish
happiness
vanished
like
a
dream
and
there
was
nothing
to
show
for
it
as
there
is
nothing
to
show
for
any
spiteful
remark
that
has
ever
been
made
perhaps
the
man
who
said
the
thing
had
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
at
the
idea
of
taking
a
fool
down
a
peg
but
it
is
just
as
possible
he
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
his
stray
shot
had
hit
he
had
thrown
it
as
a
boy
throws
a
stone
at
a
bird
and
it
not
only
demolished
a
foolish
happy
conceit
but
it
wounded
it
touched
jessie
grossly
she
did
not
hear
it
he
concluded
from
her
subsequent
bearing
but
during
the
supper
they
had
in
the
little
private
though
she
talked
cheerfully
he
was
preoccupied
whiffs
of
indistinct
conversation
and
now
and
then
laughter
came
in
from
the
inn
parlor
through
the
pelargoniums
in
the
open
window
hoopdriver
felt
it
must
all
be
in
the
same
strain
at
her
expense
and
his
he
answered
her
abstractedly
she
was
tired
she
said
and
presently
went
to
her
room
hoopdriver
in
his
courtly
way
opened
the
door
for
her
and
bowed
her
out
he
stood
listening
and
fearing
some
new
offence
as
she
went
upstairs
and
round
the
bend
where
the
barometer
hung
beneath
the
stuffed
birds
then
he
went
back
to
the
room
and
stood
on
the
hearthrug
before
the
paper
fireplace
ornament
he
said
in
a
scathing
undertone
as
a
fresh
burst
of
laughter
came
floating
in
all
through
supper
he
had
been
composing
stinging
repartee
a
blistering
speech
of
denunciation
to
be
presently
delivered
he
would
rate
them
as
a
nobleman
should
themselves
englishmen
indeed
and
insult
a
woman
he
would
say
take
the
names
and
addresses
perhaps
threaten
to
speak
to
the
lord
of
the
manor
promise
to
let
them
hear
from
him
again
and
so
out
with
consternation
in
his
wake
it
really
ought
to
be
done
better
he
said
fiercely
and
tweaked
his
moustache
painfully
what
was
it
he
revived
the
objectionable
remark
for
his
own
exasperation
and
then
went
over
the
heads
of
his
speech
again
he
coughed
made
three
steps
towards
the
door
then
stopped
and
went
back
to
the
hearthrug
he
after
all
yet
was
he
not
a
knight
errant
should
such
men
go
unreproved
unchecked
by
wandering
baronets
incognito
magnanimity
look
at
it
in
that
way
churls
beneath
notice
no
merely
a
cowardly
subterfuge
he
would
after
all
something
within
him
protested
that
he
was
a
ass
even
as
he
went
towards
the
door
again
but
he
only
went
on
the
more
resolutely
he
crossed
the
hall
by
the
bar
and
entered
the
room
from
which
the
remark
had
proceeded
he
opened
the
door
abruptly
and
stood
scowling
on
them
in
the
doorway
only
make
a
mess
of
it
remarked
the
internal
sceptic
there
were
five
men
in
the
room
altogether
a
fat
person
with
a
long
pipe
and
a
great
number
of
chins
in
an
armchair
by
the
fireplace
who
wished
hoopdriver
a
good
evening
very
affably
a
young
fellow
smoking
a
cutty
and
displaying
crossed
legs
with
gaiters
a
little
bearded
man
with
a
toothless
laugh
a
comfortable
man
with
bright
eyes
who
wore
a
velveteen
jacket
and
a
fair
young
man
very
genteel
in
a
suit
and
a
white
tie
said
hoopdriver
looking
very
stern
and
harsh
and
then
in
a
forbidding
tone
as
one
who
consented
to
no
liberties
pleasant
day
been
said
the
fair
young
man
with
the
white
tie
said
hoopdriver
slowly
and
taking
a
brown
armchair
he
planted
it
with
great
deliberation
where
he
faced
the
fireplace
and
sat
down
see
how
did
that
speech
begin
pleasant
roads
about
here
said
the
fair
young
man
with
the
white
tie
said
hoopdriver
eyeing
him
darkly
have
to
begin
somehow
roads
about
here
are
all
right
and
the
weather
about
here
is
all
right
but
what
come
in
here
to
say
is
some
damned
unpleasant
people
damned
unpleasant
people
said
the
young
man
with
the
gaiters
apparently
making
a
mental
inventory
of
his
pearl
buttons
as
he
spoke
that
hoopdriver
put
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
stuck
out
his
elbows
with
extreme
angularity
in
his
heart
he
was
raving
at
his
idiotic
folly
at
thus
bearding
these
lions
indisputably
they
were
lions
but
he
had
to
go
through
with
it
now
heaven
send
his
breath
which
was
already
getting
a
trifle
spasmodic
did
not
suddenly
give
out
he
fixed
his
eye
on
the
face
of
the
fat
man
with
the
chins
and
spoke
in
a
low
impressive
voice
came
here
sir
said
hoopdriver
and
paused
to
inflate
his
cheeks
a
nice
lady
said
the
man
with
the
gaiters
putting
his
head
on
one
side
to
admire
a
pearl
button
that
had
been
hiding
behind
the
curvature
of
his
calf
nice
lady
came
here
said
hoopdriver
a
saw
you
did
bless
you
said
the
fat
man
with
the
chins
in
a
curious
wheezy
voice
see
anything
so
very
extraordinary
in
that
one
think
we
hoopdriver
coughed
came
here
sir
that
said
the
little
man
with
the
beard
sharply
and
went
off
into
an
amiable
chuckle
know
it
by
said
the
little
man
elaborating
the
point
hoopdriver
temporarily
lost
his
thread
he
glared
malignantly
at
the
little
man
with
the
beard
and
tried
to
recover
his
discourse
a
pause
were
saying
said
the
fair
young
man
with
the
white
tie
speaking
very
politely
you
came
here
with
a
lady
meditated
the
gaiter
gazer
the
man
in
velveteen
who
was
looking
from
one
speaker
to
another
with
keen
bright
eyes
now
laughed
as
though
a
point
had
been
scored
and
stimulated
hoopdriver
to
speak
by
fixing
him
with
an
expectant
regard
dirty
cad
said
hoopdriver
proceeding
with
his
discourse
and
suddenly
growing
extremely
fierce
a
remark
as
we
went
by
this
on
said
the
old
gentleman
with
many
chins
on
you
go
us
names
minute
said
hoopdriver
i
began
calling
did
said
the
man
with
the
chins
not
calling
any
of
you
dirty
cads
run
away
with
that
impression
only
some
person
in
this
room
made
a
remark
that
showed
he
fit
to
wipe
boots
on
and
with
all
due
deference
to
such
gentlemen
as
are
hoopdriver
looked
round
for
moral
support
want
to
know
which
it
said
the
fair
young
man
in
the
white
tie
going
to
wipe
my
boots
on
straight
away
said
hoopdriver
reverting
to
anger
if
with
a
slight
catch
in
his
throat
than
which
threat
of
personal
violence
nothing
had
been
further
from
his
thoughts
on
entering
the
room
he
said
this
because
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
and
stuck
out
his
elbows
truculently
to
hide
the
sinking
of
his
heart
it
is
curious
how
situations
run
away
with
us
charlie
said
the
little
man
and
eye
said
the
owner
of
the
chins
going
to
wipe
your
boots
on
said
the
fair
young
man
in
a
tone
of
mild
surprise
am
said
hoopdriver
with
emphatic
resolution
and
glared
in
the
young
face
fair
and
reasonable
said
the
man
in
the
velveteen
jacket
you
the
interest
of
the
meeting
seemed
transferred
to
the
young
man
in
the
white
tic
course
if
you
find
out
which
it
is
i
suppose
prepared
to
wipe
your
boots
in
a
liberal
way
on
everybody
in
the
room
said
this
young
man
in
the
same
tone
of
impersonal
question
gentleman
the
champion
lightweight
up
charlie
said
the
young
man
with
the
gaiters
looking
up
for
a
moment
go
in
your
betters
fair
and
square
you
get
out
of
it
this
gent
began
hoopdriver
course
said
the
young
man
in
the
white
tie
it
comes
to
talking
of
wiping
boots
not
talking
going
to
do
it
said
hoopdriver
he
looked
round
at
the
meeting
they
were
no
longer
antagonists
they
were
spectators
he
would
have
to
go
through
with
it
now
but
this
tone
of
personal
aggression
on
the
maker
of
the
remark
had
somehow
got
rid
of
the
oppressive
feeling
of
hoopdriver
contra
mundum
apparently
he
would
have
to
fight
someone
would
he
get
a
black
eye
would
he
get
very
much
hurt
pray
goodness
it
that
sturdy
chap
in
the
gaiters
should
he
rise
and
begin
what
would
she
think
if
he
brought
a
black
eye
to
breakfast
this
the
man
said
hoopdriver
with
a
calm
and
arms
more
angular
than
ever
said
the
little
man
with
the
beard
straight
on
said
the
young
man
in
the
white
tie
on
a
minute
if
i
did
happen
to
say
did
did
you
said
hoopdriver
out
of
it
charlie
said
the
young
man
with
the
gaiters
a
bit
said
charlie
we
can
pass
a
bit
of
a
joke
going
to
teach
you
to
keep
your
jokes
to
yourself
said
hoopdriver
said
the
shepherd
of
the
flock
of
chins
is
a
bit
too
free
with
his
jokes
said
the
little
man
with
the
beard
downright
disgusting
said
hoopdriver
falling
back
upon
his
speech
lady
ride
a
bicycle
in
a
country
road
or
wear
a
dress
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
but
every
dirty
little
greaser
must
needs
go
shouting
insults
know
the
young
lady
would
hear
what
i
said
said
charlie
one
can
speak
friendly
to
friends
how
was
i
to
know
the
door
was
open
hoopdriver
began
to
suspect
that
his
antagonist
was
if
possible
more
seriously
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
violence
than
himself
and
his
spirits
rose
again
these
chaps
ought
to
have
a
thorough
lesson
course
you
knew
the
door
was
open
he
retorted
indignantly
course
you
thought
we
should
hear
what
you
said
go
telling
lies
about
it
no
good
your
saying
things
like
that
had
your
fun
and
you
meant
to
have
your
fun
and
i
mean
to
make
an
example
of
you
beer
said
the
little
man
with
the
beard
in
a
confidential
tone
to
the
velveteen
jacket
regular
up
this
weather
its
bottles
it
is
the
good
of
scrapping
about
in
a
said
charlie
appealing
to
the
company
fair
fight
without
interruptions
now
i
mind
if
the
so
evidently
the
man
was
horribly
afraid
hoopdriver
grew
truculent

like
said
hoopdriver
wherever
you
insulted
the
gent
said
the
man
in
velveteen
be
a
funk
charlie
said
the
man
in
gaiters
you
got
a
stone
of
him
if
you
got
an
i
say
is
this
said
the
gentleman
with
the
excessive
chins
trying
to
get
a
hearing
by
banging
his
chair
arms
charlie
goes
saying
things
he
ought
to
back
up
what
i
say
i
mind
his
such
things
all
but
he
ought
to
be
prepared
to
back
back
up
all
right
said
charlie
with
extremely
bitter
emphasis
on
the
gentleman
likes
to
come
toosday
week
chopped
in
hoopdriver
said
the
owner
of
the
chins
put
off
till
charlie
what
you
can
do
said
the
man
in
the
velveteen
coat
got
to
do
it
charlie
said
the
man
in
gaiters
no
like
this
said
charlie
appealing
to
everyone
except
hoopdriver
me
got
to
take
in
her
dinner
night
how
should
i
look
with
a
black
eye
and
going
round
with
the
carriage
with
a
split
lip
you
want
your
face
charlie
why
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
said
the
person
in
gaiters
said
hoopdriver
driving
it
home
with
great
fierceness
you
shut
your
ugly
mouth
as
much
as
my
worth
protested
charlie
should
have
thought
of
that
before
said
hoopdriver
no
occasion
to
be
so
about
it
i
only
meant
the
thing
joking
said
charlie
one
gentleman
to
another
very
sorry
if
the
annoyed
everybody
began
to
speak
at
once
hoopdriver
twirled
his
moustache
he
felt
that
recognition
of
his
gentlemanliness
was
at
any
rate
a
redeeming
feature
but
it
became
his
pose
to
ride
hard
and
heavy
over
the
routed
foe
he
shouted
some
insulting
phrase
over
the
tumult
regular
abject
the
man
in
gaiters
was
saying
to
charlie
more
confusion
think
afraid
not
of
a
cuss
like
him
shouted
charlie
i
of
front
thought
hoopdriver
a
little
startled
are
we
going
sit
there
and
be
abusive
said
the
man
in
velveteen
offered
to
hit
you
and
if
i
was
him
hit
you
right
then
said
charlie
with
a
sudden
change
of
front
and
springing
to
his
feet
i
must
i
must
now
then
at
that
hoopdriver
the
child
of
fate
rose
too
with
a
horrible
sense
that
his
internal
monitor
was
right
things
had
taken
a
turn
he
had
made
a
mess
of
it
and
now
there
was
nothing
for
it
so
far
as
he
could
see
but
to
hit
the
man
at
once
he
and
charlie
stood
six
feet
apart
with
a
table
between
both
very
breathless
and
fierce
a
vulgar
fight
in
a
and
with
what
was
only
too
palpably
a
footman
good
heavens
and
this
was
the
dignified
scornful
remonstrance
how
the
juice
had
it
all
happened
go
round
the
table
at
him
i
suppose
but
before
the
brawl
could
achieve
itself
the
man
in
gaiters
intervened
here
he
said
stepping
between
the
antagonists
everyone
was
standing
up
artful
said
the
little
man
with
the
beard
yard
said
the
man
with
the
gaiters
taking
the
control
of
the
entire
affair
with
the
easy
readiness
of
an
accomplished
practitioner
the
gentleman
yard
it
seemed
was
the
very
place
do
the
thing
regular
and
decent
if
you
and
before
he
completely
realized
what
was
happening
hoopdriver
was
being
marched
out
through
the
back
premises
of
the
inn
to
the
first
and
only
fight
with
fists
that
was
ever
to
glorify
his
life
outwardly
so
far
as
the
intermittent
moonlight
showed
hoopdriver
was
quietly
but
eagerly
prepared
to
fight
but
inwardly
he
was
a
chaos
of
conflicting
purposes
it
was
extraordinary
how
things
happened
one
remark
had
trod
so
closely
on
the
heels
of
another
that
he
had
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
following
the
development
of
the
business
he
distinctly
remembered
himself
walking
across
from
one
room
to
the
other
a
dignified
even
an
aristocratic
figure
primed
with
considered
eloquence
intent
upon
a
scathing
remonstrance
to
these
wretched
yokels
regarding
their
manners
then
incident
had
flickered
into
incident
until
here
he
was
out
in
a
moonlit
lane
a
slight
dark
figure
in
a
group
of
larger
indistinct
figures
marching
in
a
quiet
way
towards
some
unknown
horror
at
yard
fists
it
was
astonishing
it
was
terrible
in
front
of
him
was
the
pallid
figure
of
charles
and
he
saw
that
the
man
in
gaiters
held
charles
kindly
but
firmly
by
the
arm
blasted
rot
charles
was
saying
up
a
fight
just
for
a
thing
like
that
all
very
well
for
got
no
blessed
dinner
to
take
up
night
like
i
no
need
to
numb
my
arm
is
there
they
went
into
yard
through
gates
there
were
sheds
in
yard
sheds
of
mystery
that
the
moonlight
could
not
solve
a
smell
of
cows
and
a
pump
stood
out
clear
and
black
throwing
a
clear
black
shadow
on
the
whitewashed
wall
and
here
it
was
his
face
was
to
be
battered
to
a
pulp
he
knew
this
was
the
uttermost
folly
to
stand
up
here
and
be
pounded
but
the
way
out
of
it
was
beyond
his
imagining
yet
afterwards
could
he
ever
face
her
again
he
patted
his
norfolk
jacket
and
took
his
ground
with
his
back
to
the
gate
how
did
one
square
so
suppose
one
were
to
turn
and
run
even
now
run
straight
back
to
the
inn
and
lock
himself
into
his
bedroom
they
make
him
come
out
anyhow
he
could
prosecute
them
for
assault
if
they
did
how
did
one
set
about
prosecuting
for
assault
he
saw
charles
with
his
face
ghastly
white
under
the
moon
squaring
in
front
of
him
he
caught
a
blow
on
the
arm
and
gave
ground
charles
pressed
him
then
he
hit
with
his
right
and
with
the
violence
of
despair
it
was
a
hit
of
his
own
devising
an
impromptu
but
it
chanced
to
coincide
with
the
regulation
hook
hit
at
the
head
he
perceived
with
a
leap
of
exultation
that
the
thing
his
fist
had
met
was
the
jawbone
of
charles
it
was
the
sole
gleam
of
pleasure
he
experienced
during
the
fight
and
it
was
quite
momentary
he
had
hardly
got
home
upon
charles
before
he
was
struck
in
the
chest
and
whirled
backward
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
his
feet
he
felt
that
his
heart
was
smashed
flat
darm
said
somebody
dancing
toe
in
hand
somewhere
behind
him
as
hoopdriver
staggered
charles
gave
a
loud
and
cry
he
seemed
to
tower
over
hoopdriver
in
the
moonlight
both
his
fists
were
whirling
it
was
annihilation
coming
no
less
hoopdriver
ducked
perhaps
and
certainly
gave
ground
to
the
right
hit
and
missed
charles
swept
round
to
the
left
missing
generously
a
blow
glanced
over
left
ear
and
the
flanking
movement
was
completed
another
blow
behind
the
ear
heaven
and
earth
spun
furiously
round
hoopdriver
and
then
he
became
aware
of
a
figure
in
a
light
suit
shooting
violently
through
an
open
gate
into
the
night
the
man
in
gaiters
sprang
forward
past
hoopdriver
but
too
late
to
intercept
the
fugitive
there
were
shouts
laughter
and
hoopdriver
still
solemnly
squaring
realized
the
great
and
wonderful
truth
charles
had
fled
he
hoopdriver
had
fought
and
by
all
the
rules
of
war
had
won
was
a
pretty
cut
under
the
jaw
you
gave
him
the
toothless
little
man
with
the
beard
was
remarking
in
an
unexpectedly
friendly
manner
fact
of
it
is
said
hoopdriver
sitting
beside
the
road
to
salisbury
and
with
the
sound
of
distant
church
bells
in
his
cars
had
to
give
the
fellow
a
lesson
simply
had
seems
so
dreadful
that
you
should
have
to
knock
people
about
said
jessie
louts
get
unbearable
said
hoopdriver
now
and
then
we
give
them
a
lesson
well
a
lady
cyclist
in
the
roads
would
be
an
suppose
every
woman
shrinks
from
violence
said
jessie
suppose
men
are
braver
in
a
way
than
women
it
seems
to
imagine
how
one
could
bring
oneself
to
face
a
roomful
of
rough
characters
pick
out
the
bravest
and
give
him
an
exemplary
thrashing
i
quail
at
the
idea
i
thought
only
guardsmen
did
things
like
was
nothing
more
than
my
juty
as
a
gentleman
said
hoopdriver
to
walk
straight
into
the
face
of
danger
habit
said
hoopdriver
quite
modestly
flicking
off
a
particle
of
cigarette
ash
that
had
settled
on
his
knee
xxxiii
the
abasement
of
hoopdriver
on
monday
morning
the
two
fugitives
found
themselves
breakfasting
at
the
golden
pheasant
in
blandford
they
were
in
the
course
of
an
elaborate
doubling
movement
through
dorsetshire
towards
ringwood
where
jessie
anticipated
an
answer
from
her
schoolmistress
friend
by
this
time
they
had
been
nearly
sixty
hours
together
and
you
will
understand
that
feelings
had
undergone
a
considerable
intensification
and
development
at
first
jessie
had
been
only
an
impressionist
sketch
upon
his
mind
something
feminine
active
and
dazzling
something
emphatically
him
cast
into
his
company
by
a
kindly
fate
his
chief
idea
at
the
outset
as
you
know
had
been
to
live
up
to
her
level
by
pretending
to
be
more
exceptional
more
wealthy
better
educated
and
above
all
better
born
than
he
was
his
knowledge
of
the
feminine
mind
was
almost
entirely
derived
from
the
young
ladies
he
had
met
in
business
and
in
that
class
as
in
military
society
and
among
servants
the
good
old
tradition
of
a
brutal
social
exclusiveness
is
still
religiously
preserved
he
had
an
almost
intolerable
dread
of
her
thinking
him
a
i
later
he
began
to
perceive
the
distinction
of
her
idiosyncracies
coupled
with
a
magnificent
want
of
experience
was
a
splendid
enthusiasm
for
abstract
views
of
the
most
advanced
description
and
her
strength
of
conviction
completely
carried
hoopdriver
away
she
was
going
to
live
her
own
life
with
emphasis
and
hoopdriver
was
profoundly
stirred
to
similar
resolves
so
soon
as
he
grasped
the
tenor
of
her
views
he
perceived
that
he
himself
had
thought
as
much
from
his
earliest
years
course
he
remarked
in
a
flash
of
sexual
pride
man
is
freer
than
a
woman
end
in
the
colonies
there
half
the
conventionality
you
find
in
society
in
this
he
made
one
or
two
essays
in
the
display
of
unconventionality
and
was
quite
unaware
that
he
impressed
her
as
a
person
he
suppressed
the
habits
of
years
and
made
no
proposal
to
go
to
church
he
discussed
in
a
liberal
spirit
jest
a
habit
he
said
a
custom
i
see
what
good
it
does
you
at
all
and
he
made
a
lot
of
excellent
jokes
at
the
hat
jokes
he
had
read
in
the
globe
on
that
subject
but
he
showed
his
gentle
breeding
by
keeping
his
gloves
on
all
through
the
ride
and
ostentatiously
throwing
away
more
than
half
a
cigarette
when
they
passed
a
church
whose
congregation
was
gathering
for
afternoon
service
he
cautiously
avoided
literary
topics
except
by
way
of
compliment
seeing
that
she
was
presently
to
be
writing
books
it
was
on
initiative
that
they
attended
service
in
the
gallery
of
blandford
church
conscience
i
may
perhaps
tell
you
was
now
suffering
the
severest
twinges
she
perceived
clearly
that
things
were
not
working
out
quite
along
the
lines
she
had
she
had
read
her
olive
schreiner
and
george
egerton
and
so
forth
with
all
the
want
of
perfect
comprehension
of
one
who
is
still
emotionally
a
girl
she
knew
the
thing
to
do
was
to
have
a
flat
and
to
go
to
the
british
museum
and
write
leading
articles
for
the
daily
papers
until
something
better
came
along
if
bechamel
detestable
person
had
kept
his
promises
instead
of
behaving
with
unspeakable
horridness
all
would
have
been
well
now
her
only
hope
was
that
woman
miss
mergle
who
a
year
ago
had
sent
her
out
highly
educated
into
the
world
miss
mergle
had
told
her
at
parting
to
live
fearlessly
and
truly
and
had
further
given
her
a
volume
of
essays
and
republic
to
help
her
through
the
rapids
of
adolescence
feelings
for
her
household
at
surbiton
amounted
to
an
active
detestation
there
are
no
graver
or
more
solemn
women
in
the
world
than
these
clever
girls
whose
scholastic
advancement
has
retarded
their
feminine
coquetry
in
spite
of
the
advanced
tone
of
antimarital
novel
jessie
had
speedily
seen
through
that
amiable
amiable
defences
the
variety
of
pose
necessitated
by
the
corps
of
annoyed
her
to
an
altogether
unreasonable
degree
to
return
to
this
life
of
ridiculous
unreality
unconditional
capitulation
to
was
an
exasperating
prospect
yet
what
else
was
there
to
do
you
will
understand
therefore
that
at
times
she
was
moody
and
hoopdriver
respectfully
silent
and
attentive
and
at
times
inclined
to
eloquent
denunciation
of
the
existing
order
of
things
she
was
a
socialist
hoopdriver
learnt
and
he
gave
a
vague
intimation
that
he
went
further
intending
thereby
no
less
than
the
horrors
of
anarchism
he
would
have
owned
up
to
the
destruction
of
the
winter
palace
indeed
had
he
had
the
faintest
idea
where
the
winter
palace
was
and
had
his
assurance
amounted
to
certainty
that
the
winter
palace
was
destroyed
he
agreed
with
her
cordially
that
the
position
of
women
was
intolerable
but
checked
himself
on
verge
of
the
proposition
that
a
girl
ought
not
to
expect
a
fellow
to
hand
down
boxes
for
her
when
he
was
getting
the
from
a
customer
it
was
preoccupation
with
her
own
perplexities
no
doubt
that
delayed
the
unveiling
of
hoopdriver
all
through
saturday
and
sunday
once
or
twice
however
there
were
incidents
that
put
him
about
terribly
even
questions
that
savoured
of
suspicion
on
sunday
night
for
no
conceivable
reason
an
unwonted
wakefulness
came
upon
him
unaccountably
he
realised
he
was
a
contemptible
liar
all
through
the
small
hours
of
monday
he
reviewed
the
tale
of
his
falsehoods
and
when
he
tried
to
turn
his
mind
from
that
the
financial
problem
suddenly
rose
upon
him
he
heard
two
strike
and
three
it
is
odd
how
unhappy
some
of
us
are
at
times
when
we
are
at
our
happiest
xxxiv
morning
madam
said
hoopdriver
as
jessie
came
into
the
breakfast
room
of
the
golden
pheasant
on
monday
morning
and
he
smiled
bowed
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
pulled
out
a
chair
for
her
and
rubbed
his
hands
again
she
stopped
abruptly
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
her
face
have
i
seen
that
before
she
said
chair
said
hoopdriver
flushing
the
she
came
forward
and
shook
hands
with
him
looking
the
while
curiously
into
his
face
madam
a
habit
said
hoopdriver
guiltily
bad
habit
calling
ladies
madam
you
must
put
it
down
to
our
colonial
roughness
out
there
up
country
the
ladies
so
rare
we
call
all
have
some
funny
habits
brother
chris
said
jessie
you
sell
your
diamond
shares
and
go
into
society
as
you
say
and
stand
for
parliament
what
a
fine
thing
it
is
to
be
a
man
you
must
cure
yourself
that
habit
of
bowing
as
you
do
and
rubbing
your
hands
and
looking
a
know
but
i
think
it
a
good
one
you
mind
my
telling
you
a
bit
blessed
or
afflicted
with
a
trick
of
observation
said
jessie
looking
at
the
breakfast
table
hoopdriver
put
his
hand
to
his
moustache
and
then
thinking
this
might
be
another
habit
checked
his
arm
and
stuck
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
felt
juiced
awkward
to
use
his
private
formula
eye
wandered
to
the
armchair
where
a
piece
of
binding
was
loose
and
possibly
to
carry
out
her
theory
of
an
observant
disposition
she
turned
and
asked
him
for
a
pin
hand
fluttered
instinctively
to
his
lappel
and
there
planted
by
habit
were
a
couple
of
stray
pins
he
had
impounded
an
odd
place
to
put
pins
exclaimed
jessie
taking
it
said
hoopdriver
saw
a
chap
in
a
shop
do
it
must
have
a
careful
disposition
she
said
over
her
shoulder
kneeling
down
to
the
chair
the
centre
of
africa
up
country
that
is
one
learns
to
value
pins
said
hoopdriver
after
a
perceptible
pause
over
many
pins
in
africa
they
lie
about
on
the
ground
his
face
was
now
in
a
fine
red
glow
where
would
the
draper
break
out
next
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
coat
pockets
then
took
one
out
again
furtively
removed
the
second
pin
and
dropped
it
behind
him
gently
it
fell
with
a
loud
on
the
fender
happily
she
made
no
remark
being
preoccupied
with
the
binding
of
the
chair
hoopdriver
instead
of
sitting
down
went
up
to
the
table
and
stood
against
it
with
his
upon
the
cloth
they
were
keeping
breakfast
a
tremendous
time
he
took
up
his
rolled
serviette
looked
closely
and
scrutinisingly
at
the
ring
then
put
his
hand
under
the
fold
of
the
napkin
and
examined
the
texture
and
put
the
thing
down
again
then
he
had
a
vague
impulse
to
finger
his
hollow
wisdom
tooth
happily
checked
he
suddenly
discovered
he
was
standing
as
if
the
table
was
a
counter
and
sat
down
forthwith
he
drummed
with
his
hand
on
the
table
he
felt
dreadfully
hot
and
is
late
said
jessie
standing
up
it
conversation
was
slack
jessie
wanted
to
know
the
distance
to
ringwood
then
silence
fell
again
hoopdriver
very
uncomfortable
and
studying
an
easy
bearing
looked
again
at
the
breakfast
things
and
then
idly
lifted
the
corner
of
the
tablecloth
on
the
ends
of
his
fingers
and
regarded
it
three
he
thought
privately
do
you
do
that
said
jessie
said
hoopdriver
dropping
the
tablecloth
convulsively
at
the
cloth
like
that
i
saw
you
do
it
yesterday
face
became
quite
a
bright
red
he
began
pulling
his
moustache
nervously
know
he
said
know
a
queer
habit
i
know
but
out
there
you
know
native
servants
you
know
and
a
queer
thing
to
talk
about
but
one
has
to
look
at
things
to
see
whether
quite
clean
or
not
got
to
be
a
odd
said
jessie
it
mumbled
hoopdriver
i
were
a
sherlock
holmes
said
jessie
suppose
i
could
have
told
you
were
a
colonial
from
little
things
like
that
but
anyhow
i
guessed
it
i
said
hoopdriver
in
a
melancholy
tone
guessed
why
not
seize
the
opportunity
for
a
neat
confession
and
add
in
this
case
you
guessed
did
she
suspect
then
at
the
psychological
moment
the
girl
bumped
the
door
open
with
her
tray
and
brought
in
the
coffee
and
scrambled
eggs
am
rather
lucky
with
my
intuitions
sometimes
said
jessie
remorse
that
had
been
accumulating
in
his
mind
for
two
days
surged
to
the
top
of
his
mind
what
a
shabby
liar
he
was
and
besides
he
must
sooner
or
later
inevitably
give
himself
away
xxxv
hoopdriver
helped
the
eggs
and
then
instead
of
beginning
sat
with
his
cheek
on
his
hand
watching
jessie
pour
out
the
coffee
his
ears
were
a
bright
red
and
his
eyes
bright
he
took
his
coffee
cup
clumsily
cleared
his
throat
suddenly
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
do
it
he
said
aloud
what
said
jessie
looking
up
in
surprise
over
the
coffee
pot
she
was
just
beginning
her
scrambled
egg
what
milton
a
he
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
regarded
her
with
a
frown
of
tremendous
resolution
then
in
measured
accents
and
moving
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
he
announced
a
a
draper
i
thought
thought
wrong
but
bound
to
come
up
pins
attitude
habits
plain
enough
a
assistant
let
out
for
a
holiday
jest
a
assistant
not
much
is
it
a
assistant
a
position
to
be
ashamed
of
she
said
recovering
and
not
quite
understanding
yet
what
this
all
meant
it
is
he
said
a
man
in
this
country
now
to
be
just
another
hand
as
i
am
to
have
to
wear
what
clothes
you
are
told
and
go
to
church
to
please
customers
and
work
no
other
kind
of
men
stand
such
hours
a
drunken
a
king
to
why
are
you
telling
me
this
now
important
you
should
know
at
benson
all
if
you
mind
my
speaking
about
myself
a
bit
a
few
things
like
to
tell
you
i
go
on
deceiving
you
my
not
benson
why
i
told
you
benson
i
know
except
that
a
kind
of
fool
well
i
wanted
somehow
to
seem
more
than
i
was
my
that
about
south
africa
and
that
the
discovery
of
diamonds
on
the
ostrich
farm
lies
too
and
all
the
reminiscences
of
the
giraffes
lies
too
i
never
rode
on
no
giraffes
be
he
looked
at
her
with
a
kind
of
sullen
satisfaction
he
had
eased
his
conscience
anyhow
she
regarded
him
in
infinite
perplexity
this
was
a
new
side
altogether
to
the
man
why
she
began
did
i
tell
you
such
things
know
silly
sort
of
chap
i
expect
i
suppose
i
wanted
to
impress
you
but
somehow
now
i
want
you
to
know
the
silence
breakfast
untouched
thought
tell
you
said
hoopdriver
suppose
snobbishness
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
as
much
as
anything
i
lay
awake
pretty
near
all
last
night
thinking
about
myself
thinking
what
a
imitation
of
a
man
i
was
and
all
you
any
diamond
shares
and
you
are
not
going
into
parliament
and
not
lies
said
hoopdriver
in
a
sepulchral
voice
from
beginning
to
end
i
came
to
tell
i
she
stared
at
him
blankly
never
set
eyes
on
africa
in
my
life
said
hoopdriver
completing
the
confession
then
he
pulled
his
right
hand
from
his
pocket
and
with
the
nonchalance
of
one
to
whom
the
bitterness
of
death
is
passed
began
to
drink
his
coffee
a
little
surprising
began
jessie
vaguely
it
over
said
hoopdriver
sorry
from
the
bottom
of
my
and
then
breakfast
proceeded
in
silence
jessie
ate
very
little
and
seemed
lost
in
thought
hoopdriver
was
so
overcome
by
contrition
and
anxiety
that
he
consumed
an
extraordinarily
large
breakfast
out
of
pure
nervousness
and
ate
his
scrambled
eggs
for
the
most
part
with
the
spoon
that
belonged
properly
to
the
marmalade
his
eyes
were
gloomily
downcast
she
glanced
at
him
through
her
eyelashes
once
or
twice
she
struggled
with
laughter
once
or
twice
she
seemed
to
be
indignant
know
what
to
think
she
said
at
last
know
what
to
make
of
you
brother
chris
i
thought
do
you
know
that
you
were
perfectly
honest
and
somehow
think
so
with
all
those
lies
said
hoopdriver
fair
ashamed
of
myself
but
anyhow
stopped
deceiving
thought
said
the
young
lady
in
grey
story
of
the
lion
said
hoopdriver
remind
me
of
thought
somehow
i
felt
that
the
things
you
said
ring
quite
she
suddenly
broke
out
in
laughter
at
the
expression
of
his
face
course
you
are
honest
she
said
could
i
ever
doubt
it
as
if
had
never
pretended
i
see
it
all
abruptly
she
rose
and
extended
her
hand
across
the
breakfast
things
he
looked
at
her
doubtfully
and
saw
the
dancing
friendliness
in
her
eyes
he
scarcely
understood
at
first
he
rose
holding
the
marmalade
spoon
and
took
her
proffered
hand
with
abject
humility
he
broke
out
you
enough
but
there
see
it
all
a
brilliant
inspiration
had
suddenly
obscured
her
humour
she
sat
down
suddenly
and
he
sat
down
too
did
it
she
said
you
wanted
to
help
me
and
you
thought
i
was
too
conventional
to
take
help
from
one
i
might
think
my
social
was
partly
it
said
hoopdriver
you
misunderstood
me
she
said
mind
was
noble
of
you
but
i
am
sorry
she
said
should
think
me
likely
to
be
ashamed
of
you
because
you
follow
a
decent
know
at
first
you
see
said
hoopdriver
and
he
submitted
meekly
to
a
restoration
of
his
he
was
as
useful
a
citizen
as
could
be
it
was
proposed
and
carried
and
his
lying
was
of
the
noblest
and
so
the
breakfast
concluded
much
more
happily
than
his
brightest
expectation
and
they
rode
out
of
ruddy
little
blandford
as
though
no
shadow
of
any
sort
had
come
between
them
xxxvi
as
they
were
sitting
by
the
roadside
among
the
pine
trees
up
a
stretch
of
hill
between
wimborne
and
ringwood
however
hoopdriver
reopened
the
question
of
his
worldly
position
think
he
began
abruptly
removing
a
meditative
cigarette
from
his
mouth
a
shopman
is
a
decent
citizen
not
he
puts
people
off
with
what
they
quite
want
for
instance
he
do
that
said
hoopdriver
get
a
crib
if
he
no
good
your
arguing
not
a
particularly
honest
nor
a
particularly
useful
trade
not
very
high
up
no
freedom
and
no
leisure
seven
to
every
day
in
the
week
leave
much
edge
to
live
on
does
it
real
workmen
laugh
at
us
and
educated
chaps
like
bank
clerks
and
clerks
look
down
on
us
you
look
respectable
outside
and
inside
you
are
packed
in
dormitories
like
convicts
fed
on
bread
and
butter
and
bullied
like
slaves
just
superior
enough
to
feel
that
not
superior
without
capital
no
prospects
one
draper
in
a
hundred
even
earn
enough
to
marry
on
and
if
he
does
marry
his
can
just
use
him
to
black
boots
if
he
likes
and
he
put
his
back
up
drapery
and
you
tell
me
to
be
contented
would
you
be
contented
if
you
was
a
shop
girl
she
did
not
answer
she
looked
at
him
with
distress
in
her
brown
eyes
and
he
remained
gloomily
in
possession
of
the
field
presently
he
spoke
been
thinking
he
said
and
stopped
she
turned
her
face
resting
her
cheek
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
there
was
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
made
the
expression
of
them
tender
hoopdriver
had
not
looked
in
her
face
while
he
had
talked
he
had
regarded
the
grass
and
pointed
his
remarks
with
redknuckled
hands
held
open
and
palms
upwards
now
they
hung
limply
over
his
knees
she
said
was
thinking
it
this
morning
said
hoopdriver
course
like
this
about
i
had
my
schooling
all
right
to
fifteen
say
well
that
leaves
me
eight
years
is
it
too
late
i
so
backward
i
did
algebra
and
latin
up
to
auxiliary
verbs
and
french
genders
i
got
a
kind
of
now
you
mean
should
you
go
on
working
said
hoopdriver
it
you
do
much
at
drapery
without
capital
you
know
but
if
i
could
get
really
educated
thought
sometimes
not
said
the
young
lady
in
grey
hoopdriver
was
surprised
to
see
it
in
that
light
think
he
said
course
you
are
a
man
you
are
free
she
warmed
wish
i
were
you
to
have
the
chance
of
that
i
man
enough
said
hoopdriver
aloud
but
addressing
himself
that
eight
years
he
said
to
her
can
make
it
up
what
you
call
educated
men
not
going
on
you
can
catch
them
they
are
quite
satisfied
playing
golf
and
thinking
of
clever
things
to
say
to
women
like
my
stepmother
and
dining
out
in
front
of
them
already
in
one
thing
they
think
they
know
everything
you
and
they
know
such
little
said
hoopdriver
you
encourage
a
fellow
i
could
only
help
you
she
said
and
left
an
eloquent
hiatus
he
became
pensive
again
pretty
evident
you
think
much
of
a
draper
he
said
abruptly
another
interval
of
men
she
said
come
from
the
very
lowest
ranks
of
life
there
was
burns
a
ploughman
and
hugh
miller
a
stonemason
and
plenty
of
others
dodsley
was
a
footman
drapers
too
sort
of
shabby
genteel
to
rise
our
coats
and
cuffs
might
get
crumpled
there
a
clarke
who
wrote
theology
he
was
a
was
one
started
a
sewing
cotton
the
only
one
i
ever
heard
tell
you
ever
read
said
hoopdriver
he
did
not
wait
for
her
context
but
suddenly
broke
out
with
an
account
of
his
literary
requirements
fact
is
read
precious
little
one
get
much
of
a
chance
situated
as
i
am
we
have
a
library
at
business
and
gone
through
that
most
besant
read
and
a
lot
of
and
rider
haggard
and
marie
corelli
and
well
a
ouida
or
so
good
stories
of
course
and
writers
but
they
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
me
but
heaps
of
books
one
hears
talked
about
i
you
read
any
other
books
but
novels
ever
one
gets
tired
after
business
and
you
get
the
books
i
have
been
to
some
extension
lectures
of
course
dramatists
it
was
but
it
seemed
a
little
you
know
and
i
went
and
did
at
the
same
place
but
it
seem
leading
nowhere
and
i
cut
my
thumb
and
chucked
he
made
a
depressing
spectacle
with
his
face
anxious
and
his
hands
limp
makes
me
sick
he
said
think
how
been
fooled
with
my
old
schoolmaster
ought
to
have
a
juiced
hiding
a
thief
he
pretended
to
undertake
to
make
a
man
of
me
and
stole
years
of
my
life
filled
me
up
with
scraps
and
sweepings
here
i
am
i
know
anything
and
i
do
anything
and
all
the
learning
time
is
it
she
said
but
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
people
know
any
better
and
went
and
paid
thirty
pounds
premium
thirty
pounds
down
to
have
me
made
this
the
promised
to
teach
me
the
trade
and
he
never
taught
me
anything
but
to
be
a
hand
the
way
they
do
with
apprentices
if
every
swindler
was
locked
up
well
have
nowhere
to
buy
tape
and
cotton
all
very
well
to
bring
up
burns
and
those
chaps
but
not
that
make
yet
not
such
muck
that
i
might
not
have
been
better
with
teaching
i
wonder
what
the
chaps
who
sneer
and
laugh
at
such
as
me
would
be
if
been
fooled
about
as
been
at
a
long
he
looked
up
with
a
wintry
smile
a
sadder
and
wiser
hoopdriver
indeed
than
him
of
the
glorious
imaginings
you
done
this
he
said
real
and
it
sets
me
thinking
what
i
really
am
and
what
i
might
have
been
suppose
it
was
all
different
it
stop
playing
at
life
face
it
like
a
said
hoopdriver
glancing
at
her
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
even
then
not
much
good
beginning
too
and
there
in
blankly
thoughtful
silence
that
conversation
ended
xxxvii
in
the
new
forest
at
ringwood
they
lunched
and
jessie
met
with
a
disappointment
there
was
no
letter
for
her
at
the
post
office
opposite
the
hotel
the
chequered
career
was
a
machine
shop
with
a
conspicuously
marlborough
club
tandem
tricycle
displayed
in
the
window
together
with
the
announcement
that
bicycles
and
tricycles
were
on
hire
within
the
establishment
was
impressed
on
mind
by
the
action
in
coming
across
the
road
and
narrowly
inspecting
their
machines
his
action
revived
a
number
of
disagreeable
impressions
but
happily
came
to
nothing
while
they
were
still
lunching
a
tall
clergyman
with
a
heated
face
entered
the
room
and
sat
down
at
the
table
next
to
theirs
he
was
in
a
kind
of
holiday
costume
that
is
to
say
he
had
a
more
than
usually
high
collar
fastened
behind
and
rather
the
worse
for
the
weather
and
his
coat
had
been
replaced
by
a
black
jacket
of
quite
remarkable
brevity
he
had
faded
brown
shoes
on
his
feet
his
trouser
legs
were
grey
with
dust
and
he
wore
a
hat
of
piebald
straw
in
the
place
of
the
customary
soft
felt
he
was
evidently
socially
inclined
most
charming
day
sir
he
said
in
a
ringing
tenor
said
hoopdriver
over
a
portion
of
pie
are
i
perceive
cycling
through
this
delightful
country
said
the
clergyman
explained
hoopdriver
can
imagine
that
with
a
properly
oiled
machine
there
can
be
no
easier
nor
pleasanter
way
of
seeing
the
said
hoopdriver
half
a
bad
way
of
getting
a
young
and
newly
married
couple
a
tandem
bicycle
must
be
i
should
imagine
a
delightful
so
said
hoopdriver
reddening
a
little
you
ride
a
tandem
separate
said
hoopdriver
motion
through
the
air
is
indisputably
of
a
very
exhilarating
with
that
decision
the
clergyman
turned
to
give
his
orders
to
the
attendant
in
a
firm
authoritative
voice
for
a
cup
of
tea
two
gelatine
lozenges
bread
and
butter
salad
and
pie
to
follow
gelatine
lozenges
i
must
have
i
require
them
to
precipitate
the
tannin
in
my
tea
he
remarked
to
the
room
at
large
and
folding
his
hands
remained
for
some
time
with
his
chin
thereon
staring
fixedly
at
a
little
picture
over
head
myself
am
a
cyclist
said
the
clergyman
descending
suddenly
upon
hoopdriver
said
hoopdriver
attacking
the
moustache
machine
may
i
ask
have
recently
become
possessed
of
a
tricycle
a
bicycle
is
i
regret
to
say
considered
too
how
shall
i
put
it
flippant
by
my
parishioners
so
i
have
a
tricycle
i
have
just
been
hauling
it
said
jessie
surprised
a
shoe
lace
and
partly
carrying
it
on
my
the
pause
was
unexpected
jessie
had
some
trouble
with
a
crumb
face
passed
through
several
phases
of
surprise
then
he
saw
the
explanation
an
accident
can
hardly
call
it
an
accident
the
wheels
suddenly
refused
to
go
round
i
found
myself
about
five
miles
from
here
with
an
absolutely
immobile
said
hoopdriver
trying
to
seem
intelligent
and
jessie
glanced
at
this
insane
person
appears
said
the
clergyman
satisfied
with
the
effect
he
had
created
my
man
carefully
washed
out
the
bearings
with
paraffin
and
let
the
machine
dry
without
oiling
it
again
the
consequence
was
that
they
became
heated
to
a
considerable
temperature
and
jammed
even
at
the
outset
the
machine
ran
stiffly
as
well
as
noisily
and
i
being
inclined
to
ascribe
this
stiffness
to
my
own
lassitude
merely
redoubled
my
work
all
round
said
hoopdriver
could
scarcely
put
it
more
appropriately
it
is
my
rule
of
life
to
do
whatever
i
find
to
do
with
all
my
might
i
believe
indeed
that
the
bearings
became
red
hot
finally
one
of
the
wheels
jammed
together
a
side
wheel
it
was
so
that
its
stoppage
necessitated
an
inversion
of
the
entire
apparatus
an
inversion
in
which
i
that
you
went
over
said
hoopdriver
suddenly
much
amused
and
not
brooking
my
defeat
i
suffered
repeatedly
you
may
understand
perhaps
a
natural
impatience
i
expostulated
playfully
of
course
happily
the
road
was
not
overlooked
finally
the
entire
apparatus
became
rigid
and
i
abandoned
the
unequal
contest
for
all
practical
purposes
the
tricycle
was
no
better
than
a
heavy
chair
without
castors
it
was
a
case
of
hauling
or
the
nutriment
appeared
in
the
doorway
miles
said
the
clergyman
he
began
at
once
to
eat
bread
and
butter
vigorously
he
said
am
an
eupeptic
energetic
sort
of
person
on
principle
i
would
all
men
were
the
best
way
agreed
hoopdriver
and
the
conversation
gave
precedence
to
bread
and
butter
said
the
clergyman
presently
stirring
his
tea
thoughtfully
the
tannin
in
tea
and
renders
it
easy
of
a
useful
sort
of
thing
to
know
said
hoopdriver
are
altogether
welcome
said
the
clergyman
biting
generously
at
two
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
folded
together
in
the
afternoon
our
two
wanderers
rode
on
at
an
easy
pace
towards
stoney
cross
conversation
languished
the
topic
of
south
africa
being
in
abeyance
hoopdriver
was
silenced
by
disagreeable
thoughts
he
had
changed
the
last
sovereign
at
ringwood
the
fact
had
come
upon
him
suddenly
now
too
late
he
was
reflecting
upon
his
resources
there
was
twenty
pounds
or
more
in
the
post
office
savings
bank
in
putney
but
his
book
was
locked
up
in
his
box
at
the
antrobus
establishment
else
this
infatuated
man
would
certainly
have
surreptitiously
withdrawn
the
entire
sum
in
order
to
prolong
these
journeyings
even
for
a
few
days
as
it
was
the
shadow
of
the
end
fell
across
his
happiness
strangely
enough
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
and
the
collapse
he
was
still
in
a
curious
emotional
state
that
was
certainly
not
misery
he
was
forgetting
his
imaginings
and
posings
forgetting
himself
altogether
in
his
growing
appreciation
of
his
companion
the
most
tangible
trouble
in
his
mind
was
the
necessity
of
breaking
the
matter
to
her
a
long
stretch
up
hill
tired
them
long
before
stoney
cross
was
reached
and
they
dismounted
and
sat
under
the
shade
of
a
little
oak
tree
near
the
crest
the
road
looped
on
itself
so
that
looking
back
it
sloped
below
them
up
to
the
right
and
then
came
towards
them
about
them
grew
a
rich
heather
with
stunted
oaks
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
ditch
along
the
roadside
and
this
road
was
sandy
below
the
steepness
of
the
hill
however
it
was
grey
and
barred
with
shadows
for
there
the
trees
clustered
thick
and
tall
hoopdriver
fumbled
clumsily
with
his
cigarettes
a
thing
i
got
to
tell
you
he
said
trying
to
be
perfectly
calm
she
said
like
to
jest
discuss
your
plans
a
bit
very
unsettled
said
jessie
are
thinking
of
writing
books
doing
journalism
or
teaching
or
something
like
keeping
yourself
independent
of
your
stepmother
it
take
now
to
get
anything
of
that
sort
to
do
know
at
all
i
believe
there
are
a
great
many
women
journalists
and
sanitary
inspectors
and
artists
but
i
suppose
it
takes
time
women
you
know
edit
most
papers
nowadays
george
egerton
says
i
ought
i
suppose
to
communicate
with
a
literary
course
said
hoopdriver
very
suitable
work
not
being
heavy
like
the
heavy
brain
labour
you
must
hurt
you
said
hoopdriver
turning
a
compliment
like
this
he
said
ending
a
pause
a
juiced
nuisance
alluding
to
these
matters
but
we
got
very
little
more
he
perceived
that
jessie
started
though
he
did
not
look
at
her
was
counting
of
course
on
your
writing
and
your
being
able
to
take
some
action
some
was
a
phrase
he
had
learnt
at
his
last
said
jessie
think
of
a
tandem
bicycle
said
hoopdriver
abruptly
and
pointing
with
his
cigarette
she
looked
and
saw
two
little
figures
emerging
from
among
the
trees
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
the
riders
were
bowed
sternly
over
their
work
and
made
a
gallant
but
unsuccessful
attempt
to
take
the
rise
the
machine
was
evidently
too
highly
geared
for
hill
climbing
and
presently
the
rearmost
rider
rose
on
his
saddle
and
hopped
off
leaving
his
companion
to
any
fate
he
found
proper
the
foremost
rider
was
a
man
unused
to
such
machines
and
apparently
undecided
how
to
dismount
he
wabbled
a
few
yards
up
the
hill
with
a
long
tail
of
machine
wabbling
behind
him
finally
he
made
an
attempt
to
jump
off
as
one
does
off
a
single
bicycle
hit
his
boot
against
the
backbone
and
collapsed
heavily
falling
on
his
shoulder
she
stood
up
me
she
said
hope
he
the
second
rider
went
to
the
assistance
of
the
fallen
man
hoopdriver
stood
up
too
the
lank
shaky
machine
was
lifted
up
and
wheeled
out
of
the
way
and
then
the
fallen
rider
being
assisted
got
up
slowly
and
stood
rubbing
his
arm
no
serious
injury
seemed
to
be
done
to
the
man
and
the
couple
presently
turned
their
attention
to
the
machine
by
the
roadside
they
were
not
in
cycling
clothes
hoopdriver
observed
one
wore
the
grotesque
raiment
for
which
the
cockney
discovery
of
the
game
of
golf
seems
indirectly
blamable
even
at
this
distance
the
flopping
flatness
of
his
cap
the
bright
brown
leather
at
the
top
of
his
calves
and
the
chequering
of
his
stockings
were
perceptible
the
other
the
rear
rider
was
a
slender
little
man
in
grey
said
hoopdriver
jessie
stood
staring
and
a
veil
of
thought
dropped
over
her
eyes
she
no
longer
regarded
the
two
men
who
were
now
tinkering
at
the
machine
down
below
there
much
have
you
she
said
he
thrust
his
right
hand
into
his
pocket
and
produced
six
coins
counted
them
with
his
left
index
finger
and
held
them
out
to
her
four
half
said
hoopdriver
have
half
a
sovereign
she
said
bill
wherever
we
stop
the
hiatus
was
more
eloquent
than
many
words
never
thought
of
money
coming
in
to
stop
us
like
this
said
jessie
a
juiced
said
jessie
it
possible
surely
conventionality
may
only
people
of
means
live
their
own
lives
i
never
thought
pause
some
more
cyclists
coming
said
hoopdriver
the
two
men
were
both
busy
with
their
bicycle
still
but
now
from
among
the
trees
emerged
the
massive
bulk
of
a
tandem
ridden
by
a
slender
woman
in
grey
and
a
burly
man
in
a
norfolk
jacket
following
close
upon
this
came
lank
black
figure
in
a
piebald
straw
hat
riding
a
tricycle
of
antiquated
pattern
with
two
large
wheels
in
front
the
man
in
grey
remained
bowed
over
the
bicycle
with
his
stomach
resting
on
the
saddle
but
his
companion
stood
up
and
addressed
some
remark
to
the
tricycle
riders
then
it
seemed
as
if
he
pointed
up
hill
to
where
hoopdriver
and
his
companion
stood
side
by
side
a
still
odder
thing
followed
the
lady
in
grey
took
out
her
handkerchief
appeared
to
wave
it
for
a
moment
and
then
at
a
hasty
motion
from
her
companion
the
white
signal
vanished
said
jessie
peering
under
her
hand
never
the
tandem
tricycle
began
to
ascend
the
hill
quartering
elaborately
from
side
to
side
to
ease
the
ascent
it
was
evident
from
his
heaving
shoulders
and
depressed
head
that
the
burly
gentleman
was
exerting
himself
the
clerical
person
on
the
tricycle
assumed
the
shape
of
a
note
of
interrogation
then
on
the
heels
of
this
procession
came
a
dogcart
driven
by
a
man
in
a
billycock
hat
and
containing
a
lady
in
dark
green
like
some
sort
of
excursion
said
hoopdriver
jessie
did
not
answer
she
was
still
peering
under
her
hand
she
said
the
efforts
were
becoming
convulsive
with
a
curious
jerking
motion
the
tricycle
he
rode
twisted
round
upon
itself
and
he
partly
dismounted
and
partly
fell
off
he
turned
his
machine
up
hill
again
immediately
and
began
to
wheel
it
then
the
burly
gentleman
dismounted
and
with
a
courtly
attentiveness
assisted
the
lady
in
grey
to
alight
there
was
some
little
difference
of
opinion
as
to
assistance
she
so
clearly
wished
to
help
push
finally
she
gave
in
and
the
burly
gentleman
began
impelling
the
machine
up
hill
by
his
own
unaided
strength
his
face
made
a
dot
of
brilliant
colour
among
the
greys
and
greens
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
tandem
bicycle
was
now
it
seems
repaired
and
this
joined
the
tail
of
the
procession
its
riders
walking
behind
the
dogcart
from
which
the
lady
in
green
and
the
driver
had
now
descended
hoopdriver
said
jessie
people
almost
sure
said
hoopdriver
reading
the
rest
in
her
face
and
he
turned
to
pick
up
his
machine
at
once
then
he
dropped
it
and
assisted
her
to
mount
at
the
sight
of
jessie
mounting
against
the
sky
line
the
people
coming
up
the
hill
suddenly
became
excited
and
ended
doubts
at
once
two
handkerchiefs
waved
and
some
one
shouted
the
riders
of
the
tandem
bicycle
began
to
run
it
up
hill
past
the
other
vehicles
but
our
young
people
did
not
wait
for
further
developments
of
the
pursuit
in
another
moment
they
were
out
of
sight
riding
hard
down
a
steady
incline
towards
stoney
cross
before
they
had
dropped
among
the
trees
out
of
sight
of
the
hill
brow
jessie
looked
back
and
saw
the
tandem
rising
over
the
crest
with
its
rear
rider
just
tumbling
into
the
saddle
coming
she
said
and
bent
her
head
over
her
handles
in
true
professional
style
they
whirled
down
into
the
valley
over
a
white
bridge
and
saw
ahead
of
them
a
number
of
shaggy
little
ponies
frisking
in
the
roadway
involuntarily
they
slackened
said
hoopdriver
and
the
ponies
kicked
up
their
heels
derisively
at
that
hoopdriver
lost
his
temper
and
charged
at
them
narrowly
missed
one
and
sent
them
jumping
the
ditch
into
the
bracken
under
the
trees
leaving
the
way
clear
for
jessie
then
the
road
rose
quietly
but
persistently
the
treadles
grew
heavy
and
breath
sounded
like
a
saw
the
tandem
appeared
making
frightful
exertions
at
the
foot
while
the
chase
was
still
climbing
then
thank
heaven
a
crest
and
a
stretch
of
up
and
down
road
whose
only
disadvantage
was
its
pitiless
exposure
to
the
afternoon
sun
the
tandem
apparently
dismounted
at
the
hill
and
did
not
appear
against
the
hot
blue
sky
until
they
were
already
near
some
trees
and
a
good
mile
away
gaining
said
hoopdriver
with
a
little
niagara
of
perspiration
dropping
from
brow
to
cheek
hill
but
that
was
their
only
gleam
of
success
they
were
both
nearly
spent
hoopdriver
indeed
was
quite
spent
and
only
a
feeling
of
shame
prolonged
the
liquidation
of
his
bankrupt
physique
from
that
point
the
tandem
grained
upon
them
steadily
at
the
rufus
stone
it
was
scarcely
a
hundred
yards
behind
then
one
desperate
spurt
and
they
found
themselves
upon
a
steady
downhill
stretch
among
thick
pine
woods
downhill
nothing
can
beat
a
highly
geared
tandem
bicycle
automatically
hoopdriver
put
up
his
feet
and
jessie
slackened
her
pace
in
another
moment
they
heard
the
swish
of
the
fat
pneumatics
behind
them
and
the
tandem
passed
hoopdriver
and
drew
alongside
jessie
hoopdriver
felt
a
mad
impulse
to
collide
with
this
abominable
machine
as
it
passed
him
his
only
consolation
was
to
notice
that
its
riders
riding
violently
were
quite
as
dishevelled
as
himself
and
smothered
in
sandy
white
dust
abruptly
jessie
stopped
and
dismounted
and
the
tandem
riders
shot
panting
past
them
downhill
said
dangle
who
was
riding
behind
and
stood
up
on
the
pedals
for
a
moment
the
velocity
of
the
thing
increased
and
then
they
saw
the
dust
fly
from
the
brake
as
it
came
down
on
the
front
tire
right
leg
floundered
in
the
air
as
he
came
off
in
the
road
the
tandem
wobbled
it
cried
phipps
over
his
shoulder
going
on
downhill
get
off
if
you
hold
he
put
on
the
brake
until
the
machine
stopped
almost
dead
and
then
feeling
unstable
began
to
pedal
again
dangle
shouted
after
him
out
your
foot
man
said
dangle
in
this
way
the
tandem
riders
were
carried
a
good
hundred
yards
or
more
beyond
their
quarry
then
phipps
realized
his
possibilities
slacked
up
with
the
brake
and
let
the
thing
go
over
sideways
dropping
on
to
his
right
foot
with
his
left
leg
still
over
the
saddle
and
still
holding
the
handles
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
began
addressing
uncomplimentary
remarks
to
dangle
only
think
of
yourself
said
phipps
with
a
florid
face
have
forgotten
us
said
jessie
turning
her
machine
was
a
road
at
the
top
of
the
hill
to
lyndhurst
said
hoopdriver
following
her
example
no
good
the
money
we
must
give
it
up
but
let
us
go
back
to
that
hotel
at
rufus
stone
i
see
why
we
should
be
led
so
to
the
consternation
of
the
tandem
riders
jessie
and
her
companion
mounted
and
rode
quietly
back
up
the
hill
again
as
they
dismounted
at
the
hotel
entrance
the
tandem
overtook
them
and
immediately
afterwards
the
dogcart
came
into
view
in
pursuit
dangle
jumped
off
milton
i
believe
said
dangle
panting
and
raising
a
damp
cap
from
his
wet
and
matted
hair
say
said
phipps
receding
involuntarily
go
doing
it
again
dangle
help
a
minute
said
dangle
and
ran
after
his
colleague
jessie
leant
her
machine
against
the
wall
and
went
into
the
hotel
entrance
hoopdriver
remained
in
the
hotel
entrance
limp
but
defiant
xxxviii
at
the
rufus
stone
he
folded
his
arms
as
dangle
and
phipps
returned
towards
him
phipps
was
abashed
by
his
inability
to
cope
with
the
tandem
which
he
was
now
wheeling
but
dangle
was
inclined
to
be
quarrelsome
milton
he
said
briefly
hoopdriver
bowed
over
his
folded
arms
milton
within
said
dangle
not
to
be
disturved
said
hoopdriver
are
a
scoundrel
sir
said
dangle
your
service
said
hoopdriver
awaits
stepmother
dangle
hesitated
will
be
here
immediately
he
said
is
her
friend
miss
hoopdriver
unfolded
his
arms
slowly
and
with
an
air
of
immense
calm
thrust
his
hands
into
his
breeches
pockets
then
with
one
of
those
fatal
hesitations
of
his
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
attitude
was
merely
vulgarly
defiant
he
withdrew
both
returned
one
and
pulled
at
the
insufficient
moustache
with
the
other
miss
mergle
caught
him
in
confusion
this
the
man
she
said
to
dangle
and
forthwith
dare
you
sir
how
dare
you
face
me
that
poor
girl
will
permit
me
to
observe
began
hoopdriver
with
a
splendid
drawl
seeing
himself
for
the
first
time
in
all
this
business
as
a
romantic
villain
said
miss
mergle
unexpectedly
striking
him
about
the
midriff
with
her
extended
palms
and
sending
him
staggering
backward
into
the
hall
of
the
hotel
me
pass
said
miss
mergle
in
towering
indignation
dare
you
resist
my
passage
and
so
swept
by
him
and
into
the
wherein
jessie
had
sought
refuge
as
hoopdriver
struggled
for
equilibrium
with
the
dangle
and
phipps
roused
from
their
inertia
by
miss
activity
came
in
upon
her
heels
phipps
leading
dare
you
prevent
that
lady
passing
said
phipps
hoopdriver
looked
obstinate
and
to
sense
dangerous
but
he
made
no
answer
a
waiter
in
full
bloom
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
passage
guardant
is
men
of
your
stamp
sir
said
phipps
discredit
hoopdriver
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
the
juice
are
you
shouted
hoopdriver
fiercely
are
you
sir
retorted
phipps
are
you
the
question
what
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
wandering
at
large
with
a
young
lady
under
age
speak
to
him
said
dangle
not
to
tell
all
my
secrets
to
any
one
who
comes
at
me
said
hoopdriver
and
added
fiercely
that
i
tell
you
he
and
phipps
stood
legs
apart
and
both
looking
exceedingly
fierce
at
one
another
and
heaven
alone
knows
what
might
not
have
happened
if
the
long
clergyman
had
not
appeared
in
the
doorway
heated
but
deliberate
anachronism
said
the
long
clergyman
in
the
doorway
apparently
still
suffering
from
the
antiquated
prejudice
that
demanded
a
third
wheel
and
a
black
coat
from
a
clerical
rider
he
looked
at
phipps
and
hoopdriver
for
a
moment
then
extending
his
hand
towards
the
latter
he
waved
it
up
and
down
three
times
saying
tchak
tchak
very
deliberately
as
he
did
so
then
with
a
concluding
and
a
gesture
of
repugnance
he
passed
on
into
the
from
which
the
voice
of
miss
mergle
was
distinctly
audible
remarking
that
the
weather
was
extremely
hot
even
for
the
time
of
year
this
expression
of
extreme
disapprobation
had
a
very
demoralizing
effect
upon
hoopdriver
a
demoralization
that
was
immediately
completed
by
the
advent
of
the
massive
widgery
this
the
man
said
widgery
very
grimly
and
producing
a
special
voice
for
the
occasion
from
somewhere
deep
in
his
neck
hurt
him
said
milton
with
clasped
hands
much
wrong
he
has
done
her
no
violence
many
more
of
you
said
hoopdriver
at
bay
before
the
umbrella
stand
is
she
what
has
he
done
with
her
said
milton
not
going
to
stand
here
and
be
insulted
by
a
lot
of
strangers
said
hoopdriver
you
think
worry
hoopdriver
said
jessie
suddenly
appearing
in
the
door
of
the
here
her
face
was
white
milton
said
something
about
her
child
and
made
an
emotional
charge
at
jessie
the
embrace
vanished
into
the
widgery
moved
as
if
to
follow
and
hesitated
better
make
yourself
scarce
he
said
to
hoopdriver
do
anything
of
the
kind
said
hoopdriver
with
a
catching
of
the
breath
here
defending
that
young
done
her
enough
mischief
i
should
think
said
widgery
suddenly
walking
towards
the
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
leaving
dangle
and
phipps
with
hoopdriver
said
phipps
threateningly
shall
go
and
sit
out
in
the
garden
said
hoopdriver
with
dignity
i
shall
make
a
row
with
him
said
dangle
and
hoopdriver
retired
unassaulted
in
almost
sobbing
dignity
xxxix
so
here
is
the
world
with
us
again
and
our
sentimental
excursion
is
over
in
the
front
of
the
rufus
stone
hotel
conceive
a
remarkable
collection
of
wheeled
instruments
watched
over
by
dangle
and
phipps
in
grave
and
stately
attitudes
and
by
the
driver
of
a
stylish
dogcart
from
ringwood
in
the
garden
behind
in
an
attitude
of
nervous
prostration
hoopdriver
was
seated
on
a
rustic
seat
through
the
open
window
of
a
private
came
a
murmur
of
voices
as
of
men
and
women
in
conference
occasionally
something
that
might
have
been
a
girlish
sob
fail
to
see
what
status
widgery
has
says
dangle
himself
in
takes
too
much
upon
himself
said
phipps
been
noticing
little
things
yesterday
and
said
dangle
and
stopped
went
to
the
cathedral
together
in
the
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
her
of
course
said
dangle
with
a
gloomy
magnanimity
he
felt
drawn
to
phipps
now
by
the
common
trouble
in
spite
of
the
chequered
legs
it
be
half
so
dull
and
heavy
said
phipps
meanwhile
within
the
clergyman
had
by
promptitude
and
dexterity
taken
the
chair
and
was
opening
the
case
against
the
unfortunate
jessie
i
regret
to
have
to
say
that
my
heroine
had
been
appalled
by
the
visible
array
of
public
opinion
against
her
excursion
to
the
pitch
of
tears
she
was
sitting
with
flushed
cheeks
and
swimming
eyes
at
the
end
of
the
table
opposite
to
the
clergyman
she
held
her
handkerchief
crumpled
up
in
her
extended
hand
milton
sat
as
near
to
her
as
possible
and
occasionally
made
little
dabs
with
her
hand
at
hand
to
indicate
forgiveness
these
advances
were
not
reciprocated
which
touched
widgery
very
much
the
lady
in
green
miss
mergle
b
a
sat
on
the
opposite
side
near
the
clergyman
she
was
the
schoolmistress
to
whom
jessie
had
written
and
who
had
immediately
precipitated
the
pursuit
upon
her
she
had
picked
up
the
clergyman
in
ringwood
and
had
told
him
everything
forthwith
having
met
him
once
at
a
british
association
meeting
he
had
immediately
constituted
himself
administrator
of
the
entire
business
widgery
having
been
foiled
in
an
attempt
to
conduct
the
proceedings
stood
with
his
legs
wide
apart
in
front
of
the
fireplace
ornament
and
looked
profound
and
sympathetic
account
of
her
adventures
was
a
chary
one
and
given
amidst
frequent
interruptions
she
surprised
herself
by
skilfully
omitting
any
allusion
to
the
bechamel
episode
she
completely
exonerated
hoopdriver
from
the
charge
of
being
more
than
an
accessory
to
her
escapade
but
public
feeling
was
heavy
against
hoopdriver
her
narrative
was
inaccurate
and
sketchy
but
happily
the
others
were
too
anxious
to
pass
opinions
to
pin
her
down
to
particulars
at
last
they
had
all
the
facts
they
would
permit
dear
young
lady
said
the
clergyman
can
only
ascribe
this
extravagant
and
regrettable
expedition
of
yours
to
the
wildest
misconceptions
of
your
place
in
the
world
and
of
your
duties
and
responsibilities
even
now
it
seems
to
me
your
present
emotion
is
due
not
so
much
to
a
real
and
sincere
penitence
for
your
disobedience
and
folly
as
to
a
positive
annoyance
at
our
most
fortunate
interference
that
said
milton
in
a
low
tone
why
did
she
go
off
like
this
said
widgery
what
want
to
jessie
made
an
attempt
to
speak
but
milton
said
and
the
ringing
tenor
of
the
clergyman
rode
triumphantly
over
the
meeting
can
not
understand
this
spirit
of
unrest
that
has
seized
upon
the
more
intelligent
portion
of
the
feminine
community
you
had
a
pleasant
home
a
most
refined
and
intelligent
lady
in
the
position
of
your
mother
to
cherish
and
protect
you
i
had
a
mother
gulped
jessie
succumbing
to
the
obvious
snare
of
and
sobbing
cherish
protect
and
advise
you
and
you
must
needs
go
out
of
it
all
alone
into
a
strange
world
of
unknown
wanted
to
learn
said
jessie
wanted
to
learn
may
you
never
have
anything
to
from
milton
very
sadly
fair
for
all
of
you
to
argue
at
me
at
once
submitted
jessie
irrelevantly
world
full
of
unknown
dangers
resumed
the
clergyman
proper
place
was
surely
the
natural
surroundings
that
are
part
of
you
you
have
been
unduly
influenced
it
is
only
too
apparent
by
a
class
of
literature
which
with
all
due
respect
to
distinguished
authoress
that
shall
be
nameless
i
must
call
the
new
woman
literature
in
that
deleterious
ingredient
of
our
book
boxes
altogether
agree
with
you
there
said
miss
mergle
throwing
her
head
back
and
regarding
him
firmly
through
her
spectacles
and
widgery
coughed
has
all
this
to
do
with
me
asked
jessie
availing
herself
of
the
interruption
point
is
said
milton
on
her
defence
in
my
books
i
want
to
do
said
jessie
to
go
about
freely
by
myself
girls
do
so
in
america
why
not
here
conditions
are
entirely
different
in
america
said
miss
mergle
we
respect
class
very
unfortunate
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
i
can
not
go
away
for
a
holiday
if
i
want
a
strange
young
man
socially
your
inferior
said
widgery
and
made
her
flush
by
his
tone
not
she
said
do
that
even
in
america
said
miss
mergle
dear
young
lady
said
the
clergyman
most
elementary
principles
of
decorum
a
day
will
come
when
you
will
better
understand
how
entirely
subservient
your
ideas
are
to
the
very
fundamentals
of
our
present
civilisation
when
you
will
better
understand
the
harrowing
anxiety
you
have
given
milton
by
this
inexplicable
flight
of
yours
we
can
only
put
things
down
at
present
in
charity
to
your
ignorance
have
to
consider
the
general
body
of
opinion
too
said
widgery
said
miss
mergle
is
no
such
thing
as
conduct
in
the
once
this
most
unfortunate
business
gets
about
said
the
clergyman
will
do
you
infinite
done
nothing
wrong
why
should
i
be
responsible
for
other
world
has
no
charity
said
milton
a
girl
said
jessie
do
let
us
stop
arguing
my
dear
young
lady
and
let
us
listen
to
reason
never
mind
how
or
why
this
conduct
of
yours
will
do
you
infinite
harm
if
once
it
is
generally
known
and
not
only
that
it
will
cause
infinite
pain
to
those
who
care
for
you
but
if
you
will
return
at
once
to
your
home
causing
it
to
be
understood
that
you
have
been
with
friends
for
these
last
few
days
lies
said
jessie
not
most
certainly
not
but
i
understand
that
is
how
your
absence
is
understood
at
present
and
there
is
no
reason
grip
tightened
on
her
handkerchief
go
back
she
said
have
it
as
i
did
before
i
want
a
room
of
my
own
what
books
i
need
to
read
to
be
free
to
go
out
by
myself
alone
teaching
said
milton
in
will
you
keep
your
promise
said
jessie
you
dictate
to
your
mother
said
widgery
stepmother
i
want
to
dictate
i
want
definite
promises
is
most
unreasonable
said
the
clergyman
well
said
jessie
swallowing
a
sob
but
with
unusual
resolution
i
go
back
my
life
is
being
frittered
away
her
have
her
way
said
widgery
room
then
all
your
men
not
to
come
down
and
talk
away
half
my
days
dear
child
if
only
to
save
you
said
milton
you
keep
your
promise
i
take
it
the
matter
is
practically
concluded
said
the
clergyman
that
you
very
properly
submit
to
return
to
your
proper
home
and
now
if
i
may
offer
a
suggestion
it
is
that
we
take
tea
freed
of
its
tannin
nothing
i
think
is
more
refreshing
and
a
train
from
lyndhurst
at
thirteen
minutes
to
six
said
widgery
unfolding
a
time
table
gives
us
about
half
an
hour
or
here
if
a
conveyance
is
obtainable
that
gelatine
lozenge
dropped
into
the
tea
cup
precipitates
the
tannin
in
the
form
of
tannate
of
gelatine
said
the
clergyman
to
miss
mergle
in
a
confidential
bray
jessie
stood
up
and
saw
through
the
window
a
depressed
head
and
shoulders
over
the
top
of
the
back
of
a
garden
seat
she
moved
towards
the
door
you
have
tea
mother
she
said
must
tell
hoopdriver
of
our
you
think
i
began
the
clergyman
said
jessie
very
rudely
jessie
you
already
are
already
breaking
the
capitulation
said
jessie
you
want
the
whole
half
hour
said
widgery
at
the
bell
minute
said
jessie
in
the
doorway
behaved
very
nobly
to
tea
said
widgery
had
may
not
have
behaved
badly
said
the
clergyman
certainly
an
astonishingly
weak
person
to
let
a
young
girl
jessie
closed
the
door
into
the
garden
meanwhile
hoopdriver
made
a
sad
figure
in
the
sunlight
outside
it
was
over
this
wonderful
excursion
of
his
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
and
with
the
swift
blow
that
separated
them
he
realised
all
that
those
days
had
done
for
him
he
tried
to
grasp
the
bearings
of
their
position
of
course
they
would
take
her
away
to
those
social
altitudes
of
hers
she
would
become
an
inaccessible
young
lady
again
would
they
let
him
say
to
her
how
extraordinary
it
had
all
been
he
recalled
the
moment
when
he
had
first
seen
her
riding
with
the
sunlight
behind
her
along
the
riverside
road
he
recalled
that
wonderful
night
at
bognor
remembering
it
as
if
everything
had
been
done
of
his
own
initiative
brave
she
had
called
him
and
afterwards
when
she
came
down
to
him
in
the
morning
kindly
quiet
but
ought
he
to
have
persuaded
her
then
to
return
to
her
home
he
remembered
some
intention
of
the
sort
now
these
people
snatched
her
away
from
him
as
though
he
was
scarcely
fit
to
live
in
the
same
world
with
her
no
more
he
was
he
felt
he
had
presumed
upon
her
worldly
ignorance
in
travelling
with
her
day
after
day
she
was
so
dainty
so
delightful
so
serene
he
began
to
recapitulate
her
expressions
the
light
of
her
eyes
the
turn
of
her
he
good
enough
to
walk
in
the
same
road
with
her
nobody
was
suppose
they
let
him
say
to
her
what
could
he
say
that
but
they
were
sure
not
to
let
her
talk
to
him
alone
her
mother
would
be
there
as
what
was
it
chaperone
never
once
had
a
chance
of
saying
what
he
felt
indeed
it
was
only
now
he
was
beginning
to
realise
what
he
felt
love
i
he
presume
it
was
worship
if
only
he
could
have
one
more
chance
he
must
have
one
more
chance
somewhere
somehow
then
he
would
pour
out
his
soul
to
her
eloquently
he
felt
eloquently
and
words
would
come
he
was
dust
under
her
feet
his
meditation
was
interrupted
by
the
click
of
a
door
handle
and
jessie
appeared
in
the
sunlight
under
the
verandah
away
from
here
she
said
to
hoopdriver
as
he
rose
to
meet
her
going
home
with
them
we
have
to
say
hoopdriver
winced
opened
and
shut
his
mouth
and
rose
without
a
word
xl
at
first
jessie
milton
and
hoopdriver
walked
away
from
the
hotel
in
silence
he
heard
a
catching
in
her
breath
and
glanced
at
her
and
saw
her
ips
pressed
tight
and
a
tear
on
her
cheek
her
face
was
hot
and
bright
she
was
looking
straight
before
her
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
and
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looked
away
from
her
intentionally
after
a
while
she
began
to
talk
they
dealt
disjointedly
with
scenery
first
and
then
with
the
means
of
she
took
his
address
at
and
promised
to
send
him
some
books
but
even
with
that
it
was
spiritless
aching
talk
hoopdriver
felt
for
the
fighting
mood
was
over
she
seemed
to
him
preoccupied
with
the
memories
of
her
late
battle
and
that
appearance
hurt
him
the
end
he
whispered
to
himself
the
they
went
into
a
hollow
and
up
a
gentle
wooded
slope
and
came
at
last
to
a
high
and
open
space
overlooking
a
wide
expanse
of
country
there
by
a
common
impulse
they
stopped
she
looked
at
her
watch
a
little
ostentatiously
they
stared
at
the
billows
of
forest
rolling
away
beneath
them
crest
beyond
crest
of
leafy
trees
fading
at
last
into
blue
ran
through
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
all
speakable
thoughts
so
she
said
presently
breaking
the
silence
comes
to
for
half
a
minute
he
did
not
answer
then
he
gathered
his
resolution
is
one
thing
i
must
she
said
surprised
and
abruptly
forgetting
the
recent
argument
ask
no
return
but
then
he
stopped
say
it
no
good
it
would
be
rot
from
me
now
i
going
to
say
anything
she
looked
at
him
with
a
startled
expression
in
her
eyes
she
said
forget
you
are
going
to
work
remember
brother
chris
you
are
my
friend
you
will
work
you
are
not
a
very
strong
man
you
know
now
you
will
forgive
me
nor
do
you
know
all
you
should
but
what
will
you
be
in
six
time
he
stared
hard
in
front
of
him
still
and
the
lines
about
his
weak
mouth
seemed
to
strengthen
he
knew
she
understood
what
he
could
not
say
work
he
said
concisely
they
stood
side
by
side
for
a
moment
then
he
said
with
a
motion
of
his
head
come
back
to
them
do
you
mind
going
back
alone
she
took
ten
seconds
to
think
she
said
and
held
out
her
hand
biting
her
nether
lip
she
whispered
he
turned
with
a
white
face
looked
into
her
eyes
took
her
hand
limply
and
then
with
a
sudden
impulse
lifted
it
to
his
lips
she
would
have
snatched
it
away
but
his
grip
tightened
to
her
movement
she
felt
the
touch
of
his
lips
and
then
he
had
dropped
her
fingers
and
turned
from
her
and
was
striding
down
the
slope
a
dozen
paces
away
his
foot
turned
in
the
lip
of
a
rabbit
hole
and
he
stumbled
forward
and
almost
fell
he
recovered
his
balance
and
went
on
not
looking
back
he
never
once
looked
back
she
stared
at
his
receding
figure
until
it
was
small
and
far
below
her
and
then
the
tears
running
over
her
eyelids
now
turned
slowly
and
walked
with
her
hands
gripped
hard
together
behind
her
towards
stoney
cross
again
did
not
know
she
whispered
to
herself
did
not
understand
even
now
no
i
do
not
xli
the
envoy
so
the
story
ends
dear
reader
hoopdriver
sprawling
down
there
among
the
bracken
must
sprawl
without
our
prying
i
think
or
listening
to
what
chances
to
his
breathing
and
of
what
came
of
it
all
of
the
six
years
and
afterwards
this
is
no
place
to
tell
in
truth
there
is
no
telling
it
for
the
years
have
still
to
run
but
if
you
see
how
a
mere
a
cad
on
castors
and
a
fool
to
boot
may
come
to
feel
the
little
insufficiencies
of
life
and
if
he
has
to
any
extent
won
your
sympathies
my
end
is
attained
if
it
is
not
attained
may
heaven
forgive
us
both
nor
will
we
follow
this
adventurous
young
lady
of
ours
back
to
her
home
at
surbiton
to
her
new
struggle
against
widgery
and
milton
combined
for
as
she
will
presently
hear
that
devoted
man
has
got
his
reward
for
her
also
your
sympathies
are
invited
the
rest
of
this
great
holiday
too
five
days
there
are
left
of
it
is
beyond
the
limits
of
our
design
you
see
fitfully
a
slender
figure
in
a
dusty
brown
suit
and
heather
mixture
stockings
and
brown
shoes
not
intended
to
be
cycled
in
flitting
londonward
through
hampshire
and
berkshire
and
surrey
going
economically
for
excellent
reasons
day
by
day
he
goes
on
riding
fitfully
and
for
the
most
part
through
but
getting
a
few
miles
to
the
every
day
he
is
a
person
with
a
nose
hot
and
tanned
at
the
bridge
with
unwonted
exposure
and
brown
fists
a
musing
expression
sits
upon
the
face
of
this
rider
you
observe
sometimes
he
whistles
noiselessly
to
himself
sometimes
he
speaks
aloud
juiced
good
try
anyhow
you
hear
and
sometimes
and
that
too
often
for
my
liking
he
looks
irritable
and
hopeless
know
he
says
know
over
and
done
it
in
me
you
man
enough
hoopdriver
look
at
yer
silly
hands
oh
my
god
and
a
gust
of
passion
comes
upon
him
and
he
rides
furiously
for
a
space
sometimes
again
his
face
softens
if
not
to
see
her
going
to
lend
me
books
he
thinks
and
gets
such
comfort
as
he
can
then
again
books
once
or
twice
triumphant
memories
of
the
earlier
incidents
nerve
his
face
for
a
while
put
the
on
his
little
game
he
remarks
did
that
and
one
might
even
call
him
happy
in
these
phases
and
the
machine
you
notice
has
been
grey
and
carries
a
sonorous
gong
this
figure
passes
through
basingstoke
and
bagshot
staines
hampton
and
richmond
at
last
in
putney
high
street
glowing
with
the
warmth
of
an
august
sunset
and
with
all
the
boys
busy
shutting
up
shop
and
the
work
girls
going
home
and
the
shop
folks
peeping
abroad
and
the
white
full
of
late
clerks
and
city
folk
rumbling
home
to
their
dinners
we
part
from
him
he
is
back
the
early
rising
the
dusting
and
drudgery
begin
again
but
with
a
difference
with
wonderful
memories
and
still
more
wonderful
desires
and
ambitions
replacing
those
discrepant
dreams
he
turns
out
of
the
high
street
at
the
corner
dismounts
with
a
sigh
and
pushes
his
machine
through
the
gates
of
the
antrobus
stable
yard
as
the
apprentice
with
the
high
collar
holds
them
open
there
are
words
of
greeting
coast
you
hear
and
weather
he
sighs
swapped
him
off
for
a
couple
of
sovs
a
juiced
good
the
gate
closes
upon
him
with
a
slam
and
he
vanishes
from
our
ken
