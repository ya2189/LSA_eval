more
time
with

her
little

full
of

katie

she
whispered
faintly
and
turned
away
her
face
for
the
new
moon

shining
into
her
eyes
let
we
get
up
cried
katie
shaking
her
by
the
shoulders

said
flyaway
and
dropped
to
sleep
again
dotty
was
really
sorry
to
leave
aunt
maria
pleasant
house
and
the
charming
novelties
of
out
west
phebe
said
she
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
when
she
received
the
tomato
pincushion
i
like
you
just
as
well
as
if
you
was
black
and
katinka
i

as
if

cook
better
things
than
norah
if

nice
this
speech
pleased
katinka
so
much
that
she
patted
the
letter
o
on
each
side
of
her
head
with
great
satisfaction
and
was
very
sorry
she
had
not
made
some
chocolate
cakes
for
dotty
to
eat
in
the
cars
uncle
henry
did
not
like
to
part
with
his
bright
little
niece
she
had
been
so
docile
and
affectionate
during
her
visit
that
he
began
to
think
her
very
lovely
and
to
wonder
he
had
ever
supposed
she
had
a
wayward
temper
the
ride
to
indianapolis
was
a
very
pleasant
one
katie
thought
she
had
the
care
of
the
whole
party
and
her
little
face
was
full
of
anxiety
do
you
tubble
yourself
mamma
said
she
look
out
the
winner
and
tell
you
when
we
get
there
do
let
her
fall
out
horace
said
clifford
i
have
a
headache
and
you
must
watch
her
has
you
got
a
headache
mamma
i
solly
lean
me
mamma
horace
wished
the
conductor
had
been
in
that
car
so
he
could
have
seen
miss
flyaway
trying
to
prop
her
mother
head
against
her
own
morsel
of
a
shoulder
about
as
secure
a
as
a
piece
of
when
it
be
said
she
at
last
growing
very
tired
of
so
much
care
and
beginning
to
think
was
a
long
way
off
but
they
arrived
there
at
last
and
found
parlin
waiting
for
them
at
the
depot
after
they
had
all
been
refreshed
by
a
nice
dinner
and
flyaway
had
caught
a
nap
which
took
her
about
as
long
as
it
takes
a
fly
to
eat
his
breakfast
then
parlin
suggested
that
they
should
visit
the
blind
asylum
is
it
where
they
make
blinds
asked
dotty
o
no
replied
parlin
it
is
a
school
where
blind
children
are
taught
what
is
they
when
they
is
blind
uncle
eddard
they
do
see
my
dear
flyaway
shut
her
eyes
just
to
give
herself
an
idea
of
their
condition
and
ran
against
horace
who
saved
her
from
falling
i
was
velly
blind
then
hollis
said
she
and
that
what
is
it
i
do
see
queried
dotty
i
do
see
how
people
that
ca
see
can
see
to
read
so
what
the
use
to
go
to
school
they
read
by
the
sense
of
feeling
the
letters
are
raised
said
parlin
but
here
we
are
at
the
institute
they
were
in
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
city
standing
before
some
beautiful
grounds
which
occupied
an
entire
square
and
were
enclosed
by
an
iron
fence
in
front
of
the
building
grew
trees
and
shrubs
and
on
each
side
was
a
for
the
children
why
that
house
has
windows
cried
dotty
i
do
see
what
people
want
of
windows
when
they
ca
see
nor
me
needer
echoed
katie
what
um
wants
winners
ca
see
out
of
they
went
up
a
flight
of
stone
steps
and
were
met
at
the
door
by
a
blind
who
ushered
them
into
the
visitors
parlor
is
whispered
flyaway
gazing
at
her
earnestly
her
eyes
is
shut
up
where
is
the
gone
to
clifford
sent
up
her
card
and
the
superintendent
who
knew
her
well
came
down
to
meet
her
he
was
also
but
the
children
did
not
suspect
it
they
were
much
interested
in
the
specimens
of
which
were
to
be
seen
in
the
parlin
bought
some
flowers
baskets
and
other
toys
to
carry
home
to
susy
and
prudy
horace
said
these
beads
are
strung
on
wires
and
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
do
that
with
one
eyes
shut
but
it
always
did
puzzle
me
to
see
how
blind
people
can
tell
one
color
from
another
with
the
ends
of
their
fingers
the
superintendent
smiled
that
would
be
strange
indeed
if
it
were
true
said
he
but
it
is
a
mistake
the
colors
are
put
into
separate
boxes
and
that
is
the
way
the
children
distinguish
them
i
suppose
they
are
much
happier
for
being
busy
said
parlin
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
that
they
can
be
made
useful
so
it
is
said
the
superintendent
i
am
blind
myself
and
i
know
how
necessary
employment
is
to
my
happiness
the
children
looked
up
at
the
noble
face
of
the
speaker
with
surprise
was
blind
why
does
he
wear
glasses
then
whispered
dotty
grandma
wears
because
she
can
see
a
little
and
wants
to
see
more
the
superintendent
was
amused
as
he
could
not
see
dotty
had
unconsciously
supposed
his
hearing
must
be
rather
dull
but
on
the
contrary
it
was
very
quick
and
he
had
caught
every
word
i
suppose
my
child
remarked
he
playfully
these
spectacles
of
mine
may
be
called
the
gravestones
for
my
dead
eyes
dotty
did
not
understand
this
but
she
was
very
sorry
she
had
spoken
so
loud
after
looking
at
the
as
long
as
they
liked
the
visitors
went
across
the
hall
into
the
little
ones
this
was
a
very
pleasant
place
furnished
with
nice
desks
and
at
one
end
were
containing
blind
books
with
raised
letters
horace
soon
discovered
that
the
old
testament
was
in
six
volumes
each
volume
as
large
as
a
family
bible
in
this
cheerful
room
were
twenty
or
thirty
boys
and
girls
they
looked
very
much
like
other
children
only
they
did
not
appear
to
notice
that
any
one
was
entering
and
scarcely
turned
their
heads
as
the
door
softly
opened
dotty
had
a
great
many
new
thoughts
these
unfortunate
little
ones
were
very
neatly
dressed
yet
they
had
never
seen
themselves
in
the
glass
and
how
did
they
know
whether
their
hair
was
rough
or
smooth
or
parted
in
the
middle
how
could
they
tell
when
they
dropped
on
those
nice
clothes
i
do
see
thought
dotty
how
they
know
when
to
go
to
bed
o
dear
i
should
get
up
in
the
night
and
think
was
morning
only
i
should
was
night
all
the
whole
time
and
not
any
stars
either
when
my
father
spoke
to
me
i
should
think
it
was
my
mother
and
say
and
i
should
think
prudy
was
a
with
a
wig
on
and
never
saw
a
flower
nor
a
tree
o
dear
while
she
was
musing
in
this
way
and
gazing
about
her
with
eager
eyes
which
saw
everything
the
children
were
reading
aloud
from
their
books
it
was
strange
to
see
their
small
fingers
fly
so
rapidly
over
the
pages
horace
said
it
was
a
touching
sight
i
wonder
went
on
dotty
to
herself
if
they
should
tease
god
very
hard
would
he
let
their
eyes
come
again
no
i
not
then
she
reflected
further
that
perhaps
they
were
glad
to
be
blind
she
hoped
so
the
teacher
now
called
out
a
class
in
geography
and
began
to
ask
questions
what
can
you
tell
me
about
the
inhabitants
of
utah
said
she
i
know
spoke
up
a
little
boy
with
black
hair
and
eyes
which
would
have
been
bright
if
the
lids
had
not
shut
them
out
of
sight
i
know
utah
is
inhabited
by
a
religious
insect
called
mormons
the
superintendent
and
visitors
knew
that
he
meant
and
they
laughed
at
the
mistake
all
but
dotty
and
flyaway
who
did
not
consider
it
funny
at
all
flyaway
was
seated
in
a
chair
busily
engaged
in
picking
dirt
out
of
the
heels
of
her
boots
with
a
pin
horace
was
much
interested
in
the
atlases
and
globes
upon
the
surface
of
which
the
land
rose
up
higher
than
the
water
and
the
deserts
were
powdered
with
sand
these
blind
children
could
travel
all
about
the
world
with
their
fingers
as
well
as
he
could
with
eyes
and
a
pointer
the
teacher
a
young
lady
was
quite
pleased
when
parlin
said
to
her
i
see
very
little
difference
between
this
and
the
portland
schools
for
small
children
she
wished
and
so
did
the
teachers
in
the
other
three
divisions
to
have
the
pupils
almost
forget
they
were
blind
she
allowed
them
to
sing
and
recite
poetry
for
the
entertainment
of
their
visitors
some
of
them
had
very
sweet
voices
and
clifford
listened
with
tears
their
singing
recalled
to
her
mind
the
memory
of
beautiful
things
as
music
always
does
and
then
she
remembered
that
through
their
whole
lives
these
children
must
grope
in
darkness
she
felt
more
sorrowful
for
them
than
they
felt
for
themselves
these
dear
little
souls
who
would
never
see
the
sun
were
very
happy
and
some
of
them
really
supposed
it
was
delightful
to
be
blind
their
teacher
desired
them
to
come
forward
if
they
chose
and
repeat
sentences
of
their
own
composing
some
things
they
said
were
very
odd
one
bright
little
girl
remarked
very
gravely
happy
are
the
blind
for
they
see
no
ghosts
this
made
her
companions
all
laugh
yes
that
true
thought
dotty
if
people
should
come
in
here
with
ever
so
many
pumpkins
and
candles
inside
these
blind
children
would
know
it
they
could
be
frightened
i
wonder
where
they
ever
heard
of
ghosts
there
must
have
been
some
naughty
girl
here
like
angeline
chapter
ii
emily
trials
at
three
the
little
blind
girls
all
went
out
to
play
in
one
yard
and
the
little
blind
boys
in
the
other
goin
out
to
take
their
air
said
katie
then
she
and
dotty
followed
the
girls
in
respectful
silence
almost
every
one
had
a
particular
friend
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
certain
any
two
friends
were
to
find
one
another
by
the
sense
of
feeling
and
walk
off
together
arm
in
arm
it
was
strange
too
that
they
could
move
so
fast
without
hitting
things
and
falling
down
when
i
am
blindfolded
thought
dotty
it
makes
me
dizzy
and
i
know
where
i
am
when
i
think
anything
is
there
the
next
i
know
i
come
against
it
and
make
my
nose
bleed
she
was
not
aware
that
while
the
most
of
these
children
were
blind
there
were
others
who
had
a
little
glimmering
of
eyesight
the
world
was
night
to
some
of
them
to
others
twilight
they
did
not
know
dotty
and
katie
were
following
them
and
they
chatted
away
as
if
they
were
quite
by
themselves
emily
have
you
seen
my
lilly
viola
said
one
little
girl
to
another
miss
percival
has
dressed
her
all
over
new
with
a
red
and
a
black
hat
the
speaker
was
a
lovely
little
girl
with
curly
hair
but
her
eyes
were
closed
and
dotty
wondered
what
made
her
talk
of
seeing
a
doll
emily
took
lilly
viola
and
travelled
all
over
her
hat
and
dress
and
kid
boots
with
her
fingers
yes
octavia
said
she
she
is
very
pretty
ever
so
much
prettier
than
my
victoria
josephine
then
both
the
little
girls
talked
sweet
nothings
to
their
rag
babies
just
like
any
other
little
girls
is
the
dollies
too
asked
katie
making
a
dash
forward
and
peeping
into
the
cloth
face
of
a
baby
the
little
mamma
whose
name
was
octavia
smiled
and
taking
katie
by
the
shoulders
began
to
touch
her
all
over
with
her
fingers
dear
little
thing
said
she
what
soft
hair
yes
replied
katie
velly
soft
do
you
wish
though
you
could
see
my
new
dress
it
got
little
blue
yoses
all
over
it
illustration
dotty
and
katie
visiting
the
blind

octavia
gently
and
i

katie
and

hunnerd

asked
the
children

and

a
sweet
place
in
my
neck
too
but
my
papa
kissed
it
all
out
o
me

said
octavia
with
delight
yes
answered
dotty
very
glad
to
say
a
word
to
such
remarkable
children
as
these
yes
she
is
a
darling
and
she
has
on
a
white

and
a
hat
trimmed

her
flyaway
because
she
ca

a
minute
yes

free
five

minutes
cried
katie
and
to
prove
it
she
flew
across
the
yard
and
began
to
pry
into
one
of
the
she
does
mean
to
be
naughty
you
must
scuse
her
spoke
up
dotty
very
loud
for
she
still
held
unconsciously
to
the
idea
that
blind
people
must
have
dull
ears
she
is
a
nice
baby
but
i
you
do
know
there
are
some
in
this
yard
and
she
get
into
mischief
if
i
do
watch
her
why

said
little
emily
whose
did
you
think
they
were
yours
asked
dotty
in
surprise
can

play
emily
laughed
merrily
why
not
did
you
think
we
were
sick
dotty
did
not
answer

emily
that

the
atlantic
dotty
who
could
only
stammer
over
the
first
reader
at
her
mother
knee
was
obliged
to
confess
that
she
had
never
made
rollo
acquaintance
we
have
books
read
to
us
said
emily
in
the
we
go
into
the
and
there
we
sit
with
the
in
our
laps
making
baskets
and
then
our
teacher
reads
to
us
out
of
a
book
or
tells
us
a
story
that
is
very
nice
said
dotty
people
do
read
to
me
much
no
of
course
not
because
you
can
see
people
are
kinder
to
blind
children
did
you
know
it
i
glad
i
had
my
eyes
put
out
for
if
they
had
been
put
out
i
should
have
come
here
where
should
you
have
gone
then
i
should
have
gone
anywhere
i
should
just
have
staid
at
home
do
you
like
to
stay
at
home
emily
shrugged
her
shoulders
my
paw
killed
a
man
i
do
know
what
a
paw
is
said
dotty
o
flyaway
clifford
you
broken
a
teapot
no
matter
said
emily
kindly
was
made
out
of
a
poppy
do
you
know
what
a
paw
is
why
it
a
in
spite
of
this
clear
explanation
dotty
did
not
understand
any
better
than
before
it
was
the
man
that
married
my
maw
only
maw
died
and
then
there
was
another
one
and
she
scolded
and
shook
me
o
i
you
mean
a
father
mother
now
i
know
i
want
to
tell
you
pursued
emily
who
loved
to
talk
to
strangers
she
did
care
if
i
was
blind
she
used
to
shake
me
just
the
same
and
my
paw
had
fits
the
other
children
who
had
often
heard
this
story
did
not
listen
to
it
with
great
interest
but
went
on
with
their
various
plays
leaving
emily
and
dotty
standing
together
before
emily
yes
my
paw
had
fits
i
knew
when
they
were
coming
for
i
could
smell
them
in
the
bottle
fits
in
a
bottle
it
was
something
he
drank
out
of
a
bottle
that
made
him
have
the
fits
you
are
so
little
that
you
could
understand
and
then
he
was
cross
and
once
he
killed
a
man
but
he
did
go
to
then
he
was
guilty
said
dotty
in
a
solemn
tone
did
they
take
him
to
the
and
hang
him
no
of
course
they
would
hang
they
said
it
was
the
third
degree
and
they
sent
him
to
the
state
prison
o
is
your
father
in
the
state
prison
dotty
thought
if
her
father
were
in
such
a
dreadful
place
and
she
herself
were
blind
she
should
not
wish
to
live
but
here
was
emily
looking
just
as
happy
as
anybody
else
indeed
the
little
girl
was
rather
proud
of
being
the
daughter
of
such
a
wicked
man
she
had
been
pitied
so
much
for
her
misfortunes
that
she
had
come
to
regard
herself
as
quite
a
remarkable
person
she
could
not
see
the
horror
in
dotty
face
but
she
could
detect
it
in
her
voice
so
she
went
on
well
satisfied
there
is
any
other
little
girl
in
this
school
that
has
had
so
much
trouble
as
i
have
a
lady
told
me
it
was
because
god
wanted
to
make
a
good
woman
of
me
and
that
was
why
it
was
does
it
make
people
good
to
have
trouble
asked
dotty
trying
to
remember
what
dreadful
trials
had
happened
to
herself
our
house
was
burnt
all
up
and
i
felt
dreadfully
i
lost
a
too
with
gold
rims
i
did
know
i
was
any
better
for
that
o
you
see
it
is
very
awful
to
have
a
house
burnt
up
said
emily
not
half
so
awful
as
it
is
to
have
your
eyes
put
out
but
then
emily
i
been
sick
and
had
the
sore
throat
and
almost
drowned
and
and
the
when
i
was
a
baby
what
is
your
name
asked
emily
and
how
old
are
you
my
name
is
alice
parlin
and
i
am
six
years
old
why
i
am
nine
and
see
your
head
only
comes
under
my
chin
of
course
it
does
replied
dotty
with
some
spirit
i
would
be
as
tall
as
you
are
for
anything
and
me
only
six
going
on
seven
i
suppose
your
paw
is
rich
and
good
to
you
and
you
have
everything
you
want
do
you
alice
no
my
father
is
rich
at
all
emily
and
i
do
have
many
things
no
indeed
replied
miss
dimple
with
a
desire
to
plume
herself
on
her
poverty
and
privations
my
aunt
has
two
girls
but
we
do
only
our
norah
and
mother
never
lets
me
put
any
sirreup
on
my
hangerjif
sundays
i
think
we
pretty
poor
dotty
meant
all
she
said
she
had
now
become
a
traveller
had
seen
a
great
many
elegant
things
and
when
she
thought
of
her
home
in
portland
it
seemed
to
her
plainer
and
less
attractive
than
it
had
ever
seemed
before
i
do
know
what
you
would
think
said
emily
counting
over
her
trials
on
her
fingers
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
diamond
rings
if
you
have
anything
to
eat
but
brown
bread
and
molasses
i
guess
you
think
was
pretty
poor
and
got
the
molasses
all
over
your
face
because
you
could
see
to
put
it
in
your
mouth
and
had
that
woman
shake
you
every
time
you
spoke
and
your
paw
in
state
prison
because
he
killed
a
man
o
no
repeated
she
with
triumph
there
is
any
other
little
girl
in
this
school
that
had
so
much
trouble
as
i
have
no
i
not
responded
dotty
giving
up
the
attempt
to
compare
trials
with
such
a
wretched
being
but
then
i
may
be
blind
some
time
too
a
chicken
will
pick
my
eyes
out
a
cross
hen
flew
right
up
and
did
so
to
a
boy
emily
paid
no
attention
to
this
foolish
remark
my
paw
writes
me
letters
said
she
here
is
one
in
my
pocket
would
you
like
to
read
it
dotty
took
the
letter
which
was
badly
written
and
worse
spelled
can
you
read
it
asked
emily
after
dotty
had
turned
it
over
for
some
moments
in
silence
no
i
can
not
replied
dotty
very
much
ashamed
but
i
going
to
school
by
and
by
and
then
i
shall
learn
everything
o
no
matter
if
you
ca
read
it
to
me
my
teacher
has
read
it
ever
so
many
times
at
the
end
of
it
it
says
unhappy
and
unfortunate
paw
that
is
what
he
always
says
at
the
end
of
all
his
letters
and
he
wants
me
to
go
to
the
prison
to
see
him
why
you
see
him
no
replied
emily
not
understanding
that
dotty
referred
to
her
blindness
no
i
could
see
him
the
superintendent
would
let
me
go
he
says
it
no
place
for
little
girls
i
should
think
it
was
said
dotty
looking
around
for
flyaway
who
was
riding
in
a
lady
chair
made
by
two
admiring
little
girls
there
was
one
thing
i
did
tell
said
emily
who
felt
obliged
to
pour
her
whole
history
into
her
new
friend
ears
i
was
sick
last
spring
and
had
a
fever
if
it
had
been
scarlet
fever
i
should
have
died
but
it
was
of
scarlet
fever
and
i
got
well
i
glad
you
got
well
said
dotty
rather
tired
of
emily
troubles
but
do
you
want
to
play
with
the
other
girls
i
do
yes
let
us
play
rollo
on
the
ocean
cried
octavia
who
was
bosom
friend
and
was
seldom
away
from
her
long
at
a
time
but
had
just
now
been
devoting
herself
to
katie
here
is
the
ship
all
aboard
chapter
iii
playing
ship
now
this
ship
was
an
old
and
had
never
been
in
water
deeper
than
a
mud
puddle
a
dozen
little
girls
climbed
in
with
great
bustle
and
confusion
pretending
they
were
walking
a
plank
and
climbing
up
some
steps
after
they
were
fairly
on
board
they
waved
their
handkerchiefs
for
a
good
by
to
their
friends
on
shore
then
octavia
fired
peas
out
of
a
little
popgun
twice
and
this
was
meant
as
a
long
farewell
to
the
land
now
they
were
fairly
out
on
the
ocean
and
began
to
rock
back
and
forth
as
if
tossed
by
a
heavy
sea
see
how
the
waves
rise
said
emily
and
threw
up
her
hands
with
an
undulating
motion
i
can
see
them
she
cried
an
intent
look
coming
into
her
closed
eyes
they
are
green
with
white
bubbles
like
soap
suds
and
the
sun
shines
on
them
so
o
is
as
beautiful
as
flowers
booful
as
flowers
echoed
flyaway
who
was
one
of
the
passengers
while
dotty
wondered
how
octavia
knew
the
difference
between
green
and
white
she
did
not
know
and
what
sort
of
a
picture
she
painted
in
her
mind
of
the
mysterious
sea
i
am
sure
i
can
not
tell
now
said
miriam
lake
the
prettiest
of
the
children
it
is
time
to
strike
the
bells
so
she
struck
a
with
a
stick
eight
times
that
is
eight
bells
explained
she
to
dotty
and
it
means
four
but
jennie
holiday
where
is
the
kitten
why
we
are
not
half
ready
the
children
never
thought
they
could
play
ship
without
a
kitten
a
gray
and
white
one
which
they
put
into
a
cage
just
as
jennie
holiday
did
when
she
and
rollo
travelled
by
themselves
from
new
york
to
liverpool
when
the
kitten
had
been
brought
they
had
got
as
far
as
long
island
sound
and
they
said
the
kitten
was
sent
by
a
ship
of
war
which
had
to
be
spoken
this
is
a
funny
way
to
play
said
miriam
here
we
are
at
halifax
and
nobody
has
heaved
the
log
yet
no
said
octavia
so
we
ca
tell
how
many
knots
an
hour
we
are
going
going
a
great
many
knocks
cried
katie
whose
exertions
in
rocking
from
side
to
side
had
thrown
her
overboard
once
we
never
get
to
liverpool
in
this
world
said
emily
unless
miss
percival
comes
and
steers
the
ship
it
happened
at
that
very
moment
that
miss
percival
came
into
the
yard
with
aunt
maria
if
you
will
excuse
me
clifford
said
she
laughing
i
will
take
command
of
this
ship
no
apologies
are
necessary
replied
clifford
i
should
be
very
glad
to
watch
your
proceedings
is
it
possible
miss
percival
that
you
are
capable
of
guiding
a
vessel
across
the
atlantic
i
have
often
tried
it
said
miss
percival
going
on
board
but
we
sometimes
have
a
shipwreck
emily
said
she
you
may
heave
the
log
so
emily
rose
and
taking
a
large
spool
of
which
miss
percival
gave
her
held
it
above
her
head
turning
it
slowly
till
a
tatting
shuttle
which
was
fastened
at
the
end
of
the
thread
fell
to
the
ground
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
log
and
octavia
with
one
or
two
other
girls
pretended
to
tug
with
much
force
in
order
to
draw
it
in
for
the
ship
was
going
so
fast
that
the
friction
against
the
cord
was
very
great
knots
had
been
made
in
the
cotton
over
which
emily
ran
her
quick
fingers
ten
knots
an
hour
said
she
very
good
speed
returned
the
captain
i
do
not
think
we
shall
be
able
to
take
an
observation
as
it
is
rather
cloudy
sailors
take
observations
at
noon
if
the
sun
is
out
by
means
of
a
sextant
with
which
they
measure
the
distance
from
the
sun
to
the
southern
horizon
in
this
way
the
captain
can
tell
the
exact
latitude
of
the
ship
but
miss
percival
made
believe
there
was
a
storm
coming
up
so
it
was
not
possible
to
take
an
observation
it
is
two
bells
said
she
the
wind
is
out
there
will
be
a
fearful
storm
i
would
advise
the
passengers
to
turn
into
their
berths
the
children
lay
down
upon
the
floor
there
there
said
miriam
lake
who
was
playing
jennie
holiday
my
poor
little
kitty
is
just
as
seasick
her
head
keeps
going
round
and
round
head
has
did
it
too
chimed
in
katie
rolling
herself
into
a
ball
it
keeps
yocking
yound
and
yound
i
pitch
about
so
in
my
berth
said
octavia
who
was
rollo
that
next
thing
i
shall
be
out
on
the
floor
hark
how
the
water
is
pouring
in
afraid
the
ship
has
sprung
a
leak
and
if
it
has
i
must
call
the
chambermaid
clifford
who
stood
looking
on
was
quite
amused
at
the
idea
of
calling
the
chambermaid
to
stop
a
leak
in
the
ship
man
the
pumps
said
the
captain
the
girls
tugged
away
at
a
pole
in
one
end
of
the
wagon
moving
it
up
and
down
like
a
i
do
hope
this
wind
will
go
down
sighed
emily
well
it
will
said
simple
flyaway
i
it
going
it
is
head
wind
and
a
heavy
sea
remarked
the
captain
but
never
fear
we
shall
weather
the
storm
we
are
now
on
the
southern
coast
of
ireland
i
do
think
added
she
in
a
different
tone
it
is
best
to
be
shipwrecked
children
do
you
we
will
hurry
into
liverpool
and
then
i
think
it
likely
your
little
visitors
may
enjoy
keeping
house
with
your
dolls
or
having
a
nice
swing
i
wish
i
could
eat
something
said
dotty
with
a
solemn
face
but
too
sick
so
i
groaned
flyaway
i
could
eat
noffin
cake
if
you
are
in
such
a
condition
as
that
said
the
captain
it
is
certainly
high
time
we
landed
and
here
comes
a
pilot
boat
with
a
signal
flying
we
will
take
the
pilot
on
board
added
she
drawing
in
another
little
girl
and
look
here
we
are
now
in
liverpool
we
must
go
to
the
adelphi
said
octavia
that
is
where
rollo
went
and
found
his
father
and
mother
and
thannie
but
the
kitten
did
ever
get
there
did
it
miss
percival
the
voyage
being
ended
and
with
it
the
fearful
seasickness
the
children
went
to
swinging
with
their
teacher
to
push
them
miss
percival
said
aunt
maria
shaking
hands
with
that
excellent
young
lady
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
noble
employment
it
is
a
blessed
thing
to
be
able
to
give
so
much
pleasure
to
these
dear
little
children
so
it
seems
to
me
replied
miss
percival
they
are
always
grateful
too
for
every
little
kindness
they
look
very
good
and
obedient
said
clifford
in
a
low
voice
so
they
are
sometimes
i
think
they
are
better
than
children
who
have
eyes
perhaps
because
they
can
not
see
to
get
into
so
much
mischief
added
miss
percival
pinching
emily
cheek
aunt
said
dotty
in
raptures
they
have
good
times
here
yelly
good
times
said
little
flyaway
clutching
at
her
mother
dress
mamma
i
wish
was
too
you
my
darling
baby
mother
hopes
that
will
never
be
but
if
you
can
not
be
yourself
perhaps
you
may
make
some
of
these
little
ones
happy
is
there
anything
you
would
like
to
give
away
flyaway
winked
slowly
trying
to
think
what
she
had
at
home
that
she
no
longer
wished
to
keep
yes
mamma
said
she
at
last
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
i
got
a
old
hat
o
fie
katie
i
dare
say
you
would
be
very
glad
to
part
with
that
for
i
remember
you
cried
the
other
day
when
i
asked
you
to
wear
it
your
old
hat
would
not
be
a
pretty
present
then
i
ca
fink
of
noffin
else
said
katie
shaking
her
head
at
the
same
time
having
a
guilty
recollection
of
several
beautiful
toys
and
a
hunnerd
bushels
of
canny
that
is
to
say
a
small
box
of
confectionery
her
uncle
edward
had
given
her
clifford
had
observed
of
late
that
her
little
daughter
was
not
as
generous
as
she
could
wish
both
katie
and
dotty
were
peculiarly
liable
to
become
selfish
as
they
were
much
petted
at
home
and
had
no
younger
brothers
or
sisters
with
whom
to
share
their
treasures
clifford
did
not
insist
upon
katie
making
any
sacrifice
the
little
one
did
not
pity
the
blind
children
at
all
they
seemed
so
happy
that
she
almost
envied
them
so
did
miss
dimple
it
was
not
after
all
very
grievous
to
be
blind
she
thought
if
one
could
live
at
this
institute
and
have
such
nice
plays
aunt
thinks
i
ought
to
give
them
something
i
when
i
get
home
i
mean
to
ask
mamma
and
grandma
to
dress
a
beautiful
doll
and
send
it
to
emily
she
keep
it
to
remember
me
by
and
it
wo
cost
any
of
money
if
papa
buys
the
head
good
by
emily
said
she
as
she
parted
from
her
i
hope
there
any
more
bad
things
happen
to
you
but
i
there
will
replied
emily
cheerfully
parlin
and
horace
were
waiting
in
the
hall
and
the
latter
was
impatiently
watching
the
tall
clock
they
had
been
in
the
greenhouse
looking
at
the
flowers
and
in
the
shop
where
the
blind
boys
learn
to
make
brooms
and
brushes
well
ladies
are
you
ready
to
go
asked
parlin
taking
flyaway
by
the
hand
yes
we
ladies
is
ready
replied
she
so
this
was
the
end
of
their
visit
at
the
institute
after
they
had
gone
away
the
little
blind
girls
said
to
one
another
what
nice
children
those
are
which
is
the
prettiest
alice
or
katie
for
they
always
spoke
of
people
and
things
exactly
as
if
they
could
see
them
chapter
iv
a
spoiled
dinner
next
morning
dotty
dimple
and
her
father
started
for
maine
flyaway
did
not
like
this
at
all
her
cousin
had
been
so
pleasant
and
so
entertaining
that
she
wished
to
keep
her
always
what
you
ca
stay
dotty
dimpwil
o
said
dotty
tearing
herself
away
from
the
little
clinging
arms
i
must
go
home
and
get
ready
for
christmas
no
you
musser
persisted
katie
we
got
a
santa
claw
in
chimley
you
musser
go
home
it
is
for
santa
claus
at
all
darling
it
is
for
my
papa
and
wedding
to
stand
up
so
they
can
be
married
over
again
now
kiss
me
and
let
me
go
her
goin
home
to
kismus
pie
remarked
katie
as
she
took
her
mournful
way
with
her
mamma
to
the
house
where
they
were
visiting
she
did
not
know
what
a
wedding
might
be
but
was
sure
it
had
pies
in
it
there
goes
a
right
smart
little
girl
said
horace
with
a
sweep
of
his
thumb
towards
the
cleveland
cars
if
it
was
for
prudy
i
should
like
her
better
than
any
other
cousin
i
have
in
the
world
she
is
an
engaging
child
replied
his
mother
and
really
seems
to
be
outgrowing
her
naughty
ways
thus
you
see
dotty
dimple
in
coming
away
from
indiana
had
left
in
the
minds
of
her
friends
only
golden
opinions
perhaps
she
was
rather
overrated
everything
had
gone
well
with
her
during
her
visit
why
should
she
not
be
pleasant
and
happy
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
was
the
same
old
naughtiness
in
her
heart
only
just
now
it
was
asleep
we
shall
see
nothing
remarkable
occurred
on
the
homeward
journey
except
that
parlin
bought
some
in
boston
and
carried
them
home
as
a
present
to
read
they
travelled
one
night
in
a
and
by
that
means
reached
portland
a
day
earlier
than
they
were
expected
dotty
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
for
this
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
of
the
question
she
had
anticipated
the
pleasure
of
being
met
at
the
depot
by
susy
and
prudy
and
now
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
but
it
would
be
delightful
to
give
the
family
a
surprise
on
the
whole
she
was
very
well
satisfied
as
they
drove
up
to
the
new
home
however
what
was
their
astonishment
to
find
it
closed
there
was
not
even
a
window
open
or
any
other
sign
that
the
house
was
inhabited
dotty
ran
to
every
door
and
shook
it
why
papa
papa
do
you
there
anybody
dead
the
probability
is
alice
that
they
have
gone
away
i
will
run
over
to
prosser
and
see
if
she
knows
anything
about
it
prosser
was
the
nearest
neighbor
on
the
left
her
little
daughter
came
to
the
door
in
tears
having
hurt
herself
against
a
trunk
in
the
hall
miss
carrie
said
parlin
can
you
tell
me
where
parlin
and
the
rest
of
the
family
are
gone
yes
caddy
prosser
the
house
is
shut
up
added
dotty
and
i
afraid
they
dead
i
do
know
where
they
gone
nor
anything
sobbed
carrie
i
did
know
the
trunk
was
in
the
entry
and
i
came
so
fast
i
fell
right
over
it
i
am
very
sorry
you
are
hurt
said
parlin
is
your
mother
at
home
no
sir
she
is
her
trunk
came
but
she
did
there
was
no
information
to
be
obtained
at
the
prossers
so
parlin
went
to
lawrence
the
nearest
neighbor
on
the
right
making
the
same
inquiries
but
all
he
learned
was
that
a
carriage
had
been
seen
standing
at
parlin
door
who
had
gone
away
in
it
nobody
could
tell
dotty
paced
the
pavement
with
restless
steps
her
mind
agitated
by
a
thousand
wild
fancies
grandma
read
never
went
anywhere
perhaps
she
was
locked
up
in
the
house
and
zip
too
norah
was
at
cape
elizabeth
she
had
walked
out
to
see
her
friend
bridget
the
girl
with
red
hair
and
just
as
likely
as
not
she
did
ever
mean
to
come
back
again
mother
and
susy
and
prudy
had
gone
to
willowbrook
to
grandpa
parlin
of
course
they
had
and
left
grandma
bead
all
alone
in
the
house
with
nothing
to
eat
how
strange
how
unkind
grandma
she
called
out
under
read
window
there
was
no
answer
dotty
fancied
the
white
curtain
moved
just
a
little
but
that
was
because
a
fly
was
balancing
himself
on
its
folds
grandma
was
not
there
or
if
she
was
she
must
be
very
sound
asleep
o
dear
dear
and
here
were
dotty
and
her
father
come
home
a
day
earlier
than
they
were
expected
and
instead
of
giving
the
family
a
joyful
surprise
they
had
a
surprise
themselves
only
not
a
joyful
one
by
any
means
how
impolite
it
was
in
everybody
how
unkind
to
go
away
at
first
dotty
had
been
alarmed
but
now
her
indignation
got
the
better
of
her
fears
when
she
see
prudy
again
the
sister
who
pretended
to
love
her
so
much
she
would
take
the
presents
out
of
her
trunk
for
ever
so
long
just
to
tease
the
naughty
girl
meanwhile
her
father
did
not
appear
to
be
at
all
disturbed
perhaps
they
have
gone
to
the
islands
or
somewhere
else
not
far
away
to
spend
the
day
it
is
now
nearly
two
you
may
go
to
the
preble
house
with
me
and
dinner
and
then
i
will
unlock
the
house
and
find
some
one
to
stay
with
you
till
night
would
you
like
that
or
would
you
prefer
to
go
at
once
to
your
aunt
eastman
you
may
have
your
choice
dotty
reflected
about
half
a
minute
i
will
go
to
aunt
eastman
if
you
please
papa
this
appeared
to
her
decidedly
the
most
dignified
course
she
would
go
to
aunt
eastman
and
she
would
not
be
in
the
least
haste
about
coming
back
again
she
would
teach
her
sisters
especially
prudy
that
it
is
best
to
be
hospitable
towards
one
friends
when
they
have
been
away
on
a
long
journey
her
anger
may
seem
very
absurd
but
you
must
remember
little
friends
that
dotty
dimple
had
now
become
a
travelled
young
lady
she
had
seen
the
world
and
her
had
grown
every
day
she
had
been
away
her
heart
was
all
aglow
with
love
towards
the
dear
ones
at
home
and
it
was
very
chilling
to
find
the
door
locked
in
her
face
she
did
not
stop
to
reflect
that
no
unkindness
had
been
intended
as
they
drove
to
aunt
eastman
her
father
observed
that
her
bright
little
face
was
very
downcast
but
supposed
her
sadness
arose
from
the
disappointment
there
are
depths
of
foolishness
in
children
hearts
which
even
their
parents
can
not
fathom
strange
to
say
neither
parlin
nor
dotty
had
thought
that
the
family
might
be
visiting
at
eastman
but
such
was
the
case
it
was
johnny
birthday
and
his
father
had
sent
the
carriage
into
the
city
that
morning
for
parlin
grandma
read
and
the
children
as
for
norah
dotty
was
right
with
regard
to
her
she
walked
out
to
the
cape
to
see
the
bridget
i
glad
johnny
was
born
instead
of
said
prudy
for
we
would
go
out
of
the
house
for
anything
auntie
i
can
seem
to
see
cousin
dimple
said
percy
she
carry
her
head
higher
than
ever
prudy
cast
upon
the
youth
as
strong
a
look
of
disapproval
as
her
gentle
face
could
express
percy
you
must
talk
so
about
dotty
she
is
my
sister
she
is
so
very
proud
but
if
i
was
as
handsome
as
she
is
i
should
be
proud
too
o
no
she
is
very
meek
dimple
is
just
like
a
little
lamb
do
you
remember
that
verse
she
used
to
repeat
chillens
you
should
never
let
your
naughty
rise
your
little
hands
were
never
made
to
tear
each
uzzer
eyes
out
if
she
cross
it
because
you
and
johnny
tease
her
so
said
prudy
i
think
it
a
shame
percy
only
laughed
he
and
prudy
were
sitting
in
the
doorway
arranging
bouquets
for
the
susy
joined
them
bearing
in
her
hands
some
dahlias
and
tuberoses
why
prudy
said
she
what
makes
your
face
all
aflame
she
has
been
fighting
for
your
little
dove
of
a
sister
replied
percy
the
one
that
went
west
to
finish
her
education
this
speech
only
deepened
the
color
in
prudy
face
though
she
tried
hard
to
subdue
her
anger
and
closed
her
lips
with
the
firm
resolve
not
to
open
them
again
till
she
could
speak
pleasantly
look
exclaimed
percy
there
a
carriage
turning
the
corner
why
it
dimple
herself
and
uncle
edward
it
ca
be
it
is
both
little
girls
ran
to
the
gate
o
father
o
dotty
why
when
did
you
get
home
by
this
time
parlin
had
come
out
also
eastman
and
johnny
everybody
was
as
surprised
and
delighted
as
possible
and
even
miss
dimple
sitting
in
state
in
the
coach
was
perfectly
satisfied
and
condescended
to
alight
instead
of
riding
through
the
carriage
gateway
o
dotty
dimple
i
so
glad
to
see
you
cried
prudy
it
is
my
sister
alice
and
she
is
grown
so
dear
so
dear
that
i
would
be
the
jewel
that
trembles
at
her
ear
only
you
do
wear
you
know
are
you
glad
to
see
me
though
prudy
then
what
made
you
go
off
and
shut
the
house
up
o
we
did
expect
you
till
and
it
johnny
birthday
dinner
is
almost
ready
are
you
glad
such
a
dinner
too
any
bill
of
fare
asked
dotty
with
a
sudden
recollection
of
past
grandeur
a
bill
of
fare
o
no
those
are
for
hotels
but
there
almost
everything
else
now
you
can
go
up
stairs
with
me
and
wash
your
face
dotty
appeared
at
table
with
smooth
hair
and
a
fresh
ruffle
which
prudy
had
basted
in
the
neck
of
her
dress
she
looked
very
neat
and
prim
and
as
percy
had
predicted
carried
her
head
higher
than
ever
i
suppose
said
aunt
eastman
you
will
have
a
great
many
wonderful
things
to
tell
us
dotty
for
i
am
sure
you
travelled
with
your
eyes
open
yes
i
hardly
ever
went
to
sleep
in
the
cars
but
when
you
said
auntie
it
made
me
think
of
the
blind
children
we
went
to
the
to
see
them
how
do
they
look
asked
johnny
they
do
at
all
they
are
blind
astonishing
i
open
my
eyes
if
i
were
they
why
percy
they
are
blind
how
is
that
how
blind
is
a
stone
dotty
busied
herself
with
her
turkey
her
eastman
cousins
all
had
a
way
of
rendering
her
very
uncomfortable
they
made
remarks
which
were
intended
to
be
witty
but
were
only
pert
they
were
not
really
or
they
would
have
been
more
thoughtful
of
the
feelings
of
others
alice
said
dear
read
trying
to
turn
the
conversation
i
see
thee
wears
a
very
pretty
ring
dotty
took
it
off
her
finger
and
passed
it
around
for
inspection
i
never
had
a
ring
before
said
she
with
animation
i
never
had
anything
to
wear
percy
laughed
i
found
the
pearl
in
an
oyster
stew
grandma
it
is
such
a
very
funny
place
out
west
yes
it
is
really
a
pearl
said
percy
only
spoiled
by
boiling
look
her
toddlekins
oysters
do
grow
out
west
they
grow
here
on
the
coast
you
better
study
astronomy
dotty
took
refuge
in
silence
again
like
an
oyster
withdrawing
into
his
shell
o
dotty
said
susy
presently
tell
me
what
you
saw
out
west
i
want
to
hear
all
about
it
well
i
saw
a
pandrammer
replied
dotty
briefly
what
in
the
world
is
that
said
johnny
it
is
a
long
picture
and
they
keep
pulling
it
out
like
india
rubber
she
means
a
cried
johnny
why
i
went
to
one
last
night
we
can
see
as
much
as
you
can
without
going
out
west
either
here
was
another
sensation
dotty
might
as
well
have
been
eating
ashes
as
the
delirious
dinner
before
her
do
you
like
your
pudding
dear
asked
aunt
eastman
o
yes
i
always
like
replied
the
unfortunate
dotty
stumbling
over
the
word
in
spite
of
their
mother
warning
frown
the
three
young
eastmans
laughed
while
susy
and
prudy
who
had
kinder
hearts
and
better
manners
drew
down
their
mouths
with
the
greatest
solemnity
i
ai
going
to
speak
another
word
cried
the
persecuted
little
traveller
setting
down
her
goblet
and
hitting
it
against
her
plate
till
it
rang
again
called
out
florence
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
no
such
word
as
this
was
too
much
dotty
had
smarted
under
these
cruel
blows
long
enough
she
hastily
arose
from
the
table
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
florence
and
percy
you
are
both
very
thoughtless
said
eastman
reprovingly
parlin
looked
deeply
pained
as
she
always
did
when
her
little
daughter
gave
way
to
her
temper
but
she
made
no
allusion
to
the
subject
and
tried
to
go
on
with
her
dinner
as
if
nothing
had
happened
dotty
ran
into
the
front
yard
threw
herself
on
the
ground
and
buried
her
face
in
a
verbena
bed
there
it
was
of
any
use
she
could
be
good
it
would
last
when
she
had
just
come
home
and
had
so
many
things
to
tell
and
supposed
everybody
would
be
glad
to
see
her
and
hear
her
talk
why
percy
and
florence
must
just
spoil
it
all
by
laughing
o
it
was
too
bad
i
wish
i
had
come
i
wish
i
been
switched
off
sighed
dotty
meaning
if
she
meant
anything
that
she
wished
the
cars
had
whirled
her
away
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
instead
of
bringing
her
home
where
people
were
all
ready
with
one
accord
to
trample
her
into
the
dust
here
i
been
off
and
know
how
to
travel
and
keep
my
ticket
in
my
glove
six
years
old
going
on
seven
been
down
in
a
coal
mine
prudy
never
dare
to
had
a
jigger
cut
out
of
my
side
been
to
the
one
of
the
conductors
said
a
fine
little
daughter
of
yours
sir
i
heard
him
aunt
washed
all
those
out
of
my
dress
and
i
had
on
a
clean
ruffle
and
then
just
i
could
say
there
there
do
feel
so
bad
you
precious
sister
said
a
soothing
voice
and
a
soft
cheek
was
pressed
to
dotty
and
a
pair
of
loving
arms
clasped
her
close
percy
was
real
and
so
was
flossy
so
there
o
prudy
i
wish
they
were
every
one
of
in
the
penitential
locked
in
and
johnny
too
me
just
got
home
and
never
did
a
single
thing
to
them
and
there
they
laughed
right
in
my
face
but

harm

with
come
let
hurry
up
stairs
the
back
way
little
sister
for
they
be
out
from
dinner
and
see
us
dotty
needed
no
second
hint
in
half
an
hour
she
was
so
far
recovered
from
the
as
to
be
hungry
when
prudy
secretly
begged
some
pudding
for
her
of
the
willing
angeline
then
the
same
little
peacemaker
went
to
her
cousins
and
made
them
each
and
all
promise
to
be
more
careful
of
her
sister
feelings
after
which
there
was
in
the
and
a
loud
call
for
miss
dimple
who
consented
to
go
down
after
much
urging
and
was
the
merriest
one
of
the
whole
party
chapter
playing
truant
for
several
days
after
her
return
dotty
dimple
was
in
a
state
of
jubilee
she
had
a
great
deal
to
tell
and
the
whole
household
was
ready
to
listen
norah
would
stand
with
a
dish
or
a
in
her
hand
and
almost
forget
what
she
had
intended
to
do
in
her
desire
to
hear
every
word
miss
dotty
was
saying
once
when
she
related
her
adventure
with
the
grandma
read
who
was
her
caps
let
the
starch
boil
over
on
the
stove
and
at
another
time
parlin
was
so
much
absorbed
in
a
description
of
phebe
that
she
almost
spiced
a
custard
with
cayenne
pepper
all
these
evidences
of
interest
were
very
flattering
to
dotty
sometimes
she
took
prudy
one
side
and
told
her
the
same
story
twice
over
to
which
prudy
always
listened
with
unfailing
politeness
as
i
said
before
while
this
excitement
lasted
miss
dimple
was
in
a
state
of
jubilee
but
by
and
by
the
novelty
wore
off
she
had
told
the
family
everything
she
could
possibly
think
of
and
now
longed
for
a
few
pairs
of
fresh
ears
into
which
to
pour
her
stories
everybody
else
was
working
for
christmas
dotty
alone
was
idle
for
no
one
had
time
to
give
her
a
daily
stint
and
see
that
she
accomplished
it
after
the
holidays
i
shall
have
to
go
to
school
so
now
is
my
time
to
play
said
she
to
herself
and
i
ought
to
play
every
minute
as
tight
as
i
can
spring
but
she
tried
so
hard
to
be
happy
that
the
effort
was
really
very
tiresome
if
she
had
only
had
something
to
do
i
am
almost
sure
she
would
not
have
fallen
into
the
misfortune
which
i
am
about
to
record
one
day
her
mother
sent
her
to
a
worsted
store
to
pattern
some
worsteds
a
girl
behind
the
counter
gave
her
the
right
shades
and
she
slowly
started
for
home
it
was
about
four
of
a
november
day
dotty
glancing
idly
at
the
sky
saw
that
the
sun
was
already
getting
low
how
queer
it
is
thought
she
it
seems
as
if
the
sun
grows
sleepy
very
early
nowadays
and
goes
to
bed
right
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
well
i
declare
if
there
is
lina
rosenberg
the
beautiful
little
jewess
was
just
turning
an
opposite
corner
and
as
usual
the
sight
of
her
face
bewitched
dotty
in
a
minute
illustration
lina
rosenberg
invites
dotty
to
her
house
o
lina
rosenberg
come
over
here
how
do
you
do
i
very
well
dotty
how
do
you
do
only
i
wish
you
would
call
me
a
bug
well
then
lina
you
must
have
bugs

your
name
if
you
do
want
to
be
called
by

west

dotty
dimple
yes

have
you
may
ask
my
father
i
kept
my
own
ticket
right
in
my
glove
and
took
the
whole
care
of
myself
went
to
the
blind
found
a
pearl
in
an
oyster
been
down
in
a
coal
mine
and
and
come
to
my
house
wo
you
and
tell
me
all
about
it
said
lina
rosenberg
looking
as
beguiling
as
possible
and
taking
unresisting
hand
dotty
knew
very
well
that
her
mother
would
never
allow
her
to
go
to
lina
house
but
she
did
not
like
to
say
that
and
she
only
replied
i
matched
my
worsteds
and
now
i
must
go
home
o
you
can
go
home
afterwards
my
mother
said
to
me
you
bring
dotty
dimple
home
to
supper
this
very
night
she
be
so
glad
to
see
you
dotty
gave
another
glance
at
the
sky
then
one
at
the
city
clock
what
time
do
you
drink
tea
lina
at
five
always
dotty
had
long
felt
a
great
curiosity
about
the
domestic
affairs
of
the
jews
and
here
was
an
unexpected
opportunity
to
sit
down
at
the
very
table
with
them
she
had
an
invitation
from
the
head
of
the
family
and
that
was
something
which
did
not
happen
every
day
she
could
go
home
any
time
afterwards
for
their
own
was
not
till
half
past
six
i
walk
along
with
you
a
little
way
lina
and
think
it
over
it
was
true
parlin
did
not
approve
of
mandoline
or
any
of
her
family
but
dotty
thought
she
would
forget
that
just
for
once
o
dear
i
keep
thinking
how
my
mamma
said
do
not
wish
you
to
play
with
lina
rosenberg
now
i
can
always
forget
easy
enough
but
when
i
try
to
forget
it
says
itself
over
and
over
and
i
remember
just
as
hard
as
they
turned
another
corner
they
met
susy
who
had
been
sent
to
the
why
dotty
said
she
what
are
you
doing
on
that
street
lina
spoke
up
very
boldly
she
going
to
the
doctor
with
me
susy
parlin
to
get
a
plaster
for
my
mother
at
this
wicked
speech
dotty
heart
almost
sank
into
her
boots
for
she
had
never
known
before
that
lina
would
tell
a
deliberate
lie
lina
lived
in
a
little
grocery
store
her
father
was
gone
away
and
her
mother
had
just
served
a
customer
with
a
pound
of
damp
brown
sugar
saying
as
she
clipped
the
string
it
very
cheap
sweetening
at
that
price
we
are
going
to
rise
on
it
after
that
she
stood
a
minute
in
front
of
the
store
and
shook
her
head
at
jacob
a
little
boy
some
three
years
old
who
was
trying
to
balance
a
patent
washboard
against
a
tree
which
grew
out
of
the
brick
pavement
it
was
a
large
scrawny
tree
which
looked
as
if
it
was
obliged
to
live
there
but
did
want
to
and
had
tried
in
vain
to
get
burnt
up
in
the
portland
fire
from
the
lower
branches
of
the
tree
depended
a
couple
of
hams
and
a
painted
board
with
the
words
good
family
butter
come
in
jacob
you
naughty
boy
said
rosenberg
this
time
shaking
him
because
she
was
afraid
he
would
injure
the
patent
then
jacob
who
had
been
waiting
for
the
shaking
and
would
not
stir
without
it
went
in
at
the
side
door
crying
for
the
family
lived
in
one
end
of
the
store
rosenberg
had
a
great
many
children
and
was
obliged
to
work
very
hard
at
various
employments
just
now
she
went
to
spreading
to
dry
under
the
stove
she
was
not
expecting
company
and
when
mandoline
entered
with
dotty
she
looked
up
from
her
work
with
a
frown
who
you
brought
home
with
you
this
time
mandoline
rosenberg
said
she
take
off
your
hat
and
hang
it
over
them
tommatuses
but
mind
yer
do
drop
it
into
that
dish
of
lard
mother
pleaded
mandoline
we
want
to
go
up
chamber
to
see
my
pretty
things
her
mother
sent
her
no
she
did
no
such
a
thing
you
a
master
hand
to
pick
up
children
and
fetch
home
here
and
then
crawl
out
of
it
by
lying
besides
you
got
to
knit
i
must
have
those
socks
done
by
noon
mandy
or
i
know
the
reason
why
as
rosenberg
spoke
she
pushed
a
waiter
full
of
seeds
under
the
stove
as
if
she
hated
the
very
sight
of
them
and
when
she
stood
up
again
dotty
observed
that
her
dirty
calico
dress
did
not
come
anywhere
near
the
tops
of
her
shoes
but
mother
said
mandoline
with
a
winning
smile
this
is
dotty
dimple
the
little
girl
that
gave
me
the
this
was
partly
true
dotty
had
given
mandoline
an
old
but
it
had
been
in
return
for
some
maple
sugar
which
the
little
jewess
had
pilfered
from
her
father
store
dotty
dimple
is
it
said
rosenberg
with
a
sharp
look
at
the
little
guest
i
do
know
now
any
better
than
i
did
before
that
a
name
for
a
i
should
say
alice
parlin
mother
is
it
o
well
you
may
take
her
up
stairs
out
of
my
way
but
mind
you
must
knit
every
minute
you
gone
dotty
was
greatly
abashed
by
this
reception
and
would
have
rushed
out
of
the
house
but
mandoline
held
her
fast
you
sha
go
a
step
said
she
i
hide
your
hat
so
dotty
under
peril
of
going
home
bareheaded
was
obliged
to
creep
up
the
rickety
staircase
with
mandoline
she
likened
her
feelings
on
the
occasion
to
those
of
a
person
whom
the
mayor
is
putting
in
the
lockup
indeed
the
was
dotty
dream
of
all
the
horrors
and
she
had
no
doubt
it
was
the
mayor
himself
who
always
stood
with
his
hands
outstretched
ready
to
thrust
wicked
people
into
it
the
chamber
which
the
little
girls
entered
was
an
unfinished
one
and
from
the
rafters
hung
paper
bags
of
dried
herbs
for
besides
being
a
housekeeper
and
clerk
rosenberg
was
something
of
a
doctress
withal
and
made
bitters
for
her
particular
friends
sit
down
here
on
the
bed
dotty
dimple
and
look
at
my
paper
dolls
said
lina
producing
from
under
a
disjointed
chair
an
old
cigar
box
full
of
paper
heroes
and
heroines
mandoline
was
an
artist
in
he
way
and
these
figures
were
clad
in
the
most
brilliant
costumes
of
silver
and
gold
dotty
was
dazzled
never
before
had
it
been
her
lot
to
see
such
magnificent
dolls
dolls
which
shone
so
in
the
sun
every
one
of
them
a
king
or
a
queen
and
fit
to
wear
a
crown
o
lina
sighed
she
in
ecstasy
where
you
get
your
silver
and
gold
tease
for
it
replied
the
little
jewess
dotty
knew
to
her
own
sorrow
that
lina
was
capable
of
teasing
it
was
hard
to
keep
so
much
as
an
apple
or
a
peppermint
away
from
her
if
she
happened
to
set
her
heart
on
it
i
give
you
twenty
dolls
said
lina
if
you
let
me
have
your
ring
and
it
is
a
very
pretty
ring
either
looks
like
brass
dotty
locked
her
fingers
together
you
ca
tease
away
my
owny
dony
pearl
lina
if
it
brass
so
you
need
try
mandoline
called
out
rosenberg
sharp
voice
from
down
stairs
are
you
at
work
o
dear
said
lina
sauntering
along
to
an
old
chest
and
taking
her
knitting
from
the
top
of
it
that
always
the
way
i
thought
if
you
came
mother
let
me
play
dotty
understood
from
this
remark
why
lina
had
asked
her
to
go
home
with
her
it
was
not
because
she
wished
to
hear
any
of
dotty
brilliant
stories
for
she
had
not
asked
a
single
question
about
out
west
it
was
because
she
hoped
for
a
reprieve
from
the
dreaded
knitting
she
a
real
naughty
little
girl
thought
miss
dimple
and
if
she
had
hided
my
hat
i
go
right
home
there
was
a
heavy
tread
on
the
stairs
rosenberg
was
coming
up
partly
to
see
if
her
daughter
was
knitting
and
partly
to
hang
a
paper
bag
on
the
long
pole
overhead
mandoline
was
dreadfully
afraid
of
her
mother
and
in
her
eagerness
to
be
found
hard
at
work
she
rattled
her
needles
very
fast
while
her
fingers
wandered
aimlessly
about
among
the
stitches
rosenberg
detected
the
cheat
at
once
and
as
she
was
needing
the
money
for
the
socks
she
scolded
mandoline
soundly
and
pelted
her
pretty
little
hands
rat
tat
tat
with
a
steel
thimble
dotty
was
a
little
startled
and
peeped
out
at
lina
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
rosenberg
scolded
so
hard
that
the
paper
bags
overhead
seemed
to
rattle
and
some
yellow
pollen
dropped
out
of
one
of
them
like
shooting
stars
dotty
had
never
known
that
there
are
such
cruel
people
in
the
world
but
let
me
tell
you
little
reader
every
mother
is
not
like
the
gentle
woman
who
takes
you
in
her
lap
and
kindly
reproves
you
when
you
have
done
wrong
no
there
are
very
different
mothers
ignorant
ones
who
do
not
know
how
to
treat
their
children
any
more
than
you
know
how
to
build
a
brick
house
rosenberg
was
so
severe
and
unreasonable
that
her
little
daughter
through
fear
of
her
had
learned
to
deceive
still
rosenberg
loved
mandoline
and
would
have
been
a
better
mother
perhaps
if
she
had
only
known
how
and
had
not
had
so
much
work
to
do
presently
she
went
down
stairs
and
left
the
little
girls
together
good
said
lina
in
a
low
voice
she
gone
now
we
play
but
you
ca
knit
if
you
play
lina
tell
me
where
you
hided
my
hat
i
want
to
go
home
you
sha
go
home
till
after
supper
you
little
darling
dotty
dimple
o
but
i
must
go
for
my
mother
does
know
where
i
am
said
dotty
in
a
dreary
tone
she
had
no
longer
any
curiosity
regarding
jewish
suppers
all
she
wanted
was
the
liberty
to
get
away
but
it
is
always
easier
to
fall
into
a
trap
than
to
get
out
of
it
mandoline
would
not
produce
the
missing
hat
and
it
was
no
light
matter
for
dotty
to
go
down
stairs
among
the
noisy
quarrelsome
children
and
beg
the
severe
rosenberg
to
take
her
part
if
she
did
so
perhaps
the
woman
would
pelt
her
with
the
steel
thimble
perhaps
too
she
would
say
mandoline
might
keep
the
hat
so
dotty
played
synagogue
and
all
the
while
the
sun
was
dropping
down
down
the
sky
as
if
it
had
a
leaden
weight
attached
to
it
to
make
it
go
faster
chapter
vi
a
strange
visit
the
same
warfare
of
words
continued
to
come
up
from
the
kitchen
and
presently
the
odor
of
sausages
stole
up
too
rosenberg
was
preparing
supper
it
seemed
to
the
impatient
dotty
that
she
was
a
long
while
about
it
but
she
worked
as
fast
as
she
could
with
so
many
children
clinging
to
her
skirts
and
impeding
her
movements
supper
mandoline
called
she
at
last
in
a
shrill
voice
and
the
little
girls
went
down
the
supper
was
palatable
enough
but
very
unwholesome
and
the
was
dirty
and
wrinkled
you
do
seem
to
like
my
cooking
said
rosenberg
with
a
displeased
glance
at
dotty
full
plate
yes
replied
the
little
guest
faintly
but
i
eaten
up
my
appetite
at
the
same
time
she
swallowed
a
little
oily
gravy
in
desperation
and
looked
slyly
to
see
if
solly
was
watching
her
yes
he
was
and
so
were
all
the
rest
of
the
family
as
if
she
had
been
a
peculiar
kind
of
animal
just
caught
and
caged
i
suppose
they
are
dreadful
nice
folks
at
your
house
continued
rosenberg
i
almost
wonder
your
mother
let
you
come
here
to
play
with
my
poor
little
girl
mandy
just
as
good
as
you
are
though
you
can
tell
her
so
and
she
got
a
sight
prettier
eyes
dotty
heart
kept
swelling
and
swelling
till
presently
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
room
enough
in
her
whole
body
to
hold
it
she
thought
of
the
cheerful
orderly
at
home
she
recalled
her
mother
gentle
ways
her
lovely
face
and
longed
to
kiss
her
cheek
and
whisper
forgive
me
mamma
be
just
as
patient
with
me
thought
dotty
she
always
is
but
if
i
once
get
home
i
never
make
her
patient
any
more
i
never
run
away
again
not
unless
she
me
to
i
wo
the
children
as
fast
as
they
finished
their
suppers
jumped
up
and
ran
away
from
the
table
all
but
solly
who
had
some
faint
idea
that
it
was
not
polite
to
do
so
before
company
he
was
a
natural
gentleman
and
it
was
unfortunate
that
just
at
this
time
his
mother
was
obliged
to
send
him
to
munjoy
of
an
errand
otherwise
he
would
have
made
his
sister
give
up
dotty
hat
and
perhaps
would
have
walked
home
with
the
unhappy
child
himself
as
it
was
dotty
did
not
seem
to
have
a
friend
in
the
world
it
was
now
so
dark
that
she
hardly
dared
look
out
of
doors
but
even
in
the
brightest
daylight
she
could
not
have
found
her
way
home
you
got
to
stay
all
night
said
mandoline
is
that
splendid
mandoline
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
she
had
observed
that
her
mother
urged
her
own
guests
to
stay
and
sometimes
kept
them
almost
by
force
this
she
supposed
was
true
politeness
more
than
that
she
was
anxious
for
private
reasons
to
hold
dotty
so
she
might
not
have
to
knit
so
much
she
knew
too
that
her
mother
was
proud
to
have
such
a
little
girl
in
the
house
so
she
would
not
give
up
dotty
hat
at
eight
dotty
went
to
bed
with
mandoline
in
the
unfinished
chamber
sorely
against
her
will
and
mandoline
told
her
such
dreadful
stories
that
she
could
not
close
her
eyes
for
fright
this
is
the
queerest
house
i
was
ever
in
thought
she
and
the
queerest
bed
i
it
made
of
for
they
stick
into
me
awfully
the
bed
was
on
the
floor
and
was
founded
upon
woolsacks
and
buffalo
skins
the
sleeping
arrangements
in
this
house
were
somewhat
peculiar
rosenberg
was
like
the
old
woman
in
the
shoe
and
she
stowed
her
numerous
family
away
for
the
night
in
as
little
space
as
possible
for
instance
the
four
youngest
children
slept
together
in
one
two
at
the
top
and
two
at
the
bottom
their
feet
coming
together
in
the
middle
but
mandoline
had
left
the
trundle
bed
and
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
her
guest
the
companion
the
little
kosina
was
quite
indignant
at
being
deserted
and
made
a
loud
outcry
in
the
hope
of
attracting
her
mother
attention
i
do
want
to
sleep
alone
said
she
i
do
want
to
sleep
at
another
time
dotty
would
have
laughed
heartily
it
was
so
absurd
for
a
child
to
be
lonesome
when
there
were
three
in
the
bed
but
dotty
was
too
even
to
smile
rosenberg
came
up
and
boxed
ears
and
after
that
the
subsided
at
last
when
dotty
supposed
it
must
be
midnight
though
it
was
only
nine
there
came
a
loud
knocking
at
the
side
door
she
hid
her
face
under
the
coverlet
feeling
sure
it
was
either
a
wild
indian
or
a
highway
robber
do
be
afraid
said
mandoline
rousing
herself
it
is
somebody
after
beer
and
mother
has
locked
up
the
store
no
it
was
parlin
voice
which
spoke
dotty
swollen
heart
gave
a
great
bound
and
then
sank
heavier
than
ever
my
little
daughter
alice
has
run
away
that
was
what
he
said
is
she
in
your
house
mrs
rosenberg
yes
replied
rosenberg
i
expect
its
likely
she
is
but
she
and
my
mandoline
been
abed
and
asleep
two
hours
o
papa
i
wide
awake
cried
little
dotty
with
an
eager
shriek
which
pierced
the
rafters
good
night
then
said
parlin
coldly
o
but
papa
i
want
to
go
home
what
did
my
mamma
say
about
me
she
said
she
had
sent
you
of
an
errand
when
you
have
finished
your
errand
you
may
come
home
good
night
o
not
good
night
screamed
dotty
almost
falling
down
stairs
in
her
haste
and
fastening
her
dress
as
she
ran
it
was
lina
hid
my
hat
and
that
was
why
by
the
way
said
parlin
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
his
little
daughter
who
was
clinging
to
his
knees
and
pleading
with
her
whole
soul
rosenberg
i
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
keep
this
little
runaway
girl
till
i
send
for
her
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
o
certainly
parlin
certainly
sir
replied
the
jewess
smiling
very
sweetly
and
trying
to
pat
dotty
head
which
was
in
such
violent
motion
that
she
only
succeeded
in
touching
the
end
of
her
nose
no
one
who
had
looked
at
rosenberg
at
that
moment
would
have
suspected
her
of
being
a
vixen
she
was
sure
parlin
would
pay
her
handsomely
if
she
kept
his
daughter
there
for
a
day
or
two
and
the
prospect
of
a
little
money
always
made
the
poor
woman
very
amiable
thank
you
madam
said
parlin
gently
disengaging
himself
from
dotty
when
you
are
tired
of
my
little
daughter
will
you
please
let
me
know
goodnight
rosenberg
alice
and
before
dotty
had
time
to
scream
again
he
was
gone
for
a
moment
she
stood
quite
still
gazing
at
the
then
rushed
out
into
the
darkness
calling
papa
papa
but
rosenberg
laid
her
strong
hands
upon
her
and
brought
her
back
so
your
mother
did
say
you
might
come
i
thought
it
was
queer
hush
hush
do
go
into
fits
child
there
are
no
bears
in
this
house
and
nothing
will
hurt
you
rosenberg
manner
was
much
kinder
than
it
had
been
before
and
with
a
child
quick
insight
dotty
perceived
that
her
father
coming
had
wrought
the
change
i
want
to
go
home
i
want
to
go
home
cried
she
with
another
passionate
outburst
o
take
me
do
they
wo
send
for
me
never
take
me
and
i
give
you
o
rosenberg
i
give
you
for
a
little
while
there
was
quite
a
scene
at
the
little
grocery
and
it
repented
mandoline
that
she
had
ever
hidden
dotty
hat
the
waked
up
at
both
ends
and
screamed
the
black
and
tan
dog
who
slept
under
the
counter
in
the
store
barked
lustily
the
parrot
in
the
blue
cage
called
out
quit
that
quit
that
and
rosenberg
was
afraid
a
policeman
would
come
in
to
inquire
the
cause
of
the
uproar
she
pattered
about
in
a
pair
of
her
husband
slippers
and
tucked
all
her
little
ones
into
bed
again
very
much
as
if
they
had
been
clothes
in
a
boiler
which
she
was
forcing
down
with
a
stick
she
was
a
woman
who
would
be
obeyed
and
dotty
finding
it
of
no
use
to
hold
out
against
fate
went
up
stairs
at
last
and
lay
down
beside
mandoline
on
the
this
stolen
visit
had
turned
out
quite
quite
different
from
her
anticipations
instead
of
a
delightful
supper
of
some
mysterious
jewish
cookery
she
had
been
drinking
gall
and
wormwood
that
lina
would
not
let
her
go
that
was
the
gall
that
her
father
made
her
stay
this
was
the
wormwood
she
is
a
tough
piece
sighed
rosenberg
as
she
laid
her
weary
limbs
to
repose
i
did
know
one
while
but
she
get
away
in
spite
of
me
i
wonder
what
her
father
pay
me
he
seems
to
think
this
is
a
house
of
correction
her
mother
wo
be
likely
to
let
her
stay
more
than
one
day
i
have
on
the
best
for
breakfast
and
along
in
the
forenoon
i
fetch
out
some
macaroni
cakes
and
lager
beer
coax
her
up
i
guess
just
then
rosenberg
down
stairs
and
dotty
dimple
up
stairs
both
fell
asleep
one
dreamed
of
running
away
and
being
chased
by
a
dog
with
a
hat
on
his
head
who
barked
as
fiercely
as
a
bite
the
other
dreamed
of
money
and
brown
sugar
and
all
the
while
the
rats
were
treating
themselves
to
nibbles
of
wood
but
nobody
heard
them
be
careful
old
rats
your
teeth
have
done
mischief
before
now
the
night
wore
on
to
the
wee
small
hours
when
a
loud
noise
like
a
cannon
startled
rosenberg
or
was
she
dreaming
the
house
was
shaken
to
its
very
foundation
as
if
by
an
earthquake
and
the
room
was
full
of
smoke
she
was
just
running
for
the
children
when
the
building
fell
together
with
a
crash
the
roof
was
blown
off
into
the
street
the
windows
were
shivered
to
atoms
and
tongues
of
flame
leaped
madly
up
from
the
ruins
what
did
it
mean
she
was
so
stunned
by
the
shock
that
she
scarcely
cared
whether
one
of
her
children
was
spared
or
not
she
only
thought
in
her
stupor
that
parlin
would
not
pay
her
for
dotty
lodging
if
the
child
was
blown
to
pieces
i
know
how
it
happened
said
she
twitching
at
her
own
hair
to
arouse
herself
just
as
abraham
always
said
the
rats
have
been
nibbling
matches
in
the
store
they
burned
a
hole
through
the
floor
and
set
fire
to
that
keg
of
gunpowder
yes
that
it
chapter
vii
playing
prisoner
i
know
how
it
happened
too
it
came
of
eating
sausages
rosenberg
after
she
was
fairly
awake
felt
so
uncomfortable
and
oppressed
that
she
went
up
stairs
to
see
if
the
children
were
safe
really
i
do
suppose
those
little
human
souls
were
precious
to
her
after
all
there
lay
mandoline
and
dotty
side
by
side
on
the
buffalo
skins
and
the
jewish
mother
stood
in
her
short
with
a
tallow
candle
in
her
hand
and
gazed
at
them
tenderly
that
horrible
dream
had
stirred
the
fountain
of
love
in
her
heart
they
made
a
beautiful
picture
and
there
was
no
stain
of
evil
in
their
young
faces
it
seems
as
if
the
angel
of
sleep
flies
away
with
loads
of
naughtiness
for
he
always
leaves
sleeping
children
looking
very
innocent
but
alas
he
brings
back
next
morning
all
he
carried
away
for
the
little
ones
wake
up
with
just
as
bad
hearts
as
ever
what
sweet
little
creeters
said
rosenberg
bending
over
and
kissing
them
both
just
like
seraphims
right
out
of
the
clouds
softly
madam
if
a
drop
of
tallow
should
fall
on
them
from
that
candle
they
might
take
to
themselves
wings
and
fly
away
that
was
what
cupid
did
in
the
fairy
story
and
you
are
in
yourself
rosenberg
you
are
still
half
asleep
she
looked
at
mandoline
perfect
little
hand
lying
outside
the
patchwork
quilt
it
does
seem
now
murmured
the
mother
with
a
tear
in
her
eye
that
i
could
ever
whack
them
pretty
fingers
with
a
thimble
i
do
believe
if
i
was
pestered
to
death
with
everything
under
the
sun
to
do
i
might
be
kind
o
decent
perhaps
the
poor
woman
told
the
truth
i
think
she
did
then
as
she
stood
there
she
breathed
a
little
prayer
without
any
words
not
for
herself
for
she
did
not
suppose
god
would
hear
but
for
her
children
that
she
banged
about
every
day
of
their
lives
she
was
not
really
a
jewess
for
she
had
no
religion
of
any
sort
and
never
went
to
church
but
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
little
overworked
mandoline
would
have
loved
her
mother
better
if
she
had
known
she
ever
prayed
for
her
at
all
in
the
morning
rosenberg
was
just
as
hard
and
sharp
as
ever
she
could
not
stop
to
be
pleasant
dotty
longed
to
get
away
but
she
was
an
exile
from
her
own
dear
home
whither
could
she
turn
it
was
a
cold
morning
and
the
children
ran
down
stairs
half
dressed
and
shivering
dotty
spread
out
her
stiff
red
fingers
before
the
like
the
sticks
of
a
fan
o
hum
thought
she
drearily
i
wish
i
could
see
the
red
coals
in
our
grate
my
mamma
would
let
me
go
to
the
table
with
such
hair
as
this
prudy
say
was
scarum
but
i
ca
brush
it
with
a
any
glass
so
there
dotty
curly
hair
looked
quite
as
respectable
as
mandoline
rosenberg
was
far
too
busy
to
attend
to
her
children
heads
they
might
be
rough
on
the
outside
and
full
of
mischief
inside
but
she
could
not
stop
to
inquire
what
a
dreadful
nice
breakfast
remarked
judith
rubbing
her
hands
and
accidentally
hitting
little
jacob
who
forthwith
spilled
some
molasses
on
the
clean
and
had
his
ears
boxed
in
consequence
it
was
very
evident
that
this
meal
was
a
much
better
one
than
usual
a
sort
of
festival
in
honor
of
dotty
dimple
dutch
cheese
and
pickles
and
gingerbread
and
green
and
yellow
dishes
were
mixed
up
together
as
if
they
had
been
stirred
about
with
a
spoon
dotty
had
not
intended
to
eat
a
mouthful
but
after
her
light
supper
of
the
night
before
she
was
really
hungry
and
in
spite
of
her
best
resolves
the
and
corncake
gradually
disappeared
from
her
plate
after
breakfast
she
felt
more
resigned
and
armed
herself
to
meet
her
fate
rosenberg
graciously
allowed
mandoline
to
lay
aside
her
tedious
knitting
and
give
her
undivided
attention
to
her
guest
dotty
had
no
heart
for
play
seems
as
if
i
should
choke
in
this
house
said
she
let
go
out
and
breathe
the
air
inside
the
house
was
rather
stifling
from
a
mixture
of
odors
and
soon
the
grocery
began
to
fill
with
men
and
boys
but
not
the
least
of
dotty
troubles
was
the
black
and
tan
dog
who
seemed
to
have
just
such
a
temper
as
rosenberg
and
would
certainly
have
scolded
if
he
had
had
the
gift
of
speech
the
two
little
girls
went
out
to
walk
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
street
where
the
grocery
stood
and
dotty
hurried
on
to
a
better
part
of
the
town
they
fluttered
about
for
two
or
three
hours
as
aimless
as
a
couple
of
white
butterflies
just
as
they
were
turning
to
go
back
to
the
dismal
little
grocery
which
dotty
thought
was
more
like
a
than
ever
they
met
and
parlin
riding
out
in
a
carriage
illustration
dotty
and
the
dog
dotty
felt
a
sudden
tumult
of
joy
and
shame
but
the
joy
was
uppermost
she
rushed
headlong
across
the
street
swinging
her
arms
and
startling
the
horse
who
supposed
she
was
some
new
and
improved
kind
of
windmill
dressed
up
in
a
little
girl
clothes
o
my
darling
mamma
my
darling
mamma
to
her
surprise
the
horse
did
not
stop
he
only
pricked
up
his
ears
and
looked
with
displeasure
at
the
windmill
but
kept
along
as
before
mamma
mamma
i
say
her
mother
never
even
looked
at
her
but
turned
her
gaze
to
the
blackened
trees
the
heaps
of
ruin
along
the
pavement
o
papa
o
stop
papa
it
me
it
dotty
parlin
bent
on
his
runaway
daughter
a
glance
of
indifference
and
called
out
in
passing
what
strange
little
girl
is
this
who
seems
to
know
us
so
well
it
like
my
daughter
alice
if
it
is
she
need
come
to
my
house
she
may
go
and
finish
her
visit
at
mrs
rosenberg
then
the
horse
trotted
on
indeed
he
had
never
paused
a
moment
and
carried
both
those
dear
dear
people
out
of
sight
what
did
they
mean
what
had
happened
to
dotty
dimple
that
her
own
father
and
mother
did
not
know
her
she
looked
down
at
the
skirt
of
her
dress
at
her
gaiters
at
her
little
bare
hands
to
make
sure
no
wicked
fairy
had
changed
her
not
that
she
suspected
any
such
thing
she
understood
but
too
well
what
her
father
and
mother
meant
they
knew
her
but
had
not
chosen
to
recognize
her
because
they
were
displeased
dotty
little
heart
the
swelling
of
which
had
net
gone
down
at
all
during
the
night
now
ached
terribly
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
groaned
aloud
do
said
mandoline
touched
with
pity
they
no
business
to
treat
you
so
o
lina
do
you
talk
you
do
know
anything
about
it
you
never
had
such
a
mother
they
are
and
now
they
wo
let
me
come
into
the
house
this
wail
of
despair
would
have
melted
parlin
if
she
could
have
heard
it
it
was
only
because
she
thought
it
necessary
to
be
severe
that
she
had
consented
to
do
as
her
husband
advised
and
turn
coldly
away
from
her
dear
little
daughter
dotty
was
a
loving
child
in
spite
of
her
disobedience
and
this
treatment
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
she
found
no
consolation
in
talking
with
lina
for
she
knew
lina
could
not
understand
her
feelings
she
has
any
susy
and
prudy
at
her
house
nor
no
thought
dotty
if
i
lived
with
rosenberg
and
that
dog
i
want
to
be
locked
out
i
ask
if
i
could
but
o
my
darling
mamma
i
been
naughty
too
many
times
when
i
been
naughty
fifty
sixty
five
hundred
times
then
she
forgave
me
but
now
she
ca
forgive
me
any
more
it
is
possible
dotty
staggered
against
a
girl
who
was
drawing
a
but
recovered
herself
it
is
possible
to
forgive
me
any
more
she
told
me
not
to
go
on
the
water
and
i
went
she
told
me
not
to
have
temper
and
i
had
it
every
single
thing
she
told
me
not
to
do
i
always
went
and
did
it
she
said
do
not
wish
you
to
play
with
lina
rosenberg
and
then
i
went
right
off
and
played
with
her
i
did
have
a
bit
good
time
but
nothing
she
hided
my
hat
lina
did
but
if
i
gone
home
straight
home
and
not
gone
to
her
house
then
she
could
have
hided
it
i
was
naughty
i
was
real
naughty
i
was
as
naughty
as
king
herod
and
king
pharaoh
nobody
ever
love
me
i
a
poor
child
got
a
mother
but
it
just
the
same
as
if
i
did
for
they
wo
let
me
call
by
it
o
they
did
die
but
they
wo
be
any
mother
to
me
strange
little
girl
is
this
that
what
my
papa
said
like
my
daughter
alice
o
i
wish
i
could
die
come
come
said
lina
let
go
home
mother
said
you
and
i
might
have
some
macaroni
cakes
and
lager
beer
if
we
would
let
the
rest
of
see
us
at
it
i
do
care
anything
about
your
beer
lina
rosenberg
nor
your
whiskey
and
tobacco
pipes
either
nor
neither
nor
nothing
added
the
desolate
child
standing
stock
still
with
the
back
of
her
head
against
a
pile
of
bricks
her
eyes
closed
and
her
hands
folded
across
her
bosom
there
there
you
a
pretty
sight
now
dotty
dimple
what
if
you
should
freeze
so
come
along
and
behave
i
ca
i
ca
if
you
do
dotty
i
have
to
go
into
that
barber
shop
i
know
the
man
and
i
make
him
carry
you
home
well
if
i
got
to
go
i
go
said
dotty
rousing
herself
and
starting
but
i
rather
be
dead
over
and
wish
i
was
so
there
chapter
viii
playing
thief
this
day
was
the
longest
one
to
be
found
in
the
almanac
it
was
longer
than
all
the
line
of
railroad
from
maine
to
indiana
and
back
again
dotty
shut
her
lips
together
and
suffered
in
silence
but
when
the
afternoon
was
half
spent
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
if
she
did
not
go
home
she
should
die
soldiers
had
died
of
homesickness
for
she
had
heard
her
father
say
so
she
had
not
been
able
to
swallow
a
mouthful
of
dinner
and
that
fact
was
of
itself
rather
alarming
perhaps
i
going
to
have
the
any
way
my
head
aches
besides
my
papa
did
say
i
go
home
he
said
i
must
finish
my
visit
and
i
o
i
finished
all
up
ever
and
ever
and
ever
so
long
ago
she
and
mandoline
went
out
again
to
breathe
rosenberg
giving
her
daughter
a
warning
glance
from
the
doorway
which
meant
be
watchful
mandy
for
the
look
of
fixed
despair
on
the
little
prisoner
face
gave
the
woman
some
anxiety
lest
she
should
try
to
escape
the
unhappy
child
walked
on
in
silence
twisting
a
lock
of
her
front
hair
and
looking
up
at
the
sky
a
few
soft
were
dropping
out
of
the
clouds
every
flake
seemed
to
fall
on
her
heart
winter
was
coming
it
was
a
gray
miserable
world
and
she
was
left
out
in
the
cold
she
remembered
she
had
been
happy
once
but
that
was
ages
ago
it
likely
she
should
ever
smile
again
and
as
for
laughter
she
knew
that
was
over
with
her
forever
susy
and
prudy
were
at
home
making
and
cologne
mats
could
smile
for
they
had
run
away
i
should
think
my
mamma
care
if
i
went
in
at
the
back
door
thought
dotty
meekly
if
she
locks
me
out
i
can
lie
down
on
the
steps
and
freeze
but
the
question
was
how
to
get
away
from
mandoline
who
had
her
in
charge
like
a
sheriff
that
the
street
i
turn
to
go
to
my
house
is
it
lina
asked
she
quickly
i
sha
tell
you
dotty
dimple
why
do
you
ask
i
going
home
i
sick
good
by
but
you
mus
go
a
step
dotty
dimple
yes
i
shall
you
not
my
mamma
lina
rosenberg
you
must
tell
me
what
to
do
well
i
going
everywhere
you
go
dotty
but
i
sha
say
whether
the
way
to
your
house
or
the
way
to
boston
and
do
know
dotty
was
not
to
be
so
easily
baffled
i
do
know
myself
lina
rosenberg
but
if
you
so
mean
as
not
to
tell
i
can
ask
somebody
else
that
tell
do
you
see
this
was
a
difficulty
which
lina
had
not
provided
for
she
was
very
sorry
dotty
had
come
out
to
breathe
very
soon
they
overtook
a
lady
who
pointed
out
the
right
street
to
dotty
and
it
was
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
one
she
was
taking
now
i
found
out
miss
rosenberg
and
you
ca
help
yourself
well
i
shall
go
with
you
dotty
just
the
same
i
shall
go
right
up
to
your
house
and
tell
your
mother
you
run
away
it
was
very
disagreeable
to
miss
dimple
to
be
pursued
in
this
way
but
she
put
on
an
air
of
defiance
i
should
think
you
want
to
go
where
you
was
wanted
miss
rosenberg
lina
had
never
intended
to
do
such
a
thing
she
had
not
courage
enough
o
dear
what
shall
i
do
to
make
you
go
back
with
me
my
mother
scold
me
awfully
for
letting
you
get
away
well
there
you
got
the
dreadfulest
mother
lina
and
i
real
sorry
but
it
no
use
to
tease
me
i
would
go
back
not
if
you
should
cut
me
up
into
little
pieces
as
big
as
a
cent
lina
was
ready
to
fall
upon
her
knees
right
on
the
pavement
she
offered
dotty
paper
dolls
enough
to
people
a
colony
but
miss
dimple
was
as
firm
as
a
rock
now
her
face
was
once
set
towards
home
lina
turned
on
her
heel
and
slowly
walked
away
dotty
called
after
her
there
lina
now
you
told
an
awful
story
you
said
you
go
to
my
house
and
tell
my
mother
i
run
away
again
and
now
you
do
dare
go
so
you
told
an
awful
wicked
story
with
this
parting
thrust
at
her
tormentor
dotty
turned
again
to
the
misery
of
her
own
thoughts
her
home
was
already
in
sight
but
the
uncertainty
as
to
her
reception
there
made
her
little
feet
falter
in
their
course
her
head
sank
lower
and
lower
till
her
chin
snuggled
into
the
hollow
of
her
neck
and
her
eyes
peered
out
keenly
from
under
her
hat
to
make
sure
no
one
was
watching
there
was
a
on
one
side
of
the
house
she
touched
the
as
gently
as
if
it
had
been
a
loaded
gun
and
crept
noiselessly
along
to
the
side
door
here
she
paused
her
heart
throbbed
loudly
but
in
spite
of
that
she
could
hear
norah
walking
about
and
rattling
the
covers
of
the
stove
as
she
put
in
coal
dotty
courage
failed
what
if
norah
should
make
believe
she
did
know
her
and
shut
the
door
in
her
face
i
ca
see
norah
and
hear
her
say
strange
little
girl
is
this
it
like
our
alice
but
it
ca
be
any
such
a
child
no
i
see
anybody
i
finished
my
visit
i
have
a
right
to
come
home
but
they
wo
think
so
i
feel
if
i
was
half
so
good
as
or
or
continued
she
with
a
pang
of
despair
i
know
what
i
do
i
go
down
cellar
that
where
the
rats
stay
and
if
i
bad
i
hope
i
as
good
as
a
rat
for
i
do
bite
one
of
the
cellar
windows
had
been
left
out
in
order
to
admit
coal
through
this
window
crept
dotty
regardless
of
her
white
stockings
and
crimson
dress
when
she
had
fairly
got
her
head
through
the
opening
and
was
no
longer
afraid
of
being
seen
she
breathed
more
freely
here
i
am
not
a
bit
of
me
out
but
i
must
go
on
my
or
they
hear
me
and
think
it
a
there
was
quite
a
steep
hill
to
walk
over
and
she
found
it
anything
but
a
path
of
roses
once
or
twice
she
stumbled
and
fell
upon
her
hands
and
knees
seems
to
me
said
she
drawing
out
her
foot
which
had
sunk
above
the
ankle
in
coal
seems
to
me
i
have
as
many
feet
as
a
caterpillar
but
she
kept
on
down
the
hill
of
difficulty
till
she
reached
solid
ground
it
was
not
a
very
cheerful
apartment
that
is
certain
the
light
had
much
difficulty
in
getting
in
at
the
little
windows
and
when
it
did
fight
its
way
through
it
was
not
good
for
much
it
was
a
gloomy
light
and
looked
as
if
it
had
had
a
hard
time
dotty
went
up
to
the
furnace
for
comfort
it
was
a
tall
black
thing
doing
its
best
to
give
warmth
and
cheer
to
the
rooms
up
stairs
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
the
cellar
it
was
like
some
brilliant
people
who
shine
in
society
but
are
dull
and
stupid
at
home
dotty
opened
the
furnace
door
and
tried
to
warm
her
cold
fingers
why
my
hands
are
as
black
as
a
sighed
she
as
if
she
could
have
expected
anything
else
there
did
not
seem
to
be
one
ray
of
hope
in
her
little
dark
soul
she
had
no
tears
to
shed
she
seldom
had
but
when
she
was
in
trouble
she
was
always
in
the
lowest
depths
pretty
well
for
me
to
make
believe
i
was
a
thief
and
was
going
to
steal
is
this
strange
little
girl
said
he
like
she
heard
voices
near
the
cellar
door
what
if
norah
should
come
down
after
butter
dotty
was
not
prepared
for
that
she
could
not
hide
in
the
keg
of
lard
of
course
and
what
she
do
my
head
is
tipside
up
i
ca
think
then
she
began
to
wonder
how
long
she
could
live
down
there
in
case
she
was
not
discovered
i
i
can
climb
up
on
the
swing
shelf
and
sleep
there
nights
i
can
hide
behind
things
in
the
daytime
and
when
i
hungry
i
can
eat
out
of
the
jars
and
boxes
the
sound
of
voices
came
down
distinctly
from
the
kitchen
overhead
dotty
crouched
behind
an
apple
barrel
and
listened
grandma
read
was
talking
to
parlin
who
seemed
to
be
in
another
room
mary
my
glasses
gone
this
time
said
she
if
little
alice
were
only
here
i
should
set
her
to
hunting
she
do
know
i
in
the
house
this
minute
thought
dotty
no
the
house
dear
me
with
that
she
walked
softly
up
the
stairs
and
listened
at
the
for
the
sound
of
her
grandmother
voice
was
encouraging
and
dotty
in
her
loneliness
longed
to
be
near
the
dear
people
of
the
family
even
if
she
could
not
see
them
edward
said
her
mother
what
music
there
was
in
her
voice
if
you
are
going
after
that
dear
child
you
better
take
a
shawl
to
wrap
her
in
for
it
is
snowing
fast
and
be
sure
to
tell
her
we
love
her
dearly
every
one
of
us
and
do
believe
she
will
ever
run
away
again
o
was
her
papa
going
after
her
did
they
love
her
after
all
were
they
willing
to
keep
her
in
the
house
dotty
opened
the
door
before
she
knew
it
o
mamma
mamma
cried
she
rushing
into
her
mother
arms
why
dotty
you
darling
child
where
did
you
come
from
exclaimed
parlin
in
great
surprise
kissing
the
little
dirty
girl
and
taking
her
right
to
her
heart
in
spite
of
the
if
you
let
me
stay
at
home
gasped
dotty
if
you
me
stay
at
home
i
live
in
the
kitchen
and
wo
go
near
the
table
where
come
from
said
parlin
kissing
a
clean
place
on
dotty
black
face
and
laughing
under
his
breath
i
came
through
the
cellar
window
papa
through
the
cellar
window
child
yes
papa
i
did
you
care
care
my
dear
your
mother
is
the
one
to
care
just
look
at
your
stockings
there
was
coal
there
thrown
in
said
dotty
with
a
quivering
lip
and
i
had
to
walk
over
it
and
under
it
and
through
it
was
my
little
daughter
afraid
to
come
in
by
the
door
i
did
know
you
wanted
me
papa
i
thought
you
say
strange
child
is
this
parlin
looking
at
the
black
streaks
on
dotty
woeful
face
found
it
very
difficult
to
keep
from
laughing
a
strange
child
she
appeared
to
be
certainly
but
i
got
my
visit
all
finished
up
ever
and
ever
so
long
ago
so
you
really
chose
to
come
back
to
us
my
dear
o
papa
you
do
know
did
you
think
did
you
here
dotty
broke
down
completely
and
seizing
her
father
in
both
her
grimy
hands
she
buried
her
face
in
it
and
sprinkled
it
with
tears
of
ink
there
was
great
surprise
throughout
the
house
when
dotty
arrival
became
known
we
did
know
how
to
live
without
you
any
longer
said
prudy
and
tomorrow
thanksgiving
day
but
i
never
should
have
come
up
said
dotty
if
i
had
heard
mamma
talk
about
loving
me
just
the
same
i
never
have
come
up
excuse
me
for
smiling
said
prudy
but
you
look
as
if
you
had
fallen
into
the
inkstand
it
is
funny
dotty
was
not
at
all
amused
herself
but
after
she
was
dressed
in
clean
clothes
she
felt
very
happy
and
enjoyed
her
supper
remarkably
well
the
thought
that
they
did
know
how
to
live
without
her
gave
a
relish
to
every
mouthful
it
was
a
delightful
evening
to
the
little
wanderer
the
parlor
looked
so
cheerful
in
the
rosy
firelight
that
dotty
thought
she
would
like
to
kiss
every
single
thing
in
the
room
it
was
unpleasant
out
of
doors
and
the
wind
blew
as
if
all
the
people
in
the
world
were
deaf
and
must
be
made
to
hear
but
dotty
did
not
mind
that
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
said
to
prudy
seems
as
if
the
wind
had
blown
out
all
the
stars
but
no
matter
is
it
it
is
all
nice
in
the
house
then
she
dropped
the
curtain
and
went
to
sit
in
her
mother
lap
not
a
word
of
reproach
had
been
uttered
by
any
one
yet
for
it
was
thought
the
child
had
suffered
enough
mamma
said
dotty
laying
her
tired
head
on
her
mother
bosom
you
think
i
like
the
prodigal
daughter
yesterday
i
felt
a
whisper
down
in
my
mind
i
did
hear
it
but
i
it
and
it
said
must
disobey
your
mamma
you
must
play
with
lina
rosenberg
only
think
my
child
if
you
had
only
paid
attention
to
that
whisper
yes
mamma
but
i
tried
to
forget
it
and
by
and
by
i
did
forget
it
almost
there
one
thing
i
know
added
dotty
clasping
her
hands
together
i
never
run
away
again
if
i
going
to
i
catch
myself
by
the
shoulder
and
hold
on
just
as
hard
my
blessed
child
i
hope
so
said
parfin
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
stronger
faith
in
her
heart
than
she
had
felt
for
many
a
day
that
dotty
really
meant
to
do
better
you
do
know
how
it
did
distress
your
papa
and
me
to
have
you
stay
in
that
house
a
night
and
a
day
but
we
hoped
it
would
prove
a
lesson
to
you
we
meant
it
for
your
best
good
to
make
sure
the
lesson
would
not
be
forgotten
prudy
read
her
little
sister
a
private
lecture
she
had
written
it
that
afternoon
with
carmine
ink
on
the
nicest
of
tinted
paper
dotty
received
it
very
humbly
and
laid
it
away
in
the
rosewood
box
with
her
precious
things
prudy
lecture
we
must
keep
good
company
dotty
or
not
any
at
all
this
is
a
fact
even
an
apple
is
known
by
the
company
it
keeps
grandpa
parlin
says
if
you
put
apples
in
a
potato
bin
they
wo
taste
like
apples
taste
like
potatoes
sometimes
i
think
dotty
you
be
as
good
and
nice
as
a
if
you
would
play
with
naughty
children
like
lina
rosenberg
but
if
you
do
you
be
like
a
potato
as
true
as
you
live
finis
chapter
ix
thanksgiving
day
the
next
day
was
thanksgiving
dotty
wakened
in
such
a
happy
mood
that
it
seemed
to
her
the
world
had
never
looked
so
bright
before
i
do
think
prudy
it
the
turkey
and
plum
pudding
we
going
to
have
that
makes
me
so
happy
do
you
what
is
it
then
little
sister
o
it
i
dreamed
i
was
sleeping
on
and
woke
up
and
found
i
was
you
feel
a
great
deal
better
prudy
if
you
run
away
and
had
such
a
dreadful
time
and
got
home
again
i
do
want
to
try
it
returned
prudy
with
a
smile
no
but
it
so
nice
to
be
forgiven
said
dotty
laying
her
hand
on
her
heart
it
makes
you
feel
so
easy
right
in
here
a
fear
came
over
prudy
that
the
little
runaway
had
not
been
punished
enough
but
dotty
went
on
it
makes
you
feel
as
if
you
never
be
naughty
again
now
if
my
mamma
was
always
thumping
me
with
a
thimble
and
scolding
me
so
as
to
shake
the
house
i
should
care
but
when
she
is
just
like
an
angel
and
forgives
me
i
care
i
so
glad
dotty
i
think
honestly
mother
the
best
woman
that
ever
lived
then
why
did
she
marry
the
best
man
asked
dotty
quickly
who
is
that
why
abraham
lincoln
of
course
prudy
laughed
yes
i
suppose
lincoln
was
the
best
man
that
ever
lived
but
papa
comes
next
yes
said
dotty
i
think
he
does
and
i
rather
have
him
for
a
father
than
lincoln
i
better
with
him
i
should
dare
kiss
the
president
and
besides
that
he
dead
you
a
funny
girl
dotty
but
what
you
say
is
true
everything
happens
just
right
in
this
world
does
it
said
dotty
wrinkling
her
brows
anxiously
does
it
now
truly
yes
indeed
dotty
anybody
would
think
so
but
it
does
then
i
suppose
it
happens
right
for
me
to
be
a
bad
girl
and
run
away
no
indeed
dotty
because
you
can
help
it
everything
is
right
that
we
help
that
what
i
mean
then
i
was
right
for
me
to
crawl
through
the
cellar
window
said
dotty
for
i
sure
i
could
help
it
o
dear
me
you
ask
such
queer
questions
that
i
ca
answer
them
dotty
dimple
all
i
know
is
this
everything
happens
just
right
in
this
world
you
ca
help
with
which
sage
remark
prudy
stepped
out
of
bed
and
began
to
dress
herself
dotty
planted
her
elbow
in
the
pillow
and
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
i
do
believe
it
happens
just
right
for
rosenberg
to
keep
that
dog
or
to
thump
so
with
a
thimble
but
then
i
do
know
i
hurrying
to
get
dressed
said
prudy
the
first
bell
has
rung
why
i
never
heard
it
cried
dotty
springing
up
i
would
be
late
for
anything
prudy
looked
anxiously
at
her
little
sister
to
see
if
she
was
cross
but
her
face
was
as
serene
as
the
cloudless
sky
she
had
waked
up
right
and
meant
to
be
good
all
day
when
dotty
had
one
of
her
especially
good
days
prudy
cup
of
happiness
was
full
she
ran
down
stairs
singing
thank
god
for
pleasant
weather
shout
it
merrily
ye
hills
and
clap
your
hands
together
ye
exulting
little
rills
thank
him
bird
and
birdling
as
ye
grow
and
sing
mingle
in
thanksgiving
every
living
thing
every
living
thing
every
living
thing
dotty
was
so
anxious
to
redeem
her
character
in
everybody
eyes
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
parlin
sent
her
into
the
kitchen
with
a
message
to
norah
concerning
the
turkey
but
she
forgot
it
on
the
way
and
stood
by
norah
elbow
gazing
at
the
raisins
fruit
and
other
nice
things
in
a
maze
what
did
my
mamma
send
me
here
for
she
ought
to
said
it
over
twice
any
way
norah
now
i
think
of
it
i
wish
you
please
would
starch
my
aprons
on
the
inside
starch
on
the
outside
they
rub
against
my
neck
go
back
and
see
what
your
mamma
wants
said
norah
laughing
why
mamma
cried
dotty
reappearing
in
the
parlor
quite
crestfallen
why
mamma
i
went
right
up
to
norah
to
ask
her
and
asked
her
something
else
my
head
spins
dreadfully
parlin
repeated
the
message
and
dotty
delivered
it
this
time
correctly
adding
now
norah
i
all
dressed
for
dinner
so
i
can
do
something
for
you
just
as
well
as
not
such
days
as
this
when
you
have
so
much
to
do
you
ought
to
let
me
help
to
dotty
surprise
norah
found
this
suggestion
rather
amusing
for
mercy
sake
said
she
i
have
got
my
hands
full
now
and
when
you
are
round
miss
dotty
and
have
one
of
your
good
fits
it
seems
as
if
i
should
fly
what
do
you
mean
by
a
good
fit
why
you
have
spells
child
you
know
you
do
when
butter
would
melt
in
your
mouth
do
i
said
dotty
i
thought
butter
always
melted
in
anybody
mouth
does
it
make
my
mouth
cold
to
be
good
d
la
me
i
do
know
replied
the
girl
washing
a
potato
vigorously
might
wash
those
potatoes
said
dotty
plucking
norah
sleeve
do
you
put
soap
on
them
not
much
soap
no
well
then
norah
you
should
put
soap
on
them
that
why
i
asked
for
my
mother
just
washes
and
rinses
that
the
proper
way
for
pity
sake
said
norah
giving
the
little
busybody
a
push
what
going
on
in
the
parlor
miss
dotty
you
better
run
and
see
if
you
should
go
in
there
and
look
out
of
the
window
perhaps
a
monkey
would
come
along
with
an
organ
no
he
would
norah
and
if
he
did
prudy
let
me
know
as
dotty
spoke
she
was
employed
in
slicing
an
onion
while
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
but
a
scream
from
norah
caused
her
to
drop
the
knife
why
what
is
it
said
dotty
ugh
it
some
horrid
little
crawling
down
my
neck
let
me
get
him
cried
dotty
seizing
a
pin
and
rushing
at
poor
norah
who
tried
in
vain
to
ward
off
the
pin
and
at
the
same
time
catch
the
spider
you
let
me
alone
child
no
no
i
want
the
bug
myself
cried
dotty
pricking
norah
on
the
cheek
want
the
bug
yes
may
i
stick
him
through
with
a
pin
from
ear
to
ear
i
know
a
lady
out
west
that
making
a
of
bugs
well
here
he
is
then
and
a
pretty
scrape
i
had
catching
him
thanks
be
to
you
all
the
same
miss
dimple
as
it
turned
out
to
be
only
a
dotty
shook
her
head
in
disdain
and
went
on
slicing
onions
sure
now
said
norah
i
should
think
you
be
wanting
to
go
and
see
what
become
of
your
sister
prudy
maybe
she
off
on
the
street
somewhere
and
never
asked
you
to
go
with
her
now
you
telling
a
hint
exclaimed
dotty
making
a
dash
at
a
turnip
i
know
what
you
mean
by
your
monkeys
and
things
you
want
to
get
me
away
it
not
polite
to
tell
hints
norah
my
mamma
says
so
but
as
dotty
began
to
see
that
she
really
was
not
wanted
she
concluded
to
go
though
she
must
have
it
seem
that
she
went
of
her
own
accord
and
not
because
of
norah
hints
did
you
think
it
was
a
buggler
when
i
opened
the
last
night
norah
no
i
ca
say
as
i
did
not
when
i
looked
at
you
replied
norah
gravely
i
going
into
the
parlor
to
ask
mother
if
thought
i
was
a
buggler
i
believe
i
wo
help
you
any
more
now
norah
come
out
by
and
by
so
dotty
skipped
away
but
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
been
troublesome
she
merely
thought
it
very
strange
norah
did
not
appreciate
her
services
i
she
knows
mother
help
her
if
i
do
said
she
to
herself
dotty
goodness
ran
on
with
a
ceaseless
flow
till
two
when
that
event
took
place
which
the
children
regarded
as
the
most
important
one
of
the
day
that
is
dinner
after
the
silent
blessing
parlin
turned
to
his
youngest
daughter
and
said
alice
do
you
know
what
thanksgiving
day
is
for
yes
sir
for
turkey
is
that
all
no
sir
for
plum
pudding
what
do
you
think
about
it
prudy
i
think
the
same
as
dotty
does
sir
replied
prudy
with
a
wistful
glance
at
her
father
right
hand
which
held
the
carving
knife
what
do
you
say
susy
it
comes
in
the
almanac
just
like
christmas
sir
and
it
something
about
the
pilgrim
fathers
and
the
mayflower
no
susy
it
does
not
come
in
the
almanac
the
governor
appoints
it
we
have
so
many
blessings
that
he
sets
apart
one
day
in
the
year
in
which
we
are
to
think
them
over
and
be
thankful
for
them
yes
sir
yes
indeed
said
susy
i
knew
that
now
before
i
carve
the
turkey
what
if
i
ask
the
question
all
around
what
we
feel
most
thankful
for
we
will
begin
with
grandmamma
if
thee
asks
me
first
said
grandma
read
clasping
her
beautiful
old
hands
i
shall
say
i
have
everything
to
be
thankful
for
but
i
am
most
thankful
for
peace
thee
knows
how
i
feel
about
war
the
children
thought
this
a
strange
answer
they
had
almost
forgotten
there
had
ever
been
a
war
now
mary
what
have
you
to
say
asked
parlin
of
his
wife
i
am
thankful
we
are
all
alive
replied
parlin
looking
at
the
faces
around
the
table
with
a
loving
smile
and
i
said
her
husband
am
thankful
we
all
have
our
eyesight
i
have
thought
more
about
it
since
i
have
visited
two
or
three
blind
asylums
susy
it
is
your
turn
papa
i
thankful
i
so
near
thirteen
parlin
stroked
his
mustache
to
hide
a
smile
he
thought
that
was
a
very
remark
and
you
prudy
i
so
thankful
sir
answered
prudy
reflecting
a
while
so
thankful
house
is
burnt
up
bless
your
little
grateful
heart
said
her
father
leaning
towards
her
and
stroking
her
cheek
for
my
part
i
think
one
fire
is
quite
enough
for
one
family
i
confess
i
never
should
have
dreamed
of
being
thankful
we
had
had
well
alice
what
have
you
to
say
i
see
a
thought
in
your
eyes
why
papa
said
dotty
laying
her
forefingers
together
with
emphasis
i
known
what
i
thankful
for
for
two
days
i
thankful
rosenberg
is
my
mother
a
smile
went
around
the
table
but
papa
i
am
truly
what
should
i
want
for
a
mother
for
indeed
i
see
no
reason
my
child
since
you
already
have
a
pretty
good
mother
of
your
own
pretty
good
papa
said
dotty
in
a
tone
of
mild
reproof
why
if
she
was
your
mother
you
think
she
was
good
granted
returned
parlin
i
do
think
you
like
it
papa
to
have
her
scold
so
she
shakes
down
cobwebs
who
mrs
rosenberg
never
mind
my
dear
we
will
not
discuss
that
woman
i
hope
you
will
some
time
learn
to
pronounce
her
name
then
followed
a
few
remarks
from
parlin
upon
our
duty
to
the
giver
of
all
good
things
after
which
he
began
at
last
to
carve
the
turkey
the
children
thought
it
was
certainly
time
he
did
so
they
were
afraid
their
thankfulness
would
die
out
if
they
did
not
have
something
to
eat
pretty
soon
chapter
grandma
old
times
grandma
read
was
in
her
own
room
sitting
before
a
bright
clean
fire
she
did
not
like
coal
she
said
it
made
too
much
dust
so
she
always
used
wood
she
sat
with
her
knitting
in
her
hands
clicking
the
needles
merrily
while
she
looked
into
the
coals
people
can
see
a
great
many
things
in
coals
just
now
she
saw
the
face
of
her
dear
husband
who
had
long
ago
been
buried
out
of
her
sight
he
had
a
hat
on
his
head
and
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
for
he
had
been
a
funny
man
and
very
fond
of
a
joke
grandma
smiled
as
if
she
could
almost
hear
him
tell
one
of
his
droll
stories
presently
there
was
a
little
tap
at
the
door
grandma
roused
herself
and
looked
up
to
see
who
was
coming
walk
in
said
she
walk
in
my
dear
yes
we
came
to
walk
in
replied
a
cheery
voice
and
prudy
and
dotty
danced
into
the
room
with
their
arms
about
each
other
waists
o
how
pleasant
it
seems
in
here
said
prudy
when
i
come
in
i
always
feel
just
like
singing
thee
likes
my
clean
fire
said
grandma
but
grandma
said
dotty
i
should
think
you
be
lonesome
anybody
but
no
my
dear
the
room
is
always
full
full
grandma
yes
full
of
the
children
looked
about
but
they
only
two
sunny
windows
a
table
with
books
on
it
and
a
pair
of
gold
fishes
a
bed
with
snowy
coverlet
and
very
high
pillows
a
green
and
white
carpet
a
mahogany
bureau
and
and
then
the
bright
fireplace
with
a
marble
mantel
and
a
pair
of
gilt
bellows
hanging
on
a
brass
nail
it
was
a
very
neat
and
cheerful
room
but
they
could
not
understand
why
there
should
be
any
more
memories
in
it
than
there
were
in
any
other
part
of
the
house
we
old
people
live
very
much
in
the
past
said
grandma
read
prudence
if
thee
pick
up
this
stitch
for
me
i
will
tell
thee
what
i
was
thinking
of
when
thee
and
alice
came
in
so
saying
she
held
out
the
little
red
mitten
she
was
knitting
and
at
the
same
time
took
the
spectacles
off
her
nose
and
offered
them
to
prudy
prudy
laughed
why
grandma
my
eyes
are
as
good
as
can
be
i
do
wear
glasses
so
thee
does
child
surely
i
am
a
little
thinking
of
old
mother
knowles
grandma
please
wait
a
minute
said
prudy
after
she
had
picked
up
the
stitch
if
you
are
going
to
tell
a
story
i
want
to
get
my
work
and
bring
it
in
here
i
in
a
hurry
about
that
scarf
for
mamma
it
is
nothing
very
remarkable
said
read
as
the
children
seated
themselves
one
on
each
side
of
her
prudy
with
her
crocheting
of
violet
and
white
worsted
and
dotty
with
nothing
at
all
to
do
but
play
with
the
tongs
knowles
was
a
very
large
fleshy
woman
who
lived
near
my
house
when
i
was
a
little
girl
some
people
were
very
much
afraid
of
her
and
thought
her
a
witch
her
sister
husband
palmer
got
very
angry
with
her
and
declared
she
bewitched
his
cattle
did
she
grandma
asked
dotty
no
indeed
my
dear
and
could
have
done
it
if
she
had
tried
then
was
very
for
him
to
say
so
he
was
a
lazy
man
and
did
not
take
proper
care
of
his
animals
sometimes
he
came
over
and
talked
with
my
mother
about
his
trials
with
his
wicked
he
said
he
often
went
to
the
barn
in
the
morning
and
found
his
poor
cattle
had
walked
up
to
the
top
of
the
scaffold
and
how
could
they
do
that
unless
they
were
bewitched
did
they
truly
do
it
i
know
what
the
scaffold
is
it
is
a
high
place
where
you
look
for
hen
eggs
yes
i
believe
the
cows
did
really
walk
up
there
but
this
was
the
way
it
happened
alice
they
were
not
properly
fastened
into
their
stalls
and
being
very
hungry
they
went
into
the
barn
for
something
to
eat
the
barn
floor
was
covered
with
hay
and
there
was
a
hill
of
hay
which
led
right
up
to
the
scaffold
so
they
could
get
there
well
enough
without
being
bewitched
did
your
mother
my
believe
in
witches
asked
prudy
what
did
she
say
to
mr
palmer
o
no
she
had
no
faith
in
witches
thy
great
grandmother
was
a
sensible
woman
she
said
to
him
friend
asa
thee
better
have
some
good
strong
bows
made
for
thy
cattle
and
put
on
their
necks
and
then
i
think
thee
find
they
ca
get
out
of
their
stalls
thee
says
they
are
as
lean
as
pharaoh
kine
and
i
would
advise
thee
to
feed
them
better
cattle
that
are
well
fed
and
well
cared
for
will
never
go
bewitched
did
knowles
know
what
people
said
about
her
asked
prudy
yes
she
heard
the
stories
and
it
made
her
feel
very
badly
how
did
she
look
a
little
like
thy
grandmother
parlin
if
i
remember
only
she
was
much
larger
did
she
know
anything
o
yes
it
was
rather
an
ignorant
neighborhood
but
she
was
one
of
the
most
intelligent
women
in
it
did
she
ever
go
anywhere
yes
she
came
to
my
mother
for
sympathy
i
remember
just
how
she
looked
in
her
tow
and
linen
dress
with
her
hair
fastened
at
the
back
of
the
head
with
a
there
there
cried
dotty
that
was
what
made
call
her
a
witch
o
no
a
was
quite
a
common
fashion
in
those
times
and
a
great
deal
prettier
too
than
the
waterfalls
thee
sees
nowadays
knowles
dressed
like
other
people
and
looked
like
other
people
for
aught
i
know
but
i
wished
she
would
not
come
to
our
house
so
much
did
you
like
her
yes
i
liked
her
very
well
for
she
carried
peppermints
in
a
black
bag
on
her
arm
but
i
was
afraid
the
stories
were
true
and
she
might
bewitch
my
mother
why
grandma
i
should
have
thought
that
of
i
was
a
very
small
girl
then
prudence
and
the
children
i
played
with
belonged
for
the
most
part
to
ignorant
families
grandma
was
like
an
apple
playing
with
potatoes
remarked
dotty
one
side
to
prudy
i
used
to
watch
knowles
continued
read
hoping
to
see
her
cry
for
they
said
if
she
was
really
a
witch
she
could
shed
but
three
tears
and
those
out
of
her
left
eye
did
you
ever
catch
her
crying
once
replied
grandma
with
a
smile
and
then
she
kept
her
handkerchief
at
her
face
i
was
quite
disappointed
for
i
could
tell
which
eye
she
cried
out
of
please
tell
some
more
said
dotty
they
said
knowles
was
often
seen
in
a
high
wind
riding
off
on
a
broomstick
it
ought
to
have
been
a
strong
broomstick
for
she
was
a
very
large
woman
why
grandma
said
prudy
thrusting
her
hook
into
a
stitch
i
help
thinking
what
queer
days
you
lived
in
now
when
i
talk
to
grandchildren
i
shall
tell
them
of
such
beautiful
things
of
swings
and
picnics
and
christmas
trees
so
shall
i
to
grandchildren
said
dotty
but
not
always
i
shall
have
to
look
sober
sometimes
and
tell
how
i
had
the
sore
throat
and
could
swallow
anything
but
boiled
custards
and
cream
toast
says
i
it
was
different
in
those
days
ah
well
you
little
folks
look
forward
and
we
old
folks
look
backward
but
it
all
seems
like
a
dream
either
way
to
me
said
grandma
read
binding
off
the
thumb
of
her
little
red
mitten
like
a
dream
when
it
is
told
speaking
of
telling
dreams
grandma
i
had
a
funny
one
last
night
said
prudy
about
a
queer
old
gentleman
guess
who
it
was
thy
grandfather
perhaps
does
thee
remember
alice
how
thee
used
to
sit
on
his
knee
and
comb
his
hair
with
a
toothpick
i
do
think
was
me
said
dotty
for
i
was
born
then
it
was
i
replied
prudy
i
remember
grandpa
now
but
i
did
use
to
it
was
grandpa
i
dreamed
about
it
was
santa
claus
grandma
smiled
and
raised
her
spectacles
to
the
top
of
her
forehead
we
never
talked
about
fairies
in
my
day
said
she
i
never
heard
of
a
santa
claus
when
i
was
young
well
grandma
he
came
down
the
chimney
in
a
coach
that
looked
like
a
quaker
bonnet
on
wheels
but
he
was
all
with
gold
buttons
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
something
very
foolish
i
presume
he
said
prudy
i
going
to
be
married
only
think
and
he
such
a
very
old
bachelor
did
thee
dream
out
the
bride
it
was
mother
goose
very
well
said
read
smiling
i
should
think
that
was
a
very
good
match
she
did
look
so
funny
grandma
with
a
great
hump
on
her
nose
and
one
on
her
back
santa
claus
kissed
her
and
what
do
you
think
she
said
i
am
sure
i
ca
tell
i
am
not
acquainted
with
thy
fairy
folks
why
she
shook
her
sides
and
said
she
a
song
o
sixpence
that
was
as
sensible
a
speech
as
thee
could
expect
from
that
quarter
o
grandma
you
do
care
anything
about
my
dream
or
i
could
go
on
and
describe
the
how
she
put
sage
in
it
and
pepper
and
mustard
and
baked
it
on
top
of
one
of
our
registers
what
do
you
suppose
made
me
dream
such
a
queer
thing
thee
was
probably
thinking
of
thy
mother
wedding
o
christmas
is
going
to
be
splendided
than
ever
this
year
said
dotty
is
it
grandma
did
you
have
any
christmases
when
you
were
young
o
yes
but
we
did
make
much
account
of
christmas
in
those
days
why
grandma
i
knew
you
lived
on
bean
porridge
but
i
you
had
something
to
eat
christmas
o
sometimes
i
had
a
little
sweetened
with
molasses
and
the
crust
made
of
raised
dough
poor
dear
grandma
i
remember
my
father
used
to
put
a
great
backlog
on
the
fire
christmas
morning
as
large
as
the
fireplace
would
hold
and
that
was
all
the
celebration
we
ever
had
did
you
have
christmas
presents
no
alice
not
so
much
as
a
brass
thimble
poor
grandma
i
should
think
you
would
have
wanted
to
live
anybody
love
you
said
dotty
putting
her
fingers
under
read
cap
and
smoothing
her
soft
gray
hair
why
i
love
every
hair
of
your
head
i
am
glad
thee
does
child
but
that
does
take
much
love
for
thee
knows
i
have
a
great
deal
of
hair
but
grandma
how
could
you
live
without
christmas
trees
and
things
i
was
happy
enough
alice
but
you
have
been
a
great
deal
happier
grandma
if
you
had
a
santa
claus
it
so
nice
to
believe
what
is
true
ah
does
thee
think
so
there
was
one
thing
i
believed
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
and
it
was
not
true
i
believed
the
cattle
knelt
at
midnight
on
christmas
eve
knelt
grandma
for
what
because
our
blessed
lord
was
born
in
a
manger
but
they
did
know
that
cows
ca
read
the
bible
it
was
an
idle
story
of
course
like
the
one
about
mother
knowles
a
man
who
worked
at
our
house
israel
grossman
told
it
to
me
and
i
thought
it
was
true
here
grandma
gazed
into
the
coals
again
she
could
see
israel
grossman
sitting
on
a
stump
whittling
a
stick
and
puffing
away
at
a
short
pipe
well
children
said
she
i
have
talked
to
you
long
enough
about
things
that
are
past
and
gone
on
the
whole
i
do
say
they
were
good
old
times
for
the
times
now
are
a
great
deal
better
yes
indeed
said
prudy
except
one
thing
added
grandma
looking
at
dotty
who
was
snapping
the
tongs
together
children
had
more
to
do
in
my
day
than
they
have
now
dotty
blushed
grandma
said
she
i
having
a
playtime
you
know
there
anybody
stop
to
fix
my
work
but
mother
says
after
the
holidays
i
going
to
have
a
stint
every
day
that
right
dear
now
thee
may
run
down
and
get
me
a
skein
of
red
yarn
thee
will
find
on
the
top
shelf
in
the
nursery
closet
chapter
xi
the
crystal
wedding
as
the
crystal
wedding
was
to
take
place
on
the
the
christmas
tree
was
deferred
till
the
night
after
and
was
not
looked
forward
too
by
the
children
as
anything
very
important
they
had
had
a
tree
a
kris
kringle
or
something
of
the
sort
every
year
since
they
could
remember
but
a
wedding
was
a
rare
event
and
to
be
a
bridesmaid
was
as
great
an
honor
dotty
thought
as
could
be
conferred
on
any
little
girl
it
was
intended
that
everything
should
be
as
much
as
possible
like
the
original
wedding
parlin
was
to
wear
the
same
silk
and
bridal
veil
she
had
worn
then
and
parlin
the
same
coat
and
white
vest
though
they
were
decidedly
out
of
fashion
by
this
time
dotty
was
resplendent
in
a
white
dress
with
a
long
sash
a
gold
necklace
of
her
aunt
eastman
and
a
pair
of
white
kid
slippers
johnny
was
to
be
groomsman
he
was
a
boy
who
was
always
startling
his
friends
with
some
new
idea
and
this
time
he
had
borrowed
a
silver
out
of
his
mother
drawer
and
filled
it
with
the
loveliest
greenhouse
flowers
until
dotty
saw
this
she
had
been
happy
but
the
thought
of
standing
up
with
a
boy
who
held
such
a
beautiful
toy
while
her
own
little
hands
would
be
empty
this
was
too
much
johnny
eastman
said
she
with
a
trembling
voice
how
do
you
think
it
will
look
to
be
holding
flowers
up
to
your
nose
when
the
i
be
so
so
johnny
eastman
you
want
the
yourself
you
know
you
do
said
johnny
you
want
everything
you
see
and
if
folks
do
give
right
up
to
you
then
there
a
fuss
o
johnny
eastman
i
a
girl
and
that
the
only
reason
why
i
want
the
if
i
was
a
boy
do
you
i
touch
such
a
thing
but
i
ca
wear
flowers
in
the
of
my
coat
now
can
i
the
children
were
in
the
guest
chamber
preparing
to
go
down
all
but
prudy
who
was
in
her
mother
room
assisting
at
the
bridal
toilet
susy
and
flossy
stood
before
the
mirror
and
johnny
and
dotty
in
the
middle
of
the
room
confronting
each
other
with
angry
brows
illustration
dotty
wants
the
hush
children
said
susy
in
an
absentminded
way
and
went
on
brushing
her
hair
which
was
one
of
the
greatest
trials
in
the
whole
world
because
it
would
not
curl
she
had
frizzed
it
with
rolled
it
on
papers
and
drenched
it
with
soap
suds
till
there
was
danger
of
its
fading
entirely
away
still
it
was
as
straight
after
all
as
an
indian
o
dear
said
she
it
sticks
up
all
over
my
head
like
a
skein
of
yarn
children
do
hush
mine
curls
too
tight
if
anything
do
you
think
so
asked
flossy
trying
not
to
look
as
well
satisfied
with
herself
as
she
really
felt
adding
by
way
of
parenthesis
johnny
why
ca
you
be
quiet
are
you
going
to
let
me
have
that
johnny
eastman
continued
dotty
i
going
right
out
to
tell
my
mother
be
so
mortified
she
send
you
right
home
if
you
hold
it
up
to
your
nose
when
you
are
nothing
but
a
boy
that
right
dimple
run
and
tell
no
i
sha
tell
if
you
give
it
to
me
and
you
may
have
one
of
the
roses
in
your
johnny
that
the
way
the
pickings
man
had
that
wrote
little
nell
father
said
so
there
a
good
boy
now
dotty
dropped
her
voice
to
a
milder
key
and
smiled
as
sweetly
as
the
bitterness
of
her
feelings
would
permit
she
had
set
her
heart
on
the
toy
and
her
white
slippers
and
even
her
gold
necklace
dwindled
into
nothing
in
comparison
whose
mother
owns
this
i
like
to
know
said
johnny
flourishing
it
above
his
head
and
whose
father
brought
home
the
flowers
from
the
well
any
way
johnny
was
my
aunt
and
uncle
you
know
and
they
be
willing
your
mamma
let
me
have
her
necklace
my
asking
i
ca
help
it
if
they
both
as
willing
as
two
peas
cried
johnny
i
not
willing
myself
and
that
enough
o
what
a
boy
i
was
going
to
put
some
of
my
nightly
blue
sirreup
on
your
hangerjif
and
now
i
wo
see
if
i
do
i
do
want
anybody
sirup
retorted
johnny
such
a
cross
party
as
you
are
johnny
eastman
you
just
stop
murdering
me
murdering
you
yes
that
hateth
his
brother
i
not
your
brother
i
should
hope
well
a
cousin
just
as
bad
no
not
half
so
bad
i
would
be
your
brother
if
i
had
to
be
a
beggar
and
i
would
let
you
be
a
brother
johnny
eastman
not
if
i
had
to
go
and
be
a
heathen
o
what
a
dotty
o
what
a
johnny
by
this
time
the
little
bridesmaid
face
was
anything
but
pleasant
to
behold
both
her
dimples
were
buried
out
of
sight
and
she
had
as
many
wrinkles
in
her
forehead
as
grandma
head
johnny
danced
about
the
room
holding
before
her
eyes
the
bone
of
contention
then
drawing
it
away
again
in
the
most
provoking
manner
if
you
act
so
johnny
eastman
i
wo
have
you
for
my
bridegroom
and
i
wo
have
you
for
my
bride
so
there
the
moment
these
words
were
spoken
the
angry
children
were
frightened
they
had
not
intended
to
go
so
far
it
had
been
their
greatest
pleasure
for
several
weeks
to
think
of
standing
up
at
a
wedding
and
they
would
neither
of
them
have
missed
the
honor
on
any
account
but
now
in
their
foolish
strife
they
had
made
it
impossible
to
do
the
very
thing
they
most
desired
to
do
they
had
said
the
fatal
words
and
were
both
of
them
too
proud
to
draw
back
there
was
one
comfort
the
wedding
will
be
stopped
thought
dotty
they
ca
be
married
johnny
and
me
the
guests
were
all
assembled
it
was
now
time
for
the
bridal
train
to
go
down
stairs
and
have
the
ceremony
performed
as
the
children
left
the
chamber
uncertain
what
to
do
but
resolved
that
whichever
stood
up
the
other
would
sit
down
johnny
seized
a
bottle
of
panacea
which
stood
on
the
mantel
and
wet
the
corner
of
dotty
handkerchief
there
is
some
sirup
worth
having
said
he
stronger
than
yours
rub
it
in
your
eyes
and
see
if
it
is
the
boy
did
not
mean
what
he
said
or
at
any
rate
we
will
hope
he
did
not
but
dotty
in
her
haste
and
agitation
obeyed
him
without
stopping
one
moment
to
think
instantly
the
wedding
was
forgotten
the
the
anger
the
disappointment
and
everything
else
but
the
agony
in
her
eyes
it
was
so
dreadful
that
she
could
only
scream
and
spin
round
and
round
like
a
top
a
scene
of
confusion
followed
the
poor
child
was
so
frantic
that
her
father
was
obliged
to
hold
her
by
main
force
while
her
mother
tried
to
bathe
her
eyes
with
cold
water
they
were
fearfully
inflamed
and
for
a
whole
hour
the
wedding
was
delayed
while
poor
dotty
lay
struggling
in
her
father
arms
or
tore
about
the
nursery
like
a
wild
creature
johnny
was
very
sorry
he
said
he
did
not
know
what
was
in
the
bottle
he
had
sprinkled
his
cousin
handkerchief
in
sport
she
talks
so
much
about
her
blue
sirreup
said
he
to
his
mother
that
i
thought
i
would
tease
her
a
little
speck
i
do
know
but
you
have
put
her
eyes
out
said
his
mother
severely
o
do
you
think
so
wailed
johnny
o
do
say
so
mother
i
hope
not
my
child
but
panacea
is
a
very
powerful
thing
i
do
know
precisely
what
is
in
it
but
you
have
certainly
tried
a
dangerous
experiment
i
did
mean
to
mother
i
never
do
so
again
that
is
what
you
always
say
replied
his
mother
shaking
her
head
and
that
is
why
i
am
so
discouraged
about
you
nothing
seems
to
make
any
impression
upon
you
if
you
have
really
made
your
cousin
blind
for
life
i
hope
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
while
eastman
talked
looking
very
stately
in
her
velvet
dress
master
johnny
was
balancing
himself
on
the
in
the
hall
as
if
he
scarcely
heard
what
she
said
but
in
spite
of
his
disrespectful
manner
he
was
really
unhappy
i
knew
something
would
go
wrong
continued
eastman
when
it
was
first
proposed
that
you
and
dotty
should
stand
up
together
and
i
did
not
approve
of
the
plan
what
is
the
reason
you
two
children
must
always
be
quarrelling
she
is
the
one
that
begins
it
replied
johnny
if
i
could
have
stood
up
with
prudy
there
would
have
been
any
fuss
with
prudy
indeed
i
dare
say
you
would
be
glad
to
do
so
now
you
naughty
boy
your
kind
aunt
mary
suggested
it
but
i
told
her
no
since
you
have
hurt
dotty
so
terribly
you
can
not
be
groomsman
o
mother
no
my
son
she
is
unable
to
perform
her
part
and
you
must
give
up
yours
percy
will
take
your
place
in
spite
of
his
manliness
johnny
dropped
a
few
tears
which
he
brushed
away
with
the
back
of
his
hand
but
his
mother
for
once
in
her
life
was
firm
i
will
not
say
that
johnny
disappointment
was
not
some
consolation
to
dotty
who
lay
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlor
with
her
eyes
bandaged
while
the
wedding
ceremony
was
performed
if
johnny
had
been
one
of
the
group
while
her
own
poor
little
self
was
left
out
necklace
slippers
and
all
she
would
have
thought
it
unjust
as
it
was
it
seemed
hard
enough
she
was
in
total
darkness
but
her
mind
made
pictures
while
her
eyes
were
shut
she
could
almost
see
how
the
bride
and
bridegroom
looked
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
with
the
tall
percy
on
one
side
and
the
short
prudy
on
the
other
the
dear
prudy
who
was
so
sorry
for
her
sister
that
she
could
not
enjoy
taking
her
place
though
a
fairer
little
bridesmaid
than
she
made
could
hardly
be
found
in
the
city
the
same
clergyman
officiated
now
who
had
married
and
parlin
fifteen
years
before
and
after
he
had
married
them
over
again
he
made
a
speech
which
caused
dotty
to
cry
a
little
under
her
handkerchief
or
if
not
the
speech
it
was
the
panacea
that
brought
the
tears
she
did
not
know
which
he
said
he
remembered
just
how
edward
parlin
and
mary
read
looked
when
they
stood
before
him
in
the
bloom
of
their
youth
and
promised
to
live
together
as
husband
and
wife
they
had
seemed
very
happy
then
but
he
thought
they
were
happier
now
he
could
read
in
their
faces
the
history
of
fifteen
beautiful
years
he
did
not
wonder
the
time
had
passed
very
pleasantly
for
they
knew
how
to
make
each
other
happy
they
had
tried
to
do
right
and
they
had
three
lovely
children
who
were
blessings
to
them
and
would
be
blessings
to
any
parents
it
was
here
that
dotty
felt
the
tears
start
i
not
a
blessing
at
all
thought
she
he
does
know
anything
about
it
how
i
act
and
had
temper
up
stairs
with
johnny
johnny
put
my
eyes
out
for
it
and
i
have
to
go
to
the
i
suppose
if
i
do
i
sha
be
a
blessing
so
much
as
i
am
now
to
anybody
ever
by
and
by
aunt
eastman
presented
the
bride
with
a
bridal
rose
which
looked
as
nearly
as
possible
like
the
one
she
had
given
her
at
the
first
wedding
and
which
grew
from
a
slip
of
the
same
plant
dotty
could
not
see
the
rose
but
she
heard
her
aunt
say
she
hoped
to
attend
parlin
golden
wedding
i
shall
be
ever
so
old
by
that
time
thought
the
little
girl
fifteen
from
fifty
leaves
leaves
i
do
know
what
it
leaves
but
i
shall
be
a
blind
old
lady
and
wear
a
cap
perhaps
god
wants
to
make
a
very
good
woman
of
me
same
as
emily
and
that
why
he
let
johnny
put
my
eyes
out
here
some
one
came
along
and
offered
miss
dimple
a
slice
of
wedding
cake
which
tasted
just
as
delicious
as
if
she
could
see
it
then
some
one
else
put
a
glass
of
lemonade
to
her
lips
has
my
little
girl
a
kiss
for
me
said
parlin
coming
to
the
sofa
as
soon
as
she
could
break
away
from
her
guests
the
gentle
went
to
dotty
heart
she
threw
her
arms
about
parlin
neck
wrinkling
her
collar
and
tumbling
her
veil
take
care
my
child
said
parlin
laughing
do
not
crush
the
bride
everybody
has
been
coming
up
to
salute
her
and
you
must
understand
that
she
does
you
a
great
honor
to
go
to
you
and
a
kiss
it
is
just
like
you
though
mamma
you
are
so
good
to
me
and
so
is
everybody
no
matter
how
naughty
i
am
and
spoil
weddings
they
say
hateful
thing
would
it
make
you
a
better
child
do
you
think
dotty
to
be
scolded
when
you
do
wrong
why
no
indeed
mamma
it
all
that
makes
me
be
the
wickedest
girl
in
this
city
is
you
are
so
good
to
me
i
know
it
is
parlin
kissed
the
little
mouth
that
said
these
sweet
words
and
now
that
i
am
blind
mamma
you
are
so
kind
i
you
feed
me
with
a
spoon
you
will
surely
be
taken
care
of
dear
as
long
as
your
eyes
are
in
this
state
but
sha
i
be
always
blind
no
indeed
child
you
will
be
quite
well
in
a
day
or
two
o
i
so
glad
mamma
i
was
thinking
i
should
ever
go
to
school
and
should
have
to
be
sent
to
the
while
dotty
was
speaking
johnny
came
up
to
the
sofa
and
taking
her
hand
said
in
a
tone
of
real
sorrow
look
here
dotty
i
was
a
naughty
boy
will
you
forgive
me
as
johnny
was
not
in
the
habit
of
begging
pardon
and
did
it
now
of
his
own
free
will
dotty
was
greatly
astonished
yes
johnny
said
she
i
forgive
you
all
up
but
then
i
do
ever
want
you
to
put
my
eyes
out
again
i
wo
now
honest
see
i
do
replied
master
johnny
in
a
choked
voice
and
you
may
have
that
to
keep
mother
said
so
o
johnny
yes
mother
says
we
can
call
it
a
offering
let
not
quarrel
any
more
dotty
just
to
see
how
seem
what
never
exclaimed
dotty
starting
up
on
her
elbow
and
trying
to
look
through
her
thick
bandage
at
johnny
never
why
do
you
mean
to
come
to
my
house
any
more
johnny
eastman
yes
but
i
wo
quarrel
unless
you
begin
it
o
sha
begin
it
replied
miss
dimple
confidently
i
never
do
you
know
johnny
had
the
grace
not
to
retort
he
was
ashamed
of
his
ungentlemanly
conduct
and
knelt
before
the
sofa
gazing
sadly
at
his
blindfolded
little
cousin
it
was
a
humble
place
for
him
and
we
will
leave
him
there
hoping
his
penitence
may
do
him
good
for
the
future
as
for
miss
dimple
we
will
bid
her
goodbye
while
her
eyes
are
closed
be
patient
little
dotty
the
pain
will
soon
be
over
and
when
we
see
you
again
you
will
be
trudging
merrily
to
school
with
a
book
under
your
arm
