is
all
our
life
then
but
a
dream
seen
faintly
in
the
golden
gleam
athwart
dark
resistless
stream
bowed
to
the
earth
with
bitter
woe
or
laughing
at
some
we
flutter
idly
to

fro
little
day
in
haste
we

its
merry

the
silent

preface
one
little
picture
in
this
book
the
magic
locket
at
was
drawn
by
alice
i
did
not
state
this
on
the
since
it
seemed
only
due
to
the
artist
of
all
these
to
my
mind
pictures
that
his
name
should
stand
there
alone
the
descriptions
at
pp
of
sunday
as
spent
by
children
of
the
last
generation
are
quoted
from
a
speech
made
to
me
by
a
and
a
letter
written
to
me
by
a
the
chapters
headed
and
revenge
are
a
reprint
with
a
few
alterations
of
a
little
which
i
wrote
in
the
year
at
the
request
of
the
late
gatty
for
magazine
which
she
was
then
editing
it
was
in
i
believe
that
the
idea
first
occurred
to
me
of
making
it
the
nucleus
of
a
longer
story
as
the
years
went
on
i
jotted
down
at
odd
moments
all
sorts
of
odd
ideas
and
fragments
of
dialogue
that
occurred
to
knows
how
a
transitory
suddenness
that
left
me
no
choice
but
either
to
record
them
then
and
there
or
to
abandon
them
to
oblivion
sometimes
one
could
trace
to
their
source
these
random
flashes
of
being
suggested
by
the
book
one
was
reading
or
struck
out
from
the
of
own
mind
by
the
of
a
chance
they
had
also
a
way
of
their
own
of
occurring
of
of
that
hopelessly
illogical
phenomenon
effect
without
a
such
for
example
was
the
last
line
of
hunting
of
the
snark
which
came
into
my
head
as
i
have
already
related
in
for
april
quite
suddenly
during
a
solitary
walk
and
such
again
have
been
passages
which
occurred
in
and
which
i
can
not
trace
to
any
antecedent
cause
whatever
there
are
at
least
instances
of
such
in
this
my
remark
often
runs
in
families
just
as
a
love
for
pastry
at
the
other
eric
about
having
been
in
domestic
service
at
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
i
found
myself
at
last
in
possession
of
a
huge
unwieldy
mass
of
the
reader
will
kindly
excuse
the
only
needed
stringing
together
upon
the
thread
of
a
consecutive
story
to
constitute
the
book
i
hoped
to
write
only
the
task
at
first
seemed
absolutely
hopeless
and
gave
me
a
far
clearer
idea
than
i
ever
had
before
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
i
think
it
must
have
been
ten
years
or
more
before
i
had
succeeded
in
classifying
these
sufficiently
to
see
what
sort
of
a
story
they
indicated
for
the
story
had
to
grow
out
of
the
incidents
not
the
incidents
out
of
the
story
i
am
telling
all
this
in
no
spirit
of
egoism
but
because
i
really
believe
that
some
of
my
readers
will
be
interested
in
these
details
of
the
of
a
book
which
looks
so
simple
and
a
matter
when
completed
that
they
might
suppose
it
to
have
been
written
straight
off
page
by
page
as
one
would
write
a
letter
beginning
at
the
beginning
and
ending
at
the
end
it
is
no
doubt
to
write
a
story
in
that
way
and
if
it
be
not
vanity
to
say
so
i
believe
that
i
could
myself
i
were
in
the
unfortunate
position
for
i
do
hold
it
to
be
a
real
misfortune
of
being
obliged
to
produce
a
given
amount
of
fiction
in
a
given
time
i
could
my
task
and
produce
my
of
bricks
as
other
slaves
have
done
one
thing
at
any
rate
i
could
guarantee
as
to
the
story
so
it
should
be
utterly
commonplace
should
contain
no
new
ideas
whatever
and
should
be
very
very
weary
reading
this
species
of
literature
has
received
the
very
appropriate
name
of
might
fitly
be
defined
as
which
all
can
write
and
none
can
that
the
present
volume
contains
such
writing
i
dare
not
avow
sometimes
in
order
to
bring
a
picture
into
its
proper
place
it
has
been
necessary
to
eke
out
a
page
with
two
or
three
extra
lines
but
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
put
in
no
more
than
i
was
absolutely
compelled
to
do
my
readers
may
perhaps
like
to
amuse
themselves
by
trying
to
detect
in
a
given
passage
the
one
piece
of
it
contains
while
arranging
the
into
pages
i
found
that
the
passage
which
now
extends
from
the
top
of
to
the
middle
of
was
lines
too
short
i
supplied
the
deficiency
not
by
interpolating
a
word
here
and
a
word
there
but
by
writing
in
consecutive
lines
now
can
my
readers
guess
they
are
a
harder
a
harder
be
be
to
determine
as
to
the
song
in
cases
if
any
the
stanza
was
adapted
to
the
surrounding
text
and
in
if
any
the
text
was
adapted
to
the
stanza
perhaps
the
hardest
thing
in
all
least
have
found
it
so
by
no
voluntary
effort
can
i
accomplish
it
i
have
to
take
it
as
it
to
write
anything
and
perhaps
the
easiest
is
when
once
an
original
line
has
been
struck
out
to
follow
it
up
and
to
write
any
amount
more
to
the
same
tune
i
do
not
know
if
in
was
an
was
at
least
no
imitator
in
writing
i
do
know
that
since
it
came
out
something
like
a
dozen
have
appeared
on
identically
the
same
pattern
the
path
i
timidly
myself
to
be
first
that
ever
burst
into
that
silent
now
a
beaten
all
the
flowers
have
long
ago
been
trampled
into
the
dust
and
it
would
be
courting
disaster
for
me
to
attempt
that
style
again
hence
it
is
that
in
and
bruno
i
have
i
know
not
what
strike
out
yet
another
new
path
be
it
bad
or
good
it
is
the
best
i
can
do
it
is
written
not
for
money
and
not
for
fame
but
in
the
hope
of
supplying
for
the
children
whom
i
love
some
thoughts
that
may
suit
those
hours
of
innocent
merriment
which
are
the
very
life
of
childhood
and
also
in
the
hope
of
suggesting
to
them
and
to
others
some
thoughts
that
may
prove
i
would
fain
hope
not
wholly
out
of
harmony
with
the
graver
cadences
of
life
if
i
have
not
already
exhausted
the
patience
of
my
readers
i
would
like
to
seize
this
the
last
i
shall
have
of
addressing
so
many
friends
at
putting
on
record
some
ideas
that
have
occurred
to
me
as
to
books
desirable
to
be
i
should
much
like
to
but
may
not
ever
have
the
time
or
power
to
carry
the
hope
that
if
should
fail
and
the
years
are
gliding
away
fast
to
finish
the
task
i
have
set
myself
other
hands
may
take
it
up
first
a
bible
the
only
real
of
this
would
be
carefully
selected
passages
suitable
for
a
reading
and
pictures
one
principle
of
selection
which
i
would
adopt
would
be
that
religion
should
be
put
before
a
child
as
a
revelation
of
need
to
pain
and
puzzle
the
young
mind
with
the
history
of
crime
and
punishment
on
such
a
principle
i
should
for
example
omit
the
history
of
the
flood
the
supplying
of
the
pictures
would
involve
no
great
difficulty
no
new
ones
would
be
needed
hundreds
of
excellent
pictures
already
exist
the
copyright
of
which
has
long
ago
expired
and
which
simply
need
or
some
similar
process
for
their
successful
reproduction
the
book
should
be
handy
in
a
pretty
a
clear
legible
above
all
with
abundance
of
pictures
pictures
pictures
secondly
a
book
of
pieces
selected
from
the
single
texts
but
passages
of
from
to
verses
be
committed
to
memory
such
passages
would
be
found
useful
to
repeat
to
and
to
ponder
over
on
many
occasions
when
reading
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
instance
when
lying
awake
at
a
taking
a
solitary
old
age
when
is
failing
or
wholly
best
of
all
when
illness
while
incapacitating
us
for
reading
or
any
other
occupation
condemns
us
to
lie
awake
through
many
weary
silent
hours
at
such
a
time
how
keenly
one
may
realise
the
truth
of
rapturous
cry
how
sweet
are
thy
words
unto
my
throat
yea
sweeter
than
honey
unto
my
mouth
i
have
said
rather
than
single
texts
because
we
have
no
means
of
single
texts
memory
needs
and
here
are
none
one
may
have
a
hundred
texts
stored
in
the
memory
and
not
be
able
to
recall
at
will
more
than
those
by
mere
chance
whereas
once
get
hold
of
any
portion
of
a
that
has
been
committed
to
memory
and
the
whole
can
be
recovered
all
hangs
together
thirdly
a
collection
of
passages
both
prose
and
verse
from
books
other
than
the
bible
there
is
not
perhaps
much
in
what
is
called
literature
a
misnomer
i
hold
if
shakespeare
was
not
inspired
one
may
well
doubt
if
any
man
ever
was
that
will
bear
the
process
of
being
pondered
over
a
hundred
times
still
there
such
i
think
to
make
a
goodly
store
for
the
memory
these
two
sacred
and
secular
passages
for
serve
other
good
purposes
besides
merely
occupying
vacant
hours
they
will
help
to
keep
at
bay
many
anxious
thoughts
worrying
thoughts
uncharitable
thoughts
unholy
thoughts
let
me
say
this
in
better
words
than
my
own
by
copying
a
passage
from
that
most
interesting
book
lectures
on
the
epistles
to
the
corinthians
lecture
xlix
a
man
finds
himself
haunted
by
evil
desires
and
unholy
images
which
will
generally
be
at
periodical
hours
let
him
commit
to
memory
passages
of
scripture
or
passages
from
the
best
writers
in
verse
or
prose
let
him
store
his
mind
with
these
as
to
repeat
when
he
lies
awake
in
some
restless
night
or
when
despairing
imaginations
or
gloomy
suicidal
thoughts
beset
him
let
these
be
to
him
the
sword
turning
everywhere
to
keep
the
way
of
the
garden
of
life
from
the
intrusion
of
profaner
fourthly
a
for
girls
that
is
an
edition
in
which
everything
not
suitable
for
the
perusal
of
girls
of
say
from
to
should
be
omitted
few
children
under
would
be
likely
to
understand
or
enjoy
the
greatest
of
poets
and
those
who
have
passed
out
of
girlhood
may
safely
be
left
to
read
shakespeare
in
any
edition
or
not
that
they
may
prefer
but
it
seems
a
pity
that
so
many
children
in
the
intermediate
stage
should
be
debarred
from
a
great
pleasure
for
want
of
an
edition
suitable
to
them
neither
nor
shakespeare
seems
to
me
to
meet
the
want
they
are
not
sufficiently
is
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
looking
through
it
i
am
filled
with
a
deep
sense
of
wonder
considering
what
he
has
left
in
that
he
should
have
cut
out
besides
relentlessly
erasing
all
that
is
unsuitable
on
the
score
of
reverence
or
decency
i
should
be
inclined
to
omit
also
all
that
seems
too
difficult
or
not
likely
to
interest
young
readers
the
resulting
book
might
be
slightly
fragmentary
but
it
would
be
a
real
treasure
to
all
british
maidens
who
have
any
taste
for
poetry
if
it
be
needful
to
apologize
to
any
one
for
the
new
departure
i
have
taken
in
this
introducing
along
with
what
will
i
hope
prove
to
be
acceptable
nonsense
for
children
some
of
the
graver
thoughts
of
human
must
be
to
one
who
has
learned
the
art
of
keeping
such
thoughts
wholly
at
a
distance
in
hours
of
mirth
and
careless
ease
to
him
such
a
mixture
will
seem
no
doubt
and
repulsive
and
that
such
an
art
i
do
not
dispute
with
youth
good
health
and
sufficient
money
it
seems
quite
possible
to
lead
for
years
together
a
life
of
unmixed
the
exception
of
one
solemn
fact
with
which
we
are
liable
to
be
confronted
at
moment
even
in
the
midst
of
the
most
brilliant
company
or
the
most
sparkling
entertainment
a
man
may
fix
his
own
times
for
admitting
serious
thought
for
attending
public
worship
for
prayer
for
reading
the
bible
all
such
matters
he
can
defer
to
that
which
is
so
apt
never
to
occur
at
all
but
he
can
not
defer
for
one
single
moment
the
necessity
of
attending
to
a
message
which
may
come
before
he
has
finished
reading
this
page
night
shall
thy
soul
be
required
of
the
sense
of
this
grim
possibility
has
been
in
all
ages
an
incubus
that
men
have
striven
to
shake
off
few
more
interesting
subjects
of
enquiry
could
be
found
by
a
student
of
history
than
the
various
weapons
that
have
been
used
against
this
shadowy
foe
saddest
of
all
must
have
been
the
thoughts
of
those
who
saw
indeed
an
beyond
the
grave
but
an
existence
far
more
terrible
than
existence
as
filmy
impalpable
all
but
invisible
spectres
drifting
about
through
endless
ages
in
a
world
of
shadows
with
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
hope
for
nothing
to
love
in
the
midst
of
the
gay
verses
of
that
genial
horace
there
stands
one
dreary
word
whose
utter
sadness
goes
to
heart
it
is
the
word
in
the
passage
omnes
eodem
cogimur
omnium
versatur
urnâ
serius
ocius
sors
exitura
et
nos
in
æternum
exilium
impositura
cymbæ
yes
to
him
this
present
of
all
its
weariness
and
all
its
the
only
life
worth
having
all
else
was
does
it
not
seem
almost
incredible
that
one
holding
such
a
creed
should
ever
have
smiled
and
many
in
this
day
i
fear
even
though
believing
in
an
existence
beyond
the
grave
far
more
real
than
horace
ever
dreamed
of
yet
regard
it
as
a
sort
of
from
all
the
joys
of
life
and
so
adopt
theory
and
say
us
eat
and
drink
for
we
we
go
to
entertainments
such
as
the
say
for
also
go
to
the
play
whenever
i
get
a
chance
of
seeing
a
really
good
keep
at
length
if
possible
the
thought
that
we
may
not
return
alive
yet
how
do
you
friend
whose
patience
has
carried
you
through
this
garrulous
it
may
not
be
lot
when
mirth
is
fastest
and
most
furious
to
feel
the
sharp
pang
or
the
deadly
faintness
which
heralds
the
final
see
with
vague
wonder
anxious
friends
bending
over
hear
their
troubled
yourself
to
shape
the
question
with
trembling
lips
it
serious
and
to
be
told
the
end
is
and
oh
how
different
all
life
will
look
when
those
words
are
said
do
you
know
i
say
that
all
this
may
not
happen
to
this
night
and
you
knowing
this
say
to
yourself
perhaps
it
an
immoral
play
perhaps
the
situations
a
little
too
the
dialogue
a
little
too
strong
the
a
little
too
suggestive
i
say
that
conscience
is
easy
but
the
piece
is
so
clever
i
must
see
it
this
once
begin
a
stricter
life
and
and
sins
in
hope
who
sinning
says
for
sin
judgement
stays
against
spirit
he
lies
quite
stops
mercy
with
insult
dares
and
drops
like
a
fly
that
spins
in
vain
upon
the
axis
of
its
pain
then
takes
its
doom
to
limp
and
crawl
blind
and
forgot
from
fall
to
let
me
pause
for
a
moment
to
say
that
i
believe
this
thought
of
the
possibility
of
calmly
realised
and
steadily
be
one
of
the
best
possible
tests
as
to
our
going
to
any
scene
of
amusement
being
right
or
wrong
if
the
thought
of
sudden
death
acquires
for
a
special
horror
when
imagined
as
happening
in
a
then
be
very
sure
the
theatre
is
harmful
for
however
harmless
it
may
be
for
others
and
that
are
incurring
a
deadly
peril
in
going
be
sure
the
safest
rule
is
that
we
should
not
dare
to
in
any
scene
in
which
we
dare
not
but
once
realise
what
the
true

not

one
other
matter
may
perhaps
seem
to
call
for
i
should
have
treated
with
such
entire
want
of
sympathy
the
british
passion
for
which
no
doubt
has
been
in
days
and
is
still
in
some
forms
of
it
an
excellent
school
for
hardihood
and
for
coolness
in
moments
of
danger
but
i
am
not
entirely
without
sympathy
for
i
can
heartily
admire
the
courage
of
the
man
who
with
severe
bodily
toil
and
at
the
risk
of
his
life
hunts
down
some
tiger
and
i
can
heartily
sympathize
with
him
when
he
exults
in
the
glorious
excitement
of
the
chase
and
the
struggle
with
the
monster
brought
to
bay
but
i
can
but
look
with
deep
wonder
and
sorrow
on
the
hunter
who
at
his
ease
and
in
safety
can
find
pleasure
in
what
involves
for
some
defenceless
creature
wild
terror
and
a
death
of
agony
deeper
if
the
hunter
be
one
who
has
pledged
himself
to
preach
to
men
the
religion
of
universal
love
deepest
of
all
if
it
be
one
of
those
and
beings
whose
very
name
serves
as
a

then
all
the
people
cheered
again
and
one
man
who
was
more
excited
than
the
rest
flung
his
hat
high
into
the
air
and
shouted
as
well
as
i
could
make
out
roar
for
the
roared
but
whether
it
was
for
the
or
not
did
not
clearly
appear
some
were
shouting
and
some
but
no
one
seemed
to
know
what
it
was
they
really
wanted
all
this
i
saw
from
the
open
window
of
the
looking
across
the
shoulder
of
the
lord
chancellor
who
had
sprung
to
his
feet
the
moment
the
shouting
began
almost
as
if
he
had
been
expecting
it
and
had
rushed
to
the
window
which
commanded
the
best
view
of
the
it
all
mean
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
as
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
his
gown
floating
in
the
air
he
paced
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
never
heard
such
shouting
at
this
time
of
the
morning
too
and
with
such
unanimity
it
strike
as
very
remarkable
i
represented
modestly
that
to
ears
it
appeared
that
they
were
shouting
for
different
things
but
the
chancellor
would
not
listen
to
my
suggestion
for
a
moment
all
shout
the
same
words
i
assure
you
he
said
then
leaning
well
out
of
the
window
he
whispered
to
a
man
who
was
standing
close
underneath
together
you
the
warden
will
be
here
directly
give
the
signal
for
the
march
up
all
this
was
evidently
not
meant
for
ears
but
i
could
scarcely
help
hearing
it
considering
that
my
chin
was
almost
on
the
shoulder
illustration
the
the
was
a
very
curious
sight
a
straggling
procession
of
men
marching
two
and
two
began
from
the
other
side
of
the
and
advanced
in
an
irregular
fashion
towards
the
palace
wildly
tacking
from
side
to
side
like
a
sailing
vessel
making
way
against
an
unfavourable
that
the
head
of
the
procession
was
often
further
from
us
at
the
end
of
one
tack
than
it
had
been
at
the
end
of
the
previous
one
yet
it
was
evident
that
all
was
being
done
under
orders
for
i
noticed
that
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
man
who
stood
just
under
the
window
and
to
whom
the
chancellor
was
continually
whispering
this
man
held
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
little
green
flag
in
the
other
whenever
he
waved
the
flag
the
procession
advanced
a
little
nearer
when
he
dipped
it
they
sidled
a
little
farther
off
and
whenever
he
waved
his
hat
they
all
raised
a
hoarse
cheer
they
cried
carefully
keeping
time
with
the
hat
as
it
bobbed
up
and
down
noo
consti
tooshun
less
bread
more

do
do
the
chancellor
whispered
rest
a
bit
till
i
give
you
the
word
not
here
yet
but
at
this
moment
the
great
of
the
saloon
were
flung
open
and
he
turned
with
a
guilty
start
to
receive
his
high
excellency
however
it
was
only
bruno
and
the
chancellor
gave
a
little
gasp
of
relieved
anxiety
said
the
little
fellow
addressing
the
remark
in
a
general
sort
of
way
to
the
chancellor
and
the
waiters
oo
know
where
sylvie
is
looking
for
sylvie
with
the
warden
i
believe
the
chancellor
replied
with
a
low
bow
there
was
no
doubt
a
certain
amount
of
absurdity
in
applying
this
title
which
as
of
course
you
see
without
my
telling
you
was
nothing
but
royal
condensed
into
one
syllable
to
a
small
creature
whose
father
was
merely
the
warden
of
outland
still
large
excuse
must
be
made
for
a
man
who
had
passed
several
years
at
the
court
of
fairyland
and
had
there
acquired
the
almost
impossible
art
of
pronouncing
five
syllables
as
one
but
the
bow
was
lost
upon
bruno
who
had
run
out
of
the
room
even
while
the
great
feat
of
the
unpronounceable
monosyllable
was
being
triumphantly
performed
just
then
a
single
voice
in
the
distance
was
understood
to
shout
speech
from
the
chancellor
my
friends
the
chancellor
replied
with
extraordinary
promptitude
shall
have
a
speech
here
one
of
the
waiters
who
had
been
for
some
minutes
busy
making
a
mixture
of
egg
and
sherry
respectfully
presented
it
on
a
large
silver
salver
the
chancellor
took
it
haughtily
drank
it
off
thoughtfully
smiled
benevolently
on
the
happy
waiter
as
he
set
down
the
empty
glass
and
began
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
this
is
what
he
said
ahem
ahem
or
rather
suffering
call
names
muttered
the
man
under
the
window
say
the
chancellor
explained
may
be
sure
that
i
always
shouted
the
crowd
so
loudly
as
quite
to
drown
the
thin
squeaky
voice
i
always
he
repeated
simper
quite
so
much
said
the
man
under
the
window
makes
yer
look
a
hidiot
and
all
this
time
went
rumbling
round
the
like
a
peal
of
thunder
i
always
yelled
the
chancellor
the
first
moment
there
was
silence
your
friend
is
the
day
and
night
he
is
brooding
on
your
should
say
your
is
to
say
your
i
mean
your
talk
no
more
growled
the
man
under
the
window
making
a
mess
of
it
at
this
moment
the
entered
the
saloon
he
was
a
thin
man
with
a
mean
and
crafty
face
and
a
complexion
and
he
crossed
the
room
very
slowly
looking
suspiciously
about
him
as
if
he
thought
there
might
be
a
savage
dog
hidden
somewhere
he
cried
patting
the
chancellor
on
the
back
did
that
speech
very
well
indeed
why
a
born
orator
man
nothing
the
chancellor
replied
modestly
with
downcast
eyes
orators
are
you
the
thoughtfully
rubbed
his
chin
so
they
are
he
admitted
never
considered
it
in
that
light
still
you
did
it
very
well
a
word
in
your
ear
the
rest
of
their
conversation
was
all
in
whispers
so
as
i
could
hear
no
more
i
thought
i
would
go
and
find
bruno
i
found
the
little
fellow
standing
in
the
passage
and
being
addressed
by
one
of
the
men
in
livery
who
stood
before
him
nearly
bent
double
from
extreme
respectfulness
with
his
hands
hanging
in
front
of
him
like
the
fins
of
a
fish
high
excellency
this
respectful
man
was
saying
in
his
study
he
pronounce
this
quite
so
well
as
the
chancellor
thither
bruno
trotted
and
i
thought
it
well
to
follow
him
the
warden
a
tall
dignified
man
with
a
grave
but
very
pleasant
face
was
seated
before
a
which
was
covered
with
papers
and
holding
on
his
knee
one
of
the
sweetest
and
loveliest
little
maidens
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
see
she
looked
four
or
five
years
older
than
bruno
but
she
had
the
same
rosy
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
and
the
same
wealth
of
curly
brown
hair
her
eager
smiling
face
was
turned
upwards
towards
her
and
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
mutual
love
with
which
the
two
in
the
spring
of
life
the
other
in
its
late
gazing
on
each
other
never
seen
him
the
old
man
was
saying
you
know
been
away
so
from
land
to
land
and
seeking
for
health
more
years
than
been
alive
little
sylvie
here
bruno
climbed
upon
his
other
knee
and
a
good
deal
of
kissing
on
a
rather
complicated
system
was
the
result
only
came
back
last
night
said
the
warden
when
the
kissing
was
over
been
traveling
for
the
last
thousand
miles
or
so
in
order
to
be
here
on
birthday
but
a
very
early
riser
and
i
dare
say
in
the
library
already
come
with
me
and
see
him
always
kind
to
children
be
sure
to
like
the
other
professor
come
too
bruno
asked
in
an
voice
they
arrived
together
the
other
professor
you
like
him
quite
so
much
perhaps
a
little
more
you
wiss
was
a
little
more
dreamy
said
bruno
you
mean
bruno
said
sylvie
bruno
went
on
addressing
his
father
says
she
oo
know
but
i
thinks
it
she
dream
the
puzzled
warden
repeated
say
it
bruno
persisted
i
says
to
her
stop
lessons
she
says
i
of
letting
oo
stop
yet
always
wants
to
stop
lessons
sylvie
explained
minutes
after
we
begin
lessons
a
day
said
the
warden
learn
much
at
rate
little
man
just
what
sylvie
says
bruno
rejoined
says
i
learn
my
lessons
and
i
tells
her
over
and
over
i
learn
and
what
doos
oo
think
she
says
she
says
go
and
see
the
professor
the
warden
said
wisely
avoiding
further
discussion
the
children
got
down
off
his
knees
each
secured
a
hand
and
the
happy
trio
set
off
for
the
by
me
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
by
this
time
that
none
of
the
party
except
for
a
few
moments
the
lord
chancellor
was
in
the
least
able
to
see
me
the
matter
with
him
sylvie
asked
walking
with
a
little
extra
sedateness
by
way
of
example
to
bruno
at
the
other
side
who
never
ceased
jumping
up
and
down
illustration
visiting
the
professor
the
i
hope
all
right
lumbago
and
rheumatism
and
that
kind
of
thing
been
curing
you
know
a
very
learned
doctor
why
actually
three
new
diseases
besides
a
new
way
of
breaking
your
it
a
nice
way
said
bruno
hum
not
the
warden
said
as
we
entered
the
library
here
the
professor
good
morning
professor
hope
quite
rested
after
your
journey
a
fat
little
man
in
a
flowery
with
a
large
book
under
each
arm
came
trotting
in
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
was
going
straight
across
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
children
looking
for
vol
three
he
said
you
happen
to
have
seen
it
see
my
professor
the
warden
exclaimed
taking
him
by
the
shoulders
and
turning
him
round
to
face
them
the
professor
laughed
violently
then
he
gazed
at
them
through
his
great
spectacles
for
a
minute
or
two
without
speaking
at
last
he
addressed
bruno
hope
you
have
had
a
good
night
my
child
bruno
looked
puzzled
had
the
same
night
had
he
replied
only
been
night
since
yesterday
it
was
the
turn
to
look
puzzled
now
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
rubbed
them
with
his
hankerchief
then
he
gazed
at
them
again
then
he
turned
to
the
warden
they
bound
he
enquired
we
said
bruno
who
thought
himself
quite
able
to
answer
question
the
professor
shook
his
head
sadly
even
we
be
said
bruno
not
prisoners
but
the
professor
had
forgotten
all
about
them
by
this
time
and
was
speaking
to
the
warden
again
be
glad
to
hear
he
was
saying
the
beginning
to
which
way
said
the
to
the
children
that
care
you
know
only
thinks
it
affects
the
weather
a
wonderfully
clever
man
you
know
sometimes
he
says
things
that
only
the
other
professor
can
understand
sometimes
he
says
things
that
can
understand
which
way
is
it
professor
up
or
down
said
the
professor
gently
clapping
his
hands
going
i
may
so
express
what
kind
of
weather
does
produce
said
the
warden
children
now
hear
something
worth
knowing
weather
said
the
professor
and
made
straight
for
the
door
very
nearly
trampling
on
bruno
who
had
only
just
time
to
get
out
of
his
way
he
learned
the
warden
said
looking
after
him
with
admiring
eyes
he
runs
over
with
learning
he
run
over
said
bruno
the
professor
was
back
in
a
moment
he
had
changed
his
for
a
and
had
put
on
a
pair
of
very
boots
the
tops
of
which
were
open
umbrellas
thought
like
to
see
them
he
said
are
the
boots
for
horizontal
weather
the
use
of
wearing
umbrellas
round
knees
rain
the
professor
admitted
would
be
of
much
use
but
if
ever
it
rained
you
know
they
would
be
invaluable
the
professor
to
the
children
said
the
warden
tell
them
not
to
wait
for
me
i
had
breakfast
early
as
some
business
to
attend
the
children
seized
the
hands
as
familiarly
as
if
they
had
known
him
for
years
and
hurried
him
away
i
followed
respectfully

inconnue
as
we
entered
the
the
professor
was
saying
he
had
breakfast
by
himself
early
so
he
begged
you
wait
for
him
my
lady
this
way
my
lady
he
added
way
and
then
with
as
it
seemed
to
me
most
superfluous
politeness
he
flung
open
the
door
of
my
compartment
and
ushered
in
young
and
lovely
lady
i
muttered
to
myself
with
some
bitterness
this
is
of
course
the
opening
scene
of
vol
i
is
the
heroine
and
am
one
of
those
subordinate
characters
that
only
turn
up
when
needed
for
the
development
of
her
destiny
and
whose
final
appearance
is
outside
the
church
waiting
to
greet
the
happy
pair
my
lady
change
at
fayfield
were
the
next
words
i
heard
oh
that
too
obsequious
guard
station
but
and
the
door
closed
and
the
lady
settled
down
into
her
corner
and
the
monotonous
throb
of
the
engine
making
one
feel
as
if
the
train
were
some
gigantic
monster
whose
very
circulation
we
could
feel
proclaimed
that
we
were
once
more
speeding
on
our
way
lady
had
a
perfectly
formed
nose
i
caught
myself
saying
to
myself
eyes
and
and
here
it
occurred
to
me
that
to
see
for
myself
what
was
really
like
would
be
more
satisfactory
than
much
speculation
i
looked
round
cautiously
entirely
disappointed
of
my
hope
the
veil
which
shrouded
her
whole
face
was
too
thick
for
me
to
see
more
than
the
glitter
of
bright
eyes
and
the
hazy
outline
of
what
be
a
lovely
oval
face
but
might
also
unfortunately
be
an
equally
one
i
closed
my
eyes
again
saying
to
myself
have
a
better
chance
for
an
experiment
in
telepathy
her
face
and
afterwards
test
the
portrait
with
the
at
first
no
result
at
all
crowned
my
efforts
though
i
my
swift
mind
now
hither
now
thither
in
a
way
that
i
felt
sure
would
have
made
æneas
green
with
envy
but
the
oval
remained
as
provokingly
blank
as
mere
ellipse
as
if
in
some
mathematical
diagram
without
even
the
foci
that
might
be
made
to
do
duty
as
a
nose
and
a
mouth
gradually
however
the
conviction
came
upon
me
that
i
could
by
a
certain
concentration
of
thought
the
veil
and
so
get
a
glimpse
of
the
mysterious
to
which
the
two
questions
she
pretty
and
she
plain
still
hung
suspended
in
my
mind
in
beautiful
equipoise
success
was
there
a
result
ever
and
anon
the
veil
seemed
to
vanish
in
a
sudden
flash
of
light
but
before
i
could
fully
realise
the
face
all
was
dark
again
in
each
such
glimpse
the
face
seemed
to
grow
more
childish
and
more
innocent
and
when
i
had
at
last
the
veil
entirely
away
it
was
unmistakeably
the
sweet
face
of
little
sylvie
either
been
dreaming
about
sylvie
i
said
to
myself
this
is
the
reality
or
else
really
been
with
sylvie
and
this
is
a
dream
is
life
itself
a
dream
i
wonder
to
occupy
the
time
i
got
out
the
letter
which
had
caused
me
to
take
this
sudden
from
my
london
home
down
to
a
strange
on
the
north
coast
and
read
it
over
again
old
sure
it
will
be
as
great
a
pleasure
to
me
as
it
can
possibly
be
to
you
to
meet
once
more
after
so
many
years
and
of
course
i
shall
be
ready
to
give
you
all
the
benefit
of
such
medical
skill
as
i
have
only
you
know
one
violate
professional
etiquette
and
you
are
already
in
the
hands
of
a
london
doctor
with
whom
it
would
be
utter
affectation
for
me
to
pretend
to
compete
i
make
no
doubt
he
is
right
in
saying
the
heart
is
affected
all
your
symptoms
point
that
way
one
thing
at
any
rate
i
have
already
done
in
my
doctorial
you
a
bedroom
on
the
so
that
you
will
not
need
to
ascend
the
stairs
at
shall
expect
you
by
last
train
on
friday
in
accordance
with
your
letter
and
till
then
i
shall
say
in
the
words
of
the
old
song
for
friday
nicht
lang
do
you
believe
in
fate
this
postscript
puzzled
me
sorely
is
far
too
sensible
a
man
i
thought
have
become
a
fatalist
and
yet
what
else
can
he
mean
by
it
and
as
i
folded
up
the
letter
and
put
it
away
i
inadvertently
repeated
the
words
aloud
you
believe
in
fate
the
fair
turned
her
head
quickly
at
the
sudden
question
i
she
said
with
a
smile
you
mean
to
ask
the
question
i
stammered
a
little
taken
aback
at
having
begun
a
conversation
in
so
unconventional
a
fashion
the
smile
became
a
a
mocking
laugh
but
the
laugh
of
a
happy
child
who
is
perfectly
at
her
ease
you
she
said
it
was
a
case
of
what
you
doctors
call
am
no
doctor
i
replied
i
look
so
like
one
or
what
makes
you
think
it
she
pointed
to
the
book
i
had
been
reading
which
was
so
lying
that
its
title
of
the
heart
was
plainly
visible
be
a
i
said
take
an
interest
in
medical
books
another
class
of
readers
who
are
yet
more
deeply
mean
the
she
interrupted
while
a
look
of
tender
pity
gave
new
sweetness
to
her
face
with
an
evident
wish
to
avoid
a
possibly
painful
topic
be
to
take
an
interest
in
books
of
which
contain
the
greatest
amount
of
science
do
you
think
the
books
or
the
minds
a
profound
question
for
a
lady
i
said
to
myself
holding
with
the
conceit
so
natural
to
man
that
intellect
is
essentially
shallow
and
i
considered
a
minute
before
replying
you
mean
minds
i
think
possible
to
decide
there
is
so
much
science
that
no
living
person
has
ever
and
there
is
so
much
science
that
yet
been
but
if
you
mean
the
whole
human
race
then
i
think
the
have
it
everything
recorded
in
must
have
once
been
in
some
you
that
rather
like
one
of
the
rules
in
algebra
my
lady
enquired
too
i
thought
with
increasing
wonder
mean
if
we
consider
thoughts
as
may
we
not
say
that
the
least
common
multiple
of
all
the
contains
that
of
all
the
but
not
the
other
way
we
may
i
replied
delighted
with
the
illustration
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
be
i
went
on
dreamily
thinking
aloud
rather
than
talking
we
could
only
that
rule
to
books
you
know
in
finding
the
least
common
multiple
we
strike
out
a
quantity
wherever
it
occurs
except
in
the
term
where
it
is
raised
to
its
highest
power
so
we
should
have
to
erase
every
recorded
thought
except
in
the
sentence
where
it
is
expressed
with
the
greatest
my
lady
laughed
merrily
books
would
be
reduced
to
blank
paper
afraid
she
said
would
most
libraries
would
be
terribly
diminished
in
but
just
think
what
they
would
gain
in
will
it
be
done
she
eagerly
asked
any
chance
of
it
in
time
i
think
leave
off
reading
and
wait
for
it
perhaps
in
another
thousand
years
or
no
use
waiting
said
my
lady
sit
down
uggug
my
pet
come
and
sit
by
me
but
by
growled
the
little
wretch
always
manages
to
upset
his
coffee
i
guessed
at
once
as
perhaps
the
reader
will
also
have
guessed
if
like
myself
he
is
clever
at
drawing
conclusions
that
my
lady
was
the
wife
and
that
uggug
a
hideous
fat
boy
about
the
same
age
as
sylvie
with
the
expression
of
a
was
their
son
sylvie
and
bruno
with
the
lord
chancellor
made
up
a
party
of
seven

a
portable

actually
got
a

morning
said
the
seemingly
in
continuation
of
a
conversation
with
the
professor
at
the
little
certainly
certainly
the
professor
replied
with
a
smile
on
his
jolly
face
me
to
explain
it
is
in
fact
a
very
simple
problem
in
hydrodynamics
that
means
a
combination
of
water
and
strength
if
we
take
a
and
a
man
of
great
strength
such
as
myself
about
to
plunge
into
it
we
have
a
perfect
example
of
this
science
i
am
bound
to
admit
the
professor
continued
in
a
lower
tone
and
with
downcast
eyes
we
need
a
man
of
strength
he
must
be
able
to
spring
from
the
floor
to
about
twice
his
own
height
gradually
turning
over
as
he
rises
so
as
to
come
down
again
head
you
need
a
not
a
exclaimed
the
me
said
the
professor
particular
kind
of
bath
is
adapted
for
a
flea
let
us
suppose
he
continued
folding
his
into
a
graceful
festoon
this
represents
what
is
perhaps
necessity
of
this
active
portable
bath
you
may
describe
it
briefly
if
you
like
looking
at
the
chancellor
the
letters
the
chancellor
much
disconcerted
at
finding
everybody
looking
at
him
could
only
murmur
in
a
shy
whisper
so
great
advantage
of
this
continued
the
professor
that
it
requires
only
of
call
it
a

your
active
tourist

right
under

gently
replied

up

then
empties
the
into
the
empty
jug
below

round
him
to
the
top
of

you
are
he
triumphantly
concluded
is
as
much
under
water
as
if
gone
a
mile
or
two
down
into
the
atlantic
drowned
let
us
say
in
about
four
no
means
the
professor
answered
with
a
proud
smile
about
a
minute
he
quietly
turns
a
tap
at
the
lower
end
of
the
the
water
runs
back
into
the
there
you
are
again
how
in
the
world
is
he
to
get
of
the
bag
again
i
take
it
said
the
professor
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
whole
invention
all
the
way
up
the
inside
are
loops
for
the
thumbs
so
something
like
going
only
perhaps
less
comfortable
and
by
the
time
the
has
risen
out
of
the
bag
all
but
his
head
sure
to
topple
over
one
way
or
the
law
of
gravity
secures
and
there
he
is
on
the
floor
again
little
bruised
perhaps
yes
a
little
bruised
but
had
his
the
great
almost
beyond
belief
murmured
the
the
professor
took
it
as
a
compliment
and
bowed
with
a
gratified
smile
beyond
belief
my
lady
no
doubt
to
be
more
complimentary
still
the
professor
bowed
but
he
smile
time
can
assure
you
he
said
earnestly
the
bath
was
i
used
it
every
morning
i
certainly
i
am
clear
only
doubt
is
whether
the
man
ever
finished
making
it
difficult
to
remember
after
so
many
at
this
moment
the
door
very
slowly
and
creakingly
began
to
open
and
sylvie
and
bruno
jumped
up
and
ran
to
meet
the
footstep
chapter
iii
my
brother
the
exclaimed
in
a
warning
whisper
out
and
be
quick
about
it
the
appeal
was
evidently
addressed
to
the
lord
chancellor
who
instantly
replied
in
a
shrill
monotone
like
a
little
boy
repeating
the
alphabet
i
was
remarking
your
this
portentous
began
too
soon
the
other
interrupted
scarcely
able
to
restrain
himself
to
a
whisper
so
great
was
his
excitement
have
heard
you
begin
again
i
was
remarking
chanted
the
obedient
lord
chancellor
portentous
movement
has
already
assumed
the
dimensions
of
a
revolution
what
the
dimensions
of
a
revolution
the
voice
was
genial
and
mellow
and
the
face
of
the
tall
dignified
old
man
who
had
just
entered
the
room
leading
sylvie
by
the
hand
and
with
bruno
riding
triumphantly
on
his
shoulder
was
too
noble
and
gentle
to
have
scared
a
less
guilty
man
but
the
lord
chancellor
turned
pale
instantly
and
could
hardly
articulate
the
words
high
excellency
comprehend
the
length
breadth
and
thickness
if
you
like
it
better
and
the
old
man
smiled
the
lord
chancellor
recovered
himself
with
a
great
effort
and
pointed
to
the
open
window
your
high
excellency
will
listen
for
a
moment
to
the
shouts
of
the
exasperated
the
exasperated
populace
the
repeated
in
a
louder
tone
as
the
lord
chancellor
being
in
a
state
of
abject
terror
had
dropped
almost
into
a
whisper
will
understand
what
it
is
they
and
at
that
moment
there
surged
into
the
room
a
hoarse
confused
cry
in
which
the
only
clearly
audible
words
were
the
old
man
laughed
heartily
in
the
he
was
beginning
but
the
chancellor
heard
him
not
mistake
he
muttered
hurrying
to
the
window
from
which
he
shortly
returned
with
an
air
of
relief
listen
he
exclaimed
holding
up
his
hand
impressively
and
now
the
words
came
quite
distinctly
and
with
the
regularity
of
the
ticking
of
a
clock
bread
the
warden
repeated
in
astonishment
the
new
government
bakery
was
opened
only
last
week
and
i
gave
orders
to
sell
the
bread
at
during
the
present
scarcity
what
they
expect
more
closed
the
chancellor
said
more
loudly
and
clearly
than
he
had
spoken
yet
he
was
emboldened
by
the
consciousness
that
at
least
he
had
evidence
to
produce
and
he
placed
in
the
hands
a
few
printed
notices
that
were
lying
ready
with
some
open
ledgers
on
a
yes
see
the
warden
muttered
glancing
carelessly
through
them
countermanded
by
my
brother
and
supposed
to
be
doing
rather
sharp
practice
all
right
he
added
in
a
louder
tone
name
is
signed
to
it
so
i
take
it
on
myself
but
what
do
they
mean
by
how
they
be
less
i
abolished
the
last
of
them
a
month
ago
been
put
on
again
and
by
own
orders
and
other
printed
notices
were
submitted
for
inspection
the
warden
whilst
looking
them
over
glanced
once
or
twice
at
the
who
had
seated
himself
before
one
of
the
open
ledgers
and
was
quite
absorbed
in
adding
it
up
but
he
merely
repeated
all
right
i
accept
it
as
my
they
do
say
the
chancellor
went
on
much
more
like
a
convicted
thief
than
an
officer
of
state
a
change
of
government
by
the
abolition
of
the
mean
he
hastily
added
on
seeing
the
look
of
astonishment
abolition
of
the
of
and
giving
the
present
holder
the
right
to
act
as
whenever
the
warden
is
appease
all
this
seedling
discontent
i
mean
he
added
glancing
at
a
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
this
discontent
fifteen
years
put
in
a
deep
but
very
harsh
voice
husband
has
been
acting
as
it
is
too
long
it
is
much
too
long
my
lady
was
a
vast
creature
at
all
times
but
when
she
frowned
and
folded
her
arms
as
now
she
looked
more
gigantic
than
ever
and
made
one
try
to
fancy
what
a
haystack
would
look
like
if
out
of
temper
would
distinguish
himself
as
a
vice
my
lady
proceeded
being
far
too
stupid
to
see
the
double
meaning
of
her
words
has
been
no
such
vice
in
outland
for
many
a
long
year
as
he
would
be
course
would
suggest
sister
the
warden
mildly
enquired
my
lady
stamped
which
was
undignified
and
snorted
which
was
ungraceful
is
no
matter
she
bellowed
will
consult
my
brother
said
the
warden
seven
makes
a
hundred
and
which
is
sixteen
and
twopence
the
replied
down
two
and
carry
the
chancellor
raised
his
hands
and
eyebrows
lost
in
admiration
a
man
of
business
he
murmured
could
i
have
a
word
with
you
in
my
study
the
warden
said
in
a
louder
tone
the
rose
with
alacrity
and
the
two
left
the
room
together
my
lady
turned
to
the
professor
who
had
uncovered
the
urn
and
was
taking
its
temperature
with
his
she
began
so
loudly
and
suddenly
that
even
uggug
who
had
gone
to
sleep
in
his
chair
left
off
snoring
and
opened
one
eye
the
professor
pocketed
his
thermometer
in
a
moment
clasped
his
hands
and
put
his
head
on
one
side
with
a
meek
smile
were
teaching
my
son
before
breakfast
i
believe
my
lady
loftily
remarked
hope
he
strikes
you
as
having
talent
very
much
so
indeed
my
lady
the
professor
hastily
replied
unconsciously
rubbing
his
ear
while
some
painful
recollection
seemed
to
cross
his
mind
was
very
forcibly
struck
by
his
magnificence
i
assure
you
is
a
charming
boy
my
lady
exclaimed
his
snores
are
more
musical
than
those
of
other
boys
if
that
so
the
professor
seemed
to
think
the
snores
of
boys
must
be
something
too
awful
to
be
endured
but
he
was
a
cautious
man
and
he
said
nothing
so
clever
my
lady
continued
one
will
enjoy
your
lecture
the
way
have
you
fixed
the
time
for
it
yet
never
given
one
you
know
and
it
was
promised
years
ago
before
yes
my
lady
know
perhaps
next
tuesday
will
do
very
well
said
my
lady
graciously
course
you
will
let
the
other
professor
lecture
as
well
think
my
lady
the
professor
said
with
some
hesitation
see
he
always
stands
with
his
back
to
the
audience
it
does
very
well
for
but
for
are
quite
right
said
my
lady
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
there
would
hardly
be
time
for
more
than
lecture
and
it
will
go
off
all
the
better
if
we
begin
with
a
banquet
and
a
will
indeed
the
professor
cried
with
enthusiasm
shall
come
as
a
my
lady
calmly
proceeded
shall
come
as
professor
the
professor
smiled
feebly
shall
come
early
as
i
can
my
lady
come
in
before
the
doors
are
opened
said
my
lady
said
the
professor
me
a
moment
as
this
is
lady
birthday
i
would
like
and
he
rushed
away
bruno
began
feeling
in
his
pockets
looking
more
and
more
melancholy
as
he
did
so
then
he
put
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
and
considered
for
a
minute
then
he
quietly
left
the
room
he
had
hardly
done
so
before
the
professor
was
back
again
quite
out
of
breath
you
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
my
dear
child
he
went
on
addressing
the
smiling
little
girl
who
had
run
to
meet
him
me
to
give
you
a
a
pincushion
my
dear
and
it
only
cost
you
pretty
and
sylvie
rewarded
the
old
man
with
a
hearty
kiss
the
they
gave
me
for
nothing
the
professor

with
when
he
runs
away
from
his
lessons

what

is

uggug
who
had
taken
the
from
the
table
and
was
standing
behind
her
with
a
wicked
leer
on
his
face
i
guess
sylvie
said
without
looking
up
she
was
still
examining
the
pincushion
cried
the
bad
boy
exultingly
as
he
emptied
the
dish
over
her
and
then
with
a
grin
of
delight
at
his
own
cleverness
looked
round
for
applause
sylvie
coloured
crimson
as
she
shook
off
the
butter
from
her
frock
but
she
kept
her
lips
tight
shut
and
walked
away
to
the
window
where
she
stood
looking
out
and
trying
to
recover
her
temper
triumph
was
a
very
short
one
the
had
returned
just
in
time
to
be
a
witness
of
his
dear
playfulness
and
in
another
moment
a
box
on
the
ear
had
changed
the
grin
of
delight
into
a
howl
of
pain
darling
cried
his
mother
enfolding
him
in
her
fat
arms
they
box
his
ears
for
nothing
a
precious
pet
not
for
growled
the
angry
father
you
aware
madam
that
pay
the
out
of
a
fixed
annual
sum
the
loss
of
all
that
wasted
butter
falls
on
do
you
hear
madam
your
tongue
sir
my
lady
spoke
very
in
a
whisper
but
there
was
something
in
her
which
silenced
him
you
see
it
was
only
a
and
a
very
clever
one
too
he
only
meant
that
he
loved
nobody
her
and
instead
of
being
pleased
with
the
compliment
the
spiteful
little
thing
has
gone
away
in
a
huff
the
was
a
very
good
hand
at
changing
a
subject
he
walked
across
to
the
window
dear
he
said
that
a
that
i
see
down
below
rooting
about
among
your
shrieked
my
lady
rushing
madly
to
the
window
and
almost
pushing
her
husband
out
in
her
anxiety
to
see
for
herself
pig
is
it
how
did
it
get
in
that
crazy
gardener
gone
at
this
moment
bruno
the
room
and
passing
uggug
who
was
blubbering
his
loudest
in
the
hope
of
attracting
notice
as
if
he
was
quite
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
he
ran
up
to
sylvie
and
threw
his
arms
round
her
went
to
my
he
said
with
a
very
sorrowful
face
see
if
there
were
fit
for
a
present
for
oo
and
there
broken
every
one
and
i
got
money
left
to
buy
oo
a
and
i
give
oo
nuffin
but
was
a
very
earnest
hug
and
a
kiss
thank
you
darling
cried
sylvie
like
present
best
of
all
but
if
so
why
did
she
give
it
back
so
quickly
his
turned
and
patted
the
two
children
on
the
head
with
his
long
lean
hands
away
dears
he
said
business
to
talk
sylvie
and
bruno
went
away
hand
in
hand
but
on
reaching
the
door
sylvie
came
back
again
and
went
up
to
uggug
timidly
mind
about
the
butter
she
said
sorry
he
hurt
you
and
she
tried
to
shake
hands
with
the
little
ruffian
but
uggug
only
blubbered
louder
and
make
friends
sylvie
left
the
room
with
a
sigh
the
glared
angrily
at
his
weeping
son
the
room
sirrah
he
said
as
loud
as
he
dared
his
wife
was
still
leaning
out
of
the
window
and
kept
repeating
see
that
pig
where
it
moved
to
the
gone
a
little
to
the
left
said
the
but
he
had
his
back
to
the
window
and
was
making
signals
to
the
lord
chancellor
pointing
to
uggug
and
the
door
with
many
a
cunning
nod
and
wink
illustration
removal
of
uggug
the
chancellor
caught
his
meaning
at
last
and
crossing
the
room
took
that
interesting
child
by
the
next
moment
he
and
uggug
were
out
of
the
room
and
the
door
shut
behind
them
but
not
before
one
piercing
yell
had
rung
through
the
room
and
reached
the
ears
of
the
fond
mother
that
hideous
noise
she
fiercely
asked
turning
upon
her
startled
husband
some
other
replied
the
looking
vaguely
up
to
the
ceiling
as
if
that
was
where
they
usually
were
to
be
found
us
to
business
my
dear
here
comes
the
and
he
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
wandering
scrap
of
manuscript
on
which
i
just
caught
the
words
which
election
duly
holden
the
said
sibimet
and
tabikat
his
wife
may
at
their
pleasure
assume
before
with
a
guilty
look
he
crumpled
it
up
in
his
hand
chapter
iv
a
cunning
conspiracy
the
warden
entered
at
this
moment
and
close
behind
him
came
the
lord
chancellor
a
little
flushed
and
out
of
breath
and
adjusting
his
wig
which
appeared
to
have
been
dragged
partly
off
his
head
where
is
my
precious
child
my
lady
enquired
as
the
four
took
their
seats
at
the
small
devoted
to
ledgers
and
bundles
and
bills
left
the
room
a
few
minutes
the
lord
chancellor
the
briefly
explained
said
my
lady
graciously
smiling
on
that
high
official
lordship
has
a
very
way
with
children
i
doubt
if
any
one
could
the
of
my
darling
uggug
so
quickly
as
can
for
an
entirely
stupid
woman
my
remarks
were
curiously
full
of
meaning
of
which
she
herself
was
wholly
unconscious
the
chancellor
bowed
but
with
a
very
uneasy
air
think
the
warden
was
about
to
speak
he
remarked
evidently
anxious
to
change
the
subject
but
my
lady
would
not
be
checked
is
a
clever
boy
she
continued
with
enthusiasm
he
needs
a
man
like
your
lordship
to
him
the
chancellor
bit
his
lip
and
was
silent
he
evidently
feared
that
stupid
as
she
looked
she
understood
what
she
said
time
and
was
having
a
joke
at
his
expense
he
might
have
spared
himself
all
anxiety
whatever
accidental
meaning
her
might
have
she
never
meant
anything
at
all
is
all
settled
the
warden
announced
wasting
no
time
over
preliminaries
is
abolished
and
my
brother
is
appointed
to
act
as
whenever
i
am
absent
so
as
i
am
going
abroad
for
a
while
he
will
enter
on
his
new
duties
at
there
will
really
be
a
vice
after
all
my
lady
enquired
hope
so
the
warden
smilingly
replied
my
lady
looked
much
pleased
and
tried
to
clap
her
hands
but
you
might
as
well
have
knocked
two
together
for
any
noise
it
made
my
husband
is
vice
she
said
will
be
the
same
as
if
we
had
a
vices
hear
cried
the
seem
to
think
it
very
remarkable
my
lady
remarked
with
some
severity
your
wife
should
speak
the
truth
not
at
all
her
husband
anxiously
explained
is
remarkable
that
say
sweet
one
my
lady
smiled
approval
of
the
sentiment
and
went
on
am
i
you
choose
to
use
that
title
said
the
warden
will
be
the
proper
style
of
address
and
i
trust
that
both
and
will
observe
the
agreement
i
have
drawn
up
the
provision
i
am
anxious
about
is
he
unrolled
a
large
parchment
scroll
and
read
aloud
the
words
that
we
will
be
kind
to
the
the
chancellor
worded
it
for
me
he
added
glancing
at
that
great
functionary
suppose
now
that
word
has
some
deep
legal
meaning
replied
the
chancellor
as
articulately
as
he
could
with
a
pen
between
his
lips
he
was
nervously
rolling
and
unrolling
several
other
scrolls
and
making
room
among
them
for
the
one
the
warden
had
just
handed
to
him
are
merely
the
rough
copies
he
explained
as
soon
as
i
have
put
in
the
final
making
a
great
commotion
among
the
different
parchments
or
two
that
i
have
accidentally
here
he
darted
about
pen
in
hand
from
one
part
of
the
scroll
to
another
spreading
sheets
of
over
his
corrections
will
be
ready
for
it
not
be
read
out
first
my
lady
enquired
need
no
need
the
and
the
chancellor
exclaimed
at
the
same
moment
with
feverish
eagerness
need
at
all
the
warden
gently
assented
husband
and
i
have
gone
through
it
together
it
provides
that
he
shall
exercise
the
full
authority
of
warden
and
shall
have
the
disposal
of
the
annual
revenue
attached
to
the
office
until
my
return
or
failing
that
until
bruno
comes
of
age
and
that
he
shall
then
hand
over
to
myself
or
to
bruno
as
the
case
may
be
the
wardenship
the
unspent
revenue
and
the
contents
of
the
treasury
which
are
to
be
preserved
intact
under
his
all
this
time
the
was
busy
with
the
help
shifting
the
papers
from
side
to
side
and
pointing
out
to
the
warden
the
place
where
he
was
to
sign
he
then
signed
it
himself
and
my
lady
and
the
chancellor
added
their
names
as
witnesses
partings
are
best
said
the
warden
is
ready
for
my
journey
my
children
are
waiting
below
to
see
me
he
gravely
kissed
my
lady
shook
hands
with
his
brother
and
the
chancellor
and
left
the
room
illustration
a
game
the
three
waited
in
silence
till
the
sound
of
wheels
announced
that
the
warden
was
out
of
hearing
then
to
my
surprise
they
broke
into
peals
of
uncontrollable
laughter
a
game
oh
what
a
game
cried
the
chancellor
and
he
and
the
joined
hands
and
skipped
wildly
about
the
room
my
lady
was
too
dignified
to
skip
but
she
laughed
like
the
neighing
of
a
horse
and
waved
her
handkerchief
above
her
head
it
was
clear
to
her
very
limited
understanding
that
very
clever
had
been
done
but
what
it
she
had
yet
to
learn
said
i
should
hear
all
about
it
when
the
warden
had
gone
she
remarked
as
soon
as
she
could
make
herself
heard
so
you
shall
tabby
her
husband
graciously
replied
as
he
removed
the
and
showed
the
two
parchments
lying
side
by
side
is
the
one
he
read
but
sign
and
this
is
the
one
he
signed
but
read
you
see
it
was
all
covered
up
except
the
place
for
signing
the
yes
my
lady
interrupted
eagerly
and
began
comparing
the
two
agreements
that
he
shall
exercise
the
authority
of
warden
in
the
why
been
changed
into
be
absolute
governor
for
life
with
the
title
of
emperor
if
elected
to
that
office
by
the
what
are
you
darling
yet
dear
the
replied
do
to
let
this
paper
be
seen
just
at
present
all
in
good
my
lady
nodded
and
read
on
that
we
will
be
kind
to
the
why
omitted
altogether
it
is
said
her
husband
not
going
to
bother
about
the
wretches
said
my
lady
with
emphasis
and
read
on
again
that
the
contents
of
the
treasury
be
preserved
why
altered
into
be
at
the
absolute
disposal
of
the
well
sibby
that
a
clever
trick
the
jewels
only
think
may
i
go
and
put
them
on
directly
not
yet
lovey
her
husband
uneasily
replied
see
the
public
mind
quite
for
it
yet
we
must
feel
our
way
of
course
have
the
out
at
once
and
take
the
title
of
emperor
as
soon
as
we
can
safely
hold
an
election
but
hardly
stand
our
using
the
as
long
as
they
know
the
alive
we
must
spread
a
report
of
his
death
a
little
conspiracy
cried
the
delighted
lady
clapping
her
hands
all
things
i
like
a
conspiracy
so
interesting
the
and
the
chancellor
interchanged
a
wink
or
two
her
conspire
to
her
content
the
cunning
chancellor
whispered
do
no
harm
when
will
the
her
husband
hastily
interrupted
her
as
the
door
opened
and
sylvie
and
bruno
came
in
with
their
arms
twined
lovingly
round
each
sobbing
convulsively
with
his
face
hidden
on
his
shoulder
and
sylvie
more
grave
and
quiet
but
with
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
cry
like
that
the
said
sharply
but
without
any
effect
on
the
weeping
children
up
a
bit
he
hinted
to
my
lady
my
lady
muttered
to
herself
with
great
decision
crossing
the
room
and
opening
a
cupboard
from
which
she
presently
returned
with
two
slices
of
and
cry
were
her
short
and
simple
orders
and
the
poor
children
sat
down
side
by
side
but
seemed
in
no
mood
for
eating
for
the
second
time
the
door
rather
was
open
this
time
as
uggug
rushed
violently
into
the
room
shouting
old
come
again
not
to
have
any
the
was
beginning
but
the
chancellor
interrupted
him
all
right
he
said
in
a
low
voice
servants
have
their
just
under
here
said
uggug
who
had
gone
to
the
window
and
was
looking
down
into
the
my
darling
said
his
fond
mother
flinging
her
arms
round
the
neck
of
the
little
monster
all
of
us
except
sylvie
and
bruno
who
took
no
notice
of
what
was
going
on
followed
her
to
the
window
the
old
beggar
looked
up
at
us
with
hungry
eyes
a
crust
of
bread
your
highness
he
pleaded
he
was
a
fine
old
man
but
looked
sadly
ill
and
worn
crust
of
bread
is
what
i
crave
he
repeated
single
crust
and
a
little
water
illustration
this
some
water
drink
this
uggug
bellowed
emptying
a
jug
of
water
over
his
head
done
my
boy
cried
the
the
way
to
settle
such
folk
boy
the
wardeness
chimed
in
he
good
spirits
a
stick
to
him
shouted
the
as
the
old
beggar
shook
the
water
from
his
ragged
cloak
and
again
gazed
meekly
upwards
a
poker
to
him
my
lady
again
chimed
in
possibly
there
was
no
poker
handy
but
some
were
forthcoming
in
a
moment
and
threatening
faces
surrounded
the
poor
old
wanderer
who
waved
them
back
with
quiet
dignity
need
to
break
my
old
bones
he
said
am
going
not
even
a
crust
old
man
exclaimed
a
little
voice
at
my
side
half
choked
with
sobs
bruno
was
at
the
window
trying
to
throw
out
his
slice
of
but
sylvie
held
him
back
have
my
cake
bruno
cried
passionately
struggling
out
of
arms
yes
darling
sylvie
gently
pleaded
it
out
gone
away
you
see
go
after
and
she
led
him
out
of
the
room
unnoticed
by
the
rest
of
the
party
who
were
wholly
absorbed
in
watching
the
old
beggar
the
conspirators
returned
to
their
seats
and
continued
their
conversation
in
an
undertone
so
as
not
to
be
heard
by
uggug
who
was
still
standing
at
the
window
the
way
there
was
something
about
bruno
succeeding
to
the
wardenship
said
my
lady
does
stand
in
the
new
agreement
the
chancellor
chuckled
the
same
word
for
word
he
said
exception
my
lady
instead
of
taken
the
liberty
to
put
he
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
put
in
you
know
indeed
i
exclaimed
in
a
burst
of
indignation
i
could
no
longer
control
to
bring
out
even
that
one
word
seemed
a
gigantic
effort
but
the
cry
once
uttered
all
effort
ceased
at
once
a
sudden
gust
swept
away
the
whole
scene
and
i
found
myself
sitting
up
staring
at
the
young
lady
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
carriage
who
had
now
thrown
back
her
veil
and
was
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
of
amused
surprise
chapter
a
palace
that
i
had
said
in
the
act
of
waking
i
felt
sure
the
hoarse
stifled
cry
was
still
ringing
in
my
ears
even
if
the
startled
look
of
my
had
not
been
evidence
enough
but
what
could
i
possibly
say
by
way
of
apology
hope
i
frighten
you
i
stammered
out
at
last
have
no
idea
what
i
said
i
was
said
indeed
the
young
lady
replied
with
quivering
lips
that
curve
themselves
into
a
smile
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
to
look
grave
it
very
sorry
was
all
i
could
say
feeling
very
penitent
and
helpless
eyes
i
thought
to
myself
whether
even
now
i
were
fairly
awake
that
sweet
look
of
innocent
wonder
is
all
too
but
sylvie
got
that
calm
resolute
that
look
of
dreamy
sadness
like
one
that
has
had
some
deep
sorrow
very
long
and
the
fancies
almost
prevented
my
hearing
the
next
words
you
had
had
a
in
your
hand
she
proceeded
about
midnight
could
understand
it
those
things
worth
the
shilling
unless
they
give
one
a
nightmare
but
only
a
you
and
she
glanced
with
a
pretty
shrug
of
contempt
at
the
book
over
which
i
had
fallen
asleep
her
friendliness
and
utter
unreserve
took
me
aback
for
a
moment
yet
there
was
no
touch
of
forwardness
or
boldness
about
the
child
almost
she
seemed
to
be
i
guessed
her
at
scarcely
over
was
the
innocent
frankness
of
some
angelic
visitant
new
to
the
ways
of
earth
and
the
if
you
will
the
society
so
i
mused
look
and
speak
in
another
ten
care
for
ghosts
then
i
ventured
to
suggest
they
are
really
terrifying
so
the
lady
assented
regular
mean
the
ghosts
of
ordinary
very
poor
affairs
i
feel
inclined
to
say
with
alexander
selkirk
tameness
is
shocking
to
and
they
never
do
any
midnight
murders
they
in
gore
to
save
their
lives
in
is
a
very
expressive
phrase
certainly
can
it
be
done
in
fluid
i
wonder
think
the
lady
readily
as
if
she
had
thought
it
out
long
ago
has
to
be
something
for
instance
you
might
welter
in
that
being
would
be
more
suitable
for
a
ghost
supposing
it
wished
to
welter
have
a
real
good
ghost
in
that
book
i
hinted
you
guess
she
exclaimed
with
the
most
engaging
frankness
and
placed
the
volume
in
my
hands
i
opened
it
eagerly
with
a
not
unpleasant
thrill
like
what
a
good
gives
one
at
the
coincidence
of
my
having
so
unexpectedly
divined
the
subject
of
her
studies
it
was
a
book
of
domestic
cookery
open
at
the
article
i
returned
the
book
looking
i
suppose
a
little
blank
as
the
lady
laughed
merrily
at
my
discomfiture
far
more
exciting
than
some
of
the
modern
ghosts
i
assure
you
now
there
was
a
ghost
last
mean
a
ghost
in
a
magazine
it
was
a
perfectly
ghost
it
have
frightened
a
mouse
it
a
ghost
that
one
would
even
offer
a
chair
to
score
years
and
ten
baldness
and
spectacles
have
their
advantages
after
all
i
said
to
myself
of
a
bashful
youth
and
maiden
gasping
out
monosyllables
at
awful
intervals
here
we
have
an
old
man
and
a
child
quite
at
their
ease
talking
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
for
years
then
you
think
i
continued
aloud
we
ought
to
ask
a
ghost
to
sit
down
but
have
we
any
authority
for
it
in
shakespeare
for
are
plenty
of
ghosts
shakespeare
ever
give
the
chair
to
the
lady
looked
puzzled
and
thoughtful
for
a
moment
then
she
clapped
her
hands
yes
he
she
cried
makes
hamlet
say
rest
perturbed
spirit
that
i
suppose
means
an
american
i
junction
my
lady
change
for
elveston
the
guard
announced
flinging
open
the
door
of
the
carriage
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
with
all
our
portable
property
around
us
on
the
platform
the
accommodation
provided
for
passengers
waiting
at
this
junction
was
distinctly
single
wooden
bench
apparently
intended
for
three
sitters
only
and
even
this
was
already
partially
occupied
by
a
very
old
man
in
a
smock
frock
who
sat
with
rounded
shoulders
and
drooping
head
and
with
hands
clasped
on
the
top
of
his
stick
so
as
to
make
a
sort
of
pillow
for
that
wrinkled
face
with
its
look
of
patient
weariness
you
be
off
the
roughly
accosted
the
poor
old
man
be
off
and
make
way
for
your
betters
this
way
my
lady
he
added
in
a
perfectly
different
tone
your
ladyship
will
take
a
seat
the
train
will
be
up
in
a
few
the
cringing
servility
of
his
manner
was
due
no
doubt
to
the
address
legible
on
the
pile
of
luggage
which
announced
their
owner
to
be
muriel
orme
passenger
to
elveston
fayfield
as
i
watched
the
old
man
slowly
rise
to
his
feet
and
hobble
a
few
paces
down
the
platform
the
lines
came
to
my
lips
sackcloth
couch
the
monk
arose
with
toil
his
limbs
he
a
hundred
years
had
flung
their
snows
on
his
thin
locks
and
floating
illustration
you
be
off
but
the
lady
scarcely
noticed
the
little
incident
after
one
glance
at
the
man
who
stood
tremulously
leaning
on
his
stick
she
turned
to
me
is
an
american
by
any
means
yet
may
i
say
slightly
changing
her
place
so
as
to
make
room
for
me
beside
her
i
say
in
words
she
broke
off
with
a
silvery
laugh
spirit
i
finished
the
sentence
for
her
that
describes
a
and
here
is
an
instance
of
it
i
added
as
the
tiny
local
train
drew
up
alongside
the
platform
and
the
porters
bustled
about
opening
of
them
helping
the
poor
old
man
to
hoist
himself
into
a
carriage
while
another
of
them
obsequiously
conducted
the
lady
and
myself
into
a
she
paused
before
following
him
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
other
passenger
old
man
she
said
weak
and
ill
he
looks
it
was
a
shame
to
let
him
be
turned
away
like
that
very
at
this
moment
it
dawned
on
me
that
these
words
were
not
addressed
to
but
that
she
was
unconsciously
thinking
aloud
i
moved
away
a
few
steps
and
waited
to
follow
her
into
the
carriage
where
i
resumed
the
conversation
have
traveled
by
rail
if
only
in
a
dream
is
such
a
happy
referring
no
doubt
she
rejoined
the
sensational
booklets
peculiar
to
the
rail
if
steam
has
done
nothing
else
it
has
at
least
added
a
whole
new
species
to
english
literature
doubt
of
it
i
echoed
true
origin
of
all
our
medical
all
our
no
she
broke
in
merrily
mean
literature
are
quite
abnormal
but
the
little
thrilling
romances
where
the
murder
comes
at
page
fifteen
and
the
wedding
at
page
are
due
to
steam
when
we
travel
by
i
may
venture
to
develop
your
shall
have
leaflets
instead
of
booklets
and
the
murder
and
the
wedding
will
come
on
the
same
development
worthy
of
darwin
the
lady
exclaimed
enthusiastically
reverse
his
theory
instead
of
developing
a
mouse
into
an
elephant
you
would
develop
an
elephant
into
a
mouse
but
here
we
plunged
into
a
tunnel
and
i
leaned
back
and
closed
my
eyes
for
a
moment
trying
to
recall
a
few
of
the
incidents
of
my
recent
dream
thought
i
i
murmured
sleepily
and
then
the
phrase
insisted
on
conjugating
itself
and
ran
into
thought
you
thought
he
and
then
it
suddenly
went
off
into
a
song
thought
he
saw
an
elephant
that
practised
on
a
fife
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
letter
from
his
wife
length
i
realise
he
said
bitterness
of
life
and
what
a
wild
being
it
was
who
sang
these
wild
words
a
gardener
he
seemed
to
surely
a
mad
one
by
the
way
he
brandished
his
by
the
way
he
broke
ever
and
anon
into
a
frantic
of
all
by
the
shriek
in
which
he
brought
out
the
last
words
of
the
stanza
it
was
so
far
a
description
of
himself
that
he
had
the
of
an
elephant
but
the
rest
of
him
was
skin
and
bone
and
the
wisps
of
loose
straw
that
bristled
all
about
him
suggested
that
he
had
been
originally
stuffed
with
it
and
that
nearly
all
the
stuffing
had
come
out
illustration
the
gardener
sylvie
and
bruno
waited
patiently
till
the
end
of
the
first
verse
then
sylvie
advanced
alone
bruno
having
suddenly
turned
shy
and
timidly
introduced
herself
with
the
words
sylvie
that
other
thing
said
the
gardener
thing
said
sylvie
looking
round
bruno
my
he
your
brother
yesterday
the
gardener
anxiously
enquired
i
were
cried
bruno
who
had
gradually
crept
nearer
and
at
all
like
being
talked
about
without
having
his
share
in
the
conversation
well
the
gardener
said
with
a
kind
of
groan
change
so
here
whenever
i
look
again
sure
to
be
something
different
yet
i
does
my
duty
i
gets
up
at
i
was
said
bruno
wriggle
so
early
as
bad
as
being
a
worm
he
added
in
an
undertone
to
sylvie
you
be
lazy
in
the
morning
bruno
said
sylvie
the
bird
that
picks
up
the
worm
may
if
it
likes
bruno
said
with
a
slight
yawn
like
eating
worms
one
bit
i
always
stop
in
bed
till
the
early
bird
has
picked
them
up
wonder
the
face
to
tell
me
such
fibs
cried
the
gardener
to
which
bruno
wisely
replied
want
a
to
tell
fibs
a
sylvie
discreetly
changed
the
subject
did
you
plant
all
these
flowers
she
said
a
lovely
garden
made
do
you
know
like
to
live
here
the
the
gardener
was
beginning
nearly
forgotten
what
we
came
about
sylvie
interrupted
you
please
let
us
through
into
the
road
a
poor
old
beggar
just
gone
very
bruno
wants
to
give
him
his
cake
you
know
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
the
gardener
muttered
taking
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
beginning
to
unlock
a
door
in
the
much
it
wurf
bruno
innocently
enquired
but
the
gardener
only
grinned
a
secret
he
said
you
come
back
quick
he
called
after
the
children
as
they
passed
out
into
the
road
i
had
just
time
to
follow
them
before
he
shut
the
door
again
we
hurried
down
the
road
and
very
soon
caught
sight
of
the
old
beggar
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
of
us
and
the
children
at
once
set
off
running
to
overtake
him
lightly
and
swiftly
they
skimmed
over
the
ground
and
i
could
not
in
the
least
understand
how
it
was
i
kept
up
with
them
so
easily
but
the
unsolved
problem
did
not
worry
me
so
much
as
at
another
time
it
might
have
done
there
were
so
many
other
things
to
attend
to
the
old
beggar
must
have
been
very
deaf
as
he
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
eager
shouting
but
trudged
wearily
on
never
pausing
until
the
child
got
in
front
of
him
and
held
up
the
slice
of
cake
the
poor
little
fellow
was
quite
out
of
breath
and
could
only
utter
the
one
word
with
the
gloomy
decision
with
which
her
excellency
had
so
lately
pronounced
it
but
with
a
sweet
childish
timidity
looking
up
into
the
old
face
with
eyes
that
loved
things
both
great
and
the
old
man
snatched
it
from
him
and
devoured
it
greedily
as
some
hungry
wild
beast
might
have
done
but
never
a
word
of
thanks
did
he
give
his
little
growled
more
and
glared
at
the
children
no
more
sylvie
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
eaten
mine
it
was
a
shame
to
let
you
be
turned
away
like
that
very
i
lost
the
rest
of
the
sentence
for
my
mind
had
recurred
with
a
great
shock
of
surprise
to
lady
muriel
orme
who
had
so
lately
uttered
these
very
words
of
and
in
own
voice
and
with
gentle
pleading
eyes
me
were
the
next
words
i
heard
as
the
old
man
waved
his
hand
with
a
dignified
grace
that
ill
suited
his
ragged
dress
over
a
bush
that
stood
by
the
road
side
which
began
instantly
to
sink
into
the
earth
at
another
time
i
might
have
doubted
the
evidence
of
my
eyes
or
at
least
have
felt
some
astonishment
but
in
strange
scene
my
whole
being
seemed
absorbed
in
strong
curiosity
as
to
what
would
happen
next
when
the
bush
had
sunk
quite
out
of
our
sight
marble
steps
were
seen
leading
downwards
into
darkness
the
old
man
led
the
way
and
we
eagerly
followed
the
staircase
was
so
dark
at
first
that
i
could
only
just
see
the
forms
of
the
children
as
they
groped
their
way
down
after
their
guide
but
it
got
lighter
every
moment
with
a
strange
silvery
brightness
that
seemed
to
exist
in
the
air
as
there
were
no
lamps
visible
and
when
at
last
we
reached
a
level
floor
the
room
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
almost
as
light
as
day
it
was
having
in
each
angle
a
slender
pillar
round
which
silken
draperies
were
twined
the
wall
between
the
pillars
was
entirely
covered
to
the
height
of
six
or
seven
feet
with
creepers
from
which
hung
quantities
of
ripe
fruit
and
of
brilliant
flowers
that
almost
hid
the
leaves
in
another
place
perchance
i
might
have
wondered
to
see
fruit
and
flowers
growing
together
here
my
chief
wonder
was
that
neither
fruit
nor
flowers
were
such
as
i
had
ever
seen
before
higher
up
each
wall
contained
a
circular
window
of
coloured
glass
and
over
all
was
an
arched
roof
that
seemed
to
be
spangled
all
over
with
jewels
with
hardly
less
wonder
i
turned
this
way
and
that
trying
to
make
out
how
in
the
world
we
had
come
in
for
there
was
no
door
and
all
the
walls
were
thickly
covered
with
the
lovely
creepers
are
safe
here
my
darlings
said
the
old
man
laying
a
hand
on
shoulder
and
bending
down
to
kiss
her
sylvie
drew
back
hastily
with
an
offended
air
but
in
another
moment
with
a
glad
cry
of
she
had
run
into
his
arms
illustration
a
palace
father
bruno
repeated
and
while
the
happy
children
were
being
hugged
and
kissed
i
could
but
rub
my
eyes
and
say
then
are
the
rags
gone
to
for
the
old
man
was
now
dressed
in
royal
robes
that
glittered
with
jewels
and
gold
embroidery
and
wore
a
circlet
of
gold
around
his
head
chapter
vi
the
magic
locket
are
we
father
sylvie
whispered
with
her
arms
twined
closely
around
the
old
neck
and
with
her
rosy
cheek
lovingly
pressed
to
his
elfland
darling
one
of
the
provinces
of
i
thought
elfland
was
so
far
from
outland
and
come
such
a
little
way
came
by
the
royal
road
sweet
one
only
those
of
royal
blood
can
travel
along
it
but
been
royal
ever
since
i
was
made
king
of
nearly
a
month
ago
they
sent
ambassadors
to
make
sure
that
their
invitation
to
me
to
be
their
new
king
should
reach
me
one
was
a
prince
so
was
able
to
come
by
the
royal
road
and
to
come
invisibly
to
all
but
me
the
other
was
a
baron
so
had
to
come
by
the
common
road
and
i
dare
say
he
even
how
far
have
we
come
sylvie
enquired
a
thousand
miles
sweet
one
since
the
gardener
unlocked
that
door
for
thousand
miles
bruno
repeated
may
i
eat
one
a
little
rogue
said
bruno
mean
may
i
eat
one
of
that
fruits
child
said
his
father
then
find
out
what
is
pleasure
we
all
seek
so
madly
and
enjoy
so
mournfully
bruno
ran
eagerly
to
the
wall
and
picked
a
fruit
that
was
something
like
a
banana
but
had
the
of
a
strawberry
he
ate
it
with
beaming
looks
that
became
gradually
more
gloomy
and
were
very
blank
indeed
by
the
time
he
had
finished
got
no
taste
at
all
he
complained
feel
nuffin
in
my
mouf
that
hard
word
sylvie
was
a
sylvie
gravely
replied
they
like
that
father
all
like
that
to
darling
because
you
belong
to
but
to
they
are
bruno
looked
puzzled
try
anuvver
kind
of
fruits
he
said
and
jumped
down
off
the
knee
some
lovely
striped
ones
just
like
a
rainbow
and
off
he
ran
meanwhile
the
and
sylvie
were
talking
together
but
in
such
low
tones
that
i
could
not
catch
the
words
so
i
followed
bruno
who
was
picking
and
eating
other
kinds
of
fruit
in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
that
had
a
taste
i
tried
to
pick
some
it
was
like
grasping
air
and
i
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
and
returned
to
sylvie
well
at
it
my
darling
the
old
man
was
saying
tell
me
how
you
like
just
cried
sylvie
delightedly
come
and
look
and
she
held
up
so
that
he
might
see
the
light
through
it
a
locket
apparently
cut
out
of
a
single
jewel
of
a
rich
blue
colour
with
a
slender
gold
chain
attached
to
it
are
welly
pretty
bruno
more
soberly
remarked
and
he
began
spelling
out
some
words
inscribed
on
it
he
made
them
out
at
last
so
they
doos
he
cried
clasping
his
arms
round
her
neck
loves
sylvie
love
her
best
we
bruno
said
the
old
king
as
he
took
possession
of
the
locket
sylvie
look
at
and
he
showed
her
lying
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
a
locket
of
a
deep
crimson
colour
the
same
shape
as
the
blue
one
and
like
it
attached
to
a
slender
golden
chain
and
lovelier
exclaimed
sylvie
clasping
her
hands
in
ecstasy
bruno
words
on
this
one
too
said
bruno
you
see
the
difference
said
the
old
man
colours
and
different
words
choose
one
of
them
darling
give
you
whichever
you
like
illustration
the
crimson
locket
sylvie
whispered
the
words
several
times
over
with
a
thoughtful
smile
and
then
made
her
decision
nice
to
be
loved
she
said
nicer
to
love
other
people
may
i
have
the
red
one
father
the
old
man
said
nothing
but
i
could
see
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
as
he
bent
his
head
and
pressed
his
lips
to
her
forehead
in
a
long
loving
kiss
then
he
undid
the
chain
and
showed
her
how
to
fasten
it
round
her
neck
and
to
hide
it
away
under
the
edge
of
her
frock
for
you
to
you
know
he
said
in
a
low
voice
for
other
people
to
remember
how
to
use
it
remember
said
sylvie
now
darlings
time
for
you
to
go
back
or
be
missing
you
and
then
that
poor
gardener
will
get
into
trouble
once
more
a
feeling
of
wonder
rose
in
my
mind
as
to
how
in
the
world
we
were
to
back
i
took
it
for
granted
that
wherever
the
children
went
was
to
no
shadow
of
doubt
seemed
to
cross
minds
as
they
hugged
and
kissed
him
murmuring
over
and
over
again
darling
father
and
then
suddenly
and
swiftly
the
darkness
of
midnight
seemed
to
close
in
upon
us
and
through
the
darkness
harshly
rang
a
strange
wild
song
thought
he
saw
a
buffalo
upon
the
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
his
sisters
niece
you
leave
this
house
he
said
send
for
the
police
illustration
thought
he
saw
a
was
he
added
looking
out
at
us
through
the
door
as
we
stood
waiting
in
the
road
what
have
sure
as
potatoes
she
have
tooken
herself
off
but
i
always
loves
my
like
are
oor
said
bruno
as
pay
for
me
a
course
the
gardener
replied
can
come
in
now
if
you
he
flung
the
door
open
as
he
spoke
and
we
got
out
a
little
dazzled
and
stupefied
at
least
felt
so
at
the
sudden
transition
from
the
of
the
to
the
platform
of
elveston
station
a
footman
in
a
handsome
livery
came
forwards
and
respectfully
touched
his
hat
carriage
is
here
my
lady
he
said
taking
from
her
the
wraps
and
small
articles
she
was
carrying
and
lady
muriel
after
shaking
hands
and
bidding
me
with
a
pleasant
smile
followed
him
it
was
with
a
somewhat
blank
and
lonely
feeling
that
i
betook
myself
to
the
van
from
which
the
luggage
was
being
taken
out
and
after
giving
directions
to
have
my
boxes
sent
after
me
i
made
my
way
on
foot
to
lodgings
and
soon
lost
my
lonely
feeling
in
the
hearty
welcome
my
old
friend
gave
me
and
the
cozy
warmth
and
cheerful
light
of
the
little
into
which
he
led
me
as
you
see
but
quite
enough
for
us
two
now
take
the
old
fellow
and
have
another
look
at
you
well
you
look
a
bit
pulled
down
and
he
put
on
a
solemn
professional
air
prescribe
ozone
social
dissipation
pilulæ
quam
to
be
taken
feasting
three
times
a
day
doctor
i
remonstrated
three
times
a
day
all
know
about
it
the
young
doctor
gaily
replied
home
at
home
kettledrum
at
home
music
elveston
give
dinners
carriages
at
there
you
are
it
sounded
very
pleasant
i
was
obliged
to
admit
i
know
some
of
the
already
i
added
of
them
came
in
the
same
carriage
with
was
she
like
then
perhaps
i
can
identify
was
lady
muriel
orme
as
to
what
she
was
thought
her
very
beautiful
do
you
know
her
do
know
and
the
grave
doctor
coloured
slightly
as
he
added
i
agree
with
you
she
quite
lost
my
heart
to
her
i
went
on
mischievously
some
supper
arthur
interrupted
with
an
air
of
relief
as
the
maid
entered
with
the
tray
and
he
steadily
resisted
all
my
attempts
to
return
to
the
subject
of
lady
muriel
until
the
evening
had
almost
worn
itself
away
then
as
we
sat
gazing
into
the
fire
and
conversation
was
lapsing
into
silence
he
made
a
hurried
confession
meant
to
tell
you
anything
about
her
he
said
naming
no
names
as
if
there
were
only
one
in
the
world
you
had
seen
more
of
her
and
formed
your
own
judgment
of
her
but
somehow
you
surprised
it
out
of
me
and
not
breathed
a
word
of
it
to
any
one
else
but
i
can
trust
with
a
secret
old
friend
yes
true
of
what
i
suppose
said
in
the
merest
jest
believe
me
i
said
earnestly
man
three
times
her
age
but
if
choice
then
sure
all
that
is
good
sweet
arthur
went
on
pure
and
and
he
broke
off
hastily
as
if
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
say
more
on
a
subject
so
sacred
and
so
precious
silence
followed
and
i
leaned
back
drowsily
in
my
filled
with
bright
and
beautiful
imaginings
of
arthur
and
his
and
of
all
the
peace
and
happiness
in
store
for
them
i
pictured
them
to
myself
walking
together
lingeringly
and
lovingly
under
arching
trees
in
a
sweet
garden
of
their
own
and
welcomed
back
by
their
faithful
gardener
on
their
return
from
some
brief
excursion
it
seemed
natural
enough
that
the
gardener
should
be
filled
with
exuberant
delight
at
the
return
of
so
gracious
a
master
and
how
strangely
childlike
they
looked
i
could
have
taken
them
for
sylvie
and
natural
that
he
should
show
it
by
such
wild
dances
such
crazy
songs
thought
he
saw
a
rattlesnake
that
questioned
him
in
greek
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
the
middle
of
next
week
one
thing
i
regret
he
said
that
it
can
not
speak
natural
of
all
that
the
and
should
be
standing
close
beside
me
discussing
an
open
letter
which
had
just
been
handed
to
him
by
the
professor
who
stood
meekly
waiting
a
few
yards
off
it
were
not
for
those
two
brats
i
heard
him
mutter
glancing
savagely
at
sylvie
and
bruno
who
were
courteously
listening
to
the
song
would
be
no
difficulty
hear
that
bit
of
the
letter
again
said
my
lady
and
the
read
aloud
we
therefore
entreat
you
graciously
to
accept
the
kingship
to
which
you
have
been
unanimously
elected
by
the
council
of
elfland
and
that
you
will
allow
your
son
whose
goodness
cleverness
and
beauty
reports
have
reached
be
regarded
as
the
difficulty
said
my
lady
you
see
the
ambassador
that
brought
this
is
waiting
in
the
house
and
sure
to
see
sylvie
and
bruno
and
then
when
he
sees
uggug
and
remembers
all
that
about
cleverness
and
beauty
why
sure
will
you
find
a
better
boy
than
my
lady
indignantly
interrupted
a
wittier
or
a
lovelier
to
all
of
which
the
simply
replied
you
be
a
great
blethering
goose
our
only
chance
is
to
keep
those
two
brats
out
of
sight
if
can
manage
you
may
leave
the
rest
to
make
him
believe
uggug
to
be
a
model
of
cleverness
and
all
must
change
his
name
to
bruno
of
course
said
my
lady
the
rubbed
his
chin
no
he
said
musingly
do
the
such
an
utter
idiot
never
learn
to
answer
to
indeed
cried
my
lady
no
more
an
idiot
than
am
right
my
dear
the
soothingly
replied
indeed
my
lady
was
appeased
go
in
and
receive
the
ambassador
she
said
and
beckoned
to
the
professor
room
is
he
waiting
in
she
inquired
the
library
did
you
say
his
name
was
said
the
the
professor
referred
to
a
card
he
held
in
his
hand
adiposity
the
baron
does
he
come
with
such
a
funny
name
said
my
lady
well
change
it
on
the
journey
the
professor
meekly
replied
of
the
go
and
receive
him
my
lady
said
to
the
attend
to
the
chapter
vii
the
embassy
i
was
following
the
but
on
second
thoughts
went
after
my
lady
being
curious
to
see
how
she
would
manage
to
keep
the
children
out
of
sight
i
found
her
holding
hand
and
with
her
other
hand
stroking
hair
in
a
most
tender
and
motherly
fashion
both
children
were
looking
bewildered
and
own
darlings
she
was
saying
been
planning
a
little
treat
for
you
the
professor
shall
take
you
a
long
walk
into
the
woods
this
beautiful
evening
and
you
shall
take
a
basket
of
food
with
you
and
have
a
little
picnic
down
by
the
river
bruno
jumped
and
clapped
his
hands
nice
he
cried
it
sylvie
sylvie
who
quite
lost
her
surprised
look
put
up
her
mouth
for
a
kiss
you
much
she
said
earnestly
my
lady
turned
her
head
away
to
conceal
the
broad
grin
of
triumph
that
spread
over
her
vast
face
like
a
ripple
on
a
lake
simpletons
she
muttered
to
herself
as
she
marched
up
to
the
house
i
followed
her
in
so
your
excellency
the
baron
was
saying
as
we
entered
the
library
the
infantry
were
under
he
turned
and
was
duly
presented
to
my
lady
hero
said
my
lady
the
fat
little
man
simpered
yes
he
replied
modestly
casting
down
his
eyes
ancestors
were
all
famous
for
military
my
lady
smiled
graciously
often
runs
in
families
she
remarked
as
a
love
for
pastry
the
baron
looked
slightly
offended
and
the
discreetly
changed
the
subject
will
soon
be
ready
he
said
i
have
the
honour
of
conducting
your
adiposity
to
the
certainly
the
baron
eagerly
assented
would
never
do
to
keep
waiting
and
he
almost
trotted
out
of
the
room
after
the
he
was
back
again
so
speedily
that
the
had
barely
time
to
explain
to
my
lady
that
her
remark
about
love
for
was
you
might
have
seen
with
half
an
eye
he
added
line
military
genius
indeed
pooh
ready
yet
the
baron
enquired
as
he
hurried
into
the
room
be
in
a
few
minutes
the
replied
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
you
were
telling
me
he
continued
as
the
trio
left
the
house
about
a
great
battle
in
which
you
had
the
command
of
the
said
the
baron
enemy
as
i
was
saying
far
outnumbered
us
but
i
marched
my
men
right
into
the
middle
that
the
military
hero
exclaimed
in
agitated
tones
drawing
back
behind
the
as
a
strange
creature
rushed
wildly
upon
them
brandishing
a
spade
only
the
gardener
the
replied
in
an
encouraging
tone
harmless
i
assure
you
hark
singing
his
favorite
and
once
more
those
shrill
discordant
tones
rang
out
thought
he
saw
a
clerk
descending
from
the
bus
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
hippopotamus
this
should
stay
to
dine
he
said
be
much
for
us
throwing
away
the
spade
he
broke
into
a
frantic
jig
snapping
his
fingers
and
repeating
again
and
again
be
much
for
us
there
be
much
for
us
illustration
was
a
once
more
the
baron
looked
slightly
offended
but
the
hastily
explained
that
the
song
had
no
allusion
to
and
in
fact
had
no
meaning
at
all
mean
anything
by
it
now
you
he
appealed
to
the
gardener
who
had
finished
his
song
and
stood
balancing
himself
on
one
leg
and
looking
at
them
with
his
mouth
open
never
means
nothing
said
the
gardener
and
uggug
luckily
came
up
at
the
moment
and
gave
the
conversation
a
new
turn
me
to
present
my
son
said
the
adding
in
a
whisper
of
the
best
and
cleverest
boys
that
ever
lived
contrive
for
you
to
see
some
of
his
cleverness
he
knows
everything
that
other
boys
know
and
in
archery
in
fishing
in
painting
and
in
music
his
skill
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
you
see
that
target
over
there
he
shall
shoot
an
arrow
at
it
dear
boy
he
went
on
aloud
adiposity
would
like
to
see
you
shoot
bring
his
bow
and
arrows
uggug
looked
very
sulky
as
he
received
the
bow
and
arrow
and
prepared
to
shoot
just
as
the
arrow
left
the
bow
the
trod
heavily
on
the
toe
of
the
baron
who
yelled
with
the
pain
thousand
pardons
he
exclaimed
stepped
back
in
my
excitement
see
it
is
a
the
baron
gazed
in
astonishment
held
the
bow
so
awkwardly
it
seemed
impossible
he
muttered
but
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
there
was
the
arrow
right
in
the
centre
of
the
lake
is
close
by
continued
the
his
and
uggug
most
unwillingly
held
the
rod
and
dangled
the
fly
over
the
water
beetle
on
your
arm
cried
my
lady
pinching
the
poor
arm
worse
than
if
ten
lobsters
had
seized
it
at
once
kind
is
poisonous
she
explained
a
pity
you
missed
seeing
the
fish
pulled
out
an
enormous
dead
was
lying
on
the
bank
with
the
hook
in
its
mouth
had
always
fancied
the
baron
faltered
cod
were
fish
in
country
said
the
we
go
in
ask
my
son
some
question
on
the
subject
you
like
and
the
sulky
boy
was
violently
shoved
forwards
to
walk
at
the
side
your
highness
tell
me
the
baron
cautiously
began
much
seven
times
nine
would
come
to
to
the
left
cried
the
hastily
stepping
forwards
to
show
the
hastily
that
he
ran
against
his
unfortunate
guest
who
fell
heavily
on
his
face
sorry
my
lady
exclaimed
as
she
and
her
husband
helped
him
to
his
feet
again
son
was
in
the
act
of
saying
as
you
fell
the
baron
said
nothing
he
was
covered
with
dust
and
seemed
much
hurt
both
in
body
and
mind
however
when
they
had
got
him
into
the
house
and
given
him
a
good
brushing
matters
looked
a
little
better
dinner
was
served
in
due
course
and
every
fresh
dish
seemed
to
increase
the
of
the
baron
but
all
efforts
to
get
him
to
express
his
opinion
as
to
cleverness
were
in
vain
until
that
interesting
youth
had
left
the
room
and
was
seen
from
the
open
window
prowling
about
the
lawn
with
a
little
basket
which
he
was
filling
with
frogs
fond
of
natural
history
as
he
is
dear
boy
said
the
doting
mother
tell
us
baron
what
you
think
of
him
be
perfectly
candid
said
the
cautious
baron
would
like
a
more
evidence
i
think
you
mentioned
his
skill
said
the
simply
a
prodigy
you
shall
hear
him
play
the
and
he
walked
to
the
window
mean
my
boy
come
in
for
a
minute
bring
the
with
to
turn
over
the
music
for
him
he
added
as
an
explanation
uggug
having
filled
his
basket
with
frogs
had
no
objection
to
obey
and
soon
appeared
in
the
room
followed
by
a
little
man
who
asked
the
music
vill
you
haf
sonata
that
his
highness
plays
so
charmingly
said
the
highness
haf
the
began
but
was
sharply
stopped
by
the
sir
go
and
turn
over
the
music
for
his
highness
my
dear
to
the
wardeness
you
show
him
what
to
do
and
meanwhile
baron
just
show
you
a
most
interesting
map
we
outland
and
fairyland
and
that
sort
of
illustration
the
map
of
fairyland
by
the
time
my
lady
had
returned
from
explaining
things
to
the
the
map
had
been
hung
up
and
the
baron
was
already
much
bewildered
by
the
habit
of
pointing
to
one
place
while
he
shouted
out
the
name
of
another
my
lady
joining
in
pointing
out
other
places
and
shouting
other
names
only
made
matters
worse
and
at
last
the
baron
in
despair
took
to
pointing
out
places
for
himself
and
feebly
asked
that
great
yellow
splotch
fairyland
said
the
you
might
as
well
give
him
a
hint
he
muttered
to
my
lady
going
back
he
eats
like
a
shark
it
would
hardly
do
for
to
mention
his
wife
caught
the
idea
and
at
once
began
giving
hints
of
the
most
subtle
and
delicate
kind
see
what
a
short
way
it
is
back
to
fairyland
why
if
you
started
morning
get
there
in
very
little
more
than
a
week
the
baron
looked
incredulous
took
me
a
full
month
to
he
said
ever
so
much
shorter
going
you
know
the
baron
looked
appealingly
to
the
who
chimed
in
readily

the
sonata
was
pealing
through
the
room
the
baron
could
not
help
admitting
to
himself
that
it
was
being
magnificently
played
but
he
tried
in
vain
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
youthful
performer
every
time
he
had
nearly
succeeded
in
catching
sight
of
him
either
the
or
his
wife

sure
to
get
in
the
way

out
some
new
place
on

deafening
him

interchanged

passion
thundered
out
the

and
the
door
closed
again
and
still
the
noble
sonata
went
pealing
through
the
room
but
it
was
masterly
touch
that
roused
the
echoes
and
thrilled
my
very
soul
with
the
tender
music
of
the
immortal
and
it
was
not
till
the
last
note
had
died
away
that
the
tired
but
happy
traveler
could
bring
himself
to
utter
the
words

to
seek

a
ride
on
a
lion
the
next
day
glided
away
pleasantly
enough
partly
in
settling
myself
in
my
new
quarters
and
partly
in
strolling
round
the
neighbourhood
under
guidance
and
trying
to
form
a
general
idea
of
elveston
and
its
inhabitants
when
five
arrived
arthur
any
embarrassment
this
take
me
with
him
up
to
hall
in
order
that
i
might
make
acquaintance
with
the
earl
of
ainslie
who
had
taken
it
for
the
season
and
renew
acquaintance
with
his
daughter
lady
muriel
my
first
impressions
of
the
gentle
dignified
and
yet
genial
old
man
were
entirely
favourable
and
the
satisfaction
that
showed
itself
on
his
face
as
she
met
me
with
the
words
is
indeed
an
pleasure
was
very
soothing
for
whatever
remains
of
personal
vanity
the
failures
and
disappointments
of
many
long
years
and
much
buffeting
with
a
rough
world
had
left
in
me
yet
i
noted
and
was
glad
to
note
evidence
of
a
far
deeper
feeling
than
mere
friendly
regard
in
her
meeting
with
this
was
as
i
gathered
an
almost
daily
the
conversation
between
them
in
which
the
earl
and
i
were
only
occasional
sharers
had
an
ease
and
a
spontaneity
rarely
met
with
except
between
old
friends
and
as
i
knew
that
they
had
not
known
each
other
for
a
longer
period
than
the
summer
which
was
now
rounding
into
autumn
i
felt
certain
that
and
love
alone
could
explain
the
phenomenon
convenient
it
would
be
lady
muriel
laughingly
remarked
of
my
having
insisted
on
saving
her
the
trouble
of
carrying
a
cup
of
tea
across
the
room
to
the
earl
cups
of
tea
had
no
weight
at
all
then
perhaps
ladies
would
be
permitted
to
carry
them
for
short
distances
can
easily
imagine
a
situation
said
arthur
things
would
have
no
weight
relatively
to
each
other
though
each
would
have
its
usual
weight
looked
at
by
desperate
paradox
said
the
earl
us
how
it
could
be
we
shall
never
guess
suppose
this
house
just
as
it
is
placed
a
few
billion
miles
above
a
planet
and
with
nothing
else
near
enough
to
disturb
it
of
course
it
falls
the
planet
the
earl
nodded
it
might
take
some
centuries
to
do
is
to
be
going
on
all
the
while
said
lady
muriel
and
other
things
said
arthur
inhabitants
would
live
their
lives
grow
up
and
die
and
still
the
house
would
be
falling
falling
falling
but
now
as
to
the
relative
weight
of
things
nothing
can
be
you
know
except
by
to
fall
and
being
prevented
from
doing
so
you
all
grant
that
we
all
granted
that
now
if
i
take
this
book
and
hold
it
out
at
arms
length
of
course
i
feel
its
it
is
trying
to
fall
and
i
prevent
it
and
if
i
let
go
it
falls
to
the
floor
but
if
we
were
all
falling
together
it
be
to
fall
any
quicker
you
know
for
if
i
let
go
what
more
could
it
do
than
fall
and
as
my
hand
would
be
falling
the
same
would
never
leave
it
for
that
would
be
to
get
ahead
of
it
in
the
race
and
it
could
never
overtake
the
falling
floor
see
it
clearly
said
lady
muriel
it
makes
one
dizzy
to
think
of
such
things
how
you
make
us
do
it
is
a
more
curious
idea
yet
i
ventured
to
say
a
cord
fastened
to
the
house
from
below
and
pulled
down
by
some
one
on
the
planet
then
of
course
the
goes
faster
than
its
natural
rate
of
falling
but
the
our
noble
go
on
falling
at
their
old
pace
and
would
therefore
be
left
we
should
rise
to
the
ceiling
said
the
earl
inevitable
result
of
which
would
be
concussion
of
avoid
that
said
arthur
us
have
the
furniture
fixed
to
the
floor
and
ourselves
tied
down
to
the
furniture
then
the
could
go
on
in
one
little
drawback
lady
muriel
gaily
interrupted
should
take
the
down
with
us
but
what
about
the
had
forgotten
the
arthur
confessed
no
doubt
would
rise
to
the
you
chose
to
drink
it
on
the
way
i
think
is
nonsense
enough
for
one
while
said
the
earl
news
does
this
gentleman
bring
us
from
the
great
world
of
london
this
drew
into
the
conversation
which
now
took
a
more
conventional
tone
after
a
while
arthur
gave
the
signal
for
our
departure
and
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
we
strolled
down
to
the
beach
enjoying
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
murmur
of
the
sea
and
the
music
of
some
song
almost
as
much
as
our
late
pleasant
talk
we
sat
down
among
the
rocks
by
a
little
pool
so
rich
in
animal
vegetable
and
whatever
is
the
right
that
i
became
entranced
in
the
study
of
it
and
when
arthur
proposed
returning
to
our
lodgings
i
begged
to
be
left
there
for
a
while
to
watch
and
muse
alone
the
song
grew
ever
nearer
and
clearer
as
their
boat
stood
in
for
the
beach
and
i
would
have
gone
down
to
see
them
land
their
cargo
of
fish
had
not
the
microcosm
at
my
feet
stirred
my
curiosity
yet
more
keenly
one
ancient
crab
that
was
for
ever
shuffling
frantically
from
side
to
side
of
the
pool
had
particularly
fascinated
me
there
was
a
vacancy
in
its
stare
and
an
aimless
violence
in
its
behaviour
that
irresistibly
recalled
the
gardener
who
had
befriended
sylvie
and
bruno
and
as
i
gazed
i
caught
the
concluding
notes
of
the
tune
of
his
crazy
song
the
silence
that
followed
was
broken
by
the
sweet
voice
of
sylvie
you
please
let
us
out
into
the
road
after
that
old
beggar
again
the
gardener
yelled
and
began
singing
thought
he
saw
a
kangaroo
that
worked
a
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
i
to
swallow
this
he
said
should
be
very
ill
want
him
to
swallow
sylvie
explained
not
hungry
but
we
want
to
see
him
so
will
you
illustration
thought
he
saw
a
the
gardener
promptly
replied
please
never
displeases
nobody
there
you
are
and
he
flung
the
door
open
and
let
us
out
upon
the
dusty
we
soon
found
our
way
to
the
bush
which
had
so
mysteriously
sunk
into
the
ground
and
here
sylvie
drew
the
magic
locket
from
its
turned
it
over
with
a
thoughtful
air
and
at
last
appealed
to
bruno
in
a
rather
helpless
way
it
we
had
to
do
with
it
bruno
all
gone
out
of
my
head
it
was
invariable
recipe
in
cases
of
doubt
and
difficulty
sylvie
kissed
it
but
no
result
followed
it
the
wrong
way
was
next
suggestion
the
wrong
way
sylvie
most
reasonably
enquired
the
obvious
plan
was
to
try
ways
rubbing
from
left
to
right
had
no
visible
effect
whatever
from
right
to
stop
sylvie
bruno
cried
in
sudden
alarm
going
to
happen
for
a
number
of
trees
on
the
neighbouring
hillside
were
moving
slowly
upwards
in
solemn
procession
while
a
mild
little
brook
that
had
been
rippling
at
our
feet
a
moment
before
began
to
swell
and
foam
and
hiss
and
bubble
in
a
truly
alarming
fashion
illustration
the
it
some
other
way
cried
bruno
quick
it
was
a
happy
thought
did
it
and
the
landscape
which
had
been
showing
signs
of
mental
aberration
in
various
directions
returned
to
its
normal
condition
of
the
exception
of
a
small
mouse
which
continued
to
run
wildly
up
and
down
the
road
lashing
its
tail
like
a
little
lion
follow
it
said
sylvie
and
this
also
turned
out
a
happy
thought
the
mouse
at
once
settled
down
into
a
with
which
we
could
easily
keep
pace
the
only
phenomenon
that
gave
me
any
uneasiness
was
the
rapid
increase
in
the
of
the
little
creature
we
were
following
which
became
every
moment
more
and
more
like
a
real
lion
soon
the
transformation
was
complete
and
a
noble
lion
stood
patiently
waiting
for
us
to
come
up
with
it
no
thought
of
fear
seemed
to
occur
to
the
children
who
patted
and
stroked
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
me
up
cried
bruno
and
in
another
moment
sylvie
had
lifted
him
upon
the
broad
back
of
the
gentle
beast
and
seated
herself
behind
him
bruno
took
a
good
handful
of
mane
in
each
hand
and
made
believe
to
guide
this
new
kind
of
steed
seemed
quite
sufficient
by
way
of
direction
the
lion
at
once
broke
into
an
easy
canter
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
i
say
for
i
am
certain
that
accompanied
i
managed
to
keep
up
with
a
cantering
lion
i
am
wholly
unable
to
explain
but
i
was
certainly
one
of
the
party
when
we
came
upon
an
old
cutting
sticks
at
whose
feet
the
lion
made
a
profound
obeisance
sylvie
and
bruno
at
the
same
moment
dismounting
and
leaping
into
the
arms
of
their
father
bad
to
worse
the
old
man
said
to
himself
dreamily
when
the
children
had
finished
their
rather
confused
account
of
the
visit
gathered
no
doubt
from
general
report
as
they
had
not
seen
him
themselves
bad
to
worse
that
is
their
destiny
i
see
it
but
i
can
not
alter
it
the
selfishness
of
a
mean
and
crafty
selfishness
of
an
ambitious
and
silly
selfishness
of
a
spiteful
and
loveless
tend
one
way
from
bad
to
worse
and
you
my
darlings
must
suffer
it
awhile
i
fear
yet
when
things
are
at
their
worst
you
can
come
to
me
i
can
do
but
little
as
gathering
up
a
handful
of
dust
and
scattering
it
in
the
air
he
slowly
and
solemnly
pronounced
some
words
that
sounded
like
a
charm
the
children
looking
on
in
silence

quenched
in

weakness

to
might
till
what
is
dark
be
light
till
what
is

right
the
cloud
of
dust
spread
itself
out
through
the
air
as
if
it
were
alive
forming
curious
shapes

were
for
ever
changing

hurried
indoors

in

blubbering

standing
by

bewildered

hung
his
hat
up
on

was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
too
much
astonished
by
the
sudden
change
of
scene
to
make
any
attempt
at
removing
it

it
came
down
to
his
shoulders

him
look
something
like
a
small
candle
with
a
large
extinguisher
over
it

mildly
explained

been
graciously
pleased

lessons

instant

unfortunate

across

sank

lifted
him
into

pinned

his

turned
to
the
scene

was

laughter

soon

flung
his
arms
round

raised

shriek

whether
he
received
the
threatened
kiss

not

was
unable
to
see
as
bruno

had
by
this
time
released
himself
from

extinguisher
rushed
headlong
out

in

had
begun
the
music
grew
fuller
and
richer
at
every
moment
other
manly
voices
joined
in
the
refrain
and
soon
i
heard
the
heavy
thud
that
told
me
the
boat
had
touched
the
beach
and
the
harsh
grating
of
the
shingle
as
the
men
dragged
it
up

roused
myself
and
after
lending
them
a
hand
in
hauling
up

lingered
yet
awhile

disembark

goodly
assortment
of

of

when
at
last
i
reached
our
lodgings
i
was
tired
and
sleepy
and
glad
enough
to
settle
down
again
into
the
while
arthur
hospitably
went
to
his
cupboard
to
get
me
out
some
cake
and
wine
without
which
he
declared
he
could
not
as
a
doctor
permit
my
going
to
bed

how
that
creak

surely
could
not
be

was
opening
and
shutting

often
moving
so
restlessly
about

soliloquy

figure
massive
and

door
opened
and
a
strange
man
entered
the
room
that
donkey
doing

said
to
himself
pausing
aghast
on
the
threshold
the
lady
thus
rudely
referred
to

had
got
one
of

cupboards
open
and
stood
with
her
back
to
him
smoothing
down
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
on
one
of
the
shelves
and
whispering
to
herself
so
deftly
done
craftily
contrived
her
loving
husband
stole
behind
her
on
tiptoe
and
tapped
her
on
the
head
he
playfully
shouted
at
her
ear
tell
me
again
i
say
to
a
goose
my
lady
wrung
her
hands
she
groaned

one
of
us

its
time

her
husband
testily
replied
dragging
out
the
sheet
of
brown
paper
are

hiding
here
my
lady
i
insist
upon
knowing
my
lady
cast
down
her
eyes
and
spoke
in
the
littlest
of
little
voices
make
fun
of
it
benjamin
she
pleaded
you
understand
a
dagger
for
sneered
his
excellency
only
got
to
make
people
dead
we
got
to
him
and
made
of
tin
too
he
snarled
contemptuously
bending
the
blade
round
his
thumb
madam
be
good
enough
to
explain
first
what
do
you
call
me
for
part
of
the
conspiracy
love
one
have
an
alias
you
an
is
it
well
and
next
what
did
you
get
this
dagger
for
come
no
evasions

deceive
got
it
the
detected
conspirator
stammered
trying
her
best
to
put
on
the
that
she
had
been
practising
at
the
madam
for
eighteenpence
if
you
know
dearest
what
i
got
it
for
on
say
your
word
and
honour
groaned
the
other
conspirator
they
worth
half
the
money
put
together
my
my
lady
concluded
in
a
meek
whisper
have
a
dagger
you
know
part
of
talk
of
conspiracies
her
husband
savagely
interrupted
as
he
tossed
the
dagger
into
the
cupboard
know
about
as
much
how
to
manage
a
conspiracy
as
if
you
were
a
chicken
why
the
first
thing
is
to
get
a
disguise
now
just
look
at
this
and
with
pardonable
pride
he
fitted
on
the
cap
and
bells
and
the
rest
of
the
dress
and
winked
at
her
and
put
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
the
sort
of
thing
now
he
demanded
my
eyes
flashed
with
all
a
enthusiasm
very
thing
she
exclaimed
clapping
her
hands
do
look
oh
such
a
fool
the
fool
smiled
a
doubtful
smile
he
was
not
quite
clear
whether
it
was
a
compliment
or
not
to
express
it
so
plainly
mean
a
jester
yes
what
i
intended
and
what
do
you
think
disguise
is
to
be
and
he
proceeded
to
unfold
the
parcel
the
lady
watching
him
in
rapture
how
lovely
she
cried
when
at
last
the
dress
was
unfolded
a
disguise
an
esquimaux
esquimaux
peasant
indeed
growled
the
other
put
it
on
and
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
why
a
you
use
your
eyes
he
checked
himself
suddenly
as
a
harsh
voice
yelled
through
the
room
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
bear
without
a
head
but
it
was
only
the
gardener
singing
under
the
open
window
the
stole
on
to
the
window
and
closed
it
noiselessly
before
he
ventured
to
go
on
lovey
a
but
not
without
a
i
hope
the
bear
and
me
the
keeper
and
if
any
one
knows
us
have
sharp
eyes
all
shall
have
to
practise
the
steps
a
bit
my
lady
said
looking
out
through
the
mouth
help
being
rather
human
just
at
first
you
know
and
of
course
say
up
bruin
you
of
course
replied
the
keeper
laying
hold
of
the
chain
that
hung
from
the
collar
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
cracked
a
little
whip
go
round
the
room
in
a
sort
of
a
dancing
attitude
very
good
my
dear
very
good
come
up
bruin
come
up
i
say
illustration
up
bruin
he
roared
out
the
last
words
for
the
benefit
of
uggug
who
had
just
come
into
the
room
and
was
now
standing
with
his
hands
spread
out
and
eyes
and
mouth
wide
open
the
very
picture
of
stupid
amazement
my
was
all
he
could
gasp
out
the
keeper
pretended
to
be
adjusting
the
collar
which
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
whispering
unheard
by
uggug
fault
afraid
quite
forgot
to
fasten
the
door
ruined
if
finds
it
out
keep
it
up
a
minute
or
two
longer
be
savage
then
while
seeming
to
pull
it
back
with
all
his
strength
he
let
it
advance
upon
the
scared
boy
my
lady
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
kept
up
what
she
no
doubt
intended
for
a
savage
growl
though
it
was
more
like
the
purring
of
a
cat
and
uggug
backed
out
of
the
room
with
such
haste
that
he
tripped
over
the
mat
and
was
heard
to
fall
heavily
accident
to
which
even
his
doting
mother
paid
no
heed
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
the
shut
and
bolted
the
door
with
the
disguises
he
panted
not
a
moment
to
lose
sure
to
fetch
the
professor
and
we
take
in
you
know
and
in
another
minute
the
disguises
were
stowed
away
in
the
cupboard
the
door
unbolted
and
the
two
conspirators
seated
lovingly
on
the
sofa
earnestly
discussing
a
book
the
had
hastily
snatched
off
the
table
which
proved
to
be
the
of
the
capital
of
outland
the
door
opened
very
slowly
and
cautiously
and
the
professor
peeped
in
stupid
face
being
just
visible
behind
him
is
a
beautiful
arrangement
the
was
saying
with
enthusiasm
see
my
precious
one
that
there
are
fifteen
houses
in
green
street
you
turn
into
west
houses
is
it
my
lady
replied
thought
it
was
fourteen
and
so
intent
were
they
on
this
interesting
question
that
neither
of
them
even
looked
up
till
the
professor
leading
uggug
by
the
hand
stood
close
before
them
my
lady
was
the
first
to
notice
their
approach
the
professor
she
exclaimed
in
her
blandest
tones
my
precious
child
too
are
lessons
over
strange
thing
has
happened
the
professor
began
in
a
trembling
tone
exalted
this
was
one
of
many
titles
me
he
has
just
seen
in
this
very
room
a
and
a
the
and
his
wife
shook
with
merriment
in
room
darling
said
the
fond
mother
been
sitting
here
this
hour
or
more
here
she
referred
to
the
book
lying
on
her
lap
me
feel
your
pulse
my
boy
said
the
anxious
father
put
out
your
tongue
ah
i
thought
so
a
little
feverish
professor
and
has
had
a
bad
dream
put
him
to
bed
at
once
and
give
him
a
cooling
been
dreaming
his
exalted
fatness
remonstrated
as
the
professor
led
him
away
grammar
sir
his
father
remarked
with
some
sternness
attend
to
little
matter
professor
as
soon
as
you
have
corrected
the
feverishness
and
by
the
way
professor
the
professor
left
his
distinguished
pupil
standing
at
the
door
and
meekly
returned
is
a
rumour
afloat
that
the
people
wish
to
elect
point
of
fact
understand
that
i
mean
the
poor
old
man
exclaimed
in
horror
certainly
not
the
eagerly
explained
an
you
cried
the
astonished
professor
holding
his
head
between
his
hands
as
if
he
expected
it
to
come
to
pieces
with
the
shock
will
the
the
will
most
likely
the
new
emperor
my
lady
explained
could
we
find
a
better
unless
she
glanced
at
her
husband
indeed
the
professor
fervently
responded
quite
failing
to
take
the
hint
the
resumed
the
thread
of
his
discourse
reason
i
mentioned
it
professor
was
to
ask
to
be
so
kind
as
to
preside
at
the
election
you
see
it
would
make
the
thing
suspicion
of
anything
fear
i
your
excellency
the
old
man
faltered
will
the
true
the
interrupted
position
as
makes
it
awkward
i
admit
well
well
then
the
election
shall
be
held
without
so
than
if
it
were
held
me
the
professor
murmured
with
a
bewildered
air
as
if
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
i
think
your
highness
said
and
a
and
he
wandered
dreamily
back
to
where
uggug
sulkily
awaited
him
i
followed
them
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
passage
the
professor
murmuring
to
himself
all
the
time
as
a
kind
of
aid
to
his
feeble
memory
c
c
couch
till
in
turning
a
corner
he
met
sylvie
and
bruno
so
suddenly
that
the
startled
professor
let
go
of
his
fat
pupil
who
instantly
took
to
his
heels
chapter
x
the
other
professor
were
looking
for
you
cried
sylvie
in
a
tone
of
great
relief
want
you
so
much
you
think
is
it
dear
children
the
professor
asked
beaming
on
them
with
a
very
different
look
from
what
uggug
ever
got
from
him
want
you
to
speak
to
the
gardener
for
us
sylvie
said
as
she
and
bruno
took
the
old
hands
and
led
him
into
the
hall
ever
so
unkind
bruno
mournfully
added
unkind
to
us
now
that
gone
the
lion
were
nicer
you
must
explain
to
me
please
the
professor
said
with
an
anxious
look
is
the
lion
and
is
the
gardener
important
not
to
get
two
such
animals
confused
together
and
very
liable
to
do
it
in
their
having
mouths
you
oo
confuses
two
animals
together
bruno
asked
often
afraid
the
professor
candidly
confessed
for
instance
the
and
the
the
professor
pointed
them
out
gets
a
little
confused
with
having
doors
you
know
now
only
you
believe
it
put
some
lettuces
into
the
clock
and
tried
to
wind
up
the
rabbit
the
rabbit
after
oo
wounded
it
up
said
bruno
the
professor
clasped
his
hands
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
groaned
i
should
think
it
go
why
and
where
ever
gone
what
i
find
out
done
my
read
all
the
article
in
the
great
come
in
the
tailor
sir
with
your
little
bill
said
a
meek
voice
outside
the
door
well
i
can
soon
settle
business
the
professor
said
to
the
children
just
wait
a
minute
how
much
is
it
this
year
my
man
the
tailor
had
come
in
while
he
was
speaking
been
a
doubling
so
many
years
you
see
the
tailor
replied
a
little
gruffly
i
think
like
the
money
now
two
thousand
pound
it
is
nothing
the
professor
carelessly
remarked
feeling
in
his
pocket
as
if
he
always
carried
at
least
amount
about
with
him
you
like
to
wait
just
another
year
and
make
it
thousand
just
think
how
rich
be
why
you
might
be
a
if
you
liked
know
as
care
about
being
a
the
man
said
thoughtfully
it
sound
a
powerful
sight
money
well
i
think
course
you
will
said
the
professor
good
sense
in
i
see
to
you
my
man
you
ever
have
to
pay
him
that
four
thousand
pounds
sylvie
asked
as
the
door
closed
on
the
departing
creditor
my
child
the
professor
replied
emphatically
go
on
doubling
it
till
he
dies
you
see
worth
while
waiting
another
year
to
get
twice
as
much
money
and
now
what
would
you
like
to
do
my
little
friends
shall
i
take
you
to
see
the
other
professor
this
would
be
an
excellent
opportunity
for
a
visit
he
said
to
himself
glancing
at
his
watch
generally
takes
a
short
fourteen
minutes
and
a
this
bruno
hastily
went
round
to
sylvie
who
was
standing
at
the
other
side
of
the
professor
and
put
his
hand
into
hers
like
to
go
he
said
doubtfully
please
go
all
together
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
oo
know
you
talk
as
if
you
were
exclaimed
the
professor
know
i
did
bruno
replied
very
humbly
quite
forgotted
i
sylvie
only
i
fought
he
might
be
rarver
fierce
the
professor
laughed
a
jolly
laugh
quite
tame
he
said
never
bites
only
a
little
you
he
took
hold
of
other
hand
and
led
the
children
down
a
long
passage
i
had
never
noticed
that
there
was
anything
remarkable
in
i
was
constantly
coming
on
new
rooms
and
passages
in
that
mysterious
palace
and
very
seldom
succeeded
in
finding
the
old
ones
again
near
the
end
of
the
passage
the
professor
stopped
is
his
room
he
said
pointing
to
the
solid
wall
get
in
through
bruno
exclaimed
sylvie
said
nothing
till
she
had
carefully
examined
whether
the
wall
opened
anywhere
then
she
laughed
merrily
playing
us
a
trick
you
dear
old
thing
she
said
no
here
any
door
to
the
room
said
the
professor
shall
have
to
climb
in
at
the
illustration
the
other
professor
so
we
went
into
the
garden
and
soon
found
the
window
of
the
other
room
it
was
a
window
and
stood
invitingly
open
the
professor
first
lifted
the
two
children
in
and
then
he
and
i
climbed
in
after
them
the
other
professor
was
seated
at
a
table
with
a
large
book
open
before
him
on
which
his
forehead
was
resting
he
had
clasped
his
arms
round
the
book
and
was
snoring
heavily
usually
reads
like
that
the
professor
remarked
the
very
interesting
and
then
sometimes
very
difficult
to
get
him
to
attend
this
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
difficult
times
the
professor
lifted
him
up
once
or
twice
and
shook
him
violently
but
he
always
returned
to
his
book
the
moment
he
was
let
go
of
and
showed
by
his
heavy
breathing
that
the
book
was
as
interesting
as
ever
dreamy
he
is
the
professor
exclaimed
must
have
got
to
a
interesting
part
of
the
book
and
he
rained
quite
a
shower
of
thumps
on
the
other
back
shouting
hoy
all
the
time
it
that
he
should
be
so
dreamy
he
said
to
bruno
always
as
as
that
bruno
remarked
dreamy
what
are
we
to
said
the
professor
see
quite
wrapped
up
in
the
book
oo
the
book
bruno
suggested
it
cried
the
delighted
professor
course
do
it
and
he
shut
up
the
book
so
quickly
that
he
caught
the
other
nose
between
the
leaves
and
gave
it
a
severe
pinch
the
other
professor
instantly
rose
to
his
feet
and
carried
the
book
away
to
the
end
of
the
room
where
he
put
it
back
in
its
place
in
the
been
reading
for
eighteen
hours
and
he
said
now
i
shall
rest
for
fourteen
minutes
and
a
half
is
the
lecture
all
ready
nearly
the
professor
humbly
replied
shall
ask
you
to
give
me
a
hint
or
will
be
a
few
little
a
banquet
i
think
you
said
yes
the
banquet
comes
of
course
people
never
enjoy
abstract
science
you
know
when
ravenous
with
hunger
and
then
the
oh
be
lots
of
entertainment
will
the
ball
come
in
said
the
other
professor
it
had
better
come
at
the
beginning
of
the
brings
people
together
so
nicely
you
the
right
order
first
the
meeting
then
the
eating
then
the
sure
any
lecture
give
us
will
be
a
treat
said
the
other
professor
who
had
been
standing
with
his
back
to
us
all
this
time
occupying
himself
in
taking
the
books
out
one
by
one
and
turning
them
an
easel
with
a
black
board
on
it
stood
near
him
and
every
time
that
he
turned
a
book
he
made
a
mark
on
the
board
with
a
piece
of
chalk
as
to
the
have
so
kindly
promised
to
give
the
professor
went
on
thoughtfully
rubbing
his
chin
think
that
had
better
come
at
the
of
the
banquet
then
people
can
listen
to
it
i
it
the
other
professor
asked
with
a
smile
of
delight
you
the
professor
replied
cautiously
me
try
said
the
other
professor
seating
himself
at
the
pianoforte
the
sake
of
argument
let
us
assume
that
it
begins
on
a
and
he
struck
the
note
in
question
la
la
i
think
within
an
octave
of
he
struck
the
note
again
and
appealed
to
bruno
who
was
standing
at
his
side
i
sing
it
like
my
child
oo
bruno
replied
with
great
decision
were
more
like
a
notes
are
apt
to
have
that
effect
the
other
professor
said
with
a
sigh
me
try
a
whole
verse
there
was
a
pig
that
sat
alone
beside
a
ruined
pump
by
day
and
night
he
made
his
moan
it
would
have
stirred
a
heart
of
stone
to
see
him
wring
his
hoofs
and
groan
because
he
could
not
jump
would
you
call
that
a
tune
professor
he
asked
when
he
had
finished
the
professor
considered
a
little
he
said
at
last
of
the
notes
are
the
same
as
some
are
i
should
hardly
call
it
a
me
try
it
a
bit
by
myself
said
the
other
professor
and
he
began
touching
the
notes
here
and
there
and
humming
to
himself
like
an
angry
bluebottle
do
you
like
his
singing
the
professor
asked
the
children
in
a
low
voice
very
sylvie
said
hesitatingly
very
extremely
bruno
said
without
any
hesitation
at
all
extremes
are
bad
the
professor
said
very
gravely
instance
sobriety
is
a
very
good
thing
when
practised
but
even
sobriety
when
carried
to
an
has
its
are
its
disadvantages
was
the
question
that
rose
in
my
as
usual
bruno
asked
it
for
me
its
lizard
bandages
this
is
of
them
said
the
professor
a
tipsy
one
extreme
you
know
he
sees
one
thing
as
two
but
when
sober
the
other
extreme
he
sees
two
things
as
one
equally
inconvenient
whichever
does
mean
bruno
whispered
to
sylvie
difference
between
and
is
best
explained
by
an
example
said
the
other
professor
who
had
overheard
the
question
just
think
over
any
poem
that
contains
the
two
the
professor
put
his
hands
over
his
ears
with
a
look
of
dismay
you
once
let
him
begin
a
he
said
to
sylvie
never
leave
off
again
he
never
does
he
ever
begin
a
poem
and
not
leave
off
again
sylvie
enquired
times
said
the
professor
bruno
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
till
his
lips
were
on
a
level
with
ear
became
of
them
three
poems
he
whispered
he
saying
them
all
now
said
sylvie
other
professor
is
speaking
say
it
very
quick
murmured
the
other
professor
with
downcast
eyes
and
melancholy
voice
which
contrasted
oddly
with
his
face
as
he
had
forgotten
to
leave
off
smiling
least
it
exactly
a
as
sylvie
said
afterwards
looked
as
if
his
mouth
was
made
that
on
then
said
the
professor
must
be
must
that
sylvie
whispered
to
bruno
a
very
good
rule
for
whenever
you
hurt
a
very
good
rule
for
whenever
i
make
a
noise
said
the
saucy
little
fellow
remember
it
too
miss
you
mean
said
sylvie
trying
to
frown
a
thing
she
never
managed
particularly
well
and
oftens
said
bruno
oo
told
me
be
so
much
noise
bruno
when
tolded
oo
why
there
no
rules
at
all
about
but
oo
never
believes
if
any
one
believe
you
wicked
wicked
boy
said
sylvie
the
were
severe
enough
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
when
you
are
really
to
impress
a
criminal
with
a
sense
of
his
guilt
you
ought
not
to
pronounce
the
sentence
with
your
lips
close
to
his
a
kiss
at
the
end
of
it
however
accidental
weakens
the
effect
terribly
chapter
xi
peter
and
paul
i
was
saying
the
other
professor
resumed
just
think
over
any
poem
that
contains
the
as
is
poor
said
noble
paul
i
have
always
been
his
friend
and
though
my
means
to
give
are
small
at
least
i
can
afford
to
how
few
in
this
cold
age
of
greed
do
good
except
on
selfish
grounds
but
i
can
feel
for
need
and
will
lend
him
fifty
how
great
was
joy
to
find
his
friend
in
such
a
genial
vein
how
cheerfully
the
bond
he
signed
to
pay
the
money
back
again
said
paul
too
precise
best
to
fix
the
very
day
so
by
a
learned
advice
made
it
noon
the
fourth
of
illustration
cheerfully
the
bond
he
signed
this
is
april
peter
said
first
of
april
as
i
think
five
little
weeks
will
soon
be
fled
one
scarcely
will
have
time
to
wink
give
me
a
year
to
to
buy
and
drive

paul
can
not
change
the

the
fourth

must
be
well
said
peter
with
a
sigh
me
the
cash
and
i
will
go
form
a
company
and
turn
an
honest
pound
or
grieved
said
paul
seem
unkind
the
money
shall
of
course
be
lent
but
for
a
week
or
two
i
find
it
will
not
be
so
week
by
week
poor
peter
came
and
turned
in
heaviness
away
for
still
the
answer
was
the
same
can
not
manage
it
and
now
the
april
showers
were
the
five
short
weeks
were
nearly
yet
still
he
got
the
old
reply
is
not
quite
convenient
the
fourth
arrived
and
punctual
paul
came
with
his
legal
friend
at
noon
thought
it
best
said
he
call
one
can
not
settle
things
too
poor
peter
shuddered
in
despair
his
flowing
locks
he
wildly
tore
and
very
soon
his
yellow
hair
was
lying
all
about
the
floor
the
legal
friend
was
standing
by
with
sudden
pity
half
unmanned
the
trembled
in
his
eye
the
signed
agreement
in
his
hand
but
when
at
length
the
legal
soul
resumed
its
customary
force
law
he
said
control
pay
or
the
law
must
take
its
course
said
paul
bitterly
i
rue
that
fatal
morning
when
i
called
consider
peter
what
you
do
you
be
richer
when
bald
think
you
by
rending
curls
away
to
make
your
difficulties
less
forbear
this
violence
i
pray
you
do
but
add
to
my
distress
illustration
peter
shuddered
in
willingly
would
i
inflict
said
peter
that
noble
heart
one
needless
pang
yet
why
so
strict
is
to
act
a
friendly
part
however
legal
it
may
be
to
pay
what
never
has
been
lent
this
style
of
business
seems
to
me
extremely
inconvenient
nobleness
of
soul
have
i
like
that
in
this
age
are
found
paul
blushed
in
sheer
humility
and
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
debt
will
simply
swallow
all
and
make
my
life
a
life
of
woe
nay
my
peter
answered
paul
must
not
rail
on
fortune
so
have
enough
to
eat
and
drink
you
are
respected
in
the
world
and
at
the
as
i
think
you
often
get
your
whiskers
curled
though
nobleness
you
to
any
very
great
the
path
of
honesty
is
plain
however
inconvenient
true
said
peter
alive
i
keep
my
station
in
the
world
once
in
the
week
i
just
contrive
to
get
my
whiskers
oiled
and
curled
but
my
assets
are
very
low
my
little
overspent
to
trench
on
capital
you
know
is
always
inconvenient
pay
your
debts
cried
honest
paul
gentle
peter
pay
your
debts
what
matter
if
it
swallows
all
that
you
describe
as
your
already
an
hour
behind
yet
generosity
is
best
it
pinches
never
mind
will
not
charge
you
interest
good
how
great
poor
peter
cried
i
must
sell
my
sunday
the
that
has
been
my
my
grand
my
pig
full
soon
his
property
took
wings
and
daily
as
each
treasure
went
he
sighed
to
find
the
state
of
things
grow
less
and
less
convenient
weeks
grew
to
months
and
months
to
years
peter
was
worn
to
skin
and
bone
and
once
he
even
said
with
tears
paul
that
promised
loan
said
paul
lend
you
when
i
can
all
the
spare
money
i
have
ah
peter
a
happy
man
yours
is
an
enviable
lot
illustration
boots
as
these
you
seldom
getting
stout
as
you
may
see
it
is
but
seldom
i
am
well
i
can
not
feel
my
ancient
glee
in
listening
to
the
but
you
you
gambol
like
a
boy
your
figure
is
so
spare
and
light
the
a
note
of
joy
to
such
a
healthy
appetite
said
peter
am
well
aware
mine
is
a
state
of
happiness
and
yet
how
gladly
could
i
spare
some
of
the
comforts
i
possess
what
call
healthy
appetite
feel
as
savage
tooth
and
when
no
dinner
is
in
sight
the
a
sound
of
ruth
would
accept
this
coat
such
boots
as
these
you
seldom
see
ah
paul
a
single
would
make
another
man
of
me
said
paul
fills
me
with
surprise
to
hear
you
talk
in
such
a
tone
i
fear
you
scarcely
realise
the
blessings
that
are
all
your
own
safe
from
being
overfed
sweetly
picturesque
in
rags
you
never
know
the
aching
head
that
comes
along
with
and
you
have
time
to
cultivate
that
best
of
qualities
for
which
find
your
present
state
remarkably
convenient
said
peter
i
can
not
sound
the
depths
of
such
a
man
as
you
yet
in
your
character
found
an
inconsistency
or
two
you
seem
to
have
long
years
to
spare
when
a
promise
to
fulfil
and
yet
how
punctual
you
were
in
calling
with
that
little
bill
be
too
deliberate
said
paul
parting
with
pelf
with
bills
as
you
correctly
state
punctuality
itself
a
man
may
surely
claim
his
dues
but
when
money
to
be
a
man
must
be
allowed
to
choose
such
times
as
are
convenient
it
chanced
one
day
as
peter
sat
gnawing
a
usual
paul
bustled
in
to
have
a
chat
and
grasped
his
hand
with
friendly
zeal
knew
said
he
frugal
ways
so
that
i
might
not
wound
your
pride
by
bringing
strangers
in
to
gaze
left
my
legal
friend
outside
well
remember
i
am
sure
when
first
your
wealth
began
to
go
and
people
sneered
at
one
so
poor
never
used
my
peter
so
and
when
lost
your
little
all
and
found
yourself
a
thing
despised
i
need
not
ask
you
to
recall
how
tenderly
i
sympathised
the
advice
poured
on
you
so
full
of
wisdom
and
of
wit
all
given
gratis
though
true
i
might
have
fairly
charged
for
it
but
i
refrain
from
mentioning
full
many
a
deed
i
might
for
boasting
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
i
particularly
hate

lend
you
fifty

of
all
the
kindnesses
done
from
years
down
to

fifty
pounds

little
guessed
how
deep
it
drained
my
slender
store
but

this
breast

will
lend
you
fifty

was
mild
reply
his
cheeks
all
wet
with
grateful
tears
man
recalls
so
well
as
i
your
services
in
bygone
years
and
this
new
offer
i
admit
is
very
very
kindly
still
to
avail
myself
of
it
would
not
be
quite
convenient

in
a
moment
what
the
difference
is
between

you
quite
understand
it
now

he
added
looking
kindly
at
bruno
who
was
sitting
at
side
on
the
floor
said
bruno
very
quietly
such
a
short
speech
was
very
unusual
for
him
but
just
then
he
seemed
i
fancied
a
little
exhausted
in
fact
he
climbed
up
into
lap
as
he
spoke
and
rested
his
head
against
her
shoulder
a
many
verses
it
was

whispered

a
musical
gardener
the
other
professor
regarded
him
with
some
anxiety
smaller
animal
ought
to
go
to
bed
he
said
with
an
air
of
authority
said
the
professor
he
go
at
twice
said
the
other
professor
the
professor
gently
clapped
his
hands
he
he
said
to
sylvie
else
could
have
thought
of
the
reason
so
quick
why
he
go
at
twice
it
would
hurt
him
to
be
this
remark
woke
up
bruno
suddenly
and
completely
want
to
be
he
said
decisively
does
very
well
on
a
said
the
other
professor
could
show
it
you
in
a
minute
only
the
a
little
care
sylvie
anxiously
exclaimed
as
he
began
rather
clumsily
to
point
it
cut
your
finger
off
if
you
hold
the
knife
so
oo
cuts
it
off
will
oo
give
it
to
please
bruno
thoughtfully
added
like
this
said
the
other
professor
hastily
drawing
a
long
line
upon
the
black
board
and
marking
the
letters
at
the
two
ends
and
in
the
middle
me
explain
it
to
you
if
were
to
be
divided
into
two
parts
at
would
be
drownded
bruno
pronounced
confidently
the
other
professor
gasped
would
be
drownded
the
of
course
said
bruno
the
two
bits
would
sink
down
in
the
sea
here
the
professor
interfered
as
the
other
professor
was
evidently
too
much
puzzled
to
go
on
with
his
diagram
i
said
it
would
him
i
was
merely
referring
to
the
action
of
the
the
other
professor
brightened
up
in
a
moment
action
of
the
nerves
he
began
eagerly
curiously
slow
in
some
people
i
had
a
friend
once
that
if
you
burnt
him
with
a
poker
it
would
take
years
and
years
before
he
felt
it
if
you
only
him
queried
sylvie
it
would
take
ever
so
much
longer
of
course
in
fact
i
doubt
if
the
man
would
ever
feel
it
at
all
his
grandchildren
like
to
be
the
grandchild
of
a
pinched
grandfather
would
mister
sir
bruno
whispered
might
come
just
when
you
wanted
to
be
happy
that
would
be
awkward
i
admitted
taking
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
that
he
had
so
suddenly
caught
sight
of
me
you
want
to
be
happy
bruno
bruno
said
thoughtfully
when
happy
i
wants
to
be
a
little
miserable
then
i
just
tell
sylvie
about
it
oo
know
and
sylvie
sets
me
some
lessons
then
all
sorry
you
like
lessons
i
said
should
copy
sylvie
always
as
busy
as
the
day
is
long
so
am
said
bruno
no
sylvie
corrected
him
as
busy
as
the
day
is
the
difference
bruno
asked
sir
the
day
as
short
as
long
i
mean
it
the
length
never
having
considered
the
question
in
this
light
i
suggested
that
they
had
better
ask
the
professor
and
they
ran
off
in
a
moment
to
appeal
to
their
old
friend
the
professor
left
off
polishing
his
spectacles
to
consider
dears
he
said
after
a
minute
day
is
the
same
length
as
anything
that
is
the
same
length
as
and
he
resumed
his
neverending
task
of
polishing
the
children
returned
slowly
and
thoughtfully
to
report
his
answer
he
wise
sylvie
asked
in
an
awestruck
whisper
was
as
wise
as
i
should
have
a
all
day
long
i
i
should
appear
to
be
talking
to
here
the
professor
said
turning
round
to
the
children
is
it
bruno
looked
puzzled
never
talks
to
nobody
when
he
here
he
replied
good
manners
oo
should
always
wait
till
he
comes
before
oo
talks
to
him
the
professor
looked
anxiously
in
my
direction
and
seemed
to
look
through
and
through
me
without
seeing
me
who
are
you
talking
to
he
said
anybody
here
you
know
except
the
other
here
he
added
wildly
turning
round
and
round
like
a
teetotum
help
to
look
for
him
quick
got
lost
again
the
children
were
on
their
feet
in
a
moment
shall
we
look
said
sylvie
shouted
the
excited
professor
be
quick
about
it
and
he
began
trotting
round
and
round
the
room
lifting
up
the
chairs
and
shaking
them
bruno
took
a
very
small
book
out
of
the
bookcase
opened
it
and
shook
it
in
imitation
of
the
professor
he
said
be
there
bruno
sylvie
said
indignantly
he
said
bruno
should
have
shooked
him
out
if
been
in
there
he
ever
been
lost
before
sylvie
enquired
turning
up
a
corner
of
the
and
peeping
under
it
before
said
the
professor
once
lost
himself
in
a
he
find
again
said
bruno
he
shout
be
sure
to
hear
he
be
far
off
oo
try
shouting
said
the
professor
shall
we
shout
said
sylvie
second
thoughts
shout
the
professor
replied
might
hear
you
getting
awfully
strict
this
reminded
the
poor
children
of
all
the
troubles
about
which
they
had
come
to
their
old
friend
bruno
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
began
crying
so
cruel
he
sobbed
he
lets
uggug
take
away
my
toys
and
such
horrid
meals
did
you
have
for
dinner
said
the
professor
little
piece
of
a
dead
crow
was
mournful

sylvie
explained
a
dead
crow
bruno
persisted
there
were
a
uggug
ate
it
i
got
nuffin
but
a
crust
and
i
asked
for
a
get
it
and
the
poor
little
fellow
buried
his
face
in
lap
who
kept
gently
stroking
his
hair
as
she
went
on
all
true
professor
dear
they
treat
my
darling
bruno
very
badly
and
not
kind
to
either
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
as
if
were
a
thing
of
much
less
importance
the
professor
got
out
a
large
red
silk
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
eyes
wish
i
could
help
you
dear
children
he
said
what
i
do
know
the
way
to
well
said
sylvie
only
the
gardener
would
let
us
he
open
the
door
for
you
said
the
professor
for

sylvie
sure
he
would
for
do
come
and
ask
him

minute

the
professor

up
and
dried
his
eyes

the
professor
took
no
notice
of
my
remark
he
had
put
on
a
beautiful
cap
with
a
long
tassel
and
was
selecting
one
of
the
other
from
a
stand
in
the
corner
of
the
room
thick
stick
in
hand
makes
people
respectful
he
was
saying
to
himself
along
dear
children
and
we
all
went
out
into
the
garden
together
shall
address
him
first
of
all
the
professor
explained
as
we
went
along
a
few
playful
remarks
on
the
weather
i
shall
then
question
him
about
the
other
professor
this
will
have
a
double
advantage
first
it
will
open
the
conversation
you
even
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
without
opening
it
first
and
secondly
if
seen
the
other
professor
we
shall
find
him
that
way
and
if
he
we
on
our
way
we
passed
the
target
at
which
uggug
had
been
made
to
shoot
during
the
visit
said
the
professor
pointing
out
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
imperial
fatness
had
only
shot
at
it
and
he
went
in
just
bruno
carefully
examined
the
hole
go
in
he
whispered
to
me
are
too
we
had
no
sort
of
difficulty
in
the
gardener
though
he
was
hidden
from
us
by
some
trees
that
harsh
voice
of
his
served
to
direct
us
and
as
we
drew
nearer
the
words
of
his
song
became
more
and
more
plainly
audible
thought
he
saw
an
albatross
that
fluttered
round
the
lamp
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
best
be
getting
home
he
said
nights
are
very
damp
illustration
thought
he
saw
an
it
be
afraid
of
catching
cold
said
bruno
it
got
damp
sylvie
suggested
might
stick
to
something
you
somefin
would
have
to
go
by
the
post
whatever
it
was
bruno
eagerly
exclaimed
it
was
a
cow
it
be
for
the
other
things
all
these
things
happened
to
said
the
professor
what
makes
the
song
so
must
have
had
a
very
curious
life
said
sylvie
may
say
that
the
professor
heartily
rejoined
course
she
may
cried
bruno
by
this
time
we
had
come
up
to
the
gardener
who
was
standing
on
one
leg
as
usual
and
busily
employed
in
watering
a
bed
of
flowers
with
an
empty
got
no
water
in
it
bruno
explained
to
him
pulling
his
sleeve
to
attract
his
attention
lighter
to
hold
said
the
gardener
lot
of
water
in
it
makes
arms
and
he
went
on
with
his
work
singing
softly
to
himself
nights
are
very
damp
digging
things
out
of
the
you
probably
do
now
and
then
the
professor
began
in
a
loud
voice
making
things
into
no
doubt
you
often
do
and
in
kicking
things
about
with
one
you
seem
never
to
leave
off
doing
have
you
ever
happened
to
notice
another
professor
something
like
me
but
different
shouted
the
gardener
so
loudly
and
violently
that
we
all
drew
back
in
alarm
such
a
thing
will
try
a
less
exciting
topic
the
professor
mildly
remarked
to
the
children
were
asked
him
to
let
us
through
the
said
sylvie
he
but
perhaps
he
would
for
the
professor
put
the
request
very
humbly
and
courteously
mind
letting
out
said
the
gardener
i
open
the
door
for
think
disobey
the
not
for
the
professor
cautiously
produced
a
couple
of
shillings
do
it
the
gardener
shouted
as
he
hurled
the
across
the
and
produced
a
handful
of
large
one
and
a
number
of
small
ones
look
here
professor
dear
whispered
sylvie
open
the
door
for
at
all
we
can
go
out
with
dear
child
the
professor
thankfully
replied
as
he
replaced
the
coins
in
his
pocket
saves
two
shillings
and
he
took
the
hands
that
they
might
all
go
out
together
when
the
door
was
opened
this
however
did
not
seem
a
very
likely
event
though
the
gardener
patiently
tried
all
the
small
keys
over
and
over
again
at
last
the
professor
ventured
on
a
gentle
suggestion
not
try
the
one
i
have
often
observed
that
a
door
unlocks
more
nicely
with
its
the
very
first
trial
of
the
large
key
proved
a
success
the
gardener
opened
the
door
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
money
the
professor
shook
his
head
are
acting
by
he
explained
opening
the
door
for
and
now
open
we
are
going
out
by
rule
of
the
gardener
looked
puzzled
and
let
us
go
out
but
as
he
locked
the
door
behind
us
we
heard
him
singing
thoughtfully
to
himself
thought
he
saw
a
that
opened
with
a
key
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
double
rule
of
three
all
its
mystery
he
said
clear
as
day
to
me
shall
now
return
said
the
professor
when
we
had
walked
a
few
yards
see
impossible
to
read
for
all
my
books
are
in
the
but
the
children
still
kept
fast
hold
of
his
hands
come
with
us
sylvie
entreated
with
tears
in
her
eyes
well
said
the
old
man
come
after
you
some
day
soon
but
i
go
back
you
see
i
left
off
at
a
comma
and
so
awkward
not
knowing
how
the
sentence
finishes
besides
got
to
go
through
dogland
first
and
always
a
little
nervous
about
dogs
but
be
quite
easy
to
come
as
soon
as
completed
my
new
carrying
you
know
it
wants
just
a
more
that
be
very
tiring
to
carry
sylvie
enquired
no
my
child
you
see
whatever
fatigue
one
incurs
by
one
saves
by
dears
sir
he
added
to
my
intense
surprise
giving
my
hand
an
affectionate
squeeze
professor
i
replied
but
my
voice
sounded
strange
and
far
away
and
the
children
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
our
farewell
evidently
they
neither
saw
me
nor
heard
me
as
with
their
arms
lovingly
twined
round
each
other
they
marched
boldly
on
chapter
xiii
a
visit
to
dogland
a
house
away
there
to
the
left
said
sylvie
after
we
had
walked
what
seemed
to
me
about
fifty
miles
go
and
ask
for
a
looks
a
very
comfable
house
bruno
said
as
we
turned
into
the
road
leading
up
to
it
doos
hope
the
dogs
will
be
kind
to
us
i
so
tired
and
hungry
a
mastiff
dressed
in
a
scarlet
collar
and
carrying
a
musket
was
pacing
up
and
down
like
a
sentinel
in
front
of
the
entrance
he
started
on
catching
sight
of
the
children
and
came
forwards
to
meet
them
keeping
his
musket
pointed
straight
at
bruno
who
stood
quite
still
though
he
turned
pale
and
kept
tight
hold
of
hand
while
the
sentinel
walked
solemnly
round
and
round
them
and
looked
at
them
from
all
points
of
view
illustration
the
hooh
boohooyah
he
growled
at
last
yahwah
oobooh
bow
wahbah
woobooyah
bow
wow
he
asked
bruno
severely
of
course
understood
all
this
easily
enough
all
fairies
understand
is
but
as
may
find
it
a
little
difficult
just
at
first
i
had
better
put
it
into
english
for
you
i
verily
believe
a
couple
of
stray
humans
what
dog
do
you
belong
to
what
do
you
want
belong
to
a
bruno
began
in
doggee
belongs
to
dogs
he
whispered
to
sylvie
but
sylvie
hastily
checked
him
for
fear
of
hurting
the
feelings
we
want
a
little
food
and
a
room
in
the
house
she
added
timidly
sylvie
spoke
doggee
very
prettily
but
i
think
almost
better
for
to
give
the
conversation
in
english
indeed
growled
the
sentinel
you
never
seen
a
in
your
life
come
along
with
me
his
majesty
must
settle
to
be
done
with
they
followed
him
through
the
down
a
long
passage
and
into
a
magnificent
saloon
around
which
were
grouped
dogs
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
two
splendid
were
solemnly
sitting
up
one
on
each
side
of
the
two
or
three
i
guessed
to
be
the
of
the
waiting
in
grim
silence
in
fact
the
only
voices
at
all
plainly
audible
were
those
of
two
little
dogs
who
had
mounted
a
settee
and
were
holding
a
lively
discussion
that
looked
very
like
a
quarrel
and
ladies
in
waiting
and
various
court
officials
our
guide
gruffly
remarked
as
he
led
us
in
of
the
courtiers
took
no
notice
whatever
but
sylvie
and
bruno
were
the
subject
of
many
inquisitive
looks
and
many
whispered
remarks
of
which
i
only
distinctly
caught
by
a
dachshund
to
his
wooh
wahyah
hoobah
oobooh
bah
not
such
a
human
she
leaving
the
new
arrivals
in
the
centre
of
the
saloon
the
sentinel
advanced
to
a
door
at
the
further
end
of
it
which
bore
an
inscription
painted
on
it
in
doggee
and
before
doing
this
the
sentinel
turned
to
the
children
and
said
me
your
rather
not
bruno
exclaimed
pulling
sylvie
away
from
the
door
want
them
ourselves
come
back
sylvie
come
quick
said
sylvie
very
decidedly
and
gave
their
names
in
doggee
then
the
sentinel
scratched
violently
at
the
door
and
gave
a
yell
that
made
bruno
shiver
from
head
to
foot
wah
said
a
deep
voice
inside
doggee
for
in
the
king
himself
the
mastiff
whispered
in
an
awestruck
tone
off
your
wigs
and
lay
them
humbly
at
his
what
should
call
his
sylvie
was
just
going
to
explain
very
politely
that
really
they
perform
ceremony
because
their
wigs
come
off
when
the
door
of
the
royal
kennel
opened
and
an
enormous
newfoundland
dog
put
his
head
out
wow
was
his
first
question
his
majesty
speaks
to
you
the
sentinel
hastily
whispered
to
bruno
should
prick
up
your
ears
bruno
looked
doubtfully
at
sylvie
rather
not
please
he
said
would
illustration
the
hurt
a
bit
the
sentinel
said
with
some
indignation
like
this
and
he
pricked
up
his
ears
like
two
railway
signals
sylvie
gently
explained
matters
afraid
we
manage
it
she
said
in
a
low
voice
very
sorry
but
our
ears
got
the
she
wanted
to
say
in
doggee
but
she
had
forgotten
the
word
and
could
only
think
of
the
sentinel
repeated
explanation
to
the
king
prick
up
their
ears
without
a
his
majesty
exclaimed
be
curious
creatures
i
must
have
a
look
at
them
and
he
came
out
of
his
kennel
and
walked
solemnly
up
to
the
children
what
was
the
to
say
the
the
whole
assembly
when
sylvie
actually
his
majesty
on
the
while
bruno
seized
his
long
ears
and
pretended
to
tie
them
together
under
his
chin
the
sentinel
groaned
aloud
a
beautiful
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
ladies
in
away
and
all
the
other
courtiers
hastily
drew
back
and
left
plenty
of
room
for
the
huge
newfoundland
to
spring
upon
the
audacious
strangers
and
tear
them
limb
from
limb
on
the
contrary
his
majesty
actually
far
as
a
dog
the
other
dogs
believe
their
eyes
but
it
was
true
all
the
same
his
majesty
his
hooh
hahwooh
that
is
i
never
was
the
universal
cry
his
majesty
looked
round
him
severely
and
gave
a
slight
growl
which
produced
instant
silence
to
the
he
said
laying
such
an
emphasis
on
that
several
of
the
dogs
rolled
over
helplessly
on
their
backs
and
began
to
lick
feet
a
procession
was
formed
but
i
only
ventured
to
follow
as
far
as
the
of
the
so
furious
was
the
uproar
of
barking
dogs
within
so
i
sat
down
by
the
king
who
seemed
to
have
gone
to
sleep
and
waited
till
the
children
returned
to
say
when
his
majesty
got
up
and
shook
himself
for
bed
he
said
with
a
sleepy
yawn
attendants
will
show
you
your
room
he
added
aside
to
sylvie
and
bruno
lights
and
with
a
dignified
air
he
held
out
his
paw
for
them
to
kiss
but
the
children
were
evidently
not
well
practised
in
sylvie
simply
stroked
the
great
paw
bruno
hugged
it
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
looked
shocked
all
this
time
in
splendid
livery
were
running
up
with
lighted
candles
but
as
fast
as
they
put
them
upon
the
table
other
waiters
ran
away
with
them
so
that
there
never
seemed
to
be
one
for
though
the
master
kept
nudging
me
with
his
elbow
and
repeating
let
you
sleep
not
in
you
know
i
made
a
great
effort
and
just
succeeded
in
getting
out
the
words
know
not
in
an
forty
winks
will
do
you
no
harm
the
master
said
and
left
me
i
could
scarcely
hear
his
words
and
no
wonder
he
was
leaning
over
the
side
of
a
ship
that
was
miles
away
from
the
pier
on
which
i
stood
the
ship
passed
over
the
horizon
and
i
sank
back
into
the
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
that
it
was
morning
breakfast
was
just
over
sylvie
was
lifting
bruno
down
from
a
high
chair
and
saying
to
a
spaniel
who
was
regarding
them
with
a
most
benevolent
smile
thank
you
had
a
nice
breakfast
we
bruno
was
too
many
bones
in
bruno
began
but
sylvie
frowned
at
him
and
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
for
at
this
moment
the
travelers
were
waited
on
by
a
very
dignified
officer
the
whose
duty
it
was
first
to
conduct
them
to
the
king
to
bid
him
farewell
and
then
to
escort
them
to
the
boundary
of
dogland
the
great
newfoundland
received
them
most
affably
but
instead
of
saying
he
startled
the
into
giving
three
savage
growls
by
announcing
that
he
would
escort
them
himself
is
a
most
unusual
proceeding
your
majesty
the
exclaimed
almost
choking
with
vexation
at
being
set
aside
for
he
had
put
on
his
best
made
entirely
of
for
the
occasion
shall
escort
them
myself
his
majesty
repeated
gently
but
firmly
laying
aside
the
royal
robes
and
changing
his
crown
for
a
small
coronet
you
may
stay
at
glad
bruno
whispered
to
sylvie
when
they
had
got
well
out
of
hearing
were
so
cross
and
he
not
only
patted
their
royal
escort
but
even
hugged
him
round
the
neck
in
the
exuberance
of
his
delight
his
majesty
calmly
wagged
the
royal
tail
quite
a
relief
he
said
away
from
that
palace
now
and
then
royal
dogs
have
a
dull
life
of
it
i
can
tell
you
would
you
this
to
sylvie
in
a
low
voice
and
looking
a
little
shy
and
embarrassed
you
mind
the
trouble
of
just
throwing
that
stick
for
me
to
fetch
sylvie
was
too
much
astonished
to
do
anything
for
a
moment
it
sounded
such
a
monstrous
impossibility
that
a
should
wish
to
run
after
a
stick
but
was
equal
to
the
occasion
and
with
a
glad
shout
of
then
fetch
it
good
doggie
he
hurled
it
over
a
clump
of
bushes
the
next
moment
the
monarch
of
dogland
had
bounded
over
the
bushes
and
picked
up
the
stick
and
came
galloping
back
to
the
children
with
it
in
his
mouth
bruno
took
it
from
him
with
great
decision
for
it
he
insisted
and
his
majesty
begged
commanded
sylvie
and
his
majesty
gave
his
paw
in
short
the
solemn
ceremony
of
escorting
the
travelers
to
the
boundaries
of
dogland
became
one
long
uproarious
game
of
play
business
is
business
the
said
at
last
i
must
go
back
to
mine
i
come
any
further
he
added
consulting
a
which
hung
on
a
chain
round
his
neck
even
if
there
were
a
in
sight
they
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
his
majesty
and
trudged
on
a
dear
dog
bruno
exclaimed
we
to
go
far
sylvie
tired
much
further
darling
sylvie
gently
replied
you
see
that
shining
just
beyond
those
trees
almost
the
gate
of
fairyland
i
know
all
told
me
so
bright
so
bright
she
went
on
dreamily
dazzles
said
bruno
shading
his
eyes
with
one
little
hand
while
the
other
clung
tightly
to
hand
as
if
he
were
at
her
strange
manner
for
the
child
moved
on
as
if
walking
in
her
sleep
her
large
eyes
gazing
into
the
far
distance
and
her
breath
coming
and
going
in
quick
pantings
of
eager
delight
i
knew
by
some
mysterious
mental
light
that
a
great
change
was
taking
place
in
my
sweet
little
friend
for
such
i
loved
to
think
her
and
that
she
was
passing
from
the
condition
of
a
mere
outland
sprite
into
the
true
upon
bruno
the
change
came
later
but
it
was
completed
in
both
before
they
reached
the
golden
gate
through
which
i
knew
it
would
be
impossible
for
to
follow
i
could
but
stand
outside
and
take
a
last
look
at
the
two
sweet
children
ere
they
disappeared
within
and
the
golden
gate
closed
with
a
bang
and
with
a
bang
never
shut
like
any
other
arthur
explained
something
wrong
with
the
hinge
however
the
cake
and
wine
and
had
your
forty
winks
so
you
really
get
off
to
bed
old
man
fit
for
nothing
else
witness
my
hand
arthur
forester
by
this
time
i
was
again
yet
i
pleaded
not
sleepy
now
and
it
midnight
i
did
want
to
say
another
word
to
you
arthur
replied
in
a
relenting
tone
as
he
supplied
me
with
the
supper
he
had
prescribed
i
thought
you
were
too
sleepy
for
it
we
took
our
midnight
meal
almost
in
silence
for
an
unusual
nervousness
seemed
to
have
seized
on
my
old
friend
kind
of
a
night
is
it
he
asked
rising
and
undrawing
the
apparently
to
change
the
subject
for
a
minute
i
followed
him
to
the
window
and
we
stood
together
looking
out
in
silence
i
first
spoke
to
you
arthur
began
after
a
long
and
embarrassing
silence
is
when
we
first
talked
about
i
think
it
was
that
introduced
the
own
position
in
life
forbade
me
to
do
more
than
worship
her
from
a
distance
and
i
was
turning
over
plans
for
leaving
this
place
finally
and
settling
somewhere
out
of
all
chance
of
meeting
her
again
that
seemed
to
be
my
only
chance
of
usefulness
in
that
have
been
wise
i
said
leave
yourself
no
hope
at
all
no
hope
to
leave
arthur
firmly
replied
though
his
eyes
glittered
with
tears
as
he
gazed
upwards
into
the
midnight
sky
from
which
one
solitary
star
the
glorious
blazed
out
in
fitful
splendour
through
the
driving
clouds
was
like
that
star
to
beautiful
and
pure
but
out
of
reach
out
of
reach
he
drew
the
curtains
again
and
we
returned
to
our
places
by
the
fireside
i
wanted
to
tell
you
was
this
he
resumed
heard
this
evening
from
my
solicitor
i
go
into
the
details
of
the
business
but
the
upshot
is
that
my
worldly
wealth
is
much
more
than
i
thought
and
i
am
or
shall
soon
be
in
a
position
to
offer
marriage
without
imprudence
to
any
lady
even
if
she
brought
nothing
i
doubt
if
there
would
be
anything
on
side
the
earl
is
poor
i
believe
but
i
should
have
enough
for
both
even
if
health
wish
you
all
happiness
in
your
married
life
i
cried
you
speak
to
the
earl
yet
awhile
said
arthur
is
very
friendly
but
i
dare
not
think
he
means
more
than
that
as
yet
and
as
for
lady
muriel
try
as
i
may
i
read
her
feelings
towards
me
if
there
love
she
is
hiding
it
no
i
must
wait
i
must
wait
i
did
not
like
to
press
any
further
advice
on
my
friend
whose
judgment
i
felt
was
so
much
more
sober
and
thoughtful
than
my
own
and
we
parted
without
more
words
on
the
subject
that
had
now
absorbed
his
thoughts
nay
his
very
life
the
next
morning
a
letter
from
solicitor
arrived
summoning
me
to
town
on
important
business
chapter
xiv
for
a
full
month
the
business
for
which
i
had
returned
to
london
detained
me
there
and
even
then
it
was
only
the
urgent
advice
of
my
physician
that
induced
me
to
leave
it
unfinished
and
pay
another
visit
to
elveston
arthur
had
written
once
or
twice
during
the
month
but
in
none
of
his
letters
was
there
any
mention
of
lady
muriel
still
i
did
not
augur
ill
from
his
silence
to
me
it
looked
like
the
natural
action
of
a
lover
who
even
while
his
heart
was
singing
is
mine
would
fear
to
paint
his
happiness
in
the
cold
phrases
of
a
written
letter
but
would
wait
to
tell
it
by
word
of
mouth
i
thought
am
to
hear
his
song
of
triumph
from
his
own
lips
the
night
i
arrived
we
had
much
to
say
on
other
matters
and
tired
with
the
journey
i
went
to
bed
early
leaving
the
happy
secret
still
untold
next
day
however
as
we
chatted
on
over
the
remains
of
luncheon
i
ventured
to
put
the
momentous
question
old
friend
you
have
told
me
nothing
of
lady
when
the
happy
day
is
to
be
happy
day
arthur
said
looking
unexpectedly
grave
yet
in
the
dim
future
we
need
to
rather
needs
to
know
better
i
know
sweet
nature
thoroughly
by
this
time
but
i
dare
not
speak
till
i
am
sure
that
my
love
is
wait
too
long
i
said
gaily
heart
never
won
fair
lady
heart
perhaps
but
really
i
not
speak
just
meanwhile
i
pleaded
are
running
a
risk
that
perhaps
you
have
not
thought
of
some
other
said
arthur
firmly
is
i
am
sure
of
that
yet
if
she
loves
another
better
than
me
so
be
it
i
will
not
spoil
her
happiness
the
secret
shall
die
with
me
but
she
is
my
my
love
is
all
very
beautiful
i
said
it
is
not
it
is
not
like
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
or
his
desert
is
small
who
dares
not
put
it
to
the
touch
to
win
or
lose
it
not
ask
the
question
whether
there
is
another
he
said
passionately
would
break
my
heart
to
know
it
is
it
wise
to
leave
it
unasked
you
must
not
waste
your
life
upon
an
tell
you
i
not
find
it
out
for
you
i
asked
with
the
freedom
of
an
old
friend
no
he
replied
with
a
pained
look
entreat
you
to
say
nothing
let
it
you
please
i
said
and
judged
it
best
to
say
no
more
just
then
this
evening
i
thought
will
call
on
the
earl
i
may
be
able
to
how
the
land
lies
without
so
much
as
saying
a
word
it
was
a
very
hot
hot
to
go
for
a
walk
or
do
else
it
have
happened
i
believe
in
the
first
place
i
want
to
child
who
reads
this
fairies
should
always
be
teaching
to
do
our
duty
and
lecturing
when
we
go
wrong
and
we
should
never
teach
anything
you
mean
to
say
that
fairies
are
never
greedy
or
selfish
or
cross
or
deceitful
because
that
would
be
nonsense
you
know
well
then
you
think
they
might
be
all
the
better
for
a
little
lecturing
and
punishing
now
and
then
i
really
see
why
it
be
tried
and
almost
sure
that
if
you
could
only
catch
a
fairy
and
put
it
in
the
corner
and
give
it
nothing
but
bread
and
water
for
a
day
or
two
find
it
quite
an
improved
would
take
down
its
conceit
a
little
at
all
events
the
next
question
is
what
is
the
best
time
for
seeing
fairies
i
believe
i
can
tell
you
all
about
that
the
first
rule
is
that
it
must
be
a
hot
we
may
consider
as
settled
and
you
must
be
just
a
not
too
sleepy
to
keep
your
eyes
open
mind
well
and
you
ought
to
feel
a
one
may
call
scotch
call
it
and
perhaps
a
prettier
word
if
you
know
what
it
means
afraid
i
can
hardly
explain
it
you
must
wait
till
you
meet
a
fairy
and
then
know
and
the
last
rule
is
that
the
crickets
should
not
be
chirping
i
stop
to
explain
that
you
must
take
it
on
trust
for
the
present
so
if
all
these
things
happen
together
you
have
a
good
chance
of
seeing
a
at
least
a
much
better
chance
than
if
they
the
first
thing
i
noticed
as
i
went
lazily
along
through
an
open
place
in
the
wood
was
a
large
beetle
lying
struggling
on
its
back
and
i
went
down
upon
one
knee
to
help
the
poor
thing
to
its
feet
again
in
some
things
you
know
you
be
quite
sure
what
an
insect
would
like
for
instance
i
never
could
quite
settle
supposing
i
were
a
moth
whether
i
would
rather
be
kept
out
of
the
candle
or
be
allowed
to
fly
straight
in
and
get
again
supposing
i
were
a
spider
not
sure
if
i
should
be
pleased
to
have
my
web
torn
down
and
the
fly
let
i
feel
quite
certain
that
if
i
were
a
beetle
and
had
rolled
over
on
my
back
i
should
always
be
glad
to
be
helped
up
again
so
as
i
was
saying
i
had
gone
down
upon
one
knee
and
was
just
reaching
out
a
little
stick
to
turn
the
beetle
over
when
i
saw
a
sight
that
made
me
draw
back
hastily
and
hold
my
breath
for
fear
of
making
any
noise
and
frightening
the
little
creature
away
not
that
she
looked
as
if
she
would
be
easily
frightened
she
seemed
so
good
and
gentle
that
sure
she
would
never
expect
that
any
one
could
wish
to
hurt
her
she
was
only
a
few
inches
high
and
was
dressed
in
green
so
that
you
really
would
hardly
have
noticed
her
among
the
long
grass
and
she
was
so
delicate
and
graceful
that
she
quite
seemed
to
belong
to
the
place
almost
as
if
she
were
one
of
the
flowers
i
may
tell
you
besides
that
she
had
no
wings
i
believe
in
fairies
with
wings
and
that
she
had
quantities
of
long
brown
hair
and
large
earnest
brown
eyes
and
then
i
shall
have
done
all
i
can
to
give
you
an
idea
of
her
illustration
sylvie
i
found
out
her
name
afterwards
had
knelt
down
just
as
i
was
doing
to
help
the
beetle
but
it
needed
more
than
a
little
stick
for
to
get
it
on
its
legs
again
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
with
both
arms
to
roll
the
heavy
thing
over
and
all
the
while
she
was
talking
to
it
half
scolding
and
half
comforting
as
a
nurse
might
do
with
a
child
that
had
fallen
down
there
you
cry
so
much
about
it
not
killed
if
you
were
you
cry
you
know
and
so
a
general
rule
against
crying
my
dear
and
how
did
you
come
to
tumble
over
but
i
can
see
well
enough
how
it
ask
you
over
with
your
chin
in
the
air
as
usual
of
course
if
you
go
among
like
that
you
must
expect
to
tumble
you
should
the
beetle
murmured
something
that
sounded
like
look
and
sylvie
went
on
again
i
know
you
you
never
do
you
always
walk
with
your
chin
so
dreadfully
conceited
well
see
how
many
legs
are
broken
this
time
why
none
of
them
i
declare
and
the
good
of
having
six
legs
my
dear
if
you
can
only
kick
them
all
about
in
the
air
when
you
tumble
legs
are
meant
to
walk
with
you
know
now
begin
putting
out
your
wings
yet
more
to
say
go
to
the
frog
that
lives
behind
that
him
my
you
say
the
beetle
tried
and
i
suppose
succeeded
right
and
tell
him
to
give
you
some
of
that
salve
i
left
with
him
yesterday
and
better
get
him
to
rub
it
in
for
you
got
rather
cold
hands
but
you
mind
i
think
the
beetle
must
have
shuddered
at
this
idea
for
sylvie
went
on
in
a
graver
tone
you
pretend
to
be
so
particular
as
all
that
as
if
you
were
too
grand
to
be
rubbed
by
a
frog
the
fact
is
you
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
him
suppose
you
could
get
nobody
but
a
toad
to
do
it
how
would
you
like
there
was
a
little
pause
and
then
sylvie
added
you
may
go
be
a
good
beetle
and
keep
your
chin
in
the
and
then
began
one
of
those
performances
of
humming
and
whizzing
and
restless
banging
about
such
as
a
beetle
indulges
in
when
it
has
decided
on
flying
but
quite
made
up
its
mind
which
way
to
go
at
last
in
one
of
its
awkward
it
managed
to
fly
right
into
my
face
and
by
the
time
i
had
recovered
from
the
shock
the
little
fairy
was
gone
i
looked
about
in
all
directions
for
the
little
creature
but
there
was
no
trace
of
my
feeling
was
quite
gone
off
and
the
crickets
were
chirping
again
i
knew
she
was
really
gone
and
now
got
time
to
tell
you
the
rule
about
the
crickets
they
always
leave
off
chirping
when
a
fairy
goes
a
a
kind
of
queen
over
them
i
all
events
a
much
grander
thing
than
a
whenever
walking
out
and
the
crickets
suddenly
leave
off
chirping
you
may
be
sure
that
they
see
a
fairy
i
walked
on
sadly
enough
you
may
be
sure
however
i
comforted
myself
with
thinking
been
a
very
wonderful
afternoon
so
far
just
go
quietly
on
and
look
about
me
and
i
wonder
if
i
were
to
come
across
another
fairy
peering
about
in
this
way
i
happened
to
notice
a
plant
with
rounded
leaves
and
with
queer
little
holes
cut
in
the
middle
of
several
of
them
the
leafcutter
bee
i
carelessly
know
i
am
very
learned
in
natural
history
for
instance
i
can
always
tell
kittens
from
chickens
at
one
glance
i
was
passing
on
when
a
sudden
thought
made
me
stoop
down
and
examine
the
leaves
then
a
little
thrill
of
delight
ran
through
i
noticed
that
the
holes
were
all
arranged
so
as
to
form
letters
there
were
three
leaves
side
by
side
with
and
marked
on
them
and
after
some
search
i
found
two
more
which
contained
an
and
an
and
then
all
in
a
moment
a
flash
of
inner
light
seemed
to
illumine
a
part
of
my
life
that
had
all
but
faded
into
strange
visions
i
had
experienced
during
my
journey
to
elveston
and
with
a
thrill
of
delight
i
thought
visions
are
destined
to
be
linked
with
my
waking
life
by
this
time
the
feeling
had
come
back
again
and
i
suddenly
observed
that
no
crickets
were
chirping
so
i
felt
quite
sure
that
was
somewhere
very
near
and
so
indeed
he
near
that
i
had
very
nearly
walked
over
him
without
seeing
him
which
would
have
been
dreadful
always
supposing
that
fairies
be
walked
own
belief
is
that
they
are
something
of
the
nature
of
and
no
walking
over
think
of
any
pretty
little
boy
you
know
with
rosy
cheeks
large
dark
eyes
and
tangled
brown
hair
and
then
fancy
him
made
small
enough
to
go
comfortably
into
a
and
have
a
very
fair
idea
of
him
your
name
little
one
i
began
in
as
soft
a
voice
as
i
could
manage
and
by
the
way
why
is
it
we
always
begin
by
asking
little
children
their
names
is
it
because
we
fancy
a
name
will
help
to
make
them
a
little
bigger
you
never
thought
of
asking
a
real
large
man
his
name
now
did
you
but
however
that
may
be
i
felt
it
quite
necessary
to
know
name
so
as
he
answer
my
question
i
asked
it
again
a
little
louder
your
name
my
little
man
oors
he
said
without
looking
up
i
told
him
my
name
quite
gently
for
he
was
much
too
small
to
be
angry
with
of
anything
he
asked
just
looking
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
going
on
with
his
work
duke
at
all
i
said
a
little
ashamed
of
having
to
confess
it
big
enough
to
be
two
dukes
said
the
little
creature
suppose
sir
something
then
i
said
feeling
more
and
more
ashamed
got
any
the
fairy
seemed
to
think
that
in
that
case
i
really
worth
the
trouble
of
talking
to
for
he
quietly
went
on
digging
and
tearing
the
flowers
to
pieces
after
a
few
minutes
i
tried
again
tell
me
what
your
name
the
little
fellow
answered
very
readily
oo
say
before
something
like
what
we
used
to
be
taught
in
the
nursery
i
thought
to
myself
looking
back
through
the
long
years
about
a
hundred
of
them
since
you
ask
the
question
to
the
time
when
i
was
a
little
child
and
here
an
idea
came
into
my
head
and
i
asked
him
you
one
of
the
fairies
that
teach
children
to
be
good
we
have
to
do
that
sometimes
said
bruno
a
dreadful
bother
it
as
he
said
this
he
savagely
tore
a
heartsease
in
two
and
trampled
on
the
pieces
you
doing
there
bruno
i
said
garden
was
all
the
answer
bruno
would
give
at
first
but
as
he
went
on
tearing
up
the
flowers
he
muttered
to
himself
nasty
cross
let
me
go
and
play
this
morning
i
must
finish
my
lessons
indeed
vex
her
finely
though
bruno
you
do
that
i
cried
you
know
revenge
and
revenge
is
a
wicked
cruel
dangerous
thing
said
bruno
a
funny
word
i
suppose
oo
call
it
cruel
and
dangerous
if
oo
wented
too
far
and
tumbleded
in
get
not
i
explained
saying
the
word
very
slowly
but
i
help
thinking
that
explanation
did
very
well
for
either
word
said
bruno
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
but
without
trying
to
repeat
the
word
try
and
pronounce
it
bruno
i
said
cheerfully
but
bruno
only
tossed
his
little
head
and
said
he
that
his
mouth
the
right
shape
for
words
of
that
kind
and
the
more
i
laughed
the
more
sulky
the
little
fellow
got
about
it
never
mind
my
little
man
i
said
i
help
you
with
that
job
please
bruno
said
quite
pacified
i
wiss
i
could
think
of
somefin
to
vex
her
more
than
this
oo
know
how
hard
it
is
to
make
her
angry
listen
to
me
bruno
and
teach
you
quite
a
splendid
kind
of
revenge
vex
her
finely
he
asked
with
gleaming
eyes
that
will
vex
her
finely
first
get
up
all
the
weeds
in
her
garden
see
there
are
a
good
many
at
this
hiding
the
vex
her
said
bruno
that
i
said
without
noticing
the
remark
water
this
highest
here
you
see
getting
quite
dry
and
bruno
looked
at
me
inquisitively
but
he
said
nothing
this
time
after
that
i
went
on
walks
want
sweeping
a
bit
and
i
think
you
might
cut
down
that
tall
so
close
to
the
garden
that
quite
in
the
oo
talking
about
bruno
impatiently
interrupted
me
that
vex
her
a
bit
it
i
said
innocently
after
that
suppose
we
put
in
some
of
these
coloured
to
mark
the
divisions
between
the
different
kinds
of
flowers
you
know
have
a
very
pretty
bruno
turned
round
and
had
another
good
stare
at
me
at
last
there
came
an
odd
little
twinkle
into
his
eyes
and
he
said
with
quite
a
new
meaning
in
his
voice
do
nicely
put
in
the
red
together
and
all
the
blue
do
capitally
i
said
kind
of
flowers
does
sylvie
like
best
bruno
had
to
put
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
and
consider
a
little
before
he
could
answer
he
said
at
last
a
beautiful
bed
of
violets
down
by
the
fetch
cried
bruno
giving
a
little
skip
into
the
air
catch
hold
of
my
hand
and
help
oo
along
the
grass
is
rather
thick
down
that
i
help
laughing
at
his
having
so
entirely
forgotten
what
a
big
creature
he
was
talking
to
not
yet
bruno
i
said
must
consider
the
right
thing
to
do
first
you
see
got
quite
a
business
before
consider
said
bruno
putting
his
thumb
into
his
mouth
again
and
sitting
down
upon
a
dead
mouse
do
you
keep
that
mouse
for
i
said
should
either
bury
it
or
else
throw
it
into
the
to
measure
with
cried
bruno
ever
would
oo
do
a
garden
without
one
we
make
each
bed
three
mouses
and
a
half
long
and
two
mouses
i
stopped
him
as
he
was
dragging
it
off
by
the
tail
to
show
me
how
it
was
used
for
i
was
half
afraid
the
feeling
might
go
off
before
we
had
finished
the
garden
and
in
that
case
i
should
see
no
more
of
him
or
sylvie
think
the
best
way
will
be
for
to
weed
the
beds
while
sort
out
these
pebbles
ready
to
mark
the
walks
it
cried
bruno
tell
oo
about
the
caterpillars
while
we
hear
about
the
caterpillars
i
said
as
i
drew
the
pebbles
together
into
a
heap
and
began
dividing
them
into
colours
and
bruno
went
on
in
a
low
rapid
tone
more
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
i
saw
two
little
caterpillars
when
i
was
sitting
by
the
brook
just
where
oo
go
into
the
wood
they
were
quite
green
and
they
had
yellow
eyes
and
they
see
and
one
of
them
had
got
a
wing
to
great
brown
wing
oo
know
all
dry
with
feathers
so
he
want
it
to
eat
i
should
he
meant
to
make
a
cloak
for
the
winter
i
said
for
bruno
had
twisted
up
the
last
word
into
a
sort
of
question
and
was
looking
at
me
for
an
answer
one
word
was
quite
enough
for
the
little
fellow
and
he
went
on
merrily
and
so
he
want
the
other
caterpillar
to
see
the
wing
oo
what
must
he
do
but
try
to
carry
it
with
all
his
left
legs
and
he
tried
to
walk
on
the
other
set
of
course
he
toppled
over
after
what
i
said
catching
at
the
last
word
for
to
tell
the
truth
i
been
attending
much
toppled
over
bruno
repeated
very
gravely
if
ever
saw
a
caterpillar
topple
over
know
a
welly
serious
thing
and
not
sit
grinning
like
i
tell
oo
no
more
and
indeed
bruno
i
mean
to
grin
see
quite
grave
again
but
bruno
only
folded
his
arms
and
said
tell
i
see
a
little
twinkle
in
one
of
oor
like
the
do
you
think
like
the
moon
bruno
i
asked
face
is
large
and
round
like
the
moon
bruno
answered
looking
at
me
thoughtfully
shine
quite
so
more
i
help
smiling
at
this
know
i
sometimes
wash
face
bruno
the
moon
never
does
she
though
cried
bruno
and
he
leant
forwards
and
added
in
a
solemn
whisper
face
gets
dirtier
and
dirtier
every
night
till
black
all
across
and
then
when
dirty
all
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
own
rosy
cheeks
as
he
spoke
she
washes
all
clean
again
it
all
in
a
moment
said
bruno
a
deal
of
teaching
oo
wants
she
washes
it
little
by
she
begins
at
the
other
edge
oo
by
this
time
he
was
sitting
quietly
on
the
dead
mouse
with
his
arms
folded
and
the
weeding
getting
on
a
bit
so
i
had
to
say
first
pleasure
afterwards
no
more
talking
till
that
chapter
xv
revenge
after
that
we
had
a
few
minutes
of
silence
while
i
sorted
out
the
pebbles
and
amused
myself
with
watching
plan
of
gardening
it
was
quite
a
new
plan
to
me
he
always
measured
each
bed
before
he
weeded
it
as
if
he
was
afraid
the
weeding
would
make
it
shrink
and
once
when
it
came
out
longer
than
he
wished
he
set
to
work
to
thump
the
mouse
with
his
little
fist
crying
out
now
all
gone
wrong
again
why
oo
keep
oor
tail
straight
when
i
tell
oo
tell
you
what
do
bruno
said
in
a
as
we
worked
like
fairies
oo
i
said
course
i
do
or
i
have
come
here
i
should
have
gone
to
some
place
where
there
are
no
bruno
laughed
contemptuously
oo
might
as
well
say
go
to
some
place
where
there
any
oo
like
air
this
was
a
rather
difficult
idea
to
grasp
i
tried
a
change
of
subject
nearly
the
first
fairy
i
ever
saw
have
ever
seen
any
people
besides
me
said
bruno
see
when
we
walk
in
the
they
see
how
is
it
they
never
tread
on
you
on
us
said
bruno
looking
amused
at
my
ignorance
suppose
walking
making
little
marks
on
the
ground
suppose
a
very
well
then
oo
put
one
foot
here
and
one
foot
here
so
oo
tread
on
the
this
was
all
very
well
as
an
explanation
but
it
convince
me
i
put
one
foot
the
fairy
i
asked
know
the
little
fellow
said
in
a
thoughtful
tone
i
know
oo
nobody
never
walked
on
the
top
of
a
fairy
now
tell
oo
what
do
as
so
fond
of
fairies
get
oo
an
invitation
to
the
i
know
one
of
the
i
help
laughing
at
this
idea
the
waiters
invite
the
guests
i
asked
not
sit
bruno
said
to
wait
at
table
like
that
oo
to
hand
about
plates
and
so
but
not
so
nice
as
sitting
at
the
table
is
it
course
it
bruno
said
in
a
tone
as
if
he
rather
pitied
my
ignorance
if
not
even
sir
anything
oo
expect
to
be
allowed
to
sit
at
the
table
oo
i
said
as
meekly
as
i
could
that
i
expect
it
but
it
was
the
only
way
of
going
to
a
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
bruno
tossed
his
head
and
said
in
a
rather
offended
tone
that
i
might
do
as
i
were
many
he
knew
that
would
give
their
ears
to
go
you
ever
been
yourself
bruno
invited
me
once
last
week
bruno
said
very
gravely
was
to
wash
up
the
the
i
was
grand
enough
and
i
waited
at
table
and
i
hardly
make
only
was
it
i
said
mind
telling
bringing
scissors
to
cut
the
beef
with
bruno
said
carelessly
the
grandest
thing
of
all
was
fetched
the
king
a
glass
of
cider
grand
i
said
biting
my
lip
to
keep
myself
from
laughing
it
said
bruno
very
earnestly
know
it
every
one
had
such
an
honour
as
this
set
me
thinking
of
the
various
queer
things
we
call
in
this
world
but
which
after
all
a
bit
more
honour
in
them
than
what
bruno
enjoyed
when
he
took
the
king
a
glass
of
cider
i
know
how
long
i
might
not
have
dreamed
on
in
this
way
if
bruno
suddenly
roused
me
come
here
quick
he
cried
in
a
state
of
the
wildest
excitement
hold
of
his
other
horn
i
hold
him
more
than
a
minute
he
was
struggling
desperately
with
a
great
snail
clinging
to
one
of
its
horns
and
nearly
breaking
his
poor
little
back
in
his
efforts
to
drag
it
over
a
blade
of
grass
i
saw
we
should
have
no
more
gardening
if
i
let
this
sort
of
thing
go
on
so
i
quietly
took
the
snail
away
and
put
it
on
a
bank
where
he
reach
it
hunt
it
afterwards
bruno
i
said
you
really
want
to
catch
it
but
the
use
of
it
when
got
it
the
use
of
a
fox
when
got
it
said
bruno
know
oo
big
things
hunt
i
tried
to
think
of
some
good
reason
why
should
hunt
foxes
and
he
should
not
hunt
snails
but
none
came
into
my
head
so
i
said
at
last
i
suppose
as
good
as
the
other
go
myself
some
should
think
oo
be
so
silly
said
bruno
to
go
by
oorself
why
never
get
the
snail
along
if
oo
somebody
to
hold
on
to
his
other
horn
course
i
go
i
said
quite
gravely
the
way
is
that
the
best
kind
to
hunt
or
do
you
recommend
the
ones
without
shells
no
we
never
hunt
the
ones
without
shells
bruno
said
with
a
little
shudder
at
the
thought
of
it
always
so
cross
about
it
and
then
if
oo
tumbles
over
them
ever
so
sticky
by
this
time
we
had
nearly
finished
the
garden
i
had
fetched
some
violets
and
bruno
was
just
helping
me
to
put
in
the
last
when
he
suddenly
stopped
and
said
then
i
said
can
go
on
without
you
quite
bruno
needed
no
second
invitation
he
at
once
began
arranging
the
dead
mouse
as
a
kind
of
sofa
sing
oo
a
little
song
he
said
as
he
rolled
it
about
said
i
like
songs
very
song
will
oo
choose
bruno
said
as
he
dragged
the
mouse
into
a
place
where
he
could
get
a
good
view
of
me
ting
is
the
there
was
no
resisting
such
a
strong
hint
as
this
however
i
pretended
to
think
about
it
for
a
moment
and
then
said
i
like
ting
ting
best
of
illustration
revenge
shows
a
good
judge
of
music
bruno
said
with
a
pleased
look
many
would
oo
like
and
he
put
his
thumb
into
his
mouth
to
help
me
to
consider
as
there
was
only
one
cluster
of
within
easy
reach
i
said
very
gravely
that
i
thought
one
would
do
time
and
i
picked
it
and
gave
it
to
him
bruno
ran
his
hand
once
or
twice
up
and
down
the
flowers
like
a
musician
trying
an
instrument
producing
a
most
delicious
delicate
tinkling
as
he
did
so
i
had
never
heard
think
one
can
unless
in
the
i
know
quite
how
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
it
was
like
except
by
saying
that
it
sounded
like
a
peal
of
bells
a
thousand
miles
off
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
flowers
were
in
tune
he
seated
himself
on
the
dead
mouse
he
never
seemed
really
comfortable
anywhere
else
and
looking
up
at
me
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eyes
he
began
by
the
way
the
tune
was
rather
a
curious
one
and
you
might
like
to
try
it
for
yourself
so
here
are
the
notes
illustration
ting
oh
rise
the
daylight
dies
the
owls
are
hooting
ting
ting
ting
wake
oh
wake
beside
the
lake
the
elves
are
fluting
ting
ting
ting
welcoming
our
fairy
king
we
sing
sing
he
sang
the
first
four
lines
briskly
and
merrily
making
the
chime
in
time
with
the
music
but
the
last
two
he
sang
quite
slowly
and
gently
and
merely
waved
the
flowers
backwards
and
forwards
then
he
left
off
to
explain
is
oberon
and
he
lives
across
the
sometimes
he
comes
in
a
little
we
go
and
meet
then
we
sing
this
song
you
then
you
go
and
dine
with
him
i
said
mischievously
talk
bruno
hastily
said
interrupts
the
song
i
said
i
do
it
again
never
talk
myself
when
singing
he
went
on
very
gravely
then
he
tuned
the
once
more
and
sang
oh
hear
from
far
and
near
the
music
stealing
ting
ting
ting
fairy
bells
adown
the
dells
are
merrily
pealing

welcoming
our
fairy
king
we
ring

oh

the
dainties
waiting
ting

is
bruno
i
interrupted
in
a
warning
whisper
coming
bruno
checked
his
song
and
as
she
slowly
made
her
way
through
the
long
grass
he
suddenly
rushed
out
headlong
at
her
like
a
little
bull
shouting
the
other
way
look
the
other
way
way
sylvie
asked
in
rather
a
frightened
tone
as
she
looked
round
in
all
directions
to
see
where
the
danger
could
be
way
said
bruno
carefully
turning
her
round
with
her
face
to
the
wood
walk
be
frightened
oo
trip
but
sylvie
trip
notwithstanding
in
fact
he
led
her
in
his
hurry
across
so
many
little
sticks
and
stones
that
it
was
really
a
wonder
the
poor
child
could
keep
on
her
feet
at
all
but
he
was
far
too
much
excited
to
think
of
what
he
was
doing
i
silently
pointed
out
to
bruno
the
best
place
to
lead
her
to
so
as
to
get
a
view
of
the
whole
garden
at
once
it
was
a
little
rising
ground
about
the
height
of
a
potato
and
when
they
had
mounted
it
i
drew
back
into
the
shade
that
sylvie
see
me
i
heard
bruno
cry
out
triumphantly
oo
may
look
and
then
followed
a
clapping
of
hands
but
it
was
all
done
by
bruno
himself
sylvie
was
only
stood
and
gazed
with
her
hands
clasped
together
and
i
was
half
afraid
she
like
it
after
all
bruno
too
was
watching
her
anxiously
and
when
she
jumped
down
off
the
mound
and
began
wandering
up
and
down
the
little
walks
he
cautiously
followed
her
about
evidently
anxious
that
she
should
form
her
own
opinion
of
it
all
without
any
hint
from
him
and
when
at
last
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
gave
her
a
hurried
whisper
and
without
the
slightest
regard
to
the
loveliest
thing
as
i
never
saw
in
all
my
life
before
the
little
fellow
looked
as
well
pleased
as
if
it
had
been
given
by
all
the
judges
and
juries
in
england
put
together
did
you
really
do
it
all
by
yourself
bruno
said
sylvie
all
for
me
was
helped
a
bit
bruno
began
with
a
merry
little
laugh
at
her
surprise
been
at
it
all
the
thought
and
here
the
poor
little
lip
began
to
quiver
and
all
in
a
moment
he
burst
out
crying
and
running
up
to
sylvie
he
flung
his
arms
passionately
round
her
neck
and
hid
his
face
on
her
shoulder
there
was
a
little
quiver
in
voice
too
as
she
whispered
the
matter
darling
and
tried
to
lift
up
his
head
and
kiss
him
but
bruno
only
clung
to
her
sobbing
and
be
comforted
till
he
had
confessed
spoil
oor
and
then
came
another
burst
of
tears
which
drowned
the
rest
of
the
sentence
at
last
he
got
out
the
words
in
the
i
never
was
so
happy
and
the
rosy
little
face
came
up
at
last
to
be
kissed
all
wet
with
tears
as
it
was
sylvie
was
crying
too
by
this
time
and
she
said
nothing
but
dear
and
never
was
so
happy
before
though
why
these
two
children
who
had
never
been
so
happy
before
should
both
be
crying
was
a
mystery
to
felt
very
happy
too
but
of
course
i
cry
never
do
you
leave
all
that
to
the
fairies
only
i
think
it
must
have
been
raining
a
little
just
then
for
i
found
a
drop
or
two
on
my
cheeks
after
that
they
went
through
the
whole
garden
again
flower
by
flower
as
if
it
were
a
long
sentence
they
were
spelling
out
with
kisses
for
commas
and
a
great
hug
by
way
of
a
when
they
got
to
the
end
oo
know
that
was
my
sylvie
bruno
solemnly
began
sylvie
laughed
merrily
you
mean
she
said
and
she
pushed
back
her
heavy
brown
hair
with
both
hands
and
looked
at
him
with
dancing
eyes
in
which
the
big
were
still
glittering
bruno
drew
in
a
long
breath
and
made
up
his
mouth
for
a
great
effort
mean
he
said
oo
and
he
looked
so
happy
and
proud
at
having
said
the
word
right
at
last
that
i
quite
envied
him
i
rather
think
sylvie
at
all
but
she
gave
him
a
little
kiss
on
each
cheek
which
seemed
to
do
just
as
well
so
they
wandered
off
lovingly
together
in
among
the
buttercups
each
with
an
arm
twined
round
the
other
whispering
and
laughing
as
they
went
and
never
so
much
as
once
looked
back
at
poor
me
yes
once
just
before
i
quite
lost
sight
of
them
bruno
half
turned
his
head
and
nodded
me
a
saucy
little
over
one
shoulder
and
that
was
all
the
thanks
i
got
for
trouble
the
very
last
thing
i
saw
of
them
was
was
stooping
down
with
her
arms
round
neck
and
saying
coaxingly
in
his
ear
you
know
bruno
quite
forgotten
that
hard
word
do
say
it
once
more
come
only
this
once
dear
but
bruno
try
it
again
chapter
xvi
a
changed
crocodile
the
quite
passed
out
of
my
life
for
the
moment
and
the
reigned
supreme
i
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
house
as
it
was
now
witching
of
five
and
i
knew
i
should
find
them
ready
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
quiet
chat
lady
muriel
and
her
father
gave
me
a
delightfully
warm
welcome
they
were
not
of
the
folk
we
meet
in
fashionable
conceal
all
such
feelings
as
they
may
chance
to
possess
beneath
the
impenetrable
mask
of
a
conventional
placidity
man
with
the
iron
was
no
doubt
a
rarity
and
a
marvel
in
his
own
age
in
modern
london
no
one
would
turn
his
head
to
give
him
a
second
look
no
these
were
people
when
they
pleased
it
meant
that
they
pleased
and
when
lady
muriel
said
with
a
bright
smile
glad
to
see
you
again
i
knew
that
it
was
still
i
did
not
venture
to
disobey
the
as
i
felt
them
to
the
young
doctor
by
so
much
as
alluding
to
his
existence
and
it
was
only
after
they
had
given
me
full
details
of
a
projected
picnic
to
which
they
invited
me
that
lady
muriel
exclaimed
almost
as
an
if
you
can
bring
doctor
forester
with
you
sure
a
day
in
the
country
would
do
him
good
afraid
he
studies
too
it
was
the
tip
of
my
to
quote
the
words
only
books
are
looks
but
i
checked
myself
just
in
something
of
the
feeling
of
one
who
has
crossed
a
street
and
has
been
all
but
run
over
by
a
passing
i
think
he
has
too
lonely
a
life
she
went
on
with
a
gentle
earnestness
that
left
no
room
whatever
to
suspect
a
double
meaning
get
him
to
come
and
forget
the
day
tuesday
week
we
can
drive
you
over
it
would
be
a
pity
to
go
by
is
so
much
pretty
scenery
on
the
road
and
our
open
carriage
just
holds
persuade
him
to
come
i
said
with
would
take
all
powers
of
persuasion
to
keep
him
away
the
picnic
was
to
take
place
in
ten
days
and
though
arthur
readily
accepted
the
invitation
i
brought
him
nothing
that
i
could
say
would
induce
him
to
with
me
or
without
the
earl
and
his
daughter
in
the
meanwhile
no
he
feared
to
out
his
welcome
he
said
they
had
enough
of
him
for
one
and
when
at
last
the
day
for
the
expedition
arrived
he
was
so
childishly
nervous
and
uneasy
that
i
thought
it
best
so
to
arrange
our
plans
that
we
should
go
separately
to
the
intention
being
to
arrive
some
time
after
him
so
as
to
give
him
time
to
get
over
a
meeting
with
this
object
i
purposely
made
a
considerable
circuit
on
my
way
to
the
hall
as
we
called
the
house
if
i
could
only
manage
to
lose
my
way
a
bit
i
thought
to
myself
would
suit
me
capitally
in
this
i
succeeded
better
and
sooner
than
i
had
ventured
to
hope
for
the
path
through
the
wood
had
been
made
familiar
to
me
by
many
a
solitary
stroll
in
my
former
visit
to
elveston
and
how
i
could
have
so
suddenly
and
so
entirely
lost
though
i
so
engrossed
in
thinking
of
arthur
and
his
that
i
heeded
little
a
mystery
to
me
this
open
place
i
said
to
myself
to
have
some
memory
about
it
i
can
not
distinctly
it
is
the
very
spot
where
i
saw
those
but
i
hope
there
are
no
snakes
about
i
mused
aloud
taking
my
seat
on
a
fallen
tree
certainly
do
like
i
suppose
likes
them
either
he
like
them
said
a
demure
little
voice
at
my
side
not
of
them
you
know
but
he
them
he
says
too
waggly
words
fail
me
to
describe
the
beauty
of
the
little
on
a
patch
of
moss
on
the
trunk
of
the
fallen
tree
that
met
my
eager
gaze
sylvie
reclining
with
her
elbow
buried
in
the
moss
and
her
rosy
cheek
resting
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
bruno
stretched
at
her
feet
with
his
head
in
her
lap
illustration
fairies
resting
waggly
was
all
i
could
say
in
so
sudden
an
emergency
not
praticular
bruno
said
carelessly
i
like
straight
animals
you
like
a
dog
when
it
wags
its
tail
sylvie
interrupted
you
do
bruno
more
of
a
dog
there
mister
sir
bruno
appealed
to
me
like
to
have
a
dog
if
it
got
nuffin
but
a
head
and
a
tail
i
admitted
that
a
dog
of
that
kind
would
be
uninteresting
such
a
dog
as
that
sylvie
thoughtfully
remarked
there
be
cried
bruno
the
professor
shortened
it
up
for
us
it
up
i
said
something
new
how
does
he
do
it
got
a
curious
sylvie
was
beginning
to
explain
curious
machine
bruno
broke
in
not
at
all
willing
to
have
the
story
thus
taken
out
of
his
mouth
if
oo
puts
end
oo
he
turns
the
it
comes
out
at
the
uvver
end
oh
ever
so
short
short
as
short
sylvie
echoed
one
we
was
in
outland
oo
we
came
to
and
sylvie
took
him
a
big
crocodile
and
he
shortened
it
up
for
us
and
it
look
so
funny
and
it
kept
looking
round
and
saying
the
rest
of
me
got
to
and
then
its
eyes
looked
its
eyes
sylvie
interrupted
not
said
the
little
fellow
the
eye
that
see
wherever
the
rest
of
it
had
got
to
but
the
eye
that
see
short
the
crocodile
i
asked
as
the
story
was
getting
a
little
complicated
as
short
again
as
when
we
caught
long
said
bruno
spreading
out
his
arms
to
their
full
stretch
i
tried
to
calculate
what
this
would
come
to
but
it
was
too
hard
for
me
please
make
it
out
for
me
dear
child
who
reads
this
you
leave
the
poor
thing
so
short
as
that
did
you
no
sylvie
and
me
took
it
back
again
and
we
got
it
stretched
much
was
it
sylvie
times
and
a
half
and
a
little
bit
more
said
sylvie
like
that
better
than
the
other
way
afraid
but
it
did
though
bruno
put
in
eagerly
proud
of
its
new
tail
oo
never
saw
a
crocodile
so
proud
why
it
could
go
round
and
walk
on
the
top
of
its
tail
and
along
its
back
all
the
way
to
its
head
illustration
a
changed
crocodile
all
the
way
said
sylvie
you
but
it
once
bruno
cried
triumphantly
watched
it
and
it
walked
on
so
as
it
wake
itself
it
thought
it
were
asleep
and
it
got
both
its
paws
on
its
tail
and
it
walked
and
it
walked
all
the
way
along
its
back
and
it
walked
and
it
walked
on
its
forehead
and
it
walked
a
tiny
little
way
down
its
nose
there
now
this
was
a
good
deal
worse
than
the
last
puzzle
please
dear
child
help
again
believe
no
crocodile
never
walked
along
its
own
forehead
sylvie
cried
too
much
excited
by
the
controversy
to
limit
the
number
of
her
negatives
know
the
why
it
did
it
bruno
scornfully
retorted
had
a
welly
good
reason
i
it
say
i
walk
on
my
own
forehead
so
a
course
it
oo
know
a
good
reason
bruno
i
said
get
up
that
tree
in
a
minute
said
bruno
as
done
talking
only
two
peoples
talk
comfably
togevver
when
getting
up
a
tree
and
the
other
it
appeared
to
me
that
a
conversation
would
scarcely
be
while
trees
were
being
climbed
even
if
the
were
doing
it
but
it
was
evidently
dangerous
to
oppose
any
theory
of
so
i
thought
it
best
to
let
the
question
drop
and
to
ask
for
an
account
of
the
machine
that
made
things
this
time
bruno
was
at
a
loss
and
left
it
to
sylvie
like
a
mangle
she
said
things
are
put
in
they
get
bruno
interrupted
sylvie
accepted
the
correction
but
did
not
attempt
to
pronounce
the
word
which
was
evidently
new
to
her
they
come
out
oh
ever
so
long
bruno
began
again
and
me
sylvie
whispered
we
a
and
the
professor
mangled
it
longer
for
us
it
were
was
a
little
man
and
he
had
a
little
gun
and
the
know
the
rest
i
interrupted
would
you
say
it
mean
the
way
that
it
came
of
the
mangle
get
the
professor
to
it
for
you
said
sylvie
would
spoil
it
to
would
like
to
meet
the
professor
i
said
i
would
like
to
take
you
all
with
me
to
see
some
friends
of
mine
that
live
near
here
would
you
like
to
come
think
the
would
like
to
come
said
sylvie
shy
but
like
it
very
much
only
better
not
come
size
you
the
difficulty
had
occurred
to
me
already
and
i
had
felt
that
perhaps
there
be
a
slight
awkwardness
in
introducing
two
such
tiny
friends
into
society
size
will
you
be
i
enquired
better
come
sylvie
thoughtfully
replied
the
easiest
size
to
you
come
i
said
thinking
we
could
have
you
at
the
picnic
sylvie
considered
a
little
she
replied
got
the
things
ready
come
next
if
you
like
and
now
bruno
you
must
come
and
do
your
oo
say
bruno
the
little
fellow
pleaded
with
pouting
lips
that
made
him
look
prettier
than
ever
shows
something
horrid
coming
and
i
kiss
you
if
so
but
you
kissed
me
sylvie
exclaimed
in
merry
triumph
then
you
and
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
neck
for
this
novel
but
apparently
not
painful
operation
like
sylvie
remarked
as
soon
as
her
lips
were
again
free
for
speech
know
about
it
it
were
just
the
bruno
replied
with
much
severity
as
he
marched
away
sylvie
turned
her
laughing
face
to
me
we
come
on
tuesday
she
said
well
i
said
it
be
tuesday
next
but
where
the
professor
did
he
come
with
you
to
fairyland
said
sylvie
he
promised
come
and
see
us
day
getting
his
lecture
ready
so
he
has
to
stay
at
home
i
said
dreamily
not
feeling
quite
sure
what
she
had
said
sir
his
lordship
and
lady
muriel
at
home
please
to
walk
this
chapter
xvii
the
three
badgers
still
more
dreamily
i
found
myself
following
this
imperious
voice
into
a
room
where
the
earl
his
daughter
and
arthur
were
seated
come
said
lady
muriel
in
a
tone
of
playful
reproach
was
delayed
i
stammered
though
it
was
that
had
delayed
me
i
should
have
been
puzzled
to
explain
luckily
no
questions
were
asked
the
carriage
was
ordered
round
the
hamper
containing
our
contribution
to
the
picnic
was
duly
stowed
away
and
we
set
forth
there
was
no
need
for
to
maintain
the
conversation
lady
muriel
and
arthur
were
evidently
on
those
most
delightful
of
terms
where
one
has
no
need
to
check
thought
after
thought
as
it
rises
to
the
lips
with
the
fear
will
not
be
will
give
will
sound
too
will
sound
like
very
old
friends
in
fullest
sympathy
their
talk
rippled
on
we
desert
the
picnic
and
go
in
some
other
direction
she
suddenly
suggested
party
of
four
is
surely
and
as
for
our
we
what
a
genuine
argument
laughed
arthur
lady
never
knows
on
which
side
the
burden
of
always
know
she
asked
with
a
pretty
assumption
of
meek
docility
only
one
i
can
think
watts
who
has
asked
the
senseless
question
should
i
deprive
my
neighbour
of
his
goods
against
his
will
fancy
as
an
argument
for
honesty
his
position
seems
to
be
only
honest
because
i
see
no
reason
to
and
the
answer
is
of
course
complete
and
crushing
deprive
my
neighbour
of
his
goods
because
i
want
them
myself
and
i
do
it
against
his
will
because
no
chance
of
getting
him
to
consent
to
it
can
give
you
one
other
exception
i
said
argument
i
heard
only
by
a
lady
i
walk
on
my
own
forehead
a
curious
subject
for
speculation
said
lady
muriel
turning
to
me
with
eyes
brimming
over
with
laughter
we
know
who
propounded
the
question
and
he
walk
on
his
own
forehead
remember
it
was
that
said
it
i
faltered
i
heard
it
it
was
i
hope
we
shall
meet
him
at
the
picnic
said
lady
muriel
a
more
interesting
question
than
this
a
picturesque
ruin
those
lovely
i
shall
have
to
answer
those
two
questions
times
at
least
this
afternoon
one
of
the
miseries
of
society
said
arthur
people
let
one
enjoy
the
beauties
of
nature
without
having
to
so
every
minute
why
should
life
be
one
long
catechism
just
as
bad
at
a
the
earl
remarked
went
to
the
last
may
with
a
conceited
young
artist
and
he
torment
me
i
have
minded
his
criticizing
the
pictures
but
had
to
agree
with
else
to
argue
the
point
which
would
have
been
worse
was
criticism
of
course
said
arthur
see
the
at
did
you
ever
know
a
conceited
man
dare
to
a
picture
the
one
thing
he
dreads
next
to
not
being
noticed
is
be
proved
if
you
once
a
picture
your
character

assembled
we
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
sauntering
about
the
ruins
gathering
at
last
by
common
consent
into
a
few
random
groups
seated
on
the
side
of
a
mound
which
commanded
a
good
view
of
the
old
castle
and
its
surroundings
the
momentary
silence
that
ensued
was
promptly
taken
possession
more
correctly
taken
into
a
voice
a
voice
so
smooth
so
monotonous
so
sonorous
that
one
felt
with
a
shudder
that
any
other
conversation
was
precluded
and
that
unless
some
desperate
remedy
were
adopted
we
were
fated
to
listen
to
a
lecture
of
which
no
man
could
foresee
the
end
the
speaker
was
a
man
whose
large
flat
pale
face
was
bounded
on
the
north
by
a
fringe
of
hair
on
the
east
and
west
by
a
fringe
of
whisker
and
on
the
south
by
a
fringe
of
whole
constituting
a
uniform
halo
of
stubbly
bristles
his
features
were
so
entirely
destitute
of
expression
that
i
could
not
help
saying
to
as
if
in
the
clutches
of
a
are
only
penciled
in
no
final
touches
as
yet
and
he
had
a
way
of
ending
every
sentence
with
a
sudden
smile
which
spread
like
a
ripple
over
that
vast
blank
surface
and
was
gone
in
a
moment
leaving
behind
it
such
absolute
solemnity
that
i
felt
impelled
to
murmur
was
not
it
was
somebody
else
that
smiled
you
observe
such
was
the
phrase
with
which
the
wretch
began
each
sentence
you
observe
the
way
in
which
that
broken
arch
at
the
very
top
of
the
ruin
stands
out
against
the
clear
sky
it
is
placed
right
and
there
is
enough
of
it
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
and
all
would
be
utterly
spoiled

arthur
inaudibly
to
all
but
lady
muriel
and
myself
the
exact
effect
his
work
would
have
when
in
ruins
centuries
after
his
death
do
you
observe
where
those
trees
slope
down
the
hill
indicating
them
with
a
sweep
of
the
hand
and
with
all
the
patronising
air
of
the

who
has
himself
arranged

from

up

intervals

for
artistic
effect
here
in
the
foreground
a
few
clear
touches
are
not
amiss
but
a

know
it
is
simply
barbarous
yes
we
indistinctness
the
orator
looked
so
pointedly
at
as
he
uttered
these
words
that
i
felt
bound
to
reply
by
murmuring
something
to
the
effect
that
i
hardly
felt
the
need
that
i
enjoyed
looking
at
a
thing
better
when
i
could
it
so
the
great
man
sharply
took
me
up
point
of
view
that
is
correctly
put
but
for
any
one
who
has
a
soul
for
such
a
view
is
preposterous

arthur
interposed
with
a
delightful
promptitude
so
the
orator
replied
with
an
air
of
relief
thank
you

and
for
a
few
peaceful
moments
the
orator
brooded
frowningly
over
the
quotation
the
welcome
opportunity
was
seized
and
voice
struck
into
the
silence
a
old
ruin
it
is
cried
a
young
lady
in
spectacles
the
very
embodiment
of
the
march
of
mind
looking
at
lady
muriel
as
the
proper
recipient
of
all
really
remarks
you
admire
those
on
the
trees
do
lady
muriel
shot
a
meaning
glance
at
me
but
replied
with
admirable
gravity
yes
indeed
indeed
true
it
strange
said
the
young
lady
passing
with
startling
suddenness
from
sentiment
to
science
the
mere
impact
of
certain
coloured
rays
upon
the
retina
should
give
us
such
exquisite
pleasure
have
studied
physiology
then
a
certain
young
doctor
courteously
enquired
it
a
science
arthur
slightly
smiled
seems
a
paradox
does
it
not
he
went
on
the
image
formed
on
the
retina
should
be
inverted
puzzling
she
candidly
admitted
is
it
we
do
not
things
have
never
heard
the
theory
then
that
the
also
is
inverted
what
a
fact
but
how
is
it
replied
arthur
with
all
the
gravity
of
ten
professors
rolled
into
one
we
call
the
of
the
brain
is
really
its
and
what
we
call
its
is
really
its
it
is
simply
a
question
of
this
last
polysyllable
settled
the
matter
truly
delightful
the
fair
scientist
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
shall
ask
our
physiological
lecturer
why
he
never
gave
us
that
theory

something
to
be
present

the

asked

whispered
to
me
as
at
a
signal
from
lady

moved
on
to
where
the

had
been
collected

devoted
ourselves

business

on
ourselves

the
modern

two
good
things
in

a
way
as

discomforts
of
both

neither

the
gentlemen
did
not
even
take
their
places
until
the
ladies
had
been
duly
provided
with
all
imaginable
then
i
supplied
myself
with
a
plate
of
something
solid
and
a
glass
of
something
fluid
and
found
a
place
next
to
lady
muriel
it
had
been
left
for
arthur
as
a
distinguished
stranger
but
he
had
turned
shy
and
had
placed
himself
next
to
the
young
lady
in
spectacles
whose
high
rasping
voice
had
already
cast
loose
upon
society
such
ominous
phrases
as
is
a
bundle
of
qualities
objective
is
only
attainable
through
the
subjective
arthur
was
bearing
it
bravely
but
several
faces
wore
a
look
of
alarm
and
i
thought
it
high
time
to
start
some
less
metaphysical
topic
my
nursery
days
i
began
the
weather
suit
for
an
picnic
we
were
allowed
to
have
a
peculiar
kind
that
we
enjoyed
hugely
the
table
cloth
was
laid
the
table
instead
of
upon
it
we
sat
round
it
on
the
floor
and
i
believe
we
really
enjoyed
that
extremely
uncomfortable
kind
of
dinner
more
than
we
ever
did
the
orthodox
arrangement
no
doubt
of
it
lady
muriel
replied
nothing
a
child
hates
so
much
as
regularity
i
believe
a
really
healthy
boy
would
thoroughly
enjoy
greek
only
he
might
stand
on
his
head
to
learn
it
and
your
certainly
spared
you
feature
of
a
picnic
which
is
to
me
its
chief
chance
of
a
shower
i
suggested
the

the
things
occurring
in
combination
with

my
father

with
that

caught
the
word

to

seemed

him

muriel
said
with
that
delicate

laugh
that
was

the

there
was
something
so

this
echo
of
the
very
words
i
had
so
lately
heard
from
that
little
that
it
was
only
by
a
great

i
succeeded
in
saying

muriel
was
the

for
the
moment
that
was
the
only
fact
i
could
clearly
realise
but
how
she
came
to
be
how
came
to
be
how
the
glass
of
champagne
came
to

these
were
questions
which
i
felt
it
better
to
think
out
in
silence
and
not
commit
myself
to
any
statement
till
i
understood
things
a
little
more
clearly
accumulate
a
mass
of
facts
and
construct
a
i
believe
is
the
true
scientific
method
i
sat
up
rubbed
my
eyes
and
began
to
accumulate
facts
a
smooth
grassy
slope
bounded
at
the
upper
end
by
venerable
ruins
half
buried
in

at
the
lower
by

seen
through
arching
dozen
people
seated
in
little
groups
here
and
open
of
a
were
the
accumulated
by
the
scientific
researcher
and
now
what
deep
was
he
to
construct
from
them
the
researcher
found
himself
at
fault
yet
stay
one
fact
had
escaped
his
notice
while
all
the
rest
were
grouped
in
twos
and
in
threes
was
alone
while
all
tongues
were
talking
was
silent
while
all
faces
were
gay
was
gloomy
and
despondent
here
was
a
indeed
the
researcher
felt
that
a
must
be
constructed
without
delay
lady
muriel
had
just
risen
and
left
the
party
could
be
the
cause
of
his
despondency
the
theory
hardly
rose
to
the
dignity
of
a
working
hypothesis
clearly
more
facts
were
needed
the
researcher
looked
round
him
once
more
and
now
the
facts
accumulated
in
such
bewildering
profusion
that
the
theory
was
lost
among
them
for
lady
muriel
had
gone
to
meet
a
strange
gentleman
just
visible
in
the
distance
and
now
she
was
returning
with
him
both
of
them
talking
eagerly
and
joyfully
like
old
friends
who
have
been
long
parted
and
now
she
was
moving
from
group
to
group
introducing
the
new
hero
of
the
hour
and
he
young
tall
and
handsome
moved
gracefully
at
her
side
with
the
erect
bearing
and
firm
tread
of
a
soldier
verily
the
theory
looked
gloomy
for
arthur
his
eye
caught
mine
and
he
crossed
to
me

very

said

muttered
arthur
then
smiled
at
his
own
bitter
words
no

heard
me

look
returned
to

and
i
could
see
it
was
only
to
distract
his
thoughts
that
he
took
his
place
at
the
side
of
the
metaphysical
young
lady
and
resumed
their
interrupted
discussion
of

he
began
you
really

no

in

as
a

of
involution

from

coherent
homogeneity
to
indefinite
incoherent
heterogeneity

as
i
was
at

jumble

had
made

kept
as
grave
a

as
i
could

she
confidently
replied
i

would
you
the
difficulty
said
arthur
you
accept
it
as
is
it
as
obvious
for

as
that
that
are
greater
than
the
same
are
greater
than
one
mind
she
modestly
replied
seems
as
obvious
i
grasp
truths
by
intuition
but
minds
may
need
some
forget
the
technical
a
logical
argument
arthur
began
with
admirable
solemnity
need
two
prim
course
she
interrupted
remember
that
word
now
and
they
delusion
said
arthur
she
said
dubiously
seem
to
remember
that
so
well
but
what
is
the
argument
called
yes
i
remember
now
but
i
need
a
sillygism
you
know
to
prove
that
mathematical
axiom
you
to
prove
that
angles
are
i
suppose
of
course
not
one
takes
such
a
simple
truth
as
that
for
granted
here
i
ventured
to
interpose
and
to
offer
her
a
plate
of
strawberries
and
cream
i
felt
really
uneasy
at
the
thought
that
she
detect
the
trick
and
i
contrived
unperceived
by
her
to
shake
my
head
reprovingly
at
the
equally
unperceived
by
her
arthur
slightly
raised
his
shoulders
and
spread
his
hands
abroad
as
who
should
say
else
can
i
say
to
her
and
moved
away
leaving
her
to
discuss
her
strawberries
by
or
any
other
way
she
preferred
by
this
time
the
carriages
that
were
to
convey
the
revelers
to
their
respective
homes
had
begun
to
assemble
outside
the
and
it
became
that
lady
cousin
had
joined
our
the
problem
how
to
convey
five
people
to
elveston
with
a
carriage
that
would
only
hold
four
must
somehow
be
solved
the
honorable
eric
lindon
who
was
at
this
moment
walking
up
and
down
with
lady
muriel
might
have
solved
it
at
once
no
doubt
by
announcing
his
intention
of
returning
on
foot
of
solution
there
did
not
seem
to
be
the
very
smallest
probability
the
next
best
solution
it
seemed
to
me
was
that
should
walk
home
and
this
i
at
once
proposed
sure
you
mind
said
the
earl
afraid
the
carriage
take
us
all
and
i
like
to
suggest
to
eric
to
desert
his
cousin
so
far
from
minding
it
i
said
should
prefer
it
it
will
give
me
time
to
sketch
this
beautiful
old
keep
you
company
arthur
suddenly
said
and
in
answer
to
what
i
suppose
was
a
look
of
surprise
on
my
face
he
said
in
a
low
voice
would
rather
i
shall
be
quite
in
the
carriage
think
walk
too
said
the
earl
have
to
be
content
with
as
your
escort
he
added
to
lady
muriel
who
had
joined
us
while
he
was
speaking
must
be
as
entertaining
as
gentlemen
rolled
into
lady
muriel
said
to
her
companion
will
be
a
grand
military
exploit
sort
of
forlorn
hope
the
captain
modestly
suggested
pay
pretty
compliments
laughed
his
fair
cousin
day
to
you
gentlemen
rather
deserters
three
and
the
two
young
folk
entered
the
carriage
and
were
driven
away
long
will
your
sketch
take
said
arthur
i
said
should
like
an
hour
for
it
you
think
you
had
better
go
without
me
return
by
train
i
know
one
in
about
an
that
be
best
said
the
earl
station
is
quite
so
i
was
left
to
my
own
devices
and
soon
found
a
comfortable
seat
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
from
which
i
had
a
good
view
of
the
ruins
is
a
very
drowsy
day
i
said
to
myself
idly
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
to
find
a
blank
page
i
thought
you
were
a
mile
off
by
this
time
for
to
my
surprise
the
two
walkers
were
back
again
came
back
to
remind
you
arthur
said
the
trains
go
every
ten
i
said
the
metropolitan
railway
the
metropolitan
railway
the
earl
insisted
is
a
part
of
do
you
talk
with
your
eyes
shut
said
arthur
up
think
the
heat
makes
me
so
drowsy
i
said
hoping
but
not
feeling
quite
sure
that
i
was
talking
sense
i
awake
now
think
the
earl
judicially
pronounced
do
think
doctor
only
got
one
eye
open
snoring
like
anything
cried
bruno
wake
up
you
dear
old
thing
and
he
and
sylvie
set
to
work
rolling
the
heavy
head
from
side
to
side
as
if
its
connection
with
the
shoulders
was
a
matter
of
no
sort
of
importance
and
at
last
the
professor
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
blinking
at
us
with
eyes
of
utter
bewilderment
you
have
the
kindness
to
mention
he
said
addressing
me
with
his
usual
courtesy
we
are
just
we
are
beginning
with
me
i
thought
it
best
to
begin
with
the
children
is
sylvie
sir
and
is
yes
i
know
well
enough
the
old
man
murmured
most
anxious
about
and
perhaps
be
good
enough
to
mention
at
the
same
time
how
i
got
here
harder
problem
occurs
to
i
ventured
to
say
that
is
how
to
get
back
true
the
professor
replied
problem
no
doubt
viewed
a
problem
outside
of
oneself
it
is
a
interesting
one
viewed
as
a
portion
of
own
biography
it
is
i
must
admit
very
distressing
he
groaned
but
instantly
added
with
a
chuckle
to
i
think
you
mentioned
that
i
the
bruno
shouted
in
his
ear
oo
know
come
from
and
so
far
away
from
here
the
professor
leapt
to
his
feet
with
the
agility
of
a
boy
no
time
to
lose
he
exclaimed
anxiously
just
ask
this
guileless
peasant
with
his
brace
of
buckets
that
contain
apparently
water
if
be
so
kind
as
to
direct
us
guileless
peasant
he
proceeded
in
a
louder
voice
you
tell
us
the
way
to
outland
the
guileless
peasant
turned
with
a
sheepish
grin
was
all
he
said
the
professor
repeated
the
guileless
peasant
set
down
his
buckets
and
considered
ought
to
mention
the
professor
hastily
put
in
whatever
you
say
will
be
used
in
evidence
against
the
guileless
peasant
instantly
resumed
his
buckets
ah
says
nowt
he
answered
briskly
and
walked
away
at
a
great
pace
the
children
gazed
sadly
at
the
rapidly
vanishing
figure
goes
very
quick
the
professor
said
with
a
sigh
i
that
was
the
right
thing
to
say
studied
your
english
laws
however
ask
this
next
man
coming
he
is
guileless
and
he
is
a
i
know
that
either
point
is
of
vital
it
was
in
fact
the
honourable
eric
lindon
who
had
apparently
fulfilled
his
task
of
escorting
lady
muriel
home
and
was
now
strolling
leisurely
up
and
down
the
road
outside
the
house
enjoying
a
solitary
cigar
i
trouble
you
sir
to
tell
us
the
nearest
way
to
outland
oddity
as
he
was
in
outward
appearance
the
professor
was
in
that
essential
nature
which
no
outward
disguise
could
conceal
a
thorough
gentleman
and
as
such
eric
lindon
accepted
him
instantly
he
took
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
delicately
shook
off
the
ash
while
he
considered
name
sounds
strange
to
me
he
said
doubt
if
i
can
help
is
not
far
from
the
professor
suggested
eric
were
slightly
raised
at
these
words
and
an
amused
smile
which
he
courteously
tried
to
repress
flitted
across
his
handsome
face
trifle
he
muttered
to
himself
what
a
jolly
old
patriarch
it
is
then
he
turned
to
the
children
help
him
little
folk
he
said
with
a
gentleness
of
tone
that
seemed
to
win
their
hearts
at
once
know
all
about
it
many
miles
to
babylon
miles
and
ten
can
i
get
there
by
candlelight
yes
and
back
again
to
my
surprise
bruno
ran
forwards
to
him
as
if
he
were
some
old
friend
of
theirs
seized
the
disengaged
hand
and
hung
on
to
it
with
both
of
his
own
and
there
stood
this
tall
dignified
officer
in
the
middle
of
the
road
gravely
swinging
a
little
boy
to
and
fro
while
sylvie
stood
ready
to
push
him
exactly
as
if
a
real
swing
had
suddenly
been
provided
for
their
pastime
want
to
get
to
oo
know
bruno
explained
as
he
swung
it
sylvie
added
giving
the
swing
a
push
of
extra
vigour
which
nearly
took
the
whole
machine
off
its
balance
by
this
time
it
was
clear
to
me
that
eric
lindon
was
quite
unconscious
of
my
presence
even
the
professor
and
the
children
seemed
to
have
lost
sight
of
me
and
i
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
group
as
unconcernedly
as
a
ghost
seeing
but
unseen
perfectly
isochronous
the
professor
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
he
had
his
watch
in
his
hand
and
was
carefully
counting
oscillations
measures
time
quite
as
accurately
as
a
pendulum
illustration
perfectly
isochronous
even
pendulums
the
young
soldier
observed
as
he
carefully
released
his
hand
from
grasp
not
a
joy
come
enough
for
one
bout
little
man
next
time
we
meet
you
shall
have
another
meanwhile
better
take
this
old
gentleman
to
queer
street
find
it
cried
bruno
eagerly
as
they
dragged
the
professor
away
are
much
indebted
to
you
the
professor
said
looking
over
his
shoulder
mention
it
replied
the
officer
raising
his
hat
as
a
parting
salute
number
did
you
say
the
professor
called
from
the
distance
the
officer
made
a
trumpet
of
his
two
hands
he
shouted
in
stentorian
tones
not
by
any
means
he
added
to
himself
a
mad
world
my
masters
a
mad
world
he
lit
another
cigar
and
strolled
on
towards
his
hotel
a
lovely
evening
i
said
joining
him
as
he
passed
me
indeed
he
said
did
come
from
dropped
from
the
clouds
strolling
your
way
i
said
and
no
further
explanation
seemed
necessary
a
cigar
not
a
there
a
lunatic
asylum
near
here
that
i
know
there
might
be
met
a
lunatic
just
now
queer
old
fish
as
ever
i
saw
and
so
in
friendly
chat
we
took
our
homeward
ways
and
wished
each
other
at
the
door
of
his
hotel
left
to
myself
i
felt
the
feeling
rush
over
me
again
and
saw
standing
at
the
door
of
number
forty
the
three
figures
i
knew
so
well
the
wrong
house
bruno
was
saying
no
the
right
the
professor
cheerfully
replied
the
wrong
where
made
our
mistake
our
best
plan
now
will
be
it
was
over
the
street
was
empty
commonplace
life
was
around
me
and
the
feeling
had
fled
chapter
xix
how
to
make
a
phlizz
the
week
passed
without
any
further
communication
with
the
as
arthur
was
evidently
fearful
that
we
might
out
our
but
when
on
sunday
morning
we
were
setting
out
for
church
i
gladly
agreed
to
his
proposal
to
go
round
and
enquire
after
the
earl
who
was
said
to
be
unwell
eric
who
was
strolling
in
the
garden
gave
us
a
good
report
of
the
invalid
who
was
still
in
bed
with
lady
muriel
in
attendance
you
coming
with
us
to
church
i
enquired
no
he
courteously
replied
my
line
you
know
an
excellent
the
when
with
my
own
folk
i
go
just
to
set
them
an
example
but
not
known
so
i
think
excuse
myself
sitting
out
a
sermon
are
always
so
dull
arthur
was
silent
till
we
were
out
of
hearing
then
he
said
to
himself
almost
inaudibly
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
am
i
in
the
midst
of
i
assented
doubt
that
the
principle
on
which
when
he
go
he
continued
our
thoughts
ran
so
much
together
that
our
conversation
was
often
slightly
elliptical
suppose
he
repeats
the
words
believe
in
the
communion
of
but
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
little
church
into
which
a
goodly
stream
of
worshipers
consisting
mainly
of
fishermen
and
their
families
was
flowing
the
service
would
have
been
pronounced
by
any
modern
æsthetic
religious
æsthete
which
is
it
be
crude
and
cold
to
me
coming
fresh
from
the
developments
of
a
london
church
under
a
rector
it
was
unspeakably
refreshing
there
was
no
theatrical
procession
of
demure
little
choristers
trying
their
best
not
to
simper
under
the
admiring
gaze
of
the
congregation
the
share
in
the
service
was
taken
by
the
people
themselves
unaided
except
that
a
few
good
voices
judiciously
posted
here
and
there
among
them
kept
the
singing
from
going
too
far
astray
there
was
no
murdering
of
the
noble
music
contained
in
the
bible
and
the
liturgy
by
its
recital
in
a
dead
monotone
with
no
more
expression
than
a
mechanical
no
the
prayers
were
the
lessons
were
of
sermon
was
and
i
found
myself
repeating
as
we
left
the
church
the
words
of
jacob
when
he
out
of
his
the
lord
is
in
this
place
this
is
none
other
but
the
house
of
god
and
this
is
the
gate
of
said
arthur
apparently
in
answer
to
my
thoughts
services
are
fast
becoming
pure
formalism
more
and
more
the
people
are
beginning
to
regard
them
as
in
which
they
only
in
the
french
sense
and
it
is
bad
for
the
little
boys
be
much
less
as
with
all
that
and
and
exits
and
being
always
no
wonder
if
eaten
up
with
vanity
the
blatant
little
coxcombs
when
we
passed
the
hall
on
our
return
we
found
the
earl
and
lady
muriel
sitting
out
in
the
garden
eric
had
gone
for
a
stroll
we
joined
them
and
the
conversation
soon
turned
on
the
sermon
we
had
just
heard
the
subject
of
which
was
a
change
has
come
over
our
pulpits
arthur
remarked
the
time
when
paley
gave
that
utterly
selfish
definition
of
virtue
doing
good
to
mankind
in
obedience
to
the
will
of
god
and
for
the
sake
of
everlasting
lady
muriel
looked
at
him
enquiringly
but
she
seemed
to
have
learned
by
intuition
what
years
of
experience
had
taught
that
the
way
to
elicit
deepest
thoughts
was
neither
to
assent
nor
dissent
but
simply
to
that
time
he
went
on
great
tidal
wave
of
selfishness
was
sweeping
over
human
thought
right
and
wrong
had
somehow
been
transformed
into
gain
and
loss
and
religion
had
become
a
sort
of
commercial
transaction
we
may
be
thankful
that
our
preachers
are
beginning
to
take
a
nobler
view
of
is
it
not
taught
again
and
again
in
the
i
ventured
to
ask
in
the
bible
as
a
said
arthur
the
old
testament
no
doubt
rewards
and
punishments
are
constantly
appealed
to
as
motives
for
action
that
teaching
is
best
for
and
the
israelites
seem
to
have
been
mentally
children
we
guide
our
children
thus
at
first
but
we
appeal
as
soon
as
possible
to
their
innate
sense
of
right
and
wrong
and
when
stage
is
safely
past
we
appeal
to
the
highest
motive
of
all
the
desire
for
likeness
to
and
union
with
the
supreme
good
i
think
you
will
find
that
to
be
the
teaching
of
the
bible
a
beginning
with
thy
days
may
be
long
in
the
and
ending
with
ye
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
we
were
silent
for
awhile
and
then
arthur
went
off
on
another
tack
at
the
literature
of
hymns
now
how
cankered
it
is
through
and
through
with
selfishness
there
are
few
human
compositions
more
utterly
degraded
than
some
modern
hymns
i
quoted
the
stanza
lord
we
lend
to
thee
repaid
a
thousandfold
shall
be
then
gladly
will
we
give
to
thee
giver
of
all
he
said
grimly
is
the
typical
stanza
and
the
very
last
i
heard
was
infected
with
it
after
giving
many
good
reasons
for
charity
the
preacher
wound
up
with
for
all
you
give
you
will
be
repaid
a
thousandfold
oh
the
utter
meanness
of
such
a
motive
to
be
put
before
men
who
know
what
is
who
appreciate
generosity
and
heroism
talk
of
original
he
went
on
with
increasing
bitterness
you
have
a
stronger
proof
of
the
original
goodness
there
must
be
in
this
nation
than
the
fact
that
religion
has
been
preached
to
us
as
a
commercial
speculation
for
a
century
and
that
we
still
believe
in
a
god
have
gone
on
so
long
lady
muriel
musingly
remarked
the
opposition
been
practically
under
what
the
french
call
surely
in
any
or
in
private
society
such
teaching
would
soon
have
been
hooted
down
trust
so
said
arthur
though
i
want
to
see
in
legalised
i
must
say
that
our
preachers
enjoy
an
they
ill
deserve
and
which
they
misuse
terribly
we
put
our
man
into
a
pulpit
and
we
virtually
tell
him
you
may
stand
there
and
talk
to
us
for
we
interrupt
you
by
so
much
as
a
you
shall
have
it
all
your
own
way
and
what
does
he
give
us
in
return
shallow
twaddle
that
if
it
were
addressed
to
you
over
a
you
would
think
the
man
take
me
for
a
the
return
of
eric
from
his
walk
checked
the
tide
of
eloquence
and
after
a
few
talk
on
more
conventional
topics
we
took
our
leave
lady
muriel
walked
with
us
to
the
gate
have
given
me
much
to
think
about
she
said
earnestly
as
she
gave
arthur
her
hand
so
glad
you
came
in
and
her
words
brought
a
real
glow
of
pleasure
into
that
pale
worn
face
of
his
on
the
tuesday
as
arthur
did
not
seem
equal
to
more
walking
i
took
a
long
stroll
by
myself
having
stipulated
that
he
was
not
to
give
the
day
to
his
books
but
was
to
meet
me
at
the
hall
at
about
on
my
way
back
i
passed
the
station
just
as
the
came
in
sight
and
sauntered
down
the
stairs
to
see
it
come
in
but
there
was
little
to
gratify
my
idle
curiosity
and
when
the
train
was
empty
and
the
platform
clear
i
found
it
was
about
time
to
be
moving
on
if
i
meant
to
reach
the
hall
by
five
as
i
approached
the
end
of
the
platform
from
which
a
steep
irregular
wooden
staircase
conducted
to
the
upper
world
i
noticed
two
passengers
who
had
evidently
arrived
by
the
train
but
who
oddly
enough
had
entirely
escaped
my
notice
though
the
arrivals
had
been
so
few
they
were
a
young
woman
and
a
little
girl
the
former
so
far
as
one
could
judge
by
appearances
was
a
nursemaid
or
possibly
a
in
attendance
on
the
child
whose
refined
face
even
more
than
her
dress
distinguished
her
as
of
a
higher
class
than
her
companion
the
face
was
refined
but
it
was
also
a
worn
and
sad
one
and
told
a
tale
or
so
i
seemed
to
read
it
of
much
illness
and
suffering
sweetly
and
patiently
borne
she
had
a
little
crutch
to
help
herself
along
with
and
she
was
now
standing
looking
wistfully
up
the
long
staircase
and
apparently
waiting
till
she
could
muster
courage
to
begin
the
toilsome
ascent
there
are
some
things
one
in
well
as
things
one
come
automatically
by
as
the
physiologists
say
meaning
no
doubt
action
reflection
just
as
is
said
to
be
derived
non
closing
eyelids
when
something
seems
to
be
flying
into
the
eye
is
one
of
those
actions
and
saying
i
carry
the
little
girl
up
the
stairs
was
another
it
that
any
thought
of
offering
help
occurred
to
me
and
that
i
spoke
the
first
intimation
i
had
of
being
likely
to
make
that
offer
was
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
and
the
discovery
that
the
offer
had
been
made
the
servant
paused
doubtfully
glancing
from
her
charge
to
me
and
then
back
again
to
the
child
you
like
it
dear
she
asked
her
but
no
such
doubt
appeared
to
cross
the
mind
she
lifted
her
arms
eagerly
to
be
taken
up
was
all
she
said
while
a
faint
smile
flickered
on
the
weary
little
face
i
took
her
up
with
scrupulous
care
and
her
little
arm
was
at
once
clasped
trustfully
round
my
neck
illustration
the
lame
child
she
was
a
light
light
in
fact
that
the
ridiculous
idea
crossed
my
mind
that
it
was
rather
easier
going
up
with
her
in
my
arms
than
it
would
have
been
without
her
and
when
we
reached
the
road
above
with
its
and
loose
formidable
obstacles
for
a
lame
found
that
i
had
said
better
carry
her
over
this
rough
place
before
i
had
formed
any
connection
between
its
roughness
and
my
gentle
little
burden
troubling
you
too
much
sir
the
maid
exclaimed
can
walk
very
well
on
the
but
the
arm
that
was
twined
about
my
neck
clung
just
an
atom
more
closely
at
the
suggestion
and
decided
me
to
say
no
weight
really
carry
her
a
little
further
going
your
the
nurse
raised
no
further
objection
and
the
next
speaker
was
a
ragged
little
boy
with
bare
feet
and
a
broom
over
his
shoulder
who
ran
across
the
road
and
pretended
to
sweep
the
perfectly
dry
road
in
front
of
us
us
a
the
little
urchin
pleaded
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
dirty
face
give
him
a
said
the
little
lady
in
my
arms
the
sounded
harsh
but
the
was
gentleness
itself
an
little
boy
and
she
laughed
a
laugh
of
such
silvery
sweetness
as
i
had
never
yet
heard
from
any
lips
but
to
my
astonishment
the
boy
actually
in
the
laugh
as
if
there
were
some
subtle
sympathy
between
them
as
he
ran
away
down
the
road
and
vanished
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
but
he
was
back
in
a
few
moments
having
discarded
his
broom
and
provided
himself
from
some
mysterious
source
with
an
exquisite
bouquet
of
flowers
a
posy
buy
a
posy
only
a
he
chanted
with
the
melancholy
drawl
of
a
professional
beggar
buy
it
was
her
edict
as
she
looked
down
with
a
lofty
scorn
that
seemed
curiously
mixed
with
tender
interest
on
the
ragged
creature
at
her
feet
but
this
time
i
turned
rebel
and
ignored
the
royal
commands
such
lovely
flowers
and
of
forms
so
entirely
new
to
me
were
not
to
be
abandoned
at
the
bidding
of
any
little
maid
however
imperious
i
bought
the
bouquet
and
the
little
boy
after
popping
the
halfpenny
into
his
mouth
turned
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
the
human
mouth
is
really
adapted
to
serve
as
a
with
wonder
that
increased
every
moment
i
turned
over
the
flowers
and
examined
them
one
by
one
there
was
not
a
single
one
among
them
that
i
could
remember
having
ever
seen
before
at
last
i
turned
to
the
nursemaid
these
flowers
grow
wild
about
here
i
never
but
the
speech
died
away
on
my
lips
the
nursemaid
had
vanished
can
put
me
down
if
you
like
sylvie
quietly
remarked
i
obeyed
in
silence
and
could
only
ask
myself
this
a
on
finding
sylvie
and
bruno
walking
one
on
either
side
of
me
and
clinging
to
my
hands
with
the
ready
confidence
of
childhood
larger
than
when
i
saw
you
last
i
began
i
think
we
ought
to
be
introduced
again
so
much
of
you

i
never
met

merrily
replied

sylvie

against
a
telegraph
post
by
accident
and
it
went
in
two
halves
but
you
were
looking
the
other
i
felt
that
i
had
indeed
missed
an
opportunity
to
witness
such
an
event
as

nursemaid

laughed
merrily
as
i
turned
hastily
from

to
side
looking
in
all
directions
for
the
speaker

he
gleefully
proclaimed
in
his

voice

chapter

light
come
light
go
lady
smile
of
welcome
could
not
conceal
the
look
of
surprise
with
which
she
regarded
my
new
companions
i
presented
them
in
due
form
is
lady
muriel
and
this
is
surname
she
enquired
her
eyes
twinkling
with
fun
i
said
gravely
she
laughed
evidently
thinking
i
said
it
in
fun
and
stooped
to
kiss
the
salute
to
which
submitted
with
reluctance
returned
it
with
interest
while
she
and
arthur
who
had
arrived
before
me
supplied
the
children
with
tea
and
cake
i
tried
to
engage
the
earl
in
conversation
but
he
was
restless
and
and
we
made
little
progress
at
last
by
a
sudden
question
he
betrayed
the
cause
of
his
disquiet
you
let
me
look
at
those
flowers
you
have
in
your
hand
i
said
handing
him
the
bouquet
botany
was
i
knew
a
favourite
study
of
his
and
these
flowers
were
to
me
so
entirely
new
and
mysterious
that
i
was
really
curious
to
see
what
a
botanist
would
say
of
them
they
did
diminish
his
disquiet
on
the
contrary
he
became
every
moment
more
excited
as
he
turned
them
over
are
all
from
central
india
he
said
laying
aside
part
of
the
bouquet
are
rare
even
there
and
i
have
never
seen
them
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
two
are
he
rose
hastily
and
carried
it
to
the
window
to
examine
it
in
a
better
light
the
flush
of
excitement
mounting
to
his
very
forehead
i
am
nearly
i
have
a
book
of
indian
botany
he
took
a
volume
from
the
and
turned
the
leaves
with
trembling
fingers
compare
it
with
this
picture
it
is
the
exact
duplicate
this
is
the
flower
of
the
which
usually
grows
only
in
the
depths
of
forests
and
the
flower
fades
so
quickly
after
being
plucked
that
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
keep
its
form
or
colour
even
so
far
as
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
yet
this
is
in
full
bloom
did
you
get
these
flowers
he
added
with
breathless
eagerness
i
glanced
at
sylvie
who
gravely
and
silently
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
then
beckoned
to
bruno
to
follow
her
and
ran
out
into
the
garden
and
i
found
myself
in
the
position
of
a
defendant
whose
two
most
important
witnesses
have
been
suddenly
taken
away
me
give
you
the
flowers
i
stammered
out
at
last
quite
my
as
to
how
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
know
much
more
about
them
than
i
do
accept
them
most
gratefully
but
you
have
not
yet
told
the
earl
was
beginning
when
we
were
interrupted
to
my
great
relief
by
the
arrival
of
eric
lindon
to
however
the
was
i
saw
clearly
anything
but
welcome
his
face
clouded
over
he
drew
a
little
back
from
the
circle
and
took
no
further
part
in
the
conversation
which
was
wholly
maintained
for
some
minutes
by
lady
muriel
and
her
lively
cousin
who
were
discussing
some
new
music
that
had
just
arrived
from
london
just
try
this
one
he
pleaded
music
looks
easy
to
sing
at
sight
and
the
quite
appropriate
to
the
i
suppose
tea
ever
to
thee
faithful
be
five
tea
laughed
lady
muriel
as
she
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
lightly
struck
a
few
random
chords
quite
and
yet
it
a
kind
of
to
thee
faithful
be
a
pair
of
hapless
lovers
crosses
the
briny
deep
and
is
left
is
appropriate
she
replied
mockingly
as
he
placed
the
song
before
her
am
to
do
the
lamenting
and
who
for
if
you
please
she
played
the
air
once
or
twice
through
first
in
quick
and
finally
in
slow
time
and
then
gave
us
the
whole
song
with
as
much
graceful
ease
as
if
she
had
been
familiar
with
it
all
her
life
stept
so
lightly
to
the
land
all
in
his
manly
pride
he
kissed
her
cheek
he
pressed
her
hand
yet
still
she
glanced
aside
gay
he
seems
she
darkly
dreams
gallant
and
too
gay
to
think
of
simple
when
he
is
far
away
bring
my
love
this
goodly
pearl
across
the
seas
he
said
gem
to
deck
the
dearest
girl
that
ever
sailor
wed
she
clasps
it
tight
her
eyes
are
bright
her
throbbing
heart
would
say
thought
of
thought
of
when
he
was
far
away
the
ship
has
sailed
into
the
west
her
is
flown
a
dull
dead
pain
is
in
her
breast
and
she
is
weak
and
lone
yet
a
smile
upon
her
face
a
smile
that
seems
to
say
think
of
think
of
when
he
is
far
away
waters
wide
between
us
glide
our
lives
are
warm
and
near
no
distance
parts
two
faithful
two
hearts
that
love
so
dear
and
i
will
trust
my
for
ever
and
a
day
to
think
of
think
of
when
he
is
far
away
the
look
of
displeasure
which
had
begun
to
come
over
face
when
the
young
captain
spoke
of
love
so
lightly
faded
away
as
the
song
proceeded
and
he
listened
with
evident
delight
but
his
face
darkened
again
when
eric
demurely
remarked
you
think
would
have
fitted
the
tune
just
as
well
so
it
would
lady
muriel
gaily
retorted
sailors
tinkers
tailors
what
a
lot
of
words
would
fit
in
i
think
sounds
best
to
spare
my
friend
further
pain
i
rose
to
go
just
as
the
earl
was
beginning
to
repeat
his
particularly
embarrassing
question
about
the
flowers
have
not
some
tea
thank
you
i
hastily
interrupted
him
now
we
really
be
going
good
evening
lady
muriel
and
we
made
our
adieux
and
escaped
while
the
earl
was
still
absorbed
in
examining
the
mysterious
bouquet
lady
muriel
accompanied
us
to
the
door
have
given
my
father
a
more
acceptable
present
she
said
warmly
is
so
passionately
fond
of
botany
afraid
know
nothing
of
the
of
it
but
i
keep
his
in
order
i
must
get
some
sheets
of
and
dry
these
new
treasures
for
him
before
they
be
no
good
at
all
said
bruno
who
was
waiting
for
us
in
the
garden
it
said
i
know
i
to
give
the
flowers
to
stop
it
be
helped
said
sylvie
they
be
sorry
when
they
find
them
gone
how
will
they
go
i
know
but
they
go
the
nosegay
was
only
a
you
know
bruno
made
it
these
last
words
were
in
a
whisper
as
she
evidently
did
not
wish
arthur
to
hear
but
of
this
there
seemed
to
be
little
risk
he
hardly
seemed
to
notice
the
children
but
paced
on
silent
and
abstracted
and
when
at
the
entrance
to
the
wood
they
bid
us
a
hasty
farewell
and
ran
off
he
seemed
to
wake
out
of
a
the
bouquet
vanished
as
sylvie
had
predicted
and
when
a
day
or
two
afterwards
arthur
and
i
once
more
visited
the
hall
we
found
the
earl
and
his
daughter
with
the
old
housekeeper
out
in
the
garden
examining
the
fastenings
of
the
window
are
holding
an
inquest
lady
muriel
said
advancing
to
meet
us
we
admit
you
as
accessories
before
the
fact
to
tell
us
all
you
know
about
those
accessories
before
the
fact
decline
to
answer
questions
i
gravely
replied
they
reserve
their
then
turn
evidence
please
the
flowers
have
disappeared
in
the
night
she
went
on
turning
to
arthur
we
are
sure
no
one
in
the
house
has
meddled
with
them
somebody
must
have
entered
by
the
the
fastenings
have
not
been
tampered
with
said
the
earl
must
have
been
while
you
were
dining
my
lady
said
the
housekeeper
was
it
said
the
earl
thief
must
have
seen
you
bring
the
flowers
turning
to
me
have
noticed
that
you
did
take
them
away
and
he
must
have
known
their
great
are
simply
he
exclaimed
in
sudden
excitement
you
never
told
us
how
you
got
them
said
lady
muriel
day
i
stammered
may
be
free
to
tell
you
just
now
would
you
excuse
me
the
earl
looked
disappointed
but
kindly
said
well

ask

tea
we
consider
you
a
bad
evidence
lady
muriel
added
playfully
as
we
entered
the
arbour
pronounce
you
to
be
an
accomplice
and
we
sentence
you
to
solitary
confinement
and
to
be
fed
on
bread
do
you
take
sugar
is
disquieting
certainly
she
resumed
when
all
had
been
duly
supplied
find
that
the
house
has
been
entered
by
a
this
place
if
only
the
flowers
had
been
one
might
have
suspected
a
thief
of
quite
another
mean
that
universal
explanation
for
all
mysterious
disappearances
did
said
arthur
she
replied
a
convenient
thing
it
would
be
if
all
thieves
had
the
same
shape
so
confusing
to
have
some
of
them
quadrupeds
and
others
bipeds
has
occurred
to
me
said
arthur
a
curious
problem
in
science
of
final
causes
he
added
in
answer
to
an
enquiring
look
from
lady
muriel
a
final
cause
suppose
we
last
of
a
series
of
connected
of
the
series
being
the
cause
of
the
whose
sake
the
first
event
takes
the
last
event
is
practically
an
of
the
first
it
and
yet
you
call
it
a
of
it
arthur
pondered
a
moment
words
are
rather
confusing
i
grant
you
he
said
this
do
the
last
event
is
an
effect
of
the
first
but
the
for
that
event
is
a
cause
of
the
for
the
seems
clear
enough
said
lady
muriel
let
us
have
the
merely
this
what
object
can
we
imagine
in
the
arrangement
by
which
each
different
size
roughly
speaking
of
living
creatures
has
its
special
shape
for
instance
the
human
race
has
one
kind
of
another
set
ranging
from
the
lion
to
the
mouse
are
quadrupeds
go
down
a
step
or
two
further
and
you
come
to
insects
with
six
beautiful
name
is
it
not
but
beauty
in
our
sense
of
the
word
seems
to
diminish
as
we
go
down
the
creature
becomes
say
of
any
of
uncouth
and
when
we
take
the
microscope
and
go
a
few
steps
lower
still
we
come
upon
animalculæ
terribly
uncouth
and
with
a
terrible
number
of
legs
other
alternative
said
the
earl
be
a
series
of
repetitions
of
the
same
type
never
mind
the
monotony
of
it
see
how
it
would
work
in
other
ways
begin
with
the
race
of
men
and
the
creatures
they
require
let
us
say
horses
cattle
sheep
and
exactly
require
frogs
and
spiders
do
we
muriel
lady
muriel
shuddered
perceptibly
it
was
evidently
a
painful
subject
can
dispense
with
she
said
gravely
then
have
a
second
race
of
men
would
have
source
of
exquisite
enjoyment
not
possessed
by
ordinary
men
arthur
interrupted
source
said
the
earl
the
grandeur
of
scenery
surely
the
grandeur
of
a
mountain
to
depends
on
its
relative
to
me
double
the
height
of
the
mountain
and
of
course
twice
as
grand
halve
height
and
you
produce
the
same
happy
happy
small
lady
muriel
murmured
rapturously
but
the
short
none
but
the
short
none
but
the
short
enjoy
the
tall
let
me
go
on
said
the
earl
have
a
third
race
of
men
five
inches
high
a
fourth
race
an
inch
eat
common
beef
and
mutton
sure
lady
muriel
interrupted
my
child
i
was
forgetting
each
set
must
have
its
own
cattle
and
its
own
vegetation
i
added
could
a
cow
an
inch
high
do
with
grass
that
waved
far
above
its
head
is
true
we
must
have
a
pasture
within
a
pasture
so
to
speak
the
common
grass
would
serve
our
cows
as
a
green
forest
of
palms
while
round
the
root
of
each
tall
stem
would
stretch
a
tiny
carpet
of
microscopic
grass
yes
i
think
our
scheme
will
work
fairly
well
and
it
would
be
very
interesting
coming
into
contact
with
the
races
below
us
what
sweet
little
things
the
would
be
i
doubt
if
even
would
run
away
from
one
of
them
you
think
we
ought
to
have
a
series
as
well
said
lady
muriel
fancy
being
a
hundred
yards
high
one
could
use
an
elephant
as
a
and
a
crocodile
as
a
pair
of
scissors
would
you
have
races
of
different
sizes
communicate
with
one
another
i
enquired
they
make
war
on
one
another
for
instance
or
enter
into
treaties
we
must
exclude
i
think
when
you
could
crush
a
whole
nation
with
one
blow
of
your
fist
you
conduct
war
on
equal
terms
but
anything
involving
a
collision
of
only
would
be
possible
in
our
ideal
of
course
we
must
allow
powers
to
all
irrespective
of
size
perhaps
the
fairest
rule
would
be
that
the
the
race
the
should
be
its
intellectual
development
you
mean
to
say
said
lady
muriel
these
manikins
of
an
inch
high
are
to
with
me
surely
said
the
earl
argument
depend
for
its
logical
force
on
the
of
the
creature
that
utters
it
she
tossed
her
head
indignantly
would
argue
with
any
man
less
than
six
inches
high
she
cried
make
him
at
said
arthur
listening
to
all
this
nonsense
with
an
amused
smile
she
readily
replied
embroidery
they
would
do
if
they
did
it
wrong
i
said
the
question
i
know
but
i
agree
that
it
be
reason
is
said
lady
muriel
sacrifice
so
course
one
echoed
arthur
more
than
one
could
argue
with
a
potato
it
would
be
the
ancient
doubt
it
said
i
a
pun
convince
if
that
is
the
reason
said
lady
muriel
reason
would
you
give
i
tried
hard
to
understand
the
meaning
of
this
question
but
the
persistent
humming
of
the
bees
confused
me
and
there
was
a
drowsiness
in
the
air
that
made
every
thought
stop
and
go
to
sleep
before
it
had
got
well
thought
out
so
all
i
could
say
was
must
depend
on
the
of
the
i
felt
the
remark
was
not
so
sensible
as
i
should
have
liked
it
to
be
but
lady
muriel
seemed
to
take
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
that
she
began
but
suddenly
started
and
turned
away
to
listen
you
hear
him
she
said
crying
we
must
go
to
him
and
i
said
to
myself
very
strange
i
quite
thought
it
was
talking
to
me
why
all
the
while
and
i
made
another
great
effort
to
say
something
that
should
have
some
meaning
in
it
it
about
the
potato
chapter
xxi
through
the
ivory
door
know
said
sylvie
i
must
think
i
could
go
to
him
by
myself
well
enough
but
i
want
to
come
me
go
with
you
i
pleaded
can
walk
as
fast
as
can
sylvie
laughed
merrily
nonsense
she
cried
you
walk
a
bit
lying
quite
flat
on
your
back
you
understand
these
can
walk
as
well
as
can
i
repeated
and
i
tried
my
best
to
walk
a
few
steps
but
the
ground
slipped
away
backwards
quite
as
fast
as
i
could
walk
so
that
i
made
no
progress
at
all
sylvie
laughed
again
i
told
you
so
no
idea
how
funny
you
look
moving
your
feet
about
in
the
air
as
if
you
were
walking
wait
a
bit
ask
the
professor
what
better
and
she
knocked
at
his
the
door
opened
and
the
professor
looked
out
that
crying
i
heard
just
now
he
asked
it
a
human
animal
a
boy
sylvie
said
afraid
been
teasing
him
i
sylvie
said
very
earnestly
tease
him
i
must
ask
the
other
professor
about
he
went
back
into
the
study
and
we
heard
him
whispering
human
she
been
teasing
kind
called
her
boy
said
a
new
voice
the
professor
came
out
again
boy
is
it
that
you
been
teasing
sylvie
looked
at
me
with
twinkling
eyes
dear
old
thing
she
exclaimed
standing
on
tiptoe
to
kiss
him
while
he
gravely
stooped
to
receive
the
salute
you
puzzle
me
why
there
are
boys
i
been
teasing
the
professor
returned
to
his
friend
and
this
time
the
voice
said
her
to
bring
them
of
them
and
i
sylvie
exclaimed
the
moment
he
reappeared
crying
and
my
brother
and
please
we
want
to
go
he
walk
you
know
you
this
in
a
whisper
for
fear
of
hurting
my
feelings
go
through
the
ivory
door
ask
him
said
the
professor
disappearing
again
he
returned
directly
says
you
may
follow
me
and
walk
on
the
difficulty
with
me
would
have
been
just
then
to
walk
on
it
seemed
very
hard
to
reach
down
far
enough
to
just
touch
the
floor
as
sylvie
led
me
through
the
study
the
professor
went
before
us
to
unlock
the
ivory
door
i
had
just
time
to
glance
at
the
other
professor
who
was
sitting
reading
with
his
back
to
us
before
the
professor
showed
us
out
through
the
door
and
locked
it
behind
us
bruno
was
standing
with
his
hands
over
his
face
crying
bitterly
illustration
the
matter
darling
the
matter
darling
said
sylvie
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
mine
self
much
sobbed
the
poor
little
fellow
sorry
darling
how
ever
you
manage
to
hurt
yourself
so
i
managed
it
said
bruno
laughing
through
his
tears
oo
think
nobody
else
but
manage
things
matters
were
looking
distinctly
brighter
now
bruno
had
begun
to
argue
hear
all
about
it
i
said
foot
took
it
into
its
head
to
bruno
began
foot
got
a
head
sylvie
put
in
but
all
in
vain
slipted
down
the
bank
and
i
tripted
over
a
stone
and
the
stone
hurted
my
foot
and
i
trod
on
a
bee
and
the
bee
stinged
my
finger
poor
bruno
sobbed
again
the
complete
list
of
woes
was
too
much
for
his
feelings
it
knewed
i
to
trod
on
it
he
added
as
the
climax
bee
should
be
ashamed
of
itself
i
said
severely
and
sylvie
hugged
and
kissed
the
wounded
hero
till
all
tears
were
dried
quite
unstung
now
said
bruno
doos
there
be
stones
mister
sir
doos
oo
know
good
for
i
said
if
we
know
the
good
of
now
said
bruno
ever
so
pretty
and
stones
pretty
one
bit
would
oo
like
some
dindledums
mister
sir
sylvie
murmured
reproachfully
say
and
both
at
once
remember
what
i
told
you
telled
me
i
were
to
say
when
i
spoked
him
and
i
were
to
say
when
i
spoked
him
not
doing
you
but
i
doing
bofe
miss
praticular
bruno
exclaimed
triumphantly
wishted
to
speak
the
i
wishted
to
speak
the
gemplun
so
a
course
i
said
all
right
bruno
i
said
all
right
said
bruno
just
knows
nuffin
at
all
never
an
impertinenter
boy
said
sylvie
frowning
till
her
bright
eyes
were
nearly
invisible
there
never
was
an
ignoranter
girl
retorted
bruno
along
and
pick
some
dindledums
all
fit
for
he
added
in
a
very
loud
whisper
to
me
why
do
you
say
bruno
is
the
right
because
he
jumps
about
so
sylvie
said
laughing
it
bruno
assented
tells
me
the
words
and
then
when
i
jump
about
they
get
shooken
up
in
my
all
froth
i
expressed
myself
as
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
explanation
you
going
to
pick
me
any
dindledums
after
all
we
will
cried
bruno
along
sylvie
and
the
happy
children
raced
away
bounding
over
the
turf
with
the
fleetness
and
grace
of
young
antelopes
you
find
your
way
back
to
outland
i
said
to
the
professor
yes
i
did
he
replied
never
got
to
queer
street
but
i
found
another
way
been
backwards
and
forwards
several
times
since
then
i
had
to
be
present
at
the
election
you
know
as
the
author
of
the
new
the
emperor
was
so
kind
as
to
wish
that
should
have
the
credit
of
it
come
what
come
may
i
remember
the
very
words
of
the
imperial
speech
it
turn
out
that
the
warden
alive
will
bear
witness
that
the
change
in
the
coinage
is
the
doing
not
i
never
was
so
glorified
in
my
life
before
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
at
the
recollection
which
apparently
was
not
a
pleasant
one
the
warden
supposed
to
be
so
but
mind
you
believe
it
the
evidence
is
a
wandering
jester
with
a
they
found
their
way
into
the
palace
one
day
has
been
telling
people
he
comes
from
fairyland
and
that
the
warden
died
there
wanted
the
to
question
him
but
most
unluckily
he
and
my
lady
were
always
out
walking
when
the
jester
came
round
yes
the
supposed
to
be
dead
and
more
tears
trickled
down
the
old
cheeks
what
is
the
new
the
professor
brightened
up
again
emperor
started
the
thing
he
said
wanted
to
make
everybody
in
outland
twice
as
rich
as
he
was
to
make
the
new
government
popular
only
there
nearly
enough
money
in
the
treasury
to
do
it
so
suggested
that
he
might
do
it
by
doubling
the
value
of
every
coin
and
in
outland
the
simplest
thing
possible
i
wonder
nobody
ever
thought
of
it
before
and
you
never
saw
such
universal
joy
the
shops
are
full
from
morning
to
night
buying
everything
how
was
the
glorifying
done
a
sudden
gloom
overcast
the
jolly
face
did
it
as
i
went
home
after
the
election
he
mournfully
replied
was
kindly
i
like
it
they
waved
flags
all
round
me
till
i
was
nearly
blind
and
they
rang
bells
till
i
was
nearly
deaf
and
they
strewed
the
road
so
thick
with
flowers
that
i
lost
my
way
and
the
poor
old
man
sighed
deeply
far
is
it
to
outland
i
asked
to
change
the
subject
five
march
but
one
go
you
see
as
i
have
to
be
in
attendance
on
prince
uggug
the
empress
would
be
angry
if
i
left
him
even
for
an
surely
every
time
you
come
here
you
are
absent
ten
days
at
least
more
than
that
the
professor
exclaimed
fortnight
sometimes
but
of
course
i
keep
a
memorandum
of
the
exact
time
when
i
started
so
that
i
can
put
the
back
to
the
very
moment
me
i
said
silently
the
professor
drew
from
his
pocket
a
square
gold
watch
with
six
or
eight
hands
and
held
it
out
for
my
inspection
he
began
an
outlandish
i
should
have
has
the
peculiar
property
that
instead
of
going
with
the
the
goes
with
i
trust
you
understand
me
now
i
said
me
to
explain
so
long
as
it
is
let
alone
it
takes
its
own
course
time
has
effect
upon
have
known
such
watches
i
remarked
of
course
at
the
usual
rate
only
the
time
has
to
go
it
hence
if
i
move
the
hands
i
change
the
time
to
move
them
in
of
the
true
time
is
impossible
but
i
can
move
them
as
much
as
a
month
is
the
limit
and
then
you
have
the
events
all
over
any
alterations
experience
may
a
blessing
such
a
watch
would
be
i
thought
real
life
to
be
able
to
unsay
some
heedless
undo
some
reckless
deed
might
i
see
the
thing
done
pleasure
said
the
good
natured
professor
i
move
hand
back
to
pointing
out
the
place
goes
back
fifteen
minutes
trembling
with
excitement
i
watched
him
push
the
hand
round
as
he
described
mine
self
much
shrilly
and
suddenly
the
words
rang
in
my
ears
and
more
startled
than
i
cared
to
show
i
turned
to
look
for
the
speaker
yes
there
was
bruno
standing
with
the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
just
as
i
had
seen
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
and
there
was
sylvie
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
i
had
not
the
heart
to
make
the
dear
little
fellow
go
through
his
troubles
a
second
time
so
hastily
begged
the
professor
to
push
the
hands
round
into
their
former
position
in
a
moment
sylvie
and
bruno
were
gone
again
and
i
could
just
see
them
in
the
far
distance
picking
indeed
i
exclaimed
has
another
property
yet
more
wonderful
said
the
professor
see
this
little
peg
that
is
called
the
if
you
push
it
in
the
events
of
the
next
hour
happen
in
the
reverse
order
do
not
try
it
now
i
will
lend
you
the
watch
for
a
few
days
and
you
can
amuse
yourself
with
you
very
much
i
said
as
he
gave
me
the
watch
take
the
greatest
care
of
here
are
the
children
again
could
only
but
find
dindledums
said
bruno
putting
them
into
my
hands
sylvie
said
it
were
time
to
go
back
and
a
big
blackberry
for
we
only
find
but
you
nice
i
said
i
suppose
ate
the
other
bruno
i
bruno
said
carelessly
they
pretty
dindledums
mister
sir
very
but
what
makes
you
limp
so
my
child
come
again
bruno
mournfully
replied
and
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
began
nursing
it
the
professor
held
his
head
between
his
attitude
that
i
knew
indicated
distraction
of
mind
rest
a
minute
he
said
may
be
better
it
may
be
worse
if
only
i
had
some
of
my
medicines
here
you
know
he
added
aside
to
me
i
go
and
get
you
some
blackberries
darling
sylvie
whispered
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
she
kissed
away
a
tear
that
was
trickling
down
his
cheek
bruno
brightened
up
in
a
moment
a
good
plan
he
exclaimed
thinks
my
foot
would
come
unhurted
if
i
eated
a
or
three
or
seven
sylvie
got
up
hastily
better
go
she
said
aside
to
me
he
gets
into
the
double
figures
me
come
and
help
you
i
said
can
reach
higher
up
than
you
please
said
sylvie
putting
her
hand
into
mine
and
we
walked
off
together
blackberries
she
said
as
we
paced
slowly
along
by
a
tall
hedge
that
looked
a
promising
place
for
them
it
was
so
of
him
to
make
me
eat
the
only
one
it
was
that
ate
it
then
bruno
seem
to
like
to
tell
me
about
i
saw
that
said
sylvie
always
afraid
of
being
praised
but
he
me
eat
it
really
i
would
much
rather
that
and
she
clung
to
my
hand
as
we
came
in
sight
of
a
hare
lying
on
its
side
with
legs
stretched
out
just
in
the
entrance
to
the
wood
a
my
child
perhaps
it
asleep
sylvie
said
timidly
going
nearer
to
look
at
it
eyes
are
open
is
her
voice
dropped
to
an
awestruck
whisper
it
do
you
think
quite
dead
i
said
after
stooping
to
examine
it
thing
i
think
been
hunted
to
death
i
know
the
harriers
were
out
yesterday
but
they
touched
it
perhaps
they
caught
sight
of
another
and
left
it
to
die
of
fright
and
to
sylvie
repeated
to
herself
very
slowly
and
sadly
thought
hunting
was
a
thing
they
a
game
bruno
and
i
hunt
snails
but
we
never
hurt
them
when
we
catch
them
angel
i
thought
am
i
to
get
the
idea
of
into
your
innocent
mind
and
as
we
stood
looking
down
at
the
dead
hare
i
tried
to
put
the
thing
into
such
words
as
she
could
understand
know
what
fierce
lions
and
tigers
are
sylvie
nodded
in
some
countries
men
to
kill
them
to
save
their
own
lives
you
said
sylvie
one
tried
to
kill
bruno
would
kill
he
and
so
the
to
enjoy
it
you
know
the
running
and
the
fighting
and
the
shouting
and
the
said
sylvie
likes
but
in
country
there
any
lions
and
tigers
loose
so
they
hunt
other
creatures
you
i
hoped
but
in
vain
that
this
would
satisfy
her
and
that
she
would
ask
no
more
questions
hunt
sylvie
said
thoughtfully
i
think
they
them
too
foxes
are
very
fierce
i
daresay
men
love
them
are
hares
fierce
i
said
hare
is
a
sweet
gentle
timid
as
gentle
as
a
if
men
hares
her
voice
quivered
and
her
sweet
eyes
were
brimming
over
with
tears
afraid
they
love
them
dear
love
them
sylvie
said
ladies
love
afraid
even
go
to
hunt
them
sylvie
shuddered
no
not
she
earnestly
pleaded
lady
muriel
never
does
this
is
too
sad
a
sight
for
dear
try
and
find
but
sylvie
was
not
satisfied
yet
in
a
hushed
solemn
tone
with
bowed
head
and
clasped
hands
she
put
her
final
question
god
love
hares
i
said
he
does
he
loves
every
living
thing
even
sinful
how
much
more
the
animals
that
can
not
sin
know
what
means
said
sylvie
and
i
try
to
explain
it
my
child
i
said
trying
to
lead
her
away
to
the
poor
hare
and
come
and
look
for
poor
hare
sylvie
obediently
repeated
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
it
as
we
turned
away
and
then
all
in
a
moment
her
gave
way
pulling
her
hand
out
of
mine
she
ran
back
to
where
the
dead
hare
was
lying
and
flung
herself
down
at
its
side
in
such
an
agony
of
grief
as
i
could
hardly
have
believed
possible
in
so
young
a
child
my
darling
my
darling
she
moaned
over
and
over
again
god
meant
your
life
to
be
so
beautiful
sometimes
but
always
keeping
her
face
hidden
on
the
ground
she
would
reach
out
one
little
hand
to
stroke
the
poor
dead
thing
and
then
once
more
bury
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sob
as
if
her
heart
would
break
illustration
the
dead
hare
i
was
afraid
she
would
really
make
herself
ill
still
i
thought
it
best
to
let
her
weep
away
the
first
sharp
agony
of
grief
and
after
a
few
minutes
the
sobbing
gradually
ceased
and
sylvie
rose
to
her
feet
and
looked
calmly
at
me
though
tears
were
still
streaming
down
her
cheeks
i
did
not
dare
to
speak
again
just
yet
but
simply
held
out
my
hand
to
her
that
we
might
quit
the
melancholy
spot
come
now
she
said
very
reverently
she
kneeled
down
and
kissed
the
dead
hare
then
rose
and
gave
me
her
hand
and
we
moved
on
in
silence
a
sorrow
is
violent
but
short
and
it
was
almost
in
her
usual
voice
that
she
said
after
a
minute
stop
stop
here
are
some
blackberries
we
filled
our
hands
with
fruit
and
returned
in
all
haste
to
where
the
professor
and
bruno
were
seated
on
a
bank
awaiting
our
return
just
before
we
came
within
sylvie
checked
me
tell
about
the
hare
she
said
well
my
child
but
why
not
tears
again
glittered
in
those
sweet
eyes
and
she
turned
her
head
away
so
that
i
could
scarcely
hear
her
reply
very
of
gentle
creatures
you
know
and
be
so
sorry
i
want
him
to
be
made
agony
of
sorrow
is
to
count
for
nothing
then
sweet
unselfish
child
i
thought
to
myself
but
no
more
was
said
till
we
had
reached
our
friends
and
bruno
was
far
too
much
engrossed
in
the
feast
we
had
brought
him
to
take
any
notice
of
unusually
grave
manner
afraid
getting
rather
late
professor
i
said
indeed
said
the
professor
must
take
you
all
through
the
ivory
door
again
stayed
your
full
we
stay
a
longer
pleaded
sylvie
minute
added
bruno
but
the
professor
was
unyielding
a
great
privilege
coming
through
at
all
he
said
must
go
and
we
followed
him
obediently
to
the
ivory
door
which
he
threw
open
and
signed
to
me
to
go
through
first
coming
too
you
i
said
to
sylvie
she
said
you
see
us
after
gone
suppose
i
wait
for
you
outside
i
asked
as
i
stepped
through
the
doorway
that
case
said
sylvie
think
the
potato
would
be
justified
in
asking
weight
i
can
quite
imagine
a
really
declining
to
argue
with
any
one
under
with
a
great
effort
i
recovered
the
thread
of
my
thoughts
lapse
very
quickly
into
nonsense
i
said
chapter
xxii
crossing
the
line
us
lapse
back
again
said
lady
muriel
another
cup
of
tea
i
hope
sound
common
sense
all
that
strange
adventure
i
thought
occupied
the
space
of
a
single
comma
in
lady
speech
a
single
comma
for
which
grammarians
tell
us
to
i
felt
no
doubt
that
the
professor
had
kindly
put
back
the
time
for
me
to
the
exact
point
at
which
i
had
gone
to
sleep
when
a
few
minutes
afterwards
we
left
the
house
first
remark
was
certainly
a
strange
one
been
there
just
he
said
done
nothing
but
listen
to
you
and
lady
muriel
talking
and
yet
somehow
i
feel
exactly
as
if
had
been
talking
with
her
for
an
at
least
and
so
he
been
i
felt
no
doubt
only
as
the
time
had
been
put
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
he
referred
to
the
whole
of
it
had
passed
into
oblivion
if
not
into
nothingness
but
i
valued
my
own
reputation
for
sanity
too
highly
to
venture
on
explaining
to
what
had
happened
for
some
cause
which
i
could
not
at
the
moment
divine
arthur
was
unusually
grave
and
silent
during
our
walk
home
it
could
not
be
connected
with
eric
lindon
i
thought
as
he
had
for
some
days
been
away
in
london
so
that
having
lady
muriel
almost
to
was
only
too
glad
to
hear
those
two
conversing
to
have
any
wish
to
intrude
any
remarks
of
my
theoretically
to
have
been
specially
radiant
and
contented
with
life
he
have
heard
any
bad
news
i
said
to
myself
and
almost
as
if
he
had
read
my
thoughts
he
spoke
will
be
here
by
the
last
train
he
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
continuing
a
conversation
rather
than
beginning
one
lindon
do
you
mean
lindon
said
arthur
said
because
i
fancied
we
were
talking
about
him
the
earl
told
me
he
comes
though
is
the
day
when
he
will
know
about
the
commission
that
hoping
for
i
wonder
he
stay
another
day
to
hear
the
result
if
really
so
anxious
about
it
as
the
earl
believes
he
can
have
a
telegram
sent
after
him
i
said
not
very
running
away
from
possible
bad
news
a
very
good
fellow
said
arthur
i
confess
it
would
be
good
news
for
if
he
got
his
commission
and
his
marching
orders
all
at
once
i
wish
him
all
exception
good
night
we
had
reached
home
by
this
time
not
good
company
be
it
was
much
the
same
next
day
arthur
declared
he
fit
for
society
and
i
had
to
set
forth
alone
for
an
i
took
the
road
to
the
station
and
at
the
point
where
the
road
from
the
joined
it
i
paused
seeing
my
friends
in
the
distance
seemingly
bound
for
the
same
goal
you
join
us
the
earl
said
after
i
had
exchanged
greetings
with
him
and
lady
muriel
and
captain
lindon
restless
young
man
is
expecting
a
telegram
and
we
are
going
to
the
station
to
meet
is
also
a
restless
young
woman
in
the
case
lady
muriel
added
goes
without
saying
my
child
said
her
father
are
restless
generous
appreciation
of
all
qualities
his
daughter
impressively
remarked
nothing
to
compare
with
a
father
is
there
eric
are
not
it
said
eric
and
then
somehow
the
conversation
lapsed
into
two
duologues
the
younger
folk
taking
the
lead
and
the
two
old
men
following
with
less
eager
steps
when
are
we
to
see
your
little
friends
again
said
the
earl
are
singularly
attractive
shall
be
delighted
to
bring
them
when
i
can
i
said
i
know
myself
when
i
am
likely
to
see
them
not
going
to
question
you
said
the
earl
no
harm
in
mentioning
that
muriel
is
simply
tormented
with
curiosity
we
know
most
of
the
people
about
here
and
she
has
been
vainly
trying
to
guess
what
house
they
can
possibly
be
staying
day
i
may
be
able
to
enlighten
her
but
just
at
she
must
bear
it
as
best
she
can
tell
her
a
grand
opportunity
for
practising
but
she
hardly
sees
it
from
that
point
of
view
why
there
the
children
so
indeed
they
were
waiting
for
apparently
at
a
stile
which
they
could
not
have
climbed
over
more
than
a
few
moments
as
lady
muriel
and
her
cousin
had
passed
it
without
seeing
them
on
catching
sight
of
us
bruno
ran
to
meet
us
and
to
exhibit
to
us
with
much
pride
the
handle
of
a
blade
having
been
broken
he
had
picked
up
in
the
road
what
shall
you
use
it
for
bruno
i
said
know
bruno
carelessly
replied
first
view
of
life
the
earl
remarked
with
that
sweet
sad
smile
of
his
that
it
is
a
period
to
be
spent
in
accumulating
portable
property
that
view
gets
modified
as
the
years
glide
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
sylvie
who
had
placed
herself
by
me
looking
a
little
shy
of
him
but
the
gentle
old
man
was
not
one
with
whom
any
child
human
or
fairy
could
be
shy
for
long
and
she
had
very
soon
deserted
my
hand
for
alone
remaining
faithful
to
his
first
friend
we
overtook
the
other
couple
just
as
they
reached
the
station
and
both
lady
muriel
and
eric
greeted
the
children
as
old
latter
with
the
words
you
got
to
babylon
by
candlelight
after
all
and
back
again
cried
bruno
lady
muriel
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
blank
astonishment
know
them
eric
she
exclaimed
mystery
grows
deeper
every
day
we
must
be
somewhere
in
the
third
act
said
eric
expect
the
mystery
to
be
cleared
up
till
the
fifth
act
do
you
such
a
drama
was
the
plaintive
reply
have
got
to
the
fifth
act
by
this
time
act
i
assure
you
said
the
young
soldier
mercilessly
a
lights
down
enter
prince
in
disguise
of
course
and
faithful
attendant
is
the
taking
hand
here
stands
his
humble
servant
what
is
your
royal
next
command
and
he
made
a
most
low
bow
to
his
puzzled
little
friend
a
servant
bruno
scornfully
exclaimed
a
i
assure
your
royal
highness
eric
respectfully
insisted
me
to
mention
to
your
royal
highness
my
various
present
and
did
oo
begin
wiz
bruno
asked
beginning
to
enter
into
the
jest
oo
a
than
that
your
royal
highness
years
ago
i
offered
myself
as
a
a
slave
i
think
called
he
asked
turning
to
lady
muriel
but
lady
muriel
heard
him
not
something
had
gone
wrong
with
her
glove
which
entirely
engrossed
her
attention
oo
get
the
place
said
bruno
to
say
your
royal
highness
i
did
so
i
had
to
take
a
situation
which
i
have
now
held
for
some
i
he
again
glanced
at
lady
muriel
dear
help
me
to
button
this
glove
lady
muriel
whispered
hastily
stooping
down
and
failing
to
hear
the
question
what
will
oo
be
said
bruno
next
place
will
i
hope
be
that
of
and
after
puzzle
the
child
so
lady
muriel
interrupted
nonsense
you
talk
that
eric
persisted
hope
to
obtain
the
situation
of
act
he
proclaimed
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
turned
up
red
lights
green
lights
distant
rumble
heard
enter
a
and
in
another
minute
the
train
drew
up
alongside
of
the
platform
and
a
stream
of
passengers
began
to
flow
out
from
the
booking
office
and
you
ever
make
life
into
a
drama
said
the
earl
just
try
often
amused
myself
that
way
consider
this
platform
as
our
stage
good
entrances
and
exits
on
sides
you
see
capital
background
scene
real
engine
moving
up
and
down
all
this
bustle
and
people
passing
to
and
fro
must
have
been
most
carefully
rehearsed
how
naturally
they
do
it
with
never
a
glance
at
the
audience
and
every
grouping
is
quite
fresh
you
see
no
repetition
it
really
was
admirable
as
soon
as
i
began
to
enter
into
it
from
this
point
of
view
even
a
porter
passing
with
a
barrow
piled
with
luggage
seemed
so
realistic
that
one
was
tempted
to
applaud
he
was
followed
by
an
angry
mother
with
hot
red
face
dragging
along
two
screaming
children
and
calling
to
some
one
behind
come
on
enter
john
very
meek
very
silent
and
loaded
with
parcels
and
he
was
followed
in
his
turn
by
a
frightened
little
nursemaid
carrying
a
fat
baby
also
screaming
all
the
children
screamed
byplay
said
the
old
man
aside
you
notice
the
look
of
terror
it
was
simply
have
struck
quite
a
new
vein
i
said
most
of
us
life
and
its
pleasures
seem
like
a
mine
that
is
nearly
worked
out
exclaimed
the
earl
any
one
with
true
dramatic
instincts
it
is
only
the
overture
that
is
ended
the
real
treat
has
yet
to
begin
you
go
to
a
theatre
and
pay
your
ten
shillings
for
a
stall
and
what
do
you
get
for
your
money
perhaps
a
dialogue
between
a
couple
of
in
their
overdone
caricature
of
unnatural
in
their
constrained
attitudes
and
unnatural
in
their
attempts
at
ease
and
geniality
in
their
talk
go
instead
and
take
a
seat
in
a
and
get
the
same
dialogue
done
the
orchestra
to
block
the
nothing
to
pay
reminds
me
said
eric
is
nothing
to
pay
on
receiving
a
telegram
shall
we
enquire
for
one
and
he
and
lady
muriel
strolled
off
in
the
direction
of
the
wonder
if
shakespeare
had
that
thought
in
his
mind
i
said
he
wrote
the
a
the
old
man
sighed
so
it
is
he
said
at
it
as
you
will
life
is
indeed
a
drama
a
drama
with
but
few
no
he
added
dreamily
spend
one
half
of
it
in
regretting
the
things
we
did
in
the
other
half
the
secret
of
it
he
continued
resuming
his
cheerful
tone
not
in
the
modern
æsthetic
sense
i
presume
like
the
young
lady
in
punch
who
begins
a
conversation
with
you
no
means
replied
the
earl
i
mean
is
intensity
of
concentrated
we
lose
half
the
pleasure
we
might
have
in
life
by
not
really
take
any
instance
you
like
it
matter
trivial
the
pleasure
may
principle
is
the
same
suppose
and
are
reading
the
same
novel
never
troubles
himself
to
master
the
relationships
of
the
characters
on
which
perhaps
all
the
interest
of
the
story
depends
he
over
all
the
descriptions
of
scenery
and
every
passage
that
looks
rather
dull
he
half
attend
to
the
passages
he
does
read
he
goes
on
from
want
of
resolution
to
find
another
hours
after
he
ought
to
have
put
the
book
aside
and
reaches
the
in
a
state
of
utter
weariness
and
depression
puts
his
whole
soul
the
the
principle
that
is
worth
doing
is
worth
doing
he
masters
the
genealogies
he
calls
up
pictures
before
his
as
he
reads
about
the
scenery
best
of
all
he
resolutely
shuts
the
book
at
the
end
of
some
chapter
while
his
interest
is
yet
at
its
keenest
and
turns
to
other
subjects
so
that
when
next
he
allows
himself
an
hour
at
it
it
is
like
a
hungry
man
sitting
down
to
dinner
and
when
the
book
is
finished
he
returns
to
the
work
of
his
daily
life
like
giant
suppose
the
book
were
really
to
repay
attention
suppose
it
said
the
earl
theory
meets
case
i
assure
you
never
finds
out
that
it
rubbish
but
maunders
on
to
the
end
trying
to
believe
enjoying
himself
quietly
shuts
the
book
when
read
a
dozen
pages
walks
off
to
the
library
and
changes
it
for
a
better
i
have
yet
theory
for
adding
to
the
enjoyment
of
is
if
i
have
not
exhausted
your
patience
afraid
you
find
me
a
very
garrulous
old
indeed
i
exclaimed
earnestly
and
indeed
i
felt
as
if
one
not
easily
tire
of
the
sweet
sadness
of
that
gentle
voice
is
that
we
should
learn
to
take
our
pleasures
and
our
pains
why
i
should
have
put
it
the
other
way
taking
can
be
as
trivial
as
you
the
result
is
that
when
pain
comes
however
severe
all
you
need
do
is
to
let
it
go
at
its
pace
and
over
in
a
moment
true
i
said
how
about
the
by
taking
it
quick
you
can
get
so
much
more
into
life
it
takes
three
hours
and
a
half
to
hear
and
enjoy
an
opera
suppose
can
take
it
in
and
enjoy
it
in
why
i
can
enjoy
operas
while
you
are
listening
to
supposing
you
have
an
orchestra
capable
of
them
i
said
that
orchestra
has
yet
to
be
found
the
old
man
smiled
have
heard
an
air
played
he
said
by
no
means
a
short
right
through
variations
and
all
in
three
seconds
and
how
i
asked
eagerly
with
a
that
i
was
dreaming
again
was
done
by
a
little
he
quietly
replied
it
had
been
wound
up
the
regulator
or
something
broke
and
it
ran
down
as
i
said
in
about
three
seconds
but
it
have
played
all
the
notes
you
know
you
it
i
asked
with
all
the
severity
of
a
barrister
i
he
candidly
confessed
then
you
know
i
been
trained
to
that
kind
of
music
should
much
like
to
your
plan
i
said
and
as
sylvie
and
bruno
happened
to
run
up
to
us
at
the
moment
i
left
them
to
keep
the
earl
company
and
strolled
along
the
platform
making
each
person
and
event
play
its
part
in
an
drama
for
my
especial
benefit
is
the
earl
tired
of
you
already
i
said
as
the
children
ran
past
me
sylvie
replied
with
great
emphasis
wants
the
so
going
to
be
a
little
you
charge
a
good
price
for
it
i
called
after
them
returning
up
the
platform
i
came
upon
sylvie
alone
child
i
said
your
little
he
get
you
an
went
to
get
one
at
the
at
the
other
side
said
sylvie
coming
across
the
line
with
bruno
you
ought
to
cross
by
the
bridge
for
the
distant
thud
thud
of
the
express
was
already
audible
suddenly
a
look
of
horror
came
over
her
face
fallen
down
on
the
rails
she
cried
and
darted
past
me
at
a
speed
that
quite
defied
the
hasty
effort
i
made
to
stop
her
but
the
wheezy
old
happened
to
be
close
behind
me
he
good
for
much
poor
old
man
but
he
was
good
for
this
and
before
i
could
turn
round
he
had
the
child
clasped
in
his
arms
saved
from
the
certain
death
she
was
rushing
to
so
intent
was
i
in
watching
this
scene
that
i
hardly
saw
a
flying
figure
in
a
light
grey
suit
who
shot
across
from
the
back
of
the
platform
and
was
on
the
line
in
another
second
so
far
as
one
could
take
note
of
time
in
such
a
moment
of
horror
he
had
about
ten
clear
seconds
before
the
express
would
be
upon
him
in
which
to
cross
the
rails
and
to
pick
up
bruno
whether
he
did
so
or
not
it
was
quite
impossible
to
guess
the
next
thing
one
knew
was
that
the
express
had
passed
and
that
whether
for
life
or
death
all
was
over
when
the
cloud
of
dust
had
cleared
away
and
the
line
was
once
more
visible
we
saw
with
thankful
hearts
that
the
child
and
his
deliverer
were
safe
right
eric
called
to
us
cheerfully
as
he
recrossed
the
line
more
frightened
than
hurt
illustration
crossing
the
line
he
lifted
the
little
fellow
up
into
lady
arms
and
mounted
the
platform
as
gaily
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
he
was
as
pale
as
death
and
leaned
heavily
on
the
arm
i
hastily
offered
him
fearing
he
was
about
to
faint
down
a
he
said
dreamily
sylvie
sylvie
ran
to
him
and
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
do
that
my
darling
eric
murmured
with
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
to
cry
about
now
you
know
but
you
very
nearly
got
yourself
killed
for
nothing
bruno
the
little
maiden
sobbed
he
would
have
done
it
for
me
you
bruno
i
would
bruno
said
looking
round
with
a
bewildered
air
lady
muriel
kissed
him
in
silence
as
she
put
him
down
out
of
her
arms
then
she
beckoned
sylvie
to
come
and
take
his
hand
and
signed
to
the
children
to
go
back
to
where
the
earl
was
seated
him
she
whispered
with
quivering
lips
is
well
then
she
turned
to
the
hero
of
the
day
thought
it
was
she
said
god
you
are
safe
did
you
see
how
near
it
was
saw
there
was
just
time
eric
said
lightly
soldier
must
learn
to
carry
his
life
in
his
hand
you
know
all
right
now
shall
we
go
to
the
again
i
daresay
come
by
this
i
went
to
join
the
earl
and
the
children
and
we
in
silence
for
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
talk
and
bruno
was
on
the
others
joined
us
no
telegram
had
come
take
a
stroll
with
the
children
i
said
feeling
that
we
were
a
little
look
in
in
the
course
of
the
must
go
back
into
the
wood
now
sylvie
said
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
hearing
stay
this
size
any
you
will
be
quite
tiny
fairies
again
next
time
we
meet

sylvie

some
let
us
very
anxious
to
see
lady
muriel

nice
said
bruno
shall
be
very
glad
to
take
you
to
see
her
again
i
said
i
better
give
you
back
the
watch
be
too
large
for
you
to
carry
when
fairies
you
bruno
laughed
merrily
i
was
glad
to
see
he
had
quite
recovered
from
the
terrible
scene
he
had
gone
through
no
it
he
said
go
small
go
small
then
go
straight
to
the
professor
sylvie
added
you
be
able
to
use
it
any
more
so
better
use
it
all
you
can
we
go
small
when
the
sun
sets
cried
bruno
but
their
voices
sounded
very
far
away
and
when
i
looked
round
both
children
had
disappeared
it
wants
only
two
hours
to
sunset
i
said
as
i
strolled
on
must
make
the
best
of
my
time
chapter
xxiii
an
outlandish
watch
as
i
entered
the
little
town
i
came
upon
two
of
the
wives
interchanging
that
last
word
never
was
the
and
it
occurred
to
me
as
an
experiment
with
the
magic
watch
to
wait
till
the
little
scene
was
over
and
then
to
it
good
night
and
ye
winna
forget
to
send
us
word
when
your
martha
writes
ah
winna
forget
if
she
suited
she
can
but
coom
back
good
night
a
casual
observer
might
have
thought
there
ends
the
dialogue
that
casual
observer
would
have
been
mistaken
like
i
ye
not
treat
her
bad
yer
may
depend
varry
canny
fowk
good
night
they
that
good
night
night
and
send
us
word
if
she
writes
ah
will
yer
may
depend
good
night
and
at
last
they
parted
i
waited
till
they
were
some
twenty
yards
apart
and
then
put
the
watch
a
minute
back
the
instantaneous
change
was
startling
the
two
figures
seemed
to
flash
back
into
their
former
places
suited
she
can
but
coom
back
good
night
one
of
them
was
saying
and
so
the
whole
dialogue
was
repeated
and
when
they
had
parted
for
the
second
time
i
let
them
go
their
several
ways
and
strolled
on
through
the
town
the
real
usefulness
of
this
magic
power
i
thought
be
to
undo
some
harm
some
painful
event
some
i
had
not
long
to
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
testing
property
also
of
the
magic
watch
for
even
as
the
thought
passed
through
my
mind
the
accident
i
was
imagining
occurred
a
light
cart
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
millinery
of
elveston
laden
with
which
the
driver
was
carrying
into
the
shop
one
by
one
one
of
the
cases
had
fallen
into
the
street
but
it
scarcely
seemed
worth
while
to
step
forward
and
pick
it
up
as
the
man
would
be
back
again
in
a
moment
yet
in
that
moment
a
young
man
riding
a
bicycle
came
sharp
round
the
corner
of
the
street
and
in
trying
to
avoid
running
over
the
box
upset
his
machine
and
was
thrown
headlong
against
the
wheel
of
the
the
driver
ran
out
to
his
assistance
and
he
and
i
together
raised
the
unfortunate
cyclist
and
carried
him
into
the
shop
his
head
was
cut
and
bleeding
and
one
knee
seemed
to
be
badly
injured
and
it
was
speedily
settled
that
he
had
better
be
conveyed
at
once
to
the
only
surgery
in
the
place
i
helped
them
in
emptying
the
cart
and
placing
in
it
some
pillows
for
the
wounded
man
to
rest
on
and
it
was
only
when
the
driver
had
mounted
to
his
place
and
was
starting
for
the
surgery
that
i
bethought
me
of
the
strange
power
i
possessed
of
undoing
all
this
harm
is
my
time
i
said
to
myself
as
i
moved
back
the
hand
of
the
watch
and
saw
almost
without
surprise
this
time
all
things
restored
to
the
places
they
had
occupied
at
the
critical
moment
when
i
had
first
noticed
the
fallen
instantly
i
stepped
out
into
the
street
picked
up
the
box
and
replaced
it
in
the
cart
in
the
next
moment
the
bicycle
had
spun
round
the
corner
passed
the
cart
without
let
or
hindrance
and
soon
vanished
in
the
distance
in
a
cloud
of
dust
power
of
magic
i
thought
much
of
human
suffering
i
only
relieved
but
actually
annihilated
and
in
a
glow
of
conscious
virtue
i
stood
watching
the
unloading
of
the
cart
still
holding
the
magic
watch
open
in
my
hand
as
i
was
curious
to
see
what
would
happen
when
we
again
reached
the
exact
time
at
which
i
had
put
back
the
hand
the
result
was
one
that
if
only
i
had
considered
the
thing
carefully
i
might
have
foreseen
as
the
hand
of
the
watch
touched
the
mark
the
had
driven
off
and
was
by
this
time
down
the
street
was
back
again
at
the
door
and
in
the
act
of
starting
woe
for
the
golden
dream
of
benevolence
that
had
dazzled
my
dreaming
fancy
wounded
youth
was
once
more
reclining
on
the
heap
of
pillows
his
pale
face
set
rigidly
in
the
hard
lines
that
told
of
pain
resolutely
endured
mocking
magic
watch
i
said
to
myself
as
i
passed
out
of
the
little
town
and
took
the
seaward
road
that
led
to
my
lodgings
good
i
fancied
i
could
do
is
vanished
like
a
dream
the
evil
of
this
troublesome
world
is
the
only
abiding
reality
and
now
i
must
record
an
experience
so
strange
that
i
think
it
only
fair
before
beginning
to
relate
it
to
release
my
reader
from
any
obligation
he
may
feel
to
believe
this
part
of
my
story
would
not
have
believed
it
i
freely
confess
if
i
had
not
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
then
why
should
i
expect
it
of
my
reader
who
quite
possibly
has
never
seen
anything
of
the
sort
i
was
passing
a
pretty
little
villa
which
stood
rather
back
from
the
road
in
its
own
grounds
with
bright
in
wandering
over
the
walls
and
hanging
in
festoons
about
the
forgotten
on
the
lawn
with
a
newspaper
lying
near
small
before
it
resolved
to
guard
the
treasure
even
at
the
sacrifice
of
a
standing
invitingly
is
my
chance
i
thought
testing
the
reverse
action
of
the
magic
watch
i
pressed
the
and
walked
in
in
house
the
entrance
of
a
stranger
might
cause
anger
even
going
so
far
as
to
expel
the
said
stranger
with
violence
but
i
knew
nothing
of
the
sort
could
happen
the
course
of
to
think
nothing
about
me
then
hearing
my
footsteps
to
look
up
and
see
me
and
then
to
wonder
what
business
i
had
be
reversed
by
the
action
of
my
watch
they
would
wonder
who
i
was
see
me
then
look
down
and
think
no
more
about
me
and
as
to
being
expelled
with
violence
event
would
necessarily
come
in
this
case
if
i
can
once
get
i
said
to
myself
risk
of
will
be
over
illustration
sat
the
sat
up
as
a
precautionary
measure
as
i
passed
but
as
i
took
no
notice
of
the
treasure
he
was
guarding
he
let
me
go
by
without
even
one
remonstrant
bark
that
takes
my
life
he
seemed
to
be
saying
wheezily
to
himself
trash
but
he
that
takes
the
but
this
awful
contingency
i
did
not
face
the
party
in
the
had
walked
straight
in
you
understand
without
ringing
the
bell
or
giving
any
notice
of
my
of
four
laughing
rosy
children
of
ages
from
about
fourteen
down
to
ten
who
were
apparently
all
coming
towards
the
door
i
found
they
were
really
walking
while
their
mother
seated
by
the
fire
with
some
needlework
on
her
lap
was
saying
just
as
i
entered
the
room
girls
you
may
get
your
things
on
for
a
to
my
utter
i
was
not
yet
accustomed
to
the
action
of
the
smiles
as
browning
says
on
the
four
pretty
faces
and
they
all
got
out
pieces
of
and
sat
down
no
one
noticed
in
the
least
as
i
quietly
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
to
watch
them
when
the
had
been
unfolded
and
they
were
all
ready
to
begin
their
mother
said
done
at
last
you
may
fold
up
your
work
but
the
children
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
remark
on
the
contrary
they
set
to
work
at
once
that
is
the
proper
word
to
describe
an
operation
such
as
had
never
before
witnessed
each
of
them
threaded
her
needle
with
a
short
end
of
thread
attached
to
the
work
which
was
instantly
pulled
by
an
invisible
force
through
the
stuff
dragging
the
needle
after
it
the
nimble
fingers
of
the
little
sempstress
caught
it
at
the
other
side
but
only
to
lose
it
again
the
next
moment
and
so
the
work
went
on
steadily
undoing
itself
and
the
little
dresses
or
whatever
they
were
steadily
falling
to
pieces
now
and
then
one
of
the
children
would
pause
as
the
recovered
thread
became
inconveniently
long
wind
it
on
a
bobbin
and
start
again
with
another
short
end
at
last
all
the
work
was
picked
to
pieces
and
put
away
and
the
lady
led
the
way
into
the
next
room
walking
backwards
and
making
the
insane
remark
yet
dear
we
get
the
sewing
done
after
which
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
children
skipping
backwards
after
her
exclaiming
mother
it
such
a
lovely
day
for
a
walk
in
the
the
table
had
only
dirty
plates
and
empty
dishes
on
it
however
the
the
addition
of
a
gentleman
as
and
as
rosy
as
the
themselves
at
it
very
contentedly
you
have
seen
people
eating
and
every
now
and
then
cautiously
conveying
a
from
their
lips
to
their
plates
well
something
like
that
went
on
all
through
this
shall
we
say
an
empty
fork
is
raised
to
the
lips
there
it
receives
a
piece
of
mutton
and
swiftly
conveys
it
to
the
plate
where
it
instantly
attaches
itself
to
the
mutton
already
there
soon
one
of
the
plates
furnished
with
a
complete
slice
of
mutton
and
two
potatoes
was
handed
up
to
the
presiding
gentleman
who
quietly
replaced
the
slice
on
the
joint
and
the
potatoes
in
the
dish
their
conversation
was
if
possible
more
bewildering
than
their
mode
of
dining
it
began
by
the
youngest
girl
suddenly
and
without
provocation
addressing
her
eldest
sister
you
she
said
i
expected
a
sharp
reply
from
the
sister
but
instead
of
this
she
turned
laughingly
to
her
father
and
said
in
a
very
loud
be
a
bride
the
father
in
order
to
do
part
in
a
conversation
that
seemed
only
fit
for
lunatics
replied
it
to
me
but
she
whisper
these
children
never
did
anything
they
were
told
she
said
quite
loud
course
not
everybody
knows
what
wants
and
little
dolly
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
with
a
pretty
pettishness
father
not
to
tease
you
know
i
want
to
be
to
to
be
the
fourth
was
her
idiotic
reply
here
number
three
put
in
her
oar
it
settled
mother
dear
really
and
truly
mary
told
us
all
about
it
to
be
next
tuesday
four
three
of
her
cousins
are
coming
to
be
forget
it
minnie
the
mother
laughingly
replied
do
wish
get
it
settled
i
like
long
and
minnie
wound
up
the
so
chaotic
a
series
of
remarks
deserves
the
think
we
passed
the
cedars
this
morning
just
exactly
as
mary
davenant
was
standing
at
the
gate
wishing
to
forget
his
name
of
course
we
looked
the
other
by
this
time
i
was
so
hopelessly
confused
that
i
gave
up
listening
and
followed
the
dinner
down
into
the
kitchen
but
to
you
o
hypercritical
reader
resolute
to
believe
no
item
of
this
weird
adventure
what
need
to
tell
how
the
mutton
was
placed
on
the
spit
and
slowly
the
potatoes
were
wrapped
in
their
skins
and
handed
over
to
the
gardener
to
be
when
the
mutton
had
at
length
attained
to
rawness
the
fire
which
had
gradually
changed
from
to
a
mere
blaze
died
down
so
suddenly
that
the
cook
had
only
just
time
to
catch
its
last
flicker
on
the
end
of
a
how
the
maid
having
taken
the
mutton
off
the
spit
carried
it
backwards
of
course
out
of
the
house
to
meet
the
butcher
who
was
coming
also
backwards
down
the
road
the
longer
i
thought
over
this
strange
adventure
the
more
hopelessly
tangled
the
mystery
became
and
it
was
a
real
relief
to
meet
arthur
in
the
road
and
get
him
to
go
with
me
up
to
the
hall
to
learn
what
news
the
telegraph
had
brought
i
told
him
as
we
went
what
had
happened
at
the
station
but
as
to
my
further
adventures
i
thought
it
best
for
the
present
to
say
nothing
the
earl
was
sitting
alone
when
we
entered
am
glad
you
are
come
in
to
keep
me
company
he
said
is
gone
to
excitement
of
that
terrible
scene
was
too
much
for
eric
has
gone
to
the
hotel
to
pack
his
things
to
start
for
london
by
the
early
the
telegram
has
come
i
said
you
not
hear
oh
i
had
forgotten
it
came
in
after
you
left
the
station
yes
all
right
eric
has
got
his
commission
and
now
that
he
has
arranged
matters
with
muriel
he
has
business
in
town
that
must
be
seen
to
at
arrangement
do
you
mean
i
asked
with
a
sinking
heart
as
the
thought
of
crushed
hopes
came
to
my
mind
you
mean
that
they
are
have
been
a
two
years
the
old
man
gently
replied
is
he
has
had
my
promise
to
consent
to
it
so
soon
as
he
could
secure
a
permanent
and
settled
line
in
life
i
could
never
be
happy
with
my
child
married
to
a
man
without
an
object
to
live
even
an
object
to
die
for
hope
they
will
be
happy
a
strange
voice
said
the
speaker
was
evidently
in
the
room
but
i
had
not
heard
the
door
open
and
i
looked
round
in
some
astonishment
the
earl
seemed
to
share
my
surprise
spoke
he
exclaimed
was
i
said
arthur
looking
at
us
with
a
worn
haggard
face
and
eyes
from
which
the
light
of
life
seemed
suddenly
to
have
faded
let
me
wish
joy
also
dear
friend
he
added
looking
sadly
at
the
earl
and
speaking
in
the
same
hollow
tones
that
had
startled
us
so
much
you
the
old
man
said
simply
and
heartily
a
silence
followed
then
i
rose
feeling
sure
that
arthur
would
wish
to
be
alone
and
bade
our
gentle
host
arthur
took
his
hand
but
said
nothing
nor
did
he
speak
again
as
we
went
home
till
we
were
in
the
house
and
had
lit
our
candles
then
he
said
more
to
himself
than
to
me
heart
knoweth
its
own
i
never
understood
those
words
till
the
next
few
days
passed
wearily
enough
i
felt
no
inclination
to
call
again
by
myself
at
the
hall
still
less
to
propose
that
arthur
should
go
with
me
it
seemed
better
to
wait
till
gentle
healer
of
our
bitterest
have
helped
him
to
recover
from
the
first
shock
of
the
disappointment
that
had
blighted
his
life
business
however
soon
demanded
my
presence
in
town
and
i
had
to
announce
to
arthur
that
i
must
leave
him
for
a
while
i
hope
to
run
down
again
in
a
month
i
added
would
stay
now
if
i
could
i
think
good
for
you
to
be
i
face
solitude
for
long
said
arthur
think
about
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
accept
a
post
in
india
that
has
been
offered
me
out
there
i
suppose
i
shall
find
something
to
live
for
i
see
at
present
life
of
mine
i
guard
as
high
gift
from
scathe
and
wrong
not
greatly
care
to
lose
i
said
bore
as
heavy
a
blow
and
lived
through
far
heavier
one
than
said
arthur
woman
loved
proved
false
there
is
no
such
cloud
as
on
my
memory
he
left
the
name
unuttered
and
went
on
hurriedly
will
return
will
you
not
i
shall
come
back
for
a
short
said
arthur
you
shall
write
and
tell
me
of
our
friends
send
you
my
address
when
settled
chapter
xxiv
the
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
just
a
week
after
the
day
when
my
first
appeared
as
children
i
found
myself
taking
a
through
the
wood
in
the
hope
of
meeting
them
once
more
i
had
but
to
stretch
myself
on
the
smooth
turf
and
the
feeling
was
on
me
in
a
moment
oor
ear
low
down
said
bruno
tell
oo
a
secret
the
lost
the
baby
baby
i
said
quite
bewildered
by
this
complicated
piece
of
news
baby
a
course
said
bruno
baby
and
sorry
sylvie
so
sorry
sorry
is
she
i
asked
mischievously
of
a
yard
bruno
replied
with
perfect
solemnity
a
little
sorry
too
he
added
shutting
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
that
he
was
smiling
what
are
you
doing
about
the
baby
the
are
all
looking
for
and
i
exclaimed
a
course
said
bruno
no
fighting
to
be
done
the
soldiers
doos
any
little
odd
jobs
oo
i
was
amused
at
the
idea
of
its
being
a
odd
to
find
the
royal
baby
how
did
you
come
to
lose
it
i
asked
put
it
in
a
flower
sylvie
who
had
just
joined
us
explained
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
we
remember
says
put
it
in
a
flower
bruno
interrupted
she
want
to
get
punished
but
it
were
really
what
put
it
there
were
picking
illustration
the
baby
say
put
it
in
a
sylvie
very
gravely
remarked
then
said
bruno
never
remember
those
horrid
me
help
you
to
look
for
it
i
said
so
sylvie
and
i
made
a
of
among
all
the
flowers
but
there
was
no
baby
to
be
seen
become
of
bruno
i
said
when
we
had
completed
our
tour
down
in
the
ditch
there
said
sylvie
a
young
i
went
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
to
look
for
him
for
i
felt
very
curious
to
know
how
young
frogs
to
be
amused
after
a
search
i
found
him
sitting
at
the
edge
of
the
ditch
by
the
side
of
the
little
frog
and
looking
rather
disconsolate
are
you
getting
on
bruno
i
said
nodding
to
him
as
he
looked
up
amuse
it
no
more
bruno
answered
very
dolefully
it
say
what
it
would
like
to
do
next
showed
it
all
the
a
live
it
say
nuffin
he
shouted
into
the
ear
of
the
frog
but
the
little
creature
sat
quite
still
and
took
no
notice
of
him
deaf
i
think
bruno
said
turning
away
with
a
sigh
time
to
get
the
theatre
are
the
audience
to
be
but
frogs
said
bruno
they
comed
yet
they
wants
to
be
drove
up
like
it
save
time
i
suggested
were
to
walk
round
with
sylvie
to
drive
up
the
frogs
while
get
the
theatre
ready
a
good
plan
cried
bruno
where
sylvie
here
said
sylvie
peeping
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
was
just
watching
two
frogs
that
were
having
a
won
it
bruno
eagerly
inquired
sylvie
was
puzzled
ask
such
hard
questions
she
confided
to
me
to
happen
in
the
theatre
i
asked
they
have
their
sylvie
said
bruno
does
some
bits
of
shakespeare
then
he
tells
them
a
should
think
the
frogs
like
the
feast
best
they
generally
very
few
of
them
that
get
any
they
keep
their
mouths
shut
so
tight
and
just
as
well
they
she
added
bruno
likes
to
cook
it
himself
and
he
cooks
queerly
now
all
in
would
you
just
help
me
to
put
them
with
their
heads
the
right
way
we
soon
managed
this
part
of
the
business
though
the
frogs
kept
up
a
most
discontented
croaking
all
the
time
they
saying
i
asked
sylvie
saying
fork
very
silly
of
them
not
going
to
forks
she
announced
with
some
severity
that
want
any
feast
have
just
got
to
open
their
mouths
and
put
some
of
it
in
at
this
moment
bruno
appeared
wearing
a
little
white
apron
to
show
that
he
was
a
cook
and
carrying
a
tureen
full
of
very
soup
i
watched
very
carefully
as
he
moved
about
among
the
frogs
but
i
could
not
see
that
of
them
opened
their
mouths
to
be
one
very
young
one
and
nearly
sure
it
did
it
accidentally
in
yawning
however
bruno
instantly
put
a
large
spoonful
of
soup
into
its
mouth
and
the
poor
little
thing
coughed
violently
for
some
time
so
sylvie
and
i
had
to
share
the
soup
between
us
and
to
to
enjoy
it
for
it
certainly
was
queerly
cooked
i
only
ventured
to
take
spoonful
of
it
bruno
said
it
was
and
must
candidly
confess
that
it
was
not
nice
and
i
could
not
feel
surprised
that
so
many
of
the
guests
had
kept
their
mouths
shut
up
tight
the
soup
of
bruno
said
sylvie
who
had
put
a
spoonful
of
it
to
her
lips
and
was
making
a
wry
face
over
it
and
answer
was
anything
but
encouraging
of
things
the
entertainment
was
to
conclude
with
of
shakespeare
as
sylvie
expressed
it
which
were
all
to
be
done
by
bruno
sylvie
being
fully
engaged
in
making
the
frogs
keep
their
heads
towards
the
stage
after
which
bruno
was
to
appear
in
his
real
character
and
tell
them
a
story
of
his
own
invention
the
story
have
a
moral
to
it
i
asked
sylvie
while
bruno
was
away
behind
the
hedge
dressing
for
the
first
so
sylvie
replied
doubtfully
generally
a
moral
only
he
puts
it
in
too
will
he
all
the
bits
of
shakespeare
only
them
said
sylvie
knows
hardly
any
of
the
words
when
i
see
what
dressed
like
to
tell
the
frogs
what
character
it
is
always
in
such
a
hurry
to
guess
you
hear
them
all
saying
what
and
so
indeed
they
were
it
had
only
sounded
like
croaking
till
sylvie
explained
it
but
i
could
now
make
out
the
wawt
quite
distinctly
why
do
they
try
to
guess
it
before
they
see
it
know
sylvie
said
they
always
sometimes
they
begin
guessing
weeks
and
weeks
before
the
day
so
now
when
you
hear
the
frogs
croaking
in
a
particularly
melancholy
way
you
may
be
sure
trying
to
guess
next
shakespeare
interesting
however
the
chorus
of
guessing
was
cut
short
by
bruno
who
suddenly
rushed
on
from
behind
the
scenes
and
took
a
flying
leap
down
among
the
frogs
to
them
for
the
oldest
and
fattest
had
never
been
properly
arranged
so
that
he
could
see
the
stage
and
so
had
no
idea
what
was
going
getting
restless
and
had
upset
several
of
the
frogs
and
turned
others
round
with
their
heads
the
wrong
way
and
it
was
no
good
at
all
bruno
said
to
do
a
of
shakespeare
when
there
was
nobody
to
look
at
it
you
see
he
count
as
anybody
so
he
set
to
work
with
a
stick
stirring
them
up
very
much
as
you
would
stir
up
tea
in
a
cup
till
most
of
them
had
at
least
great
stupid
eye
gazing
at
the
stage
must
come
and
sit
among
them
sylvie
he
said
in
despair
put
these
two
with
their
noses
the
same
way
ever
so
many
times
but
they
squarrel
so
so
sylvie
took
her
place
as
of
the
ceremonies
and
bruno
vanished
again
behind
the
scenes
to
dress
for
the
first
was
suddenly
proclaimed
in
the
clear
sweet
tones
i
knew
so
well
the
croaking
all
ceased
in
a
moment
and
i
turned
to
the
stage
in
some
curiosity
to
see
what
ideas
were
as
to
the
behaviour
of
greatest
character
according
to
this
eminent
interpreter
of
the
drama
hamlet
wore
a
short
black
cloak
which
he
chiefly
used
for
muffling
up
his
face
as
if
he
suffered
a
good
deal
from
toothache
and
turned
out
his
toes
very
much
as
he
walked
be
or
not
to
be
hamlet
remarked
in
a
cheerful
tone
and
then
turned
several
times
his
cloak
dropping
off
in
the
performance
i
felt
a
little
disappointed
conception
of
the
part
seemed
so
wanting
in
dignity
he
say
any
more
of
the
speech
i
whispered
to
sylvie
not
sylvie
whispered
in
reply
generally
turns
when
he
know
any
more
bruno
had
meanwhile
settled
the
question
by
disappearing
from
the
stage
and
the
frogs
instantly
began
inquiring
the
name
of
the
next
character
know
directly
cried
sylvie
as
she
adjusted
two
or
three
young
frogs
that
had
struggled
round
with
their
backs
to
the
stage
she
added
as
bruno
macbeth
had
something
twisted
round
him
that
went
over
one
shoulder
and
under
the
other
arm
and
was
meant
i
believe
for
a
scotch
plaid
he
had
a
thorn
in
his
hand
which
he
held
out
at
length
as
if
he
were
a
little
afraid
of
it
this
a
macbeth
inquired
in
a
puzzled
sort
of
tone
and
instantly
a
chorus
of
thorn
arose
from
the
frogs
i
had
quite
learned
to
understand
their
croaking
by
this
time
a
sylvie
proclaimed
in
a
peremptory
tone
your
tongues
and
the
croaking
ceased
at
once
shakespeare
has
not
told
us
so
far
as
i
know
that
macbeth
had
any
such
eccentric
habit
as
turning
in
private
life
but
bruno
evidently
considered
it
quite
an
essential
part
of
the
character
and
left
the
stage
in
a
series
of
somersaults
however
he
was
back
again
in
a
few
moments
having
tucked
under
his
chin
the
end
of
a
tuft
of
wool
probably
left
on
the
thorn
by
a
wandering
sheep
which
made
a
magnificent
beard
that
reached
nearly
down
to
his
feet
sylvie
proclaimed
i
beg
your
pardon
she
hastily
corrected
herself
lear
i
noticed
the
bruno
had
very
cleverly
provided
one
which
fitted
him
exactly
by
cutting
out
the
centre
of
a
dandelion
to
make
room
for
his
head
king
lear
folded
his
arms
to
the
imminent
peril
of
his
beard
and
said
in
a
mild
explanatory
tone
every
a
king
and
then
paused
as
if
to
consider
how
this
could
best
be
proved
and
here
with
all
possible
deference
to
bruno
as
a
shakespearian
critic
i
express
my
opinion
that
the
poet
did
mean
his
three
great
tragic
heroes
to
be
so
strangely
alike
in
their
personal
habits
nor
do
i
believe
that
he
would
have
accepted
the
faculty
of
turning
as
any
proof
at
all
of
royal
descent
yet
it
appeared
that
king
lear
after
deep
meditation
could
think
of
no
other
argument
by
which
to
prove
his
kingship
and
as
this
was
the
last
of
the
of
shakespeare
never
do
more
than
sylvie
explained
in
a
whisper
bruno
gave
the
audience
quite
a
long
series
of
somersaults
before
he
finally
retired
leaving
the
enraptured
frogs
all
crying
out
more
which
i
suppose
was
their
way
of
encoring
a
performance
but
bruno
appear
again
till
the
proper
time
came
for
telling
the
story
illustration
the
when
he
appeared
at
last
in
his
character
i
noticed
a
remarkable
change
in
his
behaviour
he
tried
no
more
somersaults
it
was
clearly
his
opinion
that
however
suitable
the
habit
of
turning
might
be
to
such
petty
individuals
as
hamlet
and
king
lear
it
would
never
do
for
to
sacrifice
his
dignity
to
such
an
extent
but
it
was
equally
clear
that
he
did
not
feel
entirely
at
his
ease
standing
all
alone
on
the
stage
with
no
costume
to
disguise
him
and
though
he
began
several
times
were
a
he
kept
glancing
up
and
down
and
on
all
sides
as
if
in
search
of
more
comfortable
quarters
from
which
to
tell
the
story
standing
on
one
side
of
the
stage
and
partly
overshadowing
it
was
a
tall
which
seemed
as
the
evening
breeze
gently
swayed
it
hither
and
thither
to
offer
exactly
the
sort
of
accommodation
that
the
orator
desired
having
once
decided
on
his
quarters
it
needed
only
a
second
or
two
for
him
to
run
up
the
stem
like
a
tiny
squirrel
and
to
seat
himself
astride
on
the
topmost
bend
where
the
clustered
most
closely
and
from
whence
he
could
look
down
on
his
audience
from
such
a
height
that
all
shyness
vanished
and
he
began
his
story
merrily
there
were
a
mouse
and
a
crocodile
and
a
man
and
a
goat
and
a
i
had
never
heard
the
tumbled
into
a
story
with
such
profusion
and
in
such
reckless
haste
and
it
fairly
took
my
breath
away
even
sylvie
gave
a
little
gasp
and
allowed
three
of
the
frogs
who
seemed
to
be
getting
tired
of
the
entertainment
to
hop
away
into
the
ditch
without
attempting
to
stop
them
the
mouse
found
a
shoe
and
it
thought
it
were
a
so
it
got
right
in
and
it
stayed
in
ever
so
did
it
in
said
sylvie
her
function
seemed
to
be
much
the
same
as
that
of
the
chorus
in
a
greek
play
she
had
to
encourage
the
orator
and
draw
him
out
by
a
series
of
intelligent
questions
it
thought
it
get
out
again
bruno
explained
were
a
clever
mouse
it
knew
it
get
out
of
traps
why
did
it
go
in
at
all
said
sylvie
it
jamp
and
it
jamp
bruno
proceeded
ignoring
this
question
at
last
it
got
right
out
again
and
it
looked
at
the
mark
in
the
shoe
and
the
name
were
in
it
so
it
knew
it
its
own
it
thought
it
said
sylvie
i
tell
oo
it
thought
it
were
a
the
indignant
orator
replied
mister
sir
will
oo
make
sylvie
attend
sylvie
was
silenced
and
was
all
attention
in
fact
she
and
i
were
most
of
the
audience
now
as
the
frogs
kept
hopping
away
and
there
were
very
few
of
them
left
the
mouse
gave
the
man
his
shoe
and
the
man
were
welly
glad
he
got
but
one
shoe
and
he
were
hopping
to
get
the
here
i
ventured
on
a
question
you
mean
or
said
bruno
the
man
took
the
goat
out
of
the
heard
of
the
before
i
said
you
hear
of
it
again
said
bruno
he
said
to
the
goat
will
walk
about
here
till
i
comes
and
he
went
and
he
tumbled
into
a
deep
hole
and
the
goat
walked
round
and
round
and
it
walked
under
the
tree
and
it
wug
its
tail
and
it
looked
up
in
the
tree
and
it
sang
a
sad
little
song
oo
never
heard
such
a
sad
little
song
you
sing
it
bruno
i
asked
i
can
bruno
readily
replied
i
it
would
make
sylvie
sylvie
interrupted
in
great
indignation
i
believe
the
goat
sang
it
at
all
did
though
said
bruno
singed
it
right
froo
i
it
singing
with
its
long
sing
with
its
i
said
hoping
to
puzzle
the
little
fellow
beard
a
then
walk
with
sylvie
bruno
cried
triumphantly
a
i
thought
i
had
better
follow
example
and
be
silent
for
a
while
bruno
was
too
sharp
for
us
when
it
had
singed
all
the
song
it
ran
to
get
along
to
look
for
the
man
oo
know
and
the
crocodile
got
along
after
to
bite
it
oo
know
and
the
mouse
got
along
after
the
the
crocodile
sylvie
enquired
she
appealed
to
me
do
run
they
i
suggested
as
the
proper
word
running
said
bruno
he
crawling
he
went
struggling
along
like
a
portmanteau
and
he
held
his
chin
ever
so
high
in
the
did
he
do
for
said
sylvie
he
got
a
toofache
said
bruno
oo
make
out
wizout
i
it
why
if
had
a
toofache
a
course
have
held
his
head
have
put
a
lot
of
warm
blankets
round
it
any
blankets
sylvie
argued
he
blankets
retorted
her
brother
oo
think
crocodiles
goes
walks
wizout
blankets
and
he
frowned
with
his
eyebrows
and
the
goat
was
welly
flightened
at
his
eyebrows
never
be
afraid
of
exclaimed
sylvie
should
think
oo
though
if
got
a
crocodile
fastened
to
them
like
these
had
and
so
the
man
jamp
and
he
jamp
and
at
last
he
got
right
out
of
the
sylvie
gave
another
little
gasp
this
rapid
dodging
about
among
the
characters
of
the
story
had
taken
away
her
breath
he
runned
to
look
for
the
goat
oo
know
and
he
heard
the
lion
grunt
said
sylvie
one
did
said
bruno
its
mouth
were
like
a
large
cupboard
and
it
had
plenty
of
room
in
its
mouth
and
the
lion
runned
after
the
to
eat
him
oo
know
and
the
mouse
runned
after
the
the
mouse
was
running
after
the
i
said
run
after
bruno
sighed
over
the
density
of
his
audience
but
explained
very
patiently
runned
after
they
went
the
same
way
and
first
he
caught
the
crocodile
and
then
he
catch
the
lion
and
when
caught
the
crocodile
what
doos
oo
think
he
got
pincers
in
his
pocket
guess
said
sylvie
illustration
wrenched
out
that
toof
guess
it
bruno
cried
in
high
glee
he
wrenched
out
that
toof
tooth
i
ventured
to
ask
but
bruno
was
not
to
be
puzzled
toof
he
were
going
to
bite
the
goat
with
a
course
be
sure
about
that
i
argued
he
wrenched
out
its
bruno
laughed
merrily
and
half
sang
as
he
swung
himself
backwards
and
forwards
its
teef
did
the
crocodile
wait
to
have
them
wrenched
out
said
sylvie
had
to
wait
said
bruno
i
ventured
on
another
question
what
became
of
the
man
who
said
may
wait
here
till
i
come
say
bruno
explained
said
just
like
sylvie
says
to
me
will
do
oor
lessons
till
twelve
oh
i
he
added
with
a
little
sigh
sylvie
would
say
do
oor
this
was
a
dangerous
subject
for
discussion
sylvie
seemed
to
think
she
returned
to
the
story
what
became
of
the
man
the
lion
springed
at
him
but
it
came
so
slow
it
were
three
weeks
in
the
the
man
wait
for
it
all
that
time
i
said
he
bruno
replied
gliding
down
the
stem
of
the
for
the
story
was
evidently
close
to
its
end
sold
his
house
and
he
packed
up
his
things
while
the
lion
were
coming
and
he
went
and
he
lived
in
another
town
so
the
lion
ate
the
wrong
this
was
evidently
the
moral
so
sylvie
made
her
final
proclamation
to
the
frogs
finished
and
whatever
is
to
be
from
it
she
added
aside
to
me
sure
know
i
did
not
feel
clear
about
it
myself
so
made
no
suggestion
but
the
frogs
seemed
quite
content
moral
or
no
moral
and
merely
raised
a
husky
chorus
of
off
as
they
hopped
away
chapter
xxv
looking
eastward
just
a
week
i
said
three
days
later
to
arthur
we
heard
of
lady
engagement
i
think
ought
to
call
at
any
rate
and
offer
my
congratulations
you
come
with
me
a
pained
expression
passed
over
his
face
must
you
leave
us
he
asked
the
first
train
on
i
come
with
you
it
would
seem
strange
and
unfriendly
if
i
but
this
is
only
friday
give
me
till
sunday
afternoon
i
shall
be
stronger
shading
his
eyes
with
one
hand
as
if
of
the
tears
that
were
coursing
down
his
cheeks
he
held
the
other
out
to
me
it
trembled
as
i
clasped
it
i
tried
to
frame
some
words
of
sympathy
but
they
seemed
poor
and
cold
and
i
left
them
unspoken
night
was
all
i
said
night
dear
friend
he
replied
there
was
a
manly
vigour
in
his
tone
that
convinced
me
he
was
wrestling
with
and
triumphing
over
the
great
sorrow
that
had
so
nearly
wrecked
his
that
on
the
of
his
dead
self
he
would
surely
rise
to
higher
things
there
was
no
chance
i
was
glad
to
think
as
we
set
out
on
sunday
afternoon
of
meeting
at
the
hall
as
he
had
returned
to
town
the
day
after
his
engagement
was
announced
presence
might
have
disturbed
the
almost
unnatural
which
arthur
met
the
woman
who
had
won
his
heart
and
murmured
the
few
graceful
words
of
sympathy
that
the
occasion
demanded
lady
muriel
was
perfectly
radiant
with
happiness
sadness
could
not
live
in
the
light
of
such
a
smile
and
even
arthur
brightened
under
it
and
when
she
remarked
see
watering
my
flowers
though
it
the
his
voice
had
almost
its
old
ring
of
cheerfulness
as
he
replied
on
the
works
of
mercy
are
allowed
but
this
the
the
has
ceased
to
know
not
lady
muriel
replied
sunday
often
called
christian
is
so
called
i
think
in
recognition
of
the
of
the
jewish
institution
that
one
day
in
seven
should
be
a
day
of
but
i
hold
that
christians
are
freed
from
the
observance
of
the
fourth
where
is
our
for
sunday
observance
have
first
the
fact
that
the
seventh
day
was
when
god
rested
from
the
work
of
creation
that
is
binding
on
us
as
secondly
we
have
the
fact
that
is
a
institution
that
is
binding
on
us
as
your
practical
rules
would
as
theists
to
keep
it
in
some
special
way
and
to
make
it
so
far
as
is
reasonably
possible
a
day
of
secondly
as
to
attend
public
what
of
would
say
of
them
as
of
all
kinds
of
whatever
is
innocent
on
a
is
innocent
on
sunday
provided
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
duties
of
the
you
would
allow
children
to
on
sunday
i
should
why
make
the
day
irksome
to
their
restless
natures
have
a
letter
somewhere
said
lady
muriel
an
old
friend
describing
the
way
in
which
sunday
was
kept
in
her
younger
days
i
will
fetch
it
for
had
a
similar
description
years
ago
arthur
said
when
she
had
left
us
a
little
girl
it
was
really
touching
to
hear
the
melancholy
tone
in
which
she
said
sunday
i
play
with
my
doll
on
sunday
i
run
on
the
sands
on
sunday
i
dig
in
the
garden
poor
child
she
had
indeed
abundant
cause
for
hating
sunday
is
the
letter
said
lady
muriel
returning
me
read
you
a
piece
of
as
a
child
i
first
opened
my
eyes
on
a
a
feeling
of
dismal
anticipation
which
began
at
least
on
the
friday
culminated
i
knew
what
was
before
me
and
my
wish
if
not
my
word
was
god
it
were
evening
it
was
no
day
of
rest
but
a
day
of
texts
of
catechisms
of
tracts
about
converted
swearers
godly
and
edifying
deaths
of
sinners
with
the
lark
hymns
and
portions
of
scripture
had
to
be
learned
by
heart
till
when
there
were
then
breakfast
which
i
was
never
able
to
enjoy
partly
from
the
fast
already
undergone
and
partly
from
the
outlook
i
came
and
it
made
me
indignant
to
be
put
into
the
class
with
the
as
well
as
alarmed
lest
by
some
mistake
of
mine
i
should
be
put
below
was
a
veritable
wilderness
of
zin
i
wandered
in
it
pitching
the
tabernacle
of
my
thoughts
on
the
lining
of
the
square
the
fidgets
of
my
small
brothers
and
the
horror
of
knowing
that
on
the
monday
i
should
have
to
write
out
from
memory
jottings
of
the
rambling
disconnected
extempore
sermon
which
might
have
had
any
text
but
its
own
and
to
stand
or
fall
by
the
was
followed
by
a
cold
dinner
at
to
no
again
from
to
and
at
the
intervals
were
perhaps
the
greatest
trial
of
all
from
the
efforts
i
had
to
make
to
be
less
than
usually
sinful
by
reading
books
and
sermons
as
barren
as
the
dead
sea
there
was
but
one
rosy
spot
in
the
distance
all
that
day
that
was
which
never
could
come
too
early
teaching
was
well
meant
no
doubt
said
arthur
it
must
have
driven
many
of
its
victims
into
deserting
the
afraid
was
a
deserter
this
morning
she
gravely
said
had
to
write
to
eric
would
you
mind
my
telling
you
something
he
said
about
it
had
never
struck
me
in
that
light
what
light
said
arthur
that
all
nature
goes
by
fixed
regular
has
proved
so
that
asking
god
to
anything
except
of
course
praying
for
blessings
is
to
expect
a
miracle
and
no
right
to
do
not
put
it
as
well
as
did
but
that
was
the
outcome
of
it
and
it
has
confused
me
please
tell
me
what
you
can
say
in
answer
to
propose
to
discuss
difficulties
arthur
gravely
replied
as
he
is
not
present
but
if
it
is
difficulty
his
voice
unconsciously
took
a
tenderer
tone
i
will
my
difficulty
she
said
anxiously
i
will
begin
by
asking
did
you
except
blessings
is
not
your
mind
a
part
of
nature
but
comes
in
can
this
or
that
and
god
can
influence
my
you
are
not
a
fatalist
no
she
earnestly
exclaimed
god
arthur
said
to
himself
but
in
so
low
a
whisper
that
only
heard
it
grant
then
that
i
can
by
an
act
of
free
choice
move
this
cup
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
way
or
way
i
grant
let
us
see
how
far
the
result
is
produced
by
fixed
laws
the
moves
because
certain
mechanical
forces
are
impressed
on
it
by
my
my
moves
because
certain
magnetic
or
whatever
may
prove
to
impressed
on
it
by
my
this
stored
in
the
brain
would
probably
be
traceable
if
science
were
complete
to
chemical
forces
supplied
to
the
brain
by
the
blood
and
ultimately
derived
from
the
food
i
eat
and
the
air
i
would
not
that
be
fatalism
where
would
come
in
of
nerves
replied
arthur
in
the
brain
may
flow
just
as
naturally
down
one
nerve
as
down
another
we
need
something
more
than
a
fixed
law
of
nature
to
settle
nerve
shall
carry
it
that
is
her
eyes
sparkled
see
what
you
mean
she
exclaimed
is
an
exception
to
the
system
of
fixed
law
eric
said
something
like
that
and
then
i
think
he
pointed
out
that
god
can
only
influence
nature
by
influencing
human
wills
so
that
we
reasonably
pray
us
this
day
our
daily
because
many
of
the
causes
that
produce
bread
are
under
control
but
to
pray
for
rain
or
fine
weather
would
be
as
unreasonable
she
checked
herself
as
if
fearful
of
saying
something
irreverent
in
a
hushed
low
tone
that
trembled
with
emotion
and
with
the
solemnity
of
one
in
the
presence
of
death
arthur
slowly
replied
he
that
contendeth
with
the
almighty
instruct
him
shall
we
swarm
that
in
the
noontide
beam
were
born
feeling
in
ourselves
the
power
to
direct
this
way
or
that
the
forces
of
of
which
we
form
so
trivial
a
we
in
our
boundless
arrogance
in
our
pitiful
conceit
that
power
to
the
ancient
of
days
saying
to
our
creator
far
and
no
further
thou
madest
but
thou
canst
not
rule
lady
muriel
had
covered
her
face
in
her
hands
and
did
not
look
up
she
only
murmured
thanks
again
and
again
we
rose
to
go
arthur
said
with
evident
effort
word
more
if
you
would
the
power
of
anything
and
everything
that
man
can
it
and
it
shall
be
given
tried
it
i
that
god
answers
prayer
our
walk
home
was
a
silent
one
till
we
had
nearly
reached
the
lodgings
then
arthur
it
was
almost
an
echo
of
my
own
knowest
thou
o
wife
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
husband
the
subject
was
not
touched
on
again
we
sat
on
talking
while
hour
after
hour
of
this
our
last
night
together
glided
away
unnoticed
he
had
much
to
tell
me
about
india
and
the
new
life
he
was
going
to
and
the
he
hoped
to
do
and
his
great
generous
soul
seemed
so
filled
with
noble
ambition
as
to
have
no
space
left
for
any
vain
regret
or
selfish
repining
it
is
nearly
morning
arthur
said
at
last
rising
and
leading
the
way
upstairs
sun
will
be
rising
in
a
few
minutes
and
though
i
basely
defrauded
you
of
your
last
chance
of
a
rest
here
sure
forgive
me
for
i
really
bring
myself
to
say
sooner
and
god
knows
whether
ever
see
me
again
or
hear
of
me
of
you
i
am
certain
i
shall
i
warmly
responded
and
quoted
the
concluding
lines
of
that
strange
poem
never
star
was
lost
here
but
it
rose
afar
look
east
where
whole
new
thousands
are
in
what
avatar
look
eastward
arthur
eagerly
replied
pausing
at
the
window
which
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
sea
and
the
eastward
horizon
west
is
the
fitting
tomb
for
all
the
sorrow
and
the
sighing
all
the
errors
and
the
follies
of
the
past
for
all
its
withered
hopes
and
all
its
buried
loves
from
the
east
comes
new
strength
new
ambition
new
hope
new
life
new
love
look
eastward
aye
look
eastward
his
last
words
were
still
ringing
in
my
ears
as
i
entered
my
room
and
undrew
the
just
in
time
to
see
the
sun
burst
in
glory
from
his
and
clothe
the
world
in
the
light
of
a
new
day
may
it
be
for
him
and
me
and
all
of
us
i
mused
that
is
evil
and
dead
and
hopeless
fading
with
the
night
that
is
past
all
that
is
good
and
living
and
hopeful
rising
with
the
dawn
of
day
with
the
night
the
chilly
mists
and
the
noxious
vapours
and
the
heavy
shadows
and
the
wailing
gusts
and
the
melancholy
hootings
rising
with
the
day
the
darting
shafts
of
light
and
the
wholesome
morning
breeze
and
the
warmth
of
a
dawning
life
and
the
mad
music
of
the
lark
look
eastward
with
the
night
the
clouds
of
ignorance
and
the
deadly
blight
of
sin
and
the
silent
tears
of
sorrow
and
ever
rising
higher
higher
with
the
day
the
radiant
dawn
of
knowledge
and
the
sweet
breath
of
purity
and
the
throb
of
a
ecstasy
look
eastward
illustration
eastward
with
the
night
the
memory
of
a
dead
love
and
the
withered
leaves
of
a
blighted
hope
and
the
sickly
repinings
and
moody
regrets
that
numb
the
best
energies
of
the
soul
and
rising
broadening
rolling
upward
like
a
living
flood
the
manly
resolve
and
the
dauntless
will
and
the
heavenward
gaze
of
substance
of
things
hoped
for
the
evidence
of
things
