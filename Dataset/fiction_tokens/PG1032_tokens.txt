the

follows
that
of
the
definitive
edition
in
great
chapter
i
the
poor
young
man
hesitated
and
procrastinated
it
cost
him
such
an
effort
to
broach
the
subject
of
terms
to
speak
of
money
to
a
person
who
spoke
only
of
feelings
and
as
it
were
of
the
aristocracy
yet
he
was
unwilling
to
take
leave
treating
his
engagement
as
settled
without
some
more
conventional
glance
in
that
direction
than
he
could
find
an
opening
for
in
the
manner
of
the
large
affable
lady
who
sat
there
drawing
a
pair
of
soiled
gants
de
su√®de
through
a
fat
jewelled
hand
and
at
once
pressing
and
gliding
repeated
over
and
over
everything
but
the
thing
he
would
have
liked
to
hear
he
would
have
liked
to
hear
the
figure
of
his
salary
but
just
as
he
was
nervously
about
to
sound
that
note
the
little
boy
came
little
boy
moreen
had
sent
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
her
fan
he
came
back
without
the
fan
only
with
the
casual
observation
that
he
find
it
as
he
dropped
this
cynical
confession
he
looked
straight
and
hard
at
the
candidate
for
the
honour
of
taking
his
education
in
hand
this
personage
reflected
somewhat
grimly
that
the
thing
he
should
have
to
teach
his
little
charge
would
be
to
appear
to
address
himself
to
his
mother
when
he
spoke
to
not
to
make
her
such
an
improper
answer
as
that
when
moreen
bethought
herself
of
this
pretext
for
getting
rid
of
their
companion
pemberton
supposed
it
was
precisely
to
approach
the
delicate
subject
of
his
remuneration
but
it
had
been
only
to
say
some
things
about
her
son
that
it
was
better
a
boy
of
eleven
catch
they
were
extravagantly
to
his
advantage
save
when
she
lowered
her
voice
to
sigh
tapping
her
left
side
familiarly
all
overclouded
by
you
know
all
at
the
mercy
of
a
pemberton
gathered
that
the
weakness
was
in
the
region
of
the
heart
he
had
known
the
poor
child
was
not
robust
this
was
the
basis
on
which
he
had
been
invited
to
treat
through
an
english
lady
an
oxford
acquaintance
then
at
nice
who
happened
to
know
both
his
needs
and
those
of
the
amiable
american
family
looking
out
for
something
really
superior
in
the
way
of
a
resident
tutor
the
young
impression
of
his
prospective
pupil
who
had
come
into
the
room
as
if
to
see
for
himself
the
moment
pemberton
was
admitted
was
not
quite
the
soft
solicitation
the
visitor
had
taken
for
granted
morgan
moreen
was
somehow
sickly
without
being
and
that
he
looked
is
true
pemberton
have
enjoyed
his
being
added
to
the
suggestion
that
as
with
his
big
mouth
and
big
ears
he
really
be
called
pretty
he
might
too
utterly
fail
to
please
pemberton
was
modest
was
even
timid
and
the
chance
that
his
small
scholar
might
prove
cleverer
than
himself
had
quite
figured
to
his
anxiety
among
the
dangers
of
an
untried
experiment
he
reflected
however
that
these
were
risks
one
had
to
run
when
one
accepted
a
position
as
it
was
called
in
a
private
family
when
as
yet
university
honours
had
pecuniarily
speaking
remained
barren
at
any
rate
when
moreen
got
up
as
to
intimate
that
since
it
was
understood
he
would
enter
upon
his
duties
within
the
week
she
would
let
him
off
now
he
succeeded
in
spite
of
the
presence
of
the
child
in
squeezing
out
a
phrase
about
the
rate
of
payment
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
conscious
smile
which
seemed
a
reference
to
the
expensive
identity
it
was
not
the
fault
of
this
demonstration
which
had
in
a
sort
both
vagueness
and
point
if
the
allusion
sound
rather
vulgar
this
was
exactly
because
she
became
still
more
gracious
to
reply
i
can
assure
you
that
all
that
will
be
quite
pemberton
only
wondered
while
he
took
up
his
hat
what
was
to
amount
had
such
different
ideas
words
however
seemed
to
commit
the
family
to
a
pledge
definite
enough
to
elicit
from
the
child
a
strange
little
comment
in
the
shape
of
the
mocking
foreign
ejaculation
pemberton
in
some
confusion
glanced
at
him
as
he
walked
slowly
to
the
window
with
his
back
turned
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
the
air
in
his
elderly
shoulders
of
a
boy
who
play
the
young
man
wondered
if
he
should
be
able
to
teach
him
to
play
though
his
mother
had
said
it
would
never
do
and
that
this
was
why
school
was
impossible
moreen
exhibited
no
discomfiture
she
only
continued
blandly
moreen
will
be
delighted
to
meet
your
wishes
as
i
told
you
he
has
been
called
to
london
for
a
week
as
soon
as
he
comes
back
you
shall
have
it
out
with
this
was
so
frank
and
friendly
that
the
young
man
could
only
reply
laughing
as
his
hostess
laughed
i
imagine
we
shall
have
much
of
a
give
you
anything
you
like
the
boy
remarked
unexpectedly
returning
from
the
window
mind
what
anything
live
awfully
darling
too
quaint
his
mother
exclaimed
putting
out
to
caress
him
a
practised
but
ineffectual
hand
he
slipped
out
of
it
but
looked
with
intelligent
innocent
eyes
at
pemberton
who
had
already
had
time
to
notice
that
from
one
moment
to
the
other
his
small
satiric
face
seemed
to
change
its
time
of
life
at
this
moment
it
was
infantine
yet
it
appeared
also
to
be
under
the
influence
of
curious
intuitions
and
knowledges
pemberton
rather
disliked
precocity
and
was
disappointed
to
find
gleams
of
it
in
a
disciple
not
yet
in
his
teens
nevertheless
he
divined
on
the
spot
that
morgan
prove
a
bore
he
would
prove
on
the
contrary
a
source
of
agitation
this
idea
held
the
young
man
in
spite
of
a
certain
repulsion
pompous
little
person
not
extravagant
moreen
gaily
protested
making
another
unsuccessful
attempt
to
draw
the
boy
to
her
side
must
know
what
to
expect
she
went
on
to
pemberton
less
you
expect
the
better
her
companion
interposed
we
people
of
so
far
as
make
us
so
moreen
tenderly
mocked
then
on
tell
me
mind
you
fail
us
then
see
us
all
so
sorry
the
girls
are
out
i
guess
like
the
girls
and
you
know
another
son
quite
different
from
this
tries
to
imitate
me
morgan
said
to
their
friend
tries
why
twenty
years
old
cried
moreen
very
witty
pemberton
remarked
to
the
proposition
his
mother
echoed
with
enthusiasm
declaring
sallies
to
be
the
delight
of
the
house
the
boy
paid
no
heed
to
this
he
only
enquired
abruptly
of
the
visitor
who
was
surprised
afterwards
that
he
struck
him
as
offensively
forward
you
very
much
to
come
you
doubt
it
after
such
a
description
of
what
i
shall
hear
pemberton
replied
yet
he
want
to
come
at
all
he
was
coming
because
he
had
to
go
somewhere
thanks
to
the
collapse
of
his
fortune
at
the
end
of
a
year
abroad
spent
on
the
system
of
putting
his
scant
patrimony
into
a
single
full
wave
of
experience
he
had
had
his
full
wave
but
pay
the
score
at
his
inn
moreover
he
had
caught
in
the
eyes
the
glimpse
of
a
appeal
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
said
morgan
with
which
he
turned
away
again
he
passed
out
of
one
of
the
long
windows
pemberton
saw
him
go
and
lean
on
the
parapet
of
the
terrace
he
remained
there
while
the
young
man
took
leave
of
his
mother
who
on
looking
as
if
he
expected
a
farewell
from
him
interposed
with
him
leave
him
so
strange
pemberton
supposed
her
to
fear
something
he
might
say
a
love
him
she
added
much
the
most
interesting
person
in
the
and
before
he
could
invent
some
civility
to
oppose
to
this
she
wound
up
with
all
good
you
know
a
love
him
were
words
that
recurred
to
our
aspirant
before
the
friday
suggesting
among
many
things
that
geniuses
were
not
invariably
loveable
however
it
was
all
the
better
if
there
was
an
element
that
would
make
tutorship
absorbing
he
had
perhaps
taken
too
much
for
granted
it
would
only
disgust
him
as
he
left
the
villa
after
his
interview
he
looked
up
at
the
balcony
and
saw
the
child
leaning
over
it
shall
have
great
larks
he
called
up
morgan
hung
fire
a
moment
and
then
gaily
returned
the
time
you
come
back
i
shall
have
thought
of
something
witty
this
made
pemberton
say
to
himself
all
rather
chapter
ii
on
the
friday
he
saw
them
all
as
moreen
had
promised
for
her
husband
had
come
back
and
the
girls
and
the
other
son
were
at
home
moreen
had
a
white
moustache
a
confiding
manner
and
in
his
buttonhole
the
ribbon
of
a
foreign
as
pemberton
eventually
learned
for
services
for
what
services
he
never
clearly
ascertained
this
was
a
of
a
large
manner
never
confided
what
it
emphatically
did
confide
was
that
he
was
even
more
a
man
of
the
world
than
you
might
first
make
out
ulick
the
firstborn
was
in
visible
training
for
the
same
the
disadvantage
as
yet
however
of
a
buttonhole
but
feebly
floral
and
a
moustache
with
no
pretensions
to
type
the
girls
had
hair
and
figures
and
manners
and
small
fat
feet
but
had
never
been
out
alone
as
for
moreen
pemberton
saw
on
a
nearer
view
that
her
elegance
was
intermittent
and
her
parts
always
match
her
husband
as
she
had
promised
met
with
enthusiasm
ideas
in
regard
to
a
salary
the
young
man
had
endeavoured
to
keep
these
stammerings
modest
and
moreen
made
it
no
secret
that
found
them
wanting
in
he
further
mentioned
that
he
aspired
to
be
intimate
with
his
children
to
be
their
best
friend
and
that
he
was
always
looking
out
for
them
that
was
what
he
went
off
for
to
london
and
other
look
out
and
this
vigilance
was
the
theory
of
life
as
well
as
the
real
occupation
of
the
whole
family
they
all
looked
out
for
they
were
very
frank
on
the
subject
of
its
being
necessary
they
desired
it
to
be
understood
that
they
were
earnest
people
and
also
that
their
fortune
though
quite
adequate
for
earnest
people
required
the
most
careful
administration
moreen
as
the
parent
bird
sought
sustenance
for
the
nest
ulick
invoked
support
mainly
at
the
club
where
pemberton
guessed
that
it
was
usually
served
on
green
cloth
the
girls
used
to
do
up
their
hair
and
their
frocks
themselves
and
our
young
man
felt
appealed
to
to
be
glad
in
regard
to
education
that
though
it
must
naturally
be
of
the
best
it
cost
too
much
after
a
little
he
glad
forgetting
at
times
his
own
needs
in
the
interest
inspired
by
the
character
and
culture
and
the
pleasure
of
making
easy
terms
for
him
during
the
first
weeks
of
their
acquaintance
morgan
had
been
as
puzzling
as
a
page
in
an
unknown
different
from
the
obvious
little
who
had
misrepresented
childhood
to
pemberton
indeed
the
whole
mystic
volume
in
which
the
boy
had
been
amateurishly
bound
demanded
some
practice
in
translation
after
a
considerable
interval
there
is
something
phantasmagoria
like
a
prismatic
reflexion
or
a
serial
novel
in
memory
of
the
queerness
of
the
moreens
if
it
were
not
for
a
few
tangible
lock
of
hair
cut
by
his
own
hand
and
the
letters
received
from
him
when
they
were
whole
episode
and
the
figures
peopling
it
would
seem
too
inconsequent
for
anything
but
dreamland
their
supreme
quaintness
was
their
it
appeared
to
him
for
a
while
at
the
time
since
he
had
never
seen
a
family
so
brilliantly
equipped
for
failure
it
success
to
have
kept
him
so
hatefully
long
it
success
to
have
drawn
him
in
that
first
morning
at
d√©jeuner
the
friday
he
was
enough
to
one
that
he
utterly
committed
himself
and
this
not
by
calculation
or
on
a
signal
but
from
a
happy
instinct
which
made
them
like
a
band
of
gipsies
work
so
neatly
together
they
amused
him
as
much
as
if
they
had
really
been
a
band
of
gipsies
he
was
still
young
and
had
not
seen
much
of
the
english
years
had
been
properly
arid
therefore
the
reversed
conventions
of
the
they
had
desperate
him
as
he
had
encountered
nothing
like
them
at
oxford
still
less
had
any
such
note
been
struck
to
his
younger
american
ear
during
the
four
years
at
yale
in
which
he
had
richly
supposed
himself
to
be
reacting
against
a
puritan
strain
the
reaction
of
the
moreens
at
any
rate
went
ever
so
much
further
he
had
thought
himself
very
sharp
that
first
day
in
hitting
them
all
off
in
his
mind
with
the
label
later
it
seemed
feeble
and
helplessly
provisional
he
yet
when
he
first
applied
it
felt
a
glow
of
an
instructor
he
was
still
from
the
apprehension
that
living
with
them
would
really
be
to
see
life
their
sociable
strangeness
was
an
intimation
of
chatter
of
tongues
their
gaiety
and
good
humour
their
infinite
dawdling
they
were
always
getting
themselves
up
but
it
took
forever
and
pemberton
had
once
found
moreen
shaving
in
the
their
french
their
italian
and
cropping
up
in
the
foreign
fluencies
their
cold
tough
slices
of
american
they
lived
on
macaroni
and
had
these
articles
prepared
in
they
knew
recipes
for
a
hundred
other
dishes
they
overflowed
with
music
and
song
were
always
humming
and
catching
each
other
up
and
had
a
sort
of
professional
acquaintance
with
continental
cities
they
talked
of
as
if
they
had
been
pickpockets
or
strolling
players
they
had
at
nice
a
villa
a
carriage
a
piano
and
a
banjo
and
they
went
to
official
parties
they
were
a
perfect
calendar
of
the
of
their
friends
which
pemberton
knew
them
when
they
were
indisposed
to
get
out
of
bed
to
go
to
and
which
made
the
week
larger
than
life
when
moreen
talked
of
them
with
paula
and
amy
their
initiations
gave
their
new
inmate
at
first
an
almost
dazzling
sense
of
culture
moreen
had
translated
something
at
some
former
author
whom
it
made
pemberton
feel
born√©
never
to
have
heard
of
they
could
imitate
venetian
and
sing
neapolitan
and
when
they
wanted
to
say
something
very
particular
communicated
with
each
other
in
an
ingenious
dialect
of
their
own
an
elastic
spoken
cipher
which
pemberton
at
first
took
for
some
patois
of
one
of
their
countries
but
which
he
on
as
he
would
not
have
grasped
provincial
development
of
spanish
or
german
the
family
morgan
explained
to
him
drolly
enough
but
the
boy
rarely
condescended
to
use
it
himself
though
he
dealt
in
colloquial
latin
as
if
he
had
been
a
little
prelate
among
all
the
with
which
memory
was
taxed
she
managed
to
squeeze
in
one
of
her
own
which
her
friends
sometimes
forgot
but
the
house
drew
a
frequented
air
from
the
number
of
fine
people
who
were
freely
named
there
and
from
several
mysterious
men
with
foreign
titles
and
english
clothes
whom
morgan
called
the
princes
and
who
on
sofas
with
the
girls
talked
french
very
sometimes
with
some
oddity
of
if
to
show
they
were
saying
nothing
improper
pemberton
wondered
how
the
princes
could
ever
propose
in
that
tone
and
so
publicly
he
took
for
granted
cynically
that
this
was
what
was
desired
of
them
then
he
recognised
that
even
for
the
chance
of
such
an
advantage
moreen
would
never
allow
paula
and
amy
to
receive
alone
these
young
ladies
were
not
at
all
timid
but
it
was
just
the
safeguards
that
made
them
so
candidly
free
it
was
a
houseful
of
bohemians
who
wanted
tremendously
to
be
philistines
in
one
respect
however
certainly
they
achieved
no
were
wonderfully
amiable
and
ecstatic
about
morgan
it
was
a
genuine
tenderness
an
artless
admiration
equally
strong
in
each
they
even
praised
his
beauty
which
was
small
and
were
as
afraid
of
him
as
if
they
felt
him
of
finer
clay
they
spoke
of
him
as
a
little
angel
and
a
touched
on
his
want
of
health
with
long
vague
faces
pemberton
feared
at
first
an
extravagance
that
might
make
him
hate
the
boy
but
before
this
happened
he
had
become
extravagant
himself
later
when
he
had
grown
rather
to
hate
the
others
it
was
a
bribe
to
patience
for
him
that
they
were
at
any
rate
nice
about
morgan
going
on
tiptoe
if
they
fancied
he
was
showing
symptoms
and
even
giving
up
to
procure
him
a
pleasure
mixed
with
this
too
was
the
oddest
wish
to
make
him
independent
as
if
they
had
felt
themselves
not
good
enough
for
him
they
passed
him
over
to
the
new
members
of
their
circle
very
much
as
if
wishing
to
force
some
charity
of
adoption
on
so
free
an
agent
and
get
rid
of
their
own
charge
they
were
delighted
when
they
saw
morgan
take
so
to
his
kind
playfellow
and
could
think
of
no
higher
praise
for
the
young
man
it
was
strange
how
they
contrived
to
reconcile
the
appearance
and
indeed
the
essential
fact
of
adoring
the
child
with
their
eagerness
to
wash
their
hands
of
him
did
they
want
to
get
rid
of
him
before
he
should
find
them
out
pemberton
was
finding
them
out
month
by
month
the
fond
family
however
this
might
be
turned
their
backs
with
exaggerated
delicacy
as
if
to
avoid
the
reproach
of
interfering
seeing
in
time
how
little
he
had
in
common
with
was
by
he
first
observed
it
they
proclaimed
it
with
complete
companion
was
moved
to
speculate
on
the
mysteries
of
transmission
the
far
jumps
of
heredity
where
his
detachment
from
most
of
the
things
they
represented
had
come
from
was
more
than
an
observer
could
certainly
had
burrowed
under
two
or
three
generations
as
for
own
estimate
of
his
pupil
it
was
a
good
while
before
he
got
the
point
of
view
so
little
had
he
been
prepared
for
it
by
the
smug
young
barbarians
to
whom
the
tradition
of
tutorship
as
hitherto
revealed
to
him
had
been
adjusted
morgan
was
scrappy
and
surprising
deficient
in
many
properties
supposed
common
to
the
genus
and
abounding
in
others
that
were
the
portion
only
of
the
supernaturally
clever
one
day
his
friend
made
a
great
stride
it
cleared
up
the
question
to
perceive
that
morgan
supernaturally
clever
and
that
though
the
formula
was
temporarily
meagre
this
would
be
the
only
assumption
on
which
one
could
successfully
deal
with
him
he
had
the
general
quality
of
a
child
for
whom
life
had
not
been
simplified
by
school
a
kind
of
homebred
sensibility
which
might
have
been
as
bad
for
himself
but
was
charming
for
others
and
a
whole
range
of
refinement
and
musical
vibrations
as
taking
as
by
wandering
about
europe
at
the
tail
of
his
migratory
tribe
this
might
not
have
been
an
education
to
recommend
in
advance
but
its
results
with
so
special
a
subject
were
as
appreciable
as
the
marks
on
a
piece
of
fine
porcelain
there
was
at
the
same
time
in
him
a
small
strain
of
stoicism
doubtless
the
fruit
of
having
had
to
begin
early
to
bear
pain
which
counted
for
pluck
and
made
it
of
less
consequence
that
he
might
have
been
thought
at
school
rather
a
polyglot
little
beast
pemberton
indeed
quickly
found
himself
rejoicing
that
school
was
out
of
the
question
in
any
million
of
boys
it
was
probably
good
for
all
but
one
and
morgan
was
that
millionth
it
would
have
made
him
comparative
and
might
have
made
him
really
require
kicking
pemberton
would
try
to
be
school
bigger
seminary
than
five
hundred
grazing
donkeys
so
that
winning
no
prizes
the
boy
would
remain
unconscious
and
irresponsible
and
because
though
life
was
already
intense
in
his
childish
nature
freshness
still
made
there
a
strong
draught
for
jokes
it
turned
out
that
even
in
the
still
air
of
various
disabilities
jokes
flourished
greatly
he
was
a
pale
lean
acute
undeveloped
little
cosmopolite
who
liked
intellectual
gymnastics
and
who
also
as
regards
the
behaviour
of
mankind
had
noticed
more
things
than
you
might
suppose
but
who
nevertheless
had
his
proper
playroom
of
superstitions
where
he
smashed
a
dozen
toys
a
day
chapter
iii
at
nice
once
toward
evening
as
the
pair
rested
in
the
open
air
after
a
walk
and
looked
over
the
sea
at
the
pink
western
lights
he
said
suddenly
to
his
comrade
you
like
it
you
with
us
all
in
this
intimate
way
dear
fellow
why
should
i
stay
if
i
do
i
know
stay
almost
sure
you
very
hope
you
mean
to
dismiss
me
said
pemberton
morgan
debated
looking
at
the
sunset
think
if
i
did
right
i
ought
i
know
supposed
to
instruct
you
in
virtue
but
in
that
case
do
very
morgan
went
on
turning
to
him
again
yes
compared
with
you
it
matter
so
much
if
you
do
lose
a
lot
of
the
way
to
look
at
it
said
pemberton
accommodatingly
they
were
silent
a
minute
after
which
the
boy
asked
you
like
my
father
and
my
mother
very
much
me
yes
charming
morgan
received
this
with
another
silence
then
unexpectedly
familiarly
but
at
the
same
time
affectionately
he
remarked
a
jolly
old
humbug
for
a
particular
reason
the
words
made
our
young
man
change
colour
the
boy
noticed
in
an
instant
that
he
had
turned
red
whereupon
he
turned
red
himself
and
pupil
and
master
exchanged
a
longish
glance
in
which
there
was
a
consciousness
of
many
more
things
than
are
usually
touched
upon
even
tacitly
in
such
a
relation
it
produced
for
pemberton
an
embarrassment
it
raised
in
a
shadowy
form
a
was
the
first
glimpse
of
to
play
a
singular
and
as
he
imagined
owing
to
the
altogether
peculiar
conditions
an
unprecedented
part
in
his
intercourse
with
his
little
companion
later
when
he
found
himself
talking
with
the
youngster
in
a
way
in
which
few
youngsters
could
ever
have
been
talked
with
he
thought
of
that
clumsy
moment
on
the
bench
at
nice
as
the
dawn
of
an
understanding
that
had
broadened
what
had
added
to
the
clumsiness
then
was
that
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
declare
to
morgan
that
he
might
abuse
him
pemberton
as
much
as
he
liked
but
must
never
abuse
his
parents
to
this
morgan
had
the
easy
retort
that
he
dreamed
of
abusing
them
which
appeared
to
be
true
it
put
pemberton
in
the
wrong
why
am
i
a
humbug
for
saying
think
them
charming
the
young
man
asked
conscious
of
a
certain
rashness
not
your
love
you
better
than
anything
in
the
forget
that
said
pemberton
that
why
you
like
them
so
much
very
kind
to
me
pemberton
replied
evasively
a
humbug
laughed
morgan
passing
an
arm
into
his
he
leaned
against
him
looking
oft
at
the
sea
again
and
swinging
his
long
thin
legs
kick
my
shins
said
pemberton
while
he
reflected
it
i
complain
of
them
to
the
child
another
reason
too
morgan
went
on
keeping
his
legs
still
reason
for
what
their
not
being
your
understand
you
said
pemberton
you
will
before
long
all
right
he
did
understand
fully
before
long
but
he
made
a
fight
even
with
himself
before
he
confessed
it
he
thought
it
the
oddest
thing
to
have
a
struggle
with
the
child
about
he
wondered
he
hate
the
hope
of
the
moreens
for
bringing
the
struggle
on
but
by
the
time
it
began
any
such
sentiment
for
that
scion
was
closed
to
him
morgan
was
a
special
case
and
to
know
him
was
to
accept
him
on
his
own
odd
terms
pemberton
had
spent
his
aversion
to
special
cases
before
arriving
at
knowledge
when
at
last
he
did
arrive
his
quandary
was
great
against
every
interest
he
had
attached
himself
they
would
have
to
meet
things
together
before
they
went
home
that
evening
at
nice
the
boy
had
said
clinging
to
his
arm
at
any
rate
hang
on
to
the
the
last
fairly
ought
to
be
fairly
beaten
cried
the
young
man
drawing
him
closer
chapter
iv
a
year
after
he
had
come
to
live
with
them
and
moreen
suddenly
gave
up
the
villa
at
nice
pemberton
had
got
used
to
suddenness
having
seen
it
practised
on
a
considerable
scale
during
two
jerky
little
in
switzerland
the
first
summer
and
the
other
late
in
the
winter
when
they
all
ran
down
to
florence
and
then
at
the
end
of
ten
days
liking
it
much
less
than
they
had
intended
straggled
back
in
mysterious
depression
they
had
returned
to
nice
ever
as
they
said
but
this
prevent
their
squeezing
one
rainy
muggy
may
night
into
a
could
never
tell
by
which
class
they
would
pemberton
helped
them
to
stow
away
a
wonderful
collection
of
bundles
and
bags
the
explanation
of
this
man≈ìuvre
was
that
they
had
determined
to
spend
the
summer
some
bracing
but
in
paris
they
dropped
into
a
small
furnished
fourth
floor
in
a
avenue
where
there
was
a
smell
on
the
staircase
and
the
portier
was
passed
the
next
four
months
in
blank
indigence
the
better
part
of
this
baffled
sojourn
was
for
the
preceptor
and
his
pupil
who
visiting
the
invalides
and
notre
dame
the
conciergerie
and
all
the
museums
took
a
hundred
remunerative
rambles
they
learned
to
know
their
paris
which
was
useful
for
they
came
back
another
year
for
a
longer
stay
the
general
character
of
which
in
memory
mixes
pitiably
and
confusedly
with
that
of
the
first
he
sees
shabby
everlasting
pair
that
match
his
blouse
and
that
as
he
grew
longer
could
only
grow
faded
he
remembers
the
particular
holes
in
his
three
or
four
pair
of
coloured
stockings
morgan
was
dear
to
his
mother
but
he
never
was
better
dressed
than
was
absolutely
no
doubt
by
his
own
fault
for
he
was
as
indifferent
to
his
appearance
as
a
german
philosopher
dear
fellow
you
coming
to
pieces
pemberton
would
say
to
him
in
sceptical
remonstrance
to
which
the
child
would
reply
looking
at
him
serenely
up
and
down
dear
fellow
so
are
you
i
want
to
cast
you
in
the
pemberton
could
have
no
rejoinder
for
assertion
so
closely
represented
the
fact
if
however
the
deficiencies
of
his
own
wardrobe
were
a
chapter
by
themselves
he
like
his
little
charge
to
look
too
poor
later
he
used
to
say
if
poor
why
after
all
we
look
it
and
he
consoled
himself
with
thinking
there
was
something
rather
elderly
and
gentlemanly
in
differed
from
the
untidiness
of
the
urchin
who
plays
and
spoils
his
things
he
could
trace
perfectly
the
degrees
by
which
in
proportion
as
her
little
son
confined
himself
to
his
tutor
for
society
moreen
shrewdly
forbore
to
renew
his
garments
she
did
nothing
that
show
neglected
him
because
he
escaped
notice
and
then
as
he
illustrated
this
clever
policy
discouraged
at
home
his
public
appearances
her
position
was
logical
members
of
her
family
who
did
show
had
to
be
showy
during
this
period
and
several
others
pemberton
was
quite
aware
of
how
he
and
his
comrade
might
strike
people
wandering
languidly
through
the
jardin
des
plantes
as
if
they
had
nowhere
to
go
sitting
on
the
winter
days
in
the
galleries
of
the
louvre
so
splendidly
ironical
to
the
homeless
as
if
for
the
advantage
of
the
calorif√®re
they
joked
about
it
sometimes
it
was
the
sort
of
joke
that
was
perfectly
within
the
compass
they
figured
themselves
as
part
of
the
vast
vague
multitude
of
the
enormous
city
and
pretended
they
were
proud
of
their
position
in
showed
them
a
lot
of
and
made
them
conscious
of
a
democratic
brotherhood
if
pemberton
feel
a
sympathy
in
destitution
with
his
small
after
all
fond
parents
would
never
have
let
him
really
boy
would
at
least
feel
it
with
him
so
it
came
to
the
same
thing
he
used
sometimes
to
wonder
what
people
would
think
they
fancy
they
were
looked
askance
at
as
if
it
might
be
a
suspected
case
of
kidnapping
morgan
be
taken
for
a
young
patrician
with
a
smart
enough
though
he
might
pass
for
his
sickly
little
brother
now
and
then
he
had
a
piece
and
except
once
when
they
bought
a
couple
of
lovely
neckties
one
of
which
he
made
pemberton
accept
they
laid
it
out
scientifically
in
old
books
this
was
sure
to
be
a
great
day
always
spent
on
the
quays
in
a
rummage
of
the
dusty
boxes
that
garnish
the
parapets
such
occasions
helped
them
to
live
for
their
books
ran
low
very
soon
after
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
pemberton
had
a
good
many
in
england
but
he
was
obliged
to
write
to
a
friend
and
ask
him
kindly
to
get
some
fellow
to
give
him
something
for
them
if
they
had
to
relinquish
that
summer
the
advantage
of
the
bracing
climate
the
young
man
but
suspect
this
failure
of
the
cup
when
at
their
very
lips
to
have
been
the
effect
of
a
rude
jostle
of
his
own
this
had
represented
his
first
as
he
called
it
with
his
patrons
his
first
successful
there
was
little
other
success
about
bring
them
to
a
consideration
of
his
impossible
position
as
the
ostensible
eve
of
a
costly
journey
the
moment
had
struck
him
as
favourable
to
an
earnest
protest
the
presentation
of
an
ultimatum
ridiculous
as
it
sounded
he
had
never
yet
been
able
to
compass
an
uninterrupted
private
interview
with
the
elder
pair
or
with
either
of
them
singly
they
were
always
flanked
by
their
elder
children
and
poor
pemberton
usually
had
his
own
little
charge
at
his
side
he
was
conscious
of
its
being
a
house
in
which
the
surface
of
delicacy
got
rather
smudged
nevertheless
he
had
preserved
the
bloom
of
his
scruple
against
announcing
to
and
moreen
with
publicity
that
he
be
able
to
go
on
longer
without
a
little
money
he
was
still
simple
enough
to
suppose
ulick
and
paula
and
amy
might
not
know
that
since
his
arrival
he
had
only
had
a
hundred
and
forty
francs
and
he
was
magnanimous
enough
to
wish
not
to
compromise
their
parents
in
their
eyes
moreen
now
listened
to
him
as
he
listened
to
every
one
and
to
every
thing
like
a
man
of
the
world
and
seemed
to
appeal
to
not
of
course
too
try
and
be
a
little
more
of
one
himself
pemberton
recognised
in
fact
the
importance
of
the
the
advantage
it
gave
moreen
he
was
not
even
confused
or
embarrassed
whereas
the
young
man
in
his
service
was
more
so
than
there
was
any
reason
for
neither
was
he
least
any
more
than
a
gentleman
had
to
be
who
freely
confessed
himself
a
little
not
perhaps
strictly
at
pemberton
must
go
into
this
we
dear
he
said
to
his
wife
he
assured
his
young
friend
that
the
matter
should
have
his
very
best
attention
and
he
melted
into
space
as
elusively
as
if
at
the
door
he
were
taking
an
inevitable
but
deprecatory
precedence
when
the
next
moment
pemberton
found
himself
alone
with
moreen
it
was
to
hear
her
say
see
i
the
roundness
of
her
chin
and
looking
as
if
she
were
only
hesitating
between
a
dozen
easy
remedies
if
they
make
their
push
moreen
could
at
least
disappear
for
several
days
during
his
absence
his
wife
took
up
the
subject
again
spontaneously
but
her
contribution
to
it
was
merely
that
she
had
thought
all
the
while
they
were
getting
on
so
beautifully
reply
to
this
revelation
was
that
unless
they
immediately
put
down
something
on
account
he
would
leave
them
on
the
spot
and
for
ever
he
knew
she
would
wonder
how
he
would
get
away
and
for
a
moment
expected
her
to
enquire
she
for
which
he
was
almost
grateful
to
her
so
little
was
he
in
a
position
to
tell
you
you
too
interested
she
said
are
interested
you
know
you
are
you
dear
kind
man
she
laughed
with
almost
condemnatory
archness
as
if
it
were
a
she
insist
and
flirted
a
soiled
at
him
mind
was
fully
made
up
to
take
his
step
the
following
week
this
would
give
him
time
to
get
an
answer
to
a
letter
he
had
despatched
to
england
if
he
did
in
the
event
nothing
of
the
is
if
he
stayed
another
year
and
then
went
away
only
for
three
was
not
merely
because
before
the
answer
to
his
letter
came
most
unsatisfactory
when
it
did
arrive
moreen
generously
counted
out
to
him
and
again
with
the
sacrifice
to
of
a
marked
man
of
the
world
three
hundred
francs
in
elegant
ringing
gold
he
was
irritated
to
find
that
moreen
was
right
that
he
at
the
pinch
bear
to
leave
the
child
this
stood
out
clearer
for
the
very
reason
that
the
night
of
his
desperate
appeal
to
his
patrons
he
had
seen
fully
for
the
first
time
where
he
was
it
another
proof
of
the
success
with
which
those
patrons
practised
their
arts
that
they
had
managed
to
avert
for
so
long
the
illuminating
flash
it
descended
on
our
friend
with
a
breadth
of
effect
which
perhaps
would
have
struck
a
spectator
as
comical
after
he
had
returned
to
his
little
servile
room
which
looked
into
a
close
court
where
a
bare
dirty
opposite
wall
took
with
the
sound
of
shrill
clatter
the
reflexion
of
lighted
back
windows
he
had
simply
given
himself
away
to
a
band
of
adventurers
the
idea
the
word
itself
wore
a
romantic
horror
for
had
always
lived
on
such
safe
lines
later
it
assumed
a
more
interesting
almost
a
soothing
sense
it
pointed
a
moral
and
pemberton
could
enjoy
a
moral
the
moreens
were
adventurers
not
merely
because
they
pay
their
debts
because
they
lived
on
society
but
because
their
whole
view
of
life
dim
and
confused
and
instinctive
like
that
of
clever
animals
was
speculative
and
rapacious
and
mean
oh
they
were
and
that
only
made
them
more
immondes
the
young
analysis
while
he
brooded
put
it
at
last
very
were
adventurers
because
they
were
toadies
and
snobs
that
was
the
completest
account
of
was
the
law
of
their
being
even
when
this
truth
became
vivid
to
their
ingenious
inmate
he
remained
unconscious
of
how
much
his
mind
had
been
prepared
for
it
by
the
extraordinary
little
boy
who
had
now
become
such
a
complication
in
his
life
much
less
could
he
then
calculate
on
the
information
he
was
still
to
owe
the
extraordinary
little
boy
chapter
v
but
it
was
during
the
ensuing
time
that
the
real
problem
came
problem
of
how
far
it
was
excusable
to
discuss
the
turpitude
of
parents
with
a
child
of
twelve
of
thirteen
of
fourteen
absolutely
inexcusable
and
quite
impossible
it
of
course
at
first
appeared
and
indeed
the
question
press
for
some
time
after
pemberton
had
received
his
three
hundred
francs
they
produced
a
temporary
lull
a
relief
from
the
sharpest
pressure
the
young
man
frugally
amended
his
wardrobe
and
even
had
a
few
francs
in
his
pocket
he
thought
the
moreens
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
almost
too
smart
as
if
they
ought
to
take
care
not
to
spoil
him
if
moreen
been
such
a
man
of
the
world
he
would
perhaps
have
spoken
of
the
freedom
of
such
neckties
on
the
part
of
a
subordinate
but
moreen
was
always
enough
a
man
of
the
world
to
let
things
had
certainly
shown
that
it
was
singular
how
pemberton
guessed
that
morgan
though
saying
nothing
about
it
knew
something
had
happened
but
three
hundred
francs
especially
when
one
owed
money
last
for
ever
and
when
the
treasure
was
boy
knew
when
it
had
did
break
ground
the
party
had
returned
to
nice
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
but
not
to
the
charming
villa
they
went
to
an
hotel
where
they
stayed
three
months
and
then
moved
to
another
establishment
explaining
that
they
had
left
the
first
because
after
waiting
and
waiting
they
get
the
rooms
they
wanted
these
apartments
the
rooms
they
wanted
were
generally
very
splendid
but
fortunately
they
never
get
i
mean
for
pemberton
who
reflected
always
that
if
they
had
got
them
there
would
have
been
a
still
scantier
educational
fund
what
morgan
said
at
last
was
said
suddenly
irrelevantly
when
the
moment
came
in
the
middle
of
a
lesson
and
consisted
of
the
apparently
unfeeling
words
ought
to
filer
you
really
pemberton
stared
he
had
learnt
enough
french
slang
from
morgan
to
know
that
to
filer
meant
to
cut
sticks
my
dear
fellow
turn
me
off
morgan
pulled
a
greek
lexicon
toward
used
a
look
out
a
word
instead
of
asking
it
of
pemberton
go
on
like
this
you
what
my
boy
know
they
pay
you
up
said
morgan
blushing
and
turning
his
leaves
pay
me
pemberton
stared
again
and
feigned
amazement
on
earth
put
that
into
your
head
has
been
there
a
long
time
the
boy
replied
rummaging
his
book
pemberton
was
silent
then
he
went
on
say
what
are
you
hunting
for
they
pay
me
hunting
for
the
greek
for
awful
whopper
morgan
dropped
that
rather
for
gross
impertinence
and
disabuse
your
mind
what
do
i
want
of
money
another
question
pemberton
was
drawn
in
different
ways
the
severely
correct
thing
would
have
been
to
tell
the
boy
that
such
a
matter
was
none
of
his
business
and
bid
him
go
on
with
his
lines
but
they
were
really
too
intimate
for
that
it
was
not
the
way
he
was
in
the
habit
of
treating
him
there
had
been
no
reason
it
should
be
on
the
other
hand
morgan
had
quite
lighted
on
the
really
be
able
to
keep
it
up
much
longer
therefore
why
not
let
him
know
real
motive
for
forsaking
him
at
the
same
time
it
decent
to
abuse
to
pupil
the
family
of
pupil
it
was
better
to
misrepresent
than
to
do
that
so
in
reply
to
his
last
exclamation
he
just
declared
to
dismiss
the
subject
that
he
had
received
several
payments
say
the
boy
ejaculated
laughing
all
right
pemberton
insisted
me
your
written
morgan
pushed
a
copybook
across
the
table
and
he
began
to
read
the
page
but
with
something
running
in
his
head
that
made
it
no
sense
looking
up
after
a
minute
or
two
he
found
the
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
felt
in
them
something
strange
then
morgan
said
not
afraid
of
the
stern
yet
seen
the
thing
you
afraid
do
you
that
justice
this
came
out
with
a
was
perfectly
evidently
gave
morgan
pleasure
thought
of
it
a
long
time
he
presently
resumed
think
of
it
any
the
boy
appeared
to
comply
and
they
had
a
comfortable
and
even
an
amusing
hour
they
had
a
theory
that
they
were
very
thorough
and
yet
they
seemed
always
to
be
in
the
amusing
part
of
lessons
the
intervals
between
the
dull
dark
tunnels
where
there
were
waysides
and
jolly
views
yet
the
morning
was
brought
to
a
violent
as
end
by
suddenly
leaning
his
arms
on
the
table
burying
his
head
in
them
and
bursting
into
tears
at
which
pemberton
was
the
more
startled
that
as
it
then
came
over
him
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
seen
the
boy
cry
and
that
the
impression
was
consequently
quite
awful
the
next
day
after
much
thought
he
took
a
decision
and
believing
it
to
be
just
immediately
acted
on
it
he
cornered
and
moreen
again
and
let
them
know
that
if
on
the
spot
they
pay
him
all
they
owed
him
he
only
leave
their
house
but
would
tell
morgan
exactly
what
had
brought
him
to
it
you
told
him
cried
moreen
with
a
pacifying
hand
on
her
bosom
warning
you
for
what
do
you
take
me
the
young
man
returned
and
moreen
looked
at
each
other
he
could
see
that
they
appreciated
as
tending
to
their
security
his
superstition
of
delicacy
and
yet
that
there
was
a
certain
alarm
in
their
relief
dear
fellow
moreen
demanded
use
can
you
have
leading
the
quiet
life
we
all
do
for
such
a
lot
of
money
question
to
which
pemberton
made
no
answer
occupied
as
he
was
in
noting
that
what
passed
in
the
mind
of
his
patrons
was
something
like
then
if
felt
that
the
child
dear
little
angel
has
judged
us
and
how
he
regards
us
and
we
been
betrayed
he
must
have
in
short
an
inference
that
rather
stirred
up
and
moreen
as
pemberton
had
desired
it
should
at
the
same
time
if
he
had
supposed
his
threat
would
do
something
towards
bringing
them
round
he
was
disappointed
to
find
them
taking
for
vulgar
their
perception
been
he
had
already
given
them
away
there
was
a
mystic
uneasiness
in
their
parental
breasts
and
that
had
been
the
inferior
sense
of
it
none
the
less
however
his
threat
did
touch
them
for
if
they
had
escaped
it
was
only
to
meet
a
new
danger
moreen
appealed
to
him
on
every
precedent
as
a
man
of
the
world
but
his
wife
had
recourse
for
the
first
time
since
his
domestication
with
them
to
a
fine
hauteur
reminding
him
that
a
devoted
mother
with
her
child
had
arts
that
protected
her
against
gross
misrepresentation
should
misrepresent
you
grossly
if
i
accused
you
of
common
honesty
our
friend
replied
but
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
sharply
thinking
he
had
not
done
himself
much
good
while
moreen
lighted
another
cigarette
he
heard
his
hostess
shout
after
him
more
touchingly
you
do
you
put
the
knife
to
throat
the
next
morning
very
early
she
came
to
his
room
he
recognised
her
knock
but
had
no
hope
she
brought
him
money
as
to
which
he
was
wrong
for
she
had
fifty
francs
in
her
hand
she
squeezed
forward
in
her
and
he
received
her
in
his
own
between
his
and
his
bed
he
had
been
tolerably
schooled
by
this
time
to
the
of
his
hosts
moreen
was
ardent
and
when
she
was
ardent
she
care
what
she
did
so
she
now
sat
down
on
his
bed
his
clothes
being
on
the
chairs
and
in
her
preoccupation
forgot
as
she
glanced
round
to
be
ashamed
of
giving
him
such
a
horrid
room
what
ardour
now
bore
upon
was
the
design
of
persuading
him
that
in
the
first
place
she
was
very
to
bring
him
fifty
francs
and
that
in
the
second
if
he
would
only
see
it
he
was
really
too
absurd
to
expect
to
be
paid
he
paid
enough
without
perpetual
he
paid
by
the
comfortable
luxurious
home
he
enjoyed
with
them
all
without
a
care
an
anxiety
a
solitary
want
he
sure
of
his
position
and
that
everything
to
a
young
man
like
him
quite
unknown
with
singularly
little
to
show
the
ground
of
whose
exorbitant
pretensions
it
had
never
been
easy
to
discover
he
paid
above
all
by
the
sweet
relation
he
had
established
with
ideal
as
from
master
to
by
the
simple
privilege
of
knowing
and
living
with
so
amazingly
gifted
a
child
than
whom
really
and
she
meant
literally
what
she
said
there
was
no
better
company
in
europe
moreen
herself
took
to
appealing
to
him
as
a
man
of
the
world
she
said
mon
cher
and
dear
man
look
here
and
urged
him
to
be
reasonable
putting
it
before
him
that
it
was
truly
a
chance
for
him
she
spoke
as
if
according
as
he
be
reasonable
he
would
prove
himself
worthy
to
be
her
tutor
and
of
the
extraordinary
confidence
they
had
placed
in
him
after
all
pemberton
reflected
it
was
only
a
difference
of
theory
and
the
theory
matter
much
they
had
hitherto
gone
on
that
of
remunerated
as
now
they
would
go
on
that
of
gratuitous
service
but
why
should
they
have
so
many
words
about
it
moreen
at
all
events
continued
to
be
convincing
sitting
there
with
her
fifty
francs
she
talked
and
reiterated
as
women
reiterate
and
bored
and
irritated
him
while
he
leaned
against
the
wall
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
wrapper
drawing
it
together
round
his
legs
and
looking
over
the
head
of
his
visitor
at
the
grey
negations
of
his
window
she
wound
up
with
saying
see
i
bring
you
a
definite
definite
proposal
make
our
relations
regular
as
it
put
them
on
a
comfortable
a
system
said
pemberton
kind
of
organised
moreen
bounded
up
which
was
exactly
what
he
wanted
do
you
mean
by
that
practise
on
fears
about
the
child
if
one
should
go
pray
what
would
happen
to
him
in
that
event
she
demanded
with
majesty
be
alone
with
pray
with
whom
a
child
be
but
with
those
whom
he
loves
most
you
think
that
why
you
dismiss
me
you
pretend
he
loves
you
more
than
he
loves
cried
moreen
think
he
ought
to
i
make
sacrifices
for
him
though
heard
of
those
make
i
see
moreen
stared
a
moment
then
with
emotion
she
grasped
her
hand
you
make
sacrifice
he
burst
out
laughing
see
do
what
i
can
stay
a
little
longer
your
hate
intensely
to
give
him
up
fond
of
him
and
he
thoroughly
interests
me
in
spite
of
the
inconvenience
i
suffer
you
know
my
situation
perfectly
i
a
penny
in
the
world
and
occupied
as
you
see
me
with
morgan

unable
to

tapped
her

what

moreen
with

to

me
who
you

it
pemberton
paused
a
moment
and
she
said
nothing
so
he
added
tried
to
turn
off
some
little
sketches
but
the
magazines
have
declined
with
see
then
not
such
a
ph≈ìnix
his
visitor
pointedly
pretend
to
abilities
sacrificing
for
our
time
to
do
things
properly
he
ruefully
went
on
then
as
it
came
over
him
that
he
was
almost
abjectly
to
give
these
explanations
he
added
i
stay
on

it
must
be
on
one
morgan
shall
know
distinctly
on
what
footing
i
moreen
demurred
you

to
show
off
to
a
child
show
off
do
you
mean
again
she
cast
about
but
this
time
it
was
to
produce
a
still
finer
flower
talk
of
blackmail
can
easily
prevent
it
said
pemberton

of
practising
on
fears

bravely
pushed
on
no
doubt
a
great

patroness
met
his
was
clear
she
was
in
straits
then
she
thrust
out
her
money
at
him
moreen
desired
me
to
give
you
this
on
much
obliged
to
moreen
but
we
no

it
leaves
me
more
free
said
pemberton
poison
my
mind
groaned
moreen
your
the
young
man
laughed
she
fixed
him
a
moment
and
he
thought
she
was
going
to
break
out
tormentedly
pleadingly
sake
tell
me
what
in
it
but
she
checked
this
was
stronger
she
pocketed
the
crudity
of
the
alternative
was
swept
out
of
the
room
with
the
desperate
concession
may
tell
him
any
horror
you
like
chapter
vi
a
couple
of
days
after
this
during
which
he
had
failed
to
profit
by
so
free
a
permission
he
had
been
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walking
with
his
charge
in
silence
when
the
boy
became
sociable
again
with
the
remark
tell
you
how
i
know
it
i
know
it
through
who
in
the
world
is
nurse
i
used
to
so
many
years
ago
a
charming
woman
i
liked
her
awfully
and
she
liked
no
accounting
for
tastes
what
is
it
you
know
through
her
what
their
idea
is
she
went
away
because
they
fork
out
she
did
like
me
awfully
and
she
stayed
two
years
she
told
me
all
about
at
last
she
could
never
get
her
wages
as
soon
as
they
saw
how
much
she
liked
me
they
stopped
giving
her
anything
they
thought
stay
for
you
know
and
morgan
had
a
queer
little
conscious
lucid
look
did
stay
ever
so
long
an
she
could
she
was
only
a
poor
girl
she
used
to
send
money
to
her
mother
at
last
she
afford
it
any
longer
and
went
away
in
a
fearful
rage
one
mean
of
course
in
a
rage
against
she
cried
over
me
tremendously
she
hugged
me
nearly
to
death
she
told
me
all
about
it
the
boy
repeated
told
me
it
was
their
idea
so
i
guessed
ever
so
long
ago
that
they
have
had
the
same
idea
with
was
very
sharp
said
pemberton
she
made
you
that
z√©nobie
that
was
nature
and
experience
morgan
laughed
z√©nobie
was
a
part
of
your
i
was
a
part
of
hers
poor
dear
the
boy
wisely
sighed
part
of
very
important
part
but
i
see
how
you
know
that
been
treated
like
you
take
me
for
the
biggest
dunce
known
morgan
asked
i
been
conscious
of
what
been
through
together
been
through
dark
our
days
have
been
bright
morgan
went
on
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
he
said
dear
chap
a
hero
another
pemberton
retorted
not
but
i
a
baby
i
stand
it
any
longer
you
must
get
some
occupation
that
pays
ashamed
ashamed
quavered
the
boy
with
a
ring
of
passion
like
some
high
silver
note
from
a
small
cathedral
cloister
that
deeply
touched
his
friend
ought
to
go
off
and
live
somewhere
together
the
young
man
said
go
like
a
shot
if
take
get
some
work
that
would
keep
us
both
afloat
pemberton
continued
would
i
why
i
work
i
such
a
beastly
little
muff
as
that
comes
difficulty
is
that
your
parents
hear
of
it
never
part
with
you
they
worship
the
ground
you
tread
on
you
see
the
proof
of
it
pemberton
developed
dislike
me
they
wish
me
no
harm
very
amiable
people
but
perfectly
ready
to
expose
me
to
any
awkwardness
in
life
for
your
the
silence
in
which
morgan
received
his
fond
sophistry
struck
pemberton
somehow
as
expressive
after
a
moment
the
child
repeated
are
a
hero
then
he
added
leave
me
with
you
altogether
all
the
responsibility
they
put
me
off
on
you
from
morning
till
night
why
then
should
they
object
to
my
taking
up
with
you
completely
help
not
particularly
keen
about
my
being
helped
and
they
delight
in
thinking
of
you
as
tremendously
proud
of
not
proud
of
but
you
know
that
morgan
returned
for
the
little
matter
we
speak
of
charming
people
said
pemberton
not
taking
up
the
point
made
for
his
intelligence
but
wondering
greatly
at
the
own
and
especially
at
this
fresh
reminder
of
something
he
had
been
conscious
of
from
the
strangest
thing
in
his
large
little
composition
a
temper
a
sensibility
even
a
private
ideal
which
made
him
as
privately
disown
the
stuff
his
people
were
made
of
morgan
had
in
secret
a
small
loftiness
which
made
him
acute
about
betrayed
meanness
as
well
as
a
critical
sense
for
the
manners
immediately
surrounding
him
that
was
quite
without
precedent
in
a
juvenile
nature
especially
when
one
noted
that
it
had
not
made
this
nature
as
the
word
is
of
or
wizened
or
offensive
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
a
little
gentleman
and
had
paid
the
penalty
by
discovering
that
he
was
the
only
such
person
in
his
family
this
comparison
make
him
vain
but
it
could
make
him
melancholy
and
a
trifle
austere
while
pemberton
guessed
at
these
dim
young
things
shadows
of
shadows
he
was
partly
drawn
on
and
partly
checked
as
for
a
scruple
by
the
charm
of
attempting
to
sound
the
little
cool
shallows
that
were
so
quickly
growing
deeper
when
he
tried
to
figure
to
himself
the
morning
twilight
of
childhood
so
as
to
deal
with
it
safely
he
saw
it
was
never
fixed
never
arrested
that
ignorance
at
the
instant
he
touched
it
was
already
flushing
faintly
into
knowledge
that
there
was
nothing
that
at
a
given
moment
you
could
say
an
intelligent
child
know
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
himself
knew
too
much
to
imagine
simplicity
and
too
little
to
disembroil
his
tangle
the
boy
paid
no
heed
to
his
last
remark
he
only
went
on
have
spoken
to
them
about
their
idea
as
i
call
it
long
ago
if
i
been
sure
what
what
would
they
say
what
they
said
about
what
poor
z√©nobie
told
it
was
a
horrid
dreadful
story
that
they
had
paid
her
every
penny
they
owed
perhaps
they
had
said
pemberton
paid
you
us
pretend
they
have
and
parlons
accused
her
of
lying
and
stuck
to
historic
truth
why
i
want
to
speak
to
they
should
accuse
me
too
to
this
morgan
made
no
answer
and
his
companion
looking
down
at
boy
turned
away
his
eyes
which
had
what
he
have
trusted
himself
to
utter
right
worry
them
pemberton
pursued
for
that
they
charming
for
lying
and
cheating
say
cried
pemberton
imitating
a
little
tone
of
the
which
was
itself
an
imitation
must
be
frank
at
the
last
we
come
to
an
understanding
said
morgan
with
the
importance
of
the
small
boy
who
lets
himself
think
he
is
arranging
great
playing
at
shipwreck
or
at
indians
know
all
about
dare
say
your
father
has
his
reasons
pemberton
replied
but
too
vaguely
as
he
was
aware
lying
and
cheating
saving
and
managing
and
turning
his
means
to
the
best
account
he
has
plenty
to
do
with
his
money
an
expensive
very
expensive
morgan
concurred
in
a
manner
that
made
his
preceptor
burst
out
laughing
saving
for
said
pemberton
think
of
you
in
everything
they
might
while
about
it
save
a
the
boy
paused
and
his
friend
waited
to
hear
what
then
morgan
brought
out
oddly
little
plenty
of
that
all
right
of
it
for
the
people
they
know
no
doubt
the
people
they
know
are
you
mean
the
princes
we
abuse
the
not
they
married
married
amy
they
only
clean
out
know
everything
pemberton
declared
i
after
all
i
know
what
they
live
on
or
how
they
live
or
they
live
what
have
they
got
and
how
did
they
get
it
are
they
rich
are
they
poor
or
have
they
a
modeste
aisance
why
are
they
always
chiveying
me
one
year
like
ambassadors
and
the
next
like
paupers
who
are
they
any
way
and
what
are
they
thought
of
all
thought
of
a
lot
of
things
so
beastly
worldly
what
i
hate
it
all
they
care
about
is
to
make
an
appearance
and
to
pass
for
something
or
other
what
the
dickens
do
they
want
to
pass
for
what
they
pemberton
pause
for
a
reply
said
pemberton
treating
the
question
as
a
joke
yet
wondering
too
and
greatly
struck
with
his
intense
if
imperfect
vision
the
least
what
good
does
it
do
i
seen
the
way
people
treat
people
the
ones
they
want
to
know
take
anything
from
lie
down
and
be
trampled
on
the
nice
ones
hate
just
sicken
them
the
only
really
nice
person
we
you
sure
they
lie
down
for
me
you
lie
down
for
them
got
to
what
got
to
do
said
morgan
what
will
become
of
you
growing
up
i
shall
get
off
before
long
see
you
had
better
let
me
finish
you
pemberton
urged
lending
himself
to
the
strange
superiority
morgan
stopped
in
their
walk
looking
up
at
him
he
had
to
look
up
much
less
than
a
couple
of
years
had
grown
in
his
loose
leanness
so
long
and
high
me
he
echoed
are
such
a
lot
of
jolly
things
we
can
do
together
yet
i
want
to
turn
you
want
you
to
do
me
morgan
continued
to
look
at
him
give
you
you
mean
dear
fellow
too
clever
to
just
what
afraid
you
think
no
no
it
endure
it
separate
next
week
the
sooner
over
the
sooner
to
i
hear
of
other
promise
to
go
pemberton
said
morgan
consented
to
consider
this
be
honest
he
demanded
pretend
you
heard
much
more
likely
to
pretend
i
what
can
you
hear
of
this
way
stuck
in
a
hole
with
us
you
ought
to
be
on
the
spot
to
go
to
ought
to
go
to
would
think
you
were
tutor
said
pemberton
morgan
walked
on
and
after
a
little
had
begun
again
now
that
you
know
i
know
and
that
we
look
at
the
facts
and
keep
nothing
much
more
comfortable
it
dear
boy
so
amusing
so
interesting
that
it
will
surely
be
quite
impossible
for
me
to
forego
such
hours
as
this
made
morgan
stop
once
more
keep
something
back
oh
not
am
am
i
not
straight
got
your
idea
idea
that
i
probably
make
and
that
you
can
stick
it
out
till
too
clever
to
live
pemberton
repeated
call
it
a
mean
idea
morgan
pursued
i
shall
punish
you
by
the
way
i
hang
out
or
poison
you
pemberton
laughed
stronger
and
better
every
year
you
noticed
that
there
been
a
doctor
near
me
since
you
came
your
doctor
said
the
young
man
taking
his
arm
and
drawing
him
tenderly
on
again
morgan
proceeded
and
after
a
few
steps
gave
a
sigh
of
mingled
weariness
and
relief
now
that
we
look
at
the
facts
all
right
chapter
vii
they
looked
at
the
facts
a
good
deal
after
this
and
one
of
the
first
consequences
of
their
doing
so
was
that
pemberton
stuck
it
out
in
his
parlance
for
the
purpose
morgan
made
the
facts
so
vivid
and
so
droll
and
at
the
same
time
so
bald
and
so
ugly
that
there
was
fascination
in
talking
them
over
with
him
just
as
there
would
have
been
heartlessness
in
leaving
him
alone
with
them
now
that
the
pair
had
such
perceptions
in
common
it
was
useless
for
them
to
pretend
they
judge
such
people
but
the
very
judgement
and
the
exchange
of
perceptions
created
another
tie
morgan
had
never
been
so
interesting
as
now
that
he
himself
was
made
plainer
by
the
sidelight
of
these
confidences
what
came
out
in
it
most
was
the
small
fine
passion
of
his
pride
he
had
plenty
of
that
pemberton
much
that
one
might
perhaps
wisely
wish
for
it
some
early
bruises
he
would
have
liked
his
people
to
have
a
spirit
and
had
waked
up
to
the
sense
of
their
perpetually
eating
his
mother
would
consume
any
amount
and
his
father
would
consume
even
more
than
his
mother
he
had
a
theory
that
ulick
had
wriggled
out
of
an
at
nice
there
had
once
been
a
flurry
at
home
a
regular
panic
after
which
they
all
went
to
bed
and
took
medicine
not
to
be
accounted
for
on
any
other
supposition
morgan
had
a
romantic
imagination
led
by
poetry
and
history
and
he
would
have
liked
those
who
his
he
used
to
say
to
pemberton
with
the
humour
that
made
his
queer
delicacies
carry
themselves
with
an
air
but
their
one
idea
was
to
get
in
with
people
who
want
them
and
to
take
snubs
as
it
they
were
honourable
scars
why
people
want
them
more
he
was
own
affair
after
all
they
superficially
repulsive
they
were
a
hundred
times
cleverer
than
most
of
the
dreary
grandees
the
they
rushed
about
europe
to
catch
up
with
all
they
are
he
used
to
pronounce
with
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
to
which
pemberton
always
replied
great
moreen
troupe
why
altogether
delightful
and
if
it
for
the
hitch
that
you
and
i
feeble
performers
make
in
the
ensemble
carry
everything
before
what
the
boy
get
over
was
the
fact
that
this
particular
blight
seemed
in
a
tradition
of
so
undeserved
and
so
arbitrary
no
doubt
people
had
a
right
to
take
the
line
they
liked
but
why
should
his
people
have
liked
the
line
of
pushing
and
toadying
and
lying
and
cheating
what
had
their
decent
folk
so
far
as
he
to
them
or
what
had
he
done
to
them
who
had
poisoned
their
blood
with
the
social
ideal
the
fixed
idea
of
making
smart
acquaintances
and
getting
into
the
monde
chic
especially
when
it
was
foredoomed
to
failure
and
exposure
they
showed
so
what
they
were
after
that
was
what
made
the
people
they
wanted
not
want
and
never
a
wince
for
dignity
never
a
throb
of
shame
at
looking
each
other
in
the
face
never
any
independence
or
resentment
or
disgust
if
his
father
or
his
brother
would
only
knock
some
one
down
once
or
twice
a
year
clever
as
they
were
they
never
guessed
the
impression
they
made
they
were
as
jews
at
the
doors
of
but
was
that
the
model
one
wanted
family
to
follow
morgan
had
dim
memories
of
an
old
grandfather
the
maternal
in
new
york
whom
he
had
been
taken
across
the
ocean
at
the
age
of
five
to
see
a
gentleman
with
a
high
and
a
good
deal
of
pronunciation
who
wore
a
in
the
morning
which
made
one
wonder
what
he
wore
in
the
evening
and
had
or
was
supposed
to
have
and
something
to
do
with
the
bible
society
it
have
been
but
that
he
was
a
good
type
pemberton
himself
remembered
clancy
a
widowed
sister
of
who
was
as
irritating
as
a
moral
tale
and
had
paid
a
visit
to
the
family
at
nice
shortly
after
he
came
to
live
with
them
she
was
and
refined
as
amy
said
over
the
banjo
and
had
the
air
of
not
knowing
what
they
meant
when
they
talked
and
of
keeping
something
rather
important
back
pemberton
judged
that
what
she
kept
back
was
an
approval
of
many
of
their
ways
therefore
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
she
too
was
of
a
good
type
and
that
and
moreen
and
ulick
and
paula
and
amy
might
easily
have
been
of
a
better
one
if
they
would
but
that
they
was
more
and
more
perceptible
from
day
to
day
they
continued
to
as
morgan
called
it
and
in
due
time
became
aware
of
a
variety
of
reasons
for
proceeding
to
venice
they
mentioned
a
great
many
of
were
always
strikingly
frank
and
had
the
brightest
friendly
chatter
at
the
late
foreign
breakfast
in
especial
before
the
ladies
had
made
up
their
faces
when
they
leaned
their
arms
on
the
table
had
something
to
follow
the
demitasse
and
in
the
heat
of
familiar
discussion
as
to
what
they
to
do
fell
inevitably
into
the
languages
in
which
they
could
tutoyer
even
pemberton
liked
them
then
he
could
endure
even
ulick
when
he
heard
him
give
his
little
flat
voice
for
the
that
was
what
made
him
have
a
sneaking
kindness
for
they
were
so
out
of
the
workaday
world
and
kept
him
so
out
of
it
the
summer
had
waned
when
with
cries
of
ecstasy
they
all
passed
out
on
the
balcony
that
overhung
the
grand
canal
the
sunsets
then
were
splendid
and
the
dorringtons
had
arrived
the
dorringtons
were
the
only
reason
they
talked
of
at
breakfast
but
the
reasons
they
talk
of
at
breakfast
always
came
out
in
the
end
the
dorringtons
on
the
other
hand
came
out
very
little
or
else
when
they
did
they
was
hours
during
which
periods
moreen
and
the
girls
sometimes
called
at
their
hotel
to
see
if
they
had
returned
as
many
as
three
times
running
the
gondola
was
for
the
ladies
as
in
venice
too
there
were
which
moreen
knew
in
their
order
an
hour
after
she
arrived
she
immediately
took
one
herself
to
which
the
dorringtons
never
came
though
on
a
certain
occasion
when
pemberton
and
his
pupil
were
together
at
taking
the
best
walks
they
had
ever
had
and
haunting
a
hundred
churches
they
spent
a
great
deal
of
saw
the
old
lord
turn
up
with
moreen
and
ulick
who
showed
him
the
dim
basilica
as
if
it
belonged
to
them
pemberton
noted
how
much
less
among
its
curiosities
lord
dorrington
carried
himself
as
a
man
of
the
world
wondering
too
whether
for
such
services
his
companions
took
a
fee
from
him
the
autumn
at
any
rate
waned
the
dorringtons
departed
and
lord
verschoyle
the
eldest
son
had
proposed
neither
for
amy
nor
for
paula
one
sad
november
day
while
the
wind
roared
round
the
old
palace
and
the
rain
lashed
the
lagoon
pemberton
for
exercise
and
even
somewhat
for
moreens
were
horribly
frugal
about
fires
it
was
a
cause
of
suffering
to
their
up
and
down
the
big
bare
sala
with
his
pupil
the
scagliola
floor
was
cold
the
high
battered
casements
shook
in
the
storm
and
the
stately
decay
of
the
place
was
unrelieved
by
a
particle
of
furniture
spirits
were
low
and
it
came
over
him
that
the
fortune
of
the
moreens
was
now
even
lower
a
blast
of
desolation
a
portent
of
disgrace
and
disaster
seemed
to
draw
through
the
comfortless
hall
moreen
and
ulick
were
in
the
piazza
looking
out
for
something
strolling
drearily
in
mackintoshes
under
the
arcades
but
still
in
spite
of
mackintoshes
unmistakeable
men
of
the
world
paula
and
amy
were
in
might
have
been
thought
they
were
staying
there
to
keep
warm
pemberton
looked
askance
at
the
boy
at
his
side
to
see
to
what
extent
he
was
conscious
of
these
dark
omens
but
morgan
luckily
for
him
was
now
mainly
conscious
of
growing
taller
and
stronger
and
indeed
of
being
in
his
fifteenth
year
this
fact
was
intensely
interesting
to
him
and
the
basis
of
a
private
however
he
had
imparted
to
his
in
a
little
while
he
should
stand
on
his
own
feet
he
considered
that
the
situation
would
in
short
he
should
be
grown
up
producible
in
the
world
of
affairs
and
ready
to
prove
himself
of
sterling
ability
sharply
as
he
was
capable
at
times
of
analysing
as
he
called
it
his
life
there
were
happy
hours
when
he
remained
as
he
also
called
as
the
name
really
of
their
right
superficial
the
proof
of
which
was
his
fundamental
assumption
that
he
should
presently
go
to
oxford
to
college
and
aided
and
abetted
by
pemberton
do
the
most
wonderful
things
it
depressed
the
young
man
to
see
how
little
in
such
a
project
he
took
account
of
ways
and
means
in
other
connexions
he
mostly
kept
to
the
measure
pemberton
tried
to
imagine
the
moreens
at
oxford
and
fortunately
failed
yet
unless
they
were
to
adopt
it
as
a
residence
there
would
be
no
modus
vivendi
for
morgan
how
could
he
live
without
an
allowance
and
where
was
the
allowance
to
come
from
he
pemberton
might
live
on
morgan
but
how
could
morgan
live
on
what
was
to
become
of
him
anyhow
somehow
the
fact
that
he
was
a
big
boy
now
with
better
prospects
of
health
made
the
question
of
his
future
more
difficult
so
long
as
he
was
markedly
frail
the
great
consideration
he
inspired
seemed
enough
of
an
answer
to
it
but
at
the
bottom
of
heart
was
the
recognition
of
his
probably
being
strong
enough
to
live
and
not
yet
strong
enough
to
struggle
or
to
thrive
morgan
himself
at
any
rate
was
in
the
first
flush
of
the
rosiest
consciousness
of
adolescence
so
that
the
beating
of
the
tempest
seemed
to
him
after
all
but
the
voice
of
life
and
the
challenge
of
fate
he
had
on
his
shabby
little
overcoat
with
the
collar
up
but
was
enjoying
his
walk
it
was
interrupted
at
last
by
the
appearance
of
his
mother
at
the
end
of
the
sala
she
beckoned
him
to
come
to
her
and
while
pemberton
saw
him
complaisant
pass
down
the
long
vista
and
over
the
damp
false
marble
he
wondered
what
was
in
the
air
moreen
said
a
word
to
the
boy
and
made
him
go
into
the
room
she
had
quitted
then
having
closed
the
door
after
him
she
directed
her
steps
swiftly
to
pemberton
there
was
something
in
the
air
but
his
wildest
flight
of
fancy
have
suggested
what
it
proved
to
be
she
signified
that
she
had
made
a
pretext
to
get
morgan
out
of
the
way
and
then
she
the
young
man
could
favour
her
with
the
loan
of
three
louis
while
before
bursting
into
a
laugh
he
stared
at
her
with
surprise
she
declared
that
she
was
awfully
pressed
for
the
money
she
was
desperate
for
would
save
her
life
lady
trop
fort
pemberton
laughed
in
the
manner
and
with
the
borrowed
grace
of
idiom
that
marked
the
best
colloquial
the
best
anecdotic
moments
of
his
friends
themselves
in
the
world
do
you
suppose
i
should
get
three
louis
du
train
dont
vous
allez
thought
you
things
they
pay
you
a
you
such
a
fool
as
to
work
for
nothing
ought
surely
to
know
moreen
stared
then
she
coloured
a
little
pemberton
saw
she
had
quite
forgotten
the
they
could
be
he
had
ended
by
accepting
from
herself
they
had
burdened
her
memory
as
little
as
her
conscience
yes
i
see
what
you
been
very
nice
about
that
but
why
drag
it
in
so
often
she
had
been
perfectly
urbane
with
him
ever
since
the
rough
scene
of
explanation
in
his
room
the
morning
he
made
her
accept
necessity
of
his
making
his
case
known
to
morgan
she
had
felt
no
resentment
after
seeing
there
was
no
danger
morgan
would
take
the
matter
up
with
her
indeed
attributing
this
immunity
to
the
good
taste
of
his
influence
with
the
boy
she
had
once
said
to
pemberton
dear
fellow
an
immense
comfort
a
she
repeated
this
in
substance
now
course
a
a
bother
the
less
pemberton
reminded
her
that
he
had
not
anything
that
already
in
as
much
as
his
foot
was
in
his
shoe
and
she
also
repeated
her
prayer
that
somewhere
and
somehow
he
would
find
her
sixty
francs
he
took
the
liberty
of
hinting
that
if
he
could
find
them
it
be
to
lend
them
to
to
which
he
consciously
did
himself
injustice
knowing
that
if
he
had
them
he
would
certainly
put
them
at
her
disposal
he
accused
himself
at
bottom
and
not
unveraciously
of
a
fantastic
a
demoralised
sympathy
with
her
if
misery
made
strange
bedfellows
it
also
made
strange
sympathies
it
was
moreover
a
part
of
the
abasement
of
living
with
such
people
that
one
had
to
make
vulgar
retorts
quite
out
of
own
tradition
of
good
manners
morgan
to
what
pass
have
i
come
for
you
he
groaned
while
moreen
floated
voluminously
down
the
sala
again
to
liberate
the
boy
wailing
as
she
went
that
everything
was
too
odious
before
their
young
friend
was
liberated
there
came
a
thump
at
the
door
communicating
with
the
staircase
followed
by
the
apparition
of
a
dripping
youth
who
poked
in
his
head
pemberton
recognised
him
as
the
bearer
of
a
telegram
and
recognised
the
telegram
as
addressed
to
himself
morgan
came
back
as
after
glancing
at
the
of
a
relative
in
was
reading
the
words
a
jolly
job
for
you
engagement
to
coach
opulent
youth
on
own
terms
come
at
the
answer
happily
was
paid
and
the
messenger
waited
morgan
who
had
drawn
near
waited
too
and
looked
hard
at
pemberton
and
pemberton
after
a
moment
having
met
his
look
handed
him
the
telegram
it
was
really
by
wise
knew
each
other
so
well
while
the
in
his
waterproof
cape
made
a
great
puddle
on
the
floor
the
thing
was
settled
between
them
pemberton
wrote
the
answer
with
a
pencil
against
the
frescoed
wall
and
the
messenger
departed
when
he
had
gone
the
young
man
explained
himself
make
a
tremendous
charge
earn
a
lot
of
money
in
a
short
time
and
live
on
i
hope
the
opulent
youth
will
be
a
dismal
probably
morgan
keep
you
a
long
time
of
it
course
the
longer
he
keeps
me
the
more
we
shall
have
for
our
old
suppose
pay
you
morgan
awfully
suggested
there
are
not
two
but
pemberton
pulled
up
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
using
too
invidious
a
term
instead
of
this
he
said
such
morgan
tears
came
to
his
eyes
toujours
two
such
rascally
crews
then
in
a
different
tone
he
added
opulent
youth
if
a
dismal
happier
then
but
you
have
everything
can
you
the
boy
smiled
pemberton
held
him
fast
hands
on
his
had
never
loved
him
so
will
become
of
you
what
will
you
do
he
thought
of
moreen
desperate
for
sixty
francs
shall
become
an
homme
and
then
as
if
he
recognised
all
the
bearings
of
allusion
shall
get
on
with
them
better
when
not
say
sounds
as
if
i
set
you
against
them
sight
of
you
all
right
you
know
what
i
mean
i
shall
be
beautiful
take
their
affairs
in
hand

my
marry
yourself
joked
pemberton
as
high
rather
tense
pleasantry
would
evidently
be
the
right
or
the
safest
tone
for
their
separation
it
was
however
not
purely
in
this
strain
that
morgan
suddenly
asked
i
will
you
get
to
your
jolly
job
have
to
telegraph
to
the
opulent
youth
for
money
to
come
pemberton
bethought
himself
like
that
will
they
look
out
for
them
then
pemberton
brought
out
his
remedy
go
to
the
american
consul
borrow
some
money
of
for
the
few
days
on
the
strength
of
the
morgan
was
hilarious
him
the
collar
the
money
and
stay
pemberton
entered
into
the
joke
sufficiently
to
reply
that
for
morgan
he
was
really
capable
of
that
but
the
boy
growing
more
serious
and
to
prove
he
meant
what
he
said
not
only
hurried
him
off
to
the
he
was
to
start
that
evening
as
he
had
wired
to
his
made
sure
of
their
affair
by
going
with
him
they
splashed
through
the
tortuous
perforations
and
over
the
humpbacked
bridges
and
they
passed
through
the
piazza
where
they
saw
moreen
and
ulick
go
into
a
shop
the
consul
proved
said
it
the
letter
but
grand
on
their
way
back
they
went
into
saint
for
a
hushed
ten
minutes
later
they
took
up
and
kept
up
the
fun
of
it
to
the
very
end
and
it
seemed
to
pemberton
a
part
of
that
fun
that
moreen
who
was
very
angry
when
he
had
announced
her
his
intention
should
charge
him
grotesquely
and
vulgarly
and
in
reference
to
the
loan
she
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
effect
with
bolting
lest
they
should
something
of
him
on
the
other
hand
he
had
to
do
moreen
and
ulick
the
justice
to
recognise
that
when
on
coming
in
they
heard
the
cruel
news
they
took
it
like
perfect
men
of
the
world
chapter
viii
when
he
got
at
work
with
the
opulent
youth
who
was
to
be
taken
in
hand
for
balliol
he
found
himself
unable
to
say
if
this
aspirant
had
really
such
poor
parts
or
if
the
appearance
were
only
begotten
of
his
own
long
association
with
an
intensely
living
little
mind
from
morgan
he
heard
half
a
dozen
times
the
boy
wrote
charming
young
letters
a
patchwork
of
tongues
with
indulgent
postscripts
in
the
family
volapuk
and
in
little
squares
and
rounds
and
crannies
of
the
text
the
drollest
that
he
was
divided
between
the
impulse
to
show
his
present
charge
as
a
vain
a
wasted
incentive
and
the
sense
of
something
in
them
that
publicity
would
profane
the
opulent
youth
went
up
in
due
course
and
failed
to
pass
but
it
seemed
to
add
to
the
presumption
that
brilliancy
was
not
expected
of
him
all
at
once
that
his
parents
condoning
the
lapse
which
they
treated
as
little
as
possible
as
if
it
were
should
have
sounded
the
rally
again
begged
the
young
coach
to
renew
the
siege
the
young
coach
was
now
in
a
position
to
lend
moreen
three
louis
and
he
sent
her
a
order
even
for
a
larger
amount
in
return
for
this
favour
he
received
a
frantic
scribbled
line
from
her
you
to
come
back
dreadfully
they
were
on
there
rebound
once
more
in
as
pemberton
had
seen
them
depressed
he
had
never
seen
them
communication
was
therefore
rapid
he
wrote
to
the
boy
to
ascertain
the
state
of
his
health
but
awaited
the
answer
in
vain
he
accordingly
after
three
days
took
an
abrupt
leave
of
the
opulent
youth
and
crossing
the
channel
alighted
at
the
small
hotel
in
the
quarter
of
the
champs
elys√©es
of
which
moreen
had
given
him
the
address
a
deep
if
dumb
dissatisfaction
with
this
lady
and
her
companions
bore
him
company
they
be
vulgarly
honest
but
they
could
live
at
hotels
in
velvety
entresols
amid
a
smell
of
burnt
pastilles
surrounded
by
the
most
expensive
city
in
europe
when
he
had
left
them
in
venice
it
was
with
an
irrepressible
suspicion
that
something
was
going
to
happen
but
the
only
thing
that
could
have
taken
place
was
again
their
masterly
retreat
is
he
where
is
he
he
asked
of
moreen
but
before
she
could
speak
these
questions
were
answered
by
the
pressure
round
hid
neck
of
a
pair
of
arms
in
shrunken
sleeves
which
still
were
perfectly
capable
of
an
effusive
young
foreign
squeeze
see
it
the
young
man
cried
and
then
to
morgan
on
earth
you
relieve
me
why
you
answer
my
letter
moreen
declared
that
when
she
wrote
he
was
very
bad
and
pemberton
learned
at
the
same
time
from
the
boy
that
he
had
answered
every
letter
he
had
received
this
led
to
the
clear
inference
that
note
had
been
kept
from
him
so
that
the
game
practised
should
not
be
interfered
with
moreen
was
prepared
to
see
the
fact
exposed
as
pemberton
saw
the
moment
he
faced
her
that
she
was
prepared
for
a
good
many
other
things
she
was
prepared
above
all
to
maintain
that
she
had
acted
from
a
sense
of
duty
that
she
was
enchanted
she
had
got
him
over
whatever
they
might
say
and
that
it
was
useless
of
him
to
pretend
he
know
in
all
his
bones
that
his
place
at
such
a
time
was
with
morgan
he
had
taken
the
boy
away
from
them
and
now
had
no
right
to
abandon
him
he
had
created
for
himself
the
gravest
responsibilities
and
must
at
least
abide
by
what
he
had
done
him
away
from
you
pemberton
exclaimed
indignantly
it
for
sake
just
what
i
want
i
stand
such
scenes
awful
dears
these
words
broke
from
morgan
who
had
intermitted
his
embrace
in
a
key
which
made
pemberton
turn
quickly
to
him
and
see
that
he
had
suddenly
seated
himself
was
breathing
in
great
pain
and
was
very
pale
do
you
say
not
in
a
state
my
precious
pet
shouted
his
mother
dropping
on
her
knees
before
him
with
clasped
hands
but
touching
him
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
a
gilded
idol
will
only
for
an
instant
but
say
such
dreadful
things
all
right
morgan
panted
to
pemberton
whom
he
sat
looking
up
at
with
a
strange
smile
his
hands
resting
on
either
side
of
the
sofa
do
you
pretend
been
dishonest
that
deceived
moreen
flashed
at
pemberton
as
she
got
up
says
it
i
the
boy
returned
apparently
easier
but
sinking
back
against
the
wall
while
his
restored
friend
who
had
sat
down
beside
him
took
his
hand
and
bent
over
him
child
one
does
what
one
can
there
are
so
many
things
to
consider
urged
moreen
his
only
place
you
see
think
it
is
me
me
away
morgan
went
on
smiling
to
pemberton
with
his
white
face
shall
i
take
you
and
my
boy
the
young
man
stammered
thinking
of
the
rude
way
in
which
his
friends
in
london
held
that
for
his
convenience
with
no
assurance
of
prompt
return
he
had
thrown
them
over
of
the
just
resentment
with
which
they
would
already
have
called
in
a
successor
and
of
the
scant
help
to
finding
fresh
employment
that
resided
for
him
in
the
grossness
of
his
having
failed
to
pass
his
pupil
settle
that
you
used
to
talk
about
it
said
morgan
we
can
only
go
all
the
a
about
it
as
much
as
you
like
but
think
you
can
attempt
it
moreen
would
never
would
be
so
hostess
beautifully
explained
to
him
then
to
morgan
she
made
it
clearer
would
destroy
our
peace
it
would
break
our
hearts
now
that
back
it
will
be
all
the
same
again
have
your
life
your
work
and
your
freedom
and
all
be
happy
as
we
used
to
be
bloom
and
grow
perfectly
well
and
we
have
any
more
silly
experiments
will
we
too
absurd

place
you

yours
your

ch√©ri
all
forget
how
foolish
been
and
have
lovely
she
continued
to
talk
and
to
surge
vaguely
about
the
little
draped
stuffy
salon
while
pemberton
sat
with
the
boy
whose
colour
gradually
came
back
and
she
mixed
up
her
reasons
hinting
that
there
were
going
to
be
changes
that
the
other
children
might
scatter
who
knew
had
her
ideas
and
that
then
it
might
be
fancied
how
much
the
poor
old
would
want
the
little
nestling
morgan
looked
at
pemberton
who
let
him
move
and
pemberton
knew
exactly
how
he
felt
at
hearing
himself
called
a
little
nestling
he
admitted
that
he
had
had
one
or
two
bad
days
but
he
protested
afresh
against
the
wrong
of
his
having
made
them
the
ground
of
an
appeal
to
poor
pemberton
poor
pemberton
could
laugh
now
apart
from
the
comicality
of
mustering
so
much
philosophy
for
her
seemed
to
shake
it
out
of
her
agitated
petticoats
which
knocked
over
the
light
gilt
little
did
their
young
companion
unmistakeably
marked
at
the
best
strike
him
as
qualified
to
repudiate
any
advantage
he
himself
was
in
for
it
at
any
rate
he
should
have
morgan
on
his
hands
again
indefinitely
though
indeed
he
saw
the
lad
had
a
private
theory
to
produce
which
would
be
intended
to
smooth
this
down
he
was
obliged
to
him
for
it
in
advance
but
the
suggested
amendment
keep
his
heart
rather
from
sinking
any
more
than
it
prevented
him
from
accepting
the
prospect
on
the
spot
with
some
confidence
moreover
that
he
should
do
so
even
better
if
he
could
have
a
little
supper
moreen
threw
out
more
hints
about
the
changes
that
were
to
be
looked
for
but
she
was
such
a
mixture
of
smiles
and
confessed
she
was
very
he
tell
if
she
were
in
high
feather
or
only
in
hysterics
if
the
family
was
really
at
last
going
to
pieces
why
she
recognise
the
necessity
of
pitching
morgan
into
some
sort
of
lifeboat
this
presumption
was
fostered
by
the
fact
that
they
were
established
in
luxurious
quarters
in
the
capital
of
pleasure
that
was
exactly
where
they
naturally
be
established
in
view
of
going
to
pieces
moreover
she
mention
that
moreen
and
the
others
were
enjoying
themselves
at
the
opera
with
granger
and
also
precisely
where
one
would
look
for
them
on
the
eve
of
a
smash
pemberton
gathered
that
granger
was
a
rich
vacant
big
bill
with
a
flourishy
heading
and
no
items
so
that
one
of
was
probably
that
this
time
she
missed
which
straight
shot
indeed
she
would
have
shattered
the
general
cohesion
and
if
the
cohesion
was
to
crumble
what
would
become
of
poor
pemberton
he
felt
quite
enough
bound
up
with
them
to
figure
to
his
alarm
as
a
dislodged
block
in
the
edifice
it
was
morgan
who
eventually
asked
if
no
supper
had
been
ordered
for
him
sitting
with
him
below
later
at
the
dim
delayed
meal
in
the
presence
of
a
great
deal
of
corded
green
plush
a
plate
of
ornamental
biscuit
and
an
aloofness
marked
on
the
part
of
the
waiter
moreen
had
explained
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
secure
a
room
for
the
visitor
out
of
the
house
and
offered
it
while
pemberton
reflected
on
the
nastiness
of
lukewarm
to
be
largely
that
his
circumstance
would
facilitate
their
escape
he
talked
of
their
to
it
often
if
they
were
making
up
a
together
but
he
likewise
expressed
his
sense
that
there
was
something
in
the
air
that
the
moreens
keep
it
up
much
longer
in
point
of
fact
as
pemberton
was
to
see
they
kept
it
up
for
five
or
six
months
all
the
while
however
contention
was
designed
to
cheer
him
moreen
and
ulick
whom
he
had
met
the
day
after
his
return
accepted
that
return
like
perfect
men
of
the
world
if
paula
and
amy
treated
it
even
with
less
formality
an
allowance
was
to
be
made
for
them
inasmuch
as
granger
come
to
the
opera
after
all
he
had
only
placed
his
box
at
their
service
with
a
bouquet
for
each
of
the
party
there
was
even
one
apiece
embittering
the
thought
of
his
profusion
for
moreen
and
ulick
all
like
that
was
comment
the
very
last
just
when
we
think
landed
them
back
in
the
deep
sea
comments
in
these
days
were
more
and
more
free
they
even
included
a
large
recognition
of
the
extraordinary
tenderness
with
which
he
had
been
treated
while
pemberton
was
away
oh
yes
they
do
enough
to
be
nice
to
him
to
show
him
they
had
him
on
their
mind
and
make
up
for
his
loss
that
was
just
what
made
the
whole
thing
so
sad
and
caused
him
to
rejoice
after
all
in
had
to
keep
thinking
of
their
affection
less
had
less
sense
of
obligation
pemberton
laughed
out
at
this
last
reason
and
morgan
blushed
and
said
dash
it
you
know
what
i
pemberton
knew
perfectly
what
he
meant
but
there
were
a
good
many
things
it
too
make
any
clearer
this
episode
of
his
second
sojourn
in
paris
stretched
itself
out
wearily
with
their
resumed
readings
and
wanderings
and
maunderings
their
potterings
on
the
quays
their
hauntings
of
the
museums
their
occasional
lingerings
in
the
palais
royal
when
the
first
sharp
weather
came
on
and
there
was
a
comfort
in
warm
emanations
before
wonderful
succulent
window
morgan
wanted
to
hear
all
about
the
opulent
took
an
immense
interest
in
him
some
of
the
details
of
his
could
spare
him
none
of
fed
the
appreciation
of
all
his
friend
had
given
up
to
come
back
to
him
but
in
addition
to
the
greater
reciprocity
established
by
that
heroism
he
had
always
his
little
brooding
theory
in
which
there
was
a
frivolous
gaiety
too
that
their
long
probation
was
drawing
to
a
close
conviction
that
the
moreens
go
on
much
longer
kept
pace
with
the
unexpended
impetus
with
which
from
month
to
month
they
did
go
on
three
weeks
after
pemberton
had
rejoined
them
they
went
on
to
another
hotel
a
dingier
one
than
the
first
but
morgan
rejoiced
that
his
tutor
had
at
least
still
not
sacrificed
the
advantage
of
a
room
outside
he
clung
to
the
romantic
utility
of
this
when
the
day
or
rather
the
night
should
arrive
for
their
escape
for
the
first
time
in
this
complicated
connexion
our
friend
felt
his
collar
gall
him
it
was
as
he
had
said
to
moreen
in
venice
trop
was
trop
fort
he
could
neither
really
throw
off
his
blighting
burden
nor
find
in
it
the
benefit
of
a
pacified
conscience
or
of
a
rewarded
affection
he
had
spent
all
the
money
accruing
to
him
in
england
and
he
saw
his
youth
going
and
that
he
was
getting
nothing
back
for
it
it
was
all
very
well
of
morgan
to
count
it
for
reparation
that
he
should
now
settle
on
him
was
an
irritating
flaw
in
such
a
view
he
saw
what
the
boy
had
in
his
mind
the
conception
that
as
his
friend
had
had
the
generosity
to
come
back
he
must
show
his
gratitude
by
giving
him
his
life
but
the
poor
friend
desire
the
could
he
do
with
dreadful
little
life
of
course
at
the
same
time
that
pemberton
was
irritated
he
remembered
the
reason
which
was
very
honourable
to
morgan
and
which
dwelt
simply
in
his
making
one
so
forget
that
he
was
no
more
than
a
patched
urchin
if
one
dealt
with
him
on
a
different
basis
misadventures
were
own
fault
so
pemberton
waited
in
a
queer
confusion
of
yearning
and
alarm
for
the
catastrophe
which
was
held
to
hang
over
the
house
of
moreen
of
which
he
certainly
at
moments
felt
the
symptoms
brush
his
cheek
and
as
to
which
he
wondered
much
in
what
form
it
would
find
its
liveliest
effect
perhaps
it
would
take
the
form
of
sudden
frightened
sauve
qui
peut
a
scuttling
into
selfish
corners
certainly
they
were
less
elastic
than
of
yore
they
were
evidently
looking
for
something
they
find
the
dorringtons
the
princes
had
scattered
that
the
beginning
of
the
end
moreen
had
lost
her
reckoning
of
the
famous
her
social
calendar
was
had
turned
its
face
to
the
wall
pemberton
suspected
that
the
great
the
cruel
discomfiture
had
been
the
unspeakable
behaviour
of
granger
who
seemed
not
to
know
what
he
wanted
or
what
was
much
worse
what
they
wanted
he
kept
sending
flowers
as
if
to
bestrew
the
path
of
his
retreat
which
was
never
the
path
of
a
return
flowers
were
all
very
well
could
complete
the
proposition
it
was
now
positively
conspicuous
that
in
the
long
run
the
moreens
were
a
social
failure
so
that
the
young
man
was
almost
grateful
the
run
had
not
been
short
moreen
indeed
was
still
occasionally
able
to
get
away
on
business
and
what
was
more
surprising
was
likewise
able
to
get
back
ulick
had
no
club
but
you
have
discovered
it
from
his
appearance
which
was
as
much
as
ever
that
of
a
person
looking
at
life
from
the
window
of
such
an
institution
therefore
pemberton
was
doubly
surprised
at
an
answer
he
once
heard
him
make
his
mother
in
the
desperate
tone
of
a
man
familiar
with
the
worst
privations
her
question
pemberton
had
not
quite
caught
it
appeared
to
be
an
appeal
for
a
suggestion
as
to
whom
they
might
get
to
take
amy
the
devil
take
her
ulick
snapped
so
that
pemberton
could
see
that
they
had
not
only
lost
their
amiability
but
had
ceased
to
believe
in
themselves
he
could
also
see
that
if
moreen
was
trying
to
get
people
to
take
her
children
she
might
be
regarded
as
closing
the
hatches
for
the
storm
but
morgan
would
be
the
last
she
would
part
with
one
winter
was
a
and
the
boy
walked
far
together
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
the
evening
was
so
splendid
the
cold
sunset
so
clear
the
stream
of
carriages
and
pedestrians
so
amusing
and
the
fascination
of
paris
so
great
that
they
stayed
out
later
than
usual
and
became
aware
that
they
should
have
to
hurry
home
to
arrive
in
time
for
dinner
they
hurried
accordingly
and
hungry
agreeing
that
there
was
nothing
like
paris
after
all
and
that
after
everything
too
that
had
come
and
gone
they
were
not
yet
sated
with
innocent
pleasures
when
they
reached
the
hotel
they
found
that
though
scandalously
late
they
were
in
time
for
all
the
dinner
they
were
likely
to
sit
down
to
confusion
reigned
in
the
apartments
of
the
shabby
ones
this
time
but
the
best
in
the
before
the
interrupted
service
of
the
table
with
objects
displaced
almost
as
if
there
had
been
a
scuffle
and
a
great
from
an
overturned
bottle
pemberton
blink
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
scene
of
the
last
proprietary
firmness
the
storm
had
were
all
seeking
refuge
the
hatches
were
down
paula
and
amy
were
had
never
tried
the
most
casual
art
upon
pemberton
but
he
felt
they
had
enough
of
an
eye
to
him
not
to
wish
to
meet
him
as
young
ladies
whose
frocks
had
been
ulick
appeared
to
have
jumped
overboard
the
host
and
his
staff
in
a
word
had
ceased
to
at
the
pace
of
their
guests
and
the
air
of
embarrassed
detention
thanks
to
a
pile
of
gaping
trunks
in
the
passage
was
strangely
commingled
with
the
air
of
indignant
withdrawal
when
morgan
took
all
this
he
took
it
in
very
coloured
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
he
had
walked
from
his
infancy
among
difficulties
and
dangers
but
he
had
never
seen
a
public
exposure
pemberton
noticed
in
a
second
glance
at
him
that
the
tears
had
rushed
into
his
eyes
and
that
they
were
tears
of
a
new
and
untasted
bitterness
he
wondered
an
instant
for
the
sake
whether
he
might
successfully
pretend
not
to
understand
not
successfully
he
felt
as
and
moreen
dinnerless
by
their
extinguished
hearth
rose
before
him
in
their
little
dishonoured
salon
casting
about
with
glassy
eyes
for
the
nearest
port
in
such
a
storm
they
were
not
prostrate
but
were
horribly
white
and
moreen
had
evidently
been
crying
pemberton
quickly
learned
however
that
her
grief
was
not
for
the
loss
of
her
dinner
much
as
she
usually
enjoyed
it
but
the
fruit
of
a
blow
that
struck
even
deeper
as
she
made
all
haste
to
explain
he
would
see
for
himself
so
far
as
that
went
how
the
great
change
had
come
the
dreadful
bolt
had
fallen
and
how
they
would
now
all
have
to
turn
themselves
about
therefore
cruel
as
it
was
to
them
to
part
with
their
darling
she
must
look
to
him
to
carry
a
little
further
the
influence
he
had
so
fortunately
acquired
with
the
induce
his
young
charge
to
follow
him
into
some
modest
retreat
they
depended
on
was
the
take
their
delightful
child
temporarily
under
his
protection
it
would
leave
moreen
and
herself
so
much
more
free
to
give
the
proper
attention
too
little
alas

been
given
to
the
readjustment
of
their

rubbing
her
plump
white
hands
and
looking
with
compunction
hard
at

take
liberties
her
husband
stroked
with
a
paternal
forefinger

that

pursued
pemberton
wondered
again
if
he
might
pretend
not
to
understand
but
everything
good
gave
way
to
the
intensity
of
understanding
you
mean
he
may
take
me
to
live
with
him
for
ever
and
ever

the
boy

a
light
in
his
face
his
sense
of
shame
for
their
common
humiliated
state
had
dropped
the
case
had
another
thing
was
to
clutch
at
he
had
a
moment
of
boyish
joy
scarcely
mitigated
by
the
reflexion
that
with
this
unexpected
consecration
of
his
sudden
and
too
violent
the
turn
taken
was
away
from
a
was
left
on
their
hands
the
boyish
joy
was
there
an
instant
and
pemberton
was
almost
scared
at
the
rush
of
gratitude
and
affection
that
broke
through
his
first
abasement
when
he
stammered
dear
fellow
what
do
you
say
to
how
could
one
not
say
something
enthusiastic
but
there
was
more
need
for
courage
at
something
else
that
immediately
followed
and
that
made
the
lad
sit
down
quietly
on
the
nearest
chair
he
had
turned
quite
livid
and
had
raised
his
hand
to
his
left
side
they
were
all
three
looking
at
him
but
moreen
suddenly
bounded
forward
his
darling
little
heart
she
broke
out
and
this
time
on
her
knees
before
him
and
without
respect
for
the
idol
she
caught
him
ardently
in
her
arms
walked
him
too
far
you
hurried
him
too
fast
she
hurled
over
her
shoulder
at
pemberton
her
son
made
no
protest
and
the
next
instant
still
holding
him
she
sprang
up
with
her
face
convulsed
and
with
the
terrified
cry
help
going
gone
pemberton
saw
with
equal
horror
by
own
stricken
face
that
he
was
beyond
their
wildest
recall
he
pulled
him
half
out
of
his
hands
and
for
a
moment
while
they
held
him
together
they
looked
all
their
dismay
into
each

his
weak
