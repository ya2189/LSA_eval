chapter
i
off
for
europe
off
at
last
hurrah
the
tramp
steamer
eagle
swung
out
from
the
pier
and
was
fairly
started
en
her
journey
from
new
york
to
liverpool
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
stood
a
group
of
five
persons
three
of
whom
had
given
utterance
to
the
exclamations
recorded
above
on
the
pier
swarmed
a
group
of
yale
students
waving
hands
hats
handkerchiefs
bidding
farewell
to
their
five
friends
and
acquaintances
on
the
steamer
over
the
water
came
the
familiar
yale
cheer
from
the
steamer
it
was
answered
in
the
midst
of
the
group
on
deck
was
frank
merriwell
those
around
him
were
bruce
browning
jack
diamond
harry
rattleton
and
tutor
wellington
maybe
it
was
frank
scheme
to
spend
the
summer
months
abroad
while
studying
in
the
attempt
to
catch
up
with
his
class
and
pass
examinations
on
college
in
the
fall
and
he
had
brought
along
his
three
friends
browning
diamond
and
rattleton
they
were
on
their
way
to
england
frank
was
happy
fortune
had
dealt
him
a
heavy
blow
when
he
was
compelled
by
poverty
to
leave
dear
old
yale
but
he
had
faced
the
world
bravely
and
he
had
struggled
like
a
man
hard
work
long
hours
and
poor
pay
had
not
daunted
him
at
the
very
start
he
had
shown
that
he
possessed
something
more
than
ordinary
ability
and
while
working
on
the
railroad
he
had
forced
his
way
upward
step
by
step
till
it
seemed
that
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
reach
the
top
of
the
ladder
then
came
disaster
again
he
had
lost
his
position
on
the
railroad
and
once
more
he
was
forced
to
face
the
world
and
begin
over
some
lads
would
have
been
discouraged
frank
merriwell
was
not
he
set
his
teeth
firmly
and
struck
out
once
more
he
kept
his
mouth
shut
and
his
eyes
open
the
first
honorable
thing
that
came
to
his
hand
to
do
he
did
thus
it
happened
that
he
found
himself
on
the
stage
frank
success
as
an
actor
had
been
phenomenal
of
course
to
begin
with
he
had
natural
ability
but
that
was
not
the
only
thing
that
won
success
for
him
he
had
courage
push
determination
when
he
started
to
do
a
thing
he
kept
at
it
till
he
did
it
frank
united
observation
and
study
he
learned
everything
he
could
about
the
stage
and
about
acting
by
talking
with
the
members
of
the
company
and
by
watching
to
see
how
things
were
done
he
had
a
good
head
and
plenty
of
sense
he
knew
better
than
to
copy
after
the
ordinary
actors
in
the
road
company
to
which
he
belonged
he
had
seen
good
acting
enough
to
be
able
to
distinguish
between
the
good
and
bad
thus
it
came
about
that
the
bad
models
about
him
did
not
exert
a
pernicious
influence
upon
him
frank
believed
there
were
books
that
would
aid
him
he
found
them
he
found
one
on
acting
and
actors
and
from
it
he
learned
that
no
actor
ever
becomes
really
and
truly
great
that
does
not
have
a
clear
and
distinct
enunciation
and
a
correct
pronunciation
that
is
the
beginning
then
comes
the
study
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
to
be
spoken
and
the
effect
produced
by
the
manner
in
which
they
are
spoken
he
studied
all
this
and
he
went
further
he
read
up
on
traditions
of
the
stage
and
he
came
to
know
all
about
its
limitations
and
its
opportunities
from
this
it
was
a
natural
step
to
the
study
of
the
construction
of
plays
he
found
books
of
criticism
on
plays
and
playwriting
and
he
mastered
them
he
found
books
that
told
how
to
construct
plays
and
he
mastered
them
frank
merriwell
was
a
person
with
a
vivid
imagination
and
great
mechanical
and
constructive
ability
had
this
not
been
so
he
might
have
studied
forever
and
still
never
been
able
to
write
a
successful
play
in
him
there
was
something
study
could
not
give
but
study
and
effort
brought
it
out
he
wrote
a
play
john
smith
of
montana
was
a
success
frank
played
the
leading
part
and
he
made
a
hit
then
fate
rose
up
and
again
dealt
him
a
body
blow
a
scene
in
the
play
was
almost
exactly
like
a
scene
in
another
play
written
previously
the
author
and
owner
of
the
other
play
called
on
the
law
to
protect
him
an
injunction
was
served
on
merry
to
restrain
him
from
playing
john
smith
he
stood
face
to
face
with
a
lawsuit
frank
investigated
and
his
investigation
convinced
him
that
it
was
almost
certain
he
would
be
defeated
if
the
case
was
carried
into
the
courts
he
withdrew
john
smith
frank
had
confidence
in
himself
he
had
written
a
play
that
was
successful
and
he
believed
he
could
write
another
already
he
had
one
skeletonized
the
frame
work
was
constructed
the
plot
was
elaborated
the
characters
were
ready
for
his
use
he
wrote
a
play
of
something
with
which
he
was
thoroughly
familiar
life
the
author
or
of
ability
who
writes
of
that
with
which
he
is
familiar
stands
a
good
chance
of
making
a
success
young
and
inexperienced
writers
love
to
write
of
those
things
with
which
they
are
unfamiliar
and
they
wonder
why
it
is
that
they
fail
they
go
too
far
away
from
home
for
their
subject
at
first
frank
play
was
not
a
success
the
moment
he
discovered
this
he
set
himself
down
to
find
out
why
it
was
not
a
success
he
did
not
look
at
it
as
the
author
but
as
a
critical
manager
to
whom
it
had
been
offered
might
have
done
he
found
the
weak
spots
one
was
its
name
people
in
general
did
not
understand
the
title
for
old
eli
there
was
nothing
catchy
or
drawing
about
it
he
gave
it
another
name
he
called
it
true
blue
a
drama
of
college
life
the
name
proved
effective
he
rewrote
much
of
the
play
he
strengthened
the
climax
of
the
third
act
and
introduced
a
mechanical
effect
that
was
very
ingenious
and
when
the
piece
next
went
on
the
road
it
met
with
wonderful
success
everywhere
thus
frank
snatched
success
from
defeat
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
when
a
person
fights
against
fate
and
conquers
when
fortune
begins
to
smile
when
the
tide
fairly
turns
his
way
then
everything
seems
to
come
to
him
the
things
which
seemed
so
far
away
and
so
impossible
of
attainment
suddenly
appear
within
easy
reach
or
come
tumbling
into
his
lap
of
their
own
accord
it
was
much
this
way
with
frank
he
had
dreamed
of
going
back
to
college
some
time
but
that
time
had
seemed
far
far
away
success
brought
it
nearer
but
then
it
came
tumbling
into
his
lap
no
one
had
been
found
to
claim
the
fortune
he
discovered
in
the
utah
desert
investigation
had
shown
that
there
were
no
living
relatives
of
the
man
who
had
guarded
the
treasure
till
his
death
that
treasure
had
been
turned
over
to
frank
frank
had
brought
his
play
to
new
haven
and
his
old
college
friends
had
given
him
a
rousing
welcome
and
now
he
had
made
plans
to
return
to
college
in
the
fall
while
his
play
was
to
be
carried
on
the
road
by
a
and
experienced
theatrical
manager
the
friends
who
had
been
with
frank
when
he
discovered
the
treasure
with
the
exception
of
toots
the
colored
boy
had
refused
to
accept
shares
of
the
fortune
then
merry
had
insisted
on
taking
them
abroad
with
him
and
here
they
were
on
the
steamer
eagle
bound
for
liverpool
toots
dressed
like
a
swell
was
on
the
pier
he
shouted
with
the
others
waving
his
silk
hat
the
crowd
was
cheering

me
what

frank
turned
quickly
and
saw
the
speaker
standing
near
the
rail
not
far
away
he
was
a
man
between
and
forty
years
of
age
dressed
in
a
traveling
suit
and
having
a
pointed
black
beard
he
was
smoking
an
instant
feeling
of
aversion
swept
over
merry
he
saw
the
person
was
a
supercilious
frenchman
critical
sneering
insolent
a
man
intolerant
with
everything
not
of
france
and
the
french
this
man
was
speaking
to
another
person
who
seemed
to
be
a
servant
or
valet
and
who
was
very
polite
and
fawning
in
all
his
retorts
ah
look
at

continued
the
sneering
speaker

monsieur
said
frank
with
a
grim
smile
that
they
are
copying
their
manners
after
frenchmen
at
a
dreyfus
demonstration
the
foreigner
turned
haughtily
and
stared
at
frank
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
turned
away
and
observed
to
his
companion
jes
like
all
ze
americans
ah
what
eez
ze
word
fresh
the
other
man
bowed
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
haw
grunted
browning
lazily
how
do
you
like
that
frank
oh
i
do
mind
it
murmured
merry
i
consider
the
source
from
which
it
came
and
regard
it
as
of
no
consequence
diamond
was
glaring
at
the
frenchman
for
it
made
his
hot
southern
blood
boil
to
hear
a
foreigner
criticize
anything
american
like
all
youthful
americans
his
great
admiration
and
love
for
his
own
country
made
him
intolerant
of
criticism
frank
had
a
cooler
head
and
he
was
not
so
easily
ruffled
rattleton
was
unable
to
express
his
feelings
tutor
maybe
looked
somewhat
perturbed
for
he
was
an
exceedingly
mild
and
peaceable
man
and
the
slightest
suggestion
of
trouble
was
enough
to
agitate
him
but
the
frenchman
did
not
deign
to
look
toward
frank
again
and
it
seemed
that
all
danger
of
trouble
was
past
the
eagle
sailed
slowly
down
the
harbor
signaling
now
and
then
to
other
boats
frank
jack
bruce
and
harry
formed
a
fine
quartette
and
they
sang
soon
we

london

sing
my

yo
heave
my
lads
ho
and
see
the
queen
with
her
golden
crown
heave

the
frenchman
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
showed
annoyance
which
caused
frank
to
laugh
behind
them
brooklyn

in
the

harry

could

the
frenchman

ovareboard
oui
monsieur
quick
as
thought
the
man
sprang
toward
harry
as
if
determined
to
execute
the
command
of
his
master
he
did
not
put
his
hands
on
rattleton
for
frank
was
equally
swift
in
his
movements
and
blocked
the
fellows
way
coolly
saying
i
would
try
it
if
i
were
you
out
of

snarled
the
man
who
was
an
athlete
in

if
you
do

put

i
do
think
you
will
put

maurel
ordered
the
frenchman
with
deadly
coolness
the
athletic
servant
clutched
frank
but
with
a
twist
and
a
turn
merry
broke
the
hold
instantly
kicked
the
fellow
feet
from
beneath
him
and
dropped
him
heavily
to
the
deck
bruce
browning
stooped
and
picked
the
man
up
as
if
he
were
an
infant
every
year
seemed
to
add
something
to
the
big
collegian
wonderful
strength
and
now
the
astounded
frenchman
found
himself
unable
to
wiggle
browning
held
the
man
over
the
rail
turning
to
frank
to
ask
shall
i
give
him
a
bath
merriwell
i
think
you
had
better
laughed
frank
perhaps
he
ca
swim
and
he
can
swim
or
sink
drawled
bruce
it
wo
make
any
difference
if
he
sinks
only
another
insolent
frenchman
out
of
the
way
the
master
was
astounded
up
to
that
moment
he
had
regarded
the
young
americans
as
scarcely
more
than
boys
and
he
had
fancied
his
athletic
servant
could
easily
frighten
them
instead
of
that
something
quite
unexpected
by
him
had
happened
the
astounded
servant
showed
signs
of
terror
but
in
vain
he
struggled
he
was
helpless
in
the
clutch
of
the
giant
collegian
the
master
seemed
about
to
interfere
but
frank
merriwell
confronted
him
in
a
manner
that
spoke
as
plainly
as
words
out
of
ze
way
snarled
the
man
speaking
to
me
inquired
merry
lifting
his
eyebrows
oui
oui
i
am
sorry
but
i
ca
accommodate
you
till
my
friend
gets
through
with
your
servant
who
was
extremely
fresh
like
most
frenchmen
zis
to
me
yes
sare
i
am
rouen
montfort
an
i
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
if
you
are
the
high
mogul
of
france
you
are
on
the
deck
of
an
english
vessel
and
you
are
dealing
with
americans
the
frenchman
flung
his
cigar
aside
and
seemed
to
feel
for
a
weapon
frank
stood
there
quietly
his
eyes
watching
every
movement
if
you
have
what
you
are
seeking
about
your
person
he
said
with
perfect
calmness
i
advise
you
not
to
draw
it
if
you
do
as
sure
as
you
are
sailing
down
new
york
harbor
i
fling
you
over
the
rail
weapon
and
all
that
was
business
and
it
was
not
boasting
frank
actually
meant
to
throw
the
man
into
the
water
if
he
drew
a
weapon
rouen
montfort
paused
and
stared
at
frank
merriwell
beginning
to
understand
that
he
was
not
dealing
with
an
ordinary
youth
fool
he
panted
you

bruce

the
fellow
down
if
he
minds
his
business
in
the
future
do
throw
him
overboard
all
right
grunted
the
big
fellow
but
i
was
just
going
to
drop
him
in
the
wet
he
put
the
man
down
and
the
fellow
seemed
undecided
what
to
do
harry
rattleton
laughed
now
wake
a
talk
no
i
mean
take
a
walk
he
cried
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
your
health
come
maurel
said
the
master
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
come
away
from
ze
fellows
maurel
was
glad
enough
to
do
so
he
had
thought
to
frighten
the
youths
without
the
least
trouble
but
had
been
handled
with
such
ease
that
even
after
it
was
all
over
he
wondered
how
it
could
have
happened
montfort
walked
away
with
great
dignity
and
maurel
followed
talking
savagely
and
swiftly
in
french
well
it
was
very
hard
to
settle
them
grinned
browning
but
we
have
not
settled
them
declared
frank
there
will
be
further
trouble
with
rouen
montfort
and
his
man

a
fresh
young
man
frank
and
his
three
friends
bad
a
stateroom
together
the
tutor
was
given
a
room
with
other
parties
the
weather
for
the
first
two
days
was
fine
and
the
young
collegians
enjoyed
every
minute
not
one
of
them
having
a
touch
of
till
the
third
day
then
rattleton
was
seized
and
he
lay
in
his
bunk
groaning
and
dismal
even
though
he
tried
to
be
cheerful
at
times
browning
enjoyed
everything
even
rattleton
misery
for
he
could
be
lazy
to
his
heart
content
they
had
enlivened
the
times
by
singing
songs
those
of
a
nautical
flavor
such
as
larboard
watch
and
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
having
the
preference
now
it
happened
that
the
frenchman
occupied
a
room
adjoining
and
he
was
very
much
annoyed
by
their
singing
he
pounded
on
the
partition
and
expressed
his
feelings
in
very
lurid
language
but
that
amused
them
and
they
sang
the
louder
montfort
seems
to
get
very
agitated
said
frank
laughing
but
i
hardly
think
there
is
any
danger
that
he
will
do
more
than
hammer
on
the
partition
grunted
bruce
he
kept
away
from
us
since
he
found
he
could
not
frighten
anybody
he
a
bluffer
was
diamond
opinion
he
a
great
fellow
to
play
cards
said
merry
but
he
seems
to
ply
for
something
more
than
amusement
how
that
asked
jack
interested
i
noticed
that
he
never
cares
for
whist
or
any
game
where
there
are
no
stakes
he
gets
into
a
game
only
when
there
something
to
be
won
well
it
seems
to
me
that
he
struck
a
poor
crowd
on
this
boat
if
looking
for
suckers
he
should
have
shipped
on
an
ocean
liner
what
does
he
play
he
seems
to
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
draw
poker
is
what
he
calls
it
he
pretended
at
first
that
he
did
know
much
of
anything
about
the
game
but
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
an
old
stager
at
it
i
watched
the
party
playing
in
the
last
night
who
played
asked
bruce
the
frenchman
a
rather
sporty
young
fellow
named
bloodgood
a
small
bespectacled
man
well
fitted
with
the
name
of
slush
and
an
englishman
by
the
name
of
hazleton
that
the
crowd
that
played
in
the
frenchman
stateroom
groaned
rattleton
from
his
berth
played
in
the
stateroom
exclaimed
frank
i
wonder
why
they
play
in
the
do
know
said
harry
but
i
fancy
there
was
a
rather
big
game
on
and
you
know
the
frenchman
has
the
biggest
stateroom
on
the
boat
so
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
them
they
could
play
there
without
interruption
there
seems
to
be
something
mysterious
about
that
frenchman
said
frank
i
think
there
something
mysterious
about
several
passengers
on
this
boat
grunted
browning
i
have
seen
much
of
this
young
fellow
bloodgood
but
he
strikes
me
as
a
mystery
why
well
he
seems
to
have
money
to
burn
and
i
do
understand
why
such
a
fellow
did
not
take
passage
on
a
regular
liner
as
far
as
that
goes
smiled
merry
i
presume
some
people
might
think
it
rather
singular
that
we
did
not
cross
the
pond
in
a
regular
liner
but
then
they
might
suppose
it
was
a
case
of
economy
with
us
while
they
were
talking
there
came
a
rap
on
their
door
which
frank
threw
open
just
outside
stood
a
young
man
with
a
flushed
face
and
distressed
appearance
he
was
dressed
in
a
plaid
suit
and
wore
a
red
necktie
in
which
blazed
a
huge
diamond
there
were
two
large
solitaire
rings
on
his
left
hand
and
he
wore
a
heavy
gold
chain
strung
across
his
vest
beg
your
pardon
dear
boys
he
drawled
hope
i
not
intruding
then
he
walked
in
and
closed
the
door
my
name
bloodgood
he
said
raymond
bloodgood
i
seen
you
fellows
together
and
you
seem
like
a
jolly
lot
heard
you
singing
you
know
great
voices
good
singing
then
he
stopped
speaking
and
they
stared
at
him
wondering
what
he
was
driving
at
for
a
moment
there
was
an
awkward
pause
and
then
bloodgood
went
on
i
was
up
pretty
late
last
night
you
know
had
a
little
game
in
the
plenty
of
booze
and
all
that
and
i
awfully
rocky
got
a
splitting
headache
did
know
but
some
of
you
had
a
bromo
seltzer
or
something
of
the
sort
you
look
like
a
crowd
that
finds
such
things
handy
occasionally
at
this
frank
laughed
quietly
but
diamond
looked
angry
and
indignant
what
do
you
take
us
for
exclaimed
the
virginian
warmly
do
you
think
we
are
a
lot
of
boozers
bloodgood
turned
on
jack
lifting
his
eyebrows
my
dear
fellow
he
began
but
frank
put
in
we
have
no
use
for
bromo
seltzer
as
none
of
us
are
drinkers
oh
of
course
not
said
the
intruder
with
something
like
a
sneer
none
of
us
are
drinkers
but
then
we
all
liable
to
get
a
little
too
much
sometimes
especially
when
we
sit
up
late
and
play
poker
frank
saw
that
diamond
had
taken
an
instant
dislike
to
the
youth
with
the
diamonds
and
the
red
necktie
and
he
felt
like
averting
a
storm
even
though
he
did
not
fancy
the
manner
of
the
intruder
we
do
not
sit
up
late
and
play
poker
he
said
eh
oh
come
off
you
a
jolly
lot
of
fellows
and
you
must
have
a
fling
sometimes
we
can
be
jolly
without
drinking
or
gambling
why
i
hanged
if
you
do
talk
as
if
you
considered
it
a
crime
to
take
a
drink
or
have
a
little
social
game
frank
felt
his
blood
warm
up
a
bit
but
he
held
himself
in
hand
as
he
quietly
retorted
intemperance
is
a
crime
i
presume
there
are
men
who
take
a
drink
as
you
call
it
without
being
intemperate
but
i
prefer
to
let
the
stuff
alone
entirely
and
then
there
is
no
danger
of
going
over
the
limit
and
i
took
you
for
a
sport
that
shows
how
a
fellow
can
be
fooled
but
you
do
play
poker
occasionally
i
know
that
how
do
you
know
it
mr
bloodgood
by
your
language
you
just
spoke
of
going
over
the
limit
that
is
a
poker
term
and
one
used
by
many
people
who
never
played
a
game
of
cards
in
their
lives
but
you
have
played
cards
you
have
played
poker
can
you
deny
it
if
i
could
i
would
take
the
trouble
bloodgood
i
think
you
have
made
a
mistake
in
sizing
up
this
crowd
guess
i
have
sneered
the
fellow
you
must
be
members
of
the
say
frank
panted
jack
open
the
door
and
let
me
but
frank
checked
the
youth
again
steady
jack
it
is
not
necessary
he
will
go
directly
bloodgood
you
speak
as
if
it
were
a
disgrace
to
belong
to
the
that
shows
your
ignorance
and
narrowness
the
is
a
splendid
organization
and
it
has
proved
the
anchor
that
has
kept
many
a
young
man
from
dashing
onto
the
rocks
of
destruction
those
who
sneer
at
it
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
but
as
a
rule
they
are
too
bigoted
prejudiced
or
to
recognize
the
fact
that
some
of
the
most
manly
young
men
to
be
found
belong
to
the
bloodgood
laughed
and
i
took
you
for
a
sport
he
cried
by
jove
never
made
such
a
blunder
before
in
all
my
life
studying
for
the
ministry
i
wager
ha
ha
ha
frank
saw
that
diamond
could
not
be
held
in
check
much
longer
one
last
word
to
you
bloodgood
he
spoke
i
am
not
studying
for
the
ministry
and
i
do
not
even
belong
to
the
if
i
were
doing
the
one
or
belonged
to
the
other
i
should
not
be
ashamed
of
it
i
like
you
i
can
stand
a
little
freshness
in
fact
it
rather
pleases
me
but
you
are
altogether
too
fresh
you
are
offensive
merry
flung
open
the
door
sir
bloodgood
stepped
out
turned
round
laughed
and
then
walked
away
hang
it

grated
diamond
as
frank
closed
the
door
why
did
you
let
me
kick
him
out
onto
his
neck
chapter
iv
who
is
bloodgood
diamond
was
thoroughly
angry
so
was
rattleton
in
his
excitement
harry
said
something
that
caused
frank
to
turn
quickly
and
observe
do
use
that
kind
of
language
old
man
no
matter
what
the
provocation
vulgarity
is
even
lower
than
profanity
harry
face
flushed
and
he
looked
intensely
ashamed
of
himself
i
peg
your
bardon
i
mean
i
beg
your
pardon
he
spluttered
it
slipped
out
you
know
i
do
say
anything
like
that
often
i
know
it
nodded
frank
and
that
why
it
sounded
all
the
worse
i
do
know
that
i
ever
heard
you
use
such
a
word
before
harry
did
not
resent
frank
reproof
for
he
knew
frank
was
right
and
he
was
ashamed
every
young
man
who
stoops
to
vulgarity
should
be
ashamed
profanity
is
coarse
and
degrading
vulgarity
is
positively
low
and
filthy
the
youth
who
is
careful
to
keep
his
clothes
and
his
body
clean
should
be
careful
to
keep
his
mouth
clean
let
nothing
go
into
it
or
come
out
of
it
that
is
in
any
way
lowering
did
you
ever
hear
a
loafer
on
a
corner
using
profane
and
obscene
language
i
warrant
most
of
you
have
and
i
warrant
that
you
were
thoroughly
disgusted
you
looked
on
the
fellow
as
low
coarse
cheap
unfit
to
associate
with
respectable
persons
the
next
time
you
use
a
word
that
you
should
be
ashamed
to
have
your
mother
or
sister
hear
just
think
that
you
are
following
the
example
of
that
loafer
you
are
lowering
yourself
in
the
eyes
of
somebody
even
though
you
may
not
think
so
at
the
time
perhaps
one
of
your
companions
may
be
a
person
who
uses
such
language
freely
and
yet
he
has
never
before
heard
it
from
you
he
laughs
he
calls
you
a
jolly
good
fellow
to
your
face
but
he
thinks
to
himself
that
you
are
no
better
than
anybody
else
and
behind
your
back
he
tells
somebody
what
he
thinks
he
is
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
show
that
you
are
no
better
than
he
is
never
tell
a
vulgar
story
better
never
listen
to
one
unless
your
position
is
such
that
you
can
not
escape
without
making
yourself
appear
a
positive
cad
if
you
have
to
listen
to
such
a
story
forget
it
as
soon
as
possible
above
all
things
do
not
try
to
remember
it
some
young
men
boast
of
the
stories
they
know
and
all
their
stories
are
of
the
shady
sort
it
is
better
to
know
no
stories
than
to
know
that
kind
it
is
better
not
to
be
called
a
good
fellow
than
to
win
a
reputation
by
always
having
a
new
story
of
the
low
sort
ready
on
your
tongue
there
are
other
and
better
ways
of
winning
a
reputation
as
a
good
fellow
there
are
stories
which
are
genuinely
humorous
and
funny
which
are
also
clean
no
matter
how
much
of
a
laugh
he
may
raise
any
person
feels
that
he
has
lowered
himself
by
telling
a
vulgar
story
it
is
not
so
if
he
has
told
a
clean
story
he
is
satisfied
with
the
laughter
he
has
caused
and
with
himself
frank
merriwell
was
called
a
good
fellow
it
was
not
often
that
he
told
a
story
but
when
he
did
it
was
a
good
one
and
it
was
clean
he
had
an
inimitable
way
of
telling
anything
and
his
stories
were
all
the
more
effective
because
they
came
at
rare
intervals
he
did
not
cheapen
them
by
making
them
common
and
never
had
anybody
heard
him
tell
a
story
that
could
prove
offensive
to
the
ears
of
a
lady
not
that
he
had
not
been
tempted
to
do
so
not
that
he
had
not
heard
such
stories
he
had
been
placed
in
positions
where
he
could
not
help
hearing
them
without
making
himself
appear
like
a
thorough
cad
frank
first
attempt
to
tell
a
vulgar
story
had
been
the
lesson
that
he
needed
he
was
with
a
rather
gay
crowd
of
boys
at
the
time
and
several
had
told
shady
yarns
and
then
they
had
called
for
one
from
frank
he
started
to
tell
one
working
up
to
the
point
with
all
the
skill
of
which
he
was
capable
he
had
them
breathless
ready
to
shout
with
laughter
when
the
point
was
reached
he
drew
them
on
and
on
with
all
the
skill
of
which
he
was
capable
and
then
just
as
the
climax
was
reached
he
suddenly
realized
just
what
he
was
about
to
say
a
thought
came
to
him
that
made
his
heart
give
a
great
jump
what
if
my
mother
were
listening
that
was
the
thought
his
mother
was
dead
but
her
influence
was
over
him
a
second
thought
followed
many
times
he
had
seemed
to
feel
her
hovering
near
perhaps
she
was
listening
perhaps
she
was
hearing
all
that
he
was
saying
frank
merriwell
stopped
and
stood
quite
still
at
first
he
was
very
pale
and
then
came
a
rush
of
blood
to
his
face
he
turned
crimson
with
shame
and
hung
his
head
his
companions
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
they
could
not
understand
what
had
happened
some
of
them
cried
go
on
go
on
after
some
seconds
he
tried
to
speak
at
first
he
choked
and
could
say
nothing
articulate
after
a
little
he
muttered
i
ca
go
on
i
ca
finish
the
story
you
have
to
excuse
me
fellows
i
not
feeling
well
and
he
withdrew
from
the
jolly
party
as
soon
as
possible
from
that
day
frank
merriwell
never
attempted
to
tell
a
story
that
was
in
the
slightest
degree
vulgar
he
had
learned
his
lesson
and
he
never
forgot
it
some
boys
swagger
chew
tobacco
talk
vulgar
and
swear
because
they
do
not
wish
to
be
called
sissies
they
fancy
such
actions
and
language
make
them
manly
but
nothing
could
be
a
greater
mistake
frank
did
nothing
of
the
sort
and
all
who
knew
him
regarded
him
as
thoroughly
manly
better
to
be
called
a
sissy
than
to
win
reputed
manliness
at
the
cost
of
frank
had
forced
those
who
would
have
regarded
him
with
scorn
to
respect
him
he
could
play
baseball
or
football
with
the
best
of
them
he
could
run
jump
swim
ride
and
he
excelled
by
sheer
determination
in
almost
everything
he
undertook
he
would
not
be
beaten
if
defeated
once
he
did
not
rest
but
prepared
himself
for
another
trial
and
went
in
to
win
or
die
in
this
way
he
showed
himself
manly
and
he
commanded
the
respect
of
enemies
as
well
as
friends
rattleton
was
ashamed
of
the
language
he
had
used
after
the
departure
of
bloodgood
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
excuse
himself
further
he
lay
back
in
his
berth
looking
sicker
than
ever
i
give
ten
dollars
for
the
privilege
of
helping
bloodgood
out
with
my
foot
hissed
jack
diamond
never
saw
anybody
so
fresh
oh
i
seen
lots
of
people
just
like
him
grunted
browning
getting
out
a
pipe
and
lighting
it
do
smoke
bruce
groaned
rattleton
as
the
steamer
gave
an
unusually
heavy
roll
i
sick
enough
now
that
will
make
me
worse
oh
we
open
the
port
open
the
port
laughed
frank
and
we
just
told
bloodgood
we
did
not
drink
not
port
wine
said
the
big
fellow
with
a
yawn
we
let
in
some
fresh
air
we
ca
let
in
anything
fresher
than
just
went
out
declared
the
virginian
as
he
flung
open
the
round
window
that
served
to
admit
light
and
air
there
something
mighty
queer
about
that
fellow
said
frank
did
you
notice
the
diamonds
he
was
wearing
fellows
yes
said
bruce
beginning
to
puff
away
at
his
new
briarwood
regular
they
were
who
knows
they
were
genuine
asked
jack
nobody
here
admitted
frank
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
some
fake
stones
from
real
diamonds
unless
you
examine
them
closely
but
somehow
i
have
a
fancy
that
those
were
genuine
diamonds
what
makes
you
think
so
i
do
know
just
why
i
think
so
but
i
do
something
tells
me
that
for
all
of
his
swagger
bloodgood
is
a
fellow
who
would
scorn
to
wear
paste
diamonds
what
do
you
make
out
of
the
fellow
anyway
asked
bruce
i
not
able
to
size
him
up
yet
admitted
frank
i
not
certain
whether
he
came
of
a
good
family
or
a
bad
one
but
i
inclined
to
fancy
it
was
the
former
i
like
to
know
why
you
think
so
from
jack
he
did
not
show
very
good
breeding
but
there
is
a
certain
something
about
his
face
that
makes
me
believe
he
comes
from
a
family
i
think
he
has
become
lowered
by
associating
with
bad
companions
well
i
do
care
who
or
what
he
is
declared
jack
if
he
gets
fresh
around
me
again
i
crack
him
one
for
luck
i
ca
stand
him
for
a
cent
better
turn
him
over
to
me
murmured
bruce
dozily
i
sit
on
him
and
he
think
he
under
an
elephant
laughed
merry
bruce
cooked
montfort
and
i
reckon
he
have
less
trouble
to
cook
mr
bloodgood
at
this
moment
there
was
a
hesitating
uncertain
knock
on
the
door
another
visitor
i
wonder
muttered
frank
chapter
the
superstitious
man
a
little
man
hesitated
outside
the
door
when
it
was
opened
he
had
a
sad
uncertain
mournful
drab
face
puckered
into
a
peculiar
expression
about
the
mouth
he
was
dressed
in
black
but
his
clothes
were
not
a
very
good
fit
or
in
the
latest
style
he
fingered
his
hat
nervously
his
voice
was
faltering
when
he
spoke
i
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
i
i
hope
i
am
not
intruding
he
had
not
crossed
the
threshold
he
seemed
in
doubt
about
the
advisability
of
venturing
in
there
was
something
amusing
in
the
appearance
of
the
little
man
frank
recognized
a
character
in
him
and
merry
was
interested
immediately
he
invited
the
little
man
in
and
closed
the
door
when
that
person
had
entered
i
i
know
it
rather
rather
er
bold
of
me
said
the
stranger
apologetically
but
you
know
people
on
shipboard
er
take
many
liberties
oh
yes
we
know
it
muttered
diamond
browning
grunted
and
looked
the
little
man
over
he
was
a
curiosity
to
bruce
what
can
we
do
for
you
sir
asked
frank
the
little
man
hesitated
and
looked
around
he
sidled
over
and
put
his
hand
on
the
partition
the
ah
next
room
is
occupied
by
the
er
the
french
gentleman
is
it
not
he
asked
yes
sir
i
i
presume
presume
you
know
that
you
are
able
to
hear
any
ah
conversation
that
may
take
place
in
that
room
unless
er
the
conversation
is
guarded
not
unless
we
take
particular
pains
to
listen
said
merry
even
then
it
is
doubtful
if
we
can
hear
anything
plainly
and
we
are
not
eavesdroppers
cut
in
diamond
we
do
not
take
pains
to
listen
oh
no
er
no
of
course
not
exclaimed
the
singular
stranger
i
i
did
insinuate
such
a
thing
ha
ha
ha
the
idea
but
you
know
sometimes
occasionally
persons
hear
things
when
they
er
do
not
try
to
hear
well
what
in
the
world
are
you
driving
at
asked
frank
not
a
little
puzzled
by
the
man
singular
manner
well
you
see
it
this
way
i
i
do
care
to
be
overheard
i
do
want
anybody
to
to
think
i
prying
into
their
private
business
you
understand
i
ca
say
that
i
do
perhaps
i
can
make
myself
er
clearer
perhaps
you
can
my
name
is
er
slush
peddington
slush
holy
cats
what
a
name
muttered
browning
while
rattleton
grinned
despite
his
sickness
i
i
taking
a
sea
voyage
for
for
my
health
explained
slush
that
why
i
did
go
over
on
a
a
regular
liner
this
way
i
shall
be
longer
at
at
sea
see
and
you
are
keeping
us
at
sea
by
your
lingering
way
in
coming
to
a
point
smiled
merry
eh
said
the
little
man
then
he
seemed
to
comprehend
and
he
broke
into
a
sudden
cackle
of
laughter
which
he
shut
off
with
startling
suddenness
looking
frightened
beg
your
pardon
he
exclaimed
quite
ah
rude
of
me
i
do
do
it
often
you
look
as
if
it
would
hurt
you
to
do
it
oftener
said
merry
frankly
laughter
never
hurt
anyone
i
i
ca
quite
agree
with
you
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
no
offense
i
i
do
wish
to
be
offensive
you
understand
i
once
knew
a
man
who
died
from
er
laughing
it
is
a
fact
sir
he
laughed
so
long
and
so
hard
he
he
lost
his
breath
entirely
never
got
it
back
again
since
then
i
been
very
cautious
it
a
bad
sign
to
laugh
too
hard
merry
felt
like
shouting
but
jack
was
looking
puzzled
and
dazed
diamond
could
not
comprehend
the
little
man
and
he
failed
to
catch
the
humor
of
the
character
now
said
slush
i
will
come
directly
to
the
point
do
nodded
frank
i
just
saw
a
er
person
leave
this
room
i
wish
to
know
if
good
gracious
sir
do
you
know
that
is
a
bad
sign
he
pointed
a
wavering
finger
at
frank
what
is
a
bad
sign
asked
merry
surprised
to
wear
a
a
dagger
pin
thrust
through
a
a
tie
in
which
there
is
the
least
bit
of
red
it
is
a
sign
of
of
bloodshed
i
i
beg
you
to
remove
that
that
pin
from
that
scarf
the
little
man
seemed
greatly
agitated
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
frank
laughed
lightly
and
took
the
pin
from
the
scarf
immediately
the
visitor
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
ah
er
thank
you
he
said
i
i
seen
omens
enough
everything
seems
to
point
to
to
a
tragedy
i
regret
exceedingly
that
i
ever
sailed
on
this
steamer
i
i
shall
be
thankful
when
i
put
my
feet
on
dry
land
if
i
ever
do
again
you
must
be
rather
superstitious
suggested
frank
not
at
all
that
is
not
to
any
extent
slush
hastened
to
aver
there
are
a
few
signs
and
omens
which
i
know
will
come
true
indeed
yes
sir
asserted
the
little
man
with
surprising
positiveness
i
know
something
will
happen
to
this
boat
i
i
am
positive
of
it
why
are
you
so
positive
everything
foretells
it
at
the
very
start
it
was
foretold
i
was
foolish
then
that
i
did
not
demand
demand
sir
to
be
set
ashore
even
after
the
steamer
had
left
her
pier
how
was
that
there
was
a
cat
sir
a
poor
stray
cat
that
came
aboard
this
steamer
they
did
not
let
her
stay
understand
me
they
they
drove
her
off
and
that
was
a
bad
omen
bad
it
was
ah
er
frightful
old
sailors
will
tell
you
that
always
er
let
a
cat
remain
on
board
a
vessel
if
she
comes
on
board
if
you
if
you
do
not
you
will
regret
it
and
you
think
something
must
happen
to
this
steamer
i
afraid
so
i
feel
it
there
is
something
mysterious
about
the
vessel
gentlemen
i
do
know
just
what
it
is
but
it
something
the
the
captain
looks
worried
i
i
noticed
it
i
talked
with
him
could
get
any
satisfaction
out
of
him
but
i
i
know
i
afraid
you
are
a
croaker
said
diamond
unable
to
keep
still
longer
you
may
think
so
now
but
wait
and
see
wait
keep
your
eyes
open
i
i
think
you
will
see
something
i
think
you
will
find
there
are
mysterious
things
going
on
well
you
have
not
told
us
what
you
want
of
us
slush
said
frank
that
so
forgot
it
then
of
a
sudden
to
bruce
do
twirl
your
thumbs
that
way
do
it
backward
backward
it
it
a
sure
sign
of
disaster
to
twirl
your
thumbs
forward
all
right
grunted
the
big
fellow
backward
it
is
and
he
reversed
the
motion
thank
you
breathed
slush
with
a
show
of
relief
now
i
tell
you
why
i
called
i
er
saw
a
young
man
leaving
this
room
a
few
minutes
ago
yes
mr
bloodgood
yes
i
i
have
taken
an
interest
in
bloodgood
i
i
think
he
is
a
rather
nice
young
man
i
do
admire
your
taste
came
from
jack
eh
i
do
know
him
very
well
you
understand
met
him
in
the
sometimes
i
er
play
cards
for
amusement
met
him
that
way
does
he
play
for
amusement
asked
frank
oh
yes
ah
of
course
that
is
he
he
likes
a
little
stake
i
thought
so
i
i
do
mind
that
great
scott
thought
merry
i
do
see
how
he
ever
gets
round
to
play
cards
for
money
i
should
think
he
know
what
to
do
it
would
take
him
so
long
to
make
up
his
mind
but
i
i
do
care
to
make
a
a
companion
of
anybody
about
whom
i
know
nothing
that
why
i
came
to
you
i
i
thought
it
might
be
you
could
give
me
some
information
about
mr
bloodgood
you
come
to
the
wrong
place
really
do
you
know
anything
about
him
you
are
er
well
acquainted
with
him
on
the
contrary
is
the
first
time
we
have
ever
spoken
to
him
is
that
so
said
slush
in
evident
disappointment
you
are
er
young
men
about
about
his
age
and
and
not
in
his
class
put
in
diamond
no
said
slush
looking
at
jack
queerly
i
did
know
i
thought
there
the
queer
little
man
stopped
seeming
quite
unable
to
proceed
then
in
his
hesitating
uncertain
way
he
tried
to
make
it
clear
that
he
did
not
care
to
play
cards
for
money
with
anybody
about
whom
he
knew
nothing
he
was
not
very
effective
in
his
explanation
and
seemed
himself
rather
uncertain
concerning
his
real
reason
for
wishing
to
make
inquiries
concerning
bloodgood
frank
studied
slush
closely
but
could
not
take
the
measure
of
the
man
somehow
merry
seemed
to
feel
that
there
was
more
to
the
queer
little
fellow
than
appeared
on
the
surface
well
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
parties
to
get
information
about
bloodgood
said
frank
but
if
you
are
so
particular
about
your
company
it
might
be
well
to
learn
something
concerning
the
other
members
of
your
party
oh
er
i
know
all
about
them
asserted
slush
indeed
yes
hugh
hazleton
is
the
younger
son
of
an
english
nobleman
and
he
is
is
all
right
who
told
you
this
he
did
then
it
must
be
true
grunted
browning
with
a
grin
on
his
broad
face
yes
nodded
the
little
man
innocently
that
is
ah
settled
rouen
montfort
is
a
a
great
french
journalist
and
er
writer
of
books
is
that
so
smiled
merry
queer
i
never
heard
of
him
i
suppose
he
told
you
this
oh
yes
he
is
a
very
fine
gentleman
ah
did
bloodgood
invite
er
any
of
you
to
come
into
the
ah
game
frank
fancied
he
saw
a
sudden
light
was
it
possible
slush
was
looking
for
suckers
was
it
possible
he
had
been
sent
there
to
inveigle
them
into
the
party
so
that
some
sharp
might
skin
them
it
did
not
seem
improbable
harry
seemed
to
catch
onto
the
same
idea
for
he
popped
up
in
his
bunk
suddenly
but
a
sudden
roll
of
the
steamer
caused
him
to
sink
down
again
with
a
groan
diamond
eyes
began
to
glitter
he
too
fancied
he
saw
the
little
game
no
said
merry
slowly
he
did
not
invite
any
of
us
to
come
in
the
little
man
seemed
relieved
i
i
did
know
he
faltered
if
he
had
i
i
was
going
to
say
something
perhaps
it
is
not
necessary
perhaps
not
said
frank
but
it
may
not
do
any
hurt
to
say
it
and
it
may
do
some
hurt
to
you
muttered
diamond
under
his
breath
i
will
kick
this
fellow
but
to
the
surprise
of
all
the
superstitious
man
cackled
out
a
short
broken
laugh
and
said
oh
i
was
going
to
to
warn
you
that
all
it
it
liable
to
be
a
pretty
stiff
game
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
you
to
keep
out
of
it
it
started
light
but
it
working
up
right
along
almost
any
time
somebody
is
liable
to
to
propose
throwing
off
the
the
limit
and
then
somebody
is
going
to
get
hurt
if
you
are
not
in
it
why
you
wo
be
in
any
danger
there
was
a
silence
the
four
youths
looked
at
the
visitor
and
then
at
each
other
what
did
it
mean
if
he
was
playing
them
for
suckers
surely
he
was
doing
it
in
a
queer
manner
thank
you
said
frank
stiffly
you
are
kind
more
than
kind
muttered
diamond
do
mention
it
said
the
little
man
trying
to
look
pleasant
but
making
a
dismal
failure
i
i
dont
like
to
see
respectable
young
men
caught
in
a
trap
that
all
thought
i
tell
you
did
know
that
you
would
thank
me
took
my
chances
on
that
well
i
think
i
be
going
he
turned
falteringly
seemed
about
to
say
something
more
opened
the
door
part
way
hesitated
then
said
and
went
out
chapter
vi
the
cargo
of
the
eagle
well
well
well
the
same
word
but
from
three
different
persons
and
spoken
in
three
different
inflections
will
somebody
please
hit
me
with
something
hard
murmured
jack
what
does
it
mean
merry
asked
rattleton
you
may
search
me
exclaimed
frank
in
rather
expressive
slang
something
in
which
he
seldom
indulged
unless
under
great
provocation
browning
had
said
nothing
he
was
pulling
steadily
at
his
pipe
quite
unaware
that
it
had
gone
out
what
do
you
make
of
peddington
slush
asked
jack
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
him
confessed
frank
about
the
only
thing
of
which
i
am
sure
is
that
he
has
a
corker
for
a
name
that
name
is
enough
to
make
any
man
look
sad
and
dejected
what
did
he
come
here
for
anyhow
asked
rattleton
to
find
out
about
raymond
bloodgood
he
said
i
know
he
said
so
but
i
do
stake
any
talk
i
mean
take
any
stock
in
that
what
difference
does
it
make
to
him
who
bloodgood
is
that
was
something
he
did
not
make
clear
he
did
seem
to
make
anything
clear
declared
jack
i
thought
for
sure
that
he
was
going
to
throw
out
some
hooks
to
drag
us
into
that
game
of
poker
if
he
had
i
should
have
known
he
was
sent
here
and
kicked
him
out
whether
you
had
been
willing
or
not
merry
i
opened
the
door
and
held
it
wide
for
you
smiled
frank
what
do
you
think
of
him
browning
asked
harry
his
way
of
talking
made
me
very
tired
yawned
the
big
fellow
he
seemed
to
work
so
hard
to
get
anything
out
i
allow
that
we
have
had
two
rather
queer
visitors
said
the
virginian
and
i
shall
take
an
interest
in
them
both
after
this
declared
frank
talk
about
superstitious
persons
i
believe
he
heads
the
list
from
jack
he
said
he
was
not
superstitious
laughed
merry
but
the
cat
worried
him
and
my
twiddling
my
thumbs
put
in
bruce
and
this
dagger
pin
in
my
scarf
said
frank
it
a
wonder
he
did
prophecy
shipwreck
or
something
of
that
sort
groaned
rattleton
who
had
settled
at
full
length
in
his
berth
if
this
rolling
motion
keeps
up
i
shall
get
so
i
wo
care
if
we
are
wrecked
he
must
be
a
dandy
in
a
good
swift
game
of
poker
laughed
frank
i
should
think
he
be
able
to
make
up
his
mind
how
to
discard
he
be
a
drawback
to
the
game
or
i
much
mistaken
it
strikes
me
that
he
be
easy
fruit
said
rattleton
he
looks
like
a
himself
but
sometimes
it
is
impossible
to
tell
about
a
man
till
after
you
see
him
play
anyhow
these
two
visits
were
something
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
voyage
it
promised
to
be
pretty
lively
at
the
start
but
it
has
settled
down
to
be
rather
quiet
bloodgood
and
slush
proved
good
food
for
conversation
but
the
boys
tired
of
that
after
a
while
diamond
went
out
by
himself
and
frank
went
to
tutor
maybe
room
where
he
spent
the
time
till
the
gong
sounded
for
supper
come
harry
said
frank
appearing
in
the
stateroom
are
you
ready
for
supper
rattleton
gave
a
groan
do
talk
to
me
about
eating
he
exclaimed
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
about
it
leave
me
let
me
die
in
peace
jack
was
not
there
so
frank
and
bruce
washed
up
and
went
out
together
they
were
nearly
through
eating
when
the
virginian
came
in
and
took
his
place
near
them
at
the
table
usually
the
captain
sat
at
the
head
of
that
table
but
he
was
not
there
now
where
have
you
been
asked
frank
getting
onto
a
few
things
said
jack
in
a
peculiar
way
why
what
the
matter
with
you
asked
bruce
pausing
to
stare
at
the
southerner
you
are
pale
as
a
ghost
am
i
said
diamond
his
voice
sounding
rather
strained
and
unnatural
sure
thing
i
would
advise
you
to
eat
any
more
and
perhaps
you
had
better
look
at
the
chandeliers
while
they
are
swinging
you
be
keeping
rattleton
company
oh
i
not
sick
at
least
not
seasick
averred
jack
then
what
ails
you
i
was
going
to
prescribe
ginger
ale
if
it
was
the
first
stage
of
seasickness
sometimes
that
will
brace
a
person
up
and
straighten
out
his
stomach
oh
do
talk
remedies
to
me
i
took
medicine
three
days
before
i
started
on
this
voyage
and
everybody
i
saw
told
me
something
to
do
to
keep
from
being
sick
i
wearing
a
sheet
of
writing
paper
across
my
chest
now
when
supper
was
over
jack
motioned
for
his
friends
to
follow
him
the
three
went
on
deck
and
walked
aft
till
they
were
quite
alone
the
eagle
was
plowing
along
over
a
deserted
sea
the
waves
were
running
heavily
and
night
was
shutting
down
grimly
over
the
ocean
what
the
matter
with
you
diamond
asked
browning
why
have
you
dragged
us
out
here
it
cold
and
i
rather
go
into
our
stateroom
and
take
a
loaf
after
eating
so
heartily
by
jove
if
this
keeps
up
they
wo
have
provisions
enough
on
this
boat
to
feed
me
before
we
get
across
i
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
without
said
jack
and
i
did
care
about
talking
in
the
stateroom
where
i
might
be
overheard
what
up
anyway
demanded
frank
warned
by
the
manner
of
the
virginian
that
jack
fancied
he
had
something
of
importance
to
tell
them
i
been
investigating
said
jack
what
well
i
found
out
that
there
is
something
the
matter
on
this
boat
did
you
learn
what
it
was
i
do
know
that
i
have
but
i
discovered
one
thing
i
learned
the
kind
of
cargo
we
carry
what
is
it
petroleum
and
powder
chapter
vii
premonitions
of
peril
well
that
hot
stuff
when
it
burning
said
merriwell
grimly
rather
grunted
browning
if
i
known
what
the
old
boat
carried
i
think
i
hesitated
some
about
shipping
on
her
declared
jack
what
if
she
did
get
on
fire
we
all
go
up
in
smoke
said
merriwell
with
absolute
coolness
that
is
about
the
size
of
it
well
said
jack
i
heard
two
of
the
sailors
talking
in
a
very
mysterious
manner
they
say
the
is
hoodooed
and
the
captain
knows
it
they
say
he
has
not
slept
any
to
speak
of
since
we
left
new
york
sailors
are
always
superstitious
they
are
ignorant
as
a
rule
and
ignorance
breeds
superstition
do
you
consider
slush
ignorant
asked
bruce
did
have
time
to
size
him
up
but
he
queer
i
shall
feel
that
i
am
over
a
volcano
during
the
rest
of
the
voyage
said
jack
what
if
there
was
somebody
on
board
who
wished
to
destroy
the
ship
it
would
be
much
of
a
job
grunted
browning
a
match
touched
to
a
powder
keg
would
do
the
trick
in
a
hurry
but
he
go
up
with
the
rest
of
us
said
frank
unless
he
used
a
slow
match
put
in
jack
these
captains
always
have
their
enemies
who
are
desperate
fellows
and
ready
to
do
almost
anything
to
injure
them
the
steamer
might
be
set
afire
by
means
of
a
slow
match
which
would
give
the
villain
time
enough
to
get
away
i
hardly
think
there
anybody
desperate
enough
to
do
that
kind
of
a
trick
for
it
would
be
a
case
of
suicide
perhaps
not
the
chap
who
did
the
trick
might
have
some
plan
of
escaping
then
i
have
known
men
desperate
enough
to
commit
suicide
if
they
could
destroy
an
enemy
at
the
same
time
well
it
likely
all
this
worry
about
this
vessel
and
cargo
is
entirely
needless
and
foolish
i
do
believe
it
said
the
virginian
i
know
now
that
the
captain
has
been
worried
i
have
noticed
it
in
his
manner
he
is
pale
and
restless
well
it
likely
he
may
be
rather
anxious
for
it
certain
he
can
not
carry
any
insurance
on
such
a
cargo
he
was
not
at
the
table
no
i
give
something
to
be
on
solid
ground
and
away
from
this
powder
mill
you
know
that
sometimes
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
unaccountable
explosion
a
heavy
sea
must
cause
motion
or
friction
in
the
cargo
and
friction
often
starts
a
fire
on
shipboard
fire
on
this
vessel
means
a
quick
road
to
glory
huah
grunted
bruce
i
not
in
the
habit
of
worrying
about
things
that
may
happen
it
cold
out
here
let
go
back
to
the
stateroom
it
will
be
well
enough
to
keep
still
about
the
nature
of
the
cargo
diamond
said
frank
oh
i
shall
keep
still
about
that
all
right
assured
jack
as
they
moved
back
along
the
deck
they
discovered
somebody
who
was
leaning
over
the
rail
and
making
all
sorts
of
dismal
sounds
and
groans
the
next
time
i
go
to
europe
i
stay
at
home
moaned
this
individual
oh
my
oh
my
how
bad
i
feel
next
that
comes
will
be
the
shaps
of
my
twos
i
mean
the
taps
of
my
shoes
it
rattles
laughed
frank
softly
and
he
is
sicker
than
ever
tried
to
crawl
out
to
get
some
air
at
this
moment
a
man
opened
the
door
near
rattleton
and
asked
is
the
ah
er
moon
up
yet
i
do
know
moaned
harry
but
it
is
if
i
swallowed
it
everything
else
is
up
anyhow
if
the
ah
moon
comes
up
red
tonight
it
will
mean
i
do
give
a
rap
what
it
means
snorted
rattleton
do
talk
to
me
let
me
die
without
torturing
me
i
sick
enough
without
having
you
make
me
worse
slush
for
he
was
the
anxious
inquirer
about
the
moon
dodged
back
into
the
cabin
closing
the
door
hesitatingly
then
rattleton
unaware
of
the
proximity
of
his
amused
friends
hung
over
the
rail
and
groaned
again
frank
walked
up
and
spoke
i
see
my
dear
boy
that
you
are
heeding
the
bible
admonition
hey
groaned
harry
what
is
it
thy
bread
upon
the
waters
you
are
doing
it
all
right
all
right
now
do
carry
this
thing
too
far
rattleton
tried
to
say
in
a
fierce
manner
but
his
fierceness
was
laughable
the
worm
will
turn
when
trodden
upon
but
the
banana
peel
knows
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
did
you
ever
hear
that
touching
little
poem
about
the
man
who
stepped
on
a
banana
peel
never
did
why
that
is
too
bad
you
do
know
what
you
missed
listen
and
you
shall
hear
it
then
frank
solemnly
declaimed
he
walked
along
one
summer
day
as
stately
as
a
prince
he
stepped
upon
a
banana
peel
and
he
has
where
since
rattleton
gave
a
still
more
dismal
groan
you
are
conspiring
with
the
elements
to
hasten
my
death
he
said
i
ca
stand
many
more
like
that
you
should
wear
a
sheet
of
writing
paper
across
your
breast
same
as
i
do
said
diamond
then
you
wo
be
sick
i
got
two
sheets
of
writing
paper
across
mine
declared
harry
you
should
drink
a
bottle
of
ginger
ale
to
settle
your
stomach
put
in
frank
just
drank
three
bottles
of
ginger
ale
and
they
turned
my
stomach
wrong
side
out
gurgled
the
sick
youth
you
should
allow
yourself
perfect
relaxation
and
not
try
to
fight
against
it
from
browning
oh
i
have
allowed
myself
anything
else
but
perfect
relaxation
came
from
harry
you
all
make
me
tired
then
he
staggered
into
the
cabin
and
disappeared
on
his
way
back
to
the
stateroom
diamond
and
browning
followed
but
frank
lingered
behind
although
he
had
kept
the
fact
concealed
merry
was
troubled
with
a
strange
foreboding
of
coming
disaster
in
every
way
he
tried
to
overcome
anything
like
superstition
but
he
remembered
that
on
many
other
occasions
he
had
been
warned
of
coming
trouble
by
just
such
feelings
i
like
to
know
just
what
is
going
on
upon
this
steamer
he
muttered
as
he
walked
forward
i
feel
as
if
something
was
wrong
and
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
till
i
investigate
chapter
viii
in
the
frank
found
the
chief
engineer
taking
some
air
merry
fell
into
conversation
with
the
man
who
was
smoking
and
seemed
quite
willing
to
talk
having
a
pleasant
and
agreeable
way
frank
easily
led
the
engineer
on
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
man
was
quite
taken
with
the
chatty
passenger
frank
was
careful
not
to
seem
inquisitive
or
prying
for
he
knew
it
would
be
easy
to
arouse
the
engineer
suspicions
if
there
should
be
anything
wrong
on
the
steamer
however
merry
was
working
for
a
privilege
and
he
obtained
it
when
he
expressed
a
desire
to
go
below
and
have
a
look
at
the
engines
and
furnaces
the
engineer
invited
him
to
come
along
they
passed
through
a
door
and
then
began
a
descent
by
means
of
iron
ladders
the
clanking
roar
of
the
machinery
came
up
to
them
frank
could
hear
and
feel
the
throbbing
heart
beats
of
the
great
boat
the
engine
room
was
quickly
reached
and
there
the
engineer
showed
him
the
massive
machinery
that
moved
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
and
the
grace
and
ease
that
came
from
great
power
and
perfect
adjustment
all
this
was
interesting
but
frank
was
anxious
to
go
still
deeper
go
ahead
said
the
engineer
showing
him
the
way
down
that
ladder
there
you
be
able
to
see
the
furnaces
and
the
stokers
at
work
i
do
believe
you
care
to
go
into
the
frank
descended
great
heat
came
up
to
him
accompanied
by
a
glow
that
shifted
and
changed
dying
down
suddenly
at
one
moment
and
glaring
out
at
the
next
he
could
hear
the
ring
of
shovels
and
the
clank
of
iron
doors
he
reached
an
iron
grating
where
a
fierce
heat
rolled
up
and
seemed
to
scorch
him
from
that
position
he
could
look
down
into
the
and
see
the
black
grimy
sweating
men
at
work
there
above
him
at
the
head
of
the
ladder
he
had
just
descended
a
pair
of
shining
eyes
glared
down
but
he
saw
them
not
he
had
not
observed
a
cleaner
who
was
at
work
on
the
machinery
in
the
and
who
kept
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
till
frank
departed
the
blackened
stokers
looked
like
grim
demons
of
the
fiery
pit
as
they
labored
at
the
coal
which
they
were
shoveling
into
the
mouths
of
the
greedy
furnaces
the
shifting
glow
was
caused
by
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
furnace
doors
which
clanged
and
rang
for
a
moment
the
pit
below
would
seem
shrouded
in
almost
stygian
darkness
save
for
some
bar
of
light
that
gleamed
out
from
a
crack
or
draft
and
then
there
would
be
a
rattle
of
iron
and
a
flare
of
light
that
came
with
the
flinging
open
of
a
furnace
door
in
the
glare
of
light
the
stokers
would
shovel
shovel
shovel
till
it
seemed
a
wonder
that
the
fire
was
not
completely
deadened
by
so
much
coal
sometimes
the
doors
of
all
the
furnaces
would
seem
open
at
once
and
the
glare
and
heat
that
came
up
from
the
place
was
something
awful
merry
wondered
how
human
beings
could
live
down
there
in
that
terrible
place
some
of
the
men
were
raking
out
ashes
and
hoisting
it
by
means
of
a
mechanism
provided
for
the
purpose
frank
pitied
the
poor
creatures
who
were
forced
to
work
down
in
that
place
yet
he
remembered
it
was
not
so
many
months
since
he
had
applied
for
the
position
of
wiper
in
an
engine
obtained
the
job
and
worked
there
with
the
grimiest
and
lowest
employees
of
the
railroad
there
was
something
fascinating
in
the
black
pit
and
the
grimy
men
who
labored
down
there
in
the
glare
and
heat
frank
was
so
absorbed
that
he
heard
no
sound
received
no
warning
of
danger
merry
leaned
out
over
the
edge
of
the
iron
grating
something
struck
on
his
back
he
was
clutched
thrust
out
hurled
from
the
grating
it
was
done
in
a
twinkling
he
could
not
defend
himself
but
he
made
a
clutch
to
save
himself
caught
something
swung
in
struck
against
the
iron
ladder
and
went
tumbling
and
sliding
downward
at
the
moment
when
frank
was
attacked
a
glare
of
light
had
filled
the
pit
one
of
the
stokers
had
turned
his
back
to
the
gleaming
mouths
of
the
furnaces
and
looked
upward
as
if
to
relieve
his
aching
eyes
he
saw
everything
that
occurred
on
the
grating
he
saw
a
man
slip
down
the
ladder
behind
frank
and
spring
on
his
back
he
saw
that
man
hurl
frank
from
the
grating
the
stoker
uttered
a
shout
and
ran
toward
the
foot
of
the
ladder
expecting
to
find
frank
laying
there
severely
injured
or
killed
he
was
astounded
when
he
saw
the
youth
grasp
the
grating
swing
in
strike
the
ladder
cling
and
slide
down
frank
came
with
a
rush
but
he
did
not
fall
he
landed
in
the
without
being
severely
injured
he
was
on
his
feet
in
a
twinkling
and
up
that
ladder
he
went
like
a
cat
his
assailant
had
darted
up
the
ladder
above
and
disappeared
merry
reached
the
grating
from
which
he
had
been
hurled
and
then
he
ran
up
the
other
ladder
he
was
soon
in
the
in
that
room
there
was
no
excitement
the
machinery
was
sliding
and
swinging
in
a
regular
manner
while
the
engineer
sat
watching
its
movements
talking
to
an
assistant
oilers
and
cleaners
were
at
work
where
is
he
cried
frank
his
voice
sounding
clear
and
distinct
they
looked
at
him
in
amazement
what
the
matter
asked
the
engineer
coming
forward
i
was
attacked
from
behind
and
thrown
into
the
merry
explained
the
fellow
who
did
it
came
in
here
thrown
into
the
yes
from
where
the
grating
at
the
foot
of
the
first
ladder
the
engineer
looked
doubtful
my
dear
fellow
he
said
you
would
have
been
maimed
or
killed
you
do
not
seem
to
be
harmed
frank
realized
that
the
engineer
actually
doubted
his
word
he
might
have
fallen
said
the
assistant
but
it
would
have
broken
his
neck
i
tell
you
i
was
attacked
from
behind
and
thrown
down
exclaimed
frank
i
managed
to
get
hold
of
the
ladder
and
slide
so
i
was
not
killed
the
engineer
looked
annoyed
this
is
what
comes
of
letting
a
passenger
in
here
he
said
it
the
last
time
i
do
it
on
my
own
responsibility
now
if
you
go
out
and
tell
you
were
thrown
into
the
there
be
any
amount
of
fuss
over
it
i
am
telling
it
right
here
said
frank
grimly
and
i
want
to
know
who
did
the
trick
somebody
who
came
from
this
room
must
have
done
it
impossible
then
where
did
he
come
from
the
engineer
and
his
assistant
looked
at
each
other
and
the
former
began
to
swear
what
do
you
think
of
it
joe
he
asked
think
you
made
a
mistake
bill
but
his
story
wo
go
nobody
take
any
stock
in
it
frank
was
angry
it
was
something
unusual
for
his
word
to
be
doubted
and
he
felt
like
expressing
his
feelings
decidedly
he
was
saved
the
trouble
the
grimy
stoker
who
had
witnessed
the
struggle
and
the
fall
appeared
in
the
door
of
the
he
saw
frank
and
cried
hello
you
so
you
all
right
wonder
you
was
killed
you
came
down
with
a
rush
young
feller
but
you
went
back
just
as
quick
frank
understood
instantly
here
is
a
man
who
saw
it
he
cried
he
will
tell
you
that
i
am
not
lying
the
engineer
turned
to
the
stoker
how
did
he
happen
to
fall
he
asked
he
did
fall
declared
the
begrimed
coal
heaver
no
what
then
chap
jumped
on
his
back
and
flung
him
down
it
wonderful
he
was
killed
frank
was
triumphant
he
regarded
the
engineer
and
his
assistant
with
a
grim
smile
on
his
face
this
is
incredible
exclaimed
the
engineer
who
could
have
done
such
a
thing
somebody
who
came
from
this
room
rang
out
merry
clear
voice
this
shall
be
investigated
declared
the
engineer
look
around
see
if
you
can
find
the
man
who
attacked
you
the
only
ones
here
are
myself
gregory
and
the
wipers
i
want
a
look
at
those
wipers
said
frank
you
shall
have
it
gregory
and
i
were
talking
together
over
here
all
the
time
you
were
gone
oh
i
do
not
suspect
you
said
merry
but
i
want
a
good
look
at
those
wipers
did
you
see
the
man
who
threw
you
into
the
no
but
then
how
will
you
know
who
it
was
if
you
see
him
whoever
did
so
had
a
reason
for
the
act
a
motive
he
must
have
known
me
before
i
may
know
him
come
invited
the
engineer
he
called
one
of
the
wipers
down
from
amid
the
sliding
shafts
and
moving
machinery
the
man
came
unhesitatingly
frank
took
a
square
look
at
this
man
who
did
not
seek
to
avoid
inspection
never
saw
him
before
confessed
merry
the
wiper
was
dismissed
hackett
called
the
engineer
the
other
wiper
did
not
seem
to
hear
he
pretended
to
be
very
busy
and
kept
at
work
hackett
he
could
not
fail
to
hear
that
he
kept
his
face
turned
away
but
answered
yes
sir
come
here
i
want
you
the
wiper
hesitated
then
he
turned
and
slowly
approached
his
face
was
besmeared
till
scarcely
a
bit
of
natural
color
showed
and
his
hat
was
pulled
low
over
his
eyes
he
shambled
forward
awkwardly
and
stood
in
an
awkward
position
with
his
eyes
cast
down
frank
looked
at
him
closely
and
started
then
in
a
perfectly
calm
manner
but
with
a
trace
of
triumph
in
his
voice
he
declared
this
is
the
fellow
who
did
the
job
chapter
ix
in
irons
what
cried
the
engineer
in
astonishment
how
do
you
know
asked
the
engineer
assistant
incredulously
that
it
how
do
you
know
demanded
the
engineer
you
said
you
did
not
see
the
person
who
attacked
you
i
did
not
yet
you
say
this
is
the
man
yes
how
do
you
know
i
know
him
you
do
yes
you
have
seen
him
before
i
should
say
so
on
several
occasions
he
is
one
of
my
bitterest
enemies
this
is
not
the
first
time
he
has
tried
to
kill
or
injure
me
he
has
made
the
attempt
many
times
before
he
is
the
only
person
here
who
would
do
such
a
thing
if
this
is
true
said
the
engineer
grimly
he
shall
pay
dearly
for
his
work
the
assistant
nodded
what
have
you
to
say
hackett
demanded
the
engineer
i
say
it
a
lie
growled
the
fellow
i
never
saw
this
chap
before
he
came
into
the
he
does
know
me
and
i
do
know
him
you
hear
what
hackett
has
to
say
said
the
engineer
turning
to
frank
i
hear
what
this
fellow
has
to
say
but
his
name
is
not
hackett
is
not
no
no
more
than
mine
is
hackett
then
what
is
his
name
his
name
is
harris
asserted
merry
and
he
is
a
gambler
and
a
crook
i
guarantee
that
he
has
not
been
long
on
the
no
we
took
him
on
in
new
york
scarcely
two
hours
before
we
sailed
we
needed
a
man
and
he
applied
for
any
kind
of
a
job
found
he
had
worked
round
machinery
and
we
took
him
as
wiper
and
general
assistant
it
was
not
so
many
weeks
ago
that
he
attacked
me
at
new
haven
said
frank
he
failed
to
do
me
harm
when
he
found
i
was
going
abroad
he
declared
he
would
go
along
on
the
same
steamer
at
the
time
he
must
have
thought
i
was
going
by
one
of
the
regular
liners
but
it
is
plain
he
followed
me
up
pretty
close
and
found
i
was
going
over
this
way
as
there
is
no
passage
on
this
boat
he
decided
he
could
not
travel
in
the
same
class
with
me
without
being
discovered
and
he
resolved
to
go
as
one
of
the
crew
if
he
could
get
on
that
way
how
he
happens
to
be
here
if
what
you
say
is
true
it
will
go
pretty
hard
with
harris
have
him
ironed
and
a
cry
of
rage
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
accused
there
is
no
proof
he
snarled
no
one
can
swear
i
attacked
this
fellow
and
threw
him
into
the
oh
yes
said
the
stoker
who
had
come
up
from
below
i
saw
the
whole
business
by
the
light
from
the
furnaces
i
plainly
saw
the
man
who
did
it
and
you
are
the
man
that
settles
it
declared
the
engineer
you
make
the
rest
of
the
voyage
in
irons
mr
harris
then
i
give
you
something
to
iron
me
for
shouted
the
furious
young
villain
he
leaped
on
frank
merriwell
with
the
fierceness
of
a
wounded
tiger
frank
was
not
expecting
the
assault
and
for
the
moment
he
was
taken
off
his
guard
they
were
close
to
the
moving
machinery
within
four
feet
of
them
a
huge
plunging
rod
was
playing
up
and
down
moved
by
a
steel
bar
that
weighed
many
tons
harris
attempted
to
fling
frank
beneath
this
bar
where
he
would
be
struck
and
crushed
the
villain
nearly
succeeded
so
swift
and
savage
was
his
attack
frank
realized
that
the
purpose
of
the
wretch
was
to
fling
him
into
the
machinery
and
he
braced
himself
to
resist
as
quickly
as
possible
shouts
of
consternation
broke
from
the
engineer
and
his
assistant
they
sprang
forward
to
seize
harris
and
help
frank
but
before
they
could
interfere
frank
broke
the
hold
of
his
enemy
forced
him
back
and
struck
him
a
terrible
blow
between
the
eyes
felling
him
instantly
merriwell
stood
over
harris
his
hands
clenched
his
eyes
gleaming
get
up
he
cried
get
up
you
dog
i
ca
strike
you
when
you
are
down
and
i
give
a
hundred
dollars
to
hit
you
just
once
more
but
harris
did
not
get
up
he
realized
that
his
second
attempt
had
failed
and
he
stood
in
awe
of
frank
terrible
fists
he
looked
up
at
those
gleaming
eyes
and
turned
away
quickly
feeling
a
sudden
great
fear
did
frank
merriwell
bear
a
charmed
life
surely
it
seemed
that
way
to
harris
just
then
for
the
first
time
perhaps
the
young
rascal
began
to
believe
that
it
was
not
possible
to
harm
the
lad
he
hated
with
all
the
intensity
of
his
nature
the
engineer
and
his
assistants
grabbed
harris
and
held
him
the
former
swearing
savagely
they
dragged
the
fellow
to
his
feet
but
warned
him
to
stand
still
harris
did
so
for
the
moment
at
least
he
was
completely
cowed
a
man
was
sent
for
the
captain
with
instructions
to
tell
him
just
what
occurred
of
course
the
captain
of
the
steamer
was
the
only
person
who
could
order
one
of
the
men
placed
in
irons
the
captain
came
in
in
a
little
while
and
he
listened
in
great
amazement
to
the
story
of
what
had
taken
place
his
face
was
hard
and
grim
he
asked
frank
a
few
questions
and
then
he
ordered
that
harris
be
ironed
and
confined
in
the
hold
merriwell
said
the
captain
i
am
very
sorry
that
this
happened
on
my
ship
it
all
right
captain
said
frank
you
are
in
no
way
to
blame
the
fellow
shipped
with
the
intention
of
doing
just
what
he
did
if
he
found
an
opportunity
it
will
go
him
declared
the
master
he
not
get
out
of
this
without
suffering
the
penalty
harris
was
sullen
and
silent
frank
spoke
to
him
before
he
was
led
away
harris
he
said
you
have
brought
destruction
on
yourself
i
say
that
i
arm
sorry
for
you
for
by
your
persistent
attacks
on
me
you
have
destroyed
any
sympathy
i
might
have
felt
you
have
ruined
your
own
life
no
snarled
sport
you
are
the
one
you
ruined
me
if
i
go
to
prison
for
this
i
get
free
again
sometime
and
i
not
forget
you
frank
merriwell
all
the
years
i
am
behind
the
bars
will
but
add
to
the
debt
i
owe
you
when
i
come
forth
to
freedom
i
find
you
if
you
are
alive
and
i
have
your
life
then
he
was
marched
away
between
two
stout
men
his
irons
clanking
and
rattling
chapter
x
the
game
in
the
next
room
when
merry
appeared
in
his
stateroom
he
was
greeted
with
a
storm
of
questions
well
what
does
this
mean
trying
to
dodge
us
running
away
muts
the
whatter
with
you
i
mean
what
the
matter
where
have
you
been
stand
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
then
he
told
them
a
little
story
that
astounded
them
beyond
measure
he
explained
how
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
look
the
steamer
over
and
had
fallen
in
with
the
engineer
then
he
related
how
he
had
visited
the
engine
room
and
been
thrown
into
the
but
when
he
told
the
name
of
his
assailant
the
climax
was
capped
harris
gasped
rattleton
incredulously
harris
palpitated
diamond
astounded
harris
roared
browning
aroused
from
his
lazy
languidness
on
this
steamer
they
shouted
in
unison
on
this
steamer
nodded
frank
really
enjoying
the
sensation
he
had
created
he
he
attacked
you
gurgled
rattleton
seeming
to
forget
his
recent
sickness
he
did
and
you
escaped
after
being
thrown
into
the
fluttered
diamond
i
am
here
and
you
did
kill
the
cur
on
sight
roared
browning
he
is
in
the
hold
in
irons
serves
him
right
was
the
verdict
of
frank
three
friends
well
this
is
what
i
call
a
real
sensation
said
the
virginian
you
certainly
found
something
frank
well
that
fellow
has
reached
the
end
of
his
rope
at
last
said
harry
with
intense
satisfaction
once
more
stretching
himself
in
his
bunk
that
pretty
sure
nodded
jack
attempted
murder
on
the
high
seas
is
a
pretty
serious
thing
he
get
pushed
for
it
all
right
this
time
grunted
browning
beginning
to
recover
from
his
astonishment
then
they
talked
the
affair
over
and
frank
gave
them
his
theory
of
sport
presence
on
the
steamer
which
seemed
plausible
this
is
something
rather
more
interesting
than
the
superstitious
man
or
the
frenchman
said
diamond
the
superstitious
man
was
interesting
at
first
observed
merry
but
i
a
fancy
that
he
might
prove
a
bore
then
bruce
grunted
say
does
fact
and
reason
err
and
if
they
both
err
which
the
more
the
man
of
the
smallest
calibre
is
sure
to
be
the
greatest
bore
while
they
were
talking
the
sound
of
voices
came
from
the
stateroom
occupied
by
the
frenchman
soon
it
became
evident
that
quite
a
little
party
had
gathered
in
that
room
the
boys
paid
no
attention
to
the
party
till
it
came
time
to
turn
in
for
the
night
then
they
became
aware
that
something
was
taking
place
in
the
adjoining
room
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
made
out
that
it
was
a
game
of
poker
as
they
became
quiet
they
could
hear
the
murmur
of
voices
and
occasionally
some
person
would
speak
distinctly
seeing
raising
or
calling
diamond
began
to
get
nervous
say
he
observed
that
makes
me
think
of
old
times
many
a
night
i
spent
at
that
what
the
matter
with
you
said
frank
do
you
want
to
go
in
there
and
take
a
hand
well
jack
confessed
i
do
feel
an
itching
i
feel
like
getting
some
sleep
grunted
bruce
and
they
are
keeping
me
awake
why
are
they
playing
in
a
stateroom
anyhow
exclaimed
frank
it
no
place
for
a
game
of
cards
at
night
that
so
agreed
rattleton
dreamily
but
you
are
keeping
me
awake
by
your
chatter
a
good
deal
more
than
they
are
shut
up
the
whole
lot
of
you
there
was
silence
for
a
time
and
then
with
a
savage
exclamation
diamond
sprang
out
of
his
berth
and
thumped
on
the
partition
crying
come
gentlemen
it
time
to
go
to
bed
you
are
keeping
us
awake
there
was
no
response
jack
went
back
to
bed
but
the
murmuring
continued
in
the
next
stateroom
and
the
rattle
of
chips
could
be
heard
occasionally
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
merriwell
asked
jack
savagely
we
can
complain
but
making
a
complaint
was
repellent
to
a
college
youth
who
was
inclined
to
regard
as
a
cheap
fellow
anybody
who
would
do
such
a
thing
and
diamond
did
not
agree
to
that
well
said
frank
i
suppose
i
can
go
in
there
and
clean
them
all
out
how
at
their
own
game
laughed
merry
muffledly
if
anybody
in
this
crowd
tackles
them
that
way
i
be
the
one
asserted
the
virginian
then
nobody
here
will
tackle
them
that
way
said
frank
remembering
how
he
had
once
saved
diamond
from
sharpers
in
new
haven
frank
was
a
person
who
believed
that
knowledge
of
almost
any
sort
was
likely
to
prove
of
value
to
a
man
at
some
stage
of
his
career
and
he
had
made
a
practice
of
learning
everything
possible
he
had
studied
up
on
the
tricks
of
gamblers
so
that
he
knew
all
about
their
methods
of
robbing
their
victims
being
a
amateur
magician
his
knowledge
of
card
tricks
had
become
of
value
to
him
in
more
than
one
instance
he
felt
that
he
would
be
able
to
hold
his
own
against
pretty
clever
but
he
did
not
care
or
propose
to
have
any
dealings
with
such
men
unless
forced
to
do
so
the
boys
kept
still
for
a
while
their
light
was
extinguished
but
up
near
the
ceiling
a
shaft
of
light
came
through
the
partition
from
the
other
room
diamond
saw
it
he
jumped
up
and
dragged
a
trunk
into
position
by
that
partition
mounted
on
the
trunk
he
applied
his
eye
to
the
orifice
and
discovered
that
he
could
see
into
the
frenchman
room
very
nicely
what
can
you
see
grunted
browning
i
can
see
everyone
in
there
answered
jack
name
them
the
frenchman
the
englishman
the
superstitious
man
and
our
fresh
friend
bloodgood
same
old
crowd
murmured
frank
yes
and
a
hot
old
game
came
from
the
youth
on
the
trunk
my
my
but
they
are
whooping
her
up
they
got
plenty
to
drink
and
they
are
playing
for
big
dust
tell
them
to
saw
up
till
mumbled
bruce
jack
did
not
do
so
however
he
remained
on
the
trunk
watching
the
game
seeming
greatly
interested
a
big
game
of
poker
interested
him
any
time
it
was
through
the
influence
of
frank
that
he
had
been
led
to
renounce
the
game
but
the
thirst
for
its
excitements
and
delights
remained
with
him
for
he
had
come
from
a
family
of
and
sportsmen
come
come
laughed
frank
after
a
while
i
can
hear
your
teeth
chattering
old
man
get
off
that
trunk
and
turn
in
wait
fluttered
jack
wait
till
i
see
this
hand
played
out
in
less
than
half
a
minute
he
cried
it
a
skin
game
i
knew
it
was
what
the
lay
asked
merry
that
infernal
frenchman
is
a
i
suspected
as
much
his
pal
is
the
englishman
they
are
standing
in
together
yes
sure
thing
they
are
bleeding
bloodgood
and
slush
bloodgood
thinks
he
pretty
sharp
and
i
have
not
much
sympathy
for
him
but
i
am
sorry
for
poor
little
slush
he
should
have
paid
attention
to
some
of
his
signs
and
omens
he
knew
something
disastrous
would
happen
during
this
voyage
and
i
rather
think
it
will
happen
to
him
then
diamond
thumped
the
wall
again
crying
stop
that
business
in
there
slush
you
are
playing
cards
with
crooks
you
are
being
robbed
get
out
of
that
game
as
soon
as
you
can
there
was
a
sudden
silence
in
the
adjoining
room
and
then
rouen
montfort
was
heard
to
utter
an
exclamation
in
french
following
which
he
cried
i
see
you
saire
i
make
you
swallow
ze
lie
you
may
see
me
any
time
you
like
diamond
flung
back
chapter
xi
the
horrors
of
the
hold
to
the
surprise
of
the
four
youths
montfort
utterly
ignored
them
on
the
following
day
instead
of
seeking
trouble
as
had
been
anticipated
well
said
jack
in
disgust
he
has
less
courage
than
i
thought
he
is
just
a
common
boasting
frenchman
he
is
not
a
common
frenchman
declared
frank
i
believe
he
is
a
rascal
of
more
than
common
calibre
but
he
lacks
nerve
and
i
have
nothing
but
contempt
for
him
said
the
virginian
i
did
know
but
he
would
challenge
me
to
a
duel
what
if
he
had
what
if
he
had
hissed
the
southern
youth
i
fought
him
at
the
drop
of
the
hat
that
all
right
but
you
know
most
frenchmen
fight
well
in
a
duel
i
do
know
anything
of
the
kind
they
are
expert
fencers
but
i
notice
it
is
mighty
seldom
one
of
them
is
killed
in
a
duel
they
sometimes
draw
a
drop
of
blood
and
then
they
consider
that
is
satisfied
and
that
ends
it
it
was
midway
in
the
forenoon
that
frank
met
slush
on
deck
the
little
man
was
looking
more
doleful
and
dejected
than
ever
if
possible
the
ah
the
moon
showed
rather
yellow
last
night
he
said
that
is
a
a
sure
sign
of
disaster
well
said
merry
with
a
smile
i
think
the
disaster
will
befall
you
sir
if
you
do
not
steer
clear
of
the
crowd
you
were
in
last
night
slush
looked
surprised
might
i
ah
inquire
your
meaning
he
faltered
i
mean
that
you
are
playing
poker
with
and
they
mean
to
rob
you
answered
frank
plainly
i
i
wonder
how
you
er
know
so
much
said
the
little
man
with
something
like
faint
sarcasm
as
frank
fancied
it
makes
little
difference
how
i
know
it
but
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
i
am
warning
you
for
your
good
sir
er
ahem
thank
you
very
much
slush
walked
away
well
i
hanged
if
he
does
take
it
coolly
enough
muttered
frank
perplexed
frank
felt
an
interest
to
know
how
sport
harris
was
getting
along
he
walked
forward
and
found
the
captain
near
the
steps
that
led
to
the
bridge
in
reply
to
merry
inquiry
the
captain
said
oh
do
worry
about
him
there
are
rats
down
there
in
the
hold
but
i
guess
he
be
able
to
fight
them
off
he
have
bread
and
water
the
rest
of
the
voyage
after
that
merry
could
not
help
thinking
of
harris
all
alone
in
the
darkness
of
the
hold
with
swarms
of
rats
around
him
eating
dry
bread
washed
down
with
water
frank
felt
that
the
youthful
villain
did
not
deserve
any
sympathy
but
despite
himself
he
could
not
help
feeling
a
pang
of
pity
for
him
when
he
expressed
himself
thus
to
his
friends
however
they
scoffed
at
him
serves
the
dog
right
flashed
diamond
he
is
getting
just
what
he
deserves
and
i
glad
of
it
he
will
get
what
he
deserves
when
we
reach
the
other
side
grunted
browning
no
said
merry
he
is
an
american
and
he
have
to
be
taken
back
to
the
united
states
for
punishment
well
he
get
it
all
right
well
i
do
care
to
think
that
he
may
be
driven
mad
shut
up
in
the
dark
hold
with
the
rats
this
feeling
grew
on
frank
at
last
he
went
to
the
captain
and
asked
liberty
to
see
harris
the
request
was
granted
and
accompanied
by
two
men
frank
descended
into
the
hold
down
there
amid
barrels
and
casks
they
came
upon
harris
frank
heard
the
irons
rattle
and
then
a
creature
rose
up
before
them
shown
by
the
yellow
light
of
the
lanterns
frank
merriwell
had
steady
nerves
but
despite
himself
he
started
the
appearance
of
the
fellow
had
changed
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
harris
looked
as
if
he
was
overcome
with
terror
there
he
is
said
one
of
the
men
holding
up
his
lantern
so
the
light
fell
more
plainly
on
the
wretched
prisoner
have
you
come
to
take
me
out
of
here
cried
harris
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
gave
frank
a
chill
for
god
sake
take
me
out
of
this
place
i
go
mad
if
i
stay
here
much
longer
it
is
full
of
rats
i
could
not
sleep
last
night
i
dare
not
close
my
eyes
for
a
minute
please
please
take
me
out
of
here
then
he
saw
and
recognized
frank
you
he
screamed
have
you
come
here
to
gloat
over
me
frank
merriwell
no
said
frank
i
have
come
to
see
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
ha
ha
ha
laughed
harris
in
a
manner
that
made
frank
believe
madness
could
not
be
far
away
you
would
do
that
i
know
why
you
are
here
you
have
triumphed
over
me
you
wish
to
see
me
in
all
my
misery
well
look
at
me
here
i
have
been
thrown
into
this
hellish
hole
amid
rats
and
vermin
ironed
like
a
nigger
look
till
you
are
satisfied
it
will
fill
your
heart
with
satisfaction
mock
me
sneer
at
me
deride
me
i
have
no
desire
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
declared
frank
i
am
sorry
for
you
harris
sorry
bah
you
lie
why
do
you
tell
me
that
it
is
the
truth
you
brought
this
on
yourself
and
so
do
tell
me
that
again
you
have
told
it
enough
if
i
never
seen
you
i
not
be
here
now
you
brought
it
on
me
frank
merriwell
if
i
die
here
in
this
cursed
hole
you
have
something
pleasant
to
think
about
you
can
laugh
over
it
you
shall
not
die
here
harris
if
i
can
help
it
i
speak
to
the
captain
about
you
the
wretch
stared
at
merry
his
eyes
looking
sunken
and
glittering
then
all
at
once
he
crouched
down
there
his
chains
clanking
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
began
to
cry
no
matter
what
harris
had
done
frank
was
deeply
pitiful
then
i
shall
go
directly
to
the
captain
he
promised
and
i
ask
him
to
have
you
taken
out
of
this
place
i
will
urge
him
to
have
it
done
harris
said
nothing
frank
had
seen
enough
and
he
turned
away
as
they
were
moving
off
harris
began
to
scream
and
call
to
them
begging
them
not
to
leave
him
there
in
the
darkness
those
cries
cut
through
and
through
frank
merriwell
he
knew
he
was
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
fate
that
had
befallen
the
fellow
and
yet
he
felt
that
he
must
do
something
for
harris
he
kept
his
word
going
directly
to
the
captain
chapter
xii
the
finish
of
a
thrilling
game
the
captain
listened
to
what
frank
had
to
say
but
his
sternness
did
not
seem
to
relax
in
the
least
as
merry
described
the
sufferings
the
prisoner
was
enduring
but
frank
would
not
be
satisfied
till
the
captain
had
made
a
promise
to
visit
harris
himself
and
see
that
the
fellow
was
taken
out
and
cared
for
if
he
needed
it
needless
to
say
that
the
captain
forgot
to
make
the
visit
right
away
frank
did
not
tell
his
friends
where
he
had
been
and
what
he
had
seen
he
did
not
feel
like
talking
about
it
and
they
noticed
that
he
looked
strangely
grim
and
thoughtful
tutor
maybe
tried
to
talk
to
him
about
studies
but
merry
was
in
no
mood
for
that
as
his
instructor
soon
discovered
despite
the
fact
that
the
sea
was
running
high
rattleton
seemed
to
have
recovered
in
a
great
measure
from
his
sickness
so
he
was
able
to
get
on
deck
with
the
others
at
noon
he
even
went
to
the
table
and
ate
lightly
drinking
ginger
ale
with
his
food
an
hour
after
dinner
frank
found
a
game
of
poker
going
on
in
the
slush
was
in
the
game
so
were
the
frenchman
the
englishman
and
bloodgood
no
money
was
in
sight
but
it
was
plain
enough
from
the
manner
in
which
the
game
was
played
that
the
chips
each
man
held
had
been
purchased
for
genuine
money
and
the
game
was
one
for
blood
montfort
looked
up
for
a
moment
as
frank
stopped
to
watch
the
game
their
eyes
met
the
frenchman
permitted
a
sneer
to
steal
across
his
face
while
frank
looked
at
him
steadily
till
his
eyes
dropped
at
a
glance
merry
saw
that
bloodgood
was
shakey
the
fellow
had
been
growing
worse
and
worse
as
the
voyage
progressed
and
now
he
seemed
on
the
verge
of
a
a
few
minutes
after
entering
the
room
frank
heard
one
of
the
spectators
whisper
to
another
that
bloodgood
was
bulling
the
game
and
had
lost
heavily
bloodgood
was
drinking
deeply
slush
seemed
to
be
indulging
rather
freely
the
frenchman
sipped
a
little
wine
now
and
then
and
the
englishman
drank
at
regular
intervals
the
frenchman
was
perfectly
cool
the
englishman
was
phlegmatic
slush
hesitated
sometimes
but
to
the
surprise
of
the
boys
seemed
rather
collected
bloodgood
was
hot
and
excited
frank
took
a
position
where
he
could
look
on
he
watched
every
move
after
a
time
he
discerned
that
the
englishman
and
the
frenchman
were
playing
to
each
other
although
the
trick
was
done
so
skillfully
that
it
did
not
seem
apparent
bloodgood
lost
all
his
chips
the
game
was
held
up
for
a
few
moments
he
stepped
into
the
next
room
and
returned
with
a
fresh
supply
this
is
the
bottom
he
declared
you
people
may
have
them
as
soon
as
you
like
to
blazes
with
them
let
lift
the
limit
ah
er
let
throw
it
off
entirely
suggested
slush
bloodgood
glared
at
the
little
man
in
astonishment
what
he
cried
you
propose
that
why
you
did
want
to
play
a
bigger
game
than
a
quarter
limit
at
the
start
perhaps
you
are
er
right
admitted
slush
i
er
do
deny
it
but
i
have
grown
more
more
interested
you
understand
i
i
do
mind
playing
a
good
game
now
well
then
if
the
other
gentlemen
say
so
by
the
gods
we
make
it
no
limit
bloodgood
almost
shouted
the
frenchman
bowed
suavely
a
slight
smile
curling
the
ends
of
his
pointed
mustache
upward
i
haf
not
ze
least
what
you
call
eet
ze
least
objectshong
he
purred
i
do
mind
said
the
englishman
now
there
was
great
interest
somehow
frank
felt
that
a
climax
was
coming
he
watched
everything
with
deep
interest
luck
continued
to
run
against
bloodgood
to
frank
surprise
it
was
plain
slush
was
winning
this
seemed
to
surprise
and
puzzle
both
the
englishman
and
the
frenchman
it
was
hard
work
to
draw
the
little
man
in
when
hazleton
or
montfort
dealt
on
his
own
deal
or
that
of
bloodgood
he
seemed
ready
for
anything
by
jove
whispered
frank
in
diamond
ear
that
man
is
not
such
a
fool
as
i
thought
i
have
been
able
to
understand
him
at
all
and
i
do
understand
him
now
at
length
there
came
a
big
it
was
passed
round
several
times
then
hazleton
opened
it
on
three
nines
bloodgood
sat
next
he
had
two
pairs
aces
up
and
he
raised
instantly
montfort
was
the
next
man
he
held
a
pair
of
deuces
but
he
saw
all
that
had
been
bet
and
doubled
the
amount
slush
hesitated
a
little
he
seemed
ready
to
lay
down
but
finally
braced
up
and
came
in
calling
hazleton
did
not
accept
the
call
he
raised
again
bloodgood
looked
at
his
hand
and
cursed
under
his
breath
it
was
just
good
enough
to
make
him
feel
that
he
ought
to
make
another
raise
but
he
began
to
think
there
were
other
good
hands
out
and
it
was
not
possible
to
tell
where
continued
raising
would
land
him
so
he
made
good
with
nothing
but
a
pair
of
deuces
in
his
hand
montfort
cracked
her
up
again
for
a
good
round
sum
the
hair
on
the
head
of
slush
seemed
to
stand
he
swallowed
and
looked
pale
then
he
made
good
hazleton
had
his
turn
again
and
he
improved
it
for
the
next
few
minutes
montfort
and
hazleton
had
a
merry
time
raising
but
neither
slush
nor
bloodgood
threw
up
this
is
where
they
are
sinking
the
knife
in
the
suckers
muttered
jack
diamond
frank
merriwell
said
not
a
word
his
eyes
were
watching
every
move
at
last
the
betting
stopped
and
slush
picked
up
the
pack
to
give
out
the
cards
hazleton
called
for
two
he
received
them
and
remained
imperturbable
he
had
caught
nothing
with
his
three
nines
bloodgood
had
tumbled
to
the
fact
that
he
was
up
against
threes
and
he
had
discarded
his
pair
of
low
cards
holding
only
the
two
aces
to
these
he
drew
a
seven
and
two
more
aces
bloodgood
turned
pale
and
then
flushed
he
held
onto
himself
with
all
his
strength
here
was
his
chance
to
get
back
his
losings
everything
was
in
his
favor
he
was
confident
there
were
some
good
hands
out
and
it
was
very
likely
some
of
them
might
be
improved
on
the
draw
but
he
felt
the
pot
was
the
same
as
his
the
frenchman
drew
two
cards
slush
took
one
then
hot
work
began
within
three
minutes
hazleton
with
his
three
nines
had
been
driven
out
bloodgood
montfort
and
slush
remained
raising
steadily
there
was
intense
excitement
in
that
room
the
captain
of
the
steamer
had
come
in
and
he
was
looking
on
some
of
the
spectators
were
literally
shaking
with
excitement
bloodgood
chips
were
used
up
he
flung
money
on
the
table
all
that
he
had
went
into
the
pot
and
still
he
would
not
call
he
offered
his
but
slush
declined
to
agree
money
or
its
equivalent
said
the
little
man
with
such
decisiveness
that
all
were
astonished
i
have
any
money
protested
bloodgood
then

are
out

bloodgood

the
frenchman

shouted
bloodgood
into
an
inner
pocket
he
plunged
he
brought
out
a
velvet
jewel
box
when
this
was
opened
there
was
a
cry
of
wonder
for
a
magnificent
diamond
necklace
was
revealed
that
is
worth
ten
thousand
dollars
declared
bloodgood
and
i
bet
as
long
as
it
lasts
slush
held
out
his
hand
please
let
me
examine
it
he
said
he
took
a
good
look
at
it
ees
it
all

asked
the
frenchman
eagerly
it
is
said
slush
and
i
will
take
charge
of
it
he
thrust
the
case
into
his
pocket
rose
quickly
stepped
past
montfort
and
clapped
a
hand
on
bloodgood
shoulder
i

said

bloodgood

a

showed

and
raked
in
the

with
a
savage
cry
montfort
flung
his
hand
aside
leaped
to
his
feet
sprang
at
frank
and
struck
for
merry
face
the
blow
was
parried
and
he
was
knocked
down
instantly
a
sailor
pale
and
shaking
came
dashing
into
the
room
and
whispered
a
word
in
the
captain
ear
an
oath
broke
from
the
captain
lips
and
he
whirled
about
and
rushed
from
the
room
slowly
montfort
picked
himself
up
there
was
a
livid
mark
on
his
cheek
he
glared
at
frank
with
deadly
hatred
cursed
meddlaire
he
grated
you
shall
pay
for
this
there
was
consternation
outside
on
the
deck
was
heard
the
sound
of
running
feet
something
has
happened
said
diamond
hurrying
to
the
door
i
wonder
what
it
is
the
eagle
was
plunging
along
through
a
heavy
sea
on
the
deck
some
men
were
running
to
and
fro
everyone
seemed
in
the
greatest
consternation
jack
sprang
out
and
stopped
a
man
what
is
the
matter
he
demanded
the
ship
is
on
fire
was
the
shaking
answer
there
is
a
fire
in
the
hold
diamond
staggered
he
whirled
about
and
sprang
into
the
in
a
moment
he
was
at
frank
side
merry
he
said
what
i
feared
has
come
the
steamer
is
on
fire
where
in
the
hold
frank
remembered
the
barrels
and
casks
he
had
seen
there
then
we
are
liable
to
go
scooting
skyward
in
a
hurry
he
said
it
ca
take
the
fire
long
to
reach
the
petroleum
and
powder
chapter
xiv
saving
an
enemy
in
truth
there
was
a
fire
in
the
eagle
hold
the
captain
and
the
crew
seemed
perfectly
the
thought
of
the
explosion
that
might
come
any
moment
seemed
to
rob
them
of
all
reason
frank
merriwell
and
his
friends
rushed
out
of
the
the
hold
had
been
opened
in
an
attempt
to
get
water
onto
the
flames
smoke
was
rolling
up
from
the
opening
close
down
the
hatch
shouted
somebody
it
is
producing
a
draft
and
that
helps
the
fire
along
then
faint
cries
came
from
the
hold
cries
of
a
human
being
in
danger
and
distress
it
harris
exclaimed
diamond
he
is
down
there
and
his
time
has
come
at
last
a
rope
shouted
frank
merriwell
flinging
off
his
coat
what
are
you
going
to
do
demanded
bruce
browning
by
heavens
i
am
going
down
there
and
try
to
bring
harris
out
you
a
fool
chattered
harry
rattleton
think
of
the
oil
and
powder
down
there
the
stuff
is
liable
to
explode
any
moment
you
shall
not
go
frank
saw
a
coil
of
rope
at
a
distance
he
rushed
for
it
brought
it
to
the
hold
let
an
end
drop
and
dangle
into
the
darkness
from
whence
the
smoke
rolled
up
you
are
crazy
roared
bruce
browning
attempting
to
get
hold
of
frank
i
refuse
to
let
you
go
down
there
do
put
your
hands
on
me
browning
cried
frank
if
you
do
i
shall
knock
you
down
they
saw
that
he
meant
just
what
he
said
he
would
not
be
stopped
then
bruce
browning
giant
that
he
was
felt
that
he
would
be
no
match
for
frank
then
the
rope
was
made
fast
and
down
into
the
smoke
and
darkness
slid
frank
disappearing
from
view
barely
had
he
done
so
when
some
sailors
came
rushing
forward
and
attempted
to
close
the
hatch
hold
on
thundered
browning
you
ca
do
that
now
get
out
of
the
way
commanded
one
of
them
who
seemed
to
be
an
officer
we
must
close
this
hatch
to
hold
the
fire
in
check
long
enough
for
the
boats
to
be
lowered
a
friend
of
mine
has
gone
down
there
you
ca
close
it
till
he
comes
out
to
blazes
with
your
friend
snarled
the
man
what
business
had
he
to
go
down
there
if
he
gone
he
will
have
to
stay
there
his
life
does
not
count
against
all
the
others
then
under
his
directions
the
men
started
to
close
the
hatch
browning
sailed
into
them
he
was
aroused
to
his
full
extent
by
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
if
the
hatch
was
closed
and
frank
was
shut
down
there
with
the
fire
and
smoke
he
knocked
them
aside
he
hurled
them
away
as
if
they
were
children
they
could
not
stand
before
him
for
an
instant
there
was
a
cry
from
below
pull
away
up
there
it
was
frank
voice
willing
hands
seized
the
rope
there
was
a
heavy
weight
at
the
end
of
it
they
dragged
the
weight
up
with
the
smoke
rolling
into
their
faces
in
a
cloud
that
grew
denser
and
denser
and
up
through
the
smoke
came
sport
harris
irons
and
all
with
the
ends
of
the
rope
tied
about
his
waist
frank
had
found
harris
and
here
the
fellow
was
they
untied
the
rope
from
sport
waist
in
a
hurry
then
they
lowered
it
again
pull
away
frank
merriwell
was
dragged
up
through
the
smoke
now
said
browning
down
goes
the
hatch
and
it
was
slammed
into
place
in
a
hurry
holding
the
smoke
back
chapter
xv
the
sea
gives
up
the
pumps
were
going
in
an
attempt
to
flood
the
hold
but
the
men
did
not
attempt
to
fight
the
fire
in
anything
like
a
reasonable
manner
the
knowledge
of
the
cargo
down
there
in
the
hold
turned
them
to
cowards
and
unreasoning
beings
they
were
expecting
to
be
blown
skyward
at
any
moment
of
a
sudden
the
engines
stopped
and
the
eagle
began
to
lose
headway
men
were
making
preparations
to
lower
the
boats
well
i
be
hanged
if
they
are
not
going
to
abandon
the
ship
exclaimed
frank
the
case
must
be
pretty
bad
i
wonder
how
the
fire
started
i
set
it
at
his
feet
was
harris
whom
he
had
just
rescued
from
the
hell
below
and
the
fellow
had
declared
that
he
set
the
fire
you
yes
said
the
wretch
i
was
crazy
i
found
a
match
in
my
pocket
and
i
thought
i
was
willing
to
roast
if
i
could
destroy
you
so
i
set
the
fire
pretty
soon
i
realized
what
i
had
done
but
then
i
found
it
too
late
when
i
tried
to
beat
it
out
the
old
steamer
will
go
into
the
air
in
a
few
minutes
and
we
all
go
with
it
unless
we
can
get
off
in
the
boats
right
away
it
would
have
served
you
right
had
i
left
you
to
your
fate
grated
frank
as
he
turned
away
he
ran
down
to
his
stateroom
to
gather
up
some
of
the
few
little
valuables
he
hoped
to
save
he
was
not
gone
long
but
when
he
returned
he
found
two
boats
had
been
launched
and
were
pulling
away
the
persons
in
them
being
in
great
haste
to
get
as
far
from
the
steamer
as
they
could
before
the
explosion
three
or
four
women
were
in
the
first
boat
it
was
rather
difficult
to
lower
the
boats
in
the
heavy
sea
that
was
running
but
the
men
were
working
swiftly
pushed
by
the
terror
of
the
coming
disaster
a
little
smoke
curled
up
from
the
hatches
as
frank
reached
the
deck
he
nearly
ran
against
rouen
montfort
who
was
carrying
a
pair
of
swords
in
scabbards
which
seemed
to
be
treasures
he
wished
to
save
the
frenchman
stopped
and
glared
at
merry
cursed
yankee
he
grated
i
would
like
to
put
one
of
zese
gude
blades
your
heart
have
a
doubt
of
it
said
merriwell
coolly
that
about
the
kind
of
a
man
i
took
you
to
be
another
boat
got
away
and
the
last
boat
was
swung
from
the
davits
a
sailor
counted
the
men
who
remained
and
spoke
to
the
captain
the
latter
said
at
best
the
boat
will
not
hold
them
all
there
is
one
too
many
at
least
let
the
fellow
in
irons
stay
behind
harris
heard
this
and
fancied
his
doom
was
sealed
he
began
to
beg
to
be
taken
along
but
one
of
the
men
gave
him
a
kick
the
frenchman
turned
on
frank
do
you
hear
he
cried
one

not

he
spat
toward
merry
to
express
his
contempt
let
me
fight
him
panted
diamond
at
frank
elbow
see
that
harris
is
put
into
the
boat
ordered
merriwell
i
fancy
i
can
take
care
of
this
frenchman
if
you
do
not
get
harris
into
the
boat
i
swear
i
will
not
enter
it
if
i
conquer
montfort
then
he
whirled
on
the
frenchman
i
accept
your
challenge
he
cried
in
clear
tones
montfort
uttered
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
he
flung
off
his
coat
saying
choose
ze
weapon
saire
frank
did
not
pause
to
look
them
over
in
making
a
selection
he
caught
up
one
of
them
and
drew
it
from
the
scabbard
montfort
took
the
other
ready
cried
the
american
youth
ready
answered
the
frenchman
clash
the
swords
came
together
and
there
on
the
deck
of
the
burning
steamer
the
strange
duel
began
frank
fought
with
all
the
coolness
and
skill
he
could
command
he
fought
as
if
he
had
been
standing
on
solid
ground
instead
of
the
deck
of
a
ship
that
might
be
blown
into
a
thousand
fragments
at
any
moment
the
frenchman
had
fancied
that
the
yankee
would
prove
easy
to
conquer
but
he
soon
discovered
frank
possessed
no
little
skill
and
he
saw
that
he
must
do
his
best
more
than
once
montfort
thrust
to
run
frank
through
the
body
and
once
his
sword
passed
between
the
youth
left
arm
and
his
side
merry
saw
that
the
frenchman
really
meant
to
kill
him
if
possible
then
men
were
getting
into
the
boat
there
were
but
few
seconds
left
in
which
to
finish
the
duel
rattleton
called
to
him
from
the
boat
shouting
above
the
roar
of
the
wind
finish
him
frank
come
on
now
lively
the
tip
of
montfort
sword
slit
frank
sleeve
and
touched
his
arm
next
time
i
get
you
hissed
the
vindictive
frenchman
but
right
then
frank
saw
his
opportunity
he
made
a
lunge
and
drove
his
sword
into
the
frenchman
side
montfort
uttered
a
cry
dropped
his
sword
flung
up
his
hands
and
sunk
bleeding
to
the
deck
merry
flung
his
weapon
aside
and
bent
over
the
man
saying
sincerely
i
hope
your
wound
is
not
fatal
m
montfort
it
makes
no
difference
gasped
the
man
you
are
ze
victor
so
i
must
stay
here
an
die
jus
ze
same
but
frank
merriwell
was
seized
by
a
feeling
of
horror
at
the
thought
of
leaving
this
man
whom
he
had
wounded
in
a
moment
he
realized
he
would
be
haunted
all
his
life
by
the
memory
if
he
did
so
quickly
he
caught
montfort
up
in
his
arms
he
sprang
to
the
side
of
the
steamer
the
boat
was
holding
in
for
him
his
friends
shouted
to
him
the
captain
ordered
him
to
jump
at
once
catch
this
man
he
lifted
montfort
swung
him
over
the
rail
and
dropped
him
fairly
into
the
boat
he
has
chosen
said
the
captain
the
boat
will
hold
no
more
pull
away
it
was
useless
for
frank
friends
to
beg
and
plead
away
went
the
boat
leaving
the
noble
youth
to
his
doom
forty
minutes
later
there
was
a
terrible
flare
of
fire
and
smoke
a
thunderous
explosion
and
the
steamer
had
blown
up
harry
rattleton
was
crying
like
a
baby
poor
frank
he
sobbed
noblest
fellow
in
all
the
world
never
see
you
again
tears
rolled
down
bruce
browning
face
and
jack
diamond
grim
and
speechless
looked
as
if
the
light
of
the
world
had
gone
out
forever
some
days
later
the
passengers
and
crew
from
the
lost
eagle
were
landed
at
liverpool
by
the
steamer
seneca
which
had
picked
them
up
at
sea
the
seneca
was
a
slow
old
craft
but
she
got
there
all
right
a
little
grimy
tender
carried
bruce
jack
harry
and
the
tutor
from
the
seneca
to
the
floating
dock
it
was
a
sad
and
party
on
the
dock
stood
a
young
man
who
shouted
to
them
and
waved
his
hand
jack
diamond
started
gasped
clutched
browning
and
whispered
look
look
there
bruce
tell
me
if
i
am
going
crazy
or
do
you
see
somebody
who
looks
like
harry
rattleton
clutched
the
big
fellow
by
the
other
side
spluttering
am
i
doing
gaffy
i
mean
going
daffy
look
there
who
is
that
waving
his
hand
to
us
it
the
ghost
of
frank
merriwell
as
true
as
there
are
such
things
as
ghosts
muttered
browning
but
it
was
no
ghost
it
was
frank
merriwell
in
the
flesh
alive
and
well
he
greeted
them
as
they
came
off
the
tender
he
caught
them
in
his
arms
laughing
shouting
overjoyed
and
they
realizing
it
really
was
him
hugged
him
and
wept
like
a
lot
of
manly
young
men
frank
explained
in
a
few
words
he
told
how
after
they
had
left
him
he
had
belted
himself
well
with
and
left
the
eagle
in
time
to
get
away
before
the
explosion
then
he
was
picked
up
by
an
atlantic
liner
which
brought
him
to
liverpool
in
advance
of
his
friends
thus
he
was
there
to
receive
them
and
it
seemed
that
the
sea
had
given
up
its
dead
the
end
