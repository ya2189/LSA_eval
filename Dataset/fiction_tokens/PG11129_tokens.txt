the

of
great
importance
although
composed
of
but
two
letters
it
will
be
of
great
service
in
keeping
us
from
the
path
of
sin
and
misery
and
of
inducing
us
to
walk
in
wisdom
ways
whose
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness
and
all
whose
paths
are
peace
exercise
charity

be
a
comfort

january
story
about
the
word
no
by
arthur
there
is
a
word
my
son
a
very
little
word
in
the
english
language
the
right
use
of
which
it
is
all
important
that
you
should
learn
howland
said
to
his
son
thomas
who
was
about
leaving
the
paternal
roof
for
a
residence
in
a
neighboring
city
never
again
perchance
to
make
one
of
the
little
circle
that
had
so
long
gathered
in
the
family
homestead
and
what
word
is
that
father
thomas
asked
it
is
the
little
word
my
son
and
why
does
so
much
importance
attach
to
that
word
father
perhaps
i
can
make
you
understand
the
reason
much
better
if
i
relate
an
incident
that
occurred
when
i
was
a
boy
i
remember
it
as
distinctly
as
if
it
had
taken
place
but
yesterday
although
thirty
years
have
since
passed
there
was
a
neighbor
of
my
father
who
was
very
fond
of
gunning
and
fishing
on
several
occasions
i
had
accompanied
him
and
had
enjoyed
myself
very
much
one
day
my
father
said
to
me
i
do
not
wish
you
to
go
into
the
woods
or
on
the
water
again
with
mr
jones
not
father
i
asked
for
i
had
become
so
fond
of
going
with
him
that
to
be
denied
the
pleasure
was
a
real
privation
have
good
reasons
for
not
wishing
you
to
go
william
my
father
replied
do
not
want
to
give
them
now
i
hope
it
is
for
you
that
your
father
desires
you
not
to
accompany
jones
again
i
could
not
understand
why
my
father
laid
upon
me
this
prohibition
and
as
i
desired
very
much
to
go
i
did
not
feel
satisfied
in
my
obedience
on
the
next
day
as
i
was
walking
along
the
road
i
met
jones
with
his
fishing
rod
on
his
shoulder
and
his
basket
in
his
hand
william
you
are
the
very
one
that
i
wish
to
see
said
jones
smiling
am
going
out
this
morning
and
want
company
we
shall
have
a
beautiful
day
my
father
told
me
yesterday
i
replied
he
did
not
wish
me
to
go
out
with
you
why
not
pray
asked
jones
am
sure
that
i
do
not
know
i
said
indeed
i
should
like
to
go
very
much
never
mind
come
along
he
said
father
will
never
know
it
but
i
am
afraid
that
he
will
i
replied
thinking
more
of
my
father
displeasure
than
of
the
evil
of
disobedience
is
no
danger
at
all
of
that
we
will
be
home
again
long
before
i
hesitated
and
he
urged
and
finally
i
moved
the
way
that
he
was
going
and
had
proceeded
a
few
hundred
yards
when
i
stopped
and
said
do
like
to
go
mr
jones
william
there
is
no
harm
in
fishing
i
am
sure
i
have
often
been
out
with
your
father
myself
much
as
i
felt
inclined
to
go
still
i
hesitated
for
i
could
not
fully
make
up
my
mind
to
disobey
my
at
length
he
said
ca
wait
here
for
you
william
come
along
or
go
back
say
yes
or
no
this
was
the
decisive
moment
i
was
to
make
up
my
mind
and
fix
my
determination
in
one
way
or
the
other
i
was
to
say
or
no
i
ca
stay
here
all
day
jones
remarked
rather
harshly
seeing
that
i
hesitated
at
the
same
moment
the
image
of
my
father
rose
distinctly
before
my
mind
and
i
saw
his
eyes
fixed
steadily
and
reprovingly
upon
me
with
one
desperate
resolution
i
uttered
the
word
and
then
turning
ran
away
as
fast
as
my
feet
would
carry
me
i
can
not
tell
you
how
relieved
i
felt
when
i
was
far
beyond
the
reach
of
temptation
on
the
next
morning
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
i
was
startled
and
surprised
to
learn
that
jones
had
been
drowned
on
the
day
before
instead
of
returning
in
a
few
hours
as
he
had
stated
to
me
that
he
would
he
remained
out
all
the
day
a
sudden
storm
arose
his
boat
was
capsized
and
he
drowned
i
shuddered
when
i
heard
this
sad
and
fatal
accident
that
little
word
no
had
in
all
probability
saved
my
life
will
now
tell
you
william
my
father
said
turning
to
me
i
did
not
wish
you
to
go
with
mr
of
late
he
had
taken
to
drinking
and
i
had
learned
within
a
few
days
that
whenever
he
went
out
on
a
fishing
or
gunning
excursion
he
took
his
bottle
of
spirits
with
him
and
usually
returned
a
good
deal
intoxicated
i
could
not
trust
you
with
such
a
man
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
state
this
to
you
for
i
was
sure
that
i
had
only
to
express
my
wish
that
you
would
not
accompany
him
to
insure
your
implicit
obedience
i
felt
keenly
rebuked
at
this
and
resolved
never
again
to
permit
even
the
thought
of
disobedience
to
find
a
place
in
my
mind
from
that
time
i
have
felt
the
value
of
the
word
no
and
have
generally
ever
since
been
able
to
use
it
on
all
right
it
has
saved
me
from
many
troubles
often
and
often
in
life
have
i
been
urged
to
do
things
that
my
judgment
told
me
were
wrong
on
such
occasions
i
always
remembered
my
first
temptation
and
resolutely
said
and
now
my
son
continued
howland
do
you
understand
the
importance
of
the
word
i
think
i
do
father
thomas
replied
but
is
there
not
danger
of
my
using
it
too
often
and
thus
becoming
selfish
in
all
my
feelings
and
consequently
unwilling
to
render
benefits
to
others
certainly
there
is
thomas
the
legitimate
use
of
this
word
is
to
resist
evil
to
refuse
to
do
a
good
action
is
wrong
if
any
one
asks
me
then
to
do
him
a
favor
or
kindness
i
should
not
on
any
account
say
no
that
will
depend
thomas
in
what
manner
you
are
to
render
him
a
kindness
if
you
can
do
so
without
really
injuring
yourself
or
others
then
it
is
a
duty
which
you
owe
to
all
men
to
be
kind
and
render
favors
but
the
difficulty
i
feel
will
be
for
me
to
discriminate
when
i
am
urged
to
do
something
by
one
whom
i
esteem
my
regard
for
him
or
my
desire
to
render
him
an
obligation
will
be
so
strong
as
to
obscure
my
judgment
a
consciousness
of
this
weakness
in
your
character
thomas
should
put
you
upon
your
guard
that
is
very
true
father
but
i
can
not
help
fearing
myself
still
i
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
said
and
i
will
try
my
best
to
act
from
a
conviction
of
right
do
so
my
son
and
ever
bear
in
mind
that
a
wrong
action
is
followed
by
pain
of
mind
and
too
frequently
by
evil
consequences
if
you
would
avoid
these
ever
act
from
a
consciousness
that
you
are
doing
right
without
regard
to
others
if
another
asks
you
from
a
selfish
desire
to
benefit
or
gratify
himself
to
do
that
which
your
judgment
tells
you
is
wrong
surely
you
should
have
no
hesitation
in
refusing
the
precept
of
his
father
enforced
when
they
were
about
parting
and
at
a
time
when
his
affections
for
that
father
were
active
and
intense
lingered
in
the
mind
of
thomas
howland
he
saw
and
felt
its
force
and
resolved
to
act
in
obedience
to
it
if
ever
tempted
to
do
wrong
on
leaving
the
paternal
roof
he
went
to
a
neighboring
town
and
entered
the
store
of
a
merchant
where
were
several
young
men
nearly
of
his
own
age
that
is
between
eighteen
and
twenty
with
one
of
these
named
boyd
he
soon
formed
an
intimate
acquaintance
but
unfortunately
the
moral
character
of
this
young
man
was
far
from
being
pure
or
his
principles
from
resting
upon
the
firm
basis
of
truth
and
honor
his
growing
influence
over
thomas
howland
was
apparent
in
inducing
him
to
stay
away
from
church
on
the
and
pass
the
time
that
had
heretofore
been
spent
in
the
place
of
worship
in
roaming
about
the
wharves
of
the
city
or
in
excursions
into
the
country
this
influence
was
slightly
resisted
thomas
being
ashamed
or
reluctant
to
use
the
word
on
what
seemed
to
all
the
young
men
around
him
a
matter
of
so
little
importance
still
his
own
heart
condemned
him
for
he
felt
that
it
would
pain
his
father
and
mother
exceedingly
if
they
knew
that
he
neglected
to
attend
church
at
least
once
on
the
and
he
was
besides
of
wrong
in
what
seemed
to
him
a
violation
of
the
precept
the
as
he
had
been
taught
to
regard
that
precept
but
once
having
given
way
he
felt
almost
powerless
to
resist
the
influence
that
now
bore
upon
him
the
next
violation
of
what
seemed
to
him
a
right
course
for
a
young
man
to
pursue
was
in
suffering
himself
to
be
persuaded
to
visit
frequently
the
theatre
although
his
father
had
expressly
desired
that
he
would
avoid
a
place
where
lurked
for
the
young
and
inexperienced
so
many
dangers
he
was
next
easily
persuaded
to
visit
a
favorite
in
which
many
hours
were
spent
during
the
evenings
of
each
week
with
boyd
and
others
in
eating
drinking
and
smoking
sometimes
dominos
and
backgammon
were
introduced
and
at
length
were
played
for
a
slight
stake
to
participate
in
this
thomas
refused
on
the
plea
that
he
did
not
know
enough
of
the
games
to
risk
anything
he
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
declare
that
he
considered
it
wrong
to
gamble
all
these
departures
from
what
he
had
been
taught
by
his
father
to
consider
a
right
course
were
attended
by
much
uneasiness
and
pain
of
but
he
had
yielded
to
the
tempter
and
he
could
not
find
the
power
within
him
to
resist
his
influence
successfully
it
happened
about
six
months
after
his
introduction
to
such
an
entirely
new
course
of
life
that
he
was
invited
one
evening
by
his
companion
boyd
to
call
on
a
friend
with
him
he
had
on
that
day
received
from
his
father
forty
dollars
with
which
to
buy
him
a
new
suit
of
clothes
and
a
few
other
necessary
articles
he
went
of
course
and
was
introduced
to
a
very
affable
gentlemanly
young
man
in
his
room
at
one
of
the
hotels
in
a
few
minutes
wine
and
cigars
were
ordered
and
the
three
spent
an
hour
or
so
in
drinking
smoking
and
of
no
elevating
or
refined
character
come
let
us
have
a
game
of
cards
the
friend
at
last
remarked
during
a
pause
in
the
conversation
at
the
same
time
going
to
his
trunk
and
producing
a
pack
of
cards
no
objection
responded
boyd
you
take
a
hand
of
course
the
new
friend
said
looking
at
thomas
howland
but
thomas
said
that
he
knew
nothing
of
cards
o
that
no
matter
you
can
learn
in
two
minutes
responded
the
friend
of
boyd
young
howland
felt
reluctant
but
he
could
not
resist
the
influence
that
was
around
him
and
so
he
consented
to
finger
the
cards
with
the
rest
as
they
gathered
around
the
table
a
was
laid
down
by
each
of
the
young
men
who
looked
towards
thomas
as
they
did
so
i
can
not
play
for
money
he
said
coloring
for
he
felt
really
ashamed
to
acknowledge
his
scruples
and
why
not
asked
the
friend
of
boyd
looking
him
steadily
in
the
face
because
i
think
it
wrong
stammered
out
howland
coloring
still
more
deeply
nonsense
is
your
money
your
own
and
pray
what
harm
is
there
in
your
doing
with
your
own
as
you
please
urged
the
tempter
but
i
do
not
know
enough
of
the
game
to
risk
my
money
you
do
think
we
would
take
advantage
of
your
ignorance
boyd
said
the
stake
is
only
to
give
interest
to
the
game
i
would
not
give
a
copper
for
a
game
of
cards
without
a
stake
come
put
down
your
and
we
promise
to
pay
you
back
all
you
loose
if
you
wish
it
until
you
acquire
some
skill
but
thomas
felt
reluctant
and
hesitated
nevertheless
he
was
debating
the
matter
in
his
mind
seriously
and
every
moment
that
reluctance
was
growing
weaker
will
you
play
boyd
asked
in
a
decided
tone
breaking
in
upon
his
debate
i
had
rather
not
thomas
replied
attempting
to
smile
so
as
to
conciliate
his
false
friends
you
afraid
of
your
money
said
boyd
in
a
tone
it
is
not
that
boyd
then
what
is
it
pray
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
right
this
was
answered
by
a
loud
laugh
from
his
two
friends
which
touched
thomas
a
good
deal
and
made
him
feel
more
ashamed
of
the
scruples
that
held
him
back
from
entering
into
the
temptation
come
down
with
your
stake
howland
boyd
said
after
he
had
finished
his
laugh
the
hand
of
thomas
was
in
his
pocket
and
his
fingers
had
grasped
the
silver
coin
yet
still
he
hesitated
will
you
play
or
not
the
friend
of
boyd
now
said
with
something
of
impatience
in
his
tone
say
yes
or
no
for
a
moment
the
mind
of
thomas
became
confused
then
the
perception
came
upon
him
as
clear
as
a
sunbeam
that
it
was
wrong
to
gamble
he
remembered
too
vividly
his
father
parting
injunction
he
said
firmly
and
decidedly
both
of
his
companions
looked
disappointed
and
angry
what
did
you
bring
him
for
he
heard
boyd
companion
say
to
him
in
an
under
tone
while
a
frown
darkened
upon
his
brow
the
reply
did
not
reach
his
ear
but
he
felt
that
his
company
was
no
longer
pleasant
and
rising
he
bade
them
a
formal
and
hurriedly
retired
that
little
word
had
saved
him
the
scheme
was
to
win
from
him
his
forty
dollars
and
then
involve
him
in
debts
of
honor
as
they
are
falsely
called
which
would
compel
him
to
draw
upon
his
father
for
more
money
or
abstract
it
from
his
employer
a
system
which
had
been
pursued
by
boyd
and
which
was
discovered
only
a
week
subsequent
when
the
young
man
was
discharged
in
disgrace
it
then
came
out
that
he
had
been
for
months
in
secret
association
with
a
gambler
and
that
the
two
shared
together
the
spoils
and
peculations
this
incident
roused
thomas
howland
to
a
distinct
consciousness
of
the
danger
that
lurked
in
his
path
as
a
young
man
in
a
large
city
he
felt
as
he
had
not
felt
while
simply
listening
to
his
father
precept
the
value
of
the
word
and
resolved
that
hereafter
he
would
utter
that
little
word
and
that
too
decidedly
whenever
urged
to
do
what
his
judgment
did
not
approve
i
will
be
free
he
said
pacing
his
chamber
backward
and
forward
i
will
be
free
hereafter
no
one
shall
persuade
me
or
drive
me
to
do
what
i
feel
to
be
wrong
that
conclusion
was
his
safeguard
ever
after
when
tempted
and
he
was
tempted
frequently
his
decided
the
matter
at
once
there
was
a
power
in
it
that
was
in
resisting
evil
willy
and
the
beggar
girl

apple

willy

a
feeling

joy
to
the
heart
of
a

and
then

raised
my
mother

sick
for
a
great
many
days
so
sick
she
do
know

sobs
stifled
the
rest
and
heaved
with
young
sorrow
that
innocent
breast
just
then
from
the
where
wee
willy
run
as
his
mother
to
question
the
poor
child
begun
came
forth
the
sweet

tiny
hands

he
cried
as
he
laid
the
great
loaf
at
her
feet
the
mother
smiled
gently
then
quick
through
the
door
drew
the
sad
little
stranger
so
hungry
and
poor
with
words
kindly
spoken
she
gave
her
nice
food
and
clothed
her
with
garments
all
clean
warm
and
good
this
done
she
was
leading
her
out
when
she
heard
willy
coming
down
stairs
like
a
fluttering
bird
a
newly
bought
leghorn
with
green
bow
and
band
and
an
old
worn
out
beaver
he
held
in
his
hand
here
give
her
my
new
hat
he
cried

black
one

wo
care
say
will
you
dear
mother
first
out
through
the
door
she
passed
the
girl
kindly
then
quick
from
the
floor
caught
up
the
dear
fellow
kissed
and
kissed
him
again
while
her
glad
tears
fell
freely
his
sweet
face
like
rain
the
good
son
little
martin
went
to
a
peasant
and
endeavored
to
procure
employment
by
which
he
might
be
able
to
earn
some
money
yes
said
the
peasant
i
will
take

a

if
you
are
industrious
will
give
you
your
board
and
ten
dollars
for
the
whole
summer
i
will
be
very
industrious
said
martin
but
i
beg
you
to
pay
me
my
wages
every
week
for
i
have
a
poor
father
at
home
to
whom
i
wish
to
carry
all
i
earn
the
peasant
who
was
pleased
beyond
measure
at
this
filial
love
not
only
willingly
consented
but
also
raised
his
wages
much
higher
every
saturday
the
son
carefully
carried
his
money
and
as
much
bread
and
butter
as
he
could
spare
from
his
own
mouth
to
his
father
children
love
and
gratitude
always
please
the
wise
and
good
but
contempt
and
hate
from
all
on
the
thankless
child
will
fall
the
sick
mother
a
mother
once
lay
very
sick
and
suffered
great
and
constant
pain
her
children
were
all
very
sad
and
melancholy
and
the
large
ones
often
kneeled
down
together
and
prayed
that
god
would
restore
their
mother
to
health
once
more
the
youngest
child
would
stand
all
day
by
the
bed
of
her
mother
and
with
tearful
eyes
anxiously
inquire
when
she
would
be
well
and
get
up
again
one
day
this
little
child
observed
a
glass
filled
with
some
dark
fluid
standing
by
the
sick
bed
and
asked
mother
what
is
this
the
mother
answered
my
dear
child
it
is
something
very
bitter
but
i
must
drink
it
that
i
may
get
well
again
mother
said
the
good
child
if
it
is
so
bitter
i
will
drink
it
for
you
then
you
will
be
well
again
illustration
and
the
sick
mother
in
all
her
pains
had
the
comfort
and
consolation
of
seeing
how
dearly
all
her
children
loved
her
parents
joy
and
comfort
find
in
a
child
that
is
good
and
kind
but
their
hearts
are
very
sad
when
the
child
they
love
is
bad
cornelia
prayer
cornelia
was
the
joy
and
pride
of
her
parents
for
she
was
a
slender
graceful
little
creature
darting
about
like
a
young
fawn
and
her
cheeks
were
as
fresh
and
blooming
as
the
young
rose
when
it
first
opens
to
receive
the
dew
added
to
this
she
was
blessed
with
a
temper
as
sweet
and
serene
as
a
spring
morning
when
it
dawns
upon
the
blooming
valleys
announcing
a
fair
and
delightful
day
cornelia
had
never
in
her
life
known
what
it
is
to
experience
trouble
and
anxiety
for
her
youth
had
been
all
brightness
and
sunshine
but
such
freedom
from
all
trials
does
not
generally
continue
for
a
long
time
uninterrupted
and
so
it
was
with
cornelia
she
was
one
day
very
much
delighted
at
being
shown
a
little
brother
with
which
her
mother
had
presented
her
but
her
joy
was
soon
clouded
by
the
severe
illness
of
that
mother
she
lay
many
long
days
without
noticing
or
appearing
to
know
her
little
cornelia
for
her
fever
was
strong
and
her
senses
were
continually
wandering
cornelia
was
almost
at
this
and
they
could
scarcely
persuade
her
to
leave
the
bedside
of
her
dear
mother
for
a
single
moment
she
would
entreat
and
implore
until
she
won
their
consent
that
she
should
remain
in
the
sick
room
and
then
all
night
long
would
the
affectionate
little
girl
watch
by
her
mother
bed
and
attentively
study
her
every
want
wetting
her
parched
lips
and
moving
around
her
with
the
lightest
and
most
anxious
footsteps
on
the
seventh
day
of
her
sickness
the
fever
approached
its
crisis
and
there
was
deep
silence
in
the
little
chamber
and
stifled
weeping
for
every
one
thought
that
death
was
near
but
with
the
night
came
long
absent
slumber
and
revived
the
almost
dying
mother
and
seemed
to
give
her
back
to
life
what
a
season
for
cornelia
through
the
whole
night
she
sat
by
the
bed
listening
to
her
now
soft
and
regular
breathing
while
hope
and
fear
were
struggling
together
in
her
bosom
when
daylight
appeared
the
mother
opened
her
eyes
and
turning
them
upon
the
anxious
cornelia
knew
her
i
am
better
my
child
said
she
in
a
clear
but
feeble
voice
i
am
better
and
shall
get
well
they
then
gave
her
drink
and
nourishment
and
she
went
to
sleep
again
what
joy
was
this
for
the
affectionate
little
girl
her
heart
was
too
full
for
utterance
and
she
stole
softly
out
of
the
chamber
and
skipped
out
into
the
field
and
ascended
a
hill
near
by
just
as
the
sun
was
dawning
here
she
stood
her
hands
clasped
together
and
her
bosom
swelling
with
many
contending
emotions
of
pain
and
hope
presently
the
sun
arose
and
streamed
over
her
face
and
cornelia
thought
of
the
new
life
of
her
mother
after
her
reviving
sleep
and
the
anguish
of
her
own
feelings
but
she
could
not
long
shut
up
the
flood
of
feeling
within
her
own
heart
and
she
knelt
down
upon
blooming
flowers
with
which
the
hill
was
covered
and
bowing
her
face
to
the
fragrant
sod
her
tears
were
mingled
with
the
dew
of
heaven
after
a
few
minutes
silence
she
lifted
up
her
head
and
rising
from
the
ground
returned
to
her
home
and
the
chamber
of
her
mother
never
before
had
there
been
so
sweet
and
calm
a
loveliness
on
the
face
of
cornelia
it
was
a
reflection
of
the
peace
and
tranquility
of
her
soul
for
she
had
held
communion
with
her
god
forgiveness
a
friend
with
whom
i
was
conversing
a
few
weeks
since
told
me
of
a
beautiful
example
of
this
christian
grace
even
in
a
little
child
it
has
often
dwelt
in
my
memory
since
and
perhaps
some
of
my
little
readers
may
be
induced
to
cultivate
the
same
spirit
if
i
repeat
it
to
them
little
sarah
was
a
sweet
child
of
six
summers
gentle
and
affectionate
in
disposition
she
soon
won
a
large
portion
of
that
love
which
few
hearts
can
withhold
from
the
happy
spirit
of
infancy
it
has
been
said
childhood
is
ever
lovely
and
i
would
add
childhood
is
ever
loved
sarah
was
an
attentive
and
careful
reader
of
the
word
of
god
at
a
very
early
age
there
it
was
that
she
found
the
divine
promise
forgive
and
thou
shalt
be
forgiven
and
she
not
only
read
this
precept
but
showed
by
her
life
of
gentle
forgiveness
that
she
had
engraven
it
upon
her
heart
illustration
she
attended
a
small
school
which
was
kept
near
her
home
and
i
am
sorry
that
all
who
were
her
schoolmates
had
not
the
same
kind
spirit
there
were
some
who
were
very
rude
and
unkind
and
sarah
soon
found
many
trials
to
encounter
often
would
the
gentle
child
return
to
her
sweet
home
in
tears
to
forget
her
sorrow
in
a
mother
love
yet
every
harsh
and
ungentle
tone
was
forgiven
by
her
for
she
knew
that
forgiveness
was
of
heaven
one
day
when
her
mother
had
given
her
some
plums
she
observed
that
sarah
did
not
eat
them
but
put
them
all
into
her
little
workbag
to
carry
them
to
school
why
do
you
do
so
said
she
you
do
not
eat
the
plums
which
i
have
given
you
no
mother
said
sarah
i
will
carry
them
to
the
little
children
who
do
not
love
me
perhaps
they
will
love
me
better
if
i
am
kind
to
them
here
was
the
true
secret
of
human
love
the
power
of
kindness
there
is
none
other
that
will
reach
every
heart
there
is
none
other
that
can
influence
them
for
good
it
can
lead
the
sinner
from
his
evil
way
for
none
are
too
sinful
to
love
and
where
love
is
there
is
power
we
are
all
frail
and
erring
beings
whose
hourly
prayer
should
be
for
pardon
and
shall
we
not
forgive
the
guilty
conscience
a
mother
one
day
returned
home
very
sorrowful
and
lamented
bitterly
to
her
husband
that
she
had
heard
that
one
of
their
sons
had
beaten
a
poor
child
this
said
she
must
have
certainly
been
done
by
our
naughty
caspar
but
he
will
deny
it
if
i
put
the
question
to
him
i
will
answer
for
it
said
the
prudent
father
that
i
will
put
the
question
to
him
in
a
way
in
which
he
can
not
answer
with
a
lie
and
thereby
come
at
the
truth
they
soon
after
went
to
the
supper
table
and
caspar
was
very
still
and
quiet
he
ate
little
and
spoke
still
less
he
seldom
looked
at
his
parents
who
were
very
grave
and
serious
and
then
only
with
stolen
glances
the
sons
soon
after
went
to
they
all
slept
in
separate
beds
but
in
the
same
room
about
half
an
hour
after
when
they
were
gone
to
sleep
their
father
entered
the
chamber
and
took
pains
to
make
a
great
noise
in
shutting
the
door
caspar
instantly
sprang
out
of
bed
and
full
of
fear
cried
out
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
nothing
answered
the
father
i
was
only
wishing
to
see
who
among
you
was
asleep
the
two
other
brothers
were
sleeping
softly
and
sweetly
and
did
not
awake
until
they
were
aroused
by
caspar
cry
the
father
then
went
out
again
the
next
day
the
father
called
caspar
to
him
and
before
his
mother
and
all
the
children
said
to
him
you
beat
a
poor
child
yesterday
did
you
caspar
who
thought
that
it
had
all
come
out
began
to
excuse
he
struck
me
too
and
his
father
would
not
suffer
him
to
proceed
any
farther
caspar
said
he
why
do
you
make
us
so
much
trouble
and
sorrow
yesterday
we
heard
that
one
of
our
sons
had
beaten
a
poor
child
but
we
did
not
then
know
who
had
done
it
but
when
i
saw
you
eating
in
so
much
fear
and
trouble
and
still
more
when
you
could
not
sleep
from
uneasiness
and
your
drove
you
from
your
bed
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
door
i
was
convinced
that
you
were
the
guilty
one
see
how
miserable
wickedness
can
make
us
you
have
been
sufficiently
punished
by
your
anxiety
and
fear
but
you
must
now
endeavor
to
do
some
good
to
the
poor
child
and
make
atonement
for
your
faults
what
will
you
do
caspar
acknowledged
his
fault
and
promised
to
do
every
thing
that
his
father
commanded
him
he
who
does
wrong
is
always
sure
to
repent
of
it
for
he
is
punished
by
his
own
conscience
if
in
no
other
way
acorn
hollow
oh
aunt

with
us
and

merry
elves
oh
my
foot
oh
my
hand
i
would
rather
tell
you
all
the
stories
in
the
arabian
nights
than
go
through
one
such
dance
as
this
sit
down
now
and
be
quiet
for
if
i
have
really
got
it
to
do
i
want
to
begin
as
soon
as
possible
well
what
shall
i
tell
you
about
janie
oh
anything
you
please
illustration
there
now
that
is
any
sort
of
an
answer
at
all
what
shall
i
tell
you
about
thanny
oh
tell
us
about
a
sailor
boy
who
wore
a
tarpaulin
hat
and
a
blue
jacket
with
a
collar
to
it
and
how
he
went
to
sea
and
got
shipwrecked
on
an
uninhabited
desert
island
and
got
drowned
but
quite
and
then
after
a
great
many
years
he
came
home
one
night
and
knocked
at
the
door
with
a
bag
full
of
dollars
and
a
bunch
of
cocoa
nuts
and
his
old
father
and
mother
almost
died
of
joy
to
see
him
well
done
but
now
that
you
know
the
whole
of
the
story
it
wont
be
of
any
use
for
me
to
tell
it
over
again
what
shall
i
tell
you
about
nelly
tell
us
about
something
you
used
to
do
when
you
was
a
little
girl
when
i
was
a
little
girl
ah
yes
do
you
know
that
i
used
to
be
a
wild
and
careless
creature
and
did
many
things
which
i
am
sorry
for
now
i
would
often
act
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
therefore
i
said
many
vain
and
foolish
words
and
though
i
did
not
intend
evil
yet
i
often
committed
thoughtless
acts
which
were
in
themselves
very
wrong
i
did
not
restrain
that
spirit
as
i
ought
to
so
it
grew
upon
me
until
it
almost
became
a
part
of
my
nature
and
now
that
i
have
grown
up
to
be
a
woman
and
people
expect
better
things
of
me
a
word
a
thought
or
look
will
call
forth
those
feelings
once
more
even
at
times
of
the
most
serious
reflection
and
then
many
call
me
and
trifling
i
do
not
blame
them
but
in
my
heart
i
do
not
feel
so
take
care
of
yourselves
in
time
that
you
may
not
have
these
sorrowful
fruits
to
repent
of
but
i
do
not
mean
to
preach
you
a
sermon
instead
of
telling
a
story
and
now
that
you
have
reminded
me
of
my
earlier
days
i
will
tell
you
about
a
place
called
acorn
hollow
for
of
all
the
spots
that
i
love
to
remember
this
is
one
of
the
dearest
to
me
where
is
it
aunt
lissa
it
is
about
two
miles
from
your
grandfather
house
in
the
woods
at
the
south
part
of
the
town
i
have
visited
it
at
all
times
and
seasons
of
the
year
but
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
it
was
in
the
dead
of
winter
why
how
happened
that
it
was
the
of
december
the
anniversary
of
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
and
there
was
to
be
a
grand
entertainment
in
the
evening
to
which
my
older
sisters
were
invited
they
wanted
some
of
the
curly
ground
pine
which
keeps
green
all
winter
to
put
with
the
flowers
they
wore
in
their
hair
and
as
brother
alfred
was
always
famous
for
knowing
the
whereabouts
of
all
strange
plants
and
wild
flowers
he
promised
to
get
them
some
in
the
afternoon
freddy
lucas
his
friend
and
almost
constant
companion
came
and
as
it
was
an
uncommonly
mild
and
pleasant
day
for
that
season
of
the
year
they
asked
me
to
go
with
them
i
was
right
glad
to
do
so
and
after
adding
one
more
to
our
party
susan
edwards
a
girl
we
were
soon
scampering
away
over
the
hills
there
had
been
some
very
heavy
rains
by
which
the
sand
had
been
washed
away
from
the
leaving
deep
and
wide
furrows
at
the
foot
which
required
all
our
skill
to
jump
over
but
we
determined
not
to
be
outdone
by
alfred
who
acted
as
pioneer
so
we
continued
to
follow
our
leader
with
many
a
laugh
and
tumble
until
it
seemed
we
were
going
a
great
way
to
get
nowhere
at
length
we
came
to
a
little
pond
far
down
among
the
hills
with
shrubs
and
rushes
growing
all
around
and
into
it
alfred
said
this
was
turtle
pond
where
the
boys
often
came
saturday
afternoons
to
roast
potatoes
and
apples
and
have
a
real
frolic
he
said
too
it
would
do
one
heart
good
to
look
upon
these
hills
in
the
early
spring
time
for
then
they
were
fairly
blushing
with
the
beautiful
may
flowers
which
the
boys
and
girls
who
are
working
for
the
cause
take
so
much
pains
to
gather
and
send
to
the
boston
market
i
asked
him
if
this
was
acorn
hollow
no
said
he
must
go
through
this
pasture
and
the
next
one
beyond
it
then
we
shall
see
a
cedar
tree
growing
by
the
fence
and
soon
we
shall
come
to
a
place
where
two
roads
go
round
a
hill
and
then
we
shall
be
close
by
there
so
we
went
and
went
till
he
stopped
suddenly
and
said
it
is
and
sure
enough
there
was
the
beautiful
hollow
close
by
the
the
sides
were
so
steep
that
it
was
by
no
means
safe
to
run
down
into
it
and
the
great
oak
trees
and
the
small
ones
with
the
pine
the
walnut
and
the
silvery
birch
grew
thick
and
close
all
around
save
that
one
small
opening
from
the
road
a
little
archway
among
the
overhanging
boughs
and
dwarf
alders
just
below
this
opening
there
was
one
of
the
most
lordly
looking
oak
trees
that
i
ever
saw
it
was
taller
than
any
of
the
other
trees
and
the
trunk
was
so
large
that
when
two
of
us
children
stood
one
on
each
side
and
reached
our
arms
around
it
we
could
only
touch
the
tips
of
each
other
fingers
we
had
to
hurry
and
get
our
ground
pine
for
the
days
were
very
short
and
it
grew
dark
fast
there
was
plenty
of
it
growing
under
the
trees
with
another
evergreen
which
ran
close
to
the
ground
in
long
vines
with
little
soft
narrow
leaves
which
felt
like
fur
the
boys
called
it
bear
grass
i
do
think
that
was
the
right
name
but
i
never
knew
any
other
after
we
had
trimmed
up
our
caps
and
bonnets
with
the
early
leaves
of
pine
and
made
ourselves
tippets
of
the
bear
grass
we
hastened
back
again
but
the
stars
were
in
the
sky
and
the
gurnet
lights
were
beaming
brightly
over
the
waters
long
before
we
reached
our
homes
after
this
we
went
there
a
great
many
times
for
we
were
fond
of
rambling
in
the
woods
and
almost
everything
which
is
usually
found
on
hilltop
or
valley
seemed
to
grow
there
there
were
may
flowers
violets
and
anemonies
in
spring
time
box
whortle
and
black
berries
in
summer
and
acorns
and
walnuts
in
autumn
one
fourth
of
july
when
soldiers
were
marching
about
the
streets
boys
were
firing
crackers
dogs
barking
and
every
body
seemed
just
ready
to
run
crazy
alfred
and
charlie
who
was
but
a
bit
of
a
boy
then
with
sister
una
and
myself
determined
to
make
our
escape
from
this
scene
of
confusion
we
took
a
little
basket
of
provision
with
a
hatchet
and
a
jug
of
water
and
started
for
our
favorite
hollow
often
in
the
long
winter
evenings
we
brothers
and
sisters
would
sit
round
the
fire
and
tell
what
we
would
do
when
we
grew
up
to
be
men
and
women
but
there
was
one
thing
which
we
always
agreed
upon
and
it
was
this
that
we
would
all
live
together
in
a
little
cottage
in
the
woods
where
we
could
have
plenty
of
room
to
move
about
in
and
do
just
as
we
pleased
now
we
thought
we
had
dreamed
of
this
long
enough
and
we
determined
to
have
a
little
of
the
reality
so
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
hollow
we
began
to
build
a
bower
with
the
branches
which
we
cut
from
the
trees
with
our
hatchet
we
worked
away
very
busily
for
a
long
time
toiling
and
sweating
yet
all
the
time
feeling
never
so
happy
oh
i
do
wish
that
all
you
children
and
a
great
many
more
beside
could
have
been
there
with
us
to
see
what
a
nice
pretty
place
it
was
when
it
was
finished
hiram
of
tyre
in
his
stately
palace
of
cedar
fir
and
algum
wood
could
not
have
felt
prouder
or
happier
than
we
did
in
our
little
sylvan
bower
we
spread
a
shawl
on
the
ground
and
laid
our
provisions
upon
it
here
we
sat
and
sung
and
told
stories
till
we
saw
a
great
dark
shadow
coming
down
the
and
what
do
you
suppose
it
was
thanny
well
i
do
know
unless
it
was
a
great
black
bear
coming
down
to
get
some
of
his
grass
for
supper
oh
fie
no
what
do
you
think
it
was
nelly
was
it
old
pan
and
sylvanus
who
were
astonished
to
hear
such
a
noise
in
their
woods
no
you
have
got
it
right
either
what
do
you
say
janie
well
i
guess
it
was
the
shadows
of
evening
coming
down
the
that
it
and
we
were
very
much
surprised
to
find
it
so
for
the
time
had
passed
very
quickly
and
pleasantly
we
gathered
up
our
things
and
started
for
home
but
first
we
stopped
under
the
old
and
sung
song
to
the
oak
the
brave
old
oak
we
did
know
the
right
tune
and
so
we
sung
it
to
the
air
of
is
nae
luck
about
the
house
it
was
the
music
we
cared
so
much
about
as
the
beautiful
words
they
were
so
pretty
and
appropriate
well
we
did
not
go
into
the
woods
much
after
this
for
we
had
a
great
many
other
things
to
take
up
our
minds
charlie
and
i
went
to
school
and
father
needed
alfred
to
help
him
all
the
time
i
have
told
you
how
we
found
the
hollow
and
how
much
we
enjoyed
ourselves
there
now
i
will
tell
you
what
became
of
it
what
became
of
it
why
did
it
catch
afire
and
burn
up
no
did
it
blow
away
in
a
strong
north
wind
no
did
it
get
filled
up
with
dust
and
dry
leaves
or
did
you
forget
the
way
there
and
never
find
it
again
what
become
of
it
well
let
me
tell
you
it
was
one
of
those
beautiful
spring
days
when
we
feel
that
we
can
not
possibly
stay
at
home
and
our
feet
will
run
away
with
us
in
spite
of
ourselves
that
the
old
spirit
and
desire
for
rambling
came
over
us
once
more
and
away
we
started
for
the
woods
way
will
you
go
said
alfred
as
we
stopped
at
a
place
where
two
roads
led
in
different
directions
hollow
was
the
answer
of
all
and
accordingly
we
went
that
way
but
oh
wonder
of
wonders
how
we
stood
by
the
once
loved
spot
and
stared
at
each
other
and
rubbed
our
eyes
and
looked
again
and
again
where
were
the
beautiful
trees
that
grew
so
closely
side
by
side
intermingling
their
foliage
and
locking
their
arms
together
like
loving
brothers
and
sisters
where
was
the
old
oak
that
had
stood
there
with
his
broad
green
arms
outstretched
and
shook
his
myriad
leaves
whenever
we
came
as
if
he
loved
us
children
and
welcomed
us
to
a
in
his
shadow
and
where
was
the
soft
green
carpet
of
moss
and
tender
grass
that
was
spread
out
so
beautifully
at
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
it
was
all
changed
as
if
the
breath
of
an
evil
spirit
had
blown
upon
it
it
too
bad
we
all
exclaimed
and
after
we
had
given
expression
to
our
feelings
by
these
few
words
we
proceeded
to
a
closer
examination
all
the
trees
along
the
had
been
cut
down
and
little
piles
of
wood
were
put
up
to
carry
away
the
may
flowers
were
all
dried
up
in
the
sun
and
the
ground
pine
and
bear
grass
were
as
sere
and
yellow
as
the
autumn
leaves
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
the
turf
had
been
cut
up
and
carried
off
and
there
lay
the
bones
of
an
old
horse
bleaching
in
the
sun
there
was
only
a
little
stump
left
of
the
acorn
tree
with
a
few
withered
branches
it
a
sin
and
a
shame
said
alfred
indignantly
never
want
to
come
here
again
murmured
charlie
and
i
sat
down
on
the
stump
and
cried
if
all
the
world
had
been
looking
at
me
i
could
have
helped
it
then
i
thought
how
strangely
everything
was
changing
around
me
nothing
appeared
the
same
to
me
save
the
sun
and
stars
and
the
broad
blue
sea
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sisters
and
the
great
world
itself
were
all
changing
i
too
was
changed
time
and
study
with
daily
trial
were
making
me
an
altogether
different
being
from
what
i
had
been
and
i
knew
that
the
finger
of
the
almighty
was
writing
lessons
upon
my
heart
which
i
could
never
forget
no
not
through
all
eternity
i
wept
and
then
a
truth
a
great
and
a
good
one
rose
in
my
heart
like
the
morning
star
for
i
knew
at
that
moment
that
all
these
changes
were
but
the
lessons
which
the
angel
teachers
are
giving
us
to
fit
us
for
higher
duties
in
the
world
to
come
the
memory
of
that
beautiful
spot
is
as
fresh
and
fair
in
my
heart
as
ever
and
the
lesson
which
i
learned
there
has
had
a
blessed
influence
upon
my
life
for
now
when
i
feel
sad
and
disheartened
i
strive
to
keep
my
eye
fixed
on
the
great
point
to
which
we
all
tend
forgetting
the
little
sorrows
that
lie
between
and
i
hear
the
calm
sweet
voice
of
him
who
died
on
calvary
saying
not
i
am
thy
friend
and
brother
i
too
have
dwelt
in
the
flesh
and
know
its
conflicts
and
trials
trust
in
me
for
i
am
the
same
yesterday
and
forever
hark
do
i
hear
the
clock
strike
eight
nine
ten
o
naughty
children
when
i
only
came
in
here
to
stop
ten
minutes
and
now
you
have
kept
me
here
till
ten
only
think
how
dark
it
is
and
what
a
long
way
over
to
the
green
i
guess
you
will
be
sorry
if
you
should
hear
in
the
morning
that
i
had
walked
off
the
bridge
into
the
or
fallen
into
the
cistern
on
the
green
oh
aunt
lissa
as
if
there
was
any
fence
to
the
bridge
and
a
cover
on
the
cistern
with
a
stone
on
it
you
need
try
to
frighten
us
in
that
way
well
then
let
me
go
lest
grandmother
should
feel
frightened
but
first
you
must
pay
me
for
telling
you
a
story
well
how
much
do
you
ask
oh
not
much
only
a
kiss
from
each
of
you
that
you
may
have
and
welcome
and
as
many
as
you
please
good
night
industry
and
idleness
the
necessity
of
cultivating
industrious
habits
in
early
youth
was
never
more
fully
exemplified
than
in
the
case
of
two
girls
daughters
of
the
same
mother
who
were
born
in
a
village
about
forty
miles
from
the
city
of
boston
illustration
mary
and
sophia
had
the
advantage
of
a
mother
who
was
herself
full
of
enterprise
and
energy
and
who
having
been
left
a
widow
and
knowing
that
the
success
of
her
children
depended
mainly
on
their
own
conduct
strove
to
bring
them
up
to
habits
of
industry
sophia
the
younger
of
the
two
sisters
inherited
much
of
her
mother
tact
and
vivacity
when
the
elder
persons
of
the
family
were
engaged
in
any
domestic
employment
she
delighted
to
watch
their
movements
and
they
being
pleased
with
this
mark
of
early
promise
never
failed
to
instruct
her
in
the
duties
of
a
housewife
she
learned
rapidly
under
their
tuition
and
as
she
never
thought
she
knew
too
much
to
learn
she
thrived
greatly
so
that
when
she
became
old
enough
to
be
married
she
was
fully
acquainted
with
all
the
branches
of
domestic
business
she
knew
what
implements
to
use
and
she
had
a
dexterous
way
of
using
them
which
not
only
helped
to
forward
the
business
of
the
day
but
also
gave
much
pleasure
to
those
persons
who
saw
with
what
grace
and
ease
she
performed
her
labor
she
married
a
worthy
young
man
who
never
ceased
to
admire
her
because
his
house
was
always
in
order
his
meals
were
on
the
table
at
the
exact
hour
and
her
dress
was
always
arranged
with
a
regard
to
neatness
and
to
beauty
and
the
most
perfect
cleanliness
reigned
from
one
end
of
the
house
to
the
other
with
regard
to
her
sister
mary
i
regret
that
i
have
too
much
reason
to
speak
otherwise
although
mary
knew
very
well
that
her
fortune
for
good
or
for
evil
depended
wholly
upon
herself
yet
she
thought
it
unnecessary
to
take
any
pains
to
acquire
industrious
habits
or
to
learn
the
business
of
housekeeping
while
she
was
yet
a
very
little
girl
she
was
obstinate
and
and
thought
herself
too
good
to
work
or
to
learn
any
useful
art
while
the
rest
of
the
family
were
engaged
in
necessary
labor
she
was
amusing
herself
and
if
called
upon
to
do
the
least
thing
she
complained
bitterly
as
if
some
great
injury
had
been
done
to
her
she
thought
it
very
much
beneath
her
to
learn
to
sew
or
to
make
bread
or
to
milk
one
of
the
cows
and
could
talk
half
an
hour
and
make
very
fine
excuses
in
order
to
get
rid
of
any
such
little
exercise
when
she
was
twelve
years
old
she
supposed
that
she
was
born
to
be
a
lady
and
she
took
this
notion
into
her
head
merely
because
she
did
not
know
how
to
do
a
single
useful
thing
if
her
mother
or
sisters
said
anything
to
her
about
her
dress
which
was
never
put
on
as
it
should
be
or
about
her
hair
which
was
never
done
up
neatly
she
flouted
at
them
with
disdain
and
said
that
clothes
did
not
make
the
woman
which
was
very
true
of
itself
but
nevertheless
neatness
in
dress
is
always
required
to
make
a
respectable
woman
one
may
be
ever
so
poor
and
may
have
ever
so
little
clothing
but
one
can
always
tell
by
a
appearance
what
is
to
be
laid
to
the
account
of
poverty
and
what
is
to
be
laid
to
the
account
of
sluttishness
mary
grew
up
in
this
way
and
as
she
did
not
improve
herself
by
useful
occupation
she
found
other
employments
which
did
her
no
good
she
read
every
foolish
and
extravagant
story
and
novel
which
give
false
ideas
of
life
and
which
poison
the
mind
by
unreasonable
views
of
love
and
of
married
life
she
now
thought
that
she
was
becoming
very
accomplished
but
no
young
man
who
knew
her
history
desired
to
unite
himself
with
such
a
partner
at
last
however
a
stranger
who
entirely
misapprehended
her
character
offered
her
his
hand
and
she
professed
to
love
him
very
much
but
her
professions
were
all
frothy
and
vain
for
she
had
read
so
many
extravagant
fictions
and
knew
so
little
of
real
life
that
she
did
not
know
her
own
mind
and
supposed
that
she
was
very
much
in
love
when
she
did
not
even
know
how
to
form
a
serious
attachment
the
man
whom
she
married
was
very
respectable
and
well
disposed
and
if
he
had
married
a
smart
and
industrious
woman
would
have
succeeded
well
in
the
world
but
mary
had
never
been
either
smart
or
industrious
and
she
seemed
to
suppose
that
now
she
was
married
there
was
no
necessity
for
doing
anything
when
her
husband
complained
that
it
was
hard
to
live
she
only
smiled
and
said
that
she
knew
if
she
were
a
man
she
could
get
along
well
enough
and
that
every
man
ought
to
expect
as
a
matter
of
course
to
support
his
family
such
talk
as
this
did
not
comfort
him
as
he
was
daily
laboring
very
hard
to
maintain
his
family
for
his
wife
had
one
daughter
and
he
thought
that
his
companion
ought
to
take
an
interest
in
his
misfortunes
but
she
had
no
regard
for
the
cares
and
troubles
of
her
husband
she
thought
that
it
was
bad
enough
for
her
to
be
debarred
from
riding
in
a
coach
and
putting
on
rich
clothing
and
she
often
complained
that
she
could
not
lead
the
life
of
a
lady
as
their
family
increased
her
husband
found
that
she
possessed
no
tact
at
all
he
would
have
hired
a
housekeeper
had
he
been
able
in
order
that
his
wife
might
lounge
about
and
read
novels
all
day
he
would
also
have
employed
some
person
to
dress
her
as
her
clothing
was
always
put
on
in
so
negligent
a
manner
that
he
was
ashamed
to
invite
a
friend
to
his
house
but
mary
imagined
that
she
had
a
very
hard
time
because
she
could
not
be
a
lady
and
she
associated
with
some
idle
gossipping
women
who
encouraged
her
to
find
fault
with
her
husband
because
he
could
not
put
her
into
a
palace
her
husband
never
could
have
his
meals
ready
betimes
and
when
he
went
home
to
his
dinner
the
breakfast
dishes
were
found
still
unwashed
upon
the
table
mary
children
were
pretty
and
healthy
but
having
been
always
allowed
to
go
dirty
and
ragged
they
were
treated
with
contempt
by
all
decent
children
these
things
wore
upon
her
husband
mind
more
and
more
until
he
left
his
family
in
despair
and
never
returned
to
them
again
mary
is
now
in
the
poor
house
for
being
too
idle
to
work
and
never
having
learned
how
to
support
herself
it
could
not
be
expected
that
she
should
provide
honestly
for
her
family
nobody
pities
her
and
there
are
many
who
ask
her
how
she
likes
being
a
lady
and
who
joke
her
about
riding
in
her
coach
such
is
the
fatal
effect
of
forming
idle
habits
early
in
life
envy
i
once
knew
two
little
girls
who
attended
the
same
school
and
occupied
the
same
bench
yet
who
were
entirely
unlike
each
other
in
disposition
so
that
while
martha
was
beloved
by
all
who
knew
her
mary
was
as
generally
disliked
martha
was
gentle
kind
and
affectionate
but
mary
was
of
a
very
different
spirit
her
chief
fault
was
and
so
much
did
she
indulge
this
base
passion
that
she
was
unhappy
whenever
she
heard
one
of
her
little
praised
she
was
very
unkind
to
martha
for
she
envied
her
the
ease
with
which
her
lessons
were
committed
to
memory
and
more
than
all
else
she
envied
her
the
love
of
her
kind
teacher
therefore
she
wished
to
injure
martha
and
to
take
away
that
love
one
day
mary
being
according
to
her
usual
custom
idle
amused
herself
with
tearing
and
defacing
her
books
after
spending
some
time
in
this
manner
she
took
them
to
her
teacher
and
with
many
loud
complaints
told
her
that
martha
had
thus
injured
them
she
hoped
that
martha
would
have
been
punished
and
that
her
would
not
love
her
so
well
but
would
believe
that
she
had
done
so
wrong
an
action
but
it
was
not
so
the
teacher
did
not
believe
mary
complaint
and
when
martha
said
she
was
innocent
she
knew
that
it
was
so
for
truth
was
in
her
heart
then
one
of
the
little
girls
said
that
she
had
seen
mary
herself
injuring
the
books
and
the
wicked
child
was
defeated
in
the
plan
that
she
had
formed
after
this
none
of
the
children
would
talk
or
play
with
mary
and
she
soon
left
the
school
none
regretted
her
absence
for
all
said
what
a
pity
that
so
sweet
a
name
should
be
accompanied
by
so
ungentle
a
spirit
now
this
little
girl
had
many
faults
but
i
think
that
the
one
wherein
she
most
erred
was
envy
we
have
seen
how
this
fault
led
her
to
commit
many
sins
it
led
her
to
unkindness
falsehood
and
disgrace
and
however
trivial
the
circumstance
i
have
related
may
appear
yet
it
early
stamped
upon
my
mind
a
lesson
which
after
years
have
not
effaced
may
it
bear
to
some
young
hearts
the
same
lesson
of
conclusion
and
now
my
dear
readers
we
have
come
to
the
last
page
in
this
little
volume
and
that
its
precepts
may
abide
in
all
your
hearts
is
the
sincere
desire
of
your
friend
uncle
