chapter
paul
grayson
walked
the
city
street
slowly
he
was
sauntering
towards
the
spaceport
but
he
was
in
no
hurry
he
had
allowed
himself
plenty
of
time
to
breathe
the
fresh
spring
air
to
listen
to
the
myriad
of
sounds
made
by
his
fellow
men
and
to
revel
in
the
grand
freedom
that
being
out
in
the
open
gave
him
soon
enough
he
would
be
breathing
canned
air
pungent
with
the
odor
of
compressor
oil
and
the
tang
of
the
greenery
used
to
replenish
the
oxygen
unable
to
walk
freely
more
than
a
few
dozen
steps
and
unable
to
see
what
lies
beyond
his
viewports
occasionally
his
eyes
looked
along
the
low
southern
sky
towards
alpha
centauri
proxima
of
course
could
not
be
resolved
by
the
naked
eye
much
less
the
stinking
little
overheated
mote
that
rotated
about
proxima
obviously
unfit
for
human
life
and
patently
incapable
of
spawning
life
of
its
own
it
was
paul
grayson
destination
and
would
be
his
home
for
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
depending
entirely
upon
whether
things
went
good
or
bad
only
during
the
last
four
out
of
two
thousand
millions
of
years
of
its
life
had
this
planet
been
useful
man
needed
a
place
to
stand
not
to
move
the
earth
with
archimedes
lever
but
to
survey
the
galaxy
proxima
centauri
i
was
the
only
planet
in
the
trinary
and
as
bad
as
it
was
it
was
useful
for
a
space
station
in
an
hour
paul
grayson
would
be
locked
in
a
capsule
of
metal
hurling
himself
through
space
towards
proxima
i
he
was
looking
forward
to
ten
days
cooped
up
in
a
spacecraft
of
the
type
furnished
by
the
bureau
of
astrogation
to
its
engineers
which
was
a
far
cry
from
the
sumptuous
craft
run
by
the
big
brass
his
confines
would
be
lined
with
functional
scientific
equipment
his
air
supply
would
be
medically
acceptable
but
aesthetically
horrible
and
his
vision
limited
to
the
cabin
for
beyond
the
viewports
would
be
only
the
formless
endless
abysmal
blackness
of
absolutely
nothing
while
the
ship
mounted
into
multiples
of
the
speed
of
light
then
days
in
a
building
filled
to
the
dome
with
power
equipment
and
radio
gear
timing
mechanism
and
recorders
and
a
refrigerator
that
struggled
with
the
awesome
heat
poured
into
proxima
i
by
its
luminary
but
which
succeeded
only
in
lowering
the
temperature
to
the
point
where
the
potting
compound
in
the
transformers
did
not
run
out
where
the
calibrating
resistors
would
not
change
their
values
where
the
recording
machines
would
still
make
a
record
and
then
again
more
days
in
the
ship
before
it
returned
to
earth
call
it
thirty
days
and
understand
why
paul
grayson
sauntered
along
killing
time
in
the
fresh
air
before
taking
off
paul
grinned
four
years
ago
he
had
arrived
a
full
hour
early
and
wasted
the
hour
in
the
smelly
ship
instead
of
filling
his
lungs
with
clean
fresh
air
never
again
he
would
arrive
a
full
five
minutes
before
time
he
heard
some
radio
music
its
tone
stripped
of
high
frequencies
from
its
passage
through
the
slit
of
a
window
he
sniffed
the
air
and
laughed
because
someone
was
cooking
corned
beef
and
cabbage
then
he
was
out
of
the
range
of
the
radio
music
paul
liked
music
he
hummed
a
tune
as
he
walked
and
then
as
the
fancy
struck
him
he
started
to
sing
it
was
faint
singing
it
would
not
have
carried
more
than
a
few
feet
but
it
sufficed
for
paul
it
was
a
refrain
from
an
early
ballad
and
round
and
round
go
the
deuterons
round
and
round
the
magnet
swings
them
round
and
round
and
round
go
the
deuterons
smack
in
the
target
goes
the
ion
beam
paul
stopped
his
song
because
the
interesting
click
of
high
heels
on
the
sidewalk
pointed
to
the
approach
of
someone
who
might
view
singing
as
an
indication
of
inebriation
she
was
coming
towards
him
walking
on
the
same
side
of
the
sidewalk
her
step
was
quick
and
lithe
and
the
slight
breeze
outlined
her
frock
against
her
body
revealing
and
at
the
same
time
concealing
just
enough
to
quicken
the
pulse
and
awaken
the
interest
paul
was
thirty
and
unmarried
and
experienced
enough
to
catalogue
her
shrewdly
no
crude
attempt
at
would
work
on
this
woman
she
was
sure
of
herself
and
obviously
could
not
want
for
admirers
it
would
take
careful
strategy
over
a
period
of
time
to
get
to
first
base
with
a
woman
like
her
an
inept
campaigner
would
be
called
out
on
strikes
and
paul
grayson
had
to
be
on
the
way
to
centauri
within
the
hour
which
automatically
eliminated
the
initial
step
in
any
plausible
scheme
to
wrangle
an
introduction
paul
grayson
grinned
ruefully
it
seemed
to
him
that
when
he
had
hours
to
spend
and
nothing
to
do
the
streets
were
barren
of
presentable
women
while
the
most
interesting
specimens
of
womanhood
smiled
and
offered
their
charms
when
he
was
en
route
towards
some
schedule
that
could
not
be
delayed
this
was
woman
enough
to
make
a
man
forget
his
timetables
almost
she
came
forward
her
face
lighted
by
the
street
lamp
that
paul
had
just
passed
and
her
hurried
route
was
on
collision
course
with
his
and
with
a
minute
shake
of
his
head
because
he
had
neither
the
time
nor
the
inclination
to
attempt
anything
as
crude
as
striking
up
an
acquaintance
by
barring
her
path
paul
angled
his
course
aside
she
angled
too
hello
she
said
brightly
i
thought
you
be
along
sooner
paul
grayson
gulped
obviously
she
mistook
him
for
someone
else
and
a
faint
feeling
of
jealousy
ran
through
him
for
the
lucky
man
who
owned
her
affections
the
street
lamp
behind
him
must
have
cast
heavy
shadows
across
his
face
making
identification
difficult
he
opened
his
mouth
to
explain
away
the
mistake
but
the
girl
came
up
to
him
hardly
slackening
her
pace
until
the
last
possible
moment
then
instead
of
speaking
paul
found
his
parted
mouth
met
by
hers
her
lips
were
warm
her
arms
came
around
him
in
a
quick
embrace
and
his
arms
instinctively
closed
about
her
waist
paul
kissed
back
cheerfully
accepting
the
pleasure
of
the
error
with
a
sort
of
devilish
glee
then
he
stepped
back
i
sorry
he
said
that
i
am
not
the
guy
you
thought
i
was
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
blink
her
expression
changed
to
surprise
and
then
her
mouth
opened
in
a
scream
as
her
eyes
flicked
away
from
him
and
centered
over
his
left
shoulder
paul
started
to
whirl
but
someone
dropped
the
north
pole
on
the
back
of
his
skull
it
chilled
him
completely
her
scream
rang
in
his
ears
as
he
fell
forward
vaguely
he
felt
the
silk
of
her
dress
against
his
outstretched
hands
and
then
against
his
cheek
just
before
the
sidewalk
rose
up
to
grind
against
his
face
something
pulled
at
his
coat
then
he
felt
nothing
more
only
the
frightened
scream
of
the
woman
that
rang
in
his
ears
shrill
angry
fearful
and
never
ending
until
paul
realized
that
the
siren
wail
was
not
her
scream
but
the
ringing
of
his
own
ears
and
that
the
girl
was
sitting
on
the
sidewalk
with
his
head
between
her
thighs
she
was
rubbing
the
nape
of
his
neck
with
her
fingertips
quietly
erasing
the
pain
bit
by
bit
the
threshold
of
ringing
in
his
ears
diminished
and
his
field
of
vision
increased
as
the
darting
lights
went
away
and
paul
grayson
then
could
hear
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
the
babble
of
voices
what
happened
this
man
was
clipped
by
a
thug
you
saw
it
came
the
voices
in
a
mad
garble
of
scrambled
speeches
right
in
front
of
my
eyes
the
babble
broke
into
many
and
varied
subjects
curiosity
both
morbid
and
samaritan
anger
both
righteous
and
superficial
but
both
directed
at
the
things
that
make
such
happenings
possible
suggestions
both
sensible
and
absurd
and
offers
both
welcome
and
ridiculous
paul
groaned
and
tried
to
lift
his
hand
to
the
raw
spot
on
his
chin
where
the
sidewalk
had
removed
some
hide
the
woman
looked
down
at
him
and
smiled
in
a
wan
apprehensive
manner
you
all
right
paul
struggled
to
sit
up
and
made
it
with
her
help
the
wave
of
pain
rose
and
localized
in
his
head
at
about
forty
degrees
right
latitude
it
made
him
want
to
carry
his
head
at
an
angle
with
his
neck
ducked
down
below
the
level
of
the
knot
of
pain
hands
helped
him
to
his
feet
led
him
across
the
sidewalk
while
he
became
stronger
by
the
moment
he
shook
his
head
to
clear
it
and
winced
as
the
motion
caused
the
knot
of
pain
to
vibrate
nastily
what
happened
he
asked
in
a
quavering
voice
it
sounded
like
someone
else
voice
to
him
and
surprised
at
the
sound
of
it
he
repeated
the
question
it
still
sounded
like
someone
else
voice
and
while
he
was
wondering
if
his
voice
would
sound
like
that
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
girl
explained
what
had
happened
paul
missed
most
of
it
but
then
asked
another
question
did
you
see
him
no
she
said
her
voice
was
regretful
yet
tinted
with
a
dash
of
amusement
he
sort
of
rose
out
of
the
shadow
behind
you
you
a
tall
man
you
know
all
i
saw
was
a
ragged
silhouette
he
hit
you
you
fell
i
screamed
he
grabbed
at
your
wallet
her
voice
trailed
away
unhappily
paul
smiled
nothing
in
it
but
personal
papers
all
replaceable
not
more
than
a
few
dollars
i
have
handed
it
over
rather
than
get
this
clip
on
the
skull
too
bad
you
could
see
him
the
touch
of
amusement
came
again
i
had
my
eyes
closed
sort
of
paul
smiled
again
inwardly
he
was
welcoming
the
footpad
to
the
contents
of
his
wallet
and
accepting
the
bop
on
the
bean
as
the
price
to
pay
for
an
introduction
to
the
girl
someone
in
the
crowd
said
you
better
come
inside
until
you
feel
all
right
paul
shook
his
head
and
was
happy
to
find
that
the
knot
inside
had
diminished
to
a
faint
pinpoint
his
voice
was
sounding
more
like
his
own
too
i
got
to
go
he
said
but
the
wail
of
sirens
came
and
a
police
car
dashed
to
the
curb
it
spilled
policemen
from
all
doors
who
came
warily
what
going
on
here
demanded
the
sergeant
paul
explained
you
better
come
to
the
station
and
lodge
a
complaint
paul
shook
his
head
i
paul
grayson
of
the
bureau
of
astrogation
he
said
i
could
prove
it
but
the
crook
has
my
identification
papers
i
due
to
take
off
for
space
within
paul
looked
at
his
watch
within
forty
minutes
he
finished
we
require
a
complaint
ca
you
take
it
pleaded
paul
good
lord
man
i
ca
identify
a
criminal
that
clipped
me
from
behind
hell
the
only
contact
i
had
with
him
was
hitting
the
back
of
my
head
against
his
blackjack
the
sergeant
looked
at
the
woman
you
ca
help
not
much
more
he
was
just
a
blurred
shadow
to
me
he
looked
like
any
other
man
wearing
dark
clothing
which
can
be
changed
all
too
easily
the
sergeant
went
to
the
police
car
and
spoke
to
the
main
office
over
the
radio
he
returned
in
a
moment
the
lieutenant
says
we
to
run
you
over
to
the
spaceport
and
take
depositions
en
route
that
save
time
for
you
and
it
will
get
the
dope
for
our
records
that
we
must
have
you
too
miss
i
nora
phillips
i
go
along
of
course
will
you
have
one
of
your
men
keep
an
eye
out
for
a
tall
man
who
should
have
been
passing
here
by
now
he
overdue
he
will
be
tommy
morgan
we
had
a
date
but
i
came
out
to
meet
him
on
his
way
to
my
home
tell
him
what
happened
and
explain
that
i
return
home
as
soon
as
this
matter
is
taken
care
of
the
sergeant
smiled
toby
you
take
this
stand
and
ask
everybody
that
comes
along
if
he
morgan
then
explain
right
the
ride
so
far
as
official
information
went
was
strictly
a
waste
of
time
paul
made
a
mental
note
of
nora
phillips
address
and
telephone
number
and
decided
that
the
incident
called
for
good
reason
to
renew
the
acquaintance
the
sergeant
made
it
easy
by
telling
them
when
you
return
from
your
trip
grayson
i
ask
you
to
come
in
to
the
station
and
make
a
formal
complaint
you
be
there
too
miss
phillips
i
be
glad
to
help
she
told
them
then
she
turned
to
paul
with
astrogation
he
nodded
but
why
proxima
i
heard
it
was
a
completely
useless
place
paul
shook
his
head
we
want
to
measure
the
distance
to
better
accuracy
than
heliocentric
parallax
will
permit
us
he
said
we
know
the
speed
of
light
to
a
fine
decimal
and
we
can
measure
time
to
even
a
finer
degree
so
we
started
a
radio
beam
towards
centauri
four
years
ago
and
it
will
be
arriving
in
a
time
then
we
have
the
distance
to
a
nice
detail
of
perfection
nora
thought
for
a
moment
i
suppose
you
ultimately
aiming
at
neosol
she
suggested
that
the
idea
but
neosol
is
a
hundred
light
years
away
one
hundred
and
at
the
last
count
paul
corrected
so
it
will
take
a
hundred
and
forty
no
he
smiled
less
than
three
years
from
now
you
see
seven
light
years
is
the
greatest
distance
that
separates
the
stars
between
here
and
neosol
we
got
a
nice
network
of
radio
beams
the
pathway
between
here
and
neosol
oh
he
admitted
with
a
smile
the
triangulation
beams
will
be
arriving
from
now
until
a
hundred
years
from
now
but
they
mostly
and
the
final
beam
from
earth
to
neoterra
will
take
the
full
time
but
in
the
meantime
we
can
refine
our
space
charts
using
the
network
of
beams
once
they
start
to
arrive
and
each
time
one
of
the
triangulation
gets
home
we
be
able
to
refine
the
charts
even
more
but
there
no
sense
in
waiting
for
a
century
and
a
half
the
sergeant
looked
at
paul
you
certain
you
can
fly
with
that
bump
on
the
head
sure
why
not
let
someone
else
take
it
paul
shook
his
head
it
my
job
he
said
quickly
but
there
must
be
someone
else
that
can
do
it
what
if
you
died
oh
there
are
others
trained
in
this
sort
of
job
in
that
case
why
not
let
one
of
them
take
it
then
paul
shook
his
head
again
i
all
right
he
said
he
realized
that
his
insistence
was
too
vigorous
and
that
his
reasons
were
too
lame
but
he
could
not
let
them
know
why
it
was
so
important
that
paul
grayson
go
in
person
if
haedaecker
got
wind
of
what
paul
carried
in
his
spacecraft
there
would
be
hell
to
pay
he
thought
of
a
plausible
excuse
most
of
them
are
on
earth
right
now
could
you
call
one
of
them
paul
smiled
ruefully
they
outside
of
the
solar
system
the
sergeant
nodded
the
ca
cross
interstellar
space
he
said
it
was
a
statement
thrown
in
to
display
his
knowledge
to
the
technician
from
the
bureau
of
astrogation
and
also
a
leader
for
more
conversation
paul
did
not
bite
that
haedaecker
theory
added
the
sergeant
is
it
he
added
after
another
moment
of
silence
haedaecker
theory
is
that
the
propagates
only
in
a
region
under
the
influence
of
solar
activity
explained
paul
he
looked
out
of
the
police
car
and
saw
the
spaceport
only
a
few
moments
away
then
he
talked
volubly
to
fill
in
the
time
so
that
he
could
be
off
without
further
questioning
haedaecker
had
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
his
theory
but
they
all
were
missing
one
point
that
was
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
haedaecker
face
we
can
talk
with
ease
from
the
zero
laboratory
on
pluto
to
the
solar
lab
on
mercury
to
the
boys
who
are
working
in
the
poisonous
atmosphere
of
jupiter
to
the
paleontologists
who
are
combing
venus
said
paul
and
the
radiation
laboratory
sent
a
gang
to
try
the
five
planets
of
sirius
again
they
got
the
working
after
a
bit
of
fiddling
with
the
tuning
but
we
not
been
able
to
get
so
much
as
a
whisper
from
sol
to
proxima
centauri
via
what
started
haedaecker
thinking
was
the
experiment
they
tried
about
ten
years
ago
paul
went
on
before
anybody
could
interrupt
no
one
can
measure
the
velocity
of
the
you
know
so
they
started
a
spacecraft
running
right
away
from
sol
so
long
as
they
were
within
a
fair
radius
the
went
both
ways
easily
but
once
they
went
into
superdrive
and
raced
away
from
sol
and
got
out
beyond
the
orbit
of
pluto
by
quite
a
bit
they
lost
contact
completely
they
made
some
measurements
but
these
were
quite
unsuccessful
all
we
know
is
that
we
can
use
the
for
speech
for
a
long
distance
beyond
the
orbit
of
pluto
but
beyond
some
distance
that
might
lie
between
ten
times
that
orbit
and
i
think
they
tried
it
at
a
light
month
the
dies
out
abruptly
it
falls
off
like
a
cliff
you
know
no
apparent
attenuation
of
the
so
long
as
it
is
strong
enough
to
get
there
beyond
that
there
is
not
even
the
whisper
of
a
signal
a
peculiar
thing
but
we
know
very
little
about
the
and
the
driver
brought
the
police
car
to
a
screeching
halt
here
you
are
folks
he
chirped
paul
got
out
of
the
car
quickly
i
be
back
he
told
the
sergeant
i
call
you
and
then
to
nora
phillips
he
added
i
call
you
too
do
she
said
pointedly
i
like
to
know
more
about
the
paul
nodded
amiably
he
did
not
voice
his
inner
thought
would
i
baby
chapter
the
police
car
in
the
broad
roadway
and
headed
off
to
return
nora
phillips
to
her
home
and
to
pick
up
the
officer
set
to
sentry
duty
paul
waved
them
off
and
then
started
to
walk
up
the
pavement
towards
the
administration
building
he
was
feeling
better
everything
pleased
him
vastly
the
knot
inside
of
his
head
was
gone
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
very
delectable
armful
of
femininity
and
now
he
had
been
chauffeured
to
the
spaceport
by
none
other
than
the
city
police
department
complete
with
siren
on
his
way
up
the
sidewalk
paul
planned
the
retort
perfect
anticipating
some
humorous
sarcasm
on
the
mode
of
his
arrival
paul
hoped
to
crush
any
verbal
volley
with
unanswerable
repartee
usually
paul
fount
of
boundless
wit
ran
just
a
trifle
slow
following
the
definition
of
a
bon
mot
something
you
think
of
on
the
way
home
this
time
he
was
going
to
be
prepared
he
swung
the
door
airily
and
strode
in
his
tongue
poised
over
a
few
words
of
terse
wit
the
guard
looked
at
him
and
swallowed
a
large
lump
how
in
hell
did
you
get
out
he
gasped
this
was
not
according
to
plan
unfortunately
the
guard
had
not
read
paul
script
and
the
prepared
answer
would
not
fit
the
question
i
was
never
in
said
paul
lamely
again
wishing
he
had
a
tongue
full
of
ready
wit
instead
of
fumbling
for
a
prepared
speech
the
hell
you
were
paul
took
it
from
there
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
guard
had
not
followed
paul
mental
conversation
that
was
a
car
reserved
for
very
important
personages
he
said
from
now
on
you
can
call
me
viper
the
guard
this
but
how
did
you
get
out
he
asked
his
voice
was
almost
a
plea
you
did
pass
me
were
you
guarding
the
jail
too
chuckled
paul
fast
man
no
you
came
in
a
taxicab
the
first
time
ah
yes
but
that
was
years
ago
before
people
knew
of
my
brilliance
importance
and
high
station
now
years
ago
my
eye
less
than
fifteen
minutes
ago
i
did
not
you
did
not
me
paul
feeling
of
airy
came
down
a
few
thousand
feet
and
mired
in
a
cumulus
cloud
look
grayson
you
came
in
a
taxicab
and
breezed
in
here
about
fifteen
minutes
ago
as
though
you
had
only
a
minute
to
spare
you
thinking
of
someone
else
your
picture
said
paul
grayson
and
so
did
your
identification
how
else
would
i
be
knowing
you
you
seen
me
often
enough
maybe
but
do
forget
that
i
see
a
few
thousand
people
every
day
and
i
know
you
only
well
enough
to
know
that
you
do
own
bona
fide
credentials
you
got
i
paul
blinked
a
great
searing
light
was
starting
to
cut
through
the
cobwebs
of
his
brain
the
airy
feeling
of
dropped
below
the
cumulus
cloud
and
made
a
landing
on
strictly
solid
ground
look
he
said
soberly
you
claim
a
man
came
through
here
a
few
minutes
ago
resembling
me
unless
you
ai
who
you
are
he
was
you
he
was
me
my
papers
were
stolen
less
than
an
hour
ago
he
must
have
the
guard
was
no
imbecile
he
turned
in
a
flash
and
hit
a
button
on
the
desk
beside
him
an
alarm
bell
rang
in
some
inner
room
and
four
more
guards
came
tumbling
out
of
a
doorway
alert
and
ready
for
trouble
tommy
snapped
the
guard
at
the
door
go
check
paul
grayson
ship
that
number
burast
the
guard
looked
at
paul
carefully
you
a
dead
ringer
for
the
other
guy
that
came
through
here
he
said
but
you
happen
to
know
paul
grayson
burast
number
anybody
could
memorize
it
paul
watched
the
other
guards
tumble
out
of
the
building
and
head
off
across
the
spaceport
on
a
dead
run
drawing
pistols
as
they
went
he
started
to
follow
them
the
guard
barred
his
way
no
you
do
but
that
guy
is
stealing
maybe
your
name
is
grayson
and
maybe
the
other
guy
is
grayson
you
look
alike
and
he
had
identification
i
do
know
paul
grayson
well
enough
to
accept
or
deny
you
or
him
but
until
you
show
me
credentials
entitling
you
to
roam
this
spaceport
you
stay
outside
but
the
boys
i
sent
out
there
are
capable
do
get
in
their
way
they
might
shoot
the
wrong
paul
grayson
but
get
your
credentials
get
some
sort
of
identification
paul
looked
at
the
big
standard
clock
on
the
wall
but
i
got
less
than
eight
minutes
until
time
there
always
tomorrow
you
get
cleared
first
or
no
entry
and
that
final
hell
eternal
bells
exploded
paul
the
cops
that
brought
me
here
did
so
because
i
was
clipped
on
the
bean
and
robbed
it
my
job
explained
the
guard
quietly
i
do
want
to
be
any
more
of
a
bastard
than
i
have
to
be
if
you
paul
grayson
and
the
cops
know
you
were
robbed
there
the
telephone
paul
grabbed
the
phone
and
started
to
dial
fuming
at
the
delay
first
there
was
a
few
seconds
until
the
dial
tone
came
then
paul
dialed
the
outside
line
another
few
seconds
of
delay
until
he
could
dial
the
number
of
the
municipal
police
department
then
a
bored
voice
asked
police
headquarters
who
calling
please
this
is
paul
grayson
at
the
municipal
spaceport
what
the
trouble
out
there
a
crook
stole
my
identification
we
send
a
man
out
to
investigate
no
yelled
paul
to
prevent
the
telephone
operator
from
cutting
off
the
line
on
the
assumption
that
the
call
was
closed
you
understand
i
supposed
to
take
off
in
ah
seven
minutes
we
ca
get
a
man
there
that
quickly
you
have
to
wait
look
said
paul
hurriedly
there
a
squad
car
that
just
dropped
me
here
i
was
clipped
on
talman
avenue
and
they
went
there
to
investigate
they
brought
me
here
why
not
call
them
and
ask
them
to
come
back
and
explain
to
the
guards
here
what
happened
i
check
that
and
take
action
promised
the
voice
in
a
completely
bored
tone
paul
fumed
there
was
the
sound
of
a
shot
outside
followed
instantly
by
the
shrill
whining
song
of
a
ricochet
probably
a
glance
from
the
hard
metal
flank
of
a
parked
spacecraft
the
telephone
went
dead
and
a
second
later
came
the
dial
tone
again
paul
hung
it
up
reluctantly
and
that
made
it
worse
other
hands
were
not
as
imbued
with
the
importance
of
the
project
to
other
hands
it
was
a
routine
bit
of
trouble
not
the
matter
of
life
and
death
that
it
was
to
paul
grayson
yet
he
to
whom
this
thing
was
vastly
important
must
sit
with
folded
hands
while
men
handled
the
matter
in
ponderous
routine
the
clock
continued
to
turn
inexorably
paul
mind
went
to
work
it
was
less
than
two
minutes
since
the
police
car
left
give
them
a
minute
to
check
up
and
a
minute
to
make
sure
then
a
minute
to
call
the
car
that
was
three
of
the
precious
seven
minutes
gone
to
hell
if
it
took
them
as
long
to
return
as
it
took
them
to
get
where
they
now
were
throw
another
two
minutes
down
the
drain
and
that
left
two
minutes
in
which
to
let
the
sergeant
explain
to
the
guard
clear
paul
grayson
on
a
pro
tem
basis
get
him
across
the
spaceport
to
his
ship
in
up
and
away
he
groaned
he
wished
frantically
for
some
means
of
knowing
what
was
going
on
what
measures
were
being
made
in
his
behalf
he
wanted
desperately
to
listen
to
the
radio
in
the
police
car
he
wanted
to
get
on
the
radio
himself
and
roar
out
explanations
to
exhort
them
to
greater
effort
the
siren
wail
of
the
police
car
cut
into
his
thoughts
and
paul
raced
to
the
door
to
fling
it
open
the
car
slid
to
the
curb
and
the
siren
whined
down
the
scale
as
the
driver
turned
it
off
they
got
out
of
the
car
and
came
up
the
walk
briskly
hurry
he
called
he
cast
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
standard
clock
he
had
three
minutes
tell
who
i
am
he
exploded
breathlessly
the
sergeant
blinked
but
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
i
told
you
hell
grunted
the
guard
you
told
me
too
to
the
sergeant
the
guard
said
do
you
know
anything
about
all
this
we
got
a
call
that
this
man
had
been
clipped
and
robbed
he
was
the
sergeant
looked
at
nora
phillips
can
you
identify
this
man
nora
bit
her
lip
he
paul
grayson
the
guard
speared
nora
with
a
cold
look
do
you
know
that
or
is
it
just
what
he
said
why
i
she
never
met
him
otherwise
put
in
the
sergeant
that
true
but
i
think
thinking
ai
good
enough
nora
looked
at
paul
have
you
anything
to
show
paul
shook
his
head
nothing
that
would
cut
any
ice
belt
buckle
with
initial
a
few
laundry
marks
and
cleaners
marks
a
checkbook
in
my
hip
pocket
but
no
name
printed
in
it
i
might
check
the
balance
against
the
bank
but
that
would
be
tomorrow
morning
we
might
call
doctor
haedaecker
but
by
the
time
we
arrived
on
some
means
of
personal
identification
time
would
be
gone
and
past
paul
paused
breathless
his
whole
body
poised
tense
and
his
head
bent
to
listen
there
came
the
patter
of
feet
outside
the
standard
clock
was
swinging
towards
the
hour
two
minutes
remained
enough
if
all
went
quick
and
well
one
of
the
guards
burst
in
he
took
a
quick
look
around
and
spotted
the
police
sergeant
good
he
said
breathing
heavily
we
just
shot
a
man
out
there
you
needed
was
it
the
man
who
passed
himself
off
as
me
shouted
paul
grayson
as
we
came
up
to
burast
this
guy
jumped
from
the
airlock
and
started
to
run
we
gave
chase
and
lost
him
in
the
dark
beyond
a
group
of
parked
spacecraft
we
called
for
him
to
halt
we
found
him
again
on
the
far
side
of
the
ships
and
joe
fired
a
shot
it
must
of
missed
him
because
he
kept
running
and
then
we
all
started
shooting
losing
him
behind
another
ship
parked
by
the
fence
you
know
old
mupol
the
way
the
guts
are
parked
all
over
the
spaceport
and
left
to
rust
a
derelict
if
i
ever
saw
one
and
after
this
i
say
it
was
about
time
we
cleaned
up
that
old
wreck
please
hurry
blurted
we
got
to
the
fence
where
he
climbed
out
over
some
junk
stacked
behind
mupol
we
went
after
him
and
then
guess
what
what
we
found
this
character
flat
on
his
face
in
the
road
as
dead
a
corpse
as
ever
died
paul
exploded
again
that
proves
it
he
said
now
the
spaceport
guard
shook
his
head
this
shake
was
echoed
by
the
sergeant
of
police
but
i
work
to
do
the
sergeant
smiled
unhappily
we
work
to
do
too
son
i
call
you
grayson
for
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
there
is
not
much
doubt
that
something
is
highly
rotten
here
but
we
got
to
be
certain
been
one
slugging
and
robbery
the
attempted
theft
of
spacecraft
and
now
a
man
killed
by
armed
guards
in
performance
of
their
duty
this
is
going
to
require
clearing
up
before
we
let
you
go
but
you
know
where
to
find
me
i
due
on
proxima
centauri
i
to
check
the
arrival
of
the
bureau
of
astrogation
survey
beam
i
to
take
off
you
are
paul
grayson
if
the
other
guy
was
paul
grayson
would
he
have
run
from
cops
the
sergeant
laughed
bitterly
this
may
come
as
a
shock
to
you
son
but
you
have
no
idea
of
how
many
of
our
nicest
people
pillars
of
society
and
solid
citizens
have
secrets
in
their
daily
lives
that
make
them
shun
law
and
order
when
law
and
order
comes
toward
them
with
a
drawn
pistol
a
subpoena
or
a
warrant
for
arrest
the
loudspeaker
came
to
life
at
that
moment
burast
taking
off
for
proxima
centauri
i
timing
signal
for
synchronization
first
check
the
voice
died
to
be
replaced
by
a
series
of
clicks
one
second
apart
that
my
notice
the
guard
snapped
a
switch
master
control
he
said
quietly
this
is
edwards
guard
at
the
main
gate
hold
the
flight
hold
the
flight
answered
the
speaker
hold
the
flight
we
had
trouble
here
is
that
what
the
shooting
was
all
about
the
timing
clicks
died
in
the
background
what
the
trouble
we
got
two
paul
graysons
wanting
to
take
off
tell
to
draw
straws
this
is
costing
money
one
of
them
goddammmit
yelled
paul
i
paul
grayson
and
i
that
you
have
to
prove
son
said
the
is
dead
finished
the
guard
dead
gasped
the
speaker
which
one
it
ai
funny
said
the
guard
seriously
just
hold
the
flight
okay
sport
but
paul
spoke
up
can
you
get
the
elecalc
free
for
a
course
for
tomorrow
night
who
that
speaking
i
paul
grayson
the
live
one
huh
chuckled
the
unimpressed
voice
from
the
speaker
his
bantering
tone
made
paul
want
to
rip
out
his
larynx
with
a
crooked
thumb
and
shove
it
down
his
throat
okay
we
have
the
electronic
calculator
figure
out
a
course
for
proxima
i
for
tomorrow
night
doubtless
will
take
the
flight
oh
damn
groaned
paul
why
does
this
have
to
happen
to
me
the
sergeant
smiled
if
this
were
the
first
attempt
to
steal
a
spacecraft
i
be
surprised
the
guard
shook
his
head
it
more
than
that
he
added
sagely
if
the
other
guy
was
a
thief
bent
on
swiping
a
burast
ship
he
could
have
gone
off
in
it
ten
minutes
before
the
second
paul
grayson
arrived
he
did
he
was
waiting
for
the
signal
and
if
he
were
a
crook
he
hoped
to
fill
in
the
real
paul
grayson
place
if
he
was
the
real
grayson
we
killed
a
frightened
bureau
man
and
this
bird
here
paul
looked
at
the
standard
clock
it
was
now
moving
past
the
precise
second
marked
for
he
sighed
resignedly
and
relaxed
for
the
moment
we
assume
that
i
am
paul
grayson
he
said
quietly
so
soon
as
we
can
find
someone
to
corroborate
me
the
second
part
of
your
supposition
will
have
no
grounds
the
sergeant
shook
his
head
i
think
we
all
best
head
for
the
station
and
wait
this
thing
out
paul
gulped
you
going
to
jug
me
both
of
you
but
you
ca
arrest
me
five
will
get
you
eight
chuckled
the
sergeant
nora
phillips
came
forward
until
she
stood
between
paul
and
the
sergeant
why
am
i
being
arrested
she
demanded
the
sergeant
smiled
affably
no
one
is
being
arrested
why
am
i
being
detained
held
or
otherwise
prevented
from
enjoying
my
rights
of
freedom
she
snapped
paul
shrugged
i
missed
my
he
said
i
have
to
wait
until
tomorrow
anyway
and
i
can
get
identification
in
an
hour
or
so
without
any
trouble
in
fact
i
gladly
go
along
with
you
if
permit
me
the
telephone
they
can
bring
my
stuff
down
there
and
we
can
settle
this
quickly
but
there
is
no
reason
to
hold
miss
phillips
the
sergeant
turned
to
the
woman
and
bowed
deferentially
forgive
a
harried
policeman
his
habits
he
said
quietly
as
a
shoe
salesman
will
mentally
catalog
the
shoes
of
the
people
sitting
opposite
to
him
on
the
street
car
and
a
physician
will
mentally
diagnose
the
ills
of
his
at
a
baseball
game
a
policeman
habitually
views
the
acts
of
his
contemporaries
with
one
eye
toward
their
motives
meaning
what
demanded
paul
grayson
the
policeman
faced
paul
and
said
with
a
level
voice
so
far
as
every
bit
of
evidence
goes
you
are
paul
grayson
you
behave
as
a
man
might
behave
when
placed
in
the
position
you
appear
to
be
in
on
the
other
hand
if
you
were
a
smart
man
you
would
behave
as
you
are
now
behaving
even
though
you
had
reasons
most
dire
to
execute
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
watchful
eye
of
law
and
order
this
is
a
bit
too
trite
a
stolen
wallet
containing
only
a
few
bucks
and
a
whale
of
a
lot
of
identification
complete
with
a
witness
to
the
crime
makes
fine
story
material
to
use
in
establishing
a
false
identity
motive
can
come
later
if
any
if
you
are
paul
grayson
i
will
make
abject
apology
if
your
tale
is
not
true
there
will
be
some
tall
explaining
to
make
how
about
miss
phillips
boy
friend
now
that
a
nice
thought
but
not
necessarily
conclusive
proof
he
might
easily
and
sensibly
be
included
to
give
any
story
an
air
of
veracity
however
we
can
check
with
toby
reed
as
soon
as
we
get
back
to
the
patrol
car
chapter
paul
grayson
awoke
the
following
morning
to
the
tune
of
the
telephone
beside
his
bed
this
is
sergeant
hollowell
said
the
other
man
i
just
called
to
apologize
once
more
and
to
tell
you
that
everything
is
we
even
give
you
a
guard
if
you
want
it
paul
stretched
and
said
sleepily
thanks
sergeant
i
guess
everything
will
come
out
all
right
without
a
guard
okay
i
glad
for
all
concerned
for
your
information
and
not
to
be
repeated
the
character
we
got
last
night
is
was
a
petty
crook
with
a
record
as
long
as
your
arm
a
plain
case
of
theft
interrupted
luckily
we
call
it
closed
thanks
again
and
the
ship
it
there
as
it
was
last
night
so
far
as
we
and
the
burast
guards
know
no
one
but
the
crook
was
near
it
and
no
one
will
be
permitted
to
go
near
it
until
you
come
to
take
it
up
paul
breathed
easier
okay
see
you
later
your
wallet
intact
will
be
delivered
to
your
apartment
within
the
hour
that
closes
that
case
too
the
policeman
voice
sounded
well
pleased
with
himself
and
the
night
work
paul
hung
up
and
sprawled
back
in
bed
thinking
there
was
no
point
in
arousing
the
policeman
suspicions
again
a
howl
of
might
delay
paul
grayson
might
cause
another
technician
to
be
sent
to
proxima
i
to
check
the
arrival
of
the
radio
beam
paul
had
all
the
reason
in
the
galaxy
for
wanting
to
be
there
himself
and
an
equally
large
quantity
of
reasons
for
not
wanting
someone
else
running
his
ship
but
there
more
to
this
than
met
the
eye
paul
reached
for
a
cigarette
and
laid
back
in
bed
blowing
smoke
at
the
ceiling
a
smile
touched
his
lips
aside
from
the
annoyance
at
being
delayed
for
twenty
four
hours
it
had
been
one
large
evening
then
his
grin
died
and
he
reached
out
one
quick
arm
and
picked
up
the
telephone
again
he
dialed
a
number
and
waited
until
the
ringing
was
answered
stacey
this
is
stacey
office
is
he
there
who
calling
please
tell
him
paul
grayson
if
he
up
yet
he
up
came
the
cheerfully
amused
voice
at
the
other
end
but
still
grumpy
i
cheer
him
up
promised
paul
there
was
the
click
of
a
connection
made
and
one
quick
burr
from
the
ringing
of
the
distant
telephone
stacey
came
the
reply
paul
grayson
hell
eternal
i
thought
you
were
on
your
way
to
proxima
got
delayed
a
day
stacey
was
silent
for
a
moment
paul
imagined
that
he
could
hear
the
clicking
of
the
other
man
mind
as
it
started
to
analyze
the
situation
then
stacey
said
what
on
the
technical
mind
paul
you
did
call
me
at
this
outrageous
hour
just
to
pass
the
time
of
day
john
how
much
will
it
cost
me
to
have
a
matter
looked
into
normal
charge
is
a
day
and
expenses
i
think
i
owe
you
a
few
favors
make
it
expenses
if
it
is
too
involved
it
might
be
then
we
make
some
arrangement
as
soon
as
we
know
how
involved
it
is
but
migawd
paul
what
brings
you
to
the
employment
of
a
detective
someone
tried
to
steal
my
spacecraft
last
night
nuts
call
the
coppers
nope
there
more
to
this
than
meets
the
eye
what
for
instance
i
be
over
to
tell
you
about
it
big
i
do
know
bothersome
anyway
i
wait
make
it
quick
paul
hung
up
and
then
went
into
a
whirlwind
of
action
he
dressed
and
shaved
and
gulped
a
glass
of
orange
juice
he
eschewed
breakfast
promising
his
stomach
that
food
would
come
in
due
time
he
took
his
car
from
the
garage
where
he
had
parked
it
for
a
month
the
evening
before
and
within
a
few
minutes
after
hanging
up
the
telephone
paul
grayson
was
heading
towards
stacey
office
it
was
a
small
office
stacey
secretary
knew
paul
by
sight
if
not
by
telephone
voice
and
she
nodded
him
in
to
the
inner
office
inner
office
was
as
small
as
the
outer
office
because
file
cabinets
lined
the
room
the
detective
sat
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
poring
over
some
pages
of
writing
he
looked
up
at
once
and
greeted
paul
with
a
smile
so
someone
tried
to
swipe
your
ship
he
blurted
and
why
is
that
a
case
for
the
cops
john
how
would
you
go
about
stealing
a
ship
get
into
the
spaceport
on
some
pretext
get
into
the
ship
by
some
means
and
then
take
off
like
i
had
to
make
messier
by
or
whatever
place
happened
to
be
aligned
at
the
time
that
what
i
been
thinking
so
you
would
worry
about
the
dispersion
factor
you
would
worry
about
course
your
main
interest
would
lie
in
getting
the
hell
out
of
there
before
someone
came
along
and
decided
that
you
were
intent
upon
theft
naturally
paul
nodded
then
he
explained
as
well
as
he
knew
and
as
well
as
he
could
remember
everything
that
had
taken
place
on
the
previous
evening
he
finished
up
with
so
i
met
a
gorgeous
gal
kissed
her
by
accident
and
found
it
fun
was
clipped
by
a
footpad
and
sort
of
nursed
back
to
the
conscious
level
by
the
same
luscious
dame
had
two
rides
in
a
police
patrol
car
one
trip
to
the
hoosegow
cleared
of
all
suspicion
by
an
official
courier
arriving
with
officially
sealed
pouch
of
identification
was
escorted
home
in
style
go
on
there
more
to
this
than
that
remember
what
sergeant
hollowell
said
that
a
stolen
wallet
and
a
witness
were
fine
dovetails
towards
the
establishment
of
a
false
identity
yeah
what
better
way
to
louse
paul
grayson
up
than
to
decoy
him
with
a
flagrantly
beautiful
woman
a
dame
possessed
of
and
poise
yet
incredibly
feminine
enough
to
betray
a
warm
human
passionate
hunger
for
some
one
man
natural
male
concupiscence
would
draw
any
man
into
the
game
of
trying
to
divert
her
affection
towards
himself
speak
for
yourself
wolf
paul
grinned
at
stacey
he
stood
up
maybe
i
better
look
into
this
thing
myself
set
stacey
on
the
trail
of
a
female
and
siddown
i
a
married
man
i
was
thinking
of
your
poor
deluded
wife
and
daughter
gloria
knows
all
about
your
natural
male
concupiscence
and
will
know
you
as
a
doddering
old
man
by
the
time
she
discovers
that
you
can
tell
a
man
from
a
woman
without
looking
at
their
clothing
paul
sat
down
again
he
had
not
intended
to
leave
anyway
so
he
said
what
better
way
to
divert
paul
grayson
than
to
bait
him
with
a
gorgeous
dame
stacey
grunted
to
divert
you
long
enough
to
clip
you
to
steal
your
papers
to
enter
your
ship
for
what
purpose
that
where
the
mystery
comes
in
the
guy
had
plenty
of
time
to
fire
up
the
drivers
and
grab
an
armful
of
sky
the
galaxy
makes
a
fine
hiding
place
john
they
scoured
the
stellar
systems
of
a
hundred
and
more
suns
before
they
found
that
neosol
had
a
planet
that
was
capable
of
harboring
terran
life
without
difficulty
god
knows
no
man
hunting
for
a
place
to
live
would
wait
and
head
for
proxima
i
yet
that
seems
to
be
what
the
crook
had
tried
to
do
stacey
shook
his
head
you
are
supposing
that
nora
phillips
was
mingled
in
some
sort
of
plot
to
steal
a
spacecraft
granting
that
paul
explain
me
one
thing
just
why
would
a
person
intent
upon
delaying
you
go
so
far
towards
helping
you
huh
she
did
sort
of
rub
your
skull
did
she
and
a
fine
job
she
did
of
it
too
professional
seemed
as
if
if
not
professional
at
least
experienced
so
she
brought
you
out
of
the
unconscious
painful
dark
in
time
to
intercept
the
criminal
at
his
business
uh
and
nora
phillips
strode
up
and
kissed
you
with
warm
mad
passion
on
the
street
thus
immobilizing
your
skull
long
enough
for
the
enterprising
sharpshooter
to
take
a
stance
and
perfect
his
backswing
so
you
do
think
so
stacey
thought
for
a
moment
this
does
not
smack
of
simple
theft
he
said
at
length
hell
growled
grayson
that
what
i
been
trying
to
tell
you
um
i
see
so
someone
looks
like
me
he
tried
to
swipe
my
ship
it
would
appear
but
they
did
need
a
dame
to
distract
me
i
could
have
been
pushed
off
by
a
gunman
frankly
i
am
of
the
type
that
will
gladly
hand
over
my
wallet
my
shoes
my
worldly
goods
rather
than
to
have
a
hole
drilled
through
my
dinner
so
john
here
is
nora
phillips
address
you
can
get
the
name
of
the
defunct
crook
from
the
police
i
sure
see
what
connection
they
might
have
had
stacey
looked
at
paul
with
a
smile
you
not
making
uranium
out
of
broken
pop
bottles
are
you
nope
i
just
a
guy
working
for
the
bureau
of
astrogation
but
with
a
secret
under
his
hat
large
enough
to
keep
him
from
yelping
too
loud
you
know
the
reason
for
that
and
how
many
others
damned
few
less
than
six
i
guess
stacey
shook
his
head
again
they
do
clip
screwballs
for
having
a
idea
crammed
in
their
simple
skulls
so
far
as
i
can
see
it
you
got
nothing
to
conceal
nothing
to
steal
and
nothing
much
worth
hiding
if
haedaecker
knew
what
i
had
stacey
grunted
if
haedaecker
wanted
to
stop
you
he
would
not
have
to
hire
a
bunch
of
phony
actors
to
do
it
he
said
succinctly
but
what
else
my
life
of
crime
chuckled
stacey
tells
me
that
there
are
as
many
motives
for
crime
as
there
are
men
with
ambition
avarice
and
ability
the
trouble
is
that
there
are
more
motives
for
crime
than
there
are
varieties
of
crime
if
there
is
a
motive
for
this
cockeyed
affair
and
i
yet
to
see
a
crime
without
a
motive
however
involved
or
simple
you
must
know
it
aside
from
spacecraft
stealing
that
ruled
out
then
i
be
eternally
relegated
to
the
nether
regions
if
i
know
what
it
is
stacey
nodded
maybe
you
know
it
and
do
recognize
it
maybe
i
should
visit
my
family
psychiatrist
he
might
be
able
to
ferret
out
the
hidden
secret
but
i
waste
no
time
on
it
just
proceed
and
see
what
happens
like
another
busted
head
as
i
recall
it
hard
enough
paul
laughed
one
could
hardly
be
sour
in
stacey
presence
nothing
appeared
serious
to
the
detective
he
managed
to
make
everything
sound
quite
cheerful
and
amusing
even
the
threat
of
further
depredations
it
was
a
trait
disliked
by
many
people
which
was
probably
the
main
reason
why
stacey
was
a
small
time
operator
instead
of
being
the
mainspring
of
a
agency
it
took
a
long
acquaintanceship
with
stacey
before
people
realized
that
the
light
banter
was
only
a
false
front
used
to
keep
stacey
own
spirits
from
bogging
down
in
the
world
of
trouble
a
sympathetic
sort
himself
stacey
forced
himself
to
treat
every
case
as
impersonally
as
he
could
because
only
a
man
uninvolved
emotionally
can
make
clear
decisions
based
on
fact
and
not
feelings
newcomers
meeting
stacey
resented
the
fact
that
the
detective
obviously
treated
their
troubles
as
less
than
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
but
paul
grayson
knew
stacey
well
and
he
was
willing
to
let
the
detective
handle
the
case
completely
from
this
point
knowing
that
stacey
would
do
it
honestly
and
quickly
friend
or
not
paul
waved
at
the
door
and
drove
towards
home
he
went
in
and
sat
down
ticking
things
off
on
the
fingers
of
his
hand
one
identification
cleared
two
wallet
returned
three
started
four
grayson
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
the
spaceport
was
connected
with
the
calculations
department
grayson
he
said
how
for
my
course
this
evening
sure
you
want
to
go
came
the
dry
retort
absolutely
want
to
bet
look
grunted
grayson
no
longer
angry
at
the
voice
you
got
a
fine
calculating
gadget
there
why
not
have
it
figure
out
the
betting
possibilities
and
make
book
on
me
we
tried
to
make
it
pick
horses
for
us
once
but
the
answer
came
back
as
incomplete
factors
uncertain
the
elecalc
does
not
like
horses
but
i
not
a
horse
i
hear
there
a
woman
tied
up
in
this
thing
that
the
predictably
unpredictable
factor
that
men
the
imbeciles
will
get
involved
with
women
even
as
you
and
i
anyway
grayson
we
have
you
a
course
it
wo
be
as
cold
turkey
as
last
night
but
it
will
serve
in
a
way
in
what
way
asked
paul
we
ca
set
the
spotter
ship
not
enough
time
you
have
to
aim
the
ship
visually
it
make
the
somewhat
large
i
do
mind
good
thing
you
do
came
the
glum
reply
both
of
them
knew
that
the
job
of
aiming
a
stellar
ship
was
accepted
by
the
public
as
one
of
the
things
that
had
to
be
done
few
of
them
knew
what
went
into
the
job
all
stars
are
but
pinpoints
in
the
sky
there
is
no
quick
way
to
tell
a
star
from
a
distant
star
by
visual
inspection
to
the
untrained
even
the
solar
planets
blend
with
the
interstellar
reaches
only
the
trained
eye
can
tell
planets
from
the
stars
by
the
lack
of
twinkle
the
true
distances
between
the
stars
is
too
vast
to
be
comprehended
men
speak
of
light
years
yet
even
the
learned
must
indulge
in
quite
a
bit
of
cerebration
to
understand
the
length
of
a
year
the
velocity
of
light
presents
figures
too
extreme
for
comprehension
light
travels
at
yards
per
millionth
of
a
second
yards
can
be
grasped
as
a
distance
of
fields
but
a
millionth
of
a
second
can
not
be
grasped
readily
miles
per
second
offers
only
one
factor
capable
of
being
understood
one
can
count
and
realize
that
a
second
has
passed
but
the
mind
is
incapable
of
grasping
the
fact
that
during
that
time
of
counting
a
beam
of
light
traverses
miles
proxima
centauri
is
four
light
years
away
using
the
longest
base
that
the
solar
system
provided
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
aimed
course
was
like
trying
to
hit
a
match
head
at
ten
thousand
yards
with
a
pistol
a
misalignment
too
minute
for
the
eye
to
see
meant
a
probable
target
dispersion
as
broad
as
the
outer
orbits
of
the
solar
system
aim
a
ship
at
a
target
four
light
years
away
across
aiming
points
a
couple
of
light
hours
apart
at
a
velocity
within
a
couple
of
percent
of
precise
multiplied
by
a
number
of
seconds
mounting
into
five
or
six
figures
you
can
establish
the
volume
which
will
contain
the
spacecraft
on
its
arrival
a
volume
of
probabilities
far
far
from
the
idea
of
a
precise
science
heading
as
he
was
for
proxima
centauri
that
tiny
star
would
be
the
focus
of
his
aim
but
proxima
is
a
tiny
star
one
of
a
trinary
and
the
other
two
magnificent
stars
overwhelmed
the
feeble
light
of
proxima
so
the
system
of
alpha
centauri
would
lie
on
the
of
telescope
and
the
of
the
telescope
would
be
displaced
from
the
axis
of
drive
by
a
small
angle
it
was
this
angle
that
required
the
use
of
the
electronic
calculator
not
only
because
proxima
lies
a
smidgin
of
space
apart
from
the
more
brilliant
pair
but
because
alpha
centauri
drifts
along
in
the
galactic
swing
and
sol
moves
as
well
the
eye
sees
alpha
centauri
where
it
was
four
years
ago
any
trip
across
space
lasting
ten
days
must
bring
the
traveller
down
out
of
supervelocity
and
into
the
realm
of
visibility
at
the
position
where
alpha
will
be
ten
days
after
not
where
alpha
was
four
years
ago
this
was
a
problem
not
yet
licked
like
the
of
a
brand
new
pistol
each
shot
fired
added
to
the
knowledge
of
the
correction
factor
that
must
be
applied
for
the
same
reasons
of
inward
anxiety
that
makes
a
man
who
has
missed
a
train
on
monday
turn
up
two
hours
early
on
tuesday
paul
turned
up
at
the
spaceport
early
the
guard
greeted
him
with
a
cynical
smile
but
checked
the
identification
carefully
before
waving
him
through
the
gate
paul
went
to
the
elecalc
office
to
get
his
folder
of
the
usual
procedure
was
to
have
the
course
calculated
as
early
as
possible
before
the
date
of
so
that
the
busy
department
could
sandwich
in
between
the
longer
range
jobs
this
was
different
undoubtedly
some
job
had
been
stopped
in
so
that
paul
course
could
be
run
off
he
was
not
too
surprised
to
have
the
man
at
the
desk
smile
and
point
a
finger
at
the
superintendent
office
and
say
it
in
there
go
on
in
he
expecting
you
paul
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
then
swallowed
a
lump
as
large
as
his
fist
the
man
sitting
quietly
behind
the
desk
huge
hands
folded
in
his
lap
was
chadwick
haedaecker
chapter
chadwick
haedaecker
was
the
kind
of
man
who
collected
college
degrees
both
earned
and
honorary
and
had
them
lettered
on
his
office
door
like
a
collection
of
trophies
he
had
enough
ability
and
ambition
to
get
to
the
top
of
his
particular
heap
and
once
he
got
there
he
had
garnered
enough
additional
power
to
stay
there
he
was
a
tall
man
with
piercing
eyes
and
an
indomitable
nature
and
he
used
both
to
quell
any
objectors
to
his
plans
projects
ideas
and
theories
twenty
years
of
authority
in
a
position
where
no
man
was
permitted
to
doubt
his
word
or
argue
with
his
proclamations
had
completely
erased
any
trace
of
humility
he
ever
had
but
whether
haedaecker
was
a
prince
among
men
or
a
jackal
among
jackals
depended
entirely
upon
the
beholder
when
haedaecker
believed
in
your
idea
he
was
a
staunch
supporter
throwing
all
he
had
and
he
had
plenty
behind
your
idea
his
whip
cracked
just
as
hard
in
your
behalf
as
it
lashed
against
your
back
when
haedaecker
was
not
convinced
of
the
soundness
of
your
idea
since
haedaecker
was
head
of
the
bureau
his
presence
here
made
paul
blink
while
paul
tried
to
think
of
something
clever
to
say
haedaecker
smiled
and
nodded
finally
speaking
after
he
knew
the
state
of
discomfiture
of
his
employee
you
had
quite
a
time
have
you
asked
haedaecker
paul
nodded
ruefully
just
what
happened
paul
explained
carefully
completely
he
would
have
preferred
to
answer
haedaecker
with
nods
or
grunts
or
shakes
of
the
head
on
the
theory
that
opening
the
mouth
is
the
first
step
towards
spilling
the
whole
tale
or
at
least
enough
of
it
to
give
a
man
as
cagey
as
haedaecker
to
think
that
there
was
more
equipment
in
the
burast
spacecraft
than
radio
beacon
checking
gear
haedaecker
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
come
forth
to
console
a
man
especially
one
that
apparently
came
out
of
the
deal
with
nothing
lost
haedaecker
principle
was
to
get
off
balance
and
keep
off
balance
because
when
they
off
balance
they
can
not
get
set
to
swing
paul
knew
that
he
would
have
to
play
this
interview
with
the
same
finesse
that
a
mouse
should
use
to
escape
the
cat
corner
have
any
ideas
about
this
asked
haedaecker
paul
ideas
were
all
confused
ones
but
he
did
not
say
so
the
police
accept
it
as
a
plain
case
of
attempted
theft
he
said
and
you
paul
spread
his
hands
in
a
universal
gesture
i
ca
make
more
out
of
it
than
the
police
he
said
haedaecker
speared
paul
grayson
with
those
piercing
eyes
you
not
mixed
up
in
anything
are
you
lord
no
haedaecker
glare
lessened
i
do
mean
anything
lawless
or
underhanded
paul
looked
at
haedaecker
coldly
then
what
else
haedaecker
smiled
blandly
you
are
an
ambitious
young
man
you
are
idealistic
you
are
enthusiastic
and
energetic
you
are
also
determined
are
those
unfavorable
traits
asked
paul
with
a
slight
edge
to
his
voice
he
hated
this
baiting
knew
that
he
should
take
the
sting
of
haedaecker
acid
tongue
without
flaring
back
haedaecker
had
paul
over
the
proverbial
barrel
from
which
position
there
is
little
chance
for
listen
to
me
snapped
haedaecker
you
were
twenty
four
when
you
came
to
this
department
two
years
later
you
came
to
me
with
an
idea
you
hoped
to
link
the
stars
by
voice
an
ideal
a
magnificent
hope
and
plan
for
mankind
on
earth
and
upon
neosol
for
years
everybody
who
has
had
a
touch
of
space
has
been
trying
testing
and
experimenting
towards
that
end
men
of
learning
both
abstract
and
concrete
men
who
have
spent
years
studying
that
very
idea
what
has
that
idea
got
to
do
with
my
getting
a
lump
on
the
head
queried
paul
only
this
as
a
member
of
this
department
you
were
given
a
job
to
do
you
have
proceeded
well
and
executed
this
job
proficiently
four
years
ago
grayson
i
told
you
that
the
experiments
you
suggested
had
been
tried
i
was
patient
i
explained
that
there
was
a
certain
appropriation
set
aside
for
communications
research
that
the
appropriation
intended
for
this
galactic
survey
was
under
no
circumstances
to
be
used
for
communications
i
remember
that
i
also
claim
that
my
experiments
have
never
been
tried
nonsense
i
accepted
your
theory
and
have
had
other
scientists
check
your
reasoning
they
state
that
there
is
no
relation
such
as
you
claim
now
to
get
back
to
the
correlation
between
that
crack
you
got
on
the
head
and
my
presence
here
it
goes
as
follows
until
last
evening
i
let
you
alone
i
knew
that
you
continued
to
hold
that
mad
theory
despite
arguments
against
it
but
a
man
can
have
his
dreams
and
so
i
permitted
you
to
dream
i
assumed
you
to
be
honest
i
believed
that
you
would
not
defy
orders
and
employ
funds
for
research
but
when
a
man
who
has
no
great
wealth
no
vengeful
enemies
no
polygonal
love
affairs
and
no
power
to
dispute
or
usurp
gets
involved
in
a
tangle
as
as
this
there
is
but
one
thing
left
i
am
convinced
that
you
are
planning
to
test
the
paul
laughed
bitterly
just
why
do
you
assume
that
this
is
some
sort
of
plot
why
not
accept
it
as
attempted
theft
as
the
police
do
if
i
were
a
thief
said
haedaecker
softly
and
managed
to
break
into
the
spaceport
i
would
not
wait
until
the
guards
came
after
me
then
to
drop
from
my
stolen
spacecraft
and
run
a
thief
does
not
need
the
spotter
craft
to
lay
his
course
he
takes
off
for
anywhere
so
long
as
it
is
off
and
away
a
man
contrived
to
resemble
you
closely
enough
to
pass
superficial
inspection
follows
you
before
the
clips
you
on
the
skull
and
steals
your
wallet
you
are
the
traditional
technician
grayson
you
do
not
dress
like
beau
brummel
nor
do
you
show
evidence
of
affluence
any
footpad
would
look
for
a
more
wealthy
client
he
knew
you
grayson
he
clipped
you
for
your
credentials
so
why
i
do
know
i
can
suggest
a
theory
because
he
knew
that
you
were
going
to
try
the
nonsense
haedaecker
smiled
with
a
wolfish
serenity
can
you
think
of
any
reason
why
any
man
would
want
to
put
a
monkey
wrench
into
our
plans
to
survey
the
galaxy
no
then
it
must
be
your
wild
schemes
but
just
the
same
question
doctor
haedaecker
if
i
were
going
against
orders
and
attempting
to
test
the
why
would
a
man
attempt
to
stop
me
you
are
an
idealistic
simpleton
snapped
haedaecker
you
have
a
manner
of
convincing
people
of
the
worth
of
whatever
idea
you
happen
to
hold
dear
despite
the
reams
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
you
have
the
enthusiasm
necessary
to
convince
people
who
have
not
the
truth
at
their
fingertips
of
the
validity
of
your
ideas
piling
supposition
upon
supposition
smiled
paul
cynically
if
that
has
been
done
i
fail
to
see
any
reason
why
any
man
would
not
want
to
be
linked
to
neosol
by
voice
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
human
nature
grayson
you
find
as
you
grow
older
that
whenever
someone
proposes
a
plan
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
there
are
violent
factions
that
will
work
hard
to
circumvent
it
how
many
leagues
of
united
nations
have
failed
throughout
history
because
of
jealousy
aggrandization
megalomania
both
personal
and
national
in
one
instance
after
the
bomb
convinced
all
men
that
uniting
as
one
was
the
smart
safe
sensible
thing
to
do
people
hailed
with
joy
the
creation
of
a
new
sovereign
state
apart
from
its
neighbors
another
nation
blocked
amity
because
of
an
ideology
a
third
nation
presented
a
territorial
possession
with
its
freedom
and
at
the
same
time
contemplated
the
addition
of
two
new
states
to
its
union
grayson
once
a
man
rises
above
his
daily
job
and
tries
to
set
up
something
beneficial
to
mankind
he
will
find
other
men
who
see
that
plan
as
a
threat
to
their
own
ambitions
paul
leaned
forward
over
the
desk
why
not
let
me
try
he
asked
eagerly
haedaecker
leaned
back
wearily
we
been
all
through
that
but
why
i
will
not
have
one
of
my
own
men
involved
in
an
experiment
as
ridiculous
as
yours
paul
eyed
haedaecker
quietly
but
haedaecker
shook
his
head
you
are
not
to
attempt
this
he
eyed
paul
angrily
who
says
i
am
demanded
paul
reason
and
logic
and
said
haedaecker
coldly
excepting
for
one
thing
i
go
out
and
inspect
that
ship
of
yours
for
gear
but
paul
grayson
is
smart
enough
to
smuggle
the
gear
on
earlier
trips
not
leaving
his
evidence
for
the
last
attempt
so
i
would
find
nothing
at
this
time
paul
felt
his
heart
pound
thrice
and
then
settle
down
again
the
one
thing
that
he
was
trying
to
avoid
was
not
going
to
come
off
but
haedaecker
glared
at
paul
once
again
i
absolutely
forbid
you
to
do
this
paul
glared
back
what
have
we
to
lose
i
not
have
the
ridicule
attendant
to
such
an
abortive
experiment
pinned
onto
my
department
paul
laughed
sarcastically
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
in
your
position
might
like
to
have
the
name
of
being
willing
to
have
himself
proven
wrong
what
do
you
mean
demanded
haedaecker
can
your
own
personal
ambition
be
great
enough
to
block
and
forestall
the
linking
of
sol
and
neosol
by
you
young
puppy
your
position
is
due
to
the
proposal
of
haedaecker
theory
said
paul
i
am
not
attempting
to
insult
you
doctor
haedaecker
i
want
you
to
view
this
in
another
light
according
to
all
of
the
evidence
at
hand
haedaecker
theory
is
correct
and
we
can
not
communicate
with
the
across
interstellar
space
the
proposition
of
that
theory
and
its
math
have
made
you
a
famous
man
perhaps
you
fear
that
if
haedaecker
theory
is
shown
to
be
incorrect
you
will
lose
your
position
this
is
not
so
men
have
always
been
on
the
side
of
a
great
man
who
was
humble
enough
to
doubt
his
own
theories
occasionally
who
was
willing
to
see
them
attacked
it
means
a
lot
to
mankind
show
mankind
that
your
personal
ambition
is
not
so
great
as
to
prevent
them
from
having
the
benefits
of
you
talking
as
though
you
knew
that
your
plan
would
be
successful
sneered
haedaecker
i
believe
it
will
be
if
i
am
given
the
opportunity
to
try
i
tell
you
that
it
will
not
and
i
forbid
you
to
try
haedaecker
speared
paul
with
a
glance
from
the
icy
eyes
you
understand
whether
or
not
the
experiment
might
be
successful
if
i
hear
of
your
trying
it
you
will
be
subjected
to
every
bit
of
punitive
action
that
the
law
permits
paul
leaned
back
easily
now
he
said
with
cool
candor
assuming
that
i
have
all
intention
of
attempting
it
without
official
permission
i
would
not
put
it
past
you
in
fact
i
believe
you
are
all
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
a
footpad
belted
me
and
swiped
my
wallet
yes
for
what
other
reason
theft
is
usually
done
for
haedaecker
stood
up
angrily
i
heard
enough
he
snapped
haedaecker
strode
to
the
door
and
hurled
it
open
with
one
swing
of
a
powerful
arm
what
happened
next
was
not
too
remote
a
coincidence
it
has
happened
to
everybody
several
times
someone
with
the
intention
of
entering
a
room
will
brace
themselves
turn
the
doorknob
and
thrust
only
to
have
the
door
opened
from
the
other
side
the
net
result
is
that
the
muscular
effort
tensed
to
strive
against
the
mass
and
inertia
of
the
door
will
find
its
force
expended
against
no
resistance
doors
are
pulled
from
one
side
and
pushed
from
the
other
if
the
shover
pushes
first
the
puller
gets
slapped
in
the
hand
with
the
doorknob
sometimes
resulting
in
a
broken
finger
or
thumb
but
if
the
puller
pulls
first
the
shover
finds
himself
catapulted
forward
by
his
own
muscular
effort
the
results
of
this
latter
can
be
both
comic
or
tragic
in
this
case
the
result
was
a
flurry
of
silk
a
bare
white
arm
a
fine
length
of
nylon
and
the
frightened
cry
of
a
woman
paul
gulped
haedaecker
reflexes
worked
fast
he
caught
nora
phillips
before
the
girl
went
headlong
to
the
floor
and
he
stood
her
up
retaining
a
light
grip
on
her
waist
until
she
got
her
bearings
and
her
breath
young
woman
stormed
haedaecker
angrily
are
you
used
to
bustling
into
closed
conferences
nora
looked
at
haedaecker
with
eyes
large
luminous
and
fetching
i
did
know
it
was
a
closed
conference
she
said
in
her
cool
contralto
i
most
sorry
miss
phillips
doctor
haedaecker
she
is
the
woman
i
met
last
night
doctor
haedaecker
what
are
you
doing
here
demanded
haedaecker
i
did
not
know
this
was
any
kind
of
conference
she
explained
i
came
to
see
mister
grayson
and
the
guard
said
he
was
in
this
room
talking
why
did
you
wait
stormed
haedaecker
nora
smiled
wanly
i
was
excited
she
said
it
may
have
occurred
to
you
too
that
the
man
who
tried
to
steal
mister
grayson
spacecraft
last
night
was
not
playing
a
game
everything
seemed
wrong
he
was
not
smart
i
got
to
wondering
why
he
just
did
get
into
the
ship
and
take
off
well
less
than
fifteen
minutes
ago
a
flash
came
over
the
air
among
the
news
was
the
statement
that
the
criminal
killed
last
night
in
attempted
spacecraft
theft
was
joel
walsh
he
was
an
escapee
from
penitentiary
in
antarctica
that
explained
it
how
demanded
haedaecker
does
that
explain
anything
of
course
it
does
said
nora
he
was
in
jail
for
ten
years
he
must
have
been
sent
away
when
he
was
about
twenty
how
many
men
are
competent
space
pilots
at
that
age
not
many
agreed
paul
and
being
in
jail
for
the
last
ten
years
it
natural
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
run
the
ship
um
grumbled
haedaecker
he
probably
wanted
to
stow
away
said
nora
once
he
did
that
he
could
hold
a
gun
at
the
pilot
head
and
make
the
pilot
do
his
bidding
until
he
learned
how
to
run
the
ship
there
was
one
very
fine
flaw
in
nora
reasoning
but
paul
did
not
want
to
belabor
this
point
at
this
moment
he
had
not
intended
to
push
haedaecker
to
the
point
of
firing
him
for
impertinence
insubordination
or
rank
carelessness
for
on
the
burast
was
the
gear
that
haedaecker
vindictive
nature
accused
him
of
stowing
away
paul
laughed
so
much
for
your
intrigue
he
said
haedaecker
glared
at
paul
angrily
your
intrigue
he
said
with
heavy
emphasis
on
the
first
word
just
let
me
find
you
trying
it
paul
smiled
crookedly
and
looked
haedaecker
in
the
eye
coldly
doctor
haedaecker
he
said
in
a
level
voice
if
i
ever
try
it
and
fail
no
one
will
know
of
my
failure
if
i
try
and
succeed
i
assure
you
that
you
will
be
able
to
do
nothing
to
me
haedaecker
nodded
his
manner
as
cold
as
paul
voice
had
been
the
gage
had
been
hurled
the
swords
measured
and
weighed
so
far
it
was
stalemate
but
only
until
paul
grayson
really
did
something
against
the
rules
large
enough
to
let
haedaecker
really
clip
him
deep
lasting
and
legally
justifiable
haedaecker
left
and
paul
turned
to
nora
phillips
she
smiled
at
him
and
asked
what
is
this
intrigue
business
or
is
it
a
top
secret
paul
shook
his
head
i
prefer
to
tell
you
after
i
return
do
that
she
said
i
like
to
hear
about
it
paul
pondered
briefly
the
obvious
thing
was
to
offer
her
a
chance
to
look
over
his
ship
he
could
do
that
now
that
he
had
all
of
his
credentials
and
papers
back
but
the
gear
was
evidence
against
him
and
even
though
it
was
parked
in
a
convenient
locker
certain
hunks
of
and
associated
bits
of
equipment
were
a
dead
giveaway
the
same
sort
of
evidence
in
the
shape
of
capped
pipes
will
tell
the
observer
that
plumbing
once
existed
in
a
certain
room
paul
had
no
intention
of
trusting
anybody
at
this
moment
mayhap
nora
timely
information
about
the
deceased
thief
were
true
still
there
was
a
hole
in
her
tale
if
the
thief
wanted
only
to
stow
away
until
time
he
would
pick
another
spacecraft
than
the
burast
the
registry
number
glowed
in
luminescent
paint
a
yard
high
and
matched
the
numbers
on
his
identification
card
certainly
no
would
try
to
stow
away
in
an
official
ship
that
was
almost
certain
to
be
investigated
as
soon
as
the
was
heard
he
suspected
haedaecker
hand
in
this
anything
to
keep
theory
in
high
gear
to
keep
haedaecker
top
man
in
his
field
he
might
as
well
suspect
nora
too
at
least
until
motive
or
innocence
could
be
shown
he
decided
to
lie
glibly
normally
i
could
take
you
aboard
and
show
you
the
crate
he
said
but
this
is
an
experimental
run
and
subject
to
security
though
i
not
be
able
to
explain
why
they
think
it
so
nora
laughed
and
shook
her
head
space
ships
are
cold
powerful
and
dangerous
things
to
me
she
said
i
feel
uncomfortable
on
one
of
them
then
let
me
show
you
the
elecalc
what
elecalc
short
word
for
electronic
calculator
i
here
to
get
an
aiming
point
for
my
trip
tonight
now
that
i
would
like
to
see
said
nora
hooking
an
arm
in
paul
chapter
i
pointing
for
alpha
centauri
said
paul
and
so
that
what
we
calculate
for
nora
looked
at
the
bays
of
neat
equipment
and
shook
her
head
why
not
aim
at
it
and
run
she
asked
surely
you
do
not
need
this
billion
dollars
worth
of
stuff
to
point
out
your
destination
we
do
objected
paul
you
see
if
i
took
off
with
my
telescope
pointed
along
the
axis
of
drive
with
the
pointing
at
alpha
centauri
i
be
heading
for
the
star
where
it
was
four
years
ago
i
intend
to
be
on
the
way
for
nine
days
so
i
want
to
point
the
nose
of
the
ship
at
the
spot
where
alpha
will
be
nine
days
in
the
future
instead
of
four
years
in
the
past
since
sol
and
alpha
drift
in
space
the
motion
and
velocities
of
both
systems
must
be
taken
into
account
a
found
and
then
used
to
aim
my
ship
my
telescope
will
angle
away
from
the
ship
axis
by
that
add
to
that
the
fact
that
i
am
taking
off
from
earth
which
will
give
me
some
angular
velocity
and
some
rotational
velocity
differing
from
an
hypothetical
from
sol
itself
furthermore
i
want
proxima
centauri
instead
of
alpha
and
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
too
then
there
is
the
question
of
velocity
and
time
we
can
not
see
when
we
are
exceeding
the
velocity
of
light
we
must
run
at
so
many
for
so
many
seconds
a
minor
error
in
timing
or
velocity
will
create
a
rather
gross
error
in
position
at
the
end
of
the
run
oh
said
nora
but
her
tone
indicated
a
lack
of
comprehension
paul
smiled
one
second
of
error
at
one
equals
a
hundred
and
thousand
miles
of
error
one
second
of
error
at
a
hundred
times
the
velocity
of
light
equals
eighteen
millions
of
miles
error
not
much
as
cosmic
distance
goes
but
a
long
way
to
walk
nora
understood
that
and
said
so
grayson
data
had
been
handed
to
him
by
haedaecker
but
apparently
the
calculations
that
had
been
temporarily
halted
were
still
halted
for
the
operator
was
taking
this
opportunity
of
feeding
some
future
information
to
the
big
machine
it
was
not
a
complex
calculation
as
some
computations
may
go
but
there
were
a
myriad
of
factors
terran
latitude
and
longitude
the
instant
of
as
applied
to
the
day
and
the
year
an
averaging
of
previous
noted
from
previous
trips
velocities
vector
angles
momentum
and
others
all
obtained
from
tables
and
entered
in
the
machine
before
the
start
lever
was
pulled
the
machine
mulled
the
information
over
tossed
electrons
back
and
forth
chewed
and
digested
a
ream
of
binary
digits
and
handed
forth
a
strip
of
paper
printed
with
an
entire
set
of
coordinates
in
decimal
angles
paul
showed
nora
his
folder
of
data
the
rest
he
said
is
up
to
me
he
led
nora
from
the
computation
room
intending
to
hit
the
dining
room
for
coffee
across
the
lobby
of
the
administration
building
he
was
hailed
by
the
autocall
he
went
to
the
telephone
it
was
stacey
i
a
couple
of
things
to
let
you
think
over
said
stacey
so
i
been
on
the
job
i
have
much
but
there
are
a
few
items
you
might
mull
over
shoot
one
your
deceased
thief
was
an
escaped
from
the
penal
colony
on
antarctica
this
i
heard
then
i
suppose
you
know
that
the
guy
was
cashiered
from
the
neoterra
run
for
smuggling
huh
blurted
paul
an
tossed
out
on
his
right
ear
for
conduct
hardly
becoming
a
safecracker
and
a
thief
let
alone
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
that
i
did
know
how
long
ago
five
years
almost
it
was
not
quite
the
ten
that
nora
had
claimed
well
that
makes
it
that
ai
all
came
stacey
voice
the
weapons
carried
by
the
spaceport
guards
are
regulation
police
positives
our
erstwhile
felon
was
shot
once
right
between
the
eyes
with
a
which
according
to
all
of
the
expert
opinion
came
from
an
automatic
at
a
distance
of
three
feet
plus
or
minus
six
inches
know
what
that
means
i
just
digesting
the
information
now
you
tell
me
it
means
that
the
was
killed
by
a
party
or
parties
unknown
someone
other
than
one
of
the
guards
furthermore
he
was
facing
his
executioner
not
taking
it
on
the
lam
how
do
you
make
that
it
does
make
good
sense
sure
it
does
it
keystones
nicely
men
of
that
calibre
are
often
chilled
because
they
fumble
a
job
and
the
mainspring
does
enjoy
the
prospect
of
having
a
fumbler
running
around
with
information
that
might
lead
to
the
capture
arrest
conviction
demise
of
aforementioned
mainspring
they
made
one
error
they
should
have
used
a
revolver
instead
of
a
automatic
the
is
a
gangster
weapon
and
they
should
have
drilled
their
from
behind
between
the
scapulae
to
make
it
look
as
though
the
guards
were
better
shots
than
they
really
are
that
food
for
thought
said
paul
that
is
all
said
stacey
here
one
more
bit
of
information
that
may
be
either
juicy
or
full
of
sawdust
depending
upon
how
you
taste
it
your
girl
friend
nora
phillips
was
born
and
raised
on
neoterra
you
certain
of
that
so
the
bureau
of
vital
statistics
claims
but
how
negative
evidence
my
fine
scientist
negative
evidence
i
offer
you
two
alternatives
either
she
was
born
on
neoterra
or
she
is
employing
an
alias
pseudonym
or
nom
de
jour
stacey
french
lacked
a
certain
vocabulary
but
it
was
none
the
less
to
the
point
she
is
certainly
not
born
nora
phillips
of
terra
i
let
you
pick
your
choice
but
enough
of
that
a
couple
of
hours
ago
she
received
a
telephone
call
nice
position
she
must
have
she
chinned
for
about
three
minutes
and
then
leaped
to
her
feet
and
took
off
like
jet
propelled
did
bother
to
say
anything
to
the
management
of
the
joint
at
all
then
where
does
she
work
asked
paul
timothy
mcbride
and
webster
we
could
tap
their
telephone
but
we
had
a
peering
at
her
through
a
telescope
from
a
room
in
the
building
opposite
hers
what
did
he
catch
nothing
she
just
listened
and
then
took
off
and
can
that
dame
drive
if
we
did
have
an
idea
of
where
she
was
going
after
the
first
few
minutes
my
man
would
have
lost
her
for
certain
she
with
you
now
paul
thought
fast
just
what
unearthly
reason
why
people
would
try
to
stop
his
plans
for
creating
communications
with
neosol
paul
could
not
fathom
obviously
there
was
one
faction
working
against
him
but
how
had
they
paul
paled
had
the
criminal
hoped
to
lay
paul
low
enough
to
keep
him
quiet
until
the
criminal
could
take
off
in
paul
place
true
identification
would
be
impossible
once
the
crook
were
in
space
but
what
could
he
accomplish
certainly
suppose
the
thief
that
clipped
him
intended
to
place
paul
in
a
position
where
he
could
be
captured
easily
to
take
paul
place
to
perform
certain
acts
in
paul
name
while
paul
was
held
captive
then
once
these
acts
were
consummated
paul
could
be
found
in
the
wreck
of
a
spacecraft
or
the
ruin
of
a
radio
beacon
on
proxima
centauri
i
but
why
columbus
had
been
kicked
around
for
having
screwy
ideas
and
the
brothers
wright
had
been
thoroughly
but
people
did
not
try
to
murder
characters
who
had
cockeyed
ideas
of
course
there
was
galileo
but
galileo
had
publicized
his
screwy
ideas
whereas
paul
grayson
theories
were
known
to
very
few
but
nora
phillips
could
not
be
held
as
part
of
that
particular
mob
it
seemed
to
paul
that
the
woman
had
done
a
fine
job
towards
keeping
paul
hale
hearty
healthy
and
imbued
with
ideas
available
only
to
a
man
in
the
finest
of
health
of
mind
and
body
if
nora
belonged
to
some
group
intent
on
stopping
paul
grayson
she
was
working
against
them
too
for
she
had
done
a
fine
job
of
smoothing
the
headache
out
of
his
skull
with
fingers
that
acted
with
experience
and
practise
on
the
other
hand
nora
phillips
had
behaved
as
though
she
wanted
paul
to
succeed
and
she
acted
if
this
were
an
act
as
though
she
enjoyed
her
work
so
what
had
really
happened
last
night
when
paul
grayson
was
clipped
unconscious
had
nora
forestalled
them
nora
was
quite
a
woman
her
loveliness
was
not
of
the
untouchable
fragile
bandbox
variety
perfection
that
must
not
be
marred
by
a
misplaced
hair
or
a
wrinkle
in
the
frock
or
a
clue
of
rouge
printed
offset
from
her
own
ripe
lips
to
her
own
smooth
cheek
by
paul
nora
was
woman
and
neither
complete
dishabille
nor
minor
imperfection
would
mar
her
appeal
paul
recalled
the
lithe
slenderness
of
her
body
her
sculptured
arms
were
molded
with
the
smooth
well
balanced
muscle
of
fine
tonus
her
waist
was
slender
but
not
too
soft
hey
are
you
there
yeah
stacey
i
was
thinking
do
think
so
hard
look
stacey
can
you
tell
me
whether
the
man
who
clipped
me
turned
up
with
scratches
on
his
face
i
do
know
why
just
a
loose
end
i
might
be
able
to
find
out
take
a
swing
at
it
but
it
not
too
important
okay
paul
have
i
given
you
something
to
think
about
more
than
said
paul
soberly
he
hung
up
turned
and
saw
the
guard
of
the
previous
evening
standing
near
by
about
to
go
on
duty
paul
went
over
and
asked
hi
hello
say
i
sorry
about
last
night
forget
it
you
were
doing
your
duty
but
can
you
tell
me
did
the
guy
who
used
my
identification
last
night
have
any
scratches
on
his
face
the
guard
frowned
in
thought
all
he
had
was
some
and
a
fine
job
it
was
too
he
looked
me
right
in
the
eye
no
marks
not
a
trace
paul
smiled
and
went
back
to
nora
thinking
furiously
something
must
have
interfered
with
their
little
plan
he
looked
at
nora
lissome
lovely
as
lithe
as
a
tiger
all
desirable
but
maybe
it
might
be
a
good
idea
for
him
to
learn
her
desires
to
ascertain
her
limit
before
he
took
any
liberties
with
her
beautiful
white
body
intelligent
women
did
not
scream
or
faint
these
days
nor
did
they
rake
their
attacker
with
fingernails
they
employed
judo
now
if
nora
phillips
knew
judo
it
was
plausible
that
the
erstwhile
footpad
instead
of
finding
an
inert
victim
and
an
hysterical
woman
discovered
that
the
woman
was
capable
of
defending
her
outraged
dignity
revenging
their
cowardly
attack
and
thwarting
any
further
plans
the
criminal
held
for
them
both
it
would
explain
in
part
why
the
criminal
little
idea
did
not
culminate
as
expected
if
nora
phillips
knew
judo
paul
smiled
faintly
he
had
not
changed
his
mind
about
nora
phillips
she
was
still
the
type
of
woman
that
would
react
unfavorably
to
any
crude
attempt
at
approach
regardless
of
whether
her
interest
in
him
were
an
act
swift
passion
or
the
awakening
of
tender
love
paul
knew
that
she
would
not
employ
the
punishing
judo
holds
upon
him
if
she
knew
judo
on
the
other
hand
paul
believed
that
instinct
might
react
faster
than
intellect
and
that
her
first
instinctive
move
would
give
her
away
so
paul
took
her
hand
as
he
came
close
to
her
he
drew
her
forward
his
free
arm
gliding
towards
her
waist
and
around
it
nora
free
hand
moved
forward
upward
touched
his
cheek
and
then
went
on
around
his
neck
the
hand
that
he
held
came
free
and
joined
the
other
she
was
warm
and
supple
in
his
arms
and
her
lips
were
soft
and
clinging
it
was
a
satisfying
emotional
experience
intellectually
it
proved
nothing
that
had
not
been
empirical
knowledge
for
a
couple
of
millions
of
years
paul
would
never
learn
whether
nora
knew
judo
by
that
method
he
abandoned
his
primary
intrigue
for
the
moment
and
indulged
in
one
of
his
favorite
indoor
sports
then
she
moved
back
a
bit
and
paul
hands
slipped
to
either
side
of
her
waist
i
could
learn
to
like
this
sort
of
thing
he
said
nora
looked
up
into
his
eyes
her
own
eyes
were
a
trifle
dreamy
but
a
trace
of
smile
lurked
in
the
deep
corners
of
her
mouth
but
how
do
i
know
you
be
true
to
me
she
asked
him
in
a
voice
that
sounded
like
pure
soap
opera
in
space
i
a
dame
in
every
port
he
told
her
i
true
to
all
but
why
so
many
chuckled
nora
variety
paul
let
go
of
nora
waist
and
she
stepped
back
a
bit
he
turned
around
and
started
leading
her
the
rest
of
the
way
towards
the
coffee
shop
i
a
couple
of
hours
left
he
said
i
prefer
to
soak
up
some
dinner
in
candlelight
with
music
et
al
but
ptomaine
joe
is
handy
i
hit
so
many
snags
so
far
that
i
inclined
to
find
me
an
advantage
and
then
sit
on
it
until
i
safe
in
space
nora
shuddered
a
bit
safe
in
space
she
said
softly
that
a
strange
thing
to
say
why
he
asked
so
far
out
there
away
from
the
friendly
earth
nothing
solid
to
stand
upon
nothing
to
paul
laughed
no
footpads
to
raise
lumps
on
the
skull
no
taxicabs
to
dodge
no
no
women
to
kiss
you
convinced
me
but
i
baffled
by
you
what
kind
of
job
do
you
hold
why
it
is
everybody
that
can
pick
up
and
leave
their
work
for
an
idle
afternoon
oh
and
her
laugh
was
genuine
i
librarian
for
a
large
office
of
lawyers
i
can
get
away
because
of
polite
confusion
no
matter
who
misses
me
he
assumes
that
i
am
looking
up
a
batch
of
stuff
for
one
of
the
others
there
are
so
many
of
them
that
they
could
possibly
get
their
heads
together
close
enough
to
check
up
actually
i
doing
just
that
often
enough
so
that
i
can
play
hookey
once
in
a
while
and
not
get
caught
paul
laughed
with
nora
he
felt
at
ease
with
her
and
her
presence
made
him
forget
all
of
the
niggling
little
questions
that
bothered
him
time
passed
swiftly
enough
to
surprise
them
both
when
the
announcer
called
the
time
and
number
of
paul
spaceflight
this
is
it
he
said
ruefully
so
it
is
she
agreed
there
another
day
i
call
for
it
when
i
get
back
do
that
she
said
it
was
not
a
tone
of
command
it
was
more
a
tone
of
absolute
agreement
it
pleased
him
raging
vegan
gorgons
could
stop
me
he
chuckled
he
reached
for
her
and
she
went
into
his
arms
forward
for
a
kiss
paul
made
the
most
of
it
gave
it
all
he
knew
how
to
give
and
for
his
efforts
he
received
a
pleasant
promise
for
the
future
in
return
nora
leaned
back
in
his
arms
took
his
hands
from
around
her
waist
and
turned
him
to
face
the
spaceport
door
it
that
way
she
said
in
a
throaty
voice
she
gave
him
a
gentle
shove
he
went
through
the
door
and
out
upon
the
spacefield
walking
across
the
sandy
floor
towards
the
spacecraft
numbered
burast
actually
the
spacecraft
was
quite
close
to
the
shape
of
a
hen
egg
it
stood
upon
its
smaller
end
supported
by
four
heavy
vanes
that
held
the
drivers
above
them
the
bulge
of
the
hull
swelled
out
in
the
gentle
curve
and
about
the
place
where
the
gourmet
cuts
the
top
off
of
his
breakfast
food
the
hard
metal
stopped
and
the
upper
curving
dome
of
the
spacecraft
was
made
of
window
not
a
clear
expanse
of
glass
but
more
like
the
greenhouse
roof
small
facets
set
between
rigid
girders
in
a
neat
and
efficient
pattern
the
girders
were
reasonably
heavy
because
each
one
held
shutter
flaps
that
would
snap
closed
if
the
pane
of
glass
beside
it
became
pierced
because
of
contact
with
cosmic
detritus
at
the
very
top
of
this
dome
the
glass
was
a
smooth
sheet
polished
and
unbroken
this
section
a
full
ten
feet
in
diameter
was
optically
perfect
for
through
this
dome
of
glass
the
spacecraft
was
aimed
if
the
stars
actually
were
where
they
looked
to
be
to
the
eye
there
would
have
been
something
less
of
a
problem
a
set
of
precision
set
along
the
axis
of
ship
drive
could
be
used
as
a
aiming
point
like
a
ship
near
the
shore
the
bow
could
be
aimed
at
the
pier
the
power
set
and
then
the
rest
would
take
care
of
itself
but
stars
move
in
their
heavenly
way
a
poor
ten
to
fifty
miles
per
second
can
become
a
rather
awesome
gulf
after
four
years
alpha
centauri
is
a
little
more
than
four
light
years
away
that
means
that
the
star
as
seen
by
the
naked
eye
will
be
quite
some
distance
from
where
it
really
is
students
of
trigonometry
will
understand
a
second
of
arc
will
subtend
a
cosmic
sine
at
the
end
of
four
light
years
to
help
the
pilot
the
spotter
was
used
the
spotter
was
a
tender
spacecraft
that
roamed
the
solar
system
far
out
from
sol
two
light
hours
away
it
was
when
one
of
the
star
ships
was
scheduled
to
fly
the
elecalc
would
compute
the
course
and
the
big
telescopes
would
direct
the
spotter
spacecraft
via
the
until
the
distant
ship
was
directly
in
the
line
of
aim
between
terra
and
the
calculated
spot
in
the
heavens
where
the
distant
star
would
be
at
the
end
of
the
flying
time
once
the
spotter
was
properly
located
two
hours
before
the
time
the
spotter
would
emit
an
atomic
spotlight
for
a
half
hour
two
hours
later
the
light
from
this
immense
searchlight
would
arrive
at
terra
to
provide
an
aiming
point
for
the
space
pilot
the
ship
could
take
off
on
this
line
of
sight
aiming
for
it
directly
of
course
by
the
time
the
space
travelling
ship
reached
the
spot
the
spotter
craft
would
have
moved
aside
the
light
would
have
ceased
and
the
star
ship
was
heading
for
deep
space
with
nothing
to
impede
its
course
paul
was
handicapped
the
spotter
was
not
available
lacking
the
spotter
to
use
as
a
point
of
aim
paul
was
forced
to
choose
the
aiming
telescope
in
the
dome
instead
of
the
more
precise
on
the
this
added
to
the
error
and
to
add
once
more
to
that
error
was
the
fact
that
spacecraft
in
flight
tend
to
revolve
along
their
driving
axis
so
that
the
angle
between
the
true
line
of
flight
and
the
aiming
point
changed
in
angle
paul
would
have
to
use
alpha
centauri
itself
as
a
the
was
supplied
by
the
observatory
and
applied
to
the
aiming
telescope
in
the
dome
a
lot
of
minute
errors
that
added
up
to
a
gross
at
the
end
of
flight
basically
the
job
of
the
galactic
survey
would
remove
one
of
the
errors
that
of
the
crude
measurement
of
distance
between
the
stars
themselves
paul
was
a
good
pilot
he
cut
the
close
and
watched
it
in
the
until
it
disappeared
he
was
now
in
that
blackness
that
surrounded
every
ship
during
the
speed
he
was
on
his
way
nothing
to
do
for
two
weeks
but
wait
for
the
course
to
end
nothing
to
do
but
to
sit
and
think
and
plan
and
dream
to
think
of
haedaecker
and
the
to
plan
for
the
future
when
his
discoveries
brought
him
fame
and
fortune
to
dream
of
nora
phillips
paul
began
to
hum
and
after
a
moment
or
two
the
humming
broke
out
into
a
but
dubious
baritone
and
round
and
round
go
the
deuterons
round
and
round
the
magnet
swings
round
and
round
and
round
go
the
deuterons
smack
in
the
target
go
the
microamps
chapter
buried
in
the
loose
powdery
dust
that
covered
proxima
centauri
i
a
spacecraft
lay
concealed
ten
miles
across
the
blazing
flatlands
of
dust
galactic
survey
station
i
was
clearly
visible
from
the
station
the
spacecraft
blended
so
well
with
the
dust
that
it
could
not
be
seen
only
a
sharp
observer
who
knew
where
to
look
and
what
to
look
for
could
have
seen
the
turret
of
the
spacecraft
lofting
above
the
dusty
plains
the
machine
rifle
would
have
been
invisible
to
the
sharpest
of
eye
several
miles
to
the
other
side
of
the
survey
station
there
were
a
group
of
furrows
in
the
plain
where
from
the
machine
rifle
had
landed
a
television
detector
was
set
upon
the
area
between
the
concrete
landing
deck
and
the
main
spacelock
of
the
survey
station
so
that
any
erect
moving
object
that
intersected
the
would
cause
the
machine
rifle
to
fire
so
that
its
projectiles
would
pass
through
the
moving
object
the
man
in
the
hidden
spacecraft
had
been
playing
solitaire
for
day
upon
day
the
record
of
his
score
on
the
wall
of
the
ship
was
long
and
not
too
honest
eventually
the
rang
and
he
dropped
his
cards
he
ran
to
shut
off
all
of
the
detecting
equipment
because
detecting
equipment
itself
could
be
in
turn
detected
and
he
wanted
no
reprisals
he
set
his
eye
to
the
telescope
and
watched
the
new
arrival
paul
grayson
landed
his
ship
on
the
concrete
apron
and
donned
space
attire
for
his
walk
across
the
airless
planet
to
the
station
he
came
from
his
ship
and
though
he
had
seen
it
countless
times
before
paul
paused
to
view
the
beauty
of
the
airless
midnight
sky
he
looked
for
sol
hidden
in
the
starry
curtain
he
looked
at
proxima
a
tiny
star
but
utterly
brilliant
at
this
distance
it
blinded
him
luckily
the
beautiful
binary
of
alpha
centauri
was
behind
the
little
planet
and
he
was
saved
the
hurt
of
looking
at
that
brilliance
with
the
same
thrill
of
anticipation
he
had
enjoyed
for
day
upon
day
now
paul
turned
from
his
ship
and
started
to
walk
toward
the
station
what
he
might
learn
there
would
change
the
thinking
of
the
galaxy
it
was
the
culmination
of
years
of
thought
and
experimentation
it
was
the
crux
of
the
matter
the
final
evidence
that
would
give
paul
the
weight
and
the
conviction
from
here
he
could
go
on
and
up
here
now
at
any
rate
soon
was
the
incontrovertible
truth
he
checked
his
gear
thoroughly
but
it
was
force
of
habit
caused
by
the
desire
of
his
own
safety
he
had
planned
well
he
had
forgotten
nothing
he
chuckled
happily
he
had
forgotten
nothing
the
lissome
sweetness
of
nora
phillips
and
the
promise
of
complete
fulfillment
was
sweet
recollection
when
paul
returned
to
terra
he
would
have
the
world
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
to
hold
tightly
and
give
to
nora
his
eye
caught
a
bit
of
glitter
in
the
dust
of
proxima
i
and
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
because
nora
might
like
a
crystal
from
a
far
planet
he
did
not
hear
the
passage
of
bullets
over
his
bent
back
because
proxima
i
possessed
no
air
to
carry
their
sound
he
could
not
hear
the
cursing
of
the
man
in
the
spacecraft
hidden
ten
miles
across
the
dusty
plain
nor
could
he
see
the
frantic
effort
to
readjust
the
sighting
mechanism
of
the
machine
rifle
five
thousand
feet
per
second
was
the
muzzle
velocity
of
the
rifle
in
space
and
because
there
was
no
impeding
air
the
bullets
had
taken
two
seconds
to
travel
from
gun
to
target
position
in
those
two
seconds
paul
bent
over
causing
the
burst
of
fire
to
miss
there
was
no
second
fullisade
the
enemy
had
had
too
little
time
to
readjust
his
sights
the
enemy
had
also
been
overconfident
so
had
not
prepared
for
a
miss
the
radio
was
silent
only
the
crackle
of
cosmic
static
came
from
the
speaker
to
show
that
it
was
alive
the
was
even
more
silent
for
there
was
no
interfering
cosmic
energies
to
make
static
paul
set
up
the
test
equipment
and
checked
both
they
were
obviously
and
awaiting
the
arrival
of
some
signal
in
order
to
burst
into
life
then
he
settled
back
to
wait
how
long
paul
could
not
tell
actually
the
measurement
of
this
matter
was
the
basic
reason
for
paul
being
here
the
books
set
alpha
centauri
at
light
years
from
sol
ergo
a
beam
of
light
or
a
radio
wave
should
take
years
from
transmission
to
reception
ten
percent
error
would
cause
a
variable
of
almost
five
months
an
error
of
one
percent
adds
up
to
two
weeks
the
observatories
had
admitted
an
error
of
one
percent
as
a
maximum
and
considerable
space
travel
between
proxima
i
and
terra
had
diminished
this
error
to
an
absolute
of
about
three
days
plus
or
minus
the
nominal
paul
had
been
gratified
to
discover
that
despite
his
delayed
he
had
arrived
at
proxima
before
the
radio
signal
arrived
from
terra
paul
had
been
worried
about
his
delay
and
he
had
driven
his
ship
hard
not
during
the
days
of
travel
of
course
but
after
paul
had
come
down
out
of
the
blackness
and
could
set
a
course
by
inspection
he
had
been
either
lucky
or
proficient
even
using
a
not
too
precise
method
of
aiming
his
ship
he
had
still
emerged
from
the
blackness
less
than
five
million
miles
from
proxima
which
was
very
good
aiming
indeed
pilots
always
aimed
for
their
target
on
the
nose
for
one
thing
the
dispersion
was
huge
because
the
slightest
irregularity
in
any
phase
of
the
maneuver
would
throw
off
the
point
of
aim
by
millions
of
miles
in
years
and
years
of
spaceflight
the
first
direct
hit
upon
target
had
yet
to
be
recorded
in
fact
five
million
miles
was
considered
brilliant
piloting
or
as
is
more
possible
it
was
brilliant
luck
then
as
paul
found
his
he
had
pushed
the
burast
hard
enough
to
make
her
plates
creak
and
paul
had
descended
at
a
full
four
gravities
all
the
way
to
the
ground
he
had
arrived
before
the
radio
signal
had
reached
the
planet
and
that
was
all
he
cared
about
so
he
settled
back
to
wait
there
was
little
to
do
but
sit
and
think
and
to
watch
the
occasional
meteor
shower
land
on
the
dusty
ground
there
had
been
an
extensive
shower
about
ten
miles
from
the
station
shortly
after
his
arrival
the
impact
was
of
course
both
invisible
and
inaudible
but
upon
impact
the
dust
spurted
upwards
billowing
and
flowing
like
the
column
in
miniature
that
came
from
an
atom
bomb
explosion
since
there
was
no
air
on
proxima
i
the
billowing
dust
rose
and
spread
apart
until
the
individual
dust
mote
lost
its
energy
and
fell
back
to
proxima
i
by
gravitational
attraction
he
would
have
liked
to
inspect
that
particular
spot
because
the
shower
had
been
spectacular
a
number
of
meteors
in
a
group
had
landed
sending
forth
a
series
of
dusty
columns
some
of
the
larger
of
which
were
still
visible
when
the
radio
chattered
into
life
three
days
after
his
arrival
it
came
all
at
once
and
its
sound
dinned
his
ears
and
from
the
smooth
walls
of
the
station
the
sound
snapped
paul
from
his
place
by
the
it
grated
on
his
ears
until
he
could
rush
downstairs
to
the
radio
room
to
turn
the
control
down
so
that
the
audio
signal
fell
below
the
overload
point
from
a
raucous
screech
the
volume
fell
until
distortion
no
longer
fouled
up
the
filtered
purity
of
the
broadcast
from
terra
four
years
ago
paul
measured
the
signal
strength
and
found
it
entirely
satisfactory
he
coupled
the
recorders
to
the
gear
and
then
settled
back
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
modulated
timing
signals
that
were
transmitted
after
an
interval
of
straight
tone
the
first
period
to
be
used
for
establishing
contact
before
the
actual
timing
of
the
began
once
the
radio
signal
was
coming
in
perfectly
paul
turned
his
attention
to
the
receiver
he
tuned
it
gingerly
cautiously
and
then
it
came
to
life
paul
cried
in
exultation
his
was
success
true
it
was
a
weakling
signal
that
faded
and
died
at
times
but
it
came
in
strong
and
clear
enough
for
recording
in
the
periods
of
good
reception
a
bit
of
work
and
research
and
the
construction
of
a
real
interstellar
station
would
remove
this
fading
paul
snapped
the
extra
recorder
on
and
then
began
to
dream
his
dream
again
this
time
more
strong
than
ever
before
he
had
connected
the
equipment
at
terra
central
to
the
big
interstellar
radio
transmitter
lacking
a
transmitter
for
his
own
use
so
that
now
he
was
hearing
the
terran
end
of
conversation
it
was
a
woman
voice
that
talked
from
terra
to
someone
currently
on
one
of
the
planetary
outposts
of
sol
but
it
wo
be
long
my
dear
of
course
it
seems
so
do
that
by
all
means
in
a
month
you
say
i
very
happy
about
that
here
the
signal
faded
for
a
full
minute
it
returned
again
terry
said
so
how
do
i
know
by
all
means
my
dear
and
here
again
the
signal
faded
but
it
was
enough
exultation
filled
paul
this
was
proof
this
was
the
door
opening
for
life
upon
everything
he
ever
hoped
to
gain
everything
he
hoped
to
be
it
gave
him
what
he
wanted
to
offer
life
and
by
happy
circumstance
he
had
found
the
one
he
wanted
to
offer
it
to
he
could
go
to
nora
not
as
a
technician
in
the
bureau
of
astrogation
but
with
a
grand
future
of
success
and
opportunity
to
build
ever
upward
and
ever
onward
to
real
fame
and
fortune
not
the
real
success
in
his
hand
for
when
the
final
success
in
life
comes
ambition
and
desire
begin
to
wane
but
far
more
exhilarating
was
the
hope
of
success
the
chance
to
work
for
a
magnificent
future
together
he
gloated
for
hours
measuring
the
radio
signal
as
few
radio
transmissions
have
ever
been
measured
before
then
with
his
work
finished
paul
packed
up
to
leave
the
glittering
stone
he
held
in
his
hand
was
nice
but
tiny
now
compared
to
his
tale
of
success
a
bright
rock
from
a
planet
not
much
more
than
a
seashell
from
a
distant
beach
with
a
chuckle
he
tossed
the
stone
aside
and
broke
out
the
nora
might
like
a
meteorite
from
far
proxima
i
at
least
it
was
a
souvenir
to
be
quite
in
evidence
wherever
it
might
end
up
he
headed
for
the
meteor
shower
of
three
days
before
and
found
it
after
an
hour
of
running
across
the
featureless
sands
the
area
was
small
which
in
itself
was
strange
for
meteor
showers
cover
miles
of
area
not
square
yards
the
sands
were
pocked
with
small
craters
and
paul
looked
at
them
until
he
found
a
crater
of
medium
size
where
the
rock
was
still
showing
he
hefted
the
stone
from
the
sky
and
carried
it
to
the
on
his
way
back
to
the
little
buggy
he
caught
sight
of
a
glitter
less
than
fifty
feet
away
he
dropped
the
stone
in
the
back
of
the
jeep
and
strode
over
to
see
what
could
be
glittering
this
brightly
in
proxima
veritable
sea
of
bland
yellow
sand
then
he
stood
dumbfounded
for
the
glitter
came
from
the
circular
disc
of
glass
the
eyepiece
of
a
space
suit
which
was
buried
in
the
sand
a
crater
of
irregular
shape
surrounded
it
and
the
meteorite
was
lying
in
view
paul
dropped
into
the
crater
and
lifted
the
stone
to
disclose
a
nauseous
clot
of
brownish
blood
the
remnant
of
space
suit
and
contained
in
it
the
remains
of
a
man
mostly
buried
by
the
impact
the
man
body
stood
almost
upright
the
headpiece
at
ground
level
while
the
rest
of
the
body
was
curved
brokenly
backwards
down
in
the
crater
driven
into
the
sand
instantly
by
the
meteor
paul
shrugged
and
removed
the
helmet
the
face
was
vaguely
familiar
the
man
wore
clothing
under
the
suit
but
there
was
no
sign
of
identification
in
it
the
face
bothered
paul
however
he
believed
he
had
seen
it
somewhere
not
only
that
but
just
exactly
why
any
man
possessed
of
sane
mind
would
be
on
proxima
i
save
paul
who
had
business
there
was
mystery
at
its
best
paul
stood
up
and
looked
around
the
plain
he
caught
another
glitter
and
got
into
his
jeep
to
investigate
it
was
the
spacecraft
and
paul
wondered
at
it
it
was
smashed
flat
by
a
gigantic
meteor
ruined
beyond
any
hope
of
reconstruction
paul
tried
to
enter
to
inspect
it
it
had
been
too
badly
wrecked
by
the
meteor
abandoning
the
spacecraft
as
a
hopeless
job
for
immediate
identification
paul
went
back
to
the
lone
victim
there
was
still
something
vaguely
familiar
about
the
man
face
the
difference
was
not
because
the
vacuum
of
proxima
had
distorted
the
face
for
the
suit
had
been
sealed
at
the
break
by
the
meteor
and
the
sand
and
there
was
no
distortion
paul
pondered
identification
might
be
possible
by
dental
means
by
prints
by
if
the
face
distorted
on
his
way
back
there
was
his
refrigerating
gear
aboard
the
ship
paul
could
stick
the
corpse
in
there
and
hope
that
some
light
could
be
shed
on
this
mystery
paul
folded
the
lower
ruined
portion
of
the
space
suit
to
preserve
whatever
minute
bit
of
air
it
contained
and
packed
it
onto
the
jeep
he
shoved
the
body
into
the
freezing
cold
of
the
storage
bin
with
a
grimace
of
distaste
and
determined
to
dine
on
canned
beans
for
the
duration
it
annoyed
him
to
hurl
several
pounds
of
fine
tenderloin
steak
onto
the
bald
sands
of
proxima
i
to
make
room
for
an
corpse
but
it
had
to
be
done
then
with
the
mystery
still
gnawing
at
his
mind
paul
fixed
the
on
sol
made
a
few
adjustments
and
set
his
autodrive
and
according
to
the
data
supplied
before
his
departure
from
terra
it
was
a
course
the
reverse
of
his
approaching
orbit
paul
clicked
the
drive
and
headed
for
sol
when
the
ship
dropped
into
invisibility
he
relaxed
busy
all
the
time
of
his
stay
on
proxima
i
he
felt
seedy
while
still
pondering
the
problem
paul
shucked
his
clothing
and
showered
water
both
hot
and
then
chilled
did
not
help
his
memory
any
nor
was
it
the
memory
of
nora
phillips
that
made
him
lather
his
face
and
shave
not
entirely
for
the
beard
made
his
face
uncomfortable
and
it
was
personal
comfort
rather
than
white
man
burden
that
prompted
paul
to
reap
his
beard
like
most
men
shaving
was
not
a
pleasant
occupation
and
when
no
matter
of
personal
appearance
insisted
upon
a
smooth
face
shaving
was
postponed
and
indulged
in
only
when
the
factors
of
discomfort
balanced
one
another
equally
and
in
diametrically
opposite
directions
paul
grinned
at
his
clean
face
in
the
mirror
he
said
to
himself
in
the
glass
you
vaguely
familiar
too
the
idea
hit
him
hard
then
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
picture
of
one
self
does
not
resemble
familiar
appearance
in
a
mirror
is
due
to
the
lack
of
facial
symmetry
the
left
side
of
a
mirror
image
is
the
right
side
of
the
face
on
a
photograph
and
the
two
seldom
match
paul
gulped
and
dressed
quickly
then
he
went
to
the
and
hauled
out
the
dead
man
it
would
take
a
third
observer
to
tell
but
so
far
as
paul
grayson
could
tell
this
man
from
proxima
i
was
his
double
and
that
he
said
in
address
to
the
corpse
makes
two
of
you
chapter
ten
days
later
when
paul
ship
dropped
out
of
the
realm
of
invisibility
he
was
no
nearer
to
the
problem
solution
he
did
have
a
course
of
action
formulated
however
so
his
first
telephone
call
was
not
to
nora
phillips
it
was
to
john
stacey
the
detective
i
back
glad
to
hear
it
wha
hoppen
i
got
a
corpse
on
my
ship
friend
of
yours
nope
look
came
the
cheerful
reply
if
you
want
to
murder
someone
go
ahead
but
there
no
sense
in
putting
yourself
in
jeopardy
by
carrying
the
mortal
remains
around
with
you
why
did
you
dump
the
thing
out
in
space
i
want
it
identified
now
for
the
first
time
in
years
you
make
sense
thanks
but
look
said
stacey
suddenly
just
what
kind
of
mess
have
you
gotten
yourself
into
i
do
know
i
hope
to
find
out
well
it
thick
paul
blinked
i
know
it
but
why
you
answer
that
one
it
your
question
what
new
nora
phillips
is
missing
missing
exploded
paul
where
did
she
go
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
yet
what
do
you
know
demanded
paul
damned
little
she
left
you
on
your
departure
day
and
started
to
drive
back
to
town
instead
of
returning
to
her
office
or
going
home
she
turned
off
on
bridge
street
and
stopped
at
a
mansion
number
to
be
exact
drove
her
car
into
the
garage
as
though
she
were
expected
has
come
out
since
you
have
kept
a
man
watching
the
place
for
all
this
time
no
but
i
had
a
gent
prowl
the
joint
at
least
once
a
day
for
the
last
two
weeks
and
the
car
is
still
in
the
garage
you
can
see
it
through
the
windows
of
the
door
did
she
come
out
garage
is
connected
to
the
house
she
could
have
gone
into
the
house
without
breathing
fresh
air
that
bridge
street
check
how
about
her
job
by
careful
enquiry
we
learned
that
she
resigned
by
letter
how
did
you
get
that
well
law
outfits
seldom
take
kindly
to
characters
asking
leading
questions
but
an
advertisement
appeared
for
a
librarian
and
i
had
milly
fill
it
she
pored
through
the
personnel
files
and
found
a
typed
letter
of
resignation
terse
disappointingly
uninformative
her
apartment
she
ran
a
job
alone
a
man
appeared
armed
with
a
letter
from
her
he
packed
up
her
stuff
and
it
was
removed
from
the
premises
by
the
howdaille
moving
and
storage
company
it
is
currently
there
in
storage
with
the
bill
paid
in
advance
for
six
months
any
more
i
had
morton
enquire
about
a
rental
at
that
address
and
he
was
told
that
miss
phillips
had
to
return
home
because
of
illness
of
her
father
that
all
we
could
get
morton
got
that
information
from
the
landlord
after
expressing
first
a
desire
to
live
there
and
second
asking
why
the
previous
tenant
moved
out
put
it
so
that
the
landlord
had
to
show
him
her
letter
to
prevent
a
possible
tenant
from
thinking
that
there
was
something
odious
about
the
premises
then
what
that
all
morton
considered
the
place
apparently
for
several
days
after
putting
down
a
deposit
gave
it
up
and
forfeited
the
deposit
on
the
grounds
that
his
wife
wanted
a
four
room
place
um
gone
without
a
trace
seems
so
excepting
that
she
went
into
bridge
and
we
not
seen
her
since
how
long
did
you
watch
constantly
for
ten
days
not
a
sign
or
a
trace
of
her
there
but
yeah
replied
stacey
unhappy
voice
we
cased
that
joint
too
i
had
at
least
seven
operatives
hit
that
front
door
on
every
sort
of
pretext
from
stolen
nylon
hosiery
to
roofing
salesmen
and
from
governmental
surveys
on
this
and
that
to
gents
who
insist
that
they
look
at
the
electric
wiring
the
plumbing
and
the
foundation
the
joint
is
owned
and
tenanted
by
an
elderly
gentleman
who
has
retired
his
wife
lives
there
too
one
servant
a
doddering
old
fogy
who
must
have
been
the
owner
father
gentleman
gentleman
what
his
name
hoagland
how
about
the
car
in
the
garage
paul
could
almost
hear
stacey
shrug
so
far
there
is
nothing
suspicious
about
it
from
a
legal
standpoint
he
said
you
have
one
hell
of
a
time
proving
anything
so
a
woman
none
too
well
acquainted
with
you
resigns
from
her
position
on
a
perfectly
logical
grounds
moves
from
her
apartment
on
similar
grounds
and
deposits
her
car
in
a
strange
place
and
disappears
but
that
last
is
the
important
thing
she
disappeared
yeah
where
does
her
father
live
maybe
she
did
go
there
you
the
detective
said
paul
chase
it
down
this
will
cost
like
hell
warned
stacey
paul
laughed
what
i
got
will
pay
for
plenty
from
now
on
he
said
i
the
case
then
you
should
have
closed
it
stacey
groaned
how
did
i
know
you
were
that
anxious
i
was
okay
but
i
wanted
your
approval
before
i
broke
this
thing
wide
open
will
it
sure
the
first
time
i
go
to
bridge
and
ask
about
that
automobile
in
the
garage
which
is
registered
under
the
name
of
nora
phillips
someone
is
either
going
to
get
nasty
call
the
police
or
start
asking
me
embarrassing
questions
that
might
lead
to
paul
grayson
stacey
the
guy
i
found
dead
on
proxima
i
is
another
dead
ringer
for
myself
that
makes
two
characters
killed
off
that
resemble
me
it
looks
like
a
plot
to
me
how
was
the
deceased
rendered
that
way
he
was
hit
by
a
meteorite
act
of
god
i
calls
that
muttered
stacey
you
would
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
god
is
on
your
side
when
a
meteorite
hits
a
man
and
a
spacecraft
in
the
same
shower
both
of
which
are
prowling
on
a
planet
where
they
had
no
business
and
should
have
had
any
curiosity
it
begins
to
look
as
though
celestial
mechanics
formerly
run
by
the
act
of
god
might
have
been
given
a
little
aid
and
aim
by
the
machiavellian
hand
of
man
or
men
unknown
how
could
you
aim
a
haul
it
to
the
right
spot
and
drop
it
from
a
good
height
from
a
spacecraft
that
for
the
big
one
that
wrecked
the
ship
carry
a
boatload
of
little
ones
and
drop
on
the
head
of
the
character
you
desire
to
erase
not
one
of
them
penetrated
to
the
depths
i
have
expected
now
that
it
comes
to
mind
okay
paul
i
on
the
trail
again
i
send
a
man
to
collect
your
corpse
and
we
attempt
to
identify
it
maybe
that
will
give
us
a
lead
check
said
paul
and
he
turned
away
from
the
telephone
with
a
heavy
heart
he
recalled
the
lissome
warmth
of
her
body
pressed
eagerly
against
him
could
a
woman
offer
herself
falsely
with
that
much
ardor
paul
clenched
fist
came
down
upon
the
palm
of
his
other
hand
in
a
loud
determined
smack
by
all
that
was
holy
paul
intended
to
find
out
he
answered
his
question
honestly
yes
there
are
women
who
could
play
any
act
do
literally
anything
humanly
possible
to
obtain
their
wants
on
the
other
hand
nora
might
have
run
afoul
of
whatever
interest
it
was
that
apparently
stood
in
his
way
towards
linking
sol
and
neosol
by
had
he
been
uninterested
in
her
as
a
person
he
could
have
shrugged
it
off
with
but
a
minimum
of
hurt
and
wonder
but
paul
made
up
his
mind
to
find
out
about
her
to
take
either
one
of
two
courses
as
far
as
nora
phillips
went
if
nora
were
in
league
with
those
who
stood
against
him
he
wanted
the
dubious
pleasure
of
showing
her
that
she
could
have
been
better
off
by
following
a
more
naturally
honest
plan
and
if
nora
phillips
were
in
trouble
because
she
was
seen
in
company
he
wanted
the
extreme
pleasure
of
belting
the
living
hell
out
of
her
abductors
personally
while
she
watched
and
then
escorting
her
gallantly
to
some
place
where
pain
and
strife
could
be
relegated
to
the
background
to
do
either
paul
must
not
stop
working
towards
his
goal
with
determined
step
paul
headed
for
the
offices
of
the
terran
physical
society
with
his
personal
recorder
upon
which
the
from
the
was
impressed
this
time
it
would
be
grayson
theory
and
it
would
be
presented
to
the
without
the
possibility
of
haedaecker
interference
or
scorn
charles
thorndyke
was
a
man
well
worthy
of
the
scientific
honors
he
owned
unlike
haedaecker
he
did
not
flaunt
them
at
every
hand
he
used
them
only
when
it
was
necessary
and
unlike
chadwick
haedaecker
thorndyke
was
the
kind
of
man
who
would
have
rejected
his
own
pet
theory
instantly
upon
the
first
glimmer
of
proof
that
he
was
in
error
he
listened
to
paul
tale
with
growing
interest
and
then
he
listened
to
the
recording
this
is
a
big
thing
he
told
paul
after
grayson
was
finished
it
is
my
greatest
hope
realized
we
have
a
lengthy
paper
on
gravitational
phenomena
to
be
presented
next
tuesday
i
am
going
to
cancel
that
for
your
presentation
thorndyke
looked
at
the
ceiling
the
chance
of
voice
communication
with
neosol
is
as
great
an
advancement
as
the
discovery
of
the
telegraph
he
said
it
must
not
be
delayed
one
moment
i
always
believed
that
said
paul
why
did
you
speak
up
before
doctor
haedaecker
has
always
vetoed
any
such
suggestion
why
for
the
love
of
heaven
he
said
that
everything
had
been
tried
balderdash
exploded
thorndyke
negative
evidence
is
never
conclusive
i
could
not
argue
with
him
thorndyke
smiled
he
nodded
being
armed
with
a
hope
and
a
firm
belief
is
poor
weapon
against
a
man
as
deeply
entrenched
as
haedaecker
whose
minor
pronouncements
made
news
and
whose
hand
could
write
an
appropriation
for
a
million
dollars
to
pursue
some
experiment
once
this
is
presented
you
will
no
longer
be
a
small
voice
crying
out
in
a
veritable
wilderness
you
will
probably
end
up
with
a
job
to
do
as
big
as
haedaecker
i
ca
understand
him
nor
can
i
you
certain
that
you
presented
your
idea
correctly
so
far
as
i
know
i
been
talking
about
this
thing
for
years
ever
since
i
got
the
idea
thorndyke
laughed
i
know
what
happened
he
said
your
initial
idea
was
but
half
formed
and
therefore
incorrect
but
as
you
improved
upon
it
your
own
arguments
became
trite
to
yourself
and
even
less
convincing
to
haedaecker
who
was
convinced
against
your
idea
have
to
change
his
tune
next
tuesday
paul
left
in
a
fine
state
of
mind
he
was
ahead
of
the
game
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
he
enjoyed
the
feeling
the
question
of
who
or
what
wanted
to
stop
him
was
something
that
he
could
never
find
out
until
the
other
side
made
another
move
as
for
nora
phillips
following
her
trail
was
a
job
for
an
experienced
man
like
stacey
the
third
item
was
haedaecker
paul
did
not
agree
with
thorndyke
haedaecker
was
not
merely
misled
in
this
thing
haedaecker
had
good
reasons
why
he
wanted
the
experiment
hushed
up
haedaecker
theory
had
been
the
making
of
the
man
himself
once
that
theory
was
broken
down
and
shown
incorrect
haedaecker
would
no
longer
be
the
great
mind
that
he
had
been
haedaecker
liked
power
and
adulation
and
naturally
was
disinclined
to
let
it
go
lightly
paul
expected
trouble
with
the
physicist
and
paul
would
have
preferred
to
circumvent
trouble
to
go
around
it
to
avoid
it
but
paul
was
experienced
enough
to
know
that
the
act
of
avoiding
trouble
more
often
made
the
trouble
pile
up
until
it
reached
terrifying
proportions
so
instead
of
staying
strictly
away
from
haedaecker
office
paul
strode
boldly
in
forewarning
the
enemy
of
your
intentions
is
said
to
be
bad
but
now
and
then
telling
the
enemy
what
you
are
going
to
do
and
then
daring
him
to
try
and
stop
you
will
make
him
back
up
because
it
tends
to
convince
him
that
you
are
equipped
to
do
as
you
want
to
do
regardless
of
opposition
chadwick
haedaecker
greeted
paul
cordially
everything
go
all
right
he
asked
paul
nodded
the
reports
on
the
radio
signal
have
been
turned
in
complete
with
recordings
and
my
own
comments
good
haedaecker
turned
to
a
map
on
the
wall
he
consulted
a
list
beside
the
map
then
he
turned
with
a
smile
that
was
the
first
he
said
the
next
signal
does
come
in
for
almost
six
months
then
my
young
friend
you
will
be
the
busiest
man
in
space
for
the
next
two
years
hopping
hither
and
thither
to
check
in
the
network
i
glad
that
everything
went
as
expected
everything
did
good
this
first
one
was
the
one
that
proves
we
right
now
that
we
got
one
checked
in
we
can
take
the
rest
with
less
wonder
and
concern
haedaecker
looked
at
paul
sharply
but
this
is
all
you
came
to
tell
me
about
no
said
paul
quietly
it
is
not
doctor
haedaecker
i
am
not
one
to
fly
a
false
flag
i
dislike
the
idea
of
thrusting
a
man
ideas
back
down
his
throat
abruptly
and
in
public
just
what
are
you
driving
at
demanded
haedaecker
upon
proxima
centauri
i
i
definitely
proved
the
error
of
theory
i
received
a
ridiculous
i
did
stated
paul
flatly
and
so
i
am
telling
you
because
i
feel
that
you
should
have
some
opportunity
to
protect
yourself
i
need
no
protection
you
have
always
defended
your
theory
viciously
you
have
never
permitted
the
merest
possibility
that
you
could
be
wrong
i
have
proof
now
impossible
i
have
said
paul
and
i
intend
to
show
it
so
if
you
care
to
make
any
statements
which
will
change
your
previous
attitude
do
so
haedaecker
looked
at
paul
queerly
just
what
would
you
recommend
he
asked
paul
smiled
if
i
were
you
he
said
i
would
accept
the
defeat
of
your
theory
graciously
indeed
paul
made
an
exasperated
noise
i
only
trying
to
save
your
embarrassment
you
insolent
young
puppy
you
trying
to
help
me
paul
took
a
deep
breath
this
was
not
going
well
at
all
but
on
the
other
hand
paul
knew
that
he
was
no
longer
a
small
voice
to
be
throttled
by
the
mere
gesture
from
haedaecker
paul
was
in
full
control
of
the
situation
whether
haedaecker
realized
it
or
not
furthermore
the
awe
of
haedaecker
and
his
rule
had
not
left
their
ineradicable
mark
unlike
the
child
ruled
by
stern
parents
who
defers
to
their
orders
long
after
maturity
because
of
habit
former
deference
was
gone
perhaps
the
only
difference
was
that
parents
seldom
lose
their
command
of
respect
because
the
maturing
offspring
learns
as
the
years
go
past
that
their
seemingly
arbitrary
rules
were
actually
born
of
wisdom
that
the
child
could
not
understand
whereas
haedaecker
was
a
god
with
feet
of
clay
when
the
mighty
fall
they
fall
far
and
hard
i
was
trying
to
save
you
embarrassment
snapped
paul
once
the
truth
is
known
that
you
refused
to
permit
any
experiment
because
it
might
shake
the
foundations
of
haedaecker
theory
your
entire
policy
will
be
destroyed
so
what
would
you
have
me
do
why
not
sponsor
this
idea
suggested
paul
be
the
first
to
proclaim
happily
that
haedaecker
theory
was
in
error
and
that
you
now
join
in
the
hope
of
connecting
sol
and
neosol
by
real
communications
haedaecker
shook
his
head
coldly
i
sponsor
no
such
ridiculous
thing
he
said
because
it
can
not
be
you
but
i
have
proof
haedaecker
stood
up
you
have
not
i
have
thundered
paul
and
i
intend
to
show
it
haedaecker
sat
down
again
and
placed
the
fingertips
of
each
hand
against
the
other
making
a
sort
of
cage
now
i
warn
you
he
told
paul
your
proof
is
false
whatever
it
is
and
if
you
should
make
the
mistake
of
making
a
public
spectacle
of
your
efforts
to
disparage
a
law
of
physics
i
shall
take
measures
to
ensure
that
you
never
make
such
an
idiotic
error
again
why
do
you
fire
me
taunted
paul
as
soon
as
you
publicly
violate
my
rules
i
shall
then
come
to
the
next
tuesday
snapped
paul
and
watch
me
break
both
your
rules
and
your
theory
with
one
fell
swoop
haedaecker
shrugged
i
be
there
to
watch
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself
he
said
paul
turned
on
one
heel
and
left
chapter
stacey
voice
was
as
dry
as
ever
busy
paul
just
polishing
up
my
talk
he
said
i
due
to
lecture
in
an
hour
well
do
be
nervous
i
be
less
nervous
if
i
knew
what
was
going
on
this
might
help
first
your
corpse
was
none
other
than
a
loser
named
clarke
and
a
pot
full
of
aliases
none
of
which
are
worth
mentioning
as
dead
as
a
mackerel
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
him
it
been
done
how
do
ask
but
is
this
disposing
evidence
sure
but
if
any
crime
has
been
committed
he
did
it
or
attempted
to
he
is
no
loss
to
the
community
but
that
is
against
the
law
so
is
kissing
a
woman
who
is
of
no
relation
to
you
in
public
in
this
state
chuckled
stacey
you
only
get
involved
in
a
lot
of
official
curiosity
if
you
disclose
the
death
that
will
get
you
a
grilling
and
a
mess
of
suspicion
to
fight
against
while
the
birds
who
set
him
on
you
will
be
forewarned
they
be
free
to
plot
further
while
you
are
busy
defending
an
innocent
stand
besides
he
added
with
another
chuckle
there
is
nothing
like
making
them
chew
a
fingernail
wondering
just
where
their
plans
went
afoul
let
them
scurry
around
instead
of
you
if
i
guess
right
they
are
not
quite
certain
whether
the
man
now
talking
to
me
is
paul
grayson
bona
fide
or
their
little
masquerader
but
why
for
the
love
of
heaven
look
mes
infante
innocente
this
is
twice
that
you
met
a
character
made
up
to
resemble
you
this
means
an
intended
masquerade
i
know
why
but
i
bet
a
hat
that
there
is
a
motive
to
it
all
the
last
was
so
obvious
that
paul
saw
no
reason
to
comment
stacey
continued
one
more
item
before
i
go
away
and
leave
you
to
your
test
tubes
nora
phillips
yes
came
paul
eager
reply
posing
as
a
man
making
a
survey
i
me
myself
twiggled
on
the
doorbell
at
bridge
avenue
this
afternoon
after
canvassing
the
entire
neighborhood
up
to
that
point
to
make
it
look
good
go
on
nora
phillips
is
their
niece
the
elderly
gentleman
said
so
she
parked
her
car
there
for
the
time
being
since
her
pappy
brother
to
his
wife
is
desperately
ill
on
neosol
so
she
be
back
but
they
did
not
know
when
get
her
address
could
get
too
curious
no
damn
why
somehow
nora
is
tied
up
in
this
on
my
side
okay
i
going
to
follow
one
other
lead
take
it
easy
paul
and
give
the
physicists
hell
i
try
i
will
begin
at
the
beginning
smiled
paul
wishing
he
had
the
air
of
a
professional
lecturer
and
the
literary
ability
of
an
author
space
was
first
conquered
by
rocket
propulsion
eventually
a
base
was
established
on
luna
and
the
space
stations
set
up
operating
in
space
the
physicists
discovered
the
supervelocity
drive
which
like
electricity
was
used
long
before
people
began
to
understand
it
the
rocket
is
a
clumsy
device
and
to
anything
but
limited
professional
use
but
the
superdrive
made
space
travel
practical
for
the
ordinary
man
space
was
truly
conquered
then
and
today
men
live
on
venus
and
on
mars
precariously
and
uncomfortably
but
they
live
there
men
have
spread
throughout
the
solar
system
working
in
mines
and
medicinal
farms
and
jungles
their
tenure
of
employment
is
dictated
by
the
rigors
of
life
on
these
inimical
planets
of
sol
with
the
superdrive
explorers
chased
through
the
nearer
galaxy
seeking
a
planet
suitable
for
colonization
while
most
stars
have
been
found
to
have
planets
there
was
not
one
found
that
filled
the
bill
until
they
located
neosol
and
neoterra
both
of
which
resemble
sol
and
the
earth
to
a
fine
degree
radio
linked
the
colonies
of
sol
and
after
neosol
was
colonized
radio
linked
its
colonists
forty
years
ago
carrington
discovered
the
an
outgrowth
of
the
superdrive
then
the
instantaneous
replaced
the
slow
radio
transmissions
that
required
teletype
and
code
communications
and
voice
to
voice
contacts
prevailed
throughout
the
solar
system
and
throughout
the
system
of
neosol
but
the
did
not
cross
the
gulf
of
interstellar
space
and
years
of
experimentation
followed
all
of
which
failed
then
twenty
years
ago
chadwick
haedaecker
suggested
the
theory
now
known
as
theory
which
tended
to
show
that
the
propagated
because
of
the
fields
of
force
generated
in
the
central
cores
of
stars
since
that
date
only
desultory
attempts
have
been
made
to
test
the
in
deep
space
experimentation
had
stopped
for
all
practical
purposes
about
the
only
people
who
have
given
the
matter
much
thought
are
students
of
theory
and
a
couple
of
hardy
souls
like
myself
who
i
have
been
accused
and
of
which
i
must
admit
hoped
to
become
rich
and
famous
by
making
some
extraordinary
discovery
i
will
now
advance
the
idea
that
i
hope
will
be
eventually
known
as
grayson
principle
the
basis
of
grayson
principle
is
that
the
will
not
propagate
between
points
that
have
not
previously
been
linked
by
electromagnetic
waves
this
caused
a
storm
in
the
auditorium
a
showing
of
frantic
hands
flowered
above
the
sea
of
faces
and
the
hall
broke
into
a
growling
murmur
of
muttering
voices
discussing
pro
and
con
the
chairman
came
forward
and
spoke
to
paul
shall
i
call
order
or
would
you
prefer
to
have
a
discussion
paul
smiled
nervously
i
was
prepared
for
this
he
said
the
rest
of
this
will
run
better
if
we
get
this
one
point
settled
it
will
be
too
long
from
now
to
the
end
of
my
lecture
to
make
these
men
hold
their
questions
good
smiled
thorndyke
he
rapped
for
order
gentlemen
he
said
speaking
over
the
incomplete
attention
mister
grayson
has
just
made
a
rather
shocking
statement
which
is
cause
for
controversy
he
has
suggested
himself
that
a
period
of
questions
will
hasten
our
understanding
of
his
theory
there
was
a
burst
of
applause
and
the
flowering
of
hands
went
up
again
edwin
johnson
said
the
first
man
naming
himself
granting
that
it
takes
light
one
hundred
and
forty
years
to
cross
between
here
and
neosol
i
suggest
that
the
entire
galaxy
has
been
coupled
by
electromagnetic
waves
for
two
thousand
million
years
i
said
explained
paul
easily
this
question
is
one
that
stumped
me
for
a
long
time
and
was
possibly
the
one
thing
that
prevented
the
advancement
of
the
principle
long
before
but
the
detectors
we
employ
to
detect
those
frequencies
we
term
are
not
similar
to
those
we
use
for
the
longer
frequencies
of
radio
even
though
both
are
electromagnetic
waves
light
will
not
travel
along
a
conductor
although
it
is
true
that
the
longer
waves
will
be
transmitted
through
a
waveguide
made
of
dielectric
that
is
transparent
to
them
ergo
it
is
the
means
we
use
to
handle
these
frequencies
that
establish
the
rather
than
the
medium
or
the
wave
itself
i
am
fred
hughes
said
the
second
do
you
mean
to
state
that
the
has
never
been
known
to
operate
between
points
not
previously
linked
by
radio
that
is
right
you
investigated
everything
mine
is
negative
evidence
i
admit
this
is
why
it
is
hard
to
establish
as
truth
but
remember
the
solar
system
was
linked
by
radio
long
before
the
was
discovered
how
about
spacecraft
once
the
linkage
is
established
by
its
forerunner
of
radio
it
is
complete
and
can
not
be
broken
a
spacecraft
employs
radio
until
it
reaches
the
superdrive
point
then
i
have
had
no
opportunity
to
check
this
point
as
yet
i
believe
it
has
to
do
with
the
doppler
effect
remember
that
the
selectivity
of
the
radio
used
in
space
is
such
that
a
doppler
shift
will
not
detune
it
grossly
obviously
superdrive
will
completely
ruin
such
tuning
but
this
has
been
tried
yes
it
was
once
hoped
that
we
could
link
to
neosol
that
way
the
connection
failed
as
soon
as
the
ship
entered
superdrive
but
interplanetary
ships
employ
i
have
had
no
opportunity
to
check
this
on
an
interstellar
scale
i
shall
at
the
earliest
opportunity
it
is
my
belief
that
the
radio
beacons
between
earth
and
venus
for
instance
are
maintained
at
both
ends
by
receiver
and
transmitter
the
receiver
being
used
to
control
the
transmitter
and
keep
the
beam
properly
centered
and
to
check
its
presence
this
contact
made
in
both
directions
along
the
spacelanes
maintains
the
operation
of
the
on
the
ship
running
at
higher
than
the
speed
of
light
the
radio
is
of
course
useless
but
the
propagating
at
some
figure
we
can
not
measure
yet
suffers
no
doppler
effect
i
am
grant
lewdan
said
the
third
has
the
ever
been
tried
in
the
depths
of
interstellar
space
yes
did
it
work
up
to
a
certain
point
then
why
did
they
pursue
it
this
answer
demands
that
we
all
understand
the
psychology
of
the
human
being
and
the
mechanics
of
the
scientific
method
i
will
answer
this
first
by
analog
presume
for
the
moment
that
radio
can
not
propagate
across
a
space
that
communication
has
not
crossed
previously
then
consider
marconi
on
his
first
attempt
to
send
radio
waves
across
a
hundred
feet
of
vacant
lot
what
is
the
method
used
in
testing
an
unknown
method
of
communication
the
transmitter
is
started
and
the
operator
either
calls
or
signals
by
waving
his
hands
that
the
transmitter
is
now
working
as
soon
as
the
hand
signal
is
seen
the
receiver
is
checked
found
to
be
working
remember
this
radio
works
because
of
the
previous
linkage
by
communication
in
accordance
with
our
hypothesis
success
is
noted
then
the
distance
is
increased
by
many
miles
from
mountain
top
to
mountain
top
and
a
blinker
system
is
employed
to
carry
the
experimental
information
back
and
forth
again
the
transmitter
is
started
and
the
blinker
used
to
inform
the
other
party
that
he
is
to
watch
for
the
radio
response
again
it
works
since
communications
have
been
established
for
the
third
time
the
radio
equipment
is
separated
by
the
antipodes
of
the
earth
and
a
telephone
or
telegraph
connection
is
established
again
the
transmitter
is
started
and
the
signal
is
sent
again
there
is
success
now
gentlemen
the
inference
is
that
radio
will
work
to
a
distance
encompassing
the
entire
earth
now
postulate
a
spacecraft
taking
this
same
equipment
to
the
moon
lacking
radio
no
means
of
communication
are
practical
let
us
say
venus
instead
gentlemen
since
a
magnesium
flare
might
be
used
from
luna
so
on
venus
there
is
no
means
of
communication
other
than
radio
which
depends
first
upon
the
establishment
of
other
means
of
communication
ere
it
will
work
a
failure
is
noted
now
smiled
paul
this
is
what
happened
in
deep
space
i
would
like
to
read
an
excerpt
from
the
communications
expedition
number
three
two
spacecraft
were
dispatched
from
pluto
and
proceeded
outward
for
approximately
one
light
hour
as
established
by
the
timing
wave
from
pluto
the
was
tested
and
found
available
here
follows
a
couple
of
columns
of
figures
regarding
signal
strength
and
so
on
at
one
hundred
light
hours
the
same
test
was
made
and
found
successful
at
this
point
gentlemen
remember
that
they
used
the
timing
wave
from
pluto
to
establish
their
distance
which
established
radio
communications
now
remember
the
techniques
employed
in
such
tactics
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
spacecraft
to
wait
a
hundred
hours
for
the
arrival
of
the
wave
the
wave
is
sent
forth
a
hundred
hours
before
the
ship
gets
there
so
that
no
waiting
time
will
be
necessary
in
fact
they
tried
it
at
one
thousand
light
hours
since
that
was
the
distance
previously
established
by
the
timing
wave
from
pluto
again
it
worked
successfully
the
timing
wave
had
been
started
about
twelve
hundred
hours
before
and
as
usual
it
was
that
at
any
point
along
the
line
the
ship
could
stop
listen
in
and
mark
the
time
it
was
sort
of
like
a
rope
with
a
series
of
knots
in
it
having
made
this
approximation
the
ships
went
into
deep
space
about
three
light
years
distant
from
sol
where
they
were
not
closer
than
three
light
years
from
any
star
at
this
distance
the
radio
signal
from
pluto
had
not
arrived
and
they
had
no
idea
of
waiting
for
three
years
for
it
since
they
did
not
conceive
of
grayson
principle
but
they
communicated
with
one
another
one
light
hour
waiting
for
the
timing
wave
and
it
was
shown
successful
i
read
again
ten
light
hours
there
was
no
success
our
technical
officer
then
spent
many
hours
checking
his
equipment
while
the
navigating
officer
used
the
scooter
to
run
back
and
forth
with
spacecraft
burast
to
ascertain
whether
the
gear
was
in
operation
the
arrival
of
the
timing
wave
distracted
his
attention
for
a
period
of
about
five
minutes
during
which
he
established
the
separation
between
the
two
ships
upon
returning
to
the
equipment
and
completing
his
many
investigations
as
to
sensitivity
and
function
he
was
satisfied
that
it
was
in
operating
shape
at
this
point
it
was
tried
again
and
twenty
minutes
of
conversation
ensued
proving
that
the
was
operative
at
a
distance
of
at
least
one
hundred
and
seven
point
three
eight
light
hours
as
established
by
the
timing
wave
second
technical
sergeant
frankford
brown
was
reprimanded
for
removing
the
gear
from
the
rack
and
panel
and
placing
it
on
the
and
thus
wasting
many
hours
equipment
was
again
tried
at
one
thousand
light
hours
but
no
success
was
found
even
though
ten
or
twelve
hours
ensued
during
the
listening
test
because
our
supplies
were
now
running
low
the
test
was
abandoned
at
this
distance
and
here
gentlemen
follows
an
account
of
at
least
a
hundred
hours
of
testing
constantly
with
the
two
ships
at
varying
distances
success
came
sometimes
complete
failure
at
others
there
is
a
complete
set
of
spacial
maps
but
these
show
no
contours
of
signal
strength
nor
correlation
only
a
man
who
believed
that
the
followed
radio
communications
would
establish
such
a
correlation
and
how
was
this
correlation
located
asked
lewdan
because
i
noted
that
when
failure
came
it
was
noted
at
distances
ten
light
hours
fifteen
light
hours
three
light
hours
but
when
success
came
it
came
at
point
or
fourteen
point
light
hours
in
other
words
gentlemen
they
knew
their
separation
only
when
success
came
and
they
could
measure
the
distance
accurately
by
the
radio
timing
wave
during
this
time
the
hands
were
dropping
as
the
answer
to
one
question
answered
the
questions
of
others
at
the
end
there
were
no
more
hands
upraised
thorndyke
then
said
we
are
now
ready
to
continue
with
this
lecture
paul
took
a
gulp
of
water
and
started
off
again
i
have
one
other
item
to
bring
forth
i
have
been
working
with
the
galactic
survey
and
paul
went
on
for
many
minutes
explaining
in
detail
what
they
had
been
doing
and
why
he
finished
up
with
his
determination
to
test
the
in
accordance
with
his
own
theory
then
he
said
i
have
here
a
recording
made
over
the
receiver
i
took
with
me
to
proxima
centauri
i
as
you
know
the
interstellar
beacon
was
erected
on
the
top
of
the
central
building
no
visual
connection
seems
necessary
but
we
all
know
that
dielectric
or
permeabilic
coupling
serves
in
many
places
far
better
than
a
conducting
link
it
is
my
idea
that
similar
factors
to
permeability
and
capacity
will
be
found
in
the
however
central
is
supplied
from
power
line
here
is
a
physical
connection
upon
my
arrival
at
the
proxima
station
this
recorder
was
started
with
the
radio
you
will
hear
in
the
recording
which
was
made
through
a
microphone
to
pick
up
the
as
well
as
the
broadcast
the
arrival
of
the
radio
signal
from
terra
the
timing
signals
a
few
of
my
own
comments
made
i
must
admit
in
the
stress
of
enthusiasm
and
finally
the
terran
side
of
an
interplanetary
conversation
between
a
woman
and
her
man
while
i
deplore
any
public
airing
of
the
personal
affairs
of
any
man
and
woman
this
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
civilization
while
the
subject
of
her
conversation
is
such
that
she
can
have
only
pride
in
having
it
made
into
history
for
he
added
softly
hers
is
the
voice
of
true
honest
affection
faith
and
trust
in
her
mate
and
such
is
well
worthy
of
a
monument
in
the
halls
of
history
there
was
a
round
of
applause
at
this
moment
and
then
the
recording
rang
out
but
it
wo
be
long
my
dear
of
course
it
seems
so
do
that
by
all
means
in
a
month
you
say
i
very
happy
about
that
the
signal
faded
and
in
the
background
the
audience
could
hear
the
measured
cadence
of
the
radio
timing
signals
with
a
few
of
paul
own
personal
comments
of
exultation
then
the
signal
came
in
again
terry
said
so
how
do
i
know
by
all
means
my
dear
paul
turned
the
recording
off
amid
the
thunderous
roar
of
applause
chapter
with
a
smile
of
paul
faced
the
cheering
auditorium
and
gloried
in
the
praise
it
this
moment
was
payment
in
plenty
for
years
of
struggle
and
of
being
a
voice
crying
against
the
stone
wall
of
authority
he
took
their
cries
of
praise
with
a
deferent
attitude
but
remained
on
the
podium
which
indicated
that
he
had
more
to
tell
they
subsided
after
minutes
of
wild
applause
and
paul
continued
across
the
galaxy
between
here
and
neosol
he
said
waving
a
hand
which
caused
a
wall
curtain
to
rise
showing
a
planar
map
of
the
star
region
between
the
two
inhabited
systems
with
red
and
blue
lines
the
galactic
survey
has
a
veritable
network
of
radio
beacon
signals
from
star
to
star
they
go
directly
and
in
cross
triangulation
in
collateral
paths
and
in
long
sweeps
the
red
lines
show
what
distance
these
radio
signals
have
progressed
as
of
three
days
ago
the
length
of
the
continuing
blue
lines
show
the
distance
between
the
stars
yet
to
travel
ere
contact
is
made
such
is
the
separation
of
stars
in
our
galaxy
that
the
next
three
years
will
see
greater
numbers
of
final
contacts
made
i
shall
be
a
busy
man
for
i
will
be
making
these
final
contacts
one
by
one
until
the
entire
pathway
tortuous
as
it
will
be
at
first
is
open
to
neosol
gentlemen
they
drove
the
golden
spike
in
coupling
east
and
west
by
railroad
three
years
two
hours
and
minutes
from
this
very
instant
we
shall
drive
the
golden
key
home
in
the
link
between
mother
earth
and
her
distant
daughter
neoterra
again
came
the
thunder
of
applause
thank
you
said
paul
are
there
any
more
questions
one
called
a
voice
from
the
rear
yes
this
recording
of
the
was
made
from
central
yes
just
for
the
purpose
of
circumventing
any
such
odium
of
doubt
is
there
any
method
by
which
you
can
definitely
determine
the
time
of
origin
of
this
recorded
transmission
not
at
the
present
it
can
be
established
by
the
radio
beacon
records
that
i
was
on
proxima
i
at
that
time
what
i
hope
to
do
is
to
have
the
unknown
woman
come
forward
and
identify
herself
and
the
time
she
used
the
then
other
than
that
there
is
no
way
of
proving
that
this
recording
might
have
been
made
on
terra
a
month
before
you
left
i
but
thorndyke
interrupted
gentlemen
he
said
no
man
in
his
right
mind
would
attempt
a
fraud
upon
this
body
i
have
no
doubt
i
firmly
believe
that
paul
grayson
has
presented
evidence
that
he
has
collected
in
true
scientific
honesty
this
brought
another
round
of
cheering
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
questioner
came
walking
down
the
aisle
toward
the
platform
out
of
the
shadows
he
came
and
paul
tensed
for
the
imminent
battle
of
wits
for
the
questioner
was
none
other
than
chadwick
haedaecker
where
did
you
get
that
recording
he
shouted
over
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
on
proxima
on
the
yes
doctor
thorndyke
may
i
have
the
stage
for
a
moment
thorndyke
nodded
wondering
what
this
was
all
about
paul
stepped
aside
as
haedaecker
took
the
podium
gentlemen
said
haedaecker
for
some
number
of
months
my
young
friend
here
has
been
avidly
attempting
to
force
me
into
trying
experiments
made
years
before
he
has
a
personal
ingrained
belief
that
haedaecker
theory
is
at
fault
you
have
heard
his
alleged
recording
alleged
stormed
paul
haedaecker
held
up
a
hand
then
he
pointed
out
to
the
audience
doctor
haddon
could
this
message
have
passed
through
the
central
a
hush
fell
on
the
auditorium
haddon
rose
and
cleared
his
throat
according
to
my
records
central
was
inoperative
for
a
fourteen
day
period
immediately
following
paul
grayson
departure
for
proxima
centauri
i
certain
repairs
were
needed
and
the
equipment
was
shut
down
for
that
period
all
messages
terminating
on
terra
were
shunted
through
the
auxiliary
tandem
station
at
oahu
hawaii
the
proxima
beam
was
shut
down
too
since
the
radio
signal
emanating
from
it
would
not
reach
proxima
for
four
years
and
that
which
paul
grayson
was
to
measure
had
been
emitted
four
years
ago
it
was
not
deemed
reasonable
to
maintain
the
beam
paul
gulped
this
is
preposterous
he
roared
haedaecker
merely
smiled
so
is
the
truth
he
said
sourly
thorndyke
said
then
doctor
haedaecker
it
is
patently
impossible
for
the
energy
relation
to
have
caused
the
transmission
of
the
such
as
paul
grayson
suggests
impossible
thorndyke
faced
paul
then
why
was
this
farce
perpetrated
this
was
no
farce
paul
almost
shouted
haedaecker
has
always
discouraged
anything
at
all
that
would
cause
him
to
retract
his
own
precious
theory
he
will
lie
cheat
and
steal
thorndyke
turned
to
haedaecker
can
this
be
true
haedaecker
smiled
genially
grayson
is
young
and
dreamily
hopeful
he
said
blandly
grayson
has
all
of
the
hope
and
faith
for
mankind
that
a
saviour
a
saint
or
a
complete
idiot
might
have
he
believes
firmly
that
if
enough
people
want
something
to
obtain
by
sheer
effort
and
determination
they
can
make
it
so
but
why
was
this
done
grayson
hoped
to
stir
up
enough
hope
to
have
a
research
group
assigned
to
crack
this
impossible
problem
it
is
not
impossible
now
paul
was
shouting
haedaecker
shook
his
head
you
have
no
evidence
whatever
you
are
now
where
you
have
always
been
you
base
your
argument
on
a
hope
and
a
prayer
but
have
nothing
concrete
to
show
for
it
haedaecker
faced
the
auditorium
with
a
raised
hand
i
am
a
physicist
he
thundered
and
i
have
been
reviled
by
my
former
employee
grayson
for
attempting
to
suppress
any
ideas
that
would
show
haedaecker
theory
might
be
in
error
this
is
a
cruel
attack
unwarranted
and
unkind
like
my
fellows
i
firmly
believe
that
theory
always
must
be
bent
to
follow
fact
that
when
any
theory
is
confronted
by
experimental
evidence
to
the
contrary
it
is
the
theory
that
must
be
changed
because
the
fact
remains
indisputable
let
but
one
man
show
me
the
error
in
theory
and
it
will
be
relegated
to
the
discard
by
no
one
quicker
than
haedaecker
myself
god
knows
gentlemen
i
despair
of
offering
a
theory
that
stands
against
the
innermost
wishes
of
mankind
thorndyke
turned
to
grayson
where
did
this
recording
come
from
i
made
it
on
proxima
possibly
said
haedaecker
scathingly
but
by
what
method
it
was
made
honestly
shouted
paul
honestly
sneered
haedaecker
with
both
central
off
the
air
and
the
radio
beacon
inoperative
both
important
factors
in
your
pet
idea
were
not
running
at
the
time
you
claim
that
this
recording
was
made
paul
shook
his
head
angrily
if
the
central
and
the
beacon
were
turned
off
he
stormed
bitterly
then
how
did
i
receive
this
on
my
receiver
haedaecker
voice
was
wholly
scornful
a
script
he
said
written
and
acted
by
an
accomplished
actress
recorded
by
grayson
doubtless
mister
grayson
your
plea
that
this
unknown
woman
on
your
record
come
forward
for
honor
and
identification
might
be
accomplished
which
of
your
many
girl
friends
did
this
snapped
haedaecker
with
his
sudden
verbal
attack
no
one
paul
stopped
as
the
familiar
voice
on
his
recording
went
through
his
brain
as
it
had
so
often
since
he
heard
it
on
proxima
i
but
it
wo
be
long
my
dear
of
course
it
seems
so
do
that
by
all
means
and
as
the
voice
seemed
to
speak
aloud
paul
recalled
another
voice
the
voice
of
a
most
attractive
woman
replying
to
his
suggestion
that
he
call
her
that
by
all
then
paul
knew
not
only
the
voice
but
the
mannerism
that
not
truly
a
command
but
far
more
than
mere
acquiescence
that
was
nora
phillips
way
her
voice
her
mannerism
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
paul
grayson
forehead
two
men
had
died
because
of
this
why
true
both
were
criminals
but
what
possible
attraction
could
paul
grand
dream
of
interstellar
communications
have
for
a
thief
a
felon
and
a
murderer
two
men
had
died
and
then
as
haedaecker
technicians
cut
off
the
sources
of
signals
from
central
nora
phillips
had
come
forward
to
supply
paul
with
the
necessary
evidence
to
success
why
certainly
she
could
not
hope
that
his
unsupported
story
would
stand
up
against
the
certain
statement
that
central
was
down
and
out
besides
there
was
not
time
for
a
spacecraft
to
get
to
proxima
i
between
the
time
that
central
went
off
the
air
and
the
time
that
paul
recorded
the
signal
had
nora
phillips
been
on
proxima
someone
had
someone
had
been
there
lying
in
wait
for
paul
grayson
for
what
inexplicable
reason
paul
could
not
begin
to
name
and
someone
else
had
been
there
too
lying
in
wait
for
the
interference
someone
had
irrevocably
removed
the
criminal
lying
in
wait
for
paul
and
then
had
blithely
furnished
paul
with
the
signal
he
had
been
waiting
four
long
years
to
hear
the
answer
was
hidden
behind
the
heavy
mahogany
door
at
bridge
street
despite
the
placid
appearance
of
a
man
retired
from
business
his
elderly
wife
and
doddering
manservant
for
nora
phillips
had
disappeared
behind
that
door
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
young
man
demanded
thorndyke
paul
blinked
at
the
chairman
he
was
completely
stunned
absolutely
beaten
shocked
to
the
core
he
shook
his
head
i
swear
he
began
he
was
interrupted
by
the
shout
of
fraud
from
the
rear
of
the
auditorium
instantly
the
place
was
in
a
violent
uproar
those
who
had
applauded
the
loudest
were
now
shouting
for
paul
head
fraud
throw
him
out
liar
the
stairways
at
either
end
of
the
stage
filled
with
hoarsely
shouting
men
who
came
up
slowly
but
with
determined
step
gaining
confidence
as
they
advanced
throw
him
out
screamed
a
voice
out
away
thorndyke
hammered
on
the
pulpit
with
his
gavel
he
might
as
well
have
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
hurricane
the
rap
of
authority
was
lost
in
the
disorderly
cry
of
an
angry
mob
men
of
learning
wisdom
education
their
civilized
veneer
hurled
away
by
disappointment
anger
and
the
smell
of
fraud
came
forward
with
animal
hatred
intellectually
naked
paul
looked
wildly
around
the
stage
as
the
foremost
of
the
mob
came
to
the
top
of
the
steps
this
was
the
time
for
escape
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
honest
or
the
fraud
and
liar
they
called
him
no
time
for
argument
only
flight
he
faded
back
against
the
curtain
they
came
forward
at
him
warily
awaiting
some
move
of
his
had
paul
moved
fast
they
would
have
leaped
like
predators
so
long
as
he
oozed
back
with
no
overt
move
they
prowled
instead
of
jumping
perhaps
the
only
remaining
vestige
of
their
lifetime
of
training
was
their
desire
to
wait
until
he
struck
at
them
first
that
they
wanted
paul
to
strike
the
blow
that
would
invite
them
to
strike
back
this
was
a
mob
lynching
mad
paul
looked
over
their
heads
to
the
fire
exit
it
was
the
only
avenue
of
escape
but
blocked
by
twenty
madmen
he
pressed
back
against
the
curtain
wondering
if
he
would
get
out
of
this
alive
then
the
howling
died
like
the
turning
off
of
an
overloaded
sound
amplifier
for
out
between
the
curtains
stepped
a
burly
policeman
his
nightstick
was
firm
in
his
right
hand
the
thong
wrapped
tight
around
his
wrist
the
business
end
of
the
heavy
stick
rested
in
his
left
palm
his
revolver
hung
in
the
holster
its
safety
strap
unsnapped
he
was
the
very
essence
of
authority
big
uniformed
immobile
the
advance
upon
paul
stopped
paul
breathed
a
prayer
of
thanks
you
paul
grayson
he
asked
i
am
the
policeman
voice
was
flat
hard
and
dry
did
you
know
there
was
a
dead
man
aboard
your
spacecraft
paul
blanched
stacey
had
said
paul
grayson
i
arrest
you
for
implications
in
the
murder
of
john
stacey
better
come
quietly
and
remember
that
anything
you
say
may
be
used
as
evidence
against
you
stacey
the
world
took
a
quick
spin
about
paul
head
stacey
there
was
sudden
motion
and
the
quick
lashed
snap
of
handcuffs
while
paul
tired
mind
was
still
racing
in
the
of
complete
disbelief
he
went
woodenly
with
the
policeman
behind
him
he
heard
haedaecker
say
and
now
it
is
murder
to
boot
chapter
there
is
something
about
a
pair
of
handcuffs
far
above
and
beyond
the
mere
chaining
of
wrist
to
wrist
mobility
is
not
decreased
and
the
flailing
of
hands
against
an
enemy
is
not
greatly
impaired
but
the
idea
of
being
manacled
presents
a
condition
in
psychology
of
complete
defeat
in
completely
bewildered
defeat
paul
grayson
looked
down
at
the
chromium
handcuffs
with
an
air
of
blankness
john
stacey
nora
phillips
the
policeman
led
paul
grayson
from
the
hall
amid
a
complete
quietness
only
when
they
were
beyond
the
curtain
and
heading
towards
the
stage
door
did
the
buzz
of
outraged
conversation
start
almost
covering
the
pounding
of
thorndyke
gavel
then
the
outer
door
closed
behind
them
and
the
noise
was
cut
off
something
in
paul
inner
mind
felt
grateful
that
the
car
awaiting
was
a
standard
model
of
police
car
instead
of
the
traditional
patrol
wagon
there
is
something
even
more
damning
in
being
carted
away
in
the
the
completely
stunning
abruptness
the
positive
cliff
of
success
from
which
he
had
fallen
into
the
chasm
of
absolute
futility
shocked
paul
into
a
feeling
of
unreality
he
felt
like
an
outsider
watching
a
complete
stranger
being
led
in
docility
towards
a
police
car
by
a
uniformed
policeman
obviously
the
perpetrator
of
some
outrageous
illegal
immoral
unethical
act
he
could
not
identify
this
illicit
individual
with
himself
it
was
a
horrible
dream
and
in
this
dreamlike
state
paul
took
note
of
a
series
of
completely
which
his
mind
recorded
in
minute
detail
he
noted
a
woman
in
an
outlandish
hat
a
man
in
tuxedo
with
a
wrinkle
across
the
facade
of
his
boiled
shirt
the
sidewalk
was
rough
under
his
feet
the
street
was
asphalt
instead
of
concrete
mars
and
venus
were
in
quadrature
it
must
be
quite
early
because
venus
sets
not
too
many
hours
after
sol
there
was
a
light
blanked
out
in
an
electric
sign
advertising
some
obscure
brand
of
cigarettes
merr
cool
and
paul
wondered
quickly
whether
the
missing
space
represented
or
because
he
did
not
smoke
that
brand
a
convertible
coupe
roared
past
with
a
redhead
hair
blowing
back
there
was
a
dent
in
the
hubcap
the
police
squad
car
was
number
a
woman
that
paul
instantly
catalogued
as
the
dowager
sniffed
and
turned
away
a
girl
giggled
as
her
boy
friend
led
her
towards
a
cocktail
lounge
the
handcuffs
jangled
and
caused
more
attention
than
the
presence
of
the
policeman
down
the
street
a
theatre
marquee
flashed
advertising
a
stage
production
called
bright
young
man
as
it
caught
eye
the
box
office
closed
and
the
theatre
marquee
went
dark
then
having
noted
more
of
his
urban
surroundings
during
thirteen
seconds
spent
in
crossing
a
sidewalk
than
he
had
in
several
years
of
living
there
paul
found
himself
installed
in
the
front
seat
of
the
police
car
between
two
burly
officers
paul
was
not
a
small
man
but
he
felt
like
a
midget
between
them
there
was
no
noticeable
grinding
of
gears
nor
jerkiness
as
the
car
swooped
away
from
the
curb
and
the
siren
wailed
to
clear
the
street
before
them
expertly
the
driver
maneuvered
through
a
red
light
and
turned
against
traffic
swerving
in
and
among
the
hesitant
cars
like
a
fencer
then
they
were
beyond
the
busy
thoroughfare
and
racing
down
a
quiet
street
their
own
siren
creating
a
shrill
that
could
be
heard
for
blocks
even
inside
of
the
car
it
was
loud
outside
it
must
have
been
terrific
the
radio
broke
into
life
attention
attention
all
cars
attention
the
driver
and
the
other
policeman
stiffened
slightly
the
driver
turned
another
corner
onto
a
traffic
street
three
or
four
blocks
along
the
bright
blue
lights
of
the
police
station
called
like
a
lighthouse
marking
the
journey
end
attention
attention
said
the
radio
all
cars
be
on
the
lookout
for
police
squad
car
seventeen
stolen
the
policeman
not
driving
was
fumbling
in
a
pocket
found
a
jangling
set
of
keys
and
fumbled
with
them
uncertainly
then
grayson
manacles
fell
away
as
the
squad
car
drove
up
in
front
of
the
police
station
lively
grayson
snapped
the
driver
as
the
car
came
to
a
quiet
halt
still
in
a
complete
daze
paul
obeyed
stiffly
he
followed
the
driver
out
of
the
squad
car
from
the
driver
side
squeezing
under
the
steering
wheel
and
forced
by
the
pressure
of
the
other
policeman
behind
him
he
was
unceremoniously
hauled
into
a
waiting
sedan
pushed
again
from
behind
and
then
before
he
could
get
his
balance
the
car
lurched
forward
and
away
that
kill
chuckled
the
policeman
that
had
rescued
him
from
the
stage
dump
their
rig
and
the
drunken
cops
right
in
front
of
the
station
chuckled
the
driver
of
the
police
car
both
were
shucking
their
blue
uniforms
and
the
driver
of
the
large
sedan
was
not
driving
like
a
maniac
he
kept
to
sane
speeds
but
used
side
streets
stolen
murmured
grayson
paul
was
still
dazed
something
was
going
on
but
he
did
not
know
what
he
had
been
ridiculed
charged
with
murder
arrested
and
but
he
had
not
really
been
arrested
for
these
were
not
officers
of
the
law
wha
what
he
blurted
both
of
the
erstwhile
officers
laughed
one
of
them
hauled
a
small
flask
from
his
hip
pocket
and
handed
it
to
paul
you
had
a
rough
time
he
said
take
a
bracer
paul
took
a
big
swallow
it
was
good
whiskey
that
burned
just
right
on
the
way
down
the
glow
in
paul
stomach
took
some
of
the
troubled
puzzlement
some
of
the
daze
from
him
but
the
dizziness
and
the
feeling
of
unreality
remained
what
it
all
about
asked
paul
uncertainly
you
find
out
later
why
not
now
and
spill
before
the
boss
tells
his
tale
laughed
one
of
the
men
just
pull
yourself
together
grayson
be
happy
that
we
got
you
out
of
a
bad
spot
i
am
but
i
do
understand
you
will
soon
enough
take
it
easy
paul
relaxed
it
was
obvious
that
they
would
tell
him
nothing
some
of
the
daze
left
but
it
left
paul
with
mixed
emotions
convinced
of
his
own
innocence
of
any
crime
equally
convinced
of
his
correctness
regarding
haedaecker
theory
but
completely
bewildered
as
to
the
latest
mixup
with
central
angry
about
stacey
paul
grayson
was
convinced
that
the
right
way
to
handle
false
charges
was
and
is
to
face
them
firmly
and
display
the
fact
that
you
have
nothing
to
fear
he
had
always
felt
that
the
very
display
of
and
obvious
indignation
over
the
accusations
would
carry
some
weight
in
his
favor
he
had
read
of
cases
in
the
newspapers
where
the
murderer
was
found
with
the
smoking
gun
in
his
pocket
and
the
blood
on
his
hands
but
still
protested
complete
innocence
in
a
manner
but
paul
felt
that
such
protestation
could
carry
no
weight
because
the
lawbreaker
could
not
be
convincing
with
the
truth
in
his
mind
working
against
him
like
everybody
paul
felt
that
he
was
different
this
was
a
different
case
they
would
believe
him
so
paul
disliked
the
idea
of
running
running
away
was
itself
an
indication
of
guilt
he
had
never
been
able
to
define
the
proper
line
between
the
desire
for
privacy
and
the
necessity
of
keeping
something
under
cover
like
many
other
idealists
paul
felt
that
any
man
whose
life
was
blameless
should
not
object
to
scrutiny
but
in
this
particular
case
even
while
paul
was
objecting
to
the
idea
of
running
preferring
to
face
the
music
with
his
convincing
innocence
paul
was
also
aware
that
one
man
facing
the
anger
of
a
mob
can
do
very
little
to
make
them
listen
he
shrugged
as
a
more
pleasant
thought
came
to
him
he
could
easily
show
proof
that
his
escape
was
not
the
flight
caused
by
guilt
but
the
honest
fear
of
bodily
harm
from
a
mob
incited
to
by
the
machinations
of
a
personal
enemy
paul
sat
up
a
bit
relieved
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
recognized
the
street
they
were
about
half
way
between
the
middle
of
the
city
and
the
spaceport
maybe
now
he
might
be
able
to
collect
some
more
information
still
the
idealist
paul
could
not
understand
why
any
man
would
work
violently
against
a
common
blessing
that
could
cause
no
harm
paul
believed
that
the
possibility
of
opening
communications
with
neoterra
was
such
a
blessing
but
merely
starting
with
a
hope
and
an
idea
to
help
mankind
and
make
himself
famous
paul
had
triggered
off
some
inexplicable
train
of
events
which
included
murder
theft
falsification
of
evidence
impersonation
impersonation
not
only
once
but
twice
twice
had
paul
been
impersonated
for
some
reason
or
another
now
there
had
been
the
impersonation
of
policemen
twice
this
impersonation
could
have
been
directed
only
at
paul
discomfort
now
he
looked
at
the
two
men
that
sat
on
either
side
of
him
friends
or
enemies
had
they
helped
him
or
had
they
captured
him
for
themselves
and
in
either
case
what
were
they
going
to
do
with
him
after
they
had
taken
him
where
the
car
turned
a
sharp
corner
slowed
in
front
of
a
large
house
and
turned
into
the
driveway
the
address
was
bridge
street
the
elderly
gentleman
eyed
paul
quietly
stacey
had
described
the
man
as
a
doddering
old
fogy
if
this
were
really
hoagland
or
really
the
same
man
that
stacey
met
but
somewhere
stacey
evaluation
of
people
must
have
fallen
flat
for
hoagland
was
only
of
stacey
description
he
was
neither
doddering
nor
a
fogy
he
was
old
in
grayson
eyes
he
looked
he
might
have
been
older
for
his
type
of
man
tends
to
retain
the
appearance
of
youth
there
was
a
bit
of
spring
to
his
walk
and
a
set
to
his
jaw
a
sharpness
to
his
eyes
and
a
complete
about
hoagland
he
was
far
from
bald
but
the
hair
was
he
wore
it
carelessly
but
not
unkempt
it
was
a
sort
of
pride
paul
guessed
to
a
feature
prized
and
lost
to
other
men
please
sit
down
and
relax
he
said
his
voice
was
hard
and
and
not
a
trace
of
instead
it
crackled
with
virility
you
might
as
well
take
it
easy
and
save
your
strength
you
not
going
anywhere
what
is
this
all
about
we
get
to
that
shortly
i
have
not
had
this
privilege
before
i
am
charles
hoagland
mister
grayson
i
gather
that
my
boys
were
timely
it
was
paul
started
but
stopped
lamely
the
puzzlement
welled
up
in
him
again
and
confusion
filled
him
confusion
that
contrasted
sharply
with
this
man
who
seemed
to
know
all
of
the
answers
i
am
glad
a
troublesome
mob
is
a
dangerous
thing
you
might
have
been
harmed
paul
nodded
his
head
quietly
mister
grayson
you
are
a
busy
little
man
grayson
stiffened
he
did
not
like
the
appellation
even
though
he
knew
that
his
size
was
sufficient
to
give
him
tolerance
at
being
called
little
he
did
not
have
to
prove
otherwise
just
what
do
you
want
with
me
demanded
paul
mister
grayson
either
you
are
a
genius
or
an
idealistic
fumbler
we
hope
to
find
out
which
when
you
find
out
will
you
let
me
know
snapped
paul
sarcastically
be
only
too
happy
to
smiled
hoagland
so
we
start
now
just
how
solid
are
your
theories
about
the
paul
shrugged
how
solid
is
any
theory
about
anything
let
not
argue
i
am
not
arguing
i
am
stating
a
fact
you
are
stating
an
argument
you
have
just
answered
a
direct
question
with
a
hypothetical
proposition
paul
grunted
may
i
ask
you
a
direct
question
ask
i
may
even
answer
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
question
then
just
how
solid
is
your
knowledge
of
science
any
science
sketchy
some
men
hire
carpenters
some
hire
accountants
i
hire
scientists
then
let
me
explain
my
first
reply
any
scientific
theory
undergoes
several
transformations
before
it
is
an
accepted
fact
for
instance
some
phenomenon
is
caught
or
observed
by
some
experimenter
to
explain
the
phenomenon
the
scientist
suggests
an
hypothesis
to
further
the
art
the
hypothesis
is
expanded
so
that
other
experiments
can
be
performed
these
have
the
dubious
character
of
predictions
if
is
the
explanation
then
if
we
do
then
will
take
place
physical
laws
and
limitations
are
set
up
and
while
one
group
works
according
to
these
laws
another
group
will
try
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
same
effect
can
be
produced
because
of
some
other
proposition
frequently
the
original
observation
produces
erroneous
evidence
and
then
the
conditions
are
changed
to
meet
the
experimental
evidence
as
such
progress
is
made
eventually
the
original
hypothesis
will
become
a
theory
in
shorter
words
continued
paul
thoughtfully
an
hypothesis
is
a
suggestion
untested
a
theory
is
an
hypothesis
which
is
undergoing
test
and
for
which
some
basis
of
truth
is
evident
a
fact
is
a
theory
for
which
there
is
considerably
more
favorable
evidence
than
unfavorable
evidence
and
a
law
is
a
fact
against
which
no
one
has
ever
come
up
with
any
evidence
to
dispute
it
hoagland
smiled
tolerantly
and
what
is
grayson
principle
and
why
is
this
called
a
haedaecker
theory
is
that
the
will
not
cross
interstellar
space
because
of
the
lack
of
solar
activity
grayson
principle
is
that
the
can
be
made
to
cross
interstellar
space
under
one
certain
condition
and
that
this
condition
is
a
prime
limitation
even
in
communications
the
terminology
smiled
paul
is
like
so
many
other
names
pedantically
it
is
a
principle
because
it
is
a
prime
factor
on
the
other
hand
the
name
has
a
sort
of
ring
to
it
when
spoken
aloud
i
have
an
idea
that
is
put
before
the
because
of
the
auditory
ring
ending
a
name
with
a
sibilant
makes
the
possessive
case
difficult
constant
rings
better
to
the
ear
than
factor
and
law
is
easier
to
manipulate
than
principle
these
are
not
selected
deliberately
they
are
chosen
inadvertently
by
lecturers
who
tend
to
emphasize
a
phrase
by
its
sound
even
the
unskilled
lecturer
will
do
this
a
pure
scientist
with
no
grandiose
ideas
will
automatically
select
a
name
that
presents
no
lingual
hoagland
smiled
ah
how
we
progress
behind
the
scenes
from
to
because
of
headline
newsprint
space
semantics
was
a
fine
definitive
term
until
korzybski
got
the
word
involved
with
dialectics
possibly
korzybski
decided
that
rang
better
to
the
ear
than
but
let
get
back
to
grayson
principle
take
it
from
there
mister
grayson
the
main
idea
is
i
know
the
main
idea
that
was
your
hypothesis
unsupported
by
evidence
what
i
am
interested
in
is
whether
grayson
principle
has
what
it
takes
to
become
grayson
theory
i
you
mean
was
i
successful
at
last
you
have
arrived
at
the
salient
point
i
mean
exactly
that
i
do
quite
know
you
received
a
message
on
proxima
yes
then
paul
grunted
everybody
knows
more
about
this
than
i
do
i
received
a
message
i
was
then
informed
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
have
received
a
message
because
central
was
not
running
how
do
you
account
for
this
message
i
ca
maybe
and
here
paul
looked
hoagland
in
the
eye
maybe
miss
nora
phillips
can
explain
who
nora
phillips
said
paul
sharply
or
have
you
never
met
her
should
i
have
met
her
look
hoagland
said
paul
evenly
i
do
know
what
this
is
all
about
you
got
the
chips
and
the
cards
and
the
dice
your
playfellows
accused
me
of
complications
in
the
murder
of
john
stacey
ergo
you
must
have
heard
of
him
and
stacey
only
connection
with
you
is
because
he
was
engaged
by
me
to
find
out
what
kind
of
game
nora
phillips
was
playing
with
me
since
you
know
the
connection
all
along
the
line
you
are
also
aware
of
the
fact
that
nora
phillips
entered
this
house
and
that
stacey
came
here
seeking
her
having
informed
me
of
the
first
fact
so
since
we
all
aware
of
some
of
the
facts
not
play
any
more
games
than
necessary
to
save
face
huh
you
talk
rather
boldly
for
a
man
in
your
position
hell
eternal
bells
should
i
grovel
in
fear
you
and
whatever
other
factions
are
shoving
me
around
obviously
want
me
alive
for
some
obscure
reason
otherwise
i
have
been
eliminated
instead
of
impersonated
so
long
as
i
am
alive
i
can
continue
to
hope
for
the
future
oh
we
have
no
intention
of
eliminating
you
then
what
this
mad
game
all
about
we
have
no
intentions
of
forearming
you
either
paul
shrugged
it
will
be
useless
for
you
to
deny
that
all
this
mess
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
and
neoterra
hoagland
eyed
paul
humorously
my
young
friend
you
have
the
makings
of
wisdom
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
realize
that
your
only
cry
to
importance
is
your
firm
belief
in
the
error
of
haedaecker
theory
maybe
you
wo
mind
explaining
one
small
item
maybe
if
for
some
reason
i
am
in
your
way
because
of
the
why
was
a
man
impersonating
me
who
could
only
impersonate
me
for
a
limited
time
occasionally
said
hoagland
loftily
some
broad
highway
to
somewhere
must
be
blocked
for
a
limited
time
only
so
i
got
a
crack
on
the
skull
that
would
last
eventually
a
man
impersonating
me
would
head
for
proxima
i
to
do
something
there
god
knows
what
while
the
real
paul
grayson
was
free
to
complain
to
everybody
that
he
was
really
not
on
proxima
i
doing
his
job
someone
slipped
supposing
hoagland
suggested
that
you
were
held
incommunicado
while
your
double
went
to
proxima
i
and
performed
your
job
complete
with
the
automatic
motion
picture
cameras
you
installed
for
ah
posterity
and
haedaecker
greatness
your
double
returns
and
hands
in
his
your
report
later
the
man
leaves
for
parts
unknown
and
you
are
released
complete
with
the
conviction
that
yelling
to
the
authorities
about
your
imprisonment
would
be
at
variance
with
the
report
the
pictures
and
the
job
completion
everything
is
done
as
your
ultimate
superior
wants
it
done
and
then
you
go
to
him
complaining
that
you
were
held
prisoner
or
would
you
grayson
well
i
hoagland
laughed
heartily
you
might
if
you
were
the
simple
honest
soul
but
paul
grayson
has
been
making
plans
to
test
the
on
proxima
i
for
a
long
time
and
could
afford
to
have
someone
asking
questions
as
to
why
paul
grayson
got
himself
into
a
cockeyed
mess
but
what
would
it
accomplish
stall
you
for
some
time
in
the
back
of
paul
mind
there
was
a
picture
of
a
very
attractive
woman
offering
up
eager
lips
and
the
warmth
of
a
vibrant
body
beneath
sheer
silk
setting
up
the
clay
target
he
had
to
know
he
did
not
want
to
merely
guess
the
answer
he
but
nora
phillips
had
turned
up
just
as
haedaecker
was
getting
nasty
had
she
turned
up
to
stall
haedaecker
hoagland
wanted
the
business
stalled
for
some
reason
actions
appeared
to
be
that
of
someone
bent
upon
aiding
grayson
even
in
the
long
run
her
falsification
of
the
reception
on
proxima
i
was
one
step
in
getting
mankind
interested
in
the
problem
of
communicating
with
neoterra
so
you
erased
him
when
he
failed
i
mean
hoagland
looked
unhappy
unfortunate
but
necessary
however
joel
walsh
was
a
type
of
character
that
mankind
can
well
do
without
grayson
grunted
angrily
why
not
bump
him
first
until
he
proved
completely
useless
he
had
a
place
said
hoagland
coldly
there
just
enough
bad
in
the
best
of
us
to
quote
an
old
cliche
i
suppose
when
a
player
has
enough
pawns
he
can
afford
to
sacrifice
only
useless
pawns
paul
looked
sourly
cynical
and
i
am
the
white
knight
hoagland
smiled
affably
and
you
balance
very
badly
while
sliding
down
that
poker
again
your
humility
signifies
the
beginning
of
great
wisdom
i
hardly
call
you
a
bishop
paul
snorted
through
his
nose
if
we
want
to
make
some
more
puns
he
said
flatly
i
admit
that
i
been
rooked
but
who
is
the
queen
in
this
mad
game
nora
phillips
hardly
you
mean
you
not
tell
me
the
objective
okay
hoagland
we
play
one
more
gambit
i
suppose
the
capture
of
the
white
knight
is
worth
the
sacrifice
of
two
pawns
hoagland
smiled
i
call
it
the
capture
of
a
rook
as
well
as
the
white
knight
for
did
you
say
pawns
grayson
eyed
hoagland
distastefully
who
was
the
guy
on
proxima
proxima
paul
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
the
first
feeling
of
returning
that
he
had
enjoyed
since
the
moment
of
his
downfall
in
the
lecture
hall
hoagland
he
said
you
made
me
very
happy
how
snapped
the
other
i
always
had
the
conviction
that
god
was
a
swell
fellow
who
like
the
rest
of
us
was
still
seeking
the
completely
holy
truth
but
happy
understand
in
knowing
that
he
did
not
really
know
everything
because
when
he
did
there
was
no
more
future
for
him
for
us
for
anybody
equally
is
the
devil
who
does
not
know
everything
either
hoagland
you
just
a
minor
devil
what
do
you
mean
there
was
a
guy
on
proxima
about
to
impersonate
me
or
maybe
impersonate
the
impersonation
you
provided
i
can
see
one
faction
bumping
off
parties
of
the
second
part
but
hoagland
old
devil
if
you
do
know
about
the
mess
on
proxima
you
do
know
that
instead
of
one
conflicting
faction
against
you
you
got
two
because
the
guy
you
did
not
know
about
was
polished
off
by
another
gang
that
you
do
not
know
about
how
do
you
like
them
apples
hoagland
blew
out
a
breath
that
sounded
like
the
sigh
of
autumn
chapter
considering
that
the
time
elapsed
between
paul
first
contact
with
nora
phillips
and
his
meeting
with
hoagland
was
less
than
one
month
during
which
paul
lived
in
an
incomprehensible
maelstrom
the
following
ten
months
were
sheer
boredom
for
paul
was
removed
from
bridge
street
and
taken
aboard
a
spacecraft
bound
for
neoterra
one
hundred
and
forty
light
years
by
distance
and
three
hundred
and
eighteen
days
by
the
fastest
spaceliner
going
ten
months
plus
spent
in
a
shell
of
metal
completely
there
were
no
viewports
for
a
ship
exceeding
the
speed
of
light
was
enclosed
in
its
own
warp
of
space
and
one
could
not
see
out
there
was
a
broad
for
the
landing
and
pilot
but
looking
out
through
that
dome
of
glass
into
the
awesome
nothingness
of
supervelocity
made
men
a
little
bit
crazy
some
went
stark
mad
time
was
measured
by
ship
clocks
and
ship
calendars
timed
in
networks
from
the
master
that
measured
the
in
microseconds
from
the
moment
of
superdrive
until
the
end
of
the
flight
paul
had
a
lot
of
time
to
think
but
nothing
to
do
eventually
paul
knew
that
thinking
supplied
nothing
but
additional
complications
introduced
by
his
own
mind
by
the
time
the
trip
was
half
over
the
network
of
fact
and
fiction
revolving
around
nora
phillips
was
so
involved
that
any
single
additional
fact
would
have
destroyed
the
whole
picture
nora
was
either
angel
or
it
was
the
latter
reasoning
that
stopped
paul
from
brooding
over
the
problem
paul
wanted
neither
saint
nor
one
was
untouchable
and
the
other
undesirable
paul
wanted
an
uninhibited
loveliness
with
the
indefinably
correct
admixture
of
bawdiness
and
propriety
of
madonna
and
magdalene
of
soul
and
sex
mens
in
sana
as
julius
caesar
would
have
put
it
the
fact
that
the
galactic
network
was
progressing
week
by
week
only
gratified
paul
even
though
he
knew
that
someone
else
was
racing
madly
back
and
forth
across
the
checking
the
signals
in
one
after
the
other
all
grayson
needed
was
the
initial
radio
contact
the
contact
could
progress
from
there
to
while
away
the
time
paul
called
upon
his
memory
to
fill
in
the
spaces
between
the
stellar
radio
stations
between
sol
and
neosol
he
did
this
with
the
aid
of
the
pilot
star
maps
which
were
made
available
to
him
it
was
a
flat
map
instead
of
the
necessary
for
true
distances
but
it
served
as
well
as
a
mercator
projection
of
the
earth
which
is
a
spherical
body
and
far
from
flat
in
the
space
model
the
first
link
was
to
proxima
a
sort
of
test
link
started
some
time
before
the
rest
there
were
four
other
links
that
led
from
sol
to
nearby
stars
spread
out
in
from
one
another
from
these
each
had
three
or
four
lines
out
and
still
away
from
sol
some
crossing
the
near
gap
and
some
crossing
back
between
the
other
stations
until
a
complete
pyramidal
of
solid
triangulation
was
obtained
then
across
the
longer
reaches
of
space
links
were
running
between
stations
these
would
complete
other
across
the
galaxy
year
by
year
until
the
final
radio
beam
from
sol
to
neosol
landed
one
hundred
and
forty
years
from
the
start
each
completed
link
between
star
and
star
would
improve
the
surveying
of
the
galaxy
and
bring
neosol
dimensional
error
down
and
down
through
the
banks
of
figures
best
stated
by
exponents
of
ten
astronomers
work
in
light
years
man
works
in
miles
an
error
of
a
month
in
light
years
is
not
much
error
but
an
error
of
million
miles
is
still
a
long
way
for
man
to
so
paul
made
a
planar
chart
of
the
galaxy
between
sol
and
neosol
and
from
memory
and
calculations
he
filled
in
week
by
week
the
completed
links
the
first
linkage
had
been
computed
and
started
so
that
a
small
group
of
men
of
which
paul
was
one
could
race
from
star
to
star
the
arrival
of
the
radio
beam
it
took
ten
days
to
go
from
sol
to
proxima
the
rest
of
the
network
had
been
started
so
that
at
the
best
of
astronomical
calculations
the
whole
pattern
would
end
up
one
after
the
other
spread
apart
long
enough
to
enable
the
group
of
to
go
from
station
to
station
the
map
would
not
be
fixed
stars
move
with
respect
to
one
another
and
this
factor
would
be
part
of
the
measurements
on
a
star
map
or
planetarium
this
motion
was
impossible
to
show
from
one
year
to
the
next
these
were
stars
but
for
data
fed
into
the
elecalc
to
determine
the
time
of
drive
the
angle
and
the
velocity
the
finest
measurement
of
distance
was
none
too
good
but
even
some
grasp
of
the
true
immensity
of
space
with
its
tiny
pinpricks
of
solid
matter
scattered
sparsely
in
a
vastness
of
sheer
black
nothing
was
lost
on
the
travellers
between
sol
and
neosol
for
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
the
journey
was
not
much
longer
than
the
famous
voyage
of
columbus
miles
meant
nothing
there
were
too
many
of
them
time
was
the
essence
and
ten
long
months
passed
between
and
the
ultimate
recovery
of
their
own
time
and
space
where
the
cheerful
stars
winked
out
of
a
sky
the
dispersion
was
not
too
bad
neosol
was
a
away
at
about
a
degree
angle
from
their
course
and
position
the
of
the
elecalc
went
to
work
in
the
course
computing
room
and
once
more
the
ship
took
to
the
silent
black
vastness
of
supervelocity
until
the
second
drop
into
reality
they
were
a
miles
from
neoterra
on
the
second
hop
and
there
was
no
room
to
use
supervelocity
now
so
the
next
few
hours
were
spent
in
matching
the
galactic
drift
of
neosol
and
finally
neoterra
but
after
ten
months
of
living
in
an
capsule
of
metal
a
half
day
of
jockeying
before
landing
was
pleasant
but
as
the
ship
started
to
drop
down
toward
the
planet
paul
realized
with
a
shock
that
it
was
neoterra
as
as
paul
was
even
he
could
not
tell
one
star
or
one
sun
from
another
until
something
more
featureless
is
offered
for
comparison
the
planet
was
definitely
not
neoterra
and
this
paul
knew
only
because
it
obviously
bore
no
atmosphere
all
he
could
be
sure
of
was
that
this
star
was
close
to
neoterra
as
stellar
distances
went
but
which
star
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
he
knew
that
the
star
was
not
neosol
because
none
of
the
planets
of
neosol
were
without
atmosphere
such
an
absolutely
minimum
of
negative
evidence
could
only
tell
paul
where
he
was
not
he
was
not
on
a
planet
of
sol
nor
neosol
as
the
ship
came
close
to
the
surface
of
this
planet
paul
noted
the
station
below
them
and
here
his
recollection
bore
fruit
this
planet
was
of
a
star
about
five
light
years
from
neosol
he
thought
carefully
the
star
from
sol
bore
no
more
than
a
catalog
number
being
of
insufficient
size
to
warrant
notice
by
the
ancients
who
gave
the
stars
their
names
someone
had
dubbed
the
planet
harrigan
horror
in
dubious
honor
of
lew
harrigan
who
had
been
the
engineer
who
put
up
the
relay
station
and
had
lived
in
for
several
months
harrigan
himself
would
be
coming
to
harrigan
horror
in
about
two
months
to
check
in
the
arrival
of
the
beam
from
neoterra
just
as
paul
had
gone
to
proxima
ten
months
before
just
what
hoagland
crew
of
cutthroats
intended
to
do
on
harrigan
horror
paul
could
not
determine
from
the
myriad
of
unpleasant
possibilities
he
could
conjure
up
but
he
knew
and
he
was
not
wrong
that
they
would
tell
him
very
soon
below
them
a
half
mile
or
so
from
the
relay
station
a
small
spacecraft
stood
with
its
nose
in
the
air
the
big
spacecraft
landed
near
the
small
one
and
paul
was
handed
a
space
suit
get
in
said
evans
evans
had
been
one
of
the
back
on
terra
what
next
asked
paul
get
in
you
find
out
why
not
let
me
in
on
it
you
learn
get
in
it
or
we
be
glad
to
take
you
out
across
this
airless
planet
without
a
suit
that
would
do
you
much
good
no
the
man
attitude
convinced
paul
that
this
was
the
termination
of
any
idea
of
keeping
him
alive
up
to
now
they
had
been
saving
him
obviously
for
this
paul
faith
in
the
idea
that
kidnapers
do
not
kill
people
after
keeping
them
alive
for
almost
a
year
began
to
wane
for
some
reason
it
had
been
necessary
to
keep
paul
alive
this
long
but
now
but
paul
had
no
intention
of
dying
by
going
out
across
horror
in
his
city
clothing
paul
looked
across
the
face
of
harrigan
horror
and
blinked
the
huge
emblazoned
registry
number
was
around
the
side
of
the
space
ship
but
paul
knew
every
rivet
in
her
that
ship
was
paul
burast
a
glimmer
of
hope
came
he
got
into
the
space
suit
and
was
led
across
to
the
smaller
ship
by
evans
a
pilot
in
the
burast
ship
let
them
in
through
the
airlock
and
swung
his
helmet
back
over
his
head
and
greeted
evans
glumly
thought
you
never
get
here
he
said
when
did
you
take
off
hour
after
you
did
been
here
long
hundred
and
seven
hours
sol
paul
looked
around
everything
was
in
place
everything
in
order
what
goes
on
he
asked
evans
turned
to
him
i
do
mind
telling
you
hoagland
has
no
intention
of
letting
you
or
anybody
else
start
this
business
between
here
and
home
then
why
this
stuff
why
this
you
stirred
up
enough
interest
to
make
some
men
curious
now
stop
it
paul
scowled
at
evans
look
he
said
testily
this
communications
is
not
going
to
die
with
me
killing
one
man
is
going
to
stop
curiosity
one
bit
evans
laughed
you
stolen
a
spacecraft
belonging
to
the
bureau
of
astrogation
the
one
filled
with
gear
a
fugitive
from
justice
you
come
to
this
station
which
will
be
the
next
radio
beacon
checked
in
which
is
also
close
enough
to
neoterra
central
for
you
to
make
connection
and
get
whatever
contact
you
need
for
your
line
across
space
now
grayson
item
one
your
ship
is
a
bit
because
of
a
hard
landing
so
you
ca
take
off
you
been
very
busy
laying
a
line
from
the
station
to
your
ship
so
you
can
tap
into
the
radio
beacon
and
so
you
used
up
quite
a
bit
of
your
air
since
you
have
not
the
keys
to
this
station
you
can
not
get
in
there
and
besides
you
find
that
your
space
suit
is
inclined
to
be
dangerously
leaky
in
shorter
words
you
trapped
on
this
ship
for
want
of
air
and
you
find
that
whatever
you
think
you
can
think
of
several
others
have
thought
of
it
first
and
done
something
about
it
item
two
harrigan
will
not
be
checking
this
station
upon
like
the
rest
it
is
automatic
and
it
will
register
harrigan
is
going
to
be
very
busy
elsewhere
in
other
words
find
that
your
one
chance
for
salvation
is
to
establish
communications
back
to
neoterra
so
you
can
call
for
help
item
three
regardless
of
what
you
do
about
it
you
will
be
found
here
about
four
months
from
now
the
victim
of
asphyxiation
caused
by
being
trapped
here
you
will
have
done
a
major
effort
toward
making
your
gadget
work
having
failed
in
the
moment
of
desperation
the
two
worlds
will
hear
about
it
and
men
will
then
discount
your
wild
theories
and
if
i
should
succeed
you
wo
we
better
than
that
in
other
words
harrigan
is
a
friend
of
yours
that
part
of
it
and
i
suppose
when
i
found
there
will
be
all
sorts
of
records
and
data
and
frantic
experimentation
to
show
that
i
tried
and
failed
you
get
closer
and
closer
all
the
time
but
you
ca
stop
progress
maybe
we
do
want
progress
completely
stopped
only
stalled
for
some
time
but
what
reason
can
you
give
we
not
stating
any
reasons
grayson
we
have
our
reasons
and
to
us
they
good
ones
but
stow
it
grayson
and
have
a
good
time
paul
got
a
good
view
of
the
picture
after
they
left
his
masquerader
might
have
returned
from
proxima
i
with
honest
data
about
the
beam
but
paul
grayson
might
as
well
have
been
found
in
a
wrecked
landing
on
terra
with
evidence
that
indicated
complete
failure
in
the
there
or
here
what
difference
so
in
the
next
few
hours
paul
ransacked
his
spacecraft
in
complete
futility
he
was
trapped
on
harrigan
horror
had
paul
been
ten
times
as
proficient
as
he
was
with
tools
and
calculations
the
burast
still
would
have
remained
where
it
stood
snuggled
down
in
the
ground
of
harrigan
horror
his
spacesuit
the
one
they
left
him
was
nothing
to
wear
while
wandering
around
on
the
sunside
of
a
planet
he
doubted
whether
he
could
cross
the
distance
between
the
burast
and
the
relay
station
even
had
he
the
air
to
spare
of
course
he
had
quite
a
bit
of
air
both
bottled
and
revitalized
from
the
greenery
in
the
hold
but
the
greenery
was
none
too
healthy
and
the
bottled
goods
was
almost
gone
his
compressor
could
have
been
made
to
work
and
paul
could
have
made
it
to
the
station
but
for
what
to
stand
there
and
die
or
to
die
along
the
route
in
a
leaky
suit
breaking
into
a
fort
was
no
more
problem
than
breaching
a
relay
station
from
the
ground
they
had
been
built
to
last
for
years
against
wind
erosion
burglars
pirates
the
pressures
of
the
inner
air
against
airless
planets
such
as
this
but
paul
problem
was
not
merely
escape
he
might
have
tried
to
make
the
relay
station
if
this
place
offered
any
hope
even
then
paul
might
have
been
able
as
a
measure
to
break
into
the
relay
station
somehow
assuming
that
he
could
break
into
the
station
that
would
let
the
air
out
the
only
way
one
could
break
into
such
a
station
without
letting
the
air
out
would
be
through
the
airlock
and
breaking
into
that
sort
of
construction
was
no
easier
than
cracking
the
wall
without
letting
the
air
out
the
nearest
radio
receiving
set
was
five
light
years
away
at
neosol
and
if
he
could
beam
the
radio
call
it
would
take
five
years
he
looked
at
the
equipment
and
thought
could
it
whatever
the
rest
of
the
universe
thought
about
paul
grayson
and
his
idea
about
the
paul
still
had
faith
furthermore
he
knew
as
much
about
gear
as
any
other
man
alive
up
to
and
including
haedaecker
himself
evans
said
that
the
would
work
how
bad
could
they
foul
equipment
could
they
foul
the
junk
so
bad
that
paul
would
be
able
to
make
repair
or
would
they
paul
tried
the
radio
naturally
it
was
silent
but
it
was
not
dead
it
gave
a
rattle
of
cosmic
static
four
thundering
blasts
came
in
across
the
wave
band
four
of
the
beacon
outgoing
transmitters
unmodulated
directed
at
other
stations
across
space
to
the
nearer
stars
he
tried
listening
along
the
frequencies
of
the
local
oscillators
of
the
receiving
sets
set
to
collect
any
incoming
beacons
but
he
realized
that
they
would
not
be
turned
on
yet
there
was
a
point
in
keeping
the
transmitters
on
but
there
was
no
use
in
turning
on
a
receiver
four
or
five
years
before
the
signal
got
there
he
hit
another
transmitter
and
as
he
listened
to
the
unmodulated
signal
it
began
to
pip
in
a
sequence
that
some
technician
would
use
five
to
fifteen
or
more
years
from
now
when
it
arrived
at
some
other
they
had
not
fouled
the
radio
but
that
was
like
letting
a
prisoner
on
antarctica
keep
his
not
worth
a
damn
for
helping
him
escape
paul
then
tried
the
it
was
not
dead
so
far
as
paul
could
tell
it
did
not
crackle
with
cosmic
static
but
there
was
a
faint
hiss
paul
wondered
about
the
connection
to
the
station
across
the
plain
they
must
have
some
sort
of
connection
otherwise
the
evidence
would
not
ring
true
paul
began
to
tune
the
receiver
just
partly
in
hope
and
partly
for
lack
of
something
to
do
damn
he
swore
grayson
grayson
that
you
paul
blinked
hearing
things
grayson
paul
grayson
is
that
you
paul
grabbed
the
microphone
like
a
drowning
man
clutching
a
straw
hello
hello
neoterra
this
is
paul
grayson
marooned
on
horror
with
a
low
air
supply
i
about
two
miles
from
the
radio
beac
grayson
forget
it
i
know
where
you
are
this
is
neoterra
this
is
your
old
friend
evans
waiting
around
in
space
until
you
stop
trying
things
for
all
we
know
you
might
be
able
to
figure
a
way
out
take
it
easy
pal
such
energy
takes
a
lot
of
air
and
you
have
much
left
chapter
nine
days
had
passed
according
to
the
solar
clock
on
paul
instrument
panel
nine
days
with
the
air
slowly
becoming
stale
it
was
beginning
to
smell
a
bit
now
paul
did
not
notice
it
particularly
but
someone
just
in
from
a
planetary
atmosphere
would
say
that
the
air
reeked
to
high
heaven
his
senses
were
beginning
to
numb
this
was
not
a
fast
death
but
slow
and
sordid
paul
yawned
constantly
and
took
deep
heaving
gulps
of
air
only
to
try
again
paul
fought
sleep
he
fought
it
because
he
knew
that
he
might
drift
off
to
sleep
never
to
awaken
but
he
had
no
recourse
most
of
his
time
he
spent
on
the
cot
in
the
instrument
room
because
he
had
too
little
energy
to
be
up
and
around
and
when
he
fought
himself
to
get
erect
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
curse
at
the
inert
machinery
he
had
tried
everything
he
had
considered
everything
even
up
to
and
including
the
start
of
a
diary
in
the
hope
that
someday
someone
might
find
it
but
it
was
a
fruitless
task
sort
of
like
putting
a
daily
account
on
the
bottom
of
a
cave
in
the
hope
that
someone
someday
might
investigate
the
cave
and
find
out
what
happened
he
did
not
know
the
periodicity
of
harrigan
horror
but
the
sun
still
a
catalog
number
was
running
lower
along
the
horizon
the
beacon
had
been
placed
near
enough
to
the
south
pole
of
rotation
so
that
it
could
always
look
at
the
distant
stars
to
and
from
which
the
radio
beacons
ran
this
was
a
nice
job
of
latitude
selection
regarding
the
plane
of
the
planet
ecliptic
and
rotation
for
the
galactic
survey
beams
but
paul
was
dully
uninterested
in
facts
he
slept
more
than
he
knew
and
was
awake
much
less
than
he
believed
his
dreams
were
vivid
enough
to
make
him
believe
that
he
was
awake
excepting
those
that
dealt
with
nora
phillips
and
john
stacey
neither
of
whom
could
have
been
there
he
was
asleep
dreaming
fitfully
when
the
spacecraft
dropped
down
in
a
landing
that
would
have
made
the
air
on
any
normal
planet
scream
it
came
down
at
nearly
five
gravities
its
deceleration
calculated
to
a
fine
degree
of
precision
so
that
the
moment
of
its
computation
coincided
with
the
instant
of
contact
the
drivers
ceased
and
the
ship
settled
into
the
gritty
ground
of
harrigan
horror
he
did
not
hear
the
swift
manipulation
of
the
airlock
from
the
outside
controls
grayson
came
the
cry
paul
grayson
paul
looked
up
dazedly
sitting
up
he
was
weak
and
dizzy
but
paul
pulled
himself
erect
with
the
determination
that
he
would
not
let
them
see
how
badly
off
he
was
the
very
deliberate
attempt
showed
them
showed
them
a
man
whose
cheeks
were
hollow
whose
lips
were
a
bit
blue
eyes
glazed
and
whose
mind
was
dull
he
believed
that
he
greeted
them
blithely
but
what
came
from
his
mouth
was
a
dry
croak
then
he
went
to
sleep
again
sitting
up
on
the
cot
complete
with
a
five
day
beard
and
a
nervous
system
but
they
wasted
no
time
bundling
him
into
a
spacesuit
they
let
the
air
out
of
the
burast
with
a
blast
and
hurried
him
to
their
own
ship
then
they
took
off
at
six
gravities
a
force
that
bent
them
all
into
their
cushions
it
did
not
touch
paul
he
was
dead
to
the
world
in
the
first
pleasant
honest
comfortable
sleep
he
had
since
the
air
began
to
go
foul
and
once
again
there
were
a
couple
of
days
of
timelessness
it
was
very
pleasant
to
have
someone
massage
your
muscles
to
be
steamed
to
the
point
and
then
in
a
cold
shower
followed
by
the
ministrations
of
three
dozen
professional
wrestlers
gallons
of
cold
water
and
miles
of
fresh
air
a
daily
shave
with
a
hot
towel
and
a
facial
massage
good
food
and
boiling
tea
a
pipe
of
aromatic
tobacco
hours
of
deep
sleep
and
paul
dressed
in
clean
shirt
and
slacks
and
once
more
back
to
normal
was
facing
an
elderly
gentleman
that
looked
like
santa
claus
i
come
to
the
point
said
the
elderly
gentleman
i
am
franklin
huston
i
am
one
of
a
group
of
men
whose
desire
is
completely
political
this
time
it
is
also
a
bit
personal
perhaps
you
are
one
of
the
few
men
we
can
talk
to
who
knows
something
about
nora
phillips
i
have
met
nora
phillips
we
know
i
like
to
meet
miss
phillips
again
that
all
depends
on
what
huston
spread
his
hands
possibly
upon
whether
she
is
still
alive
alive
roared
paul
yes
alive
paul
shook
his
head
if
they
killed
stacey
they
would
not
stop
at
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
stacey
was
killed
paul
looked
up
almost
a
year
ago
of
course
it
is
barely
possible
that
the
news
would
be
here
by
now
we
took
off
very
shortly
afterwards
in
a
fast
ship
and
the
official
news
might
be
still
on
the
way
huston
hit
his
palm
with
his
other
fist
we
need
something
faster
than
ten
months
he
cried
hell
we
no
better
off
than
the
pilgrims
hoping
for
some
news
from
england
grayson
what
happened
grayson
started
to
explain
but
half
way
through
he
stopped
thoughtfully
i
missed
a
point
he
said
i
do
know
that
stacey
killed
after
all
the
men
that
arrested
me
were
officers
just
henchmen
of
that
guy
hoagland
quite
now
while
there
is
a
school
that
seems
to
apply
logic
to
human
motives
or
tries
to
there
is
another
school
that
claims
that
the
way
people
do
things
are
entirely
dependent
upon
their
point
of
view
and
no
one
can
catalog
human
nature
grayson
i
known
hoagland
a
long
time
and
spent
most
of
that
time
fighting
him
one
way
or
another
he
is
as
about
murder
as
a
snake
but
he
is
a
sort
of
as
well
anyone
who
has
a
bare
chance
of
chipping
in
something
toward
the
furthering
of
hoagland
plans
he
will
keep
alive
and
it
is
no
great
problem
to
keep
them
sequestered
off
somewhere
away
from
contact
until
he
needs
for
instance
hoagland
would
be
disinclined
to
kill
nora
phillips
because
in
some
way
she
might
be
useful
to
him
if
only
as
a
hostage
john
stacey
is
another
item
stacey
might
be
kept
alive
for
some
reason
this
is
a
game
grayson
paul
grunted
unhappily
a
year
ago
i
was
a
man
hopeful
of
trying
out
an
idea
i
spent
the
last
year
being
harassed
threatened
kidnaped
and
shoved
around
it
looks
like
a
big
game
to
me
but
i
know
what
the
rules
are
or
what
the
prize
is
to
the
winning
side
you
do
it
revolves
around
me
i
can
see
any
number
of
reasons
why
people
would
go
to
bat
for
a
system
that
will
lead
to
communications
across
the
galaxy
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
see
why
anybody
would
prefer
isolation
paul
as
a
student
how
did
your
history
compare
with
your
math
none
too
well
why
did
the
puritans
leave
england
in
the
first
place
something
about
their
religion
the
books
call
it
religious
freedom
the
fact
is
more
likely
that
they
did
not
like
the
way
things
were
being
run
in
england
well
forget
that
and
tell
me
why
the
american
revolution
was
fought
because
of
taxation
balderdash
that
was
just
an
excuse
i
heard
that
roar
about
without
representation
every
fourth
of
july
since
i
was
a
kid
sure
it
was
that
but
why
why
well
because
it
took
months
for
anything
to
cross
the
ocean
letter
information
data
anything
a
representative
would
always
be
some
months
behind
the
demands
of
his
job
and
his
people
would
be
months
behind
him
the
upshot
was
that
people
were
being
ruled
note
that
i
said
from
a
distance
in
time
and
space
neoterra
is
being
ruled
by
terra
remote
in
time
and
space
at
this
moment
grayson
neoterra
can
go
in
one
of
two
ways
i
should
say
neoterra
and
the
whole
galaxy
this
is
the
crossroads
the
fork
the
place
where
one
single
decision
or
act
will
dictate
for
the
future
the
entire
history
of
mankind
among
the
stars
one
way
is
to
have
each
stellar
system
set
up
its
own
autonomous
government
an
entity
in
itself
until
at
long
last
we
have
a
million
stars
with
its
own
set
of
rules
and
regulations
and
customs
then
someday
someone
may
discover
some
means
of
cutting
down
the
between
the
stars
and
then
we
shall
have
a
fine
millenium
of
galactic
wars
for
this
reason
or
that
until
the
galaxy
is
settled
down
to
some
form
of
integrated
government
the
second
course
grayson
is
to
start
this
thing
off
with
a
solidarity
let
mankind
spread
through
the
galaxy
but
let
each
new
stellar
system
recognize
that
it
must
be
a
part
of
the
whole
and
not
a
world
in
itself
with
no
outside
interference
remember
strife
between
men
ended
with
the
community
strife
between
communities
ended
with
the
state
while
strife
between
states
ended
with
the
country
finally
strife
between
countries
ended
with
the
unification
of
terra
but
in
this
unification
there
is
plenty
of
eventually
strife
between
worlds
must
end
with
the
galactic
government
unless
we
can
bypass
the
colonization
growing
into
autonomy
and
then
formenting
strife
and
this
faction
on
neoterra
hopes
that
this
time
mankind
will
get
off
on
the
right
foot
and
the
way
to
do
it
is
to
let
people
know
on
neoterra
what
happened
on
terra
yesterday
and
not
next
year
the
huston
smiled
serene
in
your
own
little
terra
you
do
not
even
know
of
the
wrangle
we
are
now
going
through
of
course
it
takes
ten
months
for
a
fast
ship
and
the
news
is
so
remote
and
far
away
the
president
of
neoterra
will
be
elected
in
a
year
we
have
already
two
vigorous
candidates
one
of
which
is
speaking
vigorously
for
autonomy
and
freedom
from
terran
intervention
the
other
is
for
continued
harmony
promise
the
people
something
positive
and
they
will
vote
for
you
but
we
have
nothing
to
promise
save
the
interstellar
link
of
the
a
damned
poor
offering
i
say
it
was
damned
good
huston
eyed
paul
sharply
how
do
you
know
paul
opened
his
mouth
and
then
closed
it
again
i
do
know
he
said
at
last
i
think
not
good
enough
not
by
far
but
i
been
circumvented
and
frustrated
and
i
huston
slammed
a
fist
down
on
the
desk
grayson
we
found
you
and
slid
you
out
from
under
hoagland
watchful
eye
for
one
reason
only
you
stand
as
a
symbol
to
the
people
of
neoterra
you
are
a
possible
symbol
of
communications
with
paul
grayson
free
to
work
on
the
interstellar
the
political
campaign
will
get
a
transfusion
of
new
blood
when
do
i
start
huston
nodded
now
but
not
here
we
will
have
no
damned
nonsense
the
fate
of
this
political
campaign
rests
upon
your
work
i
see
that
four
months
flight
time
from
neoterra
there
is
an
equilateral
trinary
latham
triplets
one
of
the
network
beacons
is
on
latham
alpha
iv
you
will
go
to
latham
beta
iii
where
we
have
an
botanical
research
outfit
you
can
set
up
a
laboratory
there
and
go
to
work
but
why
not
go
back
to
harrigan
horror
and
pick
up
the
radio
beacon
when
it
gets
there
we
can
save
a
lot
of
time
grayson
you
are
a
symbol
you
may
be
a
tin
god
with
feet
of
clay
for
all
we
know
so
far
all
you
done
is
to
create
a
ruckus
hollering
against
haedaecker
theory
which
you
have
not
substantiated
by
any
shred
of
evidence
faith
is
a
wonderful
thing
i
wish
i
had
more
of
it
than
i
have
but
hardly
a
bulwark
against
the
slings
and
arrows
of
life
so
we
not
dicker
with
a
proposition
that
may
go
wrong
but
if
i
am
to
work
huston
smiled
serenely
i
often
wondered
why
they
call
it
science
when
the
main
idea
is
to
get
your
point
across
whether
it
is
true
or
not
we
have
no
part
of
any
experiments
that
may
deal
in
failure
you
go
and
work
on
latham
beta
iii
where
reports
of
progress
can
be
made
without
having
a
lot
of
curious
people
around
to
watch
the
answers
paul
scowled
and
it
is
going
to
take
more
than
a
week
following
the
initial
announcement
of
success
before
someone
is
going
to
try
it
from
harrigan
horror
to
neoterra
or
from
proxima
i
to
terra
itself
then
what
huston
put
the
forefingers
of
his
hands
tip
to
tip
well
you
see
it
is
not
quite
as
easy
as
you
first
imagined
it
takes
quite
a
bit
of
specialized
equipment
and
therefore
the
simple
test
will
not
work
you
be
glad
to
make
a
demonstration
but
you
are
far
too
busy
making
a
that
will
ultimately
bring
a
communication
between
terra
and
neoterra
which
is
of
course
the
final
touch
why
bother
going
through
a
lot
of
piddling
little
demonstrations
to
prove
what
you
already
know
and
in
the
meantime
in
the
meantime
grayson
you
going
to
have
to
work
like
the
very
devil
to
keep
your
research
even
with
the
reports
we
are
making
about
your
progress
paul
eyed
huston
coldly
i
suppose
that
was
the
main
idea
behind
that
conversation
i
caught
on
proxima
i
yes
nora
phillips
has
been
very
helpful
has
she
you
recognized
her
voice
yes
huston
looked
at
paul
sympathetically
i
hope
for
your
sake
as
well
as
hers
that
she
is
alive
paul
grunted
i
been
a
sucker
huston
laughed
at
him
and
you
be
a
sucker
again
paul
forget
it
for
the
moment
we
all
suckers
it
makes
life
interesting
that
way
you
get
going
and
see
what
you
can
do
remember
i
not
hamper
any
progress
but
we
will
most
certainly
see
to
it
that
any
negative
reports
are
multiplied
by
minus
one
before
they
are
made
public
so
get
what
you
need
for
experimentation
and
see
that
you
make
an
ostentatious
show
of
it
drop
a
few
hints
about
the
galactic
network
and
make
a
prediction
that
within
a
year
or
two
people
can
pick
up
a
telephone
and
talk
to
friends
on
terra
paul
eyed
huston
that
wo
be
hard
i
convinced
just
be
properly
vague
and
if
you
got
to
talk
at
length
take
a
verbal
swing
at
haedaecker
leave
the
political
angle
out
of
it
this
is
strictly
science
and
you
a
scientist
and
not
a
politician
besides
you
spent
so
much
time
that
you
lost
voting
residence
anyway
this
is
at
least
a
free
chance
for
you
to
work
grayson
i
not
too
pleased
at
the
basic
conditions
said
paul
but
i
am
pleased
at
any
chance
to
do
something
about
the
then
make
the
best
of
it
chapter
latham
triplets
alpha
beta
and
gamma
were
at
the
corners
of
an
equilateral
triangle
about
a
quarter
of
a
light
year
on
a
side
beta
iii
was
a
small
planet
possessed
of
a
somewhat
odorous
atmosphere
that
was
unpleasant
but
not
deadly
by
any
means
beta
iii
was
not
capable
of
supporting
human
life
if
by
is
meant
that
the
planet
shall
be
called
upon
to
accept
foster
and
maintain
in
growing
population
a
colony
from
terra
without
outside
assistance
a
dearth
of
light
metals
on
beta
iii
meant
that
man
got
insufficient
salt
to
maintain
the
chemical
balance
established
over
a
few
million
of
terran
years
there
was
an
abundance
of
heavy
metals
there
which
eventually
caused
an
upset
of
the
digestive
tract
there
was
also
something
or
lack
of
something
in
the
of
the
planet
and
its
edible
flora
and
fauna
that
tended
to
lower
the
rate
among
couples
who
lived
there
paul
did
not
care
to
ask
which
side
of
the
fence
huston
was
on
one
cultural
faction
wanted
this
something
or
lack
of
something
isolated
because
knowing
what
it
was
would
permit
its
eradication
and
thus
cause
a
rise
in
the
birth
rate
the
other
faction
wanted
this
something
isolated
for
reasons
best
explained
by
margaret
sanger
but
for
paul
purpose
latham
triplets
was
an
ideal
laboratory
and
proving
ground
huston
offer
was
valid
enough
he
backed
it
with
a
half
dozen
young
technicians
to
do
whatever
paul
wanted
and
included
a
group
of
three
small
but
very
fast
spacecraft
for
making
tests
in
space
itself
while
the
galactic
survey
had
picked
latham
alpha
iv
because
of
its
ecliptic
tilt
and
latham
beta
iii
was
semipopulated
by
a
few
hundred
botanical
researchers
none
of
the
other
planets
of
the
system
were
being
used
paul
selected
gamma
ii
as
the
third
relay
station
and
his
group
set
up
both
radio
beacons
and
equipment
on
each
planet
one
of
them
being
not
far
from
the
survey
station
on
alpha
iv
setting
both
gear
and
radio
beacons
in
operation
complete
with
their
timing
gear
it
was
paul
hope
to
show
that
the
arrival
of
the
radio
beacon
wave
was
coincident
with
the
establishment
of
contact
then
because
this
short
distance
did
compare
to
true
interstellar
separation
paul
would
have
a
talking
point
to
make
the
big
attempt
across
some
real
distance
when
one
of
the
beacon
stations
checked
in
he
considered
for
some
time
the
possibility
of
sneaking
in
to
one
of
the
contacts
of
which
there
were
many
with
many
more
being
completed
every
week
the
thing
that
stopped
him
was
that
the
success
at
the
proxima
i
to
terra
original
contact
had
established
the
fact
that
the
galactic
network
was
functional
and
now
every
station
along
the
line
that
had
contact
already
made
was
more
than
likely
to
be
visited
regularly
by
various
technicians
for
one
checking
job
or
another
he
would
never
know
just
how
much
time
he
would
have
unmolested
while
he
had
few
qualms
about
working
on
the
stuff
paul
still
felt
a
vague
fear
at
the
idea
of
getting
involved
with
the
bureau
of
astrogation
for
he
was
undoubtedly
a
wanted
man
on
terra
even
if
neoterra
did
not
seem
to
care
with
his
crew
checking
each
of
his
own
stations
paul
took
off
in
his
spacecraft
at
a
speed
just
below
the
speed
of
light
a
beam
went
spearheading
into
space
and
the
velocity
of
paul
ship
created
a
doppler
shift
that
permitted
him
to
receive
the
frequency
as
one
of
the
extremely
long
waves
of
radio
hour
after
hour
he
raced
into
space
checking
both
the
radio
and
the
raced
ahead
of
the
long
finger
of
energy
then
slowed
until
it
caught
up
with
him
suddenly
the
idea
struck
paul
if
he
could
not
safely
remain
in
the
vicinity
of
a
radio
beacon
station
that
had
been
why
could
he
tap
one
end
of
the
radio
beam
while
one
of
his
men
coupled
onto
not
at
but
near
the
other
end
paul
flopped
ends
with
his
ship
and
raced
back
to
beta
iii
twelve
days
later
paul
was
floating
free
a
couple
of
million
miles
above
a
planet
known
only
as
ninth
planet
of
general
star
catalog
number
or
in
bureaucratic
lingo
was
the
star
and
the
planet
was
ix
as
nearly
as
he
could
recall
the
lineup
of
the
galactic
survey
network
ix
had
some
weeks
ago
with
another
star
with
a
catalog
number
some
five
and
a
fraction
light
years
distant
the
beacon
signal
from
the
planet
below
him
roared
in
like
thunder
it
overrode
the
position
of
the
volume
control
enough
to
drive
the
loudspeaker
into
a
blubber
of
noise
somewhere
five
light
years
distant
toby
morrow
one
of
his
men
should
be
waiting
he
might
have
a
bit
of
trouble
finding
the
beacon
with
his
spacecraft
receiver
at
that
distance
noise
was
bothersome
stuff
and
the
nature
of
the
signal
after
crossing
light
years
of
space
was
not
often
high
enough
to
come
in
strong
and
clear
on
anything
but
the
specialized
survey
stations
where
the
input
coils
were
immersed
in
liquid
air
to
cut
the
random
thermal
agitation
of
the
electrons
in
the
wire
paul
watched
the
clock
and
promptly
at
hours
he
snapped
on
the
transmitter
and
receiver
clutched
the
microphone
and
tried
to
think
of
something
heroic
to
say
he
gave
up
trying
to
be
heroic
after
a
few
seconds
and
merely
said
toby
toby
morrow
can
you
hear
me
the
receiver
was
silent
paul
tried
again
and
again
calling
until
his
throat
was
dry
wishing
ruefully
that
he
had
made
a
record
to
play
into
the
transmitter
he
pondered
on
the
uncertainty
angle
he
could
not
be
sure
that
toby
was
observing
the
same
set
of
conditions
as
he
was
since
they
were
separated
in
time
and
space
very
well
separated
by
five
light
years
in
a
universe
that
would
not
permit
gross
matter
to
exceed
the
speed
of
light
but
forced
such
matter
into
a
bubble
of
its
own
type
of
space
it
had
been
demonstrated
that
matter
increases
in
mass
as
its
velocity
rises
and
the
formula
claims
that
the
mass
becomes
infinite
as
the
velocity
of
light
is
reached
but
space
itself
is
warped
by
mass
and
as
the
velocity
rises
toward
the
speed
of
light
the
mass
increases
until
space
is
warped
completely
around
it
creating
a
special
transitory
space
of
its
own
tests
had
been
made
with
timed
supervelocity
missiles
running
toward
an
uninhabited
useless
planet
the
missile
in
its
own
warp
of
space
had
passed
through
the
planet
without
making
any
fuss
or
mark
on
either
the
planet
or
the
missile
then
men
had
tried
it
obviously
matter
occupies
space
but
space
did
no
more
exist
for
real
space
than
otherwise
only
the
law
of
equal
and
opposite
reaction
brought
the
ship
back
to
real
space
once
the
drive
was
cut
the
potential
energy
caused
by
the
warping
of
space
released
once
the
power
was
withdrawn
and
like
a
spring
tightly
wound
and
then
released
the
whole
condition
returned
to
its
original
state
of
inert
stability
paul
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
toby
had
hit
a
snag
somewhere
along
the
line
again
he
thought
of
the
experiments
that
had
been
made
and
smiled
unhappily
he
would
have
liked
to
check
toby
whether
his
watch
was
properly
set
if
his
receiver
was
turned
on
but
once
checked
what
was
to
prevent
toby
from
falling
ill
his
watch
from
running
down
the
blowup
of
some
bit
of
vital
equipment
the
failure
of
something
basic
like
a
power
supply
filter
condenser
or
even
to
prevent
toby
from
turning
off
the
receiver
just
because
the
slight
speaker
hiss
annoyed
the
man
running
continuously
for
better
than
a
week
all
paul
could
do
was
to
keep
on
calling
his
first
attempt
had
been
steady
for
a
half
hour
he
waited
for
a
half
hour
and
then
called
again
toby
toby
morrow
can
you
hear
me
paul
went
into
a
ramble
of
talk
just
to
keep
the
circuit
alive
he
recited
poetry
discussed
physics
and
finally
he
broke
into
song
and
round
and
round
go
the
deuterons
round
and
round
the
magnet
swings
round
and
round
and
round
go
the
deutrons
look
at
those
neutrons
pouring
out
there
then
the
chattered
into
life
paul
jumped
with
excitement
and
reached
for
the
volume
control
to
bring
the
roar
of
voice
down
to
a
recognizable
level
that
a
lousy
program
we
got
well
turn
it
off
better
we
should
shut
the
station
off
hey
this
is
paul
grayson
we
know
who
it
is
came
the
sharp
reply
at
the
same
instant
a
powerful
light
flashed
into
the
viewport
and
paul
looked
to
see
a
spacer
bearing
down
on
him
as
he
watched
there
was
a
flash
of
orange
flame
at
the
nose
he
did
not
see
the
shell
but
whether
it
was
one
of
the
standard
solid
rounds
used
to
check
whether
a
planet
or
meteor
were
contraterrene
or
whether
it
was
loaded
with
high
explosives
a
projectile
is
nothing
to
be
hit
with
in
space
his
hand
reached
for
the
high
drive
paul
could
outrun
any
projectile
that
way
once
his
ship
got
started
but
another
spacecraft
passed
at
his
side
close
enough
to
count
the
rivets
and
as
it
passed
him
it
began
strewing
space
with
a
myriad
of
baseball
sized
chunks
of
solid
matter
to
start
the
high
drive
now
would
be
death
in
a
matter
of
seconds
the
first
few
would
be
pushed
aside
the
next
batch
would
ricochet
from
his
hull
the
batch
he
met
just
before
he
reached
the
velocity
would
come
through
like
a
shotgun
blast
shattering
a
brick
of
cheese
turn
off
the
came
the
command
turn
it
off
or
the
next
shot
will
drill
dead
center
paul
hesitated
another
flare
came
from
the
oncoming
ship
and
the
shell
drilled
deep
into
paul
spacecraft
among
the
machinery
and
stores
bulkhead
doors
clanged
shut
the
whistle
of
air
rose
and
then
fell
as
some
compartment
or
other
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
ship
blasted
its
air
out
through
a
jagged
hole
in
the
hull
next
one
will
be
through
your
department
paul
shrugged
unhappily
and
snapped
the
toggle
switch
on
the
transmitter
the
other
ship
came
alongside
threw
out
magnetic
grapples
and
then
they
came
aboard
in
space
suits
through
the
airlock
they
waved
him
aside
and
took
over
the
controls
of
his
ship
stolidly
and
silently
they
drove
him
toward
ix
landed
him
on
a
crude
spaceport
and
escorted
him
to
a
new
building
where
he
faced
a
man
who
chewed
a
cold
cigar
and
eyed
him
with
a
great
amount
of
pleasure
well
look
who
here
he
gibed
what
of
it
snapped
paul
lucky
us
to
think
that
of
all
the
stars
in
the
galaxy
paul
grayson
would
fasten
his
eye
on
us
my
friend
you
have
no
idea
what
a
shock
that
gave
us
we
broke
three
necks
getting
out
there
before
you
could
do
some
harm
so
you
caught
me
but
catching
me
is
going
to
stop
progress
how
vitally
correct
you
are
you
pardon
me
i
am
called
westlake
i
am
what
is
known
as
a
henchman
hireling
or
employee
of
people
who
prefer
to
see
the
communications
stalled
how
long
can
you
prevent
it
long
enough
said
westlake
after
that
it
can
start
with
a
big
bang
it
would
be
helpful
you
are
going
to
get
away
with
this
you
know
who
me
i
bet
i
do
just
wait
and
see
i
do
admit
that
communications
would
be
helpful
for
instance
if
we
had
contact
with
neoterra
i
could
find
out
what
happened
between
the
last
information
i
got
which
came
from
terra
and
your
subsequent
arrival
here
last
dope
i
had
was
your
capture
and
transmittal
to
neoterra
where
some
plan
was
being
cooked
up
for
you
now
confound
it
got
a
few
months
to
wait
between
my
telling
the
folks
back
home
that
i
collected
you
and
what
do
they
want
me
to
do
about
it
another
angle
grayson
is
that
if
we
had
networks
i
could
be
sure
that
our
friends
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
were
as
quick
as
we
were
if
we
knew
that
westlake
paused
and
then
laughed
hell
if
we
had
networks
running
i
would
have
been
the
happiest
guy
in
the
galaxy
to
catch
you
you
one
of
hoagland
gang
that
as
good
a
guess
as
any
then
suppose
you
tell
me
where
stacey
and
nora
phillips
are
oh
i
do
mind
they
came
with
the
first
line
of
information
about
you
in
fact
i
have
you
meet
them
they
let
you
in
on
a
lot
of
things
about
this
place
which
will
save
me
a
lot
of
time
burroughs
burroughs
burroughs
see
that
grayson
gets
to
talk
to
john
stacey
and
nora
phillips
in
the
closed
conference
room
right
stacey
came
first
he
looked
nodded
and
said
i
was
wondering
when
you
show
up
i
here
but
about
you
so
very
simple
the
rooker
rooked
the
seeker
sucked
in
it
a
long
time
ago
paul
but
do
you
remember
when
i
called
you
just
before
you
went
to
lecture
yes
you
been
to
the
house
on
bridge
street
i
left
the
upright
coffin
labelled
booth
and
walked
right
between
two
large
determined
characters
who
insisted
that
i
continue
walking
in
their
direction
i
gathered
from
their
conversation
that
someone
responsible
for
their
movements
was
irked
at
one
paul
grayson
and
anger
at
grayson
included
anybody
else
who
had
been
seen
talking
to
him
for
the
past
eight
years
i
was
then
bundled
aboard
a
spacecraft
and
brought
here
when
did
you
miss
me
that
all
you
know
the
oberspinnenführer
is
not
exactly
loquacious
nor
am
i
an
honored
guest
to
be
greeted
with
shouts
and
glee
these
spiders
close
their
trap
doors
when
i
am
around
oh
then
you
did
know
that
a
couple
of
burly
policemen
arrested
me
for
your
murder
they
did
blinked
stacey
what
did
they
use
for
corpus
delectable
they
did
have
to
they
were
probably
the
same
pair
of
large
determined
gents
that
corralled
you
this
time
they
were
dressed
in
clothing
that
belonged
to
a
couple
of
real
cops
and
from
there
where
i
was
hauled
off
to
harrigan
horror
where
in
the
name
of
planet
near
to
neosol
next
survey
link
station
from
neoterra
i
was
to
be
used
as
a
decoy
or
something
paul
went
on
to
explain
the
one
thing
that
did
occur
to
me
along
the
trip
to
neosol
was
that
if
these
guys
would
lie
about
their
status
there
was
no
reason
to
expect
the
truth
about
you
nora
now
she
was
here
when
i
arrived
under
lock
and
key
she
is
quite
a
dish
of
tea
old
man
the
door
opened
again
to
let
nora
phillips
come
in
paul
had
been
right
in
his
appraisal
of
the
woman
imperfections
in
her
dress
or
did
not
lessen
her
appeal
she
had
been
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
without
a
hairdresser
her
clothing
was
crude
and
cheap
not
a
trace
of
cosmetic
was
on
her
face
the
light
in
her
eye
was
dulled
and
her
litheness
had
become
apathetic
month
after
month
of
hopeless
waiting
had
taken
the
ambition
out
of
her
but
she
was
nora
phillips
nonetheless
paul
went
to
her
and
put
his
arms
around
her
she
looked
up
at
him
quietly
and
then
put
her
head
down
on
his
shoulder
she
did
not
cry
she
did
not
have
to
cry
she
relaxed
against
him
and
let
him
hold
her
letting
paul
give
her
some
of
his
strength
it
was
a
futile
thing
paul
felt
that
he
had
no
real
comfort
to
offer
in
fact
he
was
in
just
as
bad
a
position
as
she
was
his
hand
stroked
her
head
and
she
moved
slightly
wriggling
close
to
him
stacey
coughed
slightly
i
hate
to
bust
this
up
he
said
softly
and
maybe
i
should
because
you
may
not
get
another
chance
but
now
after
a
year
and
a
half
maybe
we
all
could
learn
something
about
what
the
hell
is
going
on
at
least
tell
me
paul
tightened
his
grip
on
nora
for
a
moment
holding
her
close
raising
her
face
he
kissed
her
gently
before
he
moved
to
sit
across
the
conference
table
from
john
stacey
do
you
know
anything
about
it
i
did
mention
a
slight
reticence
a
certain
lack
of
volubility
on
the
part
of
mine
host
this
said
stacey
pointedly
is
the
first
time
i
seen
nora
phillips
close
enough
to
let
someone
else
touch
her
careful
said
paul
this
place
is
wired
for
sound
no
doubt
we
not
telling
anything
that
the
management
does
not
know
said
stacey
and
if
we
are
they
not
interrupt
go
on
nora
give
remember
i
the
detective
in
the
novels
i
the
guy
who
knows
all
the
answers
forms
the
decisions
finds
the
clues
and
solves
the
case
just
furnish
me
with
one
answer
one
clue
one
decision
and
one
solution
and
we
have
professor
moriarity
in
gaol
by
morning
nora
frowned
at
stacey
you
take
this
lightly
i
shall
as
soon
as
i
can
get
some
bedeck
me
out
in
sackcloth
paul
who
knew
stacey
manner
shook
his
head
at
nora
he
pressed
her
hand
a
moment
and
then
said
nora
some
people
get
mad
at
the
milkman
and
then
take
out
their
mad
at
everybody
else
they
meet
for
a
week
the
other
extreme
is
stacey
who
has
the
viewpoint
that
he
and
we
are
still
alive
i
that
way
nodded
stacey
no
one
ever
got
anywhere
by
yelling
about
the
bum
deal
they
got
it
the
guy
who
puts
his
head
down
and
shoves
and
the
bird
that
gets
mad
at
the
universe
because
some
bum
stepped
on
his
foot
in
the
subway
is
the
guy
who
loses
a
lot
of
friends
i
forget
it
and
tell
us
suggested
stacey
this
is
a
political
battle
said
nora
then
she
went
on
to
explain
as
huston
had
explained
to
paul
when
she
finished
paul
smiled
knowingly
what
she
asked
him
hoagland
gang
bumped
off
the
guy
that
clipped
me
because
he
flopped
but
on
proxima
there
was
another
guy
made
up
to
resemble
me
and
he
was
clipped
by
someone
else
paul
looked
at
nora
probably
the
same
guy
that
so
conveniently
provided
a
recording
of
your
voice
to
convince
me
that
i
solved
the
problem
of
transmission
he
said
sharply
nora
shrugged
that
was
ed
link
she
said
simply
what
happened
someone
dropped
what
looked
like
a
meteor
shower
on
the
bird
that
sounds
like
link
idea
of
handling
it
she
said
but
the
deceased
asked
stacey
upon
whose
side
was
he
aligned
not
on
hoagland
certainly
not
on
huston
nora
tell
me
why
did
you
make
that
false
recording
nora
looked
at
paul
and
then
pulled
him
to
her
and
hugged
his
head
against
her
cheek
for
a
moment
paul
as
a
scientist
you
understand
the
man
on
the
street
we
wanted
something
to
show
neoterra
you
do
understand
this
but
paul
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
gotten
away
with
it
but
i
did
not
just
pretend
set
up
a
hypothesis
for
a
minute
suppose
that
you
had
been
able
to
convince
the
terran
physical
society
that
you
had
received
from
terra
while
you
were
on
proxima
i
i
have
been
the
man
of
the
hour
i
have
been
handed
a
large
appropriation
and
a
project
of
my
own
to
pursue
this
but
nora
it
will
work
why
did
you
feel
that
you
had
to
falsify
paul
you
are
the
only
man
in
the
known
universe
that
does
not
think
haedaecker
theory
is
valid
please
go
on
please
so
i
have
been
able
to
pursue
my
work
unhampered
and
now
suppose
that
you
were
unable
to
make
the
contact
again
suggested
nora
remember
the
recording
was
the
only
contact
but
the
regardless
of
your
belief
does
not
really
work
paul
shrugged
lacking
a
repeat
i
have
begun
to
study
the
connection
a
bit
more
he
said
so
the
upshot
would
have
been
for
those
who
wanted
communications
between
terra
and
neoterra
stacey
looked
wistful
quoting
some
great
poet
that
i
do
remember
other
than
that
it
was
not
edgar
guest
or
john
paul
jones
all
sad
words
of
tongue
or
pen
the
saddest
are
these
it
might
have
been
so
what
do
we
do
now
paul
looked
at
stacey
this
is
ix
hoagland
gang
have
equipment
here
probably
trying
to
see
whether
or
not
i
am
right
so
the
thing
to
do
is
to
get
free
long
enough
to
use
the
equipment
for
a
call
for
help
nora
shook
her
head
paul
looked
at
stacey
stacey
looked
at
nora
and
said
i
do
know
anything
about
it
paul
looked
at
nora
do
you
believe
either
nora
clung
to
him
hugged
him
to
her
cradled
his
head
against
her
soft
breasts
and
caressed
his
cheek
paul
paul
paul
i
do
so
desperately
to
believe
i
want
you
to
be
everything
i
want
you
paul
relaxed
in
her
arms
for
a
moment
then
moved
away
from
her
holding
her
by
the
shoulders
and
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
he
said
but
nora
buried
her
face
in
his
shoulder
a
sob
wrenched
her
and
she
clutched
at
him
frantically
then
she
looked
up
with
tears
welling
on
the
brim
of
her
eyes
tried
to
speak
but
choked
and
buried
her
head
in
his
shoulder
once
more
paul
put
his
hand
under
her
chin
lifted
it
from
his
shoulder
and
with
his
other
hand
dashed
the
tears
from
nora
eyes
tell
me
he
said
gently
paul
paul
oh
paul
i
love
you
and
this
hurts
but
for
all
of
your
faith
you
have
not
one
shred
of
evidence
chapter
like
most
human
beings
paul
could
comprehend
the
actions
of
someone
of
his
own
type
but
he
could
not
understand
the
mental
machinations
of
people
who
had
other
motives
and
other
interests
in
life
nor
could
he
seem
to
make
other
people
understand
that
his
continued
interest
in
the
was
only
just
and
sensible
after
all
he
had
never
had
an
opportunity
to
try
it
to
paul
it
was
just
that
simple
just
let
him
try
it
he
had
so
much
faith
in
it
that
he
could
not
foresee
his
next
reaction
if
failure
came
paul
did
not
consider
failure
as
a
possibility
but
if
he
did
fail
he
would
automatically
begin
insisting
upon
a
chance
to
continue
insisting
that
something
had
gone
awry
or
that
there
were
factors
that
must
be
studied
this
sort
of
attitude
was
acceptable
to
paul
yet
he
could
not
comprehend
the
contemplated
action
of
the
political
factions
he
was
involved
with
for
instance
one
faction
was
going
to
falsify
evidence
in
order
to
swing
an
election
this
seemed
dishonest
to
paul
he
wondered
just
how
they
could
justify
their
act
the
other
faction
was
keeping
him
prisoner
so
that
he
could
not
furnish
any
evidence
at
all
but
eventually
one
side
or
the
other
was
going
to
find
that
its
evidence
was
in
error
then
what
supposing
because
he
had
been
kidnaped
by
this
particular
gang
and
thus
gave
some
concrete
evidence
of
negative
result
hoagland
and
westlake
and
the
rest
were
elected
after
which
the
contact
proved
good
or
if
huston
and
his
crowd
got
elected
on
the
strength
of
the
contact
and
then
because
paul
was
captive
and
unable
to
make
it
work
there
was
no
communication
with
terra
how
could
they
justify
their
claims
in
the
face
of
the
emptiness
of
their
prophecies
paul
could
not
understand
the
political
mind
and
the
thinking
of
the
man
on
the
street
he
could
not
even
apply
such
thinking
to
his
own
case
the
fact
that
for
eons
politicians
have
been
making
promises
that
were
unfulfilled
after
election
did
not
register
with
grayson
the
thing
to
do
of
course
was
to
escape
then
he
could
work
and
bring
out
the
truth
which
to
paul
was
and
positive
and
thus
do
away
with
all
of
the
lies
and
statements
but
how
he
had
to
admit
that
he
was
not
he
believed
that
both
sides
were
willing
to
have
contact
with
terra
for
commercial
reasons
but
he
knew
that
only
one
side
wanted
communications
now
ergo
the
opposing
side
which
were
his
captors
would
treat
him
well
in
the
hope
of
having
him
work
for
them
once
the
election
was
over
paul
shrugged
whatever
the
cause
he
would
not
cut
off
his
nose
to
spite
his
face
his
was
no
interest
in
political
fray
he
wanted
to
work
with
the
in
fact
westlake
and
hoagland
had
one
facet
that
looked
reasonably
good
their
party
was
for
autonomy
and
if
paul
worked
for
them
he
would
be
forever
free
of
any
legal
attachment
to
terra
and
doubtless
haedaecker
and
the
whole
bureau
of
astrogation
were
out
gunning
for
paul
grayson
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
stolen
burast
were
huston
and
his
coalition
government
to
get
in
haedaecker
could
swing
a
large
club
over
the
various
integrated
wings
of
government
and
make
paul
life
precarious
so
paul
was
on
the
fence
so
far
as
his
work
was
concerned
in
fact
at
the
present
moment
paul
did
not
think
highly
of
either
political
ambition
since
their
high
ambition
was
tarred
with
a
wide
full
brush
of
downright
thuggery
escape
of
course
was
an
easy
word
to
say
it
was
true
that
incarceration
was
nothing
like
being
cooped
up
in
a
jail
cell
his
door
was
closed
but
not
locked
he
had
plenty
of
time
and
opportunity
to
see
and
talk
to
both
nora
and
john
stacey
and
to
make
friends
with
other
political
prisoners
across
the
broad
plain
was
a
spaceport
and
some
spacecraft
that
came
and
went
but
going
there
and
taking
off
presented
the
problem
of
getting
away
with
it
he
was
somewhat
reminded
of
the
signs
reputed
to
be
placed
around
the
penal
grounds
on
antarctica
there
were
maps
of
the
south
polar
region
of
terra
with
latitude
longitude
and
the
distance
in
miles
from
the
penitentiary
to
the
nearest
shred
of
civilization
carefully
and
accurately
marked
listed
below
the
maps
was
a
roster
of
average
temperatures
for
the
district
at
any
time
of
the
year
and
the
whole
thing
was
a
great
deterrent
to
walking
out
of
the
place
and
trying
to
cross
a
few
thousand
miles
of
very
cold
nothing
in
order
to
get
to
one
of
civilization
southern
outposts
where
the
escapee
name
would
be
posted
long
before
he
could
arrive
the
only
way
a
man
could
escape
was
to
have
some
means
of
communication
so
that
friends
could
come
to
his
aid
paul
only
method
of
contact
was
the
they
did
let
paul
tinker
and
they
even
let
him
work
but
they
would
not
let
him
near
equipment
that
was
connected
with
the
radio
beacon
toby
morrow
helped
paul
with
calculations
and
theory
being
the
only
one
among
the
prisoners
who
had
done
any
work
with
grayson
morrow
of
course
had
been
picked
up
by
westlake
crew
on
the
planet
at
the
other
end
of
this
leg
of
the
galactic
survey
link
along
about
the
same
time
that
paul
had
been
grabbed
near
ix
it
was
apparent
without
saying
anything
about
it
that
westlake
gang
had
been
working
with
the
in
the
hope
of
establishing
the
validity
of
paul
statements
but
so
far
they
had
not
been
able
to
make
contact
apparently
and
paul
had
not
been
able
to
either
so
as
the
days
passed
into
weeks
paul
once
more
reconstructed
his
map
of
the
galactic
survey
and
connected
this
star
with
that
and
the
other
with
the
fourth
it
was
beginning
to
fill
in
now
paul
viewed
it
with
interest
occasionally
wondering
who
was
checking
the
beacons
in
his
place
but
it
was
filling
in
and
it
reminded
him
somewhat
of
that
game
played
with
dots
in
which
each
player
takes
a
turn
connecting
two
dots
with
a
line
the
idea
being
to
complete
squares
yourself
while
preventing
your
opponent
from
completing
any
usually
the
first
several
moves
are
drawn
here
and
there
with
no
particular
pattern
then
as
the
game
progresses
more
and
more
lines
connect
more
and
more
dots
until
it
is
impossible
to
draw
a
line
between
two
dots
that
does
not
also
connect
two
other
previously
drawn
lines
the
galactic
map
is
far
from
a
square
otherwise
all
of
the
lines
would
have
terminated
at
the
same
time
even
so
there
were
whole
lengths
of
solid
line
across
space
between
the
nearer
stars
that
would
make
a
solid
connection
between
stations
thirty
to
fifty
light
years
apart
and
every
week
saw
another
connection
made
and
each
connection
completed
the
connection
between
isolated
groups
it
took
on
a
appearance
paul
thought
that
if
it
were
stretched
out
and
the
collateral
paths
were
added
the
thing
would
have
reached
between
terra
and
neoterra
and
back
so
paul
added
to
his
map
as
the
weeks
went
on
until
there
were
only
a
few
open
stretches
between
sol
and
neosol
he
thought
ruefully
that
it
was
a
damned
shame
that
the
whole
galactic
network
would
be
completely
closed
before
he
got
a
chance
to
try
the
instead
of
starting
with
one
contact
and
working
his
way
across
the
first
interstellar
contact
via
might
well
be
a
complete
attempt
between
the
two
planets
one
hundred
and
forty
light
years
apart
it
was
a
curious
proposition
civilization
had
been
geared
to
a
constantly
accelerating
life
up
to
the
time
that
mother
earth
and
her
daughter
colony
obtained
and
found
that
they
were
irrevocably
separated
in
time
and
space
by
about
ten
months
and
one
hundred
forty
light
years
fast
spacecraft
could
hiss
through
the
distance
as
message
couriers
in
about
eight
months
but
the
power
needed
for
such
ships
reduced
the
payload
but
letters
were
the
best
means
of
communication
for
a
business
man
would
be
out
of
touch
for
at
least
twenty
months
if
he
went
himself
so
mankind
struggled
along
as
best
it
could
hoping
that
someday
someone
would
be
able
to
lick
the
problem
even
paul
group
was
able
to
witness
the
regular
arrival
and
departure
of
couriers
and
men
who
came
on
official
business
when
one
of
the
faster
ships
brought
hoagland
himself
none
of
the
prisoners
gave
any
special
attention
to
his
arrival
hoagland
told
to
westlake
that
was
a
sharp
job
westlake
i
thought
so
but
your
report
forgot
to
mention
one
item
you
did
state
that
grayson
was
trying
to
tap
the
radio
beacon
from
a
couple
of
million
miles
out
and
that
you
caught
him
and
his
partner
on
the
other
end
of
the
beam
but
you
forgot
to
mention
whether
your
own
experiments
were
successful
westlake
laughed
only
in
catching
grayson
and
morrow
that
was
coincidence
of
the
upper
brackets
hoagland
smiled
that
it
was
he
said
but
have
you
gotten
any
evidence
none
we
been
trying
grayson
idea
for
months
without
success
when
the
broke
into
life
we
thought
it
was
working
until
we
located
the
source
and
went
out
to
pick
him
up
the
boys
at
the
other
end
heard
the
same
thing
did
likewise
and
then
came
scurrying
back
home
to
let
me
know
about
it
so
we
collected
grayson
and
morrow
in
two
fell
swoops
hoagland
nodded
again
and
then
said
westlake
how
good
a
gambler
are
you
i
like
to
play
safe
said
westlake
how
safe
plenty
then
you
wo
like
this
but
i
going
to
make
one
gamble
and
one
bet
on
a
certain
thing
yes
and
which
is
which
without
a
doubt
grayson
got
the
equipment
he
was
using
from
huston
and
huston
crowd
of
coalitionists
they
set
him
up
on
some
planet
with
a
laboratory
under
their
direction
and
are
probably
running
the
neoterran
press
ragged
with
glowing
reports
of
grayson
howling
success
carefully
guarding
their
statements
with
cautious
warnings
that
the
public
must
not
expect
communications
with
terra
overnight
but
someday
soon
and
so
forth
westlake
laughed
police
anticipate
an
early
apprehension
of
the
criminals
sort
of
thing
exactly
furthermore
i
will
be
a
bad
prophet
if
i
am
incorrect
in
assuming
that
when
huston
started
grayson
on
his
job
huston
gave
orders
that
grayson
was
not
to
do
anything
that
would
gain
him
any
notice
whatsoever
on
the
idea
that
the
first
mention
of
failure
would
puncture
political
propaganda
all
reasoning
based
upon
the
would
i
do
theory
good
and
sound
i
calls
it
right
now
here
is
the
certainty
if
grayson
is
the
kind
of
idealist
that
i
think
he
is
grayson
will
at
the
first
opportunity
make
some
check
of
the
in
fact
he
has
tried
to
set
it
up
already
he
will
try
again
if
he
is
permitted
that
your
certainty
now
for
the
gamble
i
read
all
of
haedaecker
theory
and
find
it
solid
i
read
grayson
line
of
reasoning
and
find
it
logical
then
which
is
right
haedaecker
based
his
reasoning
on
fact
grayson
set
out
to
poke
holes
in
it
and
like
so
many
idealists
he
proceeded
to
leap
upon
any
facet
that
supported
his
theory
against
haedaecker
while
discounting
anything
that
mitigated
against
him
so
smiled
hoagland
affably
the
thing
to
do
is
to
permit
mister
grayson
escape
in
a
ship
loaded
with
gear
let
him
take
his
friends
phillips
stacey
and
morrow
westlake
nodded
slowly
i
get
it
grayson
will
not
make
his
next
attempt
in
secret
he
try
it
and
we
have
observers
to
watch
and
report
his
failure
right
not
much
later
hoagland
ship
took
off
for
neoterra
another
ship
took
off
for
terra
with
messages
out
across
the
broad
plain
paul
could
see
from
his
window
that
the
only
ship
remaining
on
the
rough
spaceport
was
his
own
spacecraft
the
one
furnished
by
huston
little
job
had
been
taken
off
somewhere
paul
shook
his
head
unhappily
someone
was
willing
to
pour
a
lot
of
money
into
this
business
spacecraft
were
expensive
yet
they
were
being
bandied
about
and
traded
like
horses
in
a
rustler
camp
while
all
paul
needed
was
entry
to
that
one
spacecraft
over
there
plus
about
ten
minutes
of
free
time
grayson
paced
his
room
until
dark
muttering
and
grunting
unhappily
time
and
again
he
returned
to
the
window
to
look
longingly
at
his
spacecraft
and
time
and
again
he
wondered
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
steal
out
across
that
mile
or
so
of
sheer
flat
plain
and
get
into
the
ship
without
being
seen
in
broad
daylight
it
would
be
impossible
but
the
encampment
was
somewhat
south
of
the
polar
region
where
the
big
beacon
station
was
situated
and
the
planet
was
progressing
along
in
its
year
so
that
very
soon
the
beacon
station
would
be
entering
the
of
night
the
encampment
had
been
in
perpetual
daylight
a
of
the
midnight
sun
latitude
but
now
there
was
a
short
night
beginning
which
would
lengthen
as
the
year
progressed
it
was
dark
dark
paul
looked
out
of
his
room
the
corridor
was
dark
deliberately
paul
stood
there
with
the
door
open
waiting
he
had
gone
out
before
but
had
not
gone
far
before
someone
came
sauntering
by
to
engage
him
in
conversation
pleasant
conversation
that
carefully
avoided
mention
of
the
fact
that
this
talk
was
between
jailer
and
prisoner
and
that
one
was
keeping
an
eye
on
the
other
paul
sauntered
down
toward
toby
morrow
room
the
door
was
open
and
toby
was
fiddling
with
something
at
the
top
inner
corner
of
the
jamb
what
gives
asked
grayson
toby
jumped
like
a
startled
doe
settled
down
as
he
saw
paul
and
then
took
a
deep
breath
do
scare
a
man
that
way
he
complained
he
took
another
deep
breath
i
just
discovered
the
burglar
alarm
he
chuckled
and
fixed
it
from
here
morrow
waved
at
the
open
door
been
open
for
an
hour
nobody
came
thought
you
were
it
paul
grayson
smiled
i
doubt
that
you
did
much
toby
something
blown
out
somewhere
i
got
out
without
fixing
my
door
and
no
one
came
for
me
either
morrow
nodded
thoughtfully
most
alarms
are
designed
so
that
any
tinkering
with
them
will
result
in
sending
the
alarm
he
muttered
propositions
i
just
located
the
contactor
on
my
door
and
was
jamming
it
shut
that
would
take
care
of
my
door
but
not
yours
now
let
see
what
could
be
wrong
paul
grunted
let
not
waste
time
in
figuring
out
what
wrong
with
the
enemy
burglar
alarm
he
said
this
is
no
time
to
be
overly
helpful
you
go
collect
john
stacey
and
i
find
nora
phillips
and
we
meet
down
in
the
front
hallway
what
gives
sitting
here
like
a
fool
does
make
me
happy
i
want
action
why
do
we
try
to
get
away
toby
what
can
we
lose
nothing
but
some
breath
okay
it
a
deal
paul
went
down
the
stairs
cautiously
along
the
corridor
below
until
he
came
to
nora
room
and
then
without
rapping
he
opened
the
door
and
stole
in
closing
the
door
behind
him
paul
she
cried
what
collect
yourself
grinned
paul
we
leaving
he
did
not
think
until
much
later
that
he
had
not
bothered
to
knock
nor
had
he
apologized
for
bursting
in
this
way
it
had
come
as
a
natural
way
a
normal
thing
modesty
propriety
and
convention
were
only
words
and
totally
useless
commodities
when
escape
from
imprisonment
looked
possible
and
it
was
also
much
later
before
paul
realized
that
nora
must
have
agreed
with
him
for
she
wasted
no
time
in
the
darkened
room
there
was
a
wild
flurry
of
arms
legs
and
clothing
a
nightgown
dropped
carelessly
on
the
floor
and
trampled
as
nora
slid
a
dress
over
her
head
and
at
the
same
time
tried
to
fumble
her
feet
into
her
shoes
there
was
the
whisk
of
a
hand
smoothing
cloth
over
skin
and
then
a
quick
step
nora
bumped
into
paul
and
clutched
at
him
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
held
her
for
a
moment
enjoying
the
warm
softness
of
her
against
him
then
he
turned
away
and
led
her
to
the
door
they
met
stacey
and
morrow
in
the
downstairs
hall
okay
he
asked
in
a
hoarse
whisper
looks
so
said
morrow
i
do
like
it
said
stacey
why
looks
too
easy
do
be
so
everlastingly
suspicious
said
nora
oh
i
not
the
type
to
admire
the
denture
of
a
gift
horse
responded
stacey
not
until
later
so
let
get
going
paul
opened
the
door
this
is
it
he
snapped
run
for
it
wait
a
minute
objected
stacey
not
straight
head
left
you
two
we
go
right
cut
a
large
circle
and
do
run
just
walk
as
fast
as
you
can
and
be
as
quiet
as
you
can
it
as
dark
as
the
devil
hip
pocket
out
there
but
sooner
or
later
someone
will
realize
that
all
is
not
well
with
the
boys
at
home
now
now
they
separated
outside
compared
to
the
lights
in
the
hallways
of
the
house
paul
and
nora
picked
their
way
carefully
until
their
eyes
became
adjusted
to
the
dark
then
they
could
see
the
dim
lights
of
the
buildings
across
the
plain
they
left
their
former
home
and
swung
wide
angling
away
from
the
line
between
the
house
and
the
ship
paul
paused
once
listening
and
heard
a
faint
crackle
from
some
distance
either
morrow
or
stacey
had
stumbled
over
something
they
were
there
before
any
was
raised
each
pair
had
gone
out
in
a
course
until
house
and
spaceship
were
almost
a
angle
apart
paul
wondered
they
were
far
from
the
house
it
was
true
but
they
were
almost
as
far
from
the
spacecraft
now
as
they
had
been
when
standing
on
the
front
steps
of
the
house
his
mathematical
mind
made
a
quick
computation
and
he
smiled
audibly
chuckling
what
said
nora
in
a
low
voice
i
was
just
thinking
that
we
are
now
point
seven
zero
seven
of
the
original
distance
from
the
spaceship
nora
laughed
gently
some
man
she
said
has
no
time
to
kiss
me
in
my
room
but
has
time
to
play
trigonometry
here
paul
patted
her
gently
trig
is
something
i
can
do
without
putting
all
i
got
into
it
no
from
a
distance
there
came
the
faint
ringing
of
a
bell
nice
man
said
nora
i
forgive
you
until
later
lights
went
on
across
the
plain
men
stormed
out
of
the
big
building
and
leaped
into
a
parked
on
the
road
in
front
of
it
the
command
car
roared
into
life
and
started
across
the
plain
toward
the
dormitory
now
said
paul
down
they
hit
the
dirt
side
by
side
as
the
headlights
swung
around
then
the
beams
of
light
were
gone
and
nora
and
paul
were
upright
once
more
and
running
noise
meant
nothing
in
face
of
the
roar
from
the
jeep
engine
the
car
was
careening
across
the
plain
madly
and
paul
knew
that
no
one
aboard
the
car
would
be
able
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
any
running
figures
about
all
they
could
do
was
to
hang
onto
the
racketing
jeep
the
spacecraft
loomed
larger
before
them
the
roar
of
the
jeep
died
as
the
car
reached
the
dormitory
and
paul
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
to
watch
the
men
pile
out
of
the
car
and
head
into
the
building
on
a
dead
run
faster
he
breathed
the
ship
was
a
hundred
yards
away
and
paul
could
see
stacey
and
morrow
running
in
from
the
other
side
when
there
was
the
roar
of
the
engine
again
the
headlights
swung
around
to
catch
them
but
this
time
they
did
not
care
it
was
run
for
it
no
time
to
play
cat
and
mouse
the
engine
whined
high
paul
put
on
more
speed
running
away
from
nora
paul
come
on
he
snapped
over
his
shoulder
do
talk
run
he
raced
away
from
her
outdistanced
her
the
jeep
roar
coming
louder
and
louder
paul
reached
the
spacelock
and
fumbled
with
the
outside
controls
ponderously
the
lock
opened
swinging
aside
just
as
stacey
and
morrow
came
panting
up
in
snapped
paul
then
he
turned
caught
nora
hand
and
hurled
her
headlong
through
the
opening
he
leaped
in
after
her
tripped
over
her
sprawling
ankle
caught
the
flipper
switch
to
the
door
as
he
fell
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
as
the
spacelock
door
started
to
close
the
roar
of
the
engine
still
came
through
the
closing
slit
a
shot
pinged
against
the
steel
hull
paul
forgot
about
the
spacelock
and
headed
up
the
runway
to
the
control
room
he
hit
the
control
panel
with
both
hands
flipped
the
switch
and
the
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
a
ragged
with
the
ship
rising
as
the
driving
generators
warmed
up
instead
of
taking
off
with
a
hot
drive
he
waited
with
one
hand
on
the
high
drive
switch
waited
and
waited
and
waited
another
shot
pinged
against
the
hull
one
glanced
from
the
but
it
was
at
such
an
angle
that
it
merely
nicked
the
glass
but
did
not
crack
it
it
sang
off
high
into
the
air
stacey
and
morrow
came
into
the
control
room
panting
and
nora
between
them
what
are
we
waiting
for
snapped
stacey
getting
up
steam
what
is
this
a
stanley
steamer
just
takes
as
long
grunted
paul
then
the
low
drive
took
hold
the
ship
lifted
uncertainly
awkwardly
quaveringly
and
slowly
not
the
quick
of
the
ship
but
as
the
seconds
passed
the
ship
steadied
the
controls
got
less
mushy
and
the
drive
became
more
certain
a
light
flashed
in
through
the
port
their
erstwhile
jailers
had
aimed
a
spotlight
on
the
ship
and
with
the
light
there
came
the
pattering
of
gunshot
a
flat
bark
came
from
below
and
paul
braced
himself
for
the
impact
that
did
not
come
a
miss
then
he
snapped
the
high
drive
and
the
floor
leaped
upward
under
them
chair
cushions
flattened
and
then
filled
out
again
as
the
hydraulic
compensators
went
to
work
behind
them
the
planet
diminished
in
size
visibly
and
then
at
once
the
viewport
just
became
black
and
featureless
outside
paul
leaned
back
in
the
pilot
chair
wow
he
yelped
made
it
said
stacey
paul
got
up
and
went
over
to
nora
i
was
running
away
from
you
he
said
plaintively
it
takes
time
to
get
the
door
open
i
forgive
you
said
nora
with
a
smile
back
below
them
westlake
said
you
sure
you
missed
i
a
master
gunner
said
the
other
it
takes
a
good
gunner
to
miss
a
ship
that
big
when
it
is
that
close
i
missed
all
right
westlake
smiled
we
sure
made
that
look
good
but
god
what
a
job
of
timing
i
thought
we
were
going
to
have
to
blow
out
a
tire
to
keep
from
catching
them
chapter
once
in
space
and
safely
away
paul
gloated
that
the
former
captors
were
without
spacecraft
now
he
stopped
the
flight
of
the
ship
and
spent
a
couple
of
hours
making
some
the
return
to
latham
triplets
was
jerky
because
he
was
uncertain
of
the
distance
and
so
they
made
it
in
five
approximations
ending
up
finally
with
only
a
few
hours
to
go
for
landing
paul
first
interest
was
his
laboratory
there
had
been
plenty
of
time
for
the
hookup
to
be
established
and
for
all
he
knew
the
boys
he
had
set
to
checking
it
might
have
completed
the
connection
proved
in
the
and
gone
home
to
neoterra
with
the
glad
news
in
their
hands
he
entered
the
laboratory
on
latham
beta
iii
and
his
face
fell
dust
covered
the
equipment
the
pilot
lamps
were
out
and
obviously
nothing
had
been
done
for
weeks
if
not
months
it
was
untenanted
and
untended
paul
went
to
the
supervisor
of
the
botanical
set
up
i
do
know
he
said
with
a
certain
disinterest
your
boys
fooled
around
for
a
couple
of
weeks
after
you
left
and
then
decided
that
gone
for
good
they
might
have
sent
word
back
to
neoterra
but
it
seemed
a
better
idea
to
pick
up
and
go
home
so
they
did
paul
went
back
to
the
laboratory
nora
said
paul
let
go
to
neoterra
why
i
want
huston
to
know
i
all
right
paul
looked
at
her
blankly
they
might
have
left
the
radio
beacons
on
he
mumbled
what
he
told
her
again
but
we
best
get
to
neoterra
paul
shook
his
head
nora
latham
triplets
is
one
of
the
best
places
to
test
this
in
the
system
i
got
to
stay
and
check
it
nora
shook
her
head
paul
paul
looked
at
her
nora
he
said
soberly
we
at
again
two
things
are
important
in
my
life
one
of
them
is
nora
and
one
of
them
is
my
work
my
girl
and
my
work
do
not
agree
or
let
say
that
my
girl
does
not
agree
with
my
work
until
i
get
a
chance
to
prove
my
work
there
will
always
be
this
conflict
since
it
takes
such
a
short
time
to
prove
my
work
why
not
wait
nora
looked
up
at
him
i
wait
she
said
simply
will
you
marry
me
now
nora
smiled
yes
if
you
do
mind
a
wife
with
literally
nothing
to
wear
everything
i
own
is
on
me
right
now
but
wo
we
have
to
go
to
neoterra
here
we
go
again
growled
paul
nora
laughed
and
kissed
him
do
you
want
to
wait
three
months
for
the
radio
beams
to
cross
latham
triplets
she
asked
him
i
wait
a
minute
what
paul
it
is
barely
possible
that
his
voice
trailed
away
as
he
eyed
a
dusty
calendar
on
one
of
the
desks
he
went
to
it
and
began
flipping
pages
it
barely
possible
that
my
gang
did
not
turn
off
the
radio
beacons
for
a
couple
of
weeks
after
i
got
caught
by
westlake
muttered
paul
just
barely
possible
he
went
to
the
beacon
receiver
and
turned
it
on
impatiently
he
waited
for
it
to
warm
up
it
came
to
life
and
paul
tuned
carefully
through
the
band
where
he
expected
the
beacons
to
come
through
there
was
silence
he
ran
the
dial
far
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
at
one
point
he
picked
up
some
splash
from
the
big
interstellar
beacon
on
latham
alpha
iv
leakage
from
the
tight
beam
he
sat
up
stiffly
nora
will
you
wait
a
week
week
i
caught
some
of
the
radiation
leakage
from
the
big
transmitter
we
can
use
that
and
if
you
fail
i
wo
fail
then
if
you
succeed
nora
if
i
succeed
i
ask
you
to
wait
another
three
months
because
if
i
succeed
i
want
to
wait
until
the
galactic
survey
link
between
latham
alpha
iv
and
old
baldy
comes
in
then
how
are
you
going
to
check
between
here
and
alpha
iv
stacey
and
morrow
and
you
and
i
he
said
his
voice
trailed
away
for
a
moment
and
then
he
forgot
what
he
was
going
to
say
because
he
was
busy
with
the
instrument
panel
albert
donatti
had
been
editor
of
the
neoterra
through
three
changes
of
policy
the
claiming
to
be
politically
neutral
was
definitely
neutral
on
the
coalition
side
presenting
the
autonomy
party
in
less
than
favorable
light
while
tending
to
gloss
over
any
missteps
taken
by
the
coalitionists
like
the
other
newspapers
the
neoterra
subscribed
to
the
neosol
wire
service
and
so
al
donatti
got
the
same
news
that
the
other
subscribers
did
al
had
been
sitting
at
his
desk
all
morning
trying
to
think
up
something
bright
and
brilliant
to
say
about
huston
and
his
plans
or
something
bright
and
derogatory
to
say
about
hoagland
gang
even
donatti
had
become
tired
of
making
the
same
veiled
remarks
regarding
the
possibility
of
furnishing
terran
and
solarian
news
before
it
was
ten
months
old
but
he
knew
that
the
one
way
to
hold
the
home
tie
was
to
keep
on
offering
hope
the
virtual
disappearance
for
hoagland
was
not
inclined
to
give
out
his
plans
of
paul
grayson
had
put
a
crimp
in
the
schedule
for
they
never
knew
when
they
said
one
thing
whether
the
other
side
would
be
able
to
come
up
with
incontrovertible
truth
to
the
contrary
with
a
few
less
facets
to
play
upon
the
editorializing
of
huston
and
the
was
almost
reduced
to
the
constant
harping
on
a
single
subject
which
is
tiring
even
to
the
most
ardent
enthusiast
even
a
faithful
believer
wants
some
shred
of
proof
so
the
coalition
party
was
in
the
same
state
as
a
prize
fighter
who
has
trained
too
fine
who
has
reached
the
pinnacle
of
physical
perfection
some
time
before
the
fray
the
additional
newscopy
that
would
have
been
furnished
by
paul
grayson
presence
among
the
coalition
group
had
been
diminished
that
additional
space
would
have
kept
the
campaign
rising
upward
it
had
been
a
long
dry
stretch
even
for
an
imaginative
editor
with
a
bill
of
goods
to
sell
manufacturing
news
is
one
of
the
hardest
things
in
the
world
after
the
process
has
gone
on
for
month
after
month
donatti
was
reaching
the
end
of
the
string
and
there
were
still
months
to
go
donatti
groaned
and
then
looked
up
to
see
a
copy
boy
approaching
waving
a
reel
of
recording
tape
in
one
hand
yes
said
the
copy
boy
breathlessly
so
what
grunted
donatti
taking
the
reel
and
slipping
it
into
his
playback
it
started
neosol
wire
service
neovenus
four
august
archeologists
today
discovered
the
traces
of
a
crude
civilization
dating
at
least
seven
thous
donatti
groaned
that
would
make
page
eighteen
sandwiched
between
an
ad
and
the
local
theatre
and
years
old
no
trace
of
this
civilization
remains
today
crude
pottery
and
some
stone
arrowheads
crude
pottery
and
stone
arrowheads
snapped
donatti
so
what
this
business
were
found
among
buried
bones
it
has
been
an
elementary
principle
among
archeologists
that
proper
burial
of
the
dead
is
an
indication
of
intell
hell
exploded
donatti
so
this
thing
came
from
neovenus
they
all
do
igence
the
arrowheads
bear
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
prehistoric
arrowheads
found
on
terra
however
no
connection
between
the
stellar
planets
can
be
assumed
since
arrowheads
are
a
natural
bit
of
design
among
primitive
peoples
and
here
there
came
another
voice
superimposed
upon
the
dry
voice
of

you

fellers
both
of

else
in

that
some

coming
in
like
a

of
now
will
connection
had
ever
existed
between
the
distant
cultures
i
do
want
to
believe
you
but
is
this
ever
it
is
of
basic
interest
to
know
that
there
was
a
civilized
short
distance
as
interstellar
distances
go
three
culture
in
the

other
than
solarium
humankind
is
not
anywhere
near
as
far
as
several

less
as
the

is
explored
other

and
civilizations
this
is
just
the

it

not
you

no
paul
i
mean
with
unlikely
that
our
technical
perfection
may
be
overshadowed
of
science
and
men
you
should
know
your
place
by
some
greater

whose

of

may
i
should
extend
back
earlier
than
the
history
of
mankind
me
to
say
this
over
the
air
donatti
listened
to
the
unmistakable
sounds
of
ardent
osculation
with
a
saccharine
expression
on
his
face
then
the
fatuous
look
died
to
be
replaced
by
sudden
excitement
with
one
hand
he
stopped
the
playback
and
with
the
other
he
grabbed
the
telephone
get
me
huston
he
roared
what
do
you
need
a
telephone
for
asked
the
operator
the
connection
was
made
in
a
hurry
huston
the
is
in
in
it
in
goddammit
and
i
got
proof
proof
do
stand
there
gabbing
get
over
here
you
sure
donatti
laughed
i
just
heard
nora
kissing
grayson
via
you
what
you
heard
me
the
phone
clicked
donatti
reached
for
the

stop
everything
he
roared
break
down
the
first

and
set
up

get
over

and
do
something
about
it
you
can
run
a

do
bother
to
script
it
first
go
down
and
set
it
up
timmy
bust
out
a

and
nora
phillips
if
you

just
before
the

with

and
not

informative
details
later
you
know
forhan
see
if
you
can
get
a
statement
as
if
we
need
one
but
it
do
no
harm
from
senator

do
the

with

horace
we
print
side
by

carol
go
out
to
dirty
joe
and
bring
me
back
a
gallon
of
black
coffee
the
office
was
ticking
like
a
time
bomb
about
to
go
off
when
huston
came
in
his
first
words
were
did
anybody
have
the
brains
to
try
calling
back
ah
i
doubt
it
dammit
do
it
you
try
calling
back
and
you
huston
scowled
they
out
there
on
latham
triplets
all
alone
and
unprotected
what
happens
next
i
can
imagine
well
this
is
what
amounts
to
war
i
collecting
what
i
can
to
go
out
there
and
see
that
they
protected
good
luck
said
donatti
wan
na
hear
the
record
before
you
take
off
i
can
wait
that
long
yes
the
superimposed
recording
was
just
ending
when
one
of
the
office
boys
brought
back
two
papers
one
of
them
was
donatti
with
in
a
bright
red
headline
across
the
top
the
other
was
as
red
as
large
and
as
vigorous
it
said
merely
lies
this
is
still
a
dirty
fight
said
huston
sourly
he
scanned
the
opposition
paper
with
a
sneer
prepared
recording
false
evidence
untruth
political
maneuvering
smear
technique
untruth
false
hope
clever
machine
politics
o
hell
donatti
the
only
way
to
shut
these
bastards
up
i
can
guess
well
that
what
i
going
to
do
huston
left
donatti
office
on
the
dead
run
hoagland
faced
his
underlings
across
the
desk
his
eyes
glittering
so
i
played
a
hunch
and
was
wrong
it
not
gone
yet
all
we
have
to
do
is
play
it
close
but
what
can
we
do
outguess
how
you
not
very
bright
are
you
sneered
hoagland
good
thing
jeffers
is
running
the
paper
you
know
do
you
jeffers
sure
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
reproduce
a
recording
of
grayson
first
false
attempt
on
proxima
i
right
and
then
then
the
only
thing
that
will
convince
the
great
public
is
to
have
the
president
of
terra
himself
make
a
talk
over
the
between
terra
and
here
and
do
think
that
huston
wo
try
of
course
he
try
even
if
he
were
far
ahead
he
try
because
he
is
no
idiot
but
if
he
does
then
the
failure
itself
can
be
used
correct
said
hoagland
so
you
stay
tight
at
your
desk
and
get
ready
to
blast
out
of
their
pants
when
president
bennington
does
come
through
hoagland
turned
to
a
tall
slender
elderly
man
with
a
bit
of
a
squint
that
came
extraordinarily
out
of
sharp
eyes
astronomers
he
snorted
doctor
hargreave
shrugged
that
why
the
galactic
survey
was
started
he
said
quietly
because
we
did
not
know
the
precisely
accurate
distances
between
the
stars
do
blame
me
your
election
date
was
set
by
law
a
long
time
ago
do
blame
me
if
the
galactic
network
is
completed
before
election
day
we
had
only
physical
observation
to
go
on
it
not
my
fault
hoagland
nodded
unhappily
i
know
he
admitted
unhappily
but
if
the
galactic
network
is
completed
before
election
day
it
will
be
my
failure
chapter
for
four
solid
months
al
donatti
tried
to
reply
by
and
failed
this
was
because
grayson
was
busy
following
the
radio
beacon
between
latham
alpha
and
the
next
galactic
survey
station
along
the
network
because
of
daily
contact
and
a
certain
amount
of
quavering
faith
no
one
dared
to
retune
the
dials
paul
and
nora
followed
the
beacon
in
almost
to
the
station
then
because
paul
did
not
know
that
he
had
already
established
contact
across
a
myriad
of
relay
connections
all
the
way
back
to
neoterra
he
waited
in
space
until
he
could
pick
up
the
beacon
beyond
the
next
link
two
light
weeks
out
beyond
the
radio
link
paul
was
still
conversing
with
stacey
and
morrow
now
nora
nodded
you
done
it
she
said
we
in
here
was
no
grand
celebration
over
a
quick
success
here
was
the
culmination
of
gradual
acceptance
a
sort
of
of
knowledge
gradual
and
complete
it
was
hard
to
define
the
line
between
promise
and
fulfillment
only
by
personally
setting
a
date
and
using
it
as
the
could
the
time
of
proof
be
set
but
this
was
it
paul
yes
i
glad
for
you
and
you
nora
nodded
happily
pretty
soon
paul
any
day
in
the
week
nora
pouted
paul
i
want
some
clothing
i
feel
seedy
you
look
good
to
me
nora
laughed
i
look
better
in
some
new
clothes
paul
eyed
her
carefully
boldly
there
had
been
clothing
on
latham
beta
iii
for
nora
from
a
few
of
the
wives
that
were
reasonably
similar
in
size
the
dress
that
nora
had
worn
during
the
escape
from
westlake
little
college
had
been
the
best
fitted
among
the
clothing
and
nora
wore
it
now
she
knew
that
even
though
it
was
a
bit
overworked
she
looked
better
in
it
than
in
any
of
the
clothing
she
had
borrowed
nora
returned
paul
appraisal
of
her
with
a
flaunt
of
her
hip
so
so
he
said
paul
turned
toward
the
control
panel
and
made
some
computations
and
some
settings
on
the
dials
nora
pouted
why
the
he
asked
nora
chuckled
trigonometry
she
said
first
things
first
paul
replied
the
floor
surged
upward
causing
nora
to
lose
her
balance
paul
caught
her
neatly
we
on
our
way
he
said
nora
looked
up
in
his
eyes
silently
there
was
no
point
in
saying
anything
the
months
ago
on
neoterra
to
paul
and
nora
was
a
sort
of
landmark
that
did
not
require
any
further
amplification
that
was
finished
and
done
there
had
been
restraint
now
it
seemed
childish
like
a
youngster
who
saves
the
fanciest
chocolate
for
the
last
and
best
this
was
the
last
and
best
and
both
of
them
knew
it
her
lips
were
softer
warmer
more
eager
in
all
of
their
previous
lovemaking
there
had
been
a
strident
vigor
and
an
avid
clutching
for
one
another
a
sort
of
regret
that
fulfillment
was
yet
to
come
but
not
yet
here
now
this
frantic
reaching
seemed
gone
paul
knew
the
free
relaxation
of
nora
softness
against
him
he
felt
the
sweet
lassitude
soften
her
his
hands
caressed
her
and
nora
moved
to
relish
the
caress
paul
i
love
you
i
know
you
do
mind
if
i
know
i
want
you
to
know
eleven
days
later
they
landed
on
latham
alpha
iv
stacey
greeted
them
with
so
now
what
children
neosol
stacey
eyed
them
with
envy
somewhere
along
in
this
mad
pattern
i
recall
vaguely
that
i
have
a
wife
named
gloria
and
a
daughter
both
of
whom
think
i
am
deceased
looking
at
you
two
makes
me
want
to
howl
at
the
moon
if
i
could
find
a
moon
to
howl
at
on
this
misbegotten
planet
you
can
head
for
neoterra
but
does
anybody
mind
if
i
head
for
home
and
fireside
i
want
to
walk
in
and
be
a
great
shock
to
my
wife
you
shut
up
snapped
stacey
or
i
tell
nora
about
you
please
do
anyway
stacey
you
stay
out
of
this
bribe
me
chum
i
not
incorruptible
nora
smiled
maybe
i
can
offer
something
possibly
like
a
sum
of
money
or
a
nah
personal
gift
what
kind
such
as
a
good
book
nah
he
hard
to
please
complained
nora
i
not
hard
to
please
just
keep
making
offers
you
hit
on
something
i
tell
gloria
suggested
paul
stacey
cleared
his
throat
gloria
is
a
very
smart
woman
he
said
she
would
believe
you
only
if
she
had
seventeen
confirming
witnesses
or
the
odd
look
on
my
face
so
migawd
what
was
that
the
ground
trembled
and
the
air
racketed
to
the
blast
of
explosion
a
flash
of
white
flame
filled
the
sky
had
the
blast
been
atomic
the
would
have
flattened
the
latham
alpha
iv
station
it
was
that
close
but
it
was
just
common
high
explosive
of
the
chemical
type
that
shattered
at
them
and
cracked
a
couple
of
windows
in
the
relay
station
not
far
away
bombs
shouted
stacey
paul
raced
to
the
control
panel
and
set
the
drive
he
wanted
to
get
a
long
way
from
there
and
he
did
not
care
which
way
just
away
hoagland
crew
had
gotten
off
first
this
followed
a
certain
kind
of
reasoning
that
shows
less
troublesome
planning
to
destroy
than
to
protect
his
crews
had
driven
their
ships
as
fast
and
as
hard
as
ships
and
men
could
stand
the
gaff
the
flight
had
dropped
down
out
of
supervelocity
one
by
one
a
quarter
of
a
light
year
from
latham
alpha
coming
into
real
space
in
a
volume
spherically
as
large
as
the
outer
limits
of
the
solar
system
here
the
earlier
arrivals
had
waited
for
the
followers
since
no
two
ships
could
drive
at
precisely
the
same
speed
across
a
galactic
distance
they
had
closed
down
into
formation
as
they
came
out
of
superspeed
each
arrival
taking
its
place
in
the
space
pattern
finally
hoagland
counted
noses
and
found
them
all
in
place
then
latham
alpha
iv
the
galactic
relay
station
the
ships
went
into
superdrive
briefly
to
return
a
few
hundred
thousand
miles
above
the
ice
cap
where
the
relay
station
stood
waiting
the
last
few
hours
of
its
term
of
years
for
the
arrival
of
the
last
link
in
the
galactic
network
hoagland
flight
lined
down
on
a
long
curve
one
ship
after
the
other
each
pilot
aiming
for
the
station
it
had
been
the
first
bomb
a
clean
miss
that
had
alerted
paul
grayson
little
group
get
that
ship
roared
hoagland
the
leading
ship
having
bombed
and
missed
curled
upward
after
its
bombing
dive
circled
around
and
got
on
the
tail
of
spacecraft
the
second
ship
made
a
closer
miss
circled
the
course
and
laid
its
nose
behind
the
first
a
burst
of
orange
flame
licked
across
the
nose
of
hoagland
number
one
craft
and
the
shell
glanced
from
grayson
flank
sending
a
ringing
crash
through
paul
ship
all
three
of
them
looked
behind
to
see
ship
after
ship
line
up
to
race
after
them
paul
reached
for
the
high
drive
it
was
almost
warm
enough
to
use
huston
flight
had
taken
off
a
few
hours
later
there
had
been
a
lot
of
preparation
data
regarding
dates
flight
velocities
and
some
calculations
as
to
the
completion
of
the
network
then
a
courier
ship
had
been
prepared
prepared
like
no
ship
had
ever
been
prepared
before
unmanned
but
timed
to
perfection
courier
ships
crossed
space
between
sol
and
neosol
in
half
the
time
of
passenger
flights
they
carried
tons
of
official
mail
ordinary
commercial
mail
was
not
permitted
here
in
huston
special
courier
the
tons
of
official
mail
had
been
whittled
down
to
one
piece
four
pages
of
tissue
paper
and
the
remaining
load
had
been
filled
up
with
additional
the
timing
had
been
calculated
to
perfection
and
the
timing
circuits
had
been
carefully
checked
by
the
standards
technicians
then
the
drive
had
been
set
and
the
ship
had
taken
off
for
terra
in
a
flight
calculated
to
make
history
only
then
did
huston
flight
form
and
leap
into
space
from
neoterra
driving
as
hard
and
as
fast
as
men
and
machinery
would
permit
crew
came
down
out
of
supervelocity
four
months
later
a
couple
of
light
months
south
galactic
from
latham
beta
like
hoagland
huston
waited
in
space
until
the
stragglers
came
through
unlike
hoagland
huston
had
to
wait
because
he
was
going
to
defend
not
make
a
destructive
attack
once
the
flight
had
formed
they
circled
latham
beta
and
headed
for
alpha
in
superdrive
they
came
in
to
one
side
of
alpha
iv
and
circled
the
planet
less
than
a
hundred
miles
up
coming
around
the
planet
in
time
to
watch
the
first
line
of
ship
start
the
bombing
run
you
know
the
score
snapped
huston
that
relay
station
remain
intact
until
the
network
beam
gets
here
protect
it
huston
flight
spread
out
a
bit
and
streaked
across
the
ice
cap
hitting
hoagland
bombing
curve
in
the
middle
ship
after
ship
orange
flames
licked
the
noses
of
huston
craft
and
the
shells
screamed
across
the
ice
cap
to
flash
in
and
around
hoagland
flight
the
careening
ships
and
the
flight
of
screaming
shells
destroyed
the
flight
perfection
of
the
bombing
pilots
the
ice
cap
blazed
with
dots
of
flame
and
pillars
of
smoke
as
the
bombs
landed
in
a
shotgun
pattern
around
but
never
quite
on
the
relay
station
huston
men
spotted
the
game
forming
at
the
upward
swing
of
the
bombing
run
and
the
ships
roared
for
like
twin
corkscrews
both
flights
spiralled
up
after
grayson
fleeing
ship
grayson
roared
huston
grayson
yeah
it
was
now
because
all
of
the
ships
were
in
combat
not
the
galactic
separation
that
made
original
contact
necessary
grayson
this
is
huston
how
long
before
the
beacon
beam
arrives
hours
huston
groaned
we
got
to
defend
that
station
for
hours
or
defeat
hoagland
completely
huston
flight
split
into
two
one
of
them
spiralled
down
to
race
in
a
large
circle
high
around
the
relay
station
the
rest
of
them
remaining
in
the
locked
spiral
of
the
flight
grayson
snapped
the
high
drive
and
his
ship
flashed
into
superdrive
and
away
hoagland
flight
gave
up
the
chase
and
looped
up
and
over
and
down
towards
the
station
again
huston
cut
the
corner
of
the
curve
and
passed
through
hoagland
ships
the
barking
it
was
a
maneuver
similar
to
crossing
the
tee
in
naval
warfare
one
shell
drilled
in
through
the
fore
port
of
hoagland
ninth
ship
and
the
velocity
of
the
ship
carried
the
racketing
bit
of
metal
back
through
the
guts
of
the
ship
where
it
glanced
viciously
from
wall
to
wall
lights
went
dark
and
then
the
ship
lost
drive
as
the
round
hit
some
of
the
vital
wiring
inert
the
ship
continued
on
its
course
freely
curving
down
towards
alpha
iv
to
land
with
a
blossom
of
flame
as
the
blew
their
atomic
load
space
flashed
bright
as
one
of
huston
craft
rammed
its
enemy
a
flare
of
molten
metal
splashed
wide
and
bits
of
solid
jagged
hull
sprinkled
space
with
deadly
missiles
that
caused
the
following
ships
to
veer
wide
a
third
ship
exploded
violently
as
one
of
huston
shells
drilled
the
drive
chamber
one
of
huston
ships
ran
into
one
of
the
jags
of
hull
and
went
inert
the
pilot
fought
it
while
the
crew
struggled
with
the
ruined
wiring
arcs
and
flares
filled
the
ship
as
the
air
dropped
in
pressure
within
the
ship
then
the
electrical
arcs
went
out
as
vacuum
came
struggling
against
the
crew
floated
in
the
ship
hurling
tools
to
direct
themselves
tossing
cables
across
the
a
dim
light
came
on
as
the
ship
dropped
toward
the
ice
cap
then
the
drive
returned
part
way
the
pilot
fought
the
ship
down
to
a
racketing
sliding
crash
that
hurled
up
a
fountain
of
chipped
ice
and
strewed
the
furrow
with
fragments
of
ship
those
of
the
crew
who
survived
the
crash
leaped
from
the
ship
through
jagged
holes
in
the
hull
and
raced
for
the
relay
station
all
of
them
remembered
one
main
tenet
of
warfare
eventually
no
matter
how
outrageous
or
how
efficient
grow
the
mechanized
weapons
of
warfare
it
is
the
man
with
the
bared
knife
that
subdues
his
enemy
on
the
contested
ground
revolvers
shattered
the
locked
door
of
the
station
and
the
men
took
shelter
inside
they
might
be
sitting
ducks
for
a
bombing
run
if
their
pilots
could
stop
hoagland
bombing
runs
hoagland
men
would
eventually
have
to
land
and
make
for
the
station
on
foot
then
they
would
be
ready
the
downward
circle
of
hoagland
flight
circled
the
entire
planet
crossed
below
the
antipodal
and
came
roaring
across
the
planet
just
above
the
stratosphere
huston
was
waiting
for
them
and
the
two
flights
plowed
into
one
another
head
on
now
both
flights
were
facing
each
other
and
the
vomited
their
rain
of
solid
shells
had
this
been
a
battle
between
trained
and
space
forces
it
would
have
been
sheer
carnage
but
the
space
rifles
were
not
nor
electronically
fired
these
were
ships
of
commerce
locked
in
combat
as
deadly
as
man
against
man
but
lacking
the
finer
techniques
of
modern
ship
after
ship
trained
on
one
another
and
raced
towards
one
another
on
dead
course
the
space
rifle
spitted
as
fast
as
the
perspiring
could
serve
the
breech
it
was
blam
blam
blam
with
the
pilot
holding
the
course
dead
true
nose
toward
nose
across
the
ice
cap
each
pilot
trying
to
make
the
other
pilot
swing
aside
first
daring
and
trying
to
keep
his
own
nerves
from
screaming
while
he
looked
death
right
in
the
eye
and
spat
untrained
by
experience
and
lack
of
there
was
no
rule
regarding
the
final
tilt
from
the
collision
course
some
went
left
some
went
right
some
went
up
some
dodged
down
and
hit
the
planet
with
a
racketing
crash
and
a
shower
of
ice
amid
the
vomit
of
flame
as
the
drive
chamber
let
go
some
veered
into
one
another
course
and
the
stratosphere
flashed
high
and
wide
with
flame
and
terror
others
missed
cleanly
circling
left
and
right
others
coursed
up
and
over
with
one
pilot
tightening
the
curve
to
the
to
circle
the
course
and
end
up
with
his
nose
and
the
space
rifle
looking
down
the
drive
chamber
of
the
enemy
one
of
hoagland
pilots
circled
up
loosing
a
bomb
as
it
rose
huston
pilot
ran
into
the
bomb
and
the
sky
roared
white
and
hot
then
both
flights
were
through
one
another
and
circling
high
above
the
ice
cap
for
another
run
they
met
ten
thousand
miles
in
space
wide
spread
and
raced
at
one
another
in
a
mad
on
the
ground
below
survivors
leaped
from
cracked
ships
and
raced
to
safety
pitifully
few
survived
aligned
man
against
man
and
group
against
group
for
they
were
spread
out
across
a
area
they
fought
with
revolvers
and
stalked
one
another
across
the
hummocks
of
ice
and
laid
in
wait
in
defiles
and
passes
converging
on
the
station
holes
poked
in
the
glass
dome
near
the
edge
of
the
station
wall
sprouted
revolver
barrels
the
relay
station
became
a
block
house
protected
by
huston
survivors
the
first
crash
had
been
a
blessing
instead
of
a
defeat
for
huston
men
defended
the
station
against
hoagland
surviving
crews
huston
survivors
made
their
way
to
the
station
leaving
their
dead
and
the
dead
of
their
enemy
on
the
ice
behind
them
and
bit
by
bit
the
numbers
embattled
in
the
relay
station
grew
for
any
one
of
hoagland
men
once
within
the
station
could
stop
this
battle
merely
by
firing
a
single
revolver
shot
through
one
of
the
vitals
of
the
radio
beacon
receiver
or
hitting
it
with
any
hard
instrument
or
just
by
flipping
the
toggle
switch
that
controlled
the
entire
station
both
flights
diminished
now
hit
one
another
in
a
mad
pass
high
above
the
planet
space
filled
with
bits
of
jagged
metal
and
the
silent
shells
that
would
someday
end
up
as
satellites
to
some
distant
sun
to
possibly
confuse
some
space
miner
that
found
a
piece
of
completely
machined
and
fitted
with
copper
in
an
orbit
around
an
unpopulated
stellar
system
numbers
being
equal
huston
men
had
one
small
advantage
they
wanted
to
hit
hoagland
crew
hoagland
gang
had
two
objectives
they
wanted
to
destroy
the
station
and
so
part
of
their
efforts
was
directed
towards
the
station
itself
while
only
the
rest
was
directed
at
flight
the
flights
passed
through
one
another
leaving
space
strewn
with
ruin
and
circled
down
on
opposite
sides
of
a
great
circle
to
cross
the
ice
cap
face
to
face
again
only
a
few
miles
above
the
relay
station
perched
precisely
on
the
polar
axis
the
wind
whistled
and
the
atmosphere
took
on
another
odor
as
the
battle
raged
briefly
above
the
relay
station
the
ice
was
dotted
again
with
divots
of
flaming
hell
thrown
high
by
missed
bombs
and
water
ran
from
the
hot
craters
in
starred
rivulets
to
freeze
later
in
a
curiously
beautiful
pattern
again
diminished
the
flights
whirled
stalking
and
sparring
like
swordsmen
cautious
angry
hating
and
while
the
embattled
fleets
of
spacecraft
circled
one
another
paul
grayson
was
far
in
space
coming
out
of
superdrive
confident
that
he
had
outrun
or
at
least
disappeared
from
instant
contact
with
the
enemy
alpha
iv
was
far
far
behind
latham
triplets
were
only
stars
in
a
neat
equilateral
triangle
below
very
bright
stars
but
none
the
less
true
stars
showing
no
disc
to
the
naked
eye
now
what
asked
stacey
that
was
damned
close
little
friend
do
we
go
back
asked
nora
i
rather
not
said
stacey
i
prefer
to
die
in
bed
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
seventeen
after
a
long
pleasant
active
and
interesting
life
huston
is
down
there
too
you
know
said
paul
thoughtfully
so
what
he
apparently
came
with
quite
a
gang
stacey
grunted
let
wait
until
we
sure
that
the
unpleasantness
has
subsided
someone
will
be
yelling
vidi
vici
and
i
want
to
be
sure
that
the
guy
yelling
is
on
my
side
grayson
shook
his
head
thoughtfully
huston
got
here
he
said
so
hoagland
and
his
gang
must
have
grayson
voice
trailed
away
as
paul
went
into
another
reverie
of
thought
paul
this
is
what
is
commonly
referred
to
as
patently
obvious
paul
snapped
out
of
it
again
he
said
slowly
neither
hoagland
nor
huston
would
be
down
here
with
fire
in
their
eyes
if
they
did
not
know
succeeded
nora
blinked
they
must
have
overheard
us
she
said
paul
spread
his
hands
why
not
the
link
was
solid
between
triplets
and
neoterra
we
might
have
interfered
with
their
that
fine
reasoning
but
now
take
the
next
step
and
where
are
we
huston
wanted
to
know
how
long
before
the
beam
came
in
said
paul
then
he
groaned
and
said
that
they
have
to
defend
the
station
for
hours
after
which
said
stacey
we
left
somewhat
precipitously
if
not
graciously
i
do
blame
us
but
of
course
we
are
sort
of
biased
by
our
own
feelings
but
why
asked
nora
i
been
away
from
the
galactic
survey
for
a
long
time
said
paul
thoughtfully
it
more
than
possible
that
latham
triplets
is
the
station
that
completes
the
link
there
is
always
some
question
as
to
where
the
final
beam
would
cross
because
we
were
not
sure
what
the
precise
stellar
separation
was
in
fact
he
said
with
a
smile
this
determination
of
stellar
distances
was
the
reason
for
originating
the
galactic
survey
now
if
latham
alpha
turned
out
to
be
the
final
link
coming
a
bit
early
haedaecker
theory
was
wrong
the
link
between
sol
and
neosol
could
be
complete
by
once
the
radio
contact
checked
in
huston
might
have
some
plan
again
paul
trailed
off
as
he
began
to
think
about
the
subject
deeply
and
prompted
nora
the
final
link
should
be
heading
towards
alpha
iv
quite
close
by
now
said
paul
we
tap
it
before
it
lands
chapter
the
courier
spacecraft
dropped
down
out
of
supervelocity
and
emitted
an
overwhelming
blast
of
radio
signal
one
half
of
the
output
tube
operating
life
went
into
eternity
in
one
half
minute
of
intense
power
minutes
later
space
stations
picked
up
the
radio
blast
and
had
radiogoniometers
pointing
the
angle
which
when
correlated
with
other
space
stations
bracketed
the
courier
spacecraft
nicely
a
telemeter
beam
fingered
out
and
caught
the
circuits
of
the
courier
and
the
courier
turned
obediently
and
started
to
blast
towards
terra
it
landed
in
a
screaming
arc
and
came
to
rest
smoking
both
outside
and
inside
for
the
driving
circuits
had
been
running
at
overload
for
nearly
four
months
technicians
at
great
lakes
spaceport
trundled
the
courier
along
a
runway
and
dunked
the
whole
thing
into
lake
michigan
where
they
watched
the
clouds
of
steam
boil
up
and
then
subside
as
the
hull
cooled
they
waited
and
then
they
breached
the
message
hull
which
was
a
separable
nose
accustomed
to
finding
tons
of
mail
they
were
shocked
to
find
only
one
officially
sealed
envelope
addressed
to
the
president
of
terra
they
put
it
on
a
mail
speedster
that
arched
high
into
the
stratosphere
and
into
black
space
itself
in
a
vast
segment
of
ellipse
to
drop
into
the
hands
of
the
capitol
techs
within
a
matter
of
minutes
here
the
official
envelope
any
number
of
official
channels
president
bennington
heard
the
diffident
rap
on
his
bedroom
door
and
grunted
unhappily
then
he
came
awake
and
realized
that
nothing
less
than
an
official
affair
of
state
would
cause
his
aide
to
rap
on
his
door
bennington
snapped
the
light
on
near
his
bed
and
went
to
the
door
in
his
pajamas
what
up
phil
he
asked
as
he
opened
the
door
phillip
vanderveer
smiled
apologetically
i
do
know
he
said
honestly
but
when
a
courier
spacecraft
comes
from
neoterra
with
only
one
piece
of
mail
labeled
important
and
addressed
to
you
it
must
be
both
private
and
important
so
bennington
smiled
cigarette
he
asked
here
sir
come
in
said
bennington
accepting
the
smoke
but
er
is
sawing
wood
this
may
be
important
enough
for
fast
action
phil
come
on
in
and
for
bennington
opened
the
envelope
with
a
thumb
and
spread
out
the
pages
he
looked
and
then
found
a
magnifying
glass
and
went
to
work
on
the
pages
phil
he
said
slowly
forget
about
this
until
three
days
from
now
then
see
to
it
that
chadwick
haedaecker
is
summoned
here
for
a
bennington
went
on
to
peruse
a
calendar
and
then
a
clock
an
official
session
the
following
day
phillip
vanderveer
reported
that
haedaecker
was
out
on
some
tour
of
the
galactic
network
and
was
not
expected
back
for
some
time
that
was
too
bad
but
not
a
bar
to
the
future
actions
of
president
bennington
he
spent
the
next
two
days
closeted
with
his
aides
writing
a
flowery
speech
of
fancy
phrases
that
would
do
the
trick
he
decided
finally
to
make
his
speech
from
america
white
house
and
went
with
the
first
lady
to
terra
to
that
shrine
where
free
men
were
first
welded
into
a
strong
state
because
there
in
america
the
seeming
incompatibility
between
freedom
and
empire
had
been
favorably
resolved
bennington
prowled
the
mansion
looked
at
the
shrined
artifacts
and
was
he
himself
impressed
once
again
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
road
there
was
the
right
path
between
the
extremes
of
anarchy
and
tyranny
to
be
really
free
every
man
must
be
released
from
any
governing
which
would
make
him
a
unit
weak
enough
to
be
assailed
by
any
grouped
force
to
men
meant
they
had
too
little
to
say
about
their
own
lives
bennington
slept
in
a
bed
once
slept
in
by
andrew
jackson
it
was
midnight
of
the
third
day
the
shrined
white
house
was
a
blaze
of
lights
newsmen
and
radio
technicians
trod
the
revered
halls
and
strung
their
wires
the
connection
to
central
had
been
made
first
the
other
lines
to
the
rest
of
the
world
were
ready
the
lines
to
central
were
ready
to
bring
the
message
to
the
planets
of
sol
and
all
that
remained
was
the
final
connection
that
would
bring
president
address
to
the
worlds
of
neosol
bennington
sat
at
his
desk
with
a
fountain
pen
altering
the
long
speech
he
was
not
entirely
satisfied
with
it
it
contained
flowing
passages
calculated
to
jog
the
emotions
words
carefully
selected
because
of
their
syllables
to
cause
a
ringing
cadence
which
would
cause
an
emotional
reaction
it
was
flowery
and
forceful
it
was
long
starting
on
a
slow
measure
and
rising
to
a
proper
climax
completely
a
compilation
intended
to
sway
emotions
and
minds
in
the
right
direction
he
stood
up
from
time
to
time
and
delivered
portions
of
it
playbacks
returned
both
his
voice
and
his
appearance
to
him
and
bennington
worked
on
slight
faults
of
either
until
his
delivery
was
perfect
outside
of
his
room
bustling
technicians
checked
their
circuits
and
washington
itself
was
alive
with
the
tenseness
of
waiting
tired
and
with
hours
to
wait
yet
bennington
laid
down
on
a
couch
to
relax
his
slumber
was
fitful
dozing
interrupted
by
vivid
dreams
by
slight
noises
by
quick
flashes
of
intense
thought
by
his
mind
which
was
not
convinced
of
the
necessity
for
relaxation
finally
he
drifted
off
deep
completely
relaxed
for
the
first
time
in
three
days
they
counted
afterwards
that
president
bennington
had
only
a
total
of
nine
hours
sleep
in
then
a
bell
rang
a
siren
wailed
a
blast
of
shook
the
city
and
the
radio
across
terra
blasted
into
life
people
across
the
worlds
of
sol
awoke
they
had
been
sleeping
lightly
awaiting
the
moment
and
now
it
was
here
radio
sets
left
running
burst
into
life
waking
people
everywhere
among
the
planets
of
sol
at
the
same
instant
the
galactic
had
come
to
life
light
years
across
the

towards

grayson
talked
into
a
microphone
and
on
the
planets
that
were
sol
children
a
thousand
million
loudspeakers
thundered
forth
his
voice
president
bennington
president
bennington
bennington
awoke
from
his
fitful
nap
with
a
start
the
door
to
his
room
opened
phillip
vanderveer
stood
there
looking
in
he
approached
marian
bennington
smiled
quietly
this
is
it
bennington
looked
at
her
queerly
his
wife
somehow
strangely
unimpressed
by
the
solemnity
of
it
all
peculiarly
among
all
of
the
importance
of
the
moment
his
wife
greeting
him
with
a
slightly
amused
expression
greatness
of
moment
or
of
person
seemed
a
bit
remote
bennington
gulped
at
her
and
smiled
take
it
easy
hal
she
said
she
kissed
him
gently
as
he
leaned
towards
the
microphone
president
bennington
speaking
this
is
paul
grayson
riding
the
latham
alpha
iv
beam
towards
the
station
thank
god
you
ready
what
we
fifteen
light
minutes
out
from
contact
huston
is
fighting
to
keep
the
station
alive
hoagland
is
trying
to
kill
it
fighting
space
battle
dammit
man
oh
god
it
four
or
six
months
flight
time
there
it
yes
said
paul
just
stick
around
we
win
you
got
to
win
the
ice
cap
was
dotted
with
craters
tiny
spots
of
black
among
the
sea
of
glittering
white
were
men
struggling
in
the
icy
cold
to
reach
the
fight
for
the
final
link
between
mother
earth
and
her
distant
daughter
in
the
sky
above
isolationist
and
coalitionist
fought
with
nerve
and
iron
to
separate
versus
maintain
the
original
solidarity
of
the
galaxy
paul
riding
the
front
of
the
incoming
radio
beacon
beam
had
no
idea
of
how
the
fight
was
going
but
of
huston
hundred
ships
and
one
hundred
and
seventeen
of
hoagland
only
nine
were
left
with
huston
and
seven
left
with
hoagland
the
collected
survivors
in
the
relay
station
numbered
thirty
souls
determined
souls
of
the
same
determination
of
the
men
who
stood
at
concord
bridge
the
plain
around
the
station
was
a
mess
of
bomb
craters
desperation
measures
but
all
misses
the
glass
dome
itself
was
holed
with
a
of
shells
fired
into
the
station
and
three
of
the
big
parabolic
were
drilled
with
holes
but
still
electrically
functional
master
fighters
now
because
they
were
survivors
nine
and
seven
faced
one
another
cautiously
they
raced
in
faced
one
another
harshly
like
frigates
sailing
in
to
receive
a
heavy
broadside
clashed
and
came
on
through
as
five
and
three
huston
crew
circled
in
a
mad
melee
five
of
them
in
overwhelming
odds
now
they
herded
the
three
high
caught
them
in
an
englobement
and
made
a
flaming
kill
a
hundred
miles
above
the
planet
then
raced
forward
as
hoagland
started
to
flee
for
his
life
his
campaign
defeated
with
the
ice
cap
dotted
with
death
and
wreckage
huston
command
ship
left
the
other
four
to
guard
the
upper
sky
while
he
scouted
the
surface
using
his
power
ruthlessly
to
cow
hoagland
separated
survivors
into
abject
surrender
then
in
complete
victory
huston
raced
his
command
ship
in
a
vast
circle
around
the
damaged
but
still
running
relay
station
it
would
go
with
anyone
who
tried
to
interfere
at
this
instant
huston
engineer
snapped
in
the
grayson
grayson
are
you
are
you
the
receiver
in
paul
ship
brought
this
call
he
snapped
the
toggle
and
said
huston
i
riding
the
radio
beam
down
to
alpha
iv
bennington
i
got
him
on
the
let
me
connect
me
paul
reached
for
a
cable
with
a
plug
and
shoved
both
ends
home
in
his
mister
president
here
is
mr
huston
bennington
bennington
you
ready
on
terra
president
bennington
nodded
and
said
any
time
huston
said
good
thank
god
grayson
can
we
paul
considered
can
you
get
in
touch
with
the
latham
alpha
iv
station
direct
take
some
doing
but
president
bennington
the
galactic
link
is
almost
complete
via
radio
contact
from
terra
to
me
it
from
me
to
huston
and
from
alpha
iv
to
neoterra
it
is
again
via
radio
contact
as
soon
as
huston
taps
the
radio
beam
from
alpha
iv
we
can
get
you
through
to
a
flash
of
fire
and
vicious
blinded
huston
and
his
crew
it
killed
all
the
men
on
alpha
iv
friend
and
foe
alike
the
sound
the
sound
was
a
flat
and
silence
the
contact
had
been
destroyed
before
the
link
could
convey
any
sound
down
from
the
black
sky
a
single
ship
had
driven
at
velocities
too
high
for
the
radar
to
catch
it
had
come
at
velocity
from
somewhere
had
passed
alpha
iv
at
a
tangential
altitude
of
a
thousand
miles
and
had
loosened
something
the
something
had
been
unbelievable
tons
of
lithium
hydride
neatly
tamped
and
packed
around
a
fissionable
detonator
the
super
bomb
drilled
into
the
planetary
crust
a
full
quadrant
south
at
the
equator
of
alpha
iv
and
exploded
slowly
and
majestically
alpha
iv
expanded
the
crust
separated
along
the
to
expose
the
planetary
magma
ice
met
molten
lava
in
a
riot
of
exploding
steam
mountain
range
fell
into
the
sea
livid
streamers
of
tortured
matter
flared
forth
and
the
surface
heaved
bubbled
and
collapsed
and
the
smoke
and
dust
and
soil
of
alpha
rose
into
the
atmosphere
to
mingle
with
the
clouds
of
vaporized
metal
and
superheated
steam
that
roiled
and
blasted
away
from
the
planet
into
space
latham
alpha
iv
contracted
into
a
boiling
mass
of
energy
distributed
and
and
throughout
the
planetary
mass
gone
was
the
ice
cap
forever
lost
were
the
men
who
battled
face
to
face
and
gun
to
gun
to
keep
the
relay
station
running
then
latham
alpha
began
to
expand
slowly
and
majestically
it
grew
as
the
volatile
material
became
gaseous
with
the
energy
hurled
into
it
the
glow
died
into
a
furious
as
the
localized
areas
of
energy
spread
out
and
the
whole
of
the
planet
began
to
radiate
dully
across
space
heading
into
a
boiling
planetary
surface
that
had
no
receiver
to
collect
it
came
the
galactic
radio
beam
it
entered
the
roiling
planet
and
died
and
what
missed
the
planet
either
splashed
aside
from
the
energy
or
went
on
and
on
and
on
through
space
unchecked
and
unheeded
huston
spacecraft
hurled
upwards
by
the
force
of
flaming
gases
bounced
around
viciously
until
huston
pilot
snapped
the
high
drive
briefly
first
on
and
then
off
grayson
huston
what
has
happened
god
but
the
relay
the
network
paul
thought
a
moment
i
still
got
bennington
he
said
and
here
grayson
voice
paused
for
a
moment
grayson
ship
had
been
at
one
light
velocity
following
the
beam
towards
alpha
iv
now
as
he
sat
at
the
console
of
his
ship
drive
he
reached
for
a
switch
that
swerved
the
ship
aside
in
its
course
by
just
a
few
milliseconds
of
arc
seconds
later
he
passed
the
boiling
ruin
of
alpha
iv
by
a
miles
still
following
the
head
of
the
galactic
survey
beam
as
paul
passed
the
planetary
ruin
he
snapped
another
switch
picked
up
the
microphone
and
cried
al
donatti
al
donatti
and
down
from
neoterra
came
the
reply
grayson
you
got
bennington
on
the
other
end
back
in
the
white
house
president
bennington
sat
before
the
broad
desk
looking
at
the
microphone
with
an
odd
expression
on
his
face
somehow
flowery
speeches
and
fancy
words
seemed
a
bit
pale
and
unconvincing
in
the
face
of
men
who
lived
and
died
for
a
grand
principle
he
looked
up
at
the
wall
he
saw
a
bronze
plaque
president
bennington
speak
up
bennington
started
it
was
madison
was
it
madison
or
jackson
who
said
that
an
american
could
tell
the
president
to
go
to
hell
and
all
the
president
could
do
was
to
argue
with
him
or
go
fishing
bennington
tore
his
carefully
prepared
speech
down
the
middle
he
stood
up
and
looked
at
the
bronze
plaque
and
began
to
read
it
fourscore
and
seven
years
ago
across
space
to
latham
triplets
went
the
connected
at
long
last
by
the
original
radio
linkage
across
from
grayson
spacecraft
it
went
to
the
completed
link
to
neoterra
to
come
bursting
forth
from
a
thousand
million
loudspeakers
across
the
worlds
of
neosol
neoterra
heard
it
and
neovenus
listened
the
isolated
colonists
on
neoganymede
cheered
and
the
folks
on
far
neopluto
nodded
their
heads
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
to
determine
whether
that
nation
or
any
other
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
grayson
came
the
whispering
of
the
radio
a
mundane
instrument
of
no
great
interest
to
anyone
grayson
we
caught
him
who
your
pal
haedaecker
he
bombed
alpha
iv
but
we
twist
his
arm
grayson
maybe
he
explain
the
guy
who
tried
to
shoot
you
to
bits
on
proxima
i
maybe
a
lot
of
other
things
anyway
he
the
joker
in
this
deck
stacey
eyed
paul
with
a
glitter
d
mind
if
i
start
going
home
to
my
wife
paul
snapped
off
the
communications
panel
entirely
they
made
it
he
said
it
be
complete
from
now
on
and
we
this
galaxy
with
radio
beacons
from
star
to
star
and
bit
by
bit
until
the
contact
is
complete
between
mother
sol
and
any
of
her
colonies
let
take
stacey
home
suggested
nora
paul
turned
to
the
panel
and
set
some
switches
adjusted
some
dials
and
threw
in
the
main
switch
the
floor
surged
below
them
and
paul
put
his
eye
to
the
spotting
telescope
as
his
ship
began
to
move
paul
yawned
as
the
minutes
passed
and
the
ship
gained
speed
towards
sol
aimed
by
his
watchful
eye
time
passed
and
paul
finally
released
from
all
of
the
trouble
and
worry
began
to
hum
eventually
he
began
to
sing
in
that
voice
and
round
and
round
go
the
deuterons
round
and
round
and
round
the
magnet
swings
round
and
round
and
round
go
the
nora
interrupted
paul
with
the
final
line
of
the
nightmare
let
turn
the
damned
thing
off
and
go
to
bed
the
end
