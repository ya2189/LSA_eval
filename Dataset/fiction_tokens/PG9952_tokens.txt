the

the
tale
of
the

the
town
of
weir
the
faery
tales
of
weir
only
in
towns
are
the
real
faery
tales
told
in
shadowy
nurseries
whose
windows
in
summer
open
upon
shimmering
gardens
and
on
whose
walls
in
winter
the
dance
weir
is
one
of
these
towns
a
sweet
hushed
place
lying
where
the
hills
spread
broadly
to
the
south
sun
and
the
trees
are
thick
as
in
a
painting
there
are
shops
too
with
bulging
windows
through
which
you
can
scarcely
see
the
toys
or
the
flowers
or
the
sweetmeats
because
time
has
the
glass
with
violet
and
crimson
stains
that
shift
and
merge
so
that
the
contents
of
the
windows
are
seen
as
through
wavering
beyond
the
shops
are
the
houses
asleep
beneath
great
trees
their
warm
red
bricks
showing
where
the
ivy
has
thinned
their
stacked
chimneys
send
out
faint
blue
spirals
of
smoke
to
let
you
know
that
the
fires
are
on
the
hearths
and
about
the
hearths
the
children
are
gathered
the
little
old
churches
placed
where
weir
drowses
out
into
the
country
have
hoarse
sweet
bells
like
the
voices
of
old
women
who
whisper
of
the
christ
child
at
christmas
time
and
in
the
churches
are
windows
as
full
of
color
as
the
gardens
of
weir
the
sleepy
forgotten
town
was
famous
for
nothing
but
its
faery
tales
told
long
ago
to
children
whose
bright
eyes
have
looked
by
now
on
wider
scenes
and
whose
voices
have
died
away
on
that
wind
upon
which
all
voices
sink
from
hearing
at
last
i
sometimes
wonder
whether
in
imagination
they
all
troop
back
at
the
twilight
hour
hubert
to
cuddle
up
in
the
james
to
stretch
out
on
the
veronica
and
little
eve
to
nurse
their
dolls
and
gaze
through
the
nursery
window
half
fearfully
at
the
striding
dusk
or
to
listen
to
the
tap
upon
the
panes
of
flying
leaves
when
the
great
winds
rise
where
is
richard
who
always
wanted
a
tale
never
told
before
and
small
spencer
with
his
dreaming
eyes
and
baby
mouth
where
is
quaint
matilda
with
her
plaid
dress
and
her
straight
black
hair
where
is
ruth
wherever
they
are
i
like
to
think
that
to
them
weir
is
always
their
true
home
and
their
hearts
really
live
in
that
broad
shadowy
house
where
the
steps
of
the
staircase
were
so
wide
and
shallow
that
each
was
a
little
landing
in
itself
and
where
the
candles
flamed
at
night
in
high
sconces
and
in
the
halls
was
a
rustling
of
silk
and
in
the
air
the
smell
of
flowers
and
burning
wood
the
nursery
was
high
up
under
the
eaves
so
that
the
rest
of
the
house
seemed
a
wonderful
region
where
music
might
sound
or
where
by
stealing
down
one
might
see
fair
ladies
like
the
princesses
of
the
tales
smiling
at
gallant
gentlemen
one
own
mother
might
turn
indeed
into
a
princess
just
before
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
with
white
arms
and
jewels
upon
her
neck
then
one
fell
asleep
knowing
that
no
day
in
weir
could
be
without
its
enchantment
whether
the
clouds
seemed
caught
in
the
or
the
snow
flew
and
made
the
red
roofs
white
or
whether
the
sun
danced
on
the
green
lawns
for
each
day
ended
with
a
faery
tale
and
these
are
the
tales
of
weir
the
tale
of
the
blue
glove
the
king
of
the
south
country
was
not
as
happy
as
a
king
ought
to
be
whose
subjects
are
both
peaceful
and
industrious
every
night
when
the
moths
were
flying
and
the
tall
candles
were
lit
in
the
hall
when
the
soft
air
was
musical
with
the
strumming
of
harps
and
the
sweet
complaint
of
violins
he
would
walk
out
on
the
great
parapet
with
one
hand
under
his
chin
and
his
head
drooping
then
the
courtiers
would
say
the
king
is
sad
if
he
looked
out
he
could
see
town
after
town
like
strings
of
pearls
and
corals
with
blue
smoke
coming
from
the
chimneys
of
houses
and
beyond
the
towns
the
sea
like
a
green
bowl
if
he
looked
straight
down
he
could
see
a
rush
of
color
as
if
the
flowers
were
coming
up
to
him
in
billowy
waves
but
the
king
was
not
happy
for
the
reason
that
he
wanted
to
marry
his
three
sons
and
he
did
know
of
any
princesses
who
would
so
to
speak
fill
the
bill
he
had
journeyed
over
the
mountains
to
inspect
several
little
ladies
who
were
brought
to
him
in
their
stiff
satin
gowns
to
make
their
curtsey
and
smile
their
prettiest
but
none
of
them
seemed
desirable
for
a
daughter
the
king
knew
indeed
very
much
what
he
wanted
she
must
chatter
and
she
must
be
too
fond
of
chocolates
in
gold
and
enameled
boxes
and
she
must
have
likes
and
dislikes
and
she
must
be
patient
for
all
really
royal
people
know
how
to
wait
and
she
must
possess
the
beautiful
art
of
smiling
the
king
had
seen
her
in
the
frames
of
old
paintings
still
and
sweet
and
jeweled
but
never
alive
and
lovely
on
the
evening
when
this
tale
begins
the
king
was
watching
the
three
princes
play
at
ball
the
ball
was
of
scented
spanish
leather
covered
with
crimson
silk
on
which
was
stamped
the
sporting
dolphin
of
the
royal
house
sometimes
it
would
drop
to
the
green
turf
where
the
parrots
would
peck
at
it
thinking
it
a
gorgeous
apple
the
hooded
falcon
on
the
jester
arm
knew
better
for
the
jester
fed
him
real
apples
prince
hugh
prince
merlin
and
prince
richard
were
as
supple
as
willows
as
straight
as
pines
as
graceful
as
silver
birches
their
blond
hair
hung
thick
and
straight
against
their
necks
and
was
cut
square
above
their
level
brows
their
manners
were
so
good
that
their
father
quite
know
their
characters
and
that
made
the
problem
of
their
marriages
more
difficult
all
at
once
as
on
a
stage
they
stopped
playing
ball
and
began
to
look
at
something
or
someone
the
king
followed
their
eyes
and
saw
a
strange
sight
a
young
girl
with
a
great
dog
at
her
side
was
coming
slowly
over
the
grass
her
hands
clasped
above
her
breast
her
long
golden
hair
hanging
nearly
to
the
hem
of
her
gown
which
was
of
coarse
brown
wool
she
had
no
stockings
and
on
her
feet
she
wore
wooden
shoes
that
a
peasant
girl
should
walk
across
the
royal
gardens
was
enough
to
make
the
princes
stare
then
the
king
saw
that
they
were
looking
at
the
girl
hands
of
which
one
was
bare
on
the
other
was
a
glove
of
blue
heavily
embroidered
with
a
design
of
flowers
which
circled
themselves
about
a
tiny
mirror
set
exactly
on
the
wrist
no
glove
for
a
peasant
she
came
slowly
up
the
great
stairs
of
the
terrace
as
if
she
were
expected
by
this
time
the
had
rushed
out
full
of
officiousness
to
stop
the
outrage
but
the
king
at
the
end
of
a
puzzled
day
was
in
no
mood
to
hinder
the
least
diversion
he
advanced
to
meet
the
visitor
who
raised
to
him
a
pair
of
beautiful
blue
eyes
and
smiled
where
did
she
learn
to
smile
thought
the
king
conscious
that
the
gaze
of
the
three
princes
was
still
upon
the
girl
she
held
out
the
gloved
hand
king
cuthbert
i
am
sent
to
your
court
by
king
luke
will
you
be
pleased
to
look
in
my
mirror
her
wrist
was
raised
to
the
level
of
his
eyes
what
do
you
see
she
asked
in
a
soft
solicitous
voice
myself
maiden
he
replied
she
sighed
and
the
tears
came
in
her
eyes
who
else
could
i
see
he
exclaimed
she
smiled
and
shook
her
head
then
she
nodded
towards
the
three
straight
boys
on
the
lawn
those
are
your
sons
mine
indeed
maiden
i
am
sent
to
make
their
acquaintance
i
am
the
niece
of
king
luke
the
princess
myrtle
king
cuthbert
could
not
believe
his
ears
nor
trust
his
eyes
for
the
princess
myrtle
had
great
vaults
of
gold
under
the
turrets
of
her
castle
and
pearls
like
pigeon
eggs
in
the
renowned
diadem
with
which
the
generations
of
her
royal
race
were
crowned
kings
or
queens
my
uncle
sends
me
as
a
so
that
i
can
make
a
true
marriage
i
desire
to
be
loved
for
myself
alone
speak
not
of
me
to
the
court
but
deal
with
me
as
i
appear
to
be
king
cuthbert
gazed
in
admiration
at
her
for
she
had
the
voice
of
one
who
thinks
more
than
she
speaks
and
feels
more
than
she
thinks
which
is
the
proper
order
for
great
and
little
ladies
here
thought
he
is
the
child
i
have
been
seeking
i
will
not
tell
the
three
lads
so
beautifully
mannered
who
or
what
she
is
but
i
will
say
that
a
friend
hath
sent
an
orphaned
girl
to
be
protected
by
me
then
i
will
watch
how
they
treat
her
and
learn
at
last
what
my
sons
are
princess
myrtle
he
said
i
will
henceforth
treat
you
as
an
orphaned
and
poor
girl
is
that
to
your
liking
it
is
my
wish
sir
she
answered
and
suddenly
a
rising
wind
blew
all
the
strands
of
her
hair
into
a
cloud
of
gold
so
that
her
coarse
wool
dress
appeared
brocaded
and
while
she
was
thus
sumptuously
clothed
a
great
peacock
in
iridescent
array
strutted
by
her
and
she
placed
her
gloved
hand
for
a
moment
on
his
shining
feathers
looking
indeed
a
princess
back
of
her
the
courtiers
stared
and
rubbed
their
eyes
the
three
slim
boys
on
the
lawn
were
smiling
prince
hugh
tossed
the
scarlet
ball
to
her
and
she
caught
it
lightly
as
if
she
were
making
a
curtsey
take
the
ball
back
to
him
said
the
king
and
tell
him
i
sent
you
as
she
went
down
through
the
parterres
of
flowers
she
was
as
straight
as
a
delphinium
and
as
a
rose
where
the
great
trees
clouded
into
the
sky
she
looked
as
little
as
a
floating
petal
but
when
she
stepped
upon
the
sward
she
seemed
to
grow
tall
like
an
upward
soaring
flame
though
she
walked
with
such
courage
towards
the
three
slim
lads
her
heart
was
beating
fast
because
she
was
afraid
they
would
not
be
as
noble
as
they
looked
for
at
court
nearly
everyone
looks
noble
and
the
princess
myrtle
had
learned
how
easy
it
is
to
keep
your
eyes
level
and
your
head
high
and
your
bearing
proud
and
how
hard
it
is
to
preserve
a
sweet
heart
like
a
rose
within
the
shadow
of
this
grandeur
so
she
went
to
meet
the
princes
with
a
shy
hopeful
manner
the
scarlet
ball
in
her
hand
and
her
blue
eyes
addressed
to
theirs
i
am
commanded
by
your
royal
father
to
return
to
you
this
ball
she
said
i
pray
you
tell
me
said
prince
hugh
how
you
being
a
walk
as
if
possessed
of
wealth
she
smiled
all
people
are
rich
some
know
it
some
do
not
the
princeling
gave
a
royal
whistle
and
smiled
at
his
brother
richard
who
picked
a
white
carnation
and
began
to
pull
its
petals
tell
me
maid
why
you
wear
the
blue
glove
he
asked
to
cover
a
hand
still
my
own
she
returned
proudly
merlin
said
nothing
at
all
he
took
the
scarlet
ball
bowed
and
turned
from
her
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
heights
where
the
turrets
cut
the
sky
black
against
gold
and
the
whirling
beat
down
the
seaward
rushing
wind
then
stepping
softly
she
followed
merlin
who
walked
on
to
a
place
where
the
arching
trees
made
a
green
cave
and
in
the
depths
of
the
cave
was
a
fountain
of
marble
sunk
into
a
round
of
ferns
at
the
edge
the
prince
paused
then
he
dropped
the
ball
into
the
water
and
it
sank
for
it
was
solid
and
heavy
illustration
merlin
drops
the
ball
into
the
fountain
why
did
you
do
that
cried
the
princess
he
wheeled
about
and
looked
upon
her
coldly
why
have
you
followed
me
he
asked
to
pick
up
the
ball
should
you
drop
it
the
ball
is
drowned
he
said
why
did
you
put
it
in
the
water
she
asked
because
you
touched
it
he
replied
she
was
very
sad
then
you
scorn
to
touch
what
a
has
handled
she
asked
to
this
he
made
no
reply
but
strolled
away
into
the
green
wood
while
wearily
she
turned
back
the
with
their
collars
of
jade
came
to
meet
her
and
the
three
enormous
persian
cats
whose
tails
were
like
long
plumes
she
stooped
to
caress
them
and
to
hide
her
tears
for
prince
hugh
and
prince
richard
were
coming
towards
her
and
she
did
not
wish
them
to
know
she
was
sad
they
stood
like
twin
trees
regarding
her
then
prince
richard
spoke
will
you
sell
your
glove
and
he
drew
a
piece
of
gold
from
his
purse
she
replied
i
have
more
need
of
my
glove
than
of
your
gold
if
you
were
a
court
lady
said
prince
hugh
you
would
know
that
one
glove
is
of
no
use
to
anyone
if
you
were
a
beggar
sir
she
replied
you
would
be
glad
to
have
one
hand
warm
i
shall
never
be
a
beggar
returned
the
prince
proudly
yet
you
begged
your
father
for
a
falcon
hood
this
morning
prince
richard
laughed
and
his
brother
stared
are
you
a
witch
asked
the
latter
no
i
am
not
a
witch
i
lost
my
way
in
the
gardens
before
i
found
the
right
path
you
were
talking
in
the
arbor
by
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
you
implored
your
father
the
king
like
a
beggar
on
the
street
corner
prince
hugh
cheeks
were
red
as
peonies
your
words
are
too
bold
if
you
will
not
sell
your
glove
i
will
take
it
she
stretched
out
her
arm
you
will
not
be
able
to
take
what
is
not
yours
will
i
not
and
he
rushed
at
her
and
began
to
tug
at
the
glove
his
face
grew
redder
and
redder
but
he
could
not
strip
off
the
glove
which
seemed
to
have
grown
to
the
maid
arm
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
his
fiery
countenance
in
the
little
round
mirror
and
he
left
off
pulling
at
the
glove
but
his
failure
aroused
emulation
in
the
heart
of
prince
richard
who
now
began
to
tug
at
the
glove
as
if
it
were
heavy
armor
the
princess
myrtle
grew
as
white
as
a
in
pale
wintry
sunshine
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
three
of
the
princes
were
of
base
metal
beneath
their
noble
bearing
look
in
the
mirror
she
said
pitifully
and
tell
me
what
you
see
his
own
red
face
i
warrant
as
i
saw
mine
cried
prince
hugh
then
prince
richard
seeing
how
flushed
his
face
was
drew
away
sulkily
and
the
princess
walked
from
them
up
and
up
through
the
parterres
of
flowers
to
the
terrace
where
the
king
stood
in
the
evening
light
his
cloak
blown
out
so
that
the
satin
lining
showed
like
a
great
magnolia
petal
his
long
fingers
rested
on
the
marble
balustrade
and
the
royal
rings
winked
wickedly
at
the
princess
the
king
said
to
her
what
did
my
sons
say
and
do
to
you
then
she
related
everything
the
king
frowned
but
how
do
i
know
whether
you
are
really
the
princess
myrtle
you
may
for
all
that
be
but
a
or
a
she
replied
let
me
remain
in
your
court
three
days
as
a
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
are
not
sure
turn
me
out
i
too
will
be
sure
of
something
at
the
end
of
three
days
of
what
will
you
be
sure
asked
the
king
which
of
you
is
the
real
king
here
then
king
cuthbert
grew
red
like
old
leather
and
laughed
and
sighed
and
frowned
god
knows
i
should
myself
like
that
knowledge
then
he
signed
to
a
court
lady
who
was
looking
on
with
proud
eyes
come
dame
caecilia
take
this
to
one
of
the
suites
in
the
palace
and
put
fair
clothes
on
her
and
conduct
her
to
the
when
the
hour
strikes
the
court
lady
smiled
to
hide
her
anger
for
she
dared
not
disobey
and
she
beckoned
the
princess
myrtle
to
follow
her
they
went
through
a
vast
door
into
a
corridor
that
ran
beneath
heavy
arches
and
the
walls
of
this
passage
moved
as
if
alive
but
it
was
only
the
draught
swaying
the
tapestries
with
their
gray
trees
and
knights
who
rode
among
the
trees
like
heavy
shadows
and
women
who
watched
the
knights
ride
while
they
wove
then
the
proud
court
lady
took
the
princess
up
a
winding
stair
like
the
twisted
ways
of
life
down
more
corridors
then
into
a
room
through
whose
windows
high
cypresses
looked
and
upon
whose
ceiling
little
cupids
flew
about
now
beggar
she
said
angrily
throwing
open
the
door
of
a
wardrobe
where
hung
silken
things
make
the
most
of
your
luck
what
will
you
wear
here
is
mallow
satin
sewn
with
pearls
and
with
a
running
border
of
jasmine
flowers
done
in
sweet
embroidery
silks
will
it
please
you
here
is
a
silver
cloth
studded
with
little
coral
beads
over
a
petticoat
of
ancient
lace
here
is
black
velvet
softly
lined
with
apricot
brocade
nay
none
of
these
will
i
wear
but
my
gown
of
good
wool
and
in
my
bundle
are
changes
of
linen
for
i
want
no
lace
on
my
limbs
send
me
fresh
flowers
for
my
hair
i
entreat
you
and
i
will
bathe
and
so
prepare
myself
for
the
court
dinner
dame
caecilia
stared
at
her
and
moved
the
golden
combs
and
mirrors
about
angrily
on
the
you
will
lose
me
my
place
at
court
she
cried
perhaps
it
is
already
lost
answered
the
princess
you
speak
not
at
all
like
a
beggar
you
never
took
the
trouble
to
learn
what
a
beggar
really
says
the
princess
replied
as
she
stripped
the
blue
glove
from
her
hand
curiosity
got
the
better
of
the
court
lady
anger
what
person
gave
you
that
glove
in
place
of
alms
she
asked
my
godmother
out
of
faery
land
nonsense
cried
the
dame
and
she
departed
for
the
flowers
with
a
face
like
a
withered
leaf
the
little
princess
leaned
against
the
sill
of
the
window
and
sighed
and
looked
into
the
blue
sphere
of
the
night
and
wondered
on
what
altar
the
high
stars
were
lit
she
thought
of
merlin
who
had
drowned
his
ball
because
her
touch
was
on
it
and
her
heart
throbbed
as
if
a
hand
were
drawing
it
from
her
breast
to
place
it
out
of
her
reach
she
had
seen
little
maids
among
the
golden
shadows
of
her
own
court
with
their
white
hands
outstretched
towards
a
heart
someone
had
taken
now
the
thrilling
touch
of
that
theft
was
upon
her
own
spirit
her
thoughts
followed
merlin
as
if
her
substance
had
been
changed
into
his
shadow
all
the
court
had
assembled
for
dinner
when
she
entered
the
banquet
hall
behind
the
dame
caecilia
who
made
a
curtsey
to
the
floor
as
she
explained
to
the
king
that
the
being
lacking
in
art
refused
the
silken
clothes
she
would
wear
only
this
crown
of
wood
violets
then
the
princess
curtsied
and
all
the
courtiers
laughed
but
the
king
gravely
bowed
to
her
and
called
prince
hugh
prince
hugh
came
forward
looking
noble
as
was
his
wont
in
the
presence
of
his
father
what
is
your
will
sire
i
desire
you
to
lead
this
maiden
to
the
banquet
sire
i
have
already
asked
the
lady
diana
he
said
and
blushed
a
little
for
he
was
lying
the
king
then
asked
a
lackey
to
summon
prince
richard
who
came
looking
noble
as
was
his
custom
also
in
the
presence
of
his
father
i
desire
you
to
lead
this
maiden
to
the
banquet
prince
richard
still
endeavored
to
look
noble
sire
he
replied
i
am
not
dining
i
have
a
headache
then
king
cuthbert
sent
for
prince
merlin
now
when
the
princess
myrtle
heard
his
name
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
musicians
had
begun
to
play
in
a
room
she
drooped
her
head
a
little
lest
she
should
show
tears
in
her
eyes
when
he
too
refused
her
he
came
up
white
and
grave
with
a
look
that
was
not
patient
when
his
father
made
the
request
of
him
that
he
made
of
his
other
sons
prince
merlin
bowed
and
extended
his
arm
to
the
but
he
was
as
silent
as
a
wood
before
a
storm
only
the
princess
quivered
like
a
leaf
that
expects
a
great
wind
to
pass
did
you
obey
your
father
because
you
are
sorry
for
me
she
whispered
no
i
obeyed
him
because
he
is
the
king
not
i
am
sorry
for
myself
rather
than
you
then
the
princess
felt
her
soul
sink
into
a
gulf
but
she
smiled
and
ate
the
food
that
was
offered
her
and
made
no
attempt
to
speak
to
prince
merlin
all
the
next
day
she
wandered
in
the
through
marvelous
terraces
and
under
the
great
trees
but
no
one
spoke
to
her
nor
could
she
see
anything
but
vanishing
forms
and
so
it
was
until
evening
when
wearied
she
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
gazed
into
her
mirror
and
gave
a
cry
of
joy
now
said
she
i
love
truly
by
this
sign
i
know
i
love
truly
for
i
see
merlin
face
in
the
mirror
and
not
my
own
then
she
went
alone
to
her
rooms
through
the
vast
corridors
and
stood
before
the
long
mirrors
which
were
not
magic
but
only
meant
to
reflect
earthly
vanities
and
from
the
shining
marble
floor
came
up
a
kind
of
radiance
about
her
she
opened
the
cedar
doors
of
the
wardrobes
and
there
issued
a
scent
as
of
costly
silk
that
has
been
perfumed
with
iris
root
the
temptation
was
heavy
upon
her
to
clothe
herself
delicately
that
she
might
please
merlin
and
never
before
had
beautiful
clothes
seemed
so
wonderful
to
her
she
ran
her
long
white
fingers
through
the
folds
of
silk
and
let
the
laces
cascade
over
her
arms
but
in
the
end
she
changed
only
her
wooden
shoes
for
little
dancing
slippers
of
violet
velvet
and
again
she
put
fresh
violets
in
her
hair
when
she
entered
the
banquet
hall
she
found
the
king
on
the
dais
and
on
one
side
of
him
stood
prince
hugh
in
a
dancing
dress
and
on
the
other
prince
richard
in
a
garb
of
yellow
velvet
both
wore
jeweled
girdles
to
which
were
attached
little
shining
swords
with
opals
in
the
hilts
about
the
throne
were
grouped
the
courtiers
and
beyond
the
courtiers
were
the
knights
and
ladies
of
the
frescoed
walls
which
bore
the
history
of
king
cuthbert
ancestors
girls
like
drifting
blossoms
matrons
like
sweet
fruit
and
knights
like
strong
trees
the
white
velvet
curtains
before
the
tall
casements
shut
out
the
stars
but
all
the
heavens
seemed
recorded
by
the
glowing
down
the
center
of
the
room
ran
the
with
dishes
of
gold
and
plumage
of
rare
birds
nesting
strange
viands
and
the
sweet
cheeks
of
summer
fruits
showing
through
the
heaped
blossoms
of
rose
gardenia
and
honeysuckle
there
were
sweetmeats
on
dishes
of
pierced
silver
and
between
these
played
into
broad
glass
bowls
jets
of
scented
water
making
a
lake
where
tiny
swans
swam
but
all
this
beauty
was
nothing
to
princess
myrtle
because
she
did
not
see
prince
merlin
in
the
room
nor
at
the
banquet
did
he
appear
so
she
could
eat
but
a
little
fruit
and
that
was
without
taste
to
her
after
the
banquet
the
court
repaired
to
the
where
already
the
musicians
were
strumming
upon
their
instruments
so
that
feet
began
to
move
rhythmically
then
king
cuthbert
beckoned
the
princess
myrtle
to
him
and
said
i
see
that
you
have
put
on
with
whom
will
you
dance
with
myself
sire
should
i
have
no
partner
she
replied
smiling
at
that
moment
prince
merlin
approached
the
throne
clothed
all
in
black
silk
more
appropriate
for
a
scene
of
mourning
than
of
festivity
and
the
king
said
to
him
wilt
thou
lead
this
in
the
dance
the
prince
face
grew
as
white
for
a
moment
as
the
lace
of
his
collar
but
he
replied
proudly
at
a
ball
a
man
chooses
his
own
partners
then
the
princess
myrtle
heart
felt
as
weary
as
feet
on
a
long
road
but
she
awaited
patiently
the
king
next
word
which
was
spoken
to
prince
richard
and
prince
hugh
inviting
them
to
dance
with
the
each
made
an
excuse
then
king
cuthbert
addressed
her
dance
with
yourself
and
he
had
the
heralds
proclaim
that
this
stranger
who
wore
brown
wool
in
court
would
go
on
the
floor
alone
everyone
laughed
and
clapped
their
hands
only
prince
merlin
bit
his
lip
and
looked
prouder
than
ever
which
when
she
saw
the
princess
myrtle
thought
i
will
dance
so
beautifully
that
he
will
ask
me
to
be
his
partner
then
she
let
down
her
hair
from
beneath
her
crown
of
flowers
and
went
into
the
center
of
the
circle
that
the
court
had
formed
and
began
to
sway
a
little
like
a
flower
in
the
breeze
soon
the
court
found
itself
swaying
with
her
so
that
it
was
like
a
garden
when
the
wind
rises
but
when
all
were
moving
the
princess
saw
that
prince
merlin
stood
like
a
that
will
not
bend
its
head
unless
the
tempest
comes
out
of
the
north
so
she
changed
from
a
flower
to
a
butterfly
and
began
a
fluttering
glancing
motion
and
threw
back
her
golden
locks
like
wings
everyone
watching
her
became
very
still
only
prince
merlin
moved
restlessly
and
once
he
put
his
hand
across
his
eyes
as
if
the
sun
were
in
them
when
she
had
finished
the
king
cried
bravo
and
then
the
court
crowded
about
her
and
prince
hugh
and
prince
richard
asked
her
to
dance
with
them
but
prince
merlin
did
not
ask
her
though
he
led
out
many
ladies
and
because
of
that
it
was
as
if
she
were
dancing
in
the
snow
and
rain
or
on
sharp
stones
the
pain
in
her
heart
grew
violent
and
drove
her
at
last
to
the
near
which
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
its
marble
tub
she
sat
down
to
rest
and
all
at
once
a
golden
orange
dropped
in
her
lap
she
held
it
out
to
him
you
have
drowned
your
scarlet
ball
take
this
nay
for
it
is
perishable
he
said
then
tears
like
pearls
came
slowly
from
her
eyes
and
she
was
driven
to
say
you
alone
have
not
asked
me
to
dance
did
not
my
dancing
please
you
he
replied
i
am
not
like
my
brothers
and
he
bowed
and
left
her
that
night
she
lay
on
her
broad
bed
beneath
silken
covers
and
sobbed
bitterly
because
her
heart
told
her
that
prince
merlin
was
noble
yet
her
memory
stung
her
with
his
cold
words
and
averted
eyes
soon
the
third
day
would
be
over
and
she
would
have
to
leave
the
court
for
even
if
king
cuthbert
acknowledged
that
she
was
a
princess
what
did
that
matter
if
merlin
did
not
know
that
she
was
his
queen
all
next
day
she
sat
on
the
terrace
which
looks
seaward
and
counted
the
sails
coming
up
over
the
horizon
like
white
petals
blown
from
an
invisible
garden
and
she
would
say
if
five
come
within
a
space
of
half
an
hour
there
will
be
hope
for
me
but
she
always
lost
count
in
thinking
of
his
face
that
night
she
took
off
her
woolen
dress
and
she
clothed
herself
in
laces
and
over
the
laces
she
put
on
a
cream
silk
gown
all
woven
with
apple
blossoms
and
she
placed
flowers
upon
her
hair
then
flashed
before
the
mirror
and
smiled
to
see
herself
so
beautiful
surely
she
thought
he
will
not
turn
from
me
then
she
put
on
her
and
went
down
when
she
entered
the
banquet
hall
there
was
a
stir
and
a
murmur
and
even
king
cuthbert
was
silent
with
amazement
over
her
beauty
prince
hugh
and
prince
richard
came
forward
to
meet
her
and
they
bowed
low
and
looked
very
noble
indeed
our
father
has
played
a
merry
jest
upon
us
they
said
you
are
indeed
a
princess
and
no
then
they
began
to
dispute
which
should
take
her
in
to
dinner
but
her
eyes
were
all
for
prince
merlin
who
when
the
courtiers
crowded
about
her
and
proclaimed
her
a
princess
looked
straight
away
from
her
this
was
as
a
little
sword
in
her
heart
but
the
grief
that
dimmed
her
eyes
made
her
appear
even
more
beautiful
after
the
banquet
all
proceeded
to
the
and
king
cuthbert
gave
his
arm
to
her
now
i
know
thou
art
the
princess
myrtle
which
of
my
sons
hast
thou
chosen
a
woman
is
chosen
she
does
not
choose
she
replied
for
her
heart
was
heavy
i
must
leave
your
court
wilt
thou
continue
thy
search
princess
myrtle
the
king
said
anxiously
no
i
will
return
to
my
kingdom
and
what
wilt
thou
do
there
i
will
weep
she
answered
she
danced
a
measure
with
prince
hugh
and
a
measure
with
prince
richard
then
she
saw
that
though
prince
merlin
was
in
white
satin
and
gold
he
did
not
dance
but
stood
alone
by
the
when
she
was
free
she
sent
a
herald
to
fetch
him
for
now
she
desired
no
longer
to
play
a
part
but
to
be
herself
he
came
slowly
to
where
she
stood
and
bowed
before
her
in
silence
tell
me
prince
merlin
she
said
if
you
agree
with
these
courtiers
that
i
am
become
a
princess
i
do
not
agree
with
them
he
answered
clothes
do
not
make
a
princess
then
they
looked
at
each
other
will
you
meet
me
she
said
on
the
edge
of
the
wild
forest
in
half
an
hour
time
i
am
your
servant
he
replied
she
stole
away
to
her
rooms
where
the
moonlight
lay
athwart
the
tessellated
marble
floor
and
opened
the
casement
and
placed
the
lamp
there
which
was
to
be
the
signal
for
her
attendants
to
have
her
horses
ready
on
the
edge
of
the
wild
forest
then
she
put
on
the
gown
she
had
worn
as
a
and
her
wooden
shoes
and
let
her
hair
down
over
her
shoulders
the
way
to
the
wild
forest
was
haunted
with
shadows
and
little
fleeing
things
and
the
called
but
she
remembered
the
look
in
merlin
eyes
and
conquered
her
fears
and
there
he
was
waiting
with
the
moonlight
gleaming
on
his
white
satin
and
his
face
turned
to
the
path
up
which
she
came
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
the
blue
velvet
glove
upon
it
and
she
said
softly
will
you
look
into
my
mirror
prince
merlin
i
am
your
servant
he
said
again
then
looked
his
eyes
became
full
of
light
i
see
your
face
he
cried
and
sank
upon
one
knee
she
gave
him
both
her
hands
what
am
i
to
you
she
asked
a
princess
no
he
whispered
a
no
he
whispered
what
then
thou
art
my
love
then
all
the
birds
in
all
the
world
sang
in
her
heart
tell
me
she
said
why
then
didst
thou
sink
thy
ball
that
no
hands
should
ever
touch
it
after
thine
and
why
didst
thou
say
when
thou
didst
lead
me
in
to
dinner
that
thou
wast
sorry
not
for
me
but
for
thyself
i
feared
that
thou
wouldst
never
love
me
then
she
laughed
joyfully
and
asked
why
didst
thou
say
am
not
like
my
brothers
when
i
asked
thee
to
dance
i
wanted
thee
for
thyself
not
for
thy
dancing
and
now
the
stars
moved
all
to
nuptial
music
one
question
more
she
cried
why
didst
thou
say
do
not
make
a
princess
because
i
knew
thou
wast
a
princess
the
first
hour
i
saw
thee
rise
up
my
prince
she
said
we
have
a
long
journey
before
us
i
hear
the
neighing
of
horses
he
said
and
the
moving
of
feet
my
attendants
she
replied
my
rides
with
them
she
gave
me
the
blue
glove
and
told
me
he
should
be
my
husband
who
should
see
not
his
own
face
in
the
mirror
but
mine
i
see
thy
face
everywhere
cried
prince
merlin
so
he
kissed
her
and
they
rode
away
with
all
her
train
through
the
sighing
and
beneath
the
summer
stars
to
the
land
of
their
joy
the
invisible
wall
on
the
edge
of
the
dark
wood
dwelt
for
a
time
a
wizard
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
the
acquirement
of
many
wonderful
arts
as
a
young
man
he
had
wandered
over
europe
from
university
to
university
until
one
day
he
became
aware
of
the
true
secret
of
education
and
burnt
his
books
then
he
dwelt
for
many
years
in
the
mountains
gazing
into
the
dark
mirror
of
his
heart
plumbing
the
blue
ocean
of
the
sky
until
the
hour
for
which
he
longed
arrived
bringing
wisdom
who
appeared
to
him
as
a
young
fair
being
in
the
twilight
leaving
his
hut
he
came
forth
to
meet
her
i
had
thought
to
greet
you
at
noonday
said
he
that
is
because
you
live
in
an
age
which
thinks
that
to
know
is
to
be
wise
but
only
those
see
who
shut
their
eyes
not
in
the
glare
of
noon
but
at
twilight
will
you
find
me
you
are
a
beautiful
maid
wisdom
said
he
who
was
on
his
way
to
be
a
wizard
but
why
do
you
wear
coarse
linen
who
should
be
clothed
in
satins
to
travel
light
she
replied
and
why
do
you
smile
who
should
look
sad
to
be
wise
is
to
be
happy
and
what
will
you
have
me
do
remove
from
here
to
the
village
that
is
near
the
dark
wood
go
through
all
the
countryside
proclaiming
that
king
theophile
will
shortly
make
war
upon
the
inhabitants
but
bid
them
feel
no
terror
only
they
are
to
build
an
invisible
wall
by
the
books
that
i
burned
that
is
a
strange
command
cried
the
wizard
of
what
materials
is
this
wonderful
wall
to
be
built
of
their
sacrifices
their
renouncements
their
good
deeds
replied
wisdom
but
they
will
call
me
mad
cried
the
wizard
wisdom
smiled
did
you
expect
to
be
really
wise
and
yet
thought
sane
she
made
answer
have
the
courage
of
all
great
follies
and
you
will
yet
save
the
kingdom
of
the
dark
wood
which
is
the
fairland
of
the
princess
myrtle
upon
which
the
wizard
took
heart
for
he
knew
that
to
be
fearless
is
to
be
in
the
class
of
masters
and
to
be
fearful
is
to
be
in
the
class
of
slaves
and
the
whole
world
is
divided
into
these
two
classes
nor
is
there
other
aristocracy
or
dependency
sweet
wisdom
i
will
play
the
fool
for
your
sake
he
answered
then
she
smiled
and
blessed
him
and
vanished
into
the
shadows
of
the
forest
the
wizard
was
not
of
those
who
say
i
will
do
thus
and
thus
but
being
truly
wise
he
put
all
his
power
into
the
present
moment
so
he
took
his
flask
of
water
and
his
loaf
of
bread
for
like
wisdom
he
would
travel
light
and
he
set
forth
for
the
kingdom
of
the
dark
wood
there
he
rented
a
little
cottage
in
the
village
near
the
wood
and
set
up
a
shoemaker
bench
for
he
knew
how
to
make
shoes
and
good
ones
too
being
a
wizard
he
knew
that
if
he
showed
people
he
could
do
one
thing
well
they
would
be
the
more
ready
to
listen
to
his
words
a
fine
comfortable
shoe
is
a
wonderful
argument
so
the
wizard
set
to
work
the
dewy
dawns
found
him
at
his
bench
and
when
the
air
at
evening
was
full
of
heliotrope
mists
and
homeward
flying
birds
his
little
candle
burned
yellow
to
light
his
labors
soon
all
the
inhabitants
had
comfortable
which
put
them
all
in
fine
humor
then
the
wizard
began
to
proclaim
a
great
war
and
the
coming
of
king
theophile
he
stood
on
the
green
near
the
and
at
first
only
the
geese
listened
to
him
stretching
out
their
long
necks
and
opening
their
red
bills
but
this
did
not
discourage
the
wizard
for
he
knew
that
after
geese
come
men
illustration
the
wizard
first
audience
what
this
what
this
cried
the
tailor
who
was
the
first
to
get
the
message
a
war
i
must
run
right
home
and
polish
up
my
old
gun
nay
said
the
wizard
but
go
home
and
kiss
your
wife
for
you
kissed
her
in
five
years
if
she
would
comb
her
hair
and
look
attractive
i
might
kiss
her
growled
the
tailor
if
you
buy
her
a
ribbon
occasionally
advised
the
wizard
she
might
have
the
desire
to
make
herself
look
pretty
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
war
inquired
the
tailor
your
kiss
will
make
a
stone
in
the
invisible
wall
which
is
to
keep
out
the
enemy
the
wizard
answered
and
if
you
stop
your
everlasting
work
and
take
your
poor
wife
on
an
outing
that
will
be
another
stone
every
sacrifice
you
make
every
good
deed
you
do
will
be
a
guarding
stone
in
the
wall
the
tailor
rubbed
his
ear
am
i
crazy
or
are
you
am
i
asking
you
to
do
much
for
your
country
demanded
the
wizard
think
how
mean
you
would
feel
if
the
invisible
wall
got
built
without
one
stone
of
your
donating
i
go
right
home
and
kiss
matilda
said
the
tailor
with
a
skip
and
off
he
ran
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
back
again
she
blushed
so
and
looked
so
pretty
and
pleased
that
i
kissed
her
three
times
and
we
are
going
to
see
her
mother
put
me
down
for
four
stones
good
said
the
wizard
by
this
time
quite
a
crowd
had
collected
all
anxious
to
hear
about
the
war
a
rich
miller
took
the
news
very
seriously
because
his
mills
lay
to
the
eastward
from
which
horizon
king
theophile
would
appear
he
sent
to
the
bank
for
bags
of
gold
and
laid
them
at
the
feet
of
the
wizard
these
will
buy
much
gunpowder
he
said
the
wall
will
never
be
built
of
gold
replied
the
wizard
there
is
no
gold
minted
that
will
overcome
an
enemy
or
keep
him
out
if
he
wants
to
get
in
or
put
mercy
into
his
heart
when
vengeance
is
flaming
there
the
real
weapons
are
unseen
if
you
wish
to
help
build
the
invisible
wall
stop
grinding
the
faces
of
the
poor
and
charging
famine
prices
for
your
grain
then
the
miller
grew
red
in
the
face
and
took
up
his
bags
of
gold
and
went
away
but
next
day
everyone
bought
wheat
at
a
lower
price
than
it
had
been
for
many
a
long
year
so
that
people
knew
the
wizard
words
had
taken
effect
this
made
him
very
popular
and
when
he
again
proclaimed
the
danger
of
war
and
the
necessity
of
building
an
invisible
wall
nearly
all
the
village
came
forward
to
ask
him
what
they
could
do
to
insure
a
stone
in
that
guarding
structure
some
of
them
whispered
in
his
ear
because
they
hated
to
have
their
secret
faults
proclaimed
to
their
neighbors
old
peter
was
among
those
who
made
inquiry
as
to
what
sacrifice
they
should
offer
to
avert
the
threatening
danger
i
have
said
he
a
pet
bird
that
pines
in
his
cage
if
i
give
him
his
liberty
will
that
help
build
up
the
wall
yes
peter
said
the
wizard
for
no
good
man
keeps
anything
captive
that
has
the
desire
for
freedom
some
people
paid
their
debts
to
help
build
the
wall
others
began
to
go
to
church
after
staying
away
for
years
and
years
others
made
up
quarrels
with
their
relatives
and
friends
and
these
stones
of
reconciliation
were
the
wizard
proclaimed
the
strongest
of
all
since
unity
and
love
are
the
only
impregnable
fortresses
of
course
there
was
some
doubt
about
the
wall
since
nobody
could
prove
that
it
really
existed
but
the
wizard
declared
he
saw
it
to
the
eastward
growing
ever
stronger
and
wider
and
he
traveled
up
and
down
the
land
prophesying
war
and
the
necessity
of
making
the
invisible
wall
strong
and
high
by
good
works
he
met
with
greatest
success
in
the
villages
and
towns
but
when
he
entered
the
region
of
the
high
castles
where
the
knights
and
ladies
dwelt
he
was
much
laughed
at
and
some
would
have
had
him
locked
up
at
once
now
being
a
wizard
he
knew
how
powerful
fashion
is
in
this
world
and
how
a
wandering
breath
may
bring
it
into
being
so
he
said
to
himself
i
will
go
direct
to
the
court
of
the
princess
myrtle
who
has
married
the
prince
merlin
and
will
gain
her
ear
when
she
knows
the
invisible
wall
is
to
protect
her
kingdom
she
will
be
gracious
and
set
the
fashion
of
providing
stones
so
he
journeyed
all
day
and
all
night
and
came
at
last
to
the
grim
city
of
green
stones
with
towers
like
aged
fingers
of
gnarled
wood
in
the
midst
of
which
the
princess
myrtle
held
her
court
in
an
old
red
castle
set
about
with
small
stiff
trees
now
the
princess
had
not
long
been
married
to
the
prince
merlin
so
full
of
love
were
they
for
each
other
that
for
them
many
days
had
drifted
away
like
the
dreams
of
a
night
and
so
sweet
was
their
converse
and
so
softly
the
minstrels
sang
that
all
the
court
lived
in
a
kind
of
trance
the
day
the
wizard
reached
the
castle
it
was
drowsy
noon
and
the
curtains
were
softly
swaying
in
the
breeze
while
upon
the
dim
walls
the
greenish
tapestries
looked
like
mysterious
forests
the
prince
and
princess
sat
upon
their
thrones
like
painted
figures
and
all
around
them
sat
their
courtiers
in
their
golden
dreams
while
the
minstrels
sang
the
waves
are
beating
on
the
yellow
sands
the
moon
in
a
black
vault
rides
white
and
high
let
us
go
forth
from
these
most
desolate
lands
led
by
the
spirit
cry
you
are
quite
right
said
the
wizard
your
lands
will
be
desolate
unless
you
help
build
the
invisible
wall
at
that
all
the
courtiers
whose
eyelids
had
been
drooping
with
the
summer
heat
and
with
dreams
of
romance
looked
up
and
the
princess
myrtle
withdrew
her
gaze
from
prince
merlin
and
fastened
her
sweet
eyes
upon
the
wizard
you
must
not
care
what
the
minstrels
sing
she
said
we
are
all
so
happy
here
that
we
love
songs
of
sorrow
sweet
princess
said
the
wizard
king
theophile
intends
to
make
war
upon
you
and
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
already
your
subjects
have
built
a
fine
invisible
wall
of
good
deeds
and
sacrifices
but
they
must
not
perform
all
the
labor
and
have
all
the
pain
while
the
nobles
jest
and
feast
for
the
wall
must
have
a
stone
in
it
from
every
kind
of
man
rich
or
poor
high
or
low
else
it
will
not
endure
and
you
the
princess
must
put
in
the
strongest
stone
of
all
since
the
ruler
of
a
country
must
be
its
protector
all
the
courtiers
smiled
at
this
but
the
princess
did
not
smile
because
she
was
as
wise
as
she
was
fair
she
looked
down
at
her
robe
of
satin
and
her
little
slippers
embroidered
with
and
she
drew
a
rose
from
the
jade
bowl
near
her
throne
to
pass
back
and
forth
across
her
lips
as
was
her
manner
when
thinking
prince
merlin
she
said
at
last
if
this
strange
tale
be
true
what
stone
wilt
thou
place
in
the
invisible
wall
i
will
go
for
a
month
to
the
council
chamber
instead
of
lingering
near
thee
while
the
minstrels
sing
replied
her
husband
spoken
like
a
prince
cried
the
wizard
and
what
wilt
thou
do
princess
i
will
go
to
the
council
chamber
with
milord
she
answered
and
read
most
heavy
papers
of
state
for
if
he
shares
my
play
i
must
share
his
work
to
attend
to
the
duties
of
sovereignty
instead
of
listening
to
minstrels
in
a
scented
room
is
a
fitting
stone
for
the
princess
to
place
in
the
invisible
wall
commented
the
wizard
then
he
looked
around
at
the
courtiers
now
after
the
manner
of
courtiers
they
wanted
to
imitate
their
prince
and
princess
but
they
thought
this
invisible
wall
a
great
joke
not
worth
making
sacrifices
for
the
wizard
read
their
thoughts
and
said
to
them
if
the
ruler
works
alone
he
is
like
a
bird
with
a
crippled
wing
he
can
only
rule
wisely
and
well
if
all
the
wisest
and
best
help
him
you
are
placed
high
that
you
may
serve
give
me
each
his
vow
of
sacrifice
that
the
wall
may
be
strong
the
knights
and
nobles
looked
at
each
other
then
at
the
princess
myrtle
and
she
bowed
her
head
and
thus
addressed
them
if
our
weapons
against
an
enemy
must
be
our
unity
our
mutual
love
and
service
instead
of
roaring
guns
and
flaming
cannon
surely
it
is
easy
to
provide
them
nevertheless
she
added
turning
to
the
military
commander
see
that
the
army
is
made
ready
the
wizard
smiled
well
and
good
if
you
remember
dear
princess
that
an
army
can
never
be
greater
or
stronger
than
the
nation
back
of
it
for
every
gun
manufactured
there
must
be
a
noble
desire
forged
or
a
high
ideal
realized
or
else
the
weapons
will
be
but
a
mask
of
courage
on
a
weak
face
the
military
commander
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
go
and
see
if
the
gunpowder
is
dry
he
commented
as
my
contribution
to
yon
invisible
wall
then
one
by
one
the
nobles
at
the
command
of
the
princess
myrtle
came
forward
to
register
each
his
vow
of
sacrifice
one
said
that
he
would
write
no
more
poetry
for
a
year
another
that
he
would
eat
no
truffles
for
a
fortnight
a
third
proclaimed
that
he
would
sell
his
jeweled
sword
to
buy
bread
for
the
poor
the
wizard
listened
and
shook
his
head
this
layer
of
stones
is
going
to
be
very
weak
he
said
why
do
you
all
stop
and
think
while
the
ladies
make
their
vows
the
crowded
forward
like
a
of
flowers
eager
to
do
better
than
the
knights
in
the
construction
of
this
invisible
wall
for
being
women
they
were
quicker
than
their
brothers
and
husbands
to
understand
what
the
wizard
meant
yet
they
too
were
not
quite
clear
in
their
minds
for
one
said
she
would
wear
linen
instead
of
satin
another
that
she
would
give
up
perfumes
for
six
months
another
that
she
would
read
no
novels
for
that
time
the
wizard
began
to
look
discouraged
at
last
a
beautiful
young
girl
came
forward
to
register
her
vow
i
do
care
enough
about
jewels
and
scents
and
satins
to
give
them
up
sir
stranger
she
said
but
i
should
like
to
win
the
love
of
the
poor
so
i
will
visit
them
and
be
as
one
of
them
at
this
the
wizard
clapped
his
hands
this
stone
is
most
strong
he
said
now
sir
knights
return
and
make
new
vows
then
the
knights
came
forward
i
will
be
reconciled
with
my
brother
said
one
i
will
build
a
new
cottage
for
an
aged
tenant
proclaimed
another
while
a
third
who
was
in
love
with
the
beautiful
girl
who
wanted
the
love
of
the
poor
said
i
will
make
a
great
supper
for
the
hungry
and
will
feast
with
them
ah
cried
the
wizard
that
will
be
indeed
a
great
feast
the
bread
of
charity
chokes
the
receiver
because
the
hand
that
gives
it
will
not
break
it
with
him
we
must
have
communion
not
patronage
or
the
invisible
wall
will
never
be
built
the
princess
myrtle
listened
as
one
who
hears
a
new
gospel
and
she
remembered
that
she
had
never
broken
bread
with
the
poor
but
only
bestowed
benefits
upon
them
which
is
no
way
to
become
acquainted
and
she
sighed
a
little
sigh
of
love
and
regret
and
hope
of
doing
better
which
the
wizard
said
afterwards
became
one
of
the
strongest
stones
in
the
invisible
wall
such
a
change
in
the
kingdom
people
making
up
quarrels
that
had
withered
hearts
for
generations
court
ladies
running
with
warm
loaves
to
the
cottages
and
staying
to
eat
some
of
the
bread
knights
helping
old
men
with
the
harvest
minstrels
sent
to
sing
to
the
bedridden
instead
of
to
an
assemblage
of
bored
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
a
tapestried
gallery
much
less
talk
of
love
and
many
more
loving
deeds
people
wild
to
serve
each
other
instead
of
themselves
all
the
land
silent
and
helpful
instead
of
chattering
and
selfish
such
a
change
in
the
kingdom
the
wizard
was
everywhere
for
the
wall
was
beginning
to
be
a
real
defense
and
he
spared
no
pains
to
see
that
every
stone
was
strong
now
the
fame
of
this
wall
reached
king
theophile
for
this
was
in
the
days
of
his
warring
and
he
laughed
on
his
throne
and
said
oh
little
nation
i
will
make
mincemeat
of
thee
for
i
have
every
kind
of
weapon
that
is
made
and
many
officials
who
do
nothing
all
day
but
spy
on
other
people
and
brandish
their
swords
what
have
you
to
oppose
to
such
strength
little
kingdom
you
will
be
but
a
road
to
my
glory
so
he
made
great
preparations
for
war
and
gathered
together
all
the
weapons
that
shed
blood
there
were
many
of
these
and
he
prided
himself
upon
them
but
in
all
his
arsenal
was
not
one
instrument
that
could
put
shed
blood
back
again
into
the
veins
of
a
man
which
shows
that
ironworkers
do
not
know
everything
one
fine
day
the
king
and
all
his
armies
came
across
the
rocking
waves
and
drove
their
boats
upon
the
shores
of
the
kingdom
of
the
dark
wood
which
lay
fair
before
them
like
a
green
and
purple
map
edged
with
white
where
the
breakers
drove
high
the
land
wind
brought
to
their
senses
the
odors
of
grapes
and
the
scent
of
apples
and
ripe
grain
and
the
soldiers
said
to
each
other
we
will
kill
then
we
will
feast
they
were
impatient
to
overrun
the
land
now
the
reported
that
but
a
small
army
had
massed
to
meet
the
intruders
and
that
back
of
their
ranks
the
inhabitants
were
peacefully
at
work
gathering
in
the
harvest
this
seemed
incredible
then
king
theophile
gave
his
command
to
the
army
march
forward
and
to
the
fly
on
and
drop
burning
brands
on
the
fields
the
army
immediately
set
out
far
away
the
were
seen
beating
the
air
like
black
rooks
but
strangely
enough
they
always
remained
in
sight
and
seemed
to
get
no
further
at
last
they
went
high
up
into
the
clouds
and
disappeared
but
the
soldiers
pressed
on
joyfully
for
the
sweet
odors
of
vineyard
and
garden
grew
ever
more
ravishing
and
now
the
land
lay
at
their
feet
in
a
shimmering
haze
through
which
the
forests
rose
like
deep
cool
islands
with
here
and
there
a
red
roof
or
a
white
church
spire
to
tell
of
human
habitation
and
up
through
the
haze
like
released
spirits
in
paradise
came
with
soft
steady
motion
phalanxes
of
soldiers
smiling
by
my
sword
that
never
sleeps
cried
king
theophile
their
faces
shall
be
gray
ere
nightfall
and
they
shall
smile
no
more
then
all
his
soldiers
made
their
swords
sing
and
flash
like
waving
grain
of
death
and
they
chanted
together
a
song
without
joy
suddenly
the
black
dam
of
their
war
fury
broke
and
with
the
wild
roar
of
an
untamed
cataract
they
swept
forward
towards
these
still
and
smiling
knights
with
king
theophile
on
a
high
dark
horse
at
their
head
in
his
rage
of
conquest
he
dug
his
golden
spurs
into
his
horse
side
and
the
beast
with
quivering
nostrils
leaped
through
space
then
suddenly
paused
quivering
nor
could
cry
or
whip
or
spur
move
him
then
king
theophile
leaped
down
and
rushed
forward
to
see
what
was
frightening
the
animal
and
all
at
once
he
crashed
against
something
hard
and
his
broken
right
arm
fell
to
his
side
he
grew
gray
not
with
pain
but
with
sheer
terror
for
he
could
see
nothing
yet
his
arm
had
been
broken
upon
a
substance
that
felt
like
granite
as
he
gazed
wildly
about
him
he
saw
the
first
phalanx
of
his
army
pitch
back
with
bleeding
foreheads
and
their
eyes
rolled
in
amazement
for
they
could
see
nothing
yet
they
had
driven
themselves
against
stones
on
on
cried
king
theophile
for
he
trusted
again
to
his
senses
which
revealed
only
a
peaceful
landscape
and
in
the
distance
haloed
with
the
mists
a
calm
army
waiting
and
smiling
that
smile
of
the
foe
was
like
poison
in
the
king
veins
and
again
he
rushed
forward
this
time
to
bruise
and
cut
his
head
so
that
the
blood
poured
over
his
white
mantle
then
he
grew
faint
with
fear
as
he
beheld
his
soldiers
clawing
the
empty
airs
and
turning
countenances
to
him
sire
they
whispered
something
is
holding
us
back
something
is
here
that
we
do
not
see
at
that
moment
the
dropped
to
the
ground
like
tired
birds
the
wind
holds
us
back
cried
one
no
exclaimed
another
we
broke
our
machines
against
a
wall
miles
in
the
air
this
is
a
bewitched
country
we
will
wait
and
try
again
said
king
theophile
so
they
encamped
on
the
spot
and
far
off
in
the
haze
they
saw
the
other
army
pitch
its
tents
and
they
heard
the
soldiers
singing
all
night
their
banners
waved
in
the
wind
and
the
faint
music
continued
at
dawn
king
theophile
army
was
astir
and
those
whose
vehicles
were
still
unbroken
began
their
flight
violently
and
were
as
violently
pitched
back
the
phalanxes
were
ordered
to
advance
but
some
fell
dead
with
horror
as
they
drove
their
limbs
against
an
unseen
barrier
for
the
limpid
air
revealed
only
the
placid
fields
and
in
the
distance
among
the
golden
shadows
men
smiling
like
the
still
saints
in
paradisal
meadows
these
be
happy
warriors
sighed
the
king
and
for
once
in
his
life
he
longed
to
call
the
foe
brother
and
ask
how
the
harvest
went
and
to
pillow
his
head
on
the
same
knapsack
with
a
soldier
and
so
sleep
sweet
and
brotherly
but
the
wall
which
shut
out
his
hate
now
shut
out
also
his
love
so
that
he
could
not
walk
across
the
fields
and
embrace
those
smiling
warriors
waiting
in
the
sunshine
for
a
battle
that
was
never
to
take
place
so
sadly
one
day
he
turned
his
army
back
to
the
and
the
rocking
boats
and
away
from
the
vision
of
calm
eyes
gazing
at
him
through
golden
shadows
where
the
land
lay
fair
and
open
now
when
the
last
of
the
fleet
had
disappeared
below
the
horizon
the
people
of
the
dark
wood
kingdom
went
mad
with
joy
and
the
wizard
was
escorted
to
the
palace
by
all
the
army
the
princess
myrtle
and
prince
merlin
met
him
at
the
entrance
to
the
and
pages
scattered
flowers
beneath
his
feet
o
wise
man
cried
the
princess
how
shall
we
reward
thee
for
thy
wisdom
only
children
crave
rewards
replied
the
wizard
it
will
be
pleasure
enough
for
me
to
return
to
my
little
hut
and
to
hear
the
woodpeckers
in
the
eaves
and
to
see
the
white
owls
fly
when
the
stars
glow
above
the
dark
forest
branches
now
the
military
commander
was
the
only
person
in
the
kingdom
who
was
not
sharing
the
general
joy
he
was
grumpy
because
he
had
lost
all
the
honor
of
winning
a
bloody
battle
even
the
sight
of
all
his
army
alive
and
well
could
not
soothe
the
wound
to
his
vanity
so
when
the
princess
and
the
wizard
were
exchanging
the
last
courtesies
he
strode
forward
bowed
and
said
your
highness
this
invisible
wall
is
all
very
well
but
how
will
our
people
reach
the
seacoast
through
this
perpetual
barrier
can
this
mighty
wizard
destroy
what
he
has
erected
then
all
the
court
looked
at
the
wizard
who
asked
to
be
led
at
once
to
the
great
concourse
where
the
people
were
assembled
this
is
a
question
to
be
settled
by
the
nation
and
not
by
the
court
he
averred
so
the
knights
and
ladies
moved
like
living
flowers
to
the
concourse
where
the
people
were
assembled
the
pure
grain
of
the
kingdom
and
the
wizard
called
in
a
loud
voice
to
them
men
and
women
is
it
your
will
that
your
good
deeds
be
destroyed
or
remain
in
everlasting
remembrance
for
this
wall
will
never
keep
any
true
soul
from
the
sea
nor
any
honest
man
but
he
that
is
a
rogue
will
beat
in
vain
against
it
then
the
people
shouted
we
will
keep
this
wall
which
we
have
built
with
our
good
deeds
so
the
wall
stood
forever
but
the
wizard
journeyed
home
and
knew
the
joy
of
the
tired
traveler
who
sees
his
own
little
nook
again
that
night
he
ate
his
bread
and
drank
his
draught
of
water
on
his
own
doorstone
and
watched
the
white
owls
fly
hoping
that
wisdom
would
let
him
be
quiet
awhile
in
the
arms
of
the
forest
before
she
sent
him
out
again
to
teach
the
restless
hearts
of
men
the
tree
in
the
dark
wood
in
the
kingdom
of
the
princess
myrtle
were
many
forests
cut
through
with
roaring
streams
which
dashed
and
danced
their
way
over
immense
shining
black
bowlders
that
looked
like
ebony
bears
lying
in
the
current
so
high
were
the
trees
of
these
woods
that
they
shut
out
the
sun
and
he
who
walked
through
them
felt
himself
among
the
columns
of
a
gigantic
temple
in
the
darkest
wood
of
all
people
sometimes
lost
their
way
on
bitter
nights
when
the
white
stars
hung
just
above
the
and
the
filled
the
air
with
the
little
snaps
and
crackles
of
their
orchestra
the
queer
marred
music
of
winter
the
reddening
of
dawn
found
these
poor
adventurers
frozen
unless
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
what
all
the
countryside
knew
as
the
tree
in
the
dark
wood
the
whispers
of
generations
had
established
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
this
tree
since
the
hour
when
the
woodcutter
peter
garland
had
wandered
too
far
into
the
forest
and
had
been
benighted
on
the
feast
of
stephen
when
the
air
sometimes
sings
with
snow
he
had
become
half
paralyzed
with
the
cold
his
poor
lantern
had
gone
out
and
he
was
about
to
say
his
last
prayers
thinking
he
would
never
live
until
morning
when
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
whirling
snow
he
saw
extended
the
limbs
of
a
most
beautiful
tree
it
was
not
so
tall
as
the
others
and
shining
fruit
of
a
delicious
appearance
hung
upon
its
branches
amidst
its
thick
foliage
best
of
all
poor
peter
felt
a
wonderful
warmth
glowing
from
its
trunk
and
with
the
warmth
came
a
soft
crimson
light
so
he
stole
up
to
it
as
if
he
were
a
little
boy
and
this
tree
were
his
beautiful
mother
and
he
cuddled
down
in
the
arms
of
its
great
roots
and
went
to
sleep
when
he
woke
up
it
was
morning
and
the
sun
was
turning
the
surface
of
the
snow
into
sheets
of
iridescent
light
he
yawned
and
stretched
out
his
arms
then
remembering
his
wonderful
rescue
of
the
evening
before
he
gazed
upward
but
saw
only
a
tall
pine
tree
with
shining
brownish
cones
pendant
from
its
branches
where
was
the
beautiful
green
hung
with
crimson
fruit
where
was
the
light
like
the
sun
rays
through
painted
glass
but
here
am
i
alive
and
warm
thought
peter
and
the
night
was
bitter
this
tree
must
change
its
shape
at
the
footfall
of
evening
and
i
will
mark
it
lest
it
should
be
lost
to
us
so
taking
out
his
knife
he
cut
three
crosses
in
the
bark
of
the
tree
then
setting
his
face
to
the
sun
for
his
cottage
lay
to
the
east
of
the
dark
wood
he
hacked
the
trees
all
along
the
way
and
at
last
emerged
in
the
path
which
led
to
his
dwelling
his
wife
and
all
the
neighbors
who
had
given
him
up
for
dead
came
running
to
meet
him
with
cries
of
joy
but
when
he
told
them
what
had
happened
they
tapped
their
foreheads
and
glanced
at
each
other
poor
man
they
said
the
hath
stolen
his
wits
but
i
marked
the
tree
with
three
crosses
he
cried
and
i
can
lead
you
straight
to
it
they
laughed
but
to
humor
him
they
said
he
might
take
them
to
his
wonderful
tree
after
dinner
when
hot
soup
had
given
them
all
courage
so
that
afternoon
there
was
a
long
procession
of
people
trudging
through
the
dark
wood
with
peter
at
their
head
by
the
time
he
arrived
at
the
tree
he
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
with
excitement
there
sure
enough
stood
a
tall
marked
with
the
three
crosses
but
it
was
otherwise
in
no
way
different
from
its
fellows
yes
but
wait
for
evening
then
you
will
see
it
change
said
peter
they
laughed
a
little
and
grumbled
a
little
but
most
of
them
had
filled
their
lanterns
and
brought
bread
and
cheese
against
a
hungry
time
and
after
all
it
was
not
so
cold
in
the
forest
for
the
north
wind
with
his
blue
ballooned
cheeks
could
not
blow
hard
down
those
long
avenues
peter
was
full
of
excitement
for
he
was
sure
that
the
tree
would
become
magical
as
soon
as
the
sun
set
when
the
last
splashes
of
crimson
had
faded
from
the
topmost
boughs
he
began
anxiously
to
watch
the
tree
about
which
all
the
villagers
had
seated
themselves
in
a
circle
after
first
scraping
the
snow
from
the
dead
leaves
darker
and
darker
grew
the
air
and
brighter
the
stars
while
far
off
in
the
forest
the
great
cats
began
to
talk
to
each
other
and
the
owls
hooted
and
flew
suddenly
peter
gave
a
cry
of
joy
see
see
the
wonderful
fruit
the
glowing
leaves
nonsense
said
his
wife
o
poor
loon
he
will
never
be
right
again
and
she
began
to
weep
into
her
apron
it
is
true
it
is
true
cried
another
voice
that
of
bennie
brown
who
supported
an
old
father
and
mother
and
a
crippled
sister
by
his
labors
yes
it
is
the
most
beautiful
tree
said
a
young
girl
who
had
once
sold
her
golden
hair
to
buy
bread
for
a
mother
with
a
child
o
the
wonderful
fruit
the
sweet
warmth
the
others
stared
and
rubbed
their
eyes
and
looked
angry
you
lie
bennie
one
cried
you
are
a
silly
girl
elsa
shrieked
another
they
speak
truth
see
you
not
the
crimson
light
spoke
grave
henry
baird
who
had
rescued
many
from
drowning
in
the
mountain
streams
those
who
did
not
see
grew
more
and
more
furious
crazy
people
they
cried
loons
silly
babblers
will
you
teach
us
then
some
began
to
beat
peter
others
to
belabor
young
elsa
at
which
bennie
ran
to
her
rescue
and
being
as
brave
as
he
was
good
laid
about
him
with
his
fists
and
cried
shame
on
you
to
hurt
a
woman
because
your
own
eyes
are
blind
soon
everyone
was
fighting
but
those
who
saw
the
tree
felt
a
great
strength
in
all
their
limbs
and
warmth
and
joy
so
that
they
soon
escaped
from
the
brawling
disappointed
ones
and
ran
lightly
homeward
with
singing
hearts
but
the
dispute
thus
started
went
on
through
many
months
until
half
the
village
refused
to
speak
to
the
other
half
finally
a
good
old
hermit
traveled
over
the
ridges
of
the
mountains
and
forded
many
streams
to
reach
a
place
which
had
become
famous
by
its
quarrel
he
arrived
in
harvest
time
those
who
knew
that
the
tree
glowed
with
life
were
in
the
fields
quietly
at
work
for
what
had
they
to
trouble
them
who
had
found
the
truth
but
the
others
who
could
not
see
were
leaning
over
each
other
fences
with
their
neglected
gardens
at
their
impatient
heels
and
arguing
and
arguing
the
matter
the
hermit
being
a
wise
man
asked
no
direct
questions
concerning
the
tree
but
went
himself
that
evening
into
the
forest
and
there
beheld
the
miracle
next
day
he
made
friends
with
the
villagers
and
because
warm
words
open
the
heart
soon
the
good
hermit
had
the
life
histories
of
all
the
inhabitants
as
well
as
the
names
of
those
who
had
seen
the
tree
and
those
whose
sight
was
blinded
after
which
he
retired
into
the
wood
to
think
upon
what
he
had
learned
and
to
sort
out
his
people
like
little
colored
beads
what
he
discovered
was
this
that
all
those
who
had
made
sacrifices
for
their
fellows
like
bennie
brown
and
young
elsa
were
able
to
see
the
tree
but
the
selfish
and
the
and
the
indifferent
could
not
behold
it
when
he
was
quite
sure
of
this
he
went
calmly
back
to
the
village
and
calling
together
all
the
inhabitants
he
told
them
exactly
why
some
saw
the
tree
and
why
it
was
hidden
from
the
sight
of
others
these
latter
only
laughed
at
his
words
though
some
of
them
were
cut
to
the
heart
but
they
were
too
proud
to
reveal
the
wound
the
hermit
explanation
however
was
accepted
by
many
and
rumor
carried
it
far
beyond
the
borders
of
the
village
so
that
after
a
while
the
nobility
heard
of
it
and
the
burghers
in
the
walled
towns
where
beautiful
tapestries
were
always
drowsing
into
wonderful
life
on
looms
that
could
weave
dreams
the
result
was
that
it
grew
quite
fashionable
to
journey
to
the
tree
to
make
a
test
of
one
character
as
people
go
to
physicians
to
have
their
blood
examined
in
the
bright
summer
evenings
long
processions
could
be
seen
winding
like
a
varicolored
serpent
among
the
gray
trees
swords
flashed
banners
flew
troubadours
sang
snatches
of
little
lilting
airs
like
the
rise
and
dip
of
birds
wings
and
beautiful
ladies
jingled
the
golden
bridles
of
their
steeds
few
of
these
ladies
brought
their
betrothed
with
them
lest
they
should
be
made
ashamed
by
not
being
able
to
see
the
tree
and
should
thereby
be
discovered
as
possessing
hard
hearts
beneath
their
sweet
manners
it
was
rumored
indeed
that
people
known
to
be
selfish
and
cruel
had
proclaimed
nevertheless
that
they
beheld
a
glorious
tree
so
that
liars
were
made
and
hypocrites
others
said
this
was
but
the
jealousy
of
disappointed
ones
whose
own
lives
had
blurred
their
eyesight
now
in
the
realm
dwelt
a
splendid
young
knight
whose
name
was
sir
godfrey
and
who
took
pleasure
in
all
manner
of
chivalrous
deeds
towards
the
ladies
of
his
own
rank
he
was
tall
and
with
clear
blue
eyes
and
a
fresh
skin
and
when
he
wore
his
golden
armor
he
looked
like
the
pictures
of
george
his
home
was
a
castle
of
aged
stones
held
together
by
a
vast
ivy
vine
and
around
the
castle
was
a
moat
so
deep
that
it
gave
back
a
midnight
darkness
to
the
noon
sky
now
sir
godfrey
was
in
love
with
the
lady
beatrice
whose
lands
adjoined
his
she
was
pale
and
slender
as
any
lily
with
black
heavy
hair
that
had
no
light
in
it
but
in
her
heart
was
much
light
and
because
her
soul
mirrored
more
than
her
eyes
she
did
not
love
easily
which
reluctance
of
hers
was
a
grief
to
sir
godfrey
who
pressed
his
suit
in
vain
one
day
when
the
roses
were
and
all
the
little
lambs
were
skipping
in
the
broad
green
fields
sir
godfrey
rode
on
his
great
white
horse
towards
the
castle
of
the
lady
beatrice
which
was
high
up
on
a
hill
and
faced
the
dawn
and
he
proudly
rode
because
he
saw
that
she
was
watching
him
from
the
but
after
a
while
he
beheld
her
no
more
and
he
thought
she
knows
i
know
she
was
watching
pride
put
a
smile
on
his
lips
because
she
had
never
watched
for
him
before
he
spurred
his
horse
to
reach
her
the
quicker
while
she
was
in
this
mood
now
just
before
he
gained
the
gate
of
the
castle
a
with
her
geese
blocked
the
road
and
he
cried
impatiently
out
of
the
way
out
of
the
way
and
scarcely
reined
in
his
horse
so
that
there
was
danger
of
the
girl
being
hurt
she
was
quick
on
her
feet
however
and
sprang
aside
but
one
poor
bird
was
trampled
under
the
steed
hoofs
at
which
the
girl
gave
a
sob
and
called
out
you
are
wicked
wicked
then
he
put
his
hand
in
his
purse
and
drew
out
some
gold
pieces
and
flung
them
towards
her
but
she
did
not
see
them
for
her
face
was
buried
in
the
down
of
the
bird
which
was
a
pet
when
he
reached
the
gate
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
arch
stood
the
lady
beatrice
her
face
was
as
white
as
a
gardenia
flower
and
she
did
not
smile
when
she
greeted
him
he
wondered
what
he
had
done
to
offend
her
and
after
a
page
had
led
away
his
horse
he
employed
all
his
graceful
arts
to
win
the
smile
he
craved
as
a
thirsty
man
longs
for
water
sometimes
she
glanced
at
him
from
beneath
her
lashes
as
if
seeking
to
read
his
soul
and
once
he
saw
her
lips
tremble
but
the
smile
did
not
come
they
were
pacing
up
and
down
between
the
nodding
roses
that
seemed
to
be
saying
to
sir
godfrey
kiss
her
kiss
her
until
no
longer
could
he
bear
it
and
he
sank
on
one
knee
before
her
and
poured
out
his
heart
she
listened
like
a
maiden
turned
to
snow
then
when
he
was
silent
she
spoke
thus
to
him
will
you
go
with
me
and
my
ladies
to
the
tree
in
the
dark
wood
this
very
night
if
you
can
behold
the
tree
filled
with
fruit
and
rosy
flame
i
will
marry
you
if
not
i
can
not
be
your
bride
but
you
must
promise
me
upon
the
of
your
sword
that
you
will
speak
truthfully
you
must
not
deceive
me
to
gain
my
hand
then
sir
godfrey
gave
his
word
joyfully
for
he
was
sure
that
he
would
behold
the
magical
tree
he
thought
of
all
his
noble
deeds
and
the
beautiful
ladies
for
whose
sake
he
had
tilted
in
tourney
and
of
all
his
prowess
as
a
knight
in
king
courts
so
when
the
sun
was
low
he
with
lady
beatrice
and
her
train
of
ladies
rode
forth
from
the
gates
towards
the
dark
wood
which
lay
like
a
cloud
in
the
distance
and
sir
godfrey
was
full
of
song
and
jest
for
he
never
doubted
that
soon
he
would
be
the
betrothed
of
his
beautiful
lady
but
she
was
silent
and
looked
often
towards
the
west
where
the
rosy
clouds
slept
when
the
procession
entered
the
wood
it
was
as
if
the
gray
spaces
had
turned
all
at
once
into
a
garden
flashes
of
jewels
and
silks
threw
magic
colors
on
the
twilight
and
the
troubadours
in
the
train
sang
so
sweetly
that
all
the
birds
were
mute
as
night
came
on
the
pretty
little
lanterns
were
lit
and
swung
at
the
horses
bridles
the
tree
was
nearly
reached
when
lady
beatrice
halted
her
procession
and
bade
it
await
her
and
sir
godfrey
for
she
loved
him
too
well
to
have
him
mortified
before
other
people
and
she
feared
that
he
would
not
behold
the
glowing
tree
but
never
a
doubt
crossed
his
mind
for
he
remembered
all
his
noble
deeds
that
he
had
performed
beneath
the
eyes
of
gallant
knights
and
fair
ladies
so
they
rode
on
to
the
tree
and
he
unhooked
the
lantern
from
his
saddle
and
held
it
high
why
do
you
do
that
asked
the
lady
beatrice
to
find
the
three
crosses
he
said
but
the
tree
is
glowing
like
a
jewel
she
cried
then
he
grew
gray
as
the
ashes
of
a
fire
for
he
knew
that
he
had
failed
and
his
pride
suffered
a
mortal
wound
since
it
was
greater
than
his
love
you
are
deceived
lady
beatrice
like
all
the
rest
he
said
there
is
no
magic
tree
for
answer
she
turned
her
horse
and
rode
sadly
away
her
heart
was
too
heavy
for
speech
as
he
saw
her
going
the
sense
of
loss
cut
like
a
knife
into
his
spirit
and
his
pain
was
keen
for
he
still
loved
for
his
sake
and
not
for
hers
she
seeing
that
he
suffered
longed
to
comfort
him
but
she
was
not
one
of
those
who
live
for
the
moment
and
she
held
her
peace
when
they
reached
the
waiting
procession
everyone
looked
at
sir
godfrey
and
his
pride
was
by
the
challenge
of
their
eyes
again
aroused
for
he
could
do
nothing
nor
feel
nothing
unless
he
was
before
a
mirror
so
he
began
to
be
very
gay
and
though
he
would
have
scorned
to
speak
a
lie
he
acted
one
that
everyone
might
believe
he
had
seen
the
magic
tree
but
the
lady
beatrice
remained
silent
and
sad
when
they
reached
her
gates
he
asked
her
permission
to
enter
then
she
said
some
day
not
now
he
rode
away
without
a
jest
for
she
had
never
before
refused
him
any
courtesy
and
his
heart
was
heavy
within
him
that
night
he
could
not
sleep
but
tossed
upon
his
bed
sometimes
grieving
because
he
had
not
seen
the
magic
tree
and
so
had
been
made
of
no
worth
in
the
lady
beatrice
eyes
sometimes
in
anguish
because
she
had
not
allowed
him
to
enter
her
gates
but
in
all
this
he
loved
himself
so
the
pain
was
but
transitory
and
next
day
he
put
on
his
finest
doublet
of
satin
lined
with
primrose
silk
and
edged
with
pale
corals
and
rode
to
her
gates
there
the
porter
brought
back
word
that
the
lady
beatrice
could
not
see
him
sir
godfrey
was
angry
then
and
he
sought
to
make
her
jealous
next
day
when
at
the
jousts
he
sat
at
the
feet
of
her
cousin
lady
alladine
nor
did
he
look
towards
the
lady
beatrice
but
all
that
only
heaped
fire
on
his
own
heart
and
he
rode
home
to
his
castle
with
his
brow
dark
the
singing
birds
seemed
to
mock
him
and
he
thought
he
heard
the
shrill
laughter
of
the
who
live
in
the
deep
dells
that
night
he
could
not
sleep
but
murmured
again
and
again
that
she
was
his
own
love
and
not
the
lady
alladine
so
full
of
meekness
he
rode
next
day
to
the
castle
of
his
heart
life
but
the
porter
brought
back
to
him
the
same
message
and
sir
godfrey
departed
full
of
anguish
his
pain
like
a
scourge
drove
him
on
and
on
until
he
was
far
off
in
the
desert
amid
the
tangled
and
tripping
briers
and
the
stones
the
rain
beat
upon
his
head
and
upon
his
silken
clothes
but
he
was
unmindful
of
it
because
he
had
begun
to
grieve
not
for
himself
but
for
his
sweet
lost
love
the
days
went
by
and
he
grew
thin
and
worn
with
his
grieving
and
because
he
learned
how
salt
is
the
taste
of
tears
he
began
to
pity
everything
that
suffered
he
was
worn
out
with
his
memories
for
now
he
never
thought
of
his
noble
deeds
but
of
the
times
when
he
had
given
pain
to
others
often
he
remembered
the
poor
and
her
birds
at
first
he
would
say
i
gave
her
gold
then
a
voice
in
his
heart
answered
gold
can
not
pay
for
life
so
one
day
he
went
to
the
and
bought
a
fine
gray
goose
with
a
bill
as
red
as
a
cardinal
robe
and
he
tucked
the
bird
under
his
arm
though
the
people
jeered
to
see
a
noble
knight
carrying
a
goose
but
sir
godfrey
cared
not
he
went
straight
to
the
village
green
where
the
was
leading
her
birds
around
and
bowed
low
before
her
as
if
she
were
a
great
lady
i
am
sorry
that
i
killed
one
of
your
flock
he
said
will
you
take
this
fellow
for
forgiveness
sake
then
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
took
into
her
arms
from
his
the
gray
goose
whose
bill
was
red
as
a
cardinal
robe
and
stroked
his
feathers
why
do
you
cry
asked
sir
godfrey
i
am
glad
you
are
a
true
knight
she
answered
then
sir
godfrey
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
might
bring
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
lady
beatrice
for
he
felt
that
never
more
would
she
believe
him
a
true
knight
the
world
was
full
of
flying
leaves
for
it
was
autumn
then
the
winds
died
and
the
snows
came
bitter
winter
chained
the
mountain
streams
and
laid
the
forests
asleep
the
stars
shone
blue
and
on
the
windowpanes
were
fairy
pictures
now
the
time
drew
near
the
birth
of
christ
and
one
day
sir
godfrey
was
overjoyed
to
receive
a
message
from
the
lady
beatrice
bidding
him
to
a
feast
on
christmas
eve
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
wait
for
the
hour
to
come
and
all
that
day
he
thought
upon
the
joy
of
beholding
her
again
towards
nightfall
the
wind
rose
and
the
snow
began
to
fly
but
to
sir
godfrey
it
was
as
if
the
air
were
full
of
dainty
flowers
nor
did
he
regard
the
cold
nor
the
whistling
tempest
but
rode
in
deep
joy
and
humility
to
the
castlegate
of
the
lady
beatrice
when
he
had
nearly
reached
it
he
heard
a
feeble
voice
crying
stop
sir
knight
for
the
love
of
heaven
stop
and
looking
down
he
saw
a
bent
old
woman
holding
her
hands
out
to
him
in
supplication
every
moment
delay
was
as
the
point
of
a
sharp
sword
against
his
heart
but
he
had
himself
suffered
too
much
to
turn
from
the
voice
of
pain
and
leaning
from
his
saddle
he
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
mother
sir
knight
she
replied
my
home
lies
on
the
farther
side
of
the
dark
wood
and
the
neighbor
who
was
to
convey
me
thither
has
no
doubt
forgotten
his
promise
i
have
a
sick
son
there
for
whose
sake
i
made
this
journey
wilt
thou
for
the
love
of
heaven
take
me
up
behind
thee
and
convey
me
through
the
dark
wood
to
my
dwelling
i
can
not
walk
through
this
tempest
and
my
son
may
die
then
sir
godfrey
was
as
a
man
turned
into
marble
by
enchantment
and
his
heart
was
sore
with
struggle
before
him
were
the
lights
of
the
castle
which
held
his
love
if
he
carried
this
woman
to
her
home
he
could
not
see
his
lady
beatrice
who
perhaps
would
never
forgive
him
for
not
appearing
at
her
summons
the
thought
was
as
death
to
him
and
he
looked
broodingly
down
at
the
poor
woman
i
am
bidden
to
a
feast
mother
he
said
the
porter
of
this
castle
will
give
you
shelter
for
the
night
and
in
the
morning
i
will
convey
you
through
the
dark
wood
to
your
home
the
morning
may
be
too
late
sir
knight
she
said
sadly
then
without
a
word
sir
godfrey
turned
his
horse
and
though
his
heart
was
like
lead
he
bent
a
cheerful
countenance
to
the
stranger
and
assisted
her
to
the
place
behind
the
saddle
and
off
they
rode
together
through
the
night
and
storm
sir
godfrey
spoke
but
little
since
his
thoughts
were
with
the
lady
beatrice
and
the
empty
chair
at
the
feast
which
should
have
been
his
he
saw
her
face
imprinted
on
the
night
dark
veil
and
heard
her
voice
calling
him
on
the
whistling
wind
the
old
woman
behind
him
muttered
of
the
storm
while
on
and
on
they
rode
at
last
they
entered
the
dark
wood
and
here
they
made
slower
progress
for
the
light
of
sir
godfrey
little
lantern
was
feeble
and
the
trees
cast
confusing
shadows
by
and
by
the
old
woman
began
to
moan
that
she
was
cold
that
she
felt
herself
dying
of
the
cold
o
would
that
we
could
reach
the
tree
which
sheds
warmth
and
bears
fruit
even
in
this
bitter
weather
she
cried
o
knight
hasten
forward
to
the
tree
but
sir
godfrey
made
no
answer
for
he
was
now
sure
that
he
should
never
be
holy
enough
to
behold
the
tree
and
he
too
felt
the
sorrow
and
cold
of
death
creep
upon
him
and
a
dreadful
fear
that
never
again
should
he
leave
the
dark
wood
alive
but
would
perish
there
miserably
he
could
no
longer
see
the
path
and
the
arms
of
the
old
woman
clinging
to
him
were
like
the
touch
of
ice
o
mother
he
cried
pray
for
our
deliverance
for
i
have
lost
the
road
at
that
moment
his
lantern
went
out
and
he
gave
a
cry
of
despair
for
he
had
nothing
wherewith
to
relight
it
fear
not
cried
the
old
woman
but
press
on
so
through
the
dark
he
urged
his
horse
seeing
nothing
and
feeling
more
dead
than
alive
for
he
now
knew
that
both
he
and
his
passenger
must
perish
of
the
cold
but
even
as
he
was
resigning
his
heart
to
the
will
of
heaven
he
saw
afar
off
a
beautiful
clear
rosy
light
shedding
long
rays
over
the
snow
and
where
the
light
lay
the
snowflakes
fell
no
more
but
a
delicate
breeze
soft
and
caressing
issued
like
a
breath
of
spring
from
that
circle
the
old
woman
cried
the
tree
the
tree
sir
godfrey
heart
leaped
with
joy
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
at
last
worthy
to
behold
the
tree
yet
there
it
rose
oh
so
glorious
its
trunk
glowing
with
a
sweet
warm
fire
its
branches
covered
with
lights
and
heavy
with
delicious
fruit
he
laughed
with
joy
while
the
old
woman
softly
wept
even
the
horse
saw
the
fine
sight
for
he
whinnied
his
pleasure
then
the
knight
dismounted
and
turned
to
lift
the
old
woman
down
when
suddenly
she
threw
back
her
hood
and
straightened
herself
and
there
smiling
into
his
eyes
was
his
own
love
the
lady
beatrice
o
my
true
knight
she
cried
for
the
sake
of
a
stranger
thou
didst
brave
death
now
with
thy
love
shalt
thou
live
then
sir
godfrey
cried
out
with
joy
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
many
times
while
from
behind
the
tree
came
running
all
the
nobles
and
peasants
who
had
been
able
to
see
its
wonders
and
they
all
circled
sir
godfrey
and
the
lady
beatrice
while
they
plighted
their
troth
then
all
ate
the
fruit
and
made
merry
in
the
rosy
warmth
until
the
christmas
morning
dawned
when
they
went
back
in
the
sunshine
to
celebrate
the
marriage
of
sir
godfrey
and
the
lady
beatrice
who
lived
happily
ever
afterwards
for
how
otherwise
could
it
be
with
lovers
that
had
together
beheld
the
tree
in
the
dark
wood
the
cat
that
winked
once
there
was
an
old
woman
who
lived
on
the
edge
of
the
dark
wood
in
a
small
cottage
all
covered
with
thick
thatch
and
over
the
thatch
grew
a
honeysuckle
vine
but
at
the
gable
where
the
chimneys
clustered
the
wisteria
flung
purple
flowers
in
may
on
the
topmost
chimney
was
a
stork
nest
and
there
dear
grandfather
stork
stood
on
one
leg
unless
he
was
wanted
to
carry
a
little
baby
to
some
house
in
the
village
when
he
flapped
his
wings
and
flew
away
over
the
to
the
land
of
little
souls
now
the
old
woman
loved
her
home
because
she
had
lived
there
many
years
with
her
husband
she
loved
the
two
worn
chairs
on
each
side
of
the
great
hearth
and
her
pewter
dishes
and
her
big
china
with
flowers
shining
on
it
not
for
themselves
but
for
the
reason
that
once
someone
had
used
them
and
admired
them
with
her
into
the
little
latticed
windows
the
roses
peeped
and
these
mother
huldah
loved
too
and
tended
carefully
all
through
the
but
perhaps
she
liked
best
the
long
winter
evenings
when
she
spun
by
the
fire
and
sang
little
songs
like
these
my
heart
as
a
bird
has
flown
away
princess
where
princess
where
into
the
land
that
is
always
gay
out
of
the
land
of
care
but
no
bird
flies
alone
to
bliss
princess
why
princess
why
i
have
no
answer
but
a
kiss
and
then
the
open
sky
nobody
listened
but
tommie
who
was
an
immense
black
cat
held
in
great
reverence
by
the
villagers
for
he
had
the
greenest
eyes
and
the
longest
whiskers
and
the
heaviest
fur
of
any
cat
in
the
kingdom
moreover
he
had
hundreds
of
mice
to
his
credit
and
no
birds
for
he
was
a
good
and
wise
grimalkin
sometimes
he
talked
with
his
tail
and
sometimes
he
opened
his
pink
mouth
and
said
just
as
plain
as
words
that
he
had
been
stalking
through
the
moonlight
and
had
seen
old
egbert
go
limping
home
as
if
he
had
the
rheumatism
so
next
day
mother
huldah
with
her
little
bag
of
medicines
and
ointments
would
go
to
old
egbert
hut
and
sure
enough
find
him
bedridden
or
tommie
would
tell
her
that
charlemagne
the
stork
had
carried
a
baby
to
a
poor
mother
who
had
no
clothes
for
it
then
mother
huldah
would
go
to
her
great
cedar
chest
and
take
out
linen
that
smelled
all
sweetly
of
lavender
and
carry
it
with
some
good
food
to
the
poor
woman
mother
huldah
was
so
kind
and
generous
that
everybody
got
in
the
habit
of
taking
things
from
her
without
sometimes
so
much
as
a
thank
you
or
an
inquiry
as
to
her
own
health
but
the
little
children
loved
her
because
she
made
them
pretty
cakes
and
told
them
the
stories
she
used
to
tell
her
own
children
her
two
fine
sons
who
were
soldiers
these
sons
sent
her
the
money
upon
which
she
lived
and
out
of
which
she
made
her
little
charities
and
they
wrote
her
fine
brave
letters
and
every
year
they
came
home
to
see
her
bearing
beautiful
presents
from
foreign
lands
ivory
toys
and
shining
silks
which
she
always
gave
to
some
bride
and
workboxes
of
wood
richly
carved
to
show
how
much
they
loved
her
one
dreadful
year
a
great
war
broke
out
and
not
long
after
mother
huldah
heard
that
her
two
sons
had
been
killed
and
she
herself
thought
she
would
follow
them
through
grief
but
she
lived
on
and
as
she
grew
more
sorrowful
she
went
less
and
less
to
the
village
and
people
began
to
forget
her
even
the
little
children
stayed
away
since
she
had
no
longer
the
heart
to
tell
them
the
tales
she
had
once
told
her
sons
and
she
must
no
longer
bake
the
little
cakes
since
every
day
saw
her
small
hoard
of
money
diminishing
at
last
when
the
winter
tempests
were
raging
and
the
sleet
was
beating
upon
the
thatch
there
came
a
day
when
no
food
remained
in
the
cottage
and
mother
huldah
felt
too
weak
and
sick
to
go
out
in
quest
of
it
nor
did
she
wish
to
tell
her
neighbors
that
no
food
remained
in
the
cottage
so
full
of
weary
dreams
and
old
sad
thoughts
she
sat
down
in
one
of
the
armchairs
before
the
fire
and
whether
she
nodded
from
drowsiness
or
whether
tommie
nodded
at
her
she
never
knew
but
he
moved
his
black
head
and
opened
his
pink
mouth
and
said
he
suppose
i
fetch
you
a
bird
just
this
once
she
was
much
surprised
for
tommie
had
never
talked
to
her
before
but
she
did
not
show
how
astonished
she
was
because
she
was
always
very
polite
to
him
so
she
replied
bless
your
whiskers
tommie
but
we
break
through
our
rule
maybe
some
neighbor
will
fetch
me
a
loaf
maybe
they
will
and
perhaps
they
wo
said
tommie
they
an
ungrateful
lot
they
think
i
am
still
rich
my
dear
she
answered
so
you
are
but
not
in
the
way
they
mean
tommie
said
and
mother
huldah
if
they
neglect
you
a
day
longer
it
wo
be
your
tommie
fault
then
mother
huldah
shook
her
finger
at
him
you
switch
your
tail
just
as
if
you
were
going
to
steal
something
tommie
i
brought
you
up
better
than
that
steal
nonsense
cried
tommie
most
of
have
more
than
they
need
anyway
tommie
i
believe
you
hungry
or
your
morals
would
be
so
queer
mother
huldah
said
reprovingly
hungry
exclaimed
tommie
i
dream
of
lobster
claws
and
chicken
wings
and
blue
saucers
full
of
yellow
wrinkled
cream
twelve
in
a
row
no
wonder
my
morals
are
queer
then
what
happened
was
that
poor
mother
huldah
dozed
off
to
sleep
and
when
she
awoke
there
was
tommie
staring
into
the
fire
his
green
eyes
like
two
lanterns
and
his
whiskers
standing
out
very
stiff
and
knowing
and
at
mother
huldah
feet
was
a
wicker
basket
from
which
issued
a
most
appetizing
odor
why
thomas
she
always
called
him
thomas
in
solemn
moments
what
this
your
dinner
said
tommie
and
yawned
like
a
gentleman
who
lights
a
cigarette
and
says
o
hang
it
all
what
a
beastly
bore
life
is
thomas
questioned
mother
huldah
solemnly
where
did
you
get
this
dinner
for
she
had
taken
the
cover
off
the
basket
and
found
a
small
roast
chicken
with
vegetables
and
a
bread
pudding
why
i
was
strolling
down
the
gray
lane
when
i
met
a
woman
carrying
that
basket
and
i
smelled
chicken
so
up
i
stood
on
my
hind
legs
and
winked
at
her
and
i
said
you
i
know
you
are
taking
that
to
mother
huldah
let
me
carry
it
the
rest
of
the
way
but
mother
huldah
cried
maybe
the
dinner
was
for
me
and
you
frightened
her
so
she
had
to
give
it
to
you
tommie
yawned
again
do
you
think
that
the
best
thing
you
can
do
with
a
good
dinner
is
to
eat
it
so
mother
huldah
ate
her
dinner
hoping
all
the
while
that
she
was
making
an
honest
meal
then
when
she
had
fed
thomas
she
asked
him
if
charlemagne
was
on
the
roof
indeed
no
cried
he
charlemagne
has
flown
to
the
war
country
to
fetch
you
a
baby
alas
cried
mother
huldah
i
pity
the
poor
babes
but
how
can
i
bring
up
a
baby
it
is
your
granddaughter
said
tommie
charlemagne
told
me
that
a
year
ago
your
son
rupert
married
but
he
meant
to
bring
his
bride
home
as
a
surprise
to
you
then
the
war
broke
out
and
o
poor
little
cried
mother
huldah
did
she
break
her
heart
yes
and
so
she
followed
rupert
to
the
country
of
the
brave
souls
but
charlemagne
is
fetching
the
baby
in
a
warm
woolen
napkin
tied
up
at
the
four
corners
and
when
his
wings
get
tired
from
flying
he
puts
a
bit
of
sugar
and
a
drop
of
water
in
the
baby
mouth
and
leans
his
feathery
breast
against
its
little
feet
to
keep
them
warm
yes
yes
said
mother
huldah
a
baby
feet
should
be
always
kept
warm
but
dear
me
dear
me
the
sweet
one
will
need
milk
before
long
and
the
grain
of
the
whole
wheat
to
help
her
grow
i
have
no
money
to
buy
her
food
tommie
looked
very
wise
mother
huldah
he
said
as
he
drew
a
black
paw
knowingly
over
one
ear
do
you
know
that
wherever
a
baby
comes
help
comes
open
the
linen
chest
and
get
your
shining
shears
and
begin
to
make
little
shirts
and
dresses
i
think
i
take
a
look
at
the
weather
he
made
the
last
remark
carelessly
like
a
young
gentleman
who
will
stroll
out
and
leave
the
to
their
devices
o
tommie
said
mother
huldah
you
are
not
going
to
do
anything
impulsive
mother
huldah
replied
tommie
did
you
ever
know
a
cat
to
do
anything
impulsive
unless
he
saw
a
bird
or
a
mouse
with
that
he
left
her
and
she
watched
him
walk
away
down
the
forest
path
with
the
sunlight
glistening
on
his
coat
and
his
tail
held
high
and
straight
sometimes
he
would
pause
and
lift
one
foot
daintily
the
toes
curling
in
mother
huldah
always
said
that
tommie
heard
not
with
his
ears
but
with
his
whiskers
and
perhaps
it
was
true
tommie
himself
was
making
his
own
plans
as
he
went
along
if
i
tell
these
villagers
outright
that
mother
huldah
is
in
need
each
person
will
think
well
neighbor
jude
or
gossip
dorcas
has
more
to
spare
than
i
someone
else
will
take
care
of
the
poor
old
lady
i
am
sure
and
it
will
end
in
her
getting
nothing
at
all
i
will
not
talk
about
her
but
to
each
person
i
will
talk
about
himself
for
that
is
the
way
to
get
people
interested
at
which
tommie
smiled
and
because
his
was
a
cheshire
cat
his
smile
gave
him
a
wise
and
jovial
look
as
if
the
sphinx
of
egypt
should
suddenly
see
a
joke
with
a
good
heart
he
went
daintily
on
his
way
shaking
the
snow
from
his
paws
at
times
until
he
reached
the
village
green
now
in
the
middle
of
the
green
stood
the
pump
made
of
wood
with
a
flat
top
on
this
tommie
seated
himself
put
his
paws
neatly
together
folded
his
tail
about
them
made
his
green
eyes
perfectly
round
and
stared
straight
ahead
of
him
now
even
a
cat
when
he
looks
as
if
he
could
think
for
himself
will
draw
people
attention
especially
if
he
seems
to
enjoy
his
thoughts
and
tommie
seated
on
the
pump
in
the
bright
winter
sunshine
looked
as
if
he
had
something
in
his
mind
that
pleased
him
said
one
of
the
here
a
you
are
mistaken
replied
tommie
with
a
wink
i
belong
to
mother
huldah
and
she
is
the
best
woman
in
the
village
the
man
was
so
astonished
that
he
dropped
a
parcel
of
eggs
he
was
carrying
and
they
were
all
broken
that
what
comes
said
tommie
of
imagining
evil
where
none
exists
the
man
was
so
angry
that
he
made
some
snowballs
hastily
and
began
to
pelt
tommie
with
them
but
tommie
understood
the
beautiful
art
of
dodging
which
some
people
never
learn
all
their
lives
so
he
did
get
hit
by
this
time
a
crowd
had
gathered
about
the
angry
man
and
were
asking
him
what
was
the
matter
matter
he
shrieked
that
black
object
on
the
pump
gave
me
impudence
cried
little
elsa
how
could
a
cat
give
thee
impudence
ask
him
then
said
the
man
he
can
talk
like
any
christian
at
which
the
crowd
all
looked
at
tommie
who
winked
at
them
and
said
does
anybody
here
want
to
ask
me
any
questions
i
tell
him
what
he
wants
to
know
in
perfect
confidence
between
him
and
me
and
the
pump
if
my
answer
pleases
him
he
can
give
me
a
silver
piece
if
my
reply
make
his
heart
go
with
joy
he
can
give
me
a
gold
piece
if
he
does
like
my
answers
he
need
give
me
anything
now
that
fair
is
it
then
everybody
looked
at
everybody
else
and
dropped
their
jaws
and
rubbed
their
eyes
nobody
stirred
for
a
minute
then
a
fine
young
fellow
stepped
forward
blushing
this
was
carl
the
miller
son
who
was
straight
as
a
and
had
blue
eyes
like
deep
lakes
and
he
walked
right
up
to
the
pump
and
bowed
then
he
whispered
into
ear
does
lucia
love
me
tommie
winked
his
right
eye
and
smiled
carl
he
replied
get
up
your
courage
and
ask
her
for
she
loves
you
better
than
anyone
in
the
world
then
carl
felt
his
heart
go
and
all
the
snow
wreaths
on
the
trees
seemed
to
turn
to
bridal
flowers
thanks
dear
and
wise
pussy
he
said
and
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
spread
it
at
tommie
feet
and
on
it
he
placed
not
one
but
three
gold
pieces
when
the
villagers
saw
the
gold
pieces
glittering
in
the
sun
and
beheld
the
radiant
face
of
carl
they
all
began
to
wonder
and
each
person
wanted
to
try
his
own
luck
after
all
said
each
one
to
himself
if
i
do
like
what
the
cat
says
i
need
pay
him
anything
the
next
person
to
go
up
was
the
village
tanner
whose
skin
was
like
leather
and
whose
eyes
were
little
like
a
pig
tommie
was
already
acquainted
with
him
having
been
kicked
out
of
his
tannery
once
when
on
an
innocent
mousing
expedition
say
said
the
tanner
will
my
uncle
jean
leave
me
his
farm
no
answered
tommie
winking
his
left
eye
that
he
wo
he
knows
you
are
always
wishing
he
would
die
the
tanner
was
so
angry
that
he
snarled
do
you
ever
let
me
catch
you
around
the
tannery
again
or
i
make
you
into
a
muff
for
my
daughter
black
furs
are
not
fashionable
this
winter
said
tommie
next
everybody
laughed
when
they
saw
that
the
tanner
had
paid
money
for
his
information
and
so
presumably
did
like
it
but
strangely
enough
instead
of
discouraging
this
led
them
on
to
try
their
luck
and
the
next
person
who
came
to
ask
tommie
a
question
was
poor
old
henley
the
miser
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
the
cat
ear
so
the
people
behind
him
would
catch
what
he
said
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
he
asked
say
old
whiskers
will
my
fine
ship
loaded
with
dates
and
spices
reach
norway
safely
yes
it
will
said
tommie
long
before
your
withered
old
soul
will
reach
a
haven
of
peace
henley
was
so
excited
over
the
first
words
that
he
did
even
hear
the
last
ones
he
hopped
about
on
one
leg
and
was
rushing
off
at
last
when
tommie
cried
you
have
paid
me
the
miser
felt
in
his
pockets
and
drew
out
a
silver
coin
and
laid
it
on
the
handkerchief
not
at
all
said
tommie
remember
the
worth
of
that
cargo
gold
or
nothing
henley
began
to
whine
i
a
poor
old
man
tommie
i
leave
the
cream
jug
on
the
doorstep
every
day
and
no
questions
will
be
asked
i
not
a
thief
answered
tommie
mother
huldah
brought
me
up
better
than
that
come
you
do
want
to
have
any
quarrel
with
a
black
cat
whereupon
henley
reluctantly
drew
from
his
pocket
a
gold
piece
while
all
the
villagers
opened
their
eyes
very
wide
and
wondered
what
tommie
could
have
told
the
old
gentleman
to
make
him
so
liberal
the
next
person
to
come
up
was
a
little
shy
girl
named
clara
she
had
big
brown
eyes
and
fair
floating
hair
and
under
her
white
chin
and
about
her
little
white
wrists
were
soft
furs
for
her
father
was
a
wealthy
moneylender
she
came
close
to
tommie
and
whispered
tell
me
beautiful
pussy
if
i
shall
ever
win
the
love
of
joseph
grange
tommie
winked
his
right
eye
several
times
and
replied
my
dear
i
see
it
coming
she
flushed
with
joy
and
what
shall
i
do
to
hasten
it
tommie
reflected
a
moment
be
pleasant
but
not
anxious
a
lady
with
an
anxious
expression
has
little
chance
of
winning
a
lover
invite
him
too
often
do
talk
too
much
now
i
have
hurt
your
feelings
have
i
no
indeed
she
said
for
she
was
a
young
lady
of
good
sense
and
tommie
dear
will
you
take
these
gold
pieces
to
mother
huldah
she
was
so
good
to
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
because
i
have
been
so
absorbed
in
my
own
affairs
i
have
been
to
see
her
lately
that
the
trouble
with
being
in
love
said
tommie
it
apt
to
make
people
selfish
and
it
should
make
them
love
and
remember
everybody
it
does
when
it
the
real
thing
little
clara
clasped
her
hands
earnestly
i
will
come
to
see
mother
huldah
this
afternoon
she
said
and
bring
her
some
cakes
of
my
own
baking
after
clara
one
person
and
another
came
up
some
asked
foolish
questions
some
wise
some
paid
down
money
others
did
but
the
pile
of
gold
and
silver
at
tommie
feet
grew
steadily
now
all
novelties
even
talking
cats
soon
cease
to
be
novelties
and
towards
afternoon
when
the
villagers
saw
how
much
of
their
money
lay
at
tommie
feet
some
of
them
began
to
be
discontented
of
these
the
tanner
was
the
ringleader
and
he
said
to
the
other
grumblers
if
we
can
get
that
lying
cat
off
the
pump
we
can
then
take
his
money
i
have
three
big
rats
in
the
trap
at
the
tannery
and
i
know
tommie
is
starving
hungry
by
this
time
we
let
loose
on
the
ground
in
front
of
the
pump
when
he
makes
a
spring
one
of
you
grab
the
money
and
run
now
the
tanner
had
guessed
right
tommie
was
hungry
but
he
was
determined
to
keep
his
post
until
sundown
after
a
while
no
more
people
came
and
he
was
just
thinking
he
would
take
up
the
handkerchief
by
the
four
corners
and
go
home
when
he
espied
a
group
of
people
approaching
suddenly
oh
me
oh
my
three
dinners
were
scampering
towards
him
such
rats
such
big
splendid
rats
in
fine
condition
tommie
had
never
used
such
in
all
his
nine
lives
but
he
sat
tight
and
though
his
whiskers
showed
his
agitation
he
never
budged
the
tanner
was
mad
clear
through
and
he
cried
out
he
a
wizard
he
ought
to
be
killed
because
some
people
ca
see
others
controlling
themselves
without
thinking
there
something
wrong
with
them
then
he
began
to
make
snowballs
and
to
pelt
poor
tommie
now
tommie
as
has
been
said
was
a
good
dodger
but
nevertheless
when
it
rains
snowballs
hard
not
to
get
hit
it
might
have
fared
badly
with
him
had
not
some
knights
and
ladies
at
that
moment
appeared
on
the
scene
in
the
train
of
the
beautiful
princess
yolande
one
of
the
fairest
princesses
in
all
the
realm
she
rode
a
great
white
horse
and
she
was
robed
in
cream
velvet
and
white
furs
while
about
her
slender
waist
was
a
girdle
of
gold
set
with
sapphires
which
were
as
blue
as
her
eyes
by
her
side
rode
lord
mountfalcon
he
was
all
in
black
armor
for
he
was
mourning
a
brother
who
had
died
in
the
distant
war
love
as
well
as
grief
filled
his
heart
for
his
dark
eyes
were
continually
upon
the
beautiful
princess
who
now
reined
in
her
horse
and
cried
out
in
a
sweet
voice
shame
upon
you
men
to
hurt
a
poor
cat
he
is
a
wizard
and
he
belongs
to
a
witch
called
out
the
tanner
o
what
a
wicked
lie
said
tommie
i
do
care
what
names
you
call
me
but
my
mistress
is
one
of
the
best
women
in
the
land
she
has
come
to
poverty
in
her
old
age
for
her
sake
and
to
get
her
a
little
money
sat
here
all
day
answering
truthfully
all
questions
now
dear
princess
yolande
believe
me
for
i
am
a
true
cat
the
princess
was
so
astonished
that
she
could
speak
for
a
moment
at
last
she
turned
to
lord
mountfalcon
and
said
truly
we
have
come
to
wonderland
i
rather
believe
the
cat
than
the
people
who
were
pelting
him
and
i
have
a
mind
to
test
his
powers
let
us
alight
and
ask
him
questions
then
they
all
dismounted
and
with
the
pages
and
the
ladies
and
the
gentlemen
in
armor
the
scene
was
as
gay
as
the
stage
of
an
opera
everybody
chatted
and
laughed
and
some
of
the
court
ladies
stroked
tommie
fur
with
their
pretty
white
hands
and
one
took
off
her
bracelet
and
hung
it
about
his
neck
but
when
the
princess
yolande
went
forward
to
ask
her
question
everyone
fell
back
then
with
sweet
dignity
as
became
a
princess
she
stood
before
tommie
and
said
tell
me
if
lord
mountfalcon
love
me
truly
tommie
did
wink
for
he
knew
the
ways
of
court
his
grandfather
having
been
chief
mouser
to
old
king
adelbert
but
he
purred
a
warm
good
purr
like
a
mill
grinding
out
pure
white
grain
if
the
sky
in
heaven
be
blue
then
mountfalcon
loves
you
true
if
the
sun
set
in
the
west
lord
mountfalcon
loves
you
best
you
see
he
added
i
not
much
of
a
poet
but
those
are
the
facts
never
was
bad
verse
so
sweet
to
me
cried
the
princess
and
she
put
down
a
whole
bag
of
gold
at
tommie
feet
after
her
came
lord
mountfalcon
himself
with
that
sad
grace
of
his
and
all
his
spirit
shadowed
with
love
and
grief
sir
puss
he
said
shall
i
wed
ever
the
princess
yolande
before
there
are
violets
in
the
vales
of
the
kingdom
replied
tommie
two
saddlebags
will
not
hold
the
gold
i
shall
give
thee
exclaimed
the
nobleman
bring
them
to
the
cottage
where
mother
huldah
lives
said
tommie
and
i
ask
this
further
favor
when
you
leave
this
spot
will
you
take
me
up
behind
you
and
give
this
money
to
a
page
to
convey
and
so
bring
me
safely
home
with
the
wealth
for
i
fear
mischief
from
the
tanner
most
willingly
said
mountfalcon
i
will
present
your
request
to
the
princess
after
him
all
the
court
came
with
questions
so
when
the
page
advanced
to
gather
up
the
money
the
load
was
almost
more
than
he
could
carry
then
tommie
jumped
down
from
his
perch
and
another
page
lifted
him
safely
on
to
the
big
warm
back
of
lord
mountfalcon
horse
which
felt
fine
and
comforting
to
poor
tommie
feet
he
was
so
tired
that
he
took
forty
winks
after
he
had
told
the
princess
how
to
reach
the
cottage
of
mother
huldah
when
he
woke
they
were
all
in
the
dim
forest
and
the
princess
yolande
and
lord
mountfalcon
were
talking
in
low
tones
like
the
whisper
of
the
wind
through
flowers
and
it
seemed
as
if
their
talk
were
all
of
love
and
dreams
and
griefs
and
tears
that
must
fall
at
last
they
reined
in
their
horses
where
mother
huldah
stood
at
her
gate
peering
into
the
forest
when
she
saw
the
beautiful
lady
and
the
noble
knight
and
tommie
on
the
horse
back
she
cried
out
o
bless
you
sir
knight
for
bringing
him
home
and
i
brought
a
fortune
with
me
mother
huldah
cried
tommie
at
this
mother
huldah
looked
troubled
gracious
lady
she
addressed
the
princess
i
hope
my
cat
has
not
been
up
to
mischief
no
bless
him
replied
the
princess
then
she
told
all
that
tommie
had
done
and
fear
not
to
take
the
money
mother
she
added
for
those
who
gave
it
did
so
of
their
alas
i
would
not
take
it
sighed
mother
huldah
had
not
my
rupert
and
my
hugh
died
in
the
great
war
and
rupert
wife
went
with
him
to
the
kingdom
of
the
brave
souls
and
i
expect
charlemagne
with
their
little
baby
rupert
what
rupert
asked
lord
mountfalcon
leaning
down
from
his
horse
rupert
gordon
i
am
huldah
gordon
his
bereaved
mother
then
mountfalcon
removed
his
cap
alighted
from
his
horse
and
bowed
low
before
mother
huldah
he
died
gloriously
he
died
trying
to
remove
my
poor
brother
from
danger
he
said
now
let
me
be
as
a
son
to
you
for
sweet
memory
sake
illustration
charlemagne
brings
the
baby
to
mother
huldah
then
they
all
wept
softly
for
even
to
hear
of
those
battles
and
those
silent
ones
in
the
kingdom
of
the
brave
souls
was
to
behold
the
world
through
tears
and
the
princess
yolande
alighted
and
kissed
mother
huldah
hands
and
promised
to
visit
her
often
so
with
many
true
words
they
parted
at
last
and
mother
huldah
was
left
alone
with
tommie
and
the
bags
of
gold
and
silver
which
she
took
indoors
and
then
returned
to
scan
the
sky
where
now
the
white
stars
hung
and
a
thin
of
a
moon
tommie
romped
in
the
snow
for
the
joy
of
stretching
his
legs
after
a
while
he
said
listen
do
you
hear
something
mother
huldah
i
would
i
heard
wings
she
cried
but
i
hear
wings
said
tommie
watch
watch
where
the
north
star
burns
so
mother
huldah
watched
and
soon
she
saw
the
great
outspread
wings
of
charlemagne
and
saw
his
long
bill
with
something
hanging
from
the
end
of
it
my
word
here
the
baby
called
out
tommie
hello
charlemagne
you
old
grandpa
have
you
kept
that
precious
infant
warm
but
charlemagne
alighted
on
his
feet
and
walked
solemnly
to
mother
huldah
and
laid
in
her
arms
the
softest
sweetest
pinkest
little
baby
that
she
had
ever
seen
there
was
golden
down
on
its
head
and
its
little
hands
were
folded
like
rosebuds
beneath
its
tiny
chin
mother
huldah
felt
its
feet
to
know
if
they
were
warm
then
she
cried
and
sobbed
and
held
the
little
thing
to
her
breast
and
trembled
for
love
of
it
take
it
before
the
fire
said
tommie
we
all
tired
and
it
will
be
good
to
drowse
and
dream
charlemagne
the
chimney
warm
so
the
stork
flew
up
to
the
roof
and
mother
huldah
took
her
treasure
and
held
it
in
her
warm
ample
lap
before
the
fire
and
tommie
winked
and
dozed
and
looked
at
the
baby
with
his
great
green
eyes
while
mother
huldah
sang
the
gold
of
the
world
will
fade
away
baby
sleep
baby
sleep
but
thou
wilt
live
in
my
heart
alway
sleep
my
darling
sleep
the
gold
of
the
world
it
comes
and
goes
baby
sleep
baby
sleep
but
thou
wilt
bloom
like
a
summer
rose
cease
my
soul
to
weep
the
magic
tears
there
was
once
a
king
named
theophile
who
lived
in
a
dim
castle
on
the
edge
of
the
ocean
but
so
far
above
the
water
that
the
flying
spray
never
reached
its
lowest
terrace
and
only
the
seagulls
could
circle
its
towers
and
turrets
it
was
a
strange
melancholy
beautiful
place
where
the
light
shimmered
on
the
walls
like
the
ripple
of
water
and
in
the
shadows
of
the
massive
walls
the
flowers
waved
all
day
in
the
like
little
princesses
who
would
dance
before
they
died
king
theophile
had
led
many
armies
to
victory
driving
his
golden
boats
upon
coasts
but
from
each
conquest
he
returned
the
sadder
because
he
had
made
many
people
hate
him
and
had
won
no
one
love
nor
could
he
find
a
woman
who
would
wed
him
because
of
the
sorrows
of
his
line
which
were
great
when
he
was
not
at
war
he
would
labor
for
his
kingdom
until
sunset
and
at
that
hour
he
would
leave
his
council
chamber
to
pace
the
terraces
and
gaze
seaward
over
the
rocking
waves
while
his
minstrels
sang
to
him
only
music
could
drive
away
his
care
so
always
a
page
with
a
golden
harp
followed
him
sometimes
he
would
bid
everyone
be
gone
but
this
boy
and
the
two
would
glide
like
shadows
through
the
long
galleries
where
the
bluish
tapestries
hung
or
brood
together
by
the
roaring
fire
when
the
sleet
rattled
on
the
casements
one
spring
day
when
it
seemed
as
if
even
the
ocean
air
wafted
the
fragrance
of
little
pale
flowers
and
the
sun
shone
warmly
on
the
old
gray
walls
of
the
castle
the
king
and
the
boy
wandered
into
the
garden
of
the
white
lilacs
where
on
a
marble
bench
king
theophile
seated
himself
and
listened
while
the
boy
sang
my
love
came
out
of
an
old
dream
and
took
away
my
peace
and
now
i
dare
not
sleep
again
until
this
heartache
cease
did
he
ever
know
slumber
again
i
wonder
said
the
king
o
boy
of
what
use
are
your
to
arouse
love
in
your
heart
sire
what
good
is
that
when
i
have
no
maiden
to
love
listen
sire
said
the
boy
you
are
going
to
war
with
king
mace
who
has
a
most
beautiful
daughter
the
princess
elene
when
you
have
overthrown
him
bring
her
to
your
kingdom
and
wed
her
a
strange
way
to
win
the
love
of
a
woman
said
the
king
by
invading
her
father
kingdom
nevertheless
i
will
have
regard
to
the
maiden
i
have
heard
said
the
page
that
they
who
once
behold
her
are
restless
ever
afterwards
from
the
wound
of
her
beauty
the
king
nodded
wearily
there
are
women
like
that
gleams
from
lost
stars
faces
seen
at
sunset
or
where
the
light
is
lifting
after
a
storm
i
have
never
cast
eyes
on
such
a
maid
when
you
see
the
princess
elene
you
will
behold
her
said
the
page
i
will
set
forth
to
war
immediately
announced
the
king
soon
thereafter
he
sailed
away
and
over
the
rocking
billows
went
the
golden
boats
until
they
drove
upon
the
coasts
of
king
mace
land
where
bitter
battles
were
fought
and
many
men
laid
asleep
with
the
sword
then
came
a
day
when
all
was
quiet
and
even
king
mace
pillowed
his
royal
head
on
his
dead
horse
and
woke
no
more
then
king
theophile
entered
the
little
sunny
palace
where
all
was
so
silent
and
strode
through
the
echoing
corridors
to
the
throne
room
there
alone
beneath
a
canopy
of
azure
satin
on
the
great
throne
sat
a
woman
whose
face
was
like
a
gleam
from
a
lost
star
she
had
proud
lips
and
hair
that
was
like
cloth
of
gold
about
her
and
eyes
that
were
wells
of
sorrow
when
he
beheld
her
king
theophile
limbs
became
as
weak
as
a
child
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
wind
that
had
traveled
from
the
kingdom
of
lost
hope
he
knew
that
henceforth
for
him
there
must
be
either
love
or
death
o
princess
he
cried
they
are
all
asleep
but
thou
and
i
are
awake
nay
she
replied
they
are
awake
their
spirits
crowd
this
hall
to
wring
my
heart
with
pity
but
thou
art
asleep
her
words
were
like
a
sword
in
his
breast
and
kneeling
before
her
he
cried
come
with
me
to
my
kingdom
thou
art
my
only
love
thou
mayst
force
me
to
wed
thee
she
replied
but
the
sword
which
can
slay
can
never
wake
love
to
life
thou
hast
come
to
the
end
of
thy
conquests
then
king
theophile
tasted
the
bitterness
of
death
as
the
men
who
slept
from
the
stroke
of
his
sword
could
never
taste
it
and
because
he
was
not
a
man
to
put
his
soul
into
the
keeping
of
his
tongue
he
made
no
answer
but
in
his
secret
heart
he
resolved
to
win
her
love
though
the
adventure
cost
him
years
of
pain
so
while
he
lingered
in
her
kingdom
building
costly
monuments
to
the
dead
and
showering
gold
on
the
wounded
and
sending
into
fine
houses
the
homeless
whose
hearts
ached
for
vanished
humble
hearths
while
he
worked
to
draw
life
out
of
death
he
spared
no
effort
to
bring
a
smile
to
the
lips
of
the
princess
elene
but
she
never
smiled
and
though
her
heart
was
breaking
she
could
not
weep
often
she
said
to
her
women
pray
that
i
may
have
the
gift
of
tears
but
always
her
eyes
remained
dry
like
the
vision
of
those
who
have
gazed
too
long
on
fire
to
king
theophile
she
seemed
the
very
beauty
of
the
world
as
in
her
black
robes
she
sat
in
her
garden
at
her
tapestry
frame
or
listened
with
veiled
eyes
to
the
singing
of
his
minstrels
and
in
his
heart
was
a
battle
greater
than
any
he
had
ever
waged
in
desolated
lands
for
his
nobler
self
told
him
he
had
no
right
to
wed
her
but
his
wild
love
drove
like
a
tempest
across
these
whispers
illustration
king
theophile
and
queen
elene
so
at
last
he
married
her
in
the
dim
cathedral
church
of
her
dead
father
kingdom
with
pomp
of
flowers
and
lights
and
nuptial
music
and
she
was
as
pale
as
those
who
live
long
underground
then
the
golden
boats
drove
home
across
the
rocking
billows
and
one
day
the
queen
elene
as
she
was
now
titled
lifted
her
eyes
and
beheld
the
gaunt
castle
of
king
theophile
cutting
the
sky
a
mist
seemed
to
hang
all
its
turrets
with
fog
and
vapor
elene
remembered
the
shining
happy
little
castle
of
her
vanished
kingdom
and
her
heart
was
bitter
with
tears
but
she
could
not
shed
them
king
theophile
gazing
upon
her
face
read
her
thoughts
for
he
had
the
of
lovers
and
his
heart
was
as
lead
in
his
breast
he
was
jealous
of
the
very
years
when
he
had
not
known
her
her
beauty
troubled
him
like
a
half
remembered
name
and
when
he
was
in
her
presence
he
had
the
trembling
of
illness
upon
him
and
when
away
from
her
he
was
as
restless
as
a
fallen
leaf
that
the
wind
blows
through
many
days
and
weeks
he
wooed
her
to
bring
the
smile
to
her
lips
but
always
she
grew
whiter
and
more
desolate
so
that
when
she
walked
the
terraces
above
the
boiling
surf
she
seemed
like
a
white
flower
torn
of
its
petals
and
tossed
up
by
the
bitter
waves
at
the
end
of
a
year
there
came
a
daughter
from
the
kingdom
of
the
little
souls
and
lay
like
a
white
bud
on
the
queen
bosom
then
at
last
elene
smiled
and
wept
but
her
strength
was
gone
and
soon
afterwards
she
closed
her
eyes
and
went
to
sleep
king
theophile
heart
was
broken
for
the
baby
and
not
he
himself
had
made
elene
smile
and
weep
when
the
days
of
the
court
mourning
were
over
the
little
daughter
was
christened
and
to
her
christening
came
all
the
wise
women
of
the
kingdom
each
told
what
this
child
would
be
one
said
she
will
have
the
beauty
of
shimmering
rainbows
another
she
will
be
as
wise
as
she
is
good
but
the
wisest
woman
of
all
said
every
person
will
read
his
future
in
her
tears
now
this
prophecy
troubled
king
theophile
and
awoke
love
in
his
heart
for
his
little
daughter
who
was
already
showing
how
beautiful
she
would
be
some
day
so
he
watched
over
her
and
made
one
of
his
echoing
rooms
into
the
royal
nursery
now
the
nurses
knew
what
the
wisest
woman
had
said
that
the
tears
of
this
princess
would
be
a
magic
mirror
of
the
future
and
one
day
when
the
child
was
two
years
old
the
head
nurse
who
had
a
sweetheart
and
wished
to
know
whether
she
would
marry
him
resolved
to
make
the
little
girl
cry
now
she
was
puzzled
how
to
do
this
for
the
royal
maid
was
and
obedient
but
the
nurse
knew
that
elene
loved
most
dearly
a
beautiful
doll
as
big
as
herself
so
one
afternoon
when
the
princess
was
clasping
this
treasure
to
her
little
breast
the
nurse
making
sure
first
that
no
one
was
looking
snatched
it
from
her
and
threw
it
into
the
sea
illustration
the
nurse
sees
her
wedding
in
the
princess
tears
the
when
she
saw
her
darling
doll
falling
into
the
water
began
to
wail
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
then
her
nurse
knelt
before
her
and
saw
in
those
tears
her
own
wedding
so
happy
was
she
over
this
sight
that
she
jumped
up
and
began
to
caper
about
heeding
not
the
sobs
of
the
poor
little
princess
but
king
theophile
heard
them
and
came
out
with
a
face
of
thunder
woman
he
cried
why
do
you
dance
when
a
princess
weeps
then
the
nurse
came
to
her
senses
and
grew
gray
with
fear
she
tried
to
mutter
some
excuse
but
king
theophile
dismissed
her
on
the
spot
and
gathering
up
his
baby
into
his
arms
took
her
into
the
nursery
and
wiped
away
her
tears
yet
her
sobs
did
not
cease
and
she
was
too
little
to
tell
him
of
her
woe
the
nurse
though
she
left
the
king
service
did
marry
immediately
and
began
to
whisper
how
she
had
seen
her
wedding
in
the
tears
of
the
princess
elene
which
word
was
to
work
out
cruelly
for
the
royal
child
from
that
day
on
those
about
her
though
they
loved
her
dearly
could
not
refrain
from
trying
their
fortune
in
her
tears
as
she
grew
older
and
more
understanding
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
know
how
to
make
her
cry
without
incurring
suspicion
but
even
a
wrong
will
finds
its
way
and
little
elene
grew
up
wondering
why
people
were
so
unkind
to
her
and
why
there
was
so
much
sadness
in
the
world
for
when
all
else
failed
the
minstrels
could
make
her
weep
by
singing
of
old
unhappy
things
and
battles
king
theophile
did
not
know
of
these
troubles
of
his
little
daughter
for
she
had
learned
early
that
her
tears
hurt
him
so
she
concealed
them
from
him
all
his
joy
was
now
in
her
for
she
was
the
very
image
of
her
dead
mother
and
beautiful
as
a
dawn
of
may
day
when
she
danced
she
was
like
the
light
that
ripples
over
the
flowers
when
she
sang
the
souls
of
all
young
birds
seemed
to
float
on
her
voice
the
fame
of
her
beauty
went
through
many
kingdoms
and
with
the
legend
of
her
loveliness
was
told
the
strange
tale
of
her
magic
tears
now
three
young
princes
from
three
great
states
fell
ardently
in
love
with
elene
from
the
mere
breath
of
the
rumor
of
her
charms
the
first
was
prince
tristan
the
second
prince
martin
the
third
prince
lorenzo
and
both
prince
tristan
and
prince
martin
were
sure
of
winning
but
prince
lorenzo
was
not
at
all
sure
because
he
had
lost
much
in
his
short
life
and
knew
that
love
is
like
the
wind
that
comes
and
goes
like
the
fire
that
leaps
into
the
night
and
is
seen
no
more
like
the
star
that
flashes
across
the
dark
zenith
and
then
vanishes
one
may
morning
the
three
princes
arrived
to
try
their
fortunes
and
to
sue
for
the
hand
of
the
princess
elene
prince
tristan
who
was
straight
and
handsome
put
on
his
best
white
satin
doublet
and
stuck
a
rose
behind
his
ear
prince
martin
put
on
glittering
armor
like
a
knight
going
to
battle
but
prince
lorenzo
was
so
consumed
with
love
that
he
thought
not
at
all
of
what
he
wore
king
theophile
himself
led
them
into
the
presence
of
the
princess
elene
who
was
clad
in
a
silk
robe
that
shimmered
like
a
rainbow
and
who
looked
so
beautiful
that
for
an
instant
prince
lorenzo
put
his
hand
before
his
eyes
the
two
other
princes
gazed
straight
at
the
lady
then
made
grand
sweeping
bows
may
i
tell
you
said
prince
tristan
holding
out
his
rose
that
you
are
the
most
beautiful
princess
i
have
ever
seen
may
i
tell
you
said
prince
martin
that
your
eyes
are
like
stars
prince
lorenzo
remained
mute
because
his
heart
was
too
full
for
speech
and
king
theophile
looked
coldly
upon
him
but
the
princess
elene
gazed
at
him
until
he
blushed
then
she
seated
herself
on
her
throne
and
bade
the
princes
speak
to
her
of
what
pleased
them
best
prince
tristan
began
at
once
to
tell
her
of
his
hunting
exploits
and
what
joy
he
took
in
the
chase
but
the
princess
face
grew
colder
and
colder
as
she
listened
for
she
loved
all
living
things
and
could
not
bear
to
see
any
of
them
hurt
tristan
did
not
observe
this
for
like
all
vain
people
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
charms
and
so
was
unaware
of
the
effect
he
was
producing
he
finished
with
a
flourish
and
prince
martin
stumbled
in
on
the
last
words
so
eager
was
he
to
render
in
his
turn
a
glowing
account
of
all
his
fine
deeds
these
were
not
few
for
he
was
a
brave
lad
so
for
an
hour
he
discoursed
upon
tourneys
and
battles
nor
did
he
observe
that
the
princess
elene
grew
pale
and
trembled
for
her
mother
sorrow
over
war
lived
again
in
her
heart
to
her
relief
he
came
at
last
to
the
end
of
his
recital
then
with
a
sigh
elene
turned
her
beautiful
eyes
upon
prince
lorenzo
and
what
have
you
to
tell
me
my
prince
for
answer
he
said
to
a
page
give
me
thy
harp
and
when
it
was
delivered
to
him
he
struck
the
strings
and
sang
in
the
hour
of
the
white
moths
flying
beneath
the
great
gray
moon
my
sad
heart
was
lest
love
should
come
too
soon
in
the
hour
of
the
flying
each
to
his
feathery
mate
my
sad
heart
was
lest
love
should
come
too
late
thy
spirit
heard
my
voicing
and
bade
me
cease
from
fears
and
follow
thee
rejoicing
beyond
all
time
and
tears
it
is
a
beautiful
song
said
the
princess
and
it
would
be
sweet
to
follow
someone
beyond
time
and
tears
then
prince
tristan
and
prince
martin
looked
enviously
at
prince
lorenzo
and
prince
martin
said
contemptuously
i
did
not
know
that
thou
wert
a
minstrel
thou
mayst
yet
discover
that
i
am
a
shoemaker
returned
lorenzo
also
if
there
were
no
carpenters
in
the
world
we
should
all
be
houseless
a
carpenter
may
indeed
be
of
more
use
than
a
princeling
tristan
looked
at
elene
to
see
how
she
bore
the
shock
of
hearing
such
people
mentioned
as
carpenters
and
shoemakers
but
she
was
smiling
as
if
lorenzo
words
pleased
her
the
three
princes
stayed
on
at
the
castle
and
the
court
was
very
gay
only
king
theophile
heart
was
heavy
for
he
knew
that
he
must
lose
his
most
beautiful
daughter
she
was
equally
kind
to
all
her
suitors
and
he
could
not
discover
which
prince
she
favored
so
one
evening
he
came
to
her
in
her
octagon
room
which
was
of
white
ivory
and
whose
windows
were
hung
with
coral
silk
and
he
found
her
spinning
with
her
maidens
her
robe
of
lace
rippled
about
her
little
feet
and
the
band
of
sapphires
which
held
back
her
yellow
hair
were
not
as
blue
as
her
eyes
king
theophile
dismissed
the
maidens
and
seating
himself
beside
his
daughter
he
took
her
hand
and
said
o
ray
of
sunlight
out
of
a
great
sorrow
tell
me
in
the
name
of
thy
dead
mother
to
whom
thou
hast
given
thine
heart
but
the
princess
veiled
her
eyes
and
drooped
her
head
for
a
burden
was
upon
her
soul
my
father
she
said
a
prince
can
not
easily
be
a
lover
for
love
has
but
one
object
and
in
the
life
of
a
prince
are
many
objects
i
would
be
loved
but
fine
words
are
no
proof
of
a
heart
prince
tristan
is
a
noble
youth
he
is
too
fond
of
killing
replied
elene
king
theophile
cheeks
grew
pale
for
he
thought
of
the
wars
and
men
asleep
in
crimson
meadows
that
had
once
been
green
prince
martin
is
a
gallant
lad
he
would
rather
contend
with
others
than
with
himself
said
the
princess
as
for
prince
lorenzo
he
dreams
too
much
dreamers
oft
know
more
than
those
who
are
awake
replied
elene
king
theophile
sighed
for
when
his
princess
spoke
in
this
wise
she
seemed
to
pass
from
his
arms
into
the
arms
of
her
dead
mother
now
when
elene
heard
him
sigh
her
heart
was
touched
for
she
loved
him
dearly
do
not
sigh
i
will
make
my
choice
and
this
will
be
the
manner
of
my
choosing
thou
knowst
my
tears
can
show
the
future
then
the
king
grew
pale
for
he
thought
of
the
mother
who
could
not
weep
until
the
little
daughter
was
laid
upon
her
breast
my
three
suitors
may
try
their
fortunes
through
my
tears
one
week
from
this
night
that
is
she
added
if
they
have
power
to
make
me
weep
he
who
beholds
me
weep
him
will
i
the
king
was
sad
when
he
heard
this
but
he
saw
it
was
her
will
and
refrained
from
protest
next
day
he
announced
to
the
court
and
to
the
three
suitors
through
what
means
the
princess
elene
would
make
her
decision
from
that
day
on
elene
saw
little
of
the
three
princes
for
prince
lorenzo
was
wandering
off
in
the
forests
alone
and
prince
martin
and
prince
tristan
were
trying
pathos
on
the
maids
of
honor
each
vying
with
the
other
to
tell
the
saddest
tales
they
succeeded
so
well
that
the
noble
maidens
nearly
cried
their
eyes
out
king
theophile
was
much
embarrassed
to
come
in
his
walks
upon
a
little
maid
of
honor
weeping
into
her
handkerchief
while
a
prince
discoursed
at
her
feet
at
last
the
week
wore
away
and
the
court
assembled
for
what
someone
called
the
trial
of
tears
a
thousand
wax
candles
were
lit
in
the
glittering
throne
room
king
theophile
sat
upon
his
throne
and
on
his
right
hand
was
the
princess
elene
crowned
with
white
roses
and
robed
in
white
silk
which
had
a
shimmer
of
gold
in
its
folds
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
sat
the
three
princes
when
all
were
assembled
the
king
arose
and
announced
the
intention
of
the
princess
to
give
her
hand
to
him
who
should
behold
in
her
tears
her
wedding
prince
tristan
was
the
first
to
try
his
fortune
he
had
chosen
the
tale
of
a
young
girl
cruelly
turned
adrift
in
a
forest
and
left
there
to
die
and
he
related
it
with
every
circumstance
that
could
render
it
more
piteous
soon
every
lady
in
the
court
was
weeping
but
to
the
eyes
of
the
princess
elene
came
no
tears
which
made
prince
tristan
angry
so
that
he
finished
his
tale
in
a
sullen
muttering
voice
then
prince
martin
rose
and
told
a
story
of
little
children
who
had
climbed
into
a
boat
which
the
rising
tide
seized
and
carried
out
to
sea
they
were
too
little
to
be
afraid
and
only
when
starvation
seized
them
did
they
begin
to
wail
for
their
mothers
this
story
related
in
a
soft
melancholy
voice
touched
all
hearts
and
through
the
court
there
was
the
sound
of
weeping
but
the
princess
gazed
straight
before
her
and
her
eyes
were
dry
prince
martin
ended
his
tale
with
real
sadness
for
he
saw
that
the
princess
elene
was
unmoved
by
his
narrative
and
with
drooping
head
he
returned
to
his
seat
then
rose
prince
lorenzo
and
bowed
low
before
the
princess
even
to
win
you
he
said
i
would
not
have
you
shed
tears
for
you
have
been
made
to
shed
too
many
in
your
short
life
he
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
the
princess
lip
quivered
like
that
of
a
little
child
and
sudden
tears
welled
up
in
her
eyes
as
they
fell
lorenzo
went
quickly
to
her
and
gazing
upon
her
face
gave
a
cry
of
joy
o
my
love
he
exclaimed
i
see
thee
all
in
a
white
veil
and
i
am
by
thy
side
then
smiling
through
her
tears
she
arose
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
the
court
knew
that
he
was
the
chosen
one
he
knelt
before
her
and
kissed
her
hand
while
the
heralds
proclaimed
him
the
victor
so
they
were
married
and
lived
happily
ever
afterwards
for
she
was
a
true
princess
and
he
was
a
true
prince
the
golden
archer
in
the
midst
of
a
plain
stood
a
great
church
built
of
white
stones
with
a
massive
tower
on
this
tower
was
a
weather
vane
in
the
shape
of
a
golden
man
who
rode
a
golden
horse
and
made
ready
to
shoot
a
golden
arrow
only
the
arrow
never
left
the
bow
but
pointed
always
to
the
direction
from
which
the
wind
blew
north
from
the
mountains
east
from
the
sea
west
from
the
plain
south
from
the
waving
forests
now
the
archer
looked
very
small
from
the
court
in
front
of
the
cathedral
because
he
was
up
so
high
in
the
air
so
high
indeed
that
often
the
lightning
passed
through
his
body
in
reality
he
was
not
small
but
and
he
had
once
been
a
man
but
now
he
was
a
weather
vane
because
he
had
made
a
vow
to
dwell
forever
on
the
tower
and
show
the
people
from
which
direction
came
the
winds
for
the
reason
that
he
had
a
man
heart
in
his
golden
body
life
was
not
always
easy
for
him
up
there
in
the
high
place
and
his
eyes
would
sweep
the
far
horizons
in
search
of
someone
to
companion
him
but
no
living
thing
passed
by
him
but
the
beautiful
who
had
learned
that
his
golden
arrow
would
never
pierce
their
breasts
and
so
they
loved
him
and
perched
upon
his
arm
that
drew
the
bow
even
the
winds
were
kind
to
him
because
he
moved
so
easily
at
their
behest
but
all
winds
were
not
alike
to
him
who
had
the
heart
of
a
man
when
spring
came
and
the
breezes
blew
from
the
south
heavy
with
the
scent
of
magnolia
of
lilacs
and
blue
violets
the
heart
of
the
golden
archer
ached
with
a
strange
hurt
out
of
vanished
years
that
he
quite
remember
when
summer
brought
to
him
the
delicious
odor
of
grapes
and
berries
and
strong
bright
flowers
he
longed
to
go
down
from
the
tower
and
wander
after
the
fireflies
lanterns
among
the
loaded
vines
or
pillow
his
head
on
sweet
hay
and
let
the
winds
put
him
to
sleep
forever
when
autumn
came
and
the
flying
leaves
as
golden
as
his
own
steed
looked
like
yellow
butterflies
too
tired
to
move
their
wings
the
archer
would
think
of
fires
on
hearths
only
half
remembered
and
he
wished
he
could
stable
his
golden
horse
while
he
joined
some
group
about
the
dancing
flames
winter
was
hardest
of
all
to
him
for
all
the
world
went
and
left
him
lonely
the
that
glided
down
the
blue
rays
of
the
with
their
little
lanterns
that
gave
much
color
but
no
heat
these
little
creatures
could
not
comfort
him
because
though
he
rode
so
high
and
was
so
straight
still
he
had
the
heart
of
a
man
sometimes
the
wild
snows
came
and
blinded
his
steady
sorrowful
eyes
and
in
blackest
midnight
when
the
sleet
rattled
against
the
golden
sides
of
his
horse
then
indeed
he
felt
alone
and
forgotten
for
the
people
on
the
plain
though
they
looked
to
his
guiding
arrow
did
not
love
him
because
they
thought
him
only
a
weather
vane
so
the
years
drove
on
and
the
golden
archer
grew
lonelier
and
lonelier
came
at
last
a
spring
when
the
scent
of
was
like
the
hurt
of
too
great
joy
and
the
splashed
the
land
with
pink
high
up
in
the
air
the
archer
looked
wistfully
southward
and
pointed
his
bow
towards
clouds
of
sweetness
and
how
he
longed
to
leave
the
great
white
stones
of
the
tower
and
go
wandering
through
those
creamy
orchards
and
down
the
green
aisles
of
the
forests
by
bright
refreshing
streams
as
he
was
gazing
one
day
over
the
fertile
plain
he
saw
moving
upon
it
what
looked
to
him
from
that
height
like
a
very
little
girl
but
he
knew
that
she
must
be
really
a
tall
slender
maiden
that
she
had
golden
hair
he
also
knew
because
it
gleamed
in
the
sun
then
his
lonely
heart
desired
her
company
and
he
sent
out
thoughts
to
her
for
being
an
archer
he
could
do
this
thoughts
were
his
real
arrows
so
this
thought
he
sent
towards
her
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
but
i
am
a
lonely
archer
on
the
great
cathedral
where
i
have
made
a
vow
to
tell
forever
the
wandering
of
the
wind
i
can
not
come
to
thee
but
climb
the
winding
stairs
to
this
high
place
that
i
may
gaze
upon
thee
i
am
lonely
now
the
young
girl
was
walking
at
sunset
in
the
orchards
with
her
betrothed
when
through
the
air
this
message
came
to
her
and
lifting
up
her
eyes
she
said
see
where
the
last
light
lies
on
the
golden
archer
how
graceful
he
is
like
a
bit
of
flame
above
the
old
white
church
they
say
the
view
is
fine
from
there
answered
her
sweetheart
let
us
climb
up
proposed
the
maid
whose
name
was
felice
so
next
day
at
sunset
she
and
her
betrothed
climbed
the
winding
stair
of
the
cathedral
and
emerged
on
the
roof
near
the
golden
archer
who
when
he
saw
the
maiden
felt
an
old
rapture
sweep
over
him
for
a
moment
he
so
forgot
his
vow
that
he
stood
quite
still
though
the
wind
was
veering
how
beautiful
she
was
with
all
the
beauty
of
the
sweet
earth
from
which
he
had
been
so
long
removed
her
hair
was
like
and
her
eyes
were
like
dim
places
where
violets
hide
the
soft
voice
of
her
was
as
music
in
the
archer
ears
who
had
heard
too
long
the
jangling
of
iron
bells
in
the
towers
beneath
him
and
now
she
was
looking
at
him
old
memories
stirred
in
him
beneath
the
armor
that
hid
his
manhood
he
wanted
to
get
down
from
his
golden
horse
and
lay
aside
his
bow
and
arrow
and
take
her
in
his
arms
what
a
beautiful
archer
she
was
saying
how
crisp
his
hair
how
clear
and
firm
his
lips
how
pure
his
profile
now
her
betrothed
could
be
jealous
even
of
a
weather
vane
so
he
said
anyone
can
be
beautiful
who
is
made
of
metal
it
is
an
imperishable
beauty
she
replied
flesh
and
blood
decay
the
golden
archer
was
so
agitated
that
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
and
all
at
once
she
knew
that
he
was
alive
and
her
heart
was
aflame
with
love
for
him
next
day
she
came
alone
to
the
tower
she
found
him
pointing
north
and
looking
away
from
her
for
the
vow
had
gripped
him
again
like
the
frosts
of
winter
but
she
spoke
softly
and
said
beloved
the
spring
is
here
then
the
south
wind
came
and
against
his
will
he
veered
and
looked
at
her
she
came
close
to
his
golden
horse
and
touched
the
arm
that
held
the
bow
you
drew
me
to
you
and
now
you
do
not
look
at
me
she
said
i
am
afraid
to
look
at
you
he
replied
and
dropped
his
golden
eyelids
yet
you
are
not
afraid
to
gaze
into
the
sky
she
ventured
out
of
the
sky
will
come
nothing
to
harm
me
he
answered
could
i
harm
you
soul
of
my
soul
she
cried
you
could
make
me
love
you
was
his
answer
so
they
were
quiet
for
a
while
she
watched
the
circle
about
his
shining
horse
which
seemed
ever
ready
to
plunge
from
the
cathedral
tower
into
the
spaces
of
the
air
yet
remained
always
the
toy
of
the
winds
she
listened
to
the
hoarse
voices
of
the
huge
bells
that
swung
beneath
her
at
last
she
rose
and
unbound
her
hair
so
that
it
floated
like
a
golden
banner
in
the
wind
come
she
whispered
then
the
golden
archer
felt
all
the
pain
of
those
who
must
turn
away
from
the
voice
of
love
his
eyes
looked
towards
the
sunset
but
his
heart
seemed
drowning
in
a
strange
sweet
throbbing
darkness
come
nearer
he
whispered
so
she
went
so
near
that
her
golden
hair
floated
all
about
him
and
he
saw
the
landscape
through
a
yellow
cloud
kiss
me
she
said
but
he
set
his
lips
steadfastly
and
tried
to
turn
to
the
north
which
he
could
not
do
for
the
wind
was
steadily
from
the
south
i
am
cold
she
whispered
let
us
go
down
to
the
warm
orchards
go
he
answered
for
your
words
pierce
my
heart
and
i
have
made
a
vow
to
tell
the
people
about
the
coming
and
going
of
the
great
winds
my
love
is
a
great
wind
she
said
then
sadly
she
left
him
he
was
alone
on
his
tower
and
night
was
coming
he
tried
to
think
of
his
vow
but
her
eyes
called
him
her
lips
brushed
his
like
the
light
wing
of
a
nesting
bird
hour
after
hour
he
endured
the
pain
and
at
last
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
and
melted
his
armor
the
golden
archer
felt
his
old
humanity
return
like
a
flood
and
set
him
free
and
in
the
silence
that
comes
before
the
dawn
he
got
down
from
his
horse
the
limbs
of
the
golden
animal
were
moving
also
and
stealthily
with
the
cramped
action
of
those
too
long
in
one
position
horse
and
man
went
down
the
stairs
of
the
church
through
the
stone
vestibule
and
out
into
the
sweet
warm
plain
the
golden
archer
knelt
beneath
the
stars
and
wept
himself
back
to
his
old
beautiful
manhood
then
mounting
his
horse
he
galloped
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
in
a
cottage
smothered
beneath
roses
and
honeysuckle
felice
lived
once
at
her
window
he
whispered
the
golden
archer
has
come
for
thee
dearest
then
she
came
out
trembling
and
in
the
gray
light
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
comforted
her
we
will
ride
away
and
be
married
he
said
then
he
lifted
her
on
his
horse
and
they
rode
away
through
the
forest
she
lying
quite
still
against
his
heart
and
gazing
with
eyes
into
the
green
dimness
so
they
came
to
a
church
and
were
married
that
night
they
went
to
an
inn
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
an
old
house
with
nine
gables
deep
moss
on
the
roof
and
a
creaking
signboard
with
a
crowing
bird
painted
on
it
and
the
inn
was
called
the
crowing
cock
now
there
were
many
countrymen
seated
in
the
and
as
the
golden
archer
entered
the
room
everyone
rose
and
bowed
and
as
they
passed
through
felice
heard
a
peasant
say
how
strange
that
a
prince
should
marry
a
then
the
hot
color
came
into
her
face
for
felice
was
very
proud
and
did
not
like
to
be
thought
inferior
to
her
husband
when
they
were
alone
together
she
related
what
she
had
heard
the
golden
archer
looked
puzzled
for
he
thought
that
she
loved
him
too
well
to
care
for
such
trifles
we
are
one
because
we
are
dear
to
each
other
he
cried
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
cherished
her
next
day
came
the
mistress
of
the
inn
to
set
the
room
in
order
and
as
she
bustled
about
she
said
from
what
kingdom
comes
your
husband
the
prince
my
husband
is
not
a
prince
said
felice
he
talks
and
acts
like
one
remarked
the
hostess
what
is
he
then
the
little
felice
felt
her
cheeks
burn
she
could
not
say
that
her
husband
had
been
a
weather
vane
and
was
now
a
man
so
she
replied
he
occupied
a
very
high
position
of
trust
yet
he
seems
to
know
as
little
of
real
life
as
a
prince
mused
the
hostess
he
has
asked
me
strange
questions
about
quite
ordinary
things
felice
grew
pinker
than
ever
and
when
the
golden
archer
came
into
the
room
he
found
her
in
tears
heart
dearest
why
do
you
weep
he
said
then
she
told
him
her
trouble
he
must
act
like
other
people
she
said
or
tongues
would
begin
to
wag
he
must
forget
that
he
had
ever
been
a
weather
vane
and
must
learn
the
ways
of
the
world
the
golden
heart
was
wounded
by
her
words
do
you
remember
he
said
that
you
called
your
love
for
me
a
great
wind
yes
i
remember
a
great
wind
blows
everything
before
it
even
the
words
of
men
now
felice
was
a
woman
who
catches
up
phrases
too
easily
and
speaks
them
too
trippingly
so
she
answered
if
you
love
me
you
will
do
anything
for
me
for
that
was
her
test
of
love
that
whoever
cared
for
her
should
bend
ever
to
her
will
we
must
serve
each
other
said
the
archer
to
whom
the
winds
in
all
those
years
had
whispered
many
secrets
when
equality
in
love
or
friendship
ceases
the
end
of
joy
is
near
but
remove
the
cloud
from
your
forehead
dear
love
and
let
us
hunt
the
blue
gentians
in
the
forest
glades
oh
no
let
us
go
to
the
village
fair
said
felice
what
exchange
those
cool
dim
places
for
the
glare
and
noise
of
a
fair
no
one
can
see
me
in
the
forest
remarked
felice
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
gazing
in
a
mirror
but
i
see
you
is
that
enough
felice
sighed
for
she
liked
admiration
and
the
golden
archer
said
no
more
about
gathering
gentians
but
went
with
her
to
the
fair
which
was
a
sacrifice
for
he
loved
fresh
air
and
solitude
and
the
crowds
the
heat
and
the
dust
made
his
head
ache
then
too
he
was
not
used
to
fairs
and
more
than
once
made
felice
uncomfortable
by
the
questions
he
asked
she
was
always
afraid
that
he
would
betray
his
origin
when
anyone
spoke
of
the
wind
someone
indeed
said
it
was
south
and
the
golden
archer
with
a
smile
corrected
him
it
is
east
he
remarked
oh
what
difference
does
it
make
felice
cried
crossly
her
increased
because
people
looked
more
at
her
husband
than
at
her
the
golden
archer
was
indeed
very
handsome
and
he
had
lived
so
much
in
the
skies
that
he
had
a
fine
free
air
people
could
take
long
breaths
in
his
presence
instead
of
feeling
choked
and
cramped
so
they
wanted
to
talk
with
him
he
would
have
been
glad
to
gratify
them
but
his
wife
drooping
lips
closed
his
own
and
after
a
while
both
went
sadly
back
to
the
inn
wondering
why
all
the
glory
was
gone
from
the
day
but
in
their
room
he
drew
her
into
his
arms
and
loved
her
anew
and
talked
to
her
of
all
the
wonderful
things
that
would
come
to
them
if
they
were
faithful
do
you
know
sweet
felice
he
said
that
love
is
like
the
seed
in
the
ground
which
comes
up
a
little
frail
and
tender
plant
but
through
storm
and
sunshine
grows
into
a
great
tree
we
must
be
patient
with
each
other
felice
was
of
those
who
want
their
trees
and
she
began
to
wonder
why
she
had
married
the
golden
archer
instead
of
her
own
man
whom
she
could
understand
and
she
wished
that
she
had
never
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
lost
her
heart
to
the
archer
the
days
of
their
honeymoon
dragged
for
the
archer
in
addition
to
the
hurt
of
his
love
had
now
to
suffer
the
pain
of
estrangement
the
more
he
cared
for
felice
the
harder
it
was
to
see
her
restless
and
unhappy
it
will
be
different
when
we
are
in
our
own
home
he
would
say
to
himself
so
one
day
they
left
the
inn
and
went
to
their
own
cottage
which
stood
on
a
little
hill
and
from
the
window
could
be
seen
the
tower
of
the
great
white
church
now
the
golden
archer
used
often
to
gaze
at
this
tower
which
made
felice
ask
him
if
he
were
homesick
no
but
i
miss
the
great
winds
he
replied
do
you
know
what
people
say
she
asked
him
what
do
they
say
that
you
were
struck
by
lightning
and
all
melted
away
i
was
struck
by
lightning
he
answered
love
slew
me
this
pleased
her
for
awhile
she
showed
herself
loving
and
tender
but
because
she
obeyed
moods
and
not
a
strong
steadfast
will
the
old
unhappiness
came
back
the
golden
archer
felt
more
lonely
than
ever
he
had
done
on
the
high
white
tower
and
loneliest
of
all
when
he
held
her
in
his
arms
one
day
he
found
her
crying
why
do
you
cry
beloved
he
asked
her
i
am
lonely
she
said
with
me
yes
she
sobbed
with
you
what
have
you
to
tell
me
but
your
tales
of
the
great
winds
other
men
have
had
their
friends
their
adventures
they
can
relate
stories
of
their
boyhood
of
their
early
life
but
you
came
from
a
tower
and
know
nothing
of
the
world
it
is
true
he
murmured
i
can
only
tell
you
of
the
skies
for
all
the
time
of
my
former
days
on
earth
is
dim
to
me
that
night
they
sat
before
the
fire
for
it
was
now
autumn
and
the
leaping
flames
showed
her
gold
hair
and
her
eyes
like
dark
pools
upon
the
golden
archer
they
shone
too
where
he
sat
still
and
hurt
but
unable
to
tell
his
pain
because
he
had
lived
too
high
above
the
world
the
low
hoarse
winds
drove
the
flying
leaves
against
the
window
glass
and
whistled
in
the
keyhole
at
which
felice
would
shiver
and
cast
sidelong
glances
at
her
strange
husband
all
at
once
on
the
wind
came
a
caroling
voice
felice
rushed
to
the
window
and
peered
out
the
voice
sang
all
that
i
knew
of
thee
my
love
the
great
winds
bore
away
when
they
are
hushed
wilt
thou
return
to
bless
the
close
of
day
in
that
still
hour
come
back
to
me
and
find
thy
rest
poor
petal
blown
too
near
the
sun
float
downward
to
my
breast
ah
cried
felice
it
is
my
old
love
my
love
for
thee
is
older
than
the
moon
said
the
golden
archer
can
you
not
rest
by
our
hearth
then
she
knelt
by
him
and
pressed
her
face
against
his
knees
and
his
heart
grew
as
heavy
as
a
weary
dream
before
a
sultry
dawn
when
the
thunder
hangs
in
the
hills
her
grief
weighed
all
the
more
upon
him
because
he
knew
she
was
trying
to
love
him
and
when
that
hour
of
effort
comes
death
is
under
its
cloak
but
the
next
day
she
was
cheerful
and
sang
about
her
tasks
the
golden
archer
saddled
his
horse
and
rode
miles
through
the
forest
upon
the
crisp
red
leaves
and
he
knew
that
goodness
would
not
hold
her
nor
kindness
nor
fidelity
nor
service
for
love
like
hers
is
held
prisoner
to
nothing
once
its
wings
are
outstretched
nor
does
it
know
good
from
evil
illustration
the
golden
archer
and
felice
when
he
rode
home
the
stars
were
peeping
through
the
forest
branches
and
the
white
owls
were
flying
but
the
frost
that
silvered
the
red
leaves
was
not
so
sharp
and
glistening
as
the
memory
of
her
tears
as
he
reached
his
door
he
saw
that
it
was
open
and
the
light
from
the
fire
shone
out
upon
the
dark
paths
of
the
forest
but
the
room
was
empty
of
her
presence
he
called
her
name
but
no
answer
was
returned
then
on
a
tablet
upon
the
table
he
saw
words
written
and
brought
them
to
the
fire
and
read
them
o
golden
archer
go
back
to
thy
tower
for
the
great
winds
have
taken
me
on
a
long
journey
and
i
shall
never
see
thee
again
then
he
knew
that
not
his
faithful
winds
but
the
voice
of
old
memories
had
called
her
and
he
bowed
his
head
in
an
imperishable
sorrow
because
his
heart
was
broken
he
desired
to
cease
from
his
humanity
and
return
to
the
old
white
tower
as
once
his
warm
tears
had
thawed
his
shining
armor
and
made
him
an
inhabitant
of
the
world
so
now
his
cold
and
bitter
tears
encased
him
again
in
hard
metal
walking
wearily
and
with
stiff
footsteps
he
went
to
the
stable
brought
out
his
horse
and
rode
across
the
plain
to
the
great
white
church
upon
which
the
midnight
moon
was
shining
he
knocked
on
its
west
door
and
from
the
vaults
came
the
echoes
you
can
not
return
golden
archer
for
you
have
broken
your
vow
but
i
have
broken
my
heart
also
he
answered
therefore
let
me
in
but
you
will
come
down
again
from
the
tower
cried
the
echoes
nay
for
only
the
know
how
to
keep
their
vows
he
answered
so
the
doors
swung
open
and
up
the
dim
spiral
stairs
rode
the
golden
archer
through
bars
of
moonlight
to
the
region
of
the
great
winds
where
again
he
mounted
the
tower
but
always
there
is
one
dream
left
to
the
sorrowful
and
his
was
that
some
night
the
great
winds
would
drive
her
soul
against
his
breast
then
he
became
very
still
and
turned
his
arrow
northward
for
the
wind
was
coming
from
the
far
circles
of
the
arctic
ice
next
day
the
sun
rose
red
and
glorious
and
made
fires
on
the
armor
of
the
golden
archer
and
all
the
people
upon
the
plain
rubbed
their
eyes
and
cried
out
there
a
new
archer
on
the
cathedral
now
we
shall
know
from
which
horizon
comes
the
wind
