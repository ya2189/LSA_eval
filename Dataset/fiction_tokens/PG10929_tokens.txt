the

was

now
do
not
courteous
reader
toss
your
head
contemptuously
and
exclaim
of
course
he
was
i
could
have
told
that
you
know
very
well
that
you
have
often
seen
a
man
above
six
feet
high
broad
and
powerful
as
a
lion
with
a
bronzed
shaggy
visage
and
the
stern
glance
of
an
eagle
of
whom
you
have
said
or
thought
or
heard
others
say
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
believe
that
such
a
man
was
once
a
squalling
baby
if
you
had
seen
our
hero
in
all
the
strength
and
majesty
of
doghood
you
would
have
experienced
a
vague
sort
of
surprise
had
we
told
you
as
we
now
repeat
that
the
dog
crusoe
was
once
a
pup
a
soft
round
sprawling
squeaking
pup
as
fat
as
a
tallow
candle
and
as
blind
as
a
bat
but
we
draw
particular
attention
to
the
fact
of
crusoe
having
once
been
a
pup
because
in
connection
with
the
days
of
his
puppyhood
there
hangs
a
tale
this
peculiar
dog
may
thus
be
said
to
have
had
two
tails
one
in
connection
with
his
body
the
other
with
his
career
this
tale
though
short
is
very
harrowing
and
as
it
is
intimately
connected
with
crusoe
subsequent
history
we
will
relate
it
here
but
before
doing
so
we
must
beg
our
reader
to
accompany
us
beyond
the
civilized
portions
of
the
united
states
of
america
beyond
the
frontier
settlements
of
the
far
west
into
those
wild
prairies
which
are
watered
by
the
great
missouri
river
the
father
of
waters
and
his
numerous
tributaries
here
dwell
the
pawnees
the
sioux
the
delawarers
the
crows
the
blackfeet
and
many
other
tribes
of
red
indians
who
are
gradually
retreating
step
by
step
towards
the
rocky
mountains
as
the
advancing
white
man
cuts
down
their
trees
and
ploughs
up
their
prairies
here
too
dwell
the
wild
horse
and
the
wild
ass
the
deer
the
buffalo
and
the
badger
all
men
and
brutes
alike
wild
as
the
power
of
untamed
and
ungovernable
passion
can
make
them
and
free
as
the
wind
that
sweeps
over
their
mighty
plains
there
is
a
romantic
and
exquisitely
beautiful
spot
on
the
banks
of
one
of
the
tributaries
above
referred
to
long
stretch
of
mingled
woodland
and
meadow
with
a
magnificent
lake
lying
like
a
gem
in
its
green
bosom
which
goes
by
the
name
of
the
mustang
valley
this
remote
vale
even
at
the
present
day
is
but
thinly
peopled
by
white
men
and
is
still
a
frontier
settlement
round
which
the
wolf
and
the
bear
prowl
curiously
and
from
which
the
startled
deer
bounds
terrified
away
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
the
valley
had
just
been
taken
possession
of
by
several
families
of
squatters
who
tired
of
the
turmoil
and
the
squabbles
of
the
frontier
settlements
had
pushed
boldly
into
the
far
west
to
seek
a
new
home
for
themselves
where
they
could
have
elbow
room
regardless
alike
of
the
dangers
they
might
encounter
in
unknown
lands
and
of
the
redskins
who
dwelt
there
the
squatters
were
well
armed
with
axes
rifles
and
ammunition
most
of
the
women
were
used
to
dangers
and
alarms
and
placed
implicit
reliance
in
the
power
of
their
fathers
husbands
and
brothers
to
protect
them
and
well
they
might
for
a
bolder
set
of
stalwart
men
than
these
backwoodsmen
never
trod
the
wilderness
each
had
been
trained
to
the
use
of
the
rifle
and
the
axe
from
infancy
and
many
of
them
had
spent
so
much
of
their
lives
in
the
woods
that
they
were
more
than
a
match
for
the
indian
in
his
own
peculiar
pursuits
of
hunting
and
war
when
the
squatters
first
issued
from
the
woods
bordering
the
valley
an
immense
herd
of
wild
horses
or
mustangs
were
browsing
on
the
plain
these
no
sooner
beheld
the
cavalcade
of
white
men
than
uttering
a
wild
neigh
they
tossed
their
flowing
manes
in
the
breeze
and
dashed
away
like
a
whirlwind
this
incident
procured
the
valley
its
name
the
gave
one
satisfied
glance
at
their
future
home
and
then
set
to
work
to
erect
log
huts
forthwith
soon
the
axe
was
heard
ringing
through
the
forests
and
tree
after
tree
fell
to
the
ground
while
the
occasional
sharp
ring
of
a
rifle
told
that
the
hunters
were
catering
successfully
for
the
camp
in
course
of
time
the
mustang
valley
began
to
assume
the
aspect
of
a
thriving
settlement
with
cottages
and
waving
fields
clustered
together
in
the
midst
of
it
of
course
the
savages
soon
found
it
out
and
paid
it
occasional
visits
these
tenants
of
the
woods
brought
furs
of
wild
animals
with
them
which
they
exchanged
with
the
white
men
for
knives
and
beads
and
baubles
and
trinkets
of
brass
and
tin
but
they
hated
the
with
bitter
hatred
because
their
encroachments
had
at
this
time
materially
curtailed
the
extent
of
their
and
nothing
but
the
numbers
and
known
courage
of
the
squatters
prevented
these
savages
from
butchering
and
scalping
them
all
the
leader
of
this
band
of
pioneers
was
a
major
hope
a
gentleman
whose
love
for
nature
in
its
wildest
aspects
determined
him
to
exchange
barrack
life
for
a
life
in
the
woods
the
major
was
a
shot
a
bold
fearless
man
and
an
enthusiastic
naturalist
he
was
past
the
prime
of
life
and
being
a
bachelor
was
unencumbered
with
a
family
his
first
act
on
reaching
the
site
of
the
new
settlement
was
to
commence
the
erection
of
a
to
which
the
people
might
retire
in
case
of
a
general
attack
by
the
indians
in
this
major
hope
took
up
his
abode
as
the
guardian
of
the
settlement
and
here
the
dog
crusoe
was
born
here
he
sprawled
in
the
early
morn
of
life
here
he
leaped
and
yelped
and
wagged
his
shaggy
tail
in
the
excessive
glee
of
puppyhood
and
from
the
wooden
portals
of
this
he
bounded
forth
to
the
chase
in
all
the
fire
and
strength
and
majesty
of
doghood
crusoe
father
and
mother
were
magnificent
newfoundlanders
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
their
being
of
the
genuine
breed
for
major
hope
had
received
them
as
a
parting
gift
from
a
brother
officer
who
had
brought
them
both
from
newfoundland
itself
the
father
name
was
crusoe
the
mother
name
was
fan
why
the
father
had
been
so
called
no
one
could
tell
the
man
from
whom
major
hope
friend
had
obtained
the
pair
was
a
poor
illiterate
fisherman
who
had
never
heard
of
the
celebrated
robinson
in
all
his
life
all
he
knew
was
that
fan
had
been
named
after
his
own
wife
as
for
crusoe
he
had
got
him
from
a
friend
who
had
got
him
from
another
friend
whose
cousin
had
received
him
as
a
from
a
friend
of
and
that
each
had
said
to
the
other
that
the
dog
name
was
crusoe
without
reasons
being
asked
or
given
on
either
side
on
arriving
at
new
york
the
friend
as
we
have
said
made
him
a
present
of
the
dogs
not
being
much
of
a
dog
fancier
he
soon
tired
of
old
crusoe
and
gave
him
away
to
a
gentleman
who
took
him
down
to
florida
and
that
was
the
end
of
him
he
was
never
heard
of
more
when
crusoe
junior
was
born
he
was
born
of
course
without
a
name
that
was
given
to
him
afterwards
in
honour
of
his
father
he
was
also
born
in
company
with
a
brother
and
two
sisters
all
of
whom
drowned
themselves
accidentally
in
the
first
month
of
their
existence
by
falling
into
the
river
which
flowed
past
the
a
calamity
which
occurred
doubtless
in
consequence
of
their
having
gone
out
without
their
mother
leave
little
crusoe
was
with
his
brother
and
sisters
at
the
time
and
fell
in
along
with
them
but
was
saved
from
sharing
their
fate
by
his
mother
who
seeing
what
had
happened
dashed
with
an
agonized
howl
into
the
water
and
seizing
him
in
her
mouth
brought
him
ashore
in
a
condition
she
afterwards
brought
the
others
ashore
one
by
one
but
the
poor
little
things
were
dead
and
now
we
come
to
the
harrowing
part
of
our
tale
for
the
proper
understanding
of
which
the
foregoing
dissertation
was
needful
one
beautiful
afternoon
in
that
charming
season
of
the
american
year
called
the
indian
summer
there
came
a
family
of
sioux
indians
to
the
mustang
valley
and
pitched
their
tent
close
to
the
a
young
hunter
stood
leaning
against
the
of
the
palisades
watching
the
movements
of
the
indians
who
having
just
finished
a
long
palaver
or
talk
with
major
hope
were
now
in
the
act
of
preparing
supper
a
fire
had
been
kindled
on
the
greensward
in
front
of
the
tent
and
above
it
stood
a
tripod
from
which
depended
a
large
tin
over
this
hung
an
indian
woman
or
squaw
who
besides
attending
to
the
contents
of
the
pot
bestowed
sundry
cuffs
and
kicks
upon
her
little
child
which
sat
near
to
her
playing
with
several
indian
curs
that
gambolled
round
the
fire
the
master
of
the
family
and
his
two
sons
reclined
on
buffalo
robes
smoking
their
stone
pipes
or
calumets
in
silence
there
was
nothing
peculiar
in
their
appearance
their
faces
were
neither
dignified
nor
coarse
in
expression
but
wore
an
aspect
of
stupid
apathy
which
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
countenance
of
the
young
hunter
who
seemed
an
amused
spectator
of
their
proceedings
the
youth
referred
to
was
very
unlike
in
many
respects
to
what
we
are
accustomed
to
suppose
a
backwoods
hunter
should
be
he
did
not
possess
that
quiet
gravity
and
staid
demeanour
which
often
characterize
these
men
true
he
was
tall
and
strongly
made
but
no
one
would
have
called
him
stalwart
and
his
frame
indicated
grace
and
agility
rather
than
strength
but
the
point
about
him
which
rendered
him
different
from
his
companions
was
his
bounding
irrepressible
flow
of
spirits
strangely
coupled
with
an
intense
love
of
solitary
wandering
in
the
woods
none
seemed
so
well
fitted
for
social
enjoyment
as
he
none
laughed
so
heartily
or
expressed
such
glee
in
his
eye
yet
for
days
together
he
went
off
alone
into
the
forest
and
wandered
where
his
fancy
led
him
as
grave
and
silent
as
an
indian
warrior
after
all
there
was
nothing
mysterious
in
this
the
boy
followed
implicitly
the
dictates
of
nature
within
him
he
was
amiable
straightforward
sanguine
and
intensely
when
he
laughed
he
let
it
out
as
sailors
have
it
with
a
will
when
there
was
good
cause
to
be
grave
no
power
on
earth
could
make
him
smile
we
have
called
him
boy
but
in
truth
he
was
about
that
uncertain
period
of
life
when
a
youth
is
said
to
be
neither
a
man
nor
a
boy
his
face
was
earnest
candid
face
is
and
masculine
his
hair
was
and
his
eye
he
was
costumed
in
the
deerskin
cap
leggings
moccasins
and
leathern
shirt
common
to
the
western
hunter
you
seem
tickled
wi
the
injuns
dick
varley
said
a
man
who
at
that
moment
issued
from
the
blockhouse
that
just
what
i
am
joe
blunt
replied
the
youth
turning
with
a
broad
grin
to
his
companion
have
a
care
lad
do
not
laugh
at
too
much
they
soon
take
offence
an
them
redskins
never
forgive
but
i
only
laughing
at
the
baby
returned
the
youth
pointing
to
the
child
which
with
a
mixture
of
boldness
and
timidity
was
playing
with
a
pup
wrinkling
up
its
fat
visage
into
a
smile
when
its
playmate
rushed
away
in
sport
and
opening
wide
its
eyes
in
grave
anxiety
as
the
pup
returned
at
full
gallop
it
make
an
owl
laugh
continued
young
varley
to
see
such
a
queer
pictur
o
itself
he
paused
suddenly
and
a
dark
frown
covered
his
face
as
he
saw
the
indian
woman
stoop
quickly
down
catch
the
pup
by
its
with
one
hand
seize
a
heavy
piece
of
wood
with
the
other
and
strike
it
several
violent
blows
on
the
throat
without
taking
the
trouble
to
kill
the
poor
animal
outright
the
savage
then
held
its
still
writhing
body
over
the
fire
in
order
to
singe
off
the
hair
before
putting
it
into
the
pot
to
be
cooked
the
cruel
act
drew
young
varley
attention
more
closely
to
the
pup
and
it
flashed
across
his
mind
that
this
could
be
no
other
than
young
crusoe
which
neither
he
nor
his
companion
had
before
seen
although
they
had
often
heard
others
speak
of
and
describe
it
had
the
little
creature
been
one
of
the
unfortunate
indian
curs
the
two
hunters
would
probably
have
turned
from
the
sickening
sight
with
disgust
feeling
that
however
much
they
might
dislike
such
cruelty
it
would
be
of
no
use
attempting
to
interfere
with
indian
usages
but
the
instant
the
idea
that
it
was
crusoe
occurred
to
varley
he
uttered
a
yell
of
anger
and
sprang
towards
the
woman
with
a
bound
that
caused
the
three
indians
to
leap
to
their
feet
and
grasp
their
tomahawks
blunt
did
not
move
from
the
gate
but
threw
forward
his
rifle
with
a
careless
motion
but
an
expressive
glance
that
caused
the
indians
to
resume
their
seats
and
pipes
with
an
emphatic
wah
of
disgust
at
having
been
startled
out
of
their
propriety
by
a
trifle
while
dick
varley
snatched
poor
crusoe
from
his
dangerous
and
painful
position
scowled
angrily
in
the
woman
face
and
turning
on
his
heel
walked
up
to
the
house
holding
the
pup
tenderly
in
his
arms
joe
blunt
gazed
after
his
friend
with
a
grave
solemn
expression
of
countenance
till
he
disappeared
then
he
looked
at
the
ground
and
shook
his
head
joe
was
one
of
the
regular
backwoods
hunters
both
in
appearance
and
in
fact
broad
tall
massive
gifted
with
the
hunting
stalking
running
and
powers
of
the
savage
and
with
a
superabundance
of
the
shooting
and
fighting
powers
the
daring
and
dash
of
the
he
was
grave
too
seldom
smiled
and
rarely
laughed
his
expression
almost
at
all
times
was
a
compound
of
seriousness
and
with
the
rifle
he
was
a
good
steady
shot
but
by
no
means
a
crack
one
his
ball
never
failed
to
but
it
often
failed
to
after
meditating
a
few
seconds
joe
blunt
again
shook
his
head
and
muttered
to
himself
the
boy
bold
enough
but
he
too
reckless
for
a
hunter
there
was
no
need
for
that
yell
now
none
at
all
having
uttered
this
sagacious
remark
he
threw
his
rifle
into
the
hollow
of
his
left
arm
turned
round
and
strode
off
with
a
long
slow
step
towards
his
own
cottage
blunt
was
an
american
by
birth
but
of
irish
extraction
and
to
an
attentive
ear
there
was
a
faint
echo
of
the
in
his
tone
which
seemed
to
have
been
handed
down
to
him
as
a
threadbare
and
almost
heirloom
poor
crusoe
was
singed
almost
naked
his
wretched
tail
seemed
little
better
than
a
piece
of
wire
filed
off
to
a
point
and
he
vented
his
misery
in
piteous
squeaks
as
the
sympathetic
varley
confided
him
tenderly
to
the
care
of
his
mother
how
fan
managed
to
cure
him
no
one
can
tell
but
cure
him
she
did
for
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
crusoe
was
as
well
and
sleek
and
fat
as
ever
chapter
ii
and
its
friends
introduced
to
the
and
his
mother
change
shortly
after
the
incident
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
the
squatters
of
the
mustang
valley
lost
their
leader
major
hope
suddenly
announced
his
intention
of
quitting
the
settlement
and
returning
to
the
civilized
world
private
matters
he
said
required
his
presence
there
matters
which
he
did
not
choose
to
speak
of
but
which
would
prevent
his
returning
again
to
reside
among
them
go
he
must
and
being
a
man
of
determination
go
he
did
but
before
going
he
distributed
all
his
goods
and
chattels
among
the
settlers
he
even
gave
away
his
rifle
and
fan
and
crusoe
these
last
however
he
resolved
should
go
together
and
as
they
were
well
worth
having
he
announced
that
he
would
give
them
to
the
best
shot
in
the
valley
he
stipulated
that
the
winner
should
escort
him
to
the
nearest
settlement
eastward
after
which
he
might
return
with
the
rifle
on
his
shoulder
accordingly
a
long
level
piece
of
ground
on
the
river
bank
with
a
perpendicular
cliff
at
the
end
of
it
was
selected
as
the
and
on
the
appointed
day
at
the
appointed
hour
the
competitors
began
to
assemble
well
lad
first
as
usual
exclaimed
joe
blunt
as
he
reached
the
ground
and
found
dick
varley
there
before
him
i
bin
here
more
than
an
hour
lookin
for
a
new
kind
o
flower
that
jack
morgan
told
me
he
seen
and
i
found
it
too
look
here
did
you
ever
see
one
like
it
before
blunt
leaned
his
rifle
against
a
tree
and
carefully
examined
the
flower
why
yes
i
seed
o
them
up
about
the
rocky
mountains
but
never
one
it
seems
to
have
gone
lost
itself
the
last
i
seed
if
i
remimber
rightly
wos
near
the
o
the
yellowstone
river
it
wos
jest
where
i
shot
a
grizzly
bar
was
that
the
bar
that
gave
you
the
wipe
on
the
cheek
asked
varley
forgetting
the
flower
in
his
interest
about
the
bear
it
wos
i
put
six
balls
in
that
bar
carcass
and
stuck
my
knife
into
its
heart
ten
times
afore
it
gave
out
an
it
nearly
ripped
the
shirt
off
my
back
afore
i
wos
done
with
it
i
would
give
my
rifle
to
get
a
chance
at
a
grizzly
exclaimed
varley
with
a
sudden
burst
of
enthusiasm
whoever
got
it
would
have
much
to
brag
of
remarked
a
burly
young
backwoodsman
as
he
joined
them
his
remark
was
true
for
poor
dick
weapon
was
but
a
sorry
affair
it
missed
fire
and
it
hung
fire
and
even
when
it
did
fire
it
remained
a
matter
of
doubt
in
its
owner
mind
whether
the
slight
deviations
from
the
direct
line
made
by
his
bullets
were
the
result
of
or
bad
shooting
further
comment
upon
it
was
checked
by
the
arrival
of
a
dozen
or
more
hunters
on
the
scene
of
action
they
were
a
sturdy
set
of
bronzed
bold
fearless
men
and
one
felt
on
looking
at
them
that
they
would
prove
more
than
a
match
for
several
hundreds
of
indians
in
open
fight
a
few
minutes
after
the
major
himself
came
on
the
ground
with
the
prize
rifle
on
his
shoulder
and
fan
and
crusoe
at
his
heels
the
latter
tumbling
scrambling
and
yelping
after
its
mother
fat
and
clumsy
and
happy
as
possible
having
evidently
quite
forgotten
that
it
had
been
nearly
roasted
alive
only
a
few
weeks
before
immediately
all
eyes
were
on
the
rifle
and
its
merits
were
discussed
with
animation
and
well
did
it
deserve
discussion
for
such
a
piece
had
never
before
been
seen
on
the
western
frontier
it
was
shorter
in
the
barrel
and
larger
in
the
bore
than
the
weapons
chiefly
in
vogue
at
that
time
and
besides
being
of
beautiful
workmanship
was
but
the
grand
peculiarity
about
it
and
that
which
afterwards
rendered
it
the
mystery
of
mysteries
to
the
savages
was
that
it
had
two
sets
of
locks
one
percussion
the
other
flint
so
that
when
caps
failed
by
taking
off
the
one
set
of
locks
and
affixing
the
others
it
was
converted
into
a
flint
rifle
the
major
however
took
care
never
to
run
short
of
caps
so
that
the
flint
locks
were
merely
held
as
a
reserve
in
case
of
need
now
lads
cried
major
hope
stepping
up
to
the
point
whence
they
were
to
shoot
remember
the
terms
he
who
first
drives
the
nail
obtains
the
rifle
fan
and
her
pup
and
accompanies
me
to
the
nearest
settlement
each
man
shoots
with
his
own
gun
and
draws
lots
for
the
chance
agreed
cried
the
men
well
then
wipe
your
guns
and
draw
lots
henri
will
fix
the
nail
here
it
is
the
individual
who
stepped
or
rather
plunged
forward
to
receive
the
nail
was
a
rare
and
remarkable
specimen
of
mankind
like
his
comrades
he
was
half
a
farmer
and
half
a
hunter
like
them
too
he
was
clad
in
deerskin
and
was
tall
and
strong
nay
more
he
was
gigantic
but
unlike
them
he
was
clumsy
awkward
and
a
bad
shot
nevertheless
henri
was
an
immense
favourite
in
the
settlement
for
his
knew
no
bounds
no
one
ever
saw
him
frown
even
when
fighting
with
the
savages
as
he
was
sometimes
compelled
to
do
in
he
went
at
them
with
a
sort
of
jovial
rage
that
was
almost
laughable
inconsiderate
recklessness
was
one
of
his
chief
characteristics
so
that
his
comrades
were
rather
afraid
of
him
on
the
or
in
the
hunt
where
caution
and
frequently
motion
were
essential
to
success
or
safety
but
when
henri
had
a
comrade
at
his
side
to
check
him
he
was
safe
enough
being
and
obedient
men
used
to
say
he
must
have
been
born
under
a
lucky
star
for
notwithstanding
his
natural
inaptitude
for
all
sorts
of
backwoods
life
he
managed
to
scramble
through
everything
with
safety
often
with
success
and
sometimes
with
credit
to
see
henri
stalk
a
deer
was
worth
a
long
day
journey
joe
blunt
used
to
say
he
was
all
jints
together
from
the
top
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
moccasin
he
threw
his
immense
form
into
the
most
inconceivable
contortions
and
slowly
wound
his
way
sometimes
on
hands
and
knees
sometimes
flat
through
bush
and
brake
as
if
there
was
not
a
bone
in
his
body
and
without
the
slightest
noise
this
sort
of
work
was
so
much
against
his
plunging
nature
that
he
took
long
to
learn
it
but
when
through
hard
practice
and
the
loss
of
many
a
fine
deer
he
came
at
length
to
break
himself
in
to
it
he
gradually
progressed
to
perfection
and
ultimately
became
the
best
stalker
in
the
valley
this
and
this
alone
enabled
him
to
procure
game
for
being
he
could
hit
nothing
beyond
fifty
yards
except
a
buffalo
or
a
yet
that
same
lithe
body
which
seemed
as
though
totally
unhinged
could
no
more
be
bent
when
the
muscles
were
strung
than
an
iron
post
no
one
wrestled
with
henri
unless
he
wished
to
have
his
back
broken
few
could
equal
and
none
could
beat
him
at
running
or
leaping
except
dick
varley
when
henri
ran
a
race
even
joe
blunt
laughed
outright
for
arms
and
legs
went
like
independent
flails
when
he
leaped
he
hurled
himself
into
space
with
a
degree
of
violence
that
seemed
to
insure
a
somersault
yet
he
always
came
down
with
a
crash
on
his
feet
plunging
was
henri
forte
he
generally
lounged
about
the
settlement
when
unoccupied
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
apparently
in
a
reverie
and
when
called
on
to
act
he
seemed
to
fancy
he
must
have
lost
time
and
could
only
make
up
for
it
by
this
habit
got
him
into
many
awkward
scrapes
but
his
herculean
power
as
often
got
him
out
of
them
he
was
a
and
a
particularly
bad
speaker
of
the
english
language
we
offer
no
apology
for
this
elaborate
introduction
of
henri
for
he
was
as
a
fellow
as
ever
lived
and
deserves
special
notice
but
to
return
the
sort
of
rifle
practice
called
driving
the
nail
by
which
this
match
was
to
be
decided
was
and
we
believe
still
is
common
among
the
hunters
of
the
far
west
it
consisted
in
this
an
ordinary
nail
was
driven
a
short
way
into
a
plank
or
a
tree
and
the
hunters
standing
at
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
or
so
fired
at
it
until
they
succeeded
in
driving
it
home
on
the
present
occasion
the
major
resolved
to
test
their
shooting
by
making
the
distance
seventy
yards
some
of
the
older
men
shook
their
heads
it
too
far
said
one
ye
might
as
well
try
to
snuff
the
nose
o
a
mosquito
jim
scraggs
is
the
only
man
as
hit
that
said
another
the
man
referred
to
was
a
long
lank
fellow
with
a
expression
of
countenance
he
used
the
long
heavy
kentucky
rifle
which
from
the
ball
being
little
larger
than
a
pea
was
called
a
jim
was
no
favourite
and
had
been
named
scraggs
by
his
companions
on
account
of
his
appearance
in
a
few
minutes
the
lots
were
drawn
and
the
shooting
began
each
hunter
wiped
out
the
barrel
of
his
piece
with
his
ramrod
as
he
stepped
forward
then
placing
a
ball
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
he
drew
the
stopper
of
his
with
his
teeth
and
poured
out
as
much
powder
as
sufficed
to
cover
the
bullet
this
was
the
regular
among
them
little
time
was
lost
in
firing
for
these
men
did
not
hang
on
their
aim
the
point
of
the
rifle
was
slowly
raised
to
the
object
and
the
instant
the
sight
covered
it
the
ball
sped
to
its
mark
in
a
few
minutes
the
nail
was
encircled
by
bullet
holes
scarcely
two
of
which
were
more
than
an
inch
distant
from
the
mark
and
one
fired
by
joe
blunt
entered
the
tree
close
beside
it
ah
joe
said
the
major
i
thought
you
would
have
carried
off
the
prize
so
did
not
i
sir
returned
blunt
with
a
shake
of
his
head
had
it
a
at
a
hundred
yards
i
ha
done
better
but
i
never
hit
the
nail
it
too
small
to
that
cos
ye
got
no
eyes
remarked
jim
scraggs
with
a
sneer
as
he
stepped
forward
all
tongues
were
now
hushed
for
the
expected
champion
was
about
to
fire
the
sharp
crack
of
the
rifle
was
followed
by
a
shout
for
jim
had
hit
the
on
the
edge
and
part
of
the
bullet
stuck
to
it
that
wins
if
there
no
better
said
the
major
scarce
able
to
conceal
his
disappointment
who
comes
next
to
this
question
henri
answered
by
stepping
up
to
the
line
straddling
his
legs
and
executing
preliminary
movements
with
his
rifle
that
seemed
to
indicate
an
intention
on
his
part
to
throw
the
weapon
bodily
at
the
mark
he
was
received
with
a
shout
of
mingled
laughter
and
applause
after
gazing
steadily
at
the
mark
for
a
few
seconds
a
broad
grin
overspread
his
countenance
and
looking
round
at
his
companions
he
said
ha
mes
boys
i
behold
de
nail
at
all
can
ye
the
shouted
a
voice
when
the
laugh
that
followed
this
announcement
had
somewhat
abated
oh
oui
replied
henri
quite
coolly
i
can
see
an
a
goot
small
bit
of
de
forest
beyond
fire
at
it
then
if
ye
hit
the
tree
ye
desarve
the
rifle
leastways
ye
ought
to
get
the
pup
henri
grinned
again
and
fired
instantly
without
taking
aim
the
shot
was
followed
by
an
exclamation
of
surprise
for
the
bullet
was
found
close
beside
the
nail
it
more
be
good
luck
than
good
shootin
remarked
jim
scraggs
possiblement
answered
henri
modestly
as
he
retreated
to
the
rear
and
wiped
out
his
rifle
mais
i
have
kill
most
of
my
deer
by
dat
same
goot
luck
bravo
henri
said
major
hope
as
he
passed
you
to
win
anyhow
who
next
dick
varley
cried
several
voices
where
varley
come
on
youngster
an
take
yer
shot
the
youth
came
forward
with
evident
reluctance
it
of
no
manner
use
he
whispered
to
joe
blunt
as
he
passed
i
ca
depend
on
my
old
gun
never
give
in
whispered
blunt
encouragingly
poor
varley
want
of
confidence
in
his
rifle
was
merited
for
on
pulling
the
trigger
the
faithless
lock
missed
fire
lend
him
another
gun
cried
several
voices
rules
laid
down
by
major
hope
said
scraggs
well
so
it
is
try
again
varley
did
try
again
and
so
successfully
too
that
the
ball
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
leaving
a
portion
of
the
lead
sticking
to
its
edge
of
course
this
was
greeted
with
a
cheer
and
a
loud
dispute
began
as
to
which
was
the
better
shot
of
the
two
there
are
others
to
shoot
yet
cried
the
major
make
way
look
out
the
men
fell
back
and
the
few
hunters
who
had
not
yet
fired
took
their
shots
but
without
coming
nearer
the
mark
it
was
now
agreed
that
jim
scraggs
and
dick
varley
being
the
two
best
shots
should
try
over
again
and
it
was
also
agreed
that
dick
should
have
the
use
of
blunt
rifle
lots
were
again
drawn
for
the
first
shot
and
it
fell
to
dick
who
immediately
stepped
out
aimed
somewhat
hastily
and
fired
hit
again
shouted
those
who
had
run
forward
to
examine
the
mark
the
bullet
cut
off
by
the
nail
head
some
of
the
more
enthusiastic
of
dick
friends
cheered
lustily
but
the
most
of
the
hunters
were
grave
and
silent
for
they
knew
powers
and
felt
that
he
would
certainly
do
his
best
jim
now
stepped
up
to
the
line
and
looking
earnestly
at
the
mark
threw
forward
his
rifle
at
that
moment
our
friend
crusoe
tired
of
tormenting
his
mother
waddled
stupidly
and
innocently
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
of
men
and
in
so
doing
received
henri
heel
and
the
full
weight
of
his
elephantine
body
on
its
fore
paw
the
horrible
and
electric
yell
that
instantly
issued
from
his
agonized
throat
could
only
be
compared
as
joe
blunt
expressed
it
to
the
last
dyin
screech
o
a
steam
biler
we
can
not
say
that
the
effect
was
startling
for
these
backwoodsmen
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
midst
of
alarms
and
were
so
used
to
them
that
a
bustin
steam
biler
itself
unless
it
had
blown
them
fairly
off
their
legs
would
not
have
startled
them
but
the
effect
such
as
it
was
was
sufficient
to
disconcert
the
aim
of
jim
scraggs
who
fired
at
the
same
instant
and
missed
the
nail
by
a
round
in
towering
wrath
scraggs
aimed
a
kick
at
the
poor
pup
which
had
it
taken
effect
would
certainly
have
terminated
the
innocent
existence
of
that
remarkable
dog
on
the
spot
but
quick
as
lightning
henri
interposed
the
butt
of
his
rifle
and
jim
shin
met
it
with
a
violence
that
caused
him
to
howl
with
rage
and
pain
oh
pardon
me
broder
cried
henri
shrinking
back
with
the
drollest
expression
of
mingled
pity
and
glee
jim
discretion
on
this
occasion
was
superior
to
his
valour
he
turned
away
with
a
coarse
expression
of
anger
and
left
the
ground
meanwhile
the
major
handed
the
silver
rifle
to
young
varley
it
could
have
fallen
into
better
hands
he
said
you
do
it
credit
lad
i
know
that
full
well
and
let
me
assure
you
it
will
never
play
you
false
only
keep
it
clean
do
overcharge
it
aim
true
and
it
will
never
miss
the
mark
while
the
hunters
crowded
round
dick
to
congratulate
him
and
examine
the
piece
he
stood
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
bashfulness
and
delight
at
his
unexpected
good
fortune
recovering
himself
suddenly
he
seized
his
old
rifle
and
dropping
quietly
to
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
while
the
men
were
still
busy
handling
and
discussing
the
merits
of
the
prize
went
up
unobserved
to
a
boy
of
about
thirteen
years
of
age
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
here
marston
you
know
i
often
said
ye
should
have
the
old
rifle
when
i
was
rich
enough
to
get
a
new
one
take
it
lad
it
come
to
ye
sooner
than
either
o
us
expected
dick
said
the
boy
grasping
his
friend
hand
warmly
ye
true
as
heart
of
oak
it
good
of
that
a
fact
not
a
bit
boy
it
costs
me
nothin
to
give
away
an
old
gun
that
no
use
for
an
worth
little
but
it
makes
me
right
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
do
it
marston
had
longed
for
a
rifle
ever
since
he
could
walk
but
his
prospects
of
obtaining
one
were
very
poor
indeed
at
that
time
and
it
is
a
question
whether
he
did
not
at
that
moment
experience
as
much
joy
in
handling
the
old
piece
as
his
friend
felt
in
shouldering
the
prize
a
difficulty
now
occurred
which
had
not
before
been
thought
of
this
was
no
less
than
the
absolute
refusal
of
dick
varley
canine
property
to
follow
him
fan
had
no
idea
of
changing
masters
without
her
consent
being
asked
or
her
inclination
being
consulted
you
have
to
tie
her
up
for
a
while
i
fear
said
the
major
no
fear
answered
the
youth
dog
natur
like
human
natur
saying
this
he
seized
crusoe
by
the
neck
stuffed
him
comfortably
into
the
bosom
of
his
and
walked
rapidly
away
with
the
prize
rifle
on
his
shoulder
fan
had
not
bargained
for
this
she
stood
irresolute
gazing
now
to
the
right
and
now
to
the
left
as
the
major
retired
in
one
direction
and
dick
with
crusoe
in
another
suddenly
crusoe
who
although
comfortable
in
body
was
ill
at
ease
in
spirit
gave
utterance
to
a
melancholy
howl
the
mother
love
instantly
prevailed
for
one
moment
she
pricked
up
her
ears
at
the
sound
and
then
lowering
them
trotted
quietly
after
her
new
master
and
followed
him
to
his
cottage
on
the
margin
of
the
lake

it
is
pleasant
to
look
upon
a
serene
quiet
humble
face
on
such
a
face
did
richard
varley
look
every
night
when
he
entered

cottage
varley
was
a

had
followed
the
fortunes
of

the

and
enter
upon
the
wild
life
of
a
backwoods
settlement
dick
mother
was
thin
and
old
and
wrinkled
but
her
face
was
stamped
with
a
species
of
beauty
which
fades
the
beauty
of
a
loving
look
ah
the
brow
of
snow
and
the
cheek
may
snare
the
heart
of
man
for
a
time

the
alone
can
forge

chain
that

shall
never
break
mistake
us
not
reader
and
bear
with
us
if
we
attempt
to
analyze
this
look
which
characterized
varley
a
rare
diamond
is
worth
stopping
to
glance
at
even
when
one
is
in
a
hurry
the
brightest
jewel
in
the
human
heart
is
worth
a
thought
or
two
by
we
do
not
mean
a
look
of
love
bestowed
on
a
beloved
object
is
common
enough
and
thankful
should
we
be
that
it
is
so
common
in
a
world
that
overfull
of
hatred
still
less
do
we
mean
that
smile
and
look
of
intense
affection
with
which
some
people
good
people
too
greet
friend
and
foe
alike
and
by
which
effort
to
work
out
their
of
the
expression
of
christian
love
they
do
signally
damage
their
cause
by
saddening
the
serious
and
repelling
the
gay
much
less
do
we
mean
that
smile
of
which
argues
more
of
personal
comfort
and
than
anything
else
no
the
loving
look
we
speak
of
is
as
often
grave
as
gay
its
character
depends
very
much
on
the
face
through
which
it
beams
and
it
can
not
be
counterfeited
its
defies
imitation
like
the
clouded
sun
of
april
it
can
pierce
through
tears
of
sorrow
like
the
noontide
sun
of
summer
it
can
blaze
in
warm
smiles
like
the
northern
lights
of
winter
it
can
gleam
in
depths
of
woe
but
it
is
always
the
same
modified
doubtless
and
rendered
more
or
less
patent
to
others
according
to
the
natural
amiability
of
him
or
her
who
bestows
it
no
one
can
put
it
on
still
less
can
any
one
put
it
off
its
range
is
universal
it
embraces
all
mankind
though
it
is
intensified
on
a
few
favoured
objects
its
seat
is
in
the
depths
of
a
renewed
heart
and
its
foundation
lies
in
love
to
god
young
varley
mother
lived
in
a
cottage
which
was
of
the
smallest
possible
dimensions
consistent
with
comfort
it
was
made
of
logs
as
indeed
were
all
the
other
cottages
in
the
valley
the
door
was
in
the
centre
and
a
passage
from
it
to
the
back
of
the
dwelling
divided
it
into
two
rooms
one
of
these
was
by
a
thin
partition
the
inner
room
being
varley
bedroom
the
outer
dick
daniel
hood
dormitory
was
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
which
apartment
served
also
as
a
parlour
the
rooms
were
lighted
by
two
windows
one
on
each
side
of
the
door
which
gave
to
the
house
the
appearance
of
having
a
nose
and
two
eyes
houses
of
this
kind
have
literally
got
a
sort
of
on
if
we
may
use
the
word
their
countenances
windows
give
the
appearance
of
placidity
ones
that
of
surprise
varley
was
a
surprise
cottage
and
this
was
in
keeping
with
the
scene
in
which
it
stood
for
the
clear
lake
in
front
studded
with
islands
and
the
distant
hills
beyond
composed
a
scene
so
surprisingly
beautiful
that
it
never
failed
to
call
forth
an
expression
of
astonished
admiration
from
every
new
visitor
to
the
mustang
valley
my
boy
exclaimed
varley
as
her
son
entered
the
cottage
with
a
bound
why

hurried

varley
heart
beat
high
and
her
face
flushed
with
pride
as
she
gazed
at
her
son
who
laid
the
rifle
on
the
table
for
her
inspection
while
he
rattled
off
an
animated
and
somewhat
disjointed
account
of
the
match
deary
me
now
that
was
good
that
was
cliver
but
what
that
scraping
at
the
door
oh

he
cried
rising
and
opening

uncomfortable

my
son

and

and
he
plucked
crusoe
from
his
bosom
crusoe
having
found
his
position
to
be
one
of
great
comfort
had
fallen
into
a
profound
slumber
and
on
being
thus
unceremoniously
awakened
he
gave
forth
a
yelp
of
discontent
that
brought
fan
in
a
state
of
frantic
sympathy
to
his
side
there
you
are
fan
take
it
to
a
corner
and
make

said
varley
who
now
proceeded
to
spread
the
youth
meal
before
him
did
ye
drive
the
nail
three
times
no
only
once
and
that
not
parfetly
brought
all
down
at
one
shot
rifle
fan
an
pup
well
well
now
that
was
cliver
but
here
the
old
woman
paused
and
looked
grave
but
what
mother

wantin
to
go
off
to
the
mountains
now
i
fear

exclaimed
the

mother

i

and
he
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
so
forcibly
that
the
platters
rung
again
you
a
good
boy
dick
but
you
too
young

but
i
was
born
to
be
a
hunter
and
everybody
in
them
parts
is
a
hunter
and
i
ca
hunt
in
the
kitchen
you
know
mother
at
this
point
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
sound
that
caused
young
varley
to
spring
up
and
seize
his
rifle
and
fan
to
show
her
teeth
and
growl
hist
mother
that
like
horses
hoofs
he
whispered
opening
the
door
and
gazing
intently
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
came
louder
and
louder
it
came
until
an
opening
in
the
forest
showed
the
advancing
cavalcade
to
be
a
party
of
white
men
in
another
moment
they
were
in
full
view
a
band
of
about
thirty
horsemen
clad
in
the
leathern
costume
and
armed
with
the
long
rifle
of
the
far
west
some
wore
portions
of
the
gaudy
indian
dress
which
gave
to
them
a
brilliant
dashing
look
they
came
on
straight
for
the
and
saluted
the
varleys
with
a
jovial
cheer
as
they
swept
past
at
full
speed
dick
returned
the
cheer
with
compound
interest
and
calling
out
they
trappers
mother
i
be
back
in
an
hour
bounded
off
like
a
deer
through
the
woods
taking
a
short
cut
in
order
to
reach
the
before
them
he
succeeded
for
just
as
he
arrived
at
the
house
the
cavalcade
wheeled
round
the
bend
in
the
river
dashed
up
the
slope
and
came
to
a
sudden
halt
on
the
green
vaulting
from
their
foaming
steeds
they
tied
them
to
the
stockades
of
the
little
fortress
which
they
entered
in
a
body
hot
haste
was
in
every
motion
of
these
men
they
were
trappers
they
said
on
their
way
to
the
rocky
mountains
to
hunt
and
trade
furs
but
one
of
their
number
had
been
treacherously
murdered
and
scalped
by
a
pawnee
chief
and
they
resolved
to
revenge
his
death
by
an
attack
on
one
of
the
pawnee
villages
they
would
teach
these
red
reptiles
to
respect
white
men
they
would
come
of
it
what
might
and
they
had
turned
aside
here
to
procure
an
additional
supply
of
powder
and
lead
in
vain
did
the
major
endeavour
to
dissuade
these
reckless
men
from
their
purpose
they
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
returning
good
for
evil
and
insisted
on
being
supplied
the
log
hut
was
a
store
as
well
as
a
place
of
defence
and
as
they
offered
to
pay
for
it
there
was
no
refusing
their
request
at
least
so
the
major
thought
the
ammunition
was
therefore
given
to
them
and
in
they
were
away
again
at
full
gallop
over
the
plains
on
their
mission
of
vengeance
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
but
these
men
knew
not
what
god
said
because
they
never
read
his
word
and
did
not
own
his
sway
young
varley
enthusiasm
was
considerably
damped
when
he
learned
the
errand
on
which
the
trappers
were
bent
from
that
time
forward
he
gave
up
all
desire
to
visit
the
mountains
in
company
with
such
men
but
he
still
retained
an
intense
longing
to
roam
at
large
among
their
rocky
fastnesses
and
gallop
out
upon
the
wide
prairies
meanwhile
he
dutifully
tended
his
mother
cattle
and
sheep
and
contented
himself
with
an
occasional
in
the
neighbouring
forests
he
devoted
himself
also
to
the
training
of
his
dog
crusoe
an
operation
which
at
first
cost
him
many
a
deep
sigh
every
one
has
heard
of
the
sagacity
and
almost
reasoning
capabilities
of
the
newfoundland
dog
indeed
some
have
even
gone
the
length
of
saying
that
what
is
called
instinct
in
these
animals
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
reason
and
in
truth
many
of
the
noble
heroic
and
sagacious
deeds
that
have
actually
been
performed
by
newfoundland
dogs
incline
us
almost
to
believe
that
like
man
they
are
gifted
with
reasoning
powers
but
every
one
does
not
know
the
trouble
and
patience
that
is
required
in
order
to
get
a
juvenile
dog
to
understand
what
its
master
means
when
he
is
endeavouring
to
instruct
it
crusoe
first
lesson
was
an
interesting
but
not
a
very
successful
one
we
may
remark
here
that
dick
varley
had
presented
fan
to
his
mother
to
be
her
resolving
to
devote
all
his
powers
to
the
training
of
the
pup
we
may
also
remark
in
reference
to
appearance
and
we
did
not
remark
it
sooner
chiefly
because
up
to
this
period
in
his
eventful
history
he
was
little
better
than
a
ball
of
fat
and
hair
that
his
coat
was
mingled
and
pure
white
and
remarkably
glossy
curly
and
thick
a
week
after
the
crusoe
education
began
having
fed
him
for
that
period
with
his
own
hand
in
order
to
gain
his
affection
dick
took
him
out
one
sunny
forenoon
to
the
margin
of
the
lake
to
give
him
his
first
lesson
and
here
again
we
must
pause
to
remark
that
although
a
dog
heart
is
generally
gained
in
the
first
instance
through
his
mouth
yet
after
it
is
thoroughly
gained
his
affection
is
noble
and
disinterested
he
can
scarcely
be
driven
from
his
master
side
by
blows
and
even
when
thus
harshly
repelled
is
always
ready
on
the
shortest
notice
and
with
the
slightest
encouragement
to
make
it
up
again
well
dick
varley
began
by
calling
out
crusoe
crusoe
come
here
pup
of
course
crusoe
knew
his
name
by
this
time
for
it
had
been
so
often
used
as
a
prelude
to
his
meals
that
he
naturally
expected
a
feed
whenever
he
heard
it
this
portal
to
his
brain
had
already
been
open
for
some
days
but
all
the
other
doors
were
fast
locked
and
it
required
a
great
deal
of
careful
picking
to
open
them
now
crusoe
come
here
crusoe
bounded
clumsily
to
his
master
side
cocked
his
ears
and
wagged
his
tail
so
far
his
education
was
perfect
we
say
he
bounded
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
still
a
very
young
pup
with
soft
flabby
muscles
now
i
goin
to
begin
yer
edication
pup
think
o
that
whether
crusoe
thought
of
that
or
not
we
can
not
say
but
he
looked
up
in
his
master
face
as
he
spoke
cocked
his
ears
very
high
and
turned
his
head
slowly
to
one
side
until
it
could
not
turn
any
farther
in
that
direction
then
he
turned
it
as
much
to
the
other
side
whereat
his
master
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
and
crusoe
immediately
began
barking
vociferously
come
come
said
dick
suddenly
checking
his
mirth
we
play
pup
we
must
work
drawing
a
leathern
mitten
from
his
belt
the
youth
held
it
to
nose
and
then
threw
it
a
yard
away
at
the
same
time
exclaiming
in
a
loud
distinct
tone
fetch
it
crusoe
entered
at
once
into
the
spirit
of
this
part
of
his
training
he
dashed
gleefully
at
the
mitten
and
proceeded
to
worry
it
with
intense
gratification
as
for
fetch
it
he
neither
understood
the
words
nor
cared
a
straw
about
them
dick
varley
rose
immediately
and
rescuing
the
mitten
resumed
his
seat
on
a
rock
come
here
crusoe
he
repeated
oh
certainly
by
all
means
said
crusoe
no
he
did
exactly
it
but
really
he
these
words
so
evidently
that
we
think
it
right
to
let
them
stand
as
they
are
written
if
he
could
have
finished
the
sentence
he
would
certainly
have
said
go
on
with
that
game
over
again
old
boy
it
quite
to
my
taste
the
jolliest
thing
in
life
i
assure
you
at
least
if
we
may
not
positively
assert
that
he
would
have
said
that
no
one
else
can
absolutely
affirm
that
he
would
well
dick
varley
did
do
it
over
again
and
crusoe
worried
the
mitten
over
again
utterly
regardless
of
fetch
it
then
they
did
it
again
and
again
and
again
but
without
the
slightest
apparent
advancement
in
the
path
of
canine
knowledge
and
then
they
went
home
during
all
this
trying
operation
dick
varley
never
once
betrayed
the
slightest
feeling
of
irritability
or
impatience
he
did
not
expect
success
at
first
he
was
not
therefore
disappointed
at
failure
next
day
he
had
him
out
again
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
again
with
the
like
unfavourable
result
in
short
it
seemed
at
last
as
if
crusoe
mind
had
been
deeply
imbued
with
the
idea
that
he
had
been
born
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
worrying
that
mitten
and
he
meant
to
fulfil
his
destiny
to
the
letter
young
varley
had
taken
several
small
pieces
of
meat
in
his
pocket
each
day
with
the
intention
of
rewarding
crusoe
when
he
should
at
length
be
prevailed
on
to
fetch
the
mitten
but
as
crusoe
was
not
aware
of
the
treat
that
awaited
him
of
course
the
mitten
never
was
fetched
at
last
dick
varley
saw
that
this
system
would
never
do
so
he
changed
his
tactics
and
the
next
morning
gave
crusoe
no
breakfast
but
took
him
out
at
the
usual
hour
to
go
through
his
lesson
this
new
course
of
conduct
seemed
to
perplex
crusoe
not
a
little
for
on
his
way
down
to
the
beach
he
paused
frequently
and
looked
back
at
the
cottage
and
then
expressively
up
at
his
master
face
but
the
master
was
inexorable
he
went
on
and
crusoe
followed
for
love
had
now
taken
possession
of
the
pup
young
heart
and
he
preferred
his
master
company
to
food
varley
now
began
by
letting
the
learner
smell
a
piece
of
meat
which
he
eagerly
sought
to
devour
but
was
prevented
to
his
immense
disgust
then
the
mitten
was
thrown
as
heretofore
and
crusoe
made
a
few
steps
towards
it
but
being
in
no
mood
for
play
he
turned
back
fetch
it
said
the
teacher
i
wo
replied
the
learner
mutely
by
means
of
that
expressive
sign
doing
hereupon
dick
varley
rose
took
up
the
mitten
and
put
it
into
the
pup
mouth
then
retiring
a
couple
of
yards
he
held
out
the
piece
of
meat
and
said
fetch
it
crusoe
instantly
spat
out
the
glove
and
bounded
towards
the
meat
once
more
to
be
disappointed
this
was
done
a
second
time
and
crusoe
came
forward
the
mitten
in
his
it
seemed
as
if
it
had
been
done
accidentally
for
he
dropped
it
before
coming
quite
up
if
so
it
was
a
fortunate
accident
for
it
served
as
the
tiny
fulcrum
on
which
to
place
the
point
of
that
mighty
lever
which
was
destined
ere
long
to
raise
him
to
the
pinnacle
of
canine
erudition
dick
varley
immediately
lavished
upon
him
the
tenderest
caresses
and
gave
him
a
lump
of
meat
but
he
quickly
tried
it
again
lest
he
should
lose
the
lesson
the
dog
evidently
felt
that
if
he
did
not
fetch
that
mitten
he
should
have
no
meat
or
caresses
in
order
however
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
mistake
dick
laid
the
mitten
down
beside
the
pup
instead
of
putting
it
into
his
mouth
and
retiring
a
few
paces
cried
fetch
it
crusoe
looked
uncertain
for
a
moment
then
he
picked
up
the
mitten
and
laid
it
at
his
master
feet
the
lesson
was
learned
at
last
dick
varley
tumbled
all
the
meat
out
of
his
pocket
on
the
ground
and
while
crusoe
made
a
hearty
breakfast
he
sat
down
on
a
rock
and
whistled
with
glee
at
having
fairly
picked
the
lock
and
opened
door
into
one
of
the
many
chambers
of
his
dog
intellect
chapter
iv
hero
enlarged
upon
two
years
passed
away
the
mustang
valley
settlement
advanced
prosperously
despite
one
or
two
attacks
made
upon
it
by
the
savages
who
were
however
firmly
repelled
dick
varley
had
now
become
a
man
and
his
pup
crusoe
had
become
a
dog
the
silver
rifle
as
dick
weapon
had
come
to
be
named
was
well
known
among
the
hunters
and
the
redskins
of
the
and
in
dick
hands
its
bullets
were
as
deadly
as
its
owner
eye
was
quick
and
true
crusoe
education
too
had
been
completed
faithfully
and
patiently
had
his
young
master
trained
his
mind
until
he
fitted
him
to
be
a
meet
companion
in
the
hunt
to
carry
and
fetch
were
now
but
trifling
portions
of
the
dog
accomplishments
he
could
dive
a
fathom
deep
in
the
lake
and
bring
up
any
article
that
might
have
been
dropped
or
thrown
in
his
swimming
powers
were
marvellous
and
so
powerful
were
his
muscles
that
he
seemed
to
spurn
the
water
while
passing
through
it
with
his
broad
chest
high
out
of
the
curling
wave
at
a
speed
that
neither
man
nor
beast
could
keep
up
with
for
a
moment
his
intellect
now
was
sharp
and
quick
as
a
needle
he
never
required
a
second
bidding
when
dick
went
out
hunting
he
used
frequently
to
drop
a
mitten
or
a
unknown
to
the
dog
and
after
walking
miles
away
from
it
would
stop
short
and
look
down
into
the
mild
gentle
face
of
his
companion
crusoe
he
said
in
the
same
quiet
tones
with
which
he
would
have
addressed
a
human
friend
i
dropped
my
mitten
go
fetch
it
pup
dick
continued
to
call
it
pup
from
habit
one
glance
of
intelligence
passed
from
crusoe
eye
and
in
a
moment
he
was
away
at
full
gallop
nor
did
he
rest
until
the
lost
article
was
lying
at
his
master
feet
dick
was
loath
to
try
how
far
back
on
his
track
crusoe
would
run
if
desired
he
had
often
gone
back
five
and
six
miles
at
a
stretch
but
his
powers
did
not
stop
here
he
could
carry
articles
back
to
the
spot
from
which
they
had
been
taken
and
leave
them
there
he
could
head
the
game
that
his
master
was
pursuing
and
turn
it
back
and
he
would
guard
any
object
he
was
desired
to
watch
with
unflinching
constancy
but
it
would
occupy
too
much
space
and
time
to
enumerate
all
crusoe
qualities
and
powers
his
biography
will
unfold
them
in
personal
appearance
he
was
majestic
having
grown
to
an
immense
size
even
for
a
newfoundland
had
his
visage
been
at
all
wolfish
in
character
his
aspect
would
have
been
terrible
but
he
possessed
in
an
eminent
degree
that
mild
humble
expression
of
face
peculiar
to
his
race
when
roused
or
excited
and
especially
when
bounding
through
the
forest
with
the
chase
in
view
he
was
absolutely
magnificent
at
other
times
his
gait
was
slow
and
he
seemed
to
prefer
a
quiet
walk
with
dick
varley
to
anything
else
under
the
sun
but
when
dick
was
inclined
to
be
boisterous
crusoe
tail
and
ears
rose
at
a
moment
notice
and
he
was
ready
for
anything
moreover
he
obeyed
commands
instantly
and
implicitly
in
this
respect
he
put
to
shame
most
of
the
boys
of
the
settlement
who
were
by
no
means
famed
for
their
habits
of
prompt
obedience
crusoe
eye
was
constantly
watching
the
face
of
his
master
when
dick
said
go
he
went
when
he
said
come
he
came
if
he
had
been
in
the
midst
of
an
excited
bound
at
the
throat
of
a
stag
and
dick
had
called
out
down
crusoe
he
would
have
sunk
to
the
earth
like
a
stone
no
doubt
it
took
many
months
of
training
to
bring
the
dog
to
this
state
of
perfection
but
dick
accomplished
it
by
patience
perseverance
and
besides
all
this
crusoe
could
speak
he
spoke
by
means
of
the
dumb
alphabet
in
a
way
that
defies
description
he
conversed
so
to
speak
with
his
extremities
his
head
and
his
tail
but
his
eyes
his
soft
brown
eyes
were
the
chief
medium
of
communication
if
ever
the
language
of
the
eyes
was
carried
to
perfection
it
was
exhibited
in
the
person
of
crusoe
but
indeed
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
part
of
his
expressive
face
expressed
most
the
cocked
ears
of
expectation
the
drooped
ears
of
sorrow
the
bright
full
eye
of
joy
the
eye
of
contentment
and
the
frowning
eye
of
indignation
accompanied
with
a
slight
a
very
slight
pucker
of
the
nose
and
a
gleam
of
dazzling
ivory
ha
no
enemy
ever
saw
this
last
piece
of
canine
language
without
a
full
appreciation
of
what
it
meant
then
as
to
the
tail
the
modulations
of
meaning
in
the
varied
wag
of
that
expressive
member
oh
it
useless
to
attempt
description
mortal
man
can
not
conceive
of
the
delicate
shades
of
sentiment
expressible
by
a
dog
tail
unless
he
has
studied
the
subject
the
wag
the
waggle
the
cock
the
droop
the
slope
the
wriggle
away
with
description
it
is
impotent
and
valueless
here
as
we
have
said
crusoe
was
meek
and
mild
he
had
been
bitten
on
the
sly
by
half
the
curs
in
the
settlement
and
had
only
shown
his
teeth
in
return
he
had
no
enmities
though
several
enemies
and
he
had
a
thousand
friends
particularly
among
the
ranks
of
the
weak
and
the
persecuted
whom
he
always
protected
and
avenged
when
opportunity
offered
a
single
instance
of
this
kind
will
serve
to
show
his
character
one
day
dick
and
crusoe
were
sitting
on
a
rock
beside
the
lake
the
same
identical
rock
near
which
when
a
pup
the
latter
had
received
his
first
lesson
they
were
conversing
as
usual
for
dick
had
elicited
such
a
fund
of
intelligence
from
the
dog
mind
and
had
injected
such
wealth
of
wisdom
into
it
that
he
felt
convinced
it
understood
every
word
he
said
this
is
capital
weather
crusoe
ai
it
pup
crusoe
made
a
motion
with
his
head
which
was
quite
as
significant
as
a
nod
ha
my
pup
i
wish
that
you
and
i
might
go
and
have
a
slap
at
the
grizzly
bars
and
a
look
at
the
rocky
mountains
would
it
be
nuts
pup
crusoe
looked
dubious
what
you
do
agree
with
me
now
tell
me
pup
would
ye
like
to
grip
a
bar
still
crusoe
looked
dubious
but
made
a
gentle
motion
with
his
tail
as
though
he
would
have
said
i
seen
neither
rocky
mountains
nor
grizzly
bars
and
know
nothin
about
but
i
open
to
conviction
you
a
brave
pup
rejoined
dick
stroking
the
dog
huge
head
affectionately
i
would
give
you
for
ten
times
your
weight
in
golden
dollars
if
there
be
sich
things
crusoe
made
no
reply
whatever
to
this
he
regarded
it
as
a
truism
unworthy
of
notice
he
evidently
felt
that
a
comparison
between
love
and
dollars
was
preposterous
at
this
point
in
the
conversation
a
little
dog
with
a
lame
leg
hobbled
to
the
edge
of
the
rocks
in
front
of
the
spot
where
dick
was
seated
and
looked
down
into
the
water
which
was
deep
there
whether
it
did
so
for
the
purpose
of
admiring
its
very
plain
visage
in
the
liquid
mirror
or
finding
out
what
was
going
on
among
the
fish
we
can
not
say
as
it
never
told
us
but
at
that
moment
a
big
clumsy
dog
rushed
out
from
the
neighbouring
thicket
and
began
to
worry
it
punish
him
crusoe
said
dick
quickly
crusoe
made
one
bound
that
a
lion
might
have
been
proud
of
and
seizing
the
aggressor
by
the
back
lifted
him
off
his
legs
and
held
him
howling
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
casting
a
look
towards
his
master
for
further
instructions
pitch
him
in
said
dick
making
a
sign
with
his
hand
crusoe
turned
and
quietly
dropped
the
dog
into
the
lake
having
regarded
his
struggles
there
for
a
few
moments
with
grave
severity
of
countenance
he
walked
slowly
back
and
sat
down
beside
his
master
the
little
dog
made
good
its
retreat
as
fast
as
three
legs
would
carry
it
and
the
surly
dog
having
swum
ashore
retired
sulkily
with
his
tail
very
much
between
his
legs
little
wonder
then
that
crusoe
was
beloved
by
great
and
small
among
the
of
the
canine
tribe
of
the
mustang
valley
but
crusoe
was
not
a
mere
machine
when
not
actively
engaged
in
dick
varley
service
he
busied
himself
with
private
little
matters
of
his
own
he
undertook
modest
little
excursions
into
the
woods
or
along
the
margin
of
the
lake
sometimes
alone
but
more
frequently
with
a
little
friend
whose
whole
heart
and
being
seemed
to
be
swallowed
up
in
admiration
of
his
big
companion
whether
crusoe
botanized
or
geologized
on
these
excursions
we
will
not
venture
to
say
assuredly
he
seemed
as
though
he
did
both
for
he
poked
his
nose
into
every
bush
and
tuft
of
moss
and
turned
over
the
stones
and
dug
holes
in
the
ground
and
in
short
if
he
did
not
understand
these
sciences
he
behaved
very
much
as
if
he
did
certainly
he
knew
as
much
about
them
as
many
of
the
human
species
do
in
these
walks
he
never
took
the
slightest
notice
of
grumps
that
was
the
little
dog
name
but
grumps
made
up
for
this
by
taking
excessive
notice
of
him
when
crusoe
stopped
grumps
stopped
and
sat
down
to
look
at
him
when
crusoe
trotted
on
grumps
trotted
on
too
when
crusoe
examined
a
bush
grumps
sat
down
to
watch
him
and
when
he
dug
a
hole
grumps
looked
into
it
to
see
what
was
there
grumps
never
helped
him
his
sole
delight
was
in
looking
on
they
did
converse
much
these
two
dogs
to
be
in
each
other
company
seemed
to
be
happiness
enough
at
least
grumps
thought
so
there
was
one
point
at
which
grumps
stopped
short
however
and
ceased
to
follow
his
friend
and
that
was
when
he
rushed
headlong
into
the
lake
and
disported
himself
for
an
hour
at
a
time
in
its
cool
waters
crusoe
was
both
by
nature
and
training
a
splendid
grumps
on
the
contrary
held
water
in
abhorrence
so
he
sat
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
disconsolate
when
his
friend
was
bathing
and
waited
till
he
came
out
the
only
time
when
grumps
was
thoroughly
nonplussed
was
when
dick
varley
whistle
sounded
faintly
in
the
far
distance
then
crusoe
would
prick
up
his
ears
and
stretch
out
at
full
gallop
clearing
ditch
and
fence
and
brake
with
his
strong
elastic
bound
and
leaving
grumps
to
patter
after
him
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
poor
grumps
usually
arrived
at
the
village
to
find
both
dog
and
master
gone
and
would
betake
himself
to
his
own
dwelling
there
to
lie
down
and
sleep
and
dream
perchance
of
rambles
and
gambols
with
his
gigantic
friend
chapter
mission
of
peace
unexpected
joys
dick
and
crusoe
set
off
for
the
land
of
the
redskins
and
meet
with
adventures
by
the
way
as
a
matter
of
course
night
in
the
wild
one
day
the
inhabitants
of
mustang
valley
were
thrown
into
considerable
excitement
by
the
arrival
of
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
and
a
small
escort
of
cavalry
they
went
direct
to
the
blockhouse
which
since
major
hope
departure
had
become
the
residence
of
joe
blunt
that
worthy
having
by
general
consent
been
deemed
the
fittest
man
in
the
settlement
to
fill
the
major
place
soon
it
began
to
be
noised
abroad
that
the
strangers
had
been
sent
by
government
to
endeavour
to
bring
about
if
possible
a
more
friendly
state
of
feeling
between
the
whites
and
the
indians
by
means
of
presents
and
promises
and
fair
speeches
the
party
remained
all
night
in
the
and
ere
long
it
was
reported
that
joe
blunt
had
been
requested
and
had
consented
to
be
the
leader
and
chief
of
a
party
of
three
men
who
should
visit
the
neighbouring
tribes
of
indians
to
the
west
and
north
of
the
valley
as
government
agents
joe
knowledge
of
two
or
three
different
indian
dialects
and
his
sagacity
rendered
him
a
most
fitting
messenger
on
such
an
errand
it
was
also
whispered
that
joe
was
to
have
the
choosing
of
his
comrades
in
this
mission
and
many
were
the
opinions
expressed
and
guesses
made
as
to
who
would
be
chosen
that
same
evening
dick
varley
was
sitting
in
his
mother
kitchen
cleaning
his
rifle
his
mother
was
preparing
supper
and
talking
quietly
about
the
obstinacy
of
a
particular
hen
that
had
taken
to
laying
her
eggs
in
places
where
they
could
not
be
found
fan
was
coiled
up
in
a
corner

asleep
and
crusoe
was
sitting
at
one
side
of
the
fire
looking
on
at
things

at
that
moment
and
stepped
into
the
room

said
the
stout
hunter
doffing
his
cap
and
resting
his
rifle
in
a
corner

a
chair
for
him

dick
grasped
his
mother
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
cheek
in
silence
at
the
same
moment
crusoe
seeing
that
the
deeper
feelings
of
his
master
were
touched
and
deeming
it
his
duty
to

murmured
the
widow
in
a
dick
varley
spent
that
night
in
converse
with
his
mother
and
next
morning
at
daybreak
he
was
at
the
place
of
meeting
mounted
on
his
sturdy
little
horse
with
the
silver
rifle
on
his
shoulder
and
crusoe
by
his
side
that
right
lad

right
nothin

said
joe
as
he
led
out
a
from
the
gate
of
the
while
his
own
charger
was
held
ready
saddled
by
a
man
named
daniel
brand
who
had
been
appointed
to
the
charge
of
the
in
his
absence
where
henri
oh
here
he
comes
exclaimed
dick
as
the
hunter
referred
to
came
thundering
up
the
slope
at
a
charge
on
a
horse
that
resembled
its
rider
in
size
and
not
a
little
in
clumsiness
of
appearance
ah
mes
boy
him
is
a
goot
one

cried
henri
remarking
dick
smile
as
he
pulled
up
no
hoss
on
de
plain
can
beat
dis
one
surement
now
then
henri
lend
a
hand
to
fix
this
pack
we
no
time
to
palaver
by
this
time
they
were
joined
by
several
of
the
soldiers
and
a
few
hunters
who
had
come
to
see
them
start
remember
joe
said
one
if
you
do
come
back
in
three
months
we
all
come
out
in
a
band
to
seek
you
if
we
do
come
back
in
less
than
that
time

worth
seekin
for
said
joe
tightening
the
girth
of
his
saddle
put
a
bit
in
yer
own
mouth
henri
cried
another
as
the
canadian
arranged
his
steed
bridle
yell

it
more
than
yer
horse
when
ye
git
the
red
reptiles
vraiment
if
mon
mout
needs
one
bit
yours
will
need
one
padlock
now
lads
mount
cried
joe
blunt
as
he
vaulted
into
the
saddle
dick
varley
sprang
lightly
on
his
horse
and
henri
made
a
rush
at
his
steed
and
hurled
his
huge
frame
across
its
back
with
a
violence
that
ought
to
have
brought
it
to
the
ground
but
the
tall
roan
was
accustomed
to
the
eccentricities
of
its
master
and
stood
the
shock
bravely
being
appointed
to
lead
the
henri
seized
its
halter
then
the
three
cavaliers
shook
their
reins
and
waving
their
hands
to
their
comrades
they
sprang
into
the
woods
at
full
gallop
and
laid
their
course
for
the
far
west
for
some
time
they
galloped
side
by
side
in
silence
each
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
crusoe
keeping
close
beside
his
master
horse
the
two
elder
hunters
evidently
ruminated
on
the
object
of
their
mission
and
the
prospects
of
success
for
their
countenances
were
grave
and
their
eyes
cast
on
the
ground
dick
varley
too
thought
upon
the
but
his
musings
were
deeply
tinged
with
the
bright
hues
of
a
adventure
the
mountains
the
plains
the
indians
the
bears
the
buffaloes
and
a
thousand
other
objects
danced
wildly
before
his
mind
eye
and
his
blood
careered
through
his
veins
and
flushed
his
forehead
as
he
thought
of
what
he
should
see
and
do
and
felt
the
elastic
vigour
of
youth
respond
in
sympathy
to
the
light
spring
of
his
active
little
steed
he
was
a
lover
of
nature
too
and
his
flashing
eyes
glanced
observantly
from
side
to
side
as
they
swept
along
sometimes
through
glades
of
forest
trees
sometimes
through
belts
of
more
open
ground
and
shrubbery
anon
by
the
margin
of
a
stream
or
along
the
shores
of
a
little
lake
and
often
over
short
stretches
of
flowering
while
the
firm
elastic
turf
sent
up
a
muffled
sound
from
the
tramp
of
their
mettlesome
chargers
it
was
a
scene
of
wild
luxuriant
beauty
that
might
almost
one
could
fancy
have
drawn
involuntary
homage
to
its
bountiful
creator
from
the
lips
even
of
an
infidel
after
a
time
joe
blunt
reined
up
and
they
proceeded
at
an
easy
ambling
pace
joe
and
his
friend
henri
were
so
used
to
these
beautiful
scenes
that
they
had
long
ceased
to
be
enthusiastically
affected
by
them
though
they
never
ceased
to
delight
in
them
i
hope
said
joe
that
them
sodgers
go
their
ways
soon
i
no
notion
o
them
chaps
when
they
left
at
a
place
wi
nothin
to
do
but
whittle
sticks
why
joe
exclaimed
dick
varley
in
a
tone
of
surprise
i
thought
you
were
admirin
the
beautiful
face
o
nature
all
this
time
and
ye
only
thinkin
about
the
sodgers
now
that
strange
not
so
strange
after
all
lad
answered
joe
when
a
man
used
to
a
thing
he
gits
to
admire
an
enjoy
it
without
speakin
much
about
it
but
it
true
boy
that
mankind
gits
in
coorse
o
time
to
think
little
o
the
blissin
he
used
to
oui
murmured
henri
emphatically
well
joe
blunt
it
may
be
so
but
i
thankful
not
used
to
this
sort
o
thing
yet
exclaimed
varley
let
have
another
gallop
so
ho
come
along
crusoe
shouted
the
youth
as
he
shook
his
reins
and
flew
over
a
long
stretch
of
prairie
on
which
at
that
moment
they
entered
joe
smiled
as
he
followed
his
enthusiastic
companion
but
after
a
short
run
he
pulled
up
hold
on
youngster
he
cried
ye
must
larn
to
do
as
ye
bid
lad
it
trouble
enough
to
be
among
wild
injuns
and
wild
buffaloes
as
i
hope
soon
to
be
without
havin
wild
comrades
to
look
after
dick
laughed
and
reined
in
his
panting
horse
i
be
as
obedient
as
crusoe
he
said
and
no
one
can
beat
him
besides
continued
joe
the
horses
wo
travel
far
if
we
begin
by
runnin
all
the
wind
out
o
them
wah
exclaimed
henri
as
the
led
horse
became
restive
i
think
we
must
give
to
him
de
for
to
lead
eh
not
a
bad
notion
henri
we
make
that
the
penalty
of
runnin
off
again
so
look
out
master
dick
i
down
replied
dick
with
a
modest
air
obedient
as
a
baby
and
wo
run
off
again
till
the
next
time
by
the
way
joe
how
many
days
provisions
did
ye
bring
two
that
to
carry
us
to
the
great
prairie
which
is
three
weeks
distant
from
this
our
own
good
rifles
must
make
up
the
difference
and
keep
us
when
we
get
there
and
we
neither
find
deer
nor
buffalo
suggested
dick
i
we
have
to
starve
dat
is
to
tink
upon
remarked
henri
more
comfortable
to
think
o
than
to
undergo
said
dick
but
i
there
little
chance
o
that
well
not
much
replied
joe
blunt
patting
his
horse
neck
but
d
see
lad
ye
niver
can
count
for
sartin
on
anythin
the
deer
and
buffalo
ought
to
be
thick
in
them
plains
at
this
time
and
when
the
buffalo
thick
they
covers
the
plains
till
ye
can
hardly
see
the
end
o
them
but
ye
see
sometimes
the
rascally
redskins
takes
it
into
their
heads
to
burn
the
prairies
and
sometimes
ye
find
the
place
that
should
ha
bin
black
wi
buffalo
black
as
a
coal
wi
fire
for
miles
an
miles
on
end
at
other
times
the
redskins
go
huntin
in
places
and
sweeps
them
clean
o
every
hoof
that
do
git
away
sometimes
too
the
animals
seems
to
take
a
scunner
at
a
place
and
keeps
out
o
the
way
but
one
way
or
another
men
gin
rally
manage
to
scramble
through
look
yonder
joe
exclaimed
dick
pointing
to
the
summit
of
a
distant
ridge
where
a
small
black
object
was
seen
moving
against
the
sky
that
a
deer
ai
it
joe
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
gazed
earnestly
at
the
object
in
question
ye
right
boy
and
by
good
luck
we
got
the
wind
of
him
cut
in
an
take
your
chance
now
there
a
long
strip
o
wood
as
let
ye
git
close
to
him
before
the
sentence
was
well
finished
dick
and
crusoe
were
off
at
full
gallop
for
a
few
hundred
yards
they
coursed
along
the
bottom
of
a
hollow
then
turning
to
the
right
they
entered
the
strip
of
wood
and
in
a
few
minutes
gained
the
edge
of
it
here
dick
dismounted
you
ca
help
me
here
crusoe
stay
where
you
are
pup
and
hold
my
horse
crusoe
seized
the
end
of
the
line
which
was
fastened
to
the
nose
in
his
mouth
and
lay
down
on
a
hillock
of
moss
submissively
placing
his
chin
on
his
forepaws
and
watching
his
master
as
he
stepped
noiselessly
through
the
wood
in
a
few
minutes
dick
emerged
from
among
the
trees
and
creeping
from
bush
to
bush
succeeded
in
getting
to
within
six
hundred
yards
of
the
deer
which
was
a
beautiful
little
antelope
beyond
the
bush
behind
which
he
now
crouched
all
was
bare
open
ground
without
a
shrub
or
a
hillock
large
enough
to
conceal
the
hunter
there
was
a
slight
undulation
in
the
ground
however
which
enabled
him
to
advance
about
fifty
yards
farther
by
means
of
lying
down
quite
flat
and
working
himself
forward
like
a
serpent
farther
than
this
he
could
not
move
without
being
seen
by
the
antelope
which
browsed
on
the
ridge
before
him
in
fancied
security
the
distance
was
too
great
even
for
a
long
shot
but
dick
knew
of
a
weak
point
in
this
little
creature
nature
which
enabled
him
to
accomplish
his
purpose
a
weak
point
which
it
shares
in
common
with
animals
of
a
higher
order
namely
curiosity
the
little
antelope
of
the
north
american
prairies
is
intensely
curious
about
everything
that
it
does
not
quite
understand
and
will
not
rest
satisfied
until
it
has
endeavoured
to
clear
up
the
mystery
availing
himself
of
this
propensity
dick
did
what
both
indians
and
hunters
are
accustomed
to
do
on
these
occasions
he
put
a
piece
of
rag
on
the
end
of
his
ramrod
and
keeping
his
person
concealed
and
perfectly
still
waved
this
miniature
flag
in
the
air
the
antelope
noticed
it
at
once
and
pricking
up
its
ears
began
to
advance
timidly
and
slowly
step
by
step
to
see
what
remarkable
phenomenon
it
could
be
in
a
few
seconds
the
flag
was
lowered
a
sharp
crack
followed
and
the
antelope
fell
dead
upon
the
plain
ha
boy
that
a
good
supper
anyhow
cried
joe
as
he
galloped
up
and
dismounted
goot
dat
is
better
nor
dried
meat
added
henri
give
him
to
me
i
will
put
him
on
my
hoss
vich
is
strongar
dan
yourn
but
ver
is
your
hoss
he
be
here
in
a
minute
replied
dick
putting
his
fingers
to
his
mouth
and
giving
forth
a
shrill
whistle
the
instant
crusoe
heard
the
sound
he
made
a
savage
and
apparently
dash
at
the
horse
heels
this
wild
act
so
contrary
to
the
dog
gentle
nature
was
a
mere
piece
of
acting
he
knew
that
the
horse
would
not
advance
without
getting
a
fright
so
he
gave
him
one
in
this
way
which
sent
him
off
at
a
gallop
crusoe
followed
close
at
his
heels
so
as
to
bring
the
line
alongside
of
the
nag
body
and
thereby
prevent
its
getting
entangled
but
despite
his
best
efforts
the
horse
got
on
one
side
of
a
tree
and
he
on
the
other
so
he
wisely
let
go
his
hold
of
the
line
and
waited
till
more
open
ground
enabled
him
to
catch
it
again
then
he
hung
heavily
back
gradually
checked
the
horse
speed
and
finally
trotted
him
up
to
his
master
side
is
a
cliver
cur
good
sooth
exclaimed
joe
blunt
in
surprise
ah
joe
you
have
seen
much
of
crusoe
yet
he
as
good
as
a
man
any
day
i
done
little
else
but
train
him
for
two
years
gone
by
and
he
can
do
most
anything
but
shoot
he
ca
handle
the
rifle
nohow
ha
then
i
tink
perhaps
hims
could
if
he
wos
try
said
henri
plunging
on
to
his
horse
with
a
laugh
and
arranging
the
carcass
of
the
antelope
across
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
thus
they
hunted
and
galloped
and
trotted
and
ambled
on
through
wood
and
plain
all
day
until
the
sun
began
to
descend
below
the
of
the
bluffs
on
the
west
then
joe
blunt
looked
about
him
for
a
place
on
which
to
camp
and
finally
fixed
on
a
spot
under
the
shadow
of
a
noble
birch
by
the
margin
of
a
little
stream
the
carpet
of
grass
on
its
banks
was
soft
like
green
velvet
and
the
rippling
waters
of
the
brook
were
clear
as
crystal
very
different
from
the
muddy
missouri
into
which
it
flowed
while
dick
varley
felled
and
cut
up
firewood
henri
unpacked
the
horses
and
turned
them
loose
to
graze
and
joe
kindled
the
fire
and
prepared
venison
steaks
and
hot
tea
for
supper
in
excursions
of
this
kind
it
is
customary
to
hobble
the
horses
that
is
to
tie
their
together
so
that
they
can
not
run
either
fast
or
far
but
are
free
enough
to
amble
about
with
a
clumsy
sort
of
hop
in
search
of
food
this
is
deemed
a
sufficient
check
on
their
tendency
to
roam
although
some
of
the
knowing
horses
sometimes
learn
to
hop
so
fast
with
their
hobbles
as
to
give
their
owners
much
trouble
to
recapture
them
but
when
out
in
the
prairies
where
indians
are
known
or
supposed
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
the
horses
are
picketed
by
means
of
a
pin
or
stake
attached
to
the
ends
of
their
long
lariats
as
well
as
hobbled
for
indians
deem
it
no
disgrace
to
steal
or
tell
lies
though
they
think
it
disgraceful
to
be
found
out
in
doing
either
and
so
expert
are
these
natives
of
the
western
prairies
that
they
will
creep
into
the
midst
of
an
enemy
camp
cut
the
lariats
and
hobbles
of
several
horses
spring
suddenly
on
their
backs
and
gallop
away
they
not
only
steal
from
white
men
but
tribes
that
are
at
enmity
steal
from
each
other
and
the
boldness
with
which
they
do
this
is
most
remarkable
when
indians
are
travelling
in
a
country
where
enemies
are
prowling
they
guard
their
camps
at
night
with
jealous
care
the
horses
in
particular
are
both
hobbled
and
picketed
and
sentries
are
posted
all
round
the
camp
yet
in
spite
of
these
precautions
hostile
indians
manage
to
elude
the
sentries
and
creep
into
the
camp
when
a
thief
thus
succeeds
in
effecting
an
entrance
his
chief
danger
is
past
he
rises
boldly
to
his
feet
and
wrapping
his
blanket
or
buffalo
robe
round
him
he
walks
up
and
down
as
if
he
were
a
member
of
the
tribe
at
the
same
time
he
dexterously
cuts
the
lariats
of
such
horses
as
he
observes
are
not
hobbled
he
dare
not
stoop
to
cut
the
hobbles
as
the
action
would
be
observed
and
suspicion
would
be
instantly
aroused
he
then
leaps
on
the
best
horse
he
can
find
and
uttering
a
terrific
darts
away
into
the
plains
driving
the
loosened
horses
before
him
no
such
dark
thieves
were
supposed
to
be
near
the
camp
under
the
however
so
joe
and
dick
and
henri
ate
their
supper
in
comfort
and
let
their
horses
browse
at
will
on
the
rich
pasturage
a
bright
ruddy
fire
was
soon
kindled
which
created
as
it
were
a
little
ball
of
light
in
the
midst
of
surrounding
darkness
for
the
special
use
of
our
hardy
hunters
within
this
magic
circle
all
was
warm
comfortable
and
cheery
outside
all
was
dark
and
cold
and
dreary
by
contrast
when
the
substantial
part
of
supper
was
disposed
of
tea
and
pipes
were
introduced
and
conversation
began
to
flow
then
the
three
saddles
were
placed
in
a
row
each
hunter
wrapped
himself
in
his
blanket
and
pillowing
his
head
on
his
saddle
stretched
his
feet
towards
the
fire
and
went
to
sleep
with
his
loaded
rifle
by
his
side
and
his
handy
in
his
belt
crusoe
mounted
guard
by
stretching
himself
out
at
dick
varley
side
the
faithful
dog
slept
lightly
and
never
moved
all
night
but
had
any
one
observed
him
closely
he
would
have
seen
that
every
fitful
flame
that
burst
from
the
sinking
fire
every
unusual
puff
of
wind
and
every
motion
of
the
horses
that
fed
or
rested
hard
by
had
the
effect
of
revealing
a
speck
of
glittering
white
in
crusoe
watchful
eye
chapter
vi
great
prairies
of
the
far
remarkable
colony
discovered
and
a
miserable
night
of
all
the
hours
of
the
night
or
day
the
hour
that
succeeds
the
dawn
is
the
purest
the
most
joyous
and
the
best
at
least
so
think
we
and
so
think
hundreds
and
thousands
of
the
human
family
and
so
thought
dick
varley
as
he
sprang
suddenly
into
a
sitting
posture
next
morning
and
threw
his
arms
with
an
exulting
feeling
of
delight
round
the
neck
of
crusoe
who
instantly
sat
up
to
greet
him
this
was
an
unusual
piece
of
enthusiasm
on
the
part
of
dick
but
the
dog
received
it
with
marked
satisfaction
rubbed
his
big
hairy
cheek
against
that
of
his
young
master
and
arose
from
his
sedentary
position
in
order
to
afford
free
scope
for
the
use
of
his
tail
ho
joe
blunt
henri
up
boys
up
the
sun
will
have
the
start
us
i
catch
the
nags
so
saying
dick
bounded
away
into
the
woods
with
crusoe
gambolling
joyously
at
his
heels
dick
soon
caught
his
own
horse
and
crusoe
caught
joe
then
the
former
mounted
and
quickly
brought
in
the
other
two
returning
to
the
camp
he
found
everything
packed
and
ready
to
strap
on
the
back
of
the
that
the
way
to
do
it
lad
cried
joe
here
henri
look
alive
and
git
yer
beast
ready
i
do
believe
goin
to
take
another
snooze
henri
was
indeed
at
that
moment
indulging
in
a
gigantic
stretch
and
a
cavernous
yawn
but
he
finished
both
hastily
and
rushed
at
his
poor
horse
as
if
he
intended
to
slay
it
on
the
spot
he
only
threw
the
saddle
on
its
back
however
and
then
threw
himself
on
the
saddle
now
then
all
ready
ay
oui
yis
and
away
they
went
at
full
stretch
again
on
their
journey
thus
day
after
day
they
travelled
and
night
after
night
they
laid
them
down
to
sleep
under
the
trees
of
the
forest
until
at
length
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
great
prairie
it
was
a
great
a
memorable
day
in
the
life
of
dick
varley
that
on
which
he
first
beheld
the
prairie
the
vast
boundless
prairie
he
had
heard
of
it
talked
of
it
dreamed
about
it
but
he
had
never
no
he
had
never
realized
it
is
always
thus
our
conceptions
of
things
that
we
have
not
seen
are
almost
invariably
wrong
dick
eyes
glittered
and
his
heart
swelled
and
his
cheeks
flushed
and
his
breath
came
thick
and
quick
there
it
is
he
gasped
as
the
great
rolling
plain
broke
suddenly
on
his
enraptured
gaze
that
it
oh
dick
uttered
a
yell
that
would
have
done
credit
to
the
fiercest
chief
of
the
pawnees
and
being
unable
to
utter
another
word
he
swung
his
cap
in
the
air
and
sprang
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
over
the
mighty
ocean
of
grass
the
sun
had
just
risen
to
send
a
flood
of
golden
glory
over
the
scene
the
horses
were
fresh
so
the
elder
hunters
gladdened
by
the
beauty
of
all
around
them
and
inspired
by
the
irresistible
enthusiasm
of
their
young
companion
gave
the
reins
to
the
horses
and
flew
after
him
it
was
a
glorious
gallop
that
first
headlong
dash
over
the
boundless
prairie
of
the
far
west
the
prairies
have
often
been
compared
most
justly
to
the
ocean
there
is
the
same
wide
circle
of
space
bounded
on
all
sides
by
the
horizon
there
is
the
same
swell
or
undulation
or
succession
of
long
low
unbroken
waves
that
marks
the
ocean
when
it
is
calm
they
are
canopied
by
the
same
pure
sky
and
swept
by
the
same
untrammelled
breezes
there
are
islands
too
clumps
of
trees
and
which
rise
out
of
this
grassy
ocean
to
break
and
relieve
its
uniformity
and
these
vary
in
size
and
numbers
as
do
the
isles
of
ocean
being
numerous
in
some
places
while
in
others
they
are
so
scarce
that
the
traveller
does
not
meet
one
in
a
long
journey
thousands
of
beautiful
flowers
decked
the
greensward
and
numbers
of
little
birds
hopped
about
among
them
now
lads
said
joe
blunt
reining
up
our
troubles
begin
our
troubles
our
joys
you
mean
exclaimed
dick
varley
i
do
mean
nothin
o
the
sort
retorted
joe
man
wos
never
intended
to
swaller
his
joys
without
a
strong
mixtur
troubles
i
he
could
stand
pure
ye
see
we
got
to
the
prairie
now
one
blind
hoss
might
see
dat
interrupted
henri
an
we
may
or
may
not
diskiver
buffalo
an
water
scarce
too
so
we
need
to
look
out
for
it
pretty
sharp
i
guess
else
we
lose
our
horses
in
which
case
we
may
as
well
give
out
at
once
besides
there
rattlesnakes
about
in
sandy
places
we
ha
to
look
out
for
them
an
there
badger
holes
we
need
to
look
sharp
for
them
lest
the
horses
put
their
feet
in
an
there
injuns
who
look
out
pretty
sharp
for
if
they
once
get
wind
that
we
in
them
parts
oui
yis
mes
boys
and
there
rain
and
tunder
and
lightin
added
henri
pointing
to
a
dark
cloud
which
was
seen
rising
on
the
horizon
ahead
of
them
it
be
rain
remarked
joe
but
there
no
thunder
in
the
air
jist
now
we
make
for
yonder
clump
o
bushes
and
lay
by
till
it
past
turning
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
course
they
had
been
following
the
hunters
galloped
along
one
of
the
hollows
between
the
prairie
waves
before
mentioned
in
the
direction
of
a
clump
of
willows
before
reaching
it
however
they
passed
over
a
bleak
and
barren
plain
where
there
was
neither
flower
nor
bird
here
they
were
suddenly
arrested
by
a
most
extraordinary
sight
at
least
it
was
so
to
dick
varley
who
had
never
seen
the
like
before
this
was
a
colony
of
what
joe
called
on
first
beholding
them
crusoe
uttered
a
sort
of
half
growl
half
bark
of
surprise
cocked
his
tail
and
ears
and
instantly
prepared
to
charge
but
he
glanced
up
at
his
master
first
for
permission
observing
that
his
finger
and
his
look
commanded
silence
he
dropped
his
tail
at
once
and
stepped
to
the
rear
he
did
not
however
cease
to
regard
the
with
intense
curiosity
these
remarkable
little
creatures
have
been
egregiously
misnamed
by
the
hunters
of
the
west
for
they
bear
not
the
slightest
resemblance
to
dogs
either
in
formation
or
habits
they
are
in
fact
the
marmot
and
in
size
are
little
larger
than
squirrels
which
animals
they
resemble
in
some
degree
they
burrow
under
the
light
soil
and
throw
it
up
in
mounds
like
moles
thousands
of
them
were
running
about
among
their
dwellings
when
dick
first
beheld
them
but
the
moment
they
caught
sight
of
the
horsemen
rising
over
the
ridge
they
set
up
a
tremendous
hubbub
of
consternation
each
little
beast
instantly
mounted
guard
on
the
top
of
his
house
and
prepared
as
it
were
to
receive
cavalry
the
most
ludicrous
thing
about
them
was
that
although
the
most
timid
and
cowardly
creatures
in
the
world
they
seemed
the
most
impertinent
things
that
ever
lived
knowing
that
their
holes
afforded
them
a
perfectly
safe
retreat
they
sat
close
beside
them
and
as
the
hunters
slowly
approached
they
elevated
their
heads
wagged
their
little
tails
showed
their
teeth
and
chattered
at
them
like
monkeys
the
nearer
they
came
the
more
angry
and
furious
did
the
become
until
dick
varley
almost
fell
off
his
horse
with
suppressed
laughter
they
let
the
hunters
come
close
up
waxing
louder
and
louder
in
their
wrath
but
the
instant
a
hand
was
raised
to
throw
a
stone
or
point
a
gun
a
thousand
little
heads
dived
into
a
thousand
holes
and
a
thousand
little
tails
wriggled
for
an
instant
in
the
air
then
a
dead
silence
reigned
over
the
deserted
scene
bien
them
have
dive
into
de
of
de
eart
said
henri
with
a
broad
grin
presently
a
thousand
noses
appeared
and
nervously
disappeared
like
the
wink
of
an
eye
then
they
appeared
again
and
a
thousand
pair
of
eyes
followed
instantly
like
jack
in
the
box
they
were
all
on
the
top
of
their
hillocks
again
chattering
and
wagging
their
little
tails
as
vigorously
as
ever
you
could
not
say
that
you
them
jump
out
of
their
holes
suddenly
as
if
by
magic
they
out
then
dick
tossed
up
his
arms
and
suddenly
as
if
by
magic
they
were
gone
their
number
was
incredible
and
their
cities
were
full
of
riotous
activity
what
their
occupations
were
the
hunters
could
not
ascertain
but
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
they
visited
a
great
deal
and
gossiped
tremendously
for
they
ran
about
from
house
to
house
and
sat
chatting
in
groups
but
it
was
also
observed
that
they
never
went
far
from
their
own
houses
each
seemed
to
have
a
circle
of
acquaintance
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
his
own
residence
to
which
in
case
of
sudden
danger
he
always
fled
but
another
thing
about
these
perhaps
considering
their
size
we
should
call
them
another
thing
about
them
we
say
was
that
each
doggie
lived
with
an
owl
or
more
correctly
an
owl
lived
with
each
doggie
this
is
such
an
extraordinary
that
we
could
scarce
hope
that
men
would
believe
us
were
our
statement
not
supported
by
dozens
of
trustworthy
travellers
who
have
visited
and
written
about
these
regions
the
whole
plain
was
covered
with
these
owls
each
hole
seemed
to
be
the
residence
of
an
owl
and
a
doggie
and
these
incongruous
couples
lived
together
apparently
in
perfect
harmony
we
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
from
travellers
the
owls
have
gone
to
live
with
these
doggies
so
we
beg
humbly
to
offer
our
own
private
opinion
to
the
reader
we
assume
then
that
owls
find
it
absolutely
needful
to
have
holes
probably
can
not
dig
holes
for
themselves
having
discovered
however
a
race
of
little
creatures
that
could
they
very
likely
determined
to
take
forcible
possession
of
the
holes
made
by
them
finding
no
doubt
that
when
they
did
so
the
doggies
were
too
timid
to
object
and
discovering
moreover
that
they
were
sweet
innocent
little
creatures
the
owls
resolved
to
take
them
into
partnership
and
so
the
thing
was
settled
that
how
it
came
about
no
doubt
of
it
there
is
a
report
that
rattlesnakes
live
in
these
holes
also
but
we
can
not
certify
our
reader
of
the
truth
of
this
still
it
is
well
to
be
acquainted
with
a
report
that
is
current
among
the
men
of
the
backwoods
if
it
be
true
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
doggie
family
is
the
most
miscellaneous
and
remarkable
on
the
face
of
or
as
henri
said
in
the
of
the
earth
dick
and
his
friends
were
so
deeply
absorbed
in
watching
these
curious
little
creatures
that
they
did
not
observe
the
rapid
spread
of
the
black
clouds
over
the
sky
a
few
heavy
drops
of
rain
now
warned
them
to
seek
shelter
so
wheeling
round
they
dashed
off
at
full
speed
for
the
clump
of
willows
which
they
gained
just
as
the
rain
began
to
descend
in
torrents
now
lads
do
it
slick
off
packs
and
saddles
cried
joe
blunt
jumping
from
his
horse
i
make
a
hut
for
ye
right
off
a
hut
joe
what
sort
o
hut
can
ye
make
here
inquired
dick
ye
see

in
a
minute
ach
lend
me
a

dick
de
bockle
am
tight
as
de
hoss
own

ah
dere
all
right
hallo
what
this
exclaimed
dick
as
crusoe
advanced
with
something
in
his
mouth
i
declare
it
a
bird
o
some
sort
a
remarked
joe
as
crusoe
laid
the
bird
at
dick
feet
capital
for
supper
ah
dat
chien
is
superb
goot
dog
come
here
i
vill
clap
you
but
crusoe
refused
to
be
caressed
meanwhile
joe
and
dick
formed
a
sort
of
hut
by
bending
down
the
stems
of
a
tall
bush
and
thrusting
their
points
into
the
ground
over
this
they
threw
the
largest
buffalo
robe
and
placed
another
on
the
ground
below
it
on
which
they
laid
their
packs
of
goods
these
they
further
secured
against
wet
by
placing
several
robes
over
them
and
a
skin
of
parchment
then
they
sat
down
on
this
pile
to
rest
and
consider
what
should
be
done
next
is
a
bad
said
joe
shaking
his
head
i
fear
it
is
replied
dick
in
a
melancholy
tone
henri
said
nothing
but
he
sighed
deeply
on
looking
up
at
the
sky
which
was
now
of
a
uniform
watery
gray
while
black
clouds
drove
athwart
it
the
rain
was
pouring
in
torrents
and
the
wind
began
to
sweep
it
in
broad
sheets
over
the
plains
and
under
their
slight
covering
so
that
in
a
short
time
they
were
wet
to
the
skin
the
horses
stood
meekly
beside
them
with
their
tails
and
heads
equally
pendulous
and
crusoe
sat
before
his
master
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
could
you
put
a
stop
to
this
if
you
were
to
try
this
never
do
i
try
to
git
up
a
fire
said
dick
jumping
up
in
desperation
ye
may
save
yerself
the
trouble
remarked
joe
dryly
at
least
as
dryly
as
was
possible
in
the
circumstances
however
dick
did
try
but
he
failed
signally
everything
was
soaked
and
saturated
there
were
no
large
trees
most
of
the
bushes
were
green
and
the
dead
ones
were
soaked
the
coverings
were
slobbery
the
skins
they
sat
on
were
slobbery
the
earth
itself
was
slobbery
so
dick
threw
his
blanket
which
was
also
slobbery
round
his
shoulders
and
sat
down
beside
his
companions
to
grin
and
bear
it
as
for
joe
and
henri
they
were
old
hands
and
accustomed
to
such
circumstances
from
the
first
they
had
resigned
themselves
to
their
fate
and
wrapping
their
wet
blankets
round
them
sat
down
side
by
side
wisely
to
endure
the
evils
that
they
could
not
cure
there
is
an
old
rhyme
by
whom
composed
we
know
not
and
it
matters
little
which
runs
thus
for
every
evil
under
the
sun
there
is
a
remedy
or
there
none
if
there
is
try
and
find
it
if
there
is
never
mind
it
there
is
deep
wisdom
here
in
small
compass
the
principle
involved
deserves
to
be
heartily
recommended
dick
never
heard
of
the
lines
but
he
knew
the
principle
well
so
he
began
to
never
mind
it
by
sitting
down
beside
his
companions
and
whistling
vociferously
as
the
wind
rendered
this
a
difficult
feat
he
took
to
singing
instead
after
that
he
said
let
eat
a
bite
joe
and
then
go
to
bed
be
all
means
said
joe
who
produced
a
mass
of
dried
deer
meat
from
a
wallet
it
cold
grub
said
dick
and
tough
but
the
hunters
teeth
were
sharp
and
strong
so
they
ate
a
hearty
supper
and
washed
it
down
with
a
drink
of
rain
water
collected
from
a
pool
on
the
top
of
their
hut
they
now
tried
to
sleep
for
the
night
was
advancing
and
it
was
so
dark
that
they
could
scarce
see
their
hands
when
held
up
before
their
faces
they
sat
back
to
back
and
thus
in
the
form
of
a
tripod
began
to
snooze
joe
and
seasoned
frames
would
have
remained
stiff
as
posts
till
morning
but
dick
body
was
young
and
pliant
so
he
had
been
asleep
a
few
seconds
when
he
fell
forward
into
the
mud
and
effectually
awakened
the
others
joe
gave
a
grunt
and
henri
exclaimed
hah
but
dick
was
too
sleepy
and
miserable
to
say
anything
crusoe
however
rose
up
to
show
his
sympathy
and
laid
his
wet
head
on
his
master
knee
as
he
resumed
his
place
this
catastrophe
happened
three
times
in
the
space
of
an
hour
and
by
the
third
time
they
were
all
awakened
up
so
thoroughly
that
they
gave
up
the
attempt
to
sleep
and
amused
each
other
by
recounting
their
hunting
experiences
and
telling
stories
so
engrossed
did
they
become
that
day
broke
sooner
than
they
had
expected
and
just
in
proportion
as
the
gray
light
of
dawn
rose
higher
into
the
eastern
sky
did
the
spirits
of
these
weary
men
rise
within
their
soaking
bodies

the

the
day
that
succeeded
the
dreary
night
described
in
the
last

was
warm
and
magnificent
the
sun
rose
in
a
blaze
of
splendour
and
filled
the
atmosphere
with
steam
from
the
moist
earth
the
unfortunates
in
the
wet
camp
were
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
of
his
cheering
rays
they
hung
up
everything
on
the
bushes
to
dry
and
by
dint
of
extreme
patience
and
cutting
out
the
comparatively
dry
hearts
of
several
pieces
of
wood
they
lighted
a
fire
and
boiled
some
which
was
soon
converted
into
soup
this
and
the
exercise
necessary
for
the
performance
of
these
several
duties
warmed
and
partially
dried
them
so
that
when
they
once
more
mounted
their
steeds
and
rode
away
they
were
in
a
state
of
comparative
comfort
and
in
excellent
spirits
the
only
annoyance
was
the
clouds
of
mosquitoes
and
large
flies
that
assailed
men
and
horses
whenever
they
checked
their
speed
i
tell
ye
wot
it
is
said
joe
blunt
one
fine
morning
about
a
week
after
they
had
begun
to
cross
the
prairie
it
my
that
come
on
buffaloes
soon
them
tracks
are
fresh
an
yonder
one
their
wallers
that
bin
used
not
long
agone
i
go
have
a
look
at
it
cried
dick
trotting
away
as
he
spoke
everything
in
these
vast
prairies
was
new
to
dick
varley
and
he
was
kept
in
a
constant
state
of
excitement
during
the
first
week
or
two
of
his
journey
it
is
true
he
was
quite
familiar
with
the
names
and
habits
of
all
the
animals
that
dwelt
there
for
many
a
time
and
oft
had
he
listened
to
the
yarns
of
the
hunters
and
trappers
of
the
mustang
valley
when
they
returned
laden
with
rich
furs
from
their
periodical
hunting
expeditions
but
this
knowledge
of
his
only
served
to
whet
his
curiosity
and
his
desire
to
the
denizens
of
the
prairies
with
his
own
eyes
and
now
that
his
wish
was
accomplished
it
greatly
increased
the
pleasures
of
his
journey
dick
had
just
reached
the
wallow
referred
to
by
joe
blunt
and
had
reined
up
his
steed
to
observe
it
leisurely
when
a
faint
hissing
sound
reached
his
ear
looking
quickly
back
he
observed
his
two
companions
crouching
on
the
necks
of
their
horses
and
slowly
descending
into
a
hollow
of
the
prairie
in
front
of
them
as
if
they
wished
to
bring
the
rising
ground
between
them
and
some
object
in
advance
dick
instantly
followed
their
example
and
was
soon
at
their
heels
ye
need
look
at
the
waller
whispered
joe
for
a
tother
side
the
ridge
there
a
bull
ye
do
mean
it
exclaimed
dick
as
they
all
dismounted
and
picketed
their
horses
to
the
plain
oui
said
henri
tumbling
off
his
horse
while
a
broad
grin
overspread
his
countenance
it
is
one
fact

wollerin
like
a
enormerous
hog
also
dere
be
o

farder
on
can
ye
trust
yer
dog
keepin
back
inquired
joe
with
a
dubious
glance
at
crusoe
trust
him
ay
i
wish
i
was
as
sure
o
myself
look
to
yer
primin
then
an
we
have
tongues
and
marrow
bones
for
supper
warrant
hist
down
on
yer
knees
and
go
softly
we
might
ha
run
them
down
on
horseback
but
it
bad
to
wind
yer
beasts
on
a
trip
like
this
if
ye
can
help
it
an
it
about
as
easy
to
stalk
them
leastways
we
try
lift
yer
head
slowly
dick
an
do
show
more
nor
the
half
above
the
ridge
dick
elevated
his
head
as
directed
and
the
scene
that
met
his
view
was
indeed
well
calculated
to
send
an
electric
shock
to
the
heart
of
an
ardent
sportsman
the
vast
plain
beyond
was
absolutely
blackened
with
countless
herds
of
buffaloes
which
were
browsing
on
the
rich
grass
they
were
still
so
far
distant
that
their
bellowing
and
the
trampling
of
their
myriad
hoofs
only
reached
the
hunters
like
a
faint
murmur
on
the
breeze
in
the
immediate
foreground
however
there
was
a
group
of
about
buffalo
cows
feeding
quietly
and
in
the
midst
of
them
an
enormous
old
bull
was
enjoying
himself
in
his
wallow
the
animals
towards
which
our
hunters
now
crept
with
murderous
intent
are
the
fiercest
and
the
most
ponderous
of
the
ruminating
inhabitants
of
the
western
wilderness
the
name
of
however
is
not
correct
the
animal
is
the
and
bears
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
buffalo
proper
but
as
the
hunters
of
the
far
west
and
indeed
travellers
generally
have
adopted
the
misnomer
we
bow
to
the
authority
of
custom
and
adopt
it
too
buffaloes
roam
in
countless
thousands
all
over
the
north
american
prairies
from
the
hudson
bay
territories
north
of
canada
to
the
shores
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
advance
of
white
men
to
the
west
has
driven
them
to
the
prairies
between
the
missouri
and
the
rocky
mountains
and
has
somewhat
diminished
their
numbers
but
even
thus
diminished
they
are
still
innumerable
in
the
more
distant
plains
their
colour
is
dark
brown
but
it
varies
a
good
deal
with
the
seasons
the
hair
or
fur
from
its
great
length
in
winter
and
spring
and
exposure
to
the
weather
turns
quite
light
but
when
the
winter
coat
is
shed
off
the
new
growth
is
a
beautiful
dark
brown
almost
approaching
to
in
form
the
buffalo
somewhat
resembles
the
ox
but
its
head
and
shoulders
are
much
larger
and
are
covered
with
a
profusion
of
long
shaggy
hair
which
adds
greatly
to
the
fierce
aspect
of
the
animal
it
has
a
large
hump
on
the
shoulder
and
its
are
much
larger
in
proportion
than
the
the
horns
are
short
and
thick
the
hoofs
are
cloven
and
the
tail
is
short
with
a
tuft
of
hair
at
the
extremity
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
conceive
a
wilder
or
more
ferocious
and
terrible
monster
than
a
buffalo
bull
he
often
grows
to
the
enormous
weight
of
two
thousand
pounds
his
mane
falls
in
shaggy
confusion
quite
over
his
head
and
shoulders
down
to
the
ground
when
he
is
wounded
he
becomes
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
a
tiger
he
stamps
bellows
roars
and
foams
forth
his
rage
with
glaring
eyes
and
steaming
nostrils
and
charges
furiously
at
man
and
horse
with
utter
recklessness
fortunately
however
he
is
not
naturally
pugnacious
and
can
be
easily
thrown
into
a
sudden
panic
moreover
the
peculiar
position
of
his
eye
renders
this
creature
not
so
terrible
as
he
would
otherwise
be
to
the
hunter
owing
to
the
stiff
structure
of
the
neck
and
the
sunken
eyeball
the
buffalo
can
not
without
an
effort
see
beyond
the
direct
line
of
vision
presented
to
the
habitual
carriage
of
his
head
when
therefore
he
is
wounded
and
charges
he
does
so
in
a
straight
line
so
that
his
pursuer
can
leap
easily
out
of
his
way
the
pace
of
the
buffalo
is
clumsy
and
slow
yet
when
chased
he
dashes
away
over
the
plains
in
blind
blundering
terror
at
a
rate
that
leaves
all
but
good
horses
far
behind
he
can
not
keep
the
pace
up
however
and
is
usually
soon
overtaken
were
the
buffalo
capable
of
the
same
alert
and
agile
motions
of
head
and
eye
peculiar
to
the
deer
or
wild
horse
in
addition
to
his
bovine
rage
he
would
be
the
most
formidable
brute
on
earth
there
is
no
object
perhaps
so
terrible
as
the
headlong
advance
of
a
herd
of
these
animals
when
thoroughly
aroused
by
terror
they
care
not
for
their
necks
all
danger
in
front
is
forgotten
or
not
seen
in
the
terror
of
that
from
which
they
fly
no
thundering
cataract
is
more
tremendously
irresistible
than
the
black
bellowing
torrent
which
sometimes
pours
through
the
narrow
defiles
of
the
rocky
mountains
or
sweeps
like
a
roaring
flood
over
the
trembling
plains
the
wallowing
to
which
we
have
referred
is
a
luxury
usually
indulged
in
during
the
hot
months
of
summer
when
the
buffaloes
are
tormented
by
flies
and
heat
and
drought
at
this
season
they
seek
the
low
grounds
in
the
prairies
where
there
is
a
little
stagnant
water
lying
amongst
the
grass
and
the
ground
underneath
being
saturated
is
soft
the
leader
of
the
herd
a
shaggy
old
bull
usually
takes
upon
himself
to
prepare
the
wallow
it
was
a
rugged
monster
of
the
largest
size
that
did
so
on
the
present
occasion
to
the
intense
delight
of
dick
varley
who
begged
joe
to
lie
still
and
watch
the
operation
before
trying
to
shoot
one
of
the
buffalo
cows
joe
consented
with
a
nod
and
the
four
spectators
for
crusoe
was
as
much
taken
up
with
the
proceedings
as
any
of
them
crouched
in
the
grass
and
looked
on
coming
up
to
the
swampy
spot
the
old
bull
gave
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
going
down
on
one
knee
plunged
his
short
thick
horns
into
the
mud
tore
it
up
and
cast
it
aside
having
repeated
this
several
times
he
plunged
his
head
in
and
brought
it
forth
saturated
with
dirty
water
and
bedaubed
with
lumps
of
mud
through
which
his
fierce
eyes
gazed
with
a
ludicrous
expression
of
astonishment
straight
in
the
direction
of
the
hunters
as
if
he
meant
to
say
i
done
it
that
time
and
no
mistake
the
other
buffaloes
seemed
to
think
so
too
for
they
came
up
and
looked
on
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
well
done
old
fellow
try
that
again
the
old
fellow
did
try
it
again
and
again
and
again
plunging
and
ramming
and
tearing
up
the
earth
until
he
formed
an
excavation
large
enough
to
contain
his
huge
body
in
this
bath
he
laid
himself
comfortably
down
and
began
to
roll
and
wallow
about
until
he
mixed
up
a
trough
full
of
thin
soft
mud
which
completely
covered
him
when
he
came
out
of
the
hole
there
was
scarcely
an
atom
of
his
former
self
visible
the
coat
of
mud
thus
put
on
by
bulls
is
usually
permitted
by
them
to
dry
and
is
not
finally
got
rid
of
until
long
after
when
rollings
on
the
grass
and
washings
by
rain
at
length
clear
it
away
when
the
old
bull
vacated
this
delectable
bath
another
bull
scarcely
if
at
all
less
stepped
forward
to
take
his
turn
but
he
was
interrupted
by
a
volley
from
the
hunters
which
scattered
the
animals
right
and
left
and
sent
the
mighty
herds
in
the
distance
flying
over
the
prairie
in
wild
terror
the
very
turmoil
of
their
own
mad
flight
added
to
their
panic
and
the
continuous
thunder
of
their
hoofs
was
heard
until
the
last
of
them
disappeared
on
the
horizon
the
family
party
which
had
been
fired
at
however
did
not
escape
so
well
joe
rifle
wounded
a
fat
young
cow
and
dick
varley
brought
it
down
henri
had
done
his
best
but
as
the
animals
were
too
far
distant
for
his
limited
vision
he
missed
the
cow
he
fired
at
and
hit
the
young
bull
whose
bath
had
been
interrupted
the
others
scattered
and
fled
well
done
dick
exclaimed
joe
blunt
as
they
all
ran
up
to
the
cow
that
had
fallen
your
first
shot
at
the
buffalo
was
a
good
un
come
now
an
i
show
ye
how
to
cut
it
up
an
carry
off
the
ah
mon
dear
ole
bull
exclaimed
henri
gazing
after
the
animal
which
he
had
wounded
and
which
was
now
limping
slowly
away
you
is
not
worth
goin
after
farewell
adieu
he
be
tough
enough
i
warrant
said
joe
an
we
more
meat
here
nor
we
can
lift
but
would
it
be
as
well
to
put
the
poor
brute
out
o
pain
suggested
dick
oh
he
die
soon
enough
replied
joe
tucking
up
his
sleeves
and
drawing
his
long
dick
however
was
not
satisfied
with
this
way
of
looking
at
it
saying
that
he
would
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
he
reloaded
his
rifle
and
calling
crusoe
to
his
side
walked
quickly
after
the
wounded
bull
which
was
now
hid
from
view
in
a
hollow
of
the
plain
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
in
sight
of
it
and
ran
forward
with
his
rifle
in
readiness
down
crusoe
he
whispered
wait
for
me
here
crusoe
crouched
in
the
grass
instantly
and
dick
advanced
as
he
came
on
the
bull
observed
him
and
turned
round
bellowing
with
rage
and
pain
to
receive
him
the
aspect
of
the
brute
on
a
near
view
was
so
terrible
that
dick
involuntarily
stopped
too
and
gazed
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
wonder
and
awe
while
it
bristled
with
passion
and
foam
dropped
from
its
open
jaws
and
its
eyes
glared
furiously
seeing
that
dick
did
not
advance
the
bull
charged
him
with
a
terrific
roar
but
the
youth
had
firm
nerves
and
although
the
rush
of
such
a
savage
creature
at
full
speed
was
calculated
to
try
the
courage
of
any
man
especially
one
who
had
never
seen
a
buffalo
bull
before
dick
did
not
lose
presence
of
mind
he
remembered
the
many
stories
he
had
listened
to
of
this
very
thing
that
was
now
happening
so
crushing
down
his
excitement
as
well
as
he
could
he
cocked
his
rifle
and
awaited
the
charge
he
knew
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
fire
at
the
head
of
the
advancing
foe
as
the
thickness
of
the
skull
together
with
the
matted
hair
on
the
forehead
rendered
it
impervious
to
a
bullet
when
the
bull
was
within
a
yard
of
him
he
leaped
lightly
to
one
side
and
it
passed
just
as
it
did
so
dick
aimed
at
its
heart
and
fired
but
his
knowledge
of
the
creature
anatomy
was
not
yet
correct
the
ball
entered
the
shoulder
too
high
and
the
bull
checking
himself
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
headlong
rush
turned
round
and
made
at
dick
again
the
failure
coupled
with
the
excitement
proved
too
much
for
dick
he
could
not
resist
discharging
his
second
barrel
at
the
brute
head
as
it
came
on
he
might
as
well
have
fired
at
a
brick
wall
it
shook
its
shaggy
front
and
with
a
hideous
bellow
thundered
forward
again
dick
sprang
to
one
side
but
in
doing
so
a
tuft
of
grass
or
a
stone
caught
his
foot
and
he
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
up
to
this
point
crusoe
admirable
training
had
nailed
him
to
the
spot
where
he
had
been
left
although
the
twitching
of
every
fibre
in
his
body
and
a
low
continuous
whine
showed
how
gladly
he
would
have
hailed
permission
to
join
in
the
combat
but
the
instant
he
saw
his
master
down
and
the
buffalo
turning
to
charge
again
he
sprang
forward
with
a
roar
that
would
have
done
credit
to
his
bovine
enemy
and
seized
him
by
the
nose
so
vigorous
was
the
rush
that
he
pulled
the
bull
down
on
its
side
one
toss
of
its
head
however
sent
crusoe
high
into
the
air
but
it
accomplished
this
feat
at
the
expense
of
its
nose
which
was
torn
and
lacerated
by
the
dog
teeth
scarcely
had
crusoe
touched
the
ground
which
he
did
with
a
sounding
thump
than
he
sprang
up
and
flew
at
his
adversary
again
this
time
however
he
adopted
the
plan
of
barking
furiously
and
biting
by
rapid
yet
terrible
snaps
as
he
found
opportunity
thus
keeping
the
bull
entirely
engrossed
and
affording
dick
an
opportunity
of
reloading
his
rifle
which
he
was
not
slow
to
do
dick
then
stepped
close
up
and
while
the
two
combatants
were
roaring
in
each
other
faces
he
shot
the
buffalo
through
the
heart
it
fell
to
the
earth
with
a
deep
groan
crusoe
rage
instantly
vanished
on
beholding
this
and
he
seemed
to
be
filled
with
tumultuous
joy
at
his
master
escape
for
he
gambolled
round
him
and
whined
and
fawned
upon
him
in
a
manner
that
could
not
be
misunderstood
good
dog
my
pup
said
dick
patting
crusoe
head
as
he
stooped
to
brush
the
dust
from
his
leggings
i
do
know
what
would
ha
become
o
me
but
for
your
help
crusoe
crusoe
turned
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
wagged
his
tail
and
looked
at
dick
with
an
expression
that
said
quite
plainly
i
die
for
you
i
would
not
once
or
twice
but
ten
times
fifty
times
if
need
be
and
that
not
merely
to
save
your
life
but
even
to
please
you
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
crusoe
felt
something
of
this
sort
the
love
of
a
newfoundland
dog
to
its
master
is
beyond
calculation
or
expression
he
who
once
gains
such
love
carries
the
dog
life
in
his
hand
but
let
him
who
reads
note
well
and
remember
that
there
is
only
one
coin
that
can
purchase
such
love
and
that
is
the
coin
too
must
be
genuine
kindness
merely
will
not
do
it
must
be
hallo
boy
ye
bin
i
the
wars
exclaimed
joe
raising
himself
from
his
task
as
dick
and
crusoe
returned
you
look
more
like
it
than
i
do
retorted
dick
laughing
this
was
true
for
cutting
up
a
buffalo
carcass
with
no
other
instrument
than
a
large
knife
is
no
easy
matter
yet
western
hunters
and
indians
can
do
it
without
cleaver
or
saw
in
a
way
that
would
surprise
a
civilized
butcher
not
a
little
joe
was
covered
with
blood
up
to
the
elbows
his
hair
happening
to
have
a
knack
of
getting
into
his
eyes
had
been
so
often
brushed
off
with
bloody
hands
that
his
whole
visage
was
speckled
with
gore
and
his
dress
was
by
no
means
immaculate
while
dick
related
his
adventure
or
with
the
bull
joe
and
henri
completed
the
cutting
out
of
the
most
delicate
portions
of
the
buffalo
namely
the
hump
on
its
shoulder
which
is
a
choice
piece
much
finer
than
the
best
beef
and
the
tongue
and
a
few
other
parts
the
tongues
of
buffaloes
are
superior
to
those
of
domestic
cattle
when
all
was
ready
the
meat
was
slung
across
the
back
of
the
and
the
party
remounting
their
horses
continued
their
journey
having
first
cleansed
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
rather
dirty
waters
of
an
old
wallow
see
said
henri
turning
to
dick
and
pointing
to
a
circular
spot
of
green
as
they
rode
along
that
is
one
old
waller
ay
remarked
joe
after
the
waller
dries
it
becomes
a
ring
greener
grass
than
the
rest
o
the
plain
as
ye
see
tis
said
the
first
hunters
used
to
wonder
greatly
at
these
circles
and
they
invented
all
sorts
o
stories
to
account
for
some
said
they
wos
but
at
last
they
comed
to
know
they
wos
nothin
more
nor
less
than
places
where
buffaloes
wos
used
to
waller
in
it
often
seemed
to
me
that
if
we
knowed
the
o
things
we
would
be
so
much
puzzled
wi
them
as
we
are
the
truth
of
this
last
remark
was
so
and
incontrovertible
that
it
elicited
no
reply
and
the
three
friends
rode
on
for
a
considerable
time
in
silence
it
was
now
past
noon
and
they
were
thinking
of
calling
a
halt
for
a
short
rest
to
the
horses
and
a
pipe
to
themselves
when
joe
was
heard
to
give
vent
to
one
of
those
peculiar
hisses
that
always
accompanied
either
a
surprise
or
a
caution
in
the
present
case
it
indicated
both
what
now
joe
injuns
ejaculated
joe
eh
fat
you
say
ou
is
dey
crusoe
at
this
moment
uttered
a
low
growl
ever
since
the
day
he
had
been
partially
roasted
he
had
maintained
a
rooted
antipathy
to
joe
immediately
dismounted
and
placing
his
ear
to
the
ground
listened
intently
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
by
placing
the
ear
close
to
the
ground
sounds
can
be
heard
distinctly
which
could
not
be
heard
at
all
if
the
listener
were
to
maintain
an
erect
position
they
arter
the
buffalo
said
joe
rising
an
i
think
likely
they
a
band
o
pawnees
listen
an
ye
hear
their
shouts
quite
plain
dick
and
henri
immediately
lay
down
and
placed
their
ears
to
the
ground
now
me
hear
noting
said
henri
jumping
up
but
me
ear
is
like
me
eyes
ver
i
do
hear
something
said
dick
as
he
got
up
but
the
beating
o
my
own
heart
makes
row
enough
to
spoil
my
hearin
joe
blunt
smiled
ah
lad
ye
young
an
yer
blood
too
hot
yet
but
bide
a
bit
you
cool
down
soon
i
wos
like
you
once
now
lads
what
think
ye
we
should
do
you
know
best
joe
oui
nodoubtedly
then
wot
i
advise
is
that
we
gallop
to
the
broken
sand
hillocks
ye
see
yonder
get
behind
them
an
take
a
peep
at
the
redskins
if
they
are
pawnees
we
go
up
to
them
at
once
if
not
we
hold
a
council
o
war
on
the
spot
having
arranged
this
they
mounted
and
hastened
towards
the
hillocks
in
question
which
they
reached
after
ten
minutes
gallop
at
full
stretch
the
sandy
mounds
afforded
them
concealment
and
enabled
them
to
watch
the
proceedings
of
the
savages
in
the
plain
below
the
scene
was
the
most
curious
and
exciting
that
can
be
conceived
the
centre
of
the
plain
before
them
was
crowded
with
hundreds
of
buffaloes
which
were
dashing
about
in
the
most
frantic
state
of
alarm
to
whatever
point
they
galloped
they
were
met
by
yelling
savages
on
horseback
who
could
not
have
been
fewer
in
numbers
than
a
thousand
all
being
armed
with
lance
bow
and
quiver
and
mounted
on
active
little
horses
the
indians
had
completely
surrounded
the
herd
of
buffaloes
and
were
now
advancing
steadily
towards
them
gradually
narrowing
the
circle
and
whenever
the
terrified
animals
endeavoured
to
break
through
the
line
they
rushed
to
that
particular
spot
in
a
body
and
scared
them
back
again
into
the
centre
thus
they
advanced
until
they
closed
in
on
their
prey
and
formed
an
unbroken
circle
round
them
whilst
the
poor
brutes
kept
eddying
and
surging
to
and
fro
in
a
confused
mass
hooking
and
climbing
upon
each
other
and
bellowing
furiously
suddenly
the
horsemen
made
a
rush
and
the
work
of
destruction
began
the
tremendous
turmoil
raised
a
cloud
of
dust
that
obscured
the
field
in
some
places
and
hid
it
from
our
hunters
view
some
of
the
indians
galloped
round
and
round
the
circle
sending
their
arrows
whizzing
up
to
the
feathers
in
the
sides
of
the
fattest
cows
others
dashed
fearlessly
into
the
midst
of
the
black
heaving
mass
and
with
their
long
lances
pierced
dozens
of
them
to
the
heart
in
many
instances
the
buffaloes
infuriated
by
wounds
turned
fiercely
on
their
assailants
and
gored
the
horses
to
death
in
which
cases
the
men
had
to
trust
to
their
nimble
legs
for
safety
sometimes
a
horse
got
jammed
in
the
centre
of
the
swaying
mass
and
could
neither
advance
nor
retreat
then
the
savage
rider
leaped
upon
the
buffaloes
backs
and
springing
from
one
to
another
like
an
acrobat
gained
the
outer
edge
of
the
circle
not
failing
however
in
his
strange
flight
to
pierce
with
his
lance
several
of
the
fattest
of
his
as
he
sped
along
a
few
of
the
herd
succeeded
in
escaping
from
the
blood
and
dust
of
this
desperate
battle
and
made
off
over
the
plains
but
they
were
quickly
overtaken
and
the
lance
or
the
arrow
brought
them
down
on
the
green
turf
many
of
the
dismounted
riders
were
chased
by
bulls
but
they
stepped
lightly
to
one
side
and
as
the
animals
passed
drove
their
arrows
deep
into
their
sides
thus
the
tumultuous
war
went
on
amid
thundering
tread
and
yell
and
bellow
till
the
green
plain
was
transformed
into
a
sea
of
blood
and
mire
and
every
buffalo
of
the
herd
was
laid
low
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
such
reckless
warfare
is
invariably
waged
without
damage
to
the
savages
many
were
the
wounds
and
bruises
received
that
day
and
not
a
few
bones
were
broken
but
happily
no
lives
were
lost
now
lads
now
our
time
a
bold
and
fearless
look
the
best
at
all
times

saying
this
joe
blunt
leaped
on
his
horse
and
bounding
over
the
ridge
at
full
speed
galloped
headlong
across
the
plain
the
savages
observed
the
strangers
instantly
and
a
loud
yell
announced
the
fact
as
they
assembled
from
all
parts
of
the
field
brandishing
their
bows
and
spears
joe
quick
eye
soon
distinguished
their
chief
towards
whom
he
galloped
still
at
full
speed
till
within
a
yard
or
two
of
his
horse
head
then
he
reined
up
suddenly
so
rapidly
did
joe
and
his
comrades
approach
and
so
instantaneously
did
they
pull
up
that
their
steeds
were
thrown
almost
on
their
haunches
the
indian
chief
did
not
move
a
muscle
he
was
a
tall
powerful
savage
almost
naked
and
mounted
on
a
charger
which
he
sat
with
the
ease
of
a
man
accustomed
to
ride
from
infancy
he
was
indeed
a
savage
but
his
face
wore
a
dark
frown
for
although
he
and
his
band
had
visited
the
settlements
and
trafficked
with
the
on
the
missouri
he
did
not
love
the
whom
he
regarded
as
intruders
on
the
of
his
fathers
and
the
peace
that
existed
between
them
at
that
time
was
of
a
very
fragile
character
indeed
it
was
deemed
by
the
traders
impossible
to
travel
through
the
indian
country
at
that
period
except
in
strong
force
and
it
was
the
very
boldness
of
the
present
attempt
that
secured
to
our
hunters
anything
like
a
civil
reception
joe
who
could
speak
the
pawnee
tongue
fluently
began
by
explaining
the
object
of
his
visit
and
spoke
of
the
presents
which
he
had
brought
for
the
great
chief
but
it
was
evident
that
his
words
made
little
impression
as
he
discoursed
to
them
the
savages
crowded
round
the
little
party
and
began
to
handle
and
examine
their
dresses
and
weapons
with
a
degree
of
rudeness
that
caused
joe
considerable
anxiety
mahtawa
believes
that
the
heart
of
the
is
true
said
the
savage
when
joe
paused
but
he
does
not
choose
to
make
peace
the
are
grasping
they
never
rest
they
turn
their
eyes
to
the
great
mountains
and
say
we
will
stop
but
even
there
they
will
not
stop
they
are
never
satisfied
mahtawa
knows
them
well
this
speech
sank
like
a
into
the
hearts
of
the
hunters
for
they
knew
that
if
the
savages
refused
to
make
peace
they
would
scalp
them
all
and
appropriate
their
goods
to
make
things
worse
a
indian
suddenly
caught
hold
of
henri
rifle
and
ere
he
was
aware
had
plucked
it
from
his
hand
the
blood
rushed
to
the
gigantic
hunter
forehead
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
springing
at
the
man
when
joe
said
in
a
deep
quiet
voice
be
still
henri
you
will
but
hasten
death
at
this
moment
there
was
a
movement
in
the
outskirts
of
the
circle
of
horsemen
and
another
chief
rode
into
the
midst
of
them
he
was
evidently
higher
in
rank
than
mahtawa
for
he
spoke
authoritatively
to
the
crowd
and
stepped
in
before
him
the
hunters
drew
little
comfort
from
the
appearance
of
his
face
however
for
it
scowled
upon
them
he
was
not
so
powerful
a
man
as
mahtawa
but
he
was
more
gracefully
formed
and
had
a
more
noble
and
commanding
countenance

no
wigwams
on
the

they
should
come
to
spy
out
the
lands
of

he
demanded
we
have
not
come
to
spy
your
country
answered
joe
raising
himself
proudly
as
he
spoke
and
taking
off
his
cap
we
have
come
with
a
message
from
the
great
chief
of
the
who
lives
in
the
village
far
beyond
the
great
river
where
the
sun
rises
he
says
why
should

does

to

footnote

at
the
mention
of

the
face
of
the
wily
chief
brightened
for

moment
then
he
said
sternly
the
heart
of
the
is
not
true
he
has
come
here
to
trade
for
himself

joe
is

and

understand
this

awaiting
him

evidently
mollified

he
said

will
go
with
us
to

course
joe
was
too
glad
to
agree
to
this
proposal
but
he
now
deemed
it
politic
to
display
a
little
firmness
we
can
not
go
till
our
rifle
is
restored
it
will
not
do
to
go
back
and
tell
the
great
chief
of
the
that
the
pawnees
are
thieves
the
chief
frowned
angrily
the
pawnees
are
true
they
are
not
thieves
they
choose
to
at
the
rifle
of
the
it
shall
be
returned
the
rifle
was
instantly
restored
and
then
our
hunters
rode
off
with
the
indians
towards
their
camp
on
the
way
they
met
hundreds
of
women
and
children
going
to
the
scene
of
the
great
hunt
for
it
was
their
special
duty
to
cut
up
the
meat
and
carry
it

had
done
quite

to

away
the

rode

dandy
a
the
pawnee
village
at
which
they
soon
arrived
was
situated
in
the
midst
of
a
most
interesting
and
picturesque
scene
it
occupied
an
extensive
plain
which
sloped
gently
down
to
a
creek
whose
winding
course
was
marked
by
a
broken
line
of
wood
here
and
there
interspersed
with
a
fine
clump
of
trees
between
the
trunks
of
which
the
blue
waters
of
a
lake
sparkled
in
the
distance
hundreds
of
tents
or
lodges
of
covered
the
ground
and
thousands
of
indians
men
women
and
children
moved
about
the
busy
scene
some
were
sitting
in
their
lodges
lazily
smoking
their
pipes
but
these
were
chiefly
old
and
infirm
veterans
for
all
the
young
men
had
gone
to
the
hunt
which
we
have
just
described
the
women
were
stooping
over
their
fires
busily
preparing
maize
and
meat
for
their
husbands
and
brothers
while
myriads
of
little
brown
and
naked
children
romped
about
everywhere
filling
the
air
with
their
yells
and
screams
which
were
only
equalled
if
not
surpassed
by
the
yelping
dogs
that
seemed
innumerable
footnote
in
america
small
rivers
or
rivulets
are
termed
creeks
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
were
seen
scattered
herds
of
horses
these
were
tended
by
little
boys
who
were
totally
destitute
of
clothing
and
who
seemed
to
enjoy
with
infinite
zest
the
pastime
of
with
little
bows
and
arrows
no
wonder
that
these
indians
become
expert
bowmen
there
were
urchins
there
scarce
two
feet
high
with
round
bullets
of
bodies
and
short
who
could
knock
blackbirds
off
the
trees
at
every
shot
and
cut
the
heads
off
the
taller
flowers
with
perfect
certainty
there
was
much

for
the
utmost
proficiency
they
could
attain
for
the
very
existence
of
the
indian
tribes
of
the
prairies
depends
on
their
success
in
hunting
the
buffalo
there
are
hundreds
and
thousands
of
north
american
savages
who
would
undoubtedly
perish
and
their
tribes
become
extinct
if
the
buffaloes
were
to
leave
the
prairies
or
die
out
yet
although
animals
are
absolutely
essential
to
their
existence
they
pursue
and
slay
them
with
improvident
recklessness
sometimes
killing
hundreds
of
them
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
sport
the
tongues
and
the
marrow
bones
in
the
bloody
hunt
described
in
the
last
chapter
however
the
slaughter
of
so
many
was
not
wanton
because
the
village
that
had
to
be
supplied
with
food
was
large
and
just
previous
to
the
hunt
they
had
been
living
on
somewhat
reduced
allowance
even
the
blackbirds
shot
by
the
urchins
before
mentioned
had
been
thankfully
put
into
the
pot
thus
precarious
is
the
supply
of
food
among
the
who
on
one
day
are
starving
and
the
next
are
revelling
in
superabundance
but
to
return
to
our
story
at
one
end
of
this
village
the
creek
sprang
over
a
ledge
of
rock
in
a
low
cascade
and
opened
out
into
a
beautiful
lake
the
bosom
of
which
was
studded
with
small
islands
here
were
thousands
of
those
smaller
species
of
wild
which
were
either
too
brave
or
too
foolish
to
be
scared
away
by
the
noise
of
the
camp
and
here
too
dozens
of
children
were
sporting
on
the
beach
or
paddling
about
in
their
light
bark
canoes
is
it
strange
remarked
dick
to
henri
as
they
passed
among
the
tents
towards
the
centre
of
the
village
is
it
strange
that
them
injuns
should
be
so
fond

when
they
got
all
they
can
want

one
would
think
the
hunt
we
seed
a
little
agone
would
be
excitement
enough
but
i
say
that
must
he
the
chiefs
tent
by
the
look
dick
was
right
the
horsemen
pulled
up
and
dismounted
opposite
the
principal
chief
tent
which
was
a
larger
and
more
elegant
structure
than
the
others
meanwhile
an
immense
concourse
of
women
children
and
dogs
gathered
round
the
strangers
and
while
the
latter
yelped
their
dislike
to
white
men
the
former
chattered
continuously
as
they
discussed
the
appearance
of
the
strangers
and
their
errand
which
latter
soon
became
known
an
end
was
put
to
this
by
desiring
the
hunters
to
enter
the
tent
and
spreading
a
buffalo
robe
for
them
to
sit
on
two
braves
carried
in
their
packs
and
then
led
away
their
horses
all
this
time
crusoe
had
kept
as
close
as
possible
to
his
side
feeling
extremely
uncomfortable
in
the
midst
of
such
a
strange
crowd
the
more
especially
that
the
indian
curs
gave
him
expressive
looks
of
hatred
and
exhibited
some
desire
to
rush
upon
him
in
a
body
so
that
he
had
to
keep
a
sharp
all
round
him
when
therefore
dick
entered
the
tent
crusoe
endeavoured
to
do
so
along
with
him
but
he
was
met
by
a
blow
on
the
nose
from
an
old
squaw
who
scolded
him
in
a
shrill
voice
and
bade
him
begone
either
our
hero
knowledge
of
the
indian
language
was
insufficient
to
enable
him
to
understand
the
order
or
he
had
resolved
not
to
obey
it
for
instead
of
retreating
he
drew
a
deep
gurgling
breath
curled
his
nose
and
displayed
a
row
of
teeth
that
caused
the
old
woman
to
draw
back
in
alarm
crusoe
was
a
forgiving
spirit
the
instant
that
opposition
ceased
he
forgot
the
injury
and
was
meekly
advancing
when
dick
held
up
his
finger
go
outside
pup
and
wait
crusoe
tail
drooped
with
a
deep
sigh
he
turned
and
left
the
tent
he
took
up
a
position
near
the
entrance
however
and
sat
down
resignedly
so
meek
indeed
did
the
poor
dog
look
that
six
curs
felt
their
dastardly
hearts
emboldened
to
make
a
rush
at
him
with
boisterous
yells
crusoe
did
not
rise
he
did
not
even
condescend
to
turn
his
head
toward
them
but
he
looked
at
them
out
of
the
corner
of
his
dark
eye
wrinkled
very
slightly
the
skin
of
his
nose
exhibited
two
beautiful
fangs
and
gave
utterance
to
a
soft
remark
that
might
be
described
as
quiet
gurgling
it
was
much
but
it
was
more
than
enough
for
the
valiant
six
who
paused
and
snarled
violently
it
was
a
peculiar
trait
of
crusoe
gentle
nature
that
the
moment
any
danger
ceased
he
resumed
his
expression
of
nonchalant
gravity
the
expression
on
this
occasion
was
misunderstood
however
and
as
about
two
dozen
additional
yelping
dogs
had
joined
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
they
advanced
in
close
order
to
the
attack
crusoe
still
sat
quiet
and
kept
his
head
high
but
he
at
them
again
and
exhibited
four
fangs
for
their
inspection
among
the
pack
there
was
one
indian
dog
of
large
size
almost
as
large
as
crusoe
himself
which
kept
well
in
the
rear
and
apparently
urged
the
lesser
dogs
on
the
little
dogs
did
object
for
little
dogs
are
generally
the
most
pugnacious
at
this
big
dog
crusoe
directed
a
pointed
glance
but
said
nothing
meanwhile
a
particularly
small
and
vicious
cur
with
a
mere
rag
of
a
tail
crept
round
by
the
back
of
the
tent
and
coming
upon
crusoe
in
rear
snapped
at
his
tail
sharply
and
then
fled
shrieking
with
terror
and
surprise
no
doubt
at
its
own
temerity
crusoe
did
not
bark
he
seldom
barked
he
usually
either
said
nothing
or
gave
utterance
to
a
prolonged
roar
of
indignation
of
the
most
terrible
character
with
barks
as
it
were
mingled
through
it
it
somewhat
resembled
that
peculiar
and
species
of
thunder
the
prolonged
roll
of
which
is
marked
at
short
intervals
in
its
course
by
cracks
it
was
a
continuous
but
so
to
speak
roar
on
receiving
the
snap
crusoe
gave
forth
roar
with
a
majesty
and
power
that
scattered
the
pugnacious
front
rank
of
the
enemy
to
the
winds
those
that
still
remained
half
stupified
he
leaped
over
with
a
huge
bound
and
alighted
fangs
first
on
the
back
of
the
big
dog
there
was
one
hideous
yell
a
muffled
scramble
of
an
duration
and
the
big
dog
lay
dead
upon
the
plain
it
was
an
awful
thing
to
do
but
crusoe
evidently
felt
that
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
case
required
that
an
example
should
be
made
and
to
say
truth
all
things
considered
we
can
not
blame
him
the
news
must
have
been
carried
at
once
through
the
canine
portion
of
the
camp
for
crusoe
was
never
interfered
with
again
after
that
dick
witnessed
this
little
incident
but
he
observed
that
the
indian
chief
cared
not
a
straw
about
it
and
as
his
dog
returned
quietly
and
sat
down
in
its
old
place
he
took
no
notice
of
it
either
but
continued
to
listen
to
the
explanations
which
joe
gave
to
the
chief
of
the
desire
of
the
to
be
friends
with
the
joe
eloquence
would
have
done
little
for
him
on
this
occasion
had
his
hands
been
empty
but
he
followed
it
up
by
opening
one
of
his
packs
and
displaying
the
glittering
contents
before
the
equally
glittering
eyes
of
the
chief
and
his
squaws
these
said
joe
are
the
gifts
that
the
great
chief
of
the
sends
to
the
great
chief
of
the
pawnees
and
he
bids
me
say
that
there
are
many
more
things
in
his
stores
which
will
be
traded
for
skins
with
the
when
they
visit
him
and
he
also
says
that
if
the
pawnees
will
not
steal
horses
any
more
from
the
they
shall
receive
gifts
of

and
guns
and
powder
and
blankets
every
year
wah
grunted
the
chief
it
is
good
the
great
chief
is
wise
we
will
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
the
things
that
afforded
so
much
satisfaction
to
were
the
veriest
trifles
penny
in
yellow
gilt
tin
frames
beads
of
various
colours
needles
cheap
scissors
and
knives
vermilion
paint
and
coarse
scarlet
cloth
etc
they
were
of
priceless
value
however
in
the
estimation
of
the
savages
who
delighted
to
adorn
themselves
with
leggings
made
from
the
cloth
beautifully
worked
with
beads
by
their
own
ingenious
women
they
were
thankful
too
for
knives
even
of
the
commonest
description
having
none
but
bone
ones
of
their
own
and
they
gloried
in
daubing
their
faces
with
intermingled
streaks
of
charcoal
and
vermilion
to
gaze
at
their
visages
when
thus
treated
in
the
little
penny
is
their
summit
of
delight
joe
presented
the
chief
with
a
portion
of
these
coveted
goods
and
tied
up
the
remainder
we
may
remark
here
that
the
only
thing
which
prevented
the
savages
from
taking
possession
of
the
whole
at
once
without
asking
permission
was
the
promise
of
the
annual
gifts
which
they
knew
would
not
be
forthcoming
were
any
evil
to
befall
the
deputies
of
the
nevertheless
it
cost
them
a
severe
struggle
to
restrain
their
hands
on
this
occasion
and
joe
and
his
companions
felt
that
they
would
have
to
play
their
part
well
in
order
to
fulfil
their
mission
with
safety
and
credit
the
may
go
now
and
talk
with
the
braves
said
after
carefully
examining
everything
that
was
given
to
him
a
council
will
be
called
soon
and
we
will
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
accepting
this
permission
to
retire
the
hunters
immediately
left
the
tent
and
being
now
at
liberty
to
do
what
they
pleased
they
amused
themselves
by
wandering
about
the
village
he
a
cute
chap
that
remarked
joe
with
a
sarcastic
smile
i
do
feel
quite
easy
about
gettin
away
he
bother
the
life
out
us
to
get
all
the
goods
we
got
and
ye
see
as
we
other
tribes
to
visit
we
must
give
away
as
little
as
we
can
here
ha
you
is
right
said
henri
dat
fellow
eyes
twinkle
at
de
knives
and
tings
like
two
stars
ye
should
say
stars
are
too
soft
an
beautiful
to
compare
to
the
eyes
o
yon
savage
said
dick
laughing
i
wish
we
were
well
away
from
them
that
rascal
mahtawa
is
an
ugly
customer
true
lad
returned
joe
had
bin
the
great
chief
our
scalps
had
bin
dryin
in
the
smoke
o
a
pawnee
wigwam
afore
now
what
now
lad
joe
question
was
put
in
consequence
of
a
gleeful
smile
that
overspread
the
countenance
of
dick
varley
who
replied
by
pointing
to
a
wigwam
towards
which
they
were
approaching
oh
that
only
a
dandy
exclaimed
joe
there
lots
o
them
in
every
injun
camp
they
fit
for
nothin
but
dress
poor
contemptible
critters
joe
accompanied
his
remark
with
a
sneer
for
of
all
pitiable
objects
he
regarded
an
unmanly
man
as
the
most
despicable
he
consented
however
to
sit
down
on
a
grassy
bank
and
watch
the
proceedings
of
this
indian
dandy
who
had
just
seated
himself
in
front
of
his
wigwam
for
the
purpose
of
making
his
toilet
he
began
it
by
greasing
his
whole
person
carefully
and
smoothly
over
with
buffalo
fat
until
he
shone
like
a
patent
leather
boot
then
he
rubbed
himself
almost
dry
leaving
the
skin
sleek
and
glossy
having
proceeded
thus
far
he
took
up
a
small
mirror
a
few
inches
in
diameter
which
he
or
some
other
member
of
the
tribe
must
have
procured
during
one
of
their
few
excursions
to
the
of
the
and
examined
himself
as
well
as
he
could
in
so
limited
a
space
next
he
took
a
little
vermilion
from
a
small
parcel
and
rubbed
it
over
his
face
until
it
presented
the
somewhat
demoniac
appearance
of
a
fiery
red
he
also
drew
a
broad
red
score
along
the
crown
of
his
head
which
was
closely
shaved
with
the
exception
of
the
usual
tuft
or
scalplock
on
the
top
this
scalplock
stood
bristling
straight
up
a
few
inches
and
then
curved
over
and
hung
down
his
back
about
two
feet
immense
care
and
attention
was
bestowed
on
this
lock
he
smoothed
it
greased
it
and
plaited
it
into
the
form
of
a
pigtail
another
application
was
here
made
to
the
glass
and
the
result
was
evidently
satisfactory
to
judge
from
the
beaming
smile
that
played
on
his
features
but
not
content
with
the
general
effect
he
tried
the
effect
of
expression
frowned
portentously
scowled
savagely
gaped
hideously
and
grinned
horribly
a
ghastly
smile
then
our
dandy
fitted
into
his
ears
which
were
bored
in
several
places
sundry
ornaments
such
as
rings
wampum
and
hung
several
strings
of
beads
round
his
neck
besides
these
he
affixed
one
or
two
ornaments
to
his
arms
wrists
and
ankles
and
touched
in
a
few
effects
with
vermilion
on
the
shoulders
and
breast
after
this
and
a
few
more
glances
at
the
glass
he
put
on
a
pair
of
beautiful
moccasins
which
besides
being
richly
wrought
with
beads
were
soft
as
chamois
leather
and
fitted
his
feet
like
gloves
a
pair
of
leggings
of
scarlet
cloth
were
drawn
on
attached
to
a
and
bound
below
the
knee
with
broad
garters
of
variegated
it
was
some
time
before
this
adonis
was
quite
satisfied
with
himself
he
retouched
the
paint
on
his
shoulders
several
times
and
modified
the
glare
of
that
on
his
visage
before
he
could
tear
himself
away
but
at
last
he
did
so
and
throwing
a
large
piece
of
scarlet
cloth
over
his
shoulders
he
thrust
his
under
his
belt
and
proceeded
to
mount
his
palfrey
which
was
held
in
readiness
near
to
the
tent
door
by
one
of
his
wives
the
horse
was
really
a
fine
animal
and
seemed
worthy
of
a
more
warlike
master
his
shoulders
too
were
striped
with
red
paint
and
feathers
were
intertwined
with
his
mane
and
tail
while
the
bridle
was
decorated
with
various
jingling
ornaments
vaulting
upon
his
steed
with
a
large
fan
of
wild
goose
and
turkey
feathers
in
one
hand
and
a
whip
dangling
at
the
wrist
of
the
other
this
incomparable
dandy
sallied
forth
for
a
promenade
that
being
his
chief
delight
when
there
was
no
buffalo
hunting
to
be
done
other
men
who
were
not
dandies
sharpened
their
knives
smoked
feasted
and
mended
their
spears
and
arrows
at
such
seasons
of
leisure
or
played
at
athletic
games
let
follow
my
buck
said
joe
blunt
oui
come
replied
henri
striding
after
the
rider
at
a
pace
that
almost
compelled
his
comrades
to
run
hold
on
cried
dick
laughing
we
do
want
to
keep
him
company
a
distant
view
is
quite
enough
o
sich
a
chap
as
that
mais
you
forgit
i
can
not
see
far
so
much
the
better
remarked
joe
it
my
opinion
we
seen
enough
o
him
ah
he
goin
to
look
on
at
the
games
them
worth
at
the
games
to
which
joe
referred
were
taking
place
on
a
green
level
plain
close
to
the
creek
and
a
little
above
the
waterfall
before
referred
to
some
of
the
indians
were
some
jumping
and
others
wrestling
but
the
game
which
proved
most
attractive
was
throwing
the
javelin
in
which
several
of
the
young
braves
were
engaged
this
game
is
played
by
two
competitors
each
armed
with
a
dart
in
an
arena
about
fifty
yards
long
one
of
the
players
has
a
hoop
of
six
inches
in
diameter
at
a
signal
they
start
off
on
foot
at
full
speed
and
on
reaching
the
middle
of
the
arena
the
indian
with
the
hoop
rolls
it
along
before
them
and
each
does
his
best
to
send
a
javelin
through
the
hoop
before
the
other
he
who
succeeds
counts
so
many
points
if
both
miss
the
nearest
to
the
hoop
is
allowed
to
count
but
not
so
much
as
if
he
had
ringed
it
the
indians
are
very
fond
of
this
game
and
will
play
at
it
under
a
broiling
sun
for
hours
together
but
a
good
deal
of
the
interest
attaching
to
it
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
they
make
it
a
means
of
gambling
indians
are
inveterate
gamblers
and
will
sometimes
go
on
until
they
lose
horses
bows
blankets
robes
and
in
short
their
whole
personal
property
the
consequences
are
as
might
be
expected
that
fierce
and
bloody
quarrels
sometimes
arise
in
which
life
is
often
lost
try
your
hand
at
that
said
henri
to
dick
by
all
means
cried
dick
handing
his
rifle
to
his
friend
and
springing
into
the
ring
enthusiastically
a
general
shout
of
applause
greeted
the
who
threw
off
his
coat
and
tightened
his
belt
while
a
young
indian
presented
him
with
a
dart
now
see
that
ye
do
us
credit
lad
said
joe
i
try
answered
dick
in
a
moment
they
were
off
the
young
indian
rolled
away
the
hoop
and
dick
threw
his
dart
with
such
vigour
that
it
went
deep
into
the
ground
but
missed
the
hoop
by
a
foot
at
least
the
young
first
dart
went
through
the
centre
ha
exclaimed
joe
blunt
to
the
indians
near
him
the
lad
not
used
to
that
game
try
him
at
a
race
bring
out
your
best
brave
he
whose
bound
is
like
the
hunted
deer
we
need
scarcely
remind
the
reader
that
joe
spoke
in
the
indian
language
and
that
the
above
is
a
correct
rendering
of
the
sense
of
what
he
said
the
name
of
tarwicadia
or
the
little
chief
immediately
passed
from
lip
to
lip
and
in
a
few
minutes
an
indian
a
little
below
the
medium
size
bounded
into
the
arena
with
an
elasticity
that
caused
a
shade
of
anxiety
to
pass
over
joe
face
ah
boy
he
whispered
i
afeard
you
find
him
a
tough
customer
that
just
what
i
want
replied
dick
he
supple
enough
but
he
wants
muscle
in
the
thigh
we
make
it
a
long
heat
right
lad
ye
right
joe
now
proceeded
to
arrange
the
conditions
of
the
race
with
the
chiefs
around
him
it
was
fixed
that
the
distance
to
be
run
should
be
a
mile
so
that
the
race
would
be
one
of
two
miles
out
and
back
moreover
the
competitors
were
to
run
without
any
clothes
except
a
belt
and
a
small
piece
of
cloth
round
the
loins
this
to
the
indians
was
nothing
for
they
seldom
wore
more
in
warm
weather
but
dick
would
have
preferred
to
keep
on
part
of
his
dress
the
laws
of
the
course
however
would
not
permit
of
this
so
he
stripped
and
stood
forth
the
of
a
agile
man
he
was
greatly
superior
in
size
to
his
antagonist
and
more
muscular
the
savage
being
slender
and
extremely
lithe
and
springy
ha
i
will
run
too
shouted
henri
bouncing
forward
with
clumsy
energy
and
throwing
off
his
coat
just
as
they
were
going
to
start
the
savages
smiled
at
this
unexpected
burst
and
made
no
objection
considering
the
thing
in
the
light
of
a
joke
the
signal
was
given
and
away
they
went
oh
it
would
have
done
you
good
to
have
seen
the
way
in
which
henri
manoeuvred
his
limbs
on
this
celebrated
occasion
he
went
over
the
ground
with
huge
elephantine
bounds
runs
and
jumps
he
could
not
have
been
said
to
have
one
style
of
running
he
had
a
dozen
styles
all
of
which
came
into
play
in
the
course
of
half
as
many
minutes
the
other
two
ran
like
the
wind
yet
although
henri
to
be
going
heavily
over
the
ground
he
kept
up
with
them
to
the
as
for
dick
it
became
evident
in
the
first
few
minutes
that
he
could
outstrip
his
antagonist
with
ease
and
was
hanging
back
a
little
all
the
time
he
shot
ahead
like
an
arrow
when
they
came
about
back
and
it
was
clear
that
the
real
interest
of
the
race
was
to
lie
in
the
competition
between
henri
and
tarwicadia
before
they
were
of
the
way
back
dick
walked
in
to
the
and
turned
to
watch
the
others
henri
wind
was
about
gone
for
he
exerted
himself
with
such
violence
that
he
wasted
half
his
strength
the
indian
on
the
contrary
was
comparatively
fresh
but
he
was
not
so
fleet
as
his
antagonist
whose
tremendous
strides
carried
him
over
the
ground
at
an
incredible
pace
on
they
came
neck
and
neck
till
close
on
the
score
that
marked
the
here
the
value
of
enthusiasm
came
out
strongly
in
the
case
of
henri
he
that
he
could
not
gain
an
inch
on
tarwicadia
to
save
his
life
but
just
as
he
came
up
he
observed
the
anxious
faces
of
his
comrades
and
the
countenances
of
the
savages
his
heart
thumped
against
his
ribs
every
muscle
thrilled
with
a
gush
of
conflicting
feelings
and
he
himself
over
the
score
like
a
cannon
shot
full
six
inches
ahead
of
the
little
chief
but
the
thing
did
not
by
any
means
end
here
tarwicadia
pulled
up
the
instant
he
had
passed
not
so
our
canadian
such
a
clumsy
and
colossal
frame
was
not
to
be
checked
in
a
moment
the
crowd
of
indians
opened
up
to
let
him
pass
but
unfortunately
a
small
tent
that
stood
in
the
way
was
not
so
obliging
into
it
he
went
head
foremost
like
a
shell
carried
away
the
corner
post
with
his
shoulder
and
brought
the
whole
affair
down
about
his
own
ears
and
those
of
its
inmates
among
whom
were
several
children
and
two
or
three
dogs
it
required
some
time
to
extricate
them
all
from
the
ruins
but
when
this
was
effected
it
was
found
that
no
serious
damage
had
been
done
to
life
or
limb

when

so
told
at
this
moment
there
was
a
wild
cry
of
terror
heard
a
short
distance
ahead
of
them
rushing
forward
they
observed
an
indian
woman
flying
frantically
down
the
river
bank
towards
the
waterfall
a
hundred
yards
above
which
an
object
was
seen
struggling
in
the
water

joe

in
a
few
seconds

cried
dick
pointing
to
the
child
which
had
been
caught
in
an
eddy
and
was
for
a
few
moments
hovering
on
the
edge
of
the
stream
that
rushed
impetuously
towards
the
fall
the
noble
newfoundland
did
not
require
to
be
told
what
to
do
it
seems
a
natural
instinct
in
this
sagacious
species
of
dog
to
save
man
or
beast
that
chances
to
be
struggling
in
the
water
and
many
are
the
authentic
stories
related
of
newfoundland
dogs
saving
life
in
cases
of
shipwreck
indeed
they
are
regularly
trained
to
the
work
in
some
countries
and
nobly
fearlessly
disinterestedly
do
they
discharge
their
trust
often
in
the
midst
of
appalling
dangers
crusoe
sprang
from
the
bank
with
such
impetus
that
his
broad
chest
ploughed
up
the
water
like
the
bow
of
a
boat
and
the
energetic
workings
of
his
muscles
were
indicated
by
the
force
of
each
successive
propulsion
as
he
shot
ahead
in
a
few
seconds
he
reached
the
child
and
caught
it
by
the
hair
then
he
turned
to
swim
back
but
the
stream
had
got
hold
of
him
bravely
he
struggled
and
lifted
the
child
out
of
the
water
in
his
powerful
efforts
to
stem
the
current
in
vain
each
moment
he
was
carried
inch
by
inch
down
until
he
was
on
the
brink
of
the
fall
which
though
not
high
was
a
large
body
of
water
and
fell
with
a
heavy
roar
he
raised
himself
high
out
of
the
stream
with
the
vigour
of
his
last
struggle
and
then
fell
back
into
the
abyss
by
this
time
the
poor
mother
was
in
a
canoe
as
close
to
the
fall
as
she
could
with
safety
approach
and
the
little
bark
danced
like
a
on
the
turmoil
of
waters
as
she
stood
with
uplifted
paddle
and
staring
eyeballs
awaiting
the
rising
of
the
child
crusoe
came
up
almost
instantly
but
for
the
dash
over
the
fall
had
wrenched
the
child
from
his
teeth
he
raised
himself
high
up
and
looked
anxiously
round
for
a
moment
then
he
caught
sight
of
a
little
hand
raised
above
the
boiling
flood
in
one
moment
he
had
the
child
again
by
the
hair
and
just
as
the
prow
of
the
indian
canoe
touched
the
shore
he
brought
the
child
to
land
springing
towards
him
the
mother
snatched
her
child
from
the
flood
and
gazed
at
its
face
with
eyeballs
starting
from
their
sockets
then
she
laid
her
cheek
on
its
cold
breast
and
stood
like
a
statue
of
despair
there
was
one
slight
pulsation
of
the
heart
and
a
gentle
motion
of
the
hand
the
child
still
lived
opening
up
her
blanket
she
laid
her
little
one
against
her
naked
warm
bosom
drew
the
covering
close
around
it
and
sitting
down
on
the
bank
wept
aloud
for
joy
come
come
quick
cried
henri
hurrying
off
to
hide
the
emotion
which
he
could
not
crush
down
ay
she
do
need
our
help
now
said
joe
following
his
comrade
as
for
crusoe
he
walked
along
by
his
master
side
with
his
usual
quiet
serene
look
of
towards
all
mankind
doubtless
a
feeling
of
gladness
at
having
saved
a
human
life
filled
his
shaggy
breast
for
he
wagged
his
tail
gently
after
each
shake
of
his
dripping
sides
but
his
meek
eyes
were
downcast
save
when
raised
to
receive
the
welcome
and
unusually
fervent
caress
crusoe
did
not
know
that
those
three
men
loved
him
as
though
he
had
been
a
brother
on
their
way
back
to
the
village
the
hunters
were
met
by
a
little
boy
who
said
that
a
council
was
to
be
held
immediately
and
their
presence
was
requested
the
council
was
held
in
the
tent
of
the
principal
chief
towards
which
all
the
other
chiefs
and
many
of
the
noted
braves
hurried
like
all
indian
councils
it
was
preceded
by
smoking
the
medicine
pipe
and
was
followed
by
speeches
from
several
of
the
best
orators
the
substance
of
the
discourse
differed
little
from
what
has
been
already
related
in
reference
to
the
treaty
between
the
and
upon
the
whole
it
was
satisfactory
but
joe
blunt
could
not
fail
to
notice
that
mahtawa
maintained
sullen
silence
during
the
whole
course
of
the
meeting
he
observed
also
that
there
was
a
considerable
change
in
the
tone
of
the
meeting
when
he
informed
them
that
he
was
bound
on
a
similar
errand
of
peace
to
several
of
the
other
tribes
especially
to
one
or
two
tribes
which
were
the
pawnees
bitter
enemies
at
that
time
these
grasping
savages
having
quite
made
up
their
minds
that
they
were
to
obtain
the
entire
contents
of
the
two
bales
of
goods
were
much
mortified
on
hearing
that
part
was
to
go
to
other
indian
tribes
some
of
them
even
hinted
that
this
would
not
be
allowed
and
joe
feared
at
one
time
that
things
were
going
to
take
an
unfavourable
turn
the
hair
of
his
scalp
as
he
afterwards
said
began
to
lift
a
little
and
feel
oneasy
but
stood
honestly
to
his
word
said
that
it
would
be
well
that
the
and
the
pawnees
should
be
brothers
and
hoped
that
they
would
not
forget
the
promise
of
annual
presents
from
the
hand
of
the
great
chief
who
lived
in
the
big
village
near
the
rising
sun
having
settled
this
matter
amicably
joe
distributed
among
the
indians
the
proportion
of
his
goods
designed
for
them
and
then
they
all
adjourned
to
another
tent
where
a
great
feast
was
prepared
for
them
are
ye
hungry
inquired
joe
of
dick
as
they
walked
along
ay
that
am
i
feel
as
if
i
could
eat
a
buffalo
alive
why
it
my
we
tasted
nothin
since
mornin
well
i
often
told
ye
that
them
redskins
think
it
a
disgrace
to
give
in
eatin
till
all
that
set
before
them
at
a
feast
is
bolted
we
ha
to
stretch
oursel
we
will
got
a
plenty
room
remarked
henri
ye
have
but
ye
wish
ye
had
more
in
a
little
bien
i
not
care
in
quarter
of
an
hour
all
the
guests
invited
to
this
great
medicine
feast
were
assembled
no
women
were
admitted
they
never
are
at
indian
feasts
we
may
remark
in
passing
that
the
word
medicine
as
used
among
the
north
american
indians
has
a
very
much
wider
signification
than
it
has
with
us
it
is
an
almost
inexplicable
word
when
asked
they
can
not
give
a
full
or
satisfactory
explanation
of
it
themselves
in
the
general
we
may
say
that
whatever
is
mysterious
is
medicine
jugglery
and
conjuring
of
a
noisy
mysterious
and
we
must
add
rather
silly
nature
is
medicine
and
the
juggler
is
a
medicine
man
these
medicine
men
undertake
cures
but
they
are
regular
charlatans
and
know
nothing
whatever
of
the
diseases
they
pretend
to
cure
or
their
remedies
they
carry
bags
containing
sundry
relics
these
are
medicine
bags
every
brave
has
his
own
private
medicine
bag
everything
that
is
incomprehensible
or
supposed
to
be
supernatural
religious
or
medical
is
medicine
this
feast
being
an
unusual
one
in
honour
of
strangers
and
in
connection
with
a
peculiar
and
unexpected
event
was
medicine
even
crusoe
since
his
gallant
conduct
in
saving
the
indian
child
was
medicine
and
dick
varley
rifle
which
had
been
an
object
of
wonder
ever
since
his
arrival
at
the
village
was
tremendous
medicine
of
course
the
indians
were
arrayed
in
their
best
several
wore
necklaces
of
the
claws
of
the
grizzly
bear
of
which
they
are
extremely
proud
and
a
gaudily
picturesque
group
they
were
the
chief
however
had
undergone
a
transformation
that
upset
the
gravity
of
our
hunters
and
rendered
dick
efforts
to
look
solemn
quite
abortive
had
once
been
to
the
of
the
and
while
there
had
received
the
customary
gift
of
a
blue
surtout
with
brass
buttons
and
an
ordinary
hat
such
as
gentlemen
wear
at
home
as
the
coat
was
a
good
deal
too
small
for
him
a
terrible
length
of
dark
bony
wrist
appeared
below
the
cuffs
the
waist
was
too
high
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
he
managed
to
button
the
garment
across
his
broad
chest
being
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
a
hat
the
worthy
savage
had
allowed
the
paper
and
string
with
which
it
had
been
originally
covered
to
remain
on
supposing
them
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
the
hat
and
this
together
with
the
high
collar
of
the
coat
which
gave
him
a
appearance
the
long
black
naked
legs
and
the
painted
visage
gave
to
him
a
which
we
can
compare
to
nothing
as
there
was
nothing
in
nature
comparable
to
it
those
guests
who
assembled
first
passed
their
time
in
smoking
the
medicine
pipe
until
the
others
should
arrive
for
so
long
as
a
single
invited
guest
is
absent
the
feast
can
not
begin
dignified
silence
was
maintained
while
the
pipe
thus
circulated
from
hand
to
hand
when
the
last
guest
arrived
they
began
the
men
were
seated
in
two
rows
face
to
face
feasts
of
this
kind
usually
consist
of
but
one
species
of
food
and
on
the
present
occasion
it
was
an
enormous
caldron
full
of
maize
which
had
to
be
devoured
about
fifty
sat
down
to
eat
a
quantity
of
what
may
be
termed
thick
porridge
that
would
have
been
ample
allowance
for
a
hundred
ordinary
men
before
commencing
desired
an
aged
medicine
man
to
make
an
oration
which
he
did
fluently
and
poetically
its
subject
was
the
praise
of
the
giver
of
the
feast
at
the
end
of
each
period
there
was
a
general
hou
hou
of
assent
equivalent
to
the
hear
hear
of
civilized
men
other
orators
then
followed
all
of
whom
spoke
with
great
ease
and
fluency
and
some
in
the
most
impassioned
strains
working
themselves
and
their
audience
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
now
shouting
with
frenzied
violence
till
their
eyes
glared
from
their
sockets
and
the
veins
of
their
foreheads
swelled
almost
to
bursting
as
they
spoke
of
war
and
chase
anon
breaking
into
soft
modulated
and
pleasing
tones
while
they
dilated
upon
the
pleasures
of
peace
and
hospitality
after
these
had
finished
a
number
of
wooden
bowls
full
of
maize
porridge
were
put
down
between
the
guests
one
bowl
to
each
couple
facing
each
other
but
before
commencing
a
portion
was
laid
aside
and
dedicated
to
their
gods
with
various
mysterious
ceremonies
for
here
as
in
other
places
where
the
gospel
is
not
known
the
poor
savages
fancied
that
they
could
propitiate
god
with
sacrifices
they
had
never
heard
of
the
sacrifice
of
a
broken
spirit
and
a
contrite
heart
this
offering
being
made
the
feast
began
in
earnest
not
only
was
it
a
rule
in
this
feast
that
every
mouthful
should
be
swallowed
by
each
guest
however
unwilling
and
unable
he
should
be
to
do
so
but
he
who
could
dispose
of
it
with
greatest
speed
was
deemed
the
greatest
man
at
least
on
that
occasion
while
the
last
to
conclude
his
supper
was
looked
upon
with
some
degree
of
contempt
it
seems
strange
that
such
a
custom
should
ever
have
arisen
and
one
is
not
a
little
puzzled
in
endeavouring
to
guess
at
the
origin
of
it
there
is
one
fact
that
occurs
to
us
as
the
probable
cause
the
indian
is
as
we
have
before
hinted
frequently
reduced
to
a
state
bordering
on
starvation
and
in
a
day
after
he
may
be
burdened
with
superabundance
of
food
he
oftentimes
therefore
eats
as
much
as
he
can
stuff
into
his
body
when
he
is
blessed
with
plenty
so
as
to
be
the
better
able
to
withstand
the
attacks
of
hunger
that
may
possibly
be
in
store
for
him
the
amount
that
an
indian
will
thus
eat
at
a
single
meal
is
incredible
he
seems
to
have
the
power
of
distending
himself
for
the
reception
of
a
quantity
that
would
kill
a
civilized
man
children
in
particular
become
like
tightly
inflated
little
balloons
after
a
feast
and
as
they
wear
no
clothing
the
extraordinary
rotundity
is
very
obvious
not
to
say
ridiculous
we
conclude
therefore
that
unusual
powers
of
gormandizing
being
useful
come
at
last
to
be
cultivated
as
praiseworthy
by
good
fortune
dick
and
joe
blunt
happened
to
have
such
enormous
gluttons
as
that
the
portions
of
their
respective
bowls
which
they
could
not
devour
were
gobbled
up
for
them
by
good
capacity
and
digestion
with
no
small
amount
of
effort
henri
managed
to
dispose
of
his
own
share
but
he
was
last
of
being
done
and
fell
in
the
savages
esteem
greatly
the
way
in
which
that
sticky
compost
of
boiled
maize
went
down
was
absolutely
amazing
the
man
opposite
dick
in
particular
was
a
human
he
suffocated
dick
with
suppressed
laughter
he
was
a
great
savage
with
a
throat
of
indiarubber
and
went
quickly
and
quietly
on
swallowing
mass
after
mass
with
the
solemn
gravity
of
an
owl
it
mattered
not
a
straw
to
him
that
dick
took
comparatively
small
mouthfuls
and
nearly
choked
on
them
too
for
want
of
liquid
to
wash
them
down
had
dick
eaten
none
at
all
he
would
have
uncomplainingly
disposed
of
the
whole
jack
the
feats
were
nothing
to
his
and
when
at
last
the
bowl
was
empty
he
stopped
short
like
a
machine
from
which
the
steam
had
been
suddenly
cut
off
and
laid
down
his
buffalo
a
sigh
dick
sighed
though
with
relief
and
gratitude
when
his
bowl
was
empty
i
hope
i
may
never
have
to
do
it
again
said
joe
that
night
as
they
wended
their
way
back
to
the
chief
tent
after
supper
i
would
be
fit
for
anything
for
a
week
arter
it
dick
could
only
laugh
for
any
allusion
to
the
feast
instantly
brought
back
that
gourmand
to
whom
he
was
so
deeply
indebted
henri
groaned
oh
mes
boy
i
am
speechless
i
am
ready
for
bust
oui
hah
i
veesh
it
vas
many
a
time
that
night
did
henri
veesh
it
vas
as
he
lay
helpless
on
his
back
looking
up
through
the
roof
of
the
chief
tent
at
the
stars
and
listening
enviously
to
the
plethoric
snoring
of
joe
blunt
he
was
entertained
however
during
those
waking
hours
with
a
serenade
such
as
few
civilized
ears
ever
listen
to
this
was
nothing
else
than
a
vocal
concert
performed
by
all
the
dogs
of
the
village
and
as
they
amounted
to
nearly
two
thousand
the
orchestra
was
a
pretty
full
one
these
wretches
howled
as
if
they
had
all
gone
mad
yet
there
was
method
in
their
madness
for
they
congregated
in
a
crowd
before
beginning
and
sat
down
on
their
haunches
then
one
which
seemed
to
be
the
conductor
raised
his
snout
to
the
sky
and
uttered
a
long
low
melancholy
wail
the
others
took
it
up
by
twos
and
threes
until
the
whole
pack
had
their
noses
pointing
to
the
stars
and
their
throats
distended
to
the
uttermost
while
a
prolonged
yell
filled
the
air
then
it
sank
gradually
one
or
two
bad
performers
probably
making
a
yelping
attempt
to
get
it
up
again
at
the
wrong
time
again
the
conductor
raised
his
nose
and
out
it
came
full
swing
there
was
no
vociferous
barking
it
was
simple
wolfish
howling
increased
in
fervour
to
an
electric
yell
with
slight
barks
running
continuously
through
it
like
an
obbligato
accompaniment
when
crusoe
first
heard
the
unwonted
sound
he
sprang
to
his
feet
bristled
up
like
a
hyena
showed
all
his
teeth
and
bounded
out
of
the
tent
blazing
with
indignation
and
astonishment
when
he
found
out
what
it
was
he
returned
quite
sleek
and
with
a
look
of
profound
contempt
on
his
countenance
as
he
resumed
his
place
by
his
master
side
and
went
to
sleep

dick
varley
sat
before
the
fire
ruminating
we
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
dick
had
been
previously
eating
grass
by
no
means
for
several
days
past
he
had
been
mentally
subsisting
on
the
remarkable
things
that
he
heard
and
saw
in
the
pawnee
village
and
wondering
how
he
was
to
get
away
without
being
scalped
he
was
now
chewing
the
cud
of
this
intellectual
fare
we
therefore
repeat
emphatically
in
case
any
reader
should
have
presumed
to
contradict
us
that

sat
before

joe

likewise
sat
by

along
with

look
o
things
said
joe
blowing
a
whiff
of
smoke
slowly
from
his
lips
and
watching
it
as
it
ascended
into
the
still
air
that
blackguard
mahtawa
is
determined
not
to
let
us
off
till
he
gits
all
our
goods
an
if
he
gits
them
he
may
as
well
take
our
scalps
too
for
we
would
come
poor
speed
in
the
prairies
without
guns
horses
or
goods
dick
looked
at
his
friend
with
an
expression
of
concern
what
to
be
done
said
he
ve
must
escape
answered
henri
but
his
tone
was
not
a
hopeful
one
for
he
knew
the
danger
of
their
position
better
than
dick
ay
we
must
escape
at
least
we
must
try
said
joe
but
i
make
one
more
effort
to
smooth
over
an
git
him
to
snub
that
villain
mahtawa
just
as
he
spoke
the
villain
in
question
entered
the
tent
with
a
bold
haughty
air
and
sat
down
before
the
fire
in
sullen
silence
for
some
minutes
no
one
spoke
and
henri
who
happened
at
the
time
to
be
examining
the
locks
of
dick
rifle
continued
to
inspect
them
with
an
appearance
of
careless
indifference
that
he
was
far
from
feeling
now
this
rifle
of
dick
had
become
a
source
of
unceasing
wonder
to
the
indians
wonder
which
was
greatly
increased
by
the
fact
that
no
one
could
discharge
it
but
himself
dick
had
during
his
short
stay
at
the
pawnee
village
amused
himself
and
the
savages
by
exhibiting
his
marvellous
powers
with
the
silver
rifle
since
it
had
been
won
by
him
at
the
memorable
match
in
the
mustang
valley
it
had
scarce
ever
been
out
of
his
hand
so
that
he
had
become
decidedly
the
best
shot
in
the
settlement
could
bark
squirrels
that
is
hit
the
bark
of
the
branch
on
which
a
squirrel
happened
to
be
standing
and
so
kill
it
by
the
concussion
alone
and
could
drive
the
nail
every
shot
the
silver
rifle
as
we
have
said
became
great
medicine
to
the
when
they
saw
it
kill
at
a
distance
which
the
few
wretched
guns
they
had
obtained
from
the
could
not
even
send
a
spent
ball
to
the
double
shot
too
filled
them
with
wonder
and
admiration
but
that
which
they
regarded
with
an
almost
supernatural
feeling
of
curiosity
was
the
percussion
cap
which
in
dick
hands
always
exploded
but
in
theirs
was
utterly
useless
this
result
was
simply
owing
to
the
fact
that
dick
after
firing
handed
the
rifle
to
the
indians
without
renewing
the
cap
so
that
when
they
loaded
and
attempted
to
fire
of
course
it
merely
snapped
when
he
wished
again
to
fire
he
adroitly
exchanged
the
old
cap
for
a
new
one
he
was
immensely
tickled
by
the
solemn
looks
of
the
indians
at
this
most
incomprehensible
of
all
medicines
and
kept
them
for
some
days
in
ignorance
of
the
true
cause
intending
to
reveal
it
before
he
left
but
circumstances
now
arose
which
banished
all
trifling
thoughts
from
his
mind
mahtawa
raised
his
head
suddenly
and
said
pointing
to
the
silver
rifle
mahtawa
wishes
to
have
the
medicine
gun
he
will
give
his
best
horse
in
exchange
mahtawa
is
liberal
answered
joe
but
the
youth
can
not
part
with
it
he
has
far
to
travel
and
must
shoot
buffaloes
by
the
way
the
youth
shall
have
a
bow
and
arrows
to
shoot
the
buffalo
rejoined
the
indian
he
can
not
use
the
bow
and
arrow
answered
joe
he
has
not
been
trained
like
the
mahtawa
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
and
his
dark
brows
frowned
more
heavily
than
ever
over
his
eyes
the
are
too
bold
he
exclaimed
working
himself
into
a
passion
they
are
in
the
power
of
mahtawa
if
they
will
not
give
the
gun
he
will
take
it
he
sprang
suddenly
to
his
feet
as
he
spoke
and
snatched
the
rifle
from
henri
hand
henri
being
ignorant
of
the
language
had
not
been
able
to
understand
the
foregoing
conversation
although
he
saw
well
enough
that
it
was
not
an
agreeable
one
but
no
sooner
did
he
find
himself
thus
rudely
and
unexpectedly
deprived
of
the
rifle
than
he
jumped
up
wrenched
it
in
a
twinkling
from
the
indian
grasp
and
hurled
him
violently
out
of
the
tent
in
a
moment
mahtawa
drew
his
knife
uttered
a
savage
yell
and
sprang
on
the
reckless
hunter
who
however
caught
his
wrist
and
held
it
as
if
in
a
vice
the
yell
brought
a
dozen
warriors
instantly
to
the
spot
and
before
dick
had
time
to
recover
from
his
astonishment
henri
was
surrounded
and
pinioned
despite
his
herculean
struggles
before
dick
could
move
joe
blunt
grasped
his
arm
and
whispered
quickly
do
rise
you
ca
help
him
they
dare
kill
him
till
agrees
though
much
surprised
dick
obeyed
but
it
required
all
his
efforts
both
of
voice
and
hand
to
control
crusoe
whose
mind
was
much
too
honest
and
straightforward
to
understand
such
subtle
pieces
of
diplomacy
and
who
strove
to
rush
to
the
rescue
of
his
friend
when
the
tumult
had
partly
subsided
joe
blunt
rose
and
said
have
the
pawnee
braves
turned
traitors
that
they
draw
the
knife
against
those
who
have
smoked
with
them
the
pipe
of
peace
and
eaten
their
maize
the
are
three
the
pawnees
are
thousands
if
evil
has
been
done
let
it
be
laid
before
the
chief
mahtawa
wishes
to
have
the
medicine
gun
although
we
said
no
we
could
not
part
with
it
he
tried
to
take
it
by
force
are
we
to
go
back
to
the
great
chief
of
the
and
say
that
the
pawnees
are
thieves
are
the
henceforth
to
tell
their
children
when
they
steal
is
bad
that
is
like
the
pawnee
no
this
must
not
be
the
rifle
shall
be
restored
and
we
will
forget
this
disagreement
is
it
not
so
there
was
an
evident
disposition
on
the
part
of
many
of
the
indians
with
whom
mahtawa
was
no
favourite
to
applaud
this
speech
but
the
wily
chief
sprang
forward
and
with
flashing
eyes
sought
to
turn
the
tables
the
speaks
with
soft
words
but
his
heart
is
false
is
he
not
going
to
make
peace
with
the
enemies
of
the
pawnee
is
he
not
going
to
take
goods
to
them
and
make
them
gifts
and
promises
the
are
spies
they
come
to
see
the
weakness
of
the
pawnee
camp
but
they
have
found
that
it
is
strong
shall
we
suffer
the
false
hearts
to
escape
shall
they
live
no
we
will
hang
their
scalps
in
our
wigwams
for
they
have
a
and
we
will
keep
all
their
goods
for
our
squaws
wah
this
allusion
to
keeping
all
the
goods
had
more
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
vacillating
savages
than
the
chief
eloquence
but
a
new
turn
was
given
to
their
thoughts
by
joe
blunt
remarking
in
a
quiet
almost
contemptuous
tone
mahtawa
is
not
the
chief
true
true
they
cried
and
immediately
hurried
to
the
tent
of
once
again
this
chief
stood
between
the
hunters
and
the
savages
who
wanted
but
a
signal
to
fall
on
them
there
was
a
long
palaver
which
ended
in
henri
being
set
at
liberty
and
the
rifle
being
restored
that
evening
as
the
three
friends
sat
beside
their
fire
eating
their
supper
of
boiled
maize
and
buffalo
meat
they
laughed
and
talked
as
carelessly
as
ever
but
the
gaiety
was
assumed
for
they
were
at
the
time
planning
their
escape
from
a
tribe
which
they
foresaw
would
not
long
refrain
from
carrying
out
their
wishes
and
robbing
perhaps
murdering
them
ye
see
said
joe
with
a
perplexed
air
while
he
drew
a
piece
of
live
charcoal
from
the
fire
with
his
fingers
and
lighted
his
pipe
ye
see
there
more
difficulties
in
the
way
o
gettin
off
than
ye
think
oh
nivare
mind
de
difficulties
interrupted
henri
whose
wrath
at
the
treatment
he
had
received
had
not
yet
cooled
down
ve
must
jump
on
de
best
horses
ve
can
git
hold
shake
our
fists
at
de
red
reptiles
and
go
away
fast
as
ve
can
de
best
hoss
vin
de
race
joe
shook
his
head
a
hundred
arrows
would
be
in
our
backs
before
we
got
twenty
yards
from
the
camp
besides
we
ca
tell
which
are
the
best
horses
our
own
are
the
best
in
my
but
how
are
we
to
git
em
i
know
who
has
charge
o
them
said
dick
i
saw
them
grazing
near
the
tent
o
that
poor
squaw
whose
baby
was
saved
by
crusoe
either
her
husband
looks
after
them
or
some
neighbours
that
well
said
joe
that
one
o
my
difficulties
gone
what
are
the
others
well
d
see
they
troublesome
we
ca
git
the
horses
out
camp
without
bein
seen
for
the
red
rascals
would
see
what
we
were
at
in
a
jiffy
then
if
we
do
git
out
we
ca
go
off
without
our
bales
an
we
need
think
to
take
from
under
the
nose
o
the
chief
and
his
squaws
without
bein
axed
questions
to
go
off
without
them
would
niver
do
at
all
joe
said
dick
earnestly
i
hit
on
a
plan
have
ye
dick
what
come
and
i
let
ye
see
answered
dick
rising
hastily
and
quitting
the
tent
followed
by
his
comrades
and
his
faithful
dog
it
may
be
as
well
to
remark
here
that
no
restraint
whatever
had
yet
been
put
on
the
movements
of
our
hunters
as
long
as
they
kept
to
their
legs
for
it
was
well
known
that
any
attempt
by
men
on
foot
to
escape
from
mounted
indians
on
the
plains
would
be
hopeless
moreover
the
savages
thought
that
as
long
as
there
was
a
prospect
of
their
being
allowed
to
depart
peaceably
with
their
goods
they
would
not
be
so
mad
as
to
fly
from
the
camp
and
by
so
doing
risk
their
lives
and
declare
war
with
their
entertainers
they
had
therefore
been
permitted
to
wander
unchecked
as
yet
far
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
and
amuse
themselves
in
paddling
about
the
lake
in
the
small
indian
canoes
and
shooting
dick
now
led
the
way
through
the
labyrinths
of
tents
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
and
they
talked
and
laughed
loudly
and
whistled
to
crusoe
as
they
went
in
order
to
prevent
their
purpose
being
suspected
for
the
purpose
of
further
disarming
suspicion
they
went
without
their
rifles
dick
explained
his
plan
by
the
way
and
it
was
at
once
warmly
approved
of
by
his
comrades
on
reaching
the
lake
they
launched
a
small
canoe
into
which
crusoe
was
ordered
to
jump
then
embarking
they
paddled
swiftly
to
the
opposite
shore
singing
a
canoe
song
as
they
dipped
their
paddles
in
the
moonlit
waters
of
the
lake
arrived
at
the
other
side
they
hauled
the
canoe
up
and
hurried
through
the
thin
belt
of
wood
and
willows
that
intervened
between
the
lake
and
the
prairie
here
they
paused
is
that
the
bluff
joe
no
dick
that
too
near
one
be
best
far
away
to
the
right
it
a
little
one
and
there
others
near
it
the
sharp
eyes
o
the
redskins
wo
be
so
likely
to
be
prowlin
there
come
on
then
but
we
have
to
take
down
by
the
lake
first
in
a
few
minutes
the
hunters
were
threading
their
way
through
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
at
a
rapid
trot
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
bluff
or
wooded
knoll
which
they
wished
to
reach
this
they
did
lest
prying
eyes
should
have
followed
them
in
quarter
of
an
hour
they
turned
at
right
angles
to
their
track
and
struck
straight
out
into
the
prairie
and
after
a
long
run
they
edged
round
and
came
in
upon
the
bluff
from
behind
it
was
merely
a
collection
of
stunted
but
willows
forcing
their
way
into
the
centre
of
this
they
began
to
examine
it
it
do
said
joe
de
very
ting
remarked
henri
come
here
crusoe
crusoe
bounded
to
his
master
side
and
looked
up
in
his
face
look
at
this
place
pup
smell
it
well
crusoe
instantly
set
off
all
round
among
the
willows
in
and
out
snuffing
everywhere
and
whining
with
excitement
come
here
good
pup
that
will
do
now
lads
we
go
back
so
saying
dick
and
his
friends
left
the
bluff
and
retraced
their
steps
to
the
camp
before
they
had
gone
far
however
joe
halted
and
said
d
know
dick
i
doubt
if
the
pup
so
cliver
as
ye
think
what
if
he
do
quite
onderstand
ye
dick
replied
by
taking
off
his
cap
and
throwing
it
down
at
the
same
time
exclaiming
take
it
yonder
pup
and
pointing
with
his
hand
towards
the
bluff
the
dog
seized
the
cap
and
went
off
with
it
at
full
speed
towards
the
willows
where
it
left
it
and
came
galloping
back
for
the
expected
reward
not
now
as
in
days
of
old
a
bit
of
meat
but
a
gentle
stroke
of
its
head
and
a
hearty
clap
on
its
shaggy
side
good
pup
go
now
an
fetch
it
away
he
went
with
a
bound
and
in
a
few
seconds
came
back
and
deposited
the
cap
at
his
master
feet
will
that
do
asked
dick
triumphantly
ay
lad
it
will
the
pup
worth
its
weight
in
goold
oui
i
have
said
and
i
say
it
agen
de
dog
is
so
him
is
if
not
fat
am
he
without
pausing
to
reply
to
this
perplexing
question
dick
stepped
forward
again
and
in
or
so
they
were
back
in
the
camp
now
for
part
of
the
work
joe
yonder
the
squaw
that
owns
the
baby
everything
depends
on
her
dick
pointed
to
the
indian
woman
as
he
spoke
she
was
sitting
beside
her
tent
and
playing
at
her
knee
was
the
identical
youngster
who
had
been
saved
by
crusoe
i
manage
it
said
joe
and
walked
towards
her
while
dick
and
henri
returned
to
the
chief
tent
does
the
pawnee
woman
thank
the
great
spirit
that
her
child
is
saved
began
joe
as
he
came
up
she
does
answered
the
woman
looking
up
at
the
hunter
and
her
heart
is
warm
to
the
after
a
short
silence
joe
continued
the
pawnee
chiefs
do
not
love
the
some
of
them
hate
them
the
dark
flower
knows
it
answered
the
woman
she
is
sorry
she
would
help
the
if
she
could
this
was
uttered
in
a
low
tone
and
with
a
meaning
glance
of
the
eye
joe
hesitated
again
could
he
trust
her
yes
the
feelings
that
filled
her
breast
and
prompted
her
words
were
not
those
of
the
indian
just
now
they
were
those
of
a
whose
gratitude
was
too
full
for
utterance
will
the
dark
flower
said
joe
catching
the
name
she
had
given
herself
help
the
if
he
opens
his
heart
to
her
will
she
risk
the
anger
of
her
nation
she
will
replied
the
woman
she
will
do
what
she
can
joe
and
his
dark
friend
now
dropped
their
style
of
speech
and
spoke
for
some
minutes
rapidly
in
an
undertone
it
was
finally
arranged
that
on
a
given
day
at
a
certain
hour
the
woman
should
take
the
four
horses
down
the
shores
of
the
lake
to
its
lower
end
as
if
she
were
going
for
firewood
there
cross
the
creek
at
the
ford
and
drive
them
to
the
willow
bluff
and
guard
them
till
the
hunters
should
arrive
having
settled
this
joe
returned
to
the
tent
and
informed
his
comrades
of
his
success
during
the
next
three
days
joe
kept
the
indians
in
by
giving
them
one
or
two
trinkets
and
speaking
in
glowing
terms
of
the
riches
of
the
white
men
and
the
readiness
with
which
they
would
part
with
them
to
the
savages
if
they
would
only
make
peace
meanwhile
during
the
dark
hours
of
each
night
dick
managed
to
abstract
small
quantities
of
goods
from
their
pack
in
room
of
which
he
stuffed
in
pieces
of
leather
to
keep
up
the
size
and
appearance
the
goods
thus
taken
out
he
concealed
about
his
person
and
went
off
with
a
careless
swagger
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
with
crusoe
at
his
heels
arrived
there
he
tied
the
goods
in
a
small
piece
of
deerskin
and
gave
the
bundle
to
the
dog
with
the
injunction
take
it
yonder
pup
crusoe
took
it
up
at
once
darted
off
at
full
speed
with
the
bundle
in
his
mouth
down
the
shore
of
the
lake
towards
the
ford
of
the
river
and
was
soon
lost
to
view
in
this
way
little
by
little
the
goods
were
conveyed
by
the
faithful
dog
to
the
willow
bluff
and
left
there
while
the
stuffed
pack
still
remained
in
safe
keeping
in
the
chiefs
tent
joe
did
not
at
first
like
the
idea
of
thus
sneaking
off
from
the
camp
and
more
than
once
made
strong
efforts
to
induce
to
let
him
go
but
even
that
chief
countenance
was
not
so
favourable
as
it
had
been
it
was
clear
that
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
let
slip
so
good
a
chance
of
obtaining
guns
powder
and
shot
horses
and
goods
without
any
trouble
so
joe
made
up
his
mind
to
give
them
the
slip
at
once
a
dark
night
was
chosen
for
the
attempt
and
the
indian
woman
went
off
with
the
horses
to
the
place
where
firewood
for
the
camp
was
usually
cut
unfortunately
the
suspicion
of
that
wily
savage
mahtawa
had
been
awakened
and
he
stuck
close
to
the
hunters
all
day
not
knowing
what
was
going
on
but
feeling
convinced
that
something
was
brewing
which
he
resolved
to
watch
without
mentioning
his
suspicions
to
any
one
i
think
that
villain
away
at
last
whispered
joe
to
his
comrades
it
time
to
go
lads
the
moon
wo
be
up
for
an
hour
come
along
have
ye
got
the
big
joe
ay
ay
all
right
stop
stop
my
knife
my
couteau
ah
here
i
be
now
boy
the
three
set
off
as
usual
strolling
carelessly
to
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
then
they
quickened
their
pace
and
gaining
the
lake
pushed
off
in
a
small
canoe
at
the
same
moment
mahtawa
stepped
from
the
bushes
leaped
into
another
canoe
and
followed
them
ha
he
must
die
muttered
henri
not
at
all
said
joe
we
manage
him
without
that
the
chief
landed
and
strode
boldly
up
to
them
for
he
knew
well
that
whatever
their
purpose
might
be
they
would
not
venture
to
use
their
rifles
within
sound
of
the
camp
at
that
hour
of
the
night
as
for
their
knives
he
could
trust
to
his
own
active
limbs
and
the
woods
to
escape
and
give
the
alarm
if
need
be
the
hunt
very
late
he
said
with
a
malicious
grin
do
they
love
the
dark
better
than
the
sunshine
not
so
replied
joe
coolly
but
we
love
to
walk
by
the
light
of
the
moon
it
will
be
up
in
less
than
an
hour
and
we
mean
to
take
a
long
ramble
the
pawnee
chief
loves
to
walk
by
the
moon
too
he
will
go
with
the
good
ejaculated
joe
come
along
then
the
party
immediately
set
forward
although
the
savage
was
a
little
taken
by
surprise
at
the
indifferent
way
in
which
joe
received
his
proposal
to
accompany
them
he
walked
on
to
the
edge
of
the
prairie
however
and
then
stopped
the
must
go
alone
said
he
mahtawa
will
return
to
his
tent
joe
replied
to
this
intimation
by
seizing
him
suddenly
by
the
throat
and
choking
back
the
yell
that
would
otherwise
have
brought
the
pawnee
warriors
rushing
to
the
scene
of
action
in
hundreds
mahtawa
hand
was
on
the
handle
of
his
in
a
moment
but
before
he
could
draw
it
his
arms
were
glued
to
his
sides
by
the
embrace
of
henri
while
dick
tied
a
handkerchief
quickly
yet
firmly
round
his
mouth
the
whole
thing
was
accomplished
in
two
minutes
after
taking
his
knife
and
tomahawk
away
they
loosened
their
gripe
and
escorted
him
swiftly
over
the
prairie
mahtawa
was
perfectly
submissive
after
the
first
convulsive
struggle
was
over
he
knew
that
the
men
who
walked
on
each
side
of
him
grasping
his
arms
were
more
than
his
match
singly
so
he
wisely
made
no
resistance
hurrying
him
to
a
clump
of
small
trees
on
the
plain
which
was
so
far
distant
from
the
village
that
a
yell
could
not
be
heard
they
removed
the
bandage
from
mahtawa
mouth
he
be
kill
inquired
henri
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
not
at
all
answered
joe
we
tie
him
to
a
tree
and
leave
him
here
then
he
vill
be
starve
to
deat
oh
dat
is
more
horrobell
he
must
take
his
chance
o
that
i
no
doubt
his
friends
find
him
in
a
day
or
two
an
he
game
to
last
for
a
week
or
more
but
you
have
to
run
to
the
willow
bluff
dick
and
bring
a
bit
of
line
to
tie
him
we
ca
spare
it
well
but
there
no
help
but
there
help
retorted
dick
just
order
the
villain
to
climb
into
that
tree
why
so
lad
do
ask
questions
but
do
what
i
bid
ye
the
hunter
smiled
for
a
moment
as
he
turned
to
the
indian
and
ordered
him
to
climb
up
a
small
tree
near
to
which
he
stood
mahtawa
looked
surprised
but
there
was
no
alternative
joe
authoritative
tone
brooked
no
delay
so
he
sprang
into
the
tree
like
a
monkey
crusoe
said
dick
him
the
dog
sat
quietly
down
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
savage
with
a
glare
that
spoke
unutterable
things
at
the
same
time
he
displayed
his
full
complement
of
teeth
and
uttered
a
sound
like
distant
thunder
joe
almost
laughed
and
henri
did
laugh
outright
come
along
he
safe
now
cried
dick
hurrying
away
in
the
direction
of
the
willow
bluff
which
they
soon
reached
and
found
that
the
faithful
squaw
had
tied
their
steeds
to
the
bushes
and
moreover
had
bundled
up
their
goods
into
a
pack
and
strapped
it
on
the
back
of
the
but
she
had
not
remained
with
them
bless
yer
dark
face
ejaculated
joe
as
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
rode
out
of
the
clump
of
bushes
he
was
followed
immediately
by
the
others
and
in
three
minutes
they
were
flying
over
the
plain
at
full
speed
on
gaining
the
last
ridge
that
afforded
a
distant
view
of
the
woods
skirting
the
pawnee
camp
they
drew
up
and
dick
putting
his
fingers
to
his
mouth
drew
a
long
shrill
whistle
it
reached
the
willow
bluff
like
a
faint
echo
at
the
same
moment
the
moon
arose
and
more
clearly
revealed
crusoe
cataleptic
glare
at
the
indian
chief
who
being
utterly
unarmed
was
at
the
dog
mercy
the
instant
the
whistle
fell
on
his
ear
however
he
dropped
his
eyes
covered
his
teeth
and
leaping
through
the
bushes
flew
over
the
plains
like
an
arrow
at
the
same
instant
mahtawa
descending
from
his
tree
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
towards
the
village
uttering
the
terrible
when
near
enough
to
be
heard
no
sound
sends
such
a
thrill
through
an
indian
camp
every
warrior
flew
to
arms
and
vaulted
on
his
steed
so
quickly
was
the
alarm
given
that
in
less
than
ten
minutes
a
thousand
hoofs
were
thundering
on
the
plain
and
faintly
reached
the
ears
of
the
fugitives
joe
smiled
it
puzzle
them
to
come
up
wi
nags
like
ours
in
prime
condition
too
lots
o
wind
in
em
if
we
only
keep
out
badger
holes
we
may
laugh
at
the
red
varmints
joe
opinion
of
indian
horses
was
correct
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
sound
of
hoofs
died
away
but
the
fugitives
did
not
draw
bridle
during
the
remainder
of
that
night
for
they
knew
not
how
long
the
pursuit
might
be
continued
by
pond
and
brook
and
bluff
they
passed
down
in
the
grassy
bottoms
and
over
the
prairie
waves
nor
checked
their
headlong
course
till
the
sun
blazed
over
the
level
sweep
of
the
eastern
plain
as
if
it
arose
out
of
the
mighty
ocean
then
they
sprang
from
the
saddle
and
hastily
set
about
the
preparation
of
their
morning
meal
chapter
xi
meditations
and
morning
reflections
buffaloes
badgers
antelopes
and
accidents
an
old
bull
and
the
wolves
mad
tails
henri
floored
there
is
nothing
that
prepares
one
so
well
for
the
enjoyment
of
rest
both
mental
and
physical
as
a
period
of
excitement
and
anxiety
followed
up
by
bodily
fatigue
excitement
alone
banishes
rest
but
united
with
severe
physical
exertion
it
prepares
for
it
at
least
courteous
reader
this
is
our
experience
and
certainly
this
was
the
experience
of
our
three
hunters
as
they
lay
on
their
backs
beneath
the
branches
of
a
willow
bush
and
gazed
serenely
up
at
the
twinkling
stars
two
days
after
their
escape
from
the
indian
village
they
spoke
little
they
were
too
tired
for
that
also
they
were
too
comfortable
their
respective
suppers
of
fresh
antelope
steak
shot
that
day
had
just
been
disposed
of
their
feet
were
directed
towards
the
small
fire
on
which
the
said
steaks
had
been
cooked
and
which
still
threw
a
warm
ruddy
glow
over
the
encampment
their
blankets
were
wrapped
comfortably
round
them
and
tucked
in
as
only
hunters
and
mothers
know
to
tuck
them
in
their
respective
pipes
delivered
forth
at
stated
intervals
three
richly
yellow
puffs
of
smoke
as
if
a
battery
were
playing
upon
the
sky
from
that
particular
spot
of
earth
the
horses
were
picketed
and
hobbled
in
a
rich
grassy
bottom
close
by
from
which
the
quiet
munch
of
their
equine
jaws
sounded
pleasantly
for
it
told
of
healthy
appetites
and
promised
speed
on
the
morrow
the
fear
of
being
overtaken
during
the
night
was
now
past
and
the
faithful
crusoe
by
virtue
of
sight
hearing
and
smell
guaranteed
them
against
sudden
attack
during
the
hours
of
slumber
a
perfume
of
wild
flowers
mingled
with
the
loved
odours
of
the
weed
and
the
tinkle
of
a
tiny
rivulet
fell
sweetly
on
their
ears
in
short
the
were
supremely
happy
and
disposed
to
be
thankful
for
their
recent
deliverance
and
their
present
comforts
i
wonder
what
the
stars
are
said
dick
languidly
taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
bits
o
fire
suggested
joe
i
tink
dey
are
vorlds
muttered
henri
an
have
peepels
in
dem
i
have
hear
men
say
dat
a
long
silence
followed
during
which
no
doubt
the
were
working
out
various
theories
in
their
own
minds
wonder
said
dick
again
how
far
off
they
be
a
mile
or
two
maybe
said
joe
henri
was
about
to
laugh
sarcastically
at
this
but
on
further
consideration
he
thought
it
would
be
more
comfortable
not
to
so
he
lay
still
in
another
minute
he
said
joe
blunt
you
is
ver
igrant
do
you
know
dat
de
books
say
de
stars
be
hondreds
tousands
oh
milleryons
of
mile
away
to
here
and
dat
dey
is
more
bigger
dan
dis
vorld
joe
snored
lightly
and
his
pipe
fell
out
of
his
mouth
at
this
point
so
the
conversation
dropped
presently
dick
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
say
henri
are
ye
asleep
oui
replied
henry
faintly
do
speak
or
you
vill
vaken
me
ah
crusoe
you
not
asleep
are
you
pup
no
need
to
ask
that
question
the
instantaneous
wag
of
that
speaking
tail
and
the
glance
of
that
wakeful
eye
as
the
dog
lifted
his
head
and
laid
his
chin
on
dick
arm
showed
that
he
had
been
listening
to
every
word
that
was
spoken
we
can
not
say
whether
he
understood
it
but
beyond
all
doubt
he
heard
it
crusoe
never
presumed
to
think
of
going
to
sleep
until
his
master
was
as
sound
as
a
top
then
he
ventured
to
indulge
in
that
light
species
of
slumber
which
is
familiarly
known
as
sleeping
with
one
eye
open
but
comparatively
as
well
as
figuratively
speaking
crusoe
slept
usually
with
one
eye
and
a
half
open
and
the
other
half
was
never
very
tightly
shut
gradually
dick
pipe
fell
out
of
his
mouth
an
event
which
the
dog
with
an
exercise
of
instinct
almost
if
not
quite
amounting
to
reason
regarded
as
a
signal
for
him
to
go
off
the
camp
fire
went
slowly
out
the
stars
twinkled
down
at
their
reflections
in
the
brook
and
a
deep
breathing
of
wearied
men
was
the
only
sound
that
rose
in
harmony
with
the
purling
stream
before
the
sun
rose
next
morning
and
while
many
of
the
brighter
stars
were
still
struggling
for
existence
with
the
approaching
day
joe
was
up
and
buckling
on
the
while
he
shouted
to
his
unwilling
companions
to
rise
if
it
depended
on
you
he
said
the
pawnees
would
be
long
afore
they
got
our
scalps
jump
ye
dogs
an
lend
a
hand
will
ye
a
snore
from
dick
and
a
deep
sigh
from
henri
was
the
answer
to
this
pathetic
appeal
it
so
happened
however
that
henri
pipe
in
falling
from
his
lips
had
emptied
the
ashes
just
under
his
nose
so
that
the
sigh
referred
to
drew
a
quantity
thereof
into
his
throat
and
almost
choked
him
nothing
could
have
been
a
more
effective
awakener
he
was
up
in
a
moment
coughing
vociferously
most
men
have
a
tendency
to
vent
on
some
one
and
they
generally
do
it
on
one
whom
they
deem
to
be
worse
than
themselves
henri
therefore
instead
of
growling
at
joe
for
rousing
him
scolded
dick
for
not
rising
ha
mauvais
dog
bad
chien
vill
you
dare
to
look
to
me
crusoe
did
look
with
amiable
placidity
as
though
to
say
howl
away
old
boy
i
wo
budge
till
dick
does
with
a
mighty
effort
giant
sleep
was
thrown
off
at
last
and
the
hunters
were
once
more
on
their
journey
cantering
lightly
over
the
soft
turf
ho
let
have
a
run
cried
dick
unable
to
repress
the
feelings
aroused
by
the
exhilarating
morning
air
have
a
care
boy
cried
joe
as
they
stretched
out
at
full
gallop
keep
off
the
ridge
it
riddled
wi
badger
ha
i
thought
so
at
that
moment
dick
horse
put
its
foot
into
a
and
turned
completely
over
sending
its
rider
through
the
air
in
a
curve
that
an
east
indian
acrobat
would
have
envied
for
a
few
seconds
dick
lay
flat
on
his
back
then
he
jumped
up
and
laughed
while
his
comrades
hurried
up
anxiously
to
his
assistance
no
bones
broke
inquired
joe
dick
gave
a
hysterical
gasp
i
i
think
not
let
have
a
look
no
nothin
to
speak
o
be
good
luck
ye
should
niver
go
slap
through
a
badger
country
like
that
boy
always
keep
the
bottoms
where
the
grass
is
short
now
then
up
ye
go
that
it
dick
remounted
though
not
with
quite
so
elastic
a
spring
as
usual
and
they
pushed
forward
at
a
more
reasonable
pace
accidents
of
this
kind
are
of
common
occurrence
in
the
prairies
some
horses
however
are
so
well
trained
that
they
look
sharp
out
for
these
holes
which
are
generally
found
to
be
most
numerous
on
the
high
and
dry
grounds
but
in
spite
of
all
the
caution
both
of
man
and
horse
many
ugly
falls
take
place
and
sometimes
bones
are
broken
they
had
not
gone
far
after
this
accident
when
an
antelope
leaped
from
a
clump
of
willows
and
made
for
a
belt
of
woodland
that
lay
along
the
margin
of
a
stream
not
off
hurrah
cried
dick
forgetting
his
recent
fall
come
along
crusoe
and
away
they
went
again
full
tilt
for
the
horse
had
not
been
injured
by
its
somersault
the
antelope
which
dick
was
thus
wildly
pursuing
was
of
the
same
species
as
the
one
he
had
shot
some
time
before
namely
the
antelope
these
graceful
creatures
have
long
slender
limbs
heads
and
large
beautiful
eyes
the
horns
are
black
and
rather
short
they
have
no
branches
like
the
antlers
of
the
but
have
a
single
projection
on
each
horn
near
the
head
and
the
extreme
points
of
the
horns
curve
suddenly
inwards
forming
the
hook
or
prong
from
which
the
name
of
the
animal
is
derived
their
colour
is
dark
yellowish
brown
they
are
so
fleet
that
not
one
horse
in
a
hundred
can
overtake
them
and
their
sight
and
sense
of
smell
are
so
acute
that
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
to
kill
them
were
it
not
for
the
inordinate
curiosity
which
we
have
before
referred
to
the
indians
manage
to
attract
these
simple
little
creatures
by
merely
lying
down
on
their
backs
and
kicking
their
heels
in
the
air
or
by
waving
any
white
object
on
the
point
of
an
arrow
while
the
hunter
keeps
concealed
by
lying
flat
in
the
grass
by
these
means
a
herd
of
antelopes
may
be
induced
to
wheel
round
and
round
an
object
in
timid
but
intense
surprise
gradually
approaching
until
they
come
near
enough
to
enable
the
hunter
to
make
sure
of
his
mark
thus
the
animals
which
of
all
others
to
be
the
most
difficult
to
slay
are
in
consequence
of
their
insatiable
curiosity
more
easily
shot
than
any
other
deer
of
the
plains
may
we
not
gently
suggest
to
the
reader
for
his
or
her
consideration
that
there
are
human
antelopes
so
to
speak
whose
case
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
of
the
north
american
prairie
dick
horse
was
no
match
for
the
antelope
neither
was
crusoe
so
they
pulled
up
shortly
and
returned
to
their
companions
to
be
laughed
at
it
no
manner
o
use
to
wind
yer
horse
lad
after
sich
game
they
not
much
worth
an
if
i
mistake
not
we
be
among
the
buffalo
soon
there
fresh
tracks
everywhere
and
the
herds
are
scattered
now
ye
see
when
they
keep
together
in
bands
o
thousands
ye
do
so
often
fall
in
wi
them
but
when
they
scatters
about
in
twos
an
threes
an
sixes
ye
may
shoot
them
every
day
as
much
as
ye
please
several
groups
of
buffalo
had
already
been
seen
on
the
horizon
but
as
a
had
been
shot
in
a
belt
of
woodland
the
day
before
they
did
not
pursue
them
the
is
very
much
larger
than
the
antelope
and
is
highly
esteemed
both
for
its
flesh
and
its
skin
which
latter
becomes
almost
like
chamois
leather
when
dressed
notwithstanding
this
supply
of
food
the
hunters
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
give
chase
to
a
herd
of
about
nine
buffaloes
that
suddenly
came
into
view
as
they
overtopped
an
undulation
in
the
plain
it
no
use
cried
dick
i
go
at
them
joe
himself
caught
fire
from
the
spirit
of
his
young
friend
so
calling
to
henri
to
come
on
and
let
the
remain
to
feed
he
dashed
away
in
pursuit
the
buffaloes
gave
one
stare
of
surprise
and
then
fled
as
fast
as
possible
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
such
huge
unwieldy
carcasses
could
not
run
very
fast
but
in
a
few
minutes
they
managed
to
get
up
a
pace
that
put
the
horses
to
their
mettle
indeed
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
the
hunters
did
not
gain
an
inch
but
by
degrees
they
closed
with
them
for
buffaloes
are
not
long
winded
on
nearing
the
herd
the
three
men
diverged
from
each
other
and
selected
their
animals
henri
being
naturally
singled
out
the
largest
and
the
largest
also
naturally
was
a
tough
old
bull
joe
brought
down
a
fat
young
cow
at
the
first
shot
and
dick
was
equally
fortunate
but
he
shot
crusoe
who
just
as
he
was
about
to
fire
rushed
in
unexpectedly
and
sprang
at
the
throat
for
which
piece
of
recklessness
he
was
ordered
back
to
watch
the
meanwhile
henri
by
dint
of
yelling
throwing
his
arms
wildly
about
and
digging
his
heels
into
the
sides
of
his
horse
succeeded
in
coming
close
up
with
the
bull
which
once
or
twice
turned
his
clumsy
body
half
round
and
glared
furiously
at
its
pursuer
with
its
small
black
eyes
suddenly
it
stuck
out
its
tail
stopped
short
and
turned
full
round
henri
stopped
short
also
now
the
sticking
out
of
a
buffalo
tail
has
a
peculiar
significance
which
it
is
well
to
point
out
it
serves
in
a
sense
the
same
purpose
to
the
hunter
that
the
compass
does
to
the
mariner
it
points
out
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
when
galloping
away
in
ordinary
flight
the
buffalo
carries
his
tail
like
ordinary
cattle
which
indicates
that
you
may
push
on
when
wounded
he
lashes
it
from
side
to
side
or
carries
it
over
his
back
up
in
the
air
this
indicates
look
out
haul
off
a
bit
but
when
he
carries
it
stiff
and
horizontal
with
a
in
the
middle
of
it
it
says
plainly
keep
back
or
kill
me
as
quick
as
you
can
for
that
is
what
indians
call
the
and
is
a
sign
that
mischief
is
brewing
henri
bull
displayed
the
mad
tail
just
before
turning
but
he
observe
it
and
accordingly
waited
for
the
bull
to
move
and
show
his
shoulder
for
a
favourable
shot
but
instead
of
doing
this
he
put
his
head
down
and
foaming
with
rage
went
at
him
full
tilt
the
big
horse
never
stirred
it
seemed
to
be
petrified
henri
had
just
time
to
fire
at
the
monster
neck
and
the
next
moment
was
sprawling
on
his
back
with
the
horse
rolling
over
four
or
five
yards
beyond
him
it
was
a
most
effective
tableau
henri
rubbing
his
shins
and
grinning
with
pain
the
horse
gazing
in
affright
as
he
rose
trembling
from
the
plain
and
the
buffalo
bull
looking
on
half
stunned
and
evidently
very
much
surprised
at
the
result
of
his
charge
fortunately
before
he
could
repeat
the
experiment
dick
galloped
up
and
put
a
ball
through
his
heart
joe
and
his
comrades
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
their
exploit
on
this
occasion
for
there
was
no
need
to
have
killed
three
animals
they
could
not
have
carried
with
them
more
than
a
small
portion
of
one
and
they
upbraided
themselves
several
times
during
the
operation
of
cutting
out
the
tongues
and
other
choice
portions
of
the
two
victims
as
for
the
bull
he
was
almost
totally
useless
so
they
left
him
as
a
gift
to
the
wolves
now
that
they
had
come
among
the
buffalo
wolves
were
often
seen
sneaking
about
and
licking
their
hungry
jaws
but
although
they
approached
pretty
near
to
the
camp
at
nights
they
did
not
give
the
hunters
any
concern
even
crusoe
became
accustomed
to
them
at
last
and
ceased
to
notice
them
these
creatures
are
very
dangerous
sometimes
however
and
when
hard
pressed
by
hunger
will
even
attack
man
the
day
after
this
hunt
the
travellers
came
upon
a
wounded
old
buffalo
which
had
evidently
escaped
from
the
indians
for
a
couple
of
arrows
were
sticking
in
its
side
only
to
fall
a
prey
to
his
deadly
enemies
the
white
wolves
these
savage
brutes
hang
on
the
skirts
of
the
herds
of
buffaloes
to
attack
and
devour
any
one
that
may
chance
from
old
age
or
from
being
wounded
to
linger
behind
the
rest
the
buffalo
is
tough
and
fierce
however
and
fights
so
desperately
that
although
surrounded
by
fifty
or
a
hundred
wolves
he
keeps
up
the
unequal
combat
for
several
days
before
he
finally
succumbs
the
old
bull
that
our
travellers
discovered
had
evidently
been
long
engaged
with
his
ferocious
adversaries
for
his
limbs
and
flesh
were
torn
in
shreds
in
many
places
and
blood
was
streaming
from
his
sides
yet
he
had
fought
so
gallantly
that
he
had
tossed
and
stamped
to
death
dozens
of
the
enemy
there
could
not
have
been
fewer
than
fifty
wolves
round
him
and
they
had
just
concluded
another
of
many
futile
attacks
when
the
hunters
came
up
for
they
were
ranged
in
a
circle
round
their
huge
adversary
some
lying
down
some
sitting
on
their
haunches
to
rest
and
others
sneaking
about
lolling
out
their
red
tongues
and
licking
their
chops
as
if
impatient
to
renew
the
combat
the
poor
buffalo
was
nearly
spent
and
it
was
clear
that
a
few
hours
more
would
see
him
torn
to
shreds
and
his
bones
picked
clean
ugh
de
brutes
ejaculated
henri
they
do
seem
to
mind
us
a
bit
remarked
dick
as
they
rode
up
to
within
pistol
shot
it
be
merciful
to
give
the
old
fellow
a
shot
said
joe
them
varmints
are
sure
to
finish
him
at
last
joe
raised
his
rifle
as
he
spoke
and
fired
the
old
bull
gave
his
last
groan
and
fell
while
the
wolves
alarmed
by
the
shot
fled
in
all
directions
but
they
did
not
run
far
they
knew
well
that
some
portion
at
least
of
the
carcass
would
fall
to
their
share
so
they
sat
down
at
various
distances
all
round
to
wait
as
patiently
as
they
might
for
the
hunters
to
retire
dick
left
the
scene
with
a
feeling
of
regret
that
the
villanous
wolves
should
have
their
feast
so
much
sooner
than
they
expected
yet
after
all
why
should
we
call
these
wolves
villanous
they
did
nothing
wrong
nothing
contrary
to
the
laws
of
their
peculiar
nature
nay
if
we
come
to
reason
upon
it
they
rank
higher
in
this
matter
than
man
for
while
the
wolf
does
no
violence
to
the
laws
of
its
instincts
man
often
deliberately
silences
the
voice
of
conscience
and
violates
the
laws
of
his
own
nature
but
we
will
not
insist
on
the
term
good
reader
if
you
object
strongly
to
it
we
are
willing
to
admit
that
the
wolves
are
villanous
but
they
are
unlovable
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
three
horsemen
reached
a
small
creek
the
banks
of
which
were
lined
with
a
few
stunted
shrubs
and
trees
having
eaten
nothing
since
the
night
before
they
dismounted
here
to
feed
as
joe
expressed
it
thing
remarked
joe
as
he
struck
a
light
by
means
of
flint
steel
and
thing
that
we
made
to
need
sich
a
lot
o
grub
if
we
could
only
get
on
like
the
sarpints
now
wot
can
breakfast
on
a
rabbit
and
then
wait
a
month
or
two
for
dinner
it
dick
admitted
that
it
was
and
stooped
to
blow
the
fire
into
a
blaze
here
henri
uttered
a
cry
of
consternation
and
stood
speechless
with
his
mouth
open
what
the
matter
what
cried
dick
and
joe
seizing
their
rifles
instinctively
de
grub
him
be
forgat
there
was
a
look
of
blank
horror
and
then
a
burst
of
laughter
from
dick
varley
well
well
cried
he
we
got
lots
o
tea
an
sugar
an
some
flour
we
can
git
on
wi
that
till
we
shoot
another
buffalo
or
a
ha
dick
observed
a
wild
turkey
stalking
among
the
willows
as
he
spoke
it
was
fully
a
hundred
yards
off
and
only
its
head
was
seen
above
the
leaves
this
was
a
matter
of
little
moment
however
for
by
aiming
a
little
lower
he
knew
that
he
must
hit
the
body
but
dick
had
driven
the
nail
too
often
to
aim
at
its
body
he
aimed
at
the
bird
eye
and
cut
its
head
off
fetch
it
crusoe
in
three
minutes
it
was
at
dick
feet
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
in
five
minutes
more
it
was
in
the
pot
as
this
unexpected
supply
made
up
for
the
loss
of
the
meat
which
henri
had
forgotten
at
their
last
their
equanimity
was
restored
and
while
the
meal
was
in
preparation
dick
shouldered
his
rifle
and
went
into
the
bush
to
try
for
another
turkey
he
did
not
get
one
however
but
he
shot
a
couple
of
which
are
excellent
eating
moreover
he
found
a
large
quantity
of
wild
grapes
and
plums
these
were
unfortunately
not
nearly
ripe
but
dick
resolved
to
try
his
hand
at
a
new
dish
so
he
stuffed
the
breast
of
his
coat
full
of
them
after
the
pot
was
emptied
dick
washed
it
out
and
put
a
little
clean
water
in
it
then
he
poured
some
flour
in
and
stirred
it
well
while
this
was
heating
he
squeezed
the
sour
grapes
and
plums
into
what
joe
called
a
mush
mixed
it
with
a
spoonful
of
sugar
and
emptied
it
into
the
pot
he
also
skimmed
a
quantity
of
the
fat
from
the
remains
of
the
turkey
soup
and
added
that
to
the
mess
which
he
stirred
with
earnest
diligence
till
it
boiled
down
into
a
sort
of
thick
porridge
d
think
it
be
good
asked
joe
gravely
i
me
doubts
of
it
we
hold
the
tin
dish
henri
take
care
of
de
fingers
ha
it
looks
magnifique
superb
the
first
spoonful
produced
an
expression
on
henri
face
that
needed
not
to
be
interpreted
it
was
as
sour
as
vinegar
ye
ha
to
eat
it
yerself
dick
lad
cried
joe
throwing
down
his
spoon
and
spitting
out
the
unsavoury
mess
nonsense
cried
dick
bolting
two
or
three
mouthfuls
and
trying
to
look
as
if
he
liked
it
try
again
it
not
so
bad
as
you
think
cried
henri
after
the
second
mouthful
tis
vinégre

would
not
make
more
sweeter
one
bite
of
it
dick
was
obliged
to
confess
the
dish
a
failure
so
it
was
thrown
out
after
having
been
offered
to
crusoe
who
gave
it
one
sniff
and
turned
away
in
silence
then
they
mounted
and
resumed
their
journey
at
this
place
mosquitoes
and
troubled
our
hunters
and
their
steeds
a
good
deal
the
latter
especially
were
very
annoying
to
the
poor
horses
they
bit
them
so
much
that
the
blood
at
last
came
trickling
down
their
sides
they
were
troubled
also
once
or
twice
by
cockchafers
and
locusts
which
annoyed
them
not
indeed
by
biting
but
by
flying
blindly
against
their
faces
and
missed
hitting
them
in
the
eyes
once
particularly
they
were
so
bad
that
henri
in
his
wrath
opened
his
lips
to
pronounce
a
malediction
on
the
whole
race
when
a
cockchafer
flew
straight
into
his
mouth
and
to
use
his
own
forcible
expression
nearly
knocked
him
off
de
hoss
but
these
were
minor
evils
and
scarcely
cost
the
hunters
a
thought
chapter
xii
on
the
war
by
bold
leap
for
for
many
days
the
three
hunters
wandered
over
the
trackless
prairie
in
search
of
a
village
of
the
sioux
indians
but
failed
to
find
one
for
the
indians
were
in
the
habit
of
shifting
their
ground
and
following
the
buffalo
several
times
they
saw
small
isolated
bands
of
indians
but
these
they
carefully
avoided
fearing
they
might
turn
out
to
be
war
parties
and
if
they
fell
into
their
hands
the
white
men
could
not
expect
civil
treatment
whatever
nation
the
indians
might
belong
to
during
the
greater
portion
of
this
time
they
met
with
numerous
herds
of
buffalo
and
deer
and
were
well
supplied
with
food
but
they
had
to
cook
it
during
the
day
being
afraid
to
light
a
fire
at
night
while
indians
were
prowling
about
one
night
they
halted
near
the
bed
of
a
stream
which
was
almost
dry
they
had
travelled
a
day
and
a
night
without
water
and
both
men
and
horses
were
almost
choking
so
that
when
they
saw
the
trees
on
the
horizon
which
indicated
the
presence
of
a
stream
they
pushed
forward
with
almost
frantic
haste
hope
it
not
dry
said
joe
anxiously
as
they
galloped
up
to
it
no
there
water
lads
and
they
dashed
forward
to
a
pool
that
had
not
yet
been
dried
up
they
drank
long
and
eagerly
before
they
noticed
that
the
pool
was
strongly
impregnated
with
salt
many
streams
in
those
parts
of
the
prairies
are
quite
salt
but
fortunately
this
one
was
not
utterly
undrinkable
though
it
was
very
unpalatable
we
make
it
better
lads
said
joe
digging
a
deep
hole
in
the
sand
with
his
hands
a
little
below
the
pool
in
a
short
time
the
water
filtered
through
and
though
not
rendered
fresh
it
was
nevertheless
much
improved
we
may
light
a
fire
d
think
inquired
dick
we
not
seed
injuns
for
some
days
be
better
not
said
joe
but
i
daresay
we
safe
enough
a
fire
was
therefore
lighted
in
as
sheltered
a
spot
as
could
be
found
and
the
three
friends
bivouacked
as
usual
towards
dawn
they
were
aroused
by
an
angry
growl
from
crusoe
it
a
wolf
likely
said
dick
but
all
three
seized
and
cocked
their
rifles
nevertheless
again
crusoe
growled
more
angrily
than
before
and
springing
out
of
the
camp
snuffed
the
breeze
anxiously
up
lads
catch
the
nags
there
something
in
the
wind
for
the
dog
niver
did
that
afore
in
a
few
seconds
the
horses
were
saddled
and
the
packs
secured
call
in
the
dog
whispered
joe
blunt
if
he
barks
they
find
out
our
whereabouts
here
crusoe
come
it
was
too
late
the
dog
barked
loudly
and
savagely
at
the
moment
and
a
troop
of
indians
came
coursing
over
the
plain
on
hearing
the
unwonted
sound
they
wheeled
directly
and
made
for
the
camp
it
a
war
party
fly
lads
nothin
save
our
scalps
now
but
our
horses
heels
cried
joe
in
a
moment
they
vaulted
into
the
saddle
and
urged
their
steeds
forward
at
the
utmost
speed
the
savages
observed
them
and
with
an
exulting
yell
dashed
after
them
feeling
that
there
was
now
no
need
of
concealment
the
three
horsemen
struck
off
into
the
open
prairie
intending
to
depend
entirely
on
the
speed
and
stamina
of
their
horses
as
we
have
before
remarked
they
were
good
ones
but
the
indians
soon
proved
that
they
were
equally
well
if
not
better
mounted
it
be
a
hard
run
said
joe
in
a
low
muttering
tone
and
looking
furtively
over
his
shoulder
the
varmints
are
mounted
on
wild
horses
leastways
they
were
wild
not
long
agone
them
chaps
can
throw
the
lasso
and
trip
a
mustang
as
well
as
a
mexican
mind
the
hold
in
a
bit
henri
yer
nag
do
need
drivin
a
foot
in
a
hole
just
now
would
cost
us
our
scalps
keep
down
by
the
creek
lads
ha
how
dey
yell
said
henri
in
a
savage
tone
looking
back
and
shaking
his
rifle
at
them
an
act
that
caused
them
to
yell
more
fiercely
than
ever
dis
old
give
me
moche
trobel
the
pace
was
now
tremendous
pursuers
and
pursued
rose
and
sank
on
the
prairie
billows
as
they
swept
along
till
they
came
to
what
is
termed
a
dividing
ridge
which
is
a
cross
wave
as
it
were
that
cuts
the
others
in
two
thus
forming
a
continuous
level
here
they
advanced
more
easily
but
the
advantage
was
equally
shared
with
their
pursuers
who
continued
the
headlong
pursuit
with
occasional
yells
which
served
to
show
the
fugitives
that
they
at
least
did
not
gain
ground
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
direction
in
which
they
were
flying
a
blue
line
was
seen
on
the
horizon
this
indicated
the
existence
of
trees
to
joe
practised
eyes
and
feeling
that
if
the
horses
broke
down
they
could
better
make
a
last
manful
stand
in
the
wood
than
on
the
plain
he
urged
his
steed
towards
it
the
savages
noticed
the
movement
at
once
and
uttered
a
yell
of
exultation
for
they
regarded
it
as
an
evidence
that
the
fugitives
doubted
the
strength
of
their
horses
ye
have
got
us
yet
muttered
joe
with
a
sardonic
grin
if
they
get
near
us
dick
keep
yer
eyes
open
an
look
out
for
yer
neck
else
they
drop
a
noose
over
it
they
will
afore
ye
know
they
near
an
haul
ye
off
like
a
sack
dick
nodded
in
reply
but
did
not
speak
for
at
that
moment
his
eye
was
fixed
on
a
small
creek
ahead
which
they
must
necessarily
leap
or
dash
across
it
was
lined
with
clumps
of
scattered
shrubbery
and
he
glanced
rapidly
for
the
most
suitable
place
to
pass
joe
and
henri
did
the
same
and
having
diverged
a
little
to
the
different
points
chosen
they
dashed
through
the
shrubbery
and
were
hid
from
each
other
view
on
approaching
the
edge
of
the
stream
dick
found
to
his
consternation
that
the
bank
was
twenty
feet
high
opposite
him
and
too
wide
for
any
horse
to
clear
wheeling
aside
without
checking
speed
at
the
risk
of
throwing
his
steed
he
rode
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
for
a
few
hundred
yards
until
he
found
a
ford
at
least
such
a
spot
as
might
be
cleared
by
a
bold
leap
the
temporary
check
however
had
enabled
an
indian
to
gain
so
close
upon
his
heels
that
his
exulting
yell
sounded
close
in
his
ear
with
a
vigorous
bound
his
gallant
little
horse
went
over
crusoe
could
not
take
it
but
he
rushed
down
the
one
bank
and
up
the
other
so
that
he
only
lost
a
few
yards
these
few
yards
however
were
sufficient
to
bring
the
indian
close
upon
him
as
he
cleared
the
stream
at
full
gallop
the
savage
whirled
his
lasso
swiftly
round
for
a
second
and
in
another
moment
crusoe
uttered
a
tremendous
roar
as
he
was
tripped
up
violently
on
the
plain
dick
heard
the
cry
of
his
faithful
dog
and
turned
quickly
round
just
in
time
to
see
him
spring
at
the
horse
throat
and
bring
both
steed
and
rider
down
upon
him
dick
heart
leaped
to
his
throat
had
a
thousand
savages
been
rushing
on
him
he
would
have
flown
to
the
rescue
of
his
favourite
but
an
unexpected
obstacle
came
in
the
way
his
fiery
little
steed
excited
by
the
headlong
race
and
the
howls
of
the
indians
had
taken
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
was
now
unmanageable
dick
tore
at
the
reins
like
a
maniac
and
in
the
height
of
his
frenzy
even
raised
the
butt
of
his
rifle
with
the
intent
to
strike
the
poor
horse
to
the
earth
but
his
better
nature
prevailed
he
checked
the
uplifted
hand
and
with
a
groan
dropped
the
reins
and
sank
almost
helplessly
forward
on
the
saddle
for
several
of
the
indians
had
left
the
main
body
and
were
pursuing
him
alone
so
that
there
would
have
been
now
no
chance
of
his
reaching
the
place
where
crusoe
fell
even
if
he
could
have
turned
his
horse
spiritless
and
utterly
indifferent
to
what
his
fate
might
be
dick
varley
rode
along
with
his
head
drooping
and
keeping
his
seat
almost
mechanically
while
the
mettlesome
little
steed
flew
on
over
wave
and
hollow
gradually
he
awakened
from
this
state
of
despair
to
a
sense
of
danger
glancing
round
he
observed
that
the
indians
were
now
far
behind
him
though
still
pursuing
he
also
observed
that
his
companions
were
galloping
miles
away
on
the
horizon
to
the
left
and
that
he
had
foolishly
allowed
the
savages
to
get
between
him
and
them
the
only
chance
that
remained
for
him
was
to
outride
his
pursuers
and
circle
round
towards
his
comrades
and
this
he
hoped
to
accomplish
for
his
little
horse
had
now
proved
itself
to
be
superior
to
those
of
the
indians
and
there
was
good
running
in
him
still
urging
him
forward
therefore
he
soon
left
the
savages
still
farther
behind
and
feeling
confident
that
they
could
not
now
overtake
him
he
reined
up
and
dismounted
the
pursuers
quickly
drew
near
but
short
though
it
was
the
rest
did
his
horse
good
vaulting
into
the
saddle
he
again
stretched
out
and
now
skirted
along
the
margin
of
a
wood
which
seemed
to
mark
the
position
of
a
river
of
considerable
size
at
this
moment
his
horse
put
his
foot
into
a
and
both
of
them
came
heavily
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
dick
rose
picked
up
his
gun
and
leaped
unhurt
into
the
saddle
but
on
urging
his
poor
horse
forward
he
found
that
its
shoulder
was
badly
sprained
there
was
no
room
for
mercy
however
life
and
death
were
in
the
balance
so
he
plied
the
lash
vigorously
and
the
noble
steed
warmed
into
something
like
a
run
when
again
it
stumbled
and
fell
with
a
crash
on
the
ground
while
the
blood
burst
from
its
mouth
and
nostrils
dick
could
hear
the
shout
of
triumph
uttered
by
his
pursuers
my
poor
poor
horse
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
commiseration
while
he
stooped
and
stroked
its
neck
the
dying
steed
raised
its
head
for
a
moment
it
almost
seemed
as
if
to
acknowledge
the
tones
of
affection
then
it
sank
down
with
a
gurgling
groan
dick
sprang
up
for
the
indians
were
now
upon
him
and
bounded
like
an
antelope
into
the
thickest
of
the
shrubbery
which
was
nowhere
thick
enough
however
to
prevent
the
indians
following
still
it
sufficiently
retarded
them
to
render
the
chase
a
more
equal
one
than
could
have
been
expected
in
a
few
minutes
dick
gained
a
strip
of
open
ground
beyond
and
found
himself
on
the
bank
of
a
broad
river
whose
evidently
deep
waters
rushed
impetuously
along
their
unobstructed
channel
the
bank
at
the
spot
where
he
reached
it
was
a
sheer
precipice
of
between
thirty
and
forty
feet
high
glancing
up
and
down
the
river
he
retreated
a
few
paces
turned
round
and
shook
his
clenched
fist
at
the
savages
accompanying
the
action
with
a
shout
of
defiance
and
then
running
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
sprang
far
out
into
the
boiling
flood
and
sank
the
indians
pulled
up
on
reaching
the
spot
there
was
no
possibility
of
galloping
down
the
banks
after
the
fugitive
but
quick
as
thought
each
leaped
to
the
ground
and
fitting
an
arrow
to
his
bow
awaited
dick
with
eager
gaze
young
though
he
was
and
unskilled
in
such
wild
warfare
dick
knew
well
enough
what
sort
of
reception
he
would
meet
with
on
coming
to
the
surface
so
he
kept
under
water
as
long
as
he
could
and
struck
out
as
vigorously
as
the
care
of
his
rifle
would
permit
at
last
he
rose
for
a
few
seconds
and
immediately
arrows
whizzed
through
the
air
but
most
of
them
fell
short
only
one
passed
close
to
his
cheek
and
went
with
a
whip
into
the
river
he
immediately
sank
again
and
the
next
time
he
rose
to
breathe
he
was
far
beyond
the
reach
of
his
indian
enemies
chapter
xiii
from
indians
a
discovery
alone
in
the
dick
varley
had
spent
so
much
of
his
boyhood
in
sporting
about
among
the
waters
of
the
rivers
and
lakes
near
which
he
had
been
reared
and
especially
during
the
last
two
years
had
spent
so
much
of
his
leisure
time
in
rolling
and
diving
with
his
dog
crusoe
in
the
lake
of
the
mustang
valley
that
he
had
become
almost
as
expert
in
the
water
as
a
south
sea
islander
so
that
when
he
found
himself
whirling
down
the
rapid
river
as
already
described
he
was
more
impressed
with
a
feeling
of
gratitude
to
god
for
his
escape
from
the
indians
than
anxiety
about
getting
ashore
he
was
not
altogether
blind
or
indifferent
to
the
danger
into
which
he
might
be
hurled
if
the
channel
of
the
river
should
be
found
lower
down
to
be
broken
with
rocks
or
should
a
waterfall
unexpectedly
appear
after
floating
down
a
sufficient
distance
to
render
pursuit
out
of
the
question
he
struck
into
the
bank
opposite
to
that
from
which
he
had
plunged
and
clambering
up
to
the
greensward
above
stripped
off
the
greater
part
of
his
clothing
and
hung
it
on
the
branches
of
a
bush
to
dry
then
he
sat
down
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
to
consider
what
course
he
had
best
pursue
in
his
present
circumstances
these
circumstances
were
by
no
means
calculated
to
inspire
him
with
hope
or
comfort
he
was
in
the
midst
of
an
unknown
wilderness
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
white
man
settlement
surrounded
by
savages
without
food
or
blanket
his
companions
gone
he
knew
not
whither
perhaps
taken
and
killed
by
the
indians
his
horse
dead
and
his
dog
the
most
trusty
and
loving
of
all
his
friends
lost
to
him
probably
for
ever
a
more
veteran
heart
might
have
quailed
in
the
midst
of
such
accumulated
evils
but
dick
varley
possessed
a
strong
young
and
buoyant
constitution
which
united
with
a
hopefulness
of
disposition
that
almost
nothing
could
overcome
enabled
him
very
quickly
to
cast
aside
the
gloomy
view
of
his
case
and
turn
to
its
brighter
aspects
he
still
grasped
his
good
rifle
that
was
some
comfort
and
as
his
eye
fell
upon
it
he
turned
with
anxiety
to
examine
into
the
condition
of
his
and
the
few
things
that
he
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
carry
away
with
him
about
his
person
the
horn
in
which
western
hunters
carry
their
powder
is
usually
that
of
an
ox
it
is
closed
up
at
the
large
end
with
a
piece
of
hard
wood
fitted
tightly
into
it
and
the
small
end
is
closed
with
a
wooden
peg
or
stopper
it
is
therefore
completely
and
may
be
for
hours
immersed
without
the
powder
getting
wet
unless
the
stopper
should
chance
to
be
knocked
out
dick
found
to
his
great
satisfaction
that
the
stopper
was
fast
and
the
powder
perfectly
dry
moreover
he
had
by
good
fortune
filled
it
full
two
days
before
from
the
package
that
contained
the
general
stock
of
ammunition
so
that
there
were
only
two
or
three
charges
out
of
it
his
percussion
caps
however
were
completely
destroyed
and
even
though
they
had
not
been
it
would
have
mattered
little
for
he
did
not
possess
more
than
but
this
was
not
so
great
a
misfortune
as
at
first
it
might
seem
for
he
had
the
spare
flint
locks
and
the
little
necessary
for
fixing
and
unfixing
them
stowed
away
in
his
shot
pouch
to
examine
his
supply
of
bullets
was
his
next
care
and
slowly
he
counted
them
out
one
by
one
to
the
number
of
thirty
this
was
a
pretty
fair
supply
and
with
careful
economy
would
last
him
many
days
having
relieved
his
mind
on
these
points
he
carefully
examined
every
pouch
and
corner
of
his
dress
to
ascertain
the
exact
amount
and
value
of
his
wealth
besides
the
leather
leggings
moccasins
deerskin
cap
and
belt
which
composed
his
costume
he
had
a
short
heavy
a
piece
of
tinder
a
little
tin
pannikin
which
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
at
his
belt
and
a
large
cake
of
maple
sugar
this
last
is
a
species
of
sugar
which
is
procured
by
the
indians
from
the
several
cakes
of
it
had
been
carried
off
from
the
pawnee
village
and
dick
usually
carried
one
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
besides
these
things
he
found
that
the
little
bible
for
which
his
mother
had
made
a
small
inside
was
safe
dick
heart
smote
him
when
he
took
it
out
and
undid
the
clasp
for
he
had
not
looked
at
it
until
that
day
it
was
firmly
bound
with
a
brass
clasp
so
that
although
the
binding
and
the
edges
of
the
leaves
were
soaked
the
inside
was
quite
dry
on
opening
the
book
to
see
if
it
had
been
damaged
a
small
paper
fell
out
picking
it
up
quickly
he
unfolded
it
and
read
in
his
mother
handwriting
upon
me
in
the
time
of
trouble
and
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
my
son
give
me
thine
dick
eyes
filled
with
tears
while
the
sound
as
it
were
of
his
mother
voice
thus
reached
him
unexpectedly
in
that
lonely
wilderness
like
too
many
whose
hearts
are
young
and
gay
dick
had
regarded
religion
if
not
as
a
gloomy
at
least
as
not
a
cheerful
thing
but
he
felt
the
comfort
of
these
words
at
that
moment
and
he
resolved
seriously
to
peruse
his
mother
parting
gift
in
time
to
come
the
sun
was
hot
and
a
warm
breeze
gently
shook
the
leaves
so
that
dick
garments
were
soon
dry
a
few
minutes
served
to
change
the
locks
of
his
rifle
draw
the
wet
charges
dry
out
the
barrels
and
then
throwing
it
across
his
shoulder
he
entered
the
wood
and
walked
lightly
away
and
well
he
might
poor
fellow
for
at
that
moment
he
felt
light
enough
in
person
if
not
in
heart
his
worldly
goods
were
not
such
as
to
oppress
him
but
the
little
note
had
turned
his
thoughts
towards
home
and
he
felt
comforted
traversing
the
belt
of
woodland
that
marked
the
course
of
the
river
dick
soon
emerged
on
the
wide
prairie
beyond
and
here
he
paused
in
some
uncertainty
as
to
how
he
should
proceed
he
was
too
good
a
backwoodsman
albeit
so
young
to
feel
perplexed
as
to
the
points
of
the
compass
he
knew
pretty
well
what
hour
it
was
so
that
the
sun
showed
him
the
general
bearings
of
the
country
and
he
knew
that
when
night
came
he
could
correct
his
course
by
the
pole
star
dick
knowledge
of
astronomy
was
limited
he
knew
only
one
star
by
name
but
that
one
was
an
inestimable
treasure
of
knowledge
his
perplexity
was
owing
to
his
uncertainty
as
to
the
direction
in
which
his
companions
and
their
pursuers
had
gone
for
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
follow
their
trail
if
possible
and
render
all
the
succour
his
single
arm
might
afford
to
desert
them
and
make
for
the
settlement
he
held
would
be
a
faithless
and
cowardly
act
while
they
were
together
joe
blunt
had
often
talked
to
him
about
the
route
he
meant
to
pursue
to
the
rocky
mountains
so
that
if
they
had
escaped
the
indians
he
thought
there
might
be
some
chance
of
finding
them
at
last
but
to
set
against
this
there
was
the
probability
that
they
had
been
taken
and
carried
away
in
a
totally
different
direction
or
they
might
have
taken
to
the
river
as
he
had
done
and
gone
farther
down
without
his
observing
them
then
again
if
they
had
escaped
they
would
be
sure
to
return
and
search
the
country
round
for
him
so
that
if
he
left
the
spot
he
might
miss
them
oh
for
my
dear
pup
crusoe
he
exclaimed
aloud
in
this
dilemma
but
the
faithful
ear
was
shut
now
and
the
deep
silence
that
followed
his
cry
was
so
oppressive
that
the
young
hunter
sprang
forward
at
a
run
over
the
plain
as
if
to
fly
from
solitude
he
soon
became
so
absorbed
however
in
his
efforts
to
find
the
trail
of
his
companions
that
he
forgot
all
other
considerations
and
ran
straight
forward
for
hours
together
with
his
eyes
eagerly
fixed
on
the
ground
at
last
he
felt
so
hungry
having
tasted
no
food
since
the
previous
evening
that
he
halted
for
the
purpose
of
eating
a
morsel
of
maple
sugar
a
line
of
bushes
in
the
distance
indicated
water
so
he
sped
on
again
and
was
soon
seated
beneath
a
willow
drinking
water
from
the
cool
stream
no
game
was
to
be
found
here
but
there
were
several
kinds
of
berries
among
which
wild
grapes
and
plums
grew
in
abundance
with
these
and
some
sugar
he
made
a
meal
though
not
a
good
one
for
the
berries
were
quite
green
and
intensely
sour
all
that
day
dick
varley
followed
up
the
trail
of
his
companions
which
he
discovered
at
a
ford
in
the
river
they
had
crossed
therefore
in
safety
though
still
pursued
so
he
ran
on
at
a
regular
trot
and
with
a
little
more
hope
than
he
had
felt
during
the
day
towards
night
however
dick
heart
sank
again
for
he
came
upon
innumerable
buffalo
tracks
among
which
those
of
the
horses
soon
became
mingled
up
so
that
he
lost
them
altogether
hoping
to
find
them
again
more
easily
by
broad
daylight
he
went
to
the
nearest
clump
of
willows
he
could
find
and
encamped
for
the
night
remembering
the
use
formerly
made
of
the
tall
willows
he
set
to
work
to
construct
a
covering
to
protect
him
from
the
dew
as
he
had
no
blanket
or
buffalo
skin
he
used
leaves
and
grass
instead
and
found
it
a
better
shelter
than
he
had
expected
especially
when
the
fire
was
lighted
and
a
pannikin
of
hot
sugar
and
water
smoked
at
his
feet
but
as
no
game
was
to
be
found
he
was
again
compelled
to
sup
off
unripe
berries
before
lying
down
to
rest
he
remembered
his
resolution
and
pulling
out
the
little
bible
read
a
portion
of
it
by
the
fitful
blaze
of
the
fire
and
felt
great
comfort
in
its
blessed
words
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
friend
with
whom
he
could
converse
in
the
midst
of
his
loneliness
the
plunge
into
the
river
having
broken
dick
pipe
and
destroyed
his
tobacco
he
now
felt
the
want
of
that
luxury
very
severely
and
never
having
wanted
it
before
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
how
much
he
had
become
enslaved
to
the
habit
it
cost
him
more
than
an
hour
rest
that
night
the
craving
for
his
wonted
pipe
the
sagacious
reader
will
doubtless
not
fail
here
to
ask
himself
the
question
whether
it
is
wise
in
man
to
create
in
himself
an
unnatural
and
totally
unnecessary
appetite
which
may
and
often
does
entail
hours
ay
sometimes
months
of
exceeding
discomfort
but
we
would
not
for
a
moment
presume
to
suggest
such
a
question
to
him
we
have
a
distinct
objection
to
the
ordinary
method
of
what
is
called
drawing
a
moral
it
is
much
better
to
leave
wise
men
to
do
this
for
themselves
next
morning
dick
rose
with
the
sun
and
started
without
breakfast
preferring
to
take
his
chance
of
finding
a
bird
or
animal
of
some
kind
before
long
to
feeding
again
on
sour
berries
he
was
disappointed
however
in
finding
the
tracks
of
his
companions
the
ground
here
was
hard
and
sandy
so
that
little
or
no
impression
of
a
distinct
kind
was
made
on
it
and
as
buffaloes
had
traversed
it
in
all
directions
he
was
soon
utterly
bewildered
he
thought
it
possible
that
by
running
out
for
several
miles
in
a
straight
line
and
then
taking
a
wide
circuit
round
he
might
find
the
tracks
emerging
from
the
confusion
made
by
the
buffaloes
but
he
was
again
disappointed
for
the
buffalo
tracks
still
continued
and
the
ground
became
less
capable
of
showing
a
footprint
soon
dick
began
to
feel
so
ill
and
weak
from
eating
such
poor
fare
that
he
gave
up
all
hope
of
discovering
the
tracks
and
was
compelled
to
push
forward
at
his
utmost
speed
in
order
to
reach
a
less
barren
district
where
he
might
procure
fresh
meat
but
the
farther
he
advanced
the
worse
and
more
sandy
did
the
district
become
for
several
days
he
pushed
on
over
this
arid
waste
without
seeing
bird
or
beast
and
to
add
to
his
misery
he
failed
at
last
to
find
water
for
a
day
and
a
night
he
wandered
about
in
a
burning
fever
and
his
throat
so
parched
that
he
was
almost
suffocated
towards
the
close
of
the
second
day
he
saw
a
slight
line
of
bushes
away
down
in
a
hollow
on
his
right
with
eager
steps
he
staggered
towards
them
and
on
drawing
near
beheld
blessed
sight
a
stream
of
water
glancing
in
the
beams
of
the
setting
sun
dick
tried
to
shout
for
joy
but
his
parched
throat
refused
to
give
utterance
to
the
voice
it
mattered
not
exerting
all
his
remaining
strength
he
rushed
down
the
bank
dropped
his
rifle
and
plunged
headforemost
into
the
stream
the
first
mouthful
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
to
his
heart
it
was
salt
as
brine
the
poor
youth
cup
of
bitterness
was
now
full
to
overflowing
crawling
out
of
the
stream
he
sank
down
on
the
bank
in
a
species
of
lethargic
torpor
from
which
he
awakened
next
morning
in
a
raging
fever
delirium
soon
rendered
him
insensible
to
his
sufferings
the
sun
rose
like
a
ball
of
fire
and
shone
down
with
scorching
power
on
the
arid
plain
what
mattered
it
to
dick
he
was
far
away
in
the
shady
groves
of
the
mustang
valley
chasing
the
deer
at
times
but
more
frequently
cooling
his
limbs
and
sporting
with
crusoe
in
the
bright
blue
lake
now
he
was
in
his
mother
cottage
telling
her
how
he
had
thought
of
her
when
far
away
on
the
prairie
and
what
a
bright
sweet
word
it
was
she
had
whispered
in
his
ear
so
unexpectedly
too
anon
he
was
scouring
over
the
plains
on
horseback
with
the
savages
at
his
heels
and
at
such
times
dick
would
spring
with
almost
supernatural
strength
from
the
ground
and
run
madly
over
the
burning
plain
but
as
if
by
a
species
of
fascination
he
always
returned
to
the
salt
river
and
sank
exhausted
by
its
side
or
plunged
helplessly
into
its
waters
these
sudden
immersions
usually
restored
him
for
a
short
time
to
reason
and
he
would
crawl
up
the
bank
and
gnaw
a
morsel
of
the
maple
sugar
but
he
could
not
eat
much
for
it
was
in
a
tough
compact
cake
which
his
jaws
had
not
power
to
break
all
that
day
and
the
next
night
he
lay
on
the
banks
of
the
salt
stream
or
rushed
wildly
over
the
plain
it
was
about
noon
of
the
second
day
after
his
attack
that
he
crept
slowly
out
of
the
water
into
which
he
had
plunged
a
few
seconds
before
his
mind
was
restored
but
he
felt
an
indescribable
sensation
of
weakness
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
approach
of
death
creeping
towards
the
place
where
his
rifle
lay
he
fell
exhausted
beside
it
and
laid
his
cheek
on
the
bible
which
had
fallen
out
of
his
pocket
there
while
his
eyes
were
closed
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
slumber
he
felt
the
rough
hairy
coat
of
an
animal
brush
against
his
forehead
the
idea
of
being
torn
to
pieces
by
wolves
flashed
instantly
across
his
mind
and
with
a
shriek
of
terror
he
sprang
up
to
be
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
caresses
of
his
faithful
dog
yes
there
he
was
bounding
round
his
master
barking
and
whining
and
giving
vent
to
every
possible
expression
of
canine
joy

but

concluded
he
was
almost
crushed
to
death
and
the
instant
the
indian
gained
his
feet
he
sent
an
arrow
at
his
head
with
savage
violence
crusoe
however
had
been
so
well
used
to
dodging
the
arrows
that
were
wont
to
be
shot
at
him
by
the
boys
of
the
mustang
valley
that
he
was
quite
prepared
and
eluded
the
shaft
by
an
active
bound
moreover
he
uttered
one
of
his
own
peculiar
roars
flew
at
the
indian
throat
and
dragged
him
down
at
the
same
moment
the
other
indians
came
up
and
one
of
them
turned
aside
to
the
rescue
this
man
happened
to
have
an
old
gun
of
the
cheap
sort
at
that
time
exchanged
for
peltries
by
the
with
the
butt
of
this
he
struck
crusoe
a
blow
on
the
head
that
sent
him
sprawling
on
the
grass
the
rest
of
the
savages
as
we
have
seen
continued
in
pursuit
of
dick
until
he
leaped
into
the
river
then
they
returned
took
the
saddle
and
bridle
off
his
dead
horse
and
rejoined
their
comrades
here
they
held
a
on
crusoe
who
was
now
bound
foot
and
muzzle
with
cords
some
were
for
killing
him
others
who
admired
his
noble
appearance
immense
size
and
courage
thought
it
would
be
well
to
carry
him
to
their
village
and
keep
him
there
was
a
pretty
violent
dispute
on
the
subject
but
at
length
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
spare
his
life
in
the
meantime
and
perhaps
have
a
round
him
when
they
got
to
their
wigwams
this
dance
of
which
crusoe
was
to
be
the
chief
though
passive
performer
is
peculiar
to
some
of
the
tribes
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
consists
in
killing
a
dog
and
cutting
out
its
liver
which
is
afterwards
sliced
into
shreds
or
strings
and
hung
on
a
pole
about
the
height
of
a
man
head
a
band
of
warriors
then
come
and
dance
wildly
round
this
pole
and
each
one
in
succession
goes
up
to
the
raw
liver
and
bites
a
piece
off
it
without
however
putting
his
hands
near
it
such
is
the
and
to
such
was
poor
crusoe
destined
by
his
fierce
captors
especially
by
the
one
whose
throat
still
bore
very
evident
marks
of
his
teeth
but
crusoe
was
much
too
clever
a
dog
to
be
disposed
of
in
so
disgusting
a
manner
he
had
privately
resolved
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
escape
but
the
hopelessness
of
his
ever
carrying
that
resolution
into
effect
would
have
been
apparent
to
any
one
who
could
have
seen
the
way
in
which
his
muzzle
was
secured
and
his
four
paws
were
tied
together
in
a
bunch
as
he
hung
suspended
across
the
saddle
of
one
of
the
savages
this
particular
party
of
indians
who
had
followed
dick
varley
determined
not
to
wait
for
the
return
of
their
comrades
who
were
in
pursuit
of
the
other
two
hunters
but
to
go
straight
home
so
for
several
days
they
galloped
away
over
the
prairie
at
nights
when
they
encamped
crusoe
was
thrown
on
the
ground
like
a
piece
of
old
lumber
and
left
to
lie
there
with
a
mere
scrap
of
food
till
morning
when
he
was
again
thrown
across
the
horse
of
his
captor
and
carried
on
when
the
village
was
reached
he
was
thrown
again
on
the
ground
and
would
certainly
have
been
torn
to
pieces
in
five
minutes
by
the
indian
curs
which
came
howling
round
him
had
not
an
old
woman
come
to
the
rescue
and
driven
them
away
with
the
help
of
her
a
little
naked
creature
just
able
to
walk
or
rather
to
stagger
she
dragged
him
to
her
tent
and
undoing
the
line
that
fastened
his
mouth
offered
him
a
bone
although
lying
in
a
position
that
was
unfavourable
for
eating
purposes
crusoe
opened
his
jaws
and
took
it
an
awful
crash
was
followed
by
two
crunches
and
it
was
gone
and
crusoe
looked
up
in
the
old
squaw
face
with
a
look
that
said
plainly
another
of
the
same
please
and
as
quick
as
possible
the
old
woman
gave
him
another
and
then
a
lump
of
meat
which
latter
went
down
with
a
gulp
but
he
coughed
after
it
and
it
was
well
he
did
choke
after
this
the
squaw
left
him
and
crusoe
spent
the
remainder
of
that
night
gnawing
the
cords
that
bound
him
so
diligent
was
he
that
he
was
free
before
morning
and
walked
deliberately
out
of
the
tent
then
he
shook
himself
and
with
a
yell
that
one
might
have
fancied
was
intended
for
defiance
he
bounded
joyfully
away
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
to
a
dog
with
a
good
appetite
which
had
been
on
short
allowance
for
several
days
the
mouthful
given
to
him
by
the
old
squaw
was
a
mere
nothing
all
that
day
he
kept
bounding
over
the
plain
from
bluff
to
bluff
in
search
of
something
to
eat
but
found
nothing
until
dusk
when
he
pounced
suddenly
and
most
unexpectedly
on
a
fast
asleep
in
one
moment
its
life
was
gone
in
less
than
a
minute
its
body
was
gone
too
feathers
and
bones
and
all
down
crusoe
ravenous
throat
on
the
identical
spot
crusoe
lay
down
and
slept
like
a
top
for
four
hours
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
jumped
up
bolted
a
scrap
of
skin
that
somehow
had
been
overlooked
at
supper
and
flew
straight
over
the
prairie
to
the
spot
where
he
had
had
the
scuffle
with
the
indian
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
river
took
precisely
the
same
leap
that
his
master
had
done
before
him
and
came
out
on
the
other
side
a
good
deal
higher
up
than
dick
had
done
for
the
dog
had
no
savages
to
dodge
and
was
as
we
have
said
before
a
powerful
swimmer
it
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
running
about
to
find
the
trail
and
it
was
nearly
dark
before
he
resumed
his
journey
then
putting
his
keen
nose
to
the
ground
he
ran
step
by
step
over
dick
track
and
at
last
found
him
as
we
have
shown
on
the
banks
of
the
salt
creek
it
is
quite
impossible
to
describe
the
intense
joy
which
filled
heart
on
again
beholding
his
favourite
only
those
who
have
lost
and
found
such
an
one
can
know
it
dick
seized
him
round
the
neck
and
hugged
him
as
well
as
he
could
poor
fellow
in
his
feeble
arms
then
he
wept
then
he
laughed
and
then
he
fainted
this
was
a
consummation
that
took
crusoe
quite
aback
never
having
seen
his
master
in
such
a
state
before
he
seemed
to
think
at
first
that
he
was
playing
some
trick
for
he
bounded
round
him
and
barked
and
wagged
his
tail
but
as
dick
lay
quite
still
and
motionless
he
went
forward
with
a
look
of
alarm
snuffed
him
once
or
twice
and
whined
piteously
then
he
raised
his
nose
in
the
air
and
uttered
a
long
melancholy
wail
the
cry
seemed
to
revive
dick
for
he
moved
and
with
some
difficulty
sat
up
to
the
dog
evident
relief
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
crusoe
learned
an
erroneous
lesson
that
day
and
was
firmly
convinced
thenceforth
that
the
best
cure
for
a
fainting
fit
is
a
melancholy
yell
so
easy
is
it
for
the
wisest
of
dogs
as
well
as
men
to
fall
into
gross
error
crusoe
said
dick
in
a
feeble
voice
dear
good
pup
come
here
he
crawled
as
he
spoke
down
to
the
water
edge
where
there
was
a
level
patch
of
dry
sand
dig
said
dick
pointing
to
the
sand
crusoe
looked
at
him
in
surprise
as
well
he
might
for
he
had
never
heard
the
word
dig
in
all
his
life
before
dick
pondered
a
minute
then
a
thought
struck
him
he
turned
up
a
little
of
the
sand
with
his
fingers
and
pointing
to
the
hole
cried
him
out
ha
crusoe
understood
many
and
many
a
time
had
he
unhoused
rabbits
and
squirrels
and
other
creatures
at
that
word
of
command
so
without
a
moment
delay
he
commenced
to
dig
down
into
the
sand
every
now
and
then
stopping
for
a
moment
and
shoving
in
his
nose
and
snuffing
interrogatively
as
if
he
fully
expected
to
find
a
buffalo
at
the
bottom
of
it
then
he
would
resume
again
one
paw
after
another
so
fast
that
you
could
scarce
see
them
going
hand
over
hand
as
sailors
would
have
called
it
while
the
sand
flew
out
between
his
hind
legs
in
a
continuous
shower
when
the
sand
accumulated
so
much
behind
him
as
to
impede
his
motions
he
scraped
it
out
of
his
way
and
set
to
work
again
with
tenfold
earnestness
after
a
good
while
he
paused
and
looked
up
at
dick
with
an
expression
on
his
face
seek
him
out
pup
repeated
dick
oh
very
good
mutely
answered
the
dog
and
went
at
it
again
tooth
and
nail
harder
than
ever
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
was
a
deep
yawning
hole
in
the
sand
into
which
dick
peered
with
intense
anxiety
the
bottom
appeared
slightly
hope
now
reanimated
dick
varley
and
by
various
devices
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
dog
to
scrape
away
a
sort
of
tunnel
from
the
hole
into
which
he
might
roll
himself
and
put
down
his
lips
to
drink
when
the
water
should
rise
high
enough
impatiently
and
anxiously
he
lay
watching
the
moisture
slowly
accumulate
in
the
bottom
of
the
hole
drop
by
drop
and
while
he
gazed
he
fell
into
a
troubled
restless
slumber
and
dreamed
that
crusoe
return
was
a
dream
and
that
he
was
alone
again
perishing
for
want
of
water
when
he
awakened
the
hole
was
half
full
of
clear
water
and
crusoe
was
lapping
it
greedily
back
pup
he
shouted
as
he
crept
down
to
the
hole
and
put
his
trembling
lips
to
the
water
it
was
brackish
but
drinkable
and
as
dick
drank
deeply
of
it
he
esteemed
it
at
that
moment
better
than
nectar
here
he
lay
for
alternately
drinking
and
gazing
in
surprise
at
his
own
emaciated
visage
as
reflected
in
the
pool
the
same
afternoon
crusoe
in
a
private
hunting
excursion
of
his
own
discovered
and
caught
a
which
he
quietly
proceeded
to
devour
on
the
spot
when
dick
who
saw
what
had
occurred
whistled
to
him
obedience
was
engrained
in
every
fibre
of
crusoe
mental
and
corporeal
being
he
did
not
merely
answer
at
once
to
the
call
he
to
it
leaving
the
untasted
fetch
it
pup
cried
dick
eagerly
as
the
dog
came
up
in
a
few
moments
the
hen
was
at
his
feet
dick
circumstances
could
not
brook
the
delay
of
cookery
he
gashed
the
bird
with
his
knife
and
drank
the
blood
and
then
gave
the
flesh
to
the
dog
while
he
crept
to
the
pool
again
for
another
draught
ah
think
not
reader
that
although
we
have
treated
this
subject
in
a
slight
vein
of
pleasantry
because
it
ended
well
that
therefore
our
tale
is
pure
fiction
not
only
are
indians
glad
to
satisfy
the
urgent
cravings
of
hunger
with
raw
flesh
but
many
civilized
men
and
delicately
nurtured
have
done
the
same
ay
and
doubtless
will
do
the
same
again
as
long
as
enterprising
and
fearless
men
shall
go
forth
to
dare
the
dangers
of
flood
and
field
in
the
wild
places
of
our
wonderful
world
crusoe
had
finished
his
share
of
the
feast
before
dick
returned
from
the
pool
then
master
and
dog
lay
down
together
side
by
side
and
fell
into
a
long
deep
peaceful
slumber

with
a
dick
varley
fears
and
troubles
in
the
meantime
were
ended
on
the
day
following
he
awoke
refreshed
and
happy
so
happy
and
light
at
heart
as
he
felt
the
glow
of
returning
health
coursing
through
his
veins
that
he
fancied
he
must
have
dreamed
it
all
in
fact
he
was
so
certain
that
his
muscles
were
strong
that
he
endeavoured
to
leap
up
but
was
powerfully
convinced
of
his
true
condition
by
the
miserable
stagger
that
resulted
from
the
effort
however
he
knew
he
was
recovering
so
he
rose
and
thanking
god
for
his
recovery
and
for
the
new
hope
that
was
raised
in
his
heart
he
went
down
to
the
pool
and
drank
deeply
of
its
water
then
he
returned
and
sitting
down
beside
his
dog
opened
the
bible
and
read
long
and
for
the
first
time
the
story
of
christ
love
for
sinful
man
he
at
last
fell
asleep
over
the
book
and
when
he
awakened
felt
so
much
refreshed
in
body
and
mind
that
he
determined
to
attempt
to
pursue
his
journey
he
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
came
upon
a
colony
of
upon
this
occasion
he
was
little
inclined
to
take
a
humorous
view
of
the
vagaries
of
these
curious
little
creatures
but
he
shot
one
and
as
before
ate
part
of
it
raw
these
creatures
are
so
active
that
they
are
difficult
to
shoot
and
even
when
killed
generally
fall
into
their
holes
and
disappear
crusoe
however
soon
unearthed
the
dead
animal
on
this
occasion
that
night
the
travellers
came
to
a
stream
of
fresh
water
and
dick
killed
a
turkey
so
that
he
determined
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
there
to
recruit
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
again
set
out
but
was
able
only
to
advance
five
miles
when
he
broke
down
in
fact
it
became
evident
to
him
that
he
must
have
a
longer
period
of
absolute
repose
ere
he
could
hope
to
continue
his
journey
but
to
do
so
without
food
was
impossible
fortunately
there
was
plenty
of
water
as
his
course
lay
along
the
margin
of
a
small
stream
and
as
the
arid
piece
of
prairie
was
now
behind
him
he
hoped
to
fall
in
with
birds
or
perhaps
deer
soon
while
he
was
plodding
heavily
and
wearily
along
pondering
these
things
he
came
to
the
brow
of
a
wave
from
which
he
beheld
a
most
magnificent
view
of
green
grassy
plains
decked
with
flowers
and
rolling
out
to
the
horizon
with
a
stream
meandering
through
it
and
clumps
of
trees
scattered
everywhere
far
and
wide
it
was
a
glorious
sight
but
the
most
glorious
object
in
it
to
dick
at
that
time
was
a
fat
buffalo
which
stood
grazing
not
a
hundred
yards
off
the
wind
was
blowing
towards
him
so
that
the
animal
did
not
scent
him
and
as
he
came
up
very
slowly
and
it
was
turned
away
it
did
not
see
him
crusoe
would
have
sprung
forward
in
an
instant
but
his
finger
imposed
silence
and
caution
trembling
with
eagerness
dick
sank
flat
down
in
the
grass
cocked
both
barrels
of
his
piece
and
resting
it
on
his
left
hand
with
his
left
elbow
on
the
ground
he
waited
until
the
animal
should
present
its
side
in
a
few
seconds
it
moved
dick
eye
glanced
along
the
barrel
but
it
trembled
his
wonted
steadiness
of
aim
was
gone
he
fired
and
the
buffalo
sprang
off
in
terror
with
a
groan
of
despair
he
fired
again
almost
recklessly
and
the
buffalo
fell
it
rose
once
or
twice
and
stumbled
forward
a
few
paces
then
it
fell
again
meanwhile
dick
reloaded
with
trembling
hand
and
advanced
to
give
it
another
shot
but
it
was
not
needful
the
buffalo
was
already
dead
now
crusoe
said
dick
sitting
down
on
the
buffalo
shoulder
and
patting
his
favourite
on
the
head
we
all
right
at
last
you
and
i
shall
have
a
jolly
time
pup
from
this
time
dick
paused
for
breath
and
crusoe
wagged
his
tail
and
looked
as
if
to
say
pshaw
if
we
tell
you
what
it
is
reader
it
of
no
use
at
all
to
go
on
writing
as
if
when
we
tell
you
what
crusoe
said
if
there
is
any
language
in
eyes
whatever
if
there
is
language
in
a
tail
in
a
cocked
ear
in
a
mobile
eyebrow
in
the
point
of
a
canine
nose
if
there
is
language
in
any
terrestrial
thing
at
all
apart
from
that
which
flows
from
the
tongue
then
crusoe
do
we
not
speak
at
this
moment
to
and
if
so
then
tell
me
wherein
lies
the
difference
between
a
written
and
a
given
yes
crusoe
spoke
he
said
to
dick
as
plain
as
dog
could
say
it
slowly
and
emphatically
that
my
opinion
precisely
dick
the
dearest
most
beloved
jolliest
fellow
that
ever
walked
on
two
legs
you
are
and
whatever
your
opinion
is
mine
no
matter
absurd
it
may
be
dick
evidently
understood
him
perfectly
for
he
laughed
as
he
looked
at
him
and
patted
him
on
the
head
and
called
him
a
funny
dog
then
he
continued
his
discourse
yes
pup
we
make
our
camp
here
for
a
long
bit
old
dog
in
this
beautiful
plain
we
make
a
willow
wigwam
to
sleep
in
you
and
i
jist
in
yon
clump
o
trees
not
a
to
our
right
where
we
have
a
run
o
pure
water
beside
us
and
be
near
our
buffalo
at
the
same
time
for
ye
see
we
need
to
watch
him
lest
the
wolves
take
a
notion
to
eat
him
that
be
duty
pup
then
i
skin
him
when
i
get
strong
enough
which
be
in
a
day
or
two
i
hope
and
we
put
of
the
skin
below
us
and
half
above
us
i
the
camp
an
sleep
an
eat
an
take
it
easy
for
a
week
or
two
wo
we
pup
shouted
crusoe
with
a
jovial
wag
of
his
tail
that
no
human
arm
with
hat
or
cap
or
kerchief
ever
equalled
poor
dick
varley
he
smiled
to
think
how
earnestly
he
had
been
talking
to
the
dog
but
he
did
not
cease
to
do
it
for
although
he
entered
into
discourses
the
drift
of
which
crusoe
limited
education
did
not
permit
him
to
follow
he
found
comfort
in
hearing
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
and
in
knowing
that
it
fell
pleasantly
on
another
ear
in
that
lonely
wilderness
our
hero
now
set
about
his
preparations
as
vigorously
as
he
could
he
cut
out
the
buffalo
tongue
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
to
one
in
his
weak
state
and
carried
it
to
a
pleasant
spot
near
to
the
stream
where
the
turf
was
level
and
green
and
decked
with
wild
flowers
here
he
resolved
to
make
his
camp
his
first
care
was
to
select
a
bush
whose
branches
were
long
enough
to
form
a
canopy
over
his
head
when
bent
and
the
ends
thrust
into
the
ground
the
completing
of
this
exhausted
him
greatly
but
after
a
rest
he
resumed
his
labours
the
next
thing
was
to
light
a
fire
a
comfort
which
he
had
not
enjoyed
for
many
weary
days
not
that
he
required
it
for
warmth
for
the
weather
was
extremely
warm
but
he
required
it
to
cook
with
and
the
mere
of
a
blaze
in
a
dark
place
is
a
most
thing
as
every
one
knows
when
the
fire
was
lighted
he
filled
his
pannikin
at
the
brook
and
put
it
on
to
boil
and
cutting
several
slices
of
buffalo
tongue
he
thrust
short
stakes
through
them
and
set
them
up
before
the
fire
to
roast
by
this
time
the
water
was
boiling
so
he
took
it
off
with
difficulty
nearly
burning
his
fingers
and
singeing
the
tail
of
his
coat
in
so
doing
into
the
pannikin
he
put
a
lump
of
maple
sugar
and
stirred
it
about
with
a
stick
and
tasted
it
it
seemed
to
him
even
better
than
tea
or
coffee
it
was
absolutely
delicious
really
one
has
no
notion
what
he
can
do
if
he
makes
believe
the
human
mind
is
a
nicely
balanced
and
extremely
complex
machine
and
when
thrown
a
little
off
the
balance
can
be
made
to
believe
almost
anything
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
some
poor
monomaniacs
who
have
fancied
that
they
were
made
of
all
sorts
of
things
glass
and
porcelain
and
such
like
no
wonder
then
that
poor
dick
varley
after
so
much
suffering
and
hardship
came
to
regard
that
pannikin
of
hot
sirup
as
the
most
delicious
beverage
he
ever
drank
during
all
these
operations
crusoe
sat
on
his
haunches
beside
him
and
looked
and
you
have
no
you
have
got
the
most
distant
notion
of
the
way
in
which
that
dog
manoeuvred
with
his
head
and
face
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
cocked
his
ears
and
turned
his
head
first
a
little
to
one
side
then
a
little
to
the
other
after
that
he
turned
it
a
to
one
side
and
then
a
good
deal
more
to
the
other
then
he
brought
it
straight
and
raised
one
eyebrow
a
little
and
then
the
other
a
little
and
then
both
together
very
much
then
when
dick
paused
to
rest
and
did
nothing
crusoe
looked
mild
for
a
moment
and
yawned
vociferously
presently
dick
moved
up
went
the
ears
again
and
crusoe
came
in
military
parlance
to
the
position
of
attention
at
last
supper
was
ready
and
they
began
dick
had
purposely
kept
the
dog
supper
back
from
him
in
order
that
they
might
eat
it
in
company
and
between
every
bite
and
sup
that
dick
took
he
gave
a
bite
but
not
a
sup
to
crusoe
thus
lovingly
they
ate
together
and
when
dick
lay
that
night
under
the
willow
branches
looking
up
through
them
at
the
stars
with
his
feet
to
the
fire
and
crusoe
close
along
his
side
he
thought
it
the
best
and
sweetest
supper
he
ever
ate
and
the
happiest
evening
he
ever
spent
so
wonderfully
do
circumstances
modify
our
notions
of
felicity
two
weeks
after
this
richard
was
himself
again
the
muscles
were
springy
and
the
blood
coursed
fast
and
free
as
was
its
wont
only
a
slight
and
perhaps
salutary
feeling
of
weakness
remained
to
remind
him
that
young
muscles
might
again
become
more
helpless
than
those
of
an
aged
man
or
a
child
dick
had
left
his
encampment
a
week
ago
and
was
now
advancing
by
rapid
stages
towards
the
rocky
mountains
closely
following
the
trail
of
his
lost
comrades
which
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
and
keeping
now
that
crusoe
was
with
him
the
skin
of
the
buffalo
that
he
had
killed
was
now
strapped
to
his
shoulders
and
the
skin
of
another
animal
that
he
had
shot
a
few
days
after
was
cut
up
into
a
long
line
and
slung
in
a
coil
round
his
neck
crusoe
was
also
laden
he
had
a
little
bundle
of
meat
slung
on
each
side
of
him
for
some
time
past
numerous
herds
of
mustangs
or
wild
horses
had
crossed
their
path
and
dick
was
now
on
the
for
a
chance
to
one
of
those
magnificent
creatures
on
one
occasion
a
band
of
mustangs
galloped
close
up
to
him
before
they
were
aware
of
his
presence
and
stopped
short
with
a
wild
snort
of
surprise
on
beholding
him
then
wheeling
round
they
dashed
away
at
full
gallop
their
long
tails
and
manes
flying
wildly
in
the
air
and
their
hoofs
thundering
on
the
plain
dick
did
not
attempt
to
crease
one
upon
this
occasion
fearing
that
his
recent
illness
might
have
rendered
his
hand
too
unsteady
for
so
extremely
delicate
an
operation
in
order
to
crease
a
wild
horse
the
hunter
requires
to
be
a
perfect
shot
and
it
is
not
every
man
of
the
west
who
carries
a
rifle
that
can
do
it
successfully
creasing
consists
in
sending
a
bullet
through
the
gristle
of
the
mustang
neck
just
above
the
bone
so
as
to
stun
the
animal
if
the
ball
enters
a
too
low
the
horse
falls
dead
instantly
if
it
hits
the
exact
spot
the
horse
falls
as
instantaneously
and
dead
to
all
appearance
but
in
reality
he
is
only
stunned
and
if
left
for
a
few
minutes
will
rise
and
gallop
away
nearly
as
well
as
ever
when
hunters
crease
a
horse
successfully
they
put
a
rope
or
halter
round
his
under
jaw
and
hobbles
round
his
feet
so
that
when
he
rises
he
is
secured
and
after
considerable
trouble
reduced
to
obedience
the
mustangs
which
roam
in
wild
freedom
on
the
prairies
of
the
far
west
are
descended
from
the
noble
spanish
steeds
that
were
brought
over
by
the
wealthy
cavaliers
who
accompanied
fernando
cortez
the
conqueror
of
mexico
in
his
expedition
to
the
new
world
in
these
bold
and
we
may
add
lawless
cavaliers
were
mounted
on
the
finest
horses
that
could
be
procured
from
barbary
and
the
deserts
of
the
old
world
the
poor
indians
of
the
new
world
were
struck
with
amazement
and
terror
at
these
awful
beings
for
never
having
seen
horses
before
they
believed
that
horse
and
rider
were
one
animal
during
the
wars
that
followed
many
of
the
spaniards
were
killed
and
their
steeds
bounded
into
the
wilds
of
the
new
country
to
enjoy
a
life
of
unrestrained
freedom
these
were
the
forefathers
of
the
present
race
of
magnificent
creatures
which
are
found
in
immense
droves
all
over
the
western
wilderness
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
the
confines
of
the
snowy
regions
of
the
far
north
at
first
the
indians
beheld
these
horses
with
awe
and
terror
but
gradually
they
became
accustomed
to
them
and
finally
succeeded
in
capturing
great
numbers
and
reducing
them
to
a
state
of
servitude
not
however
to
the
service
of
the
cultivated
field
but
to
the
service
of
the
chase
and
war
the
savages
soon
acquired
the
method
of
capturing
wild
horses
by
means
of
the
lasso
as
the
noose
at
that
end
of
a
long
line
of
raw
hide
is
termed
which
they
adroitly
threw
over
the
heads
of
the
animals
and
secured
them
having
previously
run
them
down
at
the
present
day
many
of
the
savage
tribes
of
the
west
almost
live
upon
horseback
and
without
these
useful
creatures
they
could
scarcely
subsist
as
they
are
almost
indispensable
in
the
chase
of
the
buffalo
mustangs
are
regularly
taken
by
the
indians
to
the
settlements
of
the
white
men
for
trade
but
very
poor
specimens
are
these
of
the
breed
of
wild
horses
this
arises
from
two
causes
first
the
indian
can
not
overtake
the
finest
of
a
drove
of
wild
mustangs
because
his
own
steed
is
inferior
to
the
best
among
the
wild
ones
besides
being
weighted
with
a
rider
so
that
only
the
weak
and
inferior
animals
are
captured
and
secondly
when
the
indian
does
succeed
in
lassoing
a
horse
he
keeps
it
for
his
own
use
thus
those
who
have
not
visited
the
prairies
and
seen
the
mustang
in
all
the
glory
of
untrammelled
freedom
can
form
no
adequate
idea
of
its
beauty
fleetness
and
strength
the
horse
however
was
not
the
only
creature
imported
by
cortez
there
were
priests
in
his
army
who
rode
upon
asses
and
although
we
can
not
imagine
that
the
fathers
charged
with
the
cavaliers
and
were
unhorsed
or
rather
in
battle
yet
somehow
the
asses
got
rid
of
their
riders
and
joined
the
spanish
chargers
in
their
joyous
bound
into
a
new
life
of
freedom
hence
wild
asses
also
are
found
in
the
western
prairies
but
think
not
reader
of
those
poor
miserable
wretches
we
see
at
home
which
seem
little
better
than
rough
sewed
up
and
stuffed
with
head
tail
and
legs
attached
and
just
enough
of
life
infused
to
make
them
move
no
the
wild
ass
of
the
prairie
is
a
large
powerful
swift
creature
he
has
the
same
long
ears
it
is
true
and
the
same
hideous
exasperating
bray
and
the
same
tendency
to
flourish
his
heels
but
for
all
that
he
is
a
very
fine
animal
and
often
wages
warfare
with
the
wild
horse
but
to
return
the
next
drove
of
mustangs
that
dick
and
crusoe
saw
were
feeding
quietly
and
unsuspectingly
in
a
rich
green
hollow
in
the
plain
dick
heart
leaped
up
as
his
eyes
suddenly
fell
on
them
for
he
had
almost
discovered
himself
before
he
was
aware
of
their
presence
down
pup
he
whispered
as
he
sank
and
disappeared
among
the
grass
which
was
just
long
enough
to
cover
him
when
lying
quite
flat
crusoe
crouched
immediately
and
his
master
made
his
observations
of
the
drove
and
the
dispositions
of
the
ground
that
might
favour
his
approach
for
they
were
not
within
rifle
range
having
done
so
he
crept
slowly
back
until
the
undulation
of
the
prairie
hid
him
from
view
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
a
considerable
distance
along
the
bottom
until
he
gained
the
extreme
end
of
a
belt
of
low
bushes
which
would
effectually
conceal
him
while
he
approached
to
within
a
hundred
yards
or
less
of
the
troop
here
he
made
his
arrangements
throwing
down
his
buffalo
robe
he
took
the
coil
of
line
and
cut
off
a
piece
of
about
three
yards
in
length
on
this
he
made
a
running
noose
the
longer
line
he
also
prepared
with
a
running
noose
these
he
threw
in
a
coil
over
his
arm
he
also
made
a
pair
of
hobbles
and
placed
them
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
then
taking
up
his
rifle
advanced
cautiously
through
the
bushes
crusoe
following
close
behind
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
gazing
in
admiration
at
the
mustangs
which
were
now
within
easy
shot
and
utterly
ignorant
of
the
presence
of
man
for
dick
had
taken
care
to
approach
in
such
a
way
that
the
wind
did
not
carry
the
scent
of
him
in
their
direction
and
well
might
he
admire
them
the
wild
horse
of
these
regions
is
not
very
large
but
it
is
exceedingly
powerful
with
prominent
eye
sharp
nose
distended
nostril
small
feet
and
a
delicate
leg
their
beautiful
manes
hung
at
great
length
down
their
arched
necks
and
their
thick
tails
swept
the
ground
one
magnificent
fellow
in
particular
attracted
dick
attention
he
was
of
a
rich
colour
with
black
mane
and
tail
and
seemed
to
be
the
leader
of
the
drove
although
not
the
nearest
to
him
he
resolved
to
crease
this
horse
it
is
said
that
creasing
generally
destroys
or
damages
the
spirit
of
the
horse
so
dick
determined
to
try
whether
his
powers
of
close
shooting
would
not
serve
him
on
this
occasion
going
down
on
one
knee
he
aimed
at
the
creature
neck
just
a
above
the
spot
where
he
had
been
told
that
hunters
usually
hit
them
and
fired
the
effect
upon
the
group
was
absolutely
tremendous
with
wild
cries
and
snorting
terror
they
tossed
their
proud
heads
in
the
air
uncertain
for
one
moment
in
which
direction
to
fly
then
there
was
a
rush
as
if
a
hurricane
swept
over
the
place
and
they
were
gone
but
the
brown
horse
was
down
dick
did
not
wait
until
the
others
had
fled
he
dropped
his
rifle
and
with
the
speed
of
a
deer
sprang
towards
the
fallen
horse
and
affixed
the
hobbles
to
his
legs
his
aim
had
been
true
although
scarcely
half
a
minute
elapsed
between
the
shot
and
the
fixing
of
the
hobbles
the
animal
recovered
and
with
a
frantic
exertion
rose
on
his
haunches
just
as
dick
had
fastened
the
noose
of
the
short
line
in
his
under
jaw
but
this
was
not
enough
if
the
horse
had
gained
his
feet
before
the
longer
line
was
placed
round
his
neck
he
would
have
escaped
as
the
mustang
made
the
second
violent
plunge
that
placed
it
on
its
legs
dick
flung
the
noose
hastily
it
caught
on
one
ear
and
would
have
fallen
off
had
not
the
horse
suddenly
shaken
its
head
and
unwittingly
sealed
its
own
fate
by
bringing
the
noose
round
its
neck
and
now
the
struggle
began
dick
knew
well
enough
from
hearsay
the
method
of
breaking
down
a
wild
horse
he
knew
that
the
indians
choke
them
with
the
noose
round
the
neck
until
they
fall
down
exhausted
and
covered
with
foam
when
they
creep
up
fix
the
hobbles
and
the
line
in
the
lower
jaw
and
then
loosen
the
lasso
to
let
the
horse
breathe
and
resume
its
plungings
till
it
is
almost
subdued
when
they
gradually
draw
near
and
breathe
into
its
nostrils
but
the
violence
and
strength
of
this
animal
rendered
this
an
apparently
hopeless
task
we
have
already
seen
that
the
hobbles
and
noose
in
the
lower
jaw
had
been
fixed
so
that
dick
had
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
choke
his
captive
and
tire
him
out
while
crusoe
remained
a
quiet
though
excited
spectator
of
the
scene
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
possibility
of
choking
this
horse
either
the
muscles
of
his
neck
were
too
strong
or
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
noose
which
prevented
it
from
acting
for
the
furious
creature
dashed
and
bounded
backwards
and
sideways
in
its
terror
for
nearly
an
hour
dragging
dick
after
it
till
he
was
almost
exhausted
and
yet
at
the
end
of
that
time
although
flecked
with
foam
and
panting
with
terror
it
seemed
as
strong
as
ever
dick
held
both
lines
for
the
short
one
attached
to
its
lower
jaw
gave
him
great
power
over
it
at
last
he
thought
of
seeking
assistance
from
his
dog
crusoe
he
cried
lay
hold
pup
the
dog
seized
the
long
line
in
his
teeth
and
pulled
with
all
his
might
at
the
same
moment
dick
let
go
the
short
line
and
threw
all
his
weight
upon
the
long
one
the
noose
tightened
suddenly
under
this
strain
and
the
mustang
with
a
gasp
fell
choking
to
the
ground
dick
had
often
heard
of
the
manner
in
which
the
mexicans
break
their
horses
so
he
determined
to
abandon
the
method
which
had
already
almost
worn
him
out
and
adopt
the
other
as
far
as
the
means
in
his
power
rendered
it
possible
instead
therefore
of
loosening
the
lasso
and
the
struggle
he
tore
a
branch
from
a
neighbouring
bush
cut
the
hobbles
strode
with
his
legs
across
the
fallen
steed
seized
the
end
of
the
short
line
or
bridle
and
then
ordering
crusoe
to
quit
his
hold
he
loosened
the
noose
which
compressed
the
neck
and
had
already
terminated
its
existence
one
or
two
deep
sobs
restored
it
and
in
a
moment
it
leaped
to
its
feet
with
dick
firmly
on
its
back
to
say
that
the
animal
leaped
and
kicked
in
its
frantic
efforts
to
throw
this
intolerable
burden
would
be
a
tame
manner
of
expressing
what
took
place
words
can
not
adequately
describe
the
scene
it
reared
plunged
shrieked
vaulted
into
the
air
stood
straight
up
on
its
hind
legs
and
then
almost
as
straight
upon
its
fore
ones
but
its
rider
held
on
like
a
burr
then
the
mustang
raced
wildly
forwards
a
few
paces
then
as
wildly
back
and
then
stood
still
and
trembled
violently
but
this
was
only
a
brief
lull
in
the
storm
so
dick
saw
that
the
time
was
now
come
to
assert
the
superiority
of
his
race
stay
back
crusoe
and
watch
my
rifle
pup
he
cried
and
raising
his
heavy
switch
he
brought
it
down
with
a
sharp
cut
across
the
horse
flank
at
the
same
time
loosening
the
rein
which
hitherto
he
had
held
tight
the
wild
horse
uttered
a
passionate
cry
and
sprang
forward
like
the
bolt
from
a
and
now
commenced
a
race
which
if
not
so
prolonged
was
at
least
as
furious
as
that
of
the
mazeppa
dick
was
a
splendid
rider
however
at
least
as
far
as
sticking
on
goes
he
might
not
have
come
up
to
the
precise
pitch
desiderated
by
a
in
regard
to
carriage
but
he
rode
that
wild
horse
of
the
prairie
with
as
much
ease
as
he
had
formerly
ridden
his
own
good
steed
whose
bones
had
been
picked
by
the
wolves
not
long
ago
the
pace
was
tremendous
for
the
youth
weight
was
nothing
to
that
muscular
frame
which
bounded
with
agility
from
wave
to
wave
of
the
undulating
plain
in
ungovernable
terror
in
a
few
minutes
the
clump
of
willows
where
crusoe
and
his
rifle
lay
were
out
of
sight
behind
but
it
mattered
not
for
dick
had
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
noted
the
position
of
the
sun
at
the
moment
of
starting
away
they
went
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
mile
after
mile
over
the
waste
curving
slightly
aside
now
and
then
to
avoid
the
bluffs
that
occasionally
appeared
on
the
scene
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
swept
out
of
sight
behind
them
then
they
came
to
a
little
rivulet
it
was
a
mere
brook
of
a
few
feet
wide
and
two
or
three
yards
perhaps
from
bank
to
bank
over
this
they
flew
so
easily
that
the
spring
was
scarcely
felt
and
continued
the
headlong
course
and
now
a
more
barren
country
was
around
them
sandy
ridges
and
scrubby
grass
appeared
everywhere
reminding
dick
of
the
place
where
he
had
been
so
ill
rocks
too
were
scattered
about
and
at
one
place
the
horse
dashed
with
clattering
hoofs
between
a
couple
of
rocky
which
for
a
few
seconds
hid
the
prairie
from
view
here
the
mustang
suddenly
shied
with
such
violence
that
his
rider
was
nearly
thrown
while
a
rattlesnake
darted
from
the
path
soon
they
emerged
from
this
pass
and
again
the
plains
became
green
and
verdant
presently
a
distant
line
of
trees
showed
that
they
were
approaching
water
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
close
on
it
for
the
first
time
dick
felt
alarm
he
sought
to
check
his
steed
but
no
force
he
could
exert
had
the
smallest
influence
on
it
trees
and
bushes
flew
past
in
bewildering
confusion
the
river
was
before
him
what
width
he
could
not
tell
but
he
was
reckless
now
like
his
charger
which
he
struck
with
the
willow
rod
with
all
his
force
as
they
came
up
one
tremendous
bound
and
they
were
across
but
dick
had
to
lie
flat
on
the
mustang
back
as
it
crashed
through
the
bushes
to
avoid
being
scraped
off
by
the
trees
again
they
were
on
the
open
plain
and
the
wild
horse
began
to
show
signs
of
exhaustion
now
was
its
rider
opportunity
to
assert
his
dominion
he
plied
the
willow
rod
and
urged
the
panting
horse
on
until
it
was
white
with
foam
and
laboured
a
little
in
its
gait
then
dick
gently
drew
the
halter
and
it
broke
into
a
trot
still
tighter
and
it
walked
and
in
another
minute
stood
still
trembling
in
every
limb
dick
now
quietly
rubbed
its
neck
and
spoke
to
it
in
soothing
tones
then
he
wheeled
it
gently
round
and
urged
it
forward
it
was
quite
subdued
and
docile
in
a
little
time
they
came
to
the
river
and
forded
it
after
which
they
went
through
the
belt
of
woodland
at
a
walk
by
the
time
they
reached
the
open
prairie
the
mustang
was
recovered
sufficiently
to
feel
its
spirit
returning
so
dick
gave
it
a
gentle
touch
with
the
switch
and
away
they
went
on
their
return
journey
but
it
amazed
dick
not
a
little
to
find
how
long
that
journey
was
very
different
was
the
pace
too
from
the
previous
mad
gallop
and
often
would
the
poor
horse
have
stopped
had
dick
allowed
him
but
this
might
not
be
the
shades
of
night
were
approaching
and
the
camp
lay
a
long
way
ahead
at
last
it
was
reached
and
crusoe
came
out
with
great
demonstrations
of
joy
but
was
sent
back
lest
he
should
alarm
the
horse
then
dick
jumped
off
his
back
stroked
his
head
put
his
cheek
close
to
his
mouth
and
whispered
softly
to
him
after
which
he
fastened
him
to
a
tree
and
rubbed
him
down
slightly
with
a
bunch
of
grass
having
done
this
he
left
him
to
graze
as
far
as
his
tether
would
permit
and
after
supping
with
crusoe
lay
down
not
a
little
elated
with
his
success
in
this
first
attempt
at
creasing
and
breaking

mustang

had
we
been
at

side
of
dick
varley
on

night
after

the

horse
we
would
have
strongly
urged
that

upon
him
whether

reader
if

tell

why

would
have
listened
to
that

can
a
man
feel
as
if
his
joints
were
wrenched
out
of
their
sockets
and
listen
to
advice
be
that
advice
good
or

can
he
feel
as

were
trying
to

down
at

and

but
no
why
pursue
the
subject
poor
dick
spent
that
night
in
misery
and
the
greater
part
of
the
following
day
in
sleep
to
make
up
for
it
when
he
got
up
to
breakfast
in
the
afternoon
he
felt
much
better
but
shaky
now
pup
he
said
stretching
himself
we
go
and
see
our
horse
pup
yours
and
mine
did
you
help
to
catch
him
eh
pup
crusoe
acknowledged
the
fact
with
a
wag
and
a
playful
and
followed
his
master
to
the
place
where
the
horse
had
been
picketed
it
was
standing
there
quite
quiet
but
looking
a
little
timid
dick
went
boldly
up
to
it
and
patted
its
head
and
stroked
its
nose
for
nothing
is
so
likely
to
alarm
either
a
tame
or
a
wild
horse
as
any
appearance
of
timidity
or
hesitation
on
the
part
of
those
who
approach
them
after
treating
it
thus
for
a
short
time
he
stroked
down
its
neck
and
then
its
shoulders
the
horse
eying
him
all
the
time
nervously
gradually
he
stroked
its
back
and
limbs
gently
and
walked
quietly
round
and
round
it
once
or
twice
sometimes
approaching
and
sometimes
going
away
but
never
either
hesitating
or
doing
anything
abruptly
this
done
he
went
down
to
the
stream
and
filled
his
cap
with
water
and
carried
it
to
the
horse
which
snuffed
suspiciously
and
backed
a
little
so
he
laid
the
cap
down
and
went
up
and
patted
him
again
presently
he
took
up
the
cap
and
carried
it
to
his
nose
the
poor
creature
was
almost
choking
with
thirst
so
that
the
moment
he
understood
what
was
in
the
cap
he
buried
his
lips
in
it
and
sucked
it
up
this
was
a
great
point
gained
he
had
accepted
a
benefit
at
the
hands
of
his
new
master
he
had
become
a
debtor
to
man
and
no
doubt
he
felt
the
obligation
dick
filled
the
cap
and
the
horse
emptied
it
again
and
again
and
again
until
its
burning
thirst
was
slaked
then
dick
went
up
to
his
shoulder
patted
him
undid
the
line
that
fastened
him
and
vaulted
lightly
on
his
back
we
say
for
it
was
so
but
it
was
as
dick
could
have
told
you
however
he
was
determined
not
to
forego
the
training
of
his
steed
on
account
of
what
would
have
called
a
little
bit
pain
at
this
unexpected
act
the
horse
plunged
and
reared
a
good
deal
and
seemed
inclined
to
go
through
the
performance
of
the
day
before
over
again
but
dick
patted
and
stroked
him
into
quiescence
and
having
done
so
urged
him
into
a
gallop
over
the
plains
causing
the
dog
to
gambol
round
in
order
that
he
might
get
accustomed
to
him
this
tried
his
nerves
a
good
deal
and
no
wonder
for
if
he
took
crusoe
for
a
wolf
which
no
doubt
he
did
he
must
have
thought
him
a
very
giant
of
the
pack
by
degrees
they
broke
into
a
furious
gallop
and
after
breathing
him
well
dick
returned
and
tied
him
to
the
tree
then
he
rubbed
him
down
again
and
gave
him
another
drink
this
time
the
horse
smelt
his
new
master
all
over
and
dick
felt
that
he
had
conquered
him
by
kindness
no
doubt
the
tremendous
run
of
the
day
before
could
scarcely
be
called
kindness
but
without
this
subduing
run
he
never
could
have
brought
the
offices
of
kindness
to
bear
on
so
wild
a
steed
during
all
these
operations
crusoe
sat
looking
on
with
demure
sagacity
drinking
in
wisdom
and
taking
notes
we
know
not
whether
any
notes
made
by
the
canine
race
have
ever
been
given
to
the
world
but
certain
are
we
that
if
the
notes
and
observations
made
by
crusoe
on
that
journey
were
published
they
would
to
say
the
least
surprise
us
next
day
dick
gave
the
wild
horse
his
second
lesson
and
his
name
he
called
him
charlie
after
a
companion
in
the
mustang
valley
and
long
and
heartily
did
dick
varley
laugh
as
he
told
the
horse
his
future
designation
in
the
presence
of
crusoe
for
it
struck
him
as
somewhat
ludicrous
that
a
mustang
which
two
days
ago
pawed
the
earth
in
all
the
pride
of
independent
freedom
should
suddenly
come
down
so
low
as
to
carry
a
hunter
on
his
back
and
be
named
charlie
the
next
piece
of
instruction
began
by
crusoe
being
led
up
under
charlie
nose
and
while
dick
patted
the
dog
with
his
right
hand
he
patted
the
horse
with
his
left
it
backed
a
good
deal
at
first
and
snorted
but
crusoe
walked
slowly
and
quietly
in
front
of
him
several
times
each
time
coming
nearer
until
he
again
stood
under
his
nose
then
the
horse
smelt
him
nervously
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
found
that
crusoe
paid
no
attention
to
him
whatever
dick
then
ordered
the
dog
to
lie
down
at
charlie
feet
and
went
to
the
camp
to
fetch
his
rifle
and
buffalo
robe
and
pack
of
meat
these
and
all
the
other
things
belonging
to
him
were
presented
for
inspection
one
by
one
to
the
horse
who
arched
his
neck
and
put
forward
his
ears
and
eyed
them
at
first
but
smelt
them
all
over
and
seemed
to
feel
more
easy
in
his
mind
next
the
buffalo
robe
was
rubbed
over
his
nose
then
over
his
eyes
and
head
then
down
his
neck
and
shoulder
and
lastly
was
placed
on
his
back
then
it
was
taken
off
and
on
after
that
it
was
strapped
on
and
the
various
little
items
of
the
camp
were
attached
to
it
this
done
dick
took
up
his
rifle
and
let
him
smell
it
then
he
put
his
hand
on
charlie
shoulder
vaulted
on
to
his
back
and
rode
away
charlie
education
was
completed
and
now
our
hero
journey
began
again
in
earnest
and
with
some
prospect
of
its
speedy
termination
in
this
course
of
training
through
which
dick
put
his
wild
horse
he
had
been
at
much
greater
pains
and
had
taken
far
longer
time
than
is
usually
the
case
among
the
indians
who
will
catch
and
break
and
ride
a
wild
horse
into
camp
in
less
than
but
dick
wanted
to
do
the
thing
well
which
the
indians
are
not
careful
to
do
besides
it
must
be
borne
in
remembrance
that
this
was
his
first
attempt
and
that
his
horse
was
one
of
the
best
and
most
while
those
caught
by
the
indians
as
we
have
said
are
generally
the
poorest
of
a
drove
dick
now
followed
the
trail
of
his
lost
companions
at
a
rapid
pace
yet
not
so
rapidly
as
he
might
have
done
being
averse
to
exhausting
his
good
dog
and
his
new
companion
each
night
he
encamped
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
or
a
bush
when
he
could
find
one
or
in
the
open
prairie
when
there
were
none
and
picketing
his
horse
to
a
short
stake
or
pin
which
he
carried
with
him
for
the
purpose
lit
his
fire
had
supper
and
lay
down
to
rest
in
a
few
days
charlie
became
so
tame
and
so
accustomed
to
his
master
voice
that
he
seemed
quite
reconciled
to
his
new
life
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
had
a
great
dislike
to
solitude
for
on
one
occasion
when
dick
and
crusoe
went
off
a
mile
or
so
from
the
camp
where
charlie
was
tied
and
disappeared
from
his
view
he
was
heard
to
neigh
so
loudly
that
dick
ran
back
thinking
the
wolves
must
have
attacked
him
he
was
all
right
however
and
exhibited
evident
tokens
of
satisfaction
when
they
returned
on
another
occasion
his
fear
of
being
left
alone
was
more
clearly
demonstrated
dick
had
been
unable
to
find
wood
or
water
that
day
so
he
was
obliged
to
encamp
upon
the
open
plain
the
want
of
water
was
not
seriously
felt
however
for
he
had
prepared
a
bladder
in
which
he
always
carried
enough
to
give
him
one
pannikin
of
hot
sirup
and
leave
a
mouthful
for
crusoe
and
charlie
dried
buffalo
dung
formed
a
substitute
for
fuel
spreading
his
buffalo
robe
he
lit
his
fire
put
on
his
pannikin
to
boil
and
stuck
up
a
piece
of
meat
to
roast
to
the
great
delight
of
crusoe
who
sat
looking
on
with
much
interest
suddenly
charlie
who
was
picketed
a
few
hundred
yards
off
in
a
grassy
spot
broke
his
halter
close
by
the
headpiece
and
with
a
snort
of
delight
bounded
away
prancing
and
kicking
up
his
heels
dick
heaved
a
deep
sigh
for
he
felt
sure
that
his
horse
was
gone
however
in
a
little
charlie
stopped
and
raised
his
nose
high
in
the
air
as
if
to
look
for
his
old
equine
companions
but
they
were
gone
no
answering
neigh
replied
to
his
and
he
felt
probably
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
really
alone
in
the
world
having
no
power
of
smell
whereby
he
might
have
traced
them
out
as
the
dog
would
have
done
he
looked
in
a
bewildered
and
excited
state
all
round
the
horizon
then
his
eye
fell
on
dick
and
crusoe
sitting
by
their
little
fire
charlie
looked
hard
at
them
and
then
again
at
the
horizon
and
then
coming
to
the
conclusion
no
doubt
that
the
matter
was
quite
beyond
his
comprehension
he
quietly
took
to
feeding
dick
availed
himself
of
the
chance
and
tried
to
catch
him
but
he
spent
an
hour
with
crusoe
in
the
vain
attempt
and
at
last
they
gave
it
up
in
disgust
and
returned
to
the
fire
where
they
finished
their
supper
and
went
to
bed
next
morning
they
saw
charlie
feeding
close
at
hand
so
they
took
breakfast
and
tried
to
catch
him
again
but
it
was
of
no
use
he
was
evidently
coquetting
with
them
and
dodged
about
and
defied
their
utmost
efforts
for
there
were
only
a
few
inches
of
line
hanging
to
his
head
at
last
it
occurred
to
dick
that
he
would
try
the
experiment
of
forsaking
him
so
he
packed
up
his
things
rolled
up
the
buffalo
robe
threw
it
and
the
rifle
on
his
shoulder
and
walked
deliberately
away
come
along
crusoe
he
cried
after
walking
a
few
paces
but
crusoe
stood
by
the
fire
with
his
head
up
and
an
expression
on
his
face
that
said
hallo
man
what
wrong
you
forgot
charlie
hold
on
are
you
mad
come
here
crusoe
cried
his
master
in
a
decided
tone
crusoe
obeyed
at
once
whatever
mistake
there
might
be
there
was
evidently
none
in
that
command
so
he
lowered
his
head
and
tail
humbly
and
trotted
on
with
his
master
but
he
perpetually
turned
his
head
as
he
went
first
on
this
side
and
then
on
that
to
look
and
wonder
at
charlie
when
they
were
far
away
on
the
plain
charlie
suddenly
became
aware
that
something
was
wrong
he
trotted
to
the
brow
of
a
slope
with
his
head
and
tail
very
high
up
indeed
and
looked
after
them
then
he
looked
at
the
fire
and
neighed
then
he
trotted
quickly
up
to
it
and
seeing
that
everything
was
gone
he
began
to
neigh
violently
and
at
last
started
off
at
full
speed
and
overtook
his
friends
passing
within
a
few
feet
of
them
and
wheeling
round
a
few
yards
off
stood
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
dick
called
him
by
his
name
and
advanced
while
charlie
met
him
and
allowed
himself
to
be
saddled
bridled
and
mounted
forthwith
after
this
dick
had
no
further
trouble
with
his
wild
horse
at
his
next
which
was
in
the
midst
of
a
cluster
of
bushes
close
beside
a
creek
dick
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
little
wooden
cross
which
marked
the
head
of
a
grave
there
was
no
inscription
on
it
but
the
christian
symbol
told
that
it
was
the
grave
of
a
white
man
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
rush
of
mingled
feelings
that
filled
the
soul
of
the
young
hunter
as
he
leaned
on
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
and
looked
at
this
solitary
of
one
who
doubtless
like
himself
had
been
a
roving
hunter
had
he
been
young
or
old
when
he
fell
had
he
a
mother
in
the
distant
settlement
who
watched
and
longed
and
waited
for
the
son
that
was
never
more
to
gladden
her
eyes
had
he
been
murdered
or
had
he
died
there
and
been
buried
by
his
sorrowing
comrades
these
and
a
thousand
questions
passed
rapidly
through
his
mind
as
he
gazed
at
the
little
cross
suddenly
he
started
could
it
be
the
grave
of
joe
or
henri
for
an
instant
the
idea
sent
a
chill
to
his
heart
but
it
passed
quickly
for
a
second
glance
showed
that
the
grave
was
old
and
that
the
wooden
cross
had
stood
over
it
for
years
dick
turned
away
with
a
saddened
heart
and
that
night
as
he
pored
over
the
pages
of
his
bible
his
mind
was
filled
with
many
thoughts
about
eternity
and
the
world
to
come
he
too
must
come
to
the
grave
one
day
and
quit
the
beautiful
prairies
and
his
loved
rifle
it
was
a
sad
thought
but
while
he
meditated
he
thought
upon
his
mother
after
all
he
murmured
there
must
be
happiness
the
rifle
and
youth
and
health
and
the
prairie
my
mother
happy
yet
she
shoot
or
ride
like
over
the
plains
then
that
word
which
had
been
sent
so
sweetly
to
him
through
her
hand
came
again
to
his
mind
my
son
give
me
thine
heart
and
as
he
read
god
book
he
met
with
the
word
delight
thyself
in
the
lord
and
he
shall
give
thee
the
desire
of
thine
heart
desire
of
thine
dick
repeated
this
and
pondered
it
till
he
fell
asleep
a
misfortune
soon
after
this
befell
dick
varley
which
caused
him
to
give
way
to
despair
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
approaching
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
rocky
mountains
those
ragged
jagged
mighty
hills
which
run
through
the
whole
continent
from
north
to
south
in
a
continuous
chain
and
form
as
it
were
the
backbone
of
america
one
morning
as
he
threw
the
buffalo
robe
off
his
shoulders
and
sat
up
he
was
horrified
to
find
the
whole
earth
covered
with
a
mantle
of
snow
we
say
he
was
horrified
for
this
rendered
it
absolutely
impossible
any
further
to
trace
his
companions
either
by
scent
or
sight
for
some
time
he
sat
musing
bitterly
on
his
sad
fate
while
his
dog
came
and
laid
his
head
sympathizingly
on
his
arm
ah
pup
he
said
i
know
ye
help
me
if
ye
could
but
it
all
up
now
there
no
chance
of
findin
them
none
to
this
crusoe
replied
by
a
low
whine
he
knew
full
well
that
something
distressed
his
master
but
he
had
yet
ascertained
what
it
was
as
something
had
to
be
done
dick
put
the
buffalo
robe
on
his
steed
and
mounting
said
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
each
morning
lead
on
pup
crusoe
put
his
nose
to
the
ground
and
ran
forward
a
few
paces
then
he
returned
and
ran
about
snuffing
and
scraping
up
the
snow
at
last
he
looked
up
and
uttered
a
long
melancholy
howl
ah
i
knowed
it
said
dick
pushing
forward
come
on
pup
have
to
now
any
way
we
must
go
on
the
snow
that
had
fallen
was
not
deep
enough
to
offer
the
slightest
obstruction
to
their
advance
it
was
indeed
only
one
of
those
occasional
showers
common
to
that
part
of
the
country
in
the
late
autumn
which
season
had
now
crept
upon
dick
almost
before
he
was
aware
of
it
and
he
fully
expected
that
it
would
melt
away
in
a
few
days
in
this
hope
he
kept
steadily
advancing
until
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
those
rocky
fastnesses
which
divide
the
waters
that
flow
into
the
atlantic
from
those
that
flow
into
the
pacific
ocean
still
the
slight
crust
of
snow
lay
on
the
ground
and
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
whether
he
was
going
in
the
right
direction
or
not
game
was
abundant
and
there
was
no
lack
of
wood
now
so
that
his
night
bivouac
was
not
so
cold
or
dreary
as
might
have
been
expected
travelling
however
had
become
difficult
and
even
dangerous
owing
to
the
rugged
nature
of
the
ground
over
which
he
proceeded
the
scenery
had
completely
changed
in
its
character
dick
no
longer
coursed
over
the
free
open
plains
but
he
passed
through
beautiful
valleys
filled
with
luxuriant
trees
and
hemmed
in
by
stupendous
mountains
whose
rugged
sides
rose
upward
until
the
peaks
pierced
the
clouds
there
was
something
awful
in
these
dark
solitudes
quite
overwhelming
to
a
youth
of
dick
temperament
his
heart
began
to
sink
lower
and
lower
every
day
and
the
utter
impossibility
of
making
up
his
mind
what
to
do
became
at
length
agonizing
to
have
turned
and
gone
back
the
hundreds
of
miles
over
which
he
had
travelled
would
have
caused
him
some
anxiety
under
any
circumstances
but
to
do
so
while
joe
and
henri
were
either
wandering
about
there
or
in
the
power
of
the
savages
was
he
felt
out
of
the
question
yet
in
which
way
should
he
go
whatever
course
he
took
might
lead
him
farther
and
farther
away
from
them
in
this
dilemma
he
came
to
the
determination
of
remaining
where
he
was
at
least
until
the
snow
should
leave
the
ground
he
felt
great
relief
even
when
this
hopeless
course
was
decided
upon
and
set
about
making
himself
an
encampment
with
some
degree
of
cheerfulness
when
he
had
completed
this
task
he
took
his
rifle
and
leaving
charlie
picketed
in
the
centre
of
a
dell
where
the
long
rich
grass
rose
high
above
the
snow
went
off
to
hunt
on
turning
a
rocky
point
his
heart
suddenly
bounded
into
his
throat
for
there
not
thirty
yards
distant
stood
a
huge
grizzly
bear
yes
there
he
was
at
last
the
monster
to
meet
which
the
young
hunter
had
so
often
longed
the
terrible
size
and
fierceness
of
which
he
had
heard
so
often
spoken
about
by
the
old
hunters
there
it
stood
at
last
but
little
did
dick
varley
think
that
the
first
time
he
should
meet
with
his
foe
should
be
when
alone
in
the
dark
recesses
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
with
none
to
succour
him
in
the
event
of
the
battle
going
against
him
yes
there
was
one
the
faithful
crusoe
stood
by
his
side
with
his
hair
bristling
all
his
formidable
teeth
exposed
and
his
eyes
glaring
in
their
sockets
alas
for
poor
crusoe
had
he
gone
into
that
combat
alone
one
stroke
of
that
monster
paw
would
have
hurled
him
dead
upon
the
ground
chapter
xvii
first
fight
with
a
with
a
there
is
no
animal
in
all
the
land
so
terrible
and
dangerous
as
the
grizzly
bear
not
only
is
he
the
largest
of
the
species
in
america
but
he
is
the
fiercest
the
strongest
and
the
most
tenacious
of
life
facts
which
are
so
well
understood
that
few
of
the
western
hunters
like
to
meet
him
unless
they
happen
to
be
shots
and
the
indians
deem
the
encounter
so
dangerous
that
to
wear
a
collar
composed
of
the
claws
of
a
grizzly
bear
of
his
own
killing
is
counted
one
of
the
highest
honours
to
which
a
young
warrior
can
attain
the
grizzly
bear
resembles
the
brown
bear
of
europe
but
it
is
larger
and
the
hair
is
long
the
points
being
of
a
paler
shade
about
the
head
there
is
a
considerable
mixture
of
gray
hair
giving
it
the
grizzly
appearance
from
which
it
derives
its
name
the
claws
are
dirty
white
arched
and
very
long
and
so
strong
that
when
the
animal
strikes
with
its
paw
they
cut
like
a
chisel
these
claws
are
not
embedded
in
the
paw
as
is
the
case
with
the
cat
but
always
project
far
beyond
the
hair
thus
giving
to
the
foot
a
very
ungainly
appearance
they
are
not
sufficiently
curved
to
enable
the
grizzly
bear
to
climb
trees
like
the
black
and
brown
bears
and
this
inability
on
their
part
is
often
the
only
hope
of
the
pursued
hunter
who
if
he
succeeds
in
ascending
a
tree
is
safe
for
the
time
at
least
from
the
bear
assaults
but
caleb
is
a
patient
creature
and
will
often
wait
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
for
many
hours
for
his
victim
the
average
length
of
his
body
is
about
nine
feet
but
he
sometimes
attains
to
a
still
larger
growth
caleb
is
more
carnivorous
in
his
habits
than
other
bears
but
like
them
he
does
not
object
to
indulge
occasionally
in
vegetable
diet
being
partial
to
the
the
and
various
shrubs
he
has
a
sweet
tooth
too
and
revels
in
honey
when
he
can
get
it
the
instant
the
grizzly
bear
beheld
dick
varley
standing
in
his
path
he
rose
on
his
hind
legs
and
made
a
loud
hissing
noise
like
a
man
breathing
quick
but
much
harsher
to
this
crusoe
replied
by
a
deep
growl
and
showing
the
utmost
extent
of
his
teeth
gums
and
all
and
dick
cocked
both
barrels
of
his
rifle
to
say
that
dick
varley
felt
no
fear
would
be
simply
to
make
him
out
that
sort
of
hero
which
does
not
exist
in
nature
namely
a
hero
he
feel
a
sensation
as
if
his
bowels
had
suddenly
melted
into
water
let
not
our
reader
think
the
worse
of
dick
for
this
there
is
not
a
man
living
who
having
met
with
a
huge
grizzly
bear
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
a
wild
solitary
place
all
alone
has
not
experienced
some
such
sensation
there
was
no
cowardice
in
this
feeling
fear
is
not
cowardice
acting
in
a
wrong
and
contemptible
manner
because
of
our
fear
is
cowardice
it
is
said
that
wellington
or
napoleon
we
forget
which
once
stood
watching
the
muster
of
the
men
who
were
to
form
the
in
storming
a
citadel
there
were
many
brave
strong
stalwart
men
there
in
the
prime
of
life
and
flushed
with
the
blood
of
high
health
and
courage
there
were
also
there
a
few
men
of
riper
years
who
stood
perfectly
silent
with
lips
compressed
and
as
pale
as
death
yonder
veterans
said
the
general
pointing
to
these
soldiers
are
men
whose
courage
i
can
depend
on
they
what
they
are
going
to
the
others
yes
these
young
soldiers
were
brave
the
others
were
dick
varley
stood
for
a
few
seconds
as
if
thunderstruck
while
the
bear
stood
hissing
at
him
then
the
liquefaction
of
his
interior
ceased
and
he
felt
a
glow
of
fire
gush
through
his
veins
now
dick
knew
well
enough
that
to
fly
from
a
grizzly
bear
was
the
sure
and
certain
way
of
being
torn
to
pieces
as
when
taken
thus
by
surprise
they
almost
invariably
follow
a
retreating
enemy
he
also
knew
that
if
he
stood
where
he
was
perfectly
still
the
bear
would
get
uncomfortable
under
his
stare
and
would
retreat
from
him
but
he
neither
intended
to
run
away
himself
nor
to
allow
the
bear
to
do
so
he
intended
to
kill
it
so
he
raised
his
rifle
quickly
drew
a
bead
as
the
hunters
express
it
on
the
bear
heart
and
fired
it
immediately
dropped
on
its
fore
legs
and
rushed
at
him
back
crusoe
out
of
the
way
pup
shouted
dick
as
his
favourite
was
about
to
spring
forward
the
dog
retired
and
dick
leaped
behind
a
tree
as
the
bear
passed
he
gave
it
the
contents
of
the
second
barrel
behind
the
shoulder
which
brought
it
down
but
in
another
moment
it
rose
and
again
rushed
at
him
dick
had
no
time
to
load
neither
had
he
time
to
spring
up
the
thick
tree
beside
which
he
stood
and
the
rocky
nature
of
the
ground
out
of
which
it
grew
rendered
it
impossible
to
dodge
round
it
his
only
resource
was
flight
but
where
was
he
to
fly
to
if
he
ran
along
the
open
track
the
bear
would
overtake
him
in
a
few
seconds
on
the
right
was
a
sheer
precipice
one
hundred
feet
high
on
the
left
was
an
impenetrable
thicket
in
despair
he
thought
for
an
instant
of
clubbing
his
rifle
and
meeting
the
monster
in
close
conflict
but
the
utter
hopelessness
of
such
an
effort
was
too
apparent
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
he
glanced
up
at
the
overhanging
cliffs
there
were
one
or
two
rents
and
projections
close
above
him
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
sprang
up
and
grasped
a
ledge
of
about
an
inch
broad
ten
or
twelve
feet
up
to
which
he
clung
while
he
glanced
upward
another
projection
was
within
reach
he
gained
it
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
stood
upon
a
ledge
about
twenty
feet
up
the
cliff
where
he
had
just
room
to
plant
his
feet
firmly
without
waiting
to
look
behind
he
seized
his
and
loaded
one
barrel
of
his
rifle
and
well
was
it
for
him
that
his
early
training
had
fitted
him
to
do
this
with
rapidity
for
the
bear
dashed
up
the
precipice
after
him
at
once
the
first
time
it
missed
its
hold
and
fell
back
with
a
savage
growl
but
on
the
second
attempt
it
sunk
its
long
claws
into
the
fissures
between
the
rocks
and
ascended
steadily
till
within
a
foot
of
the
place
where
dick
stood
at
this
moment
crusoe
obedience
gave
way
before
a
sense
of
danger
uttering
one
of
his
roars
he
rushed
up
the
precipice
with
such
violence
that
although
naturally
unable
to
climb
he
reached
and
seized
the
bear
flank
despite
his
master
stern
order
to
keep
back
and
in
a
moment
the
two
rolled
down
the
face
of
the
rock
together
just
as
dick
completed
loading
knowing
that
one
stroke
of
the
bear
paw
would
be
certain
death
to
his
poor
dog
dick
leaped
from
his
perch
and
with
one
bound
reached
the
ground
at
the
same
moment
with
the
struggling
animals
and
close
beside
them
and
before
they
had
ceased
rolling
he
placed
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
into
the
bear
ear
and
blew
out
its
brains
crusoe
strange
to
say
escaped
with
only
one
scratch
on
the
side
it
was
a
deep
one
but
not
dangerous
and
gave
him
but
little
pain
at
the
time
although
it
caused
him
many
a
smart
for
some
weeks
after
thus
happily
ended
dick
first
encounter
with
a
grizzly
bear
and
although
in
the
course
of
his
wild
life
he
shot
many
specimens
of
caleb
he
used
to
say
that
he
an
pup
were
never
so
near
under
as
on
the
day
he
dropped
bar
having
refreshed
himself
with
a
long
draught
from
a
neighbouring
rivulet
and
washed
crusoe
wound
dick
skinned
the
bear
on
the
spot
we
chawed
him
up
that
time
did
we
pup
said
dick
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
as
he
surveyed
his
prize
crusoe
looked
up
and
assented
to
this
gave
us
a
hard
tussle
though
very
nigh
sent
us
both
under
he
pup
crusoe
agreed
entirely
and
as
if
the
remark
reminded
him
of
honourable
scars
he
licked
his
wound
ah
pup
cried
dick
sympathetically
hurt
ye
eh
poor
dog
hurt
him
such
a
question
no
he
should
think
not
better
ask
if
that
leap
from
the
precipice
hurt
yourself
so
crusoe
might
have
said
but
he
did
he
took
no
notice
of
the
remark
whatever
we
cut
him
up
now
pup
continued
dick
the
skin
make
a
splendid
bed
for
you
an
me
o
nights
and
a
saddle
for
charlie
dick
cut
out
all
the
claws
of
the
bear
by
the
roots
and
spent
the
remainder
of
that
night
in
cleaning
them
and
stringing
them
on
a
strip
of
leather
to
form
a
necklace
independently
of
the
value
of
these
enormous
claws
the
largest
as
long
as
a
man
middle
finger
as
an
evidence
of
prowess
they
formed
a
remarkably
graceful
collar
which
dick
wore
round
his
neck
ever
after
with
as
much
pride
as
if
he
had
been
a
pawnee
warrior
when
it
was
finished
he
held
it
out
at
and
said
crusoe
my
pup
ai
ye
proud
of
it
i
tell
ye
what
it
is
pup
the
next
time
you
an
i
floor
caleb
i
put
the
claws
round
neck
an
make
ye
wear
em
ever
arter
so
i
will
the
dog
did
not
seem
quite
to
appreciate
this
piece
of
prospective
good
fortune
vanity
had
no
place
in
his
honest
breast
and
sooth
to
say
it
had
not
a
large
place
in
that
of
his
master
either
as
we
may
well
grant
when
we
consider
that
this
first
display
of
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
his
hunter
soul
having
at
last
realized
its
brightest
dick
dangers
and
triumphs
seemed
to
accumulate
on
him
rather
thickly
at
this
place
for
on
the
very
next
day
he
had
a
narrow
escape
of
being
killed
by
a
deer
the
way
of
it
was
this
having
run
short
of
meat
and
not
being
particularly
fond
of
grizzly
bear
steak
he
shouldered
his
rifle
and
sallied
forth
in
quest
of
game
accompanied
by
crusoe
whose
frequent
glances
towards
his
wounded
side
showed
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
the
day
before
it
hurt
him
now
they
had
not
gone
far
when
they
came
on
the
track
of
a
deer
in
the
snow
and
followed
it
up
till
they
spied
a
magnificent
buck
about
three
hundred
yards
off
standing
in
a
level
patch
of
ground
which
was
everywhere
surrounded
either
by
rocks
or
thicket
it
was
a
long
shot
but
as
the
nature
of
the
ground
rendered
it
impossible
for
dick
to
get
nearer
without
being
seen
he
fired
and
wounded
the
buck
so
badly
that
he
came
up
with
it
in
a
few
minutes
the
snow
had
drifted
in
the
place
where
it
stood
bolt
upright
ready
for
a
spring
so
dick
went
round
a
little
way
crusoe
following
till
he
was
in
a
proper
position
to
fire
again
just
as
he
pulled
the
trigger
crusoe
gave
a
howl
behind
him
and
disturbed
his
aim
so
that
he
feared
he
had
missed
but
the
deer
fell
and
he
hurried
towards
it
on
coming
up
however
the
buck
sprang
to
its
legs
rushed
at
him
with
its
hair
bristling
knocked
him
down
in
the
snow
and
deliberately
commenced
stamping
him
to
death
dick
was
stunned
for
a
moment
and
lay
quite
still
so
the
deer
left
off
pommelling
him
and
stood
looking
at
him
but
the
instant
he
moved
it
plunged
at
him
again
and
gave
him
another
pounding
until
he
was
content
to
lie
still
this
was
done
several
times
and
dick
felt
his
strength
going
fast
he
was
surprised
that
crusoe
did
not
come
to
his
rescue
and
once
he
cleared
his
mouth
and
whistled
to
him
but
as
the
deer
gave
him
another
pounding
for
this
he
did
attempt
it
again
he
now
for
the
first
time
bethought
him
of
his
knife
and
quietly
drew
it
from
his
belt
but
the
deer
observed
the
motion
and
was
on
him
again
in
a
moment
dick
however
sprang
up
on
his
left
elbow
and
making
several
desperate
thrusts
upward
succeeded
in
stabbing
the
animal
to
the
heart
rising
and
shaking
the
snow
from
his
garments
he
whistled
loudly
to
crusoe
and
on
listening
heard
him
whining
piteously
he
hurried
to
the
place
whence
the
sound
came
and
found
that
the
poor
dog
had
fallen
into
a
deep
pit
or
crevice
in
the
rocks
which
had
been
concealed
from
view
by
a
crust
of
snow
and
he
was
now
making
frantic
but
unavailing
efforts
to
leap
out
dick
soon
freed
him
from
his
prison
by
means
of
his
belt
which
he
let
down
for
the
dog
to
grasp
and
then
returned
to
camp
with
as
much
as
he
could
carry
dear
meat
it
certainly
was
to
him
for
it
had
nearly
cost
him
his
life
and
left
him
all
black
and
blue
for
weeks
after
happily
no
bones
were
broken
so
the
incident
only
confined
him
a
day
to
his
encampment
soon
after
this
the
snow
fell
thicker
than
ever
and
it
became
evident
that
an
unusually
early
winter
was
about
to
set
in
among
the
mountains
this
was
a
terrible
calamity
for
if
the
regular
snow
of
winter
set
in
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
either
to
advance
or
retreat
while
he
was
sitting
on
his
bearskin
by
the
one
day
thinking
anxiously
what
he
should
do
and
feeling
that
he
must
either
make
the
attempt
to
escape
or
perish
miserably
in
that
secluded
spot
a
strange
unwonted
sound
struck
upon
his
ear
and
caused
both
him
and
crusoe
to
spring
violently
to
their
feet
and
listen
could
he
be
dreaming
it
seemed
like
the
sound
of
human
voices
for
a
moment
he
stood
with
his
eyes
rivetted
on
the
ground
his
lips
apart
and
his
nostrils
distended
as
he
listened
with
the
utmost
intensity
then
he
darted
out
and
bounded
round
the
edge
of
a
rock
which
concealed
an
extensive
but
narrow
valley
from
his
view
and
there
to
his
amazement
he
beheld
a
band
of
about
a
hundred
human
beings
advancing
on
horseback
slowly
through
the
snow
chapter
xviii
surprise
and
a
piece
of
good
news
the
crusoe
proved
and
the
peigans
dick
first
and
most
natural
impulse
on
beholding
this
band
was
to
mount
his
horse
and
fly
for
his
mind
naturally
enough
recurred
to
the
former
rough
treatment
he
had
experienced
at
the
hands
of
indians
on
second
thoughts
however
he
considered
it
wiser
to
throw
himself
upon
the
hospitality
of
the
strangers
for
thought
he
they
can
but
kill
me
an
if
i
remain
here
i
like
to
die
at
any
rate
so
dick
mounted
his
wild
horse
grasped
his
rifle
in
his
right
hand
and
followed
by
crusoe
galloped
full
tilt
down
the
valley
to
meet
them
he
had
heard
enough
of
the
customs
of
savage
tribes
and
had
also
of
late
experienced
enough
to
convince
him
that
when
a
man
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
an
overwhelming
force
his
best
policy
was
to
assume
an
air
of
confident
courage
he
therefore
approached
them
at
his
utmost
speed
the
effect
upon
the
advancing
band
was
electrical
and
little
wonder
for
the
young
hunter
appearance
was
very
striking
his
horse
from
having
rested
a
good
deal
of
late
was
full
of
spirit
its
neck
was
arched
its
nostrils
expanded
and
its
mane
and
tail
never
having
been
checked
in
their
growth
flew
wildly
around
him
in
voluminous
curls
dick
own
hair
not
having
been
clipped
for
many
months
appeared
scarcely
less
wild
as
they
thundered
down
the
rocky
pass
at
what
appeared
a
gallop
add
to
this
the
grandeur
of
the
scene
out
of
which
they
sprang
and
the
gigantic
dog
that
bounded
by
his
side
and
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
indian
warriors
clustered
together
and
prepared
to
receive
this
bold
horseman
as
if
he
in
his
own
proper
person
were
a
complete
squadron
of
cavalry
it
is
probable
also
that
they
fully
expected
the
tribe
of
which
dick
was
the
chief
to
be
at
his
heels
as
he
drew
near
the
excitement
among
the
strangers
seemed
very
great
and
from
the
peculiarity
of
the
various
cries
that
reached
him
he
knew
that
there
were
women
and
children
in
the
band
a
fact
which
in
such
a
place
and
at
such
a
season
was
so
unnatural
that
it
surprised
him
very
much
he
noted
also
that
though
the
men
in
front
were
indians
their
dresses
were
those
of
trappers
and
hunters
and
he
almost
leaped
out
of
his
saddle
when
he
observed
that
were
among
them
but
he
had
barely
time
to
note
these
facts
when
he
was
up
with
the
band
according
to
indian
custom
he
did
not
check
his
speed
till
he
was
within
four
or
five
yards
of
the
who
stood
in
a
line
before
him
quite
still
and
with
their
rifles
lying
loosely
in
their
left
palms
then
he
reined
his
steed
almost
on
its
haunches
one
of
the
indians
advanced
and
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
language
which
was
quite
unintelligible
to
dick
who
replied
in
the
little
pawnee
he
could
muster
that
he
did
understand
him
why
you
must
be
a
trapper
exclaimed
a
man
riding
out
from
the
group
can
you
speak
english
ay
that
can
i
cried
dick
joyfully
riding
up
and
shaking
the
stranger
heartily
by
the
hand
an
right
glad
am
i
to
fall
in
wi
a
an
a
civil
tongue
in
his
head
good
sooth
sir
replied
the
stranger
with
a
quiet
smile
on
his
kind
face
i
can
return
you
the
compliment
for
when
i
saw
you
come
thundering
down
the
corrie
with
that
wonderful
horse
and
no
less
wonderful
dog
of
yours
i
thought
you
were
the
wild
man
the
mountain
himself
and
had
an
ambush
ready
to
back
you
but
young
man
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
live
here
in
the
mountain
all
alone
after
this
fashion
no
that
i
do
i
comed
here
in
my
travels
but
truly
this
bea
my
home
but
sir
for
i
see
you
are
what

a
bourgeois
how
comes
it
that
such
a
band
as
this
rides
i
the
mountains
d
mean
to
say
that
live
here
dick
looked
round
in
surprise
as
he
spoke
upon
the
crowd
of
mounted
men
and
women
with
children
and
that
now
surrounded
him
is
a
fair
question
lad
i
am
a
principal
among
the
whose
chief
lies
near
the
pacific
ocean
on
the
west
side
of
these
mountains
and
i
have
come
with
these
trappers
and
their
families
as
you
see
to
hunt
the
beaver
and
other
animals
for
a
season
in
the
mountains
we
never
been
here
before
but
that
a
matter
of
little
moment
for
it
not
the
first
time
i
been
on
what
may
be
called
a
expedition
we
are
somewhat
entangled
however
just
now
among
these
wild
passes
and
if
you
can
guide
us
out
of
our
difficulties
to
the
east
side
of
the
mountains
i
thank
you
heartily
and
pay
you
well
but
first
tell
me
who
and
what
you
are
if
it
a
fair
question
my
name
is
dick
varley
and
my
home
in
the
mustang
valley
near
the
missouri
river
as
to
i
am

but
i
hope
to
desarve
the
name
o
a
hunter
some
day
i
can
guide
you
to
the
east
side
o
the
mountains
for
i
comed
from
there
but
more
than
that
i
ca
do
for
i
a
stranger
to
the
country
here
like
yourself
but
you
on
the
east
side
o
the
mountains
already
if
i
mistake
not
only
these
mountains
are
so
rugged
and
jumbled
up
that
it
not
easy
tellin
where
ye
are
and
what
continued
dick
may
be
the
name
the
bourgeois
who
speaks
to
me
my
name
is
cameron
walter
cameron
a
name
among
the
scottish
hills
although
it
sounds
a
little
strange
here
and
now
young
man
will
you
join
my
party
as
guide
and
afterwards
remain
as
trapper
it
will
pay
you
better
i
think
than
roving
about
alone
dick
shook
his
head
and
looked
grave
i
guide
you
said
he
as
far
as
my
knowledge
help
me
but
after
that
i
must
return
to
look
for
two
comrades
whom
i
have
lost
they
have
been
driven
into
the
mountains
by
a
band
of
injuns
god
grant
they
may
not
have
bin
scalped
the
trader
face
looked
troubled
and
he
spoke
with
one
of
his
indians
for
a
few
minutes
in
earnest
hurried
tones
what
were
they
like
young
man
dick
described
them
the
same
continued
the
trader
they
been
seen
lad
not
more
than
two
days
ago
by
this
indian
here
when
he
was
out
hunting
alone
some
miles
away
from
our
camp
he
came
suddenly
on
a
band
of
indians
who
had
two
prisoners
with
them
such
as
you
describe
they
were
stout
said
you
yes
both
of
them
cried
dick
listening
with
intense
eagerness
ay
they
were
tied
to
their
horses
an
from
what
i
know
of
these
fellows
i
sure
they
doomed
but
i
help
you
my
friend
as
well
as
i
can
they
ca
be
far
from
this
i
treated
my
indian
story
about
them
as
a
mere
fabrication
for
he
the
most
notorious
liar
in
my
company
but
he
seems
to
have
spoken
truth
for
once
thanks
thanks
good
sir
cried
dick
had
we
not
best
turn
back
and
follow
them
at
once
nay
friend
not
quite
so
fast
replied
cameron
pointing
to
his
people
these
must
be
provided
for
first
but
i
shall
be
ready
before
the
sun
goes
down
and
now
as
i
presume
you
do
bivouac
in
the
snow
will
you
kindly
conduct
us
to
your
encampment
if
it
be
not
far
hence
although
burning
with
impatience
to
fly
to
the
rescue
of
his
friends
dick
felt
constrained
to
comply
with
so
reasonable
a
request
so
he
led
the
way
to
his
where
the
band
of
immediately
began
to
pitch
their
tents
cut
down
wood
kindle
fires
fill
their
kettles
with
water
cook
their
food
and
in
fact
make
themselves
comfortable
the
wild
spot
which
an
hour
before
had
been
so
still
and
grand
and
gloomy
was
now
as
if
by
magic
transformed
into
a
bustling
village
with
bright
fires
blazing
among
the
rocks
and
bushes
and
merry
voices
of
men
women
and
children
ringing
in
the
air
it
seemed
almost
incredible
and
no
wonder
dick
in
his
bewilderment
had
difficulty
in
believing
it
was
not
all
a
dream
in
days
long
gone
by
the
in
that
country
was
carried
on
in
a
very
different
way
from
the
manner
in
which
it
is
now
conducted
these
wild
regions
indeed
are
still
as
lonesome
and
untenanted
save
by
wild
beasts
and
wandering
tribes
of
indians
as
they
were
then
but
the
indians
of
the
present
day
have
become
accustomed
to
the
trader
whose
little
wooden
forts
or
are
dotted
here
and
there
at
wide
intervals
all
over
the
land
but
in
the
days
of
which
we
write
it
was
not
so
the
at
that
time
went
forth
in
armed
bands
into
the
heart
of
the
indians
country
and
he
who
went
forth
did
so
with
his
life
in
his
hand
as
in
the
case
of
the
soldier
who
went
out
to
battle
there
was
great
probability
that
he
might
never
return
the
band
of
which
walter
cameron
was
the
chief
had
many
months
before
started
from
one
of
the
distant
posts
of
oregon
on
a
hunting
expedition
into
the
then
totally
unknown
lands
of
the
snake
indians
it
consisted
of
about
sixty
men
thirty
women
and
as
many
children
of
various
ages
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
souls
in
all
many
of
the
boys
were
capable
of
using
the
gun
and
setting
a
the
men
were
a
most
motley
set
there
were
canadians
iroquois
and
scotchmen
most
of
the
women
had
indian
blood
in
their
veins
and
a
few
were
pure
indians
the
equipment
of
this
strange
band
consisted
of
upwards
of
two
hundred
which
are
similar
to
our
with
this
difference
that
they
have
two
springs
and
no
teeth
seventy
guns
a
few
articles
for
trade
with
the
indians
and
a
large
supply
of
powder
and
ball
the
whole
men
women
children
goods
and
chattels
being
carried
on
the
backs
of
nearly
four
hundred
horses
many
of
these
horses
at
starting
were
not
laden
being
designed
for
the
transport
of
furs
that
were
to
be
taken
in
the
course
of
the
season
for
food
this
adventurous
party
depended
entirely
on
their
guns
and
during
the
march
hunters
were
kept
constantly
out
ahead
as
a
matter
of
course
their
living
was
precarious
sometimes
their
kettles
were
overflowing
at
others
they
scarce
refrained
from
eating
their
horses
but
during
the
months
they
had
already
spent
in
the
wilderness
good
living
had
been
the
rule
starvation
the
exception
they
had
already
collected
a
large
quantity
of
beaver
skins
which
at
that
time
were
among
the
most
valuable
in
the
market
although
they
are
now
scarcely
saleable
having
shot
two
wild
horses
seven
elks
six
small
deer
and
four
sheep
the
day
before
they
met
dick
varley
the
camp
kettles
were
full
and
the
people
consequently
happy
now
master
dick
varley
said
cameron
touching
the
young
hunter
on
the
shoulder
as
he
stood
ready
equipped
by
one
of
the
i
at
your
service
the
people
wo
need
any
more
looking
after
i
divide
my
men
thirty
shall
go
after
this
rascally
band
of
peigans
for
such
i
believe
they
are
and
thirty
shall
remain
to
guard
the
camp
are
you
ready
ready
ay
this
hour
past
mount
then
lad
the
men
have
already
been
told
off
and
are
mustering
down
yonder
where
the
deer
gave
you
such
a
licking
dick
needed
no
second
bidding
he
vaulted
on
charlie
back
and
along
with
their
commander
joined
the
men
who
were
thirty
as
fine
hardy
reckless
looking
fellows
as
one
could
desire
for
a
they
were
chatting
and
laughing
while
they
examined
their
guns
and
their
horses
were
sorry
looking
animals
compared
with
the
magnificent
creature
that
dick
bestrode
but
they
were
hardy
nevertheless
and
well
fitted
for
their
peculiar
work
my
wot
a
blazer
exclaimed
a
trapper
as
dick
rode
up
where
you
git
him
inquired
a
i
caught
him
answered
dick
baw
cried
the
first
speaker
dick
took
no
notice
of
this
last
remark
no
did
ye
though
he
asked
again
i
did
answered
dick
quietly
i
creased
him
in
the
prairie
you
can
see
the
mark
on
his
neck
if
you
look
the
men
began
to
feel
that
the
young
hunter
was
perhaps
a
little
beyond
them
at
their
own
trade
and
regarded
him
with
increased
respect
look
sharp
now
lads
said
cameron
impatiently
to
several
dilatory
members
of
the
band
night
will
be
on
us
ere
long
who
sold
ye
the
collar
inquired
another
man
of
dick
i
did
buy
it
i
killed
the
bear
and
made
it
did
ye
though
all
be
yer
lone
ay
that
was
much
was
it
you
begun
well
yonker
said
a
tall
hunter
whose
general
appearance
was
not
unlike
that
of
joe
blunt
jest
keep
clear
o
the
injuns
an
the
grog
bottle
an
ye
a
life
before
ye
at
this
point
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
order
being
given
to
move
on
which
was
obeyed
in
silence
and
the
cavalcade
descending
the
valley
entered
one
of
the
gorges
in
the
mountains
for
the
first
cameron
rode
a
little
ahead
of
his
men
then
he
turned
to
speak
to
one
of
them
and
for
the
first
time
observed
crusoe
trotting
close
beside
his
master
horse
ah
master
dick
he
exclaimed
with
a
troubled
expression
that
wo
do
it
would
never
do
to
take
a
dog
on
an
expedition
like
this
why
not
asked
dick
the
pup
quiet
and
peaceable
i
doubt
it
not
but
he
will
betray
our
presence
to
the
indians
which
might
be
inconvenient
i
have
travelled
more
than
a
thousand
miles
through
prairie
and
forest
among
game
an
among
injuns
an
the
pup
never
betrayed
me
yet
said
dick
with
suppressed
vehemence
he
has
saved
my
life
more
than
once
though
you
seem
to
have
perfect
confidence
in
your
dog
but
as
this
is
a
serious
matter
you
must
not
expect
me
to
share
in
it
without
proof
of
his
trustworthiness
the
pup
may
be
useful
to
us
how
would
you
have
it
proved
inquired
dick
any
way
you
like
you
forgot
your
belt
at
starting
i
think
i
heerd
ye
say
yes
i
did
replied
the
trader
smiling
dick
immediately
took
hold
of
cameron
coat
and
bade
crusoe
smell
it
which
the
dog
did
very
carefully
then
he
showed
him
his
own
belt
and
said
go
back
to
the
camp
and
fetch
it
pup
crusoe
was
off
in
a
moment
and
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
returned
with
cameron
belt
in
his
mouth
well
i
trust
him
said
cameron
patting
crusoe
head
forward
lads
and
away
they
went
at
a
brisk
trot
along
the
bottom
of
a
beautiful
valley
on
each
side
of
which
the
mountains
towered
in
dark
masses
soon
the
moon
rose
and
afforded
light
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
travel
all
night
in
the
track
of
the
indian
hunter
who
said
he
had
seen
the
peigans
and
who
was
constituted
guide
to
the
party
hour
after
hour
the
horsemen
pressed
on
without
check
now
galloping
over
a
level
plain
now
bounding
by
the
banks
of
a
rivulet
or
bending
their
heads
to
escape
the
boughs
of
overhanging
trees
and
anon
toiling
slowly
up
among
the
rocks
of
some
narrow
defile
at
last
the
moon
set
and
the
order
was
given
to
halt
in
a
little
plain
where
there
were
wood
and
water
the
horses
were
picketed
a
fire
kindled
a
mouthful
of
dried
meat
hastily
eaten
the
watch
was
set
and
then
each
man
scraped
away
the
snow
spread
some
branches
on
the
ground
and
wrapping
himself
in
his
blanket
went
to
sleep
with
his
feet
presented
towards
the
fire
two
hours
were
allowed
for
rest
then
they
were
awakened
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
off
again
by
the
gray
light
of
dawn
in
this
way
they
travelled
two
nights
and
a
day
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
came
suddenly
on
a
small
party
of
nine
indians
who
were
seated
on
the
ground
with
their
and
blankets
by
their
sides
they
had
evidently
been
taken
by
surprise
but
they
made
no
attempt
to
escape
knowing
that
it
was
useless
each
sat
still
with
his
bow
and
arrows
between
his
legs
on
the
ground
ready
for
instant
use
as
soon
as
cameron
spoke
however
in
their
own
language
they
felt
relieved
and
began
to
talk
where
do
you
come
from
and
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
the
trader
we
have
come
to
trade
with
the
white
men
one
of
them
replied
and
to
hunt
we
have
come
from
the
missouri
our
country
is
far
away
do
peigans
hunt
with
asked
cameron
pointing
to
their
weapons
this
question
seemed
to
perplex
them
for
they
saw
that
their
interrogator
knew
the
difference
between
a
war
and
a
hunting
arrow
the
former
being
barbed
in
order
to
render
its
extraction
from
the
wound
difficult
while
the
head
of
the
latter
is
round
and
can
be
drawn
out
of
game
that
has
been
killed
and
used
again
and
do
peigans
continued
cameron
come
from
a
far
country
to
trade
with
the
white
men
nothing
again
the
indians
were
silent
for
they
had
not
an
article
to
trade
about
them
cameron
now
felt
convinced
that
this
party
of
peigans
into
whose
hands
joe
blunt
and
henri
had
fallen
were
nothing
else
than
a
war
party
and
that
the
men
now
before
him
were
a
scouting
party
sent
out
from
them
probably
to
spy
out
his
own
camp
on
the
trail
of
which
they
had
fallen
so
he
said
to
them
the
peigans
are
not
wise
men
they
tell
lies
to
the
traders
i
will
tell
you
that
you
are
a
war
party
and
that
you
are
only
a
few
warriors
sent
out
to
spy
the
traders
camp
you
have
also
two
prisoners
in
your
camp
you
can
not
deceive
me
it
is
useless
to
try
now
conduct
me
to
your
camp
my
object
is
not
war
it
is
peace
i
will
speak
with
your
chiefs
about
trading
with
the
white
men
and
we
will
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
are
my
words
good
despite
their
proverbial
control
of
muscle
these
indians
could
not
conceal
their
astonishment
at
hearing
so
much
of
their
affairs
thus
laid
bare
so
they
said
that
the
chief
was
wise
that
he
must
be
a
great
medicine
man
and
that
what
he
said
was
all
true
except
about
the
white
men
they
had
never
seen
any
and
knew
nothing
whatever
about
those
he
spoke
of
this
was
a
terrible
piece
of
news
to
poor
dick
and
at
first
his
heart
fairly
sank
within
him
but
by
degrees
he
came
to
be
more
hopeful
he
concluded
that
if
these
men
told
lies
in
regard
to
one
thing
they
would
do
it
in
regard
to
another
and
perhaps
they
might
have
some
strong
reason
for
denying
any
knowledge
of
joe
and
henri
the
indians
now
packed
up
the
buffalo
robes
on
which
they
had
slept
and
the
mouthful
of
provisions
they
had
taken
with
them
i
do
believe
a
word
of
what
they
say
about
your
friends
said
cameron
to
dick
in
a
low
tone
while
the
indians
were
thus
engaged
depend
upon
it
they
hope
to
hide
them
till
they
can
send
to
the
settlements
and
get
a
ransom
or
till
they
get
an
opportunity
of
torturing
them
to
death
before
their
women
and
children
when
they
get
back
to
their
own
village
but
we
balk
them
my
friend
do
not
fear
the
indians
were
soon
ready
to
start
for
they
were
cumbered
with
marvellously
little
camp
equipage
in
less
than
after
their
discovery
they
were
running
like
deer
ahead
of
the
cavalcade
in
the
direction
of
the
peigan
camp
chapter
xix
with
the
does
good
service
as
a
savages
a
run
of
twenty
miles
brought
the
travellers
to
a
rugged
defile
in
the
mountains
from
which
they
had
a
view
of
a
beautiful
valley
of
considerable
extent
during
the
last
two
days
a
steady
thaw
had
been
rapidly
melting
away
the
snow
so
that
it
appeared
only
here
and
there
in
the
landscape
in
dazzling
patches
at
the
distance
of
about
from
where
they
halted
to
breathe
the
horses
before
commencing
the
descent
into
this
vale
several
thin
wreaths
of
smoke
were
seen
rising
above
the
trees
is
that
your
camp
inquired
cameron
riding
up
to
the
indian
runners
who
stood
in
a
group
in
front
looking
as
fresh
after
their
twenty
miles
run
as
though
they
had
only
had
a
short
walk
to
this
they
answered
in
the
affirmative
adding
that
there
were
about
two
hundred
peigans
there
it
might
have
been
thought
that
thirty
men
would
have
hesitated
to
venture
to
attack
so
large
a
number
as
two
hundred
but
it
had
always
been
found
in
the
experience
of
indian
life
that
a
few
resolute
white
men
well
armed
were
more
than
a
match
for
ten
times
their
number
of
indians
and
this
arose
not
so
much
from
the
superior
strength
or
agility
of
the
whites
over
their
red
foes
as
from
that
courage
and
utter
recklessness
of
their
lives
in
combat
qualities
which
the
crafty
savage
can
neither
imitate
nor
understand
the
information
was
received
with
perfect
indifference
by
most
of
the
trappers
and
with
contemptuous
laughter
by
some
for
a
large
number
of
cameron
men
were
wild
fellows
who
would
have
as
gladly
taken
the
life
of
an
indian
as
that
of
a
buffalo
just
as
the
word
was
given
to
resume
the
march
dick
varley
rode
up
to
cameron
and
said
in
a
somewhat
anxious
tone
d
obsarve
sir
that
one
o
the
redskins
has
gone
off
ahead
o
his
comrades
i
see
that
master
dick
and
it
was
a
mistake
of
mine
not
to
have
stopped
him
but
he
was
gone
too
far
before
i
observed
it
and
i
thought
it
better
to
appear
unconcerned
we
must
push
on
though
and
give
him
as
short
time
as
possible
to
talk
with
his
comrades
in
the
camp
the
trappers
pressed
forward
accordingly
at
a
gallop
and
were
soon
in
front
of
the
clump
of
trees
amongst
which
the
peigans
were
encamped
their
approach
had
evidently
spread
great
alarm
among
them
for
there
was
a
good
deal
of
bustle
and
running
to
and
fro
but
by
the
time
the
trappers
had
dismounted
and
advanced
in
a
body
on
foot
the
savages
had
resumed
their
usual
quiet
dignity
of
appearance
and
were
seated
calmly
round
their
fires
with
their
bows
and
arrows
beside
them
there
were
no
tents
no
women
or
children
and
the
general
aspect
of
the
men
showed
cameron
conclusively
that
his
surmise
about
their
being
a
war
party
was
correct
a
council
was
immediately
called
the
trappers
ranged
themselves
on
one
side
of
the
council
fire
and
the
indians
on
the
other
meanwhile
our
friend
crusoe
had
been
displaying
considerable
irritability
against
the
indians
and
he
would
certainly
have
attacked
the
whole
two
hundred
if
he
had
not
been
ordered
by
his
master
to
lie
still
but
never
in
his
life
before
had
crusoe
obeyed
with
such
a
bad
grace
he
bristled
and
whined
in
a
low
tremulous
tone
and
looked
imploringly
at
dick
as
if
for
permission
to
fly
at
them
the
traders
are
glad
to
meet
with
the
peigans
began
cameron
who
determined
to
make
no
allusion
to
his
knowledge
that
they
were
a
war
party
for
they
wish
to
be
friends
with
all
the
children
of
the
woods
and
prairies
they
wish
to
trade
with
them
to
exchange
blankets
and
guns
and
beads
and
other
goods
which
the
peigans
require
for
furs
of
animals
which
the
require
ho
ho
exclaimed
the
indians
which
expression
might
be
translated
hear
hear
but
continued
cameron
we
wish
to
have
no
war
we
wish
to
see
the
hatchet
buried
and
to
see
all
the
red
men
and
the
white
men
smoking
the
pipe
of
peace
and
hunting
like
brothers
the
ho
ho
ing
at
this
was
very
emphatic
now
resumed
the
trader
the
peigans
have
got
two
prisoners
two
in
their
camp
and
as
we
can
not
be
on
good
terms
while
our
brothers
are
detained
we
have
come
to
ask
for
them
and
to
some
to
the
peigans
to
this
there
was
no
ho
at
all
but
a
prolonged
silence
which
was
at
length
interrupted
by
a
tall
chief
stepping
forward
to
address
the
trappers
what
the
chief
has
said
is
good
began
the
indian
his
words
are
wise
and
his
heart
is
not
double
the
are
willing
to
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
and
to
hunt
with
all
men
as
brothers
but
they
can
not
do
it
while
many
of
their
scalps
are
hanging
in
the
lodges
of
their
enemies
and
fringing
the
robes
of
the
warriors
the
peigans
must
have
vengeance
then
they
will
make
peace
after
a
short
pause
he
continued
the
chief
is
wrong
when
he
says
there
are
in
the
peigan
camp
the
peigans
are
not
at
war
with
the
neither
have
they
seen
any
on
their
march
the
camp
is
open
let
the
look
round
and
see
that
what
we
say
is
true
the
chief
waved
his
hand
towards
his
warriors
as
he
concluded
as
if
to
say
search
amongst
them
there
are
no
there
cameron
now
spoke
to
dick
in
a
low
tone
they
speak
confidently
he
said
and
i
fear
greatly
that
your
poor
comrades
have
either
been
killed
or
conveyed
away
from
the
camp
and
hidden
among
the
mountains
in
which
case
even
though
they
should
not
be
far
off
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
to
find
them
especially
when
such
a
band
of
rascals
is
near
compelling
us
to
keep
together
but
i
try
what
a
little
tempting
them
with
goods
will
do
at
any
rate
we
sha
give
in
without
a
scuffle
it
now
for
the
first
time
flashed
across
dick
varley
that
there
was
something
more
than
he
imagined
in
crusoe
restless
anxiety
which
had
not
in
the
least
abated
and
the
idea
of
making
use
of
him
now
occurred
to
his
mind
i
a
notion
that
i
settle
this
matter
in
a
shorter
time
than
you
think
he
said
hurriedly
if
you
agree
to
try
what
will
do
the
trader
looked
grave
and
undecided
i
never
resort
to
that
except
as
a
last
hope
he
answered
but
i
a
good
deal
of
confidence
in
your
prudence
what
would
you
advise
dick
and
the
trader
whispered
a
few
minutes
together
while
some
of
the
men
in
order
to
show
the
indians
how
perfectly
unconcerned
they
were
and
how
ready
for
took
out
their
pipes
and
began
to
smoke
both
parties
were
seated
on
the
ground
and
during
this
interval
the
indians
also
held
eager
discussion
at
length
cameron
stood
up
and
said
to
his
men
in
a
quiet
tone
be
ready
lads
for
instant
action
when
i
give
the
word
spring
to
your
feet
and
cock
your
guns
but
fire
a
shot
till
you
get
the
he
then
stepped
forward
and
said
the
peigan
warriors
are
they
know
that
they
have
hid
the
prisoners
we
do
not
wish
to
quarrel
but
if
they
are
not
delivered
up
at
once
the
and
the
peigans
will
not
be
friends
upon
this
the
indian
chief
again
stood
forward
and
said
the
peigans
are
they
have
not
seen
till
they
can
say
no
more
without
moving
hand
or
foot
cameron
then
said
in
a
firm
tone
the
first
peigan
that
moves
shall
die
up
lads
and
ready
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
trappers
sprang
to
their
feet
and
cocking
their
rifles
stood
perfectly
motionless
scowling
at
the
savages
who
were
completely
taken
by
surprise
at
the
unusual
suddenness
and
informality
of
such
a
declaration
of
war
not
a
man
moved
for
unlike
white
men
they
seldom
risk
their
lives
in
open
fight
and
as
they
looked
at
the
formidable
row
of
muzzles
that
waited
but
a
word
to
send
instant
death
into
their
midst
they
felt
that
discretion
was
at
that
time
the
better
part
of
valour
now
said
cameron
while
dick
varley
and
crusoe
stepped
up
beside
him
my
young
warrior
will
search
for
the
prisoners
if
they
are
found
we
will
take
them
and
go
away
if
they
are
not
found
we
will
ask
the
peigans
to
forgive
us
and
will
give
them
gifts
but
in
the
meantime
if
a
peigan
moves
from
the
spot
where
he
sits
or
lifts
a
bow
my
young
men
shall
fire
and
the
peigans
know
that
the
rifle
of
the
always
kills
without
waiting
for
an
answer
dick
immediately
said
seek
out
pup
and
crusoe
bounded
away
for
a
few
minutes
he
sprang
hither
and
thither
through
the
camp
quite
regardless
of
the
indians
and
snuffed
the
air
several
times
whining
in
an
excited
tone
as
if
to
relieve
his
feelings
then
he
put
his
nose
to
the
ground
and
ran
straight
forward
into
the
woods
dick
immediately
bounded
after
him
like
a
deer
while
the
trappers
kept
silent
guard
over
the
savages
for
some
time
crusoe
ran
straight
forward
then
he
came
to
a
spot
where
there
was
a
good
deal
of
drifted
snow
on
the
ground
here
he
seemed
to
lose
the
trail
for
a
little
and
ran
about
in
all
directions
whining
in
a
most
piteous
tone
seek
out
pup
repeated
dick
encouragingly
while
his
own
breast
heaved
with
excitement
and
expectation
in
a
few
seconds
the
dog
resumed
its
onward
course
and
led
the
way
into
a
wild
dark
spot
which
was
so
overshadowed
by
trees
and
precipitous
cliffs
that
the
light
of
the
sun
scarce
found
entrance
there
were
many
huge
masses
of
rock
scattered
over
the
ground
which
had
fallen
from
the
cliffs
behind
one
of
these
lay
a
mound
of
dried
leaves
towards
which
crusoe
darted
and
commenced
scraping
violently
trembling
with
dread
that
he
should
find
this
to
be
the
grave
of
his
murdered
companions
dick
rushed
forward
and
hastily
cleared
away
the
leaves
the
first
handful
thrown
off
revealed
part
of
the
figure
of
a
man
dick
heart
beat
audibly
as
he
cleared
the
leaves
from
the
face
and
he
uttered
a
suppressed
cry
on
beholding
the
features
of
joe
blunt
but
they
were
not
those
of
a
dead
man
joe
eyes
met
his
with
a
scowl
of
anger
which
instantly
gave
place
to
one
of
intense
surprise
joe
blunt
exclaimed
dick
in
a
voice
of
intense
amazement
while
crusoe
snuffed
round
the
heap
of
leaves
and
whined
with
excitement
but
joe
did
not
move
neither
did
he
speak
a
word
in
reply
for
the
very
good
reason
that
his
mouth
was
tightly
bound
with
a
band
of
leather
his
hands
and
feet
were
tied
and
his
whole
body
was
secured
in
a
rigid
immovable
position
by
being
bound
to
a
pole
of
about
his
own
length
in
a
moment
dick
knife
was
out
bands
and
cords
were
severed
and
joe
blunt
was
free
thank
god
exclaimed
joe
with
a
deep
earnest
sigh
the
instant
his
lips
were
loosened
and
thanks
to
lad
he
added
endeavouring
to
rise
but
his
limbs
had
become
so
benumbed
in
consequence
of
the
cords
by
which
they
had
been
compressed
that
for
some
time
he
could
not
move
i
rub
ye
joe
i
soon
rub
ye
into
a
right
state
said
dick
going
down
on
his
knees
no
no
lad
look
sharp
and
dig
up
henri
he
just
beside
me
here
dick
immediately
rose
and
pushing
aside
the
heap
of
leaves
found
henri
securely
bound
in
the
same
fashion
but
he
could
scarce
refrain
from
laughing
at
the
expression
of
that
worthy
face
hearing
the
voices
of
joe
and
dick
varley
in
conversation
though
unable
to
see
their
persons
he
was
filled
with
such
unbounded
amazement
that
his
eyes
when
uncovered
were
found
to
be
at
their
largest
possible
stretch
and
as
for
the
eyebrows
they
were
gone
utterly
lost
among
the
roots
of
his
voluminous
hair
henri
friend
i
knew
i
should
find
ye
said
dick
cutting
the
thongs
that
bound
him
get
up
if
ye
can
we
have
much
time
to
lose
an
mayhap
we
have
to
fight
afore
we
done
wi
the
redskins
can
ye
rise
henri
could
do
nothing
but
lie
on
his
back
and
gasp
eh
possible
mon
frere
oh
non
non
possible
oui
my
broder
deek
here
he
attempted
to
rise
but
being
unable
fell
back
again
and
the
whole
thing
came
so
suddenly
and
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
his
impulsive
mind
that
he
incontinently
burst
into
tears
then
he
burst
into
a
long
laugh
suddenly
he
paused
and
scrambling
up
to
a
sitting
posture
looked
earnestly
into
dick
face
through
his
tearful
eyes
oh
non
non
he
exclaimed
stretching
himself
out
at
full
length
again
and
closing
his
eyes
it
are
too
goot
to
be
true
i
am
dream
i
vill
wait
till
i
am
wake
dick
roused
him
out
of
this
resolute
sleep
however
somewhat
roughly
meanwhile
joe
had
rubbed
and
kicked
himself
into
a
state
of
animation
exclaiming
that
he
felt
as
if
he
wos
walkin
on
a
thousand
needles
and
pins
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
ready
to
accompany
their
overjoyed
deliverer
back
to
the
peigan
camp
crusoe
testified
his
delight
in
various
elephantine
gambols
round
the
persons
of
his
old
friends
who
were
not
slow
to
acknowledge
his
services
they
have
treated
us
overly
well
remarked
joe
blunt
as
they
strode
through
the
underwood
non

niver

henri
we
be
quits
wi
them
now
said
joe
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
two
bands
who
remained
in
precisely
the
same
position
in
which
they
had
been
left
except
that
one
or
two
of
the
more
reckless
of
the
trappers
had
lit
their
pipes
and
taken
to
smoking
without
however
laying
down
their
rifles
or
taking
their
eyes
off
the
savages
a
loud
cheer
greeted
the
arrival
of
the
prisoners
and
looks
of
considerable
discomfort
began
to
be
evinced
by
the
indians
glad
to
see
you
friends
said
cameron
as
they
came
up
ve
is
ov
de
same
replied
henri
swaggering
up
in
the
joviality
of
his
heart
and
seizing
the
trader
hand
in
his
own
enormous
fist

or

we
consider
that
afterwards
my
lad
meantime
go
you
to
the
rear
and
get
a
weapon
of
some
sort
oui
ah
charmant
he
cried
going
with
an
immense
flounder
into
the
midst
of
the
amused
trappers
and
slapping
those
next
to
him
on
the
back
give

gun
pistol
anyting
cannon
if
you
have
von
meanwhile
cameron
and
joe
spoke
together
for
a
few
moments
you
had
goods
with
you
and
horses
i
believe
when
you
were
captured
said
the
former
ay
that
we
had
yonder
stand
the
horses
under
the
along
wi
the
rest
o
the
redskin
troop
an
a
hard
time
they
had
as
their
bones
may
tell
without
speakin
as
for
the
goods
he
continued
glancing
round
the
camp
i
do
know
where
ah
yes
there
they
be
in
the
old
pack
i
see
all
safe
cameron
now
addressed
the
indians
the
peigans
he
said
have
not
done
well
their
hearts
have
not
been
true
to
the
even
now
i
could
take
your
scalps
where
you
sit
but
white
men
do
not
like
war
they
do
not
like
revenge
the
peigans
may
go
free
considering
the
fewness
of
their
numbers
this
was
bold
language
to
use
towards
the
indians
but
the
boldest
is
generally
the
best
policy
on
such
occasions
moreover
cameron
felt
that
being
armed
with
rifles
while
the
indians
had
only
bows
and
arrows
the
trappers
had
a
great
advantage
over
them
the
indian
who
had
spoken
before
now
rose
and
said
he
was
sorry
there
should
be
any
cause
of
difference
between
them
and
added
he
was
sorry
for
a
great
many
more
things
besides
but
he
did
not
say
he
was
sorry
for
having
told
a
lie
but
before
you
go
you
must
deliver
up
the
horses
and
goods
belonging
to
these
men
said
cameron
pointing
to
joe
and
henri
this
was
agreed
to
the
horses
were
led
out
the
two
little
packs
containing
joe
goods
were
strapped
upon
them
and
then
the
trappers
turned
to
depart
the
indians
did
not
move
until
they
had
mounted
then
they
rose
and
advanced
in
a
body
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
to
see
the
go
away
meanwhile
joe
spoke
a
few
words
to
cameron
and
the
men
were
ordered
to
halt
while
the
former
dismounted
and
led
his
horse
towards
the
band
of
savages
peigans
he
said
you
know
the
object
for
which
i
came
into
this
country
was
to
make
peace
between
you
and
the
i
have
often
told
you
so
when
you
would
not
listen
and
when
you
told
me
that
i
had
a
double
heart
and
told
lies
you
were
wrong
when
you
said
this
but
i
do
not
wonder
for
you
live
among
nations
who
do
not
fear
god
and
who
think
it
right
to
lie
i
now
repeat
to
you
what
i
said
before
it
would
be
good
for
the
if
they
would
make
peace
with
the
and
if
they
would
make
peace
with
each
other
i
will
now
convince
you
that
i
am
in
earnest
and
have
all
along
been
speaking
the
truth
hereupon
joe
blunt
opened
his
bundle
of
goods
and
presented
fully
of
the
gaudy
and
brilliant
contents
to
the
astonished
indians
who
seemed
quite
taken
aback
by
such
generous
treatment
the
result
of
this
was
that
the
two
parties
separated
with
mutual
expressions
of
esteem
and
the
indians
then
returned
to
the
forest
and
the
white
men
galloped
back
to
their
camp
among
the
hills
chapter
xx
travellers
join
the
and
see
many
strange
curious
narrow
escape
and
a
prisoner
not
long
after
the
events
related
in
the
last
chapter
our
four
friends
dick
and
joe
and
henri
and
crusoe
agreed
to
become
for
a
time
members
of
walter
cameron
band
of
trappers
joe
joined
because
one
of
the
objects
which
the
traders
had
in
view
was
similar
to
his
own
mission
namely
the
promoting
of
peace
among
the
various
indian
tribes
of
the
mountains
and
plains
to
the
west
joe
therefore
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
of
travelling
with
a
band
of
men
who
could
secure
him
a
favourable
hearing
from
the
indian
tribes
they
might
chance
to
meet
with
in
the
course
of
their
wanderings
besides
as
the
traders
carried
about
a
large
supply
of
goods
with
them
he
could
easily
replenish
his
own
nearly
exhausted
pack
by
hunting
wild
animals
and
exchanging
their
skins
for
such
articles
as
he
might
require
dick
joined
because
it
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
wild
majestic
scenery
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
shooting
the
sheep
which
abounded
there
and
the
grizzly
bars
as
joe
named
them
or
caleb
as
they
were
more
frequently
styled
by
henri
and
the
other
men
henri
joined
because
it
was
agreeable
to
the
inclination
of
his
own
rollicking
blundering
floundering
crashing
disposition
and
because
he
would
have
joined
anything
that
had
been
joined
by
the
other
two
crusoe
reason
for
joining
was
single
simple
easy
to
be
expressed
easy
to
be
understood
and
commendable
joined
because
dick
did
the
very
day
after
the
party
left
the
encampment
where
dick
had
shot
the
grizzly
bear
and
the
deer
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
bringing
down
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
sheep
it
came
suddenly
out
from
a
gorge
of
the
mountain
and
stood
upon
the
giddy
edge
of
a
tremendous
precipice
at
a
distance
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
could
not
hit
that
said
a
trapper
to
henri
who
was
rather
fond
of
jeering
him
about
his
shortsightedness
non
cried
henri
who
did
see
the
animal
in
the
least
say
you
dat
ve
shall
see
and
he
let
fly
with
a
promptitude
that
amazed
his
comrades
and
with
a
result
that
drew
from
them
peals
of
laughter
why
you
have
missed
the
mountain
oh
non
dat
am
eempossoble
it
was
true
nevertheless
for
his
ball
had
been
arrested
in
its
flight
by
the
stem
of
a
tree
not
twenty
yards
before
him
while
the
shot
was
yet
ringing
and
before
the
laugh
above
referred
to
had
pealed
forth
dick
varley
fired
and
the
animal
springing
wildly
into
the
air
fell
down
the
precipice
and
was
almost
dashed
to
pieces
at
their
feet
this
rocky
mountain
or
sheep
was
a
particularly
large
and
fine
one
but
being
a
patriarch
of
the
flock
was
not
well
suited
for
food
it
was
considerably
larger
in
size
than
the
domestic
sheep
and
might
be
described
as
somewhat
resembling
a
deer
in
the
body
and
a
ram
in
the
head
its
horns
were
the
chief
point
of
interest
to
dick
and
truly
they
were
astounding
their
enormous
size
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
animal
body
and
they
curved
backwards
and
downwards
and
then
curled
up
again
in
a
sharp
point
these
creatures
frequent
the
inaccessible
heights
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
are
difficult
to
approach
they
have
a
great
fondness
for
salt
and
pay
regular
visits
to
the
numerous
caverns
of
these
mountains
which
are
encrusted
with
a
saline
substance
walter
cameron
now
changed
his
intention
of
proceeding
to
the
eastward
as
he
found
the
country
not
so
full
of
beaver
at
that
particular
spot
as
he
had
anticipated
he
therefore
turned
towards
the
west
penetrated
into
the
interior
of
the
mountains
and
took
a
considerable
sweep
through
the
lovely
valleys
on
their
western
slopes
the
expedition
which
this
enterprising
was
conducting
was
one
of
the
first
that
ever
penetrated
these
wild
regions
in
search
of
furs
the
ground
over
which
they
travelled
was
quite
new
to
them
and
having
no
guide
they
just
moved
about
at
haphazard
encamping
on
the
margin
of
every
stream
or
river
on
which
signs
of
the
presence
of
beaver
were
discovered
and
setting
their
traps
beaver
skins
at
this
time
were
worth
in
the
markets
of
civilized
lands
and
in
the
snake
country
through
which
our
friends
were
travelling
thousands
of
them
were
to
be
had
from
the
indians
for
trinkets
and
baubles
that
were
scarce
worth
a
farthing
a
beaver
skin
could
be
procured
from
the
indians
for
a
brass
or
a
penny
horses
were
also
so
numerous
that
one
could
be
procured
for
an
axe
or
a
knife
let
not
the
reader
however
hastily
conclude
that
the
traders
cheated
the
indians
in
this
traffic
though
the
profits
were
so
enormous
the
ring
or
the
axe
was
indeed
a
trifle
to
the
trader
but
the
beaver
skin
and
the
horse
were
equally
trifles
to
the
savage
who
could
procure
as
many
of
them
as
he
chose
with
very
little
trouble
while
the
ring
and
the
axe
were
in
his
estimation
of
priceless
value
besides
be
it
remembered
to
carry
that
ring
and
that
axe
to
the
haunts
of
the
cost
the
trader
weeks
and
months
of
constant
toil
trouble
anxiety
and
alas
too
frequently
cost
him
his
life
the
state
of
trade
is
considerably
modified
in
these
regions
at
the
present
day
it
is
not
more
conducted
for
in
respect
of
the
value
of
goods
given
for
furs
it
was
justly
conducted
but
time
and
circumstances
have
tended
more
to
equalize
the
relative
values
of
articles
of
trade
the
snow
which
had
prematurely
fallen
had
passed
away
and
the
trappers
now
found
themselves
wandering
about
in
a
country
so
beautiful
and
a
season
so
delightful
that
it
would
have
seemed
to
them
a
perfect
paradise
but
for
the
savage
tribes
who
hovered
about
them
and
kept
them
ever
on
the
they
soon
passed
from
the
immediate
embrace
of
stupendous
heights
and
dark
gorges
to
a
land
of
sloping
ridges
which
divided
the
country
into
a
hundred
luxuriant
vales
composed
part
of
woodland
and
part
of
prairie
through
these
numerous
rivers
and
streams
flowed
deviously
beautifying
the
landscape
and
enriching
the
land
there
were
also
many
lakes
of
all
sizes
and
these
swarmed
with
fish
while
in
some
of
them
were
found
the
and
beaver
salt
springs
and
hot
springs
of
various
temperatures
abounded
here
and
many
of
the
latter
were
so
hot
that
meat
could
be
boiled
in
them
salt
existed
in
all
directions
in
abundance
and
of
good
quality
a
sulphurous
spring
was
also
discovered
bubbling
out
from
the
base
of
a
perpendicular
rock
three
hundred
feet
high
the
waters
of
which
were
and
tasted
like
gunpowder
in
short
the
land
presented
every
variety
of
feature
calculated
to
charm
the
imagination
and
delight
the
eye
it
was
a
mysterious
land
too
for
broad
rivers
burst
in
many
places
from
the
earth
flowed
on
for
a
short
space
and
then
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
into
the
earth
from
which
they
rose
natural
bridges
spanned
the
torrents
in
many
places
and
some
of
these
were
so
correctly
formed
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
they
had
not
been
built
by
the
hand
of
man
they
often
appeared
opportunely
to
our
trappers
and
saved
them
the
trouble
and
danger
of
fording
rivers
frequently
the
whole
band
would
stop
in
silent
wonder
and
awe
as
they
listened
to
the
rushing
of
waters
under
their
feet
as
if
another
world
of
streams
and
rapids
and
cataracts
were
flowing
below
the
crust
of
earth
on
which
they
stood
some
considerable
streams
were
likewise
observed
to
gush
from
the
faces
of
precipices
some
twenty
or
thirty
feet
from
their
summits
while
on
the
top
no
water
was
to
be
seen
wild
berries
of
all
kinds
were
found
in
abundance
and
wild
vegetables
besides
many
nutritious
roots
among
other
fish
splendid
salmon
were
found
in
the
lakes
and
rivers
and
animal
life
swarmed
on
hill
and
in
dale
woods
and
valleys
plains
and
ravines
teemed
with
it
on
every
plain
the
grazed
in
herds
by
the
banks
of
lake
and
stream
wherever
there
were
clusters
of
poplar
and
elder
trees
and
saplings
the
beaver
was
seen
nibbling
industriously
with
his
sharp
teeth
and
committing
as
much
havoc
in
the
forest
as
if
he
had
been
armed
with
the
woodman
axe
others
sported
in
the
eddies
racoons
sat
in
the
the
marten
the
black
fox
and
the
wolf
prowled
in
the
woods
in
quest
of
prey
mountain
sheep
and
goats
browsed
on
the
rocky
ridges
and
badgers
peeped
from
their
holes
here
too
the
wild
horse
sprang
snorting
and
dishevelled
from
his
mountain
retreats
with
flourishing
mane
and
tail
spanking
step
and
questioning
gaze
and
thundered
away
over
the
plains
and
valleys
while
the
rocks
echoed
back
his
shrill
neigh
the
huge
heavy
ungainly
elk
or
away
from
the
travellers
with
speed
equal
to
that
of
the
mustang
elks
seldom
gallop
their
best
speed
is
attained
at
the
trot
bears
too
black
and
brown
and
grizzly
roamed
about
everywhere
so
numerous
were
all
these
creatures
that
on
one
occasion
the
hunters
of
the
party
brought
in
six
wild
horses
three
bears
four
elks
and
thirty
having
shot
them
all
a
short
distance
ahead
of
the
main
body
and
almost
without
diverging
from
the
line
of
march
and
this
was
a
matter
of
everyday
occurrence
as
it
had
need
to
be
considering
the
number
of
mouths
that
had
to
be
filled
the
feathered
tribes
were
not
less
numerous
chief
among
these
were
eagles
and
vultures
of
uncommon
size
the
wild
goose
wild
duck
and
the
majestic
swan
in
the
midst
of
such
profusion
the
trappers
spent
a
happy
time
of
it
when
not
molested
by
the
savages
but
they
frequently
lost
a
horse
or
two
in
consequence
of
the
expertness
of
these
thievish
fellows
they
often
wandered
however
for
days
at
a
time
without
seeing
an
indian
and
at
such
times
they
enjoyed
to
the
full
the
luxuries
with
which
a
bountiful
god
had
blessed
these
romantic
regions
dick
varley
was
almost
wild
with
delight
it
was
his
first
excursion
into
the
remote
wilderness
he
was
young
healthy
strong
and
romantic
and
it
is
a
question
whether
his
or
his
dog
heart
or
that
of
the
noble
wild
horse
he
bestrode
bounded
most
with
joy
at
the
glorious
sights
and
sounds
and
influences
by
which
they
were
surrounded
it
would
have
been
perfection
had
it
not
been
for
the
frequent
annoyance
and
alarms
caused
by
the
indians
alas
alas
that
we
who
write
and
read
about
those
wondrous
scenes
should
have
to
condemn
our
own
species
as
the
most
degraded
of
all
the
works
of
the
creator
there
yet
so
it
is
man
exercising
his
reason
and
conscience
in
the
path
of
love
and
duty
which
his
creator
points
out
is
god
noblest
work
but
man
left
to
the
freedom
of
his
own
fallen
will
sinks
morally
lower
than
the
beasts
that
perish
well
may
every
christian
wish
and
pray
that
the
name
and
the
gospel
of
the
blessed
jesus
may
be
sent
speedily
to
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
for
you
may
read
of
and
talk
about
but
you
the
fiendish
wickedness
and
cruelty
which
causes
tearless
eyes
to
glare
and
maddened
hearts
to
burst
in
the
lands
of
the
heathen
while
we
are
on
this
subject
let
us
add
and
our
young
readers
will
come
to
know
it
if
they
are
spared
to
see
many
years
that
alone
will
never
improve
the
heart
let
history
speak
and
it
will
tell
you
that
deeds
of
darkest
hue
have
been
perpetrated
in
civilized
though
pagan
lands
civilization
is
like
the
polish
that
beautifies
inferior
furniture
which
water
will
wash
off
if
it
be
but
christianity
resembles
dye
which
permeates
every
fibre
of
the
fabric
and
which
nothing
can
eradicate
the
success
of
the
trappers
in
procuring
beaver
here
was
great
in
all
sorts
of
creeks
and
rivers
they
were
found
one
day
they
came
to
one
of
the
curious
rivers
before
mentioned
which
burst
suddenly
out
of
a
plain
flowed
on
for
several
miles
and
then
disappeared
into
the
earth
as
suddenly
as
it
had
risen
even
in
this
strange
place
beaver
were
seen
so
the
traps
were
set
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
were
caught
at
the
first
lift
the
manner
in
which
the
party
proceeded
was
as
follows
they
marched
in
a
mass
in
groups
or
in
a
long
line
according
to
the
nature
of
the
ground
over
which
they
travelled
the
hunters
of
the
party
went
forward
a
mile
or
two
in
advance
and
scattered
through
the
woods
after
them
came
the
being
the
bravest
and
most
stalwart
of
the
men
mounted
on
their
best
steeds
and
with
rifle
in
hand
immediately
behind
followed
the
women
and
children
also
mounted
and
the
with
the
goods
and
camp
equipage
another
band
of
trappers
formed
the
to
this
imposing
cavalcade
there
was
no
strict
regimental
order
kept
but
the
people
soon
came
to
adopt
the
arrangements
that
were
most
convenient
for
all
parties
and
at
length
fell
naturally
into
their
places
in
the
line
of
march
joe
blunt
usually
was
the
foremost
and
always
the
most
successful
of
the
hunters
he
was
therefore
seldom
seen
on
the
march
except
at
the
hour
of
starting
and
at
night
when
he
came
back
leading
his
horse
which
always
groaned
under
its
heavy
load
of
meat
henri
being
a
hearty
jovial
soul
and
fond
of
society
usually
kept
with
the
main
body
as
for
dick
he
was
everywhere
at
once
at
least
as
much
so
as
it
is
possible
for
human
nature
to
be
his
horse
never
wearied
it
seemed
to
delight
in
going
at
full
speed
no
other
horse
in
the
troop
could
come
near
charlie
and
dick
indulged
him
by
appearing
now
at
the
front
now
at
the
rear
anon
in
the
centre
and
frequently
having
gone
off
with
crusoe
like
a
flash
of
lightning
after
a
buffalo
or
a
deer
dick
soon
proved
himself
to
be
the
best
hunter
of
the
party
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
fulfilled
his
promise
to
crusoe
and
decorated
his
neck
with
a
collar
of
grizzly
bear
claws
well
when
the
trappers
came
to
a
river
where
there
were
signs
of
beaver
they
called
a
halt
and
proceeded
to
select
a
safe
and
convenient
spot
near
wood
and
water
for
the
camp
here
the
property
of
the
band
was
securely
piled
in
such
a
manner
as
to
form
a
breastwork
or
slight
fortification
and
here
walter
cameron
established
headquarters
this
was
always
the
post
of
danger
being
exposed
to
sudden
attack
by
prowling
savages
who
often
dogged
the
footsteps
of
the
party
in
their
journeyings
to
see
what
they
could
steal
but
cameron
was
an
old
hand
and
they
found
it
difficult
to
escape
his
vigilant
eye
from
this
point
all
the
trappers
were
sent
forth
in
small
parties
every
morning
in
various
directions
some
on
foot
and
some
on
horseback
according
to
the
distances
they
had
to
go
but
they
never
went
farther
than
twenty
miles
as
they
had
to
return
to
camp
every
evening
each
trapper
had
ten
steel
traps
allowed
him
these
he
set
every
night
and
visited
every
morning
sometimes
oftener
when
practicable
selecting
a
spot
in
the
stream
where
many
trees
had
been
cut
down
by
beavers
for
the
purpose
of
damming
up
the
water
in
some
places
as
many
as
fifty
tree
stumps
were
seen
in
one
spot
within
the
compass
of
half
an
acre
all
cut
through
at
about
eighteen
inches
from
the
root
we
may
remark
in
passing
that
the
beaver
is
very
much
like
a
gigantic
with
this
marked
difference
that
its
tail
is
very
broad
and
flat
like
a
paddle
the
said
tail
is
a
article
of
food
as
indeed
is
the
whole
body
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
the
beaver
fore
legs
are
very
small
and
short
and
it
uses
its
paws
as
hands
to
convey
food
to
its
mouth
sitting
the
while
in
an
erect
position
on
its
hind
legs
and
tail
its
fur
is
a
dense
coat
of
a
down
concealed
by
long
coarse
hair
which
lies
smooth
and
is
of
a
bright
chestnut
colour
its
teeth
and
jaws
are
of
enormous
power
with
them
it
can
cut
through
the
branch
of
a
tree
as
thick
as
a
at
one
snap
and
as
we
have
said
it
gnaws
through
thick
trees
themselves
as
soon
as
a
tree
falls
the
beavers
set
to
work
industriously
to
lop
off
the
branches
which
as
well
as
the
smaller
trunks
they
cut
into
lengths
according
to
their
weight
and
thickness
these
are
then
dragged
by
main
force
to
the
launched
and
floated
to
their
destination
beavers
build
their
houses
or
lodges
under
the
banks
of
rivers
and
lakes
and
always
select
those
of
such
depth
of
water
that
there
is
no
danger
of
their
being
frozen
to
the
bottom
when
such
can
not
be
found
and
they
are
compelled
to
build
in
small
rivulets
of
insufficient
depth
these
clever
little
creatures
dam
up
the
waters
until
they
are
deep
enough
the
banks
thrown
up
by
them
across
rivulets
for
this
purpose
are
of
great
strength
and
would
do
credit
to
human
engineers
their
lodges
are
built
of
sticks
mud
and
stones
which
form
a
compact
mass
this
freezes
solid
in
winter
and
defies
the
assaults
of
that
housebreaker
the
wolverine
an
animal
which
is
the
beaver
implacable
foe
from
this
lodge
which
is
capable
often
of
holding
four
old
and
six
or
eight
young
ones
a
communication
is
maintained
with
the
water
below
the
ice
so
that
should
the
wolverine
succeed
in
breaking
up
the
lodge
he
finds
the
family
not
at
home
they
having
made
good
their
retreat
by
the
when
man
acts
the
part
of
housebreaker
however
he
cunningly
shuts
the
by
driving
stakes
through
the
ice
and
thus
stopping
the
passage
then
he
enters
and
we
almost
regret
to
say
finds
the
family
at
home
we
regret
it
because
the
beaver
is
a
gentle
peaceable
affectionate
hairy
little
creature
towards
which
one
feels
an
irresistible
tenderness
but
to
return
from
this
long
digression
our
trappers
having
selected
their
several
localities
set
their
traps
in
the
water
so
that
when
the
beavers
roamed
about
at
night
they
put
their
feet
into
them
and
were
caught
and
drowned
for
although
they
can
swim
and
dive
admirably
they
can
not
live
altogether
under
water
thus
the
different
parties
proceeded
and
in
the
mornings
the
camp
was
a
busy
scene
indeed
for
then
the
whole
were
engaged
in
skinning
the
animals
the
skins
were
always
stretched
dried
folded
up
with
the
hair
in
the
inside
and
laid
by
and
the
flesh
was
used
for
food
but
oftentimes
the
trappers
had
to
go
forth
with
the
gun
in
one
hand
and
their
traps
in
the
other
while
they
kept
a
sharp
on
the
bushes
to
guard
against
surprise
despite
their
utmost
efforts
a
horse
was
occasionally
stolen
before
their
very
eyes
and
sometimes
even
an
unfortunate
trapper
was
murdered
and
all
his
traps
carried
off
an
event
of
this
kind
occurred
soon
after
the
party
had
gained
the
western
slopes
of
the
mountains
three
iroquois
indians
who
belonged
to
the
band
of
trappers
were
sent
to
a
stream
about
ten
miles
off
having
reached
their
destination
they
all
entered
the
water
to
set
their
traps
foolishly
neglecting
the
usual
precaution
of
one
remaining
on
the
bank
to
protect
the
others
they
had
scarcely
commenced
operations
when
three
arrows
were
discharged
into
their
backs
and
a
party
of
snake
indians
rushed
upon
and
slew
them
carrying
away
their
traps
and
horses
and
scalps
this
was
not
known
for
several
days
when
becoming
anxious
about
their
prolonged
absence
cameron
sent
out
a
party
which
found
their
mangled
bodies
affording
a
loathsome
banquet
to
the
wolves
and
vultures
after
this
sad
event
the
trappers
were
more
careful
to
go
in
larger
parties
and
keep
watch
as
long
as
beaver
were
taken
in
abundance
the
camp
remained
stationary
but
whenever
the
beaver
began
to
grow
scarce
the
camp
was
raised
and
the
party
moved
on
to
another
valley
one
day
dick
varley
came
galloping
into
camp
with
the
news
that
there
were
several
bears
in
a
valley
not
far
distant
which
he
was
anxious
not
to
disturb
until
a
number
of
the
trappers
were
collected
together
to
go
out
and
surround
them
on
receiving
the
information
walter
cameron
shook
his
head
we
have
other
things
to
do
young
man
said
he
than
go
after
bears
i
just
about
making
up
my
mind
to
send
off
a
party
to
search
out
the
valley
on
the
other
side
of
the
blue
mountains
yonder
and
bring
back
word
if
there
are
beaver
there
for
if
not
i
mean
to
strike
away
direct
south
now
if
you
a
mind
to
go
with
them
you
welcome
i
warrant
you
find
enough
in
the
way
of
to
satisfy
you
perhaps
a
little
indian
hunting
to
boot
for
if
the
banattees
get
hold
of
your
horses
you
have
a
long
hunt
before
you
find
them
again
will
you
go
ay
right
gladly
replied
dick
when
do
we
start
this
afternoon
dick
went
off
at
once
to
his
own
part
of
the
camp
to
replenish
his
and
and
wipe
out
his
rifle
that
evening
the
party
under
command
of
a
canadian
named
pierre
set
out
for
the
blue
hills
they
numbered
twenty
men
and
expected
to
be
absent
three
days
for
they
merely
went
to
reconnoitre
not
to
trap
neither
joe
nor
henri
was
of
this
party
both
having
been
out
hunting
when
it
was
organized
but
crusoe
and
charlie
were
of
course
pierre
although
a
brave
and
trusty
man
was
of
a
sour
angry
disposition
and
not
a
favourite
with
dick
but
the
latter
resolved
to
enjoy
himself
and
disregard
his
sulky
comrade
being
so
well
mounted
he
not
unfrequently
shot
far
ahead
of
his
companions
despite
their
warnings
that
he
ran
great
risk
by
so
doing
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
and
crusoe
witnessed
a
very
singular
fight
which
is
worthy
of
record
dick
had
felt
a
little
wilder
in
spirit
that
morning
than
usual
and
on
coming
to
a
pretty
open
plain
he
gave
the
rein
to
charlie
and
with
an
mes
he
was
out
of
sight
in
a
few
minutes
he
rode
on
several
miles
in
advance
without
checking
speed
and
then
came
to
a
wood
where
rapid
motion
was
inconvenient
so
he
pulled
up
and
dismounting
tied
charlie
to
a
tree
while
he
sauntered
on
a
short
way
on
foot
on
coming
to
the
edge
of
a
small
plain
he
observed
two
large
birds
engaged
in
mortal
conflict
crusoe
observed
them
too
and
would
soon
have
put
an
end
to
the
fight
had
dick
not
checked
him
creeping
as
close
to
the
belligerents
as
possible
he
found
that
one
was
a
wild
the
other
a
eagle
these
two
stood
with
their
heads
down
and
all
their
feathers
bristling
for
a
moment
then
they
dashed
at
each
other
and
struck
fiercely
with
their
spurs
as
our
domestic
cocks
do
but
neither
fell
and
the
fight
was
continued
for
about
five
minutes
without
apparent
advantage
on
either
side
dick
now
observed
that
from
the
uncertainty
of
its
motions
the
was
blind
a
discovery
which
caused
a
throb
of
compunction
to
enter
his
breast
for
standing
and
looking
on
so
he
ran
forward
the
eagle
saw
him
instantly
and
tried
to
fly
away
but
was
unable
from
exhaustion
at
him
crusoe
cried
dick
whose
sympathies
all
lay
with
the
other
bird
crusoe
went
forward
at
a
bound
and
was
met
by
a
peck
between
the
eyes
that
would
have
turned
most
dogs
but
crusoe
only
winked
and
the
next
moment
the
eagle
career
was
ended
dick
found
that
the
was
quite
blind
the
eagle
having
thrust
out
both
its
eyes
so
in
mercy
he
put
an
end
to
its
sufferings
the
fight
had
evidently
been
a
long
and
severe
one
for
the
grass
all
round
the
spot
for
about
twenty
yards
was
beaten
to
the
ground
and
covered
with
the
blood
and
feathers
of
the
fierce
combatants
meditating
on
the
fight
which
he
had
just
witnessed
dick
returned
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
left
charlie
when
he
suddenly
missed
crusoe
from
his
side
hallo
crusoe
here
pup
where
are
you
he
cried
the
only
answer
to
this
was
a
sharp
whizzing
sound
and
an
arrow
passing
close
to
his
ear
quivered
in
a
tree
beyond
almost
at
the
same
moment
crusoe
angry
roar
was
followed
by
a
shriek
from
some
one
in
fear
or
agony
cocking
his
rifle
the
young
hunter
sprang
through
the
bushes
towards
his
horse
and
was
just
in
time
to
save
a
banattee
indian
from
being
strangled
by
the
dog
it
had
evidently
scented
out
this
fellow
and
pinned
him
just
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
springing
on
the
back
of
charlie
for
the
halter
was
cut
and
the
savage
lay
on
the
ground
close
beside
him
dick
called
off
the
dog
and
motioned
to
the
indian
to
rise
which
he
did
so
nimbly
that
it
was
quite
evident
he
had
sustained
no
injury
beyond
the
laceration
of
his
neck
by
crusoe
teeth
and
the
surprise
he
was
a
tall
strong
indian
for
the
tribe
to
which
he
belonged
so
dick
proceeded
to
secure
him
at
once
pointing
to
his
rifle
and
to
the
indian
breast
to
show
what
he
might
expect
if
he
attempted
to
escape
dick
ordered
crusoe
to
keep
him
steady
in
that
position
the
dog
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
savage
who
began
to
tremble
for
his
scalp
and
gazed
up
in
his
face
with
a
look
which
to
say
the
least
of
it
was
the
reverse
of
amiable
while
dick
went
towards
his
horse
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
a
piece
of
cord
to
tie
him
with
the
indian
naturally
turned
his
head
to
see
what
was
going
to
be
done
but
a
peculiar
in
crusoe
throat
made
him
turn
it
round
again
very
smartly
and
he
did
not
venture
thereafter
to
move
a
muscle
in
a
few
seconds
dick
returned
with
a
piece
of
leather
and
tied
his
hands
behind
his
back
while
this
was
being
done
the
indian
glanced
several
times
at
his
bow
which
lay
a
few
feet
away
where
it
had
fallen
when
the
dog
caught
him
but
crusoe
seemed
to
understand
him
for
he
favoured
him
with
such
an
additional
display
of
teeth
and
such
a
low
apparently
distant
almost
we
might
say
subterranean
that
he
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
his
hands
secured
a
long
line
was
attached
to
his
neck
with
a
running
noose
so
that
if
he
ventured
to
run
away
the
attempt
would
effect
its
own
cure
by
producing
strangulation
the
other
end
of
this
line
was
given
to
crusoe
who
at
the
word
of
command
marched
him
off
while
dick
mounted
charlie
and
brought
up
the
rear
great
was
the
laughter
and
merriment
when
this
apparition
met
the
eyes
of
the
trappers
but
when
they
heard
that
he
had
attempted
to
shoot
dick
their
ire
was
raised
and
a
was
held
on
the
spot
hang
the
reptile
cried
one
burn
him
shouted
another
no
no
said
a
third
do
imitate
them
villains
do
be
cruel
let
shoot
him
shoot
cried
pierre
oui

it
too
goot
pour
lui
mais
it
shall
be
dooed
do
ye
think
lads
it
would
be
better
to
let
the
poor
wretch
off
said
dick
varley
he
give
a
good
account
o
us
to
his
people
there
was
a
universal
shout
of
contempt
at
this
mild
proposal
unfortunately
few
of
the
men
sent
on
this
exploring
expedition
were
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
their
chief
and
most
of
them
seemed
glad
to
have
a
chance
of
venting
their
hatred
of
the
poor
indians
on
this
unhappy
wretch
who
although
calm
looked
sharply
from
one
speaker
to
another
to
gather
hope
if
possible
from
the
tones
of
their
voices
dick
was
resolved
at
the
risk
of
a
quarrel
with
pierre
to
save
the
poor
man
life
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
insist
on
having
him
conducted
to
the
camp
to
be
tried
by
cameron
when
one
of
the
men
suggested
that
they
should
take
the
savage
to
the
top
of
a
hill
about
three
miles
farther
on
and
there
hang
him
up
on
a
tree
as
a
warning
to
all
his
tribe
agreed
agreed
cried
the
men
come
on
dick
too
seemed
to
agree
to
this
proposal
and
hastily
ordered
crusoe
to
run
on
ahead
with
the
savage
an
order
which
the
dog
obeyed
so
vigorously
that
before
the
men
had
done
laughing
at
him
he
was
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
ahead
of
them
take
care
that
he
do
get
off
cried
dick
springing
on
charlie
and
stretching
out
at
a
gallop
in
a
moment
he
was
beside
the
indian
scraping
together
the
little
of
the
indian
language
he
knew
he
stooped
down
and
cutting
the
thongs
that
bound
him
said
go
white
men
love
the
indians
the
man
cast
on
his
deliverer
one
glance
of
surprise
and
the
next
moment
bounded
aside
into
the
bushes
and
was
gone
a
loud
shout
from
the
party
behind
showed
that
this
act
had
been
observed
and
crusoe
stood
with
the
end
of
the
line
in
his
mouth
and
an
expression
on
his
face
that
said
you
absolutely
incomprehensible
dick
it
all
right
i
but
to
my
feeble
capacity
it
wrong
fat
for
you

shouted
pierre
in
a
rage
as
he
came
up
with
a
menacing
look
dick
confronted
him
the
prisoner
was
mine
i
had
a
right
to
do
with
him
as
it
liked
me
true
true
cried
several
of
the
men
who
had
begun
to
repent
of
their
resolution
and
were
glad
the
savage
was
off
the
lad

dick
looked
pierre
in
the
face
as
he
said
this
in
a
manner
that
cowed
him
it
is
time
he
said
quietly
pointing
to
the
sun
to
go
on
your
bourgeois
expects
that
time
wo
be
wasted
pierre
muttered
something
in
an
angry
tone
and
wheeling
round
his
horse
dashed
forward
at
full
gallop
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
men
the
trappers
encamped
that
night
on
the
edge
of
a
wide
grassy
plain
which
offered
such
tempting
food
for
the
horses
that
pierre
resolved
to
forego
his
usual
cautious
plan
of
picketing
them
close
to
the
camp
and
set
them
loose
on
the
plain
merely
hobbling
them
to
prevent
their
straying
far
dick
remonstrated
but
in
vain
an
insolent
answer
was
all
he
got
for
his
pains
he
determined
however
to
keep
charlie
close
beside
him
all
night
and
also
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
a
sharp
on
the
other
horses
at
supper
he
again
remonstrated
no
said
pierre
whose
pipe
was
beginning
to
improve
his
temper
the
red
reptiles
no

to
come

said
a
taciturn
trapper
who
seldom
ventured
a
remark
of
any
kind
them

the

eyes
out
o

this
was
received
with
a
shout
of
laughter
in
the
midst
of
which
an
appalling
yell
was
heard
and
as
if
by
magic
four
indians
were
seen
on
the
backs
of
four
of
the
best
horses
yelling
like
fiends
and
driving
all
the
other
horses
furiously
before
them
over
the
plain
how
they
got
there
was
a
complete
mystery
but
the
men
did
not
wait
to
consider
that
point
catching
up
their
guns
they
sprang
after
them
with
the
fury
of
madmen
and
were
quickly
scattered
far
and
wide
dick
ordered
crusoe
to
follow
and
help
the
men
and
turned
to
spring
on
the
back
of
charlie
but
at
that
moment
he
observed
an
indian
head
and
shoulders
rise
above
the
grass
not
fifty
yards
in
advance
from
him
so
without
hesitation
he
darted
forward
intending
to
pounce
upon
him
well
would
it
have
been
for
dick
varley
had
he
at
that
time
possessed
a
little
more
experience
of
the
wiles
and
stratagems
of
the
banattees
the
snake
nation
is
subdivided
into
several
tribes
of
which
those
inhabiting
the
rocky
mountains
called
the
banattees
are
the
most
perfidious
indeed
they
are
confessedly
the
banditti
of
the
hills
and
respect
neither
friend
nor
foe
but
rob
all
who
come
in
their
way
dick
reached
the
spot
where
the
indian
had
disappeared
in
less
than
a
minute
but
no
savage
was
to
be
seen
thinking
he
had
crept
ahead
he
ran
on
a
few
yards
farther
and
darted
about
hither
and
thither
while
his
eye
glanced
from
side
to
side
suddenly
a
shout
in
the
camp
attracted
his
attention
and
looking
back
he
beheld
the
savage
on
charlie
back
turning
to
fly
next
moment
he
was
off
and
away
far
beyond
the
hope
of
recovery
dick
had
left
his
rifle
in
the
camp
otherwise
the
savage
would
have
gone
but
a
short
way
as
it
was
dick
returned
and
sitting
down
on
a
mound
of
grass
stared
straight
before
him
with
a
feeling
akin
to
despair
even
crusoe
could
not
have
helped
him
had
he
been
there
for
nothing
on
four
legs
or
on
two
could
keep
pace
with
charlie
the
banattee
achieved
this
feat
by
adopting
a
stratagem
which
invariably
deceives
those
who
are
ignorant
of
their
habits
and
tactics
when
suddenly
pursued
the
banattee
sinks
into
the
grass
and
creeps
along
with
wonderful
rapidity
not
but
his
enemy
taking
care
however
to
avoid
him
so
that
when
the
pursuer
reaches
the
spot
where
the
pursued
is
supposed
to
be
hiding
he
hears
him
shout
a
yell
of
defiance
far
away
in
the
rear
it
was
thus
that
the
banattee
eluded
dick
and
gained
the
camp
almost
as
soon
as
the
other
reached
the
spot
where
he
had
disappeared
one
by
one
the
trappers
came
back
weary
raging
and
despairing
in
a
short
time
they
all
assembled
and
soon
began
to
reproach
each
other
ere
long
one
or
two
had
a
fight
which
resulted
in
several
bloody
noses
and
black
eyes
thus
adding
to
the
misery
which
one
would
think
had
been
bad
enough
without
such
additions
at
last
they
finished
their
suppers
and
their
pipes
and
then
lay
down
to
sleep
under
the
trees
till
morning
when
they
arose
in
a
particularly
silent
and
sulky
mood
rolled
up
their
blankets
strapped
their
things
on
their
shoulders
and
began
to
trudge
slowly
back
to
the
camp
on
foot

the
in

and
the
surprise
and
a
we
must
now
return
to
the
camp
where
walter
cameron
still
guarded
the
goods
and
the
men
pursued
their
trapping
avocations
here
seven
of
the
horses
had
been
killed
in
one
night
by
wolves
while
grazing
in
a
plain
close
to
the
camp
and
on
the
night
following
a
horse
that
had
strayed
was
also
torn
to
pieces
and
devoured
the
prompt
and
daring
manner
in
which
this
had
been
done
convinced
the
trader
that
white
wolves
had
unfortunately
scented
them
out
and
he
set
several
traps
in
the
hope
of
capturing
them
white
wolves
are
quite
distinct
from
the
ordinary
wolves
that
prowl
through
woods
and
plains
in
large
packs
they
are
much
larger
weighing
sometimes
as
much
as
a
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
but
they
are
comparatively
scarce
and
move
about
alone
or
in
small
bands
of
three
or
four
their
strength
is
enormous
and
they
are
so
fierce
that
they
do
not
hesitate
upon
occasions
to
attack
man
himself
their
method
of
killing
horses
is
very
deliberate
two
wolves
generally
undertake
the
murder
they
approach
their
victim
with
the
most
and
frolicsome
gambols
lying
down
and
rolling
about
and
frisking
presently
until
the
horse
becomes
a
little
accustomed
to
them
then
one
approaches
right
in
front
the
other
in
rear
still
frisking
playfully
until
they
think
themselves
near
enough
when
they
make
a
simultaneous
rush
the
wolf
which
approaches
in
rear
is
the
true
assailant
the
rush
of
the
other
is
a
mere
feint
then
both
fasten
on
the
poor
horse
haunches
and
never
let
go
till
the
sinews
are
cut
and
he
is
rolling
on
his
side
the
horse
makes
comparatively
little
struggle
in
this
deadly
assault
he
seems
paralyzed
and
soon
falls
to
rise
no
more
cameron
set
his
traps
towards
evening
in
a
circle
with
a
bait
in
the
centre
and
then
retired
to
rest
next
morning
he
called
joe
blunt
and
the
two
went
off
together
it
is
strange
that
these
rascally
white
wolves
should
be
so
bold
when
the
smaller
kinds
are
so
cowardly
remarked
cameron
as
they
walked
along
so
is
replied
joe
but
i
seed
them
other
chaps
bold
enough
too
in
the
prairie
when
they
were
in
large
packs
and
starvin
i
believe
the
small
wolves
follow
the
big
fellows
and
help
them
to
eat
what
they
kill
though
they
generally
sit
round
and
look
on
at
the
killing
hist
exclaimed
joe
cocking
his
gun
there
he
is
an
no
mistake
there
he
was
undoubtedly
a
wolf
of
the
largest
size
with
one
of
his
feet
in
the
trap
he
was
a
object
for
besides
his
immense
size
and
naturally
ferocious
aspect
his
white
hair
bristled
on
end
and
was
all
covered
with
streaks
and
spots
of
blood
from
his
bloody
jaws
in
his
efforts
to
escape
he
had
bitten
the
trap
until
he
had
broken
his
teeth
and
lacerated
his
gums
so
that
his
appearance
was
hideous
in
the
extreme
and
when
the
two
men
came
up
he
struggled
with
all
his
might
to
fly
at
them
cameron
and
joe
stood
looking
at
him
in
a
sort
of
wondering
admiration
we
better
put
a
ball
in
him
suggested
joe
after
a
time
mayhap
the
chain
wo
stand
sich
tugs
long
true
joe
if
it
break
we
might
get
an
ugly
nip
before
we
killed
him
so
saying
cameron
fired
into
the
wolf
head
and
killed
it
it
was
found
on
examination
that
four
wolves
had
been
in
the
traps
but
the
rest
had
escaped
two
of
them
however
had
gnawed
off
their
paws
and
left
them
lying
in
the
traps
after
this
the
big
wolves
did
not
trouble
them
again
the
same
afternoon
a
was
undertaken
which
cost
one
of
the
iroquois
his
life
it
happened
thus
while
cameron
and
joe
were
away
after
the
white
wolves
henri
came
floundering
into
camp
tossing
his
arms
like
a
maniac
and
shouting
that
seven
bars
wos
be
down
in
de
bush
close
by
it
chanced
that
this
was
an
idle
day
with
most
of
the
men
so
they
all
leaped
on
their
horses
and
taking
guns
and
knives
sallied
forth
to
give
battle
to
the
bears
arrived
at
the
scene
of
action
they
found
the
seven
bears
busily
engaged
in
digging
up
roots
so
the
men
separated
in
order
to
surround
them
and
then
closed
in
the
place
was
partly
open
and
partly
covered
with
thick
bushes
into
which
a
horseman
could
not
penetrate
the
moment
the
bears
got
wind
of
what
was
going
forward
they
made
off
as
fast
as
possible
and
then
commenced
a
scene
of
firing
galloping
and
yelling
that
defies
description
four
out
of
the
seven
were
shot
before
they
gained
the
bushes
the
other
three
were
wounded
but
made
good
their
retreat
as
their
places
of
shelter
however
were
like
islands
in
the
plain
they
had
no
chance
of
escaping
the
horsemen
now
dismounted
and
dashed
recklessly
into
the
bushes
where
they
soon
discovered
and
killed
two
of
the
bears
the
third
was
not
found
for
some
time
at
last
an
iroquois
came
upon
it
so
suddenly
that
he
had
not
time
to
point
his
gun
before
the
bear
sprang
upon
him
and
struck
him
to
the
earth
where
it
held
him
down
instantly
the
place
was
surrounded
by
eager
men
but
the
bushes
were
so
thick
and
the
fallen
trees
among
which
the
bear
stood
were
so
numerous
that
they
could
not
use
their
guns
without
running
the
risk
of
shooting
their
companion
most
of
them
drew
their
knives
and
seemed
about
to
rush
on
the
bear
with
these
but
the
monster
aspect
as
it
glared
around
was
so
terrible
that
they
held
back
for
a
moment
in
hesitation
at
this
moment
henri
who
had
been
at
some
distance
engaged
in
the
killing
of
one
of
the
other
bears
came
rushing
forward
after
his
own
peculiar
manner
ah
fat
is
eet
hay
de
bar
no
go
under
yit
just
then
his
eye
fell
on
the
wounded
iroquois
with
the
bear
above
him
and
he
uttered
a
yell
so
intense
in
tone
that
the
bear
himself
seemed
to
feel
that
something
decisive
was
about
to
be
done
at
last
henri
did
not
pause
but
with
a
flying
dash
he
sprang
like
a
spread
eagle
arms
and
legs
extended
right
into
the
bear
bosom
at
the
same
moment
he
sent
his
long
down
into
its
heart
but
bruin
is
proverbially
hard
to
kill
and
although
mortally
wounded
he
had
strength
enough
to
open
his
jaws
and
close
them
on
henri
neck
there
was
a
cry
of
horror
and
at
the
same
moment
a
volley
was
fired
at
the
bear
head
for
the
trappers
felt
that
it
was
better
to
risk
shooting
their
comrades
than
see
them
killed
before
their
eyes
fortunately
the
bullets
took
effect
and
tumbled
him
over
at
once
without
doing
damage
to
either
of
the
men
although
several
of
the
balls
just
grazed
henri
temple
and
carried
off
his
cap
although
uninjured
by
the
shot
the
poor
iroquois
had
not
escaped
scathless
from
the
paw
of
the
bear
his
scalp
was
torn
almost
off
and
hung
down
over
his
eyes
while
blood
streamed
down
his
face
he
was
conveyed
by
his
comrades
to
the
camp
where
he
lay
two
days
in
a
state
of
insensibility
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
revived
and
recovered
daily
afterwards
when
the
camp
moved
he
had
to
be
carried
but
in
the
course
of
two
months
he
was
as
well
as
ever
and
quite
as
fond
of
among
other
trophies
of
this
hunt
there
were
two
deer
and
a
buffalo
which
last
had
probably
strayed
from
the
herd
four
or
five
iroquois
were
round
this
animal
whetting
their
knives
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
it
up
when
henri
passed
so
he
turned
aside
to
watch
them
perform
the
operation
quite
regardless
of
the
fact
that
his
neck
and
face
were
covered
with
blood
which
flowed
from
one
or
two
small
punctures
made
by
the
bear
the
indians
began
by
taking
off
the
skin
which
certainly
did
not
occupy
them
more
than
five
minutes
then
they
cut
up
the
meat
and
made
a
pack
of
it
and
cut
out
the
tongue
which
is
somewhat
troublesome
as
that
member
requires
to
be
cut
out
from
under
the
jaw
of
the
animal
and
not
through
the
natural
opening
of
the
mouth
one
of
the
fore
legs
was
cut
off
at
the
knee
joint
and
this
was
used
as
a
hammer
with
which
to
break
the
skull
for
the
purpose
of
taking
out
the
brains
these
being
used
in
the
process
of
dressing
and
softening
the
animal
skin
an
axe
would
have
been
of
advantage
to
break
the
skull
but
in
the
hurry
of
rushing
to
the
attack
the
indians
had
forgotten
their
axes
so
they
adopted
the
common
fashion
of
using
the
hoof
as
a
hammer
the
shank
being
the
handle
the
whole
operation
of
flaying
cutting
up
and
packing
the
meat
did
not
occupy
more
than
twenty
minutes
before
leaving
the
ground
these
expert
butchers
treated
themselves
to
a
little
of
the
marrow
and
warm
liver
in
a
raw
state
cameron
and
joe
walked
up
to
the
group
while
they
were
indulging
in
this
little
feast
well
i
often
seen
that
eaten
but
i
never
could
do
it
myself
remarked
the
former
no
cried
joe
in
surprise
now
that
oncommon
i
on
raw
liver
an
for
two
or
three
days
at
a
time
when
we
wos
chased
by
the
camanchee
injuns
an
dare
to
make
a
fire
an
it
good
it
is
wo
ye
try
it
cameron
shook
his
head
no
thankee
i
not
refuse
when
i
ca
help
it
but
until
then
i
remain
in
happy
ignorance
of
how
good
it
is
well
it
strange
how
some
folk
ca
abide
anything
in
the
meat
way
they
bin
used
to
d
know
i
actually
knowed
men
from
the
cities
as
would
eat
a
bit
o
horseflesh
for
love
or
money
would
ye
believe
it
i
can
well
believe
that
joe
for
i
have
met
with
such
persons
myself
in
fact
they
are
rather
numerous
what
are
you
chuckling
at
joe
chucklin
if
ye
mean
be
that
in
to
myself
it
because
thinkin
o
a
chap

to
the
prairies
let
us
walk
back
to
the
camp
joe
and
you
can

me
about

continued
joe
he
comed
from
washington
but
i
never
could
make
out
right
whether
he
wos
a
government
man
or
not
anyhow
he
wos
a
pheelosopher
a
i
think
he
call
a
naturalist

cameron
ay
that
wos
more
like
it
well
he
wos
about
six
feet
two
in
his
moccasins
an
as
thin
as
a
ramrod
an
as
blind
as

leastways
he
had
weak
eyes
an
wore
green
spectacles
he
had
on
a
gray
coat
an
trousers
an
vest
an
cap
with
rid
whiskers
an
a
long
nose
as
rid
at
the
point
as
the
whiskers
wos
well
this
gentleman
engaged
me
an
another
hunter
to
go
a
trip
with
him
into
the
prairies
so
off
we
sot
one
fine
day
on
three
hosses
with
our
blankets
at
our
backs
we
wos
to
depend
on
the
rifle
for
victuals
at
first
i
thought
the
one
o
the
cruellest
beggars
as
iver
went
on
two
long
legs
for
he
used
to
go
about
everywhere
pokin
pins
through
all
the
beetles
an
flies
an
things
he
could
sot
eyes
on
an
stuck
them
in
a
box
but
he
told
me
he
comed
here
to
git
as
many
o
them
as
he
could
so
says
i
that
it
i
fill
yer
box
in
no
time

says
he
quite
pleased
like

says
i
an
galloped
off
to
a
place
as
was
filled
wi
all
sorts
o
crawlin
things
so
i
sets
to
work
an
whenever
i
seed
a
thing
crawlin
i
sot
my
fut
on
it
an
crushed
it
an
soon
filled
my
breast
pocket
i
cotched
a
lot
o
butterflies
too
an
stuffed
them
into
my
an
went
back
in
an
hour
or
two
an
showed
him
the
lot
he
put
on
his
green
spectacles
an
looked
at
them
as
if
he
seen
a
rattlesnake
good
man
says
he
crushed
them
all
to
pieces
taste
as
good
for
all
that
says
i
for
somehow
i
in
me
head
that
he
heard
o
the
way
the
injuns
make
soup
o
the
grasshoppers
an
wos
wantin
to
try
his
hand
at
a
new
dish
he
laughed
when
i
said
this
an
told
me
he
wos
collectin
them
to
take
home
to
be
at
but
that
not
wot
i
was
goin
to

continued
joe
i
wos
goin
to
tell
ye
how
we
made
him
eat
horseflesh
he
carried
a
revolver
too
this
did
to
load
wi
shot
as
small
as
dust
an
shoot
little
birds
with
seed
him
miss

only
three
feet
away
with

an
one
day
he

of
a
suddent
an

a
big
that

but
he

the
whole
charge
right
into
martin
back
martin
was
my
comrade
name
by
good
luck
martin
had
on
a
thick
leather
coat
so
the
shot
niver
got
the
length
o
his
skin
one
day
i
noticed
that
the
had
stuffed
small
corks
into
the
muzzles
of
all
the
six
barrels
of
his
revolver
i
wondered
what
they
wos
for
but
he
wos
doin
sich
queer
things
that
i
soon
forgot
it
thought
i
jist
before
it
went
out
o
my
mind
he
thinks
that
stop
the
pistol
from
goin
off
by
accident
for
ye
must
know
he
let
it
off
three
times
the
first
day
by
accident
an
blowed
off
his
leg
the
last
time
only
the
shot
lodged
in
the
back
o
a
big
toad
he
jist
stuffed
into
his
breeches
pocket
well
soon
after
we
shot
a
buffalo
bull
so
when
it
fell
off
he
jumps
from
his
horse
an
runs
up
to
it
so
did
i
for
i
was
sure
the
beast
was
dead
an
i
had
jist
got
up
when
it
rose
rushed
at
the
o
the
way
i
yelled
for
my
rifle
was
empty
but
he
move
so
i
rushed
an
drew
the
pistol
out
o
his
belt
and
let
fly
in
the
bull
ribs
jist
as
it
ran
the
poor
man
down
martin
came
up
that
moment
an
put
a
ball
through
its
heart
an
then
we
went
to
pick
up
the
he
came
to
in
a
little
an
the
first
thing
he
said
was
my
revolver
when
i
gave
it
to
him
he
looked
at
it
an
said
with
a
solemcholy
shake
o
the
head
a
whole
lost
it
turned
out
that
he
had
taken
to
usin
the
barrels
for
bottles
to
hold
things
in
but
he
forgot
to
draw
the
charges
so
sure
enough
i
had
fired
a
charge
o
an
beetles
an
small
shot
into
the
buffalo
but
that
not
what
i
wos
goin
to
tell
ye
yit
we
corned
to
a
part
o
the
plains
where
we
wos
starved
for
want
o
game
an
the
got
so
thin
that
ye
could
see
through
him
so
i
offered
to
kill
my
horse
an
cut
it
up
for
meat
but
you
niver
saw
sich
a
face
he
made
rather
die
first
says
he
eat
it
so
we
did
kill
it
but
that
very
day
martin
got
a
shot
at
a
wild
horse
an
killed
it
the
was
down
in
the
bed
o
a
creek

the
time

martin

it
up
and

takin
care
to

hoofs
an
skin
behind
an
sot
to
work

roasted
steaks
an
marrowbones
when

fell
to
work
like
a
wolf
i
niver

a
man

into
anything
like
as
that
did
into
that
horseflesh

he

with
one
eye

martin
as
grave
as

another
sir
says
i

he
with
a
sigh
for

did
like
to

a
week
on

livin
it

then
we
fell
in
with

the
spot
wot
he
wos
standin
on
an
did
taste
meat
again
for
three
days
shortly
after
the
conclusion
of
joe
story
they
reached
the
camp
and
here
they
found
the
women
and
children
flying
about
in
a
state
of
terror
and
the
few
men
who
had
been
left
in
charge
arming
themselves
in
the
greatest
haste
hallo

cried
cameron
hastening
forward
followed
by
joe
what
has
happened
eh

dere
answered
a
trapper
pointing
down
the
valley
arm
and
mount
at
once
and
come
to
the
front
of
the
camp
cried
cameron
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
silenced
every
other
and
turned
confusion
into
order
the
cause
of
all
this
outcry
was
a
cloud
of
dust
seen
far
down
the
valley
which
was
raised
by
a
band
of
mounted
indians
who
approached
the
camp
at
full
speed
their
numbers
could
not
be
made
out
but
they
were
a
sufficiently
formidable
band
to
cause
much
anxiety
to
cameron
whose
men
at
the
time
were
scattered
to
the
various
and
only
ten
chanced
to
be
within
call
of
the
camp
however
with
these
ten
he
determined
to
show
a
bold
front
to
the
savages
whether
they
came
as
friends
or
foes
he
therefore
ordered
the
women
and
children
within
the
citadel
formed
of
the
goods
and
packs
of
furs
piled
upon
each
other
which
point
of
retreat
was
to
be
defended
to
the
last
extremity
then
galloping
to
the
front
he
collected
his
men
and
swept
down
the
valley
at
full
speed
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
near
enough
to
observe
that
the
enemy
only
numbered
four
indians
who
were
driving
a
band
of
about
a
hundred
horses
before
them
and
so
busy
were
they
in
keeping
the
troop
together
that
cameron
and
his
men
were
close
upon
them
before
they
were
observed
it
was
too
late
to
escape
joe
blunt
and
henri
had
already
swept
round
and
cut
off
their
retreat
in
this
extremity
the
indians
slipped
from
the
backs
of
their
steeds
and
darted
into
the
bushes
where
they
were
safe
from
pursuit
at
least
on
horseback
while
the
trappers
got
behind
the
horses
and
drove
them
towards
the
camp
at
this
moment
one
of
the
horses
sprang
ahead
of
the
others
and
made
for
the
mountain
with
its
mane
and
tail
flying
wildly
in
the
breeze
and
buttons
shouted
one
of
the
men
there
goes
dick
varley
horse
so
it
am
cried
henri
and
dashed
off
in
pursuit
followed
by
joe
and
two
others
why
these
are
our
own
horses
said
cameron
in
surprise
as
they
drove
them
into
a
corner
of
the
hills
from
which
they
could
not
escape
this
was
true
but
it
was
only
half
the
truth
for
besides
their
own
horses
they
had
secured
upwards
of
seventy
indian
steeds
a
most
acceptable
addition
to
their
stud
which
owing
to
casualties
and
wolves
had
been
diminishing
too
much
of
late
the
fact
was
that
the
indians
who
had
captured
the
horses
belonging
to
pierre
and
his
party
were
a
small
band
of
robbers
who
had
travelled
as
was
afterwards
learned
a
considerable
distance
from
the
south
stealing
horses
from
various
tribes
as
they
went
along
as
we
have
seen
in
an
evil
hour
they
fell
in
with
pierre
party
and
carried
off
their
steeds
which
they
drove
to
a
pass
leading
from
one
valley
to
the
other
here
they
united
them
with
the
main
band
of
their
gains
and
while
the
greater
number
of
the
robbers
descended
farther
into
the
plains
in
search
of
more
booty
four
of
them
were
sent
into
the
mountains
with
the
horses
already
procured
these
four
utterly
ignorant
of
the
presence
of
white
men
in
the
valley
drove
their
charge
as
we
have
seen
almost
into
the
camp
cameron
immediately
organized
a
party
to
go
out
in
search
of
pierre
and
his
companions
about
whose
fate
he
became
intensely
anxious
and
in
the
course
of
as
many
men
as
he
could
spare
with
safety
were
despatched
in
the
direction
of
the
blue
mountains
chapter

adventures
with
savages
and
it
is
one
thing
to
chase
a
horse
it
is
another
thing
to
catch
it
little
consideration
and
less
sagacity
are
required
to
convince
us
of
the
truth
of
that
fact
the
reader
may
perhaps
venture
to
think
this
rather
a
trifling
fact
we
are
not
so
sure
of
that
in
this
world
of
fancies
to
have
fact
incontestably
proved
and
established
is
a
comfort
and
whatever
is
a
source
of
comfort
to
mankind
is
worthy
of
notice
surely
our
reader
wo
deny
that
perhaps
he
will
so
we
can
only
console
ourself
with
the
remark
that
there
are
people
in
this
world
who
would
deny
who
would
deny
that
there
was
a
nose
on
their
face
if
you
said
there
was
well
to
return
to
the
point
which
was
the
chase
of
a
horse
in
the
abstract
from
which
we
will
rapidly
diverge
to
the
chase
of
dick
varley
horse
in
particular
this
noble
charger
having
been
ridden
by
savages
until
all
his
old
fire
and
blood
and
mettle
were
worked
up
to
a
red
heat
no
sooner
discovered
that
he
was
pursued
than
he
gave
a
snort
of
defiance
which
he
accompanied
with
a
frantic
shake
of
his
mane
and
a
fling
of
contempt
in
addition
to
a
magnificent
wave
of
his
tail
then
he
thundered
up
the
valley
at
a
pace
which
would
speedily
have
left
joe
blunt
and
henri
out
of
sight
behind
if
ay
that
the
word
what
a
word
that
is
what
a
world
of
we
live
in
there
never
was
anything
that
would
have
been
something
else
something
had
intervened
to
prevent
it
yes
we
repeat
charlie
would
have
left
his
two
friends
miles
and
miles
behind
in
what
is
called
no
time
he
had
not
run
straight
into
a
gorge
which
was
surrounded
by
inaccessible
precipices
and
out
of
which
there
was
no
exit
except
by
the
entrance
which
was
immediately
barred
by
henri
while
joe
advanced
to
catch
the
for
two
hours
at
least
did
joe
blunt
essay
to
catch
charlie
and
during
that
space
of
time
he
utterly
failed
the
horse
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
for
what
is
vulgarly
termed
a
lark
it
wo
do
henri
said
joe
advancing
towards
his
companion
and
wiping
his
forehead
with
the
cuff
of
his
leathern
coat
i
ca
catch
him
the
wind
blowed
out
o
me
body
dat
am
vexatiable
replied
henri
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
i
wos
make
try
in
that
case
i
ye
would
fail
but
go
ahead
an
do
what
ye
can
i
hold
yer
horse
so
henri
began
by
a
rush
and
a
flourish
of
legs
and
arms
that
nearly
frightened
the
horse
out
of
his
wits
for
he
went
through
all
the
complications
of
running
and
twisting
of
which
he
was
capable
without
success
when
joe
blunt
suddenly
uttered
a
stentorian
yell
that
rooted
him
to
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
to
account
for
this
we
must
explain
that
in
the
heights
of
the
rocky
mountains
vast
accumulations
of
snow
take
place
among
the
crevices
and
gorges
during
winter
such
of
these
masses
as
form
on
steep
slopes
are
loosened
by
occasional
thaws
and
are
precipitated
in
the
form
of
avalanches
into
the
valleys
below
carrying
trees
and
stones
along
with
them
in
their
thundering
descent
in
the
gloomy
gorge
where
dick
horse
had
taken
refuge
the
precipices
were
so
steep
that
many
avalanches
had
occurred
as
was
evident
from
the
mounds
of
heaped
snow
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
most
of
them
neither
stones
nor
trees
were
carried
down
here
however
for
the
cliffs
were
nearly
perpendicular
and
the
snow
slipping
over
their
edges
had
fallen
on
the
grass
below
such
an
avalanche
was
now
about
to
take
place
and
it
was
this
that
caused
joe
to
utter
his
cry
of
alarm
and
warning
henri
and
the
horse
were
directly
under
the
cliff
over
which
it
was
about
to
be
hurled
the
latter
close
to
the
wall
of
rock
the
other
at
some
distance
away
from
it
joe
cried
again
back
henri
back
when
the
mass
and
fell
with
a
roar
like
prolonged
thunder
henri
sprang
back
in
time
to
save
his
life
though
he
was
knocked
down
and
almost
stunned
but
poor
charlie
was
completely
buried
under
the
avalanche
which
now
presented
the
appearance
of
a
of
snow
the
instant
henri
recovered
sufficiently
joe
and
he
mounted
their
horses
and
galloped
back
to
the
camp
as
fast
as
possible
meanwhile
another
spectator
stepped
forward
upon
the
scene
they
had
left
and
surveyed
the
snow
hill
with
a
critical
eye
this
was
no
less
than
a
grizzly
bear
which
had
unobserved
been
a
spectator
and
which
immediately
proceeded
to
dig
into
the
mound
with
the
purpose
no
doubt
of
disentombing
the
carcass
of
the
horse
for
purposes
of
his
own
while
he
was
thus
actively
engaged
the
two
hunters
reached
the
camp
where
they
found
that
pierre
and
his
party
had
just
arrived
the
men
sent
out
in
search
of
them
had
scarcely
advanced
a
mile
when
they
found
them
trudging
back
to
the
camp
in
a
very
disconsolate
manner
but
all
their
sorrows
were
put
to
flight
on
hearing
of
the
curious
way
in
which
the
horses
had
been
returned
to
them
with
interest
scarcely
had
dick
varley
however
congratulated
himself
on
the
recovery
of
his
gallant
steed
when
he
was
thrown
into
despair
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
joe
with
the
tidings
of
the
catastrophe
we
have
just
related
of
course
there
was
a
general
rush
to
the
rescue
only
a
few
men
were
ordered
to
remain
to
guard
the
camp
while
the
remainder
mounted
their
horses
and
galloped
towards
the
gorge
where
charlie
had
been
entombed
on
arriving
they
found
that
bruin
had
worked
with
such
laudable
zeal
that
nothing
but
the
tip
of
his
tail
was
seen
sticking
out
of
the
hole
which
he
had
dug
the
hunters
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
as
they
sprang
to
the
ground
and
standing
in
a
semicircle
in
front
of
the
hole
prepared
to
fire
but
crusoe
resolved
to
have
the
honour
of
leading
the
assault
he
seized
fast
hold
of
bruin
flank
and
caused
his
teeth
to
meet
therein
caleb
backed
out
at
once
and
turned
round
but
before
he
could
recover
from
his
surprise
a
dozen
bullets
pierced
his
heart
and
brain
now
lads
cried
cameron
setting
to
work
with
a
large
wooden
shovel
work
like
niggers
if
there
any
life
left
in
the
horse
it
soon
be
smothered
out
unless
we
set
him
free
the
men
needed
no
urging
however
they
worked
as
if
their
lives
depended
on
their
exertions
dick
varley
in
particular
laboured
like
a
young
hercules
and
henri
hurled
masses
of
snow
about
in
a
most
surprising
manner
crusoe
too
entered
heartily
into
the
spirit
of
the
work
and
scraping
with
his
forepaws
sent
such
a
continuous
shower
of
snow
behind
him
that
he
was
speedily
lost
to
view
in
a
hole
of
his
own
excavating
in
the
course
of
a
cavern
was
dug
in
the
mound
almost
close
up
to
the
cliff
and
the
men
were
beginning
to
look
about
for
the
crushed
body
of
dick
steed
when
an
exclamation
from
henri
attracted
their
attention
ha
mes
ami
here
am
be
one
hole
the
truth
of
this
could
not
be
doubted
for
the
eccentric
trapper
had
thrust
his
shovel
through
the
wall
of
snow
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
cavern
beyond
and
immediately
followed
up
his
remark
by
thrusting
in
his
head
and
shoulders
he
drew
them
out
in
a
few
seconds
with
a
look
of
intense
amazement
voilà
joe
blunt
look
in
dere
and
you
shall
see
fat
you
vill
behold
why
it
the
horse
i
do
cried
joe
go
ahead
lads
so
saying
he
resumed
his
shovelling
vigorously
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
hole
was
opened
up
sufficiently
to
enable
a
man
to
enter
dick
sprang
in
and
there
stood
charlie
close
beside
the
cliff
looking
as
sedate
and
unconcerned
as
if
all
that
had
been
going
on
had
no
reference
to
him
whatever
the
cause
of
his
safety
was
simple
enough
the
precipice
beside
which
he
stood
when
the
avalanche
occurred
overhung
its
base
at
that
point
considerably
so
that
when
the
snow
descended
a
clear
space
of
several
feet
wide
was
left
all
along
its
base
here
charlie
had
remained
in
perfect
comfort
until
his
friends
dug
him
out
congratulating
themselves
not
a
little
on
having
saved
the
charger
and
bagged
a
grizzly
bear
the
trappers
remounted
and
returned
to
the
camp
for
some
time
after
this
nothing
worthy
of
particular
note
occurred
the
trapping
operations
went
on
prosperously
and
without
interruption
from
the
indians
who
seemed
to
have
left
the
locality
altogether
during
this
period
dick
and
crusoe
and
charlie
had
many
excursions
together
and
the
silver
rifle
full
many
a
time
sent
death
to
the
heart
of
bear
and
elk
and
buffalo
while
indirectly
it
sent
joy
to
the
heart
of
man
woman
and
child
in
camp
in
the
shape
of
juicy
steaks
and
joe
and
henri
devoted
themselves
almost
exclusively
to
trapping
beaver
in
which
pursuit
they
were
so
successful
that
they
speedily
became
wealthy
men
according
to
backwood
notions
of
wealth
with
the
beaver
that
they
caught
they
purchased
from
cameron
store
powder
and
shot
enough
for
a
long
hunting
expedition
and
a
couple
of
spare
horses
to
carry
their
packs
they
also
purchased
a
large
assortment
of
such
goods
and
trinkets
as
would
prove
acceptable
to
indians
and
supplied
themselves
with
new
blankets
and
a
few
pairs
of
strong
moccasins
of
which
they
stood
much
in
need
thus
they
went
on
from
day
to
day
until
symptoms
of
the
approach
of
winter
warned
them
that
it
was
time
to
return
to
the
mustang
valley
about
this
time
an
event
occurred
which
totally
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
in
these
remote
valleys
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
precipitated
the
departure
of
our
four
friends
dick
joe
henri
and
crusoe
this
was
the
sudden
arrival
of
a
whole
tribe
of
indians
as
their
advent
was
somewhat
remarkable
we
shall
devote
to
it
the
commencement
of
a
new
chapter

an

indians
and
their
doings
the
stampede
charlie
one
day
dick
varley
was
out
on
a
solitary
hunting
expedition
near
the
rocky
gorge
where
his
horse
had
received
temporary
burial
a
week
or
two
before
crusoe
was
with
him
of
course
dick
had
tied
charlie
to
a
tree
and
was
sunning
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
from
the
top
of
which
he
had
a
fine
view
of
the
valley
and
the
rugged
precipices
that
hemmed
it
in
just
in
front
of
the
spot
on
which
he
sat
the
precipices
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gorge
rose
to
a
considerable
height
above
him
so
that
their
ragged
outlines
were
drawn
sharply
across
the
clear
sky
dick
was
gazing
in
dreamy
silence
at
the
jutting
rocks
and
dark
caverns
and
speculating
on
the
probable
number
of
bears
that
dwelt
there
when
a
slight
degree
of
restlessness
on
the
part
of
crusoe
attracted
him
what
pup
said
he
laying
his
hand
on
the
dog
broad
back
crusoe
looked
the
answer
i
do
know
dick
but
it
you
may
depend
upon
it
else
i
would
not
have
disturbed
you
dick
lifted
his
rifle
from
the
ground
and
laid
it
in
the
hollow
of
his
left
arm
there
must
be
something
in
the
wind
remarked
dick
as
wind
is
known
to
be
composed
of
two
distinct
gases
crusoe
felt
perfectly
safe
in
replying
yes
with
his
tail
immediately
after
he
added
hallo
did
you
hear
that
with
his
ears
dick
did
hear
it
and
sprang
hastily
to
his
feet
as
a
sound
like
yet
unlike
distant
thunder
came
faintly
down
upon
the
breeze
in
a
few
seconds
the
sound
increased
to
a
roar
in
which
was
mingled
the
wild
cries
of
men
neither
dick
nor
crusoe
moved
for
the
sounds
came
from
behind
the
heights
in
front
of
them
and
they
felt
that
the
only
way
to
solve
the
question
what
can
the
sounds
be
was
to
wait
till
the
sounds
should
solve
it
themselves
suddenly
the
muffled
sounds
gave
place
to
the
distinct
bellowing
of
cattle
the
clatter
of
innumerable
hoofs
and
the
yells
of
savage
men
while
at
the
same
moment
the
edges
of
the
opposite
cliffs
became
alive
with
indians
and
buffaloes
rushing
about
in
frantic
haste
the
former
almost
mad
with
savage
excitement
the
latter
with
blind
rage
and
terror
on
reaching
the
edge
of
the
dizzy
precipice
the
buffaloes
turned
abruptly
and
tossed
their
ponderous
heads
as
they
coursed
along
the
edge
yet
a
few
of
them
unable
to
check
their
headlong
course
fell
over
and
were
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
below
such
falls
dick
observed
were
hailed
with
shouts
of
delight
by
the
indians
whose
sole
object
evidently
was
to
enjoy
the
sport
of
driving
the
terrified
animals
over
the
precipice
the
wily
savages
had
chosen
their
ground
well
for
this
purpose
the
cliff
immediately
opposite
to
dick
varley
was
a
huge
projection
from
the
precipice
that
hemmed
in
the
gorge
a
species
of
cape
or
promontory
several
hundred
yards
wide
at
the
base
and
narrowing
abruptly
to
a
point
the
sides
of
this
projection
were
quite
perpendicular
indeed
in
some
places
the
top
overhung
the
base
and
they
were
at
least
three
hundred
feet
high
broken
and
jagged
rocks
of
that
peculiarly
chaotic
character
which
probably
suggested
the
name
to
this
part
of
the
great
american
chain
projected
from
and
were
scattered
all
round
the
cliffs
over
these
the
indians
whose
numbers
increased
every
moment
strove
to
drive
the
luckless
herd
of
buffaloes
that
had
chanced
to
fall
in
their
way
the
task
was
easy
the
unsuspecting
animals
of
which
there
were
hundreds
rushed
in
a
dense
mass
upon
the
cape
referred
to
on
they
came
with
irresistible
impetuosity
bellowing
furiously
while
their
hoofs
thundered
on
the
turf
with
the
muffled
continuous
roar
of
a
distant
but
mighty
cataract
the
indians
meanwhile
urging
them
on
by
hideous
yells
and
frantic
gestures
the
came
bounding
madly
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
here
they
stopped
short
and
gazed
affrighted
at
the
gulf
below
it
was
but
for
a
moment
the
irresistible
momentum
of
the
flying
mass
behind
pushed
them
over
down
they
came
absolutely
a
living
cataract
upon
the
rocks
below
some
struck
on
the
projecting
rocks
in
the
descent
and
their
bodies
were
dashed
almost
in
pieces
while
their
blood
spurted
out
in
showers
others
leaped
from
rock
to
rock
with
awful
bounds
until
losing
their
foothold
they
fell
headlong
while
others
descended
sheer
down
into
the
sweltering
mass
that
lay
shattered
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
dick
varley
and
his
dog
remained
rooted
to
the
rock
as
they
gazed
at
the
sickening
sight
as
if
petrified
scarce
fifty
of
that
noble
herd
of
buffaloes
escaped
the
awful
leap
but
they
escaped
only
to
fall
before
the
arrows
of
their
ruthless
pursuers
dick
had
often
heard
of
this
tendency
of
the
indians
where
buffaloes
were
very
numerous
to
drive
them
over
precipices
in
mere
wanton
sport
and
cruelty
but
he
had
never
seen
it
until
now
and
the
sight
filled
his
soul
with
horror
it
was
not
until
the
din
and
tumult
of
the
perishing
herd
and
the
shrill
yells
of
the
indians
had
almost
died
away
that
he
turned
to
quit
the
spot
but
the
instant
he
did
so
another
shout
was
raised
the
savages
had
observed
him
and
were
seen
galloping
along
the
cliffs
towards
the
head
of
the
gorge
with
the
obvious
intention
of
gaining
the
other
side
and
capturing
him
dick
sprang
on
charlie
back
and
the
next
instant
was
flying
down
the
valley
towards
the
camp
he
did
not
however
fear
being
overtaken
for
the
gorge
could
not
be
crossed
and
the
way
round
the
head
of
it
was
long
and
rugged
but
he
was
anxious
to
alarm
the
camp
as
quickly
as
possible
so
that
they
might
have
time
to
call
in
the
more
distant
trappers
and
make
preparations
for
defence
where
away
now
youngster
inquired
cameron
emerging
from
his
tent
as
dick
taking
the
brook
that
flowed
in
front
at
a
flying
leap
came
crashing
through
the
bushes
into
the
midst
of
the
at
full
speed
injuns
ejaculated
dick
reining
up
and
vaulting
out
of
the
saddle
hundreds
of
fiends
incarnate
every
one
are
they
near
yes
an
hour
bring
them
down
on
us
are
joe
and
henri
far
from
camp
at
creek
replied
cameron
with
an
expression
of
bitterness
as
he
caught
up
his
gun
and
shouted
to
several
men
who
hurried
up
on
seeing
our
hero
burst
into
camp
creek
muttered
dick
i
bring
in
though
he
continued
glancing
at
several
of
the
camp
horses
that
grazed
close
at
hand
in
another
moment
he
was
on
charlie
back
the
line
of
one
of
the
best
horses
was
in
his
hand
and
almost
before
cameron
knew
what
he
was
about
he
was
flying
down
the
valley
like
the
wind
charlie
often
stretched
out
at
full
speed
to
please
his
young
master
but
seldom
had
he
been
urged
forward
as
he
was
upon
this
occasion
the
led
horse
being
light
and
wild
kept
well
up
and
in
a
marvellously
short
space
of
time
they
were
at
creek
hallo
dick
wot
to
do
inquired
joe
blunt
who
was
up
to
his
knees
in
the
water
setting
a
trap
at
the
moment
his
friend
galloped
up
injuns
where
henri
demanded
dick
at
the
head
o
the
dam
there
dick
was
off
in
a
moment
and
almost
instantly
returned
with
henri
galloping
beside
him
no
word
was
spoken
in
time
of
action
these
men
did
not
waste
words
during
dick
momentary
absence
joe
blunt
had
caught
up
his
rifle
and
examined
the
priming
so
that
when
dick
pulled
up
beside
him
he
merely
laid
his
hand
on
the
saddle
saying
all
right
as
he
vaulted
on
charlie
back
behind
his
young
companion
in
another
moment
they
were
away
at
full
speed
the
mustang
seemed
to
feel
that
unwonted
exertions
were
required
of
him
double
weighted
though
he
was
he
kept
well
up
with
the
other
horse
and
in
less
than
two
hours
after
dick
leaving
the
camp
the
three
hunters
came
in
sight
of
it
meanwhile
cameron
had
collected
nearly
all
his
forces
and
put
his
camp
in
a
state
of
defence
before
the
indians
arrived
which
they
did
suddenly
and
as
usual
at
full
gallop
to
the
amount
of
at
least
two
hundred
they
did
not
at
first
seem
disposed
to
hold
friendly
intercourse
with
the
trappers
but
assembled
in
a
semicircle
round
the
camp
in
a
menacing
attitude
while
one
of
their
chiefs
stepped
forward
to
hold
a
palaver
for
some
time
the
conversation
on
both
sides
was
polite
enough
but
by
degrees
the
indian
chief
assumed
an
imperious
tone
and
demanded
gifts
from
the
trappers
taking
care
to
enforce
his
request
by
hinting
that
thousands
of
his
countrymen
were
not
far
distant
cameron
stoutly
refused
and
the
palaver
threatened
to
come
to
an
abrupt
and
unpleasant
termination
just
at
the
time
that
dick
and
his
friends
appeared
on
the
scene
of
action
the
brook
was
cleared
at
a
bound
the
three
hunters
leaped
from
their
steeds
and
sprang
to
the
front
with
a
degree
of
energy
that
had
a
visible
effect
on
the
savages
and
cameron
seizing
the
moment
proposed
that
the
two
parties
should
smoke
a
pipe
and
hold
a
council
the
indians
agreed
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
engaged
in
animated
and
friendly
intercourse
the
speeches
were
long
and
the
compliments
paid
on
either
side
were
inflated
and
we
fear
undeserved
but
the
result
of
the
interview
was
that
cameron
made
the
indians
a
present
of
tobacco
and
a
few
trinkets
and
sent
them
back
to
their
friends
to
tell
them
that
he
was
willing
to
trade
with
them
next
day
the
whole
tribe
arrived
in
the
valley
and
pitched
their
deerskin
tents
on
the
plain
opposite
to
the
camp
of
the
white
men
their
numbers
far
exceeded
cameron
expectation
and
it
was
with
some
anxiety
that
he
proceeded
to
strengthen
his
fortifications
as
much
as
circumstances
and
the
nature
of
the
ground
would
admit
the
indian
camp
which
numbered
upwards
of
a
thousand
souls
was
arranged
with
great
regularity
and
was
divided
into
three
distinct
sections
each
section
being
composed
of
a
separate
tribe
the
great
snake
nation
at
that
time
embraced
three
tribes
or
divisions
namely
the
or
the
or
and
the
banattees
or
robbers
these
were
the
most
numerous
and
powerful
indians
on
the
west
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
dwelt
in
the
plains
and
hunted
the
buffaloes
dressed
well
were
cleanly
rich
in
horses
bold
independent
and
good
warriors
the
lived
chiefly
by
fishing
and
were
found
on
the
banks
of
the
rivers
and
lakes
throughout
the
country
they
were
more
corpulent
slovenly
and
indolent
than
the
and
more
peaceful
the
banattees
as
we
have
before
mentioned
were
the
robbers
of
the
mountains
they
were
a
wild
and
contemptible
race
and
at
enmity
with
every
one
in
summer
they
went
about
nearly
naked
in
winter
they
clothed
themselves
in
the
skins
of
rabbits
and
wolves
being
excellent
mimics
they
could
imitate
the
howling
of
wolves
the
neighing
of
horses
and
the
cries
of
birds
by
which
means
they
could
approach
travellers
rob
them
and
then
fly
to
their
rocky
fastnesses
in
the
mountains
where
pursuit
was
vain
such
were
the
men
who
now
assembled
in
front
of
the
camp
of
the
and
cameron
soon
found
that
the
news
of
his
presence
in
the
country
had
spread
far
and
wide
among
the
natives
bringing
them
to
the
neighbourhood
of
his
camp
in
immense
crowds
so
that
during
the
next
few
days
their
numbers
increased
to
thousands
several
long
palavers
quickly
ensued
between
the
red
men
and
the
white
and
the
two
great
chiefs
who
seemed
to
hold
despotic
rule
over
the
assembled
tribes
were
extremely
favourable
to
the
idea
of
universal
peace
which
was
propounded
to
them
in
several
set
speeches
of
great
length
and
very
considerable
power
these
natural
orators
explained
their
willingness
to
enter
into
amicable
relations
with
all
the
surrounding
nations
as
well
as
with
the
white
men
but
said
the
chief
of
the
a
man
above
six
feet
high
and
of
immense
muscular
strength
but
my
tribe
can
not
answer
for
the
banattees
who
are
robbers
and
can
not
be
punished
because
they
dwell
in
scattered
families
among
the
mountains
the
banattees
are
bad
they
can
not
be
trusted
none
of
the
banattees
were
present
at
the
council
when
this
was
said
and
if
they
had
been
it
would
have
mattered
little
for
they
were
neither
fierce
nor
courageous
although
bold
enough
in
their
own
haunts
to
murder
and
rob
the
unwary
the
second
chief
did
not
quite
agree
with
he
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
make
peace
with
their
natural
enemies
the
peigans
and
the
blackfeet
on
the
east
side
of
the
mountains
it
was
very
desirable
he
admitted
but
neither
of
these
tribes
would
consent
to
it
he
felt
sure
upon
this
joe
blunt
rose
and
said
the
great
chief
of
the
is
wise
and
knows
that
enemies
can
not
be
reconciled
unless
deputies
are
sent
to
make
proposals
of
peace
the
does
not
know
the
blackfeet
answered
the
chief
who
will
go
into
the
lands
of
the
blackfeet
my
young
men
have
been
sent
once
and
again
and
their
scalps
are
now
fringes
to
the
leggings
of
their
enemies
the
do
not
cross
the
mountains
but
for
the
purpose
of
making
war
the
chief
speaks
truth
returned
joe
yet
there
are
three
men
round
the
council
fire
who
will
go
to
the
blackfeet
and
the
peigans
with
messages
of
peace
from
the
snakes
if
they
wish
it
joe
pointed
to
himself
henri
and
dick
as
he
spoke
and
added
we
three
do
not
belong
to
the
camp
of
the
we
only
lodge
with
them
for
a
time
the
great
chief
of
the
white
men
has
sent
us
to
make
peace
with
the
and
to
tell
them
that
he
desires
to
trade
with
them
to
exchange
hatchets
and
guns
and
blankets
for
furs
this
declaration
interested
the
two
chiefs
greatly
and
after
a
good
deal
of
discussion
they
agreed
to
take
advantage
of
joe
blunt
offer
and
appoint
him
as
a
deputy
to
the
court
of
their
enemies
having
arranged
these
matters
to
their
satisfaction
cameron
bestowed
a
red
flag
and
a
blue
surtout
with
brass
buttons
on
each
of
the
chiefs
and
a
variety
of
smaller
articles
on
the
other
members
of
the
council
and
sent
them
away
in
a
particularly
amiable
frame
of
mind
burst
the
blue
surtout
at
the
shoulders
and
elbows
in
putting
it
on
as
it
was
much
too
small
for
his
gigantic
frame
but
never
having
seen
such
an
article
of
apparel
before
he
either
regarded
this
as
the
natural
and
proper
consequence
of
putting
it
on
or
was
totally
indifferent
to
it
for
he
merely
looked
at
the
rents
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
while
his
squaw
surreptitiously
cut
off
the
two
back
buttons
and
thrust
them
into
her
bosom
by
the
time
the
council
closed
the
night
was
far
advanced
and
a
bright
moon
was
shedding
a
flood
of
soft
light
over
the
picturesque
and
busy
scene
i
go
to
the
injun
camp
said
joe
to
walter
cameron
as
the
chiefs
rose
to
depart
the
season
far
enough
advanced
already
it
time
to
be
off
and
if
i
to
speak
for
the
redskins
in
the
blackfeet
council
i
need
to
know
what
to
say
please
yourself
master
blunt
answered
cameron
i
like
your
company
and
that
of
your
friends
and
if
it
suited
you
i
would
be
glad
to
take
you
along
with
us
to
the
coast
of
the
pacific
but
your
mission
among
the
indians
is
a
good
one
and
i
help
it
on
all
i
i
suppose
you
will
go
also
he
added
turning
to
dick
varley
who
was
still
seated
beside
the
council
fire
caressing
crusoe
wherever
joe
goes
i
go
answered
dick
crusoe
tail
ears
and
eyes
demonstrated
high
approval
of
the
sentiment
involved
in
this
speech
and
your
friend
henri
he
goes
too
answered
joe
it
as
well
that
the
redskins
should
see
the
three
o
us
before
we
start
for
the
east
side
o
the
ho
henri
come
here
lad
henri
obeyed
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
three
friends
crossed
the
brook
to
the
indian
camp
and
were
guided
to
the
principal
lodge
by
here
a
great
council
was
held
and
the
proposed
attempt
at
negotiations
for
peace
with
their
ancient
enemies
fully
discussed
while
they
were
thus
engaged
and
just
as
had
in
the
energy
of
an
enthusiastic
peroration
burst
the
blue
surtout
up
to
the
collar
a
distant
rushing
sound
was
heard
which
caused
every
man
to
spring
to
his
feet
run
out
of
the
tent
and
seize
his
weapons
what
can
it
be
joe
whispered
dick
as
they
stood
at
the
tent
door
leaning
on
their
rifles
and
listening
intently
answered
joe
shortly
most
of
the
numerous
fires
of
the
camp
had
gone
out
but
the
bright
moon
revealed
the
dusky
forms
of
thousands
of
indians
whom
the
unwonted
sound
had
startled
moving
rapidly
about
the
mystery
was
soon
explained
the
indian
camp
was
pitched
on
an
open
plain
of
several
miles
in
extent
which
took
a
sudden
bend
distant
where
a
spur
of
the
mountains
shut
out
the
farther
end
of
the
valley
from
view
from
beyond
this
point
the
dull
rumbling
sound
proceeded
suddenly
there
was
a
roar
as
if
a
mighty
cataract
had
been
let
loose
upon
the
scene
at
the
same
moment
a
countless
herd
of
wild
horses
came
thundering
round
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
swept
over
the
plain
straight
towards
the
indian
camp
a
stampede
cried
joe
springing
to
the
assistance
of
whose
favourite
horses
were
picketed
near
the
tent
on
they
came
like
a
living
torrent
and
the
thunder
of
a
thousand
hoofs
was
soon
mingled
with
the
howling
of
hundreds
of
dogs
in
the
camp
and
the
yelling
of
indians
as
they
vainly
endeavoured
to
restrain
the
rising
excitement
of
their
steeds
henri
and
dick
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
gazing
in
silent
wonder
at
the
fierce
and
uncontrollable
gallop
of
the
thousands
of
horses
that
bore
down
upon
the
camp
with
the
tumultuous
violence
of
a
mighty
cataract
as
the
maddened
troop
drew
nigh
the
camp
horses
began
to
snort
and
tremble
violently
and
when
the
rush
of
the
wild
steeds
was
almost
upon
them
they
became
ungovernable
with
terror
broke
their
halters
and
hobbles
and
dashed
wildly
about
to
add
to
the
confusion
at
that
moment
a
cloud
passed
over
the
moon
and
threw
the
whole
scene
into
deep
obscurity
blind
with
terror
which
was
probably
increased
by
the
din
of
their
own
mad
flight
the
galloping
troop
came
on
and
with
a
sound
like
the
continuous
roar
of
thunder
that
for
an
instant
drowned
the
yell
of
dog
and
man
they
burst
upon
the
camp
trampling
over
packs
and
skins
and
dried
meat
in
their
headlong
speed
and
overturning
several
of
the
smaller
tents
in
another
moment
they
swept
out
upon
the
plain
beyond
and
were
soon
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
while
the
yelping
of
dogs
as
they
vainly
pursued
them
mingled
and
gradually
died
away
with
the
distant
thunder
of
their
retreat
this
was
a
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
scenes
that
can
be
witnessed
in
the
western
wilderness
lend
a
hand
henri
shouted
joe
who
was
struggling
with
a
powerful
horse
wot
comed
over
yer
brains
man
this
brute
git
off
if
you
do
look
sharp
dick
and
henri
both
answered
to
the
summons
and
they
succeeded
in
throwing
the
struggling
animal
on
its
side
and
holding
it
down
until
its
excitement
was
somewhat
abated
had
also
been
successful
in
securing
his
favourite
hunter
but
nearly
every
other
horse
belonging
to
the
camp
had
broken
loose
and
joined
the
whirlwind
gallop
but
they
gradually
dropped
out
and
before
morning
the
most
of
them
were
secured
by
their
owners
as
there
were
at
least
two
thousand
horses
and
an
equal
number
of
dogs
in
the
part
of
the
indian
camp
which
had
been
thus
overrun
by
the
wild
mustangs
the
turmoil
as
may
be
imagined
was
prodigious
yet
strange
to
say
no
accident
of
a
serious
nature
occurred
beyond
the
loss
of
several
chargers
in
the
midst
of
this
exciting
scene
there
was
one
heart
which
beat
with
a
nervous
vehemence
that
burst
it
this
was
the
heart
of
dick
varley
horse
charlie
well
known
to
him
was
that
distant
rumbling
sound
that
floated
on
the
night
air
into
the
camp
where
he
was
picketed
close
to
cameron
tent
many
a
time
had
he
heard
the
approach
of
such
a
wild
troop
and
often
in
days
not
long
gone
by
had
his
shrill
neigh
rung
out
as
he
joined
and
led
the
band
he
was
first
to
hear
the
sound
and
by
his
restive
actions
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
to
it
as
a
precautionary
measure
they
all
sprang
up
and
stood
by
their
horses
to
soothe
them
but
as
a
brook
with
a
belt
of
bushes
and
quarter
of
a
mile
of
plain
intervened
between
their
camp
and
the
mustangs
as
they
flew
past
they
had
little
or
no
trouble
in
restraining
them
not
so
however
with
charlie
at
the
very
moment
that
his
master
was
congratulating
himself
on
the
supposed
security
of
his
position
he
wrenched
the
halter
from
the
hand
of
him
who
held
it
burst
through
the
barrier
of
felled
trees
that
had
been
thrown
round
the
camp
cleared
the
brook
at
a
bound
and
with
a
wild
hilarious
neigh
resumed
his
old
place
in
the
ranks
of
the
mustangs
of
the
prairie
little
did
dick
think
when
the
flood
of
horses
swept
past
him
that
his
own
good
steed
was
there
rejoicing
in
his
recovered
liberty
but
crusoe
knew
it
ay
the
wind
had
borne
down
the
information
to
his
acute
nose
before
the
living
storm
burst
upon
the
camp
and
when
charlie
rushed
past
with
the
long
tough
halter
trailing
at
his
heels
crusoe
sprang
to
his
side
seized
the
end
of
the
halter
with
his
teeth
and
galloped
off
along
with
him
it
was
a
long
gallop
and
a
tough
one
but
crusoe
held
on
for
it
was
a
settled
principle
in
his
mind
to
give
in
at
first
the
check
upon
charlie
speed
was
imperceptible
but
by
degrees
the
weight
of
the
gigantic
dog
began
to
tell
and
after
a
time
they
fell
a
little
to
the
rear
then
by
good
fortune
the
troop
passed
through
a
mass
of
underwood
and
the
line
getting
entangled
brought
their
mad
career
forcibly
to
a
close
the
mustangs
passed
on
and
the
two
friends
were
left
to
keep
each
other
company
in
the
dark
how
long
they
would
have
remained
thus
is
uncertain
for
neither
of
them
had
sagacity
enough
to
undo
a
complicated
entanglement
fortunately
however
in
his
energetic
tugs
at
the
line
sharp
teeth
partially
severed
it
and
a
sudden
start
on
the
part
of
charlie
caused
it
to
part
before
he
could
escape
crusoe
again
seized
the
end
of
it
and
led
him
slowly
but
steadily
back
to
the
indian
camp
never
halting
or
turning
aside
until
he
had
placed
the
line
in
dick
varley
hand
hallo
pup
where
have
ye
bin
how
did
ye
bring
him
here
exclaimed
dick
as
he
gazed
in
amazement
at
his
horse
crusoe
wagged
his
tail
as
if
to
say
be
thankful
that
you
got
him
dick
my
boy
and
do
ask
questions
that
you
know
i
answer
he
must
ha
broke
loose
and
jined
the
stampede
remarked
joe
coming
out
of
the
chief
tent
at
the
moment
but
tie
him
up
dick
and
come
in
for
we
want
to
settle
about
startin
or
nixt
day
having
fastened
charlie
to
a
stake
and
ordered
crusoe
to
watch
him
dick
the
tent
where
the
council
had
reassembled
and
where
having
in
the
recent
struggle
split
the
blue
surtout
completely
up
to
the
collar
so
that
his
backbone
was
visible
throughout
the
greater
part
of
its
length
was
holding
forth
in
eloquent
strains
on
the
subject
of
peace
in
general
and
peace
with
the
blackfeet
the
ancient
enemies
of
the
in
particular
chapter
xxiv
and
prospects
dick
becomes
and
henri
metaphysical
indians
attack
the
camp
a
on
the
following
day
the
indians
gave
themselves
up
to
unlimited
feasting
in
consequence
of
the
arrival
of
a
large
body
of
hunters
with
an
immense
supply
of
buffalo
meat
it
was
a
regular
day
of
rejoicing
upwards
of
six
hundred
buffaloes
had
been
killed
and
as
the
supply
of
meat
before
their
arrival
had
been
ample
the
camp
was
now
overflowing
with
plenty
feasts
were
given
by
the
chiefs
and
the
medicine
men
went
about
the
camp
uttering
loud
cries
which
were
meant
to
express
gratitude
to
the
great
spirit
for
the
bountiful
supply
of
food
they
also
carried
a
portion
of
meat
to
the
aged
and
infirm
who
were
unable
to
hunt
for
themselves
and
had
no
young
men
in
their
family
circle
to
hunt
for
them
this
arrival
of
the
hunters
was
a
fortunate
circumstance
as
it
put
the
indians
in
great
and
inclined
them
to
hold
friendly
intercourse
with
the
trappers
who
for
some
time
continued
to
drive
a
brisk
trade
in
furs
having
no
market
for
the
disposal
of
their
furs
the
indians
of
course
had
more
than
they
knew
what
to
do
with
and
were
therefore
glad
to
exchange
those
of
the
most
beautiful
and
valuable
kind
for
a
mere
trifle
so
that
the
trappers
laid
aside
their
traps
for
a
time
and
devoted
themselves
to
traffic
meanwhile
joe
blunt
and
his
friends
made
preparations
for
their
return
journey
ye
see
remarked
joe
to
henri
and
dick
as
they
sat
beside
the
fire
in
lodge
and
feasted
on
a
potful
of
grasshopper
soup
which
the
great
chief
squaw
had
just
placed
before
them
ye
see
my
is
as

and

it

the
mustang
valley

interrupted
dick
remitting
for
a
few
seconds
the
use
of
his
teeth
in
order
to
exercise
his
tongue
ha
joe
but
it
do
like
what
give
up
a
hunter
life
and
become
a
farmer
i
should
think
not
bon
ejaculated
henri
but
whether
the
remark
had
reference
to
the
grasshopper
soup
or
the
sentiment
we
can
not
tell
well
continued
joe
commencing
to
devour
a
large
buffalo
steak
with
a
hunter
appetite
ye
please
yourselves
lads
as
to
that
but
as
i
wos
sayin
we
got
a
powerful
lot
o
furs
an
a
big

and
i
answer

two
o
us
followin
ye
eh
wo
we
crusoe

remarked
the
dog
quietly
how
comes
it
inquired
dick
that
these
indians
do
care
for
our
tobacco
they
like
their
own
better
i
answered
joe
most
all
the
western
injuns
do
they
make
it
o
the
dried
leaves
o
the
shumack
and
the
inner
bark
o
the
chopped
very
small
an
mixed
together
they
call
this
stuff
but
they
like
to
mix
about
a
fourth
o
our
tobacco
with
it
so
tells
me
he
a
good
judge
the
amount
that
mortal
smokes
oncommon
what
are
they
doin
yonder
inquired
dick
pointing
to
a
group
of
men
who
had
been
feasting
for
some
time
past
in
front
of
a
tent
within
sight
of
our
trio
goin
to
sing
i
think
replied
joe
as
he
spoke
six
young
warriors
were
seen
to
work
their
bodies
about
in
a
very
remarkable
way
and
give
utterance
to
still
more
remarkable
sounds
which
gradually
increased
until
the
singers
burst
out
into
that
terrific
yell
or
for
which
american
savages
have
long
been
famous
its
effect
would
have
been
appalling
to
unaccustomed
ears
then
they
allowed
their
voices
to
die
away
in
soft
plaintive
tones
while
their
action
corresponded
thereto
suddenly
the
furious
style
was
revived
and
the
men
wrought
themselves
into
a
condition
little
short
of
madness
while
their
yells
rang
wildly
through
the
camp
this
was
too
much
for
ordinary
canine
nature
to
withstand
so
all
the
dogs
in
the
neighbourhood
joined
in
the
horrible
chorus
crusoe
had
long
since
learned
to
treat
the
eccentricities
of
indians
and
their
curs
with
dignified
contempt
he
paid
no
attention
to
this
serenade
but
lay
sleeping
by
the
fire
until
dick
and
his
companions
rose
to
take
leave
of
their
host
and
return
to
the
camp
of
the
the
remainder
of
that
night
was
spent
in
making
preparations
for
setting
forth
on
the
morrow
and
when
at
gray
dawn
dick
and
crusoe
lay
down
to
snatch
a
few
hours
repose
the
yells
and
howling
in
the
snake
camp
were
going
on
as
vigorously
as
ever
the
sun
had
arisen
and
his
beams
were
just
tipping
the
summits
of
the
rocky
mountains
causing
the
snowy
peaks
to
glitter
like
flame
and
the
deep
ravines
and
gorges
to
look
sombre
and
mysterious
by
contrast
when
dick
and
joe
and
henri
mounted
their
gallant
steeds
and
with
crusoe
gambolling
before
and
the
two
trotting
by
their
side
turned
their
faces
eastward
and
bade
adieu
to
the
indian
camp
crusoe
was
in
great
spirits
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
he
and
his
companions
were
on
their
way
home
and
testified
his
satisfaction
by
bursts
of
scampering
over
the
hills
and
valleys
doubtless
he
thought
of
dick
varley
cottage
and
of
dick
mild
mother
undoubtedly
too
he
thought
of
his
own
mother
fan
and
felt
a
glow
of
filial
affection
as
he
did
so
of
this
we
feel
quite
certain
he
would
have
been
unworthy
the
title
of
hero
if
he
had
perchance
he
thought
of
grumps
but
of
this
we
are
not
quite
so
sure
we
rather
think
upon
the
whole
that
he
did
dick
too
let
his
thoughts
run
away
in
the
direction
of
sweet
word
those
who
have
never
left
it
can
not
by
any
effort
of
imagination
realize
the
full
import
of
the
word
home
dick
was
a
bold
hunter
but
he
was
young
and
this
was
his
first
long
expedition
oftentimes
when
sleeping
under
the
trees
and
gazing
dreamily
up
through
the
branches
at
the
stars
had
he
thought
of
home
until
his
longing
heart
began
to
yearn
to
return
he
repelled
such
tender
feelings
however
when
they
became
too
strong
deeming
them
unmanly
and
sought
to
turn
his
mind
to
the
excitements
of
the
chase
but
latterly
his
efforts
were
in
vain
he
became
thoroughly
and
while
admitting
the
fact
to
himself
he
endeavoured
to
conceal
it
from
his
comrades
he
thought
that
he
was
successful
in
this
attempt
poor
dick
varley
as
yet
he
was
sadly
ignorant
of
human
nature
henri
knew
it
and
joe
blunt
knew
it
even
crusoe
knew
that
something
was
wrong
with
his
master
although
he
could
not
exactly
make
out
what
it
was
but
crusoe
made
memoranda
in
the
of
his
memory
he
jotted
down
the
peculiar
phases
of
his
master
new
disease
with
the
care
and
minute
exactness
of
a
physician
and
we
doubt
not
ultimately
added
the
knowledge
of
the
symptoms
of
to
his
already
stores
of
erudition
it
was
not
till
they
had
set
out
on
their
homeward
journey
that
dick
varley
spirits
revived
and
it
was
not
till
they
reached
the
beautiful
prairies
on
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
galloped
over
the
greensward
towards
the
mustang
valley
that
dick
ventured
to
tell
joe
blunt
what
his
feelings
had
been
d
know
joe
he
said
confidentially
reining
up
his
gallant
steed
after
a
sharp
gallop
d
know
i
bin
feelin
awful
low
for
some
time
past
i
know
it
lad
answered
joe
with
a
quiet
smile
in
which
there
was
a
dash
of
something
that
implied
he
knew
more
than
he
chose
to
express
dick
felt
surprised
but
he
continued
i
wonder
what
it
could
have
bin
i
never
felt
so
before
was
boy
returned
joe
how
d
know
that
the
same
way
as
how
i
know
most
things
by
experience
obsarvation
i
bin
myself
once
but
it
was
long
long
agone
dick
felt
much
relieved
at
this
candid
confession
by
such
a
bronzed
veteran
and
the
chords
of
sympathy
having
been
struck
he
opened
up
his
heart
at
once
to
the
evident
delight
of
henri
who
among
other
curious
partialities
was
extremely
fond
of
listening
to
and
taking
part
in
conversations
that
bordered
on
the
metaphysical
and
were
hard
to
be
understood
most
conversations
that
were
not
connected
with
eating
and
hunting
were
of
this
nature
to
henri
he
cried
veech
mean
bein
sik
of
hom
hah
dat
is
fat
i
am
always
be
ven
i
goes
hout
on
de

oui
vraiment
i

continued
joe
paying
no
attention
to
remark
i
always
packs
up
an
sets
off
for
home
when
i
gits
it
the
best
cure
an
when
hunters
are
young
like
you

it
the
only
cure
i
knowed

henri
idea
of
was
so
totally
opposed
to
theirs
that
his
comrades
only
laughed
and
refrained
from
attempting
to
set
him
right
the
fust
time
i
wos
took
bad
with
it
wos
in
a
country
somethin
like
that
said
joe
pointing
to
the
wide
stretch
of
undulating
prairie
dotted
with
clusters
of
trees
and
meandering
streamlets
that
lay
before
them
i

when
i
began
to
think
somehow
more
than

mother

then
joe
voice
sank
to
a
deep
solemn
tone
as
he
said
this
and
for
a
few
minutes
he
rode
on
in
silence
well
it
grew
worse
and
worse
i
dreamed
o

thought
of
it
all
day
till
i
began
to

before

days

again
joe
was
interrupted
at
this
point
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
solitary
horseman
on
the
brow
of
an
eminence
not
distant
the
three
friends
instantly
drove
their
behind
a
clump
of
trees
but
not
in
time
to
escape
the
vigilant
eye
of
the
who
uttered
a
loud
shout
which
brought
up
a
band
of
his
comrades
at
full
gallop
remember
henri
cried
joe
blunt
our
errand
is
one
of
the
caution
was
needed
for
in
the
confusion
of
the
moment
henri
was
making
preparation
to
sell
his
life
as
dearly
as
possible
before
another
word
could
be
uttered
they
were
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
about
twenty
yelling
blackfeet
indians
they
were
fortunately
not
a
war
party
and
still
more
fortunately
they
were
peaceably
disposed
and
listened
to
the
preliminary
address
of
joe
blunt
with
exemplary
patience
after
which
the
two
parties
encamped
on
the
spot
the
council
fire
was
lighted
and
every
preparation
made
for
a
long
palaver
we
will
not
trouble
the
reader
with
the
details
of
what
was
said
on
this
occasion
the
party
of
indians
was
a
small
one
and
no
chief
of
any
importance
was
attached
to
it
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
pacific
overtures
made
by
joe
were
well
received
the
trifling
gifts
made
thereafter
were
still
better
received
and
they
separated
with
mutual
expressions
of
several
other
bands
which
were
afterwards
met
with
were
equally
friendly
and
only
one
war
party
was
seen
joe
quick
eye
observed
it
in
time
to
enable
them
to
retire
unseen
behind
the
shelter
of
some
trees
where
they
remained
until
the
indian
warriors
were
out
of
sight
the
next
party
they
met
with
however
were
more
difficult
to
manage
and
unfortunately
blood
was
shed
on
both
sides
before
our
travellers
escaped
it
was
at
the
close
of
a
beautiful
day
that
a
war
party
of
blackfeet
were
seen
riding
along
a
ridge
on
the
horizon
it
chanced
that
the
prairie
at
this
place
was
almost
destitute
of
trees
or
shrubs
large
enough
to
conceal
the
horses
by
dashing
down
the
grassy
wave
into
the
hollow
between
the
two
undulations
and
dismounting
joe
hoped
to
elude
the
savages
so
he
gave
the
word
but
at
the
same
moment
a
shout
from
the
indians
told
that
they
were
discovered
look
sharp
lads
throw
down
the
packs
on
the
highest
point
of
the
ridge
cried
joe
undoing
the
lashings
seizing
one
of
the
bales
of
goods
and
hurrying
to
the
top
of
the
undulation
with
it
we
must
keep
them
at
boys
be
alive
war
parties
are
not
to
be
trusted
dick
and
henri
seconded
joe
efforts
so
ably
that
in
the
course
of
two
minutes
the
horses
were
unloaded
the
packs
piled
in
the
form
of
a
wall
in
front
of
a
broken
piece
of
ground
the
horses
picketed
close
beside
them
and
our
three
travellers
peeping
over
the
edge
with
their
rifles
cocked
while
the
savages
about
thirty
in
number
came
sweeping
down
towards
them
i
try
to
git
them
to
palaver
said
joe
blunt
but
keep
yer
eye
on
dick
an
if
they
behave
ill
shoot
the
o
the
chief
i
throw
up
my
left
hand
as
a
signal
mind
lad
do
hit
human
flesh
till
my
second
signal
is
given
and
see
that
henri
draw
till
i
git
back
to
ye
so
saying
joe
sprang
lightly
over
the
slight
parapet
of
their
little
fortress
and
ran
swiftly
out
unarmed
towards
the
indians
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
close
up
with
them
and
in
another
moment
was
surrounded
at
first
the
savages
brandished
their
spears
and
rode
round
the
solitary
man
yelling
like
fiends
as
if
they
wished
to
intimidate
him
but
as
joe
stood
like
a
statue
with
his
arms
crossed
and
a
grave
expression
of
contempt
on
his
countenance
they
quickly
desisted
and
drawing
near
asked
him
where
he
came
from
and
what
he
was
doing
there
joe
story
was
soon
told
but
instead
of
replying
they
began
to
shout
vociferously
and
evidently
meant
mischief
if
the
blackfeet
are
afraid
to
speak
to
the
he
will
go
back
to
his
braves
said
joe
passing
suddenly
between
two
of
the
warriors
and
taking
a
few
steps
towards
the
camp
instantly
every
bow
was
bent
and
it
seemed
as
if
our
bold
hunter
were
about
to
be
pierced
by
a
score
of
arrows
when
he
turned
round
and
cried
the
blackfeet
must
not
advance
a
single
step
the
first
that
moves
his
shall
die
the
second
that
moves
shall
die
to
this
the
blackfeet
chief
replied
scornfully
the
talks
with
a
big
mouth
we
do
not
believe
his
words
the
snakes
are
liars
we
will
make
no
peace
with
them
while
he
was
yet
speaking
joe
threw
up
his
hand
there
was
a
loud
report
and
the
noble
horse
of
the
savage
chief
lay
struggling
in
death
agony
on
the
ground
the
use
of
the
rifle
as
we
have
before
hinted
was
little
known
at
this
period
among
the
indians
of
the
far
west
and
many
had
never
heard
the
dreaded
report
before
although
all
were
aware
from
hearsay
of
its
fatal
power
the
fall
of
the
chief
horse
therefore
quite
paralyzed
them
for
a
few
moments
and
they
had
not
recovered
from
their
surprise
when
a
second
report
was
heard
a
bullet
whistled
past
and
a
second
horse
fell
at
the
same
moment
there
was
a
loud
explosion
in
the
camp
of
the
a
white
cloud
enveloped
it
and
from
the
midst
of
this
a
loud
shriek
was
heard
as
dick
henri
and
crusoe
bounded
over
the
packs
with
frantic
gestures
at
this
the
gaping
savages
wheeled
their
steeds
round
the
dismounted
horsemen
sprang
on
behind
two
of
their
comrades
and
the
whole
band
dashed
away
over
the
plains
as
if
they
were
chased
by
evil
spirits
meanwhile
joe
hastened
towards
his
comrades
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
for
he
knew
at
once
that
one
of
the
must
have
been
accidentally
blown
up
no
damage
done
boys
i
hope
he
cried
on
coming
up
damage
cried
henri
holding
his
hands
tight
over
his
face
oh
oui
great
damage
moche
damage
me
two
eyes
be
blowed
out
of
dere
holes
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
i
hope
said
dick
who
was
very
slightly
singed
and
forgot
his
own
hurts
in
anxiety
about
his
comrade
let
me
see
my
eye
exclaimed
joe
blunt
while
a
broad
grin
overspread
his
countenance
ye
not
improved
yer
looks
henri
this
was
true
the
worthy
hunter
hair
was
singed
to
such
an
extent
that
his
entire
countenance
presented
the
appearance
of
a
universal
frizzle
fortunately
the
skin
although
much
blackened
was
quite
uninjured
a
fact
which
when
he
ascertained
it
beyond
a
doubt
afforded
so
much
satisfaction
to
henri
that
he
capered
about
shouting
with
delight
as
if
some
piece
of
good
fortune
had
befallen
him
the
accident
had
happened
in
consequence
of
henri
having
omitted
to
replace
the
stopper
of
his
and
when
in
his
anxiety
for
joe
he
fired
at
random
amongst
the
indians
despite
dick
entreaties
to
wait
a
spark
communicated
with
the
and
blew
him
up
dick
and
crusoe
were
only
a
little
singed
but
the
former
was
not
disposed
to
quarrel
with
an
accident
which
had
sent
their
enemies
so
promptly
to
the
this
band
followed
them
for
some
nights
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
steal
their
horses
while
they
slept
but
they
were
not
brave
enough
to
venture
a
second
time
within
range
of
the
rifle
chapter
xxv
of
the
travellers
attacked
by
indians
and
delivered
in
a
remarkable
there
are
periods
in
the
life
of
almost
all
men
a
when
misfortunes
seem
to
crowd
upon
them
in
rapid
succession
when
they
escape
from
one
danger
only
to
encounter
another
and
when
to
use
a
expression
they
succeed
in
leaping
out
of
the
at
the
expense
of
plunging
into
the
fire
so
was
it
with
our
three
friends
upon
this
occasion
they
were
scarcely
rid
of
the
blackfeet
who
found
them
too
watchful
to
be
caught
napping
when
about
daybreak
one
morning
they
encountered
a
roving
band
of
camanchee
indians
who
wore
such
a
warlike
aspect
that
joe
deemed
it
prudent
to
avoid
them
if
possible
they
do
see
us
yit
i
guess
said
joe
as
he
and
his
companions
drove
the
horses
into
a
hollow
between
the
grassy
waves
of
the
prairie
an
if
we
only
can
escape
their
sharp
eyes
till
we
in
yonder
clump
o
willows
we
safe
enough
but
why
do
you
ride
up
to
them
joe
inquired
dick
and
make
peace
between
them
and
the
as
you
ha
done
with
other
bands
because
it
o
no
use
to
risk
our
scalps
for
the
chance
o
peace
wi
a
rovin
war
party
keep
yer
head
down
henri
if
they
git
only
a
sight
o
the
top
o
yer
cap
they
be
down
on
us
like
a
breeze
o
wind
ha
let
dem
come
said
henri
they
come
without
askin
yer
leave
remarked
joe
dryly
notwithstanding
his
defiant
expression
henri
had
sufficient
prudence
to
induce
him
to
bend
his
head
and
shoulders
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
reached
the
shelter
of
the
willows
unseen
by
the
savages
at
least
so
thought
henri
joe
was
not
quite
sure
about
it
and
dick
hoped
for
the
best
in
the
course
of
the
last
of
the
camanchees
was
seen
to
hover
for
a
second
on
the
horizon
like
a
speck
of
black
against
the
sky
and
then
to
disappear
immediately
the
three
hunters
vaulted
on
their
steeds
and
resumed
their
journey
but
before
that
evening
closed
they
had
sad
evidence
of
the
savage
nature
of
the
band
from
which
they
had
escaped
on
passing
the
brow
of
a
slight
eminence
dick
who
rode
first
observed
that
crusoe
stopped
and
snuffed
the
breeze
in
an
anxious
inquiring
manner
what
pup
said
dick
drawing
up
for
he
knew
that
his
faithful
dog
never
gave
a
false
alarm
crusoe
replied
by
a
short
uncertain
bark
and
then
bounding
forward
disappeared
behind
a
little
wooded
knoll
in
another
moment
a
long
dismal
howl
floated
over
the
plains
there
was
a
mystery
about
the
dog
conduct
which
coupled
with
his
melancholy
cry
struck
the
travellers
with
a
superstitious
feeling
of
dread
as
they
sat
looking
at
each
other
in
surprise
come
let
clear
it
up
cried
joe
blunt
shaking
the
reins
of
his
steed
and
galloping
forward
a
few
strides
brought
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
knoll
where
scattered
upon
the
torn
and
bloody
turf
they
discovered
the
scalped
and
mangled
remains
of
about
twenty
or
thirty
human
beings
their
skulls
had
been
cleft
by
the
tomahawk
and
their
breasts
pierced
by
the
and
from
the
position
in
which
many
of
them
lay
it
was
evident
that
they
had
been
slain
while
asleep
joe
brow
flushed
and
his
lips
became
tightly
compressed
as
he
muttered
between
his
set
teeth
their
skins
are
white
a
short
examination
sufficed
to
show
that
the
men
who
had
thus
been
barbarously
murdered
while
they
slept
had
been
a
band
of
trappers
or
hunters
but
what
their
errand
had
been
or
whence
they
came
they
could
not
discover
everything
of
value
had
been
carried
off
and
all
the
scalps
had
been
taken
most
of
the
bodies
although
much
mutilated
lay
in
a
posture
that
led
our
hunters
to
believe
they
had
been
killed
while
asleep
but
one
or
two
were
cut
almost
to
pieces
and
from
the
and
trampled
sward
around
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
struggled
long
and
fiercely
for
life
whether
or
not
any
of
the
savages
had
been
slain
it
was
impossible
to
tell
for
if
such
had
been
the
case
their
comrades
doubtless
had
carried
away
their
bodies
that
they
had
been
slaughtered
by
the
party
of
camanchees
who
had
been
seen
at
daybreak
was
quite
clear
to
joe
but
his
burning
desire
to
revenge
the
death
of
the
white
men
had
to
be
stifled
as
his
party
was
so
small
long
afterwards
it
was
discovered
that
this
was
a
band
of
trappers
who
like
those
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
volume
had
set
out
to
avenge
the
death
of
a
comrade
but
god
who
has
retained
the
right
of
vengeance
in
his
own
hand
saw
fit
to
frustrate
their
purpose
by
giving
them
into
the
hands
of
the
savages
whom
they
had
set
forth
to
slay
as
it
was
impossible
to
bury
so
many
bodies
the
travellers
resumed
their
journey
and
left
them
to
bleach
there
in
the
wilderness
but
they
rode
the
whole
of
that
day
almost
without
uttering
a
word
meanwhile
the
camanchees
who
had
observed
the
trio
and
had
ridden
away
at
first
for
the
purpose
of
deceiving
them
into
the
belief
that
they
had
passed
unobserved
doubled
on
their
track
and
took
a
long
sweep
in
order
to
keep
out
of
sight
until
they
could
approach
under
the
shelter
of
a
belt
of
woodland
towards
which
the
travellers
now
approached
the
indians
adopted
this
course
instead
of
the
easier
method
of
simply
pursuing
so
weak
a
party
because
the
plains
at
this
part
were
bordered
by
a
long
stretch
of
forest
into
which
the
hunters
could
have
plunged
and
rendered
pursuit
more
difficult
if
not
almost
useless
the
detour
thus
taken
was
so
extensive
that
the
shades
of
evening
were
beginning
to
descend
before
they
could
put
their
plan
into
execution
the
forest
lay
about
a
mile
to
the
right
of
our
hunters
like
some
dark
mainland
of
which
the
prairie
was
the
sea
and
the
scattered
clumps
of
wood
the
islands
there
no
lack
o
game
here
said
dick
varley
pointing
to
a
herd
of
buffaloes
which
rose
at
their
approach
and
fled
away
towards
the
wood
i
think
we
ha
thunder
soon
remarked
joe
i
never
feel
it
onnatteral
hot
like
this
without
lookin
out
for
a
plump
ha
den
ve
better
look
hout
for
one
goot
tree
to
get
suggested
henri
voilà
he
added
pointing
with
his
finger
towards
the
plain
dere
am
a
lot
of
wild
hosses
a
troop
of
about
thirty
wild
horses
appeared
as
he
spoke
on
the
brow
of
a
ridge
and
advanced
slowly
towards
them
hist
exclaimed
joe
reining
up
hold
on
lads
wild
horses
my
rifle
to
a
there
wilder
men
on
side
o
them
what
mean
you
joe
inquired
dick
riding
close
up
d
see
the
little
lumps
on
the
shoulder
o
each
horse
said
joe
them
injun
an
if
we
do
want
to
lose
our
scalps
better
make
for
the
forest
joe
proved
himself
to
be
in
earnest
by
wheeling
round
and
making
straight
for
the
thick
wood
as
fast
as
his
horse
could
run
the
others
followed
driving
the
before
them
the
effect
of
this
sudden
movement
on
the
wild
horses
was
very
remarkable
and
to
one
unacquainted
with
the
habits
of
the
camanchee
indians
must
have
appeared
almost
supernatural
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
every
steed
had
a
rider
on
its
back
and
before
the
hunters
had
taken
five
strides
in
the
direction
of
the
forest
the
whole
band
were
in
hot
pursuit
yelling
like
furies
the
manner
in
which
these
indians
accomplish
this
feat
is
very
singular
and
implies
great
activity
and
strength
of
muscle
on
the
part
of
the
savages
the
camanchees
are
low
in
stature
and
usually
are
rather
corpulent
in
their
movements
on
foot
they
are
heavy
and
ungraceful
and
they
are
on
the
whole
a
slovenly
and
unattractive
race
of
men
but
the
instant
they
mount
their
horses
they
seem
to
be
entirely
changed
and
surprise
the
spectator
with
the
ease
and
elegance
of
their
movements
their
great
and
distinctive
peculiarity
as
horsemen
is
the
power
they
have
acquired
of
throwing
themselves
suddenly
on
either
side
of
their
horse
body
and
clinging
on
in
such
a
way
that
no
part
of
them
is
visible
from
the
other
side
save
the
foot
by
which
they
cling
in
this
manner
they
approach
their
enemies
at
full
gallop
and
without
rising
again
to
the
saddle
discharge
their
arrows
at
them
over
the
backs
or
even
under
their
necks
this
apparently
magical
feat
is
accomplished
by
means
of
a
halter
of
which
is
passed
round
under
the
neck
of
the
horse
and
both
ends
braided
into
the
mane
on
the
withers
thus
forming
a
loop
which
hangs
under
the
neck
and
against
the
breast
this
being
caught
by
the
hand
makes
a
sling
into
which
the
elbow
falls
taking
the
weight
of
the
body
on
the
middle
of
the
upper
arm
into
this
loop
the
rider
drops
suddenly
and
fearlessly
leaving
his
heel
to
hang
over
the
horse
back
to
steady
him
and
also
to
restore
him
to
his
seat
when
desired
by
this
stratagem
the
indians
had
approached
on
the
present
occasion
almost
within
rifle
range
before
they
were
discovered
and
it
required
the
utmost
speed
of
the
hunters
horses
to
enable
them
to
avoid
being
overtaken
one
of
the
indians
who
was
better
mounted
than
his
fellows
gained
on
the
fugitives
so
much
that
he
came
within
arrow
range
but
reserved
his
shaft
until
they
were
close
on
the
margin
of
the
wood
when
being
almost
alongside
of
henri
he
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bow
henri
eye
was
upon
him
however
letting
go
the
line
of
the
which
he
was
leading
he
threw
forward
his
rifle
but
at
the
same
moment
the
savage
disappeared
behind
his
horse
and
an
arrow
whizzed
past
the
hunter
ear
henri
fired
at
the
horse
which
dropped
instantly
hurling
the
astonished
camanchee
upon
the
ground
where
he
lay
for
some
time
insensible
in
a
few
seconds
pursued
and
pursuers
entered
the
wood
where
both
had
to
advance
with
caution
in
order
to
avoid
being
swept
off
by
the
overhanging
branches
of
the
trees
meanwhile
the
sultry
heat
of
which
joe
had
formerly
spoken
increased
considerably
and
a
rumbling
noise
as
if
of
distant
thunder
was
heard
but
the
flying
hunters
paid
no
attention
to
it
for
the
led
horses
gave
them
so
much
trouble
and
retarded
their
flight
so
much
that
the
indians
were
gradually
and
visibly
gaining
on
them
we
ha
to
let
the
packs
go
said
joe
somewhat
bitterly
as
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
our
scalps
pay
if
we
do
henri
uttered
a
peculiar
and
significant
between
his
teeth
as
he
said
ve
better
stop
and
fight
dick
said
nothing
being
resolved
to
do
exactly
what
joe
blunt
bid
him
and
crusoe
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
also
said
nothing
but
bounded
along
beside
his
master
horse
casting
an
occasional
glance
upwards
to
catch
any
signal
that
might
be
given
they
had
passed
over
a
considerable
space
of
ground
and
were
forcing
their
way
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
their
necks
through
a
part
of
the
wood
when
the
sound
above
referred
to
increased
attracting
the
attention
of
both
parties
in
a
few
seconds
the
air
was
filled
with
a
steady
and
continuous
rumbling
sound
like
the
noise
of
a
distant
cataract
pursuers
and
fugitives
drew
rein
instinctively
and
came
to
a
dead
stand
while
the
rumbling
increased
to
a
roar
and
evidently
approached
them
rapidly
though
as
yet
nothing
to
cause
it
could
be
seen
except
that
there
was
a
dense
dark
cloud
overspreading
the
sky
to
the
southward
the
air
was
oppressively
still
and
hot
what
can
it
be
inquired
dick
looking
at
joe
who
was
gazing
with
an
expression
of
wonder
not
unmixed
with
concern
at
the
southern
sky
boy
i
bin
more
in
the
woods
than
in
the
clearin
in
my
day
but
i
niver
heerd
the
likes
o
that
it
am
like
said
henri
mais
it
nevair
do
stop
this
was
true
the
sound
was
similar
to
continuous
uninterrupted
thunder
on
it
came
with
a
magnificent
roar
that
shook
the
very
earth
and
revealed
itself
at
last
in
the
shape
of
a
mighty
whirlwind
in
a
moment
the
distant
woods
bent
before
it
and
fell
like
grass
before
the
scythe
it
was
a
whirling
hurricane
accompanied
by
a
deluge
of
rain
such
as
none
of
the
party
had
ever
before
witnessed
steadily
fiercely
irresistibly
it
bore
down
upon
them
while
the
crash
of
falling
snapping
and
uprooting
trees
mingled
with
the
dire
artillery
of
that
sweeping
storm
like
the
musketry
on
a
follow
me
lads
shouted
joe
turning
his
horse
and
dashing
at
full
speed
towards
a
rocky
eminence
that
offered
shelter
but
shelter
was
not
needed
the
storm
was
clearly
defined
its
limits
were
as
distinctly
marked
by
its
creator
as
if
it
had
been
a
living
intelligence
sent
forth
to
put
a
belt
of
desolation
round
the
world
and
although
the
edge
of
devastation
was
not
five
hundred
yards
from
the
rock
behind
which
the
hunters
were
stationed
only
a
few
drops
of
rain
fell
upon
them
it
passed
directly
between
the
camanchee
indians
and
their
intended
victims
placing
between
them
a
barrier
which
it
would
have
taken
days
to
cut
through
the
storm
blew
for
an
hour
then
it
travelled
onward
in
its
might
and
was
lost
in
the
distance
whence
it
came
and
whither
it
went
none
could
tell
but
far
as
the
eye
could
see
on
either
hand
an
avenue
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
was
cut
through
the
forest
it
had
levelled
everything
with
the
dust
the
very
grass
was
beaten
flat
the
trees
were
torn
shivered
snapped
across
and
crushed
and
the
earth
itself
in
many
places
was
ploughed
up
and
furrowed
with
deep
scars
the
chaos
was
indescribable
and
it
is
probable
that
centuries
will
not
quite
obliterate
the
work
of
that
single
hour
while
it
lasted
joe
and
his
comrades
remained
speechless
and
when
it
passed
no
indians
were
to
be
seen
so
our
hunters
remounted
their
steeds
and
with
feelings
of
gratitude
to
god
for
having
delivered
them
alike
from
savage
foes
and
from
the
destructive
power
of
the
whirlwind
resumed
their
journey
towards
the

fears
followed
by
a
joyful
surprise
safe
home
at
last
and
happy
one
fine
afternoon
a
few
weeks
after
the
storm
of
which
we
have
given
an
account
in
the
last
chapter
old
varley
was
seated
beside
her
own
chimney
corner
in
the
little
cottage
by
the
lake
gazing
at
the
glowing
logs
with
the
earnest
expression
of
one
whose
thoughts
were
far
away
her
kind
face
was
paler
than
usual
and
her
hands
rested
idly
on
her
knee
grasping
the
to
which
was
attached
a
stocking
on
a
stool
near
to
her
sat
young
marston
the
lad
to
whom
on
the
day
of
the
dick
varley
had
given
his
old
rifle
the
boy
had
an
anxious
look
about
him
as
he
lifted
his
eyes
from
time
to
time
to
the
widow
face
did
ye
say
my
boy
that
they
were
killed
inquired
varley
awaking
from
her
reverie
with
a
deep
sigh
every
one
replied
marston
jim
scraggs
who
brought
the
news
said
they
wos
all
lying
dead
with
their
scalps
off
they
wos
a
party
white
men
varley
sighed
again
and
her
face
assumed
an
expression
of
anxious
pain
as
she
thought
of
her
son
dick
being
exposed
to
a
similar
fate
varley
was
not
given
to
nervous
fears
but
as
she
listened
to
the
boy
recital
of
the
slaughter
of
a
party
of
white
men
news
of
which
had
just
reached
the
valley
her
heart
sank
and
she
prayed
inwardly
to
him
who
is
the
husband
of
the
widow
that
her
dear
one
might
be
protected
from
the
ruthless
hand
of
the
savage
after
a
short
pause
during
which
young
marston
fidgeted
about
and
looked
concerned
as
if
he
had
something
to
say
which
he
would
fain
leave
unsaid
varley
continued
was
it
far
off
where
the
bloody
deed
was
done
yes
three
weeks
off
i
believe
and
jim
scraggs
said
that
he
found
a
knife
that
looked
like
the
one
wot
belonged
to
to
the
lad
hesitated
to
whom
my
boy
why
do
ye
go
on
to
your
son
dick
the
widow
hands
dropped
by
her
side
and
she
would
have
fallen
had
not
marston
caught
her
o
mother
dear
do
take
on
like
that
he
cried
smoothing
down
the
widow
hair
as
her
head
rested
on
his
breast
for
some
time
varley
suffered
the
boy
to
fondle
her
in
silence
while
her
breast
laboured
with
anxious
dread
tell
me
all
she
said
at
last
recovering
a
little
did
jim
see
dick
no
answered
the
boy
he
looked
at
all
the
bodies
but
did
not
find
his
so
he
sent
me
over
here
to
tell
ye
that
he
escaped
varley
breathed
more
freely
and
earnestly
thanked
god
but
her
fears
soon
returned
when
she
thought
of
his
being
a
prisoner
and
recalled
the
tales
of
terrible
cruelty
often
related
of
the
savages
while
she
was
still
engaged
in
closely
questioning
the
lad
jim
scraggs
himself
entered
the
cottage
and
endeavoured
in
a
gruff
sort
of
way
to
reassure
the
widow
ye
see
mistress
he
said
dick
is
an
oncommon
tough
customer
if
he
could
only
git
fifty
yards
start
there
not
an
injun
in
the
west
as
could
git
hold
o
him
agin
so
do
be
takin
on
but
what
if
he
been
taken
prisoner
said
the
widow
ay
that
jest
wot
i
comed
about
ye
see
it
not
onlikely
bin
took
so
about
thirty
o
the
lads
o
the
valley

ready

now
to
start
away
and
give
the
red
riptiles
chase
an
i
come
to
tell
ye
so
keep
up
heart
mistress
with
this
parting
word
of
comfort
jim
withdrew
and
marston
soon
followed
leaving
the
widow
to
weep
and
pray
in
solitude
meanwhile
an
animated
scene
was
going
on
near
the
here
thirty
of
the
young
hunters
of
the
mustang
valley
were
assembled
actively
engaged
in
supplying
themselves
with
powder
and
lead
and
tightening
their
girths
preparatory
to
setting
out
in
pursuit
of
the
indians
who
had
murdered
the
white
men
while
hundreds
of
boys
and
girls
and
not
a
few
matrons
crowded
round
and
listened
to
the
conversation
and
to
the
deep
threats
of
vengeance
that
were
uttered
ever
and
anon
by
the
younger
men
major
hope
too
was
among
them
the
worthy
major
unable
to
restrain
his
roving
propensities
determined
to
revisit
the
mustang
valley
and
had
arrived
only
two
days
before
backwoodsmen
preparations
are
usually
of
the
shortest
and
simplest
in
a
few
minutes
the
cavalcade
was
ready
and
away
they
went
towards
the
prairies
with
the
bold
major
at
their
head
but
their
journey
was
destined
to
come
to
an
abrupt
and
unexpected
close
a
couple
of
gallop
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
one
of
those
open
plains
which
sometimes
break
up
the
woodland
near
the
verge
of
the
great
prairies
it
stretched
out
like
a
green
lake
towards
the
horizon
on
which
just
as
the
band
of
horsemen
reached
it
the
sun
was
descending
in
a
blaze
of
glory
with
a
shout
of
enthusiasm
several
of
the
younger
members
of
the
party
sprang
forward
into
the
plain
at
a
gallop
but
the
shout
was
mingled
with
one
of
a
different
tone
from
the
older
men
hist
hallo
hold
on
ye
catamounts
there
injuns
ahead
the
whole
band
came
to
a
sudden
halt
at
this
cry
and
watched
eagerly
and
for
some
time
in
silence
the
motions
of
a
small
party
of
horsemen
who
were
seen
in
the
far
distance
like
black
specks
on
the
golden
sky
they
come
this
way
i
think
said
major
hope
after
gazing
steadfastly
at
them
for
some
minutes
several
of
the
old
hands
signified
their
assent
to
this
suggestion
by
a
grunt
although
to
unaccustomed
eyes
the
objects
in
question
looked
more
like
crows
than
horsemen
and
their
motion
was
for
some
time
scarcely
perceptible
i
sees
among
them
cried
young
marston
in
an
excited
tone
an
there
three
riders
but
there
else
only
wot
it
be
i
ca
tell
ye
sharp
eyes
younker
remarked
one
of
the
men
an
i
do
ye
right
presently
the
horsemen
approached
and
soon
there
was
a
brisk
fire
of
guessing
as
to
who
they
could
be
it
was
evident
that
the
strangers
observed
the
cavalcade
of
white
men
and
regarded
them
as
friends
for
they
did
not
check
the
headlong
speed
at
which
they
approached
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
clearly
made
out
to
be
a
party
of
three
horsemen
driving
before
them
and
which
some
of
the
hunters
guessed
was
a
buffalo
calf
young
marston
guessed
too
but
his
guess
was
different
moreover
it
was
uttered
with
a
yell
that
would
have
done
credit
to
the
fiercest
of
all
the
savages
crusoe
he
shouted
while
at
the
same
moment
he
brought
his
whip
heavily
down
on
the
flank
of
his
little
horse
and
sprang
over
the
prairie
like
an
arrow
one
of
the
approaching
horsemen
was
far
ahead
of
his
comrades
and
seemed
as
if
encircled
with
the
flying
and
voluminous
mane
of
his
magnificent
horse
ha
ho
gasped
marston
in
a
low
tone
to
himself
as
he
flew
along
crusoe
i
know
ye
dog
among
a
thousand
a
buffalo
calf
ha
git
on
with
ye
this
last
part
of
the
remark
was
addressed
to
his
horse
and
was
followed
by
a
whack
that
increased
the
pace
considerably
the
space
between
two
such
riders
was
soon
devoured
hallo
dick
dick
varley
eh
why
marston
my
boy
the
friends
reined
up
so
suddenly
that
one
might
have
fancied
they
had
met
like
the
knights
of
old
in
the
shock
of
mortal
conflict
yerself
dick
varley
dick
held
out
his
hand
and
his
eyes
glistened
but
he
could
not
find
words
marston
seized
it
and
pushing
his
horse
close
up
vaulted
nimbly
off
and
alighted
on
charlie
back
behind
his
friend
off
ye
go
dick
i
take
ye
to
yer
mother
without
reply
dick
shook
the
reins
and
in
another
minute
was
in
the
midst
of
the
hunters
to
the
numberless
questions
that
were
put
to
him
he
only
waited
to
shout
aloud
we
all
safe
they
tell
ye
all
about
it
he
added
pointing
to
his
comrades
who
were
now
close
at
hand
and
then
dashing
onward
made
straight
for
home
with
little
marston
clinging
to
his
waist
like
a
monkey
charlie
was
fresh
and
so
was
crusoe
so
you
may
be
sure
it
was
not
long
before
they
all
drew
up
opposite
the
door
of
the
widow
cottage
before
dick
could
dismount
marston
had
slipped
off
and
was
already
in
the
kitchen
here
dick
mother
the
boy
was
an
orphan
and
loved
the
widow
so
much
that
he
had
come
at
last
to
call
her
mother
before
another
word
could
be
uttered
dick
varley
was
in
the
room
marston
immediately
stepped
out
and
softly
shut
the
door
reader
we
shall
not
open
it
having
shut
the
door
as
we
have
said
marston
ran
down
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
yelled
with
delight
usually
terminating
each
paroxysm
with
the
indian
with
which
he
was
well
acquainted
then
he
danced
and
then
he
sat
down
on
a
rock
and
became
suddenly
aware
that
there
were
other
hearts
there
close
beside
him
as
glad
as
his
own
another
mother
of
the
mustang
valley
was
rejoicing
over
a
son
crusoe
and
his
mother
fan
were
scampering
round
each
other
in
a
manner
that
evinced
powerfully
the
strength
of
their
mutual
affection
talk
of
holding
converse
every
hair
on
crusoe
body
every
motion
of
his
limbs
was
eloquent
with
silent
language
he
gazed
into
his
mother
mild
eyes
as
if
he
would
read
her
inmost
soul
supposing
that
she
had
one
he
turned
his
head
to
every
possible
angle
and
cocked
his
ears
to
every
conceivable
elevation
and
rubbed
his
nose
against
fan
and
barked
softly
in
every
imaginable
degree
of
modulation
and
varied
these
proceedings
by
bounding
away
at
full
speed
over
the
rocks
of
the
beach
and
in
among
the
bushes
and
out
again
but
always
circling
round
and
round
fan
and
keeping
her
in
view
it
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
and
young
marston
sat
down
on
a
rock
deliberately
and
enthusiastically
to
gloat
over
it
but
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
part
of
it
has
not
yet
been
referred
to
there
was
yet
another
heart
there
that
was
glad
exceeding
glad
that
day
it
was
a
little
one
too
but
it
was
big
for
the
body
that
held
it
grumps
was
there
and
all
that
grumps
did
was
to
sit
on
his
haunches
and
stare
at
fan
and
crusoe
and
wag
his
tail
as
well
as
he
could
in
so
awkward
a
position
grumps
was
evidently
bewildered
with
delight
and
had
lost
nearly
all
power
to
express
it
crusoe
conduct
towards
him
too
was
not
calculated
to
clear
his
faculties
every
time
he
chanced
to
pass
near
grumps
in
his
elephantine
gambols
he
gave
him
a
passing
touch
with
his
nose
which
always
knocked
him
head
over
heels
whereat
grumps
invariably
got
up
quickly
and
wagged
his
tail
with
additional
energy
before
the
feelings
of
those
canine
friends
were
calmed
they
were
all
three
ruffled
into
a
state
of
comparative
exhaustion
then
young
marston
called
crusoe
to
him
and
crusoe
obedient
to
the
voice
of
friendship
went
are
you
happy
my
dog
you
a
stupid
fellow
to
ask
such
a
question
however
it
an
amiable
one
yes
i
am
what
do
want
ye
small
bundle
o
hair
this
was
addressed
to
grumps
who
came
forward
innocently
and
sat
down
to
listen
to
the
conversation
on
being
thus
sternly
questioned
the
little
dog
put
down
its
ears
flat
and
hung
its
head
looking
up
at
the
same
time
with
a
deprecatory
look
as
if
to
say
oh
dear
i
beg
pardon
i
i
only
want
to
sit
near
crusoe
please
but
if
you
wish
it
i
go
away
sad
and
lonely
with
my
tail
much
between
my
legs
indeed
i
will
only
say
the
word
but
but
i
stay
if
i
might
poor
bundle
said
marston
patting
its
head
you
can
stay
then
hooray
crusoe
are
you
happy
i
say
does
your
heart
bound
in
you
like
a
cannon
ball
that
wants
to
find
its
way
out
and
ca
eh
crusoe
put
his
snout
against
marston
cheek
and
in
the
excess
of
his
joy
the
lad
threw
his
arms
round
the
dog
neck
and
hugged
it
vigorously
a
piece
of
impulsive
affection
which
that
noble
animal
bore
with
characteristic
meekness
and
which
grumps
regarded
with
idiotic
satisfaction
chapter
xxvii
feast
at
the
and
crusoe
come
out
the
closing
the
day
of
dick
arrival
with
his
companions
was
a
great
day
in
the
annals
of
the
mustang
valley
and
major
hope
resolved
to
celebrate
it
by
an
impromptu
festival
at
the
old
for
many
hearts
in
the
valley
had
been
made
glad
that
day
and
he
knew
full
well
that
under
such
circumstances
some
must
be
devised
for
the
escape
of
overflowing
excitement
a
messenger
was
sent
round
to
invite
the
population
to
assemble
without
delay
in
front
of
the
with
celerity
the
summons
was
obeyed
men
women
and
children
hurried
towards
the
central
point
wondering
yet
more
than
half
suspecting
what
was
the
major
object
in
calling
them
together
they
were
not
long
in
doubt
the
first
sight
that
presented
itself
as
they
came
trooping
up
the
slope
in
front
of
the
was
an
ox
roasting
whole
before
a
gigantic
bonfire
tables
were
being
extemporized
on
the
broad
level
plot
in
front
of
the
gate
other
fires
there
were
of
smaller
dimensions
on
which
sundry
steaming
pots
were
placed
and
various
joints
of
wild
horse
bear
and
venison
roasted
and
sent
forth
a
savoury
odour
as
well
as
a
pleasant
hissing
noise
the
inhabitants
of
the
were
brewers
and
the
result
of
their
recent
labours
now
stood
displayed
in
a
row
of
goodly
casks
of
beer
the
only
beverage
with
which
the
dwellers
in
these
regions
were
wont
to
regale
themselves
the
whole
scene
as
the
cooks
moved
actively
about
upon
the
lawn
and
children
romped
round
the
fires
and
settlers
came
flocking
through
the
forests
might
have
recalled
the
revelry
of
merry
england
in
the
olden
time
though
the
costumes
of
the
far
west
were
perhaps
somewhat
different
from
those
of
old
england
no
one
of
all
the
band
assembled
there
on
that
day
of
rejoicing
required
to
ask
what
it
was
all
about
had
any
one
been
in
doubt
for
a
moment
a
glance
at
the
centre
of
the
crowd
assembled
round
the
gate
of
the
western
fortress
would
have
quickly
enlightened
him
for
there
stood
dick
varley
and
his
mother
and
his
loving
dog
crusoe
there
too
stood
joe
blunt
like
a
bronzed
warrior
returned
from
the
fight
turning
from
one
to
another
as
question
poured
in
upon
question
almost
too
rapidly
to
permit
of
a
reply
there
too
stood
henri
making
enthusiastic
speeches
to
whoever
chose
to
listen
to
him
now
glaring
at
the
crowd
with
clenched
fists
and
growling
voice
as
he
told
of
how
joe
and
he
had
been
tied
hand
and
foot
and
lashed
to
poles
and
buried
in
leaves
and
threatened
with
a
slow
death
by
torture
at
other
times
bursting
into
a
hilarious
laugh
as
he
held
forth
on
the
predicament
of
mahtawa
when
that
wily
chief
was
treed
by
crusoe
in
the
prairie
young
marston
was
there
too
hanging
about
dick
whom
he
loved
as
a
brother
and
regarded
as
a
perfect
hero
grumps
too
was
there
and
fan
do
you
think
reader
that
grumps
looked
at
any
one
but
crusoe
if
you
do
you
are
mistaken
grumps
on
that
day
became
a
regular
an
incorrigible
utter
and
perfect
nuisance
to
everybody
not
excepting
himself
poor
beast
grumps
was
a
dog
of
one
idea
and
that
idea
was
crusoe
out
of
that
great
idea
there
grew
one
little
secondary
idea
and
that
idea
was
that
the
only
joy
on
earth
worth
mentioning
was
to
sit
on
his
haunches
exactly
six
inches
from
crusoe
nose
and
gaze
steadfastly
into
his
face
wherever
crusoe
went
grumps
went
if
crusoe
stopped
grumps
was
down
before
him
in
an
instant
if
crusoe
bounded
away
which
in
the
exuberance
of
his
spirits
he
often
did
grumps
was
after
him
like
a
bundle
of
mad
hair
he
was
in
everybody
way
in
crusoe
way
and
being
so
to
speak
beside
himself
was
also
in
his
own
way
if
people
trod
upon
him
accidentally
which
they
often
did
grumps
uttered
a
solitary
yell
proportioned
in
intensity
to
the
excruciating
nature
of
the
torture
he
endured
then
instantly
resumed
his
position
and
his
fascinated
stare
crusoe
generally
held
his
head
up
and
gazed
over
his
little
friend
at
what
was
going
on
around
him
but
if
for
a
moment
he
permitted
his
eye
to
rest
on
the
countenance
of
grumps
that
creature
tail
became
suddenly
imbued
with
an
amount
of
wriggling
vitality
that
seemed
to
threaten
its
separation
from
the
body
it
was
really
quite
interesting
to
watch
this
unblushing
and
disinterested
and
utterly
reckless
display
of
affection
on
the
part
of
grumps
and
the
amiable
way
in
which
crusoe
put
up
with
it
we
say
put
up
with
it
advisedly
because
it
must
have
been
a
very
great
inconvenience
to
him
seeing
that
if
he
attempted
to
move
his
satellite
moved
in
front
of
him
so
that
his
only
way
of
escaping
temporarily
was
by
jumping
over
grumps
head
grumps
was
everywhere
all
day
nobody
almost
escaped
trampling
on
part
of
him
he
tumbled
over
everything
into
everything
and
against
everything
he
knocked
himself
singed
himself
and
scalded
himself
and
in
fact
forgot
himself
altogether
and
when
late
that
night
crusoe
went
with
dick
into
his
mother
cottage
and
the
door
was
shut
grumps
stretched
his
ruffled
battered
and
dishevelled
little
body
down
on
the
thrust
his
nose
against
the
opening
below
the
door
and
lay
in
humble
contentment
all
night
for
he
knew
that
crusoe
was
there
of
course
such
an
occasion
could
not
pass
without
a
rifles
were
brought
out
after
the
feast
was
over
just
before
the
sun
went
down
into
its
bed
on
the
western
prairies
and
the
nail
was
soon
surrounded
by
bullets
tipped
by
joe
blunt
and
jim
scraggs
and
of
course
driven
home
by
dick
varley
whose
silver
rifle
had
now
become
in
its
owner
hand
a
weapon
races
too
were
started
and
here
again
dick
stood
and
when
night
spread
her
dark
mantle
over
the
scene
the
two
best
fiddlers
in
the
settlement
were
placed
on
empty
and
some
danced
by
the
light
of
the
monster
fires
while
others
listened
to
joe
blunt
as
he
recounted
their
adventures
on
the
prairies
and
among
the
rocky
mountains
there
were
sweethearts
and
wives
and
lovers
at
the
feast
but
we
question
if
any
heart
there
was
so
full
of
love
and
admiration
and
gratitude
as
that
of
the
widow
varley
as
she
watched
her
son
dick
throughout
that
merry
evening
years
rolled
by
and
the
mustang
valley
prospered
missionaries
went
there
and
a
little
church
was
built
and
to
the
blessings
of
a
fertile
land
were
added
the
far
greater
blessings
of
christian
light
and
knowledge
one
sad
blow
fell
on
the
widow
varley
heart
her
only
brother
daniel
hood
was
murdered
by
the
indians
deeply
and
long
she
mourned
and
it
required
all
dick
efforts
and
those
of
the
pastor
of
the
settlement
to
comfort
her
but
from
the
first
the
widow
heart
was
sustained
by
the
loving
hand
that
dealt
the
blow
and
when
time
blunted
the
keen
edge
of
her
feelings
her
face
became
as
sweet
and
mild
though
not
so
lightsome
as
before
joe
blunt
and
henri
became
leading
men
in
the
councils
of
the
mustang
valley
but
dick
varley
preferred
the
woods
although
as
long
as
his
mother
lived
he
hovered
round
her
cottage
going
off
sometimes
for
a
day
sometimes
for
a
week
but
never
longer
after
her
head
was
laid
in
the
dust
dick
took
altogether
to
the
woods
with
crusoe
and
charlie
the
wild
horse
as
his
only
companions
and
his
bible
in
the
breast
of
his
and
soon
dick
the
bold
hunter
and
his
dog
crusoe
became
renowned
in
the
frontier
settlements
from
the
banks
of
the
yellowstone
river
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
many
a
grizzly
bear
did
the
famous
silver
rifle
lay
low
and
many
a
wild
exciting
chase
and
adventure
did
dick
go
through
but
during
his
occasional
visits
to
the
mustang
valley
he
was
wont
to
say
to
joe
blunt
and
henri
with
whom
he
always
sojourned
that
nothin
he
ever
felt
or
saw
came
up
to
his
grand
dash
over
the
western
prairies
into
the
heart
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
in
saying
this
with
enthusiasm
in
his
eye
and
voice
dick
invariably
appealed
to
and
received
a
ready
affirmative
glance
from
his
early
companion
and
his
faithful
loving
friend
the
dog
crusoe
the
end
